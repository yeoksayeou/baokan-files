　　Peace Warrior – The Poet Neruda
　　Yuan Shuipai
　　During the World Peace Congress meeting that lasted from November 20th until the morning of the next day, a slow and sorrowful voice came from the podium in the middle of the night, accusing the capitalist countries of persecuting peace advocates: “In Latin America, the United States, France, Italy, Africa, and the Near East, hundreds of thousands of peace advocates are thrown into prisons. Peace gatherings are banned. Peace warriors are shot and killed on the streets by the police…” Then the voice, like poetry, shook people’s hearts: “We hear many unparalleled heroic stories. We know the places where those excellent comrades fell. We salute all peace warriors who suffer police terror. We will never forget them…”

　　His accusation became the unanimous accusation of all the delegates. His protest became the unanimous protest of the peace-loving people of the world. His proposal became the resolution of the conference—that is, the "Resolution on the Persecution of Peace Warriors," which consists of only nine sentences but burns with angry emotion and is full of courage and confidence—one of the three historical documents of the Second World Peace Congress.

　　The proposer was Pablo Neruda, the greatest poet of Chile and of all the Americas, and the glorious recipient of this year's International Peace Prize.

　　He comes from South America, from Chile. There, the servants of the Wall Street monopolists are entrenched. Truman attempts to turn Latin America into a reliable rear base for American imperialism, into a supply area for raw materials and cannon fodder for aggressive wars against the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and the new China. Through its claws, American imperialism brutally suppresses the democratic movements of the people there and persecutes peace advocates. In Brazil, Argentina, and Bolivia, thousands of signatories of the Stockholm Appeal were arrested by reactionary governments, even shot or left to die in prison. The Cuban and Mexican delegations attending this conference, including 200 representatives led by Toledano, were once detained in Cuba, and the reactionary government had no choice but to release them after mass protests and demonstrations. The representative of Paraguay showed everyone a bloody shirt at the conference, the entire back of which was dyed red. The owner of the shirt, a Paraguayan university student, was killed for advocating peace. Apart from Latin America, peace fighters are also suffering the same persecution wherever the octopus feet of American imperialism with its suction cups can reach. Therefore, Neruda's angry, fighting voice received unanimous response from the conference hall.

　　The poet himself is a victim of persecution. He cannot return to his homeland of Chile, where the reactionary ruler González Videla has prepared prisons and bullets, waiting for him. Videla, the leader of the Radical Party, was elected president in the general election in September 1946 due to the victory of the Democratic United Front, which included the Chilean Communist Party. He swore to implement democratic politics, protect workers' rights, and carry out land reform. Neruda also served as a member of parliament at that time. But in less than a year, Videla betrayed the people, overturned the reforms, and sold the country's sovereignty to the United States. In April 1947, the reactionary government expelled the Communist Party members from the cabinet, declared the Communist Party illegal, and massacred striking miners; in October, it successively severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and formed an anti-communist alliance with Argentina and Brazil. Neruda was accused of treason. But on January 6, 1948, in the parliament, he openly accused the Chilean president of betraying his country. His two-hour just appeal won the support of all the Chilean people, and at the same time, it incurred the more perverse anger of the fascist rulers. The poet was wanted and forced to flee. Not only could he not stay in Chile, but the police detectives all over South America, nurtured by Wall Street, were chasing him everywhere, sniffing out his trail. During his exile, this singer belonging to the Chilean people was given a good opportunity to contact the workers of his homeland more and to understand more deeply their lives full of suffering and struggle. His thoughts and feelings also merged more closely with them. He walked through one city after another, one town after another, one mountain village after another, and one seaport after another. Artisans, coachmen, sailors, engineers, shoemakers, vineyard farmers, miners, tinsmiths, and their white-haired mothers, young wives… received him as if he were their own relatives, diligently and at the greatest risk, letting him stay in their poor wooden houses, avoiding the pursuit of Videla's hounds. The poet wrote this period of life in that beautiful long poem "The Fugitive":

　　Thus it was, night after night,
　　In that long dark time,
　　The coast of all Chile falling in night,
　　I passing from one door to another,
　　A fugitive.
　　Everywhere in the land of my country
　　The humble hut and the hands
　　Waiting for my footsteps...
　　All doors opened for me,
　　All people said: "He is my brother,
　　Bring him into this poor hut."

　　How could the reactionary government of Chile arrest such a Communist Party member of parliament and writer who was supported by the people? But at that time, progressive writers in Europe and the Americas were worried about Neruda's safety. At the World Congress of Cultural Workers for Peace held in Poland on August 25, 1948, progressive writers led by Picasso unanimously protested against Neruda's persecution. In the Soviet Union, Ehrenburg and other famous writers and artists also jointly protested against the atrocities of the Chilean authorities. On the night of April 25, 1949, the last day of the First World Peace Congress in Paris, the poet, who was cared for and missed by everyone, suddenly appeared unexpectedly on the podium of the conference. His old friend Ehrenburg excitedly recorded this exciting scene in his article, saying that Neruda "victoriously avoided the tracking of the American police. He stepped onto the podium like a warrior stepping onto the battlefield... Miners from Scotland, female teachers from Korea, Joliot-Curie, railway workers from Poland, and the famous Soviet aviator Maresyev—people of different countries and different jobs—listened to his language with unanimous enthusiasm, although they could not understand it, but they understood each other's hearts. At that time, a French worker couldn't restrain himself and shouted happily: 'Pablo Neruda! It's really Pablo Neruda!'... I embraced him. I unfolded his recent works. He and his courage, his beautiful and great poems—are always with us." At that conference, he recited some of his recent works.

　　After the closure of this Warsaw conference, the Polish Peace Committee and the Polish Writers' Association held an international poetry recital. Poets from various countries participated in the recital: Simonov and Tikhonov from the Soviet Union (the former recited his old work "At the Canadian Assembly Hall", and the latter read his newly composed "For the Most Beautiful Happiness in the World" at the Warsaw Conference), Xiao San from China, Gamara from France, Albertini from Spain (Dai Wangshu had translated many of his poems), black poet Luke Mann, Polish poet Broniewski, and a total of a dozen poets from Lithuania, Tashkent, India, and other places. Neruda, who shared the peace prize in the literature category with Turkish poet Hikmet for his poem "Let the Woodcutter Awaken", was the first to step onto the stage to recite his poems amidst the enthusiastic applause of nearly a thousand spectators who filled the hall and the attic.

　　He is a tall, burly man in his forties, half bald, slightly obese, with a pair of kind and sincere eyes on his dark face. He recited calmly and slowly, not looking at the manuscript in his hand much, his voice was soft, and those Spanish rhymes with rich overtones flowed smoothly into people's ears, like the sound of a murmuring stream. I couldn't understand Spanish, nor could I understand the Polish and Russian translations. But fortunately, I had read some English translations of Neruda's works in the past, so I understood that what he was reading was a short poem commemorating Miguel Hernández, a revolutionary youth who was murdered in a Spanish prison (Xu Chi has a Chinese translation, published in "Mass Poetry"). This poem is sad and angry; it contains deep love and also vents sharp hatred, such as the following sentences:

　　Let them know, those who killed you,
　　They will pay with blood.
　　Let them know, those who tortured you,
　　They will meet me one day.

　　But when we heard him recite this poem, our poet was almost expressionless. He didn't try to show anything outwardly like an actor whose skills were not up to par. But from his soft, slightly high-pitched voice, we understood his love for the Spanish people and his disgust and curse for the fascist rulers. Only at one time did he change his imperceptible expression, and I saw him raise his head, close his eyes, and frown while reciting... I thought this was when he recited the most painful part.

　　The memory of the heroic defense of Madrid, the image of the excellent soldiers of Spain, I am afraid, occupies his heart no matter where he is? The Spanish Civil War was an important turning point for him to recognize the sins of capitalism, to change his thinking, and to change his creative style. The brutal German and Italian fascists, with the connivance and help of British and French imperialism, used planes and artillery to suppress the newborn people's regime in Spain, massacred women and children in Madrid, and also shot the excellent folk poet Lorca. Neruda, the Chilean consul in Madrid who originally wrote difficult-to-understand poems, began to stand on the side of the people from this time on, and from then on used his pen to fight fascism together with the soldiers of the Spanish government army and the International Brigade. After international imperialism strangled Spain, like all revolutionaries, Neruda not only did not have the slightest pessimism, but became more determined and brave; he not only used his pen but also used all his work and actions, his whole life, to devote himself to the revolutionary struggle. When the shadow of fascism shrouded Europe and several countries fell under the Nazi iron heel, he officially became a Communist Party member. After one battle after another, he finally saw the victory of Stalingrad and the destruction of Hitler and Mussolini. With incomparable joy and a strong belief in socialism, he praised Stalingrad, praised the Red Army, praised the "mother of the world's people"—the Soviet Union, and praised the great Stalin!

　　The approximately 700-line "Let the Woodcutter Awaken" sings the socialist countries’ peaceful construction and praises the greatness of the new human Soviet people in many paragraphs. The author uses image-rich words to explain that this powerful fortress of world peace is invincible. He issued a strong warning to the American imperialists:

　　If you go to touch this fortress, you will fall,
　　Like coal in a factory to be destroyed...

　　The author calls on the American people not to let themselves be dragged into new wars of aggression by the warmongers. He warns them that wherever their boots step, the people there will surely rise up to resist them and eliminate them, whether in Spain, France, Greece, Venezuela, Chile, Peru, Italy, Bulgaria... or China, the people everywhere will rise up against American imperialism and fiercely strike the aggressors. This is a poem full of tender love and surging fighting spirit. He uses strong poetic sentences to declare to the enemy the words in the hearts of the people of the world: We love peace, so we must use all our strength to eliminate the bandits who dare to destroy peace!

　　The author is very honored to have met this poet, whom I have admired for several years, at the peace prize award ceremony on the closing day of the conference, and also to have heard his recitation of poems at the poetry evening, and to have had the opportunity to talk with him.

　　He was very happy that his poems could have Chinese translations. He said, "How much I care about you! I often remember you." He paused, his huge body lying in the sofa, his pensive eyes looking ahead. I thought he might be recalling those nights of exile in Chile, when he thought of the powerful people's forces in the distant East who were driving out the same remnant forces who sold the people and the country to American capitalists.

　　"The victory of China has greatly encouraged the colonial people... Did you see that I wrote about China in my poems?" he asked me.

　　I told him that I had read it in more than one place. In "The Woodcutter", he wrote prophetically:

　　Do not land
　　China: Chiang Kai-shek, that running dog, will no longer be there,
　　And welcoming you will be the peasants'
　　Sickles covering the mountains and plains and a volcano of landmines.

　　He smiled and said, "But at that time, Chiang was still there."

　　He talked about the Chinese Communist Party and the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong. He respected Chairman Mao and excitedly inscribed a few words on the Chinese translation of "The Woodcutter": "Long live, Mao! Long live the Chinese people! Pablo Neruda, 1950."

　　In the poem mourning the Spanish revolutionaries mentioned above, he also specifically mentioned Chairman Mao, using this glorious name to comfort his fallen comrades:

　　Miguel, far from the Osona prison,
　　Far from the cruelty, Mao Zedong leads your devastated poems,
　　Fighting towards our victory.

　　The poet sees the victory of China as their victory as well. Yes, this victory belongs to everyone, to "us", to the people of the whole world!

　　When the Americas Conference was held in Mexico City last September, Neruda also encouraged the peace advocates of the Americas in his report, saying: "We are very honored and happy to live in this era, in which a poet has won a war that is enough to change the fate of tens of millions of human beings. The name of this poet is Mao Zedong."

　　As Ehrenburg said, as a warrior, it is not easy to detect from his appearance. He speaks slowly and in a soft tone. His movements, such as turning a book or lighting a cigarette, are very light and leisurely. In order to find a collection of his Spanish poems for me, he searched slowly several times on every table in the hotel room before finding it. But, on the other hand, his upright face, calm posture, and honest eyes are consistent with his poems. He is profound, and his heart contains love for the world. His poems are often very long, as if he can't express all his love. His tender lyricism makes readers intoxicated, making it difficult for readers to believe that those spicy sarcasms and contemptuous curses come from the same poet. Perhaps it is because he has so much love that he has such deep hatred.

　　In the conversation, he mentioned the American spy Roach who made a shameless speech at the conference. For the first time, I saw this simple poet give a contemptuous laugh, saying with a witty irony, "Did you hear? Roach wants China to take Tito's path!"

　　I said, "Since you care so much about China, I hope you can travel to our China." He said that he would be very happy to have this opportunity, but he is very busy now, running around everywhere, and he would like to have a house to live in for a period of time so that he can write. He was very happy with the four issues of "People's Pictorial" that I gave him. He hoped that I would often send him some things so that he could understand China and the life and struggle of the Chinese people from pictures and works of art.

　　I wanted to talk to him more about poetry and about Chile, but he was urged several times to go to the meeting, so I had to say goodbye to him.

　　After returning to China, Comrade Xiao San told me that Neruda had said to him, "When you go back and see Mao Zedong, please tell him that I love him, I love him very much." Hearing such affectionate words, I seemed to see again the simple face of a dark man from that distant country in South America. This country is now occupied by American imperialism, but its people have awakened, and they have bravely shouted to their rulers, the running dogs of imperialism, the loud slogan "Not a single soldier for foreign countries!"

　　和平战士——诗人奈鲁达
    袁水拍
    在十一月二十日一直开到第二天早晨的和大会议上，半夜的时候，讲台上传来一个迟缓而沉痛的声音，它控诉资本主义国家内和平拥护者所遭受的迫害：“在拉丁美洲、美国、法国、意大利、非洲和近东，成千成万的和平拥护者被投入牢狱。和平集会遭到禁止。和平战士在街上被警察开枪杀死。……”接着那声音像诗句一样震动着人心：“我们听到许多无比的英雄故事。我们知道那些优秀的同志们倒下去的地方。我们向所有遭受警察恐怖的和平战士致敬。我们永远忘不了他们。……”
    他的控诉成为全体代表一致的控诉。他的抗议成为世界爱好和平人民一致的抗议。他的提案成为大会的决议——就是那一共只有九句话，但是燃烧着愤怒的感情和充满着勇气与信心的《关于和平战士遭受迫害问题的决议》——二届和大的三个历史性的文件之一。
    那提案人就是智利的，也是全美洲的，最伟大的诗人，本届国际和平奖金的光荣获得者巴勃罗·奈鲁达。
    他来自南美洲，来自智利。那里盘踞着华尔街的独占资本家的仆从们。杜鲁门企图把拉丁美洲变做美帝国主义的可靠的后方，变做反苏、反人民民主国家、反新中国的侵略战争的原料与炮灰的供给地。美帝通过它的爪牙，残暴地镇压那里人民的民主运动，迫害和平拥护者。在巴西、阿根廷、玻利维亚，数以千计的在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名者被反动政府逮捕，甚至枪杀或者瘐死狱中。此次出席大会的古巴和墨西哥代表团，包括托里达诺在内的二百名代表，就曾经在古巴遭到拘禁，经过群众的抗议示威，反动政府才不得不将他们释放。巴拉圭的代表在大会上曾把一件整个背部染红了的血的衬衣举起来给大家看。衣服的主人，巴拉圭的一个大学生，就是为了拥护和平而被杀死的。除了拉丁美洲，其他凡是美帝国主义这章鱼的具有吸盘的脚能够伸去的地方，和平斗士们也都遭受着同样的迫害。因此奈鲁达的愤怒的，战斗的呼声获得了会场一致的回响。
    诗人本人就是一个被迫害者。他不能回到他的祖国智利去，那里的反动统治者刚萨勒兹·魏地拉准备了牢房和枪弹，守候着他。急进党领袖魏地拉曾由于包括智利共产党在内的民主联合阵线的胜利，在一九四六年九月大选中，当选为总统。他宣誓实施民主政治，保护工人权利，进行土地改革。奈鲁达也在那时任国会议员。但是不到一年，魏地拉就叛变人民，推翻改革，把国家的主权出卖给美国。一九四七年四月反动政府将共产党阁员排出内阁，宣布共产党为非法，屠杀罢工的矿工；十月间先后与苏联、捷克斯拉夫绝交，和阿根廷、巴西组成反共阵线。奈鲁达被控叛国罪。但是他反而在一九四八年一月六日，在国会，公开控告了智利总统的背叛祖国的罪状。他的两小时的正义的申诉博得了全智利人民的拥护，同时也招受了法西斯统治者的更乖戾的愤怒。诗人遭到通缉，被迫逃亡。非但在智利他不能存身，整个南美洲的受华尔街畜养的警察侦探，到处追逐着他，嗅着他的踪迹。在流亡时期内，这个属于智利人民的歌者反而得到了一个很好的机会，去更多地接触祖国的劳动者，更深刻地了解他们的充满苦难和斗争的生活。他的思想和感情也更密切地和他们融合。他穿走着一个城市又一个乡镇，一个山村又一个海港。工匠、马夫、水手、工程师、鞋匠、葡萄园的农民、矿工、锡匠和他们的白发的母亲，年青的妻子……都像接待自己的亲人一般殷勤地，同时也冒着最大的危险，留他住在他们的贫穷的木屋里，躲避魏地拉的猎犬们的追逐。诗人把这一段生活写在那首美丽的长诗《逃亡者》中：
    就是这样，一夜又一夜，
    在那漫长的黑暗的时间里，
    全智利的海岸降落着夜幕，
    我从一扇门走到另一扇门，
    一个逃亡者。
    祖国土地上的每一处的
    卑微的小屋和双手
     期待着我的足音。…………
    所有的门都为我而开，
    所有的人都说：“他是我的兄弟，
    请带他到这所穷苦的小屋里。”
    智利的反动政府怎么能逮捕到这样一个受人民拥护的共产党议员和作家呢？但是当时欧洲和美洲的进步作家们都担心着奈鲁达的安全。在一九四八年八月二十五日波兰举行的世界文化工作者保卫和平大会上，以毕卡索为首的进步作家们一致抗议奈鲁达的受迫害。在苏联，爱伦堡和其他著名文学家和艺术家也联名抗议智利当局的暴行。在一九四九年四月二十五日，巴黎一届和大的最后一天的夜间，这位被大家关心着，挂念着的诗人却意外地突然出现在大会的讲台上。他的老友爱伦堡在他的文章里激动地记载着这一兴奋的场面，他说奈鲁达“胜利地避开了美洲警察的跟踪。他走上讲台，像战士走上战场……从苏格兰来的矿工，从朝鲜来的女教师，约里奥——居里，从波兰来的铁路工人，和有名的苏联飞行家曼雷塞也夫——不同国家的不同工作的人民——一致热忱地倾听他的语言，虽则听不懂，可是心心相印。当时有一个法国工人不能自持地，愉快地喊叫了起来：‘巴勃罗·奈鲁达！这真是巴勃罗·奈鲁达啊！’……我拥抱他。我展开他的近作。他和他的勇敢，他的美妙而胸怀伟大的诗篇——永远和我们在一起。”在那次大会上他朗诵了他的最近的一些作品。
    在这一次华沙大会闭幕后，波兰和平委员会和波兰作家协会召开了一个国际诗歌朗诵会。参加朗诵的有各国诗人：苏联的西蒙诺夫和吉洪诺夫（前者朗诵了他的旧作《在加拿大会场上》，后者念的是他刚在华沙大会上作的《为了世界上最美好的幸福》），中国的萧三，法国的加玛尔拉，西班牙的亚尔倍蒂（戴望舒曾译过他好些诗），黑人诗人鲁克曼，波兰诗人布朗尼奥斯基，以及立陶宛、塔什克、印度等地一共十几位诗人。这个为了《让那伐木者醒来》一诗而和土耳其诗人希克梅特共同获得文学部门的和平奖金的奈鲁达，在挤满了大厅和阁楼的近千观众的热烈掌声中，第一个走到台前去朗诵他的诗篇。
    他是一个高大魁伟的四十多岁的人，半秃顶，略显肥胖，微黑的脸上长着一对忠厚而诚恳的眼睛。他安详地迟缓地念着，不大看手里的稿子，他的声音是柔软的，那些带着丰富的谐音的西班牙语韵脚，和顺地流入人们耳中，好像是一条喃喃的小溪所发出的声音。我听不懂西班牙文，也听不懂波兰语和俄语的两种翻译。可是幸亏过去已经读过一些英译的奈鲁达的作品，所以了解他所读的是他纪念一个被谋害在西班牙狱中的革命青年，密盖尔·艾南台斯的一首短诗（中国已有徐迟的中译，载《大众诗歌》）。这首诗是悲伤的，也是愤怒的；它包孕着深厚的爱，也泄吐着锋利的仇恨，如像这样的句子：
    叫他们晓得，杀你的人，
    他们要用血偿命。
    叫他们晓得，给你上刑的人，
    他们有一天要见我的面。
    可是当我们听他念这首诗的时候，我们的诗人几乎是没有表情的。他不像一个技巧不大到家的演员那样，在外形上努力去表现什么。但是从他的轻轻的调子微高的声音中，我们体会了他对西班牙人民的爱和对法西斯统治者的厌恶和诅咒。只有在一个时候，他改变了他的不易觉察的表情，我看见他抬起头来，一边念着，一边闭着眼，绉着眉……我想这是他念到那最沉痛的地方了吧。
    玛德里的英勇保卫战的记忆，西班牙的优秀的子弟兵的面影，恐怕无论在什么地方，都占据着他的心灵的吧？西班牙内战是使他认识资本主义的罪恶，使他的思想转变和改变创作作风的重要契机。残暴的德意法西斯在英法帝国主义的纵容和帮助之下，用飞机和大炮镇压西班牙的新生的人民的政权，他们屠杀了马德里的妇女小孩，也枪毙了优秀的民谣诗人洛尔加。原来写着难懂的诗的智利驻玛德里领事奈鲁达从这时候开始站到人民这一边来，从此用他的笔和西班牙政府军和国际纵队的战士们一起向法西斯主义作战。在国际帝国主义把西班牙扼死后，和所有的革命者一样，奈鲁达不但没有丝毫悲观，并且更坚定勇敢；不但用他的笔而且用他的一切工作和行动，用他整个的生命投入了革命斗争。在法西斯的阴影掩罩在欧洲，好几个国家沦陷在纳粹铁蹄下的时候，他正式成为一个共产党员。一个战斗接着一个战斗，他终于看见了斯大林格勒的胜利，看见了希特勒和墨索里尼的覆灭。他以无比欢欣的心情，和对社会主义的坚强的信念，歌颂斯大林格勒，歌颂红军，歌颂“世界人民的母亲”——苏联，歌颂伟大的斯大林！
    约七百行的《让那伐木者醒来》以不少的篇幅歌唱着社会主义国家的和平建设事业和赞美着新的人类苏维埃人的伟大。作者用形象丰富的字句说明这个世界和平的强大堡垒是不可战胜的。他向美帝国主义者发出有力的警告：
    如果你要去碰碰这座堡垒，你就会倒下，
    像工厂里的煤一般被消灭……
    作者呼吁美国人民不要让他们自己被战争贩子们拖进新的侵略战争中去。他告诫他们，无论他们的皮靴踏到那里，那里的人民一定会起来抵抗他们，消灭他们，无论西班牙、法国、希腊、委内瑞拉、智利、秘鲁、意大利、保加利亚……以及中国，到处的人民都将起来反对美帝国主义，痛击侵略者。这是一首满溢着温柔的爱情和激荡着斗志的诗。他用强烈的诗句向敌人宣告全世界人民心里的一句话：我们爱和平，因此我们要用一切力量来消灭敢于破坏和平的匪贼！
    笔者很荣幸地能在大会闭幕那天的和平奖金给奖会上认识了这位三数年来敬仰着的诗人，也在诗歌晚会上听到他的朗诵诗，并有机会谈了一些话。
    他非常高兴他的诗能有中文译本。他说，“我是多么关心你们啊！我时常记着你们。”他停了一停，他的巨大的躯体躺在沙发里，沉思的眼睛望着前面。我想他也许是在回忆着那些在智利各处流亡的黑夜，当时他怎样想到在遥远的东方，强大的人民的力量正在驱除同样一个出卖人民和祖国给美国资本家的残余势力。
    “中国的胜利给殖民地人民以极大的鼓舞……你看见我在诗里写到中国吗？”他问我。
    我告诉他，我读到不止一处。在《伐木者》中，他这样预言似地写着：
            不要登陆
    中国：蒋介石这只走狗不再会在那儿，
    而迎接你的，将是漫山遍野的农民的
    镰刀和一座地雷的火山。
    他微笑地说，“可是，那时候，蒋还在。”
    他谈到了中国共产党和中国人民的领袖毛泽东。他敬重毛主席，兴奋地在《伐木者》的中译本上题了几个字：“万岁，毛！万岁，中国人民！巴勃鲁·奈鲁达，一九五○。”
    在上面所提到的那首悼念西班牙革命者的诗中，他也特别提到了毛主席，用这个光辉的名字来安慰他的已经牺牲的战友：
    密盖尔啊，远离奥松那监狱，
    远离残酷，毛泽东率领着你的被摧残的诗歌，
    战斗着，走向我们的胜利。
    诗人是把中国的胜利看成也是他们的胜利的。是的，这胜利是大家的，是“我们”的，是全世界人民的！
    去年九月美洲和大在墨西哥城开会时，奈鲁达在他的报告中也曾经鼓励全美洲的和平拥护者们说：“我们很光荣，也很幸福，能够活在这个时代里，在这个时代里，一个诗人打胜了一个足以改变千千万万人类命运的战争。这个诗人的名字是毛泽东。”
    正如爱伦堡所说的，作为一个战士的他，在外表上却不易觉察出来。他说话迟缓，音调柔和。他的动作，例如翻一本书，点一枝烟，都是很轻轻的，悠闲的。为了要找一本他的西班牙原文的诗集给我，他在旅馆的房间里，每一张桌子上，慢慢地找了几遍才找到。但是，从别一方面看来，他的正直的面貌，从容的姿态，诚实的眼光，是和他的诗一致的。他深厚，他的胸怀里包含着对世界的爱。他的诗常常写得很长很长，仿佛说不尽他的爱似的。他的温柔的抒情使读者心醉，使读者难以相信那些辛辣的讥刺，充满鄙夷的诅咒也出于同一个诗人之手。也许正因为他有这样多的爱，才有那样深的恨吧。
    在谈话中，他提到了在大会上发表无耻演说的美国特务罗奇。我第一次看见这位朴质的诗人发出轻蔑的笑声，带着俏皮的讽刺说，“你听见吗？罗奇要中国走铁托的路！”
    我说，“你既然这样关心中国，希望你能够到我们中国去旅行一次。”他说很愿意有这个机会，可是现在事情很忙，各处跑，很想有一间房子住下来一个时期，可以写作。他很高兴我送给他的四期《人民画报》，他希望我常常寄一些东西给他，可以让他从图片和艺术作品中了解中国和中国人民的生活和斗争。
    我很想再和他谈谈关于诗，关于智利，可是外面已经来催他几次去开会，只得向他告辞。
    回国以后，萧三同志告诉我，奈鲁达曾经这样对他说，“当你回去，见到毛泽东的时候，请你告诉他，我爱他，我很爱他。”听到这样深情的话，我仿佛又看见了这个南美洲的遥远的国家的一个微黑的诚朴的面影。这个国家今天正被美帝霸占着，可是它的人民已经觉醒，他们勇敢地向他们的统治者帝国主义的走狗喊出了“不为外国出一个兵！”的响亮的口号。（附图片）
