Economic Life Dynamics

　　Northeast China Vigorously Purchases Surplus Grain from Rural Areas

　　After the Northeast People's Government issued a decision to purchase new grain last October, the state-owned grain company immediately led various commercial and economic organizations to actively purchase surplus grain from farmers. In the past three months, the amount of grain purchased in Northeast China has reached 161.6 percent of the same period in 1949, solving many problems for farmers. However, Northeast China had a bumper harvest last year, and farmers still have a lot of grain in storage. State-owned grain companies should better organize cooperatives and private merchants to continue helping farmers sell their surplus grain.

　　Chen Yusheng, a Worker at North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant, Rescues a Transformer

　　At 4:00 PM on December 11th last year, the transformer in the substation of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant exploded and caught fire due to a broken high-voltage fuse. Chen Yusheng, a worker at the plant, discovered this and, disregarding the danger of electric shock, rushed into the flames and forcefully closed the high-voltage oil switch. The plant's 500-kilowatt transformer was thus saved, allowing 800 workers to continue working. Chen Yusheng's three fingers that closed the high-voltage oil switch were also burned and he lost consciousness due to the electric shock. This noble spirit of self-sacrifice moved all the employees of the plant to work harder. At the plant's model worker evaluation meeting at the end of last year, Chen Yusheng was named a special-class model of factory protection.

　　Fuzhou City Determines Firewood Production Task for the First Half of the Year

　　The production task for firewood in Fuzhou City for the first half of this year was decided at the city's first firewood industry conference earlier this month to be 4,608 pieces (1,000 boxes per piece), of which 184 pieces will be used to reward progressive manufacturers and make appropriate adjustments. The remaining 3,896 pieces will be produced by mechanized factories, and 528 pieces by handcraft factories.

　　East China Grain Company Focuses on Grain Purchases to Prevent Grain Price Decline

　　Since mid-November of last year, grain prices in East China generally declined, with rice prices falling the most, with market prices averaging 15 percent lower than the state-owned company's listed prices. In order to protect the interests of farmers, the state-owned grain company conducted focused purchases in major grain distribution towns and areas where grain prices had fallen excessively in various provinces and regions in December. By mid-December, local grain market prices gradually rose, approaching listed prices. As of the beginning of January, the market price of rice in Shanghai was 10.8 percent higher than in late December of last year. Currently, general market prices in southern Jiangsu and Shandong have reached parity with listed prices.

　　Fuzhou Discovers More Than a Thousand New Public Real Estate Properties

　　After August of last year, the Fuzhou Municipal Finance Bureau comprehensively launched a general investigation of public real estate. During the investigation, 1,354 new public real estate properties were discovered, which are estimated to increase the city's fiscal revenue by more than 20,000 catties of rice per month. In order to handle this carefully, the bureau has listed and announced the newly discovered real estate.

　　Hunan's Tax Arrears Reach More Than 5 Billion Yuan

　　The total amount of tax arrears in Hunan Province is still more than 5.35 billion yuan, of which industrial and commercial tax arrears are the largest, amounting to 2.3 billion yuan, and slaughter tax arrears are 1.9 billion yuan. In terms of regions, cities have more arrears than towns. The fact that the industrial and commercial situation has improved proves that the tax arrears are not a matter of heavy burden, but rather the stubborn habits of some backward merchants coupled with the timidity of some tax cadres, which has fueled the unhealthy trend of tax arrears. Tax authorities should pay attention to handling this in a timely manner to avoid affecting national fiscal revenue.

　　Hebei Farmers Actively Use Cotton to Pay Public Grain

　　During the autumn grain collection last year, the People's Government stipulated that cotton could be used to pay public grain, and the price ratio between cotton and grain was reasonable and fair. For example, every catty of medium-grade seed cotton could be converted into 3.5 taels of millet. The general public felt that paying with cotton was worthwhile, so they actively paid with cotton. Cooperatives in various places also actively cooperated with this cotton collection work. In two days, the Handan Special District and Qiu County alone had 600,000 catties of seed cotton in storage. From late October to early December, the total amount of seed cotton collected in Handan, Hengshui, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Xingtai, Tianjin, and Ding, Cang, and Tong Special Districts exceeded the task by 9.214 percent.
