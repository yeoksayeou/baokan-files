　　My Learning Experience in the Agricultural University's Model Worker Class
　　Labor Model Qi Zengshan
　　Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people have become masters of the country. I understand that production is for ourselves and for the country. Last August, when the government recommended me to study at the Agricultural University's Model Worker Class, I felt extremely happy.

　　When I came to the school, the villagers gave me a mission: to bring back advanced agricultural science and technology.

　　In these six months of study, the teachers wished they could teach us all their good methods completely. However, our education level is really too low to record all the knowledge the teachers have taught us. In summary, I have the following gains:

　　(1) In the field of plant pathology: I learned that there are three kinds of sorghum smut: loose smut, kernel smut, and head smut. Treatment: Soak seeds in 56°C hot water for five minutes, soak seeds in copper sulfate solution, mix seeds with copper carbonate; or rotate crops and use the "two open and one cool" method (i.e., two parts boiling water and one part cool water) to soak seeds.

　　Prevention and control of wheat nematode disease (peppercorn): Use salt water to remove diseased seeds, or plant wheat again after two or three years.

　　Wheat black smut can be prevented and controlled by mixing seeds with copper carbonate, Wang copper powder, or Guronsan.

　　There are three types of wheat yellowing disease: yellow stripe rust, leaf rust, and stem rust. Currently, there is no good way to combat it, only to select rust-resistant varieties, ensure ventilation in the wheat fields, or frequently hoe and loosen the soil to maintain moisture underground and dryness on the soil surface.

　　There are more than 20 kinds of cotton diseases, which can be treated by soaking seeds in boiling water to kill the disease spores, or by mixing seeds with organic mercury agents, Guronsan, and crop rotation to reduce diseases.

　　(2) In the field of soil science: I understood that to improve the soil, we must apply more organic fertilizer, or deep plow and frequently hoe. Chemical fertilizers should be used in combination with organic fertilizers, and quick-acting fertilizers and slow-acting fertilizers should be applied separately.

　　Nitrogen fertilizer promotes leaf growth, phosphorus fertilizer promotes fruit growth, and potassium fertilizer promotes root and stem growth.

　　In addition, crops also need magnesium, iron, calcium..., but the soils of North China generally do not lack these.

　　Alkaline soils should be treated with acidic fertilizers, and acidic soils should be treated with lime (alkaline).

　　There is a large amount of nitrogen in the air, but general crops cannot absorb it. Leguminous crops have rhizobia, which, through the action of the rhizobia, convert the nitrogen in the air into nitrogen that plants can absorb, but it is necessary to apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. Leguminous crops grow very well when intercropped with other crops. This is because rhizobia provide them with nitrogen. When I plant soybeans at home every year, I intercrop them with corn, and they grow very well. Now I understand this principle.

　　Bone meal is a very good phosphorus fertilizer, and we can collect various animal bones for crude processing.

　　(3) In the field of entomology: I understood their living habits. Insects with sucking mouthparts can be treated with emulsions; insects with chewing mouthparts can be treated with toxic pesticides. The breathing pores of insects are mostly in the abdomen, and the small oil droplets in the emulsion can block their pores, causing them to suffocate and die.

　　(4) In the field of horticulture: I learned that pyrethrum is a very good pesticide that can guarantee increased cotton production. Last September, I mailed a package of pyrethrum seeds given to me by the school to the technical research group in my hometown. After they received it, they immediately planted it in the ground and had a considerable harvest. My fellow villagers plant a lot of cotton, and the insect pests are very serious every year. With pyrethrum in the future, they will not be afraid of the aphid enemy.

　　(5) In the field of agricultural chemistry: I learned how to make pyrethrum flowers into powder and liquid and their application methods.

　　Sulfur powder and liquid can eliminate cotton red spiders, providing another guarantee for increased cotton production.

　　Cottonseed oil can be made into an emulsion to eliminate aphids. Soap can mix the emulsion with water or the medicine with water, and can enhance the efficacy of the medicine. I must teach this method to everyone when I return to my hometown.

　　(6) In the field of agronomy: In the past, we did not pay much attention to seed selection, only leaving the solid ears as seeds during threshing. Now, I understand that this method of seed selection is unscientific, because when we select seeds in the field, we don't know whether it will lodge in the field, and at the same time, healthy ears and diseased ears are mixed together, which is very easy to get a lot of disease spores. If we plant it in the ground the following year, it will still get diseases.

　　This learning gain is inseparable from Michurin's theory. In the future, I will study hard and combine it with China's reality to produce greater results.

　　我在农大劳动模范班的学习心得
    劳动模范  齐增山
    在共产党、毛主席领导下，人民都当了国家的主人。我明白：生产是为了自己为了国家。去年八月间政府保送我到农大劳动模范班学习时，我感到万分的高兴。
    来校时，老乡们给了我一个任务：把先进的农业科学和技术带回去。
    在这半年学习中，先生们恨不得把他们的好办法完全教给我们。但是，我们的文化程度实在太低了，不能把先生们所教给的知识都记录下来。总起来说，我有如下的收获：
    （一）在植物病理学方面：我知道了高粱的黑穗病有三种：散黑穗病、粒黑穗病和黑头病。治法：５６°Ｃ热水浸种五分钟、硫酸铜水浸种、碳酸铜拌种；或轮作及二开一凉（即开水二份凉水一份）浸种。
    小麦线虫病（胡椒粒）的防治法：用盐水把病籽剔出，或隔二、三年再种麦子。
    小麦黑穗病，可用碳酸铜、王铜粉、谷仁乐生拌种防治。
    小麦黄疸病有三种：黄条锈病、叶锈病、秆锈病。目前尚无对抗它的好办法，只有选抗锈的品种，使麦田通风，或勤锄松土，保持地下有水分而土面干燥。
    棉花的病害多至二十余种，可用开水浸种把病胞浸死，或用有机汞剂、谷仁乐生拌种及轮作，减轻病害。
    （二）在土壤学方面：我懂得了要改良土壤必须多施有机质肥料，或深耕勤锄。化学肥料要与有机肥料混合使用，速性肥料与迟性肥料应分别施用。
    氮肥长叶子，磷肥长果实，钾肥长根茎枝。
    此外，庄稼尚需镁、铁、钙……，但华北土壤多不缺此。
    碱性土壤要施酸性肥料，酸性土壤要加石灰（碱性）。
    空气中有多量的氮素，但一般作物不能吸收。豆科作物有根瘤菌，经过根瘤的作用，将空气中之氮变为植物能吸收的氮，但需施用磷钾肥料。豆科作物与其他作物间作，都长得很好，这是因根瘤菌供给它以氮的缘故。我在家每年种大豆时，与玉米间作，长得都很好。现在我明白了这个道理。
    骨粉是很好的磷肥，我们可收集各种畜骨，加以粗制。
    （三）昆虫学方面：我懂得了它们的生活习性。吸收口器的昆虫，能用乳剂除治；咀嚼口器的昆虫，可用毒性农药除治。昆虫的吸气孔多在腹部，乳剂中的小油珠能把它的气孔闭塞，使它窒息而死。
    （四）园艺学方面：我知道了除虫菊是一种很好的农药，能保障棉花的增产。去年九月间，我把学校送给我的一包除虫菊种籽邮到本乡的技术研究组。他们收到后立刻就种到地里，收获相当大。我村乡亲们多种棉花，每年虫害很严重，今后有了除虫菊，就不怕蚜虫这个敌人了。
    （五）农业化学方面：我学会了怎样将除虫菊的花制成粉剂和液剂及其应用法。
    硫磺粉及液体，可以除治棉花红蜘蛛，使棉花增产又有了保障。
    棉籽油制成乳剂，可除治蚜虫。肥皂能使乳剂与水混合或药剂与水混合，并能增强药力。我回乡后一定要把此法传授给大家。
    （六）农艺学方面：过去，我们对选种是不甚重视的，只是在打场时把结实的穗留下做种子。现在，我明白了这一选种方法是不科学的，因为我们在场里选种时，根本不知道它在田里是否倒伏，同时健康的穗和病穗混在一起，极易沾上很多病胞子，倘翌年将它种在地里，仍会发生病害。
    这个学习收获是和米邱林学说分不开的，今后我要努力学习，把它和中国实际结合起来，使它产生更大的成果。
