Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 6th—According to TASS, Pyongyang, January 5th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced on the 5th that after the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers defeated the enemy forces stubbornly resisting in the suburbs of Seoul and entered Seoul on January 4th, they immediately occupied all government office buildings, radio stations, and transportation facilities, and expelled all remnants of the enemy from all districts of the city. The Seoul People's Committee immediately began work after the liberation of the capital. Various democratic parties and people's organizations have also resumed their activities. The liberated people of Seoul warmly welcome the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the people of Seoul are now actively participating in the restoration of the capital.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 6th: In Pyongyang, which has suffered from the frenzied devastation and destruction by the U.S. invading army, democratic order and normal life are rapidly recovering. Scattered soldiers and armed special agents of the remnants of the Li Seung-man army have been basically eliminated. The Pyongyang People's Committee and people's government organs at all levels, which persisted in underground work during the enemy's occupation, have gradually resumed normal work and have received enthusiastic support from the citizens. Citizens who had left Pyongyang to avoid persecution by the U.S.-Li gangs are now returning one after another.

State-owned stores, consumer cooperatives, and people's markets have resumed business one after another, guaranteeing the supply of daily necessities for citizens. Thousands upon thousands of citizens are enthusiastically participating in restoration work and supporting the front lines. Roads and bridges destroyed or damaged by the invading army have been completely restored. Workers and technicians who have returned to their factories are working day and night, regardless of the enemy planes' frenzied bombing. Thanks to their selfless labor, city telephone service was restored on December 16th of last year, and tap water was restored on December 24th. Repair work on electric lights and telecommunications equipment is also underway.

Coal miners led by manager Kim Hyung-jerk engaged in guerrilla warfare with weapons in hand during the U.S.-Li army's occupation, and have now returned to their mines to resume work, and have begun partial production. Kim Sung-hak, Chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee, told this agency's reporter that all the citizens of Pyongyang, who have regained their freedom from the clutches of the U.S.-Li gangs, are very grateful for the righteous assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers. An atmosphere of internationalist friendship and victorious joy permeates the entire city. With unwavering confidence and deep hatred for the U.S.-Li gangs, the people of Pyongyang are determined to repay the assistance of the Chinese people and strive for the final victory in the war of liberation of the motherland by rapidly restoring various constructions and actively supporting the front lines.
