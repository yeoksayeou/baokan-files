　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 8th: According to TASS, Czechoslovak President Gottwald stated in his New Year's broadcast speech that in 1950, Czechoslovakia's industrial production grew at an unprecedented rate. The production plan was 100% completed, exceeding pre-war levels by 50%, or 80% per capita. Heavy industry production increased by 15.4% compared to 1949, and the production level of heavy machinery industry exceeded 1949 by 25%, more than 50% higher than in 1948. In agriculture, 1950 marked the beginning of a historic shift from small and scattered production methods to collective production in cooperatives. An agricultural cooperative, or a preparatory committee for a cooperative, was established in every two villages. The cultivated land of agricultural cooperatives exceeded one million hectares, accounting for more than 22% of the total cultivated land in the country, including state-owned farms. Thanks to the successful completion of the production plan, the people's living standards have improved, and the consumption of food and industrial products is rapidly increasing. Wages in industry increased by 26%, and farmers' incomes increased by 19%. In 1950, trade with the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries accounted for 55% of the total foreign trade.
    President Gottwald further pointed out that Czechoslovakia's people's democratic regime, the National Front, the fraternal alliance of the Czech and Slovak peoples, and the local people's regime organs have been greatly strengthened. President Gottwald discussed the increasing strength of the world peace movement in 1950 and called on the Czech people to strive for new victories in the struggle to defend peace and build socialism.
