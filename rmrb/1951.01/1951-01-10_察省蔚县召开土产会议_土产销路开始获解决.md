Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Yuxian County, Chahar Province, held a native produce conference, establishing production and sales contracts and organizing joint private businesses, beginning to resolve the sales channel problem for the county's native produce.

Yuxian County has a large quantity of native produce, but sales have been consistently poor in recent years. The annual output value of only fourteen major products, such as white hemp, pig bristles, wooden goods, and egg products, is equivalent to more than 26.8 million catties of rice. If all the county's native produce could be sold, the 320,000 residents of the county would each increase their income by the equivalent of 84 catties of millet per year. Therefore, resolving the production and sales issues of native produce plays a very important role in the economic life of local farmers.

In order to solve this problem, the Yuxian County People's Government convened the heads of relevant finance, trade, and cooperative departments, as well as representatives of local private merchants and those from Beijing, Tianjin, and other places who came to the county to purchase native produce, and held a native produce conference in mid-November. Everyone at the meeting studied the basic reasons for the sluggish sales of local native produce, which were due to non-standard products, high costs, and unstable prices. For example, before the Anti-Japanese War, each bundle of hemp rope had 96 strands, each strand being 7 feet long; later, this gradually decreased to only 20-odd strands per bundle, which were both short and thin, and some even mixed in soil with water. After liberation, the People's Government failed to promptly urge producers to change their old habits, so merchants were unwilling to buy and sell. Woodenware such as pickaxe and shovel handles, due to inconvenient transportation, high freight costs, and high costs, private merchants were also unwilling to buy and sell. In the past, the prices of native produce were also very unstable due to the local People's Government's insufficient control. For example, the prices of local medicinal materials were very low, and farmers suffered losses, but when merchants from afar came to buy them, either local producers would raise prices sharply, forcing merchants to return empty-handed, or private merchants would flock to buy them, causing fluctuations in the prices of medicinal materials.

Based on the above situation, the native produce conference held in Yuxian County this time first decided to sign production and sales contracts between private merchants and producers to improve the quality of native produce. These production and sales contracts will stipulate the specifications of the products and the reasonable prices that producers should receive. Secondly, in order to reduce the cost of native produce, the participants unanimously agreed that it is necessary to organize joint private businesses to reduce freight costs. For example, according to the accurate calculations of the private merchant representatives present at the meeting: transporting one hundred pickaxe and shovel handles, joint operation can reduce the freight cost by more than half compared to single operation. In addition, the Yuxian County People's Government accepted the opinions put forward by everyone regarding the insufficient leadership in the production and sales of native produce, and stated that it will resolutely strengthen the control of native produce prices in the future, organize a large number of joint operations, launch the signing of mutually beneficial production and sales contracts, and supervise their implementation, while also preparing to repair necessary roads to facilitate transportation.

Because this conference resolved the issues of sales channels for local native produce and the reasonable interests of the three parties involved in production, transportation, and sales, the representatives of all parties present at the meeting were very satisfied. Two hemp merchants from Tianjin believed that as long as everyone can implement the contract system and restore pre-war specifications, 600,000 catties of hemp can be exported this year, which is equal to the normal pre-war export volume of hemp in the county. Liu Zishun, a medicine merchant from Yigongyi, said: If the sulfur industry can be organized and started, he will first order 20,000 catties. Pig bristle merchants and woodenware businesses organized joint operations after the meeting, with the former planning to export 800 catties of pig bristles and 10,000 catties of pig hair this winter; the latter is actively promoting woodenware sales to Datong and Chaigoupu. Tianjin hemp merchants have also signed a contract with local hemp shops to purchase more than 4,200 catties of hemp rope.

　　察省蔚县召开土产会议
    土产销路开始获解决
    【新华社八日讯】察哈尔蔚县召开土产会议，订定产销合同，组织私商联营，开始解决了该县土产的销路问题。
    蔚县土产数量很大，但近年来销路始终不畅。该县仅白麻、猪鬃、木货、蛋品等十四种主要产品的年产总值就折米二千六百八十多万斤。如果能把全县土产全部推销出去，以全县三十二万人口计，每人每年将增加收入折值小米八十四斤。因此，土产产销问题的解决，在该地农民经济生活中，占着很重要的地位。
    蔚县人民政府为解决这一问题，曾召集该地有关财经、贸易、合作社部门的负责人、当地的以及京、津等地去该县收购土产的私商代表，在十一月中旬举行了土产会议。大家在会上研究出该地土产滞销的基本原因是由于产品不合规格，成本高，价格不稳。如麻绳在抗战前每捆九十六条，每条长七尺；以后逐渐减少为每捆只有二十多条，又短又细，有的并渗土使水。解放以后人民政府未能及时督促生产者改变旧习，以致商人不愿收售。镐、锹木柄等木器，因交通不便、运费大、成本高，私商也不愿收售。过去土产价格又因当地人民政府掌握不够而很不稳，例如当地药材价格很低，农民吃亏，但当远道商人来收买时，或因本地产户猛抬价钱，商人只好空手而回，或因私商云集抢购，又造成药价波动。
    根据上述情况，蔚县此次召开的土产会议首先决定订定私商和生产者的产销合同，以提高土产质量。这种产销合同将规定产品的规格和生产者应得的合理的价格。其次，为了减低土产品成本，与会者一致认为必须组织私商联营以减轻运费。例如，据到会私商代表精确计算：运一百根镐、锹木柄，联营比单营的运费可减少一半还多。此外，蔚县人民政府接受了大家所提的对土产产销工作领导不够的意见，表示今后决加强土产价格的掌握，大量组织联营，发动产销互利合同的订定，并监督其执行，同时并准备整修必要道路以便利运输。
    由于此次会议解决了该地土产的销路和产、运、销三方的合理利益问题，与会各方代表都很满意。天津两家麻商认为只要大家都能实行合同制，恢复战前规格，今年可输出麻六十万斤，等于该县麻产战前正常输出量。公益厚药商刘子顺表示：如果把硫磺业组织起来开了工，他将首先定购二万斤。猪鬃商、木货业更在会议以后组织了联营，前者计划在今冬输出猪鬃八百斤，猪毛一万斤；后者正向大同、柴沟堡大量推销木货。天津麻商亦和当地麻店订定了收购麻绳四千二百余斤的合同。
