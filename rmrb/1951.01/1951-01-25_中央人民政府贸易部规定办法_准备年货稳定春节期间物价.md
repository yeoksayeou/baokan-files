Regulations of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government:
    Prepare New Year Goods to Stabilize Prices During the Spring Festival

[This newspaper report] The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, in order to protect the lives of the working people, has stipulated the policy of stabilizing prices during the Spring Festival: resolutely stabilize market wholesale prices at the current listed price level, and try to stabilize retail prices as much as possible. At the same time, specific measures were stipulated, instructing state-owned trading institutions in various regions to make sufficient preparations first, and lay the foundation for price stability when the market opens after the Spring Festival.

The Ministry noted that during the Spring Festival last year, some private merchants took advantage of the holiday period of state-owned trading institutions to carry out large-scale speculative activities and drive up the prices of major commodities; especially retail prices, which had a great impact on the lives of the working people. For example, in Tianjin last year, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month, the retail prices of raw oil, edible salt, white sugar, kerosene, and cigarettes all increased by about one time; the prices of commodities not operated by state-owned trading institutions such as meat and vegetables increased by more than two times. Although prices across the country have stabilized over the past year, the strength of state-owned trade materials has increased, and the number of retail institutions has increased, it is expected that prices will not fluctuate greatly during the Spring Festival this year, but because speculative factors in the market still exist, fluctuations may still occur in some areas and in some commodities. In order to learn from the experience and lessons of last year, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions to commercial administrative departments and trading companies in various regions, stipulating specific measures as follows:

1. State-owned wholesale trade shall not close until Lunar New Year's Eve, and shall open on the fourth day of the first lunar month. Wholesale listed prices shall remain unchanged from before the New Year. Retail companies shall operate as usual on Lunar New Year's Eve and prepare to open on the second day of the first lunar month in case of fluctuations on the first day. Major and medium-sized cities should immediately check the reserves and deployment of major materials to ensure a large supply to the market.

2. If there are fluctuations in the retail prices of department stores at the beginning of the year, department store outlets should open early, and may temporarily sell daily necessities needed by the working people for the New Year, such as candies and cigarettes, in conjunction with retail companies.

3. Local trade administrative departments should convene meetings of various daily necessities industries, call on private merchants to practice the patriotic pact, strengthen administrative management, and promptly punish merchants who excessively raise prices.

4. Where possible, local trust companies, native product companies, retail companies, and cooperatives may organize temporary joint wholesale and retail operations for commodities that are prone to fluctuations, such as meat and vegetables.

### 中央人民政府贸易部规定办法  准备年货稳定春节期间物价

　　中央人民政府贸易部规定办法
    准备年货稳定春节期间物价
    【本报讯】中央人民政府贸易部为保障劳动人民生活，规定春节期间稳定物价方针：在现在牌价水平上，坚决稳定市场批发价格，并尽量稳定零售价格。同时规定了具体办法，指示各地区国营贸易机构，先作足够准备，并为春节后开市时物价稳定打下基础。
    该部以去年春节期间，部分私商趁国营贸易机构休假期间，曾大事进行投机活动，哄抬主要物资价格；尤其是零售价格，对劳动人民生活影响很大。如天津在去年自夏历除夕至正月初六，生油、食盐、白糖、煤油、纸烟的零售价均上涨一倍左右；国营贸易机构未经营的商品如肉类、菜蔬则上涨达两倍余。虽然一年来全国各地物价已趋稳定，国营贸易物资力量增大，以及零售机构增加，预计今年春节期间物价不会有大的波动，但因市场的投机因素依然存在，还有可能在局部地区和部分商品上发生波动。中央人民政府贸易部为了接受去年的经验教训，故于最近向各地区商业行政部门及贸易公司发出指示，规定具体办法如下：
    一、国营批发贸易一律到夏历除夕始能休业，正月初四开张，批发牌价照年前不变。零售公司在夏历除夕照常营业，并准备如在初一发生波动时，初二即行开业。各大、中城市应即检查主要物资储备及部署情况，保证对市场大量供应。
    二、年初百货零售价格，如有波动时，百货公司门市部应提前开业，并可结合零售公司临时出售劳动人民过年所需要的日用百货如糖果、纸烟等。
    三、各地贸易行政部门应召集各日用品行业举行会议，号召私商实践爱国公约；加强行政管理；并对过分抬高物价的商人及时予以处分。
    四、在可能情况下，各地可组织信托公司、土产公司、零售公司、合作社举办对肉类、菜蔬等易于波动的商品临时性的批发与零售联营业务。
