Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, held in Beijing from November 27th to December 6th last year, passed the "Resolution on Determining the Current Central Political Task of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Protecting the Home and Defending the Country." The full text of the resolution is as follows:

"The purpose of the war of aggression against Korea launched by American imperialism is not only to annex Korea but also to invade China and then invade Asia and conquer the world. This barbaric atrocity and arrogant attempt have now been fully exposed to the people of the world. The democratic parties of China issued a joint declaration on November 4th of this year (referring to 1950), clearly pointing out the close connection between the survival of Korea and the safety of China, and pointing out that the Chinese people, in order to defend the motherland, support their neighbors, and strive for lasting peace in the world, vow to support the heroic and just actions of the People's Volunteer Army in aiding Korea with all their strength. Our party is a member of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front and deeply remembers Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of revolution to save the country, alliance with the Soviet Union against imperialism, and striving for the independence and freedom of oppressed nations in the world. We believe that resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting the home and defending the country is not only the common sacred task of all Chinese people today but also the historical mission that our party should have.

To this end, we must first carry out universal and in-depth propaganda and education work within the party and among the broad masses of the people, so that every comrade and the broad masses of the people can deeply understand that American imperialism is the most cunning, insidious, and ferocious aggressor against the Chinese people in the past hundred years, and is currently using the old trick of the Japanese invaders who first invaded Korea and then invaded China, directly endangering our national security. If we want to save ourselves, we must save our neighbors; if we want to guarantee national construction and strive for world peace, we must resist atrocities and stop aggression; all paralyzing thoughts of closing the door and seeking temporary safety must be eliminated. We must make every comrade and the broad masses of the people deeply understand that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and also the mortal enemy of the people all over the world. It is extremely isolated and is a paper tiger that is outwardly strong but inwardly weak and decadent; all pro-American reactionary thoughts and muddled thoughts of fearing and worshiping America must be eliminated. Since the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have fought side by side, they have changed the Korean war situation, defeated the American army's general offensive, and shattered the aggressors' arrogant plans. This fact makes people deeply realize that the Chinese people can indeed defend the motherland and defeat aggression; especially, China stands in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and forms an invincible and powerful force with the people of the world, which will surely completely eliminate the imperialists' aggression and defend the lasting peace of the world; all wavering thoughts that lack confidence in the strength of the Chinese people and the people of the world must be eliminated.

Comrades of our party must not only improve themselves and educate others in the protracted struggle of resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting the home and defending the country, but also translate correct understanding and firm confidence into action, actively play a backbone role among the broad masses of the people and the masses connected by our party, and serve the frontline support and all voluntary mobilization work. We must be especially vigilant and strictly prevent imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang from carrying out conspiracies and sabotage, or a few pro-American elements from mixing into our ranks and undermining our actions to resist America and aid Korea. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we must closely unite with all democratic parties based on the position of the Common Program, take uniform steps, and strengthen the people's democratic united front. We must resolutely support the government and support the army, implement government orders, cooperate with the government to consolidate national defense, ensure public security, suppress bandits and special agents, complete land reform, increase production, stabilize financial and commodity prices, and consolidate economic, financial, cultural, and educational construction; we must intensify our work and complete our tasks in our own positions, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship in all aspects. All work concerning the consolidation and development of the party's organization and the strengthening of the party's propaganda and education should be combined with the movement to resist America and aid Korea, protect the home and defend the country.

The Second Plenary Session of our party was held at the high tide of the heroic and victorious advance of our People's Volunteer Army and the nationwide upsurge of resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting the home and defending the country. We solemnly resolve to determine that resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting the home and defending the country is our current central political task, and call on all party comrades to rise up together, carry forward the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, act together with the people of the whole country, and strive to implement the joint declaration of the democratic parties and complete this major and glorious task!"

　　民革二中全会通过决议
    以抗美援朝保家卫国为当前中心任务
    【新华社三日讯】去年十一月二十七日至十二月六日在北京举行的中国国民党革命委员会第二届第二次中央委员会全体会议，曾通过“确定抗美援朝保家卫国为该党当前中心政治任务的决议”。决议全文如下：
    “美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争，其目的不止于要吞并朝鲜，而是要侵略中国，并进而侵略亚洲和征服全世界；这种野蛮的暴行和狂妄的企图，到现在已经完全暴露在全世界人民面前了。中国各民主党派本年（指一九五○年）十一月四日发表联合宣言，明白指出朝鲜存亡与中国安危的密切关联，指出中国人民为了保卫祖国、为了支援邻邦、为了全世界的持久和平，誓以全力拥护人民志愿援朝英勇正义的行动。本党是中国人民民主统一战线中的一员，并深念孙中山先生生前革命救国联苏反帝及争取世界被压迫民族独立自由的主张，认为抗美援朝保家卫国不但是今日全中国人民共同的神圣任务，也正是本党所应有的历史使命。
    为此，我们首先要在党内和广大人民中进行普遍及深入的宣传教育工作，使每个同志和广大人民都能深切认识美帝国主义是一百年来对中国人民最狡猾最阴险最凶恶的侵略者，目前正袭用着当年日寇先侵略朝鲜随后侵略中国的故技，直接危害我国安全。我们要想自救，必须救邻；要想保障国家建设，争取世界和平，必须抵抗暴行，制止侵略；一切关门自守侥幸偷安的麻痹思想，必须清除。我们要使每个同志和广大人民都能深切认识美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，也是全世界人民的死敌，它是极其孤立的，是外强中干脆弱腐朽的纸老虎；一切亲美的反动思想和恐美崇美的糊涂思想，必须清除。中国人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军并肩作战以来，转变了朝鲜战局，击溃了美军总攻，粉碎了侵略者狂妄的计划，这种事实叫人深切认识中国人民确能保卫祖国打败侵略；特别是中国站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中与全世界人民结成不可战胜的强大力量，必能彻底消灭帝国主义者的侵略，保卫全世界的持久和平；一切对中国人民和世界人民力量信心不足的动摇思想，必须清除。
    本党同志，不但要在抗美援朝保家卫国的持久斗争中提高自己，教育别人，还要把正确理解与坚强信心付诸行动，在广大人民及本党所联系的群众中积极地发挥骨干作用，为支援前线及一切志愿动员的工作而服务。要特别提高警惕，严防帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮进行阴谋破坏，或少数亲美分子混入阵营，损害我们抗美援朝的行动。要在中国共产党领导之下，与各民主党派本着共同纲领的立场，密切团结，齐一步骤，加强人民民主统一战线。要坚决拥护政府拥护军队，执行政令，协同政府巩固国防，保障公安，镇压匪特，完成土改，增加生产，稳定金融物价，巩固财经文教等建设；要在自己岗位上加紧工作完成任务，从各方面来巩固人民民主专政。凡关于巩固和发展党的组织；加强党的宣教等工作，都应与抗美援朝保家卫国运动相结合。
    本党二中全会适在我人民志愿部队英勇战斗胜利前进和全国人民展开轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动高潮中举行，特郑重决议，确定抗美援朝保家卫国为我们当前中心政治任务，号召全党同志，一致奋起，发扬爱国主义与国际主义的精神，与全国人民共同行动，为贯彻各民主党派联合宣言，完成这一重大的光荣任务而斗争！”
