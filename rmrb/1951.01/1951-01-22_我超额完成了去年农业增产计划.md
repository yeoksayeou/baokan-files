　　I Overfulfilled Last Year's Agricultural Production Increase Plan
　　Agricultural Labor Model Song Luoxue
　　Last year, I wrote my own production plan and sent it to Chairman Mao, making a guarantee. Over the past year, despite water disasters and insect plagues, although some individual items were not completed, overall, the predetermined production targets were not only achieved but also exceeded. This was accomplished with the direct assistance of the Party and the government at higher levels. In particular, after being selected as a county-level labor model, I also participated in the provincial economic conference and the national agricultural production conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. Following that, I was elected as a member of the county people's government. In October of last year, I attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, which enabled me to learn a lot of advanced production experiences and technologies. At the same time, I also understood that only through hard work, active production, and increased yields can the country become rich and strong, and the people can live a good life. Therefore, my confidence in production has been further enhanced and consolidated. Through a year of hard work, I increased grain production by 2,235 jin, exceeding the planned increase by 650 jin.
　　My family consists of six people: my wife, myself, and four children. We cultivate a total of 18.6 mu of land. Last spring, in response to the Party and government's call for increased grain and cotton production, I first convened a family meeting to determine the planting of 6 mu of cotton, 2 mu of Chinese yam, 1 mu of peanuts, and 4 mu each of millet and corn, with the remaining 0.6 mu planted with vegetables. This production plan, except for an increase of half a mu in yams and a decrease of half a mu in peanuts compared to the original plan, remained unchanged.
　　Diligent cultivation and abundant fertilization are the most important keys to ensuring the completion and exceeding of the production plan. I was determined to plow and harrow all the land three or four times, loosening the soil and retaining moisture. To apply more fertilizer, I used the money earned from working at the wood factory to buy soybean cakes and raised two piglets, accumulating over 160 cartloads of fertilizer. This created reliable conditions for increasing agricultural production. My 6 mu of cotton received an average of 5.5 cartloads of fertilizer per mu (usually 4 or 5 cartloads), plus 50 jin of sesame cake. It was hoed seven times (exceeding the usual two times) and pruned six times. Last year, when aphids and spider mites occurred in May and July respectively, I quickly sprayed pesticides, fortunately preventing a major disaster. However, cotton production had already decreased. Current statistics show an average yield of 100 jin per mu, a decrease of 60 jin per mu from the original plan. The 4 mu of millet were a bumper harvest. I selected plump Huanong No. 4 millet seeds and applied an average of 7 large cartloads of fertilizer per mu. When planting, I also used 30 jin of cottonseed cake and two loads of manure (50 jin per load) per mu, and hoed four times. As a result, the millet ears were long and plump. Although slightly affected by flooding, each mu still yielded 1 shi and 7 dou, an increase of 91 jin compared to the normal yield. The yield of yams was surprising. This was a yam variety I promoted after visiting the provincial farm. Our whole village planted this type of yam. My yams received 13 cartloads of fertilizer per mu and yielded 3,000 jin per mu, more than double the normal yield. The other 3 mu of corn averaged 1 shi and 3 dou per mu. The 6 mu of wheat yielded 9 dou per mu. The half mu of peanuts also yielded 200 jin. In total, last year my entire output could be exchanged for 5,620 jin of millet, an increase of 2,235 jin compared to the normal output of 3,385 jin, exceeding the planned increase by 650 jin. Without the insect and flood disasters, I believe the increase in production would have been much greater.
　　The production experience of the past year proves that: first, we must organize ourselves to improve labor efficiency and production volume, and to direct surplus labor towards sideline production. When I attended the provincial economic conference, I listened to Chairman Yang Xiufeng's report on the benefits of organizing. After returning home, I immediately publicized it to all Party members at the Party branch meeting and mobilized 16 households to form four work exchange groups. My household and Song Zhiyi's four households formed a group, and began mutual assistance production from April, with a total of 76 mu of land, six male laborers, four female laborers, and two donkeys. We saved 20 workdays in tasks such as hauling soil and manure, plowing, pulling wheat, and hauling wheat. During the wheat pulling, the four families had a total of 31 mu of wheat fields, and four people finished pulling in two days, averaging 4 mu per person per day. If working individually, each person could only pull 3 mu per day, saving two workdays per day. In addition, we helped each other in hauling soil, transporting manure, and sowing wheat, saving labor to engage in sideline production. Therefore, I was able to find time to sell a few batches of piglets, earning more than 1 shi of rice in a month. At the same time, I also participated in working at the village's wood factory, earning 2 shi and 9 dou of rice in five months. This fact made the masses realize the direction of getting organized and heading towards prosperity. During the wheat pulling period last year, I encouraged 223 out of 234 households in the village to participate in labor mutual assistance, laying a preliminary foundation for the development and improvement of mutual aid teams in the future.
　　Secondly, mastering agricultural technology and deeply studying the characteristics of crops is also very important. Over the past year, I have participated in various meetings, learned a lot of production knowledge, and applied this knowledge to practice. This has proved the importance of combining science with practice and the great power it can exert. For example, the characteristics of No. 2 Bisti cotton are sparse branches and leaves, extending in all directions, occupying a large area, and the seedlings should be sparsely planted. Therefore, when planting cotton, I paid attention to sowing in large ridges, so that the cotton plants were ventilated, and grew large and fertile. For example, in one mu of cotton field south of the village, which was less affected by disasters, each plant averaged 12 large cotton bolls, and 1,500 plants were planted per mu, yielding a total of 120 jin of seed cotton. However, in Luo Deshun's one mu of cotton field, which was next to mine, he planted in small ridges and crowded rows, without ventilation, the cotton seedlings grew weakly, with only seven or eight small bolls per plant, and the yield was relatively reduced.
　　Finally, selecting superior varieties is also very important. Last year, because the higher authorities designated our village as a high-quality cotton experimental area, I led the village's cotton technology team to first go to the provincial farm to collect No. 2 Bisti cotton seeds. Because the cotton seeds were not pure, we immediately led the masses of the whole village to carry out granular selection of 6,000 jin of cotton seeds before Grain Rain. However, after sowing, there was a sudden heavy rain, and the soil surface of the cotton field became stiff. Although the masses rushed to rake it, more than 120 mu of cotton seedlings did not emerge completely. In order to ensure the purity of the cotton seeds and not add a single hybrid, I went to the provincial farm again to get 132 jin of No. 2 Bisti cotton seeds, and completely replanted the missing seedlings. Therefore, the cotton quality was better last year than the year before. In order to ensure that all high-quality cotton seeds are planted this year, I also led the whole village to carry out field selection, marked the No. 2 Bisti cotton, and ensured separate harvesting, separate drying, and separate ginning.
　　The above is the production situation and experience of my past year. As for this year's production plan, I am currently drafting it. I guarantee that this year's production volume will increase compared to last year. The mutual aid team has decided to expand by a few more households, and widely publicize the role of getting organized, and lead the whole village to get organized, and strive to rapidly restore agricultural production.

　　我超额完成了去年农业增产计划
    农业劳动模范  宋洛学
    去年，我曾写好自己的生产计划，并寄给毛主席，提出保证。一年以来，经过水灾、虫灾，虽然其中个别项目有些没有完成，但总起来说，所预定的生产目标不但都已完成，而且还超过了。这是在上级党和政府的直接帮助下完成的。特别是我被选为全县劳动模范后，又先后参加了省经济会议和中央人民政府农业部召开的全国农业生产会议，跟着又被选为县人民政府委员，去年十月并出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，使我学习到很多先进的生产经验和生产技术。同时也明白了只有努力劳动，积极生产，增加产量，国家才能富强，人民才能过好光景。因此更加提高和巩固了我生产的信心。经过一年的努力，增产了粮食二千二百三十五斤，超过增产计划六百五十斤。
    我家共六口人，我和老婆和四个孩子，共种地十八亩六分。去春为响应党和政府的粮棉增产号召，我首先召开了家庭会议，确定种二比棉六亩，洋山药二亩，花生一亩，谷子及玉米各种四亩，此外剩六分地种了菜蔬。这个生产计划，后来除山药较原计划增加半亩，花生减少半亩外，其他都没有变动。
    勤耕种，多施肥，是保证完成并超过生产计划最重要的关键。我决心将全部土地耕三耙四，松动土质，保存水分。为了多施肥，我把参加木厂做工赚的钱买豆饼，养了两个小猪；积肥达一百六十车之多。这就替农业增产创造了可靠的条件。我种的六亩棉花，平均每亩上肥五车半（常年上四车或五车），又上麻饼五十斤；锄了七遍（超过常年两遍），整枝六遍；去年五月、七月先后发生蚜虫和火蜘蛛时，我又很快喷了药水，幸而没有成为重灾，但棉花已经减产了，现在统计平均每亩产一百市斤，比原计划每亩减少六十斤。四亩谷子是丰收的。我曾选了肥大的华农四号谷种，每亩又平均施肥七大车，种时每亩又使用了三十斤棉籽仁饼和两挑大粪（每挑五十斤）；锄了四遍。所以谷子的穗头长而肥；虽然受了点涝灾，每亩也产一石七市斗，较常年产量增加九十一斤。山药的产量使人惊奇。这是我去省农场参观后，回来推广的山药品种，我们全村都种了这种山药。我种的山药每亩施肥十三车，每亩产了三千斤，较常年产量超过一倍以上。其他三亩玉米平均每亩也产一石三斗。六亩麦子每亩收九斗。半亩花生也产二百斤。总计去年一年我的全部产量，可换小米五千六百二十斤，比常年产量三千三百八十五斤增加了二千二百三十五斤。超过了增产计划六百五十斤。如果没有虫、涝灾，我相信增产的数量会大得多。
    一年来生产的经验证明：首先必须组织起来，才能提高劳动效率和生产量；也才能将剩余劳动力投向副业生产去。我参加省里经济会议时，听了杨秀峰主席报告关于组织起来的好处，回家后我即在党的支部会上向全体党员作了宣传；并动员了十六户组成四个拨工组。我和宋志宜四户组织一组，从四月即开始互助生产，共有土地七十六亩，男劳动力六个，女劳动力四个，驴两头。在拉土送粪、耕地、拔麦、拉麦等工作中省了二十个工。在拔麦时四家共有三十一亩麦田，四个人两天就拔完了；合每人每天拔四亩，如果单干每人每天只能拔三亩，每日省工两个。此外拉土、运粪耩麦都互助合作，省出劳动力去搞副业生产。因此，我有可能抽空贩卖了几趟小猪，一个月赚了一石多米。同时还参加了本村木厂作工，五个月赚米二石九斗。这个事实使群众认清了组织起来走向富裕的方向。在去年拔麦期间，我鼓动了全村二百三十四户中有二百二十三户参加了劳动互助，给今后互助组的发展和提高初步打下了基础。
    其次，掌握农业技术，深入实际研究作物的特性也很重要。一年来我参加各种会议，学了很多生产知识，并将这些知识应用到实际中去。证明了科学与实际结合的重要性和它发挥力量的宏大作用。譬如二比斯字棉的特点是枝叶稀疏，向四面伸张，占面积大，留苗宜稀。因此，我在种棉时注意耩大垅，这样棉花透风，长得棵大枝肥。如村南受灾较轻的一亩棉田，每棵平均结十二个大桃，每亩种植一千五百棵，共摘籽棉一百二十斤。但紧挨着我这块地，罗得顺家的一亩棉田，他种得垅小行挤，不透风，棉苗长得孱弱，每棵只结了七、八个小桃，产量相对减少。
    最后，选择优良品种也很重要。去年由于上级确定我村是良棉试验区，我就领导本村棉花技术小组，首先去省农场领回二比斯字棉籽；由于棉籽不纯，我们即领导全村群众在谷雨前将六千斤棉籽进行了粒选。但播种后，突然下了一场大雨，棉田地皮僵硬，虽经群众抢扒仍有一百二十多亩棉苗未出齐全。为保证棉籽纯洁不补一粒杂种，我又去省农场取来一百三十二斤二比斯字棉籽，全部补好缺苗。因此去年棉质比前年为好。为保证今年全部种植优良棉种，我又领导全村进行田间选种，将二比棉插了标记；并作到了单收、单晒、单轧。
    以上是我去年一年生产的情况和经验，至于今年生产计划，目前我正在拟定中，我保证今年的生产量比去年还要增加。互助组已决定再行扩大几户，并广泛宣传组织起来的作用，领导全村组织起来，为迅速恢复农业生产而努力。
