　　Certain State-Owned Specialized Companies in Handan
　  Have Not Seriously Implemented the Trade Union Law
    Certain administrative leaders of state-owned specialized companies in Handan, Hebei, do not value trade union work and treat trade unions with an incorrect attitude, so that the "Trade Union Law" cannot be well implemented. The following are a few actual examples: (1) The Grain Company illegally transferred Zhai Jiujiang, the chairman of the trade union, in September last year, causing the trade union to collapse. After the staff raised their opinions, the administration stated: "I have not read the Trade Union Law and do not know the procedures. We should be vigilant about this in the future." In December, the administration decided to dismiss trainee Yang Sanlu because he was ill and his mind was not clear. The trade union did not agree, so he was not dismissed. Later, it was proposed to dismiss storekeeper Ye Tongri. The trade union advocated clarifying the situation before making a decision. Therefore, the administration believed that the trade union was "unreasonable." Han, the chief of the personnel department, said: "With a trade union, the administration does not even have the right to dismiss people." After that, they became prejudiced against the trade union, causing the trade union cadres to feel depressed and unwilling to do trade union work. (2) Zhao Enpu, the manager of the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, wanted to dismiss trainee Li Changfu for some reason. Because it was not decided by an administrative meeting, it caused dissatisfaction among other section chiefs. The trade union also raised objections and proposed a meeting to study the matter. At the meeting, Manager Zhao lost his temper and said: "Your trade union manages everything, monopolizing the administration." The chairman of the trade union took out the Trade Union Law to explain to him, and he realized that the trade union must be notified before dismissing workers. In addition, the company's administrative负责人 often does not attend trade union group meetings. The company's trade union requested to participate in administrative meetings according to the Trade Union Law, made verbal requests several times, and also wrote written opinions, but it has not been resolved for more than a month. (3) Last year, it was stipulated that there would be a three-day holiday for National Day. If the holiday could not be taken due to busy work, double pay would be given. The Grain and Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Companies did not give holidays and paid double pay, but now they are asking employees to return the money. No one pays attention to the opinions raised by the trade union.
    The reason for these situations is that the administration's idea of relying on employees is not clear. They do not understand the importance of trade union work, and do not understand the Trade Union Law. Therefore, I suggest that the administrative cadres of each specialized company in Handan can study the Trade Union Law well. And I hope that other relevant departments should also lead and arrange the study of the Trade Union Law.

　　邯郸某些国营专业公司
　  尚未认真执行工会法
    河北邯郸某些国营专业公司的行政领导干部，不重视工会工作，以不正确的态度对待工会，使《工会法》不能很好的贯彻。下面就是几个实际事例：（一）粮食公司在去年九月份非法调走工会主席翟九江，使工会垮了台。职工们提意见后，行政上才表示：“没有看过工会法，不知道手续，以后应该警惕这事。”十二月份行政决定开除练习生杨三禄。因为他有病，脑子不清楚。工会不同意，算没有被开除。后又提出开除保管员叶同日。工会主张了解清楚后再决定。因此行政认为工会“没道理”。人事科韩科长说：“有了工会，行政连开除人的权利也没有了。”之后，对工会就抱成见，使工会干部情绪低落，不愿作工会工作。（二）花纱布公司经理赵恩普因故要开除练习生李昌福。因没有经行政会议决定，引起其他科长不满。工会也提出反对意见，提议开会研究。开会时赵经理发脾气说：“你们工会啥也管，包办了行政。”工会主席拿出工会法向他解释，他才知道开除工人必须通知工会。此外公司的行政负责人经常不参加工会小组会。该公司工会根据工会法要求参加行政会议，口头要求了几次，又写了书面意见，到现在已一个多月，还没有解决。（三）去年国庆节规定放假三天，如因工作忙不能放假则发双薪。粮食、花纱布公司没放假，发了双薪，但现在又要职工退钱。工会提意见也没人理。
    产生这些情况的原因是行政依靠职工的思想不明确。不懂得工会工作的重要，不了解工会法，因此，我建议邯郸各专业公司行政干部能很好的学习一下工会法。并希望其他有关部门也应该领导和布置对工会法的学习。
