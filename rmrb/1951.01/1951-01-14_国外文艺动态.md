　　Soviet Writers' Creative Plans for 1951
　　As the new year begins, Soviet writers have been establishing their creative plans for 1951. According to "Literary Gazette," Fedin will continue to write a novel about events in the central provinces during the Great Patriotic War. It is the third part of the continuous novels "Early Joys" and "Unusual Summer." Pavlenko plans to write a novel about the peace movement, mainly narrating the struggle of foreign people for peace. He said: "There is nothing more difficult than writing about foreigners, foreign cities, and foreign life." Leonov is also preparing to write a novel about forests. Lavrenev will write two plays: one about Lermontov, to be completed in March, to be staged on the occasion of the 110th anniversary of the poet's death. The second play, "Legacy," depicts a Soviet family. Kataev hopes to write a novel about one of the giant construction projects in Stalin's Five-Year Plan. Inber wants to revise her long poem "Waterway." Panova said that she began writing a novel last year and needs another year and a half to complete it. It narrates the life of a small Soviet city over three years, how a child who lost his parents during the war finds his new family, and later participates in the election for the first time on December 17, 1950. Polevoy will write a novella about industrial construction. The poet Marshak plans to write a novel for children called "Happy Journey" in the new year, and will continue to write lyrical poems and engage in translation work. Mikhalkov has already started writing a play about peace advocates. The story takes place in a working-class family in a British city, and the protagonist is a fifteen-year-old student who collects signatures for peace. He also plans to write two cheerful collections of poems for children and create a play for the youngest children.
　　Reactionary Writers Selling Confessions
　　In addition to producing obscene, and murder-inciting works full of toxins, reactionary writers in Britain and America often utter shameless anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric to exchange for the blood-stained money awarded to them by monopoly capitalists. Some fallen literary figures who claim to have been "left-wingers" or "communists" in the past specialize in using "confessions" to curry favor with imperialists. They published a collection entitled "The God That Failed" to flaunt their own festering sores. Among them is Ignazio Silone, who once wrote "The Pulse of Italy," who shamelessly confessed that a disappointed "communist" can transform into a "fascist." Stephen Spender, a poet who once gained some fame in the British literary world, openly wrote articles in the New York "Times" asking the American government to issue him a special passport because he "had been in the British Communist Party for a few days and therefore knew the inside story of the British Communist Party." Arthur Koestler, who promotes mysticism, boasted of his servility to imperialism: "We who have left the Communist Party are the most loyal members standing on your side."
　　In capitalist countries, on the one hand, degenerate writers are rushing to publish articles confessing their past works and advocating for new wars; on the other hand, staunch and unyielding progressive writers like H. Fast, J.H. Lawson, D.Trumbo, and A.B.Maltz, although imprisoned, still persist in fighting.

　　国外文艺动态
    苏联作家一九五一年的创作计划
    苏联的作家们在新的一年开始的时候，纷纷订立了自己的一九五一年的创作计划。根据“文学报”所载，费丁将继续写小说，内容是卫国战争时期发生在中部各省的事情。它是“初欢”和“不平凡的夏天”两部连续小说的第三部。巴甫连柯计划写关于保卫和平运动的小说，主要是叙述外国人民争取和平的斗争。他说：“再没有比写外国人，外国的城市和外国的生活更困难的了。”列奥诺夫也准备写一部小说，是关于森林的。拉甫列涅夫将写两个剧本：一个是写莱蒙托夫的，于三月间完成，以便在纪念诗人逝世一百一十周年时上演。第二个剧本为“遗产”，描写一个苏联家庭。卡达耶夫希望写一部关于斯大林五年计划中巨大建设事业之一的小说。英倍尔要修改她的长诗“水路”。潘诺娃说，她已于去年开始写一部小说，再需要一年半的时间来完成它。它叙述一个历时三年的苏维埃小城的生活，一个在战争期间失去父母的小孩，怎样找到自己的新的家庭，后来在一九五○年十二月十七日第一次参加了选举。波列伏依将写一个中篇小说，是关于工业建设的。诗人马尔夏克在新的一年中，准备写一本给孩子们看的小说“愉快的旅行”，此外仍继续写抒情诗以及从事翻译工作。米哈尔科夫已经开始在写一部关于和平拥护者的剧本。故事发生在某英国城市的一个工人家庭中，主人公是一个征集和平签名的十五岁的小学生。他还打算给儿童写两本愉快的诗集，并为最小的孩子创作一个剧本。
    出售忏悔书的反动作家
    英美反动作家除了制造诲淫诲盗，教唆谋杀，种种充满毒素的作品外，还常常发出反苏反共的无耻论调来换取独占资本家赏给他们的血污的金钱。一些自命为过去是“左翼分子”或“共产主义者”的堕落文氓更专门以“忏悔书”来向帝国主义者邀宠。他们出版了一本题名为“失败了的上帝”的集子，来抓弄自己的脓疮毒疽。其中有曾经写过“意大利的脉搏”的伊格那齐亚·西隆（Ignazio Silone），他恬不知耻地招供说：失望了的“共产主义者”可以一变而为“法西斯主义者”。那曾经在英国文坛上出过一些名的诗人斯丹芬·斯班特（Stephen Spender）公开在纽约“时报”上撰文，要求美国政府对他发给特别护照，因为他“曾经在英国共产党里待过几天，因此知道英国共产党的内幕”。那个宣传神秘主义的亚瑟·科斯勒（Arthur Koestler）向帝国主义夸耀他的奴性：“我们退出共产党的人是站在你们这边的最忠实的分子。”
    在资本主义国家内，一方面是堕落的文氓争先恐后地发表文章忏悔他们过去自己所写的作品，鼓吹新战争；另一方面是坚贞不屈的进步作家像法斯特（H.Fast）、劳森（J.H.Lawson）、托伦波（D.Truumbo）玛尔兹（A.B.Maltz）虽然被投入牢狱，却依旧坚持战斗。
