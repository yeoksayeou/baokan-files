　　To the Editor:
    The Tianjin Railway Bureau's Beijing Detachment experienced twenty-four cases of passenger injuries and deaths last year due to jumping from or climbing onto trains. Among those jumping from trains, soldiers and railway employees were the most numerous. The reasons for soldiers jumping from trains were mostly due to insufficient awareness of the dangers involved. Some, in order to avoid being far from their unit's location after the train arrived at the station, risked jumping off the train mid-route. Railway employees generally believed they had the skills to jump or climb onto trains due to their years of experience in the railway industry. Of course, these were all due to our security escort team's insufficient publicity and education towards passengers. At the same time, the public security officers themselves lacked a strong sense of responsibility, were negligent in their escort work, and failed to fulfill their duty to protect passengers. These are all worth our deep self-examination and diligent improvement.

    In addition, twenty-four cases of prisoners escaping by jumping from trains due to the carelessness of their escorts occurred last year. For example, on December 15th of last year, while train 151 was traveling near Datong, Dong Zhijin and Zhou Xuan of the People's Court of Chahar Province were escorting a drug addict back to Gui Sui. Due to a lack of vigilance, the prisoner jumped from the train and escaped. On April 15th of last year, on train 106 from Beijing to Tianjin, Lu Wenxiang and another person from the Wuqing County Public Security Bureau were escorting a prisoner from Tianjin to Yangcun. As a result, the prisoner used the excuse of going to the toilet and jumped from the train to escape. Some prisoners were dressed the same as their escorts and were not bound; after boarding, they did not contact the public security officers of the escort team, so assistance in prevention could not be provided in a timely manner. In the future, we hope that local public security and judicial organs can contact us more when escorting prisoners. In this way, on the one hand, the escort mission can be successfully completed, and on the other hand, train jumping accidents can be prevented.
                          Wang Hui, Head of the Beijing Escort Team of the Tianjin Railway Bureau

### 天津铁路局北京分局护车队长要求防止发生跳车事故

　　天津铁路局北京分局护车队长要求防止发生跳车事故编辑同志：
    天津铁路管理局北京分局去年发生旅客因跳车、爬车的伤亡事故达二十四起，其中跳车的以军人和铁路职工为最多。军人跳车的原因，多为对跳车之危险性认识不足，有的为避免车到站后离部队驻地较远，因此不惜冒险在中途跳车；铁路职工一般则自恃吃铁路饭多年，对跳车、爬车有技术。当然，这些都是由于我们护车队对旅客宣传教育不够，同时公安员本身责任心不强，在护车工作上麻痹大意、没有尽到保护旅客的责任所致。这些都值得我们深刻检讨和努力改进。
    此外，去年一年中还发生犯人因解押人的粗心大意，乘隙跳车潜逃事件达二十四起。如去年十二月十五日一五一次车行驶至大同附近时，有察哈尔省人民法院董智谨、周轩两人，押解一吸毒犯在归绥。因疏于防范，结果犯人跳车逃跑了。去年四月十五日京津一○六次车上，有武清县公安局陆文祥等二人由天津押解一犯人往杨村，结果犯人借口上厕所，跳车逃跑了。有的犯人身上服装和押解人一样，而且不捆绑；上车后也不和护车队公安员联系，以致不能及时协助防备。今后希望各地公安、司法机关，在解押犯人时能多和我们联系，这样，一方面使解押任务能顺利完成，一方面可杜绝跳车事故。
