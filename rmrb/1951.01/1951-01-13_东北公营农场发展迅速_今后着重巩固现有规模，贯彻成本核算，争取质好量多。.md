　　Northeast State-Owned Farms Develop Rapidly
    Focus on consolidating existing scale, implementing cost accounting, and striving for high quality and quantity in the future.
    [Our Newspaper] Northeast state-owned farms have developed greatly in recent years with the aim of "accumulating experience and training cadres." There are now 320 state-owned farms in Northeast China, including 40 mechanized farms, with a total land area of 179,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare), equivalent to just over 1% of the total cultivated land area in Northeast China. They have 547 tractors, 20,980 employees, and have trained more than 1,400 tractor drivers. Basic construction such as farm buildings and employee dormitories have been built. For example, Tongbei Farm has a construction area of 10,000 square meters. Each farm is also initially equipped with warehouses, machine depots, and oil depots, and some farms also have larger repair shops. In terms of employee welfare, major farms have facilities such as clubs and health clinics. Employees have also organized cooperatives.
    Thanks to the active efforts of all farm employees in Northeast China over the past year, great achievements have been made in all aspects. For example, the operation technology of mechanized farms has improved, research can now be linked to operations, deep plowing has been generally emphasized in land reclamation, "combines" have been used for harvesting, a preliminary economic accounting system has been established, fuel consumption has gradually decreased, and soybean losses during harvesting have been reduced to 12%, and wheat losses to 1.2%. It is estimated that the grain harvest in 1950 will be over 15,000 tons, with an average wheat yield of 1,600 jin per hectare and soybean yield of 1,700 jin per hectare. Animal-powered farms have begun to have confidence in the use of new farm tools. This year, the county farms have cultivated and propagated approximately 4,000 tons of improved varieties.
    However, the common shortcomings of all farms at present are: high costs, low quality, and large waste. For example, the cost of wheat per hectare is as high as 7 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below), far from the required 5.4 million yuan; fuel waste, according to calculations by the "August 15th" Farm, resulted in a loss of over 170 million yuan. In order to summarize past experiences, improve the work of the farms, and further determine future directions and policies, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government convened a meeting of state-owned farm managers on December 16th of last year.
    At the conclusion of the meeting, Zhang Kecheng, Deputy Minister of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government, made a summary. Deputy Minister Zhang emphasized that: first of all, it is necessary to clarify the "profitable production" policy (because past production was unprofitable or at a loss), using a certain number of personnel and agricultural machinery to cultivate a certain area of ​​land, and managing it with cost accounting methods, to achieve high yield and high quality (of course, it is also necessary to accumulate experience and train cadres). Animal-powered farms should mainly breed improved varieties, and play a demonstration and promotion role in agricultural technology, influencing farmers. In order to achieve the above requirements, it was decided that all farms must be standardized in 1951, and generally no further development will be carried out, focusing on consolidating the existing scale, ensuring that all existing land can be planted and planted well; implement cost accounting to achieve planned costs, requiring basic realization according to the plan, accumulating experience, and training cadres; the working method should focus on the center, solve the major problems that need to be solved urgently, the work style should be meticulous, requiring constant improvement, and more consideration of new problems; continue to improve technology, cultivate intensively and meticulously, do our best to eliminate weeds, ensure no accidents, be familiar with improving connected operations, use rollers, and maximize machine efficiency. The animal-powered farms in each county should also be standardized to further purify and improve the existing improved varieties.

　　东北公营农场发展迅速
    今后着重巩固现有规模，贯彻成本核算，争取质好量多。
    【本报讯】东北公营农场，几年来在“积累经验培养干部”的目的下，已经有了很大发展。全东北公营农场已有三百二十个，其中机械农场四十个，共拥有土地十七万九千垧（每垧十五市亩），等于全东北耕地面积百分之一强。有拖拉机五百四十七台，员工二万零九百八十人，培养出拖拉机驾驶员一千四百余人。农场场房员工宿舍等基本建设已经修建起来。如通北农场已有一万平方米的建设面积。各场也初步地具备了仓库、机器库、油库，有的农场还有较大的修理所。员工福利方面，主要农场都有俱乐部、卫生所等设备。职工们又组织起了合作社。
    一年来在全东北农场员工的积极努力下，各方面都有了很大收获。如机械农场作业技术已有提高，研究能够连结作业，开荒普遍注意到深耕，收割时都使用了“康拜因”，初步建立了经济核算制，油料消耗已逐渐降低，收获时大豆的损失已减少到百分之十二，小麦减少到百分之一·二。估计一九五○年谷物收获量约在一万五千吨以上，小麦每垧平均产量达一千六百斤，大豆一千七百斤。畜力农场对使用新式农具已开始有了信心，今年由县农场培育繁殖出来的优良品种约有四千吨。
    但是，目前各农场有着共同的缺点是：成本高、质量低、浪费大。如小麦每垧成本高达七百万元（东北币，下同），距五百四十万元的要求相差很远；油料浪费，据“八一五”农场计算即损失了一亿七千多万元。东北人民政府农林部，为了总结过去经验，改进各农场工作，并进一步确定今后的方针和政策，于去年十二月十六日召开了公营农场场长会议。
    在会议结束时，东北人民政府农林部张克成副部长作了总结。张副部长着重指出：首先要明确“生产有利”方针（因为过去生产无利或赔钱），用一定的人员农机具，耕种一定面积的土地，以成本核算方法经营管理，达到产量高质量好（当然还要积累经验，培养干部）。畜力农场主要是繁殖优良品种，在农作技术上做到示范推广作用，影响农民。为了达到上述要求，因此一九五一年确定所有农场必须定型，一般的不再发展，以巩固现有为主，把现有土地都能种上而且种好；贯彻成本核算，达到计划成本，要求基本能按计划实现，积累经验，培养干部；工作方法上要抓住中心，解决当前急需解决的主要问题，工作作风要细致，要求日新月异，对新问题多加思考；继续提高技术，精耕细作，尽全力消灭杂草，保证不出事故，熟悉改进连结作业，使用镇压器，发挥机器最大效能。各县畜力农场也要定型，把现有优良品种更加纯化，提高一步。
