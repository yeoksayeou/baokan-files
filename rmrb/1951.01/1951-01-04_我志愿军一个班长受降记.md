Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: This agency's correspondent with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army reports: The American invading forces, who had the good fortune to escape from the encirclement in the Changjin Lake area, truly resembled a pack of stray dogs. When they encountered the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's intercepting troops, some of them hurriedly surrendered. The following is an account by Jiang Ruilin, a communication squad leader of a certain battalion of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, of accepting the surrender:

　　On the evening of November 30th, our unit caught up with a group of American soldiers fleeing from Gutuli towards Gan Cikai. The enemy had more than four hundred men, along with seventy-five cars and tanks. After several fierce attacks by our forces, blocking them from the front and flanking them from the rear, the cars were set on fire, the tank driver of the first tank slipped away, and many American soldiers huddled under the cars. Only a portion of the enemy still tried to resist, relying on the tanks and cars. After fighting for half the night, the enemy realized there was no hope of escape. At this time, we found an American officer among the prisoners who could speak a few words of Chinese, and we told him to shout a message. He did, and sure enough, the enemy's position became quiet. After a while, a jeep drove up, and four American soldiers stepped out with two carbine rifles. I gestured for them to put down their weapons, and they immediately did so. As it happened, one of these four men was an officer of the Li bandit army, and he became the translator for this surrender negotiation. Our battalion political instructor wrote eight characters on paper: "Lay down your arms and you will not be killed, prisoners will be treated leniently," and told them to order their soldiers to surrender.

　　The negotiation proceeded through a combination of written communication and gestures. The enemy made four requests: first, not to kill them; second, to release them in the future; third, to give them rest and sleep; and fourth, to allow them to write letters home. We said we could agree, as long as they immediately laid down their weapons. However, they wanted to delay the surrender until six thirty. We said no, and set a deadline of half an hour for them to lay down their arms.

　　Half an hour passed, and there was no response from the enemy position. Of course, we opened fire fiercely. The enemy saw that they could not delay, and two more officers came to ask us to send a representative to accept the surrender. I requested permission from my superiors to go, and they agreed. I prepared my weapons, guarding against any treachery.

　　The American soldiers originally wore bitter expressions, but when they saw me coming, it was as if their surrender was guaranteed, and they were all very happy. At this time, everything was in chaos. The cars were parked haphazardly, and no one was fully armed. Many people had put their guns aside and were looking for their belongings. The wounded were crying out, but no one paid attention. As soon as a shot was fired, the American soldiers would hug their heads and crawl into the ditches.

　　The two officers followed my instructions, leading me from the middle to the north end, and then from the north end to the south end. I saw a group of American soldiers still carrying guns on their shoulders, and I gestured for them to put down their weapons, then pointed in a direction, telling them to walk towards our position. I saw some still digging fortifications, so I picked up a shovel and waved it. The American officer saw this, murmured something to the soldiers next to him, and after that, there was no more sound of shovels.

　　After circling the enemy's position, I returned to my own unit. Immediately afterwards, American soldiers came in droves to surrender. Among them was a group of nearly twenty American soldiers who walked over in formation, like they were on parade. Each of them hunched their heads and raised their hands, with an empty holster hanging on their chest. As soon as we said a word or shook our guns, they would quickly pat their empty holsters together, indicating that they had disarmed. Our soldiers laughed and said, "The American soldiers' surrender movements are all trained!"

　　我志愿军一个班长受降记
    【新华社三日讯】本社随中国人民志愿军通讯员报道：从长津湖地区包围圈中侥幸逃出去的美国侵略军，真像一群丧家之犬，碰上中国人民志愿军的拦击部队，有些就慌慌忙忙地缴枪投降。下面是我国人民志愿军某营通讯班长江瑞林口述受降的经过：
    十一月三十日晚上，我们队伍赶上了一群从古土里逃到干磁开去的美国兵。敌人有四百多，还有七十五辆汽车和坦克。这群敌人被我们前堵后插几阵猛扑后，汽车灭了火，第一辆坦克的坦克手溜跑了，许多美国兵都挤到汽车底下去，只有一部分敌人还想凭借坦克、汽车顽抗。打了半夜，敌人眼看是无望逃跑了。这时我们从俘虏中找到一个会讲几句中国话的美国军官，叫他喊话，他就喊起来了。果然，敌人阵地就平静下来。过了一会儿，开来一辆吉普车，四个美国兵带着两支卡宾枪走下车来。我做手势，叫他们放下武器，他们马上把枪放下来。刚好这四个人当中有一个是李匪军军官，他就成了这个受降谈判的翻译员。我们的营教导员在纸上写了“缴枪不杀，宽待俘虏”八个字，要他们命令士兵们投降。
    谈判在一边笔谈一边做手势中进行。敌人提出四项要求：一、不杀他们；二、将来释放他们；三、给他们休息睡觉；四、给他们写信回家。我们说可以，只要马上放下武器就行。但是，他们想拖延到六点半才投降。我们说不行，并限定他们在半小时内放下武器。
    半点钟过去了，敌人阵地没有回音。我们当然猛烈开火。敌人看到没法拖延，又来了两个军官请我们派代表受降。我向上级要求让我去，上级答应了。我准备好武器，提防他们捣鬼。
    那些美国兵本来都是一副苦脸，看见我一去，好像投降有了保证，都十分高兴。这时，到处都很混乱，汽车横七竖八地停着，没有一个人是全副武装的。许多人都把枪放在一边，寻自己东西去了。伤兵在叫唤也没有人理会。只要有一下枪响，美国兵就抱着头往沟里钻。
    那两个军官听从我的指挥，领着我从中间走到北头，又从北头走到南头。我看到了一批美国兵肩上还挂着枪，我就做手势，叫他们放下武器，又指了个方向，叫他们向我们阵地走。我看到有些还在挖工事，我就随手拿起一把洋锹，摆摆手。美国军官见了，向旁边士兵咕噜一阵，以后就没有铁锹声了。
    在敌人阵地上兜了一个圈子，我就回到自己的队伍来。紧跟着，美国兵就成群结队的一批批前来投降。其中有一群美国兵，将近二十个人，走过来时的动作像出操一样整齐，个个人都紧缩着头，举起双手，胸前挂着一个空枪套。只要我们讲一句话或摇动一下枪，他们就急忙一齐拍拍空枪套，表示已经解除武装了。我们的战士都笑着说：“美国兵的投降动作都是受过训练的呢！”
