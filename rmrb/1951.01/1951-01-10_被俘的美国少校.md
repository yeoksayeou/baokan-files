　　Captured American Major
    Fan Zhen
    The tall American major—this prisoner of war just brought back from the front—John C. Harlan, was brought into a small thatched cottage. His body, bearing three minor wounds, trembled incessantly as he sat on the kang (platform bed). A beard grown for half a month almost covered his entire gaunt face, revealing only two large eyes, dimly and feebly flickering.
    "You must speak frankly."
    "Yes, I know."
    He began to recount how he was captured. In late November, when they were advancing arrogantly into the mountainous area of ​​northern Korea, they encountered a powerful counterattack from the Chinese and Korean People's forces. Just as they were about to turn and flee, their escape route was cut off. From December 1st, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army thrust at the enemy like countless sharp knives. The enemy panicked and abandoned tanks, vehicles, light and heavy weapons, and a large amount of other supplies, fleeing in a hurry, ultimately to be annihilated in groups. On the morning of the 2nd, in a certain place in Anju, this American major surrendered. As he said this, he stretched out his hands, revealing a helpless, mock-comical expression.
    He was the Executive Officer of the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Regiment of the US 2nd Division (responsible for the administrative work of the entire battalion except for military command), but he said that he did not bear any actual responsibility.
    At this time, it was necessary to first explain our policy towards prisoners of war, so he was told: "We give preferential treatment to prisoners of war, this is our policy. We will never kill enemies who lay down their weapons."
    "I already knew that three days ago. You give me food, give me water, give me cigarettes, treat my wounds, let me write letters home… it’s really too good!"
    "Who do you have at home?"
    "A wife, a fifteen-year-old son, and a thirteen-year-old daughter."
    "Do you miss your home?"
    "Very much! Very much…!"
    "After a while, you can go back!"
    "That will be the happiest day!"
    The dim and weak eyes of this 45-year-old American major immediately flashed with a gleam of surprise.
    He cannot be regarded as an ordinary American soldier. Before enlisting, he graduated from Harvard and Cornell Universities, worked as a middle school history teacher for more than ten years, enlisted after the outbreak of the Pacific War, participated in the war against Japan in the Philippines, and has worked in the military for eight years.
    "Don't fight anymore, I want peace, I want to go home!" The situation of his family stirred up his homesickness, and his words were filled with infinite emotion.
    "Then why do you serve in your army?"
    "My government forced me."
    "What do you know about China?"
    "China is a country friendly to the Soviet Union, the leader of China is Mao Zedong, and the Chinese people are civilized." That's all.
    We explained to him in detail that the Chinese people are voluntarily assisting neighboring Korea in resisting American aggression in order to protect world peace and their own fruits of victory. But he said:
    "But the United States and China have always been friendly."
    We told him: "It should be said that the American people and the Chinese people have always been friendly; the American government—the American imperialists—are forever the enemy of the Chinese people. Do you know that your planes have constantly flown into China's airspace to conduct reconnaissance, strafing, and bombing?"
    "That may be an accidental misunderstanding."
    "It's strange, in the coastal area of ​​Shandong, China, and on the Sino-Korean border in the Northeast, American planes are constantly conducting reconnaissance, bombing, and strafing. According to incomplete statistics in early November, there were as many as 88 times in three months in the Sino-Korean border area alone. Is this accidental?"
    In his mind, right and wrong, black and white, have always been reversed and confused. The education he received could only be such ignorance and stupidity. How could he know these things? So he was speechless.
    After the conversation, the prisoner of war—the American major—was being escorted to another place, and I walked with him. He hunched over, leaning on a wooden stick, moving his steps with difficulty. I said, "If you hadn't been a soldier and hadn't come to Korea, how happy you would be at this time!" This American major, who was once so arrogant and domineering, continued to walk laboriously in silence, hanging his head, feeling sadness? Regret? Or something else? He knew it himself.
    Suddenly, four American planes flew over and frantically took turns diving and strafing in the nearby gully, frightening the American major and causing him to fall to the side of the road to take cover. As we continued to move forward, I said:
    "We hate your planes so much!"
    He suddenly turned his face, glared at me with both eyes, and said with infinite certainty:
    "I hate them just as much!"
    This captured American major lives at 1701 Coroline Street, Balteimore City, Maryland, USA. On December 18th, he sent his second letter after being captured to his beloved wife, Mildred.T.Harlan. The letter said:
    "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is very kind to me. They share food and cigarettes with me, and give me medical help as much as possible. I will soon be transferred to a prisoner of war camp and be with other prisoners. I may be released in the future.
    It is very cold here.
    Take care of yourself and the children, and pray for lasting peace and a safe return home for me."
    Let the American soldiers and their families who have been driven by the Wall Street bosses to the cold Korean battlefield know that anyone who bravely lays down their arms to the Chinese and Korean People's forces will receive the same preferential treatment.

### 被俘的美国少校

　　被俘的美国少校
    樊震
    身材高大的美国少校——这个刚从前方带回的俘虏——约翰·Ｃ·哈兰（John  C.Harlan），被带到一间矮小的草房里，带着三处微伤的身躯，颤动不停地坐在炕上。半个月没有刮的胡子，几乎占满了他整个消瘦的面孔，只露着两只大眼睛，昏黯而无力地闪动着。
    “你要坦白地讲。”
    “是的，我知道。”
    他开始叙述着被俘的经过了。十一月底，当他们正趾高气扬地向朝鲜北部山地推进时，遇到了中朝人民部队的强大反击，刚要转身逃命，逃路又被截断了。就从十二月一日起，我人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军像无数尖刀向敌人插去，敌人慌得丢掉了坦克、汽车、轻重武器及其他大量的物资仓惶逃命，最后则是一股一股地遭到消灭。二日早晨，在新安州某地，这个美国少校就俯首就俘了。他说到这里，两手一伸，现出无可奈何的、故作滑稽的神情。
    他是美第二师第九团第三营的行政官（Executive  officer，负责全营除军事指挥外的行政工作），但是他说他是并不负什么实际责任的。
    这时，首先解释我们的俘虏政策是必要的，就向他说：“我们优待俘虏，这是我们的政策，对于放下武器的敌人，我们决不杀害。”
    “三天前我已经知道了，你们给我饭吃，给我水喝，给我烟抽，给我治伤，让我写家信……实在太好了！”
    “你家里有什么人？”
    “妻子，十五岁的儿子和一个十三岁的姑娘。”
    “你想家吗？”
    “非常想！非常想……”！
    “过一个时期你就可以回去了！”
    “那将是最快乐的日子！”
    这位四十五岁的美国少校的黯淡无力的眼睛里，立时闪出了一道惊喜的亮光。
    并不能把他看作一个普通的美国士兵。他入伍前曾毕业于哈佛及康乃尔大学，当了十几年的中学历史教员，太平洋战争爆发后入伍，在菲律宾曾参加对日作战，在军中工作已八年了。
    “别再打了，我要和平，我希望回家！”家庭的情况勾起了他的乡愁，话语间带着无限的感慨。
    “那么你为什么要在你们军队中服务呢？”
    “我的政府强迫我。”
    “关于中国你知道些什么？”
    “中国是和苏联友好的国家，中国的领袖是毛泽东，中国人民是文明的。”仅此而已。
    我们向他详细地解释了中国人民是为了保护世界的和平和自己的胜利果实，才志愿援助邻居朝鲜反抗美国的侵略。但是他说：
    “但是美国和中国是一向友好的。”
    我们告诉他：“应该这样说：美国人民和中国人民是一向友好的；美国政府——美帝国主义者却永远是中国人民的敌人。你知道你们的飞机曾不断飞临中国的领空进行侦察、扫射和轰炸吗？”
    “那或者是偶然的误会。”
    “真奇怪，在中国的山东沿海，在东北的中朝边境，不断有美国飞机侦察、轰炸、扫射。据十一月初的不完全统计，仅中朝边境一带三个月即达八十八次之多，这难道是偶然的吗？”
    在他的脑子里，是非、黑白一向是颠倒与混淆的，他所得到的教育也只能是这样的无知与愚蠢，怎么会知道这些东西？于是他哑口无言了。
    谈话完毕，这个俘虏——美国少校——被押送到另一处的路上，我和他一起走着。他佝偻着身躯，拄着一根木棍，艰难地移动着脚步。我说：“假使你不当兵，不来朝鲜，这时你该是何等的快活！”这位曾经耀武扬威一时的美国少校，继续无言地吃力地走着，低垂着头，心头是悲伤？是懊丧？或是其他？他自己知道。
    突然，四架美国飞机飞来，在附近的山沟里疯狂地轮番俯冲扫射，吓得这位美国少校歪倒在道旁躲避。再继续前进的时候，我说：
    “你们的飞机我们是恨透了！”
    他突然转过脸来，瞪着两眼，带着无限肯定的语气说：
    “我也同样地仇恨他们！”
    这个被俘的美国少校，家住在美国马里兰州（Maryland），巴尔堤摩城（Balteimore）、卡洛林街（Coroline）一七○一号。他于十二月十八日向他的爱妻米尔缀德·Ｔ·哈兰（Mildred.T.Harlan），发出了被俘后的第二封信。信里面说：
    “中国人民志愿部队对我很和蔼。他们把食物和烟分给我，并给以可能做到的医疗帮助。我不久将被移入俘虏营和其他的俘虏们在一起。将来我可能被释放。
    这里是非常冷的。
    注意你自己和孩子们，为我祈祷持久和平和平安回家。”
    让被华尔街老板们驱逐到寒冷的朝鲜战场上的美国士兵和他们的家人们知道吧，凡是勇敢地向中朝人民部队放下武器的人，都会得到同样的优待。
