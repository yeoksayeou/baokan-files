People's Daily transfers to the people of all circles in Beijing:

We have been working to rescue and treat the wounded for over half a month. We conveyed your concern for them to the gloriously wounded heroes. They all firmly expressed their determination to heal their wounds quickly and return to the front lines to eliminate the enemy, defend the motherland, and defend their homes. Now, we report to you on the situation since leaving Beijing.

Along the way, we were inspired by the "Resist America, Aid Korea" enthusiasm of millions of people. When passing through Tianjin, we met with the Tianjin Volunteer Medical Team. Everyone embraced warmly, tears of excitement flowing down. Each tear represented a strength, a strength that is invincible. On the train, all the passengers comforted us and wished us success in our work. A girl, not yet ten years old, held our hands intimately and said, "I wish you a successful completion of your mission," which was truly moving. After a day and night of rapid train travel, countless chimneys emitting black smoke appeared in the distance. We crowded at the window, gazing at the boundless Shenyang industrial area. Captain Chen Jingyun said, "I came here in 1947 and saw no smoke at all. Now, thousands of chimneys are emitting smoke, which are the fruits of the laboring people's creation, and we will never allow American imperialism to invade."

In Shenyang, the leaders encouraged us to learn from Comrade Bethune's internationalist spirit of serving the wounded for five days and nights without sleep. Upon arriving at the front, we met with the Shanghai Surgical Team led by Comrade Li Landing. At the get-together of fraternal units, we cheered for the victory of fighting side by side. Comrade Li Landing, who has been tested by ten years of revolution, is a good example for us. Representatives of the Hungarian Volunteer Surgical Team, Nemesi, and Huang Shoufeng (a Korean comrade) also came to participate. Amidst warm applause, Nemesi said, "The Korean War is part of the struggle between the world's two major camps; we will fight side by side in the future and will surely complete the task assigned to us by the people of the world, driving American imperialism out of Korea...." As soon as he finished speaking, thunderous cheers erupted: "Long live Rakosi!" Then, Comrade Huang Shoufeng said, "When I heard the Chinese People's Volunteer Army blowing its resounding bugle, my heart felt like it was about to jump out. Since the Chinese Volunteer Army participated in the battle, our victory has been in sight. Korean newspapers publish many articles every day praising the Chinese People's Volunteer Army...." Then, there was another storm of applause, and everyone was excited, shouting, "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" This great internationalist spirit has educated us and we will absolutely not allow the American imperialist aggression suffered by the Chinese people for the past century to continue to develop. In the flood of resisting America, American imperialism will soon perish.

On December 11th, we began to receive the wounded. Although they suffered much physical pain, their will to fight the enemy is very strong. They said, "With you here, we are even more encouraged to bravely kill the enemy, because if we are injured, you will treat us...." In their joint operations with the Korean People's Army, they overcame all difficulties; countless villages were burned down by the American imperialist bandits, and the army had no houses to live in, camping in the open; under the constant bombing of enemy planes, they could not cook and ate dry biscuits and drank cold water. In such arduous struggles, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army finally achieved victory. One soldier said, "The atomic bomb cannot determine the outcome of the war, only a just war can win." The volunteers clearly understand why they are fighting. On the contrary, American soldiers, after being captured, still do not know why they came to Korea to fight. The glorious deeds of the volunteers have raised our ideological awareness. Our work is full of enthusiasm, and we actively serve the wounded heroes.

Here, the wounded do not receive the same good treatment conditions as in Beijing hospitals because of the lack of medicine. Therefore, we have put forward the call to overcome difficulties and save materials. Dr. Huang Cuiting said, "Everyone must be careful when using a cotton ball or a piece of gauze and must not waste it." We hope that the Beijing medical community will also launch a movement to save medical supplies and support the front lines with the materials saved. We feel that the most needed items are gauze, bandages, penicillin, sulfathiazole, and X-ray film. We hope that this saving-to-support-the-front movement will be launched soon, and at the same time, we will definitely work hard to complete the tasks you have entrusted to us. With best regards and wishing you a happy new year.

The entire team of the Beijing People's Volunteer Surgical Team.

### 北京人民志愿手术队函京市各界  报告在朝已展开治疗工作  希望医药界节约医药用品支援朝鲜前线

　　北京人民志愿手术队函京市各界
    报告在朝已展开治疗工作
    希望医药界节约医药用品支援朝鲜前线人民日报转北京市各界人民：
    我们展开救护伤员工作，已经半个多月了。在光荣负伤勇士的面前，转达了你们对于他们的关怀。他们都坚决表示要赶快治好创伤，重回前线消灭敌人；保卫祖国，保卫家乡。现在把离京后的情形报告你们。
    在沿途上，我们受到了千万人民“抗美援朝”热情的鼓舞。经过天津时，和天津志愿医疗队会师，大家热烈的拥抱，激动得流下眼泪，每一滴泪都代表着一分力量，这力量是不可战胜的。在火车上，全列车的旅客，慰问我们，祝我们工作成功。一个不足十岁的女孩子亲密的握着我们的手，她说：“祝你们胜利完成任务”，真使人感动极了。经过了一昼夜，在列车的急驰中，从远处出现无数的烟筒冒着黑烟。我们拥挤在窗口，凝视着一望无际的沈阳工业区。陈景云队长说：“一九四七年我来这里，看不到一点烟。现在千万个烟筒都冒着烟，这是劳动人民创造的果实，绝不允许美帝来侵犯。”
    在沈阳时，首长勉励我们学习白求恩同志五昼夜不眠为伤员服务的国际主义精神。到前方又和李蓝丁同志带领的上海手术队会师。在兄弟部队的联欢会上，为并肩作战的胜利而欢呼。受过十年革命考验的李蓝丁同志，是我们的好榜样。匈牙利志愿手术队代表聂梅西和黄寿凤（朝鲜同志）也赶来参加。在热烈的掌声中，聂梅西讲话说：“朝鲜战争是世界两大阵营斗争的一部分；我们今后并肩作战，必能完成世界人民交给我们的任务，把美帝赶出朝鲜去……。”他的话刚结束，立刻响起了震天的欢呼声：“拉科西万岁！”接着黄寿凤同志说：“当我听见中国人民志愿军吹起响亮的号角，我的心好像要跳出来了。从中国志愿部队参加作战后，我们的胜利已摆在面前。朝鲜报纸每天都有许多热爱中国人民志愿军的文章……。”接着又是一阵暴风雨似的欢呼，每个人的心都激动起来，高呼：“金日成将军万岁”“毛主席万岁”。这种伟大的国际主义精神教育了我们，绝不允许百年来中国人民所遭受的美帝侵略再发展下去。在抗美的洪涛里，美帝国主义将要很快的灭亡。
    十二月十一日，我们开始收容伤员。虽然他们肉体上遭受许多痛苦，但对敌人斗争的意志是非常坚强的。他们说：“有你们在这里，更鼓舞了我们勇敢杀敌，因为受了伤有你们医治……。”他们与朝鲜人民军并肩作战中，克服了一切困难；无数的村庄都被美帝强盗们烧毁了，军队没有房子住，露天宿营；在整天的敌机轰炸下，无法烧饭，吃干饼喝凉水。在这样艰苦的斗争中，人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军终于获得了胜利。一位战士说：“原子弹不能决定战争胜负，只有正义的战争才能胜利。”志愿军都很清楚的了解为何而战。相反的，美国兵被俘后，还不知道为什么来朝鲜作战。志愿军的光荣事迹，提高了我们的思想觉悟。在工作中都充溢着饱满的热情，为负伤勇士积极服务。
    在这里的伤员，因为医药缺乏，得不到北京市医院中那样好的治疗条件。因此我们提出了克服困难，节省物资的号召。黄萃庭大夫说：“每个人用一个棉花球或一块纱布都要小心，不能浪费”。我们希望北京医药界也展开医药用品的节约运动，将节省下来的物资支援前线。我们感觉最需要的是纱布、绷带、盘尼西林、磺胺噻唑和Ｘ光胶片等。我们希望这个节约支前运动很快的展开，同时我们也一定积极的努力完成你们所交给我们的任务。此致敬礼  并祝新年快乐
                       北京市人民志愿手术队全体队员
