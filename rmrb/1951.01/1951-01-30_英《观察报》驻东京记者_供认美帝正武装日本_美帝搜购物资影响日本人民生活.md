Xinhua News Agency, London, January 27th: The reactionary British newspaper, "The Observer," recently published an article by its Tokyo correspondent on the remilitarization of Japan. The article openly declares: "Due to the continuous defeats suffered by the Allied forces in Korea, the rearmament of Japan has now begun." Contrary to the public statements of the British and American authorities, who are attempting to disguise the rebuilding of the Japanese army by using the "Police Force" as a cover, the correspondent points out: "The so-called police are wearing American-style uniforms, trained by American officers, enjoy special status, and receive higher salaries than the police in any other country."

The newspaper admits: "Japan already has the backbone of a powerful army organized by the National Police Reserve Force, which is virtually fully mobilized, with 50 percent being veterans of World War II. In other words, Japan is armed to a degree far exceeding the needs of ordinary police."

Xinhua News Agency, January 29th, Tokyo Dispatch: As a result of the United States' massive plundering of Japanese material resources for the war of aggression in Korea, the lives of the Japanese people are becoming increasingly difficult. According to a recent announcement by the Yoshida reactionary government's Economic Stabilization Board: based on materials provided by MacArthur Headquarters, from the outbreak of the Korean War to January 14th of this year, the total value of "special procurement" contracts signed in Japan by the United States for the purpose of the Korean War has reached $204.5 million. The majority of this is for materials, and the rest is for labor.

The result of the United States' massive procurement of Japanese materials has fueled inflation and rising prices in Japan. According to official figures, the amount of Japanese currency in circulation was over 290 billion yen on June 20th of last year, and by January 5th of this year, it had increased to over 410 billion yen, an increase of more than 40 percent. Furthermore, the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, Shuto Hideo, revealed at a cabinet meeting on January 12th: "The impact of special procurement on general prices is that, taking the prices of June last year as the standard, wholesale prices have risen by about 20 percent."

At the same time, the supply of civilian goods has also been drastically reduced. For example, according to the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the allocation of cotton yarn for civilian clothing, originally set at 140 million pounds last year, was reduced to 80 million pounds. The number of trucks for domestic use in Japan was 1,363 in June of last year, but this was reduced to 810 in September.

    供认美帝正武装日本
    美帝搜购物资影响日本人民生活
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伦敦二十七日电：反动的英国报纸《观察报》，顷发表该报驻东京记者论日本重新军国主义化专文一篇。该文公开宣称：“由于盟国在朝鲜遭受不断的败绩，现在已经开始重新武装日本了。”与借《警察部队》作为掩饰以图伪装重建日本军队的英美当局的公开声明相反，记者指出：“所谓警察是穿着美国式的制服，由美国军官们训练，享受特殊的地位，并且较任何国家的警察所得的薪水都要高些。”
    该报承认：“日本已经有由国家警察后备队所组织的一支强大军队的中坚，这种警察后备队实际上已经全部动员，百分之五十都是第二次世界大战的退伍军人。换句话说，日本武装的程度远超过寻常警察的需要。”
    【新华社二十九日讯】东京消息：美国大量盗用日本物力进行侵朝战争的结果，使日本人民的生活更加陷于困境。据日本吉田反动政府经济安定本部最近宣布：根据麦克阿瑟总部所供给的材料，自朝鲜战争爆发至今年一月十四日为止，美国为进行朝鲜战争而在日本签订的“特别需要”合同，总额已达二亿零四十五万美元。其中大部分为物资，其余则为劳务。
    美国如此大量搜购日本物资的结果，助长了日本的通货膨胀与物价上涨。根据官方数字，日本通货发行额，在去年六月二十日为二千九百余亿日元，到今年一月五日时，已增加为四千一百余亿日元，计增加了百分之四十以上。又据经济安定本部长官周东英雄在一月十二日的内阁会议上透露：“特别需要对一般物价的影响是，如以去年六月物价为标准，则批发物价已约上涨百分之二十。”
    同时，民用品的供应也被大肆压缩。例如，据“日本经济新闻”透露，民用衣料的棉纱分配，去年原定为一亿四千万磅，后竟减至八千万磅。供日本国内自用的卡车，去年六月为一千三百六十三辆，至九月则减到八百十辆。
