Xinhua News Agency, 28th. American warmonger Eisenhower, after touring the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, returned to New York on the 27th, ending his travels since the 7th of this month to piece together his unified aggressive army. On his way back to the US from France on the 25th, Eisenhower stopped in Iceland and Canada. His activities, like those in Western Europe, were met with protests by the people. When he arrived in Ottawa on the evening of the 26th, Canadian youth held anti-war demonstrations. They shouted: "Eisenhower, go home!" "No conscription!" The placards they held read: "Canadians will never support the American war!"

Grover, the Paris bureau chief of the Associated Press, who accompanied Eisenhower on his tour of Western European countries, revealed in a dispatch on the 25th that Eisenhower's purpose in this trip was to investigate: "What is the greatest contribution that Europe can offer" to the US war plan? However, Grover admitted: "The answers from the various countries are not enough to satisfy the person responsible for urging Western defense (should read: aggression plan). The difficult fact is: most Western European countries are unwilling to spend money, and most are afraid." Grover admitted that if the reactionary governments of Western European countries pursue the adventurous policies of the United States, it will cause serious economic difficulties and lead to their own destruction in the aggressive war provoked by the United States.

　　艾森豪威尔凄然返美
    【新华社二十八日讯】巡行北大西洋集团各国的美国战争贩子艾森豪威尔已于二十七日返抵纽约，结束了他自本月七日以来为拚凑其统一侵略军的奔波。艾森豪威尔在二十五日离法返美途中，曾先后到过冰岛和加拿大。他的活动也像在西欧一样受到了人民的抗议。当他在二十六日晚间抵渥太华时，加拿大青年们举行了反战示威。他们高呼：“艾森豪威尔滚回去！”“不准征兵！”他们高举的标语牌上面写着：“加拿大人决不支持美国佬的战争！”
    此次曾随艾森豪威尔巡视西欧各国的美联社巴黎分社社长格罗维尔在二十五日的电讯中透露：艾森豪威尔此行的目的是要调查：对于美国的战争计划，“欧洲所能提供的最大的贡献是什么？”但是，格罗维尔承认：“各国的答案都不足以满足这位负责督促西方防务（应读作侵略计划）的人。很困难的事实是：西欧大部分国家都不愿花钱，而且大部分都害怕。”格罗维尔承认西欧各国反动政府如果奉行美国的冒险政策，会造成严重的经济困难，并使自己在美国挑起的侵略战争中覆亡。
