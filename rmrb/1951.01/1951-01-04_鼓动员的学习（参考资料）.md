　　Agitator's Learning (Reference Material)
　　Vladimirov
　　Vladimir Ilyich Lenin called the Bolshevik Party's agitators the plenipotentiaries of Soviet power among the masses. Agitators explain the decisions of the Party and the government to the workers, introduce current events at home and abroad, and educate the broad masses of working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, loyal to their great socialist motherland.
　　The Bolshevik Party attaches great importance to the title of agitator, makes huge demands on it, and charges Party organizations with selecting agitator cadres from politically conscious activists in production departments and social life.
　　In the Soviet Union, Soviet and Party workers, Soviet cultural, scientific and technical activists, and advanced workers in factories, manufacturing plants, and collective farms are absorbed into propaganda work. Party members and non-Party members jointly carry out propaganda work.
　　Lively and sincere agitation is a great art. In order for agitator cadres to master this art, they must be given planned and precise training. The Party organizations of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) regularly concern themselves with raising the ideological, theoretical, and cultural level of agitators.
　　Agitators must first receive daily basic training in the agitation groups established by the Party's grassroots organizations.
　　The agitator's study plan is usually approved by the Party branch or general membership meeting for one month. The work of the agitation group is the responsibility of the Party committee secretary.
　　For example, the study organized by the agitation group of the Moscow Experimental Machine and Weighing Factory, with a total of thirty agitators participating in the study, is now cited as an example.
　　Agitators are called together for a one-and-a-half to two-hour study session every day. Agitators listen to reports on the instructions for this forum, discuss the issues of past forums, and answer questions, etc. In the past half year, the following topics have been discussed at these study sessions: "Summary of Completing the Production Plan and the Tasks of Agitators," "The Growth of the Democratic Camp's Strength and the Struggle for Peace," "Attaching Importance to the Glory of Factory Trademarks," "The Korean People's Heroic Struggle for Their Independence," and others. As the discussion topics listed above show, the agitation group not only discusses general political issues, but also discusses issues reflecting factory production and social life.
　　In order to guide the agitators' study, the Party committee secretary invites factory propagandists, economic and technical experts to make reports. After listening to the reports, the agitators receive necessary reference materials from the leaders of the agitation group, and prepare their own speaking plans based on the reports and various materials.
　　If the agitator has difficulty answering any curriculum questions immediately during the conversation, then he will receive a clear and detailed explanation at the agitation group meeting later, and then he will notify his audience of this answer.
　　In addition to the agitation groups, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), all Party municipal committees and district committees must hold special meetings for agitators no less than once every two months. At this meeting, responsible cadres of the Party and the Soviet Union give speeches and report on the most important resolutions of the Party and the government, the situation at home and abroad, and the tasks facing the provinces, cities, and districts.
　　This is the situation of an agitator meeting held in Kaganovich District, Krasnodar Territory, and Popovichesk Village. The director of the Agricultural Science Department of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) District Committee gave a report on the new significant upsurge in public animal husbandry in collective farms and state-owned farms. He explained to the agitators the implementation of the Party and government's decision on the three-year plan for the development of public animal husbandry. In his report, he cited interesting figures, introduced the facts about how agricultural workers in the district are fighting for the upsurge in animal husbandry, and the experience of advanced workers in collective farms. In order to help the agitators understand rural animal husbandry more deeply, a book exhibition on animal husbandry issues was organized, displaying illustrations and charts of the growth of animal husbandry in the republic, the district, and in advanced collective farms. Finally, each agitator received a speaking plan on the issues they had heard about.
　　The lecture classes regularly set up by the Party municipal and district committees and the Party branches of large factories are of great significance for improving the ideological and theoretical level and qualifications of agitators. In the lecture classes, general lectures and reports are given to the agitators, and then lively and warm forums are held in groups of twenty-five to thirty people to discuss theoretical and methodological issues.
　　The work experience of the lecture classes regularly set up by the Party branch of the Mikoyan Factory in Rostov City is worthy of our attention. In one study session of the lecture classes, they discussed the issue of reducing product cost prices. The speaker made extensive use of examples from other factories, told the agitators about methods of saving raw materials and materials, and gave a series of practical instructions. The report, which was rich in interesting content, turned into a lively discussion among the participants in the lecture classes. The exchange of opinions and experiences is a necessary condition for promoting the achievements of the lecture classes.
　　The training classes attached to the municipal and district Party committees have the same significance as the lecture classes in training agitators. If the study plan of the regularly active lecture classes is scheduled to be long-term, then the work of the agitator training classes is two to three months each year.
　　In the training classes established by many municipal and district Party committees in Molotov Province, groups of thirty to forty agitators are studying. Classes are held twice a week for four hours each time. First, those agitators who are considered by the Party organization to require special training are sent to the training classes. The study plan of the training classes is divided into three basic parts and is approved by the Molotov Provincial Party Committee. The courses are: general political topics, world economic and political geography, and practical training in mass agitation work. Party work leaders, factory directors, school teachers, and propagandists and speakers from the provincial, municipal, and district Party committees come to the training classes to give reports and hold forums for the agitators.
　　Selecting, educating, and training agitator cadres with high qualifications is an important condition for the success of mass political work.

　　鼓动员的学习（参考资料）
    弗拉基米诺夫
    弗拉基米尔·依里奇·列宁把布尔什维克党的鼓动员叫作苏维埃政权在群众中的全权代表。鼓动员给劳动者讲解党及政府的决定，介绍国内外发生的时事，以忠实于自己伟大社会主义祖国的苏维埃爱国主义精神教育广大劳动群众。
    布尔什维克党高度重视鼓动员的称号，党向它提出巨大的要求并责成党组织从生产部门和社会生活里有政治修养的积极分子中选拔鼓动员干部。
    在苏联把苏维埃及党的工作者，苏维埃文化、科学及技术活动家、工厂、制造所、集体农庄的先进劳动者吸收到宣传鼓动工作里来。党员及非党员共同进行宣传鼓动工作。
    生动、恳切的鼓动——是巨大的艺术。为了鼓动员干部掌握这个艺术起见，必须对他们作有计划的和精密的培养工作。联共党（布）的党组织经常关怀提高鼓动员的思想理论和文化水平。
    鼓动员必须首先在党基层组织所设立的鼓动团内受日常基础训练。
    鼓动员的学习计划通常是一个月由党的支部或党员大会来批准。鼓动团的工作由党委书记负责主持。
    比方，现在所举的例子，就是莫斯科试验机及镑秤工厂的鼓动团所组织的学习，一共有三十名鼓动员参加学习。
    每天召集鼓动员举行一小时半至两小时的学习会。鼓动员听取有关这次座谈的指示报告，讨论过去座谈会的问题，解答疑问等。在过去半年来在这些学习会上共讨论了以下各样问题如：“完成生产计划总结与鼓动员的任务”，“民主阵营力量的增长和争取和平的斗争”，“重视工厂商标的光荣”，“为自己的独立而英勇奋斗的朝鲜人民”，及其他等。按上面所列举的讨论题名显示，鼓动团不只是讨论一般政治问题，同时还讨论反映工厂生产和社会生活等问题。
    党委书记为了指导鼓动员学习起见，邀请工厂宣传员，经济及技术专家作报告。听完报告后，鼓动员从鼓动团的领导者手里领取必需的参考资料，根据听报告及各种材料独自准备订出谈话计划。
    如果鼓动员在谈话中难以立即解答任何课程问题时，那末以后他在鼓动团会议上将得到清楚的详细说明，然后他再把这个解答通知自己的听众。
    除了鼓动团外按照联共党（布）中央委员会的指示所有党市委会及区委会必须每两个月给鼓动员举行不少于一次的特别会议，在这个会议上党及苏维埃的负责干部作讲演，报告有关党及政府最重要的决议，国内外的情势，摆在省、市、区面前的任务等问题。
    这就是卡冈诺维奇区，克拉斯诺达尔斯克边区，波波维切斯克乡村所举行的一个鼓动员会议的情形。联共（布）区委会农业科主任在会议上作了关于集体农庄公共牧畜业及国营农场的牧畜业新的显著高涨的报告。他给鼓动员讲解了党及政府关于发展公共性牧畜业三年计划的决定的执行情况。他在报告里曾经举出有趣的数字，介绍区农业工作人员怎样为牧畜业的高涨而斗争的事实及集体农庄先进工作者的经验。为了帮助鼓动员更深刻了解乡村牧畜业起见曾经组织了有关牧畜业问题的书籍展览会，陈列了在该共和国、该区以及在先进集体农庄的牧畜业的增长图解说明及图表等。最后每个鼓动员得到了关于所听到的问题的谈话计划。
    在市、区党委会及大工厂的党支部常设的讲习班，对于提高鼓动员思想理论水平及资格方面，具有重大意义。在讲习班上给鼓动员作一般的讲演和报告，然后再按每组二十五至三十人举行生动热烈的座谈会讨论理论的及方法的问题。
    罗斯多夫城米高扬工厂党支部常设的讲习班工作经验是值得我们注意的。在讲习班的一个学习时间他们讨论了有关降低产品成本价格的问题。讲演者广泛利用其他工厂的实例，给鼓动员述说节省原料及材料的方法，作了一系列的实际指示。富有趣味的内容充实的报告变为了讲习班参加者的生动活泼的讨论会。交换意见、经验乃是促进讲习班工作成就的必需条件。
    在市、区党委会所附设的训练班在培养鼓动员方面，与讲习班具有同样的意义。如果经常活动的讲习班的学习计划预定是长期的，那末，鼓动员训练班每年的工作是两个月至三个月。
    在莫洛托夫省许多市及区党委会所设立的训练班中，三四十名为一组鼓动员在学习着。每周上课两次每次四小时。首先到训练班受训的那些鼓动员是按照党组织意见认为必须特别训练的人。训练班的学习计划共分为三个基本部分，由莫洛托夫省党委批准。课程是：一般政治论题，世界经济及政治地理，群众鼓动工作的实习。党的工作领导者，工厂厂长、学校教师，省、市、区党委会的宣传员和讲演者等人到训练班给鼓动员作报告和举行座谈会。
    选拔、教育和培养有高度资格的鼓动员干部乃是群众政治工作成功的重要条件。
