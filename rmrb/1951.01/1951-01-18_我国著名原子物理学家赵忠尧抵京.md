　　[By Our Newspaper] Prominent Chinese atomic physicist Mr. Zhao Zhongyao arrived in Beijing yesterday morning from Nanjing. Mr. Zhao departed from the United States on August 29th of last year. While passing through Yokohama, Japan, he was unreasonably detained by the intelligence department of the American imperialist occupation forces in Japan. He was not freed until November 15th. On November 20th, he boarded a ship in Yokohama to return to China. While passing through Hong Kong, he was monitored by police sent by the British government, who "escorted" him out of the territory. After returning to China, Mr. Zhao stayed in Nanjing for over a month. After arriving in Beijing, Mr. Zhao will engage in atomic nucleus research at the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
