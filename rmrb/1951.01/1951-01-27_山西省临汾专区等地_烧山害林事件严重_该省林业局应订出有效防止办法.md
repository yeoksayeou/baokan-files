　　Serious Cases of Burning Mountains and Damaging Forests in Linfen Prefecture, Shanxi Province, etc.
    The Provincial Forestry Bureau Should Formulate Effective Prevention Measures
    To the Editors:
    In the winter of 1950, cases of burning and destroying mountain forests in Shanxi Province were still quite serious. According to incomplete statistics, from October 15 to the end of November 1950, a total of 34 incidents of burning mountain forests occurred in the province, destroying more than 20,500 mu of mountain forest area and more than 165,600 trees. This is a huge destruction of the beautiful mountain forest resources of our great motherland.
    Among these incidents of burning mountain forests, the damage within the jurisdiction of the Fifth Forestry Sub-bureau in the Linfen area was even more serious. The area of ​​mountain forests burned in the entire Linfen Prefecture reached more than 10,700 mu, accounting for 50 percent of the mountain area burned in the province; a total of 106,700 trees were burned, accounting for more than 64 percent of the number of trees burned in the province. This is due to the leadership's neglect of mountain forest protection and failure to organize and educate the masses in a timely manner. Wang Hua, the director of the bureau, did not pay enough attention to leading and educating the masses to protect mountain forests. At the second provincial forestry conference, Comrade Wang Hua even stated that the masses in the forest areas under the bureau's jurisdiction did not need to rely on the mountains for their livelihoods. Although he was criticized at the time, the actual work of the bureau afterwards still reflected the leadership's shortcomings in relaxing leadership and educating the masses to protect mountain forests. Therefore, the burning mountain incidents in the area became the most serious in the province. Moreover, the unled indiscriminate logging of mountain forests by the masses in the forest areas of Fenxi, Xiangning and other places under the area's jurisdiction is also very serious.
    In the process of extinguishing mountain forest fires in various places, many activists protecting mountain forests have emerged. After a fire broke out in the large grassland forest in Jiaocheng, Li Husan, a member of the village's forest protection team, immediately ran to Hengjian Town to report to the forestry office. An Guofu, Zhang Shengda and other eight members of the village's other forest protection team also automatically tried to put out the fire, so the fire was quickly extinguished. When a fire broke out in Diaofushan behind the Sandaogou River in Fenyang, Huang Zikui, a member of the village's forest protection team, immediately mobilized the masses to put out the fire and arrested Dong Changdan and his son, who started the fire. When the fire on Yunmeng Mountain in Xi County spread to Shiban Gou in Zhongyang County, Bai Shimin, a cadre of the Zhongyang Public Security Bureau, also mobilized the masses in Fengwei Village in time to put out the mountain fire.

    Editor's Note: The incidents of burning mountain forests that have occurred in various parts of Shanxi Province have caused serious losses to the wealth of the motherland. Since the liberation of Shanxi, serious mountain burning incidents have occurred continuously in the winter of 1949 and the spring of 1950. We suggest that the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau should formulate effective prevention measures for forest protection work, those who burn and destroy mountain forests must be held accountable, and those who have made meritorious contributions to protecting the mountain forests of the motherland should be rewarded.

　　山西省临汾专区等地
    烧山害林事件严重           
     该省林业局应订出有效防止办法编辑同志：
    一九五○年冬季，山西全省烧毁山林的事件仍然是相当严重的。据不完全的统计，自一九五○年十月十五日开始到十一月底止，全省共发生烧毁山林事件三十四起，烧毁山林面积二万零五百余亩，烧毁树木十六万五千六百多株。这是对我们伟大祖国美好山林资源的巨大破害。
    这些烧毁山林的事件中，临汾地区的林业第五分局辖区以内的损害是更加严重的。全临汾专区烧毁山林的面积共达一万零七百多亩，占全省烧山面积百分之五十；烧毁树木共达十万零六千七百株，占全省烧毁株数的百分之六十四以上。这是由于该局领导方面存在着轻视山林的保护，没有及时组织与教育群众所致。该局王华局长对于领导与教育群众保护山林的重视是不够的，在省的第二届林业会议上，王华同志并曾表示：该局所属林区群众并不需要靠山吃饭，当时，虽曾受到批判，但是在此后该局的实际工作上仍然反映了领导方面放松领导教育群众保护山林的缺点。因此，该区烧山事件，成为全省最严重者。而且该区所属汾西、乡宁等地林区的群众，无领导地乱伐山林的事件也是很严重的。
    各地扑灭山林火灾中，出现了不少保护山林的积极分子。交城大草坪山林失火后，该村护林组员李虎三立刻跑步到横尖镇向林业办事处报告。该村其他的护林组员安国富、张生达等八人，并自动设法救火，因此这次火灾很快就被扑灭。汾阳三道川后刁福山发生火灾时，该村护林组员黄自奎，立刻动员群众施救，并将放火者董长旦父子二人捉住。隰县云梦山大火延烧至中阳县的石板沟时，中阳公安局干部白世民，也及时动员凤尾村群众将山火扑灭了。
          山西省林业局  贾茂亭  张毅夫                
    编者按：山西省各地发生的烧毁山林事件，造成了祖国财富的严重损失。山西解放以后，一九四九年冬季，一九五零年春季，都曾连续发生过严重的烧山事件，我们建议山西省林业局对护林工作应订出有效的防止办法，山林被烧毁必须追究责任，并应奖励那些保护祖国山林有功的人员。
