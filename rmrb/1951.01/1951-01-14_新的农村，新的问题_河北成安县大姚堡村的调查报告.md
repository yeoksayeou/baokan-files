　　New Rural Areas, New Problems
　　An Investigation Report on Dayaobao Village, Cheng'an County, Hebei
　　By the Hebei Handan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　Dayaobao is a medium-sized village in Cheng'an County, Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province. The village has 215 households, 913 people, 4,393 mu of land, and 82 head of livestock. It is not a poor village and can represent the general villages in cotton-producing areas.

　　Current Economic Situation of the Village

　　After two or three years of production recovery, the living standards of the masses have gradually increased, and production tools have surpassed the pre-war level. The whole village presents a new atmosphere of construction. In the spring of 1950, the village built 93 new houses, mostly new brick and white ash tiled houses. In the past, the village had the habit of eating "lao mi fan" (rice cooked in a special way), but now many people eat noodles. Generally, people eat wheat flour meals every two or three days, and one wheat flour meal a day during busy times. In the winter of 1950, 80 percent of the village people wore new cotton-padded clothes, and most children and young women wore foreign cloth clothes. In terms of farm tools and draught animals, the village had 43 head of livestock in 1947, which increased to 50 in 1948, 73 in 1949 (cattle and donkeys), and 82 in 1950. In addition, four waterwheels, one large cart, five weeding hoes, and more than twenty pieces of plows, harrows, and seed drills were added. Besides, more than 20 households are preparing to build houses, and more than a dozen households are preparing to buy livestock.

　　The total income of the village in 1950 was 1,157,520 jin of rice, an average of 1,267 jin per person. Public grain expenses accounted for 7.6 percent of the total income, and living expenses accounted for 63 percent of the total income (including food accounting for 59.7 percent, oil and salt accounting for 5.7 percent, charcoal for fuel accounting for 7.5 percent, clothing accounting for 7.4 percent, pocket money (smoking, children's expenses) accounting for 8.3 percent, and livestock feed accounting for 11.1 percent). 27 percent of the total income can be invested in production. In 1949, the investment in production was mainly in farm tools and livestock, while in 1950, the investment in production was mainly in fertilizer, which doubled compared with 1949, accounting for 17 percent of the total income. In addition to investing in production, the village can have a surplus of 130,000 jin of rice, an average of 150 jin per person. The household with the most surplus can have 6,800 jin.

　　The wealth of the village can be divided into four categories: The first category has three households with a surplus of more than 3,000 jin. The second category has 34 households with a surplus of 1,500 jin to 2,000 jin. The third category has 168 households whose production income is sufficient for the family expenses, and most can have a surplus of 300 to 500 jin. The fourth category has ten households whose production is not enough to cover expenses, and they maintain their lives by borrowing and scraping, mainly the old, weak, and disabled.

　　Reasons for increased income: First, after the land reform, the productive forces were liberated, and the production income was entirely owned by themselves, which greatly improved the enthusiasm for production. Second, various production policies were implemented, dispelling the farmers' worries about "standing out," and the farmers dared to invest in the land. In 1949, one cart of fertilizer was applied per mu, and in 1950, one and a half carts of fertilizer were applied per mu, and one to two dou of black beans were also planted. Qiao Shilun was able to have a surplus of 6,000 jin of grain because he dared to invest, dig wells, and buy waterwheels, which enabled the development of production. Third, more cotton was planted. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the village planted 1,850 mu of cotton, 1,400 mu in 1948, 2,370 mu in 1949, and 3,205 mu in 1950. After the masses made profits from growing cotton, they will expand the cotton planting area. It is estimated that in 1951, the village's cotton planting will reach 95 percent of the total cultivated land area. Fourth, the farming techniques have been generally improved. The village has generally implemented seed soaking and seed selection. Most of the cotton planted is No. 4 Sz cotton, and a small number is No. 2 Sz cotton. Due to the use of new-style farm tools such as weeding hoes, the village generally hoeed cotton seven or eight times in 1950, an increase of one to two times compared with 1949.

　　At present, the most common and urgent demands of the masses are to purchase fertilizers (black beans), grain, and livestock feed. In 1950, the village needed 190,000 jin of fertilizer, which could not be solved by the masses buying it themselves. As farmer Yang Dong said: "We can't buy it even if we want to." The masses are afraid of not being able to buy grain, so they dare not sell cotton. Secondly, new-style farm tools (weeding hoes, waterwheels, flower seed drills) are also urgently needed by some of the masses.

　　Several Problems to be Solved

　　1. Under the leadership and support of the government in production, the farmers in the old liberated areas, especially the farmers in the cotton-producing areas, have rapidly caught up with the pre-war production level, and the living standards of the masses have begun to improve. In this situation, how to lead the masses to correctly use the surplus labor and surplus purchasing power is a problem that must be solved in order to lead the masses to move forward. If this problem cannot be solved, the farmers will waste their surplus labor and wealth, which is worthy of attention.

　　2. With the development of cash crops and the improvement of the people's living standards, the supply and marketing work in rural areas plays a significant role; however, the supply and marketing work in rural areas cannot keep up with the needs of the farmers. There are 100 cooperative members in this village, but no village cooperative has been organized, and they can only receive some rationed materials (kerosene, salt) every month, and cannot solve the problem of farmers selling cotton in large quantities and purchasing fertilizer.

　　3. The work of the Party branch must keep up. Some Party member cadres have gradually changed their thinking because their family lives have begun to improve, and some are even unwilling to work negatively, and do not know which direction they and the masses should develop, so they cannot take on the task of leading the masses to develop production.

　　4. The masses should be educated to make long-term plans, prevent waste, organize mutual aid, further develop production, and seek a more prosperous life. Especially the issue of organizing mutual aid. The current situation is no longer the difficulty of lacking labor in the past, but a new situation of having surplus labor and surplus financial resources. Therefore, organizing mutual aid must add new content, and simply using the old ways of the past cannot keep up with the needs of the masses.

　　新的农村，新的问题
    河北成安县大姚堡村的调查报告
    中共河北邯郸地委会
    大姚堡是河北邯郸专区成安县的一个中等村。全村二一五户，九一三人，土地四、三九三亩，牲口八二头，不算穷村，可以代表产棉区的一般村庄。
    全村经济现状
    经过两三年的恢复生产，群众的生活水平已逐渐上升，生产工具已超过了战前，全村呈现着一种建设的新气象。一九五○年春季该村曾盖新房九十三间，大部是新砖白灰的瓦房。过去该村有吃捞米饭的习惯，现在吃面的已不少，一般的是两三天吃一顿白面，忙时一天吃一顿。一九五○年冬季全村有百分之八十的人都穿上了新棉衣，小孩和青年妇女多数是穿洋布衣服。农具、耕畜方面，一九四七年全村有四十三头牲口，一九四八年增至五十头，一九四九年增至七十三头（牛、驴），一九五○年增至八十二头，并增加了四辆水车，一辆大车，五张耘锄及犁、耙、耧二十余件。此外，还有二十多户准备盖房子，十几户准备买牲口。
    全村一九五○年总收入一、一五七、五二○斤米，每人平均一、二六七斤。公粮开支占总收入百分之七·六，生活开支占总收入百分之六十三（内食粮占百分之五九·七，油盐占百分之五·七，烧炭占百分之七·五，穿衣占百分之七·四，零用（吸烟、小孩花）占百分之八·三，牲口草料占百分之十一·一）。总收入的百分之二十七均能投入生产。一九四九年投入生产的主要是农具、牲口，一九五○年投入生产的主要是肥料，比一九四九年增加一倍，占总收入百分之十七。全村除投资生产外，可剩余十三万斤米，每人平均一百五十斤。最多的户能余六千八百斤。
    全村富力大小可以分成四类：第一类三户，能剩余三千斤以上。第二类三十四户，能剩余一千五百斤至二千斤。第三类一百六十八户，生产收入够全家费用，多数能余三至五百斤。第四类十户，生产不够开支，挪挪借借，维持生活，其中主要是老弱残废。
    收入增加的原因：一、土改后生产力获得解放，生产收入完全归自己所有，大大提高了生产情绪。二、贯彻了各种生产政策，解除了农民怕“冒尖”的思想顾虑，农民敢向土地投资。一九四九年每亩施肥一车，一九五○年每亩施肥一车半，并有上黑豆一斗至二斗的。乔士伦能剩余六千斤粮食，就是敢投资，打井、买水车，使生产获得了发展。三、种棉多。全村在抗战以前种棉一、八五○亩，一九四八年种棉一、四○○亩，一九四九年种棉二、三七○亩，一九五○年种棉三、二○五亩。群众种棉获利后，将扩大种棉面积，估计一九五一年全村种棉将达耕地总面积的百分之九十五。四、耕作技术普遍提高。该村已普遍实行浸种、选种，种棉多是四号斯字棉，少数是二号斯字棉。由于使用了新式农具耘锄，该村一九五○年棉花一般锄了七、八遍，比一九四九年增锄了一至二遍。
    目前群众最普遍最迫切的要求是购买肥料（黑豆）、粮食和牲口草等问题。一九五○年全村需要十九万斤肥料，单靠群众自己去买是不能解决的，如农民杨栋说：“俺买就买不到。”群众怕买不到粮食，存着棉花不敢卖。其次，新式农具（耘锄、水车、种花耧），也是部分群众迫切需要的。
    几个须要解决的问题
    一、在政府领导与扶持生产下，老区农民特别是产棉区农民，迅速地赶上了战前生产水平，群众生活已开始得到改善。在这种情况下，如何领导群众把剩余劳力和剩余购买力正确地使用起来，这是领导群众向前发展必须解决的问题。如果这个问题不能解决，农民就会将剩余的劳力与财富浪费掉，这是值得注意的。
    二、随着经济作物的发展与群众生活的提高，农村供销工作有其重大作用；可是，供销工作在农村却跟不上农民的需要。这村有一百名合作社员，但是没有组织村社，每月只能领些配给物资（洋油、食盐），并不能解决农民大批外销棉花和购买肥料的问题。
    三、支部工作须要赶上。有些党员干部因自己家庭生活开始改善，思想也逐渐变化，甚至有的消极不愿作工作，也不知道自己和群众应向那个方向发展，因此也就不能担任起领导群众发展生产的任务。
    四、对群众应进行教育，作长期打算，防止浪费，组织互助，进一步发展生产，求得生活更加富裕。特别是组织互助问题，目前的情况，已不是过去的缺乏劳力的困难情况，而是在有剩余劳力和剩余财力的新情况下了，因此，组织互助必须增加新的内容，单纯使用过去老一套的方式已赶不上群众的需要了。
