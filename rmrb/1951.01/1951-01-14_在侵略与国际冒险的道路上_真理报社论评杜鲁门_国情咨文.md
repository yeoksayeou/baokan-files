Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 12th: Pravda published an editorial entitled "On the Path of Aggression and International Adventurism," commenting on the "State of the Union Address" delivered by Truman to the United States Congress on January 8th.

The editorial begins by stating: The style, tone, and content of this address are those of war hysteria. What prompted Truman to make this declaration of war hysteria is the profound crisis reflected in the Truman-Dulles-Acheson policy both inside and outside the United States and within the North Atlantic bloc. The American ruling clique's aggression against Korea and the People's Republic of China has resulted in military defeat for the United States, and politically, the defeat is even greater. At the same time, the squabbles between the United States and its Western European partners are intensifying. Within the United Nations organization, similar disputes are tearing this group apart. And the internal struggles within the American ruling clique are becoming increasingly acute.

The editorial points out: Truman finds it increasingly difficult to pose as the leader of the United Nations. Therefore, he wants to maintain his already shaken prestige by intimidating his allies. At the same time, the purpose of Truman's address is also to further stir up war psychosis domestically in order to divert growing domestic dissatisfaction with him and his government.

The editorial refutes Truman's use of Hitler's habitual lies and sophistry about the Soviet Union's desire to achieve world hegemony to cover up his own aggressive policy, and points out that the address shows that what Truman wants to force the United States to accept is a plan to aggress against the peace-loving people of Asia, Africa, and Europe. He regards Europe as a battlefield and Asia and Africa as sources of cannon fodder and important raw materials for American imperialism.

The editorial further writes: The program of America's domestic policy is entirely determined by its imperialist aims. It includes measures to transform the United States into an arsenal of aggression and to convert the American economy into a wartime system. The most important of these is the demand for more appropriations to continue the arms race and increase the armed forces. The method is to increase heavy taxes and raise the prices of consumer goods, while legislatively stipulating a policy of freezing wages and depriving trade unions of all opportunities to defend the rights of working people. Thus, amidst the clamor of war hysteria, a new and broad offensive against the primary interests and rights of the American people is underway.

The editorial also states that Truman's address once again confirms the existence of huge divisions among the American ruling clique. Truman calls for "Congress to unite at this critical juncture." But under the current circumstances, it is doubtful whether this request will have an appropriate impact. The crisis in American policy is too profound, and Truman's verbal tricks cannot overcome it. Although the Democratic and Republican parties are two parties of the same aggressive American imperialism, the speeches of Hoover and Taft, to a certain extent, reflect domestic dissatisfaction with the president and the government's policies.

The editorial concludes by emphasizing that if the American ruling clique continues to follow the path of aggression and international adventurism, they will not escape new and even more serious failures that will undermine the American state. Truman's habitual attribution of his mistakes to the Soviet Union will not save him from such failure.

### 在侵略与国际冒险的道路上  真理报社论评杜鲁门“国情咨文”

　　在侵略与国际冒险的道路上
    真理报社论评杜鲁门“国情咨文”
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：真理报，以“在侵略与国际冒险的道路上”为题发表社论，评论杜鲁门一月八日向美国国会提出的“国情咨文”。
    社论首称：这个咨文的风格、它的口气和内容是战争歇斯底里的。促使杜鲁门作这种战争歇斯底里的宣告的是，杜鲁门——杜勒斯——艾奇逊的政策反映在美国内外及北大西洋集团阵营内的深刻危机。美国统治集团对朝鲜和中华人民共和国的侵略，使美国遭到军事上的失败，而在政治上，失败甚至更大。同时，美国和它的西欧同伙的互相争吵正在加剧。在联合国组织之内，同样的争吵也在撕裂着这个集团。而美国统治集团内部的斗争，也越来越尖锐了。
    社论指出：杜鲁门已越来越难以冒充联合国的领袖了，因此，他想以恫吓盟国来维持他那已经动摇了的威信。同时，杜鲁门咨文的目的，也在于在国内更加煽起战争心理，以转移国内对他和他的政府日益不满的情绪。
    社论驳斥杜鲁门使用希特勒惯用的关于苏联想取得世界霸权的谎言和狡辩来掩盖自己的侵略政策，并指出，咨文表明杜鲁门所要强使美国接受的，正是一个侵略亚、非、欧各国爱好和平人民的计划。他把欧洲作为战场，把亚非两洲作为美帝国主义炮灰和重要原料的来源地。
    社论进而写道：美国的内政政策的纲领，是完全由它的帝国主义目的决定的。它包括一些要把美国变为侵略的兵工厂、把美国经济改为战时体制的措施。其中最为重要的就是要求更多的拨款以继续军备竞赛和增加武装部队。其办法就是增加重捐税、提高消费品的价格，同时，在立法上规定冻结工资的政策并剥夺工会保卫劳动人民权利的一切机会。这样，在战争歇斯底里的叫嚣中，进攻美国人民的主要利益和权利的新的广泛攻势，正在进行中。
    社论又称，杜鲁门的咨文再度证实，美国统治集团间存在着巨大的分歧。杜鲁门要求“国会在这一紧急关头团结起来”。但在目前情况下，这个要求是否会发生适当的影响是很可疑的。美国的政策的危机是太深刻了，杜鲁门嘴上玩花样是克服不了这一危机的。民主党和共和党虽是同一个侵略的美帝国主义的两个政党，但胡佛和塔夫脱的演说，在一定程度上反映了国内对总统和政府政策的不满。
    社论最后强调，美国统治集团如果继续沿着侵略和国际冒险政策的道路走下去，他们将逃避不了新的甚至更严重的会破坏美国国家的失败。杜鲁门把他的错误归咎于苏联的惯技，是拯救不了他免于这种失败的。
