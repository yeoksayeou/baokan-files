Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 20th (TASS): *Pravda* today published an article by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, entitled "Thirtieth Anniversary of the Italian Communist Party." Togliatti wrote: Thirty years have passed since the Italian Communist Party was founded on January 21, 1921, in Livorno, an Italian city famous for its militant revolutionary traditions.

The Italian Communist Party has experienced a difficult path, and in many ways it has been complex and unique. During the eighteen years from 1926 to 1944, the Party engaged in extremely secret underground work; the founder and leader of the Party, Antonio Gramsci, died in prison after eleven years of brutal imprisonment, and most of our veteran cadres spent many years of their lives in prison. In Livorno in 1921, we were only a minority in the old Italian socialist movement; for eighteen years, we suffered repression, and we could only carry out illegal activities under extremely difficult circumstances. Nevertheless, when the fascist regime began to falter and collapse during World War II, we appeared on the political stage as one of the most numerous, unified, and powerful of all Italian political parties—a party that led the working class and was supported by the broad masses of the people.

The Party currently has 2.5 million members (including 400,000 members of the Communist Youth League); the Party has a decisive influence on the majority of industrial and agricultural workers, its influence extends throughout the countryside, and it penetrates even backward rural areas. In addition, the Italian Communist Party maintains close ties with the Socialist Party, which currently has more than 700,000 members, through an agreement on united action. This strong alliance greatly contributes to strengthening the Italian people's struggle for freedom, peace, and socialism.

The victory achieved by the Communist Party is the result of many years of unyielding struggle and effort. The Italian Communist Party has been able to embark on the correct path of development because it has waged a struggle on two fronts—mastering and applying the Marxist and Leninist doctrines on the Party and the revolution. Gramsci and his successors have all grown up successively studying the experience of the Bolshevik Party and the works of Lenin and Stalin. In this experience and these works, they have found the necessary guide and key to understanding and solving the problems arising from the domestic situation.

As everyone knows, in Europe, we were the first to fight against fascist tyranny; this explains why there were many weaknesses in our past activities. For example, we failed to quickly understand the need to work among members of the fascist "trade unions," etc.

There were years when it seemed that the enemy could suppress our activities almost everywhere with arrests and repression. But our Party's leadership and our cadres have always unyieldingly started to re-establish the Party's organizational network in the country, to strengthen the Party's ranks with the best workers, and to carry out propaganda in enterprises and in the countryside. It is precisely for this reason that the working people throughout Italy began to see the Communists as the only force that held high the banner of the workers' just demands, the banner of democratic freedom, and the banner of socialism, and fought against the bourgeois fascist dictatorship.

As the years went by, the Italian Communist Party began to play an increasingly important role in national life. At first, the fascists were able to deceive broad sections of the population, especially the middle class, making them believe that the fascist regime would safeguard national interests and that this regime would be able to win honor and respect for Italy. But it was precisely in this regard that fascism suffered a complete defeat.

This made more and more Italians open their eyes, and they were filled with determination to save the country from disaster. And when Italian patriots needed help and leadership to resist fascism and drive foreign invaders out of the country, they first found this help and leadership in the Communist Party. Therefore, after the shame and misfortune caused by fascism, the revival of the Italian people, the political and social renewal of Italy, was prepared and organized primarily by the Communist Party.

It is precisely for this reason that our country's reactionary ruling class and the current ruling figures hate us, persecute us again, and dream of dealing with us in the same way as the former fascists did.

After the war ended, we proposed maintaining the unity of all democratic and popular forces, and we proposed that the government should accommodate all parties that were most closely connected with the working people. Such a government could then begin to implement those fundamental reforms necessary to improve the living conditions of the working people, namely: abolishing large industrial monopolies; giving land to the peasants; and appropriately distributing our country's national wealth. However, the reactionary bourgeoisie of Italy has done everything possible to obstruct the implementation of these absolutely essential economic and social reforms.

The Christian Democratic government is now in power, and the party is prepared to use all means to maintain power, and it is prepared to implement the plans of the most reactionary part of Italian society.

Just as Mussolini did to Hitler's Germany, the Gasperi government sacrificed Italy's independence and sovereignty for the benefit of American imperialists. Under the pretext of accepting the notorious "Marshall Plan aid," the development of Italy's peaceful industry has been paralyzed.

Now, the war hysteria of the American imperialists has reached its peak, and the American imperialists are openly inciting and preparing to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The rulers of Italy want the Italian people to bleed again, to allow these rulers to drag them into a new war for the benefit of international reactionaries. But this will not have any results. We declare today that we believe we have enough strength to stop those who are trying to destroy Italy. The fact that more and more Italians are defending peace with us confirms this. Seventeen million Italians have already signed the declaration demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. Now, the ranks of those fighters who are doing everything possible to prevent Italy from participating in the evil new war preparations have become even broader. It has broad support in all sectors of society and is also weakening the ranks of the ruling party itself.

We know that the struggle for peace is not just the task of one party: this struggle is the primary responsibility of all truly democratic forces, and they must work together to resist the evil plans of the warmongers.

We know that the struggle for peace is now entering a most urgent period, because it is clear that the fate of the peoples of the world will depend on the outcome of this struggle. Now it is necessary to save peace not only in Italy, but throughout the world. Let our enemies know that the Italian Communist Party—a heroic, tenacious, and long-tested party of fighters who are loved by the people and connected to the people by millions of unbreakable ties—is doing everything in its power to achieve this goal, and will surely be able to unite the working class and the Italian people to jointly carry out the struggles they must carry out, so as to firmly win and defend peace.

### 意大利共产党三十周年

　　意大利共产党三十周年
    意大利共产党中央委员会总书记  托里亚蒂
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日电：真理报今日刊载意大利共产党中央委员会总书记托里亚蒂所写的题为“意大利共产党三十周年”的论文。托里亚蒂写道：自从意大利共产党于一九二一年一月二十一日在以战斗的革命传统著名的意大利城市里窝那成立以来，到今年一月二十一日已经三十周年了。
    意大利共产党曾经历艰难的道路，而且在许多方面是复杂的与特有的。在一九二六年至一九四四年的十八年期间，党在地下从事极端秘密的工作；党的建立者和领袖安托尼奥·葛兰西经过了十一年残酷监禁后死在狱中，我们大部分的老干部都曾在牢狱中消磨了一生中的许多岁月。一九二一年在里窝那，在旧时意大利社会主义运动中我们还只是一个少数派；在十八年期间，我们遭受镇压，我们只能在极端困难的情况下进行非法活动。虽然这样，当法西斯政权在第二次世界大战期间开始动摇与崩溃的时候，我们就以所有意大利政党中的一个人数最多、最统一与最强大的政党——一个领导工人阶级并受到广大人民群众支持的政党而出现在政治舞台上。
    党在目前拥有二百五十万党员（其中包括四十万共产主义青年团团员）；党对大多数的工业和农业工人具有决定性的影响，它的影响遍及农村并深入到甚至落后的乡区。此外，意大利共产党经由统一行动的协定，与目前拥有七十多万党员的社会党保持着密切的联系。这种强固的联盟大大有助于加强意大利人民争取自由、和平与社会主义的斗争的力量。
    共产党所获致的胜利，是许多年来不屈不挠的斗争和努力的结果。意大利共产党由于在两条战线上进行斗争——掌握与应用马克思与列宁关于党与革命的学说，所以能走上了正确的发展道路。葛兰西和他的后继者，都是先后学习布尔什维克党的经验与列宁和斯大林的著作而成长起来的。他们在这种经验和这些著作里，找到了理解和解决国内形势所产生的问题所必需的指南和锁钥。
    大家知道，在欧洲，是我们最先与法西斯暴政进行斗争；这说明了我们过去的活动中为什么有许多弱点。例如我们未能迅速理解在法西斯“工会”会员中间进行工作的必要性等等。
    曾有过几年，似乎敌人能够用逮捕和高压手段几乎到处把我们的活动压制下去。但是我们的党的领导机构和我们的干部总是不屈不挠地在国内着手重新建立党的组织网，以最优秀的工人来加强党的队伍，并在企业部门和乡间着手进行宣传。正是因为这个缘故，意大利各地劳动人民开始把共产党人看做高举工人正义要求的旗帜、高举民主自由的旗帜和社会主义的旗帜与资产阶级法西斯专政进行斗争的唯一力量。
    随着年月的消逝，意大利共产党在国家生活中开始起着越来越重大的作用。起初，法西斯分子还能欺骗广大阶层的民众，特别是中产阶级，使他们相信法西斯政权是会维护国家利益的，这个政权是能够给意大利赢得名誉和尊敬的。但是法西斯主义正是在这一方面遭到了彻底的失败。
    这就使得越来越多的意大利人睁开了眼睛，他们充满决心，要拯救国家免于大难。而当意大利爱国分子需要帮助和领导以便对法西斯主义进行抵抗并将外国侵略者赶出国境的时候，他们首先就在共产党那里找到了这种帮助和领导。所以在法西斯主义所造成的耻辱与不幸之后，意大利人民的复兴，意大利的政治与社会的革新，首先便是由共产党准备和组织的。
    正因为这个缘故，我国的反动统治阶级和当前的执政人物痛恨我们，再度迫害我们，梦想像从前的法西斯分子那样来对付我们。
    在战争结束后，我们曾建议保持所有民主与人民力量的团结，我们建议政府应容纳所有与劳动人民联系最为密切的党派。这样一个政府就可以着手实行为改善劳动人民生活条件所必需的那些基本改革，这就是：废除大的工业垄断；给农民以土地；适当地分配我国的国民财富。但是，意大利的反动的资产阶级千方百计地阻挠实行这些绝不可少的经济与社会改革。
    基督教民主党的政府现在掌握着政权，该党准备利用一切手段来保持政权，而且准备执行意大利社会中最反动的一部分人的计划。
    正像墨索里尼对希特勒德国所作过的一样，加斯贝利政府为了美国帝国主义者的利益而牺牲了意大利的独立和主权。以接受臭名远扬的“马歇尔计划援助”为借口，意大利和平工业的发展已陷于瘫痪了。
    现在，美帝国主义者的战争歇斯底里已经达到顶点，而且美帝国主义正在公开煽动准备攻击苏联和各人民民主国家的战争火焰，意大利的统治者们想要意大利人民再度流血，要人民容许这些统治者为了国际反动派的利益而把他们拖入新的战争。但这是不会有任何结果的。我们今天宣布，我们认为我们有足够的力量制止那些企图使意大利陷于毁灭的人们。与我们一道保卫和平的意大利人愈来愈多，便证实了这一点。有一千七百万意大利人已经在要求禁止原子武器的宣言上签了名。现在，那些竭尽全力制止意大利参加罪恶的新战争准备的斗士们的阵线已变得更加广大了。它在社会各阶层中都拥有广大的支持者，而且也削弱了执政党本身的队伍。
    我们知道，争取和平的斗争不仅仅是一个政党的任务：这个斗争乃是一切真正民主力量的首要职责，它们必须通力合作以抵制战争贩子们的罪恶计划。
    我们知道，现在争取和平的斗争正在进入一个最紧迫的时期，因为很显然，世界各国人民的命运将以这个斗争的结果为转移。现在不仅要在意大利，而且要在全世界挽救和平。让我们的敌人知道，意大利共产党——一个为人民所热爱并且以千万条割不断的系带与人民联系在一起的英勇顽强的久经锻炼的斗士们的党——正在竭尽全力达成这一目的，而且必然能够团结工人阶级和意大利人民共同进行他们必须进行的斗争，从而稳固地赢得而且保卫和平。
