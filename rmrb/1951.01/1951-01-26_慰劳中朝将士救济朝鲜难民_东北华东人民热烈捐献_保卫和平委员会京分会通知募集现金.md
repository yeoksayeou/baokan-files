Xinhua News Agency reports: People in Northeast and East China are enthusiastically donating money and goods to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers and to relieve Korean refugees.

According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast People's Comfort Committee, before the New Year, it had received comfort money totaling 3,644,300,000 Northeast currency (excluding Jilin Province), 141,500 comfort bags, 2,620,000 catties of pork, 1,753,000 boxes of cigarettes, 649,000 towels, and a large number of daily necessities such as soap, toothbrushes, and toothpaste. In addition, the four provinces of Liaoxi, Liaodong, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang alone collected more than 125,000 letters of sympathy. Most of these comfort items and letters have been shipped to the Korean front, and the rest are being packaged for shipment. The comfort movement has also been widely launched in the vast rural areas. Farmers in Heilongjiang Province alone have donated more than 8,600 fat pigs. Women farmers in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, donated more than 6,800 chickens and more than 60,000 eggs. Grandma Zang of Yongyuan Village, Acheng County, Songjiang Province, wanted to donate all three fat pigs she raised to comfort the People's Volunteers. After repeated persuasion, she finally donated one. She said, "The Volunteers are defending our good life by going to Korea to resist the American devils' invasion. No matter what, I have to kill a pig for the Volunteers to eat."

The Shandong Branch of the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression held an enlarged meeting of its standing committee on the 17th to discuss the issue of carrying out comfort and relief movements in Shandong Province. The meeting also invited representatives from the Shandong Provincial and Jinan Municipal Production and Disaster Relief Committees, as well as representatives from various people's organizations in the province and city. The meeting decided to launch "Thousand Yuan Movement" and "Hundred Yuan Movement" in all cities and vast rural areas of the province, and to further strengthen patriotic and internationalist education for the broad masses of the people through the collection of comfort and relief items. The Qingdao Municipal Consultative Committee and various people's organizations jointly issued a "Letter to All Compatriots in the City" on the 17th, calling on the people of the city to widely launch a voluntary donation campaign of comfort and relief items. As of mid-January, Shandong Province and Qingdao City had raised more than 457,780,000 yuan in RMB, more than 25,000 letters of sympathy, and a large number of comfort items such as sweaters, gloves, socks, soap, and medicines. More than 50 industries in Wuhu City's business community held meetings on the 16th and 17th respectively to discuss the launch of comfort and relief movements. Businessmen and industrialists voluntarily donated a total of 150 million yuan in RMB for comfort and relief on the spot. The city's business community also decided to launch a "One Household, One Letter" campaign.

[News from this newspaper] The Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression issued a notice on the 23rd regarding the collection of items to comfort Chinese and Korean soldiers and relieve Korean refugees. The notice briefly stated:

On December 23rd of last year, this committee sent the items (including 153,200 letters of sympathy, 77,970 comfort bags, 31,352 pairs of leather gloves, 52,128 towels, 8,171 pairs of socks, 36 watches, 439 pens, medicines, binoculars, compasses, sweaters, vests, toothpaste, soap, toothbrushes, tooth powder, diaries, pencils, and woolen underwear, etc., totaling 178,538 items) and comfort money (1.2 billion yuan) donated by people from all walks of life in the capital to the front lines. Based on the specific situation in our city and in response to the call of the General Association, this committee now decides:

1. All people's organizations, relief organizations, and government offices, factories, and schools in the city should immediately mobilize the masses to carry out this work on a voluntary basis.

2. Units that have not yet conducted a comfort item collection should conduct it simultaneously with the relief item collection.

3. Units that have already conducted widespread collection should decide whether to continue the collection based on the situation in their own unit.

4. In order to meet the needs of the soldiers at the front and the Korean refugees, this committee hopes that people from all walks of life will collect cash (including RMB and gold and silver jewelry). The committee entrusts the branches of the People's Bank of China to collect RMB and the Bank of China (Xijiaominxiang) to collect gold and silver jewelry.

5. All unsubmitted comfort items and newly collected comfort and relief items should be delivered to this committee at No. 2 Yuhe Bridge on February 1st and 2nd for prompt delivery to the front lines.
