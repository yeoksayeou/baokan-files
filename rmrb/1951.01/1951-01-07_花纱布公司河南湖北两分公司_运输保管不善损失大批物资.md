   Hua Sha Cloth Company's Henan and Hubei Branches
   Suffer Large Losses of Materials Due to Poor Transportation and Storage

Editor:
    In recent months, the Henan and Hubei branches of the China Hua Sha Cloth Company have suffered significant losses of materials due to poor transportation and storage. For example, in July of last year, when the Nanyang branch in Henan received tax cotton in Biyang, they hired fifty large carts to inspect the goods in Biyang without first understanding the situation. As a result, they waited for five days, followed by over twenty days of rain, which delayed the cotton's transportation by over a month and caused some of it to get wet. The total loss, including cart fees and damaged cotton, amounted to over 18 million yuan. On December 4th, the Nanyang branch received 224 bales of tax cotton from Xinye, which were loaded onto trucks in Xuchang for transport to Hankou. Five bales were lost along the way. After the district company discovered this during inspection, they called to investigate and found that the bales had fallen near Lujiashan Station, resulting in a loss of over 300 catties of cotton. In another instance, the Laohekou branch in Hubei used wooden boats to transport 162 bales of cotton and cotton yarn to Hankou in early November, but the boats ran aground at Majiazhou (the boats already had cracks, which were only sealed with cotton), resulting in the loss of twenty-three bales of cotton, and the salvaged cotton was also soaked in water. On December 16th, a fire broke out on a freight car transporting cotton from Luoyang to Shanghai in Zhengzhou, burning approximately 10,000 catties of cotton. The cotton that was not burned was either soaked in water or soiled with dirt.

    Storage and transportation are important links in the enterprise sector, related to the lifeline of the entire enterprise. Leaders and every comrade with specific responsibilities must attach great importance to them. Ideologically, we must clearly understand that cherishing state assets is not only the responsibility of economic workers, but also a matter of political understanding and political awareness.

    In response to the unfortunate incidents mentioned above, the Central South China Hua Sha Cloth Company has instructed its subordinate companies at all levels to learn from these accidents and be vigilant. It has also stipulated some precautions that should be taken in transportation and storage work. I believe that other regions should also pay attention to this.

### 花纱布公司河南湖北两分公司  运输保管不善损失大批物资

   花纱布公司河南湖北两分公司
   运输保管不善损失大批物资编辑同志：
    中国花纱布公司河南、湖北两省分公司，近几月来由于运输保管不善，造成了大批物资的损失。如去年七月间河南南阳分公司在泌阳接收赋棉时，预先没有了解情况，就雇了五十辆大车去泌阳验收，结果等了五天，又一连下了二十几天雨，使棉花迟运月余，并被雨淋湿了一部分。总计损失了车费、损坏棉花等共计一千八百多万元。十二月四日南阳分公司接收新野的赋棉二二四包，由许昌装车运汉，路上丢了五包，区公司验收发现后，打电话追查，结果发现掉落在陆家山站附近，损失棉花三百余斤。又如湖北老河口支公司于十一月初用木船装花一六二包及棉纱等运往汉口，结果在马家洲触滩覆没（本来船就有裂口，仅用棉花堵塞），结果损失了二十三包棉花，打捞起的也都被水浸湿。十二月十六日郑州又发生了由洛阳运往上海的棉花货车失火事件，烧毁棉花约一万斤，没有烧的也都被水淋湿或被土弄污了。
    储运工作是企业部门重要的一环，关系着整个企业的命脉，必须自领导上以至每个负具体责任的同志高度的重视，在思想上明确对国家资财的爱护，不仅是经济工作人员的责任问题，而且是一个政治认识和政治觉悟的问题。
    根据上述发生不幸事件，花纱布中南区公司已指示所属各级公司接受这些事故的教训，提高警惕。并规定了在运输保管工作中应该注意的一些事情。我认为其他地区对此也应该引起注意。
