Beijing Youth Students Enter Winter Vacation
Communist Youth League Municipal Committee and Municipal Student Federation Publish Letter to Students and League Members
Calling for Participation in Learning, Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Martyrs and Soldiers, and Recreational Activities

[Reported by this newspaper] Students in Beijing have entered the winter vacation of 1951. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Beijing Municipal Student Federation jointly issued a letter to all students and Communist Youth League members in the city, calling on them to spend a good winter vacation. The full text is as follows:

Comrades and Youth League members:

We have spent a victorious 1950 in joy. In the past year, the people of the whole country have united to build our great motherland, launched the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend our homeland, and set off a great upsurge of patriotism. On the Korean battlefield, we defeated US imperialism and reversed the world situation. In this year, we have more clearly realized that US imperialism is just a paper tiger, and that the power of the Chinese people and the people of the world can never be defeated. The winter vacation is coming, let us celebrate the great victory of the Chinese people by spending a good winter vacation!

Because students and Youth League members have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and actively participated in learning and propaganda work, our ideological awareness has been greatly improved. At the same time, due to the implementation of the spirit of the Beijing Municipal Youth League Congress resolution, League members have played a more active role, becoming the core of current affairs learning and propaganda work, and have closer ties with students. We have also gained some experience in the work of the League branch. We should consolidate and develop these achievements during the winter vacation.

Comrades and Youth League members, in order to spend a good winter vacation, let us pay attention to the following things:

First, participate in the youth lectures, film and drama performances held by the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Municipal Student Federation during the winter vacation. These will further enhance our understanding and develop patriotic ideas.

Second, during the Spring Festival, actively respond to the people's government's call for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers. Go to visit and comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers, especially the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are stationed in the most glorious posts and the families of students participating in military cadre schools, and pay tribute to them.

Third, make good use of the winter vacation to review your lessons well.

Fourth, organize recreational and sports activities that are beneficial to health and rest, exercise your body, and prepare to serve the country at any time to defend and build the motherland.

Fifth, every student, especially Youth League members, should recall the tremendous progress in their thinking in the past few months during the great historical process. How did you originally understand US imperialism, and how do you understand it now? How did you originally estimate the power of the people, and how do you estimate it now? Every Youth League member should further examine himself to see whether he has played an active role in all work and study. In this way, you will realize your progress and you will be a hundred times more confident to move forward.

Sixth, learn to arrange your life, ensure that you have a certain amount of time for reading newspapers and exercising every day, and gradually develop good living habits.

Seventh, Youth League members should not forget their exemplary role, and should unite students during the winter vacation to spend a good winter vacation together.

　　京市青年学生进入寒假
    团市委市学联发表告同学团员书
    号召参加学习、拥军优属及文娱等活动
    【本报讯】北京市的学生已进入一九五一年的寒假，青年团北京市委员会暨北京市学生联合会联合发表告全市同学与青年团员书，号召他们过好寒假。全文如下：同学们、青年团员们：
    我们在欢欣中度过了充满着胜利的一九五○年。过去一年中，全国人民团结一致建设着我们伟大的祖国，展开了抗美援朝保家卫国运动，掀起了伟大的爱国主义的高潮，在朝鲜战场上，打垮了美帝国主义，扭转了世界的局势。这一年中，我们更加清楚地认识了美帝是只纸老虎，认识了中国人民和世界人民的力量是永远不可能被战胜的。寒假来了，让我们以过好寒假生活来庆祝中国人民的伟大胜利吧！
    由于同学们和青年团员们在抗美援朝运动中发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，积极学习和参加宣传工作，使我们的思想觉悟大大提高。同时，由于京市团代大会决议精神的贯彻，使团员们更加发挥了积极作用，成为时事学习和宣传工作中的核心，更加密切了和同学们的联系，在团的支部工作上也取得了一些经验。我们在寒假中就应该巩固并发展这些成果。
    同学们、青年团员们，为了过好寒假生活，让我们注意下列几件事情：
    第一、参加寒假中团市委和市学联所举办的青年讲座、电影和戏剧演出。这些将会更加提高我们的认识，和发展爱国主义的思想。
    第二、在春节期间，要积极响应人民政府所号召的拥军优属运动。要去慰问烈、军属，特别要去慰问站在最光荣的岗位上的中国人民志愿军的家属和参加军事干部学校的同学们的家属，向他们致敬。
    第三、要利用寒假好好温习功课。
    第四、要组织有益于健康和休息的文娱体育活动，锻炼身体，准备随时为保卫和建设祖国而服务。
    第五、每一个同学，特别是青年团员要回忆一下几个月来，在伟大的历史进程中自己思想上的巨大进步。原来对美帝怎样认识，现在又怎样认识；原来对人民的力量如何估计，现在怎样估计。每个青年团员都应该进一步检讨一下自己，是否在一切工作和学习中发挥了积极作用。这样就会认识到自己的进步，就会信心百倍地更加走向进步。
    第六、要学会安排自己的生活，保证每天要有一定的读报和运动的时间，逐渐养成良好的生活习惯。
    第七、青年团员不要忘记自己的模范作用，要在寒假中团结同学共同过好寒假生活。
