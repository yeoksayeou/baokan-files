　　Tianjin Xinhua Bag Company
    Should Not Delay Paying Disaster Area Workers' Wages

Editor:

    Beicai Village, Fourth District, Wuqing County, Hebei Province, is a village that suffered from flooding last year. In order to respond to the government's call for production for self-salvation, the village head and the Communist Party branch secretary went to the Tianjin Xinhua Bag Company to undertake a batch of hemp stalks to bring back to the village, so that the women could spin thread as a form of work relief to help the disaster victims overcome their difficulties. At the beginning, the masses had very high confidence, and in less than half a month, 500 women participated. Each person could spin an average of four to five catties of hemp per day, which could solve the living problems of two or three people. Therefore, the masses said that this was a good method devised by the government and village cadres for the disaster victims.

    Unexpectedly, on November 16th of last year, an internal dispute suddenly occurred within the Xinhua Company, and the seven million yuan in wages for spinning hemp that should have been paid to Beicai Village was withheld and not released. At that time, the local government lent Beicai Village 6,200 catties of wheat to temporarily maintain the livelihoods of the hemp spinning workers. However, the Xinhua Company consistently used empty words such as "resolved in three to five days" and "resolved in the near future" to delay the repayment of wages. By December 10th, the village stopped work due to the depletion of raw materials. It is estimated that the Xinhua Company owes the village a total of more than 17 million yuan in hemp spinning wages. The workers went to the village head every day to ask for wages, which made the village head very embarrassed. Now the government is calling on disaster victims to engage in production for self-salvation, but the Xinhua Company is accumulating the wages of disaster victims and not paying them. This not only affects the production of the people in the disaster area, but also damages the government's prestige among the masses. It is hoped that the Tianjin Municipal People's Government can quickly investigate and handle this appropriately.

### 天津新华麻袋公司  不应拖欠灾区工人工资

　　天津新华麻袋公司
    不应拖欠灾区工人工资编辑同志：
    河北武清县第四区北蔡村是个去年遭受水灾的村子。为了响应政府生产自救的号召，该村村长和中共支部书记曾到天津新华麻袋公司，承接一批麻穰回到村里，让妇女们纺线，以工代赈，帮助灾民度过难关。开始时，群众信心非常高，不到半个月即有五百个妇女参加。每天每人平均能纺四、五斤麻，可以解决二、三个人的生活问题。因此群众都说这是政府和村干部为灾民想的好办法。
    不料至去年十一月十六日，新华公司内部突然发生纠纷，把应发给北蔡村的七百万元纺麻的工资压住了，没有发下来。当时就由当地政府借给北蔡村小麦六千二百斤，暂时维持纺麻工人的生活。但以后新华公司对发还工资一事始终用“三、五天解决”，“近期内解决”等空洞言词来拖延。至十二月十日，该村因原料纺完而停工。计前后新华公司共欠该村纺麻工人工资一千七百余万元。工人每天都找村长要工资，使该村村长很为难。现在政府正号召灾民生产自救，而新华公司却积压灾民工资不发，这样不但影响了灾区人民的生产，而且损害了政府在群众中的威信。希望天津市人民政府能迅速予以检查并作适当处理。
