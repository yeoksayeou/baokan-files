　　Two Capture Sixteen Alive
    Three days after a battle in a certain area of the western front in Korea, many American soldiers who had been routed were scattered in the valleys near the area. Communications soldiers Cui Daxing (Korean national) and Yu Peihai of a certain unit were ordered to go ahead to make contact with the vanguard unit. It was dusk at this time, and they walked more than half a kilometer along the road when they suddenly saw two people walking towards them. As soon as they saw them, they turned around and ran. They realized that these must be enemy stragglers, so they immediately fired two bursts of bullets. After a short silence, someone shouted from behind a pile of earth: "Hello! O.K.!" Cui Daxing vigilantly replied, "Hello! O.K.!" Then, four American soldiers, who had been hungry for three days, walked over with their hands on their heads. After Cui Daxing and Yu Peihai searched out three carbines and one pistol from behind the pile of earth, they escorted the four American soldiers to the unit.
    After handing over the prisoners, they set off to carry out their original mission. It was now pitch black, and they were even more careful and vigilant. After walking several kilometers, they found a detached house by the road. They wanted to ask a Korean old man to be their guide. Cui Daxing shouted to the house in Korean: "We are the People's Army, please guide us." The people inside the house replied: "There are no old people, we are also the People's Army." When Cui Daxing heard that it was not the accent of North Korea, he estimated that there were enemies in the house. So he continued to shout: "Turn on the lights quickly!" There was a commotion in the house, and two people opened the back door and ran towards the mountain.
    One of them monitored the enemies in the house, and the other fired a burst of shots at the enemies who were running away. Cui Daxing then shouted to the enemy lying on the hillside because of the gunfire: "We have a company deployed all around, if you don't surrender, we will shoot again!" Then, an enemy clapped his hands and walked over. He said: "I am the Korean interpreter of the U.S. military. There are twelve more American soldiers in the house, and they all have guns." Yu Peihai was on guard with his gun aside, while Cui Daxing said to the Korean interpreter: "Don't be afraid. But you shouldn't help the American bandits to kill your compatriots again!" He then ordered him: "Tell the American soldiers quickly that the Chinese People's Volunteers treat prisoners leniently, they will not be killed if they surrender their guns, and there is food to eat." The guy immediately shouted to the American soldiers in the house in English. The American soldiers, who were starving and flustered, heard that they would not be killed if they surrendered their guns and that there was food to eat, so they walked out of the house one by one with their hands raised. Another Rhee Syngman puppet army translator lying on the hillside also walked over. They seized a total of twelve carbines, two automatic rifles and two pistols.
    Cui Daxing ordered the two Korean translators to lead the way in front of the American soldiers, while he and Yu Peihai walked at the back with their guns to supervise them. On the way, the enemy saw that there were only two of them and asked: "Why hasn't your team come yet?" Cui Daxing replied very vigilantly: "Our team is deployed on the top of the mountain, you have already surrendered, so they don't need to come down." When they reached the road, they met the guard company of their own unit and handed over the prisoners to them.
    The deeds of Cui Daxing and Yu Peihai, who captured sixteen American soldiers and two Rhee puppet army translators alive in less than four hours, were commended by the leaders of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The notice called on all commanders and fighters of the regiment to learn from their vigilant, flexible, daring, and heroic fighting style. [Xinhua News Agency]

　　两个活捉十六个
    在朝鲜西线的某地战斗后的第三天，许多美国溃兵逃散在该地附近的山谷中。某部通讯员崔大兴（朝鲜籍）和于佩海奉命到前面去与先头部队取得联络。这时已是黄昏时刻，他们顺着公路走了一里多路，蓦然看见迎面走来的两个人，一见他们，回头就跑。他们意识到这一定是敌人的散兵，于是立即打出了两排子弹。一个短时的沉默之后，有人在土堆后面喊道：“哈啰！Ｏ·Ｋ！”崔大兴就机警地随声回答：“哈啰！Ｏ·Ｋ！”接着，饿了三天的四个美国兵，两手抱着头走了过来。崔大兴和于佩海在那土堆后面搜出了三支卡宾枪一支短枪之后，把这四个美国兵押送到部队。
    他们交了俘虏以后，又出发执行原来的任务。这时已是大黑夜，他们更加小心警惕。两人走了几里路后，发现路旁有个独立房子。他们想请一个朝鲜老百姓当向导，崔大兴对着房子用朝鲜话喊着：“我们是人民军，请你们带带路。”屋内的人却回答道：“没有老百姓，我们也是人民军。”崔大兴一听不是朝鲜北部的话音，就估计屋里是敌人。于是，他继续喊着：“快点灯！”屋子里随即嘈杂了一阵，有两个人打开后门，往山上跑去了。
    他们一个人监视房子里的敌人，一个人向逃跑的敌人打了一排枪。崔大兴接着对因遭到枪击而伏在山坡上的敌人喊道：“我们有一个连都在周围布置好了，再不投降，又要开枪了！”于是，一个敌人拍着手走了过来，他说：“我是美军的朝鲜翻译官。屋里还有十二个美国兵，他们都有枪。”于佩海端着枪在一旁警戒，崔大兴则对着这个朝鲜翻译官说：“你不要害怕。但你不该再帮美国强盗来杀害自己的同胞！”他接着命令他说：“你快对美国兵说，中国人民志愿军宽待俘虏，缴枪不杀，还有饭吃。”那家伙就立即用英文向屋内的美国兵喊起来。那些饿得发慌的美国兵，听说缴枪不杀，又有饭吃，就一个个举着双手，从屋里走了出来。另一个伏在山坡上的李承晚伪军的翻译也走过来了。他们一共缴下了十二支卡宾枪、两支自动步枪和两支短枪。
    崔大兴命令两个朝鲜翻译走在美国兵头前领路，自己和于佩海则端着枪走在最后监视着。在路上，敌人看见只有他们两个人，就问道：“你们的队伍怎么还不来呢？”崔大兴很机警地回答说：“我们的队伍都布置在山顶上，你们已经投降，他们就不用下来了。”走到公路上，他们碰见了自己部队的警卫连，才把这些俘虏交给他们。
    崔大兴和于佩海两个人在不到四个钟头内，活捉了十六个美国兵和两个李伪军翻译官的事迹，获得中国人民志愿军某团首长的通报嘉奖。通报中号召全团指战员学习他们这种机警、灵活、独胆、英勇的战斗作风。【新华社】
