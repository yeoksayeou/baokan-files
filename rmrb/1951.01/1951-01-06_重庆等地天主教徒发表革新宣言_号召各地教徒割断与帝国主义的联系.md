Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 5th: Six hundred and ninety-five people, including Shi Mingliang, acting bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Chongqing, and Liu Zongyu, chief secretary of the bishop's office, issued a declaration for the self-reliance and reform movement. The declaration called on Catholics in various places to support the Common Program, completely sever ties with imperialists, and implement the principles of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

In the nearly hundred-year history of our country, the aggression of imperialists and a series of unequal treaties have been like chains around the necks of the Chinese people, plunging China into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal status. Imperialists used religion as a tool to invade China, using the privilege of freely preaching in China, and using churches and the hospitals and schools they ran as shields, to carry out espionage and sabotage activities in the Chinese mainland, and to lure a portion of ignorant people with petty favors to serve them in order to achieve their aggressive schemes.

Now the entire Chinese people have stood up, and we Catholics have also clearly recognized that the church, which has been used by imperialists, is not only a major obstacle to China's path to independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity; and according to the facts of missionaries in Shijiazhuang and other places carrying out espionage activities, it proves that the originally pure church is in fact stained with the bloody deeds of imperialist murderers. We Catholics, in order to love our motherland, firmly stand on the position of the Chinese people, support the Common Program, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, completely sever all kinds of ties with imperialists, implement the principles of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation of the Chinese Catholic Church, and strive to consolidate world lasting peace and build an independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous New China.

Catholic friends in the Chongqing area and various places, we must raise our vigilance, strengthen our learning, expose the historical facts of imperialists using the Catholic Church to invade China, eliminate elements within the church who are willing to serve imperialism, thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialism, and strive to achieve the goal of self-reliance in the shortest possible time.

Initiators: Shi Mingliang, acting bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Chongqing; Liu Zongyu, chief secretary of the bishop's office; Luo Beizhan, priest of Zhenyuan Church; Chen Guangpu, Liu Renhui, and Chen Shuzhong, priests of Ruose Church; Yu Xuelian, priest of Zengjiayan Catholic Church; Yang Pengzhou, priest of Jing Shu Ju; Xia Jinxian, priest of Jiangbei Catholic Church; Tang Yuanlin, Wang Xiaoci, Yi Shiyu, Li Zhizhi, and Huang Gongmao, priests of Cimu Mountain Seminary; male monk Lu Dao; Zhu Yaofang, Chen Xianggui, Ding Zhide, Liu Changyi, Wang Pu, Song Peifeng, and Dong Zongfeng, nuns of the Sacred Heart Church, all of the above are Chinese missionaries; Catholics who signed up to participate in the initiation include Yang Lida, Tang Heqin, Lu Binqing, Cao Liangren, Zhou Qingtian, Liu Huasheng, Yang Qisheng, Yu Jibo, Tang Jingchuan, Jia Xudong, Xing Jintang, Liu Taisheng, Tong Shulin, Fu Tingbi, Wei Longzhang, Xiong Bocang, Luo Yaoxun, Yi Chunyi, Zheng Shiyou, Chen Shuxun, Wang Pu, Liu Wenliang, Tang Shaoyu, etc., totaling six hundred and ninety-five people.

[Our Newspaper] As the movement to resist America and aid Korea continues to deepen, Catholic priests and church representatives Deng Bingxian, Zhang Bolu, Sun Yuezhu, Yang Hong, Wang Yi, Chen Xinmin, Peng Zejiang, Hu Ruojing, Hong Rongfang, and Yan Yidao in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, as well as Jiajiang County in western Sichuan and Yuechi County in northern Sichuan, have successively issued religious reform declarations and collected signatures from Catholics in various places on the declarations.

　　重庆等地天主教徒发表革新宣言
    号召各地教徒割断与帝国主义的联系
    【新华社重庆五日电】重庆市天主教教区代理主教石明亮、主教公署主任秘书刘宗渔等六百九十五人发表自立革新运动宣言。宣言中号召各地天主教徒拥护共同纲领，彻底割断与帝国主义者之间的联系，实行自治、自养、自传的方针。宣言全文如下：
    在我国近百年史上，帝国主义者的侵略，一连串的不平等条约如像锁链一样加在中国人民的颈上，把中国陷溺在半殖民地半封建的地位。帝国主义者利用宗教作侵略中国的工具，借着在华自由传教的特权，以教会及其所办的医院、学校为护符，在中国内地进行间谍破坏活动，并以小恩小惠诱惑一部分无知的人士为它服务，以达到其侵略的阴谋。
    现在全中国人民已经站起来了，我们天主教徒也明确地认识了为帝国主义者利用的教会，不但是我们中国走向独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的一大妨碍；并且根据石家庄等地传教士进行间谍活动的事实，证明了本来是纯洁的教会，事实上已沾满了帝国主义者杀人的血腥。我们天主教徒为了爱祖国，坚决站稳中国人民的立场，拥护共同纲领，反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，彻底割断与帝国主义者之间的各种联系，实行中国天主教会自治、自养、自传的方针，为巩固世界持久和平，建设独立、民主、统一、富强的新中国而奋斗。
    重庆区及各地天主教友们，我们要提高警惕，加强学习，揭露历来帝国主义利用天主教会侵略中国的阴谋事实，清除教会内部甘为帝国主义服务的分子，彻底肃清帝国主义的影响，力求于最短期间内实现自力更生的目标。
