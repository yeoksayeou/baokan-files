Japanese Day Laborers Fight for the Right to Live

The struggle of Japanese day laborers for their rights has recently intensified. Workers are subjected to cruel exploitation and are in a state of extreme misery and despair. They demand increased wages, reduced taxes, and that all day laborers have work.

Day laborers in various places have held demonstrations despite the strict suppression by the police. In a demonstration in Kyoto, three hundred police officers attacked the demonstrators. A demonstration in Nagoya was dispersed by one hundred and sixty police officers. Mass demonstrations were held in Tokyo, Yokohama, and other areas. Approximately three thousand day laborers participated in the Tokyo demonstration. Four companies of the "Police Reserve Force" were dispatched to suppress the demonstration.

Day laborers in Hakodate, Hokkaido, recently held a conference demanding that the Hakodate Municipal Government increase wages and dismiss the city's police chief. However, they were dispersed by the police.

Japanese War Industry Produces Weapons for U.S. Imperialism

The United States is using the Japanese war industry that it fostered to manufacture weapons of murder. According to a United Press dispatch, the Ooe factory of the Nagoya Works of the Central Japan Heavy Industries Corporation is busy manufacturing incendiary bombs. The Nagasaki Precision Machinery Factory of the "West Japan Heavy Industries Corporation," which possesses facilities and technology for manufacturing torpedoes, is said to be starting the manufacture of rocket shells recently. Mr. Kusunoki, a former naval torpedo authority designer at the Kure Naval Factory in Japan, has been hired by the factory. "Central Japan Heavy Industries Corporation" and "West Japan Heavy Industries Corporation" were both spun off from the pre-war "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Corporation."
