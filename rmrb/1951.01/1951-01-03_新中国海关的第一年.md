　　The First Year of New China's Customs
    Kong Yuan
    "Imperialism has been driven out of China, and many of the privileges of imperialism in China have been abolished. The customs policy and foreign trade policy of New China have become important tools for protecting the development of New China's industry. This means that we have put the key to China's gate in our own pockets, instead of, as in the past, in the pockets of the imperialists and their running dogs. From now on, Chinese industry will not be subject to competition from cheap goods from imperialism, and China's raw materials will first be used to supply its own industrial needs. This removes one of the biggest obstacles that have prevented the development of Chinese industry for a hundred years." - Liu Shaoqi
    (I) Putting the Key to China's Gate in Our Own Pockets
    The past year of 1950 was a year in which the Chinese people achieved great victories and rapid progress in politics, military affairs, finance and economics, culture and education. For customs work, it was a year of fundamental change and laying the foundation. For the first time in a hundred years, the Chinese people have grasped the key to China's gate nationwide, not allowing those imperialist aggressors to interfere with and control it, and not wanting those "foreign customs commissioner lords" to overstep their bounds and take over. The Chinese people themselves have the say, managing the national customs and realizing customs autonomy. The old customs, which had been under the long-term control of American and British imperialism, have perished along with the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. The new China's customs has begun to be built, which is one of the signs of the fundamental transformation of China's politics and economy.
    On January 27, 1950, the State Council of the Central People's Government, in accordance with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman Mao's fundamental policy on new democratic economic construction, passed the "Decision on Customs Policy and Customs Work." This decision is of great historical significance. It correctly stipulates the general direction of New China's customs policy and tariff policy and the specific methods and paths for realizing this direction. It clearly points out that "Under the current conditions, the supervision and certain control carried out by the state customs work and foreign trade work should play an important role in the restoration and development of our people's economy. Customs tariffs must protect national production and must protect the competition between domestic products and foreign goods." "The General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government must be a unified, centralized, independent, and autonomous state organ responsible for carrying out actual supervision and management of the import and export of various goods and currencies, collecting tariffs, and fighting smuggling, in order to protect our country from economic aggression by capitalist countries." For this reason, it is stipulated that customs organization reform must be implemented, duties unrelated to customs must be removed, and new customs tariffs and new customs regulations must be formulated.
    Over the past year, the General Administration of Customs and the new and old cadres and staff of customs across the country have followed the above-mentioned policies of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, and the instructions of the State Council and its Financial and Economic Committee, and have carried out a lot of work and achieved preliminary results.
            (II) Reforming and Building the Customs Organization
    In the early days of the establishment of the General Administration of Customs in Beijing, the national customs was generally in a state of regional decentralization. Except for the customs in the old liberated areas of the Northeast, the customs in other regions were taken over separately by the local senior people's governments or military control committees during the liberation. This decentralized management method was necessary under the wartime situation at the time. However, since the establishment of the Central People's Government, foreign trade has been increasingly developed, and customs work has gone beyond the scope of local areas, it is necessary to change this decentralized management method. Therefore, first of all, a new, unified, centralized, independent, and autonomous General Administration of Customs was established, and various organizational regulations and detailed rules for handling affairs were stipulated to lay a preliminary foundation for establishing a new organizational system for leading the national customs. Then, it gradually took over the customs in Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places, and sent personnel to inspect South China and other places. By May of this year, all customs across the country had established contact with the General Administration and were directly led by the General Administration. Due to the special circumstances of the customs in South China and Northeast China, in addition to being directly under the General Administration and directly led by the General Administration, the South China Customs Office and the Northeast Customs Administration were temporarily retained as representative organs of the General Administration to strengthen leadership and solve some special local issues nearby.
    The old Chinese customs was almost entirely established according to unequal treaties, and obeyed the economic aggression of imperialist countries. As a result of the excessive opening of treaty ports, there were nominally checkpoints everywhere, but in reality, the gates were wide open. Now that we have restored the independence and autonomy of the customs, we should make appropriate adjustments to the location of customs establishments across the country according to the needs of our people's economic development. In this year, the General Administration of Customs abolished four independent customs, namely Chongqing, Jinling, Wafangdian, and Longzhou, and some branch offices. According to the "Instructions on the Principles of Establishing Customs and Adjusting the National Customs Organization" recently promulgated by the State Council, the national customs and its branch offices will be reduced from the original 173 to 70. This is a major change in the customs organization.
    We have formulated the "General Rules for Local Customs Organizations and the Provisional Plan for the Establishment of Each Customs," and the local customs have carried out internal organizational reorganization work based on this plan. The so-called "foreign personnel" problem has been solved, and the system of foreign customs commissioners and general customs commissioners has been completely abolished. The maritime and port affairs work that is not related to customs duties has been lifted, and the phenomenon of the great customs that encompasses everything has been overcome. In addition, many unreasonable phenomena in the customs organizational structure and internal division of labor have been basically corrected. The experience since the trial implementation of the organizational regulations of the General Administration of Customs has proved that the new organizational form is suitable for the functions and tasks of the new customs.
    In addition, it must be pointed out that although some of the methods of the old customs' personnel system can be used for reference, in essence, it is a systematic, cunning, sophisticated, ferocious, and vicious method used by imperialists against colonies. Its special high salary treatment system is even more contrary to the level of China's socio-economic life. After the establishment of the General Administration of Customs, the old personnel system was fundamentally criticized. Many unreasonable phenomena in the salary and treatment of the old customs have been abolished. Local customs have made progress in transforming the erroneous thoughts such as "super-political" and "worshiping Britain and the United States" that remain among employees through study. Customs in Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Kowloon, and other places have launched an anti-corruption movement against the corrupt style of the old customs personnel before liberation, and have achieved certain results. The General Administration also issued four interim measures for the appointment and removal, leave, transfer, and probation of customs employees to unify the personnel work of each customs: The "Instructions on Establishing a Customs Performance Appraisal System" was promulgated, and the unreasonable secret performance appraisal system of the old customs was abolished.
    Although the new customs organizational system has been initially established and is gradually moving towards unification, some cadres do not have a clear understanding of the importance of customs organizational reform, or there are still some incorrect decentralized thoughts on the principle of unified centralization, which must be overcome.
            (III) Establishing and Unifying Business Systems
    The nature and functions of the customs have undergone profound and significant changes, and therefore the customs business system must also change accordingly. Therefore, establishing and unifying the business system of the new customs is an extremely important link in successfully completing the task. The General Administration of Customs deeply feels the importance of this work to reforming the old customs and building the new customs. Over the past year, it has concentrated its main efforts on drafting the customs law and the new tariff, and has promulgated a number of important regulations.
    The old Chinese customs existed for nearly a century, and there has never been a basic customs law. Everything was done according to the orders of the customs general tax supervisor, an agent of imperialism. After the establishment of the General Administration of Customs, it planned to draft customs laws and regulations. On January 27 this year, the decision of the State Council more clearly stipulated that the General Administration of Customs is responsible for completing the draft within a limited time. We established a special committee on customs laws and regulations in February. After four months of careful research, we completed the first draft in June. After discussion at the National Customs Affairs Conference, and after repeated revisions, sorting, and reviewing by the General Administration, it is now being reviewed by a special group of the State Council. The basic basis for our formulation of the draft customs law is the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the decision of the State Council on customs policy and customs work. It specifically embodies the policies of the new Chinese customs, summarizes the work experience of the national customs, and clearly and systematically stipulates the organization, tasks, powers, and unified and consistent customs working methods of the new customs institutions. It stipulates the responsibilities and obligations of general state organs, transportation departments, social organizations, and private individuals engaged in foreign trade for complying with customs regulations, and the mutual relations between customs and them. We firmly believe that the implementation of this customs law will bring the national customs work to a new stage.
    Regarding the compilation of the new tariff, under the auspices of the Tariff Commission, based on the basic principles stipulated by Zhengwuyuan that customs tariffs must protect national production, must protect the competition between domestic products and foreign goods, and use two different tax rates depending on whether there is a trade treaty or agreement relationship with our country, after half a year of effort, investigation and research on the comparative prices of Chinese and foreign goods, the domestic and foreign production and sales situation, and in consultation with the relevant departments of the Central Committee, a preliminary draft was completed at the end of July. After repeated review and revision, it was finalized in November and is now being submitted for review. This new tariff will be China's first truly independent and autonomous protectionist and nationally unified customs tariff.
    In addition, the General Administration of Customs has promulgated many important separate measures based on necessity and possibility, such as: Interim measures for customs handling of overdue declarations, overdue payments, and overdue unpaid import goods, interim measures for customs review of tax classification and valuation appeals, measures for preferential tax exemptions for luggage and items carried by returned overseas Chinese, and interim measures for customs anti-smuggling reward reserve funds. There are also various methods for stopping domestic parcel inspection, etc., which are about to be promulgated and implemented. The old business system is basically not applicable. Before the promulgation of the new customs law and new tariff, although the publication of these new measures has initially solved some business problems, it is still far behind the needs of the work.
            (IV) Implementing Cargo Supervision
    According to statistics from January to October of this year, imported goods nationwide accounted for 43.06% of the total value of import and export trade. National export goods accounted for 56.94% of the total value of import and export trade. The trade surplus accounted for 32.23% of the total import value. Looking at it from the perspective of public and private economic components, from January to October, state-owned enterprises accounted for 54.38% of export trade, and private enterprises accounted for 45.62%. State-owned enterprises accounted for 69.94% of import trade, and private enterprises accounted for 30.06%. The main export commodities are soybeans, tung oil, bristles, peanuts, wool, egg products, tea, and mineral sands. The main import commodities are production equipment, industrial raw materials, especially cotton is the largest. This shows that since the establishment of the Central People's Government, the national public and private foreign trade has been increasingly restored and developed. The long-term trade deficit situation in old China has undergone major changes. As Director Chen Yun said: "The semi-colonial foreign trade has been changed to protection trade. Foreign goods that are not needed by the Chinese national economy have stopped being imported, and the surplus agricultural products and agricultural by-products in the country are exported to the maximum extent under the principle of protecting farmers rather than exploiting them. The era of trade deficits and foreign exchange debts for a hundred years has also completely changed since 1950."
    The fundamental policy of New China's economic policy and customs policy determines that the nature and functions of the new customs are different from those of a purely tax collection agency. It should first be the state's supervisory agency - implementing actual supervision over the import and export of goods. Its task is to implement supervision and management of all public and private import and export goods in accordance with the policies and laws of the Central People's Government on foreign trade control. Over the past year, although many difficulties have arisen in the execution of cargo supervision tasks by the customs, for example, some places do not recognize the necessity of this supervision, or even think it is superfluous and express dissatisfaction, customs in various places have overcome many difficulties and have begun to establish cargo supervision work. It can basically carry out work with emphasis, distinguishing between priorities, distinguishing between objects, and combining the specific local conditions, in accordance with the national foreign trade control policy and the regulations and instructions of the General Administration of Customs, in order to implement actual supervision tasks. However, in terms of handling procedures, due to the overlapping internal agencies of the old customs and the detailed division of labor, it takes more than 20 procedures from the declaration of imported goods to the release, making the general public feel that "it is difficult to pass customs." After liberation, customs in various places began to reform the unreasonable systems, regulations, and complicated procedures in the past, but because the new and old customs personnel are either accustomed to using the old systems and working methods for a long time, or are not familiar with customs business and are not good at combining the central policies with the specific customs business, the unreasonable supervision system and complicated handling procedures still need to be further reformed.
            (V) Collecting Customs Duties
    The basic task of the new customs' tax collection work is to correctly implement the customs policy and use the tax rate to protect our country's production. This is a weapon for foreign economic struggle and also one of the state's important financial revenues. When carrying out tax collection work, our customs staff must first ensure the correct implementation of the customs policy; secondly, we must vigorously prevent smuggling and tax evasion, underreporting of prices, and other phenomena to ensure the completion of the specified tax collection tasks; and thirdly, we must ensure that the tax payment is promptly submitted to the state treasury. In the past year, in terms of tax revenue, due to the successive liberation of coastal islands, the blockade threat in East China and South China was once relaxed, and the import of materials suddenly became strong. As of the end of November, national customs revenue has preliminarily completed 144.47% of the estimated annual task. Tax revenues from various customs have been promptly transferred to the treasury, and tax revenue figures can be reported regularly.
    Before the new unified import and export tariff schedule has been promulgated and implemented, partial corrections have been made to the existing old import and export tariff schedule, such as in order to support domestic production and construction and ensure the supply of raw materials, reduce production costs, and allow tax exemptions for imported foreign cotton in the event of insufficient domestic cotton. Tax exemptions are also granted for special projects such as agricultural insecticides, experimental equipment, and scientific instruments. The tax rates on imported raw materials such as fine foreign yarn and soft foreign yarn used in the drawnwork industry have been reduced. In order to protect the industry, the tax rates on iron nails, wind lamps, etc. have been increased.
    In addition, it is worth mentioning that the national customs warehouse material clearing work has been mostly completed from May to the end of October this year. All the cleared materials are now ready, with a total value of RMB 31,788,503,478 yuan. Due to the implementation of streamlining and thrift, the tax revenue of various customs has increased and expenditures have decreased. The expenditures of the national customs have been reduced from 20% of the total customs revenue before liberation to 5%. The annual expenditure is initially reviewed by major administrative regions and paid on behalf of the central government, except for the Tianjin Customs, which is directly supplied by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government. Now we have studied and decided with the Ministry of Finance that, starting in 1951, the expenses of customs across the country except in the Northeast will be uniformly allocated by this department. This is an important and necessary measure for unifying finance.
            (VI) Fighting Smuggling
    Suppressing smuggling is one of the three major tasks of the people's customs. According to statistics from January to September of this year, the total value of smuggled goods seized by customs across the country accounted for 4.3% of the tax revenue during the same period, which is a great achievement. Among them, the smuggled goods seized by the three customs of Kowloon, Guangzhou, and Gongbei in South China exceeded half of all smuggled goods. The main smuggled imported goods are metal products, western medicines, seafood, dyes, paper, chemicals, etc.; the main smuggled exported goods are gold and silver, animals and animal products, rice, cotton textiles, silk fabrics, etc. In addition, customs such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shantou have cracked down on cases of tax evasion and violations of regulations by falsely reporting, exchanging foreign exchange, and avoiding the heavier duty when inspecting and evaluating goods. Shanghai Customs discovered cases of falsely reporting sailing to customs locations and actually sailing ships to be liberated areas, and has strengthened supervision in terms of management and technology.
    Although customs across the country have achieved many results in anti-smuggling work, smuggling still exists seriously. The blockade along the border and the coast is not strict enough, and there are many shortcomings in anti-smuggling work methods. In particular, South China is still the most serious area for smuggling today. Taking water passenger smuggling as an example, it has become a major problem in import and export control in South China. Some customs cannot correctly implement the anti-smuggling policy of distinguishing between priorities, distinguishing between objects, and combining punishment and education in specific work. As a result, in some places, excessive emphasis on punishment has aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, while in other places, there is an inappropriate emphasis on leniency, which actually allows smuggling. On the other hand, the serious corruption style of the old customs has not been completely eliminated. For example, among the 800 or so people in Guangzhou Customs, 160 people have still committed corruption after liberation, which has greatly affected the smooth implementation of anti-smuggling work.
            (VII) New Prospects and New Efforts
    Although the national customs work over the past year has achieved the above results due to the correct leadership of the central government and the united cooperation and concerted efforts of the new and old cadres; but the work of building a new people's customs is only just beginning. The current situation requires us to adhere to the State Council's policy that "the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government must be a unified, centralized, and independent national institution," and to quickly implement the customs law and the new tariff, formulate the regulations stipulated in the customs law, strengthen ideological and political education, improve political and business levels, especially to practice a clean, simple, and revolutionary work style of serving the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, oppose bureaucratic work style that is divorced from the masses, and cultivate new-style customs staff. In the future, the General Administration of Customs must gradually shift the focus of work to strengthening assistance and leadership to the national actual business, further strengthen the work connection with the local customs, understand the business situation of the national customs, convene a number of necessary professional meetings, unify the business system from all aspects, improve the work style, and correct the shortcomings in the work in order to complete the tasks entrusted to us by the Central People's Government.
    China's economy must gradually avoid the past state of anarchy and be more planned, and must realize the "strive to formulate a general plan for restoring and developing the main sectors of the national public and private economy as soon as possible" stipulated in the Common Program. As a state administrative organ, the customs should play an important role in the cause of restoring and developing the national economy and truly become an important tool for protecting the development of New China's industry. The phenomenon of unclear understanding of the nature and functions of the new Chinese customs and its important role should be clarified. The attitude of disgust and dissatisfaction with the old Chinese customs, which has long served imperialist economic aggression, is completely correct, and it is completely necessary to oppose the special thoughts of the old great customs, but it is necessary to prevent another extreme bias, such as denying the role and significance of today's customs in our national administrative work and new democratic economic construction, and not understanding that the nature and functions of the new Chinese customs have undergone fundamental changes, so that it is not cherished and helped, but continues to adopt an opposing attitude, which is wrong and harmful.
    It must be understood that for a hundred years, the key to China's gate has been placed in the pockets of the imperialists and their running dogs. Our people's economy and national economy and people's livelihood have suffered greatly because of this. Now, due to the victory of the people's great revolution, we have seized it back and put it in our own pockets. We should know how to cherish it, manage it well, and make it truly play an important role. The imperialists and their agents are not happy that China has an independent and autonomous customs. Just as they had predicted that the financial and economic difficulties of New China could not be overcome, they also predicted that the Chinese customs would not be able to operate without them and would collapse. They advocated how well the old customs were run by foreign tax commissioners, "even all countries in the world praised it," and promoted how bad the new customs was, without order, and without appearance, doing their best to ridicule. The last term and the last pseudo-general tax supervisor of the old customs, Li Du - the agent of American imperialism to control the Chinese customs, had sent letters and telegrams from Hong Kong, Taiwan and other places to entice customs personnel "As long as you swear not to work for the Communist Customs, I will give you money and send you a pension," doing everything possible to provoke and sabotage. But over the past year, the achievements of New China's customs have given a powerful counterattack to the enemy's humble and shameless conspiracy. Thanks to the joint efforts of all the new and old cadres and staff, united under the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China headed by Chairman Mao, we have overcome many difficulties and are building an independent and autonomous New China's customs.

　　新中国海关的第一年
    孔原
    “帝国主义已经从中国赶走，帝国主义在中国的许多特权已经被取消，新中国的海关政策与对外贸易政策已经成为保护新中国工业发展的重要工具。这就是说，我们已把中国大门的钥匙放在自己的袋子里，而不是如过去一样放在帝国主义及其走狗的袋子里。从今以后，中国工业就不致受到帝国主义的廉价商品的竞争，中国的原料将首先供给自己工业的需要。这就扫除了一百年来使中国工业不能发展的一个最大的障碍。”——刘少奇
    （一）把中国大门的钥匙放在自己袋子里
    过去的一九五○年是中国人民在政治、军事、财政经济、文化教育诸方面获得伟大胜利和飞速进步的一年，对于海关工作来说，这是根本变革和奠定基础的一年。百年来中国人民第一次在全国范围内掌握了中国大门的钥匙，不许那些帝国主义侵略者干涉控制，不要那些“洋人税务司老爷”们越俎代庖，由我们中国人民自己作主，管理了全国的海关，实现了关税自主权。受美英帝国主义长期控制的旧海关，已随着半封建半殖民地的旧中国而一起灭亡，新中国的海关已开始建设起来，这是中国政治经济根本转变的标志之一。
    一九五○年一月二十七日，中央人民政府政务院根据人民政协共同纲领和毛主席关于新民主主义经济建设的根本方针，通过了“关于关税政策和海关工作的决定”。这个决定具有重大的历史意义，它正确地规定了新中国的海关政策和关税政策的总方向和实现这一方向的具体方法道路，明确地指出“在目前条件下，国家海关工作与对外贸易工作上所进行的监督与某种管制，在恢复与发展我国人民经济中，应起重要的作用，海关税则必需保护国家生产，必需保护国内生产品与外国商品的竞争”。“中央人民政府海关总署，必须是统一集中的独立自主的国家机关，负责对各种货物及货币的输入输出执行实际的监督管理，征收关税，与走私进行斗争，以此来保护我国不受资本主义国家的经济侵略”。为此，规定：必须实行海关组织的改革，解除各项与海关无关的职务，制定新的海关税则和新的海关法规。
    一年来，海关总署和全国海关新老干部人员，就是遵循着上述中央人民政府毛主席的方针，政务院及其财政经济委员会的指示，进行了许多工作，获得了初步成绩。
            （二）海关组织的改革和建设
    海关总署在北京成立的初期，全国海关一般尚处在地区性的分散状态中，除东北老解放区各关外，其余各地海关，都是在解放时先后由各地高级人民政府或军管会分别接管，这种分散管理的方法，在当时战争情况下是必要的。但自中央人民政府成立后，对外贸易日益开展，海关工作已超出局部地方性的范围，就必须改变这种分散管理的方法。因此曾经首先把一个新的统一集中独立自主的海关总署建立起来，规定各项组织条例办事细则，为领导全国海关建立新的组织制度奠定初步的基础。然后，逐步接管天津、上海、青岛、烟台各地海关，派员赴华南等地视察。至今年五月，全国各关即已与总署建立联系，由总署直接领导，华南、东北两地区海关因情况特殊，除同样直隶总署，受总署直接领导外，并暂时保留华南海关处、东北海关管理局，作为总署的代表机关，以加强领导，并就近解决若干纯属地方性的特殊问题。
    旧中国海关几乎都是根据不平等条约，服从帝国主义国家经济侵略而设立的；由于滥行开放通商口岸的结果，以致形式上到处关卡林立，而实际上是门户洞开。现在我们既已恢复海关的独立自主权，自应根据我国人民经济发展的需要，将全国设关地点，予以适当的调整。在这一年中，海关总署撤销了重庆、金陵、瓦房店、龙州四个独立关和一些分支关所。根据政务院最近颁布的“关于设立海关原则和调整全国海关机构的指示”，全国海关及其分支机构，将由原有的一七三处缩减为七十处。这是海关组织的一大变革。
    我们规定了“地方海关组织通则与各关编制暂行方案”，各地海关均根据这一方案进行了内部组织的整编工作。解决了所谓“洋员”问题，完全取消了洋人税务司与总税务司制度；解除了与海关职务无关的海务港务工作，克服大海关主义包揽一切的现象；并基本上改正了海关组织机构与内部分工上许多不合理的现象。海关总署组织条例试行以来的经验证明，新的组织形式是适合于新海关的职能和任务的。
    此外必须指出：旧海关的人事制度，虽然某些方法可资参考，但本质上，它是帝国主义者对殖民地所用的一套有系统的狡猾精细而凶恶毒辣的办法。其特殊的高薪待遇制度，更与中国社会经济生活水平背道而驰。海关总署成立后，对旧的一套人事制度给予了根本的批判。取消了旧海关薪给待遇方面许多不合理的现象。各地海关对员工中残存的“超政治”、“崇拜英美”等错误思想，通过学习，有步骤地进行改造，一般有了进步。上海、厦门、广州、九龙等关，针对解放前旧海关人员中贪污腐化的作风，开展了反贪污运动，都收到一定成绩。总署并颁发海关员工任免、请假、调遣、试用等四个暂行办法，以统一各关人事工作：颁布“关于建立海关考绩鉴定制度的指示”，取消了旧海关不合理的密报考绩制度。
    新的海关组织制度虽已初步建立逐渐走向统一，但在一部分干部中对于海关组织改革的重要性认识不清，或对于统一集中的原则尚存在一些不正确的分散思想，还须加以克服。
            （三）建立和统一业务制度
    海关的性质和职能已发生了深刻而重大的变化，从而海关的业务制度亦必然要随之发生变革。因此建立和统一新海关的业务制度，是顺利完成任务的一个极重要的环节。海关总署深深感到这项工作对改革旧海关建设新海关的重要性，一年来，集中主要力量，从事于海关法和新税则的草拟工作，并颁发了若干重要的条例规章。
    旧中国海关存在将近百年，从未有过海关基本法，一切都按照帝国主义代理人海关总税务司的命令办事。海关总署成立后，即计划进行海关法规的草拟工作。本年一月二十七日，政务院的决定更明确规定由海关总署负责限期完成草案。我们于二月间成立海关法规专门委员会，经过四个月的审慎研究，于六月间完成初稿，经召集全国关务会议讨论后，又经过总署反复修改整理审订，现正由政务院专门小组审查中。我们制定海关法草案的基本根据，是人民政协共同纲领和政务院关于关税政策和海关工作的决定，它具体体现了新中国海关的方针政策，总结了全国海关的工作经验，明确系统地规定了新海关机构的组织、任务、职权和统一的、一致的海关工作方法，规定进行对外贸易的一般国家机关、交通运输部门、社会团体和私人对于遵守海关规章的责任和义务以及海关和他们之间的相互关系。我们深信，这一海关法的施行，将使全国海关工作走上一个新的阶段。
    关于新税则的编制工作，在关税税则委员会的主持下，根据正务院所规定的海关税则必须保护国家生产，必须保护国内生产品与外国商品的竞争，及以与我国有无贸易条约或协定关系而运用两种不同的税率等基本原则，经过半年的努力，调查研究中外货物的比较价格，国内国外的产销情形，并与中央有关各部门联系磋商，已于七月底完成草案初稿。复经多次审查修正，已于十一月间定稿，正呈请审核中。这个新税则将是中国第一个真正独立自主的保护主义的和全国统一的海关税则。
    此外海关总署在这一年中，根据必要和可能，首先颁布了许多重要的单行办法，如：海关处理滞报滞纳及过期未税进口货物暂行办法，海关审理税则分类估价申诉案件暂行办法，归国华侨携带行李物品免税优待办法，海关查私提奖准备金暂行办法等。尚有停止国内邮包检查实施办法等多种即将颁布实施。旧的业务制度已基本上不适用，在新海关法和新税则颁布前，这些新办法的发布虽已初步解决了一些业务方面的问题，但尚远远落后于工作的需要。
            （四）实施货运监管
    根据本年一至十月的统计，全国进口物资，占全部进出口贸易总值百分之四三点零六。全国出口物资占全部进出口贸易总值百分之五六点九四。出超占进口总值百分之三二点二三。如从公私经济成份来看，一至十月份，出口贸易中国营占百分之五四点三八，私营占百分之四五点六二。进口贸易中国营占百分之六九点九四，私营占百分之三零点零六。出口商品主要是黄豆、桐油、猪鬃、花生、羊毛、蛋品、茶叶、矿砂等。进口商品主要是生产设备器材、工业原料、尤其以棉花为大宗。这就表明：中央人民政府成立后，全国公私营对外贸易已日益恢复发展起来，旧中国长期入超情况，已经发生重大变化，正如陈云主任所说的：“半殖民地性的对外贸易，已经改变为保护贸易了。非中国国民经济所需要的外国商品，已停止进口，而国内多余的农产品与农副产品，在保护农民而不是剥削农民的原则下，实行了最大限度的出口。百年来入超与外汇负债的时代，也从一九五○年起完全改变了。”
    新中国经济政策和海关政策的根本方针，决定着新海关的性质和职能不同于单纯的税收机关。它首先应是国家的监督机关——对进出国境的货运执行实际的监督。它的任务是根据中央人民政府对外贸易管制的政策法令，对一切公私进出口货运实施监管。一年来海关对于货运监管任务的执行，虽然发生许多困难，例如有些地方不承认这种监管的必要性，甚或认为多此一举，表示不满，但各地海关已经克服许多困难，开始建立了货运监管工作，基本上并能根据国家对外贸易管制政策和海关总署的规定指示，结合当地具体情况，区别轻重，区别对象，有重点地进行工作，以执行实际监管任务。但在办事手续上，因旧海关内部机构重叠，分工琐细，进口货物自报关到放行，要经过二十余道手续，使一般人民有“过关难”之感。解放后，各地海关对过去不合理的制度规章和繁复手续，开始进行改革，但由于新老海关人员或长期习惯于沿用旧的制度和工作方法，或对海关业务不熟，不善于把中央的政策方针与海关具体业务结合，因此，不合理的监管制度和繁复的办事手续尚待进一步改革。
            （五）征收关税
    新海关征税工作的基本任务是在于正确执行关税政策和运用税则税率，保护我国生产；这是对外经济斗争的武器，同时，亦为国家重要财政收入之一。我们海关工作人员，在进行税收工作时，首先要保证关税政策的正确执行；其次要大力防止走私漏税，少报价格等现象，以保证完成规定的税收任务；第三要保证迅速将税款解缴国库。一年来在税收方面，因沿海岛屿陆续解放，华东华南封锁威胁一度松弛，进口物资输入，骤然旺盛。全国海关税收至十一月底止，初步统计已完成全年预计任务百分之一四四点四七。各关税收均已做到及时解库，并能定期汇报税收数字。
    在新的统一的进出口关税税则尚未公布施行前，对现行旧的进出口税则，已先后进行了部分的订正，如为扶助国内生产建设，保证原料供应，减低生产成本，在国棉不足情况下，外棉进口准予免税。其他农业用杀虫剂、实验器械、科学仪器等亦予专案免税，抽纱工业用的细洋纱、软洋纱等进口原料的税率均予酌减。为了保护工业，对铁钉、风灯等税率均予提高。
    此外，值得附带一提的，全国海关仓库物资清理工作，自本年五月起至十月底止，已大部完成，现已全部清理就绪，清出的物资，总值人民币三一、七八八、五○三、四七八元。由于实行精简节约，使各关税收增加，支出减少，全国海关的支出已由解放前占全部关税收入百分之二十减至百分之五。全年的经费支出，除天津海关由中央人民政府财政部直接供给外，其他各关系由各大行政区初审并代中央支拨。现在我们已与中财部研究决定，自一九五一年起，除东北外全国各关经费由本署统一调拨。这是统一财政的重要而且必需的措施。
            （六）和走私进行斗争
    查禁走私是人民海关三大任务之一。根据本年一至九月的统计，全国各关查获的私货总值占同期税收百分之四·三，这是很大的成绩。其中华南的九龙、广州、拱北三关查获的私货就超过全部私货的半数。进口的私货主要是金属制品、西药、海产品、染料、纸类、化学品等；出口的私货主要是金银、动物及动物产品、米谷、棉织品、丝织品等。此外，如天津、青岛、汕头等关在验估时曾破获谎报套汇避重就轻的逃税违章案件，上海海关发觉诡报驶往设有海关地点，实际将船开赴待解放区的案件，都已从管理和技术上加强监管。
    全国海关在查私工作上虽然获得许多的成绩，但走私情况仍是严重地存在着。国界沿边沿海的封锁尚欠严密，查私工作方法也有许多缺点。特别是华南今天还是走私最严重地区，即以水客走私来说，已成为华南进出口管制中一个很大的问题。部分海关在具体工作中尚不能正确地贯彻区别轻重，分清对象，处罚与教育相结合的查私方针。以致在某些地方，过份强调处罚，引起群众的不满，另一些地方，则又不恰当地偏重宽大，实际上是放任了走私。另方面，旧海关严重的贪污作风，尚未完全肃清，如广州海关八百余人中，解放后仍犯贪污的竟有一百六十人之多，也大大影响了查私工作的顺利执行。
            （七）新的展望新的努力
    一年来的全国海关工作，虽然由于中央的正确领导，和新老干部的团结合作，一致努力，获得了以上的成绩；但建设新的人民海关的工作，还仅仅是开始。目前形势，更加要求我们必须坚持政务院关于“中央人民政府海关总署，必须是统一集中的和独立自主的国家机构”的方针，迅速实施海关法和新税则，拟订海关法所规定的条例规章，加强思想政策教育，提高政治业务水平，特别要厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污、禁止浪费、反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风，培养新式的海关工作人员。今后海关总署必须把工作重心逐渐转移到加强对全国实际业务的帮助和领导，进一步密切和各地海关的工作联系，了解全国各关业务情况，召开若干必要的专业会议，从各个方面统一业务制度，改进工作作风，纠正工作中的缺点，以完成中央人民政府所赋予我们的任务。
    中国经济必须一步一步地避免过去无政府状态而带有更大的计划性，必须实现共同纲领所规定的“争取早日制定恢复和发展全国公私经济各主要部门的总计划”。海关作为国家行政机关，应在这一恢复和发展国民经济的事业中，起其重要作用，真正成为保护新中国工业发展的一个重要工具。对新中国海关的这种性质职能和其重要作用认识不清的现象，应该加以澄清。对于过去长期为帝国主义经济侵略服务的旧中国海关，表示厌恶不满的态度是完全正确的，反对旧的大海关主义的特殊思想是完全必要的，但必须防止另一极端偏向，如否认今天海关在我们国家行政工作和新民主主义经济建设中的作用意义，以及不了解新中国海关的性质和职能已发生了根本的变化，因而不加以爱护帮助，而继续采取反对的态度，那是错误有害的。
    必须懂得，中国大门的钥匙，百年来，都是放在帝国主义及其走狗的袋子里，我国人民经济和国计民生，因此吃了大亏，现在由于人民大革命的胜利，我们已把它夺取过来，放在自己的袋子里，就应知所爱护，把它管好，使它真正发挥重要作用。帝国主义者及其代理人是不高兴中国有一个独立自主的海关的，像他们曾预言：新中国财政经济的困难是无法克服的一样，也曾预言，中国海关没有他们就办不好，就要坍台，他们鼓吹旧海关在洋税务司手中办得如何好，“即世界各国，亦无不同声称道”，宣传新海关，搞得如何坏，没有秩序，不成样子，极尽讥讽之能事。旧海关最后的一任也是绝后的一个伪总税务司李度——美帝国主义控制中国海关的代理人，曾从香港、台湾等地纷纷发出函信电报勾引海关人员“只要你宣誓不替共产党海关办事，我就给你钱，发你养老金”，千方百计来进行挑拨破坏。但是一年来，新中国海关的成就，给予了敌人卑贱无耻的阴谋以有力的回击。由于全体新老干部人员，团结在以毛主席为首的中华人民共和国中央人民政府的领导下，共同努力，我们已经克服许多困难，正把一个独立自主的新中国海关建设起来。
