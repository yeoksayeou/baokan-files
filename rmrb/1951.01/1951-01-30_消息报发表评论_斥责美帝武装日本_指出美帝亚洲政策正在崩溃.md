　　[Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch] TASS, Moscow: Kudryavtsev published an article in *Izvestia* on the 24th, discussing the revival of Japanese militarism by US imperialists. The author pointed out: The US armed intervention in Korea fully exposed its aims in Japan. The Japanese archipelago was immediately used as a supply base for the American invasion of the Asian continent. At the same time, the US occupation authorities in Japan are proceeding with the establishment of a Japanese mercenary army. MacArthur established a so-called "Police Reserve Force" of 75,000 officers and soldiers last year. Currently, the ruling circles in Japan are discussing increasing the strength of the "Reserve Force" to 200,000 to 300,000 men, as well as the possibility of using this "Reserve Force" outside of Japan.

　　The Japanese reactionaries, headed by the Yoshida government, assist the US imperialists in carrying out various evil plans. In return, the US imperialists are doing everything possible to encourage the revanchist and militarist sentiments of the Japanese reactionaries. They believe that this sentiment will facilitate the rapid re-militarization of Japan. Japanese reactionary leaders such as Yoshida and Ashida are advocating the revision of the Cairo Conference and Potsdam Conference decisions and the rearmament of Japan almost every day. The Japanese government is encouraging the activities of fascist and nationalist groups prohibited by the Potsdam Proclamation. According to Kyodo News, Yoshida, under the protection of MacArthur's headquarters, intends to restore the political rights of more than 180,000 people who were directly or indirectly involved in the crimes of Japanese imperialism in the near future.

　　At the same time, the Japanese authorities, encouraged by MacArthur's headquarters, are persecuting the democratic groups of the Japanese people who firmly demand the demilitarization and democratization of Japan.

　　The author concludes: The US imperialist policy of rearming Japan and reviving Japanese militarism shows that the US policy in Asia is collapsing. At the same time, the attempt by the US ruling circles to seek support among the most reactionary elements that have long been despised by the Asian people is also doomed to failure. The US ruling circles' attempt to revive Japanese militarism, which is hated by the Asian people, only confirms that they are the mortal enemies of the Asian people.

    斥责美帝武装日本
    指出美帝亚洲政策正在崩溃
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：库德里雅夫契夫二十四日在消息报上著文论美帝国主义者复活日本军国主义。作者指出：美国武装干涉朝鲜，充分地暴露了它在日本所追求的目的。日本群岛立刻就被用为美国侵略亚洲大陆的供应基地。同时，美国驻日占领当局正在进行建立日本雇佣军队。麦克阿瑟在去年建立了一支由七万五千名官兵组成的所谓“警察后备队”。目前日本的统治集团正在讨论将“后备队”的兵力增加到二三十万人的问题，以及在日本国外使用这支“后备队”的可能性。
    以吉田政府为首的日本反动派，协助美帝国主义者推行各种罪恶计划作为对他们的酬答，美国帝国主义者则千方百计鼓励日本反动派的复仇主义和军国主义的情绪。他们认为，这种情绪将便利在日本迅速重新军国主义化。日本反动派的领袖如吉田、芦田之流，几乎每天都在鼓吹修改开罗会议和波茨坦会议的决定，重新武装日本。日本政府鼓励波茨坦公告所禁止的法西斯和民族主义的团体进行活动。根据共同社的材料，吉田在麦克阿瑟总部的庇护下，打算在最近的将来恢复十八万以上曾直接或间接参与日本帝国主义罪行的人的政治权利。
    同时，日本当局得到麦克阿瑟总部的鼓励，正迫害坚决要求日本非军国主义化及民主化的日本人民的民主团体。
    作者结语称：美帝国主义重新武装日本和使日本军国主义复活的方针，表明美国在亚洲的政策已在崩溃之中。同时，美国统治集团想要在亚洲人民早已鄙弃的最反动的分子中找寻支持的企图，也是注定要失败的。美国统治集团要使亚洲人民所痛恨的日本军国主义复活，不过证实了他们是亚洲人民的死敌而已。
