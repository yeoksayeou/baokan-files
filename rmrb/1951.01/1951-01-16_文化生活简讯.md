	Cultural Life Briefs

	Pay Attention to Cultural and Educational Policies Among Ethnic Minorities!
	According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, January 11th: Some responsible cadres in the Zhalantun Banner of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region do not understand the government's cultural and educational policies, nor do they understand the importance of respecting and developing the languages and writing systems of ethnic minorities. They reject Mongolian education, which affects teaching. Although leading comrades pointed this out during the rectification campaign, this error has not been effectively corrected. This is completely incorrect.

	10 Million Yuan in Literary and Artistic Awards
	According to the Southern Daily, January 8th: The Cultural and Educational Department of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government calls on the entire province to vigorously develop mass literary and artistic movements and create works that the masses love. The Provincial Cultural and Educational Department has allocated 10 million yuan as awards for outstanding works. This method of rewarding literary and artistic creation is worth promoting.

	Nanjing Ginling University Faculty and Staff Expose American Imperialist Aggression
	According to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, January 12th: Dai Longsun, a staff member of Nanjing Private Ginling University, and Cui Yujun, a professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics, revealed that the first president of the university, Fukaisen (an American), cloaked in the guise of "promoting culture," secretly informed the Qing government to arrest revolutionary party members Zou Rong, Zhang Binglin, and four others. Louis, a "China expert," under the guise of a professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics, used students to conduct silver price surveys, creating favorable conditions for the subsequent "Sino-American Silver Agreement" by which American imperialism plundered China economically, seizing 100.04 million taels of silver in two instances.

	Reactionary Elements at Tianjin Jingu University Dismissed
	According to the Tianjin Daily, January 10th: Bu Xiangxian (French), Vice President of Tianjin Catholic Church School, Private Jingu University, Sun Zhihong, Dean of Studies, and Shen Xi, Secretary-General, have consistently refused to implement the New Democratic education policy since liberation. They have carried out reactionary propaganda of imperialism against the Chinese people, slandering the People's Government and the people's leaders. Recently, they have obstructed and sabotaged the school's patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea movement, arousing unanimous anger among the teachers and students. On the 6th of this month, the teachers and students of the school unanimously demanded that Bu and others be immediately removed. The school's board of directors has accepted the teachers' and students' request and removed Bu and others from their positions.

	Soviet Sports Delegation Arrives in Guangzhou
	A 23-member Soviet sports delegation arrived in Guangzhou on the evening of the 13th. Among those who went to the station to welcome them were Liang Guang, Vice Mayor of Guangzhou, Qin Yuanbang, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, Lai Dachao, Deputy Secretary of the South China Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and more than 1,000 representatives from various government agencies, organizations, and schools.
