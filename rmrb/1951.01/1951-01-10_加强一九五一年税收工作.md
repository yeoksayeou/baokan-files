Strengthening the 1951 Tax Collection Work
    Yang Jizhi

　　In the 1950 national fiscal budget, agricultural tax and various urban taxes combined accounted for 80.3 percent of the revenue portion of the budget, while other revenues accounted for only 19.7 percent. Through the efforts of this year, great achievements have been made in the collection of various taxes, some even exceeding the original plans. As a result, the living expenses of our military, government, public institutions, and teachers have been guaranteed, and the recovery and development of our country's economic undertakings have been started with a focus. More importantly, it has brought our country's finances and cash revenue and expenditure close to balance, no longer relying on issuing banknotes but on tax revenue and saving expenditures to solve the problem. The hyperinflation that has harmed the people of the whole country most deeply for twelve years has been basically stopped within a year. The decision of the National Financial Conference in February 1950 on implementing unified national financial economy was the starting point of this great transformation.

　　The process and changes experienced in tax collection work over the past year are roughly as follows: The collection of agricultural tax in 1949, as Vice Premier Chen Yun said, "was carried out under difficult circumstances. Most areas were newly liberated areas, unfamiliar with the people and land, and the time was short. The financial and economic responsible authorities had neglected to stipulate a unified national collection method in advance. Therefore, although it was generally collected, there were problems such as excessively light or heavy burdens, and coercive orders." The collection of agricultural tax in 1950, however, learned from the lessons of 1949. The central financial authorities made full preparations in advance, and after repeated discussions and consultations with democratic figures from all parties on tax rates and tax laws, the State Council passed the decision on the summer grain requisition in the newly liberated areas in May, and the Government Committee passed the provisional regulations on agricultural tax in the newly liberated areas in September. The State Council also issued instructions on the collection of agricultural tax, making the burden ratio of all classes more fair and reasonable, and emphasizing the responsibility of the top leaders, training of cadres, mastery of tax laws, organizing investigation and evaluation committees with representatives from all classes, and stipulating rewards and punishments to overcome the work style of coercive orders. In addition, the development of rectification movements led by local party committees basically avoided the various problems that occurred in the grain requisition work in 1949, ensuring the smooth completion of the summer and autumn grain requisition in 1950.

　　The collection of various urban taxes is generally similar to the collection of agricultural tax. We have been in the countryside for a long time in the past and lack sufficient experience in urban work, so it is inevitable that some shortcomings and errors will occur. For example, the tax authorities had inconsistent interpretations of the tax regulations formulated by the first tax conference in 1949, the tax system was not simplified enough, and there were contradictions between tasks and tax rates in the implementation. Unreasonable phenomena such as squeezing the small by the big, unfair burdens, and crude work style of tax cadres occurred in individual areas. In response to these shortcomings and biases, the industrial and commercial sectors have put forward many valuable criticisms and suggestions. In June last year, the Second National Tax Conference studied in detail the tax rates, tax rules, and collection methods, reducing the number of commodity tax items from 1,136 to 358, and making appropriate revisions to other tax rates as well. In terms of collection methods, three methods were adopted: self-declaration, account checking and rate calculation, self-declaration, public discussion, and democratic evaluation, and fixed-term fixed-amount. It was also decided to organize industrial and commercial tax democratic evaluation committees and tax review committees. The State Taxation Bureau was also instructed to set up a special group to absorb representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors to participate in revising the tax law articles and implementing rules based on the conference decisions. On December 19 last year, the State Council ordered the promulgation of the provisional regulations on industrial and commercial tax, the provisional regulations on commodity tax, and the provisional regulations on stamp tax, slaughter tax, and interest income tax, which were revised and approved by the 63rd State Council meeting. The industrial and commercial tax democratic evaluation committees and tax review committees were consolidated by regulations, and the organizational rules of the two committees were promulgated. After this series of work, the shortcomings and biases that occurred in tax collection in the past have been overcome and corrected. However, some other shortcomings and biases have emerged, that is, tax cadres mistakenly believe that emphasizing "rate calculation" and "democratic consultation" is for "correcting deviations" and "reducing burdens," and they have failed to clearly distinguish between the achievements and shortcomings and errors of past tax collection work. As a result, they have developed a shrinking attitude in collection, fearing to make mistakes, fearing to be criticized by superiors if they fail to complete tasks, and fearing that the industrial and commercial sectors will "complain" if they actively collect taxes. To some extent, there is a phenomenon of laissez-faire in tax collection work. As a result, the taxes that should be collected cannot be collected, and tax evasion and arrears are serious. For example, in the provinces of the Northwest Region and Xi'an City, tax revenue before June exceeded the original plan, but it dropped significantly in July, August, and September. In the second quarter of Xi'an City, the number of business tax delinquent households accounted for 29 percent of the tax-paying industrial and commercial households. Some industrial and commercial operators who do not understand the overall situation also take advantage of the tax cadres' misperceptions to exploit loopholes, conceal reports, delay payments, resist payments, and make unreasonable noises. Some cunning individuals even refuse to report half a year of business tax and confront the tax authorities. This reduces the state's income and makes the industrial and commercial operators who pay taxes on time and at the rate dissatisfied. This kind of erroneous understanding and bias must be quickly overcome and corrected with appropriate measures.

　　The financial situation in 1951 still has many difficulties. The US imperialists are still taking various so-called "emergency measures" to expand their war of aggression, which forces us to pay attention to strengthening national defense construction. The situation of financial and price stability, which has been of most concern to the people of the whole country in the past year, must also be continuously consolidated. Economic construction must also be carried out with a focus. This requires our tax authorities and tax cadres across the country to improve their work, continue to work hard, and strive to complete the tasks of 1951!

　　In order to complete the tax collection tasks of 1951, tax authorities and all tax cadres should pay special attention to the following points:

　　1. Master professional knowledge and strengthen investigation and research. The new tax law has been promulgated, and it is necessary for tax authorities at all levels to lead all tax cadres in a wave of studying and researching the new tax law. This is an important link in improving work. Many tax cadres are accustomed to working hard to complete the tasks assigned by their superiors, which is of course good, but not loving to learn is a very serious shortcoming. In this way, although the task may be completed, it is still blind and prone to errors. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the study of tax laws. Only by mastering the tax laws can the task be completed smoothly and errors can be avoided and reduced. Secondly, we must strengthen investigation and research work. Over the past year, tax authorities and tax cadres have indeed accumulated some experience, explored some work rules, and have some preliminary understanding of the national industrial and commercial situation, but it should be admitted that it is still fragmented and inaccurate. In the future, investigation and research should be carried out in a planned and organized manner. The higher the leading organs, the more importance should be attached to this work. Not only should the past materials be sorted out, but more emphasis should be placed on studying the changing situation, and some categorized typical investigations should be carried out systematically so that we have reliable basis when implementing policies, tasks, and solving problems.

　　2. Strengthen anti-smuggling and block loopholes. Although tax collection in 1950 has made great achievements, tax evasion is quite serious and widespread. According to materials from the Central South Region, tax evasion and underpayment of industrial and commercial tax are generally more than 14 percent, and the overall tax evasion in the region is 30 percent. It is estimated that tax evasion nationwide is more than 20 percent, which is a major loss to the state's finances. Tax cadres must understand: "rate calculation" and "democratic consultation" are correct, but not collecting or undercollecting from those who should be taxed is wrong; taxpayers paying taxes in accordance with the regulations is an obligation to the state, while tax evasion and resistance to payment are illegal; tax cadres strengthening anti-smuggling and blocking loopholes is a duty, and ignoring tax evasion is a manifestation of irresponsibility to work and should be corrected. In the 1951 fiscal year, if we collect more than 20 percent of the evaded taxes that should be collected, it is not only a considerable income that the state should have, but also an encouragement to industrial and commercial operators who pay taxes on time and at the rate, making them feel that the government is indeed fair and reasonable, and tax cadres are indeed serious and responsible in their work. For tax evaders, it is legal and reasonable. In the recent movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect the homeland, the industrial and commercial sectors in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Nanjing, Chongqing, Changsha, and Nanchang have spontaneously included clauses such as "no tax arrears," "no tax evasion," "complete tax collection tasks," "no false reports," and "no tax evasion" in patriotic covenants as one of the main contents. The manifestation of this patriotic spirit of the industrial and commercial sector should be praised and assisted in its realization.

　　3. Improve leadership of tax work. Governments and financial organs at all levels should attach more importance to the leadership of tax work, strengthen the education of tax cadres in political policies, help them understand the work situation, summarize their work, solve their difficulties in life, and deploy enough strong cadres to do tax work, and try to professionalize tax cadres as much as possible without easily transferring them. Tax authorities at all levels should train cadres in a planned manner. The tax school led by the State Taxation Bureau should become the main organ for training tax cadres. The content of its education should pay more attention to practical problems, organize students to participate in investigation and research and regular internships, and combine the study of policies and laws with practice, and summarize and analyze them. In addition, work summary meetings and investigation and research meetings should be held regularly for the hundreds of thousands of tax cadres across the country in their work positions, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out seriously to improve the work ability and policy level of cadres.

　　加强一九五一年税收工作
    杨济之
    一九五○年的全国财政概算，农业税和各项城市税收合计起来占概算中收入部分的百分之八十点三，而其它收入只占百分之十九点七。经过这一年的努力，在各种税收的征收上，均获得很大成绩，有的并超过了原定的计划。因之，保证了我国军政公教人员生活费用的开支，并能有重点地开始恢复和发展我国的经济事业。更重要的，是使我们国家的财政和现金收支接近平衡，不再依靠发行钞票而依靠税收和节省支出来解决。使十二年来危害全国人民最深的通货膨胀，在一年内基本停止了。一九五○年二月全国财政会议关于实行统一国家财政经济的决定，则是这一伟大转变的起点。
    一年来税收工作所经历的过程和变化大致如下：一九四九年农业税的征收情况，正如陈云副总理所说，“是在一种困难的情况下进行的，大部地区是新解放区，人地生疏，时间短促，财经负责机关事先又疏忽了规定全国统一征收办法，因此虽然大体征起，但有畸轻畸重、强迫命令等项毛病。”而一九五○年的农业税的征收，则接受了一九四九年的教训，中央财经机关事先进行了充分的准备工作，并和各方民主人士多次座谈协商研究税率税法后，政务院于五月通过了一九五○年新解放区夏征公粮的决定，九月人民政府委员会通过新解放区农业税暂行条例，政务院亦发布征收农业税的指示，各阶层的负担比例趋于公平合理，并强调首长负责、训练干部、精通税法，组织有各阶层代表参加的调查评议委员会，规定奖惩，克服强迫命令作风；加以各地党委所领导的整风运动的开展，使一九四九年在征粮工作上所发生的各种毛病基本上得以避免，保证了一九五○年夏征和秋征顺利完成。
    城市各项税收的征收情况，大体也和农业税的征收相类似。我们过去长时间处在农村，对城市工作缺乏足够的经验，因而也不可避免地发生一些缺点和错误。如税务机关对于一九四九年第一届税务会议制定的税务条例解释不一致，税制不够简化，执行中任务和税率曾发生矛盾，个别地区发生过小挤大、大挤小，负担不公，税收干部作风生硬等不合理的现象。针对这些缺点和偏向，工商界曾提出了不少宝贵的批评和建议。去年六月，全国二届税务会议，详细研究了税率税则和征收方法，将货物税税目由一千一百三十六个减并为三百五十八个，其他税率也均做了适当的修正；在征收方法上，采用自报查帐依率计征、自报公议民主评定、定期定额三种，并决定组织工商业税民主评议委员会，税务复议委员会；并责成税务总局成立专门小组，吸收工商界代表根据会议决定参加修正税法条文和施行细则。去年十二月十九日，政务院又将六十三次政务会议修正通过的工商业税暂行条例、货物税暂行条例，以及讨论通过的印花税暂行条例、屠宰税暂行条例、利息所得税暂行条例命令公布；并将工商业税民主评议委员会、税务复议委员会用条例巩固下来，公布了两个委员会的组织通则。经过这一系列的工作后，在税收上过去所发生的缺点和偏向是克服和纠正了。但是却产生了另外一些缺点和偏向，那就是税收干部错误地认为强调“依率计征”、“民主评议”是为了“纠偏”和“减轻负担”，对以往税收工作的成绩和缺点错误未能分辨清楚，因而在征收上产生畏缩情绪，怕犯错误，完不成任务怕受上级批评，积极收税又怕工商业界“告状”，在某种程度上税收工作存在有自流现象。因此使应该征到的税收征不起来，漏税欠税也严重存在。如西北区各省及西安市，六月以前税收均超过原计划，而七、八、九三个月则下降很多，西安市第二季度营业税滞纳户占纳税工商户的百分之二十九。一部分不明大义的工商业者也利用税收干部的错误认识钻空子、瞒报、拖欠、抗缴、无理喊叫，个别刁顽的甚至拒报半年营业税，和税务机关对抗。这就减少了国家的收入，使按率按期缴税的工商业者亦因此而不满。这种错误认识和偏向，必须迅速采取适当措施加以克服和纠正。
    一九五一年的财政情况，依然有许多困难存在着，美帝国主义者还在采取各种所谓“紧急措施”扩大其侵略战争，这就迫使我们不得不注意到加强国防建设。一年来为全国人民所最关心的金融物价稳定的局面，也必须继续巩固。经济建设也必须重点进行。这就要求我们的税务机关和全国税收干部改进自己的工作，继续努力，为完成一九五一年的任务而斗争！
    为了完成一九五一年的税收任务，税务机关和全体税收干部应特别注意以下各点：
    一、精通业务，加强调查研究。新的税法已经公布，各地税务机关有必要领导全体税收干部来一个学习研究新税法的热潮，这是改进工作的重要一环。很多税收干部多习惯于努力完成上级交给的任务，这当然是好的，但不爱学习则是很严重的缺点。这样，任务虽可能完成，但仍是盲目性的，极易产生错误。因此必须加强对税法的学习，只有精通了税法，任务才能顺利完成，才能避免及减少错误。其次还须加强调查研究工作。一年来，税收机关和税收干部确实累积了一些经验，摸索了一些工作规律，对全国工商业情况有了一些初步的了解，但应该承认还是很片断和不精确的，今后应该有计划有组织地进行调查研究，越是较高的领导机关越应重视这项工作，不仅应把过去的材料加以整理，更应特别着重研究变化着的情况，有系统地进行一些分门别类的典型调查，使我们在执行政策、任务、解决问题时有可靠的根据。
    二、加强缉私，堵塞偷漏。一九五○年的税收虽有很大的成绩，但偷漏相当严重和普遍。据中南区材料，仅工商业税漏税、少纳普遍在百分之十四以上，全区总的漏税情况则在百分之三十。全国范围内的漏税估计则在百分之二十以上，这是国家财政上的重大损失。税收干部必须了解：“依率计征”、“民主协商”是正确的，但应征者不征或少征则是错误的；纳税人按章缴税是对国家应尽的义务，而逃税漏税、抗缴则是违法的；税收干部加强缉私堵塞偷漏是应尽之责，对偷漏漠视才是对工作不负责任的表现，应该改正。在一九五一年度，假如把应征起的百分之二十以上的漏税收起，不仅对于国家的财政收入是一笔相当可观的应得的收入，对按章按期缴税的工商业者也是一种鼓励，使他们感到政府确是公平合理，税收干部对工作确是认真负责。对漏税者说来，则是合法合理的。在最近抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，各大城市的工商业界，如北京、上海、武汉、南京、重庆、长沙、南昌等地均自动地把“不欠税”、“不逃税”、“完成税收任务”、“不虚报”、“不偷漏”等条文自发地列入爱国公约中，作为主要内容之一。工商业界这种爱国主义精神的表现，应该加以表扬，并协助他们实现。
    三、改进对税务工作的领导。各级政府、财经机关应该更加重视对税务工作的领导，加强对税收干部政治政策的教育，帮助他们了解工作情况、总结工作，解决他们生活上的困难，并调配足够的坚强的干部去做税务工作，且尽量使税收干部专业化，而不轻易调动。各级税务机关应有计划地训练干部，税务总局领导的税务学校，应该成为培养税务干部的主要机关，其教育内容应更加注重实际问题，组织学员参加调查研究和定期的实习，把政策法令的学习和实际结合起来，加以总结分析。此外，对于在工作岗位上全国十几万税收干部亦应定期的开工作总结会、调查研究会，认真开展批评与自我批评，以提高干部的工作能力与政策水平。
