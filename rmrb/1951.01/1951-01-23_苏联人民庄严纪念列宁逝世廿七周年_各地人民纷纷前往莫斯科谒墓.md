Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: The Soviet people solemnly and grandly commemorate the 27th anniversary of the death of Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the world's working people. On the 21st, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, the Soviets of Working People's Representatives of Moscow Oblast and Moscow City, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, the Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, as well as representatives of the Soviet Army and people's organizations, held a commemorative meeting at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. When Stalin, the successor to Lenin's great cause, and other leaders of the Soviet government and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Andreyev, Khrushchev, Kosygin, Shvernik, Suslov, Ponomarenko, and Shkiryatov, stepped onto the podium, the hall resounded with prolonged cheers. After Shvernik delivered the opening remarks, Pospelov, the director of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute of the Soviet Union, gave a report on the 27th anniversary of Lenin's death.

Since the 19th, working people from all over the Soviet Union have been flocking to visit Lenin's Mausoleum in groups. They formed long lines in Red Square, including workers, collective farmers, Soviet Army soldiers, scientists, artists, teachers, students, and forest planters from distant places. As the Kremlin bells chimed, people paid their respects to the immortal Lenin in turn. They were so quiet, as if afraid to disturb Lenin's final rest. As they left the mausoleum, people gazed at the Kremlin, where the great Stalin—Lenin's comrade-in-arms and the successor to his cause—was working.

On the 19th alone, 15,000 people from all over the country came to visit the mausoleum. Since that sorrowful day of January 21, 1924, approximately 29 million people have visited Lenin's Mausoleum.

　　苏联人民庄严纪念列宁逝世廿七周年
    各地人民纷纷前往莫斯科谒墓
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联人民庄严隆重地纪念世界劳动人民的伟大领袖与导师列宁逝世二十七周年。二十一日，苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃主席团、莫斯科州与莫斯科市劳动人民代表苏维埃、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会、全苏工会中央理事会主席团，以及苏军代表和人民团体在莫斯科大剧院举行了纪念大会。当列宁伟大事业的继承人斯大林和苏联政府及苏联共产党的其他领袖莫洛托夫、马林科夫、贝利亚、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、安得烈也夫、赫鲁舍切夫、柯西金、什维尔尼克、苏斯洛夫、波诺马林科、施基利亚托夫步上主席台时，会场上响彻了经久不息的欢呼。什维尔尼克致开会词后，苏联马恩列学院院长波斯伯洛夫作了关于列宁逝世二十七周年的报告。
    从十九日起，来自苏联各地的劳动人民成群结队地前往参谒列宁陵寝。他们在红场上排成了长长的行列，中间有工人、集体农民、苏军将士、科学家、艺术工作者、教师、学生以及来自远方的森林种植者等。克里姆林宫的钟声在回响，人们依次向不朽的列宁致敬。他们是这样肃静，好象害怕惊动了列宁最后的安眠。人们在离开陵墓的时候凝视着克里姆林宫，在那里，伟大的斯大林——列宁的战友和他的事业的继承者在工作着。
    仅在十九日一天内，全国就有一万五千人前来谒墓。如果从一九二四年一月二十一日这个沉痛的日子算起，已有约二千九百万人参谒过列宁陵墓了。
