Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 29th. TASS Washington, 27th: Thirty-two prominent American figures, including writer Thomas Mann and the secretary of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (affiliated with the CIO), Rosenblum, have announced the establishment of a new "National Committee to Repeal the McCarran Act." This new committee was formed as a result of a petition signed by over nineteen hundred prominent Americans, demanding that Congress repeal the disgraceful fascist McCarran Act. A representative of the committee said: "The atmosphere of hysteria and coercion that has arisen since the passage of this act has strengthened the opposition of those who disapprove of its passage and has opened the eyes of many who had not fully perceived the dangers presented by this repressive bill."

　　美社会名流成立机构要求取消麦卡伦法案
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社华盛顿二十七日讯：包括作家汤麦斯·曼和成衣业工人混合工会（属产联）书记罗森勃鲁姆在内的美国社会名流三十二人，已宣布成立一个新的“取消麦卡伦法全国委员会”。这个新的委员会是由于一千九百余名美国名人所连署的一项呼吁书而成立的，该呼吁书要求国会取消可耻的法西斯的麦卡伦法。该委员会的代表说：“在这个法案通过以后所产生的歇斯底里与胁迫的空气，已使那些不赞成通过这个法案的人们增强其反对，并且已打开了许多未曾充分觉察这种压制的法案所呈现的危险性的人们的眼睛。”
