　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 26th: TASS, New York, January 26th: The United Nations General Assembly’s Political Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of the 24th, specifically to examine the Korean question.

　　The Political Committee reconvened after a forty-eight-hour recess, which was announced on the 22nd. Although the US delegation opposed it at the time, the Political Committee decided to recess to study the new possibilities for a peaceful resolution presented by the telegram from the People's Republic of China, which had been submitted to the Political Committee by the Indian representative to the United Nations, Rau, on the 22nd. The representative of Ecuador, Quevedo, spoke first, expressing his willingness to vote in favor of the American proposal. At the same time, he declared that if the Beijing government provided new explanations that "significantly changed" China's position, he would also change his attitude. The speech of the Venezuelan representative, in the final analysis, amounted to stating that he would vote in favor of the American proposal. The American representative, Austin, spoke after the Kuomintang elements. He strongly advocated the adoption of the American proposal to condemn the People's Republic of China, and said that the American troops would only leave Korea after they had "fully carried out their mission". Austin spoke in an impolite tone about China's proposals on the Korean issue and China's demand for a legitimate position within the United Nations. Next to speak was the Australian representative, Shawn, who said: Australia has decided to support the American proposal. The Paraguayan representative also supported the American proposal.

　　Next was the speech by the Czechoslovak representative, Nosek. He said: The purpose of the American proposal is to pave the way for a new war in order to ensure the profits of American monopoly capitalists. The purpose of the American proposal is to enable the American imperialists to continue their aggression in Korea and to expand the aggression to the People's Republic of China. Nosek emphasized that these military objectives of the American imperialists, these objectives that violate the United Nations Charter, are also directed against other countries, including the European people's democracies. He concluded his speech by saying: Czechoslovakia fully supports China's new proposal.

　　The committee adjourned at this point to reconvene on the 25th.

　　休会四十八小时后
    联大政委会续开会
    捷代表发言支持我国新建议
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于二十四日下午举行会议，专门审议朝鲜问题。
    政委会是在二十二日宣布的四十八小时休会后复会的，当时虽经美国代表团反对，但政委会仍决定休会，以便研究中华人民共和国的电报所产生的新的和平解决的可能性，该电已由印度驻联合国代表劳氏于二十二日提交政委会。厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎首先发言，表示愿意投票赞成美国的提案。同时他又宣称，如果北京政府提供新的解释，“能大大地改变”中国的立场，那么，他也会改变他的态度。委内揣拉代表的发言，归根结底不外声言他将投票赞成美国的提案。美国代表奥斯汀继国民党分子之后发言。他力主通过美国关于谴责中华人民共和国的提案，并且说，美国军队只有“完全执行了他们的使命”之后，才会离开朝鲜。奥斯汀以不礼貌的口吻谈论中国关于朝鲜问题的建议和中国对于联合国内的合法地位的要求。接着发言的是澳大利亚代表尚恩，他说：澳大利亚已决定支持美国提案。巴拉圭代表也赞成美国提案。
    接着是捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克发言。他说：美国提案的目的是为新战争铺平道路，以便确保美国垄断资本家的利润。美国提案的目的，是使美帝国主义者能够继续在朝鲜侵略，并将侵略扩大到中华人民共和国。诺塞克强调指出：美帝国主义者的这些军事目的，这些违反联合国宪章的目的，也是针对着包括欧洲人民民主国家在内的其他国家的。他在结束发言时说：捷克斯洛伐克充分支持中国的新建议。
    委员会至此休会至二十五日再开。
