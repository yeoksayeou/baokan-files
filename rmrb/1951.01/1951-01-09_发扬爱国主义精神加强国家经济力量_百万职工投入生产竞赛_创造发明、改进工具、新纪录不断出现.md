　　Promoting Patriotism and Strengthening National Economic Power
    Millions of Workers Join Production Competition
    Constant Emergence of Inventions, Tool Improvements, and New Records
    [This newspaper reports] The patriotic production competition movement is currently being carried out extensively and deeply throughout the country. New production records and inventions are appearing everywhere. Millions of workers are plunging into this production competition upsurge with a fighting spirit. They are determined to create even more brilliant achievements in the production of 1951.

    As of now, according to incomplete statistics from some provinces and cities in the Northeast, North China, Central South, and East China regions, as well as industrial sectors such as railways, coal mines, and postal and telecommunications, more than 1,200 industrial and mining enterprises and more than 1.2 million employees have participated in the patriotic production competition. Among them, the number of railway and electricity workers participating in the competition has reached more than 70% of the total number of employees. In the coal mining industry, the number of participants in the Northeast, North China, and East China alone reached more than 210,000, accounting for about 47% of the total number of coal mine employees in the country. Store employees in various places have also joined the competition. According to statistics from the five cities of Tianjin, Harbin, Zhangjiakou, Wuhan, and Wuxi, the number of participants also exceeds 10,000.

    In the competition, workers in various places have begun to pay attention to improving tools and creating inventions to improve production efficiency. Technicians and workers at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant cooperated to create a fan-shaped pressure plunger, which increased production efficiency by 239 times while maintaining 100% quality standards. The Jinan Industrial Bureau created and improved more than 170 kinds of tools in two months, which enabled most of the production tasks to be completed ahead of schedule. Li Bingyi of the Shenyang Textile Machinery Parts Factory created three new tools in a row during the competition, making a great contribution to production. Among them, the successful trial production of the forging hemp machine drum shaft increased work efficiency by 16 times. Ji Haoran, a model worker at the Shanghai Jiangnan Paper Mill, invented a bamboo rolling machine, which not only improved production efficiency, but also produced bamboo pulp of better quality than hand-made pulp on the market, and reduced costs by about 33%.

    While improving tools and creating inventions, various new production records are also constantly emerging. Chen Yuhua, a pneumatic drill operator at the Huainan Coal Mine, set a new national record of 88 tons of coal in six hours and ten minutes on December 16 last year while trying out longwall full caving coal mining. Then, on the 21st, he exceeded the previous record by mining more than 98 tons of coal in eight hours. Later, Gong Zhenhai of the same mine created a new record of 127 tons of coal on the 26th by advancing 1.25 meters on a 36.5-meter working face in seven hours. On the night of the 31st, Feng Xuran, a national model worker representative, created an even higher record of 146 tons of coal in six hours and thirty minutes. This exceeded the initial record of the Soviet Stakhanov (102 tons of coal in five hours and forty-five minutes). The Tangshan Power Plant set a national record of an average coal consumption of 0.561 kilograms in November last year, and the Hangzhou Zhakou Power Plant also set a new record of reducing coal consumption to 0.538 kilograms in the first and middle ten days of the same month, which was even lower than the coal consumption of the Tangshan Power Plant (Note: The coal consumption of both plants is calculated based on low calorific value. The load factor of the Tangshan Power Plant is better than that of Hangzhou, but the furnaces of the Tangshan Power Plant are not as good as those of the Hangzhou Power Plant. Due to different conditions, absolute comparisons cannot be made). In addition, the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace created a new record of 339 furnace ages. The Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill created a national record of 1.22 pounds for the 20-hour output of 20-count yarn. The two rotary kilns of Tangshan Qixin Cement Plant created a new record of safe operation. Other new records have also been created in various places.

    Thanks to the active efforts of the employees in various places, more than 200 industrial and mining enterprises across the country have completed or exceeded the annual production plan ahead of schedule last year. The Jinzhou Ceramics Factory, the Wang Zhaoda production team of the Luda Guanghe Machinery Factory, and others have also completed the challenged plan. Now, workers such as the Northeast Shixian Paper Mill and Zhang Zifu, a model worker at the Fushun Coal Mine, have proposed a challenge to all workers in the Northeast to ensure the completion of the first quarter production plan this year, and factories and mines have begun to respond. From this patriotic production competition, it can be predicted that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class, which has a glorious tradition and has been tempered through long-term struggle, will achieve even greater success on the industrial production front in 1951.

　　发扬爱国主义精神加强国家经济力量
    百万职工投入生产竞赛
    创造发明、改进工具、新纪录不断出现
    【本报讯】爱国主义的生产竞赛运动，现正在全国各地广泛深入开展中。生产中新纪录和创造发明到处出现。数百万工人群众，正以战斗的姿态，卷入这一生产竞赛高潮。他们决心在一九五一年的生产中，创造出更辉煌的成绩。
    截至目前止，据东北、华北、中南、华东四个地区的部分省、市和铁路、煤矿、邮电等产业部门的不完全统计，已有一千二百余个工矿企业单位和一百二十余万职工参加了爱国主义生产竞赛。其中铁路、电业参加竞赛的人数，都达到了全体职工人数的百分之七十以上。煤矿工业中仅东北、华北、华东三地参加人数即达二十一万余人，占全国煤矿职工总数的百分之四十七左右。各地店员亦参加了竞赛。据天津、哈尔滨、张家口、武汉、无锡五个城市统计，参加人数亦在一万以上。
    在竞赛中，各地职工已开始注意改进工具和创造发明，以提高生产效率。沈阳机器三厂技术员和工人合作创出了扇形压力闷子，使生产效率提高了二百三十九倍，质量还是百分之百合乎标准。济南工业局两个月中创造和改进了一百七十余种工具，因而使生产任务大部提前完成。沈阳纺织机件厂李炳义在竞赛中一连创造三种新工具，对生产有很大贡献。其中锻压麻机滚筒轴的试验成功，使工作效率提高了十六倍。上海江南造纸厂劳动模范计浩然发明了轧竹机，不仅使生产效率提高，品质也比市上手工制造的竹浆好，成本也降低了百分之三十三左右。
    在改进工具和创造发明同时，各种生产新纪录也在不断出现。淮南煤矿风镐手陈玉华在试用长壁全冒顶式采煤中，于去年十二月十六日在六小时十分内创出煤八十八吨的全国最高纪录。接着，二十一日又以八小时采煤九十八吨多超过前项纪录。其后，该矿巩振海又在二十六日以七小时在三六点五公尺的工作面上前进一点二五米，创造了采煤一百二十七吨的新纪录。三十一日夜，全国劳模代表酆绪然又以六小时三十分的时间创采煤一百四十六吨的更高纪录。超过了苏联斯达哈诺夫的初次（五小时四十五分采煤一百零二吨）纪录。唐山发电厂在去年十一月份创造了平均煤耗零点五六一公斤的全国纪录，杭州闸口电厂亦在同月上、中旬创造了降低煤耗至零点五三八公斤的新纪录，较唐山发电厂的煤耗还要低（按：两厂煤耗均按低热量计算，其中唐山电厂负荷因数较杭州好，但唐山电厂炉子不如杭州电厂，因条件不同，所以不能作绝对比较）。此外，上海钢铁一厂平炉炉龄创造了三百三十九炉的新纪录。上海国棉二厂二十支纱二十小时产量创造了一点二二磅的全国纪录。唐山启新洋灰厂两个旋窑创造了安全运转的新纪录。其他各地也创造了多种新纪录。
    由于各地职工们的积极努力，全国已有二百余工矿企业单位在去年提前完成或超过了全年生产计划。锦州陶瓷工厂、旅大广和机械厂王兆达生产小组等也都完成了挑战中的计划。现在，东北石岘造纸厂、抚顺煤矿劳模张子富等工人又向全东北工人提出了保证完成今年首季生产计划的挑战，并已有厂矿开始响应。从这次爱国主义生产竞赛中，可以预料：有着光荣传统而又久经斗争锻炼的中国工人阶级，在毛主席、中央人民政府、中国共产党领导下，一九五一年在工业生产战线上将会取得更大的成绩。
