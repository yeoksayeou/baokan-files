Revolutionary Soldier's Family Has Proof from the Unit
    Why Doesn't Lingshi County Government Grant Military Family Treatment?
    To the Editor:
    My home is in Wangjialing, Fourth District, Lingshi County, Shanxi Province. My family background is poor peasant. My father, Wang Daoxian, is over sixty years old; in addition, there are three younger brothers under the age of fourteen in the family.
    I left home in 1937 to join the revolution and now work at the Central South Military and Political University. In 1947, I corresponded with my family and sent a certificate of revolutionary soldier. However, the responsible comrades of the County People's Government said that the Military and Political University is a school, and my family cannot enjoy the treatment of a revolutionary soldier's family. I sent several letters to the County People's Government, but received no reply. Later, I received a letter from home saying that the family's life was very difficult, and the government still did not provide preferential treatment as a revolutionary soldier's family. Last August, I sent the revolutionary soldier certificate uniformly issued by the Fourth Field Army, but it still had no effect.
    I believe that the Lingshi County People's Government's delaying attitude in implementing preferential treatment policies is not good. Before I communicated with my family, they excused themselves by saying "unknown whereabouts"; after I communicated with my family, they used "not a formal official letter" as an excuse; after I sent the certificate, they used "not a regular army" to prevaricate. Pushing back and forth, several years have passed. Therefore, I hope that the Lingshi County People's Government should inspect the work of implementing preferential treatment for revolutionary soldiers' families.

    Editor's note: All personnel who have obtained military status in the People's Liberation Army and the People's Public Security Forces, their families are revolutionary soldiers' families. The Lingshi County People's Government's excuse for the revolutionary soldier's family status of Comrade Wang Fulin's family, using reasons such as "non-regular army" to deliberately delay and fail to resolve it for a long time, is completely unreasonable.

　　革命军人家属已有部队证明
    灵石县府为何不给军属待遇？编辑同志：
    我家在山西省灵石县四区王家岭。贫农成份。我父亲王道显，年已六十余岁；此外，家里还有十四岁以下的三个小弟弟。
    我在一九三七年离家参加革命，现在中南军政大学工作。一九四七年，我曾和家里通信，并寄去革命军人证明书。但县人民政府负责同志却说军政大学是学校，我家不能享受革命军人家属待遇。我先后给县人民政府去了几封信，均未见回复。后来我又接家信，说家中生活很困难，政府仍未按革命军人家属给以优待。去年八月，我曾将第四野战军统一颁发的革命军人证明书寄去，仍无效果。
    我认为，灵石县人民政府在执行优抚政策中的拖延态度是不好的。在我没有和家里通信以前，他们以“不明下落”来推辞；在我和家里通信之后，又以“不是正式公函”为借口；在我寄去证书后，又以“非正规军队”来推托。推来推去，就过了好几年。因此，我希望灵石县人民政府对执行优待革命军人家属的工作，应该进行检查。

    编者按：凡人民解放军及人民公安部队中一切取得军籍的人员，其家属即为革命军人家属。灵石县人民政府对王伏林同志家属的革命军人家属资格问题，以“非正规部队”等理由为借口，有意拖延，迟迟不予解决，是完全没有道理的。
