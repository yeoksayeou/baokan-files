　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch, TASS 18th dispatch quoting the Dentsu News Agency: Tokyo sources with inside information claim that MacArthur Headquarters has formulated a plan to restore Japanese munitions production as quickly as possible. The plan stipulates the production of large quantities of tanks, armored vehicles, transport ships, artillery, machine guns, rifles, and ammunition in 1951. American engineers are guiding the adjustments to make Japanese munitions factories conform to American standards. More than three hundred of America's latest inventions have been utilized in the production of special artillery and transport ships in Japan. The cost of utilizing patent rights is paid by the Japanese government from the national budget. In accordance with MacArthur's orders, deadlines have been set for munitions manufacturing enterprises to obtain raw materials and semi-finished products. Many factories engaged in civilian production are now engaged in munitions production. Munitions factories have shifted to working day and night since January 1.
　　According to the agreement reached between MacArthur and Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese munitions industry will guarantee the necessary equipment for the Kuomintang army in Taiwan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch, according to Dentsu News Agency Hong Kong, 18th dispatch: The Japanese reactionary government is actively participating in the American aggression against Taiwan. According to a Japanese commercial representative stationed in Hong Kong: The Japanese cabinet held special meetings in the past few days to discuss ways and means of increasing the transport of war materials to the Taiwan bandits. Representatives from MacArthur Headquarters suggested at the meeting that some of Japan's former munitions factories should specialize in producing weapons and other war materials for the Kuomintang remnant bandit army. Following this meeting, certain large Japanese munitions factories, with the approval of the United States and the Yoshida government, have begun producing munitions and war materials for the Kuomintang bandit army. For example, a chemical factory in Tokyo is being completely converted into a factory producing weapons.
　　The Nagoya branch of "Toyota Automatic Loom Works" has already begun handing over parts for guns, bombs, grenades, landmines, and aerial bombs manufactured by the factory to the Chiang bandit army. The Kobe "Hitachi Manufacturing Co." has begun transporting large-caliber field guns, aircraft parts, shooting equipment, and ammunition to the Kuomintang bandit army. In order to provide the Kuomintang bandit gang with large-scale and organized weapon assistance, a "Da Zhong" (transliteration) trading company has been specially established to be solely responsible for transporting weapons and war materials to Taiwan.

　　美帝加紧武装日本
    并指使日本为台湾残匪制造军火
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社十八日电引电通社消息：东京消息灵通方面称，麦克阿瑟总部已制定尽快恢复日本军火生产的计划。计划规定一九五一年生产大量坦克、装甲车、运输舰、大炮、机关枪、步枪和弹药等。美国工程师指导着调整工作，使日本军火工厂合于美国标准。已有三百多个美国最新发明的专利权，被利用在日本的特种大炮和运输舰的生产中。利用专利权的费用，是由日本政府从国家预算内开支的。依照麦克阿瑟的命令，已给制造军火的企业规定了获得原料和半制成品的期限。许多进行民用生产的工厂，现在都进行军火生产。从一月一日起，军火工厂已转入日夜开工。
    按照麦克阿瑟与蒋介石之间所达成的协定，日本军火工业将保证台湾国民党军队必需的装备。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据电通社香港十八日讯：日本反动政府正积极参加美国侵略台湾的活动。据日本驻香港的商务代表透露：日本内阁在过去几天内曾举行特别会议，讨论增运战争物资给台匪的方式和方法。麦克阿瑟总部的代表在会议上建议使日本从前的若干军火工厂专为国民党残匪军队生产武器和其他战争物资。在这个会议之后，日本某些大的军火工厂经美国和吉田政府批准，已开始为国民党匪军生产军火和战争物资。例如，东京的化学工厂正在全部改装成为生产武器的工厂。
    “丰田自动织机制作所”名古屋分厂已经开始将该厂制造的枪支、炸弹、手榴弹、地雷和空中炸弹的零件交给蒋匪军队。神户的“日立制作所”已开始把大口径野炮、飞机零件、射击装备和弹药运交给国民党匪军。日本为了大规模地有组织地给国民党匪帮以武器援助，已经特别成立一个“大中”（译音）贸易公司，专门负责运送武器和战争物资到台湾。
