Reader's Letters

    From Shirking to Setting Records
    Letter from Zhang Huaiyu, a worker at the Jinan Railway Machinery Factory, to the Editor:
    Thinking back, I am filled with shame. I am a worker at the Jinan Railway Machinery Factory. I want to tell you about my transformation.
    In the autumn of 1948, when Jinan was about to be liberated, I listened to the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda and fled to Xuzhou. Soon, Xuzhou was also liberated, and I had no choice but to return to Jinan. After arriving in Jinan, some reactionaries spread rumors. At that time, I was confused and didn't understand what the Communist Party was all about.
    After Jinan's liberation, workers from the large factories returned to work in four groups. On November 14, 1948, the factory notified me to return to work. I didn't understand the situation but returned to work anyway. I worked eight hours a day, making eight boxes of type B brake shoes, and the quality wasn't even guaranteed. In the factory, we held meetings every day talking about democracy and workers being masters of their own house, but some backward workers shook their heads when they heard this. I couldn't continue working, and I cursed the cadres behind their backs. I just ate, drank, and slept all day, and sometimes even stole furniture from the factory to take home.
    I spent a year in a daze. In August 1949, I participated in the Yellow River control work. During the work, I was deeply moved by the exemplary actions of the cadres. For example, the person in charge, Political Commissar Zhu, proposed to everyone when the Yellow River flooded: "We will only rest after conquering the Yellow River, and we will never go home until the flood subsides." He was so old, but he still carefully inspected the dikes day and night. Sun Sixin, the head of the trade union, personally did the work of transporting supplies. During the four consecutive days of rain, the roads were muddy and difficult to travel, but he overcame all difficulties and still took care of our three meals a day. These facts made me realize that the Communist Party serves the people, so my thinking changed slightly. After returning to the factory, I discussed it with Comrade Liu Guangtai and asked to join the Youth League. On October 20th of last year, I was approved to join the League. Because I did not clearly understand the nature and tasks of the League, I was not very interested in the League's activities.
    When the higher authorities called on the factory workers to repair the "New China" passenger train in their spare time, each workshop launched a production upsurge, and I was determined to strive to be a model League member and a model Youth League member. When I increased my output to 20 to 25 boxes of type B brake shoes in eight hours, I was threatened by bad elements, who said: "Be careful, we'll meet you at the factory gate. Do you still want to live?" Later, the sand had low fire resistance, and the quality of the products was not very good. Bad elements took the opportunity to attack me. Although the chairman of the trade union and many workers comforted me and encouraged me not to bow to difficulties, my work enthusiasm plummeted. I didn't attend the League meetings eight out of ten times, thinking that League members had no "future." Later, the person in charge of the League talked to me, but I still didn't change.
    In June 1950, my wife's chronic appendicitis relapsed. Because of financial difficulties, she did not receive prompt treatment. She cried every day and didn't want to live anymore. When I came home and saw this situation, I was very sad. So I told the responsible comrades of the trade union about my difficulties. Everyone cared about me very much. The trade union lent me 200 jin of millet, and the mutual aid group lent me 80,000 yuan. As a result, my wife was hospitalized for 24 days, and her long-standing illness was completely cured. The whole family was very happy. The hospital not only cured my wife's illness, but also completely cured my father's 18-year-old chest pain. This is truly the happiness that the Communist Party has brought us. The Communist Party is truly wholeheartedly serving the people, and it is truly the political party of our working class. When I think of this, I can't stop the tears from flowing down my face. From now on, I am determined to fight for the complete liberation of the Chinese people. I must put all my strength into my work.
    On September 18, 1949, I responded to the call from the higher authorities to launch a new record movement, and took the lead in production. The standard output of type B brake shoes was 15 boxes, and I increased it to 24 boxes, then to 32 boxes, and then to 40 boxes and 44 boxes. At this time, the administrative supervisor of the factory and the foremen personally gave me a banner of excellence and a slogan, hoping that I would continue to work hard and create new records. This greatly encouraged my production enthusiasm, and I was determined to create new records.
    When I reached the record of 50 boxes, I saw in the newspaper that American imperialism was frantically invading Korea and continuing to advance towards the Yalu River, seriously threatening the safety of our motherland. My anger soared, and I wished I could immediately join the Korean People's Army to defeat the American imperialist aggressors. So I discussed it with Liu Guangtai and wanted to go to the front line to kill the enemy, and he actively supported my idea. The two of us wrote a volunteer letter, applying to go no matter what. Before it was approved, I participated in production with the slogan "Making one more brake shoe is equivalent to giving the American aggressors one more blow."
    In early December, I saw in the League publication that Comrade Wang Changhua from the Jiulong Machinery Factory had set a new record of making 80 boxes of type B brake shoes a day. I couldn't even eat my meals or sleep well. Because I had something on my mind: "How to improve even further." After discussing it with the Party, government, trade union, and League leaders and the workers in my class, everyone encouraged me to create a higher record. On the 7th, Zhang Naiyu and I decided to eliminate wasted work hours and work hard. As a result, we made 85 boxes. On the 11th, we made another challenge, and in eight hours, we made a record of 96 boxes, and we guaranteed good quality.
    During the innovation of records, my achievements were praised everywhere in the factory and in many newspapers. Photographers also came to take pictures, and I felt very ashamed when I saw it. Because my existing achievements are not enough for a Youth League member. I have decided to transform the tools and create higher records. I believe that this is entirely possible.
                                    Zhang Huaiyu, Worker, Jinan Railway Machinery Factory

　　Opinions on the Handling of Lin Jie's Case of Using Power for Personal Gain
    ——Letter from readers Wang Jinlin, et al. to the Editor:
    In the December 21st edition of the People's Daily, page 2, we read the news from the People's Supervision Committee about punishing personnel who use their power for personal gain in order to enforce discipline. We have the following opinions:
    (1) As leading cadres of state-owned enterprises, Comrade Lin Jie and others were already wrong to be engaging in private business. Furthermore, to be engaged in their own managed coal business, and to use their power to seek personal gain, is in fact a form of embezzlement. This is a violation of state laws and policies.
    (2) The state-owned enterprise's price is the leading force in the market. Its rise and fall is closely related to our trade policy. Comrade Lin Jie dared to fill in the wrong dates and lower the prices at will, causing losses to the people's property and disrupting the state's price policy. From this, it can be inferred that there must also be some problems with the company's accounting books, otherwise it would be impossible to fill in the wrong dates when settling accounts every month.
    (3) The government has clearly prohibited the transportation of Beijing coal to the south. Comrade Lin Jie dared to violate the law in the name of the military region to seek personal gain. This is a manifestation of disorganization and lack of discipline. Zheng Daqi, the head of the business section, was also engaged in business for personal gain and abused his power, but Comrade Lin Jie knew about it and did not ask, intentionally shielding him. Such mutual cover-up should be considered collective corruption.
    A leading cadre who has committed such a fundamental mistake is unwilling to humbly examine his own mistakes and accept criticism. The Supervision Committee only gave him two major demerits. We think this is too lenient. The publication of this matter in the newspaper is to educate other working comrades, but such a punishment will not only not have an educational effect, but may also have a bad influence. We believe that Comrade Lin Jie should at least be dismissed from his post and investigated, and the proceeds of his profits should be recovered. If Comrade Lin Jie can sincerely review and admit his mistakes afterwards, he should also be demoted.
                                   Wang Jinlin, Chen Zhongjie, Li Chunyang

    Relevant departments should recover and process revolutionary documents left in various places due to the war environment. Letter to the editor:
    The chairman of the farmers' association in Menxinzhuang Village, Fengnan County, Hebei Province, sold hundreds of copies of confidential Party documents that had been left in his home by a rear hospital of our army during the war environment because they were inconvenient to carry. Fortunately, they were discovered and recovered by the local troops. This kind of incident should attract the attention of all localities. We suggest that the leaders of the county should deal with the chairman of the farmers' association appropriately. We also hope that relevant departments in various places will conduct investigations and uniformly recover and process (submit or incinerate by responsible authorities) the documents and materials that revolutionary cadres left in the local area due to the inconvenience of carrying them during the past war environment. All troops, organizations, and individuals should also try to recover the documents that were left in various places in the past, or notify the local government to take care of them on their behalf, to prevent similar incidents from happening.

　　The Beijing Tram Company Cooperative should be rectified, Letter to the editor:
    I know that the workers' cooperative of the Beijing Tram Company has had all kinds of bad phenomena such as violating the state's cash management system, usual accounting system, and embezzlement and dereliction of duty. Now I will reflect some of the facts I know to you, and ask you to find ways to investigate and understand, so as to prompt the relevant authorities to pay attention to this matter and deal with it.
    The workers' cooperative of the Beijing Tram Company is one of the larger cooperatives in the city. Such a cooperative should be better managed, but it has many problems, which have only been exposed recently. For example, the legal inventory of the cooperative is 500,000 yuan per day, but the actual inventory often exceeds this amount. At the same time, the cooperative, in the name of purchasing stationery for needs, once retained 1.2 million yuan in circulation for a month. They also often used blank checks, and temporarily filled in the amount after the transaction. This is a violation of accounting procedures. For example, the Tongxian Cooperative deposited 660 jin of millet in the cooperative the year before last. People came to claim it back last October, but no one knew where it was stored. Comrade Jiao Zongmo, the director of the cooperative, and the cashier discussed it and issued a check to pay it. Someone disagreed with this and asked to check the accounts first. Director Jiao said, it's not like taking it home anyway, so just use the miscellaneous loss category. Because of insisting on checking the accounts, it was found that 660 jin of millet had been received in the goods account the year before last, and 300 jin had been reported as a loss in February last year. The cooperative lost 300 jin of millet invisibly.
    The director of the cooperative also used the cooperative's name to approve 1,000 jin of rice from the supply and marketing cooperative and transferred it to the private merchant Southern Sauce Garden (on Diplomatic Street), and approved coal fines from the Coal and Iron Company to be processed for private merchants. The manager of the coal shop often interacted with the cooperative and purchased goods on credit, and the economic procedures were unclear.
    Whether the cooperative has other more serious problems remains to be investigated and understood in depth, but based on these facts alone, I think it is also necessary to pay attention to it and deal with it seriously. I especially ask the relevant authorities to thoroughly investigate and deal with it.
                                                    A Reader

　　Why doesn't the Xingtai Municipal Government recognize my family as military dependents? Letter to the editor:
    On December 1, 1947, I was introduced by the Xingtai Normal School to study at the Communications School of the Jinji-Luyu Military Region. In December, I sent the military dependents certificate home and handed it over to the Xingtai City Xiguan Street Government. Unexpectedly, the street chief lost the letter. Until December 1949, the Xingtai Municipal Government still did not recognize my family as military dependents. So my family and the street chief Wang Yueliang wrote to me, telling me that the former street chief had lost the letter and asking me to issue another certificate. At that time, I was working in the Fifth Company of the First Brigade of the Beijing Disciplinary Corps, so I issued a certificate and sent it to Xingtai. I thought this problem would be solved. But unexpectedly, until now, the Xingtai Municipal Government still does not recognize my family as military dependents. The other day, my family wrote to me again asking me to issue a certificate.
    I think it is not good for the Xingtai Municipal Government to not pay attention to military dependents like this. I hope you will urge them to improve.
                                              Liu Huaizhong, stationed in Tanggu, a certain unit

　　从消极怠工到创新纪录
    济南铁路机厂工人张怀玉来信编辑同志：
    回想起往事，真使我非常惭愧。我是济南铁路机厂的工人。我现在把我的转变过程告诉你。
    一九四八年秋济南将要解放时，我听信了国民党的反动宣传，逃到徐州。很快徐州又解放了，我没法，只得重回济南。到济南后，有些反动分子造谣，这时我模模糊糊，不知道共产党是怎么回事。
    济南解放后，大厂的职工分四批复工。一九四八年十一月十四日，厂里通知我复工。我也不了解情况就复了工。我入厂工作，每天八小时做乙型闸瓦八箱，质量还不保险。在厂里，每天开会讲民主，讲工人当家做主人，一部分落后工人听了都摇头。我工作也干不下去，见干部就背后骂，每天胡吃闷睡，有时还从厂里偷点家具回家。
    一年的时光，我糊里糊涂过去了。一九四九年八月，我参加了治黄河的工作。在工作中，干部的模范行动真使我感动。如负责人朱政委在黄水暴涨的时候，向大家提出：“战胜黄水，才肯休息，黄水不减，决不回家。”他那么大年纪了，还不分日夜的仔细巡视堤防。工会负责人孙思新亲自做运输给养的工作，在连下四天雨的过程中，道路泥泞难行，他却克服了一切困难，仍照顾到我们一日三餐。这些事实使我认识到共产党是为人民服务的，因此我的思想稍有转变。回厂后，我和团员刘广泰商量，要求入团。去年十月二十日，我被批准入了团。由于我未明确认识团的性质和任务，对团的活动很不感兴趣。
    上级号召本厂工友业余抢修新中国号机客车，各场展开了生产热潮，我决心争取做个模范会员模范团员。当我把产量提高到八小时做乙型闸瓦二十箱至二十五箱的时候，我就受到坏分子的恐吓，说：“你要小心点，厂门口见面，你还想活吗？”后来砂子的耐火性低，做的质量不很好，坏分子就乘机打击我，虽有工会主席和许多工友安慰我，鼓励我不要向困难低头，但我工作情绪一落千丈。团的会议十次有八次不参加，认为团员没有什么“出路”。以后团的负责人和我谈话，结果我也没有转变。
    一九五○年六月，我老婆慢性盲肠炎复发，因为生活困难，没有很快的治疗，每天哭哭啼啼，不想活下去了。我回家后看到了这样情形，真是难过极了。于是我把我困难情况告诉了工会负责同志。大家很关心我，工会借给我小米二百斤，互助组借给我八万元。结果我老婆住院二十四天，数年的陈病全愈，全家的人都非常高兴。医院不仅治好了我老婆的病，连我父亲十八年的心口疼病也完全治好了。这真是共产党给我们带来的幸福。共产党真是全心全意为人民服务，真是我们工人阶级的政党。我回想到这里，眼中的热泪止不住的流下来了。从今以后，我决心为中国人民彻底解放而奋斗。我一定要在自己岗位上，把所有力量拿出来。
    一九四九年九月十八日，我响应了上级开展新纪录运动的号召，在生产上起了带头作用，做乙型闸瓦由标准产量十五箱做到二十四箱直至三十二箱，后来又由三十二箱继续提高到四十箱、四十四箱。这时，本厂行政主管以及各工长亲自送给我一面优胜旗，还有一幅标语，希望我再接再厉再创新纪录。这大大鼓舞我的生产情绪，决心再创新纪录。
    当我达到五十箱纪录时，我从报纸上看到美帝疯狂侵略朝鲜，继续向鸭绿江边进攻，严重威胁我们祖国安全的消息。我火气直升，恨不得与朝鲜人民军一起立刻打垮美帝侵略军。于是我和刘广泰商量到前线杀敌去，他也积极支持我的意见。我们俩人就写了志愿书，申请非去不可。在没有批准之前，我以“多做一块闸瓦，就等于多给美国侵略者一个打击”的口号，参加生产。
    十二月初，我看到团刊上刊着九龙机厂汪长华同志日作乙型闸瓦八十箱的新纪录，我连饭也吃不下去，觉也睡不好。因为我有心事：“如何再提高一步。”经过我与党、政、工、团负责人和本班工友商量，大家鼓励我创更高地纪录。七日，我和张乃玉决定消灭浪费工时，使劲的干，结果做出了八十五箱。十一日，我俩又提出挑战，在八小时内就做出了九十六箱的纪录，而且保证质量好。
    在创新纪录当中，厂内各处和许多报上都表扬我的成绩，摄影员也来摄影，我看了非常惭愧。因为我已有的成绩，对一个青年团员来说，是不能满足的。我已决定要改造工具，创出更高的纪录，我自己相信这是完全能够做到的。

　　对林洁利用职权营私图利案处理的意见
    ——读者王金林等来信编辑同志：
    人民日报十二月二十一日第二版登载人民监察委员会为严明法纪，处分利用职权营私图利人员的消息，我们有以下的意见：
    （一）林洁同志等身为国营企业负责干部，经营私人商业已属不当，而又经营自己所辖的煤炭业务，利用职权图谋私利，实系变相贪污。这是违犯国家法纪与违犯政策的行为。
    （二）国营企业的牌价是在市场中起领导作用的。它的升降，均和我们的贸易政策有密切的关系，林洁同志竟敢倒填月日，随意降低，使人民财产受到损失，破坏了国家的物价政策，由此可推知该公司会计账目，也一定有些问题，否则每月结账倒填月日是不可能的。
    （三）政府明令禁止京煤南运，林洁同志竟敢假借军区名义违犯法令，图谋私利，这是无组织无纪律的表现。业务科长郑大器亦营商图利，假公济私，但林洁同志却知而不问，有意袒护。这样相互包庇，应该算是集体贪污。
    一个领导干部所犯的这种原则性的错误，不肯虚心检讨自己的错误，来接受批评，而监察委员会只给予记大过二次处分，我们认为有些过轻。这件事发表在报纸上，是用以教育其他工作同志，但是这样的处分，不但不起教育作用，可能还会有坏的影响。我们认为对林洁同志的处分，至少应当撤职查办，并追回营利所得款项。如果林洁同志事后已能诚恳检讨承认错误的话，亦应受到降级的处分。

    战争环境存留各地革命文件有关机关应该收回处理编辑同志：
    河北丰南县门辛庄村农会主任，把过去战斗环境时我军某部后方医院因携带不便而存在他家的党内机密文件数百本在大街出卖。幸经当地部队查获收回。这种事件，应该引起各地注意。我们建议该县领导上对该农会主任应作适当处理。并希望各地有关部门进行调查，把在过去战争环境中，革命干部因携带不便而存在本地的文件、物资，统一收回处理（上交或由负责机关焚销）。各部队、机关、个人，亦应把过去存在各地的文件设法收回，或通知所在地政府代为妥收，以防类似事件发生。

　　京市电车公司合作社应加整顿编辑同志：
    我知道本市电车公司工人合作社，发生违反国家现金管理制度、通常会计制度、以及贪污渎职种种不良现象。现在将我所知道的一些事实反映给你，请你设法调查了解，以促起有关机关注意此事，加以处理。
    北京市电车公司工人合作社，是本市合作社中比较大型的一个。这样的合作社，应该更好地经营，但是它却存在着许多问题，直到最近才暴露出来。比如：该合作社法定的库存是每日五十万元，但实际库存时常超过此数。同时，该社以购备文具需用为名，曾经留用一百二十万元流动一月之久。他们并经常使用空白支票，货物成交之后，临时填上金额。这是违反会计手续的行为。又如，通县合作社前年曾存该社小米六百六十斤，去年十月来人索还，大家都不知存在那里，而该社主任焦宗谟同志和出纳商议好，就开支票付给。有人不同意这样作，要求先查清帐目。焦主任说，反正不是往家拿，就出杂损的科目好了。因为坚持查帐，结果，在前年货品帐里收过六百六十斤小米，去年二月一次报了亏损三百斤。无形中该社损失了三百斤小米。
    该社主任，并曾利用合作社名义向供销总社批来大米一千斤，转批给私商南方酱园（在外交部街），以煤铁公司批来煤末，给私商加工。煤铺经理并经常到该社交往，赊购货物，经济手续不清。
    该社是否还有其他更严重问题，还须要深入调查了解，而就以这些事实来说，我认为也有加以重视、严正处理的必要，特转请有关机关彻查处理。

　　邢台市府为什么不承认我家是军属？编辑同志：
    我在一九四七年十二月一日由邢台师范学校介绍到晋冀鲁豫军区通讯学校学习。十二月间，我将军属证明信寄回家去，并交邢台市西关街政府。不料，街长竟把该信遗失。直到一九四九年十二月，邢台市政府仍未承认我家是军属。于是家中和街长王月亮给我来信，将前任街长丢信事告知我，让我再开证明信。当时我在北京市纠察总队一大队五中队工作，就开了封证明信寄往邢台。这样我以为这一问题就解决了。但不料直到现在，邢台市政府仍不认我家是军属。前两天，家中来信又要我开证明信。
    我认为邢台市政府对军属这样不重视是不好的，希望你们督促他们改进。
