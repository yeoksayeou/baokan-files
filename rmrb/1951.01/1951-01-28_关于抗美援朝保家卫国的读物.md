On Readings About Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Safeguarding the Home, and Defending the Nation
	Wang Cheng

The patriotic mass movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the nation has been enthusiastically launched in vast areas across the country. The publishing industry has also made many efforts in this movement. Whether writers or public and private publishers, all have strived to write and publish a relatively large number of readings on resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the nation. Although higher demands can be made on the quality and quantity of these readings, the definite role played by the publishing industry’s efforts should be affirmed first.

As we continue to expand and deepen the patriotic movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the nation today, it is very necessary to conduct a study on the readings in this area.

From September 1950 to the present, the country has published more than ninety general readings on resisting America and aiding Korea that we have seen (excluding literary and popular readings). For the sake of clarity, these ninety-plus readings can be divided into two categories: single volumes and series. Let's first talk about the single-volume readings.

There are thirty-one single-volume readings, of which the following five are comprehensive: "How to Understand the United States" (originally published in "Current Affairs Handbook"), "Understanding the 'Paper Tiger' U.S. Imperialism" (originally published in the Northeast-published "Propaganda Mobilization Handbook"), "Critiquing Erroneous Views on the Current Situation" (distributed by Xinhua Bookstore Northwest General Branch), "Mobilize to Resist America, Aid Korea, Safeguard the Home, and Defend the Nation" (published by Hebei People's Publishing House), "Dissecting the United States" (compiled and printed by Nanjing People's Daily), and "U.S. Imperialism's Conspiracy to Launch: The Korean War and the Third World War!" (compiled by Zhang Ye and Sang Ya, printed by Shanghai China Book Magazine Company). The various readings listed above have played a great role in propaganda and mobilization in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard the home, and defend the nation, especially the first two readings, which have had a particularly huge impact. The reason is: the content can clearly raise and answer the questions that readers are most concerned about and need to know most, the mobilization is strong, the writing is relatively concise, and the text is relatively popular. Therefore, among the readings on resisting America and aiding Korea published throughout the country, the first two articles have been reprinted many times, and it is conceivable that they are popular with readers.

However, these readings are not without shortcomings. Taking the article "How to Understand the United States," which has the greatest impact and has been reprinted the most, as an example, when explaining the issue of "despising the United States because it is a paper tiger," it tells readers that: U.S. imperialism is politically isolated; there are many weaknesses in the military; although U.S. imperialism has resource advantages (mainly steel), the proportion of steel production cannot determine the proportion of weapons production; the boasting of the atomic bomb is just to intimidate the people of all countries. All of these are correct. But here it does not mention the economic crisis of U.S. imperialism. This point is very important in answering the question of why the U.S. Empire is a "paper tiger." We must fully explain this point in order to fully explain the truth of why the U.S. Empire is a "paper tiger."

The book "Mobilize to Resist America, Aid Korea, Safeguard the Home, and Defend the Nation" is also worth recommending to readers. Its strong mobilization ability and ability to combine with reality, as well as its systematic, concise, lively, and vibrant writing style, are the most prominent advantages of this book. It starts with "The Beloved Motherland," explaining how lovely the motherland is; then it explains that the lovely motherland has "suffered humiliation and sins" for more than a hundred years. Fortunately, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have stood up, but "the construction of the new China has just begun," and the American bandits have ignited the flames of war in Korea; then it explains why we "cannot ignore" the Korean War; further pointing out that "the U.S. Empire has been our enemy" for more than a hundred years, and not only that, the U.S. Empire is also "the enemy of the people of the world," and then analyzing why the U.S. Empire is a "paper tiger" and "what is the atomic bomb"; finally, it concludes with "Mobilize! Resist America, Aid Korea, Safeguard the Home, and Defend the Nation!" How to mobilize? The editors specifically pointed out the practical actions that should be taken, such as "strengthening unity, actively producing," "raising vigilance, suppressing counter-revolutionary activities," and "rectifying work style, closely uniting with the broad masses of people." In this way, the editors wrote the great content of the Chinese people's patriotic movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the nation in a popular and complete way. Although this book also has some material errors and technical shortcomings, it is generally successful. It is suitable for county-level cadres and general propagandists to read and is a good book.

Among the single-volume readings on resisting America and aiding Korea, those with better content on exposing the true face of U.S. imperialism include: "American Way of Life" (published by Times Press), "The So-Called American Way of Life" (written by Froumski, published by World Knowledge Press), "Rotten America" (compiled by Wang Qing, published by Labor Publishing House), "Look, This is America!" (written by Yan Yu, printed by Qunlian Publishing House), "Crimes in America" (written by Herzensohn, published by People's Publishing House), and "American Schools and the Crisis of Education" (published by Times Press), etc. There were already several books on the history of U.S. imperialism's invasion of China. Recently, Guangming Daily published "Historical Facts of the Early Stage of U.S. Imperialism's Invasion of China" (written by Gao Yihan et al.) and "A Historical Account of U.S. Imperialism's Aggression Against China" (written by the History Department Group of the Teachers College). Both books put forward new historical materials. Mr. Situ Meitang's "I Hate U.S. Imperialism," which was serialized in Guangming Daily, is a reading that correctly and vividly reflects the patriotic overseas Chinese's deep-seated hatred of U.S. imperialism. In addition, "Resist the American Aggressors" (written by Liao Gailong), published by Haiyan Publishing House, focuses on exposing in detail the crimes of U.S. imperialism's invasion of China after 1945 and should also be recommended to readers.

Most of the single-volume readings on resisting America and aiding Korea are compiled from articles in newspapers and magazines. This work is necessary to cooperate with the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

We have seen fourteen series of books, a total of sixty-one volumes, systematically published for the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Most of these fourteen series are compiled, followed by written and compiled, and fewer are written. First of all, the "Small Series on Resisting America and Aiding Korea" published by People's Publishing House is worth introducing. As of recently, this small series has published fourteen volumes, and others are still being published. Generally speaking, this small series is compiled more systematically and is suitable for readers above the middle level. Although some small errors have been found in individual books, it is basically successful. Another series of books that are widely sold and have a greater impact among the compiled series is the "Current Affairs Small Series" printed by the Youth Publishing House. The characteristic of this small series is that it is relatively popular, with a few thousand words in a book, discussing one issue. Among them, books such as "Opposing Rumors," "Opposing Yiguandao," and "Participating in the Militia to Defend the Homeland" can be combined with the actual work in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard the home, and defend the nation, and the writing style also has advantages, making them relatively successful readings. However, the book "Why U.S. Imperialism is a Paper Tiger" only explains it from a military perspective, which is also very insufficient. Among the compiled series, we should also mention a set of "Current Affairs Learning Materials" compiled and printed by the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This set of books covers a wider range of topics, uses concise materials, and some books have rich materials, such as "Korea is China's Close Neighbor and Comrade-in-Arms in Times of Trouble," in which some historical materials are relatively valuable.

World Knowledge Press has published two series of books on resisting America and aiding Korea, one is "International Current Affairs Learning Materials" and the other is "Current Affairs Learning Materials," both of which contain new works. Generally speaking, these two series of books are not badly written, and some are very well written, such as Deng Chao's "The Weaknesses of U.S. Imperialism in the Military" and Deng Pu, Ma Wen, and others' "Evidence of U.S. Imperialism's Invasion of Shanghai." These books should also be recommended to readers.

Some series of books are compiled by editing articles from newspapers and magazines according to the nature of the issues, that is, collecting articles discussing the same issue into one book. The series compiled and printed by the East China General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore is relatively systematic.

In general, the publishing industry's work on publishing general readings on resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the nation needs to be further strengthened, so that our work can move further forward in terms of both depth and breadth. For example, on the issue of U.S. imperialism being a paper tiger, more complete readings need to be published, which is very necessary for recognizing that U.S. imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak and for eliminating fear of the United States; also, on the historical facts of U.S. imperialism's invasion of China and the history and geography of Korea, materials should be collected and more in-depth research should be conducted; furthermore, our publications are currently limited to general propaganda appeals, and cannot well reflect and guide the rich content of actual struggles, thus appearing superficial. In terms of these already published publications, the aspects are not broad enough, and they do not well reflect the problems of all aspects and the struggles of people from all walks of life. For example, there is only one book published by October Publishing House that reflects the patriotic enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial sectors in this movement to resist America and aid Korea, "How U.S. Imperialism Destroys Our Industry and Commerce," and there is also a lack of publications that reflect the patriotic enthusiasm of workers, peasants, and laboring people, and there is a great lack of publications that reflect the struggles of the people in imperialist countries. In terms of the target audience, it is also very general, and there is a lot of repetition in the content, and the textual forms are not diversified enough. How to reduce repeated publications, write more profound readings suitable for various target audiences, and study these issues is worth studying. Furthermore, judging from the publishing areas, the development is also uneven. There are more publications in North China, East China, and Northeast China, while there are fewer in Southwest China, Northwest China, and Central South China. Of course, there are objective difficulties, but we need to work hard to overcome them.

The continued deepening and expansion of the movement to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard the home, and defend the nation, and the arrival of a new upsurge of patriotism among the Chinese people, have put forward new and higher demands on the publishing industry. In addition to publishing some readings directly related to resisting America and aiding Korea and improving the quality of these readings, it requires us to publish other related patriotic and internationalist readings, requires us to publish readings that can express the spirit of patriotism, inspire patriotic enthusiasm, and express the historical and political status of the Chinese people, requires us to publish readings that can reflect the excellent qualities and fighting spirit of the Chinese people, requires us to publish readings that can reflect the superiority of the new democratic regime and the construction of the new China. In order to play a greater role in the patriotic movement, the writing and publishing circles should make greater efforts to fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to us by history.

　　关于抗美援朝保家卫国的读物
    王城
    抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义的群众运动，已在全国广大地区热烈地开展起来。出版界在这一运动中，也作了许多努力，不论作家、公私营出版家，都努力写作了和出版了比较大量的抗美援朝保家卫国的读物。这些读物，就质与量说来，虽然还可以要求更高一点，但出版界这种努力所起的一定作用，是首先应该肯定的。
    正当今天我们继续扩大和深入抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义运动的时候，对这方面读物作一研讨，是很必要的。
    从一九五○年九月以后到目前为止，全国出版的关于抗美援朝的一般读物，就我们业已看到的，有九十多本（文艺和通俗读物不在此内），为便于说明起见，可以把这九十多本读物分做两类：一类是单行本，一类是丛书。现在先让我们谈一谈单行本的读物。
    单行本的读物有三十一本，其中属于综合性的有下列五种：即《怎样认识美国》（原载《时事手册》）、《认识〈纸老虎〉美帝国主义》（原载东北出版的《宣传鼓动手册》）、《批判对时局的错误看法》（新华书店西北总分店发行）、《动员起来抗美援朝保家卫国》（河北人民出版社出版）、《解剖美国》（南京人报编印）及《美帝国主义阴谋发动的：朝鲜战争与第三次世界大战！》（张掖、桑矢编著、上海中国图书杂志公司印行）。以上列举的各种读物，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，引起了很大的宣传鼓动作用，特别是前两本读物，影响尤其巨大。其原因在：内容能够明确提出和解答读者所最关心和最需要知道的问题，鼓动性强，写法相当精炼，文字也比较通俗。因此，在全国出版的抗美援朝的读物中，前两篇文章被转载的很多，其受读者欢迎，可以想见。
    然而，在这种读物中，并不是全无缺点的。拿影响最大、被转载最多的《怎样认识美国》一文说，在说明“蔑视美国，因为它是纸老虎”这个问题时，它告诉了读者：美帝国主义在政治上是孤立的；军事上弱点很多；美帝国主义虽有资源优势（主要是钢铁），但钢产量的比例并不能决定武器生产的比例；原子弹的吹嘘只不过是恐吓各国人民的。这些都是对的。但这里却没有说到美帝国主义在经济上的危机。这一点在解答何以美帝是“纸老虎”这个问题上，是非常重要的。我们必须充分说明这一点，才能完整地说明为什么美帝是“纸老虎”的这个真理。
    《动员起来抗美援朝保家卫国》一书，也值得向读者推荐。鼓动性强，能够结合实际，在文字上，也做到了系统简洁、生动、活泼的程度，这些是本书的最突出的优点。它先从《可爱的祖国》谈起，说明祖国多么可爱；接着说明可爱的祖国却在近百多年来“受尽了侮辱，受尽了罪”，可庆幸的是在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民已经站起来了，但“新中国的建设刚开头”，美国强盗却燃起了侵朝战火；然后又说明我们何以对朝鲜战争“不能置之不理”的种种道理；进一步又指出百多年来“美帝就是我们的仇敌”，不仅如此，美帝还是“全世界人民的敌人”，更进而分析何以美帝是“纸老虎”，“原子弹是怎么回事”；最后总结到“动员起来！抗美援朝保家卫国！”如何动员起来呢？编者具体指出应该“加强团结，积极生产”、“提高警惕，镇压反革命活动”、“整顿作风，密切与广大人民团结”等等实际行动方法。编者就这样把中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义运动的伟大内容，通俗而完整地写了出来。这本书虽然也有一些材料上的错误与技术性的缺点，但总的说来是成功的。它适合于县级干部及一般宣传员阅读，是一本好书。
    在单行本的抗美援朝读物中，关于暴露美帝国主义真象的，内容较好的有：《美国生活方式》（时代社出版），《所谓美国生活方式》（夫隆斯基著、世界知识社出版），《腐烂的美国》（王青编著、劳动出版社出版），《看，这就是美国！》（燕羽著、群联出版社印行），《在美国的犯罪行为》（赫尔岑逊著、人民出版社出版）与《美国学校与教育的危机》（时代社出版）等。关于美帝侵华史的书，原已有几本，新近光明日报出版了《美帝侵华初期史实》（高一涵等著）和《美帝侵略中国史话》（师大历史系小组），这两本书都提出了新的史料。在光明日报上连载过的司徒美堂先生的《我痛恨美帝》，是正确地、有血有肉地反映了爱国华侨对美帝国主义深远的敌忾心的读物。此外，海燕出版社出版的《反抗美国侵略者》（廖盖隆著），重点在详尽地揭露一九四五年后美帝侵华的罪行，也是应该向读者推荐的。
    单行本的抗美援朝的读物，大多数是搜集报章杂志上的文章编成的。为了配合抗美援朝的运动，这种工作是需要的。
    为抗美援朝运动而有系统地出版的丛书，我们所看到的有十四种，共六十一本。这十四种丛书，大部分是编的，其次是编写的，著作的较少。首先，人民出版社出版的《抗美援朝小丛书》是值得介绍的。这套小丛书截至最近为止，已出版了十四本，其他尚在继续出版中。这套小丛书一般说来，编写得比较有系统，适合中等以上的读者阅读，虽然已发现个别书中有若干小错误，但基本上是成功的。在编写的丛书中销路较广、影响较大的另一种丛书，要算青年出版社印行的《时事小丛书》了。这套小丛书的特点是比较通俗，几千字一本书，谈一个问题，其中象《反对谣言》、《反对一贯道》与《参加民兵保卫家乡》等书，能结合抗美援朝保家卫国运动中的实际工作来谈，写法也有优点，是比较成功的读物。不过象《美帝为什么是纸老虎》一书，只从军事方面说明，也是非常不够的。在编写的丛书中，还应该提出中国人民解放军第四野战军政治部编印的一套《时事学习材料》。这套书所谈的方面较广，取材简明，有些书所搜集的材料也丰富，如《朝鲜是中国人民亲密的邻邦，共患难的战友》一书，其中的一些史料是比较宝贵的。
    世界知识社关于抗美援朝出了两套丛书，一是《国际时事学习资料》，一是《时事学习资料》，所收的都是新的作品。这两套丛书，一般说都写得不差，而且有几本写得很好。如邓超著的《美帝军事上的弱点》及邓普、玛文等著的《美帝侵略上海的罪证》等书即是，这些书也是该向读者推荐的。
    有的丛书是把报章杂志上的文章按问题性质编辑成书的，就是把谈同一问题的文章，搜集成一书。这种丛书，要算新华书店华东总分店编印的一套较有系统。
    总的说来，出版界关于抗美援朝保家卫国的一般读物的出版工作，需要更进一步的努力。使自己的工作，无论在深度和广度方面，能够向前更进一步。例如，关于美帝是纸老虎这个问题，还需要出版较完整的读物，这对于认识美帝外强中干及消除恐美病是非常必要的；又如，关于美帝侵华的史实和朝鲜的史地，应该分门别类的搜集材料，做较深入的研究；再如，我们的出版物目前限于一般宣传号召的较多，还不能很好的反映与指导实际斗争的丰富内容，因此显得浮泛。就这些已出版的出版物说，方面还不够广，还没有很好的反映各方面的问题及各阶层人民的斗争。例如反映工商界在这次抗美援朝运动中的爱国主义热情的，只有十月出版社出版的一本《美帝怎样摧残我国工商业》，反映工农劳动人民爱国热情的出版物，也是缺少的，反映帝国主义国家内人民的斗争的出版物，也极感不足。就读者对象说，也很笼统，而且内容重复的很多，文字形式也不够多样化。如何减少重复出版，写作比较深刻和适合各种读者对象的读物，是值得研究的。再就出版的地区来看，发展也是不平衡的。在华北、华东和东北出版物较多，而西南、西北及中南则较少。这当然有客观的困难，但却需要我们努力克服。
    抗美援朝保家卫国运动的继续深入与扩大，在中国人民中形成爱国主义的新高潮的到来，向出版界提出了新的更高的要求。它要求我们除了出版一些直接与抗美援朝有关的读物，提高这些读物的质量以外，并出版其他方面的有关爱国主义与国际主义的读物，要求我们出版足以表现爱国主义精神，激发爱国主义热忱，表现中国人民的历史地位与政治地位的读物，要求我们出版足以反映中国人民的优秀品质与奋斗精神的读物，要求我们出版足以反映新民主主义政权的优越性与新中国的建设的读物。为了在爱国主义运动中发挥更大的作用，著作界、出版界应该用更大的努力完成历史所赋予我们的责任。
