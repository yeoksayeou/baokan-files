Severely Punish the Stubborn and Unrepentant Heads of Yiguandao

On December 19th of last year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued a proclamation banning Yiguandao. In the twenty days since, a number of key figures have been arrested, those above the rank of altar master have been ordered to register, and extensive propaganda work has been carried out. Deceived followers have consciously launched a movement to withdraw from the Dao, and many followers have demanded to settle accounts with the Dao leaders for the money they were swindled out of and to recover the "Dao fees" they paid upon joining. As of the 8th of this month, more than 98,000 followers have voluntarily withdrawn from the Dao, and more than 2,800 people above the rank of altar master have registered. This has inflicted a devastating blow to the Yiguandao organization and its ideological influence in Beijing. The broad masses of people have unanimously expressed their support for this measure by the government.

However, a small number of reactionary Dao leaders have shown no sign of repentance in the past twenty days. Some have resisted registration, while others have falsely registered or falsely confessed, and continue to engage in open or covert sabotage activities. In recent days, they have presumptuously imagined that the work of banning Yiguandao is about to pass, and their activities have become even more rampant. As a result, they have issued a "Draft Plan for Long-Term Concealed Activities" and "Nineteen Articles for Coping with Demonic Tests," forcing their lower-level leaders to "act deaf and mute" and "answer irrelevantly," even making these lower-level leaders sacrifice their lives for them. They have also threatened the general followers on a large scale, obstructing and sabotaging the ongoing registration work and withdrawal movement. Therefore, the government arrested another twenty-seven stubborn and unrepentant Yiguandao leaders on the 9th. This measure is entirely necessary and is the urgent demand of the broad masses and followers.

The People's Government has repeatedly stated that reactionary secret societies and fraternities will be severely banned. The government will severely punish all reactionary Dao leaders who are stubborn and unrepentant, taking the People's Government's lenient policy as something to be exploited. Therefore, those reactionary Dao leaders who are still obsessed and continue to be enemies of the people will only be digging their own graves.

Some individuals above the rank of altar master have been deeply poisoned ideologically in the past, and are now temporarily unable to break free from the threats of reactionary Dao leaders, and therefore have shown hesitation. These people should understand that the policy of the People's Government is very definite and clear, as it was in the past during the registration of reactionary party and group members, and as it is now in the work of banning Yiguandao. Therefore, they should trust the government's laws and actions, rely on the government, and resolutely break free from the deception and threats of reactionary Dao leaders to start anew.

Those above the rank of altar master in Yiguandao, as well as all followers, should immediately act according to the government's proclamation, register, and surrender the organization. Those who dare to continue to do evil will be subjected to heavy blows by the people and the government until Yiguandao is completely eradicated.

### 严惩怙恶不悛的一贯道道首

　　严惩怙恶不悛的一贯道道首
    去年十二月十九日，北京市人民政府发布了取缔一贯道的布告，二十天来，因为逮捕了一批首要分子，命令坛主以上的分子进行了登记，并进行了广泛的宣传工作，受欺骗的道徒自觉地展开了退道运动，并有许多道徒要求向道首清算被骗财物，追回入道时所交的“道费”。截至本月八日止，已有九万八千多名道徒自动退道，二千八百多名坛主以上的分子进行了登记，使北京市的一贯道组织及其思想影响，受到了摧毁性的打击，广大群众对于政府的这一措施，一致表示拥护。
    但是，有少数反动道首，在二十天的过程中，毫无悔过的表示，他们或则抗拒登记，或则假登记，假坦白，仍继续进行着公开的或隐蔽的破坏活动。近几天来，他们侥幸地设想取缔一贯道的工作即将过去，活动更趋猖獗。于是，他们发出了“长期隐蔽活动计划草案”，“应付魔考十九条”，硬让他们的小头目“装聋作哑”，“答非所问”，甚至让这些小头目以自己的身家性命来为他们作牺牲。对于一般道徒，则大肆威胁，阻挠与破坏正在进行的登记工作与退道运动。因此，政府又于九日逮捕了二十七名怙恶不悛的一贯道道首。这种措施是完全必要的，这是广大群众与道徒的迫切要求。
    人民政府一再申明，对于反动会道门，一定加以严厉取缔。凡是以人民政府的宽大政策为可欺的怙恶不悛的反动道首，政府一定予以严惩。因此，那些执迷不悟的反动道首，如果依然与人民为敌，只能是自寻绝路。
    有些坛主以上的分子，过去受了很深的思想毒害，而现在又暂时摆脱不开反动道首的威胁，因而表现了犹豫。这些人应该了解，人民政府的政策是十分肯定而明确的，过去在进行对反动党团分子的登记工作中是如此，现在在取缔一贯道的工作中也是如此。因此，他们应该相信政府的法令与行动，依靠政府，坚决摆脱反动道首的欺骗与威胁，从新做人。
    一贯道坛主以上的分子，以及所有道徒，应立即根据政府的布告来决定自己的行动，进行登记，交出组织。那些敢于继续作恶的，人民和政府将以沉重的打击加在他们身上，直到彻底肃清一贯道为止。
