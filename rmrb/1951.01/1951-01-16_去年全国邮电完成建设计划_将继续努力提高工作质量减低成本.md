　　Last Year National Postal and Telecommunications Completed Construction Plan
    Will Continue to Strive to Improve Work Quality and Reduce Costs
    [Report from this newspaper] Under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, and through the efforts of all postal and telecommunications employees, the national postal and telecommunications work in 1950 has made many achievements. The national postal and telecommunications organizations have changed the long-term separation that existed in 1950. Organizational leadership, personnel, equipment, finance, and business have all been unified, realizing the principles of "centralized leadership, professional division of labor, and the integration of postal and telecommunications," thereby ensuring the completion of the annual production plan and basic construction plan. In terms of revenue, the postal service completed 107.6% of its plan, and telecommunications completed 104% of its plan. The speed of postal mail delivery has greatly improved. For example, comparing the average delivery time of letters sent from Beijing to various places in October with January, delivery to Fuzhou was accelerated by five and a half days, to Guangzhou by three days, to Chengdu by five days, to Yichang by six and a half days, and to Liuzhou by two and a half days. In telecommunications, a widespread campaign to eliminate errors has been launched and has been effective. The percentage of errors in telegrams at all levels has decreased as follows: the Northeast decreased from 0.25% to 0.04%, East China decreased from 0.22% to 0.1%, South China decreased from 0.59%, Central China decreased from 0.2%, Southwest China decreased from 0.22%, and North China decreased from 0.17%, all to 0.14%, and the Northwest decreased from 0.25% to 0.18%. In terms of basic construction projects, most have been overfulfilled. For example, the long-distance telecommunications construction project, one of the key construction projects, completed 112% of its line construction and 195% of its machinery construction, enabling close wired communication between the capital and the centers of major administrative regions and most provincial capitals. The 12,000-kilometer wired telephone line between Beijing and Moscow also officially opened on December 12th of last year. In addition, China's postal and telecommunications relations with other countries have also been promoted. In 1951, postal and telecommunications work will strive to improve work quality and reduce costs based on the achievements of 1950.

    将继续努力提高工作质量减低成本
    【本报讯】一九五○年的全国邮电工作，在中央人民政府的正确领导下，经过全体邮电员工的努力，已作出了很多成绩。全国邮电机构，已在一九五○年内将长期分立的现象改变。组织领导，人事、器材、财务、业务等各方面已经全部统一，实现了“集中领导、专业分工、邮电合一”的原则，从而保证完成了全年生产计划和基本建设计划。在经费收入方面，邮政完成计划的百分之一○七·六，电信完成计划的百分之一○四。邮政信件寄递速率已大有改进。如从北京寄发各地信件平均日期，以十月份与一月份比，至福州提快了五天半，至广州提快了三天，至成都提快了五天，至宜昌提快了六天半，至柳州提快了二天半。在电信方面，普遍展开了消灭差错运动，已获有成效。各级报务差错的百分率下降的情况是：东北由百分之○·二五降为○·○四，华东由百分之○·二二降为○·一，华南由百分之○·五九、华中由百分之○·二、西南由百分之○·二二、华北由百分之○·一七，都降为百分之○·一四，西北由百分之○·二五降为○·一八。在基本建设工程方面，大都超额完成，如建设重点之一的长途电信建设工程，线路完成了百分之一一二，机械完成了百分之一九五，使首都与各大行政区中心及大部份省府所在地取得了密切的有线电的联系。北京与莫斯科长达一万二千公里的有线电话，亦已于去年十二月十二日正式通话。此外，我国和国际的邮电关系亦有所推进。一九五一年邮电工作，将在一九五○年成就的基础上，为提高工作质量，降低成本而努力。
