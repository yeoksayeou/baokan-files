　　Representatives from Various Localities at the Conference on Handling Foreign-Subsidized Universities
    Unanimously and Enthusiastically Endorse the Government Administration Council's Decision
    Resolutely Eliminate the Influence of American Cultural Aggression, Develop New Democratic Education
    [Reported by this newspaper] During the Conference on Handling Foreign-Subsidized Universities convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, school board members, presidents, and professors from more than ten foreign-subsidized universities in North China, East China, and Central South administrative regions gave written or oral interviews to this newspaper reporter. The statements of each individual are published below:

    Lu Zhiwei, President of Yenching University: I attended the Conference on Handling Foreign-Subsidized Universities convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central Government on behalf of Yenching University. After listening to the reports of the Minister and two Vice-Ministers, I understood why we must first handle the schools subsidized by Americans. American imperialism is the bully among imperialists. Petty favors cannot buy the souls of the Chinese people. As for the entire faculty and students of Yanjing University, we had long been wary of this kind of insidious calculation. We had already expressed our attitude of not wanting to eat foreign food anymore. Moreover, today the three ministers reminded us that the Chinese nation is a nation that has stood up. We look down on those small favors. The Government Administration Council's decision shows that the People's Government embraces the Chinese people who serve in missionary schools as their own family members. From now on, we should work even harder, be even more vigilant, and do everything for the people, which is to say, do everything for ourselves. My personal joy is indescribable. American imperialism let me take off a garment covered in lice, and I feel even more relaxed and free than the day I came out of the Japanese army prison.

    Li Fangxun, Acting President of Nanjing University of Nanking: Nanjing University of Nanking has suffered from the poison of American imperialist cultural aggression for more than sixty years. All faculty, staff, and students were elated and encouraged upon seeing the Government Administration Council's decision on handling American-subsidized cultural, educational, and relief organizations. Now, after listening to Minister Ma's and others' reports, I feel even more excited. The Chinese people have stood up, and they have stood up ideologically. The cultural concessions of imperialism in China have been taken back by us. For many years, we were prisoners of American imperialist cultural aggression, and now we are happily liberated and returned to the embrace of our motherland. The government provides thorough care for school funding and faculty, and we guarantee to complete the glorious task of eliminating the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression in the shortest possible time.

    Pan Shizi, Deputy Director of the School Board of Shanghai St. John's University: This conference is one of the most significant events in the history of Chinese education in nearly a century. American imperialist cultural aggression has harmed countless of our young people. This kind of cultural aggression is planned. Taking St. John's University as an example, before liberation, American imperialist teachers used various methods to persecute our young people. In 1948, when the passionate young people of St. John's University held a vigorous anti-American and pro-Japanese movement, the American church representative James Pott asked me to hand over the list of students who participated in the movement at that time. At that time, I was the Dean of Students, and I certainly did not agree. Later, James Pott openly said that two-thirds of St. John's University's funding relied on American subsidies. If the students continued to be anti-American, the funding would be cut off, and St. John's University would not be able to continue operating. American imperialism was the same before China's liberation as it is today. However, today's China is very different from the China before liberation. We have the People's Government to help us take back the school and run it ourselves, so that missionary universities can become Chinese universities and serve the Chinese people.

    Wu Yifang, President of Ginling College: Minister Ma's and others' reports made a deep impression on me. Missionary schools were used by American imperialism as bases for cultural aggression, and we ourselves should have consciously severed our ties with American imperialism long ago. Now that our People's Government has made a wise and decisive decision and provides thorough care for schools, teachers, and students, we are even more excited. We must resolutely implement the Government Administration Council's decision, thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression under the leadership of the government, transform the school into a school of the Chinese people, and cultivate young people who love the motherland and the people.

    Li Zong'en, President of Peking Union Medical College: The Government Administration Council's decision issued on December 29 last year has resolved the psychological contradictions we have had for several years. I am excited that the Ministry of Education convened the conference so quickly. The facilities of Peking Union Medical College are relatively complete, but the scale is not large, and it is difficult to take into account the quantity of talent training. Peking Union Medical College has the conditions to become a testing ground for medical education, and it can also establish some standards in terms of business. We hope that in the future, there should be a clear focus in the educational policy, either emphasizing education, or emphasizing business, or emphasizing training. I believe that under the leadership of the government, Peking Union Medical College can be run even better.

    Li Zhaohuan, President of Hangzhou Christian University: The Government Administration Council's "Decision on the Policy of Handling American-Subsidized Cultural, Educational, Relief Organizations and Religious Groups" is a correct and practical method. All doubts can be dispelled. The great Chinese people who have stood up will never be intimidated by the threats of American imperialism. We are determined to fight to the end to eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression in China. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must implement the cultural and educational policies of the Central People's Government and carry out our great political, defense, economic, and cultural construction.

    Bao Zeqing, Chairman of the Board of Shanghai University: Our schools and hospitals in the East China region related to Christianity issued a statement fully supporting the Government Administration Council's decision and expressing their willingness to assist in its implementation after seeing the Government Administration Council's decision. In the future, American imperialism can no longer use economic subsidies to achieve the purpose of cultural aggression. We believe that severing economic ties with the American church is the correct way to realize the Christian Reformation Declaration and the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Minister Ma's and others' reports pointed out the principles and methods for solving the problems and difficulties we have thought about. We fully agree. We are willing to work hard to continue running schools and refuse to accept American subsidies. We must carry forward the spirit of self-reliance to complete the great task and run the schools better, so that American imperialism can see that we, the Chinese people who have stood up!

    Yang Dezai, President of Cheeloo University in Shandong: Cheeloo University, which has a history of eighty-seven years, has deeply suffered from the poison of American imperialist cultural aggression. For more than eighty years, American imperialism has spread vicious ideas here, harming the souls of Chinese youth. In this movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, when the faculty, staff, and especially the young students of Cheeloo University recognized the ferocious face of American imperialism's aggression, their intense hatred for American imperialism was indescribable. At the same time, everyone also saw the loveliness of our great motherland, so the movement to eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression flourished. Everyone expects and demands that Cheeloo University return to the embrace of the motherland.

    Yang Chongguang, School Board Member of Lingnan University: Since Lingnan University held a conference to accuse American imperialist crimes on December 14 and 15 last year, all faculty, staff, and students have expressed great indignation at American imperialist cultural aggression over the past decades and are determined to remove American elements from the school, sever any connection with American imperialism, liberate Lingnan from the clutches of the devil, and make it a university of the people. However, due to financial and other difficulties, everyone had concerns and did not know how to solve them. Now, after listening to the reports of Ministers and Vice-Ministers Ma, Qian, and Zeng, we know that the government has very thorough and reasonable solutions to all the school's difficult problems. I represent the school board in expressing our firm support for the decisions of this conference. At the same time, I firmly believe that all our faculty, staff, and students will unite together in the future and, under the leadership of the People's Government, will definitely be able to run Lingnan University even better.

    Yang Yongqing, President of Soochow University: All faculty, staff, and students of Soochow University unanimously and enthusiastically support the Government Administration Council's decision on handling American-subsidized cultural and educational organizations. Coming to Beijing for this conference, I hope that a concrete plan can be made under the leadership of the government so that our school can become an educational undertaking completely run by Chinese people themselves. After listening to the reports of the ministers and vice-ministers of the Central Ministry of Education, I feel that their positions are strict and just, their instructions are clear, and their care is thorough. We will definitely do our best to run our school well and strive for the education of New Democracy.

    Zeng Xianling, Representative of the School of Aurora College for Women: The Government Administration Council's decision is unprecedented in Chinese history. American imperialism has founded many schools in our country to carry out cultural aggression and spread pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American ideas. We must unite all patriots and run our own education well. Li Jiaxi, a student of the college, said: American imperialism promotes the decadent "American way of life" in China, poisoning Chinese culture and the minds of Chinese youth. We have personally experienced it. We must completely sever our relationship with American imperialism, and we must help our harmed brothers and sisters to move forward together!

    Hu Wenyao, President of Aurora University: "We have made no contribution to the people, but the People's Government treats us so favorably. We are very grateful. In the future, we will serve the people with all our strength to repay the people. After listening to Minister Ma's report, all concerns have been eliminated. He told us that the People's Government is fully capable of solving all the difficult problems of foreign-subsidized universities." Mr. Wang Rensheng, a member of the school board, also expressed the same opinion.

    Huang Pu, Vice President of Huachung University: Our struggle with American imperialism today is comprehensive, not just limited to military affairs. American imperialism's cultural aggression against our country is even more vicious. American imperialism uses various missionary universities as bases for cultural aggression. Today, our colleagues in missionary universities are all awakened and have stood up. We must wage a sharp struggle with American imperialism and thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression on the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, we must run the school well and make it a university of the Chinese people.

    Wu Keming, President of Mingxian College in Shanxi, said: Mingxian was established by taking American money through the hands of the bureaucratic capitalist Kong Xiangxi. For more than forty years, it has been promoting the comprador ideology of being pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American, and the exploiting class ideology aimed at getting promoted and becoming rich. Here, kind people, whether administrative staff, faculty, or students, are all oppressed and excluded. The Central Ministry of Education convening this conference on handling foreign-subsidized universities makes me feel that the People's Government attaches great importance to and cherishes the people's education. I believe that our government has the strength and the means to make these foreign-subsidized universities run better.

　　各地处理接受外国津贴高等学校会议各地代表
    一致热烈拥护政务院决定
    坚决肃清美国文化侵略影响，发展新民主主义教育
    【本报讯】在中央人民政府教育部召开的处理接受外国津贴的高等学校会议期间，华北、华东、中南各大行政区十余个接受外国津贴的高等学校的校董、校长和教授，分别向本报记者发表书面或口头谈话。现将各人的谈话发表如下：
    燕京大学校长陆志韦：我代表燕京大学出席了中央教育部召开的处理接受外国津贴的高等学校会议。听了部长和两位副部长的报告，我明白了为什么我们要先处理美国人所津贴的学校。美帝国主义是帝国主义中间的恶霸。小恩小惠买不了中国人的灵魂。拿燕大全体师生来说，我们早就提防到这一步暗算。早已表明我们的态度不愿意再吃外国人的饭了，何况今天三位部长又提醒我们说，中华民族是已经站起来的民族。我们瞧不起那一点小恩小惠。政务院的决议，表明人民政府把在教会学校服务的中国人，抱在自己的怀里当亲人看待。从此，我们应当格外努力，格外警惕，一切为人民，也就是一切为自己。我个人的快乐是说不出来的，美帝让我把一件长满了虱子的衣裳脱下来了，比我从日本陆军监狱出来的那一天还觉得轻松自在。
    南京金陵大学代理校长李方训：金陵大学受了美帝六十余年的文化侵略的毒害。全体师生员工们看到政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文教救济机关的决定，一致欢呼鼓舞。现在听了马部长等的报告，心里更觉兴奋。中国人民站起来了，而且从思想上站起来了。帝国主义在中国的文化租界被我们收回来了。多少年来，我们做了美帝文化侵略的俘虏，而今欣得解放，回到祖国的怀抱里来了。政府对于学校经费以及教职员等方面照顾周到，我们保证在最短期间完成肃清美帝文化侵略影响的光荣任务。
    上海圣约翰大学校委会副主任委员潘世滋：这次会议，是近百年来，中国教育史上一件最重大的事。美国帝国主义的文化侵略，不知害了我们多少青年。这种文化侵略，是有计划的。就以圣约翰大学而论，在未解放前，美国帝国主义的教员，用各种方法，迫害我们的青年。在一九四八年时期，当圣约翰大学的热血青年，轰轰烈烈举行反美扶日运动的时候，美国教会代表卜其吉（James Pott），就要我交出当时参加运动的学生名单，那时候，我担任训导长职务，我当然不答应。后来卜其吉公开地说，圣约翰大学的经费，三分之二靠美国津贴，如果学生再要反美，经费就要断绝，圣约翰大学就要开不成了。美国帝国主义在中国解放前是与今日一样的。不过，今日的中国，与解放前的中国大不同了。我们有了人民政府，帮助我们把学校收回自办，使教会大学，成为中国的大学，并且是为中国人民服务的大学了。
    南京金陵女子文理学院院长吴贻芳：马部长等的报告给我以深刻的印象。教会学校被美帝国主义利用作为文化侵略的据点，我们自己早应自觉地割断跟美帝国主义的关系。现在我们人民政府有了英明果断的决策，又对学校对教师对学生照顾周到，更使我们兴奋。我们要坚决贯彻政务院的决定，在政府领导下彻底肃清美帝文化侵略影响，改造学校成为中国人民自己的学校，培养爱祖国爱人民的青年。
    协和医学院院长李宗恩：政务院去年十二月二十九日颁布的决定，解除了我们几年来心理上的矛盾。教育部这样快召开会议，我感到兴奋。协和建筑设备比较完善，但规模不大，在培养人才方面很难照顾到量的问题。协和有条件成为医学教育的试验场所，也可以在业务方面建立一些标准。我们希望今后在教育方针上应有明确重点，或着重教育，或着重业务，或着重训练。我相信在政府领导下，协和一定可以办得更好。
    之江大学校长黎照寰：政务院《关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体方针的决定》是正确、切实的办法。一切疑虑可以冰释。伟大的、已经站起来了的中国人民决不是美帝国主义的恫吓所能吓倒的，我们坚决为肃清美帝在中国的文化侵略的影响而奋斗到底。在毛主席领导下，我们要贯彻中央人民政府的文化教育政策，开展我国伟大的政治、国防、经济、和文化建设。
    上海沪江大学董事长鲍哲庆：我们华东区与基督教有关的学校医院，看到政务院的决定后，就声明全力拥护，并愿意协助执行。今后美帝不能再利用经济津贴来达到文化侵略的目的。我们相信与美国教会割断经济关系，是实现基督教革新宣言和三自运动的正确途径。马部长等的报告，给我们所想到的问题和困难指出了解决的原则和办法。我们完全赞成。我们愿意努力继续办学，拒绝接受美国津贴。我们要发扬自力更生的精神来完成伟大的任务，把学校办得更好，让美帝国主义看看，我们站起来了的中国人民！
    山东齐鲁大学校长杨德斋：有八十七年历史的齐鲁大学，深深地遭受了美帝文化侵略的毒害。八十多年来，美帝在这里传播着恶毒的思想，戕害着中国青年的灵魂。在这次抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动中，齐大的教职员工，特别是青年同学们，认识了美帝狰狞的侵略面貌时，那种对美帝的强烈的憎恨，是难以形容的。同时，大家也看到了伟大祖国的可爱，于是肃清美帝文化侵略影响的运动，便蓬勃展开。人人期望和要求齐大回到祖国的怀抱。
    岭南大学校董杨重光：岭南大学自从去年十二月十四、五日举行了控诉美帝罪行大会以后，全校师生员工对美帝数十年来的文化侵略表示了极大的愤慨，决心要把美帝分子从校内清除出去，斩断与美帝的任何联系，把岭南从魔掌中解放出来，使它成为人民的大学。但是因为经费等困难，大家都有顾虑，不知如何解决。现在听了马、钱、曾等正副部长的报告，知道了政府对学校的一切困难问题，都有极周到、合理的解决办法。我代表校董会对这次会议的决定，表示坚决拥护。同时坚信：我们全体师生员工，今后一致团结起来，在人民政府领导下，一定能把岭南大学办得更好。
    东吴大学校长杨永清：关于政务院处理接受美国津贴的文教机关的决定，东吴全校师生员工一致热烈拥护。此次来京开会，希望能在政府领导下制成具体方案，使我校成为完全由中国人自办的教育事业。听了中央教育部正副部长的报告，我觉得立场严正，指示明确，照顾周到。我们一定全心全意办好我们的学校，为新民主主义的教育努力。
    上海震旦女子文理学院校方代表曾宪玲：政务院的决定在中国历史上是空前的。美帝国主义在我国创办许多学校，借以进行文化侵略，传播亲美、崇美、恐美思想。我们要团结一切爱国人士，办好自己的教育。该院同学李家熙说：美帝在中国鼓吹堕落的“美国生活方式”，毒害中国文化和中国青年的思想，我们亲身体验到了。我们要完全割断与美帝的关系，我们要扶起受害的兄弟姊妹一同前进！
    震旦大学校长胡文耀：“我们对人民毫无贡献，而人民政府对我们这样的优待。我们万分感激。今后我们要以全副力量为人民服务，来报答人民。听了马部长的报告，一切的顾虑都消除了。他告诉我们人民政府完全有办法解决接受外国津贴的高等学校的一切困难问题。”该校校董王仁生先生也表示了同样的意见。
    武昌华中大学副校长黄溥：我们今天与美帝国主义的斗争是全面的，不只是限于军事。美帝对我国的文化侵略更是最毒辣的。美帝利用各教会大学，把它们作为文化侵略的据点。今天我们教会大学的同仁都觉悟了，都站起来了。我们要与美帝作尖锐的斗争，彻底肃清美帝对中国人民的文化侵略的影响。在中央人民政府教育部领导下，把学校办好，使它成为中国人民的大学。
    山西铭贤学院院长吴克明说：铭贤是通过官僚资本家孔祥熙之手拿美帝的钱来设立的，四十余年来它一直宣传亲美崇美恐美的买办思想和以升官发财为目的的剥削阶级思想。在这里，善良的人，不管是行政人员、教职员或学生，都受到压迫与排挤。中央教育部此次召开处理外国津贴的高等学校会议，使我感到人民政府对于人民教育是非常重视和爱护的。我相信，我们的政府有力量有办法使这些受外国津贴的高等学校办的更好。
