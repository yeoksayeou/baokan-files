　　To smash the economic blockade of American imperialism and complete the preparations for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests in a timely manner, various regions in the country are actively developing domestic pesticides. For example, "Wang Tong" (copper sulfate), used for seed disinfection, has gradually resumed production in the Northeast. Shanxi Province has also successfully trial-produced it and plans to conduct demonstration promotion in various places first. To help farmers in various regions control underground pests, Hunan Province's world-famous arsenic mine (red arsenic) has gradually resumed production. This year, it can produce more than 20,000 dan of red arsenic. After consultation between the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and Hunan Province, it is planned to distribute it to North China, East China, Northwest China, Henan and other provinces in a planned way before the spring plowing this year at a lower price. "Sodium fluorosilicate," successfully trial-produced in Zhejiang Province last year, is an effective pesticide for controlling underground pests. It is planned to produce a portion for demonstration promotion in various places first.

　　Preventing and controlling cotton pests such as cotton aphids and spider mites is an important issue to ensure increased cotton production. Last year, Henan, Hebei and other places promoted a large number of indigenous pesticides such as "cotton oil soap," "lime-sulfur mixture," and "tobacco water," which played a significant role in pest control. To solve the urgent needs of the masses in cotton-growing areas, the North China Agricultural Disease and Insecticide Factory, directly led by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, has initially planned to produce 100,000 jin of "cotton oil soap" throughout the year. The factory, as well as Hebei Province and other places, are currently producing it in large quantities to supply it to various places in a timely manner.

　　In addition, the North China Agricultural Disease and Insecticide Factory also plans to trial-produce "mercury preparations" and "wettable sulfur powder" this year for seed disinfection and red spider mite control in various places. The Agricultural Chemistry Department of Beijing Agricultural University is trial-producing "Ceresan," and the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute is trial-producing pesticides such as "666," all of which have great development prospects.

　　粉碎美帝经济封锁
    各地努力发展国产农药
    【本报讯】为了粉碎美帝国主义的经济封锁，及时完成防治病虫害的准备工作，国内各地对于发展国产病虫农药，正在积极进行。如种籽消毒用之“王铜”，东北已逐渐恢复生产，山西省也试制成功，计划先在各地进行示范推广。为了帮助各地农民防治地下虫害，湖南省世界著名的砒矿（红砒）已逐步恢复生产，今年可生产红砒二万余担，经中央人民政府农业部与湖南省协议结果，准备在今年春耕以前，以较低价格，分向华北、华东、西北、河南等省有计划地推广。浙江省去年试制成功的“氟矽酸钠”，是防治地下虫害的有效药剂，准备制出一部分，先在各地作示范推广。
    防治棉花虫害如棉蚜、红蜘蛛等，是保证棉花增产的一个重要问题。去年河南、河北等地，推广了大量“棉油皂”、“石灰硫磺剂”、“烟草水”等土产农药，发挥了很大的治虫作用。为了解决棉区群众的迫切需要，中央人民政府农业部直接领导的华北农业病虫药制造厂，已初步计划全年生产“棉油皂”十万斤，该厂以及河北省等地目前都正在大量制造，以便及时供应各地使用。
    此外，华北农业病虫药制造厂，并计划在本年度试制“水银制剂”、“可湿性硫磺粉”，以供给各地进行种籽消毒及防治红蜘蛛之用。北京农业大学农化系正试制“赛力散”，华北农业科学研究所正试制“六六六”等农药，也都有很大的发展前途。
