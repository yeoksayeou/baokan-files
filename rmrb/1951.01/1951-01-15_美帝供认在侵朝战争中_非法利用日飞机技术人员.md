　　U.S. Admits to Illegally Using Japanese Aircraft Technicians in the War of Aggression Against Korea

Xinhua News Agency, 13th. U.S. Brigadier General Duir, Commander of the Far East Air Force Materiel Department of the United States, admitted that the United States illegally used a large number of Japanese aircraft technicians to assist the United States in its war of aggression against Korea. According to a Tokyo 11th dispatch from the Associated Press, Duir claimed that "two-thirds" of the "heavy maintenance and inspection work on combat aircraft and transport aircraft" of the U.S. military invading Korea was done by so-called "Japanese non-military personnel." These jobs were carried out in the large and small repair shops of the U.S. Far East Air Force Materiel Department, with a total of about 15,000 workers. Duir admitted: "Two-thirds of the workers are Japanese, many of whom were veteran workers in the aircraft industry before Japan surrendered." He also revealed that as early as eight months ago, the U.S. military had illegally used Japanese people to prepare for war for the U.S. Far East Air Force. Duir emphasized, "Without these (Japanese) people, we would not be able to do anything."

　　美帝供认在侵朝战争中
    非法利用日飞机技术人员
    【新华社十三日讯】美国远东空军器材部司令官杜亿尔准将，承认美国非法利用大批日本飞机技术人员协助美国进行侵朝战争。据美联社东京十一日电透露，杜亿尔声称：侵朝美军的“作战飞机及运输飞机繁重的保养与检查工作”，有“三分之二”都是所谓“日本非军职人员”做的。这些工作都在美国远东空军器材部的大小修理厂中进行，工作人员共约有一万五千人。杜亿尔承认：“三分之二的工人是日本人，其中有许多人都是日本投降前在飞机工业中的老工人”。他并透露，早在八个月以前，美军即已非法利用日人为美国远东空军进行备战工作。杜亿尔着重指出“没有这些（日本）人，我们是无法做事的。”
