The Efforts Private Financial Institutions Should Make After the US Economic Blockade Against Us
Secretary-General of the Chinese Financial Society Zeng Ling

After suffering a disastrous defeat in the Korean war of aggression, American imperialism, in its desperation, announced a ban on trade with us and froze our funds in the United States, further exposing the fact that the US is an enemy of the Chinese people. Our domestic and foreign trade situation has also begun to undergo some changes as a result. This will inevitably have a certain impact on private financial institutions. Employees in the financial industry must clearly recognize the root of this change and take necessary measures to overcome the difficulties.

Since the currency stabilization last year, China's private financial industry has begun to acquire conditions for normal development. Due to currency stability and reduced speculation, private financial institutions have begun to break away from their past close ties to speculative operations and reliance on high-interest rate spreads for survival. They are now engaging in new operations by streamlining, saving, improving management, expanding legitimate connections with industry and commerce, and lowering interest rates, exchange rates, insurance rates, and handling fees. Last August, the National Financial Industry Joint Conference and the Overseas Chinese Dependents Welfare Conference convened by the People's Bank of China further clarified the direction of the financial industry serving industry, commerce, and the people. Private banks and money shops also unanimously agreed to work under the leadership of the state bank to invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, both domestically and internationally. Designated banks are using their overseas institutions and funds to serve import and export trade and to develop overseas remittances. Thanks to the vigorous efforts of the People's Government to promote domestic and foreign trade last year, international trade has become increasingly active, and the scale of foreign exchange business has expanded as never before. It has also fundamentally changed the past situation in which foreign banks monopolized foreign exchange, increasing the commission income of Chinese-operated banks. The overseas Chinese remittance industry has also benefited from the correct remittance policies adopted by the People's Government, which have changed the old China's exploitation of overseas remittances and oppression of the remittance industry. Last year, overseas Chinese remittances reached their highest peak since the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the remittance industry also obtained normal profits. Under the support of the People's Insurance Company of China, the Chinese insurance industry began to break the monopoly and manipulation of foreign companies, increasing insurance premium income. Due to the improvement of the economic situation in the second half of last year, the business of private small and medium-sized banks and money shops combined with the grain, cotton, native products, and general merchandise merchants, as well as banks combined with industry and trade in large cities, has generally developed. After the autumn harvest last year, private banks and money shops' deposits doubled compared to July; loans and remittances also increased accordingly. At this time, most banks and money shops have been able to break even, and some have already had surpluses, and a few banks have begun to make up for deficits.

American imperialism's economic blockade and plunder against us will certainly not prevent us from moving forward, but will accelerate the process of our country moving towards economic independence and autonomy. China's industrial and agricultural production and domestic trade will all develop more systematically in 1951. In terms of foreign trade, trade with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries will be developed more systematically, and trade with capitalist countries will be actively adjusted.

Under this situation, China's private financial industry will certainly also accelerate its own transition to independence and autonomy. However, since private financial institutions have long been accustomed to obtaining profits from trade with imperialist countries and have blindly accumulated foreign exchange in the United States, the US blockade policy and shameless plundering will inevitably have a considerable impact on them. First, as a result of the relative reduction in trade with capitalist countries, the trade in some regions and some materials will be relatively reduced, thus causing a reduction in import and export trade in some regions (such as northern ports) and a reduction in foreign trade in some materials (such as egg products and oils). The foreign exchange business of designated banks in certain ports will be reduced, and at the same time, the deposit, loan, and remittance business of importers and exporters who have dealings with private banks and money shops will also be reduced. The insurance business of private insurance companies in domestic and foreign trade will also be reduced. Second, the freezing of our funds in the United States by the US has further created difficulties in the capital turnover of some financial institutions. Some designated banks that operate foreign exchange will suffer a major blow after their funds in the United States are frozen. Among them, a small number of banks that usually blindly worship the US dollar and deposit large amounts of money in the United States, and have always been unwilling to transfer it back to the country, will suffer greater losses this time. This directly increases the difficulty in business operations. At the same time, the stagnation of funds of importers and exporters will also affect the recovery of loans from banks and money shops to some extent, making their cash position more tight at the end of this year. The overseas Chinese remittance industry is currently unable to conduct remittances in the dollar area and must organize transit remittances or material transportation and re-export to offset overseas remittances. In this way, the business of collecting remittances will increase certain difficulties. According to the current situation, these difficulties encountered by some private financial institutions during the Lunar New Year this year will be exposed. Some banks and money shops that have already turned from loss to profit have begun to return to losses in December, and the number of their old and new deficits will be even larger, which will seriously affect the year-end settlement. A small number of banks and money shops with poor management, abnormal labor-management relations, and large deficits are bound to face greater dangers.

Due to the US aggression, China's private financial industry is once again facing a serious test. The currency stabilization in March last year allowed the financial industry to break away from the inextricable ties with speculation for the past thirteen years. The result of the US freezing funds will prompt the financial industry to break away from the relationship of being controlled, entrapped, and utilized by imperialism for half a century, completely break away from the historical tradition of relying on serving trade with imperialism to earn profits, and break away from the historical tradition of taking foreign exchange accumulation as an important business operation method of banks. China's private financial industry must not hesitate to quickly break away from its dependence on imperialism and work harder to build an independent and autonomous new democratic economy, change the direction of financial work, and take invigorating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas as its main task, face the inland, face the countryside, and develop independent and autonomous production and trade. At the same time, accelerate streamlining and savings, self-transformation, and break away from the expenditure scale and living standards maintained by relying on speculation and comprador profits for half a century. Employees' salaries should be in line with those of state banks. A small number of banks that had a large amount of foreign exchange in the past, abnormal labor-management relations, and failed to streamline and save quickly, this special condition will no longer exist in the future. All employees in the private financial industry must combine with the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, recognize the despicable and shameless conspiracy of American imperialism to plunder the wealth of the Chinese people, and thus hate, despise, and scorn American imperialism, and improve the political awareness of employees. In this movement, financial industry employees must put down their burdens, no longer avoid treatment, no longer maintain a false appearance of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside, no longer be attached to a special life, and jointly recognize the actual situation of the current difficulties, and then agree to overcome the difficulties by relying on their own efforts. Do not have any thoughts of dependence. In fact, those who cannot be transformed should find ways to do so as soon as possible, so as to benefit the three parties of capital, labor, and depositors. As long as all employees can recognize the difficulties and jointly seek solutions to the difficulties, it is believed that many banks, insurance companies, and remittance companies will be able to overcome the difficulties, train themselves to become members of the independent and autonomous new democratic financial system, undertake certain tasks in the new democratic economic construction, and jointly serve the people.

　　美帝对我经济封锁后  私营金融业应有的努力
    中国金融学会秘书长  曾凌
    美帝国主义于朝鲜侵略战争惨败以后，穷凶极恶的宣布禁止对我贸易，封冻我国在美资金，进一步暴露了美帝是中国人民的敌人。我国内外贸易情况也因此开始发生了若干变化。这，对于私营金融业必将发生一定的影响。金融业从业人员必须明确认识这一变化的根源，采取必要克服困难的办法。
    中国私营金融业自去年通货稳定以来，已开始获得正常发展的条件。由于通货稳定，投机缩小，私营金融业已开始摆脱过去对投机经营保持密切联系，依赖高利差维持生存的状态，而从精简节约，改善经营，扩大与工商业的正当联系，降低利率、汇率、保险费率、手续费率等方法，从事新的经营。去年八月中国人民银行召集的全国金融业联席会议和华侨眷属福利会议，更明确了金融业服务工商业，服务人民的方向。私营银钱业也一致同意在国家银行的领导下，为活泼城乡内外物资交流而努力。指定银行则以其国外机构及资金，服务于进出口贸易，开展侨汇业务。由于去年人民政府大力开展国内外物资交流工作，国际贸易日趋活跃，外汇业务的规模也空前扩大，而且根本改变了过去外商银行垄断外汇的局面，增加了中国人经营的银行的手续费收入。侨批业也由于人民政府采取了正确的侨汇政策，改变了旧中国剥削侨汇、压迫侨批业的情况，去年华侨汇款已达抗战以来的最高峰，侨批业也获得了正常的收益。华商保险业在中国人民保险公司的支持下，开始打破了外商的垄断操纵，增加了保险费的收入。由于去年下半年经济情况的好转，凡与粮、棉、土产、百货等商帮相结合的私营中小行庄，以及与大城市中的工业贸易相结合的银行，其营业均普遍发展。去年秋收以后，私人行庄存款较之七月增加一倍；放款、汇兑均有相应的增加。这时，大部行庄均已经能够保本自给，有的已有盈余，少数银行开始弥补赤字。
    美帝国主义对我的经济封锁和掠夺，当然不能阻止我们前进，且将更加速我国在经济上走向独立自主的过程。中国的工业、农业生产和国内贸易，在一九五一年均将更有计划的向前发展。在国外贸易方面，将更加有计划地发展对苏联及新民主主义国家的贸易，并主动地调节对资本主义国家的贸易。
    在这种形势下，中国私营金融业当然也将加速自己转向独立自主的过程。但是，由于私营金融业长期习惯于从对帝国主义国家贸易中获得利润，且有盲目地积存外汇于美国者。美帝的封锁政策，和无耻的掠夺行为，对他们不能不有相当影响。第一，由于对资本主义国家贸易相对缩小的结果，部分地区及部分物资的贸易相对减退，因此引起部分地区（如北方口岸）进出口贸易业务的减退，部分物资（如蛋品、油脂等）国外贸易的减退。某些口岸的指定银行的外汇业务将要减少，同时与私营行庄来往的进出口商的存、放、汇业务亦将减少。私营保险公司国内外贸易的保险业务亦将减少。第二，由于美帝封冻我国在美资金，更造成了某些金融业资金周转的困难。某些经营外汇的指定银行，其在美国的资金被冻结之后，将是一大打击。其中少数银行平日盲目崇拜美金并在美国大量存款，始终不愿调回国用的，这次所受损失亦较为重大。这就直接增加了营业运转上的困难。同时，进出口商的资金呆滞之后，亦将多少影响行庄的放款的收回，使他们在今年年关时节的银根可能较为紧迫。侨批业在美元地区现已无法进行汇兑，而必须组织转汇，或物资运输、转口以抵解侨汇。这样，收汇业务将增加一定的困难。根据目前情况估计，今年农历新年某些私营金融业所遭遇的这些困难，均将暴露出来。一部分已经转亏为盈的行庄，在十二月份已开始重趋亏蚀，他们的新旧赤字数目将更为庞大，将严重地影响年终结算。少数经营不善、劳资关系不正常、赤字很大的行庄，势必发生更大的危险。
    由于美国的侵略行动，中国私营金融业已经再度面临严重的考验。去年三月通货稳定，使金融业摆脱了十三年来与投机所结不解之缘。美帝封冻资金的结果，则将促使金融业摆脱半世纪来的被帝国主义羁糜笼络利用的关系，彻底摆脱依赖与帝国主义贸易服务来赚取利润的历史传统，摆脱过去的以积存外汇为银行重要业务经营方式的历史传统。中国私营金融业必须毫不迟疑地迅速摆脱对帝国主义的依赖，而更加努力地建设独立自主的新民主主义经济，改变金融工作的方向，而以活泼城乡物资交流为主要工作，面向内地，面向农村，发展独立自主的生产贸易。同时加速精简节约，自我改造，摆脱半世纪来的依赖投机与买办利润维持的开支规模与生活水准，职工薪金应向国家银行看齐。少数银行过去由于确有大量外汇，劳资关系不正常，未能迅速精简节约，今后这一特殊条件已不再存在。私营金融业全体从业人员必须结合抗美援朝保家卫国运动，认识美帝国主义掠夺中国人民财富的卑鄙无耻阴谋，从而仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝，提高从业人员的政治觉悟。在这一运动中，金融业从业人员，必须放下包袱，不再讳病忌医，不再保持外强中干的虚伪局面，不再留恋特殊生活，共同认识目前困难的实际情况，然后协议自力克服困难。不要存有任何依赖的思想。其实在无法改造者应即及早设法，以期对于资劳存三方有利。只要全体从业人员能够认识困难，并共同寻求解决困难的办法，相信将有不少行庄、保险业、侨批业有可能克服困难，锻炼成为独立自主的新民主主义金融体系的成员，在新民主主义经济建设中，负担一定的任务，共同为人民服务。
