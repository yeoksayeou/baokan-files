Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: Discontent is growing within the Japanese "Police Reserve Force," established under the direction of the American occupation authorities and intended for use as an invasion force. According to a United Press report, since the frequent relocation of "Police Reserve Force" bases began at the end of last year, members have become increasingly panicked, fearing deployment to Korea for combat, with some even deserting. According to Hirota Mitsuo (transliteration), a member originally from Ohashi-cho, Takasaki City, "the number of deserters has recently increased sharply" from the "Reserve Force" stationed in Hokkaido. He said, "Life in the unit is completely military-style, and foreign-style (referring to American style). The weapons and equipment are also foreign-style. Even daily necessities are foreign-made." "Training is conducted under the direct guidance of American officers," and is very intense, with even illness being "no excuse for rest." The entire "Reserve Force" unit stationed near Sapporo, Hokkaido, staged a "slowdown" on November 1st last year, due to dissatisfaction with pay, treatment, and deprivation of freedom. In mid-December of last year, Honda Kikuo and Yamada Saburo, members of the "Reserve Force" stationed in Aomori Prefecture, were arrested. According to Captain Cadwell of the U.S. military's "Counterintelligence Corps" in Aomori Prefecture, they were arrested because "they made threatening remarks about MacArthur while drinking."

In this situation, MacArthur is strengthening strict control over "Reserve Force" members. The movements of "Reserve Force" members are strictly limited. For example, the authorities of the "Reserve Force" stationed at the former Kyushu Aircraft Factory in Fukuoka Prefecture issued an order to members stating: "Approximately ten tea houses and restaurants where designated Communist Party members, their sympathizers, and people from third countries (Koreans) frequent are prohibited. Violators will be severely punished." Takayama Koji (transliteration), a member originally from Shibane Village, Sawa District, Gunma Prefecture, was dismissed because his friends included Communist Party members.

　　日“警察后备队”弥漫不满情绪
    队员害怕被送到朝鲜纷纷逃亡
    【新华社十一日讯】在美国占领当局指令下建立而准备作为侵略军使用的日本“警察后备队”，正滋长着不满情绪。据联合通讯社消息：自去年年底“警察后备队”驻地移调频繁以来，队员大起恐慌，害怕被送到朝鲜作战，甚至有人逃亡。据原籍高崎市大桥町的队员广田光夫（译音）透露：驻在北海道的“后备队”，“最近逃亡的人骤见增加”。他说：“队里的生活完全是军队式的，并且是外国式（按指美国式）的。武器装备也是外国式的。甚至连日用品都发给外国货”。“训练是在美国军官直接指导下进行的”，十分紧张，甚至生病都“不准休息”。北海道札幌近郊的“后备队”全体队员因对饷金、待遇及被剥夺自由感到不满，曾在去年十一月一日实行“怠工”。去年十二月中旬，驻青森县的“后备队”队员本田喜久雄与山田三郎两人被捕。据驻青森县美军“防谍部”上尉加得威尔说：他们是因为“在饮酒时曾发表对麦克阿瑟的威胁性的言辞”。
    在此情势下，麦克阿瑟正在对“后备队”队员加强严格管制。“后备队”队员的行动受到严格的限制。例如驻在福冈县前九州飞机工厂的“后备队”当局，对队员发出一项命令说：“经指定有共产党员及其同道人以及第三国人（朝鲜人）出入的茶馆与饭店约十家，禁止进入。违者严罚”。原籍群马县佐波郡芝根村的队员高山弘二（译音），因他的朋友中有共产党员而被开革。
