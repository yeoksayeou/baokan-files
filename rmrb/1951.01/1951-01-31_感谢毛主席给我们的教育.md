　　Grateful for Chairman Mao's Education

　　Respected Chairman Mao:
　　We are immensely grateful to you. In the new China under your leadership, education has opened its doors to workers and peasants. Therefore, we fifteen farmers have been able to come to the Agricultural University to study. In these past six months of study, we have learned many scientific principles. We have learned various techniques, and many knots in our thinking have been untied. In the past, we thought that poor harvests were the will of heaven, and there was nothing people could do. Now we understand that we can gradually overcome natural disasters by using our hands and brains.
　　Respected Chairman Mao, we fifteen people are labor models selected by everyone. We must forever maintain the glory you have brought us. This year, Comrade Xu Moshan harvested 600 jin of cotton per mu; Comrade Li Fucheng harvested four shi of millet per mu, reaching an unprecedented national record. After more than six months of study, we will return to our hometowns and follow your instructions, striving to create even newer production records.

　　感谢毛主席给我们的教育敬爱的毛主席：
    我们万分感激您。在您领导下的新中国，教育向工农开了大门。因此，我们这十五个农民能来到农业大学学习。在这半年多的学习中，我们知道了许多科学上的道理。我们学习了各种技术，思想上的许多疙疸解开了。从前我们以为庄稼不收是天年，人没有办法。现在我们懂得用手用脑子就可以一步一步的战胜天灾。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们十五个人是被大家选出来的劳动模范，我们一定要永远保持您带给我们的光荣。今年许墨山同学种的棉花，每亩摘了六百斤；李福成同学种的小米，每亩收了四石，达到了全国空前纪录。我们经过半年多的学习。回到家乡以后，一定遵照您的指示，努力创造更新的生产纪录。
