　　Kailuan Coal Mine Neglects Safety Work
　　The privately-owned Kailuan Coal Mine has poor engineering equipment, no established production management system, unclear responsibilities, and ambiguous rewards and punishments. In addition, management personnel do not pay enough attention to safety work, and the mine's rescue equipment is also poor. As a result, eighteen fatal accidents occurred last year alone, and in the first half of last year alone, 680 workers were injured. The responsible parties at the mine must immediately pay attention to improving this phenomenon of neglecting safety work.
　　Guangzhou Customs Exceeds Tax Revenue Plan
　　Guangzhou Customs' tariff revenue for 1950 exceeded the original plan by 61 percent. Over the past year, it has also achieved considerable success in cargo supervision, valuation and taxation, simplifying procedures, investigating smuggling, and training cadres. In particular, it has been able to achieve strict supervision of import and export goods, sweeping away the past chaotic export situation.
　　Suzhou Business Community Enthusiastic About Paying Taxes
　　Various industries in Suzhou, Southern Jiangsu Province, are enthusiastically paying taxes. For example, the sauce industry made a large payment certificate, nine colored signs, and two red flags, and more than sixty managers personally went to pay. As of December 27 last year, the city's tax revenue had exceeded the 1950 target by 1.2 billion, and 3.1 billion in back taxes had been recovered.
　　Xinjiang Livestock Tax Fully Completed
　　Since the levy of livestock tax began in various parts of Xinjiang Province in mid-May last year, the adoption of self-reporting and investigation, and tax calculation according to rates, has been enthusiastically supported and actively paid by herders in various places. As of the end of November last year, the entire province's livestock tax has been fully paid, totaling 247,175 sheep.
　　Guangxi Exchanges Salt for Local Products
　　Guangxi Province's native produce and salt professional companies carry out chain business; the salt company exchanges 10,000 dan of edible salt with the native produce company for local products such as gallnuts, wheat bran, sulfur ore, green hemp, rosin, and tobacco leaves. In this way, on the one hand, the demand for edible salt is met, and on the other hand, the difficulty of unsalable local products for some farmers is solved.
　　Baoji-Tianshui Railway First Engineering Office Completes Thirty-Three Projects in Half a Year
　　Since the First Engineering Office of the Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau undertook the reconstruction project of 51 kilometers to 84 kilometers of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway in June 1950, it has completed thirty-three major projects by the end of December, including three tunnels, four embankments, and twenty-six bridges and culverts, using a total of 403,800 man-days. During the reconstruction, engineers, technicians, and all workers demonstrated a great revolutionary spirit of heroism, overcame all difficulties, and built this section of the people's railway.
　　Beijing Starts Levying License Plate Tax for the First Half of the Year
　　The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau will start levying the license plate tax for various vehicles for the first half of 1951 from the 16th. In order to avoid the past congestion, it has been decided to implement district-based collection and batch payment methods: the first batch, from January 16 to 31, is the tax payment date for vehicles such as bicycles, automobiles, motorcycles, horse-drawn carriages, manure carts, pushcarts, and rickshaws; the second batch, from January 22 to February 5, is the tax payment date for vehicles such as tricycles, animal-drawn carts, animal-drawn carts, and handcarts. The district-based collection method is that taxpayers pay taxes to the district tax sub-bureaus or temporary collection points according to the area where they live. The vehicles of staff members of institutions, organizations, schools, and factories can still be collectively paid to the tax sub-bureau in the area where they are located.
