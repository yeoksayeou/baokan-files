　　The Vatican: Tool of Imperialism
　　Zhang Qihua
　　In the film "The Fall of Berlin," we see that when Hitler madly shouted that he would conquer Moscow on the anniversary of the October Revolution, among those who praised him in that hall were the envoys of the Axis puppet states, as well as the representative of the Vatican. Hitler even jokingly suggested to this "angel" that he should take off his cassock and put on a Nazi uniform instead.

　　In another film, "Secret Envoy," we also see that as fascist Germany was about to collapse, Schellenberg, the head of German intelligence, arranged for a large number of agents and spies to be deployed to the Balkans for the United States. In Budapest, Sofia, Belgrade... he established relations with the representatives of the American envoys and the American embassy, instructing them to "infiltrate the ministries and departments of the people's democratic countries, the troops, and the government of the Fatherland Front, infiltrate the leadership organs of the Communist Party," and to "organize terrorist activities, eliminate the leaders of communism, and kill communists." Among these local heads of secret agents who accepted the tasks, there were archbishops wearing crosses.

　　What is described in these two films is not fiction or exaggeration. It is an accurate record of the collusion between the Vatican and imperialism in carrying out anti-people conspiracies and crimes.

　　The relationship between the Vatican and imperialism has a long history. The Vatican's collusion with fascism during and before World War II has long been known. When Mussolini seized power in Italy, Pope Pius XI declared, "This is the man God has given us!" Franco was always praised by the Vatican as a "loyal son of the Catholic Church." On July 20, 1933, Cardinal Pacelli (the current Pope Pius XII) signed a treaty with Hitler's main cadre, Papen, stipulating that all German bishops must pledge allegiance to Hitler's Third Reich. In fact, the Catholic Church in Germany, under the direct instructions of the Vatican, sponsored Hitler's rise to power.

　　When Mussolini invaded Abyssinia, the Pope said it was a "civilizing mission based on lofty charity." Germany's rearmament, Salazar's seizure of power in Portugal, Franco's in Spain, Germany's annexation of Austria, the Munich Conference, the Anglo-French betrayal of Czechoslovakia, the cession of Slovakia, Mussolini's invasion of Albania, Hitler's attack on Poland, Hitler's attack on France, and finally, Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union – all of these were approved and supported by the Vatican.

　　The Vatican's "heavenly kingdom" foreign policy is very clear. In the January 1944 issue of the American Foreign Policy Association's "Foreign Policy Reports," Hayden published an article entitled "The Vatican's Foreign Policy." In his article, Hayden had to admit that "the Vatican has shown a pro-fascist government tendency in the past twenty years." He explained that the Vatican's policy was due to "stubbornly clinging to a hope that they believed fascist countries could resist communism and defend 'civilization'." Hayden also described the Vatican's support for "Mussolini's expansion policy," the bellicosity of Milan's Cardinal Schuster, Pius XII's two congratulatory telegrams to Franco when he defeated the Republican army, and the fact that "Italian and Spanish fascists obtained the cooperation of the church," and other facts.

　　Regarding the Vatican's policy, the words of a Brazilian bishop, Duarte, can be cited. He wrote in November 1946: "Unfortunately, the Pope has always stubbornly adhered to Nazi and fascist methods. He participated in the fascist ranks and paved the way for World War II. Now the Vatican and imperialism are advancing side by side, and it itself is one of the most terrifying of imperialism."

　　Thus, it is not difficult for us to understand that after the outbreak of World War II, the "benevolent and merciful" Vatican never protested the brutal bombing of Warsaw, London, and Amsterdam, the tragic killing of peaceful citizens, and Hitler's sadistic massacre of millions of people. On July 24, 1941, when the French cardinals and archbishops convened a meeting to pass a treasonous declaration, the Vatican pretended not to know and made no statement. The declaration stated: "We respect the head of state (i.e., Pétain), we ask all French people to gather around him... we call on all Catholics to assist him in his work of revival. We hope to obtain the cooperation of the church to complete this common mission together." The Vatican not only did not refute such blatant treasonous clamoring from its subordinates, but instead gave it active support, precisely because the Vatican and the fascists were fundamentally birds of a feather. At the same time, they also regarded Pétain as a "loyal son of the Catholic Church."

　　In fact, not long after the outbreak of World War II, through the mediation of Alfieri, the Pope signed a secret agreement with Mussolini. The French "Paris Midi" newspaper commented on this secret, the content of which has not yet been made public, saying: "The agreement between the two Romes lies in jointly resisting communism." Throughout the war, Germans and Italians flocked to the Pope's side. From Gibraltar to Tokyo, Vatican representatives traveled everywhere. In order to better communicate with Eastern fascists, Pius XII acknowledged that the Shintoism practiced by Japanese Emperor and war criminal Hirohito was consistent with Christian doctrine and stationed a papal envoy in Tokyo.

　　However, the war did not develop according to the Vatican's "divine will," but ended by obeying the people's wishes and will. Fascism fell, imperialism weakened, and the people triumphed and became stronger.

　　The Vatican actively engaged in the following things after the war.

　　First, it intensified its efforts to rescue important fascist bandits. The Vatican, Catholic churches, and monasteries became havens for notorious fascists. Former Hitler representative Weizsäcker and former Vichy government representative to the Holy See, Béade, were allowed by Pius XII to live within the Vatican area. The representatives of the fascist "Slovak government," Sidor, and the "government's" foreign minister, Ďurčanský, were also at large there.

　　In November 1945, the Pope called for the pardon of 200 war criminals. In his 1945 Christmas message, Pius XII threatened: "Those who demand that the price of sins be paid and punish the criminals must be careful not to commit the sins and faults of others." A year later, this Pope declared in a speech at the College of Cardinals in February 1946: "Abroad, there is a misconception that people who join a certain group (in other words, Nazi party members, SS members, Gestapo) must be criminals. This is a shameless infringement of God's power, because only he can decide the fate of the guilty and the innocent, the fate of the guilty and the innocent." Obviously, no further explanation is needed, anyone can see who Pius XII is protecting, and who his words are directed against.

　　The Vatican's rescue and protection of fascist bandits continued until their corpses. Zocca, the abbot of a monastery in Milan, spent 200,000 lire (Italian currency) to organize a corpse theft. They stole the corpse of the fascist demon Mussolini, their "God-given man," who was hanged by the people, and hid it in the monastery, showing the Vatican's infinite loyalty to the fascist "doctrine."

　　The second major event that the Vatican actively engaged in after the war was to organize reactionary Catholic parties in various countries, attack people's parties, divide progressive forces, oppose people's democratic regimes, deploy secret agents and thugs, and carry out conspiracy, sabotage, and subversive rebellion.

　　After the war, a Catholic party called the "People's Democratic Party" appeared in Hungary. It fiercely opposed land reform and undermined various democratic measures of the government. In February 1948, Hungary uncovered the treasonous case of conspiracy, rebellion, and riots led by Cardinal Mindszenty. The documents and Mindszenty's confessions searched from the bishop's palace fully confirmed that behind this group of traitors of the motherland, there were supporters.

　　In Czechoslovakia, an underground organization that was uncovered in March 1946 maintained close ties with the Vatican. This was an organization equivalent to the German "Werewolf" group. The host, Koravík, was a Catholic priest and a pawn of foreign intelligence agencies.

　　In Poland, Cardinal Hlond, under the instructions of the Vatican, openly and secretly opposed the democratic regime. In the elections, he called on Catholics to vote against the democratic groups. President Bierut said when he met with journalists on November 22, 1946: "Until now, some Polish Catholics and reactionaries have stood together against the reform programs carried out by the democratic government."

　　In Italy, the dark forces of the clergy and the Vatican cooperated more directly, actively participating on the side of the reactionaries. Archbishop of Milan and member of the Pope's cabinet, Schuster, ordered: "Absolution is not to be given to communists and their sympathizers who wear the mask of the People's Democratic Front, supporters of materialism, and those who cast votes for unacceptable candidates or generally do not vote." Voting for the People's Democratic Front was declared an "inexcusable sin."

　　In France, the Catholic party led by Bidault - the Popular Republican Movement - was established with the help of the Vatican. It actively attacked and divided the left-wing parties. The French magazine "Horizon" (November 1946 issue) wrote: The Popular Republican Movement has backstage leaders - many bishops who supported the Vichy government, who directly obey Rome (i.e., the Vatican).

　　In Germany, the Vatican tried desperately to revive the Center Party. At the same time, it is also active in the Christian Social Union. This is an organization that inherits the Catholic Bavarian People's Party. War criminal Papen escaped the gallows, but he has once again led the Catholics in Germany.

　　In Austria, the Vatican carries out its work through Catholic groups, which call themselves the "People's" Party. In addition, the Catholic Action Association, headed by Senior Priest Fritter, has also been revived, expanding its scope of activities, and Fritter was appointed by Cardinal Innitzer, the Sudeten German. The "People's" Party's newspaper "Volksblatt" and the weekly "Furche" are very flattering to the Vatican, advocating the organization of a Catholic national alliance, striving to make Austria lean towards the West, and attacking the Soviet Union.

　　In China, the Pope appreciated the secret agent boss Yu Bin. In the cases of the "Catholic National Salvation Corps" in Xianxian and Zhengding, we more clearly see the claws of imperialism and the Vatican extending into China.

　　Finally, the most important step for the Vatican is to "strengthen unity" with American imperialism. In fact, the wonderful marriage between the largest "strong country" in heaven - the Vatican - and the largest "strong country" on earth - the United States - has long been concluded. The matchmaker and the parties involved are the current Pope Pius XII, the former Vatican Secretary of State (Foreign Minister) Cardinal Pacelli, and the "black Pope" - the Protestant senior priest Bishop Dohos.

　　New York Archbishop Spellman, who does business in whiskey and Coca-Cola and also operates a kerosene business, went to Italy, an enemy country, six times throughout the war, exchanged opinions with Pius XII on political issues between the two future "strong countries" - the United States and the Vatican, and reached an agreement. In Rome, Mr. Mellon Taylor, a member of the Morgan family and Roosevelt's personal representative, was stationed. In the Pope's reception room, he held negotiations with Germans, Italians, and Spaniards.

　　In August 1947, Truman, in a letter to Pope Pius XII of Rome, called on the "earthly agent of God" to jointly fight against communism. The "God's agent" promised to strengthen the church organization to oppose the struggle of the Communist Party and the People's Democratic movement. The Vatican takes all measures to help American imperialism. Pius XII ordered Catholic propaganda to implement the necessity of the Marshall Plan, which brought unemployment, hunger, and poverty to the people of Europe. Recently, he has also worked to strengthen the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance.

　　Cardinal Mindszenty, the protagonist of the Hungarian treason case, confessed during the trial his collusion with the American reactionaries. He wanted to use American aid to overthrow the Hungarian People's Democratic regime. Eighty percent of the Vatican's income now comes from the United States, and it spends 250 million US dollars annually on propaganda against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. The Pope of Rome supports the plan of the American reactionaries who are preparing for the Third World War against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. He curses all communists and their sympathizers and those who strive for peace.

　　The predecessor of the current Pope and his friend - Pius XI - once said that if the interests of the holy Catholic Church required it, he was prepared to form an alliance with the devil. Now Pius XII has found this ally, and he has hung the Vatican's cross on the chariot of American imperialism's attempt to dominate the world.

　　Patriotic Catholics who maintain true doctrine and oppose imperialist aggression should know what attitude to take towards such a Vatican curia.

　　梵蒂岗  帝国主义的工具
    张其华
    在影片“攻克柏林”里面，我们看到当希特勒狂喊要在十月革命节攻下莫斯科的时候，在那座大厅里向他歌功颂德的除了一干轴心仆从国家的使节以外，还有着梵蒂岗的代表。希特勒还特别亲昵地打趣这位“天使”，说他不如脱下袈裟，换上纳粹的制服。
    在另一部影片“秘密使节”中，我们也看到当法西斯德国就要灭亡的时节，德寇的情报负责人舍林别格尔替美国向巴尔干布置大批的特务、间谍，在布达佩斯、索非亚、伯尔格莱德……同美国的使节的代表和美国使馆建立关系，指使他们“混进人民民主国家的各部院、部队，混进祖国战线的政府里去，混进共产党的领导机关”，并且要“组织恐怖性活动，消灭共产主义的领袖们，打死共产党员们”。而在这些接受任务的各地特务头子里面，就有着挂着十字架的大主教在内。
    这两部影片中所描写的完全不是虚构，也不是什么夸张。这是梵蒂岗与帝国主义勾结，进行反人民阴谋罪恶的正确记录。
    梵蒂岗和帝国主义间的关系是由来已久了。在第二次大战前后，梵蒂岗和法西斯间的勾搭，早已为人们所知。当墨索里尼在意大利取得政权时，教皇庇护十一世宣称：“这是神赐给我们的人！”佛朗哥则一直被梵蒂岗誉为“天主教会的忠诚之子”。一九三三年七月二十日，帕赛利红衣主教（现在的教皇庇护十二世）就和希特勒主要干部巴本订立了条约，规定所有的德国主教都须向希特勒第三帝国作矢志的效忠。事实上，德国的天主教会就是根据梵蒂岗的直接指示来赞助希特勒取得政权的。
    当墨索里尼侵略阿比西尼亚的时候，教皇说这是“基于高度博爱的传布文明的使命”。德国的重整军备，萨拉柴在葡萄牙、佛朗哥在西班牙的握得政权，德国并吞奥地利，慕尼黑会议，英法对捷克斯洛伐克的出卖，斯洛伐克的割让，墨索里尼的侵入阿尔巴尼亚，希特勒对波兰的进攻，希特勒进攻法国，和最后，希特勒向苏联的进攻——所有这些，都得到梵蒂岗的赞同和支持。
    梵蒂岗这个“天国”的外交政策是很清楚的。在一九四四年美国外交政策协会的会报“外交政策报告”一月号上，发表过海顿写的一篇文章，题目叫“梵蒂岗的外交政策”。海顿在他的文章中也不得不承认“梵蒂岗在过去二十年中一直显示着亲法西斯政府的倾向”。他说明梵蒂岗的政策是由于“固执地死抱住一种希望，他们相信法西斯国家能够抵制共产主义而保卫‘文明’”。海顿也叙述了梵蒂岗对于“墨索里尼扩展政策”的支持，米兰红衣主教休斯特的好战成性，打败共和军时庇护十二世致佛朗哥的二次贺电，以及“意大利和西班牙法西斯党人获得教会的合作”等等事实。
    关于梵蒂岗的政策问题，巴西的一位主教杜亚特的话是可以引证的。他在一九四六年十一月写道：“不幸教皇总是固执地坚持着纳粹和法西斯的方法。他参与法西斯的队伍，为第二次世界大战开辟道路。现在梵蒂岗和帝国主义在一起并肩前进了，它本身就是帝国主义中最狰狞可怕的一个。”
    这样我们就不难了解：在二次大战爆发以后，对于华沙、伦敦和阿姆斯特丹的残酷轰炸，和平市民的惨遭屠戮以及希魔对于千百万人民的淫虐狂的残杀，“博爱仁慈”的梵蒂岗从来没有一次抗议过。一九四一年七月二十四日，法国的红衣主教和大主教们召集会议通过叛国声明的时候，梵蒂岗也装作不知，不作丝毫表示。那声明说：“我们尊崇国家的元首（按即贝当），我们要求所有的法国人集合在他的周围……我们向一切天主教徒呼吁，协助他进行复兴的工作。我们希望获得教会的合作，一同来完成这一共同的使命。”梵蒂岗对于他的属下的这样露骨的叛国叫嚣，不但不加以驳斥，反而给予积极的支持，就是因为梵蒂岗和法西斯根本是一丘之貉，同时，他们也是把贝当当作“天主教会的忠诚之子”的。
    事实上，当第二次大战爆发不久，经由阿尔费利的拉纤，教皇就和墨索里尼订立了秘密协定。法国“巴黎午报”在当时论述这个至今还未公开内容的秘密时说：“两个罗马之间的协定，在于共同抵制共产主义。”整个战争期间，德国人、意大利人川流不息地出现在教皇的身边。从直布罗陀到东京，到处奔走着梵蒂岗的代表。为了更好地跟东方法西斯通气，庇护十二世就承认日本天皇战犯裕仁所信奉的神道与耶稣教义是一致的，并在东京派驻了教廷使节。
    但是，战争不是按照梵蒂岗的“神意”而发展的，它服从于人民的愿望和意志而结束。法西斯倒下了，帝国主义削弱了，而人民胜利了，同时更强大了。
    梵蒂岗在战后积极从事的是这样几件事。
    首先，加紧拯救重要的法西斯匪徒。梵蒂岗、天主教教会和修道院变成了著名法西斯分子的避难所。前希特勒的代表威兹绥克和前维琪政府驻教廷代表倍阿德，得到庇护十二世的允准，都住在梵蒂岗的区域里面。法西斯的“斯洛伐克政府”代表茜多和该“政府”的外交部长杜尔康斯基，也都在那里逍遥法外。
    一九四五年十一月，教皇呼吁赦放二百个战争罪犯。庇护十二世在一九四五年圣诞祝词中威吓着说：“那些要求付出罪行的代价，惩罚犯人的人们，必须留心自己也犯了他人的罪行和过错。”过了一年，这位教皇于一九四六年二月在红衣主教学院中演讲时又宣称：“在国外，有一种错误的观念，以为加入某种团体的人（换言之，就是纳粹党员、ＳＳ队员、盖世太保）一定就是犯罪的。这实在是对上帝权力的一种无耻的侵害，因为只有他才能决定犯人和无辜者的命运，有罪和无罪者的命运。”显然用不着多做解释，任何人都看得出庇护十二世在庇护着谁，他的话又是在反对着谁。
    梵蒂岗拯救与保护法西斯匪徒一直到他们尸体。米兰的一个修道院方丈左卡，花了二十万里拉（意大利币名）组织了窃尸案，他们把被人民绞死的法西斯魔王墨索里尼，他们的“神赐之人”的尸体窃入，藏在修道院中，表示了梵蒂岗对法西斯“教”义的无限忠诚。
    梵蒂岗在战后所积极从事的第二件大事，就是在各国组织反动的天主教政党，打击人民的政党，分化进步力量，反对人民民主政权，布置特务暴徒，进行阴谋破坏和颠覆政府的叛乱行动。
    战后，在匈牙利就出现了一个名为“人民民主”党的天主教政党，它激烈地反对土地改革，破坏政府的各项民主措施。一九四八年二月匈牙利破获了以红衣主教明曾谛为首的阴谋叛乱和暴动的叛国案。从主教宫廷搜查出的文件和明曾谛的供词中，就完全证实了在这一群祖国的叛徒的后面，是有其支持者的。
    在捷克，一九四六年三月所破获的一个叛国的地下组织，就和梵蒂岗保持着密切的关系。这是一个相当于德国“狼人团”一样的组织，主持人柯拉维克是一个天主教神父，外国特务机关的爪牙。
    在波兰，洪德红衣主教在梵蒂岗指示下公开和秘密地反对着民主政权。在选举中他号召天主教徒对民主集团投反对票。贝鲁特总统在一九四六年十一月二十二日接见新闻记者时说：“到现在为止，一些波兰的教徒和反动分子站在一起，反对着民主政府所进行的改革方案。”
    在意大利，僧侣黑暗势力和梵蒂岗更直接的合作，站到反动派方面积极活动。米兰大主教、教皇内阁阁员舒尔吉斯曾下令：“不给共产党及其戴着人民民主阵线假面具的同情者、唯物论拥护者及投不能容忍的竞选人的票或一般不投票的人们免罪。”投人民民主阵线的票被宣布为“不可饶恕的罪恶”。
    在法国，以皮杜尔为首的天主教政党——人民共和党赖梵蒂岗的帮助成立了起来，它积极地打击与分化左翼政党。法国“地平线”杂志（一九四六年十一月号）写道：人民共和党有着幕后领导人——那是支持过维琪政府的许多主教，他们直接听命于罗马（即梵蒂岗）。
    在德国，梵蒂岗拚命想使中央党复活。同时，它也在基督教社会同盟中展开活动。这是一个继承天主教巴伐利里亚人民党的组织。战犯巴本逃过了绞头台，却又领导起德国的天主教来了。
    在奥国，梵蒂岗通过天主教的团体来展开工作，这团体自命为“人民”党。此外，以高级司铎佛里特为首的天主教行动会也复活了，扩大了它的活动范围，而佛里特正是苏台德德国人英尼策红衣主教所指派的。“人民”党的机关报“国民小报”日报和“畦”周刊对梵蒂岗恭维备至，主张组织天主教国家联盟，竭力使奥国倾向西方，对苏联大肆攻击。
    在中国，教皇则赏识了特务头子于斌。在献县和正定“公教报国团”的案件中，我们更真切地看到帝国主义和梵蒂岗伸入到中国的魔爪。
    最后，梵蒂岗最重要的步骤是和美国帝国主义的“加强团结”。其实，天上的最大“强国”——梵蒂岗——和地上最大“强国”——美国——的奇妙姻缘是早已缔结了。月老和当事人就是现今的教皇庇护十二世、当年梵蒂岗的国务卿（外交部长）帕赛利红衣主教及“黑色的教皇”——新教徒的僧长多霍甫斯主教。
    做威士忌和可口可乐生意兼营煤油业的纽约大主教斯派尔曼在整个战时到敌国的意大利去过六次，对于未来的两大“强国”——美国和梵蒂岗间交换政治问题的意见，与庇护十二世获得协议。在罗马则驻着罗斯福的私人代表、摩根家族的一员梅隆·泰罗先生，在教皇的接待室里，他和德国人、意大利人及西班牙人举行谈判。
    一九四七年八月，杜鲁门曾在致罗马教皇庇护十二世的函中号召“上帝地上代理人”共同跟共产主义进行斗争。“上帝代理人”应允加强教会组织以反对共产党及人民民主运动的斗争。梵蒂岗采取一切方策来援助美帝国主义。庇护十二世责令天主教宣传实行马歇尔计划的必要，这一计划给欧洲人民带来了失业、饥饿和贫困。最近，他还为加强侵略性的北大西洋联盟而努力。
    匈牙利叛国案主角红衣主教明曾谛在受审时已供认出他和美国反动派的勾结，他想借美国的援助来推翻匈牙利的人民民主政权。梵蒂岗现在百分之八十的收入来自美国，而它每年在反对苏联和人民民主国家的宣传上花费二亿五千万美金。罗马教皇支持美国反动派正在准备的反对苏联和人民民主国家的第三次世界大战的计划。他诅咒一切共产党人及其同情者和争取和平的人们。
    现今教皇的前任和他的友人——庇护十一世——以前曾讲过：如果神圣的天主教会的利益要求这样做，他准备和魔鬼结成同盟。现在庇护十二世找到了这个同盟者，他把梵蒂岗的十字架挂在美帝国主义企图统治世界的战车上了。
    维护真正教义，反对帝国主义侵略的爱国的天主教徒，应该知道自己对这样的梵蒂岗教廷采取什么样的态度。
