　　People's Navy Political Department Holds a Meeting
    To Welcome New Students Joining Naval Schools

    [Report from this newspaper] The Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Navy held a meeting at 1:00 PM on the 10th to welcome young students joining naval schools. At the meeting, Deputy Director Xia of the Youth Department of the Navy Political Department, on behalf of the People's Navy, warmly welcomed the young students who honorably joined the army. He called on the young students to humbly learn from the veteran workers and peasants their firm political stance and selfless fighting spirit; they must temper themselves in practical life, transform enthusiasm into a long-term, solid, and persevering strength to overcome all difficulties in study and work.

    Liu Shuxian, an old woman and family member of a student joining the naval school, walked onto the stage with a smile. She happily said, "My eldest son joined the People's Air Force the day before yesterday, and today my second son joined the People's Navy. It's not bad that I gave birth to these two sons, they have earned glory for their mother who is over sixty!" She changed her tone and said, "Before liberation, I would absolutely not allow my children to join the army, because every additional soldier in the reactionary army meant one more villain who brought disaster to the country and the people! I would rather die than have my children become villains, I am their mother! But now, the world has changed. The People's Liberation Army is the most outstanding son of the people, our own army, dedicated to fighting enemies, defending the motherland, and consolidating the people's power, so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment. My two sons can endure hardship and are brave, so I not only don't object but also encourage them to join the army." When family member Zhao Daye spoke, he said, "I saw so many young lads wearing red flowers, all beaming with joy, especially my child was among them, I was extremely excited! I saw the growing strength of the motherland's navy." He also encouraged the children with the loving tone of a parent, saying: "Children, I am very relieved that you are leaving the family to join the big family of the revolutionary ranks, but joining the army is only the glorious beginning. I hope you will strive for the highest glory in future study, work, and combat, and become naval heroes and models." Zhang Yanzhang and Wu Zhaolin, representatives of the students joining the naval school, made a guarantee to the organization and parents on behalf of all the students joining the naval school: "In the future, we must study hard, master naval technology, and develop into strong Mao Zedong fighters, to strike at aggressors at sea, and live up to the ardent expectations of the people of the whole country."

　　人民海军政治部举行大会
    欢迎参加海军学校新学员
    【本报讯】人民解放军海军政治部，于十日下午一时举行大会，欢迎参加海军学校的青年学生。会上，海军政治部青年部夏副部长代表人民海军热烈欢迎青年同学光荣入伍，并号召青年同学虚心地向工农老同志学习坚定的政治立场与忘我的斗争精神；必须在实际生活中锻炼自己，把热情化为长期的、巩固的、坚忍不拔的力量，去克服一切在学习上工作上的困难。
    参加海军学校同学的家属刘淑先老大娘笑眯眯地走上讲台，她高兴地说：“我的大小子前天参加到人民空军去了，今天二小子又参加了人民海军，生这两个小子总算不赖，跟我这六十多岁的母亲挣来了光荣！”她换了一个口气说：“解放以前，我是绝对不准孩子当兵的，因为反动派的军队多一个，就是多一个祸国殃民的坏蛋！宁死我也不愿孩子作坏蛋，我是孩子的母亲呀！可是现在呢，世道变了，人民解放军是人民最优秀的儿子，是咱们自己的队伍，专打敌人，保卫祖国，巩固人民政权，使老百姓安居乐业。我的两个小子能吃苦，也勇敢，所以我不但不反对而且鼓励他俩参军。”家属赵大爷讲话时说：“我看到这许多年青小伙子戴着红花，一个个兴高采烈，尤其我的孩子也在内，我兴奋极啦！我看到了祖国海军日益壮大的气象。”他并以家长的慈爱口吻勉励孩子们说：孩子离开家庭到革命队伍的大家庭，我是很放心的，不过参军只是光荣的开始，希望你们今后在学习中、工作中、战斗中争取最高的光荣，作海军英雄模范。”参加海军学校学生的代表张彦章、吴兆麟代表参加海军学校的全体同学，向组织、向家长提出保证：“今后一定要好好学习，掌握海军技术，锻炼成坚强的毛泽东战士，在海上打击侵略者，不辜负全国人民的热望。”
