    Our Great Motherland
    This is a stone-carved Buddha statue from the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, a famous Chinese work of art. This open-air Buddha statue is fifteen meters tall from the waist up, and the ears are two meters and fifty-five centimeters long. In the grottoes, which are approximately one kilometer long from east to west, there are seven large Buddhas and nearly six hundred thousand small Buddhas, all works of art carved during the Northern Wei Dynasty about 1,500 years ago.
