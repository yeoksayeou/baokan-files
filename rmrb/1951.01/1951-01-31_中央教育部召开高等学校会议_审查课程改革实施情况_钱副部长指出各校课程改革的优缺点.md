The Ministry of Education Convenes a Conference of Higher Education Institutions
　　Reviews the Implementation of Curriculum Reform
　　Vice Minister Qian Points Out the Advantages and Disadvantages of Curriculum Reform in Various Schools
　　[Report from this newspaper] In order to examine the implementation of the "Decision on Implementing Curriculum Reform in Higher Education Institutions" passed at the Higher Education Conference by higher education institutions nationwide, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened the 1950 Annual Teaching Plan Review Conference for Higher Education Institutions in Beijing from January 23rd to 26th. The main purpose of this conference was to urge higher education institutions nationwide to value teaching plans and gradually move towards planned teaching. Also, through the review work, to understand the implementation of the curriculum in various schools, to learn from experience, to identify problems, and to use them as a reference for curriculum reform work, so as to better promote curriculum reform work in the future. During the conference, Minister of Education Ma Xulun, and Vice Ministers Qian Junrui, Wei Que, and Zeng Zhaolun all attended and spoke. They unanimously pointed out the importance of this review work for future curriculum reform work.
　　During the conference, the review work was conducted in groups, divided into 23 groups from six departments: Arts, Law, Science, Engineering, Agriculture, and Teacher Training. The Ministry of Education invited 120 university professors and experts from the Beijing-Tianjin area to jointly carry out the review work. Based on the materials from 135 schools that have been reported to the Ministry, in-depth reviews were first conducted on key schools and departments to gain experience, while others were given general inspections. The content of this review focused on the following points: (1) The completeness of the education plan. (2) The offering of compulsory public courses. (3) Whether the offering of political courses conforms to the Ministry's regulations. (4) Whether there are appropriate arrangements for internships. (5) Whether the class hours or credits exceed the regulations. (6) Whether the allocation of study time is reasonable, and whether the calculation of credits follows the regulations. (7) Whether the courses offered conform to the principle of simplification. (8) Whether the curriculum plan can achieve appropriate specialization on the basis of systematic theory. (9) The systematic nature of elective courses offered. (10) The degree to which the teaching content is connected with practice. (11) The planning of the entire department's teaching.
　　On the morning of the 26th, a tea party was held for all the personnel participating in the review work. Minister Ma Xulun and Vice Ministers Qian Junrui, Wei Que, and Zeng Zhaolun attended and spoke. Minister Ma pointed out: Today, the Ministry of Education is conducting this inspection based on the new education policy, which is first to transform the old education so that it can meet the needs of the new social construction. Curriculum reform is an important part of transforming the old education. The work done in curriculum reform in the past has already yielded certain gains, and we should continue to work hard in the future. This review of teaching plans can serve as a basis for further promoting curriculum reform work. Vice Ministers Wei and Zeng pointed out that with the help of professors and experts, this review of teaching plans has yielded great results. Vice Minister Qian also summarized the problems and experiences raised by the various review groups in the past few days and made a report.
　　Vice Minister Qian first pointed out that out of the 206 higher education institutions nationwide, 135 have already submitted teaching plans, which shows that most schools attach importance to teaching plans, but 71 schools have not yet submitted teaching plans, which needs to be criticized. Secondly, he pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of the implementation of curriculum reform in various schools that were discovered in this review: generally, the schools can attach importance to political and ideological education, stipulate the study of political courses, the teaching content also tends to the connection between theory and practice, the arrangement of courses is gradually becoming planned, and many schools have established teaching and research groups, which play a great role in teaching. However, there are also many shortcomings, such as a small number of schools not paying enough attention to education plans, some schools failing to carry out curriculum reform well in accordance with the spirit of the curriculum reform decision, some schools submitting teaching plans that are relatively formalistic and cannot be implemented, some schools having complex curricula with many courses set up for specific individuals, some schools offering too many elective courses, some curriculum content not meeting the needs of national construction, and individual schools rashly canceling certain courses when formulating teaching plans, and some teaching materials or reference books having chaotic content. All of the above shortcomings need to be corrected. However, because a summary has not yet been made, it is not comprehensive enough and is for reference only. Finally, he emphasized that the future direction of teaching should be to implement the curriculum reform policy of the Higher Education Conference, so that education closely cooperates with the needs of national construction, and that theory and practice are closely linked. In addition, he also gave instructions on the issues of faculty, teaching materials, and equipment raised by the various review groups. Many professors and experts expressed their opinions at the tea party, and put forward suggestions on implementing the curriculum reform policy and solving the problems of faculty, teaching materials, and equipment. Finally, Vice Minister Zeng Zhaolun gave answers based on the current specific situation and conditions.
　　The conference ended on the afternoon of the 26th, and the various review groups submitted written summary reports to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education will, based on the review results, issue instructions on general issues in the implementation of the curriculum reform decision for various colleges and universities, commend those who have achieved success in promoting curriculum reform in individual colleges and universities, and criticize and instruct those who have not been effective in promoting curriculum reform.

　　中央教育部召开高等学校会议
    审查课程改革实施情况
    钱副部长指出各校课程改革的优缺点
    【本报讯】中央人民政府教育部为检查全国各高等学校对高教会议中通过的《关于实施高等学校课程改革决定》的执行情形，于一月二十三日至二十六日在京召开了全国高等学校一九五○年度教学计划审查会议。此次会议的召开主要在于促使全国各高等学校重视教学计划，逐步走向计划教学。并于审查工作中，了解各学校课程实施的情况，吸取经验，发现问题，作为课程改革工作的参考，以便于今后更好的推进课程改革工作。会议期间，教育部马叙伦部长、钱俊瑞、韦悫、曾昭抡等副部长均出席讲话。一致指出这次会议的审查工作对今后课程改革工作的重要性。
    会议中，审查工作是按小组进行的，分为、文、法、理、工、农、师范六院共二十三个小组。由教育部邀请了京津地区的大学教授和专家一百二十人共同执行审查工作。根据已报部的一百三十五校的材料，首先择重点校系进行深入审查，以取得经验，其它则作了一般的检查。此次审查内容着重下列各点：（一）教育计划的完整程度。（二）公共必修课程的开设。（三）政治课的开设是否照部规定。（四）实习有无适当的布置。（五）学时或学分是否超出规定。（六）学习时间的分配是否合理，学分的计算法是否按照规定。（七）课程开设是否合乎精简原则。（八）课程计划是否能达到在系统理论的基础上实行适当的专门化。（九）选修课程开设的系统性。（十）教学内容与实际联系的程度。（十一）整个系的教学的计划性。
    二十六日上午参加审查工作的全体人员举行茶会。会上马叙伦、钱俊瑞、韦悫、曾昭抡等正副部长均出席讲话。马部长指出：今天教育部是根据新的教育方针，首先是改造旧教育，使能适合新社会建设需要的方针，来进行检查的。课程改革工作是改造旧教育的重要一环，过去课程改革方面所作的工作已经有了一定的收获，今后应继续努力去作。此次审查教学计划可作为进一步推进课程改革工作的依据。韦副部长和曾副部长指出这次审查教学计划工作在教授专家的帮助下，有很大收获。钱副部长并综合了几日来各审查小组所提出的问题和经验，作了一个报告。
    钱副部长首先指出全国二百零六所高等学校中，现已呈报教学计划的有一百三十五校，这说明大多数学校是重视教学计划的，但有七十一校尚未呈报教学计划，这是需要提出批评的。其次他指出在这次审查中发现的各校实施课程改革中的优缺点：各校一般都能重视政治思想教育，规定了政治课的学习，教学内容也趋向于理论与实际的联系，课程的安排也逐渐走向计划性，而且很多学校都已成立了教研组，在教学上起着很大的作用。但也还存在着不少的缺点，如少数学校对教育计划重视不够，有些学校尚未能依照课程改革决定的精神很好的进行课程改革工作，有的学校呈报的教学计划比较形式主义，不能实现，有的学校课程繁杂，有不少因人设课的情形，有的学校选课特别多，有些课程内容不适合国家建设的需要，个别学校在拟定教学计划时，轻率地取消了某些课程，有些教本或参考书，内容杂乱。以上缺点都是需要纠正的。但因尚未作总结，还不够全面，仅供参考。最后他着重指出：今后教学上应努力的方向是贯彻高教会议的课程改革方针，使教育密切配合国家建设的需要，使理论与实际密切联系。此外他对各审查小组提出的关于师资、教材、设备等问题，也分别作了指示。茶会上许多教授、专家均发表意见，对于贯彻课程改革方针，以及解决师资、教材、设备问题提出建议。最后由曾昭抡副部长根据目前具体情况和条件做了解答。
    会议二十六日下午结束，各审查小组并有书面总结报告给教育部。教育部将根据审查结果对于各院校推行课程改革决定中的一般问题，作出指示，对个别院校推行课程改革有成绩者，予以表扬，对于推行课程改革不力者分别予以批评指示。（柏生）
