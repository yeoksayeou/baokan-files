　　About the Second Round of Enrollment for Military Cadre Schools
    Question: The General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission has issued a notice to recruit students for military medical, communications, logistics... and other schools. How do these schools relate to accelerating national defense construction?
    Answer: This recruitment of students, like the previous recruitment of students for air force, navy, and other schools, is also to accelerate the strengthening of national defense. Because the training of military doctors, communications personnel, logistics personnel, public security personnel, foreign language personnel, Russian language personnel, etc., is also an indispensable and important component of national defense construction. Although the nature of the schools recruiting students this time is different from the previous one, this is only a difference in the division of labor in national defense construction. Last time, the air force, navy... and other schools recruited students, and many applicants were not approved to participate due to the limited number of places. They felt great regret. This time, the recruitment of military medical, communications, logistics, foreign language, Russian language, and other schools provides a new opportunity for patriotic youth who are determined to participate in national defense construction.
    Question: Is registration for this recruitment of students completely voluntary?
    Answer: Yes, the principle of complete voluntariness must still be implemented. Those who did not register in the last recruitment or who registered but were not approved can decide whether to register or not based on the principle of voluntariness. Since this recruitment of students is also an important step in accelerating national defense construction, it will certainly receive an enthusiastic response from the vast number of patriotic youth.
    Question: What are the procedures for review and approval this time?
    Answer: The procedures for registration, review, approval, and reception are the same as last time.
    Question: How does the physical examination standard this time differ from the last time?
    Answer: The standards for the air force and navy are higher because of the needs of working conditions. This time, only good health, no infectious diseases, hidden ailments, and bad habits are required.

　　关于军事干部学校第二批招生
    问：中央人民政府革命军事委员会总政治部发出通告，招收军医、通讯、后勤……等校学员。这些学校，和加速国防建设关系如何？
    答：这次招收学员，和前次招收空海军等校学员，同样是为了加速增强国防力量。因为军医、通讯、后勤、公安、外文、俄文等人才的培养，同样是国防建设中不可缺少的重要组成部分。虽然这次招收学员的学校和上次性质不一样，但这仅仅是国防建设中分工的不同而已。上一次空军、海军……等校招生，因为招生名额所限，许多报名者未被批准参加。他们感到很大遗憾。这次军医、通讯、后勤、外文、俄文等校招生，就向有志参加国防建设的爱国青年提供了一次新的机会。
    问：这次招收学员，报名是否完全自愿？
    答：是的，仍须完全贯彻自愿的原则。上次招生没有报名或报名而未被批准的人，均可根据自愿的原则，决定自己报名或不报名。既然这次招收学员同样是加速国防建设的重要步骤，必将同样得到广大爱国青年的热烈响应。
    问：这次审查及批准的手续如何？
    答：这次报名、审查、批准及接收的手续和上次相同。
    问：这次体格检查标准与上次有何不同？
    答：空海军等因工作条件的需要，所以标准较高。这次只须身体健康，无传染病，暗疾及不良嗜好即可。
