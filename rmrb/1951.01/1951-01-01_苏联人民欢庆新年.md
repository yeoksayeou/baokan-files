Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th (TASS): 1950 was a year of further improvement in the living standards of the Soviet working people. The national sales of meat and meat products increased by 35 percent compared to pre-war levels, butter and other fats increased by 60 percent, cotton, wool, and linen fabrics increased by 38 percent, and sales of other items also saw substantial increases. However, on the eve of the New Year, the Soviet people's demand for various foods and consumer goods was particularly high. The orders received by grocery stores and food shops in Moscow were five times higher than usual. Orders included large quantities of delicious sausages, fish products, canned fish, fine wines, and pastries. The capital's stores have received 135 tons of sweets for decorating New Year trees and a large quantity of frozen fruits. The New Year's trade at collective farm markets in Moscow, Kyiv, Minsk, Tbilisi, and other capital cities of the republics was very active. Farmers transported thousands of tons of meat, butter, poultry, and vegetables from remote areas, which were quickly sold out.

　　苏联人民欢庆新年
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三十日讯：一九五○年是苏联劳动人民生活标准进一步提高的一年。全国一年出售的肉类和肉制品，较战前增加了百分之三十五，黄油和其他油脂增加了百分之六十，棉、毛、亚麻织品增加了百分之三十八，其它物品的销售量也有大量的增加。但在新年前夕，苏联人民对各种食品及消费品的需要量特别大。莫斯科各杂货店和食品商店所收到的订货单，较平日多五倍。订货包括大宗的美味香肠、鱼制品、罐头鱼、上等美酒和糕饼。首都的各商店已运到了一百三十五吨供装饰新年树之用的糖果和大批冰冻水果。莫斯科、基辅、明斯克、第比利斯及其他各加盟共和国首都的集体农场市场的年节贸易非常活跃，农民们从遥远地区运来的数千吨肉类、黄油、鸡鸭和菜蔬，很快就销售一空。
