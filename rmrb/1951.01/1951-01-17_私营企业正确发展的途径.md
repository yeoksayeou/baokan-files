　　"Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises" has been officially promulgated by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on New Year's Eve last year. Although this regulation is still temporary, it has clearly stipulated the correct path for the development of private enterprises.
    There are two basic questions regarding the development of private enterprises: First, how to promote the enthusiasm of private industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, in order to develop the people's economy; second, how to make private enterprises develop along the path of New Democracy, rather than along the path of ordinary capitalism. The Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises correctly solve these two aspects.
    Regarding the importance of private capitalism in the current stage of China, Chairman Mao has long had clear instructions. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Coalition Government" in April 1945 that we should "guarantee the legitimate profits of state enterprises, private enterprises, and cooperative enterprises under reasonable management." In December 1947, Chairman Mao said in "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "Due to the backwardness of China's economy, the capitalist economy represented by the broad petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie must be allowed to exist for a long time even after the victory of the revolution throughout the country; and according to the division of labor in the national economy, all parts of them that are beneficial to the national economy need to be developed; they are still an indispensable part of the entire national economy." In his report "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" published on July 1, 1949, Chairman Mao also said: "The national bourgeoisie has great importance at the present stage." After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao's thought was also written into the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Article 26 of the Common Program stipulates: "To enable various social economic components to cooperate under the leadership of the state-owned economy, to divide labor and cooperate, and to give each its due, in order to promote the development of the entire social economy." Article 30 stipulates: "The People's Government should encourage the enthusiasm of private economic enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and assist their development." Therefore, there is no doubt that private enterprises are protected by the people's country.
    However, in order to promote the enthusiasm of private enterprises, stipulate the methods of activities of private enterprises, and concretize the policy of protecting private enterprises, it is necessary to formulate special regulations. The Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises are for solving this problem. The Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises focus on stipulating the method of distributing enterprise surpluses. The main purpose of private industrialists and businessmen investing in and operating various enterprises is of course to obtain profits. If the requirements of investors cannot be met in this regard, it will inevitably weaken their enthusiasm for investment. Therefore, Article 25 of the Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises stipulates that dividends can reach an annual interest rate of 8%, the public reserve fund accounts for 10% of the surplus, and the remuneration for shareholder bonuses, directors, supervisors, managers, factory directors, etc., should generally not be less than 60% of the surplus after the dividend distribution. The profits obtained from capitalist production are undoubtedly the surplus value created by the hard work of the working class, but in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the bourgeoisie for investing in production, the New Democratic economic system allows the bourgeoisie to implement this limited exploitation of the working class. After the capital side implements a reasonable wage system, labor insurance system, safety and health system, and other labor laws, it should be recognized that the capital side has the right to obtain the majority of the surplus as their legitimate profit. At a time when there is still a large amount of idle capital separated from production, such a policy of benefiting both labor and capital is conducive to absorbing social idle capital into private production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, that is, it is in line with the current and long-term interests of the working class.
    In the distribution of surpluses, the Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises not only take into account the immediate interests of investors, but also take into account the safety of the enterprise itself, that is, taking into account the longer-term interests of investors. Therefore, Article 25 of the regulations stipulates that "when the company has no surplus or has losses, the dividends to be issued may be appropriately reissued after making up for the losses in the year with a surplus." This opposes the idea of ​​paying dividends regardless of whether there is a surplus or not. Because if dividends are also paid when there is a loss, it will obviously affect the safety of the enterprise. The regulations also opposed the idea of ​​requiring dividends to be based on the current interest rate of bank deposits. The current interest rate of bank deposits is around 20% per annum. If such a high dividend is implemented, most legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises will obviously be unable to bear it. If the enterprise cannot develop healthily or even cannot survive in order to give investors more dividends, this is obviously unfavorable to investors. Therefore, dividends should be limited to a certain range, and after the surplus is used for public reserve and dividend distribution, it should be distributed to shareholders in the form of bonuses, which is the safest practice for private enterprises. The regulations stipulate that more than 10% of the surplus should first be set aside as public reserve, and stipulate that: "The principle of surplus distribution is not to affect regular production and business operations." This is entirely for the sake of the safety of the enterprise. Any enterprise manager and far-sighted investor will undoubtedly fully agree with these regulations.
    However, private enterprises in New Democratic countries must accept the leadership of the national economy and abide by all national labor laws. This conforms to the basic policy of "taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital."
    Private enterprises must obey the leadership of the national economy, which is one of the basic principles of the Common Program's economic policy. Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises clearly stipulates this. In New Democratic countries, private capital should not only not engage in monopolistic and speculative undertakings, but also avoid the blind competition of capitalism. Therefore, Article 11 of the regulations stipulates: "In order to cooperate with planned production; protect the interests of investors, and avoid blind development, newly established enterprises should report to the local competent authority for approval of business in accordance with laws and regulations before they can be established." "Enterprises must not engage in business outside the approved scope." Enterprises that have been registered and established must also apply for approval if they need to change their business scope. Article 6 of the regulations also stipulates: "In order to overcome blind production, adjust production and sales relations, and gradually move towards a planned economy, the government may formulate production and sales plans for certain important commodities when necessary, and both public and private enterprises shall abide by them." Since the second half of last year, various departments of the Central People's Government's financial and economic work have held more than a dozen professional meetings attended by representatives of public and private enterprises, formulated production and sales plans based on the principle of "determining production based on sales," and overcome some difficulties in production. Facts have fully proved that such regulations are in line with the common interests of the state and private industrialists and businessmen.
    Another restriction that private enterprises should accept is that they must implement the provisions of Article 7 of the regulations: "Enterprises should earnestly implement all government labor laws." First, reasonable wages, second, necessary welfare (labor insurance) and necessary safety and health equipment. In this regard, the government will issue other laws and regulations to protect it. Industrial and mining enterprises must have certain safety and health equipment, and employee welfare (labor insurance) must also have certain guarantees; these two expenditures should be included in regular expenditures regardless of whether the enterprise has a surplus or not. Not only that, in addition to regular expenses, private enterprises must also propose a certain amount of profit to take care of the common interests of employees. Therefore, Article 25 of the regulations stipulates that among the balance of the enterprise surplus after the public reserve is made and dividends are distributed, in addition to the shareholder bonuses and the remuneration for directors, supervisors, managers, factory directors, etc., generally no less than 60%, at least 30% should be used for the following two aspects: 1. Improvement of the safety and health equipment fund, of which industrial and mining enterprises should generally not be less than 15%; 2. Employee welfare fund and employee bonus, etc., should generally not be less than 15%. Since the surplus of the enterprise is entirely the result of the hard work of the employees, the proportion of labor in the distribution of surplus stipulated in the regulations is obviously not large. Article 8 of the regulations also stipulates that when investors exercise their management rights, all "matters related to the interests of both labor and capital should be resolved through labor-capital consultation meetings or labor-capital negotiations." Past experience has also fully proved that these labor laws and labor-capital consultation systems are extremely conducive to the development of production and the adjustment of labor-capital relations, and are an important feature of the New Democratic economy.
    The Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises, precisely because of the above-mentioned correct adjustments to the different interests of the national economy and private capitalist economy, as well as the different interests of the working class and the bourgeoisie, will have an important role in promoting the healthy development of my country's private capitalist economy at present. This is a document that formulates the interrelationships between several economic components and several classes in China, and it is a document worthy of serious study and resolute support by the people of the whole country.

### 私营企业正确发展的途径

　　私营企业正确发展的途径
    “私营企业暂行条例”已由中央人民政府政务院于去年除夕正式公布。这个条例虽然还是暂时的，但已经明确地规定了私营企业正确发展的途径。
    关于私营企业的发展有两个基本问题：第一，如何发扬有益于国计民生的私营工商业的积极性，以发展人民经济；第二，如何使私营企业按照新民主主义的轨道发展，而不按照普通资本主义的轨道发展。私营企业暂行条例就正确地解决了这两个方面的问题。
    关于私人资本主义在现阶段的中国的重要性，毛主席早已有了明确的指示。毛主席在一九四五年四月在论联合政府一书中即已指出，应当“保证国家企业、私人企业与合作社企业在合理经营下的正当赢利”。一九四七年十二月毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”中说：“由于中国经济的落后性，广大的小资产阶级与中等资产阶级所代表的资本主义经济，即使革命在全国胜利以后，在一个长时期内，还是必须允许他们存在；并且按照国民经济的分工，还需要他们中一切有益于国民经济的部分有一个发展；他们在整个国民经济中还是不可缺少的一部分。”毛主席在一九四九年七月一日所发表的《论人民民主专政》的报告中，也说：“民族资产阶级在现阶段上，有其很大的重要性。”在中华人民共和国成立以后，毛主席这个思想，又写进了人民政协所通过的共同纲领。共同纲领第二十六条规定：“使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。”第三十条规定：“凡有利于国计民生的私营经济企业，人民政府应鼓励其经营的积极性，并扶助其发展。”因此，私营企业之受人民国家的保护，是丝毫没有疑问的。
    但是为了发扬私人企业的积极性，规定私人企业的活动方法，使保护私人企业的政策具体化，还必须制定专门的条例。私营企业暂行条例就是为着解决这个问题的。私营企业暂行条例着重规定了企业盈余的分配方法。私人工商业家投资经营各种企业，其主要目的当然是在取得利润。如果在这方面不能满足投资人的要求，那就必然会削弱他们投资的积极性。因此，私营企业暂行条例第二十五条规定股息可达年息百分之八，公积金占盈余百分之十，股东红利及董事、监察人、经理人、厂长等的酬劳金，一般在股息分配后的盈余中应不少于百分之六十。资本主义生产所获得的这种利润，无疑是工人阶级辛苦劳动所创造的剩余价值，但是为了刺激资产阶级投资生产的积极性，新民主主义的经济制度是容许资产阶级对工人阶级实行这种有限度的剥削的。在资方执行了合理的工资制度，劳动保险制度，安全卫生制度及其他劳动法令后，应该承认资方有权利获得盈余的大部分，作为他们的合法的利润。在目前还有大量游资脱离生产的时候，这样的劳资两利政策，是有利于把社会游资吸收到有利于国计民生的私营生产事业上来的，也就是说，是符合于工人阶级的目前利益和长远利益的。
    在盈余分配中，私营企业暂行条例不仅照顾到投资人眼前的利益，而且照顾了企业本身的安全，也就是照顾了投资人较长远的利益。因此，条例第二十五条规定“公司无盈余或有亏损时，其应发的股息，得于有盈余的年度弥补亏损后酌情补发。”这就是反对那种不管有无盈余都要发股息的思想。因为如果亏本亦发股息，这样显然将影响到企业的安全。条例也反对了那种要求股息以目前银行存款利息作标准的思想。目前银行存款利息在年息百分之二十上下。如果实行这样高的股息，大多数正当的工商业是显然无力负担的。如果为着给投资人以更多的股息，而使企业不能健全发展，甚至不能生存，这，对于投资人显然是不利的。因此，应当把股息限制在一定的范围内，在提存公积、分派股息后的盈余额中，再以红利的形式分派给股东，这是对私营企业最安全的作法。条例中规定盈余应先提百分之十以上作为公积，以及规定：“盈余分配以不影响经常生产及业务经营为原则”。这完全是为着企业的安全着想。任何企业的经理人和有远见的投资人，对于这些规定无疑是会完全赞同的。
    但是，新民主主义国家中的私营企业，一定要接受国家经济的领导，和遵守国家一切劳动法令。这才符合于“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的基本方针。
    私营企业必须服从国家经济的领导，是共同纲领经济政策中基本原则之一。私营企业暂行条例在第一条中即对此作了明确的规定。在新民主主义国家中，私人资本不仅不能从事垄断和投机的事业，而且应避免资本主义的盲目竞争。因此，条例第十一条规定：“为配合计划生产；保护投资人利益、避免盲目发展，新创设的企业应依法令报经地方主管机关核准营业，方得筹设。”“企业不得经营核准范围以外的业务。”已登记创设之企业，如须变更营业范围，亦应申请核准。条例第六条又规定：“为克服盲目生产，调整产销关系，逐渐走向计划经济，政府得于必要时制定某些重要商品的产销计划，公私企业均应遵照执行。”去年下半年来中央人民政府财经工作各部门曾举行了十余次有公私企业代表参加的各种专业会议，根据“以销定产”原则制定了产销计划，克服了生产中的若干困难。事实已经充分证明这样的规定是合于国家与私营工商业家的共同利益的。
    私营企业所应当接受的另一个限制，即必须实现条例第七条的规定：“企业应切实执行政府一切有关劳动法令。”首先是合理的工资，其次是必要的福利（劳动保险）和必要的安全卫生设备。在这方面，政府即将另订法令予以保护。工矿企业必须有一定的安全卫生设备，职工福利（劳动保险）亦必须有一定的保证；这两项开支是不管企业有无盈余，应当列入经常开支的。不仅如此，在经常开支以外，私营企业还须提出一定的盈利来照顾职工们的共同利益。因此，条例第二十五条规定，企业盈余在提存公积和分派股息之后的余额中，除派股东红利及董事、监察人、经理人、厂长等酬劳金，一般应不少于百分之六十外，应有至少百分之三十用于下述两个方面：一、改善安全卫生设备基金，其中，工矿企业一般应不少于百分之十五；二、职工福利基金及职工奖励金等，一般应不少于百分之十五。企业的盈余，既然完全是职工们辛苦劳动所得到的结果，条例规定劳方在盈余分配上所占的比例，显然是不大的。条例第八条又规定投资人在执行其经营管理权时，凡“与劳资双方利益有关者，应由劳资协商会议或劳资双方协商解决”。过去经验亦已充分证明，这些劳动法令和劳资协商制度，极有利于生产的发展和劳资关系的调整，是新民主主义经济中的一个重要的特点。
    私营企业暂行条例，正因为对于国家经济和私人资本主义经济的不同利益以及对于工人阶级和资产阶级的不同利益作了上述的正确的调节，所以对于目前我国私人资本主义经济的健全发展，将有重要的推动作用。这是一个制定中国几种经济成份和几个阶级相互关系的文件，这是一个值得全国人民加以认真研究和坚决支持的文件。
