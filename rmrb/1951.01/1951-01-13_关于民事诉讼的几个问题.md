　　Several Questions Regarding Civil Litigation
　　Question: Do the People's Courts collect court fees for civil lawsuits involving property rights? If court fees are collected, what happens if the parties are unable to pay?
　　Answer: The Central People's Government has not yet promulgated a unified civil and criminal procedure law. People's Courts in various regions now have provisional measures for handling civil and criminal cases based on their local specific circumstances. Therefore, the collection of court fees for civil cases involving property rights varies from place to place. If the local People's Court stipulates the collection of court fees for civil litigation involving property rights, and individual parties rely entirely on their labor for a living or are indeed impoverished and unable to prepay, they may apply for approval to be exempted from prepaying part or all of the fees.
　　Question: What happens if a civil defendant hides and fails to appear in court?
　　Answer: If a civil defendant hides and fails to appear in court, the plaintiff can investigate the defendant's actual location and inform the court. If the defendant is summoned by the court but fails to appear without a valid reason, the court may compel their appearance. If the defendant's whereabouts are unknown and the plaintiff is unable to investigate, as long as the defendant's original household registration has not changed, the court can send the summons to the defendant's original residence, to be received by a family member living with them. If there is no residence or no family member to receive the summons on their behalf, the plaintiff may request the court to serve the summons by public announcement. After the summons has been received by a family member or served by public announcement by the court, if the defendant still fails to appear after the deadline, the court may, based on the request of one party and with conclusive evidence, render a default judgment.
　　Question: In cases involving the pursuit of property rights, if the defendant avoids appearing, how can the defendant be made to execute the court's judgment?
　　Answer: In cases involving the pursuit of property rights, if the defendant avoids appearing, in addition to requesting the court to detain them or serve by public announcement and render a default judgment, if it is ascertained that the defendant does indeed have property, the plaintiff may also request the court to provisionally seize their property to ensure enforcement after the judgment becomes final.

　　关于民事诉讼的几个问题
    问：人民法院对涉及财产权的民事诉讼是否要收审判费？如果要收审判费，当事人无力缴纳怎么办？
    答：中央人民政府尚未颁布统一的民刑诉讼法，各地人民法院现在都按其当地具体情况分别定有办理民刑案件暂行办法。因之，涉及财产权民事案件收审判费问题，各地尚不一致。如当地人民法院对于涉及财产权的民事诉讼规定征收审判费，而个别当事人因全赖劳动生活或确属赤贫无力预缴者，得声请核准免予预缴一部或全部。
    问：民事被告匿不出庭，怎么办？
    答：民事被告匿不出庭，原告可调查被告之确实所在，告知法院。如经法院传唤，被告无正当理由而不到者，法院得强制其到案。如被告所在不明，原告无法调查时，只要被告原有户籍未变，法院可将传票送到被告的原住居所，由其同居亲属代收；无住居所或无亲属代收传票者，原告还可以请求法院公示送达。经过家属代收传票或法院公示送达后，被告逾期仍不到案，法院即可根据一造之声请，以确实的证据，迳予缺席判决。
    问：关于财产权的诉追案件，被告避不露面，如何能使被告执行法院的判决？
    答：关于财产权之诉追案件，被告如避不露面，原告除可请求法院拘提或公示送达、缺席判决外，如查明该被告自己确有财产，亦得请求法院酌将其财产先行扣押，以供判决确定后的强制执行。
