Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: Since March 1950, national prices have been basically stable. This is one of the most important events in modern Chinese history.

According to the weighted index of 32 major commodities in six major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, Chongqing, and Guangzhou (with December 31, 1949, as the base period: 100), the index on December 26, 1950, was 176.7, an increase of only 76.7 percent compared to a year ago, fundamentally reversing the trend of four price fluctuations and a nineteen-fold increase in prices throughout 1949.

In order to stabilize prices, the Central People's Government has taken a series of effective measures over the past year: First, the unified leadership and management of national financial and economic work was implemented from March 1950, basically ending the situation of price fluctuations for many years. Secondly, after May, the People's Government began to adjust industry and commerce, improving the temporary sluggishness of commodities after price stabilization and the disappearance of false purchasing power, making national prices more stable.

Under the influence of the active market transactions after the autumn harvest and the US imperialists' launching of the war of aggression against Korea, some commodities such as yarn and cloth in various places once fluctuated in late October. However, because the People's Governments in various places quickly strengthened the supply of major commodities such as yarn and cloth, strengthened market management, and strictly banned certain commercial speculation activities, the above-mentioned local fluctuations of commodities such as yarn and cloth were quickly quelled, and national prices were further stabilized as a result.

　　中国现代史上空前重要大事之一
    全国物价一年来基本稳定
    【新华社三十一日讯】一九五○年三月份以来，全国物价基本稳定。这是中国现代史上空前重要的大事之一。
    根据北京、天津、上海、西安、重庆、广州等六大城市三十二种主要商品加权指数（以一九四九年十二月三十一日为基期：一百）统计：一九五○年十二月二十六日为一七六点七，比一年前上升仅百分之七十六点七，根本扭转了一九四九年一年内物价四次波动，上涨十九倍的趋势。
    中央人民政府为了稳定物价，一年来曾作了一系列的有效措施：首先是从一九五○年三月份起实施了全国财政经济工作的统一领导和统一管理，基本上结束了多年来物价波动的局面。其次，五月份以后，人民政府又开始调整工商业，改善了物价稳定和虚假购买力消失后的商品暂时滞销现象，使全国物价益趋稳定。
    在秋收后市场交易大为活跃以及美帝发动侵朝战争的影响下，各地纱布等部分商品曾在十月下旬一度发生波动。但由于各地人民政府迅即加强纱布等主要商品的供应，加强市场管理，严格取缔某些商业投机活动，上述纱布等商品的局部波动迅即平息，全国物价也因之被进一步地稳定下来。
