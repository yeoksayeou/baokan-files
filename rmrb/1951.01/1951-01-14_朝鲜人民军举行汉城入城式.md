　　Korean People's Army Holds Seoul Entry Ceremony
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th] Seoul News: After the Korean People's Army, fighting side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers, re-liberated the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Seoul, from the American invading army and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit army, a grand entry ceremony was held on the 9th of this month. Both sides of Seoul's Namdaemun Street were crowded with people from early morning. Workers, students, staff, women, and citizens held flags with slogans such as "Send the American invaders to their graves" and "Glory to the People's Army" and prepared to welcome their own army, from whom they had been separated for three months. The steel ranks of the People's Army, led by the military band, entered the city from Namdaemun amidst the solemn and majestic military music and the enthusiastic cheers of tens of thousands of citizens. Following the military band were the Zheng Zheryu detachment, tank units, mechanized units, and a steady stream of infantry, all of whom had contributed to the liberation of Seoul. The sturdy队伍队伍, passing through Taepeyong Street and Gwanghwamun Street, surged towards Hwanggeum Street. The "Central Hall," which had been used twice by the American invading army as a command post for the invasion of Korea, once again flew the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The citizens who lined the streets to welcome them shouted slogans such as "Long live the People's Army!" "Long live the People's Republic!" and "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" and threw countless colorful paper strips on the People's Army heroes. People's faces showed excitement. Having tasted the cruel massacres and persecutions of the American invading army and the Li Chengwan bandit army for more than three months, the people of Seoul, who had regained light and hope, shook hands with the People's Army heroes with infinite gratitude. At the intersection of Gwanghwamun Street, an old woman in her fifties or sixties squeezed into the ranks of the People's Army, grabbed a soldier's hand and trembled, saying, "You have come back. I want to accuse you, my children and daughters-in-law were all killed by the American devils." As the old woman spoke, she burst into tears. The People's Army heroes listened to the accusations of their dear compatriots with incomparable anger. They were determined to thoroughly eliminate the American and Li bandit armies and avenge the people. The heroes continued to advance, singing military songs with vigorous steps. More and more citizens followed behind the队伍. The people of Seoul were no longer willing to leave their ranks.
