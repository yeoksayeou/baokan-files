China People's Committee for World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression
Notice Regarding Organizing a Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to Express Sympathy

In order to express sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army who are bravely fighting against American aggression on the Korean front, we have now decided to organize a Chinese People's Delegation to go to Korea to express sympathy. The organizational methods are as follows:

(1) This committee will form a "General Delegation of the Chinese People's Delegation" with representatives from all circles in the capital and representatives from various regions coming to Beijing. Major administrative region branches and various organizations will form sub-delegations, each with approximately 50 people. Each region and major branch will invite representatives from various people's organizations and other aspects to jointly prepare and elect representatives and a number of staff members to form it. Each delegation will have a head, deputy head, and secretary-general for unified leadership.

In addition to conducting sympathy work for frontline commanders and fighters, the delegation will also practically collect materials about the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, the barbaric and brutal crimes of American imperialism, and their outwardly strong but inwardly weak and flustered state. After returning to China, they will systematically report to people of all strata to expand the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda work, further enhance the determination and confidence of the people across the country to oppose American aggression and defend world peace, and expand the patriotic movement of the people across the country.

(2) Each sub-delegation is requested to gather in Tianjin by February 10th in order to join the general delegation and go to Korea together. If the Northwest and Southwest regions are unable to arrive in time due to long distances, inconvenient transportation, and short time, they may consider sending fewer representatives and staff members.

(3) The comfort goods and letters of sympathy, books, and newspapers, etc., collected by local branches and intended to be carried by the delegation, are expected to be transported to Tianjin for centralized collection as much as possible before February 10th. The donated funds raised will be entrusted to the Trade Corporation by the General Association to uniformly purchase comfort goods and transport them.

(4) It is hoped that major administrative region branches will immediately invite local groups and relevant parties to prepare and report the preparation situation to this committee at any time.

　　中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    关于组织中国人民赴朝慰问团的通知
    为了慰问在朝鲜前线英勇作战反对美国侵略的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，我们现在决定组织中国人民慰问团前往朝鲜去慰问，其组织办法如下：
    （一）本会与首都各界及各地来京代表组成“中国人民慰问团总团”。各大行政区分会与各界组织慰问分团，每团人数以五十人左右为宜，由各地和大分会邀请各人民团体和其他各方面代表共同筹备，并推派代表和若干工作人员组成之。每团设团长、副团长、秘书长，以统一领导。
    慰问团除了对前线指战员进行慰问工作外，并将实际地搜集关于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军英勇作战的事迹和美帝国主义野蛮残暴的罪行及其外强中干手忙脚乱的材料，回国后向各阶层人民作系统报导，以扩大抗美援朝的宣传工作，进一步提高全国人民反对美国侵略保卫世界和平的决心和胜利信心，扩大全国人民的爱国主义运动。
    （二）各慰问分团请于二月十日到天津集中，以便与总团会合后一同赴朝，西北、西南如因路途遥远交通不便、时间短促来不及时，可自行斟酌少来一些代表和工作人员。
    （三）各地分会所募集的并拟由慰问团携带的慰劳品、和慰问信件、书报等，望尽可能于二月十号前运一部分到天津集中。所募集的捐款将由总会委托贸易公司统一购置慰劳品运去。
    （四）望各大行政区分会即邀请当地各团体及各有关方面进行筹备，并将筹备情形随时报告本会。
