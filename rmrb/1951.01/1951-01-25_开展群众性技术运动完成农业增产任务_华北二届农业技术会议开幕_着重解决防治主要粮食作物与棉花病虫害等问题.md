　　Launch Mass Technical Movement to Complete Agricultural Production Increase Tasks
    Second North China Agricultural Technology Conference Opens
    Focusing on Solving Problems Such as Prevention and Control of Major Grain Crops and Cotton Pests and Diseases
    [Report from this newspaper] The Second North China Agricultural Technology Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on January 23rd. Researching and promoting agricultural technology has become an urgent demand of the vast number of farmers in the old liberated areas of North China and is one of the main keys to completing the agricultural production increase plan. Over the past year, North China's provinces have achieved successes in promoting agricultural technology. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government invested 800,000 jin of rice to help farmers select superior wheat varieties. Hebei and Pingyuan provinces lent and distributed nearly 10 million jin of improved cotton seeds. In promoting seed soaking, seed mixing, and pest control, the five provinces collectively lent and sold 45,000 sprayers and more than 220,000 jin of various pesticides. In the first half of last year alone, Shanxi Province promoted improved varieties of miscellaneous grains on 300,000 mu and Si Zi cotton seeds on 92,000 mu in only 31 counties. Hebei promoted improved cotton on 850,000 mu. Last autumn, in some areas of Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi, mass appraisal movements were widely launched to select superior varieties. The seed soaking and mixing work carried out to prevent and control diseases and insect pests to ensure the healthy growth of seedlings reached 77% of the province's sown area in Shanxi alone. There are many examples of North China farmers' creations and inventions in improving agricultural technology. For example, Liu Jubao, a labor model and technical expert in Shanxi, selected and bred early North melons, early jade corn, and early-maturing rice varieties that matured half a month earlier than local varieties. Gao Guandou, a labor model in Dahu Jia Village, Hebei, improved 18 hectares out of 19 hectares of alkaline land in the entire village, increasing yields threefold. Farmers in Shanxi, Pingyuan, and other places have established small-scale farms to conduct various experiments in fertilization and cultivation. Many villages have established technical groups to study cultivation techniques according to the production season and improve cultivation methods. Summarizing mass experience and strengthening technical guidance to the masses has become one of the pressing tasks of the leadership.
    The main purpose of this conference is to summarize the experience of 1950 and study and arrange how to launch a mass technical movement in 1951 to ensure the completion of the agricultural production tasks for 1951. Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, pointed out in his opening speech: The national grain and cotton production increase plan for 1951 requires the production of 260 billion jin of grain, an increase of 6.1% over 1950, and the production of 19 million dan of cotton, an increase of 33.8% over 1950. Therefore, this conference takes agronomic crops (mainly grain crops and cotton) as the central topic and mainly solves the following problems: First, the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests should continue to implement the basic principle of "prevention is more important than cure." For example, improve cultivation methods, select disease-resistant and insect-resistant varieties, launch weed removal campaigns, collect insect egg masses, and carry out effective measures such as seed disinfection. In terms of pesticides and machinery, they should be systematically promoted by region and crop. In areas where conditions permit, vigorously develop effective domestic disease and insect pesticides. Second, the work of promoting improved varieties should mainly guide the mass seed selection movement and farm breeding and promotion. The principle should be to select seeds locally and promote them locally. The exchange of seeds should be mainly organized by the masses and the large-scale long-distance transportation of seeds should be reduced as much as possible. Third, in improving cultivation methods, in addition to continuing to advocate intensive farming, it is necessary to summarize mass experience well, grasp several major crops, and solve several major cultivation techniques. Fourth, farm work has made considerable achievements in the past year, but there are still many problems, especially regarding the farm work guidelines, tasks, and leadership relationships, which must be thoroughly discussed and studied and resolved in a timely manner to give play to the demonstrative role of farms in improving agricultural technology. In order to complete the above tasks, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational leadership of agricultural technology, summarize mass technical experience on the one hand, and promote scientific and technological knowledge on the other, and advocate technology "going to the countryside" to closely integrate technology with the masses, so as to create a mass technical movement.
    More than 220 people attended the conference, including cotton and grain personnel from the agricultural and forestry departments of the five provinces in North China, general farm headquarters, pest and disease control stations, special district farms, the North China Agricultural Science Institute, Beijing Agricultural University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and labor models who have made significant achievements in improving agricultural technology. The conference is expected to last ten days.

　　开展群众性技术运动完成农业增产任务
    华北二届农业技术会议开幕
    着重解决防治主要粮食作物与棉花病虫害等问题
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部、中央人民政府华北事务部联合召开的华北区第二届农业技术会议，已于一月二十三日在京开幕。研究推广农业技术，已成为目前华北老区广大农民的迫切要求，和完成农业增产计划的主要关键之一。去年一年来，华北各省在推广农业技术方面是有成绩的。山西省人民政府为扶助农民选择优种麦，投资即达八十万斤米。河北、平原两省曾贷发优良棉种近千万斤。在推行浸种、拌种、除虫中，五省共计贷售喷雾器四万五千架，各种农药二十二万余斤。山西省去年上半年仅三十一县即推广杂粮优种三十万亩，纯斯字棉种九万二千余亩。河北推广良棉八十五万亩。去年秋天，河北、平原、山西的某些地区，为了选拔优良品种，广泛地开展了群众性的评比运动。为防治病虫害保证禾苗成长良好而推行的浸种、拌种工作，仅山西即达全省播种面积的百分之七十七。华北农民在改良农业技术方面的创造和发明的例子是很多的，如山西劳动模范技术能手刘聚宝选育出早北瓜、早玉茭、早熟稻等品种较当地一般品种可早熟半月。河北大护驾庄劳动模范高贯斗，将全村十九顷碱地改良了十八顷，可提高产量三倍。山西、平原等地农民创立了小型农场，进行施肥耕作各种试验，许多村庄都建立了技术小组，按生产季节研究耕作技术，提高耕作方法。总结群众经验，加强对群众的技术指导，已成为领导上当前的迫切任务之一。
    这次会议的主要目的是总结一九五○年的经验，研究与布置一九五一年如何开展一个群众性的技术运动，以保证一九五一年农业生产任务的完成。中央人民政府农业部李书城部长在开幕词中指出：一九五一年全国粮棉增产计划要求生产粮食二千六百亿斤，较一九五○年增加百分之六·一，生产棉花一千九百万担，较一九五○年增加百分之三三·八。因此，这次会议以农艺作物（主要粮食作物与棉花）为中心议题，主要解决以下几个问题：一、防治病虫害工作，应继续贯彻“防重于治”的基本方针。如改良耕作方法，选择抗病抗虫品种，开展除草运动，采掘害虫卵块，进行种子消毒等有效措施。在药械方面，应有计划地分别地区、分别作物进行推广。并在条件具备的地区，大力发展有效的国产病虫农药。二、推广优良品种工作，主要是指导群众选种运动及农场繁殖推广。应以就地选种，就地推广为原则。调换种子，应以组织群众调换为主，并尽量减少远程大量调运种子。三、在改良耕作方法上，除应继续提倡精耕细作外，要很好的总结群众经验，抓住几种主要作物，解决几个主要耕作技术。四、在农场工作上，一年来已做出不少成绩，但也存在不少问题，特别是关于农场工作方针任务及领导关系都须要很好讨论研究，并求得及时解决，以发挥农场对于改进农业技术的示范作用。为了完成以上任务，必须加强农业技术组织领导工作，一面总结群众技术经验，一面推广科学技术，并提倡技术“下乡”使技术与群众密切结合，以造成群众性的技术运动。
    出席这次会议的有华北五省农林厅主办棉粮人员，各省农场总场、病虫害防治站、专署农场、华北农业科学研究所、北京农业大学、中国科学院以及在改良农业技术方面获有显著成绩的劳动模范等二百二十余人。会期预计为十天。
