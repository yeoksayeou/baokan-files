    Our Great Motherland
    The Yellow River originates in Qinghai, flows through the eight provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong, and empties into the Bohai Sea, with a length of more than 4,470 kilometers. The Yellow River basin is the homeland of our great ancestors. This is the famous and dangerous Yumenkou of the Yellow River, which is said to have been dug by Xia Yu more than 4,000 years ago.

    我们伟大的祖国
    黄河发源于青海，流经甘肃、宁夏、绥远、陕西、山西、河南、平原、山东八省，注入渤海，长达四千四百七十余公里。黄河流域是我们伟大祖先的故乡。这里是黄河著名险要禹门口，相传是四千多年前的夏禹所凿。
