Xinhua News Agency, dated 24th: Flood victims in the Huai River water disaster areas of Anhui and Henan have universally been clothed in the winter garments donated by compatriots from all walks of life across the country. As of mid-January, the Anhui North District Production and Disaster Relief Headquarters has distributed more than 3.14 million sets of winter clothing. These winter garments were allocated by the Beijing Winter Clothing Fundraising Headquarters and transported by the winter clothing fundraising branches of major cities. As soon as the winter garments arrived in Bengbu, the Anhui North District Production and Disaster Relief Headquarters immediately distributed them to various special districts and counties according to the severity of the disaster. Many cadres, in order for the victims to wear winter clothes as soon as possible, worked overnight to make forms, register, transport, and distribute them, until their eyes were bloodshot. The Anhui North District has approximately 10 million people affected by the disaster, of which about one-third, the severely affected victims, need winter clothing relief. Now, the majority have put on cotton-padded clothes. When the village distributed the winter clothing, the victims beamed with joy, and some were so moved that their eyes were filled with tears. An eighty-year-old woman in Meiying Village, Huaiyuan County, said with emotion when receiving her cotton-padded clothes, "I am so old, I have never seen such a good government!" The winter clothing has increased the victims' confidence in production and self-salvation, and has also promoted work such as harnessing the Huai River. The chairman of the Xiaqiao Village Farmers' Association in Sixian County said happily when he heard that the cotton-padded clothes were distributed, "That's great! The country takes such good care of us, we would really be letting Chairman Mao down if we didn't do our jobs well."
    As of the end of last year, the Henan Province Winter Clothing Disaster Relief Office received more than 720,000 sets of winter clothing and winter clothing monetary donations raised by various provinces and cities in the Central South District and various parts of the province. The office distributed them as soon as they were received, and they have all been distributed to the victims. When the victims heard that the winter clothes were all donated by compatriots from all over the country who tightened their belts and saved money, they generally expressed their gratitude, saying, "It's all thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership, and the people of the world are truly one family."

　　皖北河南灾民普遍穿上寒衣
    【新华社二十四日讯】皖北、河南淮河水灾区的灾民，已普遍穿上了全国各界同胞捐给他们的寒衣。截至本月中旬，皖北区生产救灾指挥部先后发下的寒衣，已有三百一十四万多套。这些寒衣都是由北京寒衣劝募总会拨发，由各大城市的寒衣劝募分会运去的。寒衣一到蚌埠，皖北区生产救灾指挥部就立即根据灾情轻重分发各专区各县。不少干部为了灾民能早日穿上寒衣，连夜造表登记、运送、分发，把眼睛都熬红了。皖北区轻重灾民约一千万人左右，其中需要寒衣救济的重灾民约三分之一。现在，大部都已穿上棉衣了。当村里发放寒衣的时候，灾民们笑逐颜开，有的感动得热泪满眶。怀远县梅营村一个八十多岁的老大娘在领棉衣的时候感动地说：“我这大年纪，从来没有见过这样的好政府啊！”寒衣提高了灾民们生产自救的信心，也推动了治淮等工作。宿县夏桥村农会主席听到棉衣发下来时，高兴地说：“可好了！国家这样照顾我们，若不干好工作真对不起毛主席。”
    河南省寒衣赈灾办事处截至去年年底，收到中南区各省市和本省各地劝募的寒衣和寒衣代金共计七十二万多套。该处随收随发，都已发到灾民手里了。灾民听说寒衣都是各地同胞节衣缩食捐出来的，普遍地感激说：“都是毛主席的领导好，天下老百姓真是一家人了。”
