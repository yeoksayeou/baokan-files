　　Xinhua News Agency Frontline Dispatch from Korea
    The Rout of US Troops on the Eastern Front in Korea	Nai Yin
    Following the path of the pursuit of the American invading army, this reporter inspected the eastern front battlefield from Liutanli, Xiajieyuli, Gutuli... to Hamhung. Here, various US military vehicles, Jeeps, and tanks with white star emblems were abandoned everywhere. Command trucks and ambulances were also overturned in roadside ditches or deeply mired in mud fields. About a dozen miles south of Xiajieyuli, two medium tanks and more than forty military trucks were parked. In the battle, the American bandits sitting in these vehicles did not have time to deploy, and were wiped out. Therefore, the tanks and trucks they transported still maintained an orderly formation. In Gutuli, three damaged tanks lay diagonally, the muzzles of the guns not facing north, but south, towards the direction from which they came. Not far from these three tanks, a sign was hanging on a utility pole, with a black spearhead pointing due north, and the distances to various places were marked below. However, the American bandits did not even have time to turn their "forward" spearhead around before desperately fleeing backwards.

    The further south we went, the more we saw the chaotic and embarrassed appearance of the enemy's escape. Blankets, military uniforms, tents, and "Arctic sleeping bags" were scattered along the road... everywhere. While crossing the Southeast Ridge, the reporter saw groups of military trucks lying diagonally on the mountain road, three of which were still loaded with the corpses of American soldiers. In the six bombed-out tanks, there were also the corpses of American tankers. The Chinese People's Volunteers' pursuing troops did not have time to clear the battlefield. They passed through these tanks and cars, and continued to chase the enemy non-stop.

    The further south, the more obvious the bloody crimes of the American bandits became. On the southeastern hillside, more than ten miles from Gutuli, lay eleven corpses of Korean people. The tanks and cars of the American bandits, desperate to escape, ran over these corpses, and the car tires imprinted dark red bloodstains on the pure white snow, a tragic scene beyond description. Another disaster created by the American bandits on the eastern front was the crazy bombing and burning. From Liutanli to Hamhung, not a single complete city or village can be seen. American planes dropped hundreds of incendiary bombs on the town of Gutuli, and the fire burned for a whole day and night. The Changjin Lake power plant was also bombed, and the huge machine buildings collapsed and were burned. The Chinese People's Volunteers, witnessing all the inhuman crimes of the American aggressors, gnashed their teeth and advanced courageously. The offensive of revenge is like a surging torrent, surging forward!

    朝鲜东线美军溃败情形	耐因
    沿着追击美国侵略军的道路，记者巡视了从柳潭里、下碣隅里、古土里……通向咸兴的东线战场。这里到处遗弃着有着白色星徽的各式美国军用汽车、吉普、坦克。指挥卡车和救护车也倾倒在路边水沟中，或深陷在泥田里。在下碣隅里南边十几里路的地方，停着两辆中型坦克和四十多辆军用卡车。在战斗中，坐在这些车上的美国强盗们来不及展开队形，就被消灭了，因此，他们运送来的坦克和卡车依然保持着齐整的队形。在古土里，有三辆被打坏了的坦克斜倒在那里，坦克上的炮口不是朝北，而是朝南，朝向他们的来路。在离这三辆坦克不远的地方，一根电线杆上挂着一块招牌，上面画着一个黑色的矛头指向正北，下面并记述着通向各地的里数。可是，美国强盗们，还没来得及把他们的这个“前进”矛头调转过来，就拚命地向后逃走了。
    愈向南走，就愈加看到敌人逃跑时的溃乱、狼狈的样子。抛在路旁的毛毯、军衣、帐篷、“北极暖袋”………到处都是。在翻越东南岭时，记者看到成群的军用卡车斜躺在山道旁，其中有三辆还载满着美国兵的尸体，在六辆被轰毁的坦克里，也有着美国坦克手的尸体。中国人民志愿军的追击部队来不及清扫战场，他们穿过这些坦克、汽车，不停地追赶敌人去了。
    愈往南，美国强盗们的血腥罪迹也愈加明显。在距古土里十余里的东南山坡上，躺着十一具朝鲜人民的尸体。美国强盗们夺路逃命的坦克、汽车从这些尸体上辗过，汽车轮胎把赤黑的血迹印到洁白的雪地上，惨状难以目睹。美国强盗们，在东线制造的另一灾难是疯狂的轰炸和焚烧。从柳潭里到咸兴一线，已经看不到一处完整的城市和村落。美国飞机曾在古土里镇投下上百枚的燃烧弹，大火延烧一昼夜。长津湖发电厂也被轰炸，巨大的机器楼房塌倒焚毁。中国人民志愿军战士们，目睹美国侵略者这种种丧尽人性的罪行，个个咬牙切齿，奋勇前进。复仇的攻势，像澎湃的激流，汹涌向前！
