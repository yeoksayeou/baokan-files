　　Several Must-Be-Corrected Points in the Revised Edition of Fan's "Modern Chinese History"
　　Rong Mengyuan

　　The first volume of the upper section of Comrade Fan Wenlan's "Modern Chinese History" was published by the Xinhua Bookstore in Yan'an in February 1947 (in two volumes). Later, the editions printed by the Xinhua Bookstores in Jin-Cha-Ji, Shandong, and Northeast China were all based on the original Yan'an edition. In the autumn of 1947, there were minor revisions. This revised edition was first printed by the North China Xinhua Bookstore and later printed by the Reading and Life Publishing House in Hong Kong under the name "Wu Bo." The edition later printed by Sanlian Bookstore was also this revised edition. In 1949, Comrade Fan Wenlan revised it again, and it was published simultaneously by North China University and Beijing Xinhua Bookstore. The edition printed by North China University had many typos and was not for sale. Now, the best edition should be the revised edition of November 1949 by Beijing Xinhua Bookstore.

　　However, the revised edition is not perfect. The following are some of the more important shortcomings and errors that have been discovered and must be corrected:

　　1. In Chinese and Western records, the Hui people in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and eastern Xinjiang have often been referred to as "Donggan Hui" or "Donggan people." In fact, the sound "Donggan" is a slander against the Hui people. In the past, the meaning of "Donggan" was unknown, and the term was used. Now that it has been pointed out by Hui comrades, it must be corrected.

　　2. Because the book relies on books such as "A Brief Account of Military Affairs in the East" (written by Yao Xiguang) and "Sixty Years of China and Japan" (compiled by Wang Yunsheng) to discuss the anti-Japanese war in Taiwan during the Sino-Japanese War, "Jian Jinghua" and "Jian Dadu" are mistaken for one person, "Jian Jinghua" which is "Jian Yi" is mistaken for two people, "Dapingding" is mistaken for "Taipingding," "Citong Lane" is mistaken for "Citong Port," "Ke Tie," who resisted at Dapingding, is mistaken for "Jian Yi," and the statement that "one-tenth" of the Taiwanese residents were indigenous people during the Sino-French War is mistaken for "six-tenths." There are many errors, and now that Taiwanese comrades have pointed them out, they must also be corrected.

　　3. Hong Rengan co-founded the God-Worshipping Society with Hong Xiuquan. After arriving in Nanjing in 1859, he proposed progressive ideas for building the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, such as building railways, opening factories, freedom of speech, and rewarding new inventions. He was one of the brilliant leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but he was not valued by Hong Xiuquan (he was valued when he first arrived in Nanjing, but removed from important positions in 1862). Before revising "Modern Chinese History," Comrade Fan Wenlan had not seen documents such as "Zizheng Xinbian" and "Hong Rengan's Autobiography," which led to an underestimation of Hong Rengan, saying that he, Hong Renfa, Hong Renda and others "were all greedy, vile, and did nothing but harmful and destructive things to the Heavenly Kingdom." This must also be corrected.

　　4. Some of the wording in the book is not clear enough, and even contains errors. For example, Feng Yunshan died at Suoyi Ferry in Quanzhou. The book says "Suoyi Ferry between Quanzhou and Yongzhou" (page 125), which makes the reader wonder whether Suoyi Ferry is in Quanzhou or Yongzhou. Li Hongzhang transported troops to Yashan on one British ship and two Chinese ships. The book says "British merchant ship Gaosheng and three other ships" (page 309), as if all three were British ships. Detring was German, but the book mistakenly identifies him as British (page 332). Yuqian was a Mongol of the Bordered Yellow Banner, but the book mistakenly identifies him as Manchu. All of these need to be corrected.

　　5. There are also many printing errors in the book, for example:

　　Page Number　　Line Number　　　　Error　　　　　　　　　Correction
　　98　　　　　　7　　　　　　　Diligent Solicit Fees　　　Extort Fees
　　146　　　　　14　　　　　　　　Mine,　　　　　　　　Sulfur,
　　255　　　　　9　　　　　　　　Guo Songtao　　　　　　Guo Songtao
　　263　　　　　13　　　　　　1890　　　　　　　　1870
　　299　　　　　11　　　　　Unit: Millions of Dollars　　Unit: Ten Thousands of Dollars
　　498　　　　　2　　　　More than Four Million Taels, Four Million Taels, The remaining amount
                                         Only sufficient to cover old foreign debt Only sufficient to cover the old foreign debt

　　In addition, there are many more important shortcomings, and Comrade Fan Wenlan plans to correct them all in the reprint. He also hopes that readers will offer more opinions to help him make corrections. As for the differences between the revised edition and the original edition or the 1947 revised edition, I wrote "Reading Comrade Fan's Revised Edition of Modern Chinese History" in the People's Daily on December 14, 1949, and I will not repeat it here.

　　Some readers have also pointed out the different evaluations of Li Xiucheng in the Reading and Life edition (i.e., the 1947 revised edition) and the revised edition, which also needs to be explained.

　　"Li Xiucheng's Autobiography" is the main basis for evaluating Li Xiucheng, and we should start with the versions of "Li Xiucheng's Autobiography." The original manuscript of "Li Xiucheng's Autobiography" was hidden by Zeng Guofan. The "Li Xiucheng's Confession" carved by Zeng Guofan was tampered with, and it is now very difficult to find. The Beijing University photolithographic edition of 1936 is also not widely circulated. The most common version is the "Secret History of Modern China" version, which was deleted and revised based on Zeng's carved edition. Zuo Shunsheng's edited "Supplementary Compilation of Historical Materials of China in the Past 100 Years" is based on Zuo's edited version and slightly modified (whether it was modified by Zuo Shunsheng is unknown). Yang Song and Deng Liqun's edited "Reference Materials for Modern Chinese History" is based on Zuo's edited version, and some typos occurred during printing. The edition recorded in Luo Yong et al.'s "Anthology of Poetry and Prose of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," in addition to deleting and revising Zeng's carved edition, also added many things arbitrarily. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, a book called "Anthology of Poetry and Prose of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," which was heavily discounted, was reprinted based on Luo Yong's book, and the errors were naturally more numerous than Luo's edition. There are many other versions, so I won't go into detail here. When Comrade Fan Wenlan wrote the book in Yan'an, he could only see Yang and Deng's edited version, Zuo's edited version, and the heavily discounted version. The original edition of Fan's book was based on these to comment on Li Xiucheng. In 1949, Comrade Fan Wenlan came to Beijing and saw the photolithographic edition of Zeng's carved edition and a small portion of the original manuscript's photos and transcripts. Since the original manuscript was different from the common version and also different from Zeng's carved edition, all arguments should be based on the original manuscript. The revised edition's evaluation of Li Xiucheng is based on the photos of the "original manuscript," while other places are based on Zeng's carved edition (because the entire original manuscript had not yet been seen at that time). Now that "Annotations to the Original Manuscript of the Autobiography of Zhong Wang Li Xiucheng" has been published, Fan's "Modern Chinese History" will probably need to be re-revised based on the entire "original manuscript."

　　In short, there are many versions of Fan's "Modern Chinese History." Today, the better version is the 1949 revised edition. From now on, "Li Xiucheng's Autobiography" should be based on the "original manuscript" and not on other versions.

　　范著《中国近代史》订正本中几个必须改正的地方
    荣孟源
    范文澜同志著的《中国近代史》上编第一分册，一九四七年二月在延安新华书店出版（为上下二册）。后来晋察冀、山东与东北新华书店所印的，都是根据延安初版本。一九四七年秋小有修改，这个修改本先由华北新华书店印行，后在香港读书生活出版社用“武波”名义印出，后来三联书店所印的，也就是这个修改本。一九四九年范文澜同志又订正了一次，由华北大学与北京新华书店同时出版。华北大学所印错字多，也不出卖。现在说来，最好的版本当是一九四九年十一月北京新华书店的订正本。
    然而订正本并非尽善尽美，就现在所发现的缺点和错误，比较重要的已有如下数条，必须改正，如：
    一、向来中西文记载，多称陕、甘、宁、青与新疆东部的回族为“东干回”或“东干族”。其实“东干”这个声音，是污蔑回族的。过去不知“东干”的意义，沿用了这个词，今由回族同志指出，是必须改正的。
    二、因为根据《东方兵事纪略》（姚锡光著）与《六十年中国与日本》（王芸生辑）等书来谈甲午战争时台湾抗日战争，遂把“简精华”和“简大肚”误为一个人，把“简精华”即“简义”误为两个人，把“大坪顶”误为“太平顶”，把“刺桐巷”误为“刺桐港”，把据大坪顶抗日的“柯铁”误为“简义”，把中法战争时台湾居民番族“占十分之一”误为“占十分之六”。错误很多，今由台湾同志指出，也是必须改正的。
    三、洪仁玕与洪秀全同创上帝教，一八五九年他到达南京以后，提出修铁道、开工厂、言论自由、奖励新发明等进步的建设太平天国的意见，他是太平天国的英明领袖之一，可是他未被洪秀全重用（初到南京时被重用，一八六二年撤去重要职务）。在订正《中国近代史》以前，范文澜同志并未见到《资政新篇》，《洪仁玕自述》等文献，以致把洪仁玕估价过低，说他和洪仁发、洪仁达等“都是贪鄙龌龊，专做危害天国恶事的破坏者”。这也是必须改正的。
    四、书中有些措词不够清楚，甚至发生了错误。如冯云山死在全州蓑衣渡，书中说“全州永州间的蓑衣渡”（页一二五），使读者疑问蓑衣渡到底在全州还是在永州。李鸿章运兵到牙山本是一只英国船，两只中国船，书中说“英国商轮高升等三船”（页三○九）、好象三只都是英国船。德璀琳本是德国人，书误为英国人（页三三二），裕谦本是蒙古镶黄旗人，书中误为满洲人。都是须要改正的。
    五、书中排印错误也很多，例如：
　　页数　　　　行数　　　　　　误　　　　　　　正　　
　　九八　　　　　七　　　　　　勤索规费　　　　勒索规费 　一四六　　　　一四　　　　　　　　矿，　　　　　　磺、
　二五五　　　　　九　　　　　　　郭松焘　　　　　郭嵩焘
　二六三　　　　一三　　　　　一八九○年　　　　一八七○年
　二九九　　　　一一　　　　单位百万美元　　　单位万美元
　四九八　　　　　二　　　　四百万两余款，四百万两，余款
                            仅敷旧外债抵偿　仅敷抵偿旧外债
    此外还有许多更重要的缺点，范文澜同志准备都于再版时改正。他还希望读者多提出意见，帮助他改正。至于订正本与初版本或一九四七年修改本有何不同，我曾在一九四九年十二月十四日人民日报上写过“读范著中国近代史订正本”，不再重复了。
    还有些读者指出读书生活本（即一九四七年修改本）与订正本，对李秀成的评价不同的问题，这也是需要加以解释的。
    《李秀成自传》是对于李秀成评价的主要根据，应先从《李秀成自传》的版本说起。《李秀成自传》原稿被曾国藩隐藏起来了。曾国藩所刻的《李秀成供》是经过窜改的，而且此书早已很难看见，一九三六年北京大学影印本，流传也不广。最常见的版本是《近世中国秘史》本，那是根据曾刻本又删改过的。左舜生辑《中国近百年史资料续编》，即根据《近世中国秘史》本又略有改动（是否左舜生所改尚不知）。杨松、邓力群两同志辑《中国近代史参考材料》，系根据左辑本而在排印中又发生了些错字。罗邕等编《太平天国诗文钞》所录本，除去删改曾刻本以外，又妄增了许多。抗日战争以前，一时盛行一折八扣的书，又据罗邕书改头换面地印了一本《太平天国诗文钞》，错误当然比罗印本更多。其他版本尚多，不必再赘述了。范文澜同志在延安写书时，只能见到杨、邓辑本，左辑本、与一折八扣本，范书初版本就是根据它来评论李秀成的。一九四九年范文澜同志来到北京，看到了影印的曾刻本，和一小部分原稿的照片与抄录。原稿既与通行本不同，与曾刻本也不同，于是一切论据自当以原稿为凭。订正本对李秀成的评价根据“原稿”照片，其他地方引用者是根据曾刻本（因当时原稿尚未全部见到）。现在《忠王李秀成自传原稿笺证》既已印行，今后范著《中国近代史》恐还须要重新根据全部“原稿”订正。
    总之，范著《中国近代史》版本很多，今天比较好的版本是一九四九年订正本。《李秀成自传》从现在起，应以“原稿”为据，不应再根据其他版本。
