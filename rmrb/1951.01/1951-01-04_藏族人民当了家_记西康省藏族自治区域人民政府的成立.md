Tibetan People Become Masters of Their Own House
    — On the Establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government of Xikang Province
    Xian Pin, Shen Shi

    November 24th was an epoch-making day in Tibetan history, a day most worthy of commemoration for the Tibetan people.

    On this day, the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government of Xikang Province was formally established. After being slaughtered and enslaved by the reactionary feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang bandit gangs, the Tibetan people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, cast off the heavy shackles of thousands of years. On the land stained with the blood of their ancestors, their own government appeared for the first time. They truly became masters of their own house.

    On November 25th, the people were so delighted that the streets were plastered with slogans, cartoons, and wall newspapers, and red flags fluttered throughout the autonomous region. On this day, 5,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life held a celebration of the establishment of their own government and a rally to resist America and aid Korea. The venue was surrounded by Five-Star Red Flags, and the platform was covered with flags presented by people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life. The flags were inscribed in the languages of various ethnic groups—Tibetan, Hui, Han, and Yi—symbolizing the unity of the people of all ethnic groups. The 5,000 people, dressed in various costumes and speaking the languages of their own ethnic groups, made the venue extraordinarily lively.

    At the celebration rally, a large crowd squeezed onto the rostrum, vying to present hadas to the chairman of their own government—Sangji Yexi. Hundreds of hadas, the hearts of tens of thousands of people, were eagerly presented, aiming to build a brand-new paradise on the desolate plateau.

    In front of thousands of attendees, Chairman Sangji Yexi spoke, calling on all ethnic groups to unite under the banner of the great leader Chairman Mao to build the autonomous region and oppose the aggression of American imperialism. Jia Ri Nima, a representative from Zhanhua County, said: "We must know who gave us today's fruits. Without the Central People's Government, without the Chinese Communist Party, without Chairman Mao, could we have our own government? We must resolutely defend our fruits. When drinking water, don't forget the well-digger. We will not forget Chairman Mao's wise leadership, and we Tibetan people will cherish the fruits we have obtained like our own lives. We will spread the fruits so that the vast mountains and fields on both sides of the Dadu River and the Jinsha River will be covered with blooming flowers!"

    After the meeting, a parade was held. The magnificent procession passed through every street in the city, enthusiastically shouting slogans such as "Support Foreign Minister Zhou's just statement to the United Nations!", "Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country!", and "Celebrate the Establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government!" Residents crowded the streets, shouting slogans together. All ethnic groups truly gained liberation today, and feelings of joy and anger were intertwined.

    The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province includes the 20 counties east of the Jinsha River and west of Luding: Kangding, Luding, Yajiang, Qianning, Danba, Jiulong, Lihua, Daocheng, Dingxiang, Derong, Yidun, Ba'an, Daofu, Ganzi, Dege, Dengke, Shiqu, Baiyu, Zhanhua, and Luhuo, as well as the Ngolok area in northern Kang. It has a total population of over 700,000, of which Tibetans account for more than four-fifths, and the remainder are Han, Yi, and Hui people. The lineup of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government is as follows:

    Chairman Sangji Yexi, who grew up in Dangba, Xikang, is a fighter who was tempered by the Long March with the Red Army in 1935. Over the past fifteen years, under the cultivation of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, he has become an educated person. Today, he puts on the clothing of his own ethnic group and returns to his hometown to do good things for his people.

    Vice Chairman Xia Ke Daodeng has a fifteen-year friendship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army and is a very active supporter of the advance into Tibet. Vice Chairman Miao Fengshu is the Secretary of the Kangding Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. He is humble, amiable, simple, pragmatic, and faithfully implements the Party's policies, and is loved by the Tibetan, Hui, Han, and Yi people. Vice Chairman Awang Jiacuo once served as Khenpo of the Yila Monastery in Tibet. Vice Chairman Losang Qingba is the Khenpo of the Litang Lama Temple in southern Kang and enjoys prestige among the lamas on the southern route of Xikang.

    Among the 28 government members who were temporarily appointed with the approval of Premier Zhou of the Central People's Government's State Council, 20 are Tibetan, 1 are Hui, and 1 is Yi. They come from the 20 counties in the Kangding area, including Tusi, headmen, Living Buddhas, and lamas.

    The counties and districts under this government will establish county and district people's governments according to the ethnic composition of the population, whether they are living in concentrated or mixed communities. The departments, institutes, and people's governments at all levels under its jurisdiction will employ a large number of cadres from various ethnic groups.

    These facts and the work to be carried out demonstrate that the establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government of Xikang Province has truly realized the regional autonomy of ethnic groups stipulated in Article 51 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    The delegates attending the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, in accordance with the specific conditions in the Kangding area, after repeated research and discussion, adopted a draft of the working tasks of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government and a covenant of unity among the people of all ethnic groups. It stipulates that in the future, in military affairs, we should actively support the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet, thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gangs, and stabilize social order; in politics, we should strengthen the unity among all ethnic groups, establish a new relationship of equality, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups, and prohibit mutual discrimination, oppression, fighting, and vendettas. Disputes existing between and within ethnic groups should be resolved through mediation and consultation. In terms of economy, it is stipulated that agricultural and pastoral production and industries such as fur should be developed. In terms of culture and education, it is stipulated that ethnic cultural heritage should be protected, ethnic colleges should be established, primary and secondary schools should be restored and rectified, Tibetan newspapers and textbooks should be published, and medical and health undertakings should be developed to protect the health of the people of all ethnic groups.

    From the Qing Dynasty to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, a corvée system prevailed in the Kang-Tibetan area. The Tibetan people called this corvée system "Ula." There were many types of "Ula," including cattle Ula, horse Ula, firewood Ula, grass Ula, soup Ula (for tea), dayi (managing private mules and horses), nayi (serving as errands to fetch things), kaiyi (serving as messengers to convey calls), and renyi (providing women for overnight companionship). If a reactionary ruler, from officials to soldiers, needed an "Ula," they would send eight or ten people to extort property. The Tibetan people could not bear the suffering and constantly fled. After liberation, the People's Liberation Army and the staff of the People's Government implemented public buying and selling and did not take a single needle or thread from the people, which greatly moved the people of all classes in Tibet. In order to respect the demands of the broad masses of Tibetan people and eradicate the long-standing corvée system that they hated, the draft of the working tasks stipulated the abolition of the "Ula" system and the implementation of a reasonable service burden.

    Every item of the working tasks of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government is in accordance with the requirements of the Tibetan, Han, Yi, and Hui people, and every item is for their long-term welfare. As the Riku Living Buddha of Tagong Monastery in Kangding and Zengque Zha, a representative from Batang County, said: This draft of the working tasks considers all aspects comprehensively and fully meets the interests of the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life. The delegates attending the meeting have the responsibility to earnestly, practically, and resolutely implement this draft.

    The establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government of Xikang Province is a concrete realization of the correct ethnic policies of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Chinese Communist Party. It is a great achievement of the unity and struggle of the military and civilians in the entire Tibetan area. In the future, under the leadership of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the region will strive to build a new Tibetan area.

　　藏族人民当了家
    ——记西康省藏族自治区域人民政府的成立
    贤品 沈石
    十一月二十四日，是藏族史上一个划时代的日子，是藏族人民最值得纪念的日子。
    这一天，西康省藏族自治区域人民政府正式成立了。经过反动封建皇朝和国民党匪帮的屠杀奴役，藏族人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，摆脱了千百年来沉重的枷锁，在染遍了他们祖先鲜血的大地上，第一次出现了他们自己的政府。他们真正当了家。
    十一月二十五日，人们是这样的欢欣，街头上贴满了标语、漫画和壁报，红旗飘扬在全自治区域。这一日，各族各界有五千人举行了庆祝自己的政府成立和抗美援朝大会。会场四周插满五星国旗，礼台上挂满了各族各界人民的献旗，旗上写着各族——藏、回、汉、彝族的文字，它象征了各族人民的团结。五千人穿着各种不同的服装，愉快地说着本民族的语言，使会场分外的热闹。
    在庆祝大会上，一大群人，挤上主席台，争着向他们自己政府的主席—桑吉悦希—献哈达，几百条哈达，成万人的心，争相献出来，要在荒冷的高原上，建设崭新的乐园。
    当着数千与会群众，桑吉悦希主席讲话，他号召各族站在伟大领袖毛主席旗帜下，团结起来，建设自治区域，反对美帝国主义的侵略。瞻化县代表甲日尼马讲话说：我们要知道，今天的果实是谁给我们的，没有中央人民政府，没有中国共产党，没有毛主席，我们能够有我们自己的政府吗？我们要坚决保卫我们的果实。吃水不忘掘井人，我们忘不了毛主席的英明领导，我们藏族人民会爱护已经获得的果实像爱护自己生命一样，我们要将果实散播出去，让大渡河、金沙江两岸广阔的山野，开遍朵朵鲜花！
    会后举行游行。雄壮的行列经过城内的每一条大街，热烈地高呼着“拥护周外长对联合国的正义声明！”“抗美援朝保家卫国！”“庆祝藏族自治区域人民政府成立！”的口号。居民们拥塞街头，一同高呼口号，各族人民今天真正获得解放了，欢快和愤怒的情绪交织着。
    西康藏族自治区包括金沙江以东，泸定以西的康定、泸定、雅江、乾宁、丹巴、九龙、理化、稻城、定乡、德荣、义敦、巴安、道孚、甘孜、德格、邓柯、石渠、白玉、瞻化、炉霍等二十县，以及康北之俄洛地区。共有人口七十余万，其中藏族占五分之四强，余为汉、彝、回各民族的人民。藏族自治区域人民政府的阵容是这样的：
    主席桑吉悦希，生长在西康党坝，他是一九三五年随着红军长征饱经锻炼的斗士，十五年来，在毛主席和中国共产党的培植下，成为有教养的人。今天，他穿起他本民族的服装，回到他的家乡，要为他本族人民办好事情。
    副主席夏克刀登，和中国人民解放军有着十五年的友情，他是支援进军西藏很积极的一位。副主席苗逢澍，中国共产党康定地委会书记，他，谦虚、和蔼、朴实、实事求是，忠实地执行了党的政策，受到藏、回、汉、彝各族人民的爱戴。副主席阿旺嘉错，曾任西藏邑拉寺堪布，副主席洛桑倾巴，康南理塘喇嘛寺堪布，在西康南路喇嘛中享有威望。
    经中央人民政府政务院周总理批准暂行就职的二十八名政府委员中，藏族二十人，回族一人，彝族一人。他们来自康定地区的二十个县，其中有土司、头人、活佛和喇嘛。
    这一政府所属各县、区，即将依照民族聚居或杂居情况，分别建立县、区人民政府。它所属各处、院及各级人民政府，将大量地任用各民族干部。
    这些事实和即将进行的工作，说明西康省藏族自治区域人民政府的产生，名符其实地实现了政协共同纲领民族政策第五十一条所规定的民族的区域自治。
    出席西康省藏族自治区域第一届各界人民代表会议的全体代表，按照康定地区具体情况，经过反复研究讨论，通过藏族自治区域人民政府各项工作任务草案和各民族人民的团结公约。规定今后在军事方面应积极支援人民解放军进军西藏，彻底肃清帝国主义与国民党匪帮的残余势力，安定社会秩序；在政治上应加强各民族间的团结，建立各族人民平等互助友爱合作的新关系，禁止互相歧视、压迫、械斗及打冤家等行为，对各民族间和民族内部存在的纠纷，采用调解协商方式来解决。在经济方面规定应发展农牧业及毛皮等工业生产。在文化教育方面，则规定保护民族文化遗产，创办民族学院，恢复和整顿中、小学校，出版藏文报纸和课本，并发展医药卫生事业，保护各民族人民身体健康。
    从满清到国民党反动统治时期，康藏地区盛行着一种差徭制度，这种差徭制度，藏族人民叫它做“乌拉”，“乌拉”名目繁多，有牛差、马差、柴差、草差、汤差（供茶水）、打役（管理私人骡马）、拿役（服奔走取物等差役）、开役（服传达呼唤等差役）、人役（供给妇女伴宿）。反动统治者上至官员，下至士兵差人，如果需要一个“乌拉”，即派八个或十个，借以勒索财物。藏族人民不堪其苦，致不断逃亡。解放后，人民解放军和人民政府工作人员，实行公买公卖、不拿人民一针一线，大大地感动了藏族各阶层人民。为了尊重广大藏族人民的要求及根绝他们所痛恶的相沿已久的差徭制度，工作任务草案规定了废除“乌拉”制度，实行合理的勤务负担。
    藏族自治区域人民政府的各项工作任务，每一项都是遵照藏、汉、彝、回族人民的要求，每项都是为了他们的长远福利。正如康定塔公寺日库活佛和巴塘县代表曾却扎等所说的：这个工作任务草案，对各方面都想得周周到到，完全符合各族各界人民的利益，出席会议的代表均有责任将这个草案认真切实坚决地予以贯彻执行。
    西康省藏族自治区域人民政府的成立，是毛主席、中央人民政府和中国共产党正确的民族政策具体的实现。是全藏区军民团结奋斗的伟大成果。今后该区藏、汉、彝、回族各界人民，在藏族自治区域人民政府领导下，定将为建设新藏区而努力奋斗。
