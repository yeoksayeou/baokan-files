　　Letters of invading Korean troops
    MacArthur ordered inspection
    Any expressing "dissatisfaction" would be destroyed
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch] According to a Manila dispatch from the Electric Communication Agency: General MacArthur's General Staff in Tokyo is carrying out strict inspections not only of news reports concerning the situation in Korea, but also of the letters of officers and soldiers of all troops fighting in Korea. According to a secret order from MacArthur, the correspondence of officers and soldiers on the front lines in Korea is now subject to official inspection in Japan. With the assistance of translators in all the languages used by the soldiers, American inspectors carefully examine each letter. All letters expressing "dangerous opinions and attitudes" are destroyed in accordance with MacArthur's orders.
    Manila sources familiar with the reasons and nature of MacArthur's measures from the US military authorities revealed to the Electric Communication Agency reporter: This step was taken because an investigation showed that many letters sent to soldiers fighting in Korea from the United Kingdom, Australia, the Philippines, Turkey, and other countries taught them the best ways to fake various diseases to avoid fighting on the front lines. At the same time, most of the letters sent home by soldiers contained expressions of dissatisfaction, revealing so-called "military secrets." According to American investigators, this phenomenon is occurring on a "large scale."
    According to another order from MacArthur, a network of spies has been expanded within the "United Nations forces," and these spies are responsible for reporting the "dangerous opinions" of American and all other foreign officers and soldiers to the US high command.

　　侵朝军队官兵信件
    麦克阿瑟下令检查
    有表示“不满”的就予销毁
    【新华社十三日讯】据电通社马尼拉讯：麦克阿瑟将军在东京的总参谋部不仅对于有关朝鲜情况的新闻报道，而且对于在朝鲜作战的所有军队的官兵的信件，都实行严格的检查。根据麦克阿瑟的一道密令，朝鲜前线的官兵们的来往信件，现在都在日本受官方检查。美国检查员在士兵们所使用的所有语文的译员们的协助下，仔细地检查每一封信件。凡是表露“危险意见与态度”的信件，都根据麦克阿瑟的命令予以销毁。
    从美国军事当局方面获悉麦克阿瑟采取这种措施的原因和性质的马尼拉人士向电通社记者透露：这一步骤之所以采取，是因为一种调查显示：许多封自英国、澳大利亚、菲律宾、土耳其和其他国家寄给在朝鲜作战士兵的信件，都教给他们以伪装各种疾病以避免在前线作战的最妙的办法。同时，士兵们寄回家的大部信件中都包含着不满的表示，泄露所谓“军事机密情况”。据美国调查人员发觉，这种现象正在“大规模地”发生着。
    根据麦克阿瑟的另一道命令，“联合国军队”中间已经在扩大组织特务网，这些特务人员负责向美国高级指挥部报告美国和其他一切外国官兵的“危险意见”。
