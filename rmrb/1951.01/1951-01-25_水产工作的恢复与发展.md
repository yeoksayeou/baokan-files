　　The Restoration and Development of Aquatic Work
    Gao Shuyi
    Before the War of Resistance, China's aquatic product output reached 1.5 million tons. Due to the long-term destruction by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the output decreased year by year, falling to 450,000 tons by 1949. After the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the implementation of the economic policy stipulated in the Common Program of "protecting coastal fishing grounds and developing the aquatic industry," the national aquatic industry gradually recovered and developed. In February 1950, the Central People's Government convened the First National Aquatic Conference, allocating production tasks to various regions and provinces. The national target was 736,000 tons, and by the end of 1950, it had been successfully overfulfilled, reaching 910,000 tons, 124 percent of the original plan. This not only solved the livelihoods of more than 1.2 million fishermen (equivalent to enough grain to feed 4.5 million people for a year), but also increased the country's income.
    The overfulfillment of production in 1950 was primarily due to the establishment of aquatic administrative agencies in various regions and provinces, providing leadership for aquatic administration. On the enterprise side, there were three state-owned aquatic companies in Guandong, Shandong, and Shanghai. Fish markets were established in coastal and inland lake cities of national importance. In particular, aquatic product transportation and sales companies were created to systematically solve the difficulties in transporting and selling aquatic products. Local aquatic administrative agencies assisted fishermen in establishing fishing cooperatives, fishermen's associations, and fishermen's labor unions. Through these organizations, the government's fisheries production policies were implemented, loans were issued, fishing gear was repaired, fishing salt was allocated, fishing supplies were provided, and large quantities of fishermen's products were purchased for processing, transportation, and sales. Relying on this series of effective measures, production was rapidly increased.
    However, at present, due to the short history of state-owned enterprises, their productivity is still very weak, and mass production is also in the initial stages of organization. Production in most areas is still in a free-flowing state, and the production base is not yet stable. In particular, the American imperialists and the Chiang bandits are shamelessly harassing our coast, directly affecting our fisheries production. Therefore, aquatic work in 1951 is an arduous and important task.
    In the past year of aquatic work, the following two practical issues were realized: First, more than 90 percent of all production is completed by individual fishermen, while new-style fisheries production accounts for less than 10 percent. This is a current characteristic of China's aquatic industry. Based on this fact, it should be recognized that it is not possible to quickly adopt mechanized enterprise management for all fisheries in China at present. Therefore, the main key to improving production at present is not simply to develop state-owned enterprises, but mainly to "vigorously support mass production," organize fishermen, and guide them towards cooperative economy. State-owned enterprises can only strengthen their operations and accumulate capital on the existing basis to gradually improve and grow.
    Second, transportation and sales have affected production. This is mainly because new aquatic product transportation and sales organizations have not been universally established, while the old fish markets have serious intermediate exploitation, increasing costs and hindering sales. Secondly, there is not enough refrigeration equipment and sufficient transportation capacity. Therefore, during the peak fishing season, fish products cannot be quickly transported away from the production area, and the market price cannot be properly controlled. For example, last year the price of prawns produced in Yangjiaogou, Shandong, was only 400 yuan per pair, but at the same time, they were sold for 2,000 yuan in Qingdao and 4,000 to 5,000 yuan in Shanghai, a difference of up to ten times, affecting the fishermen's production enthusiasm.
    In the past year's experience, it was deeply felt that the difficulties in transportation and sales were greater than the difficulties in production. If we do not open up a path from fish product transportation and sales work, the production base will not be easily stabilized. Fish is a commodity produced by fishermen, not for the producers' own consumption. This is a point of distinction from agricultural production. Its high seasonality and its fresh state are its greatest characteristics among commodities. If the transportation and sales business is entirely operated by private merchants, they can easily seize this weakness of the producers, manipulate market conditions, and arbitrarily suppress prices and exploit them, causing losses to the producers. Therefore, in addition to supporting mass production and strengthening the tasks of state-owned production, we must also grasp and organize transportation and sales work well, increase state-owned aquatic product markets, systematically establish transportation and sales organizations, and reduce intermediate exploitation that hinders fisheries production. Organize a transportation and sales network, with a central agency as the hub, to centrally plan and decentralize operations. In this way, we can avoid blind transportation that results from each acting on its own and avoid undue losses. State-owned aquatic enterprises should lead private enterprises and take into account the relationship between public and private sectors.
    In order to welcome this year's spring fishing season and large-scale production, we need to study and understand these issues more deeply so as to properly handle the work and consolidate the foundation of the people's aquatic industry.

　　水产工作的恢复与发展
    高树颐
    抗战以前我国水产品产量曾达一五○万吨，由于日寇及蒋介石匪帮的长期破坏，产量逐年减低，至一九四九年降至四十五万吨。中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立，执行了共同纲领所规定的“保护沿海渔场，发展水产业”的经济政策，全国水产事业，才逐渐恢复与发展。一九五○年二月中央人民政府曾召开第一次全国水产会议，分配了各区各省的生产任务，全国共计七十三万六千吨，至一九五○年底，已胜利超额完成了九十一万吨，为原定计划的百分一百二十四。不但解决了一百二十余万渔民的生活（折成粮食足供四百五十万人的全年生活），并且增加了国家的收入。
    一九五○年的生产超额完成，首先是全国各区、省的水产行政机构建立，水产行政有了领导。在企业方面有了关东、山东、上海三个国营水产公司。在全国沿海及内地滨湖重要城市建立了鱼市场，特别创建了水产运销公司，有计划地解决了水产运销困难。各地水产行政机构，协助渔民建立了渔业合作社与渔民协会、渔工会。通过这些组织，贯彻了政府的渔业生产政策，发放贷款，修理渔具，配售渔盐，供应渔需品，并大批收购了渔民的产品进行加工运销。依靠这一系列的有效措施，使生产迅速提高。
    但是，目前的渔业生产，因为国营企业历史很短，生产力还是非常微弱，而群众生产也在初步进行组织，大部地区生产仍处于自流状态，生产基础还不够稳固，尤其美帝及蒋匪正在无耻地骚扰我沿海，使我们的渔业生产直接受到影响，因而一九五一年水产工作，乃是一项艰苦的重要任务。
    在去年一年的水产工作中，体会到下列两个实际问题：第一、是全部生产由个体渔民所完成的占百分之九十以上，而新式渔业生产则不足百分之十，这是我国水产业目前的一个特点。根据这一事实，应该认识到我国全部渔业目前还不可能很快地采取机械化的企业经营，因而目前提高生产的主要关键，不能单纯是发展国营企业，而主要地是“大力扶持群众生产”，组织渔民，引导他们走向合作经济。国营企业也只有从现有基础上，加强经营，积累资本，才能逐步提高壮大。
    第二是运销影响了生产。这主要是因为新的水产运销机构没有普遍建立，而旧的鱼行存在严重的中间剥削，增加成本，障碍推销；其次是没有足够的冷藏设备和充分的运输力量，因而当旺汛期间，鱼产不能迅速运离产地，便不能适当地掌握市场价格。例如去年山东羊角沟所产对虾每对价仅四百元，但同时青岛要卖到二千元，上海四、五千元，相差竟至十倍，影响了渔民生产情绪。
    在去年一年的经验中，深深感到运销工作上的困难大于生产上的困难，我们不从鱼产运销工作打开出路，生产基础便不容易稳定。鱼类是渔民生产的商品，而不是为了生产者自己食用，这是区别于农业生产的一点，它的高度季节性以及它所具有的生鲜状态，是它在商品中最大的特点。如果全由私商经营运销业务，便极易被他们抓住生产者的这一弱点，操纵行情，任意压价剥削，使生产者受到损失。因此，我们要在扶持群众生产，加强国营生产的任务之外，必须很好掌握与组织运销工作，增加国营水产市场，有系统地建立运销组织，减除妨害渔业生产的中间剥削。组织运销联络网，并由中心机构作为枢纽，集中筹划，分散经营，如此，可以避免各自为政的盲目运输，而招致不应有的损失。国营水产企业要领导私营，并照顾到公私关系。
    为了迎接本年的春汛大生产，需要我们对这些问题加以更深刻地研究与了解，以便适当地处理工作，巩固人民水产业的基础。
