　　U.S. "Strategic Services Unit" Espionage Activities in China
　　Xiao Hang
　　The espionage nature of the U.S. "Strategic Services Unit" (SSU) was so blatant that the American public adopted the popular term for spies, "cloak and dagger," as its specific nickname. It was established in 1942, reorganized from the Information Bureau established in July 1941. Its full name was the "Strategic Intelligence Bureau" (O.S.S.), and its leaders were a small group of reactionary figures from Wall Street. The director, Donovan, was a director of the World Chamber of Commerce, associated with the Mellon financial group. He had previously traveled to Abyssinia, the Middle East, and various American countries to collect intelligence. In July 1941, Roosevelt established the Information Bureau and appointed him as its director. After becoming the director of the "Strategic Services Unit," he assigned important positions within the "Strategic Services Unit" to the fascist Colonel Becks Dong, the chairman of the large export trading company Richard, the war-monger Churchill's cousin Gerst, the son of the lead magnate Mellon, and the White Russian general and prince Obolensky from the Tsarist era.
　　As soon as the "Strategic Services Unit" was established, it sent a large number of spies to various countries to collect intelligence, paying particular attention to collecting intelligence on the Soviet Union. Many of these spies were sent out under the guise of journalists. However, the "Strategic Services Unit" spies who came to China openly wore "O.S.S." armbands.
　　The espionage activities of the "Strategic Services Unit" in China can be roughly divided into three stages: The first stage was from the entry of U.S. troops into Kunming until the Japanese surrender, using the guise of "joint anti-Japanese operations and Sino-American intelligence exchange," establishing general branches in Kunming, Chongqing, Xi'an, and other places. The Xi'an general branch also established an advance command post in Huayin. The Chinese headquarters of the "Strategic Services Unit" was located in Kunming, attached to the U.S. Army Headquarters in China. The second stage was from the Japanese surrender until 1948, when the Northeast was about to be completely liberated. Originally, the United States had announced the dissolution of the "Strategic Services Unit" in 1945, but in reality, the espionage activities of the "Strategic Services Unit" in China continued until now. It was only after the Japanese surrender that certain changes were made in the mode of operation, using the guise of "repatriating Japanese prisoners and residents," and the general branches in Kunming, Chongqing, Xi'an, and other places were abolished, with only a few personnel remaining to continue working locally. Most of the personnel went to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Beiping, the Northeast, Zhengzhou, and other places, establishing new espionage agencies. At that time, because U.S. troops had withdrawn from China, the "Strategic Services Unit" headquarters in China moved to Shanghai; and because the U.S. Navy had a special operations cooperation agreement with the Kuomintang bandit gang, the "Strategic Services Unit" headquarters in China changed its name to "Naval Fourth Fourth Foreign Affairs Observation Team" (E.S.D), around late 1947 and early 1948. The third stage is from the liberation of the Northeast and major cities such as Tianjin to the present, with all activities going underground.
　　Regardless of how much the operational methods of the "Strategic Services Unit" changed, its conspiracy remained the same. All intelligence gathering was preparing for annexing Korea, invading China, and attacking the Soviet Union.
　　Over the years, the U.S. "Strategic Services Unit" has, through various relationships, including those with Japanese who had previously occupied various parts of China, conducted reconnaissance of the military, political, and economic conditions in various provinces of China. They paid close attention to local weather information, such as the rainy season, snowfall time, etc., which was for the air force. They believed that China was experiencing a severe food shortage and conducted surveys of grain production in various provinces to understand how many troops each province could supply. All of this information was repeatedly "verified." The focus of these intelligence activities of the "Strategic Services Unit" was in the Northeast. This was because, according to their understanding, first, the Northeast was the industrial heart of China; second, a large number of weapons from the Japanese Kwantung Army had been seized by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Therefore, they not only established the "Strategic Services Unit" Northeast General Branch, but the Beiping General Branch also established intelligence groups in Changchun and Dalian. At the same time, the Shanghai headquarters directly sent agents to the Northeast for reconnaissance. The espionage activities of the "Strategic Services Unit" in the Northeast were divided into two regions, North Manchuria with Harbin as the center, and South Manchuria with Dalian as the center, mainly collecting reports on military facilities and industrial equipment.
　　There is this fact: Qi Lan, an espionage element of the U.S. "Strategic Services Unit" in China, in February 1946, together with Huang Tianmai, the secretary of Zheng Jiemin, came to the Astor House Hotel in Tianjin to meet Wen Qiang. Wen Qiang was an old KMT secret agent, in 1942 he was the director of the KMT’s North China Office, and in 1946 he was the director of the investigation office of the puppet Manchurian government, then the Lieutenant General Director of the Second Department of the puppet Manchurian Xingyuan and the Director of the Supervisory Office. The reason why Qi Lan wanted to see Wen Qiang was not a "friendly" visit, but to ask Wen Qiang to tell Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming to protect a group of agents he sent to the Northeast. He said that these were a group of reporters who were going to the Northeast for on-the-spot investigations. What these so-called "reporters" were "investigating on the spot" was, in addition to the situation of our side in the Northeast, the situation of the Soviet army.
　　Coming to China to reconnoiter the situation of the Soviet Union was one of the main activities of the U.S. "Strategic Services Unit." According to Annabelle Bucar, an intelligence officer who defected from the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union in 1948, "'Strategic Services Unit' personnel stationed in Chongqing collected information about the Soviet Union. In 1942, a specialized official of the 'Strategic Services Unit,' namely I. Tolstoy, was sent to Tibet to study the situation in areas near the Soviet border, and at the same time, to organize anti-Soviet intelligence activities in these areas." After the Japanese surrender, "Strategic Services Unit" spies went everywhere to collect documents from the Japanese Kwantung Army regarding the situation of the Soviet Union and obtained maps of Soviet military facilities along the Northeast border. Its agents stationed in the Northeast conducted reconnaissance of the strength and equipment of the Soviet army in Lushun and Dalian, as well as airports, etc.
　　The U.S. imperialists' delusion of annexing Korea is not something that exists only today. The attack on the Korean people by the Syngman Rhee puppet on June 25, 1950, was arranged by the American invaders years earlier. Before the Soviet army withdrew from North Korea, "Strategic Services Unit" agents investigated the activities of the Soviet army in North Korea. In the summer of 1946, the "Strategic Services Unit" established an investigation station in Yanji, Northeast China, specifically to collect information on North Korea. Naturally, the conspiratorial activities of the American invaders against North Korea were not limited to collecting intelligence. They had long ago trained a group of Korean traitors.
　　It was in May 1945, when an American major named Watson met with Hu Zongnan, the commander of the KMT's First War Zone at the Small Wild Goose Pagoda KMT First War Zone Headquarters in Xi'an. Watson wore an "O.S.S." armband and was an agent of the "Strategic Services Unit." He asked Hu Zongnan to allocate a house for him in Weiqu, thirty miles away from Xi'an, to be used for running a short-term training class. He said that the trainees were not Chinese, but the "Korean First Volunteer Army" led by Li Fan-shih. Wen Qiang, a KMT secret agent, was present at the time.
　　This short-term training class was presided over by Li Fan-shih, and the instructors were American agents. There were about two hundred trainees in total, and all expenses were provided by the United States. Li Fan-shih, a notorious Korean traitor and American spy, was the former "Prime Minister" and "Minister of National Defense" of the Syngman Rhee puppet government. At that time, he explained to Wen Qiang the purpose of running the short-term training class, which was to "rely on the United States to fight back to Korea." In fact, as early as 1945, the United States had allocated a batch of light weapons and some funds to Li Fan-shih. As soon as Li Fan-shih returned to Korea, he established a secret service agency in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, trained a group of spies for the U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency" (C.I.C), and planned and concluded treasonous treaties such as the "Korean-American Economic Agreement" and the "Korean-American Military Agreement." He was an active participant in the U.S. imperialists' launching of the war of aggression against Korea.
　　These facts are easy to understand. Long ago, the United States dreamed of following Japan's old path: annexing Korea, invading China, and dominating the world. The U.S. "Strategic Services Unit" attempted to pave this self-destructive path with espionage activities, but its criminal activities have already been met with a fierce hammer blow from the Chinese people. The "Strategic Services Unit" underground agency in Beiping has been uprooted by us.
　　The Beiping General Branch of the "Strategic Services Unit" was established on August 17, 1945, located at No. 38, Liutiao, Dongsi Avenue, and the person in charge was Major Forman. In early November of that year, Forman met Xiong Xianli, a former lecturer at the Sino-French University and a traitorous consul, at a tea party at the Beijing Hotel. Soon, with the approval of the "Strategic Services Unit" headquarters in Washington, Xiong Xianli was hired as a consultant with a monthly salary of US$100. In late July 1946, Xiong Xianli accompanied Beiping "Strategic Services Unit" agent Baisike to Shenyang and Changchun to hold a meeting with local American "Strategic Services Unit" agent leaders Sha Lefu and Li Jiasheng, deciding to establish intelligence work in the Northeast. After returning to Ping in mid-August, Xiong Xianli introduced his wife's younger brother Yu Kegang (a reconnaissance member of the Shenyang working team of the puppet Ministry of National Defense's Second Department, a graduate of the telecommunications personnel training class) and Zhang Jie to participate in American espionage activities. In October, Yu Kegang used his classmates' relationship to introduce Song Tingqing, the radio station chief of the Dalian espionage group of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, to join the group, using the radio station of the puppet Ministry of National Defense to send intelligence to Xiong Xianli. The American agents immediately appointed Song Tingqing as the leader of the Dalian intelligence group. In December, Song Tingqing introduced his classmate Bao Yi (the radio station chief of the 91st espionage group of the Second Department of the puppet Ministry of National Defense) to join the group. The American agents then appointed Bao Yi as the leader of the Changchun intelligence group. These two intelligence groups launched activities in November and December, communicating with Beiping and being directly led by Xiong Xianli.
　　In May 1948, estimating that Pingjin was about to be liberated, the American agents withdrew the long-public Beiping General Branch and established a radio station at Xiong Xianli's home to contact American agents in Qingdao, Changchun, Shanghai, and other places. In October, Ma Zi, the liaison officer of the "Strategic Services Unit" Shanghai headquarters, and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Oshen came to Ping. Oshen trained Yu Kegang and others to master new communication technologies. On October 17, Changchun was liberated, and on November 2, Shenyang was liberated. Xiong Xianli stopped contacting the Northeast. Soon, Ma Zi telegraphed Xiong Xianli from Shanghai, ordering him to prepare to go underground and to place two small transceivers in reliable locations. At the same time, he ordered Xiong Xianli to send reliable personnel to Taiwan to learn the latest advanced communication technology. However, not long after Beiping was liberated, Xiong Xianli's criminal activities were exposed, and he and his partners Yu Kegang and others were all arrested by the People's Public Security organs.
　　The American imperialists, this sinister and vicious enemy, was our "ally" during the years of World War II. However, it was precisely at that time, precisely by using this guise, that it launched large-scale espionage and sabotage activities in our country, arranging plans to annex Korea, invade our country, and dominate the world. The espionage activities of the "Strategic Services Unit" in China are only a part of the espionage activities of the United States in China.

　　美国“战略局”在中国的特务活动
    萧航
    美国“战略局”的特务性质是如此的露骨，以至使美国公众把“斗篷和短刀”这一对间谍的流行称呼，当作了它的特有绰号。它成立于一九四二年，是一九四一年七月设立的情报局改组的。全名是“战略情报局”（Ｏ·Ｓ·Ｓ），领导人员是华尔街的一小撮反动分子。局长杜诺万，是与梅隆财阀有关系的世界商会的董事。早年即曾到阿比西尼亚、中东及美洲各国收集情报。一九四一年七月，罗斯福设情报局，即任局长。他在做了“战略局”局长之后，就把“战略局”的重要职位给了法西斯的贝克斯冬上校、大出口贸易行的董事长李察、战争贩子邱吉尔的表弟格斯特、铅业大王梅隆的儿子，还有沙俄时代的白卫将军、亲王奥波伦斯基。
    “战略局”刚一成立，就派了大批特务到各国收集情报，特别注意收集苏联的情报。这些特务，许多是以记者的名义派出去的。不过来到中国的“战略局”特务，却曾公然戴着“Ｏ·Ｓ·Ｓ”的臂章。
    “战略局”在中国的特务活动，大致可分三个阶段：第一阶段是从美军进入昆明到日本投降以前，以“联合对日作战，中美交换情报”作幌子，在昆明、重庆、西安等地设立了总支部，西安的总支部并在华阴设立了前进指挥所。“战略局”的中国总部设在昆明，附属于驻中国的美国陆军总部。第二阶段自日本投降以后到一九四八年东北即将全部解放。本来，一九四五年美国即已宣布撤销“战略局”，实际上，“战略局”在中国的特务活动一直继续到现在。只是在日本投降以后，活动方式上作了某些改变，改用了“遣送日俘、日侨返国”的幌子，并将昆明、重庆、西安等地的总支部撤销，只留少数人员继续在当地工作，大部分人员分赴上海、广州、青岛、北平、东北、郑州等地，设立了新的特务机构。那时，因美军已自中国撤退，“战略局”在中国的总局遂移往上海；并因美国海军方面与国民党匪帮有特工合作协定，“战略局”在中国的总部遂易名为“海军第四十四外事观察队”（Ｅ·Ｓ·Ｄ），时为一九四七年末一九四八年初。第三阶段是从东北及平津各大城市解放到现在，全部活动转入秘密。
    不论“战略局”的活动方式有了多少改变，它的阴谋始终是一样的，一切情报的搜集，全是给并吞朝鲜、侵略中国、进攻苏联作准备。
    几年来，美国“战略局”通过各种关系，其中也通过曾在中国各地盘踞过的日本人，对中国各省的军事、政治、经济各方面情况作了侦察。他们十分注意各地的气象情报，如雨季、降雪时间等等，那是给空军准备的。他们认为中国粮食奇缺，曾对各省的粮食产量作了调查，以了解各省能够供应多少军队。这些情报，全是经过再三“查对”的。“战略局”的这些特务情报活动，重点是在东北。这是因为：按照他们的了解，第一，东北是中国的工业心脏；第二，日本关东军有一大批武器为中国人民解放军所缴获。因此，他们不仅建立了“战略局”东北总支部，而且北平的总支部也在长春、大连设立了情报分组。同时，上海总部还直接派特务到东北侦察。“战略局”在东北的特务活动，分为两个地区，北满以哈尔滨为中心，南满以大连为中心，主要是搜集军事设施以及工业设备的报情。
    有这样一个事实：美国“战略局”在中国的特务分子齐兰，曾于一九四六年二月，偕同郑介民的秘书黄天迈，到天津利顺德饭店来会文强。文强是军统老特务，一九四二年任军统华北办事处主任，一九四六年任东北伪长官部调查室主任，继任伪东北行辕第二处中将处长及督导室主任。齐兰之所以要见文强，并不是什么“友谊”拜会，而是要文强转告熊式辉和杜聿明，对他派到东北去的一批特务加以保护。他说，这是一批记者，要到东北作实地考察。这批所谓“记者”，其所“实地考察”者，除了东北我方的情况之外，就是苏军的情况。
    经过中国来侦察苏联的情况，这是美国“战略局”的主要活动之一。据一九四八年脱离驻苏美大使馆的情报人员安娜贝尔·布卡尔说：“‘战略局’派驻重庆的人员，曾搜集了有关苏联的情报。一九四二年，‘战略局’的一个专门官员，即Ｉ·托尔斯泰，被派到西藏去，研究靠近苏联边境诸区域的情况，同时，在这些地区组织反苏的情报活动。”在日本投降以后，“战略局”特务曾到处搜集日寇关东军的有关苏联情况的文件，并获得了苏联沿东北边境的军事设施地图。其派驻东北的特务，对旅大苏军的兵力、装备以及机场等等作了侦察。
    美帝国主义并吞朝鲜的妄想，不是今天才有的。一九五○年六月二十五日李承晚傀儡向朝鲜人民的进攻，远在几年以前就由美国侵略者布置好了。苏军撤离北朝鲜之前，“战略局”的特务曾对苏军在北朝鲜的活动进行了调查。一九四六年夏，“战略局”就在东北延吉设立了调查站，专门收集北朝鲜的情报。自然，美国侵略者对北朝鲜的阴谋活动，并没有局限于搜集情报一项，它老早就训练了一批朝鲜奸细。
    那是一九四五年的五月，有一个名叫华生的美国少校，在西安小雁塔国民党第一战区长官部，会见了当时的国民党司令长官胡匪宗南。华生戴着“Ｏ·Ｓ·Ｓ”的臂章，是“战略局”的特务。他要胡匪宗南在距西安三十华里的苇曲，拨一处房子给他，作为开办短期训练班之用。他说，训练的对象不是中国人，而是李范奭率领的“韩国第一义勇队”。当时在场的有军统特务文强。
    这个短期训练班是由李范奭主持的，教官是美国特务，共有二百左右的学员，费用全由美国供给。李范奭，这是一个著名的朝奸和美国间谍，是前任李承晚傀儡政府的“国务总理”兼“国防部长官”。当时，他曾向文强解释了开办短期训练班的目的，为的是“依靠美国，打回朝鲜去”。事实上，就在一九四五年，美国已经拨给李范奭一批轻武器和一部分资财了。李范奭一回到朝鲜，就在京畿道的水原，设立了特务机关，给美国“中央谍报局”（Ｃ·Ｉ·Ｃ）培养了一批特务，并且策划与缔结了“韩美经济协定”、“韩美军事协定”等卖国条约。他是美帝国主义者发动侵朝战争的积极参与者。
    这些事实是容易理解的，很早以前，美国就梦想着走日本的老路：并吞朝鲜，侵占中国，独霸世界。美国“战略局”曾企图用特务活动来铺平这条自取毁灭的道路，但是，它的罪恶活动，已经受到中国人民的猛力锤击。美国“战略局”在北平的潜伏机关已经被我们连根拔除了。
    “战略局”北平总支部成立于一九四五年八月十七日，设东四大街六条三十八号，负责人是福尔曼少校。当年十一月初，在北京饭店的茶会上，福尔曼认识了前中法大学讲师、汉奸随习领事熊先立。不久即经“战略局”华盛顿总部批准，聘熊先立为顾问，月薪美金一百元。一九四六年七月下旬，熊先立随北平“战略局”特务白赛克赴沈阳、长春，与当地美国“战略局”特务头子沙乐夫、李嘉胜举行会议，决定建立东北情报工作。八月中旬回平后，熊先立介绍其妻弟俞克刚（伪国防部二厅沈阳工作队侦测员，电讯人员训练班毕业）及张杰参加美国的特务活动。十月，俞克刚利用同学关系，介绍伪国防部大连谍报组电台台长宋廷卿入伙，利用伪国防部的电台，给熊先立发情报。美特当即任命宋廷卿为大连情报分组组长。十二月，宋廷卿又介绍他的同学鲍义（伪国防部二厅第九十一谍报组电台台长）入伙。美特遂任命鲍义为长春情报分组组长。这两个情报组于十一、二月先后展开活动，与北平通报，统归熊先立直接领导。
    一九四八年五月，估计到平津即将解放，美特乃将公开已久的北平总支部撤退，在熊先立家中设立了电台，与青岛、长春、上海等地美特联络。十月间，“战略局”上海总部联络官美特马滋偕美海军上尉欧申来平，由欧申训练俞克刚等掌握新的通讯技术。十月十七日长春解放，十一月二日沈阳解放，熊先立与东北停止联络。不久，马滋自沪电熊先立，命其准备潜伏，把两个小型的收发报机分设于可靠地点。同时，命熊先立派可靠人员到台湾学习最新式的高等通讯技术。但是，北平解放不久，熊先立的罪恶活动即已暴露，连同他的伙伴俞克刚等全被人民公安机关捕获。
    美帝国主义者，这个阴险而凶恶的敌人，在第二次世界大战的年月里，它曾是我们的“盟国”，然而，正是在那时，正是利用了这个幌子，在我国展开了大规模的特务破坏活动，安排下并吞朝鲜，侵略我国，独霸世界的计划，“战略局”在中国的特务活动，还仅仅是美国在中国的特务活动的一个部分而已。
