　　The Glorious Sacrifice of Volunteer Stretcher-Bearer Old Man Tian
    Shi Benchu
    Tian Fushan was from the Fifth District of Muling County, Songjiang Province, and was already fifty-three years old. If you just chatted with him about the days before liberation, he would tell you a series of things more bitter than bile. He often said, "For so many years, in the days of oppression by the Japanese devils and the puppet Manchukuo, we lived like dogs." After the victory against Japan, Old Man Tian fully expected to live a good life, but the Kuomintang reactionaries came to the Northeast again. Whenever the Kuomintang reactionaries were mentioned, he would point to the scars from being beaten for not being able to pay the "conscription money" while talking. After liberation, Old Man Tian's eyes were filled with brightness: food, clothing, and even his grandson was getting married... Old Man Tian was truly happy beyond words.
    In recent months, he had constantly heard news about the American devils learning from the Japanese devils and invading Korea and our motherland, and he felt very uncomfortable in his heart. Thinking of the past, looking at the present, when he heard that volunteer soldiers were going to fight the American devils, he inquired everywhere, wanting to join. One day, many young men in his village volunteered to go to Korea to carry stretchers, and he spent several sleepless nights discussing it with them. Everyone advised him not to go because of his age, but he was always unconvinced. In the end, he secretly shaved his beard clean at home and went to discuss it again. Everyone still advised him, but this time he got really angry, "Don't you all think you're young and strong, even though I'm old, I can still do the work of one person. Let anyone who doesn't believe me wrestle with me!" Everyone had no choice but to let him go to Korea together.
    His face couldn't hide his age, and after more than a month of walking from his hometown to the Yalu River, his beard had grown back. After crossing the river, on the steep cliffs and winding mountain roads in North Korea, in the bitterly cold and snowy climate, the ice frozen on Old Man Tian's beard and eyelashes, like rolling beads, formed a white layer of frost. However, at night in the torrent of the volunteer stretcher team, he was the one who worked the most. Whether walking or resting, in addition to completing his own work, he also helped others pull sleds and do other chores. Once, just after dawn, the team stopped to rest in a small gully. The young people, who had walked all night, fell asleep as soon as they lay down; afraid that others would freeze their feet, he secretly stuffed the sedge grass he had brought into the shoes of the person next to him; he covered others with the luggage he had brought. When leaving, an old Korean man, touching Old Man Tian's beard, gave a thumbs up and said, "Very, very good!" His eyes were filled with grateful tears. Although he couldn't understand the language, the behavior of such an old man volunteering to aid Korea deeply moved his heart.
    To take care of him, the stretcher detachment asked him to come to the team headquarters to feed the horses. But in the current situation in Korea, feeding the horses was also relatively difficult, and fodder was not always available. Old Man Tian thought about the horses day and night. Once, when the horses had no grass, he tried to overcome the difficulties and picked up the scattered firewood at the entrance of the cave to feed the horses. Comrades asked him to go eat, and he said, "The horses still have to pull things, what are people busy with if the horses aren't fed, I'll eat after the horses are full." That's how he cared about his work.
    On the night of December 6th, the team set off again. Tian Fushan prepared the horses. This time, there was a lot of stuff to pull, and many important things were loaded on them. He carefully pulled the reins and advanced in the dark night. Just as the team reached Changjin, enemy planes flew over from the opposite mountain and dropped bombs as they crossed the mountain. At this time, Old Man Tian thought, if he loosened the reins, the horses would run away in fright, and with a mountain stream on one side and high mountains on the other, and people in front and behind, letting the enemy planes discover the target would cause great losses. With a spirit of self-sacrifice, he decided to hold the reins tightly. Under the relentless bombing of the heinous enemy planes, Old Man Tian was seriously injured. After the enemy planes left, everyone went to him. He was still breathing, and the detachment leader held his hand. He said a few words intermittently: "Don't worry about me, it's right to sacrifice for the people, hurry up and advance, complete our task." After saying that, he died. In the end, everyone buried his body, wiped away their tears, and raised their fists to swear to avenge Tian Fushan!
    The team advanced again, Tian Fushan's hot blood was spilled on the land of Korea, and Tian Fushan's spirit lives in the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people.

　　光荣牺牲的志愿担架队员田老汉
    师本初
    田富山是松江省穆陵县第五区人，年纪已经五十三岁了。你随便和他扯一下解放以前的日子，他便会告诉你一连串比黄连还苦的事情。他常说：“多少年来，在日本鬼子和伪满压迫的岁月里，咱就像狗一样过活。”抗日胜利后，老汉满想着要过好日子，但是国民党反动派又到了东北。一提起国民党反动派，他就会一边说一边指着因缴不起“壮丁钱”而被打的伤疤。解放后，老汉眼前眼后都充满了光明：吃的、穿的、又加上孙孙要娶媳妇……，老汉真乐得不知怎样是好。
    最近几个月来，他不断地听到美国鬼子学着日本鬼子侵略朝鲜和祖国的消息，他心眼里很不舒服。想着以往的，看看现在的，听说有志愿兵去打美国鬼子，他就到处打听，要去参加。一天，他屯子里有许多年青小伙子志愿到朝鲜去抬担架，他几夜没有睡觉的和人家商量。大伙劝他，年纪大，别去了，他老是不服气。最后他回家偷着把胡须刮得光光的，还去商量。大伙仍然劝他，但是这一回他真恼了，“你们大伙别觉得年轻有力，我虽然年纪大，干起活来同样能顶一个。谁来和我摔摔跤看！”大伙没办法，就让他一道到朝鲜了。
    脸面掩盖不住年纪老，从家乡到鸭绿江边一个多月的行路，胡须又长满了。渡过江以后，在陡岩峭壁、迂回曲折的朝北山道上，在严寒刺骨、风雪遍地的气候里，老汉的胡须和睫毛上冻的冰，像滚珠一样，凝成的霜，白白的一层。但是，夜间在志愿担架队的洪流里，他是干活顶多的一个。不论是走路或是住下，他除了把自己的工作完成以外，还帮助人家拉雪橇和干别的活。有一次天刚亮，队伍住下了，在一个小山沟里休息。年青人走了一夜的路，一躺便睡着了；他怕别人冻着脚，便把自己带的乌拉草偷偷地塞在他旁边的人的鞋子里；把自己带的行李盖在别人的身上。临走时，一位朝鲜老大爷，手摸着老汉的胡子，大拇指一伸说：“大大的好！”眼睛里含着感激的泪水。虽说不通言语，但是这样大年纪的老汉志愿援朝的行为，深深地感动了他的心。
    担架支队为了照顾他，叫他到队部来喂马。但是在朝鲜现在这种情况之下，喂马也比较困难，草料不是经常的有，老汉昼夜为马着想。有一回马没有草了，他就想法克服困难，把零散在山洞门口的柴草拾起来喂马。同志们要他去吃饭，他说：“马还要拉东西，马吃不饱，人忙什么，等马吃饱了，我再吃。”他就是这样关心着自己的工作。
    十二月六日夜晚，队伍又出发了，田老汉准备好了马匹，这一次拉的东西真不少，许多重要的东西都装在上边，他谨慎地拉起了马缰，在漆黑的夜里前进。大队刚走到长津，敌机从对面的山头上飞过来，越过山头就扔炸弹。这时，老汉想，要是松开了马缰，马会惊跑起来，在一边是山涧，一边是高山，前后又都是人群的情况下，让敌机发现目标会受很大的损失。他以自我牺牲的精神，决定紧握住马缰。在万恶的敌机轮番轰炸下，老汉负了重伤。敌机走后，大家到他跟前，他还有呼吸，支队长握住他的手，他断断续续地说了几句话：“你们不要管我，为人民牺牲是应当的，你们赶快前进吧，完成咱们的任务。”说完了话，气就绝了。最后大家掩埋了他的尸体，擦干了眼泪，举起了拳头宣誓，要为田老汉报仇！
    队伍又前进了，田老汉的热血洒在朝鲜的土地上，田老汉的精神活在中朝人民的心上。
