On the Eastern Front in Korea
　　By Our Correspondent Lin Wei
            I. Hand-to-Hand Combat in Ice and Snow
　　In mid-November, when the vanguard of the American army scurried to the Changjin Lake area in northern Korea, and foolishly clamored to rush to the Yalu River, an American war correspondent said, "I always feel like someone is staring at them." This statement was not wrong. At that time, they were indeed being "stared at" by the eyes and gun muzzles radiating hatred from all directions.
　　People and people's armies unwilling to be enslaved, regardless of the enemy's day and night bombing, enduring the severe cold of minus twenty or thirty degrees, along the high mountains and ridges of Changjin Lake, climbed over snow-covered jungles and ditches, against the direction of the enemy's advance, quietly and rapidly deployed densely around the enemy's front, rear, left, and right, gradually enclosing the enemy in huge pockets. On November 27, tens of thousands of American troops were divided and surrounded in three circles: Hagaru-ri, Yudam-ni, and Sinhung-ri. The people's soldiers dug foxholes in the iron-hard frozen ground, closely monitoring the surrounded enemy. They studied various attack maneuvers and coordination plans, vowing to wipe out this group of barbaric invaders, to avenge the hundreds of thousands of innocent peaceful people of Korea who had been killed, and to ensure that the peaceful people of China would no longer suffer slaughter.
　　On the night of November 27, the bugle for the charge sounded, and the people's soldiers climbed through the ice and snow, clinging to branches and firewood, quietly and quickly approaching the enemy. Many important hills and positions immediately saw the start of hand-to-hand combat.
　　The enemy, unaware that their fate was sealed, initially resisted stubbornly. However, no amount of the enemy's concentrated firepower could hinder the will of our People's Volunteer soldiers to attack. In the rain of bullets, charge, and charge again! To seize an enemy hill, sometimes it was necessary to charge three or four times in a row. To hold a captured hill, sometimes it was necessary to repel the enemy's counterattacks four or five times in a row. Before the enemy's complete defeat on December 4 and 5, this kind of position battle continued for six or seven days. But, in any case, the final victory of each battle always belonged to the people's soldiers. The world-renowned heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, almost every company achieved a victorious conclusion at every step, completing the tasks they were assigned.
　　One company was ordered to attack and capture a hill urgently needed to be captured during the day. Despite the enemy planes diving down to the treetops to continuously strafe and bomb everywhere, despite the dense fire of the enemy's automatic weapons on the hill, the people's soldiers slid down and climbed up the snow slopes, advancing valiantly, wave upon wave, and finally planted the red flag on the hilltop.
　　The enemy originally thought that their tanks could save their lives. When they counterattacked our captured positions, or attempted to break out and escape, they always put a large number of tanks in front. The People's Volunteer Army did not have tanks, and anti-tank weapons were also lacking, but the soldiers did not cower in front of the tanks. They relied only on grenades and explosives, on courage and wisdom, and still conquered many tanks, blowing up the enemy's tanks, and making them unable to move.
　　The enemy's cars were naturally even more useless in front of the people's soldiers and were blown up and destroyed many more times than the tanks. When the enemies from the damaged vehicles tried to jump out of the cars to escape, it was even easier for them to be hit by the People's soldiers' submachine guns and grenades. This made some of the enemies, when exploring forward in cars, drive backward with the rear of the car in front, for the convenience of escaping when hit. However, they could not escape the fate of being hit, as there were People's soldiers waiting for them everywhere, front, rear, left, and right!
　　When ground counterattacks did not work, the enemy used planes to drop a large number of gasoline bombs from the air to burn the mountain. This also failed to conquer the people's soldiers. They covered themselves with snow or ice wrapped in coats or soaked in water and fought the fire. Neither the severe cold nor the raging fire could break the line of defense formed by the People's steel will. The soldiers fought more and more bravely.
　　The enemy in Sasu-ri constantly launched attacks northward with more than a dozen tanks leading the way, under the cover of aircraft, wanting to join up with the enemy in Sinhung-ri. A certain battalion of the People's Volunteer Army took on the task of blocking them, blocking the road for seven days and seven nights continuously. When food could not be delivered, they swallowed a few handfuls of soybeans every day to fill their stomachs, and ate snowballs and ice to quench their thirst. They destroyed nine enemy tanks and many cars, killing and wounding groups of enemies. Later, in addition to many heroic wounded comrades, there were less than a company's strength left. And on the last day, they heroically took on the task of attacking northward, annihilating an enemy battalion. When the enemy desperately fled in the southwest direction, they waded straight through the ice in the ravines blocking the path of pursuit, and bravely pursued in coordination with another unit of comrades. The enemy's tanks and cars took the main road, and the pursuing warriors took the small road. After many days of freezing, hunger, and fatigue, they finally overtook the tanks and cars from both sides of the enemy, cut in front of the enemy, and annihilated all four or five hundred fleeing enemies.
　　In order to break out and escape, the enemy carried out eight days and nights of frantic, desperate struggles; some tanks pulled cars, some cars pulled tanks, crashing around in all directions; tanks and cars were also crashing into each other. The People's soldiers fought these crashing, injured beasts with grenades and explosives. Some of the enemy's cars caught fire in the fuel tanks, some had their engines damaged, and some were abandoned intact. The enemy was beaten and fled out of the cars, then climbed back into the cars; climbed in and were beaten down again; fled to the west slope, and then turned back to the east slope; they could not escape the encirclement from there either.
　　The enemy finally collapsed.
　　In the great rout, the enemy was even more embarrassed. A dozen People's soldiers would chase two or three hundred enemies around. A volley of bullets would send hundreds of enemies turning back. At this time, the enemy only knew to escape for their lives, and wanted nothing else. Food was thrown away; kettles and lunch boxes were thrown away; coats and luggage were thrown away; heavy weapons were thrown away first; carbines were finally also thrown away. They instinctively burrowed like dogs into the piles of corpses under the tires. Chasing and chasing, a large number of enemies in front would suddenly lie down in the corpse pile pretending to be dead bodies; when the People's soldiers dragged them up, their first action was to point to their heads and wave their hands—meaning asking us not to shoot them in the head. The soldiers pointed to their mouths, indicating the rear; they understood that they were being told to go to the back to eat, and happily followed. Some even helped drive the cars, and said that as long as they were not killed, they would do anything. ...
　　The invaders received the punishment they deserved.
　　Along the seven or eight hundred li of highway north and south of Sinhung-ri, American planes and ground American beasts turned how many peaceful people's villages into ash heaps. Women were washing clothes by the river, farmers were chopping firewood and farming, and children were playing, all of whom would suddenly be strafed by American planes flying low, almost touching the hills, and fall in pools of blood. An American prisoner of war told reporters that when he first saw this situation, he thought the airmen were drunk and going crazy. Later, when he saw that every plane came every time to do the same thing, bombing and shooting peaceful villages and peaceful people, he could not explain it. He said: "I am ashamed of the behavior of our American Air Force!"
　　The behavior of the American ground forces in collectively shooting and burying alive thousands of Korean people, raping and killing Korean women in people's homes, in tanks and cars, and even in trenches, was more than just "shameful"!
　　These shameful and hateful acts ignited the flames of hatred in the hearts of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers. The enemy is now on the Eastern Front, like on the Western Front, being burned by these flames they themselves ignited.
　　After eight days and eight nights of fierce fighting, the first stage of the Eastern Front campaign ended victoriously. In Sinhung-ri, Yudam-ni, and Hagaru-ri, the American 7th Division and the American ace Marine 1st Division, which claimed to have never been defeated in the 160 years since its founding, except for some who fled or escaped by helicopter, were turned into corpses and prisoners. This area, dozens of miles long north and south, became a display ground for the corpses of the American imperialist invading Korean troops.
            II. The American Invading Army's Corpse Field
　　"On the Korean mountains, the name of the mountain is Kang Heng (transliteration). This is a place where bears and tigers roam, more than five thousand miles away from the United States.
　　Standing guard in the severe cold with a rifle on my back, or digging trenches with a pickaxe. Doing the work of a prisoner, just for three dollars a day.
　　No one cares if we live or die, no one gives us any comfort. We die for Uncle Sam today, and will be forgotten tomorrow.
　　We live in memories, thinking of our distant home and loved ones. Hopefully when we go back, they have not become someone else's lover."
　　On the corpse field of the American army in the Sinhung-ri area, such a poem was picked up from a dead body; we translated it completely according to the original meaning into the above translation.
　　The author of this poem's premonition has become a reality. To increase the money in Uncle Sam's purse, he has now become a zombie. What is different from his premonition is that he will not only "be forgotten," but many American soldiers who have become corpses like him will also suffer bombing by American planes after death.
　　The planes under MacArthur's command, flying over the American army's corpse field, continue to bomb and strafe without stopping; blasting many corpses into pieces. Some wounded but not dead American soldiers in the corpse pile thus lost their remaining lives. This is "Uncle Sam's" final elegy to them.
　　There are also people who will not forget them, and that is his mother, lover, and friends.
　　In the pockets on the corpses and in the pools of blood beside them, we picked up some letters. - Letters written to them from the United States and Japan by the dead's relatives. The letters hoped that they would "always be safe," "always be healthy," and "take good care of themselves"; hoping that they would "write more often and write back good news." A letter from a wife in California, USA, said: "I hope you will always love me and always be faithful to me, just like I am to you. I hope you come back earlier than expected. ... The radio is singing "When I Lost My Little Baby," and I pray to God: always bless my little baby! I live in hope." Another letter from the dead's mother wrote: "Christmas is coming. I have prepared the Spanish dishes, ham, banana pie, and whiskey that you love to eat. If you want to eat anything else, write and I will prepare it, as long as you come back before the festival." There was also a letter from a lover in Japan saying: "I hope you can come back as soon as possible to marry me, and go to Hawaii for our honeymoon after marriage. ... Last night, I dreamed that we were getting married, and I really didn't want to wake up. ...!"
　　They were originally supposed to be reunited with their mothers, wives, and lovers, but they were forced, deceived, or came to Korea "five thousand miles away from the United States" "for three dollars a day." When they arrived in Korea, if they obediently laid down their weapons in battle and surrendered to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they could still save their lives and wait to go back and marry their lovers, go on their honeymoon, and eat ham and banana pie made by their mothers. But they did not do this, they still resisted with guns, so they lay shamefully and silently on the frozen land of Korea.
　　The people are generous enough to the American prisoners of war. They are given food and shelter, and their illnesses are treated and their wounds are healed. Their original US dollars, military currency, and even harmonicas and pens, etc., are still in their own pockets. On the beach of Sinhung-ri, two American soldiers who had been half-dead woke up in a broken American truck. Soldiers and people passing by even gave them fried noodles and cigarettes. As long as they are no longer bombed by American planes, they are lucky.
　　Those unfortunate and deservedly dead corpses are lying in the ditches, on the hillsides, in the fields, and by the roads, piled up inside and outside the bodies of paralyzed tanks and large trucks, next to the cars, and under the wheels. The broken flesh and blood on the corpses are frozen with ice and snow, appearing particularly hideous and ugly. Accompanying them are only some broken and messy radios, typewriters, stoves, gas lamps, down sleeping bags, woolen clothes... The carbines, automatic rifles, machine guns, recoilless guns, shells, bullets, and vehicles that they used to slaughter the people during their lifetime were taken up by the people's soldiers to continue to pursue and annihilate those enemies who still refused to surrender.

　　在朝鲜东线战场上
    本报记者  林韦
            一、冰雪中的肉搏
    十一月中，当美军前锋部队窜到朝鲜北部长津湖南一带，愚蠢地狂叫着要冲向鸭绿江的时候，一个美国的随军记者就说“总觉着有人在盯着他们”。这句话没有说错，那时，他们确实是被四面射来的仇恨的目光和枪口“盯着”了。
    不愿被奴役的人民和人民的军队，不顾敌人日日夜夜的轰炸，忍受着零下二、三十度的严寒，沿着长津湖畔的高山峻岭，爬过积雪的丛林和沟渠，逆着敌人前进的方向，静悄悄地在敌人前后左右密密层层布置开来，逐渐把敌人装进巨大的口袋里去。十一月二十七日，数万美军就被分割包围在下碣隅里、柳潭里、新兴里三个圈圈里了。人民的战士们，在铁一样坚硬的冰冻了的土地上挖掘了避弹坑，严密监视着被包围了的敌人。他们研究着各种攻击动作和配合计划，发誓要把这群野蛮的侵略者消灭干净，为朝鲜数十万无辜的被杀害的和平人民索还血债，保证中国的和平人民不再遭受屠杀。
    二十七日夜间，冲锋号响了起来，人民战士们从冰雪中攀着树枝柴草，悄悄地迅速地接近了敌人。许多重要山头，重要阵地上立即展开了肉搏战。
    不知命运将尽的敌人，起初还进行顽抗。可是，敌人任何密集的火力也阻挠不了我们的人民志愿战士进攻的意志。在弹雨下，冲锋，再冲锋！为了夺取敌人一个山头，有时要连续三、四次地冲锋。为了守住一个已经夺下的山头，有时要连续击退敌人四、五次的反扑。在十二月四、五日敌人彻底溃败之前，这种阵地争夺战连续进行了六、七天。可是、不管怎样，每一战斗的最后胜利总是属于人民战士们。世所罕见的英勇的中国人民志愿军，几乎每个连队都在每一步路上取得了胜利的结局，完成了自己担负的任务。
    有一个连队，奉命在白天攻夺一个急需攻占的山头。尽管成群敌机俯冲到树梢上来不断地遍地扫射轰炸，尽管山头上敌人的自动火器密集地射击，人民战士们在雪坡上滑下来又爬上去，前仆后继，勇猛前进，连冲三次，终于把红旗插上了山头。
    敌人原以为他们的坦克能救他们的命，他们向我们夺取到的阵地反扑时，或是企图突围逃跑时，总把大批坦克放在前面。人民志愿军没有坦克，反坦克武器也缺乏，可是战士们并没有在坦克面前畏缩，他们只靠手榴弹和炸药，靠勇敢与智慧，还是征服了许多坦克，把敌人的坦克炸翻，炸得不能动弹。
    敌人的汽车、在人民战士们面前自然就更不顶用了，比坦克被炸毁打毁得更多好多倍。打坏的车子上的敌人想跳车逃跑时，就更容易地挨上人民战士们的冲锋枪和手榴弹。这使得有些乘着汽车的敌人探索着前进时，用车屁股在前倒着走，为的是挨打时逃跑的方便。可是，这样也躲不过挨打的命运的，在他们前后左右那里没有人民战士在等着他们啊！
    地面的反扑不顶用，敌人就又以飞机配合从空中扔下大批汽油弹来烧山。这也没有能够征服人民战士们。他们用大衣包着冰雪或浸了水，与大火搏斗。严寒和烈火都摧折不了人民的钢铁意志结成的阵线，战士们是愈战愈奋了。
    泗水里的敌人不断地以十多辆坦克带头，在飞机掩护下，向北冲击，想和新兴里的敌人汇合。人民志愿军某营担任了堵击任务，横拦在公路上，连续战斗了七天七夜。饭送不上来，每天就吞几把大豆充饥，吃雪团冰块解渴。他们击毁了敌人九辆坦克和许多汽车，杀伤了成群成队的敌人。后来，除了许多英勇负伤的同志，只有不足一个连的兵力。而他们最后一天又英勇地担任了向北出击、歼敌一营的任务。敌人拚命向西南方向逃跑时，他们从横在追击的路上的涧水冰块中直淌过去，协同另一部同志勇猛追击。敌人的坦克、汽车走大路，追击的勇士们走小路。在多日的冻饿的疲困之后，他们终于还是从敌军两侧赶过坦克、汽车，插到敌人前面，把逃敌四、五百人全部歼灭。
    敌人为了突围逃命，连续进行了八昼夜的慌乱的拚死挣扎；有的坦克引着汽车，有的汽车引着坦克，四下乱撞；坦克汽车也在互相乱撞。人民战士们用手榴弹和炸药和这些乱撞的受伤的野兽搏斗。敌人的汽车有的烧着了油箱，有的被打坏了机器，有的完好无恙地扔弃了。敌人被打得逃下车来，又爬上车去；爬上去又被打下来；逃向西坡，又折回东坡；从那里也逃不出包围圈。
    敌人最后溃败了。
    在大溃败中，敌人是更狼狈了。十来个人民战士，会追得二、三百敌人乱窜。迎面一梭子弹，会打得成百敌人向后转。这时，敌人只知道要逃命，什么也不要了。吃的，丢掉了；水壶、饭盒，丢掉了；大衣、行装，丢掉了；重武器，先丢掉了；卡宾枪最后也扔了。像狗一样下意识地往轮胎下死尸堆中乱钻。追着追着，前面大批的敌人会忽然躺倒在尸堆里装死尸；待人民战士把他们硬拖起来时，他们第一个动作就是指指脑袋，摆一摆手——意思就是求我们不要向他头上打枪。战士们指指嘴巴，指示后方；他们明白了是叫他们到后面去吃饭，便高兴地跟着来了。有的还帮着开车，并表示只要不杀，叫干什么都可以。……
    侵略者得到了他们应得的惩罚。
    新兴里南北七、八百里公路沿线上，美军飞机和地面美国野兽们把多少和平人民安居乐业的村庄变成了灰渣场。妇女正在河边洗衣服，农夫正在打柴、种田，孩子正在玩耍，都会突然遭到几乎擦着小山岗低飞的美军飞机扫射，倒在血泊里。一个美国俘虏对记者说，他起初看到这种情形时，以为是航空员喝酒喝醉了，发酒疯。以后看到每架飞机每次飞来都是干同样的勾当，炸射和平的村庄、和平的人民，他不能解释了。他说：“我为我们美国空军的行为感到羞耻！”
    美军地面部队成千成百集体枪杀、活埋朝鲜人民，在人们家里、在坦克车汽车里以至在战壕里强奸与杀害朝鲜妇女的行为，那就更不仅只是令人“感到羞耻”了！
    这可羞耻可憎恨的行为，在朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿战士们的心中燃起了仇恨的怒火。敌人现在在东线也和西线一样已经被他们自己点起的这些火焰烧到身上了。
    经过八天八夜的激战，东线战役的第一阶段胜利结束了。在新兴里、柳潭里、下碣隅里，美军第七师和自称建军一百六十年从未打过败仗的美军王牌陆战第一师除一部分逃散或乘直升飞机逃跑外，都变成了死尸和俘虏。这一带，南北数十里长的地方，成了美帝侵朝军队的死尸陈列场。
            二、美国侵略军的尸场“在朝鲜的山峰上，山的名字叫康衡（译音）。这里是熊虎出没之地，离开美国有五千多英里。
　背着来福枪在严寒中站岗，或者用镐镢挖掘壕堑。干着囚犯一般的活，只为着一天三块钱。
　没人管我们是活是死，没人给我们一点安慰。我们今天为山姆大叔死去，明天就会被人忘记。
　我们生活在回忆之中，想念着辽远的家乡和爱人。但愿我们回去的时候，她们没有变成别人的爱人。”
    在新兴里一带美军的尸场上，从一个死尸身上拣到了这样一首诗；我们把它完全照原意翻译成上面的译文。
    这首诗的作者的预想已经变成事实。为着增加山姆大叔钱袋里的钞票，他现在已经成为僵尸。和他预想还有不同的是：他不仅“会被人忘记”，和他同样成为死尸的许多美国兵，死后还要遭受美国飞机的轰炸。
    麦克阿瑟指挥下的飞机，飞翔在美军的尸场上，仍然不断头地轰炸、扫射；把许多死尸炸得骨肉纷飞。在尸堆中有些受伤未死的美国兵，这样也就丧了残生。这就是“山姆大叔”对他们的最后的凭吊。
    也还有人并不会就忘记了他们，那就是他的母亲、爱人和朋友们。
    在尸体上的口袋里和身旁边的血泊中，我们拣到一些信。——死者的亲人们从美国、日本写给他们的信。信中希望他们“永远平安”，“永远健康”，“善自珍重”；希望他们“多多来信，写回来好的消息”。一封寄自美国加里福尼亚的妻子的信中说：“希望你永远爱我，永远忠实于我，像我对你一样。希望你比预期为早地归来。……收音机正在唱着“当我失去我的小宝宝”，我祈祷上帝：永远保佑我的小宝宝！我生活在期望之中。”另一封死者的母亲的来信中写着：“圣诞节就要来了。我已准备好了你所爱吃的西班牙菜、火腿和香蕉排、威士忌。你如果想吃别的，来信我就准备，只要你节前归来。”还有一封寄自日本的爱人的信中说：“希望你能尽早归来与我结婚，结婚后到夏威夷去渡蜜月。……昨夜，我梦见我们结婚，我真不愿醒来。……！”
    他们原是应该和母亲、妻子、爱人团聚在一起的，可是，他们被逼迫着、被欺骗着或者“为了一天三块钱”到“离开美国有五千多英里”的朝鲜来了。到了朝鲜，他们如果在战斗中乖乖地放下武器向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军投降，他们也还是可以保全性命等将来回去和爱人结婚、渡蜜月，吃母亲做的火腿香蕉排的。可是他们没有这样做，他们还持枪抵抗，于是他们就可耻地无声无息地躺在朝鲜的冰冻的土地上了。
    对于美国俘虏，人民是够宽大的。给了他们吃的住的，给他们治病疗伤。他们原有的美金、军用钞票以至口琴、钢笔等什物，都仍然装在自己的口袋里。在新兴里河滩，一辆美国破卡车中有两个曾经半死的美国兵苏醒了过来，战士和人民路过时还给他们炒面和香烟。只要不再遭到美国飞机轰炸，他们都是幸运的了。
    那些不幸而又活该的死尸，则横陈在河沟里，山坡上，田野间，道路旁，堆积在瘫痪了的坦克车、大卡车的车身内外、车旁、轮下。尸体上破碎的血肉凝结着冰雪，显得格外狰狞难看。在他们身旁陪伴他们的，只是一些摔坏了的、乱七八糟的无线电收音机、打字机、汽炉、汽灯、鸭绒睡袋、呢绒衣服……。他们生前用以屠杀人民的卡宾枪，自动步枪、机关枪、无座力炮、炮弹、枪弹和车辆，则被人民战士们拿起来继续追歼那些仍然不肯投降的敌人去了。（附图片）
