Overview of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
　　Mao Aohai
　　I. Geographical Environment and Pre-Liberation Conditions

　　The Inner Mongolia region is located between 96 degrees 34 minutes to 124 degrees 55 minutes east longitude, and 37 degrees 35 minutes to 53 degrees north latitude, forming a long and narrow zone in northern China, extending over 5,000 li. It borders the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic to the north, and connects to the Northeast, North China, and Northwest administrative regions to the south. It mainly includes the western part of the Northeast region and various leagues and banners of the Mongolian ethnic group within the provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia. The total population is approximately six million, of which about two million are Mongolian. The total area is approximately 1.4 million square kilometers. According to the differences in production and lifestyle, the region can be divided into three types: nomadic, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral, and purely agricultural areas. The population distribution is as follows: about 500,000 people in the northern nomadic area; the rest are concentrated in the southern semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral and purely agricultural areas. The Mongolian people mostly live together with the Hui and Han people, engaging in agriculture and animal husbandry.

　　The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (stationed in Zhangjiakou) now directly leads six leagues (Xingan, Hulunbuir, Jirem, Ju Ud, Chahar, Xilingol), including thirty-two banners, seven counties, and three league-administered cities. The total area is approximately 600,000 square kilometers, with a population of 2.3 million.

　　The Mongolian people of the Inner Mongolia region still lived a nomadic life seven hundred years ago; many tribes were scattered throughout the territory. Later, under the leadership of the Mongolian national hero Genghis Khan (Temujin), various tribes were unified into a unified nation. The Mongolian people were once known for their bravery in history, but since the rule of the Manchus, and during the three hundred years before liberation, they have been subjected to devastation, oppression, and slaughter by the Manchus, the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang reactionaries, Japanese imperialism, and the scum within the Mongolian nation itself. This has resulted in the economic underdevelopment of the Inner Mongolia people before liberation, difficult living conditions, cultural backwardness, and the prevalence of plagues, venereal diseases, and opium smoking due to the lack of medical and health facilities, which seriously hindered the survival and development of the Inner Mongolia people. Only after liberation, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party and under the direct leadership of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, have the Inner Mongolia people gradually escaped the disasters imposed by the reactionary rulers and embarked on a path of great development.

　　II. Inner Mongolia After the Implementation of Regional Autonomy

　　After August 15, 1945, in eastern Inner Mongolia, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, national regional autonomy was implemented, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation was established, beginning to organize and educate the masses and initially implementing democratic reforms. On May 1, 1947, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, headed by Chairman Ulanhu, was established. Over the past three years, significant achievements have been made in various constructions, transforming the face of the Inner Mongolia region, which has always been regarded as backward, and presenting a thriving new atmosphere.

　　1. In Military Affairs

　　After the establishment of the People's Government, the Chiang bandit troops, with the assistance and instigation of American imperialism, constantly launched attacks on the Inner Mongolia region, disrupting social order, plundering livestock and property, and seriously threatening the various construction works and the safety of the people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Therefore, at the request of the broad masses of the people, the Inner Mongolia People's own army - the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army - was organized.

　　According to statistics as of May 1st of last year, the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army has fought a total of 654 battles since its establishment, annihilating 21,900 enemies, capturing 12,234 enemies, and 2,737 enemies surrendered; seizing more than 70 various cannons, 22,491 war horses, and many other guns, ammunition, cars, and other materials.

　　This heroic people's army, inheriting the historical traditions of its own nation, under the unified leadership and command of the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to drive the running dogs of American imperialism - the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang - out of the land of Inner Mongolia.

　　2. In Politics

　　Now, the governments at all levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been transformed into people's governments that wholeheartedly serve the people; and people's representative conferences of all sectors (including all strata) have been convened in many banners and counties, uniting the people of Inner Mongolia to jointly build a new Inner Mongolia.

　　In agricultural areas, land reform has been implemented according to the demands of the Inner Mongolia people; in pastoral areas, a policy of free grazing and rewarding the development of livestock has been implemented, so that the Inner Mongolia people have not only politically turned over, but their economic lives have also been unprecedentedly improved.

　　3. In Production and Construction

　　Since the completion of land reform, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has actively led the people in carrying out a great production movement. It advocated labor mutual aid, encouraged land reclamation, improved agricultural tools, developed water conservancy, applied large amounts of fertilizer, and issued agricultural loans to help farmers carry out production. According to 1949 statistics, the cultivated land area in the agricultural areas of the five leagues in Inner Mongolia (Xingan, Jirem, Ju Ud, Hulunbuir, Chahar) was 1,437,110 hectares, an increase of 78,984 hectares compared to 1948 (calculated at 1 hectare equals 10 mu).

　　In the past, farmers in the Inner Mongolia region, especially Mongolian farmers, did not apply manure when farming. With the vigorous advocacy of the government, the application of manure in various agricultural areas began in 1947. According to 1948 statistics, manured land in the agricultural areas of various leagues accounted for 10% of the total cultivated land area. In 1949, it rose to 23%, thus increasing grain production. According to 1948 statistics from the Hulunbuir League, the average yield per hectare in the league in the past was only 1,200 jin of grain; while in 1949, the average yield per hectare reached 1,600 jin.

　　In addition, the Nawen Farm, run by the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, began plowing with tractors (there were seven) in April 1950, greatly inspiring the nearby farmers. At the same time, the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry also helped farmers in various places purchase various new-style and improved agricultural tools to improve productivity.

　　In terms of animal husbandry, according to 1949 statistics, 1,483,321 livestock were vaccinated in the four leagues of Hulunbuir, Xing'an, Jirem, and Ju Ud, and a total of 6,551 sick livestock (including horse mange, anthrax, and rinderpest) were cured. In addition, in order to ensure the safety of livestock, the People's Government of the Autonomous Region led a large-scale livestock protection and wolf hunting campaign. According to 1949 statistics, the four leagues of Hulunbuir, Xing'an, Chahar, and Ju Ud alone killed 6,190 wolves, greatly reducing the losses of herdsmen.

　　In order to better develop animal husbandry, the People's Government also paid attention to improving breeding stock and adjusting breeding stock, and mobilized the masses to cut grass and dig wells, while issuing large amounts of livestock loans (5 billion yuan in 1950 alone). Therefore, the phenomenon of gradual reduction of livestock in the past has changed to a year-by-year increase. For example, the Hulunbuir League had 400,000 head of livestock when it was liberated on August 15, 1945, and increased to 800,000 head by 1949. Taking the three leagues of Hulunbuir, Xing'an, and Jirem as examples, a total of 379,799 horses, cattle, and sheep were added in 1949, accounting for 27.43% of the total number of horses, cattle, and sheep in the three leagues. In this way, the vast pastures that had been severely damaged by the reactionaries have begun to be restored and constructed.

　　In terms of forestry, Inner Mongolia's forest area accounts for one-sixth of the country's forest area. Due to the Japanese invaders' predatory logging, the forests suffered serious damage. After the establishment of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, it actively managed logging and carried out forest protection work. In 1949, 320,000 cubic meters of timber were logged, and it was planned to log 400,000 cubic meters in 1950. According to statistics from the beginning of summer in 1950, 90.5% of the annual plan has been completed. Now, "rational logging" is being promoted, and the timber production is being actively increased.

　　4. In Finance and Economy

　　After the establishment of the People's Government, the situation of each league and banner being financially independent was changed, various financial systems were established, various unreasonable institutions were reorganized, unified revenue and expenditure were implemented, and a path of accumulating funds for economic construction was gradually embarked on from the situation of self-sufficiency. In the entire fiscal expenditure in 1950, industrial investment accounted for 22.6% of the total budget. The Inner Mongolia People's Bank issued a large number of agricultural, pastoral, and cooperative loans to support the people in carrying out production.

　　In the past, the Inner Mongolia region suffered from the exploitative plunder of speculative merchants. In order to change this situation, the People's Government paid great attention to solving the problem of supplying the people's daily necessities. According to incomplete statistics, the cloth sold by state-owned trading agencies in Inner Mongolia in 1949 averaged 7 chi per person; the average grain supply to grassland areas reached 125 jin per person, reaching about 50% of the people's purchasing power. At the same time, the government used its power to help the people establish cooperatives. According to statistics before June of last year, there were more than 600 cooperatives at all levels in the four leagues of Chebu, and the goods supplied to the people in 1949 accounted for about 20% of the people's purchasing power. This greatly reduced intermediate exploitation and improved people's lives.

　　5. In Culture and Education

　　The People's Government is actively working to improve the culture of the Inner Mongolia people. According to incomplete statistics before June 1950, the four eastern leagues of Xing'an, Ju Ud, Jirem, and Hulunbuir had a total of 3,835 primary schools, averaging nearly two schools per gacha (administrative village); the total number of students reached 186,353, accounting for 70% of the total number of school-age children. Compared with the puppet Manchu era, the number of schools has increased three times and the number of students has increased by more than one and a half times compared with the year with the most schools at that time (1943). In order to improve the cultural level of the masses, a learning movement was widely launched in the autonomous region. According to statistics from the seven banners in the Jirem League, the number of winter school literacy classes established in 1949 was 6,785, and the number of men and women enrolled reached 93,600, accounting for 10.6% of the total population of the region. The number of students enrolled in the Xing'an League was 74,200, accounting for 29.3% of the league's population. In terms of publishing books, according to statistics before June 1950, a complete set of Mongolian primary and secondary school textbooks and teacher reference materials were published, totaling 44 types and 435,200 copies; in addition, there were 6 types of social education textbooks, 42,569 copies; in addition, the Inner Mongolia Daily also published more than 150 kinds of Mongolian books and periodicals, totaling 450,000 copies.

　　In terms of literature and art, the Inner Mongolia Literary and Art Troupe, which is known to all, is active in various parts of Inner Mongolia. The troupe combines new democratic content with national forms, creating more than 100 types of songs, dances, and dramas, which are warmly welcomed by the masses of Inner Mongolia. In 1950, 70 members of the troupe came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration and performed famous dances such as the saber dance and the wild goose dance, which were highly praised by people from all walks of life in Beijing.

　　Regarding the religious issue, Lamaism is the most widely believed religion in the Inner Mongolia region. The People's Government has resolutely implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief. Now, many lamas have organized medical colleges, and they have also been allocated land, so the lives of many lamas have also improved compared to before. People's governments at all levels have hired many older lamas and Living Buddhas as government consultants or counselors. Young lamas who voluntarily request to study are encouraged to study; those who voluntarily chant scriptures are also completely free. Under such a religious policy, the lamas are also very satisfied. For example, there were three Living Buddhas in the delegation of various ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region who participated in the National Day last year. One of them, Representative Maidali Gegen Living Buddha, said: "In the past, it was thought that the Communist Party would eliminate the lamas, but the facts have proved that this is completely wrong. Today, I am not only a Living Buddha, but also a government consultant, and I am even more highly regarded by the government than before."

　　6. Epidemic Prevention Work

　　One very important achievement that should be especially mentioned is epidemic prevention work. As mentioned earlier, the plague, which threatened the lives of the people of Inner Mongolia, occurred every year during the rule of Japanese imperialism. However, through the efforts of the party, government, army, and people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, especially with the assistance of the Northeast People's Government and the Soviet epidemic prevention team, the work of preventing and controlling the plague has made great achievements. According to statistics, the number of plague cases in 1947 was 15,710, which dropped to 345 in 1949; the number of deaths decreased from 13,315 to 196. In 1949, 153,754 people were vaccinated, 9,700,599 rats were caught, and 15 million meters of rat-proof ditches were dug. Experience has proved that this epidemic disease that threatens human survival can be completely prevented and controlled; and preliminary achievements have been made in the process of prevention and control. The People's Government is planning to strive to stop the occurrence of the plague in the autonomous region within three to five years.

　　7. Other Ethnic Minorities in the Autonomous Region

　　In addition to the Mongolian and Han nationalities, there are also Daguor (the transliteration of "Dahur" is incorrect, "Hu" should be changed to "Gu"), Oroqen, Solon, Tungus, Buryat Mongolian, and other very few Xibe and Hezhe ethnic minorities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. They are now living a happier and freer life than before, just like the Mongolian people. Those who live in agricultural areas have been allocated land; in pastoral areas, they also enjoy the treatment of free grazing, and some have established their own ethnic areas. For example, there are about 1,000 Oroqen people in the autonomous region, living in the forests and making a living by hunting. During the rule of Japanese imperialism, the furs they hunted were sometimes bought at low prices and sometimes confiscated without compensation, making their lives very difficult. After the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Oroqen people's district government was organized, allowing them to manage their own affairs. After several years of work, many Oroqen people have accepted new culture, and some are willing to study in Inner Mongolia schools. They have also established cooperatives, exchanging daily necessities through cooperatives, such as buying their furs at equal prices and providing them with food. Now, the People's Government is absorbing their cadres to study in Inner Mongolia schools.

　　Some nomadic peoples have also settled down. Some live in simple thatched huts made of birch bark or branches. In winter, some people put their children in leather tubes and hang them on trees to live. If these ethnic groups are not vigorously helped, it will be difficult for them to survive and develop. Therefore, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region cares for and helps the ethnic minorities in the autonomous region in various ways. This not only solves the survival and development problems of the Mongolian people, but also solves the survival and development problems of other ethnic minorities in the autonomous region.

　　From the above-mentioned achievements in various constructions in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, we can see that the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the people of all ethnic groups in the country have truly obtained the freedom of common development. The lives of the people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have now improved. In the past, the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region could not get enough to eat and wear warm clothes, and many people still wore fur coats in the summer, and women had no pants to wear. This life is gone forever. This fully proves that the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policy can truly solve China's ethnic problems.

　　内蒙古自治区概况
    茂敖海
    一、地理环境和解放前概况
    内蒙古地区，位于东经九十六度三十四分至一百二十四度五十五分，北纬三十七度三十五分至五十三度之间；全长五千多华里，形成我国北部的狭长地带。北界苏联及蒙古人民共和国，南连东北、华北及西北三大行政区，主要包括东北区的西部及察哈尔、绥远、宁夏等省境的蒙古民族各盟旗。总人口共约六百万，其中蒙族约二百万。全面积约一百四十余万平方公里。按照生产、生活方式的区别，全区可分为游牧、半农半牧和纯农业等三种地区。人口分布情况是，在北部即游牧区约五十万人；其余都集中在南部半农半牧和纯农业区，蒙族人民，多与回、汉人民杂居，从事农业和牧畜业生产。
      内蒙古自治区人民政府（驻张家口）现在直接领导下的有六个盟（兴安、呼纳、哲里木、昭乌达、察哈尔、锡林郭勒），包括三十二个旗，七个县，三个盟辖市。总面积约六十余万平方公里，人口二百三十万。
    内蒙古地区的蒙古民族，七百年前还过着游牧生活；境内散居着许多种族部落。后在蒙古民族英雄成吉思汗（铁木真）的领导下，才把各个种族部落统一起来，成为一个统一的民族。蒙古民族，在历史上曾一度以骠悍著称，但自满清统治以来，直至解放前的三百年间，一直受着满清、北洋军阀、国民党反动派、日本帝国主义以及蒙古民族内部的败类的摧残、压榨和屠杀，造成内蒙古人民在解放前的经济不发展，人民生活困苦，文化落后，以及因缺乏医药卫生设备，致使鼠疫、花柳病、鸦片烟等害流行，严重地妨害了内蒙古人民的生存和发展。只有解放后，在中国共产党的帮助下，在自治区人民政府的直接领导下，内蒙古人民才逐渐摆脱了反动统治者所给予的灾难，走上了大踏步发展的坦途。
  二、实行区域自治后的内蒙古
    一九四五年“八一五”以后，在内蒙东部，在人民解放军的帮助下，实行了民族区域自治，成立了内蒙古自治运动联合会，开始组织与教育群众，初步实行了民主改革。一九四七年五月一日，又成立了以乌兰夫主席为首的内蒙古自治区人民政府。三年来，各种建设都已获得了显著的成绩，使一贯被目为落后的内蒙地区的面貌为之改观，呈现欣欣向荣的新气象。
        一、在军事方面
    人民政府成立以后，蒋匪军在美帝国主义援助与授意下，不断向内蒙古地区发动进攻，扰乱社会治安，抢夺牲畜财产，严重地威胁着内蒙古自治区各种建设工作和人民的安全。因此在广大人民要求下，组织了内蒙古人民自己的军队——内蒙古人民解放军。
    根据去年五月一日的统计，内蒙人民解放军自成立以来，共作战六百五十四次，歼灭敌人二万一千九百人，俘敌一万二千二百三十四人，敌投降者二千七百三十七人；缴获各种炮七十多门，战马二万二千四百九十一匹及其他枪炮、子弹、汽车等物资甚多。
    这一支英勇的人民军队，继承着本民族的历史传统，在人民解放军总部统一领导与指挥下，配合人民解放军，把美帝国主义的走狗——蒋介石匪帮从内蒙土地上赶了出去。
        二、政治方面
    现在内蒙古自治区内各级政权，都已经过改造，成为全心全意为人民服务的人民政权；并在不少的旗县召开了各界（包括各阶层）人民代表会议，团结了内蒙人民，共同建设新内蒙。
    在农业区，根据内蒙人民的要求，已实行了土地改革；在游牧区，实行了放牧自由以及奖励发展牲畜的政策，使内蒙人民，不仅在政治上翻了身，经济生活也得到空前的改善。
        三、生产建设方面
    自土地改革完成后，内蒙古自治区人民政府就积极地领导人民进行大生产运动。提倡劳动互助，奖励开荒，改良农具，开发水利，大量施肥，并发放农业贷款，帮助农民进行生产。据一九四九年统计，内蒙五个盟（兴安、哲里木、昭乌达、呼纳、察哈尔）的农业区耕地面积是一百四十三万七千一百一十垧，比一九四八年增加了七万八千九百八十四垧（按每垧等于十市亩）。
    在过去，内蒙地区的农民，特别是蒙族农民，种地是不上粪的。经政府大力提倡，自一九四七年起，各农业区已开始上粪，据一九四八年的统计，各盟农业区上粪地占总耕地面积的百分之十。在一九四九年又上升到百分之二十三，因此粮食的产量增加了。据呼纳盟一九四八年统计，该盟过去平均每垧地只打一千二百斤粮；而在一九四九年，每垧地的产量平均达到了一千六百斤。
    此外，内蒙古自治区人民政府农牧部所办的纳文农场，从一九五○年四月开始用拖拉机（有七台）耕作，大大地鼓舞了附近的农民。同时农牧部也帮助各地农民购买各种新式农具与改良农具，以提高生产力。
    在牧业方面，据一九四九年的统计，在呼纳、兴安、哲里木、昭乌达四个盟内进行预防注射的牲畜达一百四十八万三千三百二十一头，治好各种病畜（内有马癞、炭疽、牛瘟等病）共六千五百五十一头。另外，为保障牲畜的安全，自治区人民政府曾领导了大规模的保畜打狼运动。据一九四九年的统计，仅呼纳、兴安、察哈尔、昭乌达四盟即打狼六千一百九十只，使牧民的损失大大减少。
    人民政府为了使牧畜业更好的发展，还注意了改良种畜和调剂种畜，并发动群众打草、打井，同时发放大量牧畜贷款（仅一九五○年即为五十亿元）。因此，过去牲畜逐渐减少的现象，已一变而为逐年上升。如呼纳盟在一九四五年“八一五”解放时有四十万头，到一九四九年增加到八十万头。再以呼纳、兴安、哲里木三盟为例，在一九四九年内共增殖了马、牛、羊达三十七万九千七百九十九头，为该三盟马、牛、羊总数的百分之二七点四三。这样就把过去受反动派所严重破坏过的广大牧场，又开始恢复与建设起来了。
    林业方面，内蒙森林面积占全国森林面积的六分之一，由于日寇曾采取抢夺式的采伐，使森林遭受了严重破坏。自治区人民政府成立以后，即积极经营采伐与进行护林工作。在一九四九年采伐木材三十二万立方米，一九五○年计划采伐四十万立方米。据一九五○年夏初统计，已完成全年计划百分之九十点五。现在正在提倡“合理采伐”，积极提高木材生产量。
        四、财政经济方面
    人民政府成立以后，改变了各盟旗在财政上各自为政的状况，建立了各种财政制度，整编了各种不合理的机构，实行了统筹统支，并从自给自足的情况逐渐走向积累资金进行经济建设的道路。在一九五○年度的整个财政支出中，工业投资占总预算的百分之二十二点六。内蒙人民银行则发放了大量农、牧、合作贷款，支持人民进行生产。
    过去，内蒙地区深受投机商人掠夺性的剥削，为了改变这种状况，人民政府极其注意解决群众生活必需品的供应问题。据不完全统计，在一九四九年内国营贸易机关所推销的布匹，在内蒙境内每人平均为七尺；供给草地粮食平均每人达一百二十五斤，已达群众购买力的百分之五十左右。同时政府又用大力帮助群众建立合作社。据去年六月前的统计，车部四个盟中有各级合作社六百余处，在一九四九年供给群众的货物约占群众购买力的百分之二十。这样就大大减少了中间剥削，改善了人民生活。
        五、文教方面
    人民政府为提高内蒙人民的文化而积极工作。根据一九五○年六月前不完全统计，东部兴安、昭乌达、哲里木、呼纳四盟共有小学三千八百三十五所，平均每个嘎查（行政村）将近两所；学生总数达十八万六千三百五十三人，占学龄儿童总数的百分之七十。如果同伪满时代比较，则比当时学校最多的年份（一九四三年），学校增加了三倍，学生增加了一倍半以上。为了提高群众的文化水平，在自治区内广泛地开展了学习运动。根据哲盟境内七个旗的统计，一九四九年所设立的冬学识字班为六千七百八十五处，男女入学人数达九万三千六百人，占该地区总人口数百分之十点六。兴安盟入学人数为七万四千二百人，占该盟人数百分之二十九点三。在出版书籍方面，据一九五○年六月前统计，共出版蒙文初、高小教科书全套及教师参考资料四十四种，共四十三万五千二百册；另有社会教育课本六种，四万二千五百六十九册；此外，内蒙古日报社还出版了各种蒙文书刊一百五十余种，共四十五万册。
    在文艺方面，有人所共知的内蒙古文艺工作团活跃于内蒙各地。该团以新民主主义的内容结合民族形式，创作了歌、舞、剧等一百余种，受到内蒙群众的热烈欢迎。该团一九五○年有七十人来京参加国庆节，演出了著名的马刀舞、雁舞等舞蹈，颇受京市各界人民的赞许。
    关于宗教问题，内蒙地区以信仰喇嘛教者为最多，人民政府坚决执行了信教自由的政策。现在有不少喇嘛，组织了医学院，而且他们也分得了土地，因此许多喇嘛生活也较前改善。各级人民政府，聘请了不少年龄较大的喇嘛及活佛，作政府的顾问或参事。青年喇嘛自愿要求读书的，鼓励他们读书；自愿念经的也是完全自由。在这样的宗教政策之下，喇嘛们也很表满意。如去年参加国庆的内蒙自治区各民族代表团里有三个活佛，其中有一位代表麦达力葛根活佛说：“从前认为共产党要消灭喇嘛，但是事实证明这是完全想错了。今天我不仅是个活佛，又是政府的顾问，反而比从前还受政府的高看了。”
        六、防疫工作
    应该特别提及的一件很重要的成绩是防疫工作。如前所述，威胁内蒙人民生命的鼠疫病，在日本帝国主义统治时代每年都要发生。但是经过内蒙古自治区党、政、军、民以及医务工作者的努力，特别是在东北人民政府和苏联防疫队的协助下，防治鼠疫的工作是有很大成绩的。据统计，一九四七年鼠疫发病人数是一万五千七百一十人，到一九四九年就降到三百四十五人；死亡人数则由一万三千三百一十五人减少到一百九十六人。一九四九年预防注射十五万三千七百五十四人，捕鼠九百七十万零五百九十九只，挖防鼠沟一千五百万米。经验证明，这种威胁人类生存的疫病，是完全可以防治的；并在防治过程中，已初步得到了成绩。人民政府正计划于三、五年内争取在自治区内停止鼠疫的发生。
        七、自治区域内的其它少数民族
    内蒙古自治区域内除蒙、汉等民族外，还有达古尔（达呼尔译音不正，“呼”应改为“古”）、鄂伦春、索伦、通古斯、布里维特蒙古以及其他很少数的锡泊、赫哲等少数民族，他们已和蒙族人民同样过着比以前幸福自由的生活。他们住在农业区的已分得了土地；在牧业区里，也享受着牧放自由的待遇，有的已成立了自己的民族区。如鄂伦春族在自治区内有一千人左，右生活在森林中，以打猎为生。日本帝国主义统治时代，把他们猎获的皮张有时贱价收买，有时无代价的没收，使得他们的生活非常困苦。内蒙古自治区人民政府成立以后，组织了鄂伦春人的区政府，使他们自己人管理自己的事。经过数年来的工作，许多鄂伦春人接受了新的文化，有的人愿意到内蒙学校学习。他们又成立了合作社，通过合作社交换生活必需品，如以等价交换收购他们的皮货，给他们以粮食等。现在人民政府正吸收他们的干部，到内蒙学校学习。
    游牧民族也有定居的。有的住在很简单的用桦树皮或树枝搭盖成的茅屋里。到冬天，把小孩放入皮筒内，挂在树上生活的也有。对于这些民族如果不大力帮助，他们是很难生存和发展的。因此，内蒙古自治区人民政府用各种办法关怀与帮助自治区内的少数民族。这样不仅解决了蒙族人民的生存和发展问题，同时也解决了自治区内的其它少数民族的生存和发展的问题。
    从内蒙古自治区以上各种建设方面的成绩中，我们看到内蒙古自治区各族人民与国内各民族人民是真正的得到了共同发展的自由。内蒙古自治区人民的生活现在已经改善了。过去，内蒙古自治区人民吃不饱穿不暖，很多人在夏天还穿着皮袄，女人没有裤子穿的生活，已一去不复返了。由此可以充分证明，中国共产党、毛主席的民族政策是真正能够解决中国民族问题的。
