Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 17th: With the failure of American imperialism in Korea and the growing strength of the Italian people's forces, the demand of a section within the Italian ruling group to break away from the influence of American adventurous policies has become increasingly prominent.

According to a Rome dispatch from Dentsu: "The characteristic of the current development of the Italian domestic political situation is a wide discussion about the need to adopt a new foreign policy, and it is particularly marked by the confusion and contradictions within the Italian government." During the recent discussion of foreign policy in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, Givierre, a member of Saragat's right-wing Socialist Party, put forward a proposal demanding "the adoption of all measures to ease international tensions, support all intentions that contribute to a negotiated settlement of the Korean War, advocate the convening of a four-power conference to resolve the German question, and support a conference of all countries related to Asian issues (including the People's Republic of China)." This proposal was passed by a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. This fact has caused "the US State Department to pay attention to the development of the domestic situation in Italy with distress and suspicion."

The passage of Givierre's proposal aroused dissatisfaction among the extremely pro-American elements in the cabinet. Defense Minister Bazzi threatened the Gasperi government to reject it, otherwise he would withdraw from the cabinet. However, according to Agence France-Presse, the recent development of the Italian political situation is that even the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gronchi, a member of the Christian Democratic Party, demanded at the party's parliamentary group meeting on the 11th of this month that Gasperi "replace Foreign Minister Sforza, Defense Minister Bazzi and Finance Minister Pella," because "these three ministers overly support a policy of increasingly close cooperation with the United States." His request was supported by Giordano, a member of the party. Moreover, according to Agence France-Presse, there are still many people in this Christian Democratic Party who "have recently adopted a position of endorsing a 'appeasement' policy on domestic and international affairs, and strongly support the opinion of convening a four-power conference to quell the current international tensions."

Although under Gasperi's pressure, the Italian Parliament finally approved the government's foreign policy, the demand of the Italian ruling group to break away from American policy is so strong that even Agence France-Presse had to admit: "Gronchi's demands have caused considerable fluctuations in the government."

　　意统治集团一部分人要求摆脱美国的影响
    【新华社十七日讯】随着美国帝国主义在朝鲜的失败和意大利人民力量的日趋强大，意大利统治集团内部一部分人想摆脱美国冒险政策影响的要求已越来越显著。
    据电通社罗马消息：目前“意大利国内政治形势发展的特征是对于有必要采取一个新的外交政策一事的广泛讨论，而且特别是以意大利政府内部的混乱与互相矛盾为其标志”。在意大利议会下院最近讨论外交政策时，萨拉盖特右翼社会党的一个议员吉维亚提出了一个提案，要求“采取一切措施缓和国际紧张形势，支持一切有助于经由谈判解决朝鲜战争的意图，拥护召开解决德国问题的四国会议及拥护一切与亚洲问题有关的国家（包括中华人民共和国）举行会议”。这一提案获得了下院多数通过。这一事实使“美国国务院已经以苦闷与怀疑的心情注意意大利国内形势的发展”。
    吉维亚提案之被通过，曾引起内阁中极端亲美分子的不满。国防部长巴齐亚地并曾威胁加斯贝利政府予以拒绝，否则他就将退出内阁。但是，据法新社透露，意大利政局最近的发展是：连议会下院议长、基督教民主党人格隆齐也在本月十一日该党议会党团会议上要求加斯贝利“撤换外交部长史佛卓、国防部长巴齐亚地和财政部长贝拉”，因为“这三个部长过分支持一个愈益亲密地与美国合作的政策”。他的要求得到了该党议员吉奥旦尼的支持。而且，据法新社称：在这个基督教民主党中，还有不少人“最近在国内事务上和国际事务上都采取赞同‘绥靖’政策的立场，并极力支持召开四强会议以平息目前国际紧张形势的意见”。
    尽管在加斯贝利的压力下，意大利议会最后还是批准了政府的外交政策，但意大利统治集团要求摆脱美国政策的要求是如此强大，甚至法新社也不得不承认：“格隆齐的要求已在政府方面引起了相当大的波动”。
