    Opinions on Publishing New Year Pictures
    To the Editor:
    With the Spring Festival approaching, a large number of New Year pictures have appeared on the market. Our art workers have used this form to reflect the various construction projects and new life situations in New China, which is very good and is a popular form of publicity among the masses. For example, the "Chairman Mao Talking with Farmers," "Returning from the Fair," and New Year pictures about farmers organizing for production after land reform, published by People's Pictorial Publishing House and People's Fine Arts Publishing House, have been well received by the broad masses of the people. However, some New Year pictures still retain the colors of the old New Year pictures and cannot accurately and vividly reflect the situation, and the artistic level is also very poor. For example, the "Military and Political Leaders and Committee Members of the People's Republic of China" published by Shanghai Changchun Picture Company depicts the images of the leaders and some responsible comrades in a way that does not match their true appearance. There are also inappropriate aspects in the color printing. This kind of New Year picture not only fails to achieve the due publicity effect, but also shows a lack of respect for the leaders and an unserious and irresponsible ideological style in art publicity work, let alone any artistic value. Now the level of awareness of the broad masses of the people has been raised, and everyone urgently demands that art workers provide them with higher-quality art works. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will strengthen the inspection and leadership of the publication of New Year pictures.

### 对出版年画的意见

    对出版年画的意见编辑同志：
    春节将到，市面上出现了大批的年画，我们的美术工作者利用这种形式反映了新中国的各种生产建设及新的生活情形，这是很好的，是很受广大群众欢迎的宣传方式。如人民画报社人民美术出版社等所出版的“毛主席和农民谈话”、“赶集归来”及关于土地改革后农民组织起来进行生产的情形等年画，都受到了广大人民的欢迎。但是，还有一部分年画还存在着旧的年画色彩，不能正确的、生动的反映情况，美术水平也很差。如上海市长春画片公司所出版的“中华人民共和国军政领袖委员”其中把领袖和一些负责同志的形象画得与本容不符。印刷套色上也有不恰当的地方。这种年画，非但收不到应有的宣传作用，反而表现了对领袖的不崇敬，对美术宣传工作不严肃和不负责的思想作风，更谈不到什么艺术价值。现在广大人民的觉悟水平都提高了，大家迫切要求美术工作者以更高的美术作品来供给他们。希望有关当局对年画出版工作要加强检查与领导。
