　　Suiyuan Provincial Government Health Bureau
    The Director's Work Style Should Be Investigated
To the Editor:
    Song Youliang (a member of the Chinese Communist Party), the Director of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government Health Bureau, suppresses democracy, promotes or attacks cadres without principle, and is irresponsible in his work. The Suiyuan Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Party Committee have been aware of this situation for at least four or five months, but have not yet taken appropriate action. Now I am reporting his situation to you, hoping you can help solve it.
    (1) Song Youliang suppresses democracy within the Party. For example, Song Youliang used the Health Department's prevention funds for trading, stocking up on a lot of foreign cloth. Geng Shida, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, raised an opinion at a branch committee meeting, saying that when the Health Department needed money, the cloth should be sold to the public. But Song Youliang sold the cloth cheaply to private merchants. Geng Shida raised the issue again at the branch committee meeting, and Song Youliang became furious, scolding Geng for substituting the Party for the government. Other comrades who were attacked for criticizing him include Li Qiu, Yu Kechang, and Zhou Huafang.
    (2) He is unprincipled and acts on personal feelings in his management of cadre policy, engaging in private favoritism. He promotes those who agree with him, such as his fellow villager Suo Huaiyu, whose professional skills are very poor, but Song Youliang promoted him to be the captain of the epidemic prevention team. He attacks and excludes those who offer him opinions. For example, accountant Hong Zhong was fired and sent home because he refused to reimburse Song Youliang's children's nanny for a blank expense claim.
    (3) Song Youliang is irresponsible in his work, causing great losses to the health cause in Suiyuan Province. The Suiyuan Provincial Health Bureau has been established for more than a year, but it has not held a single provincial health work conference (one of the reasons is that Song Youliang knows that many cadres have opinions about him and does not dare to hold a meeting). Every time he goes to a meeting at the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, he does not convey or deploy the information after returning, which affects the implementation of policies and guidelines. Song Youliang arbitrarily used Suiyuan Province's health prevention funds for trading, resulting in a loss of more than seven million yuan, and no preventive work was carried out.
          A Reader
    Editor's Note: Regarding the work style issues of Song Youliang reported by a reader, we have learned through investigation that the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government and the Suiyuan Provincial Party Committee have paid attention to this issue, but have not yet taken appropriate action. It is hoped that this matter will be investigated and dealt with promptly, and the results will be published.

### 绥远省政府卫生局  局长作风应作检查

　　绥远省政府卫生局
    局长作风应作检查编辑同志：
    绥远省人民政府卫生局局长宋友良（中共党员），压制民主，无原则地提拔或打击干部，工作不负责任。绥远省人民政府和中共省委知道他这种情况，至少有四五个月了，但至今未作适当处理。现在我把他的情况反映给你们，希望你们帮助解决。
    （一）宋友良在党内压制民主。如宋友良拿卫生厅的预防事业费来作运销，存了很多洋布；党支部副书记耿世达在一次支委会上提出意见，说卫生厅需要用钱时，应把布卖给公家。但宋友良却把布很便宜地卖给私商了。耿世达又在支委会上提意见，宋友良就大发脾气，骂耿以党代政。其他因向他提出批评而遭到打击的同志有李球、于克昌、周化芳等。
    （二）他在掌握干部政策上是无原则的感情用事，私人拉拢。顺他的他就提拔，如他的老乡索槐玉，业务能力很差，但宋友良却提拔他做防疫大队长。向他提意见的他就打击、排斥。如会计洪忠，因为不给宋友良小孩的保姆报空额，竟被清洗回家。
    （三）宋友良工作不负责任，使绥远省的卫生事业受到很大损失。绥远省卫生局成立一年多，就没开过一次全省卫生工作会议（原因之一是宋友良知道许多干部对他有意见，不敢开会）。他每次到中央人民政府卫生部开会，回来后不传达，不布置，影响了政策方针的贯彻。绥远省的卫生预防事业费，宋友良竟随便用来作运销买卖，结果赔了七百多万元，而未进行预防工作。
          一读者          
    编者按：一读者所反映的宋友良的作风问题，经我们调查，知道绥远省人民政府和中共绥远省委对此问题已予注意，但尚未作适当处理。希望迅速调查处理这件事情，并将结果公布。
