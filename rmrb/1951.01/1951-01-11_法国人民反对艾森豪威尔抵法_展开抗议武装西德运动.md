Xinhua News Agency, January 9th dispatch: Combined TASS Paris dispatches: American warmonger Eisenhower's arrival in Paris has aroused the French people to rise up in an even stronger protest movement against the arming of West Germany. On the day of Eisenhower's arrival in France, countless mass rallies were held by working people in Paris and its suburbs, resolutely opposing the arrival of this aggressive ringleader whom Truman called "Europe's MacArthur". Workers repairing roads in the Tant district of Paris stopped work for an hour to protest. They and the workers at the Gare de l'Est in Paris sent delegations to the American Embassy, declaring that the working people of Paris could not tolerate the appearance of an American general who was rebuilding the West German Nazi army in their city. The working people of Paris are preparing to respond to the call of the "Hotchkiss" factory peace committee for a large-scale patriotic strike and are electing representatives to participate in district and city-wide protest meetings.

The National Standing Committee of the French "Association of Freedom Fighters for Peace" passed a resolution at a two-day meeting in Paris, protesting Eisenhower's arrival, stating: We do not allow a foreign general to come here in peacetime to command our army, "We do not want to see in Europe what happened in Korea. We do not want Paris to suffer the fate of Seoul. We do not need another Oradour in France (note: the location of a large concentration camp during the German occupation of France), we need peace."

Under the pressure of the powerful protest of the people of Paris and all of France, the French government hastily dispatched 6,000 police on the evening of the 6th to enforce strict precautions. Eisenhower, after disembarking on the 7th, was forced to take a detour under heavy police escort due to fear of the anger and excitement of the masses, and many pre-arranged official welcoming events were cancelled. Tonight's weekly magazine wrote: "When Eisenhower arrived, although sirens were blaring and police cars were howling, he actually entered Paris in secret."

Now, the French people's protest movement is unfolding widely. According to a report in L'Humanité: In Douai and its suburbs in the Nord province, 25,000 people have signed the protest against arming West Germany, and 99 percent of the people in the Denain area of the province have signed.

　　法国人民反对艾森豪威尔抵法
    展开抗议武装西德运动
    【新华社九日讯】综合塔斯社巴黎消息：美国战争贩子艾森豪威尔之抵达巴黎，已激起了法国人民奋起反对武装西德的更强大的抗议运动。在艾森豪威尔到达法国的这一天，巴黎市内及郊区的劳动人民，举行了无数起群众大会，坚决反对这个被杜鲁门称之为“欧洲的麦克阿瑟”的侵略头子来临。正在巴黎坦特区修补马路的工人停工一小时，表示抗议。他们和巴黎东车站的工人们都派遣了代表团前往美国大使馆，声明巴黎劳动人民不能容忍一个重建西德纳粹军队的美国将军出现在他们的城市里。巴黎全市劳动人民正准备响应“哈奇开斯”工厂和平委员会的号召，举行大规模爱国罢工，并正选派代表参加各区及全市的抗议大会。
    法国“争和平自由战士协会”全国常设委员会在巴黎举行的为期两日的会议上通过决议，抗议艾森豪威尔的到达称：我们不容许在平时让一个外国将军到这里来统率我国的军队，“我们不愿在欧洲看到在朝鲜所发生的事情。我们不愿巴黎遭到汉城的命运。我们不需要在法国再有一个奥拉德（按为德占领法国时的大集中营所在地），我们需要和平。”
    在巴黎与全法国人民这种强大抗议的威压下，法国政府在六日晚上慌忙地出动了六千名警察严行戒备，而艾森豪威尔于七日下机后，因为害怕群众的愤怒和激动，竟不得不在大批警察护送下绕道而行，许多事先布置好的官方欢迎事宜都被取消。今晚报星期刊描写道：“艾森豪威尔抵达时，虽然警笛高鸣，警车呼啸，然而实际上是秘密进入巴黎的。”
    现在，法国人民的抗议运动正在广泛展开。据人道报消息：在诺尔省的杜埃及其郊区已有二万五千人，该省得南地方已有百分之九十九的人民在反对武装西德的抗议书上签名。
