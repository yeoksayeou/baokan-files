　　Beijing Private Daoji Hospital
    Excessive Charges and Inadequate Care
    Editor's Note: Our newspaper has continuously received criticisms and opinions from readers regarding the excessive charges, inadequate care, and the phenomenon of evading free treatment for the poor at the private Daoji Hospital in Beijing. According to a group of patients in the hospital's third-class tuberculosis ward, the coal and food costs charged by the hospital exceed the actual expenses by more than double. Moreover, the ward's air is polluted, with heavy coal gas, and the poor quality of food has seriously affected the patients' health. However, instead of trying to improve the situation, the hospital has ignored the patients' repeated suggestions. We believe that this irresponsible and uncaring attitude towards patients must be corrected. The fees charged by private hospitals should also have a unified standard and limit; the nutritional supply for patients should reach a reasonable level; and in terms of medical attitude, a spirit of responsibility towards the people must be established. We hope that relevant health administrative authorities will assist Daoji Hospital in conducting inspections and rectifications.

   Editor:
     We are a group of tuberculosis patients living in Daoji Hospital inside Andingmen in this city. We feel that the hospital has extremely unreasonable phenomena in the following issues, which need to be criticized.
    The hospital's charges are high and very unreasonable. Eight people live in the third-class ward, with one stove, and the daily coal requirement is no more than sixty or seventy catties, less than 10,000 yuan. However, the hospital charges each person 3,000 yuan for coal, a total of 24,000 yuan for eight people, more than double the actual cost.
    Compared with the food that patients get, the food costs paid by patients are also excessively high. A patient pays 210,000 yuan per month for food, but the food is very bad. The dishes are one meat dish and one vegetable dish, of poor quality and small quantity. The meat shreds can only be found after careful searching, and the morning millet porridge is pitifully thin. Patients have submitted written opinions three times, but the hospital has not responded. Nutrition is very important for lung disease patients, but the food has not been improved, seriously affecting the patients' recuperation.
    Medicine costs are also often twice as expensive as in pharmacies. Moreover, patients are forced to buy fish liver oil and vitamin pills from the hospital. Even if patients have their own, they must still buy from the hospital.
    The hospital's care for patients is very inadequate. Doctors and nurses live in the best Western-style buildings, with spacious areas, good air and sunshine. This year, a large number of heating equipment has been added. However, the wards are much worse, with crowded beds and polluted air. The coal gas from the stoves makes it difficult to breathe, and patients often feel dizzy and have headaches. There are also often careless attitudes in treatment and nursing, and the patients' opinions are not adopted. Once, when Qi Fengzhang raised opinions to the hospital, Dean Zhang said: "If you don't trust the hospital, you can transfer to another hospital."
    We have many opinions about the above issues. Daoji Hospital should change its strong profit-seeking perspective and serve the people.

   Editor:
    I am a salesman at the Fifth Street Consumer Cooperative in the Third District of Beijing. My family of six relies on my fifty-odd-year-old father pedaling a tricycle and my salary to make a living. A few days ago, unfortunately, my two-month-old baby boy had a cough and diarrhea, and the situation was dangerous. We couldn't sleep all night, and the whole family was anxious. The next day, the police station gave me a letter of introduction to go to Daoji Hospital for free medical treatment. I was very happy and grateful. However, after my wife took the child to Daoji Hospital in heavy snow, the hospital's registration staff said: "Free? Not so fast! I don't know if anyone cares or not?" They did not trust the government's letter of introduction and asked us to bring a household registration booklet. Without a household registration booklet, it wouldn't work. We had to go home. On the 8th, my father and wife went again. The weather was very cold, and they waited in the courtyard for a long time. As a result, the person handling free procedures was not there, and they could not see a doctor again. It's really difficult!
    Why does Daoji Hospital adopt such an attitude towards working people seeking medical treatment? I hope they can have a perspective of serving the people, serve the working people and producers more, and cure one of us is equivalent to increasing the country's production force. This is the opinion of us poor people.

### 北京私立道济医院  收费过重护理不当

　　北京私立道济医院
    收费过重护理不当
    编者按：本报连续地收到了读者对私立道济医院收费过重、护理不当及对待贫苦人民免费治疗推托现象等所提出的批评和意见。据该院三等结核病房一群病员反映，该院所收煤火费和伙食费都超过了实际费用的一倍多，而且由于病房空气污浊，煤气重，加上伙食质量差，已严重地影响了病人的健康。但该院对此非但未设法改进，反而对病人屡次所提之意见置之不理。我们认为这种对病人不负责任和不关心的不良作风必须纠正。私立医院所收费用亦应有统一的标准和限度；对于病人的营养供给则应达到合理的程度；在医疗态度上，必须树立对人民负责的精神。希有关卫生行政机关，协助道济医院进行检查和整顿。      
   编辑同志：
     我们是一群结核病患者，住在本市安定门内道济医院，我们觉得院方在以下问题上存在着极不合理的现象，需要提出批评。
    该院收费重而且很不合理。三等病房里住着八个人，生着一个火炉子，每天需煤最多不超过六、七十斤，不到一万元。但是院方向每人收煤火费三千元，八人共二万四千元，超过一倍多。
    病人拿的伙食费和吃的饭比起来，也存在着收费过高的现象。一个病人每月伙食费二十一万元，但吃的非常坏，菜是一荤一素，质差量少，肉丝是要仔细找才看得到的，早上的小米粥更是稀得可怜。病人对此曾提过三次书面意见，院方均不予答复。营养对肺病患者是很重要的，但伙食迄未改善，严重地影响着病人的休养。
    药费也往往比药房里贵一倍。并且强迫病人买医院中的鱼肝油、维他命丸。病人虽有自己带来的也一定要买。
    该院对病人的照顾是很不够的。大夫、护士住的是最好的洋楼，地方宽敞，空气、阳光都很好，今年又大批增置暖气设备；但病房就差得很多，床位拥挤，空气污浊，生了炉子煤气更是重得呼吸困难，病人经常感到头晕脑胀。在治疗、护理方面也常有粗枝大叶的作风，而且对病人的意见不采纳。有一次齐凤章向医院提意见时，张院长表示：如果你不信任医院，尽可以转到别的医院去。
    对于以上问题，我们是很有意见的。道济医院应该改变浓厚的营利观点，为人民服务。
                            一群读者编辑同志：
    我是京市第三区五街消费合作社的业务员，全家共六口人，依靠五十余岁的老父亲蹬三轮和我的薪金维持生活。前些天，不幸我的两个月的小男孩咳嗽、泻肚，情形危险，彻夜不得安眠，全家人心焦急。次日，由派出所给我开了介绍信去道济医院免费看病，我非常高兴和感激。可是，下着大雪我妻子抱着孩子跑到道济医院后，该院挂号人员说：“免费？早着呢！还不知有人管没人管呢？”他们不信任政府的介绍信，让我们拿户口单去，没有户口单不行。我们只好回家了。八日，我父亲和妻子又去，非常冷的天气，在院子里等了好久，结果办理免费手续的人不在，又没能看病，真难啊！
    道济医院怎么对于劳苦群众看病采取这样的态度呢？我希望他们能有为人民服务的观点，多为劳动人民和生产者服务，替我们治好一个人，就等于增加国家一份生产力量。这是我们穷人的意见。
