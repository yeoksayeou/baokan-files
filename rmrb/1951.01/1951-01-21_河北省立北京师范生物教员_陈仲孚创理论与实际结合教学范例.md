Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: Chen Zhongfu, a biology teacher at Hebei Provincial Beijing Normal School, spares no effort in collecting various plant and animal materials in his spare time to make specimens as teaching materials, setting a teaching example that combines theory and practice.

When the school moved back to Beijing from Gansu in 1947, the school's facilities were very poor, especially in science, where experimental equipment and specimens were almost completely lacking. After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government increased funding for the school, enabling various facilities to be added one after another, and a lot of scientific instruments were added. Last summer, a building was built for use as a biology laboratory. Chen Zhongfu, a biology teacher, changed his old employment concept under the new education policy of the People's Government. He knew that to teach biology well, he had to solve the problem of the school's lack of specimens. Therefore, starting in August of the year before last, he began to collect various rare plants and animals everywhere and make his own specimens. By the end of last year, he had made more than 60 kinds of plant specimens, more than 50 kinds of animal specimens, and dozens of fruit and seed specimens. In addition, he also planted 50 grape plants and 50 sweet potato seedlings.

When he taught that tapeworms parasitize the human body, students often doubted the possibility that such large worms could grow in the human body. Therefore, he was determined to make tapeworm specimens. After seven or eight months of effort, he personally examined the feces of more than 70 students and workers and found tapeworms in two people. He immediately used a very simple prescription - betel nut water - to expel the tapeworms, one of which was as long as twelve feet, and all were made into specimens. In order to enable students to understand the source of tapeworms more thoroughly, he went everywhere to find pork with rice-like lesions (pork with tapeworm cysts parasitized in it). In September of last year, he finally found it and made it into a specimen. He used this vivid and practical example as teaching material and achieved great results in teaching.

Chen Zhongfu's new teaching attitude and the new teaching paradigm he created have been valued by the school's principal, Cheng Hansan. Chen Zhongfu has written his experience into an article entitled "An Example of Connecting Theory with Practice in Teaching Biology," which was published in the first issue of the third volume of "Hebei Education." Principal Cheng Hansan also asked the school's trade union to help Chen Zhongfu organize relevant materials and compile them into a book, so as to better promote this practice and experience.

　　河北省立北京师范生物教员
    陈仲孚创理论与实际结合教学范例
    【新华社十七日讯】河北省立北京师范学校生物教员陈仲孚，在课余不避艰苦地搜集各种动植物材料，制成标本，作为教材，树立了理论与实际相结合的教学范例。
    该校在一九四七年从甘肃迁回北京，校内设备很差，尤其理科方面，实验仪器和标本的设备几乎完全没有。北京解放后，人民政府给该校增拨了经费，使校内各种设备都陆续增添起来，理科的仪器添置了不少。去年夏天还盖起一座楼房，做为生物实验室用。生物教员陈仲孚在人民政府的新的教育方针下改变了旧的雇佣观点。他知道要把生物学教好，必须解决学校缺乏标本的问题：于是从前年八月起，他便到处搜罗各种难得的动植物，自己浸制标本。截至去年年底，他一共制成了植物标本六十多种，动物标本五十多种，果实种子标本也搜集了好几十种。另外，他还种了五十株葡萄，五十株甘薯苗。
    在他教到人体内有绦虫寄生时，学生常怀疑人的身体内有生长这样大虫子的可能。于是他决心制造绦虫标本。他曾经过七、八个月的努力，亲自检验了七十多个学生和工友的粪便，发现了两个人体内有绦虫，当即用极简便的药方——槟榔水，把绦虫打下来，其中有一条长达一丈二尺，都制成了标本。为了使学生更透彻地了解绦虫的来源，他又到处去找米心猪肉（有绦虫囊胞寄生的猪肉，成米粒状）。在去年九月终于被他找到，并制成标本。他以这种生动实际的事例作为教材，在教学上获得了很大的效果。
    陈仲孚的这种新的教学态度和他所创造的新的教学范例，受到了该校校长成汉三的重视。陈仲孚已把他的经验写成文章题为“教生物学联系实际的一个例子”，在“河北教育”三卷一期上发表。成汉三校长并请该校工会帮助陈仲孚整理有关材料编写成册，以便把这种作法和经验更好的推广。
