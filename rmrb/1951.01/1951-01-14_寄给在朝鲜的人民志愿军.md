To the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea
    Ding Ling
    I have seen exquisitely crafted jade and agate, precious stones that record the hard work of the laboring people. I have also seen brocade and satin, beautiful fabrics that tell us of the wisdom of the laboring people. But your names are more precious than anything, more beautiful than anything, because they signify truth, signify the great spirit of sacrificing everything for truth. When people see the words "Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea," a solemn and sacred feeling wells up in their hearts. You are doing what humanity most hopes to do; you are fighting the common enemy of mankind, American imperialism, for the sake of the motherland, for the integrity and construction of a beautiful new China, for world peace, and for the happiness of future generations. People's Volunteer Army! You will complete the most glorious and important chapter in the history of the world's working people. Your hardships, your wisdom, and your courage will be praised by peace-loving people all over the world. You are the model for all generations to come.
    Where do you come from? From Mao Zedong's China, from beside the machines, taking off your greasy work clothes and putting on the battle robes of the expedition. In the factories, you were labor models; you once set new labor records for the country's industrial construction. But when you heard American imperialism extending its cannons to the Yalu River, you immediately picked up the guns of justice with your pliers-wielding hands and went to Korea to defend the motherland, to defend the motherland's industrial construction!
    You, the farming peasants, participated in the great land reform, fought against the Chinese feudal landlord class, and eliminated the age-old feudal exploitation system. You stood up, gained land, gained cattle and sheep; you were not willing to enjoy it yourselves, but worked even harder. You often saved money and food, contributing surplus grain to the motherland to support the war of independence and liberation. Now, you hear that the Korean people are again being bullied by imperialism, that the brutal MacArthur is even more savage and crazy than the Japanese emperor. You cannot bear it; you wiped the mud from your hands, signed your names on the volunteer forms, bid farewell to the land you cultivate, and went to fight for the fraternal Korean people in distress.
    And you, the glorious revolutionary soldiers! You have experienced the trials and tribulations of war, but when you heard that the United States, together with Rhee Syngman of Korea, was making a mess of Korea again, you thought of the brothers who fought alongside you—the Korean people who shared snow, swam the Yangtze River, climbed high mountains, and captured cannons, tanks, and machine guns with you for the liberation of China. You want to drive MacArthur away with them. You asked to join the volunteer army, to protect your homes and defend the country, and for the sake of brothers who share weal and woe and destiny, you crossed the Yalu River again.
    Where do you come from? From all walks of life. In schools, young people bit their fingers and wrote their enlistment vows in blood. You have not experienced anything yet, but the first principle you understand is to oppose aggressive imperialism. You understand what to do and you do it without hesitation.
    Work teams went to the front lines, and medical teams followed. You—my old friend Li Lanting! I saw you two months ago at the Heroic Models Conference. I know your health; you broke a rib while rescuing the wounded on the East China battlefield, and you are so small. When we were in Budapest, no foreign friend would have thought you were over sixteen years old, and everyone was amazed at your heroic deeds. Now you are at the front again, you small but great, never-retreating volunteer! Do you know how proud I am to have you as a friend!
    We cheered you on, in factories, in the countryside, in the army, in schools, in government offices, we embraced you with hearts as hot as fire, we looked at you with moist eyes, we expressed our respect for you with firm handshakes. We sent you to the station, to the ten-mile pavilion. We couldn't finish the words in our hearts, but it didn't matter. We all understood each other; we have the same thoughts, we are doing the same thing, we also want to go with you, we also signed up, we are your reserve army, the entire Chinese people are of one mind. We wish you victory, we wish the Korean people victory, we wish the world eternal peace under our efforts!
    You crossed the bombed Yalu River, you arrived in the destroyed Korean cities and villages. The houses were all collapsed, a pile of rubble. You saw the Korean people. They have no homes, everything was burned by the American imperialist incendiary bombs. They are still wearing single layers of clothing, but they welcomed you, poured out their suffering to you, and wanted to work with you to recover the land occupied and humiliated by American imperialism. The Korean people have the same tenacious qualities as us. Although you are in Korea, it is like being in China; the people and the army are one family.
    You met the Korean People's Army; they liberated Inchon and liberated Seoul. They are young, they are brave, they have General Kim Il-sung. They also embraced you with hearts as hot as fire, looked at you with moist eyes, and expressed infinite closeness with firm handshakes. You live together in the mountains, live together underground, quench your thirst with snow, and eat the same dry rations. There have been all kinds of wars in the world, but no one has been as tough as you. When you recall the cruel anti-Japanese war against the sweeping-up operations, you find it quite ordinary in comparison.
    The American imperialist riffraff dare not fight hard battles; they are afraid of you, so they have to use countless planes to bomb the Korean land with bombs cast from the blood and sweat of the American people. They want to bomb Mount Paektu into flat ground, so that there are no roads and no smoke can rise. From night to day, from day to night, hundreds of planes, seeing a house that can be hidden, a grass field that can be hidden, will bomb and burn it. They think that as long as they have money, as long as they have planes and bombs, they can conquer everything. They tell the soldiers that when they encounter danger, they can completely discard their weapons, as long as they save their lives and escape back, there are plenty of tanks and cannons.
    But as soon as you arrived in Korea, you wiped out a large number of them. In the Battle of Yunshan, more than 10,000 American and Rhee Syngman bandit troops were annihilated. You released prisoners once and then released them again. They secretly hid the prisoners and dared not let them meet the reporters. The prisoners said that your way of fighting is rare in the world, attacking from the front and attacking from the rear, with your attacks on the left and on the right. Although the legs of us Americans are long, we can only kneel down and surrender. People who came back from the front told us what the Americans looked like when they surrendered: how could we restrain our laughter? Truman cannot use "rather die than surrender" to mobilize his invading army, because how can he say "The American people should shed blood and die for our monopoly capitalists, for the Wall Street tycoons, arms dealers, for the Marshall Plan, for our occupation of the whole world, to invade Korea, attack China, oppose the Soviet Union, and oppose world peace." So MacArthur can only deceive his soldiers, "We will quickly end the war, I will let you return to America, return to your wives to spend Christmas together!"
    MacArthur is like a mad dog; he believes too much in his own bluster. He did not learn a lesson from the failure of the United States to support Chiang Kai-shek. He did not care about what Chairman Mao once said: "The Chinese people are invincible." He looked down on the Chinese people too much. He once again launched an "offensive to end the war." He wanted to be able to win the capital for Dulles, Acheson, Rusk, and Chiang Kai-shek's little puppy Chiang Tingfu to do business with when our Wu Xiuquan arrived at Success Lake. But he was too wishful thinking! On the second day of his offensive, he encountered the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people. These troops seemed to have fallen from the sky and emerged from the ground. They could not figure out how many there were. Their cannons lost their effectiveness, their planes lost their effectiveness, and they obeyed the orders of their generals, discarding everything and only caring about escaping. They resented MacArthur: "Those were clearly lies, even if the war ends, how can those who have no planes to ride return to America to spend Christmas?"
    Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea! The whole world is watching you, listening to your news on the radio every day, reading your news in the newspapers, and looking for your whereabouts on the map. When the wind blows, we think of you; when the snow falls, we think of you; when night comes, we think of you; when we pick up our rice bowls, we think of you. People in pain think of you, and happy people also think of you.
    Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea! You are like a giant star, hanging in the high sky on a cold night, you are like a fire, burning in the wilderness. You are entirely the embodiment of heroes, like a statue, standing in people's hearts, admired by people, you are the embodiment of ideals, summoning people to be longed for forever!
    Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea! The old white-haired grandmothers are also sewing clothes for you, sewing all their life's experiences on them, wanting you to remember the suffering of this era. Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea! Fifteen-year-old girls are also sewing comfort bags for you, embroidering their youth, their future, happiness, and fantasies on them, wanting you to remember that all your hardships are for the next generation!
    I have too much to say to you, the manuscript cannot be finished, the publications cannot be published completely, the tape recorder cannot record completely, and you do not have time to read, do not have time to listen, I have to save it. Well, let me tell you later, now I can only extend my hand, hold you tightly, stare at you in the air, and say the most precious, most beautiful, and most sublime name in the world, Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea! We all understand each other, we are working on the same thing, I also want to go to Korea, I also signed up, I am your reserve army, I wish you victory, I wish the Korean people victory, I wish the world will always have peace under our efforts!
                               November 30, 1950, Beijing

　　寄给在朝鲜的人民志愿军
    丁玲
    我曾看见经过巧匠雕琢的碧玉和玛瑙，它是珍贵的，它记载着劳动人民的辛劳。我也见过锦绣彩缎，它是美丽的，它告诉了我们劳动人民的智慧。可是你们的名字比一切都珍贵，比一切都美丽，因为它标志着真理，标志着为真理牺牲一切的伟大气派。当人们看见中国人民抗美援朝志愿军这几个字的时候，心里就涌起了一种庄严神圣的感觉。你们正在做着人类极希望做的事，你们是为祖国，美好的新中国的完整与建设，为世界的和平，为后代子孙的幸福而与人类的公敌美帝国主义作战。人民志愿军呵！你们将完成世界劳动人民最辉煌，最重要的一段历史，你们的艰苦，你们的智慧和你们的勇敢，为全世界酷爱和平的人民所歌颂，你们是万世子孙的楷模。
    你们从那里来？从毛泽东的中国来，从马达旁边，脱下了油污的工衣，穿上出征的战袍。你们在工厂里，是劳动模范，你们曾经为祖国的工业建设创下劳动新纪录。但当你们听见美帝国主义把大炮伸向鸭绿江边，你们就立刻用拿钳子的手扛起正义的枪，为保卫祖国，为保卫祖国的工业建设，而走向朝鲜了！
    你们种地的农民，你们曾参加过伟大的土地改革，和中国的封建地主阶级斗争，消灭了亘古以来的封建剥削制度。你们翻了身，获得了土地，获得了牛羊，你们并不愿自己享受，却更加辛勤。你们经常是省吃俭用，把余粮贡献给祖国，支援独立解放的战争。如今，你们听到朝鲜人民，又受到帝国主义的欺凌，残暴的麦克阿瑟，比日本的天皇还要野蛮与疯狂，你们不能忍受，你们擦去了手上的泥土，在志愿书上签了名，别了你们耕耘的土地，去为兄弟民族，受难的朝鲜人民而战。
    还有革命的光荣战士们！你们经历过战争的千锤百炼，千辛万苦，可是你们一听到美国又伴同朝鲜的李承晚，把朝鲜折腾得不像样子，你们就想起和你们并肩作战过的兄弟——朝鲜人民为了中国的解放，和你们一道啃过雪，一道浮游长江，一道爬过高山，一道缴获大炮、坦克机枪，你们要和他们一道，把麦克阿瑟赶跑。你们要求去参加志愿部队，为了保家卫国，为了共患难、同命运的兄弟，你们又渡过了鸭绿江。
    你们从那里来？从各个工作岗位上。在学校里，青年们咬破了手指，用血写下参军的志愿。你们还什么也没有经历，你们最先明白的道理，是反对侵略的帝国主义，你们明白什么，就去做什么，决不迟疑。
    工作队上了前方，医疗队也跟了上去，你—我的老朋友李兰丁呵！两月前在英模大会上我还见到你，你的身体我是知道的，你在华东战场的时候，为了抢救伤员，就断了一根肋骨，你的个子是那样的小。我们在布达佩斯时，没有一个外国朋友会以为你过了十六岁，谁也惊奇你的英勇事迹。现在你又走在前头，你这小小的，却是伟大的永不退后的志愿兵呵！你知道么，我是多么以为我有你这样一个朋友为光荣呵！
    我们欢送过你们，在工厂、在农村、在部队，在学校，在机关，我们用火一样热的心，拥抱过你们，用潮湿的眼望过你们，用紧紧地握手，表示对你们的尊敬，我们送你们上车站，送你们到十里长亭。说不完心中的话，其实不说也不要紧，我们谁也清楚谁，我们是一样的心思，我们做的是一件事，我们也要同你们一道去，我们也签了名，我们是你们的后备军，中国人民全是一条心。祝你们胜利，祝朝鲜人民胜利，祝世界在我们的努力之下永远得到和平！
    你们渡过了炮轰过的鸭绿江，你们到了被炸毁的朝鲜城市和乡村。房屋全坍了，一片瓦砾，你们看见了朝鲜人民。他们没有了家，他们什么也被美帝国主义的烧夷弹烧了，他们还穿着单衣，但是他们招待了你们，把痛苦向你们倾诉，他们要同你们一道把被美帝侵占了侮辱了的土地收回。朝鲜人民有我们一样坚苦不拔的品质。你们虽说是在朝鲜也像在中国一样，人民和军队就是一家。
    你们见到了朝鲜的人民军；他们解放过仁川，解放过汉城。他们年青，他们英勇，他们有金日成将军。他们也用火一样的心拥抱你们，用潮湿的眼望你们，用紧紧地握手表示和你们有无限亲近。你们一同住在山上，一同住在地下，一同啃雪解渴，吃一样的干粮。世界上什么战争都有过，谁也没有你们那样坚苦，你们回想起那残酷的抗日战争反扫荡，比较起来又觉得太平常。
    美帝国主义的虾兵蟹将，不敢打硬仗，他们害怕你们，只好用无数飞机，把美国人民血汗铸成的炸弹在朝鲜的国土上炸遍。他们想把白头山炸成平地，要道路没有，烟火无法升起，他们从夜到日，从日到夜，几百架飞机，看见有一点可以隐避的房屋，一片可以隐避的草地，就轰炸燃烧，他们以为只要有钱，只要有飞机和炸弹，就可以征服一切，他们向兵士说，遇到危险时，武器完全可以丢掉，只要留住性命逃回来，有的是坦克大炮。
    可是你们一到朝鲜，就把他们吃了一片。云山一仗，消灭了美李匪军一万多，你们释放了一次俘虏又释放了一次，他们把俘虏秘密起来不敢让他们和记者见面。俘虏们说，你们打仗的方法世界上少有，前面打来后面也打来，左边有你们的攻击，右边也有。我们美国人的腿虽然长，却只能跪下来投降。从前面回来的人告诉我们美国人投降的样子：我们怎能忍住我们的笑声，杜鲁门是不能用“宁死不投降”来动员他的侵略军的，因为他怎么能说“美国人民应该为了我们垄断资本家们，为了华尔街的财主，军火商人，为了马歇尔计划，为了我们霸占全世界，去侵占朝鲜，进攻中国，反对苏联，反对世界和平去流血，去死。”所以麦克阿瑟只能骗他们士兵，“我们要赶快结束战争，我会让你们回到美国，回到你们妻子身旁一道过圣诞节！”
    麦克阿瑟像一条疯狗，他太相信他自己的叫嚣了，他一点也没有在美国扶持蒋介石的失败中，取得教训。他一点也不介意毛主席曾经说过的话：“中国人民是无敌的，”他太瞧不起中国人了。他又一次地发动“结束战争的进攻”，他想当我们的伍修权到成功湖时，他能为杜勒斯，为艾奇逊，为赖伊，为蒋介石的小叭儿狗蒋廷黻赢得做买卖的无赖的谈话的资本。可是，他太一相情愿了！他进攻的第二天，就碰到了中国人民志愿军，碰到了朝鲜人民，这些军队好像从天上掉下来的一样，从地下钻出来的一样，他们摸不清有多少。他们的大炮失了效用，飞机失了效用，他们依照着将军们的命令，什么都丢掉，只顾逃命。他们怨恨麦克阿瑟：“你们那明明是谎话，纵使结束了战争，没有飞机坐的还能回美国去过圣诞节？”
    中国人民抗美援朝志愿军呵！全世界都在望着你们，每天在收音机旁听你们的消息，在报纸上看你们的消息，在地图上寻找你们的行踪。当风吹来时，想着你，当雪飘来时，想着你，当夜晚来临时，想着你，当拿起饭碗时想起了你。痛苦的人们想起你，幸福的人们也想着你。
    中国人民抗美援朝志愿军呵！你们像一颗巨星，悬在寒夜的高空，你们像一团火，燃烧在旷野上。你们整个是英雄的化身，像一尊塑像，屹立在人们心中，被人们景仰，你们是理想的化身，召唤着人们永远被人们向往！
    中国人民抗美援朝志愿军呵！白发的老婆婆，也在为你们缝衣裳，把她们一生的遭遇都缀在那上边，要你们记住，这个时代的苦难。中国人民抗美援朝志愿军呵！十五岁姑娘也在为你们缝慰问袋，把她们的青春，她们的前途，幸福和幻想都绣在那上边，要你们记住，你们一切的艰苦都是为了后一代！
    我要同你们说的话太多了，稿子写不完，刊物登不完，录音机记录不完，而且你们没有时间看，没有时间听，我得节省下来，那末，好吧，让我以后再告诉你们，我现在只能伸长我的手，紧握着你们，在空中凝视着你们，念着世界上最珍贵最美丽最崇高的名字，中国人民抗美援朝志愿军呵！我们是谁也清楚谁的，我们努力的是一件事，我也要到朝鲜去，我也签了名，我是你们的后备军，我祝你们胜利，祝朝鲜人民的胜利，祝世界在我们努力之下，永远得到和平！
