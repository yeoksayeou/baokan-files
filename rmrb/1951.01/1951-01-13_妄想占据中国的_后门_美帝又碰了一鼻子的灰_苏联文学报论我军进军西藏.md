　　Dreaming of Occupying China's "Back Door"
    US Imperialism Gets Another Bloody Nose
    Soviet Literary Gazette on Our Army's Advance into Tibet
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th] The Soviet Literary Gazette published an article on the 9th, commenting on the Chinese People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet and published four photos showing the Chinese People's Liberation Army overcoming high mountains and great rivers, Tibetan Lamas welcoming the People's Liberation Army, and PLA doctors treating Tibetan compatriots. The commentary stated: The Chinese People's Liberation Army bravely advanced into Tibet in October 1950 to liberate the Tibetan people from the shackles of American and British imperialists and local feudal reactionary forces in order to complete China's unification and ensure the security of the southwestern border. The People's Liberation Army was warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people. The commentary continued: After the great victory of the Chinese revolution, American and British imperialists still vainly attempted to control Tibet, seize Tibet's natural resources, and use it as a base to plot aggression against the new China and other Asian countries. American spies in Tibet had long considered Tibet to be an ideal "aircraft carrier." People in the Pentagon (referring to the location of the US Department of Defense) called Tibet China's "back door," Korea China's "front door," and Vietnam China's "side door." American and British imperialists charged headlong at these doors. The commentary sarcastically said: Now that the "front door" and "side door" have been tightly closed, the imperialists' frantic attempt to occupy the "back door" has also gotten them a bloody nose.

　　妄想占据中国的“后门”
    美帝又碰了一鼻子的灰   
    苏联文学报论我军进军西藏
    【新华社莫斯科十一日电】苏联文学报九日刊登论文，评论中国人民解放军进军西藏，并刊出四张照片，内容是中国人民解放军克服高山大水，西藏喇嘛欢迎解放军，及解放军医士给藏胞治病的情况。该评论称：中国人民解放军于一九五○年十月向西藏英勇进军，把西藏人民由美英帝国主义者及当地封建反动势力的枷锁中解放出来，以便完成中国的统一并保障西南边疆的安全。人民解放军受到西藏人民的热烈欢迎。评论继称：美英帝国主义者在中国革命获得了伟大的胜利之后，仍枉费心机地企图把持西藏，控制西藏的天然富源，并想据以作为阴谋侵略新中国和亚洲其他国家的基地。美国在西藏的间谍们早就认为西藏是理想的“航空母舰”。五角大楼（按系美国国防部所在地）的人们称西藏为中国的“后门”，朝鲜为中国的“前门”，越南为中国的“侧门”。美英帝国主义者就向这些门户横冲直闯。评论讽刺地说：现在“前门”和“侧门”已经紧紧关住了，帝国主义者狂怒下妄想占据“后门”的企图，也已碰了一鼻子的灰。
