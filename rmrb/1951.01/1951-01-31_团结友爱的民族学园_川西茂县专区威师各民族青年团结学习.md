　　A United and Fraternal National Academy
　　——The United Study of Youth from Various Ethnic Groups at the Weishi School in the Maoxian Special District, Western Sichuan
　　The Maoxian Special District in Western Sichuan is inhabited by five or six ethnic groups with seven or eight different languages. In the past, under the Kuomintang's Great Han chauvinist reactionary rule, minority brothers were subjected to insults and contempt in schools. The old reactionary education tried every means to destroy the languages ​​and cultures of minority nationalities. When the Qiang ethnic group's Su Shimin was studying at the Weishi School, he was laughed at for speaking his ethnic language as being "uncivilized," and in recent years he has forgotten how to speak his own ethnic language.
　　The situation is completely different after liberation. Because the People's Government has correctly implemented the ethnic policies and cultural and educational policies in the Common Program, the social status of minority nationalities has improved, and they have also had the opportunity to study. In the past year, the number of minority students at Weishi School has greatly increased, and there are currently 36 students, accounting for one-quarter of the total number of students in the school. Weishi School has specially opened a remedial class to help minority students make up their lessons so that they can catch up with the regular classes. Such care has won warm praise and gratitude from minority students. Their learning enthusiasm is very high, and they all expressed: "The People's Government is so good to us, we must study hard." They actively participate in various activities in the school. When evaluating People's Stipends, they all voluntarily lowered their benefits to help other poorer students. At the same time, when donating winter clothes, other students also donated to help minority students make cotton clothes. In this way, an unprecedented atmosphere of unity and harmony has formed in the school. The level of consciousness of minority students has improved rapidly. In every social activity, they have played a great role in explaining the policies and laws of the Central People's Government in minority areas. After the news of the Military Cadre School enrollment came, minority students showed a high degree of patriotism. Students such as Liu Zongwen and Tao Chaoyang signed up to take the military cadre school entrance examination to serve the motherland. The sons and daughters of all ethnic groups at Weishi School are advancing by leaps and bounds in united study.

　　团结友爱的民族学园 
    ——川西茂县专区威师各民族青年团结学习
    川西茂县专区，居住着五、六种民族，有七、八种不同的语言。过去，在国民党的大汉族主义反动统治下，少数民族弟兄，在学校里也是受着侮辱和卑视。旧的反动教育想尽一切办法来摧残少数民族的语言文化。羌族苏士民在威师学校读书时，因为说民族语言被人耻笑为“不开化”，这几年来已不会讲自己民族的话了。
    解放后完全是另一情况。由于人民政府正确地执行了共同纲领中的民族政策和文化教育政策，少数民族社会地位提高了，同样有了求学的机会。一年来威师学校少数民族学生大为增加，目前已有三十六人，占全校学生总数的四分之一。威师学校专门开设了一个补习班，帮助少数民族学生补习功课，使他们能赶上正课。这样的照顾获得了少数民族学生的热烈称赞和感谢。他们的学习情绪非常高涨，并一致表示：“人民政府对我们这样好，我们一定要好好学习。”学校中的各种活动他们都积极参加。评人民助学金时，他们都自动把待遇降低，以帮助其他较贫苦的同学。同时，在捐募寒衣时，其他学生也都纷纷捐献帮助少数民族同学做棉衣。这样，在学校里形成了空前未有的团结和蔼的气氛。少数民族学生的觉悟程度进步得很快，在每次社会活动中，他们在少数民族地区，讲解中央人民政府的政策法令，都起了很大作用。军干校招生的消息传来后，少数民族同学表现了高度热爱祖国的精神，刘宗文、陶朝阳等同学都报名投考军事干校，为祖国效劳。威师学校各民族的儿女们，在团结学习中大踏步前进。
