　　Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 9th. According to TASS, "Crossroads" published the resolution passed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India on the Communist Party of India's participation in the upcoming Indian parliamentary elections. The resolution stated: Although the "Indian National Congress" party (the ruling party of India) has promised to implement universal suffrage for all adult residents, until now, the party has not been determined to implement such elections and continues to postpone them. The Indian National Congress itself understands that the masses' hatred of its rule has reached its peak. The Indian National Congress's promise to implement universal suffrage is nothing more than a means of deceiving the people and covering up the terror and suppression of the people's movement. This trick of the "Indian National Congress" party should be completely exposed, and every effort must be made to break this scheme. The people should unite and demand the immediate implementation of universal suffrage. It must be pointed out that if elections are held when the Communist Party of India and other progressive organizations have been banned in some provinces and have been practically banned in other places, when tens of thousands of political activists are imprisoned, when newspapers have been banned, and when a large part of our country has in fact abolished the rights of association, assembly, and parades, then such elections would be nothing more than a mockery of democracy. A strong movement to fully restore all civil liberties should be launched together with those who defend democratic rights and freedoms. A program of minimum demands should be formulated, and the basic slogan should be: the current government should step down and give way to a government that represents democratic forces and guarantees the realization of this minimum program. The Communist Party of India is willing to make every effort to reach an agreement with various left-wing parties and all progressives to mobilize the masses most widely to fight against the current government and strive for freedom, peace, democracy, and land reform.

　　印共发表关于议会选举的决议
    号召印度人民团结起来要求政府立即实行普选
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社德里讯：“十字路报”发表印度共产党中央委员会全体会议所通过的关于印度共产党参加即将来临的印度议会选举的决议。决议说：尽管“印度国民大会”党（印度执政党）曾允诺将实行全体成年居民都可参加的普选，可是直到现在为止，该党并没有决心实行这样的选举而继续把选举拖延下去。印度国大党自己明白：群众对它的统治的憎恨已达极点。关于实行普选的选举印度国民大会的诺言，不过是欺骗人民和掩饰对人民运动的恐怖镇压的手段而已。“印度国民大会”党的这种把戏，应该完全予以揭穿，并且必须竭尽全力来打破这种计谋。人民应该团结起来，要求立即实行普选。必须指出，如果当印度共产党以及其他进步组织在某些省份已被取缔，在其他地方也已实际遭受取缔的时候，当数以万计的政治工作者被囚禁在监狱里的时候，当报纸已被查禁的时候，当我国一大部分地区事实上已取消了结社、集会、游行等等权利的时候，在这样的时候实行选举，那么这种选举就不过是对民主开玩笑而已。必须与那些维护民主权利和自由的人们共同开始争取完全恢复一切公民自由的强有力的运动。应该制订最低要求的纲领，而基本口号应该是：现政府应该走开，应该让位给代表民主力量和保证实现这种最低纲领的政府。印度共产党愿竭力与各左翼政党及一切进步分子取得协议，以最广泛地动员群众，来进行反对现政府、争取自由、和平、民主及土地改革的斗争。
