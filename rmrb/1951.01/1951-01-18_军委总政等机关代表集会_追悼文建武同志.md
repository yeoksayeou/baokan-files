　　[This newspaper reports] The General Political Department and the General Cadre Management Department of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission held a memorial meeting yesterday (the 17th) to mourn Comrade Wen Jianwu, former Deputy Commander of the 21st Army Corps, who died of illness. Representatives from the various directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, the Central South Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and representatives from various units stationed in the capital attended the memorial meeting. The memorial meeting was held at 1:30 PM in the auditorium of the General Political Department of the Military Commission. Zhang Jingwu, Director of the General Office of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission, delivered a eulogy, stating: "Comrade Wen Jianwu was a good member of the Communist Party of China and a good cadre of the People's Liberation Army. It is deeply regrettable that he passed away due to illness at a time when the Party and the people needed him even more." He then called on everyone to learn from Comrade Wen Jianwu's excellent revolutionary qualities of being loyal to the cause of the Party and the people for more than 20 years, and to contribute their strength even better to the revolutionary cause; especially at a time when American imperialism is expanding its aggression, to strengthen the construction of a modern national defense force and be ready at any time to crush any aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism. This was followed by the presentation of wreaths by Comrade Wen Jianwu's two young daughters. The memorial meeting ended at 3:30 PM. The remains were then moved to the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery in the western suburbs of Beijing for burial.
　　Comrade Wen Jianwu was a native of Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, born into a poor peasant family. In 1928, at the age of seventeen, he participated in the Eyuwan Revolutionary Uprising. In 1930, he joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and in 1931, he joined the Communist Party of China. During the Red Army era, he served as Director of Staff of a Division, Director of Staff of an Army, and Minister of the General Logistics Station of the Fourth Front Army. After the Anti-Japanese War, he served as Section Chief, Political Commissar of a Brigade, Chief of Staff of a Division, Commander of a Column, and Deputy Commander of a Provincial Military Region. In January 1950, he was transferred to the post of Deputy Commander of the 21st Army Corps. In his work, he demonstrated boundless loyalty, perseverance, humility, and prudence towards the Party and the people's revolutionary cause. In the long revolutionary struggle, he suffered from overwork and developed a malignant tumor of the pancreas, which was incurable. He passed away at 8:15 AM on January 15, 1951, at Beijing Hospital, at the young age of thirty-nine.
