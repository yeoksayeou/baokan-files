Xinhua News Agency, January 5th, via Telepress, Rangoon, January 3rd: The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army has issued a communique stating that, in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the nationwide resistance war in Vietnam and the sixth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army, the People's Army launched offensives in the Eastern and Central North Vietnam war zones from December 26th to 29th, 1950. The communique stated that in this campaign, three battalions and two companies of French troops were annihilated, 1,100 French troops were killed or wounded, 700 were captured, and a large quantity of weapons and ammunition were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd, TASS, Paris, January 1st: *L'Humanité* reports that the Vietnamese People's Army is continuing large-scale battles against the French Expeditionary Force in the area of the Xian An Fortress, the main stronghold of the French Expeditionary Force in the northeast of Tonkin (North Vietnam). The paper stated that fierce battles are taking place along the defense line north of Hanoi. Many large strongholds established by the French Expeditionary Force in the area are under continuous attack by the Vietnamese People's Army.

Another report from the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, January 1st, stated that the Vietnamese People's Army captured the French stronghold of An Phu, 30 kilometers north of Hanoi, on December 29th, 1950, completely annihilating the French garrison of about 100 men and seizing all weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd, Vietnam News Agency, Haiphong: The victories of the Vietnamese People's Army on the northern border and the recent intensified attacks on the French defense lines in the Red River Delta have greatly panicked the French imperialists. The French colonial authorities have ordered the strengthening of Haiphong's defenses. The owners of several large stores and trading houses have been ordered to leave Haiphong so that their buildings can be requisitioned as defensive fortifications.

Despite the French colonial authorities' attempts to put up a desperate struggle, the morale of the French troops is rapidly declining. Large numbers of German mercenaries and Vietnamese puppet troops are refusing to go to the front lines to fight. Soldiers of the French colonial army openly condemn the incompetence of French officers and their false and deceptive propaganda. Notorious puppets in various places, fearing future punishment from the Vietnamese people, have resigned and fled to Hanoi.

The Vietnamese People's Army has launched a series of attacks on French strongholds in the central provinces of Vinh Yen, Phuc Yen, Bac Giang, and Bac Ninh, north of Hanoi. After suffering heavy losses on the northern border last October, the French army was forced to retreat from the southern part of Phu Tho province, northwest of Hanoi. The French army strengthened the defenses of Vinh Yen, Phuc Yen, Bac Giang, Bac Ninh, and other provincial strongholds, attempting to hold Hanoi and the rice-producing area of ​​the North Vietnamese highlands.

On the night of December 26th, the People's Army attacked the French stronghold in the Dai Phuc area, 30 kilometers north of Hanoi. The People's Army destroyed several enemy strongholds and seized all weapons and equipment. On the same night, another People's Army unit attacked French strongholds in Cao Phong, Phu Luan, and Hung Gia, destroying five French trucks between Phu Luan and Dai Son. By December 29th, the People's Army had annihilated two battalions of French troops in this area.

On December 29th, after an hour and a half of fighting, the People's Army annihilated the heavily fortified French stronghold of Thanh La, north of Hanoi, killing 80 French colonial troops, capturing the French lieutenant commander of the stronghold and the remaining French troops, and seizing all weapons and equipment. The People's Army also repelled and severely damaged two companies of French troops who came from Phuc Yen to reinforce.
