Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch:

Amidst the disastrous defeat of the invasion of Korea, Britain convenes the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. The conference reveals a further development of the contradictions between the U.S. and Britain, and the same divisions and contradictions exist among the Commonwealth countries.

The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference was held in London from January 4th to 12th. This conference was convened in a situation where the imperialist adventure of invading Korea suffered a decisive defeat, the colonial rule of imperialism in the East was in crisis, and the contradictions between the United States and Britain were consequently further sharpened. The conference was chaired by British Prime Minister Attlee, and the participants included the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon, Southern Rhodesia, and the representative of the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa.

The main characteristic of this conference is that the divisions and contradictions between the United States and Britain have further developed, and the same divisions and contradictions also exist within the members of the British Commonwealth. The original main topic of the meeting was to discuss the so-called "defense of Britain's lifeline through the Middle East to the Indian and Pacific Oceans." However, due to the serious crisis caused by the defeat of the aggressors in Korea throughout the imperialist camp, as the final communiqué of the meeting admitted, the meeting discussed the international situation centered on the Korean War and the policy toward China almost "every day." When discussing these issues, the conference increasingly criticized the United States' Far East policy. According to Reuters, which often reflects the official opinions of the British government, the "general opinion believes that although the Commonwealth should cooperate closely with the United States, it should not allow the United States' policies to implicate the Commonwealth countries too deeply, especially in the Far East." The conference communiqué stated that the conference "is committed to achieving a cessation of the Korean War so that all major powers concerned can sit down together and reconcile their fundamental differences." However, due to the British group's dependence on the United States, the conference communiqué also stated that the Commonwealth countries "cooperate closely with the United States" and "are willing at any time to promote the greatest internal consensus through negotiation procedures and reach a common international policy with the United States and other friendly and cooperative countries."

The conference followed the United States' policy on the Japan issue. The conference communiqué stated: "The Prime Ministers discussed the conditions for a peace treaty with Japan and the guarantees that may be included therein. They reaffirmed that they believe that the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan is a matter of urgency." United Press International quoted well-informed sources as admitting that the conference agreed that the thirteen countries of the Far Eastern Commission should convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, "even if the Soviet Union and China refuse to participate, it will still be held." The "majority of Commonwealth leaders" who participated in the meeting were also "prepared to agree to the United States' plan to rearm Japan." Like the United States, they attempted to use the resurgence of Japanese militarist forces to "stabilize the boiling Far East situation."

The final communiqué of the conference used "harmony and consensus" to describe the progress of the conference. However, the facts show that when the conference discussed the so-called "defense" issue from the Middle East to the Pacific, it exposed the deep contradictions within the Commonwealth. On this issue, Britain, on the grounds that it "already has heavy obligations in Europe under the North Atlantic Treaty," demanded that Pakistan be responsible for "protecting" the Middle East Muslim region, India bear the main task of "defending" Southeast Asia, and Australia and New Zealand take over Britain's tasks in Hong Kong and Malaya. However, when the conference discussed defense issues on the 6th and 8th, "the two major Asian partners that Britain wanted to continue to rely on—India and Pakistan," along with Ceylon, did not attend the meeting twice. Australia and New Zealand also emphasized: "Both countries have felt the pain of labor shortages." If they were to make up the number of British troops currently in Malaya and Hong Kong, "their human and material resources would encounter difficulties, especially because they have already sent some troops to Korea." Due to this, the final communiqué of the conference only vaguely stated that the conference believed that the "stability" of the Middle East region "is of deep concern to all Commonwealth countries."

The conference also discussed the "raw material shortage" problem caused by the U.S.-British imperialist arms race. Britain originally planned to establish an organization at the meeting to control the prices, procurement, and distribution of raw materials in India, Pakistan, and Ceylon. However, Britain's proposal was opposed by the aforementioned three countries. As a result, the conference only agreed to "exchange economic intelligence on raw materials within the Commonwealth" (Reuters).

It can be seen that although the British Commonwealth group issued another statement after the meeting stating that they decided to "strengthen defense with all speed and diligence" and superficially clamored that "close cooperation with the United States is their glory," the facts prove that the British group's defense is built on sand, and the so-called "close cooperation" between Britain and the United States has already failed to cover up the contradictions of interests between the ruling groups of the two countries.

### 在侵朝战争惨败后的形势下  英召开联邦总理会议  会议表现了美英矛盾进一步的发展  联邦各国间同样存在着分歧与矛盾

　　在侵朝战争惨败后的形势下
    英召开联邦总理会议
    会议表现了美英矛盾进一步的发展  联邦各国间同样存在着分歧与矛盾
    【新华社十九日讯】不列颠联邦总理会议自一月四日至十二日在伦敦举行。这次会议，是在帝国主义侵朝冒险遭到决定性失败，帝国主义在东方的殖民地统治发生危机以及美英之间的矛盾因而更加尖锐化的情势下召开的。会议由英首相艾德礼主持，参加者有加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰、印度、锡兰、南罗得西亚的总理和南非联邦总理的代表。
    这次会议的主要特点，是美英之间的分歧与矛盾，有了进一步的发展，而不列颠联邦成员国内部也存在着同样的分歧与矛盾。会议原定的主要议题，是讨论所谓《经由中东到印度洋和太平洋的英国生命线的防务问题》。但是，由于侵略者在朝鲜的败局在整个帝国主义阵营中所引起的严重危机，如会议最后公报所承认的，会议几乎“每天”都讨论以朝鲜战争、对华政策为中心的国际局势。而在讨论到这些问题时，会议对美国的远东政策有着愈来愈多的抨击。据经常反映英国官方意见的路透社称：会议中的“一般意见认为，联邦虽应与美国密切合作，但不应使美国的政策把联邦国家牵累太深，特别在远东”。会议的公报称：会议“致力于获致朝鲜战争的停止，以便各个有关大国能共坐一堂，调和其基本分歧”。然而，由于英国集团对美国的依赖，会议公报又声明：联邦国家“与美国密切合作”，并“愿在任何时候，以谈判程序促进内部的最大的一致，并且与美国，与以其他友好合作的国家获致一个共同的国际政策”。
    会议在日本问题上追随美国的政策。会议的公报说：“总理们讨论了对日媾和的条件和其中可能包括的保障。他们确申，他们认为早日缔结对日和约，是一件当急之务”。合众社引消息灵通人士的话承认，会议同意由远东委员会十三国尽早召开对日和会，“即使苏联和中国拒绝参加，还是照样举行”。参加会议的“大多数联邦领袖”，还“准备同意美国的重新武装日本的计划”。他们和美国一样，企图利用日本军国主义势力的再起，来“稳定沸腾的远东局势”。
    会议最后发表的公报以“和谐一致”来描述这次会议的进行。然而事实说明，会议在讨论到所谓从中东到太平洋的“防务”问题时，就暴露了联邦内部存在着深刻的矛盾。在这个问题上，英国以它“在北大西洋公约下已在欧洲负有沉重的义务”为借口，要求巴基斯坦负责“保护”中东回教地区，印度负担“防御”东南亚的主要任务，澳大利亚、新西兰接替英国在香港和马来亚的任务。但是，当会议于六日、八日讨论防务问题时，“英国想继续依靠的两个亚洲大伙伴——印度与巴基斯坦”，连同锡兰在内，两次均没有参加会议。澳大利亚、新西兰亦强调：“两国均已感到人力缺乏之苦”，如果要凑足英国刻在马来亚与香港的兵力数字，“它们的人力物力都会遭到困难，特别是因为它们已经派了一些军队到朝鲜”。由于这样，会议最后公报中只含糊地说：会议认为中东地区的“稳定”，“对所有联邦国家都是有深切的关系”。
    会议还讨论了由于美英帝国主义备战结果而引起的“原料短缺”问题。英国原图在会上成立一个机构，统制印、巴、锡三国原料的价格、采购与分配。但英国的建议，遭到了上述三国的反对。结果，会议只是协议《交换联邦范围内关于原料方面的经济情报》（路透社）。
    人们可以看出：尽管英国联邦集团在会后发表的另一声明中，表示它们决定“以全部速率和辛勤来加强防务”，并在表面上扬言“与美国密切合作乃是它们的光荣”，但是，事实证明，英国集团的防务是建筑在沙滩上的，而英国所谓与美国的“密切合作”，也已经掩盖不住两国统治集团利害的矛盾了。
