Concerning the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean and Important Asian Issues
Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, China Democratic League, China Association for Promoting Democracy Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Telegram to the UN

[By Our Correspondent] Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued a written statement. The China Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy issued statements respectively, warmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram to the First Committee of the United Nations.

The written statement issued by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, stated: The so-called principles and opinions on resolving the Korean issue and other Far East issues recently proposed by the First Committee of the United Nations under the manipulation of American imperialism are entirely a deceptive policy put forward as a result of the disastrous defeat of American imperialism in its aggression against Korea, in an attempt to give the invading American forces a chance to catch their breath. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram to the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 17th of this month not only exposed the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism to "cease fire first and then negotiate," but also put forward four suggestions to the United Nations for holding peace talks as soon as possible. This fully demonstrates the determination of the Chinese people and the Chinese people's government to sincerely and earnestly hope for genuine world peace and human security. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang fully agree with and warmly support the four suggestions made by Foreign Minister Zhou.

The statement from the headquarters of the China Democratic League stated: The China Democratic League firmly supports the position and proposals in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram of January 17 to the First Committee of the United Nations. Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal that "negotiations between the countries concerned should be held on the basis of agreeing to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and letting the Korean people resolve Korean internal affairs themselves, so as to quickly resolve the Korean War" is absolutely correct. If American imperialism refuses this proposal, the true face of American imperialism's aggression to the end will be fully exposed. Secondly, Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal that "the content of the negotiations must include the withdrawal of American armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait and related issues in the Far East" is also legitimate and reasonable. American imperialism's aggression against Korea and Taiwan is an inseparable conspiracy, which is a universally known fact. Therefore, American imperialism must withdraw its invading troops from Korea and at the same time withdraw its Seventh Fleet from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, so that the Korean issue can be completely resolved. As for Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal that "the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations should be confirmed from the beginning of the seven-nation conference," this is an even more reasonable proposition. Today, every politician in the world who has a slight understanding of international reality knows that excluding the People's Republic of China, with its 475 million people, from the United Nations will inevitably prevent the genuine resolution of the Far East and world issues.

The written statement issued by the China Association for Promoting Democracy believes that: The content of the four proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou are the foundation for truly peacefully resolving the Korean issue, leading to peace in the Far East, and the preconditions for conducting negotiations, and fully conform to the will of the people of our country and peace-loving people all over the world.

In their statements, the democratic parties unanimously stated: If American imperialism still does not know repentance, the people of our country must more firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's four proposals with various practical actions, continue to support the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, give the American aggressors greater blows, and fight to the end to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

　　关于和平解决朝鲜及亚洲重要问题
    民革民盟民进拥护周外长复联合国电
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深发表书面谈话，中国民主同盟和中国民主促进会分别发表声明，热烈拥护我外交部周恩来部长复联合国第一委员会电。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深发表的书面谈话称：最近联合国第一委员会在美帝操纵下，向我国提出的所谓解决朝鲜问题及其他远东问题的各项原则意见，完全是由于美帝侵朝惨败而提出的一种欺骗政策，想借此使侵朝美军得到一个喘息的机会，绝无诚意真正及早结束朝鲜战争。我外交部周恩来部长本月十七日致联合国大会第一委员会复电，除揭露美帝国主义的“先停战后谈判”的侵略阴谋外；并向联合国提出四项建议以便及早举行和平谈判。这充分表示了中国人民和中国人民的政府诚心诚意地期望世界真正和平与人类安全的决心。民革同志对于周外长所提的四项建议，完全同意，并热烈拥护。
    中国民主同盟总部的声明称：中国民主同盟坚决拥护周恩来外长一月十七日致联合国第一委员会复电中的立场与提议。周外长提议“在同意从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决的基础上举行有关各国的谈判，迅速解决朝鲜战争”，这种主张是绝对正确的。如果美帝对这一提议加以拒绝，美帝侵略到底的真面目就完全暴露了。其次，周外长提议“谈判内容，必须包括美国武装力量从台湾及台湾海峡撤退和远东有关问题”，这种主张，也是正当合理的。美帝侵朝侵台是分离不开的阴谋，这是举世皆知的事实。所以美帝在朝鲜撤退侵略军，必须同时在台湾及台湾海峡撤退其第七舰队，这才算朝鲜问题的彻底解决。至于周外长提议“中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位即从举行七国会议起予以确定”，这更是合情合理的主张。今天世界上稍为认识国际现实的政治家都知道排除四亿七千五万人民的中华人民共和国于联合国之外，必不能真正解决远东及世界问题。
    中国民主促进会发表的书面声明认为：周外长提出的四项提议的内容，是真正和平解决朝鲜问题，导致远东和平的基础和进行谈判的先决条件，是完全符合我国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的意志的。
    各民主党派在声明中一致表示：如果美帝国主义仍然不知悔悟，我们全国人民要更坚决地以各种实际行动来拥护周外长的四项提议，再接再厉地支援朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军的英勇战斗，给予美国侵略者以更大的打击，为保卫远东和世界和平而奋斗到底。
