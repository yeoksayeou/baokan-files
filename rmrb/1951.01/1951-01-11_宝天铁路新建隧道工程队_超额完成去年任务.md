　　Baoji-Tianshui Railway New Tunnel Engineering Team
    Exceeds Last Year's Task
    [Our Newspaper] The new tunnel construction project on the Baoji-Tianshui Railway line, totaling 677 meters in length, has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the 1950 task due to the selfless and enthusiastic labor of the engineering team's workers. In particular, a 252-meter-long tunnel located 87 kilometers west of Baoji, known as the "blind gut" of the Baoji-Tianshui line, was the most dangerous section of the Baoji-Tianshui railway. As a result, the construction project was exceptionally difficult. The Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to build it four times since 1941, without success, and trains frequently derailed there. The Second Team of the China Construction Engineering Corporation Mechanical Road Construction Engineering, which was responsible for constructing this section, showed unprecedented labor enthusiasm. Construction began on September 20th, and by December 28th, the tunnel was completely opened, and a solid 52-meter pilot tunnel project was built on the west entrance, completing 200% of the original plan of 26 meters. The rock expansion project on the east entrance had also been completed to 108 meters by the 26th, exceeding the original plan of 90 meters by 120%. This preliminary work performed what could be described as surgery on the "blind gut" of the Baoji-Tianshui line. For example, the Northwest District Mechanical Road Construction Third Team began work on September 16th. By November 18th, under the difficult conditions of semi-manual and semi-mechanical labor, they had cleared 2,000 cubic meters of earth and rock from the east entrance roadbed, and the pilot tunnel had advanced 48.6 meters, completing the 1950 task ahead of schedule. By December 14th, the pilot tunnel had advanced 105 meters, completing 220% of the task. Furthermore, machine workers Jia Wenqing and three others from the First Engineering Section completed 200 electric carbide lamps, originally planned for 40 days, in just 30 days, and also saved some materials.
    As the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the nation expanded to the entire railway system, the workers engaged in the construction of this massive project further utilized their wisdom and fully demonstrated their creativity. The more than 700 employees of the Second Engineering Team overfulfilled their production tasks during the seven days of the "Resist America, Aid Korea Week" which they automatically organized. For example, when calculating the number of arch bricks transported by manpower, the maximum was only 2,000 bricks, but they transported 3,500 bricks. Young worker Zhang Daoming's previous record for carrying bricks before the shock week was 25 bricks, but during the shock week, he created a new record of carrying 50 bricks in one day. The First Engineering Team divided the work time into day and night shifts, with the two shifts of workers taking turns to rush the work day and night. Huang Hanrui, the chief engineer of the tunnel engineering team, did not sleep or rest for five days and five nights. All the employees responsible for transporting materials on the Baoji-Tianshui line put forward the slogan of a transportation competition, increasing the speed from 80 kilometers per day to 120 kilometers. At the same time, engineers and workers also ensured and achieved no responsibility accidents. For example, when the Second Engineering Team was opening the most difficult 52-meter tunnel section of the "blind gut" (this section was composed of loose stone, sulfur sand, and soil-filled stones, which were prone to collapse), due to the courage and carefulness of the engineers and workers, although they encountered three collapses, they still safely survived the danger without any accidents.

　　宝天铁路新建隧道工程队
    超额完成去年任务
    【本报讯】宝天铁路线上全长六百七十七公尺的各段新建隧道工程，由于工程队职工们忘我地热情劳动，已纷纷提前并超额完成了一九五○年的任务。特别是在宝鸡以西八十七公里处，有着宝天线上“盲肠”称号的一个长达二五二公尺的隧道，是宝天铁路行程上最危险的一段，因此建筑工程也是异常艰巨，国民党反动派曾于一九四一年起连续修建四次未成功，火车经常在此出轨。这次负担兴修这段工程的中国建筑企业公司机械筑路工程二队却以空前的劳动热情，从九月二十日动工，至十二月二十八日已完全打通，并坚固地筑成了西口五十二公尺的导坑工程，完成了原来计划二十六公尺的百分之二百；东口的坚石扩大工程到二十六日止也已完成了一○八公尺，超额完成了原定九十公尺的百分之一百二十。初步地给宝天线上的“盲肠”开了一刀。又如西北区机械筑路第三队于九月十六日动工后，至十一月十八日止，在半人工半机械的重重困难条件下，已经清除了东洞口路堑两千土石方，导坑打进去四十八点六公尺，提前完成了一九五○年的任务；到十二月十四日已导坑进去一百零五公尺，完成了百分之二百二十的任务。再如第一工程段机匠贾文清等四人用三十天的时间完成了原计划四十天的二百座电石灯，还节省了一部分材料。
    当抗美援朝保家卫国运动扩展到全国铁路时，正在修建这一巨大工程的工人们更加运用智慧，充分发挥了创造性。第二工程队七百多职工在自动组织“抗美援朝周”的七天里，超额完成了生产任务。其中如运输拱砖按人力计算，最高只能运输二千块，结果却运输了三千五百块；青年工人张道明在突击周前背砖纪录是二十五块，在突击周里即创造了一天背五十块的新纪录。第一工程队把工作时间分成日夜两班，两班工人轮流，日以继夜地赶工。隧道工程组的主管工程师黄汉瑞曾五天五夜不肯合眼休息。负责宝天线运输材料的全体职工提出了运输竞赛的口号，从每天八十公里的速度提高到了一百二十公里。同时，工程师与工人们也保证并做到了不出责任事故。例如，第二工程队在打通“盲肠”全段最艰巨的西口五十二公尺的隧道时（这一段是松石、硫沙和土夹石等组成的，易于塌陷），由于工程师和工人们的勇敢和细心，虽曾遇到三次塌陷，但仍安全度过危险，没有发生事故。
