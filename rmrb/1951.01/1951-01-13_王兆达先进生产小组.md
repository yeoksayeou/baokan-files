　　Wang Zhaoda Advanced Production Team
　　Lüda General Trade Union
　　The Wang Zhaoda lathe operator team of the Guanghe Factory in the Lüda area has consistently completed its tasks ahead of schedule over the past year, while ensuring quality (quality tolerance not exceeding two tolerances). Wang Zhaoda is a model worker in industry who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. His production team completely eliminated rejects in the second half of 1950, after producing a total of 47 defective products of various sizes (total wasted man-hours of 13.22) in the first half of the year. As a result, the team has made great achievements in production over the past year.

　　I. Methods adopted by the Wang Zhaoda team to achieve such results:
　　First, meticulous work plans and rational task allocation. When the team leader receives a task, he first carefully considers who is suitable based on the product's specifications and requirements. Then, he convenes a meeting and rationally assigns tasks according to the machine's efficiency and the workers' technical strengths, ensuring completion. If there are tasks that are difficult to allocate, the team leader adopts a centralized leadership approach with tiered allocation (i.e., tasks with more levels are expedited upward, and tasks with fewer levels are expedited downward). Two or three days before a task is about to be completed, he proactively contacts the workshop director to request new tasks and urge material delivery, thereby preventing production interruptions.
　　Second, established various responsibility systems and technical management methods:
　　(1) System of checking the first piece and conducting intermediate spot checks. The focus of inspection is on the important parts of the product specifications and requirements, and on co-workers whose technical skills are prone to producing defective products.
　　(2) System of explaining the task. When explaining the task, the requirements of the drawings are presented, and the important key points to be noted during operation are pointed out. Suitable cutting tools and required fixtures are also suggested. If the team leader fails to explain clearly and errors occur, the team leader is responsible.
　　(3) System for using and protecting machines and tools. For example, specific personnel are responsible for opening and closing the power switch and motor, and the lifting rods are inspected and oiled on time. Designated personnel strictly implement the inspection system for machines and tools.
　　(4) Using regular and irregular meeting systems to study technology and review work. When difficult problems are discovered, the team utilizes spare time to convene meetings to find the causes and research solutions. A regular meeting is held every Monday (combined with the trade union group meeting) to study operational knowledge and research technology, thereby improving the technical level of all co-workers in the team. At this meeting, criticism and self-criticism are also carried out to review the team's production work.
　　Third, using technical skills to help others and demonstrate by example. If the first finished product of a co-worker does not meet the specifications, the team leader Wang Zhaoda personally makes a sample for the co-worker to watch and then asks him to do the same. He uses the time spent on large tasks to help co-workers with lower technical skills, guiding them in making fixtures or using fixtures, and aligning workpieces. Guiding co-workers in grinding suitable cutting tools and checking whether the co-worker's cutting speed is appropriate.
　　Fourth, preparing today for tomorrow's work. The team's slogan is: "Prepare today so you can start early tomorrow." Therefore, every day before washing hands at the end of work, they wipe the machines, install the belts, and tidy up tools, drawings, materials, finished products, and semi-finished products. This ensures punctual work the next day.
　　Fifth, using activists to promote work. In addition to setting an example and using technical skills to help others, Wang Zhaoda is also good at using activists to motivate others. For example, when encountering a co-worker who clearly knows that the quota is reasonable but still wants to bargain, Wang Zhaoda does not use a commanding approach to force him to do it. Instead, he assigns a co-worker with lower technical skills than him (the bargainer) to work with him, using a comparative trial method to motivate him and using practical examples to educate him.
　　Sixth, learning from technical personnel. The team often studies and improves technology, improves tools, proposes rationalization suggestions, and uses the method of working together on large tasks (commonly known as "nested work"). It is precisely because the team constantly studies and improves technology that when encountering technical problems that cannot be solved within the team, they proactively consult technicians and respect the guidance of technicians. Therefore, the relationship between workers and technical personnel is also very good.
　　In addition, they also frequently understand the workers' production mood and care about their lives, and mobilize everyone to bring good apprentices, so that new and old co-workers are united.

　　II. Shortcomings that still exist in the Wang Zhaoda team:
　　(1) The division of responsibilities between the administrative and trade union in the team is not clear enough. It is correct that the administrative team leader is fully responsible for proposing tasks, preparing raw materials, implementing various systems and technical management, and providing technical assistance and guidance. In addition, the trade union group leader must be responsible for presiding over mass work activities such as formulating the team's scheduled plans (or individual plans), organizing mutual competitions, commenting on the disputes over quota levels, understanding the workers' ideological situation and life difficulties, carrying out propaganda and mobilization work, creating production charts, conducting family work, and holding team life meetings. The administrative team leader should actively participate in these activities as a member.
　　(2) The team's propaganda and mobilization work is relatively poor, especially the commendation of activists within the team and those who have transformed from backward to advanced is insufficient.

　　III. The team's future direction of effort:
　　(1) On the basis of ensuring superior quality and completing tasks on time or ahead of schedule, specific plans and implementation methods for the team to gradually reduce costs should be formulated: such as extending the machine maintenance period, saving machine oil, the amount of wiping cloths, and reducing tool consumption to promote the realization of workshop cost management, in order to achieve the goal of improving operation and management.
　　(2) In technical operation, it is still necessary to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve technology, improve tools, maximize the efficiency of machines, and study new operating methods. (Originally published in Lüda People's Daily)

　　王兆达先进生产小组
    旅大总工会
    旅大地区广和工厂王兆达车工小组，一年来一贯地提前完成任务，而且保证了质量（质量公差数不超过两道）。王兆达是出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的工业劳动模范。他领导的这个生产小组，在一九五○年上半年共出大小四七件废品（总浪费工时一三·二二点），下半年完全消灭了废品。因此，一年来该组在生产上创造了很大的成绩。
    一、王兆达小组创造出这样成绩所采用的方法
    第一、工作计划周密，合理分配任务。组长接到任务时，首先仔细考虑，根据产品的规格要求，谁做合适；然后再召集会议，按照机器效能和工人的技术特长，合理地分配下去。并计算出每件活、每个人的具体完成时间，要保证完成。如遇不好分配的活，组长便采取集中领导，按级分配的办法（即级多的活，往上赶，级少的活往下赶）。活将完的前两三天就主动地去联系车间主任要活催料，因而防止了生产间断。
    第二、建立了各种责任制，和技术管理的办法：
    （一）检查第一个活和中间抽查的制度。检查的重点放在产品规格要求的重要部分和技术差容易出废品的工友。
    （二）交代活的制度。交代活时，根据图纸的要求和指出操作当中应注意的重要关键。并提出适用的车刀，和需要的胎具等。如果组长交代不清而出了差错，由组长负责。
    （三）机器工具使用保护制度。如开闭电门和电动机有专人负责，并按时检查吊杠和浇油，以及指定专人严格执行机器工具的检查制度等。
    （四）运用定期与不定期的会议制度，研究技术和检讨工作。发现了困难问题，便随时利用业余时间，召集全组会议来找出原因，研究出克服的办法。每星期一开一次定期会议（结合工会小组会），学习操作知识，研究技术，借此来提高全组工友的技术水平。在这会议上，并开展批评与自我批评来检讨全组的生产工作。
    第三、以技术去帮助别人，和先做样子示范。检查工友第一个成品如不符合规格时，组长王兆达就亲自做个样子给工友看，再叫他照样做。利用做大活走刀的时间去帮助技术低的工友，指导作胎具或胎具的使用法，以及把活找正等。指导工友，磨出适用的车刀，和检查工友车开的速度是否合适。
    第四、今天准备好明天的工作。该组的口号是：“今天准备好，明天动手早。”因此每天晚上下班的时候在洗手以前便擦好机器，打下皮带，把工具、图纸、材料、成品及半成品收拾得很妥当。因此，保证了第二天准时工作。
    第五、运用积极分子推动工作。王兆达除以身作则以技术帮助别人外，而且善于运用积极分子去推动别人。如遇到对定额明知合理，还想讨价还价的工友，王兆达并不是用命令主义的办法硬要他干，而是指派比他（讨价者）技术低的工友去与他合干，用比较试做的方法带动他，用实际的例子去教育他。
    第六、向技术人员学习。该组经常研究改进技术，改良工具，和提出合理化建议，以及大批活运用伙干的办法（俗称“套着干”）。正由于该组不断地研究技术和提高技术，因此遇到在本组解决不了的技术问题，就主动地去请教技师，并尊重技师的指导。所以工人和技术人员间的关系也很好。
    另外，还经常了解工人的生产情绪和关心工人的生活，发动大家带好徒弟，使新老工友团结。
    二、王兆达小组尚存在着的缺点
    （一）该组在行政工会的职责分工上不够明确。提出任务，准备原材料、执行各种制度和技术管理，以及在技术上的帮助指导，这些行政组长完全负责是对的。另外对制订小组的预约计划（或个人的），组织互相之间的竞赛，评议定额高低的争论，了解工人思想情况和生活上的困难，进行宣传鼓动工作，制出生产图表，进行家属工作和小组生活会议等群众工作活动，须由工会组长负责主持。行政组长要以会员的资格积极地参加这些活动。
    （二）该组在宣传鼓动工作上较差，尤其是对小组内的积极分子和由落后转变为先进的分子表扬不够。
    三、该组今后努力的方向
    （一）在保证优越质量，按时或提前完成任务的基础上，要逐渐地订出小组降低成本的具体计划及实施办法：如延长机器检修的期限、节省机器油、擦布的数量、降低工具消耗量等来推动车间成本管理的实现，以达到改进经营管理的目的。
    （二）在技术操作上，还须学习苏联的先进经验，提高技术、改进工具、发挥机器的效能、研究新的操作方法等。（原载旅大人民日报）
