Xinhua News Agency, January 25th:

Despite the fact that the reactionary Yoshida government and the heads of reactionary parties such as the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party are willingly acting as running dogs for the United States, actively advocating a separate peace treaty, some more clear-headed elements within the Japanese bourgeoisie have already realized that a separate peace treaty will bring crisis and disaster to Japan. The newspaper *Asahi Shimbun*, which sells approximately 3.4 million copies, published an article on the 14th stating that a separate peace treaty would make Japan's situation "more difficult and embarrassing," and that it would bring Japan "only a temporary peace." Even if it could bring Japan "certain temporary political and economic benefits," it "will bring Japan many 'difficulties,' which may lead to a serious crisis, causing a Japan whose wounds have not fully healed to suffer misfortune again."

In view of the Japanese people's widespread opposition to a separate peace treaty, the conservative Socialist Party also reiterated its advocacy of an overall peace treaty at its national congress on the 21st. Suzuki Mosaburo, the newly appointed chairman of the party's Central Executive Committee, wrote on the 23rd that a separate peace treaty "may involve Japan in armed conflict."

　　日本一部分资产阶级对单独媾和颇有顾虑
    【新华社二十五日讯】尽管吉田反动政府及自由党、民主党等反动政党的头子们甘充美国的走卒，积极鼓吹单独媾和，但日本资产阶级内部某些头脑比较清醒的分子已经觉察到：单独媾和将给日本带来危机和灾难。销数约三百四十万份的报纸《朝日新闻》，在十四日撰文称：单独和约将使日本的处境“更为困难和难堪”，它给日本带来的“必将是一个暂短的和平”。即使它可使日本得到“某些暂时的政治和经济利益”，但是，它“将带给日本很多的‘困难’，这些困难可能促成严重危机，而使一个创伤还没有完全恢复的日本，再遭恶运”。
    鉴于日本人民普遍反对单独和约，保守的社会党在二十一日的全国代表大会上，也重申了全面媾和的主张。新任的该党中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎在二十三日撰文称：单独和约“可能使日本卷入武装冲突”。
