　　Building Thousands of Roads to Victory
　  ——Third Installment of Glimpses of Northern Vietnam
    By Our Special Correspondent　Meng Qing

    Having completed the procedures for going to the front, I left Thai Nguyen province and headed towards Cao Bang via Bac Kan, eager to witness the Cao Bang-Lang Son campaign, which had been in preparation for several months and was of decisive importance for the entire situation in northern Vietnam. As I traveled north, the closer I got to the front, the better the roads became, the more people I saw, and the more excited I felt each day.

    Along the way, many of the highways had been renovated. From the different colors of the old and new soil, one could clearly see the traces of destruction, the "zigzags" and "plow teeth marks" that had once cut the roads into pieces. In many places, the new road surfaces were already covered with the tire tracks of trucks, oxcarts, and bicycles. Every day, well-equipped Vietnamese People's Army soldiers and hundreds of thousands of laborers, gathered from all over, carrying rice, chickens, ducks, and ammunition boxes, passed over them.

    From the clothing and accents of the laborers, one could recognize that most of them were ethnic minority people from the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam, including the Nung and Man ethnic groups, as well as many Kinh people brought from the midlands and the Red River Delta plains. As they walked, they talked and proudly counted the names of the places recently liberated. Each person narrated the heroic battle stories they knew about the troops, boasting about the mountains of newly captured American weapons, and entire warehouses of ammunition and uniforms. From their conversations, I learned that most of the Vietnamese main forces had recently replaced their weapons with new ones seized from the enemy, and had transferred their original old guns to the guerrillas and militia. On the other hand, many provincial and county local forces were also concentrating in large numbers in order to expand their main force and prepare for a large-scale counter-offensive.

    A female laborer, pointing to the tire tracks on the road, excitedly told her companions: "Look, how many trucks loaded with grain and ammunition have been driving to the vicinity of Cao Bang and Dong Khe every night recently! These roads will probably have to carry tanks in the future!"

    "When will it be our turn to build roads in our area?" This sentence represented the inner expectations of all the laborers who came from the plains of the Third Interzone to serve in the war effort.

    They mentioned many roads in the south, central, and northern regions. Recalling the early days of the resistance war, in order to block the temporarily superior, modernly equipped enemy, the Vietnamese People's Army fought the French troops in the front, while groups of young men and women in the rear used their hands and all kinds of primitive tools to tear up the roads. In many places, the roads that the enemy had just repaired during the day were destroyed again at night. The French had used all kinds of terrifying means to deal with the Vietnamese people. In the areas of Binh Tri Thien and Hong Quang, they had gathered the people together and made them walk along the roads. At each destroyed section, they would cut off the head of a young person as revenge. However, no matter how cruel the invaders' methods were, they could not stop the destructive activities of the masses.

    After four years of arduous struggle, the Vietnamese armed forces had gradually grown. They not only had rich combat experience, but also possessed various modern equipment obtained from the enemy. Today, on the eve of the national mobilization to prepare for the counter-offensive, the scene on the roads once again resembled that of the early days of the resistance war. Here and there, everywhere, were ordinary people carrying hoes and shovels, but the mood of the people was completely different. On that long, undulating northern Vietnamese highway, groups of laborers gathered under the shade of trees near mountain springs, washing their hands and feet, boiling water and cooking rice. Everywhere, smoke billowed, and the sounds of talking, laughter, and echoes from the valleys turned the wilderness into a lively place.

    Regardless of sunny or rainy days, the work was always proceeding intensely. One day, continuous autumn rain obscured the earth, and the mountains and fields were a misty expanse. I saw the laborers still working on the hillside. Large slabs of stone were slowly carried to the foot of the mountain by two people. Several laborers stood on high ground, throwing the stones down one by one, and the people below easily caught them. The rustling of the rain, combined with the rhythmic movements of the people, formed a very moving labor scene.

    Day and night, the masses dug soil from the mountainside and filled in the roads, also laying a layer of blue gravel that reflected a glittering light under the strong sun. The mountains that ran parallel to the road, from the waist to the foot of the mountain, revealed a patch of red, looking from afar like an endless red wall protecting the road.

    The highway crossed countless rivers and streams, large and small. It is said that half a year ago, all the bridges on these rivers and streams were upside down in the riverbeds, replaced by a single-log bridge or a few rickety bamboo poles. This scene had driven the French crazy. Now, most of the bridges have been erected, and some have been newly built. For camouflage, the laborers planted branches on both sides of each bridge. At the same time, timber and bamboo were piled up on the riverbanks, ready for immediate repairs after enemy bombing.

    A young Vietnamese man was responsible for managing the bridges on this important section of the highway. In the past, he was a small clerk in the French highway bureau. At that time, he was eager to learn some bridge and road building skills, but the French refused to teach him anything. But today, working with Vietnamese technicians, they are able to build sturdy bridges that can safely carry several tons of vehicles. Every day, this proactive and responsible young man is constantly planning, using many bamboos to tie together pontoon bridges, putting them into the river to test their buoyancy, and preparing to replace the wooden bridges that may be destroyed at any time.

    Some of the people building the bridges are old bridge workers from this area, who once built those bridges with their own hands and then destroyed them with their own hands. For three or four years, the French had tried to lure them out with high wages but failed. They gave up their skills and went home to farm. Now, for the cause of national liberation, to help their own troops counter-attack, under the call of President Ho Chi Minh, these old men are once again bending over and hammering nails on the bridges.

    Currently in northern Vietnam, the colonialists have shifted from protecting highways and bridges to destroying them everywhere. Every late at night, in isolated strongholds, the desolate and frightened French officers lie in bed, and as soon as they close their eyes, they seem to feel as if countless trucks and one oxcart after another, fully loaded with weapons and ammunition, are rolling over their chests, transporting supplies to the surrounding Vietnamese People's Army—a force that is growing stronger and better equipped every day. So, early the next morning, they hurriedly get up, send out planes, and search everywhere for bombing targets, but they can't find anything. Sometimes they accidentally find a few pedestrians or a few horses by the road, and the planes frantically dive and strafe the surrounding woods, and drop large amounts of American incendiary bombs. A bridge that the French once sent a whole company of troops to guard day and night is now being bombarded with tons of bombs. Even the wooden bridges leading to Cao Bang have been destroyed, so that the French troops trapped in Cao Bang are like criminals sentenced to death, waiting for the day of execution.

    These destructive acts mark the impending tragic end of the French colonialists.

    According to Vietnamese comrades, from now on, all roads and bridges must continue to be built. Everywhere along the roads that have already been repaired, piles of gravel are accumulating, and they are constantly increasing. From northern Vietnam - the heart of the resistance - thousands of roads will be built, extending to all parts of the country, and towards the future of victory, first pointing to the Third Interzone including the Red River Delta. There are thousands of acres of fertile land there, which can be harvested three times a year; there are dense sugarcane, corn, and banana gardens; there are more than five million suffering compatriots; there are Hanoi, Haiphong, and many magnificent cities. The people of the Red River Delta and all parts of the country are shedding blood and sweat every day and persevering in the struggle, and they are all eagerly watching northern Vietnam.

　　修筑起千百条通向胜利的道路
　  ——越北见闻之三
    本报特约记者　孟青
    办妥了到前方去的手续，我离开太原省，经过北?，向高平方向前进，要看这一场准备了好几个月的，对于整个越北局势具有决定作用的高平、谅山战役。北行，越接近前线，路越好，人越多，心情也一天比一天兴奋。
    沿途，公路多被重新翻修了。从旧土和新土的不同颜色，还可以清楚地看出许多“之字形”，“犁齿形”的，曾使公路寸断的破坏痕迹。许多处，新的路面已经布满了大卡车、牛车和脚踏车的轮胎印。每天，装备齐全的越南人民军，和成千成万的，从各地汇集起来的民工，挑着大米、鸡、鸭和弹药箱，从这上面走过。
    从民工的服装和口音，可以辨认出他们大多数是越北山区的土族人民，也还有侬、蛮等少数民族和许多从中游与红河三角洲平原地带来的京族民工。他们边走边谈，得意地数着最近解放的一些地名，各人叙述自己所知道的部队的英勇战斗故事，夸耀着那些堆积如山的新缴获的美式枪炮，和整仓整库的弹药、军装。从他们的谈话中，我知道多数越南主力军最近都换了由敌人方面夺来的新武器，把自己原来的旧枪枝，转给了游击队和民兵。另一方面，许多省和县的地方部队，也正在大量集中，以便扩弃主力，准备大规模的反攻。
    一个女民工，指着道路上的轮胎印，兴奋地对同行的伙伴们说：“看呀，最近每天晚上有多少满载着粮弹的汽车，开到高平和东溪附近去。这些路，将来恐怕还要走坦克呢！”
    “什么时候才轮到我们的地方修路？”这句话代表着所有从第三联区平原地带上来服战勤的民工们内心的期望。
    他们提到南部、中部和北部的许多公路。追述着抗战初期，为了阻挡那些暂时优势的，现代化装备的敌人，越南人民军在前面抗击着法军，后方的男女青年，一群群地用他们的双手和各式各样的原始工具，把公路掘得稀烂。许多地方，敌人白天刚修好的路，晚上又被破坏了。法国人曾用尽一切恐怖手段对付越南人民，在平、治、天和宏广一带，他们曾把民众集中起来，沿着公路走，每到一处被破坏的地方，就砍下一个青年人的头，作为报复。然而，不管侵略者的手段怎样残酷，都没法制止群众的破坏活动。
    经过四年的艰苦斗争，越南武装力量已经逐渐成长。他们不仅有了丰富的战斗经验，而且也拥有从敌人那里获得的各种现代化装备。今天，当着全国总动员准备反攻的前夜，公路上又出现宛如抗战初期的景象，这里那里，到处是扛着锄头和铲子的老百姓，但人们的心情却完全不同了。在那漫长的、山峦起伏的越北公路上，民工们成群结队，聚集在山泉附近的树荫底下，洗手洗脚，烧水煮饭，到处炊烟迷漫，谈话声，笑声和山谷间发出的回音，使旷野变成了热闹的场所。
    不管晴天雨天，工作始终在紧张地进行着。有一天，连绵的秋雨掩蔽了大地，山岭和田野一片朦胧。我看见民工们仍然在山坡上工作。大块的石板，由两个人扛着，慢慢搬到山脚。几个民工站在高处，把石头一块一块往下面抛，底下的人顺势轻松地接着。沙沙的雨声，配合着人们的有规律的动作，构成一幅很动人的劳动画面。
    群众夜以继日地从山边挖下泥土，填平了道路，还铺上一层青色石子，在强烈的太阳底下，反射出闪闪的光辉。和公路平行纵走着的山脉，从山腰到山脚，露出一片红色，远远地望去，好像一堵连绵无尽的护路红墙。
    公路穿越过无数大小河川。据说，半年以前，这些河川上所有的桥梁都倒插在河床里，代替它们的是一个独木桥或几根摇摇欲坠的竹子。这种景象曾使法国人气得发疯。现在，大部分桥梁都已架设起来，有的另外修筑了。为了伪装，民工在每一座桥的两旁插着树枝，同时，河岸上堆着木料和竹子，准备敌机轰炸后立即抢修。
    一个越南青年，负责管理这一段重要公路上的桥梁。他过去，是法国公路局的小职员，那时，他很想学一些修桥筑路的本领，法国人却什么都不肯教给他。而今天，和越南的技工们在一起，他们已能够造出载重几吨的汽车可以安稳地通过的坚固的桥梁。每天，这个积极负责的青年人，不断地在筹划着，用许多竹子扎成浮桥，放到河里去测验浮力，准备代替随时可能被炸毁的木桥。
    修桥的人们，有的是这一带的老桥工，曾经亲手建造那些桥梁，又亲手破坏了它。三、四年来，法国人曾用很高的工价也没有把他们招引出来。他们放弃了手艺，回家去种地了。现在，为了民族的解放事业，为了帮助自己的部队反攻，在胡志明主席的号召下，这些老人又都弯着腰，在桥上敲打着铁钉。
    目前在越北，殖民主义者已经从保护公路桥梁转为到处破坏。每天深夜，在孤立的据点里，凄凉惶恐的法国军官，躺在床上，一闭起眼睛，就好像感觉到如有无数大卡车和一辆接着一辆的牛车，满载着武装弹药，从他们的胸前辗过，输送给周围的越南人民军——这个队伍一天比一天壮大，装备一天比一天精良。于是，第二天一清早，他们就匆忙地爬起来，派出飞机，到处找寻轰炸的目标，然而他们什么都找不到。有时偶然发现路旁有几个行人或几匹马，飞机就疯狂地向那一带的树林俯冲扫射，并且投下大量的美国燃烧弹。过去法国人曾经派出整连军队日夜防护着的一座桥，现在，他们向那里投掷了上吨的炸弹。连通往高平的那些木桥，他们也破坏了，这样，困守在高平的法军，就像宣判了死刑的凶犯，等待着执行的日子。
    这些破坏行为，标志着行将到临的、法国殖民者的悲剧下场。
    据越南的同志谈，从现在起，所有的道路和桥梁都要继续修建。已经修好的公路两旁，到处堆积着碎石，并且还不断地增加。从越北——抗战的心脏，还要修起千百条路，向全国各地，向胜利前途伸展，而首先是指向那包括红河三角洲的第三联区。那里有万顷良田，每年可以收割三次；有茂密的甘蔗、玉蜀黍和香蕉园；有五百多万受尽苦难的同胞；有河内、海防和许多壮丽的城市。红河三角洲和全国各地的人民，每天正流血流汗坚持着斗争，他们也都在眼巴巴地注视着越北。
