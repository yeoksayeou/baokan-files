　　The Brilliant Achievements of the Railway Engineering Corps in 1950
　　Song Shudong
　　In 1950, China's railway construction shifted from temporary repairs to meet military needs to permanent restoration projects. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and with the strong cooperation of railway workers from various railway bureaus and the guidance of socialist advanced technical experience from Soviet experts, all commanders and fighters of the Railway Engineering Corps, with a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm, worked actively. They have basically permanently restored the main bridges and culverts on the major railway lines across the country (excluding the Northeast); and completed a number of new construction and restoration projects for lines, water supply, communications, signaling, and station buildings. This ensured smooth and safe transportation on the Beijing-Hankou, Longhai, and Yuehan main lines, as well as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Tongpu North sections, during the flood season. This played a significant role in national economic construction and national defense.
　　According to statistics from the end of November 1950, last year, 257 large, medium, and small regular bridges were permanently repaired, extending the railway by 11,946 meters; line construction involved 146 kilometers of main and side lines, 410,470 cubic meters of earth and stonework, 6,610 cubic meters of concrete and masonry protection, and 78,920 cubic meters of rubble filling; communications projects included 13,868 kilometers of new wires and 12,902 new utility poles. In addition, various construction projects such as station buildings, water supply, and signaling were carried out.
　　In carrying out the above-mentioned arduous task of permanent restoration, the commanders and fighters of the entire corps, with unparalleled spirit of hard work, braved the cold wind, treaded through accumulated snow, broke through solid ice, and went down into the freezing river water to dig foundations, build cofferdams, wash gravel, build cement piers, and erect steel beams... In April, the Yuehan line was approaching the rainy season, and the river water was rising sharply. The soldiers put forward the slogan "Conquer the floods and ensure traffic," working day and night to speed up the repairs. The floods were finally defeated by the heroes. In early May, all fourteen regular bridges, including the Qujiang bridge on the Yuehan line, were completely repaired, and completed several days to dozens of days ahead of the original plan. All commanders and fighters and employees who participated in this project received a commendation telegram from Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways. More than ninety regular bridges on the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai main lines were also fully repaired before the end of June. The famous Luohe Railway Bridge was repaired and opened to traffic eleven days ahead of schedule due to the active efforts of the soldiers. The restoration project of 114 kilometers of lines and 132 bridges and culverts on the northern section of the Tongpu Railway started on March 20, and was completed and opened to traffic by the end of May in just over two months, thanks to the concerted efforts of the soldiers and employees. After most of the bridge projects were completed, the corps extracted a portion of its forces and successively completed three huge drainage tunnels and three water damage protection projects in the western section of the Longhai Railway in August and mid-September, over several months. The communications troops of the corps climbed mountains and crossed rivers, working hard, and installed as many as 13,800 kilometers of new wires. Over the past year, from the northern section of the Tongpu Railway in the north to the mouth of the Pearl River in the south, from Baoji, Shaanxi in the west to the coast in the east, the people's railway fighters have created brilliant achievements on every major railway line in Guannei.
　　Many of the personnel in the Railway Engineering Corps were originally soldiers who killed enemies with guns, and now they have become skilled construction workers. Because, in the process of the project, they constantly launched a movement to learn technology. Through learning methods such as "learning while working," "apprenticeship," signing "master-apprentice contracts," giving technical lessons, and running training courses, the soldiers' technical level and work efficiency were continuously improved, and they initially learned to master modern mechanical equipment. Due to the soldiers' active and enthusiastic study and learning of technology, a large number of specialized technicians and semi-skilled workers emerged this year. This not only guaranteed the better completion of the project tasks, but also moved this powerful technical service further towards modernization and correctness. In various tasks, technical democracy was promoted, everyone came up with ideas and methods, gave play to the wisdom of the masses, rationally organized the labor force, and created and improved new tools and new working methods, which also played an active role in completing the project tasks. A certain brigade had as many as 99 rationalization proposals, large and small, in its work in just one month, and 55 of them were adopted; inventions and creations were too numerous to mention. Comrade Zhao Enpu of the Communications Corps created a pole turning device, which increased work efficiency by 24 times; Comrades Jin Zengren and Li Yongxin of a certain unit used pile drivers instead of cranes, and the work efficiency was increased by six to seven times compared with manual labor; Comrade Sun Xuekong of a certain unit made his own washing bed; the Fourth Company of a certain unit made its own track lifting machine; in the three drainage tunnel projects, Comrade Yang Zhende transformed a small flatcar to transport soil, increasing work efficiency by more than four times.
　　In the "movement to cherish materials and tools," the soldiers showed excellent qualities of patriotism. A certain unit responsible for the restoration project of various bridges on the Longhai Railway saved a total of 21 steel beams, weighing more than 1,500 tons; the bridge repair troops working on the Beijing-Hankou Railway salvaged 11 and three-quarters more steel beams than planned, weighing a total of 382 tons, and collected more than 8 tons of scrap steel rails, 1.5 tons of steel bars, and four bridge piers in the Shahe Bridge alone; a certain unit that repaired bridges on the Yuehan Railway received a bonus of more than 100 million yuan from the railway bureau due to its love for materials. The soldiers cherished tools and materials as they cherished their own bodies. Many soldiers wrote their names on the tools, wiped them clean after work, and hung them up like guns. In the gaps between work, everyone actively collected materials scattered on the site and along the line, saving a lot of expenses for the country. The Third Company of a certain unit collected more than 5,600 pieces of materials of various sizes in just five days, equivalent to more than 18,000 jin of millet.
　　Due to the active efforts of all the comrades of the entire corps, in the meritorious service campaign, in the first, second, and third quarters alone, 2,611 heroes and models, large and small, emerged with Yang Liandi, Wang Zhilin, Li Wenzhu, Zhao Zhicheng, and He Jinshan as the banner, and a large number of commanders and fighters were commended and rewarded. The Second Company of the Bridge Brigade of a certain unit created the highest record of 41.44 tons of bridge erection in eight hours during the Luohe Bridge project, and the entire company received a collective meritorious service award. In the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend the country, the soldiers successively made plans, expressed their determination, and wrote to Chairman Mao and the leaders at all levels of the corps, unanimously expressing their willingness to strengthen national defense with practical actions to complete their tasks. Yang Liandi, the well-known Denggao hero of Bridge No. 8, said: We will resolutely complete the tasks assigned by the superiors and are determined to strive to join the party in the arduous struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The soldiers said in their letter to Chairman Mao: "Respected Chairman Mao: We have made all the preparations in our current work positions and are ready to welcome the new tasks you give us." Under the enthusiastic encouragement of all commanders and fighters to love the motherland and resist the aggression of American imperialism, work efficiency is constantly improving on every site.

　　铁道兵团在一九五零年中的辉煌成绩
    宋树栋
    一九五○年一年中，我国的铁路工程建设，已由适应军事需要的临时抢修转入永久修复工程。铁道兵团在毛主席和中央人民政府、人民革命军事委员会的正确领导下，并得到了各路局铁路员工有力的配合和苏联专家社会主义先进技术经验的指导，一年以来，全体指战员以高度的爱国主义的劳动热情，积极工作，已基本上永久修复了全国铁路各大干线（东北除外）上的主要桥梁和涵洞；并完成了一部线路、给水、通讯、信号和车站建筑的新建和修复工程。保证了京汉、陇海、粤汉三大干线及浙赣、同蒲北段等路在洪水期中运输的畅通与安全。在国家经济建设和国防建设上，都起到了重大的作用。
    根据一九五○年十一月底的统计，去年工程永久修复大、中、小正桥二百五十七座，修复部分使铁路延长达一万一千九百四十六公尺；线路工程修建正侧线一百四十六公里，作土石方四十一万零四百七十方，作混凝土砌片石防护六千六百一十方，投填片石七万八千九百二十方；通讯工程，新设电线一万三千八百六十八条公里、新设电杆一万二千九百零二根。另外，并进行了车站房屋、给水、信号等各种建筑工程。
    在执行上述永久复旧的艰巨工程任务中，全兵团的指战员以无比艰苦的精神，冒着寒风，踏着积雪，冲破坚冰，下到刺骨河水里，挖基础，作围堰，洗石子，打洋灰墩，架钢梁……。四月份，粤汉线已接近雨季，江水暴涨，战士们提出了“战胜洪水，保证通车”的口号，不分昼夜地加紧赶修，洪水终于被英雄们战胜了。五月初旬，粤汉路上的曲江等十四座正桥全部修复，并较原计划提前数日到数十日完工。参加这项工程的全体指战员和员工，得到了铁道部滕代远部长的电令嘉奖。京汉、陇海两大干线上的九十余座正桥，也在六月底前全部修复。有名的洛河大铁桥在战士们的积极努力下，以两个月的时间提前十一天修复通车。同蒲路北段的线路一百一十四公里、桥涵一百三十二座的修复工程，自三月二十日开工，在战士和员工一致努力下，以两个多月的时间，在五月底全部完工通车。在各桥梁工程大部完成后，该兵团又抽出一部分力量，以数月的时间，在八月底和九月中旬相继完成了陇海路西段巨大的三处排水隧道和三处水害防护工程。该兵团通讯部队，爬山涉水，艰苦工作，从华北到两广，新设电线长达一万三千八百余条公里。一年来，北起同蒲路北段，南达珠江口，西自陕西宝鸡，东到海边，人民的铁道战士们，在关内每一条铁路干线上创造了辉煌的成绩。
    铁道兵团的很多人员，原来都是拿枪杀敌的战士，现在都成了技术熟练的修建工人，因为，在工程进行中，他们曾不断展开了学技术运动，通过“边作边学”、“拜师傅带徒弟”、订“师徒合同”、讲技术课、开办训练班等学习方法，使战士们的技术水平和工作效率不断地提高，并初步地学会了掌握现代化的机械设备。由于战士们积极热情地钻研和学习技术，在这一年中，出现了大批的各种专门技术工和半熟练工。不但保证了更好地完成了工程任务，而且把这支强大的技术兵种更向现代和正确化推进了一步。在各种工作当中，都发扬了技术民主，大家出主意想办法，发挥了群众的智慧，合理地组织了劳动力，创造和改进新工具和新的工作方法等，在完成工程任务上，也起了积极的推动作用。某大队仅在一个月中，即有工作上的大小合理化建议九十九件，经采用的达五十五件；创造发明更不胜枚举。通讯部队的赵恩普同志创造了转杆器，提高工作效率二十四倍；某部金曾仁、李永信二位同志，用打桩机代替起重机，工作效率较用人力提高六、七倍；某部孙学孔同志自造洗床；某部四连自造起道机；在三处排水隧道工程中，杨振德同志改造小平车运土，提高工作效率四倍以上。
    在“爱护材料和工具的运动”中，战士们表现了爱国主义的优良品质。担任陇海路各桥修复工程的某部，共节省了钢梁二十一孔，计重一千五百余吨；在京汉路工作的修桥部队，超过计划多打捞了十一又四分之三孔钢梁，共重三百八十二吨、仅沙河桥一处即搜集废钢轨八吨多、钢筋一吨半、桥台四个；在粤汉路修桥的某部，由于对材料的爱护，曾得到路局奖金一亿余元。战士们象爱护自己的身体一样地爱护着工具和材料。许多战士在工具上写上自己的名字，下工后，擦干净了，象枪一样地挂起来。在工作空隙中，大家主动地搜集丢散在现场上和沿线的材料，为国家节省了不少的开支。某部三中队仅在五天内，即搜集了大小材料五千六百多件，折合小米一万八千余斤。
    由于全兵团的同志们的积极努力，在立功运动中，仅一、二、三三个季度里，即涌现了以杨连第、王志林、李文柱、赵志诚、何金山等英雄模范为旗帜的大小功臣两千六百一十一名，并有大批的指战员受到了表扬和奖励。某部桥梁大队二连洛河桥工程中创造八小时拚桥四十一点四四吨的最高纪录，全连得到了集体立功的奖励。战士们在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，纷纷订计划、表决心、上书毛主席和兵团各级首长，一致表示，愿以完成任务的实际行动来增强国防力量。全国闻名的八号桥登高英雄杨连第表示：坚决完成上级所给予的任务，决心在抗美援朝的艰巨斗争中争取入党。战士们给毛主席的信上说：“敬爱的毛主席：我们在现在的工作岗位上已作好了一切的准备工作，准备随时迎接你所给予我们的新任务。”全体指战员在热爱祖国、抵抗美帝国主义侵略的热情鼓舞下，在每个现场上，工作效率都在不断地提高着。
