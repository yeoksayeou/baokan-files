　　New Atmosphere in Shuanghuaishu Village, Suburbs of Beijing
　　Shi Yan
　　After the land reform, the peasants of Shuanghuaishu Village in the western suburbs of Beijing, after a year of intensive labor, have obtained abundant fruits: the village produced a total of 13,727 *shi* of grain last year, 3,248 *shi* more than the previous year, and 2,437 *shi* more than in normal years. The newly liberated poor peasants and farm laborers are generally able to eat enough, and a few even have surplus grain; the middle peasants generally have surplus grain.
　　When the cooperative in the village just started the autumn harvest, it only sold goods worth 500,000 to 600,000 yuan per day, but in October (after the autumn harvest), the daily sales increased to about 2 million yuan. In the past, those who went to the sand pits to sift sand during the slack season brought cornbread and sweet potatoes, but now they bring white flour pancakes. Poor peasant Zhang Guozhu happily said: "In the past, we only ate corn flour, and it had to be thin; now, we not only have two dry meals a day, but we also eat a meal of white flour every three to five days." In previous years, when winter came, the poor peasants and farm laborers would patch up their ragged cotton clothes that they had worn for several years and make do with them for the winter; now, many people have replaced them with new cotton clothes. Many families have repaired their old houses, and a few have even built new houses.
　　Farmers with surplus grain are preparing to expand production this year: after the autumn harvest last year, more than 20 farmers in the village bought five mules, fifteen donkeys, and nine carts. Some are now repairing carts and farm tools; some are planning to dig wells and buy waterwheels to continue to turn dry land into paddy fields; some have bought reeds to build windbreaks on the edge of the gardens or to build hotbeds in the gardens to grow fine vegetables.
　　I made a special visit to Wang Deyuan, a liberated farm laborer. A year ago, he truly had "not a single room, not a single piece of land," and relied entirely on his three sons to earn money for food. He was constantly threatened by hunger, "worrying about the next meal after eating this one." During the land reform, he was allocated 13.1 *mu* of dry land and 3.3 *mu* of irrigated land, and harvested a total of 48 *shi* of grain. Not only could his family of six eat well and dress warmly, but he also used his surplus grain to buy a mule and planned to buy another cart, and planned to turn eight *mu* of dry land into irrigated land this spring. Wang Deyuan's family's life is a typical example of the liberated peasants in the suburbs of Beijing moving towards prosperity.
　　These beautiful fruits are not easily obtained.
　　In the winter before last, after the land was transferred to the peasants, the peasants' enthusiasm for production generally increased. Many more people were picking manure, and those who pulled carts or drove carts into the city to pull furnace ash and ditch mud never stopped from the previous winter to last spring. Some even worked day and night, such as farm laborer Chen Yonggui, who sold what he pulled during the day to make a living, and put what he pulled at night on his own land. Gao Kunyu picked out even small stones in his field; Wang Deyuan leveled the newly allocated uneven dry land and turned it into irrigated land; Chen Yungui dug ditches on the edge of the sweet potato ridges and applied manure, and the sweet potatoes grew particularly large. They all knew: "Diligent people don't have lazy land. As long as you put effort into tidying it up, it can produce more grain for you."
　　The peasants are very grateful to the People's Government for its help in their production. Last spring, the newly liberated peasants lacked capital, and the People's Government lent them more than 23,000 *jin* of millet, which solved some of their difficulties.
　　At the same time, the promotion of the Victory No. 100 superior sweet potato variety also played a significant role in increasing production. Before last year, most people planted local varieties, with an average yield of 1,500 *jin* per *mu*. Last year, under the call of the People's Government, almost all of them planted Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes, with an average yield of more than 2,000 *jin* per *mu*. Those who planted particularly well, such as Deng Fuyuan, the director of the farmers' association, planted 2.2 *mu* of sweet potatoes and produced more than 13,000 *jin*.
　　There are many graves of feudal landlords in Shuanghuaishu Village, and in addition to the graves, they also occupy large areas of land, which are barren and cannot be used for production. In the past, peasants had no land to cultivate and dared not open it up. Even if they did, they were often seized by the landlords. For example, during the Japanese rule, the peasants of Zhengwang Tomb opened up more than 100 *mu* of land, which was all forcibly occupied by the local tyrant and landlord Guan Changfu. Last year, under the People's Government's policy of rewarding land reclamation, a total of more than 130 *mu* of wasteland was opened up, which also played a role in increasing production.
　　The peasants of Shuanghuaishu still clearly remember the most brutal years of Japanese rule in Beijing. At that time, those who farmed had to line up in front of the grain store every day, waiting to buy the mixed flour "distributed" by the Japanese. After the Kuomintang returned to Beijing for the second time, it brought even greater suffering to the people. Not to mention anything else, just the conscription alone made the peasants restless. It was not until the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army came that they ended their miserable lives.
　　When they heard the news that American imperialism had invaded our Taiwan and ignited the flames of aggression in Korea, burning all the way to our northeastern border, they were furious. They are determined to respond to the aggression of American imperialism with practical actions of "doing a good job in winter production and supporting the Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea." Some are using rotten vegetable leaves to make manure, and some are driving carts to the city to clean up furnace ash and road soil, all in preparation for fertilizer for this year's major production. More than 200 people have gone to the sand pits to sift sand. An ordinary laborer can earn one *dou* of corn per day, and five or six *shi* of corn in one winter. Selling vegetables, selling yellow soil, and carrying bricks at the kiln can also earn ten *jin* of corn per person per day, and three or four *shi* of grain in one winter.
　　In the year after liberation, the peasants of Shuanghuaishu have already won a victory on the production line. Based on this victory, they will surely achieve greater victories in this year's major production campaign.

　　京郊双槐树村的新气象
    石岩
    土地改革后，北京西郊双槐树的农民，经过一年紧张的劳动，获得了丰富的果实：全村去年共产粮一万三千七百二十七石，比前年多打三千二百四十八石粮；比常年多打二千四百三十七石粮。新翻身的贫雇农，大都已经够吃，少数还有了余粮；中农则一般的都有了余粮。
    该村合作社秋收刚开始时，每天只卖出货物五六十万元，进入十月（秋收后）每天售货就增至二百万元左右。以前，农闲时到沙子坑去筛沙子的，都是带窝窝头和白薯，现在都带上了白面烙饼。贫农张国柱愉快地说：“前年光吃棒子面，还得吃稀的；现在，我们不但一天两顿干的，每隔三五天还吃一顿白面。”往年，贫雇农到冬季，都是把穿过好几年的破烂棉衣，缝补一下，凑合着过冬；现在，好多人都换上了新棉衣。不少人家把旧房子修理一下，有几户还盖了新房。
    有余粮的农民，准备今年扩大生产：去年秋收以后，全村即有二十多户农民买了五头骡子，十五头毛驴，九辆大车。现在有的正在修车修农具；有的计划打井、买水车，继续变旱地为水地；有的买了苇子，要在园地边夹风障或在园地上打阳畦种细菜。
    我特别去访问一家翻身雇农王德元。一年前，他真是“房无一间，地无一垅”，完全靠他三个儿子卖力气挣钱吃饭。“吃了上顿愁下顿”，饥饿经常威胁着他们。土地改革时他分得十三亩一分旱地、三亩三分水浇地，共收获了四十八石粮，不仅全家六口人吃得饱穿得暖，还用余粮买了一头骡子，打算再买一辆大车，并计划今年春天变八亩旱地为水浇地。王德元家的生活就是京郊翻身农民走向富裕的一个典型例子。
    这美好的果实，不是轻轻易易得来的。
    前年冬季，土地转移到农民手里后，农民生产的积极性普遍高涨起来。拣粪的人增加了很多，拉了排子车或赶着大车进城去拉炉灰沟泥的，从前冬到去春就没间断过，有的甚至昼夜不停，如雇农陈永贵，白天拉的卖了维持生活，晚上拉的上到自己地里。高昆玉地里有个小石子都要捡出来；王德元把新分的高低不平的旱地，收拾平匀，改成水浇地；陈云贵在白薯埂边开沟拦上粪，白薯长得特别大。他们都知道：“人勤地不懒，只要你用工夫去收拾它，它就能给你多出产粮食。”
    农民对人民政府在他们生产上的帮助，是很感谢的。去年春天，新翻身的农民缺乏资本，人民政府即贷给二万三千多斤小米，解决了一部分困难。
    同时推广胜利一百号优良品种白薯，在增产上也起了不小的作用。前年，一般的都种本地品种，每亩产量一千五百斤。去年经人民政府号召推广，几乎全部种了胜利一百号白薯，每亩产量都在两千斤以上，种得特别好的，每亩竟产五六千斤，如农会主任邓福元，种了二亩二分白薯，出了一万三千多斤。
    双槐树村封建地主家的坟地很多，坟墓以外还占着大片土地，荒废着不能生产。在以前，农民没有地种，也不敢开，即使开垦出来，也往往被地主所霸占。如日本统治时期，郑王坟农民曾开出百来亩地，全被恶霸地主关长福所强占。去年，在人民政府奖励开荒的政策下，共开荒一百三十余亩，这对增加生产上，也有其作用。
    双槐树的农民都还清醒的记着日本鬼子统治北京最残酷的年头，那时种地的人，每天在粮店门前排着队，等候着买日本人“配给”的混合面。国民党二次回到北京以后，带给人民的更大的苦痛，别的不用提了，单是抓兵一项，就把农民搅得坐卧不安。一直到共产党和人民解放军来了，才使他们结束了悲惨的生活。
    当他们听到美帝国主义侵略了我们的台湾，又在朝鲜点燃了侵略的战火，一直向我国东北边境燃烧的消息时，他们愤怒了。他们决心以“搞好冬季生产，支援志愿援朝部队”的实际行动来回答美帝国主义的侵略。有的用烂菜叶沤粪，有的赶了大车去市内去打扫炉灰道土，都在预备今年大生产的肥料。已有二百多人到沙子坑去筛沙子，一个普通的劳动力，每天可挣一斗玉米，一个冬季，就能挣五、六石玉米。卖菜、卖黄土、上窑背砖，每天每人也能挣十来斤玉米，一冬天可挣三、四石粮食。
    解放后一年，双槐树的农民，已经在生产线上打了一个胜仗，在这一胜利的基础上，今年他们在大生产运动中一定会取得更大的胜利。
