　　Cadre Meeting of the Trade Union of Principals of Middle Schools and Church Schools in Beijing
　　Discussing the Elimination of the Influence of American Imperialist Cultural Aggression; Beijing Primary and Secondary School Teachers Prepare to Strengthen the Study of Current Affairs and Politics During the Winter Vacation
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union convened a meeting of cadres from middle schools and church schools in Beijing on the 25th. Principals of various schools were also invited to participate. The meeting discussed how to thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialism's cultural aggression in church schools.
    After Chairman Qian Duansheng explained the significance of the meeting, Wen Hanjiang spoke on behalf of the Municipal Trade Union, calling on trade union members to combine the current victorious situation with the State Council's decision on handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups accepting American subsidies during the winter vacation, and to further conduct in-depth patriotic study against American imperialist aggression. Schools can first deliberate through listening to reports and informal discussions, and then, in combination with the specific conditions and needs of each school, appropriately use accusation meetings, grievance meetings, etc., to further enlighten thinking, and then, based on the consciousness and voluntariness of teachers and staff, lead them to conduct a ideological recollection and ideological review, in order to further eradicate the political influence left by long-term aggression by imperialism, especially American imperialism. This call was unanimously approved by the administration and trade unions of various schools.
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Study Committee issued a notice, calling on the school district study committees and teachers and staff of various schools in Beijing to use the winter vacation to conduct current affairs and political studies in preparation for teaching work in the next semester. The notice pointed out that in the past year, especially in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, middle and primary school teachers in Beijing actively participated in study and propaganda activities, which significantly improved their political understanding and improved their work in many ways. The notice said: Teachers should use the winter vacation to study current affairs and politics through self-study, and persist in the habit of regularly reading newspapers and studying current affairs. By analyzing the new situation and new victories, we should examine our thinking, strengthen our understanding, and improve our awareness.
    The notice also called on teachers to conduct teaching preparation work during the winter vacation, appropriately summarize past teaching experience, especially the experience of conducting patriotic education; and on this basis, prepare and plan for the next semester's teaching work based on the situation and facts of the great victories of the motherland's construction and the great victories of resisting America and aiding Korea. Trade unions and study committees of various schools should specifically help teachers conduct current affairs and political studies and teaching preparation work during the winter vacation.
    The notice mentioned that the Municipal Study Committee will hold several political and professional learning lectures during the vacation, and teachers and staff of various schools can participate freely.
