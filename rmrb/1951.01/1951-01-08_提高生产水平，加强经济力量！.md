The Public and Private Cotton Textile Factories in the Southwest Region Improve Operations, Production Gradually Recovers
    [Report from New China News Agency] The public and private cotton textile industry in the Southwest region, which had been in serious loss and contraction, has gradually recovered. From September to November, the number of spindles rotating in public and private yarn factories in the region was 227,000, reaching 94% of the total equipment, an increase of 36% compared to January. Since September, the production and sales of various yarn factories have tended to be balanced, and sales in October increased by nearly 30% compared with September. The weekly operating rate of various yarn factories has returned to the normal state of six days and nights. At present, most factories have gradually reached the break-even point or have obtained a surplus.
    Starting in April 1950, the People's Governments and Cotton Yarn and Cloth Companies in various parts of the Southwest provided raw cotton to the factories for commissioned processing and spinning, and purchased products and adjusted yarn prices to help the cotton textile industry solve the difficulties in production and sales. For example, by the end of November, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company had allocated a total of 260,000 dan of raw cotton to various factories for processing and spinning, and appropriately raised the yarn price from 4 million yuan per piece in early May to 6.3 million yuan, allowing the factories to maintain production.
    As rural promotion work is gradually carried out, the demand for yarn and cloth is rapidly increasing. The Southwest cotton textile industry has overcome difficulties and is moving towards a new life.

Tianjin Public Industrial Production Level Significantly Improved Last Year Compared to the Previous Year
    [Report from New China News Agency] In 1950, the production level of Tianjin's public industries greatly exceeded that of 1949. Major industrial products such as steel ingots, wire rods, electrodes, transformers, lead wire, chemical industrial products, yarn, cloth, paper, and tobacco have all completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded the targets. Compared with 1949, the production of steel ingots, wire rods, electrodes, and other products increased by 2.5 to 6.5 times, transformers increased by 14 times, paper increased by one time, and cotton cloth and yarn increased by 37% to 42% respectively, becoming a new record in the annual output of Tianjin's public cotton textile factories. The quality of the products of various factories also improved significantly last year. The secondary products of steel ingots and wire rods made last year were equivalent to the primary products of 1949; the rate of first-class cloth in Tianjin's state-owned cotton textile factories also increased from 90.99% in 1949 to 96.76% in 1950.

Tianjin Private Industrial Overcomes Difficulties and Begins to Move Steadily Towards Normal Development
    [Report from New China News Agency] Over the past year, Tianjin's private industry has overcome the difficulties of product stagnation and has begun to move steadily towards normal development. According to statistics at the end of December last year, the number of private industrial households in the city increased by 5.88% compared with the end of December of the previous year, and the number of employees increased by 10.26%. Power has also increased compared to before. In September last year, the city's electricity consumption for public and private industries increased by 25% compared with September of the previous year.
    After prices stabilized in March and April last year, with the disappearance of false social purchasing power, Tianjin's private industry experienced temporary difficulties. From April to June, the number of factories that closed down each month was more than double the number of factories that opened; the match and cigarette industries, which had blindly developed, were largely shut down or half-shut down. After vigorous adjustments by the People's Government, coupled with the increase in rural purchasing power after the wheat harvest, most industries gradually improved starting in July. From July to September, the number of households opening each month was more than double the number of households closing. The blindness of new openings was greatly reduced compared to before March, and funds and power were also more abundant. The city's opening funds in the second half of the year increased by more than one time compared to the first half of the year. The horsepower of new openings in October increased by nearly three times compared with April and May, and the number of opening personnel increased by three times. Among them, industries such as machinery, hardware smelting, hardware wire making, and electrical equipment, which are urgently needed for national economic construction, have seen particularly significant improvements in production. Larger factories in the machinery industry have exerted their full production capacity, and the production capacity of general medium and small factories has also exerted more than 80%. The manufacturing of machine tools, which had been stopped for many years, has also begun to recover. In the midst of improvement, the quantity and quality of products from many factories have also improved significantly.
    The main reason for the normal development of Tianjin's private industry is that the Tianjin Municipal People's Government correctly implemented the policies of the Central People's Government and appropriately adjusted the relationship between industry and commerce and between the public and private sectors. When the city's industry and commerce encountered difficulties in March and April this year, the Municipal People's Government promptly proposed the slogan "Labor and Management Cooperate to Overcome Difficulties," and adopted the Interim Guidelines for Public and Private Enterprises to Sign Processing, Sales, Ordering, and Agency Business Contracts at the People's Congress, and established a Public-Private Relations Adjustment Committee to adjust the relationship between the public and private sectors. The Municipal Finance Committee made appropriate adjustments to the operating scope, raw material supply, and sales market between public and private enterprises. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce also guided various factories to improve operations, improve technology, and organize joint ventures. State-owned enterprises vigorously supported private enterprises through commissioned processing, ordering, and purchasing. State-owned enterprises purchased a large number of stagnant products from private factories, solving the difficulties of many factories with inflexible capital turnover. The People's Bank also issued a large number of loans to support private enterprises in a focused manner.
    Secondly, the workers of various factories responded to the government's call and came up with many concrete ways to maintain production; many factory workers also voluntarily reduced their wages and benefits to help the capitalists overcome difficulties. Some capitalists also actively improved operations and changed their business policies. These have also played a considerable role in the normal development of private industry.

Gejiu Tin Mine in Yunnan Province Completed the Plan 27 Days Ahead of Schedule
    [Report from New China News Agency] Production at the Gejiu Tin Mine of Yunnan Tin Industry Company completed the national plan ahead of schedule on December 3rd last year. Before liberation, thanks to the heroic protection of the factory by the employees, Chiang Kai-shek's troops failed to destroy it before fleeing. In March last year, the Tin Industry Company began to take over, and immediately resumed production while taking stock. The employees spent three months rushing to complete various expansion projects. After eight months of efforts, they constantly overcame various difficulties and successfully completed the production tasks given by the state ahead of schedule.

All Mines Under Jingxing Mining Bureau Completed the Annual Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    [Report from New China News Agency] All mines under the Jingxing Mining Bureau completed the annual production task ahead of schedule on December 12th. The annual output increased by 49% compared to the previous year. Labor productivity has reached an average of 0.622 or more for the whole year's plan, which is more than 41% higher than in 1948. There has been significant progress in safety. Serious injuries have decreased by 77.2% compared to the previous year, and deaths have decreased by 58.4% compared to 1948. Mines No. 4 and No. 5 have created a safety record of no deaths for two years, and have completely eliminated work-related injuries in the recent two months. The cost was reduced by 5.79% compared to the planned quota, saving the country 3.8 million catties of millet.

    提高生产水平，加强经济力量！
　　西南区公私营棉纺织厂改善经营生产日渐恢复
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：曾陷于严重亏损萎缩的西南区公私营棉纺业已日渐恢复。全区公私营纱厂自九月份起至十一月份期间转动的纱锭为二十二万七千枚，达全部设备数的百分之九十四，比一月份增加了百分之三十六。自九月份起各纱厂产销已趋平衡，十月份销量又较九月增加近百分之三十。各纱厂每周开工率已恢复到六日夜的正常状态。目前大部工厂已逐渐达到保本或已获得盈余。
    从一九五○年四月份开始，西南各地人民政府和花纱布公司一面以原棉供应各厂，委托加工代纺；一面又收购产品，调整纱价，帮助棉纺业解决产销上的困难。如花纱布公司至十一月份止即共拨给各厂加工代纺原棉达二十六万担，并将纱价由五月初每件四百万元适当地提到六百三十万元，使各厂维持了生产。
    由于农村推销工作逐步开展，纱布需要量正迅速增加。西南棉纺业已度过困难走向新生。
　　天津公营工业生产水平去年比前年有显著提高
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：一九五零年天津市公营工业的生产水平大大超过一九四九年。主要工业产品如钢锭、盘条、电极、变压器、铅丝、化学工业产品、纱、布、纸、烟草等数十种产品都已提前超额完成了全年生产计划。和一九四九年比较，钢锭、盘条、电极等产品增加二倍半到六倍半，变压器增加十四倍，纸张增加一倍，棉布和纱亦分别增加了百分之三十七到百分之四十二，成为津市公营棉纺织厂年产量有史以来的新纪录。各厂产品的质量，去年也有显著提高。去年所制的钢锭、盘条等的二级品相当于一九四九年的一级品；天津各国营棉纺织厂的正布率也由一九四九年的百分之九十点九九上升到一九五○年的百分之九十六点七六。
　　天津私营工业克服困难开始稳步走向正常发展
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：天津市私营工业一年来克服了产品滞销的困难，开始稳步走向正常发展的道路。据去年十二月底统计，全市私营工业户数较前年十二月底增加百分之五点八八，职工人数增加百分之一○点二六。动力也较前增加。去年九月份全市公私工业用电量较前年九月份增加了百分之二十五。
    去年三、四月间物价稳定后，随着社会虚假购买力的消失，津市私营工业出现了暂时的困难。四月到六月每月歇业工厂户数较开业户数多一倍以上；火柴、卷烟等盲目发展起来的行业，大部工厂陷于停工或半停工状态。经过人民政府的大力调整，加之麦收后农村购买力提高，自七月份起大部行业即陆续好转。从七月到九月每月开业户数较歇业户数多一倍以上。新开业者比三月份以前盲目性大大减少，资金、动力亦较充裕。全市下半年开业资金较上半年增加一倍以上。十月份新开业的马力较四、五月份增加近三倍，开业人员增加了三倍。其中机器、五金冶制、五金线制、电工器材等为国家经济建设迫切需要的行业，生产情况的好转尤其显著。机器业较大的工厂已发挥了全部生产力，一般中、小工厂的生产力也发挥了百分之八十以上。停止了多年的工作母机的制造，也开始恢复。好转中不少工厂产品的数量、质量，也有显著提高。
    天津市私营工业的进入正常发展，主要原因是津市人民政府正确地执行了中央人民政府的政策，适当调整了工商业和公私关系。在今年三、四月间该市工商业发生困难时，市人民政府曾及时提出“劳资协力克服困难”的号召，并在人民代表会议上通过了公私企业间订立加工包销定货代理业务契约暂行准则，成立了公私关系调整委员会以调整公私关系。市府财委会对公私企业间在经营范围、原料供给、销售市场等方面作了适当的调整。市工商局并指导各厂改善经营，提高技术，组织联营等。各国营企业，则大力以委托加工、定货和收购等办法扶助私营企业。国营企业收购了私营工厂大批滞销品，解决了不少工厂资金周转不灵等困难。人民银行也发放大量贷款，有重点地扶助私营企业。
    其次，各厂工人响应政府号召，想出很多具体办法，维持生产；不少工厂工人并自动减低工资待遇，协助资方克服困难。部分资方也积极改善经营，改变营业方针。这些对于私营工业的正常发展，也都起了相当的作用。
