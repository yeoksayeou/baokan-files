Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch, TASS: West German "German News Agency" broadcast on the 15th a statement by Bonn "Chancellor" Adenauer at a press conference. In the statement, Adenauer rejected the proposal by German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl to achieve German unification.

Grotewohl's proposal, which Adenauer had received a month and a half ago, received unanimous support from all sectors of West German society, not to mention the support of the people of the German Democratic Republic. This situation forced Adenauer to painstakingly delay his reply, pretending to "carefully" study Grotewohl's letter with members of the Bonn government and parliamentarians. During this month and a half, Adenauer also constantly consulted with the U.S. and British High Commissioners in Germany.

In his statement at the press conference, Adenauer, taking into account the sentiments of the West German residents, tried his best to portray his "government" as a supporter of German unification. He hypocritically insisted that "all efforts of the Federal Government are aimed at restoring the unity of Germany," even though everyone knows that the very fact that the Western occupying powers established this "government" is an act by U.S. and British imperialists, using their Bonn puppet, to divide Germany.

### 在美英分裂德国阴谋下  阿登纳拒绝统一提议

　　在美英分裂德国阴谋下
    阿登纳拒绝统一提议
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：西德“德意志新闻社”十五日广播波恩“总理”阿登纳在记者招待会上的声明。阿登纳在声明中拒绝了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥关于达成德国统一的提议。
    阿登纳在一个半月以前就已接到的格罗提渥的提议，得到了西德各界人士一致的支持，而德意志民主共和国人民的支持，就更不待言了。这种情况使阿登纳费尽心机，拖延回答，装模作样地与波恩政府人士和议会议员“仔细”研究格罗提渥的信。在这一个半月中，阿登纳还曾不断地向美英驻德高级专员请示。
    阿登纳在记者招待会上的声明中，因为考虑到西德居民的情绪，乃千方百计地力图把自己的“政府”说成是德国统一的拥护者。他绝顶虚伪地硬说“联邦政府的一切努力都是为了恢复德国的统一”，虽然人人都知道，西方占领国建立这个“政府”这一事实的本身，就是美英帝国主义者以其波恩傀儡分裂德国的一个行动。
