　　Newspapers Teach Us About Love and Hate
　　National Beijing Institute of Heavy Industry Liu Ruihua
　　We, the more than 800 teachers, students, and staff of the National Beijing Institute of Heavy Industry, have formed a total of 80 newspaper reading groups. The school administration and the comrades of the Student Life Guidance Section are very concerned about the students' newspaper study, stipulating one hour each day for newspaper study time. Furthermore, designated personnel are responsible for marking the key points of the day's newspaper study with red and blue pens. Each group then conducts informal discussions and reading according to the announced key points.
　　When we first started reading the newspapers, some students lacked a correct understanding of the newspaper reading groups and were therefore not very interested. They only participated because everyone else was reading the newspaper and they were embarrassed not to join the reading group. Some people even dozed off while reading the newspaper. Because everyone's enthusiasm for studying the newspaper was not high and they had not developed the habit of reading the newspaper, the gains were not great. In order to stimulate everyone's learning, the school administration held the first current affairs test. The test results showed that half of the students failed. Some people even answered that Nehru was British. Therefore, everyone felt that they were not paying enough attention to current affairs. The Communist Youth League branches and study group leaders in each class then led the students to discuss how to attach importance to reading the newspaper and doing a good job in current affairs study. Many classes organized current affairs groups to lead the students in their class to read the newspaper, help the students solve difficulties in newspaper study, and frequently solicit everyone's opinions to improve study methods. Based on newspapers and magazines, the current affairs groups systematically, analytically, and comprehensively summarized major domestic and international political events every half month or month to assist students in their studies. Some current affairs groups even created current affairs games. For example, the fourth grade of the mechanical engineering department wrote some current affairs questions they had collected on small slips of paper. During the game, whoever lost would be asked to draw a question for everyone to answer. In this way, everyone not only happily played the game, but also reviewed current affairs. Sometimes, they also used their spare time to hold informal discussion meetings. Before reading the newspaper, simple outlines of the day's important reports were written on the blackboard, and simple maps were drawn when necessary. In addition to collective newspaper reading, students also used their spare time to carefully read the newspaper's editorials and reports in the spirit of "self-study as the mainstay."
　　Since the establishment of the newspaper reading groups, everyone has developed a good habit of reading the newspaper over the past year, which has improved the students' political level. They deeply feel the loveliness of our great motherland. Most importantly, they have recognized the despicable and shameless cruel atrocities of imperialism and its running dogs. Especially since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland movement, the students have realized the importance of current affairs study, and everyone feels that not reading the newspaper for a day is like lacking something important. Indeed, the Party newspaper has educated us, and we love the Party newspaper even more. It has stimulated our patriotic enthusiasm. In order to defend our homes and our motherland, all teachers and students of the school have been involved in the great volunteer patriotic action to resist America and aid Korea. For example, when applying to join the military cadre school, Yu Jingkun, a student in the first-year electrical manufacturing department, applied before the work had even started. The comrade in charge of the Communist Youth League branch told her, "Because you are still young, can you apply to participate? The leadership needs to consider this." She misunderstood that the general branch did not believe in her determination, so she pricked her finger and wrote a letter of determination in blood. When people asked her how she made this determination, she cried and couldn't speak, only sobbing and saying, "I hate the American devils, I love my motherland." In the evening, she wrote a note to her classmates, which read: "This matter is very simple. In the two years since liberation, the League has educated me. Especially in the months after I came to the industrial school, I have learned current affairs and politics by reading the newspaper every day. This has taught me about love and hate. I love our great motherland and the hardworking and brave Chinese people who have five thousand years of glorious history. I hate the bloody rule of the reactionaries and the decadent and depraved and inhumane aggression of imperialism. For our better future, I made this determination. Is it still strange?" And Yu Jingkun is just one of countless examples. The newspaper reading group has played a significant role in improving everyone's thinking and political understanding. We have not only accepted the teachings of the people's newspaper in our minds, but also turned it into practical action.

### 报纸使我们懂得了爱和憎

　　报纸使我们懂得了爱和憎
    国立北京重工业学校  刘瑞华
    我们北京重工业学校全校八百余师、生、员工，共成立了八十个读报小组。学校行政上以及生活指导科的同志们都很关心同学们的报纸学习，规定每天有一小时作为报纸学习时间。并有专人负责用红蓝笔圈划当日报纸学习的重点。各组便按照公布的重点来进行漫谈和阅读。
    在开始读报时，有些同学对读报组缺乏正确的了解，因之不大感兴趣。只是人家都在读报，自己不好意思不参加读报组。甚至有的人在读报时打瞌睡。由于大家学习报纸的热情不高，没有养成阅读报纸的习惯，其收获是不大的。为了激发大家的学习，学校行政上举行了首次时事测验，测验结果有半数的学员不及格。甚至有的人把尼赫鲁答成了英国人。因此，都感到对时事太不注意了。各班的团分支和学习班长便领导同学讨论了如何重视读报，搞好时事学习。许多班组织了时事小组，领导本班同学阅读报纸，帮助同学解决报纸学习方面的困难，并经常征求大家的意见，来改进学习方法。时事小组根据报纸杂志每隔半月或一月，把国内外的重大政治事件有系统的有分析的综合起来，以辅助同学们学习。有的时事小组更创造了时事游戏。如机械科四年级把他们平时搜集起来的一些时事问题，分别的写在小纸条上；在做游戏当中，谁输了，就请谁抓一个问题给大伙作解答。这样，大家不但高兴的做了游戏，还复习了时事。有时还利用课余时间开漫谈会。读报前把当天的重要报导，在黑板上写出简单的提纲，必要时还画上简明地图。除集体读报外，同学们还以“自学为主”的精神，利用空隙时间，来精读报上的社论和通讯。
    读报组成立迄今，一年来大家养成了很好的读报习惯，提高了同学们的政治水平。深深感到了我们伟大祖国的可爱。最重要的是认清了帝国主义及其走狗卑鄙无耻的残酷暴行。特别是自抗美援朝，保家卫国运动开展以来，同学更体念到时事学习的重要，都感觉一天不看报，就好像缺乏了什么重要东西似的。的确，党报教育了我们，我们也愈加热爱党报，它激发了我们的爱国热情，为了保卫我们的家乡，为了保卫我们的祖国，全校师生都卷入了伟大的抗美援朝的志愿爱国的行动中。如在申请报名参加军事干部学校时，一年级电机制造科的俞静坤同学，在这个工作尚未开始，她就要求报名。团总支负责同志对她说：“因你年龄尚小，能否报名参加？需要领导上考虑。”她误会总支是不相信她的决心，于是刺破手指写了决心血书。当人们问她怎样下的这个决心时，她哭得说不出话来，只是哽咽着说：“我恨死美国鬼子了，我爱自己的祖国。”傍晚，她又给同学们写了一个纸条，纸条上写着：“这事情很简单，在解放后两年来，团教育了我。尤其到工业学校以后的几个月中，每天读报学习时事政治、这使我懂得了爱与憎。我热爱我们具有五千年光荣历史的伟大祖国和勤劳勇敢的中国人民。我憎恨反动派的血腥统治和帝国主义腐朽堕落及其残无人道的侵略。为了我们更美好的未来，我下这样的决心。还奇怪吗？”而俞静坤只是无数事例中的一个。读报组对大家的思想和政治认识的提高起了很大的作用，我们不但在思想上接受了人民报纸的教导，而且还把它变成实际行动。
