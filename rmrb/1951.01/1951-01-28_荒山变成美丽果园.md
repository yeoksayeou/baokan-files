To the Editor:

　　Banggou Village in the First District of Qinyuan, Shanxi, is a remote little village. Behind this village, on the barren hills, lies a beautiful orchard with 800 pear trees of various sizes, 20 peach trees, 110 hawthorn trees, over a dozen damson plum trees, and over 100 walnut trees.

　　This is the achievement of Li Tianbao, a local poor peasant (who has risen to the level of middle peasant after the land reform). Li Tianbao is a farmer living at the foot of the mountain, and he has loved trees, especially fruit trees, since he was a child. He is now forty-seven years old, and he began learning how to graft trees more than twenty years ago. The orchard he planted with his own hands was once completely destroyed by the Japanese devils, but he did not lose heart. After the liberation of Shanxi, his orchard gradually became lush again.

　　Opening up an orchard on barren hills is not all; there are also many fruit trees created by him in this orchard. There are American pears grafted onto local tree trunks, with one pear weighing thirteen taels. There are foreign peaches on local tree trunks, with one peach weighing over a pound. Hawthorns can also grow on barren hills, and various large pears grow on small sugar pear trees.

　　Li Tianbao's labor has now influenced his neighbors. He has already helped his neighbors graft more than 1,400 fruit trees, and is systematically teaching five or six apprentices. At the Qinyuan County Labor Model Conference, representatives from more than a dozen villages requested that he go and impart his knowledge and help plant fruit trees.

　　荒山变成美丽果园
    编辑同志：
    山西沁源第一区半沟村，这是一个偏僻的小村子。在这村后的荒山上，有一片美丽的果园，其中有大小梨树八百株，桃树二十株，红果（山楂）树一百一十株，大黄李十余株，核桃树一百余株。
    这是当地一个贫农（土地改革后已上升为中农）李天保的劳动成绩。李天保是住在山脚下的一个农民，从小就喜爱树木，特别是喜爱果树。现在他已经四十七岁了，二十多年前就开始学会了接树。他亲手种下的果园，曾经被日本鬼子砍了个精光，但是他不灰心，山西解放后，他的果园又渐渐丰茂起来了。
    荒山上开辟了果园还不算，在这个果园中还有很多由他创造出来的果木树。这里有本地树本上接长的美国梨，一个梨有十三两重。有本地树本上的洋桃，一个桃也超过了一磅。山公棋上也能结红果，小糖梨树上结了各种大梨。
    李天保的劳动，现在已影响了附近的邻人。他已经帮助邻人们接种了一千四百多棵果木树，并且有计划地教授着五、六个徒弟。在沁源县劳动模范会上，有十几个村的代表要求他去传授与帮助种植果木树。
