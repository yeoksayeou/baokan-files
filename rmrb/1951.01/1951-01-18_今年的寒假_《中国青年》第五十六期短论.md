　　This Year's Winter Vacation
　　*China Youth* Issue 56 Short Essay

　　The year 1951 has begun, and the winter vacation is approaching again. During this year's winter vacation, continuing to carry out anti-American and patriotic propaganda and education is the responsibility of students in schools across the country.

　　The focus of anti-American and patriotic propaganda and education is to thoroughly eliminate pro-American, worship-America, and fear-America sentiments, promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, and promote patriotism and internationalism. In the anti-American and patriotic propaganda and education, we must use the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people over the past year, especially the fact that the Chinese People's Volunteers have achieved great victories in the war to aid the Korean people's liberation, to illustrate that our country has become the most important political and military power; and to explain that the imperialist bloc has suffered a worldwide defeat, and that imperialism has thus exposed its fundamental weaknesses, and that internal rifts have further widened. This will enable people to more deeply realize that imperialism is a paper tiger, and that the imperialist war of aggression plan will only continue to be defeated until it is completely shattered.

　　To carry out anti-American and patriotic propaganda and education, we should use various forms such as lectures and seminars, and the basic points should be explained clearly and in detail. Where possible, students can conduct propaganda in the countryside, and in the new areas, it must be combined with propaganda for land reform.

　　In addition, during the winter vacation, students can carry out some necessary social service activities (for example, urban students can participate in the work of factory spare-time schools, and rural students can assist in running winter schools), and can carry out necessary homework tutoring and student work cadre training and other activities according to actual needs.

　　In short, for student work during the winter vacation, various localities can determine different activity methods and focuses according to different working conditions. Because the specific situations in each locality are different, it is impossible to formulate a completely unified winter vacation work policy this year.

　　今年的寒假
    《中国青年》第五十六期短论
    一九五一年已经开始，寒假又将到来。在今年寒假期间，继续开展抗美爱国宣传教育是各地学校学生的责任。
    抗美爱国宣传教育的重点，就是彻底肃清亲美、崇美、恐美情绪，提倡民族自尊心与自信心，发扬爱国主义与国际主义精神。在抗美爱国的宣传教育中，我们要以中国人民一年来的辉煌成就，特别是以中国人民志愿军在援助朝鲜人民解放战争中取得伟大胜利的事实，来说明我国已成为最重要的政治、军事的强国；并说明帝国主义集团已经遭到世界性的失败，帝国主义由此更加暴露其根本弱点，由此内部裂痕更加扩大。这就能够使人们更深刻地认识到：帝国主义是纸老虎，帝国主义的侵略战争计划，只有继续受到失败，一直到完全破灭。
    进行抗美爱国的宣传教育，要利用讲演、座谈等各种形式，对于基本要点应该不厌求详地讲得清清楚楚。在可能的条件下，学生们可进行下乡宣传，在新区还须结合土地改革的宣传。
    此外在寒假期间，学生们可进行一些必要的社会服务活动（譬如城市学生可以参加工厂业余学校的工作，农村学生可以协助办好冬学），并可以根据实际需要，进行必要的功课补习以及学生工作干部训练等活动。
    总之，寒假期间的学生工作，各地可以根据不同的工作条件，确定不同的活动方式和重点。因为各地的具体情况不同，今年要制定完全统一的寒假工作方针是不可能的。
