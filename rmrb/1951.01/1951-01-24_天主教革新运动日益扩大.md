　　The Catholic Reformation Movement Is Expanding
    Guangzhou
    The Guangzhou Catholic Church convened a city-wide Catholic representatives meeting on the 20th, at which the Guangzhou Catholic Promotion of Self-Reliance and Reformation Temporary Working Committee was established. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including Chen Yixin, the Vicar General of the Guangzhou Catholic Diocese. At the meeting, Vicar General Chen Yixin said that in the past, Catholicism had been used by imperialism as a tool to invade China. Now that the Chinese people have turned over a new leaf, Catholics should give play to the spirit of patriotism, overcome difficulties, strive for self-reliance, and sever ties with imperialism. The meeting adopted the Guangzhou Catholic Church's declaration in response to the anti-American, patriotic, self-reliant, and reformation campaign, and established the Guangzhou Catholic Church Promotion of Self-Reliance and Reformation Temporary Working Committee, electing Chen Yixin, the Vicar General of the Guangzhou Diocese, priests Lian Mingde, Tan Ganchao, Ye Xiang, Liu Qianchang, Huang Mingchao, Chen Zhixiong, the principal of Mingde Girls' High School, Chen Miaoling, the director of Peter's Hospital, and twenty-seven others as members.

Father Kong Lingzhong pointed out that the cases of Chinese and foreign reactionaries using the church to carry out counter-revolutionary activities uncovered in Shijiazhuang, Xianxian, Qiqihar, and other places are powerful proof. The meeting unanimously decided to issue a declaration in response to the Catholic self-reliance reformation movement in various places. The declaration stated in brief: We, the Catholics in Kunming, enthusiastically respond to the patriotic movement of Catholics across the country, implement autonomy, self-sufficiency, and self-propagation. Thoroughly break off relations with imperialism, rely on our own efforts, and achieve the goal of having Chinese priests preach on their own.

The declaration stated: Catholics in Hangzhou City and Zhejiang Province! Now is the time for us to act. We resolutely respond to the self-reliance reformation movement of Catholics across the country, eliminate the influence of imperialism, establish the viewpoint of hating America, despising America, and scorning America, and support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

On January 6th, Catholics throughout the city held a demonstration against cultural aggression by American imperialism and also organized a current affairs study committee. He called on Catholics throughout the city to draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, adhere to the doctrines of loving the motherland and loving peace, resolutely sever the relationship between religion and the utilization by American imperialism, and strive to carry out the "autonomy, self-sufficiency, and self-propagation" reformation movement.
