The All-China Railway Workers' Union Voices Support for Japanese Worker Brothers

[By our reporter] Li Jiebo, Chairman of the All-China Railway Workers' Union, issued a statement regarding the "Matsukawa Incident" in which American and Japanese fascists framed Japanese Communist Party members and Japanese workers. He also sent a telegram to the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union to express sympathy and support for Japanese worker brothers, and sent a telegram to the Fukushima Court protesting the reactionary verdict and demanding the immediate release of the arrested Japanese Communist Party members and workers.

Li Jiebo's Statement on the "Matsukawa Incident"

In his statement, Li Jiebo stated: The so-called "Matsukawa Incident" manufactured by the reactionary Japanese government under the instigation of American imperialism is a planned and frenzied attack on the Japanese people, especially the Japanese working class. This crazy suppression of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese working class by American and Japanese fascists is aimed at destroying the Japanese people's peace and democracy movement, so as to arm Japanese fascists, foster the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces, and turn Japan into a colony of American imperialism and a military base for aggression against China and Asia. This is a challenge from the American and Japanese reactionaries to the Japanese working class, and also a challenge to the Chinese working class, the Asian working class, and the working class of the whole world. Chinese railway workers express the greatest concern and respect for the struggle waged by Japanese railway worker brothers, and express the greatest sympathy and support for the persecution they have suffered.

In his statement, Li Jiebo called on all railway employees to carry forward the spirit of high internationalism and use active actions to support the struggle of Japanese worker brothers.

Telegram of Support to the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union

Li Jiebo sent a telegram to the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union, stating:

Suzuki Shin, chairman of the Fukushima branch of your railway workers' union, and twenty other Japanese Communist Party members and patriotic workers, were illegally sentenced to death and imprisonment by the reactionary Japanese government under the pretext of the "Matsukawa Train Derailment Incident." Upon hearing this, our national railway workers expressed extreme indignation at this extremely reactionary measure. Chinese railway workers have always expressed deep concern and sympathy for your just struggle for Japan's independence, peace, and democracy. In addition to expressing a serious protest to the reactionary Japanese government, we pledge to fully support you and serve as your backing. We firmly believe that the working class, the laboring people, and friends who love peace and democracy all over the world will also support you. We hope that you will persist in your struggle, and final victory will surely belong to you and the Japanese working class.

Telegram of Protest to the Fukushima Court of Japan

Li Jiebo sent a telegram of protest to the Fukushima Court of Japan, stating:

We are very indignant to hear that it was under your hand that the death and imprisonment of Suzuki Shin, chairman of the Fukushima branch of the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union, and twenty other Japanese patriotic workers arrested in the "Matsukawa Incident" were sentenced. On behalf of the Chinese railway workers, I lodge a serious protest against your illegal verdict and demand their immediate release; otherwise, you will bear all the consequences of this incident. Chinese railway workers will never sit idly by and watch your persecution of the Japanese working class.

　　中国铁路工会全国委员会声援日本工人兄弟
    【本报讯】中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯，为美日法西斯诬害日共党员和日本工人的“松川事件”发表谈话，并致电日本国营铁路工会转日本全国铁路工人，表示同情和声援日本工人兄弟；致电日本福岛裁判所抗议反动的判决，要求立即释放被捕的日共党员和工人。
    李颉伯为“松川事件”发表谈话
    李颉伯在谈话中称：日本反动政府在美帝国主义授意下制造的所谓“松川事件”，是有计划的向日本人民特别是日本工人阶级的疯狂进攻。美日法西斯对日本共产党和日本工人阶级这种疯狂的镇压，是为了摧残日本人民的和平民主运动，以便武装日本法西斯，扶植日本侵略势力再起，把日本变为美帝国主义的殖民地与侵略中国和亚洲的军事基地。这是美日反动派向日本工人阶级的挑战，也是向中国工人阶级、亚洲工人阶级和全世界工人阶级的挑战。中国铁路工人对于日本铁路工人兄弟所进行的斗争表示最大的关怀和敬意，对他们所遭受的迫害表示最大的同情与声援。
    李颉伯在谈话中号召全国铁路职工应发扬高度的国际主义精神，用积极行动来声援支持日本工人兄弟的斗争。
    致日本国营铁路工会支援电
    李颉伯致日本国营铁路工会电称：
    贵国铁路工会福岛分会委员长铃木信等二十位日本共产党员与爱国工人，被日本反动政府借口“松川列车颠覆事件”而非法判决死刑及徒刑，我们全国铁路工人闻悉之后，对此极端反动的措施，表示异常愤慨。中国铁路工人一向对于你们为争取日本的独立、和平、民主而进行的正义斗争表示深切的关怀与同情，除向日本反动政府表示严重抗议外，并誓以全力支援你们，作为你们的后盾。我们深信全世界工人阶级、劳动人民以及爱好和平民主的朋友们，也必将支援你们，希望你们坚持斗争，最后胜利一定是属于你们和日本工人阶级的。
    致日本福岛裁判所抗议电
    李颉伯致日本福岛裁判所抗议电称：
    我们非常愤慨的听到是在你们手下，判决了“松川事件”被捕者日本国营铁路工会福岛分会委员长铃木信等二十位日本爱国工人的死刑及徒刑，我代表中国铁路工人对你们的非法判决，提出严重的抗议，并要求立即释放他们，否则你们将负这一事件的一切后果，中国铁路工人决不能坐视你们对日本工人阶级的迫害。
