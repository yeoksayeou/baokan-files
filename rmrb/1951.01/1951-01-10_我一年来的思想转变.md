My Ideological Transformation Over the Past Year
　　Zhang Wanxing, Driver, Wuhan Locomotive Depot, Delegate to the National Model Worker Representative Conference
　　Editor's Note: Comrade Zhang Wanxing’s letter is very good. This letter reflects the important changes in the thinking of the Chinese working class and is very valuable. In order to more broadly reflect the ideological transformation of workers, workers from all regions are welcome to actively express their opinions.
　　In the year or so since liberation, I have been constantly improving. This is the result of the Party's cultivation, everyone's help, and the education of real life. Looking back to when we were first liberated, I still had a lot of backward ideas. Soon after liberation, the depot was going to implement a contracted driver system, preparing to eliminate the workers who specialized in cleaning the locomotives and have us do it ourselves. At the time, I didn't think it was appropriate. The workers all said, "We've been driving trains for so many years, and we've never seen anything like this before." I told this to the leading cadres, but he encouraged me, saying, "Your locomotive is a 'Forward' model, you should take the lead; you shouldn't be afraid of difficulties." I thought this was right, so I went back and discussed it with everyone, but they disagreed, so I was the first to start cleaning the train. Others scolded me, saying, "Driving and cleaning, just showing off." I ignored them and kept cleaning. Later, everyone slowly started cleaning as well. This first time gave me a good lesson: difficulties can be overcome.
　　Later, when running the train to Xianning to take on water, I got my hands covered in grease while inspecting the locomotive. Coincidentally, Deputy Director Zhang was also inspecting in Xianning. He saw me and ran over to shake my hand, and warmly asked me, "Have you eaten?" He also said, "The weather is too hot! You're working hard." He said a lot of comforting words. This moved me greatly. Under the Kuomintang rule, what about the director? We would salute him, and he wouldn't even acknowledge us. Today, the people's director is not only unafraid of grease and shakes hands with us roughnecks, but also, during the trial run of the locomotive, the director and department heads all consulted with us. The workers being masters of their own affairs—this is not just empty talk.
　　When the Second Field Army marched south, the soldiers came to the locomotive to shake hands and talk with us, asking about our well-being, and explaining to us the principle of the working class leading the revolution. When getting off the train, the People's Liberation Army comrades also gave us cigarettes to smoke. I've been driving trains for decades and have never seen soldiers so kind and courteous. I said to myself, "If this isn't the people's army, what is?" At this point, I no longer had any doubts about the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army.
　　Last year, after studying at the Central China Workers' School, I further understood that the Communist Party is working for the happiness of the broad masses; I also understood that American imperialism has always been our mortal enemy. After returning from school, I worked even harder. Later, everyone elected me to go to Beijing to participate in the National Railway Workers' Representative Conference, where I learned a lot of experience from the locomotive banner, Li Yong. After returning, I selected targets and set plans with my fellow workers. The locomotive traveled 30,000 safe kilometers continuously. In September, I was selected to participate in the National Model Worker Representative Conference, and I was so happy that I felt like I was blooming.
　　During the National Model Worker Conference in Beijing, I heard the reports from the leading comrades and received a warm welcome from the people of all social strata. I thought to myself: if it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, a poor worker like me would never have been able to attend such a glorious conference in Beijing. When drinking water, one must not forget the well digger, so in addition to deeply thanking Chairman Mao, I resolutely responded to the over-axle movement initiated by Li Yong, guaranteeing more hauling and faster running, saving coal and oil, eliminating accidents, and thoroughly implementing the responsibility system, strengthening the power to resist America and aid Korea and defend our homes and country.

### 我一年来的思想转变

　　我一年来的思想转变
    出席全国劳模代表会议代表武昌机务段司机  张万兴
    编者按：张万兴同志的来信是很好的，这封信反映了中国工人阶级的思想的重要变化，是很宝贵的。为了更广泛地反映工人的思想转变，欢迎各地工人踊跃发表意见。
    解放后这一年多，我不断得到进步。这都是党的培养、大家帮助和现实生活教育的结果。回想刚解放时，我还是一股落后劲。解放不久，段上要实行包乘制，准备把专门擦车的工友取消，由我们自己来擦。我当时就认为不合适。工友们也都说：“开多少年车，从来就没见过这回事。”我把这话告诉领导干部，他却鼓励我说：“你们机车是个‘前进号’，应该起带头作用；不应该怕困难。”我觉得这话不错，便又回去和大伙商量，大家不同意，我就头一个动手擦车。别人骂我说：“开车又去擦车，尽出风头。”我不理，一个劲擦下去。后来慢慢地大家也擦起来了。这头一回给我很好的教育：困难是可以克服的。
    以后跑车到咸宁上水，我在检查机车时弄得满手油泥，凑巧张副局长也巡视到咸宁，看见了便跑过来和我握手，还亲热地问我“吃饭了没有？”又说“天气太热啦！你们辛苦了。”说了许多安慰的话。这叫我感动得不得了。国民党统治时，局长么？我们向他敬礼他还不理。今天人民的局长不但不怕油泥跟我们大老粗握手，而且在试运牵引时，局长处长都找我们商量。工人当家作主这才不叫空话。
    二野大军南下时，战士们到机车上来和我们握手谈话，问寒问暖，向我们解释工人阶级领导革命的道理。下车时解放军同志还送香烟给我们抽。我跑了几十年车就没有见过当兵的这样和气有礼貌。我对自己说：“这不是人民队伍是什么？”这时我对共产党解放军就不再存啥怀疑了。
    去年经过华中工人学校的学习，我进一步明白共产党是为广大群众谋幸福的；我也清楚了美帝国主义一贯是我们的死对头。从学校回来我工作得更带劲。后来大伙选我到北京参加全国铁路职工代表会，向机车旗帜李永学习了好多经验。回来后我就跟伙友们选目标、订计划。机车连续行走了三万安全公里。九月间我被选上参加全国劳模代表会议，心里乐得活像开了花。
    在北京开劳模大会时，听到了各位首长的报告，受到各阶层人民的热烈欢迎。我心想：如果不是共产党和毛主席的领导，像我这种穷工人，一辈子也不会到北京开这样光荣的会。饮水忘不掉掏井的人，因此除了深深地感谢毛主席外，我坚决响应李永发起的超轴运动，保证多拉快跑，节煤节油，消灭事故，彻底实行负责制。增强抗美援朝、保家卫国的力量。
