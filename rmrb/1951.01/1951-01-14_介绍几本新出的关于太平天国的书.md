Chinese historians have been paying attention to the study of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom for over twenty years. In these twenty years, they have discovered many valuable documents and written many books and research papers of varying lengths. Recently, in addition to individual articles, we have seen the following books: "A Draft History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" (by Luo Ergang, published by Kaiming Bookstore), "The Anti-Qing Movement in Guangxi Before and After the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" (by Xie Xingyao, published by Sanlian Bookstore), "Collection of Essays on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolutionary Movement" (edited by the History Research Office of North China University, published by Sanlian Bookstore), "A Collection of Essays on Discerning Falsehoods in Historical Materials of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" (by Luo Ergang, published by Commercial Press), and "Historical Materials of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" (edited by the Liberal Arts Research Institute of Peking University and the Beijing Library, published by Kaiming Bookstore). The first two are relatively systematic works, the third and fourth are related essays and textual research, and the fifth is a collection of historical materials. Chinese historians are contributing such relatively rich research results to the centenary of the outbreak of this great revolutionary movement.

(1) "A Draft History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Luo Ergang wrote "An Outline History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Although it was a relatively substantial work, it also had many shortcomings. Not only was the material insufficient, but certain viewpoints (such as praising the Han traitors Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang, and emphasizing overpopulation as the cause of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution) also needed to be revised. The newly published "A Draft History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" largely remedies the shortcomings of the previous book, especially in the collection of materials, which is much richer. This book is written in the style of past official histories, divided into twenty-seven volumes: two volumes of annals, four tables, nine treatises, and twelve biographies. The biographies contain relatively substantial introductions to the revolutionary leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The tables contain fairly detailed records of the Nian Army's resistance against the Qing Dynasty and the uprising of secret societies. The treatises systematically describe religion, society, the heavenly calendar, military affairs, officials, rites, criminal law, and the imperial examination system. This is currently a relatively complete work on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

(2) "The Anti-Qing Movement in Guangxi Before and After the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Mr. Xie Xingyao previously wrote some essays on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. He himself honestly said that "seventy to eighty percent of these are incorrect." He also said: "Now we have new views on the revolutionary movement initiated by Hong and Yang, and we can say that we have gained a deeper understanding." This book was written under these circumstances. This book uses concrete materials to introduce the social situation and class relations in Guangxi at the time of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising, allowing us to more clearly understand the causes of the uprising. The book devotes its main focus to narrating the actions of the revolutionary masses during the two years from the Jintian Uprising to their departure from Guangxi and entry into Hunan. This narrative provides many valuable materials for those studying the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

(3) "Collection of Essays on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolutionary Movement." This book contains nine essays and textual researches, providing relatively detailed introductions and analyses of the armed organization, foreign policy, commercial policy of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, as well as the Nian Army and Du Wenxiu's army, which were closely related to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement. Most of these articles are valuable, but some contain individual errors. For example, in the article "The Commercial Policy of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," the author excessively emphasizes the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's free foreign trade, praising their attitude of "foreign merchants are like brothers" towards foreign capitalist merchants, and praising their permission for foreign capitalist merchants to "freely enter and exit our territory." This is incorrect. The result of implementing this policy was simply to undermine the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's protectionist trade policy.

(4) "A Collection of Essays on Discerning Falsehoods in Historical Materials of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Over the past twenty years, Mr. Luo has written many essays on the historical events of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and textual research on discerning falsehoods in historical materials. Mr. Luo's work in this area is very meaningful because the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was established for a very short time. Not only did the revolutionaries have no opportunity to write a complete written history for themselves, but they also had no opportunity to systematically preserve their valuable historical materials. The enemy of the Heavenly Kingdom, the Qing government and the Han traitor Zeng Guofan, made many distortions of the history of the Heavenly Kingdom, and later some people forged many historical materials from different perspectives. This presents a difficult problem for those studying the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. In order to answer this difficult problem, Mr. Luo's efforts are commendable. This book is divided into two parts: the first part is on discerning falsehoods in historical events, and the second part is on discerning falsehoods in historical materials. The articles collected in both parts are substantial.

(5) "Historical Materials of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." This book is divided into four parts: the first part is official books of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the second part is documents of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (divided into edicts, general documents, documents of the Heaven and Earth Society, etc.), the third part is documents of the Qing Dynasty, and the fourth part is Chinese and foreign records. These materials are all very valuable and provide great convenience for those studying the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. We hope that more historical material collections, such as the second and third collections, will continue to appear in the future.

From the above collections of works, textual research, and historical materials, we can see a gratifying phenomenon, that is, both new and old historians are striving to use the scientific method of historical materialism to study Chinese historical problems. Although there are still inevitable shortcomings and errors in everyone's research, this phenomenon of pursuing truth and obeying truth is commendable. Under the guidance of the advanced theory of historical materialism, through everyone's efforts, we will soon see an accurate and rich work describing this glorious history appear in the historical circles of New China.

　　介绍几本新出的关于太平天国的书
    史学进
    中国的历史学者注意研究太平天国的问题已经有二十余年了。二十余年中，他们发现了不少的宝贵文献，写作了不少的大小册子与研究文字。在最近期间，除单篇文字外，我们已看到下面几种成本的著作：“太平天国史稿”（罗尔纲著、开明书店出版），“太平天国前后广西的反清运动”（谢兴尧著、三联书店出版），“太平天国革命运动论文集”（华北大学历史研究室编、三联书店出版），“太平天国史料辨伪集”（罗尔纲著、商务印书馆出版），“太平天国史料”（北京大学文科研究所、北京图书馆编辑，开明书店出版）。前两种是比较有系统的著作，第三、四种是有关的论文及考证文字，第五种是史料的收辑。中国的历史学者，就以这样比较丰富的研究成果贡献这个伟大的革命运动发轫的百年纪念。
    （一）“太平天国史稿”。抗战以前，罗尔纲先生写过一本“太平天国史纲”，虽然还算是一本比较有分量的著作，不过缺点也很多，不只材料不够充分，而且在某些观点上（如对于汉奸曾国藩、李鸿章的称赞，强调人口过剩是太平天国革命的原因等）也需要修正。新出的这本“太平天国史稿”，大体补救了上一本书的缺点，特别在材料的搜集上是丰富得多了。这本书是按照过去正史的纪传体写的，全书共分二十七卷：计本纪二，表四，志九，列传十二。列传中对于太平天国的革命领袖都有比较充实的介绍，表中对于捻军抗清与会党起义有相当详尽的记载，志中对于宗教、社会、天历、兵、百官、礼、刑法、科举也作了有系统的叙述。这是目前比较完整的关于太平天国的著作。
    （二）“太平天国前后广西的反清运动”。谢兴尧先生从前写过一些有关太平天国的论文，这些论文，他自己很诚恳地说是“十之七八都不正确”。他并且说：“现在对于洪杨所倡导的革命运动，已有了新的观点，也可以说得到了进一步的认识。”他这本书，便是在这种情况之下写成的。这本书用具体材料介绍了太平天国起义时广西的社会情况与阶级关系，使我们比较明确的认识了起义的原因。书中用主要的篇幅叙述革命群众从金田起义到离桂入湘二年中间的行动，这一段历史的叙述，给研究太平天国史的人提供了许多有价值的资料。
    （三）“太平天国革命运动论文集”。这本书包含九篇论文与考证，对于太平天国的武装组织、外交政策、商业政策以及与太平天国运动有密切关系的捻军、杜文秀军，都有比较详细的介绍与分析。这些文章，大都是有价值的，但其中也有个别的错误。如在“太平天国的商业政策”一文中，过分强调太平天国对外贸易的自由，称颂他们对外国资本主义的商人的“外国商人，一如兄弟”的态度，称颂他们允许外国资本主义的商人“均可随意出入我境内”的态度，这是不对的。这种政策执行的结果，只是破坏太平天国的保护贸易的政策。
    （四）“太平天国史料辨伪集”。二十年来，罗先生写了不少关于太平天国的史事与史料辨伪的考证文章。罗先生从事这件工作是很有意义的，因为太平天国建国很短，革命的人们不只没有可能为他们自己写下一部完整的文字的历史，而且也没有可能有计划的保存下他们的宝贵史料。天国的敌人满清政府及汉奸曾国藩曾对天国的历史进行了许多曲解，其后又有些人从不同的角度上伪造了许多史料。这就给研究太平天国史的人一个难题。为了解答这个难题，罗先生的努力是值得称赞的。这本书分两辑：第一辑是史事辨伪，第二辑是史料辨伪，两辑中所收的文章都很充实。
    （五）“太平天国史料”。这本书共分四个部分，第一部分是太平天国官书，第二部分是太平天国文书（内分诏旨、一般文书、天地会文书等），第三部分是清方文书，第四部分是中外纪载。这些材料，都是很宝贵的，给了研究太平天国史的人很大的方便。我们希望将来更有史料第二辑、三辑继续出现。
    从以上的著作、考证及史料的收集中看出一个可喜的现象，那就是新旧史学家都在努力用历史唯物论这个科学的方法来研究中国的历史问题。尽管在大家的研究中还不免有缺点和错误，但是这种追求真理、服从真理的现象是值得称颂的。在历史唯物论的先进理论指导之下，经过大家的奋勉努力，在不久的将来，我们将会看到一本正确而丰富的叙述这一段光辉历史的著作出现在新中国的史学界中。
