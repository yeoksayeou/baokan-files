Xinhua News Agency, January 20th - People in various places have expressed praise and gratitude for the Soviet Union's selfless spirit and great act of friendship in unconditionally transferring to our country the property it managed or leased in Northeast China.

　　Shanghai's Wenhui Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and Xinmin Evening News all published commentaries. Wenhui Daily's commentary stated: This matter fully demonstrates the Soviet government's respect for the rights of the Chinese people, proves the greatness of the Soviet Union's foreign policy principles, and more specifically proves that the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people are becoming increasingly close and consolidated. Local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Shanghai have also issued statements thanking the Soviet Union. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated in its statement: This once again proves that the Soviet Union is indeed our country's most sincere friend, and only on the Soviet side can we find true friendship and assistance.

　　Deng Guiyong, a model worker at the Nanjing Radio Factory, said: "The Soviet Union treats us with equality and mutual benefit, while American imperialism uses airplanes and cannons to invade us. We workers have clearly recognized who is the enemy and who is the friend."

　　People in Hubei Province and the cities of Xi'an, Chongqing, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and others have also expressed their praise and gratitude to the Soviet Union. Local organizations of various democratic parties in Hubei Province said in a jointly published written opinion: This is another manifestation of the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. This noble friendship has increased our confidence in building a new China and preventing American imperialist aggression. Zhang Guiling, Zhang Yan, and other young students in Xi'an who were admitted to the People's Aviation School said: Facts have proven that the Soviet Union is a true friend of the Chinese people, while the American imperialists, who claim to be "friendly" to the Chinese people, are truly our mortal enemies. Huang Tianxi, director of the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Federation, said: "The great friendship of the Soviet Union in fairly transferring property to us is in sharp contrast to the crime of the United States invading our Taiwan."

　　上海南京湖北等地人民感激苏联移交财产
    【新华社二十日讯】各地人民对苏联将东北代管或租用的财产无偿地移交我国的大公无私精神和伟大的友谊行动，纷纷表示赞扬和感激。
    上海文汇报、大公报、新闻日报均发表评论。文汇报的评论说：这件事，充分证明了苏联政府对中国人民权利的尊重，证明苏联外交政策原则的伟大，更具体证明了中苏两国人民友谊和合作日趋亲密和巩固了。上海各民主党派地方组织和人民团体也都纷纷发表感谢苏联的声明。中国国民党革命委员会上海市分部筹备委员会的声明中说：这又一次证明了苏联确实是我国最真挚的友人，只有在苏联这一方面，我们才能找到真正的友谊和援助。
    南京市劳动模范、有线电厂工人邓桂永说：“苏联以平等互惠对待我们，而美帝国主义却用飞机和大炮来侵略我们，我们工人已清楚地认清了谁是敌人，谁是朋友。”
    湖北省及西安、重庆、福州、厦门等市的人民也都纷纷表示对苏联的赞扬和感谢。湖北省各民主党派的地方组织在联合发表的书面意见中说：这是中苏伟大友谊的又一表现。这种崇高的友谊，增加了我们建设新中国和制止美帝国主义侵略的信心。西安市考入人民航空学校的青年学生张贵龄、张燕等表示：事实证明了苏联是中国人民真实的友人，而自称与中国人民“友好”的美帝国主义者真正是我们的死敌。厦门市归国华侨联谊会主任黄天锡说：“苏联公正地移交财产给我们的伟大友谊，与美国侵略我国台湾的罪行恰成鲜明的对照。”
