　　Moldy Public Grain in Lu'an Prefecture, Northern Anhui: Relevant Authorities Should Quickly Inspect and Handle

Editor Comrade:

　　Tens of thousands of catties of public grain in Lu'an Prefecture, Northern Anhui, and Quanjiao County have experienced serious phenomena such as mold, heat, and water adulteration, which urgently requires attention and prompt handling by the leading authorities.

　　The task of collecting production and disaster relief grain in this area is relatively urgent, and most of the lower-level cadres are newly employed or transferred from other places, lacking experience in collecting and storing public grain (some cadres have a mercenary attitude and simply aim to complete the task). Therefore, they are sloppy in receiving public grain and do not examine grain of poor quality. According to a recent inspection by the Huai River Management Headquarters, 300,000 catties of brown rice received by the Zhengyangguan Grain Station in November were found to be heating up, and 300,000 catties of cooked rice had partially deteriorated; the public grain received by the Shou County Chengguan Station from Caomiao District contained 3% to 7% sand; 240,000 catties of brown rice received by Dadiangang from Lu'an County contained water, with 15,000 catties deteriorated and smelling of distiller's grains. Given the serious situation described above, coupled with the poor conditions of the warehouses on the levees, failure to promptly inspect will inevitably lead to large-scale mold, causing difficulties in the supply for the Huai River project.

　　In Quanjiao County, due to the recent busy grain collection and transportation work, cadres have relaxed timely inspections of old grain, resulting in large-scale heating and mold in the county's grain reserves in various districts. For example, about 8,000 catties of rice stored in the Yuhe Village warehouse in Gushan District are moldy; about 2,000 catties of rice stored in the Yangcang warehouse in Erhuchong are also moldy; and about 2,000 catties of rice stored in the Yuwei warehouse are moldy. Furthermore, the Dawang warehouse in Taiping District, originally a dilapidated ancestral hall, stores grain entrusted to nearby people for safekeeping. The warehouse负责人 lack of inspection has led to over 3,000 catties of sprouted and moldy rice. The Dayang warehouse (also an ancestral hall) has also discovered 5,000 catties of sprouted and moldy rice, and the courtyard of the warehouse is full of grain, which no one sweeps up, allowing birds and rodents to peck and eat it, resulting in significant losses.

　　The series of moldy grain situations mentioned above demonstrates that some comrades' understanding of protecting public grain is still insufficient; they are only busy with collection and transfer, while neglecting storage and inspection. We suggest that in addition to the leading authorities promptly handling the bad grain, those derelict in their duties should also be strictly investigated and appropriately punished.

### 皖北六安专区霉烂公粮  有关机关应迅速检查处理

　　皖北六安专区霉烂公粮
    有关机关应迅速检查处理编辑同志：
    皖北六安专区及全椒县之公粮数十万斤发生霉烂、霉热、羼水等严重现象，急应引起领导机关重视与迅速处理。
    该区征收生产救灾粮任务较紧急，下级干部又大多数是新参加工作和从外地调来的，缺乏征收和保管公粮经验（部分干部存在雇佣和单纯完成任务的观点），因此在接收公粮中马虎了事，对成色不好的公粮也不加审查。据最近治淮指挥部检查，发现正阳关粮站十一月间所接收之糙米，有三十万斤正在发热，熟米三十万斤已部分变质；寿县城关站接收曹庙区的公粮中，渗有沙土百分之三至百分之七；大店岗接收六安县之糙米二十四万斤，其中有十四万斤羼水，一万五千斤变质有酒糟味。根据上述严重情况，加上堤上仓库条件较差，如不迅速检查，势必酿成大批霉烂，造成治淮工程供应的困难。
    全椒县由于近来征粮调运工作的繁忙，干部放松了陈粮的及时检查，因之该县各区存粮大批发热霉烂。如孤山区喻河村仓库存稻约霉八千余斤；二湖冲杨仓存稻约二千多斤亦发霉；喻圩仓库存稻霉烂约二千斤。又如太平区大王仓库，原系破旧祠堂，存粮系交附近群众保管，仓库负责人缺乏检查，致生芽霉烂者达三千多斤；大杨仓库（亦系祠堂）亦发现生芽及霉烂稻五千斤，且该库院落里粮食满地，无人打扫，任凭雀啄鼠食，损失很大。
    由以上一连串发生的霉烂粮食情况看来，证明有些同志思想上对保护公粮的认识还很不够；只忙于征调，而疏忽保管和检查。我们建议除领导机关对坏粮应抓紧处理外，对失职人员也要严格追查责任，予以适当处分。
