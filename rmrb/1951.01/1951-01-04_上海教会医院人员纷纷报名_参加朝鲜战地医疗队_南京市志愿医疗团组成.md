Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd: Personnel from six hospitals run by Christian churches in Shanghai, including Hongren, Renji, Tongren, Ximen Maternity and Children's Hospital, Health Sanatorium, and Bethel, jointly issued a declaration on December 27, protesting the insulting speech made by the American representative Austin at the Security Council on November 28. The medical personnel of these hospitals have also actively signed up to join the Korean War battlefield medical team as a practical action to express their determination to resist America and aid Korea. As of now, 24 people from Renji Hospital have volunteered to join the Korean War battlefield medical team, and 9 people from Hongren Hospital have signed up. Liu Qicheng, the director of the Health Sanatorium, and Wang Changhua, a surgeon, have also signed up. Zhang Jingmei, the head nurse of Hongren Hospital, who has worked in the hospital for more than 20 years, is not suitable for joining the battlefield medical team due to her age; but she said: "I guarantee to do my job well to support my colleagues who have signed up." In addition, the staff of the Health Sanatorium has launched a campaign to donate medicines.

All public and private hospitals have assisted and lent medical equipment, enabling each team to have modern war injury treatment equipment.

Cai Qiao, chairman of the Nanjing Medical and Health Community Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, said at the founding meeting of the medical team: This great volunteer action fully demonstrates the firm will of Nanjing medical workers to resist America and aid Korea.
