　　Please Taiyuan Railway Administration to inspect locomotive repair work.
    To the Editor:
    On December 24th of last year, I took the No. 8 Special Express train on the Beijing-Hankou Railway northward from Hankou. After the train passed Handan, it was switched to locomotive No. 1518 belonging to the Taiyuan Railway Bureau. The train's heating pipe was broken and could not provide heat. The temperature inside the train dropped sharply. Passengers were shivering with cold deep into the night; especially the children, who were crying from the cold. Passengers repeatedly requested heating from the train staff, but to no avail. According to our understanding from car inspectors Liu Zhenhua, Li Kangliang, and Gao Genzi: such incidents frequently occur with locomotives under the jurisdiction of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau. The driver, Hu Tinglu, also said: "There is nothing we can do if the steam pipe is broken. Only if the Taiyuan Railway Bureau repairs all the locomotives will we not be blamed by the passengers." I believe that passengers traveling from the south to the north will not have prepared sufficient clothing and bedding. The lack of heating in the train will greatly affect the health of passengers. Therefore, I suggest that the Ministry of Railways send someone to inspect the locomotive repair work of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, and request that the responsible comrades of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau earnestly manage the people's railway cause well.

　　请太原铁路管理局检查机车检修工作编辑同志：
    我于去年十二月二十四日，由汉口乘京汉路第八次特别快车北来。车过邯郸以后，换上太原铁路局的一五一八号机车。车上暖气管坏了，不能放入暖气。车内温度骤然降低。夜深时旅客都冷得浑身战栗；特别是小孩子们，都冻得哭了。乘客们纷纷向车上负责人提出要暖气的要求，但都没有结果。据我们从检车员刘振华、李康亮和高根子同志处了解：太原铁路局管内机车常有这种事发生。司机胡庭禄也说：“汽管坏了没办法。只有找太原路局把机车都修好了我们才不会受旅客的埋怨。”我认为由南方到北方来的火车，旅客的衣服被褥都不会准备得充足的。车内没有暖气，对旅客身体健康会有很大妨碍。因此，我建议铁道部派人检查太原铁路局的机车修理工作，并要求太原路局的负责同志能认真来办好人民铁道事业。
