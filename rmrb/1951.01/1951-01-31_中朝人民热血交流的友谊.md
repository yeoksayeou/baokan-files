　　The Friendship of the Chinese and Korean People Through the Exchange of Blood

    (I)

    This happened in a certain field hospital of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    Korean People's Army soldier Kim Chang-bo is currently receiving cordial and thorough treatment in this field hospital. He recounted his experience of receiving treatment at the field hospital of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    "It happened on a certain day on a certain front. My mission was to scout the enemy's forward positions. I calmly penetrated the enemy's formation. After I had scouted the enemy's situation in detail, on the way back to the team, I was subjected to a hail of gunfire from the enemy, and I was seriously wounded in the shoulder. I cheered myself up and tried to stand up several times, but I couldn't move my body at all, and finally I fainted."

    "Just at that moment, the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who were passing by found me and immediately sent me to the field hospital in the rear, which is where I am now receiving cordial care."

    "Chinese Doctor Zhang immediately performed emergency treatment, but due to excessive blood loss, I developed severe anemia and my life was in danger... Doctor Zhang immediately checked my blood type and found that it was the same as his. In order to save a Korean People's soldier, he did not hesitate to immediately draw a lot of blood from himself and personally transfuse it to me. Thanks to Doctor Zhang's blood transfusion rescue, I finally escaped from danger. ...I only heard about all this later..."

    "Doctor Zhang's noble spirit of sacrifice does not stop there. After the higher authorities learned about Doctor Zhang's action of sacrificing himself to rescue a soldier, they commended him with a bonus in order to take care of his health. However, Doctor Zhang bought chicken, eggs, etc. with the money he received..., and sent them to me to eat."

    "Under Doctor Zhang's enthusiastic and thorough care, I was not only rescued, but I will soon be able to return to the front."

    "...Whenever I thanked him, he only said: 'I only did what I should have done... We spare no effort in order to defeat the common enemy.' That's all he said."
            (Translated by Cui Bin from "Democratic Korea" on December 30)
  (II)
    The military doctors and nurses of a certain rear hospital of the Korean People's Army, led by Commander Lee Jung-woo (transliteration), are contributing all their enthusiasm and strength to treat and care for the wounded of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    One day, when the military doctors and nurses went to the front to treat the wounded, they encountered a Volunteer Army soldier who was seriously wounded. Because of excessive blood loss, his face was pale and he was in a coma.

    Blood transfusion! The military doctors and nurses immediately thought of this only and emergency measure.

    Not a minute to lose! The military doctors and nurses were determined to use every means to save this true man who fought for human justice.

    Quick, to the surgical room! The military doctors and nurses carried the soldier on a stretcher.

    No one said whose blood should be transfused, because everyone had already decided in their hearts to draw their own blood.

    When they arrived at the surgical room, the nurses were all preparing to draw their own blood. It was difficult for the military doctor to decide whose blood should be used. At this time, Nurse Choi Caiyu (transliteration) had already drawn her own blood and ran to the military doctor with a blood transfusion device, saying: "My blood type is the same as this Chinese comrade's, it's O type." She had already tested the soldier's blood type. The military doctor decided to transfuse Comrade Choi Caiyu's blood.

    One cc, two cc... Watching her own blood being transfused into the soldier's left wrist, Comrade Choi Caiyu, the military doctor, and the nurses once again deeply felt the solid friendship between the Korean and Chinese people, who are fighting hand in hand against American imperialism.

    After a while, the soldier woke up! His body moved! The military doctors and nurses shouted in unison: "Hurray!" They were as happy as if they had rescued their own brothers.

    In this hospital, with warm care, after more than twenty days of treatment, the soldier was about to be discharged and return to the battlefield. Although it was only a short twenty days, there was a close friendship between the military doctor and the soldier, as if they had lived together for more than twenty years. The soldier's name was Zhang Huaguo (transliteration), and he was wounded in the encirclement and attack of the enemy in the Cheongcheon River area.

    Before he set off, he stood in front of the military doctors and nurses, holding his gun, touching his wounded shoulder and said: "Your hot blood is boiling in my heart! The blood you gave me is beating in my blood vessels. The friendship that is united by hot blood will be forever consolidated and developed. For the independence of your motherland Korea, for our great China, I will contribute the blood that is exchanged with your blood, and go to the front again to bravely kill the enemy!"
              (Translated by Ding Min from "Labor News" in North Pyongan Province, Korea)

　　中朝人民热血交流的友谊
    （一）
    这是在英雄的中国人民志愿军的某野战病院里发生的事情。
    朝鲜人民军的金昌步战士，现正在这个野战病院受着亲切和周到的治疗。他述说了自己到中国人民志愿军的野战病院受治疗的经过：
    “那是在某日某一战线上发生的事情。我的任务是侦察前方敌阵。我沉着地深入敌阵，当我详细侦察了敌情后，于回队中途时，遭到敌人雨雹般的射击，肩膀上受了重伤。我振作精神，几次努力要站起来，但身体一点都不能动弹，终于昏迷过去了。”
    “就在这时候，走过这一带的中国人民志愿军的战友们，发现了我，即刻送到后方的野战病院，——就是我现在受着亲切看护的这个地方。”
    “中国张大夫，即刻施行紧急治疗，但由于我流血过多而引起了严重的贫血症，生命危险了……张大夫马上检查我的血型，发现了和他的血型一样。他为了救一个朝鲜人民的战士，豪不犹豫地立刻从自己身上抽出许多血，又亲自输给我。我由于张大夫的输血救援，终于脱离了险境。……这都是我后来听说才知道的。……”
    “张大夫高贵的牺牲精神，还不仅如此。上级知道了张大夫这个牺牲自己援救战士的行动后，为了照顾他的健康，以奖金表扬了他。但是，张大夫得来的钱，却买了鸡、鸡蛋等………，送给我吃。”
    “我就在张大夫这样热情和周到的照顾下，不但遇救了，而且不久可以回到前线了。”
    “……每逢我向他致谢时，他只说：‘我只做了我应该做的事情……我们为了打倒共同的敌人，我们不惜一切。’这样一句话。”
            （崔彬译自十二月三十日《民主朝鲜》）
  （二）
    李廷宇（译音）部队长所领导的朝鲜人民军某后方医院的军医和护士同志们，贡献出全部热情与力量医疗并看护着英勇的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队的伤员们。
    一天，军医与护士们到前方去医疗伤员的时候，遇到了一个身受重伤的志愿军战士，因为流血过多的缘故，他的脸色苍白，陷于昏迷状态。
    输血！军医和护士们立刻想到了这唯一而急救的办法。
    一分钟也不许停滞！军医和护士们决心要用一切办法救出这个为了人类正义而战斗的真实的人。
    快到外科室去！军医和护士们用担架把战士抬起来了。
    谁也没有说应该输谁的血，因为每一个人的心里都已经决定抽自己的血。
    到了外科室，护士们都各自准备着抽自己的血。军医同志很难决定应该用谁的血才对。这个时候，崔彩玉（译音）护士已经抽出了自己的血，拿着输血器跑到军医面前说：“我的血型和这个中国同志的血型是一样的，是Ｏ型。”她已经检验过这战士的血型。军医决定输崔彩玉同志的血。
    一ＣＣ，二ＣＣ……注视着自己的血输进战士的左腕，崔彩玉同志、军医和护士们，再一度深刻地感觉到在反对美帝国主义的斗争中携手奋起的朝中人民的巩固友谊。
    过了一些时候，战士醒过来了！身体动起来了！军医和护士们异口同声地喊出：“万岁！”他们高兴得像救出了自己的亲兄弟一样。
    在这个医院里，在温暖的看护中，治疗了二十多天，这个战士就要出院重新回到战场上去了。虽然是短短的二十多天，军医和这个战士之间已有了亲密的友情，他们好像一起生活了二十多年一样。这个战士的名字叫做张华国（译音），是在清川江一带包围敌人进击中受伤的。
    他在出发之前，站在军医和护士们的面前，拿着枪，摸着受伤的肩膀说：“在我的心脏里沸腾着你们的热血！你们给我的血在我的血管中跳动。以热血结合起来的友谊将永远巩固发展。我为了你们的祖国朝鲜的独立，为了我们伟大的中国，我将贡献出与你们的鲜血交流在一起的血，再到前线去勇敢杀敌！”
              （丁民译自朝鲜平北《劳动新闻》）
