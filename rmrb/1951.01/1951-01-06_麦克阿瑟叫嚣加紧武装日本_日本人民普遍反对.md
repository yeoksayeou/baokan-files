　　MacArthur Calls for Intensified Arming of Japan
　　Japanese People Widely Oppose
　　Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: MacArthur, the head of the American occupation forces in Japan, in his New Year's "Message to the Japanese People" on December 31, 1950, blatantly clamored to drive the Japanese people to serve as tools for the United States in carrying out aggression in the Far East. In his "Message," MacArthur referred to the movement of the world's people, especially the people of China and Korea, to resist American imperialist aggression as "international lawlessness." He threatened that if this "lawlessness" continues, the ideal of renouncing war stipulated in the Japanese Constitution "must give way to the irresistible law of self-preservation." "And your (referring to the Japanese people) duty is within the principles of the 'United Nations'," "to jointly gather strength to repel violence." The true meaning of MacArthur's "repelling violence" here is to attack the people's forces resisting American aggression. To this end, MacArthur openly advocated abandoning the provision in the Japanese Constitution regarding the renunciation of war. He said: This provision "too cautiously guides your thinking and your actions on national security issues, even without regard to the threat of the storm that is forming."
    However, the Japanese people today are unwilling to be driven by the invaders. Even an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st admitted that whether the Japanese people are happy about the prospect of intensified arming of Japan brought about by MacArthur's "Message" is "quite doubtful."
　　Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: Dentsu News Agency, London, January 4th: According to the "Daily Mail" Tokyo report: Japan generally opposes MacArthur's proposal to rearm Japan. The newspaper said that the Japanese "general public is unanimously opposed" to this proposal. The reaction of the Japanese people is the same as the reaction of the German people when the proposal to incorporate West German troops into the "European Army" was first put forward. MacArthur's headquarters was greatly surprised by the reaction of the Japanese people.
　　The "Daily Mail" also said: MacArthur's statement has "caused widespread criticism in other Pacific countries, including Australia and the Philippines."

　　麦克阿瑟叫嚣加紧武装日本
    日本人民普遍反对
    【新华社三日讯】美国驻日占领军首脑麦克阿瑟在其一九五○年十二月三十一日发表的新年《致日本人民书》中，公然叫嚣要驱策日本人民充当美国在远东进行侵略的工具。麦克阿瑟在他的《文告》中，将世界人民、特别是中、朝两国人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的运动称之为“国际的无法纪状态”。他威胁说：如果这种“无法纪状态”继续下去，日本宪法所规定的废弃战争的理想，就“必须让位于不可抵抗的自保的法则”。“而你们（按指日本人民）的职责就是在‘联合国’的原则以内”，“共同聚集力量以击退暴力”。麦克阿瑟这里所说的“击退暴力”，其真正的意思就是要进攻反抗美国侵略的人民力量。为此，麦克阿瑟公然鼓吹摈弃日本宪法上关于废弃战争的规定。他说：这个规定“过于审慎地指导着你们的思想以及你们在国家安全问题上的行动，甚至没有顾到正在形成中的暴风雨的威胁”。
    但是，今天的日本人民已不愿供侵略者驱使。甚至美联社东京一日电也承认：日本人对麦克阿瑟的《文告》所带来的加紧武装日本的前景是否感到愉快，“颇成疑问”。
    【新华社五日讯】电通社伦敦四日讯：据《每日邮报》东京消息称：日本普遍反对麦克阿瑟所提出的重新武装日本的建议。该报说：日本“一般老百姓都一致反对”这个建议。日本人民的反应与西德部队并入“欧洲军”的建议第一次提出时德国人民的反应是相同的。麦克阿瑟总部对日本人民的反应大为惊讶。
    《每日邮报》并说：麦克阿瑟的声明已“在其他太平洋国家中，包括澳大利亚和菲律宾在内，引起了普遍的抨击”。
