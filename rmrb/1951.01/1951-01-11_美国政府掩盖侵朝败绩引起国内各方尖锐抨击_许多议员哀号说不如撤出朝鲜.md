Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: The US government and military's futile attempts to conceal the US military's defeats have triggered sharp criticism within the United States. Even the Kuomintang remnant bandit's news agency, the Central News Agency, had to admit in a 5th dispatch that although US military spokesmen announced that the US military's retreat was "well-organized, meticulously planned, and far from a rout," "any explanation involving merely empty phrases cannot satisfy the American people, who are increasingly perplexed by the setbacks of the US military." The Washington Daily News mocked the official claim of "the completion of the withdrawal from Seoul" in an editorial, stating: Wars cannot be won by completing withdrawals or strategic retreats; no matter what orderly retreat or other military jargon is used, they are all used to conceal battlefield defeats. The newspaper despondently said: "This war was lost on the political and diplomatic fronts before it was lost on the battlefield."

Many reactionary newspapers and congressmen are now feeling hopeless about this endless defeat and are lamenting that it would be better for the US aggressor troops to simply withdraw from Korea. The Washington Post said that if the withdrawal from Korea has already been decided, it would be better to admit it frankly. In terms of prestige, it is better to announce a policy than to have it guessed or forced to be announced by others. Republican Congressman Wuther said: "We had better admit the mistakes that have been made and revise our foreign policy. The President and the State Department should stop trying to save face or prestige in the Far East, and immediately take action to save the lives of tens of thousands of our soldiers in Korea, so that they do not have to suffer unnecessary killings." Republican Senator Bridges suggested opening a so-called "second battlefield in Korea," but he apparently realized that his suggestion was akin to a daydream, and then regretfully said: "Otherwise, immediately withdraw the US troops," because "it is a sin to sit and let indefensible troops be slaughtered."

　　美国政府掩盖侵朝败绩引起国内各方尖锐抨击     
    许多议员哀号说不如撤出朝鲜
    【新华社十日讯】美国政府与军方徒然地掩饰美军败绩的企图，已引起美国国内的尖锐抨击。连国民党残匪的通讯社中央社五日电也不得不承认，虽然美国军方发言人宣布美军的后撤是“组织优良，计划精密，而且远非溃退。”然而“任何这种仅仅涉及空泛辞句的解释都不能满足美国人民，他们对于美军挫败日增困惑。”华盛顿每日新闻报在社论中讥刺官方所谓“汉城完成撤退”的说法称：战争不能以完成撤出或战略撤退取胜，不管是什么样的有秩序撤退，以及其他军用术语都是用以掩饰战场挫败的。该报丧气地说：“这一场战争在败于战场上之前，已败于政治及外交前线了。”
    许多反动报纸与议员现在对于这种无止境的溃败也已感到绝望而哀号美国侵略军不如干脆撤出朝鲜。华盛顿邮报说，如果撤离朝鲜一事已经决定，不如坦白承认。就威望来说，宣布政策比被别人猜着或被迫宣布还要好些。共和党议员伍瑟尔说：“我们最好还是承认已犯的错误，修订我们的外交政策。总统与国务院应停止在远东挽回面子或威望的努力，而即时采取行动，挽救我们在朝鲜的成万战士的生命，使他们不必遭受不必要的杀戮。”共和党重要参议员勃里奇建议开辟所谓“朝鲜第二战场”，但他显然发觉自己这一建议之无异梦呓，因而接着就懊丧地说：“要不然就立即撤退美军”。因为“坐令无法防守的军队被杀戮是一种罪恶”。
