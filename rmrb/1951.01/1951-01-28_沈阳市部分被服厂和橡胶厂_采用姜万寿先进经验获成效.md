　　Shenyang City's Partial Clothing Factories and Rubber Factories
　　Achieve Results by Adopting Jiang Wanshou's Advanced Experience
　　[Our Dispatch] Since Shenyang City's partial clothing factories and rubber factories recently adopted or referenced Jiang Wanshou's advanced experience in improving labor organization and increasing production, they have achieved initial results.
　　The No. 3 Clothing Factory of the Clothing Bureau first held a meeting to discuss and concluded that the main key to the factory's work lies in improving the skills of assistants and more meticulously and scientifically dividing the production process. Therefore, the entire factory put forward the slogan of strengthening mutual assistance and cooperation between skilled workers and assistants, and the factory's engineering section changed the previous twenty-one work process segments to forty-two. The implementation results proved that it can indeed avoid the past phenomenon of work stoppages waiting for materials, so the machine can fully exert its potential efficiency, greatly improving productivity.
　　The No. 10 Clothing Factory of the Clothing Bureau first promoted Jiang Wanshou's advanced experience in the clothing department, and as a result, one piece of work can be shortened by fifteen minutes compared to the past, and a batch of military blankets that used to take six days to complete now only took three days. The factory's shoe department has also begun to study and adopt this advanced production method.
　　The Shenhe District Federation of Trade Unions Clothing Factory quickly increased its output by 25% after adopting this new method; the quality also increased accordingly. The Nanshi District Military Dependents Clothing Factory immediately increased its output by 15% on the second day after implementing this new method.
　　In addition, rubber factories in light industry have also been discussing and referencing this advanced experience to improve labor organization. In order to carefully and precisely absorb this advanced experience, the No. 4 Rubber Factory specifically sent the workshop director to the No. 1 Clothing Factory to learn, so as to apply the new method of dividing labor for making cotton clothes to making shoes. The No. 5 and No. 7 Rubber Factories are also studying it. The Experimental Factory of the Clothing Bureau, which specializes in making shoes, also discovered that Jiang Wanshou's advanced production method can be implemented in its factory, and specifically organized a "Technology Promotion Committee" to lead the entire factory in implementing the new working method.
　　Editor's Note: Jiang Wanshou is the head of the engineering section of the No. 1 Clothing Factory. He was originally a worker in the factory and took on management work after making several major contributions. This time, he carefully studied and created a new production method, that is, to make the division of labor between skilled workers and assistants more reasonable, and to reduce the manual work of skilled workers as much as possible, so that skilled workers can control the machine and sew continuously. Since this new working method was implemented in October last year, it has proven not only to increase output, but also to reduce production costs. Taking December of last year as an example, the factory's output increased by 62%, and the cost decreased by 1.3 billion yuan (Northeast currency). This advanced production experience can be used as a learning model in the patriotic production competition to correct the bias of simply increasing labor intensity.

　　沈阳市部分被服厂和橡胶厂
    采用姜万寿先进经验获成效
    【本报讯】沈阳市部分被服厂、橡胶厂最近采用或参照姜万寿改进劳动组织提高生产的先进经验以来，已经获得初步成效。
    被服局第三工厂首先开会研讨，认为该厂工作的主要关键在于提高帮工技术和更细密而科学地划分生产过程。于是全厂提出了加强技工帮工之间互助合作的口号，该厂工务科并把过去二十一种工作过程分段改为四十二种。实行结果，确能避免过去停工待料现象，因而机器得以充分发挥潜在效能，使生产率大大提高。
    被服局第十工厂先在被服部推行姜万寿的先进经验，结果一件活可比以前缩短十五分钟时间，需要六天完成的一批军毯现只用了三天功夫便完成了。该厂皮鞋部也已开始研究采用这一先进生产方法。
    沈河区工联被服厂采用这个新的方法后，很快就将产量提高了百分之二十五；质量也跟着提高了。南市区军属被服厂在实施这个新方法后的第二天，产量当即提高了百分之十五。
    此外，轻工业中的各橡胶厂也纷纷讨论参照这个先进经验改进劳动组织。橡胶四厂为了慎重和精密吸取这个先进经验，以便把新的做棉服的分工方法用在做鞋上，特地派了车间主任到被服一厂去学习。橡胶五厂、七厂也正在研究。专门做鞋的被服局实验工厂也发觉姜万寿的先进生产方法可以在本厂施行，特组织了“技术推广委员会”来领导全厂实施新的工作方法。
    按：姜万寿是被服局第一工厂的工务科长，原为该厂工人，立了几次大功后担任管理工作。他这次悉心研究，又创出了新的生产方法，即是把技工与帮工之间的分工更加合理化，尽量减除技工的手工部分工作，以便使技工可以掌握机器不停地缝纫。这个新的工作方法从去年十月开始实行以来，证明不仅提高了产量，而且降低了生产成本。以去年十二月为例，该厂产量提高百分之六十二，成本则降低了十三亿元（东北币）。这种先进的生产经验，可以当作爱国主义生产竞赛中的学习榜样，用以纠正单纯提高劳动强度的偏向的。
