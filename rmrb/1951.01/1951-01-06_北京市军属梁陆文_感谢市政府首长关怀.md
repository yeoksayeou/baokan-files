Reader's Letters:

To the Honorable Mayors Nie, Zhang, and Wu of the Beijing Municipal People's Government:

I am a family member of a revolutionary soldier in Beijing. I was deeply moved to receive the New Year's card from you to us military families the day before yesterday. How could there have been such a thing in the past? Not to mention the mayor wishing ordinary people a happy New Year, even if ordinary people wished the mayor a happy New Year, they would not pay attention. Now that the people have stood up, it is very different.

My several children have all joined the revolution: some are participating in construction, and some have joined the army. Therefore, my neighbors and the People's Government respect me very much. I think: our family was originally an old family, and today we can be transformed into a revolutionary family and receive the glorious title of military family member. All of this is given to us by Chairman Mao. On this New Year, we respectfully wish Chairman Mao a long life.

The mayors told us to fully support the Korean War. I think, although I don't have much strength, I will definitely write to my children, asking each of them to work hard in their own positions and respond to the call of their superiors without any worries. Only in this way will they be worthy of being good sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and also my good children.

Wishing you good health!

　　北京市军属梁陆文
    感谢市政府首长关怀北京市人民政府聂、张、吴诸位市长：
    我是北京市一个革命军人家属，前天接到您们给我们军属的贺年片，使我非常感动。过去那有这种事？别说市长给老百姓拜年，就是老百姓给市长拜年，他们还不理呢。现在人民翻了身，大大不同了。
    我的几个孩子全参加革命了：有的参加建设，有的参了军。因此，左邻右舍和人民政府都很尊敬我。我想：我们本是一个旧家庭，今天能转变为一个革命家庭，得到光荣的军属称号，这都是毛主席给我们的。在这新年的时候，我们敬祝毛主席万寿无疆。
    诸位市长告诉我们要以全力支援朝鲜战争。我想，我虽没有什么大力量，但是我一定给孩子们写信，要他们每个人在自己岗位上努力工作，毫无顾虑地响应上级的号召。这样，他们才不愧是中国人民的好儿女，也就是我的好孩子了。
    祝您们健康！
