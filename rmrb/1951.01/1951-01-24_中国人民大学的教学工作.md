　　The Teaching Work of Renmin University of China
    Zhang Tengxiao
      I. Curriculum
    Under the direct assistance of dozens of Soviet education experts and based on the needs of our country's current construction and the rich experience of Soviet higher education over the past thirty years, Renmin University of China formulated two complete sets of education plans, undergraduate and specialized, at the beginning of the semester. It specifies in detail all courses for each department and class, as well as the key points, hours, and steps of implementation.
    The curriculum includes all aspects. Marxism-Leninism, Political Economy, Theory of State and Law, History of the Chinese Revolution, Principles of People's Democracy, Russian, and Physical Education are common courses for all departments. Each department also sets up complete professional and cultural courses according to the specific purpose of cultivating students. In total, there are 142 courses for undergraduates, of which political theory courses account for 20% to 25%; cultural courses account for 20%; and professional courses account for 50% to 55%. There are 83 courses for each specialized class, of which political theory courses account for 26% for the History, Geography, and Education classes, professional courses account for 74%, and for the remaining classes political theory courses account for 37% and professional courses account for 23%. What are the characteristics of these courses?
    (1) We use the most advanced political theory to arm students, which accounts for 20% to 25% of the curriculum and is the soul of the entire curriculum. This means that no matter what kind of cadres each department will cultivate in the future, and no matter what kind of profession they study, they must understand the science of political theory, have a correct outlook on life and the world, understand the laws of social development, know the past, present, and future of human society, and actively fight for the realization of the new society. Only in this way can they consciously serve the construction of the new China with the professional knowledge they have learned.
    (2) Our curriculum is comprehensive. The old bourgeois education often focused on fragmented technical knowledge. Therefore, the students they cultivated were extremely narrow-minded, lacked systematic knowledge, and lacked the necessary connections in related fields. Our professional courses not only have specific and rich practical knowledge, but also have general principles of knowledge and necessary connections. The cooperative courses not only enable students to understand how to run production or consumer cooperatives well, how to raise shares and distribute dividends, how to connect with the masses, etc., but also to understand the basic theories of cooperatives, and the basic differences between cooperatives under the capitalist system and cooperatives under the socialist system and the new democratic system. The trade courses not only enable students to understand how to grasp market information, how to inspect commodities, and how to establish accounting systems, etc., but also to understand the basic knowledge of economics and trade theory. When we study the business of our own department, we must also understand all the knowledge that is directly related to our department.
    (3) Our curriculum is concrete. By concrete, we mean that it meets actual needs. We do not have so-called professional courses that are general, impractical, and unable to solve a specific problem. Any professional course we set up meets actual needs and is intended to solve a specific problem. Actual needs are developing. Therefore, we must not only meet the immediate needs, but also take into account the needs of future development and the prospects of the new China. All our professional courses tightly grasp this point.
    (4) Our curriculum is concise and essential. By concise and essential, we mean that our curriculum has a high degree of logic and systematicness. The accumulation of superficial phenomena and accidental materials is not allowed. The courses are not isolated from each other, but are organically connected, supplemented, and developed. Within a course, students are given a systematic and historical understanding based on logical necessity. When we talk about the state, it is not the so-called three elements of the state, but how the state is produced and becomes a machine for the oppression of the exploiting classes, how it serves the people, and how it will inevitably decline in the future. When we talk about finance, we do not talk about "expenditure theory," "income theory," "public debt theory," and "financial administration theory" in isolation from the essence of the class state, but we want to analyze the state finance in various societies in history, the finance of capitalist countries, socialist countries, and people's democratic countries, according to the historical materialist viewpoint, so as to understand the class nature of finance and its laws of development, and further understand the essence of finance and its different roles in different historical stages.
  II. Teaching Process
    Our education is a scientific education based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. It not only requires systematic theoretical knowledge, but also requires this systematic theoretical knowledge to come from rich practice and to guide practice. It not only emphasizes systematic teaching, but also attaches great importance to the practice and practical application of various subjects. Therefore, in the teaching process, we first emphasize systematic classroom teaching, which is an important place for us to impart knowledge. No student is allowed to ask for leave or be absent from class without a good reason, or to underestimate the importance of learning, or to be distracted in class. Teachers should teach with a fully responsible spirit, not only to ensure the scientific nature of the content, the novelty and richness of the materials, but also to pay attention to the logic of the teaching and the liveliness of the methods, so as to enable students to understand the entire content as much as possible. Teachers should have a high degree of labor discipline, and should not ask for leave, arrive late, or leave early at will. All "seminars," internships, experiments, etc., must be carried out under systematic teaching. Any isolated internships, experiments, etc., that are separated from systematic knowledge are incorrect.
    However, it is not enough to rely solely on teaching. Experience has shown that relying solely on teaching not only fails to provide students with opportunities for application and to understand accurate knowledge, but also makes it impossible to fully understand the content of the lectures. Therefore, in the teaching process, we also adopt various internship methods, including internships, experiments, visits, "seminar" learning, and production internships. The most distinctive features are "seminar" learning and production internships.
    "Seminar" learning is mainly in the area of theoretical learning. This kind of learning is to conduct discussions on the content of the course under the direct guidance of the teacher, with leadership, planning, and emphasis. Usually, after the teacher conducts systematic teaching, the teacher first proposes discussion topics and designates the necessary reference books, then the students conduct in-depth self-study and research, make the necessary speaking outlines, and then speak in class according to the prescribed topics, either designated by the teacher or automatically by the students, and then the teacher makes the necessary conclusions based on the students' opinions. If the purpose of other course internships and experiments is to enable students to deeply understand the content of the lectures, consolidate their memory, and be able to apply them skillfully, then the purpose of this kind of "seminar" learning is to deeply understand the content of the lectures and cultivate students' ability to analyze problems concretely and explain problems systematically. Therefore, students' speeches, except for supplementary speeches, should generally not be too short, because too short will hinder students from making systematic explanations of the problem. However, it should not be too long, because too long will affect other students' speeches. This kind of "seminar" learning is a big step forward compared to group discussion meetings. Generally speaking, group meetings are conducted in an unorganized state. It is not necessary to go through systematic preparation beforehand. During the discussion, you just "listen," and even hold a contemptuous or perfunctory attitude towards other people's opinions. You don't have to speak, or your speech has not been fully prepared. You just hear other people's opinions and temporarily evoke some of your own emotional opinions. This will encourage intellectual laziness. At the same time, it is not easy to draw correct conclusions from the results of the discussion. This kind of "seminar" learning is conducted under the direct guidance of the teacher. Every student must make full preparations, and every student has the possibility of being designated by the teacher to speak. At the same time, every student must pay attention to other people's opinions, and every student has the possibility of being designated by the teacher to correct other people's speaking errors. Therefore, in theoretical learning, we generally abolish the method of group discussion meetings. According to the experience of this semester, students unanimously believe that this kind of "seminar" learning is necessary, and in the teaching process, some of our teaching and research sections have also explored some successful experiences.
    Production internship occupies a very important position in our entire education plan. It is to actually work in factories, mines, banks, enterprises, and government agencies. Generally, it starts in the second academic year, which means that students have learned systematic knowledge and have the opportunity to apply it to actual work. This kind of internship is generally once or twice for each course, and the duration is about three to five weeks. Although there were internships in the old schools, they were often formal and not actually done. Our production internship is completely different. Students who go to factories, banks, and stores for internships are real workers, bank clerks, and store clerks. They must do all the things that workers, bank clerks, and store clerks have to do. It is not allowed to hold the so-called "internship" point of view. This can not only enable students to combine theory with practice and learn practical knowledge, but also enable them to actually work in the internship agencies. The meaning of the so-called production internship is also here.
    In the teaching process, after classroom teaching and "seminar" learning, etc., when some students still cannot understand well, the teacher must give students guidance, which is to let students ask questions and the teacher answer them. Guidance is for students to participate voluntarily, but when the head of the department or the teacher knows that some students have not understood and are unwilling to participate in the guidance, they can also designate these students to participate in the guidance. At the beginning, some teachers of political theory courses felt it was "troublesome," and some teachers were afraid that students would raise questions that they could not answer, and were unwilling to provide guidance. A small number of students felt that the teacher's answers could not meet their requirements, and also expressed indifference to the guidance. However, due to our teachers' efforts to prepare for teaching, especially with the help of Soviet experts, who personally participated in the guidance and patiently answered every question, big or small, everyone's opinions on the guidance became less and less, and a fixed system was gradually formed. This kind of guidance is a big step forward compared to mutual aid groups. It is very inappropriate to make students' mutual assistance a system in formal learning, because this can affect the learning of students with a high level. Therefore, we generally do not adopt this form of mutual assistance now.
    Therefore, lecturing, "seminar" internships, and guidance are three indispensable links in our teaching process. Experience has shown that the teaching and research section that performs these three links well teaches the courses it is responsible for well, and students make significant progress. This semester, our students have made extremely rapid progress and are able to understand the content of the courses. In particular, some workers and cadres with lower cultural levels have also made rapid progress.
  III. How to Strengthen Teaching Effectiveness and Improve Teaching Quality
    In order to better realize the teaching process and improve teaching effectiveness, we believe that attention must be paid to the following issues:
    (1) Strengthening the work of the teaching and research section is an important key to improving teaching quality. All teaching and research sections must constantly study the improvement and improvement of teaching work. In the current situation, to improve the quality of teaching, we must first improve the quality of teachers. Because any good course, if it is not well implemented by a teacher who is competent, is still impossible to achieve well. Secondly, we have adopted the teacher responsibility system, which means that the teacher is responsible for guiding the courses he or she teaches throughout the entire learning process of the students.
    (2) There must be a high degree of planning in the teaching process. As mentioned earlier, each undergraduate department has a total of 142 courses. Without careful planning, it is difficult to realize them. Not only must there be general plans, such as the courses, hours, and schedules for each semester, but also specific implementation plans. What kind of plans do we have in the teaching process? First of all, we must formulate a course schedule for a semester based on the entire education plan. This is the general basis for all teaching staff to carry out their work. Teachers must make a work plan for their own semester, including class and internship hours, scientific research work, and improvement of teaching work. Then, on the one hand, the teacher must have a teaching syllabus, and formulate a daily implementation plan based on the teaching syllabus, including class, week, time, and classroom. On the other hand, the teacher must also have a teaching outline, including the main content and arguments of the course, to conduct teaching, and finally write a textbook based on the teaching outline. The teaching and research section, the department, and the teaching affairs department formulate their own work plans based on the overall teaching plan and the teacher's work plan. Only in this way can the teacher complete all the teaching content he or she is going to complete in the entire semester in a planned manner. In short, in our entire school, the head of each department and class, and the head of the teaching affairs department and the president must have a very clear understanding of what courses each department, each class, and each student are taking and what activities they are doing every hour, so as to conduct inspections at any time.
    However, we have encountered some difficulties in the process of implementation. Because some teachers' guerrilla habits have not been completely eliminated, they feel it is "troublesome" and "extra burden." Therefore, either they do not have a good plan, or they do not know how to use it well, so that the plan is separated from reality and becomes a formality. This deviation must be overcome.
    (3) There must be a high degree of organization in the teaching process. Any phenomenon of freedom and looseness is harmful to learning. It is not allowed for students and teachers to be late, leave early, ask for leave at will, or not attend classes at Renmin University of China. Except for sick leave, any leave of absence for any accident is considered to have no legitimate reason for teachers and students. Teachers must treat their work seriously and not allow any perfunctory and irresponsible phenomena. They must personally grade students' homework. Students must answer the questions raised by the teacher and must complete the homework assigned by the teacher.
    However, does this mean that we ignore students' self-study and independent research? Not at all. In addition to the school's prescribed class time, students can conduct independent research according to their own interests. According to the provisions of our education plan, as students' grades increase, we must also leave more time for free research and encourage independent research. However, this kind of independent research and classroom teaching are not opposed to each other, but complement each other.
    (4) There must be a strict inspection system in the teaching process to ensure the implementation of our teaching work and the improvement of quality. In order to understand a certain course or the course taught by a certain teacher in a focused way, we plan to send stenographers to listen to the class, take notes, and then conduct research. We compile supervisors to regularly understand the staffing and work of each teaching and research section in order to put forward suggestions for improvement. At the same time, we formulate systematic statistical forms and report to the teaching affairs department by department on a monthly basis.
    As for the examination system, we also completely adopt new and more scientific methods, abolish the percentage grading system, and adopt the four-point grading system of excellent, good, medium (pass), and poor.

　　中国人民大学的教学工作
    张腾霄
      一  课程
    中国人民大学在苏联数十位教育专家直接帮助下，根据我国目前建设的需要与苏联高等教育三十多年来丰富的经验，于开学之初，就制订了本科与专修科两套完整的教育计划，它详细的规定了各系、班所有课程，以及实施的重点、时数与步骤。
    课程是包括各个方面的。马列主义、政治经济学、国家与法权理论、中国革命史、人民民主原理、俄文、体育为各系共同的课程。各系又根据其培养学生的具体目的，设立完备的业务课程与文化课程。计本科总共为一四二门课程，其中政治理论课占百分之二十至二十五；文化课占百分之二十；业务课占百分之五十至五十五。专修科各班总共为八十三门课程，其中史地、教育两班政治理论课占百分之二十六；业务课占百分之七十四，其余各班政治理论课占百分之三十七，业务课占百分之二十三。这些课程都有些什么特点呢？
    （一）我们是以最前进的政治理论去武装学生，它占课程比重百分之二十至二十五，是全部课程的灵魂。这就是说各系不论将来培养什么样的干部，学习什么样的业务，他们都必须懂得政治理论的科学，有正确的人生观与世界观，懂得社会发展的规律，知道人类社会的过去、现在与未来，并积极的为新社会的实现而斗争。只有如此，才能把已学到的业务知识，自觉的为新中国的建设服务。
    （二）我们的课程是全面的。旧的资产阶级教育，常常注意一些零零碎碎的技术知识，因此，他们培养的学生极端偏狭，缺乏系统的知识，缺乏有关方面的必要的联系。我们的业务课程，不但有具体的丰富的实际知识，而且有一般的原理的知识，有必要的联系。合作社的课程不但要使学生懂得如何办好生产或消费合作社，如何集股和分红，如何联系群众等等，而且要懂得合作社的基本理论，资本主义制度下的合作社与社会主义制度及新民主主义制度下合作社的基本区别。贸易的课程不但要使学生懂得如何掌握商情？如何对于商品检查？以及如何建立会计制度等等，而且要懂得经济和贸易理论的基本知识。我们学习本部门的业务，还必须懂得和本部门有直接联系的一切知识。
    （三）我们的课程是具体的，所谓具体的，就是切合实际的需要，我们没有一般的不切合实际需要的不能解决某一具体问题的所谓业务课程，我们所设立的任何业务课，都是切合实际需要的，都是为了解决某一实际的问题。实际需要是发展的，因此，我们不但要满足眼前的需要，而且要照顾到将来发展的需要，照顾到新中国的远景；而我们所有的业务的课程无不是紧紧的把握了这一点。
    （四）我们的课程是精要的。所谓精要的，就是我们的课程有高度的逻辑性与系统性。不允许有表面现象的罗列和偶然材料的堆积。课程与课程之间，决不是孤立的，而是相互有机的联系着、补充着和发展着。在一个课程之内，都是根据逻辑的必然性给学生以系统的历史的了解。我们讲国家，就不是所谓国家三要素，而是国家是如何产生成为剥削阶级压迫的机器，如何为人民服务，以及将来必然衰亡等等。我们讲财政，就不是孤立的脱离阶级国家本质的去讲什么“支出论”、“收入论”、“公债论”以及“财务行政论”，而是要根据历史唯物观点去分析历史上各个社会内国家的财政，现在资本主义国家、社会主义国家、人民民主国家的财政，从而了解财政的阶级性及其发展规律，并进一步了解财政的本质及其在不同历史阶段的不同作用。
  二  教学过程
    我们的教育，是采用苏联的先进经验而制定的科学的教育。它不但要求有系统的理论知识，而且还要这种系统的理论知识，是从丰富的实际中来的，又给实际以指导；它不但强调要进行系统的讲授，而且还非常重视各科的实习，实际的应用。因此，我们在教学过程中，首先就重视课堂系统的讲授，它是我们传授知识重要的场所。任何学生都不允许随便请假或无故缺课，以及思想上的轻视，在讲课时精神的涣散。教员讲课要以完全负责的精神，不但要做到内容的科学性、材料的新颖与丰富，而且要注意讲授的逻辑性，方式上的生动活泼，以便使学生尽可能领会全部的内容。教员要有高度的劳动纪律，不随便请假迟到与早退。所有的“习明纳尔”（СеминаΡ）实习实验等，都是要在系统的讲授下进行的，脱离了系统的知识，而任何孤立的实习实验等都是不正确的。
    但是仅仅依靠进行讲授是不够的。经验证明仅仅依靠讲授不但不能够使学生得到应用的机会，领会确实的知识，而且也不可能全部领会讲授的内容。因此，我们在教学过程中，还采用各种实习方式，这些实习方式有实习、实验、参观、“习明纳尔”的学习和生产实习等。而最具有特色的是“习明纳尔”的学习和生产实习。
    “习明纳尔”的学习，主要是在理论学习方面。这种学习就是在教师直接指导下，有领导、有计划、有重点的进行关于课程内容的讨论。通常是在教师进行系统讲授之后，首先由教员拟出讨论题目，并指定必需的参考书籍，然后经过学生深入的自学研究，做出必要的发言提纲，然后在课堂上根据规定的题目，或由教员指定或由同学自动发言，然后教员根据学生的意见，作出必要的结论。如果说其他课程的实习实验在于使同学深刻领会讲授的内容，巩固记忆，并能熟练的应用，那么这种“习明纳尔”的学习，便是要深入领会讲授的内容，养成同学具体分析问题和系统说明问题的能力。因此，学生的发言，除了带补充性的发言外，一般的不宜过短，因为过短便会妨碍学生对问题作系统的说明。但也不宜过长，过长则影响其他同学发言。这种“习明纳尔”的学习，较之小组讨论会大大的提高了一步，一般说来小组会是在无组织的状态下进行的，事先可以不经过系统的准备，讨论时只是“听一听”，甚至对别人的意见持着轻蔑的或马虎的态度，自己可以不发言，或发言没有经过充分的准备，只是听到别人的意见，临时引起自己一些感想式的意见，这样便助长了思想上的懒汉。同时讨论的结果还不容易得出正确的结论。这种“习明纳尔”的学习，是在教员直接指导下进行的，每一个学生都要作充分的准备，都有被教员指定发言的可能，同时每一个学生都要注意别人的意见，都有被教员指定纠正别人发言错误的可能。因此，在理论学习中，我们一般废除了小组讨论会的方式。根据这一学期来的经验，学生对于“习明纳尔”这种学习方式一致认为是需要的，并且教学过程中，我们有的教研室也摸索到一些成功的经验。
    生产实习在我们整个教育计划中，占着十分重要的地位，它是要到工厂、矿山、银行企业机关实际去做的，一般都是在第二学年开始进行，就是说同学学习了系统的知识，到实际工作中得到应用的机会。这种实习，一般的课程都有一、两次，时间约三五礼拜不等。在旧的学校虽然也有实习，但那常常是形式的，不是实际去做的。我们的生产实习就完全不同了，学生到工厂、银行、商店实习，就是一个真正的工人、行员和店员，必须做工人、行员、店员所要做的全部事情，不允许抱着所谓“实习”的观点，这不仅能使学生理论与实际结合，学习实际的知识，而且能够真正在实习的机关进行工作，所谓生产实习，意义也即在此。
    在教学过程中，经过课堂讲授和“习明纳尔”等的学习，有的同学还不能很好领会的时候，教员就必须给学生进行辅导，就是让学生质疑，教员解答。辅导是要学生自愿参加的，但系主任或教员确实知道有的学生没有领会而又不愿参加辅导的时候，也可以指定这些学生参加辅导。我们在开始时，政治理论课有的教员嫌“麻烦”，有的教员怕学生提出自己不能回答的问题，不愿进行辅导，少数的学生感到教员所回答不能满足自己的要求，也对于辅导表示了冷淡。但是由于我们教员的努力准备教学，特别是苏联专家的帮助，他们亲自参加辅导，耐心的给学生解答每一个大小的问题，因而大家对于辅导的意见越来越少了，并逐渐形成了固定的制度。这种辅导比互助组是大大的提高了一步。在正规学习中把同学的互助订为一种制度，是很不相宜的，因为这样可以影响程度高的同学的学习。因此，我们现在一般的不采取这种互助的形式。
    因此，讲授、“习明纳尔”实习和辅导是我们教学过程中三个不可缺少的环节。经验证明，那个教研室对这三个环节执行得好，那个教研室所任的课程就教得好，同学就得到显著的提高。这一学期我们同学的进步是极快的，都能够领会课程的内容。特别是有些工人和文化较低的干部他们的进步同样是很快的。
  三  如何加强教学效果，提高教学质量
    为了更好的实现教学过程，提高教学效果，我们认为必须注意如下的问题：
    （一）加强教研室工作是提高教学质量的重要关键。所有教研室都要经常不断研究教学工作的提高与改进。在目前情况下，要提高教学的质量首先要提高教员的素养。因为任何好的课程，如果没有足以胜任的教员担任讲课还是不可能很好实现的。其次，我们采取了教员负责制，就是教员对他所教课程，在学生学习的全部过程中，都要负指导的责任。
    （二）在教学过程中要有高度的计划性。如前所述，本科各系共有一百四十二门课程，如无周密的计划，是很难见诸实现的。不但要有一般的计划，如每学期的课程、时数、课程表等等，而且要有具体执行的计划。我们在教学过程中都有些什么计划呢？首先要根据整个教育计划，拟出一学期的课程表，这是一切教学人员进行工作的总依据。教员要订出自己一学期的工作计划，包括上课和实习时数，科学研究工作，和改进教学工作。然后教员一方面要有讲授大纲，根据讲授大纲订出逐日执行计划，包括班次周次时间和教室。一方面还要有讲授提纲，包括课程的主要的内容和论点，去进行讲授，最后再根据讲授提纲写出讲义来。教研室、系、教务部根据总的教学计划和教员工作计划，订出自己的工作计划来。只有这样，教员才能很有计划的完成他全学期所要完成的全部教学内容。总之，在我们整个学校里，对于每系每班学生每小时上什么课程，做什么活动，由系主任到教务部长校长都要有十分清楚的了解，以便随时进行检查。
    然而在我们执行过程中是曾经遇到一些困难的。由于某些教员游击习气没有全部清除，他们感到是“麻烦”，是“额外负担”，因之，或者没有很好的计划，或者不知道很好的使用，使计划和实际脱节，以至流为形式，这种偏向是必须克服的。
    （三）在教学过程中要有高度的组织性，任何自由散漫的现象，对学习都是有害的。学生和教员迟到早退，随便请假或不上课现象在中国人民大学都是不允许的。教员和学生除了病假之外，因任何事故请假，都认为是没有正当理由的。教员必须严肃对待自己的工作，不允许任何马虎和不负责任的现象，要亲自给学生批改作业。学生必须回答教员所提出来的问题，必须完成教员所留给的作业。
    然而这样是不是忽视学生的自学，学生的独立研究呢？完全不是的。除了学校规定的上课时间之外，尽可以根据自己的爱好进行独立的研究，根据我们教育计划的规定，随着学生年级的增加，还要多留给自由研究的时间提倡进行独立的研究。不过这种独立研究和课堂教学并不是相对立的，而是相辅而行的。
    （四）在教学过程中要有严格的检查制度，以保障我们教学工作的贯彻和质量的提高。为了有重点的了解某一门课程或某教员担任的课程，有计划的派速记员听课，速记下来，然后进行研究。编制视导员经常了解各教研室的人员配备和工作情况，以便提出改进意见。同时制定系统的统计表格，逐月由系向教务部报告。
    至于考试制度，我们也完全采取新的较科学的方法，废除了百分制记分法，采取了优，良，中（及格），劣四分制记分法。
