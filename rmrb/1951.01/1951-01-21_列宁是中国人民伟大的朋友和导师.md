Lenin passed away twenty-seven years ago. Twenty-seven years ago, advanced people in China and all over the world mourned this great world figure who engaged in the earth-shattering cause of the proletariat with the same feelings as the Soviet people, and vowed to continue his cause and move forward.

The Chinese people are very familiar with Lenin, regarding him as the banner of the struggle of laborers in all countries of the world, and regarding him as a great friend and teacher of the Chinese people.

Lenin always cared about, sympathized with, and aided the struggle of the Chinese people, and made extremely high evaluations of the significance of the Chinese people's struggle.

When capitalist robbers from various countries and the Russian Tsar marched into China in 1900 and suppressed the Chinese Boxer Movement with extremely barbaric means, Lenin stood enthusiastically on the side of the Chinese people. He analyzed the question of "Why do Chinese attack Europeans" and severely refuted all the nonsense of the invading robbers. He wrote:

"…Yes, the Chinese do hate Europeans, but what kind of Europeans do they hate and why? The Chinese people do not hate the European people, because they have no conflict with the European people, they hate the European capitalists and the European governments who are submissive to the capitalists. Those who come to China only to make money, those who use their praised civilization only to deceive, plunder, and commit atrocities, those who wage war against China only to obtain the right to sell opium that poisons the people (the Anglo-French war against China in 1856), can the Chinese people not hate them?" (Lenin: "The Chinese War," "Iskra" No. 1, December 1900)

These are words written by Lenin fifty years ago, and when we read them now, they are still so kind! These words seem to be written to the American imperialism and its partners now. Lenin profoundly knew the people of China.

In August 1908, in the article "Inflammable Material in World Politics", Lenin made the following prediction about the development of the Chinese revolution:

"In China, the revolutionary movement against medieval institutions has also manifested itself with particular force in recent months. Of course, no definite conclusions can yet be drawn about this movement – because there is little news about the movement, and a lot of news about disturbances in various parts of China; however, the strong development of the Chinese 'new spirit' and 'European ideas', especially after the Russo-Japanese War, is beyond doubt; therefore, the transformation of the old-style Chinese rebellion into a conscious democratic movement is also inevitable."

About three years after Lenin's article, in October 1911, a revolution to overthrow the Qing Dynasty appeared in China. The incident completely confirmed Lenin's prediction.

Lenin warmly welcomed this Chinese revolution. The resolution of the Prague Conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in January 1912 wrote:

"The conference points out the world significance of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, because this revolutionary struggle will liberate Asia and destroy the rule of the European bourgeoisie; it welcomes the Chinese republican revolutionaries; it shows that the Russian proletariat watches the success of the Chinese revolution with sincere excitement and full sympathy..."

Subsequently, Lenin continued to write several papers discussing the Chinese revolution. In his outstanding work "Democracy and Populism in China," Lenin pointed out the extremely noble character of the Chinese people: "This great people is not only good at lamenting their long-term slavery, not only good at dreaming of freedom and equality, but also good at fighting those who have long oppressed China."

Lenin praised the fighting democracy of Sun Yat-sen, the great Chinese revolutionary, regarding "land nationalization": "Directly raising the issue of the living conditions of the masses, the struggle of the masses, warmly sympathizing with the laborers and the exploited, and believing in their integrity and their strength." Lenin believed: "This is the truly great thought of a truly great people."

In several papers at that time, Lenin almost repeatedly used similar words to cheer for the struggle of the Chinese people, and pointed out the unstoppable active force of the Chinese people. For example, Lenin's article "Regenerated China" wrote:

"A quarter of the world's population can be said to have moved from sleep to light, to movement, to struggle."

The article "The Awakening of Asia" begins by saying:

"Isn't China long known as the typical country of long-term complete stagnation? But now China's political life is boiling, and the upsurge of social movements and democracy is as turbulent as a stream."

Lenin had an article with the title: "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia." Here he wrote again:

"Hundreds of millions of people have awakened from their dreams, striving for survival, striving for light, striving for freedom. How joyful are all conscious workers who deeply know that only through democracy can collectivism be achieved, to witness this world movement! How full of sympathy are all just democrats for the young Asia!"

On the other hand, Lenin pointed out the Western bourgeoisie's desire to plunder China, divide China, and seize Chinese territory, and pointed out their extreme hostility to the Chinese revolution and their conspiracy to strangle the Chinese revolution. Lenin wrote:

"And what about 'advanced' Europe (Note: Lenin refers to the bourgeoisie of Europe)? It is plundering China, helping the enemies of Chinese democracy and the enemies of freedom!"

Lenin attacked the Western bourgeoisie for lending money to Yuan Shikai to oppose the Chinese democratic movement. This Yuan Shikai, as Lenin described, was an ambitious, traitorous, and friend of reactionary forces. Lenin pointed out:

"All the ruling forces in Europe, the entire European bourgeoisie, will form an alliance with all the reactionary and medieval forces in China."

Although the fruits of the 1911 revolution were usurped by Yuan Shikai, a running dog of imperialism, Lenin still believed that the regeneration of China was irresistible. In March 1913, Lenin's famous article "The Historical Destiny of the Doctrine of Marx" already said:

"No matter what the fate of the great Chinese Republic, which the 'civilized' jackals are now grinding their teeth to devour, there is no force in the world that can restore the old serf system in Asia, or eradicate the heroic democratic spirit of the masses of people in Asian countries."

During the period of the First Imperialist War, Lenin continued to care about the fate of the Chinese people in his works. His great work "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" pointed out the struggle of the imperialists to divide China, and particularly pointed out that "the struggle between Japan, the United States and other countries to seize China is becoming increasingly acute."

Lenin opposed various erroneous views, explained the possibility of national liberation wars in the era of imperialism and the conditions for their victory, in order to encourage the struggle of the Chinese people and other oppressed nations. He said:

"In the era of imperialism, national wars on the part of colonies and semi-colonies are not only perhaps possible, but inevitable. Nearly one billion people live in colonies and semi-colonies (China, Turkey, Persia), i.e., more than half of the world's population. In these places, the national liberation movement is either already very strong, or it is growing and maturing. Any war is the continuation of policy by other means. The continuation of the national liberation policy of the colonies will inevitably be a national war of the colonies against imperialism." ("On Junius's Pamphlet," August 1916)

Of course, Lenin never looked at this issue in isolation, and never looked at the struggle of China in isolation. In the article "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia," after Lenin pointed out the alliance between the Western bourgeoisie and the Chinese reactionary forces, he immediately pointed out that the alliance between the Chinese working people and the world proletariat was an overwhelming force. During the period of the First Imperialist War, Lenin more often spoke of the extreme importance of combining the national liberation movement with the proletarian revolutionary movement.

The victory of the Russian proletariat in the October Revolution turned Lenin's great thought into the most concrete reality. Just as Comrade Stalin said: "The October Revolution established a link between the backward Eastern nations and the advanced Western nations, and involved them in a common camp of anti-imperialist struggle." (Stalin: "The October Revolution and the National Question")

After the October Socialist Revolution, the slogan of anti-imperialism became the most popular and widespread slogan among the oppressed people all over the world. On this point alone, Lenin's contribution to the oppressed people of all countries in the world is simply immeasurable. The Chinese people quickly accepted the encouragement of the October Socialist Revolution. The May Fourth Movement of 1919, which was a sign of a new period in the Chinese revolution, was, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "occurred under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin." (Mao Zedong: "On New Democracy")

The October Revolution abolished the unequal treaties of the Russian Tsar against China. When the Chinese people learned of this news, it caused very great excitement. The Chinese people cheered for Lenin and his comrade-in-arms Stalin's great policy. Stalin wrote in the October Revolution Commemoration Day in 1923: "Russia, which was formerly regarded as the banner of oppression in the eyes of the oppressed nations, has now become the banner of liberation after the establishment of a socialist state... The name of the leader of the October Revolution, the name of Comrade Lenin, has become the most beloved name in the mouths of the ravaged and oppressed peasants and revolutionary intellectuals in the colonies and unequal countries today..." (Stalin: "The October Revolution and the Question of the Middle Strata"). These words are all true.

Sun Yat-sen specifically established a revolutionary friendship with Lenin against imperialism after the October Revolution. This friendship played a great role in the struggle of the Chinese people.

Comrade Mao Zedong often said that it was the great Lenin and his great comrade-in-arms Stalin who, through the October Revolution, conveyed Marxism to the Chinese people. The combination of the Chinese workers' movement and Marxism gave rise to the great Communist Party of China. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party accepted the Bolshevik experience jointly created by Lenin and his comrade-in-arms Stalin, and regarded Bolshevism as a guide for our work.

Lenin made this extremely profound observation in his article "Democracy and Populism in China": "Without a high tide of true democracy, the Chinese people cannot truly get rid of thousands of years of slavery, because this high tide arouses the laboring masses and enables them to accomplish extraordinary deeds..." That is to say, if China is to realize true democracy and overthrow the long-term slavery system, it must go through a true large-scale people's revolution. However, as history has proven: The Chinese bourgeoisie is not capable of completing such a historical task, and this historical task falls on the shoulders of the Chinese proletariat. And the reason why the Chinese proletariat is able to lead the people's revolution and victoriously complete the task of liberating China is because the Chinese proletariat's party is established in accordance with the Leninist-Stalinist Bolshevik principles, and because the great leader of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong, correctly applied Bolshevism to China and brilliantly developed it under Chinese historical conditions.

Lenin's extremely brilliant scientific works such as "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," "State and Revolution," "Two Tactics," and "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" have armed Chinese revolutionaries and the Chinese people for thirty years. Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us that we must constantly draw wisdom from all of Lenin's works and avoid mistakes. The inspiration that these works have given to the Chinese Communists and the Chinese people is truly unlimited.

The great friend and teacher of the Chinese people, Lenin's assessment of the great strength and great role of the Chinese people has been completely proven by history. It is a pity that Lenin did not have time to see all the heroic undertakings of the Chinese people in the past twenty years.

In May 1913, Lenin wrote:

"The awakening of Asia and the beginning of the struggle of the advanced European proletariat to seize power marked a new era in world history that was opened at the beginning of the twentieth century." (Lenin: "The Awakening of Asia")

Ten years later, in March 1923, that is, several years after the proletariat had already seized power in Russia, Lenin wrote again:

"In the final analysis, the outcome of this struggle will depend on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., constitute the vast majority of the population. And it is this majority of the population that has been involved in the struggle for their own liberation at a very rapid pace in recent years. Therefore, from this point of view, there can be no doubt about what the final result of the world struggle will be. In this sense, the final victory of socialism is completely and unconditionally guaranteed." (Lenin: "Better Fewer, But Better")

The whole world is advancing in accordance with Lenin's scientific predictions. After the great Chinese people's revolution continued the great October Socialist Revolution and achieved victory, is it not even more certain that the complete demise of imperialism and the complete victory of people's democracy and socialism in the world have become inevitable? The glorious victory of the Chinese and Korean people in the war against aggression in Korea and the embarrassing defeat of American imperialism, as well as the victory of the Vietnamese people in the liberation war against French imperialism... Do not these facts more clearly depict the picture of imperialism's approaching doom?

Lenin was the first great teacher in the early twentieth century to call on and guide the oppressed people all over the world to bravely and victoriously march on imperialism.

Our teacher Lenin is immortal!

　　列宁是中国人民伟大的朋友和导师
    陈伯达
    列宁逝世已经二十七年了。在二十七年前，中国和世界各国先进的人们都怀了和苏维埃人民同样的心情，去哀悼这位从事无产阶级翻天覆地事业的世界伟大人物，并宣誓将继续他的事业而前进。
    中国人民很熟悉列宁，认为他是世界各国劳动者斗争的旗帜，认为他是中国人民伟大的朋友和导师。
    列宁一直关心、同情和援助中国人民的斗争，并且对于中国人民的斗争的意义，作了极高的评价。
    当一九○○年各国资本主义强盗和俄国沙皇向中国进军而用极野蛮的手段镇压中国义和团运动的时候，列宁热情地站在中国人民的方面。他分析“中国人为什么袭击欧洲人”这一个问题，严厉地驳斥了一切侵略强盗的胡说。他写道：
    “……是的，中国人确实是憎恶欧洲人，然而他们究竟憎恶那一种欧洲人，并且为了什么呢？中国人并不是憎恶欧洲人民，因为他们和欧洲人民并没有冲突，他们是憎恶欧洲资本家及对资本家驯服的欧洲各国政府。那些到了中国只是为了赚钱的人，那些利用其被称赞的文明只是为了欺骗、掠夺、暴行的人，那些对中国开战只是为了获得贩卖毒害人民的鸦片权的人（一八五六年的英法对华战争），中国人民能不憎恶他们吗？”（列宁：“中国的战争”，一九○○年十二月“火星报”第一期）
    这是列宁在五十年前写的文字，我们现在读来，还是何等的亲切呵！这些话在现在也就像是对着美帝国主义和他的伙伴而写的。列宁是深刻地知道了中国的人民的。
    一九○八年八月间，列宁在“世界政治上的引火物”一文中，对于中国革命的发展，作了以下的预见：
    “在中国，近几月来，反中世纪制度的革命运动也特别表现得厉害。固然，关于这个运动，还不能作出什么确定的结论来，——因为关于运动的消息很少，而关于中国各地变乱的消息很多；可是中国“新精神”及“欧洲思潮”的强烈发展，尤其是在日俄战争以后，那是不容置疑的；因之，旧式的中国叛乱之转变为自觉的民主运动，也是不可避免的。”
    离开列宁这篇文章约有三年时间，在一九一一年十月间，中国出现了推翻满清朝廷的革命。事变完全证实了列宁的预见。
    列宁热烈地欢迎了中国这个革命。一九一二年一月俄国社会民主工党普拉加代表会议的决议，曾经写道：
    “代表会议指出中国人民革命斗争的世界意义，因为这种革命斗争将使亚洲获得解放，摧毁欧洲资产阶级的统治；它欢迎中国的共和派革命者；它表明俄国无产阶级以衷诚的兴奋和充分的同情注视中国革命的人民之成功……”
    随后列宁即继续写出了好几篇论述中国革命的论文。在他的“中国民主主义与民粹主义”的杰出著作中，列宁指出了中国人民的极其高贵的品格：“这个伟大的人民不仅善于悲叹自己长期的奴隶状况，不仅善于梦想自由平等，而且还善于向长期压迫中国的人作斗争”。
    列宁称赞了中国的伟大革命家——孙中山关于“土地国有化”的战斗的民主主义：“直接提出群众生活状况、群众斗争的问题，热烈地同情劳动者和被剥削者，相信他们的正直与他们的力量”。列宁认为：“这是真正伟大的人民的真正伟大的思想”。
    在当时几篇论文中，列宁几乎是反复地用类似的字句来欢呼中国人民的斗争，并指出中国人民的不可止息的活跃的力量。例如，列宁的“更新的中国”一文写道：
    “地球上四分之一的人口，可说是已经由酣睡进到光明、进到运动、进到斗争了。”
    “亚洲的觉醒”一文开头就说：
    “中国不是早就以长期完全停滞的国度的典型而著名吗？但是现在中国的政治生活却沸腾起来了，社会运动和民主主义的高涨，好似流泉一般汹涌了。”
    列宁有一篇文章，用了这样个标题：“落后的欧洲和先进的亚洲”。他在这里又写道：
    “几万万人民已在睡梦中觉醒起来，争取生存，争取光明，争取自由了。一切深知只有经过民主制才能达到集体制的觉悟工人，目睹这一世界的运动，是表示如何的喜跃！一切公正的民主派，对于年青的亚洲，是充满如何的同情！”
    在另一方面，列宁则指出了西方资产阶级掠夺中国、瓜分中国、攫取中国领土的渴望，指出了它们的极端仇视中国革命和绞杀中国革命的阴谋。列宁写道：
    “而‘先进’的欧洲（按：列宁指欧洲的资产阶级）呢？它却在掠夺中国，却在帮助中国民主主义之仇敌和自由之仇敌！”
    列宁攻击西方资产阶级借款给袁世凯以反对中国的民主运动。这个袁世凯，照列宁的形容，就是野心家，卖国贼，反动势力的朋友。列宁指出：
    “欧洲一切当权的势力，整个的欧洲资产阶级，与中国一切反动的和中世纪的势力要结成联盟了。”
    虽则一九一一年的革命果实，竟被帝国主义的走狗袁世凯所篡窃，可是列宁依然认为中国的新生乃是不可抵抗的。在一九一三年三月间，列宁所作的名文“马克思学说的历史命运”就已经说过：
    “不管那些‘文明’豺狼现在所磨牙欲噬的伟大中华共和国的命运如何，但世界上决没有一种力量能在亚洲恢复旧有的农奴制度，能铲除亚洲国家里的人民群众的英勇的民主精神。”
    当第一次帝国主义大战的时期，列宁在他的著作中，继续关心了中国人民的命运。他的伟大著作“帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段”，指出了帝国主义者瓜分中国的斗争，并特别指出了“日、美等国之间夺取中国的斗争，日益尖锐起来”。
    列宁反对各种错误的见解，解释了帝国主义时代民族解放战争的可能性及其胜利条件，用以鼓励中国人民及其他被压迫民族的斗争。他说：
    “在帝国主义时代，殖民地和半殖民地方面的民族战争，不仅是也许会有的，而且是不可避免的。在殖民地和半殖民地（中国、土耳其、波斯）生活着将近十万万人，即全地球居民一半以上。在这些地方，民族解放运动不是已经很强大，便是生长着和成熟着。任何战争都是政策以别种手段之继续。殖民地的民族解放政策之继续，不可避免的将是殖民地方面反对帝国主义的民族战争。”（“论尤尼乌斯的小册子”，一九一六年八月）
    当然，列宁从来不是孤立地去看待这个问题，从来不是孤立地去看待中国的斗争。在“落后的欧洲和先进的亚洲”一文，列宁指出了西方资产阶级和中国反动势力的联盟之后，马上即指出了中国劳动人民和世界无产阶级的联盟乃是压倒一切的力量。在第一次帝国主义大战的时期中，列宁就更经常说到了民族解放运动和无产阶级革命运动相结合的极端重要性。
    俄国无产阶级在十月革命的胜利，把列宁这个伟大的思想变成最具体的现实。恰如斯大林同志所说：“十月革命便在落后的东方民族和先进的西方民族之间建立了一种联系，把他们卷入在一个反帝国主义斗争的共同营垒里面来了。”（斯大林：“十月革命与民族问题”）
    在十月社会主义革命之后，反帝国主义的口号成为全世界被压迫人民中最通俗最普遍的口号了。仅在这点上，列宁对于世界各国被压迫人民的贡献，也简直是无法计量的。中国人民很迅速地接受十月社会主义革命的鼓舞。成为中国革命新时期标志的一九一九年反帝国主义和反封建的五四运动，恰如毛泽东同志所说，“是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的。”（毛泽东：“新民主主义论”）
    十月革命废除了俄国沙皇对于中国的不平等条约。当中国人民知道这个消息的时候，即引起了非常大的激动。中国人民欢呼了列宁和他的战友斯大林的伟大政策。斯大林在一九二三年的十月革命纪念节写道：“俄罗斯从前在被压迫民族的眼中被看做压迫的旗帜，现在成立社会主义国家之后，它已变成了解放的旗帜了。……十月革命领袖的名字，列宁同志的名字，在今日成为殖民地和不平等国度被蹂躏和被压抑的农民和革命知识分子口中最亲爱的名字……”（斯大林：“十月革命和中等阶层问题”）。这些话都是千真万确的。
    孙中山在十月革命后和列宁具体地建立了反帝国主义的革命友谊。这种友谊，对于中国人民的斗争是起了极大的作用的。
    毛泽东同志经常说到：正是伟大的列宁和他的伟大战友斯大林，经过了十月革命，给中国人传达了马克思主义。中国工人运动和马克思主义相结合，于是产生了伟大的中国共产党。在毛泽东同志的领导下，我们党接受了列宁和他的战友斯大林所共同创造的布尔塞维克的经验，把布尔塞维克主义当作自己工作的指南。
    列宁在“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”的文章中，曾经作过这种极深刻的观察：“没有高度的真正的民主主义的高涨，中国人民就不能真正解脱千百年来的奴隶制，因为这种高涨激起劳动群众并使之能够完成奇特的事业……”就是说，中国要实现真正的民主主义，推翻长期以来的奴役制度，必须经过真正的规模广大的人民革命。但是，正如历史所证明：中国资产阶级是不能够完成这样的历史任务的，这个历史任务乃是落在中国无产阶级的肩上。而中国无产阶级之所以能够领导人民革命，并胜利地完成解放中国的任务，就是因为中国无产阶级的政党是按照列宁斯大林的布尔塞维克原则而建立起来的，就是因为中国共产党的伟大领袖毛泽东同志正确地运用布尔塞维主义到中国来，并在中国的历史条件下光辉地发展了它。
    列宁的“帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段”、“国家与革命”、“两个策略”、“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”等等极其光辉灿烂的科学著作，三十年来武装了中国的革命者，武装了中国的人民。毛泽东同志经常教育我们：必须不断地从列宁这一切著作中吸取智慧而避免错误。这些著作给予中国共产党人和中国人民的启发，真是没有限量的。
    中国人民伟大的朋友和导师——列宁对于中国人民的伟大力量和伟大作用的估价，已经完全被历史所证明了。可惜列宁来不及看见这二十几年来中国人民的一切英雄事业。
    一九一三年五月间，列宁写道：
    “亚洲的觉醒和欧洲先进无产阶级夺取政权的斗争之开始，标志了在二十世纪初所揭开的一个全世界历史的新时代。”（列宁：“亚洲的觉醒”）
    过了十年，一九二三年三月间，也即无产阶级业已在俄国夺取了政权后有好几年了，列宁又这样写道：
    “归根到底，这个斗争的结局，将决定于以下这个事实，即俄国、印度、中国等等，构成了人口的绝大多数。而正是这个人口的大多数，在最近数年来，已经以非常的速度被卷入在争取他们自身解放的斗争中了。因此，在这一点上看起来，世界斗争的最终结果将是怎样的，实在不能有任何丝毫可以怀疑的地方了。在这种意义上说来，社会主义的最后胜利，已完全无条件地有保证了。”（列宁：“宁肯少些，但要好些”）
    全世界正是按照列宁的科学预见前进。当伟大的中国人民革命继续伟大的十月社会主义革命而取得胜利之后，帝国主义的完全灭亡，人民民主和社会主义在全世界的完全胜利，不是更加已成定局了吗？目前中国人民和朝鲜人民在朝鲜反侵略战争中的光荣胜利和美帝国主义的狼狈溃败，以及越南人民在反对法帝国主义的解放战争中的胜利……这等等事实，不是更加明显地描绘出帝国主义日暮途穷这样的图画了吗？
    列宁正是第一个在二十世纪初期号召和指导全世界被压迫人民勇敢地和胜利地向帝国主义进军的伟大导师。
    我们的导师——列宁永垂不朽！
