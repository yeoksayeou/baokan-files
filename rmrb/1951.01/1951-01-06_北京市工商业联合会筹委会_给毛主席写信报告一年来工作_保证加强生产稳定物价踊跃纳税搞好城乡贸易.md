Respected Chairman Mao:

Under your banner, having thrown off the shackles and plunder of imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, we industrialists and businessmen who have stood up are now greeting the victorious year of 1951 with unparalleled joy, together with the broad masses of the people of the whole country.

The past year of 1950 was truly a year of historical significance for us industrialists and businessmen in the capital and even the whole country. Because in this year, thanks to the correct financial and economic unification policies adopted by our Central People's Government, the malignant inflation of the past twelve years was stopped, and prices gradually stabilized, creating favorable conditions for the development of our industry and commerce. At the same time, a series of professional conferences were held to adjust and strengthen the relationship between public and private sectors and the relationship between production and sales, making our business better day by day, and now it is universally thriving. This should be attributed to your wise leadership and the vigorous support of the people's governments at all levels. In addition to our sincere gratitude, we would like to give you a brief report on our work over the past year.

In this year, we not only enthusiastically supported and implemented the government's various policies and measures, but also gloriously completed the following important tasks: (1) Overfulfilled the sales target of the first phase of the People's Victory Discount Bonds. (2) In order to rectify our ranks, strengthen our organization, and establish our new style, we carried out a general rectification of the old trade associations. We have now established preparatory committees for new associations in one hundred and twenty-six industries, and the rectification of the remaining ten industries will soon be completed. (3) During the major transformation of industry and commerce in April and May last year, in order to support industrial and commercial households that were temporarily encountering difficulties but were beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, we launched and organized public-private joint lending syndicates with the cooperation of the People's Bank, and carried out planned and focused lending. By the end of last year, the cumulative amount of loans reached 12.75 billion yuan. This not only played a certain supporting role for legitimate industrialists and businessmen, but also promoted their confidence and enthusiasm in business operations, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent improvement. In October last year, in order to develop urban-rural trade, we mobilized private firms to raise 10 billion yuan specifically for loans to industries related to urban-rural trade, and the work is still actively underway. (4) To relieve our compatriots in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Hebei, and Henan who suffered from floods, we raised a total of 23,000 sets of winter clothing. (5) In order to strengthen the unity of members and assist judicial organs in clearing up and resolving industrial and commercial disputes, we accepted a total of 215 industrial and commercial dispute cases under the entrustment and guidance of the People's Court, and a total of 190 cases have now been settled through agreement and mediation. (6) In order to oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and our neighboring country, Korea, after the joint declaration was issued by the various democratic parties in China, the industrial and commercial circles in the capital immediately gathered and unanimously resolved to express their warm support, and on the spot signed five patriotic covenants to support the front and consolidate the rear. Industrial and commercial circles in various places rose up to respond, dealing a head-on blow to the illusions that war peddlers and their running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, had about China's industrial and commercial circles. After the liberation of Pyongyang, we launched and organized a demonstration parade of 53,000 industrialists and businessmen on December 9th to oppose American imperialist aggression, clearly telling the imperialists: The current Chinese industrialists and businessmen have not only stood up, but also taken action. At the same time, we raised a large number of condolence bags, condolence letters, and 22,300 pairs of leather gloves to comfort the Chinese and Korean warriors who are bravely fighting the enemy in the freezing cold.

We now assure you that in the future, in addition to continuing to expand and deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, strengthen production, stabilize prices, enthusiastically pay taxes, improve urban-rural trade, and turn our covenants into concrete actions, we will also call on and organize all industrialists and businessmen in the capital to resolutely support the State Council's measures to control and investigate American property and freeze American deposits in order to smash the enemy's economic blockade, thoroughly eliminate the economic aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, and resolutely struggle to establish our self-reliant New Democratic economic system!

With highest respects!

And wishing you good health.
                                    Preparatory Committee of Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce

　　北京市工商业联合会筹委会
    给毛主席写信报告一年来工作
    保证加强生产稳定物价踊跃纳税搞好城乡贸易敬爱的毛主席：
    在您的旗帜之下，挣脱了帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的桎梏和掠夺，站起来了的我们工商业者，现在正以无比的欢欣，和全国人民大众一道，迎接着胜利的一九五一年。
    过去了的一九五○年，对于我们首都乃至全国工商业者来说，实在是富有历史性的意义的一年，因为在这一年中，由于我中央人民政府采取了正确的财经统一政策，停止了十二年来的恶性通货膨胀，使物价逐渐趋于稳定，为我们工商业的发展创造了有利的条件；同时又召开了一连串的专业会议，调整并加强了公私关系和产销关系，使我们的业务，一天比一天的好转起来，现在是普遍的欣欣向荣了。这应该归功于您的英明领导和各级人民政府的大力扶植。我们除了衷诚的感激之外，谨将我们一年来的工作，向您作一个简略的报告。
    在这一年中，我们不但热烈地拥护和执行了政府的各项施策，并且光荣地完成了下列几项重要任务：（一）超额完成了第一期人民胜利折实公债的推销任务。（二）为了整顿我们的队伍，强化我们的组织，树立我们新的作风，对于旧的同业公会，进行了普遍的整改工作，现在已经建立了一百二十六个行业的新的公会筹备委员会，剩下的十个行业的整改工作，不久也快完成了。（三）在去年四五月间工商业大转变的时期，我们为了扶持有利于国计民生而暂时遭遇困难的工商业户，在人民银行的协力之下，发动并组织了公私营联合放款银团，进行了有计划的有重点的贷放工作，截止去年年底，累计贷放款额共达一百二十七亿五千万元。这对于正当工商业者不但是起了一定的扶持作用，而且也促进了他们对于业务经营的信心和积极性，为后来的好转打下了有力的基础。去年十月我们为了开展城乡贸易，又发动了私营行庄集资一百亿元，专对有关城乡贸易的行业举办贷款，现下仍在积极进行工作中。（四）为了救济苏北、皖北、河北、河南遭受水灾的同胞，我们共计募集了寒衣二万三千套。（五）我们为了加强会员的团结与协助司法机关清理与解决工商业的纠纷，在人民法院的委托和指导之下，共计接受了二百一十五件工商业的纠纷案件，现在已经成立协议和调解完了的共计一百九十件。（六）为了反对美帝国主义侵略台湾和我们的邻邦朝鲜，在中国各民主党派发表联合宣言之后，我们首都工商界立即集会，一致决议，表示热烈拥护，当场签订了支援前线巩固后方的五项爱国公约，各地工商界纷起响应，使战争贩子及其走狗国民党反动派对中国工商界所存在的幻想，遭受了迎头的打击。在平壤解放之后，我们又于十二月九日发动和组织了五万三千工商业者反对美帝侵略的示威大游行，明白地告诉帝国主义者：现在的中国工商业家不但是站起来了，而且行动起来了。与此同时，我们募集了大批慰问袋、慰问信和二万二千三百付皮手套，以慰劳在冰天雪地奋勇杀敌的中朝勇士。
    我们现在向您保证：今后除了继续扩大和深入抗美援朝运动，加强生产，稳定物价，踊跃纳税，搞好城乡贸易，把我们的公约变成具体的行动外，并将号召和组织全首都工商业者，坚决地拥护政务院为粉碎敌人的经济封锁所颁布的管制清查美国财产、冻结美国存款的措施，彻底肃清美帝国主义在中国的经济侵略势力，树立我们自力更生的新民主主义经济体制而坚决奋斗！
    谨致崇高的敬礼！
    并祝身体健康。
                                    北京市工商业联合会筹备委员会
