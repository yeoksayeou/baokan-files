　　The Broad Masses of the British People Support Peace and Strive for Friendship with Us; "Committee for Peace with China" Launched with Assistance from Multiple Members of the British Labour and Conservative Parties
　　[Dispatch from this newspaper] According to the British "Worker's Daily," a gathering of over two thousand people in London on January 8th, with the assistance of seven British Members of Parliament, initiated the establishment of the "Committee for Peace with China." The report from the newspaper on January 9th is translated below:
　　A grand and enthusiastic gathering was held at Kingsway Hall, London, last night, at which the "Committee for Peace with China" was launched. The committee was established with the assistance of five Labour Members of Parliament, one Labour Member of the House of Lords, and one Conservative Member of Parliament.
　　The initial list of members includes Norman Bower, Conservative Member of Parliament for Harrow, Lord Stansgate, Labour Member of the House of Lords, and the following Labour Members of Parliament: Mr. Reginald Sorensen for Leyton, Mrs. C.S. Ganley for South Battersea, Mr. Donnelly for Pembroke, Mr. John Baston for North-West Walthamstow, and Mr. John Parker for Dagenham.
　　Kingsway Hall, capable of accommodating two thousand people, was filled fifteen minutes before the start of last night’s meeting, leaving hundreds standing outside.
　　Chairman Lord Stansgate strongly condemned the idea of an economic blockade against China, arguing that it could only lead to war.
　　He described the Chinese People’s Government as the best government China has had in many years and then pointed out that the long-suffering Chinese people felt their own security was threatened when MacArthur crossed the 38th parallel.
　　Prolonged applause erupted when Mr. Sorensen declared, "Never fight China."
　　No matter how much he hated communism, he also realized that communism could never be eliminated by fighting China.
　　Reverend Henry Carter spoke of the American "scorched earth policy" that was leveling Korea, and then said that he doubted whether humanity should reconsider the legitimate authority of the United Nations.
　　This statement drew cheers from the audience. He continued, "We must reverse the trend of today's foreign policy." At this point, cheers rose again.
　　Conservative MP Mr. Powell said that his trust in Anglo-American friendship was second to none. But this friendship must not be based on a master-slave relationship; it must be a two-way affair.
　　He declared: "I believe that America's Far East policy is absolutely harmful."
　　On the Korean issue, a lasting or proper solution would be impossible without China's assistance, and such assistance would not be obtained before China entered the United Nations.
　　Perhaps some might consider this "losing face," but "as long as world peace can be maintained, whose face is lost is not important."
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch] London message: Amidst the increasingly loud calls for peace from the broad masses of the British people, the Labour Party local organization in Stratford-upon-Avon on the River Avon, England, under the initiative of five Labour Members of Parliament, Silverman, Osborne, Yates, Langdon, and Hulme, has established the "Committee for Peace with China." In its founding declaration, the committee approved adherence to the Cairo Declaration regarding the Taiwan issue, demanded the admission of representatives of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations Security Council, opposed the expansion of the Korean War, and demanded a just resolution of the Korean issue and full cooperation within the United Nations with twelve Asian and Arab countries.

　　英国广大人民拥护和平争取与我友好
　  发起成立“对中国和平委员会”
　  英工党及保守党议员多人参加协助
    【本报讯】据英国工人日报消息：一月八日，在伦敦的一个两千多人的集会上，在英国七位议员的协助之下，发起成立“对中国和平委员会”。兹将该报一月九日的记载译志于下：
    伦敦金丝威大厦昨晚举行盛大而热烈的集会，会上发起了“对中国和平委员会”。该会在工党下议员五人、上议员一人和保守党下议员一人协助之下，成立起来。
    首批会员名单中有亚哈洛区的保守党下议员诺曼·波威耳，工党上议员斯坦斯盖特勋爵和下列几个工党下议员：雷吞区的雷其纳·梭伦生先生，南巴特希区的西·斯·甘来夫人，盆布鲁克区的唐诺来先生，北挪威支区的约翰·巴顿先生和达根汉区的约翰·派克先生。
    足以容纳二千人的金丝威大厦于昨晚开会前十五分钟，即告满座，以致有几百个人只能伫立场外。
    主席斯坦斯盖特勋爵严斥经济封锁中国的想法，他认为那只能导致战争。
    他叙述了中国人民政府是多年以来中国最好的政府，接着并指出：过去备尝艰苦的中国人民在麦克阿瑟越过三八线时，感到他们自己的安全受到了威胁。
    当梭伦生先生宣称“决不与中国作战”时，掌声经久不绝。
    不管他多么痛恨共产主义，他也认识到共产主义是永远不能因为与中国作战而消灭的。
    亨利·加特尔牧师讲述了正在夷平朝鲜的美国“焦土政策”，他跟着说：他怀疑人类是否应该再考虑一下联合国的正当职权。
    这句话引起了听众的欢呼。他接着说：“我们必须把今天外交政策的趋向倒转过来。”这时，欢呼随之再起。
    保守党议员波威耳先生说他，对于英美友谊的信任，并不亚于任何人。但是这种友谊决不能建立在主奴关系的基础上，它必须是双方面的事。
    他宣称：“我相信美国的远东政策是绝对有害的。”
    在朝鲜问题上，没有中国的协助，决不可能获致持久的或妥善的解决办法，而且在中国进入联合国之前，也是不会得到这种协助的。
    也许有人会认为这是“丢面子”，但是“只要能够保持世界和平，谁丢面子是没有什么要紧的”。
    【新华社二十九日讯】伦敦消息：在英国广大人民日益响亮的和平呼声中，英国亚冯河边斯特拉特福德的工党地方组织，在锡尔佛曼、奥斯本、叶芝、郎登、许尔默五名工党国会议员的发起之下，已成立了“对中国和平委员会”。该委员会在其成立宣言中赞成遵守开罗宣言关于台湾问题的决定，要求接纳中华人民共和国的代表进入联合国安全理事会，反对扩大朝鲜战争，并要求公正解决朝鲜问题及在联合国中与亚洲、阿拉伯十二个国家充分合作。
