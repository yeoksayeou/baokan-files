　　Medical and Health Workers Stand Up!
　　Yu Yiti, President of Beijing First Municipal Hospital

　　China's medical field has been deeply influenced by imperialist cultural aggression. In Western medicine, the so-called German school initially dominated. After the First World War, the Japanese, British, and American schools gained prominence. Later, American imperialists, seeing this method as "more beneficial than military flags," vigorously established medical schools, set up hospitals, and recruited students to study abroad. Within a few years, they surpassed others and became the dominant force. However, despite establishing many medical and nursing schools and hospitals, they never founded a single pharmaceutical school or a factory for manufacturing medical equipment. Therefore, Western medicine in China's medical field could only consume and not produce. It could only rely on the United States and could not be self-sufficient. This was the fatal flaw of China's medical field. From the beginning, China's medical field was crippled. In the past, when imperialists dumped large quantities of medicines and equipment into China, everyone turned a blind eye to this problem. Today, as the Chinese people have stood up and want to be self-sufficient, the lack of equipment and talent is keenly felt.

　　Initially, imperialists regarded medical undertakings as appendages of religion and treated healing as a side job for missionaries. They used the mask of charity to deceive the Chinese people. During the May Thirtieth Incident, when we went on strike and marched, our parents rebuked us, saying, "Although the imperialists are hateful, it is good that they run schools to educate the Chinese. We should not oppose them, but should thank them." This confused idea was very common before we refuted Austin's absurd remarks.

　　Western doctors in China's medical field, because of their direct contact with imperialists, have suffered more or less humiliation. Now, they are awakened. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, Beijing's medical workers were the first to organize volunteer surgical teams and set off for the front lines, greatly encouraging the frontline soldiers. It was only that there were too many applicants and too few people approved. The continuous applications from volunteers kept the administrative heads of various units busy with persuasion. The awakened medical workers, their hatred of American imperialism and their fervent patriotism, can be proved from here.

　　Simultaneously with the departure of the volunteer surgical teams, five medical organizations also held two training courses on war wound surgery and war wound first aid. These two training courses adopted the "little teacher" system, preparing to gradually expand, so that war wound surgery would expand from surgeons to general practitioners, and war wound first aid would expand from nurses and midwives to the general public and housewives.

　　The medical field has already done a lot of work in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Yesterday's (21st) demonstration and parade in the medical field was a further action to express their determination to resist America and aid Korea, and it was also an initiative of the medical and health circles in Beijing.

　　"Let the imperialists say that we can't do this or that!" China's medical and health workers have seen through the masks of American imperialists and are no longer deceived by the White Paper and the likes of Austin. The Chinese medical and health workers, who have stood up, have broken free from the shackles of imperialism and have free hands and feet. They will educate themselves, manufacture themselves, and create themselves in the fields of medicine and health, and establish an independent and self-reliant new Chinese medicine under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

　　医药卫生工作者站起来了！
    北京市立第一医院院长  余贻倜
    中国的医药界是受帝国主义文化侵略很深的。在西医方面，起初最占优势的是所谓德国派。第一次欧战后，占优势的是日本和英美派。后来美帝国主义者看着这方法“比军旗更有利”，大力地开办医学校，设医院，招收留学生。几年中就后来居上，独霸一方了。但是它虽然设立了许多医护学校和医院，却从来没有办过一所制药学校或制造医疗器械的工厂。所以中国的医药界中的西医，只能消费，不能生产。只有依靠美国，不能自立。这是中国医药界的致命伤。中国的医药界从最初起就是跛脚的。以前在帝国主义来中国大量倾销医药器材的年月里，大家对这个问题视若无睹。今天中国人民已经站立起来，要自给自足的时候，就感到设备和人才的缺乏了。
    最初，帝国主义者拿医药事业当宗教的附属物，拿治病当传教士的副业。他们以慈善的假面具来欺骗中国人民。“五卅”惨案，我们罢课游行的时候，我们的家长对我们的申斥是：“帝国主义者虽然可恨；但它办学校教育中国人是好的。我们不应该反对它，而应该感谢它。”这种糊涂的想法，在我们驳斥奥斯汀谰言以前，是很普遍的。
    中国的医药界中的西医，因为直接接触帝国主义者，他们都受了或多或少，或大或小的屈辱。现在，他们觉悟了，在抗美援朝运动中，北京的医务工作者首先组织志愿手术队，出发赴前线，大大地鼓励了前线战士。只是申请的人太多，而被批准的人数太少，志愿者的不断申请，使各单位行政负责人穷于说服。觉悟了的医药工作者，他们是怎样痛恨美帝与热诚的爱国，可以从这里得到证明。
    和志愿手术队出发的同时，五个医疗团体，又举办了战伤外科和战伤救护两个讲习班。这两个讲习班采取小先生制，准备逐步扩大，使战伤外科由外科医生扩大到一般医生，战伤救护由护士、助产士扩大到一般民众和家庭妇女。
    医药界在抗美援朝运动中已经作了许多工作，昨天（二十一日）医药界的示威大游行，是表达他们抗美援朝决心的进一步的行动，也是北京市医药卫生界的创举。
    “让帝国主义者说我们这也不行，那也不行吧”。中国的医药卫生工作者已经识破了美帝国主义者的假面具，不再受白皮书和奥斯汀之流的蒙蔽了。已经站立起来了的中国医药卫生工作者，摆脱了帝国主义的枷锁，有了自由的手足。他们将在医药卫生方面，自己教育，自己制造，自己创造，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下建立独立自主的新中国医学。
