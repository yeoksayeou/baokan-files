Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 11th. Newspapers in Czechoslovakia and Poland are enthusiastically hailing the glorious victory of the recapture of Seoul. The "People's Front," the organ of the Czechoslovakian Ministry of National Defense, published an article on the 9th entitled "Twenty-Four Victory Salvoes from Seoul," stating: The solemn victory salutes celebrating the victory in Seoul and Pyongyang are still echoing throughout the progressive world today, joyfully intertwined with the peace defenders' belief that imperialism is doomed to die. We salute General Kim Il-sung and the Korean people, and the soldiers of the volunteer forces from the People's China, and the admirable and invincible strength of the people of the East. We do not call it the "Far" East, because their hearts are so close to ours, because we all stand with them in a historic struggle against reactionary forces. The article continued: The salvoes celebrating the victory in Seoul express our joy and delight, just like the salvoes fired in Moscow during the Great Patriotic War celebrating the Soviet army's victory and announcing the defeat of fascism to the world. This thunderous sound echoing around the world not only expresses the joy after the victory in battle but also represents the accusations of millions of suffering people, men, women and children, and a warning to the warmongers in Wall Street and Washington. This salvo symbolizes the strength and heroism of socialist builders and represents the solemn and resolute voice of all peace-loving people. They are moving forward, forever fighting for the ideals of true democracy and humanity. The voice of progressive humanity from Pyongyang and Seoul says: Fight for peace, for the motherland, for socialism until complete victory.
    The Czechoslovakian trade union newspaper "Labor Daily" wrote in an editorial celebrating the liberation of Seoul: The days when the Korean people suffer are not far off. With the help of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army is today resolutely settling accounts with the American aggressors. They will drive the imperialist criminals out of the whole of Korea.
    The Polish United Workers' Party newspaper "People's Tribune" published the news of the liberation of Seoul in a prominent position on the first page on the 6th and published a commentary stating: The atrocities of the American aggressors have shown the world what they would do to all mankind. But their brutality is precisely an expression of their panic in the face of the heroic Korean people and the people of the whole world. These atrocities have not frustrated the fighting spirit of the Korean people, but only increased their hatred for the bloody executioners.

　　东欧各国庆祝汉城光复
    波、捷报纸欢呼朝中人民胜利
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】捷、波两国报纸热烈欢呼汉城光复的辉煌胜利。捷克斯洛伐克国防部机关报人民防线报九日发表题为“汉城传来的二十四响胜利的礼炮”的论文称：在汉城和平壤庄严响起的庆祝胜利的礼炮声，今天还在整个进步世界回响着，它与和平保卫者坚信帝国主义必定死亡的信念欢乐地交织在一起。我们向金日成将军和朝鲜人民致敬，向从人民中国来的志愿部队的战士致敬，向这个令人钦佩的不可征服的东方的人民力量致敬。我们不把它叫作“远”东，因为他们和我们的心靠得这样近，因为我们大家都和他们站在一道与反动势力作历史性的斗争。该文继称：庆祝汉城之捷的礼炮声，表现了我们的欢乐与愉快，正像莫斯科在伟大的爱国战争中施放的庆祝苏军胜利，和向全世界宣布法西斯主义失败的炮声一样。这种响彻全世界的隆隆炮声，不仅表现了战斗胜利后的欢乐，而且代表着千百万受苦难的人民和妇孺的控诉，和对华尔街及华盛顿的战争贩子们的警告。这一炮声象征着社会主义建设者的力量和英雄主义，代表着所有爱好和平人民的严肃与坚决的声音。他们向前迈进，永远为真正的民主和人道的理想而战斗。从平壤和汉城发出的进步人类的声音说：为和平、为祖国、为社会主义战斗到完全胜利。
    捷克斯洛伐克工会机关报劳动报在庆祝汉城解放的社论中写道：朝鲜人民不再受苦难的日子已经不远了。在中国人民志愿部队的援助下，朝鲜人民军今天坚决地和美国侵略军算了账。他们将把帝国主义罪犯赶出全朝鲜。
    波兰统一工人党机关报人民论坛报六日以第一版显著地位刊载了汉城解放的消息，并发表评论称：美国侵略者的兽行向全世界表明了他们会对全人类做些什么。但他们的残暴正是表示了他们在英勇的朝鲜人民和全世界人民面前的恐慌，这些兽行并未挫折朝鲜人民的斗志，而只有增加了他们对血腥刽子手的仇恨。
