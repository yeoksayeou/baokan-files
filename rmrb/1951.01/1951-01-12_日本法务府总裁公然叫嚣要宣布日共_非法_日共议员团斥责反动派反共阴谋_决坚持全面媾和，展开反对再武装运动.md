Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: The Japanese Yoshida reactionary government has once again clamored to declare the Japanese Communist Party "illegal," attempting to further suppress Japanese peace and democratic forces. The Yoshida government's Justice Minister, Takeo Ohashi, in an outrageous slanderous speech against the Japanese Communist Party in Osaka on the 5th, openly claimed: "The Japanese government is considering steps to declare this red organization (referring to the Japanese Communist Party) illegal." He brazenly disregarded the Potsdam Declaration's stipulation that the Japanese government must foster democratic forces, and shamelessly said: "The Communist Party is no longer qualified to receive legal protection."
　　Even before the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, the American and Japanese reactionaries had launched a fierce attack on the Japanese Communist Party, the defender of peace, democracy, and independence in Japan. MacArthur and Shigeru Yoshida, in early May of last year, successively issued statements declaring the Japanese Communist Party "illegal." Starting from June 6th, they illegally "purged" all twenty-four members of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee, headed by Kyuichi Tokuda, as well as other Japanese Communist Party leaders and Diet members, and closed down the Japanese Communist Party's central organ "Akahata" (Red Flag), local newspapers, and more than 1,200 other democratic newspapers. However, these atrocities by the American and Japanese reactionaries only strengthened the fighting will of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people. And this arrogant clamor by Takeo Ohashi exposes the deep fear of the American and Japanese reactionaries towards the growing Japanese peace and democratic forces.

Xinhua News Agency, January 10th, Tokyo Dispatch: Jirokazu Hosokawa, leader of the Japanese Communist Party Diet members, issued a statement on the 9th denouncing Justice Minister Takeo Ohashi's clamor about declaring the Japanese Communist Party "illegal." The statement pointed out that, simultaneously with the "purge" of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee members in June last year, the reactionaries were rapidly carrying out the work of "illegalizing" the Japanese Communist Party. The reactionaries, seeing that the existence of the Japanese Communist Party, which advocates comprehensive peace and opposes Japanese rearmament, hindered the implementation of their plans, have now decided to accelerate the "illegalization" of the Japanese Communist Party in preparation for the "United Nations forces" soon retreating from Korea to Japan. The statement resolutely stated: We will never succumb to any suppression and are determined to fight against the "illegalization" conspiracy through a comprehensive peace and an anti-rearmament movement.

　　日本法务府总裁公然叫嚣要宣布日共“非法”
    日共议员团斥责反动派反共阴谋
    决坚持全面媾和，展开反对再武装运动
    【新华社十日讯】日本吉田反动政府再次叫嚣要宣布日本共产党为“非法”，企图进一步打击日本和平民主势力。吉田政府法务府总裁大桥武夫于五日在大阪发表无耻污蔑日共的谈话时，公然声称：“日本政府正在考虑宣布这个赤色组织（按指日共）为非法的步骤”。他悍然蔑视波茨坦公告关于日本政府必须扶助民主势力的规定，横蛮无耻地说：“共产党已没有资格再受合法的保护”。
    早在美国发动侵略朝鲜战争以前，美、日反动派就对日本和平、民主与独立的保卫者——日本共产党发动凶恶的进攻。麦克阿瑟与吉田茂去年五月初即曾相继发表要宣布日共为“非法”的声明。自六月六日起，他们非法“整肃”了以德田球一为首的全体二十四名日共中央委员及其他日共领袖与国会议员，封闭了日共中央机关报“赤旗报”、地方机关报及其他民主报纸一千二百余家。但美、日反动派这些暴行，只是加强了日共和日本人民的斗争意志。而大桥武夫这一狂妄叫嚣，正暴露出美、日反动派对日益壮大的日本和平民主力量的深刻恐惧。
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：日本共产党国会议员团团长细川嘉六于九日发表声明，斥责吉田政府法务府总裁大桥武夫关于要宣布日共为“非法”的叫嚣。声明指出：与去年六月间“整肃”日共中央委员的同时，反动派就在迅速进行日共“非法化”的工作。反动派鉴于主张全面媾和与反对日本再武装的日共的存在，阻碍了它们的计划的实行，因此现在决心加速使日共“非法化”，为即将从朝鲜退却到日本的“联合国部队”预作准备。声明坚决地说：我们决不屈服于任何镇压，决心通过全面媾和，反对再武装运动，与“非法化”阴谋进行斗争。
