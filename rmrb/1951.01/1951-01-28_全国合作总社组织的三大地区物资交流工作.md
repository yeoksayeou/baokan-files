　　The National Cooperatives Organize Material Exchange Work in Three Major Regions
    Liang Yao
    In order to systematically and purposefully develop procurement and trade within the cooperative system, facilitate the exchange of local products, and effectively serve lower-level cooperatives and members, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives organized material exchange operations among the North China, Northeast, and East China regions at the end of November 1950.

    This exchange was carried out under the unified plan and leadership of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. The Northeast District Cooperative Marketing Cooperative supplied 50,000 tons of soybeans, 130,000 tons of soybean cakes, 40,000 tons of sorghum, and 80,000 tons of corn, totaling 300,000 tons, to North China and East China. In return, it received 420,000 bolts of coarse cloth, 2,000,000 jin of ginned cotton, 100,000 bolts of homespun cloth, 700,000 reed mats, as well as red dates, smoked dates, persimmon cakes, and Sichuan peppercorns from the North China Cooperative, and 230,000 bolts of coarse cloth, 2,000,000 bamboo seedlings, as well as tea, brown sugar, cool mats, socks, vests, blended thread, towels, and sneakers from the East China Cooperative. This exchange aimed to meet the urgent needs of Northeast members to sell grain for cloth and cotton, and of members in the interior to exchange agricultural and handicraft products for grain and fertilizer. Calculated at the agreed-upon prices, the total value of the exchange reached over 640 billion yuan.

    This kind of planned and organized material exchange is an important method to simplify the commodity circulation process and reduce cargo costs. In the past, material exchange work had also been conducted between cooperatives in large administrative regions, but it was relatively sporadic, not only small in quantity but also lacking unified organization and planning. This material exchange was larger and more complex than previous ones in terms of quantity, time, region, and types of goods. Without a high degree of organizational work and careful planning, it would be difficult to complete successfully.

    In organizing this material exchange among the three major regions, the first step was to clarify that this was not only a matter of solving the needs of members in different regions and developing an organized cooperative trade network, but also of great significance in supporting national financial and price stability.

    During the signing of the exchange agreement, some regions did not have a sufficiently accurate understanding of the actual situation and were not sure about the production and sales quantities and prices of members' products; others showed capitalist management ideas that did not start from the needs of members but entirely from the needs of the region. In order to correct the business line of the cooperatives and lay a good foundation for the exchange of materials, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives decided: (1) The principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit must be adhered to, with prices kept low and goods kept high in quality. (2) The policy of upper-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives serving members must be strictly implemented. The determination of the above two principles ensured the smooth progress of this exchange.

    Second, pricing principles were set, and fixed-quota profits were implemented. The general principle of this material exchange was to minimize commodity circulation links, reduce regional price differences, and implement cost accounting to correct the profit-seeking mentality and oppose the concept of charity. Therefore, the principles of procurement and sales prices were established.

    (1) The purchase of products should be based on the prices set by the state. If the state purchase price is lower than the market price, purchases should be made according to the market price; conversely, if the state price is higher than the market price, but the state does not purchase in large quantities or has stopped purchasing, creating a situation where there is a price but no market, purchases can be made slightly above the market price. If there is no certainty about the price at the sales destination, purchases can be made based on the price at the production location. (2) The sale of goods by cooperatives should generally be lower than the market price; it can also be lower than or the same as the state price, but it must not be higher than the market price. (3) In the situation where prices have not been fully stabilized, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, based on the state's price policy and combined with the actual situation in various places, will uniformly set the exchange ratio of cloth and grain, and cotton and grain between production and sales areas, stipulating that cooperatives should adjust accordingly when the state adjusts the cotton and grain exchange ratio; when price fluctuations do not exceed 5%, the major regions can control it themselves, and when it exceeds this and affects the exchange ratio, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives will be responsible for adjusting and controlling it.

    In order to overcome the profit-seeking mentality and avoid competition for profits between upper and lower levels, it was stipulated that the net profit of each level of cooperative should not exceed 3% of the fixed-quota profit. It was also stipulated that when each level of cooperative above the county level distributes fixed-quota profits, it should follow the principle of less for the upper level and more for the lower level, less for those who organize or transfer goods, and more for those who execute the work. At the same time, in order to give members as much benefit as possible, if there is still a surplus after deducting damage, transportation, packaging, taxes, interest, other expenses, and fixed-quota profit from the regional price difference, the purchase price for members in the production area can be appropriately increased, and the selling price to members in the sales area can be reduced. However, if the regional price difference is excessively large due to the state's price policy, resulting in excess profits, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives will control these profits and use them to compensate for unexpected losses, adjust for exchange ratio losses, and for the basic construction of national cooperatives.

    Third, standard fixed rates were determined, and the economic accounting system was implemented. In order to promote the rationalization of the management of cooperatives at all levels, fixed rates for the management expenses and business expenses of each cooperative were stipulated; in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds, each cooperative was required to accelerate the turnover of funds and commodities, with funds turning over once a month and commodities turning over twice a month, and strict cost accounting was implemented. Reasonable standards were set for grassroots cooperative fees, operating expenses, packaging fees, escort fees, loading fees, and loss rates, to serve as benchmarks for future work summaries.

    In terms of reducing commodity circulation links, in order to overcome the shortcomings of multiple intermediaries increasing costs, it was stipulated that general purchases and sales should be carried out in two steps (one for purchase and concentration, one for receiving and distributing), and processed goods should be carried out in three steps.

    In addition, it was stipulated that specifications and quality must be guaranteed, goods must be delivered according to samples, and only improvement was allowed, not reduction.

    Fourth, organizational and planning aspects in business were emphasized: (1) In order to effectively organize the manpower, financial resources, and material resources of cooperatives at all levels to complete this task, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and the major regional federations vigorously developed the contract system, signing exchange contracts, processing and transportation contracts, pre-purchase and pre-exchange contracts, cash purchase and cash sale contracts, etc., with lower-level cooperatives. Various small contracts were used to ensure the implementation of large contracts, and a series of problems in the exchange were organized and resolved through contracts. (2) Financial plans, plans for exchanging cotton for cloth, and plans for the collection, distribution, and transportation of goods were formulated. With the support of the banking, railway, and trade departments, the goal was to achieve timely turnover and supply of funds. (3) On the issue of transportation, cooperatives at all levels were required to submit transportation plans in a timely manner, and they were required to make specific deployment, distribution, and storage plans in detail and accurately according to the starting point, delivery point, and delivery time, requiring that goods be loaded as soon as the train arrives, and goods be unloaded as soon as they arrive, only allowing goods to wait for the train, and not allowing the train to wait for the goods.

    In order to ensure the thorough implementation of the above regulations and the realization of the plan, inspection systems, reporting systems, reward and punishment systems, and market information notification systems were established.

    The material exchange work in the three major regions has been underway for a month. During this period, due to the establishment of the above-mentioned necessary systems and the formulation and implementation of many important measures, the cooperative has taken a step forward in the operational management of its business, the organization of work at all levels, and the accuracy of planning. It has laid the foundation for carrying out the cooperative's national material exchange business in the future.

    As of the end of last year, North China completed its full-month plan, Northeast completed 75% of its full-month plan, and East China completed 220% of its full-month plan. In the material exchange, the price of cloth supplied to members by the Northeast averaged 7.15% lower than the state price; the price of ginned cotton averaged 9.61% lower than the state price. The price of corn supplied to members in the interior averaged 6.66% lower than the state price, and sorghum was 5.93% lower than the state price. This enabled members to truly receive material benefits.

    In the course of the exchange business, the following problems have also occurred and should be noted and improved by cooperatives at all levels.

    The first is the issue of specifications and quality. Taking cotton and grain as examples, when the exchange agreement was signed, it only stipulated that the quality of cotton should be lint, with seven-eighths medium-grade cotton as the pricing standard. However, it has now been found that such a general regulation makes it impossible to conduct inspections in the production area and impossible to price in the sales area. The Northeast's grain only stipulated that the specifications and quality should be medium quality or above, but the grain quality in southern Manchuria and northern Manchuria in the Northeast region is different. The quality in southern Manchuria is better, and the quality in northern Manchuria is worse. Moreover, Beijing and Tianjin need Grade B grain, but the Northeast lacks this Grade B grain and has transported Grade C grain instead, so members are unwilling to eat it. These problems illustrate that before the business is carried out, it is impossible to rely on the estimates of cadres alone and be crude. It is necessary to conduct thorough surveys and statistics work with lower-level cooperatives and members to overcome this shortcoming.

    The second is the issue of changing transportation plans. Because the upper-level cooperatives lack an in-depth and systematic understanding of the situation of the lower-level cooperatives, the unloading points in some areas are planned by the upper-level cooperatives, and some lower-level cooperatives lack planning, resulting in frequent changes and repeated alterations. On the other hand, the difficulty in allocating train cars has also affected the completion of the Northeast region's original transportation plan.

    Third, the standard expenses stipulated in the agreement are generally higher than the actual expenses of each cooperative, which shows that there was a lack of practical experience when the original fixed-quota and fixed-rate standards were set; but it also shows that it is precisely because of the formulation of these indicators that cooperatives have been prompted to strengthen accounting work.

    The material exchange in the three major regions has provided many new experiences and established many new material exchange systems for the cooperative's procurement and trade work. In the future, we should strengthen the cooperative's management, continuously overcome shortcomings, and summarize experience in a timely manner, in order to continue to develop the cooperative's material exchange work and give play to the role that the cooperative economy should play.

　　全国合作总社组织的三大地区物资交流工作
    梁耀
    中华全国合作社联合总社为了有组织有计划地开展合作社系统的采购与贸易工作，畅通土产的交流，借以有效地为下级社服务和为社员服务，于一九五○年十一月底，组织华北、东北、华东三大地区进行物资交换业务。
    这一交换业务，在全国合作总社统一计划和领导下，由东北区合作社运销社员生产的大豆五万吨，豆饼十三万吨，红粮四万吨，玉米八万吨，共计三十万吨，供给华北和华东；并换回华北区合作社的大布四十二万匹、皮棉二百万斤、土布十万匹、苇席七十万片，及红枣、熏枣、柿饼、花椒等产品，和华东区合作社的大布二十三万匹、竹苗二百万斤及茶叶、红糖、凉席、袜子、背心、合股线、毛巾、球鞋等产品，以满足东北社员急于卖粮换得布棉，及关内社员以农产品和手工产品换得粮食和肥料的需要。按照协议规定价格计算，其交换总值达六千四百余亿元。
    这种有计划有组织的物资交换，是简化商品流通的过程，降低货物成本的重要方法。过去大行政区合作社之间，也曾进行过物资交换工作，但比较零星，不仅数量小，而且缺乏统一的组织性和计划性。这次物资交换在数量上、时间上、地区上、货品种类上，均比以往规模大而复杂，没有高度的组织工作和周密计划，是难以胜利完成的。
    在这次组织三大地区物资交换中，首先，从思想上明确了这不仅是解决地区间社员需要，发展了有组织的合作社贸易网，而且在配合国家稳定金融物价上，也有极大的意义。
    在签订交换协议中，有的地区对实际情况调查了解不够确切，对社员产品的产销数量和价格不敢肯定；有的则表现不从社员需要出发而完全从地区需要出发的资本主义的经营思想。为了端正合作社的业务路线，并打下交换物资的良好基础，合作总社曾决定：（一）必须本互助两利的原则，价格要低，货品要好。（二）严格贯彻上级社为下级社服务、基层社为社员服务的方针。上述两个原则的确定，保证了这次交换业务的顺利进行。
    第二、规定价格原则，施行定额利润。这次物资交换的总原则是，尽量减少商品流通环节，缩小地区价格差额，及实行成本核算，纠正营利思想，反对恩赐观点。因而规定了采购与推销价格的原则。
    （一）采购产品基本上应根据国家规定价格，如国家收购牌价低于市价，则在依照市价的原则下，进行收购；反之，如在国家牌价高于市价，实际又不大量收购或已停购、形成有行无市的情况下，则可稍高于市价进行收购。倘若对销地价格无把握时，可以根据产地价格进行收购。（二）各社销售物品一般应低于市价；亦可低于国营牌价，或与国营牌价相同，但不得高过市价。（三）在物价尚未全面稳定情况下，由全国合作总社根据国家价格政策，结合各地实际情况，统一规定产地与销地的布粮、棉粮交换比价，并规定：国家调整棉粮交换比价时，合作社亦随之调整；在物价涨落不超过百分之五的原则下，由各大区自行掌握，超过并影响交换比价时，则由全国合作总社负责调整掌握。
    为了克服营利思想，避免上下级社交相争利，规定了各级联社的纯利最高不超过百分之三的定额利润。并规定县以上各级社分配定额利润时，应根据上级少下级多，组织或转手的少分，执行者多分的原则。同时为尽力给予社员实惠，在地区差价减去伤耗、运输、包装、税收、利息、其他开支和定额利润后，仍有余裕时，则可适当地提高对产地社员的收购价格，和降低对销地社员的出售价格。但如由于国家价格政策所造成过大的地区差价，因而形成的超额利润，则由全国合作总社掌握，作为弥补意外损失，调整比价损失，及全国合作社的基本建设之用。
    第三、确定标准定率，贯彻经济核算制。为促进各级社经营管理的合理化，规定了各社管理费用，及业务费用的开支定率；为解决资金不足的困难，要求各社加速资金和商品的周转，规定资金周转每月一次，商品周转每月两次，并严格施行成本核算，对基层社手续费、经营费、包装费、押运费、装车费、损耗率等方面，均规定了合理标准，以作为将来总结工作的标志。
    在减少商品流转环节方面，为克服经手多加大成本的缺点，规定了一般的收购与推销，作到两次经手（收购集中一次，接货分发一次），加工的货物作到三次经手。
    此外，并作出必须保证规格质量，按样品交货，只许提高、不准降低的规定。
    第四、强调业务上的组织性和计划性：（一）为了有效地组织各级社的人力、财力和物力来完成这一任务，全国合作总社及各大区总社大力开展了合同制度，分别与下级社签订了交换合同、加工运输合同、预购预换合同、现购现销合同等等。以各种小合同来保证大合同的执行，把交换中一系列的问题，都通过合同组织起来进行了解决。（二）制订财务计划，调集棉花换布计划，货物集散运输计划。并在银行、铁道、贸易等部门的扶助下，以达到资金周转供应及时的要求。（三）在运输问题上要求各级社及时地提出运输计划，并要求细致地精确地按照起运点、交货点、交货时间，作出具体的调动、分发、保管计划，要求做到车到装车，货到卸货，只许货等车，不许车等货。
    为保证以上各种规定的彻底执行和计划的实现，并建立了检查制度、报告制度、奖惩制度和商情通报制度。
    三大地区的物资交换工作，进行已有一个月，在这期间由于以上各种必要制度的建立，许多重要办法的规定和执行，已使合作社在业务的经营管理上，逐级的组织工作及计划的精确性上提高了一步。并为开展今后合作社的全国性的物资交换业务，奠定了基础。
    截至去年年底，华北完成全月计划，东北完成全月计划的百分之七十五，华东完成全月计划的百分之二百二十。在物资交换中，东北供给社员布匹，其价格平均低于国营牌价百分之七点一五；皮棉平均低于国营牌价百分之九点六一。关内供给社员玉米，其价格平均低于国营牌价百分之六点六六，红粮低于国营牌价百分之五点九三。这样便使社员真正得到了物质实惠。
    在交换业务的进行中，也发生了下列问题，应引起各级社的注意与改进。
    首先是规格质量问题。以棉花和粮食来说，在订立交换协议时，仅规定棉花质量为絮花，以八分之七中级棉为计价标准，但目前已发现这样的笼统规定，在产地无从进行检查，在销地亦无法定价。东北的粮食仅规定规格质量为中等质量以上，但东北区南满与北满的粮食质量各有不同，南满质量好，北满质量次，并且京、津两市所需要的是乙等粮食，而东北却缺乏这种乙等粮，却运来了丙等粮，以致社员不愿吃。这些问题说明了在业务进行之先，不能粗枝大叶地仅由干部的估计出发，必须向下级社和社员切实地进行调查统计工作，才能克服这一缺点。
    其次是变更运输计划问题。由于上级社对下级社情况缺乏深入系统的了解，有些地区的卸货点由上级社代为计划，有的下级社计划性不够，以致朝令夕改，屡次变更。另一方面由于车皮调拨的困难，也影响了东北区原定运输计划的完成。
    第三，在协议中所规定的开支标准，一般都较各社实际开支率为高，这说明原来规定定额定率标准时缺乏实际经验；但也说明了正由于这些指标的规定，才促使合作社加强了核算工作。
    三大地区的物资交换，给合作社的采购和贸易工作，提供了许多新的经验，和建立着许多新的物资交换制度，今后应加强合作社的经营管理，不断克服缺点，及时总结经验，以期继续开展合作社的物资交流工作，发挥合作经济应起的作用。
