　　Introducing the Zhang Huaiyu Group
　　Martin

　　The production competition in the Jinan Railway Factory, which has been going on for more than a hundred days, has recently become even more intense.

　　The factory has seen nearly five thousand new production records in over a hundred days. Such great achievements were created by countless model figures. Zhang Huaiyu, a young worker in the foundry, is one of the outstanding figures known throughout the factory, and his group is also an outstanding one.

　　The achievements Zhang Huaiyu has made in this movement, judging solely from the production figures, are already astonishing enough: In the one hundred and five days from September 15th to the end of December, he continuously created nine new records. The production of B-type brake shoes increased from 15 boxes in a standard working time of eight hours to 160 boxes, a tenfold increase, and the quality of the finished products has also improved significantly, basically eliminating defective products. Not only that, but under his unity and help, the production of the entire group has also increased dramatically: the whole group has created 30 new records, Zhang Naiyu created 4 times, the group leader Zhang Zhenru created 5 times, and the production figures have all caught up with Zhang Huaiyu's 160 boxes. Wang Fuxue, Zhu Deji, and Yang Chunfa also created 4 new records each, and the production figures also increased from 15 boxes to 65 boxes.

　　To make such great achievements, there are many obstacles and difficulties. Zhang Huaiyu overcame these obstacles and difficulties with his high patriotic enthusiasm and wisdom.

　　When the factory launched the "Create New Records" campaign on September 15th last year, he was determined to overcome all difficulties and make some achievements to welcome the National Day. The next day, as expected, under his intensified efforts, he created the first new record, increasing the daily production of B-type brake shoes from 15 boxes to 24 boxes. This record, while bringing him confidence and joy, also brought him unpleasant events, because his record was created too quickly, and some people whose thinking was not progressing quickly not only did not use his achievements to encourage themselves to move forward, but instead aroused jealousy and even threatened him, not allowing him to create higher records. This was undoubtedly a significant blow to him, but after repeated ideological struggles and encouragement from the Party and the trade union, he finally strengthened his confidence. He believed that the initial difficulties were unavoidable, and as long as he worked hard and continuously improved production to influence and help those whose thinking was not progressing quickly, he would definitely be able to drive them forward. Under such ideological guidance, he also tried to improve the operating methods, working tirelessly, and finally, on the eve of National Day, he continuously created five new records, and the production volume surged to 50 boxes per day, and won the red flag, and received bonuses and encouragement from the higher authorities, which improved his production enthusiasm and confidence, and no one threatened him anymore. At this time, the whole factory also saw more than 600 new records in half a month.

　　In early December last year, after studying current affairs, all the factory workers launched a patriotic production competition to resist the US and aid Korea. He realized that to exert greater power and make greater achievements in this movement, he must improve the current working environment. Therefore, he requested the higher authorities to transfer him to the second group specializing in brake shoes, so as to bring his experience to the second group and be able to obtain assistance from the second group in production, and exert collective strength.

　　At the beginning of his transfer to the second group, he found that the group's production was not improving quickly, and some individuals were still jealous of him. Based on this situation, he immediately carried out unity work. In order to move them with practical actions, he sifted the sand and arranged the tools properly before each work; during work, he taught them all his experience in creating new records. For example, originally the sand mold was rammed twice, now it is changed to ramming it once with force; in the past, air holes were punched in the sand mold after it was made, now air holes are not punched, which can greatly save time, and the product quality is still qualified. At the same time, he personally helped everyone, cared about everyone's life, and often talked with Zhang Naiyu, a young worker in the group, to enlighten him. In this way, he first united Zhang Naiyu and launched a challenge with him. Since then, because of his kind help and warm concern for the workers, he deeply moved the group leader Zhang Zhenru and the workers Wang Fuxue, Zhu Deji, and Yang Chunfa, and a new situation appeared in the whole group: helping each other, encouraging each other, and labor enthusiasm was also exerted on this basis, and the production figures increased rapidly. Zhang Huaiyu's daily production of brake shoes reached 96 boxes, and Zhang Naiyu also reached this number, so they both received awards from the leaders of the railway bureau and commendations from the Railway Work Committee of the Communist Youth League. Zhang Zhenru and the other four also achieved a record of 65 boxes per day.

　　However, not long after achieving this result, news came that Wang Changhua, a young worker at the Jiulonggang Railway Factory, had created a record of 122 boxes of B-type brake shoes per day. This brought encouragement to their group, especially to Zhang Huaiyu, but it also made them very anxious. However, Zhang Huaiyu's high patriotic enthusiasm continued to inspire his confidence. He thought: Since many difficulties and obstacles have been overcome in the past two months, and production has increased sixfold, and Wang Changhua is also an individual, if he can create it, so can I. Under this firm will, he began to continue his efforts. However, since the record of 96 boxes had just been reached and the technique was not yet proficient, it was impossible to improve it immediately. Later, at the suggestion of the worker Yang Zhihai, he and the group workers studied and initially improved the tools, so that the output reached 103 boxes, but it was still far from Wang Changhua's record. At this time, the group that he personally united and promoted, especially Zhang Naiyu, had truly become his closest partner. Everyone saw that he was very worried, so they used various methods to comfort and encourage him, and helped him study and improve the tools. In this way, after several days of painstaking research, he finally drew the drawings with the help of Wang Wenzhao, the wooden mold supervisor, and made a new wooden mold with the help of the wooden mold workers, and finally created a national unprecedented record of 160 boxes of B-type brake shoes per day.

　　介绍张怀玉小组
    马丁
    已经开展了一百多天生产竞赛的济南铁路工厂，近来竞赛的热潮是越发炽烈了。
    该厂在一百多天中出现了近五千件新的生产的纪录数字。这样的巨大成绩，是无数模范人物创造的。铸工场的青年工人张怀玉，就是名闻全厂的杰出人物之一，他的那个小组，也是一个出色的小组。
    张怀玉在这个运动里所作出的成绩，单从生产数字上来看，已足够惊人了：从九月十五日到十二月底的一百零五天中，连续创造了九次新纪录，乙型闸瓦由标准工时八小时做十五箱提高到一百六十箱，足足提高十倍，并且成品质量也有显著提高，基本上已经消灭了废品。不仅如此，在他团结帮助下，使全小组的生产也飞跃提高：全组共创造了三十次新纪录，张乃玉创造了四次，组长张振儒创造了五次，生产数字都跟上了张怀玉的一百六十箱，王福学、朱德基、杨春发三人，也各人创造了四次新纪录，生产数字也从十五箱提高到六十五箱。
    要做出这样巨大的成绩，是存在着不少障碍与困难的。张怀玉就以他高度的爱国热情与智慧，克服了这些障碍与困难。
    去年九月十五日全厂开展创造新纪录运动时，他就下定了决心：非要克服一切困难，做出些成绩来迎接国庆不可。第二天，果然在他加紧努力下，创造了第一次新纪录，由过去日做乙型闸瓦十五箱提高到二十四箱。这一纪录，虽然给他带来了信心欢慰，但也给他惹来了不快的事件，因为他的纪录创造得太快了，有个别思想进步不快的人不但没有把他的成绩用以鼓励自己前进，反而引起了嫉妒，甚至威胁他，不容他创造更高的纪录。这对他无疑是一个不轻的打击，但经他三番五次的思想斗争以及党与工会的鼓励，终于坚定了自己的信心。他认为初时的困难是免不掉的，只要自己努力奋斗，不断地提高生产去影响和帮助思想进步不快的人，一定也能带动他们前进的。在这样的思想指导下，他又设法改进操作方法，未稍间歇地努力，终于在国庆前夕，连续创出了五次新纪录，生产量突飞猛进，达到了日造五十箱的数字，并且夺得了红旗，获得了上级的奖金与鼓励，提高了自己的生产热情与信心，同时也再没有人对他威胁了。这时，全厂也在半月内涌出了六百余件新纪录。
    去年十二月初，全厂职工通过时事学习后，抗美援朝的爱国主义生产竞赛澎湃地开展起来。他认识到要在这个运动中，发挥更大的力量，做出更大的成绩，必须改善目前的工作环境，因此他请求上级把他调到专门做闸瓦的第二组去，以便把自己的经验带给第二组，并可借以获得第二组在生产中的协助，发挥集体的力量。
    调到第二组之初，他发现这个组生产提高得不快，并且有个别人还对他嫉妒。根据这一情况，他立即进行了团结工作。为了以实际行动来感动他们，每次工作以前他就把沙筛好，把工具按排妥当；在工作时，将自己创造新纪录的经验全盘教给他们。如原先做沙模时砸沙两遍，现改为用力砸一遍；以前沙模做成后扎气眼，现在不扎气眼，这样可以大大地节省时间，产品质量也仍合格。同时并亲手帮助大家，关心大家的生活，并经常与同组青工张乃玉谈话，启发他，这样，首先团结了张乃玉，并与他展开了挑战。此后，由于他对工友们这种善意的帮助，热情的关切，深深地感动了组长张振儒与工人王福学、朱德基、杨春发，整个组出现了新的局面：互相帮助，互相鼓励，劳动热情也在这个基础上发挥出来，生产数字飞快地提高。张怀玉日造闸瓦数字达到九十六箱，张乃玉也达到此数，因此他们两人同时获得路局首长的奖励与青年团铁路工委会的通令表扬。张振儒他们四人亦达到了日造六十五箱的纪录。
    但是达到这一成绩不久，传来了九龙岗铁路工厂青工汪长华日造乙型闸瓦一百二十二箱的纪录的消息，这对他们这个组，特别是张怀玉，虽然带来了鼓舞作用，但也使他们非常着急。但是张怀玉的高度爱国热忱，继续鼓舞着他的信心，他想：既然两个月来已经克服了不少困难与障碍，生产已经提高了六倍，况且汪长华也是一个人，他能创造我也能创造。就在这坚决意志下，又开始继续努力。但由于九十六箱的纪录刚刚达到，手法尚不够熟练，要立即提高很不可能。后经工人杨志海的提议，他与小组工人研究，初次改进了工具，使产量达到了一百零三箱，但与汪长华的纪录比较，相差尚远。这时，经他亲自团结推动起来的小组，特别是张乃玉，已真正成为他最亲密的伙伴，大家看他很发愁，就用各种方法去安慰他鼓励他，并帮助他研究改进工具。这样，经过数天苦心钻研，终于在木型监工王文照的帮助下画出了图样，又经木型工人帮助做出了新的木型，终于创造了日造乙型闸瓦一百六十箱的全国空前纪录。
