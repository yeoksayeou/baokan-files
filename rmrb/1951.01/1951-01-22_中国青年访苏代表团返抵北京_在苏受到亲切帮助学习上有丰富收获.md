　　The Chinese Youth Delegation Returns to Beijing
    Received Warm Assistance in the Soviet Union, Rich Gains in Study

    [Reported by this newspaper] A portion of the Chinese Youth Delegation to the Soviet Union, headed by Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, arrived back in Beijing at 4:00 PM on January 20th.

    The delegation departed for the Soviet Union on October 20th of last year. The delegation consisted of over fifty members, including youth workers and young combat heroes such as Zhang Ming, Zhao Xingyuan, Guo Junqing, labor models Tian Guiying, Liang Jun, etc. The delegation visited the solemn city of Moscow, the heroic city of Leningrad, the ancient city of Kiev, the coal mining center of Donbas, the famous Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, and the beautiful Crimea (currently, a portion of the delegation is visiting Stalingrad, Georgia); visited hundreds of factories, schools, and rural villages; and held discussions with leaders of the Soviet Komsomol Central Committee, local Komsomol organizations, and relevant departments to study the Soviet Communist Youth League's experience in propaganda, education, and organization work among workers, farmers, students, children, and the armed forces. Thanks to the brotherly assistance of the Soviet people, especially the Soviet youth, the delegation's mission was successfully completed.

    During its visit to the Soviet Union for over two months, the delegation received a warm welcome and cordial reception from the Soviet people. The news of the victories achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the heroic battles in Korea further aroused the Soviet people's love for China. The delegation was also deeply moved by the genuine friendship of the Soviet youth towards the Chinese youth. In Irkutsk, a Soviet youth said emotionally while bidding farewell to the delegation: "Soviet youth have always cared about the struggles and happiness of Chinese youth, and we share the joy of your victory in the struggle. We also know that the current situation of Chinese youth is still difficult, and we are willing to share your difficulties and hardships."

    This was not just empty talk. At the Stalin Mechanical Manufacturing Factory in Leningrad, the delegation witnessed firsthand Soviet workers working selflessly to manufacture steam turbine machines for China. At the Dusa Porozh Steel Plant, the delegation saw steel plates with markings indicating they were to be shipped to China.

    What impressed the delegation deeply was the upsurge of peaceful construction among the Soviet people. The delegation was amazed that the serious damage suffered during World War II (equivalent to four and a half times the total losses of the thirty-four participating countries in World War I) was now almost invisible. Everywhere there were neat, garden-like factories, residences, and streets. Production and construction were proceeding at an accelerated pace. Overfulfilling tasks became a common occurrence. A worker in Moscow was already carrying out the production tasks for 1960. The Stakhanovite movement has moved from individual to collective. The delegation visited the Kelpul Measuring Tool Factory in Moscow, where all the workers were Stakhanovite workers who completed their five-year plan in three years and seven months. As a result of the scientification and mechanization of Soviet industrial and agricultural production, the opposition between intellectual and manual labor, and the opposition between urban and rural areas, is beginning to be eliminated. The delegation visited the Donbas coal mine, where all mining was done with mechanical equipment. The Soviet Union is also widely carrying out the merger movement of collective farms and the urbanization movement of rural villages. The delegation visited the Kiev Khrushchev Collective Farm, where the construction of a farm town was underway after the merger of collective farms.

    The delegation extensively studied the work of the Soviet Communist Youth League in various aspects. The Soviet Komsomol now has 12 million members, and the Young Pioneers have 15 million. The development of the Communist Youth League is very rapid, with about 5 million new members after the war; it also plays a significant role. In particular, the communist education of the younger generation has become the central task of the Soviet Communist Youth League. (Attached picture)

　　中国青年访苏代表团返抵北京
    在苏受到亲切帮助学习上有丰富收获
    【本报讯】以中国新民主主义青年团中央书记冯文彬为首的中国青年访苏代表团一部分团员，于一月二十日下午四时返抵北京。
    代表团于去年十月二十日前往苏联，团员共五十余人，包括青年工作者及青年战斗英雄张明、赵兴元、郭俊卿、劳动模范田桂英、梁军等。代表团访问了庄严的莫斯科、英雄城列宁格勒、古城基辅、煤矿中心顿巴斯、著名的第聂伯水力发电站、美丽的克里米亚现有一部分团员正在访问斯大林格勒、乔治亚）；访问了成百的工厂、学校、农村；与苏联共青团中央负责人、各地团组织及有关部门举行座谈，学习苏联共产主义青年团在工人、农民、学生、少年儿童、部队等方面的宣传教育及组织等工作经验。由于苏联人民尤其是苏联青年亲兄弟般的帮助，代表团的任务顺利完成。
    代表团在访问苏联的两个多月内，受到苏联人民热烈的欢迎与亲切的接待。中国人民志愿部队在朝鲜英勇作战获得胜利的消息传到苏联，更激起苏联人民对中国的热爱。代表团也深为苏联青年对中国青年的真切友谊所感动。在伊尔库茨克，一位苏联青年在欢送代表团时激动地说：“苏联青年从来关怀着中国青年的斗争与幸福，我们分担着你们斗争胜利的欢乐。我们也知道，中国青年目前的处境仍旧有困难，我们愿分担你们的困难与辛苦。”
    这不是一句空话。在列宁格勒斯大林机械制造厂，代表团亲眼看到苏联工人正为中国制造蒸汽透平机而忘我地劳动着。在杜萨波罗什炼钢厂，代表团又看到生产出来的钢板上写着运往中国的字样。
    给予代表团以深刻印象的是苏联人民和平建设的热潮。使代表团深以为惊奇的是在二次大战中遭受了严重破坏（相等于第一次世界大战时三十四个参战国家损失总和的四倍半）现在都几乎看不出战争破坏的痕迹。到处是整齐的花园似的工厂、住宅和街道。生产建设在超速度地进行着。超额完成任务成为普遍的情形。莫斯科一个工人已经在执行一九六○年的生产任务。斯塔哈诺夫运动已从个人走向集体化。代表团曾参观莫斯科克尔蒲尔测量工具工厂，全厂工人都是斯塔哈诺夫工作者，他们三年七个月完成了五年的计划。苏联工农业生产的科学化与机械化的结果，正在开始消灭智力劳动与体力劳动的对立，城市与乡村的对立。代表团参观了顿巴斯煤矿，那儿采矿已全部用机械化装置。苏联又正在广泛开展集体农庄的合并运动与乡村城市化运动。代表团参观了农庄合并后正在建设农庄城的基辅赫鲁舍夫集体农庄。
    代表团曾广泛地学习苏联共产主义青年团各方面的工作。苏联共青团员现有一千二百万，少先队员有一千五百万。共产主义青年团的发展很快，在战后即发展了五百万左右；所起的作用也很大。尤其是对于青少年一代的共产主义教育，成为苏联共青团的中心任务。（附图片）
