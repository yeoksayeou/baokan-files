Hunan Liuyang County Worker Yu Yongjiu Writes Letter to Chairman Mao, Offering a Union Membership Card Preserved for Over Twenty Years

[This Newspaper News] Yu Yongjiu, an old mud worker from Liuyang County, Hunan, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and offered his union membership card from the Land Revolution era, which he had preserved for over twenty years. The original letter is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

I am a mud worker living in Huaqiao, Liuyang County. I am already sixty-two years old this year. In 1925, I worked in Pingjiang and joined my own organization - the union. For the sake of the proletariat's liberation, our revolutionary enthusiasm was very high at that time. Unfortunately, later, the reactionary Xu Kexiang led troops into Pingjiang City, massacring workers and peasants. We were forced to flee in a panic in the dark of night. I cherish my organization very much. I believe that the oppressed will eventually have a day to turn over. Therefore, I put my membership card under my socks (the purplish-brown area on the back of the card is where it rusted inside the sock). After returning home, I hid it in the cracks of the wall until I found it again after liberation last year. This time, I attended a meeting at the County Federation of Trade Unions and heard that you were collecting documents and certificates from the Land Revolution period. I am sending this badge to you as a revolutionary memento.

Chairman Mao: Our proletariat has now turned over and stood up, thanks to the Communist Party and you. We are willing to follow you and move forward forever! I wish you eternal health!

　　湖南浏阳县工人俞永久写信给毛主席
    献出保藏二十余年的工会会员证
    【本报讯】湖南浏阳县老泥水工人俞永久写信给毛主席，并献出他保存了二十多年的土地革命时代的工会会员证。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我是一个泥水工人，家住在浏阳县花桥，今年已经六十二岁。一九二五年，我在平江做工，曾加入了自己的组织——工会。为了无产阶级的翻身，那时候我们的革命情绪是非常高的。不幸后来反动派许克祥带了军队，进入平江城，残杀工农群众，我们被迫在黑夜里仓惶逃走。我很爱惜自己的组织。我相信受压迫的人终会有翻身的一天到来。因此，我把我的会员证放在袜子底下（证的背面有紫褐色处就是放在袜内生了锈的）。回家后，又将它藏在墙壁缝里，直到去年解放才找出来。这次我在县总工会开会，听说你要征集土地革命时候的文件与证件，我特将这一个证章献给你，作为革命的纪念物。
    毛主席：我们无产阶级现在翻了大身，是共产党和你赐给我们的，我们愿跟着你永远前进！我祝福你永远健康！
