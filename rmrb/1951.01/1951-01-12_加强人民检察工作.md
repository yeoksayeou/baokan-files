Strengthening the People's Procuratorate Work

　　The People's Procuratorate is one of the powerful weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship, the protector of revolutionary law and discipline and revolutionary order, and an important department of the people's power organs. It not only implements strict supervision of national laws and decrees to ensure that they are thoroughly implemented, but also wages a resolute struggle against all illegal and criminal acts that undermine the interests of the state and the people. Therefore, Article 28 of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government stipulates: "The Supreme People's Procuratorate bears the highest procuratorial responsibility for the strict observance of laws by government agencies, public officials, and the people of the whole country."

　　Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, procuratorial organs at all levels have been established. In the year since the establishment of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, more than one hundred people's procuratorates at all levels have been established. They have done a lot of work in prosecuting counter-revolutionary cases and cases of violation of laws and disciplines, and have achieved some successes and experience, laying a preliminary foundation for the people's procuratorial work and opening up avenues for the continued development of this work in the future.

　　However, these achievements and experiences are clearly far from enough. People's procuratorial organs at all levels have not yet been universally established, and those that have been established, including the Supreme People's Procuratorate, are still extremely inadequate. The work of some procuratorates has not yet been unfolded, and most procuratorial cadres are still unfamiliar with procuratorial business. The procuratorial organs still lack close ties with other organs, groups, and the broad masses. These are all in urgent need of improvement.

　　We should vigorously establish and strengthen procuratorial organs at all levels. Currently, in the country, out of nearly three thousand administrative units from large administrative regions to counties and towns, only about five percent of procuratorates at all levels have been established. In provinces such as Guangxi, even the provincial procuratorate has not yet been established. Some units that have been established are unable to carry out their work due to a lack of cadres. Governments at all levels should do their best to allocate cadres and help train and cultivate cadres. Due to the nature of the procuratorial organs, the cadres allocated must be of pure character and have firm principles.

　　Procuratorial organs at all levels should carry out their work step by step and with emphasis. According to the provisions of the Common Program of the People's Republic of China, the functions and tasks of the procuratorial organs are very important and extensive. They have the power to supervise whether the measures of government organs at all levels conform to the laws and decrees of the Central People's Government; they have the power to supervise whether government organs, groups, public officials, and the people of the whole country strictly abide by the laws of the country; they have the power to supervise whether judicial and public security organs and prisons have illegally arrested and judged people; they have the power to conduct investigations and file public prosecutions in criminal cases; and they have the power to participate in civil cases and administrative litigations related to the interests of the whole society and working people. However, since the current structure of the procuratorial organs is not yet sound and the business is not yet familiar, work should only be carried out step by step and with emphasis. At present, it should temporarily focus on investigating major criminal cases (especially counter-revolutionary cases and criminal punishment cases involving violations of laws and disciplines by public officials) and investigating whether judicial and public security organs have illegally arrested and judged people.

　　Improving business and accumulating experience are the urgent tasks of procuratorial organs at all levels. In the people's China, the procuratorial organs are completely new departments. The set of procuratorial systems used by the Kuomintang in the past as a tool to oppress the people should be completely abolished. And the Soviet socialist procuratorial system, which is the direction of China's procuratorial system, should not be mechanically transported due to the different subjective and objective conditions. Therefore, in addition to striving to learn from the Soviet experience, our procuratorial workers should also learn from the experience of our people's judicial and public security organs in fighting against class enemies and those who violate laws and disciplines for a long time, and combine it with today's actual situation to create a set of procuratorial systems suitable for actual needs. Our procuratorial work cadres must be familiar with various policies and decrees and understand the social situation. Therefore, our procuratorial work cadres should make redoubled efforts to study politics and business, and strive to improve themselves. At the same time, they should also strengthen the publicity of the legal system to the masses.

　　The People's Procuratorate should establish close ties with various organs, groups, and the masses. The scope of the procuratorial organs' exercise of legal supervision is very broad. Therefore, it is difficult to complete this arduous task by relying solely on the strength of the procuratorial organs themselves. In addition to accepting accusations of illegal and criminal acts, the procuratorial organs should arrange a wide range of inspection networks and conduct regular investigations. The procuratorial organs should closely cooperate with the judicial, public security, and supervisory organs in order to jointly fight against illegal and criminal acts.

　　At present, our country is carrying out peaceful construction on the one hand and patriotic struggle against the US aggression and aid to Korea on the other. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the construction and struggle tasks, there must be strict revolutionary law and discipline and a consolidated revolutionary order. Domestic and foreign enemies are using all methods to carry out sabotage activities from our inside and outside. Therefore, the arduous task of fighting against these enemies to safeguard revolutionary law and discipline and revolutionary order has been increasingly heavily placed in front of our young procuratorial organs. Our procuratorial workers must conscientiously shoulder this important task, and governments at all levels and all the people must attach importance to this work and assist it with great effort.

### 加强人民检察工作

　　加强人民检察工作
    人民检察机关是人民民主专政的有力武器之一，是革命法纪和革命秩序的保护者，是人民政权机构中的一个重要部门。它不仅对于国家法律法令要实行严格的监督，使之彻底被执行；而且对于破坏国家和人民利益的一切违法和犯罪行为要进行坚决的斗争。因此，中央人民政府组织法第二十八条规定：“最高人民检察署对政府机关、公务人员和全国国民之严格遵守法律，负最高的检察责任。”
    中央人民政府成立以后即开始建立各级检察机关，从最高人民检察署建立以后到现在的一年中，已先后成立了各级人民检察署一百多处，在检察反革命案件和违犯法纪案件等方面，都做了许多工作，并已取得若干成绩和经验，打下了人民检察工作的初步基础，开辟了今后继续发展这一工作的途径。
    但是，这些成绩和经验显然还是非常不够的。各级人民检察机关还没有普遍建立起来，而且已建立起来的包括最高人民检察署在内，也还极不充实；若干检察署的工作还没有展开，一般检察干部对于检察业务还很生疏；检察机关与其他机关、团体和广大群众还缺乏密切的联系。这些都是亟待改进的。
    我们应该用大力建立和充实各级检察机关。目前在全国，从大行政区到县镇，将近三千个行政单位中，各级检察署只建立了大约百分之五。如广西等省，连省检察署都尚未建立。已经建立的若干单位，由于缺乏干部，还无法开展工作。各级政府应尽力调配干部，帮助训练与培养干部。由于检察机关的性质，所调配的干部必须是品质纯洁和有坚定原则性的。
    各级检察机关应有步骤有重点地去开展工作。根据中华人民共和国共同纲领的规定，检察机关的职权与任务是非常重大而广泛的。它有权监督各级政府机关的措施是否符合于中央人民政府的法律和政令；它有权监督政府机关、团体、公务人员、全国国民是否严格遵守国家的法律；它有权监督司法公安机关及监所是否有违法拘捕和判决等情事；它有权对刑事案件执行侦查与提起公诉；它有权参与与全国社会和劳动人民利益有关的民事案件与行政诉讼。但是由于检察机关目前机构还不健全，业务还不熟悉，因此只应该有步骤有重点地进行工作。在目前它应该暂以检察重大的刑事案件（尤其是反革命案件和公务人员违犯法纪的刑事处分案件）和检察司法公安机关有无违法拘捕与判决等情事为工作的重点。
    提高业务，积累经验，是各级检察机关的迫切任务。在人民的中国，检察机关完全是新的部门。过去国民党用为压迫人民的工具的那一套检察制度既应全部废除，而作为中国检察制度方向的苏联社会主义检察制度，由于主观和客观条件的不尽相同，又不应机械地搬运。因此，我们的检察工作者除了应当努力学习苏联的经验之外，还应学习我们人民司法和公安机关过去长期与阶级敌人和违犯法纪者斗争的经验结合今日的实际情形，来创造一套适于实际需要的检察制度。我们的检察工作干部，必须熟习各种政策政令，了解社会情况。因此，我们的检察工作干部，应以加倍的努力来学习政治和业务，努力提高自己；同时还应当对群众加强关于法制的宣传。
    人民检察机关应与各机关、团体和群众取得密切的联系。检察机关行使法律监督权的范围是很广泛的，因之，单靠检察机关本身的力量，就难于完成这个艰巨的任务。检察机关除了接受有关违法犯罪的控告以外，应当布置广泛的检察网，经常地进行调查工作。检察机关应当与司法、公安、监察机关密切配合，以便共同与违法犯罪行为作斗争。
    目前我们的国家一方面在进行和平建设，一方面在进行抗美援朝的爱国斗争。为了保证顺利地执行建设和斗争任务，必须有严密的革命法纪和巩固的革命秩序。国内和国外的敌人正以一切方法从我们的内部和外部来进行破坏的活动，因此，与这些敌人作斗争，来维护革命法纪和革命秩序的艰巨任务，已经日益加重地摆在我们年青的检察机关的面前了。我们的检察工作者要兢兢业业地把这一重大任务担负起来，同时各级人民政府以及全体人民也须重视这一工作，并用大力加以协助。
