　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th – Following widespread improvements in Tianjin's private industries, most sectors have, based on their business conditions and through labor-management consultations, fully or partially restored the wages temporarily reduced during the industrial and commercial difficulties of last spring. Currently, industries that have fully restored wages include cotton weaving, rubber, machine dyeing and finishing, silk weaving, sand casting, wire drawing, and machinery, totaling fifteen sectors; industries that have partially restored wages include match factories and chemical dyes, among others. After these factories restored wages, they generally did not exceed the average wage level in Tianjin. In some factories within the cotton weaving, machine dyeing and finishing, and glassware industries, where business conditions are better, in addition to restoring the original salaries of employees, unreasonable wages from the past were also appropriately adjusted. Furthermore, factories where business conditions have initially improved but are not yet able to restore workers' original salaries have generally increased worker benefits within possible limits, allowing labor-management relations to remain normal.

　　天津私营企业恢复工人原薪
    【新华社天津十五日电】天津市私营工业在普遍获得好转后，已有大部行业根据营业情况，通过劳资协商，全部或部分的恢复了去春工商业困难期间暂时降低的工资。目前全部恢复工资的包括有棉织、橡胶、机器染整、丝织、翻砂、拔丝、机器等十五个行业；部分恢复的包括火柴、化学染料等业。这些工厂的工资恢复以后，大体上都不超过天津市一般的工资水平。在营业情况较好的棉织、机器染整、料器等行业中的部分工厂，除恢复职工原薪外，并将过去不合理的工资做了适当调整。此外，营业情况初步好转而尚无力恢复工人原薪的工厂，一般地也都在可能范围内增加了工人福利，使劳资关系得以保持正常。
