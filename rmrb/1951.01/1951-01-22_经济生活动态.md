Economic Life Trends
	Developments in Beijing's Private Industry and Commerce Over the Past Year
	According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, private industry in Beijing (including general handicrafts and special handicrafts) increased by 3,429 units in the past year compared to 1949. Commerce also increased by 715 units compared to 1949. In terms of the output of major industrial products, flour production increased by 1.06 times, and cloth production increased by 63.61 percent.
	Beijing Bureau of Industry and Commerce Invites Industrial and Commercial Figures to Symposium
	On the 10th of this month, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce invited figures from Beijing's industrial and commercial sectors to a symposium to exchange opinions on the direction of development of Beijing's private industry and commerce this year. The meeting focused on discussing six important issues closely related to the development of private industry and commerce this year, and reached a unanimous and clear understanding: this year's private industry should be developed with a focus on the existing foundation based on objective circumstances, and vigorously organize the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas; re-evaluating the assets of private enterprises is an important and arduous task, and should be studied and launched in a timely manner.
	North China Corrects Spontaneous Flow Phenomenon in Winter Production
	Winter production in North China has achieved certain results. However, due to insufficient attention paid to winter production by the leading organs in some areas, and the complacency of some farmers due to last year's bumper harvest, winter production in many areas has fallen into a state of spontaneous flow. The leading organs in various places, based on the above situation, conducted in-depth inspections in a timely manner, corrected the thinking of some cadres who underestimated winter production, and publicized the importance of carrying out winter production to the masses of farmers. The winter production movement in many counties has been launched smoothly as a result. After summarizing production and explaining the importance of winter production to the masses, more than 100 villages in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, quickly launched the winter production movement.
	Central South Several Factories Care About Workers' Welfare
	Several factories and mines in the Central South region have further encouraged workers' enthusiasm for labor and significantly improved production efficiency by caring about workers' lives and welfare. For example, the Jiangxi Branch of the Central South Nonferrous Metals Administration has frequently transported large quantities of grain, cloth, daily necessities, and vegetables to the mines since the first quarter of 1950, supplying them to the miners at low prices. The mines also repaired worker sheds, sand washing sheds, toilets, and bathhouses, added doctors and medical equipment to the clinics, and provided work clothes and rubber shoes to workers working in the mine pits. These measures encouraged workers' labor enthusiasm and improved production efficiency. This is an important reason why the tin smelting and magnetic separation plants under the bureau were able to overfulfill the 1950 production plan two months ahead of schedule.
	Hubei Farm Implement Factory's Current Affairs Education Promotes Production
	The Hubei Farm Implement Factory has achieved remarkable results in production due to the successful development of current affairs education and the integration of various tasks with the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country. At the end of last October, the factory organized a study committee with the participation of the heads of the Chinese Communist Party branch, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League branch to promote the study of current affairs among all employees. Through studying documents, listening to reports, discussions, and organizing newspaper reading, the hatred of all workers for American imperialism and their patriotic enthusiasm were greatly stimulated. Under the leadership of the factory's labor models, a heated production competition was launched. Last November, the factory overfulfilled the production task by 20 percent, and production efficiency continued to improve in December. The manufacturing of sprayers has been shortened by nearly half compared to October. The workers also voluntarily signed up to participate in security work, patrolling the factory in shifts every night to protect the factory.

           京私营工商业一年来的发展
    据京市工商局统计：去年一年中，京市私营工业（其中包括一般手工业与特种手工艺在内），较一九四九年实增三千四百二十九户。商业也较一九四九年增加七百十五户。在主要工业品产量方面，面粉增产一·○六倍；布匹增产百分之六三·六一。
  京工商局邀工商界人士座谈
    北京市人民政府工商局于本月十日邀请京市工商界人士举行座谈会，交换关于今年北京私营工商业发展方向的意见。会上集中讨论了密切关联本年度私营工商业发展的六个重要问题，获得了一致明确的认识：本年度的私营工业应在现有基础上根据客观情势有重点地发展，并大力组织城乡物资交流；重估私营企业资产是一件重要而又艰巨的工作，应及时研究、展开。
  华北纠正冬季生产中自流现象
    华北各地冬季生产，已有一定成绩。但由于某些地区的领导机关对冬季生产重视不够，以及部分农民因去年农产丰收而产生了自满情绪，不少地区的冬季生产陷于自流。各地领导机关根据上述情况，及时进行了深入的检查，纠正了某些干部轻视冬季生产的思想，向农民群众宣传了进行冬季生产的重要性，不少县的冬季生产运动因以顺利展开。山西陵川县通过总结生产，向群众说明冬季生产的重要性以后，一百多个村子的冬季生产运动就迅速发动起来了。
  中南若干工厂关心工人福利
    中南区若干厂矿由于关心工人生活福利，更加鼓舞了工人的劳动热情，使生产效率显著提高。如中南有色金属管理局江西分局在一九五○年第一季度以后，经常大批运输粮食、布匹、日用品、菜蔬等到矿山上，廉价供应矿工。各矿并修理了工棚、洗砂棚、厕所、浴室，给各诊疗所增加了医生和医药设备，又给在矿坑内工作的工人发给工作服和胶鞋。这些措施鼓舞了工人的劳动情绪，提高了生产效率。这是该局所属炼锡和磁选两厂能够提前两月超额完成一九五零年的生产计划的重要原因。
  湖北农具制造厂时事教育推动了生产
    湖北农具制造厂由于成功地开展了时事教育，并把各种工作和抗美援朝保家卫国运动结合起来，在生产方面获得了显著成绩。去年十月底，该厂在中国共产党支部、行政、工会和青年团支部的负责人的参加下，组织了学习委员会，以推动全厂职工的时事学习。经过学习文件、听报告、讨论、组织读报等，大大激发了全体工人对美帝国主义的仇恨和爱国热忱。在全厂劳动模范带动下，热烈展开了生产竞赛。去年十一月份该厂生产任务，超额百分之二十完成，十二月份生产效率续有提高。喷雾器的制造已较十月份缩短了将近一半时间。工人们并自动报名参加保安工作，每夜轮流在厂内巡逻，保护工厂。
