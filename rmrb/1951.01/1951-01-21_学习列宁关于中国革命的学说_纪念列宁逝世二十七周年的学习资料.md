　　Studying Lenin's Doctrine on the Chinese Revolution
    Learning Materials Commemorating the 27th Anniversary of Lenin's Death
    Hu Hua
    "No force in the world can prevent the victory of the proletariat, and this victory will liberate the people of Europe and the people of Asia together."
              ——Lenin

    Vladimir Ilyich Lenin has been dead for twenty-seven years. This great teacher of working people all over the world was, during his lifetime, the most deeply concerned, guiding, and assisting figure in the cause of liberation for the Chinese and Asian people. Now, his brilliant predictions regarding the revolutions of the Asian people have one by one become reality. The Chinese people's revolution has achieved a glorious victory, world imperialism has suffered a historic defeat in Asia, and the dawn of liberation for all Asian people is within sight. However, to achieve the complete liberation of the people of Asia, Europe, and even the entire world, we still need to do more arduous and greater work. Undoubtedly, the second half of the twentieth century will be an era in which Marxism-Leninism achieves great victories globally. In the first year of the second half of the twentieth century, as we commemorate the twenty-seventh anniversary of the death of this giant of world revolution—Lenin—we should more extensively study his doctrine on the Chinese revolution.

    Everyone knows that the cause of the Chinese people's liberation is inseparable from the name of Lenin. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" published in 1949, said: "Our Party has gone through twenty-eight years. As everyone knows, it has not been a peaceful journey, but one traveled in difficult circumstances. We have to fight enemies both inside and outside the country, inside and outside the Party. Thanks to Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, they gave us weapons. These weapons are not machine guns, but Marxism-Leninism." Just as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, the Chinese people, because they found Marxism-Leninism, this universally applicable truth, transformed the face of the Chinese revolution. Lenin and his successor Stalin not only taught the Chinese people with the successful experience of leading the Soviet people in revolution and national construction, providing them with a model to learn from; but also taught the Chinese people with their immortal theory of colonial people's revolution, inspiring them on how to fight for their own liberation. The Chinese people, through their great leader Comrade Mao Zedong's creative application of these experiences and theories to the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, finally defeated the enemy and achieved today's victory. Lenin—the greatest thinker and revolutionary in human history, the inspirer of the victory of the Chinese revolution—from him, we can learn and should learn too much. Today, what is particularly valuable to us is that, in the twenty-four years from 1900 to 1923, he personally did a great deal of theoretical work on the issue of the Chinese revolution. These classic instructions on the Chinese revolution are treasures in our revolutionary theoretical treasury, and are also the best reading material to guide us to further study Leninism and the entire theory of the Chinese revolution. This article aims to introduce some of the fifteen articles written by Lenin during the above period, translated in the "Lenin and Stalin on China" book (1950 edition, Liberation Press) from the "Must-Read for Cadres" series. However, the content involved in Lenin's fifteen articles is too rich, and the author can only introduce some of the basic arguments for the reference of comrades in studying Lenin's doctrine on the Chinese revolution.

      I. On the Old Democratic Revolution in China Concerning the Boxer Movement

    Lenin's earliest article on the Chinese revolution was a political commentary entitled "The War in China," published in the first issue of the "Iskra" newspaper in December 1900. This article was published in response to the situation at the time, which was: the imperialist powers launched a war of aggression against China—the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion, armed occupation of the Beijing-Tianjin area, bloody suppression of the Chinese people's spontaneous anti-imperialist movement—the Boxer Movement, and rampant rape, murder, and robbery of the people in the Beijing-Tianjin area, while cheering for "European culture's defeat of Chinese barbarism"! In this article, Lenin raised the following questions: "How should socialists treat this war? For whose benefit is the war being waged? What is the true meaning of the policy pursued by the Russian government?" ("Lenin and Stalin on China," 1950 edition, Liberation Press, pp. 15-16) Here, Lenin educated the international proletariat and the Russian working people in the spirit of clear proletarian internationalism, and waged the most resolute struggle against imperialist nationalism and chauvinism.

    Lenin first expressed his warm sympathy for the spontaneous national resistance movement of the working people in northern China at that time—the Boxer Movement. He sternly refuted the imperialists' fallacy that the Boxer Movement was "yellow people's hatred of white people" and "Chinese people's hatred of European culture and civilization," and defended the justness of the Boxer Movement, saying:
    "Yes, the Chinese do indeed hate Europeans, but what kind of Europeans do they hate, and why? The Chinese do not hate the European people, because they have no conflict with the European people. They hate European capitalists and the European governments that are subservient to the capitalists. Can the Chinese not hate those who come to China only to make money, those who use their praised civilization only to deceive, plunder, and commit violence, those who fight China only to gain the right to sell opium that poisons the people (the Anglo-French war against China in 1856), those who hypocritically cover up their policy of plunder by spreading Christianity?" (Ibid., p. 16) Indeed, although the Boxer Movement was still an old-style uprising of the working people, and the insurgents were once used by the corrupt Qing Dynasty, their heroic spirit of resistance against foreign aggressors is forever worthy of our respect and praise; and the imperialists who strangled the Boxer Movement forever owe a blood debt to the Chinese people. Lenin recorded this blood debt and severely rebuked the imperialist aggressors for their atrocities everywhere, saying:

    "These victories are less victories over the enemy's regular army than victories over Chinese insurgents, and even more so victories over the unarmed Chinese people, drowning and slaughtering them, not hesitating to kill women and children, not to mention robbing palaces, residences, and shops." (Ibid., p. 15)

    "They steal from China as if stealing from a corpse, and when this imaginary corpse tries to resist, they pounce on it like a beast, burning entire villages, drowning the people in the Heilongjiang River, shooting and slaughtering unarmed residents and their wives and children." (Ibid., pp. 17-18)

    Lenin pointed out that the imperialist powers were waging this war on the one hand to suppress the Chinese insurgents, and on the other hand to further plunder and divide China by suppressing the insurgents. Lenin said:

    "Now the greedy claws of European capitalists are reaching into China. ... If we speak frankly, then it must be said that the European governments (and the Russian government was almost the first) have already begun to divide China." (Ibid., p. 17)

    We know that since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, the imperialist powers have each seized spheres of influence in China, firmly relegating China to a semi-colonial status, and the talk of the imperialist powers dividing China has since prevailed for a time. At the time Lenin wrote this article, the imperialist powers had already occupied Beijing and Tianjin, attempting to take the opportunity to divide China. However, we know that this attempt at division was not realized later. The reason, on the one hand, was undoubtedly due to the failure of the conflicting interests among the imperialist powers to reach a compromise and unanimous opinion for a time; but on the other hand, the main reason was due to the imperialists' fear of the resistance of the Chinese people. As Count Waldersee, the commander of the invading allied forces at the time, admitted: "No country in Europe, America, or Japan has the brainpower and military power to rule one-fourth of the world's population. Therefore, the matter of division is actually a poor policy" (Waldersee's speech). The resistance of the Chinese people under the banner of the Boxer Movement, and the opposition of the people of the world headed by Lenin, were the most fundamental reasons why China was not divided at that time.

    In this article, Lenin pointed out to the Russian people that this war was being waged for the "interests of a tiny minority of capitalists and bureaucrats," and that the policy pursued by the Russian government was a policy of "prostrating itself before a tiny minority of big capitalists and nobles" at the "sacrifice of the interests of the people of the whole country." He pointed out that the interests of the Chinese and Russian people were consistent, saying:

    "But the Chinese people have never oppressed the Russian people: the Chinese people themselves suffer the same misfortunes as the Russian people—suffering from the pain given by the Asian-style government that extorts taxes from starving peasants and suppresses any tendency to seek freedom by force, suffering from the oppression of capital that has already invaded China." (Ibid., pp. 20-21)

    Therefore, he loudly called for opposition to the Tsarist government's aggression against China, denounced "the Tsarist government's policy in China as a criminal policy," and called on the workers to: "Rise up with all their strength against those who provoke national hatred and divert the working people's attention from their real enemies." (Ibid., p. 21)

    From this article on the Boxer Movement written by Lenin fifty years ago, we can learn Lenin's clear and firm internationalist stance. His deep sympathy for the suffering of the Chinese people and his enthusiastic praise for our heroic ancestors move us deeply even today.

  Concerning the Xinhai Revolution

    The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the feudal imperial autocratic political system that had existed in China for two or three thousand years. This aroused Lenin and the Russian proletariat's warm cheers and congratulations for the infinitely bright future of the Chinese people. In January 1912, the Second Conference of Russian Bolsheviks specifically passed a resolution on the Chinese Revolution, pointing out "the world significance of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, because this revolutionary struggle will liberate Asia and destroy the rule of the European bourgeoisie." And "it shows that the Russian proletariat watches the success of the Chinese revolutionary people with sincere excitement and full sympathy; it condemns the Russian liberalism that supports the Tsarist government's policy of aggression." ("On the Chinese Revolution," Ibid., p. 22)

    In November 1912 (the first year of the Republic of China), Lenin, in an article published in "Pravda" entitled "Renewing China," again said full of hope: "Four hundred million backward Asians have already gained freedom, have already awakened and joined political life. One-fourth of the earth's population can be said to have moved from slumber to light, movement, and struggle." (Ibid., p. 32)

    Regarding the nature of the Xinhai Revolution, Lenin pointed out that it was "Asia's modern bourgeois revolution" (Ibid., p. 24), which is what Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On New Democracy," the Chinese old democratic revolution that began in a fuller sense. Lenin pointed out that the most basic driving force of this revolution was the Chinese laboring masses. He said:

    "Without the masses' great spiritual and revolutionary upsurge, Chinese democracy could not have overthrown the old system in China and won the republic. This upsurge presupposes and generates sincere sympathy for the condition of the laboring masses and fierce hatred for their oppressors and exploiters." ("Chinese Democracy and Populism," Ibid., p. 27)

    Indeed, the strength of the Xingzhonghui and Tongmenghui in carrying out revolutionary struggles at that time mainly relied on secret societies. And secret societies were primitive revolutionary organizations of peasants, handicraftsmen, and a part of the modern industrial proletariat at that time. The characteristics of these laboring people are also, as Lenin said: "This great people is not only good at lamenting its centuries of enslavement, not only good at dreaming of freedom and equality, but also good at fighting against China's centuries of oppressors." (Ibid., p. 25) Obviously, without the struggle of these laboring people, there would be no Xinhai Revolution.

    Historical facts tell us that the Chinese proletariat was once a heroic participant in this struggle. But at this time, the strength of the Chinese proletariat was still weak. "At this time, the Chinese proletariat had not yet stepped onto the political stage as a conscious and independent class force, but participated in the revolution as followers of the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie." ("On New Democracy") The "political leaders of this revolution were the Chinese petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie (their intellectuals)." The Chinese bourgeoisie at this time still had the ability to lead the revolution. Lenin said:

    "The bourgeoisie of the West has already been corrupted, and its gravedigger—the proletariat—already stands before it. But in Asia, there is still a bourgeoisie that can represent genuine, militant, and thorough democracy." ("Chinese Democracy and Populism," Ibid., p. 26)

    This is a correct conclusion drawn by Lenin based on a scientific examination of the course of Chinese social development and the historical role played by the Chinese bourgeoisie in the Xinhai Revolution. Sun Yat-sen, the representative of the political thought of the Chinese bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, proposed a democratic political program (nationalism, democracy, people's livelihood) in this revolution, which was precisely a manifestation of their active political leadership in this revolution. Undoubtedly, the proposal of this revolutionary democratic program was a great step forward in the history of the Chinese people's awakening. Lenin praised this program, saying:

    "Militant and true democracy permeates every line of Sun Yat-sen's program. Fully understands the insufficiency of "racial" revolution, has no disregard for politics or even contempt for political freedom, or even allows the idea that Chinese autocracy can coexist with Chinese "social reform," Chinese constitutional reform, etc. This is complete democracy with republican demands. Directly raises the issue of the masses' living conditions and struggles, warmly sympathizes with the laborers and the exploited, and believes in their integrity and their strength.

    What lies before us is a truly great system of thought of a truly great people." ("Chinese Democracy and Populism," Ibid., pp. 24-25)

    However, it must be pointed out that Lenin did not therefore adopt a blindly optimistic attitude towards this revolution. Because the bourgeoisie leading the revolution had great political weakness and compromise, this revolution also similarly had this weakness. In July 1912, Lenin had already brilliantly revealed this serious weakness of the Xinhai Revolution, that is, it not only did not fundamentally destroy the foundation of feudal forces, but also compromised with Yuan Shikai, the representative of feudal forces at that time, and handed over the fruits of the revolution to Yuan Shikai, who pretended to be revolutionary, in February 1912. Lenin predicted:

    "People like Yuan Shikai are the most likely to betray: yesterday they were afraid of the emperor and prostrated themselves before him; later, seeing the revolutionary forces and feeling the victory of revolutionary democracy, they betrayed the emperor; but tomorrow, in order to collude with some new or old "constitutional" emperor, they will sell out the democrats." (Ibid., p. 26)

    Therefore, Lenin at that time believed that to implement the cause of the Xinhai Revolution, there must be true democracy, and the great strength of the people must be developed and organized. Because "without a high degree of true democratic upsurge, the Chinese people cannot have true liberation from centuries of enslavement, because only this upsurge can arouse the laboring masses, enabling them to accomplish miracles." (Ibid., p. 26)

    The reason for the abortion of the Xinhai Revolution was precisely because the revolution compromised with counter-revolution, precisely because it did not truly mobilize the broad masses. The entire course of development of the Xinhai Revolution proved the correctness and appropriateness of these brilliant predictions by Lenin. Although this revolution failed, it was indeed a good democratic education for the Chinese people. After this education, the degree of awakening of the Chinese people was greatly improved. As Lenin said in March 1913:

    "No matter what the fate of the great Republic of China, which various "civilized" jackals are now sharpening their teeth to devour, there is no force in the world that can restore the old serf system in Asia, or eradicate the heroic democratic spirit of the masses of the people in Asian and semi-Asian countries." ("Asia is a New Source of World Storms," Ibid., p. 35)

    This heroic democratic spirit (awakening) of the people prepared the necessary prerequisites for the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. If it is said that the main pillar of the revolution at that time—the broad masses of peasants—was still "not led by the proletarian party" ("Renewing China," Ibid., p. 34), this historical reason is the most fundamental of all the reasons for the failure of the Xinhai Revolution; then, to achieve the victory of the Chinese democratic revolution, it is inevitable that the newly rising proletariat and its party will shoulder the responsibility of leadership thereafter.

　　学习列宁关于中国革命的学说
    纪念列宁逝世二十七周年的学习资料
    胡华
    “世界上任何力量都不能阻止无产阶级的胜利，而这胜利将把欧洲人民和亚洲人民一同解放出来。”
              ——列宁                
    乌拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁逝世已经二十七年了。这位全世界劳动人民的伟大导师，在生前曾经是中国和亚洲人民解放事业的最深切的关心者、指导者和援助者。现在，他对亚洲人民革命的光辉的预见也已逐一地成为现实了。中国人民革命已经取得了辉煌的胜利，世界帝国主义已经在亚洲遭到了历史性的败北，全亚洲人民解放的曙光已经在望。但是，要取得亚洲、欧洲以至全世界人民的彻底解放，还需要我们做更艰苦更伟大的工作。无疑问的，二十世纪的后半叶，将是马克思、列宁主义在全球取得伟大胜利的时代。在二十世纪后半叶的第一年，我们来纪念这位世界革命巨人——列宁逝世的二十七周年，应该更广泛地学习他关于中国革命的学说。
    大家都知道，中国人民的解放事业，和列宁的名字是分不开的。毛泽东同志在一九四九年发表的“论人民民主专政”一文中说：“我们党走过二十八年了，大家知道，不是和平地走过的，而是在困难的环境中走过的，我们要和国内外党内外的敌人作战。谢谢马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林，他们给了我们以武器。这武器不是机关枪，而是马克思列宁主义。”正像毛泽东同志所指出，中国人民由于找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，中国革命的面貌就起了变化。列宁和其继承者斯大林，不仅以领导苏联人民进行革命与建国的胜利经验教导了中国人民，使中国人民得到了学习的榜样；而且用了他们的不朽的殖民地人民革命的理论教导了中国人民，启示中国人民如何去争得自己的解放。中国人民，经过自己的伟大领袖毛泽东同志把这些经验和理论创造地应用到中国革命的具体实践中来，才终于战胜了敌人，取得了今天的胜利。列宁——这位人类历史上最伟大的思想家和革命家，中国革命胜利的鼓舞者，从他那里，我们可以学习和应该学习的东西是太多了。今天，特别值得我们宝贵的，是他在一九○○年到一九二三年的二十四年中，在中国革命问题上，还亲自做了许多伟大的理论工作。这些对中国革命问题的古典的指示，是我国革命理论宝库中的珍宝，也是引导我们去进而研究列宁主义和整个中国革命理论问题的最好的读物。本文想就解放社一九五○年版“干部必读”的“列宁、斯大林论中国”一书中所译出的列宁在上述时期中所写的十五篇文章，做一点介绍。但是列宁在这十五篇文章中所涉及的内容是太丰富了，作者只能够就其中若干基本论点，作一些介绍，以供给同志们在学习列宁关于中国革命的学说时作一点参考。
      一、关于中国的旧民主主义革命关于义和团运动
    列宁论中国革命的最早的一篇文章，是他在一九○○年十二月“火星”报第一期上发表的一篇名叫“中国的战争”的政论。这篇文章是针对当时这样的情况而发表的，这就是：帝国主义列强发动了侵略中国的战争——八国联军之役，武装侵陷了京津一带，血洗了中国人民自发的反帝运动——义和团运动，并对京津一带人民肆行奸杀抢劫，而却欢呼着“欧洲文化之击败中国野蛮”！列宁在这篇文章里提出这样的问题：“社会主义者应当怎样对待这次战争？战争是为了谁的利益而进行的？俄国政府所遵循的政策的真正意义如何？”（“解放社”一九五○年版“列宁、斯大林论中国”十五、十六页）列宁在这里以明确的无产阶级的国际主义的精神来教育国际无产阶级与俄国劳动人民，而和帝国主义的民族主义及沙文主义进行了最坚决的斗争。
    列宁首先对当时中国北方的劳动人民的自发的民族反抗运动——义和团运动，表示了热烈的同情。他严正地驳斥帝国主义者硬说义和团运动是“黄种人仇视白种人”、“中国人仇视欧洲文化与文明”的谬论，而为义和团运动的正义性辩护，列宁说：
    “是的，中国人确实是憎恶欧洲人，然而他们究竟憎恶哪一种欧洲人，并且为了什么呢？中国人并不是憎恶欧洲人民，因为他们和欧洲人民并无冲突，他们是憎恶欧洲资本家及对资本家驯服的欧洲各国政府。那些到了中国只是为了赚钱的人，那些利用其被赞颂的文明只是为了欺骗、掠夺、暴行的人，那些对中国作战只是为了获得贩卖毒害人民的鸦片权的人（一八五六年的英法对华战争），那些伪善地以传布基督教来掩护掠夺政策的人，中国人能不憎恶他们吗？”（同上书十六页）的确，义和团运动虽然还是劳动人民的旧式的起义，起义者虽然曾被腐败的满清朝廷所利用，但是他们对外国侵略者的英勇的反抗精神，是永远值得我们崇敬和赞扬的；而绞杀义和团运动的帝国主义者，则永远在中国人民面前欠下了一笔血债。列宁记述了这笔血债，并严厉地斥责帝国主义侵略者在各地的暴行说：
    “的确，这些胜利与其说是战胜了敌人的正规军，倒不如说是战胜了中国的起义者，更可以说是战胜了手无寸铁的中国人民，淹死和屠杀他们，不惜残杀妇孺，至于抢劫皇宫、住宅和商店就不用说了。”（同上书十五页）
    “他们偷窃中国就像从死尸身上偷窃东西一样，而当这个假想的死尸试图反抗的时候，他们就像对待野兽一样向它猛扑，烧毁整个村落，把老百姓淹死在黑龙江中，枪毙和残杀手无寸铁的居民及其妻儿。”（同上书十七、十八页）
    列宁指出，帝国主义列强进行这个战争，一方面是为着镇压中国的起义者，另一方面则是要通过对起义者的镇压，来达到其进一步掠夺和瓜分中国的目的。列宁说：
    “现在欧洲资本家贪婪的巨爪伸向中国了。……如果直说的话，那就必须说：欧洲各国政府（而俄国政府几乎是第一个）已经开始瓜分中国了。”（同上书十七页）
    我们知道，自从一八九四——九五年中日战争之后，各帝国主义就各在中国攫取了势力范围，使中国确定地沦于半殖民地的地位，帝国主义列强瓜分中国之说，从此盛行一时。在列宁写这篇文章的当时，正是各帝国主义侵占了京津，企图乘机瓜分中国的时候。但是，我们知道这个瓜分企图后来是没有实现的。其原因，一方面固然是由于各帝国主义间的利害矛盾一时未能取得妥协与一致的意见；但另方面，主要的原因，还是由于帝国主义者震慑于中国人民的反抗。正如当时侵略联军的统帅瓦德西所供认：“无论欧美日本各国，皆无此脑力与兵力可以统治此天下生灵四分之一。故瓜分一事，实为下策”（瓦德西谈话）。以义和团为旗帜的中国人民的反抗，和以列宁为首的世界人民的反对，正是当时中国未被瓜分的最基本的原因。
    列宁在这篇文章里向俄国人民指出，这个战争是为了“区区少数资本家与官僚的利益”而进行的，俄国政府所遵循的政策，是“牺牲全国人民的利益”而“匍伏在区区少数大资本家和贵族面前”的政策。他指出：中俄两国人民的利害是一致的，他说：
    “可是中国人民从来也没有压迫过俄国人民：中国人民自身遭受着俄国人民所受尽的不幸，——遭受着从饥饿农民身上敲榨贡税并以武力压制任何求取自由的倾向的亚洲式政府所给与的苦痛，遭受着已经侵入了中国的资本的压迫。”（同上书二十、二十一页）
    因此，他大声疾呼，反对沙皇政府对中国的侵略，指斥“沙皇政府在中国的政策是一种犯罪的政策”，号召工人们：“以全力起来反对那些挑拨民族仇恨和使劳动人民的注意力离开其真正敌人的人们。”（同上书二十一页）
    从列宁的五十年前所写的这篇关于义和团运动的文章中，我们可以学习到列宁的明确而坚定的国际主义的立场。他对于中国人民的痛苦是这样深切的同情，对于我们英勇的祖先是这样热情的赞扬，使我们今天读了也不由得深受感动。
  关于辛亥革命
    辛亥革命，推翻了中国的两三千年来封建皇帝专制的政治制度。这引起了列宁和俄国无产阶级对中国人民的无限的光明前途的热烈欢呼和庆幸。一九一二年一月，俄国的布尔什维克第二次代表会议特别为中国革命作出了决议，指出“中国人民革命斗争的世界意义，因为这个革命斗争将使亚洲获得解放，摧毁欧洲资产阶级的统治。”并“表明俄国无产阶级以衷诚的兴奋和充分的同情注视中国革命人民的成功；它责斥那支持沙皇政府侵略政策的俄国自由主义的行为。”（“关于中国革命”，同上书二十二页）
    在一九一二年（民国元年）十一月，列宁在“真理报”上发表的“更新的中国”一文里，又充满了热望地说：“四万万落后的亚洲人已经获得了自由，已经觉醒起来参加政治生活了。地球上四分之一的人口，可说是已经由酣睡进到光明、运动、斗争了。”（同上书三十二页）
    关于辛亥革命的性质，列宁指出是“亚洲现代资产阶级革命”（同上书二十四页），也就是毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中所指出的，是在更完全的意义上开始了的中国旧民主主义革命。这个革命的最基本的动力，列宁指出，是中国的劳动群众。他说：
    “如果没有群众的巨大的精神的和革命的高涨，中国民主主义就不能推翻中国的旧制度，取得共和国。这种高涨是以对劳动群众状况的恳切同情与对其压迫者和剥削者的激烈憎恨为前提，并且又产生这些同情和憎恨。”（“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”，同上书二十七页）
    的确的，当时的兴中会、同盟会进行革命斗争的力量的依靠，主要是会党。而会党就是当时农民、手工业者和一部分近代产业无产者的原始的革命组织。这些劳动人民的特色，又正如列宁所说：“这个伟大的人民不仅善于悲叹自己成百年的奴隶地位，不仅善于梦想自由和平等，而且还善于同中国成百年的压迫者作斗争。”（同上文，同上书二十五页）显然如果没有这些劳动人民的斗争，也就没有辛亥革命。
    历史的事实告诉我们：中国的无产者曾是这个斗争的英勇的参加者。但是这时，中国无产阶级的力量还薄弱。“这时，中国无产阶级还没有当作一个觉悟了的独立的阶级力量登上政治舞台，还是当作小资产阶级与资产阶级的追随者参加了革命。”（“新民主主义论”）这个革命的“政治指导者是中国的小资产阶级与资产阶级（他们的知识分子）。”中国资产阶级在这时还有领导革命的能力。列宁说：
    “西方的资产阶级已经腐化了，它面前已经站着它的掘墓人——无产阶级。而在亚洲却还有能够代表真实的、战斗的、彻底的民主主义的资产阶级。”（“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”，同上书二十六页）
    这是列宁根据对于中国社会发展的行程和中国资产阶级在辛亥革命中所表现的历史作用的科学考察而得出来的正确论断。中国资产阶级和小资产阶级的政治思想的代表者孙中山，在这个革命中所提出的民主主义的政治纲领（民族、民权、民生），则正是他们对这个革命的积极的政治领导作用的表现。无疑的，这个革命民主主义纲领的提出，在中国人民觉醒史上是一个大进步。列宁称誉这个纲领说：
    “战斗的真实的民主主义渗透着孙逸仙政纲的每一行。完全懂得“种族”革命之不够，丝毫没有对政治的漠视或甚至对政治自由的轻视，或甚至容许中国专制政体可以与中国“社会改良”、与中国立宪改革等等并存的思想。这是带有共和国要求的完整的民主主义。直接提出群众生活状况、群众斗争的问题，热烈地同情劳动者和被剥削者，相信他们的正直与他们的力量。
    摆在我们面前的是一个真正伟大的人民的真正伟大的思想体系。”（《中国的民主主义与民粹主义”，同上书二十四、二十五页）
    可是，必须指出，列宁并未因此就对这个革命抱盲目乐观的态度。由于领导革命的资产阶级在政治上存在着很大的软弱性和妥协性，就使这个革命也同样的存在了这个弱点。列宁在一九一二年七月，就已经天才地揭露出辛亥革命的这个严重的弱点，即它不但没有去根本摧毁封建势力的基础，而且和当时封建势力的代表人物袁世凯实行了妥协，在一九一二年的二月，把革命的果实交给了假装革命的袁世凯。列宁预言到：
    “类如袁世凯，是最能变节的：昨天他们害怕皇帝，匍伏在他面前；后来，看见了革命力量，感到了革命民主主义的胜利，于是就背叛了皇帝，可是明天为了和什么新的或旧的‘立宪’皇帝勾结，就会出卖民主主义者。”（同上文，同上书二十六页）
    所以当时列宁认为要贯彻辛亥革命的事业，必须有真正的民主主义，必须发挥和组织人民的伟大力量。因为“没有高度的真实的民主主义的高涨，中国人民就不可能有摆脱成百年奴隶地位的真正解放，因为只有这种高涨可以激起劳动群众，使之能够完成奇迹。”（同上书二十六页）
    辛亥革命的流产的原因，正是由于革命向反革命妥协，正是由于没有真正动员起广大的群众来。辛亥革命的全部发展行程，证明了列宁这些天才预见的正确与恰切。这个革命虽然失败了，但它确是对中国人民进行了一次很好的民主教育，经过这次教育，中国人民的觉醒程度是大大的提高了。正如列宁在一九一三年三月所说：
    “不管各种“文明”豺狼现在所磨牙欲噬的伟大中华民国的命运如何，但世界上决没有一种力量能在亚洲恢复旧有的农奴制度，能铲除亚洲国家和半亚洲国家中人民群众的英勇的民主精神。”（“论亚洲是世界风暴的新泉源”，同上书三十五页）
    这种人民群众的英勇的民主精神（觉醒），就为中国的新民主主义革命准备了必要前提。如果说，当时革命的主要支柱——广大的农民群众，还“未被无产阶级政党所领导”（“更新的中国”，同上书三十四页）这个历史原因，是辛亥革命失败的各个原因中最根本的原因；那末，要取得中国民主革命的胜利，就势非由此后新起的无产阶级及其政党来担负领导责任不可了。
                  （未完）
