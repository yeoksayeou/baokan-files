The All-China Federation of Cooperatives is preparing to gradually implement a rationing system for members of well-managed cooperatives, and has decided to conduct key pilot projects in several cities and rural areas in the first quarter of 1951. The conscientious implementation of commodity rationing at preferential prices for cooperative members will not only promote the development of cooperatives, but also facilitate the sales work of state-owned trade, strengthen the planning of state-owned trade and cooperative trade, and expand the organized consumer market. State-owned trade and cooperatives at all levels should jointly ensure the implementation of the rationing system. Therefore, the following decisions are made:

1.  State-owned trade is responsible for prioritizing the supply of the following rationed goods in accordance with the rationing plan for the first quarter proposed by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. The brands and quality shall be based on the commodities listed by local companies, and preferential discounts will be given based on local wholesale list prices as follows (when supplying similar commodities with quality standards higher or lower than the listed commodities, prices should be determined based on the reasonable price difference between the supplied commodities and the listed commodities, plus the preferential discount):

    Rice 7%, Flour 7%, Coarse Grains 7%, Edible Salt 7%, White Sugar 8%, Alkali Noodles 10%, Kerosene 12%, Coal 8%, Cloth 6%.

2.  The All-China Federation of Cooperatives shall formulate rationing plans according to region, number of members, types of rationed goods, and rationing standards. One month before the start of each quarter, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives shall jointly notify local specialized companies and provincial/municipal cooperative federations of the preferential discounts and procedures for handling goods allocation. The provisional regulations for handling goods collection are as follows:

    (1) In cities and their suburbs where specialized companies are established, the municipal cooperative federation shall send the rationing plan of each grassroots cooperative in the city to the respective specialized companies and notify each grassroots cooperative to present a certificate from the municipal cooperative federation to directly collect goods from the company with cash.

    (2) The rationing plans of general rural supply and marketing cooperatives shall be uniformly managed by the provincial cooperative federation. The county cooperative federation shall, according to the notification from the provincial cooperative federation, collect rationed goods from the nearest city's specialized company on behalf of the grassroots cooperatives and distribute them to each grassroots cooperative for rationing.

    (3) If provincial or municipal cooperative federations need to purchase rationed goods from production areas or outside the region, they must be uniformly planned by the greater administrative region and reported to the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government for approval.

3.  The pricing of cooperative rationing shall be handled in accordance with Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for Cooperative Rationing.

4.  State-owned trade organs may appoint personnel to inspect the rationing work of cooperatives. For cooperatives that do not comply with rationing discipline (with the consent of the higher-level cooperative federation and trade administrative department), a penalty of periodic suspension of rationing may be imposed.

5.  Other regulations regarding rationing work shall be handled in accordance with the All-China Federation of Cooperatives' "Decision on Implementing Rationing" and "Provisional Measures for Cooperative Rationing in the First Quarter of 1951."

　　中央人民政府贸易部、全国合作社联合总社
    关于对合作社社员实行配售的联合决定
    合贸字第十七号
    全国合作社联合总社准备对办理完善的合作社社员逐步推行定量配售制，并决定于一九五一年第一季在若干城市及农村进行重点试办。对合作社社员认真实行商品的定量廉价配售，既可促进合作社的发展，也有利于国营贸易的推销工作，并可加强国营贸易与合作社贸易的计划性，扩大有组织的消费市场。国营贸易与各级合作社应共同保证配售制的贯彻实行，因特决定如下：
    一、国营贸易负责依照全国合作社联合总社提出的第一季度的配售计划，优先保证供应下列各种配售品，其牌号质量以当地公司挂牌的商品为准，并按当地批发牌价予以优待折扣如下（在供给高于或低于该挂牌商品质量标准之同类商品时，应根据该供给商品与挂牌商品之间的合理差价规定价格，再加上优待折扣）：
    大米百分之七，面粉百分之七，粗粮百分之七，食盐百分之七，白糖百分之八，碱面百分之十，煤油百分之十二，煤百分之八，布匹百分之六。
    二、全国合作社联合总社按照地区、社员人数、配售品种及定量标准制订配售计划。每季度开始一个月前，由中央人民政府贸易部及全国合作社联合总社联合通知各地专业公司及省市合作总社优待折扣及办理拨货手续。关于提货手续暂行规定如下：
    （一）凡设有专业公司的城市及其郊区，由市总社将全市基层社配售计划分别送交各专业公司，并通知各基层社持市总社证明，直接向公司现款提货。
    （二）一般农村供销合作社的配售计划应由省合作总社统一掌握。县合作总社根据省合作总社通知向就近城市之专业公司代基层合作社统一提取配售品，分发各基层社配售。
    （三）省、市合作总社如向产地或区外采办配售品，须经大行政区统一计划，报请全国合作社联合总社及中央人民政府贸易部核准。
    三、关于合作社的配售定价，依照合作社配售暂行办法第三条的办法办理。
    四、国营贸易机关得指派专人检查合作社的配售工作。对于不执行配售纪律的合作社（经上一级合作总社及贸易行政部门之同意），得执行定期停止配售的处分。
    五、关于配售工作的其他规定，均依照全国合作社联合总社“关于实行配售的决定”及“一九五一年第一季合作社配售暂行办法”办理。
