New Year's Reflections
    Yin Xianming, National Model Worker Representative of Zhengjiatun Railcar Inspection Section

    This year's New Year is the second year of victory since the founding of our People's Republic of China. It is also a year of victory won for us by the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and by the sacrifice, bloodshed, and heroic struggle of countless martyrs and valiant soldiers over the long term. Workers and peasant laboring brothers! For so many years, we have been oppressed, exploited, and ruled. Now, we have been saved by the Communist Party, and we are moving from hardship to the road of democratic freedom and happiness. The peasants have been given land and have achieved bumper harvests year after year, and their lives are improving daily. The workers have become masters of their own house, controlling the state power, enjoying labor insurance benefits. Elderly workers are cared for in nursing homes. Workers who are sick have sanatoriums and recuperation centers. Workers who are physically and mentally fatigued receive special health care. Nutritious foods such as milk and gingko are prepared for the workers. Our country truly considers the workers in every way. In the past, who would have cared about these things? Take the puppet Manchurian era for example. Workers would toil their whole lives, producing many things, and in their old age, they would still have to beg for food. If they got sick and had no money for treatment, they would just have to wait to die. We lived a life like cattle and horses, with no way out until death. We have seen this and experienced it ourselves. Who understands these hardships? Who considers the workers? Only with the Communist Party did we workers have a way out, raising our status in society. At the National Congress of Labor, Peasant, and Soldier Model Workers held in Beijing this year, we felt supremely honored! An ordinary worker, peasant, or soldier can discuss national affairs with the highest leaders of the country and jointly review the ranks of their own country. This is unprecedented in Chinese history, and the greatness of the people is clearly demonstrated. At the National Model Workers Congress, Chairman Mao instructed: "China must establish a strong national defense force and must establish a strong economic power." This sentence is engraved in my mind. I will lead the workers to constantly improve their abilities, complete or exceed the state's tasks, so that the country's economic strength and national defense strength can be rapidly strengthened.

    Recently, the people's deadly enemy—the American devils—won't let us live a good life. They have invaded Taiwan, obstructing our economic construction, launching a war of aggression against Korea, attempting to invade China and the whole world. Their ambition will not die, and peace is constantly threatened. Now, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are beating the American devils to a pulp, sending them fleeing in panic, and it looks like they will drive these wild wolves into the sea. In this situation, they are plotting to demand a ceasefire, demanding a peaceful solution. In reality, they want to catch their breath, reorganize, and carry out further aggression. It is wishful thinking to try to deceive us with this conspiracy. We have long seen through their ugly face. Unless they withdraw all their troops from Korea, we will beat them until they roll out. We have prepared enough strength. Take Zhengjiatun, a small place, for example. Just among the railway workers, there are more than two thousand two hundred volunteers to participate in the war to resist America and aid Korea. We must resolutely drive the American imperialist aggressors into the sea! We will not allow them a moment's respite.

　　新年的感想
    郑家屯检车段全国劳模代表  尹显明
    今年这个年，是咱们中华人民共和国成立后第二个胜利年，也是共产党毛主席英明领导和无数先烈牺牲流血，英勇的战士在长期斗争中给我们换来的胜利年。工人、农民劳动弟兄们！咱们多少年来受压迫、受剥削、受统治，如今被共产党救了出来，由艰难困苦走向民主自由幸福的道路。农民分了土地，并连年获得丰收，生活日益提高；工人当家作了主人，掌握国家政权，享受了劳保待遇，年老的工人在养老院养老；得病的工人有疗养院和修养所；体力和脑力稍劳累的工人，特殊受到保健待遇；给工人准备牛奶、白果等等有营养的食品。咱们的国家真是处处都给工人着想。过去可有人来管这些事？拿伪满时代来说吧，工人做一辈子工，生产了好多东西，临老年自己还得要饭，有了病没钱治，就得等着死，我们过一生牛马生活，到死为止，没有任何出路。这是我们见到并且亲自体验到的，这些苦处谁来体会？谁来替工人着想？只有有了共产党，我们工人才有了生路，提高了在社会上的地位。在今年北京召开全国工农兵劳模代表大会上，我们感到无上光荣！一个普通的工人、农民，一个士兵，能和国家最高领袖在一起商讨国家大事，并共同检阅了自己国家的队伍，这是中国有史以来没有过的事情，人民的伟大很显然的表现出来了。在全国劳模代表会上，毛主席指示说：“中国必须建立强大的国防军，必须建立强大的经济力量”。这句话时刻印在我的脑子里，我当带动工人们不断的提高自己能力，完成或超过国家任务，使国家的经济力量和国防力量迅速加强。
    最近人民的死敌——美国鬼子，不叫我们好好过日子，侵略台湾，阻碍我国经济建设，发动侵朝战争，企图侵略中国以及全世界，它的野心不死，和平时时受到威胁。现在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军部队，把美国鬼子打的落花流水，抱头鼠窜，眼看要把这些野狼赶到海里去。它在这种情况下，阴谋要求停战，要求和平解决，实际它是想要喘喘气，重整旗鼓，实行进一步的侵略。用这种阴谋欺骗我们，那是妄想。我们早就看穿了它这种丑像，除非它把全部军队撤出朝鲜去，否则我们就把它打得滚出去，我们准备了足够力量。就拿郑家屯小地方来说，光铁路工人就有二千二百多名志愿参加朝鲜抗美战争。我们要坚决把美帝侵略者赶下海去！不容它有片刻喘息。
