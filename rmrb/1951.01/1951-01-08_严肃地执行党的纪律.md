Seriously Enforce Party Discipline
    Short Commentary
    From the handling of Wang Junjian's case by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party organization of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School, we can see that there are two different attitudes towards the enforcement of discipline within our Party: one is to seriously treat the mistakes of certain Party members, conduct investigations and research, distinguish the nature and impact of their mistakes, and then deal with them in accordance with Party principles. The other is the opposite, deciding on punishment based only on the superficial understanding and emotional impulses of a few people.
    Because the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted the former attitude, it was able to deeply recognize that Wang Junjian's mistake was not a general work-related or ideological mistake committed by an ordinary Party member; but rather an anti-Party, anti-working class, and anti-people counter-revolutionary act. When Wang Junjian failed to achieve his personal goals within the Party, he cursed the Party as "bureaucratic!" "Undemocratic!"... What does all this show? It shows that Wang Junjian is completely a class alien who has infiltrated our Party. Therefore, the Party has only one solution for such an alien element: to expel him from the Party in order to purify the Party organization.
    However, the Party organization of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School adopted an unprincipled attitude towards Wang's mistakes, allowing this class alien to continue to hide within the Party and carry out his counter-revolutionary activities. The reason why the Party organization of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School made this mistake is mainly because it lacked principle and seriousness in handling this issue, and was unable to ruthlessly expel this class alien from the Party in order to maintain the purity of the Party organization, but rather one-sidedly considered issues such as "winning him over" and "reforming" him, believing that this was a "manifestation of petty-bourgeois weaknesses and the influence of reactionary education," and therefore forgave him.
    When punishing a Party member, some local Party organizations often give unprincipled preferential treatment, considering that the Party member has "merit," has "qualifications," "has worked in the Party for ten years," or "has worked for twenty years." Some people who should be punished are not punished, and some people who should be expelled from the Party are not expelled; this is a violation of Party discipline.
    In order to build a Party that is completely unified ideologically, politically, and organizationally, we must oppose this unprincipled erroneous tendency in the enforcement of discipline, and the entire Party should wage a serious struggle against this tendency.

            Expelling Class Alien Wang Junjian
    The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently expelled class alien Wang Junjian. According to the published decision:
    Wang Junjian—a native of Liaoyang County, Northeast China, came from a landlord and capitalist family. He graduated from Peking University. He joined the Party in February 1948; and started working in the same year. He is currently a researcher at the Research Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School.
    When Wang Junjian was studying at school, he admired Hitler and Chiang Kai-shek; and took them as his goals in life. Wang Junjian claimed to have participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League and anti-Soviet demonstrations. Later, because Wang Junjian pretended to be active in the student movement, he infiltrated our Party. After joining the Party, Wang Junjian has always been arrogant and conceited, disregarding Party policies and the interests of the masses, and often undermining the Party's political influence with "leftist" behavior. Although the Party transferred Wang Junjian to the liberated areas for study in July 1948; it was still unable to transform his original ideological consciousness.
    Wang Junjian's main mistakes: (1) Extremely reactionary politically, slandering that "Soviet workers are stupid and uncivilized." He believed that the propaganda in the newspapers about the goodness of socialist construction was "bragging"; on the other hand, he promoted "how civilized the United States is." This is inseparable from Wang Junjian's class background. Therefore, Wang Junjian was carrying out all activities to undermine the Party within the Party. (2) Slandering the working class. Wang Junjian believed that the working class was backward and selfish, and knew nothing. He once slandered that "every female worker wants to be a concubine, and every male worker wants to be a capitalist." Therefore, he believed that the working class was not worthy of being the leading class. He slandered that the Party's claim that the working class is the leading class was putting a tall hat on the working class (meaning a deceptive trick). Wang Junjian believed that Party members from worker and peasant backgrounds were "useless and embarrassing to the Party." He believed that the masses were backward, selfish, and "there is nothing to learn from them." (3) Taking a confrontational attitude towards Party discipline. Wang Junjian demanded that the Party give him fame and status. When the Party could not satisfy his personal desires, he cursed: "What leadership, bureaucratic!" "There is no democracy in the Party," "Big cadres," "small cadres," full of weird remarks. He adopted a two-faced attitude towards the organization and the leadership, being obedient in person but confronting them behind their backs. He also called the Party's call for Party members to play an exemplary role a "restriction" and "trouble."
    Wang Junjian has been in the Party for more than two years. Although the Party has repeatedly given him education on his principled mistakes; Wang Junjian has insisted on not changing, continuing to oppose the Party, oppose the Soviet Union, confront the organization, and confront the leadership; and slander workers, the masses, and comrades, causing great political losses to the Party. All these fully show that Wang Junjian is a class alien. In order to maintain the purity of the Party and recover the Party's influence, this committee has decided to expel him from the Party after deliberation.

    A Review of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School on Handling Wang Junjian's Party Membership Issue (Abstract):
    (1) After the school branch discovered that Wang Junjian had serious errors in his political ideology, it did not analyze in detail the nature of his errors and the extent of their harm to the Party. Wang Junjian's errors were principled; but the branch did not handle them according to Party principles, but rather treated his errors with a liberal attitude. (2) When the branch discussed the punishment for Wang Junjian, it was simply considering the issue of winning him over and reforming him, so although many Party members and the masses in the branch had already raised the opinion that Wang Junjian was "not qualified to be a Party member"; the branch still kept Wang Junjian in the Party. (3) The entire process of handling Wang Junjian's case showed rightist ideological errors. This was because the awareness level of the branch committee comrades was low, and they confused the handling of Wang Junjian with the winning over and reforming of certain non-Party intellectuals. Wang Junjian's behavior was clearly a manifestation of a class alien; but the branch saw it as a manifestation of petty-bourgeois weaknesses and the influence of reactionary education. Therefore, although the branch had recognized that Wang Junjian was a class alien; it could not remove him from the Party according to the principle of removing aliens. This is because the branch emphasized his education and reform, and neglected the purity and unity of the Party. All these are worthy of serious review by the branch.

### 严肃地执行党的纪律

　　严肃地执行党的纪律
    短评
    从中共天津市委纪律检查委员会与全国总工会干部学校党组织对王君健问题的处理中，可以看到在我们党内对纪律的执行，存在两种不同的态度：一种是严肃地对待某些党员的错误，进行调查研究，分别其错误性质、影响，而后按照党的原则进行处理。另一种则与此相反，只凭少数人的一知半解和感情用事，决定处分。
    中共天津市委纪律检查委员会因为采取了前一种态度，所以能够深刻地认识了王君健的错误不是一般党员所犯的工作上的、思想上的错误；而是反党、反工人阶级、反人民的反革命行为。当王君健在党内达不到个人目的时，便谩骂党“官僚！”“不民主！”……这一切说明了什么呢？说明了王君健完全是一个混入我们党内的阶级异己分子。因此，党对这种异己分子就只有一个办法：为纯洁党的组织而将其开除出党。
    但是全国总工会干部学校党组织却对王的错误采取了毫无原则的态度，让这个阶级异己分子继续隐藏在党内，进行他的反革命行为。全总干校党组织所以发生这一错误，主要是因为在处理这一问题时缺乏原则性与严肃性，不能够为了保持党的组织上的纯洁，无情地把这个阶级异己分子开除出党，而是片面地考虑对他“争取”“改造”等问题，认为这是一种“小资产阶级的劣根性及受反动派教育的影响的表现”而加以原谅。
    若干地方党组织在对一个党员进行处分时，常常考虑这个党员有“功劳”，有“资格”，“曾经在党内工作过十年”，“工作过二十年”，而给以无原则的照顾。有些人应该进行处分的没有进行处分，应该开除党籍的没有开除党籍；这是违背党的纪律的。
    为了建设一个思想上、政治上、组织上完全统一的党，必须反对这种执行纪律中的毫无原则的错误偏向，全党应该与这种倾向作严重的斗争。
            开除阶级异己分子王君健
    中共天津市委纪律检查委员会最近开除了阶级异己分子王君健。据公布的决定中称：
    王君健——东北辽阳县人，出身于地主兼资本家家庭。毕业于北京大学。一九四八年二月入党；同年参加工作。现为全国总工会干部学校研究室研究员。
    王君健在校读书时，就崇拜希特勒、蒋介石；并以它们为自己的奋斗目标。王君健自称参加过三青团，参加过反苏游行。后来因为王君健在学生运动中，假装积极，混入我们党内。王君健入党后，一贯自高自大，不顾党的政策，不顾群众利益，常常以“左”的行为破坏党的政治影响。党虽然在一九四八年七月曾将王君健调至解放区学习；但仍未能够改造他的原来的思想意识。
    王君健的主要错误：（一）政治上极端反动，诬蔑“苏联工人愚蠢不文明”。他认为报上宣传社会主义建设好是“吹牛皮”；另一方面他宣扬“美国如何文明”。这是与王君健的阶级出身分不开的。因此王君健在党内进行着一切破坏党的活动。（二）对工人阶级进行诬蔑。王君健认为工人阶级是落后自私的，什么都不懂，他曾诬蔑“那个女工都想当姨太太，那个男工都想当资本家”。因此他认为工人阶级不配为领导阶级。他诬蔑党所说的工人阶级为领导阶级，那是给工人阶级戴高帽子（意思是欺骗手段）。王君健认为工农出身的党员“没用处，给党丢人”。对于群众，他认为落后，自私，“没有什么可以学习的”。（三）对党的纪律采取对抗态度。王君健要求党给以名誉、地位。当党不能满足他的个人欲望时，他就谩骂：“什么领导，官僚！”“党内不民主”，“大干部”“小干部”，怪话连篇。他对组织、对领导采取两面态度，当面服从背后对抗。他并把党号召党员起模范作用，叫做是“束缚”与“麻烦”。
    王君健入党已二年多，虽然党对他的这种原则性的错误曾一再给予教育；但王君健坚持不改，继续反党、反苏、对抗组织、对抗领导；对工人，对群众，对同志进行诬蔑，使党在政治上受到很大损失。这些都充分地说明了王君健是一个阶级异己分子。为了保持党的纯洁性，挽回党的影响，经本会研究，故决定开除其党籍。
    附：
    中华全国总工会干部学校对处理王君健党籍问题的检讨（摘要）：
    （一）学校支部发现王君健在政治思想上存有严重的错误后，没有详细分析其错误性质及其对党的危害程度。王君健错误是原则性的；但支部却未按党的原则处理，而是以自由主义的态度对待其错误。（二）支部在讨论对王君健处分时，是单纯的考虑对其争取改造问题，所以虽然支部内有不少党员群众已提出王君健“不够党员资格”的意见；但支部仍然把王君健留在党内。（三）处理王君健问题整个过程表现了有右的思想错误。这是由于支委同志们的觉悟程度低，把对王君健的处理和对争取改造某些党外知识分子混同了起来。王君健的行为明明是个阶级异己分子的表现；但支部却看成是小资产阶级劣根性及受反动教育影响的表现。因此支部虽然也曾认识到王君健是阶级异己分子；但却不能按照清除异己分子的原则去把他清除出党。这是支部强调了对其教育改造，而忽视了党的纯洁与统一之故。这都是值得支部严肃检讨的。
