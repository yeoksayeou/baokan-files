　　A New Year Should Have New Inventions
    Liu Xianting, National Model Worker Representative of Fuxin Coal Mine

    I will never forget the love I received at the National Congress of Labor Heroes and Model Workers, and the glorious task that Chairman Mao gave us. Chairman Mao instructed us: "China must establish a strong national defense force and a strong economic power. These are two major tasks." After returning to the mine, I emphasized this point to the broad masses of workers. In the patriotic production competition, we always kept Chairman Mao's words in mind. We worked selflessly and tirelessly, brought our enthusiasm and creativity into full play, and technical personnel and workers worked together to successfully create an iron bar sieve, which restored the water washing machine that had been out of production for six years in our factory. This will create a large amount of wealth for the country. The repaired water washing machine has an operating capacity that exceeds the level of the puppet Manchukuo. It can wash 700 tons of coal per day, saving more than 98 million yuan in materials and labor costs. Washing one million tons per year can save more than 140 billion yuan (Northeast currency). The resumption of production of the water washing machine was achieved through two different improvements and creations. This process demonstrated the unity and close cooperation between technical personnel and workers, overcoming various difficulties in the work to achieve the expected goal. Here, we have gained a valuable experience: earnestly uniting technical personnel and closely connecting with workers, everyone working together, constantly researching, and bringing into play the collective strength, so that technology can be continuously improved. Now the 1951 construction tasks have begun. Based on the work experience of 1950, we have decided to establish a technical research committee to further improve the existing coal washing results. Our specific work plan for 1951 is: (1) Invent an automatic loading machine that can load two cars per hour, improve loading efficiency, and save manpower. (2) Repair two 3KW reduction ratios that are 70% broken to supplement current needs. (3) The cylinders of the mine's locomotives and air pumps have been in disrepair for many years and need to be newly installed. Because there is no cylinder boring machine, it is impossible to start new manufacturing. Ordering one from abroad would cost 6 billion yuan. To solve this problem, we have decided to trial-produce a cylinder boring machine. If successful, we plan to make three, which can solve the problems of the entire mine.

    I have strong confidence that these tasks will be completed in 1951, because we all clearly understand our serious responsibilities. We know that the factory is the battlefield, and our creations, inventions, and achievements in our work are a powerful counterattack against the aggressor, American imperialism.

　　新的一年要有新发明
    阜新煤矿全国劳模代表  刘献廷
    我永远也不能忘记，在全国英模代表大会上所受到的热爱和毛主席给我们的光荣任务，毛主席指示我们：“中国必须建立强大的国防军，必须建立强大的经济力量，这是两件大事。”我回矿以后，在广大职工群众中着重传达了这一点。在爱国主义生产竞赛中，我们时时记着毛主席的话，我们奋不顾身地忘我劳动，发挥自己的积极性和创造性，技术人员与工友同心合力，创造铁棍筛子成功，使我厂停废了六年的水洗机恢复生产，将给国家创造大量财富。修复的水洗机，操作能力超过伪满水平，用它每天可选七百吨煤，可节省材料、人工费用九千八百余万元，年选一百万吨可节省一千四百余亿元（东北币）。水洗机的恢复生产，是经过我们两次不同的改进和创造成功的，这中间曾表现出技术人员与工友的团结和密切合作，克服了工作中的种种困难，才达到预期的目的。——这里，我们得到一个宝贵经验，就是认真的团结技术人员和密切连系工友，大家共同努力，不断研究，发挥集体的力量，技术就从而不断提高。现在一九五一年建设任务已经开始，我们根据一九五○年的工作经验，决定成立技术研究委员会，把现有选煤成绩再提高一步。一九五一年我们的具体工作计划是：（１）发明一个自动装车机，使它在一小时内能装两辆车，提高装车效率和节省人力。（２）把坏了百分之七十的两台三ＫＷ减速比修复，以补助目前需要。（３）本矿机车和风泵的汽缸，年久失修，需要新装，因无趟缸机而不能从事新制，向国外订货一台需款六十亿元，为解决这一问题，我们决定试作趟缸机，成功后拟作三台，可以解决全矿问题。
    我具有坚强信心，要把这些工作在一九五一年完成，因为我们大家都清楚自己的严重任务，我们知道，工厂就是战场，在工作中我们的创造，发明与收获就是给侵略者美帝国主义以有力回击。
