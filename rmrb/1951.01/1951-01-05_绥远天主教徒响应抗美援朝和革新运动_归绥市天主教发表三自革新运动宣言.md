　　Suiyuan Catholics Respond to Resist America, Aid Korea and the Reform Movement
    Gui Sui City Catholic Church Publishes Three-Self Reform Movement Manifesto
    [Our Newspaper] Suiyuan's Catholic Church, encompassing the three dioceses of Sui Central (Suiyuan), Sui East (Jining), and Sui West (Ningxia) with over 120,000 believers (the vast majority being rural farmers), is currently launching a Three-Self Reform Movement in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.

    On December 19th, Catholic figures in Gui Sui City convened a symposium attended by over 600 church members. They unanimously expressed their determination to sever all ties with imperialism, and to promote and implement a patriotic movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. Ma Dianru, Hu Ruhan, Zhao Denglian, and Zhu Qing initiated and published the Gui Sui City Catholic Church Three-Self Reform Movement Manifesto. The participating church members unanimously endorsed and approved it by a show of hands. The manifesto stated: "We church members are also Chinese people, and the vast majority of us are impoverished working people. We are resolutely unwilling to be slaves of American imperialism. We will rise up alongside the people of the entire nation, resolutely oppose American imperialism, overthrow American imperialism, not rely on it, not collude with it, and eradicate erroneous thinking of pro-Americanism, worship of America, and fear of America. We must regenerate ourselves through our own effort, establish a church of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. We will absolutely not allow American imperialism to contaminate the sanctity of our church.

    From now on, we must intensify our studies and heighten our vigilance. Furthermore, we must report, inform, expose, and shatter all of American imperialism's conspiracies and activities. This is our collective will and determination.

    Now, the flames of aggression of American imperialism have already been ignited on our Northeastern border, with planes bombing our peaceful cities, killing and wounding our innocent compatriots. We are heartbroken, we are indignant! We must demand repayment in blood. We must stand on the same front as the people of the entire nation and actively support the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country with practical actions."

    Currently, the Suiyuan Catholic Church, with its 120,000 to 130,000 believers, is conducting a broad and in-depth Three-Self Reform Movement in all dioceses based on the spirit of this manifesto. (Yang Mingjie)

　　绥远天主教徒响应抗美援朝和革新运动
    归绥市天主教发表三自革新运动宣言
    【本报讯】绥远的天主教绥中（绥远）、绥东（集宁）、绥西（宁夏）三个教区十二万余教徒（乡村农民占绝大部分），目前正结合抗美援朝运动展开三自革新运动。
    十二月十九日，归绥市的天主教人士，召开了一个座谈会，参加的教友有六百多人。他们一致表示要与帝国主义断绝一切关系，宣传并实行自治、自传、自养的爱国运动。并由马殿如、胡濡翰、赵登廉、朱清四人发起，发表了归绥市天主教三自革新运动宣言。与会教友一致表示拥护，并举手通过。宣言中说：“我们教友也是中国人民，而且绝大多数是贫苦的劳动人民，我们决不甘心作美帝国主义的奴隶，我们要同全国人民一齐奋起，坚决反对美帝国主义，打倒美帝国主义，不依赖他，不勾结他，并且要肃清亲美、崇美、恐美的错误思想。我们要自立更生，建立自治、自养、自传的教会。绝不让美帝国主义沾污我们教会的圣洁。
    今后我们要加紧学习，提高警觉。更要检举、告密、揭穿、粉碎美帝的一切阴谋活动，这是我们大家共同的意志与决心。
    现在美帝国主义的侵略战火已燃到了我东北边境，飞机轰炸我和平城市，杀伤我无辜同胞，我们痛心，我们愤恨！我们要讨还血债，我们要和全国人民站在一条战线上积极地以实际行动支持抗美援朝保家卫国的运动。”
    现在，拥有十二万到十三万教徒的绥远天主教，正根据这篇宣言的精神，向各教区进行着广泛而深入的三自革新运动。（杨明洁）
