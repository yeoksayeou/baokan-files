　　[Xinhua News Agency, 12th] According to Vietnam News Agency: From the night of December 25th to the 26th last year, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an offensive against French troops in the Tien An Fortress area of ​​Northeast Vietnam. The People's Army occupied Binh Lieu and the Hong Mo French military stronghold near Binh Lieu and forced the French troops to withdraw from Chu Son and Xi Mei southeast of Dinh Lap. Binh Lieu is located 20 kilometers north of Tien An and 40 kilometers southwest of Mong Cai, and is an important stronghold of the French army on Highway 4. After the People's Army liberated Binh Lieu, they are now advancing towards Tien An and Mong Cai.
    From December 26th to 27th, the People's Army in the Vinh Yen area of ​​North Central Vietnam surrounded and crushed the French 3rd Mobile Group, which attempted to invade Xuan Trach, Lien Son and other places, inflicting heavy casualties on the French army. From the 26th to the 29th on the Phuc An front, the People's Army eliminated ten French military strongholds along Highway 2, 30 kilometers north of Hanoi, including the heavily fortified Da Phuc, Thanh Lang, An Phu, and Huu Binh. In four days of combat, the People's Army annihilated three battalions and two companies of the French army, killing and wounding 1,100 French troops and capturing 700. The captured military supplies were enough to equip a regiment. The French army command in Binh Lieu, Da Phuc and the commanders of the French army in other strongholds were either killed or captured alive.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] TASS, Paris, 10th: The Paris newspaper "l'Humanité," commenting on the situation in Vietnam, pointed out: "Northern Vietnam is almost entirely under the control of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." L'Humanité stated: As General Alessandri, the French High Commissioner for Indochina, has admitted, since the French army's largest stronghold, Binh Lieu, was captured by the Vietnamese People's Army, the French Expeditionary Force has been unable to retake it despite all its efforts. In a recent battle, 453 French Expeditionary Force soldiers were killed and 400 were wounded. Fierce fighting is currently taking place northeast of Tien An. On January 8, the People's Army attacked the French stronghold of Dong Nhu in the area. There is also fighting in Thai Binh province southeast of Hanoi and 20 kilometers north of Hanoi.
