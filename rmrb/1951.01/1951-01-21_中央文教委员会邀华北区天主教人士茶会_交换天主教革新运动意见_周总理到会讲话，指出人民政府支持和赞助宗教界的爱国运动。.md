Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The State Council's Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government invited Catholic figures from North China to a tea party on the afternoon of the 17th to exchange views on the Catholic Reform Movement. The Catholic figures who participated included: Li Junwu (Deputy Vicar of the Cardinal Archbishop's Office), Wang Ruji (Chief Secretary of the Cardinal Archbishop's Office), Qi Yutian (Deputy Director of the Cardinal Archbishop's Office's Religious Affairs Department), Zhang Bide (Bishop of the Zhaoxian Diocese), Lei Zhenxia (Bishop of the Fenyang Diocese), Wu Kezhai, Nie Guoping (Preparatory Committee Members of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association), as well as representatives from dioceses across North China, priests from Catholic churches in Beijing, and principals of Catholic schools, totaling more than 40 people.

After a welcoming speech by Ma Xulun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, Lu Dingyi, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, spoke. He said: Since Christian figures initiated the patriotic Three-Self Reform Movement (self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation) at the end of July last year, 90,000 Christians across the country have signed the reform declaration. The 14th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China, held in Shanghai last October, unanimously passed a resolution to endorse the Christian Reform Declaration and called on Christians across the country to realize the goals of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation with the greatest determination. In the Catholic Church, Catholic believers in Guangyuan, North Sichuan, led by Mr. Wang Liangzu, published a declaration of independent reform movement last November. Subsequently, Catholic believers in the Yangtze River basin and many parts of North China also issued similar declarations. This is a completely legitimate patriotic action. After listing the facts of imperialist aggression against China using religion for the past century, Deputy Director Lu called on Chinese Catholics to unite, sever the relationship between religion and imperialist exploitation, and make Chinese Catholicism a religious undertaking run by the Chinese people themselves. This is the duty of all patriotic Chinese Catholics. Zhang Bide, Li Junwu, Tian Zhikang (Lecturer at Fu Jen Catholic University), Zhang Huai (Professor at Fu Jen Catholic University), and others spoke in succession. Li Junwu said: The People's Government's policy of freedom of religious belief has been fully proven by the facts of the past year. We must support and obey the various policies of the People's Government. Zhang Huai said: We must resolutely oppose imperialism, prevent religion from being used by imperialism, and implement the Three-Self Movement of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. Catholics in Beijing should not lag behind.

During the tea party, Premier Zhou Enlai arrived and spoke. Premier Zhou said: The Three-Self Movement proposed by religious circles should be promoted, and the People's Government will definitely support and sponsor it. This is a patriotic movement of religious circles. Everyone, including Catholics, has a responsibility to love their motherland. Next, Premier Zhou elaborated on three questions: "What kind of country should we love?", "How to love the country?", and "Is there a contradiction between loving the country and 'All believers are one family'?" He said: We must love the people's China, the People's Republic of China. We must break off relations with the enemies who oppose our country, and the line between the enemy and ourselves must be clearly distinguished. Loving the country and "All believers are one family" are not contradictory. The believers mentioned in "All believers are one family" naturally refer to devout believers and good believers. Traitors and scum among believers, such as Judas in ancient times and imperialist elements and their tool Yu Bin in recent times, cannot be regarded as believers. Finally, Premier Zhou said: The self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation of Christianity and Catholicism can be realized. Those who rely on others instead of self-reliance can never become strong, and only those who are self-reliant have a future. Chinese Catholics are capable of running their own churches well. Deputy Director Ma announced at the end of the meeting: The State Council's Cultural and Educational Committee has established a Religious Affairs Office, with He Chengxiang and Xu Ying serving as director and deputy director respectively, specializing in handling religious affairs. It is hoped that religious circles can frequently contact the government and exchange views with each other in the future. Finally, Li Junwu, on behalf of the Catholics present, expressed his gratitude to the government for the reception. He also said: We should keep Premier Zhou's instructions firmly in mind and convey them to every Catholic believer. The tea party ended in a warm atmosphere.

　　中央文教委员会邀华北区天主教人士茶会
    交换天主教革新运动意见
    周总理到会讲话，指出人民政府支持和赞助宗教界的爱国运动。
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府政务院文教委员会于十七日下午邀请华北区天主教人士举行茶话会，交换对天主教革新运动的意见。参加的天主教人士有：李君武（枢机主教公署副主教）、王汝楫（枢机主教公署秘书主任）、齐吁天（枢机主教公署教务处副主任）、张弼德（赵县教区主教）、雷震霞（汾阳教区主教）、吴克斋、聂国屏（天津市天主教革新运动促进会筹备会筹备委员）以及华北各地教区代表，北京市天主教堂神父，天主教各学校校长等四十余人。
    茶话会在文教委员会马叙伦副主任致开会词后，由文教委员会陆定一副主任讲话。他说：自去年七月底基督教人士发起自治、自养、自传的爱国革新运动后，全国已有九万基督教徒在革新宣言上签名。去年十月间在上海举行的中华全国基督教协进会第十四届年会，一致通过决议拥护基督教革新宣言，号召全国基督教徒以最大决心实现自治、自养、自传的目标。在天主教方面，川北广元以王良佐先生为首的天主教徒在去年十一月发表了自立革新运动宣言，接着，长江流域和华北许多地方的天主教徒也纷纷发表同样的宣言，这是完全正当的爱国行动。陆副主任在列举了一百年来帝国主义利用宗教对中国进行侵略的事实后，号召中国的天主教徒应该团结起来，割断宗教被帝国主义利用的关系，使中国的天主教成为由中国人民自办的宗教事业，这是一切爱国的中国天主教徒的职责。继由张弼德、李君武、田志康（辅仁大学讲师）、张怀（辅仁大学教授）等相继讲话。李君武说：人民政府的信仰自由的政策，已由一年来的事实完全证明，我们要拥护和服从人民政府的各项政策。张怀说：我们要坚决反对帝国主义，要使宗教不为帝国主义利用，实行自治、自养、自传的三自运动。北京市的天主教徒不应落于人后。
    在茶话会进行中，周恩来总理莅临讲话。周总理说：宗教界提出来的三自运动是应该提倡的，人民政府定加以支持和赞助。这是宗教界的爱国运动。爱自己的祖国人人有责，包括天主教徒在内。接着，周总理就“爱什么样的国”、“如何爱国”和“爱国是否和‘天下教友是一家’有矛盾”等三个问题作了详尽的阐述。他说：我们要爱人民的中国，爱中华人民共和国。我们要和反对我们国家的敌人断绝关系，敌我界限必须分清。爱国和“天下教友是一家”是并不矛盾的。“天下教友是一家”中所说的教友，当然是指虔诚的教徒善良的教友而言，教徒中的叛徒败类远者如犹大近者如帝国主义分子及其工具于斌之流当然不能算作教友。最后，周总理说：基督教和天主教的自治、自养、自传是能够实现的。凡依靠人家而不靠自力更生的决不能自强，凡自立者才有前途。中国的天主教徒是有能力办好自己的教会的。马副主任在结束会议时宣布：政务院文教委员会已设立宗教事务处，由何成湘、徐盈分任处长副处长专司宗教事务的处理，希望今后宗教界能经常与政府接触，互相交换意见。最后，李君武代表到会的天主教徒，对政府的招待表示感谢。并说：我们对于周总理的指示，应该牢牢记住，并且应该传达给天主教的每个教友。茶话会在热烈的气氛中结束。
