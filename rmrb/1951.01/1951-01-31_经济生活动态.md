    Certain Cooperatives in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, Have Shortcomings in Their Work

    Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, has a total of four district federations and eighty-one village cooperatives. There are widespread and serious phenomena of arrears, waste, and sluggish supply and marketing in rural supply and marketing work.

The cooperatives in the county should pay attention to correcting the above shortcomings in order to achieve the purpose of serving the members and vigorously exchanging materials.
