　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The Philippine People's Liberation Army has recently launched active operations to combat the "encirclement and suppression" of the Philippine puppet government army. According to an Associated Press report from Manila: The Philippine People's Liberation Army launched attacks in three regions of Central Luzon. On the night of the 12th, the Philippine People's Liberation Army occupied the city of Santa Ignacia in Tarlac Province, north of Manila, and stayed in the city for seven hours. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army once attacked Hermosa City in Bataan Province, blocking two puppet troops attempting to reinforce Hermosa, destroying three vehicles. The Philippine People's Liberation Army, in an attack on Nueva Ecija Province, wounded several puppet police and captured two. At the same time, the Philippine People's Liberation Army attacked the city of Tuy in Batangas Province, south of Manila, killing two puppet police and wounding five.
    The intensified activities of the Philippine People's Liberation Army have made the Philippine puppet army, which is "suppressing the anti-Japanese army," panic. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Manila: At noon on the 10th, two units of the Philippine puppet army mistakenly identified each other as "anti-Japanese army" and fought in the town of Muan Tor in Tarlac Province, resulting in eight deaths and twelve injuries. The commander of the two puppet troops, Major Gazmin, has been removed from his post and is under investigation.

　　菲解放军主动作战在中吕宋胜利出击
    【新华社十三日讯】菲律宾人民解放军最近以主动的作战，打击菲律宾伪政府军的“围剿”。据美联社马尼拉消息透露：菲人民解放军在中吕宋的三个地区发动进攻。十二日夜，菲解放军攻占了马尼拉以北丹辘省的圣太依格纳西亚城，在城内停留七小时。解放军另一部曾攻入巴丹省赫摩沙城，阻击了企图增援赫摩沙的两支伪军，击毁汽车三辆。菲解放军在袭击新怡西夏省时，击伤伪警多名，俘虏二名。菲解放军同时在马尼拉南袭击了八打雁省的图伊城，击毙伪警两名，击伤五名。
    菲解放军的加紧活动，使“进剿民抗军”的菲伪军惶惶不安。据法新社马尼拉讯：十日正午，菲伪军有两支部队彼此误认为“民抗军”，在丹辘省墨安托镇打了起来，结果有八人被击毙，十二人受伤。该两支伪军的指挥官加兹明少校，已被撤职查办。
