The "Common Soldier" of Korea
    Jin Wanxian, Original Work, Cui Bin, Abridged Translation
    Editor's Note: "A 'Common Soldier' of Korea" is a story depicting how a Korean People's Army engineering squad leader heroically sacrificed himself to save five tanks. Comrade Li Yunzhi's spirit of heroic sacrifice to defend the motherland is a brilliant example of the heroic Korean people. The original, totaling 8,000 characters, was serialized as a novel in the "Democratic Korea" newspaper on December 16th and 17th, 1950.

    The American troops continued to retreat. However, judging from information gathered from various sources, the enemy was preparing a stubborn resistance by utilizing the high ground on the other side of the mountains. On both sides were steep mountains, and the only way forward was a path through the middle of these mountains, a terrain clearly disadvantageous to us. However, the situation required our army to overcome any difficulties and seize the enemy-occupied high ground before dawn.

    Therefore, the Fourth Engineering Squad, in order to ensure the advance of our mechanized forces, needed to remove all obstacles laid by the enemy on the road and had to complete this before dawn. The task was so heavy, and the time so pressing.

    The Fourth Engineering Squad formed two horizontal rows, holding mine detectors resembling fire pokers in their hands, and began probing while bending over. The squad of eleven men advanced, meticulously probing along the mountain road.

    "Found one!"

    Squad Leader Li heard a tense but low voice beside him. At that moment, Squad Leader Li's hand holding the mine detector also felt a strong reaction.

    Over there, someone also shouted:

    "There's one here too!"

    "Quiet, be quiet!"

    After digging them out, they began to disarm the mines. These were anti-personnel mines. In a short period of time, they disarmed about twenty mines. Everyone's uniform pockets were filled with three or four detonators taken from the anti-personnel mines.

    They began even more meticulous probing work... Enemy mortar shells flew overhead and landed behind the mountain ridge.

    The mine detector tightened on Squad Leader Li's hand again. Here and there, the shouts of "Found one!", "Found one!" were heard again.

    The enemy had laid countless mines in this area. They dug a few times with their iron shovels and then lay prone on the ground. Suddenly, the enemy began a fierce machine gun barrage in this direction. Undoubtedly, they had been discovered. The fierce firing of our heavy machine gun company began from the mountain behind. Squad Leader Li, holding an automatic rifle, also fired at the enemy for a long time. He suddenly stopped firing because he remembered what the company commander had said: "Before dawn..."

    "Comrades! Cheer up! Cheer up!" In the darkness, he heard short, urgent calls and the sound of someone falling to the ground. Squad Leader Li immediately knew that a comrade had been sacrificed. The sounds of machine guns and rifles became more intense.

    "Continue disarming!" the squad leader ordered. The members began probing again. This time, the mines were anti-tank mines, and disarming them took considerable time.

    "Ah!" Another member fell.

    "Work quickly!" Squad Leader Li shouted again.

    At that moment, the sound of tank tracks turning came from the mountain bay behind. The squad leader abruptly turned his head to look.

    One tank, two tanks, three tanks; no, there were more behind them. Enemy shells exploded beside the tanks.

    "They're our tanks! Hurry! Hurry!" Squad Leader Li suddenly stood up and shouted loudly. He knew that the scheduled time had already passed. Squad Leader Li immediately felt that the situation was very urgent. Although about twenty mines had been disarmed, he did not know how many more mines were still buried on the road. But the tanks were advancing at full speed.

    What to do? From 200 meters, 180 meters... the distance to the tanks was getting shorter and shorter. Squad Leader Li raised his automatic rifle and fired a few shots into the air, but the tanks continued to advance.

    "Stop!"

    "Stop!"

    He waved the iron shovel in his hand and shouted like mad. The two soldiers beside him also waved their hands and shouted loudly along with Squad Leader Li. But it was all in vain. 150 meters... 120 meters... the tanks were still advancing.

    "Use flares!"

    But the flares wouldn't light. There was only one person with matches during the break just now, and everyone was anxiously looking for matches, but no one answered. It seemed that the soldier had already been sacrificed.

    Alas! The tanks were almost upon them.

    The distance was only fifty meters... no, already thirty meters.

    Squad Leader Li suddenly opened his coat, and a few buttons fell off. The coat was unbuttoned, and Squad Leader Li tightly grasped the small square cloth bag hanging on his chest, while shouting:

    "Comrades, quickly hide far away!" He stamped hard with his heel a few times on the not-yet-completely-dug-out mine.

    There was no reaction.

    He knocked on the mine with the iron shovel, but there was still no reaction.

    Only then did the soldiers realize what the squad leader was doing.

    The tanks had to be saved, but there was no time to hide if they were going to save the tanks. They had no choice but to hide by the side of the road.

    The tanks were only twenty meters away...

    Squad Leader Li took out the hand grenade from his waist, opened the cover, pulled the pin, and threw it forcefully under his feet. But he didn't run; on the contrary, he covered the mine pit with his body, afraid of hurting the soldiers who didn't have time to escape.

    In that instant, along with a booming sound, a fiery red pillar of fire rose into the sky.

    The tanks that had been advancing so bravely stopped with a crash just a few meters away.

    In this way, five tanks were saved.

    Also, because of this heroic sacrifice, our army successfully seized the enemy-occupied high ground at dawn. The enemy abandoned the high ground and retreated south.

    A soldier of the Fourth Engineering Squad, named Jin, was eagerly searching for something near the mine explosion site.

    It was already fully light. He was turning over the soil piled up by the mine explosion with his iron shovel, also moving the stones, looking, searching. He had been turning over the piles of soil and stones like this for more than half an hour.

    He suddenly saw a human hand sticking out in front. He hurriedly ran over there.

    But it wasn't a corpse, but an arm severed from the root, already frozen on the ground.

    But strangely, a piece of black cloth was tightly held in that hand.

    Soldier Jin managed to pull out that piece of cloth. Ah! It wasn't a piece of cloth, but a small square cloth bag. He then turned over the bag, and he turned out a small book decorated with green cloth. Ah! This was the party membership card of a Labor Party member.

    In the name column of the party card, he could see the three clear characters written in ink: Li Yunzhi.

　　朝鲜的“普通一兵”
    金万善  原作  崔彬  摘译
    编者按：“朝鲜的“普通一兵””，是一篇描写朝鲜人民军一个工兵分队长以自己的英勇牺牲救援了五辆坦克的故事。李允植同志的这种为保卫祖国而英勇牺牲的精神，是英雄的朝鲜人民的光辉典范。原文长达八千字，是以小说形式连载于一九五○年十二月十六、十七两日的“民主朝鲜”报上。
    美军继续在后退着。但综合各方面情报来判断，敌人正在利用前边山岭那面的高地准备着顽强的抵抗。两边都是险峻的高山，要前进只有这高山中间的一条路，地势分明是对我们不利的。但是情况需要我军克服任何困难在天明之前夺取敌军占据着的高地。
    因此第四工兵分队为了保证我们机械化部队的前进，需要排除敌人在路上所敷设的一切障碍物，并必须在天明之前要完成。任务是如此之重，而时间又如此紧迫。
    第四工兵分队排成两个横列，手里拿着火筷子样的探雷器，弯着腰开始探测。分队共十一个人前进着，细密地沿着山坡的道路探测。
    “有了！”
    李分队长听见了旁边紧张的但是压低了的声音。就在这时刻，李分队长握着探雷器的手也感到了有力的反应。
    在那边也喊：
    “这儿也有！”
    “静一点，静静罢！”
    挖出以后，开始处理地雷。这是步兵地雷。他们在短短的时间之内处理了二十来个地雷。每人的军衣口袋里都装上了三、四个刚由步兵地雷上弄下来的雷管。
    他们又开始了更细密的探测工作………敌人的迫击炮弹飞过上空落到山岭后面去了。
    探雷器又拉紧着李分队长的手。在这里和那里又听见“有了！”，“有了！”的喊声。
    敌人在这一带敷设了无数地雷。他们拿铁铣刨了几下后都伏在地上了。敌人突然猛烈地向这儿用机枪扫射。无疑，被敌人发现了。我们的重机枪中队的猛烈的射击由后边山地开始了。李分队长拿着自动步枪也向敌人射击了好半天。他突然停止射击，因为他想起了中队长说的：“在天明之前……”这一句话。
    “同志！振作精神罢！振作精神！”在黑暗中听见了短急的叫声和应声倒地的声音，李分队长立刻知道已牺牲了一个同志。机枪、步枪的声音更加激烈起来了。
    “继续解除工作！”分队长下了命令。队员们又开始探测了。这次的地雷是反坦克地雷，处理这地雷相当费时间。
    “啊！”又倒下去了一个队员。
    “迅速进行工作！”李分队长又喊了一声。
    就在这时候，由后面山湾传来了坦克车齿带转动的声音。分队长猛地转过脸看了一看。
    一辆，两辆，三辆；不，在那后边还有几辆。敌人的炮弹在坦克旁边爆炸了。
    “是我们的坦克！快点！快点！”李分队长忽地站起来高喊起来了。他知道了预定的时间已经过去了。李分队长立刻感到情况非常紧急。因为被解除的地雷虽已有二十来个，但他不知道尚有多少地雷还埋在道路上。可是坦克车以全速度在前进着。
    怎么办？由二百公尺，一百八十公尺………与坦克之间的距离越来越缩短着。李分队长举起自动步枪向空中放了几枪，但坦克仍在前进。
    “站！”
    “站住！”
    他挥着拿铁铣的手疯了似的喊。旁边的两个战士，也跟着李分队长挥着手高喊起来了。但是都没有用。一百五十公尺………一百二十公尺………坦克依然在前进着。
    “拿洋火信号罢！”
    但是洋火始终没有点着。刚才休息时候有洋火的人只有一个，大家这样急着找洋火，但是没有人应答。由此看来，那个战士已经牺牲了。
    嗳呀！坦克已经快到眼前了。
    距离只有五十公尺，……不，已经三十公尺了。
    李分队长突然拉开了上衣，掉下来几个扣子。上衣解开了，李分队长紧紧握住了挂在胸前的四角的小布袋，同时喊着：
    “同志们赶快躲到远一点的地方去！”他一面以脚后跟用力地踏了几下还未完全刨出来的地雷。
    没有什么反应。
    他拿铁铣敲了地雷，但也没有什么反应。
    战士们这时候才知道了，分队长在做什么。
    坦克是一定要救的，但是要救坦克就来不及躲。他们就只好躲到路旁去了。
    坦克的距离只有二十公尺了………
    李分队长拿出来了腰间的手榴弹，打开了盖，拉开了引信，向着自己的脚底下猛力地摔去。但他并没跑，相反地以身体盖上了地雷坑，他怕伤害来不及躲避的战士。
    这瞬间，与轰隆隆的声音一起，火红的大火柱升上了天空。
    那样勇猛前进着的坦克，就在几公尺前哗啦地一声停下来了。
    这样救了五辆坦克车。
    也由于这英勇的牺牲，在天刚拂晓的时候，我军顺利地夺取了敌军占据着的高地。敌人放弃了高地，向南溃退了。
    工兵第四分队的一个姓金的战士，在地雷爆炸过的附近热心地找着什么东西。
    天已经全亮了。他以铁铣翻着地雷爆炸时堆起来的土，也搬动着石头，看着，找着。他这样翻动土堆和石头已经半个多钟头了。
    他忽然看见了在前边露出来的有一只人的手。他慌忙的跑到那边去了。
    但那不是尸首，而是由臂根断下来的一只胳膊，已经冻结在地上。
    但是奇怪的很，不知是什么黑色的布片紧紧地握在那只手里。
    金战士好容易拉出来那块布片，啊！原来不是布片，而是四角的小布袋。他接着翻了布袋子，他翻出来了以绿色布装修的一个小本。啊！这是劳动党党员的党证。
    在党证的姓名栏上，看出来了用墨写的鲜明的李允植三个字。
