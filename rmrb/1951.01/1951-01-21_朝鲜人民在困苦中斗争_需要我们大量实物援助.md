　　Korean People Struggle in Hardship
    Need for Massive Material Aid
    [Beijing reader Zhao Xinfa asks:] Recently, the China Peace Committee issued a notice on launching a campaign nationwide to慰劳 (comfort and support) the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army and to provide relief to Korean refugees. Besides calling for 慰劳 (comfort and support) to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, it also pointed out that the Korean people, suffering under the蹂躏 (trampling) of the American invaders and their running dogs, lack clothing, food, and housing in the severe winter. It specifically initiated the collection of material goods for relief. Could you please explain the current difficult situation of the Korean people in detail?
    [Answer:] The aggressive war waged by the American imperialists in Korea is far more brutal than the past aggression of Japanese imperialism against our country, implementing a policy of destruction without any humanity. From the outbreak of the war on June 25th last year to the present, in more than half a year, the material constructions on the vast land of Korea have been seriously damaged by the American and Li bandits. Many previously prosperous cities have now become ruins.
    At the beginning of this month, the Korean Democratic Women's League issued an appeal to women worldwide, painfully pointing out: "People can no longer use maps and books from six months ago to study Korea. Some places marked as cities and villages on the map six months ago have disappeared without a trace. Where there were houses, there are now none. Where fruit trees and forests were planted, there is nothing left, only bare mountains, rocks, and riverbeds. Those places bombed and strafed by American planes are neither trenches nor artillery positions. They are peaceful cities and villages where workers, peasants, and staff live."
    American imperialism not only carried out large-scale massacres but also large-scale destruction, attempting to make it impossible for the living to continue living. Therefore, American planes not only brutally kill peaceful residents but also destroy all living facilities of the Korean people. According to the admission of the American imperialist news agency Associated Press, within 117 days after the outbreak of the war, American planes dropped a total of 35,000 tons of bombs and 850,000 gallons of gasoline for burning houses.
    According to the report of Kim Se-gwang, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross, when American planes bombed Manpo, one plane first flew in to scatter gasoline, and then a large number of bombers came to drop incendiary bombs, instantly burning down most of the houses. When enemy planes bombed Sinuiju, they used an even more cruel method. American planes first bombed and burned the surrounding border areas with gasoline and incendiary bombs, and then tightened the bombing towards the central area, leaving only a few intact houses in the center of the city after the bombing.
    His report pointed out that the iron hooves of the invading army had trampled across most of the land of Korea. Although the American and Li bandit troops are continuously retreating, they have created disasters in all areas. Tens of thousands of innocent peaceful residents wander in the streets, enduring hunger and cold.
    The heinous crimes of the American invaders in destroying peaceful towns and villages in Korea have been admitted even by the reporter of the American reactionary news agency United Press. United Press reporter Moore reported from Tokyo on January 7th that Koreans "have their homes destroyed, and often more than once. After the factories are destroyed, they have no work to do." They and their families in the front lines or in the areas ruled by the American and Li bandits "have become ragged, hungry, and cold wanderers." Who has subjected these peaceful residents to such disasters? Moore admitted: "The Americans did it." Moore said that the American invading army and its accomplice troops, "whether retreating or advancing," must "bomb and burn many towns in North Korea and virtually all of its industry."
    The lack of food among the Korean people can be understood from the following facts:
    The American imperialist invasion of Korea took place in June, and the crops in the Korean fields had not yet been harvested. Because the American imperialists treated peaceful villages as bombing targets, a large number of farmhouses and agricultural implements were destroyed. According to Kim Se-gwang's report, most of the crops in the fields of North Korea had not been harvested by November. According to the report of the Korean Democratic Women's League: "The rice that our people had worked hard to plant with their frugal hands had not yet been harvested in the fields, but the granaries had been burned to ashes."
    The Northeast Daily published a letter on January 7th from Yu Lie, a staff member of an engineering company of our People's Volunteer Army, which stated: "The houses of these Korean folks have been destroyed by American planes. Therefore, many people currently have no cotton clothes to wear and no food to eat. Many children follow us, crying from the cold. At this time, we all gave our woolen clothes, woolen trousers, shirts, and socks to the Korean folks."
    According to recent news from the liberated areas of Korea, the Korean people are actively launching extensive reconstruction and relief work with the strong assistance of the Republic government, so that refugees can get food and cloth, receive houses or building materials, and the injured can get free medical treatment. However, as the People's Daily editorial in Beijing on the 15th of this month said: "The destruction of American imperialism in Korea is unprecedentedly barbaric and unprecedentedly tragic. Many towns and villages have become ruins, and millions of Korean people are today in a tragic situation of hunger, cold, destitution, and displacement."..."The more victorious the war is, the more people need relief, and the wider the area. Therefore, at a time when most of Korea has been liberated and the climate is the coldest, it is absolutely necessary for the China Peace Committee to launch a large-scale campaign across China to collect grain, cotton, cloth, and cash."

### 朝鲜人民在困苦中斗争  需要我们大量实物援助

　　朝鲜人民在困苦中斗争
    需要我们大量实物援助
    【北京读者赵新发问】最近中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会发出关于在全国发起慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并救济朝鲜难民的通知，除号召慰劳英勇作战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军外，并指出朝鲜人民因受美国侵略者及其走狗蹂躏，在寒冬时缺乏衣被粮食房屋，特别发起募集实物，进行救济，请问朝鲜人民目前困难情形究竟如何？请作具体说明。
    【答】美帝国主义者在朝鲜所进行的侵略战争，其凶残程度远甚于过去日本帝国主义对我国的侵略，毫无人性地实行毁灭政策。从去年六月二十五日战争爆发到现在，半年多的时间内，朝鲜境内广大土地上的物质建设被美李匪帮严重地破坏了。许多过去繁荣的城市，现在变成了废墟。
    本月初朝鲜民主妇女总同盟发表的致全世界妇女呼吁书曾沉痛地指出：“人们不能够用六个月以前的地图和书籍来研究朝鲜了。六个月前在地图上标志为城市与乡村的若干地方，一点痕迹都没有了。本来有房子的地方，现在没有房子了。本来种植着果树和森林的地方，现在什么都没有了，留下来的只有光光的山、岩石与河床。被美国飞机轰炸和扫射的那些地方，既不是战壕也不是炮兵阵地。那些都是工人、农民和职员居住的和平的城市与乡村。”
    美国帝国主义不仅进行了大规模屠杀，而且进行着大规模的破坏，它企图使活着的人无法再活下去。因此美国飞机不仅残酷地杀害和平居民，而且毁灭朝鲜人民一切生活设施。据美帝国主义的通讯社美联社的供认，战争爆发以后一百十七天之内，美国飞机一共投了三万五千吨炸弹；投下烧房子用的汽油达八十五万加仑。
    据朝鲜红十字会中央委员会副委员长金世光的报告，美机轰炸满浦时，先飞来一架飞机散撒汽油，然后大量的轰炸机再来投烧夷弹，这样一瞬间焚毁了大多数的房屋。而当敌机轰炸新义州时，用了更惨酷的方式。美机用汽油与烧夷弹先炸烧周围的边境地区，然后再往中心区紧缩，炸后在市区中心只剩下几座完整的房子。
    他的报告指出，侵略军的铁蹄曾踏遍了朝鲜大部的土地，现在美李匪军虽连续溃退，但他们却在所有的地区制造了灾难。成千成万的无辜的和平居民彷徨在街道上忍受着饥饿与寒冷。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜破坏和摧毁和平城镇和村庄的万恶罪行，连美国反动通讯社合众社的记者也不得不承认。合众社记者摩尔一月七日自东京发出电讯说：朝鲜人的“家被毁了，而且常常毁了不止一次。在工厂毁了以后，他们已没有工可做”。他们和他们的家属在前线或美、李匪帮统治区“已变成衣服褴褛、饥寒交迫的飘泊者”。谁使这些和平居民横遭如此的灾难呢？摩尔承认：“是美国人干的”。摩尔说：美国侵略军及其帮凶部队“不管是后退或者前进”，都要“炸毁和烧掉北朝鲜的许多城镇以及实际上它的全部工业”。
    朝鲜人民粮食缺乏的情形，可以从下列事实中明了：
    美帝侵朝战事发生在六月间，朝鲜田里的谷物还没有收割。由于美帝把和平乡村也当作轰炸目标，致令大批农舍与农具被毁。据金世光的报告，北朝鲜大部分田里的谷物到十一月都还没有收割。另据朝鲜民主妇女总同盟的报告：“我国人民……用俭朴的双手辛辛苦苦种植起来的稻子，在田里还没有收割，但谷仓已被焚为灰烬了。”
    东北日报在一月七日刊载了我国人民志愿军某部工兵连工作人员于埒的一封信，信里就说到：“这些朝鲜老乡们的家屋都被美机毁坏了，因此，目前许多人没有棉衣穿，没有粮食吃，有许多小孩跟着我们，被冻得直哭。这时我们都纷纷把自己的绒衣、绒裤、衬衣和鞋袜等送给朝鲜老乡。”
    最近由朝鲜解放区传来的消息，朝鲜人民正在共和国政府大力协助下，积极展开广泛的复兴与救济工作，使难民们得到粮食和布匹，领到房屋或建筑材料，受伤者得到免费诊疗。但是，正如本月十五日北京人民日报社论所说：“美帝国主义在朝鲜的破坏，是空前野蛮、空前惨重的。许多城镇乡村成了废墟，千百万的朝鲜人民今天是陷于饥寒交迫、孤苦流离的悲惨境地。”……“战争愈胜利，需要救济的人口愈多，面积愈广。因此，在目前朝鲜大部已经得到解放，而气候最为寒冷的时候，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会发起在全中国大量募集粮食、棉花、布匹和现金，是完全必要的。”（附图片）
