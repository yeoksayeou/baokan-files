Economic Life Trends
    Wanbei Alum Production Sets Unprecedented Record
    Over the past year, alum production in the Wanbei Fanshan mining area reached 15.6 million jin, exceeding the peak period since mining began in the Tang Dynasty by more than 2.2 million jin. This is because the local products company opened up sales channels for alum, allowing investors to have flexible capital turnover and maintaining a reasonable price ratio between grain and alum.
  Suiyuan State-Owned Trading Institutions to Expand
    In order to boost the sales of local products and invigorate the urban and rural economy, the Suiyuan Provincial State-Owned Trading Company has decided to expand its institutions. The plan for this year includes adding three provincial companies for local products, grain, and general merchandise, as well as four branch companies for egg products, fur, cotton yarn, and coal construction materials. It also plans to establish approximately forty branch companies in towns along the railway lines throughout the province, and comprehensive trading companies in remote areas such as the Yi and Wu leagues, and Shanba. This will play a significant role in material exchange.
  Pingyuan Cooperatives Sign Local Product Exchange Contracts
    In order to address the sluggish sales of local products for its members, the cooperatives in various special districts of Pingyuan Province held a meeting in the provincial cooperative last mid-month and signed various local product exchange contracts. The cooperatives in each special district implemented the principle of small profits and large sales, and mutual responsibility for promoting sales during negotiations. Implementing this principle will enable smooth material exchange between friendly cooperatives and between upper and lower-level cooperatives.
  North China Region Overfulfills Waterwheel Production Plan
    The 1950 North China region waterwheel production plan was 80,000 units, and the actual completion was 98,703 units. 66,420 units have been loaned out, accounting for 83% of the original plan. In 1951, the plan is to loan out 59,431 new and existing waterwheels, requiring the expansion of irrigated land by 891,000 mu and an increase in grain production of 35.65 million jin.
  Liaodong and Lushun-Dalian Expand Area of Specialty Crops
    Farmers in Liaodong and Lushun-Dalian are actively planning to expand the area of specialty crops. For example, Xihai District of Gaiping County, Liaodong, planted more than 4,000 mu of cotton last year and can expand to 14,500 mu this year. Thirteen Mile Village in Lushun-Dalian will increase its cotton planting area to 2,800 mu this year, more than three times the area of last year. Many farmers are reserving all their land for economic crops such as cotton, hemp, and peanuts. The provincial and county people's governments are helping them solve the difficulty of insufficient seeds. In order to fully supply industrial raw materials and consolidate national defense, it is necessary to expand the area of specialty crops in specialty crop areas. Farmers' enthusiastic planting of more cotton and hemp is encouraged by the government's correct and reasonable price ratios.
  Shandong Province Actively Promotes Improved Varieties
    In 1950, the Shandong Provincial Seed Company purchased 5.205 million jin of improved wheat varieties, of which some were not up to standard, and actually promoted 5.189 million jin. In addition, the masses in 23 counties in six special districts self-selected 9.490405 million jin of improved varieties. Farmers in Laiyang Special District also selected a total of 18 varieties of crops such as corn, sorghum, millet, and soybeans, which generally have characteristics such as high yield and good quality.
