Xinhua News Agency, 20th. A general strike by Italian workers in various places protesting Eisenhower's arrival in Italy to conduct criminal activities.

The Italian people responded with boiling anger to the criminal activities of the American warmonger Eisenhower in Rome to piece together his aggressive army.

Long before the news of Eisenhower's planned visit to Italy was released, a large-scale protest movement had unfolded throughout Italy. Slogans such as "Eisenhower go home" appeared everywhere in various cities; laboring people in various places successively held strikes and demonstrations; the Italian Committee for the Defense of Peace, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the Italian Communist Youth League, the Rome Labor Association, and others all called on the people to express their firm will to oppose aggression through action. The strength of the Italian people was so great that the government had to flusteredly threaten the people with "severe administrative sanctions and legal sanctions," and when Eisenhower arrived, it took the most severe security measures since the end of the war, dispatching a large number of mechanized military police to patrol every street in Rome.

However, despite all the intimidation and suppression, on January 18, the day after Eisenhower arrived in Rome, the laboring people of Rome launched a powerful lightning general strike at 3:30 in the afternoon; from 4:30, all city traffic was completely stopped for one hour; at 5:00, 200,000 laboring people smashed through the heavy blockade of thousands of military police equipped with American weapons and poured into the rally site, the Corelli Aubio Theater. At the meeting, Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, on behalf of the five million organized workers and all peace-loving people in Italy, announced: "The Italian people want peace!" "The Italian people will never be dragged into war like in 1939 and 1940. They know that the Soviet Union is a great fortress of peace, and they will never carry out the aggressive plans of foreign imperialism!" At this time, people gathered in dozens of streets near the theater, listening to Vittorio's speech through loudspeakers, and shouted in unison: "Peace! Peace! Peace!" After the meeting, the demonstrators lined up in serious and orderly ranks, ignoring all provocative attempts by the large contingent of military police who were facing a formidable enemy, and marched forward singing patriotic songs. Their voices resounded throughout the city of Rome.

In Turin, all workers went on strike for as long as twenty hours. Florence, Naples, Brescia, Vicenza, Padua, Cremona, Palermo, Messina, Taranto, and all towns and cities throughout Italy victoriously held general strikes.

　　抗议艾森豪威尔抵意进行罪恶活动
    意各地劳动人民总罢工
    【新华社二十日讯】综合塔斯社与电通社消息：意大利全国人民以沸腾的愤怒来回答美国战争贩子艾森豪威尔，为拚凑其侵略军而在罗马进行的罪恶活动。
    远在艾森豪威尔拟赴意的消息一传出，意大利全国就展开了大规模的抗议运动。各城市到处出现了“艾森豪威尔滚回去”的标语；各地劳动人民相继举行罢工与示威；意大利保卫和平委员会、意大利总工会、意大利共产主义青年团、罗马劳工协会等，都号召人民以行动表示他们反对侵略的坚强意志。意大利人民的力量是如此强大，以致政府不得不手慌脚乱地以“严厉的行政制裁和法律制裁”来恫吓人民，而在艾森豪威尔到达之际又采取了战争结束以来最严厉的保安措施，出动大批机械化宪警，在罗马每一个街头布岗巡逻。
    然而尽管有这一切的恫吓与镇压，在一月十八日，即艾森豪威尔抵达罗马的次日，罗马劳动人民在下午三点半钟开始举行了强有力的闪击总罢工；从四点半起，全市交通全部停止一小时；五点钟，二十万劳动人民粉碎了数千名以美式武器装备的宪警的重重封锁，涌向抗议大会会场高雷·奥比奥戏院。在会上，意大利总工会总书记维多里奥代表意大利五百万有组织的工人和全意爱好和平的人民宣布：“意大利人民要和平！”“意大利人民决不会像一九三九年与一九四○年那样被卷入战争。他们晓得苏联是伟大的和平堡垒，他们决不奉行外国帝国主义的侵略计划！”这时，齐集在戏院附近几十条街道上通过扩音器聆听维多里奥演说的人们齐声高呼：“和平！和平！和平！”会后，示威者排着严肃、整齐的队伍，不顾如临大敌的大队宪警们一切挑衅的企图，高唱着爱国歌曲，向前迈进。他们的声音响彻了罗马全城。
    在都灵，全体工人都罢工二十小时之久。佛罗伦萨、那不勒斯、布里西亚、比森萨、巴多瓦、克利摩那、巴勒摩、墨西拿、大兰多和全意大利各城镇，都胜利地举行了总罢工。
