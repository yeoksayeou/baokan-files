　　The People and the Government Stand Together
　　Farmers in Zhenxi, Xinjiang, Enthusiastically Deliver Public Grain
Editor:
　　The autumn grain collection work in the Second District of the Eastern Region of Zhenxi County, Xinjiang Province, has concluded victoriously. This is due to the local people's government grasping the correct autumn grain collection policy, implementing the spirit of reasonable burden-sharing, and the effective cooperation of propaganda work. In order to express their warm love for their government, the farmers of the Second District decided to collectively transport the public grain of the entire district into the granary. At midnight on December 23rd, everyone was ready, and groups of high-wheeled carts set off towards the urban area in a mighty procession. The next morning, County Head Qiu personally led more than 1,000 people from various organs, schools, and mass organizations to welcome them in the suburbs. The sound of gongs and drums, singing, slogans, and the laughter of the masses along the street made the whole street lively! Teams of large oxen pulling grain carts surged into the warehouse gate hung with national flags and red banners like lively dragons and tigers. The staff warmly welcomed the villagers with tea and thanked them for their hard work. This incident fully demonstrates that the farmers of Xinjiang and the People's Government stand together.

　　人民和政府站在一道
    新疆镇西农民踊跃缴公粮编辑同志：
    新疆省镇西县东区二乡的秋征工作已胜利结束。这是由于当地人民政府掌握了正确的秋征政策，贯彻了合理负担的精神以及宣传工作的有力配合的结果。二乡农民为了表示热烈爱戴自己的政府，决定把全乡的公粮集体运送入库。十二月二十三日的半夜，大家都准备好了，成群结队的高轮大车，便浩浩荡荡地向城区出发了。次日早晨，邱县长亲率各机关、学校、团体群众一千余人至城郊欢迎。一片锣鼓声、歌声、口号声和沿街群众的欢笑声，闹得满街热火朝天！一队队拖着粮车的大犍牛，生龙活虎似地涌进了挂着国旗和红布标语的仓门。工作人员热情地招待老乡们喝茶，向他们道辛苦。这件事充分地表现出了新疆农民和人民政府是站在一道的。
