    Beijing News Agency Dispatch: With the encouragement and support of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, Beijing's childcare services have rapidly developed over the past year. In the early days of Beijing's liberation, there were only ten public and private nurseries in the city, with a total of about 340 children and just over 100 childcare workers. As of December last year, the number of public and private nurseries in the city had increased to 66, with a total of 2,789 children and 1,646 childcare workers.
    With the successful development of various construction projects, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to concentrate the strength of relevant parties to lead and promote the city's childcare services, invited the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation and other relevant departments, as well as individuals enthusiastic about social welfare, to establish the Maternal and Child Welfare Committee in April last year. This committee regularly inspects, guides, rewards, and assists public and private nurseries throughout the city. First, in May last year, a general physical examination was conducted for all childcare workers in the city. Those with illnesses were assisted in changing jobs or receiving treatment, so as to further guarantee the health of the children in care. During the "June 1st" Children's Day last year, medical workers throughout the city were organized to conduct a general examination of the health of children in nurseries. Subsequently, in July and August last year, a comprehensive inspection was carried out on all private nurseries in the city, assisting them to improve in terms of childcare and education. The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation also frequently organized childcare workers throughout the city to collectively compile teaching materials for nurseries and, together with relevant government departments, frequently invited experts and staff from public and private nurseries to hold various business seminars, exchanging experiences and studying childcare issues.
    In order to encourage individuals enthusiastic about social welfare to establish private nurseries, the Beijing Municipal People's Government awarded flags or bonuses to ten well-run private nurseries in October last year.
    In addition to encouraging people from all walks of life to establish nurseries, opening nurseries in factories and institutions, and seasonal nurseries in rural areas during busy farming seasons, are two practical and feasible ways to widely develop maternal and child welfare services. During the busy farming season in October last year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, Beijing Normal University, and other units, experimentally established seasonal nurseries in four locations in the suburbs of Beijing: Bagou, Liulangzhuang, Machang, and Shijiacun. These nurseries were very popular among farmers, not only allowing rural women to work in production with peace of mind, but also playing a significant role in promoting rural maternal and child health work. Recently, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation has also assisted the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, the Beijing Clothing Factory, and the Beijing People's Printing Factory in experimentally establishing nurseries in institutions and factories, so that mothers participating in various construction projects only need to spend a minimal amount of time breastfeeding their babies, while all other care and education matters are handled by childcare workers, enabling mothers to continue working as usual.

    京市保育事业迅速发展
    【本报讯】京市新闻处讯：京市儿童保育事业一年多来在京市人民政府的鼓励和扶植下已获得迅速进展。北京解放初期，全市公、私立托儿所只有十处，受托儿童共约三百四十人，保育工作人员也仅有一百多人。截至去年十二月止，全市公、私立托儿所增至六十六处，受托儿童总数达二千七百八十九人，保育工作人员也增达一千六百四十六人。
    随着各项建设事业的胜利发展，京市人民政府为了集中有关方面的力量领导并推动全市儿童保育事业，于去年四月邀请京市民主妇女联合会等有关部门与热心社会福利事业的人士成立了妇幼福利委员会，经常对全市公、私立托儿所进行检查、辅导、奖励和协助。首先，在去年五月，对全市保育工作者普遍进行了一次体格检查，对患有疾病的人员分别协助转业或治疗，使受托儿童的身体健康获得更大保障。去年“六一”儿童节时，组织全市医务工作者普遍检查了各托儿所受托儿童的身体状况。接着，在去年七、八两月，分别对全市各私立托儿所作了一次全面检查，协助其在保育与教育方面加以改进。京市民主妇联并经常组织全市保育工作者集体编写教材供给各托儿所，又经常与政府有关部门共同邀请专家与各公私立托儿所工作人员举行各种业务座谈会，互相交流经验，研究保教问题。
    京市人民政府为了鼓励热心社会福利事业的人士兴办私立托儿所，去年十月曾对十个办得较好的私立托儿所，颁发奖旗或奖金。
    除了鼓励各界人士兴办托儿所外，开办工厂、机关的乳儿室与农村的农忙托儿所是目前广泛开展妇幼福利事业的两项切实可行的办法。去年十月农忙时节，京市人民政府与京市民主妇联，北京师范大学等单位在京郊巴沟、六郎庄、马厂、时家村等四处试办农忙托儿所，深受农民欢迎，不但使农村妇女安心生产，而且对推进农村妇幼卫生工作也起了很大的作用。最近，京市民主妇联又协助北京电信局、北京被服厂和北京人民印刷厂等三部门试办机关与工厂的乳儿室，使参加各种建设事业的母亲们只须花费哺乳婴儿的极少时间，其他保、教事宜完全由保育人员担任，使母亲们能够照常工作。
