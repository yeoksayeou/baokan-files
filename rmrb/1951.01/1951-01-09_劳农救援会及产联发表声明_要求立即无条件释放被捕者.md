　　Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch from Tokyo: On December 6th of last year, the day of the verdict in the Matsukawa Incident, the Japanese Labor-Farmer Relief Association issued a statement saying: The Matsukawa Incident has undergone over ninety public trials. Despite proving that the facts and arguments provided by the prosecutors are nothing more than an "ivory tower" surpassing the Mitaka Incident, it was still given an extremely brutal verdict. This confirms that the judicial power in Japan has lost its independence. This incident, combined with the train derailment and multiple deaths and injuries, is a fabricated suppression of the Japanese Communist Party and worker leaders, a violent act to suppress the counterattack of the National Railway workers and metalworkers against massive layoffs. Recalling the verdict in the Mitaka Incident, fabricated under the same political conspiracy, anyone will clearly see the absurdity of this verdict. This blatantly illustrates that Japan has recently been forced onto the path of colonization, militarization, and war and enslavement.
    On the same day, Yoshida Shigeharu, chairman of the Japan Industrial Unions Federation, the largest progressive trade union in Japan, made a statement saying: "The Matsukawa Incident, following the Shimoyama and Mitaka Incidents, is a conspiracy to suppress the workers' struggle against the massive layoffs in July of the year before last at the 'National Railway'. ...This has become part of the recent frenzied fascist suppression of workers, centered on the red 'purge,' blatantly demonstrating a policy of war and colonization. ...We firmly oppose this atrocity and demand the immediate and unconditional release of all those arrested."

　　劳农救援会及产联发表声明
    要求立即无条件释放被捕者
    【新华社八日讯】东京迟到消息：在松川事件宣判的当天，即去年十二月六日，日本劳农救援会发表声明，内称：松川事件经过九十余次的公审，尽管证明检事提供的事实和论据，不过是超过三鹰事件的“空中楼阁”，但依旧处以极其暴虐的判决。这证实日本的司法权失去了独立性。这一事件是和列车颠覆、多人死伤的事件相结合而捏造的对日共与工人领导者的镇压，是压制国营铁路工人与金属工人为反对大量裁员而进行的反击的暴力行为。回忆一下在同样政治阴谋下捏造的三鹰事件的判决，谁都会清楚这一判决的荒唐。这就露骨地说明了：最近日本已被迫走上殖民地化、军事基地化，走向战争与奴隶化的道路。
    同日，日本最大的进步工会——日本产业别工会联合会主席吉田资治，发表谈话说：“松川事件，是继下山、三鹰事件，镇压为反对前年七月‘国铁’大量裁员而展开的工人斗争的阴谋事件。……这成为最近以红色‘整肃’为中心的、对工人的狂暴的法西斯镇压的一环，露骨地表现了战争与殖民地政策。……我们坚决反对这一暴行，要求即刻无罪释放全体被捕者。”
