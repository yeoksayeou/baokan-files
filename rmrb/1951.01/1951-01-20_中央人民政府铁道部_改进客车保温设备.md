Response to People's Daily Criticism

Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government
    Improving Passenger Car Insulation Equipment

    Comrade Editor:
    The article "Please Taiyuan Railway Bureau Inspect Locomotive Repair Work" by reader Liu Ziyu, published on page two of your newspaper on January 6th, offers valuable suggestions to us. This shows that Comrade Liu is very concerned about the people's railway cause, and we should thank him for that. In addition to a brief explanation of the facts, we will introduce the measures that our ministry has recently taken to address the issue of passenger car insulation:

    I. Facts: On December 24th of last year, the 8th express train departing from Hankou was switched to locomotive No. 1509 of the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, driven by driver Hu Tinglu, between Handan and Shijiazhuang. Because of a problem with the steam valve for heating, it could only supply 3 kilograms of steam to the train. This resulted in excessive cold inside the carriages, causing unnecessary suffering to passengers. This shows that our locomotive departments have not paid enough attention to the heating equipment of locomotives in winter, which deserves deep reflection.

    II. Recent Measures We Have Taken to Improve Passenger Car Insulation: To strengthen winter passenger car insulation equipment, the Director of the Transportation Bureau of this ministry convened a passenger car insulation meeting on the 4th of this month. On the 5th, Deputy Minister Lü convened frontline workers for further discussion on passenger car insulation issues. Based on these two resolutions, Minister Teng made the following important instructions on the issue of passenger car insulation at the Ministry of Railways' national telephone conference on January 8th: 1. Ensure the good quality of locomotives and prohibit the use of defective locomotives to haul passenger trains. 2. Drivers should ensure the supply of adequate heating steam to the carriages at the rear. 3. Train attendants and inspectors should continuously adjust the amount of steam supplied to each carriage to maintain an appropriate temperature. 4. If poor passenger car insulation work is discovered, the responsibility should be investigated and appropriate punishment should be given.

    In addition to instructing each railway administration and relevant departments to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections at any time, the Ministry of Railways also plans to form inspection teams based on different regions to carry out inspections.

                                                Locomotive Bureau, Ministry of Railways

### 中央人民政府铁道部  改进客车保温设备

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　中央人民政府铁道部
    改进客车保温设备           编辑同志：
    一月六日贵报第二版刊载读者刘子玉“请太原局检查机车检修工作”一文，对我们提出了宝贵的意见。这说明了刘同志对人民铁道事业十分关心，是值得我们感谢的。除对事实经过作简单的说明外，并将近来我部对客车保温问题所采取的措施介绍在下面：
    一、事实经过：去年十二月二十四日由汉口出发的第八次快车，在邯郸石家庄间换上太原局石家庄机务段一五○九号机车，由司机胡庭禄驾驶。因暖汽的蒸汽上阀有毛病，仅能向列车送汽三公斤。以致车内太冷，使旅客遭受不应有的痛苦。这说明我们机务部门对冬季机车暖汽装置不够重视，值得深刻检讨。
    二、最近我们对客车保暖的措施：为加强冬季客车保温设备，本月四日曾由本部运输总局局长召开客车保温会议，五日续由吕副部长召集各现场职工，再行研讨有关客车保温问题。根据这两个决议，滕部长在一月八日铁道部全国电话会议上对客车的保温问题，作出如下重要指示：１、保证机车质量良好，禁止不良机车牵引旅客列车。２、司机应保证向后部客车供给适当的暖汽。３、乘务检车员应不断调整各车内的给汽量，保持适当的温度。４、发现客车保温作业不良时应查明责任予以适当的处分。
    以上决议除已饬各管理局及有关部门随时派员深入现场检查外，铁道部并拟根据不同地区，分别组成检查小组，进行检查。
                                                铁道部机务总局
