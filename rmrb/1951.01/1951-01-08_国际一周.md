    Two Kinds of New Year in Two Worlds

    The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union entered 1951 amidst victories and glorious achievements.

    For the socialist country of the Soviet Union, the new year means new victories and getting closer to the goal of communism. In 1950, the Soviet people had already completed the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In the first ten months of last year, the total industrial output had exceeded the 1940 level by 70 percent, and the total grain output reached 7.6 billion poods. Based on these victories, the Soviet people will launch large-scale communist construction in 1951. They will not only build the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations within five years to accelerate electrification, and dig the Turkmen Canal in seven years to transform the desert into fertile fields, but also build the Volga-Don Canal and waterway projects within five years, connecting the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea in the European part of the Soviet Union, making many inland cities into ports of various seas. The great achievements of the Soviet people inspire all progressive mankind to create new pages of history together, making the 20th century a century of peace, victory, and socialist victory.

    The Chinese people celebrated the New Year amidst the great victories of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. In 1950, the Chinese people demonstrated invincible power. The Chinese people not only made great achievements on the economic front, but also organized the Chinese People's Volunteers, who fought side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield, continuously dealing heavy blows to the American invading army. Recently, on New Year's Eve last year, they launched another new large-scale offensive, liberating the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Seoul, in one fell swoop. China has stood up like a giant, respected by the people of the world, and has become one of the major forces determining the development of the world situation. The Chinese people are celebrating the new victories brought by the New Year with jubilation, and are preparing to continue to launch the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect their homes and defend the country with ten times the effort, consolidate national defense, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and consolidate finance and economy.

    All people's democratic countries reviewed their production achievements at the end of the year and planned their work for the new year. The German Democratic Republic's two-year plan was completed in one year and eight months. The government's New Year gift to the people was the abolition of flour and grain rationing, and the implementation of the five-year plan will begin this year. Several major industries in Poland have completed their 1950 plans ahead of schedule. Czechoslovakia's machine output in 1950 exceeded 65 percent of that in 1948. Bulgaria's total industrial output in 1950 exceeded two and a half times that of 1939, and this year's plan stipulates that it will exceed last year's by 23 percent. Romania will begin implementing its first five-year plan and ten-year electrification plan this year. During the New Year, people from all countries are celebrating the increasing strength of their countries and the increasing happiness of their lives.

    However, the situation is different in the capitalist world. Imperialists are welcoming the New Year in a melancholy and gloomy atmosphere, while the vast working people are troubled by the various disasters brought about by the imperialist war policy. Taking the United States as an example, the US ruling clique is trapped in the pain of pessimism, disappointment and mutual blame due to the disastrous defeat in the Korean War. In a statement issued on the eve of last year's New Year's Eve, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said that 1950 was a "dark year" for imperialism, that they were "facing an extremely serious emergency," and that "sacrifices must be made." Dulles, the planner of the American aggressive policy and an imperialist element, asked himself: Has Western (capitalist) civilization become so old that it has to die and give way to a younger, more energetic society arising from the alliance of Marx's communism and Soviet imperialism (should be read as socialism)? After reviewing the four policies of the United States in recent years—supporting reactionaries in Asia and the world, the Marshall Plan and military aid, and using the United Nations as an instrument of aggression—he said: "Serious, perhaps unnecessary, setbacks have occurred." Although the profits of American corporations have greatly increased due to the war of aggression against Korea, the lives of the people have been greatly reduced. The profits of American companies throughout last year exceeded more than twice the highest year during World War II—1944, but the wholesale prices of agricultural products and food have risen by 20 percent since the beginning of last year. The vast American people are groaning under the scourge of increased taxes and the intensified "hurry" system; the number of unemployed is increasing; due to the government's suppression of consumer goods industries and the conversion of some factories to military production, there were an average of 186,000 unemployed people per week in November of last year. On the eve of the New Year, the bourgeois newspapers promised the people the prospect of higher living expenses, a lack of clothing, the disappearance of certain supplies, and a sharp reduction in housing construction in 1951.

    The situation in capitalist countries in Europe is similar to that in the United States.

    The different New Year scenes in the two worlds show a new picture of the rise and fall of the two major camps. The newborn is stronger, and the dying is weaker. At the peak of half a century, life has proved the strength and invincibility of the forces of peace and democracy, and this force that determines the direction of world history will create more brilliant victories in 1951.

    New Great Counter-offensive by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces

    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, which have won great victories, launched a new powerful offensive along the broad front in central Korea on New Year's Eve last year, victoriously advancing rapidly to the southern half of Korea. After quickly defeating the enemy's defense line and causing serious losses to the frightened enemy, the brave warriors of the Chinese and Korean people have successively liberated Kaesong north of Seoul, Munsan, Pocheon, Uijeongbu and other cities, and recovered Seoul on January 4. The capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has now returned to the hands of the Korean people after spending more than three months in the dark night occupied by the US invading army. At present, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are continuing to advance victoriously to the south, towards Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan. The US invading army and the Syngman Rhee bandit army have been defeated and are fleeing south in panic.

    Prior to this, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies began their second major offensive on November 25 last year, and after nearly a month of heroic fighting, they achieved extremely brilliant results. In this campaign, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies completely wiped out all the enemies in the northern half of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, recovered all the territory of the northern half of Korea, and gave the enemy a devastating blow. According to preliminary statistics, more than 34,700 enemy troops were wiped out in the second offensive of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, including more than 11,000 US invading troops wiped out in the east line and 23,700 enemy troops wiped out in the west line, including another 10,500 US invading troops. This campaign forced the US imperialism to admit that it "was the biggest defeat in the history of the US Army."

    The defeat of the enemy and the victory of us in the Korean War has become a foregone conclusion; the failure suffered by the US aggressors is irreversible. Because the US launched the war of aggression against Korea as a desperate gamble, it was unjustifiable politically and very weak militarily. Now it has suffered heavy losses one after another, the combat effectiveness of the troops on the Korean battlefield has been greatly weakened, and the rear is exhausted and cannot be reinforced. Although MacArthur has repeatedly called for help, the US Department of Defense has responded that there are no reinforcements to increase. No matter how the US imperialism plans, what lies before it is: unless the US invading army gets out of Korea, the entire army will be wiped out.

    Great Victory of the People of the World in the United Nations

    The United Nations General Assembly, which opened on September 19 last year, adjourned indefinitely on December 15. The results of this meeting showed that the Soviet Union, China, and the forces of peace and democracy achieved great political and moral victories in the United Nations. However, the US imperialism suffered a shameful political and moral defeat in the United Nations, which it had always manipulated and used to run rampant. At the beginning of this UN meeting, when the US troops invading Korea landed in Incheon and aggressively invaded northern Korea, the US imperialism was in high spirits and vainly attempted to continue to use the UN as a tool to expand the war of aggression, but the result was a complete failure. Even the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang's news agency, the Central News Agency, lamented it.

    Although the US imperialism continued to manipulate the majority at this session of the General Assembly, unreasonably refused to allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations, and kept the United Nations organization in an illegal state without the participation of representatives of a quarter of humanity, the Chinese people's significant right to speak on important issues in the world, especially on Eastern issues, cannot be erased by any force. Just when the US aggressors ignored the serious warnings of the Chinese people, risked expanding their aggression in Korea and suffered head-on blows, Wu Xiuquan, a special representative of our country, was invited to attend the United Nations Security Council and the Political Committee of the General Assembly, participated in the discussion of accusing the US of aggression against China, and made a solemn speech accusing the US of aggressive crimes. For the first time, the just voice of the Chinese people resounded throughout the world through the UN platform, winning the sympathy and resonance of the vast people of the world, giving the US imperialism a heavy blow, and causing panic and confusion within the imperialist bloc. Facts have proved that the People's Republic of China is already a powerful country that plays a pivotal role in the world not only militarily but also politically.

    At the beginning of this General Assembly, the United States, disregarding the warnings of the Chinese people, manipulated the majority to pass the so-called "Eight-Nation Proposal" that facilitated its aggression against the entire territory of Korea. However, after its invading army was defeated miserably, the United States gathered its servant countries to file a slanderous case against the so-called "interference in Korea by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China," which could not be resolved at the General Assembly and had to be shelved. At the same time, the so-called "accusation of the Soviet Union" case filed by the United States at the General Assembly, directing the Kuomintang bandit gang to slander the Soviet Union and the Chinese people, the case of the so-called "Tibetan issue" proposed by El Salvador at the instigation of the United States to interfere with China's liberation of its own territory, and the case of the so-called "Formosa issue" proposed by the United States itself in an attempt to "legalize" its occupation of Taiwan in the United Nations all failed shamefully. The "accusation of the Soviet Union" case completely failed. Even the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and other countries openly expressed their opposition to the US's base practice of insisting on retaining this proposal on the agenda of the General Assembly. The "Tibetan issue" case was not able to be included on the agenda at all. Although the "Formosa issue" case was included on the agenda, it could not be discussed, forcing the United States to withdraw it on its own initiative. Although the United States passed the so-called "United Action for Peace" case at this General Assembly, which attempted to usurp the powers of the Security Council through illegal emergency meetings of the General Assembly to facilitate the United States' aggression at any time in the name of the United Nations, these talismans cannot scare anyone and will not play any real role. Even the US representative to the UN, Lodge, had to admit: If the United States forces the UN to pass a resolution but its servant countries cannot support it in action, as in the Korean War, "then even if the UN passes this resolution by 54 votes to 5 votes, it would not be a victory."

    On the other hand, the Soviet delegation's "Declaration on Preventing the Threat of a New War, Consolidating World Peace and Security" case, the "Accusation of US Aggression against China" case, and the "Accusation of US Violation of Chinese Airspace, Strafing and Bombing Chinese Territory, and Shelling Chinese Ships" case, although rejected or delayed by the majority manipulated by the United States, these just proposals of the Soviet Union have had a huge impact among the peace-loving people of the world. These proposals powerfully exposed the aggressive face of the United States and clearly pointed out the road to peace for the people of the world. Therefore, they received enthusiastic support from the Second World Peace Congress, which represented more than one billion organized people from eighty-one countries; and the refusal of the United States and its followers to accept these just proposals only made them more isolated among the people of the world.

    This UN General Assembly once again proved a truth: What determines the world situation is not a small group of imperialist elements who manipulate the voting machine of the United Nations, but the people of the world who not only have the determination but also have the full power to defend peace.

    The Division of the Imperialist Camp Expands

    The great victory of the world's people's democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, especially the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people on the Korean battlefield, has begun to disintegrate the imperialist camp. This is reflected in the deepening of divisions within the US ruling group, the expansion of contradictions between the US and its servant countries, first of all between the UK and France, and the increase in contradictions between the various servant countries of the US.

    The United States has fallen into extreme chaos. The ruling groups blame each other and attack each other, and the calls for replacing Acheson, Marshall, and MacArthur are getting louder and louder. As a sign of the surface contradiction within the US ruling group, former US President and one of the leaders of the Republican Party, Hoover, delivered a radio speech on December 20 last year. Hoover's speech showed that serious differences had arisen within the US ruling group over the issue of foreign aggression policy due to the disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea. In this speech, Hoover admitted that the US's failure in Korea was irreversible, and recognized that the Soviet Union and the new China were absolutely invincible forces on the Eurasian continent. Therefore, he demanded a change in the plan of aggression, shorten the line of aggression, and advocated that the US should "withdraw" from the Eurasian continent, and take Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines as the western "border" of the US, and the UK as the eastern "border" of the US. Hoover's suggestion of this plan of aggression, which is different from that of the Truman, Dulles, and Marshall groups, represents the views of a very important part of the US ruling group. Seeing that the Truman government's adventurous policy will bring them greater disasters, they are panicked and demand another aggressive policy to replace the current aggressive policy that has proven to be a complete failure. At present, a fierce debate is unfolding within the US ruling group around Hoover's aggressive policy and the US government's current aggressive policy.

    The split between the US and its servant countries is becoming increasingly obvious. The ruling groups of the US servant countries are increasingly complaining and dissatisfied with the US because of their fear of the destruction that the US's adventurous policies will bring them. According to the former Far East Director of the British Foreign Office, Butler, on December 22 last year: "The undercurrents of dissatisfaction with American policies in Britain and on the European continent are continuing to increase." British Labor Party members cursed MacArthur as "a bull in a china shop." The French bourgeoisie is full of fear of American policies, and some of them criticize "America's lack of experience, impetuosity, mistakes, and errors." The US is also trying its best to attack its servant countries for not listening to the US. The US Information Service's comprehensive review of US newspapers and magazines for the week of December 17 last year criticized "the frightful attitude of America's European allies and their cowardice and procrastination." The US and its servant countries, especially between the UK and France, are increasingly mistrustful of each other. The US government complains that the European countries participating in the Atlantic Treaty lack the military strength to be a strong assistant in promoting wars of aggression. Some British bourgeoisie feel that military expenditures are expanding day by day, and the British economy may go bankrupt due to preparations for war, but they still cannot keep up with the demands of the US. They are unwilling to truly hand over the British army to Eisenhower. Diplomats in Paris believe that the US is organizing an American-British-West German group behind the scenes and is preparing to abandon France. A so-called "neutralist movement" is growing among a part of the French bourgeoisie. Recently, a saying is popular in the US and Western Europe: Once the international situation becomes tense, the US and Western Europe may abandon each other. Although this has not yet become a reality, its development is quite noteworthy. The US government has repeatedly announced its steps to step up war preparations in a panic, attempting to stabilize the panic within the imperialist camp with this. This is why Truman announced that the US had entered a "national emergency," and the US coerced the North Atlantic aggressive group to meet in Brussels to establish a unified North Atlantic aggressive army with the participation of West German mercenaries, and appointed US General Eisenhower as its supreme commander. But all of these have not given any encouragement to the imperialist camp. Since announcing that the US has entered a "state of emergency" has proven that it cannot scare China, Korea, and the people of the world, the result can only cause greater panic and suspicion within the imperialist camp. And the so-called North Atlantic unified army is still only an "army on paper." Even the United Press International had to sadly admit that its future is "rather bleak" if Eisenhower wants to organize it successfully.

    The mutual attacks, suspicions, and complaints between the US and its servant countries and within the US ruling group show that the imperialist group is in a state of chaos, and the US imperialism is facing the danger of being abandoned by everyone. This proves how profound and huge the victory of the world's people headed by the Soviet Union, especially the victory of the Chinese and Korean people, is, and how fragile the imperialist camp itself is.

　　国际一周
    两个世界的两种新年
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，在胜利与光辉的成就中进入一九五一年。
    对于社会主义国家苏联，新的一年就是新的胜利，就是更加接近了共产主义的目标。一九五○年，苏联人民已提前完成了战后五年计划，在去年头十个月中，工业总产量已超过一九四○年水平的百分之七十，谷物总产量达到七十六亿普特。在这些胜利的基础上，苏联人民将在一九五一年展开巨大规模的共产主义建设。他们不但要在五年之内建设起古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站以加速电气化，在七年内开凿土库曼大运河以改造沙漠为肥田，并且要在五年内修建伏尔加——顿河运河与水道工程，把苏联欧洲部分的白海、波罗的海、亚速海、里海和黑海联结起来，使许多内陆城市变为各海洋的港口。苏联人民的伟大业迹鼓舞着全体进步人类共同来创造历史的新页，使二十世纪成为和平胜利、社会主义胜利的世纪。
    中国人民在抗美援朝的伟大胜利声中庆祝了新年。一九五○年，中国人民显示了无敌的力量。中国人民不仅在经济战线上取得了伟大的成就，而且组织了中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜战场上与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，连续予美国侵略军队以沉重的打击。最近又于去年除夕发动又一次新的大攻势，一举解放朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首都汉城。中国已经像巨人一样地站了起来，受到全世界人民的尊敬，成为决定世界形势发展的重大力量之一。中国人民万众欢腾地迎接新年带来的新胜利，并且准备以十倍的努力继续展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动，巩固国防，巩固人民民主专政，巩固财政经济。
    各个人民民主国家都在岁末检阅了生产成就，并且计划了新的一年内的工作。德意志民主共和国的两年计划早已在一年零八个月内完成，政府送给人民的新年礼物是取消面粉和谷物配给制，并且今年开始执行五年计划。波兰若干主要工业已提前完成一九五○年的计划。捷克斯洛伐克一九五○年的机器产量超过一九四八年百分之六十五。保加利亚一九五○年的工业总产量超过一九三九年的两倍半，今年的计划规定要再超过去年百分之二十三。罗马尼亚从今年开始执行第一个五年计划和十年电气化计划。新年时候，各国人民都在欢庆他们国家的日益强大和他们的生活的日益幸福。
    但是在资本主义世界里，情况却是另外一个样子。帝国主义者是在忧郁、阴暗的气氛中迎接新年，而广大劳动人民则为帝国主义的战争政策所带来的各种灾难所困迫。即以美国来说，在美国统治集团内部，因朝鲜战争的惨败而陷于悲观失望和互相埋怨的苦恼中。美国务卿艾奇逊在去年除夕前夕所发表的声明中说，一九五○年对于帝国主义是“黑暗的一年”，它们“面临的紧急局势是极其严重的”，“须要牺牲”。美侵略政策的策划者帝国主义分子杜勒斯向自己发问道：西方（资本主义）文明是不是已经变得这样老朽，以致不得不死去，而让位于从马克思的共产主义和苏联的帝国主义（应读作社会主义）的联盟所产生出来的更年青的、精力充沛的社会。他检讨了美国在近年的扶植亚洲和世界各国反动派，马歇尔计划和军事援助以及利用联合国作为侵略工具等四项政策后说：“已经发生了严重的也许是不必要的挫折。”虽然美国大公司的利润因侵朝战争而大大地增加了，但人民的生活却大大地降低了。去年全年美国公司的利润超过了第二次世界大战中的最高年份——一九四四年的二倍以上，但农产品和粮食的批发价格自去年年初以来却上涨了百分之二十。广大美国人民在税收增加、“赶快”制度加紧的厄运里呻吟；失业人数在增加着；由于政府抑制消费品工业以及某些工厂改装作军事生产，去年十一月份平均每星期要有十八万六千失业者。在新年前夕，资产阶级报纸约许给人民的一九五一年的景象，是更高的生活费、缺乏衣着、某些用品绝迹和住宅建筑剧减。
    在欧洲的资本主义国家内，情况也与美国类似。
    两个世界的不同的年景，显示了两大阵营力量消长的新的景象，新生的更加茁壮了，垂死的更加衰弱了。在半世纪的顶点，生活已证实了和平民主力量的强大无敌，而这一决定世界历史方向的力量，将在一九五一年创造出更加辉煌灿烂的胜利。
    中朝人民部队新的大反攻
    已经获得伟大胜利的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军，于去年除夕沿朝鲜中部的广阔前线又发动了新的强大攻势，汹涌地向朝鲜南半部胜利疾进。中朝人民的勇士们在迅速击溃敌人防线，并使惊魂未定的敌人又遭受严重损失后，已先后解放了汉城以北的开城，汶山、抱川、议政府等城，并于一月四日光复了汉城。这个朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的首都，在度过为美国侵略军所占领的三个多月的黑夜后，现在又重新回到朝鲜人民的手中了。目前，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军正在继续向南胜利前进，向大田、大邱、釜山胜利前进。美国侵略军与李承晚匪军则已溃不成军，正在向南狼狈溃逃。
    在这以前，中朝人民军队于去年十一月二十五日开始的第二次大攻势，在经过近一个月的英勇作战后，取得了极其辉煌的战果。在这次战役中，中朝人民军队完全肃清了朝鲜人民共和国北半部的所有敌人，光复了朝鲜北半部的全部领土，并给了敌人以歼灭性的打击。据初步统计，在中朝人民军队第二次攻势中，被消灭的敌军共达三万四千七百余人，其中东线被消灭的美国侵略军有一万一千余人，西线被消灭的敌军有二万三千七百人，内有美国侵略军一万另五百人。这次战役，使美帝国主义也不得不自认“是美国陆军史上最大的失败”。
    朝鲜战争的敌败我胜已成定局；美国侵略者所遭受的失败，已经无可挽回。因为美国所发动的侵略朝鲜战争是种孤注一掷的冒险，它政治上既然师出无名，军事上也十分虚弱。现在接二连三地受到重大损失，在朝鲜战场的部队战斗力已大大减弱，而后方又后备枯竭，无法增援。麦克阿瑟虽一再呼号求救，但美国防部答以无援可增。不管美帝国主义如何打算，摆在它面前的是：除非美国侵略军滚出朝鲜，否则就要全军覆没。
    世界人民在联合国内的伟大胜利
    去年九月十九日开幕的联合国大会，已于十二月十五日宣告无定期休会了。这次会议的结果表明：苏联、中国与和平民主力量在联合国内取得了伟大的政治上、道义上的胜利。而美国帝国主义却在一向为它所操纵把持而借以横行霸道的联合国内，遭到了政治上、道义上的可耻失败。在这次联合国开会之初，当侵朝美军登陆仁川，气势汹汹地向朝鲜北部窜犯时，美帝国主义气焰万丈，妄想继续利用联合国作为扩大侵略战争的工具，但结果竟一败涂地。这连国民党残余匪帮的通讯社中央社亦为之悲叹。
    尽管美帝国主义继续在本届大会上操纵多数，无理拒绝接纳中华人民共和国的代表参加联合国，而使联合国组织继续处于没有全人类四分之一的人民的代表参加的非法状态中，但是中国人民在全世界重要问题上，特别是在东方问题上的重大发言权，决不是任何力量所能抹煞的。就在美国侵略者不顾中国人民的严重警告、冒险扩大其在朝鲜的侵略而碰得头破血流的时候，我国特派代表伍修权应邀出席了联合国安全理事会与大会政治委员会，参加了控诉美国侵略中国的讨论，作了控诉美国侵略罪行的庄严发言。中国人民的正义呼声第一次通过联合国讲台而响彻全世界，博得了全世界广大人民的同情与共鸣，给了美帝国主义以沉重的打击，引起了帝国主义集团内部的惊慌和混乱。事实证明中华人民共和国已经不但在军事上，而且在政治上都是在全世界举足轻重的强国。
    在这次大会开始时，美国曾不顾中国人民的警告，而穷凶极恶地操纵多数通过了便利其侵略朝鲜全境的所谓“八国提案”。但是在其侵朝军队惨遭败北以后，美国纠集其仆从国家提出的所谓“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”的诽谤案，竟无法在大会上得出结果，而不得不被搁置。同时，美国在大会上指挥国民党匪帮提出的污蔑苏联与中国人民的所谓“控苏案”，美国嗾使萨尔瓦多提出干涉中国解放自己领土的所谓“西藏问题”案，美国亲自提出企图使其侵占台湾的行为在联合国获得“合法化”的所谓“福摩萨问题”案等，都可耻地破产了。“控苏案”完全失败了，连英国、澳大利亚、加拿大等国，都公开表示反对美国还强把这个提案保留在大会议程上的卑劣做法。“西藏问题”案根本没有能列入议程。而“福摩萨问题”案虽然列入议程，却无法讨论，而迫使美国不得不自行提出予以搁置。虽然美国在这次大会上通过了企图以非法的大会紧急会议篡窃安理会职权来便利美国随时假借联合国名义进行侵略的所谓“保障和平的联合行动案”，但是，这些护符并不能吓倒任何人，也就起不了什么真正作用。连美国出席联大代表洛奇也不得不供认：假如美国迫使联合国通过决议而其仆从国家不能在行动上予以支持，如像在朝鲜战争中那样的话，“那末，纵令联合国以五十四票对五票通过这个决议案，也不见得就是胜利”。
    另一方面，苏联代表团所提出的“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”案，“控诉美国侵略中国”案，与“控诉美国侵犯中国领空扫射与轰炸中国领土及炮轰中国船只”案，虽然为美国操纵的多数所否决，或予以延搁，但是苏联的这些正义提案已在全世界爱好和平的人民中间发生了巨大的影响。这些提案有力地揭露了美国的侵略面目，明确地为全世界人民指出了和平的道路，因而受到了代表八十一个国家十亿以上有组织人民的第二届保卫世界和平大会的热烈支持；而美国及其追随者的拒绝这些正义提案，只是使它们自己在全世界人民中更加孤立。
    这次联合国大会再次证明了一个真理：决定世界局势的，决不是操纵联合国的表决机器的一小撮帝国主义分子，而是全世界的不仅有决心、而且已有充分力量保卫和平的人民。
    帝国主义阵营的分裂扩大
    以苏联为首的世界人民民主力量的伟大胜利，特别是中朝人民在朝鲜战场上的伟大胜利，使帝国主义阵营内部开始分崩离析。这表现在美国统治集团内部分歧的加深，美国与它的仆从国家首先是与英法之间矛盾的扩大，以及美国各仆从国家之间矛盾的增加。
    美国已陷于极度混乱中。统治集团内部彼此互相埋怨，互相攻击，要求撤换艾奇逊、马歇尔、麦克阿瑟的叫喊愈来愈高。作为美国统治集团内部矛盾表面化的标志的，是美国前总统、共和党首脑之一胡佛在去年十二月二十日发表的广播演说。胡佛这一演说表明：美国统治集团内部已因侵朝战争的惨败而发生了对外侵略政策问题上的严重分歧。胡佛在这篇演说中承认美国在朝鲜的失败已经无法挽回，认定苏联和新中国在欧亚大陆上是绝对不可战胜的力量，因此他要求改变侵略计划，缩短侵略战线，主张美国应该“退出”欧亚大陆，而以日本、台湾、菲律宾为美国的西方“边界”，以英国为美国的东方“边界”。胡佛提出的这一与杜鲁门、杜勒斯、马歇尔集团不同的侵略计划的建议，代表了美国统治集团中很重要的一部分意见，他们眼看到杜鲁门政府的这种冒险政策，将给他们带来更大的灾难，因此惊惶失措地要求以另一个侵略政策，来代替已经证明完全破产了的现行侵略政策。目前，美国统治集团内部正环绕着胡佛的侵略政策和美国政府的现行侵略政策，展开着激烈的争论。
    美国与它的仆从国家之间的分裂日益明显。美国仆从国家的统治集团由于对美国冒险政策将给它们带来的毁灭的恐惧，对美国的抱怨和不满的情绪，正一天比一天增加。据英国外交部前远东司司长白特勒去年十二月二十二日透露：“现在英国与在欧洲大陆上反对美国政策的不满的暗流，正在继续增加”。英国的工党议员咒骂麦克阿瑟是“闯进了瓷器店里的牛”。法国资产阶级内部则充满着对美国政策的恐惧，其中一部分人批评“美国的缺少经验、浮躁、过失和错误”。而美国也极力攻击它的仆从国家不听从美国的吩咐。美国新闻处去年十二月十七日综合的美国报章杂志一周评论，叱责“美国的欧洲盟国的骇怕态度以及懦怯与拖沓”。美国和它的仆从国，首先是与英法之间，已愈来愈互不信任。美国政府埋怨参加大西洋公约的欧洲各国缺乏军事实力，不足以成为推行侵略战争的有力助手。英国一部分资产阶级感到军费日益扩充，英国经济可能因准备战争而破产，但仍跟不上美国的要求。它们不愿将英国军队真正交给艾森豪威尔指挥。巴黎外交界人士认为美国正在背后组织美英西德集团，而准备抛弄法国。在一部分法国资产阶级中正滋长着一种所谓“中立主义的运动”。近来美国与西欧流行一种说法：即一旦国际局势紧张，美国与西欧可能相互背弃。这在目前虽还未成为事实，但其发展颇堪注意。美国政府一再手忙脚乱地宣布其加紧备战的步骤，企图以此稳定帝国主义阵营内部的慌乱。这就是杜鲁门宣布美国进入“全国紧急状态”，美国胁迫北大西洋侵略集团在布鲁塞尔开会，建立有西德雇佣军参加的北大西洋统一侵略军，并任命以美国将领艾森豪威尔为其最高司令。但是所有这些都并不能予帝国主义阵营以任何鼓舞。宣布美国进入“紧急状态”既然已证明不能吓倒中国、朝鲜与全世界人民，其结果就只能在帝国主义阵营内部引起更大的惊恐与疑惧。而所谓北大西洋统一军队目前还只是“纸上的军队”，艾森豪威尔要把它组织成功，就连合众社也不得不悲哀地承认：其前途“颇为渺茫”。
    美国与其仆从国家间以及美国统治集团内部间的相互攻讦、疑惧、抱怨，表现了帝国主义集团正处在一片混乱中，而美帝国主义正面临众叛亲离的危险。这证明以苏联为首的世界人民的胜利，特别是中朝人民的胜利有多么深邃的巨大影响，而帝国主义阵营本身又是多么脆弱。
