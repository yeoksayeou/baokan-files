　　I Improved the "Universal Lathe"
    Anhui North Tianjia'an Jiulonggang Railway Factory Wu Beihai oral account, Shen Xianju recording
    This lathe is basically good. Its name is "Universal Lathe," but if you install the turning tool, it's as good as a dead object unless you use manpower to crank the handle. When I was turning large gears, it was very laborious to crank, working for a while and then resting, only able to do half a day's work in a day. Therefore, I wanted to改造（transform）it. I kept thinking about it, unable to sleep for several nights in a row. I couldn't eat well either, and whenever I had time, I would open the machine and study it, doing this for about a month. Once, I took a strip of iron plate and two discarded small gears to experiment with, but others gave me a setback, and I didn't want to study it anymore. Master craftsman Chai Shusheng saw this situation and advised me: "Don't listen to their nonsense, keep going, we can study together if there are any problems." After he said that, my enthusiasm returned, and Master Chai constantly gave me technical guidance. After a period of exploration and experimentation, I managed to make the feed move up and down automatically, but it was not fully transformed yet. Later, I went to work on another lathe.
    Comrade Guan Min returned from studying at the Puzhen Communist Youth League School, and he saw the device on this lathe and thought it was very good. He inquired about the matter, and the trade union wrote a commendation poster and posted it where I worked, so that I could see it whenever I looked up. I was happy when I saw it, and the feeling in my heart was hard to describe. Later, with the encouragement of the trade union and the help of my comrades, I finally transformed it completely successfully. Now it turns regularly, not suddenly tight or slow. It not only improves work efficiency but also improves quality. I also gave it a name: "Automatic Lifting and Lowering Feed Machine."

### 我改进了“万能镟床”

　　我改进了“万能镟床”
    皖北田家庵九龙岗铁路工厂吴北海口述  沈先举记录
    这部床子基本上是好的。它的名子叫“万能镟床”，可是你把镟刀装上去，若不用人力去摇手把，它就等于一个死家伙。我在镟大牙齿轮的时候，摇着很吃力，干一会歇一会，一天只能干半天的活。因此我就想把它改造一下。我不停地思谋着，一连几夜睡不着觉。饭也吃不好，一有空，我就开开机器研究，这样有一个月的光景。有一次，我拿一根铁板条和两个废的小牙轮做试验，别人给我钉子碰，我很泄气，不愿再研究了。柴树声老师傅看到这情形，就劝我：“你别听他那一套，继续干吧，有什么问题咱们可以共同研究。”经他这么一说，我的热劲又来了，柴师傅不断在技术上指点我。经过一个时期摸索试验，弄得走刀可以自动上下了，可是还没有全部改造好，以后我就到另一部床子上作活去了。
    关敏同志由浦镇团校学习回来，他看见这部床子上的装置、认为很好，他问清了这件事，工会就写了一张表扬榜贴在我工作的地方，使我一抬头就能看见，我一看见就高兴，心里那股味儿真说不上来。后来在工会的鼓励和同志们的帮助下，终于把它全部改造成功了。现在转起来有了规矩，不忽紧忽慢了，不但提高工作效率，而且又能提高质量。我也就给它取了个名字叫“自动升降走刀机”。
