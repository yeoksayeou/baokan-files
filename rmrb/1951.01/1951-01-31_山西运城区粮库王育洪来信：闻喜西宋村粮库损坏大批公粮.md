Letter from Wang Yuhong of Yuncheng Grain Depot, Shanxi:
Damage to Large Quantities of Public Grain in Xisong Village Grain Depot, Wenxi

To the Editor:

　　The Xisong Village Grain Depot in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, stores 200,000 jin of wheat. When I inspected the depot on January 17th, I discovered that over 150,000 jin of the 200,000 jin of wheat were heating up (30,000 jin of which had reached temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius). The rest was also hardened, and exhibited signs of sprouting, growing white mold, forming clumps, and turning green due to mildew. Rat holes and rat droppings were everywhere, especially rat footprints all over the warehouse. However, the depot's report to the county sub-depot on January 15th stated that: the granary had been thoroughly inspected and there was no loss of public grain whatsoever. This is a completely deceptive act towards higher authorities.

　　According to reports, most of the depot doors in the county were not locked, only tied with hemp rope and sealed with paper strips. The county sub-depot has five large wooden seals, but they were not stamped on the stored grain in each depot. When I went to inspect the Shangqiu Village depot on the 17th, I found that the seals on two depot doors had been torn off, and the hemp ropes were not in their original state. The amount of public grain stolen is unclear (this issue is currently under investigation). The higher authorities have repeatedly instructed that the equipment used by the grain depots must not be lent out, but the county sub-depot lent out 500 hemp sacks on December 19th of last year without prior consultation and without reporting to higher authorities afterward.

　　The occurrence of these situations is mainly due to the ideological paralysis and weak political responsibility of the grain storage cadres. They are neither familiar with the business of storing grain, nor are they willing to humbly learn, resulting in superficial inspections, lip service, and false reports to higher authorities. I hope that the relevant authorities will give these derelict cadres certain punishments and education, and order them to conduct profound self-criticisms.

　　In order to do a good job in the storage of public grain, I believe that prevention should be the primary focus, with treatment as secondary. Under the current circumstances, each depot should immediately improve ventilation equipment this winter to reduce grain temperature and moisture content. In addition, the responsibilities of all levels of storage personnel should be clearly defined to establish dedicated positions. In order to prevent sabotage by special agents, mobilizing the surrounding masses to consciously and voluntarily protect the grain is also a very important task.

### 山西运城区粮库王育洪来信：闻喜西宋村粮库损坏大批公粮

　　山西运城区粮库王育洪来信：
　  闻喜西宋村粮库损坏大批公粮编辑同志：
    山西闻喜县西宋村粮库存有小麦二十万斤。一月十七日我到该库检查时，发现该库存麦二十万斤中有十五万斤以上发热（其中三万斤温度已达四十度以上），其他亦呈硬性，并有生芽、出白毛、结成圪塔，发绿等霉烂现象。鼠洞鼠屎，特别是鼠足印满仓都是。但该库一月十五日向县分库的报告说是：库房已普遍进行了检查，公粮没有任何损失。这完全是欺骗上级的行为。
    按该县大部库门都未加锁，只用麻绳绑着，上加封条；县分库刻有大木印五个，但各库存粮并未加盖。十七日前往上邱村库检查时，发现有两个库门封条被扯掉了，麻绳也不是原样，究竟被盗公粮多少？自己也闹不清（此问题正在追查中）。粮库所使用的器材，上级再三指示不得外借，而该县分库于去年十二月十九日却借出麻袋五○○条，事前没有请示，事后又未向上级报告。
    这些情况的发生，主要是粮食保管干部的思想麻痹，政治责任心不强，对保管粮食的业务既不熟悉，而又不肯虚心学习，致检查时形成走马观花，阳奉阴违，向上级机关作假报告。我希望有关机关应予这些失职干部以一定的处分和教育，并令其进行深刻的检讨。
    为了作好公粮的保管工作，我认为应该是以防为主，以治为副。在目前情况下，在今冬各库即应立即作好通风设备，以降低粮温和减少水份。另外，各级保管人员应分工明确，以确定专职。为防止特务的破坏，发动周围群众自觉自愿地进行护粮也是十分重要的工作。
