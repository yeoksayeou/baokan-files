　　Train Propaganda (Propaganda Work Experience)
            (I) Datong's "Train Propaganda"
    The "Train Propaganda" in the Datong area of the Tianjin Railway Bureau began in June of this year. Workers and staff from the Transportation Section and police officers from the Public Security Section participated in this propaganda work. In the past six months, they have conducted propaganda to more than 460,000 passengers.
    Before the outbreak of the Korean War, the content of Datong's train propaganda focused on "Passenger Instructions," which contained basic railway knowledge. Later, it mainly focused on current affairs and policies. In June, July, and August, the focus was mainly on opposing American aggression, the peace signature campaign, and the victory news of the Korean People's Army. On memorial days such as "July 1st," "July 7th," "August 1st," and National Day, the propaganda focused on these festivals. When the Central People's Government announced important policies (such as the Marriage Law and the Land Reform Law), the propaganda focused on these policies. Various major tasks carried out by the local government, such as the autumn grain collection, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, banning the Yiguandao sect, and opposing rumors, were also part of the train propaganda content. In recent times, the main content of train propaganda has been current affairs issues such as resisting America and aiding Korea and the fact that atomic bombs are not scary.
    Train propaganda must adopt popular forms that passengers like to see and hear. At the beginning, Datong's train propaganda only used speeches and newspaper readings, which passengers did not like to listen to. Later, it adapted to the passengers' requirements and gradually created various forms, such as storytelling-style explanations, clapper talk, Xihe Dagu drum ballad, Taiping lyrics, Henan Zhui Zi ballad, rhythmic storytelling, picture explanations, storytelling, and current affairs briefings. They used a question-and-answer method with "rhythmic storytelling" to explain common sense about taking the train to passengers (mainly farmers); they used illustrations to promote "Passenger Instructions," drawing various accidents such as falling off the train, fires, and lost children that have occurred over the years due to passengers' inattention as cartoons and posted them in the carriages for passengers to see; they used the form of clapper talk to promote resisting America and aiding Korea, the fact that atomic bombs are not scary, and common sense about children's hygiene to passengers; they used forms such as Dagu drum ballad, Taiping lyrics, Xihe Dagu drum ballad, and Henan Zhui Zi ballad, which are popular among the people in the Jingsui East Section area, to conduct propaganda on peace signatures, resisting America and aiding Korea, and Sino-Soviet friendship.
    These propaganda efforts have achieved great results. For example, as a result of promoting peace signatures, more than 15,000 passengers signed on the train in July and August; when promoting the new marriage policy, because it vividly exposed the oppression of women in the old society, some women were moved to tears; when promoting the banning of the Yiguandao sect, they used storytelling to give examples of how someone in a certain place was superstitious about the sect, how they were deceived, and how they ended up bankrupt and used by special agents; when promoting opposition to rumors, they exposed the essence of various rumors along the Jingsui Railway, all of which had a certain impact on passengers.
    The experience gained from Datong's train propaganda is: 1. Pay attention to the seriousness of propaganda work. The content of propaganda must have a reliable basis. Except for materials already published in newspapers, other materials must be reviewed. Providing propaganda workers with materials in a timely manner is one of the most important keys to doing a good job in propaganda work. 2. Propaganda should be popularized, and feedback from the masses should be listened to in a timely manner to make improvements. 3. Prevent the phenomenon of only paying attention to propaganda and neglecting the regular work on the train, which may lead to accidents. 4. Strengthen learning. You cannot be a good propagandist without learning.
            (II) "Train Propaganda" by Northern Jiaotong University and Railway College
    In the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda campaign, students from various departments of Beijing Railway College and Northern Jiaotong University, with the strong assistance of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, started "train propaganda" on the Beijing-Tianjin, Beijing-Baotou, Beijing-Shenyang, and Beijing-Shanghai lines on November 19th. A total of ten trips were made, and the passengers warmly welcomed the propagandists. The students tried their best to use popular forms such as clapper talk, comic dialogues, shadow plays, cartoon explanations, Henan Zhui Zi ballad, and "Little Shepherd Boy" song, as well as popular lectures, to conduct propaganda. When the singing started, passengers who knew how to sing sang along. When passengers raised questions and asked for explanations, the propagandists explained very patiently, explaining again if once was not enough.
    In this propaganda campaign, it was found that train propaganda has its unique features: (1) The audience is relatively fixed, easy to keep quiet, and concentrates on listening, which is conducive to propaganda. (2) Individual conversations can be conducted, which makes it easy to collect opinions and improve work. (3) Some forms of propaganda, such as dance, drama, and living newspaper, cannot be used on the train, while forms such as shadow plays, lectures, clapper talk, Henan Zhui Zi ballad, and country tunes are suitable for train propaganda. (4) The effect of train propaganda is quite significant because passengers are going to all parts of the country, and its scope of influence is even wider. As one passenger said, "Conducting propaganda on the train is equivalent to conducting propaganda to the whole country."

　　列车宣传（宣传工作经验）
            （一）大同的“列车宣传”
    天津铁路局大同地区的“列车宣传”，是今年六月开始的。参加这一宣传工作的是车务段的工人和职员，以及公安段的公安员。半年来，他们向四十六万多的旅客进行了宣传。
    大同列车宣传的内容，在朝鲜战争爆发前，是以关于铁路基本知识的“旅客须知”为中心，以后即以时事政策为主。六、七、八月份主要是以反对美国侵略、和平签名运动及朝鲜人民军的胜利消息为中心。在“七一”“七七”“八一”及国庆等纪念日，又以有关这些节日的宣传为重点。当中央人民政府有重要政策公布时（如婚姻法、土地改革法等），即以关于这些政策的宣传为重点。当地政府进行的各项主要工作，如秋征、镇压反革命、取缔一贯道、反对谣言等，也是列车宣传内容的一部分。最近一个时期，列车宣传内容，主要是抗美援朝和原子弹不可怕等时事问题。
    列车宣传须采用旅客喜见乐闻的通俗形式。大同列车宣传开始只用讲话和读报的方式来进行，旅客多不爱听。后来才适应旅客的要求，逐渐创造了各种各样的形式，例如说评书式的讲解、快板、西河大鼓、太平歌词、河南坠子、数来宝、图画讲解、讲故事、时事简报等。他们曾用“数来宝”的一问一答的方法，向旅客（主要是农民）解释了坐火车的常识；用图解方法宣传了“旅客须知”，把历年来因旅客不注意而发生的坠车、火灾、掉小孩种种事故画成漫画，贴在车厢里让旅客看；用说快板的形式，把抗美援朝、原子弹不可怕、小孩卫生常识等宣传给旅客听；用京绥东段地区老百姓喜欢听的大鼓、太平歌词、西河大鼓、河南坠子等形式，进行了和平签名、抗美援朝及中苏友好等方面的宣传。
    这些宣传都曾收到很大效果，例如，由于宣传和平签名的结果，七八月份曾有一万五千多旅客在列车上签名；在宣传新婚姻政策时，因为生动地揭发了旧社会对妇女的压迫，有些妇女曾感动得流下泪来；在宣传取缔一贯道时，用说故事的方式，举出某地某人迷信道门，如何受骗，最后落得倾家荡产，被特务利用等等，在宣传反对谣言时，针对京绥路沿线的各种谣言，从本质上予以揭发，都对旅客发生了一定影响。
    大同列车宣传所获得的经验是：一、注意宣传工作的严肃性，宣传内容一定要有确实根据，除报纸已经公布的材料外，其他材料均须经过审查。及时供给宣传员以材料，是使宣传工作做好的重要关键之一。二、宣传要通俗化，及时听取群众反映，以便改进。三、应防止只顾宣传不顾车上经常工作，因而发生事故的现象。四、加强学习，不学习就不能当好宣传员。
            （二）北方交大及铁道学院的“列车宣传”
    北京铁道学院和北方交通大学各系级学生在抗美援朝的宣传中，在天津铁路局北京分局的大力协助下，于十一月十九日曾在京津、京包、京沈、京沪等线开始了“列车宣传”。前后共出动十次，旅客们对宣传员极表欢迎。同学们尽量利用快板、相声、拉洋片、漫画解释、河南坠子、小放牛等大众化的形式与通俗的讲演形式来进行宣传。当歌声起来时，会唱的旅客也跟着一块儿唱起来。当旅客们提出问题要求解释时，宣传员都非常耐心地解释，一遍不够，再解释一遍。
    在这次宣传中，发现列车宣传有其独特的地方：（一）听众是较固定的，易保持安静，听时专心，利于宣传。（二）可以进行个别谈话，易于收集意见，改进工作。（三）有些宣传形式如舞蹈、话剧、活报剧等在车上不能利用，而拉洋片、讲演、快板、河南坠子及乡间小调等形式则适于作列车宣传。（四）列车宣传效果相当大，因为旅客是到全国四面八方去的，它的影响范围也就更加广泛。正如一位旅客所说：“在列车上进行宣传，就等于向全国作宣传。”
