    China Grain Company, Northern Jiangsu Branch
    Adjusts Grain to Shorten Transportation Lines
    Last winter, the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the China Grain Company transported a large amount of grain from the Northeast to meet the needs of the people in Northern Jiangsu. At the same time, the Northern Jiangsu Grain Bureau had to collect a large amount of grain from within Northern Jiangsu and transport it north to supply the Huai River project. In light of the above, the Northern Jiangsu Grain Bureau and the Grain Company, in order to shorten transportation mileage, save manpower, and reduce national expenditure, jointly discussed and decided through the Northern Jiangsu Finance Committee to exchange grain. This shortened the southbound railway mileage by 2.4 million ton-kilometers, saving freight and possible grain loss worth 459.6 million yuan. It also saved 880,050 ton-kilometers of inland water transport in Northern Jiangsu, saving freight and possible grain loss totaling 600.3 million yuan; loading and unloading costs along the way were saved by 150 million yuan. The same amount of grain transported northward saved 919.125 million yuan in freight and possible grain loss. Due to the shortening and reduction of transportation mileage, at least 100 escort personnel were spared. Since one trip took more than 20 days, 2,000 workdays and travel expenses along the way were saved. According to the above statistics, a total of 2,151.95 million yuan was saved. Based on the then rice price of 1,075 yuan per jin in Northern Jiangsu, this is equivalent to more than 2 million jin of rice. This also alleviated the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity in Northern Jiangsu at that time.
    This is a model example of exchanging materials based on circumstances to save national financial expenditure. Similar transportation situations may exist throughout the country, and I hope to draw the attention and research of finance committees in various regions.

    中国粮食公司苏北分公司
    调剂粮食缩短运输线
    中国粮食公司苏北分公司，去年冬季，自东北调运大量粮食，供苏北民需。而同时间内，苏北粮食局，又须从苏北境内，集运大批粮食，北上供应导淮之用。根据上述情况，苏北粮食局与粮食公司，为了缩短运输里程，节省人力，减少国家的支出起见，共同商讨并经苏北财委会决定，互换粮食。这样便缩短了南运铁路里程计二百四十万吨公里，节省运费及可能蚀耗粮食共计值四亿五千九百六十万元，又省去水运苏北内地里程计八十八万五十吨公里，计运费及可能蚀耗粮共计六亿零三百余万元；沿途上卸下运计省各项费用一亿五千万元。北运的同量粮食共节省运费及可能蚀耗粮计九亿一千九百十二万五千元。由于运输里程的缩短和减省，而免用押运人员至少在一百名以上。运输一趟必须二十多天，可节省二千个工作日及沿途旅费的支出。按以上各项统计，共节省支出计二十一亿五千一百九十五万元。以当时苏北米价一千○七十五元一斤计算，可值大米二百多万斤。因此也减轻了苏北当时运输力不敷的困难。
    这是一件根据情况互换物资以节省国家财政支出的模范事例。像类似的这样调运情况，全国都可能存在，我希望能引起各地财委的注意和研究。
