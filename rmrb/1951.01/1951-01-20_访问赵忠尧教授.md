　　Visiting Professor Zhao Zhongyao
    Bai Sheng
    Professor Zhao Zhongyao, a famous atomic physicist who studied in the United States and is deeply cared for by the Chinese people, arrived in Beijing on January 17. During his return to the country, he suffered various persecutions and was unreasonably detained and imprisoned by the American imperialists in Japan for forty-seven days.

    Professor Zhao Zhongyao, who is already forty-eight years old, is brimming with youthful enthusiasm and high spirits. He spoke with warmth and indignation about his unreasonable persecution by the American imperialists. He had been preparing to return to China since March of last year, and it took a full five months of obstruction before he obtained a transit permit from the Hong Kong government, which obeyed the will of the American imperialists. He boarded a ship from Los Angeles, USA, last August, and it took a total of nine months before he returned to his motherland at the end of last November. During this period, he was subjected to all kinds of unreasonable abuse by the American imperialists, including searches, insults, detention, and imprisonment, which is truly an understatement. This is the shameless act that the rulers of so-called "civilized" and "free" America openly committed against a progressive scientist who loved his motherland in front of the people of the world.

    Professor Zhao Zhongyao went to the United States in the spring of 1946 to visit the atomic bomb explosion test on Bikini Island. He successively conducted pure scientific research on atomic nuclear physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Washington Carnegie Institute, and the California Institute of Technology. Last March, he eagerly hoped to return to China to serve the people's motherland. At that time, when he was at the California Institute of Technology, he was secretly monitored by agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Someone hinted to him: "You better not go back, to avoid trouble." But Professor Zhao Zhongyao is a scientist who loves his motherland, and his determination to return to the country cannot be affected by any persecution by American imperialism. On August 29 last year, after he obtained a transit permit from the Hong Kong government, he boarded the President Wilson in Los Angeles with more than 120 fellow students who had studied in the United States and excitedly embarked on the journey back to the motherland. However, plainclothes agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation tracked him down. They repeatedly questioned him and searched him. Under the pretext of inspecting prohibited export items, they detained all of Professor Zhao's physics books and important notes on atomic nuclear physics that he had carefully studied for several years.

    On the morning of September 12 last year, when the President Wilson arrived in Yokohama, Japan, he was immediately unreasonably interrogated by personnel from the Yokohama Intelligence Department of the U.S. Imperialist Occupation Forces Headquarters in Japan. That night, Professor Zhao Zhongyao and Luo Shijun and Shen Shanjiong, two students who graduated from the California Institute of Technology, were detained and escorted to the Nakano U.S. military prison in Tokyo in prison cars. They were told: "You know why we only arrested people from the California Institute of Technology!" and told them that the famous Chinese aeronautics authority, Professor Qian Xuesen, had already been detained in the United States. The next morning, U.S. imperialist agents even escorted them to the Sugamo Prison, where Japanese war criminals were detained, in handcuffs and shackles. They were forced to wear single prison uniforms printed with six "P"s and were locked in three separate cells. Professor Zhao was in cell number 18, Comrade Shen was in cell number 19, and Comrade Luo was in cell number 40. In this way, they lived a completely inhuman prisoner life like the nearly three hundred other Chinese prisoners in this prison. Filled with incomparable resentment, they repeatedly demanded that their problems be resolved as soon as possible, but the American imperialists repeatedly delayed. An agent from the U.S. Intelligence Department in Tokyo told them: "We received a telegram from the Sixth Army of the U.S. military in Los Angeles. This is executing an order from Washington, and we have no right to handle it." At the same time, Professor Zhao personally witnessed Japanese war criminals being released one by one by the U.S. occupation forces.

    During the forty-seven days of prison life, what disgusted them the most was the shameless Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's delegation in Japan. These guys pretended to be "concerned" and repeatedly lured and threatened them, asking them to go to Taiwan, saying to them: "The American authorities attach great importance to this case, but if you are willing to go to Taiwan, things will be easier." Professor Zhao replied very simply: "We will never consider going to Taiwan, we want to return to free China."

    In a helpless situation, the U.S. imperialist agents notified them on October 28 that they could be released from prison, but then sent them to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's delegation in Japan, where they were monitored by agents. The "delegation" personnel tried to pull them to Taiwan again, but they were all sternly rejected by them.

    It was not until November 15 that they were freed and moved to the Gajoen Hotel in Japan. At that time, they saw on an offset-printed overseas Chinese newspaper the words of the scientific community in the motherland angrily protesting their unreasonable persecution. They felt infinite excitement and comfort, and they more eagerly looked forward to returning to the embrace of the great people's motherland as soon as possible. Five days later, they left Yokohama.

    On November 27, they were unreasonably monitored by British police in Hong Kong for one night, and on November 28, they finally returned to the free motherland.

    Professor Zhao Zhongyao was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people when he passed through Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Nanjing. He said that he would participate in the work of the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and work with everyone to lay the foundation for atomic science research in New China.

    When talking about his feelings and thoughts about returning to the motherland, Professor Zhao Zhongyao was full of infinite excitement and joy. He said that what moved him the most was the warm welcome and cordial condolences he received from the people everywhere. He saw the spirit of enthusiastic service and unity of the people of the motherland today, as well as the great national self-esteem and self-confidence shown everywhere, which were all scenes he had not seen in the past. He saw that the friends in the scientific community of the motherland today are all so enthusiastic about work and study, and are freely researching and engaging in practical construction work under the help and leadership of the People's Government. This made him compare what he saw in the United States in the past four years with the persecution of progressive scientists by the American government. For example, at the University of California, more than one hundred professors and teachers were immediately unreasonably dismissed by the school for not participating in the oath declaring that they were not communists. The famous scientist Einstein was warned by the American authorities for supporting peace. And some progressive scientists who were forced to participate in national defense scientific research lost their freedom. In such a comparison, he has infinite love and hope for New China.

　　访问赵忠尧教授
    柏生
    为中国人民所深切关怀的我国留美著名原子物理学家赵忠尧教授，已于一月十七日来到了北京。他在归国途中，受着种种迫害，并在日本被美帝无理扣押监禁四十七天。
    年已四十八岁的赵忠尧教授，洋溢着青年人的热情和饱满的精神，他亲切而愤激地谈起被美帝无理迫害的经过。他从去年三月起就准备回国，整整经过了五个月的留难，才得到顺从美帝意旨的香港政府的过境许可证。去年八月他从美国洛杉矶上船，直到去年十一月底回到祖国，一共费了九个月的时间。在这中间，他受到美帝国主义者的搜查、污辱、扣押、监禁等种种无理虐待，真是一言难尽。这就是所谓“文明”“自由”的美国的统治者，在全世界人民面前明目张胆地对一个热爱祖国的进步科学家所干的无耻勾当。
    赵忠尧教授是一九四六年春天前往参观比基尼岛原子弹爆炸试验时去美国的，曾先后在麻省理工学院、华盛顿卡乃几学院、加里佛尼亚理工学院做纯科学的原子核物理学研究。去年三月，他便热望回国，为人民的祖国服务。当时他在加省理工学院，就有美国联邦调查局的特务暗中监视他的行动。曾有人向他暗示说：“你最好不要回去，免得麻烦。”但是赵忠尧教授是热爱祖国的科学家，他的回国的决心，不是美帝国主义的任何迫害所能影响的。去年八月二十九日，他得到香港政府的过境许可证后，就在洛杉矶登上威尔逊总统轮，与同轮的一百二十余位留美同学兴奋地踏上归国的途程。可是美国联邦调查局的便衣特务追踪来了，他们再三盘问他，搜查他，借口检查违禁出口物品，把赵教授所有物理学书籍和他数年来精心研究原子核物理的重要笔记，一一扣留下来。
    去年九月十二日清晨，威尔逊轮抵达日本横滨时，立刻又被美帝驻日占领军总部横滨情报部人员无理查问，并在当夜把赵忠尧教授和在加省理工学院毕业的罗时钧和沈善炯两位同学扣留，用囚车押送到东京中野美军监狱，对他们说：“你们知道我们为什么单抓加省理工学院来的！”并告诉他们：著名的中国航空学权威钱学森教授已经在美国被拘留。第二天上午，美帝特务们更用铐镣把他们押解到拘禁日本战犯的巢鸭监狱。他们被迫穿上了印着六个“Ｐ”字的单囚服，分别关在三个牢房里，赵教授在第十八号监房，沈同学在第十九号，罗同学在第四十号。就这样，他们跟关在这个牢狱里的其它将近三百个中国犯人一样，完全过着非人的囚徒生活。他们怀着无比的愤恨，几次要求从速处理他们的问题，但是美帝一再拖延。一个美国驻东京情报部的特务告诉他们说：“我们是接到洛杉矶美军第六军的电报，这是执行华盛顿的命令，我们无权处理。”而同时赵教授却亲眼看到日本战犯一个个被美占领军释放。
    在四十七天的监狱生活中，最使他们感到厌恶的是无耻的蒋匪帮驻日代表团。这些家伙装着一副“关怀”的样子，几次利诱威胁他们，要他们去台湾，对他们说：“美国当局对这件案子看的很重，但如果你们愿意去台湾，事情就好办了。”赵教授很干脆地回答说：“我们决不考虑去台湾，我们要回到自由中国去。”
    美帝国主义特务们在无可奈何的情形下，在十月二十八日通知他们可以出狱，但是又把他们送到蒋匪驻日代表团处，受着特务监视。“代表团”人员又想把他们拉到台湾去，但都被他们严辞拒绝了。
    到了十一月十五日，他们才获得自由，搬到日本雅叙园旅舍去住。当时他们从一份油印的华侨民报上看到了祖国的科学界在愤怒地抗议他们被无理迫害的文字，他们感到了无限的兴奋和安慰，他们更迫切的盼望着早日回到伟大的人民祖国的怀抱。五天后，他们离开了横滨。
    十一月二十七日在香港又被英警察无理监视了一晚，二十八日终于回到了自由的祖国。
    赵忠尧教授经过广州、上海、南京时，受到了广大人民的热烈欢迎。他说他将参加中国科学院近代物理研究所的工作，和大家一起，为新中国的原子科学研究工作打基础。
    谈起回到祖国的心情和感想时，赵忠尧教授充满着无限的兴奋和愉快。他说最使他感动的是他到处受到人民热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。他看到了今天祖国人民这种热心服务和团结一致的精神，以及到处表现出来的伟大民族自尊心和自信心，这都是过去他所没有看到的情景。他看到今天祖国科学界的朋友们，个个人都是那么热心工作与学习，在人民政府的帮助与领导下自由研究和从事实际建设工作，这使他对比起四年中在美国所看到的，美国政府迫害美国进步科学家的情形。譬如在加州大学有一百余位教授和教员因为未参加宣誓声明自己不是共产党，就立刻遭到校方无理解聘。著名科学家爱因斯坦因为拥护和平而受到美国当局的警告。而一些被强迫拉去参加国防科学研究工作的进步科学家，都失去了自由。在这样的对比之下，他对新中国更怀着无限的热爱和希望。（附图片）
