Having overcome natural disasters, the grain and cotton production increase plan was overfulfilled; the agricultural production in non-disaster areas throughout the region has returned to pre-war levels, and disaster areas have exceeded the 1949 production level.

Cang County Special District Agricultural Construction Section

Achievements

The entire region has 9,067,023 mu of cultivated land. The unfavorable conditions for production in 1950 were: 50% of the region suffered from flooding in 1949, causing a severe spring famine in 1950; 80% of the wheat suffered from pests and diseases; various insect plagues occurred on 3 million mu of autumn fields, and 1.5 million mu were flooded. However, thanks to the leadership of higher authorities, the efforts of cadres at all levels, the enthusiasm of the masses for production, coupled with timely cultivation, improved techniques, river management and drainage, water conservancy development, pest eradication, and favorable rainfall, great achievements were made in overfulfilling the grain and cotton production increase plan. The entire region harvested a total of 1,263 million jin of raw grain, excluding cash crops. Non-disaster areas have recovered to pre-war levels, and disaster areas have exceeded the 1949 production level. The entire region planted a total of 374,343 mu of cotton. The average yield of seed cotton was 81 jin per mu, exceeding the original plan by 6 jin; together with other special crops, this is equivalent to 177 million jin of grain. The total output is equivalent to 1,440 million jin of grain, close to double the total output of 1949, exceeding the 1,250 million jin grain production task assigned by the province. In addition, with the production of reeds, fish, salt, and other sideline industries, the total grain production in the entire region in 1950 was 1.5 billion jin. After deducting living consumption, public grain, loan repayments, and production investment, there is still a surplus of 115 million jin of grain. The purchasing power of the rural areas has increased significantly, and there are good conditions for expanding reproduction.

Situation

I. The principle of "production leadership running throughout the year and being the central task overriding everything" was implemented. First, the thinking of cadres at all levels was unified, and the strength of governments and economic departments at all levels was concentrated to fully support spring plowing during the severe spring famine and to work hard around the annual grain and cotton production increase task; all practices that deviated from or hindered this central task were effectively corrected and struggled against. Second, in-depth inspection work was carried out seriously, and a large number of personnel were organized to go to the countryside every season. Therefore, the coercive command style was basically overcome, and bureaucratic phenomena in the work were reduced.

II. Through various representative conferences and repeated publicity at any time and place regarding various policies such as "Protecting the Fruits of Labor," "Burden," "Employment," "Loans," and "Rewards," and implementing them in practical work, the production enthusiasm of the masses was enhanced, and some people's one-sided erroneous ideas of agricultural socialism were dispelled. Farmers boldly invested in the land. The fertilization situation this year was generally more than one cart of fertilizer per mu, with some reaching one and a half or two carts; some areas also applied a large amount of top dressing (70% of households in the region carried out top dressing on late-maturing fields). Dong Qichang, a farmer from Heliulin Village, cultivated 25 mu of land and applied 51 carts of coarse fertilizer and 900 jin of fine fertilizer throughout the year. Junziguan Village alone borrowed more than 10,000 jin of fine fertilizer. To improve production, the masses actively purchased livestock. The People's Bank loaned 899.82 million yuan, driving private capital of 758.55 million yuan to purchase 2,478 head of livestock. With the addition of local livestock breeding (except in disaster areas), the average number of draft animals has reached pre-war levels (but the quality is poor). Land prices have risen by one-third to one-half. Many areas have restored short-term labor markets. According to incomplete statistics from four counties including Jianguo, 114 short-term labor markets have been restored and established. Through appraisal, the movement to elect labor models was launched, and 1,531 village labor models emerged. Among these labor models, 701 participated in the labor model conferences in their respective counties, and 33 participated in the provincial labor model conference. The emergence of labor models not only illustrates the direct result of the implementation of various policies, but they also set up banners on different production fronts.

III. Victory in the struggle against natural disasters:

Victory over floods: Due to careful organization, 250,000 laborers were mobilized in the spring of 1950 to complete 1.6 million cubic meters of earthwork, laying the foundation for the victory in flood control in 1950. During the summer flood season, due to early (June) deployment and full preparation, an unprecedented flood that overtopped the dikes by 32 li and waves exceeding the top of the dikes by one and a half feet was overcome, achieving the result of no breaches in the main and secondary rivers throughout the region. In order to actively and systematically drain the accumulated water, joint drainage headquarters were organized in Qingxian, Cangxian, Huanghua, Jianguo, Jiahe, and Xianxian (the above counties are: Qingxian, Cangxian, Huanghua, Jianguo County, Jiahe County, Xianxian), basically avoiding drainage disputes and ensuring the smooth progress of drainage work. The seven counties dug 64 drainage ditches, draining the accumulated water from 1,359,303 mu of land, accounting for 85% of the total flooded land. In particular, the excavation of the Cangqinghuang Langwa drainage road transformed 110,000 mu of long-term waterlogged land into fertile fields.

Transforming dry land into paddy fields: The Shuiyuesi in Cangxian, Zhangfuzhuang in Huanghua County, and the Hejian and Renqiu canal projects have been initially completed, capable of irrigating 36,775 mu of land. After winter watering, 5,284 mu of land have been irrigated. In addition, 353 new wells were drilled throughout the year, and 1,797 waterwheels were loaned, which can turn 15,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields.

Eliminating insect plagues: This year, wheat field fire spiders, locusts, aphids, stem borers, green caterpillars, and other insect pests occurred successively on 3 million mu of land. Under the slogan of "timely capture and elimination on the spot," major cadres at all levels personally participated in the leadership, and the masses captured and eliminated them, preventing them from becoming a disaster.

IV. Unifying economic forces and effectively supporting production. During the severe spring famine, the Grain Company pre-loaned 22 million jin of coarse grain to the masses, solving the difficulties of production and living materials at that time. Supply and Marketing Cooperatives purchased a large number of agricultural and sideline products, including: more than 26.3 million jin of crude saltpeter, 763,691 bolts of homespun cloth, 128,837 pockets, 223,352 jin of saltpeter, more than 40 jin of powder balls, and 450,000 jin of vegetable oil. The People's Bank successively loaned 1,821,643 jin of seeds, 1,700,929 jin of fertilizer, 2,560 head of livestock, and 4,984 pieces of agricultural implements, equivalent to 6.08 million jin of rice (including 395,766 jin of grain loaned for well drilling). The above measures have effectively supported spring plowing and year-round production.

V. Improving agricultural technology. Throughout the year's production, technical cadres at all levels and departments helped the masses in various ways to improve agricultural technology and launched a top-down technical learning movement. For example, in Hejian, 336 county and district cadres learned seed selection techniques during the autumn harvest. Cadres leading agricultural production have begun to change their style of only making calls and not participating in actual leadership, which will facilitate the development of future work. In terms of technology promotion, the special district systematically held two technical training classes, training more than 200 agricultural cadres from counties and districts. At the same time, each county used temple fairs to hold spring and autumn agricultural production exhibitions, exchanged experiences, and established grassroots organizations for technology promotion with emphasis. At present, the farm directly controls 81 key promotion villages and 375 promotion households, with 77 technical research groups. The entire region promoted 193,760 jin of improved varieties of seeds (wheat, cotton), 276,795 seedlings of improved sweet potatoes such as Victory No. 100, and 6,614 jin of insecticides. Seed selection exceeded previous years. Some crops have reached the level of self-selection and self-use. In Suning County, 32,906 households in 204 villages selected seeds this year, totaling 115,658 jin of millet, more than double the amount selected in 1949 (39,168 jin selected in the county in 1949), which is enough to plant 92,500 mu (100,9915 mu of millet were planted in the county in the spring of 1950). Adding the millet seeds selected by the 24 uncounted villages, it is estimated that there is enough for the sowing needs in 1951. Among them, 34,196 households (97% of the total households) selected 126,07 jin of cotton seeds. About 50% of the households in the region soaked their seeds. The degree of cultivation is generally two plows and three rakes, and a few are three plows and four rakes; spring seedlings are hoed three to four times, and special crops are hoed five to seven times, which is generally one more plowing and hoeing than in previous years.

VI. Increase in productivity and expansion of mutual aid organizations. After extensively mobilizing the masses and carrying out glorious labor propaganda and education, in each main season, in addition to all male laborers being put into production, an average of 70% of female laborers also participated in production. According to statistics from 245 villages in 9 counties, there are a total of 200,281 female laborers, with 141,345 participating in production, exceeding last year by 10%. According to the investigation of one district in Renqiu and 23 villages in Jianguo, 160 landlords, rich peasants, and vagrants who have been reformed have been put into production. The number of households in the entire region participating in mutual aid organizations has reached more than 30% of the total number of households. According to the investigation of 46 villages in Suning and Huanghua counties, among 8,106 households, there were originally 437 mutual aid groups with 1,631 households. This year, 300 groups with 1,048 households were newly added. The number of households organized in 43 villages accounts for more than 33% of the total number of households.

Self-Criticism

I. Bureaucracy in leadership: It is mainly manifested in insufficient grasp of the situation and blindly making big plans, resulting in the work not being well completed. For example, the original plan was to open 25 canals and irrigate 200,000 mu of land, but only three were completed, irrigating 36,000 mu; the plan was to drill 2,000 wells, but only 353 were completed; wheat seed selection was not based on the severity of wheat jaundice, and the arrangements were not appropriate, but required every household to select seeds. As a result, according to the investigation of 878 villages in seven counties, only 35% of the total number of households selected seeds. The second is the careless style of work. For example, due to improper germination rate testing and inspection when lending spring wheat seeds, the germination rate was very low after the seeds were lent. For example, in Qingxian, only 30% of the seedlings grew in 3,300 mu of wheat fields; and only 20% of the 20,000 jin of Si-character cotton seeds issued to the county germinated. This caused a loss of material and the government's political prestige to the masses.

II. The labor mutual aid is still only staying on the call for voluntary combination, lacking specific organization, and falling into laissez-faire. Therefore, it is impossible to improve the mutual aid organization on the original basis. The original mutual aid organizations are generally staying at the low-level primitive form of mutual aid. At the same time, there is a lack of in-depth inspection, failure to discover new problems, insufficient understanding of organization, and emphasis is placed on solving the lack of manpower and animal power, ignoring how to improve and consolidate it. For example, some areas have experienced the phenomenon of disbanding and working alone. In particular, when new class changes occur in a few areas and poor peasants appear, it is impossible to improve production through labor mutual aid to prevent the risk of bankruptcy of poor peasants.

III. Governments at all levels have not sufficiently implemented the policy of cultivating labor models and establishing production banners, which has resulted in the failure to improve the original labor models, and even the collapse due to poor leadership. In the selection of new labor models, they are not cultivated in a planned way, but only use the method of "pulling generals from a team of dwarfs." In short, it has not yet been recognized that selecting labor models to establish banners is a new method of leading production by implementing the mass line.

IV. In some areas, the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has not been sufficiently implemented, and cadres and the masses have a poor sense of political vigilance, and are very paralyzed by the landlord's counterattack and the sabotage of bad elements. As a result, a burning field incident occurred during the autumn harvest. Although it was handled in a timely manner afterwards, it caused undue losses to the masses.

V. In terms of improving agricultural technology, it mainly cannot keep up with the demands of the masses. For example, the cultivation of cotton, the promotion of insecticides, appliances and new agricultural implements, especially the prevention and control of wheat jaundice, have not been able to meet the needs of the masses. Most cadres lack agricultural scientific knowledge and technology, can only talk about it, and have no practical methods. Therefore, it is difficult to change the old ideas and old habits of the masses (such as some masses are afraid that soaking seeds will burn them to death), and even some cadres erroneously promote agricultural technology in an ignorant way.

    一九五零年农业生产总结
    战胜了灾荒，超额完成粮棉增产计划；全区非灾区农业生产已恢复了战前水平，灾区超过了一九四九年生产水平。
                 沧县专署农建科
           成绩
    全区共有耕地九百零六万七千零二十三亩。一九五○年生产的不利条件是：全区于一九四九年有百分之五十的地区遭受水灾，造成了一九五○年的严重春荒；小麦有百分之八十遭受病虫害；三百万亩秋田发生了各种虫灾，以及水淹地一百五十万亩。但由于上级的领导，各级干部的努力，群众生产的热情，加上耕作适时，技术提高，治河排水，发展水利，捕灭虫灾，以及雨水调和，获得了超额完成粮棉增产计划的巨大成绩。全区除经济作物外，共收原粮十二亿六千三百万斤。非灾区恢复了战前水平，灾区超过了一九四九年生产水平。全区共种棉三十七万四千三百四十三亩。每亩平均产籽棉八十一斤，超过原计划六斤；连同其他特种作物，共折粮一亿七千七百万斤。总产量折粮十四亿四千万斤，接近一九四九年总产量的一倍，超过省分配的十二亿五千万斤粮食生产任务。此外，再加上苇、鱼、盐等副业生产全区一九五○年总产粮食十五亿斤。除生活消费、公粮、归还贷款及生产投资外，尚可余粮一亿一千五百万斤。农村购买力已显著提高，扩大再生产也有了良好条件。
            情况
    一、贯彻了“生产领导贯彻全年，并为压倒一切的中心任务”的方针。首先统一了各级干部的思想，集中了各级政府和经济部门的力量，全力支持了严重春荒下的春耕，并围绕全年粮棉增产任务而努力；对一切脱离或妨害这一中心任务的作法，都进行了有效的纠正和斗争。其次，认真进行了深入的检查工作，每一季节都曾组织了大批力量下乡。因此，基本上克服了强迫命令作风，并减少了工作中的官僚主义现象。
    二、通过各种代表会议及随时随地的反复的宣传《保护劳动所得》、《负担》、《雇佣》、《借贷》、《奖励》等各种政策，并在实际工作中加以贯彻，因而提高了群众的生产情绪，打消了某些群众片面的农业社会主义的错误思想。农民都大胆地向土地投资。今年施肥情况，一般为每亩施肥一车以上，多者达一车半或两车；部分地区并大量上追肥（全区有百分之七十的户进行了晚田追肥）。河柳林村农民董其昌，种地二十五亩，全年除上粗肥五十一车外，并追施细肥九百斤。君子馆一村即贷细肥一万余斤。为了提高生产，群众积极购买牲口。人民银行曾贷款八亿九千九百八十二万元，带动私资七亿五千八百五十五万元，购买牲口二千四百七十八头，加上当地牲畜的繁殖（灾区除外），平均耕畜数量已达战前水平（但质量差）。地价上涨三分之一到二分之一。不少地区恢复了短工市，据建国等四个县不完全的统计，共恢复与建立短工市一百一十四处。通过评比，开展了选举劳动模范运动，共出现村劳动模范一千五百三十一名。这些劳动模范中有七百零一名参加了各该县的劳动模范大会；并有三十三名参加了全省劳动模范大会。劳动模范的出现，不仅说明是各种政策贯彻的直接结果，而且他们在不同的生产战线上树起了旗帜。
    三、向自然灾害斗争的胜利：
    战胜水灾：由于组织周密，一九五○年春天，共动员二十五万民工，完成了一百六十万方土的工程，打下了一九五○年防汛胜利的基础。夏汛中，由于提前（六月份）布置，和准备充分，战胜了平漫堤顶三十二华里，惊涛骇浪超过堤顶一尺半的史无前例的洪水，获得全区主次河流无一决口的成绩。为主动而有计划地排泄积水，曾组织了青沧黄、青沧建、交献（以上各县为：青县、沧县、黄骅、建国县、交河县、献县）等联合排水指挥部，基本上避免了排水纠纷事件，保证了排水工作的顺利进行。七个县共挖泄水沟六十四道，排出一百三十五万九千三百零三亩土地的积水，占全部被淹土地的百分之八十五。尤其沧青黄浪洼排水路的开挖，使长年积水的十一万亩洼地变为良田。
    变旱地为水田：已初步完成沧县水月寺，黄骅县张福庄及河间、任邱水渠工程，共能浇地三万六千七百七十五亩。放冬水后已浇地五千二百八十四亩。此外，全年共打新井三百五十三眼，贷出水车一千七百九十七辆，可使一万五千亩旱地变成水田。
    消灭虫灾：今年在三百万亩土地上，曾陆续发生麦田火蜘蛛、蝗虫、蚜虫、钻心虫、大青虫等虫害。在“及时捕打，就地消灭”的口号下，各级主要干部亲自参加领导，群众捕打，未使成灾。
    四、统一经济力量，有效地支援了生产。在严重的春荒时期，粮食公司以粗粮二千二百万斤，预借给群众，解决了当时生产和生活资料的困难。供销社大量收购了农、副业产品，计：皮硝二千六百三十多万斤，土布七十六万三千六百九十一匹，口袋十二万八千八百三十七条，火硝二十二万三千三百五十二斤，粉团四十余斤，植物油四十五万斤。人民银行先后贷放籽种一百八十二万一千六百四十三斤，肥料一百七十万零九千二百二十九斤，牲口二千五百六十头，农具四千九百八十四件，共折米六百零八万斤（包括打井贷粮三十九万五千七百六十六斤），上述措施，均有效地支持了春耕和全年生产。
    五、提高农业技术。在全年生产中，各级、各部门的技术干部，通过各种方式帮助群众，提高了农业技术，并开展了自上而下的学技术运动。如河间在秋收中，有三百三十六个县、区干部学会了选种技术。领导农业生产的干部，开始转变了只做号召、不参加实际领导的作风，便利了今后工作的开展。技术推广方面，专区有计划地举办了两次技术训练班，训练了县、区农业干部二百余名。同时，各县利用庙会举办了春秋农业生产展览会，交流了经验，有重点地建立了技术推广基层组织。现仅农场直接掌握的推广重点村就有八十一个，推广户三百七十五户，技术研究小组七十七个。全区共推广优良品种（小麦、棉花）种籽十九万三千七百六十斤、胜利百号等优良山芋二十七万六千七百九十五株，以及杀虫药剂六千六百十四斤。选种超过往年。有些庄稼已达到自选自用的程度。肃宁县二百零四个村共三万五千二百零九户，今年有三万二千九百零六户进行了选种，共选谷子十一万五千六百五十八斤，超过一九四九年（一九四九年该县共选三万九千一百六十八斤）两倍，能种九万二千五百亩（一九五○年春该县共种谷子十万零九千九百一十五亩），再加上未统计的二十四个村所选的谷种，估计足够一九五一年播种需用。其中并有三万四千一百九十六户（占总户的百分之九十七）选棉种十二万六千零七斤。浸种户全区约达百分之五十左右。耕作程度一般为耕二耙三，少数耕三耙四；春苗锄三至四遍，特种作物五至七遍。普遍比往年多耕锄一遍。
    六、生产力的增加与互助组织的扩大。经过广泛发动群众并进行劳动光荣的宣传教育后，在每个主要季节中除男劳力全部投入生产外，平均有百分之七十的女劳动力也参加了生产。据九个县二百四十五个村的统计，共女劳动力二十万零二千八百十一名，参加生产者十四万一千三百四十五名，超过去年百分之十。据任邱一个区、建国二十三个村的调查，经过改造的地主、富农、二流子一百六十人已投入生产。全区参加互助组织的户已达总户的百分之三十以上。据肃宁、黄骅两县四十六个村的调查，八千一百零六户中，原有互助组四百三十七个、一千六百三十一户，今年新增加了三百个、一千零四十八户，四十三个村已组织起来的户数，占总户数的百分之三十三强。
            检讨
    一、领导上的官僚主义：主要表现在掌握情况不够，盲目作大计划，致使工作不能很好完成。如原计划开渠二十五道，浇地二十万亩，结果只完成三道，浇地三万六千余亩；计划打井二千眼，只完成三百五十三眼；小麦选种，没根据小麦黄疸病的轻重，适当布置，而要求户户选，结果，据七个县八百七十八个村的调查，选种户只占总户数的百分之三十五。其次是工作中的粗枝大叶作风。如春麦贷种，因对发芽率试验检查不当，致贷出后出生率很低。如青县三千三百亩麦田，只有百分之三十发芽成长；贷发该县斯字棉籽二万斤，只发芽百分之二十。这就造成了群众物质的与政府政治威信的损失。
    二、对劳动互助还只停留在自愿结合的号召上，缺乏具体组织，而陷于自流。因此不能使互助组织在原有基础上提高一步。原有的互助组织，一般都停留在低级的原始的互助形式上。同时缺乏深入检查，未能发现新的问题，对组织起来的认识不足，偏重为解决人、畜力缺乏的一方面，忽视了如何使之提高与巩固。如有的地区发生散伙单干的现象。特别是当少数地区发生新的阶级变化而出现贫农时，未能通过劳动互助提高生产，以防止贫农破产的危险。
    三、各级政府对培养劳模、树立生产旗帜的方针贯彻不够，致使原有的一部分劳模不能提高，甚至有因领导差而垮台的。在选拔新的劳模方面，也不是有计划地去培养，只是用“矮子队里拔将军”的办法。总之，还没认识到选拔劳模树立旗帜是贯彻群众路线的新的领导生产的方法。
    四、有的地区对镇压反革命分子政策贯彻不足，干部、群众的政治警惕性较差，对地主反攻和坏分子的破坏，甚为麻痹。致秋收中曾发生烧场事件。事后虽经及时处理，但已造成群众的不应有的损失。
    五、在提高农业技术方面，主要是赶不上群众的要求。如棉花的栽培，杀虫的药剂、用具和新式农具的推广，尤其是小麦黄疸病的防除法等，都未能满足群众要求。大部分干部缺乏农业科学知识和技术，只能口头讲，没有实际办法，因此，就难以转变群众的旧思想、旧习惯（如有的群众怕浸种会把种子烫死），甚至有的干部强不知以为知地错误地宣传农业技术。
