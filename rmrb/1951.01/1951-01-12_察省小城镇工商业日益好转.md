Xinhua News Agency: Since July of last year, the industry and commerce of small towns throughout Chahar Province has been improving daily.

Since the adjustment of industry and commerce in May 1950, the fall in prices has stopped and stabilized. Chahar Province's industry and commerce began to improve in July, and entered a prosperous period in September. At this time, traveling merchants and peddlers decreased, while seated merchants increased. Due to stable prices and normal business operations, many traveling merchants who used to speculate in price fluctuations could no longer profit and were forced to turn to legitimate operations. Peddlers exceeding market needs also had to turn to production or become seated merchants.

Another significant phenomenon of the improvement of industry and commerce in small towns of Chahar Province is the substantial increase in industries that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood and meet the needs of farmers, and the reduction in industries that exceed market needs. According to statistics from nine small cities and towns in the Chahan South area: the metal manufacturing industry opened more businesses than closed, while the grain processing industry closed more businesses than opened. The pharmaceutical industry increased significantly: 59 households opened and 19 closed in half a year.

In the process of improvement, the industry and commerce of small towns in Chahar Province more obviously displayed seasonal characteristics, and business success or failure completely depended on the agricultural production season and the abundance of the harvest. For example, the oil pressing and flour milling industries are in the off-season between spring and summer and seem excessive, but after the autumn harvest, when the peak season arrives, they request to open businesses one after another. Cloth, cotton, and groceries have a good season in the fall. Compared with the business volume of general merchants in the province during the off-season and peak season, the higher ones have increased by as much as fifty times. Some semi-agricultural and semi-commercial traveling merchants return to their hometowns for production in summer and autumn, and open for business again in winter and spring. The province's industrial and commercial departments have appropriately controlled the situation according to seasonal characteristics and local actual needs to avoid blindly approving the opening of businesses, resulting in mutual congestion. At the same time, they have also paid attention to preventing the shortcomings of rigidly limiting them.

In order to develop the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the Chahar State-owned Trading Company has established institutions and carried out business in small cities and towns, focusing on key areas. With the state-owned economy as the leader, public-private consultation, and correct mastery of price policies, it has further driven the improvement of private commerce. When the business of the state-owned trading company initially extended to small towns, many private merchants worried that private businesses would collapse from then on. However, after more than half a year of practical experience, private merchants in various small towns have realized that: without the acquisition of state-owned companies, the private turnover will immediately decrease.

### 察省小城镇工商业日益好转

　　察省小城镇工商业日益好转
    【本报讯】新华社讯：察哈尔全省小城镇的工商业从去年七月以来日益好转。
    察哈尔全省小城镇的工商业，自一九五○年五月份调整工商业以后，物价止跌转稳，察省工商业从七月份就开始好转，九月以来更进入旺月，这时行商摊贩减少，座商则日益增加。由于物价稳定，营业正常，许多惯于在物价波动中投机的行商已无暴利可图，被迫转向正当经营；超过市场需要的摊贩也不得不转向生产或改为座商。
    察省小城镇工商业好转的另一个显著现象是有利国计民生、适合农民需要的行业大为增加，超过市场需要的行业减少。根据察南专区九个小城、镇的统计：金属制造业开业多于歇业，粮食加工业歇业多于开业。医药业显著增加：半年内开五十九户，歇十九户。
    察省小城镇工商业在好转过程中较明显地表现了季节性的特点，营业好坏完全随农业生产季节和年景丰歉为转移。例如榨油制粉等业在春夏之交是淡月，就显得过剩，秋收后旺月到来又纷纷请求开业。布、棉、杂货在秋后则有一季好买卖。以该省一般商户淡、旺月的营业额相比，高者有增达五十倍的。有一些半农半商的行商摊贩，夏秋回乡生产，冬、春又开张营业。该省工商部门曾根据季节性特点和当地实际需要，适当掌握，以避免盲目地随便准予开业以致发生互相拥挤的现象；与此同时，又注意防止了死硬地加以限制的缺点。
    察哈尔国营贸易公司为了开展城乡物资交流，曾在小城、镇有重点地建立机构，开展业务，并以国营经济为领导，公私协商，正确掌握价格政策，因之更加带动了私营商业的好转。当国营贸易公司的业务初步伸展到小城镇时，不少私商顾虑私商将从此垮台。但经过半年多的实际体验以后，各小城镇的私商已经认识到：如果没有国营公司的收购，私人营业额便会立刻减少。
