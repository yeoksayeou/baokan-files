　　Beijing People's Relief Representative Conference Concludes
    Beijing Branch of the China Relief Association Established
    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing People's Relief Representative Conference was held on January 19th and 20th, and the Beijing Branch of the China People's Relief Association was formally established.
    Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, delivered a report to the conference on the relief and welfare work in Beijing over the past two years. Chai Zemin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, gave a report on the issues of cultural education, relief organizations, and religious groups accepting foreign subsidies. At the opening of the conference, Chen Qiyuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, and Pu Huairen, representative of the China People's Relief Association, respectively elaborated on the principles and direction of the new China's relief and welfare undertakings to the conference.
    Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu stated in his report: Beijing was a city occupied by the enemy for a long time in North China and was liberated relatively late. Therefore, before liberation, a large number of disaster victims, refugees, and unemployed people floated in society, and the lives of the general people were extremely impoverished. In 1949, as soon as Beijing was liberated, we immediately carried out emergency relief. First, we provided relief to the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and cadres who were in extremely difficult circumstances due to the destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries, as well as poor citizens who had no means of subsistence. The first distribution of relief grain totaled more than 430,000 catties. Secondly, we subsidized and evacuated the five thousand refugees who had been displaced in the city during the war to return to their hometowns. From May 1949, we began to centrally house beggars. After the first concentrated roundup, professional beggars were basically eliminated; later, we continued to concentrate and house them, a total of seven times, accumulating more than 6,400 people. Except for those who were gradually dealt with by organizing labor brigades and sending them back to their hometowns, as of the end of 1950, 2,337 people had been housed. Because we have adopted the policy of continuous containment and labor reform for beggars, we have greatly improved the social order of the city.
    Over the past two years, the government has taken various measures to help unemployed workers, unemployed intellectuals, and ordinary poor citizens find employment or change careers, as well as providing other temporary relief. According to incomplete statistics, the government directly introduced employment to more than 4,000 people. In particular, since July of last year, according to the instructions of the State Council on relieving unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals and the decision of the Beijing People's Representative Conference on relieving unemployed workers, an Unemployment Relief Committee was established. A comprehensive survey of unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals in the city was conducted, and a comprehensive and systematic relief effort was launched. According to the survey at the time, there were still more than 10,000 unemployed workers, but by the end of last year, 4,260 people had been employed. Now, according to the survey, there are less than 5,000 unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals who have not yet found employment. In addition, a general survey of ordinary poor citizens in the city was also conducted in July 1950. According to the statistics at the time, there were 6,802 households and 18,975 people. In addition to actively helping them find employment, change careers, return to their hometowns for production, and immigrate, the main relief methods adopted were work-for-relief, self-reliance through production, and vocational training to help them overcome difficulties and prepare for employment. Those who were in particularly difficult circumstances and could not change careers were given direct relief grain. In addition, special care was given to the lives of poor families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres. Over the past two years, we have adopted a policy of combining organized production, job placement, and in-kind preferential treatment to appropriately solve their livelihood problems. Twenty-seven types of production have been organized, with sixty-six units and more than 5,000 participants. Regarding disaster relief, in addition to providing relief to disaster victims who have flowed into the city, we have twice invited representatives from various democratic parties and all sectors of society to form a "Relief Committee" and a "Winter Clothing Fundraising Committee" to launch fundraising campaigns among the general public to help other disaster areas. The two campaigns totaled more than 290 million yuan in cash, more than 120,000 catties of grain, more than 197,000 pieces of clothing, more than 3,900 catties of cotton, and more than 23,000 other miscellaneous items. In addition, after closing the brothels, the prostitutes who were gathered together underwent universal treatment for venereal diseases. We also helped them find spouses, find jobs, and return to their hometowns, and those who remained were organized for production. While carrying out relief work, we also carried out some necessary and possible social welfare undertakings. Such as free clinics, free hospitalization, and free childbirth for poor working people, and universal free vaccinations and injections. Since liberation, the number of nurseries has increased from ten to sixty-nine, and the number of children cared for has increased from 340 to 2,780, and rural nurseries have been piloted with emphasis. All these relief and welfare undertakings have been participated in or supported by the broad masses of the people; therefore, the huge social disasters left to us by the reactionary rule have been alleviated, which proves that the Chinese people have the power to do a good job in their own relief and welfare undertakings.
    In their speeches at the conference, the representatives unanimously supported the principle of "self-reliance through production, social mutual assistance, and government subsidies" for people's relief and welfare undertakings, and expressed their willingness to unite the capital's relief and welfare circles to form a strong relief force to completely eliminate the cultural aggression of American imperialism.
    The conference discussed and adopted Deputy Mayor Zhang's report, and passed a resolution: to take the report made by Vice Premier Dong Biwu of the State Council of the Central People's Government at the China People's Relief Representative Conference on April 26 last year regarding the "new China's relief and welfare undertakings" as the program of action for Beijing's relief and welfare work in the future.
    Before the closing of the conference, the organizational rules of the Beijing Branch of the China People's Relief Association were adopted, and the executive committee and supervisory committee of the branch were elected. At the same time, three telegrams were passed to pay tribute to Chairman Mao, Chairman Song Qingling of the China People's Relief Association, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

　　京人民救济代表会议闭幕
    救总京市分会成立
    【本报讯】北京市人民救济代表会议，于一月十九、二十两日举行，并正式成立了中国人民救济总会北京市分会。
    北京市人民政府张友渔副市长向大会作了北京市二年来的救济福利工作的报告。市府副秘书长柴泽民作了关于接受外国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体问题的报告。会议开幕时，中央人民政府内务部副部长陈其瑗、中国人民救济总会代表浦化人都分别向大会阐述了新中国救济福利事业的方针和道路。
    张友渔副市长在报告中称：北京市是在华北为敌人盘据较久解放较晚的城市，故在解放前，社会上漂浮着大量的灾民、难民和失业人口，一般人民的生活也极度贫困。一九四九年，北京市刚一解放，我们立即进行了急赈。首先，是救济在国民党反动派摧残之下，生活极度困难的烈士家属，革命军人家属和干部家属，以及生活上完全无着的贫苦市民。第一次共发救济粮的四十三万余斤。其次，把战争进行期间流落在城市的五千余难民资助疏散还乡。从一九四九年五月起，即开始集中收容乞丐。第一次突击收容之后，已基本上肃清了职业性的乞丐；以后又陆续集中收容，前后共七次，累计达六千四百余人。除以组织劳动大队资遣还乡等办法陆续处理者外，截至一九五○年底已收容有二千三百三十七人。由于我们对乞丐采取不断地收容和劳动改造的方针，已大大改善了城市的社会秩序。
    对失业工人、失业知识分子及一般贫苦市民，两年以来政府采取了各种办法帮助就业或转业，及进行其他的临时救济。仅由政府直接介绍就业的，据不完全统计约达四千余人。特别是从去年七月，根据政务院救济失业工人和失业知识分子的指示和市各界人民代表会议关于救济失业工人的决定，成立了失业工人救济委员会。对全市失业工人和失业知识分子进行了全面的调查，并开展了全面的有系统的救济工作。根据当时调查尚有失业工人万余人，但至去年年底就业的已达四千二百六十余人。现在，根据调查，失业工人和失业知识分子确实还没有就业的，不足五千人。此外，对于城市一般贫苦市民在一九五○年七月份也进行了普遍调查，根据当时统计有六千八百零二户，一万八千九百七十五人。救济的办法，除积极帮助就业转业，还乡生产，移民之外，主要采取了以工代赈，生产自救，转业训练等方法，来帮助其渡过困难和准备就业的条件。其中生活特别困难而又不能转业的，采取了直接发放救济粮的办法。此外，对于穷苦的烈、军、干属的生活予以特殊的关怀。两年以来我们采取了组织生产、介绍职业与实物优待相结合的方针，适当解决他们的生活问题。已经组织起来的生产有二十七种、六十六个单位、参加五千余人。关于灾民救济，除了对流入城市的灾民进行救济外，并两次邀请各民主党派各界代表组成“救济委员会”和“寒衣募集委员会”，发动广大市民展开募捐运动帮助了其他灾区。两次合计共募集现金二十九万万余元，粮食十二万余斤，衣服十九万七千余件，棉花三千九百余斤，其他杂项物品二万三千余件。此外，在封闭妓院后，对于集中起来的妓女进行了普遍的性病治疗。并帮助她们择配、找工作、还乡，余下的又组织她们进行生产。在进行救济工作的同时也进行了一些必要的和可能的各种社会福利事业。如贫苦劳动人民的免费门诊、免费住院及免费接生，普遍地进行免费预防接种和注射等。解放以来，托儿所已由十所增至六十九所，受托儿童由三百四十人增加到二千七百八十人，并重点试办了农忙托儿所。以上这些救济事业和福利事业，都是得到广大人民群众参加或支持的；因此使反动统治所遗留给我们的巨大的社会性的灾难减轻了，这证明了中国人民是有力量来办好自己的救济事业和福利事业的。
    代表们在大会发言中一致拥护“生产自救、社会互济、政府补助”的人民救济福利事业的方针，表示愿团结首都救济福利界结成一支坚强的救济队伍，彻底肃清美帝国主义的文化侵略。
    会议讨论通过了张副市长的报告，并通过决议：以中央人民政府政务院董必武副总理去年四月二十六日在中国人民救济代表会议所作的关于“新中国救济福利事业”的报告作为今后北京市救济福利工作的行动纲领。
    大会在闭幕前通过了中国人民救济总会北京市分会组织规程，并选举了分会的执行委员会和监察委员。同时通过了向毛主席、中国人民救济总会宋庆龄主席、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军致敬的三个电文。
