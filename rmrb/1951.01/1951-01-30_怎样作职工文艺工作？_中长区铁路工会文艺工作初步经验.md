　　How to Do Literary and Artistic Work for Employees?
　  ——Preliminary Experience of the Railway Trade Union Literary and Artistic Work in the Central-South District
    Zhao Xinye, Liu Wantang
    (1) Short, Concise, Self-Composed and Self-Performed
    In the past six months, we have learned from our work that the principle of "short, concise, self-composed and self-performed, and carrying out education in light of the ideological situation of employees" is correct.
    In the past, the performances of amateur theater troupes often neglected production, and sometimes even took up working hours; moreover, they all liked to perform large-scale dramas, such as "Liu Hulan," "Red Flag Song," "Shell," "Revenge," "Steel Bones and Iron Tendons," etc. As a result, the actors were busy all day long, unable to sleep well or eat well, becoming dizzy and unable to do administrative work well. The foremen were dissatisfied, saying that they were there to "idle around," and gave them fewer points during salary evaluation. The troupe members were afraid that performing would reduce their wages, so they were unwilling to do it.
    In view of this situation, we corrected the past deviations, organized employees to write about their own affairs and perform their own affairs under the principle of being short and concise, and closely coordinated with production tasks in terms of content (such as the Shenyang Electrical Section compiling and singing dramas based on the monthly administrative tasks). Because what was being performed were the workers' own affairs, everyone was familiar with them and willing to watch. This directly promoted production. At the same time, it did not cost much to perform, it did not take a lot of time to rehearse, and the administration also supported this work.
    As a result, all forty-seven theater troupes (including choirs) in the district have been consolidated, and literary and artistic activities are very active. Even remote small stations can see plays performed by the workers themselves.
  (2) Combining Production with Ideological Education
    In the past six months, we have united employees and carried out ideological education through literary and artistic activities. For example, in order to ensure winter transportation tasks, the Shenyang Locomotive Depot administratively put forward the slogan of "Eliminating Accidents," but some drivers lacked confidence, believing that accidents could only be eliminated if the trains did not leave the depot. The theater troupe wrote the play "Singing the No. 25 Locomotive" based on this situation. Leaders and workers praised the play, and some drivers and stokers said: "We must learn from the No. 25 locomotive and strive to become iron bull team members." The communication line maintenance team of the Shenyang Electrical Section, in August last year, due to the small number of people and many tasks, the workers were not confident in completing the tasks. The theater troupe performed "Singing the Maintenance Team" for them. After watching, everyone said: "The trade union really cares about us, and organized a theater troupe to comfort everyone. If we don't work hard, we will really let everyone down." As a result, they completed the task twenty days ahead of schedule, and saved 1,000 labor days and 30 electric poles. After the establishment of the China Changchun Railway, in order to encourage everyone to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and build the China Changchun Railway into a model railway for the whole country, plays such as "What Exactly to Learn from Him?" "Singing the China Changchun Railway," and "Singing the 500 Kilometer Daily Car Movement" were performed. The play "Who is to Blame?" was also performed to criticize the phenomenon of lax labor discipline.
    In the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country, various theater troupes performed plays such as "In Battle," "Flames of Anger," and "Such is America" to conduct ideological education for employees. The Mudanjiang and Hailar sub-bureaus organized amateur theater troupes to brave wind and snow to promote at various work areas and small stations. Workers at the Bamiantong Station said after watching the play: "In the past, I always thought that the Korean War had little to do with us, but now it is really clear that there will be no peace without defeating U.S. imperialism."
  (3) Competition, Rewards, and Promotion of Literary and Artistic Works
    Several drama competitions have proved that competition is the best way to organize mass literary and artistic activities. Through competition, literary and artistic activities can be universally organized and popularized to remote stations and work areas; and some good literary and artistic works and forms can also be discovered in the competition, so that we can concentrate these good literary and artistic works and forms and promote them.
    In terms of the form of competition, we feel that the decentralized method is better than the centralized method, because under this method, the participating units can be wider, and it is also convenient and does not delay administrative time. However, within a certain period, the centralized competition method of districts or sub-bureaus is still necessary.
    So, how to encourage the creative enthusiasm of workers? Rewards are a good way. During the China Changchun Railway Drama Competition held in August last year, more than a dozen scripts such as "Accidents Specifically Find Careless People" appeared. Relatively successful works were rewarded and published. This solves the problem of the lack of scripts for amateur theater troupes.
  (4) Assistance from Soviet Experts
    In August last year, Soviet experts helped us hold the railway-wide drama competition. From this meeting, we learned the "bottom-up" competition method from station sections to sub-bureaus to the entire bureau, which expanded the scope of literary and artistic activities. We cultivated and improved the drum music, martial arts, and magic tricks that are popular with the masses, and made them a regular organizational form of club activities.
    In addition to cultivating national forms of literary and artistic activities, Soviet experts taught us how to do solo singing and dancing, and introduced Soviet folk dances to China. Various clubs organized various literary and artistic groups, expanding the field of literary and artistic activities and improving literary and artistic techniques, such as organizing literary and artistic training classes, running women's theater troupes, and establishing embroidery groups. Since then, we have found the way to literary and artistic work.

　　怎样作职工文艺工作？
　  ——中长区铁路工会文艺工作初步经验
    赵欣野　刘万堂
    （一）短小精悍，自编自演
    半年来，我们从工作中体验到“短小精悍，自编自演，针对职工思想情况进行教育”的方针是正确的。
    以前业余剧团的演出，往往忽视生产，有时还占用工作时间；而且都喜欢演大戏，如《刘胡兰》、《红旗歌》、《炮弹》、《复仇》、《钢骨铁筋》等剧。因此，演员一天忙到晚，睡不好觉，吃不好饭，弄得头昏眼花，行政工作也干不好。工长就不满意，说他们是来“泡蘑菇”的，评薪时少给分。团员怕演戏降低工资，也就不愿意干了。
    针对这种情况，我们纠正了过去的偏向，在短小精悍的原则下，组织员工写自己的事演自己的事，在内容上紧紧配合生产任务（如沈阳电务段把每月的行政任务编戏演唱）。因为演的是工人自己的事，大家都很熟悉，而且愿意看。这样就直接推动了生产。同时，演戏时不用多花钱，排戏不需要很多时间，行政上也支持这一工作。
    因此，全区四十七个剧团（包括合唱队）巩固下来了，文艺活动搞得很活跃，连偏僻的小站也能看到工人自己演出的戏了。
  （二）结合生产进行思想教育
    半年来，我们通过文艺活动，团结了职工，并对职工进行了思想教育。如沈阳机务段行政上为了保证冬季运输任务，曾提出“消灭事故”的口号，但个别司机缺乏信心，认为要消灭事故除非车不出库。剧团就根据这个情况，写出了《歌唱二十五号火车头》一剧。领导上和工友看了这个戏之后都称赞不已，有些司机和司炉说：“咱们要向二十五号火车头看齐，争取作铁牛队员。”沈阳电务段通讯线路包修组，在去年八月份因人手少，任务多，工友们对完成任务没有信心，剧团就对他们演出了《歌唱包修组》。大家看后都说：“工会真关心咱们，组织剧团来慰问大伙，要不好好干，真对不起大家”。结果提前二十天完成任务，而且节省小工一千个，电柱三十根。中长铁路成立后，为了鼓励大家学习苏联的先进经验，把中长路办成全国的模范铁路，曾演出了《究竟跟他学啥？》、《说唱中长路》、《歌唱日车五百公里运动》等剧本。并演出《到底怨谁？》一剧，批评劳动纪律松弛的现象。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，各个剧团演出了《在战斗中》、《愤怒的火焰》、《如此美国》等剧，向职工进行思想教育。牡丹江、海拉尔两个分区组织了业余剧团，冒着风雪到各工区小站宣传。八面通站工友看了戏之后说：“过去我总以为朝鲜战争和咱们关系不大，这回可真清楚了，不打败美帝就没有和平。”
  （三）竞赛、奖励与推广文艺作品
    数次戏剧竞赛，证明了竞赛是组织群众文艺活动的最好办法。通过竞赛，能够很好地把文艺活动普遍地组织起来，并把文艺活动普及到偏僻的小站和工区；而一些好的文艺作品和文艺形式也就能在比赛中被发现出来，使我们能把这些好的文艺作品、文艺形式集中起来推广下去。
    在竞赛的方式上，我们觉得分散的方式较集中的方式好，因为在这个方式下参加的单位可以广泛一些，而且又方便，不耽误行政时间。但在一定的时期内，区或分区的集中竞赛方式仍是必要的。
    那末，怎样鼓舞工友的创作热情呢？奖励是一个好办法。去年八月举行中长全路戏剧竞赛时，曾出现了“事故专找马虎人”等十余种剧本，对较成功的作品则给以奖励，出版。这样就解决了业余剧团的剧本荒问题。
  （四）苏联专家的帮助
    去年八月，苏联专家帮助我们举行了全路的戏剧比赛。从这个会上，我们学会了由站段而分局而全局的“由下而上”的竞赛办法，扩大了文艺活动的范围。我们把优良的群众所喜闻乐见的鼓乐、武术、魔术加以培植，加以提高，成为俱乐部经常活动的一种组织形式。
    除了培养民族形式的文艺活动之外，苏联专家教我们搞独唱、舞蹈，并把苏联的民间舞介绍到中国来。各俱乐部就组织了各种文艺小组，扩大了文艺活动的领域和提高了文艺技术，如组织文艺训练班、办妇女剧团、成立刺绣组等。从此，我们找到了文艺工作的门径。
