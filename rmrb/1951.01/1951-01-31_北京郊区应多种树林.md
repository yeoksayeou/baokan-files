　　More Forests Should Be Planted in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Comrade Editor:
    The winter in Beijing is cold, and there is a lot of sand and dust when the wind blows. If more trees were planted in the four suburbs of Beijing, perhaps the natural environment of Beijing could be changed. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant authorities learn from the Soviet Union's plan to transform nature and build more forests around Beijing.
                Reader Liang Kupiao
    Comrade Liang Kupiao:
    Regarding your suggestion to build more forests in Beijing to transform the natural environment of Beijing, we have forwarded it to the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government, and now we have received the following reply from the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation:
    (1) The planting of protective forest belts and farmland windbreak networks can transform the local natural environment and increase agricultural production. Because such protective forest belts and windbreak networks can reduce wind speed and weaken evaporation, allowing moisture in the soil to be preserved, making the soil freezing depth shallower, and reducing the rapid temperature difference. The sandstorms in Beijing mainly come from the Yongding River sandy land. Building protective forests in the Yongding River sandy land and on both sides of the river can reduce sandstorms and improve the climate.
    (2) The establishment of protective forests should first understand the climatic factors, and then select appropriate tree species to plant in appropriate areas. This year, it is planned to conduct preliminary observation and research on climatic factors. As for the general afforestation work in Beijing, the Beijing Municipal Gardening Administration has already started it in 1950.

### 北京郊区应多种树林

　　北京郊区应多种树林编辑同志：
    北京的冬天，气候严寒，而且一刮大风，沙尘很多。如果在北京四郊多种些树木，或者可以改变北京的自然环境。因此，我建议有关机关学习苏联的改造自然的计划，在北京外围多造树林。
                读者  梁苦飘梁苦飘同志：
    你提出在北京多造树林以改造北京的自然环境的意见，经我们转致中央人民政府林垦部后，现已得到林垦部的答复如下：
    （一）防护林带及耕地防风林网的栽植，可以改造局部自然环境，并增加农业产量。因为这样的防护林带和防风林网可以减低风速，并减弱蒸发作用，使土壤中的水分得以保存，使土壤冻结深度较浅，并使气温急剧差度减小。北京的风沙，主要是从永定河沙地吹来的，在永定河沙地及河两岸造防护林，就可以减少风沙改进气候。
    （二）防护林的设置，首先应了解气候因子，然后再选择适当的树种，种于适当的地带。本年度拟对气候因子作初步观测研究。至于京市一般的造林工作，北京市林园管理处已于一九五○年开始进行。
