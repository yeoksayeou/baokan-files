Column: Response to People's Daily Criticism

To the Editors:

    In the People's Daily issue of December 23rd of last year, the reader Li Yuliang stated in his article "Why Did Jianxing Construction Firm Fire Me?" that Chief Wang of the Central Anti-Epidemic Team's General Affairs Section did not promptly address his report that Zhang Shirong, manager of Jianxing Construction Firm, was instigating workers to steal lumber. Instead, Chief Wang said the report was inaccurate and that the reporter should be educated. After investigation, our team did indeed construct housing around late June of last year. At the very beginning of construction, Wang Anjiu, deputy chief of the General Affairs Section of our team, who was responsible for supervision, discovered that the capitalist was instigating workers to steal lumber from the original building materials. He immediately stopped it and educated the capitalist. However, at that time, we believed that if we pursued the matter immediately, the project would inevitably be halted. The anti-epidemic personnel training class that our team was planning to open, and the large amount of medicine exposed outdoors, would suffer serious damage if they were exposed to prolonged rain. Therefore, in addition to strengthening supervision, we decided to deal with the matter after the completion of the project.

    In August, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Workers' Daily, and the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau successively reported this situation to our team. Comrade Wang Anjiu explained the process and proposed handling suggestions. Because their report differed slightly from what we understood, we requested further assistance in detailed investigation and requested instructions on how to handle it. On October 25th, the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau replied to our team with the results of their investigation. On December 8th, we transferred Zhang Shirong, manager of Jianxing Construction Firm, to the court for handling through public security organs and withheld his deposit. At the same time, we sent a letter to the Workers' Daily, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Labor Bureau to report the situation, and we also reported to the Central Ministry of Health.

    We believe that Comrade Li Yuliang's courage to report the scum who destroy people's property is a concrete manifestation of patriotism and should be commended. The responsible comrades of our team, especially Comrade Wang Anjiu, who was responsible for supervising the project, were not careful enough in supervising and inspecting the project, causing the capitalist to cut corners and damage state property. Moreover, because they did not rely enough on the working class and failed to deal with the matter in a timely manner, but only emphasized the one-sided interests of our unit at the time, they should all conduct a profound self-criticism.

### 中央防疫总队关于不虚心接受工人意见的检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评的反映

    中央防疫总队关于不虚心接受工人意见的检讨编辑同志：
    人民日报去年十二月二十三日刊载了读者李玉良《建兴营造厂为什么解雇我》稿中称：中央防疫总队总务科王科长对其反映建兴营造厂经理张士荣嗾使工人偷锯木料，并未即时处理，反而说反映不确，应当受教育等语。经查本队去年六月下旬确曾修建房屋，在刚开工时，负责监工之本队总务科副科长王安九，即发现资方嗾使工人偷锯原建筑木料，当即予以制止，并对资方进行了教育。但当时我们以为如果及时追究，工程势必停顿。而本队正拟开办之防疫人员训练班，及露天放着的大批药材，如受霪雨之浸袭，均将遭受严重之损失，故除加强监工外，乃决定于工程完竣后，再行议处。
    八月间北京市总工会、工人日报及北京市劳动局先后向本队反映这个情况，当由王安九同志面告经过及处理意见，因其反映情况与我们了解略有不同，遂请求进一步协助详确调查，及请求指示处理办法。十月二十五日北京市劳动局函复本队调查经过。十二月八日，我们将建兴营造厂经理张士荣经公安机关移送法院处理，并扣留其押款。同时将经过情况函达工人日报、北京市总工会及劳动局，并报告中央卫生部。
    我们认为工人李玉良同志勇于检举破坏人民财产的败类，是爱国精神的具体表现，应予以表扬。本队负责同志，特别是负责监工的王安九同志，对工程监督检查不细心，造成资方偷工减料破坏国家财产的损失，又因依靠工人阶级的思想不够，没能及时处理，而只强调本单位当时的片面利益，都是应该深刻检讨的。
