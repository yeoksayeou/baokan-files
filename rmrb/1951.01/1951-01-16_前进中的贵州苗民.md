　　The Advancing Miao People of Guizhou
    Guo Qing
    I
    The Miao people of Guizhou will never forget the memorable day of November 15, 1949. From that day on, the Miao people of Guizhou, like other ethnic groups in Guizhou, ended the dark rule of the Chiang and Gu (Gu Zhenglun) bandit gangs and gained liberation. Like other ethnic groups in the country, they stood up forever and became masters of the country.
    The Miao people of Guizhou will also forever remember the brutal acts of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang against them. Before liberation, the ethnic minorities of Guizhou—the Miao and Yi people—suffered for a long time from the contempt and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Kuomintang reactionaries forced them to regress, forced them to become ignorant and backward. The culture of the Miao people of Guizhou was very low before liberation. Among the four million ethnic minorities in Guizhou, only about three thousand had attended school; the illiteracy rate was over 99 percent. The Kuomintang reactionaries were extremely hostile to the Miao compatriots and insulted them. The Miao people were driven into the deep mountains and forests, forced to eat mountain potatoes and wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger; naked and living with wild animals.
    The Miao people of Guizhou suffered the disasters of conscription, looting, and exorbitant taxes imposed by the Chiang bandit gang. Duyun County is the area with the largest Miao population. Here, the Miao people account for 80 percent of the total population of the county. In just four months in 1943, the Chiang bandit gang conscripted more than 200 young men in one township. Miao man Wang Mingzhen sold his only twenty *tiao* of land (each *tiao* of land yields 40 *jin* of rice annually) to avoid conscription. In recent years, the Chiang bandit gang conscripted more than 100,000 young men from the Miao people of Guizhou. The Kuomintang reactionaries also sowed discord and undermined unity among ethnic groups, causing ethnic groups to hate and discriminate against each other, which made it easier for them to rule.
    II
    The People's Government and the People's Liberation Army correctly implemented the ethnic policy that "all ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China have equal rights and obligations." The situation in which ethnic minorities were discriminated against and oppressed for thousands of years has been completely changed. The liberated Miao people of Guizhou deeply realized that the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army are representatives of their interests. All party, government, and military personnel greatly respect their customs and habits, do not casually borrow their things, and do not live in their houses, especially their ancestral temples.
    April 18th is the Qingming Festival for the Miao people of Guiyang. More than 2,000 Miao people went to the bronze statue platform in the city to dance. On this day, the Guiyang Municipal People's Government specially screened movies for the Miao people; state-owned trading companies also sold goods at low prices to give preferential treatment to ethnic minorities.
    All the facts after liberation told the ethnic minorities that only the Communist Party and the People's Government are their backers and saviors. Among the Miao and other ethnic minorities, the concerns of being afraid of cutting hair, cutting skirts, being insulted, and not daring to go to market for a long time (that is, the northern "赶集") during the Kuomintang era have been eliminated, and they appear in cities and towns in groups. The Miao people freely hold gatherings such as "bullfights" and "rocking horse *lang* (摇马朗)" (social gatherings for young Miao men and women) according to their own customs. The liberated Miao people of Guizhou, in the big family of their motherland, under the banner of Mao Zedong, share a life of freedom and democracy like other ethnic groups. Whenever there are festivals or conferences, the Miao people, like people all over the country, hold high portraits of Chairman Mao, play musical instruments, and sing to their heart's content. Here are a few lyrics created by the Miao people themselves after liberation, with which they expressed their love for the motherland and Chairman Mao:
    "Guiyang is liberated,
    The people have turned over;
    Miao and Yi people, come on,
    Participate in the grand parade.
    Our team is like the Yangtze River,
    Ten thousand miles of rushing,
    Like the Yangtze River, it will never run out,..."
　
   "The Miao people are liberated and turned over,
   The Communist Party protects us,
   Unite us together,
   Kill Chiang bandits and enjoy peace.
   With the Communist Party,
   Leading the Miao and Yi towards the light."
   "The pomegranate is red when the sun comes out,
   China produced a Mao Zedong;
   He is the great leader of the people,
   Saved us from the fire pit.
   Oh, we will forever enjoy peace,
   Thank you for Mao Zedong's great kindness."
    III
    Under the leadership and assistance of the local Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army, the Miao people of Guizhou established their own armed forces—joint defense teams or self-defense teams—to fight against the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs and secret agents, implement home defense and self-defense, and carry out production.
    In the past year, the armed self-defense struggle of the Miao and Yi people has been fruitful. They took out their own earthen guns and spears, and stood guard day and night; they frequently contacted the government and troops and took the initiative to attack bandits. In the townships of Jichang, Yanghe, Mingmo, and Bagu in Duyun County alone, Miao compatriots in more than 60 villages established joint defense teams. They also formulated joint defense rules and drank the unity wine, expressing their determination to jointly suppress bandits. In May last year, more than 400 bandits burned houses, killed pigs, pulled cattle, and looted in Longchang Village. After discovering this, the Miao people's joint defense team fired guns and attacked, repelling the bandits. The Miao people in Wan Township, Lushan County, organized a Miao people's joint defense team of more than 400 people, repelling seven attacks by more than 400 bandits and ensuring the safety of the people in the entire township. Many Miao people said, "As long as the People's Government supports us, we are not afraid of anything!" In their active struggle against bandits and special agents, they established a relatively stable social order.
    After obtaining a relatively stable life, the Miao people actively engaged in production and reclamation. They began to cultivate land that was left barren by the Kuomintang district and township bureaucrats; in the past, they had no right to reclaim land for production. The People's Government supported the Miao people in production and led them to organize mutual aid production groups. The People's Government distributed 52,000 *jin* of production loan grain in the four townships of Yanghe, Mingmo, Jichang, and Bagu in Duyun County alone. As a result of the reclamation in the above four townships, the cultivated area doubled. These measures of the People's Government have begun to improve the long-term impoverished life of the Miao people.
    IV
    In order to strengthen the work of ethnic minorities, the People's Government pays attention to training ethnic minority cadres in areas where ethnic groups live together (ethnic minorities in Guizhou are all living together in mixed areas) and absorbs ethnic minority people to participate in various tasks. Among the 200 people sent by Lushan County to the special office for training, 70 percent were ethnic minorities. Of the 325 students in the peasant activist training class run by the county, 238 were Miao people. There are more than 170 ethnic minority students studying at the Guiyang branch of the Southwest People's Revolutionary University. In the five townships of Changqing, Longquan, Yangwu, Jinzhong, and Xingren in Danzhai County, the pseudo-bao-jia system was abolished one after another, and the masses themselves elected village chairmen and village peasant association chairmen; in 42 villages, Miao people in more than 30 villages were elected as village chairmen and village peasant association chairmen. Many Miao compatriots actively participated as members of district and township peasant associations. For example, among the 19 members of the first district peasant association, 13 were Miao people. Many Miao farmers have been promoted to township and town heads due to their active work. It is the first time in the history of the Miao farmers in Guizhou to be township heads, town heads, and members.
    After the liberation of Guizhou, the People's Government absorbed a group of ethnic minority cadres to participate in the work. According to statistics from Guizhou Province, since liberation, 439 ethnic minority cadres have participated in government work at all levels. This is naturally still a small number, and now we are starting to absorb and train ethnic minority cadres in large numbers to participate in various national construction tasks. In areas with large ethnic minority populations, such as Guiyang City, Huangping, Guizhu, Longli, Xingren, Zhenfeng, Anshun, and more than a dozen other counties, county ethnic affairs committees have been established. Wang Shaoxian, a Miao compatriot from Yangming Township, Xiuwen County, said: "When the Kuomintang was here, our young people could not come to the city to go to market, and we could not even enter their government (referring to the Kuomintang government); now, the People's Government treats us very well and welcomes us to come to the government... they give us food to eat and clothes to wear, it's so good!"

　　前进中的贵州苗民
    郭青
    一
    贵州的苗族人民，永远不会忘记一九四九年十一月十五日这个可纪念的日子，从这天起，贵州的苗民像贵州其他民族一样终止了蒋、谷（谷正伦）匪帮的黑暗统治，获得了解放。他们与全国其他民族一样，永远站立起来，作了国家的主人。
    贵州的苗族人民也永远记着蒋介石匪帮对他们的残暴行为。在解放之前，贵州的少数民族——苗、彝人民，长久地遭受着国民党反动派的鄙视与压迫，国民党反动派强使他们倒退，强使他们走向愚昧与落后。贵州苗族人民在未解放之前的文化是十分低落的。贵州四百余万少数民族中，进过学校的只有三千人左右；文盲占百分之九十九以上。国民党反动派对苗胞极端仇视并予以侮辱。苗族人民被赶到深山丛林中去，被迫以山薯、野菜充饥；赤身裸体，与野兽为伍。
    贵州苗族人民遭受过蒋匪帮抓丁、抢掠、苛捐杂税的灾难。都匀县是苗民最多的地方。这里苗民占全县总人口的百分之八十。仅一九四三年四个月间，蒋匪帮在一个乡里就抓去壮丁二百多名。苗民王明贞为避免抓丁卖去了仅有的二十挑田（每挑田常年产量为四十斤稻谷）。近几年来，贵州苗民被蒋匪抓走的壮丁共有十万多人。国民党反动派还挑拨离间，破坏民族间的团结，使民族之间互相仇视、歧视，这样会便于他们统治。
    二
    人民政府与人民解放军正确地执行了“中华人民共和国境内各民族，均有平等的权利和义务”的民族政策，几千年来少数民族被歧视、压迫的情况完全改变了。解放了的贵州苗民深刻地认识了共产党、人民政府、人民解放军是他们的利益的代表者。党、政、军的一切工作人员，都极其尊重他们的风俗习惯，不随便借他们的东西，不住他们的房子，特别是他们的祖庙。
    四月十八日是贵阳苗民的扫墓节。二千多名苗民到城里铜像台跳舞。这天，贵阳市人民政府特别为苗民放映了电影；国营贸易公司也廉价售货优待少数民族。
    解放后的一切事实告诉了少数民族：只有共产党、人民政府才是他们的靠山，他们的救星。在苗族及其他少数民族中，已经消除了国民党时代的怕剪发、怕剪裙、怕受侮辱及长期不敢赶场（即北方的赶集）的顾虑，而成群结队地出现在城市、集镇上。苗族人民自由地按照着自己的风俗，举行“斗牛”、“摇马朗”（苗族青年男女的交际）等集会。被解放了的贵州苗民，在自己祖国的大家庭里，在毛泽东的旗帜下，与其他各民族一样分享着自由民主的生活。苗民每逢节日或大会，都像全国各地的人民一样高举着毛主席的像片，吹奏着乐器，尽情地歌唱。这里是苗族解放后自己创作的几首歌词，他们以此表达了对祖国及毛主席的热爱：
    “贵阳解放啊，
    人民大翻身；
    苗、彝民大家来啊，
    参加大游行。
    我们的队伍好比那长江水啊，
    万里大奔腾，
    好比长江水啊，永远流不尽，……”
　
   “苗民解放大翻身啊，
   共产党来保护下那（我们），
   下那团结起来啊，
   杀死蒋匪享太平。
   下那有了共产党啊，
   领导苗彝向光明。”
   “太阳出来石榴红，
   中国出了个毛泽东；
   他是人民的大领袖，
   救了我们出火笼。
   依呀，我们永久的享太平啊，
   感谢毛泽东的大恩情。”
    三
    贵州的苗民，在当地共产党、人民政府及人民解放军的领导与帮助下，建立了自己的武装——联防队或自卫队，与残余的蒋家匪帮、特务作斗争，实行保家自卫，开展生产。
    一年来苗、彝民的武装自卫斗争是有成绩的。他们拿出自己的土枪、梭标，不分昼夜地站岗放哨；经常与政府、部队取得联系并主动向土匪出击。仅都匀县的基场、阳和、明莫、坝固等乡即有六十多个寨子的苗胞建立了联防队。他们并订出了联防守则，喝了齐心酒，表示了共同剿匪的决心。去年五月间，有四百余名土匪在龙场寨烧房子，杀猪，拉牛，大肆抢劫。苗民联防队发觉后即鸣枪出击，将匪徒击退。炉山县湾水乡的苗民组织了四百余人的苗民联防队，击退了土匪四百余人的七次进攻，保全了全乡人民的安全。很多苗民都说：“只要人民政府给我们撑腰，我们什么也不怕！”在他们的积极对匪、特的斗争中，建立起比较稳定的社会秩序。
    苗民在得到比较稳定的生活之后，便积极生产开荒。他们开始垦殖着在国民党区、乡官僚们手里时任其荒芜的土地；过去他们是没有开荒生产的权利的。人民政府扶助苗民进行生产，并领导苗民组织生产互助小组。人民政府仅在都匀县的阳和、明莫、基场、坝固四个乡即发放了五万二千斤的生产贷粮。上述四乡开荒的结果，使耕地面积增加了一倍。人民政府的这些措施，已使苗民长久的贫困生活开始得到改善。
    四
    人民政府为了加强少数民族工作，在民族杂居地区（贵州少数民族均系杂居地区）注意培养少数民族干部，在各种工作中吸收少数民族人民参加。炉山县送专署受训的二百人中，百分之七十是少数民族。该县开办的农民积极分子训练班，三百二十五名学员中，苗民占二百三十八人。在西南人民革命大学贵阳分校学习的少数民族学员有一百七十多人。丹寨县长青、龙泉、杨武、金钟、兴仁等五个乡中，先后废除了伪保甲制度，由群众自己选举了村主席、村农民协会主席；在四十二个村中，有三十多个村的苗民被选作村主席、村农民协会主席。很多苗胞积极分子当了区、乡农民协会委员。如第一区区农民协会十九个委员中，十三个委员是苗民。并有不少苗族农民，由于工作积极，被提拔为乡、镇长。在贵州苗族农民中，当乡长、镇长、委员，是有史以来的第一次。
    贵州解放之后，人民政府吸收了一批少数民族干部参加了工作。贵州全省统计，解放以来参加各级政府工作的少数民族干部达四百三十九人。这自然还是很小的数目，现在正开始大量吸收、培养少数民族干部，以参加国家的各种建设工作。在少数民族人口多的地区，如贵阳市、黄平、贵筑、龙里、兴仁、贞丰、安顺等十余县内建立了县民族事务委员会。修文县阳明乡苗胞王绍先说：“国民党在这里，我们的青年人都不能到城里来赶场，他们的政府（指国民党政府），我们更进不去；现在，人民政府待我们很好，欢迎我们到政府中来……叫我们有饭吃，有衣穿，太好了！”
