Xinhua News Agency, Somewhere in North Korea, 4th: Our correspondent on the Korean front, Yuan Zheng, reports on the heroic deeds of the First Platoon of the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who were awarded the glorious title of "Anti-Tank Hero Platoon":

　　When a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers was pursuing the fleeing American troops southward, the Sixth Company was the vanguard. Company Commander Zhang Yuanhui decided to pursue the enemy's tanks and assigned the task of blasting them to the First Platoon.

　　They hadn't pursued them far when they heard the sound of motorcycles ahead. Six American tanks were lumbering down the highway. Zhang Yuanhui immediately led the entire company of brave soldiers to swiftly cut to the front side of the enemy tanks. When the enemy tanks approached, the light and heavy machine guns and rocket launchers of the Second and Third Platoons immediately opened fire, pinning the tanks down on the hillside.

　　At this time, the warriors of the First Platoon, holding bombs, pounced on the tanks like tigers.

　　Cui Ximing, the deputy squad leader of the First Squad, was the first to rush up. When he was only three or four steps away from a tank, he pulled the pin on the bomb and threw it into the tracks of the leading tank. With a bang, this tank was disabled.

　　The American infantry following behind the tank, seeing the situation was bad, fled in all directions. The warriors of the First Platoon, preoccupied with blasting the tanks, didn't bother to deal with these panic-stricken enemies. Wang Yaofu of the Third Squad and Liu Hanlai of the First Squad each threw a bomb at the second and third tanks, respectively. With a loud noise, the fuel tanks of these two tanks were hit and burst into flames.

　　Wang Yaofu was hit by fire from a tank behind him while throwing a bomb and gloriously sacrificed himself. Warrior Yu Kuiyun was immediately filled with vengeful fury. He charged straight at the tank that had killed Wang Yaofu, holding a bomb. He stuffed the bomb into the tank's tracks. Just as he took two steps back, the bomb fell out again. In this critical moment, he quickly picked up the bomb and stuffed it into the tank's tracks again, finally destroying the fourth tank.

　　At this time, the two tanks behind attempted to escape at full speed. Jin Kezhi, the deputy platoon leader of the First Platoon, threw two bombs in succession at the fifth tank, setting it on fire. The last tank was also destroyed by the dense fire and bombs of the Sixth Company's warriors.

　　In less than two hours, the warriors of the Sixth Company destroyed six American tanks. The leadership of a certain division of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to reward the brave soldiers for their illustrious achievements, awarded the Sixth Company a collective merit and the First Platoon a collective double merit, and conferred on them the glorious title of "Anti-Tank Hero Platoon".

　　“反坦克英雄排”
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地四日电】本社朝鲜前线通讯员元征报道我国人民志愿军某部第六连第一排荣膺“反坦克英雄排”的光荣称号的英雄事迹称：
    我国人民志愿军某部从院里追击南逃的美国溃军时，第六连是前卫连。连长张元会决定要追击敌人的坦克，他把爆炸的任务交给了第一排。
    他们追击不多远，就听见前面有摩托声。六辆美国坦克正在公路上蠕动。张元会立即带着全连勇士飞速地插到敌人坦克的前侧。待敌人的坦克接近后，第二、三排的轻、重机枪和火箭炮立即开火，把坦克制压在山腰里。
    这时，第一排的勇士们抱着炸弹，猛虎一般地向坦克扑去。
    第一班副班长崔希明是第一个冲上去的。他在离开坦克只有三、四步远时，就拔去炸弹上的保险器，把炸弹投进了为首的一辆坦克的履带中。轰隆一声，这辆坦克被炸得不能动弹。
    跟在坦克后面的美国步兵见势不好，纷纷东逃西窜。第一排的勇士们为了炸坦克，也顾不得去收拾这些仓惶逃命的敌人。三班的王耀福、一班的刘汉来分别向第二、第三辆坦克各投了一个炸弹。随着巨响，这两辆坦克的油箱被炸中而燃烧起来。
    王耀福在投炸弹时，被后面的一辆坦克的炮火射中而光荣牺牲。战士于奎云顿时冒起了复仇的怒火，他抱着炸弹直奔打死王耀福的那辆坦克。他把炸弹塞进了坦克的履带。当他刚后退两步时，炸弹又掉了出来。在这紧急的关头，他迅速地把炸弹抱起来，又把它塞进了坦克的履带，终于炸坏了第四辆坦克。
    这时，后面的两辆坦克企图开足马力逃跑。第一排副排长金克智接连向第五辆坦克扔去两个炸弹，炸得它起了火。最后的一辆坦克也被第六连勇士们的密集炮火和炸弹所炸毁了。
    第六连的勇士们在不到两个钟头内，炸毁了六辆美国坦克。我国人民志愿军某师领导机关为奖励勇士们的彪炳战绩，特给第六连集体记了一个大功，给第一排集体记了两个大功，并授予“反坦克英雄排”的光荣称号。
