Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions yesterday sent a telegram to French Prime Minister Pleven, protesting the French authorities' unreasonable and reactionary measures prohibiting the World Federation of Trade Unions from operating in France. The text of the telegram is as follows:
To Mr. Pleven, Prime Minister of France:
The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions believes that the French government's decision to declare the World Federation of Trade Unions illegal and order its headquarters to move out of France is an extremely crude violation of democratic principles and is outrageous.
The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions and now, on behalf of its five million members, demands that you change this decision and allow the World Federation of Trade Unions to continue to operate freely in France.
                                                                      All-China Federation of Trade Unions, January 29th.

Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: The All-China Youth Federation, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Students' Federation jointly issued a statement on January 29th regarding the French government's persecution of international democratic organizations. The full text of the statement is as follows:
At a time when American imperialism is actively rearming West Germany in Europe and establishing the so-called "European Army," the French government has ordered the prohibition of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth from operating on French territory. This reactionary measure by the French government is clearly instigated by American imperialism, attempting to destroy the organizations supported and loved by peace-loving people around the world and to obstruct the development of the peace movement. But this attempt will never be realized. This reactionary measure, besides illustrating the fear of the American and French imperialists of the people's peace forces and exposing their fascist and reactionary faces, will only make workers, women, and youth around the world more determined to fight for peace, and more widely and firmly unite around the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth.
We Chinese youth resolutely oppose the French government's unreasonable persecution of the three major international democratic organizations, and we will take practical actions to fully support all calls of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The American imperialist war of aggression in Korea has been disastrously defeated by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese Volunteer Army. The warmongers are becoming increasingly isolated in the eyes of the people of the world. We Chinese youth will, together with the youth of the world, wage unremitting struggle to defend peace, to defend international democratic organizations, and to implement the resolutions and calls of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth in action.

Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: The All-China Youth Federation, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Students' Federation, on January 29th, sent telegrams to French Minister of Interior Queuille, protesting the French government's unreasonable ban on the activities of the three major international democratic organizations and demanding the immediate revocation of the aforementioned reactionary decree. The original texts of each telegram are as follows:

(1) All-China Youth Federation telegram to Paris, Mr. Queuille, French Minister of Interior:
We express our great anger at the fascist action of the French government in stopping the activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in France, and its persecution of the peace and democratic movement in order to move towards war. The French government can never stop the activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which is organized by seventy million youth, nor can it prevent the World Federation of Democratic Youth from continuing to fight for the defense of world peace. We, on behalf of all the youth of the People's Republic of China, strongly protest the unreasonable measures taken by the reactionary French government and demand the immediate revocation of this decree that violates democratic rights and is hostile to the youth of all countries.
                                                                       All-China Youth Federation

(2) Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League telegram to Paris, Mr. Queuille, French Minister of Interior:
The China New Democratic Youth League and its three million six hundred thousand Youth League members protest with great indignation against the French government's tyrannical measures in carrying out the instructions of American imperialism and unreasonably prohibiting the World Federation of Democratic Youth from operating in France, and demand the immediate revocation of this reactionary decree.
                                                                  Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League

(3) All-China Students' Federation telegram to Paris, Mr. Queuille, French Minister of Interior:
The French government's unreasonable prohibition of the World Federation of Democratic Youth from operating in France through reactionary decrees is a measure that violates the interests of students worldwide and the cause of peace, and is an act of deliberately antagonizing the people of the world and students worldwide. Chinese students protest this action with great anger and demand the immediate revocation of this measure.
                                                                        All-China Students' Federation

　　我全国总工会、全国青联、青年团中央、全国学联
    反对法政府迫害国际民主组织
    分别致电普利文及葛义表示抗议
    【新华社三十日讯】中华全国总工会昨日致电法国总理普利文，抗议法国当局无理禁止世界工联在法活动的反动措施。电文如下：法国总理普利文先生：
    中华全国总工会的常委扩大会议认为法国政府宣布世界工联非法并勒令它的总部迁出法国的决定极端粗暴地破坏了民主原则，是令人愤慨的事。
    中华全国总工会是世界工联的会员，现在代表它的五百万会员要求你们改变这一决定，让世界工联继续在法国自由活动。
            中华全国总工会  一月二十九日
    【新华社二十九日讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华全国学生联合会二十九日联名对法国政府迫害国际民主组织发表声明。声明全文如下：
    当今天美帝国主义正在欧洲积极进行重新武装西德，建立所谓“欧洲军”的罪恶计划时，法国政府下令禁止世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会以及世界民主青年联盟等三大国际民主组织在法国领土上活动的反动措施。法国政府这一反动措施，显然受到美帝国主义的指使，企图摧毁世界爱好和平人民所拥护与热爱的组织，阻挠和平运动的发展。但这种企图是决不会实现的，这种反动措施，除了说明美法帝国主义者对人民和平力量的恐惧和暴露它们法西斯反动面目外，只会使得全世界工人、妇女与青年更坚决地为和平而斗争。更广泛与巩固地团结在世界工联、妇联与青联的周围。
    我们中国青年坚决反对法国政府对三大国际民主组织的无理迫害，我们要以实际行动来全力支持世界民主青年联盟的各项号召。美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略战争，已为朝鲜人民军与中国志愿部队打得惨败。战争贩子们在全世界人民面前已越来越孤立了。我们中国青年要和全世界青年一起，为保卫和平，为保卫国际民主组织，并为在行动中实现世界工联、妇联与青联的各项决议与号召而作不懈的斗争。
    【新华社二十九日讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华全国学生联合会，二十九日分别致电法国内政部长葛义，抗议法国政府无理禁止三大国际民主团体活动的措施，并要求立即撤消上述反动禁令。各电原文如下：
  （一）中华全国民主青年联合总会电巴黎  法国内政部长葛义先生：
    我们对法国政府停止世界民主青年联盟在法国境内活动的法西斯行动，以及它为了走向战争而加于和平民主运动的迫害，表示极大的愤怒。法国政府是绝不能停止由七千万青年所组织起来的世界民主青年联盟的活动的，也绝不能阻挡世界民主青年联盟继续为保卫世界和平而斗争的。我们代表中华人民共和国的全体青年严重抗议法国反动政府所采取的无理措施并要求立即撤消这项违反民主权利和敌视各国青年的禁令。
          中华全国民主青年联合总会
  （二）中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会电巴黎  法国内政部长葛义先生：
    中国新民主主义青年团及它的三百六十万青年团员，以极大的愤慨抗议法国政府执行美国帝国主义的指令，无理禁止世界青联在法活动的横暴措施，并要求立即撤消这一反动禁令。
          中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
  （三）中华全国学生联合会电巴黎  法国内政部长葛义先生：
    法国政府以反动法令无理禁止世界青联在法活动是违反全世界学生利益与和平事业利益的措施，是一心与世界人民、世界学生为敌的行为。中国学生以极大的愤怒抗议这一行动并要求立即撤消这一措施。
            中华全国学生联合会
