The People of Horqin Left Rear Banner, Inner Mongolia, Celebrate a Bumper Harvest: Adding Carts and Horses, Wearing New Clothes, and Eagerly Joining Cooperatives

[This article reports that] the farmers of Horqin Left Rear Banner (under the Jirem League, i.e., Horqin Left Rear Banner) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, enjoying a bumper harvest throughout the banner, are universally adding carts and buying cattle, and purchasing farm implements in preparation for this year's major production efforts.

Of the banner's more than 660 natural villages, 104 natural villages have added a total of 198 carts, 352 head of cattle, 63 donkeys, 14 horses, and mules, etc.

The Fifth District, which achieved a bumper harvest in rice paddy cultivation, has greatly increased its purchase of carts and horses to prepare the material conditions for this year's major production. For example, in addition to cultivating large fields, Xisheli Village grew rice on 17 hectares of land, yielding 300 *shi* of rice, while Jin Xiaopeng's five hectares of rice fields yielded 80 *shi*. Tegexi Baiyila grew rice on 1.3 *mu* of land and harvested 20 *shi* of grain. In addition to his original two head of cattle, he bought two more large steers. In just five natural villages in the district, a total of 31 carts were added. In Butun Halagen Village alone, with over 100 farming households, 20 carts and 20 head of cattle have been purchased. In other areas, cart additions are widespread, such as in the First District, where 14 natural villages added 56 carts. In the First Village of the Tenth District, in mid-November 1950, 108 head of cattle, four large iron carts, and ten local wooden carts were purchased all at once. In Baiyintao Hai Natural Village, 40 households have bought 40 head of cattle and ten carts. Furthermore, in Tiebuke Village in the Third District, eleven carts and ten head of cattle were purchased.

Because of improved living standards, farmers have not only changed into new cotton clothes, but also increased the number of plows and tools, preparing to open up wasteland in the spring to expand the area of cultivated land. Taking Xin’ai Village in the Eighth District as an example, almost all of the more than 960 people have put on new cotton clothes, inside and out. The village originally had 70 plows and plans to add 20 more. Farmer Baiyintao Gao originally had three head of cattle and has now doubled that number, and is also preparing to add a plow. In Bairileng Village in the Fourth District, all of the more than 1,400 people have also changed into new cotton clothes. Li Bukui of Jiajialou Village harvested 100 *shi* of grain from cultivating 14 hectares of land last year. After handing over public grain and accounting for miscellaneous expenses, he had more than 60 *shi* of grain left. He decided to use it to buy carts, horses, and farm implements, and plans to open up another three hectares of wasteland this year. The village's more than 180 households have successively purchased eight carts and twenty head of cattle and plan to open up another 30 hectares of wasteland this year, based on their existing production. To increase grain yield, they had already cultivated 50 hectares of autumn-plowed land at the end of last autumn.

Participating in cooperatives and engaging in sideline occupations to increase income has become a mass movement among farmers who have reaped bumper harvests. In Xinmin Village in the Second District, in addition to buying more than 20 carts, 700 shares have been invested in the cooperative by all 240-plus households in the village. For example, Shele's family, with two laborers, harvested more than 50 *shi* of grain, and invested more than 1.4 million *yuan* of their surplus capital in the cooperative. The family of seven not only put on new cotton clothes and trousers, but on average, each person still has more than 50 *chi* of cloth in storage. Sun Qilin, although 61 years old and disabled with a limp, worked hard with his wife to produce 21 *shi* of grain from two hectares of land. To increase soil fertility and yields, he quickly delivered 76 cartloads of manure to the fields after last year's autumn harvest. Currently, they are actively engaged in winter production, weaving more than ten mats and operating a tofu workshop. The elderly couple guarantee a sideline income of 2.5 *shi* of grain. Sun Qilin said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to work hard and produce, I wouldn't be where I am today." Farmers in the Twelfth District have launched a hunting campaign to increase income.

　　内蒙古科左后旗丰收的农民
    添车马穿新衣踊跃参加合作社
    【本报讯】内蒙古自治区科左后旗（属哲里木盟，即科尔沁左翼后旗）全旗丰收的农民，普遍添车买牛，购置农具，为今年大生产作准备工作。
    全旗六百六十多个自然屯，其中一百零四个自然屯共添了一百九十八辆大车，三百五十二条耕牛，六十三头驴，十四匹马，还有骡子等。
    种稻田获得丰收的第五区，大量地添购车马，以准备今年大生产的物质条件。如西舍力屯除种大田外，光种十七垧地稻子，就打了三百石稻子，金小朋五垧地稻子也打了八十石。特格喜白乙拉种一垧三亩地稻子打了二十石粮。他除原有两条牛外，又买了二条大犍牛。该区只五个自然屯总共添了三十一辆大车，单以布敦哈拉根屯一百多户农民，已买进二十辆大车，二十头牛。其他地方普遍添车的如一区十四个自然屯添五十六辆大车。第十区第一村于一九五○年十一月中旬一下子就买了一百零八条牛、四辆大铁车及十辆当地木车。白音套海自然村四十户人家，已买进四十条牛与十辆大车。又如第三区铁布克村买进了十一辆大车，十条大牛。
    农民们因为生活改善，不但都换上了新棉衣，而且拴犁增加工具，准备开春荒，以扩大耕田面积。以第八区新艾里村为例：九百六十多口人几乎都穿上了里外三新的棉衣，全村原有七十付犁，已计划再拴二十付犁。农民白音套高原有三条牛，现又增进了一倍，还准备拴犁。第四区白日楞村全村一千四百多口也都换了新棉衣。贾家楼屯李步奎，去年种十四垧地就打了一百石粮，除交好公粮和零星花消外，剩下六十多石粮，他决定用来购买车马农具，今年准备再开三垧荒。全村一百八十多户陆续买入八辆车，二十条牛，并计划在现有的生产基础上，今年再开三十垧荒。他们为了提高粮食产量，于去年秋末已耕作了五十垧秋翻地。
    参加合作社和搞副业增加收入，已成了丰收农民的群众运动。二区新民村除买二十多辆大车外，全村二百四十多户，往合作社入股的已达七百份，如舍勒的家共两个劳动力打下了五十多石粮，把手里的余资向合作社入股一百四十多万元，全家七口人把新棉衣棉裤都穿上了不算，现所存的布平均每人还够五十多尺。孙起林虽年已六十一岁，残废生瘸子，但和他的妻子努力生产结果，两垧地就打了二十一石粮。他为了增加地力，增加产量，早在去年秋收后很快地送了七十六车粪到地里，目前他们积极地搞冬季生产，编了十多领席子和开豆腐坊，老两口保证副业收入两石五斗粮。孙起林说：“要不是毛主席领导咱努力生产，我早就不会有今天了。”十二区农民却展开了打猎以增加收入。
