　　Dedicated to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Dumu Nuofu
    Glory belongs to the righteous Chinese Volunteer Army, glory belongs to the fearless people, to those advancing on the road to glorious greatness, to the heroes who defend peace with their chests. The beast Truman's bomber squadrons run rampant in China's airspace... This is a conspiracy—a vain attempt to intimidate the Chinese people with bombs, to prevent them from daring to aid their Korean brothers who are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the despicable robbers. --It's nothing, go ahead and aid Korea!
    They are just wasting their efforts! From beside the Kunlun Mountains to the distant coast, the entire Chinese people understand very well: the suffering of Korea is their suffering. The Chinese Volunteer Army bravely advances, marching into the afflicted Korean land. Fighting for a common great cause, without any fear. Courage fills their hearts. Look, here are seasoned warriors, experienced combatants—there are villagers from both sides of the Yangtze River, there are farmers from the fields of Shandong, there are groups of people from Changchun, there are also working masses from Zhangjiakou, and even comrades from various factories in Andong. These simple people rise up to resist, in order to completely crush the American aggressors in Korea; in order to prevent the bandits from daring to show their faces on the Asian coast again; to let the national flag of New China and the flags of Vietnam and Malaya bravely fly high in the sky with their fiery, magnificent red silk. The strength of all nationalities is condensed into steel. There is no strength in the world stronger than this. The ferocity of the Wall Street warmongers will be annihilated in Korea! New warriors, one team after another, sing as they rush to the border. Every warrior goes with a happy feeling to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army. You are heading in the direction of righteousness, the bayonets on your guns shine silver, those are the bayonets that cut down Jiang Jieshi's bandit gang, those are the bayonets that cut down Japanese Bushido. You eagerly await the coming of peace in the motherland, and in the battle for the happy life of all mankind and for the struggle for sacred peace, you will once again establish meritorious service.
    Zhu Ziqi Translated from the Soviet "Literary Gazette" on December 26.
    The author is a poet from the Soviet Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic, and the Russian translator is Verzhinskaya.

### 献给中国人民志愿军

　　献给中国人民志愿军
    杜木诺夫光荣属于正义的中国志愿军，光荣属于大无畏的人们，属于向光辉伟大的路上挺进的人们，属于以自己的胸膛来捍卫和平的英雄。野兽杜鲁门的轰炸机群，在中国的领空横行……这是阴谋诡计——妄想用炸弹来吓倒中国人民，使他们不敢去援助正在与可耻的强盗们进行生死决战的朝鲜弟兄。——算不了什么，援助朝鲜去！
    他们只是白费了心思！从昆仑山旁到远远的海边，整个中国人民都十分了然：朝鲜的苦难——就是他们的苦难。中国志愿军勇猛向前，向受害的朝鲜国土进军。为共同的伟大事业而战，决无恐惧。勇气填膺。你看，这儿有身经百战的勇士，老炼的战斗员——有来自扬子江两岸的老乡，有来自山东田野里的庄稼汉，有来自长春的成群结伴的人们，也有来自张家口的劳动群众，更有来自安东各工厂的同志们，这些纯朴的人们奋起抗战，为的是把美国侵略军彻底粉碎在朝鲜；为的是叫匪徒们不敢再在亚洲的海岸上伸头露面；要让新中国的国旗和越南、马来亚的旗帜，以它那火焰似的壮丽的大红绸在高空中顽强地飘扬。各民族的力量凝成了钢。世上没有比这力量更坚强。华尔街好战分子们的凶焰将在朝鲜被消灭光！新的勇士，一队又一队歌唱着奔向边疆。每一位勇士都怀着幸福的感情去和朝鲜人民军并肩作战。你们奔赴正直的方向，枪上的刺刀闪银光，那是砍倒了蒋介石匪帮的刺刀呵，那是砍倒了日本武士道的刺刀呵。你们热望着祖国的安静来临，在为全人类的幸福生活和为争取神圣的和平的战斗中，又将重新建立功勋。
