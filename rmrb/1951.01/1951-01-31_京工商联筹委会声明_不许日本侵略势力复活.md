　　Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee Statement
　　No Revival of Japanese Aggression Forces
　　[From Our Own Correspondent] The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee issued a statement opposing the U.S. imperialists' rearmament of Japan and the conspiracy for a separate peace, stating: The U.S. imperialists' plot to rearm Japan precisely illustrates their current eagerness for a separate peace treaty with Japan, and is precisely an aggressive plan echoing the rearmament of West Germany. They are clearly attempting to use the people of Japan and Germany as cannon fodder and new tools of aggression. In order to realize its world hegemony plan, it does not hesitate to exclude China and the Soviet Union—the two most important countries at war with Japan—from the contracting parties, and does not hesitate to overturn the 1943 Cairo Declaration, the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement of the same year, which it itself participated in signing. The U.S. government's memoranda to the Soviet government on October 26 and December 28, 1950, are acts of hostility to the people of the world, disrupting the path of peace, and sending the Japanese and German people to their deaths, just as it is doing to itself.
    But can this conspiracy of the U.S. imperialism be effective? The Second World War has already given the Japanese militarists a historical lesson. If the U.S. imperialism wants to use them again as accomplices today, the result will still be failure. Do the Japanese militarists still dream of taking advantage of the support of the U.S. imperialism to try to revive themselves? That is even more of a joke. Today, the U.S. imperialism itself is unable to support itself and is trying to rely on others to act as cannon fodder. Therefore, this conspiracy of the U.S. imperialism, in addition to not being able to save itself from collapse, is also dragging the Japanese people onto a dead end, which is already very obvious.
    The entire capital's industrial and commercial circles are determined to put the patriotic pact into practice, further expand and deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and smash the U.S. imperialists' plot to rearm Japan and conclude a separate peace treaty!

### 京工商联筹委会声明　不许日本侵略势力复活

　　京工商联筹委会声明
　　不许日本侵略势力复活
    【本报讯】北京市工商联筹委会为反对美帝重新武装日本及阴谋片面媾和发表声明称：美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋，正说明了它目前急于片面对日媾和的目的，也正是和武装西德遥相呼应的侵略计划。它显然是企图利用日本和德国的人民去替它充当炮灰，充当新的侵略工具。它为了想实现它的世界霸权计划，就不惜企图把对日作战的最主要的两个国家——中国和苏联——排斥于缔约国之外，就不惜推翻了它自己参加签署的一九四三年开罗宣言，一九四五年的波茨坦公告和同年的雅尔达协定。一九五○年十月二十六日和十二月二十八日美国政府给苏联政府的备忘录，是不惜和全世界人民为敌，破坏了和平轨道，把日本人民和德国人民像它自己一样地送上死路去。
    但是美帝这种阴谋能够收到效果吗？二次世界大战已经给日本军国主义者一个历史性的教训，美帝今天想再利用它来做帮凶，结果仍不过是失败而已。日本军国主义者还梦想假借美帝的扶植企图再死灰复燃吗？那更是个笑话，今天美帝自己就已经不能支持，正想倚靠旁人去替它当炮灰。所以美帝这个阴谋，除了挽救不了它本身的垮台之外，更是把日本人民拖上一条绝路，这已是非常显然的。
    全首都工商界决心实践爱国公约，更加扩大与深入抗美援朝保家卫国运动，粉碎美帝重新武装日本及片面媾和的阴谋！
