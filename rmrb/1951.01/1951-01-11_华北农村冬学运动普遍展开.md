Xinhua News Agency Report: The winter literacy campaign in the five provinces of North China has been widely unfolded in the vast rural areas. Winter schools in various places started successively at the end of November and the beginning of December. According to incomplete statistics, in 35 counties including Baoding and Handan in Hebei Province, more than 3,900 villages have opened winter schools. In Anyang, Hushi, and other four special districts and the Chengguan District of Heze in Pingyuan Province, more than 8,000 winter schools have also opened, with more than 180,000 students enrolled. In villages in the old liberated areas that have year-round people's schools, the year-round people's schools absorb more people to participate in winter learning.

In addition to literacy, anti-US and patriotic education accounts for a large proportion of the learning content of winter schools in North China. Some areas combine current affairs education with literacy education for teaching, such as teaching the students to recognize the eight characters "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, Defend the Country" first, and then explaining their meaning. Winter schools in Pingyuan Province and other places have also conducted denunciations of the crimes of American imperialism. In winter schools in Huailai and other counties in Chahar Province, after teaching new words every day, teachers lectured students on articles such as "A History of American Imperialist Aggression Against China" and "Introducing the Paper Tiger American Imperialism" based on newspapers. Preliminary experience has shown that the masses of farmers generally care about current affairs. All winter schools that pay attention to current affairs education are warmly welcomed by the masses. In villages where current affairs education is well conducted in winter schools, reactionary rumors are shattered, and grain delivery, production and other tasks are carried out smoothly.

In order to enable winter schools to cooperate with the anti-US and patriotic movement and conduct current affairs education for the broad masses of farmers, North China has trained a large number of voluntary teachers in a timely manner. According to statistics from 48 counties and three towns in Hebei Province, more than 8,700 voluntary teachers have been trained. Fifty-seven counties in Shanxi Province have collectively trained more than 16,700 voluntary teachers. District heads and CPC district committee secretaries in Lin County, Anyang and other counties in Pingyuan Province personally led the work of collectively training voluntary teachers. The trained voluntary teachers not only have a clear understanding of the current situation, but also know the methods of running winter schools well, and their confidence has been greatly improved.

In order to strengthen the leadership of winter school work, Linfen and Xing County and other special districts in Shanxi Province and some county towns in Pingyuan Province have organized winter school inspection groups to go to the countryside to inspect and guide the winter school work in various villages, and to conduct timely commendations and criticisms, and exchange work experience. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government has also formulated reward measures for model winter schools, model teachers, and model students. In addition, all localities have established and improved winter school committees at all levels to conduct regular leadership of winter schools.

　　华北农村冬学运动普遍展开
    【本报讯】新华社讯：华北五省的冬学运动已在广大农村中普遍展开。各地冬学都于十一月底、十二月初先后开学。据不完全统计：河北省保定、邯郸等三十五个县，已有三千九百余个村的冬学开学。平原省安阳、湖西等四个专区及菏泽城关区也有八千余所冬学开学，入学者达十八万余人。一般有常年民校的老解放区村庄，则由常年民校吸收更多的群众参加冬季学习。
    华北各地冬学的学习内容，除识字外，抗美爱国主义教育占了很大的比重。有些地区以时事教育与识字教育密切结合来进行教学，如先教学员们识“抗美援朝保家卫国”八个字，然后再讲解它们的意义。平原省等地的冬学更进行了对美帝国主义罪行的控诉。察哈尔省怀来等县的冬学，每天教完生字后，教员即根据报纸给学员们讲授“美帝国主义侵华史”、“介绍纸老虎美帝国主义”等文章。据已有的初步经验表明，农民群众普遍关心时事。凡是注意进行了时事教育的冬学，都受到群众的热烈欢迎。在冬学中时事教育进行得好的村庄，反动谣言被粉碎，交粮、生产等工作也顺利地开展。
    为了使冬学能够配合抗美爱国运动，向广大农民进行时事教育，华北各地及时地训练了大批义务教员。据河北省四十八个县和三个镇的统计，受训练的义务教员达八千七百余人。山西省五十七个县共集训义务教员一万六千七百余人。平原省林县、安阳等县各区区长、中共区委书记等，都亲自领导集训义务教员的工作。受过训练的义务教员，不仅对目前形势有了清楚的认识，并知道了办好冬学的方法，信心大为提高。
    为了加强对冬学工作的领导，山西省临汾、兴县等专区及平原省部分县城都组织了冬学视导组，下乡视察和指导各村冬学工作，及时进行表扬和批评，交流工作经验。山西省人民政府并制定了对模范冬学、模范教员和模范学员的奖励办法。此外，各地都建立与健全了各级冬学委员会，以进行对冬学的经常领导工作。
