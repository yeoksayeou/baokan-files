　　Xinhua News Agency Frontline Dispatch from Korea

　　　　Paving the Road to Victory in the Snowy Mountains

　　Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers, overcoming the difficulties of severe cold and braving wind and snow, are opening up countless roads in the sparsely populated snowy mountains of northern Korea to pursue the enemy and transport supplies. The soldiers of the guard battalion of a certain unit, using simple tools, opened up a road on Guangcheng Ridge, which is 1,726 meters above sea level.

　　Guangcheng Ridge originally had a rugged and steep path that stretched for forty *li* up and down the mountain, but it had long been covered by snow. Ancient trees, withered and dead for many years, were scattered in all directions, and ice and snow blocked the entire mountain range. Normally, no one would want to cross this mountain. But now, the personnel, ammunition, and food of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army...all need to cross this mountain range and head south to eliminate the American invading army. This requires opening up a road in this snowy mountain.

　　The guard battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army resolutely took on the task of being the vanguard for opening the road. Commanders and fighters formed day and night shifts, using shovels and pickaxes, simple tools, to excavate ice and snow, and then dig out soil from under the ice and snow. Sometimes, when encountering mountain streams, they felled trees to build bridges. As they approached the summit, the difficulties increased. At steep places, they had to climb trees and grab branches to work, and the slightest carelessness could cause them to roll down into the deep valley. At the top of the mountain, fierce winds mixed with snowflakes, and the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius attacked every soldier, but they did not stop working. They encouraged each other: "In order to quickly pursue and annihilate the enemy, we must resolutely and quickly complete the road-opening task." After five days and nights of arduous struggle, a new road was finally opened up on the desolate and barren ridge covered in white. The first soldiers to reach the summit deeply carved several large characters on the snow: "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has arrived."

　　After the road was completed, the powerful troops of the People's Volunteer Army quickly advanced along this road. The transport torrent composed of countless people also used this road to transport huge quantities of supplies to the front. As the Volunteer Army soldiers stepped on the road they had opened, they saw groups of disheveled American prisoners being escorted to the rear, and every soldier felt extremely excited. In the wind and snow, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army accelerated their pace and marched forward with enthusiasm.

　　　　Two Communist Party Members Sacrificing Themselves to Destroy Enemy Bunkers

　　When the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the Northeast Korean front launched a powerful offensive against the US military on the entire line from Hamhung to Yudam-ni, a certain unit of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, tasked with blocking enemy reinforcements, launched an attack on S 창리 west of Hamhung and Yudam-ni. When they reached the small hill west of the street in S 창리, the enemy, relying on superior firepower and favorable terrain, stubbornly resisted from two bunkers on Height 791. The first platoon, which was serving as the vanguard, attacked several times without taking down the bunkers. The explosives and grenades thrown at the bunkers slid down the slope and could not harm the enemy. At this time, Wu Zaiqing, the leader of the second platoon and a member of the Communist Party, stepped forward and said to the company commander: "Company commander, assign me the task of blowing up the bunkers. To aid the Korean people and defend our motherland, sacrifice is worth it." Jiang Delin, the leader of the fifth platoon and another member of the Communist Party, also said: "Please, company commander, assign me the task of blasting the enemy's bunkers. I guarantee I can complete the task." Each of them took a pack of explosives and rushed towards the two bunkers. As they approached the bunkers, they were discovered by the enemy. The two heroes immediately hugged the explosives and rushed towards the bunkers. In two loud explosions and two bursts of fire, these two excellent members of the Chinese Communist Party, loyal sons of the Chinese people, gloriously sacrificed themselves. The American invading troops in the two bunkers were also blown to pieces. The remaining American troops on the mountain, after this sudden blow, fled in panic. Our follow-up troops immediately advanced bravely along the road to victory that the two heroic martyrs had sacrificed their lives to blast open, pursuing and annihilating the remaining enemy. The commanders and fighters unanimously swore: "Completely and thoroughly eliminate the American invading army and avenge our heroic comrades who sacrificed themselves!"

　　　　Guo Zongqing Bravely Blows Up a Tank

　　The soldiers of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army are creating heroic deeds that frighten the American invading army every moment. Guo Zongqing, a soldier of the third squad of a certain unit and a member of the Communist Party, blew up an enemy tank with explosives, which is just one of thousands of heroic examples. Before the battle began, Guo Zongqing vowed to strive to send the first pack of explosives to the American invading army to taste. On the evening of November 27, the troops prepared to launch an attack. The deputy battalion commander deployed two demolition teams to go to the road to blow up the tanks, and Guo Zongqing joined one of the teams. Guo Zongqing and two partners ran along the gully towards the road, and when they got close to the road, they crawled. Piles of enemies were roasting fire on the road, and there was a tank on the road. They crawled three or four steps, and the enemy found them and fired a burst of guns. Guo Zongqing and his partners continued to crawl silently towards the road. When they were only about one meter away from the tank, they deftly pulled the fuse, turned over, and stuffed two packs of explosives into the tracks of the tank, and then quickly crawled back. When they were about fifteen meters away from the tank, there was a loud bang, and an enemy tank was shrouded in smoke and fire. Guo Zongqing and his partners flew away from the enemy's fire net and returned to the team victoriously. The next day, the enemies on the road had all fled, and there lay a tank that could not move.

            在雪山中开辟胜利的道路
    我国人民志愿军的战士们，克服了严寒的困难，冒着风雪，在朝鲜北部罕有人迹的雪山中，开辟着无数条追击敌人和运输物资的道路。某部警卫营的战士们以简单的工具，在拔海一千七百二十六公尺的广城岭上，开辟出来的道路就是其中的一条。
    广城岭本来有一条上下四十里的崎岖陡削的小道，可是早就为积雪所掩盖，年久枯死的古树纵横杂陈，冰雪封锁了整个的山岭。平时自然是没有人要翻过这座山的。可是现在我国志愿军的人马、弹药、粮食……都需要越过这座山岭，奔向南方去消灭美国侵略军，这就需要在这座雪山中开辟出一条道路。
    中国人民志愿军某部的警卫营，毅然担负起了开路先锋的任务。指战员们组成日、夜班，用洋锹、十字镐这样简单工具开凿冰雪，再从冰雪底下挖出泥土。有时遇着山涧溪流，他们就伐木架桥。当接近山巅时，困难愈多了，陡削之处必须爬树攀枝上去动工，稍一不慎就会滚下深谷。在高山顶，狂风夹着雪花，零下三十度的严寒袭击着每一个战士，但他们没有停止工作，他们相互鼓励着：“为了迅速追歼敌人，我们要坚决迅速地完成开路任务。”经过了五昼夜的艰苦搏斗，白茫茫的一片荒凉的峻岭上，终于开辟出来一条新的道路。首先到达山顶的战士，在雪地上深深地划了几个大字：“中国人民志愿军到此。”
    路修成后，人民志愿军的强大部队迅速地通过这条路向前挺进。由无数的人群所组成的运输洪流，也通过这条路将巨量的物资运到前方。志愿军的战士们踏着自己开的路，迎面看到的是一群一群押送到后方去的狼狈不堪的美国俘虏，每个战士心中更是兴奋万分。在风雪中，中国人民志愿军的战士们加速步伐，昂奋前进。
            舍身炸毁敌地堡的两位中共党员
    当朝鲜东北前线的中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军在咸兴至柳潭里全线对美军发动强大攻势之际，担任阻击敌人援军的任务的我国人民志愿军某部，对咸兴、柳潭里以西的社仓里发起了攻击。当他们在进抵社仓里西临街小山时，敌人凭借优势火力和有利地形，在七九一高地上据守两个地堡顽抗。担任前卫的一班攻击了几次都没有将地堡夺下来。投向地堡的炸药及手榴弹都顺坡滑落山下，不能杀伤敌人。这时中共党员第二班班长吴再清挺身而出，向连长说：“连长，把爆炸地堡的任务交给我好了，为了援助朝鲜人民，保卫自己的祖国，牺牲也值得。”另一个中共党员五班长蒋德林也说：“请连长把爆破敌人地堡的任务交给我，保证能完成任务。”两人各带一包炸药，冲向两个地堡。他们在接近地堡时，被敌人发觉了。两位英雄立即抱着炸药，迅速地向地堡猛扑过去。在两声巨响，两团火光中，这两位优秀的中国共产党党员、中国人民忠实的儿子，是光荣地牺牲了；两个地堡中的美国侵略军亦被炸成粉碎。山上其余的美军经这突然一击，仓惶溃逃。我后续部队立即沿着两位英雄烈士舍身炸出来的胜利道路，奋勇前进，追歼残敌。指战员们一致宣誓：“干净彻底地消灭美国侵略军，为英勇牺牲的战友复仇！”

            郭宗庆奋勇炸坦克
    我国人民志愿军的战士们每时每刻都在创造着使美国侵略军心惊胆寒的英勇事迹。某部三班战士共产党员郭宗庆抱炸药炸毁敌人坦克，就是千百件英勇战例中的一件。在战斗开始前，郭宗庆就发誓要争取送第一包炸药给美国侵略军尝尝。十一月二十七日晚上，部队准备发起攻击。副营长布置了两个爆炸组插到公路上去炸坦克，郭宗庆便参加了其中一个组。郭宗庆和两个伙伴沿着山沟向公路奔去，跑近公路时，便匍匐着爬去。一堆堆敌人正在公路上烤火，路上还摆着一辆坦克。他们爬了三、四步敌人发觉了，就乱打了一阵枪。郭宗庆和他的伙伴不声不响地继续向公路爬行。在离开坦克只有一公尺左右时，他们便敏捷地拉开导火索，一翻身把两包炸药塞进坦克的履带中，然后迅速地爬回来。在他们离开坦克约十五公尺时，轰然一声，一辆敌人的坦克笼罩在烟火中。郭宗庆和他的伙伴飞也似地离开了敌人的火网，胜利地回到队伍里。第二天，公路上的敌人都逃走了，那里躺着一辆不能动弹的坦克。
