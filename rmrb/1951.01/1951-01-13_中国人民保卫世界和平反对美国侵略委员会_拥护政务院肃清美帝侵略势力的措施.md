Xinhua News Agency, January 11th - The China Peace Committee Against American Aggression issued a statement supporting the Central People's Government Administration Council's decision regarding the policy of controlling American property and handling cultural, educational, and other organizations and groups receiving American subsidies. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On December 28th of last year, the Central People's Government Administration Council issued orders to control and investigate all properties of the American government and American enterprises within our country, and to freeze all American public and private deposits in all banks within our country. On the 29th, it issued a decision regarding the policy of handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations, as well as religious groups, receiving American subsidies. These wise and correct measures not only provide an effective counterattack against the American imperialism that is currently hostile to the Chinese people, but also have epoch-making significance for the economic and cultural lives of the Chinese people. Without a doubt, this is entirely in accordance with the will of the Chinese people.

Recently, as the American imperialists face defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, they brazenly announced the control of public and private property of the People's Republic of China within American jurisdictions and prohibited all ships registered in the United States from sailing to Chinese ports, attempting to further plunder the property of the Chinese people economically. At the same time, they threatened the lives of personnel in all religious, cultural, and relief groups receiving American subsidies. This is a new crime by American imperialism, following its armed aggression against our Taiwan, bombing of our Northeast and Shandong, and shelling of our merchant ships, that infringes upon the interests of the Chinese people, and is intolerable to the Chinese people. Controlling and investigating American property within our borders, freezing American public and private deposits, and appropriately handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups receiving American subsidies are necessary steps to respond to the crimes of American imperialism. We firmly support these measures promulgated by the Government Administration Council. We must continue to expand and deepen the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and call on people from all sectors of industry, commerce, culture, education, and relief nationwide to uphold the spirit of patriotism and, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, strive to implement these measures in order to completely eliminate the American imperialist influence on Chinese culture and economy.

　　中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    拥护政务院肃清美帝侵略势力的措施
    【新华社十一日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会发表声明拥护中央人民政府政务院关于管制美国财产、处理接受美国津贴的文化教育等机关团体的方针的决定。声明全文如下：
    中央人民政府政务院于去年十二月二十八日发布了关于管制和清查我国境内之美国政府和美国企业的一切财产，冻结我国境内所有银行的一切美国公私存款的命令，二十九日又发布了关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定。这些英明正确的措施不仅给予了当前与中国人民为敌的美帝国主义以有效的回击，而且在中国人民的经济生活和文化生活上也有着划时代的意义。毫无疑问，这是完全符合中国人民的意志的。
    美国帝国主义最近在侵朝战争失败之际，悍然宣布管制我中华人民共和国在美国辖区内的公私财产并禁止一切在美注册的船只开到中国港口，妄图在经济上进一步掠夺中国人民的财产，同时威胁所有接受美国津贴的宗教、文化、救济团体中的人员的生活。这是美国帝国主义继其武装侵略我台湾、轰炸我东北、山东，炮击我商船之后，侵害我国人民利益的新的罪行，是中国人民所不能容忍的。管制清查我国境内的美国财产，冻结美国公私存款，并对接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体予以适当的处理，正是回答美国帝国主义罪行的必要的步骤。我们坚决拥护政务院所颁布的这些措施。我们要继续扩大和深入抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并号召全国工商界、文化界、教育界、救济界人士，本爱国精神，在中央人民政府领导之下，为贯彻这些措施，以完全肃清美帝国主义在中国文化上、经济上的侵略影响而奋斗。
