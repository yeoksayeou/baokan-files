Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 11th -- The Preparatory Committee of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce wrote to Chairman Mao on January 8th, reporting on the situation of organizing industrialists and businessmen to study in 1950. The full text is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

We, the industrialists and businessmen of Chongqing, have victoriously passed through the historically significant year of 1950 and are welcoming the arrival of 1951 with boundless joy. In these days of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, and preparing to greet even greater victories, we cannot help but sincerely thank you: The tremendous victories in economic construction achieved under your wise leadership over the past year have enabled industry and commerce in Chongqing, and even the whole country, to recover and develop to varying degrees. Here, we will give you a brief report on the situation of organizing industrialists and businessmen to study over the past year, expressing that under your education, we have obtained preliminary ideological transformation, thereby promoting the improvement of industry and commerce.

The industrialists and businessmen of Chongqing grew up under the long-term rule of feudal forces, bureaucrats, and compradors. Before liberation, they rarely received the edification of new ideas and were deeply poisoned by the malicious propaganda of the reactionaries. Although they were fortunate to have escaped the shackles of the reactionaries after liberation, they still harbored doubts and concerns about the policies of the People's Government. However, driven by the national study wave, industrialists and businessmen generally began to feel the need to study the Common Program and policies and laws in their business operations. Therefore, after the establishment of the Federation of Industry and Commerce at the end of April last year, study groups for various industries were gradually established with a focus on a voluntary basis. By the end of the year, 103 study groups had been established in 56 industries, with more than 3,000 industrialists and businessmen regularly participating in the study. On November 1st, a political research class for industry and commerce was also established to become the backbone of the study movement in each group. In addition to group study, industrial and commercial study meetings were held regularly once a week, inviting leading Party and government officials and experts to speak. Twenty-five such meetings were held, with a cumulative audience of more than 25,000 people.

Respected Chairman Mao! We should report to you: After this period of study, the industrialists and businessmen of Chongqing have made great progress in their ideological understanding, thereby enabling production and business to achieve certain progress. The first is the gradual normalization of labor-capital relations and public-private relations; labor-capital disputes can be resolved under the leadership of the People's Government in accordance with the principles of democracy, equality, and mutual benefit; a total of 93 labor-capital consultation meetings have been established for the whole industry, regional and production units; some industrialists and businessmen have gradually overcome the past idea of simply relying on the government's care in public-private relations; some enterprises have also carried out transformation under the guidance of the government and the joint efforts of labor and capital, and have made partial achievements in reducing costs and improving quality (of course, it is still far from enough), such as the cotton textile industry, most of which have reached or are close to achieving a balance of income and expenditure. In the enterprise reform, many industries have implemented joint operations. As of the end of December, 72 joint operation organizations have been established in the city, including 26 industries, 1,423 factories, shops, and workshops. In addition, the blindness in industrial production and the speculation in commercial operations have been significantly reduced. After we studied the eight directives of the Central Ministry of Trade on banning speculative commerce, our progressive industrialists and businessmen have been fighting against speculators to stabilize prices and protect the interests of legitimate industry and commerce.

Since American imperialism launched its aggression against Korea and Taiwan, study groups in various industries have conducted long-term current affairs studies and held current affairs seminars in 116 industries. After the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country was launched nationwide, we held seminars in 56 key industries one after another. Some national industries that had suffered from American imperialism's economic aggression made accusations at the seminars; some industrialists and businessmen's reactionary ideas of admiring America and being pro-American, and their erroneous ideas of fearing America, were initially clarified at the seminars. In the grand parade held by the industrial and commercial circles to celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang, the number of participants reached more than 40,000, and the grand occasion was truly unprecedented. Now, various industries are launching a patriotic covenant signing campaign to guarantee that the city's industrialists and businessmen will resolutely fight against American imperialism. There are two more things worth reporting to you: one is that Chongqing's industrial and commercial tax for 1950 was successfully completed on New Year's Eve, which is a concrete manifestation of the industrialists and businessmen's implementation of the patriotic covenant; the other is that Chongqing's industrialists and businessmen, who have a strong feudal character, are currently rushing to complete the procedures for rent reduction and deposit refunds. Because of sufficient ideological preparation in advance, everyone is quite determined to sever the feudal tail.

We assure you that in 1951, we will, on the basis of the existing study groups, in coordination with the general reorganization of the various trade associations, promote it to all industries in an organized and planned manner, listing study work as one of the central tasks of each trade association, combining theoretical study with business transformation, and striving for further improvement in industry and commerce to enhance our economic strength. In current affairs study, we will more broadly and deeply carry out the anti-American patriotic movement and establish a patriotic viewpoint. Resolutely consolidate the united front against imperialism and feudalism.

With highest respect,
The Preparatory Committee of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce
January 8th

　　重庆工商界写信报告毛主席
    去年思想初步改造从而推动业务好转
    今年要更推进学习建立爱国主义观点
    【新华社重庆十一日电】重庆市工商业联合会筹备委员会于一月八日上书毛主席，报告一九五零年组织工商业者学习的情况。全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们重庆的工商业者，胜利度过了富有历史意义的一九五零年，带着无限的欢欣，迎接着一九五一年的到来。在这除旧布新准备迎接更大胜利的时日，我们不由得不衷心感谢您：一年来，由于您的英明领导所获致的经济建设上的巨大胜利，使我们重庆乃至全国工商业，都已在不同的程度上得到了恢复和发展。这里，我们把过去一年来组织工商业者学习的情况，向您作一个简略的报告，表示我们在您的教育下，获得了思想上的初步改造，从而推动了工商业的好转。
    重庆的工商业者，是在封建势力、官僚、买办的长期统治下生长起来的，解放前很少受过新思想的薰陶，所受反动派恶意宣传的毒素很深。解放后虽然庆幸着自己摆脱了反动的枷锁，但是对于人民政府的政策还是存在怀疑和顾虑。但在全国学习的浪潮的带动下，一般工商业者从业务经营上也开始感到有学习共同纲领及政策法令的需要，于是，在去年四月底工商联成立以后，即在自觉自愿的原则下，有重点地逐步建立了各行业的学习小组。到年底为止，已在五十六个行业中，建立了一百零三个学习小组，经常参加学习的工商业者在三千人以上。十一月一日又创办了工商业政治研究班，使其成为各组学习运动中的骨干。除小组学习外，每周还定期举行一次工商学习会，邀请党政首长及专家讲话，前后举行了二十五次，累计听众达二万五千余人。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们应该向您报告：经过这一段时间的学习后，我们重庆的工商业者，在思想认识上已获得了很大的进步，从而使生产和业务也获得一定的进展。首先是劳资关系、公私关系的逐渐正常；劳资争议的案件都能在人民政府领导下，本民主、平等、两利的原则求得解决；全业性的、地区性的及生产单位的，一共已建立了九十三个劳资协商会议；一部分工商业者并逐渐克服了过去在公私关系上单纯倚赖政府照顾的思想；部分企业并且还在政府指导及劳资双方共同努力下进行了改造，在降低成本、提高品质各方面做出了部分成绩（当然还很不够），如棉纺织业大部分已达到收支平衡或接近平衡。在企业改革中，不少行业实行了联营，截至十二月底止，全市已成立七十二个联营组织，包括二十六个行业，一千四百二十三家厂店作坊。此外，工业生产上的盲目性和商业经营上的投机性都显著减少了。在我们学习中央贸易部取缔投机商业的八项指示后，我们进步的工商业者一直在与投机分子作斗争，为稳定物价和保护正当工商业的利益而奋斗。
    自从美帝国主义发动对朝鲜、台湾的侵略后，各业学习小组进行了长期时事学习，曾在一百一十六个行业中举行了时事座谈会。抗美援朝保家卫国运动在全国展开后，我们先后在五十六个重点行业中举行了座谈会，一部分曾经遭受美帝国主义经济侵略的民族工业，在座谈会上作了控诉；一部分工商业者崇美、亲美的反动思想和恐美的错误思想，在座谈会上得到了初步的澄清。在工商界举行的庆祝平壤解放的大游行中，参加人数达四万余人，盛况委实是空前的。现在，各业正展开爱国公约的签名运动，作为全市工商业者与美帝国主义作坚决斗争的保证。还有两件事值得向您报告：一件是重庆一九五零年的工商业税，已经在除夕那天胜利完成了，这是工商业者执行爱国公约的具体表现；一件是带有浓厚封建性的重庆工商业者，目前正在赶办减租退押手续，由于事先有了充分的思想准备，大家对于割断封建尾巴，颇具决心。
    我们向您保证：在一九五一年，我们将在现有学习组的基础上，配合各同业公会的普遍整理，有组织有计划地推动到所有行业，把学习工作列为各公会的中心任务之一，把理论学习与业务改造相结合，争取工商业进一步的好转，以增强我们的经济力量。在时事学习上，我们更要广泛而深入地开展抗美爱国运动，建立爱国主义的观点。坚决巩固反对帝国主义、封建主义的统一战线。
          谨致崇高的敬礼
    重庆市工商业联合会筹备委员会  一月八日
