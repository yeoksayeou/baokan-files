I Saw Chairman Mao
Worker at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Cao Xianbo

On August 23rd last year, the Romanian Embassy in Beijing held a celebration banquet for the 6th anniversary of Romania's liberation, and I was unexpectedly invited to attend. When the factory gave me the invitation, my heart started pounding. I thought: What kind of scene would such an international banquet be? What if someone asked me to say a few words in front of everyone? I'd definitely make a fool of myself on the spot. But then I thought: Chairman Mao might attend the meeting! I've wanted to see Chairman Mao for so long, I can't miss this opportunity. So, I decided to bite the bullet and go. At seven o'clock in the afternoon, the factory sent a car to take me there. On the way, I kept thinking: We workers have been liberated, riding in a car to attend an international banquet. I couldn't even dream of this before! But today, it's absolutely true. I bit my finger, and it felt a little painful. Yes! It really was me sitting in the car, not a dream. I was smiling so hard inside that I thought I would burst, but my eyes were a little hot.

When I entered the auditorium of the Beijing Hotel, I saw a sea of people and didn't know where to sit. The comrade serving as a host probably saw my hesitation, pointed me to a seat, and I sat down. My eyes were fixed on the door, afraid that Chairman Mao would come in and I wouldn't see him. Around eight o'clock, there was a burst of military music outside the door, and everyone stood up. My heart was pounding. When I saw Chairman Mao appear at the door, I jumped and applauded, softly shouting, "Chairman Mao is here! Chairman Mao is here!" If anyone had noticed my appearance at the time, they would have thought I was crazy. Chairman Mao sat down, and I sat down too. I turned my chair around to face Chairman Mao's seat. I didn't see any of the dishes on the table. I only saw that Chairman Mao's hair was black, his face had no wrinkles, and he was in very good spirits. My tears rolled down all at once. This is truly the blessing of all the people of our country! I thought that when I go back, if anyone asks me, "What did you see at the meeting?" my first sentence will definitely be, "Chairman Mao is very healthy!" Chairman Mao also spoke at the meeting. He said: Six years ago, we were also oppressed by fascist bandits. Today, the facts have proven that the power of the people is irresistible. If it weren't for Chairman Mao's wise leadership, who knows how many detours our revolution would have taken? At the meeting, many ambassadors from the new democratic countries spoke. Although their languages were different, their words were inseparable from the word "people." It can be seen that the proletarian parties all over the world love the working people in the same way. After dinner, a movie was shown. Comrade Stalin appeared on the screen, smiling and stroking the heads of children presenting flowers. He smiled so naturally and kindly. I couldn't help but turn my head and look in the direction where Chairman Mao was sitting. I felt that Chairman Mao was working so hard also for our next generation! All the way back after the meeting, Chairman Mao's image was in my mind. The car stopped, and I saw our factory again. After getting out of the car, the first person I saw was Comrade Jiang Enhua, our Party branch secretary. I shook his hand tightly and said, "I saw Chairman Mao!"

　　我看见了毛主席
    石景山钢铁厂工人  曹宪波
    去年八月二十三日，北京罗马尼亚大使馆举行庆祝罗马尼亚解放六周年纪念宴会，我意外地被邀请参加了。当厂方把请帖交给我的时候，我心里直扑腾。我想：这么一个国际间的宴会，能是个什么场面？要是有人叫我当着大伙儿说两句话，怎么办？准得当场出丑。可又一想：毛主席可能参加会呀！多久就想看看毛主席，这可不能错过机会。这么着，我就决心硬着头皮去。下午七点钟，厂子里开了一部汽车把我送去了，一路上我心里都在捉摸：我们工人是翻身了，坐着大汽车，去参加国际间的宴会。在早先做梦也做不到呀！可在今天，这是千真万确的事情，我咬咬手指头，觉得有点痛。不错！坐在汽车里的，的确是我，不是梦，我心里笑的要裂开了，眼睛里却有点热乎乎的。
    进了北京饭店的礼堂，看见黑压压的一片人，不知道该坐在那里才对，招待员同志大概看出了我的踌躇，他指给我一个位子，我便坐下来。我的眼睛一直盯着大门，生怕毛主席进来了，我没看见。到了八点钟的样子，门外一阵军乐声，大家都站起来了，我心里噗噗地跳。当我发现毛主席出现在大门口的时候，我一面跳，一面鼓掌，嘴里轻轻地喊着：“毛主席来了！毛主席来了！”我想要是有人注意一下我当时的样子，会以为我的神经有毛病。毛主席坐下了，我也坐下了。我把椅子换了个方向，面对着毛主席的座位。桌子上摆的什么菜。我全没看见。我只看见毛主席的头发黑黑的，脸上没有一丝皱纹，精神很好。我的热泪一下子滚下来了，这真是我们全国人民的福气呀！我想回去以后，谁要是问我：“会场里都看到些什么？”我第一句话一定告诉他：“毛主席很健康！”会上毛主席也讲了话，他说：六年前，我们也一样地受着法西斯强盗的压迫，今天事实证明了，人民的力量是不可抵抗的。——要是没有毛主席英明的领导，我们的革命还不知道要走多少弯路呢？在会上，许多新民主主义国家的大使都讲了话，他们的语言虽不同，可是他们的话里都离不开“人民”两个字，可见全世界的无产阶级政党，同样的爱着劳动人民。饭后放映电影，银幕上出现了斯大林同志，他笑着，抚摸着献花儿童的脑袋。他笑的那么自然，亲切。我不由转过头去，看着毛主席坐的方向，我觉得毛主席所以这样辛苦，也是为了我们下一代呀！一直到散会回来，一路上，我脑海里都显现着毛主席的影子。车子停下来了，我重新看到我们的工厂。下车以后，第一个看见的，是我们的党总支书记蒋恩化同志，我紧紧握着他的手说：“我看见了毛主席！”
