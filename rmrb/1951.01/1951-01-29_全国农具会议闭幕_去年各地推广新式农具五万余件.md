Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The first national agricultural implement conference in Chinese history concluded today. The conference lasted nine days. The main purpose of this conference, convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, was to summarize the national agricultural implement work in 1950, to discuss and determine the guiding principles and tasks of the national agricultural implement work in 1951, and the specific methods to complete the above tasks. More than 50 representatives from the agricultural and forestry departments of major administrative regions, the agricultural and forestry bureaus and agricultural implement stations of provinces with agricultural implement stations, experts, professors, engineers, and the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government attended the conference.

The conference pointed out that thanks to the correct leadership of governments at all levels and the concerted efforts of agricultural implement workers across the country, the national agricultural implement work achieved good results in 1950. Last year, more than 50,000 new agricultural implements were promoted nationwide; agricultural implement loans totaling more than 10 million jin of grain were issued in North China, Northwest China, East China, and Central South China, which played a certain role in helping farmers in various regions supplement their agricultural implements. For example, more than 1.9 million various agricultural implements were supplemented in North China last year. Forty-seven agricultural implement stations were also established in Northwest China, North China, and other regions, and each station vigorously carried out the demonstration and promotion of new agricultural implements. In the areas where new agricultural implements were promoted, the labor efficiency of farmers was greatly improved. For example, the efficiency of new agricultural implements in Northeast China was three to five times higher than that of farmers' original agricultural implements. Therefore, a lot of labor was saved for other production, so that new agricultural implements generally gained a good impression among farmers.

The conference further pointed out that although the national promotion of new agricultural implements achieved the above-mentioned results last year, it is still far from meeting the needs of farmers. At present, the lack of agricultural implements in the vast rural areas is very serious. According to a survey of 49 typical villages in 16 counties in Shandong Province, 14 percent of farmers lack plows. In addition, due to the limitations of China's current industrial conditions and farmers' technical conditions, new agricultural implements cannot be mass-produced and promoted nationwide. Therefore, various regions should supplement and repair the original agricultural implements of farmers in large quantities to meet the needs of farmers. This is the main task of the national agricultural implement work this year.

Based on the above situation, the conference determined that the guiding principle of the national agricultural implement work this year is: to focus on restoring, supplementing, and repairing farmers' original agricultural implements, and to carry out demonstration and promotion of new agricultural implements in a focused manner. In terms of supplementing farmers' original agricultural implements, the conference stipulated that approximately 1 million pieces of farmers' original agricultural implements should be supplemented nationwide this year. The types of supplements mainly include agricultural implements such as plowshares, plow wings, harrows, hoes, and adzes. The areas for supplementation should focus on areas with inconvenient transportation, lack of agricultural implements, and areas that suffered disasters last year. In order to complete the task of supplementing agricultural implements, the conference believes that various regions must take the county as a unit, and organize blacksmith shops and carpentry shops through local cooperatives and trading companies to vigorously manufacture and repair agricultural implements.

In terms of promoting new agricultural implements, the conference determined that various regions must carry out work in a focused and steady manner in order to accumulate experience and gradually promote them. The conference decided to focus on promoting the new type of plow that has been successfully trial-produced last year and is currently the most urgently needed by farmers. This new type of plow has a simple structure, relatively low price, and is easy to promote. The areas for promotion are mainly areas with convenient transportation, areas with special products, and areas lacking agricultural implements.

In terms of agricultural implement manufacturing, the conference pointed out that the guiding principle for 1951 is not to build new factories, not to expand old factories, strengthen cost accounting, improve quality, and implement the principle of consolidating existing achievements. In order to reduce costs and freight, the method of taking materials locally, manufacturing locally, and promoting locally will be adopted in the future to lay the foundation for promoting agricultural implements. The conference emphasized that the promotion work of agricultural implement stations should gradually be transformed into enterprise-based operations. Each station should actively and systematically carry out business, reward cash purchases of agricultural implements, and shorten the loan period to accelerate the turnover of funds.

　　全国农具会议闭幕
    去年各地推广新式农具五万余件
    【新华社二十七日讯】中国历史上第一次全国性的农具会议已于今日闭幕。会议历时九天。中央人民政府农业部召开这次会议的主要目的，是总结一九五○年全国农具工作，讨论和确定一九五一年全国农具工作的方针和任务，以及完成上述任务的具体办法。参加这次会议的有各大行政区农林部，各设有农具站的省农林厅、农具站，各地专家、教授、工程师以及中央人民政府政务院，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会等代表五十余人。
    会议指出，由于各级人民政府的正确领导，和各地从事农具工作者的一致努力，一九五○年全国农具工作获得良好的成绩。去年全国各地共推广新式农具达五万余件；华北、西北、华东、中南等区并发放农具贷粮共一千余万斤，这些贷粮在帮助各地农民增补农具上都起了一定的作用。如华北地区去年增补的各种农具即达一百九十余万件。西北、华北等区并建立四十七个农具站，各站大力进行了新式农具的示范和推广工作。在推广新式农具的地区，大大提高了农民的劳动效率，如东北地区新式农具的效能即比农民原有农具提高三倍至五倍。因而节省了许多劳动力从事其他生产，使新式农具在农民中普遍获得良好的印象。
    会议继指出，去年全国推广新式农具工作虽然获得上述成绩，但是距离农民的需要还很远。在目前，广大农村中缺乏农具的情况是非常严重的。根据山东省十六个县四十九个典型村的调查，农民缺乏犁达百分之十四。加以目前中国的工业条件和农民的技术条件等的限制，新式农具在全国还不能大量制造和推广。因此各地应大量补充和修理农民中的原有农具，以供农民的需要。这是今年全国农具工作的主要任务。
    会议根据上述情况，确定了今年全国农具工作的方针为：以恢复、补充和修理农民原有农具为主，并有重点地进行示范和推广新式农具。在增补农民原有农具方面，会议规定，今年全国要增补农民原有农具约一百余万件。增补的种类，主要是犁铧、犁壁、耙、锄、镢等农具。增补的地区着重在交通不方便和缺乏农具以及去年遭灾的地区。为了完成增补农具任务，会议认为各地必须以县为单位，通过当地合作社、贸易公司组织铁匠炉、木匠铺大力制造和修理农具。
    在推广新农具方面，会议确定各地必须有重点地稳步地进行工作，以便积累经验，逐步推广。会议确定着重推广去年已试制成功的而且是目前农民最迫切需要的新式犁。这种新式犁，构造简单，价格比较低廉，便于推广。推广地区，主要是交通方便、特产地区和农具缺乏的地区。
    在农具制造方面，会议指出，一九五一年的方针是不建新厂，不扩大旧厂，加强成本核算，提高质量，贯彻巩固现有成果的方针。为了减低成本和运费，今后采取就地取材、就地制造、就地推广的办法，以打下推广农具的基础。会议强调提出农具站的推广工作要逐渐转为企业化的经营。各站应主动地有计划地开展业务，奖励现款购买农具，并缩短出贷期，以加速资金的流转。
