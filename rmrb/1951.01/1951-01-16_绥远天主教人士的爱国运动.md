　　The patriotic movement of Catholics in Suiyuan

　　The 120,000 Catholics in Suiyuan Province have begun to participate in the righteous action of the Chinese people to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.
　　Following the Christian community of the province's expression of support for the reform movement, more than 640 Chinese Catholics in Guisui City, Suiyuan Province, convened a forum on December 9, 1950. At the meeting, many Catholic priests, principals and teachers of Catholic-run middle and primary schools, as well as Catholic citizens and peasant Catholics, spoke. They unanimously expressed their determination to sever all ties with imperialism, implement self-governance, self-propagation, and self-support, and to widely launch a movement among Catholics to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and to unite with the people of the whole country to smash the aggression of American imperialism. Priest Hu Ruhan believed that to love the church is to love the country. He said: "In the era when the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled China, imperialists could run amok in China, and the humiliation suffered by the Chinese people from imperialism is unbearable to recall. Now, in order to defend our motherland, we must rise up to oppose imperialist aggression." Zhao Denglian, a Catholic engaged in education, said: "No matter where the Catholics are, whoever opposes imperialism is our friend. Catholics engaged in various undertakings should rise up to resist America and aid Korea, because now that our motherland has been invaded by the enemy, it is the sacred duty of every Chinese to oppose American imperialist aggression!" After the forum, Ma Dianru, president of the Suiyuan District Catholic Church, priests Hu Ruhan and Gao Yanshan, and Catholics Zhao Denglian and Zhu Qing, issued a declaration to launch the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. The declaration stated: Our new China has been established, and the Chinese people have stood up, but American imperialism is very jealous. They are trying every means to sabotage us. We Catholics are also Chinese people, and most of us are poor working people (most Catholics in Suiyuan are farmers), and we will never be willing to be slaves of American imperialism. We will rise up together with the people of the whole country to resolutely resist American imperialism, overthrow American imperialism, not rely on it, not collude with it, and we must eliminate the reactionary and erroneous thoughts of being pro-American, worshipping America, and fearing America. We must rely on our own efforts to build a church that is self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating, and never let imperialism stain the sanctity of our church.
　　Following the patriotic expression of the Catholic community in Guisui City, the Catholic communities in Baotou City, the Jining Diocese in eastern Suiyuan, and the Catholic communities in the central Suiyuan Diocese also successively issued declarations, expressing their support for self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, and participation in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. More than 800 Catholics in Jining held a patriotic parade on New Year's Day in 1951.
　　In addition to resolutely expressing their support for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement and participating in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, Catholics in Suiyuan also put forward specific tasks based on the current specific situation in Suiyuan Province, such as exposing elements who collude with imperialism, writing letters of sympathy to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, sending comfort bags, supporting rent reduction, and assisting the government in suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents.
　　In order to expand this movement to every church and every Catholic home in the province, well-known figures in the Catholic community in Suiyuan, Gao Yanshan, Zhu Qing, and Hu Ruhan priests, Ma Dianru, and Zhao Denglian of the Guisui Catholic Church, established the Suiyuan Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Promotion Committee on January 8, preparing to fully launch this movement under unified leadership.

　　绥远天主教人士的爱国运动
    王路  宏贻
    绥远全境十二万天主教徒，已开始卷入中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的正义行动中。
    继全省基督教人士表示拥护革新运动以后，绥远省归绥市六百四十余名中国天主教人士，于一九五○年十二月九日召开了座谈会。会上，很多天主教神甫和天主教办的中、小学校长、教员，以及市民教徒、农民教徒都发了言。他们一致表示要与帝国主义断绝一切联系，实行自治、自传、自养、并要在教徒中广泛展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动，和全国人民团结在一起粉碎美帝国主义的侵略。胡濡汉神甫认为爱教就须爱国。他说：“在国民党反动派统治中国的时代，帝国主义者可以在中国横行，中国人民所受帝国主义的污辱是不堪回首的。现在，为了保卫我们的祖国，我们必须起来反对帝国主义的侵略。”从事教育事业的教徒赵登廉说：“不管是那里的教徒，那里的人，谁反对帝国主义，谁就是我们的朋友。从事各种事业的教徒，都应该起来抗美援朝，因为现在祖国被敌人侵略了，反对美帝国主义侵略是我们每个中国人的神圣任务！”座谈会以后，便由绥远区天主教会会长马殿儒、神甫胡濡汉、高岩山及教徒赵登廉、朱清等发表了开展三自运动的宣言。宣言中称：我们的新中国建立起来了，中国人民都站起来了，而美帝国主义呢，是非常眼红的。他们想尽方法来破坏。我们教友也是中国人民，而且大多数是贫苦的劳动人民（绥远天主教徒大部分是农民），我们决不甘心作美帝的奴隶。我们同全国人民一齐奋起，坚决反抗美帝国主义，打倒美帝国主义，不依赖他，不勾结他，并且要肃清亲美、崇美、恐美的反动和错误的思想。我们要自立更生，建立自治、自养、自传的教会，决不让帝国主义沾污我们教会的圣洁。
    继归绥市天主教界人士的爱国表示之后，包头市的天主教人士，绥东集宁教区及绥中教区的天主教徒，也相继发表了宣言，表示拥护自治、自养、自传及参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动。集宁八百余名天主教界人士，于一九五一年元旦举行了爱国游行。
    绥远天主教人士除了坚决表示拥护三自运动及参加抗美援朝外，还根据绥远省当前具体情况提出了具体任务，如检举与帝国主义有勾结的分子、给朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军写慰问信、送慰问袋，拥护减租，协助政府剿匪肃特等。
    绥远天主教界知名人士，为了把这一运动扩大到全省每个教堂里，每个教徒家里，归绥天主堂的高岩山、朱清、胡濡汉神甫、马殿儒、赵登廉，于一月八日并成立了绥远天主教人士三自爱国促进委员会，准备在统一领导下，使这一运动全面展开。
