　　An Unreasonable and Illegal Matter

　　To the Editor:

　　There is a matter that makes people angry and indignant, and I would like to use a corner of your newspaper to publish it.

　　Du Zechen, the manager of the Mingming Optical Company in Xidan, has always beaten apprentices and abused workers. After liberation, his mind has not yet opened up. He does not allow workers to read newspapers, does not allow workers to talk to outsiders casually, and tries his best to prevent workers from participating in trade unions and other legitimate political or learning activities. When apprentices sleep at night, Manager Du locks their rooms and the young manager opens them in the morning when it is time to go to work. In March of last year, technical worker Li Jiping (who had been working at the company since 1948) and two apprentices were preparing to join the trade union, and Manager Du lured them by saying, "If you don't join the trade union, you will each get an extra 80,000 yuan per month." Later, Manager Du discovered that Li Jiping had already joined the trade union, so he deliberately wanted to dismiss him. In July of the same year, the Third Section of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau summoned Du Zechen to the police station for education because of Li Jiping's household registration problem (Du secretly cancelled Li's household registration in June 1949 when Li returned home due to his mother's illness). Du then dismissed Li on the pretext. During the period when Li Jiping requested mediation from the Second District Trade Union Office and the Municipal Labor Bureau, Du Zechen also stopped Li Jiping's salary and food. Later, Li Jiping filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court. After a thorough understanding of the situation, the Supreme People's Court made the following fair judgment on this case on November 22 of last year: (1) Li Jiping shall be reinstated immediately, and the labor and management parties shall jointly formulate a mutually beneficial labor-management contract in consultation with the local trade union; (2) The workers of Mingming Company have the right to join the trade union, and Manager Du Zechen shall not interfere; (3) Li Jiping shall implement the content of the contract in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit for labor and management, study his profession diligently, and improve production; (4) Du Zechen shall be responsible for compensating Li Jiping for his economic losses during the period of illegal dismissal in principle. The specific method shall be freely agreed upon by both parties. Du Zechen refused to accept such a reasonable and legal judgment and demanded a retrial from the Supreme Court, attempting to be unreasonable. On December 24 of last year, the company was found to have evaded national taxes by the Second Tax Bureau. Manager Du took this as an excuse to clean up the internal affairs and suspended business. Since then, when Li Jiping went to work every morning, Manager Du deliberately did not open the door, refusing to let Li enter to work. Since then, the company has not added any more goods. Li Jiping does not dare to sell the goods that are not displayed on the counter now, and if he does, the manager says, "There are no such goods, I don't care if you sell them." In fact, there is a lot of inventory in the inner counter. This, of course, affects the company's business. Since Li Jiping was reinstated, Manager Du has spent a lot of money, and the young shopkeeper and his family have spent a lot of money, but what about Li Jiping? It has been more than half a year from July of last year to now, and he has not received a penny; he eats and uses what little savings he had in the past and the help of others, and Li Jiping's wife is sick, so it is conceivable that Li Jiping's life is very difficult now. Du Zechen is also aware of this and is preparing to use this trick to force Li Jiping to resign on his own. Editor: Look at how infuriating the illegal and unreasonable things Du Zechen is doing!

### 一件违理违法的事

专栏：读者来信

　　一件违理违法的事编辑同志：
    有一件叫人愤怒不平的事情，想借贵报一角刊登出来。
    本市西单明明眼镜公司经理杜泽臣，一贯就打骂学徒、虐待工人。解放后他的脑筋还不开化，不让工人看报纸，不准工人随便和外人谈话，极力阻挠工人参加工会和其他正当的政治或学习活动等。学徒夜里睡觉时，杜经理把他们的房间上锁，到早晨上班时才由少经理来开放。去年三月间，该公司技术工人李际平（一九四八年即至该公司工作）和两个学徒准备参加工会，杜经理就利诱他们说：“你们如果不参加工会，每月每人增加工资八万元。”后来杜经理发觉李际平已经参加工会，便蓄意要解雇他。同年七月间公安二分局三段派出所因李际平户口问题（一九四九年六月李因母病回家，户口被杜私自撤消了），曾将杜泽臣叫至派出所教育。杜后借故将李解雇，在李际平要求二区工会办事处、市府劳动局调解期间，杜泽臣并停止了李际平的工资和伙食。后来李际平在最高法院起诉，最高人民法院经过切实了解情况，于去年十一月二十二日公正地对此案作出如下判决：（一）李际平即日复工，由劳资双方会同当地工会共同订立劳资两利合同；（二）明明公司的工人有参加工会的权利，经理杜泽臣不得干涉；（三）李际平应本劳资两利政策，履行合同内容，精研业务，提高生产；（四）杜泽臣对李际平非法解雇期间，李际平的经济上的损失原则上应由明明公司负责偿还，具体办法由双方自由协议。对于这样合理合法的判决，杜泽臣拒不接受，又要求最高法院重审，企图刁赖。至去年十二月二十四日，公司因偷漏国税，被税务二分局查出。杜经理就借此借口清理内部，停止营业。此后李际平每天早晨上工时，杜经理便故意不开门，拒绝李入内工作。自此以后，公司并不再添货。柜面上不摆的货，现在李际平就不敢卖，卖了经理就说：“没有这样的货，你卖的我不管。”实际上内柜存货很多。这样当然就影响了该公司的营业。自李际平复工以后，杜经理便大量开支，少掌柜及其家人都大量花钱，但李际平呢？从去年七月到现在已经半年多，一分钱也拿不到；吃的用的都是过去一点积蓄和别人的帮助，李际平媳妇又在生病，可想而知李际平现在的生活是很苦了。杜泽臣也正看准了这点，准备拿这一手来压迫李际平自行告退。编辑同志：你看杜泽臣办的这样违法违理的事，多么使人气愤！
              二区用品业工会全体工人                
    编者按：请北京市总工会调查与处理这一问题，并将结果在报上公布。
