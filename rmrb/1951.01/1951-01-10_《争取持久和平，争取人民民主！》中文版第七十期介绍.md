Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: The Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 70 has been published.

The editorial in this issue is titled "Stop the Arrogant Warmongers!" The editorial points out: The devastating blows that the Chinese and Korean people are inflicting on the American aggressors are the greatest contribution to the cause of peace and the security of all countries. The sympathy and support of all honest people around the world are on the side of the Chinese and Korean people. The editorial denounces Truman's statement on the Korean situation on November 30, 1950, as a war-mongering scream under the mask of "peace." The editorial refutes Truman's nonsense that the Koreans and Chinese are "aggressors." The editorial says, how can anyone with a little common sense say that Korea or China is "aggressing?" Did the Koreans and Chinese attack the United States? Aren't American troops in Korea and Taiwan? If Truman and his ilk are not aggressors, then who are? Why doesn't China, which borders Korea, have the right to defend its borders, while the United States, five thousand miles away, has the right to "defend its security" so far from its borders? The editorial quotes the righteous and stern speech of Wu Xiuquan, representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, at the Security Council: The American imperialists claim that the Korean civil war is said to affect the security of the United States. This is a lie, this is nonsense. Only those who have lost all reason and basic sense of justice would think that there is any reason for the United States to invade Korea and invade China. The editorial points out that the facts after Truman's war-mongering statement prove that fewer and fewer people still believe in America's "peaceful" intentions. In Europe and Asia, Truman's statement has aroused indignant condemnation, fierce protests, and resentment from all walks of life and almost all political parties. This situation has alarmed the arrogant aggressor group. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, under the pressure of mass protests, was forced to make an "explanation," saying that their declaration was "misunderstood." Attlee rushed to Washington to persuade Truman not to take "reckless action." These facts show that the rulers of the Marshallized countries cannot blindly support the future adventures of American aggressors without seriously considering their own fate. The editorial points out that American rulers, like all adventurers, do not understand and therefore naturally underestimate the power of popular resistance, and did not anticipate such a reaction in world opinion to their barbaric statement. MacArthur's military gamble in Korea has resulted in a disastrous defeat for the American army. Truman's political gamble is bound to fail as well. The editorial concludes by calling on peace fighters around the world to fight against the despicable warmongers more actively and resolutely. The editorial states: The common action of the masses against imperialist aggression will surely force the imperialists to retreat. In the global struggle for peace, Communists have always stood and will continue to stand at the forefront, leading by example, inspiring those who waver, persuading those who hesitate, and helping the masses to recognize their strength and find the right path to achieve their aspirations – to defend peace.

This issue also includes "The Primary Task of Communist Newspapers," the full text of Wu Xiuquan's speech at the United Nations Security Council meeting on November 28, 1950, entitled "On American Armed Aggression Against China," and the article "Against the Rearmament of West Germany" by Max Reimann, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany.

In addition, this issue also includes articles such as "Socialist Competition in the People's Republic of Bulgaria" and "The Yellow International of London."

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第七十期介绍
    【新华社八日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第七十期已经出版。
    该刊本期社论题为“制止狂妄的战争贩子们！”社论指出：中朝人民所正在给予美国侵略者的摧毁性的打击，是对和平事业和所有国家的安全的最大贡献，全世界一切正直的人的同情和支持都站在中朝人民一边。社论指斥杜鲁门一九五○年十一月三十日关于朝鲜事件所发表的声明，是在“和平”假面具下的战争歇斯底里的叫嚣。社论驳斥了杜鲁门所指的朝鲜人和中国人是“侵略”的胡说。社论说，任何人只要还有一点常识，怎么能说朝鲜或中国是“侵略”呢？难道朝鲜人和中国人进攻了美国？不是美国的军队在朝鲜和台湾吗？如果杜鲁门之流不是侵略者，那么谁是侵略者呢？为什么与朝鲜毗邻的中国没有权利保卫它的边疆，而在五千英里以外的美国，倒有权利在距离国境如此遥远的地方“保卫它的安全”？社论引证了中华人民共和国中央人民政府伍修权代表在安全理事会上义正词严的发言：美帝国主义者宣称，朝鲜的内战据说是影响了美国的安全，这是谎话，这是无稽之谈。只有丧失一切理性和起码的正义感的人，才会认为美国的侵略朝鲜和侵略中国有任何理由。社论指出：杜鲁门的这一战争歇斯底里声明发表以后的事实证明：仍然相信美国的“和平”意图的人是越来越少了。在欧洲和亚洲，杜鲁门的声明引起了各阶层人民以及几乎所有政治党派的激愤的斥责、猛烈的抗议和愤慨。这种情况，已使狂妄的侵略者集团内部惊慌失措。意外长史佛卓，在群众抗议的压力下，被迫做了一次“解释”：说是他们的宣言“被误解了”。艾德礼赶到华盛顿，要说服杜鲁门不采取“鲁莽行动”。这些事实说明马歇尔化国家的统治者，并不能盲目地赞助美国侵略者的未来冒险，而不认真地考虑一下他们本身的命运。社论指出，美国统治者，和所有的冒险者一样，并不了解，因而也就自然而然地低估了人民反抗的力量，没有预料到在世界舆论方面会对他们的野蛮声明发出这样的反响。麦克阿瑟在朝鲜的军事赌博造成了美国军队的惨败。杜鲁门的政治赌博也一定同样失败的。社论最后号召全世界和平战士们更积极、更坚决地对卑鄙的战争贩子们作战。社论称：人民大众反对帝国主义侵略的共同行动一定会迫使帝国主义者退却。在全世界争取和平的斗争中，共产党人一向站在、而且将继续站在最前线，以身作则，鼓舞那些动摇分子，说服那些犹豫的人们，帮助群众去认识他们的力量并且找出正确的道路，以达成他们的抱负——保卫和平。
    该刊这一期登载了《共产党报刊的首要任务》、伍修权代表在一九五○年十一月二十八日联合国安全理事会会议上题为《关于美国武装侵略中国》的发言全文和德国共产党主席雷曼所作《反对重新武装西德》的论文。
    另外，本期还登载了《保加利亚人民共和国的社会主义竞赛》、《伦敦黄色国际》等论文。
