　　The Taiyuan Railway Bureau
     Should Improve the Work of the Trade Union
     The Taiyuan Railway Bureau's trade union has achieved some success in its past work, but the following problems still exist seriously:
     (1) Financial affairs are not transparent. The income and expenditure of funds and labor insurance fees have never been announced to members.
     (2) The phenomenon of workshop directors running the trade union is very serious. In the past, the director of the trade union was concurrently the personnel section chief of the engineering department. At that time, there were no cadres detached from production, and no office space. It was difficult for employees to find the director when they had something to do. Now, the chairman of the trade union is a section chief of the political department, and the vice chairman is the secretary of the Communist Youth League general branch. Therefore, the employees say: "Our trade union is composed of the essence of the Party, the government, and the Youth League." Since most of the trade union leaders are responsible comrades of the administration, the Party or the Youth League, although they have unlimited enthusiasm, they have a lot of original work and cannot consider the work of the trade union well, forming a trade union in name only. The same is true for grassroots organizations. Take the General Affairs Office central group, which has 185 members, for example, the central group leader, Wu Menglan, is the director of the administrative guest house.
     (3) Neglecting to lead cultural learning. With the improvement of political awareness, the vast number of employees urgently need to learn culture. Therefore, in August last year, the trade union established a middle school level cultural tutoring class and a primary cultural class to facilitate workers' learning. Despite the high enthusiasm of the employees for learning, these two unique employee cultural learning organizations were only a flash in the pan, and have been collapsing from November last year until now. When workers ask the trade union, the answer they get is: "Don't study culture now, vigorously study politics." Recently, the Taiyuan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held the Second Workers' Representative Conference. Although people from the Railway Bureau's trade union went to participate, no one has conveyed the spirit of the conference to the employees until now. What exactly is the content of this conference? What resolutions were made? The employees are confused.
     The year 1951 has arrived, and it is hoped that the trade union will work hard to improve its work.

### 太原铁路局  应改进机关工会工作

　　太原铁路局 
    应改进机关工会工作
    太原铁路管理局机关工会，在过去工作中虽有一定的成绩，但目前还严重地存在着下列问题：
    （一）财政不公开。经费、劳保费的收入与支出，从来没有向会员宣布过。
    （二）由工长来办工会的现象很严重。在过去工会主任是工务处人事股长兼任。那时没有脱离生产干部，也没办公地点。职工们有事很难找到主任。现在工会的正主席是政治部某科长，副主席是青年团总支书记，因此职工们说：“咱们工会，是集党、政、青的精华而组成的。”由于工会负责人绝大部分是行政或党团的负责同志，尽管他们有无限的热情，但原来工作很多，也就不可能很好的考虑工会工作，形成有名无实。基层组织也是如此。就拿有会员一百八十五人的总务处中心小组来说，中心小组长吴梦兰就是行政上的招待所所长。
    （三）忽视领导文化学习。广大职工随着政治觉悟的提高，迫切需要学习文化。因此去年八月工会成立了一个中学程度的文化补习班，一个便利工友学习的初级文化班。尽管职工们学习热情如何高涨，这两个唯一的职工文化学习组织，仅是昙花一现，从去年的十一月，一直垮到现在。工友们询问工会，所得答复是：“现在不学文化，大力学习政治。”最近太原市总工会召开了二届工人代表会议，路局机关工会虽然有人去参加，可是直到现在还没有人给职工们传达会议的精神。这个会议的内容究竟是什么？有那些决议？职工们莫明其妙。
    一九五一年已经到了，希望该工会努力改进工作。
