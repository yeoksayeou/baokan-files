　　Great Friendship – On the Friendly Relationship between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People
　　By our special correspondent Li Wei
    The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, filled with intense hatred for American imperialism, love for their motherland, and deep friendship for the Korean people, joined the battle on the Korean battlefield.
    The soldiers of the Volunteer Army firmly remembered their oath: "Protect every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea; do not take a single needle or thread from the Korean people." This oath was to be carried out in thought and action.
    When first coming into contact with the Korean people, they were unfamiliar with the place and unable to communicate verbally. How could they express their feelings? The soldiers would rather endure hardship themselves than commit any possible error. Entire squads, platoons, and companies of soldiers would rather spend the night in the cold wind than disturb the local people when arriving at their campsite at night. When the entire cadre and soldiers of the Seventh Company of a certain unit stayed in Jin Yu Dong, because the masses refused to accept money when buying vegetables, and they could not explain the reason due to language barriers, they would rather the entire company go without vegetables for a meal than eat the Korean people's things for free. When the Eighth Company of a certain unit was stationed in Haojing City, the cooks lived in the house of a family surnamed Bian. Because the Bian family did not yet understand the Volunteer Army, they had left and there was no one in the house. The cooks looked for pots to cook rice and found a pot of corn rice and a pot of pork already cooked there, so they took care of them as they were. When the villagers returned and found the cooked food intact, they were very happy. The old landlady brought rice and meat to the soldiers, but the soldiers firmly refused to eat it, and explained the discipline of the People's Army with words and gestures. The old lady praised repeatedly, "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is the best!" During a march, a warhorse of the Ninth Company of the same unit kicked a stone off the road, breaking a villager's jar below the mountain, and immediately compensated 400 Korean won. Whenever the soldiers arrived at a place, they immediately swept the courtyard for the landlord and filled the water tank with water. When leaving, they cleaned the inside and outside of the house and put things back in their original place. These "silent" propagandas universally moved the Korean people.
    The soldiers diligently learned important conversational phrases from the Korean staff members in the army, such as "Villager," "Is there a house," "Thank you for your trouble," "Thank you," "Goodbye," "Don't be afraid," "Comrade," "People's Volunteer Army"... Many Korean people were also learning Chinese, saying "Yours, very good!" "Please come in!" "You're welcome!" "Long live Mao Zedong!"...
    A vehicle from the logistics unit of a certain Volunteer Army overturned near Shuozhou, and three people were slightly injured. They camped in the wild. At dawn, they went to the villagers' homes in the mountain gullies to find water to drink. A twelve or thirteen-year-old child led them to a place to stay. The old landlady immediately made rice for them to eat. These comrades reluctantly said they had already eaten; the old landlady then took out tobacco leaves for everyone to smoke. In the afternoon, Korean People's Army comrades living in the village sent rice, vegetables, and meat, giving them a rich dinner. At night, the People's Army sent a platoon of people to help rescue the overturned vehicle. A comrade from the People's Army who could speak Chinese said, "We have to find a way to get the car back on the road, we won't go back if we don't get it on the road!"
    On the highway on the high mountains by the Yalu River, a People's Army vehicle swerved to the side of the road, below which was a steep slope. The war support team organized by the cultural instructor of a certain Volunteer Army regiment saw it and immediately worked together to pull the vehicle back onto the road. The comrades of the People's Army shook hands with them cordially and thanked them.
    When the rear office of a certain Volunteer Army was stationed in a mountain gully near Xincang, everyone launched a vigorous campaign to help farmers with the autumn harvest. All staff and guards and communications personnel helped the masses thresh grain, went to the mountains in groups to collect firewood and carried it back to the homes of the masses, helped the masses chop corn stalks to feed cattle, and the health station provided free medical treatment to the local masses.
    The comrades of a certain artillery unit not only dug many air-raid shelters in their residence but also helped residents dig air-raid shelters, build air-raid stoves, and used large carts to help the masses who lacked labor to transport public grain. The position of a certain machine gun company was in a cotton field. The soldiers first picked all the unharvested cotton before starting to dig shelters.
    The highest friendship of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the Korean people is manifested on the battlefield. They use self-sacrificing and brave fighting to eliminate the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people - American imperialism and its accomplices. Daily actions moved the Korean people, and military victories encouraged the Korean people. The soldiers knew that their actions represented the motherland. And the strong support of the Korean people is also an indispensable factor for the victory of the People's Volunteer Army in fighting alongside the Korean People's Army. Under the leadership of the Korean People's Government and the Labor Party, the Korean people in various places universally organized transportation teams, stretcher teams, repair teams, and self-defense teams for sentry duty. When the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army annihilated the enemy on the front line of the Qingchuan River, a warm grain transportation campaign unfolded in the rural areas of the northern Korean mountains. The Korean people themselves tightened their belts and saved on food and clothing, but sent large quantities of grain to the front line. During the Second Battle, farmers in every household fried large amounts of corn and soybeans in pots, and then used hand-pushed small stone mills to grind the fried grain into roasted flour, packed it into bags, and sent it to the soldiers on the front line as dry food. Every night, there were endless grain delivery teams transporting grain to the front line along the snow-covered mountain roads. The elderly and women, driving oxen and pulling sleds, disregarded the wind and snow, and even disregarded the harassment of enemy aircraft during the day, and enthusiastically supplied the front line. Every household used the wood they cut from the mountains to make stretchers. Many people joined the stretcher teams, participated in the war, and rescued and transported the wounded. Most of those who participated in the repair teams were women. They used all available tools and risked air strikes to repair roads, filling in uneven places, widening narrow places, paving mountain bends with sand, and nailing rows of wooden stakes along the outer edges of the bends to avoid danger due to snow sealing the road surface. This reduced traffic accidents and reduced the phenomenon of road congestion due to narrow roads and difficulty in passing each other.
    Soldiers kill enemies at the front, and the people fight against enemy agents and spies in the rear. At the sentry posts of the Volunteer Army, the Korean people sent people to help check pedestrians; they participated in searching mountains for agents and captured those spies who signaled enemy aircraft. In this way, the security of the rear during wartime was increasingly consolidated. After the liberation of Pyongyang, I participated in a military-civilian get-together in Wanfengli. This meeting was both a celebration and a show of appreciation for the troops. The soldiers of the Volunteer Army and local residents gathered in an elementary school. The venue was decorated simply and solemnly, with two eye-catching slogans written in Chinese characters, one was "Long live General Kim Il-sung, leader of the Korean people," and the other was "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese people." At the meeting, the chairman of the village government People's Committee, the secretary of the Labor Party branch, and the principal of the elementary school all spoke, expressing their celebration of the liberation of Pyongyang, thanking the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for their joint operations, and calling on them to work hard to support the front line. Women representatives presented flowers to the Volunteer Army representatives attending the meeting. All residents, the Farmers' Alliance, and the elementary school presented the Volunteer Army with two flags with the words "Condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army" in Korean and Chinese. The Farmers' Alliance also presented the troops with a large fat pig; the troops politely declined, but the Korean people present decided on the spot to send this pig to the front line to improve the food for the Volunteer Army soldiers. When the representative of the troops spoke, the Korean people constantly applauded and cheered excitedly. A group of lively children danced many Korean folk dances on the stage and sang many revolutionary songs. Many women, in order to participate in this grand event, put on new red and green clothes, as if celebrating a festival.
    When our troops were stationed in Wanfengli, the family I lived in was surnamed Che, and the landlord was called Che Chengzhen. One night, this old man in his sixties came to the house where I lived. He excitedly told me that his eldest son had already joined the army and was now a captain, and his second son had also joined the People's Army today. Only he and his thirteen-year-old daughter, a daughter-in-law, and three children were left in the family. He said that his two sons were both members of the Labor Party, and he sent them to fight the "Mi Gu Gun" (American soldiers). While speaking, he gestured with both hands like bayonet fighting. I used the two Korean phrases I had just learned to say to him: "Zhong Chao yinmin neng, han ji ban shalami ni da." (The Chinese and Korean people are one family), "Wu li deli, gongtong han caogen, mi gu zeguyizhiyi mu ni da." (Our common enemy is American imperialism). He laughed loudly, said something I couldn't understand, and shook my hand warmly.

　　伟大的友情——记中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民的友爱关系
    本报特约记者  李伟
    中国人民志愿军的战士们怀着对美国帝国主义强烈的憎恨，怀着对祖国的热爱，怀着对朝鲜人民深厚的友情，在朝鲜战场上参加了战斗的行列。
    志愿军的战士们牢牢记住自己的誓言：“爱护朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木；不动朝鲜人民的一针一线。”要从思想到实际行动，贯彻这个誓言。
    当初次和朝鲜人民接触的时候，人地生疏，言语不通，怎样来表达出这个心情呢？战士们往往是宁使自己忍苦耐劳，决不犯可能发生的错误。有整班、整排、整连的战士们因为夜晚到达宿营地不愿惊动老乡而在寒风中露宿的。某部七连的全体指战员住在金玉洞的时候，由于买菜时群众不肯要钱，因语言隔阂又无法把道理讲通，宁肯全连一顿饭不吃菜，也不肯白吃朝鲜人民的东西。某部八连住宿在好井市，当时炊事班住在一家姓边的老百姓的房子里，因为姓边的那家人还不了解志愿军，所以躲出去了，房子里没有一个人。炊事员们找锅煮饭，发现这家已焖好一锅苞米饭，煮熟一锅猪肉放在那里，大家就原封不动地给照管起来。当老乡回来以后，发现煮好的饭菜还原样地留在那儿，非常高兴。房东老太太给战士们端来饭和肉，战士们坚决不肯吃，并且用语言和手势解释人民军队的纪律，老太太连声称赞：“中国人民志愿军顶好！”该部九连的军马在行军中从路上踢下一块石头，打碎了山下老乡的一个罐子，立即赔了四百元朝鲜币。战士们每到一地，立即给房东把院子扫光，水缸里装满水。离开时把房里房外打扫干净，东西放到原处。这些“无言”的宣传，普遍地感动了朝鲜人民。
    战士们向部队中的朝鲜籍工作员努力学习重要的交际语言，如“老乡”、“房子有没有”、“辛苦了”、“谢谢”、“再见”、“不要怕”、“同志”、“人民志愿军”……。不少的朝鲜人民也在学习中国语言，说着“你的，顶好！”“请进来吧！”“不客气吧！”“毛泽东万岁！”……。
    志愿军某部后勤部队的一辆汽车在朔州附近翻车了，三个人受了轻伤，他们就在野地露营。天亮后，他们到山沟里老百姓家找水喝，一个十二、三岁的小孩带领他们找到一个住处。房东老大娘马上就给他们做饭吃。这几个同志硬着肚皮说吃过了；老大娘又拿出烟叶让大家吸。下午，住在本村的朝鲜人民军同志们给送来了大米和菜、肉，使他们吃了一顿丰富的晚餐。夜晚，人民军派了一排人来帮助救援翻了的车。人民军中会说中国话的同志说：“怎么也得想法子把车搞到道上来，搞不上道我们是不回去的！”
    在鸭绿江边高山的公路上，一辆人民军的汽车歪到路边上了，下面便是斜陡的高坡，志愿军某团由文化教员组织起来的战勤工作队看见了，马上一齐动手把这辆车拉回到公路上。人民军同志们亲切地和他们握手道谢。
    志愿军某部后方机关住在新仓附近的一条山沟里的时候，大家发动了轰轰烈烈的帮助农民秋收运动。全体工作人员和警卫通信人员们，帮助群众打场，成群结队地上山打柴，背回到群众家里，帮助群众铡苞米秸喂牛，卫生所给当地群众免费看病。
    炮兵某部的同志们，不仅自己在住地挖了许多防空掩体，而且帮助居民挖防空洞，修防空火灶，用大车帮助缺少劳动力的群众运送公粮。某机炮连的阵地是一片棉花地，战士们首先把尚未收完的棉花都摘下，然后才动手挖掩体。
    人民志愿军对朝鲜人民最崇高的友情是表现在战场上，他们用自我牺牲的勇敢战斗去消灭中朝人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义及其帮凶。日常行动感动着朝鲜人民，军事胜利鼓舞着朝鲜人民。战士们知道自己的行动是代表着祖国的。而朝鲜人民的大力支援，也是人民志愿军在与朝鲜人民军并肩战斗中取得胜利的不可缺少的因素。  在朝鲜人民政府和劳动党领导下，各地朝鲜人民普遍地组织了运输队、担架队、修复队和站岗放哨的自卫队。当朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在清川江前线歼灭敌人的时候，朝鲜北部山地的农村中展开热烈的运粮工作。朝鲜人民自己节衣缩食，却把大批粮食送往前线。在第二次战役中，农民们家家把大量的苞米和黄豆用锅炒熟，而后用手推的小石磨把炒熟的粮食磨成炒面，装上袋子，送给前线的战士们做干粮。每天夜晚都有络绎不绝的送粮队顺着雪封了的山路往前线输送。老人们，妇女们，赶着黄牛，拉着爬犁，不顾风雪吹打，甚至白天不顾敌人飞机骚扰，热烈供应前线。家家户户用自己从山上砍下的木材做成担架。许多人参加担架队，参加战争，救运伤员。参加修复队的，大半是妇女。她们利用所有可以利用的工具，冒着空袭危险去修路，把不平的地方填平，把窄的地方加宽，把大山拐弯的地方铺上砂土，并在拐角的外沿钉上一排一排的木桩，以避免因雪封路面而发生危险。这样就使得翻车的事故减少了，使道路由于太窄不好错车而拥塞的现象减少了。
    战士们在前方杀敌，人民在后方对敌特、奸细作斗争。在志愿军的岗哨上，朝鲜人民派人帮助盘查行人；参加搜山查特务，捕捉那些给敌机打信号的奸细。这样，使战时的后方治安日益巩固。  平壤光复以后，我参加了完丰里的一个军民联欢大会。这个会又是祝捷，又是劳军。志愿军的战士们和当地居民集合在一所小学校里。会场上布置得简单而庄严，有两条用中国字写的醒目的标语，一条是“朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军万岁”，一条是“中国人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁”。会上，村政府人民委员长、劳动党支部书记，小学校校长都讲了话，表示庆祝平壤的解放，感谢中国人民志愿军的协同作战，号召努力支援前线。妇女代表给到会的志愿军代表献花。全体居民、农民同盟和小学校给志愿军送了二面旗子，旗子上写着“慰问中国人民志愿军”的朝、中两国文字。农民同盟还赠送部队一口大肥猪；部队婉词谢绝了，而到会的朝鲜人民还是当场决定把这一口猪送到前线上给志愿军战士们改善伙食。当部队代表讲话的时候，朝鲜人民不断地兴奋地鼓掌和欢呼。一群活泼的小孩们，在台子上跳了许多朝鲜民族舞蹈，唱了许多革命歌曲。许多妇女们，为了参加这个盛会，穿上红绿的新衣，像过节一样。
    我们驻军在完丰里时，我住的那家老百姓姓车，房东叫车成珍。有一天夜晚，这个六十来岁的老人找到我住的房子里来，他兴奋地对我讲，他的大儿子早已参军，现在当队长，二儿子今天也参加人民军去了。家中只剩下他和他的十三岁的女孩子，一个儿媳妇和三个小孩。他说，他的两个儿子都是劳动党党员，他送他们去打“米谷滚”（美国军）去。说话的时候，他用两只手比着拚刺刀的样子。我用才学会的两句朝鲜话对他说：“中早银民能，汗记半沙拉米你大。”（中朝人民是一家人），“吾力得力，共同汗草根，米谷则谷主义一木你大。”（我们的共同敌人是美国帝国主义）。他哈哈大笑着，说着我听不懂的话，和我亲切地握起手来。
