　　Notice from the Publishing Administration Soliciting Newly Published Books and Periodicals
    In order to preserve book and periodical editions and conduct investigation and research, this Administration began sending circulars to public, joint public-private, and private publishers nationwide in early 1950, soliciting first editions and reprint editions of books and periodicals published after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Over the past year, the vast majority of publishers have submitted materials according to the procedures stipulated by this Administration. This Administration has now begun compiling the first national new book catalog since the founding of the People's Republic of China (covering the period from October 1, 1949, to the end of December 1950) and has decided to compile and print a national new book catalog monthly from this year onwards, which will be distributed to book distribution agencies and libraries nationwide for reference. Fearing that previous notices may not have been comprehensive, we hereby request that publishers nationwide note: Publishers who have not received the solicitation notice from this Administration are requested to send sample copies of first editions and reprint editions of books and periodicals published after October 1, 1949 (three copies of each first edition book or periodical, one copy of each reprint edition book or periodical), to the Book and Periodical Department of the Publishing Administration, No. 10 Dongzongbu Hutong, Beijing. From 1951 onwards, newly published books and periodicals must be submitted within three days of publication. The Administration has also printed "Measures for Soliciting Newly Published Books and Periodicals," which will be sent upon request. This notice.

　　出版总署征集新出版图书、期刊启事
    本署为保存书刊版本及进行调查研究，自一九五○年初，开始通函向全国公营、公私合营和私营出版家征集中华人民共和国成立以后印行的初版、重版图书及期刊。一年以来，绝大多数出版家均已按照本署规定办法缴送。现在本署已经着手编印中华人民共和国成立后第一次全国新书目录（时期从一九四九年十月一日起至一九五○年十二月底止），并决定从本年起，按月编印全国新书目录，分发全国各图书发行机构及图书馆参考。诚恐以前通知未周，兹特请全国出版家注意：凡未接到本署征集书刊通知的出版家，务希将一九四九年十月一日以后出版之初版、重版图书、期刊样本（初版书刊每种三份，重版书刊每种一份），邮寄北京东总布胡同十号出版总署图书期刊司收。从一九五一年起，新出版的图书期刊，务希于出版后三天内即行缴送。本署另印有“征集新出图书期刊办法”，函索即寄。此启。
