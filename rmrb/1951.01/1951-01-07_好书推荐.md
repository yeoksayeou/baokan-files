    "Investigation of Rural Conditions in the Central South Provinces"
    Compiled and printed by the Central South General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore

    Among the publications on the investigation and research of actual rural conditions, the book "Investigation of Rural Conditions in the Central South Provinces," published by the Central South Xinhua Bookstore, is worth recommending to readers. The book includes six investigation reports from the Research Office of the Central South Land Reform Committee and other institutions. The materials are very practical and show the general outline of land distribution in feudal rural China. There are also five research papers and reports on the rural conditions in the five Central South provinces, which provide in-depth analysis of the tenant-landlord relationship in the Central South rural areas. In addition, there are two editorials from the "Yangtze Daily," which are guiding articles. This book is suitable for the current needs of the land reform movement and can be used as a reference for those studying land reform documents and engaging in practical work.

    The general situation of land distribution in the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong in the Central South region is as follows: "Landlords, accounting for 3.5% of the agricultural population, own approximately 30% to 50% of the total cultivated land area; while middle peasants, poor peasants, and farm laborers, accounting for 90% of the agricultural population, only own approximately 30% to 50% of the cultivated land... In the five provinces, the landlord population is about 3.4 million, owning a total of between 100 million and 140 million mu of cultivated land, averaging 30 to 40 mu per person. The population of middle peasants, poor peasants, and farm laborers is about 77 million to 87.6 million, and the area of cultivated land they own is roughly equal to that owned by the landlord class, which is only one twenty-fifth of the number of peasants. Farmers own an average of only one to one and a half mu of cultivated land per person." That is to say, the land owned by one landlord is equal to the total land owned by twenty-five peasants. From the examples of individual villages, in Yongjian Village, Huangpi County, Hubei Province, landlords owned an average of 36.8 dou of land per person, with the highest owning more than 100 dou of land per person. Poor peasants owned an average of only 0.67 dou of land per person, with the lowest owning 0.02 dou of land. In the lakeside area of Hunan, land was most concentrated. In Xiangyin, "landlords account for only about 2% of the households in the county but own 71% of the land." In Jiangxi, even in the old revolutionary areas where land was relatively dispersed, "landlords, averaging 2.5% of the rural population, still own 25%-30% of the land."

    While holding large amounts of land, landlords relied on reactionary forces or directly controlled some armed forces, using various methods to exploit the peasants. Their exploitation of the peasants mainly involved renting out land. The general rent amount in the Central South provinces was very high. "According to a survey of twelve typical villages in six special districts of Hubei Province, regardless of fixed rent, flexible rent, or share rent, the rent amount is generally between 40% and 60%, 70% of the normal yield of the land. In Shaoyang County, Hunan, the rent amount is usually above 60% of the normal yield of the land, with the highest reaching more than 80%." In addition, there were also profit sharing of by-products and the deposit rent system—peasants had to pay the landlord a certain amount of deposit when renting land from the landlord. There were even more numerous forms of extra exploitation and unpaid labor.

    Impoverished peasants often worked hard all year round but could not get enough to eat and were still in debt. The exploitation of usury was also shockingly high. For example, in Jiangxi, "The peasant Hong Guangwen borrowed 60 silver dollars from the landlord Wen Kuijie twenty years ago, with an annual interest of six dan of grain. He paid six dan of interest in the first year, but when he failed to pay in the second year, interest was compounded, and after six years, the interest owed amounted to more than 200 yuan. Finally, he owed 86 silver dollars and could not repay them, so he had to hand over his uncle's one mu of paddy field, his only six fen of vegetable garden land, a tea mountain, a bamboo mountain, and two houses to the landlord Wen Kuijie." Peasants lived under such cruel exploitation, struggling on the verge of starvation all year round. Their enthusiasm for production was low, and grain production gradually decreased. "In the Jingzhou area of Hubei Province, paddy fields could produce 7 dan of grain per mu before 1930, but in 1940, it decreased to about 5 dan per mu, and in 1949, it decreased to 4 dan." The parasitic landlord class, who held land, never participated in production. The landlord "Huang family in Langli Township, Changsha, Hunan, collected more than 1,000 shi of rent a year and exploited the peasants by lending out the collected deposits at high interest rates. Most of the family lived in Changsha, leading a life of extravagance and debauchery."

    The old Chinese rural feudal and unreasonable relations of production led to the bankruptcy of the rural economy and hindered the development of productivity. Land reform was an urgent need for the vast number of peasants who accounted for 90% of the rural population. These situations are fully demonstrated in the materials in this book.

   "The Chinese Countryside After Land Reform"
    Compiled by Chen Rongfu, published by Popular Culture Publishing House

    From the beginning of the People's Liberation War in 1946 until June 1950, during this period, land reform had been completed in areas with approximately 145 million agricultural population (out of a total population of approximately 160 million) in China. This vigorous mass revolutionary movement in such a vast area has powerfully changed the face of China. The booklet "The Chinese Countryside After Land Reform" preliminarily summarizes the progressive impact of this change on various aspects of the countryside. Although it is not a research work, it is a well-written and relatively popular reader. The entire book is basically a collection of newspaper and magazine materials, speaking to readers entirely with facts, and therefore has great persuasiveness.

    The book is divided into twelve sections. The first section, "Achieving Land to the Tiller," roughly describes the situation of land reform that has been carried out; the second section, "Working on Their Own Land," explains the upsurge in peasants' enthusiasm for production after obtaining land; the third to seventh sections explain the progress in various aspects of agricultural production; the eighth section, "Paving the Way for Industrialization," describes the beneficial impact of the land reform movement on industry and commerce; the ninth to twelfth sections comprehensively introduce the improvement of peasants in terms of life, culture, and politics.

    How the peasants who were allocated land embraced the enthusiasm to improve productivity can be illustrated by the following two sentences filled with the pride and confidence of the working people: "I want to turn the poor mountain into a rich mountain!" "I want to turn the poor gully into a rich gully!" For example, Shi Cunjin, a labor hero in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, planted four mu and four fen of land, which used to belong to the landlord. Before the land reform, each mu could yield seven or eight dou of grain at best, but in 1949 after the land reform, he harvested a total of sixteen shi of grain. Xu Zhaoxiang, a peasant in Xiaoqiaocun, Ye Ting County, Northern Jiangsu, was allocated ten mu and six fen of land in the land reform. Originally, each mu could only yield about 200 jin per season, but after his meticulous cultivation, each mu yielded more than 350 jin.

    The book has a good description of how the working peasants are gradually seizing richer labor fruits from nature, gradually getting rid of the status of being enslaved by the natural world, and the progress of agricultural productivity in various aspects. Li Shunda, a labor hero in the Taihang Mountains, said: "In the past, people did not want to plant the land as well as they do now, but where did the capital come from?" Land reform began to prepare this capital for the peasants, improving technology, improving agricultural implements, improving soil, improving irrigation, improving seeds... All of this is no longer scientists closing themselves in the laboratory, but the subject of tireless research by the vast number of peasants. For example, in Anyang and other counties in Pingyuan Province, peasants urgently demanded the improvement of technology. They automatically demarcated land on the edges of the fields to conduct agricultural experiments, and their homes were filled with pots and jars for seed soaking experiments.

    The reclamation of wasteland and the increase of cultivated land is a great achievement. The peasants who turned over stood up from the shackles of the old society and tenaciously attacked the "barren hills." In the Northeast alone, a total of more than 14.7 million mu of cultivated land were added due to reclamation in 1948 and 1949, and more than 5.3 million mu were reclaimed in the spring and summer of 1950.

    The rural production level in the Northeast and North China has rapidly recovered to near the pre-war level after experiencing long-term war damage, and some areas have even exceeded the pre-war level. This recovery speed is faster than the recovery speed of Soviet agriculture after the October Revolution. Although there are various reasons for this, the profound awakening of the infinite labor potential of Chinese peasants through land reform is undoubtedly the most fundamental reason.

    In general, this book is a good reference book with rich materials for studying land reform issues and studying changes in the rural economy.

    《中南各省农村情况调查》
    新华书店中南总分店编印
    关于农村实际情况调查研究的出版物中，中南新华书店出版《中南各省农村情况调查》一书是值得向读者推荐的。这本书的内容包括中南土地改革委员会调研处等机构的六篇调查报告，材料很实际，可以看出中国封建农村土地分配的大概轮廓，还有五篇是关于中南五省农村情况的研究性的论文和报导，对中南农村的租佃关系有较深入的分析；另外二篇是《长江日报》的社论，是指导性的文章。这本书适合当前土改运动的需要，可供学习土改文件和从事实际工作者作为参考资料。
    中南区河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广东五省土地分配的总情况是这样的：“占农业人口百分之三·五的地主，占有耕地约为耕地总面积的百分之三十到百分之五十；而占农业人口百分之九十的中农、贫农和雇农，只占有百分之三十到百分之五十左右的耕地……，五省中地主人口约为三百四十万，共占有的耕地当在一亿到一亿四千万亩之间，每人平均占有三十亩到四十亩。中农、贫农和雇农的人口约为七千七百万到八千七百六十多万，占有耕地的面积却和在人数上只有农民二十五分之一的地主阶级所占有的耕地大致相等。农民们每人平均只有耕地一亩到一亩半左右。”就是说，一个地主所拥有的土地，等于二十五个农民所有土地的总和。从个别村的例子来看，湖北黄陂县永建村地主每人平均占有三六·八斗田，最高者每人平均一○○斗田以上。贫农每人平均仅占有○·六七斗田，最低者为○·○二斗田。湖南滨湖区域土地最集中，在湘阴，“全县地主只占户数百分之二左右，占有土地达百分之七十一。”在江西，即使是老土地革命区中土地比较分散的地区，“平均占农村人口百分之二·五的地主，仍占有土地百分之二十五——三十。”
    地主一方面握有大量土地，一方面依靠反动势力或直接掌握一部分武装，利用各种方式对农民进行剥削。他们对农民的剥削，主要的是出租土地，中南各省一般租额都很高。“据湖北省六个专区中十二个典型村庄的调查，不管定额租、活租或分租，租额一般都在土地正产物的百分之四十到百分之六十、百分之七十之间，湖南邵阳县的租额，通常都在土地正产物的百分之六十以上，最高达到百分之八十多。”此外还有副产物分益和押租金制——农民向地主租入土地时，须付给地主一定数量的押金。额外剥削和无偿劳役更是名目繁多。
    贫苦农民往往终年辛勤劳动，不得一饱，还要负债。高利贷的剥削也是高到可惊的程度，如江西“农民洪光文为他在前二十年借了地主温魁杰六十块光洋，年息六担谷。第一年交了六担息，第二年没交上就利上加利，息上加息，滚了六年，还息达二百元之多，最后欠八十六块光洋无法还，只好将伯父的一亩水田，自己仅有的六分菜园土，一块茶山，一块竹山，两间房子一并交给了地主温魁杰。”农民在这样残酷的剥削下生活，终年贫困，在饥饿线上挣扎，生产情绪低落，粮产便日渐减少了。“湖北省荆州一带的稻田，在一九三○年以前，每亩可产谷七担，一九四○年每亩降到五担左右，一九四九年降到四担。”而寄生的地主阶级，他们握有土地，可从不参加生产，湖南长沙榔黎乡地主“黄家一年收租千石以上，并把收取之押金放高利贷剥削农民。一家人大都住在长沙，过着花天酒地的生活。”
    旧中国农村封建的不合理的生产关系，使农村经济陷于破产，阻碍了生产力的发展，土地改革对占农村人口百分之九十的广大农民是怎样迫切的需要，这些情形，从这本书的材料中充分表现出来了。

   《土地改革后的中国农村》
    陈榕甫编著  通俗文化出版社出版
    从一九四六年人民解放战争开始时直到一九五○年六月，这一时期中，全中国大约已经有一亿四千五百万农业人口（总人口约一亿六千万）的地区，完成了土地改革。这样广大区域的轰轰烈烈的群众革命运动，有力地改变了中国的面貌。《土地改革后的中国农村》这本小册子，初步综合地叙述了这一改变在农村各方面的进步影响，虽然它还不是研究性的著作，却是一本写得很好的比较通俗的读物。全书基本上都是集纳报纸杂志材料而成，完全用事实向读者讲话，因此具有很大的说服力。
    全书共分十二节。第一节“实现了耕者有其田”，大略地叙述已进行过的土地改革的情况；第二节“在自己的土地上劳动”，说明农民得到土地后生产情绪的高涨；第三节至第七节，说明农业生产中的各方面的进步；第八节“为工业化开路”，叙述土地改革运动给予工商业的有利影响；第九节至十二节，综合地介绍农民在生活上、文化上、政治上提高的情形。
    分得了土地的农民如何抱着无比的热情提高生产力，可用下面两句充满着劳动人民的自豪与自信的话来说明：“我要它穷山变富山！”“我要它穷沟变富沟！”例如山西黎城县霍家窑劳动英雄石寸金种四亩四分地，从前是地主所有的，土改前每亩顶好能收七八斗粮食，土改后的一九四九年却共收了十六石粮食。苏北叶挺县小桥村新沟邦农民胥朝向，土改中分得十亩六分田，本来每亩每季只能收二百斤左右，但经过他精耕细作，每亩收了三百五十多斤。
    劳动农民怎样一步一步向自然夺取更丰富的劳动果实，一步一步摆脱被自然界奴役的地位，农业生产力在各方面的进步情况，本书有了很好的叙述。太行山劳动英雄李顺达说：“过去人们不是不想把地种得现在这样好，但是那里来本钱呢？”土地改革就开始替农民准备了这种本钱，改进技术、改进农具、改进土壤、改进灌溉、改进种籽……所有这一切，不再是科学家在实验室里的闭门造车，而是广大农民孜孜不倦地进行研究的课题了。例如在平原省安阳等县，农民迫切要求改进技术，他们自动在地头地边划出土地来搞农业试验，在家里则到处摆满了供浸种试验的盆盆罐罐。
    荒地的开辟和耕地的增多是一个极大的成绩。翻身的农民从旧社会的束缚下解脱出来，就向“童山濯濯”顽强进攻。单在东北，一九四八年和一九四九年，共因开荒增加耕地一千四百七十余万亩，一九五○年春夏两季，又开辟了五百三十余万亩。
    东北和华北的农村生产水平，在经历过长期战争破坏之后，迅速地恢复到接近战前水平，若干地区并超过战前水平。这种恢复的速度比十月革命后苏联农业恢复的速度还要快。这虽然有种种的原因，但土地改革深刻地唤起了中国农民的无限劳动潜力，无疑的是一个最根本的原因。
    总的说来，本书对于学习土地改革问题和研究农村经济变化，都不失为一本材料丰富的好的参考书。
