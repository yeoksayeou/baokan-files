The Zhangjiakou Railway Factory Has Bureaucratic Work Style
	More Deployment, Less Inspection
　　Under the efforts of all employees, the Zhangjiakou Railway Factory overfulfilled its annual task last year. However, there are still serious bureaucratic work styles of only deploying and not inspecting in the leadership of the administration and the trade union. There are many such facts. For example, in early August last year, more than 100 young workers in the factory signed apprenticeship contracts with older technical workers and held a grand ceremony. In the initial period, it did play a certain role. However, it has been more than four months since that meeting, and none of the cadres has gone deep into the field to understand the problems between the masters and apprentices. According to the apprenticeship contract, apprentices who complete their studies ahead of schedule can be promoted and have their salaries increased; however, the contracts have now expired, and there has been no summary. When workers actively ask the trade union, they have not been resolved.
　　In order to protect the machines, the factory formulated a special responsibility system for machine maintenance. At that time, cards and wooden signs were made, with the names of the workers responsible for machine maintenance and the machine numbers written on them, and hung on the machines. The administration also established an inspection team, stipulating an inspection every three months, and decided to commend and reward those who maintained the machines well, and criticize or punish those who did not cherish the machines. Undoubtedly, this is a good system, and if resolutely implemented, it would be of great contribution to the people's enterprise. However, since the establishment of this system in October 1949, there has not been a single inspection, making the system a dead letter.
　　Last year, the factory launched several "accident-free" campaigns for ten or fifteen days. At the beginning, there were grand meetings and slogans were written, making it a lively event. However, when the movement ended, no one knew who had an accident or who had done a good job. Due to the bureaucratic work style of only deploying and not inspecting in the leadership, various systems and good methods cannot be sustained, and competitions cannot be carried out in depth. It is hoped that the factory leadership can seriously correct these shortcomings.

### 张家口铁路工厂有官僚主义作风  布置多检查少

　　张家口铁路工厂有官僚主义作风
　  布置多检查少
    张家口铁路工厂在全体员工的努力下，去年虽然超额完成全年任务；但行政和工会的领导上，还存在着严重的只布置不检查的官僚主义作风。这样的事实很多，如去年八月上旬，该厂有一百多名青工与年老的技术工人订立了师徒合同，并举行了隆重的仪式。在最初一个时期，确曾起了一定的作用。可是从那次会到现在已经四个多月了，干部们没有一个深入到现场去了解师徒之间的问题。根据师徒合同的规定，徒弟提前完成学习任务是可以升职加薪的；但现在订立合同的已经满期了，也没有总结。工友们主动去问工会，也未获得解决。
    该厂为了保护机器，曾订出保管机器的专责制度。当时并制出卡片和木牌，上面写明负责保管机器的工人的名字和机器号码，挂在机器上。行政上也曾成立检查组，规定三个月检查一次，对机器保养得好的，决定给予表扬和奖励；对不爱护机器的给予批评或处分。无疑地这是一种很好的制度，如果坚决执行，对人民的企业是有莫大贡献的。可是，自从一九四九年十月份订下这一制度到现在，连一次都没有检查过，使制度成了一纸空文。
    去年，该厂曾几次展开十天或十五天的无事故运动。开始时就开大会，写标语，搞得热火朝天。可是一到运动终了，谁出了事故，或者是谁工作的好，却没有人知道。由于领导上存在着这种只布置不检查的官僚主义作风，各种制度和好的办法不能坚持，竞赛也不能深入。对这种缺点，希望该厂领导上能认真地改正。
