　　Three Problems in Winter Schools Across Various Regions

　　Based on incomplete statistics from Northeast, Northwest, East China, Henan, Hubei, Pingyuan, and Hebei, the number of winter school students has reached over 5.2 million. Currently, the main problems existing in winter schools across various regions are: (1) Some leading cadres have insufficient understanding of the significance of winter schools, focusing only on central tasks in isolation and neglecting leadership over winter schools. (2) There is a lack of effective connection between cultural, current affairs, and production education. (3) A few winter schools still exhibit phenomena of apportionment and coercion in resolving funding and mobilizing enrollment.

　　Cultural and Educational Work Among Ethnic Minorities in Southwest China

　　Cultural and educational work among ethnic minorities in Southwest China is gradually unfolding with the vigorous assistance of local people's governments. Firstly, governments at all levels have cultivated their own teachers from ethnic minorities. Yunnan, Guizhou, and other regions have successively established teacher training classes for ethnic minorities. Secondly, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has allocated special funds this year to subsidize the insufficient cultural and educational funds for ethnic minorities in Southwest China. Currently, in order to further develop educational work among ethnic minorities, the Southwest region is actively preparing to establish national colleges in Chengdu, Guiyang, and Kunming respectively.

    各地冬学中的三个问题
    仅据东北、西北、华东、河南、湖北、平原、河北等地不完全统计，冬学学员已达五百二十余万人。目前，在各地冬学中存在的问题，主要是：（一）某些领导干部对冬学的意义认识不足，只是孤立地搞中心工作，忽视了对冬学的领导。（二）在进行文化、时事政治及生产教育时没有很好地进行适当的联系。（三）少数冬学在解决经费及动员入学时，还存在着摊派及强迫命令现象。
    西南少数民族的文教工作
    西南地区少数民族文化教育工作，在各地人民政府大力协助下，正逐步开展中。首先，各级政府培养了少数民族自己的师资。云南、贵州等地相继成立了少数民族师资训练班。其次中央人民政府教育部本年度拨出专款，补助西南少数民族文教经费的不足。目前西南区为了进一步开展少数民族教育工作，正积极筹备在成都、贵阳、昆明三市分别成立民族学院。
