Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: TASS, 7th dispatch: Pyongyang Radio broadcast a telegram from Pak Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to the United Nations and the people of the world, stating:

　　I, on the order of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and on behalf of the entire Korean people, protest to the United Nations, the people of the world, and world public opinion against the continued atrocities of the armed barbarians - the American imperialists - against the Korean people.

　　Eighty-two B-29 type aircraft raided Pyongyang at 12:10 pm on January 3rd of this year. Criminals and thugs in American uniforms but under the cover of the United Nations flag committed a premeditated crime - the massacre of peaceful residents of Pyongyang. These brutes dropped hundreds of tons of explosive and incendiary bombs, causing fires throughout the city. In order to prevent fire fighting, the American barbarians also dropped time bombs, which exploded all day in various parts of the city. The whole city was still burning the next day. 1,812 houses were burned down in just one day. The Americans know very well that there are no military targets in the city of Pyongyang. If the Americans consider factories, bridges and substations, civilian agencies, hospitals, schools and other larger buildings as military targets, all of these would have been destroyed by the American army and air force long ago. The small houses that escaped destruction are inhabited by civilians - homeless women, children and old people.

　　American barbarians have already massacred many innocent peaceful residents of Korea. But they are not satisfied. They have once again committed heinous crimes. Many civilians in Pyongyang were killed or injured by the bombing, burned to death or suffocated by smoke.

　　The people of the world know very well what the American imperialists, who are pursuing world hegemony, will do. The entire Korean people angrily protest the actions of the American aggressors who commit crimes and kill innocent civilians.

　　The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea informs the United Nations of the fact that the US Air Force has indiscriminately bombed Pyongyang, and resolutely demands that the United Nations take effective measures to stop the crimes of US imperialism. The United Nations should have ordered the US military to withdraw from Korea long ago and stop foreign armed intervention in the Korean people. If the United Nations cannot do this, then the peace-loving people of all countries with powerful strength will certainly be able to do so, because all of progressive humanity sympathizes with the Korean people and supports their struggle.

　　朝鲜外相朴宪永向联合国控诉
    要求制止美军野蛮滥炸罪行
    联合国如不能做到这点，那末具有强大力量的爱好和平的各国人民一定能够做到。
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社七日讯：平壤电台广播朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永致联合国与全世界人民的电报称：
    我奉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的命令并代表朝鲜全国人民，向联合国、全世界人民与世界舆论抗议武装的野蛮人——美帝国主义者继续对朝鲜人民逞凶的暴行。
    Ｂ——二九型飞机八十二架曾于今年一月三日十二时十分空袭平壤。穿着美国制服但却在联合国旗帜掩护下的罪犯和流氓，犯下了预谋的罪行——屠杀平壤的和平居民。这些暴徒投下了数百吨爆炸性和烧夷性的炸弹，使市内各区都起了大火。为了阻止救火起见，美国的野蛮人还投下了定时炸弹，整天在市内各区爆炸。直到第二天，全市还在燃烧。仅在一天之内就烧毁了一千八百一十二所房屋。美国人知道得很清楚，平壤城内没有军事目标。如果美国人认为工厂、桥梁和变电所、民用机关、医院、学校和其他较大的建筑物都是军事目标的话，所有这些早已就被美国的陆军和空军摧毁无遗了。那些幸免于毁灭的小房屋里面，住的都是平民——无处栖身的妇孺和老人。
    美国野蛮人已经屠杀了很多朝鲜无辜的和平居民。但他们还不满足。他们再次犯下了滔天罪行。平壤市内有很多平民都被炸死或炸伤，烧死或被烟闷死。
    全世界人民知道得很清楚，追求世界霸权的美帝国主义者会干出什么事情来。朝鲜全国人民愤怒地抗议那些犯罪和残杀无辜平民的美国侵略者的行动。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府将美国空军滥炸平壤的事实通知联合国，坚决要求联合国采取有效的措施，制止美帝的罪行。联合国早就应该叫美军自朝鲜撤退，制止外国对朝鲜人民的武装干涉。如果联合国不能做到这一点，那末具有强大力量的爱好和平的各国人民一定能够做到，因为整个进步人类都同情朝鲜人民，并且支持他们的斗争。
