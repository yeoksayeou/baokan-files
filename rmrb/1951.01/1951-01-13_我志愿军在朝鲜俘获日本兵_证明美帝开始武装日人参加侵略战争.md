Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: A reporter accompanying the Chinese People's Volunteer Army reports: Our People's Volunteer Army has captured Japanese soldiers on the Korean battlefield, proving that MacArthur has begun to arm Japanese to participate in the war of aggression. This completely violates the Potsdam Declaration regarding the disarmament of the Japanese army. The reporter saw the captured Japanese reconnaissance soldier, Taniyama Yoshio, who served in a reconnaissance team of the 3rd Engineer Battalion of the U.S. 24th Division. He was captured on November 23rd of last year when the reconnaissance team was annihilated near the Internal Affairs Office of Yonggye-myeon (myeon meaning district), northwest of Bochuan in northwestern Korea. Taniyama Yoshio is from Tokyo, Japan, and his family lives at 533 Nishicho, Kita-ku, Tokyo. His brother, Taniyama Yoshimitsu, and sister-in-law, Tanaka Masako, still live there and operate the "Taniyama Automobile Repair Factory." He was recruited into the U.S. Army as a reconnaissance soldier in April 1949 by the "Military Administration Job Placement Office" jointly established by MacArthur and the Yoshida government. He landed in Busan with the aforementioned engineer battalion in June of last year and participated in the Korean War. Major cities in Japan have "Military Administration Job Placement Offices." The one that introduced Taniyama into the army was located at 26, lower floor of the Municipal Building, 2-chome, Yoshino-cho, Nagasaki City. Taniyama confessed that there were many Japanese in the U.S. Army invading Korea. He said: "On November 23rd, I was traveling with the reconnaissance team leader, Lieutenant Han Steen, and others in a jeep towards Taecheon for reconnaissance. When we passed through Bochuan, I personally saw about a battalion of infantry from the 19th Regiment of the U.S. 24th Division advancing. Many of them were Japanese soldiers, and they all spoke Japanese." (Attached picture)

　　我志愿军在朝鲜俘获日本兵
    证明美帝开始武装日人参加侵略战争
    【新华社十二日讯】本社随中国人民志愿军记者报道：我人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上俘获了日本兵，证明麦克阿瑟已开始武装日本人参加侵略战争，这完全违反了波茨坦公告关于解除日军武装的规定。记者见到的是被俘的日籍侦察兵谷山义男，服役于美军第二十四师第三工兵营的一个侦察队，于去年十一月二十三日该侦察队在朝鲜西北部博川西北龙溪面（面即区）内务署附近受歼时被俘。谷山义男为日本东京人，家住都北区西町五三三番地，兄谷山义光，嫂田中正子，现仍在该处居住，并开设有“谷山自动车修理工场”。他是在一九四九年四月由麦克阿瑟与吉田政府共同设立的“军政职业介绍所”招募到美军去当侦察兵，并于去年六月随同上述工兵大队在釜山登陆，参加朝鲜战争。日本各大城市均有“军政职业介绍所”，介绍谷山入伍的是设在长崎市吉野町二丁目市政内下阶二十六号的一个。谷山供认：在侵朝美军中有不少日本人，他说：“十一月二十三日，我随同侦察队长上尉汉·斯汀等坐吉普车向泰川方面侦察时，途经博川，曾亲眼看见美军第二十四师团第十九团约一个营的步兵正在前进，其中有许多日本士兵，他们都用日语讲话”。（附图片）
