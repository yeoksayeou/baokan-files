　　Changchun Railway Bureau Thanks the Masses for Criticism, Corrects Unhealthy Tendencies at Shuangchengbao Station

　　Editor's Note: Comrades Li Weicheng and Mo Hou of a PLA unit stationed in Tianjin sent a letter to this newspaper, criticizing the Shuangchengbao Station personnel for irresponsibility and creating difficulties for passengers. After this newspaper forwarded the opinion to the Changchun Railway Bureau, the bureau immediately conducted an investigation and corrected this bureaucratic and unhealthy work style, giving the personnel involved due punishment. We believe that this style of valuing mass opinions, earnestly accepting criticism, and improving work is worthy of emulation by all localities. The reply letter from Zhang Xueke, Assistant Director of the Changchun Railway Bureau, is published below:

To Comrades Li Weicheng and Mo Hou of a PLA unit stationed in Tianjin, via the Reader's Letters Group of the People's Daily:

    The Ministry of Railways forwarded your opinions regarding the undesirable work style existing at Shuangchengbao Station. Our bureau has completed its investigation. In addition to expressing our gratitude for your genuine enthusiasm as masters of the country, caring for the people's railway work, before informing you of the handling of this matter, I, as the highest responsible person of the Administration, would like to offer my apologies on the following two points:

    First, due to the roundabout mailing of the letter and the time spent in investigation and understanding, much time was delayed, and we were unable to reply to you promptly.

    Second, our on-site work inspection was not thorough enough, resulting in such serious shortcomings in the work not being discovered and corrected earlier.

    After receiving your opinion, we immediately dispatched cadres to the station to conduct an investigation and understanding, and the Party, Youth League, and labor union organizations held meetings for self-criticism. The results obtained were largely in agreement with what you mentioned in your letter. In order to correct this unhealthy work style and implement the idea of serving the people, Gao Chunqing, the ticket inspector who was irresponsible in his work and created difficulties for passengers, exhibiting a serious bureaucratic work style, was given a major demerit. Ticket seller Gao Diange failed to highly promote the spirit of supporting the army and cherishing the government, disregarded the call of the higher authorities, and failed to promptly correct the mistakes of his comrades. Stationmaster Zhao Zongheng did not pay enough attention to passenger transport work, and his leadership inspection was not thorough enough, and each was given criticism. This fact was also published in the Northeast Railway's newspaper "Locomotive" as study material for all on-site passenger transport employees throughout the bureau, to eliminate the bureaucratic work style that still remains in the work of various employees.

    In order to run the people's railway well, we rely heavily on mass supervision and assistance. We not only hope that you will frequently provide valuable opinions based on what you see and hear during your travels in the future, but also ask you to spread this spirit of being responsible for your own railway to the broad masses, and to offer opinions anytime and anywhere so that we can correct the shortcomings in our work that have not been discovered as soon as possible. With respectful greetings,

                                 Zhang Xueke, Assistant Director of the Changchun Railway Bureau

　　中长铁路局感谢群众批评  纠正双城堡车站不良作风
    编者按：天津市驻军某部李维城、莫后两同志曾致函本报，对双城堡车站人员工作不负责任、留难旅客等缺点提出批评。本报将这个意见转告中长铁路管理局后，该局当即进行调查，并对此种官僚主义的不良作风进行纠正，给予有关人员以应得处分。我们认为：此种重视群众意见，认真接受批评，改进工作的作风，值得各地学习。现将中长铁路管理局助理局长张学轲同志的复信发表如下：
                                                 人民日报读者来信组转天津市驻军某部李维城、莫后两同志：
    铁道部转来你们对双城堡车站在工作上存在的不良作风所提意见，我局已调查完竣。除对你真正以主人立场，关心人民铁路工作的热忱，表示谢意外，在告诉对这件事处理经过以前我以管理局最高负责人的资格，对左列两点向你致歉：
    一、因为函件辗转寄递，和在调查了解过程中，耽搁了很多时间，未能及时向你回答。
    二、对现地工作检查不够深入，致令像这样在工作上存在着的严重缺点，未能及早发见加以纠正。
    收到你的意见后，即派干部至该站进行调查了解，并由党团工组织群众开会检讨，所得结果，与你函所提无大出入。为纠正此种不良作风，贯彻为人民服务思想，对该站工作不负责任，留难旅客等，在工作上表现着严重官僚作风的检票员高春庆，予以记大过一次。售票员高殿阁，未能高度发挥拥军拥政精神，漠视上级的号召，并不能及时的纠正同志错误；站长赵宗亨，不重视客运工作，领导检查不够周到，各予批评。并将此一事实，于东北铁路的机关报《火车头》报公布，作为全局现地客运员工的学习资料，用以肃清现仍残存在各员工工作上的官僚作风。
    为了办好人民铁路，仰赖于群众监督援助的地方很多。不仅希望你今后在旅行中时常以所见所闻提供宝贵意见，并请你将这种对自己铁路负责的精神，传播到广大群众中去，随时随地提出意见，以便将我们在工作上未能发见的缺点及早纠正。此致敬礼
                                中长铁路管理局助理局长  张学轲
