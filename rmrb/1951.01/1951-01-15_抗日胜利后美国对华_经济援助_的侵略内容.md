The US imperialist loans to Chiang Kai-shek during the Anti-Japanese War were analyzed in my article "The Aggressive Content of US Economic Aid to China During the Anti-Japanese War." According to Austin's admission at the United Nations Security Council, after the victory against Japan, US imperialist aid to Chiang Kai-shek, excluding Lend-Lease and military aid, totaled US$1 billion. If Lend-Lease and military aid are included, the amount would be four or five times larger. Austin brought out this old account of "economic aid to China" to illustrate the "friendship" of the United States towards China, hoping to create some deception among the American and Chinese people. He deliberately excluded Lend-Lease and military aid from his "economic aid" figure because it was obvious that the military supplies and other military aid shipped to China under Lend-Lease after Japan's surrender were directly used to help Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war. Could providing weapons to slaughter the Chinese people be considered an expression of friendship towards the Chinese people? Even Austin, who is accustomed to distorting right and wrong, felt that such a statement would be too absurd, so he avoided talking about Lend-Lease aid and military assistance. However, what about the US$1 billion in economic aid that he specifically mentioned? According to the materials in the White Paper, this US$1 billion roughly includes the following "loans" and "grants":

    A. Loans                  (Unit: Million US Dollars)
    (1) Lend-Lease "Takeover" Loans              51.7
    (2) Export-Import Bank Loans                  82.8
    (3) Civil Surplus Property Transfer Arrears            55.0
    (4) Arrears for Purchasing Ships from the Maritime Commission        16.4
    Total Loans                            205.9
    B. Grants
    (1) US Contribution to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's China Program   474.0
    (2) US Share of the UNRRA Donation to the CNRRA      3.6
    (3) US Foreign Relief Program                        46.4
    (4) Economic Cooperation Administration Grants                      275.0
    Total Grants                                    799.0
    Total "Aid"                        1,003.4

From the table above, it can be seen that the main form of US aid during this period was conditional grants rather than loans. The amount of loans was very small. The Lend-Lease "takeover" loan was a continuation of the unused civilian supplies portion of the Lend-Lease during the Anti-Japanese War. The Export-Import Bank loans were decided in 1945 and 1946, including funds for purchasing cotton, railway and coal mining equipment, ships, and the outstanding 16 million Yongli Chemical Company loan. The arrears for the transfer of civilian surplus materials were based on the August 30, 1946 agreement, which actually purchased many unusable and even useless surplus waste materials. The arrears for purchasing ships from the Maritime Commission were unpaid funds for 43 ships purchased under the 1946 Merchant Ship Sales Act (the total purchase price was US$26.2 million, of which US$9.8 million was paid in cash). By calculating account by account like this, we can see that the loans were all before 1946. At that time, the signs of the Kuomintang government's collapse were not yet very obvious. Marshall was still helping Chiang Kai-shek oppose the Chinese people through "mediation," so he only used loans to support the Chiang group's economy. After 1947, Marshall returned home after his failure, the Chiang bandit regime became increasingly weakened, and the economic crisis rapidly deepened. Seeing that it was about to collapse, the US imperialists adopted the method of conditionally donating "relief supplies," thereby further controlling the economy of Kuomintang China and attempting to buy people's hearts to save the dying situation.

Items (1) and (2) under the "Grants" heading in the table above are aid from the international organization United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Although this organization was established quite early, most of the supplies only arrived in China in 1947. According to the principle of implementing post-war relief by the organization, relief supplies should be distributed according to the war zone area and the actual war damage and losses suffered by the people, and political discrimination should not be allowed. However, in the liberated areas of China, which suffered the most from the war and suffered the most from the enemy's "three alls policy," the disaster victims numbered 26 million, accounting for five-thirds of the 42 million disaster victims nationwide at that time, and should have received five-thirds of the "relief supplies"; however, under the manipulation of the US imperialists, UNRRA only allocated less than 2% of the supplies to the liberated areas. This historical fact of the distribution of supplies in China by UNRRA can prove that the so-called purpose of relief is not relief but deception of the people. Therefore, the gentlemen who were in charge of distributing materials under the command of the US imperialists in UNRRA and CNRRA tried every possible means to prevent relief supplies from being sent to the Chinese liberated areas where deceptive tactics were not easy to work.

The negotiation of the United States directly donating relief supplies began in 1947. On February 4 of that year, Song Ziwen submitted a request for economic aid to the US Ambassador to China, Stuart, saying: "Only some concrete forms of American aid and support can stabilize China's economy and improve China's (referring to the Kuomintang government) political future." According to the White Paper, the documents exchanged between the US Ambassador to China and the State Department to discuss aid to China, as well as the minutes of discussions between the State Department and Congress on this matter, repeatedly prove that the purpose of the US government's consideration of economic aid to China was how to support the increasingly collapsing economy of the Chiang-controlled areas and how to strengthen the increasingly weakened Kuomintang regime, in order to achieve its attempt to eliminate the people's forces and further turn China into a US colony. The reason why the US imperialists were hesitant, repeatedly delayed and reduced the amount of aid grants was that they were worried that the Chiang government was too corrupt and incompetent to effectively utilize the US imperialists' grants to achieve their desired goals. Moreover, when discussing grants in 1947, the Chiang government still had a large amount of foreign exchange in banks, and the above-mentioned loans, such as the "oil pipeline" loan, the surplus materials loan, and the Canadian US$60 million loan, were only partially utilized. Therefore, purely from the perspective of economic needs, there was no need to provide grants. However, the main consideration for this type of grant from the US imperialists was not the needs of the Chinese economy but the political needs of the US imperialist policy of aggression. On this point, the White Paper makes it clear: "During this period (referring to after Japan's surrender), although the Chinese government has obtained a large number of foreign resources, including China's own and foreign loans and purchasing power, the State Department still believes that if additional aid is provided, it may considerably strengthen the Chinese people's confidence in the National Government and enable the government to obtain the support of various minority parties." In other words, it was to buy people's hearts for the Chiang regime, and at the same time, it was to buy people's hearts for the US imperialists.

Therefore, in 1947, a total of US$46.4 million was allocated from the US Foreign Relief Program funds to the Kuomintang government. Although the amount of money was not large, the US imperialists could use this opportunity to sign an agreement with the Kuomintang government that was very beneficial to the US imperialists, called the "Sino-American Agreement on US Relief Assistance to the Chinese People" (hereinafter referred to as the Relief Agreement). Article 8 of this agreement fully exposes the US imperialists' attempt to "buy people's hearts." Item A of this article stipulates that the "Chinese government" must "arrange full and continued publicity" for US aid. Item B of this article more specifically stipulates the methods of publicity as follows: "All American relief supplies and any items made from such supplies or the containers of such supplies or items shall, as far as possible, be marked, stamped, branded, or labeled in a conspicuous place so that the final consumer may know that such supplies or items are provided by the United States of America for relief assistance. If such supplies, items, or containers cannot be so marked, stamped, branded, or labeled, the Chinese government shall take all feasible steps to notify the final consumer that such supplies or items are provided by the United States for relief assistance." The US imperialists' emphasis on relief publicity is very obvious. In the eyes of the US imperialists, "relief" is a weapon for implementing anti-communist and aggressive policies!

In addition to the attempt to "buy people's hearts," the US imperialists also used "relief" to establish an organization in China, on the one hand, to interfere in China's economic policies by exercising the power to supervise and manage relief supplies, and on the other hand, to collect intelligence through the relief organization. First, let's talk about the first point. Item A of Article 3 of the "Relief Agreement" stipulates that "the price at which American relief supplies are sold in China shall be agreed upon by the Chinese government and the US government." The US imperialists can use this article to ship certain commodities in the name of relief and lower the price of such commodities, thereby defeating the competition between Chinese national industrial products and US imperialist products in the Chinese market.

The work of collecting intelligence is also very specifically stipulated in the "Relief Agreement." Article 5 of the agreement stipulates that the United States may send representatives to reside in China to fulfill the "Relief Agreement" and stipulates that the "Chinese government" shall grant US representatives "permission and convenience to travel within China." Item B of this article stipulates that "the Chinese government shall permit US representatives to have freedom to monitor the distribution of US relief supplies, as well as to travel, inspect, and report on any matters related to this agreement, and shall provide convenience in all aspects;... the Chinese government will provide necessary automobile transportation so that US representatives can travel freely throughout China without delay." This really opened all the doors of China's domestic areas, and US representatives could enter and exit at will to carry out any "investigation and research" work needed by the US imperialists. But that's not all! Item B of Article 7 of the agreement has even more serious stipulations. According to this item, "the Chinese government shall, at the request of US representatives, promptly supply existing information regarding the production, use, distribution, import, and export of any materials that may affect the relief needs of the people." We can know with a little thought how broad this item includes! Economic things are closely related, and the so-called "any materials that may affect the relief needs of the people" can be interpreted to include all materials! This is not only giving "investigators" from the US imperialists convenience, as stipulated in Article 5 of the agreement, but also actively providing all the information about the Chinese economy that the US imperialists need. With this provision, anything that US imperialist spies cannot investigate can be ordered to be "promptly supplied" by the Kuomintang's lackeys!

However, the privileges obtained by the US imperialists in this relief agreement are just the beginning. By the time the "Sino-American Bilateral Economic Aid Agreement" (hereinafter referred to as the Bilateral Agreement) was signed in the summer of 1948, it can be seen that the US imperialists were taking a step forward to use relief methods to carry out a comprehensive attempt at economic aggression. According to this agreement, the US imperialists allocated US$275 million to the Kuomintang government (and also allocated US$125 million in military spending to the Chiang bandits, which was purely to subsidize the civil war and the killing of the Chinese people).

This Bilateral Agreement can be said to be an expanded and revised version of the 1947 Relief Agreement. It more detailedly and specifically states the terms already stipulated in the Relief Agreement that the price of US aid supplies must be agreed upon with the US, that the US must be provided with the Chinese economic intelligence it needs, and that full publicity must be given to US aid. In addition, many more important new conditions have been added. The preamble to the agreement points out that the purpose of the agreement is to assist the Kuomintang government in promoting the so-called "self-help plan" and to improve "business relations" between China and the United States. This is the aggressive method commonly used by US imperialism in the Marshall Plan. The White Paper openly admits that the US formulation of the content of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement is in line with the various clauses stipulated in the first item of the 1948 Economic Cooperation Act for assisting countries participating in the European Economic Cooperation Organization (i.e., the so-called Marshall Plan countries). However, because "the situation in China and Western Europe is different," the conditions for China are even harsher than those for European countries, so the Bilateral Agreement can be said to be a Marshall Plan with added ingredients.

The topic of assisting China in "promoting a self-help plan" in the Bilateral Agreement is obviously an excuse created by the US imperialists to further tighten their control over the economic policies of Kuomintang China. Article 2 of the agreement stipulates: "The Chinese government (Kuomintang government) undertakes to take or maintain necessary measures to ensure the effective and practical use of its available economic resources." This includes the development of industrial and agricultural production, currency system, transportation, domestic and foreign trade measures, as well as the use of Chinese people's assets abroad and US aid supplies, almost including all economic policies! If it is really a self-help measure for China, why should it be written in an international agreement? It is clear that it is because the US imperialists want China to implement the measures stipulated according to the will of the US imperialists, so this article is listed in the agreement. The US imperialists call it the "self-help plan," which is completely to deceive the Chinese people. The White Paper frankly admits: "The State Department has considered making China make more definite commitments in the bilateral aid agreement,... but it was subsequently decided to use an informal form to advise the Chinese government to take concrete measures as soon as possible to fulfill the general commitments included in the aid agreement. Therefore, the embassy in China was ordered to hold a series of informal discussions with Chinese government leaders... The State Department indicated that the consultations should force China to provide verbal guarantees for the specific measures referred to." Based on this decision, the US ambassador in Nanjing presented a series of "special economic measures" to the Kuomintang government. The measures include eight items: government expenditure, government revenue, civil administration and military administration, distribution of important commodities, banks and loans, agricultural improvement, foreign trade and its control, and encouragement of private enterprises. This greatly opens the door for the US government to fully interfere in the Chinese economy! What a "promotion of China's self-help plan"!

It can be seen from this that Article 2 of the Bilateral Agreement is a general provision; according to this general provision, the US imperialists can use the excuse of "promoting China's self-help" to propose any measures at any time to "force China to make verbal guarantees." In addition, the Bilateral Agreement also includes many specific conditions related to business and strategic materials, counterpart funds, and implementing agencies.

Regarding business issues, Article 3 of the Bilateral Agreement actually transfers the power to decide China's foreign trade policy to US imperialism. According to this article, the Kuomintang government undertakes to improve its business relations with other countries, especially to improve "the situation of private enterprises in China engaged in foreign trade." Obviously, this is speaking for foreign merchants in China. The most important thing is the third item of this article: "The Chinese government and the government of the United States of America shall, upon the application of either party, consult on any matter in the application of the provisions of this article." This provision actually gives American businessmen in China the freedom to do whatever they want in the Chinese market!

Article 6, Item 1 of the Bilateral Agreement, specifically stipulates that "the Chinese government shall facilitate the transfer to the United States of America of materials produced in China that the United States of America needs because of a lack or possible lack of such materials in its national resources, whether for storage or other purposes...". Article 8, Item 3 of the agreement also stipulates that the Kuomintang government must provide the US imperialists with "necessary information" regarding these materials. The materials referred to in the article are mainly mineral products such as tungsten, antimony, and tin, which are important strategic materials for heavy industry that are unique to China. As mentioned earlier, during the Anti-Japanese War, the United States had already seized the opportunity of loans to control a part of these materials. In the Bilateral Agreement, this attempt has developed into a general provision. In this way, the United States has obtained the priority to purchase China's strategic materials. At the same time, the article also stipulates that "the Chinese government will take the necessary specific measures to implement the provisions of this item," and declares that "negotiations will begin soon on the detailed methods necessary to implement the provisions of this item." The so-called detailed methods are of course measures regarding the production and sales of strategic materials. This provision hands over all sovereignty over these strategic materials to the US imperialists.

The Bilateral Agreement also includes a typical Marshall Plan condition, the so-called counterpart fund. According to this condition, the Chiang bandit government must deposit Jiang currency equal to the value of the US aid supplies donated by the US imperialists and the remaining funds in the special account of the 1947 Relief Agreement mentioned above into a special account of the puppet Central Bank. Article 5, Item 5 of the agreement clearly stipulates that in addition to the uses already stipulated in the agreement, the "any balance" of the deposit in this account can only be "disposed of by the Jiang government for the purposes agreed upon by it and the government of the United States of America at any time." This counterpart fund actually gives the US imperialists a great economic power. We only need to recall the British Angell, the Chief Tax Inspector of the Beiyang government. At that time, he actually became the "Supreme Emperor" of the Beiyang government by using a sum of money that controlled the so-called "customs surplus." The power that the US imperialists gained in the Bilateral Agreement to control China's financial finance and economy is far greater than the mere "customs surplus." Its power over China during the Chiang bandit era can be imagined.

In addition, the US imperialists also used the opportunity of relief to undermine the integrity of China's judicial power. Article 11 of the Bilateral Agreement stipulates that when any measures by the Chinese side affect the "property or interests of the people" of the United States, the Americans have the right to submit them to the International Court of Justice of the United Nations controlled by the United States. Or any arbitration tribunal agreed upon by both parties shall judge or resolve.

In order to implement the Bilateral Agreement, the United States sent a Special Representative for Economic Cooperation stationed in China to directly supervise, and organized a China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration under the leadership of the Special Representative. This agency dispatched representatives and staff with diplomatic privileges throughout major cities and other economic hubs across the country. It not only fully controlled the disposal of 375 million US dollars worth of materials, but also, through the so-called "counterpart fund" method, controlled the use of Chinese currency deposits equal to the value of US aid materials! When the Bilateral Agreement was signed in China on July 3, 1948, the Chinese reactionary regime that it wanted to use and support was on its last leg, on the eve of its collapse. The US imperialists also knew that its lifespan was not long, so they only set a one-year deadline. The White Paper reveals: "The State Department views the aid to China program either as the beginning of more... efforts in the future, or as the end of large-scale aid to China." This prediction is correct. Less than half a year after the implementation of the Bilateral Agreement, the Chinese People's Liberation Army swept the country, and the US imperialists' insidious Bilateral Agreement and all its economic aggression measures completely died out on the Chinese mainland with the collapse of the Chiang regime! What is left is only the tragic obituary-style historical narrative in the White Paper and the weak and shameless call of memory in Austin's mouth!

　　抗日胜利后美国对华“经济援助”的侵略内容
    超定
    抗战期间美帝援蒋贷款，我在“抗战时期美国对华经济援助的侵略内容”一文中，已加以分析。抗日胜利后，美帝援蒋物资及贷款，据奥斯汀在联合国安理会所招认的，除了租借法及军事援助之外，共十亿美元。如果把租借法及军事援助算进去那便四五倍于此数了。奥斯汀搬出这本“经济援华”的旧账，其用意是要借此说明美国对中国的“友谊”，谋在美国人民及中国人民中起一些欺骗作用。他故意不把租借法及军事援助包括在他“经济援助”的数字里头，因为很明显的，日本投降后的租借法下运华的军用物资及其他军事援助是用来直接帮助蒋介石打内战的。难道供给军火残杀中国人民，还能说是对中国人民友谊的表现么？奥斯汀虽是惯于颠倒是非的人，也觉得这句话说出来太不像话了，所以避开租借法援助及军事援助不敢谈。然而他所特别提出来的那十亿元经济援助又怎样呢？根据白皮书的材料，这十亿元大概包括以下的各种“贷款”及“赠款”：
    甲、贷款                  （单位：美金百万元）
    （１）租借法“接管”贷款              五一·七
    （２）进出口银行贷款                  八二·八
    （３）民用剩余物资移转欠款            五五·○
    （４）向海事委员会购买船只欠款        一六·四
    贷款总数                            二○五·九
    乙、赠款
    （１）联合国救济总署中国方案中之美国捐助部分   四七四·○
    （２）联总给予善后事业保管委员会捐助中之美国分担部分      三·六
    （３）美国对外救济方案                        四六·四
    （４）经济合作总署赠送                      二七五·○
    赠送总数                                    七九九·○
    两项“援助”总数                        一、○○三·四
    由上表可以看出这个时期美援的主要方式是有条件的赠款而不是贷款。属于贷款部分的数量是很少的。租借法“接管”贷款是继续抗战时期租借法未取用的民用物资部分。进出口银行贷款都是一九四五及一九四六年决定的包括购买棉花，铁路及煤矿器材，船舶的款项以及尚未支付的一千六百万永利化学公司借款。民用剩余物资移转欠款是根据一九四六年八月三十日协定，实际上买下了很多不适用甚至无用的剩余废物。向海事委员会购买船舶欠款是根据一九四六年商船出售法所购四十三条船未付之款（总购价为二千六百二十万美元，其中九百八十万美元是付了现款的）。这样的逐笔算算账，我们便可以看出贷款都在一九四六年以前。那时国民党政府的崩溃迹象还不十分明显。马歇尔还正在以“调处”的方式帮助蒋介石反对中国人民，所以只用了贷款的方式支持蒋集团的经济。一九四七年以后，马歇尔失败归国，蒋匪的政权日趋削弱，经济危机迅速加深，看看是要垮台了，美帝乃采用有条件的赠送“救济物资”的方式，借此更进一步控制国民党中国的经济并企图收买人心以挽回将死的局面。
    上表“赠款”项中（１）及（２）是国际机构联合国救济总署的援助。这个机构虽然建立颇早，大部的物资是一九四七年才运达中国，根据该机构实施战后救济的原则，是应按照战区地域及人民实际遭受战争破坏及损失而分配救济物资，决不允许有政治上的歧视待遇。但是，在中国受战争损失最大遭敌人“三光政策”受灾最重的解放区，灾民有二千六百万，占当时全国灾民四千二百万的五分之三，应得“救济物资”的五分之三；可是在美帝操纵之下，联总只分配给解放区百分之二弱的物资。即就这一点来说，联总在华分配物资的历史事实便可以证明所谓救济的目的，不是救济而是欺骗人民。所以，在美帝指挥下的联总及华总的执行分配物资的先生们，便千方百计的阻止把救济物资送往欺骗手段不易起作用的中国解放区。
    美国直接出面赠送救济物资的交涉是一九四七年开始的。该年二月四日宋子文向美国驻华大使司徒雷登提出经济援助的请求。内容说：“只有一些具体形式的美援和支持才能稳定中国的经济及改进中国（指国民党政府）的政治前途”。据白皮书所载美国驻华大使与国务院讨论援华办法的来往文件以及国务院与国会商讨这件事的意见书会谈记录等，都一再的证明，美国政府考虑经济援华的目的，是如何支持日趋崩溃的蒋管区经济，如何加强日益削弱的国民党政权，以达到其消灭人民力量进一步把中国变为美国殖民地的企图。美帝所以迟迟未决，一再拖延及削减援华赠款的原因，是顾虑蒋政府太腐化无能，不能有效的利用美帝的赠款以达到他们所期望的目的。况且在一九四七年商讨赠款的时候，蒋政府尚有大量外汇存在银行，而上述的各种借款如“油管”借款，剩余物资借款以及加拿大的六千万美元借款，尚止部分的动用。所以纯就经济的需要考虑是没有再给与赠款的必要的。但是美帝这种赠款主要的考虑不是中国经济的需要而是美帝侵略政策政治上的需要。关于这一点，白皮书上说得清楚：“在此时期中（按指日本投降后）中国政府虽已取得大量之国外资源包括中国自身及外国借与之购买力，国务院仍然认为，如再与以额外之援助或可相当的加强中国人民对国民政府之信心，并可使该政府获得各少数党之支持。”换句话说，是替蒋政权收买人心，同时也就是替美帝收买人心。
    因此，在一九四七年先后由美国对外救济方案的款项中拨出共四千六百万美元赠与国民党政府。款子的数目虽不大，美帝却可利用这个机会与国民党政府签订了一个十分有利于美帝的协定，叫做“中美关于美国救济协助中国人民之协定”（以后简称救济协定）。这协定里第八条便全盘的暴露出来美帝“收买人心”的企图。该条甲项规定“中国政府”对美国的援助须“安排充分与继续之宣传”。该条乙项更具体的规定宣传的方法如下：“所有美国救济物资及由此项物资制成之任何物品或此项物资或物品之容器，应尽量于显著部位予以标记，戳记，烙印或贴签，俾使最后消费者获悉此项物资或物品系由美利坚合众国为救济援助而供给者。若此项物资物品或容器不能如此予以标记，戳记，烙印或贴签时，则中国政府将采取一切可行之步骤，通知最后消费者，此项物资或物品系由美国为救济援助而供给者。”美帝这样注重救济宣传的用意是很明显的，在美帝心目中“救济”是执行反共和侵略政策的一种武器！
    除“收买人心”的企图以外，美帝还利用“救济”在中国建立了一个机构，一方面借监督及管理救济物资之权而干涉中国的经济政策，一方面透过救济的机构进行情报的收集。先说第一点。“救济协定”第三条甲项规定“美国救济物资在中国出售之价格，应由中国政府与美国政府商定之”。美帝可以运用此条，以救济为名运来某些商品，压低这种商品的价格，由此打倒中国民族工业产品与美帝产品在中国市场上的竞争。
    关于收集情报的工作，“救济协定”里也是很具体的规定了的。协定第五条规定美国可派遣代表驻在中国，以履行“救济协定”并规定“中国政府”予美国代表“在中国境内旅行之准许及便利”。该条乙项规定“中国政府准许美国代表有监察美国救济物资之分配，以及旅行，视察及报导与本协定任何有关事项之自由，并于各方面予以便利；……中国政府将供给必要之汽车运输，使美国代表得在中国全境自由旅行而无延滞”。这真是把中国的国内各处的大门全都打开，美国代表可以任意出入，进行美帝所需要的任何“调查研究”工作了。但是还不止此！该协定的第七条乙项还有更利害的规定。根据这一项，“中国政府依美国代表之请求，将迅速供给关于足以影响人民救济需要之任何物资之生产，使用，分配，输入及输出之现有情报”。我们略一思索便知道这项包括之广了！经济的东西都是密切相关的，所谓“足以影响人民救济需要之任何物资”可以解释成包括一切物资！这样便不止是给美帝“调查员”以便利，如协定第五条所规定，而是积极的供给美帝所需要的一切有关中国经济的资料。既有此规定，美帝自己的谍报员所调查不到的东西，就可以命令国民党的走狗们“从速供给”了！
    但是美帝在这个救济协定里所取得的特权还不过是一个开端。到了一九四八年夏所签订的“中美双边经济援助协定”（以后简称双边协定）那便可以看出美帝迈步前进运用救济的手法进行经济侵略的全面企图了。根据这个协定，美帝拨给国民党政府二亿七千五百万美元（同时还拨给蒋匪一亿二千五百万美元的军费，纯系为补助打内战残杀中国人民的费用）。
    这个双边协定可以说是一九四七年救济协定的扩大增订版。其中更详细的具体的写明救济协定中所已规定的必须与美方商定美援物资出售的价格，必须供给美方所需中国经济情报及必须给予美援充分的宣传等条款。此外并增加了很多更重要的新的条件。该协定的约首便指出协定的目的是为协助国民党政府推行所谓“自助计划”并改善中国与美国间之“商务关系”。这是美帝国主义在马歇尔计划中所惯用的侵略方式。白皮书中公开的承认，美国对中美双边协定的内容之拟订是与一九四八年经济合作法案第一目中规定援助参加欧洲经济合作组织国家（即所谓马歇尔计划国家）之各条款力求符合的。但因“中国与西欧情势不同”故对中国条件更较欧洲各国为苛刻，所以双边协定可以说是一种加料的马歇尔计划。
    双边协定中所谓协助中国“推行自助计划”的题目很显然的是美帝为了进一步加紧控制国民党中国的经济政策所制造的借口。协定第二条规定：“中国政府（国民党政府）承允采取或维持必要措施，以保证有效及切实使用其可利用之经济资源。”这里包括工农业生产之发展，币制，运输，对内对外贸易之措施，以及中国人民在外资产及美援物资之使用，差不多包括全部的经济政策！如果真是中国自助的措施，为什么要写在国际协定里呢？明明是因为美帝要中国执行根据美帝意志所规定的措施，所以才在协定里列了此条，美帝把他叫做“自助计划”，完全是为欺骗中国人民的。白皮书中坦白的招认：“国务院曾考虑于双边援助协定中，使中国作更确定之承诺，……但嗣后决定用非正式形式，劝中国政府及早采取具体办法，以履行包括于援助协定中之一般承诺。因此驻华大使馆奉令与中国政府领袖举行一连串之非正式商讨……国务院表示，商讨时应迫中国对所指特别办法作口头之担保。”根据这个决定，美国驻南京大使向国民党政府提出了一连串的“特别经济办法”。该办法包括政府开支，政府收入，民政及军政，重要商品之分配，银行与贷款，农业之改进，对外贸易及其统制，鼓励私人企业等八个项目。这样大开了美国政府全盘干涉中国经济之门！好一个“推行中国的自助计划”！
    由此可见双边协定的第二条是一个总的规定；根据这个总的规定，美帝可以拿“推进中国自助”为借口随时提出任何办法“逼使中国作口头之担保”。此外双边协定里还包括很多有关商务及战略物资，对等基金，执行机构等问题的具体条件。
    关于商务问题，双边协定第三条实际把中国的对外贸易政策的决定权让给了美帝国主义。根据这条，国民党政府承允改善与他国间之商务关系，尤其是改善“中国境内私人企业经营对外贸易之情况”。很明显，这是为在中国的洋商说话的。最重要的是本条第三项：“中国政府与美利坚合众国政府，经任何一方之申请，将协商关于本条各规定适用上之任何事项”。这条规定实际上给了美国商人在中国市场上为所欲为，横行无忌的自由！
    双边协定的第六条第一项，具体的规定“中国政府对美利坚合众国因其本国资源中缺乏或可能缺乏而需要之中国所产物资移转于美利坚合众国，无论是为储备或其他目的，将予以便利……”。该协定第八条第三项并规定国民党政府须向美帝供给关于此项物资“所必要的情报”。条文中指的物资主要的是钨、锑、锡等矿物产品，都是中国所特产重工业用的重要战略物资。前文说过，在抗日时期，美国已经借借款的机会，控制了一部分这种物资了。在双边协定里，这个企图发展成了一个一般性的规定。这样，美国就取得购买中国战略物资的优先权。同时在条文中又规定了“中国政府将采取必要之特定措施以实施本项之规定”，并且声明“即将开始谈判关于实施本项规定所必要之详细办法”。所谓详细办法当然是关于战略物资的生产运销等的措施。这条规定把这些战略物资的一切主权全都交给美帝之手了。
    双边协定里也包括了一个典型式的马歇尔计划的条件，即通常所谓的对等基金。根据这条件，蒋匪政府须将与美帝赠送美援物资价值相等的蒋币及前述一九四七年救济协定特别账户余款存入伪中央银行的特别账户。协定第五条第五项并明白规定此项账户存款除协定中已规定之用途外，其“任何结余”蒋政府“仅得依其与美利坚合众国政府随时商定之目的，予以处置”。这笔对等基金实际上赋予美帝一个很大的经济力量。我们只要回想北洋政府时代的总税务司英人安格联。那时他利用控制所谓“关余”的一笔款项便实际上做了北洋政府的“太上皇”。美帝在双边协定中取得控制中国财政金融和经济的力量是远大于区区的“关余”。其在蒋匪时代对中国的威力，由此可以想见了。
    此外美帝还利用救济的机会破坏了中国司法权的完整。双边协定第十一条规定中国方面任何措施影响及美国“人民财产或利益时”，美人有权提交美国操纵下的联合国国际法庭。或经双方约定的任何公断法庭裁判或解决。
    为了执行双边协定，美国派了一个驻华执行直接监督之经济合作特别代表，并在特别代表的领导下组织了一个经济合作总署中国分署。这个机构派遣享有外交特权的代表及工作人员遍布全国各大城市及其他经济枢纽地点。它不止全权控制三亿七千五百万美元物资的支配权，并且，透过所谓“对等基金”的办法，控制了等于美援物资同等价值的中国货币存款的使用！当双边协定在一九四八年七月三日在中国签订时他要利用和支持的中国反动政权已到日暮穷途，整个垮台的前夕了。美帝也知道他的寿命不长，所以只定一年的期限。白皮书中透露说：“国务院视援华方案或为将来更多……努力之初步，或为大规模援华之结束”。这个预见倒是不错的。双边协定实施后不到半年，中国人民解放军便席卷全国，美帝阴毒的双边协定及其一切经济侵略措施也随着蒋政权之崩溃而在中国大陆上完全夭折了！所留下来的只是白皮书上的悲惨的讣闻式的历史的叙述与奥斯汀嘴里微弱的无耻的回忆的呼声而已！
