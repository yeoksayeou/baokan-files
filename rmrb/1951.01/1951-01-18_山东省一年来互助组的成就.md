　　Achievements of Mutual Aid Teams in Shandong Province Over the Past Year
    Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry

　　Shandong Province achieved a bumper harvest in 1950. In addition to favorable weather conditions, the Party and the government guided farmers in implementing many measures to increase production. The steady development and consolidation of mutual aid teams was an important guarantee for implementing these production-boosting measures.

　　According to surveys, there were a total of 739,060 mutual aid teams in the province, with 2,900,373 participating households, accounting for 33% of the total number of peasant households in the province. The total number of male and female able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers participating in mutual aid teams was 4,566,484, accounting for 27.5% of the province's total labor force. Among the aforementioned mutual aid teams, 57,218 teams kept regular work records and accounts, accounting for 7.7%; 232,950 teams did not keep work records and accounts, accounting for 31.5%; and 448,892 seasonal small-scale teams, accounting for 60.7%. Generally, the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, as well as small-scale organizational forms, were well-grasped.

　　From a provincial perspective, the development of mutual aid teams was very uneven. For example, in the Jiaozhou and Laiyang areas, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams accounted for more than 60%, and the organized labor force reached about 50%, while in the Tengxian area, only slightly more than 7% of peasant households were organized, and the organized labor force accounted for only 5%. The development of mutual aid teams was closely linked to the degree of farmer mobilization. The degree of work development varied from place to place, and the development of mutual aid teams also varied.

　　Over the past year, many areas have reorganized their mutual aid teams, which has not only increased the quantity but also significantly improved the quality. For example, in the Jishan area of Linshu County, the number of mutual aid teams increased from 302 to 331 after reorganization. In Wanghe Township, before reorganization, better mutual aid teams accounted for 4.3%, average mutual aid teams accounted for 46.8%, and poorer mutual aid teams accounted for 48.9%. After reorganization, better mutual aid teams accounted for 23.4%, average mutual aid teams accounted for 46.8%, and poorer mutual aid teams accounted for 29.8%.

　　Due to being organized, developing water conservancy, deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, improving techniques, and producing more grain, they outperformed individual farmers. For example, Zhao Weishan's team in Wanglankou Village, Heishan District, Laiyang County, increased the yield of various crops by one-sixth to one-fifth compared to previous good years due to deep plowing, timely planting, more weeding, and more fertilizer application. Yu Songchang's team in Wendeng County harvested an average of 271.6 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 64 jin per mu compared to individual farmers. Compared to individual farmers with the same amount of land, each household harvested 1,435.2 jin more grain. This fact greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the masses to organize.

　　Mutual aid teams played a huge role in ensuring the completion of production increase tasks. In the organization work itself, it also corrected the past deviations of coercion and commandism, enabling it to develop steadily forward. However, there are still many problems in the mutual aid teams that need further research and resolution:

　　1. Over the past year, mutual aid teams have achieved many successes in improving agricultural technology and guiding surplus labor into intensive cultivation. For example, the Tai'an Prefectural Office lent out more than 2,000 waterwheels, 92% of which were lent to mutual aid teams. In Wendeng County, 23 teams dug 33 wells, all equipped with waterwheels. The teams hoed millet and sorghum five times, and cotton seven or eight times, and some even hoed eleven times. However, leading cadres failed to summarize the work of mutual aid teams in improving technology, and did not put forward clear slogans and requirements in mutual aid teams for the production increase measures and increased cotton planting to be promoted in the plan, turning the plans of the leading organs into the actions of the broad masses. Therefore, the technical improvement of the masses has sometimes fallen into spontaneity. There are still some disconnections between the intentions of the leadership and the demands of the masses. Therefore, the leadership of the mutual aid teams is empty and weak, causing the mutual aid teams to lose their clear direction and real content.

　　2. The rational use of draft animals and farm implements is an extremely important issue in consolidating mutual aid teams. Over the past year, mutual aid teams in various places have made many innovations in solving this problem. In the past, many places jointly raised livestock, jointly used livestock, and jointly used farm implements without any compensation; the order of use was discussed within the team and not decided by the owner. Now, some unreasonable phenomena in the use of livestock and farm implements have been initially overcome, and the enthusiasm of team members to purchase draft animals and add farm implements has been increased. However, this issue is very complex and must be further studied and resolved.

　　3. Rational work recording and accounting is the key to ensuring voluntariness and mutual benefit. Over the past year, there have been many experiences in the methods of artificial mutual aid, artificial exchange of cattle work, and work recording. However, some places are still not reasonable enough. For example, some teams settle accounts twice a year, one work point equals one work point, and no distinction is made between busy and slack work, which is disadvantageous to those with less land and more labor, affecting the consolidation of the team. Some teams, in order to encourage women to join the team, specially increase women's wages, so that everyone is unwilling to use female workers, which greatly limits the use of female labor. There are also teams that fix the division of labor for women, and do not increase wages even if they do more work, which affects women's enthusiasm for production. The correct approach should be to adopt the method of equal pay for equal work for men and women, according to farming ability.

　　4. Organizational efficiency will inevitably increase, but the use of surplus labor is a very important issue. In addition to guiding farmers to engage in intensive cultivation, it is necessary to organize sideline production according to conditions. However, at present, due to changes in conditions, the sideline production of mutual aid teams has mostly stopped, and the originally concentrated funds have mostly been dispersed. How to support the development of marketable sideline production has a great relationship with consolidating mutual aid teams and increasing income. Cooperatives in some areas have helped mutual aid teams open up sales channels for sideline production, achieving great results. Some mutual aid teams are member groups of cooperatives, and sideline production is carried out under the unified plan and leadership of the cooperatives. Mutual aid teams are the foundation of cooperatives, helping each other and developing together, which is worthy of promotion.

　　山东省一年来互助组的成就
    山东省农林厅
    一九五○年山东全省赢得了丰收，除了雨水调和外，党和政府领导农民进行了很多增产措施，稳步地发展和巩固互助组，是贯彻增产措施的一项重要保证。
    据调查，全省共有互助组七十三万九千零六十个，参加户数共二百九十万零三千七百二十三户，占全省总农民户数的百分之三十三。参加互助组的男女整半劳力共四百五十六万六千四百八十四人，占全省劳力总数的百分之二十七点五。在上述互助组中，常年记工算账的有五万七千二百一十八组，占百分之七点七，不记工算账的有二十三万二千九百五十组，占百分之三十一点五；季节性的小型组有四十四万八千八百九十二组，占百分之六十点七。一般都能掌握自愿两利的原则和小型的组织形式。
    从全省范围看，互助组的发展是很不平衡的。如胶州、莱阳等专区参加互助组的农户已占百分之六十以上，组织劳力已达百分之五十左右，而滕县专区则仅组织农户的百分之七强，组织劳力仅占百分之五。互助组的发展是和农民发动的程度密切结合着的。各地工作发展程度不同，互助组的发展也不同。
    一年来不少地区的互助组都进行了整理，不仅数量有了增加，质量上也有了显著的提高。如临沭县岌山区十四个村的互助组，整理前有三百零二组，整理后增加为三百三十一组。王贺乡的互助组，整理前较好的互助组占百分之四点三，一般的互助组占百分之四十六点八，较差的互助组占百分之四十八点九，整理后较好的互助组占百分之二十三点四，一般的互助组占百分之四十六点八，较差的互助组占百分之二十九点八。
    由于组织起来，发展水利，深耕细作，改进技术，多打了粮食，胜过了单干户。如莱阳县鹤山区望岚口村赵为山组，由于深刨，适时耕种，多锄，多施肥，各种作物都比以往丰年增产六分之一至五分之一。文登县于松长组，全组每亩平均收粮二百七十一点六斤，较单干户每亩增产六十四斤；和地亩相同的单干户比较，每户多收粮一千四百三十五点二斤。这种事实，大大启发了群众组织起来的积极性。
    互助组在保证增产任务的完成上，起了巨大的作用。在组织工作本身，也纠正了过去强迫命令的偏向，使得能稳固地向前发展。但目前在互助组中仍存有不少问题，尚须进一步研究解决：
    一、通过互助组，改进农业技术，并把剩余劳力引导到精耕细作方面来，一年来取得了不少成绩，如泰安专署贷出水车二千余辆，有百分之九十二贷给了互助组。文登县二十三个组中，打了三十三眼井，全装上了水车，该组的谷子、高粱锄五遍，棉花锄七、八遍，甚至有的锄十一遍。但在领导干部对互助组改进技术的工作未能加以总结，对计划中要推广的增产措施和增种棉花，也未在互助组中提出明确的口号和要求，把领导机关的计划通过互助组变成广大群众的行动。因此，群众的技术改进，有的就陷于自流。领导意图与群众要求也还有某些脱节现象。因此对互助组的领导，表现空洞无力，使互助组失掉了明确的方针和真实的内容。
    二、合理使用耕畜和农具，是巩固互助组极其重要的问题。一年来各地互助组在解决这个问题上有了不少的创造。过去各地多是伙养牲口，伙用牲口，伙用农具而无任何代价；使用次序由组内讨论，不由所有者作主。现在已初步克服了使用牲口和农具中的某些不合理的现象，提高了组员购买耕畜和添置农具的积极性。但这个问题是很复杂的，必须进一步研究解决。
    三、合理记工算账是保证自愿两利的关键。一年来在人工互助、人工换牛工记账的方法方面，都有了不少的经验。但有的地方还不够合理。如有的组一年算两次账，一工顶一工，忙闲工不分，这样地少劳力多的吃亏，影响组的巩固。有的组为了奖励妇女入组，特别提高妇女的工资，以致大家不愿用女工，使妇女劳力的使用受到很大限制。也有的组把妇女的分工固定起来，多干活也不提高工资，影响妇女生产的积极性。正确的办法应当是，按照耕作能力，采用男女工同工同酬的办法。
    四、组织起来工作效率必然提高，但剩余劳力的使用是个很重要的问题，除引导农民用于精耕细作外，根据条件组织副业生产，是必要的。但目前由于条件的变化，互助组的副业多已停止，原来集中起来的资金多已分散，如何扶持开展有销路的副业生产，对巩固互助组、增加收入的关系很大。有些地区的合作社帮助互助组打开副业销路，取得很大效果。有的互助组就是合作社的社员小组，副业生产在合作社的统一计划领导下进行，互助组就是合作社的基础，互相帮助、共同发展，是值得推广的。
