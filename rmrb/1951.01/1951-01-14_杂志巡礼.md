Magazine Review

    "New Observer" Volume 2, Issue 1: "New Observer" is undertaking an attempt to create a comprehensive "illustrated" publication. This attempt has begun in the first issue of its second volume. This issue includes works such as Hu Sheng's "Love Our Motherland," Hu Feng's "Bless the Motherland, Bless the People," Lin Danqiu's "Year-End Reflections on the 'Frontline'," Guo Yalin's "The Laughter of the People's Tianshan," Liu Baiyu's "Strong and Happy Soviet Children," Ye Shengtao's "Writing," Shao Yu's "Thousands of Mountains and Rivers" (painting), the illustrated "Biography of the Patriotic Poet Du Fu" (by Feng Zhi, illustrated by Guang Yu), Ye Qianyu's sketches, and Ding Cong's cartoons.

    "New Construction" Volume 3, Issues 3 and 4: Since October of last year, this journal has been transformed into an academic and theoretical periodical. In order to "cultivate a spirit of criticism and self-criticism in academic circles" (see the postscript to the third issue), this journal has established a special "Academic Discussion" column. The third issue (December 1950) published the discussion between Ji Taoda and Fan Hong on the causes of capitalist periodic crises, and the discussion between Lin Xin and Mei Ru'ao on the subject of international law. The fourth issue (January) published the discussion between Zhuang Benxian and He Lin on the issue of Party spirit and class nature, and Luo Ergang's discussion on the centenary date of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising. This spirit of criticism and self-criticism in academic circles is something that needs to be advocated today.

    "Progressive Youth" (formerly "Middle School Student") January Issue: This publication has a history of twenty years. In its early stages, it was quite successful in helping middle school students with language learning and popularizing science. According to the editors' announcement in the previous issue, in order to clearly differentiate its work from other youth periodicals, this journal has decided to restore its initial focus on helping middle school-level youth with cultural learning, which is very correct. In this issue, there is a considerable amount of material for language and history learning, and it is well coordinated with the promotion of patriotism and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement: The article "Advancing in the Anti-American Struggle" summarizes the achievements of students' Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda movement, and points out the progress of youth in this movement; the article "Love the Motherland" provides a detailed exposition on how to promote the spirit of patriotism. The "Symposium on Middle School Language Learning Problems" was attended by teachers and middle school students from Beijing. There are many articles written by middle schools and students, which shows that the mass base is quite broad. However, there are still too many long articles, and some articles have not been closely coordinated with the general policy. It is hoped that improvements can be made gradually in the future.

    "Cultural Learning" Monthly, Inaugural Issue: This is a newly launched publication tasked with helping the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers learn culture, and it is distributed by the East China Xinhua Bookstore General Branch.

    The inaugural issue includes: articles on learning experiences, such as "How Did I Learn Culture?" and "To Be the Master of New China, We Must Study Hard"; articles on language, such as "Can Save a Lot of Words" and "Knowing Characters Alone Is Not Enough to Read Books"; articles on history and geography, such as "The Big China" and "The Long-Haired Rebellion"; articles on current affairs and politics, such as "Hell or Heaven?" and "The Four-Character Formula for Resist America, Aid Korea"; articles on science, such as "Which Foods Are the Most Nutritious" and "Winter Manure Accumulation Methods." In addition, there are columns such as "Reader's Works," "Book Review," "Small Knowledge," "Club," and "Reader Service."

    The publication is quite lively in its layout, concise in its writing, and rich in content. The style includes stories, poems, Spring Festival couplets, illustrations, etc., suitable for adults with a high elementary school education level. Cultural centers and amateur schools in factories, institutions, and schools in various places can use it as supplementary reading material.

    Currently, there are not many popular cultural learning periodicals, and the publication of "Cultural Learning" is of great significance. However, judging from the inaugural issue, the content needs to be more popular, simpler, and more closely integrated with the actual lives of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    "History Teaching" Monthly, Inaugural Issue: This journal was launched this New Year's Day, published by the Tianjin History Teaching Monthly Society, and distributed by the Knowledge Bookstore. Important articles in this issue include "The Donghak Party—The Anti-Feudal and Anti-Imperialist Struggle of Korea" (Zhou Yiliang), which explains the combination of the Korean Donghak Party and the peasant riots at that time from the perspective of class contradictions; "The Evolution of American Imperialist Policy Toward China" (Yang Shengmao), which explains the evolution of American imperialist policy toward China since 1875 based on the development of the American economy; "The Tibetan Government Under the Manipulation of Imperialism" (Li Youyi), which details the imperialist conspiracy of aggression in Tibet; "Iron Officials and Laborers in the Han Dynasty" (Zhang Zhenglang), which examines and explains the relationship between iron and slavery from the stage of social development, determines that the "iron officials and laborers" in the Han Dynasty were slaves, and that the riots of the "iron officials and laborers" were slave revolutions, and puts forward an opinion on the development of Chinese society that needs to be discussed. Judging from the content of this issue, most of them are papers on historiography, and there are fewer studies on teaching methods.

    "Wanbei Literature and Art" Monthly, Inaugural Issue: This journal was launched in mid-December of last year and is a local literary and artistic publication. The opening remarks put forward the policy of "developing literary and artistic work to complete the two major historical tasks of production, disaster relief, Huai River control, and land reform." This policy is put forward in accordance with the local situation. Most of the works in the inaugural issue are aimed at these two themes. Those about land reform include "Long-term Worker and Landlord" and "No Cooking at the Landlord's House"; those about production and self-rescue include "The Couple" and "Sweeping Grain"; those about Huai River control include "Making Weizi Flower Drum," "Yu the Great Controlling the Flood," "Persuading Her Husband to Go to the Dike," and "Huai River Water." The forms of these works include flower drum lanterns, operettas, Peking opera, novels, drum lyrics, poems, living newspapers, new ballads, stories, woodcuts, and pictures, making it a very rich and distinctive local literary and artistic magazine.

    "New Film" Inaugural Issue: "New Film" was launched on January 1st of this year, published by the New Film Magazine Society, and distributed by Xinhua Bookstore. It aims to "serve the audience," hoping to be able to "collect audience feedback and enable the audience to selectively and better appreciate new films," and become a publication that directly connects people's films and the audience. The content of this issue has two special features: a special feature on Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country, and a special feature on "Liberated China." This publication needs to be more lively, and in this regard, the "Popular Film" published in Shanghai has many things to refer to.

### 杂志巡礼

第6版()
专栏：

　　杂志巡礼
    “新观察”二卷一期“新观察”正在从事创办一个“图文并茂”的综合性刊物的尝试。这个尝试已在该刊二卷一期开始。这一期的作品有胡绳的“爱我们的祖国”、胡风的“祝福祖国，祝福人民”、林淡秋的“岁尾年头话“战线””、郭亚林的“人民天山的欢笑”、刘白羽的“坚强而幸福的苏联儿童”、叶圣陶的“写话”、邵宇的“千山万水”（画），图文配合的“爱国诗人杜甫传”（冯至作、光宇绘）叶浅予的速写，丁聪的漫画等。
    “新建设”三卷三期、四期    该志自从去年十月起改为学术理论性的期刊。为了“培养学术界的批评与自我批评的风气”（见该志第三期的编后记），该志特设“学术讨论”栏。第三期（一九五○年十二月号）中发表了季陶达与樊弘关于资本主义周期性危机的原因的讨论，林欣与梅汝璈关于国际法的主体问题的讨论。第四期（一月号）中发表了庄本先与贺麟关于党性、阶级性问题的讨论，及罗尔纲关于太平天国起义百年纪念日期的讨论。这种学术界批评与自我批评的风气，在今天是需要倡导的。
    “进步青年”（原名“中学生”）一月号    这个刊物已有二十年的历史，初期在帮助中学青年语文学习及科学通俗化的工作上做得相当成功。据该刊编者在上期该志中宣布，今后为与其他青年期刊明确分工，该志决定恢复初期帮助中学程度青年文化学习的方针，这是很正确的。本期中语文和历史学习的材料相当多，对发扬爱国主义及抗美援朝运动宣传配合得很好：“在反美斗争中前进”一文，总结学生抗美援朝宣传运动的成绩，指出青年自身在这次运动中的进步；“爱祖国”一文，对如何发扬爱国主义精神作了详尽的阐述。“中学语文学习问题座谈”，有北京市教师及中学同学参加，由中学校及学生撰写的文字有好多篇，足见群众基础相当广。但长文还是太多，有些文字还未能密切配合总方针，希望以后能逐渐改进。
    “文化学习”月刊创刊号    这是一种新近创刊、帮助工农兵大众学习文化为任务的刊物，由华东新华书店总分店发行。
    创刊号内容：关于学习经验的，有“我是怎样学文化的？”，“做新中国的主人必须努力学习”；关于语文的，有“可以省掉不少字”，“光识字不能看书”等；关于历史、地理的，有“地大的中国”，“长毛造反”等；关于时事政治的，有“地狱还是天堂？”，“抗美援朝四字诀”等；关于科学的，有“那些食物最有营养”，“冬天的积肥办法”等。此外还有“读者习作”、“书刊介绍”、“小知识”、“俱乐部”、“读者服务”等栏。
    该刊编排相当活泼，文字精简，内容丰富。文体包含故事、诗歌、春联、插图等，适合于高小文化程度的成年人阅读。各地文化馆和工厂机关学校的业余学校都可以用来作为补充读物。
    目前通俗的文化学习期刊还不多，“文化学习”的刊行意义很大。但从创刊号看，内容还要更通俗、浅显些，更结合工农兵大众的实际生活才好。
    “历史教学”月刊创刊号    该刊今年元旦创刊，天津历史教学月刊社出版，知识书店发行。本期中重要文章如“东学党——朝鲜的反封建反帝斗争”（周一良）从阶级矛盾的观点，说明朝鲜东学党与当时农民暴动结合的情形。“美帝侵华政策的演变”（杨生茂）美国经济的发展说明美帝自一八七五年以来对华侵略政策的演变。“帝国主义操纵下的西藏政府”（李有义）详述帝国主义在西藏的侵略阴谋。“汉代的铁官徒”（张政烺）从社会发展的阶段上，考证、解释铁与奴隶的关系，判定汉代的“铁官徒”是奴隶，“铁官徒”的暴动是奴隶革命，提出了中国社会发展上一个有待商榷的意见。从本期内容看来，多为史学方面的论文，研讨教学方法的较少。
    “皖北文艺”月刊创刊号    该刊去年十二月中旬创刊，是地方性的文艺刊物。卷首提出“为完成生产救灾治淮，土地改革两大历史任务，开展文艺工作”的方针，这个方针是适应当地情况而提出的。创刊号内的作品大都针对这两方面的主题，关于土地改革的有“长工与地主”，“不在地主家煮饭”等；关于生产自救的有“俩口子”，“扫途粮”等；关于治淮的有“做圩花鼓”，“大禹治水”，“劝夫上堤”，“淮河水”等。这些作品的形式，包括花鼓灯、小歌剧、京剧、小说、鼓词、诗、活报、新歌谣、故事、木刻和图片等，是很丰富而有特点的一本地方文艺杂志。
    “新电影”创刊号    “新电影”本年一月一日创刊，新电影杂志社发行，新华书店经售。它以“为观众服务”为宗旨，希望能够“征集观众的反映，并使观众有所选择地，更好地欣赏新电影”，成为人民电影和观众之间直接联系的刊物。本期内容有两个特辑：抗美援朝保家卫国特辑和“解放了的中国”特辑。这个刊物还需要更加活泼些，在这一点上，上海出版的“大众电影”有很多可供参考的地方。
