Xinhua News Agency, January 21st:

To genuinely safeguard workers' lives, safety, and health, and to further enhance workers' production enthusiasm, the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union, at its first second plenary session held on December 16th of last year, discussed the issue of strengthening labor protection work and made a resolution.

The resolution pointed out: "Since the key inspection of labor protection work in state-owned textile factories in Tianjin in February of this year (1950), there has been considerable improvement. However, some state-owned enterprises still fall far short of production needs, while in private enterprises, the phenomenon of neglecting employee safety is still widespread. Labor conditions are extremely poor, accidents occur constantly, and illnesses are increasing, affecting the production enthusiasm of the masses and hindering the further improvement of textile production, resulting in serious losses to the state and society. At a time when private enterprises in various regions have shifted from maintaining and preserving capital to making profits, it is completely unacceptable to adopt such an irresponsible attitude towards these employees who work day and night to enable factories to produce and make money."

In order to quickly correct this serious phenomenon of neglecting workers' safety and health, the resolution requires that trade union organizations at all levels of the China Textile Workers' Union earnestly carry out labor protection work in 1951 based on the following four points:

(1) Trade union organizations at all levels must elevate labor protection work, especially labor protection work in private factories, to the important position it deserves. Labor protection is an important prerequisite for improving employee production enthusiasm and ensuring the completion of national production tasks. Without the necessary safety equipment and labor conditions, there is no guarantee of completing production tasks. Therefore, attitudes that only focus on production while being indifferent and unconcerned about employee safety and health; attitudes that use objective difficulties as an excuse, emphasize that things have always been this way, and do not actively rely on the masses to strive to improve labor conditions under the principle of spending little money; attitudes that passively satisfy themselves with post-accident handling instead of paying attention to actively protecting labor and preventing accidents and diseases; and views and practices that only pay attention to state-owned enterprises while not simultaneously paying attention to private enterprises, or even thinking that labor protection is out of the question for small private factories, are all wrong and detrimental to the cause of people's textile construction and the interests of the working class and must be corrected immediately.

(2) Strict mass supervision of labor protection is the responsibility that trade unions should fulfill in order to protect the interests of the working class and do a good job in production. Trade unions must adopt a very responsible attitude towards the safety and health of employees. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must, in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law, earnestly and responsibly organize all members to assist and supervise the administrative side or capitalists in implementing the provisions of the Common Program: "Implement a system of inspection of factories and mines to improve the safety and hygiene equipment of factories and mines," establish a safety responsibility system, conduct regular major safety and hygiene inspections, implement the Provisional Regulations on Factory Hygiene, and actively improve labor protection facilities. First of all, we must pay special attention to improving safety facilities. Safety first. Safety devices must be installed on all dangerous machines and locations. This is currently the weakest link in labor protection work and the most central link to be improved in the future. Secondly, we must pay attention to improving workshop temperature, humidity, ventilation, and lighting, setting up sufficient boiling water buckets, spittoons, and toilets. At the same time, we should pay attention to increasing medical staff, improving canteens, bathhouses, barbershops, and nurseries, and repairing leaking dormitories and sewers. Organizations at all levels should assist and supervise the administrative side or capitalists in making the improvement of labor protection an important part of formulating the 1951 production plan and specifically stipulate in the collective contract that for enterprises that have made significant achievements in improving labor protection, the trade union must promptly commend them and petition the government to grant rewards. Trade unions must criticize and even protest against all illegal acts that violate government laws and regulations and neglect the safety and health of employees. If the administrative side or capitalists refuse to accept this and thereby cause unfortunate accidents, the trade union must file a lawsuit with the court to subject them to the sanctions of national law. Any unprincipled accommodation will inevitably cause undue losses to the employee masses and production. For such unfortunate events caused by unprincipled accommodation, the trade union organization should not only be subject to organizational punishment but also bear legal responsibility.

(3) Organizations at all levels must establish and improve labor protection agencies.基层 organizations must establish labor protection work committees, strengthen the work of labor protection public inspectors in trade union groups, and hold regular labor protection work meetings to study and resolve various issues related to improving labor protection.

(4) Trade union cadres at all levels must conscientiously study labor protection knowledge and be responsible for conducting safety and health education among employees on a regular basis, conducting education to break superstitions, actively promoting advanced work methods, and improving the technical proficiency of employees to prevent accidents and diseases.

### 保障工人安全健康提高生产积极性  中国纺织工会决议加强劳动保护工作

　　保障工人安全健康提高生产积极性
    中国纺织工会决议加强劳动保护工作
    【新华社二十一日讯】中国纺织工会全国委员会，为切实保障工人生命安全与健康，以进一步提高工人生产积极性，特于去年十二月十六日召开的第一届第二次全体会议上，讨论了关于加强劳动保护工作的问题，并作出决议。
    决议指出：“各地国营纺织工厂的劳动保护工作，自今年（一九五○）二月在天津进行了重点检查以后，已有相当改善，但有些国营企业还远赶不上生产需要，而在私营企业中则还普遍存在着忽视职工安全的现象，劳动条件异常恶劣，事故不断发生，疾病日益增加，影响了群众生产积极性，阻碍了纺织生产的进一步提高，以致造成国家社会的严重损失。在各地私营企业已由维持、保本转向赚钱的时候，对这些日夜工作，使工厂得以生产赚钱的职工，采取这样不负责任的态度，这更是完全不可容忍的。”
    为了迅速纠正这种忽视工人安全和健康的严重现象，决议要求中国纺织工会各级组织根据以下四点，在一九五一年切实作好劳动保护工作：
    （一）纺织工会各级组织必须把劳动保护工作，特别是私营工厂的劳动保护工作，提到应有的重要地位。劳动保护是提高职工生产积极性，保证完成国家生产任务的重要前提，没有必要的安全设备和劳动条件，完成生产任务是没有保证的。因此那种光搞生产，对职工安全和健康不闻不问，漠不关心的态度；那种借口客观困难，强调从来如此，而不积极依靠群众，在花钱不多的原则下，努力改善劳动条件的态度；那种消极满足于对事故的善后处理，而不注意积极保护劳动，预防事故与疾病发生的观点与作法；以及那种只注意国营企业而不同时注意私营企业，甚至以为私营小厂还谈不到劳动保护的观点与作法都是错误的，都是有害于人民纺织建设事业和工人阶级利益的，必须立即纠正。
    （二）对劳动保护实行严格的群众监督，乃是工会为保护工人阶级利益搞好生产所应尽的责任。工会对职工的安全和健康必须采取十分负责的态度。因此纺织工会各级组织必须按照工会法的规定，切实负责组织全体会员协助并监督行政方面或资方，执行共同纲领的规定“实行工矿检查制度以改进工矿的安全和卫生设备”，建立安全责任制，定期举行安全卫生大检查，执行工厂卫生暂行条例，积极改善劳动保护设施，首先必须特别注意改善安全设施，安全第一，在一切有危险的机器和地点必须设立安全装置，这是目前劳动保护工作中最弱的一环，也是今后改进的最中心一环。其次必须注意改善车间温度、湿度、通风和光线，设置足够的开水桶、痰盂和厕所，同时应注意增强医务人员，改善食堂、澡塘、理发室和托儿所，修理破漏宿舍和阴沟等。各级组织均应协助和监督行政方面或资方把改善劳动保护，作为一九五一年制订生产计划的重要部分之一，并具体规定在集体合同中对改善劳动保护有显著成绩的企业，工会必须及时表扬并呈请政府予以奖励，对一切违反政府法令忽视职工安全与健康的非法行为，工会必须进行批评以至提出抗议。如果行政方面或资方拒不接受，并因而酿成不幸事故时，工会更必须向法院起诉，使之受到国家法律的制裁，任何无原则的迁就，都必然会使职工群众和生产遭到不应有的损失。对于这样因无原则的迁就而产生的不幸事件，工会组织不仅应受到组织处分，而且也同样担负着法律责任。
    （三）各级组织必须建立与健全劳动保护机构，基层组织必须建立劳动保护工作委员会，加强工会小组中的劳动保护公共检查员的工作，定期召开劳动保护工作会议，研究与解决改善劳动保护的各种问题。
    （四）各级组织的工会干部必须认真学习劳动保护的知识并负责经常在职工中进行安全卫生教育，进行破除迷信的教育，积极推行先进工作法，提高职工群众技术熟练程度，预防事故和疾病的发生。
