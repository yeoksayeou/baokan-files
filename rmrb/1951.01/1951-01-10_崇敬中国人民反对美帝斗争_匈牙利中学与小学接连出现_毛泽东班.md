　　In admiration of the Chinese People's Struggle Against American Imperialism
    Hungarian Middle and Elementary Schools Successively Establish "Mao Zedong Classes"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th] "Mao Zedong Classes" have successively appeared in Hungarian middle and elementary schools, expressing their love for New China and the leader of the Chinese people with excellent academic achievements. There are now three "Mao Zedong Classes" in elementary schools. In the short period of time after the Chinese People's Volunteers struck American aggressors in Korea, three classes in middle schools have been named "Mao Zedong Class." The "Mao Zedong Classes" of Liezhicheng Lenin Street Middle School and Budapest 20th District Middle School both held naming ceremonies, inviting personnel from our embassy in Hungary to attend.
    The students of the "Mao Zedong Classes" have sent letters to our embassy in Hungary, expressing their admiration for the Chinese people's struggle against American imperialism. Middle school student Savani wrote in his letter: "We know that the struggle of the heroic Chinese people is not only related to the people of the Far East, but also to the fight to defend our freedom and world peace." Middle school student Kilorri said: "We will study harder and never disgrace the badges with Comrade Mao Zedong's portrait that we wear."
    The teachers of the "Mao Zedong Classes" happily told reporters: The students of the "Mao Zedong Classes" have shown an increasing enthusiasm for learning and have become models of discipline for the entire school.

　　崇敬中国人民反对美帝斗争
    匈牙利中学与小学接连出现“毛泽东班”
    【新华社布拉格九日电】匈牙利的中、小学内接连出现了“毛泽东班”，他们以优秀的学业成绩表示了对新中国及中国人民领袖的热爱。现在小学校里已出现了三个“毛泽东班”。在中国人民志愿军在朝鲜打击了美国侵略者之后的短期内，中学里已有三个班级命名为“毛泽东班”。提厄城列宁街中学和布达佩斯第二十区中学的“毛泽东班”，都举行了命名礼，邀请我国驻匈大使馆人员前往参加。
    “毛泽东班”的学生们纷纷致函我国驻匈大使馆，表示他们对中国人民反对美帝国主义斗争的崇敬。中学生萨瓦尼在信中写道：“我们知道英勇的中国人民的斗争不仅关系着远东人民，并且也是为保卫我们的自由及世界和平而战斗的。”中学生基洛里说：“我们将更加努力学习，决不辱没我们佩带的有毛泽东同志肖像的徽章。”
    “毛泽东班”的教师高兴地对记者说：“毛泽东班”的学生已表现了日益增长的学习热情，并且成为全校遵守纪律的模范。
