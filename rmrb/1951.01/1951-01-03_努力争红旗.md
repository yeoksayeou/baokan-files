　　Strive for the Red Banner
   Yan Jinfen, National Model Worker Representative of Shijiazhuang Daxing Textile Factory
    I work at the Shijiazhuang privately-owned Daxing Textile Factory. In the past year, the Party, Labor Union, and Youth League in the factory led us, the entire workforce, to correctly implement the policy of "Unity for Production." Through the "Production Month" in March and the Red May production campaign, the workers outstandingly achieved "Quick Eyes, Quick Hands, Quick Feet," enabling the old spindles from 1921 to produce 1.097 pounds of 20-count yarn per spindle per day. The shuttle looms produced in 1926 averaged over 90.56 yards of cloth per machine per day. These are unprecedented records since the establishment of Daxing. Simultaneously, there have been numerous model achievements in production savings, tool improvements, technology upgrades, and savings in raw materials, supplies, and time. The workers' diligent production has also heightened the enthusiasm of the capitalists in management, leading to the decision to add 10,000 spindles, which have been successively transported; 196 looms have been added and are already in operation. Furthermore, there have been many improvements in management of sanitation equipment and rewards. The facts of this past year have proven that workers doing a good job in production is the central key to the concrete realization of labor-capital mutual benefit; capitalists being able to improve business management and proactively solve problems for workers is also an important guarantee for developing production. We have remembered this experience, and the relationship between the two sides has become even better. Starting in October, we have already launched a long-term production competition based on the existing labor intensity, encouraging workers to use their brains, study technology, and promote standard work methods.
    Personally, in production and work, I am merely an executor of the Party and government's policies and one of the workers striving to do a good job in production. This year, in September, I was selected to attend the National Labor Model Representative Conference, which made me deeply realize that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there is nothing more glorious than labor. Especially seeing Chairman Mao and hearing the instructions of Chairman Mao and the central leaders gave me great inspiration and encouragement. After returning to Shijiazhuang, I immediately participated in the factory's production competition. And in the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation, we launched a patriotic competition, treating the factory as a battlefield, and producing one more piece of yarn is equivalent to producing one more box of bullets to kill the enemy. As a result, our production increased again, increasing the task of producing 173 extra pieces of yarn in a month to as many as 322 pieces.
    Recently, we heard that the National Textile Industry Department has made three beautiful red banners, A, B, and C, saying that in 1951, all public and private factories across the country that can excel in the four conditions of good quality, high output, few accidents, and low cost can get the red banner. Now, our factory is preparing to implement a comprehensive quota in 1951—fixed personnel, fixed materials, fixed quality, and fixed quantity—and then enter a new record movement, striving to achieve good quality, high output, few accidents, and low cost, and strive for a glorious red banner.

　　努力争红旗
   石家庄大兴纺织厂全国劳模代表  阎金芬
    我是在石家庄私营大兴纺织厂作工。在这一年来，厂里党、工、团领导我们全体工人正确贯彻了“团结生产”的方针，经过三月“生产月”和红五月生产竞赛，工人们曾经突出的做到了：“眼快、手快、脚快”，使一九二一年的老纱锭，每日每锭二十支纱出到一点○九七磅。一九二六年出品的上打梭布机，每日每台平均出到过九○点五六码布。这都是大兴开办以来的空前纪录。同时，在生产节约、改进工具，提高技术及节约原料、物料、时间等方面，都有不少模范事迹。工人这样努力生产，资方经营的情绪也高了，决定增加纱锭一万枚已陆续运到；布机增加了一百九十六台，早已开工，同时在管理卫生设备及奖励方面，都有许多改善。这一年来的事实证明了：工人们搞好生产是具体实现劳资两利的中心关键；资方能以改善经营管理，主动给工人解决问题，也是发展生产的重要保证。我们记取了这一经验，双方的关系更好了，我们从十月起已经在已有的劳动强度基础上，开展了开动脑筋，钻研技术，推行标准工作法的长期性的生产竞赛了。
    我个人在生产、在工作上，只是党和政府的政策的执行者，是努力搞好生产的工人之一。今年九月选我出席全国劳模代表大会，使我更深的体验到：在共产党毛主席的领导下，再也没有比劳动更光荣的事了。尤其见到毛主席并听到毛主席及中央各首长的指示，给我很大的启发和鼓舞。我回到石家庄后，立即参加了厂里生产竞赛。并在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中开展了爱国主义竞赛，我们把工厂当作战场，多生产一件纱就等于多生产一箱杀敌的子弹。因而，我们的生产再度提高，把一个月突击增产一百七十三件纱的任务，竟增产到三百二十二件之多。
    最近我们听到全国纺织工业部做了甲、乙、丙三面漂亮的大红旗，说是在五一年，全国公私营各厂，能在质量好、产量高、事故少、成本低四个条件上占优胜的就可以得红旗。现在，我们厂里正准备五一年实行全面定额——定员、定料、定质、定量等，接着就进入新纪录运动，努力做到质量好，产量高，事故少，成本低，争取一面光荣的红旗。
