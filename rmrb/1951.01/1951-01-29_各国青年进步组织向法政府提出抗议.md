　　Xinhua News Agency, 28th: TASS news: Progressive youth organizations in the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Austria have unanimously protested the French government's unreasonable ban on activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth in France. The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, representing over three million German youth, issued a statement on the 27th, firmly protesting the French government's arbitrary behavior and demanding that the French government rescind this decree hostile to the cause of peace. The statement emphasized that the French government, lackeys of Wall Street, are hostile to the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the youth organizations of its member countries because the victorious activities of these groups have seriously hindered the war-mongers' sinister plans to launch a new war. To respond to the attempts of the warmongers, German youth will intensify their struggle against the militarization of West Germany. The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Youth League, in a telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, stated that the persecution by the French government will never weaken the activities of the World Youth Federation; on the contrary, it will make its ranks more united and close-knit. The Danish World Federation of Democratic Youth Committee and the Free Austrian Youth League, with 125,000 members, also protested to the French government on this matter.

　　各国青年进步组织向法政府提出抗议
    【新华社二十八日讯】综合塔斯社消息：德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦和奥地利的进步青年组织一致抗议法国政府无理禁止世界工联、国际民主妇联、世界民主青联在法国境内活动。自由德国青年联盟中央委员会代表三百余万德国青年于二十七日发表声明，坚决抗议法国政府的专横行为，并要求法国政府取消这个敌视和平事业的禁令。声明强调指出：华尔街的仆从——法国政府敌视世界民主青联及其各会员国的青年组织，是因为这些团体的胜利的活动已严重地妨碍了战争贩子们要发动新战争的罪恶打算。德国青年为了回答战争贩子们的企图，将更加紧为反对西德军事化而斗争。捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟中央委员会在致世界民主青联的电文中表示：法国政府的迫害绝不能削弱世界青联的活动，相反地却将使它的队伍更加团结紧密。丹麦世界民主青年联盟委员会和拥有十二万五千会员的自由奥地利青年联盟也就此事向法国政府提出了抗议。
