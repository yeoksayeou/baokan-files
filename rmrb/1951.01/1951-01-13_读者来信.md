　　Ningxia Labor Model Zong Lianben Shares Impressions of Beijing Trip Upon Returning Home Editor:
　　When I returned to the Fourth District of Yanchi from Beijing, the first thing the villagers in the Fourth District asked me was, "Did you see Chairman Mao at the meeting in Beijing?" Then they asked, "Does Chairman Mao look the same as in the pictures?" I said, "Chairman Mao himself looks the same as in the pictures, and he's only in his fifties this year!" They all smiled and were extremely happy when they heard this. This shows the broad masses of working people's love for their leader and that they are constantly thinking of Chairman Mao.
　　When I told them about the situation at the Labor Model Representative Conference, the villagers all said in unison, "Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government are truly extremely caring for us suffering people! If it weren't for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, how could we suffering people have gone to Beijing? All those attending the meeting were formerly suffering people; this is truly something that has never happened in all of history!" When I told them about the situation in Beijing on National Day, the masses all said, "Our strength is great! You only saw so many troops and planes in one place in Beijing; there must be even more in other places!" They also said, "With so many troops and such great strength, we are guaranteed never to be oppressed by the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek 'clearing and suppression corps' again." Han Ke, a 69-year-old man, said, "Young people are having a good life. The People's Government only asks us for a little public grain, and there are no other errands. When the damned Kuomintang was in power, there were grain taxes today, chicken taxes tomorrow, and nameless taxes the day after tomorrow. At the same time, there were so many errands; they were truly squeezing the life out of the poor!"
　　When I promoted seed selection to the masses, Han Yintang said, "Seed selection is a major event. The quality of the crops is greatly related to seed selection. The Ma Jiangsheng millet I selected grows better than anyone else's, and the rice is easy to mill and yields a lot."
　　We are strengthening the organization of the militia to suppress counter-revolutionary elements, protect our homes, and enable us to produce safely and strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea.

　　Union Cadre Kong Fanrong Leads Blood Transfusion for Injured Worker Editor:
　　Let me tell you, on December 24th of last year, an unfortunate incident occurred at our Yongtaihe Steel File Factory in the Seventh District of Beijing. Liang Yucheng, a worker in the filing department, was accidentally caught in a belt on the main shaft during work and was seriously injured. Liang Yucheng is a member of the union committee. He is usually active in production and often leads the workers in the filing department to complete tasks. After the movement to resist America, aid Korea, defend the home, and defend the country began, he worked even harder. Everyone was very anxious about his unfortunate injury.
　　In the emergency room of the Fourth Hospital, the doctor was operating on him, but due to excessive blood loss, he immediately needed someone to transfuse him with 400 CC of blood. At this time, Kong Fanrong, a cadre from the Seventh District Union Office, and workers Wang Shutian, Hou Genyuan, Yuan Zhisheng, and others rushed to volunteer to give blood to the injured. The test results showed that only Kong Fanrong and Wang Shutian had the same blood type as Liang Yucheng. In this way, 400 CC of blood flowed from their bodies into our class brother Liang Yucheng's body. Kong Fanrong and Wang Shutian were usually very weak, and they felt uncomfortable after the blood transfusion, but in order to take care of their injured brother, they often went to see him. The Labor Protection Department of the Seventh District Office of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, and the Health Bureau were all busy with this matter for a while. Under everyone's care, Liang Yucheng has recovered from the operation and is no longer in danger of death.
　　After this incident occurred, the workers of Yongtaihe could not help but recall the dark life under the rule of the reactionary regime in the past. Fan Li said, "In the past, we workers were worse than cattle and horses. If you got sick, they would quickly drive you out, fearing that you would die in the factory and cost them sanitation expenses." Ma Chengsen's words expressed what was in everyone's hearts. He said, "Before liberation, when worker Cong Daozhong got sick, not only did no one care about him, but he wasn't even allowed to eat. He had to sell all his clothes, and in the end, he still died of illness. Today, when workers get sick, there is no problem with getting medical treatment, and cadres even give blood to workers. This shows that today's government is our own government, and the cadres are our own cadres. It also shows that only by working hard in production can we get everyone's love and respect."
　　Yes, the dark days of the past and the loving and happy life of today are creating a strong contrast in the hearts of our workers. Let us repay Chairman Mao, the savior of the people, by working actively and increasing production!

　　Liaodong Yingkou Quarry
　　Should Strengthen Planning and Emphasize Security Editor:
　　In the patriotic production competition, 80% of the workers and staff of the Liaodong Yingkou County Quarry are involved in this upsurge. In December of last year, they overfulfilled the production task. However, there are still some serious problems in the current production. If attention can be paid to solving them, production can be further improved. These problems are:
　　1. Lack of planning in production. Since receiving a batch of quarrying tasks in October 1950, the administrative leaders of the quarry have the idea that "as long as we quarry the stone, it's fine." They underestimated the lack of transportation equipment and the difficulty of the quarry's slopes, which are 30 to 70 degrees and difficult for mine carts to travel on. The workers have repeatedly suggested quickly building a small transportation railway to transport the quarried stones out. However, the administrative负责人 of the quarry has always not paid attention to it, resulting in several groups, such as Zhu Weishi's group, having the quarried stones piled up in the quarry because they could not be transported out in time, which wasted manpower and delayed production.
　　2. Disregard for security education. The quarry's safety system has long been promulgated and revised after discussion by the workers. However, because the administrative leaders believe that "the slope of the track is large and curved, and the car brakes have problems, accidents are inevitable," they lack daily security education and do not investigate responsibility after accidents occur, making the security system a formality. Ren Yufa, a stone transport worker, violated the driving regulations when releasing the car, and the speed exceeded the quota by more than three times, resulting in derailment and a broken left leg. Such accidents caused by violations of operating procedures have not been taken seriously. In October and November of last year, the quarry had 11 accidents, injuring more than 20 workers.
　　3. The trade union does not lead production. There is no trade union committee in the quarry, only a trade union director and a clerk who are separated from production. Their regular work is to help the administration buy grain and firewood for the workers, and to sign collective contracts with the workers on behalf of the administration, becoming the administration's agent. The trade union never pays attention to discovering and cultivating active elements in production among the workers, and does not support and improve the original three model production groups. Since the beginning of November last year, they have not convened a meeting of the workers of the model groups, resulting in their production enthusiasm and production efficiency gradually decreasing. In addition, due to a long-term lack of political education, some workers in the quarry still have the idea of "work one day, count one day, earn a little, and spend a little."
　　It is hoped that the leading authorities of the quarry can quickly improve these shortcomings and move the patriotic production competition forward.

　　Learn from the Lessons of Overworking Workers
　　Gunny Sacks Should Be Made According to Standard Capacity Editor:
　　The Tianjia'an Huai River Grain Transportation Station of the Wanbei Administrative Office Grain Bureau had a worker die from overwork because the grain bags were too heavy. From November 13th to December 20th, the station planned to transport 70 million jin of damaged rice transferred from the Chaohu Special District and the Hefei Grain Station. Wen Zongming, the leader of the Second Group of the Fourth Branch of the Grain Station, was a young and strong man, but because he carried two millet bags (weighing 400 jin in total) on December 6th, and the next night he went to unload the goods from the train, he was so tired that he vomited blood and died on the fourth night. In addition, worker Yang Lianzhi also vomited blood from carrying bags and fell ill for more than half a month. Among the 256 workers in the branch union, 17 workers became ill from being crushed by the grain bags being too heavy. According to our information, the heaviest grain bags sent by the Hefei Grain Station weighed 306 jin, the medium-sized bags weighed 240-250 jin, and the smallest bags also weighed more than 200 jin. There was no health education among the workers, and workers are easily injured in their lung cells and micro-vessels when carrying bags. We have now telegraphed the Chaohu Special District and the Hefei Grain Station that the weight of the bags should not exceed 200 jin when they are repacked. Based on this situation, we suggest that all public and private gunny sack factories across the country should learn from this painful lesson and manufacture gunny sacks according to standard capacity.

　　Propaganda Work Should Be Carried Out With the Development of the Situation Editor:
　　I was instructed by the Prefectural Committee some time ago, along with other comrades, to go to Daxing County in our district to inspect the propaganda work of the movement to resist America and aid Korea, as well as other work. I found that the main problem in Daxing County's current propaganda work is the lack of new propaganda materials that keep pace with the development of the situation. From mid-November to mid-December last year, the county organized three propaganda blitz weeks and carried out a relatively wide range of current affairs propaganda. However, because the content of the propaganda was generally the same and repetitive, later when the cadres went to the countryside to talk about current affairs, some of the masses (mostly village cadres, party members, and League members) said, "It's the two camps again!" After the cadres finished speaking a paragraph, some of the masses could guess the content of the next paragraph. For example, after the cadres introduced that American imperialism is a paper tiger, the masses would say, "It's strategic weaknesses again: long front lines, distant rear, insufficient troops. Below is that the atomic bomb is not terrible, we advocate banning its use..."
　　Are there currently few current affairs materials? According to what is published in our newspapers, there are quite a few. The central problem is that comrades lack comprehensive ability. Therefore, I suggest that our newspapers frequently publish some comprehensive and systematic popular articles based on the development of current affairs, such as the past publications "How to Understand America" and "Questions and Answers on Atomic Bombs." At present, we need to comprehensively introduce the situation of the Korean War (from the beginning to the future of the war), a summary of the political struggle between us and the imperialist camp in the United Nations, and so on. In this way, we can further deepen and improve the masses on their existing level of current affairs understanding.

    宁夏劳动模范宗连本回乡后畅谈进京观感编辑同志：
    我从北京回到盐池四区的时候，四区的老乡见了我，第一句话便问我：“你到北京开会见到毛主席了吗？”接着就又问：“毛主席和像片上照的一样吗？”我说：“毛主席本人与像片上照的一样，今年才五十多岁！”他们听了都是笑迷迷的，高兴极了。这就说明了广大劳动人民对自己领袖的热爱与时时刻刻在惦念着毛主席。
    当我向他们说到开劳动模范代表会议的情形时，老乡们都异口同声地说：“毛主席，共产党，人民政府对咱们受苦人实在是爱护极了！若不是共产党毛主席及人民政府，咱们受苦人怎么能会到北京呢？开会的都是过去受苦人，这真是万古千秋未有过的事！”当我说到国庆节那天在北京的情形时，群众都说：“咱们的力量大着哩！你只在北京一个地方就见了这么多的军队和飞机，别的地方准更多！”又说：“我们有这么多的军队，这么大的力量，保险今后永远不再受国民党蒋介石‘清乡团’的压迫了。”六十九岁的老汉韩科说：“年轻人赶上过好光景了。人民政府只向咱们要一点公粮，别的啥差事也没有，狗日的国民党在时，今粮捐，明鸡捐，后天无名捐，同时差事还多的很，真是逼穷人的命！”
    当我向群众宣传选种时，韩胤唐说：“选种是一件大事，庄稼长的好坏对选种有很大的关系，我选的马缰绳谷子，比谁家长的都好，米也好碾、打的又多。”
    我们正在加强组织民兵，镇压反革命分子，来保卫自己的家，使我们能安全生产，加强抗美援朝的力量。

    崇高的阶级友爱
    工会干部孔繁荣领导给负伤工人输血编辑同志：
    告诉你，去年十二月二十四日，我们北京市七区私营永泰和钢锉厂发生了一件不幸的事情。刮锉部工人梁玉成因工作中不慎被皮带绞到天轴上，身负重伤。梁玉成是工会委员，平时生产积极，经常领导刮锉部工人完成任务，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动展开后，他干得更起劲。这次不幸负伤，大伙都非常着急。
    在第四医院的急诊所里，大夫在给他动手术医治，但由于流血过多，马上需要有人输给他四百ＣＣ的血。这时七区工会办事处干部孔繁荣，厂里的工人王书田、侯根源、袁志生等争先恐后愿意给负伤者输血。检验结果，只有孔繁荣、王书田两个人的血型和梁玉成相同。这样，四百ＣＣ的血便由他们两人体内流到我们的阶级兄弟梁玉成身上。孔繁荣和王书田平时身体都很孱弱，输血后都感到不舒服，但他们为了照顾负伤的兄弟，还常去看他。市总工会七区办事处劳保部、市人民政府劳动局和卫生局，都为这件事忙了一阵子。在大伙的关切下，梁玉成经过动手术后，已经没有生命危险了。
    这件事发生后，永泰和工人们不禁回忆起过去在反动政权统治下的黑暗生活。范礼说：“过去我们工人是牛马不如的。病了赶紧把你撵出去，怕你死在厂子里花卫生费。”马成森的话更说出了大伙心窝里的意思。他说：“解放前工人丛道忠病了，不但没人管，而且饭都不让吃，只好把自己的衣服卖光了，最后还是病死。今天，工人病了，医病不成问题，干部还为工人输血，这说明了今天的政府是咱们自己的政府，干部是咱们自己的干部。同时也说明只有在生产上努把力，才能得到大伙的爱护与尊敬。”
    是的，过去黑暗的日子和今天友爱幸福的生活，都在咱工人心中起着强烈的对比。让咱们用积极干活、提高生产来报答人民的救星毛主席吧！

   辽东营口采石场
   应加强计划性重视保安编辑同志：
    辽东营口县采石场在爱国主义生产竞赛中，有百分之八十的职工卷入这一热潮。去年十二月份并超额完成生产任务。但目前生产中还严重地存在着一些问题，如能注意加以解决，生产是可以更提高一步的。这些问题是：
    一、生产缺乏计划性。自一九五○年十月该场接到一批采石任务后，行政领导干部存在着“只要打出石头就行”的思想，对运输器材的缺乏和石场斜坡系三十度至七十度、不易行驶矿车的困难则估计不足。工人曾多次建议赶紧建筑运输小铁道，以便将已采好的石头运出。但石场行政负责人始终未予注意，致后来朱维世等几个小组，采出来的石头因未能及时运出而堆满石场，既浪费人力又耽误生产。
    二、漠视保安教育。本来采石场的安全制度早已公布，并经过工人讨论后修改。但由于行政领导干部认为：“轨道坡度大且弯曲，车闸又有毛病，发生事故是不可免的。”因此日常既缺乏保安教育，事故发生后也不追究责任，使保安制度流于形式。运石工人任玉发放车时违反行车规程，速率超过定额三倍以上，以致脱轨后将左腿压断。像这样因违反操作规程而发生的事故，也未引起重视。该场去年十、十一两个月发生的事故达十一次，撞伤工人二十余人。
    三、工会不领导生产。采石场没有工会委员会的组织，只有一个脱离生产的工会主任和一个干事。经常工作是帮助行政替工人买粮、买柴，代替行政向工人订集体合同，成为行政的代理人。工会从来不注意在工人中发现与培养生产中的积极分子，对原来的三个模范生产小组也不加以扶植与提高。从去年十一月初到现在，一直没有召集模范小组的工人开过一次会，以致他们的生产情绪和生产效率逐渐降低。此外由于长期缺乏政治教育，该场还有部分工人存在着“干一天算一天，干一点赚一点”的想法。
    希望采石场领导当局，能够迅速改进这些缺点，使爱国主义的生产竞赛前进一步。

    接受累坏工人的教训
    制麻袋应按标准容量编辑同志：
    皖北行署粮食局田家庵治淮运粮站，因粮包太重，发生累死工人事件。该站于十一月十三日起至十二月二十日止，预计要搬运巢湖专区与合肥粮站调运的糟米七千万斤。粮站第四支会第二大组组长闻宗明是一个年青体壮的人，但因为他在十二月六日有一趟扛了两个小米包（共重四百斤），第二天夜里又去卸火车上的货，累得他吐血，到第四天夜里就死了。另外有工人杨连之也因扛包吐血，病倒了半个多月。该支工会二百五十六人在这次搬运中，就有十七名工人因粮包太重，压得生病了。据我们知道合肥粮站送来的粮包最重的有三百零六斤，中等袋为二百四、五十斤。巢湖专署所送的粮食，每包最重者为二百七、八十斤，中等粮包为二百五十多斤，最小包亦在二百斤以上。没有在工人中进行保健教育，工人扛包时，很容易伤肺细胞和微血管。现在我们已电请巢湖专署与合肥粮站再次装包时，不应超过二百斤重量。据此情况，我们建议全国各地公私营制造麻袋工厂应接受这次的惨痛教训，要按标准容量制造麻袋。
                               皖北田家庵粮食第三仓库  徐明
    应随着形势发展进行宣传工作编辑同志：
    我年前曾奉地委指示，与其他同志到我区大兴县检查抗美援朝运动宣传工作及其他工作。我发现大兴县在目前宣传工作中的主要问题，是缺乏随着形势进展的新的宣传材料。该县在去年十一月中到十二月中，曾组织了三次宣传突击周，进行了较广泛的时事宣传。但因宣传内容一般化，重复，到后来干部下乡一讲时事，有些群众（村干、党员、团员较多）就说：“又是两个阵营！”干部说完一段，有些群众就猜出下段内容。比如说，干部介绍了美帝是纸老虎后，群众就说：“又是战略弱点：战线长、后方远、兵力不足。下边又是原子弹不可怕，我们主张禁止使用……。”
    当前时事材料是不是少呢？按我们报纸上发表的来看是不少的。中心问题是同志们缺乏综合能力。因此，我建议我们的报纸经常根据时事发展情况，发表一些综合性的系统的通俗的文章，像过去发表的“怎样认识美国”，“关于原子弹问答”等。在目前就需要综合介绍朝鲜战争形势（由开始到现在战局前途等），联合国中我与帝国主义阵营之间的政治斗争综述等。这样，就能把群众在现有的时事水平上，更深入地提高一步。
