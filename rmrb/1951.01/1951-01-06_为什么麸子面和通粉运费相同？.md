　　Why are wheat bran flour and macaroni charged the same freight?
To the Editor:
    In order to supply some living materials to disaster victims and pig feed for the masses in non-disaster areas, our county purchased four thousand bags of second-grade flour (actually wheat bran flour) from the Tianjin North China Cooperative Depot on December 7th. It was shipped by train from Tianjin and unloaded in Gucheng, with a freight charge of 852,000 yuan per 30 tons (one railcar). On December 11th, our county purchased another 1,400 bags from Tianjin. After the railcar was loaded, the railway inspection deemed that the second-grade flour should be calculated according to the macaroni freight standard, raising the freight to 2,247,200 yuan per 30 tons, and insisted on retroactively adding the freight for the 4,000 bags already shipped on the 7th. Our county has already sold the previous batch of goods, and if this amount is added, the business will suffer a great loss. Our county believes that macaroni costs 82,000 yuan per bag of 42 jin, while second-grade flour costs 13,000 yuan per bag of 36 jin (if second-grade flour is calculated according to macaroni freight, it accounts for one-tenth of the total value), and the price difference is huge. Raising the freight to the macaroni price seems unreasonable. Tianjin wheat bran costs 27,000 yuan per 100 jin, and from the price point of view, the difference between second-grade flour and wheat bran is negligible. We believe that we cannot raise the freight price simply because the flour factory has the brand name "flour". We believe that it is better to calculate the freight according to wheat bran to take care of disaster relief and increase production (feeding pigs is increasing production). Otherwise, another freight level should be listed appropriately. We wonder if our opinion is appropriate, and we ask the Ministry of Railways to reply to us.

### 为什么麸子面和通粉运费相同？

　　为什么麸子面和通粉运费相同？编辑同志：
    我县为着供给灾民一部分生活资料和非灾区群众养猪饲料，于十二月七号，在天津华北合作货栈买来四千袋次粉（实际就是麸子面）。在天津用火车起运，在固城卸车，每三十吨（一车皮）给八十五万二千元运费。十一号我县又从天津买来一千四百袋，待装了货车后，经铁路上检查，认为次粉应该按通粉运费标准计算运费，将运费每三十吨提高到二百二十四万七千二百元，并硬让将七号已运来的四千袋也增补上运费。我县因为前批货物已经卖出，如果增上该部分款子，经营上就受到很大损失。我县意见，通粉每袋四十二斤，八万二千元，次粉每袋三十六斤，一万三千元（次粉如按通粉运费计，即占了总值十分之一），价格相差悬殊。运费提到通粉价格似为不合理。天津麸子每百斤二万七千元，从价格上看来，次粉与麸子也相差无几。我们认为不能因为面粉工厂按上了“粉”的牌子，就将运费提高价格。我们认为照顾救灾和增加生产（喂猪是增产）以按麸子计算运费较好。不然也应该另列运费等级较为适当。我们的意见不知是否有当请铁道部答复我们。
