　　Seriously Handle Outstanding Payments in the Autumn Grain Collection

Currently, the autumn grain collection in various regions has mostly been stored in warehouses, and some regions have completed the collection entirely. Some regions, such as Yiyuan County in Shandong and Shouchang County in Zhejiang, have no outstanding payments from any household, and the masses are very satisfied. However, in a few regions, cadres have become complacent and relaxed, satisfied with the "basically" or "largely" completed task figures. For example, in Jinhua County, Zhejiang, only 85% of the tax amount was collected, and they considered the task successfully completed. Many assistants requested "to go home and rest," and some thought that "the outstanding amount is not large, and the finance and grain cadres can handle it." Some even withdrew finance and grain cadres to work on land reform before the autumn collection was completed, believing that "a rough completion is enough, there will always be outstanding payments every year." This is not conducive to the requirements of balancing financial revenue and expenditure and the principles of a reasonable burden. Moreover, "those who delay benefit, and those who pay early suffer," leaving a bad impression on the masses and creating difficulties for collection in the coming year.

In the past, farmers in the old liberated areas had long criticized the phenomenon of "trailing debts" in the autumn grain collection, saying it was like "whipping the fast ox." Because many landlords and rich peasants in the new areas left outstanding payments in the autumn grain collection of 1949, farmers in some parts of the new areas also expressed dissatisfaction, saying, "Those who pay early get beaten, those who pay late get scolded, and those who don't pay get away with it." Some individual farmers even said, "It's better to pay late than to pay early, and it's better not to pay than to pay late." Counter-revolutionaries and special agents also took advantage of our shortcomings in work to incite farmers to "resist stubbornly or delay softly." Some of the masses, misled by them, also harbored a wait-and-see attitude, which cannot but arouse serious vigilance.

Therefore, changing the sluggish phenomenon in the autumn grain collection and handling the outstanding payment problem in a timely, serious, and correct manner, using facts to correct the worry that "those who take the lead in paying grain suffer," is a matter that cannot be ignored at present. To achieve this, we must first recognize that handling the outstanding payment problem is the final and necessary step in implementing regulations and carrying out policies, and it should become a mass movement to inspect the implementation of policies. It is wrong to clear outstanding payments for the sake of clearing outstanding payments, and it is also wrong to "write them off by expanding reductions and exemptions." We should deeply understand the reasons for the outstanding payments, act in accordance with the regulations, and achieve "reduce what should be reduced, exempt what should be exempted, levy according to rates, and collect in full."

According to our understanding, the general reasons for outstanding payments are mainly: (1) Improper reductions and exemptions, such as egalitarian reductions and exemptions, where those who should have been reduced were not reduced or reduced less, while those who should not have been reduced were reduced; (2) Insufficient care for the families of martyrs, soldiers, and staff, as well as elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households with no labor; (3) Individual families of martyrs, soldiers, and staff, honorary soldiers, and cadres have special privilege mentality and want to pay less or not at all; (4) Individual yields are abnormally high or low, resulting in an unbalanced burden; (5) Individual grain was rejected due to poor quality and disagreements with the grain depot; (6) Lazy people and loafers waste grain and cannot pay on time; (7) Unlawful landlords deliberately resist stubbornly or delay softly; (8) Individual selfish and cunning people intentionally delay payment. From checking these reasons in the process of implementing the policy, we know that there are three main points: (1) The policy of reductions and exemptions is not sufficiently implemented, which is the main reason for the outstanding payments of disaster-stricken households and households with no labor or with difficulties. (2) Ideological education and policy publicity are not enough. This is the main reason for the arrears of lazy people and selfish and cunning households. (3) The suppression of unlawful landlords and bandits and special agents is not enough, so they dare to resist and delay payment stubbornly. Based on the above analysis, the principle for handling outstanding payments should be: "Reduce and exempt according to law those who should be reduced and exempted," "Educate and pursue those who are able to pay but intentionally delay," "Punish according to law those who deliberately resist payment." The method of clearing should be: conduct in-depth investigation and understanding of the arrears households, analyze the reasons for their arrears, and, based on the specific situation and the above principles, clear them through the masses. Careless treatment of outstanding payments, ignoring them, or forcing collection indiscriminately should be prevented.

The autumn grain collection experience of East China and Central South provinces proves that: all those who adopt the method of "publicizing regulations, mobilizing the masses, investigating and determining production, calculating and levying according to rates, reducing and exempting according to law, and collecting in full," and strengthen leadership from beginning to end, without slackening or being lazy, are both stable and fast; while those who are eager for quick results, numb, and careless are often counterproductive. As for dragging on and delaying and missing the opportunity, it will create difficulties for the next step of work. Therefore, we believe that we should immediately learn from the lessons, seize the opportunity, and handle outstanding payments in a timely manner so that the country's collection work can be completed smoothly.

### 认真处理秋征中的尾欠问题

　　认真处理秋征中的尾欠问题
    目前各地区的秋征公粮，已大部入仓，有些地区已全部入仓。有些地区如山东的沂源县、浙江的寿昌县，没有一户尾欠，而且群众也很满意。但也有少数地区，干部有自满松懈思想，满足于“基本上”或“大体上”完成任务的数字，如浙江金华县仅完成应征税额的百分之八十五，即认为已胜利完成任务，很多助征人员要求“回家休息休息”，有的认为“尾欠数字不大，财粮干部搞一下就行了”。有的甚至秋征尚未结束，却把财粮干部抽出搞土地改革去了。认为“大致完成就行了，那年也少不了尾欠”。这是不利于财政收支平衡的要求和合理负担政策的原则的，而且“拖欠的沾光，早缴的吃亏”，给群众留下坏的印象，给来年征收造成困难。
    过去，老解放区农民对秋征“拖尾巴”的现象，早就提出过批评，说这是“鞭打快牛”。由于一九四九年秋征中新区不少地主富农留下尾欠，新区有些地方的农民也表示不满说：“早缴的挨打，迟缴的挨骂，不缴的便罢。”个别的农民甚至说：“先交不如迟交，迟交不如不交。”土匪特务分子也利用了我们工作上的缺点，趁机鼓动农民进行“硬挨软拖”。部分群众受其蒙蔽也存在观望等待心理，这是不能不引起严重警惕的。
    因此，改变秋征中拖泥带水的现象，及时、认真和正确地处理尾欠问题，用事实纠正“带头缴粮吃亏”的顾虑是当前不容忽视的事。要做到这一步，首先必须认识处理尾欠问题是执行条例贯彻政策最后的和必要的一个步骤，它应该成为一个群众性检查政策执行情况的一个运动。为扫清尾欠而扫清尾欠是不对的，“以扩大减免不了了之”也是错误的。应该深入了解尾欠原因，按条例办事，做到“当减者减，当免者免，依率计征，十足收齐”。
    根据我们的了解，一般尾欠的原因，主要是：（一）减免不当。如平均主义的减免，当减者未减或少减，不当减免者倒减免了；（二）对烈士、军人、工作人员家属，老弱孤寡无劳力困难户照顾不够；（三）个别烈士、军人、工作人员家属，荣誉军人和干部存在特权思想，想少缴或不缴；（四）个别产量畸高畸低负担不平衡；（五）个别因缴粮质量差被退回和粮库闹意见；（六）懒汉二流子把粮食浪费掉，按期交不上；（七）不法地主故意硬抗软拖；（八）个别自私刁滑的有意拖欠。从执行政策的过程中来检查这些原因，可知主要的有三点：（一）减免政策贯彻不够，这是受灾户、无劳力困难户尾欠的主要原因。（二）思想教育和政策宣传不够。这是二流子、自私刁滑户拖欠的主要原因。（三）对不法地主及土匪特务镇压不够，致使他们敢于抗缴硬拖。据上分析，处理尾欠的原则，应当是：“该减免者依法减免”，“能负担有意拖欠者，教育追清”，“故意抗缴者依法惩办”。清理的方法应当是：对尾欠户进行深入的调查了解，分析其拖欠原因，根据具体情况和上述原则，通过群众，予以清理。对尾欠马虎从事、置之不理或不分皂白地强迫追缴，都应加以防止。
    华东、中南各省秋征经验证明：凡采取“宣传条例、发动群众、调查定产、按率计征、依法减免、十足收齐”的方法，并自始至终加强领导、不懈不怠的，是既稳且快；而急于求成、麻痹大意的则往往是欲速不达。至于拖拉迟缓贻误时机，更会给下一步工作造成困难。因此，我们认为，应即接受教训，抓紧时机，及时处理尾欠，使国家的征收工作能够顺利完成。
