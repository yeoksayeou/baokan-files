　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, January 11th: Faculty, staff, and students of universities, middle schools, and primary school teachers founded by Christian and Catholic churches in Wuhan held anti-insult, anti-defamation, and anti-imperialist patriotic rallies. With immense anger, they denounced the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and unanimously expressed their support for the State Council's decision on December 29th of last month to take over schools accepting U.S. subsidies and run them independently.

　　Before liberation, all major powers related to economy, administration, and school affairs of church schools were completely controlled by imperialist elements. Chinese principals were nominal heads without real authority, and the treatment of Chinese teachers was extremely unreasonable compared to that of American teachers. Li Huizu, the principal of Wenhua Middle School, received only one-fifth of the salary and benefits of an average American teacher. American administrators in church schools arbitrarily insulted Chinese teachers and staff, and dismissed them at will. For example, the workers of Huazhong University had never had dormitories on campus. Last year, when the school built dormitories for the workers, the American accounting director, Ke Yuehan, and the American professor, Xue Shihe, firmly opposed it, openly saying, "Workers are only fit to sleep on tables and under stairs." In many church schools, there were "forbidden zones" where only Americans were allowed to be active, and Chinese people were not allowed to go. Xue Shihe, an American professor at Huazhong University, once tied a very young student from Wenhua Middle School who was picking mulberry leaves near his residence to a tree and cursed, "Chinese, slaves!" Now, under the just pressure of the students, these "forbidden zones" have been abolished.

　　In order to further achieve the goal of enslaving the Chinese people, the U.S. imperialists stipulated that English be the main course in all church schools. In the past, Wenhua Middle School used English for all slogans during morning exercises, military drills, and physical education. Notices and roll calls were all in English; even Chinese history and geography classes used English textbooks. Student grading was determined by English proficiency.

　　At these patriotic rallies, teachers and students of various church schools condemned the ideological poisoning they had suffered from U.S. imperialism. Yang Xihui, a student at Wenhua Middle School, said, "In the past, I was proud to have Americans teach me English; I imitated the foreign style when I walked; and I fantasized about going to the United States. I was enthusiastic about the poisonous American movies; and I was so bored that I prided myself on remembering the names of many American stars." Wang Xiaoming, a student at Xilida Girls' School, said, "I used to hate that I was not an American." There are many such condemnations. After eliminating these poisonous thoughts, everyone realized the loveliness of the great motherland and expressed the courage and determination to wash away these humiliations and settle this account with U.S. imperialism. Jiang Enzhan, a student at Bowen Middle School, said, "I am determined to completely clean my brain and love my country with my sincere heart."

　　All church schools in the city jointly issued an anti-insult and anti-defamation declaration, expressing their warm support for the "Report on the Policy of Dealing with Cultural Education, Relief Organizations, and Religious Groups Receiving U.S. Subsidies" by Vice Premier Guo Moruo of the State Council, resolutely severing ties with U.S. imperialism, and assisting the government in making church schools subsidized by U.S. imperialism schools run entirely by the Chinese people themselves.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 11th: Professors and people from all walks of life who studied in the United States in Chongqing, including Zhang Hongyuan, Chen Jianheng, Kang Xinming, Wu Jinhang, and Pan Dakui, totaling eighty-four people, jointly signed a declaration, denouncing the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism. The declaration stated: We have lived in the United States for many years and know the inside story of the United States. It is ruled by a few big capitalists. Truman, Acheson, Marshall, Austin, and MacArthur are all loyal lackeys of Wall Street. Its domestic policy is to oppress and exploit the people and strangle democracy, while its foreign policy is aggression and launching wars. The declaration continued: We recognize that the power of the people determines everything, and the power of the world's peace and democracy camp is strong. U.S. imperialism is isolated, and its only self-proclaimed atomic bomb cannot win on the battlefield, let alone scare the Chinese people. U.S. imperialism, this paper tiger, has recently been exposed under the heavy blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The declaration concluded: In order to defend the motherland and strive for lasting world peace, we are all willing to fight to the end under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country.

　　武汉各教会学校举行爱国集会
    在渝留美归国人士亦发表宣言痛斥美国侵略政策
    【新华社汉口十一日电】武汉市基督教和天主教所创办的大、中学校的师生员工和小学教师，纷纷召开反侮辱、反诽谤、反帝爱国大会，以无比的愤怒，控诉美帝国主义的侵略罪行，并一致表示拥护政务院上月二十九日的决定，把接受美国津贴的学校接收自办。
    解放前，各教会学校的经济、行政、校务等大权，完全控制在帝国主义分子手中，中国校长都是有职无权的，中国教师的待遇和美籍教师的待遇相比极不合理。文华中学校长李辉祖的薪津仅及一个普通美国教员的五分之一。教会学校中的美国主持人对中国教师员工恣意侮辱，随意解聘。例如华中大学的工友们一向在校内没有宿舍。去年，该校给工友建造宿舍时，美籍会计主任柯约翰和美籍教授薛世和却坚决反对，并明目张胆地说：“工人只配睡在桌子上楼梯下。”在好多教会学校里都设有“禁区”，只许美国人在那里活动，而不准中国人去。华中大学的美籍教授薛世和就曾经把到他住宅附近采桑叶的文华中学的一个年纪很小的学生绑在树上，还辱骂道：“中国人，奴隶性！”现在，在学生们的正义压力下，这些“禁区”都取消了。
    美帝国主义者为了进一步达到奴役中国人民的目的，曾将英文规定为各教会学校的主要课程。以前文华中学上早操、上军操和上体育时，喊的口号一律用英语。布告和点名册全用英文；甚至中国历史、地理课也用英文课本。学生的编级要按英文程度来决定。
    在这些爱国大会中各教会学校的师生控诉了美帝国主义给自己思想上的毒害。文华中学学生杨锡汇说：“以前，我曾经以美国人教我读英文为光荣；我走路时学洋人派头；并幻想着到美国去。我竟会热中美国有毒素的电影；并无聊到以记得许多美国明星的名子来自傲”。希理达女中的学生王晓明说：“我曾以自己不是美国人为恨事”。像这样的控诉是很多的。大家在肃清了这些有毒的思想后，都认识到伟大祖国的可爱，并且表示有勇气、有决心、清洗这些耻辱，和美帝国主义清算这笔账。博文中学学生姜恩湛说：“我坚决要把自己的脑筋完全洗干净，用自己的赤心来爱自己的祖国。”
    全市各教会学校并联合发表反侮辱、反诽谤宣言，表示热烈拥护政务院副总理郭沫若“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的报告”，坚决与美帝国主义割断联系，并协助政府使美帝国主义所津贴的教会学校成为完全由中国人民自己办的学校。
    【新华社重庆十一日电】重庆各大学留美教授及各界留美人士张洪沅、陈剑恒、康心明、吴晋航、潘大逵等八十四人联合签名发表宣言，痛斥美帝国主义侵略政策。宣言略称：我们在美国生活多年，深知美国内幕，它是被少数大资本家统治着的，杜鲁门、艾奇逊、马歇尔、奥斯汀、麦克阿瑟之流正是华尔街的忠实走狗。它的对内政策是压迫、剥削人民，绞杀民主，而对外的政策即是侵略，发动战争。宣言继称：我们认识到人民的力量决定一切，全世界和平民主阵营的力量是强大的，美帝国主义是孤立的，而它唯一自炫的原子弹，并不能决胜于战场，更不能吓倒中国人民。美帝国主义这只纸老虎，最近在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的沉重打击下，被戳穿了。宣言最后称：为了保卫祖国，为了争取世界的持久和平，我们全体一致愿在伟大的领袖毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，为抗美援朝保家卫国而奋斗到底。
