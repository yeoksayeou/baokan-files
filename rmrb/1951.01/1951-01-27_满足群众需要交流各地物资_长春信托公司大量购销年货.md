　　Meeting the Needs of the Masses by Exchanging Goods from Various Regions
    Changchun Trust Company Purchases and Sells New Year Goods in Large Quantities
    Last year, agricultural products had a bumper harvest, and urban industrial production also mostly recovered or developed further. The purchasing power of the broad masses of farmers and workers has already increased. Therefore, the needs of the people this Spring Festival are bound to surge. In view of this situation, the Changchun Trust Company, starting from November, cooperated with various public and private enterprises to prepare a large quantity of New Year goods through methods such as purchasing, consignment sales, and ordering. The company first investigated the types of New Year goods and their origins according to the needs of the Changchun area. It then sent purchasing teams with 7 billion yuan (Northeast currency) to Jiaohe, Jilin, Jiutai, Yueshan City, and inside the customs, to purchase wood ear mushrooms, elm mushrooms, rice, Sichuan peppercorns, rice bowls, chopsticks, apples, calico, and other goods. At the same time, due to limited financial resources and operating conditions, fearing that it would not be able to fully meet the needs of farmers and citizens, it sold flour, white sugar, alkali noodles, peanuts, vermicelli, fresh goods, pork, towels, socks, and other goods on consignment from Songjiang Fuyu Flour Mill, Liaoxi Enterprise Company, Jilin Provincial Public Industrial Supply and Marketing Department, Tianjin Enterprise Company, and other units. And according to the production situation of various New Year goods manufacturing factories in Changchun, it clarified the division of labor and handled the supply and marketing work of New Year goods, so that the state-owned economy and the private economy were closely combined, in order to prevent the tendency of supply and demand imbalance. For example, Changchun’s foreign wax and paper factories can produce foreign wax and red paper. The company then transported a large amount of wax material from other places and sold its finished products on consignment. The Trust Company accepted the experience of a large backlog of peanuts last year, and conducted strict economic accounting and purchase and sales plans before preparing New Year goods this year. In mid-December, it printed and distributed a list of New Year goods quality and prices, which was sent to cooperatives in counties and districts near Changchun to convey to members for ordering. According to statistics from the company’s wholesale and retail departments, as of now, most of the goods have been sold. In the past two months or so, it has sold 120,000 catties of rice, 5,000 bundles of rice bowls, 1,000 catties of star anise, 5,000 pairs of chopsticks, 10,000 bags of flour, 3,000 packages of foreign wax, 120,000 catties of apples, 20,000 catties of vermicelli, 50,000 catties of pork, 2,500 catties of seaweed, and more than 60 other kinds of goods such as wood ear mushrooms, elm mushrooms, small dried shrimp, red paper, New Year pictures, tea bowls, calico, and towels. The total transaction amount reached more than 20 billion, but this is only a preliminary solution to the people's need for New Year goods.

　　满足群众需要交流各地物资
    长春信托公司大量购销年货
    去年农产品普遍丰收，城市工业生产亦多恢复或有发展，广大农民与工人的购买力都已经提高了，因此今年春节人民的需要必然激增。鉴于这种情况，长春信托公司从十一月起就与各公私营企业配合，通过采购、代销、订货等方式准备了大批年货。该公司根据长春地区需要情况首先把年货种类与产地调查清楚，派出采购小组，以七十亿元（东北币、下同），分别到蛟河、吉林、九台、态岳城、关内等地，采购了木耳、元蘑、大米、花椒、饭碗、筷子、苹果、花布等物。同时因资金力量与经营条件所限，恐不能全部满足农民和市民的需要，乃代销松江扶余制粉厂、辽西企业公司、吉林省公营工业供销处、天津企业公司等单位的面粉、白糖、碱面、花生、粉条、鲜货、猪肉、毛巾、袜子等货。并根据长春市各年货制造工厂的生产情况，明确分工，办理年货的供销工作，使国营经济与私营经济密切结合；以防止供求失调的偏向。如长春市洋腊、纸厂能生产洋腊与红纸，该公司即由外地运来大批腊料，并为其代销成品。信托公司接受了去年积压大批花生的经验，在今年准备年货前即进行了严格的经济核算与购销计划。十二月中旬印发年货质量价格表，送给长春附近各县区合作社转达社员订购。据本公司批发零售部门统计，截至目前止，各货已大部销出，计两个多月来已销出大米十二万斤，饭碗五千轴，大料一千斤，筷子五千把，面粉一万袋，洋腊三千包，苹果十二万斤，粉条两万斤，猪肉五万斤，海菜二千五百斤，其他有木耳、元蘑、小海米、红纸、年画、茶碗、花布、毛巾等六十多种货物，交易总额达二百多个亿，但这还仅仅是初步解决了人民对年货的需要。
