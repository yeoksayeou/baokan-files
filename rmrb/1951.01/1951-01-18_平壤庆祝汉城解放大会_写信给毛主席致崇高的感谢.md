Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 17th: The people of Pyongyang held a mass rally on January 5th of this year to celebrate the liberation of Seoul and passed a letter of thanks to Chairman Mao Zedong. The full text is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people:

Today, as we gather in Pyongyang to hold a celebration rally for the liberation of our country's capital and cultural center, Seoul, thanks to the offensive of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, we extend to you our highest gratitude and honor. The American bandits, attempting to turn our country into a colony and enslave our nation, occupied our capital, Seoul. This period was a time of indescribable misfortune and humiliation for our nation. The enemy destroyed and trampled upon our culture, which has a history of five thousand years, and destroyed and plundered the factories, enterprises, schools, hospitals, and residences built by our people with their blood and sweat, turning the streets of Seoul into ashes. Moreover, they committed the inhuman atrocities of massacring and humiliating countless of our brothers and sisters. We must take revenge and relentlessly annihilate the enemy.

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong: We, the Korean people, are determined to rise up as one to defend Seoul, liberated from the enemy's occupation, restore the destroyed order, and do our utmost to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. We vow to further strengthen the eternal friendship with the Chinese people. We wish you—the great leader of the Chinese people—a long life!

　　平壤庆祝汉城解放大会
    写信给毛主席致崇高的感谢
    【新华社十七日讯】平壤讯：平壤市各界人民于今年一月五日举行庆祝汉城解放的群众大会时，曾通过致毛泽东主席的感谢信。全文如下：中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席：
    今天为了庆祝我们祖国的首都和文化中心——汉城由于英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的进攻而重获解放，聚集在平壤市举行庆祝大会的我们，谨向您致以崇高的感谢和荣誉。美国强盗妄图将我们的祖国变为殖民地，奴役我们民族，而侵占了我国首都汉城。这个时期，是我们民族遭到难以形容的不幸和侮辱的时期。敌人破坏和蹂躏了我国具有五千年悠久历史的文化，破坏和掠夺了我们人民用血汗建设起来的工厂、企业、学校、医院和住宅，使汉城的街道变成灰烬。不仅如此，他们更犯下了屠杀和凌辱我们无数兄弟姊妹的惨无人道的暴行。我们一定要报仇，一定要无情地歼灭敌人。
    敬爱的毛泽东主席：我们朝鲜人民决心一致奋起保卫从敌人的侵占下获得解放的汉城，恢复被破坏的秩序，竭力展开支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的工作。我们宣誓，一定要进一步加强和中国人民永恒的友谊。祝您——中国人民的伟大领袖万寿无疆！
