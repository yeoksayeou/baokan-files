　　Yilin County, Shandong Province, Organizes Public Granary for Famine Relief

    Yilin County, Shandong Province, suffered a major famine the year before last, while last year was a year of good harvest. In order to store grain for famine relief, the county people's government convened a representative meeting of people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about welfare undertakings in late November last year, and established a county public granary management committee. After the meeting, each township held symposiums to discuss and publicize the benefits of running public granaries, and established township public granary management committees. By the end of December last year, a total of 23,229 households in the county had voluntarily donated 213,053 jin of grain. All of this grain is owned by the public granary.
    The measures for the public granary are: (1) In times of famine, it is used to relieve disaster victims; (2) In normal years, it can be lent to poorer farmers at low interest in the spring to benefit production. As long as it is guaranteed to be returned on time, it can be circulated continuously; (3) In years of good harvest, this reserve grain can be used in a planned way to carry out welfare undertakings, such as repairing bridges and roads; (4) It can also be used to adjust supplies in neighboring areas in case of disasters. In order to prevent illegal acts such as embezzlement and self-enrichment, except when it is used in accordance with the above regulations and approved by the leading organs of each township and the county government before it can be used, it shall not be used in other circumstances. The masses reflected: "If we had this method earlier, we wouldn't have suffered so much in the famine last year!" "Take a handful in good years, so you don't have no way in famine years!" "The government led us through the famine, and in good years it leads us to run public granaries for famine relief. It really thinks about the people in a thoughtful way."
    I think: the establishment of public granaries can also be promoted in other places.

### 山东益临县举办义仓备荒年

　　山东益临县举办义仓备荒年
    山东益临县前年闹了大灾荒，而去年则是丰年。县人民政府为了积谷备荒，于去年十一月下旬召开了各界热心于福利事业人士的代表会议，并成立了县义仓保管委员会。会后各乡都召开了座谈会，讨论和宣传举办义仓的好处，成立各乡义仓保管委员会。全县至去年十二月底止，共有两万三千二百二十九户，自动捐献粮食二十一万三千零五十三斤。这些粮食统归义仓。
    义仓的办法是：（一）遇荒年时，用于救济灾民；（二）一般年景可以在春天低利借贷给较贫困的农民，以利生产。只要保证到期归还，就可以周转不息；（三）丰年时可以有计划的利用该项备荒粮，办理福利事业，如修桥补路等；（四）如邻区有灾荒时，也可用以调剂。为了防止贪污自肥等不法行为，除按上项规定动用时由各乡领导机关呈请区县政府批准方得动用外，其他情况不得动用。群众反映：“如果早有这个办法，去年灾荒就不受那个罪了！”“好年拿一把，免得荒年没办法！”“政府领导咱们度过了灾荒，丰年又领导咱们举办义仓备荒，这真是为人民想的周到。”
    我想：举办义仓，在其他各地也可以推广。
