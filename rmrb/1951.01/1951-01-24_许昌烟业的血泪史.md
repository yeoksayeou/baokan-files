The Bloody History of the Xuchang Tobacco Industry
    Zhang Jiezong

　　"The shad of Fuyang River, the tea of Fuyang Mountain, selling my children for the fat fish, ruining my family for the famous tea. Tea-picking women, fishermen, officials torture and plunder them all." This is a poem by Han Bangqi of the Ming Dynasty describing the suffering of the people in special product areas under the feudal rule of the Ming Dynasty. Not only in the Ming Dynasty, but throughout China's past thousands of years of feudal society, the vast majority of people lived extremely painful lives due to the extremely cruel feudal oppression and exploitation by the feudal aristocratic landlord class. In the last hundred years, the most ferocious imperialism has been added. Under the combined rule of imperialism and feudal forces, the suffering of the Chinese people has been more intense, heavier, and more painful. Under the economic plunder of imperialism, the people in China's special product areas were the first to be persecuted most deeply.

　　The Xuchang area has fertile soil rich in natural fertilizers such as phosphorus, potassium, and calcium, making it most suitable for growing tobacco. Since tobacco cultivation began in the late nineteenth century, the production area has gradually expanded, and the number of tobacco farmers has gradually increased. Today, it includes more than ten counties, including Xuchang, Xiangxian, Jiaxian, Yuxian, Changge, Yanling, and Linying, with an annual planting area of nearly one million mu and hundreds of thousands of tobacco farmers. The yield is abundant, with an annual output of about 100 million jin. The quality is excellent, and it is famous at home and abroad. Most of it is distributed with Xuchang City as a gathering place. However, such abundant and excellent special products, under the plunder of American imperialism, brought not happiness but blood and tears and disaster to the people.

　　In 1917, American and British imperialists established the British American Tobacco Company in Xuchang as a blood-sucking institution for plundering the Chinese people. A little later, the famous overseas Chinese national capitalists, the Jian Yujie and Jian Zhaonan brothers, also established the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company in Xuchang. However, in order to deceive farmers, squeeze out China's national industry and commerce, and monopolize and manipulate all the tobacco in the Xuchang area, the treacherous American and British imperialists began to deliberately raise tobacco prices very high every year before farmers planted tobacco, raising them to 48 cents per jin of tobacco leaves (equivalent to about a dozen jin of wheat at the time). Two years later, it crushed the Nanyang Brothers Company, which had little capital. Thus, the American and British imperialists achieved a complete monopoly on all profits from the special tobacco products in Xuchang. Since then, it has deepened its exploitation of Chinese farmers. In the past two years, due to the deceptive propaganda and deceptive price increases of the American and British imperialists, farmers in more than a dozen counties around Xuchang planted tobacco on all or most of their land, and even borrowed money to buy tobacco seeds, fertilize, and buy coal to bake tobacco. Many farmers relied on selling tobacco leaves to buy grain for their entire family throughout the year. After the new tobacco came down this year, the British American Tobacco Company kept its doors tightly closed for several months, refusing to buy tobacco leaves. Under its manipulation, millions of people in more than a dozen counties near Xuchang were truly in dire straits and unable to live. In a village called Gan Guo Li in the south of Xuchang City, there was a farmer named Mao Fushun whose family of six cultivated a total of twelve mu of land. This year, they planted eight mu of tobacco leaves. At the beginning, except for Mao Fushun, the whole family did not agree with planting so much tobacco, believing that "American devils are unreliable." But under Mao Fushun's insistence, they had to plant it this way. After the tobacco was harvested and baked, none of it could be sold, and the whole family had no means of living. One day, when there was no rice or noodles left, Mao Fushun asked his daughter-in-law to cook. The daughter-in-law, in extreme difficulty with no way to borrow or beg, was somewhat angry with her father-in-law and cooked a pot of tobacco leaves. At mealtime, Mao Fushun opened the pot and saw that it was tobacco leaves. Holding a bellyful of grievances, he hanged himself. After Mao Fushun's death, his daughter-in-law, because she was beaten badly by her husband and rebuked by her neighbors, also hanged herself on the third day. Her husband watched his father die, his wife also die, and soon also committed suicide by jumping into a well. Of the six people in the family, only a frail old woman and two young orphans were left. This is a tragic picture under the plunder of American and British imperialists.

　　That winter, American and British imperialist elements, seeing that the opportunity to make huge profits had matured, announced that they would start buying tobacco. Beforehand, running dogs were sent to various places to promote it. The farmers, who were in extreme straits, thought this was good news. Tobacco farmers from more than a dozen counties around Xuchang, hundreds of miles away in the far reaches, and tens of miles away nearby, carried it on their backs, with shoulder poles, pushed it in small carts, and pulled it in large carts, all came to Xuchang to sell tobacco. There were more than a thousand vehicles alone. The American and British imperialists, according to their predetermined vicious blood-drinking plan, deliberately claimed that the funds had not arrived, or that the technicians had not returned, and postponed the weighing day after day. Under the triple oppression of imperialist, feudal forces and bureaucratic capital, who could afford travel expenses or endure long-term waiting, among the poor Chinese farmers who came to sell tobacco? More than a thousand vehicles, people, and livestock all slept in the open air in the square at night. On one snowy night, fourteen people and fifty-two cattle and donkeys were frozen to death. This is a huge blood debt owed to us by American imperialists.

　　The British American Tobacco Company finally opened the scales, but the price was suppressed especially low, falling from 48 cents per pound to 8 cents per pound. The best tobacco leaves were given 8 cents per pound, bad tobacco 3 cents per pound, and the worst was only 1.5 cents. The weighing was done using a 15-tael big pound. Most of the honest Chinese farmers only knew it was a "foreign scale," who knew what a "pound" was, who knew how much a pound was? When weighing tobacco, the quality depended only on what the American devils said. If the farmers disagreed, the fierce American devils would smash the tobacco on the ground, smashing it to pieces. Sometimes they would push people to the ground and arbitrarily beat and insult them with guns or wooden sticks. The farmers worked hard for a year, and the hope that their entire family's life depended on resulted in selling money that was not enough for the price of coal for baking tobacco, not enough to repay debts. The American and British imperialists were cunning and vicious, and they knew that the result of such cruel exploitation would stifle the source of their exploitation. After they had almost finished buying tobacco, they deliberately raised the tobacco price slightly to stimulate farmers to plant tobacco. Thus, good tobacco was raised to 23 cents a pound, medium tobacco 18 cents, and bad tobacco less than 10 cents. But here they still used deceptive means. There were three fixed pounds for the three price levels, but the position of the pounds was ostensibly fixed but actually not fixed. The three pounds secretly switched positions. Farmers vied to put good tobacco on the pound with the good price to weigh, but the pound changed, and often the same good tobacco from the farmers sold for different prices. The imperialists secretly had a price list, and in short, they wanted to keep the average price of all tobacco no more than 15 cents per pound.

　　In 1927, after the flames of the Great Revolution burned to Xuchang, the farmers, under extreme hatred, set fire to the British American Tobacco Company. The fire burned for more than a month, preventing it from recovering quickly. After the "April 12th" incident, American imperialism again attempted to restore its economic aggression institution in Xuchang—the British American Tobacco Company, but it was strongly opposed by the people of Xuchang. Originally, the land occupied by the British American Tobacco Company in Xuchang was stolen from the name of Ren Boyan of Shanghai Yong'an Company. Xuchang had no foreign concession in the past, nor was land sold to foreigners. The people of Xuchang had repeatedly filed joint lawsuits, not allowing the American and British imperialists to set up this blood-sucking institution here again; however, the imperialists bribed Xu Yaping, the pseudo-Henan Fifth Administrative Commissioner, with 20,000 silver dollars, and Chen Bozhu, the pseudo-secret of the special commissioner's office, with 8,000 silver dollars. Under the strict suppression of the reactionary Kuomintang local government, American imperialists used the compradore Wu Tingsheng to come forward and start setting up a factory to buy tobacco in the name of the Xuchang Tobacco Company, still habitually following the old tricks of cruel plunder. During this stage when the British American Tobacco Company was burned down, the tobacco factories of the national bourgeoisie in the Ninghu area sent merchants to Xuchang to buy tobacco. At that time, more than forty tobacco shops and thirty-odd transport companies sprang up in Xuchang City. However, after the American imperialists began to buy tobacco again, they re-implemented monopoly manipulation. Originally, farmers had to pay a 4% commission to private tobacco shops for selling tobacco, plus other exorbitant taxes and levies from the Kuomintang, and the farmers themselves paid more than 6%. The American imperialists declared that they bought and collected tobacco themselves, without commission, so the farmers naturally wanted to sell tobacco in their factory, which again caused all the more than forty tobacco shops to collapse and most of the thirty-odd transport companies to close down. At the same time, the American imperialists carried out further plunder, extending the Pinghan Railway to their courtyard, causing more than a thousand transport workers who lived by pushing tobacco bales to lose their jobs. This really aroused the resentment of the broad masses of Xuchang. In March 1935, the people of Xuchang beat Wu Tingsheng, the running dog of American imperialism, to death in Xiguan. In the spring of the following year, they beat Niu Shen, the executioner of American imperialism who directly slaughtered the Chinese people, to death in the courtyard of the British American Tobacco Company.

　　American imperialists wanted to monopolize China's entire cigarette industry and stifle China's economy. In 1932, the British American Tobacco Company bought out all of the national machine-made cigarette tax from the Kuomintang traitorous government for 50 million yuan. That is to say, in addition to the existing cigarette factories, Chinese people were not allowed to set up another cigarette factory on their own national territory. Originally, Xuchang had so many excellent tobacco leaves, and the cigarette industry had a good development prospect by using local materials, but it was monopolized by American and British imperialists. In 1932, a businessman named Wang set up the first cigarette machine in Xuchang, but it had to be produced in secret. When working, they also had to patrol and watch out, and everyone would jump over the wall and hide as soon as there was any movement. But in the end, they could not escape the vicious American devils and their running dogs. Half a year later, it was finally discovered. The American devils used the Kuomintang reactionary regime to detain the manager, confiscate the raw materials, spices, and all the furniture, and never allow work to start again. Later, the factory adopted guerrilla management methods, moving to the countryside to start work. In a few years, it moved from Fanpo to Shigu, from Shigu to Fancheng, from Fancheng to Jiucheng, and from Jiucheng back to Fancheng. It was discovered twice and suffered huge fines of more than 4,000 yuan. Mr. Wang Jieting, the manager, almost died of serious illness due to this persecution.

　　In 1937, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japan occupied the big cities along the coast, and the source of foreign cigarettes was cut off. The British American Tobacco Company also withdrew in 1938. Only then could the tobacco leaves of the Xuchang special product area be truly used by the Chinese people, giving full play to the potential of Chinese industry. For a time, cigarette factories were generally established throughout Henan Province. The Huiguo Town of Xuchang, Xiangxian, Yexian, Yanling, Gongxian, and the Yuantan Town of Tanghe were all concentrated areas of cigarette factories. It is estimated that there are more than 300 large and small machine-made cigarette factories in Henan Province, and there are more than 70 in Xuchang alone. Cigarettes were sold to Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces, as far as Dihua in Xinjiang Province. However, after the Japanese surrender, Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism signed the "Sino-US Commercial Treaty," and American cigarettes were dumped in large quantities throughout the country. Under the reactionary rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, how could these national industries and businesses with little capital compete with the large monopoly capital of the United States? All the cigarette factories in Henan Province quickly collapsed again. Only the dying Tongchang, Taihe, and Huatong companies were left in the seventy-odd cigarette factories in Xuchang. It was not until the Liberation Army crossed the river in 1948 and the entire territory of Henan was liberated that the cigarette factories in various places were able to resume and develop normally one after another.

　　许昌烟业的血泪史
    张节中
    “富阳江之鲥，富阳山之茶，鱼肥卖我子，茶名破我家。采茶妇，捕鱼夫，官府拷掠无完肤。”这是明人韩邦奇描写在明代封建统治下特产区人民痛苦情形的一首诗。不仅明代，在中国过去几千年的封建社会，由于封建贵族地主阶级极残酷的封建压迫和剥削，广大人民一直过着极惨痛的生活。近百年来又加上个最凶恶的帝国主义。在帝国主义和封建势力结合统治，中国人民的痛苦则是更剧烈更沉重更惨痛。在帝国主义的经济劫夺下，遭到迫害最深的，首先是中国特产区的人民。
    许昌地区，土质肥沃，土壤中富于磷钾钙等天然的肥料，最适于种植烟草。自十九世纪末开始种烟后，产区逐渐扩大，烟农逐渐增多。现今包括许昌、襄县、郏县、禹县、长葛、鄢陵、临颍等十余县，每年植烟面积近百万亩，植烟农民数十万户。产量丰富，年产一万万斤左右。品质优良，驰名中外。大都以许昌市为集散地。但是这样丰富而优良的特产，在美帝国主义掠夺下，带给人民的不是幸福，而是血泪和灾难。
    一九一七年美英帝国主义者在许昌设立了英美烟草公司，作为掠夺中国人民的吸血机构。稍迟南洋华侨中国著名的民族资本家简玉阶、简照南兄弟也在许昌设立南洋兄弟烟草公司。但是奸恶的美英帝国主义者为了欺骗农民，挤垮中国的民族工商业，垄断和操纵许昌地区的全部烟草，在南洋兄弟烟草公司设立后，在每年农民种烟前，开始故意将烟价提得很高，提至每斤烟叶四毛八分钱（合当时物价约可买十几斤麦子）。二年后，便把资本微小的南洋兄弟公司摧垮了。于是美英帝国主义者达到了独占许昌特产烟草的全部利润。此后，它更加深对中国农民的剥削。两年来，由于美英帝国主义者的欺骗宣传和欺骗提价，许昌周围十几县农民，有的将全部土地或大部土地种烟叶，甚至借债购买烟籽，施肥，买煤烤烟，许多农民全家全年都依靠卖烟叶购粮生活。这年新烟下来后，英美烟草公司都一连几个月紧紧闭门不收烟叶。许昌附近十几县数百万人民在它的操纵下，真是困苦万状，无法生活。在许昌城南一个叫做干郭李的村庄，有一个农民叫毛福顺，全家六口人共种十二亩地。这一年栽种了八亩烟叶。种这样多的烟，开始时除毛福顺外，全家都不赞同，认为“美国鬼子是靠不住的”。但是在毛福顺的坚持下，就只有这样种了。烟收好烤好后，一点卖不出去，全家生活无着。一天在米没面净的情况下，毛福顺叫媳妇做饭。媳妇在借讨无门极端困难中，有些与公公赌气，将锅内煮了一锅烟叶。吃饭时，毛福顺掀开锅盖一看是烟叶，抱着一肚子怨气便上吊自尽了。在毛福顺死后，他的媳妇因为受到丈夫的痛打和邻人的斥责，也在第三日自缢身死。她的丈夫眼看着自己的父亲死了，妻子也死了，不久也投井自杀。全家六口人，结果只剩下一个残弱的老婆两个年幼的孤儿。这是在美英帝国主义者的劫夺下的一幅悲惨图画。
    这年冬天，美英帝国主义分子，看到获得暴利的机会已经成熟。宣布开始收烟，事前各地派出走狗宣传。正在极端困迫下的农民，认为这是一个喜讯。许昌周围十余县烟农，远者数百里，近者数十里，背的，挑的，小车推的，大车拉的，都来许昌卖烟，仅车辆就有一千多辆。美英帝国主义者按其预定的毒恶的喝血计划，故意推说款子没到，或者技师没回来，一天一天推延不开磅。在帝国主义封建势力官僚资本三重压迫下，来卖烟的穷苦的中国农民，谁能带几个路费，怎样熬得起长期的等待。一千多辆车、人和牲畜，夜间都露宿在广场上。一个大雪的夜里，就冻死十四条人命，五十二头牛和驴。这是美帝国主义者欠下我们的一笔巨大的血债。
    英美烟草公司终于开磅了，但是，把价钱压得特别低，每磅从四角八分钱跌到了八分钱，最好的烟叶每磅给八分钱，坏烟每磅仅三分钱，最坏的是一分半。称烟又是用的十五两大磅，老实的中国农民，大部只知道是“洋称”，谁知道“磅”，谁知一磅是多少？称烟时好坏只凭美国鬼子一句话，农民稍有不同意，凶恶的美国鬼子，便将烟摔到地下，摔得粉碎。有时将人推倒在地，随意用枪或木棍毒打、辱骂。农民辛苦一年，全家全年生活所依托的希望，结果所卖的钱不够烤烟的煤价，不够还债。美英帝国主义者是狡猾毒辣的，它知道这样残酷剥削的结果，将会窒息它的剥削源泉。在它收烟收到差不多后，又故意将烟价再稍微提高，刺激农民种烟。于是好烟便提到两毛三分钱一磅，中等的一毛八分，坏的不到一毛钱。但是在这里它还是用的欺骗手段。三等价钱有三个固定的磅，但磅的位置明着固定而实际是不固定的，三个磅暗中转换位置，农民争着将好烟放在好价格的磅上称，但磅更换了，往往农民同样的好烟，卖的价钱不同。帝国主义者暗中有一个价谱，总之它要把全部烟的平均价格每磅不超过一毛五分钱。
    一九二七年，大革命的火焰燃烧到许昌后，在农民极端痛恨之下，便一把火把英美烟草公司点起来烧了，大火整整烧了一个多月，使它不能很快的恢复。“四一二”后，美帝国主义又企图在许昌恢复它的经济侵略机构——英美烟草公司，但是遭到了许昌地方人民强烈的反对。本来英美烟草公司在许昌所占的地皮是从上海永安公司任伯言的名下盗用的，许昌过去没有外国租界，也不卖给外国人土地，许昌人民曾经数次联名控告，不让英美帝国主义者在这里再设立这个吸血机构；但是帝国主义者用两万块现洋贿赂伪河南第五行政专员徐亚平，八千元现洋贿赂伪专署秘书长陈伯翥，在反动的国民党地方政府严密镇压下，美帝国主义者利用大买办邬廷生出头，以许昌烟草公司的名义又开始设厂买烟，仍惯袭过去残酷掠夺的故技。在英美烟草公司被烧毁的这个阶段，宁沪一带的民族资产阶级烟厂派出的坐商已在许昌收烟，当时许市兴起了四十几家烟行，三十几家转运公司。但是美帝开始重新收烟后，又重新进行垄断操纵。本来农民在私人烟行卖烟要出四分行佣，再加国民党的其它苛捐杂税，农民自己所出者在六分以上。美帝国主义者宣称他们自买自收，不要佣钱，农民自然要到他们厂内去卖烟，这样又使四十几家烟行全部垮台，三十几家转运公司大部歇业。同时，美帝国主义又进行进一步的掠夺，将平汉铁路延修到他们院内，使一千多个靠推烟包生活的搬运工人全部失业。这实在激起了许昌广大群众的忿恨，一九三五年三月，许昌人民将美帝国主义的走狗邬廷生打死在西关内，第二年春天又将美帝国主义直接屠杀中国人民的刽子手牛申打死在英美烟草公司的院内。
    美帝国主义者想垄断中国的全部卷烟业，窒息中国的经济。一九三二年英美烟草公司从国民党卖国政府手里，将全国的机器卷烟税用五千万元全部包了。也就是说除现有的烟厂外，不许中国人在自己祖国国土上再设立一家卷烟厂。本来许昌有这样多优美的烟叶，就地取材，卷烟业有很好的发展前途，但是却垄断在美英帝国主义者的手里。一九三二年一位姓王的工商业者，在许昌设立第一架卷烟机，但是却要在秘密的情况下进行生产。工作时还要巡风放哨，一有动静大家翻墙躲开。但终于逃不过毒辣的美国鬼子和他的走狗。半年后，终于被发觉了，美国鬼子利用国民党反动政权将经理扣起来，原料、香料及所有家具全部没收，并永远不许开工。以后该厂采取打游击的经营方法，搬到农村去开工，几年间从范坡移到石固，从石固移到繁城，从繁城移到纠城，又从纠城回到繁城，先后又被发觉两次，遭受四千元以上的巨额罚款。经理王杰亭先生，因受这种迫害，几乎重病致死。
    一九三七年，抗日战争发生后，日本占领了沿海一带的大城市，外烟断绝来源。英美烟草公司也于一九三八年撤走。许昌特产地区的烟叶，这时才算真正为中国人应用了，发挥了中国工业的潜力。一时河南全境普遍立起烟厂，许昌、襄县、叶县、鄢陵、巩县的回廓镇、唐河的源潭镇都是烟厂的集中地。估计河南全省大小机器卷烟厂在三百家以上，仅许昌一地就有七十余家，纸烟销售于湖北、四川、陕西、甘肃等省，远达新疆省的迪化。但是日寇投降后，蒋介石和美帝国主义订立了“中美商约”，美烟大量倾销各地。在蒋介石卖国贼的反动统治下，中国这些资本微小的民族工商业，怎能和美帝大垄断资本相竞争，河南全省的烟厂又均迅速垮台，许昌七十几家烟厂仅剩下了奄奄待毙的同昌、太和、华通三家。直到一九四八年解放大军过河，河南全境解放，各地烟厂才得相继正常的恢复和发展。
