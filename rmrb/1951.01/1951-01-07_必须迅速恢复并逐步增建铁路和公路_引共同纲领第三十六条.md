　　Must Quickly Restore and Gradually Increase the Construction of Railways and Highways
    Quoting Article 36 of the Common Program
    Two Locomotives on the China Chang Railway Set New National Traction Records
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th] In the "over-axle movement" to strive for locomotives to pull more and run faster, two locomotives on the Northeast China Chang Railway have set new national records. On December 25th of last year, the "Youth" heavy freight locomotive of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot pulled 93 freight cars weighing 4,174 tons over-axle, departing from Daguantun (near Fushun) to Sujiatun (near Shenyang), arriving three minutes ahead of schedule. The traction weight of the locomotive exceeded more than double the Northeast locomotive traction weight standard, setting a new national record. At the same time, the locomotive also saved 561 jin of coal. Following the "Youth" locomotive, the No. 1157 heavy freight locomotive of the same depot broke this record again on New Year's Day by pulling 4,343 tons, setting a new record.
　　Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Chongqing-Jiangjin Section Completes Track Laying Project
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The Chongqing to Jiangjin section (65 kilometers) of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was completed at the end of last December, and a grand trial operation ceremony was held on New Year's Day this year. The trial operation went well. The track laying of this section of the railway started in August last year. The workers worked hard to overcome the lack of experience and various technical difficulties. At the beginning, they could only lay 600 meters of track per day, but in December they created a record of laying 3 kilometers and 160 meters per day.
　　Iron Ox Locomotive Safely Runs 220,000 Kilometers
    [This newspaper] The Iron Ox locomotive, one of the national locomotive banners of the Suihua Locomotive Depot, has reached a safe operating record of 224,363 kilometers. No accidents occurred in the whole year of 1950, and five major and minor accidents were prevented. 127 tons of coal and 940 kilograms of oil were saved throughout the year, and 18,230.1 tons were exceeded in axle load. The Iron Ox locomotive left the factory on August 28, 1949, and took the lead in two Class A inspections. The Class A inspection mileage has now been extended to 124,061 kilometers (according to regulations, a Class A inspection should be carried out after 60,000 kilometers).
    Under the direct help of the old hero Du Xianyang and the leadership of driver Liu Yucai, all crew members of the Iron Ox locomotive created a daily vehicle operation of 500 kilometers in July 1950, and in September, they established economic accounting work based on locomotives as a unit, which quickly spread throughout the Northeast region and became a widespread mass movement, creating huge wealth for the country. As a result of carrying out economic accounting work, the Suihua Locomotive Depot alone saved 8.3 billion yuan for the country in half a year.
    The Iron Ox locomotive successfully passed 1950, and they also formulated a plan for 1951. The plan includes: (1) Maintaining the cylinder life of the locomotive, extending the medium repair to 300,000 kilometers, preventing the cylinder from cracking and the screw stays from breaking; (2) Further improving economic accounting, saving 5% of coal and 10% of oil per 10,000-ton kilometers, and saving 10% of locomotive maintenance costs; (3) Maintaining the quality of the locomotive, preventing the driving wheels from being scratched and the sliding surface of the driving axle from lacking oil; (4) Planned over-axle operation, punctual operation, increasing 500 daily vehicle kilometers, and eliminating any major and minor accidents.

　　Northwest Important Highway Traffic Has Been Restored and Opened to Traffic
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] Over the past year, highway traffic in the Northwest region has been basically restored. According to incomplete statistics, more than 21,000 kilometers of the region's 25,000 kilometers of highways have been opened to traffic. At the time of liberation last year, the important bridges on the three national highways of Xi-Huo (from Xi'an to Horgos, Xinjiang), Hua-Shuang (from Huajialing, Gansu to Shuangshipu, Shaanxi), and Sichuan-Shaanxi were almost completely destroyed by the Hu Ma bandit army. In addition, many roads were in disrepair for a long time, and many bridge culverts were rotten and collapsed. After liberation, the Northwest Highway Bureau began to overhaul the roadbeds and bridge culverts of the above-mentioned highways. As of the end of last year, except for a few more difficult projects, the rest have been completely restored. The important highways of each province have also been overhauled. Important highways in Xinjiang and Gansu have been restored and opened to traffic. Within Shaanxi, 43 bridge culverts have been repaired, more than 4,700 cubic meters of roadbed have been overhauled, and the severely damaged Han (Zhong) Bai (He) highway has also been restored and opened to traffic. After the overhaul of each highway, driving is safer than before, and the volume of material transportation has greatly increased. According to the statistics of the Transportation Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the transportation volume of the national highways in the Northwest in October last year increased by nearly five times compared with February. In addition, as bandits were gradually eliminated in various places and public and private trade organizations purchased large quantities of local products, the furs and mountain products of various ethnic minority areas could be smoothly sold externally, and the supply of industrial products also increased accordingly. Shaanxi's tung oil, lacquer and other local products have found a market due to the opening of transportation.

    引共同纲领第三十六条
    中长路两机车创全国牵引新纪录
    【新华社沈阳五日电】在争取机车拉得多、跑得快的“超轴运动”中，东北中长铁路已有两台机车创造了全国新纪录。去年十二月二十五日苏家屯机务段大型货运机车“青年号”超轴牵引九十三辆货车重四千一百七十四吨，由大官屯（抚顺附近）开往苏家屯（沈阳附近），提前三分钟到达。该机车牵引重量超过东北机车牵引重量标准的一倍以上，创造了全国最新纪录。同时该机车还节省了五百六十一斤煤。继“青年号”机车之后，该段大型货运机车一一五七号又在元旦日以牵引四千三百四十三吨的更新纪录打破了这一纪录。
　　成渝路重庆江津段完成铺轨工程
    【新华社重庆五日电】成渝铁路重庆至江津段（六十五公里）已于去年十二月底完成铺轨工程，并于今年元旦日举行了隆重的试车典礼，试车情形良好。这段铁路的铺轨工程是从去年八月开始的。工人们曾努力克服经验缺乏和各种技术上的困难。开始时他们每天只能铺轨六百公尺，到十二月份却创造了每天铺三公里又一百六十公尺的纪录。
　　铁牛号机车安全运行廿二万公里
    【本报讯】绥化机务段全国机车旗帜之一的铁牛号机车，安全运行纪录已达到二十二万四千三百六十三公里，一九五○年全年未出任何事故，并防止大小事故五件，全年省煤一百二十七吨，省油九百四十公斤，超轴一万八千二百三十零点一吨。铁牛号机车自一九四九年八月二十八日出厂，首创二个甲检期，甲检公里现已延长至十二万四千零六十一公里（按规定，行走六万公里即应进行甲检）。
    铁牛号机车全体乘务员，在老英雄杜先阳的直接帮助及司机长刘玉才的带领下，在一九五○年七月，创立日车运行五百公里，九月，又建立以机车为单位的经济核算工作，并很快在东北区全路展开，成为广泛的群众性运动，为国家创造了巨量财富。由于开展经济核算工作的结果，仅绥化机务段在半年内，就为国家节省了八十三亿元。
    铁牛号机车胜利地度过了一九五○年，他们并订出了一九五一年的计划，计划内容是：（一）保养机车缸部寿命，延长中修达三十万公里，缸部不龟裂，螺撑不折损；（二）进一步作好经济核算，每万吨公里省煤百分之五，省油百分之十，机车维修费节省百分之十；（三）保养机车质量，动轮不擦伤，动轴摺动面不缺油；（四）有计划的超轴，正点运行，提高五百日车公里，消灭任何大小事故。

　　西北重要公路交通均已修复通车
    【新华社西安四日电】一年来，西北地区公路交通已基本上恢复。据不完全统计，全区二万五千公里公路中，已有二万一千多公里通车。在去年解放时，西霍（自西安至新疆霍城）、华双（自甘肃华家岭至陕西双石铺）、川陕三条国道上的重要桥梁，几全被胡马匪军破坏，加之各路年久失修，桥梁涵洞多腐朽倒塌。解放后西北公路局开始对上述公路进行整修路基和桥梁涵洞的工程。截至去年年底为止，除个别比较困难的工程外，其余已全部修复。各省的重要公路，也都进行了整修。新疆和甘肃境内的重要公路已修复通车。陕西境内公路修复了桥梁涵洞四十三处，整修了路基四千七百多方，破坏很厉害的汉（中）白（河）公路也已修复通车。各公路经过整修后，行车较前安全，物资运输量大为增加。据西北军政委员会交通部的统计，西北各国道去年十月份的运输量比二月份增加了将近五倍。再加各地逐渐肃清了土匪以及公私贸易机关大量收购土产，各少数民族地区的皮毛、山货等得以顺畅外销，工业品供应量也随之增加。陕西的桐油、漆等土产，即因交通打开有了销路。
