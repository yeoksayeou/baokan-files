Voice of the Readers, from Mr. Shen Zhifang's letter:
　　"Recently, I saw in the market a kind of 'Images of Military and Political Leaders of the People's Republic of China,' printed by Shanghai Changchun Picture Company. These images are all painted in a ridiculous and unsightly manner. I am afraid other companies are also printing such portraits. I think such ridiculous portraits are really undesirable. I hope the publishers and distributors will stop printing and selling them."
    Mr. Li Mufang from Zunhua County, Hebei Province, wrote:
　　"Recently, a calendar seller came to Zunhua city. According to him, his calendar was published and distributed by Xuanwutang of Damochang, Beijing. There are many problems with the content of this calendar. The first page is a blurry image of Chairman Mao; it also includes images of other leaders of the Central People's Government, all of which are unclear. In addition, it is full of feudal and superstitious content. I feel it is inappropriate to print the leaders' images together with these feudal superstitious things, and the printing quality is also so poor. I suggest that relevant authorities set certain standards for the printing and publishing of leader images and great people's images by all bookstores, and pay attention to inspection at any time to avoid bad influences. I suggest that the publisher stop selling this Xuanwutang calendar."

    Editor's note: The opinions of the above two readers are very good. We hope that the publishers and vendors of these picture books and calendars will consciously and automatically stop printing and selling them, and recover these publications opposed by the people as much as possible. At the same time, we hope that the publishing administrative authorities will take appropriate steps to solve these two problems and prevent similar incidents from happening.
    Mr. Shi Cheng's letter:
　　"The book *Modern Chinese Economic Society*, published by Shanghai Tangdi Publishing House and written by Jia Zhifang, states in the preface that it is based on Ki no Koto Hirase's *Modern Economic History of China*, but the arguments are the author's own views. In fact, this is completely incorrect. Not only does the book not contain the author's opinions, but it is completely translated from Hirase's original work, and there are many translation errors. I compared the original work of Hirase, which is kept in the Chinese Economic History Research Office of Peking University, with Jia's work and found that even the table of contents has not been changed at all, but was simply copied. The author's dishonest practice shown in this example is not good. But in the case of this book, this is still relatively secondary. More importantly: the original work is fundamentally incorrect in terms of organization and viewpoint, and Mr. Jia Zhifang is willing to bear the responsibility that "the views and arguments of this book have nothing to do with Mr. Hirase," and also stated in the "Preface" that it was written "from the perspective of modern Chinese people," which is inappropriate."

专栏：读者之声

　　读者之声沈芷芳君来信：
    “最近我在市上看到有一种“中华人民共和国军政领袖委员像”，是上海长春画片公司印制的。这些像都画得不伦不类，太不象样。别家印制这种画像的恐怕还有。我以为象这种不伦不类的画像实在要不得，希望出版者、经售者停印停售。”河北遵化县李慕芳君来信：
    “最近遵化城里来了一个卖历书的，据他说：他的历书是北京打磨厂宣武堂出版发行的。这历书内容有好些问题。第一页是毛主席像，模糊一片；还印上了中央人民政府其他领袖的像，也都是眉目不清。此外，全是一些封建迷信的东西。我觉得把领袖像和这些封建迷信的东西印在一起，是不妥当的，并且又印得这样坏。我建议有关机关对一切书铺的印刷出版领袖像、伟人像要定出一定的规格，并随时注意检查，以免发生坏的影响。宣武堂这本历书，我建议请出版者停止发卖。”                                                    
    编者按：上面两位读者的意见都是很好的。我们希望这些画片与历书的出版者和贩卖者都自觉自动地停印停售，并尽可能收回这些为人民所反对的出版物。同时，希望出版行政机关注意采取适当的步骤解决这两个问题，并防止同类事件的发生。史城君来信：
    “上海棠棣出版社出版、贾植芳著：《近代中国经济社会》一书，著者在该书序上虽说系自日本平濑己之告著“近代支那经济史”取材，而论点则是著者自己的见解云云，其实这话完全是不对的。因该书非但并无著者意见在内，是完全根据平濑原著翻译过来，并且译错的地方还很多。我曾把北京大学中国经济史研究室所存的一本平濑原著和贾著对照，发觉甚至连目次都未曾丝毫更改过，照样地搬来了。这一事例所表现的作者不老实的做法是不好的。但是就这一本书论，这还是比较次要的。更重要的是：原著不论在组织与观点各方面，基本上都是不正确的，而贾植芳先生却愿意承担“本书之观点及论点与平濑氏无涉”的责任，并且还在“前言”中说明“系以现代中国人民观点”来写的，这是不妥当的。
