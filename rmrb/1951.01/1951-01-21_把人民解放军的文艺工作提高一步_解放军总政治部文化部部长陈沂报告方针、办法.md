　　Take the People's Liberation Army's Literary and Artistic Work to the Next Level
    Minister Chen Yi of the PLA General Political Department's Cultural Department Reports on Guidelines and Methods

    Chen Yi, Minister of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a report on "Taking the Literary and Artistic Work of the People's Liberation Army to the Next Level" at the All-Army Propaganda, Education, and Cultural Work Conference on December 17th last year. The following is a summary of the report:

    The report first pointed out that literary and artistic work is an important part of the People's Liberation Army's political work—the ideological part of the work. The literary and artistic work of the People's Liberation Army has inherited and implemented the resolution of the Gutian Conference of the Fourth Red Army and has grown, developed, and strengthened under the general direction of Chairman Mao's instruction that "literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers." During the four years of the Liberation War, the literary and artistic workers of the People's Liberation Army, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great thought, participated in the war and fought heroically, some even being wounded or sacrificed. Through their works—especially dramas, news reports, military photography, and military newsreels—they reflected the war, motivated the masses, and reformed prisoners of war, becoming a powerful assistant and important component of wartime political work and the development of mass work in new areas. This kind of literary and artistic work has begun to penetrate into the broad masses of soldiers, combining with their combat life, their love of literature and art, and their talents, thus giving rise to mass literary and artistic activities such as "soldiers acting as soldiers," "soldiers writing about soldiers," "soldiers singing about soldiers," "soldiers painting soldiers," and "soldiers dancing as soldiers." This kind of activity, whether in peacetime or on the front lines and in the trenches, plays a significant role in boosting morale. For example, during the Huaihai Campaign, the activities of the troop art troupes were completely integrated with combat actions on the front lines. When pursuing the enemy and fighting tanks, the art troupe members would sing fast-paced ballads to boost morale. Some even helped soldiers hold celebration meetings in the trenches and helped soldiers write in the trenches.

    The report went on to say that although various literary and artistic works of the People's Liberation Army still have some shortcomings in terms of artistic level, they all reflect or solve ideological problems in the troops. During the four years of the Liberation War, the First Field Army created more than 2,000 "soldiers acting as soldiers" works; the Fourth Field Army published 6.2 million words of literary and artistic works; the Second Field Army published 40 kinds of literary and artistic series and 18 issues of literary and artistic publications; in addition, the Third Field Army and the North China and Northeast Military Regions also published their own literary and artistic series and literary and artistic publications. Most of these works were written by writers trained by the troops, including deputy political commissars of the army, ministers, section chiefs, instructors, political instructors, combat heroes, and war correspondents. Their works all touched on certain ideological issues. For example, the First Field Army's "Hero Liu Si'hu" sings the heroic deeds of the lone hero Liu Si'hu who single-handedly charged into the enemy's formation to resolve the battle; the Second Field Army's "Wang Keqin Class" addresses the issue of mutual assistance in the troops; the Third Field Army's "Storm on the Sea" writes about the great spirit of the troops in overcoming serious difficulties; the Fourth Field Army's "Yang Yong's Merit" writes about the transformation of backward soldiers. The Northeast's "How a Shell is Made" addresses the issue of how veteran cadres accept new things when entering the city; North China's "Growing in Battle" writes about continuing to maintain the glorious traditions of our army. Other paintings, songs, dances, and short news reports are mostly related to the thoughts, combat life, and studies of the broad masses of commanders and fighters. In this way, many simple and ordinary things, after being compiled and performed by soldiers, can play a role in boosting morale, explaining policies, connecting with the masses, and achieving victory.

    The report further analyzed the reasons for obtaining these achievements. The report said: Because the People's Liberation Army is waging a just war, every commander and fighter understands why the war is being waged and whose interests are being defended. This consciousness gradually increased with the progress and victory of the war, so it can overcome many non-proletarian ideas that violate Mao Zedong's strategic thought, and culminate in a revolutionary new heroism. The literary and artistic workers of the troops are members of this revolutionary new heroism, so their works, regardless of their maturity, take reflecting and creating revolutionary new heroism as their subject matter. The war also tempered the literary and artistic workers; the leaders of the troops also gave the literary and artistic workers tremendous help and encouragement, enabling their work to gradually progress. In addition, the hard-working spirit of the literary and artistic workers themselves has also made a significant contribution to the achievements of the literary and artistic work of the troops.

    After affirming the above achievements, the report pointed out that there are still some shortcomings in the current literary and artistic work of the troops. The most important shortcoming is that the ideological and artistic qualities of the works are not high enough, and the class viewpoint of the writers is not clear enough, so they are not prominent enough in depicting revolutionary new heroism. So far, it has not been possible to perfectly create some heroic figures who are famous and admired throughout the army to play a leading role. According to the history of heroic struggles of the entire army and the heroic deeds and heroic figures that have emerged in the struggles, there are many materials available for us to write and perform, but our writers and actors generally only touch and reflect the surface of the problem, and have not been able to delve into the essence of the problem. As a result, our literary and artistic work still lags behind the development of the war and the progress of the troops.

    The emergence of these shortcomings is due to the fact that the literary and artistic workers of the troops in the past were in frequent and tense battles, often having to "catch up with tasks," and could only "write and perform whatever they encountered," without being able to pay attention to improving from the existing level. Not only writing about the front, but also writing about the rear; not only writing about soldiers, but also writing about cadres; not only writing about battles, but also writing about campaigns. The leaders of the troops have also failed to give sufficient encouragement and appropriate criticism to the works that have been created or performed. They are not good at uniting and cultivating some writers around them, just as Lenin cared for Gorky and Chairman Mao cared for literary and artistic workers, which naturally also affects the ideological and artistic qualities of the works. In addition, the mass literary and artistic activities of "soldiers acting as soldiers" have not been improved and are still limited to a relatively narrow scope, and the forms are not diverse enough; the problem of training and improving literary and artistic cadres of the troops has not been well resolved, and the exchange of experiences in literary and artistic work between various brother troops is insufficient, which hinders the improvement of the ideological and artistic qualities of the literary and artistic works of the troops. The development of the war and the improvement of the cultural and ideological level of cadres and soldiers require works that can explain ideological problems and the creation of more representative figures.

    In general, the reason for the above shortcomings is that the implementation of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art is not profound enough. In the past, although the literary and artistic workers of the troops have achieved great success in "serving the soldiers," they have not been able to solve the problems of how to improve further, strengthen the leadership of the art troupes (teams), combine the training of writers and actors with professional literary and artistic writers, continue to go deep into the life of the troops, enable creation to solve and improve ideological problems, create more advanced works of new heroism, and how to organize leadership to produce such works. This needs to be studied and resolved in the future.

    The report proposed that the future guiding principles and methods of the People's Liberation Army's literary and artistic work are: Under the general task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending our homeland, continue to go deep into the life of the troops, improve the level of creation, more closely combine the literary and artistic activities of the broad masses of soldiers, the art troupes (teams), and the professional literary and artistic activities of writers, carry out creative movements, train professional writers and actors, and take the literary and artistic work of the People's Liberation Army to the next level. This is the guiding principle for the army's literary and artistic work and the activities of art troupes (teams) and professional writers and artists in 1951. The army's creative plan for 1951 should be formulated according to this guiding principle.

    In order to implement the above guiding principles, the report pointed out:

    1. The literary and artistic work of the troops should be closely integrated with the current struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend our homeland. Use creation, singing, dance, painting, news reports, etc., to expose the ferocity and cruelty of U.S. imperialism, be vigilant against its cunning, despise its depravity and shamelessness, in order to stimulate the high patriotic sentiments of all commanders and fighters, and achieve the purpose of defending the motherland and defending world peace. Writing about the Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War is also to strengthen this theme of struggle.

    2. Literary and artistic workers of the troops should realize that going deep into the life of the troops is not only to solve the technical problems of creation, but more importantly to solve the political problems of creation and the clear class concept of writers. They should truly live, study, and fight together with the broad masses of soldiers and cadres, like the Soviet writers. It is possible and necessary to organize and lead all literary and artistic workers to continue to go deep into all aspects of the troops, serve as deputy positions in the army's various levels of organs, or send them to senior and junior infantry schools or military academies to specialize in military business, so that they can truly have deep thought and work deeply. Only such people are literary and artistic workers who understand military affairs and can truly become creators and performers who are needed and supported by the broad masses of soldiers and cadres. On the other hand, we should also pay attention to cultivating literary and artistic backbones in the company, so that they can become professional writers and activists, serving as a bridge between the art troupes (teams) and the broad masses of soldiers.

    3. The leaders of the troops should regard the work of improving old literary and artistic workers and training new literary and artistic workers as a link in the entire new heroism movement, just like cultivating revolutionary new heroism; they must learn to master literary and artistic policies. Leading literary and artistic work is different from leading troops. In addition to strengthening and helping writers and actors improve their class consciousness, it is absolutely necessary to widely abide by Lenin's words: "Literary work cannot be subordinated to mechanical leveling and averaging; it is absolutely necessary to guarantee a wider range for personal creativity and preferences, and to guarantee full freedom for thought, image, form, and content."

    4. The leaders of the troops should regard the literary and artistic troops as their own kind of arms, and regard leading literary and artistic work as a part of leading and organizing war and political work. This is the problem of how to use the literary and artistic troops. Always pay attention to the characteristics of literary and artistic work, and the use in any position and any task must be summed up into one thing: "It is conducive to and helps the development of literary and artistic work, and the progress and improvement of literary and artistic troops." Be good at discovering their characteristics, encouraging and cultivating them; for the principled mistakes of literary and artistic workers, such as specializing in old dramas, refusing to go to the company, and reflecting the bourgeois and feudal thoughts in their works and performances, even if it is a small point, we should resolutely oppose it. The literary and artistic workers themselves must love the works and activities of the broad masses of soldiers, help and improve the works and activities of the broad masses of soldiers, personally participate in the literary and artistic activities of the broad masses of soldiers, and learn from them.

    5. Literary and artistic workers of the troops should learn from professional writers and from people outside the army in order to absorb nutrients, enrich themselves, and be bolder in creation; but they must maintain the characteristics of the People's Liberation Army as a combat team forever. Do not blindly learn, and do not lose our glorious traditions.

    6. The leaders of the troops should institutionalize the review of the army's literary and artistic work, especially the review of the literary and artistic activities of the company. This is to be responsible for the literary and artistic troops, specifically cultivate and improve literary and artistic cadres, and it is a powerful driving force for carrying out creative movements. This will guarantee the regularity, mass character, and combat character of the People's Liberation Army's literary and artistic work. We should see that there is still bureaucracy and purely commandism in the leadership of literary and artistic work. The Third Field Army has decided to conduct a general review of the army's literary and artistic work, through specific methods such as work summaries, literary and artistic awards, exhibitions of works, and performance observations, to review past achievements, award model units, and promote future work. This should be promoted.

    The conclusion of the report stated: We are such a powerful People's Liberation Army, and we are moving towards modernization. The field of creation and performance for our literary and artistic workers is broad and rich. We have nearly 70,000 comrades engaged in literary and artistic work (although it still needs a process of cultivation and improvement), and there are hundreds of millions of participants, creators, and performers in literary and artistic activities. As long as we do not lose the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers indicated by Chairman Mao, and always link with the literary and artistic activities of the broad masses of soldiers, and always act as a combat team, the literary and artistic work of our People's Liberation Army will surely continue to grow, strengthen, and triumph on the basis of existing achievements, and become an important part of Chinese people's literature and art.

　　把人民解放军的文艺工作提高一步
    解放军总政治部文化部部长陈沂报告方针、办法
    【新华社二十日讯】中国人民解放军总政治部文化部部长陈沂，在去年十二月十七日全军宣传、教育、文化工作会议上，作了关于“把人民解放军的文艺工作提高一步”的报告。该报告摘要如下：
    报告首先指出：文艺工作是人民解放军政治工作中重要的部分——思想部分的工作。人民解放军的文艺工作是继承和贯彻了红四军古田会议的决议和在毛主席指示“文艺为工农兵服务”的总方向下成长、发展和壮大起来的。在四年解放战争中，人民解放军的文艺工作者，在毛主席的伟大思想指导下，曾参加战争，前仆后继地奋斗着，有的甚至负伤或牺牲。通过他们的作品——特别突出的是戏剧、通讯报道、军事摄影、军事新闻片，反映了战争，鼓动了群众，改造了俘虏，成为战时政治工作及开展新区群众工作的有力助手和重要的组成部分。这种文艺工作，已开始深入到广大的战士中间，与他们的战斗生活、对文艺的喜爱和天才相结合，从而产生了“兵演兵”、“兵写兵”、“兵唱兵”、“兵画兵”、“兵舞兵”等群众性的文艺活动。这种活动，不论在平时或在火线和战壕里，都对鼓舞士气起着重大的作用。如淮海战役中，部队文工团的活动完全同火线上的战斗动作相结合，在追击敌人和打坦克时，文工团的团员们就唱起鼓动士气的快板；有的并帮助战士在战壕里开庆功会和帮助战士在战壕里写作。
    报告接着说：尽管人民解放军的各种文艺作品在艺术水平上还存在着若干缺点，但却都是反映或解决部队思想问题的。在四年解放战争中，第一野战军创作了两千多种“兵演兵”的作品；第四野战军出版了六百二十万字的文艺作品；第二野战军出版了四十种文艺丛书和十八期文艺刊物；此外，第三野战军及华北、东北军区也都各自出版了文艺丛书和文艺刊物。这些作品绝大部分是部队培养起来的作家所执笔的，其中包括了军的副政委、部长、科长、教导员、指导员、战斗英雄及随军记者等。他们的作品都接触了一定的思想问题。例如一野的“英雄刘四虎”，是歌颂独胆英雄刘四虎单身冲入敌阵解决战斗的英勇业迹；二野的“王克勤班”，是解决部队中的互助问题；三野的“海上风暴”，是写部队克服严重困难的伟大精神；四野的“杨勇立功”，是写落后战士的转变。东北“炮弹是怎样造成的”，是解决老干部进入城市如何接受新鲜事物的问题；华北的“战斗里成长”，是写继续保持我军的光荣传统。其他的一张画、一个歌、一个舞以及一篇小通讯等，大多都与部队广大指战员的思想、战斗生活和学习有关。这样，许多简单而平凡的事情，经过战士编演出来，就能发生鼓舞士气、解释政策、联系群众、取得胜利的作用。
    报告进而分析了获得这些成果的原因。报告说：因为人民解放军进行的是正义的战争，每一个指战员都懂得进行战争是为什么和保卫谁的利益。这种自觉性随着战争的进展和胜利而逐步提高，所以它能克服许多非无产阶级的、与毛泽东战略思想相违背的思想，而归结成一个革命的新英雄主义。部队的文艺工作者就是这种革命的新英雄主义的一员，所以他们的作品，不管其成熟程度如何，都是以反映和创造革命的新英雄主义为题材的。战争并使文艺工作者得到锻炼；部队的领导者同时给了文艺工作者以巨大的帮助和鼓励，使他们的工作逐渐进步。此外，文艺工作者自身的埋头苦干精神，也对部队文艺工作的成就有着重大的贡献。
    报告在肯定上述成绩后，指出目前部队文艺工作中还存在着若干缺点，其中最主要的缺点是，作品的思想性和艺术性都不够，作家的阶级观点还不够分明，因而在描写革命的新英雄主义上就不够突出。迄今为止尚不能完美的创造出一些为全军都闻名、都景仰的英雄人物来起带头作用。按照全军英勇斗争的历史以及在斗争中所涌现的英雄事迹和英雄人物来看，可供我们写作和表演的材料是很多的，但是我们的作家和演员们，一般还只是接触与反映了问题的表面，没有很好地深入到问题的实质。因而使我们的文艺工作还落在战争的发展和部队的进步之后。
    这些缺点的产生，是由于部队文艺工作者过去处在频繁紧张的战斗中，常常要“赶任务”，只能是“遇到什么，写什么，演唱什么”，而没有能够注意从现有水平上提高。不仅写前方，而且写后方；不仅写战士，而且写干部；不仅写战斗，而且写战役。部队的领导者，对于已创作或演出的作品也没有做到充分的鼓励和适当的批评，他们还不善于团结和培养一些作家在自己的周围，如像列宁关心高尔基、毛主席关心文艺工作者一样，这自然也影响到作品的思想性和艺术性。另外，“兵演兵”的群众性的文艺活动未能提高，还限于比较狭小的范围，形式也不够多样；培养和提高部队文艺干部的问题没有很好解决，各兄弟部队间的文艺工作经验交流不够等，都妨碍了部队文艺作品的思想性和艺术性的提高。而战争的发展，干部战士文化、思想水平的提高，更须要能说明思想问题的作品，更能具代表性的人物的创造。
    总的来说，产生上述缺点的原因，还是对毛泽东文艺思想的贯彻不够深刻。以往部队的文艺工作者，虽然在“为兵服务”上获得了很大的成绩，但对如何提高一步，加强文工团（队）的领导，培养作家、演员与专业文艺作家结合，继续深入部队生活，使创作能解决和提高思想问题，创造新英雄主义的较高级的作品，以及如何组织领导去产生这种作品都没有得到很好的解决，这是今后需要加以研究和解决的。
    报告提出今后人民解放军文艺工作的方针和作法是：在抗美援朝保家卫国的总任务下，继续深入部队生活，提高创作水平，把广大战士的文艺活动、文工团（队）和作家的专业文艺活动更密切地结合起来，开展创作运动，培养专业作家和演员，使人民解放军的文艺工作提高一步。这是今后全军文艺工作和文工团（队）、专业作家文艺活动的方针。一九五一年全军的创作计划应据此方针制订。
    为贯彻上述方针，报告指出：
    一、部队文艺工作要与当前抗美援朝保家卫国斗争密切结合。用创作、演唱、歌、舞、画、通讯报道等，暴露美帝国主义的凶恶和残暴，警惕它的狡猾，鄙视它的堕落和无耻，以激发全体指战员的高度爱国情绪，达到保卫祖国和保卫世界和平的目的。而写长征、写抗战、写解放战争也都是为的加强这一斗争主题。
    二、部队文艺工作者应认识到深入部队生活，不仅是为解决创作的技术的问题，更重要的是解决创作的政治问题、作家阶级观念分明的问题。应该使自己真正同广大战士和干部一起生活、学习和战斗，像苏联的作家们一样。可以而且应该组织领导全体文艺工作者继续深入到部队各方面去，在军队各级机关担任副职，或送到高、初级步兵学校或军事学院去专门学习军事业务，这样才能真正思想深入，工作深入。这样的人，才是懂得军事的文艺工作者，才能真正成为广大战士和干部所需要的和拥护的创作者和演出者。另一方面，也应注意培养连队的文艺骨干，使其成为专业作家和活动家，作为文工团（队）和广大战士中联系的桥梁。
    三、部队领导者要把提高老的文艺工作者和培养新的文艺工作者的工作，当成培养革命的新英雄主义一样，成为整个新英雄主义运动的一环；要学习掌握文艺政策。领导文艺工作和带兵不一样，除了加强和帮助作家演员们提高阶级觉悟外，广泛遵守列宁的话：“文学事业不能服从于机械的水平化、平均化，要为个人的创造性和好尚保证较宽大的范围、给思想、形象、形式、内容保证充分自由是绝对必要的。”
    四、部队领导者应把文艺军队当成自己的一种兵种，把领导文艺工作当成领导与组织战争和政治工作的一部分，这就是如何使用文艺军队的问题。随时注意文艺工作的特点，使用在任何岗位和任何任务都要归结成一个东西：“有利于、有助于文艺工作的发展，文艺军队的进步与提高”。要善于发现他们的特点，予以鼓励和培养；对于文艺工作者的原则性错误，比方专演旧戏、不肯下连队以及作品和演出中反映资产阶级的，封建的思想，那怕是一小点，也应该坚决反对。在文艺工作者本身，就要热爱广大士兵的作品和活动，帮助和提高广大士兵的作品和活动，亲身参加广大士兵的文艺活动，并向他们学习。
    五、部队文艺工作者应向专业作家学习，向军队以外的人学习。以吸收养料，丰富自己，更大胆地进行创造；但必须保持人民解放军永远是战斗队的特点。一不盲目学习，二不丢掉光荣传统。
    六、部队领导者把检阅全军的文艺工作，特别是检阅连队文艺活动订成制度这是对文艺军队负责，具体培养和提高文艺干部的问题，更是开展创作运动的有力推动，这将保证人民解放军文艺工作的经常性、群众性和战斗性。应该看到文艺工作领导上还有官僚主义和单纯使用的命令主义。三野已决定来一个全军文艺工作大检阅，通过工作总结、文艺评奖、展览作品、观摩演出等具体方法，检阅过去的成绩，评奖模范单位推动今后的工作。这是应该提倡的。
    报告的结语称：我们是如此强大的一支人民解放军，而且正在走向近代化。我们的文艺工作者创作和演出的领域是宽广的、丰富的。我们有将近七万从事文艺工作的同志（尽管还需要一个培养提高的过程），有成千百万文艺活动的参加者、创作者、扮演者，只要我们不迷失毛主席所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，永远跟广大士兵的文艺活动相联结，永远当个战斗队，我们人民解放军的文艺工作一定会在现有的成果上继续成长、壮大、胜利，成为中国人民文艺的重要组成部分。
