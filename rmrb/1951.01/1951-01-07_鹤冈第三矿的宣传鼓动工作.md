　　Propaganda and Mobilization Work at the No. 3 Mine of Hegang
　　Hegang Mining Area Committee Hu Shaozhong
　　The Hegang Mining Area launched patriotic and current affairs education from the end of October last year, guaranteeing the completion and surpassing of production tasks.

　　Before October of last year, the No. 3 Mine could not very well complete its production tasks. Starting from the end of October, with intermittent propaganda and mobilization work, the sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs among all employees was strengthened, and a wave of patriotic production enthusiasm was sparked. As a result, not only was the production task completed, but it was also exceeded daily. From the 16th to the 20th, in five days, the task was exceeded by 24.8 percent. It has become the mine in the whole bureau that has exceeded its production task the most, and the output is also good. In addition, employees voluntarily contributed various materials.

　　Now, I will write down a few experiences in carrying out propaganda and mobilization work in the No. 3 Mine in the past 20-odd days.

　　　　　　　　One, From the Masses, to the Masses

　　What is the problem that comrades who do propaganda and mobilization work in factories and mines often feel distressed about? That is, they feel that their minds lack fresh things to promote to the masses. Although they are very enthusiastic about publicizing this and that to the masses, the masses say: "I have heard these propaganda many times before and don't want to listen anymore!" This shows that if there is new propaganda content to promote to the masses, the masses are willing to listen; even if the speech time is slightly longer, it is acceptable, but if it is the same old routine, the masses will be impatient. As a result, it is impossible to convene meetings; even if they come, they will doze off and not listen. Propaganda and mobilization workers will also be distressed; and complain to the masses: "We kindly convene a meeting to give these people some education, who knew it would make them unhappy. There is no way, the masses here are too backward and do not understand people... ."

　　This raises a very important question: Are the masses backward? Or is it because the masses are unwilling to listen to the same old propaganda? To say that the masses are "backward," what attitude should a party propaganda and mobilization worker take towards these so-called ideologically backward masses? As a propaganda and mobilization worker, one should carefully understand and study why the masses are unwilling to listen? What are they willing to listen to? What should be given to the masses? How to give it? A person who is good at publicizing to the masses must constantly understand the ideological situation of the masses, and conduct in-depth analysis of these ideological situations, theorize and systematize these things, and then take them to the masses to promote. In this way, the propaganda will no longer be the same old routine, and the masses will be happy to listen to your propaganda speeches. This is very important, but on the contrary, some propaganda and mobilization workers do not pay attention to such an important issue.

　　One type thinks that the propaganda task is completed once propaganda and mobilization work has been carried out. They do not care about the propaganda effect or the reactions of the masses. Therefore, these people cannot obtain things from the masses to enrich and modify their propaganda content, and they have to use old materials to promote to the masses, and the result is of course to be opposed by the masses.

　　Another type of propaganda and mobilization worker is busy with administrative work all day long, and does not seriously read and study current affairs and policies; at the same time, they do not go to the masses to obtain new things; they talk about whatever is arranged by the superiors. Once they are done talking, they stop. In this way, they fall into a passive position.

　　This is the reason why propaganda and mobilization workers in the past were full of enthusiasm but met with resistance from the masses. How can this be blamed on the backwardness of the masses? Being active is good; but these things must be combined with the correct propaganda and mobilization work guidelines and methods.

　　How to absorb new things from the masses?

　　Here is a typical example:

　　After the initial launch of the patriotic labor competition in the No. 3 Mine, the output in the pit quickly increased, exceeding the original plan by 24.8 percent. However, the transport workers could not keep up, and as a result, coal could not be transported out of the pit, causing dissatisfaction among the workers in the pit with the transport workers, who often shouted or made a fuss.

　　Why did such a problem occur with the transport workers? Therefore, the propaganda and mobilization workers conducted in-depth research at the Party Standing Committee meeting; and came up with a solution.

　　The situation is like this: All three inclined shafts in the mine have team leaders leading the first and second shifts, so although these two shifts cannot transport all the coal mined by the workers in the pit, they are close; the third shift, because there is no team leader, the mine cars cannot keep up and cannot transport the coal. This shows that the transport workers' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs and patriotic ideological consciousness are not high, and there are views of hired labor. For example, they are still not very clear about the relationship between the country and themselves, the relationship between the front line and the rear in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend the country, and the relationship between current interests and long-term interests.

　　At the same time, the vast majority of transport workers are elderly workers. The thinking of these elderly workers is: "We are so old, and we have personally seen and heard in the past old society: the elderly are unable to work and have no savings, the government does not care, and they either freeze to death or starve to death, what will happen to us in the future? The current country is good, but can it provide for the elderly? Maybe we will have such a day." Therefore, these elderly workers often think: "What to do? What to do?" This shows that these elderly workers still look at the current people's government with the past view of the reactionary ruling class government. This hinders production enthusiasm. This shows that it is necessary to combine the ideological education of being masters of one's own affairs and patriotism with solving the ideological concerns of elderly workers. Based on the above ideological situation, the following propaganda content and methods were decided:

　　(1) Use the Nanshan Nursing Home as the main material for propaganda. Talk about the living conditions of the Nanshan Nursing Home. Explain that these old people were homeless and suffering people in the past, but because the country is now their own, they can live in the Nanshan Nursing Home. The state provides for them until the end of their lives.

　　(2) The current address and buildings of the Nanshan Nursing Home are the former Jiaozheng Hospital during the period of Japanese imperialism, which was a place where Japanese bandits killed people. The U.S. imperialists are just as merciless as the Japanese imperialists. The U.S. imperialists have already killed many Korean people and still want to come and kill Chinese people. Therefore, in order to protect our country and protect our nursing homes; and run the nursing homes even better than they are now, everyone must overcome difficulties, refuel and produce coal, increase the strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and defeat the U.S. imperialist aggression.

　　Therefore, a transport meeting was held and propaganda and mobilization education work was carried out. On the spot, the enthusiasm of some old men was mobilized, and they expressed that they would work hard in production. The next day, the mine transported more than a hundred tons of coal. Since then, the phenomenon of transport workers not keeping up with the coal mining in the pit has gradually decreased.

　　　　　　　　Two, Close Combination of Propaganda Work and Organizational Work

　　Propaganda and mobilization work must be timely coordinated with meticulous organizational work. In this way, propaganda and mobilization work can exert its greater effectiveness.

　　When the higher-level Party instructed to publicize current events and launch the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the propaganda and mobilization workers of the No. 3 Mine explained patriotism and internationalism to party members and all employees and their families in relatively simple language, specifically pointing out that everyone needs to love their country with practical actions. Family members of employees must ensure that their husbands do not have absenteeism and hand in public property. Also, in order to prevent air raids, the wooden houses in front of the door (for storing sundries) should be dismantled, etc. Because everyone really understood that without a country, there would be no home, some people expressed great emotion on the spot. In this way, organizational mobilization work was carried out at the meeting. As a result, some people signed up to hand in public property on the spot. After the meeting, a joint meeting of team leaders and committee members was held to organize the handing in of public property and the dismantling of wooden houses. In seven days, more than 300 foreign pots, more than 200 iron shovels, more than 200 drills (for digging coal and punching holes), and other public properties were handed in.

　　Regarding the dismantling of wooden houses, a few activists began to dismantle them after the meeting. Although most family members understood that this was beneficial to the country and themselves; they just had no place to put their odds and ends, so they hesitated. There were also individual backward elements who openly opposed it. At this time, the Party vigorously organized the activists to take the lead, first leading the middle elements, and then leading the backward elements. So the result was very good, and the original requirements were met.

### 鹤冈第三矿的宣传鼓动工作

　　鹤冈第三矿的宣传鼓动工作
    鹤冈矿区委员会  胡绍中
    鹤冈矿区于去年十月底起展开了爱国主义时事教育保证了完成并超过了生产任务。
    第三矿在去年十月份以前，总不能很好地完成生产任务。从十月底起断断续续的进行了一些宣传鼓动工作，就加强了全体职工的主人翁的责任心，掀起了爱国主义的生产热潮。这样就不仅完成了生产任务，并且每天超过了任务。从十六日到二十日五天中就超过任务百分之二十四·八。已成为全局各矿在生产上超过任务最多的一个矿；而且产量也好。此外，职工又自动献纳了各种器材。
    现将第三矿上二十余天中进行宣传鼓动工作的几点体会，写在后面。
            一、从群众中来，到群众中去
    在厂矿里作宣传鼓动工作的同志，经常感到苦恼的是个什么问题呢？那就是感到自己脑子缺乏新鲜东西向群众宣传。虽然很热心地对群众宣传这个宣传那个，但群众却说：“你这些宣传我早已听过多次了，不想再听了！”这就说明了如果有新的宣传内容向群众进行宣传时，群众是愿意听的；甚至讲话时间略长一点也可以，但是如果是老一套，群众就不耐烦听了。这样就发生了开会召集不起来；即使来了也是打瞌睡听不进去。宣传鼓动工作者也就苦恼起来；并且埋怨群众：“我们好心好意的召开个会议给这些人一些教育，谁知惹得他们不乐意起来。没办法，这里的群众太落后了，不体谅人……。”
    这就提出了一个很重要的问题：到底是群众落后呢？还是因为宣传上的老一套群众不乐意听呢？就说群众“落后”，作为一个党的宣传鼓动工作者，对这些所谓思想落后的群众应该采取什么态度呢？作为一个宣传鼓动工作者就应该用心地了解和研究群众为什么不愿意听？愿意听什么？应该给群众些什么？怎样给？一个善于向群众宣传的人，必须是不断的了解群众的思想情况，并对这些思想情况，进行深刻的分析，把这些东西理论化系统化，然后再拿到群众中去宣传。这样，宣传上就不再老一套，群众也就欢喜听你的宣传演讲。这是非常重要的，但是恰恰相反，就有一部分宣传鼓动工作者不注意这样重要的问题。
    有一种是以进行了宣传鼓动工作就算完成了宣传任务。对于宣传效果如何？群众有什么反映？这些他们都不管。因此这些人就不能从群众中取得东西充实和修改自己的宣传内容，也就不得不拿旧材料向群众进行宣传，结果当然要遭到群众的反对。
    另一种宣传鼓动工作者，整日忙于事务工作，对目前时事和政策的没有认真的阅读与研究；同时又不到群众中去取得新的东西；上面布置一点就讲一点。讲完了就停下来了。这样就陷入了被动。
    这就是过去宣传鼓动工作者的满腔热血而碰上群众钉子的原因。这怎么能埋怨群众的落后呢？积极是好的；但必须把这些东西和正确的宣传鼓动工作方针方法结合起来。
    怎样在群众中吸收新东西？
    这里有个典型的例子：
    当第三矿的爱国主义劳动竞赛初步展开之后，坑内的产量迅速增加超过了原计划百分之二四·八。但是运转工配合不上，结果坑内有煤运不出来，闹得坑内工友对运转工不满，经常喊叫；或打起“叽叽”来。
    为什么运转工发生了这样的问题呢？于是宣传鼓动工作者就在党的常委接头会上作了深入的研究；并想出了解决的方法。
    情况是这样的：全矿三个斜井第一二班都有班长领导，所以这两个班虽不能把坑内工挖下的煤全部运出，但是差不多少；第三班，因无班长领导，车皮就跟不上，运不出煤来。这说明了运转工友的主人翁责任心和爱国主义思想觉悟不高，存在着雇佣劳动观点。例如对国家与自己的关系，对抗美援朝保家卫国的前线与后方的关系，对目前利益与长远利益的关系还是不太清楚。
    同时运转工中绝大部分是老年工友。这些老年工友的思想是：“我们年纪这样大了，在过去旧社会上曾亲自看见和听说过：老年人因无力作活，又没积蓄，官方不管，不是冻死就得饿死，我们将来又怎么办呢？现在的国家好是好，能养老吗？说不定我们也有这样一天。”于是这些老年工人经常想：“怎么办？怎么办？”这说明这些老年工人还是以过去看反动统治阶级的政府来看现在的人民政府。这就阻碍了生产积极性。这样说明了必须把主人翁思想、爱国主义的思想教育，和解决老年工友的思想顾虑结合起来进行。根据以上思想情况，就决定了以下的宣传内容和方法：
    （一）以南山的养老院为宣传的主要材料。讲南山养老院的生活情况。说明这些老人过去是无家可归的受苦人，因为现在国家是自己的了，所以能够住到南山养老院去。由国家养老送终。
    （二）现在南山养老院地址房舍，就是原来的日本帝国主义统治时期的绞正院，是日寇杀人的地方。美帝和日本帝国主义一样是杀人不眨眼的家伙。美帝已经杀害了好多朝鲜人民，还想来杀害中国人民。因此为了保住我们的国家，保住我们的养老院；并把养老院办得比现在更好，就得大家伙克服困难，加油出煤，增加抗美援朝保家卫国的力量，击溃美帝的侵略。
    于是召开运转会议，进行了宣传鼓动教育工作。当场把一些老头子的劲头鼓动上来了，表示要好好生产。第二天全矿就多运出煤百余吨。以后运转工跟不上坑内挖煤的现象也就逐渐减少。
            二、宣传工作与组织工作密切结合
    宣传鼓动工作，一定要及时的配合以细致的组织工作。这样宣传鼓动工作才能发挥其更大的效用。
    当上级党指示宣传时事，开展抗美援朝运动时候，第三矿宣传鼓动工作者就以较通俗的话语给党员和全体职工及其家属讲解爱国主义和国际主义，具体指出每个人是需要以实际行动来爱自己的国家。职工家属就要保证丈夫不欠勤，交出公物。以及为了防空，应把门前的木板房（储放杂物的）拆掉等。因为大家确实了解了没有国就没有家，当场就有人表示非常感动。这样就在会场上进行组织动员工作。结果，当场就有人报名交公物。会后，又召开了组长委员一级的联席会议，组织交公物，拆木板房。七天里就交来洋锅三百余个，铁锹二百余把，钎子（挖煤打眼用）二百余支，还有其他公物等。
    关于拆木板房，开会后就有少数积极分子开始拆了。大多数家属虽然明白这对国家对自己都是有利的；但就是没地方放零碎东西，所以犹豫不决。还有个别的落后分子公开反对。这时党就大力的组织积极分子带头，先带起中间分子，以后又带起落后分子。所以结果很好，达到了原来的要求。
