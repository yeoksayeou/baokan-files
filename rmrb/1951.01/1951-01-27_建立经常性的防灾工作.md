Establishing Regular Disaster Prevention Work

Preventing disasters and famine is an important issue related to the lives of the broad masses of people in our country. Therefore, it should become one of the regular tasks of governments at all levels. Now that winter will soon be over, local people's governments should pay close attention to the spring famine that may occur in some areas, and should devise ways to prevent it as early as possible. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has issued instructions to inspect disaster relief work, which is very necessary.

As everyone knows, under the long-term reactionary rule of old China, there were years of disasters and famines, and the people had no savings. After the birth of New China, the People's Government has worked hard to rescue disaster victims, restore and develop production, and has achieved significant results; however, the time is still very short, and it is not possible to eradicate the disasters and famines left over from history all at once. In fact, this is still a long-term goal. Therefore, we cannot but regard disaster prevention as a regular task. Our people's government and the broad masses of people overcame a fairly serious disaster last year with amazing perseverance; and ensured that the whole country, except for individual areas, achieved a great harvest last year. This makes it easy for some cadres and the masses to ignore disaster prevention, and it is also easy for waste to occur among some of the masses; therefore, local people's governments must pay attention and earnestly prevent possible disasters.

The main way to prevent disasters and famine at present is to promote thrift. In areas with good harvests last year, it is perfectly appropriate for the masses to appropriately improve their lives according to their own economic conditions. However, under no circumstances should we oppose waste. According to materials from Hebei, East China, and Central South, due to last year's bumper harvest, waste has indeed occurred among some of the masses. This should be persuaded and corrected. We should advise the masses not to be satisfied with "having rice for one meal and firewood for one bake," but should strive to achieve "a small stream flowing steadily" and "storing grain to prepare for famine," as the saying goes.

Local people's governments must be vigilant and overcome complacency; they should have a full and clear understanding of the living conditions of the masses in their jurisdictions. In any area, if signs of disaster are found, necessary measures should be taken immediately to quickly overcome them and prevent the disaster from expanding. This is necessary not only for areas that suffered disasters last year but also for areas that had good harvests last year.

We have overthrown the manufacturers of disasters and famines—the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang. Our government and people have rich experience in preventing disasters and famines. As long as the people's governments at all levels and the broad masses of people continue to be vigilant, we will be able to prevent the occurrence of disasters. Even if disasters do occur, we will be able to eliminate them quickly.

　　建立经常性的防灾工作
    防灾防荒，是关系我国广大人民生活的重要问题，因此，它应该成为各级人民政府的经常工作之一。现在，冬季转眼就要过去，各地人民政府亟应注意某些地区可能发生的春荒，应该及早设法加以防止。中央人民政府内务部业已发出检查救灾工作的指示，这是十分必要的。
    尽人皆知，旧的中国在长期反动统治之下，连年灾荒，民无储存。新中国在诞生之后，人民政府即努力于抢救灾荒，恢复与发展生产，并已获得重大成就；但是，时间毕竟还很短，还不能把历史上遗留下来的灾荒，一旦根绝。事实上，这还是一个长期奋斗的目标。因此，我们就不能不把防备灾荒当作一项经常的工作。我们的人民政府和广大人民，去年曾以惊人的毅力，战胜了相当严重的灾荒；并保证了去年除个别地区外全国获得一个很大的丰收。这就容易使一部分干部和群众忽视防灾，也容易在一部分群众中发生浪费的现象；因此，各地人民政府必须提起注意，认真防止可能发生的灾荒。
    目前防灾防荒的主要办法是提倡节约。在去年丰收的地区，群众按照自己的经济条件，适当改善自己的生活，是完全应该的。但是，不论在任何情况下，我们都应该反对浪费。根据河北、华东、中南的材料，因为去年的丰收，在一部分群众中确已发生了浪费现象。这是应该加以劝导与纠正的。我们应该劝告群众，不要以为“有米一顿，有柴一烘”就满足了，应该如俗语所说的，努力做到“细水长流”，“积谷备荒”。
    各地人民政府务要提高警惕，克服麻痹思想；应该对所辖地区的群众生活状况，有充分而清楚的了解。在任何地区，如果发现灾象，应立即采取必要措施，迅速予以克服，勿使灾情扩大。这不但对于去年受灾的地区而且对于去年丰收的地区也是必要的。
    我们已经打倒了灾荒的制造者——国民党的反动政权，我们的政府和人民都有丰富的防灾防荒经验，只要各级人民政府和广大人民继续提高警惕，我们就有可能防止灾荒的发生。即便遇有灾荒发生，也能够迅速予以消除。
