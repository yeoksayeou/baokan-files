　　Reactionary Associated Press Utters Lament
    American Imperialism Faces Numerous Difficulties
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 14th] The Associated Press, the news agency of American imperialism, issued a report from Washington on January 8th, pessimistically admitting that the Truman administration is facing "extremely urgent problems that cannot be guaranteed to be resolved quickly."

    The dispatch listed many such "problems." First, in the Eastern question, "how to maintain allies within the United Nations." The dispatch said helplessly: Although the United States "is determined to demand" that the United Nations pass a resolution slandering the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" and implementing so-called "punishment" measures against China, Britain, France, and other Western European countries "are shrinking back."

    Another "problem" in Western Europe's war preparations is "how to unite Western Europe, determine and be willing to start sacrificing, and build defenses (referring to aggressive deployments) at an urgent speed."

    "Problems" also exist within the American ruling clique, namely "how to persuade skeptical members of Congress to believe that the Western European defense plan (should be read as aggression plan) has sufficient hope of success and there is reason to invest more American troops and billions of dollars into it."

    There is also a "problem" that may further develop all the above "problems," that is, "whether to ask the United Nations forces to withdraw from Korea, and if so, when." The Associated Press pointed out in horror: If the invading troops withdraw from Korea, then it will "involve huge political difficulties, namely preventing this failure from causing the most serious blow to the anti-communist morale of the world."

    In the face of all these unsolvable "problems," the Associated Press had to lament: The Truman administration is facing an "urgent diplomatic crisis."

　　反动的美联社发出哀鸣
    美帝面临重重困难
    【新华社十四日讯】美帝国主义的通讯社美联社一月八日自华盛顿发出一篇报道，悲观地承认杜鲁门政府，正面临着“极为紧急而不能保证迅速解决的难题”。
    该电列举出许多这样的“难题”。首先就是在东方问题上“如何保持联合国中的同盟”。该电无可奈何地说：虽然美国“有决心要求”联合国通过诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”并对中国实行所谓“惩罚”措施的议案，但是，英法及其他西欧国家“却畏缩不前”。
    另一个“难题”在西欧备战问题上，就是“如何使西欧团结一致，决心并且愿意开始牺牲，以紧急的速度建立防务（指侵略部署）”。
    “难题”也存在于美国统治集团内部，即“如何说服国会中抱怀疑态度的议员，使他们相信，西欧防御计划（应读为侵略计划）有足够的成功希望，有理由把更多的美国军队和亿万美元投下去”。
    还有一个可能使上述所有“难题”进一步发展的“难题”，那就是“是否要求联合国军队退出朝鲜，如果退出，应在何时”。美联社惶恐地指出：如果侵略军队一旦撤离朝鲜，那么，又将“涉及政治上的巨大困难，即防止这一失败对全世界的反共士气发生最严重的打击”。
    在所有这些无法解决的“难题”之前，美联社不得不哀鸣：杜鲁门政府正面对着“紧急的外交危机”。
