　　Recalling the Cruel Struggle Under Stalemate
    ——Sights and Sounds of Northern Vietnam, Part Two
    By Our Special Correspondent  Meng Qing
    When I was staying in a certain place in northern Vietnam, several young military officers from the Vietnamese army headquarters came to see me. They were my Vietnamese friends from Hanoi more than ten years ago. At that time, we were all young students and often played together on Sundays. We rarely talked about politics then, only occasionally revealing a little hatred for the French colonial rulers in our words. Now, they have all become heroic defenders of their country. The people in front of me were wearing captured French military uniforms, chests puffed out, and full of spirit. Talking about their student days in Hanoi, they said, "At that time, damn it, the French colonial rulers simply wouldn't let us breathe." They enthusiastically inquired about everything in New China, showed strong interest in Beijing, and expressed infinite admiration for Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They also introduced me to the current situation of Vietnam's war of resistance and the heroic anti-Japanese struggle of the past few years.
    Vietnam is divided into three parts: North, Central, and South. The South has a population of about eight million, centered on Saigon and Dike. Waterways are accessible in all directions, and railways and highways are intertwined like a spider web. On this plain, fields are connected, stretching as far as the eye can see, and the production of rice and rubber is world-famous. After Japan's surrender in 1945, French colonialists, under the cover of British arms, climbed back onto the Vietnamese coast here, gradually expanding and encroaching northward. Currently, the French-Vietnamese army's supreme headquarters is located in Saigon, and the South is their last base. In the near future, when the colonialists are driven out of the North and Central, they will still attempt to rely on this place, using the sea as a base, to carry out a dying struggle. My friends said with confidence, "We are going to annihilate them. It is fortunate for these people who come from the sea if they can return to the sea. We will wipe them out on the mainland." At present, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam not only has independent liberated areas in the South, but the vast countryside is also the domain of guerrillas, who often appear and disappear in the suburbs of large cities occupied by the French army. The people in Saigon, under the rule of the French imperialists, still regularly pay taxes and donations to the revolutionary government and army.
    Also with them was Mr. Li, a capable farmer from Central Vietnam with a dark complexion, a loud voice, full of enthusiasm and fighting will, who had just traveled a long way north to attend a meeting. He told me many stories of the people of Central Vietnam fighting against the enemy.
    Central Vietnam is a narrow, long mountainous area, with a mountain range extending from north to south, and stretching east and west, sometimes reaching the sea. It has a population of more than four million, centered on Hue City in Thua Thien Province. Near Hue City, a mountain range divides Central Vietnam into two sides, with a larger liberated area on each side. The southern liberated area, between Quang Nam Province and Khanh Hoa Province, has a railway controlled by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, extending for three hundred miles. Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien provinces are famous as the Binh-Tri-Thien guerrilla base area, just like the North China Plain in China during the Anti-Japanese War. The French army has repeatedly launched cruel mopping-up operations here, implementing the "burn all, kill all, loot all" policy. Under the leadership of the democratic government, the masses have persisted in a tenacious and unyielding struggle. They have created various ingenious tunnels, attacking the French army everywhere like ghosts, making them exhausted. The French had no choice but to build layers of fences around their own barracks and hide inside. But when they went out of the fences to fetch water from the stream, they were often shot dead by guerrillas.
    The North is divided into the Viet Bac Inter-Zone and the Third Inter-Zone, with a population of about seven million. The Third Inter-Zone includes the Red River Delta area, which is a populous and wealthy area in the North. The Red River Delta is crisscrossed by rice paddies, and rice production is second only to the southern plains.
    The Viet Bac Inter-Zone is surrounded by mountains and forests on the east, west, and north. In the Cao Bang, Mong Cai areas and along the coastal islands, mineral resources are abundant, often exposed on the surface. This is the main anti-Japanese base area of the Vietnamese people. Before the Cao Bang-Lang Son Campaign in 1950, the French aggressors controlled most of the cities in the Third Inter-Zone, but the Vietnamese People's Army and people's armed forces widely launched and persisted in guerrilla warfare in the countryside. In the Viet Bac Inter-Zone, the French army only occupied some discontinuous lines and points on Route 4 from Cao Bang to Lang Son on the northeast border. On the northwest border, cities such as Lao Cai, Son La, and Lai Chau were completely isolated and surrounded.
    Now, let us review the history of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance.
    In November 1946, the French government tore up the "March 6th Agreement" and the French-Vietnamese Provisional Agreement, launching surprise attacks in Lang Son and Hai Phong. On December 19, they launched a full-scale attack on Vietnam, starting with the siege of Hanoi. The Viet Minh called on the whole nation to rise up in resistance, putting forward the slogans of "preserving the main force, limiting the enemy's development" and "intercepting the enemy's army, defending the rear." They fought in Hanoi for three months, and in Nam Dinh for two months, cutting off Route 5 between Hanoi and Hai Phong, preventing the enemy from transporting supplies for more than sixty days. This bought time to retreat calmly to the mountainous and forested areas of the Viet Bac Inter-Zone, reorganize the armed forces, and establish guerrilla base areas. In March 1947, the French colonialists mobilized their forces, concentrating 50,000 troops in the North, consolidating their occupation of large cities, and actively expanding outward, capturing some small and medium-sized cities and transportation routes, attempting to "fight a quick battle and achieve a quick victory" to eliminate the main force of the Vietnamese people's armed forces. In response to the enemy's plot, the Vietnamese people's armed forces, with the action slogans of "large teams (companies) independent, small groups (battalions) concentrated" and "turning the enemy's rear into our front line," used a certain amount of force to disperse into the countryside to carry out armed propaganda, establish a foundation for mass work, and develop guerrilla warfare. The main force, on the other hand, remained concentrated to block the enemy's offensive. This was the first stage of the Vietnamese war of resistance—the stage of the enemy advancing and we retreating.
    In October 1947, the French colonialists launched a large-scale offensive against Viet Bac, using 10,000 troops, resulting in the annihilation of more than 3,000 by the Vietnamese People's Army, and they fled back to Hanoi in a panic. From then on, the second stage of the Vietnamese war of resistance—the stalemate stage—began.
    Friends from the Vietnamese army headquarters said that the main conspiracies of the French colonialists during the stalemate stage were "political disintegration and economic blockade." First, they stirred up ethnic hatred, attempting to divide and rule. They established many puppet autonomous countries: the "Southern Cochinchina Autonomous State" in the South, the "Man Autonomous State" in the Central, and the "Thai Autonomous State" in Son La and Lai Chau in the North. They also used religion, spreading rumors that the Viet Minh burned churches and killed priests, and instructed reactionary elements among the religious believers to organize counter-revolutionary armed forces. On the other hand, they created puppet regimes, first in the North and South respectively, led by Vietnamese traitors Nguyen Van Thinh and Li Wenyu in the South, and Nguyen Huu Tri in the North. Finally, they brought out Emperor Bao Dai, who was despised by the entire Vietnamese people, to establish a "unified" puppet regime. At the same time, they also organized puppet troops, intensified special agent activities, and carried out terrorist massacres. In the economic field, they attempted to expand and consolidate their control over the mining areas (Northeast) and rice and rubber producing areas (Central and South), intensifying plunder to supply the war of aggression. On the other hand, they launched mopping-up operations against the liberated areas, putting forward a most insidious and vicious slogan: "Strike at the Viet Minh's stomach."
    In early 1950, the French army launched a large-scale mopping-up operation in Thai Binh Province in the Third Inter-Zone in the North. My friend introduced me to Sister Mei, a Vietnamese female Communist Party member who had personally experienced it at the time. She is a typical Vietnamese intellectual woman, in her twenties this year, and her husband is a cadre of the People's Army. On the third day of their honeymoon, he left her due to military tasks. When the French army mopped up Thai Binh, she led the local women to assist the troops in resisting. After the fall of Thai Binh, the French wanted to hunt down this female Communist Party member. After nine deaths and one life, she finally escaped the clutches of the beastly enemy. She was ordered to evacuate the enemy-occupied area, crawled along the edge of the rice fields close to the French army's blockade line, and squatted there back and forth day after day. Only after half a month did she get a chance to cross the enemy's sentry post and escape.
    Sister Mei began by introducing the general situation there, and then narrated this cruel mopping-up operation to me.
    Thai Binh Province is located southeast of Hanoi, on the east bank of the Red River, and is known as the granary of the Third Inter-Zone. The people evacuated from large cities such as Hai Phong, Hanoi, Nam Dinh, and Hai Duong concentrated in this area, numbering two to three million. The French army divided into three routes, attacking and besieging Thai Binh from Hung Yen, Nam Dinh, and Kien An. The army also brought a group of hooligans and deceived religious believers. Wherever they went, they let them loot and rape wantonly, attempting to create hatred and slaughter among the Vietnamese people. The colonial rulers broke into a village and robbed and burned all the people's property. There was too much grain, so they could only take part of it, and the rest was dumped into ponds or set on fire. Ploughs were led away in groups; livestock were driven into the fields to trample on the crops; young people and family members of cadres were tied up and collectively shot by the thousands; women were publicly raped on the streets in broad daylight. Speaking of this, Sister Mei became very emotional. She said, "The sisters in the towns and villages in this area, including pregnant women, old women, and girls in their teens, have suffered inhuman destruction. Many sisters were killed because of their stubborn resistance!"
    When the news of the mopping-up operation in Thai Binh reached the Viet Bac Inter-Zone, the Vietnamese soldiers who were being reorganized and preparing for the general counter-offensive were driven mad by anger. They could no longer endure it, and petitioned their superiors one after another, demanding to be sent to the front immediately to avenge the compatriots in the Third Inter-Zone.
    The victory of the Chinese people made the French imperialists very panicked. They concentrated 46 percent of all the French troops in northern Vietnam in the North, actively carrying out aggression against the Vietnamese people. The US imperialists also intensified their so-called "aid" to Vietnam, sending military advisory groups and supplying Bao Dai with a large amount of armaments and ammunition through the French army or directly. However, no matter how the imperialists colluded and how meticulously they planned their so-called "defense," in the autumn of 1950, the heroic Vietnamese People's Army finally annihilated nine battalions of the French army on the northeast border, including the three most elite mobile battalions (Blacks), the two most elite European mercenary battalions belonging to the defense forces, and a paratrooper battalion composed of Hitler's guard prisoners, which was regarded as a treasure by the French colonialists and specially used for emergency rescue. The French colonial rulers were caught off guard, and even Lao Cai, hundreds of miles away on the northwest battlefield, separated by mountains and ridges, hurriedly withdrew. In this way, the entire defense system of the French army on the Sino-Vietnamese border was defeated. Now, the heart of the French army in the North—the Red River Delta grain-producing area—has been exposed to the Vietnamese army. Look, 1951 will be a year of complete reversal of the situation in the Vietnamese war of resistance.
                                          December 27, 1950

　　回忆相持态势下的残酷斗争
    ——越北见闻之二
    本报特约记者  孟青
    当我在越北某地停留的时候，越军总部有几位青年军官来看我。他们是十多年前我在河内的越南朋友，那时大家都是年轻的学生，礼拜天常常在一起玩。那时，我们很少谈政治，只是偶尔在言词间流露出一点憎恨法国殖民地统治者的情绪。现在，他们都已成为英勇的卫国战士了。在我面前的几个人，身上穿着缴获的法国军装，挺着胸膛，非常有精神。谈起学生时代在河内的生活，他们说：“那个时候，他妈的，法国殖民地统治者简直不让我们呼吸。”他们热情地询问新中国的一切情形，对北京发生强烈的兴趣，对毛主席和中国人民解放军表露出无限敬仰。他们也给我介绍了目前越南的抗战形势和几年来英勇的抗战斗争。
    越南分为北、中、南三部。南部人口约八百万，以西贡、堤岸为中心。水路四通八达，铁路公路交织如蜘蛛网。这块平原上，田亩相连，一望无际，大米和橡胶的出产是世界闻名的。一九四五年日本投降后，法殖民地主义者借着英国武装的掩护，就在这里重新爬上越南海岸，逐渐向北扩展蚕食。现在，法越军最高统帅部设于西贡，南部是他们的最后根据地。不久的将来，当殖民地主义者被驱逐出北部和中部时，他们将仍企图凭借着这里，以海为依托，进行垂死的挣扎。我的朋友充满着信心地说：“我们是要歼灭他们的，这些人从海上来，能够再回到海里去是幸运的，我们要把他们消灭在大陆上。”目前越南民主共和国在南部不仅有独立的解放区，而且广大农村都是游击队的天下，他们经常出没于法军占领的大城市近郊。西贡市区内的民众，在法帝的统治下，仍经常给革命政府和军队纳税捐输。
    一起来看我的还有一位刚从中部长途跋涉北上开会的黎君，这是一个精明强干的中部农民，脸色黝黑，声音宏亮，充满着热情和战斗意志。他给我讲了许多中部人民抗敌斗争的故事。
    中部是狭长的大山区，一条山脉由北迤南，并向东西伸展，有些地方直达海边。人口四百多万，以顺化省的惠市为中心。惠市的附近有一条山脉，将中部分为两面，南面和北面各有一处较大的解放区，南面解放区在广南省至庆和省之间，有一条由越南民主共和国控制的铁路，长达三百里。广平、广治、承天三省是有名的平治天游击根据地，像抗日时期中国的冀中平原一样。法军曾在这里反复发动残酷的扫荡，实行抢光、杀光、烧光的三光政策。群众在民主政府的领导下，坚持着顽强不屈的斗争。他们创造了各种巧妙的地道，到处神出鬼没地袭击法军，使他们疲于奔命。法国人只好在自己的营房四周筑起层层围篱，躲在里面。但是当他们走出围篱，到溪边去取水的时候，往往被游击队打死。
    北部分为越北联区和第三联区，人口约七百余万。第三联区包括红河三角洲地区在内，是北部人口集中的富庶区域。红河三角洲上到处水田纵横，大米产量仅次于南部平原。
    越北联区东、西、北三面都是大山和森林，在高平、芒街一带及沿海岛屿，矿产极丰，往往露出地面。这里是越南人民的主要抗战根据地。一九五○年高平谅山战役之前，法国侵略者控制着第三联区的大部分城市，但越南人民军及人民武装在农村广泛地发动与坚持着游击战争。在越北联区法军仅占领东北边境第四号公路上自高平至谅山间的一些断断续续的线和点。西北边境，则老街、山罗、莱洲等城市完全处于孤立的被包围状态。
    现在，我们回顾一下越南人民的抗战历史。
    一九四六年十一月，法国政府撕毁了“三六协定”与法越临时协定，在谅山和海防进行了突然的袭击。十二月十九日，更从围攻河内开始，对越南发动全面进攻。越盟号召全民奋起抗战，提出“保存主力，限制敌人发展”和“截击敌军，保卫后方”的口号。在河内打了三个月，在南定打了两个月，切断了河内、海防之间的第五号公路，使敌人六十多天不能运输。这样争取了时间，从容撤退到越北联区的山林地带，整顿武装力量，建立游击根据地。一九四七年三月，法国殖民者调动兵力，在北部集中五万人，巩固大城市的占领，并积极向外扩展，攻占一些中小城市和交通路线，企图“速战速决”，消灭越南人民武装的主力。针对着敌人的阴谋，越南人民武装以“大队（连）独立，小团（营）集中”和“变敌人后方为我前线”等行动口号，使用一定力量的部队，分散到乡间进行武装宣传，建立群众工作的基础，发展游击战争。另外的主力，仍集中起来，阻击敌人的进攻。这就是越南抗战第一阶段——敌进我退的阶段。
    一九四七年十月，法国殖民者发动一次对越北的大进攻，使用兵力一万，结果被越人民军歼灭了三千多，狼狈地逃回河内。从此也就开始了越南抗战的第二阶段——相持阶段。
    越军总部的朋友说，在相持阶段里法国殖民者的主要阴谋是“政治分化和经济封锁”。他们首先挑拨民族仇恨，企图分而治之，他们成立了许多傀儡自治国：南部“南圻自治国”，中部“曼自治国”和北部山罗莱洲的“泰自治国”等，并且利用宗教，造谣宣传越盟烧教堂、杀教士。指使教徒中的反动分子，组织反革命武装。另一方面制造傀儡伪政权，先是在南北分别进行，南部以越奸阮文听、李文域为首，北部以阮有志为首。最后才抬出为全越人民所唾弃的保大皇帝，建立“统一”的伪政权。同时还组织伪军，加紧特务活动，实行恐怖的屠杀。在经济方面，企图扩大并巩固对矿区（东北）及米和树胶产地（中洲及南部）的控制，加紧掠夺，供应侵略战争。另一方面向解放区进行扫荡，提出一个最阴险毒辣的口号：“打越盟的胃”。
    一九五○年初，法军向北部第三联区太平省发动一次大扫荡。我的朋友给我介绍了当时曾亲历其境的一位越南女共产党员美大姐。她是一个典型的越南知识妇女，今年二十多岁，丈夫是人民军的干部，新婚后第三天，就因军事任务离开了她。当法军扫荡太平的时候，她领导地方妇女，协助部队抵抗。太平沦陷后，法国人要搜捕这个女共产党员。经过九死一生，她终于逃脱了兽性敌人的魔掌。她奉命撤离敌占区，沿着稻田边，爬近法军的封锁线，这样来回一天又一天地伏在那里，半个月之后才得到机会，越过敌人的哨岗，逃了出来。
    美大姐从介绍那边的一般情况开始，对我叙述这一场残酷的扫荡。
    太平省在河内东南，位于红河东岸，号称第三联区的谷仓。海防、河内、南定、海阳等大城市疏散出来的民众，集中在这一带地方的有两三百万。法军分三路从兴安、南定、建安向太平包围进攻。随军还带着一批流氓和受骗的宗教徒，每到一处，即放纵他们大肆劫掠奸淫，企图制造越南人民之间的仇恨和残杀。殖民统治者打进一个村庄，把民众的财产抢光烧光。粮食太多，他们只能带走一部分，余下的就倒进池塘里去，或者放火烧掉。耕牛被一群群地牵走；赶牲口到田里去践踏庄稼；青年人和干部家属被捆绑起来，整千整百地集体扫射；光天化日下，在街上公开强奸妇女。谈到这里，美大姐显得非常激动，她说：“这一带村镇的姐妹们，连孕妇，老太婆和十几岁的女孩子都遭受了惨无人道的摧残，多少姐妹因为倔强反抗被他们杀死了！”
    当太平被扫荡的消息传到越北联区时，正在整训准备总反攻的越南战士们被怒火燃烧得发疯，他们再也忍耐不住了，纷纷向上级请愿，要求立即开到前方去为第三联区的同胞报仇。
    中国人民的胜利使法帝国主义者非常恐慌，他们在北部集中了越南法军全部兵力的百分之四十六，积极进行对越南人民的侵略。美帝也加紧进行对越南的所谓“援助”，派遣军事顾问团，通过法军或直接供给保大以大量武装弹药。然而，不管帝国主义者怎样狼狈为奸，对于所谓“防务”怎样处心积虑，一九五○年的秋天，英勇的越南人民军在东北边界终于全部歼灭了法军九个营，其中包括其属于机动部队的最精锐的三个打波营（黑人），属于防御部队的最精锐的两个欧洲雇佣军营，还有一个被法国殖民者奉为至宝，专门用以救急的，由希特勒的近卫军俘虏编成的伞兵营。法国殖民统治者被打得手忙脚乱，连远在数百里外，隔着丛山峻岭的西北战场上的老街都慌忙撤退了。这样，法军在中越边界的整个防御体系被打垮了。现在，包括北部法军的心脏——红河三角洲产粮区已经暴露在越军面前。看吧，一九五一年将是越南抗战形势整个儿扭转的一年。
                                          一九五○年十二月二十七日
