Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 12th: The state-owned Central South China Textile Company has overfulfilled its raw cotton purchase task for the fourth quarter of 1950, acquiring 453,082 dan of raw cotton, exceeding the plan by a strong 22.6%. Part of this raw cotton has now been allocated to state-owned and private yarn factories in the Central South region for processing and spinning on commission; another part has been transferred to the Southwest, East China and other regions under central unified allocation.

After strict management was implemented in the cotton markets of the Central South region starting last November, the chaotic situation that had once occurred was overcome, and cotton prices were basically stabilized. Cotton distribution markets in Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Shashi, and other places have successively organized joint public-private raw cotton purchasing committees or cotton exchanges under the leadership of local industrial and commercial administrative departments, so that cotton transactions have gradually become normal. Wuhan's fourteen public and private cotton purchasing units also formed a raw cotton joint purchasing committee on November 4th, and Wuhan's 110 private cotton merchants formed a cotton industry joint management committee, signing a three-month cotton purchasing contract with the Central South China Textile Company, concentrating more than 35 billion yuan of private merchants' funds into cotton purchasing, selling it to the Textile Company. Based on protecting the interests of cotton farmers, the Textile Company gives private merchants reasonable profits in terms of fixed regional price differences, and provides necessary care in terms of capital turnover, ensuring a continuous supply of cotton from the countryside to Wuhan. Due to the implementation of these measures, in November and December, the Textile Company completed 50% more than the planned purchase task. In December, the raw cotton purchased by the Textile Company at all levels in the Central South region reached 80% of the total market transaction volume, an increase of 30% compared to October. Under the leadership of the Textile Company's listed prices, the grain-cotton price ratio and regional price differences of cotton in various markets have also become more reasonable. Currently, each jin of cotton can be exchanged for about eight jin of rice. In order to protect the interests of cotton farmers and reduce industrial production costs, the Textile Company has appropriately adjusted the listed prices in various places and reduced regional price differences. For example, the cotton price difference between Fancheng and Hankou has been reduced from the original 33.45% to 22.06% since late December of last year. According to the results of the Wuhan Commodity Inspection Bureau's inspection of cotton quality, the water and impurity content in October was 16.81%, which was reduced to 14.01% in December; the highest water and impurity content in October was 40.66%, which was reduced to 27.64% in December.

　　中南花纱布公司第四季购棉超过计划
    【新华社汉口十二日电】中南区国营花纱布公司已经超额完成一九五零年第四季度原棉收购任务，收购原棉四十五万三千零八十二担，超过计划百分之二十二点六强。这些原棉中的一部分现已拨交中南区各地公私营纱厂加工代纺；另有一部经中央统一调往西南、华东等地。
    中南各地棉花市场从去年十一月起实行严格管理后，克服了曾经一度发生的混乱情况，棉价基本稳定。武汉、郑州、长沙、沙市等地棉花集散市场，都先后在当地工商行政部门领导下，组织了公私原棉联购委员会或棉花交易所，使棉花交易渐趋正常。武汉市十四个公私购棉单位也于十一月四日组成原棉联购委员会，武汉市一百一十家私营棉商则组成棉业联营委员会，和中南区花纱布公司订立为期三个月的购棉合约，集中私商资金三百五十多亿元投入购棉，售与花纱布公司，在保护棉农利益的基础上，由花纱布公司在订定地区间差价方面予私商以合理利润，并在资金的周转方面予以必要照顾，保证乡间棉花能源源来汉。由于这些办法的实施，十一、十二两月，花纱布公司都超计划百分之五十完成了收购任务。中南全区各级花纱布公司十二月份所收购的原棉更达于市场总成交量百分之八十，比十月份增加百分之三十。各地市场粮棉比价及棉花的地区差价，亦在花纱布公司牌价的领导下趋于合理。目前，各地每斤棉花已可换到大米八斤上下。花纱布公司为保护棉农利益并降低工业生产成本，已适当调整了各地牌价，缩小地区差价。如樊城与汉口的棉花差价，自去年十二月下旬开始，已将原来相差百分之三十三点四五，缩小到百分之二十二点零六。棉花品质据武汉商品检验局检验的结果，十月份水杂百分之十六点八一，至十二月份减为百分之十四点零一；十月份水杂最高达百分之四十点六六，十二月份已减至百分之二十七点六四。
