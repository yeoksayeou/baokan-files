　　Love the Motherland, Defend the Motherland!
    ——Comprehensive Report on Students from All Over the Country Participating in Military Cadre Schools
    Duan Chengpeng Huang Zumin
    On December 1st and 2nd last year, students across the country recited the Central People's Government's decision to recruit students for military cadre schools and the call from the Communist Youth League Central Committee and the All-China Student Federation with extreme excitement. Cheers and applause reverberated in every school. Eye-catching large characters appeared on the wall newspapers: "The motherland has issued a call to us!" Many students immediately signed up to request recommendation and demanded the immediate establishment of a recommendation committee.

    At that time, various places were preparing to hold activities commemorating the "December 9th" Movement. The students remembered how the pioneers of the "December 9th" Movement went into the countryside, established anti-Japanese base areas with a few broken guns, endured hardships, and fought against our national enemies. And today, the People's Government has created the conditions for them to combine with the people's armed forces, handing over the most advanced national defense weapons such as airplanes, warships, and tanks, making it entirely possible for them to train themselves into glorious defenders of the motherland.

    Patriotic enthusiasm made countless students determined. Chen Shouen, a student at Peking University, wrote in his letter of determination: "My mother was burned alive by Japanese imperialists twelve years ago; although I have no mother now, the motherland is my dearest mother. I want to use the chest of a grown man, my hot blood, to defend the mother who raised me for eighteen years."

    The students deeply realized that under the threat of imperialist aggression, only by strengthening national defense can we guarantee the construction of our economy and culture.

    Countless glorious parents who encouraged their children to apply to military cadre schools emerged in all regions of the country. For example, Ling Zirun, a female professor at Shanghai Industrial College, was left with two sons, one four years old and one year old, when her husband died. It was not easy to raise them to adulthood, but today, she resolutely sent them to sign up. She said, "Chairman Mao loves young people, I believe in Chairman Mao, so I dedicate my two sons to the motherland." Zhang Zhengzhong's mother, who sells oranges in Chongqing, wrote in a letter: "I am very happy to hear that you want to apply for military cadre school, you can ask your sister to go with you! Be 'brother and sister joining the army.' Although your father is blind, I can still earn money to support you and your father, I will never delay your patriotic actions, go!" In Shanghai alone, 60 college and university teachers, including Fang Lingru, encouraged their children to apply. National industrialist Wu Yun wrote, "I certainly love my children, but I love the people's motherland even more. Love in a small circle should be extended to a greater and more noble love." He also sent his only son to sign up. Some parents initially disagreed with their children's application, but the students carried out resolute and patient persuasion work. In order to defend their parents and the parents of millions of others, they must participate in national defense construction. They advised their mothers to take Yue Fei's mother as an example. This will to dedicate themselves to the motherland finally moved many parents.

    In mid-December, enrollment committees were established in various places, and recommendation committees were established in various schools. Students flocked to sign up. At Shandong University, 514 people wrote down their names in two hours. Some students at Tsinghua University slept at the registration office before registering. Students registering at Shanghai Jiaotong University also waited all night, and in the early morning, the "logistics troops" sent soy milk and pancakes to comfort them.

    Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members played an exemplary leading role in the registration movement, and the majority of students actively participated. Guo Fuqi, a student at Peking University, initially regarded participating in military cadre schools as a matter for League members and had nothing to do with him. But in the upsurge of registration, he corrected his views and said, "Now I realize that the motherland is not just the motherland of League members, it is the motherland of every Chinese person. Every one of us Chinese sons and daughters has the responsibility to defend her and respond to her call."

    The young women of New China expressed their determination to defend the motherland: Among the more than 240 students who signed up at Beijing Agricultural University, there were 55 female students. The 21 female students who signed up at Northern Jiaotong University said they wanted to become "China's Dan Niang."

    Many young Christians and Catholics answered the imperialists' slanders against Chinese Christian and Catholic students with their actions. Chen Qiwen, a student at Qingxin Girls' High School, one of the church schools in Shanghai, said: "I am a Catholic, and all of us Chinese youth, regardless of religious belief, love our motherland. I resolutely sign up to participate in military cadre school." Ling Zipei, a Christian student at Hongkou Middle School in Shanghai, said when he signed up: "It is not truly patriotic for a Christian to let others shed blood while enjoying the blessings himself."

    The People's Republic of China is a large family of all nationalities, and students of all ethnic minorities are excited to participate in this patriotic movement. More than 240 Hui, Tibetan, and Mongolian students from various schools in Lanzhou have signed up. They unanimously expressed their response to the call of the motherland at a get-together. Ma Encai, a Hui student from Lanzhou Middle School who has already signed up, said at the meeting: "To build the motherland, we must first consolidate national defense. We youth of all ethnic groups must bravely participate in the cause of national defense construction. This is our glorious task."

    Overseas Chinese students, who have suffered greatly from imperialist persecution in the past, deeply feel the happiness of having a people's motherland today. Xie Bilian, an overseas Chinese student at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, shouted with grief and anger at a meeting to denounce the atrocities of American imperialism: "For the sake of the thousands of overseas Chinese families in deep waters, I resolutely participate in military cadre school!" Ant Jinzhong, a student at Peking University, lives in Siam. His father was killed by Japanese invaders in Siam for doing anti-Japanese work. He used to only hate the Japanese invaders, but now he realizes that imperialists are all the same. He donated all the two gold rings, three gold medals, and a gold chain that his mother gave him to the Korean people, and also signed up himself.

    The students who signed up were so widespread. Within a very short registration period, according to very incomplete statistics from East China, Central and South China, Southwest China, two provinces and five cities in North China, one city in Northwest China, and five schools in Changchun, more than 160,000 people had signed up. Among them, Beijing completed the registration work in five days. One-third of eligible students in Kunming wanted to participate in military school. Two-thirds of the students in Changchun and Jilin wrote letters of intent to participate in national defense construction. At Henan University and other institutions, the number of applicants reached 80% of the entire school.

    Students from different regions, different towns and villages, and public and private schools across the country are so eagerly hoping to take up positions defending the motherland. After signing up, many people were anxiously waiting for the announcement of the list of recommended students. The chairman of the student union of Beijing Mu Zhen Girls' High School fell ill with anxiety, and only recovered after learning of her approval. An excited crowd thronged in front of the wall where the list was posted, some trembling with tension, and jumping and shouting with joy when they saw their names. Look! The students came with gongs and drums and lit firecrackers, putting glorious red flowers on them, they were lifted up high. Slogans, applause, and cheers resounded in every school.

    Students who were not approved and who did not sign up all expressed at the farewell meeting that they would support the approved students by studying hard and doing their jobs well, and said: "When the motherland needs us again, we will definitely follow!"

    The action of students from all over the country participating in military cadre schools is a vivid manifestation of the expansion and deepening of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country. Millions of students received profound patriotic education in this unprecedentedly broad movement, and strengthened their determination to dedicate themselves to the people's motherland. At a time when the nation is suffering from foreign aggression and the country is in need, these educated youths are so resolutely combining with the people's armed forces, which is a brilliant manifestation of the Chinese students' revolutionary tradition.

　　热爱祖国，保卫祖国！
    ——全国各地学生参加军事干部学校情况综合报道
    段成鹏  黄祖民
    去年十二月一、二两日，全国各地学生以极其兴奋的心情朗诵着中央人民政府招收军事干部学校学生的决定和团中央、全国学联的号召。欢呼声与掌声在各校中翻腾着。墙报上出现了触目的大字：“祖国向我们发出了号召！”马上就有许多同学签名要求保送，要求赶快成立保送委员会。
    那时各地正准备举行“一二、九”纪念的活动，同学们记起了“一二、九”运动的先驱者如何走进农村，以几枝破枪建立起抗日根据地，历尽艰难，和我们民族敌人作斗争。而在今天，人民政府却为他们创造了与人民武装相结合的条件，把飞机、军舰、坦克等最先进的国防武器交付给他们，使他们完全有可能锻炼自己成为祖国的光荣保卫者。
    爱国主义的热情使成千累万的学生立定决心。北京大学陈守恩同学在决心书上写道：“我的母亲在十二年前被日本帝国主义者活活烧死；现在我虽然没有母亲，但祖国是我最亲爱的母亲。我要以长大成人的胸膛、我的热血来保卫养育我十八年的母亲。”
    同学们深刻地认识到，在帝国主义侵略的威胁下，只有加强国防建设，才能保证我们经济、文化的建设。
    在全国各地区涌现了无数鼓励子女报名的参加军事干校的光荣父母。如上海工专女教授凌子润，丈夫死时遗下两个儿子，一个四岁，一个一岁，好容易都培养成人，而今天，她毅然欢送他们去报名。她说：“毛主席爱护青年，我相信毛主席，所以我把两个儿子献给祖国。”重庆张正中同学卖橘子的母亲来信说：“听到你要投考军干校，我很喜欢，你约你妹妹一道去吧！做个‘兄妹从军’，你父亲虽双目失明，但我还能挣钱与你父糊口，我决不耽误你爱国的举动，去吧！”上海仅高等学校教师就有方令孺等六十人鼓励子女报名。民族工业家吴蕴初说：“我固然爱子女，更爱人民的祖国，小圈子的爱要推广到更大更崇高的爱。”他也送独子报名。也有一些父母最初不同意子女报名，但是同学们都进行了坚决耐心地说服工作。为了保卫他们的和千千万万人的父母，他们必须参加国防建设。他们劝告自己的母亲以岳飞的母亲作榜样。这种献身祖国的意志终于感动了许多家长。
    十二月中，各地成立了招生委员会，各校内成立了保送委员会，同学纷纷前去报名。山东大学在两个钟头内有五百一十四人写下自己的名字，清华大学有些学生在报名前就睡在报名处，上海交通大学报名学生也等了一夜，清晨，就有“后勤部队”送豆浆、大饼去慰劳。
    共产党员和青年团员在报名运动中起着模范带头作用，广大同学也积极参加。北大郭福祺同学最初把参加军事干部学校看作是团员的事，与他无关，但在报名的热潮中他改正了自己的看法，他说：“现在我认识到祖国并不只是团员们的祖国，她是每一个中国人民的祖国。我们每一个中华儿女都有责任保卫她，响应她的号召。”
    新中国的女青年表示了她们保卫祖国的决心：北京农业大学报名的二百四十多位同学中就有五十五个女同学，北方交通大学报名的二十一位女同学表示她们都要成为“中国的丹娘”。
    有不少青年的基督教、天主教徒，以他们的行动回答了帝国主义者对中国基督教天主教学生的诬蔑。上海教会学校之一的清心女中的陈绮文同学说：“我是一个天主教徒，我们全中国青年不分宗教信仰，都热爱着自己的祖国，我坚决报名参加军事干部学校。”上海虹口中学灵祖培同学是基督教徒，他在报名时说：“让别人流血，自己享福，就不是一个真正爱国的基督教徒。”
    中华人民共和国是各民族的大家庭，各少数民族学生都兴奋地参加这个爱国运动。兰州各校回、藏、蒙各族同学已有二百四十多人报名。他们在联欢会上一致表示响应祖国的号召。已经报名的兰州中学回族同学马恩才在会上说：“建设祖国，一定要先巩固国防，我们各族青年必须勇敢地参加国防建设事业，这是我们光荣的任务。”
    过去受尽了帝国主义迫害的华侨同学，深深感到今天有了人民祖国的幸福。广州中山大学华侨同学谢碧联，在控诉美帝暴行大会上，悲愤地大声疾呼：“为了千千万万在水深火热中的华侨家庭，我坚决参加军事干部学校！”北京大学蚁锦中同学家住暹罗，父亲做抗日工作在暹被日寇所杀，以前他只仇恨日寇，现在他认识帝国主义都是一路货，他把母亲交给他的两个金戒指、三块金牌，一条金链全部捐给朝鲜人民，自己也报了名。
    报名的同学是这样地广泛。在很短的报名期限内，根据华东、中南、西南三地区，华北二省五市，西北一市及长春五校很不完全的数字统计，已有十六万人以上报名。其中北京五天内就完成报名工作。昆明全市三分之一适龄学生要参加军校。长春、吉林二市三分之二学生写志愿书要参加国防建设。在河南大学等院校，报名者达全校百分之八十。
    全国不同地区、不同城镇乡村、公私立学校的学生正是这样热切地希望走上保卫祖国的岗位。报名以后，多少人在焦灼地等待保送名单公布。北京市慕贞女中学生会主席着急得病倒，知道批准后，病才好了。在公布名单的墙前拥挤着兴奋的人群，有的紧张得浑身发抖，看到自己的名字时，又高兴得直跳直嚷。看呵！同学们打响锣鼓、燃起爆竹走来了，把光荣的红花佩在他们身上，他们被高高地抬起来。口号声、掌声、欢呼声在各个学校里震响着。
    没有被批准和没有报名的同学都在欢送会上表示，要以学好功课，做好工作来支持已批准的同学，并且说：“祖国再需要我们的时候，我们一定跟上来！”
    各地学生参加军事干部学校的行动是抗美援朝保家卫国运动扩大与深入发展的一个生动的表现。千千万万的同学在这个空前广泛的运动中接受了深刻的爱国主义教育，坚定了他们为人民祖国献身的决心。在民族受外来侵略和国家需要时，这些知识青年如此坚决地与人民武装相结合，正是中国学生发扬革命传统的光辉表现。
