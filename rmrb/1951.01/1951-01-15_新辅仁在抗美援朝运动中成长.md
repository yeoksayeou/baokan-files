New Fu Jen University Grows in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

Fu Jen University President Chen Yuan

Fu Jen University has just passed three months since it expelled American aggressive forces on October 12th of last year and was taken over by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. In these three months, our school has shown a thriving scene of new life everywhere. Since the liberation of Beijing, our school's administrative power has been in our own hands, but financially, it was still restricted. Since the takeover, the economic constraints have also been completely liberated. The Chinese people themselves have become the masters of the school, and all teachers and students care for and care about the school more than before with the attitude of being masters. These facts are a powerful answer to the US imperialist conspiracy of aggression.

In these short three months, the school has made significant progress in all aspects. First, we put forward the slogan of running our own Fu Jen well, doing a good job in our profession, and doing a good job in our work. All teachers and students have entered a stage of intensifying study and intensifying work. The leaders of each department strengthened the tutoring of students' professional studies, and the professors formed teaching and research groups to discuss, observe, and exchange teaching experience with each other, absorb each other's advantages, and correct shortcomings, in order to improve the effectiveness of lectures and improve teaching methods.

The students have set off a high tide of learning, constantly maintaining a full learning mood, and consciously maintaining learning order and discipline. The seats in the library often cannot accommodate the students who study on their own, so classrooms are added for students to study and read on their own, which is a phenomenon that has never existed before.

The workers are also actively responsible and work hard for their own school. Especially the industrial workers, such as the printing department, have shown a new attitude of labor in their work. In the printing process of "People's China," sometimes some parts need to be reprinted due to revisions of important articles, and our workers work hard overnight to complete them on schedule, which has been praised by the International News Bureau of the News Administration.

Soon after the takeover, the trade union and student union were re-elected. After the re-election, the teachers and students clarified the future direction and tasks. The students guaranteed to do a good job in political and professional studies, and strengthen extracurricular recreational sports and various activities. After the reorganization of the trade union, it first strengthened political study. Teachers and staff members organized political study committees separately, and the teachers stipulated the study time according to the specific conditions of each department. In order to reduce the difficulties in the progress of work, the staff members stipulated that each group should study from 8:00 to 9:00 every morning. The workers systematically carried out political lectures every week, and the learning mood was mostly quite active.

Since the US imperialists landed in Incheon and invaded the area north of Pyongyang, we have felt the importance of current affairs learning, and began to shift from doing a good job in our profession to studying current affairs. The whole school universally and actively launched current affairs learning, organized reading groups, listened to reports, chatted, discussed, and made accusations against the US imperialist atrocities of aggression, which aroused deeper hatred of the US imperialists among teachers and students. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, all teachers and students enthusiastically took on various tasks and positions, carried out propaganda and mobilization work through various forms, and gave full play to their enthusiasm and creativity.

In early December, the government called on young students and workers to join military cadre schools. With a high degree of patriotism, the students rushed to sign up, expressing their willingness to dedicate everything to the safety of the motherland. This fully shows that the turned-over teachers and students of Fu Jen University have a clearer understanding, more hatred, and more resentment towards the US imperialist aggression, and stand firmly on the front line of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement with unparalleled strong confidence, and take out all their strength to fight to the end against the US imperialist aggression.

How can we exert such great strength in the anti-imperialist struggle? The most important point is that all teachers, staff, students, and workers in the school clearly recognize that this self-run recovery of our school is only to fight against imperialist elements, not against religion. We absolutely abide by the Common Program and guarantee the freedom of religious belief of teachers and students in the school. Under this correct goal, the religious friends wholeheartedly support the government's takeover, and many religious friends have expressed their hatred of imperialism and their support and gratitude for the government's takeover of Fu Jen. Library assistant Li Fengzhu is a religious friend. He said: "I solemnly declare from the standpoint of a religious person that anyone who uses religion as a cloak to carry out aggressive activities is our shame, and we should expose it." On such a basis of understanding, the religious friends and non-religious friends sincerely and closely unite and work hard to run the new Fu Jen well. Because they recognize that we are all Chinese, although we have different religious beliefs, our political demands are consistent; our love for the motherland and our unwillingness to be invaded by imperialism are consistent. After the takeover, the religious friends studied, worked, propagandized, and fought together with us against the US imperialists and protested against Austin's slander of the Chinese people.

Professor Zhang Derun of the Foreign Languages Department, a religious follower for many years, expressed her determination to resist America and aid Korea at the teachers' current affairs forum, and said: "Now I truly realize that imperialists running schools is indeed cultural aggression." Among the students who were approved to participate in military cadre schools, there were religious friends who said: "All Chinese people should love the motherland and obey the needs of the people, regardless of whether they believe in religion or not." The students of Fu Middle School who participated in the military cadre school included the children of Catholics in our school. These young people not only participated in the military cadre school themselves to respond to the call of the motherland, but also influenced and educated their parents, so that their parents' political understanding also improved. This shows that the religious friends and non-religious friends of Fu Jen are consistent in their hatred of the US imperialist aggression. After the takeover, the school's various measures can show that we have truly achieved absolute freedom of religious belief. Now the religious elective courses are still open there, and religious friends can freely choose to listen.

Recently, dozens of religious friends of Fu Jen, due to the gradual improvement of their understanding, and due to the accurate understanding of the internal and external environment of Chinese Catholicism, are brewing a "Three-Self" movement to express their high enthusiasm for loving the motherland, advocating breaking off all aspects of relations with imperialism, and establishing a new church of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. Zhang Hanmin, a religious friend of our school, said: "Only by following the Communist Party and overthrowing US imperialism can Fu Jen be reborn and the church be liberated!"

After the takeover, because teachers and students personally fought against the US imperialists in practice, not only was there a universal improvement in political ideology, but also preliminary reforms were made in school administration, curriculum, and system. There was also new progress in life, construction, addition of books, improvement of medical and sports equipment, and development of various departments. Each department has appropriately hired full-time professors and opened new courses to suit the needs of national construction.

In short, since Fu Jen truly belonged to the people, all teachers, staff, students, and workers have taken out the attitude of being masters, united as one, under the banner of Chairman Mao, and under the common goal of working hard for new democratic education, the religious friends and non-religious friends, and all colleagues and students, are closely united like a family, working together in various different positions to run the new Fu Jen well.

This fact shows that the State Council's measures on December 29th of last year to resolutely eliminate the influence of US imperialist cultural aggression in China are completely correct and necessary. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the Chinese people should sever all ties with the US imperialists. We can completely rely on our own strength to run schools and other various organs and organizations that were originally presided over by US imperialism. And it will definitely be better than before. The rapid growth of Fu Jen University in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is a very solid and powerful illustration.

　　新辅仁在抗美援朝运动中成长
    辅仁大学校长  陈垣
    辅仁大学自从去年十月十二日驱逐了美国侵略势力，由中央人民政府教育部接办后，到今天刚刚三个月，在这三个月里，我们学校到处呈现出新生的蓬勃景象。因我校自北京解放后，学校的行政权，已由我们自己掌握，但经费上，尚有牵制，自接管后，经济的束缚，也彻底地得到了解放。中国人自己作了学校的主人，全校师生都以主人翁的态度，对学校比前更加爱护和关心。这些事实，是对美帝侵略阴谋有力的回答。
    在这短短的三个月里，学校各方面，都有了显著的进步。首先，我们提出办好自己的辅仁，搞好业务，搞好工作的口号，全校师生，进入加紧学习，加紧工作的阶段。各系领导上加强辅导同学的业务学习，教授们成立教研小组，彼此研讨观摩交换教学经验，互相吸取优点，纠正缺点，以期提高讲课效能，改进教学方法。
    同学们掀起了学习高潮，经常的保持着饱满的学习情绪，自觉的维持学习秩序和纪律。图书馆的座位，经常容纳不下自学的同学们，于是加辟教室，作为同学们自习阅读之用，这是从来所没有的现象。
    工人们也积极负责，为自己的学校，努力工作，尤其是产业工人，如印刷部，在工作中表现了新的劳动态度，我们承印“人民中国”的印刷过程中，有时因为重要文章有修改，以致一部分须要重印，而我们的工人，连夜突击，依然如期完成，曾得到新闻总署国际新闻局的表扬。
    就在接管后不久，工会和学生会改选，改选后，师生们更明确了今后的方针和任务，同学们保证把政治与业务学习搞好，并加强课外的文娱体育及各种活动。工会改组后，首先加强政治学习，教职工分别组织政治学习委员会，教员们按各系的具体情况，来规定学习时间。职员们为了减少工作进行上的困难，规定每天上午八时到九时，各小组学习。工人们每星期有系统地进行政治课讲授，学习的情绪，大部分都是相当积极的。
    自美帝在仁川登陆，侵入平壤以北地区后，我们感到时事学习的重要，开始由搞好业务，转向学习时事，全校普遍地积极地展开时事学习，组织读报小组，听报告，漫谈，讨论，并对美帝侵略暴行提出控诉，激起了师生们对美帝更深的仇恨。在抗美援朝运动中，全校师生热烈的担任了各种工作和职务，通过种种不同的形式，进行宣传鼓动工作，高度地发挥了积极性和创造性。
    十二月初，政府号召青年学生工人，参加军事干部学校，同学们以高度的爱国主义精神，争先恐后，报名参加，表示为了祖国的安全，愿献出自己的一切，这都充分说明了翻了身的辅仁师生，对美帝的侵略行为，更认识得清楚，更仇视更愤恨，都以无比坚强的信心，坚决地站在抗美援朝运动的前线，并拿出所有的力量，为反对美帝侵略而斗争到底。
    我们在反帝斗争中，何以能够发挥这样大的力量呢？最重要的一点，就是全校教职学工都明确认识到，我们学校这次收回自办，只是和帝国主义分子作斗争，而不是反对宗教。我们绝对遵守共同纲领，保障在校师生的信教自由。在这个正确的目标下，教友们都衷心拥护政府接办，很多教友都表示了他们对帝国主义的愤恨，并对政府接办辅仁表示拥护和感激，图书馆助理员李凤竹是一位教友，他说：“我以教徒的立场郑重声明，任何利用宗教作外衣，进行侵略活动的，都是我们的耻辱，我们应当揭穿它。”他们就在这样的认识基础上，诚心诚意的，教友和非教友都紧密团结，为办好新辅仁而努力。因为他们认清了我们都是中国人，尽管宗教信仰不同，而我们的政治要求是一致的；我们爱祖国，不愿受帝国主义的侵略是一致的。接管后，教友们都和我们共同学习，共同工作，共同宣传，共同为反对美帝，抗议奥斯汀对中国人民的诬蔑而奋斗。
    外语系教授张德润先生，是多年的教徒，她在教员时事座谈会上表明自己抗美援朝的决心，并且说：“现在我才真正认识到帝国主义办学校，的确是文化侵略。”在被批准参加军事干部学校的同学中，就有教友在内，他们表示：“凡是中国人民，就要爱祖国，就要服从人民需要，不分信教不信教。”辅中参加军干校的同学，有我校天主教徒的子女，这些青年的子女们，不但自己参加了军干校，以响应祖国号召，而且还影响了教育了他们的家长，使家长们的政治认识，也提高了一步。这说明了辅仁的教友与非教友，对美帝国主义侵略行为的仇恨是一致的。接管后，学校的各种措施，都可以看出我们真正作到了宗教信仰绝对自由，现在宗教的选课，还是开在那里，教友们可以自由选听。
    最近辅仁的几十位教友，由于认识的逐渐提高，由于确切的认识了中国天主教的内外环境，为了表示他们高度的爱祖国的热情，正在酝酿“三自”运动，主张与帝国主义割断各方面的关系，建立自治、自养、自传的新教会。我校教友张汉民表示：“只有跟着共产党走，打倒美帝国主义，辅仁才能获得新生，教会才能获得解放！”
    接管后，因为师生们亲自与美帝作了实际斗争，不但在政治思想上，普遍的提高；而且在校政方面，课程方面，制度方面，也都作了初步的改革，在生活上，在建设上，在图书的添置上，在医药体育设备的改进上，以及各系的发展方面，都有了新的进步。各系都在为了适合国家建设的需要，适当地添聘了专任教授，开了新的课程。
    总之，自从辅仁真正的属于人民以后，全校教职学工，都拿出了主人翁的态度，团结一致，在毛主席的旗帜下，在为新民主主义教育努力的共同目标下，教友与非教友，与全体的同仁同学，紧密团结得像一家人，在各个不同的职务上，共同为办好新辅仁而努力。
    这事实说明了，政务院在去年十二月二十九日坚决肃清美帝在中国的文化侵略影响的措施，是完全正确，而且必要的。中国人民在中央人民政府的领导之下，应该斩断与美帝一切有关的缰索，我们完全可以依靠自己的力量来办好学校和其他各种原来由美帝国主义主持的机关团体。并且一定会办得比原来更好，辅仁大学在抗美援朝运动中迅速地成长起来，就是一个很坚实有力的说明。
                                              一九五一年一月十一日
