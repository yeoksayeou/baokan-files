Reaction to Criticism from the People's Daily

To the Editor:

After reading the letter "Hebei Provincial People's Court Revokes Original Judgment of Zhengding County Government, Changes Sentence of Local Tyrant Landlord Fang Luoyu to Death" published in the People's Daily on December 27th, we believe that the handling by the Hebei Provincial People's Court was very correct. Although the Zhengding County People's Government has made a self-criticism regarding the improper handling of this case, the self-criticism did not mention what kind of punishment the negligent cadres involved in this case received. We believe that the government should give the negligent cadres who so carelessly sentenced counter-revolutionaries the necessary punishment and announce it in the newspaper. In this way, the educational effect on judicial cadres in various regions will be even greater.

### 正定县人民法院失职干部应受到适当的处分

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　正定县人民法院失职干部应受到适当的处分编辑同志：
    看了十二月二十七日人民日报所刊“河北省人民法院撤销正定县府原判，改处恶霸地主房洛雨死刑”的信后，我们认为河北省人民法院的处理是很正确的。正定县人民政府对处理这个案件的不当，虽然作了检讨；但在检讨中却没有提到有关此案的失职干部，受到了怎样的处分。我们认为：这样轻率地判处反革命分子的失职干部，政府应该给以必要的处分，并在报上公布。这样，对各地司法干部所起的教育作用将更大。
