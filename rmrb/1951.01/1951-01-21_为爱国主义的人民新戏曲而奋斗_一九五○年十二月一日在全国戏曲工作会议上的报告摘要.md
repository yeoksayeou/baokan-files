　　Striving for New Patriotic People's Opera
    ——Summary of a Report at the National Opera Work Conference on December 1, 1950
    Tian Han
    Fellow representatives:
    The National Opera Work Conference was planned to be convened several months ago. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government attaches great importance to this cultural undertaking, which is related to the education and entertainment of the broad masses of the people and connects the professional lives of hundreds of thousands of artists. Premier Zhou emphasized at the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers:
    "In the future, we must unite with all old artists in the country who are willing to reform, organize them, lead them, and extensively carry out large-scale reforms of old literature and art... The huge force of the old literature and art troops, which includes hundreds of thousands of artists and influences tens of millions of audiences, listeners, and readers, should be mobilized to actively participate in this reform movement."
    How has this reform movement progressed in the past year or so?
    In the past year, local opera reform work has achieved good results in the large-scale revision and writing of scripts and librettos. For example, Beijing has compiled and revised about a hundred kinds of Peking Opera and Ping Opera, and newly composed one hundred and twenty sections of Quyi. In Tianjin, forty-nine new scripts have been produced in the past seventeen months, accounting for 38% of the performed programs. Shanghai has written 133 kinds of Yue Opera, 51 kinds of Hu Opera, 33 kinds of Peking Opera, and a total of 346 kinds including other Yong Opera and Huaiyang Opera. Due to the mass adaptation movement launched in the Northeast, the results have been great. A total of 412 kinds of Peking Opera have been adapted, 642 kinds of Ping Opera have been adapted, 443 kinds of Quyi have been revised, 237 kinds of Peking Opera have been created, 233 kinds of Ping Opera have been created, and 985 kinds of Quyi have been created and performed. The Central South has compiled and revised 119 kinds of scripts. Xi'an and Lanzhou have created 37 kinds of new scripts, revised 70 kinds of old scripts, and adapted 60 kinds of Quyi. They have collected and transcribed more than 600 kinds of scripts and more than 400 kinds of Quyi scripts. Chongqing has adapted more than ten kinds of Sichuan Opera, and the artists have self-compiled anti-local tyrant operas based on real people and events in Chongqing, with good results. Kunming, Yunnan, has newly compiled five kinds of Dian Opera and fifty kinds of Flower Lantern Opera. Although new operas cannot fully meet the needs of the audience in terms of quantity and quality, and its audience is far less than that of old operas, it has been welcomed by the broad masses of the audience and has become the leading force in opera activities.

    In terms of the unity and education of artists, artist training classes or artist schools have been held in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing and other places for one to three terms. It is estimated that about 50,000 artists have participated in the study.

    Due to the improvement of the status of artists in the new country and the progress of their thinking, artists have actively participated in various social and political activities. Artists from all over the country have enthusiastically participated in activities such as comforting the army, relieving disasters, unemployment, soliciting public bonds and winter clothes, supporting the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and responding to the peace signature campaign. In particular, the current movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea has been enthusiastically responded to.

    These remarkable achievements are not only due to the efforts of comrades in various places, but also to the general improvement of the awareness of the broad masses of artists, so they can voluntarily contribute their strength to the motherland and the people.

    However, these achievements are not balanced in various places. The Ministry of Culture of the Central Government has not yet issued formal instructions on the policy of opera reform, and deviations inevitably occur in the understanding and implementation of opera reform work in various places. The most prominent is reflected in the issue of banned operas. Many places have no standards for banned operas, and there are many over-leftist tendencies, or the lives of artists are difficult due to too many banned operas, or mass dissatisfaction is caused by compulsory orders. On the other hand, in some places, there has been a phenomenon of completely letting go of the bad content in old operas without reforming them. Although many new and excellent works have been produced in the revision and adaptation of scripts, there are also many scripts that are dogmatic and anti-historical, and therefore cannot achieve the effect of correctly educating the masses and being loved by the masses.

    Due to the above situation, we are prepared to clarify the following guiding issues concerning drama reform work at this conference:
  1. The Issue of Opera Review
    The main purpose of opera review is to evaluate old operas from the standpoint of new democratic nationalism, science, and the people, and to distinguish their benefits or harms to the people in order to praise or criticize and choose. Operas that can promote the spirit of new patriotism and revolutionary heroism, help resist aggression, defend peace, promote human justice, resist oppression, and strive for democracy and freedom should be specially commended and promoted. For the bad content in old operas, the cultural and educational authorities in various places should cooperate with the artists to revise them, and in general, they should try to eliminate the toxins in them and retain the original repertoire, and do not easily adopt the method of banning or suspending performances. When reviewing old operas, attention should be paid to the difference between superstition and mythology, because many myths are the naive fantasies of ancient people about natural phenomena, or protests against the old society and the pursuit of an ideal world. This kind of mythology is not only harmless but also beneficial to the new society. Only writing about the underworld and reincarnation to scare the people is harmful. The second is to distinguish between love and licentiousness. Plays that write about love between men and women, such as "The West Chamber," which exposes feudal oppression through the relationship between men and women, should not be opposed. Only deliberately performing these plays in an obscene and vulgar manner to cater to the low-level tastes of the audience should be opposed. Because that objectively spreads feudal toxins and blurs the audience's healthy understanding of gender issues. Many insulting and poisonous performances on the stage that harm the working people, extremely ugly, obscene, barbaric, and terrifying performances such as foot binding and torture, must be resolutely eliminated. Here is the combination of script review and performance image review.

    The cultural and educational authorities in various places should pay close attention to the programs performed in theaters. Although the bad content of operas should not be changed too hastily, it should not be delayed without changing it. It is necessary to cooperate closely with the artists and review and revise them together from the script to the performance. Since the decision is made by the opera industry itself, our reviewed "final version" must be more authoritative and easier to perform. Old scripts that are indeed seriously harmful and difficult to modify should be submitted to the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government for a final decision and should not be handled arbitrarily. The banning of old repertoires must be reported to the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government for approval before it can be implemented. Released repertoires must not be arbitrarily delayed.
  2. The Issue of Opera Revision and Creation
    Our opera reform focuses on revising old scripts and their performance images to try our best to preserve their original repertoire. We do not adopt the method of complete negation or laissez-faire. Because as new Chinese who love the motherland and the people, we must love the cultural heritage passed down by our ancestors and loved by the people. The highly original Chinese old drama form is one of this precious heritage. Some people simply regard old dramas as something that served emperors, nobles, gentry, and landlords in the feudal era and negate them altogether, and advocate so-called "complete Europeanization." This is exactly what the bourgeois worldism promoted by US imperialism today requires. They want to take away our national self-esteem and self-confidence and make us surrender spiritually to US imperialism, which is trying to dominate the world. It should be known that the feudal era was not only for emperors, nobles, gentry, and landlords, but also for the working people. All art, like all other cultures, is the accumulation of the wisdom and labor of the people. Under feudal rule, it is inevitable that it will be influenced by feudalism, but we can still hear the great pulse of the people from it. Lenin said: "In the national culture of every era, there are democratic and socialist elements, even if this element is not developed. Because in every era, every nation, as long as there are working masses and exploited masses, their living conditions will inevitably produce democratic and socialist ideas, at least the budding ideas of democratic socialism." (See Lenin's "On Art and Culture") Therefore, the wise inheritors of our national cultural heritage "must distinguish between all the decadent things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent ancient folk culture, that is, things that are somewhat democratic and revolutionary." And "remove its feudal dross and absorb its democratic essence." (See Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy" Section 15) This is the critical acceptance of heritage, which is a necessary condition for promoting a new national culture. At the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Premier Zhou answered well about the question of old literature and art: "All the bad parts of old literature and art, all the parts that are not suitable for the interests and requirements of the people will definitely be eliminated, such as things that promote feudal ideas and other counter-revolutionary ideas should be eliminated; in addition, some rational and developable things will slowly improve and progress and gradually become a component of new literature and art." Now our treatment of the old opera heritage is mainly based on revision. It is not just a temporary "utilization". It is not a question of abandoning it after "utilization", but a question of carrying on the past and opening up the future in culture. We want to make the old form serve the people quickly, and in this service make it slowly improve and progress. Our revision gradually progresses from content to form. Revision is "criticism" and also a kind of "creation". Don't regard revision and creation as completely opposed. In fact, good revision is also creation. People who modify old locomotives to make them serve the people again are respected as labor heroes. What is not creation if the old opera is modified to fully meet the needs of the people and obtain new artistic life? Of course, we must also organize a lot of creation, especially for those emerging opera genres such as Ping Opera, Chu Opera, Yue Opera, and Hu Opera. We must rely on new scripts as the main nutrition.

    Our steps in revising old dramas are first to carry out the most necessary disinfection, that is, to discard the harmful, decadent, and backward parts that are harmful to the people, such as the parts that promote slave thinking, cruelty, terror, barbarism, and backwardness, and preserve and absorb the healthy and progressive parts that are beneficial to the people, and inherit them as excellent traditions, and develop them on the basis of new democracy. In this way, the old national drama art will become a new people's opera, and become an important part of the new literature and art.

    It is generally believed that the old Chinese drama form is more suitable for expressing historical stories. Taking Peking Opera as an example, according to incomplete statistics ten years ago, the most numerous of all old repertoires are Three Kingdoms dramas, with 23 kinds; followed by Eastern Zhou Dynasty dramas with 21 kinds; Water Margin dramas with 20 kinds; Northern Song Dynasty Yang Family Generals with 18 kinds; Three Heroes and Five Righteousnesses with 13 kinds; Shi Gong'an with 13 kinds; Conquest of the East with 12 kinds; Five Dynasties and Tang Dynasty with 11 kinds; Saying Yue with 11 kinds; Flying Dragon Biography with 10 kinds; Dream of the Red Chamber with 9 kinds; Eastern Han with 9 kinds; Investiture of the Gods with 9 kinds; Biography of Heroes with 9 kinds; Peng Gong'an with 8 kinds; Western Han with 7 kinds; Ancient and Modern Wonders with 6 kinds; Journey to the West with 8 kinds; Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio with 5 kinds. Indeed, the old drama has popularized the history of the Chinese nation, but a large part of it has been distorted and reversed. This is what Chairman Mao said: "History is created by the people, but in the old stage, the people have become dregs, and the stage is ruled by masters, wives, young masters, and young ladies." Our task today is to restore the original face of history from the concealment and distortion of the past feudal ruling class, and to find the real master on the historical stage. Reflect historical reality from the viewpoint of historical materialism, convey historical lessons, and commend the progressiveness, humanity, and noble national qualities of historical heroes under the historical conditions at that time, in order to educate and encourage future generations. But we should not modernize historical figures rigidly, and should not make inappropriate comparisons between the deeds of spontaneous peasant wars in history and the deeds of modern people's revolutionary struggles. Because it was impossible to have the proletariat, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao in the past history.

    We should adopt a historical view of historical figures. No matter whether he is an emperor, general, civil or military official, or a scholar..., as long as his actions are in line with the highest interests of the people in the historical stage at that time, we will commend him in the same way. There are so many great achievements, strange festivals, great courage, and hidden virtues of our ancestors that are beneficial to the people and the nation, which are enough to increase our national self-confidence and self-esteem. But this kind of commendation should be appropriate and should not "idealize" the feudal class. We say that returning history to history is not for history for the sake of history. We show historical reality in order to educate and encourage future generations. There must be an organic link between historical dramas and the current reality struggle. For example, the ancient flow of rivers cannot be cut off and cannot be isolated.

    Therefore, many people are accustomed to calling "modern dramas" "reality dramas" in contrast to "historical dramas," which is inappropriate. Good historical dramas, like good modern dramas, express realistic content. Bad modern dramas, despite being in fashion, can be unrealistic.

    Folklore often has a kind of beauty of human childhood that is not easy to imitate but easy to destroy. Attention should also be paid to revising such scripts and not destroying them easily.

    In addition to dealing with historical themes, the people ask our writers and actors to deal with themes that reflect the current reality more, to express the struggle life and great creation of the modern people, and to portray the vivid images and spiritual style of modern people's heroes. All places should regularly organize and promote such creations.

    In addition, new Peking Opera and new local operas are generally long. It is not easy for small local troupes to perform, and it is not easy to be universal. We should write more short, concise, and combative scripts so that all kinds of troupes in various places can perform them at any time.
  3. The Key Issues of Opera Reform
    Here we specifically mention the key issues of opera reform.

    The "People's Daily" published on November 13, 1948, had the following words in the special article "Carry out the Reform of Old Dramas in a Planned and Step-by-Step Manner":

    "...In addition to Peking Opera, special emphasis should be placed on the reform of local operas in the revision object. There are many repertoires of various local operas, and they should be collected in a planned and organized manner. Many of these operas are taught orally and remain in the minds of folk artists. They should be recorded, studied, reviewed and revised. The excavation of this part of the heritage will be extremely valuable for the reform and construction of China's national new opera."

    In fact, the rich life symbols and unlimited talent and wisdom of the Chinese nation are still buried in the local arts of all parts of the country! During the Anti-Japanese War, we traveled all over the southeast and southwest, and saw the same script performed in various places, but the methods and styles were all different. With the universal establishment of the people's regime, we can no longer let these cultural treasures be buried and lost without being promoted. It's time! In addition to continuing to reform Peking Opera, we should focus on the reform of local operas, and carry out a universal reform of local operas and the budding operas of various ethnic minorities in a planned and organized manner, and strive for the "blooming of hundreds of flowers" of various opera arts across the country!

    Here it must be pointed out that there are two categories of local opera, one is the local big opera, such as Qin Opera, Hui Opera, Han Opera, Sichuan Opera, Xiang Opera, Dian Opera, Shaoxing Dabao, etc. The ten lines of roles are relatively complete, focusing on old men, green clothes, clowns, and nets. They generally move and perform historical stories, generally inheriting the tradition of Kunyi and becoming the predecessor of Peking Opera. One is folk small operas, such as the currently popular Ping Opera (Bengbeng), Yue Opera (Diduban), Hu Opera (Shentan), Chu Opera (Hubei Flower Drum Opera, Hunan Flower Drum Opera is also called Chu Opera), Yunnan Flower Lantern Opera, etc. The roles are mainly young men, young women, and clowns, the so-called "three smalls". The tunes are simple and generally only perform family stories, social scenes, especially love between men and women, etc. In the past, they were called "Flower Drum Obscene Plays" by the literati and were mostly performed in the mountains and fields at night. In the north, such as Ping Opera, in the south of the Yangtze River, such as Yue Opera, Hu Opera, and in central China, such as Chu Opera, etc., have all made great strides in recent years and become big operas. Local big operas such as Han Opera and Sichuan Opera, the scripts are mostly the same as Peking Opera, and the stylized performance methods are also the same. However, because they are scattered in various places, the degree of courtization is not deep, and they are combined with local art, and they still preserve more folk elements. For example, local operas often use clowns to dress up as emperors, satirizing the licentiousness and shamelessness of feudal rulers to the fullest extent, which is rare in Peking Opera. The opera "Eight Great Nabs," which suppressed folk rebellions, is also not found in local operas. Another example is that the Xiang Opera "Nao Jiang" and "Killing Xi" can mostly express the tough character of the local people. The Sichuan Opera "Qiujiang" writes about the shoals and waters of the Sichuan River, as well as the labor life of the boatmen, which are extremely realistic. Another example is the more reasonable disposal of characters and stories by local operas, such as Qin Opera's "Qing Dingzhu" for Xiao En and Yuzhi (Guiying), and Sichuan Opera's "Dao Tan" for Yang Silang. Another example is the same "Dumb Man Carrying a Madman", Dian Opera and Sichuan Xiang Opera each have their own characteristics. Therefore, it is very necessary to deeply explore the richer people's components in local operas and folk operas, and the more vivid and simple performance forms, for the development of drama education and the promotion of drama and art reform.

    Here it must also be pointed out that opera art is constantly developing. In the process of development, folk small operas must learn from big operas and try to absorb their strengths to strengthen themselves. After growing stronger, they originally only performed love stories and social scenes, but later they also performed large historical dramas.

    The development of various different local song and dance dramas in China has roughly the same path, and they influence each other, which determines the common characteristics of Chinese national opera. It is also inappropriate to completely oppose Peking Opera and local opera without paying attention to the development path of Chinese opera and their mutual influence.

    The development of the vast local operas is uneven, and some are still quite primitive and rough, and need to be enriched and improved by the state in a planned and unified manner.

    We have now decided to do this: (1) Local opera reform work will take the opera genres that have the greatest impact on the local masses as the main reform object. (2) Local cultural and educational authorities and opera improvement institutions should invite local opera veterans and important actors to participate in and jointly lead the improvement work. And set up local opera schools under possible conditions to cultivate the next generation of actors and opera reform cadres. (3) Widely collect, record, and publish local opera folk drama scripts for research and improvement. (4) Hold a national opera competition performance every year to showcase the improvement achievements of local operas and various ethnic dramas, reward their excellent works and performances, and guide their development direction.
  4. The Issue of Unity and Learning of Artists
    The vast number of professional artists across the country are literary and art workers with a broad mass base and are also a part of the working people. Just like the artists in ancient Greece were mostly born as slaves, only poor children went to study opera in old China. Although they are actually the bearers of national opera culture, because most of the artists are "young and unschooled", and the opera industry is regarded as "minor skills" and "lowly industry" by feudal rulers, the life of any famous artist is a life of insult and damage. Now, with the liberation of the people and the establishment of the new China, the artists have turned over, their status has been improved, and yesterday's "high platform education" has become "teachers who educate the people with art". How should we respect these teachers of the people! Respecting teachers means respecting the Tao. Since the country will improve the political awareness of the broad masses of the people and encourage their labor and fighting enthusiasm through the vivid art of the artists, how can we not respect them? Their art is loved by the people, and the people love them and need them. If we do not respect them, or even repeat the attitude of the old society towards artists, then we are not respecting the people. The ancients said: "What the people like, like it". Not respecting artists and uniting artists means going against what the people like, and means being divorced from the people. On the other hand, as far as the artists are concerned, their status has been improved and their responsibilities have also increased. The little skills they had before cannot cope with today's new situation. After the national land reform, the social foundation has changed, and the quality of the audience and listeners has also changed, and their thoughts and tastes are different from before. They come to the theater and teahouse with a noble and serious spirit. They have further requirements for the performers and their materials. If your art cannot satisfy them, or if there are deviations in the content of your art, they will give you opinions. Therefore, it is not too easy to take on the responsibility of this "teacher of the people". What to do? In Chairman Mao's words, "Only by being students of the masses can we be teachers of the masses." Therefore, it is very necessary to step up the learning of necessary culture, learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and improve business to the extent that it is beneficial to the people.

    As early as 1944, Chairman Mao taught us to form a "united front of new forms and old forms", and taught us to apply the two major principles of the united front: unity and criticism, or education and transformation, in this regard. He said: "It is wrong to surrender to the old form, and it is also wrong to exclude and despise it. Our task is to unite all available old forms and old artists and help to influence and transform them. In order to transform them, we must first unite them." (See Chairman Mao's "Instructions on the Policy of the Cultural Movement") At the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Premier Zhou further extended Chairman Mao's words and gave such instructions: "The old society's attitude towards old literature and art is both love and insult. They love the art of old content and old forms, but they also look down on old artists and always insult them. Now it is a new society and a new era. We should respect all old artists who are loved by the masses. Only by respecting them can we transform them."

    Respect is the question of unity, the question of the united front. Transformation is the question of criticism and education. This is not to lower our artists, but to raise our artists. In the past year, all major cities across the country have conducted education for artists in the form of training classes, cultural literacy classes, artist schools, opera forums, and competition performances. Such education should be continued and persevered. We should increase the vast number of artists' feelings for the country and awaken their patriotism and sense of responsibility to the new society through unity and education, so that they feel that their personal future and the future of the People's Republic are so closely linked: the country's future is bright, and their future will be bright. Therefore, more closely integrate their art with the current reality and serve the motherland's victory in nation-building and world lasting peace!

    The education and transformation of artists has already achieved preliminary results in improving the political awareness of artists, changing their lifestyle, reducing fatalistic thinking, awakening the spirit of unity and friendship, cultivating the ability to automatically compile and revise scripts, and establishing a new drama performance system. But it is undeniable that there are still some shortcomings, such as the fact that the educational arrangement plan and teaching methods are not completely suitable for the needs of artists. In the future, it should be improved so that the huge artist force becomes Chairman Mao's good students and revolutionary opera warriors! Some artists in various places have become glorious Communist Party members and members of the New Democratic Youth League through study; (for example, there are 205 Party and League members among artists in the Northeast. Many artists in Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Shanghai, Jinan and other places have joined the League and the Party.) Some have become opera reform cadres; some have joined the People's Liberation Army. Three artists in Shanghai have joined the volunteer army to aid Korea; some have participated in land reform. This shows that opera workers have moved in the direction of serving workers, peasants and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao. Only by adhering to this correct direction can the opera reform work achieve decisive achievements and make Chinese opera undergo a transformation and become an art truly needed by the people.

    To ensure the effective completion of the opera reform cause, it is necessary to launch the "united front of new forms and old forms" as instructed by Chairman Mao, that is, further unity and cooperation between new literature and drama workers and artists. The reform of old opera and the creation of new opera need not be completely regarded as one thing, but at least they are closely related to each other. The creation of new opera must be combined with and connected with the tradition of people's opera, such as the current new opera is mostly transformed from old Yangko opera, which is also a process of old form transformation and development. The success or failure of the reform of old opera directly affects whether the era of "new people's opera" will arrive sooner. We should awaken the vast number of new literary and art workers to the importance of and deepen their understanding of the opera reform cause. The mutual learning and cooperation between the two will guarantee the smooth resolution of the main specific issues of opera reform, such as the issue of script revision and creation, the issue of drama music and stage art improvement. Due to such cooperation, the boundary and separation between "new" and "old" will be gradually eliminated. Local opera reform institutions are responsible for regularly promoting this kind of unity and cooperation. We propose to abolish the title of "old artist" in the future, and only call them "artist" and "opera worker", because once the old artist is transformed, accepts the new outlook on life, and serves the people with his art, he becomes a "new artist." Just as old opera, whose content and form have been transformed, belongs to the category of "new literature and art."

    Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and art thoughts and the unified leadership of the cultural and educational authorities of the People's Government, relying on the full cooperation of new and old literary and art workers and the self-consciousness of the vast number of artists, the great historical task of reforming China's old opera and creating China's new song and dance drama will surely be completed smoothly.

　　为爱国主义的人民新戏曲而奋斗
    ——一九五○年十二月一日在全国戏曲工作会议上的报告摘要
    田汉各位代表：
    全国戏曲工作会议在几个月以前便已经计划召开了，在毛主席的英明领导之下，中央人民政府十分重视这一有关广大人民教育、娱乐，并联系着数十万艺人职业生活的文化事业。周总理在第一次全国文学艺术工作者代表大会上曾强调地说：
    “今后一定和全国一切愿意改造的旧艺人团结在一起，组织他们，领导他们，普遍地进行大规模的旧文艺改革。……应该使包含几十万艺人并影响几千万观众、听众、读者的旧文艺部队的巨大力量动员起来，积极地参加这个改革运动。”
    这一改革运动一年多以来开展得怎么样呢？
    一年来各地戏曲改革工作，在剧本唱本的大量修改编写方面，有很好的成绩：如北京编改京剧及评戏约百余种，新编曲艺一百二十段。天津市十七个月来，产生了四十九部新剧本，占演出节目百分之三十八。上海编写越剧一百三十三种，沪剧五十一种，京剧三十三种，连其他甬剧、淮扬剧等共达三百四十六种。东北因展开群众改编运动，收效甚大，计京剧改编四百十二种，评戏六百四十二种，修改的曲艺四百四十三种，京剧创作二百三十七种，评戏创作二百三十三种，创作的曲艺九百八十五种都曾演。中南编改剧本一百十九种。西安及兰州创作新剧本三十七种，修改旧剧本七十种，改编曲艺六十种。搜集与誊写剧本六百余种，曲本四百余种。重庆改编川剧十余种，艺人根据重庆真人真事自编反恶霸戏，效果甚好。云南昆明新编滇戏五种，花灯戏五十种。新戏曲虽然在数量和质量上还不能完全满足观众的需要，它的观众还远不及旧戏观众多，但它已经受到了广大观众的欢迎，成为戏曲活动的主导的力量。
    在艺人的团结和教育方面，北京、天津、上海、南京、武汉、重庆等地均举办了艺人讲习班，或艺人学校一期至三期，据估计，参加学习的艺人约有五万人。
    由于艺人在新的国家中地位的提高与他们思想上的进步，艺人积极参加了各种社会政治的活动。凡劳军，救济灾荒、失业，劝募公债、寒衣，拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约，响应和平签名等等，各地艺人都踊跃参加，特别是目前的抗美援朝运动，更争先恐后，风起云涌地热烈响应。
    这一些显著的成绩，固由于各地工作同志努力得来，也由广大艺人觉悟程度普遍提高，故能自愿自动地为祖国、为人民贡献自己的力量。
    但这些成就各地还不平衡。关于戏曲改革的方针，中央文化部还未发布正式的指示，各地对戏曲改革工作的认识和执行上就不免发生偏差，最突出的是表现在禁戏问题上，好些地方对禁戏漫无标准，多有过左偏向，或因禁戏过多，使艺人生活困难，或因强迫命令，引起群众不满。另一方面，有的地方，又发生了对旧戏中不良内容不加改革，完全放任自流的现象。在修改与改作剧本方面，虽然产生了不少新的优秀之作，但亦有许多剧本是公式主义的，反历史主义的，因而不能达到正确地教育群众与为群众爱好的效果。
    由于以上的情况，我们预备在这次大会上明确以下关于戏剧改革工作的几个方针性的问题：
  一、戏曲审定问题
    戏曲审查的主要目的在于从新民主主义的民族的、科学的、人民大众的立场评价旧戏曲，辨别其对人民的利或害以为褒贬取舍。对于能发扬新爱国主义精神，与革命的英雄主义，有助于反抗侵略、保卫和平、提倡人类正义、反抗压迫、争取民主自由的戏曲应予以特别表扬、推广。对旧有戏曲中的不良内容，各地文教主管机关，应与艺人合作进行修改，一般地应尽量消除其中毒素而保留其原剧目，不要轻易采取禁演、停演的办法。在审查旧戏曲时应注意迷信与神话的区别，因不少的神话都是古代人民对于自然现象之天真幻想，或对旧社会的抗议和对理想世界的追求。这种神话是对新社会不但无害而且有益的。只有写阴曹地狱循环报应来恐吓人民那才是有害的。其次是区别恋爱和淫乱。写男女相爱悦的戏，例加通过男女关系揭破封建压迫的“西厢记”等是不应当反对的，只有故意把这些戏演成淫亵下流，迎合观众低级趣味，才是应当反对的。因为那样客观上反而散播了封建毒素，模糊了观众对男女问题的健康的认识。舞台上许多侮辱与毒害劳动人民的，极端丑恶、猥亵、野蛮、恐怖的表演例如小脚、酷刑等，必须坚决地革除。这里有着剧本审查与演出形象审查的结合问题。
    各地文教机关对剧场上演节目应有严密注意，对于戏曲的不良内容虽不应过于性急，但也不应拖延不改。必须与艺人紧密合作，从剧本到演出都跟他们共同审查、修改。由于通过了戏曲界自己来决定，我们审定的“定本”必定更有权威，更便于演出。其确有重要毒害而难于修改的旧剧本应请示中央文化部作最后决定，不得任意处理。禁演旧剧目须报告中央文化部批准后方准实施。已放行的剧目不得任意留难。
  二、戏曲修改与创作问题
    我们对戏曲改革系以修改旧剧本及其演出形象竭力保存其原剧目为主，不采全部否定或放任自流的办法。因作为爱祖国、爱人民的新中国人必须爱我们祖宗传下来而被人民喜好的文化遗产。独创性极强的中国旧剧形式正是此种宝贵遗产之一。某些人把旧剧简单地当作封建时代为帝王、贵族、豪绅、地主服务的东西一概加以否定，而主张所谓“全般欧化”，这正是今天美帝所提倡的资产阶级世界主义所要求的，他们正是要夺去我们的民族自尊心、自信心，让我们从精神上向企图独霸世界的美帝屈服。应该知道封建时代不止有帝王、贵族、豪绅、地主，还有劳动人民。一切艺术如同一切其他文化一样，正是人民的智慧和劳动的积累，在封建统治下它自不免蒙受封建主义的影响，但仍可以从其中听到人民的伟大脉搏。列宁说过的：“每一时代的民族文化中都有民主主义、社会主义的成份，那怕这种成份是不发展的。因为每一时代，每一民族只要有劳动群众与被剥削群众存在，他们的生活条件必然产生民主主义的，社会主义的思想，至少是民主主义的社会主义的萌芽思想。”（见列宁“论艺术与文化”）因此我们民族文化遗产的聪明的继承者“必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的民间文化即多少带有民主性与革命性的东西区别开来”。而“剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华”。（见毛主席“新民主主义论”第十五节）这就是批判地接受遗产，也就是发扬民族新文化的必要条件。第一次文代大会时周总理回答关于旧文艺的问题时说得好：“旧文艺里的一切坏的部分，一切不适合于人民利益人民要求的部分一定就会消灭，比如宣传封建思想和其他反革命思想的东西，就应该加以消灭；另外有一些合理的、可以发展的东西就会慢慢地提高、进步，逐渐变成新文艺的组成部分。”如今我们处理旧戏曲遗产而以修改为主，不只是一时的“利用”，“利用”之后便予以弃置的问题，而是一个文化上继往开来的问题。我们要使旧形式迅速为人民服务，就在这一服务中使它慢慢地提高、进步。我们的修改系从内容逐渐及于形式。修改便是“批判”，也便是一种“创作”。不要把修改与创作完全对立地看，其实，好的修改也就是创作。把旧的火车头加以修改使它重新为人民服务的人既被尊为劳动英雄，把旧戏曲修改得完全符合人民需要，取得新的艺术生命，那不是创作是什么？当然，我们也要组织大量创作，特别是像评戏、楚剧、越剧、沪剧等那些新起的剧种，自不能不以新剧本为主要营养。
    我们修改旧剧的步骤，首先是进行最必要的消毒，即抛弃其有害于人民的腐朽的、落后的部分，如鼓吹奴才思想的，残酷、恐怖、野蛮、落后的部分，而保存和吸取其有利于人民的健康的、进步的部分，作为优秀传统继承下来，并在新民主主义的基础上加以发展，这样，旧的民族戏剧艺术就变成新的人民戏曲，成为新文艺的重要组成部分。
    中国旧剧形式一般认为较适宜于表现历史的故事。全部旧剧目以京剧为例，据十年前的不完全的统计最多的是三国戏，凡二十三种；其次东周列国的戏二十一种；水浒戏二十种；北宋杨家将十八种；三侠五义十三种；施公案十三种；征东十二种；五代残唐十一种；说岳十一种；飞龙传十种；红楼梦九种；东汉九种；封神榜九种；英烈传九种；彭公案八种；西汉七种；今古奇观六种；西游八种；聊斋五种。的确，旧剧把中国民族的历史通俗化了，但很大的部分把它歪曲了，颠倒了。这就是毛主席的说：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧舞台上人民却成了渣滓，由老爷、太太、少爷、小姐统治着舞台。”我们今天的任务便是要从过去封建统治阶级蒙蔽歪曲之下，恢复历史的本来面目，找到历史舞台上真正的主人。用历史唯物主义的观点反映历史真实、传达历史教训、表扬历史上英雄人物在当时历史条件下所具有的进步性、人民性、和高尚民族品质，以教育和鼓舞后代儿女。但不应生硬地将历史人物现代化，更不应将历史上自发的农民战争的事迹与现代人民革命斗争的事迹作不适当的对比。因为过去历史上不可能有无产阶级、共产党、毛主席。
    我们对于历史人物应当采取历史主义的看法。不管他是帝王将相，文武官员，文人学士……，只要他的行动在当时历史阶段，符合人民的最高利益，我们将同样予以表扬。我们祖先中有这样多对人民、民族有益的丰功伟绩、奇节至勇、潜德幽光，是足以增加我们民族的自信心、自尊心的。但这种表扬应恰如其分，不能将封建阶级“理想化”。我们说把历史还给历史，也不是为历史而历史。我们表现历史现实为的是教育、鼓舞后代儿女。历史剧与当前现实斗争之间，必有有机联系，譬如江河万古巨流不可截断，不能孤立。
    因而许多人习惯于称“现代剧”为“现实剧”以与“历史剧”相对，是不恰当的。好的历史剧和好的现代剧一样都表现的是现实内容。不好的现代剧尽管是时装，但可以是不现实的。
    民间传说一类的东西常有一种不易模仿而容易破坏的人类幼年时代的美，修改此类剧本也应注意，不要轻易加以破坏。
    处理历史题材之外，人民要求我们作家演员多处理反映当前现实的题材。以表现现代人民的斗争生活与伟大创造，刻划现代人民英雄人物的生动形象与精神气派。各地应经常组织与推动此类创作。
    再则新京剧，新地方戏一般都系长篇。各地小剧团，不易演出。影响不易普遍。应该多写短小精悍的富有战斗性的剧本，以便各地各种剧团班社随时都可以演出。
  三、戏改重点问题
    这里我们特别提到戏改重点问题。
    一九四八年十一月十三日“人民日报”上发表的“有计划有步骤地进行旧剧改革工作”专论中曾有这样的话：
    “……在修改对象上除了京剧以外应当特别着重地方戏的改革。各种地方戏的剧目是很多的，应当有计划有组织地加以搜集。这些戏许多是口头传授的，保留在民间艺人的脑子里，应当把它们记录下来，加以研究、审定与修改。这部分遗产的发掘，对于改革与建设中国民族的新歌剧将是极为珍贵的。”
    实在的，全国各地乡土艺术中还埋藏着中国民族丰富的生活象征和无限天才与智慧！对日抗战中，我们遍历东南、西南各地，每见同一剧本在各地演出，而方式风格、皆不相同。随着人民政权的普遍建立，我们不能再让这些文化宝藏埋没散佚，不加发扬。这是时候了！我们除了继续改革京剧外更应该把改革重点置于地方戏，有组织有计划地进行全国地方戏曲以及各少数民族萌芽状态的戏曲的普遍改革，争取全国各种戏曲艺术的“百花齐放”！
    这里必须指出：地方戏有两个范畴，一是地方大戏，像秦腔、徽调、汉剧、川剧、湘剧、滇剧、绍兴大班等，十行脚色比较完全，着重老生、青衣、丑、净等，一般搬演历史故事，大抵继承昆弋的传统，成为京剧的前身。一是民间小戏，如今日流行的评戏（蹦蹦）、越剧（的笃班）、沪剧（申滩）、楚剧（湖北花鼓戏，湖南花鼓戏也称楚剧）、云南花灯戏等，脚色主要是小生、小旦、小丑，所谓“三小”，曲调简单，一般只演家庭故事，社会杂相，尤其是男女情爱等。以前被士大夫称为“花鼓淫戏”多在夜间山野里演出。在北方如评戏、江南如越剧、沪剧、华中如楚剧等，近年皆突飞猛进，成为大戏。地方大戏如汉剧、川剧等，剧本与京剧大部分相同，程式化的演出法也相同。但究因散在各地，宫庭化的程度不深，又与乡土艺术结合，还保存较多人民的因素。如地方戏以小丑扮皇帝，时常把封建统治者的荒淫无耻，讽刺得淋漓尽致，在京剧却不多见。“八大拿”这一类镇压民间叛乱的戏，地方戏里也没有。又如湘戏“闹江”、“杀惜”等戏多能表现地方人民的强硬性格，川剧“秋江”写川江的滩和水，以及舟子们的劳动生活，都极为真切。又如地方戏对人物故事的更合理的处置，如秦腔“庆顶珠”对萧恩、玉枝（桂英），川戏“倒探”对杨四郎。再如同一“哑子背疯”，滇戏与川湘戏皆各有其特色。因而深入发掘地方戏及民间戏里更丰富的人民的成分，和比较生动素朴的表现形式对于发展戏剧教育、推进剧艺改革是十分必要的。
    这里也必须指出，戏曲艺术是不断发展的，民间小戏在发展过程中它必然向大戏学习，尽量吸取其长处以壮大自己。壮大以后，原来只演恋爱故事、社会杂相的，后来也演起大本历史戏来了。
    中国各种不同的地方歌舞剧的发展有其大体相同的径路，而且相互影响，这就决定了中国民族戏曲的共同的特色。不注意中国戏曲的发展径路及其相互影响，而把京剧和地方戏完全对立地看，也是不恰当的。
    广大地方戏发展不平衡，有的还不免十分原始粗糙，有待于国家有计划地统一地促进其丰富、提高。
    我们现在决定这样做：（１）各地戏改工作以对于当地群众影响最大的剧种为主要改革对象。（２）各地文教机关，戏曲改进机构，应多请当地戏曲界耆宿及重要演员参加，共同领导改进工作。并在可能条件下筹设地方戏曲学校，以培养后一代演员和戏改干部。（３）广泛搜集记录并刊行地方戏民间戏剧本，以供研究改进。（４）每年举行全国戏曲竞赛公演，展览地方戏及各民族剧改进成绩，奖励其优秀作品与演出，指导其发展方向。
  四、艺人团结学习问题
    全国广大的职业艺人是有广大群众基础的文艺工作者，也是劳动人民的一部分。如像古希腊的艺人多系奴隶出身一样，在旧中国也只有穷孩子才去学习戏曲。虽则他们实际是民族戏曲文化的担当者，但因艺人们既多是“幼而失学”，戏曲事业又被封建统治者视为“小道”，“贱业”，任何名艺人的一生都是受侮辱、受损害的一生。如今随着人民的解放，新中国的建立，艺人们翻身了，地位提高了，昨天的“高台教化”，今天成为“以艺术教育人民的教师”，对于这些人民的教师们，应当如何尊重他们！尊师所以重道，国家既将通过艺人们生动活泼的艺术，去提高广大人民政治觉悟，鼓舞其劳动与战斗热情，怎么能不尊重他们呢？他们的艺术是人民喜闻乐见的，人民热爱他们，需要他们。我们若不尊重他们，甚或重复旧社会对艺人的态度，那便是不尊重人民。古人说：“民之所好，好之”，不尊重艺人，团结艺人，便是反人民之所好，便是脱离人民。另一方面，就艺人们说，地位是提高了，责任便也加重了。以前的那一点本领不能应付今天的新局面。全国土改以后社会基础变了，观众、听众的质也变了，思想、趣味和以前不同了。他们以一种高尚、严肃的精神来到剧场，来到茶社，他们对表演者和他们的材料有了进一步的要求。你的艺术不能满足他们，或是你的艺术内容有了偏差，他们会向你提意见。因而担当这个“人民教师”的责任便不是太容易的了。怎么办呢？用毛主席的话，“只有做群众的学生，才能做群众的先生。”因而加紧学习必要的文化、学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，提高业务到有益于人民的程度是十分必要的了。
    早在一九四四年毛主席便教我们组成“新形式与旧形式的统一战线”，并教我们把统一战线的两大原则：团结与批评、或教育改造，运用在这一方面。他说：“投降旧形式是错误的，排挤鄙弃也是错误的。我们的任务是联合一切可用的旧形式、旧艺人而帮助感化与改造他们。为了改造他们，就须先要团结他们”。（见毛主席“关于文化运动方针的指示”）在第一次全国文代大会时，周总理更引申毛主席的话而有这样的指示：“旧社会对于旧文艺的态度是又爱好，又侮辱。他们爱好旧内容旧形式的艺术，但是他们又瞧不起旧艺人，总是侮辱他们。现在是新社会、新时代了，我们应当尊重一切受群众爱好的旧艺人，尊重他们方能改造他们。”
    尊重便是团结问题，统一战线问题。改造便是批评，教育问题。这不是降低我们艺人，恰恰是提高我们艺人。一年来，全国各重要城市，以讲习班、文化识字班、艺人学校、戏曲座谈会、竞赛公演等方式进行了艺人的教育。这样的教育要继续不断地办，坚苦卓绝地办。我们应当通过团结、教育、增加广大艺人对国家的感情，唤起他们爱国心和对新社会的责任心，使他们感到他们个人的前途与人民共和国的前途是如此紧密联系着：国家前途光明，他们前途便也光明，因而更紧密地把他们的艺术和当前现实结合，为祖国胜利建国与世界持久和平服务！
    艺人的教育改造对于艺人政治觉悟的提高，生活作风的改变，宿命思想的消减，团结友爱精神的唤起，自动编改剧本能力的培养，新的演剧制度的建立等已经有了初步收获。但无可讳言的还存在一些缺点，如对教育布置计划和教学方法还不完全适合艺人需要。今后应该加以改进，务使巨大艺人部队都成为毛主席的好学生，和革命的戏曲战士！各地艺人自经学习，有的已成为光荣的共产党员和新民主主义青年团员；（如东北艺人中党、团员达二百○五人。其他北京、天津、武汉、上海、济南各地都有许多艺人入团入党。）有的成为戏改干部；有的参加人民解放军，上海有艺人三名参加援朝志愿军；有的参加土改。这都说明戏曲工作者已朝着毛主席所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向迈进。也只有坚持这个正确方向，戏改工作才会获得决定性的成就，才会使中国戏曲脱胎换骨、成为真正人民需要的艺术。
    保证戏改事业的有效完成必须展开毛主席指示的“新形式与旧形式的统一战线”。也就是新文学戏剧工作者与艺人们进一步的团结合作。旧戏曲改革与新歌剧创造不必完全看成一事，但至少是互相紧密关联的。新歌剧的创造既必须与人民歌剧传统相结合，相衔接，如现行新歌剧多从旧秧歌剧蜕变而来，也就是一种旧形式改造与发展过程。旧戏曲改革事业的成败直接影响“人民新戏曲”时代的是否早日到来。我们应当唤起广大新文艺工作者对戏改事业的应有重视和加深了解。两者的互相学习，合作，会保证戏改主要具体问题：如剧本修改与创作问题，戏剧音乐与舞台艺术改进问题等的顺利解决。由于这样的合作会渐次消除“新”与“旧”之间的界线与隔膜。各地戏改机构正是要负责经常策动此种团结合作。我们提议以后废止“旧艺人”这样的称呼，而只称“艺人”“戏曲工作者”，因为旧艺人一经改造，接受了新人生观，以其艺术为人民服务，他便成为“新艺人”了。正如内容与形式都经过改造的旧戏曲已属于“新文艺”的范畴一样。
    在毛主席文艺思想的指导与人民政府文教主管机关的统一领导之下，依靠新旧文艺工作者的通力合作与广大艺人的自觉，中国旧有戏曲的改革与中国新歌舞剧的创造的巨大历史任务必将顺利地完成。
