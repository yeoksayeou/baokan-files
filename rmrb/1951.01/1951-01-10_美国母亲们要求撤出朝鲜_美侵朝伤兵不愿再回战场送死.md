Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 8th: American mothers are taking action to demand the withdrawal of American invading forces from Korea and a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.

The London Daily Worker's special correspondent reported from New York: Mrs. Ernest Miller, whose son was surrounded in Korea, placed a two-line "personals" advertisement in the Pittsburgh News: "Families with loved ones surrounded in Korea, please call 1-9698."

This advertisement received a stormy response from mothers who also had sons fighting in Korea. In three days, more than 300 people called Mrs. Miller. Later, she and the mothers who contacted her sent telegrams to the congressmen in their districts, demanding the withdrawal of American soldiers from Korea.

Mrs. Miller predicted that this movement would spread throughout the country. She said that in Michigan, Florida, New York, and Maryland, this request has already been made, and mothers in Pennsylvania and other states will also publish advertisements similar to hers.

Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: According to a United Press report, wounded American soldiers in the Korean War are unwilling to return to the battlefield to die. An American soldier named Taylor, who was lying in a military hospital after being wounded three times, told a United Press reporter: "I want to go home. I'm not crazy, and of course I won't have the idea of going back to Korea to be wounded a fourth time." This soldier said this when he learned that his mother was asking to have him sent back to the United States. He approved of his mother's actions. When asked if he was the only American soldier in Korea who had been wounded three times, as U.S. Department of Defense officials had said, the soldier immediately denied it, saying, "There are quite a few American soldiers who have been wounded three times." Then he familiarly named some of his comrades.

　　美国母亲们要求撤出朝鲜
    美侵朝伤兵不愿再回战场送死
    【本报讯】据新华社布拉格八日电：美国的母亲们正在以行动要求把美国侵略军撤出朝鲜，和平解决朝鲜问题。
    伦敦工人日报特派记者自纽约报道：儿子在朝鲜被围的厄奈斯特·密勒夫人，曾在匹兹堡新闻报上登了两行“寻人”广告：“有亲人在朝鲜被围的家庭请打电话给一·九六九八”。
    这个广告从也有儿子在朝鲜作战的母亲们那里得到暴风雨般的回答。在三天中有三百多人打电话给密勒夫人。后来她和与她取得联络的母亲们纷纷致电她们选区的议员，要求把美国士兵们从朝鲜撤回。
    密勒夫人预言：这个运动将扩展到全国各地。她说：在密执安、佛罗里达、纽约和马利兰各州，这个要求已被提出，宾夕法尼亚州以及其他的州的母亲们，也将刊登和她相类似的广告。
    【新华社七日讯】据合众社消息透露：侵朝美军的伤兵不愿重回战场去送死。因受伤三次，而躺在兵站医院里的美国士兵泰勒告诉合众社记者说：“我喜欢回家。我并没有发疯，当然不会有再回到朝鲜去受第四次伤的念头的。”这个士兵是在知道他的母亲正在要求将他送回美国时这样说的。他赞成他母亲的做法。当问他是否像美国国防部官员所说他是在朝鲜的唯一受了三次伤的美国兵时，这个兵士马上否认，他说：“有好些美国兵受了三次伤。”接着他就熟悉地举出了他的一些同伴们的姓名。
