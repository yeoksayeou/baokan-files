　　Several Questions Regarding Disciplinary Actions for Individual Party Members – Answers to Readers' Questions
            (Question) To the Editors:
    We have several questions regarding disciplinary actions for individual Party members. We would appreciate it if you could answer them:
    First, what standard should be used to determine the disciplinary action for a Party member who violates discipline?
    Second, which is more serious, a private admonition or a public warning?
    Third, some branches use "suspension of Party membership," "demotion to probationary Party member," "extension of the probationary period," and "criticism" as internal "disciplinary actions." Are these in accordance with the Party Constitution?
    Fourth, can Party disciplinary actions be rescinded?

                                          Andong Senior Vocational School, Yu Nan
            (Answer)
    According to the interpretation of the Party Constitution: The Party should resolutely impose disciplinary actions on Party members who fail to implement Party resolutions or violate the Party Constitution and Party discipline. The positive purpose of such disciplinary actions is to educate all Party members and the masses and to educate the punished person. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels should be particularly cautious when disciplining a Party member. A detailed investigation and study must be conducted on the mistakes committed by the Party member, and then the appropriate disciplinary action should be given based on the nature, severity, and impact of the mistake. On the other hand, Party organizations must strictly follow the procedures stipulated in the Party for disciplining Party members when deciding to discipline any Party member; and should, as far as possible, allow the punished person to attend the meeting in person to defend themselves. After the disciplinary action is taken, the reasons for the disciplinary action should be formally notified to the punished person. If the punished person disagrees with the disciplinary action, they have the right to request the Party organization to reconsider it; or to appeal to a higher-level organization; Party organizations at all levels must not suppress this; and must assist them in their appeal.
    According to the Party Constitution, there are five types of disciplinary actions the Party can take against Party members: admonition, warning, removal from Party work, probation within the Party, and expulsion from the Party.
    Admonition and warning disciplinary actions are divided into private and public. If arranged in order of severity, it should be: private admonition, public admonition, private warning, public warning. The Party Constitution writes "private admonition or warning; public admonition or warning" for the convenience of wording, not in order of severity.
    "Removal from Party work" disciplinary action refers to the removal of the Party member who committed the error from the work they are undertaking within the Party. This type of disciplinary action cannot be taken against those who do not hold a position within the Party. After removal from Party work, their organizational life and political treatment are the same as those of a full Party member. However, organizations at all levels should not confuse this type of disciplinary action with administrative dismissal. If it is necessary to impose administrative dismissal, a suggestion should be made to the administration, and the administration should decide to implement it.
    "Probation within the Party" disciplinary action is applicable to full Party members who have committed serious errors but have not reached the point of expulsion from the Party and still need to continue to be educated and observed within the Party. During the probation period, their Party organizational life and political treatment should generally be the same as those of probationary Party members. The probation period is generally not less than six months and does not exceed two years. After the probation period expires, if they have indeed corrected their mistakes, this disciplinary action can be terminated; and their organizational life and political treatment as a full Party member can be restored. The probation period is still counted within their Party membership length. If a probationary Party member commits a serious error equivalent to that requiring a full Party member to be placed on probation within the Party, it indicates that they have lost the qualifications to be a probationary Party member and should be expelled from the Party.
    "Expulsion from the Party" disciplinary action is the highest disciplinary action within the Party. Expulsion from the Party should be the final means of disciplining Party members, and no other means should be used. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels should be very cautious when using this disciplinary action.
    The Party's disciplinary actions against Party members should be different from administrative disciplinary actions, and the two should not be confused. Party disciplinary actions and administrative disciplinary actions should be determined according to the nature of the error. If the error is of an administrative nature, an administrative disciplinary action can be suggested, and the Party does not need to impose another disciplinary action. However, many errors violate both government laws and Party discipline. In this case, the Party should reach a consensus with the administration and determine the disciplinary action based on the severity of the error and the scope of its impact. If there is a disagreement between the Party and the administration, they can report separately and ask the higher authorities to decide.
    After the Party decides on a disciplinary action against a Party member, if the error is not of a general nature, does not involve many people, and its content does not pertain to policy, the method of announcing it privately can be adopted. If the error is of a general nature and concerns the broad masses, and has educational significance for everyone, it should be announced publicly. The methods of public announcement are: announcing it at a certain meeting; or a Party internal notice; or publishing it in Party newspapers and periodicals; or even adopting these methods simultaneously.
    Regarding the issue of rescinding disciplinary actions against Party members, Comrade Shaoqi mentioned in his On the Party: "After the Party member has, in fact, corrected the error, the disciplinary action should be rescinded." This means that if the Party member originally made a mistake in this work or on this issue, and later indeed corrected the mistake—in terms of work, has made significant achievements; in terms of thought, has made significant progress—the disciplinary action can be rescinded. Comrade Shaoqi also said: "Or if the disciplinary action is wrong, or the disciplinary action does not match the facts, it should be rescinded after being proven."
    In addition to the above five types, there are no other disciplinary actions within the Party for Party members. Using "suspension of Party membership" and "demotion to probationary Party member" as disciplinary actions is not in accordance with the Party Constitution. As for "criticism" and "extension of the probationary period," neither belongs to the nature of disciplinary actions. Criticism of Party members should be considered as one of the ways to educate Party members. "Extension of the probationary period" is given because the probationary Party member has not made rapid progress during the probationary period or certain issues still need to be investigated.

　　关于党员个人处分的几个问题  答读者问
            （问题）编辑同志：
    有几个关于党员个人处分的问题，请你们解答：
    第一，对违犯纪律的党员，应以什么标准来确定处分？
    第二，当众劝告与当面警告，那个重，那个轻？
    第三，有些支部采用“停止党籍”、“降为候补党员”、“延长候补期”、“批评”等作为党内的“处分”，这是否合乎党章规定？
    第四，党内处分是否可以取消？
                                          中共苏北区党委宣传部
                                          济北疗养院  李西田
                                          安东高职教导处  于南
            （解答）
    按照党章解释：党对不执行党的决议，违犯党章、党纪的党员，是应坚决给予处分的。这种处分的积极目的，就是教育全体党员与人民群众并教育受处分者本人。因此各级党的组织在处分一个党员时，应特别审慎。对党员所犯错误必须进行详细的调查研究，然后根据错误的性质、轻重、影响给以应有的处分。另一方面，党的组织在决定处分任何党员时，要严格执行党处分党员的规定手续；并应尽可能使被处分者亲自到会，进行辩护。在处分后，应将处分的理由正式通知被处分者。被处分者对处分不服时，有权要求党的组织进行复议；或向上级机关申诉；各级党的组织不得抑制；并须帮助其上诉。
    按照党章规定，党对党员的处分，共有五种：即劝告、警告、撤消工作、留党察看、开除党籍。
    劝告与警告处分，有当面与当众之分。如果按轻重次序来排列，应该是：当面劝告、当众劝告、当面警告、当众警告。党章上写成“当面的劝告或警告；当众的劝告或警告”，这是为了行文上的方便，并不是按轻重的次序排列的。
    “撤消工作”处分，是指撤消犯错误党员在党内所担负的工作而言。未在党内担任工作者，就不能进行此种处分。撤消工作后，其组织生活与政治待遇与正式党员相同。但各级组织在采用这种处分时，不可与行政上的撤职处分混淆起来。如果需要在行政上给予撤职处分时，就应向行政建议，由行政上决定执行。
    “留党察看”处分，适用于虽犯有严重错误，但尚不到开除党籍的程度，仍需要在党内继续进行教育察看之正式党员。在察看期间，其党的组织生活与政治待遇一般应与候补党员相同。留党察看的时间，一般的不少于半年，不超过二年。察看期满后，对其所犯错误确实有所改正，即可停止这一处分；并恢复其正式党员的组织生活与政治待遇。其察看期间，仍算在党龄之内。凡候补党员犯有相当于正式党员须受留党察看处分之严重错误者，已说明其失去作为一个候补党员的条件，应开除其候补党员的党籍。
    “开除党籍”处分，是党内最高的处分。在党内对党员的处分，只能以开除党籍为最后手段，除此以外，不得再采用其他手段。因此各级党组织，在采用这种处分时，应十分慎重。
    党对党员执行纪律处分时，应与行政处分有所区别，两者不能混淆。党内处分与行政处分须依其错误性质而定。如错误属于行政方面者，可建议行政上处分，党内就不必再给处分。但有不少错误，既违犯政府法令，同时也违犯党纪。这样党应与行政取得一致意见，就其错误之严重程度与影响范围而分别确定其处分。如遇到党与行政意见分歧时，还可以分别上报，请示上级决定。
    党对党员的处分决定之后，凡其错误不带一般性，不涉及很多人，其内容又不属于政策方面者，可采取当面宣布的办法。若错误带有一般性与广大群众有关，有教育大家意义的，则应该当众宣布。其当众宣布方式：在一定的会议上宣布；或党内通报；或在党的报纸和刊物上公布；甚至把这几种方式同时采用。
    关于取消党员的处分问题，少奇同志曾在论党中谈到：“在该党员从事实上改正错误之后，即取消处分。”这就是说这一党员本来在这个工作或这一问题上犯有错误，以后确实改正了错误——以工作论，有了显著的工作成绩；以思想说，有了显著进步，就可取消处分。少奇同志又说：“或者处分错误，处分与事实不符，经证明后，即应取消。”
    党内对党员处分，除以上五种外，没有其他处分。将“停止党籍”、“降为候补党员”等做为处分，是不符合党章规定的。至于“批评”与“延长候补期”，均不属于处分性质。对党员的批评，应该认为是对党员教育方式之一。“延长候补期”是因为候补党员在候补期中，进步不快或某些问题尚须考察，才给予延长。
