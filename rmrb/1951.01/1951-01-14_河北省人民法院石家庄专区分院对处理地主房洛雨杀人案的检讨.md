Reaction to Criticism from the People's Daily

To the Editors:
　　The People's Daily published a letter on October 14th, "Landlord Counterattacks and Murders Revolutionary Cadres; Village Cadres Aid and Abet, Special County Handles Matter Carelessly," which criticized our court. We are now sending you our self-criticism.
　　Regarding the case of landlord Fang Luoyu and his son, Black Dog, from Xihe Village, Third District, Zhengding, who beat village chief Kang Yuhuan to death on the night of July 6, 1949, after the Zhengding County Judicial Section's judgment on October 24, 1949, the deceased's son, Kang Zhenjiang, appealed to the Hebei Provincial People's Court. On November 12th of the same year, the Hebei Provincial People's Court transferred the case to our branch for handling. In January 1950, our branch summoned Kang Zhenjiang and the criminal Fang Luoyu to court for questioning. When we accepted this case, we lacked sufficient understanding. In handling the case, we did not go to the scene of the incident to conduct detailed investigations and research to understand the overall factual materials, but only relied on the petition, the county judicial section's judgment, and the statements of both parties. Therefore, we believed that Kang Yuhuan was indeed run over by a bullock cart, and Fang Luoyu should only be held responsible for injuring the person, not for beating the person to death. We failed to recognize the criminal Fang's historical bullying behavior and that this act of violence was actually premeditated murder, and we also failed to understand that no one in the village dared to be the village chief after Kang Yuhuan's death. Thus, we handled the case carelessly. After examination, we found that our position was unclear and our views were vague when handling this case.

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　河北省人民法院石家庄专区分院对处理地主房洛雨杀人案的检讨编辑同志：
    十月十四日人民日报发表了“地主反攻杀害革命干部，村干帮凶、专县马虎了事”的来信，对我院提出批评。现将我院检讨寄给你们。
    正定三区西河村地主房洛雨及其子黑狗等在一九四九年七月六日黑夜打死村长康玉环案，一九四九年十月二十四日经正定县司法科判决后，死者之子康振江向河北省人民法院上诉，同年十一月十二日河北省人民法院将该案转本分院办理。一九五○年一月份，本分院传讯康振江及房犯洛雨到庭询问。我院在接受此案时即认识不足，而在处理该案时，并未深入到肇事地点作详细的调查研究，了解全面的实际材料，而只以呈状、县司法科判决书及双方供词为根据。因此，认为康玉环确系被牛车轧死，房洛雨仅应负打伤人之责，不应负打死人之责；而未认识到房犯在历史上之恶霸行为以及此次行凶实际是预谋杀人，更未了解到自康玉环死后，该村就无人敢当村长了。这样，就把该案马马虎虎地处理了。经过检查，我们发现在处理这个案件时，我们的立场是不明确的，观点是模糊的。
