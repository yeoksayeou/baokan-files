　　*Democratic Youth* Magazine's Propaganda Work on the Korean War Resistance Against America
　　Li Ben Zhao
　　In the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country, the propaganda and mobilization of youth publications is a very important task. *Democratic Youth*, the organ publication of the Communist Youth League of the Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee, has done a relatively good job in this regard.

　　Contacting the masses and connecting with reality are the greatest advantages of this publication. Kalinin said that the Bolsheviks' contact with the masses is to "guide the masses and follow the conscious vanguard forward." Obviously, only by correctly contacting the masses can we achieve the goal of correctly guiding the masses forward. *Democratic Youth*, in this respect, is doing what Kalinin said.

　　One of the main characteristics of the publication is its ability to grasp the ideological situation of the young masses and provide guidance. For example, the article "Strengthen Current Affairs Study and Enhance National Self-Confidence" in issue 112 reviewed the indifference to current affairs among some young people in Lushun-Dalian, and pointed out that the purpose of studying current affairs is to "enable us to maintain a clear mind in the development of victory, consciously and actively participate in various production, construction and work, and strive for success and victory in the aspects that are beneficial to the people." We must be vigilant against the imperialist conspiracy of aggression, and therefore "must establish a strong national defense army, must establish a strong economic force," "in order to defend the already obtained fruits of victory, in order to defend the peaceful construction that is underway." At the same time, it also reviewed the idea of losing national self-confidence by "overestimating the enemy and underestimating ourselves," and pointed out that "imperialism is very fragile, its strength is not terrible, it can be defeated," "we Chinese people are hardworking and brave." "Our victory has caused extreme panic among world imperialism. At the same time, our victory is also encouraging the people of Asia to unite and resolutely resist imperialism. Mao Zedong Thought is illuminating the path of struggle for the people of all ethnic groups in the East." Also, issue 114, "Is This the 'Science' and 'Civilization' of America?", issue 115, "How to Despise the Enemy", issue 116, "A Brief Discussion on Several Questions Related to the Current Situation", etc., are all based on the understanding of the Propaganda Department of the Lushun-Dalian Committee of the Communist Youth League and the letters received from readers by the publication, specifically grasping the ideological situation of the young people, analyzing some vague concepts theoretically, and listing facts to illustrate them, so that the young people feel that it is solving their own ideological problems, making the young people interested in reading these theoretical articles.

　　Proactively going deep into the young masses is another characteristic of the publication. They often participate in the League's meetings in factories and schools, or production group meetings in factories. For example, the article "Two <This Way> and My Opinion" in issue 113 is the criticism and suggestions made by the reporter of *Democratic Youth* after participating in the Lushun-Dalian Shipyard League Committee and the Railway League Committee on the work of these two aspects. In issue 114, the publication once again called on young people to love the motherland and to "learn from the patriotism of Soviet youth," and also organized a forum for readers of *Democratic Youth* to discuss "How Should We Love the Motherland," and immediately recorded the situation of this forum in issue 115. In this way, not only can the publication's call to love the motherland be implemented through the organized readers' reaction, but it also strengthens the connection between the publication and the readers, making the readers deeply feel that this magazine is indeed their own garden, thus greatly increasing the interest of the broad masses in reading the magazine. At the same time, in this magazine, in addition to the "Youth Garden" column, many articles are contributed by the members of the Communist Youth League and young people in various factories and schools, and are flexibly organized and published by the editors, which correctly reflects the progressive will of the young masses.

　　Concrete help for the propaganda and mobilization work of the Communist Youth League is also a feature of the publication. For example, starting from issue 112, it continuously uses the dialogue between a young man and a propagandist to vividly and popularly write about why "American imperialism is a dying tiger," "American imperialism is our most hateful enemy," "American imperialism is digging its own grave," and so on. For example, in issue 111, the publication, on the one hand, wrote an article calling on young people to "love the motherland and protect the motherland," and on the other hand, published the article "Our Motherland is So Lovable," using concrete facts to illustrate the lovableness of our motherland. Such propaganda is extremely beneficial to correctly cultivating the young people's passionate love for the motherland.

　　The publication can also timely correct the deviations in propaganda and education work. For example, issue 115 reviewed the deviations in the youth's current affairs study, calling for "deepening the current affairs study by one step," and issue 117 emphasized the need to "strengthen the Communist Youth League's current affairs and political education." For example, in order to do a good job in propaganda work, the publication also called for "establishing part-time propagandists" (issue 116), and in issue 118, it immediately pointed out the shortcomings in this work, pointing out that it is necessary to pay attention to the quality of propagandists, carefully promote it, and "do a good job in key pilot projects," which is the "important key to building a good part-time propagandist."

　　Another characteristic of the publication is its attention to the exchange of work experience. For example, in issue 111, while calling for "loving the motherland and protecting the motherland," it introduced Comrade Liu Enhua's experience in conducting patriotic education for young people. While calling for studying current affairs, it continuously published articles such as "How the Glass Factory Conducts Current Affairs Education," "The Anti-American Propaganda Work of Guanghe Machinery Factory," "How the Dalian Machinery League Branch Conducts Political Current Affairs Education," etc. When calling for the establishment of part-time propagandists in issue 116, it introduced the propaganda and mobilization work of model advanced worker Zhao Guoyou. When calling for "deepening the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, and raising the production competition movement by one step," it introduced the Liu Lifu production team, which completed more than 200 percent of the task, and other good production experiences. It also sharply told the workers: "Make production achievements and strike at American robbers," so that, as Kalinin said: when our workers are working, "they can understand that what he is doing is also a major national event, working for national defense."

　　Flexible editing techniques are also a noteworthy advantage. For example, after the articles "American Imperialism is a Dying Tiger", "American Imperialism is Our Most Hateful Enemy", "American Imperialism is Digging its Own Grave", it is matched with many comic strips, such as "It (referring to American imperialism) has always been a robber", "Remember These Historical Facts", "Digging its Own Grave", etc. For example, when issue 114 reprinted *China Youth*'s editorial "Resolutely Struggle Against Counter-Revolutionary Elements", it was matched with a short essay on the story of "No Tolerance for the Enemy" that once happened between Lenin and Gorky. This combination can not only increase the young people's interest in reading relatively rigid articles, but also help to deeply understand the problem.

　　However, this publication is not without shortcomings, such as some texts are not concise and popular enough, and some pictures are printed vaguely, which need to be improved. Many of the advantages of this publication can also be seen in some other magazines, but the success of this publication in contacting the masses and connecting with reality is obviously worth learning from by many magazines.

　　《民主青年》杂志的抗美援朝宣传工作
    李本昭
    在抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，青年刊物的宣传鼓动是一个很重要的工作。青年团旅大市委会的机关刊物《民主青年》，在这方面是做得比较好的。
    联系群众和联系实际是该刊的最大优点，加里宁说过：布尔塞维克的联系群众是“引导群众，跟着觉悟的先锋队前进。”显然，只有正确地联系群众，才能达到正确地引导群众前进的目的。《民主青年》在这一方面，就是照着加里宁所说的这样做的。
    该刊的主要特点之一，是能掌握青年群众的思想情况加以指导。例如一一二期上的《加强时事学习，提高民族自信心》一文，检讨了旅大部分青年群众中存在的对时事漠不关心的思想，指出研究时事的目的是为了“使我们在胜利的发展中，保持清醒的头脑，自觉地积极地参加各种生产建设和工作，争取于人民有利的这一方面的成功与胜利”，我们必须警惕帝国主义的侵略阴谋，因而“必须建立强大的国防军，必须建立强大的经济力量”，“才能保卫已经获得的胜利果实，才能保卫正在进行的和平建设”。同时也检讨了“过高估计敌人，过低估计自己”的丧失民族自信心的思想，指出“帝国主义是非常脆弱的，它的力量并没有什么可怕，它是可以打败的”，“我们中国人民是劳动的，又是勇敢的”。“我们的胜利已引起世界帝国主义极度的惊惶。同时，我们的胜利，也正在鼓舞亚洲人民团结起来，向帝国主义进行坚决的反抗。毛泽东思想，正照耀着东方各民族人民斗争的道路”。又如一一四期“这就是美国的‘科学’与‘文明’吗？”，一一五期“怎样蔑视敌人”，一一六期“漫谈有关时局的几点疑问”等，都是根据青年团旅大区委宣传部的了解和该刊收到的读者来信，具体掌握了青年们的思想情况，针对一些模糊观念，予以理论上的分析，并列举事实加以说明，这样就使得青年们觉得它是在解决自己的思想问题，使青年有兴趣去读这些理论文章。
    主动地深入到青年群众中去，是该刊的又一特点。他们经常参加工厂、学校里的团的会议，或工厂中的生产小组会议。例如一一三期上的《两个〈这样〉和我的意见》一文，就是民主青年社的记者参加了青年团旅大船渠团委员会与青年团铁路团委员会后，对这两方面工作所提出的批评和建议。在一一四期上，该刊再度号召青年要爱祖国，要“学习苏联青年的爱国主义精神”，同时又组织了一次民主青年社读者座谈会，讨论“我们应当怎样爱祖国”，并且立即在一一五期上把这个座谈会情形记录出来。这样，不但使该刊关于爱祖国的号召，能够通过有组织的读者的反应贯彻起来，而且也加强了该刊与读者的联系，使读者们深深感到这个杂志确是他们自己的园地，因而就能大大提高广大群众阅读杂志的兴趣。同时，在这个杂志中，除了《青年园地》一栏外，有很多稿子都是各工厂、学校的青年团员和青年们的投稿，而由编者灵活地加以组织起来发表的，这样就正确地反映了在青年群众中的前进的意志。
    对青年团的宣传鼓动工作的具体的帮助，也是该刊的一个特点。如从一一二期起，连续用一个青年和一个宣传员的对答方式生动而通俗地写出为什么“美帝国主义是一只快死的老虎”，“美帝国主义是我们最可恨的仇人”，“美帝国主义在自己找死”等等问题。又如在一一一期上，该刊一方面著论号召青年们应该“热爱祖国，保护祖国”，一方面又发表了《我们的祖国是这样可爱》的文章，用具体的事实来说明我们祖国的可爱。这样的宣传对于正确地培养青年们热烈爱慕祖国的感情，是极有益处的。
    该刊又能及时的纠正宣传教育工作中的偏差。比如一一五期检讨了青年时事学习中的偏差，号召“把时事学习深入一步”，一一七期又着重提出要“加强青年团的时事政治教育”。又如为了作好宣传工作，该刊又号召“建立兼职宣传员”（一一六期），在一一八期上，又立即就这一工作进行中的缺点，指出必须重视宣传员的质量问题，慎重推行，“作好重点试建”，才是“建好兼职宣传员的重要关键”。
    该刊又一特点是注意工作经验的交流。如在一一一期上号召“热爱祖国，保护祖国”的同时，介绍了刘恩华同志对青年进行爱国主义教育的经验。在号召学习时事时，连续发表了《玻璃工厂怎样进行时事教育》，《广和机械厂的反美宣传工作》，《大连机械团支部怎样进行政治时事教育》等文。在一一六期号召建立兼职宣传员时，介绍了模范先进工人赵国有的宣传鼓动工作。在号召“把抗美援朝运动深入一步，把生产竞赛运动提高一步”时，介绍了完成任务百分之二百以上的刘立富生产小组和其他好的生产经验。它又尖锐地告诉工人们：“作出生产成绩，打击美国强盗”，这样，就如加里宁所说：我们工人在工作时，“便能够理解到他所做的同时也是一件国家大事，是为了国防而工作。”
    编辑技术灵活也是应当指出的一个优点。如在《美帝国主义是一只快死的老虎》，《美帝国主义是我们最可恨的仇人》，《美帝国主义在自己找死》等文之后，配合着许多连环漫画，如《它（指美帝）从来就是强盗》，《记住这些历史事实》，《自掘坟墓》等。又如一一四期转载《中国青年》的一篇社论《坚决与反革命分子作斗争》时，配合发表了一段曾经发生在列宁与高尔基之间的《对敌人不能宽容》的故事的小品文。这种配合不但能增加青年阅读比较硬性的文章的兴趣，而且能帮助深入理解问题。
    但是这个刊物也不是没有缺点的，如有些文字还不够简洁和通俗，有一些画图印刷得模糊不清，都是需要改进的。该刊的许多优点，在有些别的杂志中也是看得出来的，但这个刊物在联系群众、联系实际上的成功，显然还是值得许多杂志学习的。
