　　Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    Achievements in Last Year's Work
    National Membership Reaches 3,310,000
    [This newspaper reports] The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Headquarters achieved great success in 1950 in enhancing the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, introducing advanced Soviet science, culture, and art, improving the people's understanding of the Soviet Union, and strengthening internationalist propaganda.

    The achievements of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association are primarily reflected in the rapid development of its organization. Currently, there are Friendship Association organizations established in two large administrative regions, twenty-four provinces, six administrative areas, thirteen large cities, and sixty-five cities under the jurisdiction of provinces and administrative areas throughout the country. The national membership has grown from 700,000 from October 1949 to 3,313,799 by November 1950. The development of membership in various regions has gradually expanded from urban areas to the vast countryside, and attention has begun to be paid to recruiting female members. For example, in Hubei Province, farmers account for more than half of the members; in Hubei, Tianjin, and other ten provinces and cities, female members account for an average of more than 15 percent.

    In order to systematically and widely introduce the advanced Soviet science, culture, and economic construction experience, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Headquarters actively carried out the translation and publication of related books and periodicals, photo exhibitions, film screenings, and other propaganda service work, invited Soviet scholars to come to China to give lectures, and widely launched Russian language learning work in the capital and various regions, making it convenient for cadres and staff to learn from the advanced Soviet experience. All of the above work has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

    In terms of international liaison, over the past year, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Headquarters has established closer ties with the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and has successively established contacts and exchanged publications with the people's friendship associations with the Soviet Union in fifteen countries, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Korea, Bulgaria, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Canada, Mongolia, Albania, and Finland.

    In the past year, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Headquarters has done a lot of work for the cause of defending world peace and the movement to resist the United States and aid Korea, and has closely integrated it with the Sino-Soviet friendship work.

    In the future, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Headquarters will further strengthen its work and develop its organization on the existing basis. The association will focus on refuting the enemy's reactionary propaganda, fundamentally and systematically solving the ideological problems of the masses, greatly developing membership on the ideological basis of improving the correct understanding of the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet friendship among people from all walks of life, and will strive to enhance the great combat friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union in the struggle to defend world peace in all aspects.

    中苏友好协会的工作成绩首先表现在组织的迅速发展方面。现在全国共有两个大行政区，二十四个省，六个行署区，十三个大城市以及六十五个省和行署区所辖市，都已建立了友协组织。全国会员，自一九四九年十月到一九五零年十一月，已由七十万人发展到三百三十一万三千七百九十九人。各地会员的发展，并逐渐由城市扩展到广大农村，同时开始注意了吸收妇女会员。如湖北省的会员，农民占二分之一强；在湖北、天津等十个省、市的会员中，妇女会员平均占百分之十五以上。
    为了有系统地和广泛地介绍苏联先进的科学、文化和经济建设经验，中苏友好协会总会积极开展了有关方面书刊的编译出版和图片展览、电影放映等宣传服务工作，邀请苏联学者相继来我国讲学，以及在首都和各地广泛开展学习俄文工作，使干部和工作人员便利于学习苏联先进的经验。以上各项工作都受到广大人民的热烈欢迎。
    在国际联络方面，一年来，中苏友好协会总会和苏联对外文化协会取得了更密切的联系，并先后和波兰、捷克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜、保加利亚、德国、美国、英国、法国、日本、加拿大、蒙古、阿尔巴尼亚、芬兰等十五个国家的人民对苏友好协会建立了联系，交换了出版物。
    中苏友好协会总会在过去一年中，对保卫世界和平和抗美援朝运动，做了许多工作，并使其密切地与中苏友好工作结合起来了。
    今后，中苏友好协会总会将在已有的基础上，进一步加强工作，发展组织。该会将着重驳斥敌人的反动宣传，从根本上系统地解决群众的思想问题，在提高各界人民对苏联和中苏友好的正确认识的思想基础上大量发展会员，并将从各方面努力增进中苏两国人民在保卫世界和平的斗争中的伟大的战斗友谊。
