　　Cooperative Goods Station Work Should Take a Step Forward
    Zhou Jun
            A General Overview of Goods Station Work Over the Past Year
    Cooperative goods stations are a new type of institution in China's cooperative cause and are a better form of organizing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Under the current circumstances, cooperative goods stations assist in promoting the sale of rural native products, reduce the links in the commodity flow of cooperative trade, and accelerate commodity turnover, which plays a certain role. Therefore, thirty-eight cooperative goods stations have been established across the country in the past year. Taking the North China Cooperative Goods Station as an example, from July to October of last year, industrial and agricultural products worth a total of 160 billion yuan were transacted, with 107.6 billion yuan for purchased goods and 52.4 billion yuan for goods sold on consignment. Native products entering the city accounted for 28 percent, industrial products going to the countryside accounted for 72 percent, exchanges between cooperatives accounted for 10 percent, cooperatives and state-owned economic organizations accounted for 56 percent, cooperatives and private enterprises accounted for 23 percent, and market transactions accounted for 11 percent. Generally, goods stations operate three types of businesses: trust, warehousing, and transportation. Some also handle deposit and loan businesses. In terms of promoting the sale of native products and purchasing industrial products, they have basically achieved unified handling for each cooperative, cooperated with market management, and reduced the speculative market. However, there is a lack of organization, with mostly piecemeal transactions. After the goods enter the warehouse, customers are sought, which not only increases the cost of goods but is also very passive. For example, the North China Cooperative Goods Station planned to organize the sale of native products, but in four months there were only 50,000 blocks of large white flour, 300 tons of crude saltpeter, 120,000 catties of sulfur, 100,000 catties of bitter apricot kernels, and 3.6 million catties of edible salt. Most other items were sold as they arrived, remaining at the level of completing entrusted tasks.
            Moving a Step Forward from the Current Level
    First, change from current spot consignment to planned operation: At present, most cooperative goods stations operate trust businesses by finding outlets for native products brought in by various cooperatives, and purchasing industrial products on a temporary basis. Because goods enter and leave the warehouse, the cost of goods increases, and it is easy to form blindness and fall into passivity, which is not in line with the spirit of goods stations to "organize decentralized businesses into batch direct exchanges." Therefore, there must be a change, which requires:
    I. Strengthening investigation and research, closely contacting public and private enterprises, understanding what raw materials they need from rural areas, their quantity, quality, specifications, and prices, and signing agreements or contracts, and then organizing cooperatives to deliver goods. For example, Tianjin Zhongfang needs bamboo mats from southern Jiangsu, while the cooperatives in southern Jiangsu are struggling to find a market for bamboo mats. The goods station should organize this business to achieve direct transactions through the goods station. In this way, it can be changed from "each cooperative relying on the goods station to promote native products to the goods station supervising their delivery according to the contract." Make the goods station the organizer of actual business and the command center for procurement and sales.
    II. The key to the goods station's business breaking away from blindness and passivity lies in the realization of purchase and sale plan reporting. At present, most cooperatives do not have plans for purchasing and selling in the city, and the goods station cannot understand them in advance, so it can only wait for business. Therefore, it is also difficult to organize. In the future, cooperative goods stations must suggest that cooperatives at all levels submit purchase and sale plans in advance, along with samples of native products. The goods station will sign purchase and sale contracts with public and private enterprises according to the plans of each cooperative to sell and purchase. In this way, industrial and agricultural products can be purchased and sold according to plan, and goods can be directly sent to the warehouses of the user departments, reducing the links in commodity circulation and lowering the cost of commodities to achieve rational management. For example, the North China Cooperative Goods Station purchased 50,000 blocks of large white flour, 300 tons of crude saltpeter, 120,000 catties of sulfur, and 100,000 catties of bitter apricot kernels. Because they were directly delivered to the receiver's warehouse, the reduction in losses and miscellaneous expenses reached more than 30 million yuan. In addition, factories have relatively fixed customers for the supply of raw materials and the sales of products, which also makes it easier to achieve planned production.
    Secondly, strengthen the analysis and research of market information to guide business and more effectively carry out urban-rural trade. At present, the market information work of goods stations generally only lists phenomena and reports market conditions, ignoring analysis and research, so it lacks guidance for urban-rural exchanges. In the future, major commodities, especially native products, should be comprehensively introduced and analyzed, such as the supply and demand relationship in foreign markets and local markets, market changes, etc., and should be promptly communicated to cooperatives in various regions.
    Finally, strengthen the promotion of native products and enrich the business content of goods stations: One of the important tasks of cooperative goods stations is to connect urban-rural trade and accelerate the exchange of industrial and agricultural products. Only by vigorously opening up sales channels for native products, especially native medicinal materials that have been difficult to sell for more than ten years, can the purchasing power of farmers be improved, and can industrial products be massively sent to the countryside to serve farmers. Not only will industrial production develop accordingly, but also the business of goods stations will prosper. However, some goods stations have not paid enough attention to this in the past. For example, in the North China Cooperative Goods Station, the promotion of native products only accounted for 28 percent in four months. Because of neglecting to open up sales channels for native products, cooperatives sometimes have to bring money into the city to purchase goods, which does not achieve the purpose of urban-rural material exchange, and the funds have not played their full role. In the future, opening up sales channels for native products will be a central link in the business operation of goods stations. It is hoped that cooperative goods station cadres in various regions will work hard in this regard.

### 合作货栈工作应提高一步

　　合作货栈工作应提高一步
    周钧
            一年来货栈工作概况
    合作货栈是中国合作事业中的新型机构，是组织城乡物资交流的较好形式。在目前情况下，合作货栈协助推销农村土产，减少合作社贸易中商品流动环节，加速商品周转，是有一定作用的。因此在全国范围内，一年来已建立了三十八个合作货栈。仅以华北合作货栈而言，去年七月至十月四个月中，工农产品共成交一千六百亿元，代购一千零七十六亿元，代售五百二十四亿元，土产进城占百分之二十八，工业品下乡占百分之七十二，而社与社交换占百分之十，社与国营经济机构占百分之五十六，社与私人企业占百分之二十三，与市场交易占百分之十一。一般货栈均经营信托、仓库、运输三种业务，有的还兼办存放款业务。在推销土产采购工业品方面，已基本上作到统一代各社办理，配合了市场管理，缩小了投机市场，但缺乏组织性，多为零来零办，货入仓库后再去找顾主，不但增加了商品成本，而且十分被动。如华北合作货栈有计划地组织土产推销，四个月只有大白粉五万块，土硝三百吨，硫磺十二万斤，苦杏十万斤，食盐三百六十万斤，其他多为随来随售，停留在完成委托任务的水平上。
            要从现有水平提高一步
    首先由现货委托变为计划经营：目下一般合作货栈，经营信托业务，多是各社运来土产现找销路，需要工业品临时采购，由于货物出库入库，增加了商品成本，且易形成盲目性，陷于被动，不符合货栈“组织分散业务为成批直接交换”的精神，因此必须有所转变，这就必须：
    一、加强调查研究，密切公私企业的联系，了解他们需要农村什么原料、数量、质量、规格、价格，订好协议或合同，然后组织合作社交货。如天津中纺需要苏南的竹板，而苏南合作社对竹板正苦无销路，货栈就组织此项业务，使其通过货栈达到直接交易。这样，即可变“各社依货栈推销土产，为货栈监督其按合同交货”。使货栈成为实际业务的组织者及采购与推销的指挥台。
    二、货栈业务摆脱盲目性被动性的关键，在于购销计划造报的实现。目下各社进城购销，多无计划，货栈不能提前了解，只有坐等业务，因此也很难组织，今后合作货栈必须建议各级社提前造送购销计划，附送土产样品，货栈按各社所要推销与采购的计划，分别与公私企业，订立购销合同，这样工农产品，即可按计划购销，商品直发用货部门仓库，减少了商品流转环节，降低了商品的成本，达到经营合理化。如华北合作货栈采购了大白粉五万块，土硝三百吨，硫磺十二万斤，苦杏十万斤。由于直达收货者仓库，减少损失及小脚费即达三千余万元。此外，在工厂方面，因原料的供给，产品的销售，有了比较固定的主顾，亦易作到有计划的生产。
    其次是加强商情的分析研究工作，以便指导业务，更有利地开展城乡贸易工作。现在货栈的商情工作，一般的均是罗列现象，报道行情，忽视分析研究，因之对城乡交换，缺乏指导性。今后应对主要商品，特别是土产，要加以全面介绍分析，如国外市场及本市市场供求关系，市场变化等，要及时通报各地合作社。
    最后是加强土产推销，丰富货栈业务内容：合作货栈的重要任务之一，是沟通城乡贸易，加速工农产品的交换。只有大力给土产打开销路，特别是十几年来难销的土产药材，农民购买力提高了，工业品才能大量下乡为农民服务，不但工业生产随之发展，而货栈业务，亦随之繁荣。但过去有些货栈，对此注意是不够的。如华北合作货栈，在四个月中推销土产只占百分之二十八，因忽视开辟土产销路，各社有时只有带款进城购货，未达到城乡物资交流的目的，而资金也未发挥全部作用，今后开辟土产销路，是货栈在业务经营上中心的一环。望各地合作货栈干部，多在这方面努力。
