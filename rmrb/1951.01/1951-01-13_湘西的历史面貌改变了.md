　　The Historical Face of Western Hunan Has Changed
　　Zhou Chiping, Secretary of the CPC Western Hunan District Committee

　　A General Overview of Western Hunan

　　Western Hunan borders several provinces, including Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. It is a vast area with a population of 3.5 million, with Han and Miao people intermingling on the periphery. The region is characterized by steep mountains, barren land, and impoverished people. The foundation of feudal forces is extremely strong. Landlords and local bullies occupy the vast majority of land and possess more than approximately 80,000 guns, which they use as tools to rule and exploit the people. They exploit the people's poverty, cultural backwardness, ethnic divisions, and traffic stagnation to establish kingdoms, carve up territories, and maintain their political and economic privileges through armed plunder. In addition, the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and policy of sheltering bandits and harming the people further fueled the arrogance of the local bullies and bandits in Western Hunan. These heinous bandits committed all kinds of crimes, including murder, arson, rape, and looting. They were responsible for numerous deaths, with some individual bandits like Zhang Ping having over 500 lives on their hands. Cases of entire families being killed, three generations exterminated, and entire villages burned were common. They raped women, sparing neither the old nor the young. For example, bandit leader Wang Yuanhua raped more than 40 women. In 1949, when this bandit attacked Yuanling, more than 300 women were raped (56 of whom died from the rapes). The wicked Shuang Jingwu raped every woman he could, even forcing his own younger sister to death. They robbed homes and looted properties, leaving ten out of ten houses empty wherever they went. These fellows committed monstrous crimes against the people of Western Hunan, but they were not ashamed of being bandits, but rather took pride in it. Many bandits were bandits for generations, passing it down from generation to generation (some had been bandits for 24 generations), regarding banditry as a way to get promoted and become rich. For example, the habitual bandit Peng Yuqing started as a bandit with nothing and became wealthy. Therefore, being a bandit and doing evil was their shortcut to promotion and fortune. This created a historical factor and social root cause of the serious banditry in Western Hunan for decades or even centuries. Therefore, Western Hunan has always been a major problem for Hunan Province, hence the saying "Hunan does not become chaotic before Western Hunan becomes chaotic." The disaster-stricken people of Western Hunan lived in extreme poverty and misery under the bloody rule of the trinity of officials, bandits, and bullies.

　　After the Chinese People's Revolution achieved basic victory on the mainland, the Kuomintang reactionaries still attempted to use Western Hunan as their most "ideal" "anti-communist guerrilla base." They organized bandits, special agents, and various counter-revolutionary forces everywhere to carry out sabotage activities. The "commander-in-chief," "army commander," "division commander"... commissioned with empty promises were as numerous as hairs on an ox, attempting to rely on the natural barriers to resist us to the end. Some even pretended to surrender to the people while engaging in anti-people activities, vainly hoping that the People's Government would appoint them to official positions to preserve and expand their strength, dreaming of a third world war and waiting for an opportunity to restore their rule and continue to dominate the people. They even presumptuously asserted: "The situation in Western Hunan cannot be changed. It has not changed in the past, it has not changed now (referring to the early days of liberation), and it will not change in the future." At that time, although the people of Western Hunan hated the bandits to the bone and urgently demanded the suppression of bandits, some people, influenced by the long-term rule of the bandits, could not see the strength of the people themselves and the People's Army, and therefore had a misconception that the bandits could not be eliminated.

　　A Year of Great Transformation

　　However, in just one year, the situation in Western Hunan has undergone fundamental changes, and banditry, one of the special characteristics of Western Hunan, no longer exists. The bandits who attempted to resist us to the end have been successively killed, captured, or surrendered to us. Zhang Ping, the big bandit who had brazenly said "one battle wins the province, two battles win the country, three battles win complete victory," has also been killed by the people. All the reactionary bandit gangs' plans have failed. Western Hunan, which they had hoped to use as an "anti-communist guerrilla base," has become an increasingly consolidated rear area for national defense. Now it can be said that the banditry problem in Western Hunan has been basically resolved. This is due to the great efforts made by our entire Party, government, army, and people in the past year. In the extremely complex situation in Western Hunan, our basic principle has been to eliminate counter-revolutionary armed forces with revolutionary armed forces, and to resolutely eliminate counter-revolutionaries, thus solving the complex problems in Western Hunan. For a long time, we have regarded the suppression of bandits as the overriding task, adopting the strategy of concentrating forces to focus on suppressing bandits, launching surprise attacks, encirclements, repeated sweeps, and garrisoning and suppressing, which made the bandits panic-stricken and exhausted. At the same time, we vigorously launched political offensives, welcoming all those who voluntarily surrendered and were determined to reform, resolutely eliminating those who resisted stubbornly, and severely suppressing those who were guilty of heinous crimes and hated by the masses. Under such military strikes and political offensives, we annihilated more than 70,000 bandits in the past year. In completing the task of suppressing bandits, our army played a decisive role. The People's Army undertook the arduous and glorious task in the history of Western Hunan, overcame all insurmountable difficulties, endured all unbearable pains, climbed mountains and crossed ridges, day and night, endured hunger and cold, ate in the wind and slept in the dew. It was common practice to drink thin porridge for a week and a half, without oil or salt, and to march barefoot. In such a harsh environment, our army resolutely safeguarded the interests of the people, strictly observed mass discipline, and helped the masses in production and labor, establishing a deep class affection with the people. They made indelible contributions to the people of Western Hunan and created unprecedented miracles in the history of Western Hunan.

　　Mass Bandit Suppression Movement

　　The great strength of the people of Western Hunan was also demonstrated in the suppression of bandits. In order to relieve their suffering and to avoid being ravaged by bandits again, they actively supported their army, scouting out situations, sending messages, leading the way, transporting grain and grass, and carrying the wounded. In order to defend their victory, the people demanded to be armed, so they organized tens of thousands of militiamen, and continued to develop and strengthen them. Local armed forces have also been established, and they have actively cooperated with the main forces in combat, undertaking the task of consolidating the central areas, capturing scattered bandits, arresting bandit leaders, and collecting bandit guns. In the past year, there have also been militia heroes like Ma Qingfu who annihilated more than 70 bandits, and models of clearing bandits and collecting guns like Wu Zilong who collected more than 400 guns, as well as typical figures like Zhang Gaosheng and his son, Chen Sanbao's landlady, and Liu Fangcai who sent messages, led the way, and captured the big bandit leaders Zhang Ping, Chen Zixian, and Chen Cexun. Therefore, the simple army bandit suppression has become a bandit suppression movement of the main force, local armed forces, militia, and the broad masses of people, creating a situation where the bandits are like "rats running across the street, with everyone shouting to beat them." This proves that the strength of the people is irresistible.

　　Development of Various Works

　　With the victory of bandit suppression, since April last year, the broad masses of Western Hunan have launched a large-scale anti-feudal struggle. Except for a few minority areas, the anti-bullying and rent reduction movement has gradually developed from areas with a population of 2 million to areas with a population of more than 3 million. In areas where anti-bullying and rent reduction have been carried out, the class consciousness of the peasants has been initially raised, they have established their own organization - the peasants' association, and have developed nearly 500,000 members. The masses have obtained the fruits of the struggle, coupled with government relief, grain loans, loans, and work-for-food programs, which have partially solved the difficulties of means of production and means of livelihood, and have improved the masses' enthusiasm for production. Therefore, under the leadership of the government, they completed arduous tasks such as drought resistance and pest control in a timely manner, successfully overcome disasters, and achieved a harvest of 90%. These have prepared favorable conditions for the upcoming land reform and large-scale production movement.

　　With the victory of bandit suppression and the development of the mass movement, under the correct policy guidance of the higher levels, taxes, public bonds, and public grain have been completed according to the numbers or exceeded the tasks. Furthermore, due to the restoration of transportation, urban-rural assistance and internal and external exchanges have been carried out in trade, ensuring a steady stream of daily necessities into the rural areas, and rural native products (tung oil and timber) have been continuously transported out, stabilizing prices, improving the credibility of the Renminbi, restoring and partially developing commerce, and prospering the economy.

　　In the past year, in completing the above tasks, our entire cadres and staff have experienced severe tests, strengthened their class viewpoints, and improved their work abilities. And in practical work, they have cultivated a group of peasant cadres and activists who have close ties with the local masses, preparing good conditions for future work. The people of all strata in Western Hunan have gradually improved their awareness, recognized the people's own government and army, and therefore, in the great movement of the people of the whole country to oppose imperialist aggression and defend world peace, the number of people in Western Hunan who signed for peace reached 1.2 million. Today, in the call to resist America and aid Korea, workers, peasants, and young students are also responding enthusiastically.

　　湘西的历史面貌改变了
    中共湘西区党委书记  周赤萍
    湘西的历史概况
    湘西与鄂、川、黔、桂数省接壤，地区广大，人口三百五十万，边缘汉苗杂居，境内丛山峻岭，地瘠民贫。封建势力基础极为雄厚。地主恶霸占有绝对多数的土地，并拥有约八万以上的枪支，作为他们统治压榨人民的工具。他们利用人民生活的贫困，文化上的落后，民族间的隔阂与交通的闭塞，称王称霸，割据一方，以武装掠夺来保持其政治上经济上的特权统治。加之国民党反动统治的纵匪害民政策，更助长了湘西恶霸土匪的气焰。这些罪大恶极的匪霸，杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，无所不为。他们都犯有数条数十条至数百条人命案件，仅大匪霸张平即有五百条以上的人命案，人民被杀全家、灭三族、烧全村者屡见不鲜。他们强奸妇女，老幼亦难幸免。如匪首汪援华强奸民女即达四十余人。一九四九年该匪攻入沅陵，被强奸者达三百余人（其中奸死者达五十六人）。恶贯满盈的双景伍无妇不奸，胞妹亦被其逼奸而死。他们打家劫舍，所到之处十室十空。这些家伙对湘西人民犯下了弥天大罪，而却不以当匪为耻，反以为荣。许多土匪都是代代为匪，辈辈相传（有二十四代当匪的），以当匪升官，以当匪发家。如惯匪彭玉清即是以空手当匪起家而致富，因而为匪作恶就是他们升官发财的捷径。这就造成了湘西数十年至数百年严重匪患的历史因素与社会根源。所以，湘西历来就是湖南的大病，故有“湖南未乱湘西先乱”之说。灾难深重的湘西人民，在官、匪、霸三位一体的血腥统治下，饥寒交迫，苦不堪言。
    当中国人民革命在全国大陆上取得基本胜利之后，国民党反动派仍企图以湘西作为他们最“理想”的“反共游击基地”，到处组织土匪特务及各种反革命势力进行破坏活动，空头支票加委的“总司令”、“军长”、“师长”……多似牛毛，企图凭依天险，与我顽抗到底。有的更假投靠人民之名，而行反人民之实，妄想人民政府委官委职，以保存实力，扩大实力，梦想第三次世界大战，待机复辟，以达其继续统治人民之目的。他们更妄自断言：“湘西局势不可变，从前没有变，现在（按指解放初期）没有变，将来也不会变。”而当时湘西人民虽对土匪恨之入骨，迫切要求剿匪，但也有一些人因受匪长期统治，看不到人民自己和人民军队的力量，因而产生一种错觉，也曾认为土匪是无法消灭的。
    伟大转变的一年
    但是为时仅仅一年，湘西情况已起了根本的变化，作为湘西特殊性之一的匪患已不复存在了。企图与我顽抗到底的匪徒们，都已相继被击毙被俘掳或向我投降。曾经大言不惭地说过“一仗胜省、二仗胜国、三仗全胜”的大土匪张平，也早被人民打死了。反动匪帮的一切打算都落了空，他们曾妄想作为“反共游击基地”的湘西已变成为日趋巩固的国防后方了。现在可以说，湘西的匪患问题已基本解决了。这是由于一年来我全体党政军民作了极大的努力，在湘西万般复杂的情况下，我们的基本方针就是以革命的武装消灭反革命的武装以坚决消灭反革命，解决了湘西的复杂问题。在长时期中，我们曾把剿匪作为压倒一切的首要任务，在军事上采取了集中兵力重点进剿的方针，奔袭合围，反复扫荡，清剿驻剿，使土匪惊魂丧胆，疲于奔命。与此同时我则大力开展政治攻势，对自动投降确愿改过自新的一概表示欢迎，对顽抗者则坚决予以消灭，对罪大恶极、群众痛恨的给予严厉镇压。就在这样的军事打击与政治攻势下，一年来我们共歼灭了七万多土匪。在完成剿匪任务中，我们的军队起了决定性的作用。人民军队担负了湘西历史上艰巨而光荣的任务，克服了一切难以克服的困难，忍受了一切难以忍受的痛苦，爬山越岭，日以继夜，忍饥挨冻，风餐露宿，一周半月喝稀饭，没油没盐，赤足行军，是司空见惯习以为常。就在这样的艰苦环境下，我们的军队仍坚决维护了人民的利益，严格遵守了群众纪律，并帮助了群众生产劳作，与人民建立了深厚的阶级感情。他们为湘西人民立下了不可磨灭的功勋，创造了湘西历史上未有的奇迹。
    群众性的剿匪运动
    在剿匪中也同样表现了湘西人民的伟大力量。为了解除自己的痛苦，为了再不受土匪的蹂躏，他们积极支援了自己的军队，侦察情况，送信带路，运粮草，抬伤员。为了保卫自己的胜利，人民要求武装起来，于是组织了数万民兵，并在继续发展壮大。地方武装亦已建立，他们积极配合主力作战，担负了巩固中心区的任务，捕捉散匪，缉拿匪首，清挤匪枪。一年来，更出现了歼匪七十余名的麻清富式的民兵英雄，挤枪四百多支的伍子龙式的清匪挤枪模范，以及送信带路捉拿大匪首张平、陈子贤、陈策勋的张高升父子、陈三宝老板娘和刘芳财等典型人物。因此，从单纯的军队剿匪变成了主力、地方武装、民兵及广大群众大联合的剿匪运动，对土匪造成了“老鼠过街人人喊打”的形势。这证明了人民的力量是不可抗拒的。
    各项工作的开展
    随着剿匪的胜利，去年四月以来，湘西广大群众即展开了较大规模的反封建的斗争，除少数民族地区外，反霸减租运动已逐渐由二百万人口的地区发展到三百万以上人口的地区。凡是经过反霸减租的地区，农民的阶级觉悟已初步提高，建立了自己的组织——农会，发展了近五十万会员。群众得到斗争果实并加上政府的救济、贷粮、贷款和以工代赈后，已部分地解决了生产资料和生活资料的困难，提高了群众的生产积极性；因而在政府领导下适时完成了抗旱灭虫等艰巨工作，顺利度过了灾荒，并达到九成丰收的年景。这些为即将到来的土地改革和大生产运动准备了有利的条件。
    随着剿匪的胜利和群众运动的开展，在上级的正确的政策指导下，税收、公债和公粮均按数完成或超过任务。更由于交通的恢复，在贸易方面开展了城乡互助，内外交流，保证了源源不断的日用必需品输入农村，农村的土产（桐油和木材）亦源源不断地外运，稳定了物价，提高了人民币的信用，恢复与部分发展了商业，繁荣了经济。
    一年来，在完成上述任务中，我全体干部和工作人员经历了严重的考验，加强了阶级观点，提高了工作能力。并在实际工作中培养了一批与当地群众有密切联系的农民干部和积极分子，为今后各项工作准备了良好的条件。湘西各阶层人民则由于觉悟程度逐步提高，认清了人民自己的政府和军队，因而在全国人民反对帝国主义侵略保卫世界和平的伟大运动中，湘西和平签名的人数达一百二十万，今天在抗美援朝声中，工人农民和青年学生亦在热烈响应。
