　　Openly Tearing Up International Agreements Such as the Cairo Declaration
    The United States Actually Attempts to Conclude a Separate Peace with Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th] On December 28th of last year, the United States government submitted a memorandum regarding the issue of the Japanese peace treaty to Soviet representative to the Security Council, Malik, in response to the questions raised by the Soviet Union in its memorandum to the United States on November 20th of last year. In this new memorandum, the United States government openly expressed its aggressive ambition to tear up international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration and seize our country's territories of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. The United States government could not deny in its memorandum that "the 1943 Cairo Declaration had stated that 'Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China'," but it then shamelessly said, "Like other wartime declarations of Yalta and Potsdam, the United States government believes that this declaration should be decided by any final treaty that must consider various relevant factors." The United States also reiterated in the memorandum its unreasonable demands to霸占occupy the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands.
    The Chinese people suffered a long period of aggression by Japanese imperialism, with significant losses of life and property, and defeated Japanese imperialism through eight years of bloody resistance. However, the United States government is attempting to exclude the sole legal government representing the Chinese people – the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China – from participating in the sacred right to prepare, draft, and sign a peace treaty with Japan. The memorandum stated: "The current talks are being conducted by the United States through diplomatic channels, and as the Soviet Union is aware, the United States has no diplomatic relations with the so-called 'People's Republic of China government'."
    The memorandum once again nakedly demonstrated the United States' determination to abandon the 1942 January 1st Declaration by United Nations, which guaranteed not to conclude a separate peace with enemy countries, and the principle of great power consensus, and to attempt to conclude a separate peace with Japan. The memorandum said brazenly, "The United States does not believe that any one country has a permanent and unchangeable right to veto other countries from concluding a peace treaty with Japan."
    At the same time, the United States in the memorandum violently violated the Potsdam Proclamation and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, unscrupulously declaring its intention to occupy Japan for a long time and intensify the arming of Japan in order to turn Japan into an instrument of aggression for the United States in the Far East. The memorandum stated: "Japan should participate with the United States and other countries in individual and collective defense measures stipulated in the United Nations Charter, especially Article 51. These measures may include provisions for the stationing of troops from the United States and other countries in Japan." The United States also reiterated the absurd claims it made in the previous memorandum, attempting to arm Japan and retain military bases in Japan.
    The reactionary stance of the United States government on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty, as revealed in this memorandum, will inevitably arouse resolute opposition from the people of all countries, especially those countries that have suffered brutal devastation at the hands of Japanese imperialism.

### 公然撕毁开罗宣言等国际协定  美国竟妄图与日本单独媾和

　　公然撕毁开罗宣言等国际协定
    美国竟妄图与日本单独媾和
    【新华社六日讯】去年十二月二十八日，美国政府以关于对日和约问题的备忘录一件递交苏联驻安全理事会代表马立克，答复苏联在去年十一月二十日致美国的备忘录中所提出的问题。美国政府在这一新备忘录中，公然表示了要撕毁开罗宣言等国际协定而强占我国领土台湾、澎湖列岛的侵略野心。美国政府在其备忘录中无法否认：“一九四三年的开罗宣言已经声明把‘满洲、台湾与澎湖列岛归还中国’”，但它随即无耻地说：“这个宣言也像雅尔塔与波茨坦的其他战时宣言一样，美国政府认为应该由必须考虑各种有关因素的任何最后和约来决定。”美国并在备忘录中重申它要霸占琉球群岛与小笠原群岛的无理要求。
    中国人民遭受日本帝国主义长期侵略，生命财产遭受重大损失，并以八年流血牺牲的抗战击败了日本帝国主义。但是，美国政府却妄图排斥代表中国人民的唯一合法政府——中华人民共和国中央人民政府参加准备、拟制与签订对日和约的神圣权利。备忘录声称：“目前的会谈，正由美国通过外交途径予以进行中，而有如苏联所熟知的，美国与所谓‘中华人民共和国政府’是没有外交关系的。”
    备忘录再次赤裸裸地表明美国决意背弃保证不与敌国单独媾和的一九四二年一月一日联合国家共同宣言与大国一致的原则，而企图与日本单独媾和。备忘录无赖地说：“美国并不认为：任何一国有一种永久不变的权力可以否决其他国家和日本缔结和约”。
    美国在备忘录中同时横暴地违背波茨坦公告及远东委员会决定，肆无忌惮地声言要长期占领日本和加紧武装日本，以便把日本变为美国在远东的侵略工具。备忘录说：“日本理应和美国及其他国家一道参加联合国宪章特别是第五十一条所规定的个别和集体防御措置。这些措置可以包括美国和其他国家的军队驻在日本的规定。”美国并重申它在前次备忘录中所提出的企图武装日本及保留在日本的军事基地的荒谬主张。
    美国政府在这一备忘录中所暴露出来的它在对日和约问题上的反动立场，必将引起一切国家人民、特别是曾经惨遭日本帝国主义野蛮蹂躏的各国人民的坚决反对。
