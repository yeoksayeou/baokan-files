Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 29th (TASS): Hundreds of delegates from various states of West Germany, all peace advocates, convened the first congress against remilitarization on the 28th in Essen, the center of the Ruhr area. They reviewed various specific measures for the struggle against arming West Germany. The congress was convened by a special preparatory committee composed of representatives of all strata of people in West Germany.

The congress, on behalf of the German people, sent a declaration to the Bonn "government," demanding a referendum on the question: "Do you oppose the remilitarization of West Germany and support the signing of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951?" The declaration stated: "We call on all parties, trade unions, Catholic and Evangelical churches, individuals, groups, and various committees to support the demand for a referendum submitted to the federal government. Let us all guarantee to exert every effort to carry out the referendum."

The declaration emphasized the significance of this vote, stating: "If the German people use their democratic rights to decide their own destiny, to decide the question of war or peace, and express their protest against remilitarization through a referendum, then obstacles will arise on the road to a third world war, and peace can be saved."

The congress elected a preparatory committee to lead the people's movement to protest remilitarization. Representatives of all strata of people in West Germany participate in this committee.
