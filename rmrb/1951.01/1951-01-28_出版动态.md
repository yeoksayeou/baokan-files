Publishing News

      Original Copyright Notice Should be Included in Translated Books
    The General Administration of Publications has issued a unified regulation, notifying all publishers and bookstores to pay attention, because Chinese publishers generally do not include the original title, author, and publisher's name in the original language when publishing translated books, resulting in different translations of the same original work, making it difficult to verify. The regulations are as follows: (1) Starting from 1951, when publishing translated books, in addition to clearly stating the translator's name, publisher's name, edition, and publication date, the following must also be indicated on the copyright page: 1. The original foreign language title of the book, 2. The original author's foreign language name, 3. The name of the original publisher, 4. The original edition and publication date. (If the book is a retranslation, it should be stated as such, and the foreign language title of the translated edition, the translator's foreign language name, the publisher's name, the edition, and the publication date should be included.) (2) If translated books are translated from foreign newspapers and periodicals, the original foreign language name of the newspaper or periodical, issue number, publication date, and publication location should be indicated in the book. (3) When reprinting or retypesetting previously published translated books in 1951, the above first and second items should be followed.

      Division of Labor Between Publishing and Distribution
    The "China Book Distribution Company," a joint distribution organization formed by Sanlian Bookstore, Zhonghua Book Company, Commercial Press, Kaiming Bookstore, and Lianying Bookstore, has been established. The company has more than eighty distribution units, distributed in thirty-five cities across the country, making it the largest book distribution organization in the country besides Xinhua Bookstore. The China Book Distribution Company is a product of the National Publishing Conference held in September last year. According to the resolution of the Publishing Conference on "division of labor between publishing and distribution," the five bookstores, Sanlian, Zhonghua, Commercial Press, Kaiming, and Lianying, decided to form a joint distribution organization and convened a joint cadre meeting of the five units in November and December last year. The meeting unanimously approved the resolution to separate the original distribution departments of the five companies and jointly organize the China Book Distribution Company. After active preparations, the general management office has been established in Beijing and started operations this month.
    In addition, Sanlian, Zhonghua, Commercial Press, and Kaiming have all determined their professional publishing directions in the publishing sector. Sanlian focuses on finance and economics, Zhonghua focuses on agriculture and medicine, Commercial Press focuses on science and engineering, and Kaiming focuses on reading materials for middle school students.

      The Launch of the Reading Campaign
    According to the resolutions of the First National Publishing Conference and the Second Working Conference of Xinhua Bookstore, "Xinhua Bookstore should lead public and private distribution organizations to jointly assist factories, mines, rural areas, troops, government agencies, and schools in establishing libraries, reading rooms, reading groups, and newspaper and book supply stations to promote the reading campaign," the General Management Office of Xinhua Bookstore has been focusing on promoting the reading campaign among workers, peasants, and soldiers nationwide since last winter. Last winter, a set of popular reading materials suitable for workers, peasants, and soldiers, "Reading Campaign Series" (most of which were ordered from private publishing houses), with 300 titles per set, was printed with 20,000 sets, and sold at half price to worker-peasant-soldier libraries through allocation. As for vigorously developing the movement to establish small libraries, taking East China as an example, the East China General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore plans to assist in establishing 12,000 libraries in the entire region (excluding Shandong) in 1951, including 3,500 in rural areas, 1,000 in cities, 3,000 in the military, and 4,500 in party and government agencies in various counties and districts. Shandong, because of its better foundation, plans to build 1,000 new libraries and organize 2,000 study groups or reading groups this year. In the Northeast, more than 5,000 small rural libraries have been organized a year ago.

      Primary School Textbooks for the Troops are Being Published Continuously
    In order to improve the cultural level of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission has compiled a set of primary school textbooks for the troops, including five subjects: Chinese, Arithmetic, History, Geography, and Nature. The published books include six volumes of Chinese and five volumes of Arithmetic. Other textbooks will continue to be published. This set of teaching materials is for the general use of the entire People's Liberation Army, and its publication is a major event in the cultural construction of the troops.

      Newly Published Good Books
    "Reference Atlas of Chinese History," edited by Zheng Zhenduo, published by the Publication Committee of the Reference Atlas of Chinese History, distributed by Shanghai Publishing Company, has been published since March 1947, and fourteen issues have been published. Originally single pages, packaged in sets, a combined edition has been added since December last year. There are currently four versions, two hardcover versions (cotton paper and native paper) and two popular versions (A and B). This atlas collects pictures related to Chinese history, with very rich content, including stoneware, pottery, oracle bones, bells and tripods, sculptures, funerary objects, murals, coins, bamboo slips, calligraphy and painting, historical sites, scenic spots, etc. It is a valuable reference material for Chinese history researchers and is of great help to the teaching of Chinese history in universities and middle schools.
    Youth Publishing House plans to compile a set of "Soviet Youth Work Experience Series" to introduce the experience of Soviet youth work, study, and life, for youth work cadres and general youth with middle school education or above. "History of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League" (edited by the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League, translated by Liu Binyan) is one of this series. This book summarizes the glorious fighting history of the Soviet Communist Youth League from its establishment in 1918 to the post-war Five-Year Plan period—the history of making contributions to the motherland. It is a good book for youth work cadres and general youth to study and research in depth. (This book has 176 pages, base price 6.80 yuan)
    "World History of Education" by M.D. Mityansky, translated by Ye Wenxiong, published by Sanlian Bookstore (578 pages, base price 27.50 yuan), analyzes and criticizes the education systems and theories unique to each historical stage in the three periods of ancient, medieval, and modern times, as well as the late modern education before World War II. In several chapters on modern education, it points out that after entering the corrupt stage of imperialism, the capitalist countries' education also entered its corrupt stage. The newly published "Pedagogy" Vol. 1 by Kairov, translated by Shen Ying, Nan Zhishan, etc., published by People's Publishing House (282 pages, base price 13.60 yuan), also explains the essence of education in various historical stages, and discusses the purpose and tasks of communist education, and discusses the teaching process, education and teaching content, basic methods of teaching work, teaching methods, and testing and grading methods in special chapters.
    People's Publishing House has compiled descriptions and records of the heroic deeds of national combat heroes and labor models published in newspapers and magazines across the country, and published two books: "Interviews with Combat Heroes" and "Interviews with Labor Models." The former has 142 pages and is priced at 4,400 yuan; the latter has 251 pages and is priced at 7,500 yuan.

      About Chairman Mao's Pictures
    "People's Pictorial" Volume 2, Issue 1 published twenty-four pictures of Chairman Mao under the general title "The Great Leader of the Chinese People, Chairman Mao Zedong." These include some valuable records from the life history of Chairman Mao Zedong from 1919 to 1950. The cover of this issue of the pictorial uses a pomegranate sculpture of Chairman Mao, and a color portrait of Chairman Mao by Lao Xianhong is inserted in the photo collection.
    However, several of Chairman Mao's photos in this issue of the pictorial are not printed well, especially a photo from 1934 is particularly blurred. This is an inexcusable serious shortcoming.
    "New Observer" Volume 2, Issue 2 also published four pictures of "Chairman Mao's Hometown" inside the cover. Unfortunately, among these four photos, except for the first one, the other three were not well chosen. One of them is actually the Mao family ancestral hall. May I ask, does publishing this kind of photo have any meaning? It should be said that this is a big oversight by the editors of "New Observer."
    Publishing texts and pictures about Chairman Mao is welcome, but this is only right if this work is carried out seriously. We must never "promote" Chairman Mao with incorrect and meaningless materials (whether text or pictures) and unclear images.

      "Chinese Workers" Seriously Conducts Self-Criticism
    "Chinese Workers" monthly magazine published "Review of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on Publishing 'Chinese Workers' Monthly' and Resolution on Strengthening Leadership of 'Chinese Workers' Monthly' in the Future" in the tenth issue. The resolution made serious criticisms on the lack of leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the publication, and proposed specific methods for correction. This resolution is worth noting for all national publications, especially the publications of various agencies and organizations. Since this resolution, "Chinese Workers" has begun to improve.
    The twelfth issue of "Chinese Workers," published in January, also published an article "Our Review," accepting the criticism in Book Review No. 12 of this newspaper, stating: "In addition to accepting the criticism from the People's Daily and conducting self-criticism, we must take the responsibility of strengthening the education of current events for the working masses in the future."

      Newly Published Financial and Economic Periodicals
    The Central People's Government Taxation Administration launched its official publication, "Central Taxation Gazette" (bi-weekly), on the first of this month. It publishes: national tax policies and regulations, explanations and case examples of various tax regulations and rules, general tax questions and answers, typical examples of taxpayers and tax workers, and other relevant financial and taxation treatises. The inaugural issue has an article "Welcoming 1951," which specifically points out the new tasks of taxation in 1951.
    Another new financial and economic publication is "New Accounting," edited by New Accounting Monthly Magazine, distributed by Beijing Xinchao Bookstore, launched on the 25th of this month. Its main task is to convey government accounting laws, systems, regulations, and rules, study specialized accounting issues, and introduce Soviet accounting experience.
    In order to improve the professional level of trade workers across the country, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government launched "Business Learning" (small bi-weekly) on the 5th of this month. The content mainly includes: answers to difficult questions, rationalization proposals, and introductions to typical experiences. To suit the nature of this publication, it would be better if the title were changed to "Trade Business Learning."

      Other Newly Published Periodicals
    In addition to the periodicals that have been individually reported in this publication, according to the existing materials, there are also the following twenty types of periodicals launched in December last year and this month. 1. Comprehensive Current Affairs: "Propaganda Handbook," published in East China; "Propagandist Handbook," published in Northwest China; "Propagandist," published in Central South China; "Propaganda Handbook," published by Tianjin Knowledge Bookstore, all of the above are bi-weekly, and there is also "Southern Weekly," compiled and printed by Guangzhou Southern Daily. 2. Reading Materials for Workers and Peasants: "Worker's Home" bi-weekly, published by Northeast Worker Publishing House; "Hebei Rural Areas" bi-weekly, published by Hebei People's Publishing House. 3. Cultural and Educational: "Wentong Teaching News" bi-weekly, published by Henan Cultural and Educational Publishing House; "Chongqing Education" monthly, published by Chongqing Education Society. 4. Financial and Economic: "Chongqing Industry and Commerce" monthly, "Tianjin Industry and Commerce" monthly. 5. Literary and Artistic: "Chahar Literature and Art" monthly; "Western Sichuan Literature and Art" monthly; "Literary and Artistic Front" monthly, compiled and printed by the Political Department of East China Military Region, Third Field Army. 6. Scientific and Technological: "Chinese Journal of Surgery" monthly, published by Nanjing East China Medical Book Publishing House; "East China Health" monthly and "Medical Life" bi-monthly, published by East China Medical Life Society. 7. Youth: "New Youth Daily" weekly, the organ of the Central South Working Committee of the Youth League. 8. Children: "Chongqing Children," published by Chongqing Children's Society. 9. Pictorials: "South China Pictorial," published by South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles; "Current Affairs Pictorial" tri-daily, published by Shanghai Current Affairs Pictorial Society.

      Periodicals are Developing the Propaganda of Patriotism
    In some recently published periodicals, a good development trend has emerged—putting the propaganda of patriotism on the agenda. "Chinese Youth" Issue 56 published articles such as "New China and New Patriotism," "Several Issues on Patriotism," and "Learning from Lenin's Example of Patriotism," making correct explanations and calls for patriotism. "People's Education" Volume 2, Issues 2 and 3, successively published articles introducing Soviet patriotic education. "New China" Volume 14, Issue 2 also published two articles, "Several Basic Issues of New Patriotism" and "On Lu Xun's Patriotism." "China Light Industry" Volume 1, Issue 4, "Tianjin Industry and Commerce" inaugural issue, and Harbin "Industry and Commerce Weekly" Issue 107 all reported on the patriotic covenant movement in the industrial and commercial circles. "Scientific Bulletin" Volume 1, Issue 8 published "Symposium on the Scientific Community Resisting America and Aiding Korea to Defend the Homeland," reflecting the patriotism of scientific workers. "New China Women" Issue 18 and "Modern Women" Volume 2, Issue 1 conducted propaganda and reports on the current affairs patriotic education and patriotic competition for female workers, and the patriotic movement of housewives. "Chinese Workers" Issue 12 began to strengthen the education of current events for the working masses. "Production and Technology" published in Shanghai issued a special issue on the patriotic production competition (Volume 5, Issue 12); "Worker's Home" in Northeast China called for insisting on the regularity of the patriotic production competition and preventing sudden attacks. Surrounding the slogan "Love Our Motherland," "Outlook" Volume 7, Issue 2 opened a column "Love Our Motherland"; "Beijing Workers" Issue 5 "Our Motherland is Truly Great" used text and pictures to inspire thoughts and feelings of loving the motherland; "Chinese Children" had an article "The Northeast is Truly Lovely" that well outlined the lovely face of the Northeast for children. "Kaiming Children" Issue 65 had an article "Southeast Northwest" explaining the breadth of the motherland from a geographical point of view.

　　出版动态
            翻译书籍应刊载原本版权说明
    出版总署因为我国出版家出版翻译书籍时，一般多未载明原书、原作者及原出版者之原文名，致同一原本，译名互异，难以查考，特作了一个统一规定，通知各出版社和书店注意。规定是这样：（一）自一九五一年起，出版翻译书籍，除翻译人姓名、出版者名称、版次、出版年月等仍应一一载明外，并须在版权页上分别刊明一、原著外文书名，二、原作者外文姓名，三、原出版者名称，四、原本版次及出版年月。（如系转译书籍，应说明转译，并刊载所依据之译本的外文书名、译者外文姓名、出版者名称、版次、出版年月。）（二）翻译书籍，如系译自外文报章、期刊，应在书籍中刊明原报章、期刊的外文名称、期数、出版日期、出版地点。（三）过去已出版的翻译书籍，在一九五一年再版或重排出版时，应照以上第一第二项办理。
            出版与发行分工
    由三联书店、中华书局、商务印书馆、开明书店、联营书店五家所组织的联合发行机构“中国图书发行公司”已经成立。这个公司共有八十多个发行单位，分布在全国三十五个城市，是新华书店以外全国最大规模的图书发行机关。中国图书发行公司是去年九月间全国出版会议以后的产物。三联、中华、商务、开明、联营五家书店，依照出版会议“出版与发行分工”的决议，决定筹组联合发行机构，于去年十一、二月间召开五单位联合干部会议。会议中一致通过了将五家原有发行部分划出来共同组织中国图书发行公司的决议。会后经积极筹备，已经在北京成立总管理处，于本月起开始办公。
    又，三联、中华、商务、开明四家在出版部分，都已确定了出版的专业方向。三联以财经为重点，中华以农业、医药为重点，商务以理工为重点，开明以中学程度青年读物为重点。
            读书运动的展开
    新华书店总管理处根据第一届全国出版会议和新华书店第二届工作会议决议“新华书店应领导公私发行机构共同协助工厂、矿山、农村、部队、机关、学校建立图书馆、阅览室、读书会、书报供应站等，以开展读书运动”的精神，从去年冬季起已在全国范围内有重点地推进工农兵群众的读书运动。去冬组织了一套适合工农兵群众需要的通俗读物的《读书运动丛书》（其中大部分是向私营出版业订货的），每套三百种，共印了二万套，以配售的方式半价发售给工农兵图书室。至于大力发展建立小型图书室运动，以华东区为例，新华书店华东区总分店计划在全区（山东不在内）于一九五一年内协助建立一万二千个，其中农村的三千五百个，城市的一千个，部队的三千个，另外各县区党政机关四千五百个。山东因为原有基础较好，准备在本年内新建图书室一千个，并组织两千个学习小组或读书会。东北方面，在一年前已经组织了五千余处农村小型图书室。
            部队小学课本陆续出版中
    为了提高人民解放军战士的文化水平，人民革命军事委员会总政治部编印了一套部队小学课本，计分国语、算术、历史、地理和自然等五科。现在已经出版的有国语六册、算术五册，其他课本也将继续出版。这套教材是供全体解放军通用的，它的出版是部队文化建设中的一件大事。
            新近出版的好书
    《中国历史参考图谱》，郑振铎编辑，中国历史参考图谱刊行委员会出版，上海出版公司发行，自一九四七年三月起刊行，现在已经出版了十四辑。原为单页，分辑函装，去年十二月起，增出合订本。现有四种版本，精装本两种（分棉料纸本、本造纸本）普及本两种（甲种、乙种）。这图谱搜罗有关中国历史的图片，内容非常丰富，包括石器、陶器、甲骨、钟鼎、雕塑、明器、壁画、钱币、简牍、书画、古迹、名胜等等，是中国历史研究者的珍贵参考资料，对大、中学本国历史教学也有极大帮助。
    青年出版社计划编印一套《苏联青年工作经验丛书》，介绍苏联青年工作、学习、生活的经验，供中等以上文化水平的青年工作干部和一般青年阅读。《苏联列宁共产主义青年团团史》（苏联列宁共产主义青年团中委宣传鼓动部编，刘宾雁译）是这套丛书之一。这本书总结了苏联共青团自一九一八年成立以来直到苏联战后五年计划期间三十几年来的光荣战斗的历史——为祖国立功的历史，是青年工作干部和一般青年应该深入钻研、学习的一本好书。（本书一七六页，基价六·八○元）
    三联书店版，米定斯基著、叶文雄译的《世界教育史》（五七八页、基价二七·五○），把古代、中世纪、近代等三个时期和第二次世界大战前的晚近教育，按着各个历史阶段特有的教育体系和学说，作了分析与批判。在近代教育的几编中指出进入了腐朽的帝国主义阶段后的资本主义国家，它的教育同样进入了它的腐朽阶段。人民出版社新出的《教育学》上册，凯洛夫著，沈颖、南致善等译（二八二页，基价一三·六○元），也说明了各个历史阶段中教育的本质，并讨论了共产主义教育的目的与任务，对教学过程、教育和教学内容、教学工作的基本方式、教学法、测验与评分方法都以专章进行了讨论。
    人民出版社汇集了各地报章杂志所发表的关于全国战斗英雄和劳动模范的英雄模范事迹的叙述和记载，出版了两本书：《战斗英雄访问记》和《劳动模范访问记》。前书一四二页，定价四四○○元；后书二五一页，定价七五○○元。
            关于毛主席的图片
    人民画报二卷一期发表了总题为《中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席》的二十四幅关于毛主席的照片。这里面包括了从一九一九年到一九五○年的毛泽东主席生活史中的一些珍贵的纪录。这一期画报的封面用了石榴作的毛主席浮雕像，在照片集中插了一幅老宪洪作的毛主席彩色画像。
    但是这一期画报的毛主席照片中有好几幅都印刷得不好，一九三四年的一幅尤其模糊。这是一个不应有的严重的缺点。
    新观察二卷二期在封里也刊印了《毛主席的故乡》照片四幅。很可惜，在这四幅照片中，除第一幅外，其他三幅都选择得不好。其中竟有一幅是毛家宗祠。试问发表这种照片难道有任何一点意义吗？应当说，这是新观察编辑部很大的疏忽。
    发表有关毛主席的文字和图片是值得欢迎的，但是这只有在认真地进行这个工作的条件下才是对的。我们决不应当以不正确的和无意义的材料（无论文字或图片）以及不清楚的画面来“宣传”毛主席。
            《中国工人》认真进行自我批评
    《中国工人》月报在第十期上曾发表《中华全国总工会对于出版中国工人月报的检讨及今后加强对中国工人月报领导的决议》。决议中关于全国总工会对刊物缺乏领导的状况进行了严肃的批评，并提出了纠正的具体办法。这个决议值得各全国性的刊物，尤其是各机关团体的机关刊物注意。自从这个决议以后，《中国工人》已开始有了改善。
    一月份出版的《中国工人》第十二期又发表《我们的检讨》一文，接受本报图书评论第十二号中的批评，表示：“我们除了接受人民日报的批评，并作自我检讨外，今后要负起加强对于工人群众时事教育工作的责任。”
            新出版的财经类期刊
    中央人民政府税务总局在本月一日创刊了它的机关刊物——《中央税务公报》（半月刊）。它刊载的内容是：国家税收政策法令，各税条例、细则的解释例案，一般税务问题之询问与答复，纳税义务人与税工人员的典型事例和其他有关财政税收的论著。创刊号中有《迎接一九五一年》一文具体地指出了一九五一年税收的新任务。
    财经类的另一新刊物是《新会计》，新会计月刊社编辑，北京新潮书店发行，本月二十五日创刊。它是以传达政府会计法令、制度、章则，研讨会计专门问题及介绍苏联会计经验为主要任务。
    中央人民政府贸易部为提高全国贸易工作干部的业务水平，在本月五日创刊了《业务学习》（小型半月刊），内容主要是：疑难问题的解答，合理化建议和典型经验介绍。为了适合该刊的性质，刊名如果改称《贸易业务学习》是更好的。
            其他新出版期刊
    去年十二月份和本月份内创刊的期刊，除了已在本刊作了个别报道的以外，据现有的材料，知道还有以下二十种。一、综合时事类：《宣传手册》，华东区出版；《宣传员手册》，西北区出版；《宣传员》，中南区出版；《宣传手册》，天津知识书店出版，以上均为半月刊，还有《南方周报》，广州南方日报编印。二、工农读物类：《工人之家》半月刊，东北工人出版社出版；《河北农村》半月刊，河北省人民出版社出版。三、文教类：《文通教讯》半月刊，河南文教出版社出版；《重庆教育》月刊，重庆教育社出版。四、财经类：《重庆工商》月刊，《天津工商》月刊。五、文艺类：《察哈尔文艺》月刊；《川西文艺》月刊；《文艺战线》月刊，华东军区、第三野战军政治部编印。六、科技类：《外科学报》月刊，南京华东医药图书出版社出版；《华东卫生》月刊和《医务生活》双月刊，华东医务生活社出版。七、青年类：《新青年报》周刊，青年团中南工委机关报。八、少年儿童类：《重庆少年儿童》，重庆少年儿童社出版。九、画报类：《华南画报》，华南文联出版；《时事画报》三日刊，上海时事画报社出版。
            期刊发展着爱国主义的宣传
    在最近出版的一些期刊中，显露了一个很好的发展趋向——把爱国主义的宣传提到日程上来了。《中国青年》五十六期发表了《新中国与新爱国主义》、《关于爱国主义的几个问题》、《学习列宁的爱国主义榜样》等论文，对爱国主义作了正确的说明和号召。《人民教育》第二卷二、三期，连续发表介绍苏联的爱国主义教育的文章。《新中华》十四卷二期也发表了《新爱国主义的几个基本问题》和《论鲁迅的爱国主义》等两篇论文。《中国轻工业》一卷四期、《天津工商》创刊号和哈尔滨《工商周报》一○七期都报道了工商界的爱国公约运动。《科学通报》一卷八期刊载了《科学界抗美援朝保家卫国的座谈会》，反映了科学工作者爱国主义的热情。关于女工的时事爱国主义教育和爱国竞赛，关于家庭妇女的爱国运动，《新中国妇女》十八期和《现代妇女》二卷一期都进行了宣传和报道。《中国工人》十二期开始加强了对于工人群众时事教育。上海出版的《生产与技术》出了爱国主义生产竞赛的特辑（五卷十二期）；东北的《工人之家》号召坚持爱国主义生产竞赛的经常性，防止突击偏向。环绕着“爱我们的祖国”这一口号，“展望”七卷二期辟了《爱我们的祖国》一栏；《北京工人》五期《我们的祖国真伟大》一文用文字和图画启发了爱祖国的思想与感情；《中国少年儿童》的一篇《东北真可爱》对儿童们很好地勾划出可爱的东北的面貌。《开明少年》六十五期有一篇《东南西北》就地理位置说明了祖国的广大。
