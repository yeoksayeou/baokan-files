Year-End Entertainment Should Meet the Needs of the Masses
   The forced opera performances and wasteful eating and drinking by cadres in Leitou Village, Ji County, should be carefully investigated and dealt with.
   To the Editor:
    Our village is a large village with six to seven hundred households. The village cadres not only failed to effectively lead the masses in winter production but also took the lead in staging operas and indulging in wasteful eating and drinking. On the first of this month, a few village cadres decided to spend 8.5 million yuan to hire an opera troupe, which performed for six consecutive days. Every household in the village had to entertain relatives and friends, spending no less than 100,000 yuan per household. The 600-700 households in the village wasted 60-70 million yuan, which is almost equivalent to paying public grain once. What is particularly infuriating is that Zheng Fushi, the district cadre and concurrently the Communist Party branch secretary of this village, and other village cadres engaged in private networking, eating and drinking extravagantly. In six days, they consumed more than 2,700 catties of steamed buns alone. All the villagers in our village knew that staging operas was extravagant and wasteful, and that the masses were suffering, but they dared not express their opposition because Zheng Fushi's style of work was undemocratic.
    Our villagers all believe that at a time when we are resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and all localities are stepping up production and practicing thrift, the cadres of our village are daydreaming and ignoring the suffering of the people, engaging in extravagance and waste. Therefore, we suggest that the county and district leaders conduct a serious investigation and severely deal with the egregious behavior of the village cadres led by Zheng Fushi.
                 On behalf of all the villagers of Leitou Village, Second District, Ji County, Correspondent Fan Weijun
    (Editor's Note: The situation reported by all the villagers of Leitou Village, Second District, Ji County, is very important. We fully agree with the demands of the masses and believe that this kind of egregious cadre behavior should be carefully investigated and dealt with. At the same time, we suggest that local county and district governments also pay attention to this issue and respect the opinions and demands of the broad masses in year-end entertainment, and oppose coercive practices.)

　　年关娱乐应适应群众需要
   冀县垒头村干部强迫唱大戏及吃喝浪 费现象，应认真检查处理。编辑同志：
    俺村是个六七百户的大村庄。村干部不仅没有很好的领导群众进行冬季生产，却领头唱大戏，吃喝浪费。本月一日，少数村干部作主花费八百五十万元聘来大戏一台，一连唱了六天。全村家家户户都要招待亲朋，每户不下十几万元的花消，全村六、七百户就浪费六、七千万元，这个数目差不多等于交一次公粮。特别令人气愤的，是区干部兼本村中共支书郑福石和其他村干部进行私人拉拢，大吃大唱，六天工夫，光馒头就吃了两千七百多斤。俺们全村群众明知唱大戏是铺张浪费，群众吃亏，但不敢发表反对意见，原因是郑福石作风不民主。
    我们村民都认为当前正在抗美援朝保家卫国的时候，各地均在加紧生产，厉行节约。俺村干部却异想天开，不顾人民痛苦，铺张浪费。因此我们建议，县区领导上对以郑福石为首的村干部此种恶劣作风，应进行认真的检查和严正的处理。

    （编者按：冀县二区垒头村全体村民反映的这个情况很重要。我们完全同意群众的要求，应对此种恶劣的干部作风进行认真的检查和处理。同时建议各地县区政府亦应重视这个问题，在年关娱乐中应尊重广大群众的意见和要求，反对强迫作风。）
