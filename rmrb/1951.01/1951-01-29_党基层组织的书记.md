　　Secretary of the Party's Grassroots Organization

    Editor's Note: This article, "Secretary of the Party's Grassroots Organization," from Pravda illustrates the important role of branch secretaries in Party work. To improve the level of Party work and make Party organizations truly active implementers of Party policies, it is essential to pay close attention to improving the quality of branch secretaries politically and ideologically, and to train them in the art of Bolshevik leadership. Some of the methods mentioned in this article can be used for reference in various regions.

    Party grassroots organizations are the foundation of our Party. They link the masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals with the Party's leading organs. Here, Communists are tempered through Bolshevik education and participate in the Party's great struggle for the victory of Communism.

    Party grassroots organizations should actively participate in the country's political and economic life, carry out propaganda work among the masses, mobilize the working people to complete production plans, and launch socialist emulation drives. Their most important task is to support the new, advanced, and progressive; to resolutely fight against conservatism and stagnation; and to wage determined struggle against waste in enterprises, state farms, and collective farms, and to constantly concern themselves with improving the cultural living conditions of workers, staff, and collective farm members.

    In the struggle to realize the tasks of Communist construction, Party grassroots organizations are constantly enriching themselves with their experience in organizing and political work among the masses. In industrial enterprises, state farms, collective farms, agricultural machinery stations, offices, and schools – everywhere – Party grassroots organizations are active guides to the policies of the Bolshevik Party. Recently, as our country prepared for the local Soviet elections of working people's representatives, Party grassroots organizations carried out enormous propaganda and mobilization work. Millions of Communists worked as propagandists, mobilizing the Soviet people to fight for a new upsurge in our motherland's economy and culture.

    In every province and district, there are many grassroots organizations that have victoriously solved their current tasks. The Party organization of the second oilfield of the "October Oil" Trust in Grozny Province provides a clear example of focused work. With the active participation of the Party organization, the field achieved significant success in completing its production plan, becoming an enterprise of collective Stakhanovite labor. The Party grassroots organization of the field (its secretary being Khalanov) is good at combining political work with economic work. The Party members here are all in decisive positions in production and are leading all personnel. They constantly educate workers and engineers with a spirit of creativity towards labor and a pursuit of innovation. Every Party member actively participates in Party life.

    Rural Party organizations are actively fighting for a further upsurge in socialist agriculture. In this regard, the experience of the advanced collective farm "Light of the East" in Kazakhstan is most instructive. There are one hundred Communists in the collective farm's Party organization. This is a huge force that actively influences the life of the labor collective. The Party grassroots organization and its secretary, Comrade Skolokhod, have shown great concern for the communist education of collective farm members and for the overall development of the labor collective's public economy. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the collective farm has achieved great success. This year, the average harvest of grain crops reached one hundred poods per hectare, the number of livestock has increased significantly, and the labor collective has fulfilled its obligations to the state ahead of schedule.

    There are many such examples. They convincingly demonstrate the growing role of Party grassroots organizations in the political and economic life of the country. The current task is to further improve the working level of Party grassroots organizations. An important condition for successfully solving this task is to devote all efforts to improving the work of lower-level Party cadres – the secretaries of Party grassroots organizations.

    Party cadres, Comrade Stalin taught, are the decisive force for leadership by the Party and the government. Our Party, following this instruction, has carried out enormous cadre education work. The secretaries of Party grassroots organizations are the most numerous contingent of Party workers. The level of work of grassroots organizations largely depends on the political maturity of the grassroots organization secretary, on his ability to lead and educate people. He should have a broad vision, be principled in his work, and treat things from the Party's standpoint. He should be good at organizing Party members and non-Party masses to realize the resolutions of the Party and the government, support initiative, irreconcilably treat shortcomings in work, and set an example in carrying out Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism.

    Local Party organs, while paying attention to the Party's political issues, have begun to pay more attention to the education of lower-level Party cadres. Great help is given to improving the ideological and theoretical level of grassroots organization secretaries and their ability to handle matters. They study in district Party schools, Marxist-Leninist universities, research societies, or groups, and independently delve into Marxist-Leninist theory.

    In order to conduct Party training, Party cultivation, and to familiarize Party members with the good experiences of Party political work, short-term training courses for collective farm Party organization secretaries are now held in many provincial committees, border region committees, and central committees of the Union Republics.

    The training courses study Party organizational work and propaganda and mobilization work issues, and the domestic and international situation of the Soviet Union. The study and summarization of the work experience of Party organizations occupies an important position in the syllabus. Many Party municipal committees and district committees systematically hold research societies for Party grassroots organization secretaries.

    However, not all Party committees give due attention to the political improvement of grassroots organization secretaries and their training in the art of Bolshevik leadership. Individual district committees and municipal committees replace the patient work of training and educating Party cadres with administrative methods. For example, similar incorrect practices are widely prevalent in many districts of the Kabarda Autonomous Republic. As a result, the Kubinsky District replaced more than half of the secretaries of Party grassroots organizations in the four months of this year. The secretary of the Party organization of the Frunze Collective Farm received five disciplinary actions from the Party District Committee this year. On one occasion, the District Committee announced two disciplinary actions against this secretary at one meeting. In the Baksan District, Lesken District, and Ulozhon District of the Bakarda Autonomous Republic, most of the Party grassroots organization secretaries have received Party disciplinary actions.

    Some Party organs have forgotten that the education of cadres requires enormous hard work. Experienced and knowledgeable workers do not fall from the sky. Comrade Stalin taught that it is necessary to cultivate cadres with care, help improve every worker, and not spare time to patiently care for them and accelerate their improvement.

    Instructions, the lively connection between the Party committee and the grassroots organizations, and practical assistance on the ground are important methods of educating lower-level Party workers. However, in reality, some Party municipal committees and district committees still have bureaucratic leadership methods towards grassroots organizations. In this regard, the Kupidi Municipal Committee of Kalinin Province should be particularly mentioned. The workers of the Municipal Committee replaced the lively leadership of grassroots organizations with constant inspections and telephone conversations. The Municipal Committee did not notice that Party political work had been relaxed in many enterprises in the city.

    The exchange of Party experience is of great significance. The grassroots organization secretaries' research societies held by the Party district committees and municipal committees should promote this work. It must be admitted that some places have reduced the significance of the research societies, making them little different from transactional meetings.

    Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism are effective methods of educating Party cadres. The task of the Party Committee is to educate the grassroots organization secretaries with a high degree of rigorous spirit. The Party district committees and municipal committees should enable the grassroots organization secretaries to show more of their own initiative and be good at using the help given to them by the Party.

    By arming grassroots organization secretary cadres with Marxist-Leninist theory, tempering them in practical work, and educating them in the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, Party organizations will be able to further improve the level of Party political work and thereby victoriously solve the tasks of Communist construction.

### 党基层组织的书记

　　党基层组织的书记
    锦成
    编者按：真理报这篇《党基层组织的书记》文章说明了支部书记在党工作中的重要作用。为了提高党的工作水平，使党的组织真正成为党的政策的积极执行者，必须十分注意从政治上思想上提高支部书记的质量，并训练他们以布尔什维克的领导艺术。本文所提的一些办法可供各地参考。
    党的基层组织是我们党的基础。它们把工人、农民和知识分子群众同党的领导机关联系起来。共产党员们在这里经过布尔什维主义教育的锻炼，参与党为争取共产主义胜利的伟大斗争。
    党的基层组织应积极参加国家的政治和经济生活，在群众中进行鼓动工作，动员劳动人民完成生产计划，开展社会主义竞赛。它们的最重要的任务——是支持新的、先进的和进步的，同保守与停滞，同企业、国营农庄和集体农场中的浪费进行坚决的斗争，经常关心工人、职员、集体农庄庄员的文化生活条件的改善。
    在为实现共产主义建设任务的斗争中，党的基层组织不断以它在群众中的组织与政治工作经验丰富着自己。在工业企业中，在国营农庄、集体农场、农业机器站中，在机关与学校中，——在各处，党的基层组织都是布尔什维克党政策的积极指导者。近日来，当我们国家正准备劳动人民代表地方苏维埃选举的时候，党的基层组织进行了巨大的宣传鼓动工作。成百万共产党员作了鼓动员，动员苏联人民为我们祖国经济与文化的新高涨而进行斗争。
    在每省、每区都有不少的基层组织胜利地解决了它们当前的任务。格罗兹内省“十月石油”托拉斯第二场的党组织提供了工作中目标明确的范例。在党组织积极参加下，该场在完成生产计划中获得显著的成功，成为集体斯达哈诺夫劳动的企业。该场党的基层组织（它的书记是哈尔兰诺夫）善于把政治工作和经济工作结合起来。这里的党员们都在生产的决定性的岗位上，并带领着所有人员。他们经常以创造性地对待劳动、追求革新的精神教育工人和工程技术人员。每个党员都实际地参加了党内生活。
    农村党组织为社会主义农业进一步的高涨而积极斗争。在这一方面，卡查赫斯坦先进的集体农庄“东方之光”党组织的经验是最有教益的。在集体农庄党组织中有一百个共产党员。这是积极影响劳动组合生活的一支巨大的力量。党的基层组织及其书记斯可洛霍德同志对于集体农庄庄员的共产主义教育，对于劳动组合公共经济的全面发展表现了极大的关怀。在党组织的领导下，集体农庄获得了巨大的成就。今年谷类作物的平均收获量每公顷达一百普特，牲畜头数显著增多，劳动组合提前完成了它对国家的义务。
    这样的例子很多。它们具有说服力地证明了党的基层组织在国家政治经济生活中日益增长的作用。目前的任务在于更进一步地提高党的基层组织的工作水平。胜利解决这个任务的重要条件是全力改进对下层党干部——党的基层组织书记的工作。
    党的干部，斯大林同志教导说，是党和政府进行领导的决定力量。我们党遵循着这个指示，进行了巨大的干部教育工作。党的基层组织书记是党的工作者中人数最众多的队伍。基层组织的工作水平大大地有赖于基层组织书记的政治成熟性，有赖于他领导和教育人们的能力。他应当具有广阔的见地，工作中的原则性，和以党的立场对待事物，应当善于组织党员和非党群众去实现党和政府的决议，支持主动性，不调和地对待工作中的缺点，并以身作则地开展布尔什维克的批评与自我批评。
    地方党机关在注意到党的政治问题时，开始更为关心对下层党干部的教育。对提高基层组织书记的思想理论水平和处理事物的能力给以很大的帮助。他们在区的党校、马列主义大学、研究会或小组中学习，独立地钻研马列主义理论。
    为了进行党的训练、党的培养、并使党员熟悉党的政治工作的好经验，现在在许多省委会、边区委员会和加盟共和国党中央委员会中都举办了集体农庄党组织书记的短期训练班。
    在训练班内研究党的组织工作和宣传鼓动工作问题和苏联国内外局势问题。研究和总结党组织的工作经验在教学大纲中占着重要的地位，许多党的市委会和区委会有系统地举办了党基层组织书记的研究会。
    然而，并不是所有党的委员会对于基层组织书记的政治上的提高，以及他们的布尔什维克领导艺术的训练，都给予了应有的注意。个别区委会和市委会以行政方式代替了训练和教育党的干部的耐心的工作。例如，类似的不正确的作法广泛地普遍地存在于卡尔巴达自治共和国的许多区内。因之，库宾斯基区于今年的四个月之中便更换了一半以上的党基层组织的书记。伏龙芝集体农庄党组织的书记今年受到党区委会的五次处分。曾有一次区委会在一次会议上便宣布了对这个书记的两个处分。在巴卡尔达自治共和国的巴克山区、列士肯区和乌洛若宁区，大部分党基层组织的书记都受有党的处分。
    一些党的机关忘记了对干部的教育需要巨大的艰苦的工作，有经验的熟悉业务的工作者不是从天上掉下来的。斯大林同志教导说，必须关心地培养干部，帮助提高每个工作者，不吝惜时间去耐心地关怀他们，加速提高他们。
    指示、党委会和基层组织的生动的联系以及实地的实际帮助，是教育下层党工作人员的重要方法。然而，实际上，有些党的市委会和区委会对基层组织还有着官僚主义的领导方法。在这一方面，特别应提出卡列宾省的库皮底市委会。市委会的工作者以满天飞的巡视和用电话谈话代替了对基层组织的生动的领导。市委会没有注意到，在该市的许多企业中放松了党的政治工作。
    交流党的经验有着重大的意义。党的区委会和市委会所办的基层组织书记研究会应当促进这件工作。必须承认，有些地方降低了研究会的意义，他们使它同事务性的会议很少区别。
    布尔什维克的批评与自我批评是教育党的干部的有效方法。党委会的任务是以高度的有着严格要求的精神教育基层组织书记。党的区委会和市委会应当使基层组织书记更多地表现自己的主动性，并善于运用党给予他们的帮助。
    以马列主义理论武装基层组织书记干部，在实际工作中锻炼他们，以布尔什维克的批评与自我批评的精神教育他们，党组织便能更进一步提高党的政治工作水平，并由此而胜利地解决共产主义建设的任务。
