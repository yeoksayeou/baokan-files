　　Three Questions Regarding Stamp Duty and Invoices
　　Question: I am a farmer. Should I also affix stamp duty when selling some of my own produce?
　　Xu Min
　　Answer: Generally, any transaction should be subject to stamp duty according to law. However, to accommodate farmers, it has been stipulated that farmers are exempt from stamp duty when selling their own produce. If sold through a brokerage, the brokerage should deduct and affix the stamp duty on their behalf.
　　Question: Since the implementation of invoices, we have found it very troublesome. Can it be implemented only for large quantities of goods, and exempted for small quantities of goods?
　　Shi Qian
　　Answer: An invoice is a certificate issued with the goods after a transaction. If the buyer is an organization, group, or industrial or commercial household, the invoice will naturally be used as the original voucher for accounting. Even ordinary citizens need to keep it for reference. If there is an error in the type, quantity, or price of the goods, the invoice can be used as a basis for verification. Therefore, regardless of the amount of the sale, a unified invoice should be issued. Recently, in order to save the cost of invoices, Beijing has printed small-sized Type B unified invoices, which are much cheaper than the ones currently in use and will be available for sale soon. Industrial and commercial households can contact the tax bureau to purchase them.
　　Question: I am a small landlord with more than fifty rooms, rented to more than thirty households, with different rents for each room. I use a separate rent book for each household. Every year, I always buy stamps to affix, but I don't know how much I should affix? Ma Deqing
　　Answer: According to Article 24 of the current Stamp Duty Law, lease contracts or agreements should be affixed with stamp duty by the lessor at a rate of 0.3% of the amount stated. If no separate contract or agreement is made, but the various conditions and rent amount are recorded in the rent book instead of a contract, stamp duty should also be affixed at this rate. When collecting rent on a regular basis, a separate receipt should be issued and affixed with stamp duty at a rate of 0.3%. If no separate rent receipt is issued, and the rent collected is recorded in the rent book, stamp duty should be affixed each time the rent is collected at a rate of 0.3% of the rent. Rent less than 15,000 yuan is exempt from stamp duty.

　　关于印花和发票的三个问题
    问：我是一个农民，出卖一些自产品是否也应立据贴印花？
   徐民
    答：一般发生交易行为，依法均应立据贴花。但为照顾农民计，已规定农民销售自产品时，可以免贴。如果通过行栈代卖者，则应由行栈代扣代贴。
    问：发货票实行以来，我们感到很麻烦，是否可以只对大宗货物实行，少量的货物就可以免除？
   史千
    答：发货票是买卖货物成交后随货开立的凭证，买货人如为机关、团体或工商业户，发货票自然要作为记账的原始凭证。即使是一般市民，也需要存留查考；如遇货品种类、数量或价款发生错误，即可凭发货票作为查对的根据。所以售货无论数额大小，都是一样应当开立统一发货票的。京市近来为了节省发货票的工本费已加印小型的乙种统一发货票，价格比现在使用的已减省了很多，不久即可出售，各工商业户可向税务分局洽购。
    问：我是一个小房主，有五十余间房，租了三十多户，每间房租价不等。所用的租摺每户一个，每到年终，我总是买印花贴，但是不知应该贴多少？ 马德清
    答：租赁契约或合同依现行印花税法第二十四目，应由出租人按所载金额万分之三贴花。如不另立契约或合同而把各项条件和租金额记于租摺内代替契约使用者，也应按此例贴花。以后按期收取租金时应另开收据按千分之三贴花，如不另开租金收据，而将所收租金记载租摺内，应于每次收租时按租金千分之三粘贴印花，租金不满一万五千元者免贴。
