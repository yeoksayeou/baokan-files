　　The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
    Extends New Year Greetings to the People's Army and People Across the Country
    And Sends a Telegram to the People's Volunteer Army to Express Respect and Condolences
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 31st] The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today sent a New Year's congratulatory telegram to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and compatriots across the country. The telegram reads:
    Comrades Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Compatriots across the Country:
    As the New Year of 1951 approaches, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, on behalf of all democratic parties and people's organizations across the country, extends warm congratulations to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and compatriots of all ethnic groups and sectors across the country.
    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central People's Government, and with the diligent efforts of the army and people across the country, China achieved leapfrog progress in military, political, diplomatic, economic, and cultural fields in 1950, and showed a prosperous and thriving atmosphere in all aspects. We eliminated the remaining enemies along the coast, began to heal the wounds of war, achieved an initial improvement in the financial and economic situation, and restored various production and cultural and educational undertakings. We formed a solid alliance of friendship with the Soviet Union, extensively united all international friends, and at the same time waged a victorious struggle against imperialist aggression.
    Due to the aggression of US imperialism against our territory of Taiwan and our neighboring country of Korea, the people across the country launched a vigorous movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to aid Korea, assisting the Korean People's Army in crushing the attacks of the US aggressors, safeguarding the security of the motherland, upholding human justice, and defending world peace. Our People's Republic of China has become a powerful country that is warmly respected by the people all over the world.
    In 1951, the new and glorious tasks before the people of our country are to continue to strengthen national defense and support the just struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, actively develop land reform, consolidate finance and economy, restore industrial and agricultural production with emphasis, and strengthen anti-imperialist and patriotic education on the cultural and ideological front. We believe that the army and people across the country will work together to strive to achieve these tasks and achieve greater results than in 1950.
    Long live the great unity of the people of the whole country!
    Long live our great motherland!
                          The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
                              December 31, 1950
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 31st] The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to celebrate the New Year. The telegram reads: To all Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country:
    As the New Year of 1951 approaches, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, on behalf of all democratic parties, people's organizations, and people of all ethnic groups and sectors across the country, warmly congratulates you—the most glorious patriotic soldiers—on the New Year, and extends our highest respect and cordial condolences.
    Regardless of all hardships and difficulties, you have bravely fought side by side with the Korean People's Army and achieved a great victory, crushing the attacks of the US aggressors, destroying the US imperialists' dream of conquering Korea, further invading China, and dominating the world, causing great chaos in the imperialist camp and changing the international situation. Your brilliant victory has not only ensured the security of the motherland, but also upheld human justice, defended world peace, and added infinite glory to the new People's Republic of China. The people of the whole of China and the whole world are excited and encouraged by your victory, and greatly strengthened their victorious belief in resisting aggression and defending independence and freedom. The people across the country are determined to support you with all their strength, and hope that you will strive for greater victories in order to promote a just final solution to the Korean issue.
    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Eternal glory to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country!
                            The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
                                December 31, 1950

　　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会
    向全国军民祝贺新年
    并驰电人民志愿军致敬慰问
    【新华社三十一日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会今日向中国人民解放军全体指战员与全国同胞发出新年贺电，电文如下：中国人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们，全国同胞们：
    当一九五一年的新年来临之际，中国人民政协全国委员会谨代表全国各民主党派、各人民团体向人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员和全国各民族各界同胞致热烈的祝贺。
    在毛泽东主席和中央人民政府的英明领导和全国军民同胞的勤奋努力下，我国在一九五○年无论军事、政治、外交、经济、文化都获得了飞跃的进展，各方面都显现兴旺发达的气象。我们肃清了沿海残敌，开始医治了战争的创伤，取得了财政经济状况的初步好转，恢复了各项生产事业和文化教育事业。我们与苏联结成了巩固的友好同盟，广泛地团结了一切国际友人，同时向帝国主义侵略势力进行了胜利的斗争。
    由于美国帝国主义侵略我国的领土台湾和我国的邻邦朝鲜，全国人民开展了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并组成人民志愿军驰援朝鲜，协助朝鲜人民军，粉碎了美国侵略者的进攻，保障了祖国的安全，伸张了人类的正义，捍卫了世界和平。我们中华人民共和国已经成为全世界人民所热烈尊敬的强大的国家。
    在一九五一年，摆在我国人民面前的新的光荣任务，是继续加强国防力量，和支援中国人民志愿军的正义斗争；巩固人民民主专政，积极发展土地改革工作，巩固财政经济，有重点地恢复工农业生产，加强文化思想战线上的反帝国主义的和爱国主义的教育工作。我们相信，全国军民一定会同心协力，为实现这些任务而奋斗，并获得比一九五○年更大的成绩。
    全国人民大团结万岁！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
                          中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会
                              一九五○年十二月三十一日
    【新华社三十一日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会今日驰电中国人民志愿军祝贺新年。电文如下：中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国志愿军的全体同志们：
    当一九五一年的新年来临之际，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会谨代表全国各民主党派、各人民团体和各民族各界人民热烈地向你们——最光荣的爱国战士祝贺新年，并致崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。
    你们不顾一切艰难困苦，英勇地和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，取得了伟大的胜利，粉碎了美国侵略者的进攻，破坏了美帝国主义征服朝鲜、进一步侵略中国和独霸世界的迷梦，使帝国主义阵营发生极大的混乱，使国际局势为之改观。你们的这个光辉胜利，不但保障了祖国的安全，而且伸张了人类正义，捍卫了世界和平，为新生的人民祖国增加了无限的光荣。全中国全世界的人民都为你们的胜利而兴奋鼓舞，而极大地增强反抗侵略、保卫独立自由的胜利信念。全国人民决心以全力支援你们，希望你们争取更大的胜利，以便促成朝鲜问题的合乎正义的最后解决。
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    为抗美援朝保家卫国而英勇牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
                            中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会
                                一九五○年十二月三十一日
