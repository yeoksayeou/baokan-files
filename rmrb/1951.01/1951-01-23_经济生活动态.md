　　Economic Life Dynamics
　　Jiangnan Paper Mill Successfully Makes Bleached Bamboo Pulp
　　The technical team of Shanghai Jiangnan Paper Mill, including comrades Yu Kunrong and labor model Ji Haoran, overcame the difficulties in raw materials for papermaking. After more than three months of research and experimentation, they finally produced bamboo pulp that can be used to make bleached paper. Moreover, the quality is high, and the use of auxiliary materials during manufacturing can be reduced, lowering the cost by 30%. In addition, the factory's output in December last year exceeded the highest record in the past 25 years by 15%.
　　Zhongnan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Strictly Enforces Financial Discipline
　　Since the Zhongnan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company implemented cash management in March last year, only one-third of the approved amount has been kept in the treasury as petty cash, and all transactions with public organizations have been made using transfer checks. Due to the strict implementation of the cash management system, the company has recovered more than 1,400 billion yuan in cash in the past year (excluding transfer allocations). Strict adherence to national financial discipline by state-owned enterprises plays a significant role in the implementation of the national financial plan.
　　Yunnan Zhaotong Transportation Team Revitalizes Material Exchange
　　In October of last year, the Zhaotong Trading Company in Yunnan mobilized a large number of farmers to organize a material transportation team, which has fundamentally changed the phenomenon of accumulated local products due to inconvenient transportation over the years. As a result, industry and commerce in Zhaotong have gradually recovered, with the number of mountain goods stores increasing from four to twenty-four. Large quantities of local products such as tung oil and medicinal materials have been transported to neighboring provinces such as Sichuan, and necessities such as cotton yarn, salt, and paper have been exchanged. The transportation team has now grown to 3,632 people, organized into squadrons, detachments, teams, and groups, with good order and discipline. The transportation team travels a difficult thousand-mile road from Zhaotong to Yibin in Sichuan, climbing mountains and crossing ridges. Thanks to them, the exchange of materials inside and outside the province has gradually become active.
　　Tangshan Coal and Building Materials Company Achieves Success in Coal Management
　　Over the past year, the Tangshan Coal and Building Materials Company has vigorously managed coal, supporting local kiln industries and cooperatives. When the city's kiln industry faced sluggish sales due to the financial difficulties of various factories and their inability to purchase coal, the company adopted a method of providing coal on credit, enabling all 52 kiln factories to resume operations. When the company promoted the sale of accumulated coal from the private Kailuan Mine, it gave cooperatives preferential treatment of 3% to 6%, helping the development of local cooperative businesses. In addition, the company purchased coal tickets issued to mine workers, cracking down on speculators' price-gouging and protecting the interests of workers.
　　Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Sets Eight New Records in Seven Days
　　After the production tasks for 1951 were assigned, all employees of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant wrote to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to overfulfill the tasks. The steelmaking department of the plant created eight new records in a row from January 1st to 7th. The time for one furnace of steelmaking was reduced from a new record of five hours and fifty-three minutes to a new record of four hours and fifty-four minutes. This record is already close to the world's steelmaking standards.
　　Baoji Locomotive Depot's Liu Ruiqing Crew Has No Accidents in Eight Months
　　The eight-member crew of Liu Ruiqing of the Baoji Locomotive Depot of the Xi'an Railway Bureau overcame numerous difficulties and created a new record of completely safe shunting operations and 50,957 kilometers of safe travel without accidents in the past year. In terms of shunting records, they also set a new record of completing the disassembly and grouping of 201 vehicles and 217 hooks in twelve hours and forty minutes (previously 150 hooks).
