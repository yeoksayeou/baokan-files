　　Ding County Special District Flower, Yarn, Cloth and Other Specialized Companies Adopt Chain Operations to Exchange Industrial and Agricultural Products
　　[Our Newspaper News] Grain, department store, oil, coal, iron, salt and other specialized companies in Ding County Special District, combined with the flower, yarn and cloth companies, launched a chain exchange business to exchange industrial and agricultural products, providing a large number of necessities such as grain, cloth, coal, and salt in exchange for farmers' cotton, thereby invigorating urban-rural relations and safeguarding the legitimate interests of cotton farmers. Farmers enthusiastically took out cotton in exchange for necessities such as grain. According to statistics on December 18 last year, in Yangjiaying Village alone, 906.2 jin of cotton were exchanged in one day; the grain company exchanged 545.5 jin of grain in one market.
　　In carrying out this business, the first step was to widely publicize it. The method was to combine the government's notices and instructions to publicize the significance of the exchange, and to carry out publicity level by level from top to bottom through cooperatives. In addition, leaflets were distributed or people were directly used to broadcast. After publicity, the farmers knew the benefits of the exchange to them. For example, on December 27 last year, cadres carried out exchange publicity in the Li County market. After farmers attending the market learned the spirit and methods of the exchange, they reflected, "This method should have been implemented long ago in our cotton-producing area." Farmers also felt it was convenient for various companies to use grain, cloth, salt, coal, etc. for exchange.
　　The steps for carrying out the chain exchange business were as follows: the flower, yarn and cloth company took the lead, signing contracts with various specialized companies. Before each exchange began, the specialized companies (grain, oil, salt, coal, iron, department store, etc.) reported the prices of various materials to the flower, yarn and cloth company, which uniformly listed the prices of various materials in the market, so that farmers knew the exchange rate between cotton and other items; in the specific exchange, farmers first handed over the cotton to the flower, yarn and cloth company, and went to whatever company they needed items from with a slip of paper issued by the flower, yarn and cloth company, and each company paid equivalent goods according to the slip, and each company reconciled accounts with the flower, yarn exchange point every night to settle.
　　Ding County Special District is a cotton-producing area. Last year, there was a bumper harvest of cotton. Farmers sold approximately 2,500,000 jin of cotton in exchange for necessary items. Before the flower, yarn and cloth company adopted the chain operation, although it had purchased a portion of the cotton, other specialized companies could not follow up with the supply of necessary items, resulting in market supply and demand imbalances in some areas, which made cotton farmers lose confidence in cotton planting. After the exchange work was carried out, it not only solved the difficulties of cotton farmers in having cotton that was difficult to sell and not being able to buy necessities after selling cotton, but also strengthened farmers' confidence in cotton planting through factual education.

### 定县专区花纱布等专业公司采用连环业务交换工农产品

　　定县专区花纱布等专业公司采用连环业务交换工农产品
    【本报讯】定县专区粮食、百货、油脂、煤铁、盐业等专业公司，结合花纱布公司展开了换购连环业务，大量地供给粮、布、煤、盐等必需品换购农民的棉花，从而活跃了城乡关系，维护了棉农应得的利益。农民们踊跃地拿出棉花，换回粮食等必需品。据去年十二月十八日统计，一天中，只杨家营一个村就换出棉花九百零六斤二两；粮食公司在一个集市上换出粮食五百四十五斤半。
    在进行这一业务中，首先是广泛地展开了宣传，方法是结合政府的通知，指示宣传换购意义，和通过合作社自上而下地逐级进行宣传。此外，还采用散放传单或用人直接广播等。经过宣传，农民们知道了换购对他们的好处。如去年十二月二十七日，干部们在里县集进行换购宣传，赶集的农民知道换购的精神和办法后，反映说：“像我们这个棉产区，早应该实行这种办法了。”农民对各公司用粮食、布、盐、煤等进行交换，也感到方便。
    换购连环业务的进行步骤，是以花纱布公司为主，分向各专业公司订立合同，在每次换购开始前，各专业公司（粮食、油脂、盐业、煤铁、百货等）把各种物资牌价报到花纱布公司，由该公司统一把各种物品牌价明列在市场上，使农民知道棉花与其他物品的折合率；在具体进行换购中，农民先把棉花交到花纱布公司，要什么物品就由该处开条子到什么公司去领，各公司依条子付给等价实物，每晚各公司与花纱换购处对账进行清结。
    定县专区，是一个棉产区，去年棉花丰收，农民约有二、五○○余万斤棉花售出，换回必需物品。花纱布公司在采用连环业务以前，虽曾收购过一部分棉花，但在收购中，其他各专业公司不能跟随供应必需物品，以致形成局部地区的市场供求失常，使棉农对于植棉失去信心。在换购工作开展后，不仅解决了棉农有棉不易推销和卖了棉花买不到必需品的困难，同时通过事实的教育，坚定了农民植棉的信心。
