　　Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The rapid collapse of the invading American army's "new defense line" and the swift liberation of Seoul once again prove the strength and invincibility of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. Although MacArthur ordered news censorship, "strictly blocking" all news about the American army's defeat, the telegrams of reactionary news agencies of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, which had been inspected and censored, still revealed the disastrous defeat of the American aggressors.

　　The Associated Press admitted that the American Eighth Army, which had retreated from north of the Cheongcheon River all the way to south of the 38th parallel, "had almost a whole month to prepare for defense." They "intended to hold" Seoul and southern Korea, and "they were well prepared." In the Seoul area alone, they concentrated at least three American divisions (the 24th Division, the 25th Division, and the 1st Cavalry Division) and one British brigade, in addition to the Syngman Rhee puppet army. American broadcast commentator Pearson quoted Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley's boast on December 31st, saying that the American army "has sufficient troops in Korea...and ten times the firepower of the Chinese army" (referring to the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting alongside the Korean People's Army). The Associated Press said that the American army "had dug very good fortifications," and "the front of the line was covered with barbed wire and minefields, and the defending teams had dug trenches and had carefully arranged positions." At the same time, the American Air Force also made "desperate efforts" "despite wind, snow, and clouds," using the so-called new weapon "F-80 Lightning jet fighters, dispatching 1,100 sorties in the overall air offensive of the first and second days." On the sea off Incheon Port, 20 miles west of Seoul, ships from the United States and its satellite countries Britain, France, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Thailand, and New Zealand were concentrated to "protect the western flank of the 'United Nations Forces,' making most of the area south and west of the 'United Nations Forces' within range of naval guns." After the offensive of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces was launched, Ridgway, who succeeded Walker as commander of the American Eighth Army, immediately rushed to "personally supervise the front line," attempting to force American soldiers to resist desperately.

　　However, no weapons or resistance of the American aggressors could stop the powerful offensive of the heroic and resourceful Chinese and Korean People's fighters fighting for justice, nor could they save the collapse of the entire front of the American invading army. The official spokesman of the American Eighth Army admitted that the Chinese and Korean People's Forces disregarded the concentrated artillery and huge air power of the United Nations Forces. "We (the American army) have a very large number of fighter-bombers and jet aircraft and fierce artillery fire bombarding the rapidly advancing enemy...But well-trained troops with submachine guns and grenades still surged forward endlessly." "Not even a volcanic eruption could stop them." At the same time, the war art and resourcefulness of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces also greatly offset the role of the American Air Force. The war news released by MacArthur Headquarters on the 1st had to admit that although the American Air Force had caused some supply difficulties for the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, they "had solved the major supply problems in some clever way," and finally quickly "prepared a major offensive against the United Nations Forces." American Far East Air Force Commander Stratemeyer also admitted on December 31st that "the enemy is deployed in depth, and they use natural barriers or are deeply hidden in trenches and cleverly disguised," so they cannot "become a full-fledged, planned area bombing and sweeping target." The spokesman of the American Eighth Army further admitted that when the Chinese and Korean People's Forces attacked, the flustered American Air Force personnel often "swept (American army) their own troops," forcing the American command center to order a temporary "cessation of all shooting."

　　Under the "most fierce blows" of such heroic and invincible Chinese and Korean People's Forces, those "trembling United Nations soldiers" who had long faced the "tense situation" immediately collapsed across the board. "These United Nations troops have been waiting for this battle in the severe cold for a long time, and it fell on them like a thunderbolt." The United Press and the Associated Press admitted that after the Chinese and Korean People's Forces "launched a powerful offensive," they quickly "tore huge gaps" in the American defense line on the Imjin River, causing an American division "known for its tenacity" to "completely collapse," "seriously threatening the main supply line to the entire front of the American Eighth Army." The American Eighth Army press officer admitted: "On the 150-mile defense line south of the 38th parallel, the entire line is continuing to retreat under heavy pressure."

　　An American International News Service reporter revealed: "In the first blow launched by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, the United Nations troops who bore the brunt suffered heavy casualties." "On one occasion, an entire battalion of the United Nations Forces' most proud division was surrounded, and suffered heavy casualties when breaking out."

　　Reactionary reporters used these words to describe the ugly state of the American army's rout: "Allied troops were made dizzy," "troops of the American Eighth Army retreated in droves," "fleeing south in disgrace." An Agence France-Presse reporter wrote: "Long lines of soldiers returning from the front...were haggard and blackened...They were exhausted from fighting...On the way south, supply depots were burning all along the road." An Associated Press reporter wrote: "Behind the front line, retreating troops always cursed hurriedly, in complete chaos. The long columns of retreating motorcycles and some cars sometimes got stuck in the mud."

　　A United Press reporter asked: "Where exactly will the American army, which is fleeing across the board, establish a defense line and make a possible new resistance?" The spokesman of the American aggressor Eighth Army said dejectedly: "It is inconvenient to speculate."

　　Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The Syngman Rhee puppet government, which had been entrenched in Seoul for three months, fled in panic to Busan on the eve of the liberation of Seoul. According to the United Press and the Associated Press, the approach of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to Seoul caused the remnants of the American and Rhee bandit gangs entrenched in Seoul to be "panic-stricken," and the entire city was "full of rumors," presenting a scene of "chaos." The Syngman Rhee puppet government held three "emergency cabinet meetings" in a row on the 2nd, and finally decided to flee under the instructions of the "American Embassy." The "staying staff of various departments" of the puppet government "packed records, documents, and equipment all night," and fled to Busan on the 3rd.

　　At the same time, the American instrument of aggression against Korea, the "United Nations Commission on Korea," and the staying staff of the American and British embassies also fled in disgrace to Busan.

　　在英勇无敌的中朝人民部队重击下
    侵朝美军再度全线溃逃
    李承晚傀儡政府已仓惶逃往釜山
    【新华社五日讯】侵朝美军“新防线”的迅速崩溃和汉城的迅速解放，再一次证明了中朝人民部队的强大无敌。虽然麦克阿瑟下令实行新闻管制，“严密封锁”一切关于美军失败的消息，但经过检查删削的美英法等国反动通讯社的电讯，仍然透露了美国侵略军惨败的情况。
    美联社承认：从清川江以北一直溃逃到三八线以南的美国第八军，“曾经有过几乎一个整月进行防守的准备”。他们“打算固守”汉城与朝鲜南部，“他们是很有准备的”。仅在汉城地区，他们就至少集结了美军三个师（第二十四师、第二十五师及骑兵第一师）和一个英国旅的兵力，此外还有李承晚伪军。美国广播评论员皮尔逊十二月三十一日转述美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷的吹嘘说：美军“在朝鲜有足够的兵力，……而且火力比中国军队（按指与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的中国人民志愿军）强十倍”。美联社说：美军“已经掘了很良好的工事”，“防线的前面有着铁丝网和布雷地带，而防守的团队又都挖了壕沟，并有小心地布置的阵地”。同时，美国空军也“冒着风雪和云层”作了“拚命的努力”，使用所谓新式武器的“Ｆ八十雷电式喷气飞机，在一、二两日的全面空中攻势中出动了一千一百架次”。在汉城以西二十哩仁川港的海面上，并集中了美国及其仆从国英、法、加、澳、荷、泰、新西兰等国的舰只，“保护‘联合国军’的西翼，使‘联合国军’南面及西面的这个地区的大部分，都在海军巨炮的射程之内”。在中朝人民部队的攻势发动后，继瓦克任美国第八军军长的李奇微，曾立即慌忙“亲在前线督阵”，企图迫使美国士兵拚命顽抗。
    但是，美国侵略者的任何武器和任何顽抗，都无法阻挡为正义而战的英勇而机智的中朝人民战士的强大进攻，也无法挽救美国侵略军全部战线的崩溃。美国第八军正式发言人承认：中朝人民部队蔑视联合国军集中的炮兵和巨大的空军力量。我们（美军）有非常多的战斗轰炸机与喷气式飞机和猛烈的炮火轰击急急前进的敌人。……但是，带着冲锋枪和手榴弹的训练得很好的军队，仍然无穷无尽地向前涌进”。“就是火山爆发，也不能阻止他们”。同时，中朝人民部队的战争艺术与机智，也大大抵消了美国空军的作用。麦克阿瑟总部一日所发布的战事新闻不得不承认：美国空军虽然造成了中朝人民部队一些供应上的困难，但他们“已以某种巧妙方法解决了重大的供应问题”，终于迅速地“准备好了对联合国军发动一次大攻势”。美国远东空军司令斯特拉特梅耶十二月三十一日也承认“敌人是纵深部署的，他们利用天然障体或者深藏在战壕里并巧妙地伪装起来”，因此，无法“成为一个全力的有计划的面积轰炸与扫射的目标。”美军第八军发言人又承认：当中朝人民部队进攻时，手忙脚乱的美国空军人员时常“扫射（美军）自己的部队”，使得美军指挥中心不得不命令暂时“停止一切射击”。
    在如此英勇无敌的中朝人民部队的“最猛烈的打击”下，那些长期面对着“紧张形势”的“战栗的联合国兵士”，立即全线崩溃。“这些联合国部队在严寒中等待这个会战已有很久了，它象霹雳似地落在他们身上。”合众社和美联社承认：中朝人民部队“发动强有力的进攻”后，在临津江美军防线上迅速“撕开了巨大缺口”，使“以顽强著称的”美军一个师“完全崩溃”，“严重地威胁了通往美军第八军全部战线的主要补给线”。美军第八军新闻发布官承认：“在三八线以南的一百五十哩的防线上，全线都在沉重的压力下继续退却。”
    美国国际新闻社记者透露：在中朝人民部队“开始的一击中，首当其冲的联合国军队受到重大的死伤”。“有一次，联合国军最足以自豪的一师整个一营人被包围了，突围而出时死伤惨重”。
    反动记者们描写美军狼狈溃逃的丑态时，用了这些字句：“盟国军队被弄得头昏眼花”，“美军第八军的部队成群结队地退却”，“狼狈南行”。法新社记者写道：“从前线回来的长列的士兵，……面色憔悴而且发黑，……他们已经打得精疲力竭了。……在向南的路上，沿路都是燃烧着的补给品仓库。”美联社记者写道：“在战线后面，撤退的部队总是匆忙地诅咒，乱得一塌糊涂。撤退的长长的摩托车行列，部分汽车有时陷入泥泞”。
    合众社记者问道：全线溃逃的美军“究竟将在何处建立防线、作可能的新的抵抗呢”？美国侵略者第八军发言人黯然地说：“不便推测。”
    【新华社五日讯】三月来盘据汉城的李承晚傀儡政府，在汉城解放前夕，已仓惶逃往釜山。据合众社、美联社透露：朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军逼近汉城时，使盘据汉城的美李匪帮残余分子“仓惶失措”，全城“充满谣言”，呈现一片“混乱”。李承晚傀儡政府在二日一天中接连举行了三次“内阁非常会议”，最后在“美国大使馆”的指示下决定逃跑。傀儡政府“各部的留守人员彻夜包装纪录、文卷和设备”，并在三日逃到釜山。
    同时，美国侵朝工具“联合国朝鲜委员会”及美国大使馆、英国大使馆的留守人员也已狼狈逃往釜山。
