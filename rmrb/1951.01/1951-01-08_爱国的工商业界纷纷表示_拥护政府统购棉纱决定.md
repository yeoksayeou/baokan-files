　　Patriotic Industrial and Commercial Circles Express Support for Government's Decision to Nationally Purchase Cotton Yarn
　　[This newspaper reports] Following the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council Financial and Economic Committee's issuance of the order to implement the "Decision on the National Purchase of Cotton Yarn," the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, and the cotton textile industry and yarn and cloth businesses in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Zhangjiakou and other cities have unanimously expressed their warm support.

　　Spokesperson for the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Speaks
　　The spokesperson for the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement saying:

　　The decision on the national purchase of cotton yarn issued by the Government Administration Council Financial and Economic Committee on the 4th of this month is fully in line with the interests and demands of the people of the whole country. It is the central link in stabilizing general commodity prices at present. All members of our All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce wholeheartedly and warmly support this decision and are willing to work hard to put this decision into practice!

　　This decision is related to our industrialists and businessmen, especially those in the yarn and cloth industry. The government has taken into account the reasonable interests of the yarn and cloth industry in its decisions on purchase prices and processing fees. Our industrialists and businessmen across the country have already demonstrated unprecedented patriotism in resisting America and aiding Korea, and have included slogans such as stabilizing prices and guaranteeing supply in the patriotic covenants launched in various places. Therefore, when the government takes this measure to take care of the needs of the people across the country and stabilize prices, we believe that patriotic industrialists and businessmen across the country will be able to warmly support the government's decision, not to speculate or hoard, and to fully comply with the standards stipulated by the government in the production of yarn and cloth.

　　Textile Workers' Union Committee Decides
　　The National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China passed a resolution on the 6th at an expanded meeting of its Standing Committee to support the "Decision on the National Purchase of Cotton Yarn" issued by the Government Administration Council Financial and Economic Committee. The decision pointed out: The decision on the national purchase of cotton yarn is of great significance for rationally supplying the people's need for clothing and stabilizing prices. The trade union grassroots organizations in all cotton textile factories have the responsibility to supervise the full implementation of this decision in their respective factories; the committees of trade unions in districts, provinces, and cities have the responsibility to supervise the full implementation of this decision in all cotton textile enterprises in their respective districts, provinces, and cities. Trade union committees at all levels should jointly undertake this glorious task with the administrative departments of public enterprises or the capitalists of private enterprises. The decision pointed out: In order to accomplish this glorious task, (1) trade union committees at all levels must immediately and conscientiously study the "Decision on the National Purchase of Cotton Yarn" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee on January 4 and the People's Daily editorial "Why Nationally Purchase Cotton Yarn?" and use various gatherings, newspapers, blackboards, broadcasts, etc. to widely publicize the significance of this decision among textile workers. (2) We must combine patriotic production competitions to further improve production, pay special attention to ensuring that quality does not decline after the state's national purchase of cotton yarn and cloth; and strive for higher yarn and cloth output, better quality, and lower costs. (3) Textile trade union organizations at all levels, especially grassroots organizations, must accurately and promptly grasp the quantity of yarn and cloth production and learn to calculate costs, so as to correctly realize mass supervision.

　　Shanghai Textile Industry Holds Meeting
　　After the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council Financial and Economic Committee announced the "Decision on the National Purchase of Cotton Yarn," the Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Association and private yarn factories, reproduction factories, and yarn and cloth merchants unanimously expressed their warm support. On the 4th, the city's Cotton Textile Industry Association convened a membership meeting, at which everyone unanimously stated, "This decision is a reasonable method that takes care of all aspects and meets current needs. In the future, we in the industry will definitely work hard to cooperate with the government in implementing this decision." Rong Yiren, general manager of Shenxin Textile Company, pointed out: This decision is of great benefit to the cotton textile industry. First, whether it is self-spinning and self-weaving or commissioned spinning and weaving, enterprises can obtain appropriate guarantees; second, the problem of sales can be solved by the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation's overall allocation, allowing us to concentrate our efforts on improving production; third, it can enable us to quickly enter planned production and lay a solid foundation for the new democratic planned economy.

　　The city's reproduction industry also unanimously believes that this decision is correct. Tang Zhiyao, general manager of Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory, said in a statement: Since all cotton yarn is controlled by the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, the supply of raw materials to our reproduction industry has been given an added guarantee; at the same time, rational distribution will lay the foundation for the planned production of cotton textiles.

　　The preparatory committee of the city's yarn and cloth business association also issued statements separately, unanimously supporting this measure. Wu Zhenshan, general manager of Zhenyuan Cotton Cloth Shop, believes that in addition to supporting this decision, we demand that the management of the yarn and cloth market be strengthened, speculation and hoarding be banned, and that we wholeheartedly cooperate with the distribution and sales of state-owned trading companies and work hard for the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

　　Hangzhou and Wuxi Textile Industry Expresses Opinions
　　Lu Si'an, deputy manager of the First Yarn Factory in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, Qi Zuquan, manager of Chang'an Yarn Factory, Huang Chucai, director of the preparatory committee of the Dyeing and Weaving Cloth Industry Association, and Wang Difei, manager of the First Joint Dyeing and Weaving Factory, all expressed their opinions, unanimously believing that the government's measure can enable the textile industry to obtain appropriate profits and develop substantially. Lu Si'an said excitedly, "Yarn factories can from now on stop worrying about yarn and cloth prices being lower than raw cotton, and can concentrate all their energy on improving production!"

　　Zheng Xiangde, director of the preparatory committee of the Wuxi Cotton Yarn Factory Association in Southern Jiangsu Province, believes that the national purchase of cotton yarn is the concrete implementation of the economic policy in the Common Program and will be of great help to economic construction. Mu Yijun, director of the preparatory committee of the Dyeing and Weaving Factory Association, said: This decision will guide colleagues in the cloth factory industry to the road of developing production and prospering the economy.

　　Zhangjiakou Industry and Commerce Circles Issue Statement
　　The Zhangjiakou Industry and Commerce Circles issued a statement, believing that the Government Administration Council Financial and Economic Committee's decision on the national purchase of cotton yarn fully represents the will of the people of the whole country, especially legitimate industrialists and businessmen, and is also an effective blow to the illegal activities of speculative merchants attempting to hoard and seek exorbitant profits. However, after the American imperialists expanded their war of aggression against Korea, floating capital in the city once again impacted yarn and cloth, which at that time influenced some non-yarn and cloth merchants to rush to purchase. After the government took emergency measures to implement yarn and cloth management, the rush to purchase was quelled. Now, the state has adopted the national purchase of cotton yarn and completely controls yarn and cloth; planned supply to meet the needs of the people is an important step in effectively managing the market. The Zhangjiakou Industry and Commerce Circles fully support the Government Administration Council Financial and Economic Committee's decision, resolutely abide by the government's measures for the management of the yarn and cloth market, do not speculate, do not resell, and give the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation effective support and assistance, and work together to consolidate financial and commodity prices.

　　爱国的工商业界纷纷表示
    拥护政府统购棉纱决定
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会颁发命令施行《关于统购棉纱的决定》后，民主建国会总会、中国纺织工会委员会及上海、杭州、无锡、张家口等市棉纺织业和纱布商业，一致表示热烈拥护。
    民主建国会发言人谈话
    民主建国会发言人发表谈话称：
    政务院财经委员会在本月四日发布的关于统购棉纱的决定，完全符合于全国人民的利益和要求。是当前稳定一般物价的中心环节。我们民主建国会全体会员衷心地热烈地拥护这个决定，并愿为实践这个决定而努力！
    这个决定是与我们工商业者，特别是与纱布业者有关系的。政府在收购价格及工缴费的决定上已照顾到纱布业者的合理利益。我们全国工商业者在抗美援朝中，已有了从来未有的爱国表现，在各地所发动的爱国公约中且有稳定物价、保证供给的口号。因此当政府为着照顾全国人民生活需要及稳定物价而采取这个措施时，我们相信全国爱国的工商业者，必能热烈地拥护政府这个决定，做到不投机囤积，并且在纱布的生产上完全依照政府规定的标准。
    纺织工会委员会决定
    中国纺织工会全国委员会在六日举行的常委扩大会议上通过了关于拥护政务院财经委员会发布的《关于统购棉纱的决定》的决定。该决定指出：统购棉纱的决定对于合理地供给人民穿衣需要与稳定物价有重大意义。各棉纺织厂的工会基层组织都有责任监督这一决定在各该厂完全贯彻执行；各区、省、市工会的委员会有责任监督这一决定在各该区、省、市所有棉纺织企业中完全贯彻执行。纺织工会各级委员会应与公营企业行政方面或私营企业资方共同担负起这个光荣的任务。该决定指出：为了完成这个光荣任务，（１）纺织工会各级委员会要立即认真研究一月四日财经委员会发布的《关于统购棉纱的决定》与人民日报社论《为什么要统购棉纱？》利用各种集会、报纸、黑板报、广播等，将这一决定的意义在纺织职工中广泛宣传。（２）要结合爱国主义生产竞赛，进一步搞好生产，特别注意保证在国家统购棉纱布后，质量不致降低；并且作到纱布产量更高，质量更好，成本更低。（３）纺织工会各级组织特别是基层组织必须准确地及时掌握纱布生产数量和学会计算成本，以便正确地实现群众监督。
    上海纺织界集会
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会公布《关于统购棉纱的决定》后，上海市棉纺织工业公会及私营纱厂、复制厂商、纱布商家一致表示热烈拥护。四日该市棉纺织工业公会召集会员大会，会上大家一致表示“这一决定是照顾各方面的切合当前需要的合理办法，今后我们同业一定为配合政府贯彻实施这个决定而努力。”申新纺织公司总经理荣毅仁指出：这决定对棉纺织工业来说，是有极大利益的，第一、无论自纺自织或代纺代织，都可使企业获得适当的保障；第二、销路的问题，由国营花纱布公司全面调配后，我们可以集中精力，搞好生产；第三、可使我们迅速地进入计划生产，为新民主主义的计划经济奠定稳固的基础。
    该市复制工业方面也一致认为这一决定是正确的。永大染织厂总理唐志尧发表谈话称：由于棉纱全部由国营花纱布公司掌握，对我们复制工业原料的供给，增加了一重保障；同时，合理分配将为棉织品的计划生产奠下基础。
    该市纱、布商业同业公会筹备会也分别发表谈话，一致拥护这一措施。振源棉布号总理吴振珊认为：除拥护这决定外，我们要求加强纱布市场管理，取缔投机囤积，并全心全力来配合国营贸易公司的分配销售，努力为城乡物资交流而工作。
    杭州无锡纺织界发表意见
    浙江省杭州市第一纱厂副理陆思安、长安纱厂经理祁祖铨、染织布业公会筹备会主任黄楚材及染织布第一联营厂经理王迪斐等，均发表意见，一致认为：政府这一措施，可使纺织界获得适当利润和长足发展。陆思安并兴奋地说：“纱厂从此可以不再为纱布价格反低于原棉的事情担忧，可以将全副精神安定地来搞好生产了！”
    苏南无锡市棉纺厂公会筹备会主任郑翔德认为：棉纱统购是共同纲领中经济政策的具体贯彻，对经济建设将有很大的帮助。染织厂公会筹备会主任穆漪君说：这一决定，将引导布厂同业走向发展生产、繁荣经济的大道。
    张家口工商界发表声明
    张家口市工商界发表声明，认为政务院财政经济委员会关于统购棉纱的决定是完全代表了全国人民特别是正当工商业者的意志的，同时也是给投机商人企图囤积居奇，谋取暴利的非法行为给以有效的打击。但当美帝扩大侵朝战争之后，本市游资又向纱布冲击，当时影响若干非经营纱布商人争先抢购，经政府采取紧急措施，实行纱布管理，抢购风潮，始告平息。现在，国家采取棉纱统购，全部掌握纱布；有计划地供给人民需要，这是有效地管理市场的一个重要步骤。张市工商界完全拥护政务院财政经济委员会的决定，坚决遵守政府对纱布市场管理的措施，不投机，不倒把，并予花纱布公司以有效的支持与协助，共同为巩固金融物价而努力。
