　　Hainan Public Security Organs, with the Cooperation of the Masses, Uncovered a Huge Armed Bandit-Spy Case

[This Dispatch] According to this newspaper, the Hainan People's Public Security organs, with the close cooperation of the masses, have uncovered a massive armed special agent case of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The bandit leader, Huang Jun, the major general staff officer of the pseudo-Youth Army Headquarters, and the bandit leaders Zhou Wenqin, the army commander of the pseudo-Youth Army 104th Division, and Lin Haoying, the deputy army commander, and more than 40 other bandits have all been apprehended.

The bandit leader Huang Jun, under the direct instigation of Bai Chongxi on June 20, 1950, secretly entered Hainan Island from Hanoi, Vietnam, by sailing boat. He arrived at Hongsha City and Wanning County, where he contacted the two bandits, Zhou and Lin, and colluded to carry out various counter-revolutionary activities. In addition to organizing underground armed forces, plotting riots, incorporating bandits, committing robberies, and attacking our grassroots government organs, Huang and his cohorts also organized a group of counter-revolutionaries to carry out poisoning and assassinations everywhere, and destroy our warehouses, factories, highways, and power lines. They also used coercion and deception to develop bandit party organizations among the masses, used female charm to seduce our cadres, and even extorted public grain from the masses in the name of the pseudo-regime. The people hated them to the bone.

Although the bandits and spies' activities were secretive, they could not escape the net of the people. When bandit Zhou Wenqin and others sneaked into Wanning County to contact a certain Yang, Yang happened to be out. Yang's son, seeing that Zhou spoke evasively and acted suspiciously, reported it to the local people's government, and the bandit was immediately arrested. That night, the bandit leaders Huang Jun, Guo Fangguang, the pseudo-division commander of the 308th Division of the Bandit Youth Army, and Chen Renfang, the regimental commander, and three other criminals were arrested. Subsequently, under the strict investigation of our public security organs and with the assistance of the broad masses, the pseudo-deputy army commander Lin Haoying, the commander of the 307th Division and the pseudo-Commissioner of the Second Special District of Hainan, Tan Pu, and other bandits, a total of more than 40 criminals, were successively captured, and the case was completely solved. The Hainan People's Court completed the trial of the case on December 9, 1950. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, the chief criminals Huang Jun, Zhou Wenqin, Lin Haoying, and 13 other ringleaders were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in Haikou City on the same day. Another five bandits were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment. The people of the whole island of Hainan were overjoyed when they heard the news.

　　海南公安机关在群众配合下破获巨大武装匪特案
    【本报讯】海南人民公安机关在群众密切配合下，破获了蒋匪巨大武装特务案一起。匪首伪青年军总部少将参谋黄俊，伪青年军一零四军军长周文钦、副军长林皓盈等四十余匪犯全部落网。
    匪首黄俊，一九五○年六月二十日受白匪崇禧直接指使，由越南河内乘帆船潜入海南岛，经由北黎到达红沙市、万宁县一带，与周、林二匪取得联系，会同进行种种反革命活动。黄匪等除组织地下武装，图谋暴动，收编土匪，打家劫舍，袭击我基层政权机关，组织一批反革命分子，到处进行放毒、暗杀，破坏我仓库、工厂、公路、电线外，还以强迫、欺骗等手段，在群众中发展匪党组织，利用女色诱我干部，甚至以伪政权名义，向群众勒索公粮。人民无不恨之入骨。
    匪特们的活动虽然诡密，但终难逃脱人民的法网。当周匪文钦等潜至万宁县与杨某联络时，适值杨某外出。杨某之子见周匪言语支吾，行迹可疑，遂报告当地人民政府，当即将该匪逮捕。当晚又将匪首黄俊、匪青年军一○四军三○八师伪师长郭方光、团长陈仁方等三犯逮捕。嗣后，在我公安机关严密侦察和广大群众协助下，又先后捕获该匪部伪副军长林皓盈、三○七师师长兼伪海南特区二区专员谭朴等匪犯共四十余人，该案乃告全部破获。海南人民法院已于一九五○年十二月九日将该案审理完毕。为了巩固人民民主专政，坚决镇压反革命活动，乃将匪首黄俊、周文钦、林皓盈等十六名首恶分子判处死刑，当日即在海口市执行枪决；另有五名匪犯判处有期徒刑。海南全岛人民闻讯，莫不称快。
