Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: The full text of the "Joint Declaration of the Ethnic Minorities of Beijing on Resisting America and Aiding Korea and Opposing the United States' Arming of Japan Patriotic Demonstration Rally" passed at the Beijing Ethnic Minorities Resist America, Aid Korea, and Oppose the U.S. Arming of Japan Patriotic Demonstration Rally is as follows:

　　Due to the heroic fighting of the powerful Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, American imperialism has suffered a decisive defeat in Korea. This great victory has inspired the world's people with the必胜confidence to oppose war and strive for lasting peace, and has strengthened the Chinese people's will to fight against America and aid Korea. However, American imperialism, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, is plotting a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan in an attempt to save its dying fate. We believe that, under the resistance of the people of the world, it will surely suffer a complete defeat.

　　In the past, the people of all ethnic groups in China suffered from the devastation and oppression of American imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great and brilliant leader Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have expelled imperialism, overthrown reactionary rule, and established their own country—the People's Republic of China. We implement a policy of ethnic equality, unity, and mutual assistance, so that all ethnic groups in China live in a friendly and cooperative family. American imperialism is willing to be an enemy of the people of the world, and it is arming and invading Korea and our Taiwan. We, the people of all ethnic groups in Beijing, in order to completely smash the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism, are determined to unite closely under the banner of Mao Zedong and vow to do everything in our power to fight to the end against resisting America and aiding Korea, opposing the arming of Japan, and defending world peace!

　　Oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea!
　　Oppose American imperialism's aggression and defend world peace!
　　Support Foreign Minister Zhou's four proposals!
　　Oppose American imperialism's arming of Japan!
　　Oppose American imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan!
　　Protest against the atrocities of American imperialism in Korea!
　　Assist the government in eliminating bandits and secret agents!
　　Long live the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers!
　　Long live the victory of the Korean People's Army!
　　Long live Chairman Mao!
　　Long live General Kim Il-sung!
　　Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups in China!

　　大会宣言全文
    【新华社三十日讯】北京市少数民族抗美援朝反对美国武装日本爱国示威游行大会上通过的“北京市少数民族抗美援朝反对美帝武装日本联合宣言”全文如下：
    由于强大的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的英勇战斗，使美帝国主义在朝鲜遭受了决定性的失败。这伟大的胜利，鼓舞了全世界人民反对战争，争取持久和平的必胜信心，并加强了中国人民抗美援朝的斗争意志。但美帝国主义不顾全世界人民的反对，阴谋对日单独媾和，重新武装日本，企图挽救垂死的命运。我们相信：在全世界人民的反抗之下，它必定遭到彻底的失败。
    过去中国各族人民受尽了美帝国主义和国民党反动统治摧残和压迫，现在全国人民在中国共产党和伟大英明领袖毛主席领导下，驱逐了帝国主义，推翻了反动统治，建立了人民自己的国家——中华人民共和国。实行民族平等团结互助政策，使中国各民族生活在友爱合作的大家庭中。美帝国主义甘心与世界人民为敌，武装侵略朝鲜和我国台湾，我们北京市各民族人民为了彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，坚决在毛泽东旗帜下，紧密团结起来，誓尽一切力量，为抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！
    反对美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜！
    反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫世界和平！
    拥护周外长四项建议！
    反对美帝国主义武装日本！
    反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和！
    抗议美帝在朝鲜的暴行！
