    Absorbing the rich experience of Soviet film art, the Polish film industry produces a large number of feature films and documentaries every year.

According to a United Press report from Newport, New Hampshire, on the 9th, Mrs. Gillingham, 53, worried and despondent about the safety of her son serving in Korea, placed a radio in a bathtub filled with water, stepped inside, and turned on the switch, resulting in immediate electrocution.

    Saigon Students in Vietnam Hold Demonstrations
    Students in Saigon held a strike and demonstration on the 9th to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of student Tran Van On. Tran Van On was shot and killed by police of the puppet Bao Dai "government" of French imperialism during a patriotic student demonstration on January 9th last year. This time, the demonstrating students were again suppressed by police gunfire, resulting in the massacre of one student and an unknown number of injuries. This new act of brutality by the French puppet authorities has aroused anger and protests from Vietnamese students.
