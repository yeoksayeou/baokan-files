　　World Knowledge Publishing House New Year Special Issue
    The international affairs weekly "World Knowledge" published a New Year special issue (i.e., Volume 23, Issue 1) on New Year's Day to celebrate the New Year. This issue, titled "Welcoming 1951," published an editorial that outlined the decline of imperialism in the first half of the 20th century; the rapid development and consolidation of progressive social systems—socialism and new democracy—during these fifty years; and the growing revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations. This issue includes special articles such as Cao Heming's "Welcoming New and Greater Victories," Hu Jin's "The Economy of the Capitalist World in 1950," and Chen Yuan's "A Year of the Growing Development of the World People's Movement for Peace." This issue also contains Meng Qing's Vietnam correspondence, "A Record of Ho Chi Minh's Visit"; Hu Qian's "Impressions of England," etc. At the request of readers, the journal specially commissioned Zhu Yuyun to compile and draw a large "Illustrated International Situation of 1950." In addition, there is a comic strip "From 1950 to 1951," written by Ai Na and drawn by Ding Cong, which includes important events of the past year.
