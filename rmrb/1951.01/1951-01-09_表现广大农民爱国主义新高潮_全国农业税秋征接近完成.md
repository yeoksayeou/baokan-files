 Showing the Broad Masses of Peasants' Patriotic New Upsurge
    National Agricultural Tax Autumn Collection Nears Completion

    [Xinhua News Agency News] The 1950 autumn agricultural tax collection work is progressing smoothly throughout the country. As of now, the provinces or administrative regions that have completed all collections include Chahar, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and North Sichuan, as well as the suburbs of Wuhan and Guangzhou. According to statistics from mid- to late-November, the provinces or administrative regions of Northern Jiangsu, Eastern Sichuan, and Southern Sichuan had already completed over 90% of the grain due. Southern Anhui, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shanxi, and Suiyuan provinces or administrative regions are also nearing completion. Other regions such as the Northeast Region, Northwest Region, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in the Central South Region, and Fujian Province in the East China Region are either collecting later due to later harvests or later launches of the tax collection, and farmers are currently enthusiastically delivering grain to warehouses. It is expected that the national autumn collection will be basically completed by the end of January.

    In the movement of enthusiastically paying public grain to the state, the peasants throughout the country have fully demonstrated a new upsurge of patriotism in resisting America and aiding Korea. This is one of the main characteristics of the autumn collection work. Facts have proven that in areas where current affairs propaganda is relatively thorough, the enthusiasm of peasants in paying agricultural taxes is also relatively high. As an example, in the month of November, farmers throughout Chahar Province completed the payment of public grain. In addition, examples of peasants enthusiastically paying are countless. North Sichuan region also collected all public grain in forty days from late October to the end of November. The peasants in the 12th District of Poyang County, Jiangxi Province, were commended by the higher authorities for paying public grain quickly and up to standard. After the public grain was allocated to households in Wannian County, Jiangxi, peasants launched a high tide of paying grain into the warehouse, completing the public grain task five days ahead of schedule, and the public grain paid was dried, clean, and full of grains. Li Meiying, a member of the Communist Youth League from Xinhua Township in the 6th District of the county, said: "This year's payment is for the liberation grain and the Resist America Aid Korea grain. Who would be willing to pay bad grain? Our grain is not only dried, but also blown several times." In Yancheng Prefecture, Northern Jiangsu, farmers in many districts and townships paid off all the public grain due in one or two days or even a few hours. In Linhai District, Binhai County, the district paid off all the grains on the day the tax collection started without any arrears.

    This autumn collection in the vast new areas was carried out according to the unified Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax promulgated by the Central People's Government. Due to the implementation of the policy of tax collection according to tax rates, the burden on farmers has become fairer and more reasonable. The East China Region was well prepared in this regard and implemented it well. After summarizing the summer collection, the region further investigated farmland, divided grades, and determined normal annual output. After the autumn collection began, various localities implemented tax collection according to rates based on rural land, output, annual harvests, and social conditions, thus winning the support of the broad masses of peasants, and the autumn collection progressed rapidly.

    In the autumn collection, peasants in various localities have also exposed the landlords' conspiracies to conceal black land and attempt to shift the burden, which is one of the important reasons for making the burden fair and reasonable and the work proceed smoothly. The black land discovered in various parts of Southern Sichuan this time averaged 30% of the land reported by the landlords. Due to the peasants' discovery of landlords' concealing land and production in Huichang County, Jiangxi Province, the county's burden ratio was reduced from 21% of the total output to 13%. After the struggle to squeeze out black land was launched in Zhejiang Province, the total amount of added farmland in the province reached 10% to 15% of the total.

    Areas that have completed the autumn collection are now building granaries and strengthening the management of public grain. In November, Jiangxi Province reorganized the public grain collection committees in various places into warehouse protection and management committees. Grain management departments in various parts of Hunan Province are organizing forces to carry out drying, turning warehouses, and ventilation. Areas that have not yet completed the collection are strengthening the organization of grain collection work, and areas that are about to be completed have paid attention to the slack mood of cadres, calling on them to make persistent efforts and quickly complete the autumn collection task.

### 表现广大农民爱国主义新高潮  全国农业税秋征接近完成

　　表现广大农民爱国主义新高潮
    全国农业税秋征接近完成
    【新华社讯】一九五○年农业税秋征工作，在全国各地进展顺利。截至目前，已全部完成的计有察哈尔、湖南、江西、湖北、河南、川北等省或行政区，以及武汉、广州两市郊区。苏北、川东、川南等省或行政区，据十一月中、下旬统计，即已完成应征公粮的百分之九十以上。皖南、浙江、河北、山西、绥远等省或行政区亦接近完成。其他各地如东北区、西北区、中南区的广东省和广西省、华东区福建省等，或因收获季节较迟，或因开征较晚，目前农民正在向仓库踊跃送粮。全国秋征，预计一月底就可基本上全部完成。
    全国农民在向国家踊跃缴纳公粮的运动中，充分表现了抗美援朝的爱国主义新高潮。这是秋征工作中的主要特点之一。事实证明：凡时事宣传比较深入的地区，农民缴纳农业税的热情也比较高。在十一月一个月中，察哈尔省全省农民即已将公粮交纳完毕，即为一例。此外，农民踊跃交纳的事例，不胜枚举。川北全区于十月下旬到十一月底的四十天中，亦已将所有的公粮全部收齐。江西省鄱阳县十二区农民因为交的公粮又快，又合标准，曾得到上级通令嘉奖的表扬。江西万年县农民，在公粮分配到户后，即掀起了缴粮入仓的热潮，使公粮任务提前五天完成，所缴公粮都是晒干风净，粒粒饱满。该县六区新华乡青年团员李梅英说：“今年缴的是翻身粮和抗美援朝粮。谁肯缴坏的呢，我们的谷子不但晒的干，而且还吹了几次风。”苏北盐城专区不少区和乡的农民，在一两天或几小时内就交清了应交的全部公粮，该区滨海县临海区于开征的当天即扫数交齐，无一尾欠。
    这次广大新区的秋征，是根据中央人民政府所颁布的统一的农业税暂行办法进行的。各地由于执行了依税率计征的政策，因而使农户的负担更趋公平合理。华东区在这方面准备较充分，贯彻较好。该区在总结夏征后，曾进一步调查田亩，划分等级，定出常年产量。秋征开始后，各地就根据农村土地、产量、年景和社会条件等情况，实行依率计征，因而得到广大农民的拥护，秋征进展很快。
    在秋征中，各地农民纷纷揭发地主隐瞒黑田、企图转嫁负担的阴谋，也是使负担公平合理、工作进行顺利的重要原因之一。川南各地这次查出的黑田，平均占地主所报土地的百分之三十。江西省会昌县农民由于查出地主的瞒田瞒产，使全县负担比例由占总产量的百分之二十一，减为百分之十三。浙江省展开挤黑田斗争后，全省增加的田亩达总数的百分之十到百分之十五。
    已完成秋征的地区现正修建粮仓并加强公粮的保管工作。江西省十一月份已将各地公粮征收委员会改组为护仓保管委员会。湖南省各地粮食保管部门，正在组织力量进行翻晒、倒仓和通风等工作。尚未完成的地区正在加强组织收粮工作，即将完成的地区已注意干部的松气情绪，号召再接再厉，迅速完成秋征任务。
