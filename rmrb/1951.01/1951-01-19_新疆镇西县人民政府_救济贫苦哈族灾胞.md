　　The Zhenxi County People's Government of Xinjiang
    Provides Relief to Impoverished Kazakh Compatriots Affected by Disaster
    In order to help local disaster victims—mainly Kazakh compatriots living in hardship—overcome the famine, the Zhenxi County People's Government of Hami District, Xinjiang Province, distributed two batches of relief grain, totaling eighteen dan and two dou of wheat, and two hundred and fifty sheep, basically solving the problem of food shortages during the disaster period.

    Last September was the most difficult time for the disaster-stricken Kazakhs. In order to urgently take care of the lives of the disaster victims, the government convened a Kazakh symposium and then distributed the first batch of relief grain. At that time, due to insufficient preparation, there were still unreasonable aspects in the distribution of relief grain and livestock.

    Learning from this experience and lessons, the distribution of the second batch of relief grain was much more cautious. This time, not only was attention paid to the number of households and the population in the distribution, but also a detailed investigation was made into the living conditions of the households receiving relief. During the distribution, democratic appraisal was used to discuss the amount to be distributed to each household. At the meeting, it was also emphasized that this was not a simple relief effort and should be closely integrated with production.

    Due to the care of the People's Government for the Kazakh compatriots, the masses generally reflected, "If it were not for the relief from the Communist Party and the People's Government this year, we poor people would really have no way to survive." Poor herder Si Ake said, "During the time of the Kuomintang, it was either apportionment of funds or demanding grain and livestock. How could they possibly issue relief grain to you?" Helpless and destitute poor man Kahaer said, "The government invites us to eat and drink, and when we leave, they also give us relief grain. I have lived for eighty years and have never seen such a good government. Comparing the past and the present, it is truly like two different worlds!"

### 新疆镇西县人民政府  救济贫苦哈族灾胞

　　新疆镇西县人民政府
    救济贫苦哈族灾胞
    新疆省哈密区镇西县人民政府为了帮助当地灾民——主要是生活困难的哈族同胞——度过灾荒，发出两批救济粮，计小麦十八石二斗，羊二百五十只，基本上解决了灾期缺乏口粮的问题。
    去年九月，是受灾哈胞生活最困难的时候，政府为了急于照顾灾民生活，因此召开哈族座谈会后，便发放第一批救济粮。当时因为没有充分准备，在分配救济粮、牲畜上，还有不合理的地方。
    接受这一次的经验教训，发放第二批救济粮时，便审慎多了。这一次不仅分配上照顾到户数、人口，并详细调查了被救济户的生活情形。在发放中通过民主评议，讨论每一户的发放数量。在会议上，并强调说明这不是单纯的救济，应与生产密切结合起来。
    由于人民政府对哈族同胞的照顾，群众普遍反映：“今年如果没有共产党和人民政府的救济，我们穷人真没有办法活下去。”贫苦牧民斯阿克说：“国民党的时候，不是摊款，便是要粮，要牲畜，那里还能给你发救济粮。”孤苦无依的贫民卡哈尔道：“政府请我们吃、喝，临走的时候，还发给救济粮。我活了八十岁，没有见过这样好的政府。过去和现在相比，真是两个天！”
