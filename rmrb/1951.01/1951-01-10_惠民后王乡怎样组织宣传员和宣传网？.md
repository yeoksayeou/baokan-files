Propagandist Work

　　Editor's Note: The propagandist work in Houwang Township, Er District, Huimin County, Shandong Province, has played a certain role in organizational leadership and ideological education for propagandists. However, the method adopted by Huimin County in developing propagandists, which allowed mass recommendations and elections, was incorrect. The Party Central Committee stipulates that the appointment of propagandists should be based on the appropriate conditions they already possess, after review and approval by the Party branch committee and higher-level Party organizations.

Under the assistance of the prefectural committee, the Propaganda Department of the Huimin County Committee of Shandong Province established propagandists and organized a propaganda network in Houwang Township, Er District of the county, which played a significant role in promoting the current affairs propaganda work. Houwang Township has a total of twelve villages. Last autumn, the district Communist Youth League committee developed propagandists within the League in the township (mainly for internal League education), which played a certain role at the time; however, due to the subsequent relaxation of education and leadership, it mostly became a mere formality. The work of establishing propagandists and organizing a propaganda network this time, from November 5th to 28th, developed a total of thirty-eight propagandists, established seven propaganda groups, established a township propaganda sub-station, initially trained the propagandists, and enabled them to play a role in propaganda.

The propagandists are all in high spirits. In order to solve the difficulties of learning and propaganda materials, some villages pooled money to subscribe to newspapers, and some, after discussing with village cadres, had the village subscribe to a newspaper. They used various methods to explain current affairs issues to the masses in a popular way. For example, they compared the relationship between China and North Korea to two good neighbors, and explained that the US imperialists set a fire in Korea, and if we do not put it out, it will burn our own houses. If they are not very clear about the problems themselves, they ask the higher authorities for instructions, and then propagate them to the masses. After the propaganda, the masses in the township generally recognized the US imperialists' aggressive conspiracy and the reason why China must aid Korea.

How did Houwang Township establish propagandists and organize a propaganda network?

How to develop propagandists? At the beginning of the work, the township branch committee, party and youth league members' meetings in each village, village cadres' meetings, and villagers' meetings were held to explain the significance and importance of establishing propagandists and organizing a propaganda network through current affairs propaganda. The masses expressed their opinions on this work. They said: "This is a good thing. With propagandists, we can open our minds. If we don't understand something, we can ask the propagandists." This laid the foundation for carrying out this work.

In the process of developing propagandists, the following three methods were adopted: ① Party and League branches held meetings to study and determine the selection of propagandist candidates and provide education and training (generally, party and League members with propaganda ability are first identified). ② Propagandists are recommended or elected by the masses. ③ A village cadre meeting is held to discuss and determine the candidates for propagandists. The second method is the best. Because the elected propagandists generally have prestige among the masses and have closer relationships with the masses. Therefore, they play a greater role in conducting propaganda among the masses, and can also understand the masses' thoughts in a timely manner; the masses are also willing to take the initiative to ask him about things they do not understand. For example, Zhang Hongcai (propaganda committee member of the village youth league) a propagandist in Majia Dike Village, was elected by the masses. After he was elected, the masses who did not understand why they should resist the United States and aid Korea asked him. After Hu Jitang (model of river management), a propagandist in Yinjia Village, was elected, someone immediately reflected the thoughts of the masses to him. However, when electing propagandists, it is necessary to explain to the masses in advance the conditions that propagandists should have, such as having propaganda ability, being active in work, and having a strong political understanding; otherwise, there will be biases. For example, in some villages, because the masses were not educated enough in advance, the propagandists elected were either those with propaganda ability but not active in work, or vice versa. Propagandists developed using methods ① and ③ are generally competent. However, one must be very cautious when choosing candidates, and especially pay attention to prestige and close relationships with the masses; otherwise, even if they have propaganda ability, they will not achieve good results.

How to lead? In villages where three or more propagandists have been developed, propaganda groups have been established, and group leaders have been elected (villages with many propagandists have deputy group leaders). Villages with less than three propagandists are merged with neighboring villages to form a group, with one leader and one deputy leader. A single propagandist who is far away from other villages is directly led by the township propaganda sub-station. In terms of leadership relations, in addition to the vertical system leadership of the propaganda network, they also accept the branch leadership of the same-level party organs.

The organization of the township sub-station is composed of the township branch propaganda committee, public security committee, and others. Two meetings of propaganda group leaders have been held, mainly to study and arrange how to publicize and what to publicize.

How to educate? First of all, ideological education should be carried out. After the propagandists were elected, the following ideological problems were discovered: some were afraid that they "couldn't do it," some were afraid that they would "delay production," and some felt that "being a propagandist has raised their status" and that "the masses look up to them," and so on. If these ideological problems are not corrected, it will be difficult to achieve the desired propaganda effect. In order to correct the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, the leadership carried out ideological education on "wholeheartedly serving the people" for the propagandists. At the same time, it was explained that being a propagandist does not mean giving up production, but carrying out propaganda work in conjunction with production. For those who think they "can't do it," they are told that as long as they study hard, there is no reason why they can't do it.

After patient education, all the ideological concerns of the propagandists were dispelled.

How to carry out propaganda work? After the propaganda groups were established, the propagandists were very active, but they were troubled by not knowing how to carry out propaganda. Therefore, a meeting of propaganda groups in each village was held to study propaganda methods. Each village adopted different methods according to the different work situations of the propagandists: for example, those who were originally village cadres were assigned to mainly carry out propaganda at various meetings in the village; those who were winter school teachers mainly carried out propaganda in the winter school; those who were primary school teachers assisted the propaganda committee of the League branch in publishing blackboards on time, and organized reading groups. After this division of labor, the propagandists all clarified how they should carry out propaganda work.

In order to enable the propagandists to exert greater effectiveness, the leadership also helped the propaganda groups in each village establish a learning and meeting system. However, when stipulating the system, two points should be paid attention to: First, the study time should not be too long, and second, the meeting content should not be too much, otherwise it will affect the propaganda effect and delay mass production.

　　惠民后王乡怎样组织宣传员和宣传网？
    李笑星
    编者按：山东惠民县二区后王乡宣传员工作，在组织领导及对宣传员的思想教育上，都起了一定的作用。但惠民县在发展宣传员时所采取的那种听任群众推荐、选举的方式，却是不对的。党中央规定：宣传员的任命，应按照他已具有的适当条件，经过党的支部委员会的审查通过和高一级党组织的批准。
    山东惠民县委宣传部在地委协助下，在本县二区后王乡建立了宣传员和组织了宣传网，对当前的时事宣传工作起了很大的推动作用。后王乡全乡共十二个村。去年秋天，区青年团团委曾在该乡青年团内发展过宣传员（主要是进行团内教育），当时也起了一定作用；但由于以后放松了教育与领导，致多流于形式。这次建立宣传员，组织宣传网的工作，从十一月五日至二十八日止，共发展宣传员三十八名，建立了七个宣传小组，成立了乡宣传分站，初步集训了宣传员，并使他们在宣传中发挥了作用。
    宣传员的情绪都很高。他们为了解决学习和宣传材料的困难，有的村几个人凑钱订了报纸，有的和村干部研究后，由村里订一份报纸。他们曾运用各种方式，通俗地向群众讲解了时事问题。如他们把中朝关系比作两个好邻居，并说明美帝在朝鲜放了火，我们要不救就会烧到自己的房子里来。自己还弄不太清楚的问题，就请示上级，然后向群众宣传。经过宣传，该乡群众一般都认识了美帝的侵略阴谋和中国必须援朝的道理。
    后王乡是怎样建立起宣传员和组织宣传网的呢？
    如何发展宣传员？工作开始时，首先召开了乡支委会和各村党、团员大会、村干部会以及村民大会等，通过时事宣传，说明了建立宣传员，组织宣传网的意义和重要性。群众对这一工作都发表了意见。他们说：“这是好事。有了宣传员，咱们就能开脑筋。不明白的事，问宣传员也就知道了。”这样就给开展这一工作奠定了基础。
    在发展宣传员的过程中，采用了以下三种方法：①党、团支部开会研究、确定选择宣传员对象、加以教育培养（一般是首先确定有宣传能力的党、团员）。②由群众推荐或选举宣传员。③召开村干部会议，讨论确定宣传员人选。这三种方法，以第二种方法最好。因为被选举的宣传员，一般是在群众中有声望，并与群众关系较密切的。因此，他们对群众进行宣传时作用较大，也能及时了解群众的思想情况；群众不明白的事情，也愿意主动地去问他。如马家堤口村宣传员张洪才（村青年团宣传委员）是群众选举的，在他当选之后，不明白为什么要抗美援朝的群众，都找他去问。尹家村选出了宣传员胡吉堂（治黄模范）之后，当场就有人向他反映群众的思想情况。但在选举宣传员时，必须先给群众讲明宣传员应具备的条件，如有宣传能力，工作积极，及政治认识较强等；否则便会发生偏向。如有的村因为事先对群众教育不够，致选出的宣传员，有的是有宣传能力，但工作不积极，或是相反的情形。采用①、③两种方法发展的宣传员，一般的也能胜任。但在选择对象时，必须十分慎重，特别应注意有声望、与群众关系密切这一点；否则，虽具有宣传能力，也不能收到良好效果。
    如何领导？该乡凡是发展有三个宣传员以上的村子，都建立了宣传小组，选举了组长（宣传员多的村设副组长）。宣传员不到三人的村，与邻村合并组成一个小组，设正副组长各一人。只有一个宣传员、又与其他村距离较远的，则直接受乡宣传分站的领导。在领导关系上，除宣传网的垂直系统的领导外，并接受同级党委机关的支部领导。
    该乡乡分站的组织是由乡支部宣传委员、公安委员等人组成。现已开过两次宣传小组组长会议，主要是研究布置怎样宣传，宣传什么等问题。
    如何教育？首先应进行思想教育。宣传员选出后，发现下列思想问题：怕“干不了”，怕“耽误生产”，也有人觉得“当了宣传员提高了地位”，“群众看得起啦”等等。如对这些思想问题不予以纠正，就很难收到预期的宣传效果。为纠正上述错误思想，领导上对宣传员进行了“全心全意为人民服务”的思想教育。同时说明，宣传员不是放弃生产，而是结合生产进行宣传工作。对认为“干不了”的，就向他说明只要好好学习，没有干不了的道理。
    经过耐心教育，宣传员的各种思想顾虑都被打破了。
    如何开展宣传工作？宣传小组成立后，宣传员都很积极，但苦于不知如何进行宣传。因此便召开各村宣传小组会议，研究了宣传方式。各村并根据宣传员不同的工作情况，采取了各种不同的方式：如原来是村干部的，就确定主要是在村里的各种会议上进行宣传；是冬学教师的，主要在冬学里宣传；是小学教师的，协助团支部的宣传委员，按时出黑板报，并组织读报组。这样分工后，宣传员都明确了自己应怎样进行宣传工作了。
    为使宣传员发挥更大的效能，领导上还帮助各村宣传小组建立了学习、会议制度。但在规定制度时，应注意两点：一是学习时间不要定得太长，一是会议内容不宜太多，否则就会影响宣传效果，耽误群众生产。
