The people of Northeast China, at the forefront of national defense, have victoriously completed the economic construction tasks of 1950 amidst the intense struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and are entering 1951 with full confidence.

In 1950, the Northeast People's Government determined to focus all efforts on economic reconstruction in Northeast China. The original plan called for the total value of industrial production to increase by 93% compared to 1949, and for the proportion of industry in the overall national economy to rise from about 35% in 1949 to 43%. However, in June, the heinous U.S. imperialism brazenly launched a war of aggression against Korea, and even extended the flames of aggression to the border of Northeast China. U.S. invading troops' aircraft constantly intruded into our airspace, slaughtering our people. Under these circumstances, the people of Northeast China had to engage in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and defend national security while steadfastly pursuing the arduous task of economic construction.

The people of Northeast China, at the forefront of national defense, bravely shouldered this dual task. In addition to providing a continuous stream of manpower and material resources to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, coordinating with the Korean People's Army to extinguish the flames of aggression that had spread to our border, and inflicting a serious blow on U.S. imperialism, achieving a great victory of decisive significance, the people of Northeast China also specifically implemented the glorious task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country at every work post.

Thanks to the concerted efforts of the people of Northeast China, and with the friendly assistance of Soviet experts, and especially due to the people's increased understanding of the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism in the upsurge of the patriotic movement, they demonstrated maximum initiative and creativity in overcoming the difficulties increased by the U.S. imperialist expansion of aggression. The economic construction plan for 1950 has not only been completed but has also exceeded the quota. The following preliminary statistics demonstrate the great achievements of Northeast China's economic construction in the past year:

The total value of state-owned industry and agricultural crop production increased by 65.3% compared to 1949, completing 102.7% of the plan. Among them, the total value of industrial production increased by 100.5% compared to 1949, completing 101.8% of the plan; the total value of agricultural production increased by 44.1% compared to the previous year, completing 103.4% of the plan.

In terms of railway transportation, the annual car loading plan was completed one month ahead of schedule. The total volume of state-owned inland waterway freight increased by 175% compared to 1949.

In terms of agricultural production, the cultivated land area in 1950 increased by 5.7% compared to 1949, completing 103.3% of the plan. The total grain output increased by 37% compared to 1949, completing 107.4% of the plan.

In terms of state-owned commerce, the total purchase value in the region increased by 178.7% compared to 1949, and the total sales value increased by 116% compared to 1949. Among them, the supply of cotton cloth needed by the people was equal to 226% of that in 1949.

Cooperatives have also developed greatly. The number of primary-level cooperatives has increased by 19.4% compared to 1949, and the number of members has increased by 127% compared to 1949. The total retail sales in 1950 increased by 494% compared to 1949, completing 125.8% of the plan; the total procurement value increased by 394% compared to 1949, completing 107.4% of the plan. This clearly shows that Northeast China's cooperative economy has become a strong force in the people's economy, occupying an increasingly important position in the people's economic life.

With the development of economic construction, people's lives are also continuously improving. According to typical survey materials, the people's purchasing power in rural areas in 1950 increased by an average of 32% compared to 1949, and in urban areas, it increased by an average of 12.5% compared to 1949. What is especially important is that in the tense situation, the prices in Northeast China have remained basically stable without fluctuations over the past year, which especially demonstrates the strength of our economic power.

Due to the development of the state-owned economy and the increase in people's purchasing power, especially the purchasing power of farmers, private industry and commerce have also achieved great development. Taking Shenyang as an example, comparing the third quarter of 1950 with the first quarter, the capital of established merchants increased by 108%, the sales revenue increased by 26%, the industrial capital increased by 94%, and the total production value increased by 132%.

The above-mentioned great achievements in economic construction, and the resulting improvement in people's lives, were achieved under the serious threat of U.S. imperialist aggression. Therefore, it can be affirmed that if there were no threat of U.S. imperialist aggression, the achievements would certainly be even greater. The people of Northeast China, at the forefront of national defense, amidst the cheers of the great victories of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and amidst the cheers of the great achievements of economic construction in 1950, are filled with confidence in victory, and are striving for even greater victories in 1951 with more intense work and effort!

　　一年来的东北经济建设
    处于国防最前线的东北人民，在紧张的抗美援朝保家卫国斗争中，已胜利完成了一九五○年的经济建设任务，正满怀信心地踏入一九五一年。
    一九五○年东北人民政府确定以全力进行东北经济重建工作，原定计划工业生产总值要比一九四九年增加百分之九十三，工业在整个国民经济中所占比重要由一九四九年的百分之三十五左右提高到百分之四十三。但六月间万恶的美帝国主义悍然发动侵略朝鲜的战争，并曾经将侵略战火延烧到我东北边境，美国侵朝军队的飞机更不断侵入我国领空，屠杀我国人民。在此情况下，东北人民不得不一面进行反抗美帝国主义侵略、保卫祖国安全的斗争，一面还要坚定不移地从事繁重的经济建设事业。
    处在国防最前线的东北人民英勇地肩负起这双重的任务。东北人民除了以源源不绝的人力物力支援中国人民志愿军，配合朝鲜人民军扑灭了已经延烧到我国边境的侵略火焰，给予美帝国主义以严重打击，取得了决定意义的伟大胜利以外，同时把抗美援朝保家卫国的光荣任务具体贯彻到每一个人的工作岗位上。
    由于东北人民的一致努力，并获得了苏联专家的友谊援助，尤其重要的是由于人民群众在高涨的爱国主义运动中提高了对美帝国主义侵略本质的认识，因而在克服因美帝国主义扩大侵略所增加的困难中，发挥最大的积极性和创造性，一九五○年的经济建设计划不仅已告完成，而且已超过定额。下述的初步统计，即可显示出东北经济建设在一年来的伟大成就。
    公营工业与农作物生产总值比一九四九年增加了百分之六十五点三，完成计划百分之一○二点七。其中工业生产总值比一九四九年增加百分之一○○点五，完成计划百分之一○一点八；农业生产总值比前年增加百分之四十四点一，完成计划百分之一○三点四。
    铁路运输方面提前一个月完成了全年装车计划。国营内河货运总量比一九四九年增加了百分之一七五。
    农业生产方面一九五○年耕地面积较一九四九年增加了百分之五点七，完成计划百分之一○三点三。粮食总产量较一九四九年增加了百分之三十七，完成计划百分之一○七点四。
    国营商业方面，区内的收购总值比一九四九年增加百分之一七八点七，销售总值比一九四九年增加了百分之一一六，其中供应人民需要的纱布一项便等于一九四九年的百分之二二六。
    合作社也有很大发展，现有基层社比一九四九年增加了百分之十九点四，社员比一九四九年增加了百分之一二七，一九五○年零售总额比一九四九年增加了百分之四九四，完成计划百分之一二五点八；采购总额比一九四九年增加了百分之三九四，完成计划百分之一○七点四。这明显地表示东北的合作经济已经成为强大的人民经济力量，在人民的经济生活中日益占有重要的地位。
    随着经济建设的发展，人民生活也在不断改善，根据典型调查的材料：一九五○年人民的购买力在乡村平均比一九四九年提高百分之三十二，在城市平均比一九四九年提高百分之十二点五。尤其重要的是：在紧张的形势下，一年来东北的物价基本上保持稳定而没有波动，这尤其显示出我们经济力量之雄厚。
    由于国营经济的发展和人民购买力特别是农民购买力的提高，私营工商业也获得了很大发展。以沈阳为例，一九五○年第三季与第一季比较，座商资金增加了百分之一○八，卖钱额增加了百分之二六，工业资金增加了百分之九四，生产总值增加了百分之一三二。
    上述经济建设的伟大成就，以及由此而来的人民生活的改善，是在美帝国主义侵略的严重威胁下所达成的，因此可以肯定：如果没有美帝国主义的侵略威胁，成绩还一定会更大。处在国防最前线的东北人民，在欢呼中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的伟大胜利声中，在欢呼一九五○年经济建设的巨大成就声中，洋溢着胜利的信心，以更紧张的工作和努力，争取一九五一年的更大胜利！（新华社）
