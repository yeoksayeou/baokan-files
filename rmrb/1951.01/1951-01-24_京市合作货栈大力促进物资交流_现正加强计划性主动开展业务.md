　　[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Cooperative Freight Station plays a bridging role in urban and rural material exchange. Its business saw significant development last year, bringing a large quantity of agricultural and sideline products into the city and urban industrial products to the countryside. It has also explored some experiences in strengthening planned management and reducing commodity circulation links.
    Last year, the station purchased and sold goods worth a total of 67.2 billion yuan for cooperative societies, state-owned enterprises, and private enterprises in various regions. Among these, agricultural products accounted for 68.13 percent and industrial products accounted for 31.87 percent. The volume of transactions increased significantly compared to the previous year. Taking August, the busiest month for trade each year, as an example, the total trade value in August last year was 10.9 billion yuan, an increase of as much as twelve times compared to August of the previous year. The scope of business contacts has gradually expanded. In the previous year, business contacts were only with county cooperatives, farmers, and small vendors near Beijing. Last year, it expanded to cooperative societies and state-owned enterprises in major administrative regions, provinces, counties, and cities such as the Northeast, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Taiyuan and Zhengzhou. As a result, surplus grain from grain-producing areas in the Northeast and Northwest was able to be transported to grain-deficient disaster areas such as Hebei, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui. Cloth, towels, socks, and toothbrushes from North China were sold to the Northeast and Northwest. White sugar, paper, pork, and apples from the Northeast, coke from Shanxi, chicken eggs from Rehe, grass bags from Anhui, and sleeping mats and umbrellas from Zhejiang were sold to North China. It played a certain role in increasing farmers' purchasing power and promoting the sales of urban industrial products.
    Over the past year, the station has also made some progress in reforming internal organizational systems, simplifying procedures, and reducing procurement and sales costs. Various purchasing and sales commission fees have been reduced successively. For example, the grain transaction fee was originally 1.5 percent, but was reduced to 1 percent from the fourth quarter of last year. The total commission fees for various goods transactions throughout the year were more than 586 million yuan lower than if entrusted to private freight stations. In addition, the station improved the storage management of goods entering and leaving the warehouse, reduced damage and loss, lowered costs, and ensured quality. For example, the damage and loss rate of grain was reduced from 2 percent to 1 percent.
    In the past, the main shortcomings of the station's business operations were a lack of planning and organization, with many goods being stored in the warehouse before customers were found and dealing with things piecemeal. The station has begun to improve these shortcomings in three aspects, striving to raise the level from spot entrustment to planned management. First, various regions are requested to report their entrusted purchase and sale plans for the first quarter of this year. The freight station proactively understands the needs of various regions, and then formulates an overall comprehensive plan and enters into transaction contracts with relevant parties separately. Currently, the Henan Provincial Cooperative Federation, Zhuolu County Cooperative, and other places have submitted plans. Henan Province plans to request the consignment of wool, medicinal materials, and tung oil, and the purchase of matches, colored paper, and corn, etc. The plans reported by various regions also specify the specifications, quality, and prices of the required goods, and attach samples. Doing this work well will be a crucial key to the station's business moving towards planned management. Second, organize decentralized businesses into batch direct exchanges to reduce commodity circulation links and accelerate commodity turnover. For example, organizing the Suiyuan, Xuanhua, and Zhangjiakou Cooperatives to establish sorghum supply contracts with the Wine Industry Monopoly Company and the Kailuan Coal Mine Employee Consumer Cooperative. In the recent transaction of supplying 1.08 million jin of sorghum, both parties directly allocated and picked up the goods without stopping at the Beijing warehouse, saving 4.08 million yuan in loading and unloading fees and dispatching fees, saving 2.7 million yuan in transaction commission fees, and also eliminating 1 percent damage and loss. In addition, strengthening research on market conditions in various regions is also an important work that the station is striving to improve. After understanding the market conditions in various regions, the station proactively asks various regions for goods to sell. For example, it recently requested peanuts from Tangshan and peanuts from Daming, while Tangshan and Daming are feeling that these kinds of local products cannot be sold, while the Beijing market has a large capacity for these kinds of local products. In this way, it has completely changed the past way of sitting at home and waiting.

　　京市合作货栈大力促进物资交流
　  现正加强计划性主动开展业务
    【京市新闻处讯】京市合作货栈发挥城乡物资交流的桥梁作用，去年业务有很大发展，使大量农副业产品进城，城市工业品下乡，并在加强计划经营和减少商品流转环节上，摸索出一些经验。
    该栈去年全年代各地合作社、国营企业、私营企业采购和推销的商品总值达六百七十二亿元。其中农产品占百分之六八·一三，工业品占百分之三一·八七。交易量比前年有显著增加，以每年贸易最旺的八月份为例，去年八月份贸易总值是一○九亿元，比前年八月份增高达十二倍之多。业务联系面逐步扩大，前年发生业务联系的只是北京附近的县合作社、农民和小商贩，去年扩大到东北、山西、江苏、浙江、安徽和太原、郑州等大行政区、省、县、市的合作社与国营企业。因而使东北、西北产粮区的富余食粮能够输送到河北、苏北、皖北等缺粮的灾区，使华北的布匹、毛巾、袜子、牙刷运销到东北和西北，使东北的白糖、纸张、猪肉、苹果，山西的焦炭，热河的鸡子，安徽的草袋，浙江的凉席、雨伞运销到华北。对提高农民购买力，推广城市工业品销路起了一定作用。
    该栈在改革内部机构制度、简化手续、降低采购推销成本方面，一年来也有一些进步。各项代购代销手续费陆续降低，如食粮交易手续费原来是百分之一·五，自去年第四季起降低为百分之一。去年全年各种货物交易的手续费比委托私营货栈经营要节省五亿八千六百多万元。此外，该栈更改进了货物出仓入库的保管工作，减少伤耗损失，降低了成本，保证了质量，如食粮的伤耗率即由百分之二减为百分之一。
    过去该栈业务经营的主要缺点，是缺乏计划性、组织性，许多货物进仓后现找主顾，零来零办。该栈对这种缺点，已从三方面着手改进，努力由现货委托的水平提高为计划经营。首先，请各地造报本年第一季委托购销计划，货栈主动了解了各地需要，然后订出总的全面计划，分别与有关方面订立交易合同。现在已有河南省合作总社、涿鹿县合作社等地提出计划，河南省拟请代销羊毛、药材和桐油，代购火柴，片艳纸和玉米等。各地造报的计划还说明需要货物的规格、质量、价格，并附寄样品。做好这一工作将是该栈业务走上计划经营的重要关键。其次，组织分散业务为成批直接交换，减少商品流转环节，加速商品周转。如组织绥远、宣化、张家口合作社与酒业专卖公司、开滦煤矿职工消费社建立高粱米供应合同，在最近供应一○八万斤高粱米的交易中，双方直接拨货提货，不在北京进仓停留，节省了四○八万元的装卸费、调车费，节省了交易手续费二百七十万元，还免掉百分之一伤耗。此外对各地行情加强研究，也是该栈努力改进的重要工作。在了解各地行情之后，该栈主动找各地要货销货，如最近即向唐山要花生仁，向大名要花生，而唐山、大名正感到这类土产销不出去，同时，北京市场则对这类土产容量很大。这样，就完全转变了过去在家坐等的方式。
