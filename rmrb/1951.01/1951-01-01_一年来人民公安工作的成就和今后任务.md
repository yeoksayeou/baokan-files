The past year, under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, public security organs at all levels have resolutely implemented the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They have begun to establish a strong people's public security force throughout the country, powerfully打击 (dǎjī - attacked) the activities of bandits and secret agents echoing the US imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression, safeguarded production and construction and the safety of the people, suppressed all sabotage conspiracies of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries, established and consolidated the revolutionary order of urban and rural areas in new and old liberated areas, cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to defend the national defense, and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship.

As is well known, the Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of imperialism, regarded the raising of a large number of secret agents as one of the important pillars for maintaining their rule. After its open forces were eliminated, after an initial period of panic, under the instruction of US imperialism, it reorganized its original secret service organization and retrained a group of new secret agents and spies to engage in various sabotage activities covertly. However, our entire public security personnel, giving full play to their high degree of initiative, coupled with the active assistance of the broad masses of the people, constantly dealt powerful blows to the lurking enemy. From January to October of this year, a total of 664 major espionage cases and 9 international espionage cases were cracked nationwide, and 13,812 special agents were captured (including 1,078 important special agents above the group leader and detachment leader level), and some counter-revolutionaries who were guilty of heinous crimes and refused to repent were severely suppressed—sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment. Those special agents who were not guilty of capital crimes but could be reformed and educated were detained and forced to work, giving them a chance to reform themselves. For the general accomplices who participated in counter-revolutionary activities, a certain period of control was carried out separately, and many of those who had indeed repented had their control lifted. The experience of the past year has proved that only by correctly implementing the policy of "combining suppression with leniency" towards counter-revolutionaries can counter-revolutionary activities be more effectively打击 (dǎjī - attacked). In urban management, due to the Kuomintang's long-term reactionary rule, which specialized in creating poverty, a large number of people lost their livelihoods, drifted into urban and rural areas, and became bandits, endangering social security. Especially in the newly liberated cities, bandit activities had a considerable impact on urban security. However, after a year of efforts by the People's Public Security Organs, these bandits have been basically eliminated. A small number of habitual bandits and habitual thieves who have repeatedly refused to reform, and the special agents among them, have been punished as they deserve; most have become new people in labor reform, or are undergoing labor reform. According to statistics from twelve major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Chongqing alone, 2,197 robbery cases and 31,729 sabotage and theft cases have been cracked. According to statistics from six major cities including Beijing and Tianjin, 4,274 cases of disrupting financial order and 8,156 cases of opium and drug offences were cracked during the year. The people's police of public security organs at all levels have played a huge role in cracking the above-mentioned cases, making the various security cases decrease day by day. Taking the robbery cases that occurred in the four cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing as an example, 210 cases occurred in January, while only 54 cases occurred in October, a decrease of 73%, making the social order increasingly stable. Urban security work such as household registration, transportation, security, and fire prevention has also gradually explored and accumulated a relatively complete set of experiences. In terms of rural security, the People's Public Security Organs cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in the newly liberated areas to剿灭 (jiǎomiè - suppress) bandits, basically eliminating a large number of bandit gangs, and crushing the enemy's conspiracy to instigate so-called "guerrilla warfare." The remaining bandits must continue to be清剿 (qīngjiǎo - suppressed) and eradicated. In addition, in key sectors of financial and economic enterprises throughout the country, a mass force for preventing traitors and eliminating special agents has begun to be established to protect production and construction. In accordance with the principle of combining security organizations with the broad masses of employees, and combining security work with production, economic security work has been universally carried out. In the past year, many destructive accidents have been reduced or avoided, giving a serious打击 (dǎjī - attack) to the enemy's so-called "key sabotage" conspiracy. Some areas have also carried out or are carrying out the registration of reactionary party and团 (tuán - league) members and the ban on reactionary secret societies, and have achieved great results. Facts have proved that the People's Public Security Organs have sufficient strength to overcome any counter-revolutionary conspiracy of sabotage. All counter-revolutionary elements who dare to continue to be enemies of the people, if they do not repent and stop all sabotage activities, will certainly not be able to escape the severe punishment given by the people.

The main shortcoming of the People's Public Security Organs over the past year is the right-leaning deviation in dealing with counter-revolutionary elements. This deviation has occurred to varying degrees in many areas of the country, and has continued for more than half a year. It is manifested in the fact that although many cases have been solved, the suppression of those who are guilty of heinous crimes and refuse to repent is not enough; it is manifested in the fact that some are given light sentences for serious crimes, are detained for a long time without being questioned, and even if there is suppression, it is not timely, and because the suppression is not enough and not timely, it forms the situation that they are released here and commit crimes there, they are released today and commit crimes tomorrow. Even in individual areas, there are cases of "four arrests and four releases" and "eight captures and eight releases" of captured bandits, and the bandits and special agents re-commit evil after being easily released, killing the people, which has aroused public dissatisfaction and resentment against the government's "boundless leniency and no law." It not only damaged the enthusiasm of the people to fight against the enemy, but also fueled the arrogance of counter-revolutionary elements. However, since the State Council and the Supreme People's Court issued the "Instructions on Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Activities" in July, and Premier Zhou's report "Strive to Consolidate and Develop the Victory of the People" on National Day severely criticized this "boundless leniency" deviation, various places have conducted serious inspections on this and put forward methods to correct this deviation. Therefore, there has been an initial correction at present. The people see that the government is determined to suppress bad people, protect good people, and eliminate harm for the people, so they express more enthusiastic and active support for the government, greatly improving the enthusiasm of the masses in preventing traitors and fighting against special agents, and they clap their hands and say: "It should have been done this way long ago," "The leniency policy of the People's Government is not without limits." Some counter-revolutionary elements are also awed by the powerful power of the people's regime, and some have begun to voluntarily confess to our People's Public Security Organs and register meritorious deeds to redeem themselves. In addition, some have temporarily disappeared and dare not carry out large-scale activities, or they cunningly disguise themselves in an attempt to escape the people's net, or they turn to more covert and more vicious sabotage activities. From here, it is further proved that only by severely suppressing the main counter-revolutionary elements can counter-revolutionaries be made to fear, strive for and reform accomplices, and eliminate counter-revolutionary activities. Only in this way can we better protect the interests of the people and meet the requirements of the broad masses of the people.

However, although the right-leaning deviation in suppressing counter-revolutionary activities has been initially corrected in various parts of the country, it has not yet been thoroughly corrected. Moreover, the enemy will never be reconciled to failure after suffering a serious打击 (dǎjī - attack) from us. Any counter-revolution will never automatically withdraw from the anti-people front. Many historical experiences have proved that the closer the enemy is to final death, the more intense its desperate struggle will be. In the current situation where US imperialism is invading Korea, invading our country, and continuing to expand the war of aggression, they will continue to arrogantly fantasize about the so-called "time has come" and will become rampant. And no matter how the situation changes, one thing is always certain, that is, US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang are determined to be enemies of the Chinese people, and they will never relax their conspiracy to sabotage the Chinese people for a moment. Especially today, the main enemy we are facing is not only the small group of Chiang bandit special agents remnants who fled to Taiwan, but the evil, cunning, and more experienced in secret sabotage imperialism, especially US imperialism. Therefore, the struggle against traitors and the elimination of special agents in the future will inevitably become a more covert, more complex, more acute, and more intense struggle. In this regard, any paralysis of thought and carelessness are extremely harmful. Chairman Mao has repeatedly warned us: "The whole party and the people of the whole country must be vigilant against the conspiratorial activities of counter-revolutionary elements!" With vigilance, our minds will be clear and our eyes will be bright. No matter what conspiracy and sabotage activities the US-Chiang special agent spies engage in, under the vigilant gaze of hundreds of millions of people, "ten eyes see, ten hands point," they will inevitably reveal their true colors and will not escape the net of the law. With vigilance, we can defeat the enemy. "Eliminating paralysis and raising vigilance" is an important guarantee for us to achieve victory in the struggle against traitors in the past and to continue to achieve victory in the future.

In 1950, we had already begun to win a great victory in the struggle against traitors. In the new 1951, our task will be to further strengthen the people's public security work under the general policy of consolidating national defense, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and consolidating the national financial and economic situation, to continue to severely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and to fight to eliminate all conspiracies and sabotage activities instigated by US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. To this end, it is necessary to: completely and accurately implement the policy of "combining suppression with leniency" as instructed by Chairman Mao, that is: "The ringleaders must be punished, the accomplices will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded," which cannot be abandoned. Thoroughly correct the right-leaning deviation of "boundless leniency"; at the same time, we must also adopt a cautious attitude and insist on opposing and resolutely preventing the occurrence of the left-leaning deviation of indiscriminate arrest and killing. Suppress counter-revolutionary activities in a more planned and orderly manner in accordance with the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionary Elements" promulgated by the State Council. We must strengthen economic security work to ensure that no serious accidents occur in all important factories, mines, warehouses, water sources, power key departments, safeguard the safety of railway bridge transportation, strengthen the specialized security work and mass safety organizations of various economic construction departments, and crush the enemy's conspiracy to sabotage our economic construction. We must strengthen border defense security work. At present, the US-Chiang bandit gang is constantly harassing our sea and land border defenses in coordination with its war of aggression, and sending special agents and bandits from Taiwan and Hong Kong to infiltrate into the mainland secretly. There have been many cases where the enemy's conspiracy has been discovered, cracked, and annihilated by us. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and effectively strengthen border defense security work, strictly prevent enemy special agents from harassing and sabotaging, and protect the safety of our country's border gates. We must strengthen the construction of the people's police and the people's public security armed forces. For the people's police, we must educate and transform the old components, absorb and supplement new components, open police cadre and police schools, and gradually realize the construction of a people's police force that is politically reliable, organizationally pure, and wholeheartedly serves the people in a certain period of time in the future. For the people's public security forces, under the unified command of the Public Security Headquarters of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, it is necessary to strengthen management education and military and political training, and gradually improve their equipment, enrich their personnel and cadres, improve their combat effectiveness and service business capabilities, and build a strong people's public security armed force. In order to adapt to the requirements of undertaking nationwide internal defense tasks.

In order to complete the new glorious tasks of the people's public security work, our public security personnel at all levels, the commanders and fighters of the people's public security forces, and the people's police must further strengthen our study. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "This study is very important. If the revolutionary people do not learn this method of ruling the counter-revolutionary classes, they will not be able to maintain their power, and their power will be overthrown by internal and external reactionaries." It can be seen from this that study is a serious political task for us. Therefore, we must take our study one step further, and thereby take our people's public security work and our democratic dictatorship work one step further. We must be determined to learn the theoretical knowledge and skills of concealed struggle. We must be determined to improve our policy level and master public security business. We must learn to investigate and research, constantly conduct public and secret investigation and research work, so as to find out the enemy's situation at any time, investigate thoroughly, hit the key points, and defeat the enemy. On the basis of rectification and cadre management, we will improve our work style, improve work efficiency, further strengthen ties with the people, and truly combine open work with secret work, combine specialized agencies with the mass anti-traitor movement, and strive for greater victories in eliminating the anti-revolutionary activities of the US-Chiang special agent bandit gang, ensuring the smooth implementation of land reform and production and construction, and coordinating with the great just patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea of the Chinese people.

　　一年来人民公安工作的成就和今后任务
    罗瑞卿
    一年来各级公安机关在中央人民政府与毛主席的英明领导下，坚决执行了人民政协共同纲领中关于镇压反革命活动的方针，在全国范围内开始建立了一支坚强的人民公安工作的队伍，有力地打击了与美帝扩大侵略战争相呼应的土匪特务的活动，保卫了生产建设与人民的安全，镇压了国内外反革命的一切破坏阴谋，建立与巩固了新区和老区的城乡革命秩序，配合人民解放军保卫了国防，巩固着人民民主专政。
    如所周知帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派，是以豢养大批特务作为维持其统治的重要支柱之一的。当它的公开的力量被消灭之后，经过最初一段时间的慌乱，在美帝国主义指使下，重整了它原有的特务组织，并重新训练了一批新的特务间谍分子，隐蔽地积极从事各种破坏活动。但我全体公安人员发挥了高度的积极性，加以广大人民之积极协助，不断给予了潜藏的敌人以有力打击。今年一月至十月全国共破获重大特务案六六四件，破获国际间谍案九件，捕获特务一三八一二人（内有组长、支队长以上重要特务分子一○七八人），并对一部分罪大恶极，怙恶不悛的反革命分子给予了严厉镇压——判处死刑或长期徒刑。对于那些罪不至死尚可改造教育的特务分子，进行了拘押和强迫劳动，给以改造自新的机会。对于一般参加反革命活动的胁从分子，分别进行了一定时期的管制，其中许多确有改悔的则已经解除了对他们的管制。一年来的经验证明，对待反革命分子只有正确实行“镇压与宽大相结合”的方针，才能更有效地打击反革命活动。在城市管理上，由于国民党在其长期反动统治中，专事制造穷困，致使大批人口失去生活依据，流落城乡，沦为盗匪，危害社会治安。特别是在新解放城市中，盗匪活动，曾相当严重地影响了城市治安。但经人民公安机关一年来的努力，这些盗匪已被基本肃清。少数屡诫不改的惯匪惯盗和其中的特务分子，已受到应有的惩处；大部已在劳动改造中成为新人，或正在进行劳动改造。仅据北京、天津、上海、南京、广州、重庆等十二个较大城市的统计，破获强盗案达二一九七起，破坏盗窃案三一七二九起。另据北京、天津等六大城市的统计，年来破获扰乱金融案四二七四起，烟毒案八一五六起。各级公安机关的人民警察在破获上述案件中发挥了巨大的作用，使各项危害治安案件日渐减少。以北京、天津、上海、南京四市所发生的强盗案为例，一月份发生二一○件，十月份则仅发生五四件，较前减少百分之七三，使社会秩序日益稳定。户籍、交通、警卫、消防等项城市治安工作，也逐渐摸索与积累了一套比较完整的经验。在乡村治安方面，人民公安机关配合了人民解放军在新区剿灭土匪，基本肃清了大批股匪，粉碎了敌人策动所谓“游击”的阴谋。现残匪还须继续清剿，予以根绝。此外，在全国各地财经企业重要部门中，为了保卫生产建设，已开始建立了一支防奸反特的群众队伍。按照保卫机构与广大员工相结合、保卫工作与生产相结合的原则，普遍开展了经济保卫工作。一年以来已经减少或避免了不少破坏事故，给予敌特所谓“重点破坏”的阴谋以严重的打击。有些地区还进行了或正在进行着反动党团分子的登记工作及取缔反动会道门的工作，并已取得很大成绩。事实证明：人民公安机关是有充分力量足以战胜任何反革命的阴谋破坏活动的。一切胆敢继续与人民为敌的反革命分子，如不翻然悔悟，停止一切破坏活动，都一定不能逃避人民所给予的严惩。
    一年来人民公安机关的缺点，主要的是在对待反革命分子问题上存有右倾偏向。这种偏向曾在全国许多地区不同程度地普遍地发生过，而且时间继续了大半年。它表现在有的破案虽多，但对罪大恶极、怙恶不悛的分子镇压不够；它表现在有的重罪轻判，久押不问，虽有镇压亦不及时，并由于镇压不够和不及时而形成此地释放，彼处作案，今日释放，明日作案，甚至个别地区对俘获之土匪有“四捉四放”以及“八擒八纵”的，匪特被轻易释放后重新作恶，杀害人民，因而引起了群众不满，瞒怨政府“宽大无边、有天无法”，既损害了人民群众对敌斗争的积极性，也助长了反革命分子的气焰。但自七月间政务院与最高人民法院发布了《关于镇压反革命活动的指示》，国庆节周总理《为巩固和发展人民的胜利而奋斗》的报告中，又对这种“宽大无边”的偏向，作了严肃的批判，各地对此已经进行了认真的检查，并提出了纠正这一偏向的办法，因而目前已经有了初步纠正。人民群众看到政府决心镇压坏人，保护好人，为民除害，因而表示更热情的积极的拥护政府，大大提高了群众防奸反特斗争的积极性，纷纷拍手称快，他们说：“早就该这么办了”，“人民政府的宽大政策不是没边没岸的”。一部分反革命分子也慑于人民政权的强大威力，而有所醒悟，有的并已开始自动向我人民公安机关坦白登记立功自赎。此外，有的暂时消声匿迹不敢大肆活动，或则狡滑伪装企图逃脱人民的法网，或则转入更加隐蔽更加恶毒的破坏活动。从这里更进一步的证明了只有严厉地镇压反革命首要分子，才能使反革命知所畏惧，争取与改造胁从分子，肃清反革命活动。也只有如此，才能更好的保卫人民利益，符合于广大人民群众的要求。
    但是，目前全国各地对于镇压反革命活动中的右倾偏向虽然已经有了初步纠正，却尚未彻底的纠正。而且敌人遭我严重打击之后，也绝不会甘心失败的，任何反革命是绝不会自动退出反人民的阵地的，多少历史经验证明，敌人愈是接近最后死亡，其拼命挣扎亦愈强烈。在目前美帝侵略朝鲜、侵略我国、并继续扩大侵略战争的形势下，他们还会不断的狂妄的幻想所谓“时机已到”，还会猖狂起来。而且不论形势变化如何，有一条总是可以肯定的，即是美帝国主义及蒋介石残余匪帮是决心与中国人民为敌的，他们对中国人民的破坏阴谋是一刻也不会放松的。尤其是今天我们所面对的主要敌人，已经不仅仅是败逃在台湾一隅的那一小撮撮蒋匪特务残余，而是万恶、狡猾、较有秘密破坏经验的帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义。所以今后的反奸肃特斗争，必然会成为更隐蔽，更复杂，更尖锐，更剧烈的斗争。在这一点上任何麻痹思想、疏忽大意都是极为有害的，毛主席曾一再告诫我们：“全党和全国人民对于反革命分子的阴谋活动，必须提高警惕！”有了警惕，我们的头脑就会清醒，眼睛就会明亮，不管美蒋特务间谍分子的任何阴谋破坏活动，在我亿万人民群众“十目所视，十手所指”的警觉注视下，必然会原形毕露，难逃法网。有了警惕，我们就能战胜敌人。“消灭麻痹，提高警惕”，是我们过去取得反奸斗争胜利也是今后继续取得胜利的重要保证。
    在一九五○年我们已经开始赢得了反奸斗争的巨大胜利，在新的一九五一年我们的任务将是：在总的巩固国防、巩固人民民主专政、巩固国家财政经济的总方针下进一步加强人民公安工作，继续严厉镇压反革命活动，并为肃清美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮所策动的一切阴谋破坏活动而斗争。为此必须：完全准确地执行毛主席所指示的“镇压与宽大相结合”的政策，即是：“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”不可偏废的政策，彻底纠正“宽大无边”的右倾偏向；同时也要采取谨慎态度，坚持反对与坚决防止乱捕乱杀左的偏向的发生。依照政务院所颁布的《惩治反革命条例》更有计划、有秩序地镇压反革命活动。必须加强经济保卫工作，保障一切重要厂矿、仓库、水源、动力要害部门不发生严重事故，卫护铁道桥梁交通运输的安全，强化各经济建设部门的专门保卫工作与群众安全组织，粉碎敌人对我经济建设上的一切破坏阴谋。必须加强边防保卫工作，目前美蒋匪帮配合其侵略战争不断侵扰我海陆边防，并自台、港派遣特务匪徒偷偷向大陆渗透挤入，敌人这种阴谋行动为我发觉破获并立予歼灭者已有多起。因此必须迅速而有效地加强边防保卫工作，严防敌特袭扰破坏，保卫我国边疆门户的安全。必须加强人民警察与人民公安武装的建设工作，对于人民警察要教育改造旧成份，吸收补充新成份，开办警干、警察学校，逐渐实现在今后一定时期内建设一支政治上可靠、组织上纯洁，全心全意为人民服务的人民警察队伍；对于人民公安部队则须在人民革命军事委员会公安司令部统一指挥下，加强管理教育与军政训练，并逐步改善其装备，充实其兵员、干部，提高其战斗力与勤务业务能力，建设一支强大的人民公安武装。以适应担负全国规模的内防任务的要求。
    为了完成人民公安工作新的光荣任务，我各级公安机关全体公安人员、人民公安部队、人民警察的指战员同志们，更必须进一步加强我们的学习。毛主席在论人民民主专政一文中曾谆谆教导我们：“这个学习很要紧。革命的人民如果不学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法，他们就不能维持政权，他们的政权就会被内外反动派所推翻。”由此可见学习对于我们来说，是一个严重的政治任务。因此我们必须把学习提高一步，并从而将我们的人民公安工作，将我们的民主专政工作提高一步。我们要决心学会隐蔽斗争的理论知识与技能。要决心提高政策水平，精通公安业务。要学会调查研究，不断地进行公开的与秘密的调查研究工作，以达到随时摸清敌情，深入明察，击中要害，战胜敌人。并在整风整干基础之上，改进我们的工作作风，提高工作效率，进一步密切与人民群众的联系，确切的做到公开工作与秘密工作相结合，专门机关与广大群众的防奸运动相结合，为肃清美蒋特务匪帮反革命活动，为保证土地改革和生产建设的顺利进行，为配合全中国人民轰轰烈烈的伟大正义的抗美援朝爱国运动争取更大胜利而奋斗。
