　　In order to consolidate and expand the anti-American patriotic united front, various democratic parties are implementing two major resolutions, launching the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, and consolidating and developing organizations.
[Report from this newspaper] The local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers’ Democratic Party, and the Jiusan Society are now actively carrying out their work in accordance with the resolutions of the central meetings held in Beijing successively from November to December last year by various democratic parties.
Local organizations have conveyed and discussed the meeting resolutions. The content of the transmission mainly falls into two parts: First, actively launch the sacred movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country; second, reorganize and consolidate the organization in order to develop it. The local organizations of the various democratic parties expressed their warm support for the resolutions on these two major tasks and are determined to work hard to achieve them. When conveying the resolution to Tianjin members, Li Zhuchen of the China National Democratic Construction Association said: "The development of industry and commerce is related to the prosperity of the country, and our China National Democratic Construction Association must shoulder this important task." When Xiao Junying of the South China Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang conveyed the central resolution of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang at a forum for democratic parties and non-party democratic figures in Guangzhou, he said: "We must strive to learn from Sun Yat-sen's spirit of being able to adapt to the trends of the world, resolutely turn to the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, stop the imperialist war of aggression, and defend world peace; and the current specific task is to Resist America, Aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country." When Liang Ruochen of the China Democratic League conveyed the resolution to League members in Guangzhou, he also said: "In order to achieve the general task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, we must mobilize all League members to fight for consolidating national defense, resisting American imperialist aggression, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidating finance and the economy, and consolidating the cultural and ideological front."
Recently, the local organizations of various democratic parties have achieved new results in implementing their respective central resolutions. In order to implement the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has formulated detailed implementation plans, determined to conduct practical and effective agitation and propaganda among the masses it is connected with, strengthen ideological education on patriotism and internationalism, and organize studies. The local organizations of the China Democratic League have held various forums to expose the crimes of American imperialism in order to eliminate thoughts of fearing, being pro-, and worshiping America. The Chongqing branch held seven forums for middle school teachers and six forums for elementary school teachers; the Wuhan branch held forums for principals and student representatives of various schools, calling on young people to sign up for military cadre schools. In Hubei Province, League members mobilized 43 of their children to participate in military cadre schools. League member Cai Xinlin had six children, five of whom died during the Anti-Japanese War, and the only remaining daughter was also sent to sign up for military cadre school. The China National Democratic Construction Association promoted the signature campaign for patriotic covenants in the business community across the country. In Chongqing, the China National Democratic Construction Association also promoted mutual supervision of the implementation of patriotic covenants among the city's business community. During the anti-American and aid-Korea demonstrations held by the business community in various places, members of the China National Democratic Construction Association also played a leading role. The China Association for Promoting Democracy and the Jiusan Society invited responsible persons and students from church schools in various places to hold forums against American cultural aggression in order to cooperate with the implementation of the State Council's decision.
In the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, the local organizations of various democratic parties have actively donated condolences, collected condolence letters, mobilized young people to participate in military cadre schools, and assisted the government in implementing land reform, and have achieved certain results.
In terms of consolidating and developing organizations, the local organizations of various democratic parties have also done a lot of work. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is now actively consolidating its organization, improving the political understanding of its members, transforming its ideological style, and striving to win over and absorb former Kuomintang members who perform well among in-service civil servants to participate in the organization. The China Democratic League has made significant achievements in developing its organization. For example, Wuhu City originally had no League organization. Through the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, it has developed from thirteen League members to fifty-nine League members and has officially established a branch. At the same time, necessary punishments were given to some League members who violated the League's charter and betrayed the people's stand. For example, the Chongqing branch expelled League members Huang Daomei and Lin Ya, who were landlords by origin and oppressed farmers and undermined rent reduction and interest reduction. The Provisional Working Committee of the Southwest General Branch issued instructions calling on League members to fight to maintain the purity of the China Democratic League organization. In terms of consolidating and developing its organization, the China National Democratic Construction Association has gradually expanded from winning over representative figures in the business community to uniting and winning over small and medium-sized industrialists and business employees to participate in the organization, and the number of members has increased significantly in various places. The China Association for Promoting Democracy and the Jiusan Society are also actively carrying out the consolidation and development of their organizations.

　　为巩固与扩大反美爱国统一战线
    各民主党派正贯彻两大决议
    开展抗美援朝运动与巩固发展组织
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、民主建国会、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党和九三学社的各地组织，现正根据去年十一月至十二月各民主党派先后在北京召开的中央会议的决议，积极展开工作。
    各地组织均按照会议决议进行了传达和讨论。传达内容主要分两大部分：一，积极开展神圣的抗美援朝保家卫国运动；二，整理与巩固组织，以便发展组织。对于这两大任务的决议，各民主党派的各地组织表示了热烈的拥护，并决心为实现这两大任务而努力。民主建国会李烛尘在传达决议时对天津会员说：“工商业的发展，关系国家的富强，我们民主建国会要担负起这项重任。”中国国民党革命委员会华南临工会萧隽英在广州市各民主党派及无党派民主人士座谈会上传达民革中央决议，他说：“我们要努力学习孙中山先生能够适应世界潮流的精神，坚决地倒向以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，制止帝国主义的侵略战争，保卫世界和平；而当前的具体任务就是抗美援朝保家卫国。”中国民主同盟梁若尘向广州盟员传达决议时也说：“为了实现抗美援朝保家卫国的总任务，要动员全体盟员为巩固国防、抵抗美帝国主义侵略、巩固人民民主专政、巩固财政经济、巩固文化思想战线而斗争。”
    最近，各民主党派的各地组织在执行各自中央决议中已有了新的成绩。为实行抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务，中国国民党革命委员会中央常委会又拟定了详细的实施方案，确定对其所联系的群众进行切实而有效的鼓动宣传，加强爱国主义与国际主义的思想教育，并组织了学习。中国民主同盟的各地组织召开了各种座谈会，揭露美帝国主义的罪恶，借以肃清恐美、亲美、崇美思想。重庆市支部召开了七次中学教职员座谈会和六次小学教职员座谈会；武汉市支部举行了各校校长和学生代表的座谈会，号召青年报名参加军事干部学校。湖北省支部盟员动员自己子女参加军事干部学校的达四十三人。盟员蔡心琳有六个孩子，抗日时期死去五个，仅剩下一个女儿，也送她报名参加了军事干部学校。民主建国会则推动各地工商界举行爱国公约签名运动。在重庆，民主建国会并推动全市工商界互相监督执行爱国公约。在各地工商界举行抗美援朝示威大游行时，民主建国会会员也起了带头的作用。中国民主促进会和九三学社邀集各地教会学校的负责人和学生，举行了反对美帝文化侵略的座谈会，以配合政务院决定的执行。
    各民主党派的各地组织在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，均积极捐献慰劳品，征集慰问信，动员青年参加军事干部学校和协助政府实行土地改革，并获得了一定成绩。
    在巩固和发展组织方面，各民主党派的各地组织也做了不少工作。中国国民党革命委员会现正积极巩固组织，提高党员的政治认识，改造思想作风，并争取和吸取在职公务人员中表现好的旧国民党员参加组织。中国民主同盟在发展组织上，已有显著成绩。如芜湖市原来没有盟的组织，经过抗美援朝保家卫国运动，已从十三个盟员发展至五十九个盟员，并正式成立了分部。同时，对于有些违犯盟章，背叛人民立场的盟员，给予了必要的处分。如重庆支部开除了欺压农民、破坏减租减息的地主出身的盟员黄道美和林雅。西南总支部临时工作委员会则发出指示，号召盟员为保持中国民主同盟组织的纯洁性而斗争。民主建国会在巩固与发展组织方面，已由争取工商界代表性人士逐渐扩大到团结和争取中、小工商业者及工商从业人员参加组织，现各地会员已有显著增加。中国民主促进会和九三学社对于巩固和发展组织，也正开始积极进行中。
