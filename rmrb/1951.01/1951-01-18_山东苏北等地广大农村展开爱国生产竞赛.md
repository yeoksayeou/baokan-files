Xinhua News Agency report: A patriotic production competition movement is beginning in the vast rural areas of Shandong and northern Jiangsu. This competition movement was initiated and promoted by labor models after the local farmers underwent current affairs study. Their slogan is to intensify winter production and strengthen national defense forces, taking practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

Zhang Fugui and Yu Qingshou, two labor models from Shandong Province, first initiated a production competition with seven labor models from Wendeng County, guaranteeing the completion of winter plowing and accumulating over a hundred carts of fertilizer, which immediately received an enthusiastic response. Subsequently, Lü Hongbin, a labor model from Junan County, also led the farmers in his village to join the competition. In addition to contributing over 23,400 jin of grain to start small-scale water conservancy projects, the 22 households in the village guaranteed that the entire village would accumulate 1,200 carts of manure before spring planting. As a result, farmers in various counties of the Wendeng Special District launched a "Three Piles" (earth piles, manure piles, grass piles) movement. In Xiwoweitou Village, Haiyang County, every farmer's household had high piles of earth and manure in front of their doors. Farmer Xu Changyu of the village guaranteed to accumulate 80 loads of fertilizer this winter. He happily said, "I will turn these piles of manure, piles of earth, and piles of grass into piles of wheat, piles of sweet potatoes, and piles of peanuts next year."

In northern Jiangsu, labor model Gao Wanlong not only completed wheat planting in a timely manner but also educated and helped the lazy man Zhang Xiancheng to plant wheat on time. Excavation model Wang Daqiao led his team of ten people to participate in the Liutang River dredging project, resolutely overcoming difficulties such as deep ponds and cold water, excavating 3.2 cubic meters of earth per person per day, thus winning the title of county-level pond repair model. Another labor model, Ni Huailin, led his team of 42 people to participate in the excavation of the Xihu River, and completed the task assigned to them in just twelve days of intensive labor, and was rated as a model team of the entire corps. Now Ni Huailin is leading the farmers in his team to engage in a winter sideline production competition.

[This newspaper report] The patriotic production competition movement in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, has unfolded among the vast number of farmers in 102 villages. This patriotic production competition was proposed by Li Shunda and Zhang Zhiquan, well-known national labor models in Shanxi, with the goal of improving winter agricultural and sideline production and formulating agricultural production plans. Cadres and 148 farmers in Podi Village, Sixth District of our township, proposed "Using Production Achievements to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend Our Country." Within half a month, they have accumulated 1,900 dan of fertilizer, 39,560-odd jin of firewood and coal, and earned over 1.56 million yuan from sideline transportation. Yaoshanggou, a model production village in Wuxiang, led by labor model Wang Jinyun, all 27 mutual aid teams have responded to Li Shunda's challenge, earning 121 dan of rice from sideline production, directly preparing favorable conditions for agricultural production in 1951. Ninety-two laborers and thirty-one donkeys in Baijiazhuang Village earned 104 dan of rice from sideline production, newly purchased and repaired 72 pieces of farm implements, accumulated an average of 44 dan of fertilizer per mu, and accumulated more than 7 dan of coal per household. All party members in the village also said in a letter to Chairman Mao: "We must take the lead in further improving the patriotic winter production competition, ensure the completion of the plan, greet the great production of 1951, and increase national wealth as a gift to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country." In addition, 77 mutual aid teams throughout the county have formulated three-year agricultural production construction plans. The plans stipulate annual agricultural production increase targets, as well as methods for developing sideline occupations, adding livestock and farm implements, building houses, and improving lives.

　　山东苏北等地广大农村展开爱国生产竞赛
    【新华社讯】一个爱国主义的生产竞赛运动，正在山东、苏北广大农村中开始。这个竞赛运动是在当地农民们进行了时事学习之后，由劳动模范们带头并推动起来的。他们的口号是加紧冬季生产，加强国防力量，以实际行动来进行抗美援朝、保家卫国。
    山东省劳动模范张富贵和于青绶二人首先以保证完成冬耕和积肥百余车等条件，向文登县的七个劳动模范发起了生产竞赛，并立即得到热烈的响应。接着，莒南县的劳动模范吕洪斌也领导着全村农民投入竞赛。该村二十二户农民除拿出两万三千四百余斤粮食开办小型水利事业外，并保证全村在春种前积粪一千二百车。影响所及，文登专区各县农民更展开了“三大堆”（土堆、粪堆、草堆）运动。海阳县西苇园头村每个农户门前，都堆着高高的土堆和粪堆。该村农民徐长玉保证今冬积肥八十驮。他高兴地说：“我要把这粪一堆、土一堆、草一堆，到明年变成麦子一堆、地瓜一堆、花生一堆。”
    苏北劳动模范高万龙除自己及时完成种麦外，并教育和帮助懒汉张贤成按时种上麦子。挖河模范王大锹带领全组十个人参加六塘河疏浚工程，坚决克服了塘深、水冷等困难，每人每天挖土达三点二公方，因而荣获全县修塘模范的称号。另一劳动模范倪怀林领导全组四十二人参加开凿西湖河的工程，以十二天的紧张劳动，首先完成了分配给他们的任务，被评为全总队的模范组。现倪怀林又领导该小组的农民投入冬季副业生产的竞赛运动。
    【本报讯】山西武乡县的爱国主义生产竞赛运动，已在一百零二个村庄的广大农民中展开。这次爱国主义生产竞赛，是由山西全国著名劳动模范李顺达、张志全等提出来的，以搞好冬季农副业生产和订好农业生产计划为竞赛目标。我乡六区坡底村干部和农民一百四十八人，提出“拿生产成果抗美援朝保家卫国”，已在半月内积肥一千九百担，积柴、运煤三万九千五百六十余斤，副业运输赚洋一百五十六万余元。武乡生产模范村窑上沟，在劳动模范王锦云带领下，二十七个互助组都向李顺达应了战，已从副业生产赚米一百二十一担，直接为一九五一年的农业生产准备了良好的条件。白家庄村九十二个劳动力，三十一头毛驴，副业生产赚米一百零四担，已新置和修补农具七十二件，积肥每亩已达四十四担，积煤每户已达七担多。该村全体党员并在给毛主席的信里说：“我们要带头把爱国主义冬季生产竞赛再提高一步，保证完成计划，迎接一九五一年大生产，多增加国家财富作为给抗美援朝保家卫国的献礼。”此外全县已有七十七个互助组，制订了三年农业生产建设计划。计划内规定了每年农业增产的目标，以及发展副业，添置牲畜、农具，修建房屋，改善生活的办法。
