　　Another Atrocity by the American and Japanese Reactionaries
    Persecution of the Japan-China Friendship Association
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Tokyo News: The Japan-China Friendship Association, which aims to promote friendship between the people of China and Japan, has been illegally persecuted by the American and Japanese reactionaries. At 9:00 AM on December 31st of last year, the Special Investigation Bureau of the Yoshida government, acting on the orders of a judge of the First Military Court of the U.S. Eighth Army in Osaka, dispatched approximately 30 armed plainclothes agents to illegally break into the Japan-China Friendship Association and the General Association of Chinese Students in Japan in Tokyo. They conducted wanton searches, seizing multiple copies of "People's Daily" and "World Knowledge" and other newspapers and periodicals stored by the association. At the same time, Akatsu Masuzo, the head of the Research and Information Department of the Japan-China Friendship Association, was also illegally arrested. Prior to this, the Osaka police had also illegally searched the Osaka branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association and arrested Hirai Inosuke, the secretary of the branch, and another staff member, Yamaguchi Kazuko. On December 29th, the U.S. Military Court in Osaka unreasonably sentenced Hirai to three years of forced labor and Yamaguchi to six months of forced labor, and arrested Ozawa Masamoto, the secretary-general of the Japan-China Friendship Association, who testified in court for the innocent defendants. It is reported that the U.S. Military Court also intends to unreasonably interrogate Akatsu Masuzo.
