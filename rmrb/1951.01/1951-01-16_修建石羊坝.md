    Building the Shiyang Dam
    Li Renyi
    Along the thousand-mile-long Huai River, millions of working people are selflessly working for the water conservancy construction of New China. Extraordinary model examples are emerging at every construction site. The Shiyang Dam project in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, is one of thousands of such examples.
    On the eighteen-mile-long dam of Shiyang, over ten thousand male and female laborers are moving back and forth, and the songs of labor are shaking the nearby villages and valleys. When the rooster crows in the morning, the laborers living in the villages near the dam set out to build the dam, working until eight or nine o'clock in the evening. Although the biting north wind is cold and the hard loess is difficult to dig, they cannot overcome the fiery hearts of the laborers: every shovel is polished brightly, every basket of soil weighs between 150 and 200 jin, and the slogan "Work harder and strive for the red flag" can be heard everywhere. Those digging soil wish they could dig a basket with one shovel; those carrying soil always want to cross to the top of the dam in two steps; those tamping are so energetic that the dam body vibrates when the pestle falls. Among the twenty-three young laborers in the first team of the fourth team, seventeen have been awarded the flag by the brigade for their excellent work. Shao, a mute man in the second squad, was not willing to lag behind. He used his hands to gesture to fill the basket and compete with them. Hou Guangyin, the forty-six-year-old squad leader, took the lead in leading everyone to work actively. The old cotton-padded jacket he wore when he came has now been rubbed by the carrying pole, revealing large pieces of white cotton on both shoulders. The Hu Changren model squad is united and strong. The youngest is twenty-one years old, and the oldest is only thirty-six years old. They are the main force of the entire team. They work together, rest together, and eat together. They dug 512 cubic meters of soil in twelve and a half days. After deducting food expenses from their wages, the whole squad still had more than 300 jin of rice left over. They were praised by the brigade and each received a new shirt as a reward.
    Shiyang Dam is the second line of defense in Huaiyuan County, northern Anhui, that blocks the Huai River, protecting a large number of villages and fertile fields. Historically, the people south and north of the dam had countless disputes: whenever the Huai River rose, the people south of the dam would break the dam to release water, and the people north of the dam would build the dam to prevent floods, sometimes even engaging in fierce armed fights. However, in the past, the reactionary ruling class did not have the determination and overall plan to fundamentally control the Huai River, so the interests of the south and north of the dam could never be unified.
    But now, after Chairman Mao's instructions on fundamentally controlling the Huai River and the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on governing the Huai River were announced, the people along the Huai River have gained new hope and increased their confidence in the construction prospects of New China. They saw that the construction of the Shiyang Dam was not being carried out in isolation. In addition to the construction of the Shiyang Dam, Huaiyuan County is also simultaneously carrying out the breaching and restoration projects of dikes such as the Huai Dike and the Wo River Dike. In particular, a waist dike will be built along Jingshan Lake from the Yellow River estuary to Yongpinggang, which can ensure that the uplands south of the Shiyang Dam will not be flooded even under high water levels. This measure to fundamentally control the Huai River has solved the decades-long dispute between the north and south of the Shiyang Dam. Under common interests, the people south of the dam automatically contributed their strength, as the laborer Lu Hongfu said: "Everyone shares the blessings. The hearts of the people south and north of the dam are linked together!"
    The beautiful prospect of fundamentally controlling the Huai River is beckoning to every laborer, encouraging them to work actively for the permanent happiness of their descendants. These proverbs are popular in the middle reaches of the Huai River: "If the Dahewan is harvested, half the sky will be rich; if the Dahewan is not harvested for three years, the quilt will be turned into pants." Dahewan is located in the Jingshan Lake area southeast of Shiyang Dam. Since Chiang Kai-shek's bandits broke the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou in 1938, the rolling Yellow River water has flooded the fertile fields hundreds of miles away near Dahewan, causing the people in this area to not have a good harvest for ten years. The local people love this piece of land and never forget the scene in the past when one mu of land could harvest more than 200 jin of wheat. Now this beautiful picture is about to reappear in front of the people: after the waist dike from the Yellow River estuary to Yongpinggang is built, Dahewan will be able to harvest at least one season of wheat every year, and rice can be planted at low water levels. The cultivated area and harvest volume of Dahewan account for one-third of the entire Huaiyuan County. If there is a bumper harvest in one year, it can provide food for 580,000 people in the entire county for two years. The long-cherished wish of the farmers has finally been realized. Wang Houqing, a carpenter from Wangjiazhuang north of the dam, said with gratitude: "The lawsuit of Shiyang Dam has been fought from the late Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China. The sufferers are still our common people. The Central People's Government has only been established for one year, and it has done such an amazing thing. Chairman Mao is really the great benefactor of our sons and grandsons!"

### 修建石羊坝

　　修建石羊坝
　　李人怡
    在千里淮河线上，千百万劳动人民正在为新中国的水利建设而忘我地工作，每个工段上都出现了不平凡的模范事例，皖北怀远县石羊坝工程，便是千百个事例中的一个。
    在石羊坝十八里的大堤上，游动着一万多男女民工，劳动歌声震荡着附近的村庄和山谷。当早晨鸡叫时，住在大堤附近村庄的民工们便出发修堤了，一直干到晚上八九点钟。刺骨的朔风虽然寒冷，坚硬的黄土虽然难挖，但都战胜不过民工们火热的心：每一把铁锹都磨擦得雪亮，每一筐土都在一百五十斤至二百斤之间，到处都可听到“加油干，夺红旗”的口号。挖土的恨不得一锹挖一筐；抬土的总想两步跨到堤顶上；打硪的是那样的有劲，一硪落下来堤身都有些震动。民工四中队一分队二十三人中，有十七个年青的民工，由于工作成绩优异，荣获大队部奖旗。二班邵哑吧不甘落后，用手比划着把筐装满，也要和他们竞赛。四十六岁的民工分队长侯广银，积极带头领导大家干活，来时穿的一件旧棉袄，现在两个肩头上已被扁担磨擦得露出了大块白棉花。胡长仁模范班人齐力壮，最小的二十一岁，最大的不过三十六岁，是全中队的主力军，他们齐干活、齐休息、齐吃饭，十二天半挖了五百一十二方土，得的工资除去吃粮全班尚余三百多斤大米，受到大队部的表扬，每人并且得到了一件新单衣的奖励。
    石羊坝是皖北怀远县境阻挡淮水的第二道防线，这道防线护卫着大量的村庄和肥沃的田地。在历史上坝南和坝北的人民有着说不清的纠纷：每当淮水上涨，坝南人民要扒坝放水，坝北人民要打坝防洪，有时甚至进行剧烈的械斗。但过去反动统治阶级由于没有根治淮河的决心和通盘计划，所以坝南和坝北的利益始终统一不起来。
    但现在，毛主席关于根治淮河的指示及中央人民政府政务院关于治理淮河的决定传来后，沿淮人民都增添了新的希望，为新中国的建设远景增加了信心。他们看到石羊坝的修建不是孤立进行的，除去修建石羊坝之外，怀远县境同时进行淮堤、涡河堤等堤防的堵口复堤工程，特别是从黄河口至永平岗沿荆山湖将建筑一条腰堤，即在高水位下也可保证石羊坝以南的岗地不受水淹。这一根治淮河的措施，使石羊坝南北几十年来的纠纷迎刃而解。在共同的利益下，坝南人民自动的贡献了自己的力量，正如民工陆洪福说：“有福大家享，坝南坝北人民的心贴在一起了！”
    根治淮河的美好远景在向每个民工招手，在鼓励他们为子孙的永久幸福而积极工作。淮河中游流行着这几句谚语：“收了大河湾，富了半边天；三年不收大河湾，单被改成裤子穿。”大河湾就在石羊坝东南荆山湖一带。自从一九三八年蒋匪在花园口掘开黄河堤后，滚滚黄水淹没了大河湾附近百十里远的肥沃田地，使这一带的人民整整十年未好好收过粮食。当地人民疼爱这一片土地，始终忘不了过去这里一亩地能收二百多斤麦子的情景。现在这幅美丽的图景即将重现在人民面前：从黄河口至永平岗的腰堤筑成后，大河湾至少每年能收一季麦子，在低水位时能种水稻，大河湾的耕地面积和收获量占怀远全县三分之一，如有一年丰收，可供全县五十八万人两年的食粮，农民们多少年来的愿望终于实现。坝北王家庄木匠王厚卿感佩的说：“石羊坝的官司从前清一直打到民国时候，受害的还是咱老百姓，中央人民政府成立才一年，就办了这样惊人的大事情，毛主席真是咱们子子孙孙的大恩人！”
