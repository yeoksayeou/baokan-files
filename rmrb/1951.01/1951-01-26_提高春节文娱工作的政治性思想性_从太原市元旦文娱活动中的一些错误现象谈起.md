　　Improving the Political and Ideological Nature of Spring Festival Entertainment Work
    ——Starting from Some Erroneous Phenomena in the New Year's Day Entertainment Activities in Taiyuan City
    Li Qun
    Since the comprehensive liberation of Shanxi, along with the political and economic emancipation of the people of the province, there has also been a new look in cultural life. Judging from the first Spring Festival after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1950, the mass cultural activities throughout the province have made significant progress and have developed more universally and deeply. From cities to villages, there was a joyous sound of gongs and drums everywhere, and the people were singing praises of the leader Chairman Mao, the new China, their own liberation, and the great unity of the people of the whole country with abandon... Through various Spring Festival entertainment activities, production and construction were promoted, confidence in victory was consolidated, people were educated and entertained, creating a lively atmosphere and a new look for the entire province, demonstrating the era of the new people.

    The Spring Festival entertainment activities in the province in 1950, from cities to villages, were mostly led. The responsible authorities had better arrangements in advance and launched creations. In terms of the content of the Yangko activities: generally, they were in line with the political propaganda tasks at that time, promoting Sino-Soviet friendship, buying public bonds, etc.; past feudal superstitions and low-level interests were greatly reduced, and new content such as "cattle replacing plows," "planting cotton," "production carts," "liberating Hainan Island," and "fighting Taiwan" emerged one after another. In addition, the area of villages and personnel participating in Yangko activities was also very wide, and women also participated in this movement quite universally. Many places achieved self-writing and self-singing and organized competitions. In terms of form, it was also diverse, including Yangko, drama, stilts, carrying platforms, new land boats, martial arts, and magic lanterns. Because the mass entertainment activities of the Spring Festival in 1950 achieved considerable results in political propaganda, gained experience in organization and mobilization, and had many new creations in content and form, it laid a good foundation for the mass propaganda work and artistic work of the Spring Festival in the province in 1951.

    Our people's literature and art serve political tasks. "The central task of the Chinese people in 1951 should be to consolidate our great motherland with great efforts in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, so that imperialists and their running dogs have no possibility to undermine our great revolutionary cause and great construction cause." (People's Daily New Year's Day Editorial) To this end, in the Spring Festival entertainment movement in 1951, it should become the central content to deeply develop the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and strengthen patriotic and internationalist ideological education.

    How to continue to develop the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and patriotic and internationalist ideological education through Spring Festival entertainment activities, in order to "eradicate the political influence left by the long-term aggression of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, in China, and guide this ideological struggle into a climax of loving the motherland"? I think that in order to carry out this work very smoothly and achieve great results, first of all, the relevant leading organs in various places should conduct a more in-depth ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and patriotism and internationalism for the backbone members participating in the Spring Festival entertainment activities, help them to carry out collective creation, and carefully review their programs. Only when the backbone members participating in the Spring Festival entertainment activities have a correct understanding of current affairs and have been improved in political thought, can they carry out propaganda and education to the broad masses of people through various entertainment forms. The better they learn, the more likely their entertainment programs will have higher ideological and educational significance.

    Recently, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education of the Central Government issued instructions saying: "The Spring Festival of 1951 comes at a time when the patriotic enthusiasm of the people across the country is unprecedentedly high. Therefore, the content of Spring Festival propaganda should focus on reflecting the patriotic climax of the Chinese people from all aspects." We must organize the study of this instruction very well so that everyone participating in the Spring Festival entertainment activities understands it and accepts it.

    This year on New Year's Day, more than 90 entertainment groups in Taiyuan held a propaganda parade with more than 10,000 people. This parade forcefully demonstrated the strength of our Taiyuan mass cultural and artistic team. There were many creations in the entertainment programs, and the people of Taiyuan City were given ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, which had a considerable impact. However, in this parade, it was also seen that many of our backbone and actors participating in entertainment programs had a very poor understanding of current affairs and political studies, and the leadership review of entertainment programs was also very poor. For example, some units spent a lot of energy making a very large urinal, and the heads of three U.S. imperialist reactionaries appeared at the mouth of the urinal, moving around randomly. Presumably, the author's motive was to express hatred, contempt, and disdain for the U.S. imperialism, but the gain will not be great. Obviously, this low-level and vulgar work has no serious content. The attack on the enemy did not attack his vital point at all, because the urinal has nothing to do with the reactionary heads of the United States, and it cannot explain the aggressive nature and the future of failure of the United States, nor can it explain his internal and external contradictions. Therefore, it has no educational significance to the masses. We must clearly recognize that our entertainment programs are not for fun, not for making people laugh, but a serious job that should be political and combative, just as Mr. Lu Xun said in "Abuse and Intimidation are Never Fighting": We should "'joy, anger, and scolding, all become articles,' so that the enemy is injured or killed as a result, and we have no base behavior, and the audience does not think it is dirty, this is the skill of a fighting author." In our parade, in addition to the above situation, some people carried a large tortoise with "Yan Xishan" written on it. This approach is equivalent to scolding his parents, but it cannot reveal the reactionary nature of Yan Xishan as a traitor and cruel massacre of the people of Shanxi. This approach was also opposed by Mr. Lu Xun.

    Secondly, in our parade, there is also a phenomenon that the distinction between the enemy and ourselves is not clear, and the United States and its running dogs are participating in our Yangko team, which is inappropriate. Because the collective Yangko dance expresses the great unity of the Chinese people, and in our Chinese people's big family, the existence of the enemy cannot be allowed. Comrade Zhou Yang said in an article "Expressing the Era of the New Masses" published after watching the Yan'an Spring Festival Yangko in 1944: "Some comrades advocate that the image of workers, peasants, soldiers, and the masses of the people should be in the large Yangko dance, and clowns and villains should not be mixed in. The villains in the program either do not participate in the big dance, or put on makeup when performing. This proposition, I think, is correct. The large Yangko should be a collective dance of the people, a large chorus of the people."

    In the New Year's Day parade, there was also a serious wrong phenomenon, that is, many units were playing the failed scenes of Truman, Marshall, Acheson, MacArthur and their running dogs Chiang Kai-shek and American soldiers after being attacked by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The actors who dressed up as the US imperialists generally showed the reactionary leaders of the US imperialism as full of energy, showing off their power, just like the so-called "foreign masters" in the era of Chiang Kai-shek's rule in China. This kind of acting that destroys one's own ambition and enhances the prestige of the enemy does not conform to the current historical authenticity. The current reality is that due to the strength of the Chinese people, and fighting side by side with the Chinese and Korean people, our continuous victories on the Korean front have put the US imperialist aggression policy in a desperate situation, have made the reactionary leaders of the US imperialism tremble, and have deepened the internal divisions of the US ruling group. But our actors perform as if they are still so powerful in front of the Chinese people. The reason why our actors do this reveals that the profound influence left by the long-term aggression of US imperialism in China still exists in their blood. If this influence is not eliminated and allowed to exist in our Yangko program, it will have the opposite effect. We must pay close attention to this!

    In order to strengthen the ideological education of patriotism, our Yangko program should pay special attention to the correct performance of the Chinese people. We should portray the Chinese working people as healthy, simple, brave, hardworking, great and beautiful people in our entertainment programs, because as Chairman Mao said: "Our nation is no longer a nation that is insulted by others, we have stood up." Our arduous struggle has not only achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution, but also has great significance for safeguarding Asian and world peace due to the strength of our Chinese people. Therefore, we have a glorious position in the international community. However, in the past year, our mass entertainment has often had incorrect performances. For example, some schools play elderly workers and peasants, and they are generally performed as hunchbacked, coughing and spitting; performing old women always emphasizes her small feet, which makes people laugh. This is to replace the image of the working people with the image of the elderly of the idle class and the exploiting class. It is to look at the Chinese working people with the eyes of the imperialist "sick man of East Asia." In the past ten years or so, I have observed many elderly Chinese working people, from the old boatmen on the Yellow River to the old farmers in the countryside. Although they have experienced many years of hardship, the health of the vast majority of them is still much better than that of my intellectuals. When I see their image, I am reminded that our Chinese people will surely win. It is a great distortion to portray them as hunchbacked, coughing, and spitting. Moreover, even if Chinese old women are generally small-footed, we should not adopt a naturalistic approach, let alone emphasize this point and uglify it. Some schools perform the great unity dance of Chinese ethnic groups, and put large earrings and nose rings on the Tibetan people. I have seen many Tibetan people and have not seen them wear this kind of dress, but even if it is true, we should not emphasize the description. We have no reason to emphasize the backwardness of our brother ethnic groups due to historical reasons. I think we can only describe how they have made progress under the leadership of Chairman Mao. This is the correct way.

    In the New Year's Day entertainment programs, there was also a unit that played a program of ugly women and ugly men to make fun of the masses. This view of uglifying and ridiculing the Chinese working people has been left to us by the ruling class for many years, and we must correct it today.

    The above-mentioned undesirable phenomena existing in mass entertainment activities all violate the spirit of loving the motherland and loving the people. Today, if we want to strengthen the ideological education of patriotism, we must "eliminate the inferiority complex of the colonial people created and spread by imperialist aggression and its running dog comprador bourgeoisie and used to disintegrate the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle." Although the above points are mostly based on the situation in Taiyuan, they are also of reference significance to the whole province and even the whole country. I hereby put forward them for discussion with everyone, and hope that this year's Spring Festival mass entertainment movement will have better results.

　　提高春节文娱工作的政治性思想性
    ——从太原市元旦文娱活动中的一些错误现象谈起
    力群
    山西自全面解放以来，随着全省人民在政治上和经济上的翻身，在文化生活上也有了新的面貌。从一九五○年的开国后的第一个春节来看，全省群众文化活动有了显著的进步，并有了较为普遍深入的发展。从都市到农村，到处是一片欢乐的锣鼓声，人民在尽情的歌颂领袖毛主席，歌颂新中国，歌颂自身的解放，歌颂全国人民的大团结……。通过春节各种文娱活动，宣传了生产建设，巩固了胜利信心，教育了自己，娱乐了自己，闹得热火朝天，造成了全省的新气象，表现了新的人民的时代。
    一九五○年全省的春节文娱活动，从都市到农村，多半都是有领导的，负责机关事先有较好的布置，并发动了创作。就秧歌活动的内容来说：一般的都配合着当时的政治宣传任务，宣传了中苏友好、买公债等；过去的封建迷信与低级趣味的东西大为减少，而“牛代耕”、“种棉花”、“生产车”、“解放海南岛”、“打台湾”等新内容纷纷出现。此外，参加秧歌活动的村庄与人员的面积也是很宽的，而且妇女也相当普遍的参加了这一运动。很多地方都做到了自编自唱，并组织了竞赛。就形式方面来说，也是多种多样的，有秧歌、戏剧、高跷、抬阁、新旱船、国术、幻灯等。由于一九五○年春节的群众文娱活动在政治宣传上获得不小效果，在组织动员上获得了经验，并在内容与形式上都有不少的新创造，因而给一九五一年全省的春节群众宣传工作与文艺工作打下了良好的基础。
    我们的人民文艺是服务于政治任务的，“中国人民在一九五一年的中心任务，应当是用极大的努力，在军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上巩固我们的伟大祖国，使帝国主义者及其走狗没有可能来破坏我们的伟大革命事业和伟大建设事业。”（人民日报元旦社论）为此，在一九五一年的春节文娱运动中，深入开展抗美援朝运动，加强爱国主义、国际主义的思想教育，就应当成为中心的内容。
    如何通过春节文娱活动而继续发展抗美援朝运动与爱国主义、国际主义的思想教育，以“铲除帝国主义首先是美帝国主义在中国长期侵略所遗留的政治影响，并将这种思想斗争引导成为热爱祖国的高潮”呢？我想为了把这一工作进行的十分顺利，做出巨大的成绩，首先是各地有关领导机关，应事先对于参加春节文娱活动的骨干分子进行较深入的抗美援朝与爱国主义、国际主义的思想教育，帮助他们去进行集体创作，并很好的审查他们的节目。只有使参加春节文娱活动的骨干对时事有了正确的认识，在政治思想上有所提高，他们才有可能通过各种文娱形式，向广大人民群众进行宣传教育。他们学习的愈好，越有可能使他们的文娱节目有较高的思想性与教育意义。
    最近中央文化部和教育部发出指示说：“一九五一年的春节，是在全国人民爱国主义的热潮空前高涨的时候到来的，因此，春节宣传的内容应着重从各方面来反映中国人民的爱国主义高潮。”对于这个指示，我们必须很好的组织学习，使每一个参加春节文娱活动的人，都了解它，接受它。
    今年元旦，太原各文娱团体九十余个单位，曾举行了万余人的宣传游行。这次游行，曾有力的显示了我们太原的群众文化艺术队伍的力量，在文娱节目中也有不少创造，对太原市人民进行了抗美援朝与爱国主义的思想教育，影响是不小的。但在这次游行中，也看出了我们有很多参加文娱节目的骨干和演员对于时事和政治的学习是相当差的，在文娱节目的领导审查上也是很差的。例如有的单位，曾花了很大精力做了个很大的尿壶，尿壶口上出现了三个美帝反动派的头子，在那里乱动。大概作者的动机是要表示对于美帝的仇视、鄙视与蔑视吧，然而收获是不会大的。显然的，这种低级而庸俗的作品毫无严肃的内容，攻击敌人丝毫没有攻击到他的要害，因为尿壶与美帝的反动头子丝毫没有关联，既不能说明美帝的侵略本质与失败前途，又不能说明他的内外矛盾。因此对群众就毫无教育意义。我们必须明确的认识到：我们的文娱节目，不是为了好玩，不是为了逗人发笑，而是一种严肃的工作，是应有政治性和战斗性的，正如鲁迅先生在“辱骂和恐吓决不是战斗”一文中说：我们应“‘喜笑怒骂，皆成文章’，使敌人因此受伤或致死，而自己并无卑劣的行为，观者也不以为污秽，这才是战斗的作者的本领。”在我们的游行行列里，除了以上情况，还有人抬着一个大乌龟，上边写着“阎锡山”，这种作法，等于骂了他一声爹娘，但丝毫不能揭露作为汉奸与残酷屠杀山西人民的阎锡山的反动本质。这种作法也是鲁迅先生反对过的。
    其次，在我们的游行行列里还有这样一种现象，就是敌我的界限划的不清，把美帝和他的走狗都参加了我们的秧歌队伍，这是不妥当的。因为集体的秧歌舞是表示中国人民的大团结，而在我们中国人民的大家庭里，是不能允许敌人存在的。周扬同志在一九四四年看了延安春节秧歌以后发表的“表现新的群众的时代”一文中就曾说过：“有同志主张大秧歌舞中应该是工农兵和人民大众的形象，不应掺入小丑和反派角色，节目中的反派角色，或者不参加大舞，或者到演出时再化装。这个主张，我觉得是对的。大秧歌应当是人民的集体舞，人民的大合唱。”
    在元旦游行中，还有一个严重的错误现象，就是很多单位都在扮演杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊、麦克阿瑟及其走狗蒋介石与美国兵在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打击后的失败场面中，那些装扮美帝国主义者的演员，普遍的都把美帝的反动头子表现得神气十足，耀武扬威，犹如当年在蒋介石统治中国时代的所谓“洋大人”的姿态。这种灭自己的志气，长敌人的威风的演法是不合目前的历史真实性的。目前的现实是：由于中国人民力量的强大，与中朝人民并肩作战，我们在朝鲜前线的不断胜利已使美帝的侵略政策陷于绝境，已使美帝的反动头子为之发抖，已使美国统治集团内部分裂加深。而我们的演员却演得他们在中国人民面前还是那样强大。我们的这些演员这样做，正透露了在他们的血液里还存在着美帝国主义在中国长期侵略所遗留下的深刻的影响。这种影响不肃清而让它还存在于我们的秧歌节目中，是会产生反面的效果的。这一点，我们必须十分的注意！
    为了加强爱国主义的思想教育，我们的秧歌节目应特别重视正确的表演中国人民，我们应该在我们的文娱节目中把中国的劳动人民表演成健康、朴实、勇敢、勤劳的伟大而美好的人民，因为正如毛主席所说：“我们的民族再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了。”我们的艰苦奋斗，不但取得了中国革命的胜利，而且由于我们中国人民力量的强大，对保卫亚洲和世界和平都有重大的意义。因而我们在国际上有了光荣的地位。但近一年来，我们的群众文娱时常有不正确的表演，例如某些学校扮演年老的工农，总是普遍的表演成弓腰曲背，咳嗽吐痰；表演老太婆也总是强调她小足的步法，引人发笑。这是以有闲阶级和剥削阶级的老年人的形象来代替劳动人民的形象的，这是用帝国主义者的“东亚病夫”的眼光来看中国的劳动人民的。近十余年来，我观察了不少年老的中国劳动人民，从黄河的老船夫直到乡村的老农民，他们虽然经历了多年的风霜艰苦，然而他们绝大多数的身体仍然比我这知识分子健康的多。我看到他们的形象就联想到我们中国人民一定能胜利，如果把他们描绘成弓腰曲背，咳嗽吐痰，真是很大的歪曲。而且即使中国老太婆普遍是小足，我们也不应采用自然主义的手法，更不应强调这点而加以丑化。有的学校表演中国各民族大团结舞，把藏族人民给带上大耳环与大鼻环，我曾见过不少藏族人民，没有看见过他们有这种装扮，但即使真有，我们也不应去强调描写，我们没有理由去强调我们兄弟民族由于历史的原因所造成的落后现象。我想，我们只能描写他们在毛主席的领导下如何进步起来，这才是正确的办法。
    在新年元旦的文娱节目中，也曾有一个单位扮演了丑婆和丑汉的节目以取笑于群众，这种丑化与奚落中国劳动人民的观点是多少年来统治阶级遗留给我们的，今天我们对此是必须加以纠正了。
    以上所举的这些存在于群众文娱活动中的不良现象，都是违反着爱祖国爱人民的精神的。今天我们要加强爱国主义的思想教育，就正是要“消灭帝国主义侵略及其走狗买办资产阶级所制造、散布、并借以瓦解中国人民革命斗争的殖民地人民的自卑心”。虽然以上所指，多半根据太原一地的情况，但对全省以至全国亦有参考意义，特提出与大家商讨，并愿今年春节的群众文娱运动有更好的成绩。
