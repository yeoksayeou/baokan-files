　　National Religious Circles Continue to Launch Patriotic Movement
　　　　　　Beijing
Amidst the cheers of victory in the resistance against America for the aid of Korea by the Chinese and Korean people, church people in Beijing spent their 1950 Christmas season with joy. A huge couplet was posted at the entrance of the Church of the Chinese Holy Communion, which read: "Celebrate Christmas, do not forget the Reform Movement," and "Celebrate the festival and strive for self-sufficiency and self-propagation." A large red paper banner hung on the wall in the courtyard, which read: "Celebrate Christmas, Resist America and Aid Korea, Defend the Home and Defend the Country." The church held a grand service on the morning of the 24th, and Pastor Lei Haifeng preached, citing the story in the Bible that today's American imperialists are the hypocritical Pharisees whom Jesus hated deeply. They "wear sheep's clothing on the outside, but are ferocious wolves on the inside." We should tear off their hypocritical masks and expose their true colors, otherwise, they will harm countless good people. At the "Christmas Celebration Evening Party" of the Beijing Christian Women's Association, a white-bearded "Santa Claus" slowly walked in and said to the children that he had just rushed from Warsaw and Korea. In Warsaw, representatives of the people of eighty countries around the world recently held a conference and decided to stop the American imperialists from expanding the war of aggression and defend world peace; in Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are winning great victories, not allowing American robbers to bully their fathers, mothers, and children. At the same time, the Chinese Holy Communion Church in Xicheng performed a drama about the birth of Jesus Christ, and the parishioners made patriotic donations on the spot.

Graint was the acting president, he colluded with the 'Relief Administration' and obtained 30,000 to 40,000 US dollars in the name of donating and building wards, hoarding gold and cotton, and speculating on a large scale, but the donated wards are still empty shells today."

　　全国宗教界继续展开爱国运动
            北京
    北京市在中朝两国人民抗美胜利声中，北京市教会人士以欣快的心情，度过了他们一九五○年度的耶稣诞生节。中华圣公会礼拜堂门口张贴着巨幅对联，上书：“庆祝圣诞勿忘革新运动”、“欢庆佳节努力自养自传”；院子里的墙上挂着一大张红纸制成的标语：写着“庆祝圣诞，抗美援朝，保家卫国”。该堂于二十四日早上举行大礼拜，由雷海风牧师讲道，他引述圣经上的故事说，今日的美帝国主义者就是耶稣深恶痛绝的假冒为善的法利赛人，它“外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼”。应该揭去它假冒为善的面具，让它露出原形，不然，它将要残害无数善良的人。在北京市基督教女青年会“庆祝圣诞晚会”上，白胡须的“圣诞老人”徐徐走进来，向孩子们说，他刚从华沙和朝鲜赶来。在华沙，全世界八十个国家人民的代表，最近开过一个大会，决定制止美帝国主义扩大侵略战争，保卫世界和平；在朝鲜，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军正打大胜仗，不让美国强盗来欺侮爸爸妈妈和孩子们。与此同时，西城中华圣公会演出了耶稣基督降生的戏剧，教徒们并当场进行爱国主义的捐献。
