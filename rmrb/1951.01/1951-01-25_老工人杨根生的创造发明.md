    Inventions of Veteran Worker Yang Gensheng
    To the Editor:
    I am a pottery technician in Dingshan Pottery District, Yixing, Jiangsu. We have an old worker here named Yang Gensheng, who specializes in researching chemical and glaze applications in pottery. In previous years, he had already invented chemical agents for the acid resistance of acid storage jars. The royal blue color used on the tiles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum in Nanjing in 1926 was his invention. He is now forty-six years old, and over the past twenty years, he has invented a total of nine colors of glaze (dark blue, light blue, dark green, maroon, black, porcelain white, ordinary white, transparent, and goose yellow). In particular, he has recently created the sand core used in water filter towers. Previously, our country had to purchase these from American, British, and Japanese imperialists at high prices, but now we can create them ourselves. I hope the People's Government can pay attention to such talent and take effective measures to develop and utilize all the creative power of the working class, and take practical actions to defeat the American imperialist blockade and strengthen the power to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country.

    老工人杨根生的创造发明编辑同志：
    我是江苏宜兴鼎山陶工区的陶器技术人员，我们这里有一位老工友叫杨根生，他专门研究化学及陶器上应用之药釉。在前几年已发明过储酸坛耐酸性的化学药品。一九二六年南京中山陵瓦上用的宝蓝颜色就是他发明的。他今年四十六岁了，二十余年来他一共发明了九种颜色的药釉（深蓝、淡蓝、墨绿、栗色、黑色、瓷白、普通白、透明、鹅黄）特别是在最近创造了滤水塔中用之砂心。这在以前我国都是用高价向美英日本帝国主义者购买，但现在却能自己创造了。我希望人民政府能注意这样的人材，并采取有效的办法，发挥并运用工人阶级的所有的创造力量，以实际行动战胜美帝封锁，加强抗美援朝保家卫国的力量。
