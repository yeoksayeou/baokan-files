Introducing the Winter School in Nan'anhe Village, Suburbs of Beijing
    Li Yifan
    Nan'anhe Village is a mountain village located at the junction of the 13th District of the western suburbs of Beijing and Wanping County. The village has 283 households with a population of over 1,200, including five Communist Party members and four members of the Communist Youth League. The winter school was established in the winter of 1949. This year's winter school has 82 students, all men (women's classes have not started due to housing issues). They are divided into two classes, A and B. Class A studies the fourth volume of the Peasants' Textbook, and Class B studies the second volume. Since the beginning of this year's winter school, thanks to the village cadres' emphasis on winter education, unified leadership, and close integration of teaching content with central tasks, it has not only improved the farmers' cultural level but has also greatly helped production work. The situation of the winter school in this village is introduced as follows:
    1. Cadres are proactive and enthusiastic: For example, Zhang Guodong, the village's cultural and educational committee member, has been busy with winter school ever since returning from training in the district. He also serves as the winter school's political instructor. Every night, in addition to teaching, he studies winter school work until very late before going to sleep. The village chief himself also participates in the learning. They have a high reputation among the masses and have played a significant role in mobilizing and encouraging students to learn.
    2. Teachers are hardworking and teach well: The good results of Nan'anhe Winter School are inseparable from the efforts of the teachers. Elementary school teacher Zhou Chonghua teaches more than 90 elementary school students alone during the day and teaches arithmetic at the winter school at night. Farmers in this village need arithmetic very much because they participate in sideline production. Zhou Chonghua's teaching methods are able to relate to reality, such as explaining how much firewood can be exchanged for corn and cabbage, how to calculate the wages for quarrying stones, and how to spend money, etc., so everyone especially likes his arithmetic class. Now, Class A has learned the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers and decimals (they only knew integer addition in the past), and Class B started with single-digit addition and has now learned multiplication with a three-digit multiplier and a one-digit multiplicand. Zhang Guodong's political lessons are also able to relate to reality, especially able to closely link the central tasks of each period with political lessons. Everyone says, "It can really solve ideological problems."
    3. The system is established by everyone and abided by everyone: The winter school in this village holds classes six times a week, two hours each time (from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM). Later, because those who went out to quarry stones were too tired to run back every day to attend winter school, it was stipulated that those who quarry stones would rest for two days a week and study for four days, starting half an hour later; those who cut firewood would still study six times a week. Systems for roll call, leave application, and examinations were also established. Because the system was established at everyone's request, everyone adheres to it very well.
    4. Combining with central work and unified leadership: All central work in the village is first arranged and studied in the winter school. For example, in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, donating comfort items, the anti-Yiguandao movement, and the supplementary levy of local surtaxes, students have played a leading and promoting role in completing tasks after studying in the winter school. For example, when the comfort donation conference was held, most of those who responded on the spot were winter school students. In the crackdown on the Yiguandao movement, winter school students became propagandists. Everyone carried out propaganda anytime and anywhere during the day while working, shouting the Yiguandao's deceptive "five-word mantra" everywhere, completely exposing the Yiguandao's deceptive activities.
    5. Learning promotes production, achieving both production and learning: The winter school responded to the government's call for winter production, and teacher Zhang Guodong and the village chief personally organized the masses to contract for quarrying stones, and winter school students enthusiastically participated. A temporary trade union was organized with more than 50 members, and winter school students accounted for 30 of them. At the same time, whether students were cutting firewood in the mountains or quarrying stones, they carried chalk with them and practiced writing and solving problems at any time.
    It can be seen from the above that Nan'anhe Winter School has achieved good results, but there are still several issues that need to be studied and improved.
    1. Whether it is too much for those who cut firewood in the mountains to study six times a week is worth studying. At present, the students' learning enthusiasm is very high, but in order to consolidate and sustain it, it is necessary to appropriately take care of the difficulties of individual or some students and moderately reduce the number of learning sessions.
    2. More than 30 women have requested to study, but a women's class has not yet been established. There may be many difficulties, but efforts should be made to solve them to meet their requirements. It is hoped that the district government can also provide assistance.
    3. Consolidate the general learning enthusiasm, especially through several of the most active learners, plan to establish a year-round people's school. It is commendable that elementary school teachers are enthusiastic about teaching at the winter school, but for the long-term, elementary school teachers are very busy, and relying too much on elementary school teachers is also difficult. Therefore, in establishing a people's school, attention should be paid to mobilizing people in the village with considerable cultural levels to teach voluntarily.

　　介绍京郊南安河村的冬学
    李一帆
    南安河村是北京西郊十三区与宛平县交界的山村。全村有二百八十三户，一千二百多人，其中有五个共产党员，四个青年团员。冬学是一九四九年冬天开始办的。今年冬学有学员八十二人，都是男人（妇女因房子没解决，没开班），共分甲乙两班，甲班学习农民课本第四册，乙班学习第二册。今年冬学从开学到现在，由于村干部重视冬学，统一领导，并使教学内容和中心工作紧密结合，不但在提高农民文化上收到了效果，对生产工作也有很大帮助。现将该村冬学情况介绍如下：
    一、干部积极热心：如村文教委员章国栋，从区里受训回来，便整天为冬学奔忙。他自己兼任冬学政治教员。每天晚上除教课外，就研究冬学工作，一直到很晚才睡。村长自己也参加了学习。他们在群众中威信很高，在动员与鼓励学员学习上，起了很大作用。
    二、教员努力，教的好：南安河冬学成绩好，与教员的努力是分不开的。小学教员周崇华，白天一人教九十多个小学生，晚上担任冬学的算术。这村农民因参加副业生产，对算术很需要。而周崇华在教法上能联系实际，如讲多少柴换多少玉米、白菜，打石子工资如何计算，如何花用等，因之大家特别喜欢上他的算术课。现在甲班算术整数小数的加减乘除都学会了（过去只会整数加法），乙班从一位加法学起，现已学会了被乘数三位、乘数一位的乘法。章国栋教政治课也能联系实际，特别能把每一时期的中心工作与政治课密切联系起来，大家都说：“真能解决思想问题。”
    三、制度由大家建立，大家遵守：这村冬学是每周上课六次，每次两小时（下午六点至八点）。后来因出去打石子的，每天跑回上冬学太累，规定打石子的每周休息两天，学习四天，并且晚开始半点钟；割柴的每周仍学习六次。还建立了点名、请假、考试等制度。因为制度是大家要求建立的，所以大家坚持得很好。
    四、结合中心工作，统一领导：村中的一切中心工作，都先在冬学里布置学习。如抗美援朝，募捐慰劳品，反一贯道，补征地方附加粮等，学员们经过在冬学中学习，在完成任务上都起了带头与推动作用。如开募捐慰劳品大会时，当场响应的大部是冬学学员。取缔一贯道运动中，冬学学员都成了宣传员。大家在白天做活时随时随地进行宣传，将一贯道骗人的“五字真言”到处喊说，把一贯道骗人的勾当完全暴露出来。
    五、学习推动了生产，作到了生产学习两不误：冬学响应了政府冬季生产的号召，教员章国栋和村长亲自组织群众包工打石子，冬学学员踊跃参加。组织了临时工会。会员五十多名，冬学学员就占三十名。同时学员们不论是上山割柴或打石子时，都带着粉笔，随时练习写字、演题。
    从上面可以看出南安河冬学的成绩，但还有几个问题，是须要研究改进的。
    一、上山割柴的，每周学习六次，是否太多，值得研究。目前学员学习情绪很高，但为了巩固与持久，适当照顾个别或一部学员的困难，酌量减少学习次数，是必要的。
    二、妇女要求学习的已有三十多人，但今天还没有办起妇女班。困难可能是不少，但应设法解决，以满足她们的要求。希望区政府也能给予协助。
    三、巩固一般学习情绪，特别应通过几个学习最积极的分子，计划建立常年民校。小学教员热心教冬学是值得表扬的，但为长期打算，小学教员工作很忙，太多依靠小学教员，也是有困难的。因之，建立民校，应注意在村中动员有相当文化程度的人义务教学。
