[Report from this newspaper] Since the start of the Huai River middle reaches control project in mid-November of last year, by the end of December, the number of workers on the dikes has reached 600,000. Work has commenced on 23 sections totaling 44.5 million cubic meters of earthwork in the first year (out of a total task of 29 sections and 52.8 million cubic meters), with a daily progress of approximately 1.2 million cubic meters of earth. The construction of each section has been completed ahead of schedule, or is about to be completed ahead of schedule. For example, the Anqing Special District's winter repair project of the river dike, after the efforts of 110,000 cadres and masses, started on December 10th of last year and was basically completed in just over 20 days. The 59,000 cubic meter ring dike project in the Lao Ying section of Huainan City was completed ahead of schedule on December 25th, with both projects meeting standards. The Xiaoji Township worker team in Jiangkou District also completed its 16,000 cubic meter dike repair task ahead of schedule in twelve and a half days. On the 26th, the entire team, carrying the two red flags issued by the higher authorities, returned home amidst the cheers of the masses. Furthermore, for the eighty-plus li ring dike project in Wuhe County, the original plan was to strive to complete the Chaoyangba and other dike sections by the end of the lunar year. However, with the efforts of tens of thousands of workers, some sections have already been completed, and the entire project is expected to be completed within days. After the full-scale commencement of work by 340,000 workers along the Huai and Sui Rivers in the Sixian Special District, 3 million cubic meters of earthwork were completed within a week. The Bengbu ring dike has completed 290,000 cubic meters, accounting for 46 percent of the total earthwork. The Ying Shang winter repair task has also been largely completed. The Zhengyangguan section dredging project has now excavated more than 190,000 cubic meters of earth, completing two-fifths of the entire project.

There are many difficulties in the project. In the Sui River Lingbi section dredging project, it is necessary to open up a new river channel, of which 50 *hua li* needs to be drained. In the freezing weather, the workers used *badou* and other tools to remove water and extract soil from under the ice. In Tianhekou, Fengyang, there are 500 meters of sandy soil. Initially, it was discovered that there was a foot of silt on top. Under the leadership of a team in a work brigade, the silt was scooped up, which motivated the entire team to pass the mud. The soil quality of the Shiyang Dam in Huaiyuan was too tight to conveniently use rammers, so the workers came up with a solution of mixing in dry soil, loosening the soil, and scraping loose mud. Every day, the workers on the Fuyang and Bengbu ring dikes had to shovel off a layer of frozen soil that was an inch thick before extracting soil and ramming the dikes. Only these workers, coming from disaster areas and personally suffering from the scourge of floods, and educated by the People's Government, could display such a high degree of labor enthusiasm, overcome numerous difficulties, and complete the task ahead of schedule.

　　淮河中游六十万民工上堤
    发挥高度劳动热情提前完成任务
    【本报讯】淮河中游治理工程自去年十一月中旬开工以来，至十二月底止，上堤民工已达六十万，先后在第一年度二十三段四千四百五十万公方的工段上（总任务二十九段五千二百八十万公方）动工，每天进程约一百二十万公方土左右。各段工程纷纷提前完成，或即将提前完成任务。如安庆专区江堤冬修工程，经干部群众共十一万人的努力，于去年十二月十日上堤开工以后二十余日，即已基本完成了任务；淮南市老应段五万九千公方圈堤工程则在十二月二十五日已提前完成，两处所作工程均合乎标准；江口区小集乡民工中队于十二天半时间也提前完成了一万六千方土修堤任务，全队于二十六日扛着上级发给的两面红旗，在群众吹吹打打欢送声里回了家。又如五河县八十余里圈堤工程，原计划争取在旧历年底完成朝阳坝等段堤工，但在数万民工奋力修筑下，部分已告完成，全部工程日内可望结束；宿县专区淮濉两河三十四万民工全线开工后，一周内即已完成三百万公方土的工程；蚌埠圈堤完成了二十九万公方，占总土方的百分之四十六；颍上冬修任务也已大部完成；正阳关段疏浚工程现已挖土十九万多方，完成了整段工程的五分之二。
    工程中的困难是很多的。濉河灵璧段疏浚工程中需开辟新河道，其中五十华里需排水，天寒地冻，民工们用了笆斗等工具在冰块下面出水取土；凤阳天河口有五百公尺砂疆土，开始发现上边有一尺深淤泥，在一中队一组民工带头下，把淤泥捞起，推动全队民工传泥；怀远石羊坝土质太泾不便行硪，民工想出办法用掺干土、挖松土、刮松泥的办法解决；阜阳与蚌埠圈堤民工每日都要把泥土上一层有一寸厚的冻土铲掉，然后取土上堤行硪。只有这些来自灾区、亲身饱受水灾祸害，在人民政府教育下的民工，才能发挥出这样的高度劳动热情，克服了重重困难并提前完成任务。
