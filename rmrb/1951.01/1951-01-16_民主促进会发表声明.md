Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The China Association for Promoting Democracy has issued a statement protesting the Yoshida government of Japan's illegal sentencing of patriotic Japanese workers to heavy penalties under the pretext of the "Matsukawa Incident." It also protests the illegal searches and plunder by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries of the Tokyo Japan-China Friendship Association and the General Association of Chinese Students in Japan, as well as the illegal arrest of staff members of the Japan-China Friendship Association and other atrocities. The statement said: This series of reactionary atrocities fully proves that after the disastrous failure of U.S. imperialism in the war of aggression against Korea, it is stepping up the suppression of the increasingly high tide of the patriotic and democratic movement of the Japanese people in order to smoothly restore Japanese fascist armed forces, transform Japan into a U.S. military base, and prepare for expanding the war of aggression. We solemnly declare: (1) The search and looting of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the General Association of Chinese Students in Japan by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries is a barbaric provocation against the Chinese people. The attempt of U.S. imperialism to restore and strengthen fascist rule in Japan and conspire to arm Japan completely violates the Potsdam Declaration, and the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world cannot sit idly by. (2) The U.S. military tribunal and the Yoshida government of Japan should immediately revoke the illegal sentences and stop the trials of those arrested in the "Matsukawa Incident" and the Japan-China Friendship Association, and unconditionally release all patriotic Japanese people who have been arrested for fighting for democratic liberation.
