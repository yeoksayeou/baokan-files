　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 7th: The Pravda diplomatic commentator, Viktorov, wrote in a commentary on the opening of the new US Congress: American newspapers unanimously predict that the Congress will sharply criticize Acheson's current foreign policy direction. The turmoil stirred up by former US President Hoover's speech attacking the Truman-Acheson foreign policy has not subsided but intensified. Viktorov pointed out that in this regard, American newspapers are talking a great deal about the growth of isolationist tendencies in the United States, wrongly attributing the tendency towards isolationism to Hoover himself. However, the plans put forward by Hoover and elaborated by Taft in his Senate speech on January 5 show that neither of them is an isolationist. The Hoover-Taft plan is an aggressive imperialist plan that attempts to dominate the world. The reason why Hoover's and Taft's speeches have aroused such a wide response at home is that they both recognize that the American adventure in Korea has failed, and that the current government's policies are in danger of causing disaster, which has aroused increasing dissatisfaction among the broadest masses of the people.
    Viktorov continued: Truman and Acheson's political enemies, both Republican and Democrat, want to take advantage of the government's increasing isolation and weakened position at home to pursue their own selfish goals. However, the Truman government's position has not only been undermined at home, but this has caused no small panic among the American ruling circles. The often well-informed American reactionary commentator Lippmann said that events in the past six months have raised the question of whether the United States is becoming more and more isolated. Pointing out the growing deterioration of relations between the United States and other members of the Anglo-American bloc, Lippmann wrote: European and Asian countries do not trust our leadership. ... All this leads to the same result - the disintegration of our alliance and the isolation of North America.
    Viktorov pointed out that it is clear from Lippmann's argument that the problem is not isolationism but the increasing isolation of the United States. It is precisely this that has alarmed those American ruling circles in the newly elected Congress who oppose the Truman-Acheson government.
    Viktorov concluded: The struggle that has developed in the American ruling circles, and the sharpness of this struggle, confirm the full depth of the crisis in American foreign policy, and the failure of the infamous "overall diplomacy."

    论美国外交政策失败
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：真理报外交评论家维克托罗夫在评论美国新国会的开幕时写道：美国报纸一致预料国会将对艾奇逊的外交政策的现行方针作尖锐批评。抨击杜鲁门——艾奇逊外交政策的美国前总统胡佛的演说所激起的纷乱，非但没有平静下去，反而更加剧烈起来了。维克托罗夫指出：在这方面，美国报纸大事谈论美国的孤立主义倾向的增长，把朝向孤立主义的倾向错误地归之于胡佛本人。但是由胡佛提出并由塔夫脱在一月五日参院演说中加以阐明的计划表明：这两个人并没有一个是孤立主义者。胡佛——塔夫脱的计划是妄图统治世界的侵略性帝国主义的计划。胡佛的和塔夫脱的演说所以在国内引起如此广泛的反响，是因为他们都承认美国在朝鲜的冒险已经失败，都承认：目前政府方针有招致灾祸的危险，这种方针已引起最广大的人民愈来愈甚的不满。
    维克托罗夫继续说：在共和党中以及在民主党中的杜鲁门与艾奇逊的政敌，想利用政府日益孤立以及它在国内地位削弱的处境来遂其私图。但是，杜鲁门政府的地位还不仅在国内被破坏了，这在美国统治集团中已引起不小的惊慌。经常消息灵通的美国反动政论家李普曼说：过去六个月内的事情已经引起美国是否正在愈来愈孤立的问题。李普曼在指出美国与美英集团中其他成员间的关系日益恶化时写道：欧洲的与亚洲的国家都不信赖我们的领导。……所有这一切引导到同一的结果——我们联盟的破裂和北美的孤立。
    维克托罗夫指出：从李普曼的论点中可明显地看出：问题并不是孤立主义而是美国的日益孤立。正好就是这件事情，使得在新近选出的国会中反对杜鲁门——艾奇逊政府的那些美国统治集团惊慌起来的。
    维克托罗夫在结语中写道：已经在美国统治集团中发展起来的斗争以及这个斗争的尖锐的程度，证实了美国外交政策危机的全部深度，证实了恶名昭彰的“总体外交”的失败。
