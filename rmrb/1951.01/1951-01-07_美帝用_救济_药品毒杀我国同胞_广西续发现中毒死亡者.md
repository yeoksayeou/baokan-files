Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 3rd. More cases of our compatriots dying from poisoning after taking American "relief" drug sodium sulfate have been discovered in Yongfu and other places in Guangxi. According to an article by Professor Jin Weifan of Guangxi Provincial Medical College in Guilin: In addition to the railway workers who died in Liuzhou, Huangmian and other places, on November 18, 1950, Guo Wei, a teacher at Yongfu County Middle School, went to a private clinic in the county for treatment. He died eight hours after taking American-made sodium sulfate. The results of the Guilin Guangxi Provincial Hospital's test proved that the sodium sulfate he took was sodium silicofluoride, which is used to kill insects. In addition, there were also deaths due to poisoning from taking this drug before liberation, including Liao Ronggui, a 13-year-old girl living in Guilin (June 1948), and Wang Weiru, a clerk in the pseudo-Laibin County Government (December 1947). Similar situations also occurred in Binyang, Liucheng and other counties in November 1947 and January 1948. Professor Jin Weifan made a solemn accusation in the Guibei Daily regarding this matter, saying: "This is another ironclad proof of U.S. imperialism poisoning the Chinese people. We must demand repayment for this blood debt!" In response, the Health Department of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government has notified medical institutions and private hospitals and clinics in its subordinate counties and cities to strictly implement the regulations of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and stop using American "relief" drug sodium sulfate.
