　　The Aggressive Activities of American Missionaries in China Before 1858
    Yu Shengwu
    In the past century, the so-called missionary work actively promoted by the American church in China has been inextricably linked with the aggression of the American bourgeois government against China from the very beginning. From the outset, American missionaries colluded with their government, willingly acting as vanguards for the invasion of China, using fraudulent means and political pressure to seize by trickery and coercion, leaving behind ugly deeds in our history that can never be washed away. The first American Christian missionary to come to China, Rev. E.C. Bridgman, once said that their coming from afar was "not so much for religious reasons as for political reasons." We must clearly recognize the true faces of these black-shirted thugs who wear robes and use religion as a guise.
    Bridgman arrived in Guangzhou in February 1830. He and D. Abeel were the first American missionaries to come to China. In 1832, he independently founded a periodical called "Chinese Repository," serving as its editor and main contributor, specializing in "introducing" various aspects of China at that time to foreigners, especially Americans, focusing on advocating aggressive ideas and providing specific strategies for invading China in the capacity of an expert on China. Not only did foreign merchants benefit greatly from this publication, but even the American government, which had a vague understanding of China at the time, was deeply influenced by the "Chinese Repository." We must not forget that many clauses in the Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia were drafted based on the opinions provided by the "Chinese Repository." (Note 1)
    In 1834, Rev. Peter Parker, an outstanding American missionary, came to Guangzhou. He soon opened an eye hospital there, and business flourished day by day. Therefore, Parker took the opportunity to make extensive contacts with people from all walks of life in China and boldly carried out his work of buying people's hearts. All of Parker's actions in China stemmed from the motive of "opening up China" and trying to allow the infiltration of American economic and political forces into China. Before the Opium War, he had "earnestly" suggested to Lin Zexu that the only way to completely resolve Sino-Western disputes was to conclude a treaty with Western countries. That is to say, it would be better to automatically satisfy their demands in a peaceful manner. After the war broke out, Parker, seeing that Britain had already taken action, quickly ran back to the United States to appeal to President Van Buren and Secretary of State Forsyth, saying that they should "directly and without hesitation dispatch a plenipotentiary minister to the Qing court," but at that time, the United States was busy with presidential elections, and everyone did not have much energy to pay attention to this matter. After the new government was established, Parker repeatedly mentioned it to the new Secretary of State Daniel Webster. Soon, news of the Treaty of Nanjing came, and the American government believed that the time had come, and decided to send an envoy to China to negotiate a treaty according to Parker's method, trying to obtain the same benefits as Britain. (Note 2)
    On February 24, 1844, Caleb Cushing led the American treaty-making delegation to Macau. Parker, Bridgman, and another American missionary, S. Wells Williams, all gladly took up the positions of secretary and translator for Cushing. (Note 3) With the assistance of the three of them, China was forced to conclude the Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia, which was even more harsh than the Treaty of Nanjing. As mentioned earlier, several clauses of the treaty were drafted based on the opinions provided by the "Chinese Repository" edited by Bridgman. From this fact alone, it can be inferred how important a role American missionaries played in the Treaty of Wangxia.
    During the Opium War, many American missionaries took advantage of the fire and followed closely behind the British army, using the armed forces of the invaders to expand the power of the church; Gulangyu, Hong Kong, Zhoushan, Ningbo and other places had the footprints of American missionaries before the war was over. (Note 4) The way the American church adopted to preach in China was such a shameful way of cooperating with the armed forces of the invaders!
    After the signing of the two treaties of Nanjing and Wangxia, missionaries not only obtained the "legal right" to preach in the five ports, but also obtained the so-called extraterritoriality that seriously harmed China's sovereignty. Their excitement at this time is completely imaginable. Shuck, an American Baptist missionary, described his inner joy at the time. In a letter to his church, he wrote: "I am now able to report to you a glorious news, Great Britain has signed a peace treaty with China, and this pagan country has finally been attacked and opened." Parker also could not help but announce that "a brand-new era has now arrived." (Note 5) The Chinese people suffered from the invaders and were forced to conclude treaties that humiliated the country and forfeited its sovereignty, while American missionaries profited from it and cheered for China's disaster. Isn't the face of hypocrites exposed clearly?
    After the conclusion of the Treaty of Wangxia, Parker was meritorious in invading China and was honorably appointed as the secretary of the American embassy in China the following year. At the same time, his wife was a relative of Webster. Relying on this family connection, he was able to gradually emerge in the diplomatic world, and finally officially took office as the envoy to China in September 1855. After shouldering the overall responsibility for invading China, his first task was to find a way to revise the Treaty of Wangxia and expand the vested interests of the United States in China. In order to achieve this goal, he personally went to Europe to express to the British and French authorities the sincerity of the United States in fully cooperating with them in China. But what greatly disappointed Parker was that after he returned to China from Europe, he repeatedly hit several not-so-small snags. First of all, Ye Mingchen not only did not discuss treaty revision with him, but even refused to meet him. Then Parker went to Fujian, but unexpectedly, the Fujian officials also returned the letter from the American President to Xianfeng. From then on, Parker tore off his mask and revealed the true face of a robber. On December 12, 1856, he made a vicious suggestion to Secretary of State Marcy, advocating that the United States occupy Taiwan, France occupy Korea, and Britain re-occupy Zhoushan, and "return" them to China after the treaty revision issue was satisfactorily resolved. Marcy replied that the American naval power did not allow this to be done at the moment, and it was best to be patient and not seriously hinder the "friendly relations" between China and the United States.
    The facts tell us that Parker was willing to destroy even this hypocritical "friendly relationship." At that time, President Pierce's term was about to expire, and Parker heard that he would soon be dismissed, so he was even more anxious to make a "heroic career" before leaving office. On February 12, 1857, he suggested to the State Council:
    "Taiwan has become a very interesting topic for many of our businessmen at the moment, and it should receive more attention from this great Western commercial country than it has in the past; it is hoped that the United States government will not shrink from this action regarding Taiwan, which concerns the interests of humanity, civilization, navigation, and commerce..."
    Clearly, it was just a conspiracy to occupy Chinese territory for the benefit of the American bourgeoisie, but he also said that it was to safeguard "humanity" and promote "civilization." Can there be more shameless rhetoric in the world than this? The Bible teaches people to be honest, but now Rev. Parker is spreading such a big lie. Isn't this blasphemy of Christian doctrine?
    In a public letter marked "secret" on March 10, Parker once again blatantly expressed his ambition. He wrote:
    "Once shipping lanes are opened between California, Japan, and China, this coal supply base (referring to Taiwan) will be very useful; it is obvious that these islands will not belong to this empire for long. If it is politically separated from this empire as it is geographically, the United States should obviously occupy it, especially because of the great principle of the balance of power."
    Parker was only happy to say it at this time, only pursuing the "balance of power," and had long forgotten his original proposal to return Taiwan to China after the treaty revision issue was resolved! He even decided to send officers to Taiwan before obtaining the consent of his home government, and raise the Stars and Stripes there first, saying that doing so "may have a significant relationship to the future"!
    On the other hand, the American government was far less enthusiastic about this issue than Parker. Pierce and Marcy both considered that the American naval power in the Far East was too weak, and occupying Taiwan was not easy to do at the moment. Therefore, no matter how eloquently Parker spoke, and how wonderfully he described it, he was poured a bucket of cold water in the end. And soon J. Buchanan was elected president, and William Reed took office as the minister to China, and Rev. Parker finally left in disappointment. (Note 6)
    In 1858, the United States took advantage of the opportunity of the Anglo-French Allied Forces invading China to force the Manchu Qing government to sign the Sino-American Treaty of Tianjin, obtaining special rights such as "traveling" inland, increasing the number of open ports, revising tariffs, and freely "preaching." In the process of signing this treaty, American missionaries played an indispensable role, just as they did when signing the Treaty of Wangxia. The most important secretaries of the American minister William Reed at that time were William and Rev. W.A.P. Martin. In the Sino-American Treaty of Tianjin, almost every clause was drafted with reference to the opinions of these two American missionaries, especially Article 29, which was entirely a masterpiece of the two from drafting to signing. This religious clause stipulates that "...hereafter all persons who teach or profess peacefully the doctrines of Christianity shall alike be entitled to the protection of the authorities of the state; nor shall any such, peaceably pursuing their calling and obeying the laws, be molested or persecuted." The Manchu Qing government, learning from experience, was wary of missionaries, so at first it always refused to agree, and William Reed was not enthusiastic about this clause either. In the end, it was entirely due to the insistence of William and W.A.P. Martin, who coerced and enticed the Manchu Qing plenipotentiary ministers, who could not withstand their intimidation and were finally forced to accept. (Note 7)
    Such a clause, first of all, of course, completely changed the status of American missionaries in China. From then on, they had the treaty as a talisman, and the gunboats of their own country as a backing, and they could swagger to any place in China to preach, and do all kinds of good deeds that the Chinese people had tasted enough of! American missionaries only cared about expanding their preaching path, and did not hesitate to use political pressure to ruin China's sovereignty. Since it was clearly stipulated that "all those who teach or profess peacefully the doctrines of Christianity, whether they be citizens of the United States or Chinese Christians, shall not be disturbed by others," it was equivalent to classifying Chinese Christians under American protection from then on, which not only seriously undermined the jurisdiction of the Chinese government and alienated the unity of the Chinese people, but for Chinese Christians, this was especially an intolerable slander! Furthermore, what the American church protected was not all good people who "peacefully pursued their calling and obeying the laws." American missionaries did evil, and the Chinese government dared not interfere because it was bound by extraterritoriality. Even if Chinese Christians violated the law, the government often could not control them. Many rogues and bad guys relied on the protection of the American church to commit all kinds of crimes that oppressed the good. Even American missionaries had to admit these facts. (Note 8)
    On the other hand, this masterpiece of William and W.A.P. Martin was also appreciated by the British invaders. The religious provisions in the Sino-British Treaty of Tianjin were in fact a reprint of the American treaty. Afterwards, the British Bishop of Hong Kong deeply expressed his gratitude to the two of them in his letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury. (Note 9)
    American missionaries such as Bridgman, Parker, William, and W.A.P. Martin were so loyal to their country's bourgeois government and ruthlessly nailed the Chinese people to the cross! Regarding their "achievements," the American minister William Reed in 1858 made a summary in a letter to Secretary of State Cass. He wrote:
        "...In addition, I must mention that the efforts made by missionaries and those related to the missionary movement are very important to our country's interests. Without them as translators, official business cannot be handled. Without their help, I would simply be unable to fulfill my responsibilities here..."
        "The situation in 1844 was the same. The translators and assistants who helped Cushing handle official business at that time were all these missionaries. Bridgman, who had served as the main assistant to Marshall and Melane in 1853 and 1854, is still making great contributions. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to him for his help and constant valuable advice..."
    Tyler Dennett, the author of "Americans in Eastern Asia," continued from here:
        "The situation described by William Reed continued afterwards, until the end of the nineteenth century, there were almost always some American missionaries who held important positions in the Chinese embassy or consulates. In the vast majority of cases, the people who actually contacted Chinese officials were not so much these missionaries' nominal superiors as they were these American missionaries." (Note 10)
    Of course, during this period, American churches also ran some hospitals and other "charitable undertakings" in China. We should know that the reason they gave small favors to the Chinese was not for anything else, but precisely to "catch big fish." Rev. Parker, the pioneer of the American church's "charitable undertakings" in China and the first to open a hospital in China, once said that the purpose of opening hospitals was to "open up China with a lancet." (Note 11) This sentence is undoubtedly worth pondering repeatedly.
    Finally, it must be pointed out that although some American missionaries did come to China for the purpose of preaching, no matter what their subjective wishes were, they were still used by the American government as tools of aggression. J. Speicher, an American missionary who had preached in South China for forty years, frankly admitted this fact. He wrote:
        "There is a clear understanding between American consuls and missionaries that the latter are ordered to report the situation of their place of residence to the consuls at any time." (Note 12)
    Doesn't this already clearly state that almost every American missionary in China intentionally or unintentionally acted as an intelligence officer for their government?

　　一八五八年以前美籍传教士在中国的侵略活动
    余绳武
    近百年来美国教会在中国积极推行的所谓传教事业，从一开始便和美国资产阶级政府的对华侵略发生了难解难分的关系。美籍教士从最初便和他们的政府勾结在一起，甘心充当侵华先锋，用诈骗手段和政治压力，巧取豪夺，在我们历史上留下永洗不净的丑劣事迹。第一个来到中国的美籍基督教士裨治文牧师（E.C.Bridgman）就曾说过，他们之所以不远千里而来，“与其说是由于宗教的原因，毋宁说是由于政治的原因。”对于这批穿着道袍，利用宗教作幌子的黑衫党徒的真面貌，我们必须认识清楚。
    裨治文在一八三○年二月到达广州。他和艾比尔（D.Abeel）二人是首批来到中国的美籍教士。一八三二年他独力创办了一种期刊，名称是“中国丛报”（Chinese Repository），自任编辑兼主要撰稿人，内容专门向外国人尤其向美国人“介绍”当时中国各方面的情况，特别着重鼓吹侵略思想，以中国通的资格提供侵华具体方策。不仅外国商人曾从这个刊物中受益很多，甚至连当时对中国的认识还很模糊的美国政府，也曾深受《中国丛报》的教益。我们不当忘记，中美望厦不平等条约中许多款项，就是根据《中国丛报》所提供的意见拟定的。（注一）
    一八三四年广州又来了一位出色的美籍教士伯驾牧师（Peter Parker），他不久便在当地开设了一座眼科医院，生意一天天兴隆，于是伯驾便借此广交中国各阶层的人士，放手大做其收买人心的工作。伯驾在中国所作所为，一切都从“开放中国”，设法使美国经济政治势力侵入中国这一动机出发。鸦片战争前他就已向林则徐很“恳切”地建议，说只有和西方国家结个条约才能彻底解决中西间的纠纷。这就是说，不如自动用和平方式去满足他们的要求。战事发生后，伯驾见英国已先动手，便赶快跑回美国，向范布伦总统（Van Buren）及国务卿福赛斯（Forsyth）呼吁，说应该“直接并且毫不迟疑地派遣全权公使到清廷去”，但是当时美国国内正忙着选举总统，大家都没有太多的余力来注意这事。新政府成立后，伯驾复向新国务卿威伯士德（Daniel Webster）屡屡提起。不久南京条约的消息传来，美国政府认为时机已至，决定依照伯驾的办法遣使来华缔约，设法取得与英国同等的利益。（注二）
    一八四四年二月二十四日顾盛（Caleb Cushing）率领美国订约使团抵达澳门，伯驾、裨治文及另一个美籍教士威廉士（S.Wells Williams）都先后欣然就任顾盛的秘书与翻译员。（注三）在他们三人的协助下，中国被迫缔结了比南京条约更为苛刻的中美望厦条约。前面已经说过，该约的若干款项都是根据裨治文主编的《中国丛报》所提供的意见拟定的，单就这一事实来看，也可推知美籍教士在望厦条约中起着如何重要的作用了。
    在鸦片战争期间，许多美籍教士曾经趁火打劫，紧随英国军队的后面，利用侵略者的武装力量来扩张教会的势力；鼓浪屿、香港、舟山、宁波各地在战事尚未结束时，就先有了美籍传教士的足迹。（注四）美国教会在中国所采取的传教方式，就是这样一种与侵略者武装力量相配合的可耻方式！
    南京与望厦两个条约签订以后，传教士不仅得到在五口传教的“合法权利”，并且获得了严重损害中国主权的所谓治外法权。他们这时的兴高采烈，是完全可以想像的。美籍浸礼会教士沙克（Shuck），就曾在当时这样描写过内心的喜悦，他在给所属教会的信中写道：“我此刻得能向你报告一个光荣的消息，大不列颠已经和中国签订和约，这个异教的国度，现在终于被攻打开了。”伯驾也情不自禁，宣布“一个崭新的时代现在已经来临”。（注五）中国人民吃了侵略者的苦头，被迫缔结丧权辱国的条约，而美国教士反倒从中渔利，为中国的灾难欢欣鼓舞，伪善者的面貌，不是暴露得清清楚楚了吗？
    望厦条约缔结后，伯驾侵华有功，于次年荣任美驻华使馆秘书。同时他的妻子又是威伯士德的亲戚，靠着这一层裙带关系，他得以在外交界中渐露头角，终于在一八五五年九月正式就任驻华使节。担负起侵华的总责以后，他的第一件任务便是设法修订望厦条约，扩大美国在华既得利益。为了达到这一目的，他曾亲赴欧洲向英法当局表示美国愿和他们在中国充分合作的诚意。但大大使伯驾扫兴的，则是自他从欧洲返华以后，接二连三碰了几次不小的钉子。首先叶名琛不但不和他商谈修约，连面也不愿一见。接着伯驾去到福建，不料福建官吏也退还了美总统给咸丰的函件。从此以后，伯驾便撕下假面具，露出强盗的真面貌了。一八五六年十二月十二日，他向国务卿麦西（Marcy）提出一项恶毒的建议，主张由美国去占据台湾，法国占据朝鲜，英国重占舟山，待修约问题满意解决后再“归还”中国。麦西回答说，美国海军力量现在还不允许这样做，最好忍耐些，不要严重妨害中美间的“友好关系”。
    事实告诉我们，伯驾是连这种伪善的“友好关系”也不惜破坏的。当时皮尔斯总统（Pierce）任期将满，伯驾风闻自己不久也将被免职，因此更急于在卸任之前做出一番“英雄事业”。一八五七年二月十二日他向国务院建议说：
    “台湾在目前已经成为我们许多商人的一个极有兴趣的题目，它理应从这个伟大的西方商业国度得到比过去更多的注意才对；切盼合众国政府不要在这个关系着人道、文明、航业及商业各方面利益的，关于台湾的行动上退缩不前……”
    明明只是为了美国资产阶级的利益而阴谋侵占中国领土，却还说这也是为了维护“人道”，增进“文明”，天下能找出比这更无耻的花言巧语吗？圣经上教人诚实，现在伯驾牧师竟撒出这样的弥天大谎，这不是亵渎基督教义是什么？
    在三月十日的一件标明“秘密”字样的公函中，伯驾再一次露骨地表明了他的野心。他写道：
    “若一旦在加里福尼亚，日本及中国之间开辟了航线，这个煤的供应地（指台湾）将是非常有用的；显而易见，这些岛屿并不会长久隶属这个帝国，如果它一旦在政治上像在地理上一样脱离这个帝国，合众国就显然应该据有它，特别是因为关系着势力均衡的伟大原则的缘故。”
    伯驾这时只顾说得高兴，只顾追求“势力均衡”，把他最初的主张，即待修约问题解决后仍将台湾归还中国那回事早已忘到九霄云外去了！他甚至决定在未得本国政府同意前就派遣军官到台湾去，先在那儿升起星条旗来再说，他还说那样做“可能对未来有重大的关系”！
    另一方面，美国政府对这个问题则远不如伯驾那样热心。皮尔斯和麦西都考虑到美国在远东海军力量太弱，占领台湾一时不易办到。因此尽管伯驾如何慷慨陈词，说得如何天花乱坠，结果却被浇了一头冷水。并且不久布卡南（J.Buchanan）当选总统，列卫廉（William Reed）就任驻华公使，伯驾牧师终于怏怏而去。（注六）
    一八五八这一年，美国利用英法联军侵略中国的机会，强迫满清政府签订中美天津不平等条约，取得内地“游历”，增开口岸，改定关税，自由“传教”等特权。在这次订约过程中，美国教士也如在签订望厦条约时一样起了不可忽视的作用。美国公使列卫廉当时最重要的秘书，一个是威廉士，另一个是丁韪良牧师（W.A.P.Martin），中美天津条约中，差不多每一款当拟草时都曾参考这两位美籍教士的意见，尤其第二十九款从起草到签订完全是两人一手包办的杰作。这项宗教条款中规定“……嗣后所有安分传教习教之人，当一体矜恤保护，不可欺侮凌虐。凡遵照教规安分传习者，无论其为美国公民抑系华籍教徒，他人毋得骚扰。”满清政府鉴于经验的教训，对传教士早存戒心，所以最初总是不肯同意，列卫廉对这一款原也并不热心。最后全由于威廉士和丁韪良二人坚持不让，威逼利诱，满清全权大臣经不起他们恫吓，终于被迫接受。（注七）
    这样一项条款，首先当然是彻底改变了美籍教士在中国的地位。从此他们有条约作护符，有本国的炮舰作后盾，可以大摇大摆到中国任何地方去传教，干各种各样中国人民尝够了的好事去了！美籍教士只顾扩张他们传教的道路，竟不惜利用政治压力，断送掉中国的主权。既然明文规定“凡遵照教规安分教习者，无论其为美国公民抑系华籍教徒，他人毋得骚扰”，也就等于把中国的教徒从此划归美国保护，这不仅严重的破坏中国政府的管辖权，离间中国人民的团结，对于中国的教徒说，这尤其是不能忍受的诬蔑！再说美国教会所保护的事实上并不全是“遵照教规安分传习”的好人。美籍教士作恶，中国政府固然因为受治外法权的束缚不敢过问，就是中国籍的教徒触犯了法律，政府往往也还是管不着。许多流氓坏蛋曾经倚仗美国教会的庇护，做出各色各样欺压善良的罪行。这些事实，即使美国教士也不得不承认。（注八）
    另一方面，威廉士和丁韪良的这一杰作，同样也得到了英国侵略者的赏识。中英天津条约中关于宗教的规定，事实上完全是美约的再版。事后香港英国主教曾在其致坎特伯雷大主教的信中，深深表示过对他们两人的感激。（注九）
    裨治文、伯驾、威廉士、丁韪良等美国教士，就这样忠心耿耿充当本国资产阶级政府的走狗，残酷无情地把中国人民钉上了十字架！对于他们的“功绩”，一八五八年的美公使列卫廉曾在给国务卿盖斯（Cass）的信中作过一个总结。他写道：
        “……此外我必须提及，传教士及与传教运动有关系的那些人，他们
    所作的努力，对于我国的利益是非常重要的。若没有他们充当译员，公事
    就无法处理。没有他们的帮助，我在这里就简直无法履行我的责任。……”
        “一八四四年的情形亦复相同，当时帮助顾盛处理公务的译员和助手
    全都是这些教士。曾在一八五三年及五四年担任过马沙利（Marshall）和
    麦运（Melane）主要助手的裨治文，现在仍旧极有贡献。为了他的帮助和
    经常的可贵的忠告，我愿意乘此机会向他表示谢意……”
    “美国人在东亚”的作者德涅特从这儿又接下去说道：
        “列卫廉所描绘的情况以后仍在继续，直至十九世纪末年，差不多经
    常有一些美籍教士在驻华公使馆或各领事馆中担任重要的职务。在极大多
    数的情形下，真正和中国官吏接触的人与其说是这些教士的名义上的上峰
    ，毋宁说正是这些美籍教士。”（注十）
    当然，在这段时期中，美国教会也曾在中国办过一些医院和其他的“慈善事业”。我们应该知道，他们之所以向中国人施小惠不是为别的，而正是为了“钓大鱼”。美国教会在华“慈善事业”的鼻祖，第一个在中国开设医院的伯驾牧师就曾说过，他们开设医院的目的，是为了想要“用刃针来开放中国”。（注十一）这一句话，无疑是值得我们反复体味的。
    最后必须指出，虽然也有一部分美籍教士的确是为了传教而来到中国，但不管他们主观的愿望如何，仍旧是被美国政府利用来充作侵略工具了的。曾在华南传教四十年之久的美籍教士斯比丘（J.Speicher）坦白供认了这一事实。他写道：
        “在美国领事与传教士之间有一种明确的了解，后者奉命将他们所居
    地的情况随时报告领事。”（注十二）
    这岂不已经说得明明白白，差不多每一个在中国的美籍教士都有意无意充当了他们政府的情报人员吗？
