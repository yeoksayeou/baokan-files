　　The American imperialists are now stepping up their conspiracy for a unilateral peace treaty with Japan. U.S. President Truman has appointed Dulles as a special representative to lead his delegation to Japan on January 22 to carry out activities related to a unilateral peace treaty with Japan. The United States publicly began this illegal activity with Truman's statement at a press conference on September 14, 1950. At that press conference, Truman announced that he had authorized the State Department to discuss the procedural issues of the so-called peace treaty with Japan with other member states of the Far Eastern Commission. On October 26, Dulles, advisor to the U.S. State Department and war-monger, submitted a memorandum from the U.S. government on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan to Soviet Representative to the Security Council Malik. In this memorandum, the U.S. government proposed that the contracting states should be "any or all of the countries at war with Japan willing to make peace on the basis of the proposed and potentially agreeable terms," rather than all countries at war with Japan. This attempts to exclude the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, the two major countries at war with Japan, from the contracting states. Soviet Representative Malik submitted to Dulles a Soviet memorandum including six inquiries on November 20; the U.S. government gave the Soviet Union another memorandum on December 28, which, in addition to repeating the contents of its October 26 memorandum, openly denied China's important position on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan on the grounds that the United States had no diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. On December 4, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, issued a solemn statement on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, but based on subsequent actions by the United States, it still completely ignores the will of the Chinese people.
    The basic purpose of American imperialism's current eagerness to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan is to rearm Japan, revive Japanese militarism, and make it a new tool of aggression for American imperialism in Asia. Its nature is the same as the American attempt to arm West Germany. According to what the warmonger MacArthur said in his New Year's "Message" in Japan this year, "Your (referring to the Japanese) responsibility is to gather strength (meaning providing cannon fodder) together with other freedom-loving people (referring to the likes of Truman, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee) within the principles of the United Nations (should be read as the United States) to repel violence (should be read as attacking peaceful people)." According to the statement made by the warmonger Dulles on January 22 before leaving the United States for Japan, Japan is to "share various responsibilities" (that is, to provide cannon fodder). Obviously, the most direct reason for the United States' current eagerness to rearm Japan is the failure of its war of aggression against Korea. The lessons of the Korean War have made American imperialism realize that it is impossible to realize its aggression plan relying solely on the power of American imperialism itself and its currently mobilized puppet states. American imperialism, which originally thought it could run rampant in the world, now finds itself definitely at a disadvantage in the face of the powerful peace and democracy camp. Whether in Europe or Asia, the outwardly strong but inwardly weak and dilemma-ridden embarrassing situation of American imperialism has been completely exposed. American imperialism believes that in order to realize its world hegemony plan, it must arm West Germany in Europe and arm Japan in Asia, so as to use the German and Japanese people to risk their lives for it on the front lines.
    The American imperialist conspiracy to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan in order to rearm Japan has aroused resolute opposition from China, the Soviet Union, peace-loving countries in Asia, the Japanese people, and the people of the world. This is because this action by the United States completely violates all important international agreements concerning Japan since World War II, threatens the security of China, the Soviet Union, and peace-loving countries in Asia, and nakedly drives the Japanese people to their deaths.
    According to the memorandums that the US government gave to the Soviet government on October 26 and December 28, 1950, the US government has completely violated the international obligations it has undertaken. On January 1, 1942, the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union and many other countries that signed the Declaration of the United Nations guaranteed not to make peace with the enemy countries alone, but the United States is now actively carrying out a unilateral peace treaty with Japan. The Cairo Declaration signed by China, Britain and the United States on December 1, 1943, and the Potsdam Proclamation signed by them on July 26, 1945 (this proclamation was also signed by the Soviet Union) decided to return Taiwan and Penghu to China; The Yalta Agreement signed on February 11, 1945 also determined the status of Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. The United States is now trying to overturn them. The Potsdam Proclamation stipulates that the occupying forces should withdraw from Japan after the conclusion of the peace treaty, but the United States is trying to occupy Japan for a long time. On June 19, 1947, the Far Eastern Commission stipulated that Japan shall not maintain land, sea, or air forces, but the United States has not only partially armed Japan, but is also attempting to arm Japan on a large scale. The above-mentioned international agreements are all major achievements obtained by the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and all peace-loving people in the world through enormous sacrifices in World War II, aimed at safeguarding peace in China, Asia, and the world. These agreements also guarantee the prospects for the peaceful development of Japan. The American imperialists brazenly undermined these international agreements, which is to destroy the paved track of peace and attempt to guide Japan towards absolute destruction.
    China and the Soviet Union have a particularly important position on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, made a solemn statement on this point in his statement issued on December 4, 1950, saying: "Since September 18, 1931, Japanese imperialism has armed aggression against China, ravaged our vast territory, and caused great sacrifices to the lives and property of our people. After eight years of heroic resistance, the Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism and won the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, the preparation, formulation, and signing of the peace treaty with Japan must be participated by our People's Republic of China, which is a matter of course." On the Soviet side, Japanese imperialism invaded the eastern territory of the Soviet Union along with other imperialists after the October Revolution, and then threatened the eastern border of the Soviet Union for a long time. In World War II, it was also the Soviet Union that sent troops to Northeast China on August 9, 1945, crushing the main force of the Japanese army—the Kwantung Army—that forced Japanese imperialism to surrender quickly. Therefore, excluding China and the Soviet Union from the issue of the peace treaty with Japan is completely ignoring the historical facts since the war against Japan, which is completely unreasonable.
    The US plan to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan in order to arm Japan will of course arouse the firmest and most severe opposition from the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries, and will cause serious consequences. For about fifty years before Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, Japanese imperialism had been the most important and most vicious enemy of the Chinese people. The Chinese people only won victory after a long and arduous struggle, and of course cannot tolerate the United States rearming Japan and continuing to be the enemy of the Chinese people. For the same secure reasons, the Soviet people will never agree to have an aggressor raised again on its eastern border. Everyone knows that one of the main purposes of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between China and the Soviet Union is to jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese armed aggression. Japanese imperialism not only invaded China and threatened the Soviet Union in the past, but also invaded other Asian countries. Japan invaded Korea when it began its invasion of China. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, Japanese imperialism once occupied Vietnam, the Philippines, Burma, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaya, and threatened India, Ceylon, Australia, and New Zealand. All the land in the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" had been regarded by Japanese imperialism as its colonies. The people of Asian countries still have clear memories of the painful experience of this period, and they will never allow the embers of Japanese militarism to rekindle. It is conceivable that if the United States stubbornly insists on realizing the conspiracy to rearm Japan, then the powerful China, the powerful Soviet Union, and the powerful Asian people's forces will certainly not be able to ignore it, and the result will certainly create a tense situation in the East, and the Japanese people who are used as victims by the United States will bear the brunt.
    Unilateral reconciliation and rearmament are obviously extremely unfavorable and extremely dangerous to the Japanese people. Although American imperialism and the reactionary Japanese group are now deceiving the Japanese people, as if a separate peace treaty with the United States can find a way out for the current difficult situation of the Japanese people, the facts seen by the Japanese people are completely the opposite. In fact, Japan's separate peace treaty with the United States is not a way to survive, but a road to death that has already been doomed. First of all, politically speaking, if the United States and Japan conclude a separate peace treaty, it means that Japan not only continues to be in a state of war with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, but also further means that Japan has stood on the side of American imperialism that is hostile to the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union. Of course, what the Japanese people hope for is the friendship of China and the Soviet Union, and to live in peace with each other, rather than repeating the old path of Japanese militarism that has been miserably defeated. Of course, there are still a small number of extremely reactionary elements in Japan, such as Shigeru Yoshida and Hitoshi Ashida, who still dream of reviving Japanese militarism with the support of American imperialism and rebuilding an Eastern fascist empire in a new world war. But this is a dream. Because Japanese imperialism, after half a century of operation, finally failed and surrendered in the war of aggression, and the American imperialism, which is now relied on by the Japanese reactionaries, is also in a defeated position in the world, and it is trying to rely on the remnants of the defeated Japanese and German fascists to save itself. Isn't this a ridiculous cycle of dreams? Economically, if Japan is hostile to China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asia, it will inevitably fall into an inextricable predicament. Not only the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of Japan can see this truth clearly, but also a part of the Japanese bourgeoisie can see it clearly. The US policy is to make Japan a US colony, that is, to make Japan with a population of more than 70 million a market for US goods. However, for Japan, a highly industrialized defeated country, where can Japanese industry find its own market when all its foreign markets have been lost and its domestic market has been occupied by the United States? Japan, which lacks raw materials, relies on Asian raw material supply to survive as an industrial country. The Japanese economy is obviously a component of the Asian economy, not the American economy. Of course, this does not mean that Japan should take the old road of war and aggression, but should take the new road of peaceful trade. History has concluded that the old road of war and aggression will not work. Japan can only have a new future if it takes the new road of peaceful trade. Taking the whole of Asia, with such a large population and such abundant resources, especially under the new historical condition that the Chinese revolution has been successful, as long as Japan becomes a peaceful industrial country, the Chinese people and the Asian people are willing and able to give a way out for Japan's peaceful industry under the conditions of equality and mutual benefit. If Japan is rearmed under the coercion of American imperialism and dreams of aggression against Asian countries, especially against China, then it will inevitably be a dead end for Japan.
    Today, Japan has been dragged by American imperialism to the crossroads of war and peace. For the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, there is no more important historical task than opposing unilateral reconciliation and rearmament, striving for a comprehensive and just peace treaty, and striving for the friendship between Japan and the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union. This is an extremely serious political struggle, and the Japanese people must win this struggle in order to save themselves.
    The current situation is beneficial to the self-help struggle of the Japanese people. American imperialism has been disastrously defeated by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, thus completely exposing the original form of a paper tiger. The "prestige" of American imperialism has plummeted. The imperialist camp has therefore begun to split, and the reactionary ruling group in the United States has therefore become increasingly chaotic. Now, the people of the world have seen that American imperialism is not only necessary to be defeated, but also able to be defeated. The active unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the active attempt to arm Japan by American imperialism today does not mean the strength of American imperialism, but its weakness. The Japanese people should see that the United States' conspiracy to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan today is to save its failure in Asia with the sacrifice of the Japanese people. For the United States, a robber whose defeat is set, the Japanese people should not only hate it, but also despise and despise it. The Shigeru Yoshida and other traitors in Japan have also become very isolated. Their policy of colonizing Japan makes it unacceptable even to patriotic elements among the bourgeoisie. Under such circumstances, the Japanese people, in coordination with the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the Korean people, are able to crush the conspiracy of American imperialism and the Yoshida government to conclude a unilateral treaty; and are able to obtain a comprehensive and just treaty that conforms to the interests of the Japanese people.
    The Chinese and Soviet people have always hoped to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, so as to restore the peaceful life of the Japanese people as soon as possible. In the past few years, it was the United States that prevented the conclusion of a real peace treaty with Japan. Its purpose at that time was to occupy Japan for a long time. On this point, Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on December 4, 1950 made a full explanation. He said: "According to the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on February 14, 1950, the governments of China and the Soviet Union agreed to jointly obtain the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan with other allied countries during the Second World War in the shortest possible time. This shows that the basic policy of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is to strive to conclude a common peace treaty with Japan in the shortest possible time, so as to end the state of war with Japan as soon as possible and enable the Japanese people to obtain democracy and peace as soon as possible. In contrast, in order to implement a long-term military occupation of Japan, the US government has adopted a delaying policy on the peace treaty with Japan. Since 1947, the US government has repeatedly attempted to reverse the procedure for concluding the peace treaty with Japan, to undermine The principle that the peace treaty with Japan should first be discussed and prepared jointly by the foreign ministers of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, and to undermine the principle of unanimous voting by major powers. Now, the US government is not only attempting to undermine the procedure for the peace treaty with Japan, but also further attempting to subvert the basis of the common peace treaty with Japan." Therefore, judging from the course of the delay of the peace treaty with Japan, it is enough to prove that American imperialism is the vicious enemy of the Japanese people.
    All the Chinese people are closely watching and firmly opposing the US's criminal conspiracy to rearm Japan, and are fighting for a comprehensive and just treaty, a non-militaristic and democratic Japan, in accordance with international agreements, uniting the people of Eastern countries and the Japanese people. We believe that this just struggle of the Chinese people will surely be victorious, and the treacherous and aggressive actions of American imperialism will suffer painful failures, just like its past crimes of using Chiang Kai-shek to invade China and personally invading Korea.

　　粉碎美国重新武装日本的阴谋，争取全面的公正的对日和约
    美帝国主义现正加紧片面对日和约的阴谋。美总统杜鲁门已任命杜勒斯为特别代表，率领其代表团于一月二十二日离美赴日，进行片面对日和约的活动。美国公开进行这一非法的活动，是一九五○年九月十四日杜鲁门在记者招待会上的声明开始的。杜鲁门在这个招待会上宣布业已授权国务院，就所谓对日和约的程序问题，与远东委员会其他会员国家，进行讨论。十月二十六日，美国国务院顾问、战争贩子杜勒斯就以美国政府关于对日和约问题的备忘录一件递交苏联驻安理会代表马立克。在这一备忘录中，美国政府提出缔约国家是所谓“任何或一切愿意在所建议的和可能获得协议的基础上媾和的对日作战国家”，而不是全部对日作战国家。这就是企图把中华人民共和国和苏联两个主要对日作战国家排斥于缔约国家之外。苏联代表马立克于十一月二十日将苏联包括六点询问的备忘录交杜勒斯；美国政府于十二月二十八日又给苏联一份备忘录，除重复其十月二十六日备忘录的内容外，并公然以美国与中华人民共和国无外交关系为理由，否认中国在对日和约问题上的重要地位。十二月四日我中央人民政府外交部长周恩来曾就对日和约问题发表庄严声明，但是，根据以后美国的行动看来，美国仍然完全忽视中国人民的意志。
    美帝国主义现在急于片面对日媾和的基本目的，是在于重新武装日本，复活日本的军国主义，使之充当美帝国主义在亚洲的新的侵略工具。其性质，与美国之企图武装西德相同。照战贩麦克阿瑟在今年新年在日本所发表的《文告》的说法，就是：“你们（指日本人）的职责就是在联合国（应读作美国）的原则以内与其他珍爱自由的人（指杜鲁门、蒋介石、李承晚之流）共同聚集力量（就是出炮灰），以击退暴力（应读为进攻和平人民）。”如果按照战贩杜勒斯一月二十二日离美赴日声明中的说法，就是要日本“分担各种责任”（也就是要日本出炮灰）。很显然，美国现在之急于重新武装日本，最直接的原因，是它所发动的侵略朝鲜的战争的失败。朝鲜战争的教训，使美帝国主义知道，单靠美帝国主义自己及其现在已经动员的仆从国家的力量，是不可能实现它的侵略计划的。原来自以为可以横行世界的美帝国主义，现在发现自己在强大的和平民主阵线面前，是确定地处于劣势了。无论在欧洲和亚洲，美帝国主义那种外强中干、进退两难的狼狈状况，已经是完全暴露了。美帝国主义认为：为要实现它的世界霸权计划，必须在欧洲武装西德，在亚洲武装日本，以便利用德国人民和日本人民去替它冒险打前阵。
    美帝国主义片面对日媾和以便重新武装日本的阴谋，引起中国、苏联、亚洲各爱好和平的国家、日本人民和全世界人民坚决的反对。这就是因为美国这一行动，完全违反自第二次世界大战以来有关于日本的一切重要的国际协定，威胁中国、苏联及亚洲各爱好和平国家的安全，赤裸裸地把日本人民赶上死路。
    根据美国政府于一九五○年十月二十六日以及同年十二月二十八日给苏联政府的备忘录，美国政府已完全违背它自己所承担的国际义务。一九四二年一月一日，美、英、中、苏及其他许多在联合国宣言上签署的国家，曾保证不与敌国单独媾和，而美国现在却积极进行片面的对日和约。一九四三年十二月一日，由中、英、美签字的开罗宣言，以及它们于一九四五年七月二十六日签字的波茨坦公告（这个公告并有苏联签署）已决定将台湾和澎湖交还中国；一九四五年二月十一日签订的雅尔塔协定，也决定了南库页岛和千岛群岛的地位。美国现在都企图加以推翻。波茨坦公告规定在缔结和约以后占领军应自日本撤出，而美国却企图长期占领日本。一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会规定，日本不得保有陆、海、空军，而美国却不但已经部分地武装日本，并且企图大规模地武装日本。上述这些国际协定，都是中国人民、苏联人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，在第二次世界大战中，经过浩大牺牲所得到的、旨在保障中国、亚洲和世界和平的重大成就。这些协定，也保障着日本和平发展的前途。美帝国主义悍然破坏这些国际协定，就是破坏已经铺好的和平轨道，企图引导日本走向绝对的毁灭。
    中国和苏联在对日和约问题上，有特殊重要的地位。就中国方面来说，我中央人民政府外交部长周恩来于一九五○年十二月四日所发表的声明，对于这一点有过郑重的说明，他说：“自一九三一年九月十八日以来，日本帝国主义武装侵略中国，蹂躏我广大领土，使我国人民生命财产，遭受重大牺牲。中国人民经过八年英勇抗战，击败了日本帝国主义，取得了抗日战争的胜利。因此对日和约的准备，拟制与签订，我中华人民共和国必须参加，乃属当然之事。”就苏联方面来说，日本帝国主义曾在十月革命以后与其他帝国主义一道侵略过苏联的东部领土，以后又长期威胁着苏联的东部边疆。在第二次世界大战中，也是苏联于一九四五年八月九日出兵东北，粉碎了日本军队的主力——关东军，才迫使日本帝国主义迅速投降。因此，排斥中苏两国于对日和约问题之外，就是完全忽视对日战争以来的历史事实，这是完全不合理的。
    美国片面对日媾和以武装日本的计划，当然要引起中国、苏联和亚洲各国人民的最坚决最严厉的反对，并将造成严重的后果。在一九四五年八月十五日日本投降以前，约五十年间，日本帝国主义一直是中国人民最主要和最凶恶的敌人。中国人民经过长久的艰苦斗争才得到胜利，当然不能容忍美国重新武装日本，继续做中国人民的敌人。根据同样安全的理由，苏联人民也绝对不会同意在它的东面又被扶起一个侵略者。大家知道，中国和苏联订立友好同盟互助条约的主要目的之一，正是共同防止日本武装侵略的再起。日本帝国主义过去不仅侵略中国，威胁苏联，而且侵略了亚洲其他国家。日本在开始侵略中国时就侵略了朝鲜。一九四一年太平洋战争爆发之后，日本帝国主义曾经侵占越南、菲律宾、缅甸、印尼、泰国和马来亚，并威胁印度、锡兰、澳洲和纽西兰。在所谓“大东亚共荣圈”内的一切土地，都曾被日本帝国主义视为它的殖民地。亚洲各国人民对于这个时期的痛苦经历，记忆还很清楚，他们也绝对不允许日本军国主义势力的死灰复燃。可以想像：如果美国一意孤行，硬使重新武装日本的阴谋实现，那末强大的中国、强大的苏联和强大的亚洲人民力量一定不能加以漠视，其结果一定是造成东方的紧张形势，而被美国当作牺牲品的日本人民将要首当其冲。
    片面媾和和重新武装，对日本人民显然是极端不利而且是极端危险的。美帝国主义和日本的反动集团现在虽然欺骗日本人民，好像与美国单独媾和，就能为日本人民现存的困难地位找到一条出路，但是日本人民看到的事实，却是完全相反。事实上日本对美国单独媾和不但不是什么生路，而且是一条已经注定的死路。首先从政治上来说，如果美日单独媾和，这就表示日本不但与中华人民共和国和苏联继续处于战争状态，而且进一步表示日本已站到敌视中苏两大强国的美帝国主义一边。毫无疑问，日本人民所盼望的是中国和苏联的友情，是彼此和平相处，而不是重复已经惨败了的日本军国主义的老路。当然，在日本还有一小部分极端反动的分子，如吉田茂、芦田均之流还梦想在美帝国主义扶持之下，复活日本军国主义，并在新的世界战争中重建一个东方法西斯帝国。但这是一个梦想。因为日本帝国主义积半世纪的经营，终于在侵略战争中失败投降，而现在被日本反动派依为靠山的美帝国主义，亦已在全世界处于失败的地位，它正欲反过来依赖已经失败的日本和德国法西斯的残余势力以自救。这不是可笑的循环的幻梦么？从经济方面来说，日本如果与中国、苏联和亚洲人民为敌，它必然陷入一筹莫展的困境。这个道理，不但是日本的工人、农民、知识分子看得清楚，日本的一部分资产阶级也能看得清楚。美国的政策要日本成为美国的殖民地，即要七千多万人口的日本成为美国商品的市场。但是，对于已经高度工业化的战败国日本来说，在自己全部国外市场已经丧失，国内市场又被美国侵占的情形下，日本工业又到那里去找自己的市场呢？原料缺乏的日本，作为一个工业国家来说，是依靠亚洲的原料供给来生存的。日本经济，显然是亚洲经济的构成部分，而不是美洲经济的构成部分。当然，这并不是说，日本应当走战争侵略的老路，而是应当走和平贸易的新路。战争侵略老路之行不通，历史已经作了结论。日本只有走和平贸易的新路，才有新生的前途。以整个亚洲来说，人口如此之多，资源如此之富，特别在中国革命已经成功这一新的历史条件下，只要日本成为一个和平工业国家，中国人民和亚洲人民对于日本的和平工业，就愿意而且能够在平等互利的条件下给予出路。如果日本在美帝国主义挟持下，重新武装起来，梦想对亚洲各国，首先是对中国进行侵略，那么就必然是日本的死路。
    今天日本业已被美帝国主义拖上了战争与和平的十字路口。在日本工人阶级和日本人民面前，再没有比反对片面媾和和重新武装，争取全面的公正的和约，争取日本与中苏两大国的友善，更为重大的历史任务了。这是一个极其严重的政治斗争，日本人民必须在这一斗争中取得胜利，才能自救。
    目前形势，对日本人民的自救斗争是有利的。美帝国主义在朝鲜已被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打得惨败，因而完全暴露了纸老虎的原形。美帝国主义的“威风”已一落万丈。帝国主义阵营已因此开始分化，美国反动统治集团内部也因此日趋混乱。现在，全世界人民都已经看到，美帝国主义不但是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的了。美帝国主义今天积极进行对日片面媾和，积极图谋武装日本，并不是表示美帝国主义的强大，而是表示它的虚弱。日本人民应当看到，美国今日对日片面媾和的阴谋，是想用日本人民的牺牲，以挽救它在亚洲的失败。对于美国这个败局已定的强盗，日本人民不仅应当加以仇视，而且应当加以鄙视和蔑视。在日本国内卖国求荣的吉田茂之流也已经十分孤立。他们所执行的殖民地化日本的政策，使资产阶级中的有爱国心的分子也不能接受。在这种情况下，日本人民在中国人民、苏联人民、朝鲜人民配合之下，是能够粉碎美帝国主义与吉田政府缔结片面和约的阴谋；能够得到符合于日本人民利益的全面的公正的和约的。
    中国人民和苏联人民从来就希望尽早缔结对日和约，以便尽早恢复日本人民的和平生活。而在过去几年之间，阻止缔结真正的对日和约的，正是美国。它那时的目的，在于长期占领日本。关于这一点，一九五○年十二月四日周外长的声明曾经作了充分的说明。他说：“根据一九五○年二月十四日中华人民共和国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟友好同盟互助条约，中、苏两国政府同意与第二次世界战争时期其他盟国于尽可能的短时期内共同取得对日和约的缔结。由此可以表明，中华人民共和国中央人民政府的基本方针是在力求于尽可能的短期内，缔结共同对日和约，以便早日结束对日战争状态，使日本人民早日获得民主与和平。与此相反，美国政府为了实行长期的对日军事占领，关于对日和约采取了拖延政策。美国政府自一九四七年以来，屡次企图颠倒缔结对日和约的程序，破坏对日和约应先经由中、苏、美、英四国外长会议共同讨论准备的原则，并破坏大国一致的表决原则。现在，美国政府不仅企图破坏对日和约的程序，而且进一步企图推翻共同对日和约的基础。”因此，单从对日和约被拖延的经过看来，也足以证明美帝国主义是日本人民凶恶的敌人。
    全中国人民正在密切注视并坚决反对美国重新武装日本的罪恶阴谋，并为按照国际协议，团结东方各国人民和日本人民，争取全面的公正的和约，争取非军国主义的民主的日本而奋斗。我们相信，中国人民的这个正义的奋斗一定能够得到胜利，而美帝国主义的背信弃义的侵略行为，必将如它在过去利用蒋介石侵略中国，以及亲自出马侵略朝鲜的罪行一样，遭受惨痛的失败。
