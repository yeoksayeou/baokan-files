　　Our Life Gets Better Day by Day
    We Will Never Fall Into the Imperialist Trap
To the Editor:
    Since liberation, we have all been allocated houses and land, and we have reclaimed livestock and farm tools from the landlords. Our life is getting better day by day! We have enough to eat and wear, and every year is like a year, every festival is like a festival, and our days are like real days. With the improvement of our lives, everyone has a desire to learn culture. In the past year, our forty-one male and female students have made great achievements. Hired farmhand Liu Fuhai and village chairman Liu Wansheng, who were illiterate before, can now recognize about 1,500 characters. Even old Mrs. Guo, who is over fifty years old, can recognize eight or nine hundred characters. Many people have learned to read newspapers, write letters, and keep accounts.
    A few days ago, the Ministry of Education of our Central People's Government issued another instruction regarding the learning of us farmers. Everyone was overjoyed when they heard it! At first, we thought that it would be enough to recognize a few characters for farming! Now, we see that there are elementary classes, advanced classes, worker-peasant rapid middle schools, and People's University. Everyone said that we must study hard so that we can go to university in the future.
    Because of participating in learning, we have understood many principles and care about our country. We all clearly know that now the American devils want to come and destroy our good days again. But they are blind and have miscalculated. The recent victory in Korea has taught them a great lesson, making these shrimp soldiers and crab generals flee in panic, looking like nothing! Unable to cope, they released a smokescreen, saying that they would form a "three-person committee" to "cease fire," wanting to repeat the set of tricks they taught "Chiang Kai-shek" three years ago. We know that at this critical juncture, we must not listen to any tune they sing or watch any tricks they play. We will never fall into their trap again. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement. Korea belongs to the Korean people.
    All the winter school students in our central village, in addition to working hard to produce more grain and strengthen our country, unanimously guarantee in our studies:
    (1) To run the winter school well, and ensure that all students will transfer to people's schools by next spring, with an average of 300 characters recognized by each person in the winter school. To have 15 people recognizing more than 1,000 characters, reaching the graduation level of the elementary class.
    (2) While learning culture, we must also seize the time to learn about current affairs, and often publicize what we know to the masses.
    (3) To do a good job in sideline production, do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, protect people's security, and resolutely smash American imperialist aggression.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　All Winter School Students of the Central Village, Second District, Wuchang County, Songjiang Province

　　我们生活一天比一天好
    决不上帝国主义的圈套编辑同志：
    解放后，我们都分了房子分了地，向地主要回了牲口和农具，我们的生活一天比一天好起来啦！有吃有穿，真是年像年，节像节，日子像个日子样。生活改善了，谁都有了学习文化的要求，这一年来，我们四十一名男女学员都有了很大的成绩。雇农刘福海、村主席刘万生，从一字不识，到现在，都认了一千五百字左右。连五十多岁的老郭太太也认了八、九百字。很多人都学会了看报、写信、记账。
    前几天咱中央人民政府教育部关于我们庄稼人学习的事又发布了指示。大伙儿听到后可乐啦！起先我们想，认几个庄稼字就行啦！现在一看，又是初级班，又是高级班，还有工农速成中学、人民大学。大家说，非好好念念不可，将来也上上大学。
    由于参加了学习，我们明白了很多道理，关心咱们的国家。我们大伙清楚的知道，现在美国鬼子又想来破坏我们的好日子。但是，他们瞎了眼，错打了算盘，最近朝鲜的胜利就给他们一个很大的教训，弄得这些虾兵蟹将屁滚尿流，啥也不像啦！他们招架不了，就放出烟幕，说什么成立“三人委员会”要“停火”，想重复前三年教给“蒋介石”的那一套。我们知道，在这种紧要关头，就是他唱什么曲也不能听，耍什么把戏也不能看，决不再上他的圈套。我们坚决拥护周外长的严正声明。朝鲜，是属于朝鲜人民的。
    我们中心屯冬学的全体学员，除了努力生产，多打粮食，增强我们国家的力量外，在学习上我们一致保证：
    （一）搞好冬学，到明春保证全部转入民校，在冬学中平均每人认三百字。能有十五名认一千字以上，达到初级班毕业程度。
    （二）在学习文化同时，也要抓紧学时事，而且经常把我们知道的向群众进行宣传。
    （三）搞好副业生产，做好拥军优属工作，保护人民治安，坚决粉碎美帝侵略。
                            松江省五常县二区中心屯全体冬学学员
