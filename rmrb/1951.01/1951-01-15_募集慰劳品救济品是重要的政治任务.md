　　The China Peace Committee, committed to World Peace, Anti-American Aggression, has decided to launch a large-scale movement throughout the country to solicit慰劳品 and relief supplies, to express sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting arduously in the icy and snowy conditions, and to provide relief to the vast number of Korean refugees lacking clothing, food, and housing during the winter. This is a new and significant political task in the Chinese people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
    The struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, as well as the entire Korean people, on the Korean battlefield is worthy of the heartfelt gratitude of the Chinese people. Their great victory on the Korean battlefield not only ensured the independence of Korea but also made great contributions to the security of China, the liberation struggle of oppressed people throughout Asia, and world peace. When U.S. imperialism, along with its puppet states, concentrated its currently available forces and, under the banner of the "United Nations," launched an invasion of Korea, it fully believed that it could smoothly occupy all of Korea and realize its dream of invading China and Asia. The Korean War of Resistance over the past six months has completely bankrupted this aggressive plan of U.S. imperialism. The myth of U.S. imperialism's strength and invincibility has been completely shattered. Even representatives of big capitalists like Hoover and Taft consider the world hegemony plan of the Truman clique impossible. This victory was achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the entire Korean people, under extremely difficult conditions, with extraordinary heroism and a great spirit of self-sacrifice, through a cruel struggle. The慰劳 of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and the relief to the Korean people, represent the Chinese people's infinite admiration, gratitude, and support for them.
    The primary significance of the soliciting慰劳品 and relief supplies movement for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army is spiritual, while for the large number of Korean refugees, it is primarily material. Every Chinese compatriot living in safety must remember: the destruction by U.S. imperialism in Korea is unprecedentedly barbaric and devastating. Many towns and villages have become ruins, and millions of Korean people are today in a tragic situation of starvation, cold, helplessness, and displacement. Of course, the heroic Korean people have not succumbed to this; news from the Korean front continuously reports the touching deeds of the Korean people persisting in the struggle against the U.S. under extremely difficult conditions. But they need a large amount of assistance to resist the cold and hunger of the winter and spring seasons, to restore housing, and to restore transportation and production. The more victorious the war, the more people need relief, and the wider the area. Therefore, now that most of Korea has been liberated and the climate is at its coldest, it is entirely necessary for the China Peace Committee, committed to World Peace, Anti-American Aggression, to launch a nationwide campaign to solicit large quantities of grain, cotton, cloth, and cash.
    Soliciting慰劳品 and relief supplies must, of course, rely on voluntarism, and there must be no coercion of any kind. All phenomena of apportionment and the forced donation of one's own necessities are unreasonable and should be avoided. There is no doubt that such a completely just act of expressing sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and providing relief to Korean refugees, will surely win the sympathy of the broad masses of the Chinese people. As long as we carry out sufficient propaganda and explanation and mobilize all 475 million people, we will certainly be able to solicit a large amount of慰劳品 and relief supplies. But the need is urgent, and our actions must be swift. National people's organizations should immediately discuss the call of the China Peace Committee, committed to World Peace, Anti-American Aggression, and strive to complete this important political task in the shortest possible time.

　　募集慰劳品救济品是重要的政治任务
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，决定在全国发起大规模的募集慰劳品救济品运动，来慰劳在冰天雪地中艰苦作战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，来救济在冬天缺少衣被食粮房屋的广大的朝鲜难民。这是中国人民抗美援朝运动的一个新的有重大意义的政治任务。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军以及全朝鲜的人民，在朝鲜战场上的斗争，是值得中国人民衷心感谢的。他们在朝鲜战场上的伟大胜利，不仅保障了朝鲜的独立，而且对中国的安全，对全亚洲被压迫人民的解放斗争，对全世界的和平，都作了伟大的贡献。美帝国主义挟其仆从国家，集中其目前所可能集中的兵力，盗用“联合国”的旗号，在朝鲜发动侵略的时候，曾经满以为可以一帆风顺地占领全朝鲜，实现其侵略中国和亚洲的梦想。半年多来的朝鲜抗战，使美帝国主义的这个侵略计划，完全破产。美帝国主义强大无敌的神话，已经全部戳穿了。杜鲁门之流的世界霸权计划，连胡佛、塔夫脱那样的大资本家的代表，也认为不可能了。这个胜利，是中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和全朝鲜人民，在极艰苦的条件下，以非凡的英雄气概，伟大的自我牺牲的精神，经过残酷的斗争才得来的。中国人民对于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的慰劳，对于朝鲜人民的救济，就是表示中国人民对于他们的无限的敬佩、感激和拥护。
    募集慰劳品救济品运动，对于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的主要意义是精神上的，对于为数众多的朝鲜难民的主要意义是物质上的。每个过着安全生活的中国同胞要记住：美帝国主义在朝鲜的破坏，是空前野蛮、空前惨重的。许多城镇乡村成了废墟，千百万的朝鲜人民今天是陷于饥寒交迫、孤苦流离的悲惨境地。当然，英勇的朝鲜人民并没有因此而畏缩；来自朝鲜前线的消息，不断报道朝鲜人民在万分困苦下坚持抗美斗争的可歌可泣的事迹。但是他们需要大量的援助，来抵抗冬春二季的寒冷和饥饿，来恢复房屋，恢复交通和生产。战争愈胜利，需要救济的人口愈多，面积愈广。因此，在目前朝鲜大部已经得到解放，而气候最为寒冷的时候，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会发起在全中国大量募集粮食、棉花、布匹和现金，是完全必要的。
    募集慰劳品救济品当然要依靠自愿，不能有任何的强迫行为。一切摊派的现象和勉强捐出自己的必需品的现象，都是不合理的，应该避免的。毫无疑问，慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，救济朝鲜难民，这样完全正义的行为，必然会得到中国广大人民的同情。只要经过充分的宣传解释，把四亿七千五百万人发动起来之后，一定可以募集大量慰劳品救济品。但是需要是迫切的，我们的行动必须迅速。全国人民团体应当立即讨论中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的号召，为争取在最短期内完成这一重大的政治任务而努力。
