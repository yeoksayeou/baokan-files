　　Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital Accepts Criticism
    Will Convene Representatives' Meeting to Review Work

To the Editorial Comrades:

    The letter from "A Group of Patients" published in your newspaper on the 24th of this month provided many valuable opinions to our hospital. This kind of well-intentioned criticism is a concrete manifestation of cherishing and helping us. We were very excited and pleased to read it. Now, on behalf of Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital, in addition to sincerely accepting the opinions raised, I would like to extend our respects to your newspaper and the comrades who offered the opinions.

    Today's Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital has severed ties with imperialism and is a people's hospital run by the Chinese people themselves. We hope that comrades will often help us so that we can run this hospital well in order to better serve the people.

    We are now working with the hospital's trade union to study and prepare to convene a meeting of representatives from all departments of the hospital in order to thoroughly and deeply review the shortcomings of our hospital, gain experience and lessons, and determine the future direction of our hospital's efforts.

    Details will be provided to you after the review so that we can publicly respond to readers.
        
        Sincerely,
            Zhang Zirong, President of Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital

　　道济医院接受批评
    将召开代表会检讨工作应编辑同志：
    本月二十四日，贵报刊载“一群患者”的信，对我院提供了不少宝贵意见。这种善意的批评，正是爱护和帮助我们的具体表现。我们看了非常兴奋和愉快。现在我代表道济医院，除了竭诚接受所提意见外，并谨向贵报及提意见的同志，致以敬礼。
    今天的道济医院，已是和帝国主义割断了关系，由我中国人民自办的人民医院。我们希望同志们经常帮助我们，使我们能够办好这个医院，以达到更好地为人民服务的目的。
    现在我们正邀同本院工会，研究并准备召开本院各部门代表会，以求彻底和深刻地来检讨我院的缺点，取得经验教训，决定我院今后的努力方向。
    详情俟检讨后再告诉你们，以便公开答复读者。
        此致敬礼
            北京道济医院院长  张子荣
