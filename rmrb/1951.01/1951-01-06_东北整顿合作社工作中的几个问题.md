Several Problems in the Rectification of Cooperatives in Northeast China
Northeast Cooperative Headquarters

I. On the Rationalization of Business Operations

Over the past year, the business of cooperatives in Northeast China has seen tremendous development. In the first half of 1950, the total retail sales of cooperatives reached 138.81 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below), exceeding 1.7 times the total retail sales in 1949. The total sales of agricultural and sideline products by cooperatives in the first half of this year reached 61.759 billion yuan, exceeding 48% of the total sales of agricultural and sideline products in 1949. However, in such a huge development of business, there are some unreasonable business operations, as follows:

1.  Unreasonable capital structure, with large fixed capital and small circulating capital. According to statistics from grassroots cooperatives in eleven counties, fixed capital accounts for 22% and circulating capital accounts for 78%. At the same time, the valuation of fixed assets is too low. For example, the valuation of machinery in the rice mill of Liaoyang County Cooperative is 60% lower than the current estimate. This phenomenon also exists in the grassroots cooperatives in the Yanji area, making the true capital situation unclear.

2.  Slow capital turnover and unreasonable use. Although there are no comprehensive statistics, the materials from the supply and marketing department of Beizhen County Cooperative in western Liaoning Province and a district cooperative can illustrate this problem. The supply and marketing department of the county cooperative borrowed an average of 13.6524 million yuan per day for eight months, paying a total of 13.29 million yuan in interest. The average daily cash inventory was 4.7939 million yuan, accounting for 35.11% of the borrowed funds. The average cash inventory of Guoguobao District Cooperative in the first half of 1950 often accounted for 47% of the circulating capital. The capital turnover of the supply and marketing department averaged once every 40 days, while the district cooperative had a capital turnover of 2.7 times in half a year, requiring 55 days each time. It can be seen that "sleeping capital" greatly affects the capital turnover rate. Another factor affecting capital turnover is that cadres take the lead in defaulting and borrowing. Keshan County in Heilongjiang Province had a total of 1.5 billion yuan in arrears from village cooperatives throughout the county. The village chief of Sheli Village in Zhenlai owed 7.3 million yuan, and the branch secretary owed 1.9 million yuan. A total of 160 households in the village owed goods to the cooperative, resulting in arrears equivalent to 140% of the total capital. The cash borrowed by county-level agencies from the Liaoyang County Cooperative in eastern Liaoning Province was equivalent to two-thirds of the share capital paid by the lower-level cooperatives.

3.  Large expenses, and much loss and waste. In the first half of the year, the expenses of Guoguobao District Cooperative in Beizhen County accounted for 97.5% of the gross profit, and the expenses of Changxingdian Village Cooperative accounted for 95.67% of the gross profit. The above two cooperatives' expenses are only circulation fees and do not include taxes payable. The circulation fee of Guoguobao District Cooperative accounted for 85.7% of the gross profit and 13% of the total supply and marketing amount. In this case, it is impossible to talk about "cheap supply and reasonable sales." Waste phenomena: In the provincial cooperative's anti-corruption and anti-waste inspection organized by the Heilongjiang Provincial Cooperative in June and July this year, incomplete statistics from only eighteen counties reached over 10 billion yuan. According to incomplete statistics from Jilin, Songjiang, and Rehe provinces, and the three cities of Shenyang, Anshan, and Fushun from April to June, there were a total of 139 cases of corruption, waste, theft, fire, and loss, with losses of nearly 10 billion yuan. There are many tricks of corruption and waste. The Ciyutuozi District Cooperative in Liaozhong County, western Liaoning Province, often eats rice and white flour, and has a constant supply of fish and meat. The long-term wages of workers are not deducted when wages are paid, but reported as losses. A barrel of kerosene loses 150 jin in weight, and sea salt loses 4.8% in weight, with 5,000 jin lost for every 100,000 jin of salt.

In view of the above situation, in order to improve the operation and management of cooperatives, the following issues must be resolved:

First, the cooperative plan must be realistic.

The following three points are the most important: 1. The plan must be based on the supply and marketing needs of the members. Therefore, the formulation of the plan should first be from the bottom up, and then from the top down to combine. 2. To put forward the supply and marketing needs of members, two methods can be adopted at present. One is to obtain it through actual investigation from members, that is, based on the order forms submitted by members. For example, many grassroots cooperatives in Heilongjiang, all the seasonal items needed by members, such as sickles, knives, hoe blades, plowshares, and even straw hats, are purchased in advance according to the quantity reported by members. Another method is for the county cooperative to select one or several typical village cooperatives, investigate the purchasing power of the members and the specific varieties of production materials and living materials they need, and then calculate the estimated number of members needed according to the number of members. Special attention should be paid to the varieties and specifications of production materials. Although this method is not as realistic as the previous one, it is still relatively realistic as long as the typical selection is appropriate. 3. The above two methods must strive to gradually achieve the method of submitting order forms; but the method of coercion must not be adopted.

Second, implement the economic accounting system.

The main tasks of implementing the economic accounting system are three: 1. Reduce commodity circulation fees, that is, reduce commodity costs and reduce the cost of commodities in the entire circulation process; 2. Accelerate capital turnover; 3. Ensure a reasonable profit. As long as the commodity circulation fee is reduced and the capital turnover is accelerated, a certain reasonable profit will be guaranteed.

To this end, each operating unit of the cooperative should have its own relatively independent funds, and a single responsibility system should be adopted. Its capital composition, that is, the ratio of fixed capital to circulating capital, must be made as reasonable as possible, with the former being less and the latter being more. At the same time, it is also necessary to improve the accounting system and keep the accounts clear. Secondly, it is necessary to check the goods on a regular basis to clarify the actual inventory of goods and cash, otherwise it will be impossible to know how much capital there is, whether there are any cold goods, and how much loss and expense there is. Again, according to the materials provided above, carry out the necessary statistical accounting work by category. Finally, a quota management system must be implemented. However, the quota must be based on the existing work level and gradually increased (such as capital turnover) or reduced (such as expenditure standards or circulation fees).

Third, it is necessary to establish and improve the system and strengthen business guidance.

The systems that must be established and improved now are: accounting system, financial system, budget system, and inspection system. These systems must first be practical, simple, and easy to implement, and at the same time, they must be gradually revised, enriched, and improved in actual implementation.

In addition, it is also necessary to emphasize the business guidance of higher-level cooperatives to lower-level cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives. Today, most of the cooperative's business operations are done by farmers themselves, and most of them do not understand the cooperative's business. It is not enough to rely on planned education and training. It is necessary to strengthen the business guidance for them, and it must be carried out frequently and specifically in order to more effectively improve their business level. The serious shortcomings of neglecting business guidance work from top to bottom in the past must be resolutely corrected.

II. On the Issue of Closely Linking Cooperatives with Members

An important problem in the management of cooperatives is that the relationship between cooperatives and the masses of members is not close enough, and the work style of cooperative cadres is not democratic enough. In many cooperatives, the relationship between members and cooperatives is only an ordinary buying and selling relationship, and there is no other connection. Many cooperative directors said that if cooperative affairs are to be democratic, they would rather not do it, "What democracy do you need to do business!" Many cooperative directors always blame the masses for being "too backward" for many reflections raised by the masses of members, and there is no way to work. These situations all show that the reason why cooperative management is not democratic enough is first the ideological style of cooperative cadres, and secondly the issue of establishing and improving democratic systems. In order to correct these bad phenomena and strengthen the close relationship between cooperatives and members, we will discuss the following three issues.

First, to do a good job in the work of the masses of members, we must have a mass perspective and follow the mass line.

Cooperatives are both economic work and mass work. A cooperative worker must do a good job in mass work in order to do a good job in economic work. Therefore, first of all, it should be clearly recognized that cooperatives are undertakings run by the masses of members, and they must be organized by all members to be run well. The staff of the cooperative is the clerk of the members, so listen to the members and rely on the masses of members to come up with ideas. Only in this way can we unite all members and make members feel that the cooperative is really their own. Second, to unite members, we must always think of members, consider members, serve members, and put the interests of members first. What do members need to supply, how much do they need, and when do they need it? What do members need to sell, how much do they sell, and when do they sell it? In practical business activities, we must strive to solve these problems. In this way, we cannot "sell when they come" and "forget it if they don't come" to "stick to the stall," but we must deliver it to their door for the convenience of the members. In business activities, we must try to solve the immediate difficulties of the masses and widely absorb the opinions of the masses of members. In particular, the director of the cooperative should avoid putting on airs. He should take the time to personally visit the members' villages (the higher-level cooperatives should go to the lower-level cooperatives) to visit directors and supervisors, ask representatives, go to the members' homes, and find the basis for revising the business plan and improving the work. Third, it is necessary to confirm that the masses of members have methods, and to believe that the masses of members will manage and supervise the cooperatives well. Therefore, we must humbly learn from the masses of members. Fourth, we must carry out publicity and education work for the masses of members. On the one hand, we must explain the purpose and rules of the cooperative clearly. At the same time, the more important aspect is to closely combine with business activities, to publicize and educate the masses of members with good, lively, and practical examples in business activities; to make the masses of members understand how to manage and supervise the cooperative's business activities; the benefits of members submitting order forms, and the reasons why cooperatives need to make plans, etc., should be explained in conjunction with specific facts.

In short, cooperative workers must establish and strengthen the mass viewpoint of serving members, must have the ideological style of mass work that is good at following the mass line, and must combine business activities with mass work for members very flexibly. Only in this way can we fundamentally solve the problem of how to closely link cooperatives with members.

Second, improve and enrich the work of the grassroots cooperative's board of directors and board of supervisors.

Cooperative workers, to do a good job in the work of the masses of members, must also be combined with the backbone of the masses of members. The so-called backbone here mainly refers to the directors and supervisors of the grassroots cooperative. Therefore, improving and enriching the work of the grassroots cooperative's board of directors and board of supervisors is also an indispensable task for closely linking with members.

At present, the boards of directors and supervisors of grassroots cooperatives are mostly confused, with "one package" at meetings, and you and I do not distinguish between work. Therefore, they have not played their due role in organizational construction or business development.

The board of directors is the executive body of the cooperative, and it is independently responsible for economic accounting in business. It has two responsibilities: one is to protect all the property of the cooperative, and the other is to expand and increase the property of the cooperative. Based on these two principles, it operates its business by means of economic accounting, and constantly pays attention to absorbing new members and expanding share capital.

The basis for business operation is the resolution of the members' congress. After the members' congress, the board of directors formulates a retail and procurement plan according to the resolution, discusses it with the board of supervisors, and reports it to the higher-level cooperative. At the same time, it signs direct contracts with members, higher-level cooperatives or state-owned stores according to the plan to ensure the realization of the plan.

The board of supervisors is the supervisory body of the cooperative, and it represents all members to supervise and inspect the implementation of the resolutions of the members' congress by the board of directors, the plans and contracts made by the board of directors, and the instructions of the higher-level cooperative. Its daily work is also divided into two aspects. One aspect is the inspection and supervision of the cooperative's own business, finance, and cadre service; the other aspect is to check the members' love for the cooperative's property and their participation in business activities, and at the same time collect members' requirements and opinions to reflect to the board of directors as a basis for improving business. This is mass supervision.

In addition, the directors of the board of directors and the supervisors of the board of supervisors must also maintain close contact with the members' representatives or the group leaders of the members' groups. The directors and supervisors must promptly convey the resolutions of the board of directors and the board of supervisors, and the representatives or group leaders must temporarily convey the reflections of the masses of members.

Third, strengthen the meeting system, hold the members' congress well, and promote democracy.

The main content of the meeting system is that the directors, supervisors, members' representatives, and members' group leaders of the cooperative must be democratically elected by the masses of members to serve as trusted persons. The board of directors should regularly report work and publish accounts to the members. Special attention must be paid to the content of the report and the method of publishing the accounts. Efforts must be made to be popular and easy to understand so that the masses of members can really understand. The board of directors and the board of supervisors must hold meetings on time, and must maintain close contact with the members' group meetings. Do not only hold the board of directors meeting, but not the board of supervisors meeting, and also avoid both of them holding meetings without communicating with each other. No matter what kind of meeting is held, democracy must be fully promoted. It is necessary to avoid the phenomenon that those who attend the meeting do not dare to raise opinions, and only a few people have the final say. For example, some people say: "At the meeting, they are directors, and after the meeting, they are outsiders, and nothing happens when they go out." This is a concrete manifestation of formalism, and efforts must be made to improve it and enrich the content of the meeting.

Holding the members' congress well is also a necessary step to strengthen the democratic system.

After the expansion of the grassroots cooperative, the frequent convening of the general meeting of all members gradually becomes impossible. The members' congress will become the main organizational form and the highest authority of the cooperative's leading body after the meeting. All major issues of the cooperative must be discussed and resolved by the members' congress. The board of directors must formulate a specific plan based on the resolution, discuss it with the board of supervisors, and report it to the higher-level cooperative. Then, according to the plan, submit order forms and sign contracts with members, higher-level cooperatives, or state-owned stores to ensure the timely realization of the plan. The board of supervisors represents all members to supervise the implementation of the resolutions and plans of the congress by the board of directors, the contracts signed by the board of directors, and the instructions of the higher-level cooperative.

The number of members' representatives of the grassroots cooperative should be determined according to the number of members and the size of the members' villages included. Generally, one representative should be selected for every 50 to 100 members. The members' representatives must be elected, and must take into account the principle of "each village joining the cooperative, and each village sending people to manage" (this principle also applies to the election of directors and supervisors). The task of the members' representatives, in addition to representing the members in exercising the powers stipulated in the cooperative's articles of association at the members' congress, is mainly to become a link between the members and the cooperative during the adjournment of the members' congress. They should frequently collect and reflect the opinions of the masses of members so that the cooperative and the masses of members can often communicate and maintain close contact.

Regarding the issue of members' groups: The members' group is a grassroots organization of the cooperative. Through it, we can understand the supply and marketing requirements of the members, convey the resolutions of the board of directors and the board of supervisors, supervise and criticize members who violate and destroy the cooperative law and articles of association, reflect members' opinions, and introduce new members. They must be organized according to residential areas.

III. On the Issue of Cadre Education

In the first half of this year, cooperatives at all levels in Northeast China trained a total of 9,453 on-the-job cadres, accounting for more than 14% of the total number of 66,667 cooperative cadres in Northeast China. Adding the 11,294 trained in 1949, it accounts for more than 31% of the total number of cadres. Among them, 6,233 were accountants, accounting for 65.9% of the total number of trainees and 46.4% of the total number of on-the-job accountants (excluding the number of accountants trained in 1949). In addition, some areas have opened or are opening technical training classes for cotton, local products, and grain testing. The training classes held by cooperatives at all levels are mostly run by county cooperatives. For example, in Jilin Province, among the 2,817 cadres trained in half a year, those trained by the counties accounted for more than 77%. The training time is mostly about 15 days to one month, with a maximum of three months (Northeast Cooperative Headquarters) and a minimum of five or six days. In addition to the "Provisional Accounting Regulations for Cooperatives at All Levels in the Northeast Region" formulated by the Northeast Cooperative Headquarters, there are no other unified teaching materials, and various localities can choose them according to their needs. The teaching method is generally based on a combination of lectures and discussions, and a combination of theory and practice.

After general training, the policy level and business level of most cadres have improved. People who have received accounting training have generally established a preliminary accounting system, laying a favorable foundation for the implementation of a regular unified accounting system, and basically eliminating the phenomena of "long accounts," "combining old and new," "pocket accounts," and even no accounts. At the same time, it has begun to provide favorable conditions for statistical reporting work. A lot of valuable experience has also been gained in terms of educational content and training methods. For example, Songjiang achieved great results by adopting the method of on-site experiments and fake accounting when training accountants. Jilin once organized students to conduct accounting checks at the Jilin City Cooperative, discover problems, study and discuss them, and put forward improvement suggestions. Training business personnel by adopting typical reports on inspection work, combined with discussions and summaries, has also been welcomed by the students. This method is basically better than giving large classes.

However, the training work in the past six months still has the following shortcomings and problems:

First, some areas lack a practical approach in teaching content and methods, and still use the old methods. Some still stipulate that political courses account for more than 50% during the short training period. The general shortcomings are that the teaching content is too much and empty, and the shortcomings of separation of learning and application are also quite serious.

Second, the organizational structure of cadre education is unsound, and some leaders do not pay attention to or personally grasp the training work. For example, individual provincial cooperatives and many county cooperatives still do not have cadre sections or units. Some county cooperatives even give full authority of the training class to a section chief or accountant, and the director of the cooperative does not ask about the training class.

Third, most of the on-the-job cadres study very poorly. Although the federations at all levels generally stipulate the system, the effect is not great. And the most important cadres of the grassroots cooperatives, for the most part, do not study at all, or rarely study.

Regarding the future cadre education work, we should focus on training cadres and on-the-job cadre learning. In the fourth quarter of this year, the training work can appropriately and selectively run on-the-job cadre training classes. At the same time, in order to unify the accounting system, provincial and county cooperatives can also take the method of going to the countryside to try out small-scale mobile intensive training or holding small meetings. In the fourth quarter, grassroots cooperatives will be able to basically try out the accounting regulations uniformly formulated by the Northeast Cooperative Headquarters. Provincial and county cooperatives will train a group of new accounting personnel through the Party and government education and training agencies under possible conditions to supplement the lack of grassroots social accounting.

On-the-job cadre learning should be regarded as equally important as training work. It is required to combine the on-the-job cadre learning plans of the Party committees at all levels and the instructions of the winter study work, and the federations at all levels are responsible for leading, focusing on the grassroots cooperatives, and establishing a regular on-the-job cadre learning system. The learning content should distinguish the specific situations of cadres at all levels and stipulate that learning culture or business is the focus of each.

　　东北整顿合作社工作中的几个问题
    东北合作总社
    一、关于业务经营合理化问题
    一年来东北合作社业务获得巨大发展，一九五○年上半年，合作社的零售总额为一三八、八一○亿元（东北币，下同），超过一九四九年全年零售总额的一·七倍。合作社的农副产品推销总额，本年上半年为六一、七五九亿元，超过一九四九年全年农副产品推销总额的百分之四十八。但在这样业务的巨大发展中，却存在着下述业务经营不合理的现象：
    一、资金构成不合理，固定资金大，流动资金小。据十一个县的基层社统计，固定资金占百分之二二，流动资金百分之七八。同时固定资产估价过低，例如辽阳县社制米厂之机器估价，原估价低于目前估计百分之六十，延吉地区之基层社亦存在这种现象，使资金的真实情况混乱不清。
    二、资金周转慢，使用不合理。虽无全面统计，仅就辽西省北镇县社供销部与一个区社的材料也可以说明这一问题。县社供销部八个月平均每天借入一三六、五二四万元，八个月共付利息一三、二九○万元；现金库存平均每天四七、九三九万元，占借入款的百分之三五·一一。苽苽堡区社一九五○年上半年平均现金库存，经常占流动资金的百分之四七。供销部的资金周转平均四十天一次，区社则半年资金周转二·七次，一次需五五天。由此可见，“资金睡觉”大大影响着资金周转率。影响资金周转的另一因素，就是干部带头赊欠与借款。黑龙江克山县全县村社共赊出十五亿，镇赉舍力村社村长赊欠七三○万元，支部书记赊欠一九○万元，全村有一六○户向合作社赊货，结果赊账相当于总资金的百分之一四○，辽东辽阳县社县级机关借去的现款相当于下级社缴纳股金的三分之二。
    三、开支大，损耗浪费多。北镇县苽苽堡区社上半年开支占毛利的百分之九七·五，常兴店村社上半年开支占毛利百分之九五·六七。以上两社之开支仅是流转费并未包括应缴税金。苽苽堡区社的流转费占毛利的百分之八五·七，占供销总额的百分之一三，如此则根本无从谈起“廉价供、合理销”了。浪费现象，今年六、七月间黑龙江省社组织的全省合作社反贪污浪费检查中，仅十八个县的不完全统计即达百亿以上。另据吉林、松江、热河三省，沈阳、鞍山、抚顺三市四月至六月不完全统计，共发生贪污浪费被盗失火丢失等共计一百三十九次，损失近百亿。贪污浪费的花样很多，辽西辽中县茨榆坨子区联社，经常吃大米白面，鱼肉不断，长支工薪在发薪时也不扣，报作损耗，火油一桶掉秤一五○斤，海盐减量百分之四·八，十万斤盐就掉秤五千斤。
    针对上述情况，为着搞好合作社经营管理必须解决下面几个问题：
    第一、合作社计划必须切合实际。
    这里提出最重要的下面三点：１、计划必须根据社员的供销需要来做。因此，计划的制订应该首先是从下而上，然后再从上而下地来结合。２、要提出社员的供销需要，目前可以采用两种办法，一种是向社员实际调查得来，即以社员所提出的订货单为根据。例如黑龙江的许多基层社，凡是社员所需带有季节性的东西，镰刀、饍刀、锄板、犁铧乃至草帽等，都是预先根据社员所报数量采办的。另一种办法，即由县联社选择确当的一种或几种典型村社，调查社员的购买力和他所需的生产资料和生活资料的具体品种，然后根据社员人数，算出社员需要的估计数来，其中应该特别注意生产资料的品种规格。这种办法，其切合实际的程度，虽然不及前一种，但只要典型选得确当，还是比较切合实际的。３、上面的两种办法，必须争取逐渐做到提出订货单的办法；但决不能采取强迫命令的办法。
        第二、实行经济核算制。
    实行经济核算制的主要任务有三条：一、降低商品流转费，即降低商品成本，降低商品在整个流转过程中的费用；二、加速资金周转；三、保证合理的一定利润。只要降低了商品流转费，加速了资金周转，一定的合理的利润，也就有了保证。
    为此，合作社的每一经营单位，都应有其相当独立的资金，并应采取单一负责制。它的资金构成，即固定资金与流动资金的比重，必须尽量做到合理，前者要少后者要多。同时还必须健全会计制度，账目必须记载清楚。其次，必须按期点货，要把商品和现金的实际库存都搞清楚，否则就无从真实知道有多少资金，究竟有无冷货，损耗费究竟有多少。再次，根据前面所提供的材料，分门别类进行必要的统计核算的工作。最后必须实行定额管理。但定额必须以现有工作水平为基础，而逐步加以提高（如资金周转）或降低（如开支标准或流转费）。
    第三、必须建立与健全制度和加强业务指导
    现在必须建立与健全的制度是：会计制度、财务制度、预决算制度以及检查制度等。这些制度，首先要求能切合实际，简单易行，同时要在实际执行中，逐渐加以修正，充实和提高。
    此外，还必须强调上级社对下级社和基层社的业务指导。今天合作社的业务经营，大多是庄稼人自己做买卖，对于合作社业务大多数不懂，单靠有计划的进行教育训练工作是不够的，必须加强对他们的业务指导工作，而且必须经常进行具体指导，才能更有效地提高他们的业务水平。过去从上到下的忽视业务指导工作的严重缺点，必须坚决地加以纠正。
    二、关于密切合作社与社员关系的问题
    合作社管理中存在着的一个重要问题，就是合作社与社员群众的关系不够密切，合作社干部作风的不够民主的问题。在不少的合作社中，社员与合作社的关系，只有普通买卖关系，再无别的联系，有不少合作社的主任，听说合作社办事要讲民主，他就表示宁可不干，“做买卖还要讲啥民主！”有不少合作社主任，对于社员群众所提出的很多反映，总是怪群众“太落后”，工作没有办法。这些情况都说明，合作社管理之所以不够民主，首先是合作社干部的思想作风问题，其次才是建立与健全民主制度问题。为了改正这些不良现象与加强合作社与社员的密切关系，我们分下面三个问题来谈。
    第一、做好社员群众工作，要有群众观点，要走群众路线。
    合作社是经济工作又是群众工作。一个合作社的工作者，必须做好群众工作，才能做好经济工作。因此，首先应该明确认识合作社是社员群众办的事业，必须组织社员大家来办才能办好。合作社的工作人员，就是社员的办事员，就要倾听社员的话，就要依靠社员群众出主意。只有这样，才能团结全体社员，才能使社员感觉到合作社真是大伙儿自己的。第二、要团结社员就必须处处想到社员，为社员打算，为社员服务，把社员的利益放在第一位。社员需要供什么，要多少，什么时候要？社员需要销什么，销多少，什么时候销？在实际业务活动中要努力解决这些问题。如此，就不能“来了就卖”、“不来就算”去“死守摊子”，就要为社员方便，送上门去。在业务活动中，要尽量解决群众的切身困难，要广泛吸收社员群众的意见。尤其是社主任，切忌摆架子，他要抽出时间来亲自去到社员村（上级社就到下级社）访理事监事，问代表，到社员家里去，找到修正业务计划与改进工作的根据。第三，要确认社员群众有办法，要相信社员群众是会把合作社管理和监督得好的。因此要虚心向社员群众学习。第四，要向社员群众做宣传教育工作。一方面固然要把合作社的目的和规章办法等讲清楚。同时更重要的一面，却是要密切地结合业务活动，要把业务活动中好的生动活泼的实际例子，向社员群众宣传和教育；要使社员群众懂得，对合作社业务活动，应该怎样去进行管理监督；对于社员提出订货单的好处，以及合作社需要做计划的道理等，要配合具体事实，进行解释。
    总之，合作社工作者必须确立和加强为社员服务的群众观点，必须具备善于走群众路线的群众工作的思想作风，必须很灵活地把业务活动与对社员所进行的群众工作结合起来。只有这样，我们才能从基本上去解决如何密切合作社与社员关系的问题。
    第二、健全与充实基层社理事会与监事会的工作。
    合作社工作者，要做好社员群众工作，还须与社员群众的骨干相结合。这里所谓骨干，主要就是基层社的理事和监事。因此，健全与充实基层社理事会和监事会的工作，也是密切与社员关系所不可缺少的工作。
    现在，基层社的理、监事会，大都混淆不清，开会时“一揽子”，工作你我不分。因此，不论在组织建设上或业务开展上，都没有起应有的作用。
    理事会是合作社的执行机关，在业务上，它对经济核算独立负责。它的责任有两个：一个是保护合作社的全部财产，一个是扩大与增加合作社的财产。根据这两个原则，用经济核算的方法经营其业务，并经常注意吸收新社员与扩大股金。
    业务经营的依据就是社员代表大会的决议，社员代表大会之后，理事会就按着决议制定零售与采购计划，商得监事会同意后，报告上级社，同时根据计划分别向社员、上级社或国营商店签订直接合同，保证计划之实现。
    监事会是合作社的监察机关，是代表全体社员监督和检查理事会对社员代表会议决议，理事会订的计划、合同以及上级社指示的执行的。它的日常工作也分两方面，一方面是对合作社本身业务、财务、干部服务状况的检查监督；一方面是检查社员对合作社财产的爱护与业务活动的参加情况，同时搜集社员对合作社的要求与意见，反映给理事会，做为改进业务的依据，这就是群众监督。
    此外，理事会的理事与监事会的监事，还须与社员代表或社员小组的小组长，取得密切联系，理监事要及时传达理监事会决议，代表或组长要临时传达社员群众的反映。
    第三、加强会议制度，开好社员代表会，发扬民主。
    会议制度的主要内容，是合作社的理事、监事、社员代表和社员小组长，均须由社员群众民主选出自己信任的人来担任。理事会要定期向社员报告工作和公布账目。报告内容和公布账目的方法，必须特别注意，要力求通俗浅显，使社员群众真能听懂。理事会、监事会均须按时开会，并须与社员小组会取得密切联系，不要只开理事会，不开监事会，也要避免两者都开而互不通气。无论开什么会，都须充分发扬民主，必须避免到会者有意见也不敢提，总是少数人说了就算的现象，例如有人这样说：“开会是理事，散会是外事，出门啥也不是”。这是形式主义的具体反映，必须努力改进，充实会议内容。
    开好社员代表会，也是加强民主制度的必要步骤。
    基层社扩大后，全体社员大会的经常召开，逐渐成为不可能，社员代表大会将变为会后合作社领导机关的主要组织形式与最高权力机关。合作社所有重大问题必须经过社员代表会的讨论与决议。理事会必须根据决议，制定具体计划，商得监事会同意后报告上级社。随之按照计划分别同社员、上级社或国营商店提出订货单，签订合同，保证计划的按期实现。监事会代表全体社员监督理事会对大会的决议、计划与理事会已签订的合同以及对上级社的指示执行。
    基层社社员代表的名额，应根据社员之多寡与其所包括社员村之大小而定，一般以五十至一百社员选一代表为宜。社员代表必须选举，并必须照顾到“各村入社，各村派人来管理”的原则（这一原则同样适用于理监事的选举）。社员代表的任务，除在社员代表会上代表社员执行社章上规定的职权之外，主要是在社员代表会闭幕期间，成为社员与合作社之间联系的纽带，应该经常地搜集与反映社员群众的意见，使合作社与社员群众经常通气，密切联系。
    关于社员小组问题：社员小组是合作社基层组织，通过它来了解社员供销要求，传达理、监事会决议，对违反破坏合作社法及章程的社员进行监督与批评，反映社员意见，介绍新社员，必须按居住区域组织起来。
    三、关于干部教育问题
    东北各级合作社于今年上半年中，共训练在职干部九千四百五十三名，占全东北合作社干部总数六万六千六百六十七名的百分之十四强，加上一九四九年度训练的一万一千二百九十四名，则共占干部总数的百分之三十一强。其中会计六、二三三名，占受训总数的百分之六五·九，占在职会计总数百分之四六·四（不包括一九四九年受训的会计人数）。此外尚有部分地区，已开办过或正在开办棉花、土产、粮食化验等技术训练班。各级社举办的训练班，以县社办的较多。如吉林省半年训练二、八一七名干部中，各县训练的占百分之七七强。训练时间大多为十五天到一月左右，最多的三个月（东北总社），少的五、六天。教学内容，除东北总社拟定的《东北区各级合作社暂行会计规程》之外，没有其他统一的教材，各地可按需要自行选用。教学方法一般是以讲授与讨论相结合，理论与实际相结合的方法为主。
    经过一般训练的干部，政策水平和业务水平大多提高了一步。经过会计训练的人员，普遍地建立了初步的会计制度，打下了实行正规的统一会计制度的有利基础，基本上消灭了“长条账”，“新旧合一”，“口袋账”，甚至没有账的现象。同时，并为统计表报工作，开始提供了有利条件。在教育内容和训练方法方面也获得了不少宝贵的经验，如松江训练会计时，采用实地试验和假作账的方式，收效很大。吉林曾组织学员到吉市合作社进行查账，发现问题，研究讨论，并提出改进意见。训练业务人员，则采取作检查工作的典型报告，并结合讨论和总结的办法也获得学员的欢迎。这种办法基本上胜于上大课。
    但半年来的训练工作还存在着以下缺点和问题：
    首先，部分地区在教学内容和方法上，缺乏从实际出发而还是老一套的办法。有的在短短训练期间，还规定政治课占百分之五十以上，一般的缺点是，教学内容多而空，学与用脱节的缺点也相当严重。
    第二、干部教育工作的组织机构不健全，有的领导者对训练工作不重视、不亲自掌握。例如个别省社及不少县社，至今还没有干部科或股，有的县社竟把训练班的全权交给一个股长或会计，社主任对训练班却不闻不问。
    第三、在职干部学习大多很差。各级联社虽一般地规定了制度，但效果不大。而最重要的基层社干部，却绝大部分根本不学，或很少学习。
    关于今后干部教育工作，应着重从训练干部和在职干部学习两方面来进行。训练工作，今年第四季度可以适当酌办在职干部训练班，同时，为了统一会计制度，省、县社还可采取下乡试办小型巡回集训或开小会的办法，在第四季内，基层社将能基本上试行东北总社统一制定的会计规程。省、县社在可能条件下通过党、政府教育训练机关培养一批新的会计人员，以补基层社会计之不足。
    在职干部学习应视为与训练工作同等重要，要求结合各级党委在职干部学习计划及冬学工作指示，由各级联社负责领导，以基层社为重点，建立经常性的在职干部学习制度。学习内容，应区分各级社干部的具体情形，规定学习文化或业务为各自的重点。
