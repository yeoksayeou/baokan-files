　　Beijing Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland, Defend the Nation Art Exhibition
　　Ye Qianyu
　　During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, a large number of cartoons, posters, and propaganda paintings appeared in newspapers, magazines, on walls, and in shop windows. Art workers, with the greatest enthusiasm, reflected this intensely passionate movement theme in their works. Art-loving masses also surged into this tide of struggle, forming a magnificent force of the art world to Resist America, Aid Korea. This Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland, Defend the Nation Art Exhibition jointly organized by various art groups in Beijing is the first review of this force.
　　This exhibition was initiated by the National Artists Association. Various art schools and groups in Beijing, such as the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Art and Labor Department of the Normal University, the Stage Art Department of the Central Academy of Drama, Jinghua Art School, Youth Art Theatre, People's Art Studio, Fine Arts Publishing House, the Art Department of the Amateur Art School, the Labor and Art Learning Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers, the New Chinese Painting Research Association, as well as the Tianjin Artists Association, Shijiazhuang Artists Association, and other units, participated with their works. There were also works by primary school students, middle school students, workers, and people from other social strata. The total number of exhibits was 838, and due to the limitations of the venue, there were more than 1,000 works that could not be exhibited.
　　In such an exhibition, the works of experts and the masses are displayed together, learning from each other and influencing each other. Just from the perspective of mutual observation within the art world, its effect is significant.
　　What do the visiting masses think of this exhibition?
　　A people's police officer said: "The crimes of American imperialism and our hatred are vividly depicted to good effect."
　　A clothing factory worker said: "This kind of exhibition best suits the needs of us workers, and we hope it will be held more often."
　　Some also hope to move it to various towns and villages.
　　These opinions indicate that the works have played a certain role, and the masses also attach great importance to and care about our work. For example, many people were deeply moved by the vivid images and national style of the Northeast peasants in Jiang Zhaohe's work "On the Banks of the Yalu River," considering it an outstanding work. Some also pointed out that the collective creation of the New Chinese Painting Research Association, "Exposing the US Imperialists' Conspiracy to Steal the Name of the United Nations for Aggression," clearly exposed the conspiracy of the US imperialists and showed the greatness of the people's power. Many people expressed satisfaction with the collective creation of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, "History of US Imperialist Aggression Against China." The vast majority of people felt that the creative enthusiasm of the teachers and primary and secondary school students of the Labor and Art Learning Association was inspiring, and expressed admiration for the workers' close connection with practical works and their wisdom.
　　At the same time, the shortcomings of the works in the exhibition were also pointed out:
　　"There are too few paintings depicting the victory of the Volunteer Army and the panic and chaos of the US imperialist rout."
　　"There is too little depiction of women's anti-US actions."
　　"Some cartoons are difficult to understand and require guessing, which is not good."
　　"Posters only pay attention to the image, and the courage and anger of the Volunteer Army are not sufficiently expressed."
　　"Some of the movements using weapons in the pictures are incorrect." Dissatisfaction was expressed with some roughly presented works.
　　Summarizing the above opinions, the main shortcomings of this work are:
　　First, the scope of themes reflected is too narrow.
　　Second, the expression is not real and deep enough.
　　Third, the form is too generalized.
　　Although these shortcomings are also reflected in the works of the masses, I believe that the works of experts should be required first, because the audience will not have overly high requirements for non-expert works. Moreover, the mass works this time showed a wider range of themes and more diverse forms of expression.
　　For example, a worker in Tianjin described "One spindle, one gun, one spinning machine, one cannon," reflecting the production enthusiasm of textile workers. And it illustrates the significance of production for supporting the war. Many other patriotic actions of the Chinese people in resisting America and aiding Korea should be the most moving themes, such as: "Seeing off classmates to participate in military cadre schools," "Sewing comfort bags," "Transporting comfort goods to the Volunteer Army," "Producing more grain to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." These are reflected in the works of primary and secondary school students.
　　Regarding the diversification of forms of expression, students from the school for the deaf and mute created dozens of woodcuts, while experts only created one woodcut; there were three works on the theme of General Kim Il-sung, two of which were also created by the masses, one was a statue of Kim Il-sung by the Labor and Art Learning Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers in Beijing, and the other was a series of comic strips on the revolutionary history of Kim Il-sung created by a middle school girl, which attracted much attention.
　　The masses can grasp these vivid and broad themes and express them in various art forms, which is a feature of this exhibition.
　　In the upsurge of resisting America and aiding Korea, many cartoons and posters have appeared, and some good works have indeed played a significant role among the masses. There is no doubt that cartoons and posters are the most combative forms of painting. Many art workers temporarily put down the forms of expression they were accustomed to and picked up this new combat weapon. Therefore, cartoons and posters became the main form of expression for art work during this period.
　　For directly and effectively striking the enemy, cartoons are indeed a good weapon, and for publicizing the protection of the homeland and defending the nation, posters do have their motivating power. Art workers adopted this weapon in order to exert greater and faster work effects, so many traditional Chinese painters and Western painters also used this weapon, which is a passionate expression of patriotism. However, we cannot think that we have fulfilled our responsibilities by doing this or only by doing this. If we understand the profound and positive significance of resisting America and aiding Korea, and understand that this is the main political struggle of the Chinese people and the people of the world against imperialism at this stage and in the future, then the "scope" we need to strive for is very large, and we should link this struggle with our own production work like industrial workers, and exert a wider and stronger force. Of course, we cannot one-sidedly regard cartoons and posters as the only forms in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. We should use all our art forms, some can sing the praises of the people's power, and some can directly satirize the enemy, cooperating with each other, then the power will be greater. Therefore, all art workers should seize this struggle theme well and fight with different weapons.
　　This exhibition demonstrated the high patriotic enthusiasm of Beijing art workers, and also demonstrated a close spirit of unity. Through such a specific work, every author was educated, and the masses were also educated. Many of our professional painters should adopt various different methods to help and guide the creative work of the masses, so that they can gradually improve, and we should also learn and absorb the vivid and fresh expressions in their creations from the large number of mass creations to enrich our own works.

### 北京抗美援朝保家卫国美术展览会

　　北京抗美援朝保家卫国美术展览会
    叶浅予
    在抗美援朝运动中，报上、杂志上、墙壁上、橱窗里，出现了大批漫画、招贴画、宣传画。美术工作者以最大的热情，把这一个热火朝天的运动主题，反映在他们的作品里，爱好美术的群众也拥进这个斗争的热潮，组成了美术界抗美援朝的壮阔队伍，这次北京市各美术团体联合举办的抗美援朝保家卫国美术展览会，就是这支队伍第一次的检阅。
    这个展览会由全国美协发起，北京市各美术学校团体如中央美术学院，师大美劳系，中央戏剧学院舞台美术系，京华美专，青年艺术剧院，人民美术工作室，美术出版社，业余艺术学校美术系，中小学教师劳美学习会，新中国画研究会以及天津美协，石家庄美协等单位都参加了作品，还有小学生、中学生、工人、和其他阶层群众的作品。展出作品总数八三八件，因为会场地位的限制，没有展出的作品还有一千多件。
    这样的展览会，专家和群众的作品陈列在一块，彼此互相学习，互相影响，单就美术界内部互相观摩的意义讲，它的作用也是很大的。
    参观群众对这个展览会怎样看法呢？
    一个人民警察说：“美帝罪行和我们的仇恨都能生动的描写到好处了。”
    一个被服厂工人说：“这样的展览会最适合我们工人的要求，希望多多举行。”
    还有人希望移到各地城镇农村去举行。
    这些意见，说明作品是起了一定的作用的，群众也非常重视和关切我们的工作。譬如，很多人对蒋兆和的作品《鸭绿江畔》中生动的东北农民形象和作风的民族气派深受感动，认为是一件出色的作品，也有人提出新中国画研究会的集体创作，“揭穿美帝盗用联合国名义的侵略阴谋”明确的揭穿了美帝阴谋和显示了人民力量的伟大。很多人对中央美术学院的集体创作《美帝侵华史》表示满意。绝大多数人觉得劳美学习会老师们和中小学同学们的创作热情是令人感动的，对工人们密切联系实际的作品以及他们的智慧表示钦佩。
    同时也指出展览会中作品的缺点：
    “描写志愿军的胜利和美帝溃败的惊慌混乱的画太少。”
    “描写妇女抗美行动的太少。”
    “有些漫画不好懂，要猜来猜去不好。”
    “招贴画只注意形象，而对志愿军勇敢愤怒的气魄表现不够。”
    “有些画面中使用武器的动作不正确。”对于有些表现得粗糙的作品表示不满。
    归纳上面的意见，这次作品的主要缺点是：
    第一、题材反映的面太小。
    第二、表现得不够真实和深入。
    第三、形式一般化。
    这些缺点，虽然也表现在群众的作品上，但是我认为应该首先要求专家作品，因为观众对非专家的作品不会有过高的要求。而且，这次群众作品中在表现题材上，显得广泛，表现形式也比较多样化。
    譬如一位天津工人描写了“一根锭子一杆枪，一台纺机一尊炮”，反映了纺织工人的生产热情。而且说明了生产对于支援战争的意义。其他许许多多中国人民在抗美援朝中的爱国行动，应该是最动人的题材。如：“欢送同学参加军事干部学校”，“缝慰劳袋”，“运慰劳品给志愿军”，“多打粮食支援中国人民志愿军”。在中小学生的作品里反映出来了。
    关于表现形式的多样化，聋哑学校学生制作了数十幅木刻，而专家的木刻只有一件；金日成将军的题材有三件作品，其中两件也是群众的作品，一是北京市中小学教员劳美学习会的金日成塑像，另一是很引人注意的一位中学女生创作的金日成革命史连环画。
    群众能掌握这些生动广泛的题材用各种美术形式来表现，是这次展览会中的一个特点。
    在抗美援朝热潮中，曾经出现了很多漫画和招贴画，有些好作品的确在群众中起了很大的作用。毫无疑问，漫画和招贴画是绘画形式中最富于战斗性的一种形式，很多美术工作者暂时放下他们运用惯了的表现形式，拿起了这种新的战斗武器，因此漫画和招贴画在这一时期中成了美术工作的主要表现形式。
    为了直接有效地打击敌人，漫画的确是好武器，为了宣传保家卫国，招贴画的确有它的鼓动力量。美术工作者为了要发挥更大更快的工作效果，采取了这种武器，因此许多国画家、西洋画家们也都运用了这种武器，这是爱国热情热烈的表现。但是，我们的工作不能认为这样做了或者只有这样做才算尽了我们的责任。如果我们认识了抗美援朝的深长积极的意义，认识了这是中国人民以及世界人民在现阶段和今后对帝国主义的主要政治斗争，那么，我们所要努力的“面”就很大，我们应该像产业工人一样把这一斗争和自己的生产工作联系起来，发挥更广泛更强大的力量。我们当然不能片面地把漫画和招贴画，作为抗美援朝斗争中唯一形式。而应该运用我们所有的美术形式，有的可以歌颂人民的力量，有的可以直接讽刺敌人，互相配合，那么力量就将发挥更大。因此所有的美术工作者，应当很好的抓住这个斗争主题，用不同的武器作战。
    这次展览会，表现了北京美术工作者高度的爱国热情，也表现了紧密的团结精神。通过这样一次具体的工作，教育了每一个作者，也教育了群众。我们的许多专业画家们，应当采用各种不同的方式，去帮助和指导群众创作，使他们日渐提高，而我们也应当从大量的群众创作中，学习和吸取他们创作中的生动的，新鲜的各种表现手法。来丰富我们自己的作品。
