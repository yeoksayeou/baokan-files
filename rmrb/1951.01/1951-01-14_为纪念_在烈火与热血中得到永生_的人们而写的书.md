　　A Book Commemorating Those "Who Attained Immortality in Flames and Blood"

　　"Shangrao Concentration Camp"
　　(Augmented Edition, Xinhua Bookstore Edition)

　　It has been exactly ten years since the Wan Nan Incident, created by the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on January 13, 1941. In those years, the Chiang bandit gang established countless concentration camps in the areas under its control, imprisoning hundreds of thousands of revolutionary patriots. The Shangrao Concentration Camp was one of the largest, imprisoning thousands of people, mostly New Fourth Army cadres and soldiers captured by the Chiang bandit gang through shameless conspiracies during the Wan Nan Incident, and the rest were patriotic people from southeastern provinces. "Shangrao Concentration Camp" is a book that exposes the life and struggle within the concentration camp. All the articles in the book (except for "The Concentration Camp in Shangrao") were written by comrades who escaped from the concentration camp, and each article is filled with blood and hatred.

　　This concentration camp was divided into several parts, including Qifengyan, Zhougang Village, and Maojialing: some were forced labor camps, some were political re-education centers, and some were living hells. The punishments used in the concentration camp were extremely cruel: there were "metal (needles piercing the abdomen), wood (torture), water (pouring pepper water), fire (burning, scalding), earth (live burial), wind (stripped naked and hung on a tree on winter nights), hunger (not given enough to eat), disease (no medicine, no medical treatment), fatigue (forced to work without rest all day)" and other tortures. Maojialing also had an "iron cage." This "cage" was surrounded by barbed iron needles. When a person was hung inside, they would faint in less than half an hour. Many loyal comrades died tragically under these kinds of torture devices. The reactionaries thought that these cruel methods could make the revolutionary patriots submit and extinguish the flames of revolution; but on the contrary, our revolutionary fighters, although suffering from the torment of flames, became more and more hardened.

　　The captured comrades still quickly established Party branches in the concentration camp and lived organized lives as usual. Under the leadership of the Party, organized uprisings took place one after another.

　　On the night of May 25, 1942, an uprising began in Maojialing. Under the slogan "In the first second, whoever has the weapon wins" put forward by the uprising committee, the patriots seized weapons and rushed out of the concentration camp.

　　Another uprising occurred when the Japanese invaders attacked and the reactionaries prepared to flee, moving the concentration camp to Fujian. On the way of the transfer, on the night of June 17, 1942, in Chishi, Chong'an, northern Fujian, the heroic "Sixth Team" successfully broke out of the cage and reached the free world of Wuyi Mountain, resuming their revolutionary struggle.

　　From the above two uprisings, we can see the unyielding perseverance and will of the revolutionary patriots, the correctness of the Party's leadership, and the thoroughness of the uprising plan.

　　This book records the inhuman persecution suffered by Comrade Shi Qi, a great female Communist Party member. Her experience and her strong Party spirit are extremely moving. She resolutely refused to surrender or confess, and was not afraid of various tortures and the coming of death. When she talked with her comrades, she was still very optimistic. She knew that although she was captured, the New Fourth Army and the vast people were still advancing towards development and victory. She repeatedly expressed that this suffering was for "the benefit of the majority of people and the cause of human liberation." This is a typical revolutionary optimist.

　　In order to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Wan Nan Incident, to commemorate the martyrs of whom Comrade Ye Ting spoke, "who attained immortality in flames and blood," and to learn from their heroic spirit of arduous struggle, we should read this record of blood. (Li Kejun)

　　Editor's Note: There is also a "Shangrao Concentration Camp" picture album (painted by Shao Yu, Xinhua Bookstore Edition) that can be read in conjunction with the book introduced above. The East China Xinhua Bookstore also has a good book "Before and After the Wan Nan Incident" (written by Chen Congyi), which also chronicles the historical facts before and after the Wan Nan Incident.

　　"Record of Blood" - Letters of Shot French Communists
　　(Compiled and translated by Luo Fen, New Group Publishing House, July 1950 edition)

　　During the years of war and occupation, 75,000 members of the French Communist Party sacrificed their lives for the independence and freedom of their motherland. At the Valérien Mountain execution ground and in the Lille fortress, heroes, in handcuffs and shackles, wrote their wills to their party, comrades, parents, wives, and children. They firmly believed that their beautiful motherland would be liberated and that the cause of communism would surely triumph. They regarded participating in this struggle and sacrificing for it as the greatest honor. They told their comrades to be brave, careful, and to inherit their legacy, and to severely punish the traitorous enemies. Then, with their heads held high, they sang the Internationale and proudly died for the people.

　　From these letters, we see that these martyrs made of special material were so firm because they had a great ideal. Until the last minute, they felt proud because they had chosen a correct path, a path that led their motherland and the people of the world to happiness. On this road, they worked uprightly for their motherland, for working mankind, and for the future of their children. They were all full of confidence, as Ai Er Shangbiyong said in his letter: "Through the bloody struggle, the dawn is emerging in the East and the West, the South and the North."

　　When alive, the Communists devoted themselves to their work. And when the motherland and the cause of communism needed them to sacrifice, they regarded death as going home. The enemy sentenced them to death, which was what they expected. They didn't even bat an eye, and even greeted the verdict with a slight smile of contempt. Young Andre Julan said in his letter: "I will die as bravely as in battle. I am a revolutionary soldier. My heart will live with the Party. We will sing our songs loudly and die for our Party." They were worthy of their motherland and the people.

　　Yes, only Communists truly understand the meaning of life. They never waste a moment. They love life and freedom, and yearn for a bright future. Therefore, they cannot help but feel regret when they are about to die. Moliès Kalazhete said: "Alas, how wonderful it would be to live to see the bright days and see everything with my own eyes! But, what is comforting is that we will not be forgotten, because we participated in the creation of this beautiful future." Robert Ameri also said: "I want to live: to avenge our executioners. But it doesn't matter, others will avenge us." They understood that they were sacrificing for the happiness of mankind. Joan Robert said: "Many of our comrades have sacrificed, and many more will sacrifice, but the day of reward is approaching, ..., we believe that tens of thousands of patriots will rise up to replace us who have been executed by the enemy, to continue the struggle that will bring freedom and happiness to the people of the world." Their hope for their living comrades is: "May you be more brave!" This is their slogan. When Moliès Kalazhete learned that his wife had taken over his work, he felt happy and proud. He said: "But you must be careful..."

　　When we read "Record of Blood," we seem to hear the strong voices of the soldiers. Let us listen to what Andre Dairmon wrote a few minutes before he was hanged. He wrote: "All my thoughts at this moment yearn for our dear Party, for the heroic liberation struggles of the people of all countries, for our dear Stalin, for the struggle for which we are about to give our lives today. We look into the eyes of the executioners and calmly give our lives. We are proud that we are dying for our suffering motherland, and at the same time know that tomorrow our motherland will be resurrected."

　　The book "Record of Blood" strongly tells us: In any country, there is only one truth: Communism is irresistible! Everyone who cares about the communist struggles in all countries of the world should take a look at this record and prophecy written in blood. (Yan Xiang)

　　"Report from the Gallows"
　　(Written by Julius Fučík, translated by Liu Liaoyi, Dalian Guanghua Bookstore Edition)

　　This work recently won the special honorary prize of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The author is the famous Czech writer and martyr - Comrade Julius Fučík. During the period of Hitler's fascism, the author selflessly carried out arduous and complex underground struggles for the Party and the people; unfortunately, he was arrested in April 1942. Fučík, who was unyielding after unimaginable torture and threats and inducements, was murdered in Berlin in September 1943. "Report from the Gallows" was written by the author with the help of A. Klingsky (a prison guard), an outstanding underground worker, who supplied paper and pencils.

　　"Report from the Gallows" records his life, people, and thoughts in prison, and is a model of the high combination of politics and artistry. It should be pointed out that the outstanding fighting style is the most prominent feature of this work; the irreconcilable and sharp satire of the enemy and the infinite confidence in his own cause run through every word of the book.

　　In the author's own words, it can be explained what power drove the author to write this immortal work in such a terrible fascist prison:

　　"...Do not forget! Do not forget the good and the bad. Patiently collect the evidence of those who sacrificed for themselves and for you. The present will become the past, and the day will surely come when people talk about the great era and the nameless heroes who created history. ...Let those who sacrificed in battle make you feel as close as friends, as your motherland, as yourselves!"

　　When the fascist beasts inflicted appalling torture on Fučík, he uttered such a voice from the bottom of his heart:

　　"But I still can't die. Mom, Mom, why was I born so strong?" This is the humanistic cry of the fearless communist. "I love life and fight for its beauty. ...I was born for joy, and I die for joy. It is unjust to place a sad angel on my grave!" This is a hymn to life and a cheer for the revolutionary cause!

　　At the same time, the author also sang praises for the images of the heroes he witnessed. Among them, some were wearing enemy uniforms, taking extraordinary risks, "in order not to let the connection between today in chains and the free tomorrow be interrupted." Some worked modestly and unnoticed in peacetime, and when they were unfortunately arrested, they kept their mouths shut in the face of torture; when they were about to die, they said simply: "Don't pity me, ...I have done everything that the worker's duty required of me, and I have not betrayed this duty to die." Some said to the special agents and executioners after saying goodbye to their comrades before going to the execution ground: "There is nothing you can do. Many of our people have sacrificed, but in the end it is still you who will be crushed." In short, they are all real people; they are not considering themselves, but the collective; they are living for today's battle and tomorrow's joy; they are the thousands of heroes of communism - immortal people.

　　The author's "Prison Diary" could not be continued after September 8, 1942. The fascist bandits took away his life full of passion and courage. The author finally warned us:

　　"People, I love you! You must be vigilant!"

　　As long as the imperialists still exist, all the special agents and bandits will not be willing to die. Fučík teaches us to recognize the enemy, hate the enemy, and at the same time be more vigilant against the enemy. This is also something we cannot lightly let go. (Zhao Lükuan)

　　Editor's Note: This book has been republished by Sanlian Bookstore and renamed "On the Gallows."

　　为纪念“在烈火与热血中得到永生”的人们而写的书
    “上饶集中营”
    （增补本  新华书店版）
    一九四一年一月十三日国民党蒋匪帮制造的皖南事变，到现在已经整整十年了。当年蒋匪帮在统治地区内设立了无数集中营，囚禁数十万革命志士。上饶集中营是其中最大的一个，被囚数千人，最大部分是皖南事变时被蒋匪帮用无耻阴谋俘去的新四军干部与战士，其余是东南各省的爱国志士。“上饶集中营”是暴露集中营内生活与斗争的一本书，书中所有文章（“上饶的集中营”一篇除外）都是集中营中逃出来的同志们写的，每篇文章都充满了血与恨。
    这个集中营分为七峰岩，周冈村和茅家岭等几个部分：有的是苦工营，有的是政治软化所，有的是活地狱。集中营里施用的刑罚是残酷到极点的：有“金（针刺腹部）、木（拷打）、水（灌辣水）、火（烧、烫）、土（活埋）、风（冬夜赤身挂在树上）、饿（不给吃饱）、病（不给药、不准医）、疲（使终日无休息）等刑罚。”茅家岭还设了“铁笼”，这个“笼”四周是满布着有刺的铁针，当把人吊在里边的时候，不要半个钟头，人就要晕过去。有不少的忠贞同志，都惨死在这类刑具下边。反动派满以为用这些残酷的办法，可以使革命志士屈服，可以消灭革命的火焰；但相反的，我们的革命战士们，虽然受着烈火的熬煎，却愈锻炼愈坚硬。
    被俘的同志们，在集中营里仍然很快的建立了党支部，照样的过着组织生活。在党的领导下，有组织的暴动便接连地发生了。
    一九四二年五月二十五日的晚上，在茅家岭开始了暴动。在暴动委员会提出的“第一秒钟，武器在谁手里，谁就胜利”的口号下，志士们便夺得了武器，冲出了集中营。
    又一次的暴动是在日寇进攻、反动派准备逃跑、将集中营迁到福建去的时候。就在迁移途中，一九四二年六月十七日的晚上，在闽北崇安赤石，英勇的“六队”胜利地冲出了牢笼，到达了武夷山上的自由天地，重过着革命斗争的生活。
    从以上两次暴动中，可以看出革命志士不屈服的毅力和意志，党的领导的正确和暴动计划的周密。
    本书记述了一个伟大的女共产党员施奇同志受非人迫害的情形，她的遭遇和她那种坚强的党性，是极端令人感动的。她坚决地拒绝了投降与自首，丝毫也不怕各种刑罚和死的来袭。她和同志谈话，还是乐观得很。她知道她个人虽然被俘，但新四军和广大的人民仍然在朝着发展和胜利之途迈进。她不止一次地表示这受难是为了“多数人们的利益和人类解放事业”。这正是革命乐观主义者的典型。
    为着纪念皖南事变的十周年，为着纪念叶挺同志所说的“在烈火与热血中得到永生”的先烈，并向他们学习艰苦斗争的英雄气概，我们应该读一读这一本血的纪录。          （李克俊）
    编者按：另有一本“上饶集中营”画册（邵宇绘、新华书店版）可以和上面介绍的一本书联系起来阅读。华东新华书店还有一本“皖南事变前后”（陈从一著）也是纪述皖南事变前后史实的一本好书。
            “血的记录”——被枪杀的法国共产党人的书简
    （罗焚辑译  新群出版社一九五○年七月版）
    法国共产党在战争和沦陷的岁月，有七万五千名党员为祖国的独立自由牺牲了生命。在瓦莱里安山的刑场，在里尔要塞，英雄们带着手铐脚镣，给自己的党、同志、父母和妻儿，写下了遗书。他们坚信美丽的祖国一定解放，共产主义事业一定胜利。他们把参加这一斗争和为它而牺牲当作最大的荣耀。他们告诉同志们要勇敢，要细心，要继承他们的遗志，并且严惩叛国的敌人。然后他们昂着头高唱国际歌，骄傲地为人民而死。
    从这些信里，我们看到：这些特殊材料制成的烈士们所以能这样坚定，是因为他们有着伟大的理想，直到最后一分钟，他们都感到自豪，因为他们选择了一条正确的路，一条把祖国和全世界的人民引向幸福的路。在这条路上，他们为祖国，为劳动人类，为孩子们的将来而正直地工作着。他们都充满了信心，像艾·尔·商比翁的信里所说：“穿过流血的斗争，无论在东方和西方，南方和北方，都正透现出曙光。”
    在活着的时候，共产党人鞠躬尽瘁。而当祖国和共产主义事业需要他们牺牲的时候，他们又是视死如归。敌人宣判他们的死刑，是在他们意料中的。他们连眉毛都不动，甚至微笑着轻蔑地迎接了判决。年青的安德列·久兰在信里说：“我会像战斗时一样英勇地死去。我是一个革命的士兵。我的心将同党一起活着。我们高声地唱着自己的歌，为我们的党去死。”他们是无愧于祖国和人民了。
    是的，只有共产党人最懂得生命的意义。他们决不虚度一分光阴。他们热爱生命和自由，渴望光明的将来。因此，临死时他们是不能不感到遗憾的。莫列士·卡拉热特说：“唉，要能活到光明的日子，亲眼看见一切可多好啊！但是，可安慰的是，我们不会被遗忘的，因为我们参加了这一美好的未来的创造。”罗伯尔·阿美里也是说：“我想活着：为了向我们的刽子手们报仇。不过也没有什么，别的人会为我们报仇的。”他们明白自己是为人类的幸福而牺牲，若望·罗伯尔说：“我们的许多同志牺牲了，还有许多同志会牺牲，但是报偿的日子已经临近了，………，我们相信，会有成千成万的爱国者起来代替被敌人处死的我们，来继续那将给全世界人民带来自由和幸福的斗争。”他们对于活着的同志们的希望，就是：“祝你们更勇敢！”这是他们的口号。当莫列士·卡拉热特知道他的妻子已经接替了他的工作时，他感到幸福和骄傲，他说：“但是，你要细心………”
    当我们读着“血的记录”的时候，我们好像听到了战士们的坚强的声音。让我们听听安德列·戴耳蒙在被绞死前几分钟写的话吧。他写道：“我的全部思想此时向往着我们的亲爱的党，向往着各国人民的英勇的解放斗争，向往着我们的亲爱的斯大林，向往着我们今天就要为它交出生命的斗争，我们正视着刽子手的眼睛，泰然地交出我们的生命，我们自豪我们是为我们苦难的祖国而死，同时知道，明天我们的祖国就会复活的。”
    “血的记录”这本书强烈地告诉我们：无论在哪一个国度，真理只是一个：共产主义是不可抗御的！每一个关心全世界各国共产主义斗争的人，都应看一看这本血写的纪录和预言。（彦祥）
    “绞索勒着脖子时的报告”
    （伏契克著刘辽逸译大连光华书店版）
    这一本著作最近荣获世界保卫和平大会常设委员会的特别荣誉奖金。作者是捷克著名作家和烈士——尤利斯·伏契克同志。当希特勒法西斯占领时期，作者忘我地为党为人民进行了艰苦复杂的地下斗争；不幸于一九四二年四月被捕，经过不可想像的严刑拷打和威胁利诱而坚贞不屈的伏契克于一九四三年九月被杀害于柏林。“绞索勒着脖子时的报告”就是作者在卓越的地下工作者——Ａ·克灵斯基（任监狱看守）供给纸和铅笔的帮助下写成的。
    “绞索勒着脖子时的报告”记下了他的狱中生活、人物和思想，是政治性与艺术性高度结合的典范。应当指出：杰出的战斗风格是这篇著作最凸出的特点；对敌人不可调和的尖刻讽刺和对自己事业的无限信心贯彻着全书的每一个字。
    用作者自己的话可以说明：什么力量驱使作者在那样恐怖的法西斯监狱里写出这个不朽的著作：
    “……不要忘记！不要忘记善人和恶人。耐心地搜集那些为着自己和为着你们而牺牲了的人们的证据。现在将成为过去，人们谈论伟大的时代和谈论创造历史的无名英雄的一天一定到来。……让那些在战斗中的牺牲者使你们觉得像朋友，像祖国，像你们自己那样亲近吧！”
    当法西斯野兽们对伏契克施以惨不忍睹的拷打时，他从心底发出了这样的声音：
    “可是我仍然还是不能死去。妈妈，妈妈，为什么我生得这样强健呢？”这是大无畏的共产主义者的充满人性的呼声。“我爱生活，并且为着它的美而去战斗。……我为欢乐而生，为欢乐而死，在我的坟墓上安放悲哀的安琪儿是不公正的。”这是对生命的歌颂，对革命事业的欢呼！
    同时，作者也歌颂了那些自己所目睹的英雄们的形象。他们之中，有的穿着敌人的制服，冒着非常的危险，“为的是不让在系着锁链的今天和自由的明天之间的联系中断”。有的在平时谦逊而不为人注意地工作着，而当不幸被捕时，他们在严刑之前紧闭着嘴唇；临死时，他们纯朴地说：“不要怜悯我，……我做了工人的义务所责成我的一切，我没有叛变这个义务而死去。”有的在临赴刑场时向同志们告别后，对特务刽子手们说：“你们一点办法都没有的。我们的人牺牲了不少，但最后被粉碎的仍然是你们。”总之，他们都是真正的人；他们考虑的不是自己，而是集体；他们为今日的战斗和明日的欢乐而生活着；他们是共产主义的千千万万的英雄——不朽的人们。
    作者的“狱中日记”在一九四二年九月八日以后，就不能继续写下去了，法西斯匪徒们夺去了他那充满热情和勇气的生命。作者最后警告我们：
    “人们，我是爱你们的！你们可要警惕啊！”
    当帝国主义者还存在的时候，一切特务匪徒们是不会甘心死去的。伏契克教导我们认识敌人，仇恨敌人，同时更要警惕敌人。这一点也是我们不能轻轻放过的。（赵履宽）
    编者按：这本书三联书店已有再版，改名“绞刑架上”。
