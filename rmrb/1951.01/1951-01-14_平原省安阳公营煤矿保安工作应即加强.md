To the Editor:

In the Anyang County-run Wangjialing Coal Mine in Pingyuan, six accidents, both large and small, occurred in the two months from October to mid-December last year. In October, due to water overflowing from two large kilns, the administrative side pandered to the "tails" of the foremen and made vows to "Lord Lao" and put on a play. However, on November 7, worker Guo Yusheng fell into the kiln from the mine entrance, breaking both legs; on November 9, the shed at the water lifting well caught fire; on November 13, worker Wang Ergui's foot was injured by a boiler; on November 19, the material section's building was burned down; and on December 16, the workers' rest room before work caught fire again.

Why are these troubles happening constantly? The main reason is that the Anyang County government does not pay attention to the safety equipment and management of the mine. The mine was handed over to a county government accountant who has neither scientific knowledge nor technical skills to manage it, and the county government has not sent anyone to inspect the work. The following few things can illustrate how irresponsible the Anyang County government is towards the mine.

	1. The boiler is located on the side of the main road, which is always at risk of being sabotaged by destructive elements.

	2. There are no railings at the entrances of the five coal kilns. If one is not careful, workers are in danger of falling into the well and dying.

	3. The small house at the entrance of the level kiln has only enough space for two or three people to stand besides the well entrance. Half of the back wall has collapsed. This is the throat through which workers go up and down the kiln well, how dangerous!

	4. The workers' rest room before work is a pit, with a small wall made of broken baskets filled with soil on one side, and a roof made of dry grass. The pit is filled with dry grass, and a coal stove two and a half feet high is lit because it is cold, which often causes fires.

	5. The number two air vent is surrounded by broken baskets filled with soil. A large pile of coal is burning underground, which makes the air underground bad and also poses a great risk of fire.

	6. The sixth dormitory for workers above ground is a cave that has been put together, and the sleeping berths inside are just stone cliffs.

	7. The roof of the blacksmith's furnace for repairing tools is covered with reeds. When the iron furnace is lit, the flames reach the roof, which is really dangerous.

Judging from the above situation, is this considered a public enterprise? Why is it like this? It is obvious that the Anyang County government is proceeding solely from a profit-making point of view, seeking more dividends, while neglecting the safety of the workers' lives. When the house was burned down, Manager Li said, "It doesn't matter, we'll rebuild it after it burns down." He seems very generous, but it is too economical to build such a house.

The competent authority of this mine (the county government), which does not rely on workers and does not pay attention to the safety and health of workers, should conduct a thorough and profound inspection and correct it quickly.

Editor's Note:

Recently, accidents have occurred continuously in small coal kilns in various places. This is because operators have not paid attention to safety equipment, and local governments have been negligent in inspection. In some mining areas, farmers gather in groups of three or five in winter to dig coal privately in "old kilns" or "dangerous kilns" without any equipment, which also results in casualties. Mining authorities and county industry and commerce departments in various places should quickly strengthen the inspection and management of small kilns and "old kilns" and "dangerous kilns".

### 平原省安阳公营煤矿保安工作应即加强

　　平原省安阳公营煤矿保安工作应即加强编辑同志：
    平原安阳县公营王家岭煤矿，从去年十月到十二月中旬两个多月的时间内，大小出了六次事故。十月间因两大窑下出水，行政方面当了把头们的“尾巴”，给“老君爷”许愿唱了戏。但十一月七日工友郭玉生从煤矿井口摔下窑去，将两腿跌断；十一月九日提水井口席棚失火；十一月十三日拉锅炉轧伤了工友王二贵的脚；十一月十九日材料股的房子被火烧了；十二月十六日工人上班前的休息室又闹了火灾。
    为什么乱子不断出呢？主要原因是：安阳县府领导上不重视矿山的安全设备和管理工作。将矿厂只交给了一个既无科学常识又无技术的县府会计员去管理，而县府也没派人检查过工作。下列几件事情，即可说明安阳县府对该矿是如何不负责任。
    １、锅炉设在大路边上，这随时都有被破坏分子破坏的危险。
    ２、五个煤窑的井口都没栏杆，一不小心，工人就有掉下井摔死的危险。
    ３、平窑井口的小房子，里面除井口以外，仅有站两三个人的空隙。后墙已经塌了半边，这是工人们上下窑井的咽喉要道，多么危险呀！
    ４、工人们上班前的休息室，是一个土坑，一面是用破筐装土作成的小墙，上面是用干草作的顶棚。坑里铺满了干草，因为天冷生了个二尺半高的煤火炉，因而时常发生失火的事情。
    ５、出风的二号井口是用破筐装土围起来的，井下烧着大堆煤火，致使井下空气不好，也有失火的极大危险。
    ６、井上工人第六宿舍，是凑了个山洞盖起来的，里面的睡铺就是石崖。
    ７、修理工具的铁匠炉，房顶是用苇草盖的，铁炉生火时，火苗就顶到房顶，真危险。
    从上面这些情况来看，这算是公营企业吗？为什么这样呢？很明显地这是安阳县府单从营利观点出发，多得红利，而忽视了工人的生命安全。像房子烧坏了，李经理说：“不要紧，烧了再盖。”看来很大方，不过盖这样的房子，是太节约了。
    这种不依靠工人，不注意工人的安全卫生的该矿主管机关（县政府）应当很好地深刻检查，迅速纠正。
                                                  读者  徐民
    编者按：
    近来，各地小煤窑不断发生事故，这是经营者没有注意安全设备，而当地政府又疏于检查所致。某些矿区农民在冬季三五成群，私自在毫无设备的“老窑”或“危险窑”掘煤，亦发生伤亡事件。各地矿务机关及县的工商科，应从速加强对各小窑和“老窑”、“危险窑”的检查和管理工作。
