　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th dispatch from TASS: A reporter from the Workers' Daily reports from Bismarck (capital of North Dakota): The state's Senate has passed a resolution demanding that Congress and Truman immediately order the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. The result of the vote was thirty-six in favor and only five against. The resolution declares: The United States' involvement in the Korean conflict did not establish whether the American people were willing to accept this adventure. Republican Senator Trosell said, "If anyone opposes this resolution, it would be best to ask him to go to Korea for a few days."
　　The Workers' Daily also reported that Wisconsin Senator Demsey wrote a letter to the Capital Times, published in Madison, advocating the recall of all American troops stationed abroad. Demsey wrote: If the United States spends as much money on peace in the next thirty-six years as it has spent on war in the past thirty-six years, "then the world will bloom like roses."

　　美国北达科他州参议院决议
    要求美军撤出朝鲜
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约十七日讯：工人日报记者自俾斯麦城（北达科他州首府）报道：该州的州参议院通过一项决议，要求国会和杜鲁门马上命令美国军队撤出朝鲜。表决的结果是三十六票赞成，反对的只有五票。决议宣称：美国置身于朝鲜冲突时，并没有确定美国人民是否愿接受这种冒险。共和党参议员特罗塞尔说：“如果有人反对这项决议，最好请他到朝鲜去几天。”
    工人日报又报道，威斯康星州参议员典普塞致函在麦迪逊出版的首府时代报，主张召回驻在国外的所有美国军队。典普塞写道：假如美国在今后三十六年中把钱花在和平上面，像过去三十六年中花在战争上的一样多，“那么，世界便会开出玫瑰一般的花朵。”
