(Reported by this newspaper) Trade union work across the country achieved significant accomplishments in 1950. On the original foundation, trade union organizations were consolidated and expanded, and through trade union organizations, production was powerfully promoted. Currently, there are more than 4.9 million trade union members nationwide; employees in major industrial sectors and important cities have basically been organized.

　　The Northeast is an important industrial base in our country. Over the past year, the trade unions in this region have recruited 1.05 million members and organized more than 1.6 million workers to actively engage in production. A large number of labor model figures emerged in the patriotic production competition movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The total output of the region in the first half of last year exceeded the original production plan by 5.7 percent. With the development of production, the phenomenon of worker unemployment has basically been eliminated in the Northeast region.

　　The trade union work in East China over the past year has been carried out in the midst of mobilizing the vast number of employees to take over and transform the production institutions of bureaucratic capital, and engaging in fierce struggles with imperialist blockades and sabotage. The working class after liberation overcame various difficulties and strengthened its own organization. More than 60 percent of workers in East China have now joined trade union organizations. The Kuomintang reactionaries created a large number of unemployed workers before liberation. Over the past year, East China has adopted methods such as work-for-relief, combined with production for self-salvation and vocational training, to gradually solve the problem of worker unemployment. In Hangzhou alone, more than 11,000 of the 20,000 unemployed workers have had their employment issues reasonably resolved.

　　In the six provinces and two cities of Central South China, more than 1.8 million of the 3 million employees have been organized, including more than 90 percent of industrial workers who have joined trade unions. Under the leadership of the trade unions, workers in Central South China have actively strived to improve the production situation in state-owned factories significantly compared to a year ago. For example, the average coal consumption rate per degree of electricity generated by a certain hydroelectric company has been reduced by 1.164 kilograms, which has greatly reduced production costs. Employees in private enterprises have also actively united with capitalists to jointly overcome some temporary difficulties.

　　Workers in the five provinces of North China and the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin have made excellent contributions to production over the past year. Most employees in North China have joined trade unions. According to statistics from Hebei Province, there are more than 450,000 employees in the province, with more than 190,000 members. Excluding more than 200,000 teachers and staff in government agencies and schools, 75 percent of industrial workers in the region have joined trade unions. Over the past year, trade union organizations in the province have purged more than 1,200 bad elements, purifying their own organizations. In Datong City, Chahar Province, 60 percent of employees in public and private enterprises have joined trade unions; the rate reaches 80 to 90 percent in state-owned factories and mines.

　　In the Northwest region, under the leadership of the trade unions, the working class has assisted the government in taking over cities, establishing political power, and striving to restore and develop production over the past year. The region convened the Northwest Trade Union Work Conference in October of the year before last to discuss various issues in trade union work. Since then, trade union work has shown a new look. Currently, the total number of industrial workers in the Northwest region is more than 89,000, and more than 57,000 have joined trade unions. Region-wide trade union organizations have been established in railways, postal services, telecommunications, and textiles. In state-owned factories in various regions, the grassroots trade unions have cooperated with administrative departments to implement the principles of "enterprise management" and "democratic administration," which has greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of the working masses.

　　The Southwest region was liberated relatively late, and trade union work has also achieved certain results. Chongqing City has more than 86,000 trade union members, accounting for more than 38 percent of the city's total employees. Trade union organizations in enterprises such as ordnance, postal services, telecommunications, and electricity are relatively sound.

　　Trade unions across the country have done a series of work in terms of worker welfare. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' call to launch a movement to relieve unemployed workers has been warmly supported by employees across the country. The total amount of donations from various places has reached 31.285 billion yuan. In addition, the government has allocated a large amount of unemployment relief funds, effectively assisting unemployed worker brothers. Various localities attach great importance to workers' spare-time education. According to statistics, more than 700,000 employees across the country regularly participate in spare-time school studies, achieving certain results in improving the political, cultural, and technical levels of the vast number of workers.

　　Over the past year, trade unions have also helped the government draft several major laws and regulations related to labor protection, such as the draft factory safety and hygiene regulations and the draft labor insurance regulations. Currently, 1.2 million workers across the country are enjoying the benefits of the national labor insurance regulations, and they will soon be implemented on a trial basis across the country.

　　去年一年工会工作获成绩
    全国工会会员近五百万   
    有力地推动了国家生产建设事业
    【本报讯】一九五○年全国工会工作获得重大成就，在原有基础上巩固与扩大了工会组织，并通过工会组织，有力地推动了生产。目前，全国共有工会会员四百九十余万人；各主要产业部门和重要城市中的职工，已基本上组织起来。
    东北是我国重要工业基地。一年来，该区工会吸收了一百零五万会员，组织了一百六十余万工人积极地进行生产，在抗美援朝爱国主义生产竞赛运动中，涌现出大批的劳动模范人物。全区去年上半年总产量超过原生产计划的百分之五点七。随着生产的发展，东北区已基本上消灭了工人失业现象。
    华东区一年来的工会工作，是在发动广大职工接管、改造官僚资本的生产机构，并与帝国主义封锁、破坏进行激烈斗争中进行的。解放后的工人阶级克服了种种困难，壮大了自己的组织。华东区现已有百分之六十以上的工人参加了工会组织。国民党反动派在解放前曾制造了大批失业工人。一年来华东区采取了以工代赈，结合生产自救和转业训练等办法来逐步求得解决工人失业问题。仅杭州一市，二万失业工人中就有一万一千余人合理解决了就业问题。
    中南区六省二市三百万职工，已有一百八十余万组织起来，其中产业工人已有百分之九十以上参加了工会。中南区工人在工会领导下，在公营工厂中，积极努力已使生产情况较一年前有显著好转。如某水电公司平均燃煤率每度已较前减少一点一六四公斤，这就大大减低了生产成本。私营企业的职工也曾积极团结资方，共同协力克服某些暂时的困难。
    华北五省及京津二市的工人一年来在生产上有着很好的贡献。华北区大部职工已参加了工会。据河北省统计，全省共有职工四十五万余人，已有会员十九万余人，除去二十多万机关和学校的职教人员外，全区产业工人已有百分之七十五参加了工会。该省工会组织一年来曾清洗了坏分子一千二百余人，纯洁了自己的组织。察哈尔大同市公私企业职工已有百分之六十参加了工会；公营厂矿则达百分之八十至九十。
    西北区过去一年来，工人阶级在工会领导下，曾协助政府接管城市，建立政权，并努力恢复和发展生产。该区于前年十月间召开了西北工会工作会议，研讨了工会工作中的各种问题。此后，工会工作出现了崭新的局面。现在，西北全区产业工人总数为八万九千余人，参加工会的已有五万七千余人。铁路、邮电、纺织并已有了全区性的工会组织。该地各区公营工厂中基层工会配合行政部门执行了《经营企业化》与《管理民主化》的方针，大大启发了工人群众的生产积极性。
    西南区解放较晚，工会工作也已获得一定成绩。重庆市已有工会会员八万六千余人，占全市职工总数的百分之三十八强。其中兵工、邮电、电业等企业工会组织较为健全。
    全国各地工会在工人福利方面曾做了一系列的工作。全国总工会号召的开展救济失业工人运动，获得了全国各地职工的热烈拥护，总计各地捐款数目达三百一十二亿八千五百余万元之巨，此外并请政府拨发了大批失业救济金，有效地援助了失业的工人兄弟。各地对职工业余教育极为重视，据统计，目前全国已有七十余万职工经常参加业余学校学习，在提高广大工人政治、文化、技术水平方面，取得了一定的成绩。
    一年来，工会并帮助政府起草了几个重大的有关劳动保护的法令，如工厂安全卫生条例草案、劳动保险条例草案等。现在，全国已有一百二十万工人享受着国家劳动保险条例的待遇，并且不久即将在全国试行。
