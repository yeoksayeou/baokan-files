People Across the Country Warmly Greet the People's Volunteer Army
"Your victory in Korea makes us feel immensely proud to be Chinese!"
　　Before New Year's Eve, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression received over 4,000 letters of greetings from people from all walks of life in the city entrusted to be forwarded to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, as well as 1.26 billion yuan in consolation money (RMB), over 5,300 consolation bags, and many pieces of medicine and other daily necessities. The letter of greeting from labor models attending the National Labor Model Conference, such as Ruan Kaili, stated: We workers guarantee to do a good job in the patriotic production competition, and step up production as you are fighting on the front lines. The collective letter of greeting from housewives said: Every mother will educate our children with your exemplary heroic behavior. Fourteen elderly gentlemen, including Feng Zikai, Jiang Yong, and Xu Langxi, specially invited representatives to the second Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference, jointly wrote letters to express their sincere greetings and highest respect to the soldiers. Residents of 43 lane buildings in Huangpu District said in a joint letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: Thanks to your brave fighting, we are filled with pride and feel immensely honored to be Chinese.
    The first batch of greetings from the people of Dalian to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield was sent to Korea before the New Year. The greetings included 100,000 consolation bags, 100,000 towels, 100,000 boxes of cigarettes, 100,000 bars of soap, and a large number of greeting letters. Many consolation bags were filled with cherished items that people had treasured for a long time. Wu Jinfeng, an old woman from Friendship Square in Dalian, spent two nights embroidering a consolation bag and put a floral towel that she had kept unused for three or four years inside. Liang Fengying, a female worker from the platform car branch of the railway factory, also put her award from production and study and an embroidered pillow prepared for her wedding into the consolation bag.
    The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression received more than 5,700 letters of greetings entrusted by people from all walks of life in the city within a week before New Year's Eve, as well as consolation money, pennants, and a large number of daily necessities such as towels, toothbrushes, soap, and socks.
    More than 500 representatives attending the Third Guangzhou Municipal People's Representative Conference wrote letters of greetings. Worker representative Huang Shaoquan said in his letter: We, the working class, guarantee to win victories on the production front to show our determination to support you. Women representative Su Hui told the Volunteer Army comrades in her letter: The Guangdong sisters have made a large number of cotton-padded clothes and quilts for you. When you wear these military uniforms, you can feel the warm greetings from more than 17 million Guangdong sisters. May you more bravely strike at the American robbers. Farmers in the suburbs who are undergoing land reform expressed their determination to support the People's Volunteer Army in their letters of greetings. Farmers in Shixi Village, Lijiao District, wrote in their letter: We farmers unite to defeat the landlord class and work hard to produce, using these practical actions to show our support for you. A large amount of consolation money and goods donated by people from all walks of life are being gathered for distribution.
    The consolation movement in small and medium-sized cities in the Central and Southern China region is flourishing. The medical community in Kaifeng City, Henan Province, donated penicillin and other medicines. The business community in Zhumadian donated a large number of notebooks and pencils, and wrote on the learning brochures: "Please record your immortal heroic deeds." The business community in Zhuji City donated more than 1,000 pairs of gloves. Workers at the Anjiang Yarn Factory in Hunan donated their overtime pay to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    On New Year's Day in 1951, the Macao Federation of Trade Unions, Chamber of Commerce, Women's Federation, Student Federation, Chinese Association, New Association, and Educational Association sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front to congratulate them on the New Year. The telegram read:
    "In order to stop aggression, actively defend our homes and country, and defend peace, you bravely volunteered to support our Korean brothers, crushed the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism, strengthened the will of the Asian people to fight for peace and freedom, and encouraged the world's people's confidence in victory against aggression. We firmly support your just actions. We send our congratulations and wish you a happy New Year."
