　　Popularizing the National Comforting Movement
    Hu Zhongchi
    A vigorous comforting movement has unfolded throughout the country. As of New Year's Eve last year, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression had received a large number of letters and goods from Beijing and 17 branches across the country to comfort the Chinese and Korean soldiers on the Korean front. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 178,167 letters of sympathy were received, along with ¥1,207,756,876 in慰问(comfort) money, ¥184,994,000 in Northeast currency, 12,386 comfort bags, and 207,625 other慰问(comfort) items. In addition, there were platinum rings, gold rings, gold nuggets, gold jewelry, US dollars, silver dollars, millet, rice, wage coupons, grain coupons, and more.
    The Chinese working class is very concerned about the Korean War. Their support is also very active. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions wrote in a letter to the Chinese People's Volunteers on December 30: "Your victory has inspired the vast people of the world who are fighting for peace, and it has also inspired the Chinese people's determination to fight for peace. The working class throughout the country will support you with patriotic production competitions." The National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union forwarded慰问(comfort) goods sent by textile workers from various places to the Korean Embassy in China on December 26. Railway workers across the country also launched a campaign in early December to慰问(comfort) the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. The entire workforce of the Beijing Engineering Section wrote in an accompanying letter to the comfort bag: "This is a token of our appreciation. Use the towel to wipe away your sweat so you can pursue the enemy, and use the soap to wash away the enemy's blood splattered on you." The letter written by all the employees of Zhao Guoyou's lathe department in the Second Manufacturing Workshop of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory said: "Comrades! You are fighting alongside the Korean People's Army in the front, and we are turning the factory into a battlefield and the machines into weapons in the rear; we will supply whatever you need, and we will definitely make the patriotic production competition to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard our homes and defend the country more extensive and in-depth to support you."
    Many workers across the country donated a percentage of their wages as慰问(comfort) money. For example, the 80,000 employees in Fushun dedicated one day of work, workers at the Shanghai Telephone Company donated one million bullets, and workers in Guangzhou donated bullets and hand grenades, are all notable examples.
    Amidst the upsurge of the campaign to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard our homes and defend the country, Chinese farmers are also supporting the heroic battles of the Chinese and Korean people on the Korean front with enthusiastic actions. Farmers in various parts of Northeast China have dried the fresh vegetables harvested this year into dried vegetables or sent the fattened pigs they raised to the Korean front, and voluntarily organized stretcher teams to serve on the front. Farmers in various provinces and cities are vying to hand in public grain to support the front. Farmers in the Third District of Taiyuan City contributed 12,000 catties of salary rice on December 11 to慰问(comfort) the volunteers on the Korean front.
    Chinese youth and students are filled with great enthusiasm for the慰问(comfort) actions of the heroic People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Organizations such as the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students Federation jointly wrote a letter to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on December 27, saying: "Chinese youth, members of the Communist Youth League, and students are cheering for your great victory and are actively learning from your glorious example." Comfort movements have been widely launched in major middle schools across the country. Among the慰问(comfort) items in major middle schools in the capital, there are various gifts with profound meanings. Bai Qizhang of the Electrical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University donated a six-tube battery-powered radio that he had repaired himself. Someone named Zhang Yan wrote on the camera he donated: "Please capture the atrocities of American imperialism into the lens and make them public to the world."
    Zheng Lansun, chairman of the Shanghai Student Federation, at the Shanghai People's Congress to Resist America, Aid Korea, Safeguard our Homes and Defend the Country on December 6, in addition to mobilizing students to participate in military cadre schools, also launched a campaign of one慰问(comfort) letter per person, and one bullet donated per person, with all Shanghai students donating a "Student" aircraft. This call has been unanimously responded to by the student community in Shanghai. Zheng Mengshi, a student at Shaoxing High School in Zhejiang, wrote a letter from his sickbed to the soldiers of the People's Volunteers, deeply regretting that he was lying alone in the hospital and had no opportunity to participate in the military cadre school. The letter said: "I wish you a quick annihilation of the fascist bandits and a victorious return. I hope I can live to hear you sing your triumphant songs."
    Fifty-eight students from the Guangzhou Duan Na Nursing School formed a blood transfusion team, volunteering to donate blood for frontline soldiers.
    Middle schools in various counties of Henan Province widely launched a "one bullet" movement in mid-December. Students at Kaifeng High School even voluntarily donated the coal they used for heating, converting it into bullets and donating it to the Volunteers, because they felt that doing so was more heart-warming than heating the fire.
    The慰问(comfort) letters written by elementary school students from various provinces and cities to the Korean front are like snowflakes.
    Literary and art workers across the country are enthusiastically engaged in creation to慰问(comfort) Korean soldiers. Poets write poems, painters paint, and composers write songs to send to the front. Writers Ding Ling, Lao She, Ai Qing, Zhang Tianyi, Jin Yi, etc. all wrote慰问(comfort) letters to the front. Zhang Tianyi wrote in his letter: "What do you need, what do you want to read, just tell us, and we will try to do it for you."
    Women in various places also showed great enthusiasm in the comforting movement. Women's organizations in the capital, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other major cities have called for writing慰问(comfort) letters and sending comfort bags. More than 1,000 working women in Shijiazhuang made more than 60,000 military quilts in 28 days up to December 12 to慰问(comfort) the Korean front.
    Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army wrote letters from various garrisons to慰问(comfort) the People's Volunteers on the Korean front. Peng Shuoming, a cadre and soldier of the Navy Political Department, sewed the prizes awarded to him by the war exhibition into comfort bags and sent them to the heroic People's Volunteers.
    The industrial and commercial sectors of Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Wuhan and other major cities also launched a comforting movement in December. Patriotic industrialists and businessmen packed all kinds of food and supplies into comfort bags and dedicated them to the heroic soldiers on the Korean front. Movie theaters in major cities all took a portion of their ticket revenue as慰问(comfort) money. Zhang Jinru, manager of the Tianjin branch of Tianjin Jufeng Hua Bank, voluntarily donated 50 million yuan to慰问(comfort) the People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Liu Hongsheng, an industrialist in Shanghai, donated 1,000 pure domestic wool underwear, produced by the Northwest Wool Combing Factory, to the People's Volunteers. The Chongqing industrial and commercial sectors held a grand parade on December 8 to celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang, sending a telegram to congratulate and慰问(comfort) the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Wuhan industrial and commercial sectors held a demonstration parade on December 12 to celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang, presenting two banners to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army.
    People from all ethnic groups in the Northwest are supporting and comforting the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers with enthusiastic feelings and active actions. 1.5 million people from the Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, Dongxiang and other ethnic minorities in Gansu wrote to the Korean People's Army, saying: "We are determined to strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups and suppress counter-revolutionary activities with practical actions, and fully support your righteous and heroic struggle, and give the American imperialists a relentless blow." Nima, the housekeeper of Xia Lihua Living Buddha of the Mongolian nationality in Heifeng County, Xinjiang, donated five taels of placer gold and ten silver ingots to慰问(comfort) the Korean front. The Great Lama Gongqing also donated ten silver ingots as慰问(comfort) money.
    The upsurge of the national-scale comforting movement demonstrates the high degree of patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese people. This spirit will provide a more solid guarantee for the historic great victory of the Chinese and Korean people.

　　普及全国的慰劳运动
    胡仲持
    在全国，已经开展了轰轰烈烈的慰劳运动。截至去年除夕为止，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会已从北京及全国各地十七个分会收到大批慰劳朝鲜前线中朝两国战士的信件和物品。据不完全的统计，共计慰问信一七八、一六七封，慰问金人民币一、二○七、七五六、八七六元，东北币一八四、九九四、○○○元，慰问袋一二、三八六个，其他慰问品二○七、六二五件。此外尚有白金戒、黄金戒、金块、金首饰、美钞、银元、小米、大米、薪工券、粮票等。
    中国工人阶级对于朝鲜战争是十分关切的。支持也是十分积极的。中华全国总工会十二月三十日致中国志愿军的信中说：“你们的胜利鼓舞了全世界为争取和平而奋斗的广大人民，也鼓舞了中国人民为争取和平而奋斗的决心。全国工人阶级将以爱国主义的生产竞赛来支援你们。”中国纺织工会全国委员会于十二月二十六日将各地纺织职工所送的慰劳品转送朝鲜驻中国大使馆。全国铁路职工在十二月上旬也展开了慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的行动。北京工务段工区全体工人在慰问袋的附信上写着：“这是我们的一点心意，用毛巾擦干你们的汗水，好去追击敌人，用肥皂洗净溅在你们身上的敌人的血腥。”沈阳第三机器厂第二制造场赵国有车工部全体职工所写的信上说：“同志们！你们在前方跟朝鲜人民军并肩杀敌，我们在后方把工厂变成战场，把机器变成武器；你们要什么我们就供给什么，一定把抗美援朝保家卫国的生产竞赛搞的更广泛深入，来支援你们。”
    全国许多工人从自己的工资提成捐作慰劳金。如抚顺八万职工献工一天，上海电话公司工人捐献一百万发子弹，广州市工人捐献子弹及手榴弹，就是显著的例子。
    中国的农民们在抗美援朝保家卫国运动的高潮中，也正以热烈的行动，支援朝鲜前线中朝人民的英勇战斗。东北各地农民们纷纷将今年收获的新鲜蔬菜晒成菜干或把所养的肥猪送往朝鲜前线，并自愿组织担架队到前线服务。各省市农民争先缴纳公粮，支援前线。太原市三区农民于十二月十一日献工资米一万二千斤，慰劳朝鲜前线志愿军。
    中国青年和学生，对于英勇的人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的慰劳行动充满了极大的热情。青年团中央、全国青联、全国学联等团体于十二月二十七日联合写信给中国人民志愿军的指战员说：“中国的青年、青年团员和学生都为你们的伟大胜利而欢呼，并积极学习你们的光辉榜样。”全国各大中学广泛地发动了慰劳运动。在首都各大中学的慰劳品中间，有各种含意深长的礼物。清华大学电机系的白其章献出了亲手修复的一部六管电池式收音机。有署名张演的在自己捐献的照像机上写着：“请把美帝国主义的暴行摄入镜头，公诸全世界。”
    上海学联主席郑兰荪于十二月六日在上海市各界人民抗美援朝保家卫国代表会议上，除发动同学们参加军事干部学校外，还发动一人一封慰劳信，一人捐献一颗子弹，全上海同学们捐献“学生号”飞机一架。这个号召业已获得全上海学生界的一致响应。浙江绍兴高中学生郑蒙士从病床上写信给人民志愿军战士，深憾自己孤独地躺在医院里，没有机会参加军事干校，信上说：“我祝福你们很快的消灭法西斯强盗，胜利归来，我盼望我能够活到听见你们高唱凯歌的时候。”
    广州端拿护士学校学生五十八人组成了输血队，志愿为前线战士输血。
    河南省各县中学在十二月中广泛地开展了一粒子弹运动。开封高中的同学们甚至自愿地把取暖的煤捐出折成子弹，献给志愿军，因为他们觉得这么做比烤火更能暖透人心。
    各省市小学生们写到朝鲜前线去的慰劳信像雪片一样多。
    全国文艺工作者们为慰问朝鲜战士而热情地从事创作，诗人写诗，画家作画，作曲家写歌曲投寄到前线去。作家丁玲、老舍、艾青、张天翼、靳以等都写了慰问信到前线去。张天翼的信里说：“你们需要些什么，要阅读些什么，尽管告诉我们，我们试着替你们办。”
    各地妇女在慰劳运动中也表现了极大的热情。首都、上海、天津及其他各大城市的妇女团体纷纷号召写慰劳信，寄慰劳袋。石家庄市一千多名劳动妇女在十二月十二日为止的二十八天内做成了六万余床军被，慰劳朝鲜前线。
    人民解放军战士从各驻防地点纷纷写信慰劳朝鲜前线人民志愿军。海军政治部干部战士彭硕明把战迹展览会发给他的奖品缝成慰问袋，送给英勇的人民志愿军。
    上海、天津、重庆、武汉及各大城市的工商界，在十二月间也展开了慰劳运动。爱国的工商业者把各色各样吃的用的物品装成慰劳袋，献给朝鲜前线的英勇将士。各大城市的电影院都从票价收入提出一部分作慰劳金。天津聚丰华行天津分行经理张金如自动捐款五千万元，慰劳人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。上海工业家刘鸿生以西北羊毛整理厂的出品，纯国毛内衣一千件捐献人民志愿军。重庆市工商界于十二月八日举行平壤解放庆祝大游行，致电祝贺并慰问朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。武汉市工商界于十二月十二日举行庆祝平壤解放示威游行大会以锦旗两面献给中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。
    西北各族各界人民都以热烈的心情和积极的行动支援与慰问英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。甘肃回、藏、蒙、维吾尔、哈萨克、东乡等少数民族一百五十万人写信给朝鲜人民军说：“我们坚决以加强各民族团结、镇压反革命活动的实际行动，全力支援您们正义的英勇斗争，给美帝国主义以无情的打击。”新疆和丰县蒙族夏律瓦活佛管家尼玛等以沙金五两、元宝十个，慰劳朝鲜前线。公庆大喇嘛也献出了元宝十个作慰劳金。
    全国规模的慰劳运动的热潮表现了中国人民的高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神。这种精神，将使中朝人民的历史性的伟大胜利得到更巩固的保证。
