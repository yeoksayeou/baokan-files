Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Republican leader Dulles, in the capacity of a senior advisor to the US Secretary of State, delivered a foreign policy speech in New York on December 29th of last year, refuting the views of another Republican leader Hoover, and attempting to defend the current aggressive policy of the Truman administration, which has suffered a shameful defeat.

　　In his speech, Dulles asserted that Hoover's so-called "withdrawal from the continent" aggressive policy was equally hopeless. He criticized, saying, "This theory is flawed." He believed that this method of threatening so-called "allies" who are not working hard enough with "withdrawal" would only further disintegrate the imperialist camp, thus putting the United States in a more isolated and collapsed position. Dulles argued, "If a country abandons those allies who are suffering the greatest danger, whose fates are intertwined because of solemn treaties, common traditions, and wartime and peacetime friendship, at the most critical moment, then it will not be qualified to choose any country for itself in the future." "The mindset of formulating such a defense plan contains the seeds of its own collapse."

　　However, Dulles could not but admit that the Truman administration's current overall aggression policy has been utterly defeated and is pregnant with serious crises. Dulles was forced to say: "I would never say that everything our country has done in all these aspects has been done perfectly." When talking about the US imperialist aggression adventure in Korea, Dulles could not hide the fact that the invading army had "suffered serious setbacks." Dulles admitted the failure of the Marshall Plan, saying, "The loans and grants we have given to others may have had some temporary relief effects, but have failed to encourage them to boldly establish new unity and strength." He also said: "The United States and the United Nations (which should be the majority controlled by the United States) may have undertaken political responsibilities that they did not have the power to support, policies… often cannot be effectively and timely implemented. Some serious and perhaps unnecessary setbacks have occurred." He believed that: "The mistake of the free world (referring to the imperialist bloc) lies in relying too much on potential power and failing to establish sufficient actual military power." Dulles was deeply saddened by the lack of coordination within the imperialist camp, especially in military operations, saying: "When it comes to pure military strategy, the free world seems to be in a state of confusion at all times, with no agreement to stop it." Here, Dulles indirectly admitted that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which US imperialists have been touting, has not been successful. Dulles pitifully defended, "We have not reached the end of the road."

　　This Dulles, who attacked Hoover and advocated adhering to the bankrupt aggression policy of the Truman administration, was filled with pessimism, fear, and despair about the future of US imperialism and even the entire imperialist camp. He trembled and said: "There are still great dangers ahead," "We are facing a period that is bound to be of serious concern." He also despondently admitted that the current "major problem" of US imperialism is "whether Western civilization has become so old that it has to die and give way to a younger, more energetic society arising from Marxism." Dulles wailed helplessly, "In times of danger," "we should remain calm and resolute."

　　战争贩子们悲观、恐惧、绝望
    杜勒斯与胡佛争吵
    两人都供认现行侵略政策毫无前途
    【新华社六日讯】去年十二月二十九日，美国共和党首脑之一杜勒斯以美国国务卿高级顾问的身份在纽约发表外交政策演说，驳复共和党另一首脑胡佛的意见，力图为已经遭受可耻失败的杜鲁门政府现行侵略政策辩护。
    杜勒斯在其演说中认定胡佛提出的所谓“退出大陆”的侵略政策是同样毫无前途，他责难说：“这种理论是有缺点的。”他认为这种以“退出”来威胁不卖力的所谓“盟国”的办法，只能使帝国主义阵营更加分崩离析，从而使美国陷于更加孤立和崩溃的地位。杜勒斯辩称：“倘使一个国家在最危难的关头，将那些身受最大危险、因为庄严的条约、共同的传统以及战时平时的友谊而命运与共的盟国撇开不顾，那末，它以后就没有什么资格来为它自己选择什么国家了。”“拟定这样一个防御计划的心境，其本身就包含着自己崩溃的种子”。
    可是，杜勒斯又不能不承认杜鲁门政府现行的全盘侵略政策已经一败涂地和孕育着的严重危机。杜勒斯不得已地说：“我决不说我们国家在这种种方面所做的事情都是做得十全十美的”。在谈到美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略冒险时，杜勒斯无法掩饰：侵略军已经“遭受了严重的挫折”。杜勒斯承认马歇尔计划的破产说：“我们给予别人的贷款和赠予，有时可能发生了一点暂时的救济作用，而没有能够鼓励他们大胆地建立新的团结与力量。”他又说：“美国和联合国（应是美国操纵下的多数）可能都曾担当了它们尚无力量去支持的政治责任，政策……常常不能有效地及时地来执行。已发生了一些严重和或许是不必要的挫折。”他认为：“自由世界（按指帝国主义集团）的错误，在于太依赖潜在的力量，而不能建立足够的实际军事力量。”杜勒斯对帝国主义阵营内部特别是在军事行动上的步调不一致，深为伤心地说：“在涉及单纯的军事战略时，自由世界似乎时刻处在一种混乱的状态中，没有任何协议一致的加以拦挡的计划。”在这里，杜勒斯间接地承认了美帝国主义者所大肆吹嘘的北大西洋公约并未成功。杜勒斯可怜地辩解说：“我们还没有到达穷途末路一筹莫展的地步。”
    这个攻击胡佛和主张坚持已经破产了的杜鲁门政府侵略政策的杜勒斯，对美帝国主义乃至整个帝国主义阵营的前途，充满着悲观、恐惧和绝望的情绪。他战战兢兢地说：“前面仍有巨大危险”，“我们面对着一个势必是严重忧虑的时期”。他又颓丧地承认：美帝国主义现在的“重大问题”，是“西方文明是不是已变得这样老朽，以致不得不死去，而让位于从马克思主义产生出来的更年青的、精力充沛的社会”。杜勒斯在无可奈何中哀号“在危险的时刻”，“应该保持镇静、坚决”。
