　　Winter Production in Changzhi Region Achieves Results; Concrete Leadership Should Still be Strengthened to Overcome Imbalances
    [Our Newspaper] The winter production campaign in the Changzhi region of Shanxi province has achieved considerable success.

    Regarding fertilizer accumulation, as of now, Ping順(Ping Shun), Tun留(Tun Liu), Chang子(Chang Zi) counties have reached over 75% of their original targets. Li城(Li Cheng), Wu鄉(Wu Xiang), Lu城(Lu Cheng), Hu關(Hu Guan) counties have accumulated fertilizer averaging 70% of their original targets. Gao平(Gao Ping), Jin城(Jin Cheng), Qin水(Qin Shui) counties are relatively behind, reaching about 50% to 60%. The main reason for the success is the broad expansion of fertilizer sources and the unfolding of the fertilizer accumulation campaign.

    Regarding fuel preparation, each county originally planned to complete six months' worth of firewood or coal preparation during the winter. Currently, Lu城(Lu Cheng) has completed five months' worth of fuel, while Ping順(Ping Shun), Gao平(Gao Ping), Jin城(Jin Cheng), Chang子(Chang Zi) and other counties have completed about half (three months). In Hu關(Hu Guan) Fourth District, Da井(Da Jing) and six other villages have accumulated more than 250,000 baskets of coal. In Shuzhang Village, 104 animals hauled 3,640 cartloads of coal, and the entire village's coal accumulation is sufficient to burn until September 1951.

    Regarding the repair, construction, and purchase of agricultural tools, according to statistics from 330 villages in Ping順(Ping Shun), Gao平(Gao Ping), Li城(Li Cheng), Tun留(Tun Liu), Chang子(Chang Zi), Jin城(Jin Cheng), Xiang垣(Xiang Yuan), Qin水(Qin Shui) and other eight counties, a total of 20,925 agricultural tools have been repaired and constructed. In the increased purchase of agricultural tools, the most significant feature is the masses' interest in new-style agricultural tools. They are not only willing to buy them but also want to research, transform, and imitate them. In Xiang垣(Xiang Yuan) Changzhen Village, Chen Er'min and seven other mutual aid groups plan to make eight plow-shaped weeding hoes (new-style agricultural tools) and five double-legged drills (new-style agricultural tools).

    Regarding the adjustment of seeds and soil improvement, these two tasks have also attracted attention in some areas. Li城(Li Cheng) has formulated a seed adjustment plan. The "Bai Liusha" millet seed is the most popular among the masses in the county. Now 50,000 jin have been promoted, accounting for 33% of the county's millet planting area. In addition, 3,000 jin of Chinese Agricultural No. 4 millet seed have been organized for trial planting by specially invited farmers. Coupled with excellent varieties selected by labor models and the masses, Li城(Li Cheng) County can plant all excellent varieties in 1951. In Changzhi, Dongmiao and 18 other village societies have adjusted 35 shi of seeds for the masses. Xiang垣(Xiang Yuan) 28 villages adjusted 368 shi, 2 dou, and 2 sheng of seeds. Before the ground froze, many areas carried out soil improvement.

    Regarding the transportation industry, due to the brisk sales of iron, coal, and mountain specialties, the transportation industry has also greatly developed. According to statistics from Jin城(Jin Cheng) County and 128 villages in Xiang垣(Xiang Yuan), Ping順(Ping Shun), Gao平(Gao Ping) alone, 7,442 people participated in transportation labor, with 6,044 pack mules and 4,799 carts, earning a total of 4,667 shi and 5 dou of millet (excluding Jin城(Jin Cheng)).

    After the general inspection in December, the winter production campaign in the Changzhi region found that the tendency of some counties and districts to neglect winter production leadership has not been completely resolved. First, county and district leaders do not have a comprehensive grasp of winter production, which is reflected in the improper allocation of forces. For example, in Ping順(Ping Shun), Hu關(Hu Guan), and Changzhi counties, each district only retains three or two people to do production work, or even one person. This has led to an imbalance in the development of winter production. In Ling川(Ling Chuan), as of now, one-sixth of the villages have not been mobilized, and one-third of the villages lack leadership. In Lu城(Lu Cheng), villages lacking concrete leadership account for 60%, and about 10% of the villages are still completely in a state of laissez-faire. In Jin城(Jin Cheng) County, there are actually 178 cadres in the entire county, but only 30 people actually participate in leading winter production. The root cause of this problem is the lack of clarity in the guiding ideology for winter production. Second, the leadership of grassroots cadres is not tight enough, and the role of activists, especially labor models, is not fully utilized. Third, in some iron industry areas, due to the brisk sales of iron goods, most of their energy is concentrated on handicraft side occupations, and the preparation work for agriculture is very poor.

### 长治专区冬季生产获成绩  仍应加强具体领导克服不平衡现象

　　长治专区冬季生产获成绩
    仍应加强具体领导克服不平衡现象
    【本报讯】山西长治专区的冬季生产运动取得不少成绩。
    关于积肥方面，截至目前止，平顺、屯留、长子等县已达原要求的百分之七十五以上，黎城、武乡、潞城、壶关等县积肥平均达原要求的百分之七十，高平、晋城、沁水等县较差，约达百分之五十到六十。取得成绩的主要原因，是广泛地扩大肥源，展开了积肥运动。
    关于燃料准备方面，各县原计划冬季要求完成六个月的烧柴或烧煤的准备工作。目前潞城已完成五个月的燃料，其他平顺、高平、晋城、长子等县约完成半数（三个月）。壶关四区大井等六村已积煤二十五万多篓。树掌村一百零四头牲口拉煤三千六百四十车，全村积煤已能烧到一九五一年九月。
    关于修打增购农具方面，据平顺、高平、黎城、屯留、长子、晋城、襄垣、沁水等八县三百三十村统计，共修打农具两万零九百二十五件。在增购农具中，最大特点是群众对新式农具有了兴趣，不但愿意购买，而且要自己研究改造、仿造，襄垣长畛村陈二民等八个互助组，计划打犁形耘锄（新式农具）八张，双腿耧（新式农具）五张。
    关于调剂种籽和改良土壤方面，这两件工作也在部分地区引起了注意。黎城已作出调剂种籽计划，全县群众最喜爱的是“白流沙”谷种，现在已推广出五万斤，可达全县谷子播种面积的百分之三十三。另有华农四号谷种三千斤，已组织特约农户试种。加上劳动模范和群众自选的优良品种，该县一九五一年可以全部种上优良品种。长治东苗等十八村社已给群众调剂种籽三十五石。襄垣二十八村调剂种籽三百六十八石二斗二升。在未上冻前不少地区进行了土壤改造。
    关于运输事业，由于铁、煤和山货特产的畅销，运输业也大有发展。仅据晋城一个县及襄垣、平顺、高平一百二十八个村统计，参加运输劳力七千四百四十二人，驮骡六千零四十四头，车四千七百九十九辆，共赚小米（缺晋城）四千六百六十七石五斗。
    长治专区的冬季生产运动，经过十二月份的普遍检查后，发现不少县区忽视冬季生产领导的偏向并未完全解决。第一、县、区领导干部对冬季生产的全面掌握不够，这表现在力量上的配备不当，像平顺、壶关、长治等县，做生产工作的每区只留三两人，甚至一人。这样就形成了冬季生产发展的不平衡，陵川至现在还有六分之一的村庄没有动起来，三分之一村庄缺乏领导。潞城缺乏具体领导的村庄占百分之六十，有百分之十左右的村庄仍完全处于自流状态。晋城全县实有干部一百七十八人，实际参加领导冬季生产的只有三十人。产生这个问题的根本原因，是在领导思想上对冬季生产的工作方针不够明确。第二、是对基层干部领导抓的不紧，发挥积极分子的作用特别是劳动模范的作用不够。第三、是某些铁业地区，由于铁货畅销，大部精力集中在手工业副业等方面，对农业准备工作做的很差。
