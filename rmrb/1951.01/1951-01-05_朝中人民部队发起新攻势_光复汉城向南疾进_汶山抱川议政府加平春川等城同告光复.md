　　[Xinhua News Agency, Seoul Front, 4th] The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which launched a new offensive on the afternoon of December 31, 1950, recaptured Seoul, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at 12:00 noon on January 4. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army liberating Seoul were warmly welcomed by the people of Seoul. Seoul was first liberated on June 28, 1950, and captured by the American imperialist invading army on September 30 of the same year. During the three months that the American invading army occupied Seoul, the people of Seoul were subjected to cannibalistic and brutal massacres by the American invading army and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched a new offensive along the broad front in central Korea on New Year's Eve last year, and after quickly defeating the enemy's defense line and inflicting huge losses on the enemy, they liberated Seoul on January 4 this year. In addition to liberating Seoul, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also liberated Kaesong, Wensan, Baochuan, Uijeongbu and other cities north of Seoul, as well as Gapyeong, Chuncheon and other cities in central Korea during the offensive. The massive offensive of the People's Army and the Volunteer Army is developing southward. The American imperialist invading army and the Syngman Rhee bandit army are fleeing south.
