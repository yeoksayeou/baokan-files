Subject: Should Improve Leadership Over Shijingshan Power Plant

To the Editor:
　　
Over the past year, all employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant have achieved great success in ensuring electricity supply for the capital and accumulating wealth for the country. This is, of course, inseparable from the leadership of the State Electricity Administration, which directly leads the Shijingshan Power Plant. However, we feel that the State Electricity Administration's leadership over the Shijingshan Power Plant is not thorough enough, and even in some issues, there are quite serious bureaucratic and irresponsible attitudes. For example:
　　
　　1. Last July, the motor of the No. 5 generator's circulating water pump burned out. Because there were no spare parts, a motor twice the size had to be used as a replacement. Our plant applied to the General Administration for the purchase of cotton tape wire for repairing the motor in early August, but it was not bought until the end of September. However, the purchased wire was unusable and had to be returned to the General Administration. A month later, usable cotton tape wire was sent. The delay was two months in total. These two months not only affected safe power generation but also wasted 51,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity.
　　
　　2. Last June, we found that three porcelain bottles of the No. 4 generator's oil switch had cracks, one of which was particularly serious. This is a very serious hidden danger, and if it is not repaired, there is a risk of burning out the generator. At that time, there were no spare parts. After our plant's employees pieced together parts, they replaced the most severely damaged one with other porcelain bottles. Later, we immediately requested the General Administration to order replacements, but the Operations Department and the Supply Department of the General Administration obviously did not attach enough importance to such a serious problem. Although our plant repeatedly urged them, Comrade Liu Dezhen, the representative of our plant attending the National Congress of Laborers, Peasants and Soldiers, raised the issue again at the symposium of national labor model representatives held by the State Electricity Administration in October last year. The ordered porcelain bottles did not arrive until November last year, a delay of four months.
　　
　　3. Last June, the exciter core of the No. 6 generator burned out and had to be repaired; otherwise, without spare parts, there would be a great threat to the safety of the No. 6 unit. Although the employees worked hard to study and repair it, high-quality natural mica was needed to repair it. Last October, we applied to the General Administration for the purchase, but after a two-month delay, the reply was that it could not be bought. Why is it that in our vast, resource-rich, and mineral-abundant motherland, we cannot buy a few kilograms of natural mica? Last December, Chief Mao of the Operations Department of the General Administration came to our plant and said to the responsible comrades of our plant: "The General Administration is willing to do big things, and small things like buying mica are just a burden. No one is willing to put in the effort. In fact, this thing is available in Shandong. It is best if you send someone to buy it yourself, which is faster than the General Administration buying it." It turns out that they regard the issue related to the safety of Unit 6 as a "small matter." We know that all the employees of the power plant have always been very concerned and attentive to Unit 6; all the employees of the power plant regard Unit 6 of the power plant as "half the sky" of the power plant. But the Operations Department and the Supply Department of the General Administration are so unconcerned, inattentive, and irresponsible about the No. 6 generator, which is really astonishing.
　　
　　4. Last July, one of the main transformers of our plant burned out (it had only been repaired by the Engineering Department of the General Administration for half a year before it burned out again. The Engineering Department of the General Administration has also reviewed the poor repair quality). It was sent to the General Administration for repair in early August of the same year. Although our plant repeatedly urged them, it has not been repaired yet. Today they push it back a few days, and after a few days they say it will be done in a week. It has been pushed back like this until now. It has taken half a year to repair a transformer. Now, every time our plant is operating at high load, we have to be worried and cannot start one more pump or one more coal mill, which affects economic dispatch and safe operation. Spring is coming, and the new plant bus will be overhauled. If the transformer cannot be repaired recently, it will affect the overhaul of the new plant bus. We believe that the Engineering Department of the General Administration is not giving enough serious supervision and inspection to this issue.
　　
　　5. In May last year, the only insulation tester of the power plant that our plant entrusted to the General Administration for repair has not been heard from yet. In December last year, we entrusted the General Administration to calibrate the self-use electricity meters related to the plant's electricity consumption, but they have also disappeared without a trace.
　　
　　In addition, regarding the reward system to motivate employees' production enthusiasm, the General Administration recently ordered our plant that "all rewards in the future should be limited to those stipulated in the General Administration's reward methods, and the amount of bonuses and reward percentages must be submitted to the General Administration for approval." We believe that this will inevitably make rewards untimely, which will be detrimental to production. Moreover, with so many units, every reward, large or small, has to be approved by the General Administration. Can the General Administration approve them all?
　　
　　The employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant have opinions on the above-mentioned problems of the General Administration. Because these problems have brought undue losses to production, we hope that the responsible comrades of the General Administration should seriously pay attention to inspection and earnestly correct them.

### 电业管理总局  应改善对石景山发电厂的领导

    电业管理总局
    应改善对石景山发电厂的领导编辑同志：
    一年来，石景山发电厂的全体职工，在保证首都用电与为国家积累财富上，取得了很大的成绩。这当然是与石景山发电厂的直接领导者——电业管理总局的领导分不开的。但是我们觉得：电业管理总局对石景山发电厂的领导还不深入，甚至在某些问题上，还存在着相当严重的官僚主义与不负责任的态度。如：
    一、去年七月，五号发电机循环水泵马达烧了，因为没有预备品，不得不用大一倍的马达代替。我厂八月初就向总局申请购买修马达用的棉皮线，直到九月末才买来。但买来的又不能用，只好退回总局。过了一个月，才把能用的棉皮线送来。前后延误两个月。这两个月不仅影响了安全发电，还浪费了五万一千度电。
    二、去年六月我们检查出了四号发电机油开关有三个瓷瓶有裂痕，其中一个特别严重。这是很严重的隐形事故，不修好就有烧毁发电机的危险。当时没有预备品。经我厂职工东拼西凑，用别的瓷瓶换好了那个坏得最厉害的。后来即向总局请求订制，但总局运行处与供应处对于这样严重问题，显然是重视不够，虽经我厂一再催促，去年十月在电业总局招待全国劳动模范代表座谈会上，我厂出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表大会的代表刘德珍同志，曾对这个问题又提过意见，直到去年十一月订制的瓷瓶才来，拖了四个月之久。
    三、去年六月，六号发电机的励磁机心子烧毁了，必须修好；不然没有预备品，对六号机的安全是个很大的威胁。虽经过职工们努力钻研修理，但是必须有优良的天然云母才能修复。去年十月，我们就向总局申请购买，拖延了两个月后，答复说买不到。为什么我们这地大物博，矿产丰富的祖国，会买不到几公斤天然云母？去年十二月总局运行处毛处长到我厂，与我厂负责同志说：“总局愿意干大事，像买云母这小事只受累，作不出成绩来，大家都不愿意下工夫。其实这东西，山东就有，最好你们自己派人去买，倒比总局买快的多。”原来他们把有关六号机安全的问题，看成“小事”。我们知道发电厂的全体职工对六号机一向是非常关心和注意的；发电厂的全体职工是把发电厂的六号机看成电厂的“半个天”。但总局运行处与供应处竟对六号发电机这样的不关心，不注意和不负责任，实在令人惊异。
    四、去年七月我厂主要的一座变压器烧毁了（总局工程处才修好到半年就又烧毁了，总局工程处自己也检讨过修理质量不良），同年八月初就送总局修理，虽经我厂一再催促，但至今尚未修好。今天推过几天，过几天又说再过一个礼拜就行了，就这样一直推到现在，一台变压器，半年之久还没有修好。现在我厂每在高负荷运转时，就得提心吊胆，不能多开一台泵，多开一台磨煤机，以至影响了经济调度与安全运转。春天就要来了，新厂母线将进行检修。假使最近变压器不能修好，就会影响新厂母线的检修。这问题，我们认为总局工程处认真督促与检查是不够的。
    五、在去年五月，我厂委托总局修理的发电厂仅有的一具抵抗摇表，至今音信全无。去年十二月委托总局校正我厂对厂用电有关的自用电度表，也至今无踪影。
    此外，对于鼓动职工生产情绪的奖励制度，最近总局下令本厂，“今后所有奖励，均应以总局奖励办法中规定者为限，奖金数字及奖励百分率须提请总局核准”。我们认为这样一定会使奖励不及时，对生产会有损失的。再者这么多单位，每一大小奖励都要总局批准，总局是否能批得过来。
    石景山发电厂的职工们对总局上述问题是有意见的。因为这些问题都给生产带来不应有的损失，希望总局负责同志应该认真注意检查切实改正。
