    We visited the Red Army Museum in Moscow. The exhibits here evoked memories of the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War.

    In November 1942, the Hitler bandit gang stormed to the outskirts of Moscow, and the anniversary of the October Revolution was still held in Red Square. After participating in the review in front of Lenin's Mausoleum, the Red Army immediately set off for the front thirty kilometers away. The ferocious flames of fascism burned to the opposite bank of the Moscow Canal pier, and Hitler prepared red marble to build a mansion in Moscow. Dark clouds covered the sky, casting shadows over humanity's golden hope. It was at this moment that Stalin, in a firm and calm voice, told the Red Army, all of the Soviet Union, and the whole world: "We can not only liberate our motherland, but also liberate other countries."

    The words of the great Stalin were completely realized, and the brave and battle-tested Red Army carried out his orders and realized his predictions.

    Recalling these past events, we visited the various exhibition halls of the Red Army Museum with respect and gratitude. Here are displayed pictures, sculptures, weapons, trophies, portraits and relics of martyrs, as well as various records of great historical value, documenting the Red Army's achievements. From these textual and pictorial records, we learned that Odessa held out for sixty-nine days, Sevastopol defended for two hundred and fifty days, Leningrad and Stalingrad never fell, and the Battle of Moscow became the initial key to turning the tide of the war.

    Here is also displayed the Leningrad entry permit issued by Hitler, revealing Hitler's insane delusions. The interpreter told us that Hitler had pre-appointed a major general to serve as the garrison commander of Leningrad. This major general finally entered Leningrad, but did not become the garrison commander, but became a prisoner. What were the feelings of this "garrison commander" when he walked into the Leningrad prisoner-of-war camp?

    Hitler's preparations for entering Moscow were even more thorough. He prepared to hold a victory parade in Red Square, bringing with him the musical instruments for the parade and a car full of Iron Crosses, which he was going to award to meritorious generals in Moscow. The result, as everyone knows, was that these "meritorious" generals received another kind of cross, the one stuck in front of their graves.

    Now, a whole car of Iron Crosses and a whole set of musical instruments are displayed here. Next to them are displayed paper clothes and straw sandals. The Hitler bandit gang planned to invade Moscow in September 1942. By the time they scurried to the outskirts of Moscow, it was already November. In the deep snow outside Moscow, the bandits were still wearing summer clothes: paper clothes and straw sandals.

    The Nazis'妄想 (wàngxiǎng: delusion, fantasy) met the Red Army's bayonets and were shattered to pieces. Starting from the outskirts of Moscow, through the Battle of Stalingrad, the Red Army turned the tide of the war and maintained the initiative until it took Berlin, eliminated the Nazis, and saved Europe and the civilization of the world.

    The Red Army Museum is a museum of victory.

    However, the victory of the Soviet Union, like our country's War of Liberation, was not easily won. It was won by countless heroes, in the air and on the ground, through fearless combat. The museum has a model of a plane ramming the tail of an enemy plane. This was a gift from an artist to the 11th All-Soviet Youth Congress. The silver metal model represents the heroic story of Major Kheltonov. On the sixth day of the war, in an air battle, the major rammed his plane into the tail of an enemy plane. The enemy plane was destroyed and crashed, while he himself safely flew back to the airport. This act not only required extraordinary courage, but also a high degree of skill. In order to seek further study, Major Kheltonov is still studying at the Soviet Aviation University.

    Another Soviet air warrior, named Kozhedub, participated in the Battle of Berlin. He participated in 120 air battles, shot down 62 enemy planes, and was never injured. He was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union three times, and his photos and deeds are also displayed here.

    More heroes emerged in the Red Army's ground forces. A girl raised in Moscow used a gun given to her by a worker friend to eliminate 305 enemies. This gun is now on display in the museum. Here is also another gun, which was used by three people in rotation, and they used it to eliminate 1,000 enemies. In Stalingrad, there was a four-story building that Pavlov and his eighteen comrades stood firm and defended for thirty days in the face of Nazi bombing, shelling, and assaults. This building is now called Pavlov's House, and the museum displays a model of this building.

    Here, we saw a large oil painting of the Battle of Berlin. Hitler threw 500,000 troops into the defense of his last lair. The Red Army defeated the German invaders' defenses and occupied Berlin. The Nazis' death throes were extremely frantic. The fighting was extremely fierce, as shown in the color film "The Fall of Berlin." When the Red Army rushed to the German Reichstag building, the bandits were still stubbornly resisting. But the Red Army soldiers, nearing their final victory, were clearly full of joy. One soldier happily wrote on the wall of the Reichstag in chalk: "Ivan from Russia was here."

    As shown in "The Fall of Berlin," while the fighting was raging inside and outside the Reichstag building, two brave Red Army soldiers, braving the rain of bullets, hoisted the victory flag on the dome of the building, a symbol of final victory. These two heroes were named Kantaria and Yegorov. Pictures of the two friends are preserved in the museum. Now they have returned to their hometowns. Kantaria is a shock worker team leader on a collective farm, and Yegorov is the chairman of a collective farm.

    The museum displays many relics, photos, sculptures, and clothes of martyrs. The photo of the world-renowned Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya being hanged immediately caught our attention. Everyone silently gazed at the portrait of this captured hero who was loyal and unyielding. This photo was found on a dead fascist officer. Here is also another photo of Zoya's body. Three weeks after Zoya was killed, the Red Army recovered the place where she was martyred. Her remains were still in the snow there. The Red Army brushed away the snow and took a photo, which is her last image. Here is also a portrait of Zoya painted by a French painter living in Shanghai. This determined girl was martyred for human civilization, so her glorious name has long transcended the borders of the Soviet Union.

    In a glass case, we saw the party membership card of an alternate member of the All-Union Communist Party. This belonged to a heroic tank driver. He sacrificed himself, and his comrades sent a corner of his destroyed alternate party membership card to Moscow, where it is displayed here.

    Another tank driver was seriously injured. Before his death, he wrote in blood on the tank: "I am dying now, but my Party remains." The words written in blood expressed his infinite loyalty to the Party. His loyalty will be a model for all Communist Party members.

    In the Soviet film "The Great Turning Point," there is such a story: the driver of a general's car sees his superior in the shelter, anxious and unable to eat, because the telephone line is down. This is when the battle has reached a critical point. Failure to get through on the phone and the inability to command will lead to defeat. The driver thinks for a moment and volunteers to crawl out of the shelter. In the freezing cold, his hands are blown apart, but he still struggles forward, crawling to where the telephone line is broken. Because his hands are destroyed, he has to bite the two ends of the broken line in his mouth and connect them together. The phone line is reconnected, but the electric current travels through his body and burns him to death. This is a true story. The heroic victim's name was Bukilov, but his position was not a driver, but a telegraph operator. Bukilov's glorious name and his deeds, represented here by a model, are also preserved in the museum.

    During the war, a soldier named Matrosov saw that a machine gun in an enemy bunker was blocking the Red Army's advance, killing many comrades. Matrosov ran to the gun emplacement of the bunker and blocked the gun muzzle with his body. He sacrificed himself, but his comrades broke through the machine gun blockade and won the victory in this battle.

    This story is depicted in the film "Private Ivan." In the Red Army Museum, there is a model of that machine gun position sculpted by an artist. Under the light of the lamp, we seem to see Matrosov's incomparably sublime and fearless heroic posture.

    Among the souvenirs, we also saw many relics of sacrificed generals. We saw a general's uniform with red cloth edging the collar. This is the relic of General Panfilov. He sacrificed himself on the second day of the Battle of Moscow. Looking at his uniform, people can roughly imagine his height, as if he were still alive.

    Here are also many souvenirs of General Chernyakhovsky. The general was killed in the attack on East Prussia. He was twice awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and received eleven orders. Here are his leather-collared overcoat and his party membership card. The card says his age: thirty-nine years old.

    A bronze statue of the world-renowned Soviet general Vatutin stands in an exhibition room of the museum. He was the commander of the First Ukrainian Front of the Red Army. He rose from soldier to general and had twenty-four years of military service. This battle-tested general, who came from the ranks, was unfortunately killed when he fought to Kiev. The troops he led were an invincible iron army. They participated in the Battle of Stalingrad, liberated Ukraine, and recovered Kiev. After his death, his victorious army, under the command of another general, advanced into Berlin.

    The museum displays many flags: victorious red flags, and also flags of surrender from the German invaders. The most prominent of the red flags is the regimental flag of a Ukrainian regiment of the Red Army. This regiment sacrificed all of its members while pursuing the enemy, and the regimental flag was seized. Later, this group of Nazi bandits was completely annihilated by the Red Army, and the regimental flag was wrapped around a Nazi officer's body. The Red Army confiscated it and inserted it in this museum. The bright red flag reminds people of the bloodstains of the officers and soldiers of the entire regiment who heroically sacrificed themselves on Soviet land.

    There are many things to recall in the grand and solemn Red Army Museum. The exhibits here fully demonstrate the unparalleled power of the Red Army, allowing people to look at them and increase their confidence in infinite victory. The museum also extensively collects various mementos of fallen commanders and fighters. These items are displayed here, which will arouse people's infinite recollection and admiration for the martyrs.

　　莫斯科红军博物馆
    周立波
    我们参观了莫斯科的红军博物馆。这里的陈列品，引起了我们对于苏联伟大的卫国战争的回忆。
    一九四二年十一月，希特勒匪帮冲到了莫斯科近郊，红场照旧举行十月革命的纪念。红军参加了列宁墓前的检阅以后；立即开赴三十公里以外的前方。法西斯的凶焰烧到了莫斯科运河的码头的对岸，希特勒准备了到莫斯科修盖公馆的红色大理石。阴云蒙蔽着天空，在人类的金色的希望之上投下了暗影。就在这时候，斯大林用坚定的，平静的声音告诉红军，告诉全苏联，告诉全世界：“我们不但可以解放我们的祖国，而且可以解放其他的国家。”
    伟大的斯大林的话完全实现了，骁勇善战的红军执行了他的命令，实现了他的预言。
    想起了这些往事，我们怀着尊敬和感激的情感，瞻仰红军博物馆的各个陈列室。这里摆着红军战绩的图片、雕刻、兵器、战利品、烈士们的遗相和遗物，以及各种有着重大历史价值的记录。从这些文字和图片的记录里，我们知道敖得萨坚守了六十九天，塞发斯托波尔保卫了二百五十天，列宁格勒和斯大林格勒一直没有沦陷过，而莫斯科的大会战成为了最初的扭转战局的关键。
    这里也摆着希特勒颁布的列宁格勒进城证，显露了希特勒的疯狂的妄想。解说的人告诉我们说：希特勒预先任命了一个少将担任列宁格勒的卫戍司令，这位少将终于进了列宁城，但没有做卫戍司令，却当了俘虏。这位“卫戍司令”，走进列宁格勒的俘虏营的时候，不知道有什么感想？
    希特勒进莫斯科的准备，作得更周到。他准备在红场举行胜利的检阅，他带来了检阅时用的乐器，还有装满一汽车的十字勋章，那是他要在莫斯科奖给有功将领的。而结果是大家知道的：这些“有功”将领得到了另外一种十字章，就是插在他们坟墓之前的十字架。
    现在，一整车的十字勋章和一整套的乐器，都摆在这里。它们的旁边陈列着纸衣和草鞋。希特勒匪帮是打算在一九四二年九月里打进莫斯科来的，他们窜到莫斯科近郊的时候，已经是十一月了，在莫斯科郊外的深雪里，匪徒们还穿着夏天的衣着：纸衣和草鞋。
    纳粹的妄想碰在红军的枪尖上，碰得稀碎了。从莫斯科近郊起，经过斯大林格勒大会战，红军扭转了战局，以后一直掌握着主动，直到把柏林拿下，把纳粹消灭，拯救了欧洲以及世界的文明。
    红军博物馆就是一座胜利博物馆。
    但是，苏联的胜利和我国的解放战争一样，不是容易得来的，是无数的英雄，在空中，在地上，用无畏的战斗换来的。博物馆有一个用自己飞机冲碰敌机机尾的模型。这是一个艺术家送给全苏第十一届青年代表大会的礼物。银色的金属的模型表现着赫利顿夫少校的英勇的故事。这位少校在开战后的第六天，在一次空战中，用自己的飞机向敌机的机尾冲去，敌机被冲毁落地，而他自己却安然飞回了机场。这种行为不仅要有非凡的勇敢，而且要有高度的技术，为了更求深造，这位赫利顿夫少校现在还在苏联航空大学里学习。
    苏联另外一位空中的勇士，名叫阔日杜布。他曾参加攻占柏林的战役。他曾参加一百二十次空战，打落六十二架敌机，自己没有受过一次伤。他获得了三次苏联英雄章，他的相片和事绩也陈列在这里。
    红军的地面部队出现了更多的英雄。有一位莫斯科教养出来的姑娘，用她一位工人朋友送给她的枪，消灭了三百零五个敌人。这枝枪现在摆在这博物馆里。这里也摆着另外一枝枪，它曾供三个人替换着使用，他们用它消灭了一千个敌人。在斯大林格勒，有一座四层楼房，巴夫洛夫和他的十八个战友在纳粹的轰炸、炮击和猛扑之下，屹立不动地整整守卫了三十天。这座房子，现在叫作巴夫洛夫楼，博物馆里陈列了这座楼房的模型。
    在这里，我们看见了柏林会战的一幅大油画，希特勒在他的最后巢穴的保卫战里，投入了五十万军队。红军击溃了德寇的防御，攻占了柏林。纳粹的垂死挣扎是疯狂之极的。战斗无比的激烈，正如五彩电影《攻克柏林》里所表现的，红军冲到德国国会大楼时，匪徒们还在顽强的抵抗。但是红军战士们在接近最后胜利的时候，显然是满怀欢快，有一位战士，用粉笔在国会大楼的墙上愉快的写道：“俄国的伊凡，到了这里了。”
    正如《攻克柏林》里面所表现的，当战斗正在国会大楼的里里外外激烈进行的时候，红军的两个勇敢的战士，冒着弹雨，把胜利的红旗插上了大楼的圆顶，这是最后胜利的象征。这两位英雄，一个名叫康德利亚，一个叫做意哥洛夫。两位朋友的像片都保存在博物馆里。现在他们回到了自己的乡下，康德利亚作了集体农场的突击队长，意哥洛夫当了集体农场的主席。
    博物馆里陈列了许许多多烈士的遗物，照片，雕刻和衣服。世界驰名的丹娘被绞死时的照片立刻引起了我们的注意。大家在这位被俘之后忠贞不屈的英雄的遗照之前肃静的凝望了一会。这帧照片是在一个被击毙了的法西斯军官身上搜出来的。这里也陈列了丹娘尸体的另一张照片。丹娘遇难以后三星期，红军收复了她殉难的地方，她的遗体还留在那儿的雪里，红军拨开积雪，拍了一张照片，这是她的最后的遗影。这里也挂着一位住在上海的法国画家所作的丹娘的肖像画。这位刚毅的姑娘是为了人类文明殉节的，因此她的荣名早就超越了苏联的国界。
    在一个玻璃框里，我们看见了联共的一个候补党员的党证。这是属于一个英勇的坦克手的。他牺牲了，他的战友把他的炸毁的候补党证的一角，送上莫斯科，陈列在这里。
    另外一个坦克手，受了重伤，他在临终以前，用自己的血在坦克上写道：“我现在死了，但是我的党还在。”血写的话，表示了他对党的无限的忠心。他的精忠，将是一切共产党员的典范。
    在苏联的电影《大转变》里，有这样的故事：一位将军的汽车司机，在掩蔽部里看见他的上司因为电话打不通，正在焦虑不安，饭都吃不下；这正是战斗进行到万分危急的时候，打不通电话，指挥不灵，就会招致失败的。司机想了一下，就自告奋勇的爬出掩蔽部，在冰天雪地里，他的双手被炸坏，但他还是挣扎往前爬，爬到电话线断了的地方，因为手已炸坏，只得把断线的两端咬在嘴里，接连在一起。电话打通了，但是电流传到他身上，把他烧死了。这是真事，这位英勇的牺牲者名叫布基洛夫，不过他的职务不是司机，而是电报员。布基洛夫的英名和这里用模型表现出来的他的事迹，也保存在博物馆里。
    在战争中，有一个名叫马特洛索夫的战士，看见敌人地堡里的一挺机枪挡住了红军前进的道路，杀伤了很多的同志，马特洛索夫跑到这座地堡的枪眼之前，用自己的身体把枪口塞住，他牺牲了，而他的战友却冲过了机枪的封锁口，取得了这次战斗的胜利。
    这个故事表现在电影《普通一兵》里。在这红军博物馆，摆着一个美术家塑造的那个机枪阵地的模型，在电灯照耀之下，我们好像看到了马特洛索夫无比崇高的无畏的雄姿。
    在纪念品中，我们也看到了许多牺牲了的将领的遗物。我们看见了一件领角镶着红布的将军的制服，这是巴菲洛夫将军的遗物。他在莫斯科会战的第二天就牺牲了。人们看着他的制服，可以约略的想见他的身量，好像他还活着一样。
    这里也摆着车尔尼哈夫斯基上将的许多纪念品。上将是在攻打东普鲁士时牺牲的，他曾两次荣受苏联英雄的称号，得过十一次勋章。这里摆着他的皮领大衣和他的党证，党证上写着他的年纪：三十九岁。
    举世闻名的苏联名将瓦图丁将军的铜像屹立在博物馆的一个展览室里。他是红军乌克兰第一战线的统帅，他从战士升到了将军，军龄有二十四年。这位战士出身的身经百战的名将，打到基辅的时候不幸阵亡了。他所率领的部队是一支战无不胜的铁军，他们参加了斯大林格勒大会战，解放了乌克兰，收复了基辅。在他死后，他的这支常胜军在另外一位将军率领之下，攻进了柏林。
    博物馆里陈列着许许多多的旗子：有胜利的红旗，也有德寇的降旗。红旗之中最特出的一面，是红军一个乌克兰团的团旗。这个团在追击敌人时，全部牺牲了，团旗被缴去。后来，这股纳粹匪徒被红军全部消灭了，这面团旗围在一个纳粹军官的身上，红军把它缴回来，插在这博物馆里。鲜红的旗子使人想起全团壮烈牺牲的官兵洒在苏维埃土地上的斑斑的血迹。
    宏大而庄严的红军博物馆值得追怀的地方是非常之多的。这里的陈列品，充分的表现了红军的无比的威力，使人们看着，能够增加无限胜利的信心。博物馆也广泛地收集了阵亡的指战员们的种种纪念物，这些物品陈列在这里，会引起人们对于先烈的无限追怀和景仰。
                                    一九五一年一月，北京。
