Xinhua News Agency: Northeast China - Various propaganda departments in Northeast China have recently summarized their experiences in timely affairs propaganda work over the past two months, strengthened the organization and leadership of propaganda work, and stipulated several necessary systems to ensure that this work can be carried out regularly and in depth. The Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened a provincial propaganda work conference to discuss the working principles of making timely affairs propaganda in-depth and regular. Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, has now organized a 30-member propaganda team headed by the Secretary of the CPC Municipal Committee to specifically lead the city's timely affairs propaganda. The Propaganda Department of the CPC Jilin Municipal Committee has also established a weekly timely affairs lecture system to answer various difficult questions in timely affairs study. In addition, the Jilin Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have hired ten timely affairs lecturers to regularly explain timely affairs to workers throughout the city. Most counties, banners, districts, and villages in Rehe Province have also established timely affairs propaganda committees.

In the process of transitioning to regular timely affairs propaganda, all localities first started with the establishment and consolidation of propagandists. Qiqihar City, Hailun, Suihua, and other counties in Heilongjiang Province have reviewed the work of propagandists and re-established the propaganda network based on summarizing past experiences in timely affairs propaganda. At present, cities and 30 counties in the province have more than 34,000 propagandists. More than 2,000 propagandists in Harbin City, under the leadership of the CPC Harbin Municipal Committee, have been reorganized and now devote one or two days of their spare time each week to go into the public to promote major political events and solve specific ideological problems among the masses. Jianchang County in Rehe Province has established a propaganda network with 1,800 propagandists and has launched propaganda work. All localities have also paid attention to the training, cultivation, and adjustment of propagandists, thus continuously improving the quality of propagandists.

The method of carrying out timely affairs education through extensive mass learning organizations is also commonly adopted in various localities. Workers' spare-time schools in various localities, with 360,000 workers, have now added timely affairs political education to their literacy studies. Timely affairs education is also conducted in rural winter schools in various localities. The 200,000 winter school students in Rehe Province have generally adopted the method of learning and publicizing at any time, which has been very effective. Short-term training courses for rural district and village cadres in various localities also regard in-depth timely affairs education, clarification of thinking, and enhancement of fighting spirit as important educational content. In addition, various localities have also organized a large number of reading groups. Changchun City has established 151 reading groups from the beginning of November last year to the present. More than 1,400 reading groups have also been established in rural areas, factories, schools, cooperatives, and other places in Heilongjiang Province.

The experience of various localities in carrying out timely affairs propaganda campaigns in the past two months has proved that constantly enriching the content of propaganda with the development of the situation and carrying out propaganda in combination with various central tasks are important methods for deepening and regularizing timely affairs propaganda. At the same time, conducting vigorous timely affairs propaganda at any time is also an important method for mobilizing the masses to actively participate in various tasks. More than 300 propagandists in Beijing District, Andong County, deeply publicized the news of the liberation of Pyongyang to various villages and put forward the slogan "Celebrate Victory with Practical Actions," which promoted the peasants of Guojia Village in the district to complete the payment of more than 110,000 catties of public grain, which was originally scheduled to be completed in five days, in one day. When the Shangzhi County People's Government in Songjiang Province convened a people's representative meeting to deploy the public grain task, the Secretary of the CPC County Committee first reported to everyone the conspiracy of the United States to expand its war of aggression against Korea, which stimulated everyone's patriotic enthusiasm and played a great role in ensuring the completion of the public grain task.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 16th - The movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country has been widely launched in small and medium-sized cities in Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces.

Since November last year, organs, schools, factories, and people's organizations in small and medium-sized cities in Guangdong Province have conducted timely affairs study and conveyed the current situation through conferences such as people's representatives conferences and peasant representatives conferences. Various localities have made full use of blackboard newspapers, forums, and cultural and artistic activities to carry out timely affairs propaganda to the broad masses of the people. In many cities and larger market towns, people from all walks of life have successively held mass rallies and demonstrations to resist America, aid Korea, and celebrate victory. On the basis of the improvement of the political consciousness of the masses at all levels, the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country has been carried out in depth in combination with various practical tasks. Workers have enthusiastically launched patriotic production competition movements. Workers at sugar factories in Shunde and Dongguan have created the highest records for sugar purity. Workers in various industries such as postal and telecommunications, electricity, textiles, and transportation in many cities such as Shaoguan, Xingning, Foshan, Jiangmen, and Zhanjiang have launched patriotic production competitions. 11,000 young students from various localities have signed up to participate in military cadre schools. Business and industrial circles in more than ten cities including Shantou, Foshan, Shaoguan, and Jiangmen have held rallies and demonstrations to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country, and have formulated patriotic covenants. Industrial and commercial operators in various cities and towns have expressed their patriotic enthusiasm with practical actions of actively paying taxes. More than 4,000 industrial and commercial households in Chaoyang County held a demonstration on New Year's Eve and completed 94% of the total task of industrial and commercial tax on the same day. The tax paid by the industrial and commercial circles in Yangjiang County in five days reached 93% of the task. The industrial and commercial circles in Chikan Town, Kaiping County, completed 90% of the tax in one day. The consolation movement for Chinese and Korean people's soldiers has also been enthusiastically launched in various localities. The "Thousand Yuan Movement" launched by the industrial and commercial circles in Shiqi City and the "Ten Thousand Yuan Movement" launched by the industrial and commercial circles in Taishan County have been enthusiastically responded to by all walks of life. The "Thousand Yuan Movement" in Shiqi City raised more than 8.35 million yuan in Renminbi at the mobilization meeting. Many workers and teachers also saved money and donated it to console Chinese and Korean people's soldiers.

On January 12, nearly 30,000 people from industrial and commercial circles in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, held a grand parade to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. The parade included an elderly group composed of more than 90 seniors from the city's industrial and commercial circles. Shen Qintang and Tu Chuncheng, who are 70 years old, persisted to the end with the parade in the cold wind. The parade also issued a patriotic declaration, calling on the industrial and commercial circles of Jiangxi Province to expand the collection of donations to console the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers, and earnestly assist the people's government in investigating and controlling all American property in Jiangxi Province. Industrial and commercial circles in small and medium-sized cities such as Jiujiang, Ganzhou, and Poyang in the province have also successively held forums and representatives' meetings to denounce the past economic plunder of Jiangxi Province by American imperialism. Industrial and commercial circles in various localities have also formulated patriotic covenants.

　　东北各地时事宣传逐步深入
    建立和整理宣传员网使宣传工作转入经常化
    广东江西两省中小城市普遍进行时事宣传
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：东北各地宣传部门最近总结了两月来时事宣传工作的经验，并加强了对宣传工作的组织和领导，规定了若干必要制度以保证这一工作得以经常和深入地进行。中共黑龙江省委宣传部曾召开全省宣传工作会议，讨论了使时事宣传深入和经常化的工作方针。该省齐齐哈尔市现已组织了以中共市委书记为首的三十人的宣传团，专门领导全市的时事宣传。中共吉林市委宣传部还建立了每周一次的时事讲座制，解答时事学习中的各种疑难问题。此外该市人民政府和市总工会等单位则聘请了十名时事讲师，定期给全市工人讲解时事。热河省大部分县、旗和区、村也都建立了时事宣传委员会。
    各地在转入经常性的时事宣传过程中，均首先从建立和整理宣传员着手。黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市与海伦、绥化等县已从总结过去的时事宣传经验中，检查了宣传员的工作情况，重新建立了宣传网。现该省各城市与三十个县已有三万四千余名宣传员。哈尔滨市的两千余名宣传员，在中共哈尔滨市委领导下加以整顿后，每周抽出一、两天业余时间深入市民中宣传重大政治事件和解决群众中的具体思想问题。热河省建昌县已经建立拥有一千八百名宣传员的宣传网，并已展开宣传工作。各地对于宣传员的训练、培养和调整也很注意，因而使宣传员的质量不断提高。
    通过广泛的群众性的学习组织，展开时事教育的方法亦为各地普遍采用。拥有三十六万工人的各地工人业余学校，现在都已结合识字学习增加了时事政治教育的内容。各地农村冬学也都进行时事教育。热河省的二十万冬学学员普遍采取了随时学随时宣传的方法，收效很大。各地农村区村干部短期轮训班也把深入进行时事教育、澄清思想、提高斗志作为重要的教育内容。此外，各地并大量组织了读报组。长春市从去年十一月初至目前为止已建立了一百五十一个读报组。黑龙江省各地农村、工厂、学校、合作社等也建立了读报组一千四百多个。
    两个月来各地开展时事宣传运动的经验，证明了随着形势发展不断充实宣传内容，以及结合各项中心工作进行宣传，是时事宣传深入和经常化的重要方法。同时，随时进行有力的时事宣传，也是动员群众积极参加各项工作的重要方法。安东县北井区三百多名宣传员，把解放平壤的消息深入宣传到各村，并提出“以实际行动庆祝胜利”的口号，推动了该区郭家村农民在一天内就将原定五天送完的十一万余斤公粮全部缴纳完毕。松江省尚志县人民政府在召开人民代表会议布置公粮任务时，首先由中共县委书记向大家报告了美国扩大侵朝战争的阴谋，激发了大家的爱国热情，对保证完成公粮任务也起了很大作用。
    【新华社汉口十六日电】抗美援朝保家卫国运动已在广东和江西两省各中小城市中广泛展开。
    广东省各中小城市的机关、学校、工厂和各人民团体均于去年十一月开始进行了时事学习，并通过各界人民代表会、农民代表会等会议传达了当前形势。各地充分运用黑板报、座谈会、文艺活动等方式向广大人民进行了时事宣传。在许多城市和较大集镇中，各界人民都先后举行了抗美援朝和庆祝胜利的群众集会和示威游行。在各阶层群众政治觉悟提高的基础上，抗美援朝运动即结合各项实际工作深入展开。工人们热烈掀起爱国生产竞赛运动。顺德、东莞糖厂工人都创造了煮糖纯度的最高纪录。韶关、兴宁、佛山、江门、湛江等许多城市的邮电、电力、纺织、运输等各业工人都展开了爱国主义生产竞赛。各地青年学生报名参加军事干部学校的达一万一千人。汕头、佛山、韶关、江门等十余城市的工商界都举行了抗美援朝保家卫国的集会和示威游行，并订定了爱国公约。各城镇工商业者以踊跃纳税的实际行动来表现爱国的热诚。潮阳县四千余工商户于除夕举行了示威游行，当天即完纳工商税总任务的百分之九十四。阳江县工商界在五天内缴纳的税款即达任务的百分之九十三。开平县赤坎镇工商界在一天时间完税百分之九十。对中朝人民战士的慰劳运动亦在各地热烈展开。石歧市工商界发动的“千元运动”，台山县工商界的“万元运动”，都获得各界热烈响应。石歧市的“千元运动”，在动员会上即捐得人民币八百三十五万余元。许多工人和教师也进行节约，捐献慰劳中朝人民战士。
    江西省南昌市工商界近三万人于一月十二日举行了抗美援朝保家卫国大游行。游行队伍中有该市工商界耆老九十余人组成的老人团，七十高龄的沈钦堂、涂纯诚等都在寒风凛冽中随游行队伍坚持到底。游行队伍并发出爱国宣言，号召江西全省工商界扩大征集捐献慰劳代金，慰劳中朝人民战士。认真协助人民政府清查管制美国在江西省内的一切财产。该省九江、赣州、鄱阳等中小城市工商界，亦先后召开了座谈会、代表会，控诉美帝国主义过去对江西省的经济掠夺。各地工商界并纷纷订立爱国公约。
