Comrades:

The First Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives has already approved the supply and marketing business plan for the first quarter of 1951. This plan mainly includes the following three aspects: (1) Exchange of goods between the three major administrative regions of East China, North China, and Northeast China. (2) Typical rationing plan for three million cooperative members. (3) Credit purchases.

Later, we also organized the exchange of goods in the five provinces of North China, which also became part of the plan for the first quarter of 1951.

The total trade and procurement figures for the first quarter of 1951 are even larger than these four items. This plan does not include all the figures, but it does cover the main ones. In particular, it covers several forms of supply and marketing operations.

Now, I will talk about the key points of several business plans:

            (1) Exchange of Goods between the Three Major Regions

The purpose of exchanging goods between the three major regions is to solve part of the needs of cooperative members in North China, East China, and Northeast China. Cooperative members in Northeast China need cotton and cloth. To buy cotton and cloth, they need to sell their grain and bean cakes. North China and East China can supply Northeast China with cotton, cloth, and some local products in exchange for the grain and bean cakes they need from Northeast China. To solve this mutual need, the National Federation of Cooperatives organized the exchange of industrial products and agricultural and sideline products between these three major regions to promote the sale of some grain and bean cakes from cooperative members in Northeast China and supply them with urgently needed cloth and cotton; to promote the sale of some local products and industrial products from cooperative members in North China and East China, to solve their grain shortage difficulties, and to prepare the fertilizer needed for the spring of 1951. This exchange is an important method to reduce intermediate circulation links.

In the past, such exchange of goods between cooperatives has been constantly carried out at various levels of cooperatives, and some problems have been solved. However, the idea of viewing this as upper-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives, and the practice of upper-level cooperatives regularly and systematically organizing such exchanges, has not been widely valued by general cooperatives. Therefore, it has not been possible to greatly invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas to meet the supply and marketing requirements of lower-level cooperatives and cooperative members.

This time, the exchange of goods between the three major regions is organized and planned under the leadership of the National Federation of Cooperatives. This is the first nationwide exchange of goods. The National Federation of Cooperatives lacks experience in organizing such large-scale exchanges of goods, but we hope to do this work well and make a good start. Therefore, in principle, we require that the types of goods exchanged should be few, the quantities should be small, the quality should be good, and the prices should be low. The recipients of the goods we sell are cooperative members. If the goods are good and the prices are cheap, the other party will be satisfied, and the second and third exchanges will be easier to do. If the goods are not good and the prices are high, it will be difficult to carry out future exchanges. Therefore, adhering to these principles is not only the task of the National Federation of Cooperatives, but also the task of cooperatives at all levels and even cooperative members.

From December 1950 to June 1951, the total quantity of major goods exchanged is as follows:

Northeast Region to North China and East China: 100,000 tons of bean cake, 100,000 tons of soybeans, 100,000 tons of corn and sorghum;

North China and East China to Northeast China: 2 million catties of lint cotton, 600,000 bolts of various cloths.

The National Federation of Cooperatives did not organize the exchange of other items in smaller quantities, such as sunflower seeds, raw materials (bamboo branches), and knitwear, which were contracted separately by the major regions.

This exchange of goods is needed by everyone, but in practice, we also encountered some difficulties. The first is the issue of management thinking. After the July meeting, there was a basic consensus on opposing capitalist management thinking, but this ideological consensus has not been fully reflected in business operations. At the beginning of negotiating the contracts, the capitalist management thinking of each region, which proposed to promote products not based on the needs of cooperative members, but on the needs of the region, was exposed and criticized. Due to the failure to thoroughly transform the capitalist thinking of doing free market trade and buying and selling in the past, and the lack of a full determination to serve cooperative members, precise statistical figures could not be provided for the prices, packaging, transportation, and losses of goods when drawing up contracts and calculating detailed accounts, and there were also no statistical or reliable figures for the needs of cooperative members. In addition, the cooperative societies in major administrative regions did not dare to sign contracts due to concerns about fluctuating prices and changed to signing agreements. To enable this agreement to be signed, the National Federation of Cooperatives assumed the responsibility of adjusting prices in the event of price fluctuations, because the price differences between the regions were relatively large. After carefully calculating the reasonable profits and reasonable expenses, the total amount of regional price differences was quite large. Everyone agreed that this amount should be controlled by the National Federation of Cooperatives so that it could be adjusted in the event of price fluctuations. Finally, after leaving out a part for the basic construction of the National Federation of Cooperatives, the surplus will be returned to each region.

In this contract signing, it can be seen that when the exchange of goods between regions is needed on the one hand, but not immediately needed on the other hand, especially when the profit on one side is not guaranteed, although both sides urgently need to exchange goods, it is difficult to sign a larger contract for the exchange of goods without the upper-level cooperatives being responsible for organizing it. For example, Northeast China urgently needs cotton cloth, which can be supplied by East China and North China; and the bean cakes of Northeast China are needed by East China and North China, but they are only needed during the spring plowing in 1951. If they are transported immediately, it will inevitably lead to the accumulation of funds. Therefore, mutual parties cannot directly sign contracts and must be organized by the National Federation of Cooperatives, which will advance a batch of money to transport the bean cakes from Northeast China and supply them to East China and North China during the spring plowing in 1951. From this, it can be seen that when the upper-level cooperative serves the lower-level cooperative, the focus is on how to adjust and guarantee the reasonable profits between each other, and solve the difficulties that the lower-level cooperative cannot solve, to realize the satisfaction of the needs of cooperative members.

            (2) Typical Rationing Plan for Three Million Cooperative Members

The rationing system is the key to making the trade work of cooperatives organized and planned. This time, the typical rationing of three million cooperative members by the National Federation of Cooperatives was drawn from the experience of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Cooperatives. After the National Conference of Cooperative Workers' Representatives, based on the spirit of not aiming at profit-making, not pursuing profits in the free market, and serving cooperative members, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Cooperatives resolutely closed its retail outlets and changed them to wholesale departments. They implemented the rationing of several major goods, surveyed and statistically analyzed the needs of cooperative members, and concentrated all their efforts to meet these needs, so that cooperative members could truly obtain material benefits. After the Beijing Municipal Federation of Cooperatives did this, its business got on the right track and expanded. The organization was consolidated and developed. From the experience of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Cooperatives, it can be seen that after the implementation of typical rationing in various regions in 1951, the work of cooperatives will inevitably be further improved and will have a rapid development.

To implement the rationing system, two issues must first be clarified ideologically.

First, thoroughly clarify the capitalist management thinking. To implement rationing, it is necessary to have accurate statistical figures, to investigate the needs of cooperative members, and to truly serve cooperative members. If you serve the free market and pay attention to doing business with non-cooperative members, because the transactions with non-cooperative members are not fixed, it is impossible to count and plan, and it can only be blind operation. Now, in order to correct this, the General Federation must pass a hurdle - closing the retail departments of cooperative general societies above the county level and changing them to wholesale departments, because the retail department of the cooperative general society is a concrete manifestation of capitalist management thinking. Some comrades say: "The retail department cannot be closed now, and the cadres of the cooperative society cannot afford to be supported." This kind of statement means that the retail department can only be gradually resolved slowly, but in fact, under the cover of this kind of statement, they are still doing free profit-seeking transactions. The purpose of the cooperative society is to serve the cooperative members, not the cadres. The hurdle of the retail department will have to be passed sooner or later. Short pain is better than long pain, and sooner is better than later. The sooner the retail department is closed, the sooner it will get on the right track. The Beijing Municipal Federation of Cooperative Societies resolutely closed the retail department, and after a short period of time, the business greatly expanded, and the shares that had not been paid before were also paid, and new cooperative members joined in large numbers.

Second, some comrades now have unclear understandings of serving cooperative members and serving the working people, or serving the basic masses, serving the peasants, etc. It seems that serving cooperative members cannot serve the broad masses, and they think that serving cooperative members is small, and serving the masses is large. However, the cooperative society is an economic organization of the working people, and the cooperative society can truly benefit the cooperative members materially through business. This material benefit cannot be obtained by ordinary non-cooperative working people, and it generates the power to attract them to join the cooperative society. In this way, absorbing the working people can achieve the goal of organizing the working people and enabling the cooperative society to serve the working people in an organized and planned manner. There is no contradiction between serving cooperative members and serving the masses; serving cooperative members is serving the people, and there should be no other explanation. If you take doing non-cooperative member business as having a mass viewpoint, and ask the cooperative society to bear tasks that the cooperative society cannot perform, such as using the shares of cooperative members to do things for non-cooperative members, there is no distinction in enjoyment between cooperative members and non-cooperative members, and cooperative members have obligations, who would want to join the cooperative society? This makes it impossible for the cooperative society to develop rapidly, or it will drag down the cooperative society. Therefore, this kind of empty idea of "serving the working people and serving the masses" is, like the capitalist management thinking mentioned earlier, an obstacle to the development of the cooperative society on the right track.

However, the cooperative society is not absolutely not doing non-cooperative member transactions. The cooperative society can and should trade with non-cooperative members under the following conditions:

1. Selling slow-moving goods.

2. Purchasing goods needed by cooperative members under favorable conditions.

3. Purchasing non-cooperative members' local products and selling local products to non-cooperative members that are surplus to the needs of cooperative members.

4. Several entrusted purchase and sales businesses of state-owned enterprises.

The above transactions with non-cooperative members are fundamentally different from the previous two ideas, and can link this transaction with non-cooperative working people with promoting their joining the cooperative society. Taking this satisfaction of the needs of non-cooperative working people as a condition for their joining the cooperative society becomes a practice that is beneficial to the development of the cooperative society.

After the cooperative society realizes organized and planned trade and organizes the broad masses of the working people, state-owned trade can mainly engage in wholesale, so that prices can be easily controlled. In addition, when the cooperative society's operation is organized and planned, the production of factories is also easier to plan. The things produced by the factory are sold to the cooperative members through the cooperative society, so that the factory has fixed customers, and the quantity, quality, and style of its products can be produced according to the requirements of the customers, and there is no worry about selling the products after they come out.

This is why the cooperative society must serve the cooperative members, so as to organize the working people, and meet their needs in an organized and planned manner, in order to avoid intermediate exploitation and facilitate the development of the new democratic economy.

The rationing in the first quarter of 1951 is a typical experiment. Because it is an experiment, there is a focus and appropriate consideration to the overall situation. The focus is on the old areas; at the same time, consideration is given to the areas where land reform was implemented in 1950 and some new urban areas with better cooperative societies. In the first quarter, a total of 3.1 million cooperative members were rationed, 1,193,500 in cities and 1,908,000 in rural areas. The cities only rationed cooperative members in factories, schools, and institutions, and not citizen cooperative members.

Rationing of daily necessities: grain, coal, yarn, cloth, kerosene, salt, alkali, and sugar.

These commodities can be guaranteed to be rationed regularly and quantitatively by state-owned trade, and can also be guaranteed after the development of cooperative members. The types of goods rationed in cities and rural areas are basically the same, but the focus of rationing is different, such as cities should ration more grain and coal, and rural areas should ration more cloth. In addition, major administrative regions or provinces can also stipulate some additional items according to their own situation, such as matches, soap, etc., which can be resolved by major administrative regions and provinces by signing contracts with factories in their respective regions. Individual cooperative societies can also regularly or temporarily implement rationing of certain commodities.

Rationing price: Lower than the general preferential price, so that it is significantly lower than the market price, because the market price often changes, if it is not obvious, it is easy to cause the preferential treatment to not exist due to the decrease in the market price. Rationing quantity: In principle, slightly lower than the per capita consumption, so as to avoid cooperative members not being able to use it themselves and reselling it, and also to avoid some cooperative cadres engaging in corruption such as taking care of relatives and friends due to the surplus of rationed goods.

Basic-level cooperative societies that enjoy rationing benefits must meet the following conditions:

1. Not aiming at profit-making and dividends, not pursuing profits in the free market.

2. Clear accounts, settle accounts on time, and announce them to cooperative members on time.

3. Establish an accounting, reporting, and statistical system.

4. The directors and supervisors are elected and can hold meetings on time.

The rationing prices of cooperative societies at all levels must obtain the consent of state-owned trade and be subject to its supervision. The reason for stipulating this is to prevent some cooperative cadres from failing to thoroughly transform their capitalist management thinking, and raising the rationing price for profit-making, so that cooperative members cannot truly obtain cheap rationed goods. At the same time, state-owned trade has preferential treatment for cooperative societies, and state-owned trade has the right and responsibility to supervise.

After the implementation of rationing, the staff, workers, working people, and institutional personnel of urban street cooperative societies will inevitably return to their respective cooperative societies, so the organization of street societies will undergo major changes. However, although ordinary citizen cooperative members cannot enjoy the benefits of rationing, they can still enjoy other benefits of the cooperative society. The result of this will be that factory, institution, and school cooperative societies will have great development and get on the right track, so it is good in general.

            (3) Credit Purchases

The method of credit purchases has been carried out by old area cooperative societies in the past, but it is not as particularly needed as it is now. This is because the years of war have caused farmers to lack many things. After land reform and years of production movements, the economic conditions of farmers have improved. In addition, the national agricultural production in 1950 celebrated a bumper harvest, and farmers are eager to sell surplus products to purchase necessities to supplement what they have lacked for many years. However, due to the current shortage of state funds, it is impossible to purchase as many things as farmers need to sell. Therefore, farmers must first take out their products in order to exchange them for what they want. This is beneficial to farmers, and it is also beneficial to state-owned enterprises and cooperative societies. This is an effective way to rely on the strength of the masses, solve the difficulties of the masses, and invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

Some of the necessities needed by farmers are needed immediately, while others are not needed immediately. For example, fertilizer is only needed during spring plowing. Therefore, as long as it can be guaranteed to be given to them on time, farmers can credit their products to the cooperative society first. Farmers in the old liberated areas trust the people's government due to years of experience, especially cooperative societies that have prestige among farmers, and it is easier to credit purchases to farmers. The Yongnian County Cooperative Society in Hebei Province has been doing credit purchases since 1947 and has a high reputation among farmers, proving that credit purchases can be carried out. But on the other hand, although cooperative societies in the old areas have already carried out such credit purchase work, these experiences have not been systematically summarized and have not been mastered by most cooperative societies, so the figures for this credit purchase are temporarily not set too large, and it is arranged to be carried out in the old areas:

1. 100 million catties of grain; 2. 20 million catties of cotton; 3. More than 60 million catties of oil; 4. 1.5 million catties of wool; 5. 1.5 million pieces of casings.

The first important issue of credit purchases is the pricing issue. There are two ways to price: The first way is to price in currency. When returning the money in the future, it will be based on the listed price, looking at the rise but not the fall. The advantage of this method is that it is conducive to the currency going to the countryside, expanding the currency front, and the procedures are simple. However, what farmers mainly want is not money, but to exchange for what they need. This requires that when repaying the credit, the goods needed by the farmers must be prepared in advance to ensure that the farmers can buy the things they need at a low price as soon as they get the money. The second method is to exchange goods for goods. With the guarantee of grain, coal, and fertilizer (such as cotton-producing areas) that farmers especially need, this is welcomed by farmers. The disadvantage of this method is that there are more types of goods to be exchanged, and the accounting, pricing, calculation, and settlement are very complicated.

The organizational work of credit purchases is more complicated than other businesses. This is a very large credit business of the cooperative society. Under the current situation, the state trade needs it, the farmers are willing, and the cooperative society can also do it. Therefore, the credit purchase business is not only a blitz business for the cooperative society, but also a regular business that it will carry out in the future. This is to rely on the strength of cooperative members to solve the difficulties in the exchange of goods. If this work is done well, its role in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas will be immeasurable.

The second important task of credit purchases is that you must act in accordance with the contract and guarantee to repay the farmers' goods. This is the key to continuing to carry out and promote this business. We must not have the slightest negligence in guaranteeing the repayment of farmers' things after the credit purchase plan is completed.

The exchange of goods in the five provinces of North China is the same in nature as the exchange of goods in the three major regions, so I won't talk about it much. I will only point out that the exchange of grain and cloth between Chahar, Suiyuan, and Hebei is urgently needed by both sides, but because the grain price in Chahar and Suiyuan is too high, it causes losses in the exchange of grain and cloth, so that the exchange contract cannot be signed. Finally, the National Federation of Cooperatives controls the operation, combining this business with the exchange of goods between other major regions, and using the surplus obtained from there to fill the losses of this exchange business before the agreement is signed. Such a situation may also be encountered by other major administrative region societies and even county societies when organizing the exchange of goods in lower-level societies. This is also one of the experiences of upper-level societies serving lower-level societies.

To sum up the above businesses, the three forms of business, namely the horizontal exchange of goods between regions, the downward flow of industrial products to the countryside from top to bottom, and the upward flow of agricultural and sideline products to the cities from bottom to top, constitute the cooperative society's own trade network. The above various forms of business are not completely separate and carried out independently, but are one or more kinds of business that are often connected or closely combined, which not only meet the needs of cooperative members, but also save circulating funds and accelerate the turnover of funds.

To realize each business plan, it is necessary to formulate a material concentration and distribution plan, a transportation plan, the establishment of cargo yards and warehouses, accounting reports, a financial plan, and a plan for reorganizing and developing the organization, and formulate these plans after careful calculation, which is considered to have economic accounting. After the plan of the National Federation of Cooperatives is made, the major regions, provinces (cities), counties, and even basic-level societies must formulate their own implementation plans step by step and guarantee the realization of their own plans by all means. Therefore, the cooperative society's business is a complex organizational work, not a simple buying and selling relationship. This kind of operation is planned and organized, not a capitalist blind operation. When we realize organizing business for the needs of cooperative members in a planned manner, the development of the cooperative society will be rapid, and it will be able to gradually reduce the disorganized market and expand the organized market.

The supply and marketing business in the first quarter of 1951 is mainly these. I hope everyone will discuss it and propose amendments.

Finally, let's talk about the relationship between the cooperative society and state-owned trade agencies and other aspects. The work of the cooperative society is closely related to state-owned trade, tax authorities, railways, banks, and other aspects, especially the relationship with state-owned trade is the closest. In the past, the relationship between the cooperative society and state-owned trade was generally good, but because some cooperative societies sold state-owned trade's cheap goods in the free market, it caused losses to state-owned trade. Therefore, state-owned trade is unwilling to give preferential treatment to cooperative societies. We comrades who work in the cooperative society must realize that the cooperative society cannot develop without the help of state-owned trade. To establish a good relationship with each other, the cooperative society must adhere to two principles:

First, do your own work well, first of all, do not pursue profits in the free market, and put the cooperative society's business on the right track. Because state-owned trade gives many preferential treatments to the cooperative society, plus bank interest, tax and other preferential treatments, the cooperative society's goods are not only cheaper than private merchants, but also cheaper than retail stores. If the cooperative society goes to do market transactions after receiving preferential treatment, it will disrupt the market. Therefore, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of the state's preferential treatment for the cooperative society is to give preferential treatment to the cooperative society's members, preferential treatment to organized working people, not preferential treatment to the cooperative society, let alone preferential treatment to the staff of the cooperative society. It is to organize 90% of the working people, not for other purposes. Therefore, cooperative societies at all levels should strictly review the lower-level societies. Cooperative societies that do free market trade cannot enjoy preferential treatment. This can urge those cooperative societies that are not like cooperative societies to get on the right track quickly. Mastering this makes the cooperative society not abuse preferential treatment, which is of great benefit to the development of the cooperative society.

Second, solve the problems between the two sides through consultation in the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. Some comrades in the cooperative society always want to take advantage of state-owned trade when trading with state-owned trade, thinking that they are serving the masses, and state-owned trade is the government's, so they should take advantage of it. This understanding is wrong. State-owned trade helps the cooperative society, and the cooperative society should also help state-owned trade, such as helping state-owned trade with cheaper products in credit purchase work. You must help each other on the principle of mutual benefit. At the same time, you should exchange more information and consult more with each other to solve problems in time, so that you can make the relationship between each other better and better. I hope that in the future, cooperative societies at all levels will summarize more good experiences in this area and report them to the upper levels step by step, so that they can be promoted as typical examples.

The supply and marketing business in the first quarter of 1951 is mainly these. I hope everyone will discuss it and propose amendments.
When carrying out these businesses, the leading cadres of cooperative societies at all levels should consciously grasp the typical examples and cultivate typical examples. The National Federation of Cooperatives draws on the experience of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Cooperatives and promotes it to the whole country. We must regard mastering typical examples and cultivating typical examples as an extremely important leadership method and working method.

　　一九五一年第一季度供销业务的方针与计划
    ——全国合作社联合总社程子华副主任在一九五○年十二月十六日全国合作社贸易采购业务会议上的报告同志们：
    中华全国合作总社第一次临时理事会已经通过了一九五一年第一季度的供销业务计划。这计划主要的包括了下面三个内容：（一）华东、华北、东北三大行政区的交换物资。（二）三百万社员的典型配售计划。（三）赊购。
    以后，我们又组织了华北五省的交换物资。也成为一九五一年第一季度计划的一部分。
    一九五一年第一季度总的贸易采购数字比这四个还要多，这计划不是全部数字，但主要的数字却有了。尤其是供销业务的几种形式都有了。
    下面我来谈一谈几个业务计划的要点：
            （一）三大区交换物资
    三大区交换物资的目的是为了把华北、华东、东北社员最需要的物资解决一部分。东北社员需要棉花和布匹，他们为了买进棉布，就需要把自己的粮食和豆饼卖出；华北、华东能够供给东北棉布和一部土产，以换回自己需要的东北的粮食和豆饼。全国总社为了解决这种相互的需要，组织了这三大区的工业品与农副产品的交换，以推销东北社员一部粮食、豆饼，供给他们急需的布匹、棉花；以推销华北、华东社员一部土产和工业品，为他们解决缺粮困难，和准备一九五一年春天所需要的肥料，这种交换是减少中间流通环节的重要方法。
    这种合作社之间的交换物资，过去在各级社之间都曾不断地进行过，也都解决了一些问题。但是，把它提到上级社为下级社服务的方针上来认识，作为上级社经常有计划地组织这样的交换，尚没有为一般合作社所重视。因此，也就不能极大地活跃城乡物资交换，以满足下级社和社员供销的要求。
    这次三大区之间的交换物资，是在全国总社领导下有组织有计划地进行的。这是第一次全国性的交换物资。全国总社缺乏这样大规模组织交换物资的经验，但是希望把这一工作做好，作成一个良好的开端。因此，在原则上要求交换物资的种类要少，数量要小，东西要好，价格要低。我们卖给物资的对方，是合作社的社员，如果东西好，价钱又便宜，对方满意了，第二次第三次的交换就好做了，假如东西不好，价钱又贵，以后的交换就不好进行。所以坚持这些原则，不仅是全国总社的任务，也是各级合作社以至社员的任务。
    从一九五○年十二月至一九五一年六月总共交换主要物资的数量如下：
    东北区运往华北、华东：豆饼十万吨，大豆十万吨，玉米、红粮十万吨；
    华北、华东运往东北：皮棉二百万斤，各种布六十万匹。
    其他数量较少的东西，如葵花子、毛料（竹枝）、针织品等，全国总社没有组织交换，由各大区相互另行订立合同。
    这次交换物资是大家都需要的，但在实际做时也碰到了一些困难。首先是经营思想问题。七月会议后，反对资本主义的经营思想基本上是一致了，但这种思想上的一致，还未能在业务经营上完全体现出来。在开始商订合同时，曾暴露了并批判了各地区提出要推销的产品，不是从社员需要出发，而是从地区需要出发的资本主义的经营思想。由于过去做自由市场贸易买卖的资本主义思想未彻底转变，没有完全为社员服务的决心，因而在制订合同算细账时，对于货物的价格、包装、运输、损耗等拿不出精确的统计数字，对于社员需要也没有统计及确实可靠的数字。另外，各大行政区社因考虑物价涨落不定，不敢订立合同，改订协议。全国总社为使这一协议能够订成，担负了物价波动时加以调整的责任，因为各地区间物价差额较大，在把合理利润和合理开支精打细算地规定以后，地区差价的总数相当大，大家同意此数由全国总社掌握，以便在物价波动时加以调整。最后，除留出一部作为全国合作社基本建设之用外，将盈余返还各区。
    在这次订立合同中，看出地区之间的交换物资，当着一方面需要，另一方面不即需要时，尤其某一方面的利润没有确定保障时，虽然两方面均迫切需要交换物资，但如没有上级社来负责组织，是很难订立较大的交换物资合同的。如东北急需要棉布，华东、华北可以供给；又如东北的豆饼，华东、华北都需要，但是在一九五一年春耕时才要，现在马上运来，势必积压资金。因此，相互间就不能直接订立合同，必须全国总社来组织，从中垫一批钱，把东北的豆饼运来，放到一九五一年春耕时供给华东和华北。从此看出，上级社为下级社服务时，中心是在如何调整和保证相互间的合理利润，解决下级社所不能解决的困难，以实现满足社员的需要。
            （二）三百万社员的典型配售计划
    配售制是使合作社的贸易工作，走向有组织有计划的关键。这次全国总社三百万社员的典型配售，是从北京市总社的经验吸取来的。北京市总社在全国合作社工作者代表会议后，本着会议的不以营利为目的，不在自由市场上去追逐利润，为社员服务的精神，坚决地关掉了零售门市部，改为批发部。实行几种主要货物的配售，调查统计社员的需要，并集中全力去满足这些需要，使社员真正得到物质的实惠。北京市总社在这样做了以后，业务走上了正轨，并且扩大了。组织上得到了巩固并有了发展。从北京市总社的经验中可以看到，一九五一年在各地区实行典型配售后，合作社的工作，必然进一步提高，并且会有一个猛烈的发展。
    为了实行配售制，首先必须在思想上明确两个问题。
    第一，彻底澄清资本主义的经营思想。为了实行配售，就一定要有精确的统计数字，就要调查社员的需要，真正为社员服务，如为自由市场服务，用主要注意去做非社员买卖，因为非社员的交易是不固定的，就不可能统计，不可能计划，只能是盲目的经营。现在总社为了纠正这一点，就要过一个关——关掉县以上总社门市部，改为批发部，因为合作总社门市部是资本主义的经营思想的具体表现。有些同志说：“门市部现在还不能关，关了养不起社干部。”这样的提法，是门市部只能慢慢地逐渐解决，而事实上在这种提法的掩护下，仍在做自由追逐利润的交易。合作社的目的，要为社员服务，不是为干部服务，门市部这个关迟早是要过的。长痛不如短痛，迟过不如早过，早一天关掉门市部早一天走上正轨。北京市总社坚决地关掉了门市部，在一个短时间后，业务就大为扩大了，原先没有缴的股金也都缴了，新的社员大批加入了。
    第二，现在有些同志对于为社员服务和为劳动人民服务，或说为基本群众、为农民服务等，在认识上是不明确的。好像为社员服务就不能为广大群众服务，认为为社员服务面小，为群众服务面大。殊不知合作社是劳动人民的经济组织，合作社经过业务，使社员真正得到物质实惠。这种物质实惠，既为一般非社员的劳动人民所不能得到，就产生了吸引他们加入合作社的力量。这样，把劳动人民吸收进来，才能达到组织劳动人民，使合作社有组织有计划地为劳动人民服务的目的。为社员和为群众的两者之间是没有矛盾的；为社员服务即是为人民服务，此外，不应有其他解释。如以作非社员买卖为有群众观点，把合作社不能胜任的任务叫合作社负担，如以社员的股金去作非社员的事情，社员非社员在享受上没有区别，社员倒负有义务，谁还愿意加入合作社？这样就使合作社不能得到迅速的发展，或者把合作社拖垮。所以这种空泛的“为劳动人民，为群众”服务的思想，与前面讲的资本主义的经营思想一样，是障碍着合作社正轨发展的。
    但合作社并不是绝对不作非社员交易，合作社在下列条件之下是可以而且应该与非社员交易的，这些条件是：
    １、出卖滞销货物。
    ２、在有利条件下，采买合作社社员所需要的货物。
    ３、收购非社员土产，并向非社员推销满足社员有余的土产。
    ４、国营委托的若干代购代销业务。
    以上这些对非社员的交易，与前两种思想根本不同，而且可以把这种对非社员的劳动人民的交易，和宣传他们加入合作社联系起来。把这种满足非社员的劳动人民的需要，作为其加入合作社的条件，就成为有利于合作社发展的一种作法。
    合作社在实现了有组织有计划的贸易，把广大劳动人民组织起来后，国营贸易就可以主要的搞批发，这样物价就好掌握了。另外，合作社经营做到了有组织有计划时，工厂的生产也就容易有计划性了。工厂出产的东西，经过合作社卖给社员，这样工厂就有了固定的主顾，它的产品的数量、质量、样式都可随主顾的要求来生产，产品出来后，也不愁推销不了。
    这就是合作社必须为社员服务，以便组织劳动人民，有组织有计划地满足其需要，才能避免中间剥削，才能有利于新民主主义经济的发展。
    一九五一年第一季度的配售是典型试验。因为是试验，所以有重点和适当地照顾到面，重点在老区；同时照顾到一九五○年实行土地改革的地区和某些合作社较好的新区城市。第一季度共配售社员三百一十万，城市一、一九三、五○○人，农村一、九○八、○○○人，城市只配售工厂、学校、机关的社员，不配售市民社员。
    配售的生活必需品：粮、煤、纱、布、煤油、盐、碱、糖。
    这些商品都是国营贸易能够保证定期、定量配售，而且是在社员发展后也能保证的。城市和乡村配售的商品种类基本上一样，但配售时的重点不一样，如城市要多配售粮、煤，乡村要多配售布。此外，各大行政区或省，除国家保证的商品外，还可以按自己的情况另规定一些，如火柴、肥皂等，可分由各大行政区各省与各自地区的工厂订立合同解决。个别的合作社亦可以经常地或临时地以若干商品实行配售。
    配售价格：低于一般优待价格，使之显明的低于市价，因为市价常有变动，如不显明，很容易因市价降低，而致优待不存在。配售的数量：原则上稍低于每个人的消费量，这样可以避免社员自己用不了而转卖掉，也可以避免某些社干部因配售品有剩余，而照顾亲戚朋友等贪污行为。
    享受配售待遇的基层合作社，必须具备下列条件：
    一、不以营利分红为目的，不在自由市场上追逐利润。
    二、账目清楚，按期结账，按期向社员公布。
    三、建立会计、表报、统计制度。
    四、理监事是选举的，并能按期开会。
    各级合作社的配售价格，必须取得国营贸易的同意，并受其监督。所以规定这一条，是为了防止有些合作社干部资本主义经营思想未彻底转变，为了营利而提高配售价格，致使社员不能真正得到低廉的配售物品。同时，国营贸易优待了合作社，国营贸易是有权利和责任来监督的。
    实行配售后，城市街道合作社的职工、劳动人民、机关人员必然要回到各自的合作社去，这样街道社的组织将发生大的变化。不过一般市民社员虽不能享受配售的好处，但合作社其他好处还是能够享受的。这样的结果，将使工厂、机关、学校合作社有很大的发展和走上正轨，故从总的方面说起来是好的。
            （三）赊购
    赊购的办法，过去老区合作社曾经进行过，但不如现在这样特别地感到需要。这是由于多年战争的破坏，使农民缺乏很多东西，经过了土地改革和几年来的生产运动，农民的经济状况改善了，加上一九五○年全国农业生产普庆丰收，农民急于出售多余产品，以购买必需品，来补充多年来缺乏的东西。但由于目前国家资金不足，不可能收购农民须要出卖的那样多的东西，因此要农民先将产品拿出，以便换回所要的东西。这样，对农民是有利的，对国营企业和合作社也是有利的。这是依靠群众力量，解决群众困难，活跃城乡物资交流的有效办法。
    农民需要的必需品，有些东西是马上需要的，有些东西却不是马上需要的。如肥料是春耕时才需要的。因此，只要能按时保证给他们肥料，农民是可以把他们的产品先赊给合作社的。老解放区农民由于多少年来的经验，是信任人民政府的，特别是在农民中有威信的合作社，比较容易向农民赊购。河北省永年县合作社自一九四七年起就做赊购，在农民中很有威信，证明赊购可以进行。但另一方面，在各地老区的合作社，虽已经进行过这样的赊购工作，但这些经验尚未经过系统的总结，也还没有为大多数合作社所掌握，所以这次赊购的数字暂不定得太大，在老区布置进行：
    １，粮食一亿斤；２，棉花二千万斤；３，油料六千多万斤；４，羊毛一百五十万斤；５，肠衣一百五十万根。
    赊购的第一个重要问题是定价问题。定价有两个办法：第一个办法是以货币计价。将来还钱时按牌价，看涨不看落。这办法的好处是有利于货币下乡，扩大货币阵地，而且手续简单。但农民主要的不是要钱，而是要换回他需要的东西，这就要在偿还赊款时，事先准备好农民需要的货物，以便保证农民一拿到钱，就可以廉价地买到需要的东西。第二个办法是以货换货。对农民特别需要的粮、煤、肥料（如棉产地区）有了保证，这是农民欢迎的。这个办法的缺点是换货种类多了，记账，定价，算账，结账很复杂。
    赊购比其他业务的组织工作较为繁杂，这是合作社一个很大的信用业务。在目前情况下，国家贸易需要，农民愿意，合作社也能作到，因此赊购业务对合作社来说，不仅是一个突击业务，而且要当作自己今后的经常业务来进行。这是依靠社员力量，解决物资交流中的困难。这个工作作好，对于城乡物资交流中的作用，将是不可限量的。
    赊购的第二个重要工作，就是必须按照合同办事，保证偿还农民的东西，这是继续进行和推广这一业务的关键。我们绝不能在赊购计划完成后，对保证偿还农民的东西有丝毫的疏忽。
    华北五省的交换物资与三大区交换物资是同一性质的业务，因此就不多谈了。只指出一点，就是察、绥与河北的粮、布交换，是两方面都迫切需要的，可是由于察、绥粮价过高，造成粮、布交换的亏损，以致不能订立交换合同，最后由全国总社掌握经营，把这一业务与其他大区之间的交换物资结合起来，把从那里所得的盈余，填补这一交换业务的亏损，才订立了协议。这样的情况，在其他大行政区社以至县社在组织下级社的物资交换时也会遇到。这也是上级社为下级社服务的经验之一。
    总括以上各项业务，就是各地区相互之间的横的交换物资，由上而下的工业品下乡，由下而上的农副产品进城的三种形式的业务，就构成了合作社自己的贸易网。以上各种形式的业务，并不是完全各自分立地单独进行的，而是一种以上的业务，经常联系着或密切结合着进行的，既适应社员的需要，又节省了流动资金和加速了资金的周转。
    为了实现每一个业务计划，须要根据业务计划制订物资的集中与分配计划，运输计划，货栈仓库的设置，会计表报，财务计划，整理和发展组织计划，经过精打细算制订出这些计划，才算有了经济核算。全国总社的计划有了，还必须各大区，省（市）、县以至基层社，逐级地订出自己的实施计划，并用一切方法保证自己计划的实现。因此，合作社的业务是个复杂的组织工作，不是一个简单的买卖关系，这样经营业务，才是有计划的，有组织的经营业务，不是资本主义的盲目的经营业务。当着实现了有计划地为社员需要而组织业务时，合作社的发展，将是突飞猛进的，就能逐渐的缩小无组织的市场，扩大有组织的市场。
    一九五一年第一季度的供销业务已如上述，在进行这些业务时，各级社的领导干部应该有意识地抓住典型和培养典型。全国总社就是吸取了北京市总社的配售经验，推行到全国范围内实行。我们要把掌握典型培养典型作为一个极为重要的领导方法和工作方法。
    最后，谈一下合作社和国营贸易机关等各方面的关系问题。合作社工作，与国营贸易，税收机关，铁路，银行等各方面都发生着密切关系，尤其和国营贸易的关系最为密切。过去合作社和国营贸易的关系一般是好的，但由于有些合作社以国营贸易的廉价商品在自由市场上出卖，就使得国营贸易受到损失。因此，国营贸易就不愿意优待合作社。我们作合作社工作的同志必须认识，合作社如果得不到国营贸易的帮助是不可能发展的。为了建立起相互间的良好关系，在合作社方面须要坚持两条原则：
    第一，作好自己的工作，首先是不到自由市场上去追逐利润，使合作社业务走上正轨。因为，国营贸易给合作社很多优待，加上银行利息，税收等的优待，合作社的商品就不仅比私商便宜，也比零售商店便宜。如果合作社在得到优待后去作市场交易，就会扰乱了市场。因此必须了解国家优待合作社的目的，是为了优待合作社的社员，优待有组织的劳动人民，而不是优待合作社，更不是优待合作社的工作人员。是为了组织百分之九十的劳动人民，不是为了其他。所以各级合作社要严格地对下级社进行审查，凡作自由市场贸易的合作社，就不能享受优待，这样可督促那些不像合作社的合作社，很快地走上正轨。这样地掌握，使合作社不滥用优待，对于合作社的发展是有极大好处的。
    第二，要在互助两利的原则下，以协商方法解决双方的问题。合作社有些同志在和国营贸易交易时，总想占国营贸易的便宜，以为自己是为群众服务，国营贸易是政府的，应该占点便宜。这种认识是错误的，国营贸易帮助合作社，合作社也应帮助国营贸易，如在赊购工作上，或以收购便宜产品帮助国营贸易，要在两利原则下互相帮助。同时要相互多交换情况多协商，以便及时解决问题，这样就能把相互间的关系越搞越好。希望各级社今后把这方面好的经验，多加总结，按级向上报告，以便作为典型予以推广。
    一九五一年第一季度的供销业务，主要的就是这些，希望大家加以讨论，并提出修正的意见。
