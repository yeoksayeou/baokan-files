Unite and Advance Under the Great Banner of Patriotism
—Commenting on the Achievements of the Central Meetings of Various Democratic Parties
　　While the people of the whole country are victoriously carrying out the movement to resist US aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Jiusan Society, and other democratic parties held central meetings successively from November to December last year, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a meeting of central executive and supervisory committee members in Beijing. The central meetings of the various democratic parties conducted enthusiastic and serious discussions on the current political tasks of the various democratic parties and the consolidation and development of the organizations of the various democratic parties in the future, and achieved significant achievements. This meeting is a major event in the development process of various democratic parties, and also a manifestation of the further consolidation of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front.
　　The central meetings of the various democratic parties focused on discussing two major topics, namely, how to concentrate efforts on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and how to consolidate and develop the organizations of the various democratic parties, and made correct political resolutions and organizational resolutions on the above issues respectively.
　　The discussions on the topic of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea at the central meetings of the various democratic parties and the political resolutions made, demonstrated the firm will of the various democratic parties and the classes they are associated with to resist the US imperialist aggression against China; demonstrated that the people of all classes across the country have united into an iron bastion under the great banner of patriotism, defending the peace of the motherland. The central meetings of the various democratic parties unanimously supported the joint declaration of the various democratic parties on November 4 last year, and resolved to strive for its complete realization with more active practical actions. Through earnest, enthusiastic discussions and criticisms, the representatives attending the meetings received important political education and improved their political understanding. The representatives attending the central meetings of the various democratic parties unanimously recognized the strength of the world's democratic forces, recognized the emergence of the People's Republic of China in Asia and its immeasurable role in the world's democratic camp during its consolidation and development over the past year; at the same time, they recognized the fragility of the imperialist camp and its insurmountable contradictions, especially recognizing the power of US imperialism, exposing the essence of this paper tiger, thus enhancing the concept of hating, despising, and scorning US imperialism, and consolidating the firm belief in winning lasting peace. This ensures ideological consistency and unity of action among the various democratic parties on the correct political line. Undoubtedly, this political gain will enable the various democratic parties to play a greater role in the anti-US aggression and aid-Korea movement in the future. The performance of various democratic parties in various regions after the central meetings has proved the significant impact of this meeting.
　　The central meetings of the various democratic parties decided to make the consolidation and development of organizations one of the central tasks in the future. This is an important decision made based on a correct assessment of the historical role of the various democratic parties in the construction of new China. This decision is absolutely necessary, because only by relying on consolidated, sound, and reasonably sized organizations can we ensure that the various democratic parties effectively achieve their political tasks.
　　As is well known, in the past struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the various democratic parties participated in the national and democratic revolutionary movements and had a history of cooperation and struggle with the Chinese Communist Party. It is precisely because of this that the people's camp was strengthened and the victory of the Chinese people's revolution was accelerated in the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the various democratic parties also participated in the democratic coalition government, all taking the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as their own program and accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Since then, the various democratic parties have played and will continue to play an important historical role in eliminating domestic remnants, opposing imperialist aggression, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and building the new China. Therefore, the consolidation and development of the organizations of the various democratic parties is entirely in line with the interests of the Chinese people. Because only in this way can the various democratic parties more effectively carry out their historical tasks, that is, to influence and educate the objects they have already contacted and may contact with the Common Program, unite them around the Central People's Government, and jointly fight for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and for the construction of new China.
　　To this end, the meetings of the various democratic parties appropriately stipulated the main objects of organizational development. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang decided to take on-the-job civil servants, especially former Kuomintang members among them, as the main targets for recruitment. At the same time, it actively strived for ordinary former Kuomintang members who had been tested and performed well in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea or in the land reform work. The China Democratic League mainly developed intellectuals in the cultural and educational circles, including cultural and educational workers and college students. The China National Democratic Construction Association decided to focus on absorbing small and medium-sized national industrialists and businessmen, and to go deep into various industries. The China Association for Promoting Democracy determined that the focus of development was cultural, educational, and scientific and technological workers, and paid attention to developing towards primary and secondary school teachers. The Jiusan Society determined to take people from academic circles as the main development object, to absorb cultural, educational, and scientific workers.
　　There is no doubt that the determination of the objects of organizational development by the various democratic parties is in line with their respective historical conditions and practical political needs. The implementation of these decisions will enable the various democratic parties to have more power to unite and educate the classes they are connected with, so that people from all walks of life can more organizedly join the struggle to defend peace and build new China.
　　In order to implement the decision to develop organizations, there must be a correct guiding principle for organizational work. In this regard, the central meetings of the various democratic parties also conducted serious discussions. The various democratic parties commonly believed in this aspect of discussion that the following basic principles should be observed in developing organizational work: First, develop organizations with emphasis rather than universally, concentrate efforts on establishing appropriately sized organizations in first- and second-tier cities, and avoid dispersing forces. Second, the admission of party members, league members, members, and society members should have a basic condition, that is, they must support the Common Program and be willing to fight for its realization. Third, develop organizations with a cautious and serious attitude, and prevent "left" or right deviations, that is, on the one hand, we must oppose passive closed-doorism, and on the other hand, we must oppose unprincipled "open-doorism." Fourth, adopt a policy of combining development and consolidation. While developing, we should consolidate internal unity, strengthen work and study, train cadres, and enrich the leadership structure. All these guidelines for organizational development are very necessary. As long as these guidelines are put into practice and the development of organizations is closely linked with the actual movements of each period, that is, developing organizations by actively participating in and promoting actual struggles, we believe that the organizations of the various democratic parties will be more consolidated and strengthened.
　　The Chinese Communist Party warmly welcomes the political and organizational resolutions made by the various democratic parties, and is willing to actively assist them in all aspects to ensure their smooth implementation. To this end, party members in various organs, groups, and schools should correctly understand the historical role of the various democratic parties in the Chinese revolutionary movement, and carry out propaganda on this aspect to the masses, while adopting various methods to help them implement political and organizational resolutions, consolidate and develop organizations.
　　Now, the resolutions of the central meetings of the various democratic parties are being implemented in various regions. We believe that due to the conscientious implementation of these resolutions, the people's democratic united front in our country will be further consolidated and expanded.

　　在伟大爱国主义旗帜下团结前进
    ——评各民主党派中央会议的成就
    在全国人民胜利开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动之际，中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、民主建国会、中国民主促进会、九三学社等民主党派，于去年十一月至十二月先后举行了中央会议，中国农工民主党则举行了在京的中央执监委员会议。各民主党派的中央会议，对各民主党派当前的政治任务和今后各民主党派的组织的巩固与发展，进行了热烈而严肃的讨论，而且获得了重大的成就。这次会议是各民主党派发展过程中的重大事件，也是中国人民民主统一战线更加巩固的一个表现。
    各民主党派的中央会议都着重地讨论了两大议题，即如何集中力量实行抗美援朝，与如何巩固和发展各民主党派的组织，并分别对上述问题作出了正确的政治决议和组织决议。
    各民主党派中央会议对于抗美援朝这一议题的讨论及其所作出的政治决议，表明了各民主党派及其所联系的阶层，对于抗击美帝国主义对中国的侵略，具有坚定的意志；表明了全国各阶层人民已在伟大爱国主义旗帜下团结成钢铁堡垒，捍卫着祖国的和平。各民主党派中央会议一致支持去年十一月四日各民主党派的联合宣言，并决以更积极的实际行动为其彻底实现而奋斗。这些会议经过认真的热烈的讨论和批判，使到会的代表受到了重要的政治教育，提高了政治的认识。参加各民主党派中央会议的代表们，一致认识了世界民主力量的强大，认识了中华人民共和国的出现于亚洲，及其一年来的巩固与发展，在世界民主阵营中所起的不可估量的作用；同时，认识了帝国主义阵营的脆弱及其不可克服的矛盾，特别认识了美帝国主义的力量，揭穿了这只纸老虎的本质，因而增强了仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的观念，巩固了对争取持久和平的必胜信念。这就保证了各民主党派在正确政治路线上的思想一致和行动一致。无疑的，这个政治上的收获将使各民主党派在今后的抗美援朝运动中发挥其更大的作用。各民主党派中央会议后在各地的表现，都证明了这一次会议的重大的影响。
    各民主党派的中央会议，都决定以巩固与发展组织作为今后中心任务之一。这是基于对各民主党派在新中国建设中的历史作用之正确估计而作出的重要决定。这种决定是完全必要的，因为必须依靠巩固的健全的而又有相当规模的组织，才能保证各民主党派有效地达成其政治任务。
    如所周知，各民主党派在过去反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争中，曾参加过民族的和民主的革命运动，并与中国共产党有着合作奋斗的历史，正因为如此，才在中国人民的革命运动中增强了人民阵营，加速了中国人民革命的胜利。在中华人民共和国成立以后，各民主党派又都参加了民主联合政府，都以人民政协共同纲领为自己的纲领，并接受中国共产党的领导。自此以后，各民主党派在肃清国内残敌，反对帝国主义侵略，巩固人民民主专政，建设新中国的革命事业上，又发挥了而且还要继续发挥着重要的历史作用。因此，各民主党派组织的巩固与发展，是完全符合中国人民利益的。因为只有如此，才能使各民主党派更有效地执行自己的历史任务，即以共同纲领去影响与教育它们所已经联系的和可能联系的对象，把他们团结在中央人民政府周围，为抗美援朝，与新中国的建设而共同奋斗。
    为此，各民主党派的会议适当地规定了发展组织的主要对象。中国国民党革命委员会决定以在职公务人员特别是其中的旧国民党员为主要吸收对象，同时，对一般的旧国民党员，凡在抗美援朝运动中或土地改革工作中经过考验而有良好表现者亦加以积极争取。中国民主同盟的发展对象以文化教育界的知识分子为主，包括文化教育工作者和大学生等。民主建国会决定着重吸收中小民族工商业家，并深入到各行各业中去。中国民主促进会确定发展的重点是文化界、教育界和科学技术工作者，并注意向中小学教职员方面发展。九三学社确定以学术界人士为主要发展对象，以吸收文化、教育、科学工作者。
    毫无疑问，各民主党派对于发展组织的对象的确定，是切合它们各自的历史条件与实际政治需要的。这些决定的贯彻执行，将使各民主党派更有力量去团结与教育它们所联系的阶层，使各阶层社会人士更有组织地走到保卫和平与建设新中国的斗争中来。
    为了贯彻发展组织的决定，必须有正确的组织工作的方针。对此，各民主党派的中央会议也都进行了认真的讨论。各民主党派在这一方面的讨论，共同认为：在发展组织工作中，应遵守下列几个基本原则：第一，有重点地而不是普遍地发展组织，集中力量在头二等城市中建立适当规模的组织，而避免分散力量。第二，吸收党员、盟员、会员、社员应有一个基本条件，即必须拥护共同纲领，并愿为其实现而奋斗。第三，以谨慎严肃的态度来发展组织，防止“左”的或右的偏向，即一方面要反对消极的关门主义，另一方面又要反对无原则的“开门”。第四，采取发展与巩固相结合的方针。与发展同时，应巩固内部的团结，加强工作和学习，培养干部，充实领导机构。所有这些发展组织的方针都是十分必要的。只要这些方针见诸实行，并把发展组织与每一时期的实际运动紧密联系起来，即在积极参加与推动实际斗争中来发展组织，我们相信，各民主党派的组织是会更加巩固和壮大起来的。
    中国共产党对于各民主党派所作的政治决议与组织决议，表示热烈欢迎，并愿从各方面加以积极协助，使之顺利实现。为此，各机关、团体和学校中的党员，应该正确地认识各民主党派在中国革命运动中的历史作用，并向群众进行有关这一方面的宣传，同时采取各种方法帮助它们贯彻政治的和组织的决议，巩固和发展组织。
    现在，各民主党派中央会议的决议正在各地执行。我们相信，由于这些决议的认真执行，将使我国人民民主统一战线进一步地巩固和扩大。
