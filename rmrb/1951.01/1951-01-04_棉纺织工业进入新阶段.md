　　Cotton Textile Industry Enters New Stage
　　Yu Liting

　　I

　　The improvement in the national financial and economic situation has brought about an improvement in the cotton textile industry.

　　After August last year, due to the bumper harvests in various parts of the country, the people's purchasing power generally increased, and the demand for yarn and cloth surged, bringing an expanded market to the cotton textile industry. In September and October, following the national bumper cotton harvest, with output exceeding 1949 by 56 percent, the raw materials needed by the cotton textile industry were basically self-sufficient. In this way, the price ratio of cotton to yarn began to tend towards a normal state, and the processing fees for contract spinning were also appropriately adjusted. The public and private cotton textile industries, which had undergone initial reforms, were able to obtain considerable profits. Therefore, the cotton textile industry quickly shifted from a state of struggling to maintain itself to full recovery. Around October last year, all factories across the country that had temporarily suspended operations and dispersed were successively restored with the help of local people's governments. Factories in cotton-producing areas such as North China, Central South, and Northwest China began to add new equipment one after another. In order to meet the needs of the people throughout the country, starting from October, work was carried out for six days and six nights across the country. From October to November, state-owned cotton textile factories and some factories that spun for the state also carried out production increase campaigns. This production increase campaign achieved significant success. Due to the enthusiastic response and selfless labor of workers in various places, output greatly exceeded the planned targets. Taking the state-owned factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao alone, the average exceeded the planned targets by 19.03 percent. In this way, by the end of November, state-owned factories across the country had completed the annual plan for 1950 one month ahead of schedule. Cotton yarn completed 101.44 percent of the annual plan ahead of schedule, and cotton cloth completed 100.69 percent of the annual plan ahead of schedule. Based on the actual output from January to October last year and the planned output for November and December, public and private cotton textile factories across the country could complete 118 percent of the initial planned output for last year. This figure is equivalent to 97 percent of the highest annual output before the war (1930), exceeding the year before the War of Resistance (1936) by 14 percent! This means that in the year since the establishment of the Central People's Government, the cotton textile industry has rapidly recovered to the highest output of the past 20 years.

　　II

　　Based on the current output, it is roughly possible to meet current needs. However, from a developmental point of view, if last year's actual output is taken as this year's planned output, it will undoubtedly be impossible to meet the needs of the people throughout the country in 1951. In order to supply the needs of the people throughout the country this year, the output of yarn and cloth must be appropriately increased. Based on this realistic situation, the National Cotton Textile Conference unanimously agreed that the guiding principle for 1951 should be: "Increase production, improve management, focus on construction, and develop steadily." This guiding principle is entirely correct. The National Cotton Textile Conference, based on this guiding principle and according to market needs and raw material supply, preliminarily determined the production plan for 1951. This plan will increase by 33 percent compared to the projected output for 1950, exceeding the highest annual output before the war by 28 percent; it will exceed the output of 1936 by 50.6 percent. This will be the highest output in the history of China's cotton textile industry!

　　After this conference, the cotton textile industry has stepped into its new stage - the stage of development.

　　To complete such a huge planned figure, it is necessary to organize all existing forces and appropriately add new equipment.

　　The National Cotton Textile Conference has specifically allocated this plan to major administrative regions and major regions.

　　In the past year, national public and private production plans have been formulated, but limited by the actual situation, the plans have only been consciously implemented among state-owned factories and private factories in individual regions. The experience of the past year has proved that production according to plan is of great benefit to the country and every factory. The state uses this to understand and grasp the country's raw materials and finished products, and to put the textile industry on the track of regular production. For each factory, having a plan provides a concrete direction for management.

　　In the past, we had higher plans in order to compete for higher contract spinning processing, and lower plans in order to easily complete production. This time, the plan is formulated based on the number of equipment in various places and the actual production efficiency. For factories in various places, it is concrete and feasible. To implement and guarantee the execution of this plan is to guarantee that there is sufficient yarn and cloth to supply the needs of the people throughout the country.

　　To complete this huge plan, it is necessary for every worker involved in actual production to understand the plan. Every factory, on the one hand, must keep state secrets from enemies and people unrelated to the work, and on the other hand, must also enable the masses of workers to fully understand the importance of the plan of the factory and workshop and its actual situation. When these two are combined, the plan can become the pointer of practical action.

　　III

　　To realize such a huge plan, the cooperation of technical and management aspects is also needed. Without good cooperation in these two aspects, the plan will be difficult to guarantee implementation. In view of this situation, the National Cotton Textile Conference discussed the "management standards" (economic and technical norms) and the improvement of factory management, which is entirely correct.

　　Formulating complete economic and technical quotas for the cotton textile industry requires a considerable period of time. This is a meticulous and complex task that requires continuous actual measurement, absorbing numerous experiences, and summarizing more work. However, as a preliminary foundation, stipulating standards for raw materials, quality and specifications of finished products, as well as quotas for the number of employees in large and small factories, as the direction of management, is possible and necessary. This cotton textile conference discussed and revised the yarn and cloth management standards drafted at the March conference last year, and made clearer regulations on the main shortcomings in technical management over the past year: adding a finished yarn and cloth inspection system to promote the improvement of finished product quality, as a basis for business management, in order to assess the merits of factory performance, is entirely necessary. The management standards further stipulate the shift handover system, preservation system and operation regulations, which is a very important supplement to the work of production technology management in the future.

　　The "management standards" also fully take care of small and medium-sized factories, so they are relatively easy to implement. After the March conference, various places have tried out the "yarn and cloth management standards" and achieved some results, enabling the implementing manufacturers to have clear guidelines in terms of finished product quality. There has also been a certain direction in terms of staffing. The revised management standards do not change much from the standards at that time, which means that implementation is entirely possible. For factories that have always been poorly managed, the management standards will be the goal of improving and raising their technical management.

　　In terms of factory management, in order to do a good job in production, it is almost unanimously believed that the responsibility system should be universally established in public and private factories. The so-called responsibility system means that everyone is responsible for things, and everything is responsible by someone. In 1950, there was great progress in factory management, but the fact that there were things that people dared not manage, were unwilling to manage, and were not managed was quite serious. Therefore, phenomena of waste and lax discipline were still quite common. Only factories that have established a responsibility system, such as a few factories in Northeast China, Tianjin, and Qingdao, have begun to see improvements. This proves that: establishing the responsibility system is the central link in improving production management.

　　Our responsibility system is based on the conscious and voluntary basis of the masses, that is, on the basis of democratic management. In state-owned factories, it is based on the factory management committee, and in private factories, it is based on labor-capital consultation meetings. Precisely because it is built on a democratic foundation, it requires everyone to be responsible for production. Being responsible for production is being responsible to the country and the people. Therefore, the production responsibility system is a democratic management system in which everyone is responsible for production and also responsible to the country and the people. Therefore, our responsibility system is essentially different from the bureaucratic capitalist management system of capitalism.

　　To require everyone to take on certain responsibilities, it is necessary to clarify what responsibilities each employee should take, and how to be responsible. In other words, it is necessary to specifically stipulate the duties and tasks of employees, so that everyone can have clear responsibilities to take. At the same time, in order to encourage the advanced and educate the backward, the responsibility system also needs to be supplemented by a necessary reward and punishment system.

　　To be responsible, of course, should first take responsibility from the leadership, and establish a responsible system in the leadership. In state-owned textile factories, this first requires the administrative负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) – the factory director – to take responsibility. In private textile factories, this first requires the负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) of the capitalist – the manager, the factory director – to take responsibility. Only when the leadership takes the lead and takes responsibility first can the responsibility system of all employees be established.

　　The responsibility system is such a system that is closely related to every employee. It is bound to be a mass movement, and it is also a regular task. In this way, there is no doubt that to do it well, it cannot be completed solely by the administration or the capitalist, but must be launched by the Party, the League, and the Trade Union in a concerted step; to do it well, it is not a sudden campaign, but a long-term work.

　　In the process, of course, it should still be carried out step by step and with a plan. Every factory has its own characteristics, and every factory also has different main shortcomings. And the main shortcomings should be solved first, and the main responsibility system should be established. At present, among textile factories, the main problems are poor quality, many accidents, and high costs. Therefore, a quality system, a safety system, and a cost system should be established first. But it should still be based on the specific circumstances of each region, distinguishing between priority. Due to the different times of liberation and the degree of factory concentration in various regions, it is impossible to force uniformity. Therefore, it is entirely correct to recognize this issue ideologically and determine it in principle, formulate specific measures in accordance with the specific conditions in various places, and proceed in stages.

　　The coordination of the management and technical aspects with the production plan makes the realization of our country's 1951 cotton textile industry plan even more guaranteed. This also makes the cotton textile industry one of the powerful backbones for safeguarding the people's livelihood and supporting the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the country.

　　棉纺织工业进入新阶段
    俞鲤庭
    一
    随着全国财经状况的好转，带来了棉纺织工业的好转局面。
    去年八月以后，由于全国各地丰收，人民的购买力普遍提高，纱布需要量激增，给棉纺织工业带来了扩大的市场。九、十月间，跟着全国棉花丰收，产量超过一九四九年百分之五十六，棉纺织工业所需要的原料，基本上获得了自给。这样，花纱的比价开始趋于正常状态，代纺的工缴也作了适当的调整，经过了初步改造的公私营棉纺织工业已都可以获得了相当的利润，于是棉纺织工业就迅速地从勉力维持的状态，转入全面恢复。去年十月前后，全国各地暂时停工疏散的工厂，都已在各地人民政府的帮助之下，先后全部复工。华北、中南、西北等产棉区的厂家，开始陆续增添新的设备。为了适应全国人民的需要，从十月份起，在全国范围内，一律开工六天六夜。十月至十一月间，国营棉纺织厂和部分给国家代纺的厂家，并且进行了增产运动。这一个增产运动获得了重大的成就。由于各地职工的热烈响应，忘我的劳动，产量都大大地超过了预定计划。单以上海、天津、青岛三地国营工厂来说，平均已超过预定计划百分之一九·○三。这样，截至十一月底止，全国国营工厂已提前一个月完成了一九五○年的全年计划。棉纱提前完成了全年计划的百分之一○一·四四，棉布提前完成了全年计划的百分之一○○·六九。以去年一月至十月的实际产量和十一及十二两月的计划产量并计，去年全国公私营棉纺织厂可完成去年初的预定计划百分之一一八。这个数字相当于战前最高年产量（一九三○年）的百分之九十七，比抗战前一年（一九三六年）则要超过百分之十四！这就是说，从中央人民政府成立至今的一年间，棉纺织工业已经迅速恢复到二十年前的最高产量。
            二
    按照现在的产量，是大致可能符合当前的需求的。但如果从发展的观点看，要以去年的实际产量作为今年的计划产量，无疑地将无法满足一九五一年全国人民的需要。为了供应全国人民今年的需要，就必须将纱布的产量适当的提高。根据这一现实情况，全国棉纺织会议一致同意一九五一年的方针，应当是：“提高生产，改善管理，重点建设，稳步发展”。这一方针是完全正确的。全国棉纺织会议又根据这一方针，按照市场需要和原料供应，初步确定了一九五一年的生产计划。这一计划将比一九五○年的预计产量增加百分之三十三，比战前最高年产量超过百分之二十八；比一九三六年的产量则将超过百分之五○·六。这将是中国棉纺织工业有史以来的最高产量！
    经过了这次会议，棉纺织工业已踏入了它的新阶段——发展的阶段。
    完成这样的一个巨大的计划数字，需要组织现有一切的力量，适当地增添新的设备。
    全国棉纺织会议曾经将这个计划，具体地分配到大行政区和各主要地区。
    过去一年间，曾经制订了全国公私营生产计划，但限于实际情况，计划还只是在国营工厂中间和个别地区的私营工厂中曾有意识地实行。一年来的经验证明，按照计划进行生产，对于国家和每个工厂都有极大好处。国家借此了解和掌握全国的原料成品，使纺织工业走上正规生产。对于每一个工厂而言，有了计划，这就有了经营的具体方向。
    过去我们有过为了争取代纺加工的较高计划，有过为了易于完成生产的较低计划。而这次的计划是根据各地的设备数和真实的生产效率而制订的。对于各地的工厂，都是具体可行的。贯彻和保证执行这个计划，就是保证有足够的纱布以供应全国人民的需要。
    要完成这个巨大计划，需要让每一个参与实际生产的职工，都能了解计划。每一个工厂，一方面要对敌人和与工作无关的人，保守国家的秘密，另方面也一定要使职工群众能够充分认识本厂本车间计划的重要性和它实际的情况。两者结合起来，然后计划才能成为实际行动的指针。
            三
    实现这样的巨大计划，还需要技术方面和管理方面的配合。没有这两方面的很好配合，计划也将难以有保证的实现。鉴于这种情况，全国棉纺织会议讨论了“经营标准”（经济技术定额），和工厂管理的改进，这是完全正确的。
    制订完备的棉纺织工业的各种经济技术定额需要有一个相当长的时期，这是一件细致而复杂的工作，需要不断进行实际的测定，吸收众多的经验，总结更多的工作。但是作为一个初步的基础，规定出原料的标准，成品的品质、规格，以及大小型工厂职工人数的定额等等，作为经营的方向，那是可能，而且也是必要的。这次棉纺织会议讨论和修正了去年三月会议所草定的纱布经营标准，对一年来技术管理中间的主要缺点，作了较明确的规定：增加了纱布成品检验制度，以促进成品品质的改进，作为业务管理上的依据，借以考核工厂成绩的优劣，是完全必要的。经营标准中进一步订定了交接班制度，保全制度和运转规定，对于今后生产技术管理的工作，是一个很重要的补充。
    “经营标准”，又充分照顾了中小型工厂，因此是比较容易执行的。三月会议之后，各地曾经试行“纱布经营标准”，取得了一些成绩，使执行的厂家在成品品质方面有了明确的准绳。在定员方面，也有了一定的方向。经过了修订的经营标准，对当时的标准变更不大，这就是说，执行是完全可能的。对于一向经营较差的工厂，经营标准将是改善和提高他们技术管理的目标。
    在工厂管理方面，为了搞好生产，几乎一致认为应当在公私营工厂中普遍建立责任制度。所谓责任制度，即是人人对事负责，事事有人负责。一九五○年内，工厂管理是有很大进步的，但不敢管不愿管不受管的事实是相当严重的，因此，浪费现象、纪律松懈现象，仍然相当普遍。只有建立了责任制度的工厂如东北、津、青的少数厂情况才开始有了改善。这就证明了：建立责任制度是改善生产管理的中心环节。
    我们的责任制度是建立在群众自觉自愿的基础上的，即是在民主管理的基础上的。在国营工厂中，它是以工厂管理委员会为基础的，在私营工厂中，它是以劳资协商会议为基础的。正是因为它是建筑在民主的基础上，它就要求人人对生产负起责任。对生产负责，即是对国家负责，对人民负责。因此生产责任制是人人对生产也是对国家对人民负责的民主管理制度。所以我们的责任制度与资本主义的官僚资本主义的管理制度有本质上的不同。
    要求每一个人负起一定的职责，这就要分清每一个职工要负些什么责任？要如何负责？换句话说，要具体订立职工的职责任务，使人人能有明确的责任可负。同时，为了鼓励先进、教育落后，责任制度还需要辅以必要的奖惩制度。
    要负责，当然首先应该从领导上负起责任，在领导上建立起负责制度。在国营纺织厂这就首先要求行政上的负责人——厂长负起责任。在私营纺织厂，这就首先要求资方的负责人——经理、厂长负起责任。只有领导上以身作则，首先负责，然后才能建立全体职工的责任制度。
    责任制度就是这样与职工人人有密切关连的制度，它必然是一个群众性的运动，而且也是一个经常的任务。这样，就无疑地，要搞好它，就不是行政或资方所能单独完成，而必须发动党、团、工会步调一致地来合力推动；要搞好它，就不是一个突击的运动，而是长期的工作。
    在进行中间，当然还是应当有步骤，有计划。每一个工厂有每一个工厂的特点，也有每一个工厂不同的主要缺点。而首先应当解决主要的缺点，建立主要的责任制度。目前在纺织工厂中间，主要是质量坏，事故多，成本高，因此应当首先建立质量制度，安全制度，和成本制度。但也还是应当按照各地区的各别情况，分别先后。各地的纺织工业由于解放时期的迟早和工厂集中的程度不同，不可能强求一致，因此从思想上认识和从原则上确定这一问题，按照各地具体情况，订出各别的具体办法，分期进行，是完全正确的。
    从管理方面技术方面配合生产计划，使我们国家一九五一年的棉纺织业计划的实现更增加了保证。这也就是使棉纺织工业成为保障人民生活，支援抗美援朝保家卫国的有力后盾之一。
