　　Fur Company Massively Purchased Wool and Down Last Year
    Living Standards of People in Northwest Pastoral Areas Gradually Improve
    Total Annual Purchase Value Equivalent to Nearly One Billion Jin of Wheat
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Thanks to the development of trade, the lives of ethnic minorities in the Northwest pastoral areas have improved. After the extensive development of urban-rural trade across the country, new urban-rural relationships have been established between cities such as Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan, and Pingliang in the Northwest and the vast pastoral areas. Herders transport wool to the cities in exchange for essential fabrics, grains, tea, and other items. The Golok people of Bayan Har Mountain in Qinghai, who had been isolated from the inland for thirty-two years, also transported over nine thousand jin of wool to Jiyuan County in Qinghai Province for the first time at the end of last year, exchanging it for over seven hundred bags of grain, one hundred bolts of cloth, and over fifty packages of Fucha tea. Through reasonable exchange, herders are gradually shaking off the poverty caused by reactionary rule and embarking on a path of freedom and happiness. In joy, they sing poems praising Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, like the sun, warmly shines on people..." They enthusiastically support the People's Government. They believe that the correct trade policies of the People's Government have brought them happiness.
    In the past, minority areas of Qinghai were subject to the cruel exploitation, plunder, and devastation of the Ma bandits. Trade was stagnant, and the herders' wool became waste, plunging the people of these areas into an abyss of poverty. After liberation, state-owned trading companies purchased wool in large quantities at reasonable prices, turning the herders' waste into wealth. According to incomplete statistics, the Northwest Fur Company purchased over 16.87 million jin of wool, over 19,200 jin of cashmere, over 130,000 jin of camel hair, and goat skins, casings, and other items last year alone. Based on current prices, the total value of wool and other products sold by herders can be exchanged for 977.782 million jin of wheat or over 640,000 bolts of forty-yard cloth. After receiving this large income, the Northwest herders not only laid the foundation for their future production development but also improved their living standards. For example, the Golok people living in Bayan Har Mountain, having sold wool at reasonable prices and exchanged it for grain, no longer drink animal blood or eat wild grass like savages. People in pastoral areas who used to always wear old sheepskin coats, have now donned cloth clothing; flower tribute cloth and blue serge are the most popular and fastest-selling items. Before the liberation of Dihua City, private merchants brought in no more than one thousand bolts of cloth into the city each month. Last year, the average monthly volume increased to over 35,000 bolts. In Xining City, from liberation to September of last year, the number of department stores increased from 368 to 687. All of this indicates that the people in the pastoral areas are gradually shaking off a life of poverty. (Ding Feng, Tian Nong)

　　皮毛公司去年大量收购毛绒
    西北牧区人民生活逐渐改善
    全年收购总值折合小麦近十亿斤
    【本报讯】西北牧区少数民族人民已因贸易发展，生活得到改善。全国各地广泛展开城乡贸易后，西北区西安、兰州、西宁、银川、平凉等城市和辽阔的牧区已建立起新的城乡关系，牧区人民把羊毛运到城市换回他们所必需的布匹、粮食、茶叶等。曾和内地隔绝三十二年的青海巴颜喀喇山的果洛族，在去年底也第一次把九千余斤羊毛运到青海省的潟源县，换回七百多袋粮食，一百多匹布和五十余封茯茶。牧区人民通过合理的交换，正逐渐摆脱了由于反动统治而造成的贫困，开始走上自由、幸福的道路。他们在欢欣中，唱出歌颂毛主席的诗：“毛主席，像太阳，暖烘烘地照在人身上……”，他们热烈地拥护人民政府。他们认为人民政府正确的贸易政策，使他们得到了幸福。
    青海少数民族地区，过去在马匪残酷的压榨、掠夺和摧残下，交易滞塞，牧民的羊毛因而变成废物，致使这些地区的人民生活陷于贫困的深渊。在解放以后，国营贸易公司用合理的价格，大量收购羊毛，牧区人民的废物已变成财富。据不完全统计，去年一年中，西北区皮毛公司共收购羊毛一千六百八十七万余斤；羊绒一万九千二百余斤；驼毛十三万余斤及山羊板皮、肠衣等。照目前的价格计算，牧区人民出售羊毛等收入的总值，能换小麦九亿七千七百八十二万余斤或是四十码的布六十四万余匹。西北牧区人民得到有史以来的一笔大收入后，不仅奠定了他们今后发展生产的基础，并且改善了牧区人民的生活。如住在巴颜喀喇山的果洛族，由于合理价格卖出羊毛，换回粮食，再不像野人一样喝畜血、吃野草了。过去老是穿老羊皮袄的，现在在没有国营贸易公司地方的牧区人民，已经穿上布衣服了，销售花贡呢、青斜纹是最多也最快。迪化市解放前私商每月运进城的布匹最多没有超过一千匹，去年平均每月已增加到三万五千匹以上；西宁市从解放后到去年九月，百货业已由三百六十八户增加到了六百八十七户。这些都说明了牧区人民已逐步摆脱着贫苦的生活。（丁风、田农）
