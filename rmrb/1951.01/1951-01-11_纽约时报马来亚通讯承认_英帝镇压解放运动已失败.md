　　Xinhua News Agency, Tenth Dispatch: A "New York Times" correspondent in Malaya recently wrote several dispatches to the newspaper admitting that the British plan to suppress the Malayan liberation movement has failed. The newspaper's reporter said that the war has reached a state of "de facto stalemate." The newspaper admitted that the plan devised by British Malayan Commander Briggs to relocate residents near the jungle to areas under direct police surveillance has encountered unexpected difficulties. In these "new villages," the "cell organizations" of the liberation movement have been established. The liberation movement is thus advancing closer to British military towns and strongholds. On the other hand, behind the British military front lines, guerrillas continue to be active. The newspaper also wrote: "They have demonstrated greater skill in various attacks, such as sabotage and attacking trains."

　　纽约时报马来亚通讯承认
    英帝镇压解放运动已失败
    【新华社十日讯】通电社纽约讯：“纽约时报”驻马来亚记者最近写给该报的几篇通讯中承认：英国镇压马来亚解放运动的计划已告失败。该报记者说：战事已达到“事实上僵持”的状态。该报承认：马来亚英军司令布里格斯所订的计划，即把接近密林的居民迁移至警察直接监视之下的计划，已遇到意外的困难。在这些“新村”中，解放运动的“细胞组织”已经建立起来。解放运动便推进得更接近英军的城镇据点了。另一方面，在英军战线的后方，游击队正继续活跃。该报并写道：“他们在破坏和袭击火车等多种多样的攻击中，表现出他们发展了更大的技能。”
