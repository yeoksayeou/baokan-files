　　Lingnan University in Guangzhou Stands Up
    Ai Wen
    I. Such "Traditional Friendship"!
    Lingnan University is one of the "educational undertakings" of American imperialism in China. As everyone knows, the reason why American imperialism engages in educational undertakings in China is to carry out cultural aggression and expand its spiritual influence. The predecessor of Lingnan University was the Gezhi Academy (Canton Christian Collage) founded in 1888 by the American missionary A.P. Happer. Happer and the American clergyman B. C. Henry served as presidents successively. It was not until after the famous Hong Kong general strike that the American imperialist elements were shocked by the patriotic actions of the Chinese people and had to nominally hand over the school to the Chinese, renaming it Lingnan University, with Zhong Rongguang as the president. However, it was still actually controlled by American advisors.
    American imperialist elements have always unreasonably oppressed the students of Lingnan University. As early as one night in August 1914, the students of the Lingnan University Affiliated High School went to the Science Hall to listen to a lecture by Mr. Pauling Liu (an American imperialist element), the director of the History and Political Science Department, and were unreasonably rejected by Pauling. The students surrounded the Science Hall and were beaten as a result. The entomarium of Professor He Fumin of the American imperialist element Biology Department was a "forbidden area" of Lingnan University, and no one was allowed to enter. The students called it the "concession of Lingnan." If students were doing field research work in the entomarium, or if neighboring children were picking up dead branches nearby, He Fumin would shout "Get out!" and even punch and kick them away. Pauling often suppressed progressive opinions and tore up the students' wall posters. The American imperialist element Xiang Yage, who served as the principal's advisor of the school, served as the captain of the Fourteenth Air Force and as an advisor to Song Ziwen. He was once named an "Honorary Citizen of Guangzhou" by the Kuomintang reactionary government. The shameless crimes of this "honorary citizen" are truly unspeakable. This beast in clothing not only raped the female relatives of workers on campus, but also plundered the land of farmers off campus. In the early years of the Republic of China, Xiang Yage colluded with the local bully warlord Li Fulin to plunder more than 700 mu of hillside land from farmers. There were many graves on the hillside, and he used the Chinese reactionary army to point guns at the farmers and force them to dig up the graves. More than 10,000 villagers from 72 villages carried the remains to the then Grand Marshal's Office to petition, but to no avail. More than 700 mu of land was plundered by Xiang Yage. This is the "traditional friendship" of American imperialism towards the Chinese people!
    II. The "Education" American Imperialism Gives to Chinese Youth!
    American imperialism attempts to "educate" Chinese youth to forget their motherland and worship the decadent "American way of life." American imperialist element Lu Kaohuo once openly declared: "Taiwan is not Chinese, it is Japanese and should be jointly administered by the United Nations." He specializes in using pornographic books to poison students, using articles depicting love killings and fights, as well as propaganda from the United States Information Service, as his English teaching materials. Father Han Dehui, known as the Flowery Monk, had a house that combined dance halls and casinos, decorated with nude photos and reactionary books. He used bridge, cigarettes, alcohol, etc. to lure and numb the students. This is what they boast about as "civilization."
    The absurd arguments of American imperialist elements at Lingnan University are endless. Pauling, who served as the director of the History and Political Science Department for decades, said: "The Treaty of Tianjin is not an unequal treaty forced on China by imperialism." When the just movement to resist America and aid Korea was launched at Lingnan, the students explained to the American professor Lao Enci that the Chinese people opposed the American imperialists, not the American people. He said: "The United States is not imperialist, it is the United Nations that is invading Korea." At a banquet last semester, Lu Kaohuo openly accused Zhong Yijun, a professor of the Department of Political Science, saying: "The Communist Party is wrong, and you have corrupted our people (referring to the professor of the Foreign Language Department). You are on the wrong side." When Mr. Zhong Yijun protested to him and explained his position, he said: "We will win because we have the atomic bomb."
    Before liberation, the suffering of the students of Lingnan University was unimaginable. Even the language of the motherland was forbidden. Around 1921, it was forbidden to speak Chinese on the Lingnan campus. Speaking a sentence of Chinese would result in a penalty of carrying a gun. The ban was only lifted on Saturdays and holidays. All official documents, textbooks, and meetings were in English. In 1938, Lu Kaohuo gave a speech saying: "English in China is not a foreign language," and also said: "Colored people are a burden to white people." Many students were forced to leave the school because their English was not good! Zhang Zhucang, a student in the Chemistry Department, was very good at chemistry, but his English was not very good, and he was not allowed to take the major course in his third year. Chen Jiaxuan did not receive a scholarship because his English was not good. This is the "educational undertaking" of American imperialism in China!
    At Lingnan University, scientific research was subject to various restrictions. Zhou Yuxiu, a student, discovered a pest that damages citrus fruits and requested Mr. Jialisi, an American professor in the Biology Department, to study it, but was unreasonably refused: "I am not interested in studying it because we do not have such pests in California." How did this Jialisi conduct his "research work"? Under the pretext of collecting specimens, he had been to Xikang, Sichuan, Taiwan and other places to measure and photograph China's terrain and mines; he transferred the results of his research on insects and the collected specimens to the United States through Hong Kong. Once, the younger brother of the worker Liu Bangxin was transporting materials for him to Hong Kong. During the inspection on the way, he accidentally dropped these illegal materials into the river. After returning to school, he was threatened into becoming mentally ill. This is enough to prove the purpose of their "scientific research."
    From the job distribution of graduates of Lingnan University, we can see who this university "cultivates" talents for. According to a survey in 1949, there were a total of 2,333 old Lingnan students; 832 worked in Guangzhou; 83 worked in other parts of China; 864 worked in Hong Kong and Macau; 472 in various parts of Southeast Asia (192 in Singapore alone); and 82 in the United States. Among the 120 graduates last year, only 20 accepted jobs assigned by the People's Government. From this statistics, it is obvious that the talents "cultivated" by Lingnan under the control of American imperialism are too few who truly serve the Chinese people.
    III. Lingnan Overturns
    "American Imperialism Falls! Lingnan Stands Up!" This powerful slogan has resounded throughout Guangzhou. The teachers, students and staff of Lingnan University have destroyed a fortress of American cultural aggression, and the people's Lingnan has been born. On December 14, 1950, a conference was held at Huaitu Garden of the school to denounce American imperialism, and the anger buried in the hearts of the people for many years was ignited. The crimes of American imperialism were exposed. One day was not enough to finish the accusations, and the meeting continued the next day. At the request of all the students, the presidium called out Fulun (representative of the American Fund Committee of the school), an American imperialist element who manipulated Lingnan, and questioned him on the spot. His face turned from red to white, and then from white to red. The angry voices of the students made him tremble, and his former prestige was gone. The teachers, students, and staff who had shattered the shackles of American imperialism formed a steel team and marched in a mighty demonstration, shouting: "Down with American imperialism!" Sun Yat-sen University's Colleges of Arts, Sciences, Law, and Business, and Xiehe Middle School in Guangzhou all sent condolence teams to Lingnan University to express their condolences and said: "All of our students are determined to be your backing."

### 广州岭南大学站起来了

　　广州岭南大学站起来了
    艾文
    一、这样的“传统友谊”！
    岭南大学是美帝在中国的“教育事业”之一。大家知道：美帝国主义所以在中国举办教育事业，为的是进行文化侵略，扩大其精神上的影响。岭南大学的前身是美籍牧师哈巴（A.P. Happer）在一八八八年创办的格致书院（Canton Christian Collage），由哈巴和美籍教士香雅各（B. C. Henry）先后任院长。直到有名的香港大罢工之后，美帝国主义分子为中国人民的爱国行动所震慑，不得不把这所学校在表面上归中国人办，改称岭南大学，由钟荣光任校长，但实际上仍由美籍顾问控制校政。
    美帝国主义分子一直对岭大同学进行无理的压迫。远在一九一四年八月的一个晚上，岭大附中的同学们到科学馆听历史政治系主任包令留（美帝国主义分子）的讲演而受到包氏的无理拒绝。同学们包围科学馆，结果被殴打。美帝国主义分子生物系教授贺辅民的昆虫园是岭大的“禁地”，不准任何人进去，同学们称之为“岭南的租界”。如果有同学在昆虫园作实地研究工作或邻居小孩在附近收拾枯枝，贺辅民便大喊“滚出去！”甚至拳打脚踢，赶走他们。包令留经常压制进步的言论，撕毁同学们的壁报。做过该校校长顾问的美帝国主义分子香雅各，当过十四航空队大队长，做过宋子文的顾问，曾被国民党反动政府封为“广州荣誉市民”。这位“荣誉市民”的无耻罪行，真是一言难尽。这位衣冠禽兽非但在校内强奸工友们的女眷，而且在校外掠夺农民的土地。民国初年，香雅各勾结恶霸军阀李福林，掠夺农民七百余亩岗地。岗地上有许多坟，他利用中国反动军队，用枪口对着农民，强迫他们掘坟。七十二乡乡民万余人抬着尸骨到当时的大元帅府请愿，没有结果。七百余亩土地被香雅各掠夺去了。这就是美帝对中国人民的“传统友谊”！
  二、美帝给中国青年的“教育”！
    美帝企图“教育”中国青年忘掉自己的祖国，崇拜腐朽的“美国生活方式”。美帝国主义分子路考活曾公开声言过：“台湾不是中国的，它是日本的，应归联合国共管。”他专以色情的书籍来毒害同学，用描写情杀打斗的文章，以及美国新闻处的宣传品等做他的英文教材。有着花和尚称号的韩德辉神父，他的房子集舞场、赌场之大成，布置着裸体照片，反动书籍。他用桥牌、烟、酒等等来引诱同学，麻醉同学。这就是他们自夸的“文明”。
    美帝国主义分子在岭南大学的荒谬论调是说不完的。作了几十年历史政治系主任的包令留说：“天津条约不是帝国主义强迫中国订的不平等条约。”当抗美援朝的正义运动在岭南展开时，同学们向美籍教授老恩赐解释，中国人民反对的是美帝国主义者，而不是美国人民，他说：“美国不是帝国主义，侵朝的是联合国。”在上学期的一个宴会上，路考活竟公开指责政治系教授钟一钧说：“共产党是不对的，而你竟把我们的人（指外文系教授）教坏了，你是站在错的一面。”当钟一钧先生向他抗议，并说明自己的立场时，他又说：“我们会胜利的，因为有原子弹。”
    解放以前，岭南大学同学所受的痛苦是不可想像的，连祖国的语言都被禁用。一九二一年左右，岭南校内不许人说中国话，说一句中国话便要罚托枪，只有星期六及假日才开禁。校内一切来往公文，各科教本都用英文；大小会议，必用英语。一九三八年路考活发表讲演说：“英文在中国，不是外国语”，又说：“有色人种给白种人以负担”。多少同学因为英文不好，而被迫离校！化学系张注苍同学化学很好，但英文不大好，在三年级时不让他修主修课程。陈家暄同学因为英文不好，而得不到助学金。这就是美帝国主义在中国的“教育事业”！
    在岭南大学，科学研究受着种种限制。周毓秀同学发现了一种损害柑橘的害虫，请求生物系美籍教授嘉理思加以研究，但遭到了无理的拒绝：“我没有兴趣研究，因为我们加里福尼亚州没有此类害虫。”这位嘉理思怎样进行其“研究工作”呢？他以搜集标本为名，曾到过西康、四川、台湾等地测量与拍摄中国的地形和矿山；他把他们研究昆虫的成绩和搜集到的标本，通过香港转运美国。有一次，工友刘帮信的弟弟给他运送材料到香港，在半途被检查时，因为不慎把这违法的材料丢在河里，回校后竟被他们恐吓成神经病。这足以证明他们的“科学研究”的目的何在了。
    从岭南大学毕业同学的工作分配上，我们可以看出：这个大学到底替谁“培养”人材？据一九四九年的调查，岭南旧同学共二三三三人；在广州工作的八三二人；在国内其他各地工作的八三人；在香港、澳门工作的有八六四人；南洋各地四七二人（仅新加坡即有一九二人）；美国八二人。去年毕业同学一二○人中，接受人民政府分配工作的仅二○人。从这个统计上看，很明显地，在美帝控制下的岭南所“培养”出来的人材，真正为中国人民服务的太少了。
  三、岭南翻身了
    “美帝倒下去！岭南站起来！”这有力的口号已响彻广州。岭南大学的师生员工们摧毁了美帝文化侵略的一个堡垒，人民的岭大从此诞生了。一九五○年十二月十四日在该校怀土园召开了控诉美帝大会，多少年埋藏在人民心中的怒火燃烧起来了。美帝的罪行被揭发了，一天诉不完，第二天又继续开会。主席团应全体同学的要求，叫了操纵岭南的美帝国主义分子富伦（该校美国基金委员会代表）出来，当场加以质问。他的面色由红转白，又由白转红。同学们愤怒的声音使他颤抖了，昔日的威风没有了。粉碎了美帝国主义枷锁的师生员工们，结成钢铁的队伍，浩浩荡荡游行示威，高喊：“打倒美帝国主义！”广州市的中山大学文理法商学院，协和中学等校，都派慰问队到岭大来慰问，并表示：“我们全体同学决心作你们后盾”。
