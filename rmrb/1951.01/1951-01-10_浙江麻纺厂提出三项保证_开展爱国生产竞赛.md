Zhejiang Linen Mill Pledges Three Guarantees
Launches Patriotic Production Competition
To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:

We, the Zhejiang Linen Mill, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, began construction in October 1949, and some machines started production on August 1, 1950. In less than half a year since production began, thanks to the leadership of higher authorities and the efforts of all employees, we not only achieved product quality that met or even exceeded national standards in some areas, but also set a new record of 300 yards per ten hours for individual looms in terms of output. Moreover, we have made many innovations and improvements in technology, such as converting ordinary looms into circular looms and modifying the degumming process for ramie. Just as we were working diligently in the embrace of the motherland and the big family of the working class, for the cause of national peaceful construction and a more prosperous and free life in the future, American imperialism brazenly launched a war, invaded Korea and Taiwan, attempting to enslave our entire people and destroy our national construction. All of our employees held a grand and solemn anti-American and aid-Korea oath-taking rally with unparalleled anger. We sincerely propose three guarantees to you as our practical actions to resist America and aid Korea:

(1) Launch a patriotic production competition, overcome extravagance and waste, practice careful calculation and strict budgeting, require no investment from higher authorities, and guarantee self-reliance to complete the glorious and arduous task of doubling the number of machines next year.

(2) Abolish the old annual bonus system. Implement the new production incentive system promulgated by the Industry Department. Starting from January 1st, implement the Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by the Central Government Administration Council on a trial basis.

(3) Guarantee an average annual output of 250 yards per loom (per ten hours) for the entire year of 1951 and reduce costs by 5 percent. Cultivate more labor heroes and production models.

Respectfully, we offer our highest class salute.
		Anti-American and Aid-Korea Oath-Taking Rally of All Employees of the State-Owned Zhejiang Linen Mill

　　浙江麻纺厂提出三项保证
    开展爱国生产竞赛中央人民政府毛主席：
    我们浙江麻纺织厂，在共产党和浙江省人民政府领导下，从一九四九年十月开始建厂，一九五○年八一节部分机器开车生产。在这生产后不到半年的时间，由于上级的领导和全体职工的努力，不但争取产品质量达到甚至部分超过了全国标准；产量方面也创造了个别布机每十小时三百码的新纪录。而且在技术上有了不少的创造和改进。如原布机改装圆筒布机，改造了布机克拉子鲜麻皮脱胶等。当我们正在祖国怀抱和工人阶级的大家庭里，为国家和平建设事业及将来更幸福的自由生活，而紧张工作着的时候，美帝国主义竟冒险发动战争，侵略朝鲜和台湾，企图奴役我全国人民，破坏我国家建设。我们全厂职工以无比的愤怒举行隆重和严肃的抗美援朝宣誓大会。我们诚恳地向你提出三项保证，作为我们抗美援朝的实际行动：
    （一）开展爱国主义生产竞赛，克服铺张浪费。精打细算，不要上级投资，保证自力更生，完成明年扩大一倍机器的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    （二）废除旧的年奖制度。执行工业厅颁布的新的生产奖励制度。自一月一日试行中央政务院公布的劳动保险条例。
    （三）保证一九五一年全年平均产量至二五○码（每台布机十小时）及降低成本百分之五。培养出更多的劳动英雄与生产模范。
    谨致崇高的阶级敬礼
              国营浙江麻纺织厂全体职工抗美援朝宣誓大会
