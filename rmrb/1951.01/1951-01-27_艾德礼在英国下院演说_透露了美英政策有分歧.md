Xinhua News Agency, London, January 25th (TASS): British Prime Minister Attlee, in an address to the House of Commons on the 23rd, discussed the Chinese People's Government's response to the "Three-Man Committee's" supplementary report on the Korean ceasefire conditions. Attlee defended the Labour government's policy on the Korean issue. Attlee said, "The reply from the Chinese side received on January 17th, while most disappointing, did not finally close the door to negotiations." Attlee repeatedly accused the People's Republic of China. He said: The British government agrees with the US condemnation of China, but he added, "We do not believe that the time has come to consider further measures."
    During Attlee's address, Churchill interjected, demanding that serious divisions between British and American policies be avoided. Labour MP, Mr. Smith interrupted Churchill's interjection, saying, "We don't want to be dragged into war." Labour MPs supported this, and many parliamentary correspondents emphasized this in their reports.
    The *Workers' Daily's* parliamentary correspondent commented: MPs believe Attlee's statement is a manifestation of differences between the US and British governments. The correspondent also said: "Attlee's statement, as well as the attitudes of those Labour MPs who have recently been in contact with public opinion in their own constituencies, indicate that there is great pressure from all over the country against taking any steps that would seem to force Britain to participate in a war against China."

　　艾德礼在英国下院演说
    透露了美英政策有分歧
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十五日讯：英国首相艾德礼于二十三日在下院致辞时，论述了中国人民政府对于“三人委员会”的补充报告书内所提关于朝鲜停火条件的答复。艾德礼替工党政府在朝鲜问题上的政策辩护。艾德礼说：“一月十七日得到的中国方面的答复，虽然是最令人失望的，但并不曾把谈判的门终于关闭起来。”艾德礼反复诬控中华人民共和国，他说：英国政府赞同美国谴责中国案，但是，他又补充一句说：“我们并不认为考虑更进一步措施的时间已经到来。”
    在艾德礼致词时，邱吉尔曾插言，要求力避英美两国政策间发生严重分歧，工党议员施米斯打断了邱吉尔的插言，他说：“我们不要被人拉进战争中去。”工党议员们都予以支持，许多议会访员们对于此事都着重予以报道。
    《工人日报》议会访员评称：议员们认为艾德礼的声明是美英两国政府之间发生分歧的表现。该访员又称：“艾德礼的声明以及新近在自己的选区中与舆论界保持接触的那些工党议员们的态度，表明了正有一种极大的压力来自全国各地，反对采取似将迫使英国参加对中国战争的任何步骤。”
