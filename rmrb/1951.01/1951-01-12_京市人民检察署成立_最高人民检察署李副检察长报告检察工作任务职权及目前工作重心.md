　　Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate Established
    Deputy Procurator-General Li of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Reports on Procuratorial Work Tasks, Powers, and Current Work Focus

    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate held its inauguration ceremony on the afternoon of the 3rd. Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court of the Central Government; Li Liuru and Lan Gongwu, Deputy Procurators-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate; Peng Zemin, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council; Pan Zhenya, Deputy Director of the Supervisory Committee; Chen Jinkun, Deputy Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission; Wang Feiran, President of the Beijing Municipal Court; and Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, all attended the meeting. After Feng Jiping, concurrently Deputy Procurator-General of the Procuratorate, announced the opening of the meeting, Deputy Procurator-General Li of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government gave a relatively detailed speech on the tasks, powers, and current work focus of procuratorial work. He first pointed out that the people's procuracy is a new system in the new China, and it is essentially different from the procuratorial work in capitalist countries and old China. He said: "The procuracy in capitalist countries is for the sake of a few reactionary ruling classes, facilitating the exploitation and suppression of the oppressed classes. Therefore, its only task is to prosecute and bring public charges in criminal matters, and it does not concern itself with other matters. Its organization is placed within the courts at all levels, and it is merely an accomplice to the courts in oppressing the people. The procuratorial work in old China was also like this." Regarding the tasks of the people's procuratorial work, he said: "The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government, in accordance with Articles 5 and 28 of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government, bears the highest responsibility for the strict observance of laws by government organs, public servants, and the people of the whole country. Procuratorates at all levels throughout the country should, under the direct leadership of the Supreme Procuratorate and their superior procuratorates, and with the close assistance of local government organs, carry out the same work tasks." Regarding the powers of the procuratorate, he said: "The Supreme People's Procuratorate is under the direct jurisdiction of the Central People's Government Committee and directly exercises and leads subordinate procuratorates in performing the following powers: (1) To inspect whether government organs and public servants at all levels throughout the country and the people of the whole country abide by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and all laws, decrees, policies, and guidelines of the Central People's Government; (2) To file protests against illegal judgments of judicial organs at all levels; (3) To conduct investigations and file public charges in criminal cases; (4) To inspect illegal measures taken by judicial and public security organs, reformatories, and prisons throughout the country; (5) To represent the interests of the state in civil cases and all administrative lawsuits related to the interests of society and the working people throughout the country; (6) To handle requests for reconsideration from people who are dissatisfied with the decision of subordinate procuratorates not to prosecute." Regarding the current focus of work, he said: "The tasks of the people's procuracy are quite important and broad. However, today the procuratorial organs are just beginning to be established, with no foundation, like building a terrace on a flat ground. It is impossible to do everything well immediately. Based on the experience of the work of procuratorates at all levels over the past year, in order to cooperate with the current political tasks, procuratorial work should be carried out step by step and with emphasis. The main task at present should be placed on judicial procuratorial work, among which special emphasis should be placed on the inspection of various counter-revolutionary cases. The legality of judgments, arrests, and releases by public security and judicial organs, as well as major cases of illegal activities and violations of discipline by public servants, should also be inspected."

    Subsequently, Deputy Procurator-General Lan Gongwu, President Shen Junru, Deputy Director Pan Zhenya, Deputy Director Chen Jinkun, and Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu spoke in succession, making detailed analyses of the importance of procuratorial work and its close relationship with public security, judicial, and supervisory organs. Finally, Luo Ruiqing, concurrently Procurator-General of the Procuratorate, delivered a speech, emphasizing: "The procuratorial work of the new China should learn from the Soviet Union, reject capitalism, and create its own new procuratorial work." He also expressed that under the direct leadership of the superior procuratorate, he is confident and certain of doing this new work well.

    [Another News Item] The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government held its sixth meeting of the Procuratorial Committee two days before the end of 1950. The heads of judicial, public security, supervisory, and legal committees were also invited to attend. At the meeting, Deputy Procurator-General Li Liuru reported on the general situation and achievements of procuratorial work over the past year, and discussed the trial organizational rules for procuratorates at all levels and the list of appointments and removals of personnel from procuratorates at all levels.

　　京市人民检察署成立
    最高人民检察署李副检察长报告检察工作任务职权及目前工作重心
    【本报讯】北京市人民检察署于三日下午举行成立典礼，中央最高人民法院沈钧儒院长、最高人民检察署李六如、蓝公武两副检察长、政务院政治法律委员会彭泽民副主任、监察委员会潘震亚副主任、法制委员会陈瑾昆副主任、北京市法院王斐然院长、市人民政府张友渔副市长均出席会议。该署兼副检察长冯基平主席宣布开会后，首由中央人民政府最高人民检察署李副检察长就检察工作的任务、职权、目前工作重心做比较详细的发言。他首先指出人民检察是新中国的新制度，它与资本主义国家及旧中国的检察工作有本质的区别。他说：“资本主义国家的检察是为了少数反动统治阶级，便于剥削和镇压被压迫阶级的，故其唯一的任务就是关于刑事方面的检举、公诉，不问其他；其组织是配置在各级法院里边，只是做法院压迫老百姓的帮手而已。旧中国的检察工作亦是如此。”对于人民检察工作的任务，他说：“中央人民政府最高人民检察署，依据中央人民政府组织法第五条及第二十八条的规定，它对于政府机关公务人员和全国国民之严格遵守法律，负有最高的检察责任，全国各级检察署则应在最高检察署及其上级检察署直接领导之下，在地方政府机关密切协助之下，来执行同样的工作任务。”关于检察署的职权，他说：“最高人民检察署受中央人民政府委员会直辖，直接行使并领导下级检察署执行下列职权：（一）检察全国各级政府机关及公务人员和全国国民是否遵守人民政协共同纲领及中央人民政府的一切法律、法令与政策方针；（二）对各级司法机关之违法判决提起控诉；（三）对刑事案件实施侦察提起公诉；（四）检察全国司法、公安机关犯人改造所及监所之违法措施；（五）对全国社会与劳动人民利益有关之民事案件及一切行政诉讼均得代表国家公益参与之；（六）处理人民不服下级检署不起诉之声请复议事件。”关于当前工作重心，他说：“人民检察的任务是相当重大而又广泛的，但是，今天检察机关方开始建立，毫无基础，等于平地起楼台，不可能马上事事都办好，根据各级检署一年来工作的经验，为配合当前政治任务，检察工作应该有步骤有重点地进行，目前的主要任务应放在司法检察方面，其中尤应着重检察各种反革命案件，对于公安、司法机关之判决与逮捕、释放是否合法，公务人员违法乱纪的重大案件，亦应进行检察。”
    继由蓝公武副检察长、沈钧儒院长、潘震亚副主任、陈瑾昆副主任、张友渔副市长相继发言，各就检察工作的重要性以及与公安、司法、监察等机关的密切关系，做了详尽的分析。最后该署罗瑞卿兼检察长致词，他强调指出：“新中国的检察工作，应该学习苏联的，拒绝资本主义的，创造自己的新的检察工作。”他并表示在上级检察署直接领导下，一定有把握有信心把这一新工作搞好。
    【又讯】中央人民政府最高人民检察署于一九五○年年终前二日举行了第六次检察委员会议，司法、公安、监察、法委等机关首长亦被邀列席，会议由李六如副检察长报告一年来检察工作概况及其成绩，讨论各级检察署试行组织通则及各级检察署人员任免名单。
