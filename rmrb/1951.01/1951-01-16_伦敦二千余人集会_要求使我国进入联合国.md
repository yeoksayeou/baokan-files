　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th: According to a Reuter's dispatch from London: A meeting attended by over two thousand people was held at Kingsway Hall, London, on the 9th. The meeting resolved to demand the entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, and to reaffirm the Cairo Declaration, which clearly stipulates that Taiwan belongs to China. The resolution stated: "Unless China joins the United Nations on an equal footing, no major Asian problem will be resolved."
　　Lord Stansgate, a Labour Party member of the Upper House and chairman of the meeting, emphasized in his speech: "There must be no war against China." He denounced the idea of ​​imposing an economic blockade on China as a "crazy plan." When he said, "The Chinese people have been under the rule of the West for many years, but they will no longer be under the rule of the West in the future. The Chinese people now have the best government they have had in many years," the audience erupted in cheers and applause. Reverend Henry Carter, chairman of the National Peace Council, demanded a change in Britain's current foreign policy in his speech. He questioned, "Can we reconsider the appropriate function of the United Nations as an institution for seeking reconciliation and peace?" His words were met with sustained applause from the audience.

　　伦敦二千余人集会
    要求使我国进入联合国
    【新华社十五日讯】据电通社伦敦讯：伦敦金斯威大厅于九日举行有两千多人参加的大会。大会决议要求使中华人民共和国进入联合国，要求重申明白规定台湾属于中国的开罗宣言。决议声称：“除非中国以平等地位加入联合国，任何有关亚洲的重大问题都不会得到解决。”
    大会主席上院工党议员斯坦斯盖特勋爵发表演说时强调指出：“决不能对中国作战”。他斥责对中国实施经济封锁的想法是一种“疯狂的计划”。当他说到“中国人民多年来始终处于西方的统治之下，但他们以后不再受西方的统治了。中国人民已有了多年以来从未有过的最好的政府”时，全场响彻了欢呼和鼓掌声。全国和平会议主席亨利·卡特牧师在发言中要求改变英国现行的外交政策，他质问：“我们能不能重新考虑一下作为谋致和解与和平的机构的联合国的适当的职能呢？”他的话受到听众们持久的掌声的响应。
