　　Letter from the Distribution Section of a Certain Department of the Revolutionary Military Commission:
    Porters Liu Changtai and Others Voluntarily Carry Comfort Goods
    On the afternoon of the 22nd of this month, more than 130 boxes of comfort goods for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army were shipped from Beijing West Railway Station. More than ten porters from the station's loading and unloading supply cooperative, led by group leader Liu Changtai, worked busily for an hour. Finally, Liu Changtai said on behalf of everyone, "Although our lives are still hard, everyone has contributed some money to support the volunteer soldiers at the front. Today, we will not charge for carrying these comfort goods, consider it as a small action of ours in resisting America and aiding Korea." This matter deeply moved everyone present.

　　革命军事委员会某部发行科来信：
    搬运工刘长太等义务搬运慰劳品
    本月二十二日下午，有一百三十余箱慰劳中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的慰劳品，在北京西站启运。该站装卸供应社的十余名搬运工人，在小组长刘长太的带动下，紧张地搬运了一个钟头。最后刘长太代表大伙说：“虽然我们生活还苦，可是大家都曾经凑了些钱支援前线的志愿军。今天搬运这些慰劳品，搬运费不要了，就算是我们在抗美援朝中的一点行动吧。”这件事情，深深地感动了在场的每个人。
