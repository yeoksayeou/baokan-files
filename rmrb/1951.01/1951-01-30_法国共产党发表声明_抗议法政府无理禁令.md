Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 29th: TASS reported from Paris: On the 27th, L'Humanité published a statement from the French Communist Party protesting the French government's decision to ban the activities of three major international democratic organizations in France, stating: The French Communist Party protests with indignation against the government's decision to prohibit the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth from operating within France.

　　This unprecedented decision, based on the decree issued by the gravedigger of France, Daladier, in 1939 and Pétain's laws, is one of a series of fascist measures taken by the French government on the orders of Eisenhower after his arrival in France. This decision proves the complete dependence of the French puppet government on the American imperialists. This decision is a new and serious step towards war. The bloody executioners who are ravaging brave Korea are afraid of the indomitable movement to defend peace that is unfolding throughout the world. They want to frantically continue the remilitarization of militaristic and revanchist West Germany in order to establish a base for anti-Soviet war in Europe and provoke a third world war.

　　The French Communist Party calls on all workers, all republicans, all participants in the resistance movement, and all French people who long for peace to rise up and protest these fascist bans, and demands that they work together to abolish these decrees. The French Communist Party is convinced that the French people will launch a great struggle for freedom and peace in all provinces, and will greatly strengthen the major French democratic organizations belonging to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth to answer these decrees.

　　法国共产党发表声明  抗议法政府无理禁令
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：人道报二十七日刊载法国共产党抗议法国政府禁止三大国际民主团体在法国活动的声明称：法国共产党以愤慨的心情抗议政府关于禁止世界工联、国际民主妇联、世界民主青联在法国境内活动的决定。
    这一根据一九三九年法国掘墓人达拉第所颁布的法令及贝当的法律而作的空前未有的决定，是艾森豪威尔抵达法国以后，法国政府奉他的命令所采取的一连串的法西斯措施之一。这一决定证明了法国仆从政府对美帝国主义者的完全依赖性。这一决定乃是走向战争的新的严重的步骤。对勇敢的朝鲜进行肆虐的血腥刽子手们，害怕在全世界展开的保卫和平的不屈不挠的运动。他们要疯狂地继续使军国主义的和复仇主义的西德重新军事化，以便在欧洲建立反苏战争的基地并挑起第三次世界大战。
    法国共产党号召全体劳动者、一切共和分子、一切抵抗运动的参加者、一切渴望和平的法国人民起来抗议这些法西斯禁令，并要求他们同心协力，以期达到废止这些法令。法国共产党深信，法国人民将在各省展开争取自由和平的伟大斗争，并大大加强属于世界工联、国际民主妇联和世界民主青联的法国各大民主组织，来回答这些法令。
