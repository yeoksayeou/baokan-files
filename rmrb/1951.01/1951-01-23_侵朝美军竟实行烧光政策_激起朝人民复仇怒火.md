Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: The retreating American aggressor troops are continuing to carry out an unprecedented and brutal scorched-earth policy in the peaceful cities and villages of Korea, creating "no-man's lands." According to United Press reporter Chapman, American soldiers in Korea "have been ordered to destroy every possible shelter that appears to be capable of being used by infiltrating troops as cover." The American military's "high command" has not only ordered troops to "burn" villages but has also instructed the air force to bomb "villages in remote rear areas" with napalm bombs (i.e., jellied gasoline bombs). Under their direction, the aggressor troops' artillery is even using the villages of peaceful Korean residents as "target practice." Chapman admitted that as a result of the American aggressor troops carrying out this order, they have "destroyed the fruits of generations of labor by the people of South Korea," causing the Korean people's "life's work to vanish in a puff of black smoke," "burning them out of their homes and families." Even some American soldiers "feel uneasy" about "this ruthless destruction." The "American generals" who command these atrocities shamelessly believe that "their scorched-earth policy is justified."

While implementing this scorched-earth policy, the American aggressor troops are also creating "no-man's lands." The "old men and women, the disabled, and the children whose faces hide despair, helplessness, and bewilderment" created by the scorched-earth policy are forbidden to stay in the American military's "defense zone" and are "forever forced to move south," wandering and suffering.

These murderous and arsonous atrocities of the American aggressors are arousing the fury of revenge of an even broader section of the Korean people. Chapman revealed that "the American military's burning of farms and villages in the Korean mountains has aroused a tide of protest and anger from the people." There is no doubt that they will demand repayment of this blood debt from the enemy.

### 侵朝美军竟实行烧光政策  激起朝人民复仇怒火

　　侵朝美军竟实行烧光政策
    激起朝人民复仇怒火
    【新华社二十二日讯】节节败退的美国侵略军，继续兽性地对朝鲜和平城乡实行史无前例的残暴的烧光政策，制造“无人区”。据合众社记者查普曼透露，侵朝美军的士兵“已奉令破坏看来可以被渗入的军队用作隐蔽的每一个可能的掩护物”。美军“高级指挥部”不但已下令军队把村庄“烧光”，并训令空军用纳巴姆弹（即凝固汽油弹）轰炸“偏僻后方地区中的村庄”。在他们的指使下，侵略军的炮兵竟以朝鲜和平居民的村庄作为“打靶目标”。查普曼承认，由于美国侵略军执行这个命令的结果，他们已“摧毁南朝鲜人数代劳动的成果”，使朝鲜人民“一生的劳动消失在一阵黑烟里”，“把他们烧得没有住屋和家庭”。对于“这种无情的毁灭”，甚至若干美国兵也“感到内心不安”。而这些暴行的指挥者“美军将领们”，却无耻地认为“他们采取焦土政策是合理的”。
    在实行这种烧光政策的同时，美国侵略军并在制造“无人区”。由烧光政策制造出来的“脸上隐藏着绝望无援和茫然不知所措的老年男女，残废者和儿童们”，被禁止在美军的“防区”停留，“永远被迫着向南走去”，颠沛流离，备受磨难。
    美国侵略者这种杀人放火的暴行，正激起更广大朝鲜人民的复仇怒火。查普曼透露，“美军焚烧朝鲜山地上的农场和村庄，激起了老百姓的抗议怒潮”。毫无疑问的，他们将向敌人索还这笔血债。
