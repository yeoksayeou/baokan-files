    Chongqing Workers in Production Emulation
    Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation movement in November of last year, workers in Chongqing's factories, still in the stage of production recovery, immediately plunged into a patriotic production emulation upsurge. They initiated challenges between factories and between workshops, improved production systems and operational techniques, and increased product output and quality. At the same time, the competition also raised the workers' class consciousness and established ideas of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism. The slogan of the workers in the Jiangjin Clothing Factory was "Our volunteers have won victories in Korea, and we must also win victories on the production front." Their factory completed 100,000 sets of military cotton-padded coats in half a month. After boiler room workers raised the ventilation flue by more than four feet, the temperature inside the boiler increased, saving five to six thousand catties of coal per day. Workers at the state-owned 503 Automobile Repair Factory would start the furnace fire a quarter of an hour before work, and as soon as they heard the work bell, the hammers would clang. As a result, the output of steel plate perforation increased from 58 pieces to 105 pieces per day, breaking the factory's highest record in the past decade. At the state-owned 50th Ordnance Factory, due to the establishment of a new inspection system with inspectors going deep into the workshops, the scrap rate was reduced from 30 percent to 3 percent. Workers at the 406 Automobile Repair Factory created a model of the second and third gear movable lock for automobile gearboxes, increasing output from 56 pieces per person per day to 2,500 pieces, a fifty-fold increase. When repairing cars, no matter how heavy the rain or how deep the mud, the workers continued to work as usual. The state-owned steel plant, the jointly-owned state-private Minsheng Machinery Factory, and the privately-owned Yuxin Iron Factory challenged and responded to each other while rushing to manufacture iron bridge materials for the liberation of Tibet, and as a result, all three factories completed their tasks ahead of schedule. The work originally scheduled for seventy days by Minsheng Machinery Factory was actually completed in twenty-eight days. The 29th Steel Plant also completed its original plan thirty-one days ahead of schedule. Initially, the drilling team could only drill 15,610 holes per week, but in the second week, efficiency increased by 57 percent. The number of sheets cut by shearing workers increased from 50 to more than 100 per day. The Yuxin Iron Factory had poor equipment and no cold shearing machine or punching machine, and the material preparation work required manual labor, but it still completed the task thirty-one days ahead of schedule.

    生产竞赛中的重庆工人
    自去年十一月抗美援朝保家卫国运动展开后，还处在恢复生产阶段的重庆市各工厂职工，也立刻卷入了爱国生产竞赛热潮中。他们发动了厂与厂、车间与车间间的挑战，通过改进生产制度和操作技术，提高了产品的产量和质量。同时，通过竞赛也提高了职工们的阶级觉悟，树立了仇视、鄙视和蔑视美帝国主义的思想。江津被服厂工人的口号是“我们的志愿军在朝鲜打了胜仗，我们也要在生产战线上打胜仗”。他们厂在半个月间完成了十万套军用棉大衣。锅炉房工人把通风烟道加高了四尺多后，锅炉内热度增加，每天可省煤五、六千斤。国营五○三汽车修配厂的工人们在上班前一刻钟就把炉火烧好，只要一听上班的钟声，榔头便叮叮当当地响起来。这样，钢板卷孔的产量，由每天五十八片增加到一百零五片。打破该厂十年来的最高纪录。国营五十兵工厂由于建立新的检验制度，检验人员深入车间，废品率由百分之三十降低到百分之三。四○六汽车修配厂的工人，创造出汽车牙齿箱二、三挡活动锁子模型，使产量从每天每人五十六只增加到二千五百只，提高了五十倍。在修理汽车时，不管下多大的雨，泥浆有多深，工人还是照样地干着。国营某钢铁厂、公私合营的民生机器厂和私营的渝鑫铁工厂，在赶造为解放西藏用的铁桥材料时，互相挑战、应战，结果三厂均提前完成了任务。民生机器厂原定七十天的工作，实际上二十八天便完成了。二十九钢铁厂也提前三十一天完成了原订计划。开始时钻眼组每星期只能钻一五六一○个眼，第二个星期效率竟提高了百分之五十七。剪板工人由每天剪五十块提高到一百多块。渝鑫钢铁厂设备较差，没有冷剪机和冲眼机，下料工作都需要人力，但还是提前三十一天完成了任务。
