　　Many Bourgeois Newspapers in Western Europe
    Oppose the U.S.'s Adventurous Policies
    Express Dissatisfaction with the U.S.'s Rejection of Our Peaceful Proposals
    [This News Report] (Xinhua News Agency): The U.S. government's brazen rejection of our government's just proposals for a peaceful resolution to the Korean War, and its attempt to expand its aggressive actions, has aroused strong dissatisfaction among the ruling groups in Western European countries. The commentaries in many Western European newspapers clearly reflect this sentiment.
    The British *Daily Mail* said: "Acheson did not wait for the official transmission of China's reply," "before declaring that China's counter-proposals were 'unacceptable' to the U.S. government and the United Nations." The paper stated: "To make hasty judgments on such extremely important matters, and to speak for other countries without apparently prior consultation, is, to say the least, unusual." The *Spectator* also complained: "It is unfortunate that Acheson so rashly condemned China's counter-proposals as unacceptable." Regarding the U.S.'s attempt to coerce the U.S.-British group of nations to immediately accuse our country of being an "aggressor," the journal frankly asserted that "the British government should not endorse this action." The *Times* worriedly said: "The Political Committee of the UN General Assembly would do well not to take any hasty decisions regarding China's recent note." *The Manchester Guardian* believes that "the UN should not adopt any resolution that it is unable to implement." The paper also complained about the U.S., saying: "The current shortcoming of the U.S. is that it is too eager to support justice (which should be aggression) with force that it does not actually possess, and too little inclined to support it with diplomacy." The *New Statesman* wrote on the 26th: "The statements made by Gross and Austin, the U.S. representative to Lake Success, that the U.S. is unwilling to even negotiate on the Taiwan issue, are most shocking to the world." The Liberal Party's *News Chronicle* criticized MacArthur's recent remarks on the 26th. The paper stated: "Just when half the world is hoping to find some way to negotiate with China, MacArthur seized the opportunity to shout that he wants to beat the Chinese until their heads are broken and bleeding." The *Tribune* advocated that Britain should not maintain "false" solidarity with the U.S., saying: "It is unfortunate to sacrifice wisdom for the sake of false unity with the U.S."
    In France, *Franc-Tireur* fearfully requested that "Truman should not sacrifice peace in the Far East and the much-needed period of recuperation for Europe in order to seek long-term strategic control over Taiwan and to establish an unreliable and unprofitable 'friendship' with Chiang Kai-shek." *Le Figaro* further stated that the U.S. should "act prudently" because "taking threatening and coercive measures against China is a very serious matter."
    In Italy, according to a report from the Telepress Agency, "the semi-official newspapers, in commenting on China's proposals to the UN, have shown extraordinary caution." Even the Christian Democratic Party's *Il Popolo* had to admit on the 24th that China's recent proposals were "a step forward" in opening up prospects for peace.
    These opinions, reflecting the views of the ruling groups in Western European countries, greatly troubled the U.S. imperialists, who were eager to manipulate the UN to slander China as an "aggressor." After conducting an "investigation," a United Press reporter sadly admitted in a dispatch from London: "Europe is most afraid of war in the Far East, believing that such a war is a 'bottomless pit' that absorbs Western manpower." "All Western European countries advocate 'proceeding slowly' and say that the UN must act cautiously in making decisions."

### 西欧许多资产阶级报刊  反对美帝冒险政策  不满美帝拒绝我国和平建议

　　西欧许多资产阶级报刊
    反对美帝冒险政策
    不满美帝拒绝我国和平建议
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：美国政府悍然拒绝我国政府关于和平解决朝鲜战争的公正建议，而企图扩大侵略的冒险行为，已在西欧各国统治集团中引起了强烈的不满。西欧许多报纸的评论，明显地反映了这种情绪。
    英国《每日邮报》说：“艾奇逊没有等到中国的复文正式转来”，“就声明中国的反建议是美国政府和联合国所‘不能接受的’”。该报表示：“对这种极为重大的事情发表仓促的判断，并显然没有经过事先的商量便替别的国家说话，这至少是不平常的。”《旁观者》周刊也抱怨说：“艾奇逊竟如此卤莽地谴责中国的反建议为不能接受，这真是不幸的事。”而对于美国想胁迫美英集团国家立即诬指我国为“侵略者”的企图，该刊直率地主张“英国政府不要赞成这个行动”。泰晤士报忧虑地说：“联合国大会政治委员会对中国最近的照会，最好是不要急于采取任何轻率的决定。”曼彻斯特卫报认为“联合国决不要采取任何它的能力所不能实现的决定”。该报并埋怨美国说：“美国当前的缺点是，它太过分想用它实际上并未拥有的武力来支持正义（应该为侵略），而太少想到用外交来支持它。”《新政治家》周刊二十六日说：“葛罗斯及美国驻成功湖代表奥斯汀所发表的关于美国甚至不愿就台湾问题举行谈判的声明，是再令世人惊愕不过的了。”自由党的《新闻纪事报》二十六日抨击麦克阿瑟最近的发言。该报称：“正当半个世界希望找到与中国进行谈判的某种方法时，而麦克阿瑟却趁机大喊他要打得中国人头破血流。”《论坛》周刊主张英国不要与美国保持“虚伪”的团结，该刊说：“为着与美国的虚伪团结而牺牲智慧，乃是不幸的事。”
    在法国，《自由射手》报惶恐地要求“杜鲁门不要牺牲远东的和平与欧洲甚为需要的休养时间，而谋取对台湾的长期战略上的控制，以及与蒋介石建立不可靠而且得不偿失的‘友谊’。”《费加罗报》更表示：美国应“慎重将事”，因为“对中国采取威胁强迫的措施，乃是一件甚为严重的事情。”
    在意大利，据电通社报道，“各半官方报纸在评论中国致联合国的建议时，都表现了异乎寻常的谨慎。”连基督教民主党的《人民报》二十四日也不得不承认：中国最近的建议是为开辟和平前途“向前走了一步”。
    反映着西欧各国统治集团意见的这些舆论，使得急于企图操纵联合国诬蔑中国为“侵略者”的美帝国主义大为困恼。合众社记者在作过“调查”以后自伦敦发出的电讯悲哀地承认：“欧洲最怕远东的战争，认为这种战争是吸收西方人力的‘无底洞’。”“西欧一切国家都力主‘慢慢来’，并说联合国采取决定必须谨慎。”
