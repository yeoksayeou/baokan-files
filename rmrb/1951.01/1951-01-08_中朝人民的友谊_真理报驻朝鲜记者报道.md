Xinhua News Agency, January 6th. TASS, Moscow: The Pravda newspaper published on the 5th a dispatch from its correspondents in Korea, Kornilov and Qiulinov, reporting on the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. The dispatch wrote: The friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples is deeply rooted. As early as the end of the 16th century, when Japanese samurai invaded and ravaged Korea, the Chinese people stepped forward to help their Korean brothers. Through joint efforts, the enemy was driven out of Korean territory. The Chinese people also remember the days when Korean guerrillas fought alongside Chinese patriots against the Japanese occupiers in Northeast China, a situation that continued until the Japanese were driven out by the Soviet army.

Now, the American aggressors have replaced the Japanese bandits. The American aggressors have plunged Korean territory into a bloodbath, trying to turn Korea into a bridgehead for attacking China. Therefore, the Chinese people have once again extended a helping hand to their Korean brothers. Today, no city or village in China does not express sympathy for the Korean people's struggle to defend their freedom and independence. The Chinese people have organized volunteer forces to fight alongside the Korean People's Army, defeating the American intervention army.

The dispatch wrote: Residents of Korean cities and towns liberated from the occupation of the American aggressors warmly welcome the Chinese People's Volunteers. When the Chinese People's Volunteers passed through a county in North Pyongan Province, residents set up tables along the roadside, laden with hot food. Farmers also prepared many gifts for the Chinese People's Volunteers, packages of food and medicine. A city liberated from the occupation of the American aggressors recently held a conference, at which a telegram was passed to the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea. The telegram said: "Dear friends! The Korean people will never forget the blood you shed on our land ravaged by American interventionists. Your heroic deeds will be recorded in the history of the Korean people's liberation struggle and will be immortal. Your assistance to our country has safeguarded the security of your own country's borders and consolidated the cause of peace throughout the world. Glory to you - representatives of the great Chinese people! Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!"

Pyongyang is now far from the front lines. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have advanced to the south. The American and British intervention troops and the Syngman Rhee bandits are being exhausted day by day. The day of the complete defeat and annihilation of the American aggressors is approaching.

The reporters emphasized: The fraternal and consolidated friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, who are fighting for their freedom and independence and for the defense of peace and freedom, is a guarantee of the complete defeat and annihilation of the American aggressors.

　　中朝人民的友谊
    真理报驻朝鲜记者报道
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报五日刊载该报记者科尔尼洛夫和邱里诺夫的朝鲜通讯，报道中朝人民的友谊。通讯写道：中朝人民的友谊是根深蒂固的。早在十六世纪末叶，当日本武士道者侵略和蹂躏朝鲜的时候，中国人民就曾挺身而出，援助朝鲜兄弟人民。在共同努力之下，把敌人赶出了朝鲜的土地。中国人民也记得朝鲜游击队与中国爱国者并肩在中国东北对日本占领者战斗的日子，这种情形一直继续到日本人被苏军赶出的时候为止。
    现在，美国侵略者代替了日本强盗。美国侵略者把朝鲜领土浸在血泊里，想把朝鲜变成进攻中国的桥头堡。于是，中国人民又向朝鲜兄弟人民伸出了援助之手。今天，中国没有一个城市和乡村的人民不对朝鲜人民保卫他们的自由和独立的斗争表示同情。中国人民组织了志愿部队，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，击溃美国干涉军。
    通讯写道：从美国侵略者的占领下得到解放的朝鲜城市与村镇的居民，热烈欢迎中国人民志愿军。中国人民志愿军经过平安北道的某县时，居民在道旁摆好桌子，桌上放着热腾腾的食品。农民们也为中国人民志愿军准备了许多礼物，一包包的食物和药品。从美国侵略者占领下解放的某城，不久前举行大会，会上通过致电在朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军。电文说：“亲爱的朋友们！朝鲜人民永远忘不了你们在我们这受到美国干涉者蹂躏的国土上洒下的鲜血。你们英雄的事迹将载在朝鲜人民解放斗争的历史上而永垂不朽。你们给我国的援助，保卫了你们自己祖国边疆的安全，并巩固了全世界的和平事业。光荣归于你们——伟大中国人民的代表，中朝人民永恒的友谊万岁！”
    平壤现在已远离前线。朝鲜人民军部队与中国人民志愿军已推进到南面去了。美、英干涉军和李承晚匪军正一天天在耗竭。美国侵略者的彻底失败和被歼的日子快要到了。
    记者强调指出：正在为他们的自由与独立，为保卫和平与自由而战斗的中朝人民的兄弟般的巩固友谊，就是彻底击败和歼灭美国侵略者的保证。
