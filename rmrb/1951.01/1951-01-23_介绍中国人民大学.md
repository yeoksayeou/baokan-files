　　Introducing Renmin University of China
　　Hu Xikui, Vice President of Renmin University

　　Renmin University of China is a new type of university in the People's Republic of China. It was founded according to the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. It adopts the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and employs Soviet professors to cultivate various construction cadres in a planned and step-by-step manner to meet the needs of China's various construction projects.

　　After a long period of preparation, Renmin University of China officially started classes on September 1st last year. The university is divided into:

　　(1) Undergraduate programs, divided into eight departments: (1) Department of Economic Planning; (2) Department of Finance and Credit; (3) Department of Trade; (4) Department of Cooperative Societies; (5) Department of Factory Management; (6) Department of Law; (7) Department of Diplomacy; (8) Department of Russian Language. The Department of Law and the Department of Diplomacy are four-year programs, the Department of Russian Language is a two-year program, and the others are three-year programs.

　　(2) Specialized courses (mainly short-term training courses for rotating cadres from various enterprises and government agencies) are divided into eleven classes: (1) Economic Planning Class; (2) Finance and Credit Class; (3) Domestic Trade Class; (4) Foreign Trade Class; (5) Cooperative Society Class; (6) Factory Management Class; (7) Statistics Class; (8) Law Class; (9) Diplomacy Class; (10) Education Class; (11) History and Geography Class. All are eight-month programs.

　　(3) Workers' and Peasants' Cultural Supplementary Classes: Specially designed for supplementing cultural and scientific knowledge, divided into one-year and two-year programs. Graduates can directly enter undergraduate programs.

　　The curriculum for undergraduate and specialized courses is fully adapted to the needs of national construction and the purpose of serving the people. This is the main difference from old-style universities.

　　Renmin University of China currently has 1,519 undergraduate students, 1,138 specialized course students, and 273 cultural supplementary class students, totaling 2,930 students; among them, cadres and workers account for about 72%, with good political quality but lower cultural level. They encountered difficulties in learning at the beginning, but due to their efforts, most of their usual grades are good. Young intellectuals account for about 28%, with better cultural conditions. Generally, they have undergone ideological remolding and are progressing quickly. In short, the students are revolutionary cadres, workers, and young intellectuals, with high political awareness, and are easy to accept scientific truths and revolutionary construction experiences. According to the results of the usual grade check in November, it proves that after three months of intensive and arduous efforts, they have basically been able to complete the plan according to the teaching progress. The passing rate of undergraduate students in each course is 92.73%, and the failure rate is 7.27%. Among the eleven specialized courses, the number of students passing in five classes accounts for more than 80%, and the number of students passing in six classes accounts for more than 90%. It can be seen that the vast majority of students, whether they are worker-peasant cadres, industrial workers, or young intellectuals, can keep up with the teaching progress. For a small number of students who fail and have difficulties in learning, they are remedied by strengthening tutoring and improving learning methods. The education plan for undergraduate and specialized courses is formulated based on the needs of China's current construction and with reference to the advanced experience of Soviet higher education (in addition, a separate education plan for graduate students has also been formulated). Undergraduate students in each department, except for the Department of Russian Language, must study 20 to 30 courses, of which political theory courses account for 20% to 25%, professional courses account for 50% to 55%, and cultural courses account for 20%. Students in each specialized course must study 12 to 15 courses, with 7 to 9 courses per semester. Among them, political theory courses account for 26% and professional courses account for 74% for the History and Geography and Education classes, and political courses account for 37% and professional courses account for 63% for the remaining classes. This is the general provision of the education plan. Its basic spirit is the close combination of the basis of Marxism-Leninism and various specialized sciences. The implementation steps are: at the beginning, emphasis is placed on political theory courses, mainly to lay the foundation of Marxism-Leninism first, and then gradually increase professional courses. The further we go, the greater the proportion of professional courses. The goal is to cultivate experts who are proficient in Marxism-Leninism and specialized business.

　　The basic spirit of the teaching method is the combination of theory and practice. On the one hand, emphasis is placed on systematic and scientific theoretical lectures, guiding students to study original works of Marxism-Leninism and various scientific theoretical works, and promoting the spirit of students' hard self-study and in-depth research. On the other hand, through "seminars" (СеминаР) (Note: "Seminar" is a teaching system adopted by Soviet schools, that is, planned and focused discussions under the direct guidance of teachers and making conclusions.), tutoring, various assignments and experiments, visits and production internships, etc., the learned theories can be thoroughly understood and practically applied. This can not only overcome the empirical tendency of neglecting theory, but also prevent the danger of dogmatism detached from reality. In order to ensure the combination of theory and practice, we have established business contacts with the relevant departments of the Central People's Government, especially with the financial and economic departments.

　　This planned, guided, and organized teaching system and method must also rely on strict inspection and examination systems to supervise implementation. There are basically three types of inspection systems: (1) inspections by inspectors and stenographers set up by the Academic Affairs Department; (2) inspections by each department of teachers and students filling out forms; (3) inspections by the teaching and research office of teachers' lectures and students' usual grades and examinations. There are two types of examinations: (1) Cultural courses, using both written and oral examinations; (2) General courses, using oral examinations. The advantages of oral examinations are: first, accuracy; second, easy to understand the real situation of learning. However, examinations should focus on major courses, generally not exceeding five per semester, so as to avoid overburdening students and causing formalistic tendencies. Through these methods, our teachers not only give lectures, but also are responsible for the entire teaching process.

　　In order to train teaching cadres and improve their scientific level, as well as to cultivate experts with modern scientific levels, therefore, establishing scientific research work in the university is of paramount importance. We paid attention to this work from the beginning. In order to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and to review the achievements of our scientific research work, each teaching and research office held the first scientific discussion meeting from October 18th to 20th. A total of 824 people participated, including 168 representatives from the capital's scientific community, professors from various universities, and representatives from relevant agencies of the Central People's Government. Thirty-one reports and discussions were conducted, involving the basic theoretical issues, policy issues, and linguistics issues of the construction of New China. This scientific discussion meeting profoundly educated our teachers, graduate students, and teaching administrative staff, further improved their correct understanding of scientific research work, and became a good start for future scientific research work. The school-wide scientific research work plan for this year is currently being drafted, and graduate students and students are also being prepared to participate, so that it can become a regular, systematic, and mass scientific research work. When scientific research work is raised to a certain level in the future, it can also accept the entrustment of relevant government departments to carry out scientific research on specialized business, directly helping the country's construction work.

　　In order to effectively carry out teaching and scientific research work, we have now established 41 teaching and research offices. Their basic tasks are: 1. Directly responsible for organizing teaching. 2. Carry out scientific research work. 3. Improve teachers' level of Marxism-Leninism. 4. Train graduate students. After several months of work, thanks to the patient help of Soviet professors and the active work of Chinese teachers, a large number of new teachers have been trained, which is a great gain.

　　In order to cultivate a large number of teachers in a more planned and step-by-step manner in the future, we have transferred 220 graduate students with higher political quality and cultural level from cadres and students to each teaching and research office. Under the leadership of the teaching and research office, they carry out independent research work according to the plan. The specific methods are lecturing, self-study, seminars (СеминаР), writing papers, reports, teaching internships, etc. After more than three months of study, they have made great progress, especially improving their ability and confidence in reading original works of Marxism-Leninism. For example, when reading Capital, they have overcome basic difficulties and become interested. We also plan to train a part of graduate students from outstanding students every year to solve the problem of teachers. After the start of the first semester, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government transferred more than 100 professors and lecturers from Beijing, Northeast, Central South, Southwest, and East China to participate in the study of graduate students. Except for individual cases, they have generally gradually developed learning habits and made great progress.

　　In order to implement the new education plan and education system, a single responsibility system at all levels is adopted in organizational leadership. Both administrative and teaching organizations have a certain number of staff and work quotas. The organization is simple, the division of labor is clear, and the responsibility is specialized. Work regulations for each department are also stipulated to implement unified and centralized leadership.

　　In addition to adopting a single responsibility system at all levels, the school also establishes democratic consultation institutions—the school committee and the department committee—in the school headquarters and each department. The organizational structure is: the school committee is chaired by the president, and the department committee is chaired by the department director. The heads of teaching and administrative units, Soviet experts, the university party committee of the Communist Party of China, representatives of the branch and mass organizations, and representatives of relevant government enterprises or agencies are absorbed to participate. Their task is to review important reports and experience summaries related to teaching and research work. The school committee and the department committee are scheduled to meet once a month to make suggestive resolutions, which are implemented after being approved by the president. Since the beginning of the school year, due to the implementation of this guided democratic consultation, the enthusiasm and creativity of teaching and scientific research workers have been greatly brought into play, which is convenient for concentrating leadership and persisting in it.

　　In terms of leadership methods, all departments of undergraduate programs, all classes of specialized courses, and all teaching and research offices are implementing the spirit of combining leadership with the broad masses, creating many teaching methods that go deep into the masses. The main thing is to be good at absorbing the correct opinions of the masses and improving leadership. At the same time, the organizations of the Party, trade union, Communist Youth League, and student union in the university are closely combined with teaching and administrative work to ensure the completion of teaching plans and tasks. This is also one of the basic characteristics of the new formal university, and it has achieved great results. The party organizations at all levels focus on ensuring the improvement of teaching in party life and various activities, emphasizing the political ideology and theoretical scientificity of teaching. In order to improve the political and theoretical level of party and non-party cadres, under the leadership of the party committee, a formal Marxism-Leninism night university and night school were established. Except for cadres and personnel from the Marxism-Leninism and political economy teaching and research office, all other teaching and administrative cadres and personnel participated; the academic system was stipulated to be two years and one year respectively. The main courses are the basics of Marxism-Leninism, political economy, the history of the Chinese revolution, philosophy, and Chinese economic policies. Generally, cadres reflect that they have initially obtained a systematic understanding of several basic theories in learning, so they have a high degree of confidence in learning, especially for the training and improvement of teachers. The main work of the trade union is also centered on combining teaching, carrying out current affairs and policy education, organizing revolutionary competitions, and establishing labor discipline and reward systems. The Communist Youth League and the student union guarantee regular course learning and strengthen extracurricular cultural, sports, and various social activities. All of this is closely combined with teaching, which not only guarantees teaching, but also becomes one of the positive factors in improving teaching.

　　Due to the excellent composition of students, they often maintain full learning enthusiasm. The order and discipline of learning mainly rely on students' self-consciousness to maintain. Individual students who do not abide by the discipline can also be corrected in time under the supervision of classmates and the help of leadership. From the perspective of the leading backbone of faculty and staff, most of them are cadres who have undergone long-term tests of the revolution. Although they lack systematicness and higher guiding ability in theory, because these cadres generally possess excellent qualities and determination to learn, and receive scientific guidance from Soviet professors and active and enthusiastic help in all aspects, they can quickly improve themselves and lead a group of young teachers to move forward together. Due to the active efforts of faculty and staff in work and study, setting an example, and tirelessly launching revolutionary competitions; especially those engaged in teaching work, generally exceeding the work quota and time, a regular and intense atmosphere of learning has formed throughout the school. All students and staff have a high degree of confidence and determination in completing the plan according to the teaching progress.

　　At present, the construction work of Renmin University of China has just begun, and there are still many shortcomings and difficulties in the work: the main thing is that we lack experience in leadership, and many tasks remain to be established and improved. We also have more young teachers, and there is still a considerable distance in understanding and mastering the systematicness, scientificity of theory, and its connection with practical aspects. The cultural, political, and ideological levels of students are also inconsistent, and the translation work cannot keep up with the needs of teaching work. These are the biggest difficulties we currently face, and we hope that all parties will give instructions and help.

　　介绍中国人民大学
    人民大学副校长  胡锡奎
    中国人民大学是中华人民共和国的一个新型的大学。它是根据中央人民政府政务院的决定而创办的。它采用苏联先进的经验，并聘请苏联教授，有计划有步骤地培养各种建设干部，以适应我国各项建设的需要。
    经过长时间的筹备后，中国人民大学，已于去年九月一日正式开课，大学内分设：
    （一）本科，共分八系：（１）经济计划系；（２）财政信用系；（３）贸易系；（４）合作社系；（５）工厂管理系；（６）法律系；（７）外交系；（８）俄文系。法律系、外交系四年毕业，俄文系两年毕业，其他均为三年毕业。
    （二）专修科（这主要是轮训各企业机关干部的短期训练班）分十一个班：（１）经济计划班；（２）财政信用班；（３）国内贸易班；（４）对外贸易班；（５）合作社班；（６）工厂管理班；（７）统计班；（８）法律班；（９）外交班；（１０）教育班；（１１）史地班。均为八个月毕业。
    （三）工农文化补习班：专门进行文化科学知识的补习，分一年、两年毕业，毕业后直接升入本科。
    本科与专修科的课程，完全适合于国家建设需要与为人民服务的目的。这是与旧式大学的主要区别。
    中国人民大学现有本科学生一五一九人，专修科学生一一三八人，文化补习班二七三人，共计二九三○人；其中干部及工人约占百分之七十二，政治质量好，文化水平较低。在开始时学习感到困难，但由于他们的努力，故多数平时成绩尚好。青年知识分子约占百分之二十八，文化条件较好，政治上一般的都经过了思想改造，进步也是快的。总之，学生成份是革命的干部工人与青年知识分子，有较高的政治觉悟，容易接受科学的真理和革命的建设经验。根据十一月份平时成绩的检查结果，证明三个月来紧张的艰苦的努力，已基本上能按照教学的进度完成计划，本科学生各门课程及格者占百分之九十二点七三，不及格者占百分之七点二七，在专修科十一个班中，有五个班学生及格人数占百分之八十以上，有六个班学生及格人数占百分之九十以上，可见绝大多数学生无论工农干部、产业工人与青年知识分子，都是能跟上教学进度前进的。少数不及格而学习有困难者，则用加强辅导和改进学习的方法补救之。本科及专修科的教育计划，是根据我国目前建设的需要并参考苏联高等教育的先进经验来制订的（此外，还另订有研究生的教育计划），本科除俄文系外，各系学生均须学习二十门至三十门课程，其中政治理论课占百分之二十至二十五，业务课占百分之五十至五十五，文化课占百分之二十。专修科各班学生均须学习十二门至十五门课程，每学期课程七门至九门。其中史地、教育两班，政治理论课占百分之二十六，业务课占百分之七十四，其余各班政治课占百分之三十七，业务课占百分之六十三。这是教育计划总的规定。其基本精神是马列主义基础与各种专门科学密切结合。其实施步骤，在开始时，着重政治理论课程，主要是为了首先打下马列主义的基础，然后逐步增加业务课程，愈往前进，业务课程的比例愈大。目的是要达到培养通晓马列主义和专门业务的专家。
    教学方法的基本精神，是理论与实践相结合，一方面着重系统的科学的理论的讲授，引导学生攻读马列主义原著和各种科学理论著作，提倡学生刻苦自学深入钻研的精神，另一方面，经过“习明纳尔”（СеминаР	）（按：习明纳尔是苏联学校所采取的一种教学制度，即在教师直接指导下所进行的有计划有重点的讨论并作出结论。）辅导，各种作业实验，参观与生产实习等方法，使所学的理论，得到透彻的理解和实际运用。这样既可以克服轻视理论的经验主义的偏向，又可以防止脱离实际的教条主义的危险。为了保障理论与实际相结合，我们与中央人民政府各有关部门，建立起了业务上的联系，特别是与财经部门关系较为密切。
    这种有计划、有领导、有组织的教学制度和方法，还必须依靠严格的检查制度与考试制度监督执行。检查制度基本上有三种：（１）教务部设立的视导员速记员的检查；（２）各系对教员学生填写表格制度的检查；（３）教研室对教员讲课的检查与对学生平时成绩及考试的检查。考试有两种：（１）文化课，采取笔试、口试两种并用；（２）一般的课程均采用口试。口试的好处是：一、准确；二、容易了解学习的真实情况。但考试应集中精力于主要课程，每一学期一般不超过五门，以免学生负担过重及发生形式主义的偏向。经过这些办法，我们的教员不仅进行讲课，而且对全部教学过程要负责任。
    为了培养教学干部和提高其科学水平，以及培养出具有现代科学水平的专家，因此，在大学内建立科学研究工作，就具有头等重要意义。我们一开始就注意这一工作。各教研室为了庆祝中华人民共和国成立一周年，并检阅我们科学研究工作的成果，于十月十八日至二十日举行了第一次科学讨论会，参加者共有八百二十四人，其中有首都科学界代表、各大学教授、中央人民政府有关机关代表一百六十八人。进行了三十一个报告与讨论，涉及到新中国建设的基本理论问题，政策问题和语言学问题。这次科学讨论会深刻地教育了我们的教员、研究生及教学行政人员，进一步提高了他们对科学研究工作的正确认识，成为今后科学研究工作良好的开端。现正在拟订今年全校科学研究工作计划，并准备吸收研究生、学生参加，使之成为经常的系统的群众性的科学研究工作。在科学研究工作提高到将来一定水平的情况下，还可以接受政府有关部门的委托，进行专门业务的科学研究，直接帮助国家的建设工作。
    为了有效地进行教学及科学研究工作，我们现已成立了四十一个教研室，其基本任务是１、直接负责组织教学。２、进行科学研究工作。３、提高教员马列主义水平。４、培养研究生。经过几个月的工作以后，由于苏联教授耐心帮助与中国教员的积极工作，培养了大批新的教员，这是一个很大的收获。
    为了今后更有计划有步骤地培养大批教员，我们从干部及学生中，给各教研室调配了二百二十名政治质量文化水平较高的研究生，他们在教研室领导下按照计划进行独立研究工作，其具体方法是讲授、自修、习明纳尔（СеминаР）、写论文、报告、教学实习等等。经过三个多月的学习，他们都有了很大的进步，特别是提高了阅读马列主义原著的能力和信心，例如读资本论，已经克服了基本的困难而发生了兴趣。我们还计划每年从优秀的学生中，培养一部分研究生，解决师资问题。第一学期开始后，中央人民政府教育部从北京、东北、中南、西南、华东各地调来教授讲师一百余人参加研究生的学习，除个别情况外，现一般已逐渐养成学习习惯，有很大进步。
    为了贯彻执行新的教育计划与教育制度，在组织领导上采取了各级单一负责制，行政与教学组织，都有一定的工作人员和工作定额，机构简便，分工明确，责任专一，并规定了各部门的工作条例，实行统一集中的领导。
    本校除采取各级单一负责制外，并且在校部及各系设立民主协议性质的机构——校委会及系委会。其组织构成是：校委会以校长为主席，系委会以系主任为主席，分别吸收教学及行政各单位的负责人，苏联专家，中国共产党大学党委，支部与群众团体代表及政府各有关企业或机关的代表参加，其任务是审查有关教学研究工作的重要报告与经验总结。校委会系委会规定每月开会一次，作出建议性的决议，经校长批准后贯彻执行。开学以来，由于实行了这种有领导的民主协议，大大地发挥了教学及科学研究工作者的积极性与创造性，便于在领导上集中起来又坚持下去。
    在领导方法上，本科各系专修科各班各教研室，都是贯彻着领导与广大群众相结合的精神，创造了很多深入群众的教学方法，主要的是善于吸收群众的正确意见，改进领导。同时在大学内的党、工会、青年团、学生会的组织，都是密切的结合教学与行政工作，保证教学计划与任务的完成，这也是新型正规大学的基本特点之一，收效很大。党的各级组织，在党的生活与各种活动方面，均以保证提高教学为中心，强调教学的政治思想性与理论的科学性。为了提高党与非党干部的政治理论水平，在党委领导下，成立了正规的马列主义夜大学与夜校，除马列主义、政治经济学教研室干部人员外，其他教学与行政干部人员一律参加；学制分别规定为二年及一年毕业，主要是学习马列主义基础、政治经济学、中国革命史、哲学及中国经济政策等课程。一般干部反映，在学习中，已初步获得了对于若干基本理论系统的理解，因此，对学习抱有高度的信心，特别是对于培养与提高教员是有重大意义的。工会的主要工作也是以结合教学为中心，进行时事政策教育，组织革命竞赛与建立劳动纪律及奖励制度。青年团、学生会则保证正课学习与加强课外的文化体育及各种社会活动。所有这一切都是密切的结合教学，不但保证教学，而且成为提高教学的积极因素之一。
    由于学生成份的优良，经常保持着饱满的学习情绪，学习的秩序与纪律，主要是依靠学生的自觉性来维持的。个别的不遵守纪律的学生，在同学们的监督与领导上的帮助下，也能及时地得到纠正。从教职员的领导骨干来说，也多半是经过革命的长期考验的干部，虽然在理论上还缺乏系统性与较高的指导能力，但由于这些干部一般地都具备了优秀的品质与学习的决心，并得到苏联教授在科学上的指导与各方面积极热诚地帮助，因而能迅速地提高了自己，并带领一批年青的教员一同前进。由于教职员在工作上与学习上的积极努力，以身作则，不知疲劳地展开革命竞赛；特别是担任教学工作人员，一般的都超过了工作的定额和时间，因而形成了全校经常的紧张的学习的风气。对于按照教学进度完成计划，全体学生和工作人员，都具有高度的信心和决心。
    目前中国人民大学的建设工作还只是开始，工作上的缺点和困难还很多：主要的是我们领导上的经验不足，很多工作尚待建立和改进。我们年青的教员也较多，对于理论的系统性、科学性及其与实际方面的联系，在体会上和掌握上还有相当的距离。学生的文化政治思想水平也不一致，翻译工作还赶不上教学工作的需要，这都是我们目前存在着的最大的困难，希望各方面加以指示和帮助。
