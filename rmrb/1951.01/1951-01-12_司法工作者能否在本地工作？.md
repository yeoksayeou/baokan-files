Can Judicial Workers Work in Their Local Area?

    Question: If judicial workers work in their local area, they are very likely to have relatives among the parties involved in the cases they handle, or have certain vested interests in the cases they handle, and therefore are very likely to be biased. Does the current People's Government have regulations stipulating that judicial workers cannot work in their local areas? If there are no such regulations, how can this problem be prevented?

    Answer: The People's Government does not have restrictions preventing judicial workers from working in their local areas. The People's Court has methods for judges to recuse themselves automatically or passively from trying a specific case, depending on the circumstances. For example, if a judge has a spousal or other familial relationship with one of the parties, or has certain vested interests in the case, they should recuse themselves; otherwise, the other party may request their recusal. If the president of the court knows of the above circumstances, they should order the judge to recuse themselves. In addition, if specific circumstances are sufficient to believe that the judge has a biased tendency, even if the judge does not have the above-mentioned reasons for recusal, the party may state the reasons to the president of the court to which the judge belongs and request consideration of whether they should recuse themselves.

　　司法工作者能否在本地工作？
    问：司法工作者在本地工作，很可能与其所处理案件当事人之一方有亲属关系，或与其所处理的案件有某些利害关系，因而很可能发生偏颇倾向。现在人民政府是否有司法工作者不能在其本地工作的规定？如果没有规定的话，如何能防止这个弊端？
                                  一读者
    答：人民政府并没有司法工作者不能在其本地工作的限制。人民法院对审判员审判某一具体案件本有分别情形自动或被动回避的办法。如审判员与当事人之一方有配偶其他亲属等关系，或对该案有某些利害关系时，即应自行回避；否则，当事人之他方即可声请他回避。院长如知有上述情形时，应命该审判员回避。此外，如因具体情况足以认为审判员确有偏颇的倾向时，即使审判员并无上述应自回避之原因，当事人亦可举述原因向该员所属之院长要求考虑其应否回避。
