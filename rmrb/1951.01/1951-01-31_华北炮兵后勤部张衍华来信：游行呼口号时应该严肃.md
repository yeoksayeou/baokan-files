　　Letter from Zhang Yanhua of the Logistics Department of the North China Artillery:
    Seriousness is Needed When Shouting Slogans During Parades
    In the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend the Nation, people from all walks of life in the capital have held demonstrations. This patriotic action has deeply educated and encouraged me. However, some parade participants were casual and not serious enough when shouting slogans; some even made a lot of noise and laughed. I don't think this is right. American imperialism is our mortal enemy; we should hate it, despise it, and scorn it. Our demonstrations are an expression of our will. Therefore, when shouting slogans, we should be very serious, showing the powerful strength of the Chinese people in defending world peace, and making warmongers all over the world tremble before us.

### 华北炮兵后勤部张衍华来信：游行呼口号时应该严肃

　　华北炮兵后勤部张衍华来信：
    游行呼口号时应该严肃
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，首都各界人士都举行了游行示威。这种爱国行动，深深地教育和鼓励了我。但是个别游行队伍在喊口号时，有随随便便、不够严肃的情形；甚至有些人还哄闹嘻笑。我认为这是不对的。美帝国主义是我们的死敌，我们应该仇视它，鄙视它，蔑视它。我们的游行示威就是我们意志的表示。因此，在喊口号时，应该十分严肃，表示出中国人民保卫世界和平的强大力量，让全世界战争贩子们在我们面前发抖。
