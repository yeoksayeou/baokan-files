　　New Year's Day (1951)
　　Lao She
　　I have been back in Beijing for a full year. A year? No, no, no! For me, this is not a year, but a lifetime! Look, in my lifetime, in which year could I have learned so many new insights, new knowledge, new outlooks on life, and new worldviews? Look, what I have seen and learned this year is not only what I personally should see and learn, but also what all progressive people in the world should see and learn! Living this year, I have not lived this life in vain. Without this year, even if I lived another fifty or a hundred years, it would still be in vain!
　　Before this year, I was already called a literary and art worker. But, do I deserve that title? I dare not say. Today, after living in the new Beijing for a year, I truly understand: only if I serve the people can I be called a literary and art worker, and I have also begun to move in the direction of the people. This gives me a new life and a new mission; this moment of new life can see the eternal truth, because human happiness and the ultimate goal can only be achieved in accordance with what the People's Government has implemented this year: relying on the people for everything, and doing everything for the people. No matter how stupid I am, as long as I am willing to move in the direction of light, I will not have lived this life in vain; as long as I am willing to learn from the people and then write for the people, I can be worthy of myself, worthy of literature and art, and worthy of the title of literary and art worker. Ah, I was able to understand the above principles in just one year, isn't this year equal to fifty-three years? I have lived for fifty-three years, and this is the first time I have understood this principle! I am happy, excited. Can I not be happy and excited? As the saying goes: Lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the spot. I am now, putting down the burden and becoming an adult on the spot – a modern person, a person of the future, a person who serves the people! Well, 1950 has passed, I have put down the burden; 1951 has begun today, I want to shoulder new responsibilities, so that I can achieve self-renewal along with the renewal of all things on New Year's Day!
　　From now on, if anyone dares to despise or hate the Chinese people and the People's Government, I will use my pen, my thoughts, and even my teeth, to punish and bite them to death!

　　元旦（一九五一）
    老舍
    回到北京已整整一年。一年？不，不，不！对于我，这不是一年，而是一生！看吧，在我的一生里，我在哪一年能学到这么多的新见识、新学问、新人生观与新世界观呢？看吧，这一年所看到学到的，不但是我个人所应看应学的，而且是世界上所有的往前进的人们所应当看的学的呀！我活了这一年，就不白活了这一生。没有这一年，即使我再活五十年，一百年，也是白活！
    在这一年以前，我已被称为文艺工作者。可是，我对得起那个称呼吗？我不敢说。今天，在新北京住过了一年之后，我的确明白了：只要我给人民服务，我才能被称为文艺工作者，而且我也开始朝着人民的方向走去。这，教我有了新的生命，与新的使命；这新生命的一刻，就可以见到永恒的真理，因为人类的幸福与最终目的就是依照这一年里人民政府所设施的才能达到的：一切仰仗人民，一切为了人民。不管我怎么笨，只要我肯朝着光明的方向走，我就不虚此生；只要我肯向人民学习，而后为人民写作，我便可以对得起自己，对得起文艺，对得起文艺工作者这个称呼。啊，我能在短短的一年内，明白了上述的道理，这一年不是等于五十三年么？我活了五十三年，这还是头一回明白此理呀！我快乐，兴奋。我能不快乐，兴奋吗？常言说得好：放下屠刀，立地成佛。我现在是，放下包袱立地成人——现代的人，将来的人，为人民服务的人！好吧，一九五○年已成过去，我放下了包袱；一九五一年今天已开始，我要肩起新的责任，教我随着元旦的万象更新得到自我更新！
    从此，假若有人敢轻视或仇视中国人民和人民政府，我就会用我的笔，我的思想，甚至我的牙，去诛伐，去咬死它！
