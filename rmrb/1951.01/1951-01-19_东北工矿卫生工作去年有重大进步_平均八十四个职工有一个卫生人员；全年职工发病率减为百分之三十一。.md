Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 17th: Northeast China's industrial and mining hygiene work made significant progress in 1950, noticeably improving workers' health. Last year, the number of industrial and mining hygiene organizations in the region greatly increased. In 1949, there was one hygiene department, ten hospitals, one branch hospital, one hundred and thirty-four health clinics, one emergency clinic, and one hygiene technical school in the industrial and mining areas of Northeast China. By 1950, this had increased to four hygiene departments, sixteen hospitals, six branch hospitals, two hundred and sixty-five health clinics, forty-one emergency clinics, and seven hygiene technical schools (including training classes). In addition, twenty-four new amateur sanatoriums, one pharmaceutical factory, two outpatient clinics, one medical supply and sales department, and thirty-six maternal and child health stations were established. Medical equipment also roughly doubled compared to 1949. Due to the expansion of institutions and equipment, the ratio of all employees to hospital beds in 1950 improved from one hundred and eighty-one to one in 1949 to one hundred and fifteen to one. The number of medical personnel in Northeast China's industrial and mining areas also increased significantly in 1950, with doctors increasing by 80% compared to 1949. Thus, the average of one health worker per one hundred and twenty-two employees in 1949 improved to one health worker per eighty-four employees in 1950.

　　Over the past year, as a result of the industrial and mining hygiene departments implementing the principle of "prevention first, treatment as secondary," the working conditions and protective equipment in various factory and mine special operation sites have been greatly improved, and the incidence of worker poisoning and occupational diseases has been greatly reduced. According to statistics, the proportion of workers poisoned in special operations sites in the first quarter of 1950 was 18.7%, which dropped to 4.8% in the second quarter, and continued to fall to 4% in October. In order to reduce the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases, the Northeast People's Government Health Department allocated 600,000 doses of various vaccines to industrial and mining systems last year. Although there were severe outbreaks of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, relapsing fever, typhoid fever, dysentery, and other infectious diseases in Northeast China last year, very few workers were affected. According to statistics from several major factories and mines, 1,639 workers contracted infectious diseases in the first half of 1949, while only 509 workers contracted them throughout 1950. Timely and reasonable treatment of employee illnesses has also reduced the mortality rate from 3.8% in the first half of 1949 to 0.78% in 1950.

　　As a result of the above-mentioned series of health care efforts, the morbidity rate of employees in Northeast China's industrial and mining areas has gradually decreased over the past year. From September to December 1949, the morbidity rate of employees was 36.5%, which decreased to 31.3% in 1950. At the same time, due to improved medical equipment and continuous improvement of medical personnel's skills, the cure rate also increased from 68% to 90.23%. With the establishment of maternal and child health stations, the infant mortality rate of employees decreased from 26.3% to 4.7%.

　　The Northeast People's Government Industrial Department Hygiene Department held the Northeast Industrial and Mining Hygiene Administrative Work Conference at the end of last year, which conducted in-depth inspections of medical organization, systems, and other aspects, and made effective improvements. Various industrial and mining hygiene organizations are now actively carrying out disinfection, cleaning, epidemic prevention, vaccination, and other preparatory work; and are universally organizing occupational disease research committees to study the causes and prevention of diseases in order to protect the health of employees.

　　东北工矿卫生工作去年有重大进步
    平均八十四个职工有一个卫生人员；全年职工发病率减为百分之三十一。
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】一九五零年东北工矿卫生工作有重大进步，显著地改善了工人的健康状况。去年全区工矿卫生机构大大增多。一九四九年东北全区工矿中共有一个卫生处、十个医院、一个分院、一百三十四个卫生所、一个急救所和一个卫生技术学校，一九五零年已增加到四个卫生处、十六个医院、六个分院、二百六十五个卫生所、四十一个急救所和七个卫生技术学校（包括训练班）。此外还新设了二十四个业余疗养所、一个制药厂、两个门诊部、一个医药供销处和三十六个妇婴保健站。医疗设备也较一九四九年增加了一倍左右。由于机构与设备的扩充，一九五零年全体职工与病床的比例，即由一九四九年的一百八十一比一提高到一百一十五比一。一九五零年东北工矿中的医务人员也显著增加，其中医生较一九四九年增加了百分之八十。这样，一九四九年平均一百二十二个职工有一个卫生人员，到一九五零年已提高到八十四个职工有一个卫生人员。
    过去一年中，工矿卫生部门执行“预防为主，治疗为辅”方针的结果，各厂矿特殊作业场所的劳动条件与防护设备有了很多改进，职工中毒和职业病的发生已大为减少。据统计，特殊作业现场的职工在一九五零年第一季度中毒的比例为百分之十八点七，第二季降为百分之四点八，到十月份续降至百分之四。为了减少传染病的发生和发展，东北人民政府卫生部去年拨给各工矿系统各种疫苗达六十万份。去年东北各地虽然发生了剧烈的流行性脑脊髓膜炎、回归热、伤寒、赤痢等传染病，但工人患者极少。据几个主要厂矿统计，一九四九年上半年患传染病的工人有一千六百三十九名，一九五零年全年仅有五百零九人。对于职工疾病及时与合理的救治，使死亡率亦由一九四九年上半年的百分之三点八降至一九五零年的百分之零点七八。
    由于上述一系列的卫生保健工作，一年来东北工矿职工的发病率已逐渐减少。一九四九年九月到十二月职工的发病率为百分之三十六点五，一九五零年降低至百分之三十一点三。同时，由于医疗设备较前完善，医务人员的技术不断提高，使治愈率也由百分之六十八提高到百分之九十点二三。妇婴保健站的设立，职工婴儿的死亡率由百分之二十六点三降至百分之四点七。
    东北人民政府工业部卫生处于去年末曾召开了东北工矿卫生行政工作会议，对医疗组织、制度等方面都进行了深刻检查，并作了有效的改进。各工矿卫生机构现正积极进行消毒、清扫、防疫、种痘等准备工作；并普遍组织职业病研究委员会，研究疾病发生的原因和防治办法，以保障职工健康。
