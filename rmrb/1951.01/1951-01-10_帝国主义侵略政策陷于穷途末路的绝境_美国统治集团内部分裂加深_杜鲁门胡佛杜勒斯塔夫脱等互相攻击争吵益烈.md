Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: With the continued defeat of the American aggressor troops on the Korean battlefield, the debate within the US ruling clique over the aggression policy, which has rapidly intensified since Hoover's speech, fully demonstrates that the US imperialist aggression policy has fallen into a dead end. Neither those who agree with Hoover's proposition nor those who oppose it can find a viable path of aggression for US imperialism. Hoover's supporters describe the Truman administration's current aggression policy as "the most complete failure the United States has ever suffered," while Truman's supporters describe Hoover's line as "containing the seeds of collapse."

Supporters of Truman's current aggression policy are trying their best to defend their failures and vehemently attacking their opponents. Truman himself openly called Hoover's proposal "isolationism" at a press conference on December 28th of last year. Dulles, one of the Republican leaders supporting Truman, also refuted Hoover's aggression line as a plan that "contains the seeds of collapse." US Secretary of State Acheson, in his New Year's message, stated even more bluntly that implementing Hoover's proposition would be equivalent to "abandoning our (referring to the United States) allies" and "would be a large-scale appeasement." Acheson also indicated that he would "vigorously promote various plans and policies that have been proven effective by actual testing." Former US Secretary of the Army Patterson believes that Hoover's argument is "running away from Europe" and that "this argument advocates that the best place to fight, if we must fight, is on our own soil." He said that this is inviting others to "conquer our own country."

The above-mentioned ardent supporters of the Truman line anxiously expressed their fear that once the Hoover line is implemented, it will lead to devastating consequences for US imperialism. However, they cannot answer in the slightest what measures the US government can take to continue to implement the current aggression policy that has suffered a disastrous defeat without suffering even greater failures. And this is precisely the issue that the opponents of the Truman administration are focusing on attacking.

Senator Taft, one of the Republican leaders, is a prominent example in this regard. On December 29th of last year, he vehemently criticized the mood in Washington as "oscillating between panic and reassurance, and this mood extends all the way to the Pentagon (referring to the location of the US Department of Defense)." He called "the situation in Korea" "the most complete failure that the United States has ever suffered." He openly revealed that senators in secret meetings doubted whether the United States could hold Korea or whether it could protect Japan or the Philippines. Taft said, "I don't have much faith in the judgment of senior military officials." Republican Senator Watkins said, "I completely disagree with Truman." Senator Wiley, the Republican leader in the Senate, supported Hoover's speech and demanded the replacement of Acheson, saying that this was "for the benefit of national unity." Wiley said that Acheson's foreign policy had failed. The American people, like the people of various countries "friendly to the United States," do not trust Acheson.

Mutual attacks have now become commonplace among the aggressors. Martin, one of the Republican leaders, said, "Now is the time for us to thoroughly discuss and re-examine our plans and responsibilities." Even Russell, Director of the Public Affairs Office of the State Department, had to say, "We are in the midst of the most serious crisis" and that "we should examine whether our leadership and our policies are good and how they should be improved." However, how can US imperialism find a viable path of aggression?

### 帝国主义侵略政策陷于穷途末路的绝境  美国统治集团内部分裂加深  杜鲁门胡佛杜勒斯塔夫脱等互相攻击争吵益烈

　　帝国主义侵略政策陷于穷途末路的绝境
    美国统治集团内部分裂加深
    杜鲁门胡佛杜勒斯塔夫脱等互相攻击争吵益烈
    【新华社八日讯】随着美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上的继续溃败，美国统治集团内部自胡佛演说后即迅速激烈化的关于侵略政策的争论，充分地表明美帝国主义的侵略政策已陷于穷途末路的绝境。不论赞成胡佛主张或反对胡佛主张的人，都无法为美帝国主义找到一条行得通的侵略路线。胡佛的赞成者把杜鲁门政府的现行侵略政策说成是“美国从来未遭受到的最完全的失败”，而杜鲁门的拥护者则把胡佛路线说成“包含着崩溃的种子”。
    杜鲁门现行侵略政策的支持者，竭力为自己的失败辩护，并极力攻击自己的反对者。杜鲁门本人在去年十二月二十八日的记者招待会上公然把胡佛的建议称为“孤立主义”，支持杜鲁门的共和党头目之一杜勒斯也驳斥胡佛的侵略路线是“本身就包含着崩溃的种子”的计划，美国国务卿艾奇逊在其新年文告中更直率表示：实行胡佛的主张就等于“抛弃我们（指美国）的盟友”，“就等于大规模的姑息”。艾奇逊并表示“将大力推行实际考验业已证明其效力的各种计划与政策”。前美国陆军部长柏德逊认为，胡佛的论据就是“从欧洲逃跑”，“这种论据主张：作战的最好的地方，假使我们必须作战的话，就是在我们的国土上作战”。他说，这就是邀请别人“征服我们自己的国家”。
    上面这些杜鲁门路线的热心支持者忧心忡忡地表示害怕一旦实行胡佛路线，就会给美国帝国主义招致毁灭性的后果，但是他们却丝毫不能回答美国政府有什么办法可以继续实行现行的已经遭受惨败的侵略政策而不遭到更大的失败。而这却正是杜鲁门政府的反对者所集中攻击的问题。
    共和党首脑之一参议员塔夫脱在这方面是一个显著的事例。他在去年十二月二十九日猛烈指责华盛顿的情绪是“在狼狈周章和重新保证之间摇摆着，这种情绪一直通到五角大楼（按系美国国防部所在地）”。他把“朝鲜的局势”称做是“美国所从未遭受到的最完全的失败”。他公开透露：参议员们在秘密会议上怀疑美国能否守住朝鲜或者能否保住日本或菲律宾。塔夫脱说：“我对于高级军方的判断没有很大的信仰。”共和党参议员瓦金斯说：“我完全不同意杜鲁门。”参院共和党领袖惠利支持胡佛的演说，并要求撤换艾奇逊，他说：这是“为了全国团结的利益”。惠利说，艾奇逊的外交政策已失败了。美国人民也和“对美国友好的”各国人民一样，不信任艾奇逊了。
    彼此互相攻击，现在已成为侵略者内部的家常便饭了。共和党头子之一马丁说：“现在是我们彻底讨论并重行审查我们的计划和责任的时候了。”甚至国务院公共事务司司长罗塞尔也不得不说：“我们正处在最严重的危机之中”，“应该考查一下，我们的领导和我们的政策是不是好，应该怎样才好”。然而，美帝国主义又怎能找到行得通的侵略路线呢？
