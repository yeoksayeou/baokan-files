Cheers at Midnight
    A Record of Peking University Students' Parade Celebrating the Liberation of Seoul

    The sky-filled cheers shattered the silence of the snowy night in the capital.

    Yesterday, around 20:20, students from the Peking University Law Department and Western Languages Department, who were in a meeting, cheered for a piece of good news that came somewhat suddenly: "Seoul has been liberated!" Some students jumped onto the tables. The grand event of sending off the second batch of students to participate in the military cadre school immediately developed into a celebration parade.

    "The Chinese and Korean People's troops are winning battles in the freezing weather, we should celebrate in the freezing weather!" The students who poured into Democracy Square quickly and busily formed a parade.

    The huge red flag of "Celebrating the Liberation of Seoul" was unfurled, which had been prepared two days earlier. Seeing the American invading army's embarrassing retreat, the students anticipated that this victorious news would not be too far off.

    The female students in the gray building, the students in the Third Courtyard and the West Dormitory, also jumped up from their dreams, banging and shaking basins and bells, creating a cacophony of sounds. Some students rushed into the courtyard without even having time to put on their shoes and socks properly.

    The 700-person parade set off towards Wangfujing. Two torches leading the way illuminated the bright red light. Ma Chaoqun, a Korean lecturer from the Department of Eastern Languages, was in the procession, cheering happily for the liberation of his motherland's capital. More than a dozen teaching assistants from various departments, as well as Zhang Dazhong, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Wang Jialiu, Minister of the University Department, who had come from afar, all joined the parade.

    The people of Beijing were awakened by this unexpected good news. As the procession passed through Wangfujing Street, the neon lights of Dong'an Market cast a pink glow on the snowy ground. Shop assistants leaned out of the glass windows, standing on the upper floors, waving and applauding the parade. The students knocked on every brightly lit store, announcing the good news to them: "Seoul has been liberated!"

    On every street they passed, the police officers who were patrolling the snowy night to protect the safety of the people of the capital applauded and cheered the parade. Approaching pedicabs, the sound of their bells imitated the rhythm of the Yangko drum music, "Great! Seoul has been liberated!" They stopped their vehicles and cheered with the students, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live General Kim Il-sung!"

    When the parade returned to the Peking University campus at Sha Tan, it was already past one o'clock. Zhong Liqing, Vice Chairman of the Student Union, spoke amidst applause: "We have said long ago that the Chinese and Korean people are as close as flesh and blood, their victory is our victory, and we will always be victorious!" He announced to the students amidst cheers: "Prepare to celebrate even greater victories!"

　　午夜的欢声
    记北大同学庆祝汉城光复游行
    萧航
    漫天的欢呼声，震破了首都雪夜的寂静。
    昨天，约摸二十时二十分钟，正在开会的北大法律系、西语系同学，为一个来得有些突然的喜讯而欢呼：“汉城解放了！”有的同学跳上了桌子。欢送二批同学参加军事干部学校的盛会立即发展成为庆祝游行了。
    “中朝人民部队在冰天雪地里打胜仗，我们应该在冰天雪地里来庆祝！”一齐涌向民主广场的同学们，迅速而匆忙地组成了游行队伍。
    “庆祝汉城解放”的巨幅红旗扯出来了，这是在两天以前准备好的。同学们看到美国侵略军的狼狈溃退，预计着这个胜利消息不会太远。
    在睡梦中的灰楼女同学，三院和西斋的同学们也跳起来了，脸盆、铃，连敲带摇，响成一片。有的同学来不及穿好鞋袜，就涌到院子里来了。
    七百人的游行队伍向王府井出发。作为前导的两把火炬，照耀着明亮的红光。队伍里有朝鲜籍的东语系讲师马超群，他为祖国京城的解放而欣喜欢呼。各系的十多位助教，还有远道赶来的北京市团工委副书记张大中、大学部部长汪家镠，一齐参加了游行的队伍。
    北京市的人民为这意外的喜讯所唤醒。当队伍穿过王府井大街的时候，东安市场的霓虹灯，把雪地映成一片粉红。店员们探身到玻璃窗外，站立在楼上，向游行的队伍扬手，鼓掌。同学们敲遍了每一座放射着灯光的商店，向他们报喜：“汉城解放了！”
    在他们走过的每一条街上，正为保卫首都人民安全而在雪夜巡逻的警士，都向游行队伍鼓掌欢呼。迎面来的三轮车，车铃声模仿着扭秧歌的锣鼓节奏，“好呵！汉城解放了！”他们停下车子，和同学们一齐欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“金日成将军万岁！”
    当游行队伍回到沙滩北大的时候，已经是下一点了。学生会副主席钟历清在掌声中讲话：“我们早就说过，中朝人民血肉相连，他们的胜利就是我们的胜利，我们永远是胜利的！”他在欢呼声中预告同学们：“为庆祝更大的胜利作准备呵！”
