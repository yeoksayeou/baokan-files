　　Beijing Railway Bureau Electrification Section and Other Units
    Launch Comfort and Relief Campaign
    Employee Lao Ruisen Donates 4.5 Million Yuan
    [Our Newspaper] The employees of the Beijing Railway Bureau Electrification Section enthusiastically responded to the call of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's forces and relieve Korean refugees, and generously donated. The office of only 25 people donated 7.36 million yuan in just ten minutes, of which Lao Ruisen alone donated 4.5 million yuan. The 25 people also decided to write a letter each to comfort the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean fighters at the front.
    The Technical Surveying Class of the Cadre School of the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry held group discussions on the evening of the 15th regarding the call of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's forces and relieve Korean refugees, and decided to donate all 700,000 yuan saved from the class's food expenses. At the same time, each student enthusiastically donated what clothes and money they could, and in just one and a half hours, cotton-padded clothes, leather clothes, scarves, cotton shoes, etc., filled the entire office. Most of the students in the class receive supply-system treatment, and their lives are relatively difficult. This spirit of patriotism and internationalism is worthy of praise.
    Yin Yiming, a student at the Beijing Russian Language School, donated cotton-padded coats and other items to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's forces and relieve Korean refugees. In a letter to this newspaper on the 15th, he wrote: "...This comfort and relief movement is completely just and in accordance with the will of the Chinese people who love the people, love the motherland, and love peace. I would very much like to donate some cash, but I don't have any right now. I am now taking out seven prize-winning savings certificates (10,000 yuan each), a cotton-padded coat, a new pair of leather shoes, and a new pair of socks to express my feelings. I will send the seven prize-winning savings certificates first, please forward them; the other cotton-padded clothes, etc., I do not have time to send because I am preparing for the exam, so I will give them to the school's Communist Youth League headquarters!" Yin Yiming concluded his letter by saying: "The power of the people of our New China is great, and we, as people of the New China, have an obligation to enthusiastically participate in this movement."

　　北京铁路分局电务段等单位
    展开慰劳救济运动     
    职工老瑞森捐款四十五万元
    【本报讯】北京铁路分局电务段职工，热烈响应中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会关于慰劳中朝人民部队并救济朝鲜难民的号召，纷纷解囊捐献。仅办公室二十五人，在十分钟内即献出人民币七十三万六千元，其中老瑞森一人就献款四十五万元。该二十五人并决定每人写信一封，慰问朝鲜人民及前线中朝战士。
    中央人民政府重工业部干部学校技术测定班，十五日晚上分组讨论我国保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会关于慰劳中朝人民部队和救济朝鲜难民的号召，决定将该班伙食节约的七十万元全部献出。同时，每个同学都踊跃献出了自己所能拿出来的衣服和金钱，在短短的一个半小时内，棉衣、皮衣、围巾，棉鞋等就堆满了整个办公室。该班学员大部分是供给制待遇，生活还比较艰苦，这种爱国主义与国际主义的精神，值得表扬。
    北京俄文专修学校殷一鸣同学，捐献棉大衣等慰劳中朝人民部队和救济朝鲜难民。他在十五日给本报的信中写道：“……这个慰劳和救济运动完全是正义的，是合乎爱人民、爱祖国、爱和平的中国人民的意志的。我很想拿出一些现金来，可是现在没有。我现在拿出七张有奖储蓄券（每张一万元）、棉大衣一件、新皮鞋一双、新洋袜一双，表示我的一点心意。现在先把七张有奖储蓄券寄去，请代转寄；其他棉大衣等因正准备考试，没有时间送去，就交给本校团总部吧！”殷一鸣同学的信最后说：“我们新中国的人民力量是伟大的，我们做一个新中国人民，都有义务来热烈参加这个运动。”
