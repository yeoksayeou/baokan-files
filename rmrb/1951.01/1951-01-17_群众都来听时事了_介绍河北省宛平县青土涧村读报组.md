　　The masses all come to listen to current events
　　--Introducing the Reading Group of Qingtu Jian Village, Wanping County, Hebei Province
　　Shi Fuhui
　　The reading group of Qingtu Jian Village, Wanping County, Hebei Province, was formed by five people including village cadres and elementary school teachers, and has now grown to twenty-eight people. In the beginning, everyone's enthusiasm for learning from the newspapers was not great. Later, they changed their approach by reading the newspaper to the masses in places where they often gathered to chat. The number of listeners gradually increased, and before each reading, they would sing a passage of ballad, and start reading the newspaper when enough people had arrived.

　　In July of last year, the reading group was unified under the leadership of the village propaganda and education committee. The propaganda and education committee held a meeting every ten days to discuss propaganda and education work, and a joint meeting of the heads of the reading group, wall newspaper team, and broadcasting group every seven days to discuss propaganda and education work.

　　The reading group members often selected materials from the newspapers and, in combination with the actual situation of the local area, compiled small entertainment programs such as clapper talks, yangge dances, drums, dramas, skits, songs, local operas, and peep shows, performing them every few days. The participants numbered no less than eighty or ninety people. Every time a program was performed, a comrade from the reading group, who was also an elementary school teacher, would explain the newspaper to the audience in a speech. Because the content of the performances and the reading were the same, the masses understood it more deeply, and thus gained the support of the masses for the reading group.

　　Zhang Guoxian, an elderly man in the village, was very backward. In the past, he was always unwilling to attend meetings, but now, as soon as he hears about reading the newspaper or a performance, he runs over early to wait. He also often asks the reading group for news. Especially after the village suffered a flood last year, the morale of the masses was generally low, and they felt that they could not survive. The reading group immediately adapted the drama "Production for Self-Relief" based on the policy of production for self-relief, combined with the actual situation of the village, which resolved the ideological concerns of the masses. The next day, the masses went to the fields to sow buckwheat again. The masses said: "What's the use of being pessimistic? The more disasters there are, the more we must work hard to produce."

　　群众都来听时事了
    ——介绍河北省宛平县青土涧村读报组
    史福辉
    河北省宛平县青土涧村读报组是由村干部和小学教员等五人组成，现在已经发展到二十八个人了。开始，大家学习报纸的劲头不大。后来，改变了一下方式，就是在群众经常集中谈天的地方给群众读报。听的人逐渐增多了，并且每逢读报前先唱一段鼓词，等人来的多了就开始读报。
    去年七月间，读报组统一归村宣教委员会领导，宣教委员会每十天开一次会讨论宣教工作，每七天召集一次读报组、墙报股、广播组长的联席会，讨论宣教工作。
    读报组的人就经常选择报上的材料并结合本地方的实际情况，编成快板、秧歌、大鼓、话剧、双簧、歌曲、落子、拉洋片等的小型娱乐节目，隔几天出演一次，参加者不下八、九十人。每演出一个节目时，即由读报的小学教员同志用讲话方式给听众讲解报纸。由于演出节目和读报的内容是一样的，群众体会得就更深刻，也就获得了群众对读报组的拥护。
    该村老年张国贤很落后，过去一向不愿参加会议的，现在一听到读报或演出的时候，他早早就跑来等着。并且常向读报小组的人打听消息。特别是去年该村闹水灾之后，群众情绪普遍不高，认为无法活下去了。读报组当即根据生产自救的方针，结合本村的实际情况，编演了“生产自救”的话剧，解决了群众的思想顾虑。第二天群众都又上地里播种荞麦去了。群众们说：“悲观有什么用，越闹灾情越得好好生产。”
