Looking at the Plunder of Our Country's "National Treasures" by American Imperialism from the Exhibition of Pictures on Resisting America and Aiding Korea
Zhu Bo
At the Exhibition of Pictures on Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Defending Our Homes and Country, organized by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Imperialist Aggression, there are dozens of particularly eye-catching photographs that vividly depict the scene of American imperialism plundering our country's cultural relics. Those sculptures, buildings, paintings, ceramics, bronzes... all of historical value are ancient works of art from our country, the crystallization of our ancestors' labor. Now, these priceless treasures have all been seized by American imperialism.

American imperialism's plunder of our country's cultural relics began as early as the Opium War. Since then, American imperialists, with gunboats as their vanguard and gold coins as their means, have, through the corrupt Qing government, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government, as well as comprador bureaucrats, rogue scholars, and treacherous merchants, stolen many of our country's "national treasures" that cannot be valued in money.

Here is a photo of an ancient Chinese artistic building - the "Stone Treasure". This is a "Stone Treasure" from the third year of Xiaochang in the Northern Wei Dynasty (527 AD). This small house is entirely carved from a kind of stone. The four walls of the house are carved with very detailed pictures. This not only represents the architectural model of the Northern Wei Dynasty, but also represents the artistic level of sculpture and painting at that time. Now, this priceless treasure is displayed in the Boston Museum in the United States. Another photo is of two of the "Six Steeds of Zhaoling" from our country, displayed in the Philadelphia Museum in the United States. The "Six Steeds of Zhaoling" are famous sculptures of the Tang Dynasty. Each steed weighs about five tons. These were commissioned by Emperor Taizong of Tang to commemorate his six warhorses, and he had famous sculptors of the time carve them on his tomb. During the Qing Dynasty, an American colluded with a Chinese traitor at the time to steal it. The remaining four steeds had also been sawn into several sections in preparation for transportation, but the theft was prevented due to the opposition of the local people. However, the horses were damaged, the arrows carved on the horses were sawn off, and Emperor Taizong's personal inscription was also blurred. The ancient sculptures exhibited here also include ancient reliefs from the Yangdong Cave in the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang. The reliefs on the left and right walls were stolen by American imperialism: the right wall is embedded in the walls of the Ganser City Museum, and the left wall is now embedded in the walls of the New York City Museum. The flying apsaras in the Tianlongshan Grottoes near Taiyuan, Shanxi, are the works of famous sculptors from the Northern Qi Dynasty. Some of the flying apsaras were stolen by American imperialism and displayed in the Fogg Museum, and many of the others that were not stolen were also damaged by American imperialism.

There is a photo of the panoramic view of the Chinese Antiquities Exhibition Room in the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the United States. All the ancient cultural relics inside were stolen from China, and all the building materials in the exhibition room were also plundered from China. In addition, in 1929, the American oil tycoon Rockefeller moved an ancient Lama temple in Suiyuan Province, China, and held a public exhibition in Chicago. From the photos, we can see that in the Ganser City Museum, the ceiling of a house is inlaid with a fully painted "caisson" woodwork, which was stolen by American imperialism from the Zhihua Temple in Beijing, China. This "caisson" is from the Wanfo Pavilion in Zhihua Temple. Zhihua Temple is a building from the Ming Dynasty, and the style of the "caisson" and the paintings on it all represent the style of the Ming Dynasty.

From many photos, it can be clearly seen that many ancient bronzes from our country were stolen by American imperialism. Here are gilt-inlaid incense burners and gilt-inlaid pots from the Warring States period, bronze figures from the Warring States period, and "Fan Jin" (wine vessels) from the Shang Dynasty. Fan Jin, this is the only set of ancient wine vessels in our country, unearthed in Shaanxi during the Qing Dynasty. At that time, it was seized by a governor named Duanfang during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty by using his authority. In the early years of the Republic of China, it was bought by Ferguson, an American advisor to the then Beiyang government. Now, this set of "Fan Jin" is displayed in the New York City Museum. There are also "Bronze You" from the Shang Dynasty, "Bronze Bowls" from the early Zhou Dynasty, etc. In total, there are no less than a thousand fine works from the Shang Dynasty to the Han Dynasty, which are displayed in various museums in the United States.

The number of ancient paintings plundered by American imperialism is also very alarming. Among the more than ten ancient paintings exhibited this time, there are "Portraits of Emperors of the Past Dynasties" painted by Yan Liben, a famous painter of the Tang Dynasty, "Lin Qiu Ji Tu" by Dong Yuanping, a famous painter of the Five Dynasties, "Luoshen Tu" painted by Gu Kaizhi, a famous painter of the Jin Dynasty, and "Beiqi School Book Chart" by Yan Liben of the Tang Dynasty modeled by people of the Northern Song Dynasty… All these famous paintings were stolen by American imperialism in collusion with traitors and treacherous merchants. "Portraits of Emperors of the Past Dynasties" by Yan Liben of the Tang Dynasty is 51.3 cm high and 531 cm long. The picture has images of thirteen emperors from Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty to Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty. This is the most precious Chinese figure painting. This picture can help with historical research in many places. In addition, there are many inscriptions by famous people of the Song Dynasty on the back of the picture. Later, the traitor Liang Hongzhi stole the picture and sold it to American imperialism. It is now displayed in the Boston Museum. "Lin Qiu Ji Tu" by Dong Yuanping of the Five Dynasties was stolen by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1912. This painting has reached the highest artistic level in terms of brushwork and picture structure. This is an important national treasure and is now displayed in the Boston Museum. The largest theft of ancient paintings by American imperialism was the theft of murals from the Thousand Buddha Caves in 1923. At that time, Harvard University sent Warner and others to the Thousand Buddha Caves in the name of archeology, and used foreign cloth and glue to stick off more than 20 murals and steal several clay Buddhist statues from the Tang Dynasty. The Thousand Buddha Caves are located in Dunhuang County, Gansu Province. The murals in the Thousand Buddha Caves were all painted by famous painters of the Tang Dynasty. In 1925, Warner came to China again, attempting to steal all the murals and other historical and valuable cultural relics from the Thousand Buddha Caves. At that time, because of the opposition of the local people, Warner failed to achieve his stealing purpose. However, many Tang Dynasty Buddhist statues were damaged by him.

From the pictures in the exhibition, ancient Chinese porcelain from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties also appeared in various museums in the United States, totaling more than 10,000 pieces. For example, the New York City Museum displays Chinese ceramics from the Six Dynasties. The Chinese Ceramics Exhibition Room of the National Museum of the United States in Washington contains many famille noire porcelains from the Kangxi period. The essence of these Chinese porcelain from past dynasties is now difficult to see in our country.

The photos in this exhibition are only a small part of the cultural relics that American imperialism has plundered from our country. In recent decades, American imperialism has become the biggest culprit in the world for plundering our country's cultural relics. The number of plundered items is so large that it is difficult to calculate. Looking at the photos, many museums in various parts of the United States have established Chinese Antiquities Exhibition Rooms, such as the Chinese Sculpture Exhibition Room of the New York City Museum, the Chinese Antiquities Exhibition Room of the Ganser City Museum, the Chinese Antiquities Exhibition Room of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, etc. Each exhibition room has dozens to hundreds of cultural relics of historical value from our country. The Chinese people will not forget this ugly crime of American imperialism.

　　从抗美援朝图片展览会上看美帝掠夺我国的“国宝”
    朱波
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美帝侵略委员会举办的抗美援朝保家卫国图片展览会上，有数十幅特别引人注目的照片，生动地描写了美帝国主义掠夺我国文物的情景。那些具有历史价值的雕塑、建筑、绘画、陶瓷、铜器………全是我国古代的艺术品，是我们祖先的劳动结晶。现在，这些无价之宝，全给美帝攫夺去了。
    美帝国主义掠夺我国文物，早在鸦片战争时期就开始了。从那时起，美帝国主义者以炮舰为先导，以金圆为手段，通过满清政府、蒋介石卖国政府、以及买办官僚、流氓学者、奸商等，把我国很多不能以金钱计值的“国宝”盗取了去。
    这里有一幅中国古代艺术建筑——“石宝”的照片，这是北魏孝昌三年（公元五百二十七年）的一座“石宝”。这座小房子完全是用一种石头雕刻而成的。房子的四壁，都雕刻成非常细致的图画。这不仅代表了北魏时期的建筑模型，而且代表了当时的雕刻、图画等的艺术水平。现在，这一无价之宝，陈列在美国波斯顿博物院里。另一幅照片，是陈列在美国费城博物院的我国“昭陵六骏”中的两骏。“昭陵六骏”是唐朝的名雕刻。每骏的重量约五吨。这是唐太宗为纪念其六匹有战功的骏马，请当时的名雕刻家雕刻在他的坟墓上的。在清朝的时候，有一个美国人勾结当时的一个汉奸把它盗走了。其余四骏也已经锯成数节准备运走，因为当地人民的反对，未能偷走。但是骏马被破坏了，马身上雕刻的箭已遭锯折，唐太宗的亲笔题词也已模糊不清。这里展览的古代雕刻，还有洛阳龙门山窟阳洞的古代浮雕，其中左右两壁的浮雕，均被美帝盗走：右壁嵌在甘泽滋城博物院的墙壁上，左壁现在嵌在纽约市博物院的墙壁上。山西太原附近天龙山石窟的飞仙，是北齐时代名雕刻家的作品，其中有的飞仙被美帝盗走，陈列在福格博物院，其它未被盗走的也多被美帝破坏了。
    有一幅照片，是美国裴勒台非亚博物院中国古物陈列室的全景。这里面的全部古代文物都是从中国窃盗走的，而陈列室的全部建筑器材，也都是从中国掠夺去的。另外，在一九二九年，美国石油大王罗克斐勒，曾经在我国绥远省搬走一座古代建筑的喇嘛寺，并在芝加哥举行过公开展览。从照片里，我们看见甘泽滋城博物院里，有一所房子的天花板上，嵌着一个全部彩绘“藻井”木作，这是美帝从我国北京智化寺盗走的。此“藻井”乃是智化寺内万佛阁上的。智化寺是明朝时代的建筑，“藻井”的样式及上面的绘画，都代表了明朝的风格。
    从很多照片中，可以很清楚地看到被美帝盗走的我国许多古代铜器，这里有战国时期的错金薰炉、错金壶，战国时期的铜人，还有商朝的“柉禁”（酒具）。柉禁，这是我国仅有的一副古代酒具，满清时代在陕西出土。当时就为清朝光绪年间的一个名叫端方的巡抚，利用职权把此古物夺走。民国初年，被当时的北洋政府的美国顾问福开森买走。现在，这副“柉禁”陈列在纽约市博物院。其它还有商朝的“铜卣”，周朝初期的“铜钵”等。总计自商朝至汉朝时期的精品，不下千余件，分别陈列在美国各博物院里。
    美帝掠夺我国古画之多，也是很惊人的。这次展览的十余幅古画中，有唐朝名画家阎立本所画的“历代帝王图”，五代名画家董源平的“林秋霁图”，宋人摹晋朝名画家顾恺之所画“洛神图”，北宋人临唐代阎立本北齐校书图……等，所有这些名画，都被美帝勾结汉奸、奸商盗走了。唐代阎立本的“历代帝王图”，画面高五一·三公分，长五三一公分，该图有自汉明帝起至隋炀帝止共十三个帝王的图像，这是中国人物画中最宝贵的一幅，该图有很多地方可以帮助历史考证，另外，图的后面，并有很多宋代名人的题字。后来，该图被汉奸梁鸿志偷走，卖给了美帝国主义，现在陈列在波斯顿博物院。五代董源平林秋霁图，在一九一二年被波斯顿美术馆盗走。该画不论在笔法上或图画的结构上，都达到了最高的艺术水平，这是一件重要的国宝，现在陈列在波斯顿博物院。美帝盗取我国古画最大的一次，是一九二三年，盗取千佛洞壁画的事件。当时，美国哈佛大学派遣华尔纳等人以考古为名，到达千佛洞，用洋布和胶水粘去壁画二十余方，并偷走数尊唐代土塑佛像。千佛洞在甘肃省敦煌县，千佛洞内的壁画都是唐代名画家绘制的。一九二五年华尔纳又来中国，企图把千佛洞所有的壁画及其它有历史价值的文物全部偷走。当时，因为当地人民的反对，使华尔纳未能达到其偷盗的目的。但是很多唐代佛像遭到他的破坏。
    从展览的图片中看到，我国宋、元、明、清等古代瓷器，也出现在美国各博物院中，总数达万余件。如纽约市博物院中即陈列着我国六朝的陶瓷。华盛顿美国国立博物院中国陶瓷陈列室内，有很多是康熙年间出品的墨底五彩瓷器。这些中国历代瓷器的精华，在我国国内已经很难看到了。
    这次展览的照片，仅是美帝掠夺我国文物中很少的一部分。近几十年来，美帝国主义已成为世界上掠夺我国文物的最大罪魁。掠夺的数目之大，是很难计算的。从照片上看，美国各地的博物院，很多都设立了中国古物陈列室，如纽约市博物院的中国雕塑陈列室，甘泽滋城博物院中国古物陈列室，裴勒台尔非亚博物院的中国古物陈列室，……等。每个陈列室，都有数十至数百件我国具有历史价值的文物。美帝国主义这种丑恶的罪行，中国人民是不会忘记的。
