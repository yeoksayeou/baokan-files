　　The people of the Capital, Northeast, Northwest and other places
    Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Telegram to the United Nations
    [Report from this newspaper] People in various regions warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram to the First Committee of the United Nations on the 17th, as well as the four proposals put forward therein regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other Far Eastern issues.
    In the capital, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce issued statements respectively. The statement of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party stated: The First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly illegally adopted various principles concerning Korea and other Far Eastern issues without the participation of the representative of the People's Republic of China. Its basic spirit is to attempt to allow US imperialism to continue to maintain its base of aggression and use it to continue to expand aggression under the smokescreen of the so-called "ceasefire proposal." This is fundamentally different from the repeated statements of our Central People's Government regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The four proposals put forward by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai this time are fully in line with the will of the entire Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party vows to take active actions to support these four proposals. The statement of the Jiusan Society stated: Although US imperialism has recently suffered an unprecedented defeat in Korea by the aggressive army it led, it has therefore instructed the United Nations to pass a so-called ceasefire proposal; however, judging from the proposal itself and the series of measures taken by US imperialism to invade Taiwan, aid the Vietnamese puppet Bảo Đại, and attempt to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, US imperialism obviously has no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and related major issues in Asia. We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's four proposals and will step up support for the heroic soldiers on the Korean front. If the invading army of US imperialism does not withdraw from Korea, it will be resolutely annihilated. The statement of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce stated: We, the industrial and commercial circles in the capital, unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram and its four proposals, and believe that the United Nations and relevant countries can only peacefully resolve the Korean and Asian issues by accepting these four proposals. All students of Northern Jiaotong University Beijing Railway College and all staff and students of the National No. 1 Midwifery School immediately studied and discussed this important document after seeing Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the First Committee of the United Nations. Everyone unanimously believes that Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram once again reiterated the just position of the Chinese people, expressed the demands of all peace-loving people, pointed out the way to truly peacefully resolve the Korean issue and important issues in Asia, and more forcefully exposed the US imperialists' conspiracy to continue aggression in Korea and Asia by means of the so-called "ceasefire first, then negotiation."
    People's organizations such as the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Northeast Women's Federation have issued statements, believing that Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the First Committee of the United Nations is the most correct plan for quickly ending the Korean War and peacefully resolving the Far East issue. Only negotiations among relevant countries on the basis of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the settlement of Korean internal affairs by the Korean people themselves can quickly end the Korean War. People from all walks of life in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Rehe provinces also unanimously support the principles and opinions put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou in his telegram to the United Nations. People's organizations such as workers, youth, women, and industry and commerce circles in Andong City, which suffered from the bombing and strafing of US imperialism, issued a statement saying: We are close neighbors of Korea living on the right bank of the Yalu River and have personally suffered the disasters caused by US imperialism. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal and strive for the realization of true peace.
    People in the Northwest region and Shanxi, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong provinces, as well as the Southern Anhui region and Nanjing city, have also enthusiastically supported Foreign Minister Zhou's four proposals, believing that this important proposal truly represents the will and interests of the peace-loving people of China and Asia.

　　首都和东北西北等地人民
    拥护周外长复联合国电
    【本报讯】各地人民热烈拥护周恩来外长十七日致联合国第一委员会复电，以及其中提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题及其他远东诸问题的四项提议。
    在首都，中国农工民主党、九三学社和京市工商业联合会筹委会分别发表了声明。中国农工民主党的声明称：联合国大会第一委员会在没有我中华人民共和国代表参加的情况下，非法通过了有关朝鲜及其他远东问题的各项原则，其基本精神，是企图在所谓“停火建议”的烟幕下，使美帝继续保持其侵略的据点并借以继续扩大侵略。这跟我中央人民政府迭次声明关于和平解决朝鲜问题的主张，在本质上是完全不同的。我周恩来外长此次提出的四项建议，是完全符合全中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的意志的。中国农工民主党誓以积极行动来拥护这四项建议。九三学社的声明称：美帝国主义最近虽因他率领的侵略军在朝鲜遭受到空前的惨败，因而授意联合国通过所谓停火的建议；但从这个建议本身和美帝国主义侵略台湾，援助越南傀儡保大，以及妄图单独对日媾和这一连串的措施来看，美帝国主义对和平解决朝鲜问题和有关亚洲重大问题，显然都没有诚意。我们完全拥护周恩来外长的四项建议，并将加紧支援朝鲜前线英勇的战士。美帝国主义的侵略军如不撤出朝鲜，就坚决地消灭它。京市工商业联合会筹委会的声明称：我们首都工商界一致拥护周外长的复电及其四项提议，并认为联合国及有关国家，唯有接受这四项提议，才能和平解决朝鲜及亚洲问题。北方交通大学北京铁道学院全体同学和国立第一助产学校全体职工学员，看到周外长致联合国第一委员会的复电后，立即对此重要文献进行了学习和讨论。大家一致认为：周外长的复电又一次重申了中国人民的正义立场，表达了所有爱好和平人民的要求，指出了真正和平解决朝鲜问题和亚洲重要问题的办法，更有力地揭破了美帝想借所谓“先停战后谈判”，继续在朝鲜和亚洲进行侵略的阴谋。
    东北总工会、青年团东北委员会、东北妇女联合会等人民团体均发表声明，认为周外长致联合国第一委员会的复电，是迅速结束朝鲜战争及和平解决远东问题最正确的方案。只有在从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决的基础上举行有关各国的谈判，才能迅速结束朝鲜战争。辽东、辽西、吉林、黑龙江、松江、热河等省各界人民也一致拥护周外长致电联合国所提出的各项原则意见。遭受美帝国主义轰炸扫射的安东市工人、青年、妇女、工商界等人民团体发表声明说：我们是住在鸭绿江右岸的朝鲜近邻，曾亲身受到美帝国主义制造的灾难。我们坚决拥护周外长的提议，争取真正和平的实现。
    西北地区及山西、山东、福建、广东诸省和皖南区、南京市的人民也纷纷热烈拥护周外长的四项提议，认为此项重要提议真正代表了全中国和全亚洲爱好和平人民的意志与利益。
