Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The U.S. imperialists, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Korean people, are forcibly drawing blood from Japanese laborers to transfuse wounded U.S. soldiers in the Korean War. According to a United Press report, Hidehiko Isobe, Director of the Agricultural Improvement Bureau of the Yoshida government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, revealed that the Yoshida government had issued instructions to various ministries, ordering them to "assist in blood donation work for UN forces" (referring to the U.S. aggressor troops). This vampire-like atrocity has already been carried out in Japanese factories. On November 28th of last year, the management department of Tokyo's Nippon Tire Company ordered the factory's workers to "provide blood to UN forces." This was immediately met with angry rejection from all the workers. The management department shamelessly threatened the workers with "dismissal" and forcibly carried out the blood draw. Some public servants residing in Narimasu, Itabashi Ward, Tokyo, were also forcibly subjected to blood draws.

　　美军强抽日人血液输给侵朝受伤美军
    【新华社十一日讯】双手沾满朝鲜人民的鲜血的美帝国主义者，竟强制抽取日本劳动人民的血液，输给在侵朝战争中受伤的美军。据联合通讯社消息：据吉田政府农林省农业改良局长矶边秀俊透露，吉田政府曾向各省（部）发出指令，命令它们“协助对联合国军（按指美国侵略军）伤病人员的献血工作”。这一吸血鬼的暴行，已在日本工厂进行。东京日本车胎公司的管理部，在去年十一月二十八日命令该工厂的工人“向联合国军提供血液”。当场曾遭到全体工人愤慨的拒绝。管理部竟无耻地以“开除”威胁工人，强制实行抽血。住在东京板桥区成增地方的若干机关勤务员，也曾被强制抽血。
