    Hebei Daming Straw Braid Factory Manager
    Bureaucratic Work Style Should Be Corrected
    The straw braid factory of the Daming County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei was established in the spring of last year. It has a total of more than 140 employees. The factory's production involves collecting straw braids produced by farmers in Qingfeng, Nanle, and other counties as sideline production, straightening and whitening them, and then transporting them for sale to Tianjin and other places. The factory has consistently lacked a democratic management system, and the administrative personnel do not care about the welfare of the workers. Manager Chen Xiuxiang acts arbitrarily and does not consult with the trade union on matters. Production lacks planning; when there is work, the workers are asked to go to work in the middle of the night, and when there is no work, they rest. Chen Xiuxiang rarely goes to the workshop on weekdays and sits in his room all day. When trade union cadres want to talk to him about something, he says, "You can't just enter this room casually. You have to have the messenger inform me first, and I have to tell you to come in before you can come in." Both doors of the workshop are broken. The windows are not papered. The cracks in the walls are so wide that people can be seen from the inside and outside, and it is basically open to the elements. When it rains, the roof leaks, and the ground is so wet that the mats are moldy. The workers work in such conditions. In winter, there is no fire in the workshop, and the workers' hands are chapped from the cold. When they raise the issue, the administration asks the workers to pay for the fire themselves. There are no sprayers for spraying the straw braids, so the workers have to spray them with their mouths, and in the winter they still use cold water. The workers' mouths are chapped from the cold, and they asked to use warm water. The administrative head said, "There are no conditions; the well water is not cold." Initially, the factory did not provide boiled water for the workers to drink. Later, after the workers raised the issue, water tickets were issued, allowing them to fetch water from a small teahouse outside the factory. It takes more than ten minutes to fetch a pot of water. The workers are afraid of delaying their work and do not go to fetch water when they are thirsty. This method is actually not allowing the workers to drink water. The wages are often paid in moldy red sorghum. Once, at the request of the workers, some corn was purchased from the supply and marketing cooperative and distributed to the workers. Manager Chen then said to the workers: "This is my doing, don't forget me; forgetting me is being ungrateful." In the past few months, due to the lack of supply of raw materials, work was often suspended. Trade union cadres raised the issue with the administration: "Are we still going to do this? If we are, we should study production carefully. This way, the workers' lives cannot be sustained." The factory's deputy manager said, "It's not that we're not doing it; whatever happens, happens. I earn this much millet a month anyway; it's the same whether I work or not." This irresponsible attitude towards the people's enterprise and the workers cannot lead the factory to improve production.
    The factory does not implement government decrees. For example, the Trade Union Law stipulates that the administration should allocate 2% of the total wages of all employees to the trade union as trade union funds on a monthly basis, but the factory refuses to implement this. The medical expenses for workers' injuries and illnesses have not been properly resolved. The trade union has been requesting an office for more than half a year, but there has been no response. On the day of the National Day holiday last year, workers who did not attend the meeting at the factory were not paid. Because female worker Yang Yuqin was pregnant, the trade union did not allow her to attend the general assembly, and the administration refused to pay her wages as a result. Due to the lack of supply of raw materials, the workers were asked to gin a batch of cotton stored in the factory by the supply and marketing cooperative, but they were not paid for the work. Whenever the workers raise reasonable requests to improve production, the administration says, "This factory is of a relief nature." In fact, the factory is for production, not a relief agency. This statement is to cope with the workers and deceive them.
    In November and December of last year, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions held a temporary cadre school in the Handan area and transferred three trade union cadres from the factory for training. The manager restricted and made things difficult for them in various ways by not paying travel expenses and wages, infringing on the political rights of the trade union cadres. After much negotiation, the travel expenses were reluctantly paid. When trade union chairman Comrade Zhang Yuhua had a child, the administration did not pay her holiday wages in accordance with the law. After negotiations, only 42,000 yuan was paid.
    Based on the severity of the problems existing in the factory, I suggest that the relevant leading organs conduct a prompt inspection and handling. I also request that the inspection and handling situation and improvement results be published publicly in the newspaper.

    Editor's note: The fact that the Daming County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei province has appointed a manager, hired a large number of workers, and established a straw braid factory is a violation of the cooperative's policy. This is the same mistake as the production cooperative in Shijiazhuang that was criticized in the readers' letters column of this newspaper on January 19. In addition to the above-mentioned errors, the serious bureaucratic work style of the manager of the Daming County Supply and Marketing Cooperative's straw braid factory, who does not care about the lives of the workers and does not attach importance to the work of the trade union, should be inspected and resolutely corrected. It is hoped that the cooperative will send a letter to inform us of the results of the inspection and rectification.

### 河北大名草帽辫工厂经理  官僚主义作风应纠正

    河北大名草帽辫工厂经理
    官僚主义作风应纠正
    河北大名县供销社草帽辫工厂，是去年春季建立起来的。共有职工一百四十余人。该厂生产是收集清风、南乐等县农民副业生产的草帽辫子，经整庄、烤白后，运销天津等地。该厂一贯缺乏民主管理制度，行政负责人员不关心工人福利。经理陈修祥独断专行，有事也不和工会商量。生产缺乏计划，有了活半夜就要工人去上班，没活就歇着。陈修祥平日很少到工房去，整天坐在房里办公。工会干部有事找他谈，他说：“你们不能随随便便的进这屋，得先叫通信员传达，叫进来才能进来。”工房两扇门都坏了。窗户也不糊。墙缝裂得里外都看见人，简直是四面通风。下雨时屋顶漏水，地下湿的把铺的席都霉坏了。工人就在这样的条件下工作。冬天工房不生火，工人的手冻裂了，提出意见时，行政却要工人自己出钱生火。喷草辫子没有喷射器，让工人用嘴喷，冬天还是用冷水喷。工人的嘴冻裂了，要求改用温水。行政负责人说：“没有条件，井水不凉。”起初该厂不供给开水让工人喝。后来经工人提意见，才发给水牌，让到厂外一个小茶馆去打水。打一壶水要等十几分钟。工人怕耽误作工，渴了也不去打水喝。这种办法实际上就是不让工人喝水。工资米常发些有霉味的红粮。有一次在工人要求下，向供销社买了一部分玉米发给工人。陈经理就对工人说：“这是我的面子，你们不要忘了我；忘了就是没有良心。”前几个月因原料供给不上，时常停工。工会干部向行政上提出“我们还干不干？要干就应很好研究生产。这样工人生活不能维持。”该厂副经理说：“不是不干，怎么着就怎么着。我一个月挣这些小米反正干也是这样，不干也是这样。”这种对人民企业和工人不负责的态度，是不能领导工厂搞好生产的。
    该厂不执行政府法令，如工会法规定行政应按月拨交工会全部职工工资的百分之二作为工会经费，该厂对此拒不执行。工人伤病的医疗药费也没有很好解决。工会要求办公室，要了半年多也没有答复。去年国庆节放假那天，没到厂开会的工人就不发工资。女工杨玉琴因怀孕，工会不让她参加大会，行政上竟因此不发给她工资。厂内因原料供给不上，让工人把供销社存在厂里的一部棉花轧了，结果是白轧不给工钱。工人只要提出改进生产的合理要求，行政上即说：“这厂是带有救济性的。”实际该厂是为了搞生产，并不是什么救济机关。这种说法是为了应付工人、蒙蔽工人的。
    去年十一、二月间，省总工会在邯郸专区开办的临时干部学校，调训了该厂工会三个干部。经理竟以不发路费和工资来多方限制留难，侵犯工会干部的政治权利。后经多方交涉，才勉强发了路费。工会主席张玉花同志生了孩子，行政上也不按照法令发给假期工资。经交涉后，仅发给了四万二千元。
    根据该厂所存在问题的严重程度，我建议有关领导机关，迅速进行检查处理。并要求将检查处理情形及改进结果在报上公开发表。

    编者按：河北大名县供销社委派经理，大批雇佣工人，举办草帽辫工厂，这是违反合作社方针的。这和本报一月十九日读者来信栏所批评的石家庄的一个生产合作社是同样错误的。除上述错误外，大名县供销社草帽辫工厂经理不关心工人生活，不重视工会工作的严重官僚主义作风，应一并检查，切实纠正。并望该社将检查整顿结果来信告知。
