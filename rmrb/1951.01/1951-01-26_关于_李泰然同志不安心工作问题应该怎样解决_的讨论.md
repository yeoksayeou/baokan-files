　　Discussion on How to Solve Comrade Li Tairan's Problem of Not Being Secure in His Work
    Ming Duo

    (I) Is it permissible to be arrogant and complacent with minor achievements?

    For a Communist Party member, working for the Party and the people and making achievements in work is one's duty. Like Comrade Li Tairan: studying radio diligently, doing the work of six people with four during marches, and completing work tasks in a tense combat environment. This is worthy of commendation and learning. The great victory of the Chinese revolution was achieved because such Party members united all the people and worked hard in various positions.

    But for a Communist Party member, can one be arrogant and complacent with such minor achievements? Like Comrade Li Tairan: because he is skilled in technology and has completed the tasks assigned by the Party, he is arrogant, looks down on others, and boasts about himself; because the materials he compiled are published in the newspaper, he is arrogant and complacent and no longer studies humbly. This is not right. A Communist Party member should work harder than others and make certain work achievements. This is to realize a communist society. It is not easy to realize a communist society. It is an unprecedentedly great and arduous cause in human history. This cause can only be realized by our Party members uniting all the people and engaging in long-term unremitting struggle. This makes it clear! These minor personal achievements, even greater achievements, are just "a drop in the ocean" compared to the communist cause we are striving for. What is there to be proud and complacent about?

    People who are arrogant, conceited, and do not study humbly are bound to have loopholes in their work (even if some people do not have loopholes now, it is only a matter of time). Comrade Li Tairan's rashly answering questions about studying the Land Reform Law in a training class is a good lesson. After being criticized, Comrade Li Tairan responded to work passively, complained, and wanted to transfer work. Superficially, this is "inferiority," but in reality, it is another manifestation of Comrade Li Tairan's arrogance.

    It should be pointed out that Comrade Li Tairan's arrogance is a reflection of petty-bourgeois consciousness. A small producer is like this: living on his own ability, working actively to maintain his position, and boasting to others after achieving some success. A Communist Party member should not have this kind of thinking. It is hoped that Comrade Li Tairan will overcome this kind of thinking.

    However, it should also be mentioned in passing that there are quite a few comrades who have the same kind of thinking as Comrade Li Tairan. Therefore, I suggest that these comrades should also, in discussing Comrade Li Tairan's problem, contact and examine their own thinking, resolve to transform themselves, and do more work for the Party.

    Finally, we should bear in mind what Comrade Stalin said: "What makes the Bolshevik glorious is not pride but humility."

  (II) Look Forward, Catch Up with the Needs of the Situation
    Sun Zhiwei

    Comrade Li Tairan has forgotten the attitude of diligent study and striving for progress that a Communist Party member should have. Judging from Comrade Li Tairan's performance, although he worked very hard when studying radio in the past, he only paid attention to the study of professional skills, and he still relaxed and belittled political and cultural studies. As a result, he increased his purely technical point of view, gradually alienated himself from politics, and could not improve himself politically. As a result, he lacked the correct attitude towards work, criticism, and learning, and promoted the development of the idea of ​​considering himself a meritorious person.

    In this way, Comrade Li Tairan inevitably overestimated himself, thinking that he was already "amazing."

    In this way, Comrade Li Tairan inevitably looks backward instead of forward, always thinking: "I used to be a good cadre, able to overcome difficulties, complete tasks, and receive praise and praise." "I can't do this job, let's go back to my original profession!" And he did not think about how much effort he needs to make to study "now" and "in the future." What he knew in the past is no longer suitable for the needs of today's situation, and what he doesn't know needs to be learned urgently.

    Therefore, Comrade Li Tairan should no longer adopt the negative attitude of "if you think it won't work, then transfer my job," but should humbly study hard, look forward, and catch up with the needs of the situation. Only in this way can Comrade Li Tairan do his job well; otherwise, even if he is transferred a hundred times, he will still not be able to do his job well.

  (III) Comrade Li Tairan Should Start Learning from Scratch Editor Comrade:

    I was very touched after reading the reader's letter about Comrade Li Tairan's lack of peace of mind in his work. Because my personal heroism is more deeply rooted than Comrade Li Tairan's, and the mistakes are more serious. I would like to exchange some ideas with Comrade Li Tairan here.

    When I was around the time I joined the Party, I was very complacent because I had made some progress in my work and study. I thought: "I am eager to make progress and transform myself. Now, apart from some arrogance, I can't be considered a bad Communist Party member." Who knew that when I recently made a semester-end summary, many classmates gave opinions on my work style. For example, because my attitude towards the leadership was not good, some students thought that I was "in power," so they were afraid of offending me and not being able to join the Party or the League. This learning summary made me nervous for a week and unable to sleep at night. It made me realize more deeply my arrogance and the harm it caused to the Party and the work, and hindered my progress. It was like waking up from a dream, finally recognizing myself, and realizing that if I don't overcome arrogance, although subjectively I am serving the people, it is actually impossible, because you are manipulated by individualistic thoughts, and all work is always developing in a direction suitable for personal heroism.

    I think: The main reason for arrogance is not understanding "who we are working for." For example, we have not thought that the proletarian cause is great and arduous, we have not thought that many revolutionary martyrs have shed their last drop of blood for it, we have not thought that the Party's education and expectations for us are to realize the most ideal communist society for mankind; therefore, we lack a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, so we are complacent with small progress, and when we encounter difficulties, we are discouraged and do not have the courage to overcome them. Strictly speaking, this is a lack of a complete communist outlook on life.

    Comrade Li Tairan joined the Party very early and has made certain contributions to the people, which is good. However, Comrade Li Tairan has not grasped his ideological transformation tightly, and his communist outlook on life has not been well established and consolidated, so under the development of the revolutionary situation, he cannot keep up with the development of the situation, and falls behind the needs of the situation, and produces pessimistic emotions.

    Comrade Li Tairan should follow Chairman Mao's teachings: humbly start learning from scratch, overcome his personal heroism, establish a revolutionary outlook on life, and learn all the knowledge to work for the Party, and do more work for the Party and the people.
                Li Fang

  (IV) Solving the Problem of Individualism
    A Group of Students from the Party Training Class of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the CPC

    Comrade Li Tairan is an old comrade who has been tempered by more than ten years of revolution, and has performed very well in his work for a long time. It can be said that he is a good Party member. However, Comrade Li Tairan has a very strong component of individualism in his thinking. For example, he feels that he has been working for more than ten years, and now he can't even make his own decisions about writing a letter, and he is criticized for being "undisciplined and unorganized," and he feels wronged; he is even dejected, uneasy about his work, and asks to be transferred to another place to show off his skills.

    We believe that transferring work cannot solve Comrade Li Tairan's problem of not being secure in his work. Because according to Comrade Li Tairan's past work situation, he is able to do his work well. So the reason why he is not at ease with his work now is a problem of thinking, that is, he is burdened with the ideological baggage of considering himself a meritorious person. Therefore, we must solve his work problem from this root. On the other hand, the revolution is constantly moving forward. If Comrade Li Tairan cannot study hard and keep up with progress, he will never be able to do his job well. At the same time, it is not certain that he can still do his original job well. We believe that after Comrade Li Tairan's ideological problem is solved, his work problem will also be solved.

    In addition, Comrade Li Tairan has made mistakes; however, the leadership did not correct his mistakes from an ideological point of view, but adopted the method of circulating the materials he compiled, which stimulated his emotions. From a psychological and effective point of view, the adoption of this method needs to be considered.

### 关于“李泰然同志不安心工作问题应该怎样解决”的讨论

　　关于“李泰然同志不安心工作问题应该怎样解决”的讨论
    鸣铎
    （一）有了微小的成就可以骄傲自满吗？
    一个共产党员，为党为人民工作，在工作中作出一些成绩，这是自己的天职。如李泰然同志那样：下苦功学习无线电，行军中四个人作六个人的工作；在紧张战斗环境中完成工作任务。这是值得表扬、值得学习的。中国革命所以取得了伟大胜利，就因为有这样的党员团结了全体人民，在各种不同岗位上努力工作而实现的。
    但是一个共产党员，对于这样微小的成就是否就可以骄傲自满呢？如像李泰然同志那样：因为自己技术熟练，完成了党所给的任务，就目空一切，轻视别人，夸耀自己；因为自己整理的材料在报纸上发表了，就骄傲自满，不再虚心学习。这是不应该的。一个共产党员是应该与众不同地努力工作的，并要作出一定的工作成绩来。这是为了要实现共产主义社会。实现共产主义社会是不容易的，这是人类历史上空前伟大而艰巨的事业。这个事业必须我们党员团结全体人民作长时期不懈的斗争才能实现。这就明白了！这些个人的微小成就，就是更大一些的成就，与我们所奋斗的共产主义事业来比较，正如刘少奇同志所说，只是“沧海之一粟”，有什么可以骄傲自满呢？
    自高自大不虚心学习的人，工作上必然出漏洞，（即使有些人现在没有出漏洞，那是时间问题）。李泰然同志冒然地答复一个训练班关于学习土地改革法的问题，正是一个很好的教训。李泰然同志在受到批评后，对工作消极应付，发牢骚，要调工作，从表面上看这是“自卑”，实际是李泰然同志自高自大的另一种表现。
    应该指出：李泰然同志这种自高自大的表现，是一种小资产阶级意识的反映。一个小生产者就是这样的：靠自己的能力生活，为了保持自己的地位而积极地工作，获得一些成绩后，就向别人骄傲自大。一个共产党员是不应该有这种思想意识的，希望李泰然同志克服这种思想意识。
    但是，这里还要附带提出的，存在着像李泰然同志这种思想的同志是不少的。所以我建议，这些同志也应该在讨论李泰然同志的问题时，联系检查自己的思想，下决心改造自己，为党作更多的工作。
    最后我们应当牢记着斯大林同志说的话：“使布尔什维克光荣的，不是骄傲而是谦逊。”
  （二）向前看，追上形势的需要
    孙志伟
    李泰然同志已经忘记了一个共产党员应有的努力学习、力求上进的态度。从李泰然同志的表现来看，过去他在学习无线电时虽然很下苦功，但也只注意了对业务技术的学习，对政治学习，文化学习，依然是放松与轻视的。因而，使他自己增长了单纯技术观点，逐渐与政治疏远，不能从政治上提高自己。以致对工作、批评、学习都缺乏应有的正确的态度，助长了以功臣自居思想的发展。
    这样，李泰然同志必然把自己估计得很高，自以为已经“了不起”了。
    这样李泰然同志必然不向前看而向后看，总是想：“我过去是个好干部，能够克服困难、完成任务、获得表扬、称赞。”“我作不了这个工作，回本行吧！”而没有想到“现在”“将来”需要自己怎样努力学习，过去会的已不适合今天形势的需要，不会的急需去学习。
    因此李泰然同志不应再采取“你们看着不行的话，就调动我的工作吧”的消极态度，而应虚心学习、努力学习，向前看，追上形势的需要。只有这样李泰然同志才能作好自己的工作；否则，即使调一百回工作也还作不好工作的。
  （三）李泰然同志应该从头学起编辑同志：
    我看到关于李泰然同志不安心工作的读者来信后，很受感动。因为我的个人英雄主义的病根比李泰然同志的还深，错误也比较严重。这里想和李泰然同志交换一点意见。
    当我在入党前后，因为自己工作与学习都有些进步，非常自满。我想：“我是迫切要求进步要求改造的，现在除了有些自高自大以外，不能算是一个坏的共产党员。”谁知最近作学期学习总结时，有很多同学对我的工作作风提出了意见。例如因为我对领导的态度不好，部分同学以为我“当权”了，因而怕得罪了我入不了党入不了团。这次学习总结，使我神经紧张了一星期，夜不成眠，使我比较深刻地认识了自己的自高自大与危害党和工作的情形，并阻碍了自己的进步。真像大梦初醒，终于认识了自己，并认识了如果不克服自高自大，虽然主观上是为人民服务，事实上是不可能的，因为你被个人主义的思想所操纵了，一切工作，总是向适合于个人英雄主义方向发展。
    我想：自高自大的原因，主要是不明了“为谁工作”之故，例如我们没有想到无产阶级的事业是伟大而艰巨的，我们没有想到已有许多革命先烈为它流出了最后一滴血，我们没有想到党对自己的教育与期望就是为了实现人类最理想的共产主义社会；因而缺乏高度的革命热情，因而便沾沾自喜于小的进步，因而碰到困难就灰心丧气，没有勇气去克服它。严格说，这就是缺乏完整的共产主义人生观。
    李泰然同志很早就参加了党，对人民已有一定的贡献，这是好的。但是李泰然同志对自己的思想改造是抓得不紧的，共产主义人生观还没有很好建立与巩固，所以在革命形势发展下，就跟不上形势的发展，而落后于形势的需要，并产生了悲观的情绪。
    李泰然同志应该遵照毛主席教导我们的：虚心地从头学起，克服自己的个人英雄主义，树立起革命人生观，和学习为党工作的一切知识，为党为人民作更多的工作。
                李芳

  （四）解决个人主义思想问题
    中共北京市委党训班一部分学员
    李泰然同志是经过十几年革命锻炼的老同志，并长期在工作中表现很好，可以说是一个好党员。但是李泰然同志思想上存在着很浓厚的个人主义成分。例如他感到工作了十几年，现在连写封信也作不了主，还要受到“无组织无纪律”的批评，感到委曲；甚至垂头丧气，不安心工作，要求调到别的地方去显一显身手。
    我们认为调动工作决不能解决李泰然同志的不安心工作问题。因为按照李泰然同志过去的工作情况来看，是能够把工作作好的。所以他现在不安于工作的是思想问题，就是背上了以功臣自居的思想包袱。因此必须从这个根子上来解决他的工作问题。另一方面，革命是不断向前发展的，李泰然同志如不能努力学习，随着进步，是永远搞不好工作的。同时也不见得他仍旧能把原来的工作搞好。我们相信，把李泰然同志的思想问题解决后，他的工作问题也就解决了。
    此外，李泰然同志是有错误的；但是领导上没有从思想上来纠正他的错误，而采用传阅他所整理的材料的办法，刺激了他的情绪。从心理上、效果上来分析，采用这种办法是需要考虑的。
