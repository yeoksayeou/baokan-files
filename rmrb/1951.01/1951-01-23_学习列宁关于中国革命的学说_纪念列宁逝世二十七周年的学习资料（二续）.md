On Proletarian Leadership and the Revolutionary United Front

Lenin taught us that although colonial revolutions are bourgeois-democratic revolutions by nature, to guide this revolution onto the correct path and achieve its intended goals, the revolution must be led by the proletariat and its political party, and the leadership cannot be handed over to the bourgeois democrats. The "Supplementary Theses on National and Colonial Questions," adopted at the Second Congress of the Communist International presided over by Lenin, pointed out:

"Colonial revolutions will not be communist revolutions in the initial period; however, if they are led by the communist vanguard from the beginning, the revolutionary masses, through gradually gaining revolutionary experience, will embark on the correct path to achieve their goals. It would be completely wrong to try to solve the land problem with purely communist principles. ... But it cannot be concluded from this that the leadership of colonial revolutions should be placed in the hands of the bourgeois democrats. On the contrary, the proletarian party should intensify the propaganda of communist ideas and establish worker-peasant soviets at the earliest possible opportunity." (Ibid., p. 85)

This viewpoint of adhering to the proletarian leadership in revolutionary struggles is the most fundamental viewpoint of Bolshevism. Starting from this viewpoint, the proletariat must first consolidate its unity with the peasants, so that the proletariat can find the foundation of its strength in the democratic revolution. In his report to the Second All-Russia Congress of Communist Organizations of the Peoples of the East in 1919, Lenin used the experience of the Russian Revolution to teach the representatives of the Eastern peoples about the importance of uniting the peasants. Lenin said:

"The reason why our struggle has proceeded so easily is because the workers and peasants united against capital and feudalism. ... The Russian revolution has shown how the proletariat, having defeated capitalism, can victoriously rise up against medieval oppression by uniting with hundreds of millions of scattered peasant laboring masses." (Ibid., p. 67)

In 1920, Lenin, in his report to the Second Congress of the Communist International, again emphasized this issue, saying:

"Undoubtedly, any national movement can only be a bourgeois-democratic movement, because the main masses of the population in backward countries are peasants, and peasants are representatives of bourgeois-capitalist relations. It is inevitable to be a utopia if one thinks that the proletarian party—if it can generally arise in such a country—can implement communist tactics and communist policies in these backward countries without establishing certain relations with the peasant movement and without practically assisting the peasant movement." ("National Liberation Movement and the Strategy and Tactics of the Communist International," Ibid., p. 93)

Only by uniting the broad masses of peasants can the proletariat's leadership not fall through and have the strength to lead other revolutionary classes—especially the national bourgeoisie, who are constantly trying to compete with the proletariat for leadership. The national bourgeoisie in colonial and semi-colonial countries have a certain degree of revolutionary character in a certain historical period and to a certain extent, because they have contradictions with foreign imperialism and domestic feudal forces. As Lenin said, "It is awakening and cannot but awaken in these nations" ("On the Awakening of the Peoples of the East," Ibid., p. 69), and their nationalism is still "historically justified" (Ibid.). Therefore, the proletariat should cooperate with them on the condition that "it does not prevent us from educating and organizing the peasants and the broad masses of the exploited in a revolutionary spirit" (Ibid., p. 94), in order to overthrow the common enemy—the reactionary rule of the alliance between imperialism and feudalism. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out, "The most obvious example of this kind of cooperation is the cooperation between our Chinese Communists and Sun Yat-sen." ("On Internationalism and Nationalism")

However, the national bourgeoisie in colonial and semi-colonial countries are economically and politically weak, short-sighted, lack confidence in the masses, and have a great tendency to compromise. Lenin said:

"The bourgeoisie of oppressed nations often—perhaps even in most cases—even while supporting national movements, at the same time compromise with the bourgeoisie of the imperialist powers, that is, they come together with them against all revolutionary movements and revolutionary classes." ("National Liberation Movement and the Strategy and Tactics of the Communist International," "Lenin and Stalin on China," p. 93)

After all, democratic revolutionaries with such foresight as Sun Yat-sen were in the minority. If the proletarian party, in its cooperation with the bourgeoisie, does not be vigilant against this compromising nature of the bourgeoisie, and does not carry out timely criticism, exposure, and appropriate struggle against this compromising nature, the revolution will be in danger of being aborted due to the bourgeoisie's compromise with the enemy. The most fundamental reason for the failure of the First Great Revolution in China from 1925 to 1927 was that the leaders of the CCP at that time, the opportunist Chen Duxiu, violated Lenin's above instructions and adopted a weak and incompetent right-leaning capitulationist policy towards the bourgeoisie. This is a historical lesson. On the two interrelated issues of the Chinese proletariat's leadership and the people's revolutionary united front, Comrade Mao Zedong formulated a famous formula, which is: the revolution led by the proletariat, based on the worker-peasant alliance, of the masses of the people, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. This is a scientific formula that Comrade Mao Zedong derived by applying Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevism, summarizing the historical lessons of the Chinese revolution, and in accordance with the social characteristics of China.

On Armed Struggle

Regarding the form of struggle for the complete liberation of the Chinese people—the national liberation war—Lenin had already provided a good indication in his article "On the Junius Pamphlet" published in 1916.

In this commentary, Lenin analyzed the possibility of national liberation wars in the era of imperialism and the conditions for their victory. He pointed out that the complete liberation of the oppressed nations in colonies and semi-colonies cannot be achieved by means of peaceful compromise because imperialism is carrying out armed intervention in these countries.

The Second International believed that the liberation of colonies and semi-colonies could be achieved without revolutionary war. They put forward the so-called "super-colonization" and "peaceful liberation of colonies" "theories," believing that the dependent status of colonies could be overcome by peaceful means and economic development. Junius (the pen name of Rosa Luxemburg) believed that in the era of imperialism, there could only be imperialist wars, and there could no longer be national liberation wars. History has proved that both of these understandings are wrong.

Lenin believed that in the era of imperialism, national liberation wars are inevitable, necessary, and progressive. In this article, Lenin specifically mentioned China. Lenin said: "In the era of imperialism, national wars on the part of colonies and semi-colonies are not only possible but inevitable. In the colonies and semi-colonies (China, Turkey, Persia) live nearly one billion people, that is, more than half of the world's population. In these places, the national liberation movement is either already very strong or is growing and maturing. Any war is a continuation of politics by other means. The continuation of the national liberation policy of the colonies will inevitably be the national war of the colonies against imperialism." (Ibid., p. 48)

What is especially important is that Lenin not only pointed out the necessity, progressiveness, and inevitability of national liberation wars, but also showed us the path to victory in the war. He said: "National wars against the imperialist powers are not only possible and credible, but they are inevitable and progressive, revolutionary, although, of course, for the victory of these national wars, either the joint efforts of a large number of residents in the oppressed countries (in the examples we have given—India and China, that is, hundreds of millions of residents) are needed, or the particularly favorable coordination of conditions in the international situation (for example, the imperialist powers are exhausted, due to their wars, due to their contradictions, etc., so that they are unable to carry out intervention), or the simultaneous uprising of the proletariat of a major power against the bourgeoisie is needed (the last point we have cited is the first point from the point of view of what can be expected and favorable for the victory of the proletariat)." (Ibid., p. 51).

Later, when the Soviet Red Army bravely repelled the foreign intervention army and the White Guards and achieved victory, Lenin emphasized the victory of the Red Army war to encourage the confidence of the Eastern peoples in carrying out national revolutionary wars. He pointed out that the victory of the Red Army would explain to the peoples of all Eastern nations: "No matter how weak these nations are, no matter how invincible the power of the European oppressors (who use all the miracles of engineering and the art of war in their struggles) seems, the revolutionary war waged by the oppressed nations has such possibilities and such miracles that the liberation of the peoples of the East is now completely achievable." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Russian Edition, Vol. 24, p. 544)

The revolutionary spirit of Bolshevism of Lenin and Stalin greatly encouraged the determination and confidence of the Chinese people to defeat the powerful enemy by carrying out a victorious armed struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong led and persisted in the armed struggle of the masses of the people (mainly the peasant masses) under the leadership of the Chinese proletariat—the People's Liberation War—for more than 20 years, and finally created such a miracle—achieving the liberation of 475 million people. In military theory, he also formulated a complete set of correct military lines in China, thus enriching and developing Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevik military theory. (To be continued)

    关于无产阶级领导和革命统一战线
    列宁教导我们：殖民地革命，按其性质来说，虽然还是资产阶级民主主义的革命，但是要引导这个革命走上正确的道路，达到其预期的目的，那末这个革命就必须由无产阶级及其政党来领导，而不能把领导权交给资产阶级民主派。在列宁主持的共产国际第二次代表大会上通过的“关于民族与殖民地问题的补充提纲”中指出：
    殖民地革命在最初时期不会是共产主义革命，然而要是它从头起就由共产主义先锋队所领导，那末革命群众，由于渐次地获得革命经验，将走上达到所抱目的的正确道路。倘若力图用纯粹共产主义的原则来解决土地问题，那会是完全错误的。…………。但是不能由此得出结论说：殖民地革命的领导应当放在资产阶级民主派手中。相反地，无产阶级政党应当加紧宣传共产主义思想，并在最初的可能之下创立工农苏维埃。”（同上书八十五页）
    这个关于坚持革命斗争中无产阶级领导权的观点，是布尔什维主义的最根本的观点。从这个观点出发，无产阶级首先必须去巩固地团结农民，使无产阶级在民主革命中找到力量的基础。列宁在一九一九年在东方各民族共产主义组织第二次全俄代表大会上的报告中，就以俄国革命的经验，来教导东方各民族代表关于团结农民的问题的重要。列宁说：
    “我们的斗争之所以进行得如此容易，是因为工人和农民联合起来反对资本和封建主义，……俄国革命表明了：战胜了资本主义的无产者，与几万万散漫的农民劳动群众团结起来，如何胜利地起义反对中世纪的压迫。”（同上书六十七页）
    一九二○年，列宁在共产国际第二次代表大会上的报告中，又强调这个问题说：
    “毫无疑问，任何民族主义运动只能是资产阶级民主运动，因为落后国家人口的主要群众是农民，而农民是资产阶级资本主义关系的代表者。以为无产阶级政党——如果它在这种国家里一般地能产生的话——不与农民运动成立一定的关系，不实际上援助农民运动，就能在这些落后国家里实行共产主义策略和共产主义政策，这不免是空想。”（“民族解放运动与共产国际的战略和策略”，同上书九十三页）
    无产阶级只有团结了广大的农民，它的领导权才不致于落空，也才有力量去领导其他革命阶级——特别是时刻企图与无产阶级争夺领导权的民族资产阶级。殖民地半殖民地国家的民族资产阶级，由于他们和外国帝国主义与国内封建势力有矛盾，他们是有一定历史时期和一定程度上的革命性的。正如列宁所说“它在这些民族中正在觉醒而且也不能不觉醒”（“论东方各民族的觉醒”，同上书六十九页），他们的民族主义也还“是有着历史的理由的”（同上）。因此，无产阶级对于他们，就应当在“不阻碍我们以革命精神去教育和组织农民和广大被剥削群众”（同上书九十四页）的条件下，和他们合作，以打倒共同的敌人——帝国主义和封建主义联合的反动统治。像刘少奇同志所指出，“这种合作的最明显的例子，就是我们中国共产党人和孙中山的合作。”（“论国际主义与民族主义”）
    但是殖民地半殖民地国家的民族资产阶级，在经济上政治上都是软弱的，他们眼光短小，信任群众不足，带有很大的妥协性。列宁说：
    “被压迫国家的资产阶级往往——也许甚至在大多数场合下——即使支持民族运动，同时却与帝国主义的资产阶级妥协起来，就是说，和他们一起来反对一切的革命运动和革命阶级。”（“民族解放运动与共产国际的战略和策略”，“列宁、斯大林论中国”九十三页）
    像孙中山这样眼光较远的民主革命家，终究还是少数。无产阶级政党如果在与资产阶级合作中，不警惕资产阶级的这种妥协性，对这种妥协性不进行及时的批评、揭露与适当的斗争，革命就有因资产阶级向敌人妥协而陷于流产的危险。中国一九二五——二七年的第一次大革命的失败，最基本的原因，就是因为当时中共的领导者陈独秀机会主义者违反列宁上述的指示，对资产阶级采取了软弱无能的右倾投降主义的政策。这是历史的教训。毛泽东同志在关于中国无产阶级领导权和人民革命统一战线这两个互相关联的问题上，规定出了一个有名的公式，这就是：无产阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、人民大众的、反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命。这是毛泽东同志应用了列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义、总结了中国革命的历史教训、按照中国的社会特点而得出来的科学公式。
  关于武装斗争
    关于中国人民求得彻底解放的斗争形式——民族解放战争问题，列宁还在一九一六年发表的“论尤尼乌斯的小册子”一文中，就有了很好的昭示。
    列宁在这篇评论里，分析了帝国主义时代民族解放战争的可能性及其胜利条件，他指出：用和平妥协的方法，决不能达到殖民地半殖民地的被压迫民族的彻底解放。因为帝国主义在这些国家中实行着武装干涉。
    第二国际认为殖民地半殖民地的解放，可以不需要革命战争。他们提出所谓“超殖民地化”“和平解放殖民地”的“理论”，认为可以用和平的方法，用经济发展的方法来摆脱殖民地的依赖地位。尤尼乌斯（罗莎·卢森堡的笔名）则认为帝国主义时代只可能有帝国主义战争，再不可能有民族解放战争了。历史证明，这两种认识都是错误的。
    列宁认为，在帝国主义时代民族解放战争是不可避免的，必要的和进步的。在这篇文章里，列宁还特别提到了中国。列宁说：“在帝国主义时代，殖民地和半殖民地方面的民族战争，不仅是也许会有的，而且是不可避免的。在殖民地和半殖民地（中国、土耳其、波斯）生活着将近十万万人，即全球居民一半以上。在这些地方，民族解放运动不是已经很强大，便是在生长着和成熟着。任何战争都是政策以别种手段之继续。殖民地的民族解放政策之继续，不可避免地将是殖民地方面反对帝国主义的民族战争。”（同上书四十八页）
    尤其重要的是列宁不仅指出民族解放战争的必要性进步性和不可避免性，而且还昭示了我们取得战争胜利的途径。他说：“反对帝国主义列强的民族战争不仅是可能的和可信的，而且它们是不可避免的和进步的、革命的，虽然为了这些民族战争的胜利，当然，或者是需要被压迫各国大量居民（在我们所举的例子——印度和中国，则是数万万居民）的共同努力，或者是需要国际形势诸条件（例如帝国主义列强因其精疲力竭，因其战争，因其矛盾等等，以致无力实行干涉）的特别有利的配合，或者是需要某一大强国的无产阶级同时起义反对资产阶级（我们所举出的最后一点，从对无产阶级胜利可期望和有利的观点看来，乃是第一点）。”（同上书五十一页）。
    在后来，当苏联红军英勇地打退了外国干涉军及白卫军而取得了胜利时，列宁曾强调地以红军战争的胜利，来鼓舞东方各民族进行民族革命战争的信心。他指出，红军的胜利将会向东方各民族人民说明：“不管这些民族是怎样的羸弱，不管欧洲压迫者（他们在斗争中采用工程学的一切奇迹与军事的艺术）的力量似乎不可战胜，但是，被压迫民族所进行的革命战争，却具有这样的可能性和这样的奇迹，即东方各民族人民的解放现在是完全可以实现的了。”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十四卷，五四四页）
    列宁、斯大林这种布尔什维主义的革命精神，确是大大的鼓舞了中国人民的以进行胜利的武装斗争来打败强大的敌人的决心和信心。毛泽东同志领导与坚持了二十几年来中国的无产阶级领导下的人民大众（主要是农民大众）的武装斗争——人民解放战争，终于创造了这样的奇迹——实现了四亿七千五百万人民的解放。而在军事学说上，也制订了中国的一整套的正确的军事路线，因而丰富了和发展了列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义的军事学说。（未完）
