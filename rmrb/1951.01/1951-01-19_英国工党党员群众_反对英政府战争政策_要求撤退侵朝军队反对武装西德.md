　　British Labour Party Members
    Oppose British Government's War Policy
    Demand Withdrawal of Troops Invading Korea, and Oppose Arming West Germany
    [News Agency Report] According to Xinhua News Agency: The British Labour government's pursuit of a war policy following the United States has increasingly met with opposition from the broad masses of party members. Labour party local organizations have passed resolutions one after another, denouncing the war of aggression against Korea and the decision to rearm West Germany. The Twickenham Labour Party organization in Middlesex County passed a resolution declaring: "British troops should not participate in the international military plans of American capitalists." The Stroud and Thornbury Labour Party Local Committee in Gloucestershire and the Bromley Labour Party organization in Kent County unanimously demanded in their resolutions that the government end the Korean War and dismiss MacArthur. The resolution of the Stroud and Thornbury Labour Party Committee also demanded: unconditionally accept the People's Republic of China into the United Nations; hold a four-power conference; the British government should issue a statement indicating that it will never rearm any German soldiers.
    Faced with such strong desires of the party members, some Labour MPs have also publicly criticized the government's current policy. Samuels, a Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire, declared: "The only solution to the Korean War is to withdraw foreign troops and allow Koreans to hold free elections. The United States should leave Taiwan and abandon Chiang Kai-shek." Smith, the Labour candidate for Colchester in Essex County, expressed his opposition to the rearmament of Germany and Japan in a speech in his constituency.
    When British Secretary of War Strachey gave a speech in Dundee, Scotland, on the 14th, defending the current British policy on the Far Eastern situation, he was met with fierce opposition from the audience. When Strachey attempted to portray the great action of the Chinese People's Volunteers in aiding Korea as "aggression," his voice was immediately drowned out by huge shouts of protest: "No war against China!" "Who is handing weapons to the Nazis?" "Yankees go home!" The audience also exposed Strachey as the bloody organizer of the massacre of the people of Malaya, and they shouted at him: "You butcher!"
    When the host of the lecture falsely accused "a few people of disrupting the meeting," the audience was asked to stand up if they opposed Strachey's speech, and as a result, half of the audience stood up.

　　英国工党党员群众
    反对英政府战争政策
    要求撤退侵朝军队反对武装西德
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：英国工党政府追随美国奉行战争政策，已日益遭到广大党员群众的反对。工党各地方组织纷纷通过决议，斥责侵略朝鲜的战争和重新武装西德的决定。弥得尔塞克斯郡推肯汉姆地方工党组织通过决议，宣称：“英国军队不应参与美国资本家的国际军事计划。”格罗斯忒郡斯特劳德与索恩伯雷工党地方委员会和肯特郡布朗姆利地方工党组织在决议中一致要求政府结束朝鲜战争，并将麦克阿瑟撤职。斯特劳德与索恩伯雷工党委员会的决议并要求：无条件接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国；举行四强会议；英政府应发表声明，表示决不重新武装任何德国兵士。
    面对着党员群众这种强烈的愿望，工党若干议员也已公开批评政府现行政策。格罗斯忒的议员萨末尔斯宣称：“朝鲜战争的唯一解决办法，是撤退外国军队并让朝鲜人举行自由选举。美国应当离开台湾并抛开蒋介石。”埃赛克斯郡凯尔彻斯特工党候选人史密司在其选区的演说中，表示反对德国和日本的重新武装。
    英国陆军大臣斯特拉彻十四日在苏格兰敦提地方发表关于远东局势的演说为英国现行政策辩解时，受到听众猛烈反对。当斯特拉彻企图把中国人民志愿援朝的伟大行动说成“侵略”的时候，他的声音立即为“不准对中国作战！”“谁正在把武器交给纳粹？”“让美国佬滚回国去！”的巨大的抗议吼声所淹没。听众们还揭穿了斯特拉彻是屠杀马来亚人民的血腥组织者，他们向他高呼：“你这个刽子手！”
    当讲演会的主持人诬指“有少数人破坏集会”时，听众们就请凡是反对斯特拉彻演说的人都站起来，结果，有半数的听众都站了起来。
