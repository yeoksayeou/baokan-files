From Foreign Minister of the Central People's Government, Zhou Enlai, to the United Nations First Committee:
To Mr. Owen, Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, New York, forwarded to Mr. Ablaz, Chairman of the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly:

　　I have duly noted Mr. Owen's transmission on January 13, 1951, of the opinions on the principles concerning the Korean and other Far Eastern issues entrusted by the Chairman of the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. I now, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, make the following reply to you:

　　I. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently advocated, and still advocates, that the Korean War should be brought to a swift end through negotiations among the countries concerned, based on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the settlement of Korean internal affairs by the Korean people themselves, as a basis for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue; the United States armed forces must be withdrawn from Taiwan; and the representatives of the People's Republic of China must obtain legal status in the United Nations. I also mentioned these principles in my statement issued on December 22, 1950, and telegraphed them to Mr. Andijan, President of the United Nations General Assembly, on the same day. This is a well-known fact.

　　II. Now, the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, without the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China, adopted on January 13, 1951, various principles concerning the Korean and other Far Eastern issues, the basic point of which is still to first achieve a ceasefire in Korea and then hold negotiations among the countries concerned, and the purpose of the prior ceasefire is only to gain a respite for the American troops. Therefore, no matter how the agenda and content of the negotiations are stipulated, if the terms of the ceasefire are not negotiated and stipulated before the ceasefire, then after the ceasefire, the negotiations can be discussed indefinitely without any solution to the problem. Apart from this basic point, the other principles are also very vaguely defined, and the so-called existing international obligations are not clearly specified as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, which is extremely conducive to defending the United States' maintenance of its aggressive position in Korea, Taiwan, and other parts of the Far East. We understand very well that many countries in the United Nations agreed to the principles adopted by the First Committee on January 13, 1951, out of a desire for peace. However, it must be pointed out that the principle of ceasefire first and negotiation later only facilitates the United States in maintaining aggression and expanding aggression, and will never lead to true peace. Therefore, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China cannot agree to it.

　　III. In order for the Korean issue and important Asian issues to be truly resolved peacefully, I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, now propose to the United Nations:

　　A. Negotiations should be held among the countries concerned on the basis of agreeing to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and to let the Korean people themselves settle Korean internal affairs, in order to quickly end the Korean War;

　　B. The content of the negotiations must include the withdrawal of United States armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and issues related to the Far Eas；

　　C. The countries participating in the negotiations should include China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, India, and Egypt. The legal status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be established from the start of the seven-nation conference;

　　D. The location of the seven-nation conference should be chosen in China.

　　IV. If the above proposals are agreed upon by the United Nations and the countries concerned, we believe that holding negotiations as soon as possible will be beneficial to the rapid end of the Korean War and the peaceful settlement of Asian issues.

　　This is hereby telegraphed to you for your consideration.

### 中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来  复联合国第一委员会电

　　中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
    复联合国第一委员会电纽约联合国代理秘书长奥温先生转联合国大会第一委员会主席阿彼拉兹先生：
    奥温先生于一九五一年一月十三日转来联合国大会第一委员会主席托交的有关朝鲜及其他远东诸问题的各项原则意见，谨悉。我现在代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府向阁下作如下答复：
    一、中华人民共和国中央人民政府历来主张，现在仍然主张：朝鲜战事应该经过有关各国以一切外国军队撤出朝鲜及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决为和平调处朝鲜问题的基础的谈判，求得迅速结束；美国武装力量必须退出台湾；中华人民共和国的代表必须取得联合国的合法地位。这几项原则，我在一九五○年十二月二十二日所发表的声明中亦曾提到，并于同日电告联合国大会主席安迪让先生，此为举世周知之事。
    二、现在联合国大会第一委员会在没有中华人民共和国代表参加之下于一九五一年一月十三日通过了有关朝鲜及其他远东诸问题的各项原则，其基本点仍然是先在朝鲜停战，然后才举行有关各国的谈判，而先行停战的目的，只是为美国军队取得喘息时间。因此，不管谈判的议程和内容规定得如何，如果不先行谈判规定好停战条件然后停战，则在停战后再举行谈判，可以无休止地讨论下去，得不到任何问题的解决。除这一基本点外，其他各项原则亦规定得极不明确，而所谓现存国际义务又未明白指出为开罗宣言及波茨坦公告，这就极利于为美国维持其在朝鲜、台湾和远东各地的侵略地位作辩护。我们很理解联合国中不少国家同意第一委员会在一九五一年一月十三日所通过的各项原则是出于和平愿望。但必须指出：先停战后谈判的原则，只便利于美国维持侵略和扩张侵略，决不能导致真正的和平，因之中华人民共和国中央人民政府不能予以同意。
    三、为着朝鲜问题和亚洲重要问题真能够得到和平解决，我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府现向联合国提议：
    甲、在同意从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决的基础上举行有关各国的谈判，以迅速结束朝鲜战争；
    乙、谈判内容，必须包括美国武装力量从台湾及台湾海峡撤退和远东有关问题；
    丙、举行谈判的国家，应包括中华人民共和国、苏联、英国、美国、法国、印度和埃及七国，中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位即从举行七国会议起予以确定；
    丁、七国会议的地点，应选在中国。
    四、上述提议，如获得联合国及有关国家同意，我们认为及早举行谈判，对于迅速结束朝鲜战争及和平解决亚洲问题是有益的。
    谨此电达，即希查照。
                  中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
                                    一九五一年一月十七日于北京
