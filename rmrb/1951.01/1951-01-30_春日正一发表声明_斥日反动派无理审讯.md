Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: Kazuo Kasuga, member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, who was illegally "purged" by the American and Japanese reactionaries and arrested on October 7th, has been unreasonably interrogated by the Tokyo District Court more than 20 times since late October. Although the fabricated charges of the reactionary inspection authorities were completely overturned during the interrogation, they unreasonably demanded a five-year prison sentence for Kazuo Kasuga in the 23rd interrogation on January 19th.

According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo citing TASS: After the interrogation on January 19th, Kazuo Kasuga issued the following statement: "The lack of basis for the arguments and the empty fabrication of the indictment in this interrogation reminds one of the 'March 15, 1928 Indictment Case' " (Note: During the 1928 Japanese general election, the Labor-Farmer Party, under the influence of the Japanese Communist Party, participated in the election and won more than 200,000 votes. The Japanese reactionaries were greatly shocked and conducted a large-scale investigation of Japanese revolutionary people on March 15th. Thousands of JCP members were arrested by the police.) History proves that the indictment case was a step taken by Japanese imperialism to prepare for a war of aggression and to persecute the people. Many people have expressed sympathy and approval to me, which convinces me that the people of our country fully understand the true nature of this case. I will fight for justice, peace, and national independence."

　　春日正一发表声明
　  斥日反动派无理审讯
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京讯：遭美、日反动派非法“整肃”并于十月七日被捕的日本共产党中央委员会委员春日正一，自十月下旬以来，曾被东京地方法院无理审讯二十余次。尽管反动的检查当局的捏造罪状在审讯过程中完全被推翻，但它竟在一月十九日的第二十三次审讯中无理要求判处春日正一徒刑五年。
    据塔斯社东京引联合通讯社消息：在一月十九日的审讯后，春日正一发表下列声明：“在这次审讯中，论证的毫无根据和起诉书的空洞虚构，使人想起“一九二八年三月十五日的检举案”（按：一九二八年日本大选时，在日本共产党影响下的劳动农民党参加竞选，获得二十多万票，日本反动派大为震惊，就在三月十五日对日本革命人民大肆检举，被警察逮捕的日共党员达数千名之多。）历史证明，那次检举案是日本帝国主义准备侵略战争和对人民施行迫害的一个步骤。许多人向我表示同情和赞许，使我确信我国人民充分了解这一案件的真正性质。我将为正义、和平以及国家独立而斗争。”
