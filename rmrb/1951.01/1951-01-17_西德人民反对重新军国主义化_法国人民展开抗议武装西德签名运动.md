　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: U.S. imperialism is intensifying its activities to assemble an aggressive army in West Germany. Following the meeting between U.S. High Commissioner for Germany McCloy and West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer on January 2nd, McCloy, along with U.S. Secretary of the Army Pace, began secret talks with West German military experts in Petersberg on January 9th. According to a report by Naumov, a Pravda correspondent in Berlin, all decisions regarding the rearmament of West Germany have been made in secret. The West German military experts attending the meeting were Speidel, former chief of staff to Field Marshal Rommel of the Hitlerite Wehrmacht, and Heusinger, former chief of the operations section of the Hitlerite General Staff. At the meeting, they received concrete opinions from the U.S. side regarding the recruitment, training, and organization of the new army and listened to the U.S. side's suggestions for establishing German forces including infantry, artillery, tanks, field engineers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft units, and air force detachments.
    While these U.S. and German warmongers are conducting these criminal negotiations, the movement of the West German people against remilitarization is developing extensively. The Bonn "government" is receiving telegrams almost every hour from all strata of the West German people, especially from the industrial states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg, Hesse, Bavaria, and Württemberg, protesting the establishment of a West German army. Even Bonn "Vice-Chancellor" Blücher had to admit that 99 percent of the West German people oppose remilitarization. In West Germany, signatures against the revival of militarism have been collected in hundreds of enterprises. "Committees Against Remilitarization" have also been established one after another. The Osnabrück Women's Congress urged Adenauer to accept Grotewohl's proposal, and they declared: We do not want our children to freeze to death because German coal is used in the munitions industry, we do not want increased taxes and prices, and we do not want West Germany to be remilitarized and another war to occur.
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: TASS, Paris, 14th: The campaign to collect signatures for protests against the rearmament of West Germany is proceeding smoothly in France. *Ce Soir* reported: In the small town of Salindres-Gange alone, 1,101 people signed the protest. In the port of Nice, 375 people signed the protest in just one morning. In Courrières, 850 miners and 2,500 steelworkers signed.

　　西德人民反对重新军国主义化
    法国人民展开抗议武装西德签名运动
    【新华社十六日讯】美帝国主义正在西德加紧拼凑侵略军的活动。紧接美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃一月二日与西德傀儡总理阿登纳会谈之后，一月九日，麦克洛埃又与美国陆军部长佩斯一起，开始在彼得斯堡与西德军事专家们举行秘密谈判。据真理报驻柏林记者瑙莫夫报道：一切关于重新武装西德的决定，都已在秘密中作出。出席会议的西德军事专家为前希特勒国防军元帅罗麦尔的参谋长斯派达尔和前希特勒参谋总部作战处处长豪辛格。他们在会议上获得了美国方面对于新军队的招募、训练和编制方面的确实意见，并听取了美国方面关于建立包括步兵、炮兵、坦克、野战工兵、反坦克和防空部队以及空军分队在内的德国军队的建议。
    在美德战争贩子们举行这种罪恶的谈判时，西德人民反对重新军国主义化的运动正在广泛发展。波恩“政府”几乎每小时都接到来自西德各阶层人民，特别是来自北莱因——威斯特伐利亚、汉堡、黑森、巴伐利亚和瓦登堡等工业州抗议建立西德军队的电报。就连波恩“副总理”布吕契也不得不承认：西德人民百分之九十九都反对重新军国主义化。在西德，成百的企业中已征集了反对军国主义复活的签名。“反对重新军国主义化委员会”也纷纷成立。奥斯那布律克妇女大会敦促阿登纳接受格罗提渥建议，她们并声言：我们不愿因为德国的煤用在军需工业上而使我们的孩子们冻死，我们不愿捐税和物价增高，我们不愿西德重新军事化和发生另一次战争。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎十四日电：为反对重新武装西德的抗议书征集签名的运动正在法国顺利进行中。《今晚报》报道：在萨林德吉朗这座小城内就有一千一百零一个人在抗议书上签了名。有一天尼斯港仅在一个上午就有三百七十五个人在抗议书上签了名。古里耶有八百五十名矿工和二千五百名炼钢工人签了名。
