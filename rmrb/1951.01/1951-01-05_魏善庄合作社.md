　　Weishanzhuang Cooperative
　　Fan Chaonan, Wei Yizheng, Cui Naifu
　　Editor's Note: The experience of the Weishanzhuang Reorganization Cooperative proves a very important truth: that if the higher-level cooperative cannot provide timely support to the lower-level cooperative in terms of business, even a cooperative that has been reorganized cannot consolidate its achievements.
　　(1)
　　Weishanzhuang in Daxing County, Hebei Province, is a station on the Beijing-Tianjin railway line. After liberation, a cooperative was established, with members contributing a total of 101 shares, each share worth 45 catties of corn. However, due to being preoccupied with market activities in business operations and extravagant spending within the cooperative, it collapsed not long after its establishment. This March, the county federation sent cadres to help settle accounts and organized a joint village cooperative, but the business policy was unclear and failed to meet the needs of the members. The quality of goods within the cooperative was poor and prices were high. Members thought it was a public business and that joining the cooperative would allow them to borrow grain, exchange for finer goods, and sell hides for saltpeter, taking advantage of public resources. Cadres within the cooperative had a "get by" mentality and bureaucratic work style, so the masses of members were unwilling to deal with the cooperative, and women were afraid to enter. The retail business, on market days, sold no more than 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. On ordinary days, daily sales were only around 50,000 yuan.
　　Since the National Conference of Cooperative Workers' Representatives, the Daxing County Federation of Cooperatives, based on the principles determined by the conference, focused on this cooperative for rectification. Through strengthening cadre education, conducting propaganda, and improving business operations, it created experience in reorganization, overcame the cadres' perfunctory attitude and pursuit of profits, and tried to solve the needs of members in production and life. After preliminary rectification, the cooperative showed a vigorous new atmosphere.
　　The reason why the rectification of this cooperative achieved such great results is mainly because it grasped the opinions reflected by the masses of members during the rectification, first improved the business, strived to meet the urgent needs of the members, and made a significant difference between the cooperative price and the market price for the main goods. For example, when members reflected that it was unfair that the cooperative used a larger "dou" (measuring container) when receiving coarse grain for exchange and a smaller "dou" when dispensing fine grain, the "dou" was immediately replaced, and it was broadcast on the market to inform members that a new "dou" had been replaced. Members reflected that they needed realgar for planting wheat, so 3,150 catties were immediately purchased and sold at 8,000 yuan per catty lower than the market price, and the quality was higher than the realgar trafficked by private merchants. In addition, the cooperative supplied members with edible salt during the pickling season, and according to local custom, supplied members with the colored homespun cloth they liked, etc., all at prices lower than the market price. Members reflected that the cooperative was like a government office, with the cadres putting on airs. The cadres also made self-criticisms and changed their previous work style. When members entered, they were greeted, and when they left, they were seen off, and problems were patiently explained, making members feel amiable and approachable. As a result, any member who came to the cooperative to buy goods, upon leaving the cooperative, would tell people that the cooperative had changed. Therefore, the cooperative quickly became active, and the turnover increased significantly. Before the start of the rectification, the turnover of one market day (August 16th) was 330,000 yuan, which increased to 520,000 yuan on September 27th, and increased to 840,000 yuan on October 3rd. The member representatives also changed their previous indifferent attitude towards the cooperative. Every market day, they would come to the cooperative to ask questions and help when they saw the cadres were too busy. This situation was very different from before.
　　After such a transformation in business and cadre work style, the relationship between members and the cooperative was greatly strengthened. The cooperative cadres went to various villages to carry out propaganda and education to the masses of members, recruit new members, organize members into groups according to their willingness, elect representatives, deliberate on candidates for the board of directors and supervisors of the cooperative, and widely solicit members' opinions. On October 20th, a meeting of member representatives was held, attended by 30 representatives. In addition to passing the articles of association and electing the board of directors and supervisors, the spirit of the draft Cooperative Law was used to convey to members the need to improve their understanding of the cooperative. As a result, on the first market day after the meeting, the turnover suddenly increased to 1,320,000 yuan, and reached 1,700,000 yuan on the second market day.

　　Everything that the Weishanzhuang Cooperative presented after preliminary rectification was a good start to its development. However, recently, different new changes have occurred, namely that members are dissatisfied, and cadres' morale is low, because the needs of the members cannot be met, and even the member representatives and the board of supervisors and directors dare not be convened. The turnover dropped from 1,700,000 yuan on the second market day after the preliminary rectification to 640,000 yuan on the market day of December 9th, and the loss up to the end of November reached more than 750,000 yuan. The main reasons for this lively upward trend to decline again are:
　　(1) The county cooperative's business policy of serving the lower-level cooperatives has not yet been consistently implemented in actual business. For the purpose of production and disaster relief, the county cooperative collected saltpeter in Huangcun, collecting from both members and non-members, with no limit on quality, collecting more than 1.3 million catties, without developing a single new member. Moreover, when there was a shortage of funds for collecting saltpeter on November 10th, the 3,000 catties of corn that the Weishanzhuang cooperative supplied to members were also transferred to collect saltpeter. It was not replenished in time, so when members needed grain, the cooperative could not supply it.
　　(2) The county cooperative did not have a sufficient understanding of the urgency of expanding business after the rectification of the cooperative. The turnover of the cooperative increased from 330,000 yuan on one market day before the rectification to 1,700,000 yuan on the second market day, which already illustrates the rapid expansion of business. Because the county cooperative did not have a sufficient understanding of this, its actions to support the cooperative in business did not keep up in a timely manner.
　　(3) The county cooperative did not grasp the seasonal needs of the cooperative's business and provide timely support. More than ten villages of members of the cooperative rely on boiling saltpeter for a living. Because it was far to go to Huangcun, they requested to collect saltpeter in Weishanzhuang. The county cooperative agreed, but did not go for a long time. By the time they went to collect on December 9th, they had missed the season for large-scale saltpeter production. In the second half of November, it was the time when members needed coal most urgently. The county cooperative did not promptly support it according to the requirements of the cooperative, resulting in the interruption of coal supply.
　　(4) In the leadership of the reorganization, the county cooperative did not pay attention to consolidating and developing the existing achievements. When the preliminary reorganization work of the cooperative came to an end, the three cadres sent to assist in the reorganization were completely recalled, and no one has been sent to help since then. At the same time, due to insufficient experience and ability, the cooperative did not take advantage of the favorable opportunity to develop new members. Except for a small number of members developed before the representatives' meeting, not a single new member has been added after the meeting. The share capital should be 13,490 catties of rice, but as of now, the actual paid-up share capital is only 5,140 catties of rice. Therefore, due to the lack of funds, it is impossible to fully meet the needs of the members in business.
　　The experience of the Weishanzhuang Cooperative tells us that in order for higher-level cooperatives to serve lower-level cooperatives, they must mainly provide timely and concrete support to lower-level cooperatives in terms of business; otherwise, even well-reorganized grassroots cooperatives cannot be consolidated.

　　魏善庄合作社
    范超南·魏一正·崔乃福
    编者按：魏善庄整理合作社的经验证明了一个很重要的真理，即是如果上级合作社不能在业务上给下级合作社及时的支持，就是已经整理好了的合作社，仍然是不能巩固它的成果的。
            （一）
    河北省大兴县魏善庄是京津铁路线上的一个车站。解放后建立了合作社，社员共入股一○一股，每股四十五斤玉米。但由于在业务经营上忙于市场活动，社内开支铺张浪费，建社不久就垮了台。今年三月，县联社派干部帮助结清账目，组织了联村社，但业务方针不明确，未能满足社员需要，社内货物质量既差，价格又贵，社员以为是公家的买卖，入了社能贷粮，换细、卖皮硝等，占公家的便宜。社内干部存在着“得过且过”的思想，和机关化的作风，所以社员群众不愿与合作社打交道，妇女们不敢进门。门市业务，在集日不过销售三四十万元平。时每日只能销售五万元左右。
    自从全国合作社工作者代表会议以后，大兴县联社根据会议决定的方针，以该社为重点，进行整顿，从加强干部教育，进行宣传和改进业务经营中，创造了整社经验，克服了社干们的敷衍塞责，追求利润的思想，尽力解决社员在生产和生活上的需要。经过初步整顿后，该社呈现了一种生气勃勃的新气象。
    这个社的整顿所以能获得如此大的成绩，主要是因为在整顿中抓住了社员群众所反映的意见，首先改进业务，力求满足社员的迫切需要，在主要货品上使社价与市价有显著的差额。如社员反映合作社以粗换细时收的斗大出的斗小不公平，就马上换了斗，且在集上广播，使社员了解换了新斗。社员反映目前种麦需要信石，即时买来三一五○斤，出卖时每斤低于市价八○○○元，且较私商贩运的信石质量高。此外在腌菜季节供给社员食盐，按当地习惯供给社员喜欢的带色土布等，价格均比市价为低。社员反映合作社和衙门一样，干部派头很大，干部们也作了检讨，改变了以前的作风，社员进门话接出门话送，耐心解释问题，使社员感觉到和蔼可亲，这样一来，凡来社买货的社员，出了合作社门口，见人就说合作社变了样，因此合作社很快的活跃起来，营业额随着有了显著的增加。开始整顿前一集（八月十六日）的营业额是三十三万元，到九月二十七日增至五十二万元，十月三日增加到八十四万元，社员代表们也转变了以前对合作社漠不关心的态度，每逢集日，就到合作社来问长问短，见干部忙不过来，就插手帮忙，这种情况和以前是大不相同了。
    在业务和干部作风上，经过这样的转变后，大大的密切了社员和合作社的关系，合作社干部又分头深入各村，对社员群众进行宣传教育，吸收新社员，根据社员自愿编成小组，选举代表，酝酿合作社理监事的候选人，并广泛搜集社员意见。十月二十日召开社员代表大会，出席代表三十人，除通过社章，选举理监事外，并根据合作社法草案的精神对社员传达提高社员对合作社的认识，因此在会后的第一个集，营业额突增至一三二万元，至第二集即达一七○万元。
            （二）
    魏善庄合作社在初步整顿后，所呈现的一切情况，都是它发展上一个很好的开端。可是最近则发生了不同的新变化，就是社员纷纷不满，干部情绪低落，因为不能满足社员的需要，甚至连社员代表和理监事会也不敢召开了。营业额由初步整顿后第二个集的一七○万元，降到十二月九日集的六四万元，而且结算至十一月底亏损达七十五万余元，这种由活生生的上升气象再度消沉下来，其主要原因是：
    （一）县社对为下级社服务的业务方针，还没有在实际业务上，坚持地贯彻下去。县社为了生产救灾，在黄村收硝，社员与非社员齐收，质量不限，收了一百三十余万斤，未发展一个新社员，而且在十一月十日收硝资金不足时，把魏善庄社供给社员需要的三千斤玉米也调去收硝。又未能及时补还以致社员需粮时，该社无法供给。
    （二）县社对该社整顿后业务扩大的急迫性认识不够。该社由整顿前一集营业额三十三万元，扩大到第二集营业额一七○万元，已经说明了业务扩大的急速。因为县社对此认识不足，所以在业务方面来支持该社的行动，也就没有及时的跟上去。
    （三）县社对该社的业务，没有抓住其季节性的需要，及时予以支持，该社有十余村的社员，依靠熬硝度日，因去黄村路远，要求到魏善庄收，县社答应了，但很久没去，及至十二月九日去收时，已错过大量出硝的季节。在十一月后半月，正是社员需煤最迫切的时候，县社未按该社的要求及时设法支持，致使煤的供给中断。
    （四）县社在整社的领导上，没有注意到巩固和向前发展已有成绩。当该社初步整顿工作告一段落后，即把派去协助整顿的三个干部完全调回，迄未再派专人前往帮助。同时该社由于经验和能力不够，没有利用有利时机发展新社员，除在代表会前发展了少数社员外，在会后未增加一个新社员，股金应为一三、四九○斤米，但截止到现在实际缴纳的股金仅五、一四○斤米。因此，资金缺乏，业务上就不可能充分满足社员的需要。
    魏善庄合作社的经验告诉我们：上级社为下级社服务，必须主要的在业务上给下级社以及时的具体的支持，否则即使整顿好了的基层社仍然不能巩固的。
