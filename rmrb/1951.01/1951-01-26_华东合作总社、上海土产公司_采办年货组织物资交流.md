　　The Huadong Cooperative General Office is vigorously organizing the exchange of native and special products in order to fully supply its members with New Year goods. Zhejiang Province has supplied Jinan and northern Jiangsu with 210,000 jin of brown sugar, and supplied Nanjing, Wuxi, Beijing, Tianjin and other cities with 170,000 cases of mandarin oranges. Shandong Province has shipped 280,000 jin of small dates and a large number of vermicelli to other parts of East China. Shanghai accounted for a large proportion of this New Year goods allocation. Currently, shipments to Shanghai include: more than 10,000 jin of Jinhua ham from Zhejiang, 250,000 cases of Huangyan mandarin oranges; 220,000 jin of Huangqiao cured meats from northern Jiangsu, more than 900 pigs from Huaiyin, and 240,000 preserved eggs; more than 4,000 fat pigs from Shandong. In addition, a large number of New Year goods such as dried shrimp, dried bamboo shoots, meat floss, daylily, red dates, and walnuts have also been shipped. The total value of the above New Year goods supplied to the Shanghai market is 18 billion yuan. The Shanghai Municipal Cooperative General Office has now issued a New Year goods survey form to all members to ensure that all kinds of New Year goods are fully supplied at low prices according to the needs of members.
    This newspaper reports: As the Spring Festival approaches, the Shanghai Native Produce Company, under the principle of ensuring market supply and stabilizing prices, has successively transferred a large number of local products from Shandong, northern Anhui, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Henan, Jiangxi, northern Jiangsu, Fujian and other places to Shanghai, such as vermicelli, dates, persimmon cakes, peach kernels, melon seeds, dried bamboo shoots, pork and various fruits. In view of the fact that the price of pork in the vegetable market is bound to rise every holiday, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce has specially cooperated with the Pig Industry Marketing Department of the East China District Native Produce Company, pork commercial units, etc., to organize a price negotiation mechanism, so that the price of pork will not fluctuate during the New Year.
