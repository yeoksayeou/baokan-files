Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 21st: The Romanian Workers' Party's official newspaper, *Spark*, published an article on the 19th entitled "Striving for Peace in the Far East," commenting on Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement to the First Committee of the United Nations on January 17th: "This statement plays a new and important role in establishing peace in the Far East and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. It powerfully exposes the illegal decision of the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly regarding the so-called principles statement on the Korean issue and other issues in the Far East."

The commentary, after describing the solemn attitude of Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and the proposals in the statement for resolving the Korean and Asian issues, pointed out: "The People's Republic of China has exposed the despicable conspiracy of American imperialism and is acting to save the interests of peace in Asia. China has made a series of concrete proposals based on the democratic and reasonable principles supported by China and the Soviet Union for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other Asian issues. These proposals are not only the demands of the People's Republic of China, but also the demands of hundreds of millions of peace fighters, because they are related to the interests of world peace. However, these demands do not suit the tastes of the United States. Fearing the powerful voice of the People's Republic of China resounding through the United Nations, Acheson has frantically declared that he cannot accept China's proposals. The attitudes towards China's proposals within the imperialist aggressor camp are different; the contradictions revealed by this are very obvious. Radio Paris broadcast that these proposals have caused unanimous panic among the Western bloc."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 22nd: London dispatch: The British Communist Party's official newspaper, *The Daily Worker*, published an editorial on the 20th commenting on Foreign Minister Zhou's reply to the United Nations' proposals, stating: "People's China has put forward a reasonable reply to the United Nations' ceasefire proposals. The suggestions put forward in this reply form the basis for seeking an honorable and democratic resolution and achieving peace through negotiation." The editorial pointed out: Truman is clamoring that the United States will "exert all possible pressure" on all other countries to get the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to accuse China of being an "aggressor," with the aim of "intimidating every country to make such a decision, thereby paving the way for sanctions." "However, despite such intimidation, Washington has so far only been able to mobilize a motley crew, such as Greece, Turkey, Peru, and Chiang Kai-shek, to support its plan."

The editorial continued: "No previous American proposal has been met with such cold reception from the whole world. Never before has the United States been so isolated on this critical issue from the vast majority of people in the world."

The editorial criticized the British government's attitude as "cowardly evasion" and warned: "The British government is playing with fire by hesitating on this vital issue. Every hour wasted in evading this issue will only provoke more intimidation and pressure from the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 22nd: Vienna dispatch: The Austrian Communist Party's official newspaper, *Volksstimme* ("People's Voice"), published an editorial on the 20th commenting on Foreign Minister Zhou's reply telegram to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, stating: "The demands of the Chinese People's Government are still exactly the same now as in the past, even at a time when the United States is suffering even worse military defeats. Now, as always, China is only demanding the protection of its own rights and the rights of the Korean people, which everyone except the warmongers considers legitimate. The fact that the Chinese People's Government has not used America's military debacle to put forward any new conditions proves the sincerity of the Chinese People's Government's desire for peace."

　　罗工人党与英、奥共产党报纸一致支持周外长复联合国电
    【本报讯】据新华社布拉格二十一日电：罗马尼亚工人党机关报火花报十九日发表题为“争取远东和平”的论文，评论周恩来外长十七日致联合国第一委员会的声明称：“这个声明在建立远东和平及和平解决朝鲜问题上起着新的、重要的作用，它强有力地揭发了联合国大会第一委员会所谓关于朝鲜问题及远东其他问题的原则声明的非法决定。”
    评论在叙述了周外长声明的庄严态度及声明中解决朝鲜及亚洲问题的提议后，指出：“中华人民共和国已揭露了美帝国主义的卑劣阴谋，并为拯救亚洲的和平利益而行动着。中国已根据中苏两国所支持的对和平解决朝鲜问题及亚洲其他问题的民主及合理的原则，做出了一系列的具体的建议。这些提议不仅是中华人民共和国的要求，而且是亿万和平战士的要求，因为这是与整个世界和平利益有关的。但这些要求并不合乎美国口味。由于惧怕中华人民共和国强有力的声音响彻联合国，艾奇逊已慌张地宣称不能接受中国的建议。帝国主义侵略阵营内部对于中国建议的态度各不相同；由此表现出来的矛盾是非常明显的。巴黎电台广播说：这些建议已引起西方集团一致的恐慌。”
    【本报讯】据新华社布拉格二十二日电：伦敦讯：英国共产党机关报工人日报二十日发表社论，评论我国周外长对联合国建议的答复称：“人民中国已对联合国的停火建议提出合理的答复。这个答复提出的若干建议，形成以谈判方式求得荣誉的和民主的解决和获致和平的基础。”社论指出：杜鲁门正在叫嚣美国将对所有其他国家“施加一切可能的压力”，以使联合国大会政治委员会指责中国为“侵略者”，其目的，在于“对每一个国家进行吓诈，使它们作出这种决定，从而给制裁开辟道路。”“但是，尽管进行这样的吓诈，华盛顿迄今只能动员一些乌合之众，如希腊、土耳其、秘鲁和蒋介石之流，来支持它的计划。”
    社论继称：“以前美国的任何提案，从没有受到全世界这样的冷遇。美国以前在世界绝大多数人民中，从没有像现在这样在这个危急的问题上这样的孤立。”
    社论指责英国政府的态度是“懦弱的规避”，并警告说：“英国政府在这个生命攸关的问题上犹豫不前，实在是在玩火。闪避这个问题所浪费的每一小时，只会惹起美国的更多的吓诈和压力。”
    【本报讯】据新华社布拉格二十二日电：维也纳讯：奥地利共产党机关报“人民之声”二十日发表社论，评论我国周外长致联合国大会政治委员会的复电称：“中国人民政府的要求，就是在现在美国遭受到更恶劣的军事失败的时候，仍然和过去完全一样。现在，一如往昔，中国只是要求维护它自己的和朝鲜人民的权利，而对于这些权利，除战争贩子以外，所有人都认为是正当的。中国人民政府并没有利用美国的军事惨败而提出任何新的条件，这证明中国人民政府要求和平的真心诚意。”
