　　Xinhua News Agency, January 13th:
The Vietnamese National United Front (referred to as Viet Lien) sent a letter to our government and people, congratulating the 1951 New Year. The letter reads: To the Government and People of the People's Republic of China:

　　On the occasion of the New Year of 1951, the Vietnamese National United Front and the entire Vietnamese people extend our respects to the unity and victory of the Chinese Government and People. In 1950, the Chinese army and people completely defeated the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime and the American imperialists. We believe that in 1951, China will achieve even greater victories in building people's democracy and will become a bulwark for the Asian people's struggle for national independence. With the help of the Chinese people and the people of the world, the Vietnamese people are determined to crush the French colonialists and American interventionists, as a contribution to defending world peace and democracy.

　　Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: The Vietnam Peace Congress sent a letter to Chairman Mao on November 19th of last year to pay tribute and express that the Vietnamese people guarantee to be closely united with our people and other people of the world in the struggle to defend world peace and democracy. The letter reads: Chairman Mao Zedong:

　　The Vietnam Congress for the Defense of Peace, meeting on November 19th, respectfully salutes you and wishes you good health.

　　We firmly believe that the People's Republic of China, under your long-tested leadership, is playing a significant role in the liberation movement of the Asian people and the consolidation of world peace.

　　We warmly hail the active support given by the Chinese people to the Korean people in their struggle against imperialist aggression.

　　All Vietnamese people guarantee to be closely united with the Chinese people – the elder brother of Asia – and other peoples of the world in our struggle to defend world peace and democracy.
