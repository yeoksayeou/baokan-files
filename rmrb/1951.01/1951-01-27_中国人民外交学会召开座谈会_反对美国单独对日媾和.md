Xinhua News Agency, January 26th:

The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs held a symposium on the evening of the 25th, titled "Opposing the US Conspiracy for a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan." Attendees included Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Wentian, Zhou Gengsheng, Shao Lizi, Luo Longji, Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Hanfu, Fan Changjiang, Qian Duansheng, Zhang Jiongbo, Qiao Guanhua, Mei Gongbin, Lian Guan, Fan Hong, Mei Ru'ao, Liu Zerong, Ji Chaoding, Zeng Bingjun, Liu Wang Liming, Ke Bonian, Huan Xiang, Yang Gang, Dong Yueqian, Chen Jiakang, Chen Tiqiang, Ye Jingshen, Wu Maosun, Zhou Jingwen, Meng Xianzhang, and more than 120 others.

The meeting was presided over by Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. In his speech, he said: After suffering a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism is stepping up its efforts to instigate a separate peace treaty with Japan, attempting to further arm Japan in the Far East, just as it armed West Germany in Western Europe. The recent visit to Japan by US State Department advisor Dulles, under orders, is a concrete manifestation of this American conspiracy. Zhang Xiruo pointed out that this American conspiracy is a direct threat to peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, the Chinese people should unite with the people of all countries in the world to launch a movement against the US's separate peace treaty with Japan and the arming of Japan, and to smash the US's conspiracy.

Mei Ru'ao, head of the Japanese Peace Treaty Group of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, then spoke. He pointed out that the United States had already instigated a separate peace treaty with Japan as early as July 1947. On September 14th of last year, the Truman government again instructed the US State Department to carry out activities for a separate peace treaty with Japan. The Truman government vainly believes that after savagely suppressing progressive forces in Japan, it can pressure its vassal states to follow the United States in concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan, and is preparing to unilaterally declare an end to the state of war with Japan if the separate peace treaty is strongly opposed. Mei Ru'ao emphasized that the US's conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and to arm Japan is a complete violation of international agreements and is illegal. This illegal action by the United States, which threatens China's security and peace in the Far East, will inevitably arouse the resolute opposition of the people of the world, especially the people of Asian countries who have suffered from the aggression of Japanese militarism.

Zhuang Tao, an expert on Japanese issues, explained from the perspective of the Japanese economy that Japan is being dragged onto the path of a war system by the United States. Zhuang Tao pointed out that Japan's annual steel production last year is estimated to have reached three million tons, exceeding the total steel production from 1946 to 1948 and approaching Japan's wartime (1938) annual steel production. The same is true of Japan's oil refining industry. The war-oriented nature of the Japanese economy will first and foremost harm the Japanese people. As a result of the US occupiers' rush to purchase military supplies to launch the war of aggression against Korea, inflation in Japan has begun again, with prices rising by 15 percent from June to September last year, while workers' wages are declining relatively sharply. In addition, as a result of the US ban on Japanese exports to China at the end of last year, Japanese industry has suffered a loss of 15 billion yen (approximately US$47 million). This situation has created serious difficulties and bankruptcies for many small and medium-sized capitalists in Japan. The US's arming of Japan will stifle Japan's peaceful economy and lead Japan onto the path of destruction. The broad masses of the Japanese people will inevitably rise up and resolutely oppose the US's conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and to arm Japan.

Zheng Senyu, an expert on Japanese issues, pointed out that the central purpose of the US's separate peace treaty with Japan is to further arm Japan. In fact, the United States is already using Japanese manpower and material resources to carry out wars of aggression. This situation is intolerable to the Chinese people and is also opposed by the Japanese people. After the failure of the US war of aggression against Korea, the Japanese people have become even more clear that Japan's pursuit of aggression following the United States will only lead to destruction in the face of the strong anti-aggression forces of the Asian people. Therefore, the movement of the Japanese people against rearmament has developed even more extensively.

Qiao Guanhua, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, pointed out: We should expand the victory of the Chinese and Korean people on the Korean battlefield and thoroughly defeat the US imperialists' conspiracy to arm Japan in the East. We should coordinate with the widespread movement launched by the European people against the US imperialists' arming of West Germany, strengthen the forces for safeguarding world peace, and fundamentally prevent the imperialists' conspiracy to provoke new wars from being realized.

Zhou Gengsheng, an expert on international law, pointed out: The fact that US imperialism is now suddenly intensifying its conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and to arm Japan is because it feels that it is difficult to maintain the status quo in Japan, and after suffering a disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, US imperialism believes that if it is to carry out wars of aggression against Asia in the future, it must use the Japanese people as cannon fodder. However, the hundreds of millions of people in Asian countries who have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression will inevitably rise up and resolutely oppose this American conspiracy.

Shao Lizi, a director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, pointed out: The conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan should lead to peace, but the purpose of the US's separate peace treaty with Japan is to lead to war. The people of the world who love peace should unite to oppose the US's conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and to rearm Japan.

Luo Longji, a director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, believes that in the movement against the US's separate peace treaty with Japan and against the arming of Japan, we should continue to deepen and strengthen the patriotic ideological education of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend Our Country." He advocated that all democratic parties, organizations, and people from all walks of life across the country should participate in this movement and unite with the Japanese people to strive for the success of this movement.

Zhang Wentian, Fan Hong, Zeng Bingjun, and others also spoke at the meeting. They all denounced the US conspiracy to rearm Japan and expressed the hope that the people of the Far East countries would unite to thwart the American conspiracy.

The meeting was concluded by Zhang Xiruo. He pointed out that the Chinese people should launch a movement against the US's separate peace treaty with Japan and the arming of Japan, and demand the rapid conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan to end the US's dictatorial rule in Japan. In concluding his speech, he said: The Chinese people and the people of the world (including the Japanese people) have the full strength to smash the aggressive plans of US imperialism. The American aggressors will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

　　中国人民外交学会召开座谈会
    反对美国单独对日媾和
    【新华社二十六日讯】中国人民外交学会二十五日晚召开“反对美国单独对日媾和阴谋座谈会”，出席者有张奚若、张闻天、周鲠生、邵力子、罗隆基、廖承志、章汉夫、范长江、钱端升、张絅伯、乔冠华、梅龚彬、连贯、樊弘、梅汝璈、刘泽荣、冀朝鼎、曾炳钧、刘王立明、柯柏年、宦乡、杨刚、董越千、陈家康、陈体强、叶景莘、吴茂荪、周鲸文、孟宪章等一百二十余人。
    会议由中国人民外交学会会长张奚若主持。他在致词中说：美帝国主义在侵朝战争中遭到惨败以后，正在加紧策动单独对日媾和，企图象在西欧武装西德那样，在远东进一步武装日本。最近美国国务院顾问杜勒斯的奉命赴日，就是美国这一阴谋的具体表现。张奚若指出，美国这一阴谋，是对远东与世界和平的直接威胁。因此，中国人民应联合世界各国人民，展开反对美国单独对日媾和与武装日本的运动，粉碎美国的阴谋。
    中国人民外交学会对日和约小组负责人、前远东国际军事法庭法官梅汝璈继起发言。他指出，美国早在一九四七年七月，就曾策动对日单独媾和。去年九月十四日，杜鲁门政府又指令美国国务院进行对日单独媾和的活动。杜鲁门政府妄以为在它野蛮地镇压日本进步势力之后，便可以压迫其仆从国家，追随美国之后，与日本缔结单独的对日和约，并准备在单独媾和遭到强烈反对时，即片面地宣布与日本结束战争状态。梅汝璈强调说，美国单独对日媾和与武装日本的阴谋活动，是完全违背国际协议的，是非法的。美国这一威胁中国安全和远东和平的非法行动，必将引起世界人民，特别是曾遭日本军国主义侵略之苦的亚洲各国人民的坚决反对。
    日本问题专家庄涛从日本经济方面，说明日本正被美国拖上战争体制的道路。庄涛指出，日本去年的钢材年产量，估计已达三百万吨，超过一九四六年至一九四八年的钢材产量的总和，接近了日本战时（一九三八年）钢材的年产量。日本的炼油工业，亦复如此。日本经济的战争体制化，结果首先遭受危害的是日本人民。由于美国占领者在发动侵朝战争抢购军事物资的结果，日本的通货膨胀又已开始，物价从去年六月到九月，上涨了百分之十五，而工人工资则正相对激剧下降。此外，由于去年年底美国禁止日本向中国输出的结果，使日本产业界损失一百五十亿日元（约合四千七百万美元）。这种情况，造成了日本许多中小资本家的严重困难与破产。美国武装日本的结果，将使日本和平经济陷于窒息状态，并使日本走上毁灭的道路。日本广大人民必将起而坚决反对美国单独对日媾和与武装日本的阴谋。
    日本问题专家郑森禹发言指出，美国对日单独媾和的中心目的，在于进一步武装日本。实际上，美国已在利用日本人力、物力进行侵略战争。这种情况是中国人民不能容忍的，也是日本人民所反对的。在美国侵朝战争失败后，日本人民已经更加明了，日本追随美国进行侵略，只有在亚洲人民强大的反侵略力量面前遭受毁灭的命运，因此日本人民反对重新武装的运动已经更加广泛地发展了起来。
    中国人民外交学会副会长乔冠华指出：我们应扩大中朝人民在朝鲜战场上的胜利，彻底击败美帝国主义在东方武装日本的阴谋。我们应与欧洲人民热烈展开的反对美帝国主义武装西德的广泛运动配合起来，加强保卫世界和平的力量，使帝国主义挑拨新战争的阴谋根本不能实现。
    国际法专家周鲠生指出：美帝国主义现在突然加强进行单独对日缔和及武装日本的阴谋，是他感觉到在日本维持现状已很困难，而在朝鲜战场上遭到惨败后，美帝国主义认为今后如果进行侵略亚洲的战争，必须利用日本人民作炮灰。但是千千万万曾遭受日本帝国主义侵略的亚洲国家的人民，必将起而坚决反对美国这一阴谋。
    中国人民外交学会理事邵力子指出：对日和约的缔结应该导致和平，但是美国对日单独缔和的目的，却是导向战争。全世界爱好和平的人民应共同起来反对美国对日单独媾和和重新武装日本的阴谋。
    中国人民外交学会理事罗隆基认为在反对美国单独对日媾和反对武装日本的运动中，应继续深入并加强“抗美援朝保家卫国”的爱国主义思想教育。他主张全国各民主党派、各团体、各界人民一致参加到这一运动中来，并与日本人民联合起来，争取这一运动的成功。
    在会上发言的尚有张闻天、樊弘、曾炳钧等人，他们一致痛斥美国重新武装日本的阴谋，并表示希望远东各国人民联合起来，粉碎美国的阴谋。
    会议最后由张奚若作总结。他指出：中国人民应当展开一个反对美国单独对日媾和与武装日本的运动，并要求迅速缔结全面的对日和约，结束美国在日本的独裁统治。他在结束讲话时说：中国人民和全世界人民（包括日本人民在内）完全有力量粉碎美帝国主义的侵略计划。美国侵略者终必遭到可耻的失败。
