　　Patriotic Education at Wuhan University
　　Lin Gang
    Wuhan University's mobilization of students to participate in national defense construction is being carried out in conjunction with patriotic education. Through this education, whether students signed up or not, their political understanding has generally been raised a step further.

    Vividly Conduct Current Affairs Education

    Wuhan University's experience proves that current affairs education is of decisive significance in mobilizing students to participate in national defense construction.

    The basic ideological content of Wuhan University's current affairs education is: "Strive for initiative, prepare strength, and crush U.S. imperialist aggression." Only when the forces of peace-loving people are fully developed is it possible to stop war; or, when imperialism launches a war, to quickly eliminate it, so that the war does not expand and prolong, reducing sacrifices and losses.

    The result of Wuhan University's current affairs education is the reversal of the idea of "closing the door and building peace." Professor Yu Chichang, Dean of the School of Engineering, conducted current affairs education for students in this way: "For example, those of us who study hydraulic engineering all know that to build a sluice gate, we must use an enclosure to surround the water, drain the water, and then we can carry out construction inside the enclosure; the stronger the enclosure, the less likely water is to enter, and the more secure the project will be. This enclosure is our national border! Without an enclosure, there is no way to carry out water conservancy construction, and without national defense construction, there is no construction at all. Students, if U.S. imperialism comes, we cannot build any great projects."

    In carrying out current affairs education, another muddled idea was also clarified. For example, some students said: "I am determined to dedicate myself to the motherland, but the enemy has not yet come, let me study. When the war comes, I will never hesitate to sacrifice myself for the country!" The Wuhan University Party Branch pointed out sharply: This is a dangerous idea of passively waiting to be attacked. Because, from the time the United States provoked the war of aggression against Korea, our peaceful life has in fact been threatened. We are precisely for peaceful construction, so we must rapidly strengthen our national defense forces. Without strong national defense forces, there is nothing.

    Raise Individual Concerns to Concerns for National Security

    Generally speaking, the students of Wuhan University love the motherland, but some students' personal concerns have not been resolved: fear of death, attachment to family, worry about personal future.... Wuhan University's attitude towards students' personal concerns is not to criticize, and it also opposes the idea of "signing up for the army is progress, hesitation is backwardness," but rather to allow students to launch a full ideological struggle. Secretary-General Xu Maoyong said: "We must help students raise their personal concerns to concerns for national security."

    Therefore, Wuhan University's mobilization of students to participate in national defense construction particularly emphasizes "the determination to sacrifice personal interests and endure hardship." It is certain that in war, everyone has the possibility of sacrifice. As a revolutionary, one should recognize that sacrificing for the people and the motherland is the most glorious; we participate in national defense construction precisely to strive for survival.

    The general ideal of college students is to become experts and engineers. This is not only allowed, but should be encouraged. "After studying for three years, joining the army is also a loss to the country!" This statement is seemingly correct but actually wrong. The new concept should be that individual ideals should be subordinate to the motherland's grand ideals and the people's ideals. Today, the people's ideal is to rapidly establish a modernized and powerful national defense army with a large number of young people who have mastered culture and scientific knowledge. If we do not have a strong national defense army, the security of the motherland will lack a strong guarantee. Even if it is just a personal ideal, what is greater than participating in national defense construction and bringing lasting peace and happiness to the motherland and the people?

    Defend the Motherland, Defend the Mother

    Family issues are concentrated on the mother. Wuhan University put forward the slogan "Defend the Motherland! Defend the Mother!" One student wrote in his letter of determination: "Let others fight to protect my mother? I cannot allow myself to be so selfish." A touching slogan on the wall of the gymnasium: "If mother asks me where I am going? And what I am doing? I want to fight for the motherland and protect you, dear mother." This is a famous line from the song "If people don't offend me, I won't offend them," a student quoted it in his letter of determination, this student completely integrated his love for his mother and his love for the motherland.

    Wuhan University's experience proves that there is only one way to patiently persuade parents who obstruct their children. Every mother is also willing for her child to defend the motherland, so they can be persuaded. One mother disagreed with her son's registration and went to see Secretary-General Xu Maoyong. Xu Maoyong told her a story: In the old liberated areas, there were three situations of mothers sending their sons to join the army: one was a glorious mother who took the initiative to send her son to join the army; one was a mother whose husband or son was killed by the enemy, and the mother sent another son to join the army to avenge her father and brother; and another was a mother who was killed by the enemy, and on her deathbed, she asked her son to join the army to avenge her. Today, U.S. imperialism does not allow us to live a peaceful life and wants to persecute us. Naturally, we advocate that before unfortunate things happen, mothers take the initiative to send their sons to join the army to defend the country and protect their mothers! After listening to this story, the mother changed her mind. The process of persuasion is a process of carrying out patriotic education for the mother. The mother originally disagreed with her son joining the military academy, later allowed it, and finally encouraged her son to join the military academy. This is a process of raising the level of consciousness, so resistance is transformed into assistance.

    The Driving Force of Professors

    Teachers were initially reluctant to see students, especially third and fourth-year students, leave midway to join military academies. Under the major premise of "obeying the motherland's grand ideal," the professors of Wuhan University transformed personal feelings into patriotic feelings and correctly handled this issue. When the teachers thought that they had cultivated a large number of outstanding young people for the motherland, and that the heroic behavior of the students on the national defense line was precisely their glory, the incorrect idea of "wasting effort" was dispelled.

    The Resist America, Aid Korea movement educated the teachers, and the teachers in turn became an important force in promoting the movement. The professors of Wuhan University, from "reluctant" to "encouraging" to "actively calling" on students to enthusiastically participate in national defense construction. Now, the majority of professors in the school have also written letters of determination to swear to the motherland: "We are prepared to go to the places where the motherland needs us most at any time!"

### 武汉大学的爱国主义教育

　　武汉大学的爱国主义教育
　　林钢
    武汉大学动员学生参加国防建设，是结合着爱国主义教育来进行的。通过这次教育，无论报名或没有报名的学生，政治认识普遍地提高了一步。
    生动地进行时事教育
    武汉大学的经验证明：动员学生参加国防建设，时事教育有着决定性的意义。
    武汉大学时事教育的基本思想内容是：“争取主动，准备实力，粉碎美帝侵略”，只有和平人民的力量得到充分发展，才有可能制止战争；或者，在帝国主义发动战争的时候，迅速消灭它，使战争不致于扩大和拖长，减少牺牲，减少损失。
    武汉大学进行时事教育的结果，扭转了“关起大门、和平建设”的思想。工学院院长余炽昌教授是这样对学生进行时事教育的：“譬如说，我们学水利工程的都知道，要建筑一个水闸，必须用围堤把水围住，抽去水，然后才能在围堤内施工；围堤越坚固，水就越不易进来，工程就越有把握。这围堤就是我们的国境呀！没有围堤就没法进行水利建设，没有国防建设便没有一切建设。同学们，美帝国主义来了，我们是不能修建什么巨大工程的。”
    在进行时事教育中，也澄清了另一种糊涂想法。如有的同学说：“献身祖国，我有决心，但现在敌人还没有来，让我学习吧。战争来了，我决不惜以身殉国！”武汉大学党支部尖锐地指出：这是危险的挨打思想。因为，从美国挑起侵朝战争时起，我们的和平生活在事实上已经受到威胁了。我们正是为了和平建设，所以要迅速壮大国防力量。没有强大的国防力量，便没有一切。
    把个人顾虑提高到对祖国安全的顾虑
    一般说来，武汉大学的同学都热爱祖国，但是有的学生的个人顾虑没有解除：怕死，留恋家庭，担心个人前途……。武汉大学对于学生个人顾虑的态度，不是打击，也反对“报名参军就是进步，犹豫就是落后”的提法，而是让同学们展开充分的思想斗争。徐懋庸秘书长说：“我们要帮助同学，把个人顾虑提高到对祖国安全的顾虑上来。”
    所以，武汉大学动员学生参加国防建设，特别强调“要有牺牲个人利益和有吃苦耐劳的决心”。肯定的，在战争里，每人都有牺牲的可能性。作为一个革命者，应该认识为人民祖国而牺牲是最光荣的；我们参加国防建设，正是为了争取生存。
    大学生一般的理想是作专家和工程师。这不唯允许，而且应该有这种理想。“学了三年，参加了军队，对国家讲起来也是个损失！”这种说法却是似是而实非的。新的观念，应该是个人理想应当服从祖国的远大理想、人民的理想。今天人民的理想是迅速建立一支有大批掌握文化与科学知识的青年参加的、现代化的强大国防军。我们若没有强大的国防军，祖国的安全就缺乏有力的保障。就算个人理想吧，还有什么比参加国防建设，为祖国为人民带来永久的和平与幸福这理想更伟大呢？
    保卫祖国，保卫母亲
    家庭问题集中在母亲身上。武汉大学提出了“保卫祖国！保卫母亲！”的口号。一个学生在他的决心书里写道：“让别人去拚命，保卫我的母亲么？我不能允许自己这样自私。”体育馆墙上一幅动人的标语：“假如母亲问我去向那里？去做什么事情？我要为祖国而战斗，保卫你呀，亲爱的母亲。”这是“人不犯我，我不犯人”歌词中的名句，一个同学把它引来写在自己的决心书上，这个同学把对母亲的爱和对祖国的爱，完全融合在一体了。
    武汉大学的经验证明：对于家长的阻挠，只有耐心说服一个方法。每一个母亲也愿意自己的孩子去保卫祖国，因此是可以说服的。有一位母亲不同意儿子报名，她去见徐懋庸秘书长。徐懋庸向她讲述了一段故事：从前在老解放区，有三种母亲送子参军的情形：一种是光荣的母亲主动送子参军；一种是丈夫或儿子被敌人打死，母亲送另外的一个儿子参军替父兄报仇；还有一种是母亲遭敌人杀害，临死叫儿子参军报仇。今天，美帝国主义不让我们过和平生活，要迫害我们。自然，我们是主张在不幸的事情降临以前，母亲主动送子参军，保家卫国，保卫母亲！这位母亲听了这段故事，改变了自己的主张。说服的过程是对母亲进行爱国主义教育的过程。母亲原先不同意儿子参加军校，后来允许，最后又鼓励儿子参加军校，这是一个觉悟程度提高的过程，因此，阻力便化为助力了。
    教授的推动力量
    学生，特别是三、四年级的学生参加军校，老师最初也是舍不得他们中途离去的。武汉大学的教授们，在“服从祖国远大理想”的大前提下，化个人感情为爱国主义的感情，正确地处理了这个问题。当老师们想到自己替祖国培养了大批优秀青年，同学们在国防线上所表现的英雄行为正是自己的光荣的时候，“白费心血”的不正确的想法便打消了。
    抗美援朝运动教育了老师，老师回过来又成为推动运动的重要力量。武汉大学的教授们，从“舍不得”到“鼓励”，到“积极号召”同学踊跃参加国防建设。现在全校大多数教授也写了决心书向祖国宣誓：“我们准备随时到祖国最需要的地方去！”
