Xinhua News Agency, 25th -- The Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council, to assist workers' children in attending school, introduced 18,240 workers' children to municipal middle and primary schools in the autumn semester of 1950.

　　Before liberation, workers were exploited and oppressed, so their children had few opportunities to attend school or were unable to maintain regular studies. As a result, their general education level was relatively low, making it difficult to pass entrance exams. Last semester, many workers' children failed to enroll due to poor exam results. Starting last autumn, the Beijing Municipal Government's Bureau of Culture and Education accepted the Municipal Trade Union Council's suggestion to adopt a system of admitting workers' children to lower grades when they failed the entrance exam. Furthermore, workers' children who were already enrolled were given priority in applying for tuition reductions or scholarships. At the same time, the Municipal People's Government allocated additional funds to expand classes and increased the number of scholarship recipients in municipal schools from 20% to 40% to facilitate the enrollment of workers' children. Consequently, the Labor Insurance Department of the Municipal Trade Union Council introduced a large number of workers' children to schools. From June to the end of September last year, a total of 1,038 new students were introduced to middle schools, along with 37 students entering existing classes; and 17,165 students at the primary school level.

　　京市总工会在去年秋季
    介绍万余工人子女入学
    【新华社二十五日讯】北京市总工会为帮助工人子女入学，在一九五零年秋季的一学期中，介绍了一万八千二百四十个工人子女进入市立中学或小学。
    由于解放前工人受剥削或压迫，工人子女很少有入学的机会或无法保持经常学习，所以一般文化程度较低，通过入学考试较困难。上学期就有很多工人子女，因为考试成绩不好未能入学。去年秋季开始北京市政府文教局接受市总工会建议，对工人子女入学考试不及格时，采取降级录取入学的办法，并对已入学的工人子女给予优先申请减免学费或助学金的待遇。同时市人民政府增拨经费扩充班次，并将市立各校助学金名额由百分之二十增加到百分之四十，以增加工人子女入学的便利。于是市总工会劳保部即大量介绍工人子女入学。从去年六月到九月底，前后共介绍了入中学的新生一千零三十八人，编级生三十七人；小学程度的学生一万七千一百六十五人。
