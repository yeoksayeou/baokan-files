　　The Greatness of Lenin-Stalin Thought

　　In their struggles, the communist parties of all countries are guided by the ever-victorious Marxist-Leninist theory, which is a tested and reliable ideological weapon.

　　The power and vitality of Marxism-Leninism lie in the fact that it fills the Communist Party with confidence in its work and gives it the ability to grasp the direction of the overall situation. Marxism-Leninism correctly reflects "the advanced theory of the needs of the development of social material life, raising this theory to the level it should be, and striving to fully utilize the mobilizing, organizing, and transforming power of this theory" (Stalin). Marxism-Leninism is a generalization and summary of the experiences of the international workers' movement, and therefore it is the key to scientifically understanding the laws of class struggle and social development.

　　Armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, the communist parties of various countries are playing an increasingly powerful role in the course of history, in human life and development, and are more actively and boldly paving the way for advanced social forces.

　　The Soviet Union is a great concrete manifestation of Marxist-Leninist thought. The theory of scientific communism has been confirmed by the socialist practice of the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet people have built a socialist society and crushed fascism in open battle, leading the world's struggle for peace and advancing victoriously towards communism; these victories have created an unprecedented revolution in the consciousness of the people and in the minds of the broad masses. Now every ordinary person in a bourgeois country sees that it is possible to overthrow capitalist exploitation and that working people are capable of building their own free lives.

　　But the impact of the great ideas of Leninism does not stop there. Lenin and Stalin not only proved that it is possible to overthrow capitalism; they also instructed and taught us how to build a new, communist society, and they convinced the people in practice that under the leadership of a Marxist revolutionary party, there is no difficulty that the working class cannot overcome. No one in the world has done as much work as Lenin and Stalin for the liberation of the working people and for the establishment of a happy and fulfilling life.

　　The Soviet Union, leading the camp of peace and democracy, has grown strong in the great struggle against the old world. Once backward Russia has become a powerful socialist industrial country. The Soviet working class finally smashed the bourgeois-landlord state machine, united the working people and liquidated all the exploiting classes. Socialism has demonstrated unprecedented possibilities for developing the productive forces, increasing labor productivity, and improving the people's lives. Due to the industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture, as well as the complete abolition of private ownership of the means of production, the Soviet economy is absolutely immune to crises. All the inherent possibilities of the revival of capitalism in the Soviet Union have been eliminated; thus, a rate of development has been generated that is not only unprecedented but also unimaginable in any other society.

　　The socialist construction of the Soviet Union was obstructed by the enemies of Leninism, defeatists, and traitors. Stalin consolidated the Bolshevik Party and defeated the enemies of Leninism. Lenin's cause was saved, and the Soviet people cleared the way for an unprecedented victory in history, the victory of socialism in a country surrounded by capitalist countries.

　　The Bolshevik Party has always taken Marxism-Leninism as its compass in the past and present, in everything. This is the source of its strength and power. The reason why the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been able to become the fighting headquarters of the working class is that its ranks have always been united ideologically and educated on the basis of Marxist-Leninist theory. Lenin and Stalin further developed Marxism based on the new conditions of the era of imperialism, when the proletarian revolution had been put on the agenda and the mobilizing and organizing significance of advanced revolutionary theory had been further strengthened.

　　Lenin and Stalin were great theorists of the working class and creative inheritors of Marx's doctrine. Lenin elucidated the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country and discovered the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat - the Soviets. Comrade Stalin, the successor to Lenin's cause, interpreted and clarified the advanced theory on these issues. For example, the question of the decisive role of the Communist Party in building communism, the question of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture; the question of consolidating the socialist state by all possible means under the conditions of being surrounded by capitalism; he created a complete doctrine of the socialist state, fully developed the national and colonial questions, and other important issues. Comrade Stalin is an ever-victorious socialist theorist and a great scientific genius. In fact, he made invaluable contributions to all departments of social science: political economy, dialectical and historical materialism, history, linguistics, military science, and so on. Stalin planned the strategy and tactics of the proletarian movement that could be applied to extremely complex environments. He raised Marxist-Leninist theory to a new, higher stage.

　　The writings of Lenin and Stalin are the greatest wealth of mankind. In the struggle for the victory of the working class cause, people draw new strength from the writings of Lenin and Stalin and find answers to the most pressing problems of the moment. Under the shining light of Lenin-Stalin revolutionary thought, the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism have achieved great successes. Leninism pointed out the correct path to break free from the shackles of imperialism and strive for liberation, that is, the path to building a free socialist life.

　　Lenin and Stalin scientifically predicted the further development of the general crisis of capitalism and the inevitability of certain countries constantly breaking away from the capitalist system through revolution; the course of historical development has confirmed the correctness of this prediction. Due to the victory of the Soviet state in the war against fascism and the great liberation mission of the Soviet army, a number of people's democratic countries have emerged. Under the guidance of Lenin-Stalin doctrine and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet people, the working people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania are successfully building socialism.

　　The example of the Chinese Communist Party proves the tremendous power of the communist parties of various countries working on the basis of Marxist-Leninist theory. The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party and its tested leader Mao Zedong, smashed the shackles of feudalism and capitalist enslavement, giving a devastating blow to the entire imperialist colonial system. The Soviet Union and China have formed a strong and powerful alliance, which is the most powerful factor in the struggle for peace.

　　The greatness of Lenin-Stalin thought is brilliantly reflected in the growth of the international communist movement. The development and consolidation of the Communist Party in almost all countries of the world is the best proof of the great power of Leninism. Their ranks boast eighteen million communists, not including the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! This is a great army of the people, wholeheartedly dedicated to the noble struggle for the happiness and liberation of the working people. The ever-victorious nature of communism is a major law of today, and no force can reverse the wheels of history to stop the realization of Lenin-Stalin's ideas.

　　It is futile for the American imperialists to try to scare the communists and organize a movement of terror against them. Communists are not cowardly people; they are students of Lenin and Stalin. They know how to fight for the cause of the working class and all working people.

　　And leading the warriors for peace forward is the great successor to Lenin's cause—Stalin. Stalin embodies the spirit, honor, and conscience of our era. The working people of the world know that Stalin is peace, Stalin is victory!

　　The proletariat in all countries, the working people of the world, repeatedly look up to Stalin. They see Stalin as the hope for maintaining peace. Stalin is the symbol and hope of the impending liberation of all oppressed people. The people of Africa groaning under the shackles of the colonizers, the Malayans and Indonesians fighting for independence, the blacks and Indians dying of hunger and poverty, the Korean men and women taking up arms to defend their homeland, all associate their hopes for a free life with the name of Stalin. The peasants of Italy, the dockworkers of France, the miners of Scotland, the steelworkers of the Ruhr, and the tenant farmers of Yugoslavia firmly believe that Stalin will help them break the shackles of capitalist enslavement. Hundreds of millions of people in China and the people's democratic countries see Stalin as their teacher and dearest friend. This love and gratitude of the whole world towards Stalin is one of the characteristics of the present age.

　　With Stalin, the working people and progressive humanity of the world will safeguard peace and thwart the evil plans of the arrogant imperialist warmongers.

### 列宁—斯大林思想的伟大性

专栏：

　　列宁—斯大林思想的伟大性
    一切国家的共产党在它们的斗争中都是以无往而不胜利的马列主义理论为指南的，它是一个经过考验的可靠的思想武器。
    马列主义之所以有力量，有生气，是在于它使共产党在工作上充满了信心，在大局上有把握方向的能力。马列主义正确地反映了“社会物质生活发展需要的先进理论，把这个理论提高到它所应有的水平，并努力来彻底利用这个理论所有的动员、组织和改造的力量”（斯大林）。马列主义是国际工人阶级运动的经验的概括和总结，因而它是科学地了解阶级斗争和社会发展规律的钥匙。
    为马列主义理论所武装了的各国共产党，正在发挥它对于历史进程，对于人类生活和发展的越来越强大的作用，正在越来越积极和大胆地为社会先进力量铺平道路。
    苏联是马克思—列宁思想的伟大的具体表现。科学的共产主义的理论已为苏联的社会主义的实践所证实。苏维埃人民在列宁—斯大林的党领导之下，建设了社会主义的社会并且在公开的战斗中粉碎了法西斯主义，领导着全世界的和平斗争并且正在胜利地向着共产主义迈进；他们的这些胜利，在人民的觉悟上，广大群众的思想上，造成了一个史无先例的革命。现在每一个资产阶级国家的普通人都看到，推翻资本主义剥削是可能的，劳动人民是能够建立他们自己的自由的生活的。
    但是，列宁主义的伟大思想所发生的影响绝不止此。列宁和斯大林不仅证明了可能推翻资本主义；他们还指示和教导了我们怎样来建设一个新的、共产主义的社会，他们从实践中说服了人民，在一个马克思主义的革命政党领导之下的工人阶级，是没有什么困难不能克服的。为了劳动人民的解放，为了快乐幸福的生活的建立，世界上的任何人都没有做过像列宁和斯大林那样多的工作。
    领导着和平民主阵营的苏联，是在反抗旧世界的巨大斗争中成长壮大的。一度落后的俄国已经变成强大的社会主义的工业国家了。苏联的工人阶级终于粉碎了资产阶级——地主的国家机器，团结了劳动人民和清算了各剥削阶级。社会主义已经显示了发展生产力、提高劳动生产率和改善人民生活的前所未闻的可能性。由于国家的工业化和农业的集体化，以及生产资料私有制的彻底废除，苏联的经济是绝对不受危机的威胁的。资本主义在苏联复活的一切内在可能性都被铲除了；因而产生了这样一种的发展速度，那不但是从来没有过的，也不是任何其他社会所能想像的。
    苏联的社会主义建设受到了列宁主义的敌人、失败主义者、和叛徒的阻挠。斯大林巩固了布尔什维克党并击败了列宁主义的敌人。列宁的事业获救，苏联人民为历史上空前的胜利扫清了道路，这个胜利就是社会主义在资本主义国家所包围的一个国家中的胜利。
    布尔什维克党在过去和现在、在任何事情上，都以马列主义作为南针。这就是它的力量与威力的来源。苏联共产党之能够成为工人阶级战斗的指挥部，是因为它的队伍总是从思想上被团结起来的，是受了以马列主义的理论为基础的教育的。列宁和斯大林根据帝国主义时代的新条件，在无产阶级革命已被提上了日程，先进的革命理论的动员和组织意义越发加强的时候，进一步发展了马克思主义。
    列宁和斯大林是工人阶级的伟大的理论家，是马克思学说的创造性的承继者。列宁阐明了社会主义在一个国家里胜利的可能性，发现了无产阶级专政的国家形式——苏维埃。列宁事业的继承人斯大林同志，诠释了并阐明了关于这些问题方面的先进的理论。例如，共产党在建设共产主义中决定作用的问题，社会主义的工业化和农业的社会主义化问题；在为资本主义包围的条件下，以一切可能的方法巩固社会主义国家的问题；他创造了完整的社会主义的国家学说，充分发挥了民族与殖民地问题，以及其他重要的问题。斯大林同志是一个无往而不胜利的社会主义的理论家，是一个伟大的科学天才。实际上，他对社会科学的一切部门：政治经济、辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义、历史、语言学、军事科学等等，都作了非常宝贵的贡献。斯大林规划了可以应用于极为复杂的环境中的无产阶级运动的战略和策略。他把马列主义的理论提高到一个新的、更高的阶段。
    列宁和斯大林的著作是人类最大的财产。在争取工人阶级事业胜利的斗争中，人们从列宁和斯大林的著作里吸取了新的力量，找到当前最迫切的问题的答案。在列宁—斯大林革命思想光辉的照耀之下，和平、民主、社会主义的力量获致了伟大的成就。列宁主义为挣脱帝国主义枷锁、争取解放指出了正确的道路，即建设自由的社会主义生活的道路。
    列宁和斯大林科学地预言了资本主义总危机进一步发展以及某些国家不断地经过革命而摆脱资本主义制度的必然性；历史发展的进程，证实了这种预言的正确性。由于苏维埃国家在反对法西斯主义战争中的胜利以及苏维埃军队的伟大的解放使命，出现了一些人民民主国家。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，在列宁—斯大林学说的指导之下，在苏维埃人民兄弟般的援助之下，正在顺利地建设着社会主义。
    中国共产党的例子证明，在马列主义理论基础上进行工作的各国共产党所具有的巨大力量。伟大的中国人民，在光辉的共产党及其经过考验的领袖毛泽东领导之下，打碎了封建主义及资本主义奴役的枷锁，给予整个帝国主义殖民制度以毁灭性的打击。苏联和中国已结成了一个坚强有力的同盟，这是争取和平的最有力的因素。
    列宁—斯大林思想的伟大性，光辉地反映在国际共产主义运动的成长中。共产党在几乎全世界一切国家中的发展与巩固，便是列宁主义伟大力量的最好的证明。他们的队伍拥有一千八百万共产党人，而苏联的共产党尚不在内！这是一支人民大军，他们全心全意为争取劳动人民的幸福及其解放的崇高斗争而献身。共产主义无往而不胜利，这是当今一条主要的规律，任何力量都不能扭转历史的车轮，来阻止列宁—斯大林的思想实现。
    美国帝国主义者想吓住共产党人，想组织一种恐怖运动来反对他们，那是枉然的。共产党人并不是那种怯懦的人们，他们是列宁和斯大林的学生。他们懂得怎样为工人阶级和一切劳动人民的事业而斗争。
    而领导和平战士们前进的则是列宁事业的伟大的继承人—斯大林。斯大林具体表现了我们这一时代的精神、荣誉和良心。全世界的劳动人民都知道，斯大林就是和平，斯大林就是胜利！
    一切国家中的无产阶级，全世界的劳动人民一再地仰望着斯大林。他们把斯大林看成保持和平的希望。斯大林是所有被压迫人民行将解放的象征与希望。呻吟在殖民者的桎梏之下的非洲各族人民，为独立而奋斗的马来亚人和印尼人，因饥饿与贫困而奄奄一息的黑人与印度人，拿起武器捍卫祖国的朝鲜男女们，全都把他们对于自由生活的希望和斯大林的名字联系起来。意大利的农民，法国的码头工人，苏格兰的矿工，鲁尔的钢铁工人和南斯拉夫的雇农，坚决相信，斯大林将帮助他们打碎资本主义奴役的枷锁。中国和人民民主国家的亿万人民把斯大林看成他们的导师与最亲爱的朋友。全世界对斯大林的这种爱戴与感激乃是当代的特征之一。
    随着斯大林，世界劳动人民和进步人类将维护和平，挫败狂妄的帝国主义战争贩子的罪恶计划。
