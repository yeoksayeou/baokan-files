　　Saved from a Sudden Illness on the Train
    Grateful for Chairman Mao's Kindness

To Minister Teng of the Ministry of Railways, Please forward to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:

    I am a resident of the Thirteenth Village of Shancheng Town, Hailong County. On December 23rd, I was on the No. 101 Mass Train from Beijing to Jilin, returning from Yingpan to Shancheng Town. While the train was underway, I suddenly fell ill. At this critical moment, the conductor and train attendants carried me to a sleeper car. They busied themselves pouring water for me, comforting me, and telling me not to worry. The conductor ran back and forth trying to find a doctor for me. With great effort, the conductor found a comrade from a health team to examine me, who determined that I had "wool boils." The health team comrade said that it was fortunate that it was discovered early, otherwise my life would have been in danger. At that time, I was both afraid and did not know how to thank the conductor enough. The treatment required needles and garlic, and the anxious conductor and train attendants ran around until they finally found them. The health team spent a long time treating me and finally cured me. I didn't have a penny on me at the time, which I was extremely ashamed of (I later realized that even if I had money to offer as thanks, they certainly wouldn't have accepted it). At the time, I only felt gratitude in my heart. I wanted nothing more than to kowtow to the conductor. I asked the conductor his surname, and he said it was Bian. I said, "Conductor Bian, you saved my life, and I will never forget your life-saving kindness." The conductor said very kindly to me, "Our Mass Train Youth Team, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, should do this, and the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have told us to do this. We should serve the people. Old man, you should thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" The conductor's words moved me even more. I thought about how when the Communist Party came the year before, they led us to turn over a new leaf, and this time they saved my life again. How should I thank and repay the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao? The conductor said, "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are so good to you, you should write a letter to thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Last night, I couldn't sleep all night at home. I tossed and turned in bed, thinking about the situation when the Communist Party led the liberation, and about the conductor and health team comrades treating me on the train. I could not forget the conductor's words at all times. All of these things should be thanked to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Early this morning, I found the culture and education committee member to write a letter to Chairman Mao on my behalf. Only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can there be such conductors and health team comrades who truly serve the people.

    A few days ago, our village also discussed the matter of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao saved my life, and my family's life has just gotten better. The American devils want us to be slaves of a subjugated nation again. I must take practical actions to produce more in the rear and produce more grain to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army so that the American devils—the warmongers—can be eliminated as soon as possible, only then I would be worthy of the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

　　在火车上生急病得了救
    感谢毛主席的恩情铁道部滕部长  请转中央人民政府毛主席钧鉴：
    我是海龙县山城镇十三村的居民。十二月二十三日那天，我坐北京到吉林的一○一次群众号列车，从营盘回山城镇。车行在半道上，我忽然得了急病。正在这危急的时候，有车长和列车员同志们把我背到卧车上，他们忙着给我倒水，安慰我，叫我不用着急，车长又前后跑着给我找医生。车长费了很大劲，才找到一个卫生队的同志给我看病，知道我得的是“羊毛疔”。卫生队的同志说，幸亏发现的很早，如果晚的话，我的性命就有危险了。那时候我一方面害怕；另一方面不知怎样感谢车长才好。治病要用针和蒜，急的车长和列车员同志东跑西奔，到底都找到了。卫生队费了半天事，才给治好。我当时腰包一个钱没带，真是惭愧极了（后来才知道，就是有钱送谢，他们当然也不会要的），我当时只有心中感激，我恨不得去给车长叩头，我问车长贵姓？他说姓边。我说：“边车长，你救了我这一条生命，我一辈子也忘不了你的救命恩情。”车长还很和蔼地对我说：“我们群众号青年包车组，在共产党和毛主席领导下，这样做是应该的，也是共产党和毛主席告诉我们这样做的，我们应该为人民服务。老大爷，你应该感谢共产党和毛主席才对呀！”车长这一说，更使我心里受了感动，我想起前年共产党来的时候，领导我们翻身，这回又救我一条生命，我该怎样来感谢和报答共产党和毛主席的恩情呢！车长说：“共产党和毛主席对你这样好，你应该写一封信谢谢共产党和毛主席。”我昨晚回家一宿没睡着觉，在炕上翻来复去想起了共产党领导翻身的情形，又想起了在火车里车长和卫生队的同志给治病的情形。车长的话，我时时刻刻也忘不了。这些事情都应该感谢共产党和毛主席。今天一起早，我就找文教委员代笔，给毛主席写信。唯有在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，才有这样真正为人民服务的车长和卫生队同志。
    头几天我们村里也讨论了抗美援朝保家卫国的事情，共产党和毛主席救了我的生命，我家的日子刚刚过好，美国鬼子又想叫咱们当亡国奴，我一定要拿实际行动在后方多生产，多打粮食，支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，早日消灭美国鬼子——战争贩子们，才对得起共产党和毛主席的恩情。
