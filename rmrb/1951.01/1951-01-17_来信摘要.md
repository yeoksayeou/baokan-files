Letter Summary

Comrade Xu Shaozong writes: Hoping to print a map of the motherland's resources.
	After more than two months of anti-US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country propaganda and education, we have further realized the greatness and loveliness of our motherland, and we want to contribute greater strength to our motherland. However, many people still do not sufficiently understand the greatness of the motherland and the victory of the people. Especially because of the long-term reactionary education of the Kuomintang, many people have developed a sense of inferiority, only hearing about the large coal mines, iron mines, forests, oil fields, cotton, etc. of the United States, but not knowing much about the rich resources of our motherland. In order to help the people understand the richness and loveliness of our country, I hope that our cultural institutions can print a map of the distribution of our country's resources and products (including agriculture, animal husbandry, minerals, forests, etc.) for the people to study.

Fuxin miner Ke Fu writes: Suggesting improvements in book and magazine distribution.
	In recent months, I have seen frequent errors in the distribution of magazines and books. According to what I know, the following magazine publishers often make mistakes: "Study," Volume 3, Issue 1, a special oversized issue, was over-distributed to the Cultural and Educational Department of the Beipiao Mining Area Committee by five copies (the original subscription was five copies). The Cultural and Educational Department of the Fuxin Mining Area Committee subscribed to twelve copies, but received double that amount (details for Volume 3 onwards are unknown). The People's Publishing House's "New Observer," Volume 2, Issue 1, published on January 10, 1951, was over-distributed to the Cultural and Educational Department of the Fuxin Mining Area Committee by fifteen copies (the original subscription was fifteen copies). In Volume 1, Issue 11, the subscription had expired, and a list was received, but twelve copies of Issue 12 were still sent. The "Propagandist Handbook" published by the Northeast Branch of Xinhua Bookstore, Issue 7, was over-distributed to the Cultural and Educational Department of the Fuxin Mining Area Committee by fifty copies (the original subscription was fifty copies). If there are over-deliveries here, it is very likely that there are under-deliveries elsewhere. I think this is mainly due to the carelessness and lack of responsibility of the distribution comrades. I suggest that the responsible comrades of the above-mentioned magazine publishers seriously check and improve the distribution work.

Comrade Ru Bing writes: Hoping bookstores can establish rental departments.
	I hope that bookstores can establish rental departments so that readers can obtain a lot of knowledge and education at a very low cost. I feel that the vast number of young people urgently need to read some excellent domestic and foreign literary works, such as "The Real Man," "How Steel Was Tempered," and many new literary works in our country. However, ordinary readers cannot afford to buy them themselves, and there are not many libraries, and there are time and location restrictions, etc. It would be more convenient and timely for bookstores to establish rental departments. Therefore, I put forward this suggestion. I hope that bookstores can consider this in the spirit of serving the masses.

Comrade Cao Dianmao writes: Hoping to find a way to solve the supply of medicines.
	Recently, the prices of medicines such as penicillin, streptomycin, and sulfa drugs have been rising daily. For example, penicillin has risen from 13,500 yuan to 40,000 yuan. Therefore, in addition to suggesting that the government should impose effective sanctions on speculative merchants, it should also urge the institutions that can manufacture these medicines to manufacture them in large quantities (such as the Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Institute, which can manufacture penicillin) to meet the needs of the people and save foreign exchange.

The Tong City Federation of Trade Unions Correspondence Group writes: Wang Qingrong improved the reverberatory furnace.
	The workers of New China have vigorous work enthusiasm and infinite creativity, and they are constantly creating new achievements. Wang Qingrong, a worker at the state-owned Datong City Chemical Plant, used to repair reverberatory furnaces according to the old methods learned from Tianjin, and had to burn out more than forty splint irons every month. After more than a month of research, Wang Qingrong discovered that burning Datong coal leaves no coal ash on the furnace plate, which is different from burning Kailuan coal. Therefore, when repairing the next furnace, he thickened the furnace plate and increased the slope of the snout iron. In this way, the splint iron was no longer burned out. Every month, this can save the equivalent of three thousand catties of millet in losses compared to before.

Yuan Che Group of the private Jiuru Iron Factory, worker Yue Tongzheng, improved the chuck, increasing efficiency fourfold. In the past, when Yuan Che Group was turning inner sleeves, it took ten minutes to mount the chuck each time, and on average only three could be turned per hour. Yue Tongzheng, a worker in the group, after three days of research, converted the old live chuck into a new fixed chuck. During work, only tightening a screw is enough to install the chuck. The new fixed chuck is convenient to use and shortens the stopping time. Fifteen inner sleeves can be turned every hour, increasing efficiency fourfold. He was therefore praised by the municipal government and received a material reward from the factory.

Comrade Zhang Enkui and other comrades from Shanxi write: Rural cooperatives organize blacksmith shops.
	Since winter, the cooperatives of eight villages including Xianglu Jiao, Huo Jia Yao, and Dong Ya Di in Licheng County have organized a total of thirteen blacksmith shops, repairing and making 1,636 pieces of agricultural implements for farmers to welcome the spring plowing and production. These agricultural implements are of good quality and low price, and are very popular among farmers. Everyone praises the cooperatives for seeking benefits for the masses.

Comrade Liu Derong writes: Farmers in Yu County restore production and buy livestock.
	Liangjiazhai Village in Yu County, Shanxi Province, which was devastated by the Japanese invaders, has gradually restored production. In 1940, the village had seventy head of draft animals, which were all looted by the Japanese invaders. After liberation, the masses were able to produce with peace of mind, and after last year's bumper harvest, the farmers had surplus grain. This winter, under the leadership of the village cadres, everyone pooled funds and self-woven native cloth and other materials, and went to other areas to buy back sixteen head of cattle. The masses saw that the cattle they bought were very good and the prices were also reasonable, and they asked to buy more. The local People's Bank branch provided loan assistance, and prepared to buy ten more head in the second round.

Wang Fangming from Fengcheng County, Liaodong writes: Different results from two different feeding methods.
	The masses in Hu Family Village generally have the idea that "livestock grow hair, which is naturally on the outside, and there is no need to build a pen to protect them from the cold." Therefore, they are very unconcerned about livestock breeding. Most of the livestock pens in the village are just a shed supported by four pillars, which does not block the wind or snow; the feeding is also careless, and no attention is paid to adding feed and water. The livestock either die or become thin. For example, Qi Lu Jiao Si Zhang, who raised three or four cows, only cared about other work every day, and did not care about adding feed. Although he engaged in sideline business for a year, he lost a large cow. Armed Committee Member Li Zhenqing also froze a donkey to death because he did not care about feeding it.

	However, the situation in Liu Family Village is completely different. They accepted the lessons of the livestock suffering from southern fengsu last year. The village cadres often educate the farmers on livestock feeding and management, and the masses have a good understanding of livestock feeding and management. After entering the winter, they began to add grass and feed, and repair the livestock pens. They carefully feed their livestock. Forty-eight out of the fifty-eight households in the first lu raise livestock. This year, they all have pens and sheds, and the surroundings of the pens are tied with firewood and grass to form windproof fences, with a small door in the middle, so that the livestock do not get cold at all. Because everyone pays attention to forage, adding feed, and fetching clean water for the livestock, this year, every household's livestock is full of waist and round of body.

专栏：来信摘要

　　来信摘要
    徐绍宗同志来信：希望印制祖国资源地图
    经过两个多月来的抗美援朝保家卫国运动的宣传教育，我们是进一步认识到祖国的伟大和可爱，我们要为祖国贡献出更大的力量。但是也有不少人对伟大的祖国和人民的胜利是认识不够的。尤其是因为长期受国民党的反动教育，造成了很多人的自卑心理，只听说美国的什么大煤矿，大铁矿、森林、油田、棉花、……而对祖国的资源富藏却不大清楚。为了帮助人民了解我们国家的富饶与可爱，我希望我们的文化机关能够印制一幅我国资源、物产分布地图（包括农、畜、矿产、森林等），以供人民学习之用。
    阜新矿珂夫来信：建议改进书刊发行工作
    近月来我见到杂志书籍的发行常发生错误，仅据我所知道的有以下杂志社经常发错：学习三卷一期的特大号多发给北票矿区委员会文教部五册（原实订五册）。阜新矿区委员会文教部订了十二册，多发了一倍（三卷以后不详）。人民出版社的《新观察》一九五一年一月十日出版的二卷一期多给阜新矿区委员会文教部发了十五册（原实订十五册）。在一卷十一期时，该订户已满期，同时并收到了清单，但十二期又发给了十二册。新华书店东北总分店出版的宣传员手册，第七期多发给阜新矿区委员会文教部五十册（原实订五十册）。这里多发了，另外的地方就很可能少发。我想这主要是发行同志的粗心大意，责任心不强。我建议上述杂志社负责同志认真检查，改进发行工作。
    如冰同志来信：希望书店能成立租阅部
    我希望各书店能够建立租阅部，以便读者能化费很少的代价得到很多的知识和教育。我觉得现在广大的青年群众，迫切需要阅读一些国内外的优良的文艺著作，比如《真正的人》、《钢铁是怎样炼成的》之类，以及我国许多新的文艺作品，可是一般读者自己无力购买，图书馆不多，又有时间地点等等的限制，不如书店建立租阅部来得方便和供应及时，所以我提这个建议。希望各书店能本为群众服务的精神加以考虑。
    曹殿茂同志来信：希望设法解决药品供应
    近来市上盘尼西林、链霉素、磺?片等药品价格，日趋上涨，如盘尼西林由一万三千五百元涨至四万元。为此，除建议政府应予投机商人以有效制裁外，另应敦促能制造这些药品的机关大量制造（如天坛防疫处即能制造盘尼西林）以应民需，并可节省外汇。
    大同市总工会通讯组来信：王庆荣改进了反射炉
    新中国的工人，有着旺盛的工作热情和无限的创造力，他们时时刻刻都有新的成绩创造出来。公营大同市化学厂工人王庆荣，过去是按照天津学来的老法子修造反射炉的，每月要烧坏夹板铁四十多块。王庆荣经一个多月的研究，他发现烧大同煤炉板上不存煤灰，和烧开滦煤不同。于是，在修下一个炉时，他把炉板加厚，象鼻铁的坡度加大。这样，就不再烧坏夹板铁了。每月可较前节省三千斤小米的损耗。
    私营九如铁工厂元车组，工人岳同正，改进了卡盘，效率提高四倍。元车组过去镟里套，每上一次卡盘就要十分钟，平均一点钟只能镟三个。该组工人岳同正，经过三天时间的钻研，把旧的活卡盘改成新的固定卡盘。工作时只须紧一紧螺丝，就把卡盘按好了。新的固定卡盘使用方便，缩短了停车时间，每点钟可镟十五个里套，效率提高了四倍。他因此受到了市政府的表扬和厂方的物质奖励。
    山西张恩魁等同志来信：农村合作社组织打铁炉
    黎城县香炉峧、霍家窑、东崖底等八个村合作社，入冬以来，共组织了打铁炉十三盘，为农民修打了农具一千六百三十六件，以迎接春耕大生产。这些农具物美价廉，很受农民欢迎，大家纷纷称颂合作社能给群众谋利益。
    刘德荣同志来信：盂县农民生产恢复添买牲口
    山西盂县惨遭日寇破坏的梁家寨村，生产已逐渐恢复。该村在一九四○年曾有七十头耕畜，被日寇抢劫一光。解放后，群众得以安心生产，又经过去年的丰收，农民有了余粮，今冬在村干部的带动下，大家凑集了资金和自织的土布等物资，赴外区购回耕牛十六头。群众看到买的牛很好，价格也很合算，纷纷要求再买。当地人民银行支行予以贷款扶助，准备第二次再购十头。
    辽东凤城县王芳明来信：两种饲养方法的不同结果
    扈家村群众普遍存在着这样的思想：“牲口长毛，是天生在外边的东西，用不着夹圈防寒。”因此对牲口饲养很不关心。全村的牲口圈大多是用四根柱子支个棚，不遮风，不挡雪；饲养也不经心，不注意加料饮水。牲口不是死掉，就是瘦了。如七闾教思章，养了三、四条牛，每天却只顾别的活，不经心上料。虽然搞了一年副业，却死掉了一条大牛。武装委员李振清也因为不经心饲养，活活地冻死了一条驴。
    可是刘家村，事情完全不同了。他们接受了去年牲畜患南风素的教训，村干部经常对农民进行牲畜饲养、管理的教育，群众对饲养、管理牲畜，都有了认识。入冬后，就开始加草加料，修理牲口圈。很经心地饲养自己的牲口。第一闾五十八户中有四十八户养牲口，今年都有圈有棚，并把圈的四周用柴草结起不透风的围子，中间做一个小门，牲口受不着一点凉。因为大家注意饲草、加料、挑清水饮牲口，所以，今年家家牲口都腰满身圆。
