　　New Year in the Capital
　　Jin Feng
　　The people of the capital celebrated the first New Year of the latter half of the 20th century—the century of the people's victory—with solemn and victorious hearts.
　　The New Year began with auspicious snowfall, and the five-star national flags fluttered in the wind amidst the white snow. The evergreen pines and cypresses on the archways of various government offices, organizations, factories, and schools were particularly endearing. The streetcars were crowded with people dressed in new clothes. The movie theaters showing "Liberated China" and the theaters featuring performances by renowned actor Mei Lanfang were sold out of tickets the day before.
　　The year 1950 had already brought a stable and happy life to the people of Beijing. On the eve of the New Year, shops, silk and fabric stores, department stores, cooperatives, and cotton yarn companies were crowded with housewives shopping for New Year's goods, most of whom were families of working people. The Beijing Machine General Factory's cooperative prepared wine, oranges, and white flour for the New Year. Cloth and three thousand oranges were sold out in a few hours. For three whole days, the cooperative was packed with workers and their families buying things. Liu Chengpei, an old worker at the factory, bought a bolt of blue cloth and made new clothes for every child in his family. He made himself a leather overcoat. During the New Year, he and his children happily participated in the factory's New Year's celebration, wearing their new clothes. He told everyone he met, "In previous years, I couldn't even pay off my debts during the New Year, but this year, I bought a whole bolt of cloth." He earnestly told the young workers participating in the military cadre school, "You do a good job in national defense, and we'll do a good job in production to protect our good life!"
　　Tens of thousands of young workers and students in Beijing have responded to the call of the motherland and joined the military cadre schools. On New Year's Eve or New Year's Day, factories, schools, and government offices in Beijing held celebrations or evening parties, while also sending off this group of patriotic youth who are about to embark on the glorious post of national defense construction. On New Year's Eve, 40,000 workers and their families in Beijing held a grand New Year's celebration and garden party at the Laboring People's Cultural Palace. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the People's Art Theater jointly held a send-off meeting for Beijing's young workers joining the military cadre school. Liu Laifu, vice chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, enthusiastically encouraged and praised the workers participating in the military cadre school, and urged them, as well as all the workers: "We will never allow American imperialism to invade an inch of our land!" The workers participating in the military cadre school made strong vows to ensure their responsibility to the motherland. Various factories held separate get-together celebrations.
　　Every school was filled with joy. The enthusiastic celebration of the New Year was expressed in various forms in different schools, but the love of the teachers and students for the great motherland and Chairman Mao was the same. Yenching University held a "group greeting" on New Year's Eve, first offering New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao. Fu Jen University performed "Newborn Fu Jen" at the celebration evening, depicting the happiness of Fu Jen University breaking away from imperialist influence and becoming a university of the people. All the students of Jiaotong University's Beijing branch wrote to Chairman Mao to pay their respects and wished him a Happy New Year, shouting "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Huang Shuxian and other students from the Normal University who participated in the military cadre school wrote to Chairman Mao during the New Year's celebration, declaring "We will complete the tasks given to us by the motherland with the spirit of not hesitating to sacrifice our lives and the belief of eternal victory."
　　While celebrating the New Year, the people of the capital looked to the future with greater confidence. The workers of Beijing firmly remember: In 1951, we must take practical actions to improve production and consolidate national defense. Liang Sicheng, a professor at Tsinghua University, wrote an article celebrating the victory of 1950, he wrote: "Let us encourage each other to study harder next year, improve our political and professional levels, and strive to be meritorious servants of the people. Let us wish each other a complete victory in resisting America and aiding Korea, driving the American bandits down the Tsushima Strait, so that we can devote ourselves to peaceful construction with all our strength. Finally, let us congratulate the greatest professor in all of China—Chairman Mao—on his continued good health, leading us—his elementary school students—to study, leading us forward!"

　　首都的新年
    金凤
    首都人民以庄严、胜利的心情，欢度二十世纪——人民胜利的世纪的下半世纪的第一个新年。
    元旦瑞雪初降，满城五星国旗在皑皑白雪中迎风飘扬；映衬着各机关、团体、工厂、学校牌坊上的苍松翠柏，显得分外可爱。电车上挤满了身着新衣的人们。入夜，各剧院全部客满。上演“解放了的中国”名片的影院以及名演员梅兰芳演出的剧院，戏票早在先一天就售完了。
    一九五○年已给北京人民带来安定、幸福的生活。新年前夕，各商店、绸布庄、百货公司、合作社及花纱布公司挤满置办年货的家庭主妇，其中大部分是劳动人民的家属。北京机器总厂合作社在新年准备了酒、橘子、白面。布匹和三千个橘子，几小时内就卖光了。整整三天，合作社始终挤满着买东西的工人和家属。该厂老工人刘澄沛买了一匹蓝布，全家每个孩子都做了新衣服。他自己做了一件皮大衣。过年时他和孩子都穿着新衣服快快活活参加了工厂的新年联欢会。他见人就说：“往年过年连债都还不清，今年咱买布就买了一匹。”他恳切地告诉参加军事干部学校的青年工人：“你们好好做国防工作，咱们好好生产，来保卫咱们好日子！”
    北京市已有成万的青年工人、学生响应祖国号召，参加了军事干校。北京各工厂、学校、机关在除夕或元旦纷纷举行庆祝大会或晚会，同时欢送着这批将要踏上光荣的国防建设岗位的爱国青年。除夕，北京市四万工人及家属在劳动人民文化宫举行盛大的新年联欢游园大会。北京市总工会、市文联及人民艺术剧院三单位同时举行欢送北京市青工参加军事干校大会。市总工会副主席刘莱夫热情地鼓励着和称赞着参加军事干校的工人，叮嘱着他们，也叮嘱着所有的工人们：“我们决不让美帝国主义侵犯我们一寸土地！”参加军事干校的工人以有力的誓言保证他们对于祖国的责任。各工厂则分别举行着联欢大会。
    每个学校洋溢着喜气。庆祝新年的热烈情况在各校虽用着各种不同的形式表现着，但各校师生热爱伟大祖国与毛主席的心是同样的。燕京大学在除夕晚上举行“团拜”，首先向毛主席拜年。辅仁大学在庆祝晚会上演出“新生辅仁”，描绘着辅仁大学脱离帝国主义影响成为人民的大学的幸福。高呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”交大京院全体学生上书毛主席拜年致敬。师大参加军事干校的学生黄淑贤等，在庆祝元旦时上书毛主席，宣誓“将怀着不惜牺牲生命的精神和永远胜利的信念来完成祖国给予的任务。”
    在欢庆新年的同时，首都人民以更大的信心瞻望未来。北京市工人都牢牢记着：一九五一年，我们一定以实际行动提高生产，巩固国防。清华大学教授梁思成撰文庆祝一九五○年的胜利，他写道：“让我们互相勉励明年更加努力学习，提高自己的政治水平和业务水平，争取做人民的功臣。让我们互祝抗美援朝的彻底胜利，把美国强盗赶下对马海峡，好让我们能以全力从事和平建设。最后，让我们一齐祝贺全中国最伟大的教授——毛主席身体永远健康，领导着我们——他的小学生们——学习，领导着我们前进！”
