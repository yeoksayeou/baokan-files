　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country movement is unfolding among people of various ethnic minorities across the country.

　　More than 3,000 Hui people in Zhengzhou held a grand rally on December 24th of last year to oppose American aggression. Li Jiarong, chairman of the Zhengzhou Hui People's United Association, called on Hui children to apply for military cadre schools to study hard, increase production, and strengthen the country's defense and economic strength to oppose the aggression of American imperialism. After the meeting, a demonstration parade was held.

　　More than 200 representatives of the Hui people from all walks of life in Jinan City and 150 representatives of various ethnic groups such as the Yi, Hui, and Mosuo people from Xichang Prefecture in Xikang Province held separate meetings on December 21st of last year to discuss the issue of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending the country. At the symposium of various ethnic groups in Xichang Prefecture, the Yi representatives accused the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops of using weapons supplied by American imperialism to massacre Yi compatriots living in Yuexi and Puxiong counties between 1945 and 1946, pointing out that this proves that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Yi people. In addition, more than 1,000 Tibetan people in Ba'an City, a major town in central Xikang Province, held a Resist America, Aid Korea rally on New Year's Day, and held a torchlight demonstration parade in the evening, which did not disperse until late at night. Tibetan people in Songpan County, Sichuan Province, convened meetings of Tusi (local officials) and Laomin (intellectuals among the Tibetan people) to formulate patriotic covenants. The Yi people in Hedi Village, Kunming County, Yunnan Province, also used unparalleled hatred to accuse American imperialism of its bestial atrocities in the village from 1938 to 1944.

　　各地少数民族人民展开抗美援朝运动
    【新华社八日讯】抗美援朝保家卫国运动正在各地少数民族人民中展开。
    郑州市的三千余名回族人民于去年十二月二十四日举行了反对美国侵略盛大集会。该市回民联合会主席李家荣在会上号召回民子弟投考军事干部学校学习，努力生产，加强祖国的国防力量和经济力量，来反对美帝国主义的侵略。会后，并举行示威游行。
    济南市各界各行业的回族代表二百余人及西康省西昌专区彝族、回族、摩些等各民族的代表一百五十余人曾分别于去年十二月二十一日集会，座谈抗美援朝保家卫国问题。彝族代表在西昌区各民族座谈会上，控诉蒋匪军在一九四五到一九四六年间，拿着美帝国主义供给的武器，屠杀聚居在越巂、普雄两县彝胞的罪行，指出这证明美帝国主义是彝族人民的死敌。此外，西康省中部重镇巴安城藏族人民一千余人，于元旦举行抗美援朝大会，晚上举行了火炬示威游行，游行队伍至深夜始散。川西松潘县藏族人民曾召开土官、老民（藏族人民中的知识分子）会议，订出爱国公约。云南昆明县河底大村的彝族人民也以无比的愤恨，控诉了美帝国主义自一九三八年到一九四四年间，在该村的兽性暴行。
