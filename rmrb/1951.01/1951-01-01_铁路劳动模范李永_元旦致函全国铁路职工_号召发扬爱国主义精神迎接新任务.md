Railway Labor Model Li Yong
    New Year's Greetings to National Railway Workers
    Calling for the Promotion of Patriotism to Meet New Tasks

    [Reported by this newspaper] Li Yong, formerly the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive and now working at the All-China Railway Trade Union, wrote a special letter to railway workers across the country on New Year's Day, 1951, calling on everyone to further promote the spirit of patriotism and bravely meet the national railway transportation tasks of 1951. The original letter is as follows:

Comrades of the National Railway Workers:
    Due to work needs, at the end of 1950, I was transferred to work at the All-China Railway Trade Union. Today is New Year's Day of 1951. Taking this opportunity, I would like to extend my New Year's greetings to you all and wish you good health!
    In 1950, our railway work achieved great results, completing the national railway transportation task ahead of schedule. Minister Teng, in the "Telephone Conference" on December 20th last year, summarized the work of 1950 and told us that "the national loading plan was completed ahead of schedule on December 10th" and "the planned number of domestic passengers was completed ahead of schedule on December 2nd." This is a great喜事joyful event and worth celebrating. The achievement of these results is mainly due to Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the active efforts of the national railway workers, demonstrating the great strength of the working class's love for the motherland. Minister Teng also told us that this year's tasks are even heavier than last year, and we must increase revenue for the country. It is required to further shorten turnaround and dwell times. It is required to strive to persuade cargo owners with the lessons of 1950 and strive for balanced transportation. It is required to increase speed and eliminate accidents. It is required to focus on implementing economic accounting, gain experience, and implement precise planning, calculate costs, and strictly implement budget estimates and final accounts, in order to lay the foundation for striving to implement economic accounting within each railway administration in 1952. Comrades of the National Railway Workers: We should immediately respond to this call, and with the attitude of masters, continue to consolidate, improve, and advance on the basis of the victory in 1950! Carry out the patriotic production competition to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country more deeply and meticulously in all departments, in order to meet the transportation tasks assigned to the railway by the state in 1951; support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to completely eliminate the invading US imperialist bandit army in Korea, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and defend the security of the motherland and world peace.
    With New Year's greetings,
                                        Li Yong
                                January 1, 1951

　　铁路劳动模范李永
    元旦致函全国铁路职工         
    号召发扬爱国主义精神迎接新任务
    【本报讯】原为毛泽东号机车司机长，现已到中国铁路工会全国委员会担任工作的劳模李永，在一九五一年元旦特向全国铁路职工写信，号召大家更加发扬爱国主义的精神，勇敢迎接一九五一年的全国铁路运输任务。原信如下：全国铁路职工同志们：
    因为工作的需要，在一九五○年年底，我已调到中国铁路工会全国委员会工作。今天是一九五一年的新年，趁此机会，我特地在这里向你们拜年，并祝你们身体健康！
    一九五○年我们铁路工作是有很大成绩，提前完成了全国铁路运输任务。滕部长在去年十二月二十日“电话会议”上，总结一九五○年工作时，告诉我们“全国装车计划于十二月十日提前完成”，“关内旅客人数计划于十二月二日提前完成”。这是一桩大喜事，是值得庆祝的。这些成绩的获得，主要是由于毛主席英明领导，及全国铁路职工同志的积极努力，表现了高度的工人阶级热爱祖国的伟大力量。滕部长又告诉我们，今年的任务比去年还重，要给国家更多的增加收入。要求进一步缩短中转时间和停留时间。要求努力以一九五○年的教训说服货主，争取平衡运输。要求提高速度，消灭事故。要求重点实行经济核算，取得经验，并实行精密计划，计算成本，严格预决算，以打下争取一九五二年各管理局内实行经济核算的基础。全国铁路职工同志们：我们应当立即起来响应这个号召，以主人翁的姿态，在一九五○年胜利的基础上，继续巩固、提高、前进！在各个部门更深入细致地开展抗美援朝保家卫国爱国主义生产竞赛，以迎接一九五一年国家交给铁路的运输任务；支援中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军彻底消灭侵朝美帝匪军，坚决解放台湾，保卫祖国安全与世界和平。    致以新年的敬礼
                                      李永
                                一九五一年一月一日
