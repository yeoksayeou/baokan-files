　　Hebei Baoding Special District: Various Localities Prepare for Loan Seed Distribution in Advance This Year
    To the Editor:
    Last spring, the seven disaster-stricken counties of Anxin, Gaoyang, Xiongxian, Rongcheng, Zhuoxian, Qingyuan, and Xincheng in the Baoding Special District were allocated 600,000 jin of early-maturing crop seeds by the Provincial Government's economic meeting through loans from the Baoding People's Bank. At that time, because the arrangement for the loan distribution work was made relatively late, and the task was extremely urgent (as it concerned the livelihoods of millions of disaster victims), the banks in each county hurriedly sent stronger cadres to various places to purchase early-maturing crop seeds. Although it did not delay the planting for the disaster victims, the purchased seeds were expensive. Adding the transportation costs, one jin of barley seed was equivalent to one jin of millet (generally, one jin of millet could be exchanged for more than two jin of barley), which caused significant losses for both the state bank and the farmers. At the same time, due to the urgency of the time, each county more or less experienced some deviations in lending for unintended purposes. This year, the banks in each county have learned from the lessons of the spring loan seed distribution in the disaster areas last year. They are now mobilizing all agricultural loan cadres to actively prepare high-quality early-maturing crop seeds with a high sense of responsibility. According to incomplete statistics, the Gaoyang branch has prepared more than 150,000 jin of "79" spring wheat and awned barley seeds; the Anxin Bank has prepared more than 310,000 jin of awned barley seeds; the Qingyuan Bank has prepared more than 60,000 jin of awned barley and pea seeds; the Rongcheng Bank has prepared more than 50,000 jin of awned barley (including 20,000 jin in Xushui); and the Xiongxian branch has prepared more than 30,000 jin of awned barley, peas, and other seeds. The Anxin Bank has also signed a purchase contract with the local grain company for 200,000 jin of seeds. It is understood that the germination rate of the general seed quality is still good. This batch of seeds is now being transported to the disaster-stricken villages, and it is expected that all of them can be loaned to the disaster-stricken households before the end of the lunar year, ensuring that the planting time is not missed.

　　河北保定专区各地
    今年提前进行贷种准备编辑同志：
    保定专区安新、高阳、雄县、容城、涿县、清苑、新城等七个受灾县份，在去年春天经省府经济会议决定由保定人民银行贷出早熟作物种籽六十万斤。当时因放贷工作布置的较晚，而任务则刻不容缓（这是关系千百万灾民的生活问题），各县银行都急忙地派出了较强干部到各处收购早熟作物种籽，虽然没有耽误灾民播种，但所收购的种籽则价格高昂，加上运费，一斤大麦种要合一斤小米（一般的一斤小米可换二斤多大麦），使国家银行和农民都吃亏很大。同时因时间紧迫，各县都或多或少的发生了一些贷非所用的偏向。今年各县银行接受了去年春季灾区贷种教训，现正动员所有农贷干部以高度负责精神，积极准备早熟作物的优良种籽。据不完全的统计，高阳支行已备妥“七九”春麦和芒大麦种籽十五万多斤；安新银行已备妥芒大麦种籽三十一万多斤；清苑银行已备妥芒大麦、豌豆种籽六万多斤；容城银行已备妥芒大麦五万多斤（徐水二万斤在内）；雄县支行已备妥芒大麦、豌豆等种籽三万多斤。安新银行并与当地粮食公司订立二十万斤种籽的代购合同。据了解一般的种籽质量发芽率都还好。现正将这批种籽运往各受灾区村，预计在旧历年底，可全部贷到各灾户，保证不误播种时间。
