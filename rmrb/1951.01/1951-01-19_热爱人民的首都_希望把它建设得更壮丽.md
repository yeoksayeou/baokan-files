Loving the People's Capital
Hoping to Build It More Magnificently

To the Editor:

I have a few suggestions, please forward them to the relevant departments:

　　1. The lighting at the Beijing Railway Station is too dim, especially on the platforms. Beijing is an ancient capital of thousands of years and now the capital of the people. The Beijing Railway Station is a place used by the masses of people, and it is the first place that people from other places see when they arrive in Beijing. The dim lighting here gives people an unpleasant feeling. I suggest strengthening the lighting inside and outside the station, at least when trains arrive and depart.

　　2. The Qianmen Gate Tower is one of the landmarks of Beijing. It can still be seen on moonlit nights, but it is invisible on dark nights. It would be good to add neon light outlines. If there are concerns about destroying its original style, other lighting methods can also be used to display it.

　　3. The Tiananmen pattern is used on the national emblem, which is of great significance. Previously, I saw a national emblem hanging on Tiananmen, illuminated by a single light, which seemed insufficiently grand. China is liberated, the people have turned themselves over, and darkness has become the past. This should be symbolized on Tiananmen. Chairman Mao's portrait needs special lighting even more, making it a place that never sleeps, comparable to the red star on the clock tower of the Moscow Kremlin, so that people know that Beijing and Moscow have become the eyes of all mankind, and they will lead people to a happy and bright path, never to lose their way again. This not only has political significance, but also enhances the beauty of the capital's night scene.

　　4. Safety facilities signs and traffic lights should be added to the grass between the tram tracks and pedestrian crossing areas on East Chang'an Street to draw the attention of vehicles and make them slow down to ensure pedestrian safety.

　　5. The newly built swimming pool in Shichahai should also pay attention to the lighting problem so that it can be used at night. There should be lights on the edges and at the bottom of the pool.

　　6. The "Defend Peace" trams in Beijing are not as beautiful as the ZIS-type trams in Tianjin. The front end is too narrow and the wheels are exposed. I hope that the same departments in various places can all have connections, exchange experiences, learn from each other's strengths, and overcome weaknesses, instead of just groping independently. Good things should be promoted throughout the country.

　　I am an amateur in all the above-mentioned points, only out of love for the motherland and concern for the people's capital. Perhaps I have said too much, please consider it!

### 热爱人民的首都  希望把它建设得更壮丽

专栏：读者来信

　　热爱人民的首都
    希望把它建设得更壮丽编辑同志：
    我有几点意见，请代转有关方面：
    一、北京车站灯光太暗，尤以月台为甚。北京为千年古都，今为人民首都；北京车站为人民群众利用之所，是外地到北京的人首先看到的地方，这里灯光过于暗淡，予人以不快之感。我建议加强车站内外照明，最低亦应在车到车开时如此。
    二、前门楼为北京标志之一，月夜还可看出，暗夜则一无所见。能加以霓虹灯轮廓就好了。如恐破坏其故有之风格，也可以其他照明方法显示之。
    三、天安门图案用在国徽上，意义重大。前见天安门上挂一国徽，以一灯照之，显得不够气派。中国解放，人民翻身，黑暗已成过去，应该在天安门上象征出来。毛主席像更须特别照明，使为不夜之所，与莫斯科克里姆林宫钟楼之红星媲美，使知北京莫斯科已成为全人类的眼睛，她将带着人们走向幸福光明之途，再不会迷失道路。这不但有政治意义，并能增加首都夜景之美。
    四、东长安街电车道间之草地及行人通过区，应加安全设施标志及信号灯，以引起行车之注意，使之慢行，以保行人安全。
    五、什刹海新筑游泳池，也希注意考虑照明问题，以便夜间利用。边沿水底都要有灯才好。
    六、北京电车之保卫和平号，不如天津吉斯式者为美。前端太窄，下露车轮，希各地同样部门，全能有所连系，交流经验，取长补短，不要只是个个独自摸索，好的应推行全国。
    本人对上提各点皆为门外汉，只因对祖国的热爱，对人民的首都关心，也许未免就说的太多了，请您考虑一下吧！
                                            天津中央电工北厂  邵耀宗
    编者按：读者邵耀宗对国家建设积极建议的精神是很好的。通过这些建议的一字一句，表现出了他对自己的伟大祖国的关怀和热爱。今特将其原信发表，并希有关部门对这些建议加以研究。
