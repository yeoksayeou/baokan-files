Several Questions Regarding Agricultural Tax Collection in New Areas
　　Zuo Chuntai

　　I. The agricultural tax rate in new areas is lower than in 1949. Why is it that in some areas, the amount collected in 1950 is no less than, or even exceeds, that of 1949?

　　The "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas," passed and promulgated by the Central People's Government Committee on September 5, 1950, stipulated a reduction in the agricultural tax rate (the proportion of national grain to total agricultural income was reduced from 17% in 1949 to 13% in 1950). However, in some areas, the amount collected was no less than, or even exceeded, that of 1949. The main reasons for this are:

　　1. The scope of burden has expanded: In 1949, due to excessive tax exemption thresholds, the number of taxpayers was often less than 90% of agricultural households. In 1950, it was stipulated that the burden scope should generally not be lower than 90% of agricultural households, and in some prosperous areas, it could exceed 90%. For example, in 13 base point townships in the Jinhua Special District of Zhejiang and Yiqiao Township in Hangzhou County, calculated according to the tax threshold stipulated in 1950, the burden scope for agricultural households could increase from 70-80% in 1949 to 90-93% in 1950. In the Jiaxing Special District and prosperous areas of southern Jiangsu, it could reach 95%.

　　2. Concealed land has decreased. For example, after consolidation in Zhejiang, the land area generally increased by 10-15% compared to 1949. Hangzhou County increased by 21% compared to 1949, with some individual cases increasing by more than 100%. Statistics from 55 villages in eight counties in southern Anhui showed an increase of 38.5%. Although land in southern Jiangsu had been consolidated four times, it proved to be incomplete in 1950. The result of the 1950 consolidation was an average increase of 3%. At the same time, the old tax system was used in 1949, estimating that unproductive land accounted for about 20%, but after consolidation in 1950, it only accounted for 8%.

　　3. The authenticity of yield has improved. For example, the assessed yield in Shandong was about 13% higher than in 1949. In Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, most areas were closer to the actual yield than in 1949, except for some areas where it was too low.

　　4. The proportion of leased land in Jiangnan (including ancestral halls, temple lands, etc.) is very large. To facilitate the collection of agricultural tax, East China and Central South stipulated in the implementation rules regarding the burden of tenancy: all land that cannot be registered under a household shall be taxed at 40% of its rent (the same tax rate as stipulated in Article 13 of the regulations for lessors of ancestral halls, temple lands, etc., that cannot be calculated based on the agricultural population). In some areas, leased land accounts for about 50% or even 60% of all cultivated land. In these areas, the taxable amount of leased land alone can reach 40-50% of the task.

　　5. With relatively complete and unified regulations, and the correct method of "consolidating land, investigating and determining yield, registering households, and calculating tax according to the rate," the blindness of averaging tasks based on yield was overcome, correcting both the tendency of excessive levies and heavy burdens, and preventing wealthy villages and households from evading the tax they should pay, thereby avoiding the tendency of being too lenient. For example, in six administrative villages in Yiqiao Township, Hangzhou County, the land in Villages 1 and 3 was scattered, and the burden in 1950 was reduced by 14-38% compared to 1949. The land in Villages 5 and 6 was concentrated, and it increased by 10-20% compared to 1949. The average tax rate in Village 6 reached 31%. This is the result of implementing a reasonable burden and correcting the uneven burdens of 1949 in 1950.

　　On September 6, 1950, after the Central People's Government announced the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas," this newspaper published an editorial entitled "Strive to Correctly Implement the Agricultural Tax System in Newly Liberated Areas." The editorial pointed out: "After the agricultural tax rate is reduced, farmers will have the conditions to recuperate and develop, while the country can still guarantee roughly the same total agricultural tax revenue as last year." Facts prove that this estimate is correct. Recently, due to the resistance against the U.S. and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and to strengthen national defense, it will be necessary to increase the collection of public grain to ensure a balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure.

　　II. Is it a violation of policy to exceed the task by calculating the tax according to the regulations and rate?

　　After the rectification campaign in 1950, cadres' policy awareness has been generally strengthened. However, when the tax is calculated according to the regulations and rate, exceeding the task, the question arises: "Is it a violation of policy to exceed the task by calculating the tax according to the regulations and rate?" Some are even passively waiting for inspection for fear of being checked. This is obviously a statement that opposes "policy" and "regulations." In fact, the regulations are a concrete manifestation of the policy. Handling affairs according to the regulations is to correctly implement the agricultural tax policy. The phenomenon that the tax calculated according to the rate exceeds or falls short of the originally assigned task due to improper task allocation is not considered a violation of policy. On the contrary, only this number calculated according to the tax rate truly conforms to the policy.

　　Some people say, did the yield in 1950 get set too high due to the good harvest, violating the principle of using the normal annual yield of the land as the standard? In fact, according to the autumn tax collection summary of 13 base point townships in the Jinhua Special District of Zhejiang: "The determined yield mostly did not reach the standard of normal annual yield, such as the determined yield in Yangcun Township, Jiande, was lower." For example, the assessed yield in Shandong was 13% higher than in 1949, but the province's determined yield was still less than the actual yield investigated by the Agricultural Department.

　　Some people say that the average tax rate in Village 6 of Yiqiao Township, Hangzhou County, is as high as 31%, is the burden too heavy? First of all, we need to look at the proportion of the burden borne by each class to the total tax amount of the village. According to the investigation, the 14 landlords in the township (accounting for slightly more than 10% of the total number of households in the village) bear 58.95% of the total burden, ancestral land accounts for 3.46%, and rich peasants account for 1.81%. That is to say, landlords, ancestral land, and rich peasants alone bear more than 64% of the total amount of the village, middle peasants only bear 25.9%, poor peasants 8.98%, and other classes 1.01%. It is only natural that those with more land bear a heavier burden. Since the highest agricultural tax rate is 42%, including local surcharges is 48%, why can't a village with higher income (average agricultural income of 1,094 catties per person in the whole village) and concentrated land reach 31%, including local surcharges? For example, in Songjiang County, southern Jiangsu, there are three special households in Chengzhi Township with an annual income of more than 200,000 catties, which are taxed at a rate of 80%, including local surcharges. Therefore, the average tax rate in the township is naturally higher. But can it be said that the burden in the township is too heavy? The average tax rate in some poor villages in northern Jiangsu is only 8-9%, can it be said that the burden is too light? It is obviously incorrect to simply look at the level of the average tax rate in a certain place to determine the weight of the burden.

　　Some people say that from the absolute numbers, the amount collected in Yiqiao Township, Hangzhou County, is 70,000 catties more than in 1949, and the burden is heavier than in 1949. However, if we only compare the amount of burden in the whole township in 1949 and 1950, it is naturally heavier. If we further analyze, who are these increased numbers added to? First of all, it is added to those who concealed black land in 1949, among which landlords are the most important. According to statistics, the 29 landlords in the whole township alone collected 50,000 catties more than in 1949. Secondly, it is added to those with fewer people and more land. In 1949, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places adopted progressive rates based on households and acres, and these people benefited. More importantly, the income of farmers has greatly increased through measures such as rent reduction, increased production, seed loans, fertilizer loans, and the purchase of agricultural products (generally increasing production by 10-20% compared to 1949, with some individual cases reaching 50%). Therefore, the surplus of farmers after paying agricultural tax has also greatly increased compared to 1949, thereby increasing farmers' purchasing power. According to the investigation of Qiaosi District and Sandun District in Hangzhou County, after deducting food, seed retention, and public grain from the annual income, the annual surplus purchasing power per person in Qiaosi District is 348 catties of rice, and in Sandun District it is 321 catties, accounting for 30.7% of the total annual income of farmers. Therefore, the problem cannot be explained by simply comparing the amount of grain handed over in 1949 and the amount of grain handed over in 1950.

　　"The tax rate is the task." According to the provisions and tax rate of the agricultural tax regulations, and based on the local specific conditions (land barren, concentrated or scattered, high or low yield), calculate the burden of each township and household in a realistic manner. The amount that should be collected more should never be collected less, and the amount that should be assigned less should never be assigned more. This is the only way to correctly implement the policy and successfully complete the task. Some areas calculate the burden of each township and household according to the normal annual yield and the tax rate, which may exceed the task. Therefore, they consciously suppress the yield, thinking that it is enough to complete the originally assigned "task." It should be said that this cannot be considered as completing the task.

　　III. Several things to pay attention to

　　Precisely because most cadres have the idea that "there is no problem in completing the task," the result is a blind optimism and a careless attitude. For example, Jiangdu County in northern Jiangsu held an autumn tax collection meeting without adequate preparation. Of the 18 districts in the county, nine district chiefs did not attend the meeting. Some counties in the Jinhua Special District of Zhejiang also produced an impatient mood of "eager to achieve success and strive for the first," and in some areas of Yongkang, the grain tally was not prepared before mobilizing the masses to send grain, resulting in chaotic work, calculation errors, and causing dissatisfaction among the masses, resulting in more haste, less speed. Moreover, because the propaganda work failed to penetrate deeply, bandits and special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, such as saying, "The government will take all of the 150 catties or more," "This year's agricultural tax will be calculated at 40%." Experience has shown that collecting and depositing the payable tax amount is still an arduous struggle process. In this regard, we should first raise our vigilance, strengthen current affairs propaganda and policy education, pay close attention to the sabotage of bandits and special agents, and give them timely suppression, and combine the payment of public grain, enriching economic strength, and resisting the U.S. and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and combine the punishment of the chief culprits of bandits and special agents with the education of the masses. It is necessary to eliminate the style of commandism, and at the same time prevent the negative emotions of tailism.

　　Secondly, attention should be paid to disaster relief and social relief. Some individual cadres think that "this year's harvest is good, and there is no need for disaster relief." This is not right. In general areas, the harvest is good, but a few disaster-stricken areas still need to be taken care of in many ways. Although the income of general farmers has increased, it does not mean that the families of martyrs, soldiers, and revolutionary workers who lack labor and the elderly, weak, orphans, and widows are not having difficulties in life. On the contrary, the scope of relief should not be expanded without principle, causing losses to the country's fiscal revenue.

　　Thirdly, the issue of the arrears of 1949 should be correctly explained and handled. Many farmers in many areas have opinions on the unpaid arrears in 1949. They say, "Those who paid early suffered, those who paid late were scolded, and those who did not pay were spared," "It is better to pay late than to pay early, and it is better not to pay than to pay late." Therefore, it is necessary to break the worry that taking the lead in paying will suffer, and at the same time, do a good job in the aftermath of the autumn tax collection in 1950 to prevent the situation of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end. Finally, it is also necessary to unify leadership, concentrate efforts, persevere and never slacken, implement it from beginning to end. If you are eager to achieve success, it will make our collection work "fall short of success."

　　Doing a complete job of the autumn tax collection work in 1950 is of great significance for consolidating national finances, enriching national strength, and resisting the U.S. and aiding Korea. Let us continue to work hard to successfully complete this glorious task!

　　新区农业税征收中的几个问题
    左春台
  一、新区农业税率比一九四九年降低，为什么有的地区，
  在一九五○年的征收数额不少于甚至还超过于一九四九年？
    一九五○年九月五日中央人民政府委员会通过公布的《新解放区农业税暂行条例》，规定了降低农业税的税率（国家公粮占农业总收入，由一九四九年的百分之十七，降低至一九五○年的百分之十三），而在某些地区征收数额却不少于甚至超过于一九四九年，其主要原因是：
    一、负担面扩大了：一九四九年由于免征额太多，纳税户往往不及农业户口百分之九十。一九五○年的负担面，已规定一般不低于农业户百分之九十，某些富饶地区，则可超过百分之九十。如浙江金华专区十三个基点乡和杭县义桥乡，依一九五○年规定的起征点计算，农业户口的负担面，可由一九四九年的百分之七、八十，增至一九五○年的百分之九十——九十三；嘉兴专区和苏南的富饶地区，则可达到百分之九十五。
    二、瞒田减少了。如浙江经过整理，土地面积一般比一九四九年增加了百分之十至十五，杭县比一九四九年增加了百分之二十一，个别的增加了一倍以上；皖南八县五十五个村统计增加百分之三八。五；苏南土地虽经四次整理，但一九五○年证明仍不彻底。一九五○年整理的结果，平均增加了百分之三；同时一九四九年曾沿用旧赋元，估计无收益地约占百分之二十，在一九五○年进行整理后，却只占百分之八。
    三、产量的真实性提高了。如山东评定产量，比一九四九年提高了约百分之十三左右；浙江苏南除部分地区偏低外，大部比一九四九年接近实际了。
    四、江南租佃土地（包括祠堂、庙田等……）比重很大。为便于征收农业税，华东、中南曾在实施细则中规定，关于租佃负担是：凡不能归户的土地，皆按其租额的百分之四十计征（与条例第十三条不能按农业人口计算的祠堂、庙田等出租者的税率相同）。有的地区，租佃地约占全部耕地的百分之五十甚至六十，这些地区仅出租田的应征税额即可达任务的百分之四十至五十。
    五、有了比较完善的统一的条例，再有“整理土地，调查定产，归户造串，依率计征”的正确方法，便克服了按产量平均分配任务的盲目性，既纠正了层层加派、负担畸重的偏向，又使那些富庶的村户不能逃脱应交的税额，从而避免了畸轻的偏向。如杭县义桥乡六个行政村中，一、三村土地分散，一九五○年负担比一九四九年减少百分之十四至三十八，五、六村土地集中，比一九四九年增加百分之十至二十，第六村全村平均税率达百分之三十一。这就是一九五○年贯彻合理负担，纠正一九四九年畸轻畸重的结果。
    一九五○年九月六日，本报在中央人民政府公布《新解放区农业税暂行条例》后，曾发表“为正确执行新解放区农业税制而奋斗”的社论。社论中曾指出：“在农业税率降低之后，农民得到了休养生息的条件而国家仍能保证大致相同于去年的农业税总收入”。事实证明：这个估计是正确的。最近由于抗美援朝，保家卫国，加强国防力量，公粮将有必要增收一些，以保证平衡财政收支。
  二、按条例依率计征超过任务是否算违犯政策？
    一九五○年整风以后，干部的政策观念普遍加强了；但当按条例依率计征超过任务时，便发生了这样的问题：“按条例依率计征，超过任务，是否违犯政策呢？”甚至有的怕受检查而消极等待。这显然是将“政策”和“条例”对立起来的说法。其实条例是政策的具体化，按条例办事，就是正确执行农业税政策，其因任务分配不当，致依率计征后，较原分配任务超过或不及的现象都不算违犯政策。相反的，只有这种按税率来计算应征的数字，才真是符合于政策的。
    有人说，一九五○年是否因丰收把产量定高，违背了按土地常年应产量为标准的原则呢？实际上，据浙江金华专区十三个基点乡的秋征总结上说：“定产多未达常年应产的标准，如建德杨村乡的定产便低些”。又如山东评定产量比一九四九年提高百分之十三，但全省定产仍少于农业厅调查的实产量。
    有人说，浙江杭县义桥第六村平均税率达百分之三十一，负担是否过重呢？首先，我们要看一下各阶层负担额占全村税额的比例。根据调查，该乡地主十四户（占全村总户数百分之十强），负担额占总负担百分之五八·九五，祠田占百分之三·四六，富农占百分之一·八一，就是说，仅地主、祠田、富农就负担了全村总额的百分之六十四以上，中农只负担百分之二五·九，贫农八·九八，其他阶层一·○一。土地多的负担重，这原是应有的现象。既然农业税的税率最高为百分之四十二，包括地方附加为百分之四十八，为什么收入较多（全村每人平均农业收入一、○九四斤）土地集中的村，包括地方附加，不可以达到百分之三十一呢？如苏南松江县城至乡全年收入在二十万斤以上的特殊户，包括地方附加在内得以百分之八十的税率计征的，就有三户，因此该乡平均税率自然更高些，但能否说该乡的负担过重呢？苏北有些贫瘠的乡村平均税率只达百分之八、九，能否说负担过轻呢？单纯从某地平均税率的高低来看负担的轻重，显然是不正确的。
    有人说，从绝对数字上看，象杭县义桥乡比一九四九年征收额多七万斤，负担是比一九四九年加重了。但是，如果单从全乡一九四九年和一九五○年的负担数额来作比较，自然是加重了；如果进一步分析，这些增加的数字，究竟加在谁的头上了？那末，首先是加在一九四九年瞒黑田的人身上，其中地主是最主要的。据统计，仅全乡二十九户地主便比一九四九年增收了五万斤。其次，是加在人少地多的人身上，一九四九年浙江、福建等地，按户按田亩累进，这些人沾了光，更重要的是，一年来经过减租、增产、贷种、贷肥、收购农产品等措施，农民的收入大大增加了（一般比一九四九年增产一成至二成，个别的达五成），因此农民缴纳农业税后的剩余也比一九四九年大大增加了，从而农民的购买力也提高了，根据杭县乔司区、三墩区的调查，全年收入减去吃粮、留种、公粮后，乔司区每人全年剩余的购买力是大米三四八斤，三墩区是三二一斤，占全年农民总收入的百分之三○·七。因此，单以一九四九年交粮数和一九五○年交粮数比较，是不能说明问题的。
    “税率就是任务”，按照农业税条例的规定和税率，根据当地具体情况（土地贫瘠、集中或分散、产量高低）实事求是地计算各乡各户负担，该多征的就绝不少征，该少征的就绝不多派，这样才算正确执行政策，圆满完成任务。某些地区照常年产量依率计征，可以超出任务，因此就有意识地压低产量，以为只要完成原来分配的“任务”就可以了，应该说，这是不能算完成任务的。
  三、应该注意的几件事
    正由于一般干部存在着“完成任务没问题”的思想结果便产生了盲目乐观和麻痹大意的情绪。如苏北江都县准备不好就开秋征会议，全县十八个区，就有九个区长没有到会；浙江金华专区部分县份也曾产生“急于求成，争取第一”的急躁情绪，永康有的地区粮串没造好，就发动群众送粮，以致工作忙乱，计算错误，引起群众不满，结果欲速不达。且因宣传工作未能深入，匪特便乘机造谣破坏，如说，“一百五十斤以上的政府全拿走”，“今年农业税全按百分之四十计征”等等。经验证明，把应缴税额征收入库还是一个艰巨的斗争过程。在这方面，我们首先应提高警惕，加强时事宣传和政策教育，密切注意匪特的破坏，并给以及时的镇压，把缴纳公粮，充实经济力量和抗美援朝保家卫国结合起来，把惩办首恶匪特与教育群众结合起来。要肃清命令主义的作风，同时也要防止尾巴主义的消极情绪。
    其次，应重视灾情减免和社会减免。个别干部以为“今年丰收了，用不着灾情减免了”。这是不对的。一般地区丰收了，但有少数受灾的地区，仍需要多方照顾。一般农民的收入虽已增多，但并不等于缺乏劳力的烈士、军人、革命工作人员家属，老弱孤寡的生活都不困难了。相反的，也不应当无原则地扩大减免范围，使国家的财政收入受到损失。
    第三，应正确解释和处理一九四九年的尾欠问题。不少地区的农民，对一九四九年拖欠不交的有意见，他们说，“早交的受苦，迟交的挨骂，不交的便罢”，“早交不如迟交，迟交不如不交”，因此必须打破带头缴纳吃亏的顾虑，同时也要做好一九五○年秋征的善后工作，防止前松后紧。最后，还须统一领导，集中力量，不懈不怠，贯彻始终，若急于求成，反而会使我们的征收工作“功亏一篑”。
    把一九五○年的秋征工作完全作好，对于巩固国家财政、充实国家力量、抗美援朝，是有重大意义的。让我们继续努力，胜利完成这个光荣任务吧！
