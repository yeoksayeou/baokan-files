　　French Prisoners' Impressions of the Vietnam People's Army
　　[This Newspaper News] According to the "Vietnam News" of January 13th: Since December 25th of last year, the Vietnam People's Army has launched powerful offensives against French forces in the northeast of Vietnam and on the Phuc An front in Vinh Yen area of north-central Vietnam. As of December 29th, the Vietnam People's Army had captured Binh Lieu, advanced on Tien An and Mong Cai, forced the retreat of French forces from Chu Son and Khe Mai, routed the French 3rd Mobile Group, and eliminated ten French strongholds including Da Phuc, Thanh Ling, An Phuc, and Long Binh. On the Phuc An front alone, 1,800 French soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured. Among the captured French officers were Captain Picard, Captain Niapault, Captain Caland, Lieutenant Ferrinand, Lieutenant Bacha, Lieutenant Marame, and others.

　　Lieutenant Marame, a French officer captured in the battle of Than Lan (a mountain in Phuc An Province, North Vietnam) on December 28th, told reporters from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam about his capture: "I only arrived in Indochina a month ago. On December 27th, I learned that the strongholds of Huu Bang (in Vinh Yen Province) and Co Au (in Phuc An Province) had been eliminated. I was afraid that Than Lan would be next. So I took the necessary steps to strengthen the defensive capabilities of the stronghold I was defending. On the night of the 28th, I even received reports from scouts that there was no movement within ten kilometers of the stronghold. I still gave the order to prepare for battle. However, at midnight, the stronghold was suddenly bombarded by Vietnamese artillery. Before I could deploy, my soldiers were in complete disarray. I immediately rushed to the telegraph room to send a distress call. Before I could hear a reply, our building was hit by a Vietnamese mortar shell. The people I was with ran to the basement to take shelter. Outside, the Vietnam People's Army's machine guns continuously fired into the loopholes of our bunkers and destroyed our machine gun positions in the southern bunkers of the stronghold.

　　"At this time, I didn't know what to do. Mines and bombs exploded deafeningly, and attack horns sounded from all directions. Vietnamese soldiers climbed on top of the bunkers and threw grenades through the loopholes. The first shell hit the command post while I was there. The second shell wounded my leg, and the wounded soldiers next to me were crying and screaming. At this moment, the Vietnamese army rushed into the courtyard like a storm. I pulled out my revolver to fight, but before I could fire, three Vietnamese soldiers were already in front of me. I put down my revolver and raised my hands. What else could I do? I was captured. Five minutes later, I saw groups of soldiers from the basement also being taken prisoner. Piles and piles of North African and French soldiers' bodies lay on the ground. They were probably killed because they ran away like madmen at the beginning of the battle! When the Vietnamese army shouted, 'Lay down your arms and you will not be killed! Prisoners will be treated leniently!' the rest of the soldiers came out of the underground shelters. That's how the battle ended."

　　Lieutenant Marame concluded by sharing his reflections on the battle and his impressions of the Vietnam People's Army: "I think there are several characteristics that should be mentioned:

　　"First, the morale of the North African and French soldiers completely collapsed under the artillery bombardment of the Vietnam People's Army.

　　"Second, the artillery and machine gun fire of the Vietnam People's Army were very accurate. All the important locations of the stronghold were hit. Vietnamese machine gun bullets fiercely shot into the loopholes of the bunkers and shelters, preventing us from raising our heads.

　　"Third, the heroism of the Vietnam People's Army is unbelievably high. I personally saw them climb on top of the bunkers and throw grenades inside, while the artillery fire did not stop, and the mortars outside were bombarding the defense center of Than Lan.

　　"Fourth, the morale of the Vietnamese army is extremely high and their discipline is excellent. During this time walking with them, I had the opportunity to see that they have genuine strict discipline. I don't think the French army has ever had such good discipline.

　　"Fifth, the Vietnam People's Army is not only brave in battle and has extremely high morale, but also has excellent equipment. This is the first time I have engaged them in battle, and now I really know it. I don't think the French army can ever fight them.

　　"I just arrived in Indochina. After the Battle of Than Lan, my only hope is that the war of aggression against Vietnam will end as soon as possible, so that I can go home and live with my wife and three children."

### 法国俘虏眼中的越南人民军

　　法国俘虏眼中的越南人民军
    【本报讯】据一月十三日《越南新闻》讯：去年十二月二十五日起越南人民军在越南东北部及北越中部永安地区福安前线先后向法军发动强有力的进攻。截至十二月二十九日止，越南人民军攻占平辽，进迫仙安、芒街，逼退朱山、奚梅法军，击溃法军第三机动队，拔除多福、清凌、安福、龙平等法军据点十处。仅福安前线即毙伤俘法军一千八百人。被俘法军军官中计有法军官皮卡德上尉、尼亚保上尉、卡兰德上尉、费里南中尉、巴夏中尉、马拉梅中尉等多名。
    十二月二十八日在壁虎（Than Lan为北越福安省内一座山名）一役被俘的法军军官马拉梅中尉，对越南民主共和国的记者谈他的被俘经过说：“我一个月前才到印度支那来。十二月二十七日我就知道友平（HunBan在永安省）和古庵（Co au 在福安省）两据点被消灭了。我想到怕该轮到壁虎了。所以我就采取必要步骤来加强我防守的这个据点的防御力量。二十八日夜里，我还接到侦察兵的报告说据点周围十公里并未发现什么动静。我仍下命令准备接战。然而到夜半时，据点便突然遭到越南炮兵的轰击。我还没有来得及部署，我的士兵可就乱成一团了。我立刻冲到电讯室拍电呼救。回电还没有听到时，我们的房子就被越南臼炮炮弹所轰倒。我的同屋的人们都跑到地下室躲避去了。在外面呢，越南人民军的机枪连续射进我们碉堡的枪眼，并将我们在据点南部碉堡的机关枪阵地消灭了。
    “这时我还不能明白怎样做才对，地雷和炸弹震天价响起来了，四面八方一片进攻的号声。越南军队爬在碉堡顶上顺着枪眼往里面掷手榴弹。第一颗炮弹炸中司令部时，我正在那里。第二颗炮弹炸伤我的腿，旁边几个被炸伤的士兵哭叫得一塌糊涂。这时越南军队像一阵暴风似的冲到院子里了。我拔出了我的左轮准备拚战，但还不及开枪的时候，三个越南士兵已经跑到我的面前。我放下左轮，举起了双手，我还能作什么别的呢？我被俘了，五分钟后，我看见地下室的士兵一群一群地也作了俘虏。地上躺着一堆一堆的北非及法国士兵的尸体。可能因为他们战斗一开始就没命似的逃跑才被杀死的呢！当越南军队喊叫“缴枪不杀，优待俘虏！”时，其余的士兵也都从地下掩蔽部里走了出来，这样，战斗结束了。”
    马拉梅中尉最后并发表他对这次战斗的感想和他对越南人民军的印象说：“我认为有几个特点应该提一提：
    “第一，北非的和法国的士兵在越南人民军炮兵的轰击下士气完全垮台。
    “第二，越南人民军的炮火及机枪射击非常准确。据点的所有重要的处所均被击中。越南机关枪子弹凶猛的射进碉堡和掩蔽室的枪眼，打得我们抬不起头来。
    “第三，越南人民军的英雄主义是高得令人难以置信的，我曾亲眼看见他们爬上碉堡顶上往里面掷手榴弹，而那时炮火并未停歇，外面的臼炮正向壁虎的防卫中心轰击。
    “第四，越南军队士气极高及纪律又好。这次我和他们一起走，我有机会看到他们有着真正的严格的纪律。我认为法军从来就没有这样好的纪律。
    “第五，越南人民军不仅作战英勇，士气极高，而且装备很好。这是我第一次同他们接火，我才真的知道了。我认为法军永远不能和他们对敌。
    “我刚刚到印度支那来，在壁虎战役之后，我的唯一的希望就是侵越战争尽可能早日结束吧，这样我就可以回家和我的妻子以及三个孩子一起生活了。”
