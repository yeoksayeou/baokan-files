　　Against the US Imperialist Aggression Plan
    Western European People's Protest Movement Gains Momentum
    "Eisenhower Go Home!" Resounds Everywhere
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] The movement of the broad masses of people in Western European countries against the US aggression plan has reached a new climax with the arrival of warmonger Eisenhower.
    Eisenhower arrived in Paris on the 7th. Before his arrival, the French working people had already launched a massive protest movement. Because of this, even though there were 6,000 police on the streets to maintain strict guard when Eisenhower arrived in Paris, he had to take a detour, and many pre-arranged official welcomes had to be canceled. On January 9th, countless delegations of Parisians broke through layers of police blockades and held a full day of patriotic demonstrations. Employees of more than 1,000 enterprises in Paris and its suburbs, as well as faculty and students of the University of Paris, École Normale Supérieure, and other schools, also went on strike and boycotted classes to protest. Protest strikes and protest signatures were also held in other parts of France.
    In the Netherlands, the people of The Hague and Amsterdam protested Eisenhower's arrival on the 10th with large-scale demonstrations. Dutch Communist Party Chairman Wiegina publicly returned the US "Legion of Merit" awarded to him by Eisenhower himself in 1946 to the military attaché of the US Embassy, and wrote in a letter left for Eisenhower: "We refuse to fight with the Nazis under your leadership."
    The people of the Danish capital protested Eisenhower's arrival on the 11th by singing anti-Nazi resistance songs and shouting slogans to defend peace.
    The Political Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain issued a statement on the 13th stating that Eisenhower should know, "The British people will never accept the fate he is preparing for them." "All patriotic British citizens, trade union and cooperative movement members, veterans, mothers and young people demand: Eisenhower go home! Britain will not contribute a single soldier to the US war plan! No German rearmament! Negotiate with the Soviet Union immediately!" When Eisenhower arrived in London on the 13th, he encountered powerful demonstrations, so that the Labor authorities needed to "take special measures" to "protect" him.
    The news that "Eisenhower will go to Italy" sparked a wave of protests among the Italian people. Students, workers and soldiers in Rome held demonstrations. Strikes were held in Rome, Naples, Brescia and many central cities in the province of Emilia, and many mines in Sicily, to protest.
    The loud cry of "Eisenhower go home" has resounded throughout every corner of Western Europe with the arrival of this warmonger.

　　反对美帝国主义侵略计划
    西欧人民抗议运动声势浩大
    “艾森豪威尔滚回去！”的呼声响彻每个角落
    【新华社十五日讯】西欧各国广大人民反对美国侵略计划的运动，已随着战争贩子艾森豪威尔的抵达而达到了新的高潮。
    艾森豪威尔是在七日到达巴黎的。在他抵达以前，法国劳动人民已展开了声势浩大的抗议运动。因为这样，当艾森豪威尔到达巴黎时，街头虽有六千名警察严加戒备，他还是不得不绕道而行，而许多事先布置好的官方欢迎，也不得不取消。一月九日，巴黎人民的无数代表团，又冲破大批警察的重重封锁，举行了整整一天的爱国大示威。巴黎及近郊一千多个企业的职工和巴黎大学、高等师范等学校的教职员、学生，也纷纷罢工、罢教、罢课，以示抗议。在法国其他各地，也举行了抗议罢工和抗议签名。
    在荷兰，海牙和阿姆斯特丹的人民，以大示威来抗议艾森豪威尔十日的抵达。荷共主席魏吉纳当众把艾森豪威尔本人在一九四六年颁发给他的美国“军功勋章”退还给美国大使馆的武官，并在留给艾森豪威尔的信上写道：“我们拒绝在你领导下和纳粹一道去作战”。
    丹麦首都的人民在十一日高唱着反纳粹的抵抗运动歌，高呼着保卫和平的口号，抗议艾森豪威尔的到来。
    英国共产党政治委员会于十三日发表声明称：艾森豪威尔应该知道，“英国人民决不接受他正为他们准备的命运”。“一切爱国的英国公民、工会与合作社运动者、退伍军人、母亲与青年们都要求：艾森豪威尔滚回去！英国不为美国战争计划出一兵一卒！不准德国重新武装！马上与苏联谈判！”当艾森豪威尔于十三日抵达伦敦时，他又碰到了强大的示威游行，以致工党当局需要“采取特别措施”来“保护”他。
    “艾森豪威尔将赴意大利”的消息一发表，就激起了意大利人民的抗议怒潮。罗马的学生、工人和士兵纷纷举行示威，罗马、那不勒斯、布林西亚等城以及艾米利亚省的许多中心城市和西西里的许多矿场，都举行罢工以示抗议。
    “艾森豪威尔滚回去”的宏亮呼声，已随着这一战争贩子的到达而响彻了西欧的每一个角落。
