    Commemorative Study Materials for the 27th Anniversary of Lenin's Death (Continued from Yesterday)
    Hu Hua
            Regarding Sun Yat-sen and His Doctrines

In 1912, Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of Provisional President of the Republic of China and published an essay entitled "The Social Significance of the Chinese Revolution." Based on this material, Lenin wrote a commentary called "Democracy and Populism in China," making a brilliant and extremely important evaluation of Sun Yat-sen and his doctrines.

In this article, Lenin pointed out that this "provisional president of the Asian republic is a revolutionary democrat" (ibid., p. 25), praising him as "worthy of being a comrade of the great propagandists and great activists of France at the end of the 18th century." This democrat, in terms of his class nature, was the political representative of "the bourgeoisie who can represent true, militant, and thorough democracy" (ibid., p. 26), namely, "revolutionary bourgeois democrats" (ibid., p. 30).

Sun Yat-sen's democratic thought was concentrated in his political program, just as Lenin praised: "The program of Sun Yat-sen is permeated with militant, genuine democracy in every line" (ibid., p. 24). "Before us is a truly great ideology of a truly great people" (ibid., p. 25).

We know that in the Tongmenghui Manifesto of August 1905, Sun Yat-sen put forward the four major political programs of "expelling the Tartars, restoring China, establishing the Republic, and equalizing land rights." In the six party programs announced at the same time, "equalizing land rights" was clearly written as "advocating land nationalization." The presentation of this program truly demonstrated Sun Yat-sen's "noble spirit and heroic spirit." It was the earliest slogan regarding the general principles of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution (the Three Principles of the People: nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood). The presentation of these slogans told people that "the East has completely embarked on the path of the West, and hundreds of millions of new people will henceforth participate in the struggle for the ideals that the West has strived to achieve" (ibid., p. 26). The "ideals that the West has strived to achieve" mentioned by Lenin here refer to the democratic ideals that replaced national oppression and feudalism, the ideals realized by the French Revolution.

Lenin also pointed out that this democratic ideal in China was tinged with populist colors, and Sun Yat-sen was also a "subjective socialist." This was because: the era when China began the bourgeois democratic revolution in a more definite sense was already the era of imperialism (dying capitalism) and proletarian revolution in the world; at this time, "advanced Chinese people, all Chinese people, because of experiencing this upsurge (note: referring to the revolutionary upsurge), borrowed their ideas of liberation from Europe and America; but in Europe and America, the current issue is already the issue of liberation from the bourgeoisie, that is, socialism. Therefore, inevitably, there will be sympathy of Chinese democrats for socialism, their subjective socialism" (ibid., p. 27). We know that Sun Yat-sen was indeed enthusiastically sympathetic to socialism. He subjectively regarded the Principle of People's Livelihood—equalization of land rights—as socialism. At the same time, he also attempted to "prevent" capitalism. But in fact, the program of the Principle of People's Livelihood—equalization of land rights—reflected the desire of the vast number of small producers in China—peasants—to liberate themselves from feudal exploitation. It only demanded the abolition of the feudal land ownership system. This is what Lenin said: "From the subjective socialist thoughts and program of this Chinese democrat, in fact, what is obtained is... only a program for eliminating feudal exploitation" (ibid., p. 28). The revolution that implements such a program is precisely the bourgeois democratic revolution, not any socialist revolution. The objective result of the implementation of such a program is precisely to create prerequisites for the broad development of capitalism in China, not to "prevent capitalism." This is determined by China's specific historical conditions and cannot be changed by Chinese utopian socialists.

We know that the earliest Russian populists also subjectively dreamed of socialism, but objectively, they were precisely demanding the broad development of capitalism. Therefore, Lenin said that Sun Yat-sen "is so similar to the Russian populists that he has reached complete agreement in basic ideas and many individual statements" (ibid., p. 24). And "this theory, if examined from the viewpoint of doctrine, is the theory of the petty-bourgeois 'socialists'—reactionaries" (ibid., p. 28). Because this dream of opposing "capitalism" in agriculture violates the law of the forward development of social productive forces. It is a reflection of the narrow average thinking of small producers—peasants. From the perspective of social development, the nature of this utopian agricultural socialist thought is backward, regressive, and reactionary.

Finally, regarding Sun Yat-sen's doctrines, Lenin instructed us like this: "Finally, as the number of Shanghais increases in China, the Chinese proletariat will also grow. It will certainly establish this or that Chinese Social Democratic Labor Party, which, while criticizing Sun Yat-sen's petty-bourgeois utopia and reactionary views, will carefully select, protect, and develop the revolutionary-democratic core of his political program and land program" (ibid., p. 31).

The Chinese Communists, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, faithfully implemented Lenin's brilliant instructions. Comrade Mao Zedong used the theory of scientific socialism—Marxism-Leninism—to summarize the laws of modern Chinese society and revolutionary development, and formulated a complete set of programs and principles for the Chinese revolution, first of all the program and principles for the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. Among them, it absorbed, protected, and developed the best part of the legacy of Sun Yat-sen—this great revolutionary forerunner—and realized it.
            II. On China's New Democratic Revolution
            On "The Chinese Revolution is a Part of the World Revolution"
Lenin's theoretical work on China and the East after the First World War and the victory of the Russian October Revolution was mainly about the doctrine of national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies. The central idea of ​​Lenin's doctrine was to link the national liberation movement with the world proletarian socialist revolution, to regard the national liberation movement as a part of the world proletarian socialist revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on this idea of ​​Lenin and Stalin, clearly put forward the proposition that "the Chinese revolution is a part of the world revolution," and elaborated in detail on the theories of Lenin and Stalin. This section of this article will use Comrade Mao Zedong's title to introduce some of Lenin's theories on the national liberation movement.

First of all, regarding the situation of the world's national question, Lenin pointed out to the people of the world such a fact, that is: due to imperialist aggression and the imperialist war, the nations of the world have been divided into two categories: oppressor nations and oppressed nations. In July 1920, in his report to the Second Congress of the Communist International, Lenin said:

        "The basic outline of the world picture formed after the imperialist war is roughly like this. 1.25 billion oppressed colonial people—

        Countries like Persia, Turkey, and China that are being divided alive; some defeated countries that have been forced into colonial status. Nearly 250 million people in countries that have maintained their original status, but have fallen into economic dependence on the United States, because the war swept the entire world, and it does not allow a country to have true neutrality. Finally, at most 250 million people are in countries where, needless to say, only the upper echelons, only the capitalists, enjoy the benefits of dividing the world. A total of about 1.75 billion people, which is the entire population of the earth." (On the Intensification of Imperialist Oppression of Colonies and the Beginning of the National Liberation Movement in the East, ibid., p. 88)

Lenin's idea of ​​dividing the world's nations into oppressor nations and oppressed nations and calling on the oppressed nations to rise up aroused slander and jealousy from the international imperialist powers. Regarding this point, Sun Yat-sen, a great democrat of our country, once said:

      "The reason why the world powers slander Lenin is because he dared to say that the majority of nations in the world, 1.25 billion people, are oppressed by a minority of nations, 250 million people. Lenin not only said these words, but also advocated self-determination for the oppressed nations, and fought for the oppressed people in the world. The reason why the powers attack Lenin is to eliminate the prophets and seers among mankind, and seek safety for themselves, but now mankind has become aware that the rumors fabricated by the powers are false, so they are no longer deceived by them. This is the situation where the political thought of the world's nations has progressed to a bright position." (Lecture 4 on Nationalism)

In analyzing Lenin's aforementioned passage, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out:

        "This is the national question in the modern world. This is the question of the ferocious oppression and plunder of the world's colonies and semi-colonies by the imperialists (upper echelons, capitalists) of a few countries. The situation of this national question reflects the sharpening of the contradictions of world capitalism and the sharpening of the unbalanced development of capitalism in various countries in the era of imperialism. Under these circumstances, on the one hand, it cannot but arouse the sharp struggle between imperialist countries to compete for colonies; on the other hand, it cannot but give rise to the world-wide national liberation movement of all oppressed nations against imperialism and striving for liberation." (On Internationalism and Nationalism, Section 3)

Yes, this is the basis for the emergence of the national liberation movement. Due to the influence of the First World War and the victory of the Russian October Revolution, Lenin said that "the nations of the East are awakening and are taking practical actions. Each nation must solve the problem of the destiny of all mankind." (On the Awakening of the Nations of the East, Lenin, Stalin on China, p. 67)

Lenin taught us that in order to achieve complete victory, the liberation movement of these oppressed nations must unite with the proletariat and laboring masses of the whole world and become a part of the world proletarian socialist revolution in order to overthrow the rule of the common enemy—international imperialism. Lenin said:

        "The socialist revolution will not only be and mainly the struggle of the revolutionary proletariat in each country against its own bourgeoisie—no, this revolution will also be the struggle of all colonies and countries oppressed by imperialism, and all dependent countries against international imperialism." (On the Awakening of the Nations of the East, ibid., pp. 65-66)

Under Lenin's call, and under the influence of the October Revolution and the world revolutionary tide, the face of the Chinese revolution began to change with the "May Fourth Movement" in 1919 as an opportunity. The Chinese revolution became a part of the world proletarian socialist revolution.

In June 1920, in the "Draft Theses on National and Colonial Questions" prepared for the Second Congress of the Communist International, Lenin proposed that the Communist International and the Soviet Union must actively help the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries and the policies of the working class in these countries. Lenin wrote:

        "At present, we cannot be limited to merely acknowledging or declaring the approach of the workers of all nations, but must carry out a policy of realizing the closest alliance between all national and colonial liberation movements and Soviet Russia." (Ibid., p. 75)

        "All communists must help the bourgeois democratic liberation movement in these countries; those workers in the countries on which the backward nations are dependent in terms of colonies or finance have the most active obligation to assist first." (Ibid., p. 78)

Under the great internationalist policies of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet government automatically abolished all privileges in China and abolished all unequal treaties concluded between the Tsarist Russia era and the old Chinese government; these "acts of righteousness that the world has never had before" (as the Tianjin Yishi Bao at that time said) gave the people of all walks of life in China at that time infinite joy and encouragement. At this time, the Chinese working class also stepped onto the political stage based on its own historical conditions, and in 1921, with the help of the Communist International, it formed its own vanguard—the Communist Party of China, thereby leading the Chinese New Democratic Revolution.

At the same time, in the resolution of the above-mentioned Communist International Congress personally presided over by Lenin, it also "accurately stipulates the mutual relationship between the Communist International and the revolutionary movements in countries that are politically oppressed and where the capital (imperial) system dominates (such as China and India)." (Ibid., p. 81) That is, "The Communist International should maintain close contact with the revolutionary forces in countries that are currently politically and economically oppressed to overthrow imperialism." (Ibid., p. 82)

According to this policy, Malin, the secretary of the "National and Colonial Question Committee" of the Congress, was ordered to come to China in early 1921. At this time, based on the further development of capitalism in China, under the influence and promotion of the October Revolution and the "May Fourth" People's Movement, the Chinese bourgeoisie also became politically active again. Sun Yat-sen and the then Guangdong government welcomed and accepted the assistance of the Soviet Union and the Communist International and the CCP, reorganized the Kuomintang in 1924, and established the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers. It was precisely because of the above-mentioned policies and assistance of Lenin and Stalin that the vigorous upsurge and great development of the Chinese national liberation movement of 1925-27 took place. Sun Yat-sen's will to the Soviet Union when he was dying in March 1925 precisely expressed the sincere and selfless assistance and sincere gratitude of this generation of Chinese national democratic revolutionaries to the Soviet Union under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin.

In an article written to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the October Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese revolutionary struggle, which has always been isolated, has no longer felt isolated since the victory of the October Revolution. We have the assistance of the Communist Party and the working class all over the world." (Unite all revolutionary forces in the world to oppose imperialist aggression) The victory of the Chinese people's revolution today is precisely because the Chinese people's heroic struggle, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has obtained the assistance of revolutionary forces all over the world in various different ways; it is precisely the brilliant victory of Lenin's doctrine of linking the national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies with the world proletarian socialist revolution.
                                                          (To be continued)

　　学习列宁关于中国革命的学说
    纪念列宁逝世二十七周年的学习资料（续昨）

            关于孙中山及其主义
    一九一二年，孙中山就任中华民国临时大总统，发表了一篇名叫《中国革命的社会意义》的论文。列宁根据这一篇材料，写了一篇名叫《中国的民主主义与民粹主义》的评论，对孙中山及其主义做了天才的极端重要的评价。
    列宁在这篇文章里指出，这位“亚洲的共和国临时总统是革命的民主主义者”（同上书二十五页），称赞他“不愧为法国十八世纪末叶的伟大的宣传家和伟大的活动家的同志”。这位民主主义者就其阶级性说，则是“能够代表真实的、战斗的、彻底的民主主义的资产阶级”（同上书二十六页）的政治代表。也就是“革命资产阶级民主派”。（同上书三十页）
    孙中山的民主主义的思想，是集中的表现在他所提出的政纲中，正像列宁所赞扬：“战斗的真实的民主主义渗透着孙逸仙政纲的每一行”（同上书二十四页）“摆在我们面前的是一个真正伟大的人民的真正伟大的思想体系”。（同上书二十五页）
    我们知道，孙中山在一九○五年八月同盟会宣言中，曾提出了“驱逐鞑虏，恢复中华，建立民国，平均地权”的四大政纲，在同时公布的六条党纲中，更把“平均地权”明白写为“主张土地国有”。这个政纲的提出，确是表现了孙中山的“高尚精神与英雄气概”的。它是关于中国资产阶级民主革命的一般原则（民族、民权、民生的三民主义）的最早的口号。这些口号的提出，是告诉人们说：“东方完全走上了西方的道路，新的几万万人从此将参加为争取西方曾力求达到的理想而斗争。”（同上书二十六页）列宁在这里说的“西方曾力求达到的理想”，就是指代替民族压迫和封建制度而起的民主主义的理想，就是如法国大革命实现过的理想。
    列宁同时指出，中国的这个民主主义的理想，是涂上了民粹主义的色彩的，孙中山同时又是一位“主观社会主义”者。这是因为：中国在更加确定的意义上开始资产阶级民主革命的时代，已是世界上帝国主义（垂死的资本主义）和无产阶级革命的时代；在这时候“先进的中国人、所有一切的中国人，因为经历过这种高涨（按：指革命的高涨），都从欧美借取了自己的解放思想；但是在欧美，当前的问题已经是从资产阶级下面解放出来的问题，即社会主义了。因此，不可避免地会产生中国民主主义者对社会主义的同情、他们的主观社会主义。”（同上书二十七页）我们知道，孙中山确是热心的同情社会主义的，他曾把他提出的民生主义——平均地权的主张，主观地看成是社会主义，同时，他还企图“预防”资本主义。但是事实上，民生主义——平均地权的纲领，所反映的是中国广大小生产者——农民希望把自己从封建剥削关系之下解放出来的要求。它只是要求废除封建的土地私有制度。就是列宁说的：“从这个中国民主主义者的主观社会主义的思想与纲领中，事实上所得出的乃是……仅仅消灭封建剥削的纲领而已。”（同上书二十八页）实行这样的纲领的革命，也恰恰正是资产阶级民主革命，而不是什么社会主义革命。这样的纲领贯彻实施的客观结果，也正是给资本主义在中国广大发展造成前提，而不是什么“预防资本主义”。这是中国具体的历史条件所规定的，不是中国的乌托邦社会主义者所能改变的。
    我们知道，俄国最早的民粹主义者，也曾在主观上梦想过社会主义，而在客观上，他们正是在要求资本主义的广大发展。所以列宁说孙中山“与俄国民粹派是这样地相似，以至于达到了基本思想和许多个别言论之完全一样。”（同上书二十四页）而“这个理论，如果从主义的观点去考察，便是小资产阶级的‘社会主义者’——反动者的理论。”（同上书二十八页）因为这种反对农业中的“资本主义”的梦想，违反着社会生产力向前发展的法则。它是小生产者——农民的狭隘的平均思想的反映。这种空想的农业社会主义的思想，从社会发展的观点来看，其性质乃是落后的、倒退的、带有反动性的。
    末了，关于孙中山主义，列宁这样嘱咐我们：“最后，因为上海的数目在中国将增加，中国无产阶级也将增长起来。它一定会成立这样或那样的中国社会民主工党，这个党在批判孙逸仙的小资产阶级空想和反动观点的时候，一定会细心地选择、保护和发展他的政治纲领和土地纲领的革命——民主主义的核心。”（同上书三十一页）
    中国共产党人，以毛泽东同志为首，忠实地执行了列宁这一天才的指示。毛泽东同志用科学社会主义——马克思列宁主义的理论，总结了中国近代社会和革命发展的规律，制订了关于中国革命的整套的纲领和原则，首先是关于中国新民主主义革命的纲领和原则。其中，就吸收了、保护了、和发展了孙中山——这位伟大的革命先行者的革命思想与革命传统中最好的一部分遗产，并实现了它。
            二、关于中国的新民主主义革命
            关于“中国革命是世界革命的一部分”
    列宁在第一次世界大战及俄国十月革命胜利以后，在中国和东方问题上所做的理论工作，主要是关于殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动的学说。列宁关于这一学说的中心思想，乃是把民族解放运动和世界无产阶级社会主义革命联系起来，乃是把民族解放运动看作是世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一部分。毛泽东同志根据列宁、斯大林的这一思想，明确提出“中国革命是世界革命一部分”的命题，详尽的发挥了列宁、斯大林的理论。本文这一段就以毛泽东同志的这个标题，来把列宁关于民族解放运动的理论，作若干介绍。
    首先，关于世界民族问题的情况，列宁向全世界人民指出了这样的一个事实，就是：由于帝国主义的侵略、由于帝国主义大战，全世界各民族已分成为压迫民族与被压迫民族两类。一九二○年七月，列宁在共产国际第二次代表大会上的报告中说：
        “帝国主义大战后所形成的世界图画，其基本轮廓大致就是这样。十
    二万万五千万人被压迫的殖民地——
        像波斯、土耳其、中国这样活生生地被瓜分的国家；一些战败而被迫投于殖民地地位的国家。将近二万万五千万人的国家，保存了原有的地位，但是都陷入对美国的经济依赖地位，因为战争席卷了整个世界，它不容许一个国家有真正的中立。最后，至多二万万五千万人口是在那些不消说只是上层分子，只是资本家享受了瓜分世界的利益的国家里。共计约有十七万万五千万人，这就是地球上的全部人口。”（《论帝国主义对殖民地压迫之加强和东方民族解放运动之开始》，同上书八十八页）
    列宁把世界上各民族区分为压迫民族与被压迫民族并号召被压迫民族起来的这一思想，曾经引起了国际帝国主义列强的毁谤和嫉视。关于这一点，我国一代伟大的民主主义者孙中山曾经说过：
      “世界列强所以诋毁列宁的原因，是因为他敢说世界多数的民族有十二万万五千万人，为少数的民族二万万五千万人所压迫。列宁不但说出这种话，并且提倡被压迫的民族去自决，为世界上被压迫的人打不平。列强之所以攻击列宁，是要消灭人类中的先知先觉，为他们自己求安全，但现在人类都觉悟了，知道列强所造的谣言都是假的，所以再不被他们欺骗，这就是世界民族的政治思想进步到光明地位的情况。”（民族主义第四讲）
    刘少奇同志在分析列宁的前述这段话时指出：
        “这就是近代世界上的民族问题。这就是少数国家的帝国主义者（上层分子、资本家）凶恶地压迫与掠夺全世界殖民地与半殖民地的问题。这种民族问题的情况，又是反映了世界资本主义矛盾的尖锐化，反映了各国资本主义发展不平衡在帝国主义时代的尖锐化。在这种情况下，一方面，不能不引起各帝国主义国家互相争夺殖民地的尖锐斗争；另一方面，又不能不发生一切被压迫民族反对帝国主义，争求解放的世界范围的民族解放运动。”（《论国际主义与民族主义》第三节）
    是的，这也就是民族解放运动产生的根据。由于第一次世界大战和俄国十月革命胜利的影响，列宁说“东方各民族正在觉醒，要实际行动起来，每个民族都要解决关于全人类命运的问题。”（《论东方各民族的觉醒》，《列宁、斯大林论中国》六十七页）
    列宁教导我们：这些被压迫民族的解放运动要取得彻底的胜利，就必须与全世界无产阶级及劳苦群众结合起来，成为世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一部分，以推翻共同的敌人——国际帝国主义的统治。列宁说：
        “社会主义革命将不仅仅是和主要是每个国家里革命无产者反对本国资产阶级的斗争，——不是的，这一革命还将是一切被帝国主义所压迫的殖民地和国家、一切附属国反对国际帝国主义的斗争。”（《论东方各民族的觉醒》，同上书六十五、六十六页）
    在列宁这样的号召下，在十月革命和世界革命潮流的影响下，以一九一九年的“五四运动”为契机，中国革命的面貌开始改变了，中国革命成了世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一部分。
    一九二○年六月，列宁在为共产国际第二次代表大会所作的《民族和殖民地问题提纲初稿》中，提出了共产国际和苏联必须积极去帮助殖民地半殖民地国家的民族解放运动和这些国家的工人阶级的政策。列宁写道：
        “目前不能只限于仅仅承认或宣布使各民族劳动者接近起来，而必须进行把一切民族和殖民地解放运动与苏俄最密切的联盟加以实现的政策。”（同上书七十五页）
        “一切共产党必须帮助这些国家里的资产阶级民主解放运动；首先负有最积极援助的义务的，是落后民族在殖民地方面或财政方面所依附的那些国家的工人。”（同上书七十八页）
    在列宁、斯大林这样的伟大的国际主义政策下，苏联政府自动取消了在中国的一切特权，废除了帝俄时代和中国旧政府间缔结的一切不平等条约；这些“世界人类从来未有之义举”（当时天津《益世报》语），给当时中国各界人民以无限的欢欣鼓舞。这时，中国工人阶级根据中国自己的历史条件，也登上了政治舞台，一九二一年，在共产国际的帮助下，组成了自己的先锋队——中国共产党，从而领导了中国的新民主主义革命。
    同时，在列宁亲自主持的上述共产国际代表大会的决议案中，还“精确规定共产国际与政治上被压迫而且资本（帝国）主义制度占统治地位的国家（例如中国与印度）内的革命运动之间的相互关系。”（同上书八十一页）即“共产国际应当与目前政治上和经济上被压迫各国参加推翻帝国主义的革命力量保持密切的接触。”（同上书八十二页）
    根据这个政策，大会的“民族与殖民地问题委员会”的秘书马林，就奉命于一九二一年初首途来到了中国。这时，中国资产阶级在中国资本主义经过进一步发展的基础上，在十月革命和“五四”人民运动的影响与推动下，在政治上也重新积极化起来。孙中山及当时的广东政府欢迎了接受了苏联和共产国际以及中共的帮助，于一九二四年改组了国民党，确立了联俄、联共和扶助农工的三大政策。正由于有了列宁、斯大林的上述政策和帮助，才有一九二五——二七年的轰轰烈烈的中国民族解放运动的掀起和伟大发展。一九二五年三月孙中山先生临终时给苏联写的遗书，正表示了这位中国的一代民族民主革命家，对列宁、斯大林领导下的苏联的真诚无私的援助和友谊的衷心的感激。
    毛泽东同志在为纪念十月革命三十一周年而写的一篇论文里，曾说：“一向孤立的中国革命斗争，自从十月革命胜利以后，就不再感觉孤立了，我们有全世界的共产党和工人阶级的援助。”（《全世界革命力量团结起来反对帝国主义的侵略》）中国人民革命赢得今天的胜利，正是由于中国人民的英勇斗争在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下获得了全世界革命力量的各种不同方式的援助的结果；正是列宁的关于把殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动和世界无产阶级社会主义革命联系起来的学说的辉煌胜利。
                                                          （未完）
