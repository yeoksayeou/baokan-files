　　Economic Life Trends
  Tianjin Fur Company Purchases Accumulated Down
　　The down that had been accumulating in Tianjin for two to three months has been vigorously purchased by the China Fur Company since the 8th of this month. One million jin of down, including Xining wool, Hexi wool, autumn wool, and plucked wool, have been purchased, and stable price purchases will continue. This purchase not only relieved the pressure of long-term capital backlog for wool merchants, giving them ample re-transportation capabilities, but also made urban and rural material exchanges more active.
  Shandong Vigorously Promoted the Sale of Agricultural and Sideline Products Last Year
    Last year, Shandong Province farmers' total income from cotton, hemp, tobacco, peanuts, and other items was equivalent to more than 4.9 billion jin of coarse grains. Coupled with the sideline income of 300 million jin, the total reached 5.2 billion jin, accounting for about 22.5% of the farmers' total income. More than half of these agricultural and sideline products have been promoted by local product companies, especially cotton, hemp, and tobacco, of which two-thirds have been sold. Over the past year, the province's local product companies have implemented a sales-oriented policy in their operations, which has played a significant role in supporting the development of agricultural and sideline production and in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.
  Jilin Railway Employees Heroically Rewarded
    Railway employees of the Jilin Railway Bureau, standing firm at the forefront of national defense, have continued to demonstrate a high degree of patriotism and internationalism since Xu Guochen, safely and punctually completing all transportation tasks and overfulfilling production tasks. For example, locomotive No. 247 was bombed by the American imperialists en route, and the stoker Yu Shiqiang insisted on completing the task despite head injuries; bridge watchman Cao Rongbao lay under the bridge to closely monitor it when enemy planes bombed the bridge, preventing special agents from taking the opportunity to sabotage it; and Mei Ji Xuan disk worker Guo Zaiyi completed a production plan of 1,000 defect-free pieces. The Jilin Railway Administration specially rewarded them for this, with 32 units receiving collective awards and 38 individuals receiving individual awards.
  North China Textile Bureau Creates Sizing Preservative
    In the past, the zinc ingots used as raw materials for sizing preservatives in domestic cotton mills were mostly imported from Canada at very high prices. The North China Textile Administration began research last year to replace them with domestic products. Over the past few months, under the leadership of engineer Guo Zhanxiong, they worked diligently and finally succeeded. The new sizing preservative has been proven to be 85 times more effective than the old one.
  Grand Canal Winter Repair Project Completed
    The earthwork of the winter repair project of the Subei Canal was completed at the beginning of this month, mobilizing more than 96,000 workers and completing more than 800,660 cubic meters of earthwork. The winter repair project has laid a solid foundation for the spring repair project.
    Moreover, as the Grand Canal is the route for the Huai River to enter the Yangtze River, in order to strengthen the Huai River management and the Grand Canal embankment work, the Subei Canal Engineering Bureau and the Lower Reaches of the Huai River Engineering Bureau have been ordered to merge, so as to concentrate manpower and material resources and go all out. The two bureaus officially merged on the 5th of this month.
  Southwest Regions Universally Repair Water Conservancy and Irrigation Projects
    The provinces and regions of the Southwest are now making use of the agricultural off-season to universally repair water conservancy and irrigation projects. The famous Dujiangyan Irrigation System in western Sichuan is nearing completion of its annual repair project. In the mountainous areas of the Southwest, where there are many terraced fields, small ponds and weirs for irrigation are very important. According to statistics, the large and small water conservancy projects completed in Guizhou Province can irrigate more than 20,000 mu of farmland, which can increase grain production by 5 million jin. Among them, the Zhongcaosi Irrigation Project in Guizhu County was under construction for nine years before liberation, consuming more than 2.6 million jin of rice without completion. Last winter, it was completed under the leadership of the People's Government. Other projects include the Chugong Weir in Jiangbei County and the Shahepu Pond Weir in Liangshan County in eastern Sichuan, the Duyu Township Pond Weir (six locations) in Xichong County in northern Sichuan, and the Zhougong Canal in Ya'an County in western Sichuan, some of which can irrigate hundreds of mu of farmland, and some can irrigate tens of thousands of mu.
