　　Standing Forever on the Front Line of National Defense
     ——A Self-Account of the Ideological Transformation of Young Intellectual Li Bai
    Before the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, I was a freshman in university. I had participated in student movements against hunger and persecution, and had been beaten by secret agents and received threatening letters with pistols drawn on them. Therefore, I felt that I had contributed some strength to the revolution. I used to think that, under the duress of the enemy's bayonets and water cannons, for the benefit of more people, and to oppose the violent and reactionary rulers, boldly abandoning the affections of a warm family and setting aside the meeting time with a young lover, throwing myself into the real struggle; these, I thought, were heroic acts.
    After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing in 1949, I was admitted to the North China People's Revolutionary University. At school, I worked on wall newspapers, recreational activities, evening parties, and playing the waist drum, showing myself to be very active and becoming an activist in the school at that time. As a result, I was honorably accepted as a member of the New Democratic Youth League. After graduation, I fantasized: wearing a sparkling "August 1st" cap badge, wearing a green military uniform, and holding a weapon, becoming a people's soldier defending the motherland; how glorious and proud that would be! Therefore, I resolutely put forward the request to join the army.
    When I arrived at the army unit, everything felt new, such as getting up in the company in the morning, doing exercises, attending classes, eating collectively, playing collective games, etc., all of which made me feel novel. I embraced this new life with great interest. I often listened intently to the soldiers talking about battle stories, and I was often so excited by these stories that I could not restrain myself. However, soon I began to become impatient. For example, one day, when I was teaching arithmetic to the soldiers, when I talked about the circumference ratio of 3.1416, one soldier asked, "Teacher, is there a difference between a large circumference ratio and a small circumference ratio?" I said, "There is no difference." He then asked, "Then the circumference ratio of a large water vat and a small teacup is the same?" I thought to myself: Why is this person so clueless? I impatiently said, "Of course it's the same!" The soldier rolled his eyes and then asked, "Then what exactly is 3.1416?" You see, I had been talking for a long time, but he hadn't understood a bit! I had to explain the principle again, and when I asked him again, he still didn't understand and asked for an example. I was really a little angry, and I couldn't help but say, "How stupid! Not as good as a primary school student in Beijing!" The soldier blushed and sat down without saying a word. Not long after class, the political instructor came to talk to me, it turned out that the soldier had given me his opinion, but I righteously said to the political instructor, "I spent a lot of effort and explained it repeatedly, if he can't understand it himself, who can be blamed?" The political instructor said to me gently, "Our soldiers are older, they have suffered since they were young, have not gone to school, and have been tempered in the war for so long, their memory is not as strong as that of primary school students; however, their comprehension and level of understanding of problems are still high, as long as you can explain the principle clearly..." I blushed. I walked around the pool, thinking about how I had participated in vigorous revolutionary activities, how could I be like this now, this trivial work, it's not my ideal; I want to carry a gun, ride a horse, and gallop across the motherland, to be a soldier defending the motherland. Besides, with my college education, I can't even explain elementary school arithmetic? In short, the leadership doesn't understand me.
    When I was in a low mood, I happened to encounter some external adverse influences, which made me even more uneasy about my work. One day, I ran into an old classmate, who is now a clerk, and as soon as he saw me, he said, "Look, my job is much freer! Why put on a military uniform and look for discomfort?" My heart was a little shaken, my lover, my mother, evening walks by the river, reading hard under dim lights, a soft bed and sleeping until late in the morning... all of them were reflected in my mind for a moment.
    One day, my lover sent me a letter, saying that she was suffering from a cold, and if the cold developed, she would lose her voice that could sing loud songs. I became uneasy. I wanted to go see her right away. However, there were more than forty Chinese homework assignments on the desk. I was really worried. When I picked up the pen, I seemed to see her looking at me worriedly... I couldn't revise it at all. I went to the political instructor to ask for leave, and was startled as soon as I stepped into his room. Squad Leader Li Laiquan of the Third Squad was sitting in a chair, and a woman was sitting next to him. Squad Leader of the Third Squad said with a flushed face, "Political Instructor, my mother is dead, it's not that I don't want to go back, you think, our family used to have seven people, and the landlord forced us to flee the famine, my younger brother starved to death on the way! My thirteen-year-old sister was sold for eight silver dollars to a street performer, and my grandmother was so heartbroken that she cried and fell ill and died in the mountain temple. Later, we ran to the liberated area, and the villagers in the liberated area settled us down, gave us a brick house and three acres of paddy fields; in the land reform in 1947, my family was given five acres of paddy fields and three tile-roofed houses. Now I don't have to worry about food and clothing..." He saw me, and then said, "Without the Party, without Chairman Mao and the country, I would have died in the mountain gully. My mother is dead, I haven't seen her for seven years, of course I'm sad. Yesterday, I was sad all night, she never enjoyed happiness in her life! But I also thought that if my mother died, there would be villagers and family members to take care of her, what's the use of me going back to see her? The most important thing is that I am the squad leader, and I want to lead a squad to complete the task of defending the country?" He said it so calmly and naturally, and every sentence was reasonable. Hearing him paying no attention to personal matters, I couldn't help but feel my face burning, ashamed of myself for planning for personal matters all day long. The squad leader of the Third Squad looked at me, and I quickly avoided his gaze. The thought of asking for leave had long since vanished. I saw the qualities of a great people's soldier and felt how selfish and insignificant I was!
    Another time, the troops went to produce, and the task of our company was to repair the river embankment. Once, it rained heavily, and a gap opened in the middle of the embankment, and the river water rushed out violently. We were standing in an extremely dangerous place. I couldn't help but look back timidly, observing the route of retreat. However, the soldiers rushed to the breach like fierce tigers, one soldier - this is the soldier I thought was "stupid", he blocked the flood with his body, his face flushed red, and blood flowed from his nose and mouth, he shouted "Bring the sacks!" Other soldiers jumped into the flood one after another, like a row of human dams. I was dazzled, I looked at these so-called "stupid" soldiers, like a giant, like a mountain, they were so brave and selfless for the sake of the river not flooding, for the benefit of the people. My eyes were red. Here, I thought of death, and also thought of escaping death! And they - the heroic soldiers, rushed to the flood that could engulf them, and heroically rescued the lives and property of the people in a dozen villages. What is this called? I can't say, I just feel my insignificance, and feel how shameful my petty-bourgeois egoism is!
    Last year, during the "May Day" holiday, our troops participated in this great festival. When our neat ranks marched in the rain in the capital of the motherland, people said one after another, "So neat!" "Still coming in such heavy rain?" One person answered simply, "The People's Liberation Army is not afraid of anything, are they still afraid of rain?" Some shouted "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" My blood boiled, I felt the glory of being a soldier of the People's Liberation Army! Glory! I put on the "August 1st" red star cap, put on the green military uniform, and was respected by the people of the whole country and praised by the people of the world. Thinking of my hesitation when the classmate who became a clerk asked me to escape this glorious position, I really felt ashamed!
    Now, in my work, I feel the deep love of the superiors and comrades for myself, so I am mentally at ease with my work. Of course, I still have many shortcomings, but in the People's Liberation Army, such a great revolutionary university and big family, there are no shortcomings that cannot be corrected. Although I have a college education, I am still far behind the old soldiers. Under the education of the Party, the League, and the superiors in the army, and with the help of my comrades, I am determined to work hard and always stand on the front line of national defense!

　　永远站在国防前线上
     ——青年知识分子黎白思想转变的自述
    在平津解放前，我是一个大学一年级的学生，曾经参加过反饥饿、反迫害等等学生运动；并且挨过特务的打，收到过画着手枪的恐吓信。因此，觉得自己曾对革命尽了一些力量。我曾这样想：在敌人刺刀、水龙威逼之下，为了更多人的利益，为了反对强暴的反动统治者，大胆地抛开了温暖家庭的爱抚，放开了年青的爱人的聚会时间，投入了现实的斗争；这些，我都以为是英雄的行为。
    一九四九年平津解放后，我考入了华北人民革命大学。在学校搞墙报，搞康乐，晚会，打腰鼓等，表现得很活跃，成为当时学校的一个积极分子。因此，我光荣地被接受为新民主主义青年团团员。毕业后，我幻想着：戴上闪光的“八一”帽徽，穿上绿色的军装，拿着武器，做一个保卫祖国的人民战士；这，该是多么光荣和骄傲的事！于是，我就坚决提出了参军的要求。
    我到部队后，一切都感到新鲜，如连队里早晨起床，出操，上课，集体吃饭，集体游戏等等，都使我感到新奇。对这新的生活，我抱着极大兴趣。我常常倾心地听着战士们谈论战斗的故事，并且常常为这些故事兴奋得不能抑制自己。可是，不久我开始不大耐烦了。如有一天，我给战士上算术课，当讲到圆周率三·一四一六时，一个战士问道：“教员，大圆周率和小圆周率有没有不同？”我说：“没有什么不同。”他又问：“那么一个大水缸和一个小茶碗的圆周率都是一样的吗？”我心里想：为什么这个人脑子这么不通呢？我就不耐烦地说：“当然一样了！”那个战士翻了翻眼皮却又问：“那三·一四一六倒底是怎么回事？”你看，我讲了半天，他却一点也没有听懂！我只好又把道理讲了一遍，再问他，他还不懂，还要求举一个例子。我真有点火了，我不由得说：“真笨呀！还不如北京的小学生！”那个战士红起脸来，一声不响地坐下了。下课不一会，指导员就找我谈话，原来那个战士给我提了意见，但我理直气壮地向指导员说：“我费了不少劲，反复讲过的，他自己榆木疙瘩解不开，能怪谁？”指导员温和地对我说：“咱们战士年纪大一些，他们从小受苦，没有上过学，又在战争中磨炼了这么久，记忆力不像小学生那样强；但是，理解力和认识问题的水平还高，只要你能讲明道理……”我红了脸。我走到水池边上转来转去，我想到我曾经参加过轰轰烈烈的革命活动，怎么现在能这样，这样琐碎的工作，不是我的理想；我要带上枪，跨上马，在祖国土地上驰骋，作个捍卫祖国的战士。再说，就凭我这个大学生，一个小学的算术还能讲不清？总之，领导上是不了解我的。
    情绪低落的时候，偏偏又遇到一些外来的不良影响，更加使自己对工作不安心起来。一天，我碰到了一个旧同学，现在他当了职员，一见了就说：“你看，我这个工作自由多了！何必穿上军装找不自在呢？”我心眼里有点动摇了，爱人，母亲，傍晚河边的散步，暗暗灯光下的苦读，柔软的床和日上三竿的好眠……一时都倒映上来了。
    一天，爱人来了信，她说她正患感冒，如果感冒发展起来，就会失掉那能唱出嘹亮歌声的嗓子。我忐忑不安起来。我想马上去看看她。可是，摆在桌上偏偏有四十多本国文作业。我真发了愁，拿起笔来，仿佛看见她正愁苦地望着我……我一点也修改不下去了。我去找指导员请假，刚踏进他的屋子时，就吃了一惊。三班班长李来全坐在椅子上，他旁边坐着一个妇女。三班班长涨红着脸说：“指导员，我母亲死了，不是我不回去，你想，我们家过去七口人，叫地主逼的逃了荒，弟弟半道饿死了！十三岁的妹妹，八块白洋卖给了耍把式的，奶奶心痛孩子连哭带病死在山神庙。后来我们跑到了解放区，解放区的乡亲安顿了我们，给了我们一间砖房，三亩水地；一九四七年土地改革，我家又分了五亩水地，三间瓦房。现在吃穿不愁……”他看见了我，接着说：“没有党，没有毛主席和国家，我会死在山沟里。母亲死了，七年没有见过她，我当然难过。昨天，我整整难过了一夜，她老人家一辈子没有享过福！但又想到母亲死了，会有村里和家里人照料，我妻子要我回去，我回去看看又有什么用？最主要的，我是班长，我要领导一班人完成保卫国家的任务？”他说得那样镇定而自然，句句都有理。听到他毫不注意个人的事，我不禁脸上发烧，惭愧自己终日为个人的事打算。三班长看了看我，我忙闪开了他的眼光。我请假的念头早就烟消雾散了。我看到了伟大人民战士的品质，感到自己是那样的自私和渺小！
    又一次，部队生产去了，我们连的任务是修补河堤。一次下起暴雨，河堤中间开了个口，河水汹涌地冲出来，我们站在极危险的地方。我不由畏缩地向后看了看，观察撤退的路子。但是，战士们却像猛虎一样地向决口扑去，一个战士——这就是我认为“笨”的战士，他用身子堵住了大水，脸冲得通红，鼻子和嘴淌出了血，他大喊“拿麻袋来！”其他战士们先后跳入大水中，像一排人埝。我眼花了，我看着这些所谓“笨”战士，像一个巨人，像一座山，他们为了河水不泛滥，为了人民的利益，竟都是这样的英勇，这样的奋不顾身。我眼圈红了。在这里，我想到了死，也想到了逃避死！而他们——英勇的战士，却奔向可以吞没他们的洪水，英勇地抢救了十几个村庄的人民的生命和财产。这叫什么呢？我说不出，我只是感到自己的渺小，感到自己的小资产阶级的利己主义是多么可耻！
    去年“五一”节时，我们部队参加了这个伟大的节日。当我们整齐的队伍冒着雨，在祖国的首都游行的时候，人们纷纷说：“真整齐呀！”“这么大雨还来？”一个人干脆地回答：“解放军什么都不怕，还怕雨？”有的喊起了“人民解放军万岁！”我的血沸腾起来了，我感到当一个人民解放军战士的光荣！光荣啊！我戴上了“八一”红星的帽子，穿上了绿色的军装，受到全国人民的尊敬和全世界人民的赞扬。想起那位做了职员的同学要我逃掉这个光荣岗位时自己的动摇，真觉得可耻！
    现在我在工作中，感到了上级和同志们对自己的深切的爱，于是我从思想上安心于自己的工作了。当然，我还有很多缺点，但是，在人民解放军这样一个伟大的革命的大学校、大家庭中，没有不能改正的缺点。我虽有大学的文化水平，但我比起老战士来还差得远。在军队的党、团和上级的教育之下，在同志们帮助之下，我决心努力前进，永远站在国防前线上！
