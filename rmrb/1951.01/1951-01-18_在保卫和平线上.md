The resolution pointed out: The Second World Peace Congress demonstrated the solidarity and strength of the peace front and adopted important decisions to strengthen the struggle to defend peace. The resolution stated: In Finland, the movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal has developed into a genuine mass movement.
    The Executive Committee believes that it is necessary to comprehensively strengthen the struggle for peace. The Executive Committee called on all Communist Party members to thoroughly study the various resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress and to find ways to make these resolutions known to every household among the broad masses.
    The resolution finally emphasized: The basic issue in this year's parliamentary elections must be to expand the struggle to defend peace.

The meeting pointed out that the Law on the Defense of Peace passed by the Bulgarian National Assembly is completely in line with the interests and aspirations of the entire Bulgarian people.
