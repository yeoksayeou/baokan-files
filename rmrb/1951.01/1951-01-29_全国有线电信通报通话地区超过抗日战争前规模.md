Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: Through restoration and new construction in 1950, the people's telecommunications industry's wired telegraph and telephone coverage areas have exceeded the scale before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Currently, the national wired telegraph lines have reached 136% of those in 1937, and long-distance wired telephone lines have reached 225%. Coupled with wireless telecommunications, domestic telegraph and telephone communications between the capital and major administrative regions, provincial capitals, and relatively important cities nationwide are smooth. International telecommunications connections also exist with the Soviet Union, Eastern European New Democratic countries, and 54 other countries. Wired long-distance telecommunications line projects were one of the key areas of China's telecommunications infrastructure construction last year. According to statistics, 112% of the annual plan was completed for lines, and 195% for machinery.

Over the past year, telecommunications workers and staff have demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity in restoring and developing the people's telecommunications industry. Many line workers, in order to complete their work tasks, disregarded various dangers, diving underwater in flooded areas to dig mud and bore holes, and blasting holes in mountainous areas to erect telephone poles in flooded areas and on rocky cliffs. Even under such difficult conditions, the workers' construction speed exceeded that of the enemy and puppet regime by a factor of one. Telegraph operators and telephone operators in telecommunications bureaus across the country have universally launched a campaign to eliminate errors in order to ensure the accuracy and speed of telecommunications, reducing telegraph errors by an average of more than 40%, with the Northeast region reaching over 80%. Some workers and staff have also created outstanding achievements in the people's telecommunications industry. As a result, eight models in telecommunications work attended the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers last year. For example, Wang Weiben, a telegraph operator in Harbin, sent and received over one million words without making any mistakes. Before liberation, the "crossover" of China's long-distance telephone lines was designed by foreigners, mechanically using the American "crossover" method, which had large crosstalk and wasted materials. Engineer Hou De, after careful research, designed a new "88-type crossover" method, which not only reduced crosstalk but also saved labor and materials. Last year, the application of this "crossover" method to several trunk lines nationwide saved the equivalent of over 947,000 jin of millet in steel plates alone.

Due to the rapid restoration and development of the national telecommunications industry over the past year, the annual income of telecommunications enterprises last year completed 106.9% of the original production plan. Meanwhile, telecommunications rates were reduced by an average of 30% in the fourth quarter.

In order to cooperate with the land reform, the Telecommunications Bureau has provided free, reduced-fee, and priority transmission services to land reform agencies. In order to cooperate with flood control work, the Telecommunications Bureau dispatched 52 flood control radio stations for use by the Water Conservancy Bureau.

### 全国有线电信通报通话地区超过抗日战争前规模

　　全国有线电信通报通话地区超过抗日战争前规模
    【新华社二十七日讯】人民电信事业经过一九五○年的恢复和新建，有线电信的通报和通话地区已超过抗日战争以前的规模。目前全国有线电报线路已达一九三七年的百分之一百三十六：长途有线电话线路达百分之二百二十五。加上无线电信，国内在首都和各大行政区、省府之间，全国比较重要的城市之间，电报、电话都已畅通。国外和苏联、东欧新民主主义国家，以及和其他五十四个国家之间也都有电信联系。有线长途电信线路工程曾是去年我国电信基本建设重点之一。据统计：线路方面完成了全年计划的百分之一百一十二；机械方面完成了百分之一百九十五。
    一年来电信工人和职员为恢复和发展人民的电信事业，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。许多架线工人为了完成工作任务，曾经不顾各种危难，在河水泛滥的地区，潜入水底去挖泥打洞，在山岳地区，上石崖爆炸打洞，把电线杆子在水淹地和石崖上栽起来。即使在这样艰苦的情况下，工人们的施工速度还超过敌伪时期的一倍。全国各电信局的报务员、话务员为电信的准确、迅速，普遍展开了消灭差错运动，使报务差错平均减少了百分之四十多，东北区更达到百分之八十以上。部分工人职员并在人民电信事业中创出了卓越的成绩。因而有八个电信工作中的模范，曾在去年出席全国工农兵劳动模范会议。如哈尔滨报务员王维本收发一百万余字没出差错。解放前我国长途电话线路“交叉”都是外国人设计的，并且机械地搬用美国的“交叉”方式，串音较大，又很浪费材料。工程师侯德经过细心研究，设计出一种新的“八八式交叉”方式，不但串音少，还省工，又节省材料。去年全国几条干线应用了这种“交叉”方式仅交叉钢板一项节省费用就合九十四万七千多斤小米。
    由于一年来全国电信事业的迅速恢复和发展，去年电信企业的全年收入完成了原生产计划的百分之一百零六·九。而电信资费却在第四季平均减低了百分之三十。
    为了配合土地改革，去年电信局已予土地改革机关以免费、减费和优先传递等办法的优待。为了配合防汛工作，电信局派出了防汛电台五十二座，租给水利局使用。
