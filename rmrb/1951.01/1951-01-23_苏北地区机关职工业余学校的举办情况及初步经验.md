The spare-time schools for机关职员 in the Northern Jiangsu area only had a few trial programs before May. After the Propaganda and Education Conference in April, the机关学校 above the county level in Northern Jiangsu started one after another and gradually became regularized. According to incomplete statistics from the directly subordinate organs of Northern Jiangsu and the four special districts of Huaiyin, Yancheng, Taizhou, and Nantong, and the Northern Jiangsu Salt Field (materials from counties in Nantong district, four counties in Taizhou, and two counties in Huaiyin are still missing), a total of 33 机关学校 (all equivalent to complete primary schools) have been established, with 3,928 students enrolled, 56 full-time teachers, and 111 part-time teachers hired.

Due to the attention of the leadership, the active work of the teachers, and the hard work of the students, great achievements have been made. For example, the District Party Committee and Administrative Office directly under the district, and the Yancheng City 地专 directly subordinate 机关学校, completed a semester's courses from the beginning of June to the end of September. Generally, those who were illiterate when they enrolled can now recognize about 200 characters, with the best recognizing 300 characters. In arithmetic, starting from learning Arabic numerals, they can now calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division within three digits. The intermediate class has mostly learned the four arithmetic operations of integers and decimals and compound numbers. Some clerks who originally could not keep accounts and calculate have now initially learned to keep accounts and calculate. The intermediate class also learned about natural phenomena and primitive communist and slave societies in common sense (the ordinary class is a combined national common sense), enabling students to begin to understand the causes of wind, frost, rain, and dew, and to understand the truth that labor created mankind and created the world. Everyone is very happy. For example, some students who are absent due to work will automatically find teachers to make up lessons, and even those who are sick will come to school to study, and some comrades will save their subsidies to buy dictionaries.

The preliminary experience of running 机关职员 spare-time schools in the past six months is:

1.  It is necessary to conduct in-depth mobilization and earnestly break through the ideology of worker-peasant cadres learning culture, so that learning culture becomes a conscious and voluntary requirement of worker-peasant cadres. In addition, it is necessary to break through the thinking of administrative leaders, so that the leadership can not only encourage them to study well, but also appropriately reduce some of the students' work; at the same time, they can pay more attention to the 机关学校 and help the 机关学校 solve some specific difficulties. This is the main key to the development and consolidation of 机关学校.

2.  To run regular 机关学校, it is necessary to clarify the guiding principles and objectives, stipulate the school system and curriculum, and earnestly implement them in order to run well. Experience has proven that those who implement the principle of cultural education as the main focus, mobilize worker-peasant cadres with a level below complete primary school to enroll, and organize classes according to their level, stipulate the school year, have unified teaching materials and a certain progress, have achieved great results. On the contrary, such as the 机关学校 run by Jianyang County in the past and Pizhou and Sui County at present, due to the unclear target of students, no formal class organization, and falling into a collapse situation.

3.  It is necessary to equip a certain number of full-time cadres and competent full-time teachers in order to smoothly carry out the work of the 机关学校. At present, the principals and deputy principals and the directors of teaching affairs are all兼职 by the responsible cadres of the机关, and because they are busy with their own work, they rarely take care of and solve specific problems. At the same time, some of the full-time teachers in some机关 have a low level of culture and lack teaching experience, and some are politically more complex, and their prestige among the students is not high, so it often affects the development of the work of the 机关学校.

4.  Continuously and deeply inspire students' learning requirements, consolidate and improve learning enthusiasm; for example, at the beginning, organize chats about the suffering of illiteracy, pointing out that building a new China requires a higher culture to inspire their learning requirements. In the study, use competitions, election models, and other methods to further improve and consolidate their learning emotions. At the same time, it is necessary to effectively solve the contradiction between learning and work, and adopt different teaching methods according to the specific situation (such as some units are far away and busy with work, they can organize literacy classes, and teachers can take the method of door-to-door delivery. Some cadres have a higher level of Chinese, but mathematics is not good, they can set up tutoring classes to specialize in arithmetic, etc.) in order to organize most of the worker-peasant cadres in the机关 to learn.

5.  Several specific experiences on school organization, class formation, and teaching methods:

    (1) Sound organization and strengthened leadership are a strong guarantee for adhering to learning. In 机关学校, the following organizations must be established:

    (I) School Committee: Each 机关学校 is composed of one school committee member elected by each department of the 机关 and representatives of teachers and students, which is the highest authority of the school and solves all major problems in the school, and the administrative person in charge serves as the chairman and concurrently as the principal. Such an organization facilitates obtaining assistance and cooperation from all parties, enabling the work to proceed smoothly and effectively.

    (II) Grade Committee: After the start of school, each grade first establishes a study group and democratically elects a study group leader; then, through learning competitions, discovers and cultivates activists among the students, conducts elections, and generates a grade committee, the director of which is the grade leader, as the backbone of the grade, dividing the work to lead the group to promote learning.

    (III) Guidance Network: Since general 机关 are scattered, it is necessary to establish groups according to departments and hire comrades who are willing to serve students in the department as counselors to check, supervise and help the students under their jurisdiction to study, solve their difficulties, reflect the students' learning situation, and provide opinions to assist in the improvement of work.

    (2) On the class formation and curriculum weight: Before forming a class, it is necessary to do a good job of investigation, mobilization, and registration of students; you can take the method of first having students self-report, the person in charge of the department to put forward opinions, and then conduct class formation experiments to initially determine the class and post a list to announce. However, doing so will not be completely appropriate, and if inappropriateness is found in the teaching process, it must be adjusted at any time. Class formation should be based on the level of Chinese, but in general, students have learned some culture in their past work, and most of them have a high level of Chinese and a low level of arithmetic. In order to adapt to their level of arithmetic to attend classes, the following two methods are generally used: If each class is in session at the same time, the timetable is arranged with the same subject at the same time, then students in the intermediate class who are studying Chinese can study arithmetic in the ordinary class. If the classes are not in session at the same time, they will be grouped in the class according to the level of arithmetic.

The weight of the curriculum, we take Chinese as the main course, because the objects we are educating are adults, they have a richer life and struggle experience, and their comprehension is stronger, as long as the reading ability is improved, more knowledge can be obtained by relying on their self-study. Therefore, in the allocation of curriculum time, Chinese is the main, arithmetic is the second, and common sense is the third. However, for those who are illiterate who are just starting to learn, the arithmetic time should be appropriately reduced, because their progress in recognizing characters is very slow, and because of their strong comprehension, the progress in learning arithmetic is faster, if the arithmetic time is too much, it will make students feel the pain of not recognizing words and increase the difficulty of teaching.

    (3) In teaching methods:

    (I) Strive to adopt single-form teaching. Because the study time in the 机关学校 is limited, only two hours a day, and the students cherish time very much and urgently require that direct teaching can be carried out in both hours, and they do not welcome indirect teaching in double-form teaching (in fact, self-study in double-form teaching can be carried out outside of class). Therefore, in order to improve the teaching effect and consolidate the learning emotions, single-form teaching should be adopted as much as possible.

    (II) The teaching progress should be slow, and the number of exercises should be large. Because the students are generally older and have poor memory. And the work after class is busy, and there are few opportunities for collective self-study guidance, if the progress is too fast, it will be too much to chew, and the effect will not be great. As for the general students, because of the lack of cultural hunger, there is a desire to achieve quick results, which must be patiently persuaded and educated.

    (III) To meet the urgent needs of the students. Because these students come from work, their motivation for learning is to solve the difficulties in their work through learning. Such as correspondents, who do not recognize door numbers, it is very troublesome to ask people everywhere; affairs comrades do not know how to keep accounts and calculate, and work feels inconvenient. It is necessary to select some supplementary teaching materials related to work and life and use more practice methods to meet the urgent needs of students.

    (IV) The common sense course in the intermediate class should adopt large-segment unit teaching. Because there are many common sense subjects, and there is history, geography, nature, and political common sense. At the same time, the teaching time occupied each week is very limited (about three hours per week). If the teaching method of advancing simultaneously is adopted, the students feel too disorganized, can't grasp the center, their energy is scattered, and the effect is not great; it is best to adopt a large-segment unit teaching method, that is, in each stage, concentrate on teaching the same course, such as teaching history in the first stage and teaching geography in the second stage, etc.

    (4) Absence and make-up lessons: Whether this problem is solved well or not is a key problem related to whether the 机关学校 can persist and consolidate, and it must be given great importance. Because student absence in 机关学校 is a very common phenomenon. According to statistics from various places, the average absenteeism rate is about 20%. This creates a serious problem of make-up lessons. But it is impossible to require that there be no absenteeism at all in 机关学校. Because the main reason for absenteeism is due to official business trips, therefore, we can only strive to reduce the absenteeism rate and strengthen the work of make-up lessons. To solve this problem, the experience of various places should effectively solve the contradiction between learning and work (such as schools can determine class time according to the actual situation, and various departments can take care of students' learning and reduce their work, teachers should be assigned to departments to take the initiative to find those who are absent to make up lessons; students should be assigned self-study progress when asking for leave, and check when leave is cancelled; each department should hire counselors to help students self-study, and widely carry out mutual teaching and mutual learning movements among students;

According to the preliminary experience of the Northern Jiangsu District Party Committee and the Administrative Office 机关学校, as long as difficulties are overcome in time and teaching is carried out earnestly. Ordinary classes (equivalent to elementary school) can complete the prescribed courses in sixteen months every semester for four months. Intermediate classes (equivalent to senior elementary school) need one year to complete. In the implementation, in order to be consistent with the ordinary class, a four-month semester system can also be used.

　　苏北地区机关职工业余学校的举办情况及初步经验
    苏北地区机关职工业余学校，在五月以前，只有少数地区进行试办。四月宣教会议后，苏北县以上的机关学校才陆续开办起来，并逐步走向正规。现据苏北直属机关及淮阴、盐城、泰州、南通四个专区与淮北盐场的不完全统计（这里尚缺南通区各县、泰州四个县、淮阴两个县的材料），计已开办机关学校三十三所（均相当于完小），入学学员计三千九百二十八人，专职教员五十六人，聘请兼任教员一百十一人。
    由于领导的重视和教师的积极工作与学员们的努力学习，获得很大成绩。如区直区党委、行署，盐城区地专直属机关学校，从六月初开学至九月底，已结束了一个学期的课程。一般文盲才入学的，都能识得二百字左右，最好的识到三百字。算术从阿拉伯字学起的，现在已会算三位以内的加减乘除，中级班大都学了整小数四则和复名数。有些事务员本来不会记账、算账，现在已初步学会了记账算账。中级班常识（普通班是国常合编）也学了自然现象及原始共产社会与奴隶社会，使学员们开始知道了风、霜、雨、露的成因，以及理解了劳动创造了人类、创造了世界的真理，大家感到非常高兴。如有的学员因事缺席都自动找教师补课，甚至有病的还抱病到校学习，有的同志还把津贴省下来买字典。
    半年来关于举办机关职工业余学校的初步经验是：
    一、必须深入动员，认真打通工农干部学习文化的思想，使学习文化变为工农干部自觉自愿的要求。此外又必须打通行政领导的思想，要领导上不但能很好鼓励他们去学习，而且要适当的减轻学员的一些工作；同时更能去多关心机关学校，帮助机关学校解决一些具体困难。这是机关学校开展与巩固的主要关键。
    二、办理正规的机关学校，必须明确方针、对象，规定学制、课程，并认真贯彻执行，才能办好。经验证明：凡是贯彻以文化教育为主，动员完小以下程度的工农干杂人员入学，并按程度编班，规定学年，有统一教材和一定进程，这样都获得很大成绩。反之如过去的建阳县及目前的邳、睢等县举办的机关学校，由于学员对象不明确，又无正规的班级编制，以及陷入垮台局面。
    三、必须配备一定的专职干部和胜任的专职教师，才能顺利的开展机关学校工作。现在的情况，正副校长及教导主任都系机关负责干部兼职，由于他们本身工作繁忙，很少照顾及解决具体问题。同时有些机关的专职教师，文化水平不高，缺乏教学经验，个别的政治上较复杂，在学员中威信不高，因此亦往往影响了机关学校工作的开展。
    四、不断的深入的启发学员的学习要求，巩固与提高学习热情；如开始时，可组织漫谈不识字的苦处，指出建设新中国必需有较高的文化，以启发其学习要求。在学习中要运用竞赛、选举模范等方法，进一步提高巩固其学习情绪。同时要切实的解决学习与工作矛盾，根据具体情况，采用不同的教学方式（如有些单位距离较远工作忙，则可组织识字班，由教师采取送上门方式。有些干部，国文程度较高，数学不行，可设补习班专门补习算术等），才能把机关里大多数的工农干杂人员组织到学习中来。
    五、关于学校组织、编班及教学方法上的几个具体经验：
    （１）健全组织，加强领导，是坚持学习的有力保证。在机关学校中，必须建立这样几个组织：
    （一）校委会：每个机关学校由机关各部门推选校委一人及教师与学生代表组成，为学校领导的最高权力机关，解决学校中的一切重大问题，并由行政上负责同志任主任委员兼任校长。这样的组织，便于取得各方面的协助和配合，使工作能顺利而有效的进行。
    （二）级委会：开学后，先各级成立学习小组，民主推选学习组长；然后通过学习竞赛，发现和培养学员中的积极分子，进行竞选，产生级委，组成级委会，主任就是级长，作为级的骨干，分工领导小组推动学习。
    （三）辅导网：由于一般机关驻地分散，必须按部门再成立小组，并聘请该部门愿意为学员服务的同志为辅导员，检查、督促与帮助所属学员学习，解决其困难，反映学员的学习情况以及向学校提意见协助工作的改进。
    （２）关于学级编制与课程比重：编级必须事先做好调查、动员、登记学员的工作；可采取先由学员个人自报，部门负责同志提意见，然后再进行编级试验，初步确定班级，出榜公布。但是，这样做还不会完全确当，在教学进行中发现不确当的，仍须随时予以调整。编级应以国文程度为主，但一般的学员，过去在工作中又多少学了些文化，大都是国语程度高，算术程度低。为了适合他们算术程度来上课，一般采用这样两个办法：如各班同时上课的，课程表排成同时间同科目，那么在中级班学国语的，可以在普通班学算术。如各班不是同时间上课，就在班内按算术程度编组学习。
    课程比重，我们以国语为主课，因为我们所教育的对象是成年人，他们有较丰富的生活、斗争经验，理解力较强，只要阅读能力提高了，更多的知识是可以依靠他们自修去获得。因之，在课程时间支配上，是以国语为主，算术次之，常识再次之。但是，文盲才开始学习的，算术时间还要适当减少，因为他们识字的进度很慢，而由于理解力较强，学算术的进度却又较快，如算术时间过多，就会使学员感到不识文字的苦恼，而增加教学上的困难。
    （３）在教学方法上：
    （一）力求采用单式教学。因为机关学校中的学习时间有限，每天不过两小时，学员们对时间是非常宝贵的，迫切要求两小时都能进行直接教学，复式教学中的间接教学，他们是不欢迎的（事实上复式教学中的自习，可放在课外进行）。因之，为了提高教学效果，巩固学习情绪，应尽量采用单式教学。
    （二）教学进度要慢，练习次数要多。由于学员一般年龄较大，记忆力较差。且课后工作繁忙，集体自学指导的机会很少，如进度太快，就会贪多嚼不碎，所收效果不大。至于一般学员由于缺乏文化的饥渴，却又存在着急于求成的思想，这就必须耐心的说服教育。
    （三）要满足学员们的迫切要求。因为这些学员是从工作中来的，他们学习的动机是想从学习中来解决工作中的困难。如通讯员同志，门牌号码认不得，到处问人很麻烦；事务同志不晓得怎样记账算账，工作感到不方便。这就必须选择些与工作和生活有联系的补充教材以及多用练习的方法来满足学员的迫切需要。
    （四）中级班常识科要采用大段制的单元教学。由于常识科目较多，又是历史，又是地理，又是自然，又是政常。同时每周所占教学时间又很有限（每周约三小时）。如采取齐头并进的教学方法，学员们感到太零乱，抓不住中心，精力分散，效果不大；最好采用大段制的单元教学，就是每一阶段，集中教一样课程，如第一阶段教历史，第二阶段教地理等。
    （４）缺席和补课问题：这个问题解决得好与不好，是关系到机关学校能否坚持巩固的一个关键问题，必须予以十分重视。因为机关学校学员缺席是一个很普遍的现象。据各地统计，缺席平均约占百分之二十左右。这便产生了一个严重的补课问题。但要求机关学校完全没有缺席是不可能的。因为缺席的主要原因，是由于因公外出，因此，只有力求降低缺席率和加强补课工作。解决这一问题，综合各地经验，应切实地解决学习与工作矛盾（如学校可根据实际情况确定上课时间，而各部门能照顾学员学习减轻他们工作等，教师按部门分工，主动的找缺席的予以补课；学员请假时布置自学进度，销假予以检查；各部门聘请辅导员，帮助学员自学，并在学员中广泛开展互教互学运动；
    根据苏北区党委、行署机关学校举办的初步经验证明，只要及时克服困难，认真进行教学。普通班（相当初小）每学期四个月，十六个月可以修完规定课程。中级班（相当小学高级）需要一年即行。在执行中为了和普通班一致，亦可以四个月为一个学期制。
