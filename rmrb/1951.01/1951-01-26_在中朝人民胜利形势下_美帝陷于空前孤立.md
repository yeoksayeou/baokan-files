Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: Since the statement by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 17th, proposing a peaceful solution to the Korean problem in his reply to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, the various activities of U.S. imperialism have fully demonstrated that the U.S. supports the "ceasefire plan" previously passed by the Political Committee only to buy breathing time for its defeated invading army, and does not intend to stop its aggression against Korea. However, as the Chinese and Korean people continue to achieve victories and adhere to the correct policy of peacefully resolving the Korean War, the U.S.'s reckless policy of going its own way has only deepened the contradictions within the imperialist camp and plunged itself into a state of popular discontent and unprecedented isolation.

Even before Foreign Minister Zhou's statement was published, according to a report by the United Press, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rusk and Hickson admitted during a closed-door meeting of two subcommittees of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 16th that "the U.S. supports the Korean ceasefire plan in order to get other countries to support condemning the Chinese Communists as aggressors." Because "the U.S. anticipates" that once the Political Committee's "ceasefire plan" fails, it "may cause currently hesitant countries to endorse the U.S.'s tougher proposal to condemn Beijing as an aggressor." Subsequently, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson himself issued a statement on the 17th regarding the U.S.'s position on the Political Committee's so-called "ceasefire plan," openly confessing that the U.S. only intended to use this "plan" to achieve a "ceasefire" that was favorable to it, and had no intention of seriously implementing the plan's vaguely stipulated four-nation conference of China, the Soviet Union, the U.S., and Britain to resolve the Far East problem. Acheson said: "We voted for the proposal...not believing it would achieve its purpose as much as other member states"; "If such a conference were held, there would undoubtedly be other items on the agenda, including items the U.S. might request to be added. Obviously, we have not made any commitments on any issues that may be discussed."

Just one hour after the publication of the reply from Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government, Acheson, without waiting to receive the official translated text of the reply issued by the United Nations Secretariat, brazenly announced that the reply was "unacceptable to the U.S. government." He hurriedly asserted that the reply "will also be rejected by the United Nations." Even the U.S. United Press had to admit: "Acheson's quick and decisive rejection of the counter-proposal was unexpected." Originally, "he had already written the statement before receiving the official reply from Beijing." On the same day, after receiving the official translated text of the reply, Acheson hastily issued another statement, wantonly slandering the Chinese people and threatening the United Nations to be "firm and united." At the same time, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Austin, upon the order of the State Department, requested the Political Committee of the General Assembly to convene immediately and consulted with representatives of the U.S.-British bloc countries within the United Nations, attempting to coerce these countries into agreeing to declare our country an "aggressor" in the name of the "United Nations" and to "take action, including diplomatic and economic sanctions."

At the meeting of the Political Committee of the General Assembly on the 18th, Austin first delivered a lengthy speech, viciously slandering our country and greatly intimidating the other member states of the United Nations. Austin bluntly stated the U.S.'s intentions, saying: "The United Nations General Assembly must say this, we believe the General Assembly should demand that the Peking regime cease hostile actions against United Nations forces and withdraw its troops from Korea. We believe the General Assembly should reaffirm the United Nations' determination to continue its efforts to deal with aggression in Korea. We believe the General Assembly should call on all nations and authorities to give the United Nations assistance and not to give any assistance to the aggressor." Austin added: "We must act when we can, because if we wait any longer, we will find that our still young unity will be shattered forever." "If we are divided among ourselves, then none of our countries will be safe."

However, all the activities of the U.S. failed to inspire the enthusiasm of the representatives of those capitalist countries who had already witnessed the disastrous failure of the U.S.'s aggressive policy. According to a report by the United Press, the U.S. "encountered difficulties in enlisting co-sponsors" for its proposal to slander our country. Therefore, the U.S. had to individually propose in the Political Committee on the 20th its slanderous proposal demanding that the United Nations General Assembly slander our country as "aggressing against Korea" and demanding that the United Nations General Assembly Collective Measures Committee study "countermeasures." When this slanderous proposal was discussed in the Political Committee, the U.S.'s demands failed to gain majority support. At the Political Committee meeting on the 22nd, when Indian representative Rau, after reading the reply of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Indian Ambassador Panikkar, requested the Political Committee to shelve the U.S. proposal and adjourn for forty-eight hours, although U.S. representative Austin tried his best to oppose it and insisted that the Political Committee take swift action against our country; however, as a result of the vote, he could only get a minority of twenty-three votes, while the Indian representative's adjournment proposal was passed by a majority of twenty-seven votes. This vote is an important sign of the U.S. tending towards unprecedented isolation within the United Nations. Even the Associated Press admitted: The Political Committee "Many delegates believe that this vote was one of the most miserable defeats suffered by the U.S. in the five-year history of the United Nations."

### 在中朝人民胜利形势下  美帝陷于空前孤立

　　在中朝人民胜利形势下
    美帝陷于空前孤立
    【新华社二十四日讯】自从我国外交部周恩来部长于一月十七日在致联合国大会政治委员会的复电中提出和平解决朝鲜问题的建议以来，美国帝国主义的种种活动，已充分证明美国赞成政委会前此通过的“停火方案”，只是在于为其溃败中的侵略军骗取喘息时间，并不想停止对朝鲜的侵略。但是，在中朝人民继续取得胜利，并坚持和平解决朝鲜战争的正确方针的情况下，美国这种一意孤行的冒险政策，只是加深了帝国主义阵营的矛盾，并使自己陷于众叛亲离、空前孤立的境地。
    早在我周外长声明发表以前，据合众社透露：美国助理国务卿鲁斯克与希克逊于十六日在参院外交委员会两个小组委员会举行的秘密会议上，即曾供认：“美国支持朝鲜的停火方案，是为了使他国支持谴责中共为侵略者。”因为“美国预计”政委会的“停火方案”一旦不成功，就“可能使目前犹豫的国家赞成美国关于谴责北京为侵略者更强硬的提案”。在此以后，美国国务卿艾奇逊自己又在十七日就美国对联大政委会所谓“停火方案”的立场发表声明，公然自供美国只是打算借这个“方案”来实现对它有利的“停火”，而根本不打算认真实现这个“方案”所含混规定的举行中、苏、美、英四国会议以解决远东问题的计划。艾奇逊说：“我们投票赞成该案……，并不像其他各会员国一样相信它会达到目的”；“如果这种会议举行了，毫无疑问，在议程上还会有别的项目，包括美国可能要求增加的项目。显然，在可能讨论的任何问题上，我们并没有作过什么约束”。
    在我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长复电发表刚一小时以后，艾奇逊不等收到联合国秘书处发布的复电正式译文，即发表声明，悍然宣布这个复电是“美国政府所不能接受的”。他并且匆忙地断言这个复电“也将遭到联合国的拒绝”。连美国合众社都不得不承认：“艾奇逊之迅速而断然地拒绝反建议出人意料”。原来，“他在接到北京的官方复电以前，就已把声明写好了。”同日，艾奇逊在接到复电正式译文以后，又慌忙地再次发表声明，信口雌黄地诬蔑中国人民，并要胁联合国应该“坚定而团结”。与此同时，美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀即奉国务院之命，要求联大政委会立即开会，并与联合国内美英集团各国代表商谈，企图胁迫这些国家同意以“联合国”的名义宣布我国为“侵略者”，并对我国“采取行动，包括外交的与经济的制裁在内”。
    在联大政委会于十八日开会时，奥斯汀首先发表了长篇演说，对我国大肆诬蔑，并对联合国的其他会员国大肆恐吓。奥斯汀直率地道出了美国的意图说：“联合国大会必须这样说出来，我们认为大会应要求北平政权停止进攻联合国军队的敌对行动，并将它的军队撤出朝鲜。我们认为大会应申明联合国继续努力在朝鲜对付侵略的决心。我们认为大会应呼吁各国和各当局给联合国以援助，并且不给侵略者以任何援助。”奥斯汀又说：“我们必须在我们能够行动的时候行动起来，因为，假如我们再事等待，我们将会发现我们的还很年轻的团结永远破裂了。”“如果我们各自分裂，那末，我国中间没有一国是安全的。”
    但是，美国的一切活动，并不能鼓舞那些已经目睹美国侵略政策惨遭破产的资本主义各国代表的热心。据合众社透露：美国在为它所提的诽谤我国的提案“罗致共同提案国时，遭到了困难”。因此，美国乃不得不于二十日在政委会上单独提出它要求联合国大会诬蔑我国“侵略朝鲜”、要求联合国大会集体措施委员会研究“应付措施”的诽谤案。当这个诽谤提案在政委会讨论时，美国的要求并不能获得大多数的支持。在政委会二十二日会议上，当印度代表劳氏在宣读我外交部致印度大使潘尼迦的答复后，要求政委会搁置美国提案而休会四十八小时时，虽然美国代表奥斯汀竭力予以反对而坚持政委会对我国迅速采取行动；但是，投票的结果，他竟只能得到二十三票的少数，而印度代表的休会提案获得二十七票多数通过。这次投票是美国在联合国内趋于空前孤立的重要标志，连美联社都承认：政委会“许多代表认为这次表决乃是美国在联合国五年历史中所遭到的最惨的一次失败”。
