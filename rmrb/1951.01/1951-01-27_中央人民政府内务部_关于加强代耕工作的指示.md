　　Instructions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government on Strengthening the Work of Substitute Farming

　　I. Ninety percent of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers reside in rural areas. The preferential treatment regulations promulgated by this Ministry stipulate that "substitute farming methods should be adopted to help them solve difficulties in production." All localities must earnestly implement this as a major criterion for measuring the quality of support-the-army and preferential treatment work.

　　II. Arrangements must be made before spring plowing to avoid affecting cultivation. In areas where substitute farming work already exists, last year's experience should be summarized, and the gains and losses of the methods used should be checked to make this year's arrangements more appropriate and thorough. New areas should arrange for the establishment of this work based on regional characteristics. In disaster areas, spring plowing should focus on solving the difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and organizing mutual assistance between the masses and the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers.

　　III. There are many ways of substitute farming. Generally, fixed methods are better, so that the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers is cultivated by dedicated people or groups. However, it must be recognized that substitute farming is a social mutual assistance behavior and should not be simply regarded as a labor burden. Constantly enlightening the political consciousness of the masses is the premise for doing a good job in substitute farming. Egalitarianism must be overcome. On the one hand, families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers should be educated to be self-reliant in production. Those who have the labor force to cultivate on their own should not enjoy substitute farming, so as to concentrate efforts on substitute farming the land of poor families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who have no labor force. On the other hand, the masses should be educated to carry out substitute farming actively and conscientiously. Substitute farming should be carried out by rural agricultural labor and livestock. In principle, it should be based on the village or district, and the method of unified planning at the county level should not be adopted rashly. Those who have already adopted it should summarize the gains and losses and decide whether to continue to adopt it or change it.

　　IV. Substitute farming should be checked regularly according to the season, experiences should be exchanged so that work can be improved, and reports should be made at any time.

　　中央人民政府内务部
    关于加强代耕工作的指示
    一、革命烈士家属、革命军人家属居住农村者占百分之九十，本部颁布之优抚条例规定应“采用代耕办法，帮助其解决生产中的困难”，各地必须认真执行，作为衡量拥军优属工作好坏的主要标准。
    二、必须在春耕之前予以布置，以免影响耕作。凡已有代耕工作的地区，应总结去年经验，检查所用办法之得失，使今年的布置更妥当周密；新区应依据地区特点，布置建立这项工作；灾区春耕应着重解决革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的困难，组织群众与革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的互助。
    三、代耕的方式很多，一般以固定方式为较好，使革命烈士家属、革命军人家属土地有专人或专组负责耕种。但必须认识代耕是一种社会互助行为，不能单纯看作劳力负担。不断启发群众的政治觉悟，是作好代耕工作的前提。应克服平均主义思想，一方面教育革命烈士家属、革命军人家属自立生产，凡有劳动力能自行耕种者，不应享受代耕，以便集中力量代耕无劳力的贫苦革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的土地；另一方面教育群众积极认真地进行代耕。代耕由农村从事农业生产的劳力畜力执行，原则上以村，或以区为单位，不应冒然采用以县为单位的统筹办法，凡已采用者，应总结得失，决定继续采用或改变。
    四、代耕应依季节经常检查，交流经验，使工作得以改进，并随时汇报。
