Beijing Municipal Finance Committee
    Conveys Cooperative Rationing Decision

[This newspaper report] According to the Beijing News Agency: The Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee convened a meeting on the 19th, attended by more than 400 people, including heads of administration, trade unions, and student unions from factories, government organs, and schools in Beijing, as well as chairmen of cooperative boards of directors and supervisors, and cooperative directors. The meeting conveyed the decision and methods of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives on implementing rationing, calling on everyone to do a good job in rationing and conscientiously serve cooperative members.

Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, pointed out in his speech: Our New Democratic economy must gradually improve its planning. The close integration of cooperatives and state-owned trade is an important link in our country's economy moving towards planned economy. The decision of the Ministry of Trade of the Central Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to implement quantitative rationing is a major measure to put cooperatives on the right track in terms of business and organization and to strengthen planning. To do a good job in rationing and to run cooperatives well, it is necessary to correctly grasp the policies, strictly follow the regulations, proceed steadily and cautiously, and obtain the leadership, assistance, and supervision of Party committees, administrative departments, trade unions, and student unions at all levels. Cooperative cadres must implement the mass line, resolutely face cooperative members, help cooperative members, and improve their lives. He finally explained that under the current national financial and economic circumstances, the salaries and benefits of the majority of workers and public employees are relatively low. In order to appropriately improve their lives, running cooperatives well and doing a good job in rationing are of particularly important significance.

Wang Chun, Director of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office, reported on the achievements of Beijing's initial trial rationing in the past two to three months: the total value of goods rationed in December of last year alone reached 11.2 billion yuan, which was 800 million yuan cheaper than the wholesale market price, reducing intermediate exploitation for the majority of cooperative members. Now, continuing the trial rationing, in the first quarter, 385,000 workers and farmer cooperative members will regularly and reliably receive a certain quantity of inexpensive daily necessities on average, expanding the organized consumer market, and also having a certain effect on further stabilizing prices. He finally called on all cooperative staff to rely on the cooperative members to carry out rationing, implement the spirit of democracy, strictly implement the relevant rationing disciplines in their work, not sell to non-members, ensure "fair scales, full measures, and sufficient sizes," not increase or decrease quotas, not adulterate or make damp, not change rationing prices without authorization, not falsely report the number of cooperative members, and not purchase under false names. He also pointed out that cooperative members, supervisory boards, higher-level cooperatives, and state-owned trading agencies all have the right to supervise or inspect rationing work at any time.

　　京市财经委员会
    传达合作社配售决定
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：北京市人民政府财政经济委员会十九日召集京市工厂、机关、学校的行政、工会、学生会负责人及合作社理监事主席、合作社主任四百多人举行大会，传达中央人民政府贸易部和全国合作社联合总社关于实行配售的决定和办法，号召搞好配售工作，认真为社员服务。
    京市财经委员会程宏毅副主任讲话中指出：我们新民主主义的经济要逐渐提高计划性，合作社与国营贸易的密切结合，就是我们国家经济走向计划性的重要一环。中央贸易部和全国合作总社实行定量配售的决定，是使合作社在业务上组织上走上正轨化加强计划性的重大措施。要搞好配售搞好合作社必须正确掌握政策，严格照规定办事，稳步慎重进行，并应取得各级党、行政、工会及学生会的领导帮助和检查督促，合作社干部必须贯彻群众路线，坚决地面向社员，帮助社员，改善社员生活。他最后说明在目前国家财政经济情况下，广大职工及公教人员的工薪待遇较低，为了适当的改善他们的生活，办好合作社办好配售，更有其特别重要的意义。
    京市供销合作社总社王纯主任讲话，报告了过去两三个月来北京市初步试办配售的成绩：单是去年十二月份配售货品总值即达一百十二亿元，比市场批发价格共便宜八亿元，使广大社员减少了中间剥削。现在继续试办配售，在第一季中将使三十八万五千名职工、农民社员经常地、有保证地平均得到一定数量廉价的日用必需品，扩大有组织的消费市场，进而对于物价的更趋稳定也有一定作用。他最后号召各合作社工作人员，必须依靠社员群众来进行配售，贯彻民主精神，在工作中严格执行有关配售的各项纪律，不卖给非社员，保证“秤平、斗满、尺码足”，不增减定量，不掺假使潮，不擅自更改配售价格，不虚报社员人数，不假名套购。并提出：合作社的社员、监事会、上级社和国营贸易机关都有权随时监督或检查配售工作。
