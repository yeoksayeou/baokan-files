　　The 1951 Spring Festival is arriving at a time when the patriotic fervor of the people across the country is surging. The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government have issued "Instructions on Launching Mass Propaganda and Literary and Artistic Work for the Spring Festival" in a timely manner. We should mobilize our strength during this festival, when the people celebrate the Spring Festival and welcome victory, to expand patriotic propaganda. We specially call on theater workers across the country to launch mass propaganda work more enthusiastically during the Spring Festival, and to set off a week of hot-blooded patriotic movement across the country. Centering on the theme of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, we should widely adopt various art forms familiar and loved by the local masses, hold joint performances, and at the same time organize literary and artistic work teams to perform in rural areas, factories, and troops, and help and guide the masses in creative and performing activities.
