Xinhua News Agency, January 1st—The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses Throughout the Party" on January 1, 1951. The full text is as follows:

I. Currently, Party organizations at all levels neglect regular propaganda work among the masses, resulting in numerous erroneous and reactionary propaganda and rumors circulating among the people. These do not encounter timely, appropriate, and fatal blows from our Party. The Party's policies and propositions are not fully publicized and explained among the people in a timely manner, thereby greatly harming the people's cause. One of the main weaknesses of the Party's propaganda work among the masses at present is that Party organizations at all levels often regard it as a task for a few people and a temporary measure, without establishing the necessary system to make it a regular task for all Communist Party members, under the systematic leadership and management of Party committees at all levels. One of the sacred duties of a Communist Party member is to conduct propaganda among the people at all times and in all places, to tirelessly educate the people in the spirit of revolution, to wage irreconcilable struggles against all reactionary and erroneous ideas and propositions, and to enlighten and raise the consciousness of the people. The lack of regularity and organization in propaganda work among the masses inevitably hinders Communist Party members from effectively fulfilling this responsibility, allows the propaganda activities of counter-revolutionaries and the spread of erroneous ideas, hinders the strengthening of the Party's ties with the people, and hinders the Party's struggle to overcome bureaucratic and commandist tendencies, making it easier for some Party members to indulge in simple administrative orders rather than persuasive explanations when working among the people. The Party must resolutely eliminate this phenomenon and strengthen propaganda work among the masses. To this end, it is necessary to systematically establish a regular propaganda network for the masses, that is, to establish propagandists in each Party branch, reporters in the Party's leading organs at all levels, and to establish a certain system for the work of propagandists and reporters.

II. The task of the propagandist is, under the leadership of the Party organization, to regularly conduct propaganda and explanation among the people around them in a simple and popular form regarding domestic and international affairs, the policies of the Party and the People's Government, the tasks of the people, especially the direct tasks of the time and place, and the exemplary experiences of the people in production, labor, and other work, to refute various reactionary rumors and erroneous ideas circulating among the people, to encourage the people to learn from exemplary experiences, to actively complete tasks, and to regularly report the situation among the people to the Party organization, so as to help the Party organization determine appropriate propaganda content and methods for each period.

Each Party branch should select Party members, Youth League members, and labor models and other revolutionary activists from among the people around the branch who are willing to undertake propaganda work under the leadership of the Party to serve as propagandists. The propagandist should have the necessary political consciousness, set an example in production, labor, and other work, maintain contact with the masses, and have the appropriate ability to undertake propaganda work. The propagandist's working methods include conversation, passing on news, reading newspapers, listening to and disseminating People's Broadcasting, writing and drawing propaganda texts and pictures, editing wall newspapers, etc. Each propagandist can choose one or several according to work needs and personal ability. The appointment of propagandists shall be subject to review and approval by the Party Branch Committee and approval by the higher-level Party organization. Each secretary and member of the Party and Youth League branch, and Party members and Youth League members who have regular work contacts with the people (such as trade union cadres, cooperative cadres, district and village cadres, school teachers, staff of mass education centers, wall newspaper editors, etc.) should serve as propagandists.

III. Party committees at all levels should regularly discuss propaganda work among the people, regard propagandists as an important bridge connecting the Party and the people, and provide regular leadership, assistance, and education.

The Party Branch Committee should regularly convene meetings of all propagandists under its jurisdiction to discuss the specific tasks and methods of propaganda work in the branch in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities and the conditions of the branch, check the status and experience of propaganda work, listen to propagandists' reports on the situation of the masses, and give propagandists specific instructions for their work. In order to mobilize various revolutionary organizations to jointly engage in propaganda, the Branch Propagandist Meeting shall stipulate an appropriate division of labor between Party, Youth League, Trade Union, Farmers' Association, Cooperative, and other organizations. The meeting period of the Branch Propagandist Meeting may be extended or shortened according to work needs and branch activities, but it must be held at least once a month and at most once a week.

The Party committees of cities and counties shall convene joint meetings of branch secretaries or meetings of propagandist representatives or propagandist conferences once a month, at which the secretaries of the city and county committees shall report on the current situation and tasks, and preside over the inspection of the previous month's propaganda work and discussion of the next month's propaganda work. Under difficult traffic conditions, county committees may convene such meetings by district. The district committee shall be responsible for representing the city committee and the county committee in conducting regular leadership for the propaganda work of the branch, and shall stipulate the regular scope, objectives, and methods of propaganda activities for each branch according to the conditions of each branch. In rural areas, the district committee shall establish a system of propagandist transmission stations, in which members of the district committee regularly convene propagandists or representatives of propagandists from several branches to impart propaganda content and methods, and distribute and explain propaganda materials.

The Party committees of provinces, cities, prefectures, and counties shall regularly provide propagandists with propaganda instructions and materials. Party newspapers and Party journals at all levels shall regularly publish articles discussing propaganda work and the work of propagandists. Party schools and Party training classes at all levels shall have courses discussing propaganda work, and shall establish short-term training classes for propagandists under possible conditions.

IV. In order to ensure that the people fully understand the Party's political propositions in a certain period, it is not enough to rely solely on the work of propagandists. It is necessary for Party leaders at all levels to directly and regularly make systematic reports to the people on current affairs, policies, work tasks, and work experience. To this end, the Party committees of provinces, cities, prefectures, counties, and districts shall establish reporters to undertake the task of making political reports to the people. The reporter is a senior propagandist and should be a leader of propagandists.

Reporters shall be composed of the secretaries and members of the Party committees of provinces, cities, prefectures, counties, and districts, Party members who are in charge of work in the people's governments of provinces, cities, prefectures, counties, and districts, and other Party members designated by the Party committees at the aforementioned levels. Each reporter must make at least one political report to gatherings and representative meetings of urban and rural people (first of all, workers and farmers) every two months. The topics and content points of these reports shall be stipulated or approved by the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels to which the reporter belongs, and the results of the reports shall be reported to the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels. Party committees at all levels shall be responsible for reviewing the work of their reporters and providing them with various assistance and guidance to ensure that their work can be carried out regularly and correctly and continuously improved. Provincial and prefectural Party committees shall select appropriate reporters' reports for publication in newspapers.

V. The establishment of a system of propagandists and reporters is to provide the Party with a backbone that can regularly play a role in propaganda work among the people, but it is not intended to limit the Party's propaganda work to the scope of propagandists and reporters. The leading organs of each Party organization, as well as each propagandist and reporter, must be good at uniting the activists among the people to participate in propaganda work in various forms. In new areas where a large number of Party members have not yet been absorbed to establish branch organizations, in addition to directly absorbing a number of propagandists from Party members, Youth League members, and non-Party activists and leading them by the district committee, emphasis should be placed on organizing appropriate forms of non-Party propaganda networks. In all mass propaganda campaigns, Party organizations should be good at coordinating with various democratic parties and people's organizations, and organize the staff of the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, the cultural circles, the education circles, and the art circles to participate in unison, so as to form the broadest propaganda force under various specific goals.

VI. Although the rapid establishment of a system of propagandists and reporters throughout the Party will inevitably encounter some difficulties, it is necessary and conditional to solve this problem. Generally speaking, our Party has a tradition of conducting propaganda among the people. Over the past year, in many cities, industrial mines, and a few rural areas in Northeast, North China, Central South and other regions, some experiences that can be promoted nationwide have been gained in the experiment of establishing propagandists. However, in order to truly effectively and not formalistically universally establish a system of propagandists and a system of reporters, the entire Party is still required to make serious efforts. The Party committees of each province and city shall, in accordance with local conditions, formulate a concrete plan for the implementation of this decision within half a year, report it to the Central Bureaus under its jurisdiction for approval, and regularly check the implementation status in order to achieve it as scheduled.

　　中国共产党中央委员会发布
    关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定
    【新华社一日讯】中国共产党中央委员会于一九五一年一月一日发布“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，全文如下：
    一、目前我们党的各级组织忽视对于人民群众进行经常的宣传工作，以至有许多错误的和反动的宣传和谣言经常在人民群众中流传，遇不到我们党及时的、应有的和致命的打击，党的政策与主张，没有及时地在人民群众中进行充分的宣传解释，因此，大大地损害了人民事业。目前党对人民群众的宣传工作的主要弱点之一，就是各级党的组织往往把它当作一部分人的和临时性的工作，而没有建立必要的制度，使它成为全体共产党员的经常性的工作，并由各级党的委员会给以有系统的领导和管理。共产党员的天职之一，就是随时随地向人民群众进行宣传，以革命精神不疲倦地去教育人民群众，向一切反动的和错误的思想与主张进行不调和的斗争，启发和提高人民群众的觉悟。对人民群众的宣传工作缺乏经常性和组织性的现象，势必妨碍共产党员有效地履行自己的这种职责，放纵反革命分子的宣传活动和错误思想的流传，妨碍党与人民群众联系的加强，妨碍党的克服官僚主义命令主义倾向的斗争，而使一部分党员在人民群众中进行工作时容易醉心于以简单的行政命令方法而不是以说服解释方法来对待人民群众。党必须坚决消灭这种现象，加强对人民群众的宣传工作。为此目的，就必须有系统地建立对人民群众的经常性的宣传网，即在党的每个支部设立宣传员，在党的各级领导机关设立报告员，并建立关于宣传员报告员工作的一定制度。
    二、宣传员的任务，是在党的组织的领导之下，经常向自己周围的人民群众用简单通俗的形式进行关于国内外时事，党和人民政府的政策，人民群众的任务特别是当时当地的直接任务，以及人民群众在生产劳动和其他工作中的模范经验的宣传解释，批驳各种反动谣言及在人民群众中流传的错误思想，鼓动人民群众学习模范经验，积极完成任务，并经常将人民群众中的情况向党的组织报告，以便帮助党的组织决定各个时期的适当的宣传内容和宣传方法。
    党的每个支部应当挑选党员，青年团员和支部周围的人民群众中自愿在党的领导下担任宣传工作的劳动模范和其他革命积极分子担任宣传员。宣传员应当具有必要的政治觉悟，在生产劳动和其他工作中以身作则，联系群众，并有担任宣传工作的适当能力。宣传员的工作方法包括谈话、传递消息、读报、收听和传布人民广播、书写和绘制宣传性的文字图画、编辑墙报等等，每个宣传员可以按照工作需要和本人能力任择一种或几种。宣传员的任命应当经过党的支部委员会的审查通过和高一级党组织的批准。党和青年团的每个支部书记、支部委员和与人民群众有经常工作联系的党员和青年团员（例如工会干部、合作社干部、区村干部、学校教师、民众教育馆的职员、墙报编辑等），都应当担任宣传员。
    三、党的各级委员会应当经常讨论对于人民群众的宣传工作，并且把宣传员看作是联系党和人民群众的重要桥梁而加以经常的领导、帮助和教育。
    党的支部委员会应当经常召集本支部所属的全体宣传员会议，照按上级指示和本支部的条件，讨论本支部宣传工作的具体任务和方法，检查宣传工作的状况和经验，听取宣传员关于群众情况的报告，给宣传员以工作的具体指示。为了动员各种革命组织共同从事宣传，支部宣传员会议应当规定党、青年团、工会、农民协会、合作社等组织之间的适当的分工。支部宣传员会议的会期可以按工作需要和支部活动状况而有所伸缩，但最少每月须开会一次，最多每周开会一次。
    市和县的党的委员会应当每月召集一次支部书记联席会议或宣传员代表会议或宣传员大会，由市委书记和县委书记作关于当前情况和任务的报告，并主持检查上月的宣传工作和讨论下月的宣传工作。在交通困难的条件下，县委员会可以分区召集这样的会议。区委员会应当负责代表市委员会和县委员会进行对于支部宣传工作的经常领导，并按照每个支部的条件，规定每个支部宣传活动的经常的范围、目标和方法。在农村中，区委员会应当建立宣传员传授站的制度，由区委委员经常分别召集几个支部的宣传员或宣传员的代表，传授宣传内容和宣传方法，分发和讲解宣传资料。
    省、市、地方和县的党的委员会应当经常供给宣传员以宣传的指示和资料。各级党报和党刊应当经常发表讨论宣传工作和宣传员工作的文字。各级党校和党的训练班应当有讨论宣传工作的课程，并且应当在可能条件下设立宣传员的短期轮训班。
    四、为了使人民群众充分了解党在一定时期的政治主张，仅仅依靠宣传员的工作是不够的，必须由党的各级负责人直接地经常地向人民群众作关于时事、政策、工作任务、工作经验的有系统的报告。为此目的，省、市、地方、县和区的党的委员会都应当设立报告员来担任向人民群众作政治报告的任务。报告员是一种高级的宣传员，并且应当是宣传员的领导者。
    报告员由省、市、地方、县和区的党的委员会的书记和委员，在省、市、地方、县和区的人民政府中担任负责工作的党员，以及其他由上述各级党的委员会所指定的党员担任。每个报告员每两个月必须向城乡人民群众（首先是工人、农民群众）的集会和代表会议作至少一次政治报告。这些报告的题目和内容要点应当由报告员所属的党的各级委员会书记规定或批准，报告的结果应当向党的各级委员会书记报告。党的各级委员会应当负责审查所属报告员的工作状况，并给他们以各种帮助和指导，以保证他们的工作得以经常地正确地进行并不断地改善。省和地方的党委员会应当选择适当的报告员的报告在报纸上公布。
    五、建立宣传员和报告员的制度，是为了使党向人民群众进行宣传的工作得到经常起作用的骨干，而不是要把党的宣传工作限制于宣传员和报告员的范围内。每个党组织的领导机关，以及每个宣传员和报告员，都必须善于团结人民群众中的积极分子以各种形式参加宣传工作。在还没有大量吸收党员建立支部组织的新区，除由区委员会在党员青年团员和非党积极分子中直接吸收一部分宣传员并加以领导外，应着重组织适当形式的非党宣传网。在一切全民性的宣传运动中，党的组织都应当善于和各民主党派、各人民团体协同动作，并组织人民政府、人民解放军、文化界、教育界、艺术界的工作人员一致参加，以便在各种特定目标下形成最广大的宣传队伍。
    六、在全党范围内迅速建立宣传员和报告员制度，虽然不可免地会遇到一些困难，但是解决这个问题却是必要的，并且也是有条件的。一般地说，我们的党有向人民群众作宣传的传统。一年以来，在东北、华北、中南等区的许多城市、工矿和少数农村中，在设立宣传员的试验中已有若干可以在全国推行的经验。但是为了确实有效地而不是形式主义地普遍建立宣传员制度和报告员制度，仍然要求全党作严重的努力。各省、市的党的委员会应当按照当地情况，定出在半年内实施本决定的具体计划，报告所属的各中央局批准，并定期检查执行状况，以求如期实现。
