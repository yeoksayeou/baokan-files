　　Organize the People's Railway Propaganda Network
　　Chen Chunsen
　　On the People's Railway, there is a need and possibility to organize a powerful propaganda network of the Party towards the working masses and passengers of all strata. The Party organizations at all levels of the Tianjin Railway Bureau have established 478 propagandists during various movements in 1950 among workers, engineering technicians, labor heroes, and railway meritorious workers in some sections, stations, and factories throughout the railway, some of whom are train propagandists. However, many sections and stations have not yet established propagandists, and some Party committees have not yet paid attention to the systematic and regular leadership of propaganda work. This is the main problem of the Party's propaganda work on the railway at present.
　　According to the Party Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network and the requirements of railway construction and the working masses, the main task of railway propaganda work this year should be to universally establish the Party's propaganda network. Relying on this propaganda network, carry out propaganda and education on patriotic production competition and economic accounting, and extensively carry out propaganda on current affairs and policies to passengers.
　　In the enterprises of the Tianjin Railway Administration, there are conditions for carrying out this work. In 1950, the Party universally conducted education on the Party Program, the Party Constitution, and the Party's propaganda and mobilization work in enterprises among all Party members throughout the railway. Party organizations and Party members have gained a preliminary understanding of propaganda work and have carried out some Party propaganda work. For example, many Party branches have already begun to establish propagandists and have gained preliminary experience in carrying out propaganda work. In propaganda activities, propagandists not only paid attention to propaganda and solving the specific problems in the current production of workers, but also paid attention to pointing out the relationship between the overall tasks of the entire enterprise and the people of the whole country; they not only persuaded employees to give play to their initiative and creativity in production and develop production, but also paid attention to enhancing the patriotic ideology of employees; they not only promoted advanced experience in production, but also paid attention to conducting ideological struggle against phenomena such as sabotage, laziness, and waste of materials. Another very important condition is that the Party committees have also gradually strengthened their leadership over propaganda work. Many secretaries of Party committees, branch committees, and working committees personally made reports to the masses of employees, paid attention to holding propaganda meetings, summarized propaganda experiences, and attached importance to using ideological education methods to overcome bureaucracy and commandism and promote railway construction.
　　According to the Party Central Committee's decision of January 1st and the problems of propaganda work throughout the railway, this work needs to be carried out from the following aspects.
　(1) Consolidate and educate existing propagandists
　　Among the 478 propagandists who have been established, the vast majority are Party members, League members, and labor heroes, who can mostly be at the forefront of the masses in political understanding, political activities, and production competition, and have close ties with the working masses. If the masses have unclear questions, they will "go ask the propagandists." In political activities, they "take Party members and Party propagandists as examples." However, there is also a small number of propagandists and people participating in propaganda work (who do not yet have the title of propagandist) whose political consciousness is not high, who "speak very well, but do ordinary work," and are even less active than ordinary workers. These should be reviewed and educated in accordance with the Party Central Committee's decision. For propagandists who have "full of enthusiasm" but "cannot speak well or write well," they should be helped to improve their propaganda ability. There are now several ways to train propagandists in various places: propaganda meetings (such as the Fengtai Locomotive Depot General Branch, which holds a propaganda meeting once a week and a propagandist meeting once a month to study propaganda work and exchange propagandist work experience), writing propaganda diaries (such as the Tianjin Public Security Section Branch, Zhangjiakou General Branch, each propagandist prepares a diary to record the content, methods, objects, and effects of daily propaganda, as well as the ideological problems found, etc.), inspection system (the Party branch checks the activities of the propagandists, the masses reflect, and summarizes and improves) and individual talks with propagandists, as well as the Party committee and reporters making special reports to the propagandists, etc. These methods of training propagandists have been proven to be relatively good methods in actual work. Branches that have established propagandists should establish a daily system of training propagandists in accordance with the Party Central Committee's decision. In addition, several propagandist training classes should be held in the first half of this year to summarize the work experience of existing propagandists and improve the propaganda ability of propagandists.
　(2) Develop propagandists and establish reporters
　　Since the propaganda meeting last summer, the branches that have established propagandists throughout the railway only account for 35% of the entire railway. Therefore, propagandists should be established in each Party branch in accordance with the Party Central Committee's decision. In order to steadily establish and develop, and prevent formalism, it can be established and developed first in units where the Party branch leadership is strong, and gradually expanded to all branches within half a year. Last year, some branches established propagandists, but the Party branch did not have regular leadership. These branches should strengthen the education and leadership of existing propagandists and continue to develop propagandists.
　　Regarding the establishment of reporters. In 1950, the secretaries and members of Party committees and branch committees, the secretaries of working committees, and the responsible Party member cadres of administration and trade unions made many reports to the masses of employees on current affairs, policies, production tasks, or the experience of People's Railway construction. These reports were welcomed by workers and staff. Now, the Party committees should quickly determine the reporters in accordance with the Party Central Committee's decision of January 1st. The working masses are eager for the responsible cadres of the Party to frequently give them reports. The workers along the railway line have this demand even more urgently. This year, reporters should go to the factories, sections, stations, and working masses more to give reports and meet with the working masses frequently and directly. The tour reporting system and the transmission system that have been established in some areas are very suitable for railways to adopt and should be promoted throughout the railway. In addition to continuing to use the methods of listening to reports and checking their effects, the inspection of reporters' activities should, in the future, be "the topic and content points of the report should be stipulated or approved by the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels to which the reporter belongs, and the results of the report should be reported to the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels" in accordance with the Party Central Committee's decision. In order to make the various reports of the reporters contact the actual situation, the Party organizations at all levels should continue to be responsible for regularly supplying the reporters with the problems of railway construction and the ideological situation of the masses.
　(3) The leadership should regularly provide propagandists with propaganda materials
　　Among the railway propagandists, there are many people with high school, middle school, or university education. They can read current affairs manuals, Railway Worker News, and People's Daily, and can choose important and vivid documents and materials such as Wu Xiuquan's speech at the United Nations Security Council and Yang Gensi's hero platoon, and conduct timely propaganda to the surrounding workers. The masses even wrote many popular propaganda products and drew many propaganda posters themselves. Propagandists with lower cultural levels still cannot understand People's Daily and current affairs manuals, so they like popular and rhythmic propaganda materials such as clappers, lyrics, dialogues, and big drum lyrics. Railway Worker News has published such things, which are very popular among propagandists and the masses. The Party's propaganda department should absorb propaganda cadres and propagandists to write more of this popular and concise propaganda material and regularly provide it to propagandists.
　　Some propagandists are good at reading newspapers, some are good at talking, some actively learn the skills of storytelling and singing from the art world, some can compile wall newspapers, and some can draw propaganda posters. Propaganda groups and propaganda teams composed of propagandists as the backbone also go to the employees along the line to show movies, perform plays, and give speeches. Many propagandists have learned to use propaganda weapons. The problem now is that there is too little propaganda material about the People's Railway, and even if the leadership provides some, it is not timely. Therefore, the trade union has compiled and distributed a batch of picture books for children, and the political department's propaganda department has published a railway propaganda manual. However, Party organizations at all levels and other departments need to work together to solve this problem.
　(4) The Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over propaganda work
　　Party organizations at all levels must strengthen their leadership over propagandists. Existing experience has proved that propaganda work can be carried out smoothly if the secretary of the branch or general branch can personally lead the activities of the propagandists. This is the case with the Tianjin Public Security Section Branch and the Xizhimen General Branch.
　　At present, the problem of the Party's unified leadership over propaganda work in enterprises has been resolved; however, the problem of how to specifically divide the work has not been universally resolved. The existing experience is that the Party branch or general branch committee holds propaganda meetings or propagandist conferences, directly leads the propagandists to uniformly stipulate the content of propaganda, organizes the propaganda forces of all parties, and acts in unison. The Communist Youth League mobilizes League members to actively participate in propaganda work to ensure the completion of propaganda tasks. The trade union uses its various cultural and educational organizations, such as clubs, cultural and art troupes, and amateur schools, to serve the common propaganda tasks. The work of this division of labor is carried out more smoothly. Someone asked: Some Party propagandists are also trade union cultural and educational committee members and wall newspaper group leaders. They are directly led by the Party. Will this weaken the work of the trade union? No, propagandists must not only complete their original production tasks or work tasks well, but also use various convenient conditions to conduct propaganda to the surrounding masses and complete the Party's propaganda tasks. The experience of many propagandists proves that being a Party propagandist will not only not weaken the original job, but will also add new motivation to him, make him more politically and ideologically improved, and more closely connected with the masses, and make his work better.
　(5) Train propagandists are an important part of the People's Railway propaganda network
　　The propaganda objects of the Party on the People's Railway are very extensive. Taking the Tianjin Railway Administration as an example, there are not only more than 40,000 railway employees, but also more than 100,000 employee family members; there are millions of passengers of all strata on trains and stations every month, and there are vast masses of peasants along the railway line. They are all eager for the Communist Party to tell them the truth, explain policies, and talk about current affairs. Therefore, the propaganda work of the whole railway this year must face the masses around all aspects.
　　"Train propaganda" should be universally promoted this year. "Train propaganda" serves thousands of passengers. It is a new and very important propaganda work that faces the whole country and the masses of all classes and strata. The masses have already expressed their need for it and welcomed it. After train propaganda, the things that are propagated can be spread all over most of China within a few days; there are people from all aspects of society on the train, and the scope is very wide; "Whatever policies and ideas Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the People's Government announce, they can be quickly spread throughout the urban and rural areas through the railway, and the train becomes a propaganda network" (said a passenger). In half a year, the train propagandists in Datong have conducted propaganda on current affairs policies and People's Railway knowledge to 400,000 to 500,000 passengers, which has had a very good impact on the masses. At the same time, propaganda work on stations should also be universally established. Like what the Tianjin Public Security Section and Tianjin Station have done, in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the object of propaganda education has been further expanded from passengers to temporary workers, station vendors, coal children, soil scavengers, rickshaw workers, and militiamen, and they have also been organized into study groups to regularly publicize current affairs to them and educate them to cherish the People's Railway. In addition, propaganda to the vast peasants along the railway line has played a great role in strengthening the ties between railway workers and peasants, strengthening road protection work, and enabling workers to understand the policy of the worker-peasant alliance.
　　There are so many people within the railway and the masses connected to the railway around it. The Party organizations and all Party propagandists should actively undertake this glorious propaganda task.

　　组织人民铁路的宣传网
    陈春森
    在人民铁路上，需要和可以组织起一个党对工人群众和各阶层旅客的强大的宣传网。天津铁路局各级党的组织，已在一九五○年各种运动中，在全路有些段站、工厂的工人工程技术人员和劳动英雄、铁路功臣中，建立了四百七十八个宣传员，其中有一部分是列车宣传员。但是，还有许多段站没有建立起宣传员，有些党的委员会还没有注意对宣传工作的系统经常的领导。这就是党目前在铁路上宣传工作的主要问题。
    按照党中央关于建立宣传网的决定和铁路建设和工人群众的要求，今年铁路宣传工作的任务，主要应是普遍建立党的宣传网，依靠这个宣传网，展开关于爱国主义生产竞赛和经济核算的宣传教育工作，并广泛地展开对旅客的时事、政策宣传。
    在天津铁路管理局企业中，开展这一工作是有条件的。一九五○年，党在全路党员中，普遍进行了党纲党章和党在企业中宣传鼓动工作的教育。党的组织和党员对宣传工作已有了初步的认识并进行了一些党的宣传工作。例如，许多党的支部已经开始建立了宣传员并在进行宣传工作中取得了初步经验。宣传员在宣传活动中不仅注意了宣传与解决目前工人生产中的具体问题，并且注意指出整个企业和全国人民总任务的关系，不仅说服职工应在生产中发挥自己的积极性创造性，发展生产，并且注意了提高职工的爱国主义思想，不仅宣扬生产中的先进经验，并且注意向怠工偷懒和浪费材料的现象做思想斗争。还有一个很重要条件，就是党的委员会对宣传工作的领导也逐渐加强。很多党委、分党委和工委的书记亲自向职工群众作报告，注意召开宣传会议，总结宣传经验，并重视用思想教育的方法去克服官僚主义命令主义，推动铁路建设。
    根据党中央一月一日的决定和全路宣传工作的问题，需要从以下几个方面来开展这一工作。
  （一）巩固和教育现有宣传员
    在已经建立的四七八个宣传员中，绝大多数是党员、团员和劳动英雄，在政治认识、政治活动和生产竞赛中，大多能走在群众的前头，并和工人群众有密切的联系，群众有不清楚的问题，就“去问问宣传员”，在政治活动中，“拿党员和党的宣传员做榜样”。可是也有一小部分宣传员和参加宣传工作的人（还没有宣传员的名义），政治觉悟还不高，“说的很好，干的平常”，甚至还不如一般工人积极。这些应根据党中央决定进行审查和教育。对于有“满腔热情”而“讲不好，写不来”的宣传员，则应该帮助他们提高自己的宣传能力。现在各地已有这几种培养宣传员的方法：宣传会议（如丰台机务段总支，每周一次宣传会议，每月一次宣传员大会，学习宣传工作，交流宣传员工作经验），写宣传日记（如天津公安段支部，张家口总支，宣传员每人备一日记本，记录每天的宣传内容、方法、对象、效果、以及发现的思想问题等），检查制度（党的支部检查宣传员的活动情况，群众反映，加以总结提高）和宣传员个别谈话以及党委和报告员向宣传员做专门问题的报告等，这些培养宣传员的方法都已在实际工作中证明是比较好的方法。已建立宣传员的支部，都应该按照党中央的决定，把日常培养宣传员的制度建立起来。此外，今年上半年应举办几期宣传员训练班，总结现有宣传员的工作经验，把宣传员的宣传能力提高一步。
  （二）发展宣传员，建立报告员
    去年夏天宣传会议以来，全路建立宣传员的支部只占全路百分之三十五。因此应按照党中央的决定：“在党的每个支部设立宣传员”。为了稳步的建立与发展，防止形式主义，可以在党的支部领导较强的单位先建立，先发展，逐步扩展，半年内普遍到所有支部。去年有的支部虽然设立了宣传员，但党支部没有经常的领导。这类支部应加强对现有宣传员的教育和领导，继续发展宣传员。
    关于建立报告员问题。一九五○年，党委、分党委的书记、委员、工委书记、行政、工会的负领导责任的党员干部，已经向职工群众做了许多关于时事、政策、生产任务或人民铁路建设经验的报告。这些报告，受到了工人职员的欢迎。现在，党的委员会应迅速按照党中央一月一日的决定，确定报告员。工人群众是渴望党的负责干部经常去给他们做报告的，铁路沿线的工人这种要求就更迫切。今年报告员应更多的到厂段站工人群众中去做报告，经常而直接地和工人群众见面。有的地区已经建立的巡回报告制和传授制，很适用于铁路沿线采用，应该向全路推广。关于报告员活动的检查，除继续采用听其报告、查其效果的方法以外，今后应按着党中央的决定，“报告的题目和内容要点，应当由报告员所属的党的各级委员会书记规定或批准，报告的结果，应当向党的各级委员会书记报告”。为了使报告员的各种报告能联系实际，党的各级组织应继续负责经常供给报告员以铁路建设的问题与群众中的思想情况。
  （三）领导上要经常供给宣传员宣传资料
    在铁路宣传员中，有高小、中学或大学文化程度的人很多，他们能够看时事手册、铁路工人报、人民日报，并能选择像伍修权在联合国安全理事会上的发言，杨根恩英雄排等重要生动的文件和材料，及时向周围的工人群众进行宣传，而且自己还编写了许多通俗宣传品，画了许多宣传画。文化水平较低的宣传员还看不懂人民日报、时事手册，因而他们喜欢快板、唱词、对口流、大鼓词等通俗有韵的宣传资料。铁路工人报曾发表过这样的东西，很受到宣传员与群众的欢迎。党的宣传部门应该吸收宣传干部和宣传员，多编写这种通俗精干的宣传资料，经常供给宣传员用。
    现在的宣传员，有的长于读报，有的很会谈话，有的积极学习曲艺界说唱的本领，有的会编墙报，有的会画宣传画，以宣传员为骨干组成的宣传组、宣传队，还到沿线职工中去放映电影、演戏、讲话等。许多宣传员是学会运用宣传武器了。现在的问题是有关人民铁路的宣传资料太少，即使领导上供给一些也不及时。因此，工会编发了一批小人书，政治部宣传部出版了铁路宣传手册。但需各级党的组织及其他部门，一起来解决这个问题。
  （四）党的各级委员会应加强对宣传工作的领导
    各级党组织必须加强对宣传员的领导。已有的经验证明：凡支部或总支书记能够亲自领导宣传员活动的，宣传工作就能够顺利地展开。天津公安段支部和西直门总支就是如此。
    目前党统一领导企业中的宣传工作问题已经解决；但是如何具体分工的问题尚未普遍解决。现在已有的经验是：党的支部或总支委员会召开宣传会议或宣传员大会，直接领导宣传员统一规定宣传内容，组织各方面的宣传力量，一致行动。青年团发动团员在宣传工作中积极活动，保证完成宣传任务。工会则运用它所属的各种文教组织，如俱乐部、文工团、业余学校等，为共同的宣传任务服务。这样分工的工作开展的就比较顺利。有人问：有些党的宣传员同时又是工会的文教委员、墙报组长，他们直接受党的领导，会不会削弱工会工作？不会的，宣传员不仅要好好地完成他原来的生产任务或工作任务，同时还要利用种种的便利条件，向周围群众进行宣传，完成党的宣传任务。许多宣传员的经验证明：担任了党的宣传员不仅不会削弱原职工作，而且会给他加上新的动力，会使他从政治上思想上更加提高，和群众的联系上更加密切，把自己工作作得更好。
  （五）列车宣传员是人民铁路宣传网的一个重要部分
    党在人民铁路上的宣传对象，是很广泛的。拿天津铁路管理局来说，不仅有四万多铁路员工，还有十几万职工家属；列车上、车站上，各阶层的旅客，每月就有数百万之多，铁路沿线还有广大的农民群众。他们都很渴望共产党给他们讲道理，讲政策，讲时事问题。因此今后全路的宣传工作必须面对周围各方面的群众。
    “列车宣传”，今年应普遍推广。“列车宣传”是为千千万万旅客服务的，它是面向全国、面向各阶级各阶层群众的一种新的很重要的宣传工作。群众已经表示需要它，欢迎它。经过列车宣传后，所宣传的东西，几天之内就可以传遍大半个中国，很快当；火车上各方面的群众都有，面很广；“毛主席、党中央和人民政府发表什么政策主张，通过铁路很快可以传遍城乡，火车变成了宣传网”（一旅客讲）。大同的列车宣传员，半年来向四五十万旅客进行了关于时事政策和人民铁路知识的宣传，给群众的影响是很好的。同时，也要普遍建立车站上的宣传工作，像天津公安段与天津车站所作的那样，在抗美援朝运动中，把宣传教育的对象，又进一步从对旅客扩展到对临时工人、车站小贩、煤童、扫土粮的、三轮工、民兵，把他们也组织成学习小组，经常向他们宣传时事，教育他们爱护人民铁路。此外，向铁路沿线广大农民的宣传，对于密切铁路工人与农民的联系，加强护路工作，以及使工人认识工农联盟的政策上，都起了很大作用。
    铁路内部以及铁路周围联系的人民群众是这样多，党的组织和全体党的宣传员，应该积极担负起这个光荣的宣传任务。
