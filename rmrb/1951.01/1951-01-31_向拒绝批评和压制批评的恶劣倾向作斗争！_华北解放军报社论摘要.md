　　Fight against the bad tendency of rejecting and suppressing criticism!
     ——Abstract of the editorial of the North China People's Liberation Army Daily

    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, and the military region issued instructions on implementing the Central Committee’s decision, it has attracted the attention of leadership organs at all levels, and some units have also conducted discussions and studies. During this period, the number of critical articles in newspapers and periodicals at all levels has increased compared with the past. However, generally speaking, criticism has not been carried out as it should be. Many critical articles are anonymous, or repeatedly request that they not be signed with their real names when published. After the newspaper publishes some critical articles or submits them to relevant authorities for handling, it always takes a long time to receive the results of their handling and the replies from those who were criticized. There are even fewer articles from leading organs and responsible cadres doing self-criticism. On the one hand, this reflects the critics' concerns about being attacked and retaliated against for their criticisms, but the main reason is that the Central Committee's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals has not received enough attention from leadership organs at all levels, especially some leading organs and cadres who still have undemocratic or even suppressive and rejecting self-criticism bad practices. The existence of this bad practice cannot but affect the improvement of the work of our military region’s troops. The case of Comrade Wang Laiyou, political instructor of the Third Company of the First Branch of the Second Rear Hospital of the North China Military Region, suppressing convalescents from submitting articles to newspapers for criticism is a typical example.
    Comrade Wang Laiyou's reasons for suppressing criticism and rejecting self-criticism: (1) The criticism is not entirely consistent with the facts, and his work has already made progress; (2) The critics' motives are impure; (3) The criticism was not approved by him personally. Obviously, none of these can be reasons, because: First, regarding the issue of whether the criticism is consistent with the facts, according to the results of the investigation, part of it is true, and the shortcomings criticized, such as poor nursing work, insufficient patient explanation of management and education, and failure to make the food account known to everyone, definitely exist. Therefore, this criticism is worthy of attention; "Even if criticism only includes five to ten percent of the truth, then such criticism should also be welcomed, listened to carefully, and grasp the sound core in it" (Stalin: On Self-Criticism) for review. "If you demand that their criticism be 100% correct, then you will eliminate any possibility of criticism from below, any possibility of self-criticism" (Stalin) This is not right. This is only bad and not good for improving the ideological style of leading organs and cadres, and it is dangerous to continue like this. Second, regarding the "motives" of the critics, we should first look at the content of the criticism. If the criticism itself is indeed beneficial to us, we should not retaliate and punish the critics because of their "motives." We should first conduct self-examination, and then explain the facts to the critics and ask them to make realistic corrections. This is permissible and necessary, and it is absolutely not allowed to suppress and attack the critics without examining ourselves. Third, as for the criticism not being reviewed by Comrade Wang Laiyou, the military region's instructions stipulated: "No one is prohibited from appealing to higher levels or writing directly to the newspaper." This is very necessary to ensure the development of criticism for some units and cadres whose style is not democratic enough. When a person being criticized discovers that the critic's criticism was not directly addressed to himself, he should be more alert, humbly examine his own style, find out why the critic did not dare to directly raise the issue to himself, and review and correct it. Therefore, from any point of view, these reasons cannot exist. Even if all of its reasons exist, it can only appeal to the newspaper or higher-level leading organs, explain to the critics, but is never allowed to suppress criticism and reject self-criticism. This is an attempt to deprive party members of the right to criticize, and is a principled mistake that directly violates the Party Constitution, the Central Committee's decision, and the military region's instructions.
    The Logistics and Health Department of the Military Region is serious and responsible for implementing the Central Committee and Military Region's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals. They specially sent a working group and instructed the responsible comrades of the Second Rear Hospital to seriously investigate and deal with this issue. During the investigation and handling process, they inspected the work of the hospital and the company, convened a military meeting to clarify the issue, and the responsible comrades of the branch hospital and Comrade Wang Laiyou both made written reviews of the shortcomings and errors in their work. There is no doubt that this criticism has played a preliminary role in promoting the improvement of the work of the rear hospital and the recuperation company. However, the health department inspection team and the hospital leaders did not emphasize enough the principled error of Comrade Wang Laiyou suppressing criticism and refusing to self-criticize in newspapers, nor did they put forward any opinions on how to deal with it. The newspaper has not yet received the department's review and decision on this issue, which shows that the health department still lacks a deep understanding and sufficient attention to the error of violating the Central Committee and the military region's decisions and instructions on this issue, and should further investigate and deal with it.

### 向拒绝批评和压制批评的恶劣倾向作斗争！——华北解放军报社论摘要

　　向拒绝批评和压制批评的恶劣倾向作斗争！
     ——华北解放军报社论摘要
    中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定，和军区关于执行中央这一决定的指示发布以来，曾经引起了各级领导机关的注意，有的单位还进行了讨论学习。这一时期，各级报刊批评性的稿件较前增多了。但是总的说来，批评还没有得到应有的开展，不少批评性的稿件是匿名的，或再三地要求发表时不署真名实姓，而报社将一些批评稿件发表或交付有关机关处理后，总是迟迟收不到他们处理的结果和被批评者的答复。领导机关、负责干部自我批评的稿件则更少。这一方面反映了批评者有害怕因批评受到打击和报复的顾虑，但主要的却说明了中央关于在报刊上展开批评和自我批评的决定尚未得到各级领导机关足够的重视，特别是某些领导机关和干部尚存在着不民主甚至压制批评、拒绝自我批评的恶劣作风。这种恶劣作风的存在，不能不影响我军区部队工作的改进。华北军区第二后方医院第一分院三连政治指导员王来有同志压制休养员向报纸投稿批评的事件，就是一个标本的例子。
    王来有同志压制批评和拒绝自我批评的理由：（一）批评不完全符合事实，自己工作已有进步；（二）批评者动机不纯；（三）批评没经过他本人同意。显然，这都不能成为理由的，因为：第一、批评是否符合事实问题，根据调查的结果，部分是属实的，而所批评的缺点，如护理工作差、管理教育耐心解释不够、伙食账未能使大家知道等，则是肯定存在的，因而这一批评是值得重视的；“即令批评只包括百分之五到百分之十的真理，那末就是这种批评也应该欢迎，细心地倾听，抓住其中健全的核心”（斯大林：论自我批评）加以检讨。“如果你们要求他们的批评百分之百正确，那末你们就会消灭任何来自下面的批评的可能性、任何自我批评的可能性”（斯大林）这是不应该的。这对于领导机关和干部思想作风的改进，只有坏处，没有好处，而且这样下去是危险的。第二、关于批评者的“动机”问题，首先应该看批评者的内容，如果批评本身对我们确有好处，不应因为批评者的“动机”而反过来加以报复和处罚。应该首先作出自我检讨，然后向批评者说明事实，请批评者作出实事求是的更正，这是允许和必要的，决不容许不检讨自己，而对批评者采取压制打击。第三、至于批评未经王来有同志审查，军区指示中曾规定：“不禁止任何人越级申诉或直接写信给报社”。这对于某些作风不够民主的单位和干部，在保证批评的开展来说是十分必要的。当一个被批评者发觉批评者的批评没有直接向自己提出的时候，就更应当引起自己的警惕，虚心的检讨自己的作风，找出为什么批评者不敢向自己直接提出问题的原因，加以检讨改正。因此，从任何一方面来说，这些理由是不能存在的，即便它的理由全部存在，也只能在报纸或向上级领导机关申述，向批评者解释，而绝不允许压制批评和拒绝自我批评，这是企图剥夺党员的批评权利，直接违反了党章、中央决定及军区指示的一个原则性的错误。
    军区后勤卫生部对执行中央和军区关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定是严肃负责的，他们曾专门派了工作组，并责成第二后方医院负责同志对这一问题认真地进行了调查处理。在调查处理过程中，检查了该院该连的工作，召开了军人大会把问题弄清楚，该分院负责同志和王来有同志对于工作中的缺点和错误都作了书面检讨。毫无疑问，这一批评，已起到了推动该后方医院和该休养连改进工作的初步效果。但是，卫生部检查组和医院的领导上，对王来有同志压制批评、拒绝在报纸上自我批评这一原则性的错误，强调指出不够，也未提出处理的意见，本报至今也未收到该部对这一问题的检讨和决定，这说明卫生部对违反中央和军区关于这一问题决定和指示的错误，仍缺乏深刻认识和足够的重视，仍应进一步检查处理。
