　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 1st: Pravda's New Year's editorial stated: The Kremlin chimes ringing in Red Square at midnight announced the beginning of 1951. Humanity has entered the second half of the 20th century. With glory and joy, the Soviet people look back from the apex of the half-century to the glorious path that our great people have traversed.

　　At the beginning of this century, two giants in the world—the revolutionary geniuses Lenin and Stalin—cooperated closely to create the great Bolshevik Party, meticulously laying its ideological, organizational, strategic, and theoretical foundations. With the fearless spirit of eagles, Lenin and Stalin confidently and resolutely led the Bolshevik Party and the working class towards the armed uprising in October 1917. The Great October has brought a new era to human history—the era of socialist victory. History is now divided into two stages: before and after the Great October Socialist Revolution. Everything beautiful and bright that has been completed and is being completed on Earth, all the purest thoughts and dreams of the progressive people of our time—all of this is inextricably linked with the great names of Lenin and Stalin. Lenin and Stalin have established the world's first socialist country and have shown mankind a path towards freedom, peace, and happiness.

　　The Soviet people recognize and take pride in the great victories achieved under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party. Inspired by Stalin's genius, the Soviet people are victoriously building communism. As they greet the New Year, they are embarking on the great task of realizing Stalin's plan—the magnificent construction of communism. The Soviet people look forward with confidence to their beautiful future.

　　In the capitalist world, however, a completely different picture is presented. There, within the capitalist camp, the New Year is greeted with war hysteria, an arms race, and irresolvable internal contradictions. Life has confirmed Lenin and Stalin's doctrine that imperialism is decaying, parasitic, and moribund capitalism.

　　The editorial concludes: We, the Soviet people, clearly see our communist future from the apex of the half-century. We see the magnificent and grand edifice of communism being enthusiastically built by the Soviet people under the leadership of the genius architect Comrade Stalin and according to his plan. We see the new achievements of the people's democratic countries and the new victories of the working people over capitalism. We see the steadily growing strength of freedom, democracy, and peace, and the victories it is gaining in its struggle against capitalist enslavement and war. As the Soviet people enter the New Year and the second half of the 20th century, they hail the heroic Bolshevik Party, the genius leader and teacher of all progressive humanity, Long Live Stalin! Happy New Year, comrades! Under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, forward to new victories of communism!

　　苏真理报元旦社论指出
    苏联人民充满信心  展望共产主义美丽远景
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：塔斯社莫斯科一日电：真理报元旦社论称：午夜在红场上响着的克里姆林宫的钟声，宣布一九五一年的开始。人类已进入第二十世纪的下半世纪了。苏联人民怀着光荣和喜悦的心情，从半世纪的顶点回顾我们伟大人民已经走过的光荣的道路。
    本世纪开始的时候，世界上的两个巨人——革命的天才列宁和斯大林，亲密合作创造了伟大的布尔什维克党、精细奠定了它的思想上的、组织上的、策略上的和理论上的基础。列宁和斯大林自信而坚决地以山鹰似的大无畏精神，领导布尔什维克党和工人阶级在一九一七年十月走向武装起义。伟大的十月已在人类史中带来了新时代——社会主义胜利的时代。历史现在被分成两个阶段了：伟大十月社会主义革命前和伟大十月社会主义革命后的两个阶段。地球上现在已经完成的和正在完成的美好光明的一切、我们时代的进步人民的一切最纯洁的思想与美梦——所有这一切都与列宁和斯大林的伟大英名有着分不开的联系。列宁和斯大林已建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家，已给人类指出一条走向自由、和平与幸福的道路。
    苏联人民认识到在布尔什维克党领导下已达成的伟大胜利并引以为荣。为斯大林的天才所感召，苏联人民正胜利地建设着共产主义，迎接新年时，正展开了伟大的工作来实现斯大林计划——共产主义的巨大建设。苏联人民有信心地展望着他们的美丽的将来。
    在资本主义世界里却呈现着完全不同的景象。在那儿，在资本主义阵营内，是在战争歇斯底里、扩军运动、以及无法解决的内在矛盾中迎接新年。生活已证实了列宁和斯大林的关于帝国主义是腐化的、寄生的、垂死的资本主义的学说。
    社论结语称：我们苏联人民从半世纪的顶点清楚看见我们共产主义的将来。我们看见了苏联人民在天才建筑师斯大林同志的领导下，并且依照他的计划，正热情地建设着的庄严伟大的共产主义大厦。我们看见了人民民主国家的新成就，看见了劳动人民对资本主义取得的新胜利。我们看见了稳步成长着的自由、民主、和平的力量以及这种力量为反对资本主义的奴役与战争而获得的胜利。苏联人民在进入新年、进入二十世纪下半世纪时，欢呼英雄的布尔什维克党、天才的领袖和全体进步人类的导师斯大林万岁！祝同志们新年快乐！在列宁和斯大林党的领导之下，向着共产主义的新胜利前进！
