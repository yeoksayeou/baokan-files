　　Three Questions Regarding Divorce and Debt
    Question: If a husband and wife live in different locations, and one party is determined to divorce, where should the lawsuit be filed?
    Answer: If a husband and wife live in different locations, and one party is determined to divorce, in principle, the lawsuit should be filed with the court in the defendant's location. If it is genuinely difficult for the plaintiff to file a lawsuit in the defendant's location, they may state their reasons and file the lawsuit in the court in their own location, but the court will decide whether to accept the case based on the specific circumstances.
    Question: If one party requests a divorce, but the other party's whereabouts are unknown, how should the divorce procedure be handled?
    Answer: If one party requests a divorce, but the other party's whereabouts are unknown, the request can be submitted to the local court. The court should use various methods (such as questioning relevant organizations, groups, or individuals, and asking them to assist in the investigation, etc.) to investigate the other party's whereabouts. If the investigation still yields no results, the court should publish the main content of the documents in a newspaper as a public notice, setting a deadline for the other party to respond or appear in court to defend themselves. The newspaper should be selected to be one that the person being served is likely to see. The publication fee should be borne by the applicant. If there is still no result after the deadline, the court can make a judgment in absentia.
    Question: Is a son obligated to repay his father's debts after his father's death?
    Answer: If the father's debts were incurred during his lifetime, and his son has inherited his estate after his death, then the son has an obligation to repay his father's debts. However, if the creditor has no witnesses or material evidence to prove the debt, the son may refuse to repay it.

　　关于离婚及债务的三个问题
    问：夫妻两人不在一地，而一方坚决要求离婚，应向何处法院起诉？
    答：夫妻两人不在一地，而一方坚决要求离婚，原则上应以被告所在地法院为起诉法院。如原告至对方所在地法院起诉确有困难，也可声述理由向其所在地法院起诉，但法院得根据具体情况决定应否受理。
    问：一方要求离婚，而对方所在不明，离婚手续应如何办理？
    答：一方要求离婚，而对方所在不明，可向当地法院提出。法院应用各种方法（如讯问有关的机关、团体或个人，请其代为调查等）以调查对方所在。如调查仍无结果，法院应将文件主要内容登报为公示送达，限期对方答复或到案应诉。登报须尽可能挑选受送达人可能看到的报纸登载。登报费用，应由申请人负担。如逾期仍无结果，法院即可作缺席判决。
    问：父亲死后，其子是否有义务代偿其生前所欠债务？
    答：父亲生前所欠债务，如其死后遗产已由其子继承，则其子有代父偿还债务的义务。但债权人如无人证物证以证明债务事实，其子可拒绝偿还。
