Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd—Guo Shaoyang and Yang Zhuben, two criminals who murdered the martyr General Fang Zhimin sixteen years ago and participated in the "Pingjiang Massacre" twelve years ago, were sentenced to death after trials by the People's Courts of Nanchang and Changsha, respectively. With the approval of the People's Governments of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, they were executed by firing squad in mid-December last year.

During the land revolution, when the martyr General Fang Zhimin led the people of the Gan Northeast region in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle, the criminal Guo Shaoyang actively carried out sabotage. At that time, the criminal Guo served as the Commissioner of the Kuomintang Jiangxi Shangrao District and concurrently as the Commander of the Security Forces, and he murdered countless revolutionary patriots and people in the region. In early 1935, General Fang Zhimin led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's Anti-Japanese Vanguard Northward to resist Japan. When they passed through Yushan County in Gan Northeast, they were surrounded and intercepted by Kuomintang bandit troops and Guo's bandit troops, which outnumbered them several times. After fierce fighting, General Fang Zhimin was unfortunately captured and killed. After the liberation of Jiangxi, the criminal Guo was captured and brought to justice by our public security forces.

The criminal Yang Zhuben successively served as the head of the local armed forces of the bandits. In the spring of 1939, the First Detachment of the New Fourth Army went to the front line in Anhui to resist Japan and established a garrison in Jiayi Town, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province. In June of the same year, the criminal colluded with Kuomintang bandit troops to destroy the garrison and killed Tu Zhengkun, secretary of the Xiang-E-Gan Border Special Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Luo Ziming, director of the organization department, and four others. After the liberation of Hunan, the criminal was captured and brought to justice.

　　十六年前杀害方志敏将军的凶手
    郭匪绍阳在南昌伏法
    【新华社汉口三日电】十六年前杀害先烈方志敏将军和十二年前参预“平江惨案”之郭绍阳、杨注本两凶犯，分别经南昌、长沙两市人民法庭审判后判处死刑，并经江西、湖南两省人民政府批准，于去年十二月中旬执行枪决。
    土地革命时期，先烈方志敏将军领导赣东北地区人民进行反帝反封建的革命斗争时，郭犯绍阳即积极进行破坏。当时郭犯任国民党江西上饶专员兼保安司令，在该地区杀害革命志士和人民难以数计。一九三五年初，方志敏将军率领中国工农红军抗日先遣队北上抗日，路经赣东北玉山县境时，被数倍于己的国民党匪军和郭犯匪部包围阻击，经激战后，方志敏将军不幸被俘遭害。江西解放后，郭犯即为我公安部队捕获归案。
    杨犯注本历任匪地方武装团总。一九三九年春，新四军第一支队开赴安徽前线抗日，在湖南平江县嘉义镇设立留守处，同年六月，该犯即会同国民党匪军将留守处捣毁，并杀害中国共产党湘、鄂、赣边区特委书记涂正坤和组织部长罗梓铭等六人。湖南解放后，该犯即被捕获归案。
