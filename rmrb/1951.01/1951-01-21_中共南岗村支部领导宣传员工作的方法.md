　　Methods of Propaganda Work by the CPC Nancang Village Branch Leaders
　　Chen Sheng

　　The CPC Nancang Village Branch in Jilin Province did not provide much leadership for the village's work in the past. Although the village cadres could still "complete tasks," their work style was very simple, leading the masses to say, "The cadres are working for the country, not for the people." From a broader perspective, the masses all knew, "Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no way for the people to survive"; but when they thought of the cadres' coercive and commanding style, they separated the country from themselves. The cadres, on the other hand, believed that the masses were "lead-headed" and didn't care about their opinions, as long as they completed the tasks. Some cadres even complained, "It's hard to be caught in the middle; if we complete the tasks, the masses have opinions, and if we don't complete the tasks, the higher-ups will criticize us." Zhao Rong, the village branch secretary, was very worried about this and felt like he had a knot in his heart.

　　Since last October, the village's work tasks have become heavier; however, the cadres are no longer distressed, the masses no longer have complaints, and the work is being completed very well.

　　What is the reason? The story is this: On October 15th last year, branch secretary Zhao Rong returned from a meeting in the county with a "magic weapon," which was "conscientious propaganda—letting the masses consciously accept various tasks." Speaking of propaganda, Zhao Rong was not an amateur; he had done a lot of propaganda work during the land reform movement. Zhao Rong understood: "Yes, we have been missing this step in our work for the past two years." Zhao Rong, according to the methods arranged by the county party representatives' meeting, convened an expanded meeting of the branch committee. At the branch committee meeting, it was decided that branch committee members, party members, and some activists would serve as propagandists; work was divided according to organizational system and region, and some work systems were also determined: the branch would report to the district twice a month, in the middle and at the end of the month, and the propagandists would meet every five days; at the meetings, the ideological situation of the masses would be regularly studied, and the content of the propaganda would be determined. From then on, the party's regular propaganda work was spread throughout the village.

　　In early November, various tasks came together, and problems arose in the propaganda work. Because most of the propagandists were burdened with administrative work, there was a phenomenon of being able to attend to propaganda work but not administrative work. Therefore, the branch committee discussed and came up with this method: to integrate propaganda work with the current administrative work, so that both tasks could be done well.

　　Zhao Rong was responsible for leading the propaganda work in Xiaofutaihe Village. He frequently visited the village and thoroughly understood the thoughts of the masses. Once, when he went to promote the issue of resisting America and aiding Korea, he thought on the way: Some people have had a few good years and have forgotten the suffering they endured during the puppet Manchukuo era.... Therefore, Zhao Rong decided to start the propaganda from this issue. At the villagers' meeting, Zhao Rong first talked about the suffering he had endured during the puppet Manchukuo era: he was captured by the Japanese devils to dig coal in Naizi Mountain, and he was so hungry that he secretly ran away, but he was caught by the devils and had his legs broken.... Everyone in the village knew about these things; Sun Yonglu and Feng Rong, who were present, had witnessed them with their own eyes and had shed tears. The masses in the audience thought of this matter and recalled the suffering they had endured, feeling as if they were on fire. When Zhang Dexian was in the "Fenggong Team" during the puppet Manchukuo era, the Japanese devils put his face on the stove, and half of his face was scalded. At this time, Zhao Rong said that now the American bandits want to follow the old path of the Japanese devils and oppress us like the Japanese devils, how can this be allowed?! Immediately, twenty-nine people signed up as volunteer stretcher bearers, and nine people signed up to join the volunteer army. The women also followed up and proposed: "Women must guarantee to pick good soybeans to turn over to the public grain, to enrich the national defense strength." Nine days later, all sixty-two women in the village picked five tons and two hundred catties of soybeans to turn over to the public grain. The warehouse inspection results showed that it was all first-class grain.

　　However, propaganda work is not easy to do. There are many questions that the masses love to ask to the bottom; but the propagandists are not omniscient, and they get stumped after being asked two or three times. One morning in early December, Jing Yongchang, a propagandist from Liangzi Village, was stumped by someone. When Jing Yongchang was talking to Liu Zhaosheng about the Korean People's Army's main force retreating to North Korea, Liu Zhaosheng said, "The army should not retreat; if the army loves the people, it should not let the people suffer. How can the people endure such a tug-of-war?!" Jing Yongchang could not answer this question, so he quickly ran back to the village government and discussed it with the village chief and others, and they came up with a correct answer: The retreat of the Korean People's Army to the north is precisely for the purpose of protecting the Korean people. If we don't protect the main force now, how can we counterattack in the future and completely eliminate the American bandits! Because they can answer questions so seriously, the propagandists' prestige in the village is getting higher day by day. Every evening, many people go to the propagandists' homes to chat and discuss national affairs and production issues.

　　The Nancang Village propagandists also have regular meeting and study systems, so they can timely understand and study the situation in the village, and carry out propaganda based on these situations. For example, at a branch committee meeting in December, the following situation was studied: Someone named Feng ? proposed: Koreans are second-class Japanese; if they get the land, we will be in trouble again. After research, the branch committee believed that this was the thinking of a considerable number of people. These people agreed to resist America, but did not agree to aid Korea. At the same time, there were many Korean people in the village. This problem must be solved quickly. At that time, the branch committee decided to concentrate its efforts on publicizing and explaining the unity of the Chinese and Korean people. After the meeting, the propagandists gave reports at the villagers' meeting, explaining the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Chinese and Korean people in detail, especially citing actual examples to illustrate it. For example, the events of the Korean guerrillas fighting in Futai River before "August 15th." This educated the Nancang Village people to recognize that the Chinese and Korean people are one family. Then the propagandists further explained that the Chinese and Koreans are divided into two groups: one group is the Chinese and Korean people, and the other group is the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee, who are the common enemies of the Chinese and Korean people. Since that propaganda, the village has changed. In the past, when everyone helped the Korean farmers pull the public grain, they always had to pay foot money first before providing a cart; now, when pulling the grain, they don't mention foot money anymore.

　　中共南岗村支部领导宣传员工作的方法
    辰生
    中共吉林省南岗村支部，过去对村里工作不多领导，虽然村干部还能“完成任务”，但是工作方式非常简单，惹得群众说：“干部是给国家办事的，不是给老百姓办事的。”从大处看，群众都知道：“没有共产党、毛主席，就没有老百姓活路”；可是一想到干部强迫命令作风，就把国家和自己分开来看了。而干部呢，认为群众都是“铅灌的脑袋”，管他有没有意见，反正完成任务就好。有些干部还叫唤：“夹板气不好受，完成任务群众有意见，完不成任务上级要批评。”村支部书记赵荣对这件事情就愁得没法解决，心上就像系了一个大疙瘩。
    从去年十月起，村里工作任务更重了；可是，再看不到干部苦恼，再听不见群众有意见了，工作完成得很好。
    什么原因呢？事情是这样的，去年十月十五日，支部书记赵荣从县上开会回来，带回来一件“法宝”，那就是“认真宣传——让群众自觉的来接受各种任务”。讲到宣传，赵荣本来不是外行，在土地改革运动时，他就作过很多宣传工作。赵荣心里敞亮了：“是呀，这二年做工作就少了这么一步。”赵荣按照县党代表会布置的办法，召集了支委扩大会。在支委会上，决定了支委、党员和一些积极分子担任宣传员；从组织系统上和地区上分了工，又决定了一些工作制度：每月的月中和月末，支部向区里汇报一次，宣传员五天碰头一次；在碰头会上经常研究群众的思想情况，确定宣传内容。从此，全村经常性的党的宣传工作铺开了。
    十一月初，各种工作都聚到一起，宣传工作就发生了问题。因为大部分宣传员都担负行政工作，这样就有顾了宣传工作顾不了行政工作的现象。于是支委会讨论，就想出了这样的办法：把宣传工作和当前行政工作捏到一起做，这样两个工作都能作好了。
    赵荣是负责领导小富太河村的宣传工作。他常来常往的把该村群众的心思都摸了个透。有一次他去宣传抗美援朝问题时，在道上，他就盘算着：有些人过了几年好日子，把伪满时代的受的痛苦都忘到脑后了……。于是赵荣就决定从这一个问题宣传起。在村民大会上，赵荣先谈起自己在伪满时代所受的苦楚：他被日本鬼子抓到奶子山挖煤，饿得不行，偷着跑出来，可是被鬼子抓回去就打坏了两条腿……。这些事情，村里人那个不知道，在座的孙永路、冯荣都亲眼见到的，还掉过眼泪。全场群众想起了这件事情心里都火烧火燎地回忆起自己受过的苦来。张德贤在伪满时代当“奉公队”时，日本鬼子把他脸往火炉上贴，半个脸都烫熟了。这时赵荣就讲到现在美国强盗想走日本鬼子的老路，想和日本鬼子一样的来压迫咱们大伙儿，这怎么行呢？！马上就有二十九个人报名当志愿担架员、九个人报名参加志愿军。妇女们也跟着提出来：“妇女要保证挑好豆子交公粮，充实国防力量。”九天以后，全村六十二名妇女挑好了五吨零二百斤大豆交公粮。仓库检验结果，都是一等粮食。
    但是，宣传工作是不容易作的，有很多问题，群众爱追根问底的；可是宣传员又不是万事通，三问二问就给问住了。十二月初一个早晨，亮子村宣传员井永昌就被人问住了。当井永昌跟刘召声扯到朝鲜人民军主力往北朝鲜撤退时，刘召声就说：“军队就不该撤退，军队若是爱护人民，就不该让老百姓遭殃，这么拉锯老百姓怎能受得住哇？！”这个问题井永昌回答不出来，他就赶快跑回村政府，和村长等研究了一下，就有了个正确的答案：朝鲜人民军的北撤，正是为着保护朝鲜人民，现在不保护主力，将来怎么能反攻，怎么能彻底消灭美国强盗呢！由于他们能够这样认真解答问题，宣传员在村里的威信就一天比一天高。每到傍黑的时候，许多人都到宣传员家去串门，谈论国家大事和生产问题。
    南岗村宣传员还有经常的会议制度和学习制度，所以能够及时了解和研究村里的情况，并针对这些情况进行宣传。例如在十二月间一次支委会上，就研究了这样一个情况：有个叫冯?的提出来：朝鲜人是二日本，若是让他们得了地，咱们又得倒霉。支委会研究后，认为这是相当一部分人的思想，这些人同意抗美，不同意援朝。同时该村朝鲜族人民很多。这个问题必须迅速解决。当时支委会就决定集中力量宣传解释中朝人民的团结问题。会后，宣传员分头在村民大会上作报告，把中朝人民的血肉关系源源本本地讲解了一下，特别是举了实际例子来说明。比如：“八一五”以前朝鲜游击队在富太河作战的事情。这样教育南岗村人民认识了中朝人民是一家人。接着宣传员又进一步说明了中国人和朝鲜人中分为两伙人：一伙是中国人民和朝鲜人民，另一伙就是汉奸蒋介石和韩奸李承晚，他们是中朝两国人民的共同敌人。从那次宣传以后，村里就变了样子，过去大家帮助朝鲜族农民拉公粮时，总得先交脚钱，再出车；现在拉粮时，就不提脚钱了。
