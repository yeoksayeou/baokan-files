    Reactions to People's Daily Criticism

    **Self-Criticisms from the Baoding Branch of the People's Bank of China, and the Xushui and Wangdu Sub-branches Regarding Fertilizer Loan Work**

    Editor Comrades:

    In this autumn's agricultural loan work in our district, some achievements have been made in livestock and wheat seed loans. However, the fertilizer loan work has shown relatively more deviations and is relatively serious. Attached are the self-criticisms of the Xushui and Wangdu sub-branches regarding the errors made in fertilizer lending.

    Our branch itself focused on wheat seed loans at the time and neglected the inspection of fertilizer loans, so that it failed to discover and correct them in time, which is also our responsibility.

    We accept this lesson, resolutely overcome the bureaucratic work style in our work, and strengthen inspection work. We are determined to do a good job in rural financial work. In addition to the above self-criticism, we have also given warnings to the Xushui and Wangdu sub-branches.

    Editor Comrades:

    We did commit serious errors during this autumn's wheat planting fertilizer loan. At that time, the plan of the Baoding District Office decided that our bank should lend 300,000 jin of fertilizer to farmers who really had no ability to purchase fertilizer to solve their difficulties in wheat planting. If there was surplus capacity, we could also transfer some from other places through the supply and marketing cooperative, and sell it at a price lower than the market price to stabilize the market fertilizer price. However, we did not follow the above plan, but mistakenly lent 100.73 million yuan of fertilizer loans to 24 private merchants, calling it "regulating fertilizer." As a result of our doing so, not only did farmers who could not afford fertilizer not get a single jin of fertilizer on loan, but they could not even buy cheaper fertilizer, seriously damaging the interests of farmers.

    When fertilizer was scarce, private merchants controlled the market, causing the price of fertilizer cottonseed cake to rise from 69,000 yuan to 72,000 yuan, bean cake from 64,000 yuan to 72,000 yuan, and peanut cake from 71,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan. Private merchants profited 26.55 million yuan. It was not until the supply and marketing cooperative shipped in fertilizer that the fertilizer price fell slightly.

    From the above situation, we have committed serious policy errors in this fertilizer loan. We review the following reasons for the occurrence of this error:

    1.  There is a serious lack of organization and discipline. In our work, we not only failed to act in accordance with the instructions and plans of the higher authorities, but also arbitrarily changed the plans of the higher authorities, and did not report to the higher authorities afterwards.

    2.  There is a serious tendency towards bureaucracy. We tried to save trouble and were afraid of trouble. We did not care about the suffering of the masses, and we did not regard lending fertilizer for wheat planting as a matter of the lives of millions of people. We forgot that we are the servants of the people and should work tirelessly for the people. Therefore, we became divorced from the masses.

    3.  Due to the unplanned issuance of industrial and commercial loans in the spring and summer, funds were wasted, making it impossible to withdraw funds during the wheat planting period to directly lend to farmers. During this time, cadres were busy recovering industrial and commercial loans and neglected the fertilizer loan task.

    4.  We did not study or learn the instructions and plans of the higher authorities, and we rarely contacted the government and the Party committee in our work. Therefore, we failed to correct the error in time after it occurred.

    The occurrence of this error directly affected farmers' production and caused great losses to farmers. In addition to deep self-criticism, we sincerely accept the warning given to us by the office and guarantee to study policies humbly in the future and not repeat the error.

    Editor Comrades:

    We are sending you the self-criticism of the errors we committed in the wheat planting fertilizer loan work, hoping that you will disclose it.

    In order to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage for farmers, we studied with the higher-level bank (Baoding District Bank Office) and decided to issue 400,000 jin of fertilizer loans in our county during wheat planting. Before the fertilizer loan, the higher-level bank instructed that to control fertilizer, we must order it in our county and ask the supply and marketing cooperative to transfer it from other places. However, in our county, where black oil was not selling well, most of the factories were shut down, and new cotton had not yet entered the market, and there was a shortage of oil materials, only 60,000 jin of native tank cake could be ordered. Finally, the supply and marketing cooperative sold 80,000 jin of fertilizer prepared for sale to the bank, which lent it to farmers. However, it was still 260,000 jin short of the loan plan. It was delayed until six days before the Autumn Equinox before lending money to private merchants to purchase in Tianjin and Tangshan. Before the purchase was made, due to the shortage of fertilizer in the market, the price of cottonseed cake once rose to 95,000 yuan per 100 jin (equivalent to six and a half dou of wheat).

    The reason for the rise in fertilizer prices was that we did not understand the situation enough. If Wangdu County had prepared 3 million jin of fertilizer, it would have met the needs of farmers. However, at that time, the supply and marketing cooperative and private merchants had less than 2 million jin in stock (the supply and marketing cooperative had 1.3 million jin of fertilizer). Under such circumstances, we did not plan to transport fertilizer from other places to regulate the market in advance, but adopted the method of purchasing from the supply and marketing cooperative and directly lending to farmers to purchase from private merchants (after the borrowers purchased from private merchants, they transferred the money to the bank), which formed a situation where the bank and the masses competed to purchase, resulting in the rise of fertilizer prices. On September 17, the fertilizer of the supply and marketing cooperative had been sold out, and the inventory of private merchants was also running out. The bank then decided to lend money to private merchants to purchase in Tianjin and Tangshan. However, after the purchase, the wheat planting season was almost over.

    The loan to private merchants was not in the form of asking them to purchase on our behalf, but the private merchants purchased it and then lent it to the bank at the market price. In fact, the so-called "market price" at that time was unreasonable. There was only a quotation but no actual market. In order to obtain fertilizer loans, farmers had to endure the high-interest exploitation of private merchants. Although the fertilizer price fell to 85,000 to 86,000 yuan by the end of September, this was because the wheat planting season was about to pass, and merchants were eager to sell, which caused the price to fall.

    The error we committed in this work was that we did not understand the situation in depth, and the simple task-oriented view was at work. If the bank could control 500,000 to 600,000 jin of fertilizer, the fertilizer price at that time would not have exceeded 80,000 yuan. This shows our weakness in work and the mass viewpoint. In the future, we must remember this lesson in our work and not repeat the error. We sincerely accept the warning given to us by the Baoding Branch of the People's Bank of China.

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

    中国人民银行保定办事处、徐水望都两支行关于贷放肥料工作的检讨
    人民银行保定办事处的检讨编辑同志：
    我专区今秋农贷工作中，牲畜麦种都获得一定成绩。唯贷肥工作发生偏向较多，也比较严重。兹将徐水、望都支行在贷肥中所犯错误的检讨附上。
    本办事处本身当时着重了贷放麦种工作，忽视贷肥的检查工作，以致未能及时发觉及时纠正，也有一定的责任。
    我们接受这一次的教训坚决克服工作中的官僚主义作风，加强检查工作。决心把农村金融工作搞好。我们除作了以上检讨外，并给徐水与望都支行警告处分。
                                    中国人民银行保定办事处
            人民银行徐水支行的检讨编辑同志：
    今秋种麦贷肥时我们的确犯了严重的错误。当时保定专区办事处的计划决定由我行出贷肥料三十万斤，贷给真正无力购买肥料的农民，解决他们的种麦困难。如有余力的话，还可通过供销社到外埠调运一部，低于市价出售以稳定市场肥价。但是我们没有按照上述计划办，却把一亿零七百三十万元的肥料贷款错误地贷给了二十四户私商，美其名曰“调剂肥料”。由于我们这样做的结果。不但使无力购买肥料的农民一斤肥料未贷上，而且连较便宜的肥料也买不上，严重地损害了农民利益。
    肥料缺乏时私商掌握了市场，使肥料棉饼价由六万九千元涨到了七万二千元，豆饼由六万四千元涨到了七万二千元，花生饼由七万一千元涨到九万元，私商得利二千六百五十五万元。直到供销社运来肥料后，肥价才稍下落。
    由上述情况看来，我们在这一次贷肥中是犯了严重的政策性的错误。产生这个错误的原因，我们检讨有下面几点：
    一、存在着严重的无组织无纪律的恶劣作风，表现在工作中不但未按上级的指示计划办事，反而擅自改变了上级的计划，而事后也不向上级报告。
    二、存在着严重的官僚主义倾向，图省事，怕麻烦。不关心群众疾苦，没有把贷肥种麦看成是千百万人民的生活问题。忘记了自己是人民的勤务员，应该不辞劳苦地给人民办事。因此，脱离了群众。
    三、由于春夏两季无计划地发出工商业贷款，将资金浪费，致使种麦期间无力再抽出资金直接贷给农民。干部在这个时间，则忙于催收工商业贷款，忽视了贷肥任务。
    四、对上级的指示、计划不研究不学习，同时在工作中又很少和政府及党委联系，故发生错误后也未能及时纠正。
    这一错误的发生直接影响农民生产，使农民遭受了很大损失。我们除深刻检讨外，诚恳地接受办事处给我们的警告处分，并保证今后虚心的研究政策，不再重犯错误。
                                      中国人民银行徐水支行
            人民银行望都支行的检讨编辑同志：
    兹把我们在种麦贷肥工作中所犯错误的检讨寄给你们，希予以披露。
    为了解决农民的缺肥困难，我们曾与上级行（保定专区银行办事处）研究，决定在种麦时，我县发出贷肥四十万斤。贷肥以前上级行指示，要掌握肥料，须在本县订购和请供销社由外埠调运，但在我县黑油销路不畅，大部停工和新花尚未登市，油料缺乏的情况下，只订得了土槽饼六万斤。最后又由供销社将准备出售的肥料卖给银行八万斤，贷给农民，然距出贷计划数尚差二十六万斤。一直拖延到秋分前六日才贷款给私商去津、唐一带购买，在买回前集上因肥料缺乏，使每百斤棉仁饼曾一度上涨到九万五千元（合六斗半小麦）。
    肥价上涨的原因是因为我们对情况了解不够。如果望都全县准备三百万斤肥料，即可满足农民需要。但当时供销社及私商存货却不足二百万斤（供销社有肥一百三十万斤）。在这样的情况下，我们并没有事先计划到外埠运来肥料调剂市场，而采取向供销社购买和直接贷款给农民向私商购买（贷户向私商买妥后，到银行转账），这样就形成银行和群众抢购，以致肥价上涨。九月十七日供销社肥料已卖完，私商存货也不多了，银行乃决定贷款给私商到津、唐一带购买。而买回后，种麦季节已快过去了。
    贷款给私商不是采取请其代购的方式，而是由私商买回后，按市价向银行出贷。实际上当时的所谓“市价”是不合理的，市场只有行无市。农民为了贷到肥料，只好忍受着私商的高利剥削。至九月底肥价虽落到八万五、六千元，但这是因为种麦季节即将过去，商人急于求售，才使价格下落的。
    我们在这个工作中所犯的错误是没有深入了解情况，单纯的任务观点在作祟。如果银行能掌握五、六十万斤肥料，当时的肥价是不会超过八万元的。这表现了我们在工作上和群众观点的薄弱，今后我们在工作中一定要记取这次教训，不再重犯。人民银行保定办事处给我们的警告处分，我们诚恳地接受。
                          中国人民银行望都支行
