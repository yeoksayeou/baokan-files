　　Glorious Tasks to Greet 1951
    Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party

    Today is New Year's Day, 1951, the second New Year's Day of the People's Republic of China. The people of the whole country are greeting this happy New Year with fervent excitement and joyful encouragement, and are accepting with a solemn attitude the sacred and great struggle tasks that 1951 bestows upon us.

    Let us look back on the past year! 1950 was a year of great victory and rapid progress for the Chinese people. In this year, the Chinese people completed the liberation of the mainland of the country, with the exception of Taiwan, which is still to be liberated, and Tibet, which is in the process of being liberated. They expelled the forces of imperialism, and destroyed the rule of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism. In foreign affairs, they established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and 16 other countries, and concluded a treaty with the Soviet Union for friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance. On the basis of this victory of the people's revolution, the people of the whole country launched vigorous reforms and construction work in the political, economic, and cultural fields. After a year of efforts, Chinese history has undergone more significant changes and progress than in the past thousands of years; the old face of China is rapidly disappearing, and the new people's China has grown strong.

    The birth and growth of New China, and the victory and progress of the Chinese people, are due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Chairman Mao. The people of the whole country must consolidate and develop this foundation of victory, and further strengthen it, building a strong fortress to defend world peace and the construction of the motherland. Because the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is frantically invading Korea and invading our country's Taiwan, seriously threatening our country's security and world peace, it has aroused the anger of the Chinese people. In order to protect our homes and defend our country, and to defend peaceful construction, the people of the whole country are launching a vigorous movement to resist America and aid Korea, and are actively participating in this sacred and just struggle mission as volunteers, and giving the invading American army a severe blow!

    Today is the beginning of 1951. The primary and important task before us is to carry out land reform in a step-by-step and orderly manner, so that the vast number of peasants can stand up, become masters of their own affairs in the countryside, and thereby liberate rural productive forces and pave the way for the industrialization of New China. At the same time, the broad masses of peasants are freed from the shackles of the landlords and gain emancipation. We must dedicate ourselves to our government with boundless loyalty and inexhaustible manpower and financial resources, and strive to defend peace and defend our motherland.

    The reactionary ruling clique of American imperialism will never learn its lesson from the failure on the Korean battlefield, and will never stop its aggression. It will inevitably expand its war of aggression with even more frantic actions. It is now preparing this evil conspiracy. The people of the whole country must heighten their vigilance, closely watch the conspiracy activities of American imperialism, and resolutely strike them down. Therefore, the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country is a solemn, sacred, and long-term arduous task. In addition to continuing to eliminate bandits and secret agents on the mainland and strengthening "anti-raid" and "anti-infiltration" work, we must also mobilize the vast number of young students, workers, and peasants to actively participate in military cadre schools, establish a strong national defense army, and protect the security of the motherland. At the same time, on the basis of the nationwide people's volunteer effort to resist America and aid Korea, we must extensively carry out practical actions, and continue to actively and tirelessly provide full assistance to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army until the American imperialists are driven out of Korea and Taiwan, and driven out of Asia. Similarly, construction work in the political, economic, and cultural fields must be further improved to make the motherland even stronger. Let the imperialists tremble before our victory. We have enough strength to defend the security of our motherland and to defend world peace.

    This is the sacred task that 1951 has given us. We should accept this great task with a solemn and joyful mood! And strive to complete it quickly and victoriously!

　　迎接一九五一年的光荣任务
    中国致公党中央委员会主席陈其尤
    今天是一九五一年的元旦，是中华人民共和国成立的第二个元旦，全国人民都以热烈兴奋和欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接这愉快的新年，并以庄严的态度来接受一九五一年给予我们神圣的伟大的斗争任务。
    让我们回顾过去的一年吧！一九五○年是中国人民伟大胜利和迅速进步的一年。在这一年中，中国人民在国内除台湾尚待解放和西藏正在解放中外，完成了全国大陆的解放，驱逐了帝国主义的势力，摧毁了封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，在国外与苏联等十七个国家建立了外交关系，并与苏联订立了友好同盟互助条约。在这样人民革命胜利的基础之上，全国人民在政治、经济、和文化各方面展开了蓬蓬勃勃的改革和建设工作，经过了这一年的努力，中国的历史已经比过去几千年经历了更重大的变化和进步；旧面貌的中国正在迅速地消失，新的人民的中国已经坚强地生长起来了。
    新中国的诞生和成长，中国人民的胜利和进步，是由于中国共产党和人民领袖毛主席的英明领导而获致的。全国人民必须把这个胜利基础由巩固而发展，和进一步的壮大起来，筑成一座保卫世界和平、保卫祖国建设的坚强堡垒。由于以美国为首的帝国主义者集团疯狂地侵略朝鲜和侵略我国的台湾，严重地威胁着我国的安全和世界的和平，激起了中国人民的愤怒，为着保家卫国、为着保卫和平建设，全国人民正在轰轰烈烈地掀起了抗美援朝的运动，纷纷以志愿行动来参加这一神圣的正义的斗争任务，并给予侵朝的美军严重的打击！
    今天是一九五一年的开始，摆在我们面前首要的重大工作就是要有步骤地、有秩序地进行土地改革、使广大农民得以翻身，在农村中当家作主，借以解放农村生产力，为新中国的工业化开辟道路。同时广大的农民解脱了地主的束缚，获得翻身。我们必以无限的忠诚，无穷的人力和财力，献给自己的政府，为保卫和平、保卫祖国而奋斗。
    美帝国主义反动的统治集团，在朝鲜战场的失败，是决不会接受教训的，是决不会停止侵略的。它必然地会以更疯狂的行动来扩大侵略战争，它现在正准备着这一罪恶的阴谋，我们全国人民必须提高警惕密切注视美帝国主义的阴谋活动，并予以坚决的打击。因此，抗美援朝保家卫国的运动是庄严神圣又是长期的艰巨的工作。我们除了要继续肃清大陆上的土匪特务，加强“防袭”“防钻”工作外，并且要发动广大青年学生、工农群众积极参加军事干部学校，建立强大的国防军，保卫祖国的安全，同时在全国人民抗美援朝的志愿基础上，把实际行动广泛的展开起来，继续不断地，积极不懈地予中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军全力的援助，直至把美帝国主义者驱逐出朝鲜台湾去，驱逐出亚洲去。同样的在政治、经济和文化各方面的建设工作，要进一步提高起来，把祖国建设得更强大。让帝国主义者在我们的胜利面前发抖吧。我们有足够的力量保卫祖国的安全和保卫世界的和平。
    这是一九五一年给予我们神圣的任务，我们应以庄严愉快的心情来接受这一伟大的任务！并为迅速地胜利完成它而斗争！
