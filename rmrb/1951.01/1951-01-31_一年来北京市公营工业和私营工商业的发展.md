　　The Development of State-Owned Industry and Private Industry and Commerce in Beijing in the Past Year
　　Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government
    In the past year, the Chinese people have achieved great successes on the economic front, which has also brought profound changes to the economic life of the people in our capital, Beijing. As a result of the central government's implementation of unified financial and economic management, the situation of malignant inflation over the past twelve years has been reversed, and prices have completely stabilized since March. Hoarding and speculation have been hit, and those receiving fixed wages no longer have to worry about not being able to buy goods with their wages, and manufacturers no longer have to worry about not being able to exchange their products for raw materials. Last December, Beijing's overall price index rose by only 90 percent compared to the previous December, and the December price index was even lower than that of March. This completely changed the situation of 1949, when prices fluctuated four times a year and rose by 37 times, and is completely different from the situation after the Kuomintang issued the bogus gold yuan, when prices rose by an average of 97 times in five months.
    Balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure and ensuring the supply of materials to stabilize prices is the result of the improvement of the economic situation, and the stability of prices has become an important condition for the development of production.
    In 1950, we saw great development in both state-owned industry and private industry and commerce.
  (1) State-Owned Industry
    The state-owned industry referred to here refers to the industry run by the Beijing Municipality, which accounts for only a small part of the state-owned industry in Beijing. In the past year, due to the investment of new capital by the Municipal People's Government (80 percent of which was used for capital construction), two new business units and one new factory were added, and five factories expanded important production equipment.
    In terms of the number of employees, 1950 increased by 59 percent compared to 1949, and 155 percent compared to the time of takeover.
    The expansion of production equipment and the increase in the number of employees indicate the expansion of the scale of production, and the expansion is very rapid.
    The increase in output can be illustrated by the following figures:
    The average monthly output in 1950 compared to 1949 increased by 61.7 percent for flour, 64.3 percent on average for various major products of the woolen mill, 98.9 percent for paper making, 83.2 percent for glass products, 387.3 percent for pharmaceuticals, 89.7 percent for kiln industry, and 65.8 percent for matches.
    If we compare the average monthly output of 1950 with the monthly output during the Kuomintang rule, the military blankets of the Qinghe Woolen Mill exceeded 56 percent, the paper making of the Yanjing Paper Mill exceeded 139 percent, and the glass products of the New Construction Glass Factory exceeded 200 percent.
    What does this mean? This shows that the increase in output of our municipal factories in the past year was very large, and the productivity of the same factory in the hands of the people has increased significantly compared to that in the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    After the widespread launch of the production competition campaign to improve quality and reduce costs, the improvement of production efficiency and the improvement of quality were also significant. For example, in the Qinghe Woolen Mill, the production efficiency of each combing machine in December increased by 100 percent compared to January. The grinding amount of steel mills in the New Construction Flour Mill increased by 76 percent in December compared to January. In terms of quality, the ratio of first-class products in the Qinghe Woolen Mill (woolen fabric department) was 49.6 percent in July, reaching 95.4 percent in December, and the cotton fabric department was 98 percent in July, reaching 99.6 percent in November. The Yanjing Paper Mill originally planned a paper loss rate of 8 percent, which was reduced to 6.54 percent in the production competition.
    From the production competition campaign, it can be seen that once the working class becomes conscious and recognizes its position as the master of production, it shows a high degree of production enthusiasm, and its creativity is amazing. Implementing democratic management in factories and launching production competition campaigns on the basis of democratic management are important links to achieving cost reduction, quality improvement, and output increase.
  (2) Private Industry and Handicraft Industry
    After the unified financial and economic management in March and the stabilization of prices, private industry and handicraft industry encountered temporary difficulties due to the cessation of false purchasing power and the sluggish sales of goods, but they were quickly overcome due to our adjustment of industry and commerce. And due to the continuous stability of prices, the autumn harvest, and the continued expansion of urban and rural trade, private industry and handicraft industry continued to recover and develop.
    In the past year, the actual increase in private industrial enterprises after offsetting openings and closings in twenty-one industries was 1,623 households and 5,639 employees. The number of households at the end of 1950 increased by 32.2 percent compared to the end of 1949, and the number of employees increased by 18.8 percent. The actual increase in handicraft enterprises after offsetting openings and closings was 1,130 households and 3,347 employees. The number of households at the end of 1950 increased by 21.5 percent compared to the end of 1949, and the number of employees increased by 25.5 percent. The actual increase in specialized handicraft enterprises after offsetting openings and closings was 676 households and 2,114 employees. A total of 3,429 households and 11,200 employees were added to private industry, handicraft industry, and specialized handicraft industry in 1950.
    Among the industries, the largest increase in the number of households was in the machine iron industry, smelting industry, weaving and dyeing industry, knitting industry, and chemical industry.
    In terms of machinery and equipment, many industries have increased, such as the flour industry increasing single-type flour milling machines by 64.3 percent, the knitting industry increasing electric motors by 48.42 percent, the printing industry increasing 32-page machines by 25 percent, and the electric saw timber industry increasing electric saws by about one time.
    From the perspective of output, the output of most industries in 1950 exceeded the production level of 1949. To give a few examples, flour exceeded 51.2 percent; various fabrics exceeded 70.6 percent; matches exceeded 34.6 percent; knitted socks exceeded 132.3 percent. The output of other iron industries, leather making, kiln industry, rubber industry, cigarette making, and oil extraction industry also increased greatly compared to 1949. According to the statistics of 20 private industries in 1950, the total value of their production was approximately 506 million catties of millet, exceeding 70.5 percent of the total production value in 1949.
    In the handicraft industry, according to incomplete statistics, the output in 1950 also exceeded the output in 1949: In the export industry, the pig bristle industry increased by 70 percent, the lambskin rug increased by more than four times, and the glass material industry increased by about 20 percent; In industries mainly sold to rural areas, large carts and hand carts increased by 70 percent, measuring and weighing instruments increased by 30 percent, and other items such as toothbrushes increased by 30 percent.
    The above materials can illustrate that the scale, equipment, and output of private industry and handicraft industry have all developed greatly in 1950.
    The development of industry can also be seen from the increase in industrial electricity consumption. The total amount of industrial electricity consumption in 1950 (including state-owned and private) increased by 34.6 percent compared to 1949.
    In addition, private industry has also made certain achievements in improving quality and reducing costs. For example, the flour, soap making, and rubber industries have organized technical research associations to exchange experiences and improve technology. For example, the moisture content of flour has been reduced from 15 percent to 13 percent after research, which has improved the quality of flour and prolonged the storage time. Another example is that the Nanyang Factory in the soap industry has gone from re-boiling each pot of soap 15 times to not re-boiling, and the consumption time has been reduced from 14 hours to 8 hours. The amount of coal used has been reduced from 400 catties to 250 catties, thereby reducing the cost of each box of soap by 5,000 yuan, and the output has increased from 300 boxes to 800 boxes per month. Due to the finished product inspection of eight industries including soap, knitting, cigarettes, matches, platform scales, leather, machine oil, and caustic soda, the specifications of the finished products have been stipulated, and inspection has been strengthened in processing orders, thereby improving the quality of the finished products in various industries and restricting shoddy manufacturing. The residual matches in the match industry have been reduced from 30 percent to 9 percent, and the cloth return rate of the flower yarn cloth company has been reduced from 30 percent to 5 percent.
  (3) Commerce
    Private commerce experienced a temporary recession when prices fell in March, and the number of closures once increased. According to statistics, the actual decrease in the first half of the year after offsetting openings and closures was 900 households. However, due to the adjustment of industry and commerce, the bumper harvest in rural areas, and the expansion of urban and rural trade, it quickly entered a period of prosperity in the second half of the year. The actual increase in the second half of the year after offsetting openings and closings was 1,635 households, and the actual increase for the whole year was 735 households.
    In terms of turnover, according to a partial statistical material from the Municipal Tax Bureau's collection of business tax, the turnover of general industries increased by more than one time in winter compared to spring. The turnover of several major industries increased in winter compared to spring as follows: the silk and cloth industry increased by 180 percent for 132 households, the department store industry increased by 154 percent for 423 households, the hotel industry increased by 119 percent for 171 households, the hardware industry increased by 307 percent for 80 households, and the timber industry increased by 399 percent for 91 households. And the turnover of industries that will be gradually eliminated, such as the incense and candle industry, decreased by 73 percent.
    This shows that the overall trend of private commerce in the past year was development, especially after autumn, the development was very large, and only a very small number of industries that did not meet the needs of the people declined.

　　一年来北京市公营工业和私营工商业的发展
    北京市人民政府财政经济委员会副主任  程宏毅
    在去年这一年当中，我们中国人民在经济战线上取得了伟大的成绩，在我们的首都北京人民的经济生活当中也引起了深刻的变化。由于中央实行统一财经管理的结果，扭转了十二年来恶性通货膨胀的局面，使物价从三月份以后完全稳定下来，囤积居奇投机倒把的受到了打击，领取定额工资的人再也不必耽心领到的工资买不到东西，厂商也不必耽心出品销售之后换不回原料来。去年十二月较前年十二月北京市的物价总指数上涨不过百分之九十，而且十二月份的物价指数较三月份还低。完全改变了一九四九年度一年波动四次，物价上涨三十七倍的形势，更与国民党发行伪金圆券以后五个月中间物价平均上涨了九十七倍的情况完全是两个世界。
    平衡财政收支，保证物资供应，以稳定物价是经济情况好转的结果，而物价的稳定又成为生产向前发展的一个重要条件。
    一九五○年度我们在公营工业和私营工商业方面都有了很大的发展。
  （一）公营工业
    这里所说的公营工业是指北京市营的工业，仅占北京市公营工业中的一小部分。在去年一年当中，由于市人民政府投下了新的资本（其中百分之八十用于基本建设），所以新增加了两个企业单位和一个新厂，有五个厂扩充了重要的生产设备。
    在职工人数方面一九五○年较一九四九年增加了百分之五十九，较接管时期增加了百分之一百五十五。
    生产设备的扩充和职工人数的增加，说明了生产规模的扩大，而且扩大得很快。
    在产量方面的增加可以举出下面的数字：
    一九五○年较一九四九年的月平均产量，面粉增加百分之六一·七，制呢厂各项主要产品平均增加百分之六四·三，造纸增加百分之九八·九，玻璃制品增加百分之八三·二，制药增加百分之三八七·三，窑业增加百分之八九·七，火柴增加百分之六五·八。
    如果以一九五○年的平均月产量和国民党统治的时期的月产量相比较，清河制呢厂的军毯超过百分之五十六，燕京纸厂的造纸超过百分之一三九，新建玻璃厂的玻璃制品超过百分之二○○。
    这说明什么呢？这说明在去年这一年的我们的市营各厂的产量增加是很大的，而且同一工厂在人民手里比在国民党反动派手里生产力有显著的增加。
    在广泛地开展了提高质量减低成本的生产竞赛运动之后，生产效率的提高，质量的改善，也很显著。例如清河制呢厂，每台梳毛车的生产效率十二月份比一月份提高了百分之一○○，新建面粉厂钢磨的磨面量，十二月份比一月份提高了百分之七十六，在质量方面，清河制呢厂一等品所占的比率（毛织部）在七月份是百分之四九·六，十二月份达到了百分之九五·四，棉织部七月份是百分之九八，十一月份达到了百分之九九·六。燕京造纸厂，原计划损纸率百分之八，在生产竞赛中减少到百分之六·五四。
    从生产竞赛运动中可以看出工人阶级一旦觉悟起来，认识到在生产当中的主人翁的地位以后，就表现出高度的生产积极性，其所发挥的创造力是惊人的。在工厂中实行民主管理，并在民主管理的基础上展开生产竞赛运动，是达到降低成本，提高质量，增加产量的重要环节。
  （二）私营工业和手工业
    私营工业和手工业在三月份统一财经管理，物价稳定后，由于虚假购买力的停止，商品滞销，曾遭到了暂时的困难，但是由于我们调整了工商业的结果，迅即克服。并由于物价持续的稳定，秋后丰收，城乡贸易继续扩大，私营工业和手工业都是继续恢复和发展的。
    在去年一年中，私营工业二十一个行业开歇业相抵后实际增加了一六二三户，职工五、六三九人，一九五○年底较一九四九年底户数增加了百分之三二·二，职工人数增加了百分之一八·八。手工业开歇业相抵后实际增加了一、一三○户，三、三四七人，一九五○年底较一九四九年底户数增加了百分之二一·五，职工人数增加了百分之二五·五。特种手工业开歇业相抵后实际增加了六七六户，职工二、一一四人。私营工业，手工业和特种手工业合计在一九五○年当中共增加了三、四二九户，职工一一、二○○人。
    在工业中户数增加最多的是机器铁工业，冶制业，织染业，针织业和化学工业。
    在机器设备方面，许多行业都有增加，如面粉业单式制粉机增加百分之六四·三，针织业电动机增加了百分之四八·四二，印刷业三十二页机增加了百分之二五，电锯制材业的电锯增加约达一倍。
    从产量方面看，一九五○年大部行业的产量都超过了一九四九年的生产水平，举几个例子，如面粉超过百分之五一·二；各种布超过百分之七○·六；火柴超过百分之三四·六；针织业的袜子超过百分之一三二·三，其他铁工业，制革业，窑业，橡胶业，卷烟，榨油业产量均较一九四九年有很大的增加。根据一九五○年私营工业二十个行业的统计，其生产总值约值五亿零六百余万斤小米，超过一九四九年生产总值的百分之七○·五。
    在手工业方面，根据不完全的统计，一九五○年的产量也超过了一九四九年的产量：出口的行业如猪鬃业增加百分之七○，羊腿皮褥增加四倍多，料器业增加百分之二十左右；主要销售于农村的行业，大车、手车增加百分之七○，度量衡器材增加百分之三十，其他如牙刷增加百分之三○。
    以上这些材料可以说明私营工业和手工业的生产的规模、设备和产量在一九五○年都有了很大的发展。
    从工业用电量的增加方面也可以看出工业的发展，一九五○年工业用电的总量（包括公营和私营）较一九四九年增加了百分之三四·六。
    此外，私营工业在提高质量降低成本方面，也有了一定的成绩。如面粉、造胰、橡胶等业组织了技术研究会，以交流经验，改进技术。如面粉的含水量经过研究后已由百分之一五降低到百分之一三，面粉的质量提高了并能延长存储时间。又如肥皂业的南洋工厂每锅肥皂由回锅十五次到不回锅，消耗时间由十四小时减到八小时。用煤量由四○○斤减到二五○斤，因而使每箱肥皂的成本减低了五、○○○元，产量由每月三百箱增加到八百箱。由于进行了肥皂、针织、卷烟、火柴、台秤、皮革、机油、火碱等八个行业的成品检验，规定了成品的规格，并且在加工定货中加强了检查，因而提高了各业的成品质量，限制了粗制滥造。火柴业的残火柴由百分之三○减低到百分之九，花纱布公司加工布的退布率由百分之三○降到百分之五。
  （三）商业
    私营商业在三月份物价下跌的时候，曾经表现了暂时的萧条，歇业的曾一度增多，据统计前半年开歇业相抵实际减少了九百户。但是后半年由于调整工商业的结果，由于农村的丰收，城乡贸易的扩大，很快地就进入了繁荣的阶段，下半年开歇业相抵实际增加了一千六百三十五户，全年实际增加了七百三十五户。
    在营业额方面，根据市税局征收营业税的一部分材料统计，一般行业营业额冬季比春季增加一倍以上，几个主要行业营业额冬季比春季增加如下：绸布业一三二户增加百分之一八○，百货业四二三户增加百分之一五四，旅店业一七一户增加百分之一一九，五金业八○户增加百分之三○七，木业九一户增加百分之三九九。而势将逐渐淘汰的行业如香烛业的营业额则减少了百分之七三。
    这说明私营商业在去年一年当中总的趋势是发展的，特别是秋后，发展很大，只有极少数不合人民需要的行业没落了。
