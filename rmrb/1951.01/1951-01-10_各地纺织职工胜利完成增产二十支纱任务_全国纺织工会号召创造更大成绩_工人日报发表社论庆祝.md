　　Textile Workers in Various Regions Successfully Complete the Task of Increasing Production of 20-Count Yarn
    National Textile Workers' Union Calls for Creating Greater Achievements
    Worker's Daily Publishes Editorial to Celebrate
    [Our Dispatch] After the staff and workers of state-owned and private cotton textile factories across the country successively overfulfilled the task of a crash program to increase production of 20-count yarn by the end of last November, Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, wrote a letter to the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China on December 25 to express his congratulations and awarded a bonus of 500 million yuan as a collective welfare fund for textile workers. In his letter, Director Chen Yun called on all trade union cadres of the Textile Workers' Union of China to "continue to work hard, lead all textile workers to strive to increase production, reduce costs, strengthen the country's economic strength, and improve the lives of all people and the working class!" The National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China held its second plenary meeting on December 26 and adopted the "Resolution on the Bonus Issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government." The resolution called on all textile workers and union cadres to respond to the government's care and encouragement with even greater effort, to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, to study actively, to further launch patriotic production campaigns, and to strive to create greater achievements in completing the 1951 production plan. In addition to stipulating that this bonus should be used as a collective welfare fund for textile workers and staff across the country, the resolution also called on textile union organizations at all levels to save more on expenses, and on the basis of the savings and this fund, prepare to establish a national sanatorium for textile workers to improve the health of employees and better fulfill the country's production tasks.
    The Worker's Daily, the organ of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, published an editorial on January 8 entitled "Celebrating the Victory of Textile Workers in the Crash Program to Increase Production of 20-Count Yarn." The editorial pointed out three important reasons for overfulfilling the task of the crash program to increase production of 20-count yarn: "This victory fully demonstrates the high level of class consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of textile workers across the country. Workers and staff understand how to contribute all their strength, with a master's attitude towards labor, to launch patriotic production campaigns for the needs of the motherland and for the interests of the entire working class and all the people. Therefore, this crash program to increase production has become a completely national, mass, and conscious movement. The original decision to increase production mainly involved state-owned cotton textile factories in various regions, but due to the soaring production enthusiasm of the workers and staff, private cotton textile factories in Wuhan, Northwest China, and East China also automatically joined the movement. The worker brothers in these private factories have long suffered from the difficulties of work stoppages and waiting for materials. Therefore, when they heard about the crash program to increase production, many workers jumped for joy, because it was from this task that they saw the bright and promising future of the country's textile industry. The wage system in textile enterprises was originally extremely unreasonable, but workers in Shanghai and other places said: "For the needs of our farmer brothers, the crash program to increase production is the most important thing. We can't worry about these things now." Many workers were unwilling to rest even when they were sick. During the movement, the workers and staff showed a high degree of initiative and creativity. Workers in Tianjin created a steel wire mutual-aid yarn removing method, reducing the stopping time of yarn removing by 54.7 percent, solving the difficulty of insufficient supply. Workers at Shanghai State-owned Cotton Factory No. 2 created a national record of 1.22 pounds of 20-count yarn per spindle in 24 hours. The crash production program fully demonstrates that as long as the workers' class consciousness is awakened, then the awakened workers and staff have endless creative talents. This is the basic driving force for this over-completion of the crash production task.
    "The over-completion of the crash program to increase production is also due to the fact that cotton textile factories have accepted the experience of the crash production in March of last year, correctly implemented the instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, reasonably paid wages, and appropriately paid attention to the labor protection of workers, so that the country's crash production task and the daily interests of workers are combined. All workers who participated in the crash program received not only 150% of their original wages, but also nutritional subsidies. Factories in Tianjin bought nutritious items such as apples, eggs, and biscuits to give to the workers. The factory trade unions and administrations also tried their best to take care of pregnant women and workers with weak health, stipulating that they could not participate in the crash program. Family work was strengthened to ensure that workers ate well and slept well when they returned home. Therefore, after receiving the task, the workers generally excitedly said: "The People's Government is as close to us as our relatives, caring for us in every way. Not only do they give us more money, but they also care about our health when we go home. We must work hard to complete this task." This not only further improved the enthusiasm of the workers, but also guaranteed the health of the workers, preventing the increase of sick and absent workers, thereby promoting the smooth completion of the production task.
    "In this crash program to increase production, textile union organizations at all levels, especially grassroots organizations, cooperated more closely with the administration to carry out in-depth and meticulous mobilization and organization work. After receiving the instructions from the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, trade union organizations in various regions immediately carried out in-depth publicity and mobilization among the broad masses of workers through various methods. Tianjin also printed publicity outlines and put forward publicity slogans. Tianjin and Qingdao also organized workers who did not participate in the crash program to write letters of condolences to the workers who did participate, perform dramas, send comfort items, send congratulatory words, and send banners to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses and make them realize the glory of participating in the crash program. In Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao and other places, some grassroots trade union chairmen and vice-chairmen went deep into the workshops and took turns on duty at night. The cadres took the lead and drove the entire staff to turn the requirements of the state into the conscious actions of the masses. Most of the problems that occurred in the crash program were solved jointly by the trade union and the administrative or capitalist aspects of the enterprise after joint research and unified decision. For example, the biggest difficulty in the Tianjin crash program to produce 20-count yarn was the yarn reeling capacity. After joint discussion by the trade union and the administration, the administration was responsible for allocating yarn reeling equipment, and the workers organized a challenge competition for maintenance workers to install machines and rush to install yarn reeling machines, and the yarn reeling equipment capacity was quickly solved. In this crash program to increase production, the overall leadership was consistent, and the leadership and the masses were closely combined, which is an important key to the over-completion of the task." The editorial finally called on the National Textile Workers' Union and all cadres of the Textile Workers' Union to "work harder, never be arrogant or complacent, make persistent efforts, actively study, improve technical and business levels, improve production, reduce costs, consolidate the gains, further launch patriotic production campaigns, and strive to overfulfill the 1951 production task."

　　各地纺织职工胜利完成增产二十支纱任务
    全国纺织工会号召创造更大成绩
    工人日报发表社论庆祝
    【本报讯】全国各地公私营棉纺织厂职工，于去年十一月底先后超额完成突击增产二十支纱的任务后，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会主任陈云，为此曾于十二月二十五日写信给中国纺织工会全国委员会表示祝贺，并颁发奖金五亿元，作为举办纺织工人集体福利基金。陈云主任在信中号召中国纺织工会全体工会工作干部“继续努力工作，领导全体纺织工人为提高生产，减低成本，为增强国家经济力量，为改善全体人民和工人阶级生活而奋斗！”中国纺织工会全国委员会于十二月二十六日举行第二次全体会议，曾通过“关于中央人民政府政务院财经委员会发给奖金的决议”。决议中号召全体纺织职工和工会干部对政府这样的关怀与鼓励，必须更加努力，戒骄戒燥，积极学习，进一步展开爱国主义生产竞赛，争取为完成一九五一年生产计划而创造更大的成绩。决议中除规定将这一奖金作为全国纺织工人、职员的集体福利基金外，并号召纺织工会各级组织更加节省经费开支，以经费的节余和这一基金为基础，准备创办全国纺织工人疗养院，以增进职工健康，更好地完成国家的生产任务。
    全国总工会机关报《工人日报》于一月八日，发表社论“庆祝纺织职工突击增产二十支纱的胜利”。社论中指出了超额完成突击增产二十支纱的三个重要原因：“这个胜利充分表现了全国纺织职工的高度的阶级觉悟和爱国热情。工人、职员们懂得，为了祖国的需要，为了整个工人阶级和全体人民的利益，如何贡献出自己全部力量，以主人翁的劳动态度，展开爱国主义的生产竞赛。因此，这次突击增产就完全成了全国性的群众自觉的运动。原来决定突击增产主要是各地国营棉纺织工厂，但因职工群众生产热情的高涨，武汉、西北、华东各地私营棉纺织工厂也都自动地卷入到这个运动中来。这些私营厂的工人兄弟，长期遭到停工待料的困难，因此一听到要突击增产时，许多工人都高兴地蹦了起来，因为正是从这次突击增产的任务中，他们看到了国家纺织工业光明远大的发展前途。纺织企业中的工资制度本来极不合理，但上海等地的工人都说：“为了农民兄弟的需要，突击增产要紧，现在可顾不得这些了。”许多工人有病也不肯休息。运动中，职工群众发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。天津的工人创造了钢丝互助抄车法，减少抄车的停车时间百分之五十四·七，解决了供应不上的困难。上海国棉二厂职工创造了二十支纱二十小时锭产一·二二磅的全国空前纪录。突击增产运动充分说明：只要启发了职工的阶级自觉，那么，觉悟了的职工群众是蕴藏着无穷无尽的创造才能的。这就是这次超额完成突击增产任务的基本动力。
    “突击增产任务的超额完成，还由于各棉纺织工厂接受了去年三月突击生产的经验，正确地执行了中央财经委员会的指示，合理地发给工资和适当注意职工的劳动保护，使国家的突击增产任务和职工日常利益结合一致。所有参加突击加点的工人，除领到原工资百分之一百五十的加点工资外，并领到营养补贴费，天津各厂都买成苹果、鸡蛋、饼干之类的营养品送给工人。各厂工会与行政又尽量照顾孕妇和身体弱的职工，规定他们可以不参加突击。加强了家属工作，保证工人回家吃的好睡的好。因此，职工在接到任务后，普遍兴奋地说：“人民政府同咱们亲人一样，处处体贴咱，不但多给工钱，回家还关心咱们的健康，咱们要努力完成这个任务。”这样，不仅更加提高了职工生产积极性，同时也保障了职工身体的健康，防止了病号和欠勤的增加，从而促成了增产任务的顺利完成。
    “在这次突击增产运动中，纺织工会各级组织特别是基层组织，更密切配合行政，进行了深入细致的动员工作和组织工作。各地工会组织在接到中国纺织工会全国委员会的指示以后，立即通过各种方法向广大职工群众进行了深入的宣传动员，天津还印发了宣传提纲，提出了宣传口号；天津、青岛都组织了没有参加突击加点的工人，给加点的工人写慰问信、演剧、送慰劳品、送祝词、送锦旗，鼓舞了群众的生产热情，使他们体会到突击加点的光荣。上海、天津、青岛等地有些基层组织的工会主席和副主席，更深入车间，夜里还分工值班，干部领头带动了全体职工群众，把国家的要求变成了群众的自觉行动。突击增产中所发生的问题，大多是经过工会和企业的行政方面或资方共同研究，统一决定后协同解决的。如天津突击二十支纱，最大的困难是摇纱能力问题，经工会和行政共同讨论后，即由行政负责调配摇纱设备，工人则组织装置机器的保全工人挑战竞赛，突击按装摇纱机，摇纱设备能力随即迅速解决。在这次突击增产运动中整个领导是一致的，领导和群众也是紧密结合着的，这就是这次超额完成任务的一个重要关键。”社论最后号召全国纺织工会和纺织工会全体干部“更加努力，决不骄傲自满，再接再厉，积极学习，提高技术业务水平，改进生产，减低成本，巩固既得胜利，进一步展开爱国主义生产竞赛，争取超额完成一九五一年的生产任务。”
