    So-Called "Ace" Troops of the American Empire
    Collective Writing by Frontline Reporters and Correspondents

    I. The "Ace" Troops Vaunted by the Americans

    Among all the troops of the imperialist aggressors in Korea, the 1st Marine Division of the United States Navy can be regarded as the so-called "ace" force with the longest history, the best equipment, and the strongest combat effectiveness.

    U.S. imperialism once touted its "elite" force: "It has a history of 175 years of military establishment, has gone abroad four times, and has never lost a battle." When this Marine Corps was sent to Korea last year to carry out a barbaric war of aggression, Miller, a reporter for the reactionary American news agency United Press, wrote wildly in a message issued on August 6: "These troops have the best qualities typical of the American army, and their equipment is the best seen in the Korean War. Their training is the most arduous of the troops sent here. ... If the Communists can defeat this group, then they have won the war in Korea and perhaps even the war in the whole world, because this group is the most elite and the best of our army. These Marines admit that they may be defeated one day - yes, if the sun rises from the west." However, the sun did not rise from the west, and this so-called elite "ace" force of the American invading army, with the longest qualifications, was soundly defeated.

    The following records are some fragments of this so-called "ace" force of the U.S. invasion of Korea, which was relentlessly fought by our Chinese and Korean people's forces all the way from the Changjin Lake to the Hamhung coast, until it was defeated miserably with helmets and armor discarded, and corpses left behind.

    II. Where to Hide

    November 27 was the fourth day after MacArthur dreamed of rapidly occupying the entire Korean Peninsula and launching a so-called "general offensive." A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the eastern front, after continuous arduous marching, without even having time to bring up light artillery, rapidly and bravely surrounded the 5th and 7th Regiments of the 1st Marine Division of the United States Navy in the Liutanli area west of Changjin Lake on the same night.

    On the third day of the battle, three or four hundred enemies were compressed by a certain regiment of the People's Volunteer Army into a small ditch in front of the position. The machine guns of the Volunteer Army shot the enemies scurrying back and forth, and the white snow in the gully was trampled all over by them. These soldiers later simply sat down dejectedly, some lying on the snow, and some staring blankly at the blue sky. Chen Cide, a machine gunner of the Volunteer Army, came with a burst of pinpoint shooting, and the sitting and lying enemies, like a swarm of startled flies, scurried away in a panic. Dozens of people ran to hide under a truck on the road. Some burrowed into the snow caves beside the road, trying to cover their bodies with white snow. Some bumped their heads east and west, and some scurried around in groups of three or five, causing disturbances for a long time before calming down. The Volunteer Army fighters fired a volley of guns, and suddenly fired a few shots from 60mm mortars, killing and wounding the group of soldiers gathered in the gully, and the rest just screamed and ran around, not knowing where to hide.

    III. Rout

    On December 2, the 1st Marine Division, which had been severely hit by the Chinese and Korean people's fighters in Liutanli, began to flee to Hagaru-ri. On the way from Liutanli to Hagaru-ri, less than sixty li, this defeated army crawled and scrambled for three days and three nights. Piles of corpses and wounded were left behind. The snow-covered battlefield was littered with cannons and tanks painted with white stars and the word "America." Long lines of trucks were crowded on the road, jeeps overturned in ditches, countless submachine guns, radios, officers' coats, and "Arctic sleeping bags" were scattered in the snow. The defeated soldiers fled to the frozen Changjin River, and there was only one bridge less than four meters wide on the river. Armored vehicles, cars, cannons, and small jeeps collided with each other on the bridge, shouting and cursing. Cars were overturned, and people were squeezed into the river. The American soldiers on both sides of the bridge heard the gunshots behind them getting closer and closer, and without waiting to cross the bridge, they scrambled to run onto the ice. Many people slipped on the ice, and after struggling to get up, they were knocked over by the people behind them. Some people ran dizzy to thin ice and fell into the river. Some did not have time to escape across the river and were shot through the head by the bullets of the Volunteer Army fighters, or were lucky enough to become prisoners.

    IV. Living Corpses

    The dim sky was filled with goose feather snow. Wang Jindou, the deputy squad leader of the 6th Squad of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, searched along the mountain road where the enemy had fled, and found two American corpses huddled tightly together in an air-raid shelter next to a stone cave, with no bloodstains. Wang Jindou, holding a Thompson submachine gun, shouted, "Come out!" The two corpses remained still. The deputy squad leader of the 6th Squad thought: Let's try shooting them twice. The Thompson submachine gun "whirred" as it was cocked, and the two corpses suddenly came to life, scrambling to get up and kneeling down to kowtow in a panic. Wang Jindou gestured, ordering them to stand up. The two guys who pretended to be dead were trembling, as if suffering from severe malaria. One patted his pockets and body, indicating that he had handed over his gun. The other quickly unbuttoned his coat and took out cigarettes and canned food. Wang Jindou waved his hand, refusing to accept. The two guys were like wooden chickens, motionless for a long time.

    These two living corpses belonged to the 7th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division of the United States Navy. Their names were Archie and Wilmarth.

    V. Cremating the Wounded

    On the fourth day after the battle began, the reporter followed a certain unit of our People's Volunteer Army along the winding road from Liutanli extending to the southeast, pursuing the remnants of the enemy fiercely. At a bend in the road, a burst of stench suddenly came. Crossing a small river beside the road, it was found that at the foot of the mountain next to a forest, a pile of charred corpses was gathered on a piece of ground 25 meters long and wide, some of which had been burned to ashes. Next to the rotten corpses, the corpse of an American soldier was still wriggling, his disheveled hair and legs were being burned. It was learned from the nearby Korean people that the 1st Marine Division of the United States Navy cremated more than two hundred American soldiers' corpses and wounded here before fleeing in a panic.

    In an area less than one kilometer ahead, more than one hundred American soldiers' corpses were found again. Among these corpses, some were only shot through a shoulder or a leg with a bullet, and could be healed with a short period of treatment. Obviously, these corpses were abandoned by the fleeing enemy, and thus the wounded soldiers were frozen to death alive. These American soldiers gave their lives in vain for the big bosses of Wall Street.

    VI. Herding Ducks into the Sea

    The 1st Marine Division, the 3rd Infantry Division, the 7th Infantry Division of the U.S. invading army, and the remnants of the Li Chengwan puppet army, totaling tens of thousands of people, were herded into the sea by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces from the banks of the Yalu River and from the shores of Changjin Lake like ducks.

    When the American invading army was finally compressed into a small area of ​​no more than twenty li in Xingnan Port, the American soldiers were in chaos, the soldiers lacked the will to fight, and they scrambled to escape to the warships. On the evening of December 21, a certain company of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army rushed into the enemy's position, threw a few grenades, and frightened the American soldiers so much that they did not dare to fire a single shot, and ran away, leaving behind rocket launchers, light and heavy machine guns, shells, and unopened boxes of carbine bullets. According to prisoners of war, the American soldiers hid in caves every night before they had time to escape, trembling and praying to "God." The black soldiers and the Li Chengwan puppet army were placed on the periphery as shields.

    Although American warships and planes were frantically transporting personnel and supplies day and night, the defeated army was still afraid of not being able to escape, so they threw a large number of tanks, trucks, ammunition, and food into the sea. In the end, they didn't even have time to throw them into the sea, so they set them on fire. When the reporter inspected the Xingnan Port area, the fire was still burning.

    VII. The End of the Battlefield "American Way of Life"

    In a fortification built by the U.S. Marine Corps on a hilltop, the reporter saw the corpse of an American soldier in his twenties. His right hand was holding a razor tightly, and not far from his left hand, there was a broken small mirror. His face was half smooth and purple, with frozen white foam, and the other half was still covered with shaggy whiskers. Under his face was a love letter from Japan. Not far from him, another photo was found. In the photo, he was naked, grasping the hair of a terrified Korean girl who had been stripped naked with his left hand, and pointing a short gun at the girl with his right hand, grinning hideously. Obviously, after carefully reading his love letter and admiring the photos of him venting his bestiality and insulting Korean girls, he felt that he was too ugly, so he began to shave his hairy face. However, just as he was shaving vigorously, the bullets of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army ended his battlefield "American way of life" and executed the people's justice judgment.

　　如此美帝“王牌”军
    前线记者与通讯员集体写作
    一、美国人所吹嘘的“王牌”军
    在帝国主义侵略朝鲜的所有部队中，美国的海军陆战队第一师要算是历史最长、装备最好、战斗力最强的所谓“王牌”军了。
    美帝国主义曾大事吹嘘它的这支“精锐”部队：“有一百七十五年建军历史，四次出国，从来没有打过败仗”。当去年这支海军陆战队派到朝鲜进行野蛮的侵略战争时，美国反动通讯社合众社记者密勒在八月六日发出的一条消息中，就曾狂妄地写道：“这些军队有着典型的美国军队最好的品质，他们的装备是在朝鲜战争中所见到的最好的。他们的训练是派遣到这里来的军队中最坚韧的。……如果共军能打败这一伙人，那么他们就已赢得朝鲜的战争甚至也许全世界的战争，因为这一伙人是我们军队中最精锐的和最优秀的。这些海军陆战队承认他们也许有一天会被打败——是的，如果那一天太阳从西边出的话。”但是，太阳并没有从西边出来，而美国侵略军中这个资格最老的所谓精锐“王牌”倒是结结实实地被打败了。
    下面记载的就是这支美国侵朝的所谓“王牌军”从长津湖畔到咸兴海岸，沿途被我中、朝人民部队节节扭打，直打得它丢盔曳甲，遗尸累累，狼狈惨败的一些断片。
  二、何处藏身
    十一月二十七日，是麦克阿瑟梦想迅速侵占全朝鲜，发动所谓“总攻势”之后的第四天。东线的中国人民志愿军某部经过连续的艰苦行军，连轻型炮都没有来得及带上去，就在当天晚上，迅速而勇猛地把美国海军陆战队第一师的第五和第七两个团，包围在长津湖西的柳潭里地区。
    战斗的第三天，三、四百名敌人被人民志愿军某团压缩在阵地前的小沟里。志愿军的机关枪把敌人打得来回乱窜，山沟里的白雪都被他们踏遍了。这些士兵后来就索性垂头丧气地坐着，有的躺在雪地上，有的呆呆地望着青天。志愿军的机关枪手陈辞德来了一阵点射，坐着的躺着的敌人，就像一群受惊的苍蝇，慌慌张张地四散逃命。好几十个人奔到公路上的一辆卡车底下躲起来。有的钻到公路旁的雪窖里，想让白雪把身体遮住。有的东碰一头，西碰一头，三、五成群，到处乱窜，骚扰了好久，才平息下来。志愿军的战士们打一阵排枪，突然又打几发六零炮，把这群麇集在山沟里的士兵，打得死的死伤的伤，剩下的只是乱叫乱跑，不知道何处藏身是好。
  三、溃逃
    十二月二日，在柳潭里受到中、朝人民战士沉重打击的陆战第一师开始向下碣隅里逃窜。在从柳潭里到下碣隅里不足六十华里的路途上，这支败兵就连滚带爬地走了三天三夜。成堆的尸体和伤员被丢了下来。白雪皑皑的战场上，丢满了涂着白色星徽和“美国”字样的大炮和坦克。卡车一长列一长列地拥塞在路上，吉普车翻倒在沟里，无数的冲锋枪、报话机、军官们穿的大衣，还有“北极睡袋”，四散在雪地里。败兵逃到冰冻的长津江边，江上只有一座宽不足四公尺的小桥。装甲车、汽车、大炮和小吉普车，在桥上互相撞击着，叫骂着。汽车被撞翻了，人被挤到江里去了。在桥两旁的美国兵们听到后面的枪声越来越近，等不得过桥，就争着向冰上跑去。很多人在冰上滑倒，好不容易爬起来，又被后面的人撞翻了身。有些人昏头昏脑地跑到冰薄的地方，坠入了江中。有的来不及逃过江，就被志愿军战士的子弹打穿了头颅，或者幸运地当了俘虏。
  四、活尸
    灰暗的天空，飘着鹅毛大雪。志愿军某部第六班副班长王金斗沿着敌人溃逃的山路搜索，在一处石洞旁的防空洞里，发现两具没有血迹、挤得紧紧的美军尸体。王金斗端着汤姆枪大喊一声：“出来！”两具尸体仍然不动。六班副想着：打他两枪试试看。汤姆枪“哗啦”一拉，这两具尸体忽然活啦，慌忙地爬起来，又慌忙跪下叩头。王金斗做个手势，命令他们站起来。这两个装死的家伙颤抖着，像患了严重的虐疾病。一个拍拍口袋和全身，表示他已经交了枪支。另一个连忙解开大衣拿出香烟和罐头。王金斗向他们摆摆手，拒绝接受。这两个家伙呆若木鸡，好久动也不动。
    这两个活死尸属于美海军陆战第一师第七团，他们的名字是阿尔契和威尔曼特。
  五、火葬伤兵
    战斗开始后的第四天，记者随我人民志愿军某部沿着柳潭里弯弯曲曲伸向东南的公路猛追残敌，在公路的一个转弯处，突然传来一阵阵的恶臭。跨过路旁一条小河，发现在山角下树林旁，在一片纵横二十五公尺的地面上，堆集着被烧焦的死尸，有的已烧成骨灰。在烂焦的尸体旁，有一具美国兵的尸体还在蠕动着，他的乱发和腿正被烧着。从附近的朝鲜老百姓口中知道，原来是美国海军陆战队第一师在慌忙逃跑前，在这里火葬了二百多具美国兵的尸体和伤兵。
    在向前不到一公里的地区内，又发现百余具美军尸体。在这些尸体中，有的只是肩膀上或腿上被穿过一颗子弹，只要经过短时间的治疗就可以医好。显然，这些尸体是被狼狈逃窜的敌人遗弃下来，因而活活冻死的伤兵。这些美国兵就这样替华尔街的大老板白白送了性命。
  六、赶鸭子下海
    美国侵略军海军陆战队第一师、步兵第三师、步兵第七师及李承晚伪军残部等数万人，像鸭子一样，被中、朝人民部队从鸭绿江边，从长津湖畔赶下了海。
    当美国侵略军最后被压缩在兴南港纵横不过二十里的狭小地区时，美国兵乱作一团，士无斗志，争向军舰逃命。十二月二十一日晚，中国人民志愿军某连冲入敌阵，打了几个手榴弹，吓得美国兵没有敢打一枪，撒腿就跑，丢下了火箭炮、轻重机枪、炮弹和原封未启的卡宾枪子弹箱。据俘虏说：美国兵在还没有来得及逃走之前，每夜都躲在山洞里，战战兢兢地向“上帝”祷告。而黑人士兵和李承晚伪军则被放在外围做挡箭牌。
    尽管美国的军舰、飞机日夜抢运人员、物资，但是溃军还怕逃不脱，于是就把大批坦克、卡车、弹药和粮食投入海里。最后，连投入海里的时间都来不及了，他们就放火焚烧。在记者巡视兴南港地区时，大火还在继续燃烧。
  七、战地“美国生活方式”的终结
    在山头上一个美国海军陆战队构筑的工事里，记者看见一个二十多岁的美国兵的尸体。他右手紧握着一把刮脸刀，离左手不远，有一面破碎的小镜。他的脸上，一面是光而发紫，并有冻结的白色泡沫，另一面还是毛茸茸的胡髭。脸下压着一封从日本寄来的情书。在他的身旁不远，又发现一张照片。照片中，他赤身露体，左手抓着一位被剥光衣服的吓得发呆的朝鲜姑娘的头发，右手拿着短枪对准这位姑娘，恶丑地狞笑着。显然，这是他在仔细看过他的情书，欣赏他发泄兽性、污辱朝鲜姑娘的照片之后，感到自己太丑恶，便刮起自己的毛脸来了。但是，当他正刮得起劲的时候，中国人民志愿军的子弹，结束了他这种战地“美国生活方式”，执行了人民正义的裁判。
