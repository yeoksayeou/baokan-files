    Hebei Yuanshi Cooperative

    Rectifies Cooperative Affairs and Expands Membership

    Yuanshi County's rectification of cooperatives focuses on the four village cooperatives of Chichi Village, Songcao Village, Yanbao Village, and Yangjiase Village as demonstration models. Since the beginning of September last year, although many meetings were held, some systems were established, and opinions were solicited from the members, no actual action was taken. Therefore, the members showed indifference to this rectification.

    At the beginning of November, the county cooperative leadership completely changed this style of only talking and not doing, and instead started from the actual interests of the members, which greatly expanded the cooperative's business and was actively supported by the members. For example, the masses of Yanbao Village Cooperative traditionally engaged in weaving pockets as a sideline production in the winter, but sales were not good at the time. The village cooperative took helping members sell pockets as the main task of the rectification, and as a result, helped members sell 14,000 pockets, worth a total of 56 million yuan, solving some of the difficulties in the current life and spring plowing work of the members.

    The county cooperative's vigorous support for the village cooperatives is one of the main reasons for the success of the rectification. In order to meet the demands of the members, the county cooperative specially sent people to the countryside with goods, distributing them to the members in the name of the village cooperatives. In just over ten days, Songcao Village Cooperative and Chichi Village Cooperative quickly grew stronger. In the past, they could only sell hundreds of thousands of yuan worth of goods per market, but in December, sales increased to nearly two million yuan per market. After the business expanded, the county cooperative began to purchase goods from distant places itself in order to reduce the cost of the goods. For example, buying red sorghum from Shanxi and retailing it to the members was lower than the price that the local grain company gave to the cooperative, so that the members could truly benefit. Under these circumstances, at the end of December, transactions with non-members were stopped, and the situation where people would not join the cooperative even after vigorous mobilization was reversed. By mid-January, more than 500 non-members had applied to join the cooperative.

    During the rectification, it was particularly emphasized that cooperative cadres should humbly listen to and respect the opinions of the members. The guiding cadres of Songcao Village Cooperative had a very good attitude towards the members, but the salesman of the coal factory often argued with the members, causing the members to be dissatisfied and say, "The guiding staff comes to build the cooperative, but the salesman destroys our cooperative." After the leading comrades discovered this situation, they immediately conducted a self-criticism and used it to educate other cadres. Also, when members of one village cooperative wanted to buy red sorghum, the county cooperative did not have it at the time, so they wrote a letter to the members, explaining the reason why there was no stock. The members were very satisfied that the higher-level cooperative cared about them so much.

    After the members understood that the cooperative was their own economic organization, they carefully elected the cadres, directors, supervisors, and their representatives whom they considered appropriate to serve the members.

### 河北元氏合作社  整顿社务社员扩大

　　河北元氏合作社
    整顿社务社员扩大
    元氏县整顿合作社是以池村、宋曹、阎堡、杨家塞四个村社做重点示范的。自去年九月开始时，虽然召开了很多会，建立了一些制度，征求了社员们的意见，但却未曾动手做。因此社员对这次整社都表示冷淡。
    十一月初县社领导上彻底转变了这种光说不做的作风，而从社员实际利益出发，使合作社业务大大地开展起来，同时也受到了社员群众的积极拥护。如阎堡村社的群众在冬季是以织口袋当作副业生产的，但当时的销路却很不好，村社就以帮助社员推销口袋为整社的主要任务，结果帮社员推销了一万四千条口袋，共值五千六百万元，解决了社员目前生活和春耕工作中的一些困难。
    县社大力扶植村社，是整社获得成绩的主要原因之一。为了满足社员要求，县社特别派专人带货下乡，以村社名义配售给社员，在十几天里，宋曹村社与池村社很快就壮大起来，像过去每集只能卖十几万块钱的货，但到十二月里每集增加到销货近两百万元。业务扩大后，县社便自己开始到远地采购货物，以减低货物的成本。如到山西购回红粮，零售给社员是低于当地粮食公司批给合作社的价格，使社员真正得到实惠。就在这个情况下，于十二月底停止了对非社员的交易，转变了过去经过大力动员也不入社的情况，到一月中旬，非社员要求入社的达五百余人。
    整社中，特别强调合作干部要虚心听取和遵重社员的意见。宋曹村社的组导干部对社员的态度很好，但煤厂的售货员却时常和社员闹架，使社员不满地说：“组导员来建社，售货员却破坏咱的合作社”。领导同志发现这种情况后，随即进行了检讨，并用以教育其他干部。又一个村社的社员要买红粮，县社一时没货，就写信给社员们，说明没货的原因。社员们对上级社这样关心他们，很满意。
    社员们明白合作社是自己的经济组织后，认真地选举了自己认为恰当的干部、理监事和自己的代表来为社员服务。
