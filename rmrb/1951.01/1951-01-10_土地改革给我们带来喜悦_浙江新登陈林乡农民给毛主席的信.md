　　Land Reform Brings Us Joy
    ——Letter from Farmers of Chenlin Township, Xindeng, Zhejiang to Chairman Mao

Dear Chairman Mao:

Today, we write to you with extreme excitement to tell you some of the things we want to say from our hearts. In that dead old society, we lived a life worse than cattle and horses. The landlords ate us, used us, and also oppressed us, harmed us, conscripted soldiers, and seized laborers. They forced us to endure all kinds of inhumane things, simply treating us as their slaves, never letting us raise our heads.

After liberation, under your leadership, we organized farmers' associations and struggled against local bullies. Today, under your leadership, we have completed land reform in an orderly manner and have been allocated land, cattle, farm tools, houses, and grain. For many years, our ancestors toiled on the land for a lifetime, but in the end, they still ended up empty-handed. Only today has our land returned to our home. Can you imagine how we cannot be grateful for your kindness? You are truly closer to us than our own parents. In the future, we will always follow your path and listen to your words, and will never be "wavering grass" on the wall.

Now the American devils are invading our friendly neighbor Korea, and the People's Volunteer Army of the motherland has gone to join the battle. In addition to paying our respects to the heroic Korean people and the People's Volunteer Army of the motherland, we will resolutely take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. Recently, we also saw in the newspaper that the Korean War, with the righteous assistance of our People's Volunteer Army, is beginning a sweeping counteroffensive, which has further strengthened our confidence in victory and inspired our enthusiasm for action. In the future, now that we have our own land, we guarantee to apply more fertilizer, process more diligently, and seize the opportunity for winter plowing to increase grain production. At the same time, we must strengthen the control over landlords and bad elements. We remember that you told us long ago: Landlords and bad elements will not give up. In the future, we must more conscientiously reorganize the militia, improve the organization, prevent bandits, and defend ourselves, so that everyone can concentrate on production with peace of mind. We have firmly remembered your instructions and will also educate our children to remember these words. We will definitely be able to defend our victory.

We have said these things, and we will tell you good news later. Finally, we wish you good health.

　　土地改革给我们带来喜悦
    ——浙江新登陈林乡农民给毛主席的信亲爱的毛主席：
    今天，我们以极兴奋的心情来给您寄信，告诉您一些我们心里要说的话。早先，在那个已经死去的社会里，我们过着比牛马还不如的生活，地主吃着我们，用着我们，同时也压迫我们，残害我们，抽壮丁，抓伕子，什么惨无人道的事都要我们忍受，简直把我们当成他们的奴隶，永远不让我们抬头。
    解放之后，我们在您的领导下，组织了农会，斗争了恶霸，今天我们又在您的领导下，有秩序地完成了土地改革，分到了田地、耕牛、农具、房屋和粮食。多少年来，我们的祖先都是在土地上辛勤一世，到头来还是一双空手。直到今天，我们的土地才回到了老家。您想：怎能不叫我们感激您的恩情呢？您真的比我们亲生的爹妈还亲。以后，我们要永远走您的路，听您的话，绝对不会做墙头上的“随风草”。
    现在美国鬼子在侵略我们的友邻朝鲜，祖国的人民志愿军已去参加战斗了。我们除向英勇作战的朝鲜人民与祖国的人民志愿军致敬，今后坚决以实际行动来抗美援朝，保家卫国。最近我们又从报上看到，朝鲜战争已在我国人民志愿部队的正义援助下，正在开始排山倒海的反攻，这更坚定了我们的胜利信心，鼓舞了我们行动的热忱。以后，我们都有了自己的土地，我们保证在自己的土地上，多施肥，多加工，抓紧冬耕，增产粮食。同时要加强对地主坏分子的管制。我们记得，您早就告诉我们了：地主坏分子，他们是不会死心的。以后我们一定更认真地整理民兵，健全组织，防匪自卫，使大家安心生产。我们已牢牢地记住了您所嘱咐的话，并且还要教育我们的儿女也记牢这些话。我们一定能保卫住我们的胜利。
    我们的话就说了这些，以后有好消息再告诉您。最后，祝您身体健康。
                    浙江省新登龙羊区陈林乡庆祝土改胜利大会全体农民
                                        十二月三日
