　　The National Federation of Cooperatives Board of Directors
    Revises Methods for Withdrawing Various Funds
    Approves List of Heads of Bureaus and Divisions
    [By Our Newspaper] The Second Executive Board meeting of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, held on January 8th, approved the list of heads of various bureaus and divisions, appointing Meng Yongqian concurrently as Director of the Trade Bureau, Liang Yao concurrently as Director of the Procurement Bureau, Chen Yifan as Director of the Cadre Bureau and concurrently as Director of the Organization and Guidance Bureau, Yang Gangyi as Deputy Director of the Trade Bureau, Wang Yueyi as Deputy Director of the Procurement Bureau, Zhang Lisen as Deputy Director of the Planning Bureau, Huang Zhaoxing as Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, and Gao Fengtong as Director of the General Accounting Office. The meeting also revised and approved the methods for withdrawing various cooperative funds: 1. Education Fund: 1. Five percent of the final account surplus is drawn from the grassroots cooperatives and cooperative federations at all levels, and turned over level by level, to be managed separately by the county cooperatives, provincial cooperatives, great administrative region cooperatives, and the National Cooperative Federation, specifically for the training and education of cadres or members. 2. Cooperatives at all levels must prepare plans in advance and may only withdraw funds after approval by the higher-level cooperative. 2. Construction Fund: 1. Ten percent of the final account surplus is drawn from the grassroots cooperatives and county (city) cooperatives and handed over to the county and city cooperatives for management and deposited in local banks. It is specifically reserved for the construction of warehouses and the purchase of transportation equipment within the county and city. 2. The county (city) cooperative federations must propose a plan by the board of directors, which is approved by the members' representative conference, and approved by the higher-level cooperative to withdraw the fund. 3. Adjustment Fund: 1. Ten percent of the final account surplus is drawn from the cooperative federations at all levels above the county and city level (including county and city cooperatives) and remitted level by level to be managed by the National Cooperative Federation, specifically for the purpose of supplying business funds. 2. When needed by cooperatives at all levels, they will be provided with periodic loans at interest rates 30% lower than short term cooperative loans from banks. 3. When applying, the application must be transferred to the National Cooperative Federation by the higher-level cooperative, and reviewed and decided by the Executive Board. However, when economic accounting units of the National Cooperative Federation apply, the director shall submit it to the Board of Directors for review and decision.
