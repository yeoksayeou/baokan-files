　　Zhangjiakou Inner Mongolia Daily, Lama Zhabu's Letter:
    Strictly Enforce the Provisional Regulations on Trademark Registration
    Currently, there are still domestically produced goods on the market using foreign languages as trademarks, such as cigarettes produced by the Shanghai Guohua Tobacco Company, as well as soap, toothpaste, etc. produced by some factories. Since these goods are not exported, why must they be marked in English? I suggest that local industrial and commercial administrative departments should strictly ban this.

    Editor's Note: The Provisional Regulations on Trademark Registration, approved and implemented by the Government Administration Council in July 1950, stipulate that foreign languages shall not be used as trademarks. However, this does not apply to goods sold abroad or imported from abroad. Foreign language trademarks registered by the former Kuomintang reactionary government's Trademark Bureau may be temporarily approved for exclusive use for two years upon re-application for registration. In accordance with the above provisions, it is hoped that local industrial and commercial bureaus will pay attention to the trademarks of locally produced goods.

　　张垣内蒙古日报拉玛扎布来信：
    严格执行商标注册暂行条例
    目前市场上仍有国产商品用外国文作商标的，如上海国华烟草公司出品的烟卷以及某些厂出产的胰子，牙膏等，这些货既不出口，为什么一定要用英文作标志？我建议各地工商管理部门，应予以严格取缔。                
    编者按：政务院在一九五○年七月批准施行的商标注册暂行条例，规定外国文字不得作为商标。但运销国外或由外国进口的商品不在此限，前国民党反动政府商标局注册的外国文字商标，重新申请注册，得暂准专用两年。根据上述规定，望各地工商局对本地所产货物的商标予以注意。
