　　Why Doesn't the Post Office Deliver Newspapers? Editor:
    In order to promote propaganda for everyone, I specially sold a斗 (dǒu) of corn to subscribe to the People's Daily. But the post office doesn't deliver it, making me pick it up every day. I think Hebei Daily and other newspapers are delivered by rural postmen, so why isn't the People's Daily? This prevents me from reading the newspaper in a timely manner. And sometimes when I go to pick it up myself, I can't get the newspaper. Sometimes it takes ten days to receive one or two days' worth of newspapers (for example, the January newspapers this year took ten days to receive two days' worth of newspapers). I don't know the reason for this, please advise!

    Editor's Note: The post office's delay and backlog of newspapers, which prevents readers from reading the newspaper in a timely manner, violates the principle of "unified postal service and distribution" that stipulates rapid, reasonable, and convenient distribution for readers. The distribution department of this newspaper has recently received many similar letters from readers. We hope the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will investigate and reply.

　　邮局为什么不送报？编辑同志：
    我为了想给大家作宣传，特卖了一斗玉米订了一份人民日报。但邮局不给送，每天让我去取，我想河北日报及其他报纸都有乡邮送报，为什么人民日报没有呢？这就使我不能及时看到报纸。而有时自己去了又取不到报，有时十几天才收到一、二天的报（如今年一月份的报纸等了十几天，才有两天的报纸）。我不知道这是什么原因，请指示是盼！

    编者按：邮局迟误、积压报纸，使读者不能及时看报，这是违反了“邮发合一”所规定的迅速合理及便利读者的发行原则的，本报发行部近来也接到了不少类似的读者来信。希望邮电部邮政总局检查一下并答复。
