　　The state-owned electric power industry nationwide implemented a planned, regular maintenance program in 1950, increasing the output of existing machinery and equipment and fully leveraging their effectiveness. By the end of 1950, many power plants in Beijing, Tianjin, Fengshan, and other locations had achieved 100% output from their machinery and equipment. The utilization rate of state-owned electric power equipment nationwide increased by 20.12% compared to 1949; the annual power generation increased by 13.03% compared to 1949; and electricity sales completed 103.4% of the planned target, exceeding the annual task. This represented a 47.12% increase compared to 1949, fully meeting the industrial and public needs of various regions and enabling the rapid recovery and development of the national economy.

　　Based on regular maintenance, power plants have gradually implemented a responsibility system, fostering a high degree of care and meticulous management of machinery and equipment among workers. In the third and fourth quarters of 1950, the frantic invasion of Korea by U.S. imperialism, directly threatening China's northeastern border, ignited a patriotic production competition among electric power workers nationwide. Aiming to ensure the safe transmission of electricity, this competition resulted in a reduction of over 50% in the number of accidents attributable to negligence in state-owned electric power nationwide compared to 1949, laying a preliminary foundation for further improvement in China's electric power production. Under the leadership of the Electric Power Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, the industrial departments of major administrative regions, and trade unions at all levels, power plants conducted two or three major safety inspections, discovering and eliminating many potential accidents, thereby increasing the safety of power transmission technology.

　　During the production reform of the state-owned electric power industry nationwide, the preliminary establishment of a quota management system has saved the country a large amount of raw materials, equipment, and manpower. The average standard coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced by state-owned electric power nationwide decreased from 1.025 kilograms in 1949 to 0.869 kilograms in 1950, a reduction of 15.22%. Due to the conscientious implementation of the quota management system stipulated by the Ministry of Fuel Industry in various state-owned power plants in the Central-South region, coupled with the continuous efforts of the workers, significant achievements have been made in coal consumption over the past year. The average coal consumption was reduced by approximately 24% compared to the end of 1949. In the past, coal consumption accounted for a significant proportion of the power generation cost in various state-owned power plants in the Central-South region, ranging from a minimum of 30% to a maximum of approximately 70%. This demonstrates the significant impact of reducing coal consumption rates in the Central-South region on power generation costs. Workers at the Tangshan Power Plant in the North China region further created a new national record for coal consumption in the patriotic production competition. The plant's average standard coal consumption in November 1950 was... [The article continues to discuss reducing electricity theft]. The average line loss rate of state-owned electric power nationwide decreased from 27.75% in 1949 to 16.44% in 1950, a reduction of 40.76%. Due to the improvement of management methods and the promotion of thrift by various power plants, the average plant use rate of state-owned electric power nationwide decreased from 8.52% in 1949 to 6.94% in 1950, a reduction of 18.54%. Continuous improvements in the aforementioned three consumption quotas and management systems reduced the cost of electric power production by approximately 15%, thereby promoting a reduction in electricity prices and assisting the production of other industrial and mining enterprises.

　　Over the past year, the state-owned electric power industry nationwide has achieved considerable success in production, conservation, and other aspects, breaking down the conservative thinking of some responsible cadres, technical personnel, and workers in some power plants. This has made everyone realize that establishing a planned, regular maintenance system is the most effective way to eliminate accidents attributable to negligence, maximize equipment effectiveness, and reduce various types of consumption, laying an ideological foundation for accepting advanced Soviet technical experience.

　　国营电力工业完成去年售电任务
    充分供应了各地工业用电及人民需要
    【本报讯】一九五○年全国国营电力工业，实行了有计划的定期检修工作，提高了现有机器设备的出力，充分发挥了设备的效能。截至一九五○年年底为止，已有北京、天津，凤山等地很多电厂的机器设备出力达到了百分之百。全国国营电业设备的利用率已比一九四九年提高了百分之二○·一二；全年发电量比一九四九年增加了百分之一三·○三；售电量完成了预定计划的百分之一○三·四，超过了全年任务，比一九四九年增加了百分之四七·一二，充分供应了各地工业和民生的需要，使国家经济得到迅速的恢复和发展。
    在定期检修的基础上，各电厂已逐步推行了负责制，发挥了职工们对各项机器设备的高度爱护和精心管理的负责精神。在一九五○年第三、四两季中，由于美帝对朝鲜的疯狂侵略，并直接威胁我国东北边境，激起了全国电业工人的爱国主义生产竞赛，以争取安全发送电为竞赛目标，因而使一九五○年全国国营电业的责任事故比一九四九年减少了百分之五十以上，奠定了进一步改善中国电业生产的初步基础。在中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局与各大行政区工业部和各级工会的领导下，各电厂分别进行了两三次安全大检查，发现和消灭了许多潜在事故，增加了发送电技术上的安全性。
    在全国国营电力工业的生产改革过程中，由于初步建立了定额管理制度，已为国家节省了大量的原料、器材和人力，使全国国营电业的平均标准煤耗由一九四九年的每度电用煤一·○二五公斤降低到一九五○年的○·八六九公斤，计降低了百分之一五·二二。中南区各地的国营电厂由于认真实行了燃料工业部所规定的定额管理制度，加之职工们不断努力的结果，一年来在煤耗方面已获得了极显著的成绩，其平均煤耗较一九四九年年底降低了约百分之二十四。过去中南区各个国营电厂的煤耗在发电成本中所占的比重相当大，最低的占百分之三十，最高的竟达百分之七十左右，由此可见，中南区各电厂煤耗率的降低对于发电成本的影响之大。华北区唐山发电厂的职工，更在爱国主义生产竞赛中，再次创造出全国煤耗新纪录，该厂一九五○年十一月份的平均标准煤耗为每度取缔窃电的结果，使全国国营电业的平均线路损失率由一九四九年的百分之二七·七五降低到一九五○年的百分之一六·四四，降低了百分之四○·七六。由于各电厂改进管理方法和励行节约的结果，使全国国营电业的平均厂用电率由一九四九年的百分之八·五二降低到一九五○年的百分之六·九四，减低了百分之一八·五四。由于上述三种消耗定额和管理制度的不断改进，使电业生产成本降低了约百分之十五，因而促成了电价的降低，帮助了其他工矿业的生产。
    一年来，全国国营电业的生产和节约等各方面，都获得了相当大的成就，因而已打破了一部分电厂负责干部、技术人员和工人的保守思想，使大家认识了建立有计划的定期检修制度是消灭责任事故、发挥设备效能和减少各种消耗的最有效办法，打下了接受苏联先进技术经验的思想基础。
