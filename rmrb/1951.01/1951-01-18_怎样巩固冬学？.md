　　How to Consolidate Winter Study?
　　Shi Ying
　　The national winter study movement has been widely launched. The scale, the number of participants, and the high learning enthusiasm of the peasant masses are unprecedented in previous years. How to consolidate winter study has become a very important issue at present.

　　How should winter study be combined with central work?

　　Whether winter study can be closely integrated with central work is a crucial key to determining whether the winter study movement can develop and be consolidated. In new areas, winter study should be combined with struggles such as suppressing bandits, eliminating special agents, opposing local bullies, or reducing rent; in semi-old areas undergoing land reform, it should be combined with the land reform movement; in old areas that have undergone land reform, it should be combined with central work such as winter production, production appraisal, and elections. Some comrades think that doing central work prevents running winter study, and running winter study hinders central work. This thinking is wrong. For example, in the past, some cadres in individual areas believed that they should "wait until the central work is completed before running winter study." As a result, one central work was not finished before another came, and winter study had to be abandoned. Some others ran winter study behind closed doors, disconnected from central work, making it impossible for the masses to study with peace of mind. As a result, winter study was not easily consolidated. Still other comrades had a purely utilitarian view of winter study, running it when central work was busy and abandoning it when central work was finished. This violates the basic policy of winter study determined by the National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education and is bound to detach from the masses.

　　The root cause of the above-mentioned erroneous ideas lies in not understanding the significance and role of winter study, and not understanding the correct relationship between winter study and central work.

　　Through winter study, we can carry out ideological mobilization and policy education for central work, and we can discuss and solve some ideological and policy issues in the work. For example, in areas undergoing land reform, winter study should be closely integrated with land reform to conduct systematic policy and ideological education. Through winter study, conduct propaganda and mobilization for land reform, explaining why land reform is necessary, and organize the masses to discuss, discover problems, and systematically dispel ideological concerns, explaining how to classify class components, policies towards various classes, and why not to touch rich peasants, etc. In this way, according to the development of central work and the ideological situation of the masses, carry out education to improve the ideological awareness of the masses in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that central work and the winter study movement will not be opposed to each other.

　　When conducting literacy education, it should also be linked to central work. For example, when teaching the two characters "文化" (culture), it can be explained why the working people did not have the opportunity to receive education and learn culture in the old society; after liberation, why did the People's Government let us attend winter study and learn culture. In this way, enlightenment of the masses' awareness can be achieved through literacy education.

　　How should winter study teachers conduct teaching?

　　Whether winter study teachers teach well or not has a great impact on whether winter study can be consolidated. Winter study teachers must first have the thought and enthusiasm to serve the masses wholeheartedly, develop initiative and creativity in their work, and have the determination to overcome difficulties, so that they can truly be responsible to the masses and will not adopt a perfunctory attitude.

　　Secondly, they should have sufficient preparation before class, to study how to teach today? What to teach? What purpose to achieve? How to explain the ideological concerns that the masses may have? That is, in terms of literacy education itself, today teach those few new words, how to pronounce them, how to teach the masses to write, how to explain them, and how to connect them with reality, and how to use them, so that the masses who attend winter study can truly understand and accept them, only then can the teaching task be completed.

　　Thirdly, winter study teachers should spend as much time as possible getting close to the masses, familiarizing themselves with the lives of the masses, experiencing the emotions of the peasants, and understanding their ideological situation, so that they can solve problems in a planned manner in teaching. They should be connected with the peasants' personal experiences, practical problems, and daily affairs. For example, in literacy class, when studying the character "会" (hui - meeting), it can be explained that "庙会" (temple fair) and "上集赶会" (going to the market) all use this character "会". This can not only help the peasants remember, but also inspire them to apply this character widely. It can also be explained that "会" is the "会" character in "开会" (kai hui - holding a meeting). Discuss matters together, and three cobblers are better than Zhuge Liang, to conduct democratic education. It can also be explained that "会" is the "会" character in "会门" (secret society), to conduct anti-superstition education.

　　Fourthly, in teaching methods, various teaching methods should be adopted according to different situations, with more enlightenment, more questions and answers, more storytelling, more use of peasant masses' vocabulary, and more use of the method of teaching in the classroom, practicing in the classroom, reviewing in the classroom, teaching, learning, and applying at the same time. Use more pictographic, associative, oral rhymes, and riddles to teach literacy, and at the same time, use real objects or picture literacy. In teaching, be patient, lively, and explain repeatedly, do not be greedy, do not specialize in moving nouns, and grasp the center.

　　Fifthly, create a learning environment widely, enlighten the masses, teach and learn from each other, promote the small teacher system, and create a learning environment by using possible places. For example, hang literacy signs on the road, post literacy charts on the walls, hang card belts on the arms, establish literacy spots, label objects, blackboards, slogans, road signs, and literacy whistles. Promote group learning and mutual assistance, teach and learn from each other, consciously and automatically, those who enter school first teach those who enter school later, those with high levels teach those with low levels, those who have not missed classes teach those who have missed classes, so that learning penetrates into the lives of the peasants!

　　Sixthly, care for the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and improve at any time. We should also actively and systematically solicit the opinions of the masses on winter study, and constantly improve our teaching. In addition, we should also exchange experiences with other winter study teachers and learn from each other.

　　What other issues should be paid attention to?

　　In addition to the above two issues, attention should also be paid to the following issues.

　　First, strengthen organizational leadership, check work frequently with emphasis, conduct in-depth investigation and research, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner. Exchange experiences in a planned manner. For model examples, attention should be paid to commendation and promotion. The leadership must grasp tightly and not relax. Second, pay attention to ideological leadership, organize various forces, adopt various forms, seize all opportunities, and conduct repeated and in-depth mobilization. It is necessary to clearly explain to the masses why they should attend winter study, what are the benefits of attending winter study, and enlighten the masses to voluntarily attend winter study. Past experience has proved that compulsory winter study will not be consolidated. Third, in order to ensure the consolidation of winter study, various necessary systems to ensure everyone's learning should be established through mass democratic discussion. Only the systems established through democratic discussion can make everyone consciously abide by them. However, there should not be too many systems, so as not to become a formality. Fourth, call on cadres, party and league members to actively participate in winter study, play a backbone leading role in winter study, unite activists, and drive the general masses to ensure the successful completion of the winter study plan. Fifth, winter study should be closely integrated with Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities. In previous years, cultural and entertainment activities often affected the consolidation of winter study before and after the Spring Festival. Cultural and entertainment activities should be used as a form of activity for winter study during the Spring Festival, correcting the purely entertainment view. According to the experience of some regions, cultural and entertainment materials suitable for stimulating the enthusiasm of students for learning and cultural and entertainment materials suitable for the content of political classes should be selected for teaching, and cultural and entertainment activities should be linked with regular learning activities.

### 怎样巩固冬学？

　　怎样巩固冬学？
    石瑛
    全国冬学运动已普遍开展，规模之大，人数之多，以及农民群众学习情绪之高，都是往年所没有的。怎样巩固冬学，就成为目前很重要的问题。
    冬学与中心工作应如何结合？
    冬学能否与中心工作密切结合，是决定冬学运动能否发展与巩固的重要关键。在新区，冬学应结合剿匪、肃特、反霸或减租等斗争；在半老区进行土改时，应结合土地改革运动；在经过土地改革的老区，应结合冬季生产、评产、选举等中心工作。有些同志以为做中心工作就不能办冬学，办冬学就要妨碍中心工作。这种思想是不对的。如过去个别地区有些干部认为应该“等做完中心工作，再办冬学”，结果一个中心工作未完，另一个中心工作又来，冬学就只好不办了。有的则关起门来办冬学，与中心工作脱节，使群众不能安心学习，结果冬学就不容易巩固。还有一些同志，对冬学有单纯利用观点，中心工作忙就办冬学，中心工作结束，冬学也随之垮台。这就违反了全国工农教育会议所确定的冬学的基本方针，势必脱离群众。
    上述种种错误思想的根源在于不了解冬学的意义和作用，不了解冬学与中心工作的正确关系。
    通过冬学可以进行中心工作的思想动员与政策教育，可以商讨和解决工作中的一些思想和政策问题。譬如在进行土地改革的地区，冬学应当密切结合土地改革，进行系统的政策思想教育。通过冬学进行土地改革的宣传动员，说明为什么要土地改革，并组织群众进行讨论，发现问题，有计划的解除思想顾虑，讲清楚怎样划分阶级成份，对各阶级的政策，为什么不动富农等。这样根据中心工作的发展及群众的思想情况，有计划有步骤的进行提高群众思想觉悟的教育，这样就不会使中心工作与冬学运动对立起来了。
    在进行识字教育时，也应该联系中心工作。如教“文化”两字，就可以说明，过去在旧社会里劳动人民为什么没有受教育学文化的机会；解放后，人民政府又为什么让我们上冬学，学文化。就这样通过识字教育启发群众的觉悟。
    冬学教员应怎样进行教学？
    冬学教员教得好不好，对于冬学的能否巩固，影响很大。冬学教员首先必须具有全心全意为群众服务的思想和热情，发扬工作中的主动性和创造性，有克服困难的决心，这样才能真正对群众负责，不会采取应付态度。
    其次，上课前应有充分的准备，要研究今天要怎样教？教些什么？要达到什么样的目的？群众可能产生的思想顾虑如何加以解释？即就识字教育本身说，今天教那几个生字，怎样发音，如何教群众写，怎样解释，又如何联系实际，以及怎样用，要使上冬学的群众能真正了解接受，才算完成了教学任务。
    第三，冬学教员应尽可能的多抽时间接近群众，熟悉群众生活，体验农民的情感，了解他们的思想情况，以便在教学中有计划的进行解决。要与农民的亲身经历、切身问题以及日常事务相联系。如逢识字课，学生字“会”字，就可说明“庙会”“上集赶会”，都是这个“会”字。这样不仅可以帮助农民记忆，还可以启发他们将这个字广泛的应用。也可以说明“会”就是“开会”的“会”字。有事大家商量，三个臭皮匠赛过诸葛亮，进行民主教育。又可说明“会”就是“会门”的“会”字，进行反迷信的教育。
    第四，在教学方法上，应根据不同的情况，采取多种多样的教学方法，多启发多问答，多说故事，多用农民群众语汇，多用堂堂教、堂堂练、堂堂复习，边教、边学、边用的方法。多用象形、会意、口谣、字谜等方式来教识字，同时可利用实物或绘图识字。在教学中要耐心，生动活泼，反复讲解，不要贪多，不要专搬名词，要抓住中心。
    第五，要广泛的造成学习环境，启发群众，互教互学，提倡小先生制，利用可能利用的场所造成学习的环境。如在路上挂识字牌，墙上订识字表，手臂上挂卡字带，建立识字点台，实物标字，黑板报，标语，路标，识字哨等。推动小组学习互助，互教互学，自觉自动，先入学的教后入学的，程度高的教程度低的，没缺课的教缺课的，使学习深入到农民生活中去！
    第六，要关心群众，听取群众意见，随时改进。还应当主动的有计划的征求群众对冬学的意见，不断改进自己的教学。此外并应与其他冬学教员交流经验，互相学习。
    还应注意那些问题？
    除上述二个问题外，还应注意以下几个问题。
    第一，加强组织领导，有重点地经常地检查工作，深入地调查研究，发现问题，及时解决。有计划的交流经验。对于模范典型，应注意表扬推广，领导上一定要抓的紧，不可放松。第二，要注意思想领导，组织各种力量，采取各种形式，抓紧一切机会，进行反复深入的动员。要给群众讲清楚为什么要上冬学，上冬学有什么好处，启发群众自愿上冬学。往年经验证明了强迫命令办冬学，是不会巩固的。第三，为了保证冬学巩固，应通过群众民主讨论，建立各种保证大家学习的必要制度。只有通过民主讨论建立起来的制度，才能使大家自觉的遵守。但制度不宜过多，以免流于形式。第四，号召干部与党团员积极参加冬学，在冬学中起骨干带头作用，团结积极分子，带动一般群众，保证冬学计划的胜利完成。第五，应使冬学与春节文化娱乐活动密切结合。往年春节前后，往往因文化娱乐活动而影响冬学的巩固。应把文化娱乐活动作为冬学在春节期间的一个活动方式，纠正单纯的娱乐观点。根据有些地区的经验，应选用适合于启发学员学习积极性的文娱材料，和适合政治课内容的文娱材料进行教学，把文娱活动与经常性学习活动联系起来。
