　　Tireless People

    After achieving brilliant accomplishments in 1950, the Soviet people have advanced by leaps and bounds in 1951.

    In 1950, the Soviet people completed the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, building their country even stronger and more beautiful than before the war. An editorial in the bi-monthly "Bolshevik" stated: The summary of the post-war Five-Year Plan has not yet been made, but it can already be said that the program of the Five-Year Plan has been completed, and from many indicators, it has been exceeded. Just as the Five-Year Plan was being victoriously completed, a series of decisions to carry out great communist construction projects were promulgated. These decisions gave the Soviet people strong encouragement, and they want to build the motherland of tomorrow even more magnificently than today. At the beginning of the new year, the working people have enthusiastically expressed this desire.

    Ponomarev, a worker at the Ural Machine-Building Plant and a Stalin Prize winner, was recently elected as a representative to the Sverdlovsk City Soviet. From the beginning of the post-war Five-Year Plan to December 28, 1950, he completed thirty years of production quotas. Thousands of his partners completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, including 250 who overfulfilled their production tasks by more than ten years. Many workers are already working for 1970 or 1975. These Stakhanovite workers not only caught up with time but left it far behind. Ponomarev said: "For us Stakhanovite workers, the Five-Year Plan is a mountain. After climbing the mountain, we recognize our strength and see that there is nothing that cannot be done. At the summit, we can see the vista of communism unfolding before us. For the victory of communism, I will work better and more."

    Dorofeyev, a coal miner at the Shakhty No. 46 anthracite coal mine in Donbass, completed eleven years of production tasks in the Five-Year Plan, mining two and a half years' worth of coal in 1950 alone. He is now mining coal for 1957. He said: "Life is better today than yesterday, and tomorrow will be better. In 1950, I received a salary of 70,000 rubles and bought a 'Victory' car. Now, I enter the new year with bright ideals and bold hopes. I want to complete three years of tasks in one year. I firmly believe that my ideals, like the ideals of millions of Soviet people, will be realized in life."

    Kochetkov, a worker at the Dzerzhinsky Plant in Dneprodzerzhinsk, and his fellow steelworkers at the No. 2 open-hearth furnace produced approximately 1,700 heats of steel using rapid smelting methods in 1950. He alone produced 200 heats. In the past two months, he overfulfilled his task by producing more than a thousand tons of steel. This veteran worker, who received the honorary title of "Excellent Steelworker of the Soviet Union" last year and was also elected as a representative to the Dneprodzerzhinsk City Soviet, said: "I am already sixty-four years old, but I don't want to retire. I have worked by the open-hearth furnace for almost half a century. I only think about one thing: how to live longer and work better. 1951 will be a new and happy year. The communist construction projects that have begun this year encourage the Soviet people to strive for new labor achievements. I will further increase the speed of steelmaking and contribute my labor to the great communist construction."

    The production team led by Korabelnikova, a famous young female worker at the Paris Commune Shoe Factory in Moscow and the founder of the joint material conservation movement, has completed the 1950 plan ahead of schedule, making 13,000 pairs of shoes with the materials saved. She said: "I, an ordinary female worker, have received high honors and have been elected as a representative to the Moscow City Soviet and a member of the All-Soviet Peace Committee. I will respond to this great trust with even more intensive labor in the new year, because every new labor victory lays a new cornerstone for the beautiful communist construction."

    Sofimova, a female weaver at the Milanzeff Factory in Ivanovo, overfulfilled the production tasks of the Five-Year Plan by producing 300,000 meters of high-quality textiles, enough to make 100,000 sets of clothing. In 1950 alone, she wove an additional 35,000 meters. Sofimova was recently elected as a representative to the Ivanovo City Soviet. She said: "In 1950, I took care of twenty-four spinning machines. From 1951, I will serve twenty-eight spinning machines and weave more cloth."

    The farming team led by Graschenko in the Molotov Collective Farm in Konstantinov Village, Krasnodar Krai, harvested an average of 292.7 poods of winter wheat per hectare (approximately 636 jin per mu) on 48 hectares of land in 1950. From the other 262 hectares of land, they harvested an average of 134 to 225 poods of wheat per hectare (approximately 292 jin to 490 jin per mu). The Molotov Collective Farm has now been reorganized into a large collective farm, with cultivated land doubled to 1,400 hectares. Graschenko said that his farming team decided to strive for a harvest of 150 poods of winter wheat per hectare in 1951, and on another 120 hectares of land, they would strive for 300 poods per hectare (approximately 655 jin per mu). Now, they have successfully completed the preparations for spring plowing.

    In the "May 1st" Collective Farm in Kariagino, Azerbaijan, the farming team led by Gasanova, who has twice been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, harvested 85 centners of cotton per hectare (approximately 1,266 jin per mu). Gasanova said: "Last year, cotton growers in Azerbaijan overfulfilled the task of paying raw materials to the state ahead of schedule. Now, the preparations for spring plowing have been completed, and this year, cotton growers will harvest 100 centners of cotton per hectare (approximately 1,330 jin per mu)."

    Kurdyukova, a milkmaid at the Kostroma "Twelfth October" Collective Farm, is a Hero of Socialist Labor. Last year, she milked 5,500 kilograms of milk from each cow. Due to the collective farm's achievements in animal husbandry, the Soviet government awarded the farm a "Victory" car and awarded her and five other milkmaids and cattle herders the title of Hero of Socialist Labor and the second Order of Lenin. She stated that they would further increase the production rate of the cattle farm in the new year and contribute richer animal husbandry products to the country.

    Soviet writers have announced their creative plans for 1951. Pavlenko said: "My plan is simple! To write a novel about the struggle for peace. This novel will inevitably involve foreigners, and writing about foreigners, foreign cities, and foreign life is the most difficult thing. But no matter what, this novel has already taken shape deep in my consciousness."

    Katayev said: "Many critical articles pointed out the shortcomings of my novel 'For Soviet Power.' In my letter to the editorial department of Pravda, I stated that it is an honor for me to correct these shortcomings. For a year, I have focused on studying the history of the Ukrainian guerrilla movement during the Great Patriotic War and completely rewritten my novel. I will submit it to the writer groups and the editorial committee of the State Children's Book Publishing House for review in January. This year, I want to write a new novel about one of the great construction projects of the Stalin Five-Year Plan."

    Polevoi said: "My new novel 'Gold' has been published. This novel has been written intermittently for five years. This year, I plan to write stories about the fresh things that are constantly emerging in Soviet socialist industry. In the stories, I want to summarize my experiences with those outstanding workers of socialist labor. I chose the Kalinin Textile Factory as the background, where I used to work and near where I spent my childhood."

    Nikolaeva said: "Last year, the main work was writing the novel 'Harvest.' This year, I plan to write a new novel about collective farm construction and our approach to communism. I want to talk about how expanded collective farms are emerging and how the labor of collective farms is being mechanized. I want to describe the rural life that is becoming increasingly connected with the city today."

    Nothing can stop these people who are engaged in tireless work in the Stalin era from advancing toward victory.

　　不懈的人们
    李何
    苏联人民在一九五○年获得了辉煌的成就后，又在一九五一年大踏步前进了。
    一九五○年苏联人民完成了战后斯大林五年计划，把自己的国家建设得比战前更富强更美丽了。《布尔什维克》半月刊的社论说：战后五年计划的总结还没有作出，但现在已经可以说五年计划的纲领已经完成，而且从许多指数看来是超过了。正当五年计划胜利完成的时候，一连串的进行伟大的共产主义建设工程的决定颁布了，这些决定给苏联人民以强烈的鼓舞，他们要把明天的祖国建设得比今天更为壮丽。在新岁岁首，劳动人民已经热烈地表达了这种愿望。
    乌拉尔机器制造厂工人波诺马烈夫，是斯大林奖金获得者，新近被选为斯维德洛夫斯克市苏维埃代表。他从战后五年计划开始到一九五○年十二月二十八日，完成了三十年的生产定额。他的伙伴中有几千人先期完成了五年计划，其中有二百五十人超计划完成了十年以上的生产任务，不少的工人已经在为一九七○年或一九七五年工作了。这些斯达哈诺夫工作者不但赶过了时间，而且把时间远远抛在后面。波诺马烈夫说：“对于我们斯达哈诺夫工作者，五年计划是一座山，登上山之后就认识了自己的力量，就看见了没有什么办不到的事情。在山巅上可以看见我们面前展开着共产主义的远景。为了共产主义的胜利，我要工作得更好、更多。”
    顿尼兹的沙赫特第四十六号无烟煤场采煤工人多罗费耶夫，在五年计划中完成了十一年的生产任务，单在一九五○年就挖了两年半的煤，现在正在开采一九五七年的煤。他说：“今天生活得比昨天好，明天将生活得更好。一九五○年我得到了七万卢布的工资，购买了‘胜利牌’汽车。现在，我怀着光辉的理想和勇敢的希望进入了新的一年。我要在一年之内完成三年的任务。我坚信我的理想像成千成万苏联人民的理想一样，将会在生活中实现。”
    第聂伯罗捷尔仁斯克的捷尔仁斯基工厂工人柯切特科夫，和他的同组二号马丁炉的炼钢手们在一九五○年生产了约一千七百炉以快速炼成的钢，他一个人就生产了二百炉。最近两个月他超出任务多生产了千吨以上的钢。这位曾在去年得到了“苏联优秀炼钢手”的荣誉称号，又被选为第聂伯罗捷尔仁斯克市苏维埃代表的老工人说：“我已经六十四岁了。可是我不愿退休。我在马丁炉旁工作了差不多半个世纪。我只想着一件事情：就是怎样活得更久，工作得更好。一九五一年将是新的快乐的一年，今年开始的共产主义建筑工程鼓舞着苏维埃人去争取新的劳动成绩。我将更加提高炼钢速度，把我的劳动投入伟大的共产主义建设中去。”
    莫斯科巴黎公社制鞋厂著名青年女工、联合节约材料运动的创始人科拉贝尔尼科娃所领导的生产组，已先期完成了一九五○年计划，用节省下来的材料做出了一万三千双鞋。她说：“我，一个普通的女工，得到了很高的荣誉，被选为莫斯科市苏维埃的代表，和全苏拥护和平委员会的委员。我要在新的一年中以更加紧张的劳动来回答这种重大的信任，因为每一个新的劳动胜利，都是给美丽的共产主义建筑奠下了新的基石”。
    伊凡诺伏的米兰则夫工厂女织工索非莫娃，超过五年计划的生产任务多生产了三十万公尺的上等纺织品，够做十万套服装之用。仅在一九五○年一年内她就多织了三万五千公尺。索非莫娃最近被选为伊凡诺伏市苏维埃代表。她说：“一九五○年我照管着二十四架纺车，从一九五一年起我要为二十八架纺车服务，织出更多的布匹来。”
    克拉斯诺达边疆区康斯坦丁诺夫村莫洛托夫集体农场，由格拉盛科率领的农作队，一九五○年在四十八公顷土地上，平均每公顷收获了二九二点七普特的冬麦（约合每市亩收六百三十六市斤），从其他的二百六十二公顷的土地上，平均每公顷收获了一百三十四到二百二十五普特的麦子（约合每市亩收二百九十二市斤至四百九十市斤）。现在莫洛托夫集体农场已改组成为大集体农场，耕地增加一倍而达一千四百公顷。格拉盛科表示：他的农作队决定在一九五一年争取每公顷收冬麦一百五十普特，而在另外的一百二十公顷的土地上，就要争取每公顷收三百普特（约合每市亩收六百五十五市斤）。现在，他们已胜利地完成了春耕的准备工作。
    在阿塞拜疆卡里亚金诺“五一”集体农场，由两度荣膺社会主义劳动英雄称号的加山诺娃率领的农作队，从每公顷土地上收入了八十五生丁纳棉花（约合每市亩收一千二百六十六市斤）。加山诺娃说：“去年阿塞拜疆植棉者超计划完成了向国家缴纳原料的任务。现在，春耕的准备工作已经完成，今年植棉者将要从一公顷的土地上收一百生丁纳（约合每市亩收一千三百三十市斤）棉花。”
    哥斯特罗姆“第十二个十月”集体农场挤乳妇库尔久科娃，是社会主义劳动英雄。去年她从每头奶牛挤乳五千五百公斤。由于集体农场在牲畜业上的成就，苏联政府奖给农场一辆“胜利牌”汽车，奖给她和其他五个挤乳妇和牧牛人以社会主义劳动英雄的称号和第二次列宁勋章。她表示了他们要在新的一年中进一步增加牛场的出产率，给国家贡献更丰富的牲畜业产品。
    苏联作家们已经宣布了他们一九五一年的创作计划。巴甫连科说：“我的计划是朴素的！写一部关于为和平而斗争的小说。这部小说必然要涉及外国人，而写外国人、外国城市和外国生活是最困难的。但是不管怎样，这部小说已经在我的意识的深处形成起来了。”
    卡达耶夫说：“许多批评文章指出我的小说‘拥护苏维埃政权’的缺点，我给真理报编辑部的信中声明：纠正这些缺点对于我是光荣的。一年来我专心研究了伟大卫国战争中乌克兰游击队活动的历史，根本改写了我的小说。我将在一月间把它交给作家团体和国家儿童书籍出版局编辑委员会去审查。今年我想要写一部关于斯大林五年计划的巨大建筑工程之一的新小说”。
    波列伏依说：“我的新小说《金》已经出版了。这本小说曾经断断续续地写了五年。今年我计划写那些时时刻刻都在苏联社会主义工业中产生的新鲜事物的故事。在故事中想概括一下自己跟那些社会主义劳动的出色工人认识的经过。我选择了加里宁纺织厂作为背景，在那儿我做过工，而且在那附近度过了我的童年。”
    尼古莱耶娃说：“去年主要工作是写小说《收获》，今年准备写新的小说，写集体农场建设，写我们走近共产主义。我想谈扩大的集体农场怎样产生，集体农场的劳动怎样机械化。我想描写今天跟城市联系日益密切的农村生活”。
    这些在斯大林时代里进行着不懈的工作的人们，没有什么能够阻止他们向胜利前进。
