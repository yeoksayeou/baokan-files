　　Changsha City, Guang Jun's Letter:
    Xiangxi Bandit Suppression Victory Memorial Tower
    A certain unit of the Xiangxi garrison helped the local people to eliminate bandits, enabling the people to live and work in peace and contentment. In the past year, a total of more than 70,000 bandits have been wiped out, and more than 80,000 long and short guns have been seized. In order to commemorate the great achievements of the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, the people of Xiangxi have decided to build a bandit suppression victory memorial tower in Yuanling. According to the design, the memorial tower is 44 feet high, surrounded by a park, and there are memorial pavilions at the four corners of the park. Construction has now begun.
