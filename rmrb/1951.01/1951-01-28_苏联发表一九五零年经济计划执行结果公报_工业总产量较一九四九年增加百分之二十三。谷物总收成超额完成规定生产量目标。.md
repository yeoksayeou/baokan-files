　　The amount of coal loading work carried out by machinery has increased 2.5 times compared with 1949. However, the coal loading work process has not yet been fully mechanized.
　　In the timber industry, the amount of work carried out by the Ministry of Timber and Paper Industry of the USSR using machinery has increased as follows compared with 1949: lumbering has increased to more than 1.5 times, and timber hauling has increased to 2.3 times. Although the amount of work carried out by machinery has increased, the Ministry of Timber and Paper Industry of the USSR has not completed the plan to mechanize the main process of lumbering.
　　There has been an increase in the mechanization of excavation work and cement paving work in construction, as well as the mechanization of freight transportation work in railway and waterway transportation.
　　In 1950, the application and development of new, highly efficient technical processes continued to be promoted.
　　In the iron and steel metallurgy industry, further work was carried out to improve the production technology of cast iron and cast steel, and the production of special rotary machines necessary for manufacturing new types of machines and tools was also developed. The application of special rotary machines makes it possible to reduce the consumption of hardware in machine manufacturing and construction.
　　Sophisticated equipment and new production technologies manufactured for expanding the refining of non-ferrous metals and rare metals have been adopted in the non-ferrous metals metallurgy industry.
　　More advanced methods of excavating and refining ore and coal, which require the latest machines, have been applied in the mining and coal mining industries.
　　The mining industry has carried out work on remote and automatic control of underground machines. The chemical industry has produced granular mineral fertilizers and greatly expanded the production of highly effective toxic chemicals for exterminating agricultural pests. New synthetic chemicals have begun to be produced.

　　X. Increase in National Income and Personal Income
　　The national income of the Soviet Union in 1950 increased by 21 percent compared with 1949, calculated at comparable prices.
　　Due to the increase in national income, the living standards of workers, farmers, and intellectuals have been significantly improved, and the further expansion of socialist production in urban and rural areas has also been guaranteed.
　　The improvement in the living standards of the Soviet people is manifested in the increase in the nominal wages and actual wages of employees, and in the increase in the income of farmers from collectively operated collective farming, as well as from their family gardens and personal side occupations.
　　The reduction in the prices of all consumer goods implemented from March 1, 1950 increased the actual wages of employees by 15 percent and reduced the expenditure of farmers on purchasing industrial products by 16 percent.
　　In addition, as in 1950 and in previous years, mention should also be made of the various benefits that the people obtain from the subsidies provided by the state. These are: allowances and subsidies received from the employee social insurance fund, pensions received from the social support fund, free or low-cost access to sanatoriums, rest homes, and children's education institutions, allowances issued to mothers with many children and single mothers, free access to medical care, free education and vocational and professional training, scholarships, and many other remuneration and allowances. In 1950, 39 million employees spent at least two weeks of paid leave at state expense, and workers in some industries had even longer holidays. In 1950, the total value of these remuneration and benefits enjoyed by the people from state subsidies reached more than 120 billion rubles.
　　Due to the reduction in the prices of consumer goods, due to the increase in the nominal wages of employees, due to the increase in the cash and in-kind income of farmers, and due to the increase in the remuneration and benefits enjoyed by the people from state subsidies – the income of employees and the income of farmers in 1950 (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 19 percent compared with 1949.

    一九五○年苏联全部工业的总产量较一九四九年增加百分之二十三。
    按照国家供应计划，过去一年的国民经济较一九四九年得到更多的原料、物资、燃料、电力和装备。
    一九五○年在利用工业设备上继续获得进一步的改进。在钢铁冶金部各企业中，每平方公尺马丁炉的钢产量已有增加。
    在石油工业部各企业中，精炼石油所获得的轻油部分所占百分比已经提高。煤业部各企业中，过去一年间已在更大的规模上采用了采煤联合机，它们的生产率已经提高。电站部各企业中，发出每一电力单位所需的平均燃料消费量已经减少。
    化学工业部各企业在利用制造苛性钠和硫酸的设备方面，和苏联建筑材料工业部各企业在利用生产水泥与制砖的设备方面，都已表现了更大的工作效能。
    一九五○年原料、燃料与电力的耗费较低，材料的损失与浪费已经减少，劳动生产率已经提高，流动资金的周转已经增进。一九五○年关于减低工业产品生产成本的计划已经完成。工业生产成本按比较价格计算已大约减少了百分之六。
    根据一九四九年在发展工业和运输业方面，在提高劳动生产率方面以及在减低生产成本方面所获得的成就，一九五○年一月一日政府特减低五金、机器和设备、化学品、建筑材料、木材和纸张的批发价格，并且减低电费和铁道货运费。由于更进一步减低了成本，这就能够为了减低建筑费而从一九五○年七月一日起再度减低材料和设备的批发价格和运费。
  三、新技术在国民经济方面的应用
    在一九五○年内，国民经济各部门按照计划在应用新技术方面进行了大规模的工作，结果在各部门从技术上进一步的重新装备方面，在提高非常费力而艰苦的工作过程的机械化水平方面，以及在加强生产过程方面都已获得了显著的成就。
    为了满足国民经济最主要部门的需要，苏联工业设计而且制造了四百余种新式的具有高度效率的机器与机械。
    为了建筑大水力发电站和大运河并且为了使采煤和采矿业进一步实行机械化，现在已经出产了具有高度效率的单吊斗与复吊斗的挖掘机与铲泥机；关于新型的装煤与装石机器的制造也已经熟练。
    工作母机制造业设计而且制造了一百余种新式的具有高度效率的五金切割机器和电气锤及电动的压榨机。现在已经生产了新式的工具和磨琢机器，这些机器可以确保五金制造工作获得更高的生产率和更好的质量。
    汽车工业已开始大批生产新式而舒适的“齐姆”式六座客车和新式“齐姆——一五五”式的公共汽车。
    同时也生产了大量新式的电气机器，无线电与有线电器材以及真空管。
    新式的农业机器已经制造出来，已有可能使种植和收割谷物及工业作物与蔬菜的工作进一步机械化。这些机器之中包括新式的具有高度效率的谷物收获联合机和甜菜收割联合机。收割向日葵、玉蜀黍、大米和大豆的联合机都已经加以改良。关于制造悬吊式的农业机器与工具的以及制造剥麻打麻机器和改良水利工作所应用的机器，现在已经熟练了。摘棉机器的产量已经增加。工业方面所生产的拖拉机曳引犁已经大加改良。
    石油工业、化学工业、印刷工业、轻工业、食品工业和其他工业，以及建筑与运输方面的新式设备都已制造出来。
    自动操纵、调节生产过程和科学研究工作所用的新式工具和器械也已制造出来。
    一九五○年内曾进行了巨大的工作，使非常费力与艰苦的工作过程机械化。
    采矿工业方面已经完成了切煤与砍煤、运煤与地下运输的机械化。
    用机械进行的装煤工作量与一九四九年相较已增加到二·五倍。然而，装煤的工作过程还没有充分机械化。
    在木材工业方面，苏联木材与造纸工业部用机械进行的工作量与一九四九年相较增加如下：木材砍锯方面增加到一·五倍以上，木材拖曳方面增加到二·三倍。用机械进行的工作量虽已增加，但苏联木材与造纸工业部把砍锯木材主要过程机械化的计划并没有完成。
    建筑方面的挖掘工作与铺水泥工作，以及铁道与水路运输方面的货运工作的机械化已经有了增进。
    一九五○年内曾继续进一步应用与发展新的、具有高度效率的技术过程。
    钢铁冶金业方面进行了进一步改善铸铁和铸钢生产技术的工作，制造新式机器与工具所必需的特种轮转机器的生产也得到了发展。特种轮转机器的应用，使得有可能减少机器制造与建筑方面的五金消耗量。
    为扩大有色金属与稀有金属的提炼而制造的精良设备和新的生产技术，已在有色金属冶金业方面采用。
    采矿与采煤工业方面已经应用了更进步的开掘与炼制矿砂与煤炭的方法，这些方法需用最新式的机器。
    采矿工业方面进行了关于远距离和自动操纵地下机器的工作。化学工业生产了粒状矿物肥料，并且大大地扩充了非常有效的扑灭农业害虫的毒性化学品的生产。新的人造化学品已经开始生产。
    机器制造工业在铸造和生产电气锤与压榨机方面，在五金制造、加热与焊接方面都进一步发展而且应用了新的技术过程。在一九五○年内，用于高速度切割工作的切割车床相当于一九四九年的二倍。
    在一九五○年，机器制造业方面进行了关于进一步运用自动传送带以制造零件和装配机器的工作，和运用各种自动与半自动装置的工作。操纵技术过程的各种工具的应用范围也大大扩充了。
    冶金工业方面更广泛地应用了自动操纵鼓风炉与平炉加热过程的方法。
    各电力站进一步运用了自动操纵热力与水力发电站设备的方法，并运用了凭高汽压运转的设备。
    轻工业方面应用了新式的具有高度效率的机器与自动织机。非常耐久的染料及使消费品质量精良的新的精作方法也已扩大应用。
    一九五○年内，工人、技师与工程师所提出的旨在改良和使生产过程更臻完善的发明与合理化建议，数目已经增多。仅在各工业企业中一九五○年内就提出了六十万件以上的发明与合理化建议。
    一九五○年在发展与应用新技术方面虽有了许多成就，但是使个别煤场、矿场、木材企业实行复杂机械化的任务，在执行上还有落后的现象，使建筑工程机械化的任务以及精通某些新式机器制造的任务在执行上也有迟滞的现象。
  四、农业
    一九五○年在社会主义农业的进步上，在集体农场和国家农场牲畜的发展上，以及在集体农场的组织和经济的巩固上都获得了更多的成就。
    根据苏联部长会议所属谷物收获量中央国家调查委员会的统计数字，在一九五○年谷物、棉花、甜菜等都得到良好的收成，其它工业农作物、蔬菜、和马铃薯等也都得到良好而满意的收成。
    在一九五○年，谷物总收成是七十六亿普特，已经超额完成五年计划中所规定的一九五○年谷物生产量的目标。
    棉花总收成是三百七十五万吨，较五年计划中所规定的一九五○年目标超过六十五万吨。一九五○年甜菜总收获量较一九四九年收获量超过一百二十万吨。一九五○年，播种面积较一九四九年超过六百六十万公顷，其中小麦超过一百七十万公顷，棉花五十多万公顷。种植刍秫的面积已大大增加。
    将在一九五一年收获的冬季作物的播种工作，业已胜利完成。国家冬季作物播种计划已经完成。在一九五○年，准备一九五一年播种春季农作物的秋犁的休耕地，远超过一九四九年的休耕地，并且是在较短的时间内完成的。
    去年农业的物质基础和技术基础，已更形增加和更形巩固了。
    在一九五○年，农业方面获得了十八万多部十五匹马力的拖拉机；四万六千部联合收割机，其中有二万三千部是自动推进的；八万二千辆载重汽车，一百七十多万具牵引农具和其它农业机器。
    一九五○年农业技术设备的增加已大大提高了农业工作机械化的水平。在一九五○年，机器拖拉机站为集体农场所做的工作量，较一九四九年多出百分之十五。拖拉机和联合机队的使用情况已有显著的改善。各集体农场的全部耕作和休耕工作，百分之九十以上是由拖拉机完成的。集体农场种植谷物面积百分之五十是收割机收获的。农业方面的矿物肥料和燃料的供应较一九四九年增加。集体农场和国家农场牲畜的发展获得了巨大的成就。
    据初步统计，一九五○年集体农场公有牲畜的头数增加如下：大角牲畜——百分之十（母牛——百分之二十）；猪——百分之二十八；山羊和绵羊——百分之十三；马——百分之十五。集体农场家禽数增加百分之四十四。
    苏联国家农场部所属国家农场牲畜头数在一九五○年增加如下：大角牲畜——百分之十一（母牛——百分之十二）；猪——百分之十五；山羊和绵羊——百分之十；马——百分之十四。
    一九五○年底，集体农场，国家农场，集体农民和职工等所有的全部牲畜头数如下：大角牛——五千七百二十万头（母牛——二千四百二十万头）；猪——二千四百一十万头；山羊和绵羊——九千九百万只；马——一千三百七十万匹。
    各集体农场，森林农场，造林站，和草原国家农场，以及苏联欧洲部分的森林草原地带，实行一九四八年通过的种植防护林带计划，已经造林一百三十五万公顷，其中七十六万公顷是在一九五○年栽植和播种的。一九五○年种植森林防护带的计划已经超额完成了。
  五、铁道，水路，和汽车运输的发展
    一九五○年铁道运输计划完成了百分之一百零五。
    一九五○年铁道运输每日平均装载量的总计划完成了百分之一百零三。一九五○年全部货运每日平均装载量，较一九四九年增加了百分之十三。
    一九五○年铁道货车运转率较一九四九年提高百分之八，但仍赶不上一九五○年国家计划的需要。
    一九五○年铁道运输每公里吨燃料消费较一九四九年减少百分之五。
    一九五○年河流货运比一九四九年增加百分之十六，然而一九五○年的河流货运计划没有完成。
    一九五○年海道运输的计划完成了百分之一百二十。一九五○年海道运输较一九四九年增加百分之九。
    一九五○年汽车运输的货运量较一九四九年增多百分之十八。

    在一九五○年内，各部和各处的建筑与设计组织在执行工作时都减少了建筑费用，消灭设计与概算方面的多余费用，使用具有高度效率的机器以及反映先进企业所获得之成就的技术标准及生产方法，用节省金钱的方法解决建筑问题，减少了建筑所需要的时间，改善了建造与装备工作的组织，大大提高了各种工作的机械化，并在建造工作中广泛使用了工业的方法。
  七、贸易的扩大
    一九五○年苏联的贸易继续扩大。一九四九年在工业与农业生产方面，在提高劳动生产率方面和减低生产成本方面都已获得了新的成就，这就使政府能够从一九五○年三月一日起减低消费品的零售价格。这是自从配给制取消以来的第三次减低物价。这次减低物价的结果，苏联卢布益臻稳固。它的购买力提高了，销售给人民的货物量显著地增加了。
    一九五○年全国人民在国营商店和合作社商店中购买的货物比一九四九年增加百分之三十（按比较价格计算）。食品的销售量增加百分之二七，制造品——百分之三五。销售量增加最多的各种货品如下：腊肠百分之四九、鱼品百分之二九、黄油百分之四七、食糖百分之二○、糖果百分之二七、麦片和通心面百分之二九、牛乳和乳制品百分之三○、酒百分之一五○以上、纺织品百分之三六、衣类百分之三三、长短袜百分之四○、皮鞋百分之四八、家用肥皂百分之三八、香皂百分之八六、香水百分之三五、家具百分之三八、留声机百分之四五、无线电收音机百分之二六、照相机百分之四○、机器脚踏车百分之四四。在集体农场的市场上，售给人民的农产品的销售量，特别是肉类、鸡鸭和蛋类的销售量，一九五○年比一九四九年大增，集体农场市场价格在一九五○年继续降低。
  八、职工人数的增加和劳动生产率的提高
    一九五○年年底，苏联国民经济中职工人数是三千九百二十万人，比一九四九年年底增加了二百万人。工业和农林业、营造业和运输业方面职工人数增加了一百六十万人，教育、科学——研究机关及医务机关方面增加了三十万人，贸易及房屋与公用事业方面增加十万人。
    和往年一样，一九五○年全国没有失业者。
    去年有四十九万四千个青年从贸易学校、铁道学校、采矿学校及工厂艺徒学校毕业成为熟练工人，并已在工业、营造业和运输业方面就业。
    一九五○年有七百万职工凭借个别的或集体的教育、或进训练班而学会技能或提高他们自己的技能。
    工业工人的劳动生产率，一九五○年比一九四九年提高百分之十二——机器制造业方面提高百分之十九、钢铁业和有色金属冶金业方面提高百分之八、煤业方面提高百分之十、石油工业方面提高百分之九、化学工业方面提高百分之十四。
  九、文化的发展，公共卫生和市政建设的改进
    一九五○年标志出文化的更加发展和劳动人民文化水平的更加提高。
    一九五○年年底，有三千七百万人在小学、七年制学校、工业学校或其他中等教育机关中学习；在这些教育机关中服务的教师人数达一百六十万名——比一九四九年增加八万名。
    一九五○年八百八十所高等教育机关中的学生人数，包括函授班学生，共一百二十四万七千名，比一九四九年增加十一万五千名。高等教育机关和工科大学毕业生以专家资格在国民经济各部门服务的人数，一九五○年比一九四九年增加百分之九。
    一九五○年有二万一千多名科学工作者在高等教育机关的和科学机关的研究所中继续深造，差不多比一九四九年增加二千人。
    一九五○年书籍的发行量比一九四九年增加百分之二十一。
    电影院、影片放映机和便于携带的放映机的总数，一九五○年比一九四九年增加了五千。
    一九五○年医院、产科医院和其他医疗机关网，以及疗养院和休养所网都已扩大。医院和产妇医院比一九四九年增加四万七千个床位。医师人数增加百分之七。
    一九五○年医疗器械、装置和实验室设备的产量已经增加。高度特效药的产量已显著地增加了。
    和往年一样，在一九五○年还完成了许多工作以建设公用事业、改进城市与工人住宅区、敷设自来水管、延长有轨电车道和无轨电车道，以煤气供给各公寓房屋、开辟草地、在市区和广场上铺筑石子路和柏油马路、开辟公园、公共花园和林荫路。
  十、国民总收入和个人收入的增加
    一九五○年苏联的国民收入按比较价格计算比一九四九年增加了百分之二十一。
    由于国民收入增加，工人、农民和知识分子的生活标准获得了显著的改善，城乡社会主义生产的更加扩大，也获得了保证。
    苏联人民生活标准的提高，表现在职工的名义工资和实际工资的增加，表现在农民从共同经营的集体耕作方面，以及从他们的家庭园圃及个人副业方面所得收入的增加。
    一九五○年三月一日起实行的一切消费品价格的减低，使职工的实际工资增加百分之十五，使农民在购买工业制成品方面的支出减少百分之十六。
    此外，在一九五○年和在往年一样，还应该提到人民由国家供给补助费而获得的各种利益。这就是：从职工社会保险基金中领取的津贴和补助，从社会赡养基金中领取的年金，免费或低费进疗养院、休养所和儿童教养机关，发给儿女众多的母亲和单身母亲的津贴，免费获得医疗，免费受教育以及职业和专业的训练，奖学金，以及其他许多报酬和津贴。一九五○年有三千九百万职工由国家供给经费度过至少两个星期工资照付的假期，有若干行业的工人假期更长。一九五○年，人民从国家补助费中享受到的这些报酬和利益总值达一千二百亿卢布以上。
    由于消费品价格的减低，由于职工的名义工资的增加，由于农民现款与实物收入的增加，以及由于人民从国家补助费中所享受到的报酬和利益的增加——一九五○年职工的收入和农民的收入（按比较价格计算）比一九四九年提高了百分之十九。
