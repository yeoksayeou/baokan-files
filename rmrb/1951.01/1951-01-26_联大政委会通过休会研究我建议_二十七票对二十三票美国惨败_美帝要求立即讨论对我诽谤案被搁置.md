Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: TASS, New York, January 24th: On January 22nd, the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee continued to debate the Korean question. The first to speak was Indian representative Rau. He pointed out that, as he had said in the previous meeting, the People's Republic of China's reply to the Political Committee made it possible to discuss and clarify the issue.

Rau then said that the Indian Ambassador to Beijing had conveyed certain questions that had aroused suspicion to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China had replied to these questions. Rau then read out the full text of the reply.

Rau continued: On January 22nd, representatives of twelve Asian countries held a meeting to discuss the situation with reference to the above-mentioned new statement by the Beijing government. After pointing out that some time was still needed for consultation, Rau proposed that, in order to give the representatives an opportunity to express their opinions on the new statement by Beijing, the Political Committee should adjourn for two days.

The next speaker was the representative of Ecuador, who supported Rau's proposal to adjourn in order to have time to study the full text of the statement and consult with his government.

The representative of Venezuela said that he had originally intended to support the US proposal, but since Rau had read out the new telegram from Beijing, he would reserve the right to speak later.

The representative of Greece opposed interrupting the work of the Political Committee.

The representative of Bolivia then spoke, saying that he had intended to vote in favor of the US proposal, but due to the receipt of the new statement, he must reserve the right to speak later.

The representative of Thailand said that he would vote in favor of the US proposal. But he went on to say that he would also "seriously consider" the statement read out by Rau.

The next speaker was Soviet representative Zarapkin, who said that the US proposal to condemn China as an "aggressor" showed that the US was adhering to the policy it had been pursuing since the start of the Korean War. Zarapkin reviewed the course of US aggression in Korea. In conclusion, he said that the US had put forward its new proposal in order to cover up US aggression and prepare for further expansion.

Zarapkin said that the United Nations should not allow itself to be dragged down this slippery slope fraught with grave danger. He continued: Therefore, the Soviet delegation will vote against the US proposal.

Israeli representative Eban said that he supported the proposal for a limited ceasefire.

British representative Jebb also supported Rau's proposal. He said: Undoubtedly, new circumstances have arisen, and it is necessary to consult with our respective governments on this issue.

The representative of Honduras and the representative of the Syngman Rhee clique insisted on passing the US proposal. The representative of Turkey made the same statement.

Next, Egyptian representative Fawzi strongly opposed the demand of Philippine representative Romulo to immediately condemn China. Fawzi urged careful study and expressed the hope that the meeting would accept the proposal to adjourn for forty-eight hours.

The subsequent speaker, Castro, the representative of El Salvador, expressed his opposition to the adjournment and supported the US proposal.

US representative Austin vigorously denigrated the Chinese proposal conveyed by Rau. Austin asserted that the Chinese statement was not addressed to the United Nations, and he insisted that there was "nothing new" in it, and demanded that the US proposal be passed as quickly as possible.

Thereafter, the Political Committee passed Rau's proposal to adjourn until the afternoon of January 24th by a vote of 27 to 23, with 6 abstentions.

Those who voted in favor of this proposal included the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Canada, and the Union of South Africa. Those who opposed it included the United States, Turkey, etc. Those who abstained included Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina.

UN Political Committee 19th Meeting

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: TASS, New York, January 21st: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued on the 19th to discuss the People's Republic of China's reply to the "Supplementary Report of the Korean Ceasefire Three-Man Committee." Representatives of Chile, El Salvador, Brazil, and the Netherlands supported the plan put forward by US representative Austin on January 18, the main content of which was to demand that China be declared an aggressor. Polish representative Katz-Suchy then spoke. He said that the speeches of some representatives clearly showed that they had not carefully read the reply from the People's Government of China, but had prepared their speeches based on newspaper headlines and the speeches of Austin, who was directing them from there.

Katz-Suchy said: Zhou Enlai's statement provides effective peace proposals, and the Polish delegation fully supports this statement. Katz-Suchy emphasized that Acheson rejected the Chinese proposal approximately one hour after its informal release, that is, long before it was officially published.

Katz-Suchy continued that any representative who cares about the future of his country should recognize that the United States has never wanted peace in the Far East, and that the ceasefire proposal is merely a conspiracy to support American aggressive intentions. These aggressive intentions have been exposed in all aspects, such as Truman's recent State of the Union address to Congress, the recent resumption of the shipment of military supplies to the Chiang Kai-shek group, and so on. The United States has had to admit that opposition to US war policy is growing within the United Nations. To avoid isolation, and also due to the growing influence of the American people's opposition to this war policy, the American aggressors have put on the false mask of peacemakers and supported the supplementary report of the three-man committee. The result of the United States' support for this proposal is that "peacephobia" has broken out in the US Senate. But according to Acheson and State Department spokesmen Rusk and Hickson's hurried explanations, the basic position of the United States has not changed in any way.

Katz-Suchy pointed out in concluding his speech that interference in Korea is only one link in the US planned aggression, but the Korean event shows that the people of the world will not submit to aggression.

The next speaker was Egyptian representative Fawzi, who asked the Political Committee to decide on the next step with extreme caution. Fawzi supported the opinion of the Australian representative that the Political Committee should not consider the possibility of negotiation to have completely disappeared. Fawzi praised Katz-Suchy's speech, namely that war can be resolved through negotiation.

The Political Committee then adjourned.

UN Political Committee 20th Meeting

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: TASS, New York, January 21st: Although the United States has been conducting unprecedented pressure activities in recent days, attempting to force other members of the US-British bloc to support the US demand that the United Nations General Assembly condemn the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor," this activity has been completely defeated. The US delegation had to submit its proposal to the UN Political Committee alone.

When the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee convened on the 20th, US representative Austin delivered a speech when he presented the proposal in the name of the US government, repeating the fabricated slanders and accusations previously made against the government of the People's Republic of China. In calling for the United Nations to act immediately, Austin read out the original text of the proposal, which suggested condemning China as an "aggressor," requiring it to "cease hostilities" by interventionist forces, and "withdraw from Korea."

Following Austin's speech, several Latin American countries, as well as Turkey and Greece, who slavishly followed US imperialism, immediately "endorsed" the US proposal.

Czechoslovak representative Nosek emphasized that the "Korean ceasefire" proposal was merely a means of helping the US aggressors in Korea. Nosek raised the question, while listing the facts of the United States repeatedly violating the UN Charter and the Moscow, Cairo, and Potsdam agreements: what guarantees are there that the United States will not violate the "ceasefire" agreement when it is truly concluded? He pointed out that, on the other hand, the People's Republic of China had put forward proposals that had opened up the path to a genuine peaceful settlement. Nosek declared in conclusion that the Czechoslovak delegation reserved the right to speak later on the US proposal.

Indonesian representative Pala stated that the Indonesian government believed that the People's Republic of China government's response to the "Supplementary Report of the Korean Ceasefire Three-Man Committee" was worthy of extremely careful consideration. Pala pointed out in conclusion that he opposed any steps that might hinder reconciliation. As a member of the Asian Twelve, Indonesia supported all efforts to reach a settlement based on the Political Committee's statement and Beijing's counter-proposals.

Iraqi representative Jamali stated that efforts to seek reconciliation must continue to the end.

The last speaker at the Political Committee meeting was Indian representative Rau. He pointed out that the four counter-proposals put forward in the People's Republic of China government's reply provided a great opportunity to resolve the Korean issue through future negotiations. Rau strongly opposed the argument that negotiating with Beijing meant "appeasement." Rau briefly mentioned the US proposal, expressing concern that declaring China an "aggressor" would make the Far East problem unsolvable. At this point, the meeting adjourned.

　　联大政委会通过休会研究我建议
    二十七票对二十三票美国惨败
    美帝要求立即讨论对我诽谤案被搁置
    联大政委会二十二日会议
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：一月二十二日，联合国大会政治委员会继续辩论朝鲜问题。首先发言的是印度代表劳氏。他指出，正如他在前次会议上所说，中华人民共和国对政委会的答复已有讨论与阐明问题之可能。
    劳氏继而说，印度驻北京大使曾将引起怀疑的某些问题转达中华人民共和国中央人民政府。中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部已对这些问题作了答复。劳氏随即宣读了复文全文。
    接着劳氏说：一月二十二日，十二个亚洲国家的代表曾举行会议，参照北京政府的上述新声明讨论形势，劳氏在指出还需要一些时间进行磋商之后提议说：为使各代表们获有机会表示他们对北京新声明的意见，政委会应休会两天。
    下一个发言的是厄瓜多尔代表，他支持劳氏提出的休会提议，以便获有时间研究声明的全文，并与本国政府磋商。
    委内瑞拉代表说：他本来打算支持美国提案，但自从劳氏宣读了北京的新电报以后，他要保留权利在以后发言。
    希腊代表反对中断政委会的工作。
    波利维亚代表接着发言说：他本打算投票赞成美国提案，但由于接到了新声明，他必须保留权利在以后发言。
    泰国代表说：他将投票赞成美国提案。但是他接着又说：他也将“认真考虑”劳氏所宣读的声明。
    接着发言的是苏联代表查拉普金，他说：美国建议谴责中国为“侵略者”的提案表明：美国坚持自发动朝鲜战争以来即一直奉行着的政策。查拉普金回顾了美国侵略朝鲜的经过。他在结语中说，美国提出其新提案是为了要掩盖美国的侵略，并准备进一步的扩大。
    查拉普金说：联合国不应让自己被拖下这一个会充满严重危险的山坡。他继续说：因此，苏联代表团将投票反对美国的提案。
    以色列代表伊班说，他支持有限期停火的建议。
    英国代表杰伯也支持劳氏的建议。他说：无疑已发生了新的情况，而且有必要就这一问题与我们各自的政府进行磋商。
    洪都拉斯代表和李承晚集团的代表坚持要通过美国的提案。土耳其代表也作了同样的发言。
    接着，埃及代表法齐坚决反对菲律宾代表罗慕洛的要求：即立即谴责中国。法齐力促仔细研究，并表示希望会议接受休会四十八小时的提议。
    随后发言的萨尔瓦多的代表卡斯特罗，他表示反对休会，并支持美国的提案。
    美国代表奥斯汀竭力诋毁劳氏所转达的中国建议。奥斯汀断言中国的声明不是向联合国提出的，他硬说里面“没有什么新的东西”，并要求最快地通过美国的提案。
    其后，政委会以二十七票对二十三票，六票弃权通过劳氏的建议即休会到一月二十四日下午再行开会。
    投票赞成这个建议的有苏联、英国、法国、加拿大和南非联邦等。反对的有美国、土耳其等，弃权的有澳大利亚、新西兰和阿根廷等。
  联大政委会十九日会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十九日继续讨论中华人民共和国对《朝鲜停火三人委员会补充报告》所提建议的复文。智利、萨尔瓦多、巴西和荷兰的代表支持美国代表奥斯汀在一月十八日提出的计划，这计划的主要内容是要求宣布中国为侵略者。波兰代表卡茨·苏琪接着发言。他说，某些代表的发言明白地显示了他们并没有仔细地读过中国人民政府的复文，而是根据报纸标题和从中进行指挥的奥斯汀的发言来准备他们的发言的。
    卡茨·苏琪说：周恩来的声明提供了有效的和平建议，波兰代表团完全支持这个声明。卡茨·苏琪强调指出，艾奇逊在中国的建议非正式地发布之后大约一小时，也就是早在其正式发表之前很久，就拒绝了这个建议。
    卡茨·苏琪继续说，任何关心自己国家前途的代表都应该承认，美国从来不愿远东有和平，停火建议只不过是一个阴谋，其目的还是要支持美国的侵略意图。这种侵略意图在各方面都暴露了出来，比如杜鲁门最近致国会的国情咨文，美国最近恢复给蒋介石集团运送军火等等事实，都暴露了这一点。美国不得不承认，联合国内反对美国战争政策的情绪在日渐增长。为了避免陷于孤立，同时也由于美国人民反对这战争政策的情绪日益增长的影响，美国侵略者戴上了和平缔造者的假面具，支持三人委员会的补充报告。美国支持这项建议的结果，就是美国参议院中发生了“恐和平症”。但据艾奇逊和国务院发言人鲁斯克及希克逊二人慌忙解释，美国的基本立场，并没有发生任何变化。
    卡茨·苏琪在结束其发言时指出：干涉朝鲜不过是美国所计划的侵略行动中的一环，但朝鲜事件表明了：世界各国人民是不会向侵略屈服的。
    其次发言的是埃及代表法齐，法齐要求政治委员会极其慎重地来决定次一步骤。法齐支持澳大利亚代表的意见，即：政治委员会不应认为谈判的可能性已完全消失。法齐盛赞卡茨·苏琪的发言，即战争是可以用谈判予以解决的。
    政治委员会随即休会。
  联大政委会二十日会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：虽然近日以来美国进行空前的施行压力的活动，企图迫使美英集团其他成员国支持美国要求联合国大会谴责中华人民共和国为“侵略者”；可是，这种活动已遭到完全的失败。美国代表团乃不得不单独地向联大政委会提出它的提案。
    当联合国大会政委会二十日的会议开始，美国代表奥斯汀在以美国政府的名义提出提案时，曾发表演说，把以前对中华人民共和国政府的捏造谰言和指责重说一遍。奥斯汀在要求联合国立刻行动起来时宣读提案的原文，这个提案建议谴责中国为“侵略者”，要它对干涉者的军队“停止敌对行动”，并“撤离朝鲜”。
    继奥斯汀发言以后，拉丁美洲若干国家，以及奴颜婢膝地追随美国帝国主义的土耳其和希腊，就立即“赞成”美国的提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克着重指出：“朝鲜停火”的提议，只不过是帮助在朝鲜的美国侵略者的手段而已。诺塞克在列举美国一再破坏联合国宪章，以及莫斯科、开罗、波茨坦协定的事实时提出了一个问题：有什么东西能够保证美国在“停火”协定真能缔结的时候不加以破坏呢？他指出：另一方面，中华人民共和国提出了建议，这个建议已打开了真正的和平解决的途径。诺塞克在结语中宣称，捷克斯洛伐克代表团保留以后对美国提案的发言权。
    印尼代表巴拉称：印尼政府认为，中华人民共和国政府的对“朝鲜停火三人委员会的补充报告”的建议的答复，是值得极其慎重地加以审议的。巴拉在结语中指出，他反对任何可能阻碍和解的步骤。作为亚洲十二国集团的一员，印尼支持以政委会的声明与北京的反建议为基础而达成解决的一切努力。
    伊拉克代表贾马利称，寻求和解的努力必须继续到底。
    在政委会会议上最后发言的是印度代表劳氏。他指出，中华人民共和国政府的复电所提出的四项反建议，提供了借今后的谈判而解决朝鲜问题的巨大机会。劳氏强烈反对所谓与北京谈判就是意味着“姑息”的这一论据。劳氏简短地提及美国的提案时，表示忧虑宣布中国为“侵略者”一事会使远东问题无法解决。至此，会议即告休会。
