Response to criticism from People's Daily

    The People's Daily published an article in its "People's Garden" section on August 9th of last year regarding the case of Zhang Wenxiu, the former director of the Changzhi Post Office in Shanxi, who privately set up a criminal court and forced Wang Huichun, a female postal worker at the bureau, to her death. We are now informing you of the outcome of our court's handling of the Zhang Wenxiu case. This case was tried and judged by our court after the Shanxi Provincial People's Procuratorate filed a public prosecution with our court.

    The defendant, Zhang Wenxiu, used feudal superstitious methods, mistakenly believing that postal worker Wang Huichun had stolen public funds. He abused his authority to coerce and induce a confession, leading to Wang Huichun's suicide by drowning in a well. We have sentenced him to three years of imprisonment.

    The course of events was as follows:

    On the evening of April 30th of last year, 980,000 yuan of public funds went missing from the Changzhi Post Office. The defendant in this case, Zhang Wenxiu, as the director of the bureau, did not conduct a thorough investigation. Based only on the fact that Wang Huichun did not count the money when receiving the key and that she appeared happy and carefree after the loss, he suspected her of stealing the funds. He listened to the post office worker Li Cuisuo's reckless statement: "The fortune teller said that the person who stole the money is from within the bureau and is a woman." He also used superstitious methods such as stepping on the door bolt and grabbing paper balls, mistakenly believing that Wang Huichun had stolen the money. He further ordered Li Cuisuo to coerce a confession from Wang Huichun, who said to her, "Whether you say it or not, it's you; if you're afraid of losing face by saying it, you say it and I'll take the blame." Under duress, Wang Huichun admitted to stealing the money. Because he failed to get any results after several attempts, on the evening of May 13th, the defendant organized bureau employees, with the union chairman Yue Meide convening the employees to coerce and induce a confession from Wang Huichun. Helpless, Wang Huichun drowned herself in a well outside the back door of the bureau at around 7:00 AM on May 17th. After the death occurred, the Changzhi Industrial and Mining District Judicial Section examined the body of the deceased, and after investigation by the prosecuting authority and interrogation by our court, the evidence was conclusive.

    Based on the above facts, our court believes that the deceased committed suicide undoubtedly because she was forced to confess to theft, was unable to compensate for the funds, and was even more unable to confront Li Wenquan (the deceased's nephew). The defendant should bear full responsibility for forcing Wang Huichun to her death. Since the suspicion that Wang Huichun stole the money was unfounded after investigation and understanding, the charge that Wang Huichun stole the money should be dismissed. The Changzhi Post Office must provide compensation to the deceased's family. The lost public funds will continue to be investigated and pursued by the local public security and judicial organs and will be handled as a separate case.

    The defendant, Zhang Wenxiu, as the director of the post office, has received many years of revolutionary education. He was negligent and careless in his work. The internal deposits lacked a strict management and inspection system. After the incident occurred, he did not conduct a thorough investigation and research. Instead, he listened to feudal superstitious methods such as fortune-telling, stepping on door bolts, and grabbing paper balls, mistakenly believing that Wang Huichun had stolen the money. He even organized bureau employees to interrogate Wang Huichun with various vile means of coercion and forced confession, causing a death. This abuse of power, infringement of workers' human rights, and persecution of Wang Huichun to suicide, causing undue losses to the people's cause, is unlawful and should be severely punished according to law to maintain discipline. However, considering that the defendant's motive for the crime was originally to find property, which is somewhat understandable, the judgment is made as above.

                                 Zhi Yinglin, Presiding Judge of the Shanxi Provincial People's Court
                                           January 4, 1951

### 山西省人民法院关于张文秀案的判决

　　山西省人民法院关于张文秀案的判决
    去年八月九日人民日报人民园地发表了前山西长治邮局局长张文秀私设刑庭逼死该局女邮务员王惠春事件。今将我院对张文秀案处理结果告诉你们。按该案系山西省人民检察署向我院提起公诉后审理判决的。
    被告张文秀，用封建迷信方法误认邮务员王惠春窃取公款，滥用职权逼供诱供，酿成王惠春投井自杀之罪行，已由我们判处有期徒刑三年。
    这件事情的经过是这样的：
    去年四月三十日晚，长治邮局遗失公款九十八万元，本案被告张文秀身为该局局长，不进行周密调查，仅根据王惠春在接钥匙时不点款，及失款后喜笑自若等现象，就怀疑她偷款，听信邮工李翠锁妄说：“算卦先生说，偷款之人不出本局，并且还是个女性。”又以踏门闩、抓纸蛋等迷信办法，误认款为王惠春所偷。并进一步令邮工李翠锁进行逼供，李则对王惠春说：“你说也是你，你不说也是你；你要怕说了丢人，你说了我担名。”王惠春在被逼无奈下承认款为自己所偷。被告因几次未搞出个结果，于五月十三日晚，组织局内员工，由工会主任岳媚德召集员工对王惠春进行逼供、诱供。王惠春处于无奈，遂于五月十七日早七时许，在该局后门外投井而死。命案发生后，经长治工矿区司法科检验死者尸体，及起诉机关调查，本院审讯，均供证确凿。
    据以上事实分析，本院认为：死者确是在被迫认偷盗后，无法补偿此款，更无法和李文全（死者之侄）对证，逼于无奈自杀无疑，被告应负逼死王惠春之全责。怀疑王惠春窃款一事，既据调查了解没有根据，王惠春窃款罪名应予取消，长治邮局必须对死者进行抚恤，遗失公款由当地公安司法机关继续侦察追究，另案处理。
    被告张文秀身任邮局局长，历受革命教育多年，对工作疏忽麻痹，内部存款既缺乏严格的管理检查制度，事件发生后，又不进行周密调查研究，反而听信算卦、踏门闩、抓纸蛋等封建迷信办法，误信失款为王惠春所偷，竟组织局内员工以威胁逼供的各种恶劣手段审讯王惠春，造成命案。这种滥用职权，侵犯职工人权，逼害王惠春自杀身死，使人民事业遭受不应有的损失，实为不法，自应依法严惩，以肃法纪。惟念被告犯罪动机，原为找寻财物，稍有可原之处，特判决如上。
                                 山西省人民法院兼审判长支应遴
                                           一九五一年一月四日
