Xinhua News Agency, January 21st:

　　In the Huai River basin and parts of northern Jiangsu and Hebei, which suffered floods last year, great achievements have been made in production and disaster relief over the past six months, and the disaster situation has been stabilized.

　　Last summer and autumn, the Huai River flooded, affecting over ten million disaster victims in Anhui and Henan. At that time, the people's governments at all levels in the disaster areas used all their strength to rescue the victims and the flooded fields, leading the victims to drain water and replant, salvaging a portion of the late rice. After the autumn harvest, the people's governments again led the victims to drain water and sow wheat. In northern Anhui alone, the government lent 130 million catties of wheat seeds, plus the wheat seeds raised by the victims themselves through mutual aid, solving the wheat seed shortage at that time, enabling the Su County and Fuyang special districts in the disaster area to reach 70% of the total cultivated land area for wheat planting. In northern Anhui, from July to the end of last year, the government spent a total of 200 million catties of grain on emergency relief, and also distributed 240 million catties of relief coal and 10 million catties of salt. More than 2.1 million sets of winter clothing recently raised from various places have been distributed to various places. The disaster situation in northern Anhui has now stabilized. Disaster victims in the heavily affected areas of Henan have also put on cotton-padded clothes. The policy of organizing disaster victims to engage in sideline production has been better implemented in northern Anhui. According to incomplete statistics, more than 730,000 people are currently living by engaging in dozens of sideline productions such as oil pressing, fishing, and mat weaving. However, in northern Anhui and Henan, the development of sideline production in disaster areas is not yet widespread, and the work of leading disaster victims to produce in Henan is still somewhat spontaneous. Recently, the Henan Provincial Government stipulated that the commissioners and county heads in the disaster areas should go deep into various places to lead the production of disaster victims.

　　Hebei Province has achieved the greatest success in leading disaster victims to engage in sideline production. In October last year, the Hebei Provincial Government proposed that not only should disaster victims be able to get through the winter, but also accumulate three to five dou of grain from winter production. This call has now been generally achieved in most areas. According to statistics from eleven counties in the Tianjin special district, 250,000 people in 1,893 villages are engaged in production such as fishing, mat weaving, and saltpeter boiling, which can sustain the lives of one million people. The sideline income of Dongtanli Village in Wen'an County in one day can sustain the lives of the entire village for four days. Now, Hebei Province is calling on disaster victims to save, and has launched a competition of "comparing production, comparing saving, and comparing accumulation" to the disaster victims.

　　Last summer, the Yi River and Shu River in northern Jiangsu had a lot of accumulated water, flooding a large area of land, affecting more than three million disaster victims. In the second half of last year, the government carried out work-for-relief, using a total of more than 130 million catties of grain, plus the savings and relief from cadres and non-disaster-stricken people, and the government's mobilization of disaster victims to grow non-staple foods last autumn, the disaster situation has now also stabilized.

　　Now that the Lunar New Year and spring are approaching, all localities have confidence in completely overcoming the spring famine. The people's governments in all disaster areas have strengthened the leadership of production and disaster relief work, especially strengthening the leadership of disaster victims to engage in sideline production.

### 生产救灾成绩巨大  灾区情况已稳

　　生产救灾成绩巨大
    灾区情况已稳
    【新华社二十一日讯】去年曾经遭过水灾的淮河流域和苏北、河北部分地区，半年以来，生产救灾工作都有很大的成绩，灾情均已稳定。
    去年夏天和秋天淮河泛滥，皖北和河南被淹的地方，灾民有一千多万。当时灾区的各级人民政府，都曾经用全部力量来抢救灾民和被淹的田禾，领导灾民排水补种，挽救了一部分晚稻。秋收后，人民政府又领导灾民排水种麦。仅皖北区，去年由政府贷放了一亿三千万斤麦种，再加上发动灾民用互助办法自己筹集的麦种，解决了当时的麦种困难，使灾区宿县专区和阜阳专区，种麦面积达到耕地总面积的百分之七十。在皖北，从去年七月到年底，政府用在急赈和救济上的粮食共二万万斤，另外还发放了救济煤二亿四千万斤和食盐一千万斤。最近从各地募来的寒衣二百十万多套已发至各地。皖北地区的灾情现已稳定。河南重灾区的灾民也都穿上了棉衣。组织灾民进行副业生产的方针在皖北贯彻的比较好些，据不完全的统计，有七十三万多人目前是靠榨油、打鱼、编席等好几十种副业生产生活。但是，在皖北和河南，灾区的副业生产开展还不普遍，河南领导灾民生产的工作还有些自流。最近，河南省政府规定灾区的专员和县长要深入各地，领导灾民的生产。
    河北省领导灾民进行副业生产的成绩最大。去年十月河北省政府提出：不只要使灾民度过冬天，而且要使灾民从冬季生产中积蓄三、五斗粮食。这个号召，现在一般地区都已作到。据天津专区十一个县的统计，一千八百九十三村有二十五万人进行打鱼、编席、熬硝等生产，能维持一百万人的生活。文安县东滩里村一天的副业收入，可以维持全村四天的生活。现在，河北省在号召灾民节约，向灾民提出了一个“比生产、比节约、比积蓄”的竞赛运动。
    苏北去年夏季沂河和沭河两岸积水淹地甚多，灾民有三百多万。去年下半年，政府进行以工代赈，共用粮食一亿三千多万斤，加上干部和非灾区人民的节约救济，再加上去年秋天政府发动灾民种副食品，目前灾情亦已稳定。
    现在，旧历年关和春天快到，各地对于完全度过春荒都有信心，各个灾区的人民政府都已加强对生产救灾工作的领导，特别是加强领导灾民进行副业生产。
