Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 9th: Thanks to the vigorous promotion by the People's Bank and the development of trade in minority areas, the Renminbi has begun to circulate in various minority areas of Southwest China. Tibetan and Hui compatriots in Maoxian, Wenchuan, and Lixian counties in western Sichuan have become accustomed to using Renminbi to calculate prices. Major products in the area, such as grain, medicinal materials, and timber, are all traded using Renminbi. According to statistics from the Maoxian People's Bank, since August of last year, the circulation of Renminbi in the county has accounted for about 80% of all market transactions. Yi people in Leibo, Mabian, Pingshan, and Ebian in southern Sichuan, and Miao people in the deep mountains of Gongxian County, are all taking silver ingots to nearby People's Banks to exchange for Renminbi to use. In general market towns in these areas, buying things with Renminbi is 2% to 5% cheaper than bartering. The trust of minorities in Guizhou in the Renminbi is also increasing daily. Miao people in Jiuzhou and Chong'anjiang in Huangping County are voluntarily requesting a ban on the circulation of silver dollars. Renminbi is now commonly circulated in areas over a hundred li from Guiding County to Pingfa Farm. Many Miao compatriots, who had never used paper money before, are now using Renminbi to purchase salt and daily necessities from trading companies in the city. Minorities in Yunnan who live mixed with Han people along the main transportation lines are also using Renminbi. For example, in Mengzi County, where minorities account for about half of the population, the circulation of silver dollars had been banned in all small and medium-sized market towns by September of last year. In various parts of Xikang, thanks to the active development of trade by the province's trading companies, the circulation of Renminbi is gradually expanding. To facilitate identification, Tibetan compatriots in the province have requested the local government to add Tibetan script to the back of the Renminbi.

　　西南各少数民族地区
    人民币流通面渐扩大
    【新华社重庆九日电】由于人民银行的大力推动和少数民族地区贸易工作的展开，人民币已经在西南各少数民族地区开始流通。川西茂县、汶川、理县等地藏族、回族同胞已习惯用人民币计算物价，该地主要物产如粮食、药材、木材交易都通用人民币。据茂县人民银行统计，该县自去年八月份起，人民币流通量已占市场全部交易百分之八十左右。川南雷波、马边、屏山、峨边之彝族、珙县深山里的苗族同胞，都纷纷拿着银块到附近人民银行兑换人民币使用。这些地区的一般集镇以人民币买东西要比物物交易便宜百分之二到百分之五。贵州少数民族对人民币的信任也日见提高。黄平县旧州、重安江等地苗族自动要求禁止银元流通。贵定县到平伐场一百余里地区，已普遍流通人民币。不少苗胞过去从来没有使用过纸币，今天他们都用人民币到城里贸易公司购买食盐和日用品。云南沿主要交通线与汉族混居的少数民族也已经使用人民币。如少数民族约占半数之蒙自县，至去年九月止各中小集镇都已禁止银元流通。西康各地由于该省贸易公司积极展开贸易，人民币流通面也逐渐扩大。该省藏胞为便于识别，并请求当地政府将人民币背面加印藏文。
