Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a meeting in Beijing from the 16th to the 22nd to study the issue of handling higher education institutions receiving foreign subsidies.

This meeting was convened based on the "Policy Decision on Handling Cultural and Educational, Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving U.S. Subsidies" issued by the Government Administration Council on December 29th of last year. Attending the meeting were the heads of the Education Departments or Cultural and Education Departments of the major administrative regions of East China, Central South, and Southwest, as well as chairmen, presidents, and teacher and student representatives from nineteen higher education institutions across the country receiving foreign subsidies, totaling eighty-five people (representatives from Chongqing Qiujing Commercial College were unable to arrive in time). The meeting was presided over by Minister of Education Ma Xulun, and Vice Ministers Qian Junrui, Wei Que, and Zeng Zhaolun.

Minister Ma Xulun pointed out in his opening speech that in order to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the influence of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression on China, the meeting would focus on resolving the issue of higher education institutions receiving U.S. subsidies. For higher education institutions receiving other foreign subsidies, in general, with the exception of those who resolutely oppose the People's Republic of China politically, the current approach is to require registration, urge them to reform, and make them suitable for the interests of the Chinese people. Minister Ma also announced the main points of the Ministry of Education's handling of higher education institutions receiving U.S. subsidies: In the handling process, the current status of the schools should generally be maintained, without relocating schools, merging schools, or adjusting departments; all original American board members in the schools should be dismissed, and American personnel should not hold administrative positions; American teachers, except those with proven reactionary backgrounds who should be dismissed, the rest can be retained; if there are those who do not wish to remain, they can be allowed to leave; Chinese faculty and staff, regardless of religious beliefs, will generally retain their original positions; schools taken over by the government will maintain their original funding. Vice Ministers Qian Junrui and Zeng Zhaolun made supplementary reports. Vice Minister Qian used concrete facts to illustrate the crimes of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression, and pointed out that the great Chinese people are fully capable of running their own education with their own strength. Vice Minister Zeng focused on criticizing incorrect ideas such as being pro-American, admiring America, and fearing America. The representatives unanimously believed that the government had taken care of all parties very well, dispelling many unnecessary concerns.

Based on the decision of the Government Administration Council and the instructions of the Ministry of Education, after regional discussions, group discussions, individual talks, and repeated consultations, the meeting formulated a handling plan for each school, and submitted it to the Ministry of Education for submission to the Government Administration Council for approval. The handling plans are roughly divided into three types: (1) Immediately taken over and changed to public ownership. (2) Temporarily maintained as private, preparing conditions for changing to public ownership. (3) Continued to be run by private individuals, reorganizing the board of directors and the school's administrative leadership to make it a completely Chinese-run private school.

At the meeting, the representatives of various schools, in a spirit of high patriotism, based on their personal experiences, indignantly exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression, resolutely expressed their support for the decisions of the People's Government, and expressed their determination to run the schools even better.

The meeting closed on the 22nd. At the meeting on the 22nd, Lu Dingyi, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, attended and spoke. He explained that the complete success of this meeting proves that the decision of the Government Administration Council is not only legitimate and in line with the requirements of the people of the whole country, but also can be smoothly implemented. Secondly, he emphasized that the important experience this meeting gives us is that we must regard the task of handling U.S.-subsidized cultural, educational, relief organizations and religious groups as a political struggle against U.S. imperialism. In this struggle, our enemy is U.S. imperialism. In order to oppose this enemy, the government adopts a firm policy of unity towards the Chinese staff working in U.S.-subsidized institutions and organizations, especially the religious believers among them, to help them break away from the influence of U.S. imperialism; at the same time, all patriotic religious believers and other personnel working in U.S.-subsidized institutions and organizations should also unite with the government to oppose imperialism.

Minister of Education Ma Xulun delivered the closing speech, and Vice Ministers Qian Junrui, Wei Que, and Zeng Zhaolun also spoke successively. Minister Ma first pointed out the achievements of the meeting in his closing speech, and then emphasized: "American imperialists will never be reconciled to their failure in cultural aggression, and will do everything possible to play tricks of threats, inducements, and sowing discord, in an attempt to make a comeback. This requires us to be vigilant, firm in our confidence, and stand on the position of the Chinese people, without wavering in the slightest, to smash all their conspiracies and tricks." Finally, he called on the representatives to go back and correctly convey the spirit of the conference to all teachers, students, and staff, resolutely implement the decisions of the government, and strive to fully realize these decisions.

Vice Minister Qian Junrui pointed out in his speech: In order to successfully complete the handling work, we must resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and forever sever ties with U.S. imperialism, and eliminate all reactionary influences of U.S. imperialism from the economic to the ideological; we must support the movement of all teachers, students, and staff in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and denouncing the crimes of U.S. aggression; we must unite more closely all patriots, regardless of teachers, students, and staff, regardless of believers and non-believers; we should strictly distinguish between American imperialist elements and the American people; and we must constantly carry out anti-imperialist patriotic education in schools.

The representatives also spoke successively. Hu Wenyao, President of Aurora University, said: Under imperialist rule, I was a president in name only, with the power in the hands of foreigners; today, I, this president in name only, have also turned over. I will do my best to serve the people. Li Fangxun, Acting President of Nanjing University, said: We feel that we used to live in a cultural concession, and all the administrative and economic power of the school was in the hands of foreigners. This decision of the Government Administration Council has liberated us ideologically from being enslaved, as if we have returned to the embrace of our mother. Li Zongen, President of Peking Union Medical College, also similarly expressed: We must run our own people's education well and serve the motherland. Rong Xing, a student from Shanghai University, and Ma Yuhang, a student from Mingxian College, accused the American imperialist elements of colluding with the Kuomintang to oppress students and obstruct and sabotage students' patriotic actions, while also expressing their infinite love for the motherland.

The meeting ended with warm applause after passing the "Declaration of the Representatives Attending the Meeting on Handling Higher Education Institutions Receiving Foreign Subsidies Endorsing the Decision."

The higher education institutions receiving foreign subsidies attending this meeting included nineteen units, namely: Zhejiang University, Boone Library School, Soochow University, Nanjing University, Ginling College, Peking Union Medical College, University of Nanking, Tientsin University, Huachung University, West China Union University, Hwa Nan College, St. John's University, Shanghai University, Cheeloo University, Oberlin-in-China Memorial Academy, Aurora University, Aurora Women's College of Arts and Science, Yenching University, and Lingnan University.

　　教育部召开处理外国津贴的高等学校会议
    研究实施政务院决定
    拟定方案各校分三种类型处理
    【新华社二十四日讯】中央人民政府教育部为研究处理接受外国津贴的高等学校问题，于十六日至二十二日在北京举行会议。
    这次会议是根据政务院去年十二月二十九日发布的“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针决定”而召开的。出席会议的有华东、中南、西南各大行政区教育部或文教部负责人和全国接受外国津贴的十九所高等学校的董事长、校长及教师、学生代表共八十五人（重庆求精商学院代表未赶到）。会议是在教育部部长马叙伦，副部长钱俊瑞、韦悫、曾昭抡的主持下进行的。
    马叙伦部长在开幕词中指出：为了坚决彻底地肃清美帝国主义对中国文化侵略的影响，会议将集中力量解决接受美国津贴的高等学校问题。对于接受其他外国津贴的高等学校，除政治上坚决反对中华人民共和国者外，目前一般的只采取履行登记，督促他们改造，使其适合于中国人民利益的方针。马部长并宣布教育部对接受美国津贴的高等学校处理办法的要点：在处理过程中，一般地应维持学校的现状，不迁校，不合并，不调整院系；学校中原有美籍董事，应一律解职，美籍人员不得担任行政职务；美籍教师除反动有据者应予辞退外，其余均可留任；如果有不愿留任的，可允其离开；中国教职员工，不分宗教信仰，一般原职留用；政府接办的学校，经费照旧。钱俊瑞、曾昭抡副部长作了补充报告。钱副部长以具体事实说明美帝国主义文化侵略的罪行后，指出伟大的中国人民完全能以自己的力量办好自己的教育事业。曾副部长则着重批判了亲美、崇美、恐美等不正确的思想。代表们一致认为政府对各方照顾得很周到，打消了许多不必要的顾虑。
    会议根据政务院的决定和教育部的指示，经过分地区讨论，小组讨论，个别谈话，反复磋商，拟定了每个学校的处理方案，提交教育部呈请政务院批准。处理方案大致分为三种类型：（一）立即接收改为公立。（二）暂时维持私立，准备条件改为公立。（三）继续由私人办理，改组董事会及学校行政领导，使成为完全由中国人自办的私立学校。
    会议上各校代表在高度爱国主义的精神下，根据亲身体验，愤慨地揭露了美帝国主义文化侵略的罪行，坚决表示拥护人民政府的决定，并要把学校办得更好。
    会议于二十二日闭幕。在二十二日的会议上，政务院文化教育委员会陆定一副主任出席讲话。他说明这次会议的完满成功，证明政务院的决定，不但是正当的，合乎全国人民的要求的，而且是完全可以顺利实现的。其次，他着重指出这次会议给我们的重要经验就是：必须把处理美国津贴的文化教育救济机关和宗教团体的任务，看作是一个反对美帝国主义的政治斗争。在这个斗争中，我们的敌人是美帝国主义。为了反对这个敌人，政府对于在接受美国津贴的机关团体中的中国工作人员，特别对其中的宗教教徒，采取坚决的团结政策，帮助他们脱离美帝国主义的影响；同时在接受美国津贴的机关团体中工作的一切爱国教徒和其他人员，也应当与政府团结一致，反对帝国主义。
    教育部部长马叙伦致闭幕词，副部长钱俊瑞、韦悫、曾昭抡亦先后讲话。马部长闭幕词中首先指出会议的成就，继着重指出：“美国帝国主义者决不甘心于他在文化侵略上的失败，还会千方百计地玩弄威胁利诱、挑拨离间的阴谋伎俩，企图死灰复燃。这就需要我们提高警惕，坚定信心，站在中国人民的立场，丝毫不动摇地来粉碎它的一切阴谋诡计。”最后他号召代表们回去，向全体师生员工正确的传达大会的精神，坚决执行政府的决定，为圆满实现这些决定而努力。
    钱俊瑞副部长讲话指出：为了胜利地完成处理工作，必须坚决地、彻底地、全部地、永远地割断和美帝国主义的联系，从经济上到思想上肃清美帝国主义的全部反动影响；必须支持全校师生员工的抗美援朝和控诉美国侵略罪行运动；必须不分师生员工，不分教徒与非教徒，一切爱国者更紧密地团结起来；应当严格地区分美国帝国主义分子与美国人民；还必须在学校中经常进行反对帝国主义的爱国主义教育。
    到会代表也先后讲话。震旦大学校长胡文耀说：在帝国主义统治下，我是一个有名无实的校长，大权操在外国人手里；今天我这有名无实的校长也翻身了。我要尽我的力量为人民服务。金陵大学代理校长李方训说：我们感到过去如同住在文化租界上一样，学校的一切行政、经济权都操在外国人手里。这次政务院的决定，使我们思想上从被奴役到解放，如同回到了母亲的怀抱。协和医学院院长李宗恩也同样表示：要办好人民自己的教育事业，为祖国服务。沪江大学学生戎行和铭贤学院学生马禹行控诉了美帝国主义分子与国民党勾结压迫同学、阻挠和破坏学生爱国行动的罪行，同时也倾吐了他们对祖国的无限热爱。
    会议以热烈掌声通过到会代表“拥护处理外国津贴的高等学校会议的决定宣言”后结束。
    出席这次会议的接受外国津贴的高等学校计有十九个单位，即：之江大学、文华图书馆学专科学校、东吴大学、金陵大学、金陵女子文理学院、协和医学院、协和大学、津沽大学、华中大学、华西协合大学、华南女子文理学院、圣约翰大学、沪江大学、齐鲁大学、铭贤学院、震旦大学、震旦女子文理学院、燕京大学、岭南大学。
