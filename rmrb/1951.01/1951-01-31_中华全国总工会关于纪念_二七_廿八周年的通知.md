The All-China Federation of Trade Unions
Notice Regarding the Commemoration of the 28th Anniversary of the "February 7th" Incident

　　(1) The 28th anniversary of the "February 7th" Incident is fast approaching. Twenty-eight years ago, the workers of the Beijing-Hankou Railway held a heroic strike to fight for the freedom to organize trade unions and to oppose the oppression of imperialism and feudal warlords. In this strike, the Chinese working class demonstrated an indomitable revolutionary spirit, a high degree of political consciousness, organization, and discipline. This strike marked the entry of the Chinese working class onto the Chinese political stage as the leader of the Chinese people's revolution. Since then, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it has united the people of the whole country to carry out a revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and finally won victory, establishing a people's democratic government led by the working class. As the Chinese working class commemorates this glorious day this year, all the Chinese people are facing the aggression of US imperialism, and a vigorous upsurge of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country has been set off. Our People's Volunteers have assisted the Korean People's Army in dealing a severe blow to the American aggressors, and we should celebrate this victory of great historical significance. However, US imperialism has not yet accepted the lesson of defeat. It is persisting in its war of aggression against Korea, attempting to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and fostering the revival of the reactionary forces of Japanese militarism, the mortal enemy of the Chinese nation, rearming Japan, and turning Japan into a colony and military base to serve as an accomplice in American aggression. At the same time, it is supporting and using the remaining counter-revolutionary forces in China to carry out various sabotage and disruptive activities. The arrogant and reactionary behavior of US imperialism seriously threatens our country's security and peace in the Far East. Therefore, when commemorating "February 7th" this year, our working class throughout the country should further promote the glorious tradition of heroic struggle demonstrated by the Chinese working class in the "February 7th" strike, continue to deeply develop the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and oppose the rearmament of Japan, popularize current affairs study, formulate patriotic pledges, launch patriotic production competitions, and assist the government in preventing spies, fire, and theft, eliminating reactionary rumors, and suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. Trade union organizations at all levels should pay special attention to the Ma Hengchang Group competition movement that has already been launched in various enterprises; conscientiously organize and lead it, so that it can develop into a nationwide patriotic competition movement, and be maintained for a long time as a regular competition movement, while avoiding short-term shock phenomena that excessively increase labor intensity. In this way, we can greatly improve our labor productivity to build our strong economic strength and strong national defense to defend our sacred motherland. By establishing and consolidating advanced production groups like the Ma Hengchang Group, we can consolidate the basic-level organizations of trade unions.

　　(2) Specific measures for commemorating "February 7th" this year:

　　A. Before the "February 7th" commemoration, trade union organizations at all levels should organize workers, especially railway workers, to study the history of the "February 7th" struggle (based on the "February 7th" historical materials published by Xinhua News Agency last year); and use their spare time to organize various forms of meetings (such as worker forums, worker mass lectures) to enable the workers to understand the great significance of the "February 7th" struggle, and combine it with current affairs propaganda to raise the political awareness of the workers.

　　B. This year, "February 7th" happens to be the second day of the Spring Festival holiday. In addition to holding commemoration meetings by factories and mines, local municipal federations of trade unions can organize a commemoration meeting with the participation of representatives of industrial workers and various workers in the city. This commemoration meeting should invite the person in charge of the local committee of the Chinese Communist Party or the person in charge of the municipal federation of trade unions to give a popular and concise historical report on the "February 7th" struggle, explaining the tasks of the Chinese working class in commemorating "February 7th" this year. Worker representatives should also speak freely at the meeting. If there are veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" struggle, they should also be invited to speak at the commemoration meeting. After these commemoration meetings, marches and demonstrations against US aggression and aid to Korea and opposition to the rearmament of Japan can be organized. In addition, it can also be launched during the Spring Festival to extend greetings to the Chinese People's Volunteers, the People's Liberation Army, and the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers.

　　C. In addition to sending representatives to participate in the commemoration meeting convened by the local municipal federation of trade unions, the railway trade union may also hold separate mass commemoration meetings of railway workers (especially in Changxindian, Zhengzhou, and Jiang'an) and marches. The specific measures will be notified separately by the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union.

　　中华全国总工会
    关于纪念“二七”廿八周年的通知
    （一）“二七”二十八周年纪念日就快要到来了。二十八年以前，京汉铁路工人为争取组织工会的自由权利，举行了英勇的大罢工，反对帝国主义和封建军阀的压迫。在这次罢工斗争中，中国工人阶级表现出了坚强不屈的革命精神、高度的政治觉悟与高度的组织性和纪律性。这次大罢工标志着中国工人阶级以中国人民革命的领导者的姿态走上了中国的政治舞台。从此，它在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，团结全国人民，进行反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义统治的革命斗争，终于获得了胜利，建立了由工人阶级领导的人民民主政权。今年中国工人阶级纪念这个光荣的日子的时候，正当全中国人民面临美帝国主义的侵略，掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国的怒潮，我人民志愿军协助朝鲜人民军，给美国侵略者以严重地打击，我们应该庆祝这一具有巨大历史意义的胜利。但美帝国主义尚未接受失败的教训，它正坚持对朝鲜的侵略战争，妄图占领我国领土台湾，并扶植中华民族死敌日本军阀的反动势力复活，重新武装日本，把日本变成殖民地和军事基地，作为美国的侵略帮凶。同时，它又支持和利用中国的反革命残余势力，进行各种捣乱和破坏活动。美帝国主义横暴而反动的行为，严重地威胁着我国的安全与远东的和平。因此，今年纪念“二七”的时候，我们全国工人阶级就应更加发扬中国工人阶级在“二七”大罢工中所表现出来的英勇斗争的光荣传统，继续深入地开展抗美援朝反对武装日本运动，普及时事学习，订立爱国公约，开展爱国主义的生产竞赛，并协助政府防奸、防火、防盗，消灭反动谣言，镇压反革命活动。各地工会组织应特别注意目前已在各企业部门所展开的马恒昌小组竞赛运动；切实加以组织和领导，使之开展成为普遍全国的爱国竞赛运动，并长久坚持下去，成为经常的竞赛运动，而避免过分加强劳动强度的短时突击现象。这样来把我们的劳动生产率大大地提高一步，来建设我们强大的经济力量与强大的国防力量，保卫我们神圣的祖国；并通过建立和巩固这样马恒昌式的先进生产小组的方法，来巩固工会的基层组织。
    （二）今年纪念“二七”的具体办法：
    甲、在“二七”纪念以前，各地工会组织，应在工人群众中，特别是在铁路工人中，组织工人学习“二七”斗争史（可以根据去年新华社发表的“二七”史料）；并利用工余时间，组织各种形式的会议（如工人座谈会、工人群众讲演会），使工人群众了解“二七”斗争的重大意义，并结合目前时事宣传，以提高工人群众的政治觉悟。
    乙、今年“二七”恰是春节休假第二天，各地工会组织除了以厂矿为单位召开纪念会外，各地市总工会可组织一个以产业工人代表为主并有全市各种工人代表参加的纪念会。这个纪念会应邀请中国共产党当地党委负责人或市总工会负责人作通俗简明的“二七”斗争的历史报告，说明今年中国工人阶级在纪念“二七”时的任务。会上并应有工人代表自由发言，如当地有曾经参加过“二七”斗争的老工人，也应邀请他们在纪念会上讲话。在这些纪念会后，可组织抗美援朝反对武装日本的游行示威。此外，还可发动在春节中慰问中国人民志愿军、人民解放军，以及烈士家属、革命军人家属。
    丙、铁路工会，除应选派代表参加当地市总工会召集的纪念会外；并可单独举行铁路工人群众纪念大会（特别是长辛店、郑州、江岸）和游行示威。其具体办法由铁路工会全国委员会另行通知。
