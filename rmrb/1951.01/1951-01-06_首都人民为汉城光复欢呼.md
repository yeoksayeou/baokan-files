Following the liberation of Pyongyang, the news of the recovery of Seoul, the capital of Korea, has brought tremendous encouragement to the people of Beijing. Yesterday (the 5th), starting with a midnight parade by Peking University, the snow-covered streets of Beijing were filled with continuous processions of students and women. Upon hearing the news of the recapture of Seoul, the teachers and students of Renmin University of China celebrated with gongs and drums. The Central Academy of Fine Arts had long prepared portraits of Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung, as well as propaganda posters, and immediately organized a parade upon hearing the news of the recapture of Seoul. Many students from Northern Jiaotong University and Beijing Railway College wrote letters to the Chinese and Korean People's Forces to congratulate and pay tribute. At noon, they passed a letter of congratulations from all the students to the heroic Chinese and Korean People's Forces amidst warm applause. Songs echoed throughout the Medical College of Peking University; in the evening, the outpatient department was decorated with lanterns and streamers, and a celebration party was held. The New Life Women's Middle School held a grand celebration to celebrate the recapture of Seoul. At the meeting, congratulatory letters to Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung were adopted. Teachers and students from Beijing Normal University, Fu Jen Catholic University, the Engineering College of North China University, and other universities and middle schools in Beijing mostly participated in parades or held grand gatherings to celebrate the recapture of Seoul.

Elementary school teachers from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Districts enthusiastically held celebratory parades. The parade team in the Fifth District sang their own composed song "Celebrating the Recapture of Seoul" along the way.

The Beijing Municipal Women's Federation organized about 600 working women from parts of the First, Third, and Fifth Districts, as well as members from the Beijing Women's Federation, the Women's Temperance Society, the Young Women's Christian Association, and the Peking University Family Women's Association in two hours. They held a victory parade at 2:30 PM yesterday. Holding high the national flags of China and Korea, red flags, and large banners with "Celebrating the Recapture of Seoul," they shouted slogans and marched grandly through the streets. A Yangko team of disguised workers, students, peasant women, nurses, and Korean women danced excitedly to the sound of gongs and drums.

The workers of the 70th Ordnance Factory and the Beijing Machine Factory asked each other as soon as they met at work, "Seoul has been recovered, did you know?" Some workers immediately went to the trade union to write several big-character posters, posted them on the site, and called on everyone to "intensify production and eliminate all American aggressors!" Workers at the Beijing Tram Repair Factory celebrated the recapture of Seoul, and each team formulated production competition conditions, creating a surge of challenges. The work teams expressed their intention to implement the three major responsibility systems in the competition: machine responsibility system, tool responsibility system, and cleaning responsibility system. The staff and workers of the Liulihe Cement Plant are working hard to strive for greater achievements in 1951, and the news of the recapture of Seoul has further stimulated their production enthusiasm. The quarry workers in Zhoukoudian shouted while pushing their carts: "Push faster! Our volunteers are winning so quickly, we can't fall behind!" To celebrate the recapture of Seoul, the factory workers will launch a new production challenge. Cadre training course students of the Beijing Municipal Committee and employees of many units of the Beijing Postal Administration held celebration symposiums.

All the staff of the Korean Embassy were immersed in joy on the night of the 4th, and they worked all night for the recovery of their country's capital. The next day, from 7:30 AM to 5:00 PM, the crowd cheering in front of the Korean Embassy never stopped. Thirteen schools presented moving congratulatory messages here, all of them saying: "The victory of the Korean people is our victory, is the victory of the people of the whole world." Choi Young, the Counselor of the Korean Embassy, and Kang Seok-gye, the First Secretary, on behalf of Ambassador Lee Joo-yeon, said to the cheering crowd: "Seoul has been recovered, we thank Chairman Mao, we thank the Chinese People's Volunteers."
