　　Establishment of Study Group for Cadres Working at Headquarters of Democratic Parties

[This newspaper report] The study group for cadres working at the headquarters of various democratic parties, after more than three months of preparation, was formally established at 2:00 PM on January 4th.  The founding meeting was held in the auditorium of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended by more than 200 cadres working at the headquarters of various democratic parties and staff members of the National Committee. Li Jun, the convener of the study task force, served as chairman. He said, "We must strengthen unity and achieve greater progress through study." Guo Zechen, director of the Secretariat of the National Committee, was invited to deliver a speech. He said, "Doing a good job in the study of cadres working for various democratic parties is one of the central tasks of the National Committee in 1951." This gave great encouragement to everyone participating in the study.  Afterwards, the conference invited Chen Kehan, director of the Xinhua News Agency, to give a report on the international situation.

The conference adopted the provisional measures for the study group, stipulating that "in order to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, through a combination of self-study and collective study, we will exchange learning experiences and conduct planned discussions on policies and current events, in order to improve political understanding and working ability." The working body of the study group is the task force.  The task force is composed of representatives from each unit, who mutually elect three conveners. The conveners serve a term of three months and are divided into study, general affairs, and liaison sections. The task force meets every Monday to arrange and plan the study.

The study content for the first phase (three months) is stipulated as: (1) The new situation after the liberation of Pyongyang; (2) Problems of united front work. It is planned to have collective study sessions every two weeks, and group discussions when necessary.  A report meeting will be held at the beginning or end of each problem study.
