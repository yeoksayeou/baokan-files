How did the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee establish a propaganda network?
　　By Xing Lu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee

　　The CPC Anshan Municipal Committee began establishing propagandists in Anshan Iron and Steel in April of last year, and later expanded to urban and rural areas. Currently, there are 1,794 propagandists in the city. The propagandists consist of cadres from Party, government, labor union, and youth league departments, as well as advanced elements among workers, technicians, teachers, and students. Among them are some responsible comrades from mines and factories. For example, among the 98 propagandists in the Ore Dressing Plant, 12 are factory-level cadres such as factory directors and deputy directors.

　　When selecting propagandists here, the general criteria are based on the two main conditions stipulated by the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee: firm political stance, connection with the masses, and a certain degree of propaganda ability. When selecting non-Party propagandists, most Party committees also pay attention to the principle of voluntarism, holding talks with the selected individuals in advance and obtaining their consent.

　　Currently, the methods for developing propagandists vary greatly, generally using these three methods: The first method is relatively strict, requiring discussion and approval by the Party branch, general branch, and Party committee. Propagandists developed using this method generally have a deeper understanding of the work of propagandists and can recognize that they are assistants to the Party in carrying out political work among the masses; therefore, they feel it is an honor to be a Party propagandist. Some propagandists even carefully remember the date on which they were approved by the Party to be propagandists and are determined to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party. The work of these propagandists is also relatively well done. However, not many in the city use this method. The more common method is the second one, namely: the list is first proposed by the propaganda committee member or propaganda officer of the Party committee or general branch and submitted to the secretary of the Party committee or general branch for approval. This approval is extremely simple and hasty; the general branch and the Party committee do not discuss it but simply approve it based on the list. Propagandists developed using this method also understand that this is a task given by the Party, but their understanding of the significance of establishing propagandists is insufficient, so they can only generally carry out some propaganda work. The third method is the worst, which is designated by the labor union's cultural and educational departments, without being submitted to the Party committee or general branch for discussion and research; the Party committee or general branch also adopts an attitude of indifference. Therefore, most of the propagandists established using this method cannot complete the tasks that propagandists should have, but can only do some general cultural and educational work. Based on the experience of this period, the selection of propagandists should be that the branch discusses and proposes a list, and the Party committee or general branch approves it (Editor's note: According to the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network for the masses of people throughout the Party, it should be "reviewed and approved by the Party branch committee and approved by the higher-level Party organization.").

　　Another problem is that in the development of propagandists, some Party committees or general branches do not have sufficient understanding of the significance of establishing propagandists, and turn a blind eye to the erroneous phenomenon of certain Party member cadres being unwilling to be propagandists, forming a bias towards developing worker propagandists as the main force, reducing the Party's leading role in propaganda work. Some Party committees or general branches set the conditions for propagandists too high, forming a bias towards developing propagandists only among cadres; both of these affect the in-depth and widespread nature of propaganda work. Both of these biases should be overcome. The correct approach is that the Party committee, branch secretary, and branch committee members should first take the lead in assuming the work of Party propagandists, and then pay attention to absorbing advanced elements in production labor (including workers and engineers, technicians) as propagandists (Editor's note: According to the Central Committee's decision, every branch secretary, branch committee member of the Party and the Communist Youth League, and Party members and Communist Youth League members who have regular work contacts with the masses should serve as propagandists.) This can better implement the Party's various guidelines for production and construction, and can closely combine workers' labor enthusiasm with science and technology to implement these guidelines.

　　After determining the propagandists, attention should be paid to the training of propagandists, which is one of the keys to determining the success or failure of propaganda work. Anshan City has adopted these methods: First, taking the study of propaganda work as one of the regular courses in Party schools to teach Party members to do a good job of propaganda work correctly and effectively. Secondly, holding amateur propagandist training classes to regularly conduct ideological and political education and improve propaganda skills for propagandists; as well as conveying the resolutions of the higher-level Party's propaganda work, arranging propaganda content, and discussing propaganda methods, etc. However, these tasks are not frequent enough and are intermittent. Improvements should be noted in the future.

　　In addition to Party committees at all levels strengthening their leadership over propagandists and regarding propagandists as their assistants in carrying out political work among the masses, administrative authorities at all levels should also provide propagandists with various material assistance and convenience for activities, and give play to this organizational force to do their work well. Jin Feng (Communist Party member), director of the Ore Dressing Plant, in addition to actively participating in propaganda work himself, paid special attention to cultivating the prestige of propagandists when he began to establish the propaganda organization. Some on-site foremen did not pay much attention to the work of propagandists, and Comrade Jin Feng promptly pointed out: "Propaganda and mobilization work is one of the important methods for doing a good job in production." In summarizing the third quarter production competition, he also pointed out: "One of the reasons for obtaining these achievements is that everyone has done a good job in propaganda work." This is a fact. One-third of the 35 propagandists in the Ore Dressing Plant were rated as advanced producers. Therefore, the propagandists of the Ore Dressing Plant have a very high prestige among the masses, and some people say: "Almost all the essence of the entire plant is concentrated in the propaganda group!" The work of propagandists has indeed improved the relationship between the Party and the workers and strengthened the unity of the employees. For example, because Pang Wei, a technician among the propagandists, patiently taught the workers how to mix ingredients, not only did the production volume exceed the original target by 300 tons; it also solved the problem that technicians in the past did not have time to take care of other work because they had to do the mixing work. The workers happily said, "The prejudices between technicians and workers have disappeared." At the same time, it significantly improved the production enthusiasm of the majority of employees, especially since the patriotic anti-American aid Korea competition, after the propagandists' propaganda, all employees understood that their production task is part of the national anti-American aid Korea movement, so their production efficiency has been continuously increasing and overfulfilling tasks: exceeding 16.4% in October of last year; exceeding 33.8% in November. Now everyone attaches importance to the work of propagandists.

### 中共鞍山市委怎样建立宣传网的？

　　中共鞍山市委怎样建立宣传网的？
    中共鞍山市委宣传部副部长  邢路
    中共鞍山市委，于去年四月就开始在鞍钢建立宣传员，以后发展到市区内外，现全市共有宣传员一千七百九十四名。宣传员的成份，有党、政、工、青各部门干部和工人、技术人员、教员、学生中的先进分子。其中并有一些矿厂负责同志。例如选矿厂的九十八名宣传员中，就有十二人是正副厂长等厂一级干部。
    这里选拔宣传员时，一般的是按照中共中央东北局宣传部所规定的两个主要条件：政治立场坚定、与群众有联系和有一定的宣传能力。大部分党委在选拔非党宣传员时，还注意了自愿的原则，事先与被选拔的人进行谈话，取得对方的同意。
    目前发展宣传员的方法极不一致，大体用这三种方法：第一种比较严格，必须经过党支部、总支、党委的讨论与批准。所有采取此种方法发展的宣传员，一般的对宣传员工作有比较深刻的认识，能够认识到自己是党在群众中进行政治工作的助手；因而感到作一个党的宣传员是光荣的。有些宣传员并认真的记住了自己是某月某日被党批准为宣传员的，一定要很好地完成党所交给的光荣的任务。这些宣传员的工作也就比较作的好。但是全市采用此种方法的还不多。普遍的是采用第二种方法，即：先由党委或总支的宣传委员或宣传干事提出名单，交给党委或总支书记批准。这种批准是极简单草率的，总支和党委不进行讨论只是根据名单批准了。采用此种方法发展的宣传员，他们也还了解到这是党所给予的任务，但是对建立宣传员的意义是认识不足的，因此只能一般地进行一些宣传工作。第三种方法是最坏的，是由工会文教部门指定，既未交给党委及总支讨论研究；党委或总支也采取不闻不问的态度。所以用这种方法建立起来的宣传员，多半不能完成宣传员应有的任务，而是只能作一些一般的文教工作。根据这一时期的经验，选拔宣传员应当是支部讨论提出名单，由党委或总支批准（编者按：按照中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定，应当是“经过党的支部委员会的审查通过和高一级党组织的批准。”）。
    另一个问题是在发展宣传员中，有些党委或总支对建立宣传员的意义认识不足，对某些党员干部不愿当宣传员的错误现象置之不理，形成以发展了工人宣传员为主的偏向，降低了党在宣传工作中的领导作用。另有些党委或总支则对宣传员条件提得太高，形成了只在干部中发展宣传员的偏向；这都影响了宣传工作的深入与普遍。这两种偏向都应该加以克服。正确的是党委、支部书记与支部委员首先以身作则的担负党的宣传员工作，然后注意吸收生产劳动中的先进分子（包括工人和工程师、技术人员）为宣传员（编者按：按照中央的决定，党和青年团的每个支部书记、支部委员和与人民群众有经常工作联系的党员和青年团员都应当担任宣传员。）这样能更好地贯彻党对生产建设的各项方针，而且能够把工人的劳动热情与科学技术密切结合起来，贯彻这些方针。
    确定宣传员后，就应该注意宣传员的培养工作，这是决定宣传工作成败的关键之一。鞍山市曾经采用过这些方法：首先将学习宣传工作作为党校正课之一，教会党员正确地有办法地作好宣传工作。其次举办业余宣传员训练班，以便对宣传员定期地进行思想上政治上的教育与宣传能力上的提高；以及向宣传员传达上级党的宣传工作决议，布置宣传内容，讨论宣传方法等。但这些工作都不够经常，时断时续。今后应该注意改进。
    除了各级党委应该加强对宣传员的领导，把宣传员作为自己在群众中进行政治工作的助手外，各级行政上也应给宣传员以各种物质帮助和活动的方便，并发挥这一组织力量，作好自己工作。选矿厂厂长金锋（共产党员），除了自己积极参加宣传工作外，在开始建立宣传组织时，特别注意培养宣传员的威信。有些现场场长不大重视宣传员工作，金锋同志就及时予以指出：“宣传鼓动工作是作好生产工作的重要方法之一。”在总结第三季度生产竞赛时，他又指出：“获得这些成绩的原因之一，就是大家作好了宣传工作。”这是事实，选矿厂的三十五名宣传员中，就有三分之一被评为先进生产者。因此选矿厂的宣传员在群众中的威信很高，有人说：“几乎把全厂的精华都集中在宣传组里去了！”宣传员的工作确实改善了党与工人的关系，加强了职工的团结，如由于技术员中的宣传员庞维耐心的教会工人配料，不仅使生产量超过原定任务三百吨；而且解决了过去因技术员要作配料工作而没时间照应其他工作的问题。工人们高兴地说：“技术员与工友的成见消失了。”同时很明显的提高了广大职工的生产热情，尤其抗美援朝的爱国主义竞赛以来，经过宣传员的宣传，全体职工了解自己的生产任务是全国抗美援朝运动的一部分，因此他们的生产效率不断的增高，超额的完成任务：去年十月份超过百分之十六·四；十一月份更超过百分之三三·八。现在大家都重视宣传员的工作了。
