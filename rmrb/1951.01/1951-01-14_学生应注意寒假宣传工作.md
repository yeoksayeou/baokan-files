To the Editor:
　　Winter vacation is approaching, and students' intense studies will temporarily come to an end. Many students will return home. During the Spring Festival, there are many gatherings in the vast rural areas, and the farmers are not very busy. We believe that this is a good opportunity to carry out propaganda work. Students in various places should consciously undertake the task of propaganda, cooperate with the local government to do a good job in propaganda, and deeply spread the patriotic ideology of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country to the broad masses of peasants.

　　学生应注意寒假宣传工作编辑同志：
    寒假快到了，同学们紧张的学习将暂时告一段落。不少同学将回家去。春节广大农村中集会较多，农民们也不大忙。我们觉得这是进行宣传工作的好机会，各地同学们应自觉地担负起宣传的任务，配合当地政府做好宣传工作，把抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义思想教育，深入地传播到广大农民群众中去。
