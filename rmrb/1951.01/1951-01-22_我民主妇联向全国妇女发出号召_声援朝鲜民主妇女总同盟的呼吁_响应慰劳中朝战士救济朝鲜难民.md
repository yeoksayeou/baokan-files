[Report from this newspaper] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, in order to support the appeal of the Korean Democratic Women's League to women worldwide and to respond to the "Notice on Comforting Chinese and Korean People's Soldiers and Aiding Korean Refugees" issued by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, hereby issues an appeal to women nationwide, the full text of which is as follows:
　　Sisters across the nation, dear sisters:
　　We have read the New Year's appeal from the Korean Democratic Women's League to women worldwide. This moving letter truthfully accuses the American aggressors of their barbaric crimes in Korea and demonstrates the Korean people's firm will to eliminate the American aggressors. This letter tells us the depth of disaster and suffering endured by our dear Korean brothers, sisters, and children. The beast-like American aggressors slaughter innocent Korean people, women, children, and even nursing infants, and destroy peaceful Korean towns and villages, leaving millions of Koreans hungry and cold. Women and children, lacking warm clothing and sufficient food, fall ill beside ruined walls.
　　The ferocious cruelty of the American imperialist cannibals can never subjugate the Korean people. The towering crimes committed by the aggressors have already received severe punishment. The flames of anger and revenge burn in the hearts of the Korean people. In the face of hardship, the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have launched three consecutive offensives, winning victory after victory, pursuing the enemy and advancing rapidly southward.
　　The great victories of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield have made significant contributions to defending Korea's independence, China's security, the liberation struggle of oppressed people in Asia, and the cause of peace and democracy for all mankind.
　　If not for the iron fists of our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army delivering a fatal blow to the American bandits, how could we guarantee that the claws of these man-eating beasts would not reach into our motherland's borders? If not for the great victory on the Korean battlefield, which severely struck the American aggressors' ferocious flames, how could we guarantee that we could develop our production and overall construction smoothly in a peaceful land today? And how could we guarantee that we could spend a happy New Year and welcome a victorious Spring Festival in warm homes, holding our children in our arms?
　　In this season of biting winds and swirling snow, peace-loving Chinese women will absolutely not forget the heroes on the Korean battlefield, and absolutely cannot sit idly by while our Korean friends suffer. The cause the heroes are defending and dedicating their lives to is our own cause. The suffering endured by our Korean brothers and sisters is also our own suffering.
　　Sisters across the nation! To express the heartfelt gratitude of Chinese women to the great Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and the sincere concern for our suffering Korean friends, let us take practical action to let the heroes bravely fighting in the frozen wasteland know that the eyes of all Chinese women, mothers, and children are upon them. Our encouragement, respect, and comfort will strengthen their power to more bravely annihilate the aggressors and avenge the Korean people, women, and children who died and whose blood has stained the land. Through our practical actions, let our Korean brothers and sisters who are freezing and starving in the ruins and snow know that all Chinese women are extending strong and passionate hands to them, firmly supporting them, and that all peace-loving people in China and around the world are their most loyal and trustworthy friends.
　　At this time, continuing to do our own strength and possibility, donating what they can donate something applicable to them, to comfort the Chinese and Korean soldiers and help the Korean people, is of paramount importance.
　　Sisters across the nation! While comforting the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers and aiding Korean refugees, we must also pay tribute to the families of the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers. The Spring Festival of 1951 is fast approaching, and the hardworking Chinese people value the arrival of this festival. As we celebrate the happy life of the people under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we should first think of the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers, do our best to help them solve their difficulties, and give them the most lofty respect and comfort in spirit and material terms. The heroic achievements created by the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield owe much to the patriotic mothers and patriotic wives of our volunteer soldiers. They should be respected by all Chinese people! They should be comforted by all Chinese people! They should receive the most affectionate care and help from all Chinese people!
　　Sisters of women's federations at all levels and member organizations of the All-China Women's Federation! In order to better help sisters across the country effectively carry out the work of resisting America, aiding Korea, we hope that you will support the appeal of the Korean Democratic Women's League, enthusiastically respond to the call of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, further develop the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend our country, deepen the ideological education of anti-American patriotism and internationalism, and closely integrate this work with your regular work. In the past, you have already done a lot of work in the movement to resist America and aid Korea and have achieved results. Recently, tens of thousands of women in Xuzhou, Hangzhou, Wuhan and other places have held demonstrations and parades, and signed anti-American patriotic pacts, demonstrating the women's firm will to resist America and aid Korea. Countless housewives with children in their arms have also taken to the streets, loudly shouting slogans against American imperialist aggression and in support of the Korean people. In cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, a movement to condemn American imperialist aggression has been launched, deepening the education of resisting America and aiding Korea. In the future, we should continue our efforts, consolidate our existing achievements, and implement the movement to resist America and aid Korea into our daily work.
　　Dear sisters across the nation: We hear the voices of our Korean sisters, not voices of sorrow and despair, but voices full of stronger fighting will, strength, and confidence in victory after encountering deep disasters. We should resolutely, enthusiastically, and powerfully answer them: Dear Korean sisters! Right beside you are tens of thousands of Chinese women and Chinese mothers who are fully supporting you. We firmly believe that we will win, and that all peace-loving people in the world will win.

All-China Democratic Women's Federation

　　我民主妇联向全国妇女发出号召
    声援朝鲜民主妇女总同盟的呼吁
    响应慰劳中朝战士救济朝鲜难民
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会为了声援朝鲜民主妇女总同盟致全世界妇女的呼吁书，响应中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会所发出的“关于慰劳中朝人民战士、救济朝鲜难民”的通知，特向全国妇女们发出号召，全文如下：全国妇女，亲爱的姊妹们：
    我们读到了朝鲜民主妇女总同盟新年致全世界妇女的呼吁书。这封动人心魄的书信，真实地控诉了美国侵略者在朝鲜的野蛮罪行，并且显示了朝鲜人民坚决消灭美国侵略者的战斗意志。这封信告诉我们：我们亲爱的朝鲜兄弟、姊妹和孩子们受到了何等深重的灾害与苦难。野兽一般的美国侵略者，屠杀善良的朝鲜人民，妇女儿童，甚至吃奶的婴儿。毁坏了朝鲜和平的城镇与乡村，使得千百万朝鲜人民饥饿冻馁。妇女与孩子们因为缺少御寒的衣裳与足够的食物，而病倒在断垣残壁的旁边。
    美帝国主义吃人生番们的凶暴残酷，绝不能使朝鲜人民屈服。侵略者们所制造的滔天罪行，已经受到了严厉的惩罚。朝鲜人民的胸中燃烧着愤怒与复仇的火焰。在艰难困苦的情况下，英勇的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军已连续发动了三次攻势，赢得了一个紧接着一个的胜利，追击着敌人，迅速地向南方挺进。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场上的伟大胜利，对保卫朝鲜的独立，对中国的安全，对亚洲被压迫人民的解放斗争及对全世界人类的和平民主事业都作了重大的贡献。
    假如没有我们中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军的铁拳，给美国强盗以致命的痛击，怎么能保证噬人野兽的脚爪不伸进我们祖国的边疆？假如没有朝鲜战场上的伟大胜利，严重地打击了美国侵略者的凶焰，怎么能保证我们今天能在和平的国土上，顺利地发展我们的生产和整个建设事业？更怎么能保证我们今天能在温暖的小屋中，怀抱着自己的孩子，度过愉快的新年，迎接胜利的春节呢？
    在这个朔风凛冽冰雪漫天的季节里，爱好和平的中国妇女是绝对不会忘怀朝鲜战场上的英雄，绝对不能坐视苦难中的朝鲜朋友的。英雄们所保卫的、舍身以赴的事业，就是我们自己的事业。朝鲜姊妹兄弟所受的苦难，也就是我们自己的苦难。
    全国妇女姊妹们！为了表示我们中国妇女对伟大的中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军的衷心感谢，对受苦受难的朝鲜朋友的真切关心，让我们用实际的行动，使冰天雪地中奋勇作战的英雄们知道：全中国的妇女、母亲与孩子们的眼睛都瞩望着他们。我们对他们的鼓励、敬意与慰劳，将会增强他们的力量，更勇猛地歼灭侵略者，为鲜血染红了土地的死难的朝鲜人民、妇女与儿童复仇。通过我们的实际行动，让那在废墟上风雪中冻饿交加的朝鲜姊妹兄弟们知道：全中国的妇女一直对他们伸出着雄壮而热情的手，在坚决的支持他们，全中国和全世界每一个爱好和平的人民都是他们最忠实的最可信赖的朋友。
    在这个时候，继续尽我们自己的力量与可能，捐献可能捐献的对于他们适用的东西，来慰劳中朝战士与帮助朝鲜人民，是具有头等重要的意义。
    全国妇女姊妹们！与慰劳中朝人民战士及救济朝鲜难民同时，我们必须向光荣的中国人民志愿军家属致敬。一九五一年的春节就快来到，辛勤的中国人民是重视这个节日的来临的。当我们庆贺毛主席领导下人民的幸福生活时，首先应该想到中国人民志愿军的家属，尽可能帮助他们解决困难，给她们精神、物质上最崇高的尊敬与慰劳。中国人民志愿部队在朝鲜战场上所造成的英雄业绩，其中有不少功劳应该属于我们志愿军指战员的爱国的母亲与爱国的妻子们。他们应该得到全中国人民的尊敬！应该受到全中国人民的慰劳！应该得到全中国人民最亲切的关怀与帮助！
    各级妇联以及全国妇联所属会员团体的姊妹们！为了更好地帮助全国姊妹有效地进行抗美援朝工作，希望你们声援朝鲜民主妇女总同盟的呼吁，热烈响应中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的号召，更进一步地展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动，深入反美爱国主义与国际主义的思想教育，并使这工作密切地与经常工作结合。过去你们在抗美援朝运动中已经做了很多工作，获得了成绩，最近徐州、杭州、武汉各地成千成万的妇女举行示威游行，订立反美爱国公约，显示了妇女们坚决抗美援朝的意志。无数手抱孩子的家庭主妇，也走上街头，响亮地喊出了反对美帝国主义侵略、援助朝鲜人民的口号。在京沪等城市中发动了妇女控诉美帝国主义侵略的运动，使抗美援朝的教育深入人心。今后更应继续努力，巩固已有的成绩，并把抗美援朝运动贯彻到日常工作中去。
    亲爱的全国姊妹们：我们的耳边响着朝鲜姊妹们的呼声，这不是悲痛绝望的声音，而是在遭遇了深重灾难之后充满着更坚强的战斗意志、力量和胜利信心的呼声。我们应该坚决地、热烈地、有力地回答她们：亲爱的朝鲜姊妹们！就在你们的身旁，有着千千万万的中国妇女与中国母亲在全力支持你们。我们深信我们一定会胜利，全世界爱好和平的人民一定会胜利。
            中华全国民主妇女联合会
