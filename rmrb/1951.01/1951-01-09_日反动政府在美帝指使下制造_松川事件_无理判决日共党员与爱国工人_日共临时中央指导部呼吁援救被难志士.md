　　Ouchi Shozo – (Same as above), 7 years imprisonment
　　Nikaido Sonoko – (Former Secretary of the Youth Department of the Matsukawa Labor Union of Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company), 3 and a half years imprisonment
　　Note: The so-called "Matsukawa Train Derailment Incident" is a case fabricated by the reactionary Japanese government under the direction of the American occupation authorities, using the derailment of a train in Matsukawa as an excuse to persecute Japanese Communist Party members and patriotic workers. On August 17, 1950, a train derailed near Matsukawa Station in Fukushima, killing three passengers. The reactionary authorities immediately used this incident to illegally arrest Suzuki Shin, the former chairman of the Fukushima Branch of the National Railway Workers' Union, and 19 other patriotic workers, falsely accusing them of sabotaging the railway and causing the train to derail. According to the false accusation by the Fukushima prosecutor: "Someone used a wrench to remove two railroad spikes in the dark, and one section of the rail was completely loosened, causing the train to derail." However, the wrench presented as evidence proved not to be one used by the National Railway Workers' Union. At the same time, the report submitted by the Fukushima Management Bureau of the National Railway Workers' Union to the Sendai Railway Bureau stated: "A wrench cannot possibly move a railroad spike that is pressed down with hundreds of tons of force and cause a train to derail." Although there was no legitimate basis to prove the crime, the Fukushima District Court, under the pressure of US imperialism and the Yoshida Cabinet, sentenced Suzuki Shin and others to death and imprisonment on December 6.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch] Tokyo late news: On December 7th of last year, the Japanese Communist Party Temporary Central Guidance Department issued a letter to the people of the world regarding the persecution of twenty Japanese Communist Party members and patriotic workers by the reactionary Japanese government using the Matsukawa Incident, calling on peace-loving and democratic people around the world to provide assistance. The main points of the letter are as follows:
　　Domestic and foreign fascists, in order to transform Japan into their colony and military base, have already thrown thousands of patriots into prison. Now they are brutally fabricating the Matsukawa Incident, sentencing twenty young patriots to death, life imprisonment, and long-term imprisonment. They were all outstanding fighters of the working class who bravely fought in the summer of 1949 against the massive layoffs implemented against "Kokutetsu" (abbreviation for National Railway Workers’ Union), Zendentsu, Toshiba, etc. due to military colonial policies. The domestic and foreign fascists attempted to suppress the struggle of the entire people centered on the working class, so they fabricated the Shimoyama Incident in July of the same year, and after it failed, they fabricated the Mitaka Incident. But despite these conspiracies, the struggle continued to expand, and finally, they fabricated such a brutal conspiracy as the Matsukawa Incident. It is very clear that this is a conspiratorial tactic of the same nature as the Nazi Reichstag fire incident and the Sacco and Vanzetti case (referring to the 1920 case where the US government fabricated a murder incident, arrested Italian immigrant anarchist workers Sacco and Vanzetti, and sentenced them to death, causing widespread protests from the world's working class and righteous people). This death sentence is also a sentence against the Japanese nation. People of all Japan! Peace-loving and democratic friends around the world! We expect you to defend the lives of the twenty young warriors for peace and independence, the victims of fascist tyranny, and the patriots who have been thrown into the Japanese northeastern prisons covered in deep snow. We will make every effort to fight and expect people from all countries to send strong protests to the Japanese government.

　　日反动政府在美帝指使下制造“松川事件”
    无理判决日共党员与爱国工人
    日共临时中央指导部呼吁援救被难志士
    【新华社八日讯】东京迟到消息：一九五○年十二月六日，日本反动政府福岛地方裁判所，在美帝国主义授意下，对以“松川列车颠覆事件”名义逮捕的二十名日本共产党员与爱国工人，宣告如下判决：
    铃木信——（前国营铁路工会福岛分会委员长），死刑
    本田升——（前国营铁路工会教育宣传部长），死刑
    阿部市次——（前国营铁路工会职员），死刑
    杉浦三郎——（前东京芝浦电气公司松川工会委员长），死刑
    佐藤一——（前东京芝浦电气公司鹤见工厂工人），死刑
    武田久——（前国营铁路工会福岛支部委员长），无期徒刑
    二宫丰——（前国营铁路工会福岛支部委员），无期徒刑
    高桥晴雄——（前国营铁路工会福岛分会执行委员），无期徒刑
    赤间胜美——（前国营铁路工会福岛养路区工人），无期徒刑
    太田省次——（前东京芝浦电气公司松川工会副委员长），无期徒刑
    斋藤千——（前国营铁路工会福岛支部文化部长），徒刑十五年
    滨崎二雄——（前东京芝浦电气公司松川工会执行委员），徒刑十二年
    冈田十艮松——（前国营铁路工会福岛分会书记长），徒刑十二年
    加藤谦三——（前国营铁路福岛业务区电信员），徒刑十二年
    佐藤代治——（前东京芝浦电气公司松川工会青年部长），徒刑十年
    二阶堂武夫——（前东京芝浦电气公司松川工会执行委员），徒刑十年
    小林源三郎——（前东京芝浦电气公司松川工会青年部工作人员），徒刑七年
    菊地武——（同上），徒刑七年
    大内昭三——（同上），徒刑七年
    二阶堂园子——（前东京芝浦电气公司松川工会青年部书记），徒刑三年半
    按：所谓“松川列车颠覆事件”，是日本反动政府在美国占领当局指使下借口松川地方的列车颠覆而制造的迫害日本共产党员和爱国工人的案件。一九五○年八月十七日，有一辆火车在福岛松川车站附近出轨，乘客三人死亡。反动当局即利用这一事件，非法逮捕了前国营铁路工会福岛分会委员长铃木信及其他爱国工人十九名，诬称他们破坏铁路而使火车出轨。据福岛检事的诬告中说：“有人拿螺丝钉把在黑夜拔掉了二个地方道钉，有一个地方的轨条完全松动，致使列车出轨。”但这一作为证据的螺丝钉把，证明并不是国营铁路工会所使用的。同时在国营铁路工会福岛管理局提交仙台铁道局的报告书中说：“一个螺丝钉把，不可能挖动以数百吨力量压紧的道钉，而使列车脱轨。”虽然没有任何足以证明犯罪的正当根据，但福岛地方裁判所在美帝国主义及吉田内阁的压力下，于十二月六日判决铃木信等死刑和徒刑。
    【新华社八日讯】东京迟到消息：去年十二月七日，日本共产党临时中央指导部，为日本反动政府利用松川事件迫害二十个日本共产党员和爱国工人事，特发出告全世界人民书，呼吁全世界爱好和平民主人民予以援救。该书大要如下：
    内外法西斯蒂为了变日本为其殖民地和军事基地，已将数千爱国者投入监狱。现在又暴虐地捏造松川事件，判处二十名年青的爱国者以死刑、无期徒刑与长期监禁。他们都是一九四九年夏为反对因军事殖民地政策，对以“国铁”（国营铁路工会之简称）为首的全递、东芝等实行大量裁员而英勇斗争的工人阶级的优秀斗士。内外法西斯蒂妄图抑杀以工人阶级为中心的全人民斗争，便在同年七月制造了下山事件，失败后接着又制造了三鹰事件。但是尽管有这些阴谋，斗争还是扩大着，最后便捏造了像松川事件那样残暴的阴谋。很清楚的，这是和纳粹国会纵火事件，萨科与凡齐蒂事件（按指一九二○年美国政府捏造杀人事件，逮捕意大利移民信仰无政府主义的工人萨科与凡齐蒂二人并处以死刑，引起世界工人阶级和正义人士普遍抗议的事件）同一性质的阴谋手段。这一死刑的判决，同时是对日本民族的判决。全日本的人民！全世界爱好和平民主的朋友们！我们期待各位来保卫被投入深雪掩盖中的日本东北监狱的二十名年青的和平独立的战士，法西斯暴虐下的牺牲者、爱国者的生命。我们将尽一切努力进行斗争，并期待各国人民向日本政府致送强硬的抗议。
