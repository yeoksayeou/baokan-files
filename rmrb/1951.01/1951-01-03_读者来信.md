　　Reader Letters
            Grateful for the People's Liberation Army!
            ——Reader Zhang Mingzhi's letter to the editor:
    Reader Zhang Mingzhi: Zhang Daoyou (56 years old), a villager from Yihe Village, Eighth District, Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, went to Yijun County on December 4th last year to deliver clothes to his son, Zhang Genwa (who was working as a porter in Yijun). When he stayed overnight at a hotel outside the North Gate of Yao County, he suddenly suffered from an acute illness, vomiting and diarrhea, and fell into a coma, his life in danger. Coincidentally, a comrade from the local garrison came to the store. After learning about this, he cared for Zhang Daoyou with utmost concern, personally asking for a doctor to diagnose and treat him, and serving him tea and meals. When Zhang Daoyou recovered, the comrade dissuaded him from going north, saying, "The mountain road is rugged, and there is snow, and the old man is old and can't walk well." He also paid Zhang Daoyou's hotel bill and gave him 6,000 yuan in Renminbi and ten steamed buns, and personally sent Zhang Daoyou on his way, saying, "Old man, go back! Walk slowly, rest when you are tired." Zhang Daoyou was so grateful that tears streamed down his face, and he held the comrade's hand and said, "Comrade, I will never forget the PLA's kindness to me in my life." Zhang Daoyou returned home safely on December 9th, filled with gratitude, and told everyone he met, "In my fifty-odd years, I have only seen such care for the people since I saw Chairman Mao's army; if it had been two years ago (referring to before liberation), my life would have been over."

            Protect Our Happiness ——Letter from a worker on the Tumen Railway in Northeast China to the editor:
    On December 7th of last year, I was admitted to the Fifth Sanatorium of the Tumen Locomotive Depot for recuperation due to illness. On the first night of my stay, I felt very sad and even shed tears. This is because the Tumen Sanatorium, this big red building, was a dormitory for train crew members during the puppet Manchukuo regime. I started driving trains at the age of twenty-five and ran to Tumen every day, staying in this building. Coincidentally, this time I was admitted to the sanatorium, and I stayed in a room in this building that I used to stay in often. I remembered how the Japanese devils used to oppress the Chinese, feeding the train crew sorghum rice with the husks still on; now, patients are admitted to the sanatorium for recuperation, and they have three meals of rice a day, with stir-fried dishes. Comparing the past and the present, I was so moved that I cried! I will never forget that today's happy life is inseparable from the bloody struggles of countless revolutionary martyrs and the Communist Party of China. This is the happiness that Chairman Mao brought to the railway workers of Northeast China. Today, when American imperialism is about to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting side by side to defend the motherland, so that we can recuperate in peace. Thinking of this, I, as a railway technician, am determined to complete my own tasks with the highest labor enthusiasm to support the Korean people's war against aggression. Fourteen years of suffering is endless, and we must never let the American robbers' conspiracy succeed, and we must never be slaves again! In order to defend the motherland, the Tumen Locomotive Depot voluntarily formed a blood transfusion team, and I signed up. When donating money to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers, I did my best and donated five work points. I am also willing to dedicate my life.
    Recently, Northeast Railway model workers' representatives Fang Zhizhong, Gao Xujin, Wang Jingbin, and Li Shuyou proposed that each person donate one point of their salary to comfort the Korean railway worker brothers who are working day and night and fighting bravely against American planes. The night before, the Tumen Branch of the Northeast Railway Bureau held a mobilization meeting. The next morning, I handed over one point of money to the union group leader.
    The movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country is being vigorously carried out at the Tumen Locomotive Depot.

            The Datong Office of the Fuel Industry Ministry's Business Department Repeatedly Fails to Execute Contracts, Causing Losses to the State Editor:
    The Datong Office of the Business Department of the Central People's Government's Fuel Industry Ministry has repeatedly failed to execute contracts, causing the Zhangjiakou Branch of the Coal Construction Company to fail to achieve its plans and causing undue losses to our company and the masses. The facts are as follows:
    The Business Department of the Ministry signed a contract in July last year to supply 80,000 tons of Datong lump coal to the Coal Construction Company, delivered on the truck, to be completed by the end of December of this year. However, the Datong Office stopped supplying according to the contract in September. In fact, the mines have a lot of coal in stock. The Majiliang Mine alone has about 15,000 tons of lump coal. The office, fearing increased costs, resolutely refused to transport it to the switches. Other mines also produced a lot of lump coal, but they only cared about selling it at the kiln and fulfilling other contracts. Therefore, the contract became a formality. Although our company repeatedly urged them, they ignored us.
    Because the above contract could not be executed, and the demand for coal along the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway was urgent, the Datong Mining Bureau, the Coal Construction Company, and the Datong Office of the Business Department jointly studied the situation on October 31st and re-signed a supply method to take into account the production and sales situation. All three parties were responsible for signing and sealing (the previous contract was not invalidated). In November, the Datong Office guaranteed to supply the Coal Construction Company with 10,000 tons of lump coal above 2.5 inches and 10,000 tons of good mixed coal (the delivered lump coal could be counted as the quantity of the 80,000-ton contract). However, after execution, not only was the lump coal not delivered according to the contract, but the specifications of the mixed coal were also lowered (the mixed coal from a few years ago was dark in color and contained a lot of ash and soil, making it unsellable), otherwise there would be no coal to load. In order to implement the vehicle plan and prevent the waste of wagons, the company had to load it. Therefore, the contract became empty talk again.
    The previous contract and minutes were all just formalities and empty talk. On November 24th, another solemn contract was signed to supply 10,000 tons of coal from the Majiliang Mine (including 7,000 tons of large lumps and 3,000 tons of small charcoal), to be fully delivered by the end of December. The company was not responsible if it could not transport it. In order to actively complete the task and supply coal to various places in a planned way to solve the coal shortage, the company had to organize its own carts and work with the cart owners to repair and patch the roads. During the hauling process, the scales at the Majiliang Coal Plant of the office were too few to handle the volume, so the cart owners had to wait from dawn until 4 or 5 pm to load their carts. The cart owners could not make a trip in two days, so many of them stopped hauling. Although the company explained in many ways, many people still quit. Until November 20th, the road had been repaired, but the office sold all the lump coal that had been ordered by the company to carters more than a hundred miles away and transported it to Tianzhen, Yanggao, and Fengzhen for 42 yuan per catty for its own use and 49 yuan for resale. Some of it was for their own use, and some was sold to coal merchants for distribution in other places. Therefore, the company only hauled more than two thousand, nearly three thousand tons before there was no lump coal to haul. The carters went to the mine and could not load coal, returning empty, suffering undue losses. Later, with the help of the mine area government, they hauled it at a ratio of four lumps to three mixed, and the Huangtugou lumps were distributed to some of them, but the lumps stored there would be used up in a few days, so what would happen then? In addition, the factory did not give enough weight when issuing coal, so the carters suffered too much loss in weight, some even losing two or three hundred catties. As a result, the carters complained and quit hauling one after another, and this 10,000-ton contract became empty talk again.
    Most of the mines under the Mining Bureau also asked the office to quickly organize carters to transport coal so as not to affect production. From this, it can be seen that it is not that the mines cannot produce coal, but that the Datong Office consciously refuses to execute the contract. The result of the Datong Office of the Business Department of the Central People's Government's Fuel Industry Ministry treating the contract as child's play is the following main losses:
    1. According to the monthly delivery tasks of the contract, the company's monthly wagon plan to the Railway Bureau could not be executed according to the contract, resulting in a waste of wagon turnover, which disrupted the Railway Bureau's plan and our company's business plan, leading to a coal shortage.
    2. In order to execute the contract task, the company equipped a large number of cadres and escorts, which also suffered undue losses in staffing and quotas.
    3. The company spent a lot of effort to organize more than 400 ox and horse carts to haul lump coal, and the carts returned empty, causing losses to the cart owners and adding many difficulties to the future organization of cart owners.
    The Datong Office is so untrustworthy that it has caused undue losses to the property of the state and the people. We make a public criticism. And please check it, and publish the handling method in the newspaper.

            保卫我们的幸福  ——东北图们铁路工人来信编辑同志：
    年去十二月七日，我因病入图们机务段第五休养所休养。入所的第一天晚上，我感到很难过，甚至流了泪。因为图们休养所这座大红楼，在伪满时是乘务员宿舍。我由二十五岁开车，每天跑图们，就住在这个楼里。无巧不成书，这次入所，我又住在这楼中的一个我过去经常住的屋子里。想起过去日本鬼子压迫中国人，给乘务员吃带皮的高粱饭；现在病员入院休养，每天三餐大米饭，还有炒菜。今昔对比，感动得使我哭了！我永远不会忘记今天幸福的生活，是和无数革命先烈流血斗争分不开的，是和中国共产党分不开的，这是毛主席给东北铁路工人带来的幸福。当美帝国主义又要走日本帝国主义的老路的今天，中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军的并肩作战，保卫了祖国，使我们能安心休养。想到这里，我，作为一个铁路技工，决心要用最高的劳动热忱来完成我本身的任务，支援朝鲜人民反侵略战争。十四年的苦难是说不完的，我们决不能叫美国强盗的阴谋得逞，我们决不再当亡国奴！为了保卫祖国，图们机务段志愿组成输血队，我也报了名。在捐款慰劳中国人民志愿军时，我尽我的力量，捐了五工分。我并愿献出我的生命。
    最近东北铁路劳模代表方致中、高续进、王静彬、李树有提议：每人献出一分工资来慰问日以继夜地工作、与美帝飞机英勇斗争的朝鲜铁路工人兄弟。头天晚上，东北铁路总局图们分局开动员大会。第二天早晨，我就把一分的钱交给了工会小组长。
    抗美援朝保家卫国运动在图们机务段正在热烈展开着。

            燃料工业部经理司大同办事处  屡次不执行合同  造成国家的损失编者同志：
    中央人民政府燃料工业部经理司大同办事处，屡次不执行合同，致使煤建公司张家口分公司计划不能实现，并使我公司和群众均遭受了不应有的损失。其事实经过是这样的：
    该部经理司在去年七月间签订了供应煤建公司大同块煤八万吨合同，车上交货，限定本年十二月底完成。但执行至九月份大同办事处即不按照合同规定供应。实际矿方存煤很多，仅马脊梁矿约存煤大块一万五千吨，该处唯恐加大成本，坚决不往道岔运送，其它各矿产块也属不少，而只顾了窑口出售，和交付其它合同，因此使合同流于形式，我公司虽再三催要，他们却置之不理。
    由于上述合同不能执行，而京绥沿线用煤火急，乃于十月三十一日经由大同矿务局、煤建公司、经理司大同办事处三方共同研究，为了照顾产销情况重新签立供应办法，并由三方负责签盖（前项合同并不作废）在十一月份大同办事处保证给煤建公司二英寸五以上块煤一万吨，好混煤一万吨（所交块煤可作为八万吨合同数量）。而执行以后，非但块煤不能按照合同交付，连混煤也降低了规格（几年前的混煤煤色灰土份多卖不了），否则无煤可装。公司为了贯彻要车计划不使车皮浪费，只得装运，因此合同又形成空谈。
    上次的合同及纪要都流于形式与空谈，复于十一月二十四再度郑重签订由马脊梁矿交煤一万吨合同（其中大块七千吨籽炭三千吨），限定十二月底全部交完，公司无力运输时不在此限。公司为了积极完成任务有计划地供应各地用煤解决煤荒，只好自己组织脚车并与脚户共同修、补公路。在拉运中该处马脊梁煤厂秤子太少，过不出来，使车户由东方刚亮等至下午四、五点钟还装不了车，车户两天还拉不了一趟，于是纷纷不拉，虽经公司多方解释，但退拉者仍属不少。直至十一月二十日公路已经修妥，而该处竟将已经订售公司之块煤全部以自用每斤四十二元运销四十九元售给百里以外的车户运往天镇、阳高、丰镇等地，其中也有自用的，也有售给煤商运往外地经销的，因此公司只拉运了两千多近三千吨便无块可拉了。车户上矿无煤可装，空车而返，受了不应有的损失。后经矿区政府解决以块四混三拉运，乃把黄土沟块发给一部，但该处存块三两天即将用完，又将如何？另外该厂在发煤中不给够分量，使车户运来亏秤太大，有的竟亏到二、三百斤。这样一来，车户叫苦连连，纷纷退运，这个一万吨合同又成为纸上空谈了。
    矿务局多数矿也纷纷要求该处迅速组织脚户运煤，以免影响生产。这样说来，可以知道并不是矿方产不出煤来，而是大同办事处有意识地不执行。中央人民政府燃料工业部经理司大同办事处把合同当做儿戏的结果，造成以下主要的损失：
    一、根据合同逐月交付任务，公司每月向路局所作的要车计划因不能按合同执行造成车皮周转上浪费，既打乱了路局计划也打乱了我们公司的经营计划，形成煤荒。
    二、公司为了执行合同任务，配备了多数干部及押运员，在定员定额上也受了不应有的损失。
    三、公司为拉运块煤费力组织了四百多牛马车，空车往返，车户受了损失，并给今后组织脚户上，增加了许多困难。
    大同办事处如此不讲信用，使国家人民财产遭受不应有的损失，我们提出公开批评。并请其检查，以及将处理办法在报纸上公开答复。
