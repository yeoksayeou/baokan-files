Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 21st: The seven-month coal and electricity saving production competition between the Qingdao and Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureaus concluded at the end of December last year, with the Qingdao Electric Power Bureau ultimately winning. The coal and electricity consumption of both bureaus were below the standards set by the Central Fuel Industry Department in 1950. Coal consumption for power generation was 10.6% less for the Qingdao Bureau and 9.8% less for the Southern Jiangsu Bureau; electricity consumption for plant use was 26.63% less for the Qingdao Bureau and 11.02% less for the Southern Jiangsu Bureau. During this competition, the two bureaus regularly informed each other of their competition results and exchanged delegations to observe and learn from each other, sharing experiences to promote active production among workers and staff, achieving a common improvement. During the competition, the trade unions led the workers and staff in signing collective contracts with the administrative side on safe power generation and reduced coal consumption, thereby smoothly promoting and consolidating systems such as shift handover and operating procedures. The competition was judged in three stages, and in the two evaluations conducted at the end of July and the end of September last year, each bureau won once. To further improve on the existing basis, the two bureaus are continuing to expand this type of inter-bureau production competition. Since November last year, the Southern Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau has launched a patriotic competition with the Jinan and Nanjing Electric Power Bureaus for safe power transmission. The Qingdao Electric Power Plant Trade Union Congress has passed a resolution to compete with the Tangshan Power Plant, which has set a new national coal consumption record, this year. The plant's trade union organized a delegation to visit and learn from the Tangshan Power Plant on the 4th of this month.

　　青岛苏南电业局省煤省电竞赛
    青岛电业局最后获胜
    【新华社上海二十一日电】青岛、苏南两电业局间，为期七个月的省煤省电的生产竞赛已于去年十二月底结束，青岛电业局最后获胜。两局所耗煤、电都在中央燃料工业部一九五○年所规定的标准以下。发电煤耗，青岛局少百分之十点六，苏南局少百分之九点八；厂用电，青岛局少百分之二十六点六三，苏南局少百分之十一点零二。两局在此次竞赛中，经常互相通报竞赛成绩，并曾互派代表团观摩学习，交流经验，推动工人职员积极生产，达到共同提高的效果。工会在竞赛中曾领导工人职员先后与行政方面订立了安全发电、降低煤耗等集体合同，因而顺利地推行并巩固了交接班和运转规程等制度。这次竞赛分三个阶段进行评判，在去年七月底、九月底进行的两次评判中，两局各获胜一次。为了在原有的基础上继续提高一步，两局正继续扩大此种局与局之间的生产竞赛。苏南电业局自去年十一月起，就又与济南、南京两电业局展开安全发送电的爱国竞赛。青岛电业局发电厂工会会员大会已通过决议，今年要和再创全国煤耗新纪录的唐山电厂竞赛。该厂工会已于本月四日组织代表团前往唐山电厂参观学习。
