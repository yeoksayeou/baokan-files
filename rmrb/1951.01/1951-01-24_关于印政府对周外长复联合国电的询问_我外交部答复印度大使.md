Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: On January 21st, the Indian Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, K.M. Panikkar, submitted a memorandum to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Indian government, inquiring about several points in Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram reply to Mr. Ablahaz, Chairman of the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, on January 17th. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government gave the following reply to Ambassador Panikkar on January 22nd:

　　1. Once the principle of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is accepted and implemented, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will be responsible for persuading the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to return to their country.

　　2. We believe that the cessation of the Korean War and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue can be carried out in two steps.

　　The first step is that a limited ceasefire can be agreed upon and implemented in the first meeting of the Seven-Nation Conference, in order to continue negotiations;

　　The second step is that in order to completely end the Korean War and guarantee peace in East Asia, all terms of the armistice must be discussed in connection with political issues and agreed upon: the steps and methods for withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea; suggestions to the Korean people on how to implement the steps and methods for the Korean people to resolve their own internal affairs; in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, the withdrawal of American armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait; and issues related to the Far East.

　　3. The determination of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be guaranteed.

　　关于印政府对周外长复联合国电的询问
    我外交部答复印度大使
    【新华社二十三日讯】一月二十一日印度驻中华人民共和国大使潘尼迦代表印度政府向我外交部提出备忘录一件，对我周外长一月十七日复联合国大会第一委员会主席阿彼拉兹先生电中的几点有所询问。我中央人民政府外交部当于一月二十二日对潘尼迦大使答复如下：
    一、只要一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退的原则被接受后，并付诸实施，中华人民共和国中央人民政府将负责劝说中国人民志愿部队回到本国。
    二、我们认为关于停止朝鲜战争，与和平调处朝鲜问题，可分两个步骤进行。
    第一个步骤，可在七国会议第一次会议中商定有限期的停火，并付诸实施，以便继续进行谈判；
    第二个步骤，为欲达到完全结束朝鲜战争并保证东亚和平，停战全部条件必须与政治问题联系讨论，商定：从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的步骤和办法；向朝鲜人民建议如何实施朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决的步骤和办法；依据开罗宣言及波茨坦公告，美国武装力量自台湾及台湾海峡撤退；以及远东有关诸问题。
    三、中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的确定必须得到保证。
