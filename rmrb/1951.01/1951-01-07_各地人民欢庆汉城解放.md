People Everywhere Celebrate the Liberation of Seoul

The good news of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers liberating Seoul has reached us, and sounds of victory are resounding throughout the country. People everywhere are enthusiastically holding victory parades and sending telegrams to the Chinese and North Korean soldiers on the front lines to express their respect.

On the 5th, from morning till night, Shanghai was filled with the sound of firecrackers celebrating the victory. The huge loudspeaker on the radio station building continuously broadcast the good news to the general public. The national flags of China and North Korea and huge red flags bearing the good news fluttered atop many buildings. Moviegoers greeted the screening of newsreels about the heroic resistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers against the United States with thunderous applause. Parades of celebration and musical bands from various schools and organizations continuously appeared on the streets, cheering "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live General Kim Il-sung!".

The people of major cities in North China were elated by the liberation of Seoul. In Tianjin, bright red national flags were hung in the windows of every street and lane. Forty-nine military families in the Sixth District donated money on the same day to buy慰劳品(comfort items) and sent them to the district office for forwarding to the Seoul front lines. Li Zhuchen, director of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "As American imperialism suffers repeated defeats, it is still bombing our Andong and massacring large numbers of Korean residents. We will not forget this blood debt. We must move forward and drive American imperialism into the sea!" When the good news of the liberation of Seoul reached the cities of Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, and Guihua, the military and civilians in these places enthusiastically gathered to celebrate and hold victory parades. Kim Tae-hwan, a Korean doctor at the Taiyuan Municipal Hospital, said excitedly: "The Korean people will never forget that the restoration of Seoul is due to the brotherly friendship and assistance of the Chinese people." All the workers in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Department of the Zhangjiakou Machine and Electrical Plant decided to celebrate the victory by shortening the production time of each coal car wheel by three working hours, eliminating waste products, and overfulfilling the January task. More than a thousand representatives from various agencies, organizations, and ethnic groups stationed in Zhangjiakou in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region sent congratulatory telegrams to the heroes on the Korean front at the celebration meeting. People from all walks of life in Guihua wrote letters to express their appreciation to the Chinese and North Korean soldiers. The staff of the city's telecommunications bureau donated a large number of comfort items and wrote letters to express their appreciation to the people of Seoul who had been liberated. Soldiers of a certain unit of the North China Military Region stationed on the front line of coastal defense paraded through the streets in the piercing sea breeze and heavy snow, holding high banners celebrating the liberation of Seoul.

In the Central and Southern regions of Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Nanning and other places, students from schools enthusiastically carried out street propaganda and propaganda in nearby rural areas to celebrate this great victory. The Changsha Volunteer Medical Surgery Team, which was about to depart, said that they would go to the Korean front line to serve the wounded and sick Chinese and North Korean soldiers well. Various democratic parties and people's organizations in Henan Province sent telegrams to the Chinese and North Korean soldiers to congratulate them.

People from all ethnic groups and circles in Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Xining in the Northwest region unanimously praised the brave and skillful fighting of the Korean and Chinese soldiers. More than a thousand students gathering in Xi'an to take entrance examinations for military cadre schools and more than three hundred young people of various ethnic groups in Lanzhou who applied for the examinations excitedly expressed that they would learn from the example of the Chinese and North Korean soldiers. Huang Xiang and Ma Peiqing, representatives of the Tibetan and Hui ethnic groups who attended the World Peace Conference, said that they would actively launch the Resist America and Aid Korea movement among their own ethnic groups.

More than 500,000 railway workers across the country celebrated the liberation of Seoul with jubilation. Many model train crews at the Sujiatun Station in Northeast China and the Fengtai Station in Beijing proposed to celebrate the victory with more over-axle kilometers.
