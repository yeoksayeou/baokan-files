Sequel to the Truman Scandal

　　The scandal of U.S. President Truman writing a letter to threaten "Washington Post" music critic Paul Hume with extremely filthy language was reported in this newspaper on the 13th of this month. This matter has become a considerable political storm in recent domestic American life. The people involved in this "incident," such as Hume, Margaret Truman, Pegler, etc., have their own different reactions to Truman's dirty letter. Music critic Hume, after receiving the letter signed "H.S.T," immediately ran to consult with James R. Wiggins, the editor-in-chief of the Washington Post. They decided to return the letter to the White House with a very polite reply. But the story of this letter quickly spread, and the next afternoon, a Washington tabloid, the "News," published it on the front page.
　　Margaret Truman, the president's daughter who was criticized for not singing "very well," heard about the incident while traveling and singing in Nashville, but she told the person who informed her, "I absolutely believe my father would not use language like that... First of all, my father wouldn't have time to write letters!..."
　　But soon after, the White House confirmed that the filthy letter was indeed written by the President, and Miss Truman remained silent.
　　Pegler, who was called a "son of a bitch," retorted with curses, saying: "This is simply a great tragedy, especially at this terrible moment, the American people must accept... a president's obscene malicious retaliation... This president, as Bernard Baruch scolded... is a vulgar, filthy, and ignorant little man. Let us curse him!"
　　Of course, this is not the only scandal in U.S. President Truman's life. Among the many scandals that have already occurred, there are even more unspeakable ones!

　　杜鲁门丑闻续志
    美国总统杜鲁门以极其肮脏的语句写信恐吓“华盛顿邮报”音乐批评家保罗·休谟的丑闻，本报在本月十三日曾有报道。这件事在最近美国国内的政治生活中已成为不小的风波。牵涉在这个“事件”中的人物，如休谟，玛格丽·杜鲁门，沛格勒等人，对杜鲁门这封肮脏的信是各有其不同的反应的。音乐评论家休谟在接到署名“Ｈ·Ｓ·Ｔ”的信以后，曾立即跑去和华盛顿邮报的总编辑杰姆士·Ｒ·魏金斯商量。他们决定将这封信退回白宫并附上一封措辞极客气的回信。但是这封信的故事很快就传开了，第二天下午华盛顿的一个小报“新闻报”在第一版刊登了它。
    玛格丽·杜鲁门，这位被批评唱歌“唱的不大好”的总统的小姐，在奈西威里作旅行歌唱时听说了这件事，但她告诉向她报信的人说：“我绝对相信我爸爸不会使用像这样的语言。……首先，我爸爸不会有写信的时间啊！……”
    但是不久以后，白宫证实了那封下流的信恰正是总统写的，杜鲁门小姐缄口不语了。
    那位被骂为“这婊子养的”的沛格勒，则还以恶骂，他说：“这简直是一个很大的悲剧，特别在可怕的现在这一时刻，美国人民必须接受……一位总统的猥亵的恶意报复……这位总统呢，正如贝尔纳·巴鲁区所责骂的……是一位粗鄙的、丑臭无比的、无知的小人。让我们咒他吧！”
    当然，这并不是美国总统杜鲁门一生中唯一的丑事，在许多已经发生过的丑事中还有比这个更不堪闻问的哩！
