　　Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: Truman presented his annual budget message to the US Congress on the 15th, indicating that the US ruling clique is pushing the national economy onto an irreparable path of disaster.

　　In his message, Truman requested Congress to appropriate $71,594,000,000 for the 1951-52 fiscal year (from July 1st of this year to June 30th of next year), and requested Congress to approve new contractual rights of $22,835,000,000. The above two items total approximately $94,500,000,000. According to Truman's message, 69 percent of the above huge budget appropriation, or $48,882,200,000, will be directly used for US military expansion and war preparations at home and abroad, and other various expenditures indirectly used for military purposes are not included.

　　In order to appease the increasingly centrifugal Western European vassal states, Truman declared in his budget message that the United States will continue to implement the so-called Marshall Plan's "aid" after 1952 (the year originally scheduled for the end of the Marshall Plan). However, this so-called "aid" will only be allowed for military purposes, not for "general economic expansion."

　　Due to the huge increase in military expenditures, even Truman had to admit in his message that although "expenses in non-defense government activities have decreased" and tax rates will be greatly increased, the US government's fiscal deficit will still be as high as $16,500,000,000. Therefore, Truman asked the American people to "make huge sacrifices for many years to come—down to saving towels and tablecloths," and asked the American people to "bear heavier tax burdens than those imposed on them this year" and "even greater national debt."

　　Truman's war preparation budget shows that the US government is using means of further reducing the people's living standards and further exploiting the American people to conduct a frantic arms race. However, the result of this destructive military production will inevitably push the US economy into a severe inflation and an abyss of disaster. Therefore, the presentation of this huge military budget will not only be strongly opposed by the American people, but will also cause more debates and divisions within the ruling class. Currently, attacks on Truman's budget message have begun in the US Congress. Republican leaders Martin and Taber, in a joint statement, attacked Truman for "shamelessly requesting funds needed to carry out these programs under the resounding name of defense." Republican Reed complained: "The main tone of Truman's message is still 'taxes and more taxes, spending and more spending.'" Reed announced: "We will not pass another tax bill while the President allows inflation to continue and the government's money spenders are still squandering money."

### 把美国经济驱入灾难的深渊  杜鲁门提出预算咨文  巨大拨款将用于扩军备战

　　把美国经济驱入灾难的深渊
    杜鲁门提出预算咨文   
    巨大拨款将用于扩军备战
    【新华社十七日讯】杜鲁门于十五日向美国国会提出一年一度的预算咨文，表明美国统治集团正把国家经济推上无法收拾的灾难性道路。
    杜鲁门在咨文中要求国会为一九五一——五二财政年度（自今年七月一日到明年六月三十日）拨款七百一十五亿九千四百万美元，并要求国会通过新的签订合同权项下的二百二十八亿三千五百万美元。上述两项合计，共约达九百四十五亿美元。根据杜鲁门的咨文，在上述巨大的预算拨款中，百分之六十九即四百八十八亿八千二百万美元，将直接用于美国在国内外的扩军备战计划上，而其他间接用于军事目的的各种支出，尚未计算在内。
    为了拢络离心倾向日益明显的西欧仆从国家，杜鲁门在预算咨文中声言：美国将于一九五二年（马歇尔计划原定结束的一年）以后继续实施所谓马歇尔计划的“援助”。但是，此后的这种所谓“援助”，将只许用于军事目的而不是用于“一般的经济扩充”上。
    由于军事开支的巨大增加，甚至连杜鲁门也不得不在咨文中承认：尽管“非国防的政府活动方面费用有所减少”和税率将大为加重，但美国政府的财政赤字，仍将高达一百六十五亿美元。因此，杜鲁门要求美国人民：“今后多少年都须作巨大牺牲——直到省用毛巾和桌布”，并要求美国人民“将承担比本年度加于他们的还更要沉重的捐税负担”和“更加巨大的国债”。
    杜鲁门的备战预算表明：美国政府正以更加降低人民生活水平和更加压榨美国人民的手段，以进行疯狂的军备竞赛。但这种破坏性的军事生产的结果，必将把美国经济驱入严重的通货膨胀和灾难的深渊。因此，这一庞大军事预算的提出，不仅将受到美国人民的强烈反对，而且将在统治阶级内部引起更多的争辩和分歧。目前，美国国会中已展开了对杜鲁门预算咨文的攻击。共和党首脑之一马丁和泰伯在联合发表的声明中，攻击杜鲁门“在国防的响亮名声之下厚颜无耻地要求为进行这些方案所需的款项”。共和党人李德埋怨说：“杜鲁门咨文的主要调子仍是‘税收又税收、开支又开支’。”李德宣布：“在总统听任通货膨胀不已并且政府的用钱的人还是挥霍不已的时候，我们不通过另一个税收法案”。
