　　The Catholic Church's Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement is Increasingly Developing
    Sui Catholic Church Establishes Patriotic Promotion Association
    To Achieve Self-Sufficiency, a Decision is Made to Establish Various Production Organizations
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the 120,000 to 130,000 Catholics in Suiyuan Province launched the patriotic movement last December, it has now entered a new stage.

    Since the People's Daily published the news of the reform movement of Suiyuan Catholics and the declaration of the Three-Self Reform Movement by the GuiSui City Catholic Church in an important position on January 5th, and published an editorial entitled "Welcome the Patriotic Movement of Catholic Personages" on the 8th, it has brought great excitement and encouragement to the vast number of Catholics in Suiyuan. Father Hu Ruhan, the principal of Hengqing Middle School, said with emotion: "For the government and the People's Daily's enthusiastic help and encouragement to us, we should not only deeply thank them, but also mobilize all parishioners to dedicate their greatest strength and plunge into the upsurge of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes, and defending our country."

    On January 8th, the Suiyuan Diocese established the Suiyuan Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Promotion Committee, electing Gao Ruoshan (priest) as director, Hu Ruhan and Zhao Denglian as deputy directors, Guo Zhengji as director of the propaganda department, and Li Congzhe and others as committee members. In order to achieve self-sufficiency, the Promotion Committee decided to expand production and establish enterprises such as flour mills, grinding mills, and textile factories under the leadership of the state-owned economy. For peasant parishioners, they are expected to work hard to improve production, reduce rent, and carry out land reform.

    The Suiyuan Philosophical Seminary, jointly sponsored by the seven dioceses of Rehe, Chahar, Datong, Chifeng, Jining, Ningxia, and Suiyuan, currently has more than 60 students, most of whom are recommended by church schools (high schools) in Beijing and Tianjin. After graduating from the Philosophy Institute, they will be assigned to work in various dioceses in North China. Their thoughts and actions are sufficient to influence many Catholics. They have all expressed their active support for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Han Jinxue, chairman of the school's student union, said: "In the past, because we had little contact with the outside world, we inevitably had some doubts about the government's religious policy. This Three-Self Movement has enabled us to further understand the government's religious policy, and we feel very happy. The People's Daily's commendation and guidance of our movement has made us even more inexplicably happy. The Chinese church should be self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. It would be most shameful if it were used by imperialism, especially American imperialism." Since the liberation of Suiyuan, the students of the institute have unanimously and urgently demanded to understand current affairs and study revolutionary theory, and have finished reading "On New Democracy" in a short period of time. Now, the "University Chinese" published by Xinhua Bookstore is used for the Chinese language class, and recently, editorials of the People's Daily and propaganda materials for resisting America and aiding Korea have been selected as teaching materials. Through study, the students have generally established a labor perspective, and in order to effectively implement self-sufficiency, they have organized seven production groups, using their spare time to cultivate more than 30 mu of garden land, and built a two-li long canal to solve the drinking water problem. In addition, they are also engaged in small-scale industrial production such as repairing bicycles and clocks.

    More than 110 faculty members of church schools throughout the province, in order to further carry out the reform movement and thoroughly eliminate the influence of American cultural aggression, have gathered in Guisui City for study under the leadership and help of the Provincial Department of Culture and Education. The main documents for study include the People's Daily editorial "The Patriotic Movement of Christian Personages" of September 23, 1950, and the editorial of January 8th this year, as well as Current Affairs Handbook, "The Patriotic Movement of Christian Personages" published by Xinhua Bookstore, etc. Among the students, there are 85 Catholics and 14 Christians. In the discussions, they used concrete facts to expose the conspiracy of imperialism, especially American imperialism, to use religion and running church schools as a guise to carry out cultural aggression in China.

    40,000 Catholics in the SuiXi (Ningxia) Diocese have expressed their support for the call of Catholics in this province and other places to resist America, aid Korea, and carry out the reform movement. On January 6th, more than 350 Catholics in Shanba held a Three-Self Reform Movement and Resist America, Aid Korea Propaganda Meeting. Bishop Wang Shouli (Belgian), who attended the meeting, expressed his warm support for the Three-Self Movement in his speech. On the spot, Fu Tingwei (Vicar General), Sun Zhongxian, and Zhou Qizhi, the priests in charge of the Shanba District Church, drafted the Three-Self Movement Declaration, which was unanimously adopted by all parishioners. More than 1,200 people have signed the declaration.

    More than 42,000 Catholics in the SuiDong (Jining) Diocese have also expressed their warm support for the Three-Self Reform Movement. More than 800 Catholics in Lao Pingdiquan held a patriotic demonstration parade on New Year's Day. More than 400 Catholics in Baotou City, SuiZhong Diocese, signed and issued the Three-Self Reform Movement Declaration on January 14th. More than 5,000 Catholics in the Liangcheng Diocese also issued a declaration in response to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. The Catholics also donated condolence items to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. A batch of towels, socks, soap, tooth soap, toothbrushes, and toothpaste has now been received.

　　天主教徒三自革新运动日益开展
    绥天主教组爱国促进会
    为实现自养决定筹设各种生产组织
    【本报讯】绥远省十二万到十三万的天主教徒，自去年十二月开展爱国运动以来，目前已进入新的阶段。
    自从人民日报一月五日在重要地位刊出绥远天主教徒革新运动和归绥市天主教发表三自革新运动宣言的消息，并于八日发表了以“欢迎天主教人士的爱国运动”为题的社论后，更给绥远广大的天主教人士带来了莫大的兴奋与鼓舞。恒清中学校长胡濡翰神父感动地说：“对于政府和人民日报给我们这般热情的帮助和勉励，我们除了深深地感谢外，更应当动员所有教友，献出最大的力量，投入抗美援朝保家卫国运动的热潮中。”
    绥远教区于一月八日成立了绥远天主教徒三自爱国促进委员会，选出高若山（司铎）为主任，胡濡翰、赵登廉为副主任，郭正基为宣传部长，李从哲等九人为委员。促进委员会为了实行自养，决定扩大生产，在国营经济领导之下，筹设粉坊、磨坊、纺织厂等企业组织。对于农民教徒，则希望他们为搞好生产、减租和土地改革而努力。
    由热河、察哈尔、大同、赤峰、集宁、宁夏和绥远七个教区主办的绥远哲学修道院，现有学生六十多人，其中大部分是由北京、天津的教会学校（高中）保送的。他们在哲学院毕业以后，将被分配至华北各教区工作。他们的思想行动足以影响许多教徒。他们对三自爱国运动，都表示积极拥护。该校学生会主席韩进学说：“过去由于我们和外界接触少，对政府的宗教政策不免有所怀疑，经过这次三自运动，使我们进一步了解了政府的宗教政策，心里非常痛快。而人民日报对我们这一运动予以表扬和指导，更使我们有说不出的快乐。中国教会是应当自治、自养、自传的，如果被帝国主义特别是美帝国主义利用，那是最可耻的。”自绥远解放以后，该院同学一致迫切要求了解时事，学习革命理论，在短时期内读完了“新民主主义论”。现在国文课采用了新华书店出版的“大学国文”，最近更选用人民日报社论和抗美援朝的宣传资料作为教材。同学们通过学习，普遍建立了劳动观点，并为了切实实行自养，他们组织了七个生产小组，利用课余时间，开垦了三十多亩园地，又修建了一条二里长的水渠，解决了饮水问题。此外还从事小手工业生产像修理自行车、钟表等。
    全省各地教会学校教职员一百一十余人，为了进一步开展革新运动，彻底肃清美帝文化侵略的影响，在省文教厅领导和帮助之下，已集中在归绥市进行学习。学习的主要文件有人民日报一九五○年九月二十三日“基督教人士的爱国运动”社论、和今年一月八日的社论以及时事手册、新华书店出版的“基督教人士的爱国运动”等。学员中计天主教徒八十五人，基督教徒十四人。他们在讨论会中，用具体的事实揭露了帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在中国利用宗教和办教会学校作幌子，进行文化侵略的阴谋。
    绥西（宁夏）教区四万天主教徒纷纷表示响应本省和各地天主教友抗美援朝和革新运动的号召。一月六日，陕坝天主教徒三百五十余人，召开了三自革新运动暨抗美援朝宣传大会。列席大会的王守礼主教（比利时人）在发言中表示热烈拥护三自运动。当场由陕坝区教会负责司铎傅亭维（副主教）、孙仲贤、周其智三人起草三自运动宣言，获得全体教友的一致通过。在宣言上签名的已有一千二百余人。
    绥东（集宁）教区四万二千多教徒也同样表示热烈响应三自革新运动。老平地泉八百余天主教徒在元旦日举行了爱国示威大游行。绥中教区包头市天主教徒四百余人在一月十四日签名发表了三自革新运动宣言。凉城教区五千余教徒也发表宣言响应三自爱国运动。教徒们并纷纷捐赠慰劳品，慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，现在已经收到一批毛巾、袜子、肥皂、香皂、牙刷和牙粉。
