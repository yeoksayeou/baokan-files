　　U.S. Imperialism Uses Other Countries' Armies as Cannon Fodder
    Internal Fighting Among the Aggressor Troops in Korea
    MacArthur Plans to Purge Morale-Depleted Units
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 28th] TASS, The Hague, January 27th: *Pravda* published a report from its London correspondent regarding recent events between the American and British invading forces. The correspondent writes: Officials in the British Ministry of Defence are aware that MacArthur ordered General Ridgway, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, and General Almond, commander of the Tenth Corps, not to use American forces on the front lines to cover retreats, but rather to use troops from other countries for this task. American staff officers often order troops from other countries to hold strategically disadvantageous positions, resulting in the near-total annihilation of these units. The American troops never provide support to the troops covering the American retreat.

    The correspondent also reported on serious incidents occurring within the ranks of the aggressor forces. Under the pretext of providing artillery support to the accomplice forces performing covering duties, the U.S. military intentionally used artillery fire to cut off the retreat routes of these troops. Infuriated British and other national troops frequently fired upon trucks transporting American soldiers fleeing to the rear. The *Pravda* correspondent reported that the commander of the British invading forces in Korea has reported these incidents to the British Minister of Defence, Shinwell.

    [Xinhua News Agency, January 28th] Anti-war and anti-American sentiments are widespread among the troops from various accomplice nations, who are being used as cannon fodder by the U.S. military authorities in Korea. MacArthur is trying to purge them. According to Dentsu News Agency, Washington, January 26th: MacArthur has proposed purging "panic-mongering" elements from the non-American forces participating in the Korean War. In a special report to Truman, MacArthur stated: It is necessary to discuss with the relevant national governments the partial or complete replacement of those units where desertion, insubordination, and other phenomena have reached extreme levels. Dentsu News Agency reports that U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating the morale and combat value of the non-American forces participating in the "United Nations forces in Korea." These investigations conducted by U.S. intelligence reveal that in recent times, the morale of soldiers from the British, Canadian, Australian, and other accomplice armies on the Korean front, and even the morale of some officers, has further deteriorated. Entire battalions are repeatedly refusing to obey orders from headquarters. In addition to self-inflicted injuries or feigning illness to avoid combat, criticism of the U.S. command has increased, and desertions have also increased. MacArthur reported that recently arrived troops in Korea have been "infected with sympathy" for the Korean democrats, and anti-American sentiment is very evident. MacArthur's report also suggests taking "appropriate measures" to conduct so-called "ideological education" for the accomplice troops.

　　美帝利用其他国家军队当炮灰
    侵朝军队内部火并
    麦克阿瑟图清洗士气低落的部队
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社海牙二十七日电：真理报发表一篇该报驻伦敦记者关于美英侵略军之间近来发生的事件的报道。记者写道：英国国防部的人士已经知道，麦克阿瑟曾命令美国第八军军长李奇微将军和第十兵团司令阿尔梦德不要使用在前线上的美军掩护退却，而要利用其他国家的部队来担任这种任务。美国参谋官员常常命令其他国家的部队据守形势非常不利的防地，结果，这些部队几乎都是全军覆没。美国军队对掩护美军撤退的军队，从来不给予支持。
    记者并报道了侵略军阵营内部所发生的严重事件。美军借口用大炮支持那些担任掩护任务的帮凶部队，实际上却是有意地用炮火切断了这些部队的退路。被激怒了的英国和其他国家的部队，时常射击装运美军逃向后方的卡车。真理报记者报道说：在朝鲜的英国侵略军司令官已将所发生的这些情况报告了英国国防部长辛威尔。
    【新华社二十八日讯】被侵朝美军当局当作炮灰的各帮凶国家的部队中弥漫厌战和反美情绪。麦克阿瑟正力图加以清洗。据电通社华盛顿二十六日讯：麦克阿瑟已提议清洗参加侵朝战争的非美国军队中的“散布恐慌”的分子。麦克阿瑟在给杜鲁门的特别报告中说：必须与有关的各国政府商讨部分地或全部地撤换那些开小差、不服从命令等现象达到极点的那些部队。电通社称，美国特务机关已在调查参加“朝鲜联合国部队”的非美军部队的士气与战斗价值。美国特务所进行的这些调查透露，在最近一个时期，朝鲜前线的英国、加拿大、澳大利亚及其他帮凶军队的士兵的士气，甚至一部分军官的士气，都更为衰退。整营整营的拒绝服从司令部命令的事情，层出不穷。除了自己弄伤自己、或是假装患病以便规避作战的事情之外，对美国司令部的批评已经增多，开小差的事件也增多了。麦克阿瑟报告说：最近到达朝鲜的部队对朝鲜民主分子“感染了同情心”，反美情绪非常明显。麦克阿瑟的报告并建议采取“适当措施”，对帮凶部队进行所谓“思想教育”。
