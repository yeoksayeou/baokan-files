　　Great Unity of All Ethnic Groups
    Editor's Note: The representative conference of all ethnic groups in Lijiang Prefecture, Yunnan Province, was held in mid-October. A total of 364 representatives and attendees from 25 ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Lisu, Yi, Mosuo, and Bai people from 13 counties, participated in the conference. During the conference, representatives of all ethnic groups spoke enthusiastically and discussed the issue of unity among all ethnic groups. After the discussions at this conference, as the Tibetan Jifu from Deqin Administrative Bureau said: "We deeply understand that the disunity and mutual fighting among ethnic groups in the past were caused by the provocations of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, all ethnic groups must unite as eternally flowing as the Jinsha River and as solid as the Himalayas." Therefore, everyone more clearly recognized that their common enemies are American imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries, and unanimously expressed that they will strengthen unity in the future, build a big family of love and cooperation among all ethnic groups under the leadership of Chairman Mao, overthrow the two ideological enemies of great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and fight to the end to completely eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

　　各兄弟民族大团结
    编者按：云南省丽江专区各民族代表会议于十月中旬召开，参加这次会议的有十三个县的藏族、傈僳、彝族、摩些、民家等二十五种民族的代表及列席者共三百六十四人。在会议进行的当中，各族代表热烈发言，讨论各兄弟民族的团结问题。经过了这次会议的讨论，正如德钦设治局藏族吉福说的：“我们深刻地知道了过去各兄弟民族的不团结、互相打杀是受了国民党反动派的挑拨，今后在毛主席的领导下，各兄弟民族要团结得象金沙江的水一样永流，像喜马拉雅山一样坚固。”因而大家更清楚地认识了自己共同的敌人是美帝国主义者和国民党反动派，并一致表示今后要加强团结，在毛主席的领导下，建设各民族友爱合作的大家庭，打倒大民族主义和狭隘的民族主义两个思想敌人，为彻底消灭蒋介石残余匪帮而奋斗到底。
