Xinhua News Agency, Yong'an, January 19th: "Voice of Vietnam" radio station's special correspondent reported on the 16th on the People's Army of Vietnam's recent annihilation of three battalions of French reinforcement troops 50 kilometers northwest of Hanoi. The report stated: On the morning of January 14th, when the People's Army of Vietnam had completely removed the French stronghold of Bao Truc, located 15 kilometers northwest of Yong'an and 50 kilometers northwest of Hanoi, the French army sent reinforcements north from Yong'an. The enemy reinforcements were the French Third Mobile Group led by Lieutenant Colonel Farnasie. They advanced in three groups. The first group was the Third Battalion of the Second Moroccan Infantry Regiment, advancing in the direction of Yong'an and Tam Dao. The second group was a mercenary battalion, advancing along the mountain road. The third group was an infantry battalion, crossing the Man River, with the destination being the Dao Tu and Bao Truc areas. The first group was intercepted by the People's Army three kilometers north of Yong'an. The People's Army killed a large number of enemy troops and pursued the remaining enemy troops all the way to the vicinity of the Yong'an provincial capital. The second and third groups were surrounded by the People's Army of Vietnam in Dao Tu, and the enemy's morale quickly collapsed. After being relentlessly pursued and fiercely attacked, a large number of mercenaries surrendered to the People's Army. While the People's Army was engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy, French aircraft took off in batches throughout the day, but to no avail, as most of their bombs fell behind the battle line or on their own French positions. Similarly, the enemy's artillery fired aimlessly, with most of the shells landing in rice paddies and open fields. From 2:00 p.m. onwards, the battle was almost like hunting, with batches of demoralized enemy troops being captured. Before dusk, all the remaining enemy troops had laid down their weapons.
    In this large-scale mobile war, fighting took place throughout the day of January 14th on a front spanning 15 kilometers in length and 10 kilometers in width, stretching from the Yong'an provincial capital to Bao Truc northwest of Yong'an, and from Xunlong to the Man River. The Third Mobile Group commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Farnasie was almost completely annihilated by the People's Army. Only one company escaped back to Yong'an. Approximately one thousand enemy troops were captured. The People's Army also seized a large quantity of weapons and equipment.

　　在越北攻势中
    越人民军歼法军经过
    【新华社十九日讯】越南通讯社永安讯：“越南之声”电台特派记者十六日报道越南人民军部队最近在河内西北五十余公里处，歼灭法军增援部队三个营经过称：一月十四日清晨，当越南人民军部队已完全拔除了永安西北十五公里、河内西北五十余公里处的法军据点保烛时，法军由永安北上增援。敌方援军是由范纳西姆中校率领的法国第三机动部队。他们分三股北上。第一股是摩洛哥步兵第二团的第三营，顺着永安、三岛的方向前进。第二股是某一营雇佣兵，由山路前进。第三股是一个步兵营，越过曼河前进，目的地是道聚、保烛地区。第一股在永安以北三公里处被人民军截击，人民军击毙大量敌军，并将残余敌军一直追到永安省会附近。第二股与第三股在道聚被越南人民军部队包围，敌军士气迅速崩溃。大批雇佣兵被穷追和猛攻后，都向人民军投降。当人民军与敌军进行激战时，法军飞机整天不断地分批出动，但是没有什么效果，因为他们的炸弹大部都落在战线后面，或在法军自己的阵地上。同样，敌军的大炮也是毫无目标地发射，炮弹大部都落到稻田里和空地上。从下午二时起，战斗几乎就像打猎一样，失去斗志的敌军一批一批地被俘。不到黄昏时分，所有的残余敌军都已放下武器。
    在这次大规模的机动战争中，从永安省会到永安西北的保烛以及从浔隆到曼河这一长达十五公里宽达十公里的战线上，一月十四日的整天中都有战斗。范纳西姆中校所统率的第三机动部队，几乎被人民军全歼，只有一个连逃回永安，敌军被俘计约一千人。人民军并缴获大量武器和装备。
