Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 12th. The Central South China Volunteer Medical Surgical Team, consisting of 94 members, departed from Wuhan on the 10th to work on the Korean front.

After the meeting, a demonstration march against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea was held. The march was led by the Central South China Volunteer Medical Surgical Team. Teams of "white-clad warriors" advanced proudly in the snow. Thousands of five-star red flags fluttered under the clear sunshine, appearing even more bright and magnificent. Countless pedestrians cheered along the streets, and many shops set off firecrackers. The members of the medical surgical team boarded the northbound train amidst the thunderous applause of those sending them off.
