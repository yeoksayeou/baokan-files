　　Young Workers in the Fifth District of Wuhan Resolutely Respond to the Call of the Motherland

Dear Chairman Mao:

　　We are a group of your loyal good sons and daughters. Just as we were starting to live good lives under your leadership, just as we were tasting the free and happy life, the American imperialists were not reconciled. Thinking that their weapons were good, their airplanes and cannons were numerous, they shamelessly stretched out their claws to be enemies with us working people, using their superior weapons to attack our neighbors, bombing our borders with airplanes, strafing our merchant ships, and occupying our Taiwan. It made our hearts want to explode. We resolutely went to the place where the motherland needs us most, responding to your call to join the military cadre school. Some of us are car drivers, some are car repairmen and mechanic apprentices. We ask to be tank soldiers, air force, navy, to defend our airspace, our territorial waters, to defend our beautiful homeland and our happy lives. We swear to you that we will never disgrace you, we will definitely be your good sons and daughters.
                                 Young Workers and Communist Youth League Members of the Fifth District of Wuhan

　　武汉市第五区青年工人坚决响应祖国的号召亲爱的毛主席：
    我们是您的一群忠实的好儿女，当我们在您领导下刚开始过着好的日子，刚尝到自由幸福的生活，美帝死不甘心，以为他的武器好，飞机大炮多，无耻的伸出他的魔掌和我们劳动人民为敌，挟他优势武器向我们邻居进攻，用飞机轰炸我们的边境，扫射我们的商船，侵占我们的台湾，气得我们的心都要炸了，我们坚决地走到祖国最需要我们的地方去，响应您的号召，参加军事干部学校。我们中间有的是汽车司机，有的是汽车修理工和机工学徒，我们要求做一个坦克手、空军、海军，为了保卫我们的领空、领海，保卫我们美丽的国土和我们幸福的生活而战斗。我们向您宣誓，我们决不丢人，我们一定做您的好儿女。
                                 武汉市第五区青年工人、青年团员
