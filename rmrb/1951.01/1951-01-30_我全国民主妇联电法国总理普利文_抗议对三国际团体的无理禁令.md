　　All-China Women's Democratic Federation Cables French Premier Pleven
　　Protesting Unreasonable Ban on Three International Organizations
　　[Our Newspaper News] The All-China Women's Democratic Federation sent a telegram to French Premier Pleven on the 29th, protesting the French government's reactionary measures of unreasonably prohibiting the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the three major international democratic organizations, on French territory. The text of the telegram is as follows: Mr. French Premier Pleven:
　　Women all over China express surprise and indignation upon learning that the French government has openly adopted fascist means and unreasonably issued an order announcing the prohibition of the three most prestigious mass organizations in the world—the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth—from operating within French territory. The Women's International Democratic Federation has more than 91 million members and powerfully leads women all over the world in their heroic struggle to defend world peace; it is a united organization of women all over the world for defending peace and safeguarding the rights and interests of women and children. The French government has no reason or right to take any persecutory measures against it. Women all over China will, together with women all over France and women all over the world, fight to win the freedom and legal status of the Women's International Democratic Federation headquarters to continue its existence in France, and hereby lodge a serious protest with the French government and firmly demand that the French government immediately revoke this order.
　　[Our Newspaper News] The French government's reactionary measures of unreasonably prohibiting the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth in France have aroused the anger of the broad masses of people in our country. The protest statement from the Youth League Committee of the Renmin University of China stated, "This fascist and tyrannical act of the reactionary French government once again blatantly demonstrates that the reactionary French government is a base servant carrying out the orders of US imperialism." The Student Union of Beijing Normal University issued a statement demanding that the French government immediately revoke this unreasonable ban, the statement pointed out: "All these arrogant attempts and actions will undoubtedly meet with shameful failure, and the people of the world will unite even more closely and strongly because of this!"

　　我全国民主妇联电法国总理普利文
　  抗议对三国际团体的无理禁令
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会二十九日致电法国总理普利文，抗议法国政府无理禁止世界工联、世界民主妇联及世界民主青联三大国际民主团体在法国领土活动的反动措施。电文如下：法国总理普利文先生：
    全中国妇女获悉法国政府公然采取法西斯手段，无理发布命令，宣布禁止全世界最有威望的三个群众团体——世界工会联合会，国际民主妇女联合会，世界民主青年联盟在法国境内活动的反动措施，表示惊异与愤慨。国际民主妇联拥有九千一百余万会员，有力地领导了全世界妇女为保卫世界和平而英勇奋斗；它是全世界妇女保卫和平和维护妇女儿童权益的联合组织。法国政府无理也无权对它采取任何迫害的措施。全中国妇女将与全法国妇女以及全世界妇女一道，为争取国际民主妇联总部在法国的继续存在的自由及合法地位而斗争，并在此向法国政府提出严重抗议，坚决要求法国政府速即撤销是项命令。
    【本报讯】法国政府无理禁止世界工联、国际民主妇联及世界民主青联在法国境内活动的反动措施，激起了我国广大人民的愤怒。中国人民大学青年团团委会的抗议声明中称，“法国反动政府这一法西斯的专横暴力行为，再度露骨地表明了法国反动政府是卑鄙地奉行着美帝国主义命令的仆从。”北京师范大学学生会发表声明，要求法国政府立即撤销这一无理禁令，声明指出：“所有这些狂妄的企图和行为，无疑的又要遭到可耻的失败，全世界人民将因此团结得更紧密、更坚强！”
