　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The China Association for Promoting Democracy recently issued a statement endorsing the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government's order regarding the control and investigation of American property in China and the freezing of American public and private deposits in China, as well as the "Decision on Handling Cultural and Educational, Relief Organizations, and Religious Groups Receiving American Subsidies." The statement noted: Recently, the American government brazenly announced the control of the assets of the Chinese people in the United States and attempted to threaten the livelihoods of personnel in all schools, hospitals, and other organizations receiving American subsidies by halting the payment of subsidies. This is another crime of American imperialism in its hostility towards the Chinese people. The decision of our Central People's Government's Government Administration Council regarding the control and investigation of American property within our country, as well as the handling of all cultural and educational, relief organizations, and religious groups receiving American subsidies, is a powerful counterattack by the Chinese people against the destructive schemes of American imperialism. This Association resolutely supports this wise measure and calls on all members and the people of the whole country to fight together under the leadership of the People's Government to finally, permanently, and thoroughly eliminate the cultural and economic aggression forces of American imperialism in our country. We firmly believe that the Chinese people will be able to accomplish this glorious task.

    【新华社八日讯】中国民主促进会顷发表声明，拥护中央人民政府政务院关于管制清查美国在中国的财产和冻结美国在中国的公私存款的命令和“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定”。声明略称：最近美国政府悍然宣布管制中国人民在美的资产，并妄图以停发补助费的办法来威胁所有接受美国津贴的学校、医院等机关中的人员的生活。这是美帝国主义敌视中国人民的又一罪行。我中央人民政府政务院关于管制和清查美国在我国境内的财产，以及关于处理所有受美国津贴的文教、救济机关与宗教团体的决定，是中国人民对美帝国主义破坏阴谋有力的回击。本会坚决拥护这项英明措施，并号召全体会员与全国人民一起，在人民政府领导之下，为最后地、永远地、彻底地肃清美帝国主义在我国的文化侵略和经济侵略势力而斗争。我们坚决相信：中国人民必能完成这项光荣的任务。
