　　Local Newspapers Launch Worker-Peasant Correspondent Movement
　　After the "Worker's Daily" in Beijing was revamped, it adopted a method of facing the whole country and developing gradually in its correspondence work. After ten months of effort, it now has more than 3,000 correspondents across the country, distributed in major administrative regions. Except for Qinghai, all other provinces, cities, and industrial and mining areas have established contact. The "Worker's Daily" has been able to achieve such results because the editorial board emphasized strengthening the work of correspondents, and the interviewing department focused on liaison work as a regular priority, unified leadership, and implemented internal and external development. Within the interviewing department, Central, Beijing, and major administrative region groups were established to specialize in this work. In Central and Beijing, a combination of interviewing and liaison was implemented. Outside of Beijing, interview groups were dispatched to cities such as Shenyang, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Taiyuan to work on a permanent basis. Each group focused on liaison, with dedicated personnel responsible. Organic coordination between internal and external efforts has yielded great results.
　　In October of last year, the "Northeast Daily" hired 82 representatives from the Northeast region who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers as worker-peasant correspondents. Some of them soon wrote articles. This is a group of worker-peasant correspondents of the best quality, and the Northeast Daily paid special attention to them, maintained close contact with them, and relied on them as the backbone of worker-peasant correspondent work, thereby strengthening worker-peasant correspondent work. In September, many regions held conferences to elect labor models and combat heroes. Many newspapers hired these heroes and models as correspondents, and achieved great success.
　　After the Northeast Local Party Newspaper Conference in November, the "New Fushun Daily" decided to vigorously develop worker correspondent work. Half of the editorial staff was drawn out, led by the deputy editor-in-chief to carry out the work. Currently, worker correspondents account for more than 61% of all correspondents in the city. The main shortcoming discovered in the work, and currently being overcome, is the relaxation of political and ideological education and leadership for correspondents, failing to make them correctly recognize that worker correspondents are representatives and communicators of public opinion, but simply organizing them to write articles. This shortcoming has hindered the correspondent work to a certain extent.
　　The "Worker's Life Daily" in Wuxi improved its correspondence work by first addressing the idea that reporters should do a good job in correspondence work. It emphasized at various meetings that correspondence work is the main task of reporters, thus reversing the trend that reporters unfamiliar with production reported on production, while the vast number of correspondents familiar with production technology did not report on production. As a result, the number of articles reporting on production increased daily, and the quality of these articles improved significantly, helping to implement the policy that "newspapers should use the primary space to report on the labor and production of the people," and also consolidating the confidence of reporters in doing a good job in correspondence work.
　　The "Dazhong Daily" in Jinan examined its correspondence work during the rectification movement at the end of November 1950. One of the gains was solving the so-called problem of "easy to develop, difficult to consolidate." It was found that there were shortcomings in developing correspondents. For example, some were hired as correspondents based only on the writing skills of occasional submissions, some were only determined by organizing a list of names, and some who only wanted to write articles and become famous were also hired as correspondents. In terms of training and education, there was also a lack of attention to helping them progress politically, making them understand the political tasks of worker correspondents, and cultivating their sense of being "social activists," with improvement in writing skills coming second. It was precisely because of this lack of clarity in the target of development and the failure to grasp the key points of training and education that the phenomenon of "easy to develop, difficult to consolidate" occurred.
　　The "Southern Daily" proposed in early October 1950 that one of the central tasks for the fourth quarter was to "strive to establish a universal urban and rural correspondence network." As of the end of November, the results in the enterprise sector were relatively good. All public and private factories and trade unions in Guangzhou had correspondents, of which 65% had established correspondence groups, but the results in rural areas, urban schools, and institutions were not significant. Rectifying the organization of the rural correspondence network was difficult due to insufficient manpower. The key to solving this difficulty will lie in equipping local reporters and using their main force to carry out correspondence work.
　　Since November of last year, the work of the "Chahar Daily" correspondence stations and county correspondence officers has undergone a new transformation, implementing a combination of correspondence and newspaper reading work, overcoming the past working methods of only being active in institutions and delving into administrative affairs. Instead, two-thirds of the force was used to go deep into rural areas to organize newspaper reading work. As a result, not only did the masses read the newspapers and publicize the policies, but they were also able to write letters and articles to the newspaper and reflect the work in the village. It is inappropriate for correspondents to use their main force on newspaper reading work, but the transformation in the work of the Chahar Daily correspondence station does illustrate the shortcomings of relying on institutional correspondence organizations, and it can only be corrected in the transformation of going deep into the masses.

### 各地报纸开展工农通讯员运动

专栏：

　　各地报纸开展工农通讯员运动
    北京“工人日报”改版以后，在通讯工作上实行了面向全国、逐步发展的办法，经过十个月的努力，现在全国已有通讯员三千多人，分布在全国各大行政区。除青海以外，其他各省市及工矿地区都已有了联系。“工人日报”能够获得这样的成果是由于编委会强调加强通讯员工作，采访部以通联工作为经常重点，统一领导，实行内外发展的原故。采访部内部，分中央、北京市及各大行政区等小组，专门负责进行，在中央及北京并实行采通合一。在北京以外，如沈阳天津上海太原等市，则派出采访小组，常驻工作，各组均以通联为主，由专人负责进行。内外实行有机配合，收到了很大的实效。
    “东北日报”去年十月份聘请了东北区出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的八十二名代表为工农通讯员，有的不久便写了稿子。这是一批质量最好的工农通讯员，东北日报对他们特别加以重视，与他们密切联系，依靠他们作为工农通讯员的骨干，从而加强工农通讯员工作。九月间许多地区举行了选举劳动模范战斗英雄的大会，许多报纸聘请这些英雄模范做通讯员，都获得了很大的成绩。
    “新抚顺报”十一月份在东北地方党报会议之后，决定大力开展工人通讯员工作，编辑部抽出一半人力，由副总编辑领导进行工作，现全市通讯员中，工人通讯员占百分之六十一强。工作中发现了并正在克服中的主要缺点是放松对通讯员的政策思想的教育和领导，没有使他们正确地认识到工人通讯员是舆论的代表者和传达者，而是单纯的组织写稿，这个缺点曾使通讯工作受到了一定的阻碍。
    无锡“工人生活报”改进通讯工作，首先从打通记者做好通讯工作的思想着手，在各种会议上强调通讯工作是记者的主要任务；因此转变了这样一个趋势，即不熟悉生产的记者报道生产，而熟悉生产技术的广大通讯员却不报道生产的现象。结果，报道生产的稿件逐日增加，并使这方面稿件的质量有显著的提高，帮助贯彻了“报纸应该用首要篇幅来报道人民劳动生产状况”的方针，也巩固了记者做好通讯员工作的信心。
    济南“大众日报”在一九五○年十一月底的整风运动中检查了通讯工作，收获之一是解决了所谓“发展容易巩固难”的问题。发现在发展通讯员中有做得不好的地方，如有的仅仅根据偶然来稿的写作技术而被聘为通讯员，有的仅通过组织确定一批名单，有仅为了想写写文章出出名的人也被聘为通讯员。在培养教育上又没有注意主要应该是帮助他们在政治上进步，使他们了解工人通讯员的政治任务，培养他们的“社会事业家”的感觉，其次才是写作技术上的提高。正是由于这种发展对象不明确，培养教育工作不得要领的缺点，才发生了“发展容易巩固难”的现象。
    “南方日报”在一九五○年十月初提出第四季的中心工作之一是“为普遍建立城乡通讯网而奋斗”。至十一月底止，在企业部门中结果比较好，广州市各公私营工厂及工会都有了通讯员，其中百分之六十五已成立了通讯组，但在农村、城市的学校和机关中成绩不大。整顿农村通讯网的组织，由于人力不够，做起来很困难，解决这个困难的关键将在于配备地方记者，并以主要力量去进行通讯工作。
    “察哈尔日报”从去年十一月开始，各通讯站和县通讯干事的工作有了新的转变，实行通讯与读报工作的结合，克服了过去单在机关中活动，钻进事务圈子的工作方法，转而用三分之二的力量深入农村组织读报工作，结果不仅给群众读了报，宣传了政策，而且还能给报社写信，写稿件、反映村里的工作。通讯员把主要力量用在读报工作上是不适当的，但察哈尔日报通讯站工作上的转变，确说明了依靠机关的通讯组织的缺点，只有在深入群众的转变中才能得到纠正。
