　　Defend Our Beautiful Orchard!
    ——A Letter to Chairman Mao from Lin Shishan, Orchard Demonstration Farmer of Shanhoucun Village, Lüda

Respected Chairman Mao:

We farmers in the Lüda area have truly had a double blessing: we received land, and we also had a great harvest. Today I am telling you about this happy event. I was a long-term hired laborer for twenty-four years, but today, under your leadership, I have straightened my back, have a house and land, and have become a master of the country!

Chairman Mao: This year, my orchard, thanks to the careful care and help of the People's Government, plus my own efforts, created a method of using "mercuric chloride solution" and "Bordeaux mixture" to eliminate canker disease, basically curing fruit tree canker. Therefore, this year I had an unprecedented bumper harvest. Two hundred and forty fruit trees produced more than 20,000 jin of apples, 13,000 jin more than when they were in the hands of the landlord. These apples are worth forty-five shi of corn. After paying the public grain and deducting costs, not only is my food and clothing abundant, but I also have money to buy livestock and agricultural implements. Now my family has a large mule, a large cart, and is also raising five large, fat pigs! This was something I never dreamed of in the past!

Chairman Mao: I'm telling you, I have now been promoted to the life of a middle peasant! Where did this kind of life come from? Everyone knows that this is all because of you and the government under your leadership.

However, just as our prosperous days are rising day by day, the old hand at slaughtering the Chinese people—American imperialism—has stretched out its invading bloody hand towards our motherland, our hometown. It wants us to live the life of beasts of burden again, it wants to steal our prosperous days. Chairman Mao: The Chinese people under your leadership are not afraid of them at all. We are determined, and we have already risen up to fight them. We who have turned ourselves over know how good days are obtained. Today, in order to defend our happy life, defend our beautiful motherland and my orchard, I have sent my son, who married his wife only last February, to join the Volunteer Army. In addition, not only have I already dried and cleaned the 1,148 jin of public grain that I should hand in, but I have also contributed 200 jin of grain. But this is not enough. I know that eliminating American robbers requires everyone to take action, so I will work harder in the rear. I plan to produce 25,000 jin of good apples next year. In order to effectively realize this plan, I will do the following: (1) Increase fertilizer. Next year, each tree will be fed an average of ten jin of soybean cake, two dan of manure, two and a half jin of bone meal, and one bucket of manure water, which is three jin more soybean cake and two and a half jin of bone meal than this year. (2) In addition to spraying eight applications of pesticide in a timely manner and continuing to use "mercuric chloride solution" and "Bordeaux mixture" to completely eradicate fruit tree canker, I will also study grafting techniques next year, organize technical research classes, and organize all orchard households in the village to graft in order to exchange grafting experience and improve apple yield and quality.

Finally, I wish Chairman Mao eternal health!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Lin Shishan, Orchard Demonstration Farmer of Shanhoucun Village, Lüda City

　　保卫我们的美丽的果园！
    ——旅大山后村果园示范农户   林士善给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我们旅大地区的农民真是双喜进门：我们分了地，又得了大丰收。今天我把这个喜事告诉给您。我是个扛了二十四年大活的人，今天在您的领导下，也挺起了腰板，有了房子有了地，当了国家的主人！
    毛主席：今年我的果园，由于人民政府的细心照顾和帮助，再加上我自己努力，创造出用“升汞水”和“波尔多液”消灭腐烂病的办法，基本上治好了果树腐烂病，所以今年便得到空前的大丰收。二百四十棵果树，结了二万多斤苹果，比在地主手里多结一万三千斤。这些苹果能顶四十五石苞米。除了交公粮，扣除成本外，不但吃穿富富裕裕的，而且还有余钱买牲口置农具。现在我家里有一头大骡子，有一辆大车，还喂上五口大肥猪呢！这在过去作梦也想不到啊！
    毛主席：我告诉您，现在俺已经升到中农的生活了！这样的生活是那里来的？大家都知道，这都是因为有了您和您领导下的政府。
    可是，正当着我们的红火日月天天上升的时候，屠杀中国人民的老手——美帝国主义又向我们祖国，我们的家乡伸出了侵略血手，他要我们再过牛马的生活，它要抢走我们的红火日月。毛主席：在您领导下的中国人民，决不怕它们，我们一定，现在已经起来和他们干。我们翻过身的人知道好日子是怎样得来的。今天为了保卫我们的幸福生活，保卫我们美好的祖国和我的果树园，我已把我去年二月才娶了媳妇的儿子，送去参加志愿军。另外，不但将我应交的一千一百四十八斤公粮晒干扬净早已交上，我还献了二百斤粮食。但这些还不够，我知道消灭美国强盗要大家都动手，所以我还要在后方更加努力生产。我计划来年一定生产好苹果二万五千斤。为了切实实现这个计划，我要做到：（１）增加肥料，来年一棵树平均喂十斤豆饼，两担大粪，二斤半骨粉，一桶大粪水，较今年增加三斤豆饼，二斤半骨粉。（２）除了适时喷上八遍药水和继续使用“升汞水”、“波尔多液”彻底根除果树腐烂病外，来年还要研究接枝术，组织技术研究班，将全村果园户组织起来接枝，以交流接枝经验，提高苹果产量、质量。最后我祝毛主席永远健康！
