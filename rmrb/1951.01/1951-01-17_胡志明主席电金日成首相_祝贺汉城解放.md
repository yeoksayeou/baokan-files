　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh Cables Premier Kim Il-sung
    Congratulating the Liberation of Seoul
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 16th] Vietnam News Agency reports: On January 12th, Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a cable to Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, congratulating the liberation of Seoul. The cable reads as follows:
    On the joyous occasion of the recovery of Seoul, I, on behalf of the government, army, and entire people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, extend our heartfelt congratulations to the government, army, and people of your country, as well as to the glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The great victory of the Korean people clearly points out to the imperialist bloc: when a nation is united and stands strong to fight for independence, that nation will surely triumph, and no number of imperialists can prevent this victory.
    The great victory of the Korean people has encouraged the nations of Asia, especially the Vietnamese nation, which is working hard to resist the aggression of French colonialism and the interference of American imperialism, and striving for genuine independence and unification. I extend my fraternal greetings to you, the Korean people, and the army!
                                                Ho Chi Minh (signed)
