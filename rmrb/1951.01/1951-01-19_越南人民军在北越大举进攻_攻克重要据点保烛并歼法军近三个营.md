Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 16th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Vietnamese People's Army units are currently launching a large-scale offensive against French forces in the Red River Delta region of North Vietnam, and have annihilated nearly three French battalions 50 kilometers northwest of Hanoi. A spokesman for the Vietnamese People's Army Headquarters stated at a press conference on the 15th that after 12 hours of intense fighting, the Vietnamese People's Army completely captured the important French stronghold of Bao Truc, 15 kilometers north of Vinh Yen, on the 14th, killing and capturing 200 French soldiers, capturing the French commander of the stronghold, and seizing a large amount of military supplies. Bao Truc was a heavily fortified French stronghold, controlling all transportation lines in central North Vietnam and guarding the French-occupied provincial capital of Vinh Yen.

Another unit of the People's Army simultaneously intercepted and surrounded the French 3rd Mobile Group, which had come from Vinh Yen to reinforce Bao Truc. The battle ended on the evening of the 14th. All three battalions of French reinforcements were annihilated by the People's Army, except for one company that escaped south. The People's Army pursued the escaping French troops to the vicinity of Vinh Yen. On the evening of the 13th, People's Army units also eliminated three French strongholds in the Xun Long and Qu Liao areas northwest of Vinh Yen.
