Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 9th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly resumed discussion on January 8th of the unreasonable slander case proposed by the United States, the so-called "Chinese Communist intervention in Korea." The first to speak was the Kuomintang element Jiang Tingfu, who demanded the condemnation of the government of the People's Republic of China.

The British representative, Jebb, said: "All glorious solutions must be explored." He admitted that, in essence, these "glorious solutions" were unacceptable to the government of the People's Republic of China. However, he threateningly hinted that "action may have to be taken," which might create "a real split between China and other United Nations countries." He went on to say that this could be fraught with dangerous consequences. Therefore, it would be best not to hastily conclude that a solution was impossible, and it would be best to consider it for some time before making a decision. Jebb stated that Israel's proposals for the new draft resolution being prepared by the so-called Armistice Committee were worthy of support because they were the best way to maintain the unity of the United Nations. Jebb finally suggested that the Political Committee adjourn until January 11 to make a decision.

Next to speak was the Soviet representative, Malik, who gave a broad review of the history of the American aggression in Korea and China. He attacked the Israeli representative's proposal for a ceasefire first and resolution later, exposing British representative Jebb's unreasonable attack, saying that China was "brandishing its power before the United Nations." Malik pointed out that now is the time for the United Nations to stop mistreating China. In conclusion, Malik urged the passage of the Soviet proposal, namely the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, allowing the Korean people to solve the Korean problem themselves.

The Australian representative, Shawn, supported the British motion to adjourn until January 11.

The Soviet representative, Malik, opposed the adjournment. He insisted that the Political Committee should continue with the other items on the agenda. Polish representative Katz-Suchy supported Malik's proposal. However, the US-British bloc started up the voting machine and decided to adjourn until January 11 by a vote of forty-four to five, with seven abstentions.

　　联大政委会八日会议
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社纽约九日讯：联合国大会政治委员会一月八日恢复讨论美国提出的所谓“中华人民共和国干涉朝鲜”的无理毁谤案。第一个发言的是国民党分子蒋廷黻，他要求谴责中华人民共和国政府。
    英国代表杰伯说：必须探求“一切光荣的解决办法”。他承认，从本质上来说，这些“光荣的办法”都是中华人民共和国政府所不能接受的，然而他却威胁地暗示说，“也许必须采取行动”，这样结局便可能造成“中国和其他联合国国家之间的真正分裂”。他接着说，这样可能充满危险的后果，因此，最好不要贸然断定已经无法获得解决，最好是先考虑一些时候再作决定。杰伯表示，以色列对所谓停战委员会正在准备中的新建议案所提出的建议，是值得支持的，因为那是保持联合国团结的最好办法。杰伯最后建议，政委会休会至一月十一日再作出决定。
    接着发言的是苏联代表马立克，他广泛地回顾了美国侵略朝鲜和中国的历史。他抨击以色列代表所提出的先停战后解决的建议，揭露英国代表杰伯的无理攻击，杰伯说中国“向联合国耀武扬威”。马立克指出，现在是联合国停止错误对待中国的时候了。马立克结语中促请通过苏联的提案，即外国军队立即撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题。
    澳大利亚代表尚恩支持英国的要求休会到一月十一日的动议。
    苏联代表马立克反对休会，他坚持政委会应继续进行议程上的其他项目。波兰代表卡茨——苏琪支持马立克的主张。但是美英集团开动了表决机器，以四十四对五票、七票弃权决定休会到一月十一日再开。
