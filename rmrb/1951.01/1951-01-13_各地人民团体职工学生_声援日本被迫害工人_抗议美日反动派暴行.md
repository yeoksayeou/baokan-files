　　People's Organizations, Workers, and Students in Various Locations
    Voice Support for Persecuted Japanese Workers
    Protest Atrocities by the US-Japan Reactionaries
    [This newspaper reports] People's organizations, workers, and youth students in various locations are furiously protesting the illegal verdict by the US-Japan reactionaries on the so-called "Matsukawa Incident," demanding the reversal of the original sentence and the immediate release of those arrested, and expressing their full support for the just struggle of the Japanese working class and patriotic people. The statement from the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions states: "We want to warn the reactionary Japanese government: the forces of people's democracy and national liberation movements can never be conquered. No matter how brutal and vicious you are today, the path taken by Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee awaits you." The protest letter from the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions states: "We, representing the 400,000 workers of Tianjin, strongly protest to the Japanese government, resolutely oppose this atrocity, and demand the immediate and unconditional release of those arrested." The protest letter from the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions states: "The working class and peace-loving people of the world must stand up and oppose the towering crimes of US imperialism in Japan, and extend a helping hand to the twenty persecuted Japanese brothers." The statement from the Northwest Regional Federation of Trade Unions states that they will resolutely support the twenty arrested Japanese patriotic workers. In addition, people's organizations such as the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Chahar Provincial Democratic Youth Federation, the Chahar Provincial Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Central-South Federation of Trade Unions, the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Central-South Democratic Women's Federation, and the Central-South Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League have also issued statements or circulars expressing their protests.
    After hearing the news that the US-Japan reactionaries were persecuting Japanese workers, railway workers in Tianjin, Shenyang, Zhangjiakou and other places unanimously protested furiously. Railway trade unions in various places have issued protest letters and expressed support and condolences to the persecuted workers. Workers in various units in the Tianjin area have held discussions, believing that this is not an accidental occurrence, but a major conspiracy by the reactionary Yoshida government under the instigation of US imperialism to persecute the Japanese working class. In the protest letter issued by all the workers of the Beijing Power Station of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration, in addition to demanding the release of Shin Suzuki and others, they warned the reactionary Japanese government to immediately stop its attempts to separately negotiate peace with the US and its actions of following the US in expanding its war of aggression. Du Kuishan, a labor hero in Shenyang, and Cao Chunlin, a foreman at the Shenyang Locomotive Depot, both indignantly stated: We must resolutely oppose this atrocity; and we believe that the struggle of the Japanese patriotic workers will surely be victorious. All the workers of the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot wrote a letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, stating that they would immediately publicize and expose the conspiracy and atrocities of the US-Japan reactionaries.
    All the students of Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing, as well as the trade union of the Beijing Railway Institute of Northern Jiaotong University, and the trade union of Beijing No. 1 Middle School, expressed great anger at the persecution of Japanese workers by the US-Japan reactionaries. All the students of Peking University issued a protest letter stating: We resolutely protest the Japanese government's persecution of Japanese patriotic workers under the pretext of the "Matsukawa Incident." We warmly support the Japanese Communist Party's appeal to the peace-loving people of the world, demanding the immediate and unconditional release of all those arrested. All the students of Tsinghua University wrote a letter to the All-China Students' Federation on the 11th, reporting that all the students of Tsinghua University cannot tolerate the atrocities of the US-Japan reactionaries in suppressing the Japanese patriotic people; and suggested that the All-China Students' Federation represent all Chinese students in supporting the Japanese Communist Party's appeal and fully supporting the Japanese patriotic people. The trade union of the Beijing Railway Institute of Northern Jiaotong University issued a protest letter on the 11th, and all the teachers and staff of the union solemnly signed a protest the next day. The protest letter stated: US imperialism is undoubtedly the common enemy of the people of China and Japan. The Chinese working class cannot sit idly by while the Japanese working class is being persecuted, and must work together to eliminate this fierce and brutal enemy. All members of the Beijing No. 1 Middle School Trade Union stated: We resolutely oppose the barbaric and shameful behavior of the US-Japan fascists in trying to drive the Japanese people to be cannon fodder for aggression. Li Yuzhuang and others from Class One of the Research Institute of the North China People's Revolutionary University also wrote to this newspaper, expressing their extreme indignation at the atrocities of the US-Japan reactionaries.
