The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
    Supplementary Instructions on Handling Unemployed Intellectuals

    I. In the past six months, due to the initial improvement of the national financial and economic situation and the gradual recovery of various construction undertakings, and also due to the instructions on relieving unemployed workers, the instructions on relieving unemployed teachers and handling the problem of student dropout issued successively by this Council, and the Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers approved by this Council having been implemented in various places, a portion of the large number of unemployed intellectuals created by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past have already been employed or have received material relief. However, the issue of handling other unemployed intellectuals besides those stipulated in the aforementioned instructions and measures should also be appropriately resolved. In order to actively increase the opportunities and conditions for various unemployed intellectuals to find employment and to gradually assist them in finding employment, the following supplementary instructions are hereby issued, and it is hoped that people's governments at all levels and relevant competent departments will earnestly implement them.

    II. The number of intellectuals in China is not large to begin with. In the process of further recovery and development of national construction undertakings, the need for and lack of intellectuals will be increasingly felt. However, due to various reasons, mainly due to the serious defects of the separation of learning from application and the lack of a perspective of serving the people that generally exist among intellectuals caused by the past education system, great difficulties arise when the state needs to employ them. Therefore, the basic policy for handling unemployed intellectuals in the future should be to help them obtain or increase the perspective and skills of serving the people through training or other means, and to absorb them as much as possible to participate in various practical work of national construction and social service.

    III. The scope of handling unemployed intellectuals is as follows: (1) Those who have a degree of high school graduation or equivalent or higher, have had a job and are currently unemployed, or have not yet obtained a job; (2) Those who have considerable knowledge and enjoy considerable prestige in the local area, are willing to serve the people, but are unable to live due to old age or physical weakness and are now unable to undertake arduous work.

    However, a small number of intellectuals who have degenerated into special agents, local bullies, and those who committed serious crimes against the people during the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are not within the scope of these measures.

    IV. For the unemployed intellectuals stipulated in Article III, Paragraph 1 of these instructions, the following measures may be taken after deliberation (for some unemployed intellectuals whose conditions meet the provisions of Article III of the Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers, they should still be handled by the local committees for relieving unemployed workers in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers and with reference to the following measures):

    A. People's Revolutionary Universities or schools of the same nature in various places should stipulate a certain quota to absorb appropriate unemployed intellectuals to enroll, and after learning, distribute them to participate in work or make other appropriate arrangements as much as possible.

    B. Government departments in various places that lack staff should plan to organize various professional training programs, absorb unemployed intellectuals to provide training, and then assign them to participate in work.

    C. In the work of developing worker-peasant education and literacy education, education departments in various places may recruit unemployed intellectuals to serve as cultural instructors and other appropriate jobs. Other construction work (such as cooperation, water conservancy, etc.) that requires intellectual cadres may also absorb them in the same way.

    V. In order to facilitate the adjustment of the phenomenon that some places lack intellectuals while other places have unemployed intellectuals, when people's governments at the county, city, or higher level encounter a shortage of intellectuals, they should report the types and numbers of intellectuals lacking to the civil affairs departments or personnel departments of the people's government at the next higher level, so as to make appropriate allocation.

    VI. For the unemployed intellectuals stipulated in Article III, Paragraph 2 of these instructions, the people's governments of each province, county, and city shall, based on the actual situation, adopt appropriate measures to absorb them to participate in work. The required funds shall be raised by the local government, but may be submitted to the people's government at the next higher level for appropriate subsidies as needed.

    VII. The work of handling unemployed intellectuals shall be planned and guided by the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, together with relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Labor; the large administrative regions, provinces, and cities shall designate appropriate agencies to plan and guide the work according to local conditions by the military and political committees of the large administrative regions' people's governments and the provincial and municipal people's governments.

    VIII. The necessary subsidies for handling unemployed intellectuals shall be allocated from the relief fund of the Central People's Government.

                                                  Premier Zhou Enlai
                                       January 12, 1951

　　中央人民政府政务院
    关于处理失业知识分子的补充指示
    一、半年以来，由于国家财政经济情况开始好转，各种建设事业渐多恢复，又由于本院先后发布之救济失业工人指示及救济失业教师与处理学生失学问题指示及由本院批准之救济失业工人暂行办法已在各地实施，使过去国民党反动统治所造成的大批失业知识分子已有一部分就业或获得物质救济。但在上述指示与办法中所规定的失业知识分子以外，还有其他失业知识分子的处理问题亦应予以适当的解决。为了积极增进各种失业知识分子就业的机会和条件，并逐步助其就业，特补发如下指示，望各级人民政府和有关主管部门认真执行。
    二、中国现有知识分子为数本不多，在国家建设事业进一步恢复和发展的过程中，将日益感到知识分子的需要和缺乏。但由于种种原因，主要由于过去教育制度所造成的知识分子一般存在着学用脱节与缺乏为人民服务观点的严重缺陷，致国家需要录用他们时发生很大困难。因此今后处理失业知识分子的基本方针，应当是经过训练或其他方式，帮助他们获得或增加为人民服务的观点和技能，尽可能吸收他们参加国家建设和社会服务的各种实际工作。
    三、处理失业知识分子的范围如下：（一）凡程度在高中毕业以上或相当于高中毕业以上，曾有职业而目前失业者，或迄未获得职业者；（二）具有相当学识并在地方上有相当声望的人士，愿为人民服务，但因年老或身体衰弱，现在不能担任辛劳工作而无法生活者。
    但少数知识分子堕落成为特务、恶霸及曾在蒋匪帮统治时期犯有反对人民的严重罪恶者，不在本办法处理范围之内。
    四、对于本指示第三条第一款所规定之失业知识分子，可依照下列各款斟酌处理（其中有一部分失业知识分子其条件符合于救济失业工人暂行办法第三条所规定者，应仍由各地救济失业工人委员会依照救济失业工人暂行办法并参照下列各款处理）：
    甲、各地人民革命大学或同样性质之学校，应规定一定名额吸收适当的失业知识分子入学，经过学习后尽可能分配他们参加工作或作其他适当处理。
    乙、各地缺乏工作人员之政府部门，应计划举办各种专业训练，吸收失业知识分子给予训练后分配其参加工作。
    丙、各地教育部门，在开展工农教育及识字教育工作中，可招考失业知识分子担任文化教员及其他适当工作，其他建设工作（如合作、水利等）需要知识分子干部者亦可用同样方式吸收之。
    五、为便于调整一些地方缺乏知识分子而另一些地方知识分子失业的现象，各县、市级以上人民政府遇有缺乏知识分子情况时，应将所缺知识分子的种类和数目层报上级人民政府民政部门或人事部门，以便适当调配。
    六、对于本指示第三条第二款所规定之失业知识分子，应由各省、县、市人民政府根据实际情况，采取适当办法，吸收他们参加工作。其所需经费由地方自筹，但得视需要呈请上级人民政府予以适当补助。
    七、处理失业知识分子工作，中央由政务院文化教育委员会会同人事部、内务部、劳动部等有关机关计划指导之；大行政区、省、市由大行政区人民政府军政委员会及省、市人民政府依当地情况指定适当机关计划指导之。
    八、处理失业知识分子所必需之补助费，由中央人民政府之救济事业费中拨付之。
                                                  总理周恩来
                                       一九五一年一月十二日
