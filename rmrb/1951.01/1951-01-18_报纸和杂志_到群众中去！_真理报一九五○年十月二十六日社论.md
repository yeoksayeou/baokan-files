　　Newspapers and Magazines—Go to the Masses!
    Editorial of Pravda, October 26, 1950

    Half a century ago, when Lenin laid the foundation for the first Marxist newspaper in Russia, *Iskra*, he established the great principle of a new type of newspaper as a collective propagandist, a collective agitator, and a collective organizer. Comrade Stalin said in the editorial of the first issue of the Social Democratic newspaper *The Struggle*, published in Georgia—the best Marxist newspaper besides *Iskra*—: "The newspaper should give clear answers to all questions concerning the workers' movement, should explain various principles, theoretically explain the role of the working class in the struggle, and illuminate every phenomenon encountered by the workers with the light of scientific socialism."
    The Bolshevik press, consistently implementing the instructions of the brilliant leaders Lenin and Stalin, has become the sharpest and most powerful weapon of our Party; it has become the propagandist of the Party's great ideas and the organizer of the masses in the struggle for communist construction.
    The Soviet press—is a truly people's press, firmly connected with the working masses and reflecting their vital interests. Therefore, it enjoys the infinite trust, ardent love, and full support of the Soviet people. People carefully listen to the voice of our press. Soviet people regard the newspaper as their best friend and advisor, helping them in their work, study, life, struggle, and victory.
    The press has developed rapidly in our country. More than seven thousand seven hundred newspapers are published in the Soviet Union, with a circulation of more than thirty-three million copies. We also publish hundreds of magazines, which also circulate in millions of copies. In addition to the central newspapers, each republic, province, region, and almost every district publishes its own newspapers. In our country, newspapers are published in a total of one hundred and nineteen languages. There are newspapers and magazines specifically for children, teenagers, and women, as well as newspapers and magazines on various aspects of the national economy, science, technology, and art. We have created all the conditions to most fully and comprehensively meet the political and cultural needs of the broadest strata of the working people—workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals.
    This vast scale of newspaper and magazine publishing is only possible in our country, because our country has true freedom of the press to serve the interests of the working people. The solid connection between the press and the masses is particularly clearly manifested in important political movements such as the Soviet elections. Our press faithfully serves the people, so the Soviet people cherish and love their press extraordinarily.
    Soviet people show special interest in their press. Therefore, the distribution of newspapers and magazines acquires great political significance.
    This important national task is entrusted to the Soviet Ministry of Communications. Its agency is the "Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines." This agency has done a lot of work, but it must be pointed out that the work of the Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines cannot meet the growing needs of life. The Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines has failed to organize the free purchase of newspapers and magazines in collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations far from the provincial centers. Even in many district centers and railway stations, the Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines has not established sales outlets for periodicals. In many districts, the Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines does not have kiosks for selling newspapers and magazines.
    Therefore, tens of thousands of readers who hope to be able to regularly buy newspapers at kiosks are deprived of the possibility of achieving their hope. Newspapers and magazines often do not reach the readers and are piled up in the warehouses of post and telecommunications offices, thus causing serious losses to the country and the cause of mass political education.
    The editorial department of *Pravda* has received many letters from various cities and villages, stating that many central newspapers and literary, artistic, women's, children's, and medical magazines cannot be subscribed to. Many letter writers rightly pointed out the intolerable fact that newspapers are received late.
    The Ministry of Communications should seemingly eliminate these bureaucratic obstacles that hinder the smooth distribution of newspapers and magazines among residents and prevent them from quickly reaching readers in every corner of our vast motherland. However, the Ministry of Communications has until recently provided insufficient leadership and supervision over the work of the Joint Central Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines.
    The success of any cause depends on people, on cadres, and the Party teaches us to select cadres based on political and professional knowledge. Many branches of the Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines have violated this principle of selecting cadres and selected cadres based on friendship. As a result, the important work of distributing newspapers has sometimes fallen into the hands of people who lack initiative and cannot organize things. Especially in the provinces of Velikoluk, Irkutsk, Kursk, and Stalingrad, the distribution of newspapers is organized most weakly.
    Currently, the subscription work for newspapers and magazines for 1951 is underway nationwide. The responsibility of local Party organizations is to help the smooth progress of this work. More free and individual subscription points should be opened in factories, agencies, and schools, in machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms. We should also more widely absorb activists—collective farmers, Youth League members, and book deliverers from public libraries—to participate in the distribution of newspapers and magazines. A wide organization of periodical retail sales in various post and telecommunications branches, agencies, and through collective farm postmen is a primary task. The Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines should expand kiosks selling newspapers, magazines, and books in district centers, large workers' residential areas, collective farms, state farms, and railway stations.
    The institutions of the Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines pay little attention to good advertising and publicity for publications. Many magazines and newspapers published domestically are not adequately notified to residents. The Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines, for some reason, has not organized widespread notification of periodicals through newspapers, radio, the publication of specialized propaganda paintings, etc., so that every citizen can know all the newspapers and magazines published domestically, familiarize every citizen with the conditions of subscription, and freely subscribe to any newspaper or magazine they like.
    Caring about the distribution of the press is an important component of all the work of newspapers and magazines. Soviet readers are demanding readers. The editorial departments of newspapers and magazines should always care about more completely and comprehensively meeting all the gradually increasing needs of readers, always care about expanding topics, strengthening content, and improving the literary quality of the published materials.
    Ensuring that readers receive newspapers and magazines on time is of great significance. However, for example, in some areas of Kazakhstan, newspapers are received very late and infrequently. Often, several days' worth of newspapers are delivered to readers in bundles. Some magazines are often overdue by many weeks. The struggle for the timely publication of newspapers and magazines, the struggle for timely delivery, is the most important task.
    The responsibility of local Party organizations is to constantly pay attention to the issue of extending newspapers and magazines to the masses, constantly guide the work of the institutions of the Joint Publishing Bureau of Newspapers and Magazines, and consolidate them with qualified cadres. The Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the various union republics, the regional committees, and the provincial committees are responsible for ensuring the timely publication of local periodicals and their timely delivery to readers.
    More attention should be paid to the cause of newspaper distribution, because they are of great significance for communist education and mobilizing the masses to participate in communist construction.

　　报纸和杂志—到群众中去！
    真理报一九五○年十月二十六日社论
    半世纪以前，当列宁奠定了全俄第一个马克思主义者的报纸《火星报》的基础之后，确定了做为集体的宣传者、集体的鼓动者和集体的组织者的新型报纸的伟大原则。斯大林同志在格鲁吉亚出版的社会民主党报《斗争报》——除《火星报》外最好的马克思主义者的报纸——第一期的社论中说道：“报纸应该对一切有关工人运动的问题给予明确回答，应当说明各个原则问题，从理论上说明工人阶级在斗争中的作用，并用科学社会主义的光芒来照明工人所遇到的每一种现象”。
    布尔什维克的报刊，始终不渝地执行着天才领袖列宁及斯大林的指示，成为了我党最尖锐的、最有力的武器；成为了党的伟大思想的宣传员，成为了群众在争取共产主义建设斗争中的组织者。
    苏维埃报刊——是真正人民的报刊，与劳动群众巩固地连系着并反映他们的切身利益。因此它享有苏联人民无限的信任、热烈的爱护和全面的支持。人民都仔细倾听着我们报刊的呼声。苏维埃人把报纸当做帮助他工作、学习、生活、斗争和胜利的最好朋友和顾问。
    报刊在我国发展得很快。在苏联出版有七千七百种以上报纸。发行期数在三千三百万份以上。我们还出版有数百种杂志，也发行有数百万份。除去中央的报纸以外，在各共和国、各省、各边区以及几乎各区中，都出版有自己的报纸。在我国，共有一百一十九种文字出版的报纸。有专门给孩子们、少年们及妇女们读的报纸和杂志，同时也有关于国民经济、科学、技术、艺术各方面的报纸与杂志。我们创造了一切条件，为了最完全地和全面地满足劳动者最广泛的阶层——工人、集体农民、知识分子——的政治和文化需要。
    报纸和杂志出版的这种广大规模，只有在我国才有可能，因为我国有为劳动者谋利益的真正出版自由。报刊与人民群众的巩固联系，特殊清晰地表现在像苏维埃选举这种重要的政治运动中。我们的报刊忠诚地服务于人民，因此苏维埃人民异常看重并爱护自己的报刊。
    苏维埃人们对自己的报刊表现着特殊的兴趣。因此，报刊的发行就获得巨大的政治意义。
    这个重要的国家任务是责成苏联邮电部来执行的。其机构是“报刊联合发行局”。这个机构曾做了大量工作，然而不得不指出报刊联合发行局的工作是不能满足生活上增长着的需要的。报刊联合发行局在离省中心遥远的集体农场、国营农场和机器拖拉机站上，未能组织报纸和杂志的自由购买。甚至在许多区中心和火车站，报刊联合发行局都没有建立定期出版物的出售机构。报刊联合发行局在许多区中都没有出售报纸及杂志的小亭。
    因此，数万希望能经常在小亭买到报纸的读者们，就被剥夺了达到希望的可能。报纸和杂志时常达不到读者的手中，而堆放在邮电局办公处的货栈中，因此给国家及群众的政治教育事业带来了严重的损失。
    《真理报》编辑部从各个城市和乡村接到了许多信件，述说不能订到许多中央报纸，也不能订到文学艺术的、妇女的、儿童的和医学的杂志。许多写信的人正当地指出了迟迟收到报纸这令人难以忍受的事实。
    邮电部对于这种妨碍报纸与杂志在居民之间顺利发行、妨碍很快地使它们达到我们辽阔祖国各个角落的读者的官僚主义的障碍物，似乎是应该铲除了。但是邮电部直至最近对于报刊联合中央发行局的工作，仍然领导和监督得很不够。
    任何事业的成功都决定于人，决定于干部，党教导我们选拔干部要依政治的和业务的知识。报刊联合发行局的许多支局，都破坏了这一选拔干部的原则，而以朋友的关系选拔干部。结果，使发行报刊的重要工作，时而落到一些缺乏主动性、不会组织事情的人们手中。尤其在维利科路克、伊尔库特、库尔斯基和斯大林格勒各省，报刊的发行工作组织得最为薄弱。
    现在，全国正在进行着订阅一九五一年报纸及杂志的工作。地方党组织的责任，是帮助这一工作的顺利进行。在工厂、机关和学校中，在机器拖拉机站、集体农场和国营农场中，应该更多开办一些自由单独订阅所。也应该更广泛地吸收积极分子——集体农民、青年团员和公共图书馆的送书人——参加报纸和杂志的发行工作。在各个邮电分局、代办所和通过集体农场的邮差的广泛的期刊零售组织，是首要的事业。报刊联合发行局应该在区中心、大的工人住宅区、集体农场、国营农场以及火车站上，扩大出售报纸、杂志及书籍的小亭。
    报刊联合发行局各机构，不大注意刊物的很好的广告宣传。国内出版的许多杂志和报纸，对居民的通知都不够。报刊联合发行局不知为什么没有通过报纸、广播、出刊专门宣传画等方法组织定期出版物的广泛通知，以使每个公民能够知道国内出版的全部报纸及杂志，使每个公民熟习订阅的条件，能自由地订阅他所喜欢的任何报纸或杂志。
    关心报刊的发行，是报纸及杂志全部工作中一个重要的组成部分。苏维埃读者是要求严格的读者。报纸和杂志的编辑部应该时时关心更完全、全面地满足读者逐渐增长着的一切需要，时时关心扩充题材，加强内容及改善所刊出材料的文学品质。
    使读者按时收到报纸及杂志，是具有重大意义的。但是，例如在卡查赫斯坦的一些区中，报纸收到得很迟并且是不经常的。时常把好几天的报纸成捆地交给读者。有一些杂志时常脱期许多星期。为报纸及杂志的按时出版而斗争，为按时送到而斗争，均是最重要的任务。
    地方党组织的责任，是要经常注意推广报纸和杂志到群众中去的问题，时时指导报刊联合发行局各机构的工作，并以有资格的干部巩固它们。各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、边区委会和省委会，有责保证按时出版地方期刊并按时送达读者。
    对于报刊的发行事业应该多加注意，因为它们对于共产主义教育和动员群众参加共产主义建设具有重大的意义。
    报纸和杂志——到群众中去！
