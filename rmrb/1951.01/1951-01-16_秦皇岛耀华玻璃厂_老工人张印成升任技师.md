　　Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory
　　Veteran Worker Zhang Yincheng Promoted to Technician

Editor:

　　I'm writing to tell you about a glorious event for our workers: Zhang Yincheng, an old worker in the bricklaying department of Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory (a joint state-private enterprise), has recently been promoted to technician.

　　Old Zhang is sixty-one years old this year. He was born into a poor peasant family, and his mother passed away shortly after he was born. He never attended school for a single day due to the pressures of life. Out of necessity, he became a bricklayer's apprentice at the age of sixteen. He joined the Yaohua Factory when it was first built in 1923, and now has twenty-eight years of experience in the factory and forty-five years of total work experience.

　　Old Zhang usually studies diligently. Every time the large kiln undergoes a cold repair, although he is illiterate, he draws diagrams on the ground with chalk and often studies them carefully with his colleagues, accumulating a wealth of experience. Old Zhang knows where each of the more than three hundred types of special-shaped bricks for the large kiln belong, just by picking one up. Since liberation, he has consistently worked actively, arriving early and leaving late, often encouraging his fellow workers, saying: "You young people are capable, you must study carefully, ensure that there are no problems with the work, and strive to earn merit and become model workers."

　　Last July, when the first cold repair of the large kiln since liberation began, Old Zhang actively helped the engineers improve the kiln design. For example, at the filling port, following his suggestion, ordinary refractory bricks were used instead of expensive high-alumina bricks. He also used old materials to save on new materials, converting large old silica bricks into smaller ones, solving the problem of the shortage of new silica bricks and saving more than half the labor. Throughout the kiln repair process, Old Zhang cooperated very closely with the engineers, ensuring the smooth completion of the project. When someone asked Old Zhang why he was working so hard, he said: "Repairing the kiln this year is something that hasn't happened for many years. In the past, we were treated like beasts of burden. Now we workers can finally hold our heads high and be masters of our own fate. How can we not complete the task ahead of schedule!"

　　All the employees of the factory believe that Old Zhang has made a great contribution to the people's enterprise. At the recent factory management committee meeting, a resolution was passed to promote Zhang Yincheng to technician; this resolution was immediately approved by the company.

### 秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂　　老工人张印成升任技师

　　秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂
    老工人张印成升任技师编辑同志：
    告诉你们一件咱工人的光荣事儿：秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂（公私合营）瓦工部老工人张印成，最近被提升为技师了。
    老张今年六十一岁了，生在贫农家里，母亲在他生下来不久便去世了，从小没念过一天书。由于生活所迫，他十六岁便当瓦匠学徒。一九二三年耀华厂初建时就到厂里来干活，现在已经有二十八年的厂龄和四十五年的工龄了。
    老张平时肯苦心研究，每次冷修大窑时，虽不识字，也拿粉笔在地上画图，并经常和伙计们细心研究，积累了很丰富的经验。大窑三百多种异形砖，老张随便拿起一块来就知道是那里的。解放后他一贯工作积极，早来晚走，经常鼓励工友们说：“你们年青人能干，要多细心研究，保证工作不出毛病，争取立功当模范。”
    去年七月，开始了解放以来第一次冷修大窑时，老张积极帮助工程师改进大窑式样。如填料口，经过了他的建议，用普通耐火砖代替了价格昂贵的高铝砖；采用旧料省新料，把旧矽砖由大改小，解决了缺乏新矽砖的困难，并且省工一倍以上。整个修窑过程，老张和工程师配合得非常紧密，使工程得以顺利完成。有人问老张为什么这样卖劲，他说：“今年修窑是多少年来没有过的事：以往当牛马，现在咱工人吐气扬眉当主人，不提前完成任务那还行！”
    全厂职工认为老张对人民企业贡献很大，在最近的工厂管委会上，通过了提升张印成为技师的决议；这个决议并且立刻得到公司的批准。
