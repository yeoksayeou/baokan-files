A Letter from a Korean People's Army Officer to Chinese Mothers

Dear Chinese Mothers:

　　I am writing this letter in a very small village in Korea.

　　This village, which your brave children and we have just jointly liberated, has been ravaged by the enemies, just like all the places in Korea they have reached. Everything the farmers here built in the five years after the August 15th Liberation has been destroyed by the enemy.

　　As we watched this lovely village in the bitter cold, we could no longer see traces of its former self. The destroyed village looked exceptionally desolate.

　　Facing this desolate village, we swore to eliminate the enemy.

　　The people of this village are bravely rising up to build a new life.

　　With the warm support of the people, we liberated the areas forcibly occupied by the enemy. On the battlefield, we received the clothes you sewed stitch by stitch. We will eliminate more enemies than the number of stitches sewn by the mothers.

　　Dear Chinese Mothers! Your children are truly brave and kind people. Like the blood of the martyrs dyed on the five-star red flag of New China, they are shedding blood for the happiness of the Korean people and engaging in heroic struggle.

　　Our friendship forged in blood is growing stronger day by day.

　　Your strong calls make us even braver to eliminate the enemies. We are surrounded by our Korean mothers, Chinese mothers, and mothers all over the world. We have received the support and solidarity of peace-loving people all over the world, led by the Soviet Union.

　　We believe that the Chinese and Korean people will surely win the final victory.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Korean People's Army Officer Yun Binghou

　　朝鲜人民军一军官写给中国母亲们的信亲爱的中国母亲们：
    我在朝鲜一个很小的村庄里写这封信。
    你们勇敢的孩子们和我们刚刚协同解放的这个村庄，像仇敌们所到的朝鲜所有地方一样，被他们蹂躏得体无完肤。八·一五解放后的五年中，这里农民所建设的一切都被敌人破坏了。
    当我们在酷寒中注视着这可爱的村庄时，我们看不到昔日的痕迹了。这被毁的村庄显得异常凄凉。
    我们面对着这凄凉的村庄，宣誓要消灭敌人。
    这村庄的人们，正在为建设新的生活而勇敢地站起来了。
    我们在人民热烈的声援下，解放了敌人强占的地区。在战场上我们收到你们一针一针缝起来的衣服。我们要更多的消灭敌人比母亲们所缝的针数还要多。
    亲爱的中国母亲们！你们的孩子们，是真正勇敢和善良的人。他们和新中国五星红旗上染着的先烈的鲜血一样，正在为朝鲜人民的幸福流着鲜血，进行英雄斗争。
    我们以血结成的友谊日益增强了。
    你们强烈的呼声使我们更加勇敢的去消灭仇敌。我们的身旁有着我们朝鲜的母亲、中国的母亲和全世界的母亲。我们受到了以苏联为首的全世界爱好和平人民的支持和声援。
    我们相信中国和朝鲜人民必定能赢得最后的胜利。
                                      朝鲜人民军一军官尹炳厚
              （此信原刊载一九五○年十二月三十日朝鲜“劳动新闻”）
