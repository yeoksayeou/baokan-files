    Our Great Motherland
    The Northeast Martyrs Memorial Hall is located on Yiman Street in Nangang, Harbin. Previously, this was the police station of the Japanese invaders and the puppet Manchukuo, used to suppress patriotic people in our country. Now, those vile executioners have long since vanished, but the heroes who sacrificed themselves generously for national independence and people's democracy will be immortal in our memory and in the memory of our descendants. The memorial hall displays the martyrs' photographs, blood-stained clothing, and other relics. Let us always remember them, learn from them, and dedicate our lives, without reservation, to our great motherland!

    我们伟大的祖国
    东北烈士馆，在哈尔滨市南岗一曼街。在以前，这里是日寇、伪满镇压我国爱国人民的警察厅。现在那些卑污的刽子手们早已烟消云散，但是为民族独立和人民民主而慷慨牺牲的英雄们，却在我们和我们后代的记忆中永垂不朽。纪念馆内陈列着烈士们的照片、血衣和其他遗物。让我们时时想着他们，学习他们，把我们的生命同样无保留地献给我们伟大的祖国罢！
