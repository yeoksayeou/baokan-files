To the Editorial Department:

　　Martyr Liang Gui from our village (Xigezhuang, Tenth District, Fengrun County, Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province) has been dead for four years. However, his family has not yet received the treatment due to the family of a revolutionary martyr. The local government has been indifferent to this issue.

　　Comrade Liang Gui joined our army in September 1945 and gloriously sacrificed his life in battle on May 13, 1946 (I was a trainee staff officer in the staff office of his regiment at that time). At that time, the troops were in a combat environment, and it was impossible to send the death certificate of Comrade Liang Gui back to his village. Later (the letter did not specify the year – Editor), I was transferred back to work in the Jidong Military Region and told the village cadres and his family about the sacrifice of Comrade Liang Gui. At that time, the village cadres immediately reported this situation to the district government. After verification by the district government, a certificate for the family of a revolutionary martyr was issued, stating that they could take the certificate to the county people's government to collect relief grain. To this end, Liang Gui's father, Liang Baowan, repeatedly asked the district government when he could receive it, but the answer was "later." In November 1950, when he went to the county people's government to collect relief grain, the staff said that the certificate had expired and could not be paid; and the certificate was kept.

　　Now his family has no labor force and is living in extreme difficulty. However, the county government is not concerned at all, and until now, his family has not received the preferential treatment due to the family of a revolutionary martyr.

　　Now it is difficult to find proof from the original unit of Comrade Liang Gui because the unit has changed its organizational structure many times. Therefore, I am telling you what I know in the hope that you can help solve the problem.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhang Peiting

　　Editor's Note: Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on Commendation and Compensation for the Sacrifice and Death of Revolutionary Soldiers stipulates: "For revolutionary soldiers who have sacrificed for a long time and whose families cannot obtain a certificate from the original unit, if other relevant parties can provide proof, the county (city) or higher people's government may approve them to enjoy the treatment of a martyr's family." Since Comrade Liang Gui's sacrifice can be proved by Comrade Zhang Peiting and has long been verified by the district government, the Fengrun County People's Government should approve his family to enjoy the treatment of a revolutionary martyr's family.

### 河北省丰润县人民政府  不该拖延解决烈属问题

　　河北省丰润县人民政府
    不该拖延解决烈属问题编辑同志：
    我村（河北省唐山专区丰润县第十区溪歌庄）烈士梁贵同志，牺牲已四年。可是，他家现在还没有得到革命烈士家属的待遇。当地政府对此问题，一直是漠不关心。
    梁贵同志在一九四五年九月参加我军，一九四六年五月十三日，在战斗中光荣牺牲（那时我在他所属团的参谋处任见习参谋）。当时部队正处在作战环境，无法将梁贵同志之牺牲证明书寄回本村。后来（来信未说明年月——编者）我调回冀东军区工作，就把梁贵同志牺牲经过告知本村干部及其家属。当时本村干部即将此情况反映给区政府。经区政府调查属实，就发给革命烈士家属证明书一份；并说明：可持此证明书去县人民政府领抚恤粮。为此，梁贵同志的父亲梁宝万曾多次向区政府询问何时可领，但答复是以后再说。到一九五○年十一月，再到县人民政府领取抚恤粮，工作人员却说该证明书早已过期，不能照付；并将证明书给留下了。
    现在他家中已无劳动力，生活极困难。但该县政府却毫不关心，直到现在，他家还未取得革命烈士家属的优待。
    现在梁贵同志原属部队因多次变更建制，已很难找到证明了。因此我特把所了解的情况告诉你们，希望你们帮助解决。
                  张佩庭
    编者按：革命军人牺牲、病故褒恤暂行条例第六条规定：“凡牺牲已久之革命军人，其家属无法取得原部队证明书者，经其他有关方面证明，由县（市）以上人民政府批准，亦得按烈属优待之。”烈士梁贵的牺牲，既有张佩庭同志可以证明，并早经区政府调查属实，丰润县人民政府就应该批准其家属享受革命烈士家属的待遇。
