　　Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: With the imperialist camp falling apart due to the repeated defeats of the American invading army in Korea, and the anti-war surge of the people of Western Europe rising day by day, the so-called "Supreme Command" of the North Atlantic Aggressor Forces, Eisenhower, hastily left the United States for Europe on the 6th, arriving in Paris on the 7th. He will travel to various Western European countries to piece together his army, which is still only "on paper," attempting to force America's Western European puppets to contribute men and money. However, the general reaction to the future of this mission is very bleak.
　　Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th, pointed out: On the one hand, Eisenhower's "mission is becoming more difficult" due to the rising voices in the United States represented by Hoover and Taft calling for "withdrawal from Europe," and on the other hand, he faces a Western Europe that is losing trust in the United States and therefore increasingly hesitant about its rearmament policy. United Press, London, 6th, admitted: "Europe has just recovered from the panic of former US President Hoover's proposal to abandon the continent and is today again shaken by Senator Taft's speech attacking US foreign policy." "Most European countries have not fully engaged in rearmament, and many countries, like France, are unwilling to do so." United Press, Paris, 8th, also pointed out: "Eisenhower is for the first time aware of the old disease of too little, too late hesitation and indecision, and the unwillingness to face an unprepared situation, which threatens European rearmament. France is a prime example of the greatest weakness of the North Atlantic Treaty—unwillingness to fully engage in rearmament—." "Eisenhower received the most optimistic promises from the highest French officials, but lurking behind the promises is France's deep suspicion of American policy, its extreme reluctance to make the necessary sacrifices to build a truly effective French army, its great fear that any major action on rearmament might become a signal for Russia to enter Western Europe, and its hope that it may still be possible to deal with Russia." Agence France-Presse revealed the fear of well-informed sources in Paris about a failed war of aggression: "Some Americans only think of victory, while Europeans think of war itself." "Battleships and planes cannot prevent the occupation of Europe, and those countries that have experienced foreign occupation are not interested in re-recapturing lost ground."
　　This situation made Spofford, the US representative to the North Atlantic Treaty foreign minister's assistant meeting, particularly anxious. While seeking support for Eisenhower in London, he said: "Eisenhower needs the fullest support from the treaty countries in order to complete his mission." "I must frankly say that there is a great distance today between the manpower, weaponry, and money needed for adequate defense (should be read as aggressive force) and the quantity that already exists in these three areas."
　　Even Eisenhower himself could not help but express his annoyance in the face of this gloomy situation. Two days before leaving the United States, he stated at a press conference in Washington that his unified aggressor army "will not succeed unless all countries express their willingness to sacrifice." However, "as far as he knew, there was no clear commitment regarding the number of troops each country would provide to the unified army." After arriving in Paris, Eisenhower said in his statement in a low-key manner: "I have returned to Europe as a military commander this time, bringing neither magic tricks nor any forces." He called for the elimination of "hatred, suspicion, and distrust" between Western Europe and Britain and France.

### 艾森豪威尔赴欧拚凑侵略军  帝国主义阵营分崩离析前途渺茫

　　艾森豪威尔赴欧拚凑侵略军
    帝国主义阵营分崩离析前途渺茫
    【新华社九日讯】在帝国主义阵营因美国侵朝军一败再败而陷于分崩离析，西欧各国人民反对战争的怒潮日益高涨的情形下，北大西洋侵略军的所谓“最高司令部”艾森豪威尔已于六日匆匆离美赴欧，七日抵达巴黎，为拚凑他那支迄今仍是“纸上”的军队而将奔走西欧各国，企图逼迫美国的西欧仆从出人出钱。但是对这个使命的前途如何，普遍的反应是十分渺茫。
    法新社巴黎六日电指出：艾森豪威尔一方面因美国国内以胡佛、塔夫脱为代表的“退出欧洲”的呼声日高而使其“任务更加棘手”，一方面又面对着对美国失掉信任因而在备战政策上犹疑日增的西欧。合众社伦敦六日电承认：“欧洲刚刚从美国前总统胡佛放弃大陆的建议的惊惶中复原过来，今日已再度因参议员塔夫脱攻击美国外交政策的演说而震荡起来”。“大多数欧洲国家尚未全力进行重整军备，许多国家像法国一样不愿那样做。”该社巴黎八日电亦指出：“艾森豪威尔第一次觉察到又发生那种太少太迟的老病的犹豫不决，摇摆不定，心中不愿与毫无准备的情况，这种情况威胁着欧洲重整军备。法国是表明北大西洋公约的最大弱点——不愿全力进行重整军备——的典范。”“艾森豪威尔从法国最高级官员那里获得最乐观的诺言，但潜伏在诺言背后的则是法国十分怀疑美国政策，极不愿意为了建立真正有效的法国军队而作必要的牺牲，非常害怕任何有关重整军备的重要行动都可能成为俄国进入西欧的信号，而希望着仍然可能和俄国打交道。”法新社透露巴黎消息灵通人士对于一个失败的侵略战争的恐惧说：“有些美国人只想到胜利，而欧洲人则想到战争本身。”“战舰和飞机并不能防止欧洲的被占领，而那些曾经历过外国占领的国家对于从地面上来重新收复失地一事并不感到兴趣。”
    这种情况，使得北大西洋公约外长助理会议美国代表斯波福特别焦急，他在伦敦为艾森豪威尔寻求支持时说：“艾森豪威尔要由公约国给他最充分的支持，方能完成其任务。”“我必须坦白地说：今天适当的防务（应读为侵略力量）所需要的人力、兵器与金钱和现在在这三方面的已有的数量之间存在着很大的距离。”
    甚至连艾森豪威尔自己也不能不在这种阴暗的情景之前无可掩饰地表示其烦恼。他离美前两天就在华盛顿记者招待会上表示：他的统一侵略军“除非所有的国家都表示愿意牺牲，不然就不会成功”。然而，“就他所知，关于每个国家向统一军提供的军队的数目，并没有明确的承诺”。艾森豪威尔到达巴黎以后，在他发表的声明中低调地说：“我这次回到欧洲担任军事指挥官，既没有带来锦囊妙计，也没有带来什么兵力。”他要求西欧和英法之间消除“仇恨、猜疑和不信任”。
