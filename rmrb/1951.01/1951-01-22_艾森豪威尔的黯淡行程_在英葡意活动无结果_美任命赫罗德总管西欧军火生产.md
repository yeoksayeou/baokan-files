Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Amidst a chorus of angry condemnation from the people of Western Europe, the American warmonger Eisenhower continues his dismal tour of the North Atlantic countries. After flying from Norway, Eisenhower arrived in London on the evening of the 13th, then Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, on the 16th, Rome, the capital of Italy, on the 17th, and Luxembourg on the 19th, holding talks with the governments of the aforementioned countries on establishing the North Atlantic unified aggressive military, which still exists only on paper. However, various sources indicate that, so far, Eisenhower has achieved little progress in realizing his own plans, except for stirring up waves of popular protest everywhere. According to a report by Agence France-Presse in London, Eisenhower, at a press conference held before leaving Britain, had to admit that in his meetings with various governments, "the general organizational problems have been studied, but specific military issues have not been discussed until now." According to United Press International: Eisenhower encountered the following situation after arriving in Lisbon: "He was told that Portugal is too small and too poor to contribute much. This is exactly what Eisenhower has already become familiar with in the six Atlantic countries he has visited." In Rome, Eisenhower encountered the strongest opposition from the Italian people, and at a press conference held upon his departure, he had to once again appeal to the vassal states to share the "burdens, sacrifices, and difficulties arising therefrom" in order to realize the establishment of his aggressive army.
This newspaper reports: According to Xinhua News Agency: US Secretary of Defense Marshall announced on the 15th the appointment of Harold, the general manager of "International General Electric Company," which belongs to the American financial magnate Morgan Group, as the so-called "Defense Production Coordinator" of the North Atlantic aggressive group. According to Marshall's announcement in his communique: Harold will uniformly coordinate and utilize the economic resources and industrial capabilities of various countries. This means that this American monopoly capitalist will control all the industries of Western European countries. The Manchester Guardian of the British Liberal Party called Harold "the Eisenhower in charge of production." However, Harold's mission, like Eisenhower's mission, has aroused the apprehension and resistance of Western European countries, especially the British bourgeoisie.

　　艾森豪威尔的黯淡行程
    在英葡意活动无结果
    美任命赫罗德总管西欧军火生产
    【新华社二十日讯】在西欧人民一片怒骂声中，美国战争贩子艾森豪威尔仍在北大西洋各国继续其黯淡的行程。艾森豪威尔自飞离挪威后，于十三日当晚抵达伦敦，于十六日抵葡萄牙首都里斯本，十七日抵意大利首都罗马，十九日抵卢森堡，都与上述各国政府会谈建立其尚在纸上的北大西洋统一侵略军事宜。但是，各方消息显示：迄今为止，艾森豪威尔除了到处激起人民的抗议怒潮而外，在实现他自己的计划方面没有获得什么进展。据法新社伦敦电透露，艾森豪威尔在离英前举行的记者招待会上，也不得不承认：在他与各国政府的会议中，“总的组织问题虽已研究过了，可是，直到现在还没有论及具体的军事问题。”另据合众社透露：艾森豪威尔在到达里斯本后遇到的情形是：“人家告诉他：葡萄牙太小太穷，不能多所贡献。这正是艾森豪威尔在他所到过的六个大西洋国家中已经听熟悉了的话。”在罗马，艾森豪威尔遭到意大利人民最强烈的反对，而在他离去时举行的记者招待会上，也不得不再次呼吁各仆从国家为实现建立其侵略军而分担“由此而产生的负担、牺牲和困难”。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：美国国防部长马歇尔已于十五日宣布任命美国大财阀摩根集团所属“国际奇异电气公司”的总经理赫罗德为北大西洋侵略集团的所谓“防务生产统筹专员”。据马歇尔在其公报中宣布：赫罗德将统一调度与使用各国经济资源与工业能力。这就意味着这个美国大垄断资本家将操纵西欧各国的全部工业。英国自由党的曼彻斯特卫报把赫罗德称做“掌管生产的艾森豪威尔”。但是，赫罗德的使命，也正像艾森豪威尔的使命一样，已引起西欧各国，特别是英国资产阶级的疑惧与抗拒。
