On the Party's Policy in Literature
Resolution of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), June 18, 1925

Editor's Note: The resolution of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On the Party's Policy in Literature" in June 1925 played an extremely important guiding role in the history of Soviet literature development. This historical document was translated from Japanese by Mr. Chen Xuefan twenty years ago, and now it has been re-translated from Russian by Comrade Cao Baohua. The historical conditions, class relations, and the development of proletarian literature during the Soviet New Economic Policy period were, of course, very different from those in China today. However, the basic principles proposed in this resolution regarding the Party's leadership in literary activities still have practical educational significance today. The resolution pointed out that the Party should treat intermediate writers thoughtfully and carefully, ensuring that they have all the conditions to transition to communist ideology as quickly as possible; the Party should help proletarian writers grow in every way, while preventing them from becoming arrogant and putting on airs of being communists; resolute struggle must be waged against the erroneous attitude of despising the old cultural heritage and literary experts; regarding the content of proletarian literature, the resolution pointed out that proletarian literature should "broadly grasp extremely complex phenomena, not confine itself to the scope of a factory, not create workshop literature, but create literature for the great fighting class leading millions of peasants"; in terms of literary form, the Party does not particularly support a certain literary school but advocates "free competition" among various groups and factions in the literary field; the Party actively guides literary criticism and creative activities, while avoiding administrative command methods in literary undertakings. This resolution is worth re-examining carefully.

I. The recent surge in the material welfare of the masses, coupled with the ideological transformation brought about by the revolution, the strengthening of mass initiative, the great expansion of horizons, etc., has created a huge increase in cultural demands and needs. Thus, we have entered the stage of cultural revolution, which is a prerequisite for continuing to advance towards a communist society.

II. A part of this mass cultural growth is the growth of new literature—primarily the growth of proletarian and peasant literature, from its embryonic but simultaneously unprecedentedly broad forms (workers' correspondence, rural correspondence, wall newspapers, etc.) to highly ideological literary and artistic works.

III. On the other hand, the economic process is extremely complex, with contradictory and even directly hostile economic forms growing simultaneously. This development leads to the emergence and growth of a new bourgeoisie, the emergence of a tendency, perhaps initially unconscious but inevitable, of some old and new intellectuals towards this bourgeoisie, and the chemical secretion from the depths of society of ideological representatives of this bourgeoisie, who are renewed day by day—all of this must inevitably and certainly be manifested on the literary surface of social life.

IV. Thus, just as the class struggle in our social life in general has not stopped, so the class struggle on the literary front has not stopped either. There is not and cannot be neutral art in a class society, although the expression of the class nature of art in general, especially literature, is infinitely more diverse than, for example, in the political field.

V. However, it would be completely wrong to ignore the basic facts of our social life, which is that the working class has gained power and the dictatorship of the proletariat is being implemented throughout the country.

Since the proletarian party incited class struggle before gaining power, implementing the line of overthrowing the entire society, then during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the problem facing the proletarian party is: how to get along with the peasants and gradually transform them; how to establish a certain degree of cooperation with the bourgeoisie and gradually squeeze them out; how to make the technical and other intellectuals serve the revolution and win them over ideologically from the bourgeoisie.

Thus, although the class struggle has not stopped, its form has changed, because before gaining power, the proletariat strived to overthrow the existing society, while during its dictatorship, it placed "peaceful organizational work" in the first place.

VI. The proletariat should maintain, consolidate, and increasingly expand its leadership, while also occupying considerable positions in many new areas of the ideological front. The process of dialectical materialism penetrating completely new fields (biology, psychology, general natural science) has already begun. Seizing positions in the literary field should also become a reality sooner or later.

VII. But it must be remembered that this task is infinitely more complex than the other tasks that the proletariat is solving, because the working class in capitalist society was already able to prepare itself to complete the victorious revolution, create cadres of fighters and leaders for itself, and create excellent ideological weapons for its political struggle. But it could not delve into natural science and technology problems at that time, and as a culturally oppressed class, it could not create its own literature, its own special art forms, and its own writing style. Although the proletariat now has the correct standard for the socio-political content of any literary work, it does not yet have the same definite answer to all questions of artistic form.

VIII. The policy of the leading proletarian party in literature should be determined based on the above-mentioned situation. The following are the main issues here: the relationship between proletarian writers and peasant writers and so-called "fellow travelers" and other writers; the Party's policy towards proletarian writers; the issue of criticism; the issue of the style and form of artistic works, and the methods of creating new art forms; and finally, the issue of organizational nature.

IX. The relationship between various writer groups distinguished according to the content of social classes or social groups is determined by our general policy. But here it must be noted that leadership in literature, as a whole, belongs to the working class, along with its material and ideological means. Proletarian writers do not yet have this leadership, and the Party should help these writers earn the historical right to grasp this leadership. Peasant writers should be welcomed warmly and enjoy our unconditional support. The task is to transfer their growing cadres to the track of proletarian ideology, but never to make their creations lose the characteristics of peasant literature, because these characteristics are a necessary prerequisite for influencing peasants.

X. Attention must be paid to "fellow travelers": (1) their differentiation; (2) the importance of many of them as skilled "experts" in literary techniques; (3) the wavering situation among this stratum of writers. The general policy here should be to treat them thoughtfully and carefully, that is, to adopt an attitude that can ensure that they have all the conditions to transition to communist ideology as quickly as possible. While excluding anti-proletarian and counter-revolutionary elements (which are now extremely few and insignificant), and struggling against the new bourgeois ideological system that is forming among some of the "fellow travelers" of the change-of-landmarks faction (note), the Party should tolerate intermediate ideological forms and patiently help these inevitably numerous forms gradually disappear in the process of increasingly close comrade cooperation with various communist cultural forces.

XI. The Party should adopt the following position towards proletarian writers: help them grow in every way, support them and their organizations in every way, and at the same time, use all means to prevent the most harmful phenomenon of putting on communist airs among them. Precisely because they are regarded as the future ideological leaders of Soviet literature, the Party should fight in every way against those who are frivolous and despise the old cultural heritage and literary experts. Similarly, the position of underestimating the importance of fighting for the ideological leadership of proletarian writers should also be condemned. Opposing surrender on the one hand and opposing putting on communist airs on the other—this should be the Party's slogan. The Party should also fight against attempts to cultivate "proletarian" literature purely in a greenhouse. Broadly grasp extremely complex phenomena, do not confine yourself to the scope of a factory, do not create workshop literature but create literature for the great fighting class leading millions of peasants—this is the scope of the content of proletarian literature.

XII. The task of criticism, as one of the main educational tools in the hands of the Party, is determined by the above-mentioned situation in general and as a whole. Without abandoning the communist position for a moment, without violating the proletarian ideology in the slightest, and revealing the objective class significance of various literary works, communist criticism should wage a relentless struggle against counter-revolutionary phenomena in literature, expose the liberalism of the change-of-landmarks faction, etc., and at the same time express the greatest thoughtfulness, prudence, and patience towards all literary strata that can and will move forward with the proletariat. Communist criticism should avoid using command tones in literature. This kind of criticism can only have profound educational significance when it relies on the superiority of its own ideology. Marxist criticism should expel arrogant, half-baked, and pretentious communist airs from its midst. Marxist criticism should put forward the slogan of "learning" for itself and should combat all nonsense and rubbish in its midst.

XIII. Having correctly recognized the socio-class content of various literary schools, the Party in general must not bind itself to supporting a certain tendency in terms of literary form. Since it leads the entire literature, the Party cannot support a certain literary faction (these factions are divided according to different views on form and style), just as the Party cannot solve the problem of family form by resolution, although in general it undoubtedly leads and should lead the construction of new life. Everything forces us to imagine that a style that is in line with the times will be created, but it will be created by other various methods, and the solution to this problem has not yet begun. At the current stage of our cultural development, any attempt to bind the Party in this regard should be rejected.

XIV. Therefore, the Party should advocate free competition among various groups and factions in this field. Solving this problem by any other method would inevitably be a bureaucratic fake solution. It is equally inadmissible to use directives or Party resolutions to grant a certain group or literary organization a legal monopoly on literary publishing. Although the Party supports proletarian literature and proletarian peasant literature materially and spiritually, and helps "fellow travelers," etc., it cannot allow even the most proletarian group in ideological content to implement a monopoly, because this would first destroy proletarian literature.

XV. The Party should use all means to eradicate attempts at arbitrary and incompetent administrative interference in literary undertakings. The Party should carefully pay attention to the selection of personnel in publishing organs in order to ensure truly correct, beneficial, and measured leadership of our literature.

XVI. The Party should point out to all literary workers the necessity of correctly dividing the functions of critics and literary writers. For the latter, it is necessary to shift the focus of their work to literary works in the true sense and to utilize the huge amount of modern material. The development of national literature in many republics and provinces of our Union must also be strengthened.

The Party should emphasize the necessity of creating literature that is read by a truly vast readership, by workers and peasants. We should break through literary aristocratic prejudices more boldly and decisively, and while utilizing all the achievements of old techniques, create appropriate forms that can be understood by hundreds of millions of people.

Only by solving this great task can Soviet literature and its future proletarian vanguard complete their cultural and historical mission.

(Note) The change-of-landmarks faction was a bourgeois political faction that emerged in 1921 among Russian bourgeois exiles abroad. It was named after a magazine called "Change of Landmarks." The change-of-landmarks faction reflected the views of the new bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals of Soviet Russia. Due to the implementation of the New Economic Policy, they abandoned the use of open armed struggle to oppose the Soviet regime, hoping that the Soviet system would gradually degenerate into an ordinary bourgeois republic. —Translator

### 关于党在文艺方面的政策  一九二五年六月十八日俄共（布）中央的决议

　　关于党在文艺方面的政策
    一九二五年六月十八日俄共（布）中央的决议
    编者按：一九二五年六月苏俄共产党（布）中央“关于党在文艺方面的政策”的决议，在苏联文学发展历史上起了极巨大的指导作用。这个历史文献早在二十年前已由陈雪帆先生从日文转译过来，现在由曹葆华同志根据俄文重新译出。这个决议发表于苏联新经济政策时期，当时的历史条件、阶级关系与无产阶级文学的发展情况和今天中国当然有很多的差别。但这个决议中所提出的关于党领导文学活动的基本原则在今天仍有现实的教育的意义。决议指出：党应当周到地和细心地对待中间作家，保证他们尽可能有迅速地转移到共产主义思想方面来的一切条件；党对待无产阶级作家，一方面以一切方法帮助他们成长，另一方面以一切手段防止他们骄傲，摆共产党员的架子；对于轻视旧文化遗产、轻视文艺专门家的错误态度必须进行坚决斗争；关于无产阶级文学的内容，决议指出：无产阶级文学应“广泛把握极其复杂的现象，不关闭在一个工厂范围内，不作车间的文学，而要作领导千百万农民的伟大战斗阶级的文学”；在文学形式方面，党不特别支持某一文学派别，而主张文学领域中各种集团和派别的“自由竞赛”；党积极地指导文学批评和创作的活动，而避免在文学事业上采取行政命令的办法。这个决议是值得我们很好地重新加以研究的。                  
    一、最近群众物质福利的高涨，连同革命所引起的思想的转变、群众积极性的加强、眼界的大大扩张等等，造成了文化的要求和需要的巨大增长。这样，我们进入了文化革命的阶段，而文化革命是向共产主义社会继续前进的先决条件。
    二、这种群众文化成长的一部分是新文学的成长——首先是无产阶级和农民的文学的成长，从其萌芽的但同时在范围方面空前广泛的形式（工人通讯、农村通讯、墙报及其他）起，直到思想性很强的文艺作品为止。
    三、另一方面，经济过程非常复杂，矛盾的以至互相直接敌对的经济形态同时增长，这个发展引起新资产阶级产生和壮大的过程，一部分新旧知识分子对于这种资产阶级发生虽然最初未必自觉的但却是必然的倾向，以及这种资产阶级的一天比一天更新的思想代表者从社会深处化学式地分泌出来，——所有这一切，也必然一定显现在社会生活的文学表面上。
    四、这样，正如在我国阶级斗争一般没有停止，同样阶级斗争在文学战线上也没有停止。在阶级社会中没有而且也不能有中立的艺术，虽然一般艺术、尤其是文学的阶级本性之表现形式，例如，较之在政治方面是更加无限地多种多样。
    五、但是，如果忽视我们社会生活的基本事实，那就会完全错误，而这个事实就是：工人阶级获得了政权，全国实行着无产阶级专政。
    既然无产阶级党在获得政权以前煽动阶级斗争，实行把整个社会推翻的路线，那末在无产阶级专政期中摆在无产阶级党面前的问题便是：怎样和农民相处一起，慢慢地改造他们；怎样和资产阶级建立某种程度的合作，慢慢地排挤他们；怎样使技术的和其他的一切知识分子为革命服务，在思想上把他们从资产阶级那里争取过来。
    这样，阶级斗争虽没有停止，但其形式则已改变，因为无产阶级在获得政权以前力求推翻现存社会，而在自己专政时期则把“和平组织事业”提到第一位。
    六、无产阶级应当保持、巩固、日益扩大自己的领导，同时要在思想战线许多新的领域中也占有相当的阵地。辩证唯物论之向完全新的领域（生物学、心理学、一般自然科学）的渗透过程，已经开始了。在文艺领域中夺取阵地，同样早晚应当成为事实。
    七、但是必须记住：这个任务是比无产阶级正在解决的其他任务更复杂得不知道多少，因为工人阶级在资本主义社会中已经能准备自己完成胜利的革命，给自己造就斗士和领导者干部，并给自己造成政治斗争的卓绝的思想武器。但是它当时不能钻研自然科学问题和技术问题，而且他既是文化上被压迫的阶级，同样也不能造成自己的文艺、自己的特别艺术形式、自己的文章风格。虽然无产阶级手中现在已经有对于任何文学作品的社会政治内容的正确标准，但是它对于艺术形式的一切问题却还没有同样确定的回答。
    八、领导的无产阶级党在文艺方面的政策，应当依据上述的情况来决定。在这里首先是下列的各个问题：无产阶级作家和农民作家与所谓“同路人”和其他作家之间的相互关系；党对于无产阶级作家的政策；批评问题；艺术作品的风格和形式问题，以及创造新艺术形式的方法问题；最后，是组织性质的问题。
    九、按照社会阶级或社会集团的内容而区分的各种作家集团之间的相互关系，是由我们总的政策来决定。但是在这里必须注意：文学方面的领导，整个地是属于工人阶级，连同它的物质的和思想的手段。无产阶级作家的领导权现在还没有，而党应当帮助这些作家给自己赢得掌握这个领导权的历史权利。农民作家应当受到友好的接待和享有我们无条件的支持。任务是在于把他们日益成长的干部转移到无产阶级思想的轨道上来，但是决不要使他们的创作失掉农民文艺的特色，因为这些特色是影响农民的必要前提。
    十、对于“同路人”必须注意：（一）他们的分化；（二）他们有许多人作为文学技术熟练“专家”之重要性；（三）这一作家阶层中间的动摇情况。一般的方针在这里应当是周到地和细心地对待他们，即采取这样的态度，可以保证他们尽可能有迅速地转移到共产主义思想方面来的一切条件。党在排除反无产阶级的和反革命的分子（现在是极其少得不足道了），同一部分路标转换派（注）的“同路人”中间正在形成的新资产阶级思想体系作斗争时，应当宽容地对待中间的思想形态，耐心地帮助这些必然很多的形态在与共产主义各种文化力量日益密切的同志合作过程中逐渐消失。
    十一、对于无产阶级作家，党应当采取这样的立场：以一切方法帮助他们成长，并用各种办法支持他们和他们的组织，同时还应当用一切手段防止他们中间摆共产党员架子这种最有害的现象的出现。正因为把他们看作苏维埃文学将来的思想领导者，所以党应当以一切方法与那些对旧文化遗产和文艺专门家的轻率和蔑视的态度作斗争。同样地，过低估计为无产阶级作家的思想领导权而斗争的重要性的立场，也是应该斥责的。一方面反对投降，另一方面反对摆共产党员架子，——这应当是党的口号。党也应当与纯粹在暖房里培植“无产阶级”文学的尝试作斗争。广泛把握极其复杂的现象，不关闭在一个工厂范围内，不作车间的文学而要作领导千百万农民的伟大战斗阶级的文学，——这就是无产阶级文学内容的范围。
    十二、作为党手中主要教育工具之一的批评的任务，就一般和整个讲来，是由上述的情况来决定。一刻也不放弃共产主义的立场，丝毫也不违反无产阶级的思想，而且揭示各种文学作品的客观的阶级意义，共产主义批评应当与文学中反革命的现象作无情的斗争，暴露路标转换派的自由主义等等，同时还要对于一切能同无产阶级一道前进而且会同无产阶级一道前进的文学阶层表示最大的周到、慎重和忍耐。共产主义批评应当在文学上避免使用命令的语气。这种批评只有以自己思想的优越性为依靠的时候，才能具有深刻的教育意义。马克思主义批评应当从自己中间驱除狂妄的、半通的和神气十足的共产党员架子。马克思主义批评应当给自己提出“学习”这个口号，并且应当打击自己中间的一切废话和胡说。
    十三、正确地认清了各种文学流派的社会阶级内容，党一般地决不能把自己束缚于拥护文学形式方面的某个倾向。既然领导着整个文学，党就不能支持某一文学派别（依据对形式和风格的观点的不同而划分这些派别），正如党不能以决议来解决家庭形式问题，虽然一般讲来它无疑地领导着而且应当领导新生活的建设。一切都迫使这样地设想：与时代相适应的风格将被创造出来，但是将以其他各种方法创造出来，而这个问题的解决则还没有开始。在我国文化发展的现阶段上，任何在这方面把党束缚起来的企图，都应当加以驳斥。
    十四、因此，党应当主张这个领域中的各种集团和派别自由竞赛。用任何旁的方法来解决这个问题，都不免是衙门官僚式的假解决。以指令或党的决议使某一集团或文学组织对文学出版事业实行合法的独占，同样也是不容许的。党虽然在物质上和精神上支持无产阶级文学和无产阶级农民文学、帮助“同路人”等等，却不能听任即使在思想内容上最为无产阶级的任何集团实行独占，因为这首先就会毁灭无产阶级文学。
    十五、党应当用一切办法根除对文学事业的专横的和不胜任的行政干涉的尝试。党应当仔细注意出版事业机关的人选，以便保证对我们文学的真正正确的、有益的和有分寸的领导。
    十六、党应当向一切文艺工作者指出正确划分批评家和文艺作家的职能之必要。对于后者，必须把自己工作的重心转移到真正意义下的文学作品上，而且利用现代庞大的材料。我们联盟中许多共和国和省的民族文学的发展，也必须加强注意。
    党应当强调必须创造给真正广大的读者、工人和农民读者所阅读的文艺。应该更大胆和坚决地打破文学上的贵族偏见，并且在利用旧技巧的一切成就时，要创造出千百万人所能理解的适当形式。
    只有解决了这个伟大的任务，苏维埃文学及其将来的无产阶级先锋队才能完成自己的文化历史使命。
    （注）路标转换派是一九一二年在国外的俄国资产阶级流亡者中间产生的一个资产阶级政派，它以一种叫做“路标转换”的杂志得名。路标转换派是苏俄新资产阶级及资产阶级知识分子观点的反映，他们由于新经济政策的实行而放弃了用公开的武装斗争来反对苏维埃政权，指望着苏维埃制度逐渐蜕化为普通的资产阶级共和国。——译者
