　　Recollections of the Past Two Years
    Zhao Guoyou
    Today is the second great New Year's Day festival since the founding of New China. We are all vigorously commemorating this festival by resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country, and engaging in patriotic production competitions. On this festival, I am extremely happy! Looking back over the past two years, the motherland's industry has begun to recover and develop. Our workers have also begun to live happy lives with the recovery and development of production. The so-called "stinky workers" who were not valued in the old society have shed their slave status and become the masters of New China. In the past, countless working people were "blind and illiterate." Now, under the care and cultivation of the Communist Party, many workers are attending universities, not only able to read newspapers but also able to write.
    Thinking of the past, I am truly ashamed. When Shenyang was first liberated, I was still semi-literate, with a muddled mind. I remember very clearly that when Shenyang was first liberated in the winter of 1948, I still didn't trust my own government. The government told us very clearly: "Today, workers are the masters of the country," but at the time we were very confused, thinking: what master or not, workers have been slaves since ancient times. No matter who comes, it's just changing the soup but not the medicine. When the Kuomintang first came, they also talked about democracy, but as a result, they caused our workers to lose their families and die. Anyway, it's just working, earning money, and eating. Work was still the same old way: dragging our feet, and slacking off. A month after the liberation, the Party transferred me to the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Workers' Training Class for study. After forty-five days of studying the history of social development, the history of the Party, etc., my muddled brain turned around. I recognized that the Chinese Communist Party is our own party, the People's Government is our own government, and they are truly serving the people. At the same time, I also recognized that workers are the masters of the country. However, I didn't get rid of all the bad habits that the old society had given me all at once. After returning to the factory, I only knew how to bury myself in hard work and didn't know how to unite my brothers to move forward together. This was very obvious when creating new records. At that time, my phenomenon of being detached from the masses was very serious. I relied on the Party to get a good correction. The Party constantly educated me, saying: "It is right for you to bury yourself in hard work, but you must also humbly learn from the older workers and technicians, improve your political, cultural, and technical level, and help other workers." At the same time, the Party gave me an example: "For example, if a locomotive runs very fast, but forgets to bring the carriages, then it's useless no matter how fast it runs; you have to attach more carriages, load more goods, and run fast, so that it can play the role of a locomotive!" Later, I followed this bright road, and everyone saw that I was humbly learning from the masses; people naturally approached me, and gradually my relationship with comrades became closer. When others' work improved, my own work also greatly improved. In September 1949, in the upsurge of creating new records, I reduced the tower wheel record from two hours and twenty minutes to one hour and sixteen minutes. At this time, I thought, if I hadn't received the Party's training and education, which enabled me to unite the masses, I wouldn't have achieved any work results. It's like a fish leaving water. After I realized this principle, I worked even harder, striving to join the ranks of the Party. After three or four requests, I became a glorious Communist Party member on November 15, 1949. Under the Party's training and education, my political, cultural, and technical aspects gradually improved, and I was able to write articles in the newspaper frequently. In December, I shortened the new record of one hour and sixteen minutes for the tower wheel to fifty minutes. But the shortcomings and bad habits that the old society left me haven't been completely removed, and I believe that under the leadership and education of our Party and government, I will make progress quickly. On April 24, 1950, under the cultivation of the Party, I got the most valuable opportunity to visit Leningrad in the Soviet Union. The most profound impressions it left on me, many moving things are still clearly remembered in my heart. I will never forget the spirit of the Soviet people under the leadership and education of the All-Union Communist Party, overcoming difficulties, and fighting bravely for the freedom of the motherland. Leningrad was besieged by German fascists for nine hundred days during the war. More than one million shells and bombs fell on the entire city. Especially the Leningrad shoe factory, which was only fifteen kilometers away from the front line, every workshop was hit by shells and bombs, and no workshop was intact. Before the war, there were more than eleven thousand workers there, and during the war, only two hundred workers remained. They insisted on production under the shelling and bombing, without stopping work for a single day. Workers only ate half a catty of bread a day, and in emergencies, they couldn't eat for several days. Even so, they were still enthusiastically engaged in socialist production competitions and won two award banners. At the most urgent moment, most of the workers automatically took up arms and ran to the front line to kill the enemy. As a result, the Soviet Red Army attacked Berlin, and victory belonged to the Soviet people. Now, the Leningrad shoe factory has not only been restored, but also added many new workshops, and each person produces an average of twelve pairs of shoes a day.
    This is something that our workers couldn't even dream of in the past: under the Party's cultivation and the support of comrades, I attended the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a nonvoting delegate. What made me the happiest, and also what made all the workers the happiest, was that we met Chairman Mao the day before the meeting! When Chairman Mao shook my hand tightly, I felt an indescribable joy in my heart. At the same time, seeing Chairman Mao's humble and simple style, his love for us workers, and his concern for our workers' work, study, and life, I couldn't wait to tell all the worker brothers about these situations. On the closing day, Chairman Mao took pictures with us worker and peasant representatives, signed autographs in his own handwriting, and toasted with us at the banquet, while telling us to unite the working class! On the eve of the first National Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, at the National Congress of Worker, Peasant, and Soldier Labor Representatives, Chairman Mao shook my hand tightly again as before and said: "Hey, you're here again!..."
    Finally, on the New Year's Day festival of 1951, I extend my most sincere respect to Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army! I extend my warm greetings and high respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea! And wish them victory after victory, advance after advance, until the American imperialist aggressors are driven into the sea.

　　两年来的回想
    赵国有
    今天是新中国成立后第二个伟大的元旦节日，我们大家都正在抗美援朝保家卫国，搞爱国主义生产竞赛，朝气蓬勃地来纪念这一节日。在这个节日，我高兴极啦！回想两年来，祖国的工业开始恢复和发展。我们工人也随着生产的恢复和发展开始过幸福的生活。旧社会里不被人所重视的所谓“臭工人”已经脱去奴隶地位，变成新中国的主人翁。过去无数劳动人民都当了“白眼瞎”，不识字。如今在共产党的爱护、培养下，很多工人上大学，不仅能看报纸，还能写作了。
    我想起过去，实在惭愧。在沈阳刚解放时，我还是个半文盲，满脑子的糊涂思想。我还记得很清楚，一九四八年冬沈阳刚解放时，对自己政府还不相信。政府告诉我们很清楚：“今天工人是国家主人翁”，但是我们当时很糊涂，心想：什么主人不主人的，工人自古以来就是当奴隶，不论谁来，都是换汤不换药，国民党刚来的时候也是要讲民主，结果，害我们工人家破人亡。反正是干活、挣钱、吃饭。工作还是老一套，磨洋工、泡磨菇。解放一个月后，党调我到沈阳市总工会职工训练班学习，经过四十五天，学习了社会发展史、党史等，才把糊涂脑瓜转过来。认清了中国共产党是我们自己的党，人民政府是我们自己的政府，是真为了人民服务的。同时也认识了工人是国家主人翁。但是，我没有把旧社会所给我的毛病都一齐去掉，回到工厂后，光知道埋头苦干，不知道如何团结自己弟兄一齐前进。创造新纪录时就很显著，当时自己脱离群众的现象很严重，我依靠了党，才得到很好的改正。党不断教育我说：“你埋头苦干是对的，但你还得虚心向老年工人和技术人员学习，提高政治、文化、技术水平，帮助其他工人。”同时党给我举出例子：“比方火车头跑的非常快，结果忘掉带车皮，这样跑的再快也没用；要多挂车皮，多装货，跑的也快，这样才能起火车头的作用！”以后，我依着这条光明大路走，大家看我虚心向群众学习；人们也就自然接近我，渐渐地和同志们的关系也密切起来。别人工作提高，我自己的工作也大大得到进步。一九四九年九月份，在创新纪录热潮中，我把二小时二十分钟塔轮的纪录降低到了一小时十六分钟。这时我就想，我不是得到党的培养教育，使我能够团结群众，是不会得到任何工作成绩的。这就像鱼离开水一样。我认识这个道理以后，就更加努力地工作，争取参加到党的队伍里来。经过三、四次的要求，结果在一九四九年十一月十五日，我成为光荣的共产党员了。在党的培养教育下，使我政治文化技术各方面渐渐进步了，经常能在报上写稿子了。十二月份，又把一小时十六分钟塔轮新纪录缩短到五十分钟。但旧社会留给我的缺点和毛病，还没能全部去掉，我相信在我们的党及政府领导教育下，会很快地进步。一九五○年四月二十四日，在党的培养下，得到最宝贵的机会，曾到苏联列宁格勒参观。给我留下最深刻的印象，许多动人的事情还清清楚楚记在心里。我永远不会忘记苏联人民在联共党的领导教育下，克服困难，为祖国的自由而英勇奋斗的精神。列宁格勒在战争时期曾遭受德国法西斯包围了九百天。全城落了一百多万发炮弹和炸弹。尤其是列宁格勒皮鞋工厂，只离战线十五公里，每个场房都落了炮弹和炸弹，场房没有一个完整的，在战前那里有一万一千多工人，战争时只剩下二百多工人，他们还在炮火轰炸之下坚持生产，一天没停过工。工人每天只吃半斤面包，情况紧急时几天吃不到饭，就这样还轰轰烈烈搞社会主义生产竞赛，获得两面奖旗。最紧急的时候，大多数工人都自动拿起武器，跑到前线去杀敌人。结果苏联红军攻到柏林，胜利是属于苏联人民的。现在列宁格勒皮鞋工厂不但都已恢复起来，而且添了很多新式车间，每天每人平均一天出产十二双皮鞋。
    这是我们工人过去连作梦也想不到的事情：在我们党的培养下和同志们拥护下，我列席了中国人民政协全国委员会第二次会议。使我最高兴的、也是所有工人最高兴的，开会前一天我们见到毛主席啦！当毛主席和我紧紧握手的时候，我心里说不出来的高兴。同时，见到毛主席那样谦虚朴素的作风，那样热爱我们工人，那样关心我们工人的工作、学习和生活，急得我恨不当时把这些情形叫所有工人弟兄都知道。在闭幕那一天，毛主席和我们工农代表在一起照像，亲笔给签字，宴会上又和我们碰杯，同时告诉我们工人阶级团结起来！在中华人民共和国成立后的第一个国庆日前夕，全国工农兵劳动代表会议上，毛主席又和前次同样地紧紧握着我的手说：“喂，你又来啦！……”
    最后，在一九五一年的元旦节日，我向毛主席、中国共产党、人民解放军致以最真挚的敬礼！向在抗美援朝最前线的中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军致以热烈的慰问和崇高的敬礼！并祝胜利再胜利，前进再前进，直到把美帝侵略者赶到海里去。
