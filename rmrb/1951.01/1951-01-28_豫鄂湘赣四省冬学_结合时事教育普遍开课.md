Xinhua News Agency Report:

Winter literacy campaigns in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces have universally begun, integrating current affairs education related to resisting America and aiding Korea.

Last spring, the aforementioned four provinces established over 12,000 winter literacy schools, literacy classes, and spare-time schools for the people, enrolling 550,000 farmers. In Henan Province alone, over 85,000 farmers persisted in year-round study. Most enrolled farmers have learned several hundred characters, with some even learning to write letters and do basic accounting. Farmers learned about policies such as opposing local bullies, rent reduction, and land reform in the winter literacy campaigns, universally raising their political awareness.

This year, in areas where land reform has been completed, farmers have an even more pressing need to improve their cultural level. In the 43 counties of Henan Province where land reform has been completed, farmers are enthusiastically participating in the winter literacy campaign under the slogan "After overthrowing oppression, transform your mind; literacy changes your brain." Farmers in Xuchang and Lushan counties, where land reform was completed earlier, are especially eager to enroll. This year, approximately 850,000 male and female farmers throughout the province are participating in winter literacy study. In Hubei Province, where the campaigns to oppose local bullies, reduce rent, and carry out land reform are underway, approximately 150,000 people have enrolled. In Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, village cadres, Youth League members, and militiamen are actively attending winter literacy schools, becoming the backbone of learning.

Prior to the opening of the winter literacy schools, many areas established winter literacy committees to strengthen leadership over the schools. Various regions in Henan Province also held a large number of winter literacy teacher training classes, with over 5,500 teachers participating in the training. This year, winter literacy schools in various locations are combining current affairs education related to resisting America and aiding Korea with cultural classes in their teaching. Teachers read newspapers, explain current events, and answer questions for students participating in the winter literacy campaign. Some even compile current affairs issues into cultural textbooks, teaching students to read while explaining current events, which is very popular with farmers.

　　豫鄂湘赣四省冬学
    结合时事教育普遍开课
    【新华社讯】河南、湖北、湖南、江西等四省的冬学，在结合抗美援朝的时事教育中，已普遍开学。
    上述四省在去春开设冬学、识字班、业余民校等一万二千余处，入学农民达五十五万人，其中仅河南省即有八万五千多农民坚持了常年学习。入学农民大都认识了几百个字，部分农民且学会了写信、算账。农民们在冬学中学习了反恶霸、减租及土地改革等政策，普遍地提高了政治觉悟。
    今年土地改革已完成的地区，农民们对提高文化的要求更为迫切。河南省已完成土地改革的四十三个县，农民们在“翻身要翻心，识字换脑筋”的口号下，热烈地参加冬学。土地改革完成较早的许昌、鲁山等县农民入学尤其踊跃。今年全省参加冬学学习的男女农民约达八十五万人以上。正在进行反恶霸、减租和土地改革的湖北省也约有十五万人入学。湖南、江西各地冬学中，村干部、青年团员、民兵都积极上学，成为学习中的骨干。
    在开办冬学之先，不少地区成立了冬学委员会，加强对冬学的领导。河南省各地并大量举办冬学教师训练班，参加受训的教师有五千五百多人。今年各地冬学都是以抗美援朝的时事教育和文化课结合着进行教学的。教师们向参加冬学的学生读报、讲解时事、解答问题；有的并把时事问题编成文化课本，一边教学生识字，一边向学生讲解时事，很受农民欢迎。
