Nanjing University of Nanking's Accusation Against U.S. Imperialism
    Baisheng

    The entire history of Nanjing University of Nanking, founded in 1888, is closely linked to the history of U.S. imperialist aggression against China.

    In 1858, U.S. imperialism took advantage of the Anglo-French allied forces' attack on Tianjin to force the Qing government to sign the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Tianjin, which stipulated that American missionaries had the right to preach freely in the Chinese interior. From then on, the agents of U.S. imperialism, disguised as missionaries, came to the Chinese interior in batches to establish churches and found missionary schools. In 1888, the American Methodist Episcopal Church's Fu Luo founded "Huiwen Academy" in Nanjing, with the American aggressor Ferguson as its first president. Later, U.S. imperialism established "Hongyu Academy" in Nanjing. In 1907, Huiwen and Hongyu merged and were named Nanjing University.

    From the very beginning, Nanjing University exposed the ferocious faces of American rogue bandits. The magnificent school buildings of Nanjing University were built with the blood and tears of the Chinese people. The 2,340 mu of campus land of Nanjing University were all ancestral graves and residences of nearby residents, which were seized by American bandits through deception and coercion. In the old archives of Nanjing University, there are two pieces of evidence. One is called "The Complete Account of the Negotiations Between the Jianzhong Association and Huiwen Academy," which details how U.S. imperialism unreasonably seized 615 square bases of the Jianzhong Association, how the two sides fought a lawsuit, and how U.S. imperialism bribed the members of the Jianzhong Association and occupied this land for nothing. Another material is a letter from the Xin'an Jiahui Hall to an American professor demanding the return of land, which stated that American bandits had seized a piece of their graveyard. This graveyard was purchased by Jiahui Hall during the "Qianlong era of the previous Qing Dynasty and is now nearly a hundred years old," and there are title deeds to prove it. However, the bandits argued that the graveyard was theirs and brazenly "built sheds and engaged in excavation, and workers said that many coffins have been dug out," "Such infringement of land rights and damage to the bones of the dead will inevitably disappoint the local people." But no matter how angry and protested the Chinese people, U.S. imperialism still occupied these more than 2,000 mu of land, excavated the ancestral graves of the Chinese people, built the school buildings of Nanjing University, and called it American property, and asked the Nanjing University accounting office to pay one U.S. dollar a year as rent, as a symbol of American property rights.

    This university, founded by American bandits, established a complete colonial education system. All the courses explained for whom it was training talents. New students had to fill out forms in English upon admission. All experiments, reports, reference books, transcripts, and school announcements and speeches were in English. Even when workers bought things outside the school, the Chinese invoices they brought back had to be translated into English before they could be reimbursed. The history in the Nanjing University curriculum was American history, the literature was American literature, and the rural economy was the American rural economy. Nanjing University had been running for decades, and after countless efforts by the Chinese people, the Department of Chinese Literature was established in 1924, but it was always an ornament and was not valued, and the treatment of Chinese professors was also lower than that of other professors. The course "General History of China" was not available until after 1925. In front of the teachers and students of Nanjing University, only the road to the United States was the "main road," and as long as you went to the United States to gild yourself, you would "be worth a hundred times," otherwise you would never have a chance to stand out. Some female students at Nanjing University learned American-style lipstick, flower arrangement, and American-style sleeping positions. In short, everything American was "good." Under this education system, some deceived students even blamed themselves for not being Chinese and for being born in China. This is the "friendship" that Austin spoke of between the United States and the Chinese people!

    After the State Council promulgated the "Decision on Handling Cultural and Educational Institutions and Religious Organizations Accepting U.S. Subsidies," all 32 study groups of Nanjing University immediately launched enthusiastic study and informal discussions. First, they related to the facts of U.S. cultural aggression, and then related to U.S. imperialist aggression in Nanjing University. After this serious root-digging and poison-sweeping movement, Nanjing University dug out the poisonous roots growing in its own school.

    According to the disclosure of Mr. Dai Longsun, a staff member of the Office of the Dean of the Agricultural College of Nanjing University, Ferguson, the first president of Nanjing University, came to China in 1887, disguised as "promoting culture," and secretly informed the Qing government of the revolutionary party members—Zou Rong from Baxian, Sichuan, Zhang Binglin from Yuhang, Zhejiang, and four others. Except for Zhang Binglin, who fled to Japan, the other five were martyred. At that time, Ferguson also sent a telegram to Duanfang, a Qing Dynasty slave: "Junjian, the governor of Wuchang: The secret Su Bao is rebellious and the revolution is rampant. I have tried to negotiate with the American consul in Shanghai, and the consuls have signed and approved it. The Public Works Bureau immediately agreed to take action. Five of the six people have been arrested, including the editor-in-chief of Su Bao. After interrogation, they will be transferred. The remaining party's case will be reported later, and the situation is being reviewed. Kaishen." Ferguson "made great contributions" for killing revolutionary party members. During the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing government appointed him as a member to revise treaties with the United States and Japan. Later, he was also respected as a guest by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. This is the "glorious achievement" of the first American president of Nanjing University in "promoting culture."

    In order to further "promote culture," the American presidents of the school successively hired many so-called American "experts" and "professors." From the accusations of Mr. Ge Fuding, professor of the Department of Agricultural Economics of the school, Mr. Cao Guoqing, director of the Department of Economics, and Mr. Cui Yujun, professor of the Department of Agricultural Economics, we can see how these "experts" and "professors" openly committed intolerable crimes in this school. Professor Ge Fuding pointed out that Buck (American), the first director of the Department of Agricultural Economics, and Lewis (American), professor of the Department of Agricultural Economics, were spies sent by U.S. imperialism to China. Buck came to China in 1921, and he used the department's students' summer homework to investigate Chinese land and population. He and his ex-wife, the infamous Pearl Buck, jointly stole the research results of Chinese students. He wrote a book called "Chinese Farm Economy" and used it as his capital to return to the United States and re-enter Cornell University. He used the materials of Chinese students to obtain a "doctorate," and then he came back to China with the guise of a "doctor." His wife, Pearl Buck, also shared the materials stolen by her husband, and with shameless distortion, wrote a novel that insulted the Chinese people, "The Good Earth," and Pearl Buck became famous because of this. She became acquainted with the big capitalists in the American publishing industry and hooked up with them and got married. When Buck came to China for the second time, he was ordered by the Wall Street boss, the oil tycoon Rockefeller, to collect information on China's agricultural economy. Rockefeller took out $15,000 a year from his Rockefeller Foundation and entrusted the Pacific International Institute to be responsible for Buck's investigation of Chinese land. So Buck used the graduates of the Department of Agricultural Economics of Nanjing University to carry out this work. At that time, Professor Cui Yujun graduated from the Department of Agricultural Economics and was sent to Yunnan by Buck to conduct land surveys. Professor Cui was extremely angry when he accused this matter. The investigation lasted for five years. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang also helped the American Wall Street boss to complete this investigation task and allowed Buck to take aerial photography to seize our national defense secrets, and stole the source maps of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in China, in order to realize its "planned" and "systematic" investigation conspiracy. Because of Buck's "great achievements" in plundering the Chinese economy, the U.S. authorities sent him to be the U.S. Treasury Department's representative in China at that time to further openly plunder the wealth of the Chinese people.

    Another Lewis, who also had "great achievements" like Buck, colluded with the Kuomintang reactionary government in the name of professor of agricultural economics, and asked students to do silver price surveys, and made a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between silver prices and commodity prices in various parts of China. Professor Cao Guoqing accused that at that time, from 1933 to 1934, because the price of silver was low in the world market, U.S. imperialism raised the price of silver and purchased silver in order to take care of the interests of the big capitalists who owned Mexican silver mines. Lewis's report helped U.S. imperialism to set off a violent silver boom, sucking up China's wealth and creating favorable conditions for the "Sino-U.S. Silver Agreement" signed by U.S. imperialism in 1936 in order to carry out large-scale economic plunder of our country. With the help of Lewis's silver price survey, U.S. imperialism openly and shamelessly seized a total of about 140 million taels of Chinese silver in two times!

    In the year before the War of Resistance Against Japan, U.S. imperialism sent Bedes, a pawn of the American financial magnate Morgan, to Nanjing University to teach history, but in fact, he was carrying out vicious espionage activities. Bedes colluded with the Japanese invaders and Wang Jingwei and participated in the Nanjing Massacre at that time. On the one hand, he spread pro-Japanese ideas to the students at Nanjing University, and on the other hand, he colluded with the Japanese invaders and handed over a large number of Chinese refugees to the Japanese invaders under the name of "recruiting people to work," allowing the Japanese invaders to massacre them collectively. In 1945, Bedes stole the military maps used by the Japanese invaders when they invaded our country, which clearly shows that U.S. imperialism wanted to follow the old path of Japanese imperialist aggression!

    Jin Zizhong, dean of the Agricultural College of Nanjing University, also angrily exposed the crimes of the former American professor of the Department of Botany, Stewe, who transported the Chinese plant specimens and tung tree seeds collected by the students with blood and sweat to the United States to sell for money, and transported the tung tree seeds to the United States to plant in order to seize China's tung oil market. He also insulted the Chinese people, saying, "You don't know how to preserve specimens yet, I'll take them to the United States for you to preserve." He shamelessly stole Chinese specimens and falsely accused Tang Yi, a Chinese staff member who had worked at Nanjing University for more than 20 years, and dismissed Tang, who died of anger.

    Today, when the teachers, students and staff of Nanjing University thoroughly recognize the crimes of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression and unanimously accuse and reject U.S. subsidies, U.S. imperialism is making every effort to carry out conspiracies. On December 16 last year, through its agent, the chief accountant Billows, it tried to turn the "subsidies" into pounds and remit them from India in an attempt to change its appearance and continue to carry out its cultural aggression conspiracy.

    But the Chinese people have finally stood up, and all the faculty and staff of Nanjing University have also stood up. In the past 63 years, Nanjing University has produced many patriotic teachers and students who have waged various struggles against U.S. imperialism. For example, the people's educator Mr. Tao Xingzhi was "expelled" from the school for fighting against U.S. imperialist elements. Today, all the teachers, students and staff of Nanjing University are roaring. At the conference of higher education institutions subsidized by foreign countries held by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, we excitedly heard the angry voice of Mr. Li Fangxun, the acting president of Nanjing University, accusing U.S. imperialist cultural aggression. Nanjing University has returned to the embrace of the motherland! Any conspiracy of U.S. imperialism is useless. Nanjing University will finally, thoroughly, and completely eliminate the influence of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression in Nanjing University and build a new Nanjing University of the people!

　　南京金陵大学对美帝的控诉
    柏生
    一八八八年创办的南京金陵大学的全部历史，都是与美帝国主义侵华历史紧密地联系着的。
    一八五八年，美帝利用英法联军攻打天津，强迫满清政府签订了中美天津条约，规定美国传教士有在中国内地自由传教的权利。从此美帝的代办们便披着传教士的外衣，一批一批来到我国内地，设立教堂，创办教会学校。在一八八八年，美国基督教的美以美会傅罗在南京创立了“汇文书院”，由美国侵略分子福开森任首任院长。以后美帝又在南京建立了“宏育书院”。一九○七年，汇文、宏育合并，名为金陵大学。
    金陵大学从开始创办起，就暴露了美国流氓强盗的凶恶面孔。金大巍峨壮丽的校舍，就是用中国人民的血泪造成的。金大二千三百四十亩的校舍基地，全部都是附近居民的祖坟和住宅，是美国强盗用欺骗强夺的手段把它霸占下来的。在金大的旧档案中，有两份材料可以做证据。有一份叫做“荐忠会与汇文书院交涉始末记”，详细记载着美帝如何无理强占荐忠会的六百十五方基地，双方如何打官司，结果美帝贿买了荐忠会的会员，白白地侵占了这块土地。还有一个材料是新安嘉会堂寄给美国教授索还土地的信，这封信里写着美国强盗强占了他们的一块坟地。这块坟地是嘉会堂在“前清嘉庆年间购置，于今将有百年”，并且还有契据为证。但强盗们狡赖说这块坟地是他们的，就蛮横地在这里“搭盖蓬架，从事发掘，据工人云已挖出棺木多具”，“似此侵人地权，损人枯骨，未免使地方人民失望”。但尽管中国人民怎样愤怒和抗议，美帝依然霸占了这二千多亩基地，挖掘了中国人民的祖坟，建筑起金大的校舍，并且把这叫做美国的财产，并要金大会计处每年纳交一元美金作租金，作为美国产权的标志。
    这个由美国强盗创立的大学，建立了一整套殖民地的教育制度。全部课程都说明了它是为谁培养人才的。新生入学填表，就要用英文。所有的实验、报告、参考书、成绩单以及学校的布告、演讲等，都用英文。甚至工友到校外买东西时拿回来的中文发票，也要翻成英文，才能报销。金大课程中的历史，是美国历史，文学是美国文学，农村经济是美国的农村经济。金大办了几十年，经过中国人的无数次争取，到一九二四年才有了中国文学系，但始终是一个点缀品，得不到重视，国文教授的待遇也比其他教授低。《中国通史》课程，也是到一九二五年以后才有的。在金大师生面前，只有通向美国的路才是“大路”，只要你到美国去镀一下金，回来就“身价百倍”，否则永远没有出头的一日。金大的一些女同学，学美国式的涂口红、插花、和美国式的睡觉姿式。总之，一切都是美国的“好”。在这种教育制度下，有些被蒙蔽的同学，甚至怪自己不该是中国人，不该生在中国。这就是奥斯汀所说的美国对中国人民的“友谊”！
    当政务院公布《关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育机关及宗教团体的方针决定》后，金大全校三十二个学习小组立即展开了热烈的学习和漫谈。首先联系到美帝文化的侵略事实，于是联系到美帝在金大的侵略行为。经过这次认真的挖根扫毒运动，金大把生长在自己学校里的毒根都挖出来了。
    据金大农学院院长办公室职员戴龙孙先生的揭露：金大首任校长美国流氓特务福开森在一八八七年来到中国，披着“促进文化”的外衣，向满清政府密告革命党人——四川巴县邹容、浙江余杭章炳麟等六人。其中除章炳麟一人逃亡日本外，其余五人均殉难。福开森当时并给满清奴才端方打了电报：“武昌兼督端制台钧鉴：秘密苏报悖逆，革命猖狂，已设法由沪道商美领事，会同各领事签押，工部局即允拿办，六人中现拿五人，苏报馆主笔在内，俟讯定即发转，余党案情后达，刻正审度机宜。开森。场。”福开森因杀害革命党人“立了大功”，在义和团事变时，满清政府派他为委员，与美日修订条约。后来又被蒋匪尊为上宾。这就是金大首任美国校长的“促进文化”的“辉煌功迹”。
    为了更进一步的“促进文化”，该校美国校长先后聘来了许多所谓美国的“专家”和“教授”。从该校农经系教授戈福鼎先生、经济系主任曹国卿先生、农经系教授崔毓俊先生等的控诉中，我们可以看到这些“专家”、“教授”是怎样在这座学府中公然干出令人难以容忍的罪恶事实来。戈福鼎教授指出首任农经系主任卜凯（美籍）及农经系教授路易士（美籍）是美帝派到中国的间谍。卜凯是一九二一年来到中国，他利用该系学生暑期作业进行调查中国土地及人口。他和他的前妻——臭名远扬的赛珍珠共同盗窃了中国学生的调查成果，他自己写成了《中国农家经济》一书，把这当成他的资本，返回美国重进康乃尔大学。他利用中国学生的材料，获得“博士学位”，于是又披着“博士”的外衣重来中国。而他的太太赛珍珠也分得了他丈夫偷来的材料，以无耻的歪曲，写成了一本侮辱中国人民的小说《大地》，赛珍珠就因此出了名。她因此认识了美国出版界的大资本家，并与大资本家勾搭上，结了婚。卜凯第二次来到中国时，受了华尔街老板，煤油大王洛克菲勒之命，收集我国农业经济情况，洛克菲勒并从他的洛氏基金中每年拿出一万五千美金，委托太平洋国际学会负责叫卜凯作中国土地的调查。于是卜凯就利用了金大农经系毕业同学进行这项工作。当时崔毓俊教授毕业于农经系，就是被卜凯派到云南进行土地调查的。崔教授控诉到这件事情时异常的愤怒。就这样调查达五年之久。蒋介石匪帮也帮助美国华尔街老板来完成这项调查任务，竟允许卜凯从空中摄影，攫取我国防机密，将中国黄河、长江的发源图等都偷摄了，以实现其有“计划”有“系统”的调查阴谋。而美国当局因为卜凯掠夺中国经济的“伟功”，便派他做了当时美国财政部驻华代表，进一步进行公开掠夺中国人民财富的勾当。
    另一个和卜凯同样有“伟功”的路易士，也以农经系教授之名，与国民党反动政府勾结，要学生做银价调查，把中国各地白银价格和物价的关系做了全面的了解。曹国卿教授控诉说：那时是一九三三年至一九三四年，因银子在世界市场价格低落，美帝为了照顾拥有墨西哥银矿的大资本家的利益，就把白银价格提高，收购白银。路易士的报告帮助美帝掀起白银的暴烈涨风，将中国财富吸尽，造成一九三六年美帝为了对我国大举进行经济掠夺而签订的《中美白银协定》的有利条件。美帝由于路易士的银价调查的帮助，先后两次公开无耻的攫取中国白银共约一万四千万两！
    在抗战前一年，美帝更派遣美国财阀摩根的一个爪牙贝德士到金大教授历史，实际上是进行毒辣的特务活动。贝德士与日寇和汪精卫勾通，参与了当时南京的大屠杀。他一面在金大向同学们传布亲日思想，一面和日寇串通，在“招人做工”的名义下，把大批的中国难民移交给日寇，让日寇集体屠杀了。一九四五年贝德士又盗窃了日寇侵略我国时用的军用地图，这明显的说明了美帝要走日本帝国主义的侵略老路！
    金大农学院院长靳自重也愤怒地揭露了前植物系美籍教授史德蔚的罪行，他把同学们用血汗努力采集来的中国植物标本，和桐树种子等运往美国卖钱，并把桐树种子运到美国种植，以便夺取中国的桐油市场。他还侮辱中国人说：“你们现在还不会保存标本，我替你们带到美国去保存”。他无耻地偷盗了中国标本，还诬赖了一位在金大工作二十多年的中国职员唐义，把唐解职，唐义活活气死了。
    今天，当金大全校师生员工彻底地认识了美帝的文化侵略罪恶，一致控诉而且拒绝美帝的津贴时，美帝更千方百计进行阴谋活动，于去年十二月十六日，通过代理人毕律斯会计主任，想把“津贴”变成英镑，由印度方面汇来，以图改头换面，继续实行它的文化侵略阴谋。
    但中国人民究竟是站立起来了，金大的全体教职员工也都站立起来了。金大六十三年来曾涌现了不少爱国师生，与美帝进行各种斗争，如人民教育家陶行知先生就是因为与美帝分子进行斗争而被“开除”出校的。今天，金大全体师生员工都怒吼起来了。在中央人民政府教育部召开的处理外国津贴的高等学校会议上，我们兴奋地听到了金大代理校长李方训先生控诉美帝文化侵略的愤怒的声音。金大从此回到祖国的怀抱里来了！美帝的任何阴谋诡计都没有用处了。金大要最后地、彻底地、完全地肃清美帝在金大进行的文化侵略的影响，建设人民的新金大！
