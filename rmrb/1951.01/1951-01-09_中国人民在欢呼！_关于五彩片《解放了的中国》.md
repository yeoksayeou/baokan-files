　　The Chinese People Are Cheering!
    --On the Color Film "Liberated China"
    By Gelaximofu, translated by Yan Meng

    Editor's Note: The author of this article, Gelaximofu, is a famous Soviet director. "Liberated China" is directed and produced by him. Comrade Xiao San had an article on the third page of this newspaper on December 25th last year introducing him.

    The image of the new China cannot but attract people's attention. The enemies of freedom and democracy hate it; while among progressive people, it arouses deep sympathy and respect for the heroic Chinese people.
    The content design of the film "Liberated China" was completed through the joint efforts of cultural workers from both the Soviet Union and China. The production of this film presented us with numerous difficulties. First, we had to measure and study a great deal of material in a short period of time. It was only with the enthusiastic help of comrades from all parts of China that we were able to complete our work.
    Our film crew arrived in China on the historic day when the People's Republic of China was proclaimed. Obviously, these celebratory events had to be included in the film, so we could not have a definite plan when we started shooting, but only filmed everything that seemed important and interesting. In fact, everything we saw was relevant to this.
    We saw the Chinese people, the heroic Chinese Communist Party; we saw Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, famous heroes, and the leaders of the Chinese people's liberation struggle who stand at the forefront of the democratic new China today. We saw the comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people, including Sun Yat-sen's wife. We saw outstanding young Chinese men and women dedicated to the people's cause; today they are celebrating the people's victory.
    With reverence, we saw the joyous scenes of millions of Chinese people who had stood up from long-term oppression. The crowds were cheering, flags were flying, and a red sea of flags passed before us. Across the vast land, from one side to the other, echoed the pleasant songs of battle and freedom.
    Giant portraits of the leaders of the working people, Lenin and Stalin, together with portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, were held high in the hands of millions of people. They lovingly carried the portraits of Lenin and Stalin through the streets and squares of cities and villages, as a beloved battle flag, as a symbol of defeating the reactionaries, and as a solemn sign of China's future socialist construction.
    All this is only a part of the magnificent panorama unfolding before us. It is impossible to record all the joyous scenes of the liberated Chinese people.
    From October 1st, the grand occasion of the founding ceremony continued almost until the middle of the month. After the celebrations ended, people went to their posts to build the new country. They engaged in this work with their characteristic diligence.
    In order to produce a film that fully describes all of this, the Chinese Communist Party gave us extremely valuable assistance. The Central Committee of the CPC assigned many commanders as our consultants. They were the leaders of the Chinese national liberation movement in the past, directly participated in this movement, and experienced the entire heroic struggle, from the initial revolutionary struggle in 1925 to the victorious battles of liberating China and the establishment of people's power. Most of our advisors were combatants who had just taken off their military uniforms and put on the blue clothing of Chinese workers. They dedicated all their experience and knowledge to the construction of peaceful life.
    They collaborated with us to draft the film's production plan. The main difficulty in this stage was that we had to process piles of materials. Because even a very long documentary film is difficult to include them all. However, our task was: to clearly depict the main stages of the Chinese people's liberation struggle in the past century in a documentary with historical accuracy.
    We drafted four production plans before we successfully solved this problem.
    After that, our work entered another stage—on-site shooting. The photographers acted immediately. The main members of the photography team included Soviet photographic experts specializing in the production of color art documentaries: Braznov, Jinding, Giseliev, Makaseev, Petrov, Lapo Port and Havchen. The Beijing Film Studio assigned Comrades Zhou Libo, He Shide, and Xu Xiaobing to work with us.
    The shooting was done according to a detailed plan. The photographers went to various provinces to film prominent scenes of the new life that was flourishing.
    The Chinese people's struggle to establish a new way of life, a new economic system, and a new culture has now entered a new stage of peaceful construction. And the freedom they gained in battle provides possible conditions for this peaceful construction. In the southern provinces, the war to wipe out the Kuomintang remnants is still going on. The bandits are doing everything they can to retain even a small piece of territory on the Chinese mainland. However, it is obvious that the final victory of the Chinese people is certain. The massive aid of the American masters to their lackey Chiang Kai-shek's group cannot stop the great march of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army. Because the Chinese People's Liberation Army has a high degree of discipline, is well-equipped; and most importantly, it is inspired by noble revolutionary ideals, and it knows why it is fighting.
    The soldiers' high morale and strong physique give people a pleasant feeling. And the long and arduous road experienced by the People's Liberation Army gives us a deep impression. It fought all the way from Yan'an to Guangzhou. The People's Liberation Army is organized by workers, farmers, and intellectuals. War is by no means a profession for them. Every soldier, commander, and general is completely a builder, a creative worker. In the struggle to liberate the motherland's territory from foreign invaders and Kuomintang traitors, each of them did their best to help the people, to convince them of the final victory, and to help them repair what was destroyed by the war. In the intervals between battles, the glorious People's Army soldiers helped the farmers restore agricultural production.
    After liberation, the most important issue facing the Chinese people and their government is land reform. Therefore, the film pays the greatest attention to the preparation and implementation of this greatest change in the lives of the Chinese people.
    For thousands of years, the Chinese people have experienced poverty and oppression that cannot be described in writing. Only two years ago, feudalism of the Middle Ages still existed in China. Landlords had supreme power. He was the emperor of the farmers, who could execute any farmer without trial, force farmers to join the Kuomintang army, and order them to be slaves of the landlord's wives and daughters. Generally speaking, the landlord had his own armed forces - this was the pillar of his brutal rule. The Chinese people called him a "tyrant."
    But now, the power of those tyrants has finally been overthrown. We saw the public trials held in the village, in which all the villagers, from children to old men, participated. They settled accounts with the tyrants for the humiliation and oppression they had suffered for generations.
    Our photographers recorded the joyful scenes of the liberated farmers. They burned the IOUs and title deeds, which recorded the slavery, brutality and humiliation they had experienced for a long time.
    In the cities, we saw factories liberated from the oppression of foreign capital revived; we saw the buds of a new type of state-owned industry, where the labor of Chinese workers became free creative labor for the first time, no longer the slave labor of the past.
    We met the first labor heroes in China: male and female; old workers and young workers who had just entered the factory. But they have one thing in common: selfless patriotism, a high degree of revolutionary class consciousness, and loyalty to the Communist Party.
    We attended a Party branch meeting in a factory. At the meeting, two young workers were admitted to the Party. All the Party members—hundreds of people—faced the Party flag, took off their hats, raised their right hands, and followed the branch secretary to swear to the Party. Every sentence contains profound meaning, reflecting the great achievements of the vanguard of the Chinese working class, embodying the political beliefs of a Communist Party member and the ideology and moral standards that guide all his actions.
    After the branch meeting ended, I asked: Why should not only the two new Party members, but also the other Party members, repeat the oath? The branch secretary replied seriously to this question:
    "First of all, repeating these oaths will never do any harm to a Communist Party member. Secondly, when a person joins the Party, he should feel that all comrades in the Party have common ideas and bear the same responsibilities to the people."
    In China, progressive ideology is growing rapidly. We can get proof from primary and secondary schools, universities, workers' and farmers' organizations, research institutes and libraries, theaters, cinemas and concert halls, and from all aspects of life. Inspired by the Communist Party, hundreds of millions of Chinese people are moving towards progress, justice, freedom and happiness under the leadership of the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao.
    This happiness was obtained in a long and arduous struggle, and the Chinese people have understood the value of peaceful labor and sincere friendship. This explains why 200 million Chinese people signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal and why the Chinese people have strong friendly feelings towards the Soviet people—they know that the Soviet people are their first strong and reliable friend.
    Wherever we went, we felt this friendship and brotherhood. And on October 1, 1950, the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, when we brought the film "Liberated China" to Beijing for its first screening to the heads of the Chinese government and the Chinese audience, we were treated like brothers.
    Among the audiences who visited the first screening were labor heroes, who gathered in the capital to celebrate the National Day commemoration. It is surprising that the audience is also the hero in the movie—in fact, everyone in the hall is a representative in the movie. This screening clearly demonstrated the friendship between our two great nations.
    We cooperated with our Chinese comrades and friends and undertook the work of producing "Liberated China." This work is the beginning of the cooperation between two great cultures and two nations fighting at the forefront for the happiness of mankind. And this cooperation has unlimited prospects.

### 中国人民在欢呼！——关于五彩片《解放了的中国》

　　中国人民在欢呼！
    ——关于五彩片《解放了的中国》
    格拉西莫夫作  严蒙译
    编者按：本文作者格拉西莫夫是苏联名导演，《解放了的中国》就是他编导的。去年十二月二十五日本报三版上有萧三同志介绍他的文章。
    新中国的形象是不能不引起人们的注意的。自由和民主的敌人痛恨它；而在进步的人们中，它却引起了深刻的同情心及对于英勇的中国人民的崇敬。
    《解放了的中国》电影内容的设计，是在苏中两国文化工作者共同努力下完成的。这一影片的摄制，曾使我们遇到无数的困难，我们首先必须在短促的时间内，把许许多多的材料加以衡量和研究。由于中国各地同志的热情帮助，才使我们得以完成我们的工作。
    在中华人民共和国宣布成立的历史性的日子里，我们摄影队到达了中国。显然地，这些欢庆的盛况是必须收到影片中去的，因此我们在开始拍摄时不能有一定的计划，只是把看来是重要而有趣的一切拍摄下来。而实际上呢，我们所看到的都是有关这方面的材料。
    我们看见了中国人民、英勇的中国共产党；我们看见了毛主席、朱总司令、著名的英雄及今天站在民主新中国前列的中国人民解放斗争的领导者。我们看见了中国人民的战友，其中有孙中山的夫人。我们看见了献身于人民事业的优秀的中国男女青年；今天他们正在欢庆人民的胜利。
    我们带着崇敬的心情，看到了从长期压迫下站起来了的千百万中国人民欢欣鼓舞的场面。人群在欢腾，旗子在飘扬，红色的旗海从我们面前移过去了。在辽阔的国土上，从一边到那边，回响着战斗与自由的愉快歌声。
    劳动人民的领袖列宁和斯大林的巨像，与毛主席和朱总司令的像一起，高举在千百万人民的手里。他们敬爱地带着列宁和斯大林的像穿过城市和乡村的街道和广场，作为一面亲爱的战斗旗子，作为一个战胜反动派的象征，作为中国未来社会主义建设的一个庄严标志。
    所有这一切，只是展开在我们面前的伟大全景画的一部分，要把解放了的中国人民的那种欢快的镜头全部记录下来，是不可能的。
    从十月一日开始，开国大典的盛况几乎一直延续到月中。祝典结束以后，人们走上了建设新国家的岗位。他们以他们所特有的辛勤从事这个工作。
    为了摄制一部足写出所有这一切的影片，中国共产党给予我们以极为宝贵的帮助，中共中央委员会指派许多指挥员作为我们的顾问。他们过去是中国民族解放运动的领导者，曾直接参加过这个运动，经历了整个的英勇的斗争历程，从一九二五年的初期革命斗争一直到解放中国的胜利战斗与人民政权的建立。我们的顾问们大部分是战斗员，他们才脱下他们的军服，穿上了中国工人的蓝色服装。他们把自己的全部经验和知识献给和平生活的建设。
    他们协同我们草拟了影片的摄制计划。这一阶段中的主要困难，是我们必须处理成堆的材料。因为即使是一部很长的记录片，也是难于把它们都收罗进去的。然而，我们的任务是：在一部记录片里，用历史的正确性清楚地描绘出近百年来中国人民解放斗争的主要阶段。
    在我们成功地解决这一问题之前，曾草拟了四个摄制计划。
    之后，我们的工作进入了另一个阶段——实地拍摄。摄影人员即行动起来了。摄影团的主要人员，包括摄制五彩艺术记录片的苏联摄影专家：勃拉兹诺夫、金丁、吉赛里奥夫、马卡赛也夫、彼得洛夫、拉波保尔脱及哈夫琴。而北京电影制片厂则委派周立波、何士德及徐肖冰等同志和我们一起工作。
    拍摄的工作是按着一个详细的计划做的。摄影人员前往各省，实地拍摄正在蓬勃生长着的新生活的突出镜头。
    中国人民为建立一个新的生活方式、新的经济制度及新文化所进行的斗争，现在已进入了和平建设的新阶段。而他们在战斗中所获得的自由，为这个和平建设提供了可能的条件。在南方各省，扫荡国民党残敌的战争仍在进行中。匪徒们用尽一切的力量企图在中国大陆上保留即使是一小块的地盘。可是，那是很明显的，中国人民的最后胜利是肯定了的，美国主子对其奴才蒋介石集团的大量援助，决不能阻挡英勇的中国人民解放军的伟大进军。因为中国人民解放军具有着高度的纪律性，装备优良；而最重要的是，她为崇高的革命理想所鼓舞，她知道为什么而战。
    战士们士气的昂扬与体格的壮健，给予人们以愉快的感觉。而人民解放军所经历的漫长的艰苦道路，更给予我们以深刻的印象，她从延安一直战斗到广州。人民解放军是由工人、农民、及知识分子组织起来的，战争对于他们决不是一种职业。每一个战士、指挥员及将领完全是一个建设者、具有创造性的工人。在从外国入侵者及国民党卖国贼手中解放祖国领土的斗争中，他们每一个人以最大的努力帮助老百姓，使他们确信最后的胜利，并帮助他们修复被战争破坏了的东西。在战斗的空隙中，光荣的人民军战士帮助农民恢复着农业生产。
    解放以后，中国人民及其政府所面临的最重大问题乃是土地改革。因此，影片对准备和实行这一在中国人民生活的最伟大的变革给予最大的注意。
    数千年来，中国人民曾经历过非笔墨所能形容的贫穷和压迫。仅仅在两年以前，中国还存在着中世纪的封建主义。地主有着无上的权力。他是农民的太上皇，可以不经审判，处死任何一个农民，迫使农民参加国民党军队，叫他们做地主妻女的奴隶。一般地说，地主都有着自己的武装——这便是他的残暴统治的支柱。中国人民称他为“暴君”。
    可是现在，那些暴君们的权力终于被推翻了。我们见到了村子里举行的公审大会，全村的老百姓，从小孩到老汉都参加了。他们向暴君清算了世世代代所受到的凌辱与压迫。
    我们的摄影师们，把解放了的农民的兴高采烈的场面都记录下来了。他们焚毁了借据和地契，那上面记载着他们长期经历过的奴役、残暴和屈辱。
    在城市里，我们看到从外国资本的压迫下解放出来的工厂复活了；我们看到了新型的国营工业的萌芽，在这里，中国工人的劳动破天荒第一次成为自由的创造性的劳动，不再是往日的奴隶劳动了。
    我们认识了中国的第一批劳动英雄：有男的和女的；有老工人，有刚才进入工厂的青年工人。但是他们有着一个共同的特点：大公无私的爱国主义，高度的革命的阶级意识和对共产党的忠诚。
    我们曾参加了一个工厂的党支部大会。会上，两个年轻的工人被吸收入党了。全体党员——数百人——面向党旗，脱了帽子，高举右手，跟着支部书记向党宣誓。每一句话都包含着深刻的意义，反映了中国工人阶级的先锋队的伟大成就，体现了共产党员的政治信仰及指导着他的全部行动的思想意识和道德的规准。
    支部大会结束以后，我问道：为什么不仅两个新党员，而且其他的党员也要跟着念誓词呢？支部书记严肃地答复了这个问题：
    “首先，重复这些誓词对于一个共产党员是决不会有坏处的。其次，当一个人参加党的时候，应该感觉到党的全体同志和他有着共同的思想，对人民担负着同等的职责。”
    在中国，进步的思想意识正在迅速地成长。我们可以从中小学校里、大学里、工人和农民的组织里，研究院和图书馆里、剧场、电影院和音乐堂里，从生活的各个方面得到证明。为共产党所鼓舞的中国千百万人民，在中国人民领袖毛主席领导下正向着进步、正义、自由和幸福的道路前进。
    这个幸福是在长期的艰苦斗争中获得的，而且中国人民已经懂得了和平劳动及真挚友谊的可贵。这就说明了为什么二亿中国人民要在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名，为什么中国人民对苏联人民有着强烈的友好感情——他们知道苏联人民是他们的第一个强大的可靠的朋友。
    无论到那里，我们都感到了这种友谊和兄弟之情。而在一九五○年十月一日中华人民共和国周年纪念日，当我们把影片《解放了的中国》带到北京向中国政府首长及中国观众作首次放映时，我们受到了兄弟一般的款待。
    在参观首次放映的观众中，有劳动英雄，他们是集合在首都，庆祝国庆纪念节的。令人惊讶的是，观众同时即是电影中的英雄们——实际上，大厅中的每个人都是影片中的代表人物。这次放映，明显地表现了我们两大民族的友好。
    我们和我们的中国同志及朋友合作着，担负起了摄制《解放了的中国》的工作。这一工作乃是两个伟大的文化及为人类幸福战斗在最前列的两个民族合作的一个开端。而这个合作是有着无限前途的。
