　　A Model of Newspapers Combining with Practice to Promote Advanced Experience
　  —Introducing the Shenyang Daily's Report on Promoting Jiang Wanshou's Experience
    On January 10th and 12th, the Shenyang Daily prominently reported on the experience of Comrade Jiang Wanshou, an advanced producer at the Shenyang Garment Factory No. 1, who improved production by adjusting labor organization.

    This was a well-thought-out, continuous report. It focused on reporting Jiang Wanshou's advanced experience, how to promote the experience of advanced producers, and the effects of promotion.

    The Shenyang Daily’s report on promoting Jiang Wanshou’s experience, on the January 10th edition, was concentrated, almost taking up the entire page, and published the news of the “Conference to Promote Jiang Wanshou’s Experience,” the editorial “Seriously Promote Advanced Experience,” and photographs of "Practical Demonstration," etc. The news indicated that in promoting Jiang Wanshou's advanced production experience, the Shenyang Daily not only delved into practical work to discover and write this report, but also was one of the organizers of the "Conference to Promote Jiang Wanshou's Experience." The Shenyang Daily, located in an industrial city, placed itself in practical work and systematically promoted advanced experience in production, which created a good example of newspapers combining with practice. Comrade Xu Zhi, the director of the Shenyang Daily, pointed out in his speech at the “Conference to Promote Jiang Wanshou’s Advanced Production Experience”: "The newspaper office assisted the Garment Bureau and the Garment Workers’ Union in conducting preliminary research and held a demonstration; in the future, the newspaper office will regularly adopt this working method to disseminate various advanced experiences." This view of his is correct.

    Because the staff of the Shenyang Daily personally invested themselves in the work of promoting Jiang Wanshou's experience, they were able to start from reality, distinguish right from wrong, discover problems, raise problems, and solve problems. For example, in the editorial "Seriously Promote Advanced Experience," the newspaper sharply criticized the tendency of relying solely on "overtime" and infinitely increasing labor intensity in the production competition movement, while praising Comrade Jiang Wanshou's achievements. The editorial stated: "Currently, many leaders in various industrial systems in Shenyang... the method of increasing production is to increase overtime without limit." They even "disregard national laws, the health of workers, and the occurrence of machine accidents." They do this "some under the pretext of production competition to strive for model status, some under the pretext of large or urgent tasks, and some under the pretext of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the homeland, trying every possible means to increase labor intensity." The result is "mechanical damage, increased accidents, affected worker health, decreased attendance, increased defective products, large losses... etc." It also pointed out that Jiang Wanshou's production experience is worth promoting precisely because it got rid of the backward method of simply relying on overtime, and instead, on the basis of existing human and mechanical equipment, improved production efficiency by adjusting labor organization and improving the relationship between various work links. Both the news and the editorial mentioned that Jiang Wanshou was recently promoted from a worker to the head of the industrial affairs section, and he knew that his responsibility was heavy, "He would be responsible if he did not complete the task. But constantly relying on overtime was not always the answer." So he used another advanced method to replace overtime. This vivid description is of great educational significance for leaders who still use "overtime" to increase production. The editorial affirmed this very positively, saying: "Invention and creation, improving labor organization, improving production tools, and improving operation methods... are the most important methods for running a factory well." There is no doubt that this is a method that should be strongly promoted.

    What needs to be promoted has been clarified, and what needs to be opposed has also been explained, but what method should be used to universally promote these advanced experiences to the masses? In addition to publishing news, editorials, photos, and reflections from various factories in a concentrated manner, the Shenyang Daily also prominently reported on the "Conference to Promote Jiang Wanshou's Experience," and the main content of this conference was "on-site demonstration," which completely broke the old formula of simple "lectures" and "reports." The news made this vivid description of "on-site demonstration": "The demonstrator was sewing worker Zhao Jinglin, because he did not strengthen the work of the assistant worker (that is, change the previous method), all the work of taking, sending, and sorting was done by himself, so the machine would start and stop for a while, and it took 43 minutes and 14 seconds to make 25 sets of clothing parts." Using the new method proposed by Jiang Wanshou, Zhao Jinglin still performed, "All the work of taking, sending, and sorting was done by the assistant worker, and Zhao specialized in operating the sewing machine, only hearing the machine "zha zha..." ringing straight, and the stopping time was very short, and as a result, the same 25 sets of clothing parts only took 30 minutes and 25 seconds, an efficiency increase of 42.6 percent."

    Using this vivid and practical promotion method, representatives of workers from various factories expressed on the spot that they would learn to do it when they returned. The day after - that is, on the January 12th edition of the Shenyang Daily, there were reflections on the success of garment factories such as "Workers' Union" and "Military Dependents" using Jiang Wanshou's method, and the output of each factory increased by more than 25 percent. At the same time, it also published the experimental results of the shoe factory and the third factory under the Garment Bureau, and they proved that Jiang Wanshou's method is also applicable to shoe factories. It is also applicable to other industrial sectors. Therefore, it is also worth promoting to all parts of the country. Then, on the January 14th edition of the Shenyang Daily, it was announced that the Beijing Film Studio of the Central Film Bureau had made a film of Jiang Wanshou's advanced experience and planned to show it across the country to "more widely promote this experience to every place."

    Just in terms of the rapid promotion of Jiang Wanshou's production experience, the Shenyang Daily played a huge role, so the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, in the "Notice on Comrade Jiang Wanshou's Improvement of Labor Organization and Increase of Production," emphasized that it was "because of the newspaper's participation" that "great convenience and effect were achieved in the concentrated and prominent promotion of advanced experience."

    The method of the Shenyang Daily in promoting Jiang Wanshou's advanced production experience is a model worth learning from.

### 报纸结合实际推广先进经验的范例——介绍沈阳日报推广姜万寿经验的报道

　　报纸结合实际推广先进经验的范例
　  ——介绍沈阳日报推广姜万寿经验的报道
    一月十日与十二日，沈阳日报突出地报道了沈阳被服一厂先进生产者姜万寿同志由于调整劳动组织，而提高了生产的经验。
    这是一个有思想的连续报道。它着重地报道了姜万寿的先进经验、以及如何推广先进生产者的经验，并报导了推广后的效果。
    沈阳日报关于推广姜万寿经验的报道，在一月十日的报面上，曾集中地，几乎以一版的全部地位，刊登了《推广姜万寿经验大会》的新闻，《认真推广先进经验》的社论，和《实际表演》的照片等。该新闻表明，在推广姜万寿先进生产经验中，沈阳日报不仅是深入实际工作发掘和采写了这个报道，而且是召开《推广姜万寿经验大会》的举办者之一。位居工业城市的沈阳日报，把自己置身于实际工作中并有系统地推广了生产中的先进经验，这就为报纸结合实际创造了一个良好的例子。沈阳日报社社长徐志同志在“推广姜万寿先进生产经验大会”上的讲话里指出：“报社协助被服局、被服工会，事先进行了研究工作，并举行了表演；今后报社将经常采取这种工作方法来传播各种先进经验。”他这个看法是正确的。
    由于沈阳日报的工作人员亲身投入于推广姜万寿经验的工作之中，他们就能够从实际出发，分辨是非，发现问题，提出问题，一直到解决问题。如在《认真推广先进经验》的社论中，该报就曾经在表扬姜万寿同志的功绩同时，尖锐地批驳了生产竞赛运动中单靠“加班加点”，无限提高劳动强度的偏向。该社论中说：“目前沈阳各产业系统的不少领导者………，提高生产的办法就是无限制的加班加点。”他们甚而“不顾国家的法令，不顾工友的健康，不顾机器出事故。”他们所以这样做，“有的借口生产竞赛争模范，有的借口任务大或任务紧，有的借口抗美援朝保家卫国，想方设法提高劳动强度。”其结果是“机械损坏，事故增多，工人健康受到影响，出勤率下降，废品增多，损耗大………等。”同时也指出了姜万寿的生产经验所以值得推广，正是因为它摆脱了单纯依靠加班加点的落后方法，而在现有的人力条件与机械设备的基础上，用调整劳动组织，改善各个工作环节之间的相互关系中提高了生产效率。在新闻与社论中均曾提到：姜万寿是不久由工人中提拔起来的工务科长，他知道自己的责任重大，“完不成任务要负责。但经常依靠加班加点总不是办法。”于是他就用另一种先进的方法，代替了加班加点。这段生动的描述，对于依然沿用“加班加点”来提高生产量的领导者来说，是有很大教育意义的。社论对此十分肯定地说：“发明创造，改进劳动组织，改进生产工具，改进操作方法……是办好工厂的最重要的方法。”毫无疑问，这是应当极力提倡的方法。
    要提倡的弄清楚了，要反对的也交待明白了，然而用什么方法把这些先进经验普遍地推广到群众中去呢？沈阳日报除集中地发表了新闻、社论、照片，以及各厂的反映外，还特别突出地报道了《推广姜万寿经验大会》，而这次大会的内容主要则是“实地表演”，完全打破了单纯的“讲演”、“报告”的老一套公式。该新闻内对“实地表演”曾作了这样生动的描述：“进行表演的是缝纫工赵景林，因为没有加强帮工工作（即改变前的方法），凡是取送与整理活计，都由他自己来做，因此机器就开一会停一会，这样做了二十五套衣服的零物，费时四十三分十四秒。”而用姜万寿所创议的新方法，仍由赵景林表演，“凡是取送和整理活计，都由帮工来做，赵专门操纵缝纫机，只听机器“轧轧……”直响，停的时间很少，结果同样二十五套衣服的零物，只用了三十分二十五秒，提高效率百分之四十二点六。”
    用这种生动而实际的推广方法，各厂工人代表当场表示回去就要学着办。隔了一天之后——即十二日的沈阳日报上，就出现了“工联”，“军属”等被服厂采用姜万寿方法成功的反映，各厂产量均提高百分之二十五以上。同时，还刊登了被服局所属鞋厂及第三厂的实验结果，他们证明姜万寿的方法，同样适用于制鞋工厂。也同样适用于其他产业部门。因此，也值得向全国各地推广。接着在一月十四日的沈阳日报上，又发表了中央电影局北京制片厂已把姜万寿的先进经验拍成影片的消息，拟在全国放映，把这一经验“更广泛地推广到每个地方”去。
    单就姜万寿生产经验推广之迅速一点来说，沈阳日报是起了巨大作用的，因此沈阳市总工会，在关于“姜万寿同志改进劳动组织，提高生产的通报”中，就强调指出是“由于报社参加”，因而在“集中突出的宣传先进经验上，就取得了很大的便利与效果。”
    沈阳日报在推广姜万寿先进生产经验的方法是值得学习的一个榜样。
