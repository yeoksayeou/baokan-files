Column: Response to Criticism in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

Regarding the article published on page three of the People's Daily on December 8th concerning the serious waste of telegraphs and telephones within the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the China Grain Company, we believe this is a very serious matter that requires a comprehensive anti-waste inspection. Therefore, we were unable to provide an immediate response. Please forgive us. We now provide a public response outlining our inspection findings:

First, we believe the author wrote this article out of concern for national wealth and to eliminate waste, which is excellent. Although the article contains some inaccuracies, we will not relax our inspection of waste simply because of these inaccuracies. The Northern Jiangsu Grain Company and its affiliated organizations consist of a total of thirty-eight units (thirty-three offices and four branch companies). In October, the total postal and telecommunications expenditure was 142,087,170 yuan (inconsistent with the previously published figure of over 278 million yuan). Calculated per unit, each office spends over 3.8 million yuan per month on postal and telecommunications. Judging by this figure, it is not small. At the same time, according to the work requirements set by the higher authorities, we need to report several key statistical figures daily, as well as some special circumstances, via telegraph and telephone, which results in relatively high telecommunications costs. However, due to the frequent communications, we have not done enough to prevent waste. For example, some comrades sometimes lack preparation when using long-distance telephones, and their conversations are not concise and to the point, but rather rambling and repetitive. This is indeed wasteful. Secondly, some comrades make phone calls without considering the urgency or importance. Some issues could be resolved by mail, but instead, they make long-distance calls. Some comrades see others talking to a certain company and seize the opportunity to talk about unimportant matters, without considering whether the topic is worth discussing by telephone. More seriously, some individual comrades even take the liberty of making long-distance calls to chat with their loved ones. Regarding the use of telegrams, some drafting comrades are not concise and clear, and often include unnecessary words. The above-mentioned wasteful phenomena, although arising from the fact that the specialized company was recently established and the work is unfamiliar, deserve our attention and vigilance. In particular, our leadership should conduct a thorough review. Currently, we are determined to overcome the above-mentioned wasteful phenomena and establish strict management systems and cost-saving measures for the use of telephones and telegrams. We welcome any corrections to the above inspection if there are any inappropriate points.

### 中国粮食公司苏北分公司  关于使用电报电话浪费的检查

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　中国粮食公司苏北分公司
    关于使用电报电话浪费的检查编辑同志：
    人民日报十二月八日第三版所刊载关于中国粮食公司苏北分公司在使用电报电话中有严重的浪费现象，我们认为这是一个很严重的问题，须开展一个全面的反浪费检查，故没有能即时给予答复，请原谅。现将我们所检查的情形，作一公开答复：
    首先我们认为作者写这篇稿子，是为了爱护国家财富，杜绝浪费，这是很好的。虽然那篇稿子与事实有些出入，但我们也决不因事实有了出入而放松了对浪费现象的检查。我们苏北粮食公司所属各机构一共有三十八个单位（三十三个办事处、四个支公司），在十月份共支出邮电费一亿四千二百零八万七千一百七十元（与原刊载数字二亿七千八百余万元不符），如以单位计算，每处每月需支出邮电费三百八十万余元。根据这个数字来看，是不能算小的。同时上级订定的工作要求，我们每天几种主要数字的统计，以及一些特殊情况的反映，都需要用电报及电话向上汇报，因此在使用电费上是比较多的。但是，由于电讯的频繁，我们应如何不使浪费现象产生，在这方面还是做得不够，例如有时某些同志在使用长途电话时，事先缺乏准备，谈话时不能简单扼要，噜噜苏苏，讲了又讲，在这些方面，是确实浪费的。其次，有的同志打电话，有时不分缓急轻重，有些问题，是可以用信函去解决的，却打了长途电话；有的同志看到别人在与某一个公司通话时，他也就趁机接着讲些不重要的事情，没有考虑到所谈的问题是否值得用电话去谈；更严重的，有个别同志竟擅自打长途电话去找爱人谈心。关于使用电报方面，个别拟稿同志不能扼要简明，往往写上一些虚字。以上种种浪费现象，虽然是在专业公司成立不久，工作生疏的情况下产生的，但这是值得我们重视与警惕的，特别是我们领导上更应作深刻的检讨。目前，我们决心克服了以上种种浪费现象，订出对使用电话电报严格管理制度与节省办法。以上检查如有不妥之处，尚希指正。
