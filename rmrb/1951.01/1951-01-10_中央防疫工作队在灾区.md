　　Central Anti-Epidemic Team in Disaster Areas
　　Central Health Department News Team
　　In March of last year, the first spring after the establishment of the Central People's Government, the Central Health Department's anti-epidemic headquarters was established, and successively organized and trained seven mobile anti-epidemic brigades. From the first day of their departure, the anti-epidemic teams brought scientific medical knowledge to the vast countryside based on the principle of "facing workers and peasants." In rain, mud, river embankments, fields, and various environments, they fought to relieve the disasters and illnesses of the people who had long been persecuted under imperialism and feudalism. Over the past eight months, based on the principle of "prevention first," the anti-epidemic teams have focused on eliminating sources of disease by renovating wells and toilets, ensuring the health and safety of women and children, reducing the spread of disease through lice and scabies eradication, and treating endemic diseases in more than ten heavily affected counties in the Yellow River flood area, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and Pingyuan Province, enabling scientific hygiene work to begin to take root in these areas.

　　　　On the 800-Li Long River Embankment
　　The first batch of anti-epidemic teams used most of their strength to cooperate with river management projects. At that time, three projects were underway: the Yellow River flood area management, the northern Jiangsu diversion of the Yi River, and the Chaobai River management. These three projects totaled 851 li in length, with over 800,000 migrant workers participating in the river management. It was indeed an arduous task for more than two hundred anti-epidemic team members to be responsible for the hygiene work of over 800,000 migrant workers. Moreover, these areas were all disaster areas with many patients, making the task even more difficult. At that time, the anti-epidemic team in the Yellow River flood area demonstrated a high degree of responsibility, treating patients day and night, preparing for outpatient calls within one minute during the day and five minutes at night, and using spare time to write health propaganda materials, conducting health education for migrant workers anytime and anywhere, promoting the establishment of toilets and the renovation of wells, and helping individual areas solve the difficulty of not being able to boil water due to a lack of firewood. In this way, the threat of gastrointestinal diseases was finally reduced in a short period of time. In the Yi River diversion project, the emotions of the migrant workers were once affected by the epidemic of relapsing fever. After focusing on lice eradication and the suppression of relapsing fever, the migrant workers' concerns were eliminated, and the smooth progress of the project was ensured, laying the foundation for the subsequent stage of rural environmental hygiene work.

　　　　Relying on the Masses to Promote Environmental Hygiene Work
　　In promoting rural environmental hygiene, each team encountered various difficulties. However, the resolution of these difficulties provided the cadres with beneficial education, and everyone further recognized the importance of relying on the masses. For example, when carrying out rural lice eradication work in northern Jiangsu, due to the scarcity of medicines, steam lice eradication was necessary. However, the original steam devices of the anti-epidemic team were very bulky and costly, making them extremely difficult to promote in rural areas. After much research, steam devices were modified using gasoline drums, which were lightweight and economical, greatly improving work efficiency. Now, the masses in many places in the Huaiyin area have organized to use this method for lice eradication.
　　Xihua County in the Yellow River flood area had never had toilets. After the Yellow River breached its banks, sewage invaded the wells, and flies were everywhere, becoming a medium for infectious diseases. The anti-epidemic team immediately began to make demonstration wells and toilets and conducted extensive publicity to the masses through the migrant workers who had participated in river management. After the masses recognized its benefits, they dug toilets and repaired wells one after another. To date, more than 7,000 toilets have been built in the county, effectively reducing the possibility of disease spread and solving part of the fertilizer problem in agricultural production.
　　At the same time, local diseases were treated with a focus. The Huaiyin area in northern Jiangsu, where the Third Brigade was located, is one of the areas in China with a relatively high incidence of kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis). According to surveys, the highest incidence rate in the area accounts for one percent of the resident population, which has a significant impact on production. The kala-azar prevention and treatment team of the brigade has treated more than 9,000 people in the vicinity of Huaiyin. According to a subsequent survey, the condition of 80 percent of the patients improved after treatment. In addition, each team has conducted research and treatment on relapsing fever, yaws, and other diseases.

　　　　Enabling Scientific Medical Knowledge to Take Root in the Countryside
　　All comrades working in the anti-epidemic teams have this confidence: not only to bring scientific medical and health knowledge to the vast countryside but also to enable this knowledge to take root and sprout there. Therefore, each anti-epidemic team united and organized local Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, cultural and educational groups, etc., to carry out work together. This is one of the important reasons why the anti-epidemic teams have achieved greater success. At the same time, the anti-epidemic teams helped various places establish medical associations, health committees, and other organizations, and successively trained 1,344 Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, 2,830 new and old midwives, and 151 cadres for women and children. In northern Anhui, laboratory personnel were also trained. These works have played a great role in improving rural health conditions, raising the level of public health knowledge, and implementing the principle of "prevention first." For example, old gentlemen in Sixian County, northern Anhui, who had received training, automatically organized a joint anti-epidemic team to suppress infectious diseases when they discovered them. In terms of maternal and child health, the promotion of new methods of delivery has greatly reduced the mortality rate of infant umbilical cord infections (tetanus) in these areas. Taking Sixian County in northern Anhui as an example, the average mortality rate of infant umbilical cord infections in the past was 16.2 percent, but it has now dropped to 4.2 percent. The masses gratefully said: "Chairman Mao is really thoughtful, he even cares about childbirth!"

　　　　The Anti-Epidemic Team Itself Has Made Progress
　　The work over the past eight months has given the staff of each team a lesson. When they first arrived in the countryside, some comrades could not get used to rural life. For example, when eradicating lice for the masses, they pinched the dirty clothes with two fingers, turned their faces away, and covered their noses, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. After criticism and education from the leadership, and after witnessing the great creations of the working people with their own eyes, they changed their past incorrect views of the working people. They were deeply moved and said: "The hundred-li-long embankment was built up like this, one load at a time." In terms of working methods, some individual teams initially moved a set of urban outpatient procedures to the countryside. For example, a certain brigade in the Yellow River flood area adopted very cumbersome outpatient procedures. At that time, there were many patients, sometimes more than 300 people a day, resulting in a very chaotic outpatient room. After consulting with the administration and mass organizations, they changed the procedure so that the health assistants in each district would register the patients in advance, and then each district would take turns to see the patients. In this way, on the one hand, the chaos of the work was reduced, and on the other hand, the condition of each person could be understood in a timely manner. It was in such a work process that the political and technical level of the team members was generally improved, and close relationships were established with the masses.

　　　　The Masses Thank Chairman Mao
　　The anti-epidemic teams brought Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's care for the people to the masses through their work. When the anti-epidemic teams left, many people wrote letters to Chairman Mao with gratitude, reporting on production and living conditions. When the masses in northern Jiangsu left, they specially asked them to bring sweet potatoes and other agricultural products to Chairman Mao, and wrote a letter to Chairman Mao expressing that they must step up production in the future to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

　　中央防疫工作队在灾区
    中央卫生部通讯组
    去年三月，中央人民政府成立后的第一个春天，中央卫生部的防疫总队成立后，先后组织训练了七个机动的防疫大队。防疫队从出发的第一天起，便根据“面向工农”的方针，把科学的医学常识带到了广大的农村。他们在雨里、泥里、河堤上、田里以及各种各样的环境里，为解除在帝国主义和封建主义长期迫害下的人民的灾害病痛而斗争。八个月来，防疫队根据“预防为主”的方针，在黄泛区、皖北、苏北、平原省等十多个遭受重灾的县，有重点地进行了杜绝病源的改建水井厕所工作，保障下一代健康安全的妇婴卫生工作，减少疾病传染蔓延机会的灭虱灭疥工作，以及地方病治疗等工作，使科学卫生工作在这些地区开始生根发芽。
            在八百多里长的河堤上
    第一批成立的防疫队伍用大部力量配合治河工程进行工作。当时正在进行的三处工程：黄泛区治河、苏北导沂，潮白河治河，这三处工程共长八百五十一华里，参加治河的民工共八十多万。以二百多个防疫队员担负八十多万民工的卫生工作，确是一件艰苦的工作。而且这些地区都是灾区，病员很多，任务显得更其繁重了。当时在黄泛区的防疫队发挥了高度负责的精神，日夜为病员治疗，做到白天在一分钟内、黑夜在五分钟内作好出诊准备，并利用空隙时间编写卫生宣传材料，随时随地对民工进行卫生教育，推动大家设立厕所，改造水井，并帮助个别地区解决缺乏柴草不能烧水的困难。这样，终于在短时期内减少了肠胃病的威胁。在导沂工程中，也曾一度因回归热流行而影响到民工情绪，后经有重点地进行灭虱和扑灭回归热的工作后，消除了民工的顾虑，保证了工程的顺利进行。并为后一阶段的农村环境卫生工作打下了基础。
            依靠群众推展环境卫生工作
    在推广农村环境卫生的工作中，各队同样遇到了各种困难。但这些困难的解决，使干部们得到了有益的教育，大家进一步认识了依靠群众的重要。如在苏北进行农村灭虱工作时，因为药品少，必须以蒸汽灭虱。但防疫队原有的蒸汽器很笨重，成本又贵，在农村中极难推广。经多方研究后，即用汽油桶改制蒸汽器，轻便而经济，使工作效率大为提高。现在，淮阴专区很多地方的群众已组织起来，利用这种方法进行灭虱。
    黄泛区的西华县，一向没有厕所的，黄河决口后，污水侵入水井，到处是苍蝇，成为传染病的媒介。防疫队即动手做出示范水井和厕所，通过曾参加治河的民工向群众进行广泛宣传。群众认识了它的好处后，纷纷挖厕所，修井。截至目前止，该县已建立厕所七千多个，有效地减少了疾病蔓延的可能，并解决了农业生产中部分肥料问题。
    同时，各地有重点地进行了地方病治疗。三大队所在地的苏北淮阴专区，是中国黑热病比较严重的地区之一。据调查，该地最高的发病率，占居民人口数百分之一，对生产影响很大。该队的黑热病防治小组，在淮阴附近先后医疗了九千多人，据事后调查，其中有百分之八十的病人经治疗后病情减轻。此外，对回归热、雅司病等，各队亦分别进行了研究和治疗。
            使科学的医学知识在农村生根发芽
    防疫队全体工作同志都有这样的信心：不但要把科学的医学卫生常识带到广大的农村里去，并且要使这些常识在那里生根发芽。因此，各防疫队团结和组织了当地的中西医、文教团体等，共同进行工作。这是防疫队获得较大成绩的重要原因之一。同时，防疫队帮助各地建立了医联会、卫生委员会等组织，先后训练中西医师一千三百四十四人、新旧产婆二千八百三十人，妇婴干部一百五十一人。在皖北还训练了化验人员。这些工作，在改善农村卫生情况、提高群众的卫生常识水平、贯彻“预防为主”的方针等方面，起了很大的推动作用。如皖北泗县受过训练的老先生们在发现传染病时，曾自动组织联合防疫队，扑灭了传染病。在妇幼卫生方面由于新法接生的推行，使这些地区的婴儿脐风（破伤风）的死亡率大大降低，以皖北泗县为例，过去婴儿脐风死亡率平均是百分之十六点二，现已降至百分之四点二，群众感激地说：“毛主席想的真周到，连生孩子的事都惦记着呢！”
            防疫队本身获得了进步
    八个月来的工作，给各队工作人员上了一次课。他们初到农村时，某些同志不能习惯于农村生活，如在给群众灭虱时，用两个手指捏着脏衣服，扭转脸，掩着鼻子去做，引起群众不满。他们经过领导上的批评教育，又亲眼看到劳动人民的伟大创造后，改变了过去对劳动人民的不正确看法。他们深深感动地说：“近百里的长堤，就这样一挑挑一担担的把它堆了起来。”在工作方法上，开始个别队曾把城市的一套门诊手续搬到农村。如某大队在黄泛区，采用很繁琐的门诊手续，那时病员很多，有时一天有三百多人，结果弄得门诊室很混乱。他们与行政上和群众团体商量研究后，改由各区的卫生助理在事先将病人进行登记，然后一个区一个区轮流地去看。这样，一方面减少了工作的混乱现象，同时又可及时地了解各人的病况。就在这样工作过程中，队员的政治和技术水平普遍提高，并和群众建立了密切的关系。
            群众感谢毛主席
    防疫队从工作中把毛主席、中央人民政府对人民的关怀带给了群众。当防疫队离开时，很多群众怀着感激的心情写信给毛主席，报告生产情况和生活情形。苏北群众在防疫队离开时，特地托他们把白薯等农产物带给毛主席，并写信给毛主席表示今后一定要加紧生产，支援人民解放军解放台湾。
