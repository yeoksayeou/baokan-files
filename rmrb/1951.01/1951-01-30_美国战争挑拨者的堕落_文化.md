　　The Degenerate "Culture" of American Warmongers
    Soviet Union, Fuladijin Lubin
    Editor's Note: The original article is over 10,000 words long and was published in the seventh issue of the "Bolshevik" magazine in April 1950. This article is a summary of the translation by Comrade Yu Jian.

    In the United States, the militarization of all cultural sectors is being rapidly implemented. Schools, newspapers, literature, and movies are all being used on a large scale by the American ruling class for war propaganda. All means are being used to spread the predatory ideas of American imperialism among the masses.

    American progressive journalist Johannes Steel was shocked to see the "Cold War" policy – in his words – growing into fascism in the United States. He saw a particularly great crisis in the militarization of schools. Steel pointed out that schools have become "a tool of open propaganda, the purpose of which is to cultivate a generation of Americans who have lost their ability to think, a generation of savages." (Monthly "World Affairs Report").

    In 1949, a special report was drafted in the United States stipulating the tasks of American schools under modern conditions. This report was jointly drafted by the well-known reactionary professor James Conant and General Eisenhower. The progressive circles in the United States rose up against this report, and they accurately confirmed the direct relationship between the basic arguments of this report and the fascist arguments of Hitler and Mussolini.

    The New York Teachers Union called the report a shameful document, saying that its purpose was to put "any teacher with independent thinking in the United States under threat." The so-called "any teacher with independent thinking" is any teacher who is unwilling to train his students into soldiers of Wall Street.

    The American warlords are more and more rudely and openly seizing American institutions of higher learning into their own hands. The bourgeois political commentator Bod Sachant's book "Dangerous Tendencies" pointed out the increasingly close relationship between institutions of higher learning and American warlords. The leaders of American institutions of higher learning who are happy to discuss science, freedom and independence, fawn on the most reactionary military representatives. Harvard, Yale, and Princeton universities are competing to award honorary "scientific" degrees to Eisenhower, Clark, Byrdson, Bradley, and other army and navy generals. Eisenhower was even appointed as the president of Columbia University, and once, together with some of his "colleagues," was active as an "expert" on education issues.

    The reactionary elements' unscrupulous control of schools has resulted in the use of humanitarian sciences in the United States for the "spiritual" preparation for new wars. Geography is replaced by German fascist geopolitics, while "biology" promotes racial discrimination, with the "superior" Anglo-Saxon race being superior to all nations in the world.

    The reactionaries have also assigned a considerable position to literature in terms of war preparation. Therefore, in modern American literature, various forms of "atomic" advertisements – long and short novels, etc. – have gained wide dissemination. The purpose of these works is to scare readers with the horrors of a seemingly inevitable atomic war.

    American publishers have turned the sale of "horror literature" into a profitable industry. Recently, five new publishers specializing in the publication of "atomic" "science fiction" books have opened in the United States.

    In reactionary magazines, there are more and more articles stipulating the tasks that American imperialism puts forward to literature. As early as 1949, news came out that a plan was being drafted to establish a special agency for "writers and artists to learn methods of conducting ideological warfare." Wall Street demands the creation of new "artistic works" to justify its plunder plans. Harry Harrison Smith, one of the editors of the American reactionary literary newspaper "Saturday Review of Literature," wrote an article in September 1949 attacking "writers who look at America with pessimistic eyes," that is, writers who truthfully describe American reality. He suggested turning to "optimistic" themes, in other words, – praising the "American way of life" and war preparation.

    The United States publishes hundreds of books on religious mysticism every year, such as readings about demons and spells. In the plays of O'Neill, Valdell and other reactionary playwrights, the image of man is belittled in every possible way. The authors attempt to prove the "unshakable" nature of the capitalist system, the unchangeable nature of human nature, and the uselessness and meaninglessness of any struggle against social injustice.

    Books and films manufactured according to the instructions of the reactionaries promote the praise of banditry. The famous American progressive writer Howard Fast published a booklet in the summer of 1949 called "Intellectuals Fighting for Peace." The author wrote in the book when talking about the products of Hollywood and the mass-dumped "best-selling books": "Robbers and torturers have become American-style national heroes, and are depicted as supermen."

    Because in the United States in this situation, banditry is one of the disguised businesses, so books like Robbins' novel "Never Love a Stranger" are emerging one after another. Robbins' book even had to be called "a guide on how to be a gangster" by critics of the bourgeois "New York Times."

    American imperialists are striving to train a cadre of hired murderers, and they are trying their best to encourage the manufacture and dissemination of inferior detective novels and murder novels. The mission of these works is to instigate readers: the desire to kill is a long-standing trait of human nature. For example, a novel by Charles Jackson published in 1948 is typical in this regard. The "New York Times" critic commented on the book: "Jackson's task is to prove that we all have the nature to kill."

    The bourgeois literary scholar Phelps, in proving the reason why "murder novels" are widely circulated in capitalist America, openly said: These books are very precious because they make readers pay no attention to social problems. But this explanation is incomplete. Murder novels and movies depicting crime and violence (according to some researchers, of the 1,500 films produced in the United States for many years, 80% directly promote crime and pornography) are valued by the reactionaries for another reason. It is that they can incite the lowest instincts and cultivate a cynical contempt for human life and human dignity. American reactionaries see this preaching of killing and violence as one of the means of training murderers and robbers.

    Appreciating various crimes and defending books and films for murderers, thugs, spies, and secret agents is not the ultimate goal of the American reactionaries. They are being used to promote the robber "morality" of American fascists and to train the mercenary cadres of American imperialism. "Bankers produce bandits," Gorky wrote as early as 1929. Now, when Wall Street tycoons are appearing as instigators of a new world war, this degenerate influence of American imperialism is particularly powerful.

    The advanced elements of the United States are heroically opposing the heinous war conspiracies of the American warmongers, and they have never suffered persecution like they have in recent years. Any remarks sympathizing with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are regarded as treason in the United States and become an excuse for being fired, blacklisted, and oppressed.

    American reactionaries have adopted Hitler's experience not only in war propaganda but also in pursuing progressive circles. Warmongers are using all means – from bribery to open acts of terror. "The reactionaries treat intellectuals with dollars in one hand and guns in the other," Howard Fast wrote. In Truman's America, all progressive writers, artists, and cultural activists who refuse to create according to Wall Street's instructions are attacked.

    When the infamous "Un-American" Activities Investigation Committee prosecuted a group of progressive screenwriters and film directors, Dalton Trumbo, one of the "defendants," a writer and screenwriter, said: "You make this city similar to the capital of a certain country on the eve of the Reichstag fire... Anyone who remembers the situation in Germany in 1933 will smell the smoke here, in this hall."

    However, despite terror and intimidation, the power of the progressive America that stands in opposition to Truman and Dulles' America is increasing and growing stronger. Progressive American cultural activists see their first task as fighting against American imperialism and defending peace and friendship among nations. When the American Scientists and Cultural Workers' Peace Conference was held in New York in 1949, more than 1,000 writers, political commentators, and critics participated in the meeting of the conference's literary group alone. Prominent American scientists, writers, and screenwriters participated in the work of the conference.

    The ideologues of the American reactionaries attempt to deceive the masses of the people, primarily influencing intellectuals. They strive to create an impression, as if the American Communists and progressive cultural workers are opposed to all the culture of the United States, opposed to all the traditions of the American people. Nothing is further from the truth than this fabricated assertion of the imperialist ideologues. They dare to equate themselves with the American people. "In every modern nation, there are two nations... In every national culture, there are two national cultures," Lenin wrote. Lenin pointed out: "Every national culture has elements of democratic and socialist culture, perhaps undeveloped, because in every nation there are laboring and exploited masses..." (Complete Works, Volume 20, 4th edition, page 16).

    The progressives in the United States have repeatedly mentioned in their creations the progressive traditions that the Wall Street ideologues are trying to slander and defame. "The American people," Lenin pointed out, "have the revolutionary traditions accepted by the excellent representatives of the American proletariat." (Collected Works, Volume 23, page 184). These traditions are linked to the history of the American War of Independence and the Civil War. The Communists and progressives in the United States respect these glorious histories of the American people, and they expose the attempts of the imperialist reactionaries to distort the significance of these historical events, especially the attempts to idealize the Southern slave owners in novels and movies. Progressive writers portray a true picture of their country's past in their historical works. At the same time, the reality of modern America can only be reflected realistically in the works of progressive writers who are connected to the people.

　　美国战争挑拨者的堕落“文化”
    苏联  符拉德金·鲁宾
    编者按：本篇原文长万余字，载于一九五○年四月《布尔什维克》杂志第七期。本文是于健同志的译文的摘要。
    在美国，正在快速度地实现一切文化部门的军国主义化。学校、报刊、文学、电影，都大规模地被美国统治阶级利用于战争宣传。一切手段都被运用于在群众中间传布美帝国主义的强盗思想。
    美国进步记者约翰纳斯·斯蒂尔，看到“冷战”政策——用他的话说——在美国滋长成法西斯主义而感到触目惊心，他看出特别大的危机是在于学校的军国主义化。斯蒂尔指出：学校变成了“一种公开宣传的工具，目的是为了培养一代丧失掉思想能力的美国人，培养一代野人。”（《世界事务报告》月刊）。
    一九四九年，在美国草订了一个特别报告，规定了在现代条件之下美国学校的任务。这个报告是著名的反动教授杰姆斯·柯南特和艾森豪威尔将军共同起草的。美国的进步阶层群起反对这个报告，他们确切证实了这个报告的基本论点与希特勒、墨索里尼的法西斯论调之间的直接关系。
    纽约教员联合会称这个报告为可耻的文件，说它的目的是使美国“任何一个有独立思想的教员都处在威胁之下”。所谓“任何一个有独立思想的教员”，也就是任何一个不愿意把自己的学生培养成华尔街的兵士的教员。
    美国军阀越来越粗暴地、越露骨地把美国的高等学校攫夺到自己的手里。资产阶级政论家波德·萨琴特的《危险的倾向》一书，指出了高等学校与美国军阀之间的日益密切的关系。乐于讨论科学的《自由和独立》的美国高等学校的领导者们，向最反动的军界代表们献媚。哈佛、耶鲁、普林斯顿各大学，争先恐后地把荣誉的“科学”学位授予艾森豪威尔、克拉克、柏德逊、布莱德雷和其他陆海军将领。艾森豪威尔甚至被任命为哥伦比亚大学的校长，而且曾经和他的某些“同僚们”在一起，以教育问题“专家”的地位活跃过。
    反动分子对学校的肆无忌惮的控制，结果使得人道主义的科学在美国被利用于新战争的“精神”准备。地理学被德国法西斯式的地缘政治学所代替，而“生物学”则宣传人种歧视、“高等的”盎格鲁萨克逊种优于世界一切民族。
    反动派也给文学在备战方面指定了不小的位置。所以现代美国文学中，各种形式的“原子”广告——长篇和短篇的小说等等——获得了广大的传布。这些作品的目的是想以仿佛难免的原子战争的恐怖来吓唬读者。
    美国的出版家使“恐怖文学”的贩卖变成一本万利的行业。最近在美国开设了五家专门出版“原子”类《科学幻想》书籍的新出版社。
    在反动的杂志上，规定美帝国主义向文学提出的任务的论文，越来越多了。远在一九四九年，就传出消息，说正在草订关于成立一个“作家和艺术家学习进行思想战争方法”的特别机关的计划。华尔街要求制造新的“艺术作品”来为它的掠夺计划辩护。美国反动派的文学机关报《星期六文学评论》的编辑之一哈里生·斯密士，在一九四九年九月写的一篇论文，攻击《以悲观的眼光看美国的作家》，即真实地描写美国现实的作家。他建议转向“乐观的”题材，换句话说，——就是歌颂“美国生活方式”和备战。
    美国每年要出版好几百种宗教神秘主义的题材的书籍，例如关于妖魔、符咒之类的读物。在奥尼尔、瓦尔德耳和其他反动剧作家们的剧本中，以一切方法来贬低人的形象。作者们企图证明资本主义制度的“不可动摇”、人的本性的难改、向社会的不公平作任何斗争的没有好处，没有意义。
    依照反动派的指使而制造的书籍和影片，促进着对于盗匪作风的赞美。美国著名进步作家霍华德·法斯特在一九四九年夏天发表了一本小册子，名叫《为和平而斗争的知识分子》。作者在该书中论到好莱坞的产品和大量倾销的“畅销书”时写道：“强盗和拷打者成为美国式的民族英雄，被描写成超人。”
    因为在美国的这种情形下，盗匪主义就是变相的生意经之一，所以像罗宾斯的小说《不能爱陌生人》之类的书籍层出不穷。罗宾斯的这本书，甚至连资产阶级的《纽约时报》的批评家也不得不称它为“怎样当土匪的指南”。
    美帝国主义者努力培养雇佣的杀人犯干部，他们竭力鼓励劣等的侦探小说和谋杀案小说的制造和传布。这些作品的使命是教唆读者：杀人的渴望是由来已久的人性的特质。例如一九四八年出版的查理斯·杰克逊的一部小说，就是这方面的典型。《纽约时报》批评家论该书道：“杰克逊的任务是想证明我们人人都有杀人的天性。”
    资产阶级文学家费尔浦斯，在证明“谋杀案小说”在资本主义美国广泛流传的原因时，公开说：这些书籍是很珍贵的，因为它们使读者不注意社会问题。但是这个说明是不完全的。谋杀小说和描写犯罪和暴行的电影（据某些研究家估计，许多年来美国所出产的一、五○○部影片中，有百分之八十是直接宣传犯罪和诲淫的），所以被反动派看重，还有另外一个原因，就是它们可以煽动最低级的本能，培养对人的生命和人的尊严的犬儒主义的蔑视。美国反动分子看出这种杀人和暴行的说教是训练杀人犯和强盗的手段之一。
    欣赏各种罪行和为杀人犯、暴徒、间谍和特务辩护的书籍和影片，并不是美国反动派的最后目的。它们是被利用于宣传美国法西斯党徒的强盗“道德”，被利用于训练美帝国主义的佣兵干部的。“银行家产生盗匪”，高尔基远在一九二九年就这样写过。现在，当华尔街大亨们正在以新的世界大战的发动者的角色出现的时候，美帝国主义的这种堕落的影响表现得特别有力了。
    美国的先进分子是英勇地反对美国战争挑拨者的万恶的战争阴谋的，他们从来没有遭受过像最近几年来所受到的迫害。任何同情苏联和人民民主国家的言论，在美国都被看作叛国罪行，而成为被解雇、被列入“黑名单”和遭受压迫的借口。
    美国反动分子不但在战争宣传方面，而且在追究进步阶层方面，也采用了希特勒的经验。战争挑拨者们施用着一切手段——从收买到公开的恐怖行动。“反动派是一手拿着美元，另一手拿着手枪对待知识分子的，”——霍华德·法斯特写道。在杜鲁门的美国，一切进步的作家、艺术家，一切拒绝遵照华尔街指令创作的文化活动家，都受到打击。
    当恶名昭彰的“非美”活动调查委员会，对一群进步的电影剧本作家和电影导演起诉的时候，“被告”之一的作家兼电影剧本作家达尔顿·特朗博说：“你们使这个城市类似国会纵火案前夜的某国首都了……凡是记得一九三三年德国的情形的人，都会在这里、在这所大厅里闻到烟味。”
    然而不顾恐怖和恫吓，和杜鲁门、杜勒斯的美国相对立的进步美国的力量，正在日益增加，日益强大。美国进步的文化活动家看出他们第一个任务，就是进行反对美帝国主义、保卫各民族间的和平与友好的斗争。当一九四九在纽约召开美国科学家，和文化工作者保卫和平大会的时候，仅仅在大会文学组的会议上，就有一千多名作家、政论家和批评家参加。参加大会工作的有美国著名的科学家、作家和电影剧本作家。
    美国反动派的思想家，企图欺骗人民群众，首先影响知识分子。他们努力造成一种印象，仿佛美国共产党人和进步的文化工作者是反对美国的一切文化，反对美国人民的一切传统的。再没有什么东西比帝国主义思想家们的这种伪造的论断更远离真理了。他们竟敢把自己和美国人民同等看待。“每一个现代的民族里，都有着两个民族……每一个民族文化里，都有着两个民族文化，”——列宁写道。列宁指出：“每一个民族文化都有着也许是不发达的民主和社会主义文化的成份，因为每一个民族里都有着劳动的和被剥削的群众……”（全集，二十卷，四版，一六页）。
    美国的进步人士一再在他们的创作里提到华尔街思想家们企图中伤和诽谤的进步传统。“美国人民”列宁指出，“有着美国无产阶级的优秀代表们所接受的革命传统。”（文集，二十三卷，一八四页）。这些传统是和美国独立战争和南北战争的历史联系着的。美国的共产党人和进步分子是尊敬美国人民的这些光荣历史的，他们揭发帝国主义反动派歪曲这些历史事件的意义，特别是在小说和电影里把南方奴隶主加以理想化的企图。进步作家们在他们的历史著作里描绘出一幅自己国家过去的真实图画。同时现代美国的现实也只有在那些和人民有联系的进步作家的作品里，才能得到它的现实主义的反映。
