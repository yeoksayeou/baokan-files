　　Massive Conscription of Students as Cannon Fodder for Aggression
    American Universities Unable to Conduct Regular Studies
    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from New York, TASS] Newspaper reports indicate that as a result of the massive conscription of students to serve as cannon fodder for aggression, regular studies in American higher education institutions have disintegrated. Students of conscription age are dispirited, and their academic performance is worse than before. Educational leaders are not only deeply concerned about the dismal performance of the current academic year but also about the bleak prospects for future enrollment in various educational institutions.
    The "Chicago Daily News" recently published a commentary pointing out the poor conditions in the seven largest colleges in Chicago, which have 40,000 students. The commentary cited statements from college presidents and lecturers, who unanimously pointed out that studies are very lax and feared that the number of students in the next academic year would be much smaller than in the current year. The Vice-President of Northwestern University, Wald, which has 10,000 students, declared to reporters: "It is expected that the number of students in American universities will be greatly reduced."
    James Hersch, the president of another university with 8,000 students, stated that in his opinion, the university would reduce its activities by half in the next academic year.
    The pessimism of the administrative authorities of various educational institutions was also confirmed by Ernest Miller, a representative of the University of Chicago, which has 7,000 students. Miller said: "Apart from the reduction of university subjects as a result of conscription, we do not know what else awaits us."
    The commentary continued: In the next academic year, the number of students in all seven universities will decrease by 10 to 50 percent. The commentator wrote: "Millions of students cannot get an answer to the urgent question: Will they be able to continue their studies in the next academic year? They cannot give any answer in this regard."

　　大量强征学生充当侵略炮灰
    美国大学已无法进行正规学习
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：据报纸消息：由于征召大量学生充当侵略炮灰的结果，美国高等教育机关的正规学习已经解体，兵役年龄的学生们都意气消沉，他们学习的成绩比以前更要坏些。教育机关的领袖们不但对本届学年的凄惨成绩，而且对各教育机关将来注册的黯淡景况，都感到非常的不安。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”最近发表评论，指出拥有四万名学生的芝加哥七个最大学院的不良情况。评论中引证学院院长和讲师们的声明，他们一致指出学习非常松懈，并忧惧在下一学年中学生的数目将要较本届少得多。拥有一万名学生的西北大学副校长瓦尔德向新闻记者宣称：“预料美国各大学的学生数目将要大量的减少。”
    拥有八千名学生的另一个大学的校长詹姆斯·赫许声称：在他看来，在下一学年中大学将减少一半活动。
    各教育机关行政当局的悲观主义，也由拥有七千名学生的芝加哥大学代表爱恩斯特·密勒所确证。密勒说：“除了因征兵的结果而把大学的学科缩减以外，我们不知道还有什么事在等待着我们。”
    评论继称：在下一学年中，所有七个大学的学生数目，将减少百分之十到百分之五十。评论员写道：“数百万学生对下面这样一个火急的问题不能得到答复：他们在下一学年中还能够继续求学吗？在这方面他们不能给与任何回答。”
