To the Editor:

　　I think the "Decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on the Unified Purchase of Cotton Yarn" published in the People's Daily on January 4th is completely correct and meets the needs of the general public. Take my hometown, Gaoyang County, for example. The Gaoyang area has a history of weaving (household handicraft industry) for decades, and about 80% or more of the county's population relies on weaving for a living (directly or indirectly). Since the liberation of the mainland, prices have gradually stabilized. When speculators saw that they could not manipulate gold, silver, cloth, and food, they targeted cotton yarn. When cotton yarn was insufficient to meet market demand, they hoarded it in large quantities. Ordinary small vendors, in order to be affected by price fluctuations, also priced goods in cotton yarn, or used cotton yarn directly in the market to replace RMB currency. For example, peanut sellers and meat sellers all quoted prices in cotton yarn, resulting in insufficient supply of cotton yarn for production, which led to rising yarn prices. Moreover, it created a large disparity between market prices and the prices of China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation (for example, in early November last year, a bundle of yarn on the market was 40,000 to 50,000 yuan higher than the price of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation). This inevitably affected the development of legitimate industry and commerce.

　　The government's decision to implement the unified purchase of cotton yarn truly represents the interests and demands of the majority of the people. It is an indispensable measure to combat a small number of speculators, stabilize prices, and stabilize people's lives. In addition to wholeheartedly supporting this decision, we will respond to this decision with practical actions in actively increasing production.

### 拥护财经委员会关于统购棉纱的决定

　　拥护财经委员会关于统购棉纱的决定编辑同志：
    一月四日人民日报刊载《政务院财政经济委员会关于统购棉纱的决定》，我觉得这一决定是完全正确的，是符合人民大众要求的。就按我的家乡高阳县来说吧，高阳地区是有数十年的织布（家庭手工业）历史，全县约有百分之八十以上的人口是依靠织布为生的（直接或间接的）。自全国大陆解放以后，物价渐趋稳定，投机商们见到金银、布匹、食粮不能操纵时，就看中了棉纱；当棉纱不足市场的需要时，就大肆囤积。一般的小商贩，为了受物价波动的影响，也都以棉纱作价，或以棉纱直接在市场上代替人民币流通。如卖花生的、卖肉的都以棉纱说价，因而形成棉纱对生产上供应不足，致纱价高涨。而且造成市价与花纱布公司牌价的很大悬殊（如去年十一月初时一捆纱市价高于花纱布公司牌价四、五万元）。这必然也影响了正当工商业的发展。
    政府统购棉纱的这一决定，确实是代表大多数人民的利益和要求。是打击少数投机商，稳定物价，安定人民生活不可缺少的措施。我们除了衷心拥护这个决定外，并以实际行动来积极生产响应这个决定。
