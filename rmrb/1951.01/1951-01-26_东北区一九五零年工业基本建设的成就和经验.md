　　Achievements and Experiences in Industrial Capital Construction in Northeast China in 1950
    The state-owned industrial capital construction in Northeast China in 1950 greatly expanded industrial equipment. Important experiences were gained in this work, pointing out the direction of efforts and improvements for this year's industrial capital construction.
    The state-owned industrial capital construction in Northeast China in 1950 was carried out with unprecedented enormous support from the state. The state's huge investment in Northeast China's industrial capital construction accounted for 40 percent of Northeast China's annual budget and 77 percent of Northeast China's total national economic investment. As of mid-December last year, the state had paid 90 percent of the total investment amount according to the plan. Adding the part of the investment transferred from the internal surplus accumulation of state-owned industries in Northeast China, the annual investment amount exceeded the original plan by 3.6 percent.
    State-owned industries in Northeast China used these investments to add a lot of industrial equipment, build many new factory buildings, warehouses, and workers' dormitories, extensively explore the underground resources of Northeast China, and purchase the instruments needed for industrial scientific research institutes. By the end of last year, the equipment capacity of most major industries in Northeast China had increased by 10 to 60 percent compared with the end of the previous year, and some had increased by 500 percent or more than 880 percent. A total of 2,448,556 square meters of factory buildings, warehouses, and employee welfare buildings were repaired and newly built in one year. Among them, employee residences and other facilities accounted for more than 1,570,000 square meters, which basically solved the difficulty of employee housing. The exploration of underground resources not only discovered more coal, iron, and copper deposits, but also newly discovered scheelite and nickel ore. The 8,000 new students enrolled in Northeast Institute of Technology, industrial colleges, and vocational schools at all levels have been conducting experiments with newly purchased scientific instruments.
    However, due to the lack of experience of industrial cadres in large-scale capital construction, many shortcomings also occurred in the industrial capital construction in Northeast China last year, resulting in waste of state funds and manpower.
    (1) Insufficient preparation and inadequate planning. Various industrial departments mostly proceeded from the rapid development of their own departments and put forward huge construction plans. They lacked detailed consideration of their own technical conditions, organizational capabilities, and equipment sources. Although these plans have been reviewed and reduced many times by leading organs, the shortcomings have not been completely overcome. One of the main shortcomings is that plans were put forward without investigating the situation of water sources, climate, soil, terrain, raw materials, and power supply, and some even started construction without drawing detailed construction drawings. Another is that they subjectively demanded to add a large number of equipment in a short period of time, without considering the possibility of adding equipment. Therefore, some projects could not be completed in time or were forced to stop due to the failure of equipment to arrive.
    (2) Not distinguishing between urgency and importance, and dispersing forces. For example, lacking detailed research on the purpose, function, and sequence of projects, some unnecessary, secondary, or deferrable projects were carried out. This not only hindered the rapid completion of major projects, but also made it impossible for some completed projects to be put into production. Another is that the ultimate goal of capital construction was ignored, which is to increase production capacity. Therefore, too much funds were invested in ancillary equipment such as warehouses, dormitories, and welfare buildings, which weakened the investment in production equipment.
    (3) The economic accounting system was not implemented. The phenomenon of no construction regulations, supervision system, technical norms, quality standards, and acceptance system was quite common, or it existed in form but was not strictly implemented. As a result, there was a backlog of raw materials, rework of projects, and waste of labor and management fees. The cost of buildings of the same quality sometimes differed by more than one time. The reason for this phenomenon, ideologically, is the influence of various forms of supply system thinking, and structurally, it is the direct leadership of production by administrative organizations instead of production organizations. As a result, on the one hand, it reduced the enthusiasm of administrative departments for strict inspection of projects, and on the other hand, it also reduced the sense of responsibility of production organizations.
    In addition, the distribution of designers to factories and mines to work not only wasted the already insufficient manpower, but also hindered the standardization of construction projects.
    In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government decided to implement the economic accounting system and clearly stipulate that the business of the capital construction departments and engineering companies or engineering teams of various industrial departments should be separated. All capital construction projects adopt the "contracted labor system," whereby the engineering company contracts for certain projects from the capital construction department. In order to effectively check the implementation of the state plan, the Industry Department also decided to strengthen the statistics work of capital construction. In order to grasp the preparation work of capital construction, the Industry Department requested the main responsible persons of capital construction in various departments to personally preside over and be responsible for putting forward the plan for the first quarter of preparation work; and report the situation to the Industry Department on a monthly basis. Training a large number of grassroots cadres and technicians for capital construction began last winter. Currently, Fushun, coal mines, power industry and other units have put forward training plans. The first phase of training is underway.

### 东北区一九五零年工业基本建设的成就和经验

　　东北区一九五零年工业基本建设的成就和经验
    东北区一九五零年国营工业的基本建设已使工业设备大为扩大。在这一工作中并取得了重要经验，为今年的工业基本建设指出了努力和改进的方向。
    一九五零年的东北国营工业基本建设是在国家空前巨大的支持下进行的。国家对东北工业基本建设的庞大投资，占东北全年预算的百分之四十，占东北全部国民经济投资总额百分之七十七。至去年十二月中旬止，国家已按计划支付了总投资额的百分之九十，如加上由东北国营工业内部超额积累转入投资的部分，全年投资额已超过原订计划百分之三点六。
    东北国营工业运用这些投资，添置了许多工业设备，建筑了许多新的厂房、仓库、工人宿舍，广泛地探勘了东北的地下富源，并购买了工业科学实验所需要的仪器。到去年年底，东北大部分主要工业的设备能力已比前年年底提高百分之十至百分之六十，有的提高百分之五百或百分之八百八十以上。一年中修复与新建的厂房、仓库及职工福利建筑，共达二百四十四万八千五百五十六平方公尺。其中职工住宅等占一百五十七万余平方公尺，基本上解决了职工住宅的困难。地下富源的探勘，不仅发现了更多煤、铁和铜的矿藏，而且新发现了白钨矿和镍矿。东北工业大学、工学院和各级职业学校新招收的八千名学生已用新添购的科学仪器进行实验。
    但是由于工业工作干部对大规模的基本建设缺乏经验，去年东北工业基本建设中也产生了不少缺点，造成国家资金和人力的浪费。
    （一）准备不够，计划不周。各工业部门多从本部门的迅速发展出发，提出了庞大的建设计划。他们对于本身的技术条件、组织能力和设备来源等都缺乏详细地考虑。这些计划虽曾经领导机关多次审定和削减，但其中缺点并没有完全克服。主要的一种缺点是没有考查水源、气候、土壤、地势、原料和电力供应的情形就提出计划，有的甚至没有绘好施工详图就施工。另一种是主观上要求在短期间内增添大量设备，而不考虑增添设备的可能性，因此某些工程因器材不能到达，不能及时完工或被迫停工。
    （二）不分缓急轻重，力量分散使用。如对工程的目的、作用和先后程序缺乏详细研究，以致进行了一些不十分必要的、次要的或可以推迟的工程。这样，不仅妨碍了主要工程迅速完成，也使有些已完工的工程无法进行生产。另一种是忽视了基本建设的最高目的是增加生产能力，因而把过多的资金投于仓库、宿舍、福利建筑等附属设备，削弱了生产设备的投资。
    （三）没有贯彻经济核算制。没有施工条例监工制度、技术定格、质量标准、验收制度的现象相当普遍，或者形式上有而未能严格执行。因而产生了原料积压，工程返工，人工和管理费的浪费。同一质量建筑物的成本，有的甚至相差一倍以上。产生这种现象的原因，在思想上，是各种形式的供给制思想的影响，在机构上，是行政组织代替生产组织而直接领导生产。结果，一方面降低了行政上对工程严格检查的积极性，另一方面便也降低了生产组织的责任心。
    此外设计人员分散在厂矿进行工作，不仅浪费了已感不足的人力，而且妨碍了建筑工程的标准化。
    为克服上述缺点，东北人民政府工业部决定贯彻经济核算制，明确规定把各工业部门的基本建设处和工程公司或工程队的业务分开。所有基本建设工程采取“包工合同制”办法，由工程公司向基本建设处承包一定的工程。工业部为有效地检查国家计划的执行情况，并决定加强基本建设的统计工作。工业部为抓紧基本建设的准备工作这一环节，要求各部基本建设的主要负责人，亲自主持并负责提出第一季度准备工作进行计划；并按月向工业部汇报情况。对于培养与训练大量基本建设的基层干部和技术工人，去冬即已着手进行。现抚顺、煤矿、电业等单位已提出了训练计划。第一期训练正在进行。
