Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th: Current affairs study and propaganda activities in the Central-South region's provinces and cities have expanded from large cities to small and medium-sized towns. Since late October, after cadres in various localities universally engaged in current affairs study, propaganda activities have been launched among organized masses. In Wuhan alone, 300,000 cadres, workers, students, and people from other social strata have participated in report sessions and discussions, while in Hunan, the number reached over 200,000. Currently, in large and medium-sized cities and some small towns in the Central-South region, "Branches of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression" have been established. Some district and township levels in counties and cities have also set up current affairs propaganda committees. Under the leadership of these organizations, workers, students, literary and art workers, and business circles in these large, medium-sized, and some small towns have convened mobilization rallies for resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding homes, and defending the country, and have held demonstrations. Teachers and students of church schools in Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Changsha are launching activities to expose the conspiracy and crimes of imperialists, headed by the United States, using church schools to engage in cultural aggression.

Various localities have organized and trained a large number of propagandists to go deep into the masses and carry out mass propaganda movements. Wuhan now has over a thousand propagandists scattered in various factories and schools. Labor models such as Liu Qiyu of the Hubei Reclamation Bureau, seaman model Li Dexin, and propagandists from the First Cotton Mill and the Universe Tobacco Factory use workers' meal times, breaks, or free time to report important current affairs news of the day to workers and peasants, and explain ideological issues that exist among the workers. Wuhan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi have organized a large number of students to participate in propaganda activities. In the Wuchang urban area, 20,000 people are conducting street propaganda. In the propaganda movement, various localities also adopt diverse propaganda forms based on local characteristics and specific audiences, such as accusation meetings, current affairs radio lectures, painting exhibitions, blackboard newspapers, reading groups, big-character posters, rhymes, local operas, rooftop broadcasts, peep shows, slideshows, and various recreational programs, to carry out propaganda. Some workers in Wuhan's First Cotton Mill did not know where Korea was in the past. After seeing the map and receiving explanations, they understood the relationship between China and Korea as being as close as lips and teeth, and immediately realized the necessity of aiding the Korean people. Workers and students from the Universe Tobacco Factory, Wuhan University, and Wuchang Experimental Middle School have all used their own experiences to accuse the atrocities of the U.S. military. Workers Zhang Fengchu and Chen Jinzhi accused the U.S. military of raping young Chinese girls in Kunming and Chengdu. This accusation aroused strong hatred for U.S. imperialism among all participants in the accusation meeting.

With the progress of the movement and the continuous victories in the Korean War, the awareness of the people in the Central-South region has gradually increased, and they are determined to use practical actions to strengthen national defense and support the Korean people. Currently, tens of thousands of workers and students have signed up to join various military schools. Under the slogan of "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the weapon," workers in factories in various localities have greatly improved production efficiency and strengthened security work. The production of a certain steel factory has increased more than five times. The Hubei Reclamation Bureau exceeded its production target by 20% in November. More than 40 safety groups have been established in eight factories in Nanchang, and more than 300 employees have joined the factory security squads, guarding the factory grounds and workshops day and night in shifts. Farmers in Guangdong, Hubei, and other places are actively paying public grain and storing it in warehouses to strengthen national defense. At present, the broad masses of people in the Central-South region are actively writing letters of sympathy, sewing comfort bags, and donating comfort money with great enthusiasm, preparing to dedicate these gifts to the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in the frozen wilderness to defend the motherland and world peace.

　　深入展开时事宣传
    中南组织训练宣传员
    【新华社汉口十日电】中南区各省、市的时事学习和时事宣传活动，已由大城市向中小城镇展开。十月下旬以来，各地工作干部普遍地进行时事学习后，宣传活动即在有组织的群众中展开；仅武汉市干部、工人、学生和其他阶层人民参加听报告、座谈的就有三十万人，湖南达二十多万人。现在中南区大城市及大部分中等城市和部分小城市，均成立了“中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会分会”，有些县、市的区乡和街坊也建立了时事宣传委员会。这些大、中城市和部分小城镇的工人、学生、文艺工作者和工商界，在上述组织领导下，已经分别召开抗美援朝保家卫国的动员大会，并曾举行示威游行。武汉、广州、长沙的教会学校师生，正在开展揭露以美国为首的帝国主义者利用教会学校从事文化侵略活动的阴谋罪行。
    各地曾组织与训练了大批宣传员，深入群众开展群众性的宣传运动。武汉市现已有一千多名宣传员散布在各工厂、学校。湖北农垦处劳动模范刘启宇、海员模范李德心及第一纱厂、宇宙烟厂的宣传员，都利用工人吃饭、休息或闲谈的时间，向工人农民们报告当天的重要时事消息，并针对工人中存在的思想问题，加以讲解。武汉、广东和江西组织了大批学生参加宣传活动。武昌市区有两万人进行街头宣传。各地在宣传运动中，还根据各地特点及具体对象，采用多种多样的宣传形式，如：控诉会、时事广播讲座、画展、黑板报、读报组、大字报、顺口溜、地方土戏、屋顶广播、拉洋片、幻灯及各种游艺节目等，进行宣传。武汉第一纱厂有些工人过去不知道朝鲜在那里，看到地图、再经过讲解以后，就明白中朝两国唇齿相依的关系，并立即认识到援助朝鲜人民的必要。宇宙烟厂、武汉大学及武昌实验中学的工人、学生，都以亲历亲见的事实控诉美军暴行。工人张凤初、陈金枝控诉了美军在昆明、成都强奸中国幼女的事件。这一控诉激起全体参加控诉会的人对美帝国主义的强烈的仇恨。
    随着运动的进展与朝鲜战事的节节胜利，中南区人民觉悟逐步提高，坚决以实际行动来充实国防力量与支援朝鲜人民。现在工人、学生报名参加各种军事学校的已有数万人。各地工厂工人在“工厂即战场、机器即武器”的口号下，生产效率大大提高，而且加强了保卫工作。某地钢铁工厂生产提高到五倍以上。湖北农垦处十一月超额完成生产百分之二十。南昌市八个工厂建立了四十多个安全小组，三百多个职工参加护厂纠察队，日夜轮班巡守厂院和车间。广东、湖北等地农民，正以积极缴纳公粮和入库来充实国防力量。目前中南区广大人民正以热烈的心情，积极进行写慰问信、缝慰问袋、捐献慰问金等活动，准备把这些礼物献给在冰天雪地中为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而战斗的中国人民志愿军。
