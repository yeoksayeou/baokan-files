　　The people and government love the troops and care for military families.
    A national Spring Festival support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-military-families campaign sweeps the country.
    [This newspaper reports] As the people across the nation joyfully celebrate the New Year of 1951 and welcome the Spring Festival, a warm campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to military families is unfolding. People's governments at all levels attach great importance to supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families during the New Year period. The Central and South Military and Political Committee, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Northeast People's Government, and the People's Governments of Henan, Fujian, Ningxia, Tianjin, Jinan and other provinces and cities have successively issued instructions on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families. The East China Military and Political Committee held a grand banquet on New Year's Day to entertain honored veterans and families of revolutionary martyrs. At the banquet, Chairman Rao Shushi of the East China Military and Political Committee proposed a toast to the health of the PLA soldiers, the wounded and sick, and the families of martyrs and military personnel. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government held a Spring Festival party on January 2 to comfort representatives of honored veterans, demobilized soldiers, and families of martyrs and military personnel, attended by more than 2,000 people. Deputy Mayor Pan, on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, extended high respect and cordial greetings to the families of martyrs and military personnel and honored veterans present at the meeting, and wished them a happy New Year. The people of Nanjing actively launched a campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to military families in various ways. Middle and primary school students in the city conducted street publicity while visiting the families of martyrs and military personnel, explaining the significance of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families to the citizens. Before the New Year, the people's governments of various districts in the city generally provided subsidies to families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers in need. People from all walks of life in Lishui, Suichang, Fenghua, Xiaoshan, Cixi and other counties in Zhejiang Province have also launched the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families. The people of Guichi, Shitai, Fanchang and other places in southern Anhui also comforted the families of martyrs, soldiers and revolutionary workers on New Year's Day. On New Year's Day, people from all walks of life in Guichi Chengguan voluntarily contributed more than 2.8 million yuan for army support. The commander of the Chizhou Military Sub-district, the commissioner of the Commissioner's Office, and the county magistrate of Guichi County all sent New Year's cards to the families of martyrs and military personnel on New Year's Day to express their condolences. Feng Zhongyun, chairman of Songjiang Province in Northeast China, personally led a delegation of people from all walks of life, carrying a large number of慰劳品(comfort items) to various cities and counties to visit honored veterans and the wounded and sick. In order to actively carry out the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, Xi'an City established a support-the-army committee on the 4th of this month, and designated the period from the 17th of this month to the 15th of February as "Support-the-Army Month," mobilizing people from all walks of life to donate materials and funds on a voluntary basis to comfort the troops stationed in the area, retired and demobilized soldiers, and the families of martyrs and military personnel during the Spring Festival. The People's Governments of Dunhua County in Jilin Province and Jiangdu County in northern Jiangsu Province held standing committee meetings of people's representatives or representative meetings of military families and honored veterans to specifically discuss how to implement the preferential treatment regulations issued by the Central Ministry of Internal Affairs and review the work of farming on behalf of military families in rural areas.
    Under the loving care of the government and the broad masses of the people, the families of martyrs and military personnel are deeply moved and have expressed their determination to improve production and encourage their sons to bravely kill the enemy and defend the country as a reward.
