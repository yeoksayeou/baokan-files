　　I Want to Work More Actively
　　—Letter from Liu Zidong, Model Worker of Southern Sichuan
　　Today, as we celebrate New Year's Day in 1951, I recall that three months ago, during the joyous celebration of the first anniversary of our People's Republic of China, I, along with outstanding worker representatives from all over the country, had the honor of meeting Chairman Mao in Beijing. Chairman Mao's smile and good health inspired every one of us workers. Every move of Chairman Mao is deeply etched in my mind. Looking back, it feels like just yesterday. To be able to see Chairman Mao just over a dozen months after the liberation of Southern Sichuan is truly the most glorious thing I will never forget in my life. I only regret that Southern Sichuan was liberated too late, and that I have done too little for the people in the past year. Recalling the days under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, I, like millions of worker brothers, felt as if I was living in hell. In 1925, I suffered from typhoid fever for twenty-eight consecutive days, and wanted to borrow some money from the factory to seek medical treatment. As a result, not only did I not get the loan, but I even lost my job. In 1948, while working at the pseudo “79th Army Repair Shop,” my child was critically ill, and I wanted to ask the director for an advance on my salary. Not only did I fail, but I was slapped twice. The suffering back then was truly endless. On the third day of the liberation of Luzhou, I knew that the day of liberation had arrived, and when else should I work hard if not now? I went to the homes of various worker brothers and called on everyone to return to work. When inventorying machines at the Erlangtan warehouse, we discovered that a working machine tool had been stolen by bad guys, so we chased it to the Lantianba "Air Transport Station" and carried it back. The pseudo-director Yi Mingxin stole a lot of equipment, preparing to escape to Chongqing. Deng Wenyu and I rushed to the Luzhou Military Control Commission overnight to report it, and as a result, Yi Mingxin and the grinding machine and telephone he stole were all recovered on the ship. Then, the repair shop started work, and I took the lead in all aspects of learning, production, and organizing the trade union. At my suggestion, the dilapidated machine tools in the shop were converted into wire drawing machines, increasing production by 50 percent. I also assisted Comrade Ren Youjian in converting the two-foot surface lathe into a three-dimensional drilling machine. Production efficiency increased by 60 percent. It was because of this small achievement that I was selected as a representative to attend the National Model Workers Conference and went to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. All of this proves that in the new society under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, even a little extra sweat and effort will not be buried. Now, I will definitely take the lead in responding to Chairman Mao's call to work more actively and strive to build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force.

　　我要更积极地工作
    —川南劳动模范刘子栋来信
    在欢度一九五一年元旦的今天，我想起了三个月前，正是咱们中华人民共和国诞生一周年的时候，在充满欢笑的北京，我和全国各地优秀的工人代表们一道，亲近地看见了毛主席。毛主席的笑容和健康的身体，鼓舞了我们每一个工人同志。毛主席的一举一动，都深深地印在我的脑子里。回想起来，好像就是昨天的事。我能在川南解放十几个月以后，就看见了毛主席，真是我一生忘不了的最光荣的事情。我只恨川南解放太晚，我一年来为人民做的事情太少了。回想在蒋匪统治时期，我也像千万工人兄弟们一样，好像生活在地狱里。一九二五年，我一连生了二十八天的伤寒病，想向厂里借一点钱医病。结果不但没借到，连饭碗都给打碎了。一九四八年在伪“七十九军修理所”做工时，娃儿病得半死，想向所长借支一点工资，事情没成功反而挨了两下耳光。那时候的苦，真是诉也诉不完。泸州解放的第三天，我就知道翻身的日子到来了，不积极工作还待什么时候。我到各工人兄弟的家里，叫大家回来工作。在二郎滩仓库清点机器时，发觉一部工作母机被坏家伙们搬走了，我们便追到蓝田坝“航空转运站”去抬回来。伪所长易明新偷了很多器材，准备逃到重庆去，我和邓文玉连夜赶到泸州军管会去报告，结果在轮船上将易明新和他偷去的砂轮机和电话机等全部追回来。接着修械所开工了，在学习、生产和组织工会各方面我都带头干。经过我的提议，把所里破烂的机床改成拉线机，增加产量百分之五十。我又协助任有鉴同志，把平面二尺车床改为立体钻床。生产效率提高百分之六十。就由于这一点小成绩，我被选为列席全国劳模大会的代表，到北京去见毛主席。这一切，证明了在共产党和毛主席领导下的新社会，多出一点汗多使一下劲都不会被埋没。现在，我一定带头响应毛主席号召，更积极工作，为建设强大的国防军和建设强大的经济力量而努力。
