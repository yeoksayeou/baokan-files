Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Vietnam News Agency reported: Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong gave a brief report on the action program of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for 1951 at a press conference on January 3. He said: "In 1951, we must continue the work that began at the beginning of last year, that is, to mobilize the entire Vietnamese people to step up preparations for the early general counter-offensive. The action program of the Vietnamese People's Government for 1951 has the following nine points:

\t1. In the military field: Develop our armed forces and give the enemy greater blows. That is, develop our main force, develop and consolidate our people's army local forces, launch larger battles, and expand guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear.

\t2. In the domestic political field: Further consolidate the unity of the Vietnamese people in accordance with the policies formulated by the People's Government. Strengthen the Vietnam National United Front; this national united front will be fully realized when the Viet Lien and Viet Minh are completely merged in 1951. Strengthen the People's Congress and the People's Committee, and improve the government organizations at the village and central levels. Develop the people's criticism of cadres and government agencies. Step up the movement to eliminate puppet organizations and further consolidate the people's democratic regime.

\t3. In the diplomatic field: Further strengthen our diplomatic relations with friendly countries; unite with the people of Laos and Cambodia, and help them carry out the struggle for national liberation and develop people's diplomacy.

\t4. In the economic field: Formulate a plan to step up production in order to continue our war of liberation and improve the people's living standards. Such a plan must guarantee the interests of both the government and private individuals, and adjust labor-capital relations. The primary purpose of our production plan is to meet the increasing needs of the military and improve the living conditions of the people. We must thoroughly and correctly implement our land policy, such as reducing rent and interest, and temporarily distributing land and real estate formerly belonging to imperialists and traitors to poor farmers. Develop trade and small industries. Pay greater attention to transportation and traffic issues.

\t5. In the financial field: Rationalize the people's burden, establish a national bank, adjust the monetary system, and implement corporatization, so as to reform our financial system.

\t6. In the cultural field: Complete the implementation of the new education plan; promote mass education; develop vocational schools, cultural supplementary classes, people's health organizations, and relief work for disabled and retired soldiers.

\t7. Carry out construction work in the newly liberated areas, with the aim of turning these areas into bases for resistance.

\t8. Improve work organization and work style, so as to eradicate bureaucracy. Strengthen the cooperation between the people, the army, and the government, and strengthen the connection between the central government and local government agencies.

\t9. Intensify the patriotic competition movement throughout the country, especially in the army, villages, factories, and government agencies, and improve the level of organization and leadership."

Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said: "To realize this program, an important issue to be resolved is to unify the cadre system in all aspects, especially in terms of improvement and education."

    【新华社十九日讯】越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国政府副总理范文同一月三日在记者招待会上，曾就越南人民政府一九五一年的行动纲领作了扼要的报告。他说：“一九五一年我们要继续进行去年年初所开始的工作，即动员整个越南人民加紧早日总反攻的准备工作。越南人民政府一九五一年的行动纲领有以下九点：

    四、经济方面：拟定一个加紧生产的计划，以继续进行我们的解放战争和提高人民生活水准。这样的计划必须保证政府与私人双方的利益，并调整劳资关系。我们生产计划的首要目的，是要适应军队方面日益增加的需要，并改进人民的生活条件。我们要彻底而正确地执行我们的土地政策，例如减租减息，暂时将以前属于帝国主义者与卖国贼的土地与不动产等分配给贫农。发展贸易与小工业。对运输与交通问题加以更大的注意。
    五、财政方面：使人民的负担合理化，筹设国家银行，调整货币制度，实行企业化等，借以改革我们的财政制度。
    六、文化方面：完成新教育计划的实现；推行民众教育；发展职业学校、文化补习班、人民卫生团体与残废退休军人的救济工作。
    七、在新解放区进行建设工作，目的是要使这些区域变成抗战的根据地。
    八、改进工作组织与工作作风，借以根绝官僚主义。紧密人民、军队、与政府间的合作，加强中央政府与地方政府机关间的联系。
    九、在全国特别是在军队、乡村、工厂与政府机关里加紧进行爱国主义的竞赛运动，提高组织与领导工作的水平”。
    副总理范文同说：“要实现这一纲领，所要解决的重要问题是从各方面统一干部制度，特别是在提高和教育方面。”
