Xinhua News Agency: The emerging Chinese people's film industry has been developing rapidly with a vigorous posture in the past year, and has achieved brilliant achievements in production, distribution, and other aspects. By late December, the three film studios under the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government (hereinafter referred to as the Central Film Bureau) in Northeast China, Beijing, and Shanghai had overfulfilled their annual production tasks. They had produced 26 feature films, 1 animated film, 18 documentaries, 62 "New China Briefs", dubbed 43 Soviet feature films, and dubbed 42 Soviet educational films. In order to make films accessible to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Central Film Bureau assisted various military units, factories, cultural and educational institutions in training 600 film projection teams. American films that poisoned the Chinese people have now been basically eliminated from the Chinese film market.

China's people's film industry is still in its early stages, but thanks to the dedication of thousands of people's film workers who wholeheartedly serve the people and resolutely overcome many difficulties, they have finally successfully completed the unprecedentedly huge film production task in 1950.

The feature films completed in the past year, produced by Northeast Film Studio, include: "Zhao Yiman," "Glorious Family," "Steel Warrior," "Defend the Country and Protect the Home," "Red Flag Song," "Distant Countryside," "Liu Hulan," "Marching Forward with Great Strides," "The White-Haired Girl," "Great Battle," "Who Deserves the Honor," "Red Fighters," and 13 other films. Beijing Film Studio produced: "Heroes of Lüliang," "March of Democratic Youth," "Toward New China," "New Children's Heroes," "Northern Shaanxi Pastoral Song," and 5 other films. Shanghai Film Studio produced: "Farmhouse Joy," "The Earth Regains its Light," "Unite Until Tomorrow," "Storm on the Sea," "Geng Hailin Returns Home," "Green Hill Red Flag," "Shangrao Concentration Camp," "Female Driver," and 8 other films.

The documentaries completed in the past year, produced by Beijing Film Studio, include: "Red Flags Sweep the Northwest," "New Dalian and Lushun of the People," "Triumphant Song of the Great Southwest," "Story of a Prostitute's Liberation," "Gods and Ghosts are Powerless," "Battle of Hainan Island," "Road to Victory," "Yellow Sea Fishermen," "Children's Marriage," "Universal Celebration," "Unity is Strength," "Production Front," "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities," "Defenders of Peace," "Strike Aggressors," and 15 other films. Beijing Film Studio also jointly produced the color documentaries "Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China" with Soviet film workers. Shanghai Film Studio produced the documentary "New People's Village."

In addition, Northeast Film Studio also dubbed 32 Soviet feature films such as "The Fall of Berlin," "The Battle of Stalingrad," "Happy Life," "They Have a Motherland." Beijing Film Studio filmed most of the "New China Briefs" and dubbed 42 Soviet educational films. Shanghai Film Studio filmed an animated film including three themes: "Thank You Little Kitten," "Peace Song," "Little Iron Pillar" and a portion of "New China Briefs," and dubbed 11 Soviet feature films such as "Peach and Plum Fill the World," "Michurin."

The films produced by the Chinese people's film workers mostly depict the heroism and patriotism of the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers in revolutionary struggles and production and construction. These films, with a neo-realistic artistic direction, show the glorious victories of New China and the new characters of China. Some of these films that have already been publicly released have not only been loved by the vast domestic audience, but also welcomed by the vast progressive people internationally. The film "Daughters of China," made in 1949, attracted hundreds of thousands of viewers in every major city in China. It was universally praised in the Soviet Union, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. The film also won the fourth prize, the "Freedom Struggle Award," at the Fifth International Film Festival. "Victory of the Chinese People" has been viewed by more than three million people in China.

With the assistance of the Central Film Bureau, China's private film companies also produced many films in 1950, among which "Ideological Problem" and "Corrosion" by Wenhua Film Company, and "People's Giant Palm" by Kunlun Film Company are relatively good works.

Most of the films shot by Chinese people's film workers in 1950 will be released successively throughout the country in the spring of 1951 and will be distributed abroad separately.

The distribution work of the Chinese people's film industry began by facing the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. At the end of 1949, there were about 100 film projection teams in the country. In 1950, the Central Film Bureau assisted the various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, local trade unions, local cultural and educational institutions, and local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in training more than 1,800 staff members for 600 film projection teams. These trainees came from all provinces, regions, and cities across the country except Tibet and Taiwan, including nine ethnic groups: Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Uyghur, Uzbek, Tatar, Miao, and Yi. After four months of training, they have all been able to skillfully master film projection technology. Now, the 600 projection teams have taken new films and penetrated into the military units, factories, mines, and rural areas across the country. In addition to touring with films, the projection teams are also using slide shows and photo exhibitions to extensively carry out the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda activities.

The various film management companies and offices under the Central Film Bureau have negotiated with local cinemas over the past year to achieve a unified film scheduling method, uniting public and private cinemas, opposing American and British films containing toxins and old films produced domestically, and helping them solve the problem of film shortages, so that their business has gradually improved; at the same time, they have also strived for more audiences for progressive films. At the end of 1949, in areas other than the Northeast, American and British films and old domestic films still accounted for the majority of the audience. By the first half of 1950, the audience for these toxic films had been reduced to 32 percent of the total domestic film audience, and it was even less in the second half of the year.

Before liberation, due to the cultural aggression of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government's efforts to restrict the opening and screening of progressive films, the Chinese film market was basically monopolized by American films. These reactionary, obscene, and thieving American films seriously poisoned the minds of Chinese audiences. Since the successive liberation of various places, the vast audience has been exposed to Chinese people's films and Soviet films; the progressive and healthy content of these films has had a great impact on the audience, and the audience's political awareness has gradually improved in the new society's life and study, all of which have automatically abandoned American films. The Northeast region stopped screening American films as early as 1949. In February 1950, the Beijing Cinema Association voluntarily refused to show American films to support the anti-bombing struggle in Shanghai; cities such as Tianjin also responded successively, and North China also expelled American films from then on. The audience for American films in Shanghai gradually declined in 1950, from 909,000 in March, accounting for 52.4 percent of the total number of film viewers in the city, to 270,000 in September, accounting for only 14 percent of the total audience. In October 1950, after the anti-American and aid-Korea movement was launched in various places, the vast audience clearly realized that American films were one of the tools of imperialist aggression, and refused to watch American films one after another. Schools and factories in Shanghai and film industry personnel in Shanghai and North China held symposiums to denounce the poison of American films and expose the crimes of American films. In early November, the Guangzhou film industry officially refused to show American films; then Shanghai newspapers refused to publish advertisements for American films. In the first half of November, the audience for American films in Shanghai had been reduced to 47,000, less than one-tenth of the total film audience. From November 14, 40 cinemas in Shanghai accepted the requirements of the vast audience and unanimously refused to show American films. American films, which had poisoned Chinese audiences for 25 years, were thus driven out of the Chinese film market. Because the vast audience has generally recognized the toxicity of American films, after the suspension of American films in various places, the total number of all film audiences has not only not decreased, but has increased in many cases. For example, in the second half of November, the total number of film audiences in Shanghai increased by 12.3 percent compared with the first half of the month. In December, when Shanghai screened films such as "The Fall of Berlin," "Defend the Country and Protect the Home," and "People's Giant Palm," the number of viewers surged. Under the enthusiastic welcome of the vast audience and the concerted efforts of the people's film workers, a broad and bright road is unfolding in front of the Chinese people's film industry.

　　中国人民电影事业一年来的光辉成就
    【新华社讯】新兴的中国人民电影事业，一年来正以茁壮的姿态迅速地发展着，在制作、发行等方面都获得了光辉的成就。到十二月下旬，中央人民政府文化部电影局（以下简称中央电影局）所属的东北、北京、上海三个制片厂，已超额完成全年的生产任务，摄制成了故事片二十六部，美术片一部，纪录片十八部，新中国简报六十二部，翻译苏联故事片四十三部，翻译苏联教育片四十二部。为了使电影面向广大的工农兵，中央电影局协助各部队、工厂及文教机关等训练了六百个电影放映队。毒害中国人民的美国电影片，现在已基本上从中国电影市场上被肃清。
    中国的人民电影事业至今仍处在一个年青的阶段，但由于数千个人民电影工作者，以全心全意为人民服务的精神，坚决地克服了许多困难，终于胜利地完成了一九五○年空前庞大的制片任务。
    一年来已完成的故事片，由东北制片厂摄制的有：“赵一曼”、“光荣人家”、“钢铁战士”、“卫国保家”、“红旗歌”、“辽远的乡村”、“刘胡兰”、“高歌猛进”、“白毛女”、“伟大的战斗”、“荣誉属于谁”、“红色战斗员”等十三部；由北京制片厂摄制的有：“吕梁英雄”、“民主青年进行曲”、“走向新中国”、“新儿女英雄传”、“陕北牧歌”等五部；由上海制片厂摄制的有：“农家乐”、“大地重光”、“团结起来到明天”、“海上风暴”、“耿海林回家”、“翠岗红旗”、“上饶集中营”、“女司机”等八部。
    一年来已完成的纪录片，由北京制片厂摄制的有：“红旗漫卷西风”、“人民新旅大”、“大西南凯歌”、“烟花女儿翻身记”、“神鬼不灵”、“大战海南岛”、“胜利之路”、“黄海渔民”、“儿女亲事”、“普天同庆”、“团结就是力量”、“生产战线”、“中国民族大团结”、“和平保卫者”、“打击侵略者”等十五部。北京制片厂并与苏联电影工作者联合摄制了“中国人民的胜利”和“解放了的中国”两部五彩纪录片。由上海制片厂摄制的纪录片有“新人村”一部。
    此外，东北制片厂还翻译了“攻克柏林”、“斯大林格勒战役”、“幸福生活”、“他们有祖国”等苏联故事片三十二部；北京制片厂拍摄了大部分的新中国简报并翻译了苏联教育片四十二部；上海制片厂拍摄了一部美术片包括“谢谢小花猫”、“和平歌”、“小铁柱”等三个主题和一部分新中国简报，并翻译了“桃李满天下”、“米丘林”等十一部苏联故事片。
    中国人民电影工作者所拍摄的影片，绝大部分的内容是描写中国工农兵群众在革命斗争和生产建设中的英雄主义与爱国主义精神的。这些影片以新现实主义的艺术方向表现了新中国的辉煌的胜利和中国的新人物。这些影片中已经公开放映的一部分不仅受到国内广大观众的热爱，也受到国际间广大进步人民的欢迎。一九四九年拍成的“中华女儿”一片在国内每个大城市上映时观众都有数十万；在苏联、朝鲜、捷克等国家受到普遍的赞誉。该片并获得第五届国际电影节的第四奖，即“自由斗争奖”。“中国人民的胜利”在国内已有观众三百万以上。
    在中央电影局的协助下，中国的私营电影公司在一九五○年内也摄制了不少的影片，其中文华公司的“思想问题”、“腐蚀”，昆仑公司的“人民的巨掌”，都是比较好的作品。
    中国人民电影工作者在一九五○年所拍摄的影片，大部分将在一九五一年春天陆续在全国各地放映，并将分别向国外发行。
    中国人民电影事业的发行工作，一开始就是面对着广大的工农兵的。一九四九年底，全国约有放映队一百队。一九五○年，中央电影局又协助中国人民解放军各部队、各地工会、各地文教机关、各地中苏友好协会训练了六百个放映队的工作人员一千八百多名。这些受训人员来自除西藏、台湾以外的全国各省、区、市，包括汉、满、蒙、回、维吾尔、乌兹别克、塔塔尔、苗、夷等九个民族，经过四个月的训练，他们都已能熟练地掌握电影放映技术。现在六百个放映队，已携带新片分别深入到全国的部队、厂矿、农村中去。各放映队目前除以影片巡回放映外；并将利用幻灯及照片展览等形式，广泛地展开抗美援朝的宣传活动。
    中央电影局所属各影片经理公司和办事处，一年来与各地影院协商，取得统一排片的办法，团结了公私营影院，反对含有毒素的美英影片和国内摄制的旧影片，并帮助他们解决了片荒的问题，使其营业逐渐好转；同时也为进步影片争取了更多的观众。在一九四九年底，全国各地除东北外，美英影片和国内旧影片的观众还占多数，到一九五○年的上半年，这些有毒素影片的观众减至国内全部电影观众的百分之三十二，下半年则更为减少。
    在解放以前，由于美帝国主义的文化侵略和国民党反动政府极力限制进步电影的开拍与上映。当时中国的电影市场基本上是为美国影片所垄断的。这些反动的、诲淫诲盗的美国影片，在思想上严重地毒害了中国观众。自各地相继解放后，广大的观众接触到了中国人民电影和苏联影片；这些影片的进步、健康的内容给观众以极大的影响，再加观众在新社会的生活和学习中政治觉悟逐步提高，都自动地唾弃了美国影片。东北地区在一九四九年就已不再放映美国影片。一九五○年二月，北京电影院公会为支援上海反轰炸斗争，自动拒映美国影片；天津等城市也相继响应，从此华北地区也驱除了美国影片。上海市美国影片的观众在一九五○年是逐渐下降的，三月份为九十万九千，占全市电影观众总数的百分之五十二点四，九月份就下降为二十七万，仅占观众总数的百分之十四。一九五○年十月，抗美援朝运动在各地展开后，广大的观众已清楚地认识到美国影片是帝国主义的侵略工具之一，纷纷拒看美国影片。上海的各学校工厂以及上海、华北的电影业人士都分别地举行了控诉美国影片毒害的座谈会，揭露美国影片的罪恶。十一月初广州电影业正式拒映美国影片；接着上海各报拒登美国影片广告，十一月上半月上海美国影片观众已减至四万七千人，不及全部电影观众的十分之一。十一月十四日起上海四十家电影院接受广大观众的要求，一律拒映美国影片。毒害了中国观众达二十五年之久的美国影片，于此便从中国的电影市场，被驱除出去。由于广大的观众已普遍认识了美国影片的毒害性，在各地停映美国影片以后，全部电影观众的总数不但未减少，且多有增加。如上海十一月下半月全部电影观众比上半月增加百分之十二点三。十二月上海放映“攻克柏林”、“卫国保家”、“人民的巨掌”等影片时，观众数目激增。在广大观众的热烈欢迎和人民电影工作者的一致努力下，中国人民电影事业前面正展开一条宽阔的光明的道路。
