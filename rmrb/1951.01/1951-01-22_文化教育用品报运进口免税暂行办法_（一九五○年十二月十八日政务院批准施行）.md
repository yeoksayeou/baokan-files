    (Approved and Implemented by the Government Administration Council on December 18, 1950)

    1.  These provisional measures shall apply to tax exemption applications for cultural and educational supplies ordered from abroad for self-use or accepted as donations from abroad by public and registered private schools, cultural and educational institutions and organizations (hereinafter referred to as cultural and educational institutions).

    2.  The following items of cultural and educational supplies shall be exempt from import tax under these measures:
    (1) Books, periodicals, and charts;
    (2) Specimens, models, and language recordings;
    (3) Scientific experimental instruments, apparatus, and their parts;
    (4) Chemicals and medical research experimental materials;
    (5) Seeds, seedlings, and breeding livestock specifically for variety improvement experiments;
    (6) Educational films, slides, and art supplies.

    3.  Before importing purchased cultural and educational supplies, cultural and educational institutions shall, in addition to applying for an import license from the foreign trade administration authority at the port of entry in accordance with the foreign trade management regulations, prepare a detailed list of goods in quadruplicate, specifying the name, quantity, weight, value, purpose, and country of origin of the supplies. This list shall be submitted to the directly subordinate leading organs of the Central Government or the Greater Administrative Area People's Governments or Military and Administrative Committees for review, approval, signature, and stamping. One copy shall be retained by the approving authority for reference, and three copies shall be sent to the General Administration of Customs for review and decision on whether to levy taxes. If the reported items are consistent with the tax-exempt items stipulated in Article 2 of these provisional measures, one copy shall be issued to the applicant along with a tax exemption certificate for customs clearance; the remaining two copies shall be used, one sent to the customs at the port of entry along with the tax exemption certificate notification, and one retained by the General Administration of Customs for reference.

    4.  Before importing cultural and educational supplies donated from abroad, cultural and educational institutions shall prepare a list of goods in quadruplicate as stipulated in the preceding article, along with relevant donation documents, and submit them to the Government Administration Council or the Cultural and Educational Committees of the Greater Administrative Areas for review, approval, signature, and stamping. One copy shall be retained by the approving authority for reference, and three copies shall be sent to the General Administration of Customs for review and decision on whether to levy taxes. If the reported items are consistent with the tax-exempt items stipulated in Article 2 of these measures, they shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article.

    5.  For cultural and educational supplies that are verified to be consistent with the documents and are approved for tax exemption, the local customs shall release them tax-free upon presentation of the tax exemption certificate issued by the General Administration of Customs. Items listed in the documents but not within the tax-exempt scope stipulated in these measures, and for which no special tax exemption has been granted, shall be released after taxes are levied in accordance with regulations. In cases of discrepancies between documents and goods or alterations and deceptions, the local customs shall handle the matter in accordance with regulations and report it to the General Administration of Customs for verification and record.

    6.  For imported cultural and educational supplies that have been exempted from customs duties, if they were originally subject to goods tax and local surcharges, they shall also be exempted. However, the applicant shall submit the goods tax declaration form, with the tax exemption endorsed by the customs, to the local tax bureau for stamping as verified, and it shall accompany the goods for inspection.

    7.  If tax-exempt imported cultural and educational supplies are later sold or used for profit-making purposes, the original applicant cultural and educational institution shall notify the original port of entry customs to pay the taxes in accordance with regulations. Violators shall be treated as smugglers.

    8.  The list of goods and tax exemption certificate submitted by the applicant to the customs for inspection shall be stamped and canceled by the port of entry customs after the goods are released. The list of goods shall be returned to the applicant for receipt, and the tax exemption certificate shall be returned by the port of entry customs to the General Administration of Customs for cancellation.

Experts dispatched abroad or invited back to China by government agencies or organizations, and students studying abroad in specialized fields at colleges or above who bring back cultural and educational supplies for personal use that comply with the provisions of Article 2 of these provisional measures, and who hold documents sufficient to prove their identity from the dispatching or inviting agency or the foreign school, shall be granted tax-free release after inspection by the local customs.

    11. These provisional measures shall be formulated by the General Administration of Customs, submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for review and transfer to the Government Administration Council for approval before implementation; the same shall apply to amendments.
