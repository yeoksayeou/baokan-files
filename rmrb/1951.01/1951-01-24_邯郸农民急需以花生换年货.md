　　邯郸 Farmers urgently need peanuts to exchange for New Year goods

Editor:
    Handan has a lot of sandy land, and the masses are accustomed to planting peanuts. Many farmers benefited from planting peanuts in 1949, and planted even more last year, resulting in a bumper harvest. The total peanut production in the county is about 5.7 million jin. However, this year the sales of peanuts and peanut oil are sluggish. In the past, state-owned trading agencies and cooperatives did not carry out procurement and organize sales. As a result, the price of peanuts has fallen from 95,000 yuan per 100 jin at the beginning to the current 78,000 yuan. Occasionally, peddlers come to the countryside to buy, and farmers rush to sell. In addition to using them for paying public grain, self-use, and retail, farmers still have half of the total output unsold, and it is estimated that there are currently 2.6 million to 3 million jin of peanuts in the county. The storage of such a large number of peanuts affects the lives and production of farmers. Some farmers, because they cannot sell peanuts, take them to exchange for peanut cakes to eat. More farmers have difficulty celebrating the New Year because they cannot sell peanuts.
    The Handan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County Government convened a meeting of village cadres on January 10 to discuss the export of cotton and peanuts. It was decided to purchase 200,000 jin of peanuts from farmers and cooperative members on credit (actual storage) in January, and a contract was signed with the trading company to purchase 40,000 jin of peanut kernels (equivalent to 60,000 jin of peanut fruit). Private merchants and peddlers were also mobilized to transport peanuts out and exchange them for daily necessities needed by farmers. But this still cannot solve the problems of the masses. The reasons are: (1) The credit purchase (actual storage) requires a minimum of one month to pay, but there are only 20 days left before the Spring Festival, which cannot meet the needs of farmers for the Spring Festival; (2) The total amount of peanuts currently stored by farmers in the county is 3 million jin, and the amount purchased is far from the needs of the masses; (3) Mobilizing private merchants and peddlers for export is also limited, and it may be difficult to completely solve the needs of the masses.
    Based on the above situation, we put forward the following suggestions: (1) The credit purchase (actual storage) period should be as flexible as possible or shortened, and a portion of the payment can be made first or some of the necessities for the New Year can be given to the masses first according to their needs; (2) Expand the purchase figures and plan to purchase the peanuts that are most urgently needed to be sold first; (3) Supply and marketing cooperatives can vigorously open up sales in neighboring counties or further places, or systematically mobilize oil mills to make oil, so that the oil needed by the masses for the New Year is also available, and some peanuts can also be sold.

    Editor's Note: How to promote agricultural products and supply farmers with necessities is indeed a very important issue. It is good that the leaders of Handan County attach great importance to this, and they should further assist the supply and marketing cooperatives to find ways to promote sales to other places. According to our investigation with relevant departments, the Oil and Fat Company under the Central Trade Department has allocated a considerable amount of funds to Hebei Province to purchase peanuts from farmers through local cooperatives and state-owned trading companies. If it is felt that the amount currently purchased is too small to meet the needs of farmers, the local state-owned company can report to the higher authorities and appropriately expand the purchase amount. At the same time, in order to better meet the needs of farmers to exchange for goods needed for the New Year, local state-owned companies can study and implement linked operations according to their own business plans - that is, hand over the peanuts of farmers to the Oil and Fat Company, without taking cash, but taking department stores to the department store with certain procedures, or taking other materials to other companies. In this way, some purchase problems can be solved even when funds are insufficient.

### 邯郸农民急需以花生换年货

　　邯郸农民急需以花生换年货编辑同志：
    邯郸沙地很多，群众惯于种花生，许多农民因在一九四九年种花生得利，去年种的更多，而且丰收。全县花生产量约有五百七十万斤。而今年花生和花生油销路不畅，过去国营贸易机关和合作社也未进行收购和组织推销，因此花生价格下跌，由起初每百斤九万五千元降至目前七万八千元，偶有小贩到农村收买，农民都抢着卖。农民除用以交公粮、自用和零售一部分外，还剩有总产量的一半无法售出，估计全县现存有花生二百六十万斤到三百万斤。这样大批花生的存放，就影响到农民的生活和生产。有的农民因花生卖不出去，就拿去换花生豆饼当饭吃。更多的农民因花生卖不出，过年很困难。
    邯郸中共县委和县府曾于一月十日召开了全县村干会议，讨论了棉花和花生的外销问题。决定一月份赊购（存实）农民及合作社社员花生二十万斤，并和贸易公司订立了合同收购花生仁四万斤（合花生果六万斤）。并发动私商小贩运出花生换回农民所需日用品。但这样仍不能解决群众的问题。原因是：（一）赊购（存实）最低要一月限期才能付款，但目前离春节年关只有二十天，不能应农民春节的需要；（二）全县农民现存花生三百万斤，而收购数距群众要求相差太远；（三）发动私商小贩外销，也是有限度的，恐难完全解决群众的要求。
    就以上情况我们提出几点建议：（一）赊购（存实）期限应该尽量灵活或缩短期限，并可根据群众需要先交一部分款或先交给群众一些年关的必需用品；（二）扩大收购数字，并应有计划的先收购最迫切需要出售的花生；（三）供销社可到邻县或较远的地方大力打开销路或有计划的发动油坊打油，这样使群众年关需要的油也有了，花生也可以销售一部分。

    编者按：如何推销农产及供给农民以必需品确是一个很重要的问题。邯郸县领导上对此很重视是很好的，应进一步协助供销社多方设法向外地推销。另据我们向有关部门调查，中央贸易部所属油脂公司，曾对河北省拨出相当数量的款项，通过当地合作社和国营贸易公司，收购农民的花生。如感到现在所收购的数目太少，不能满足农民需要，则可由当地国营公司呈报上级，适当扩大收购数目。同时，为更好的满足农民交换过年所需要的物资，当地各国营公司可根据自己的经营计划，研究实行连环业务——即将农民花生交油脂公司，不取现款，而凭一定手续到百货公司取百货，或到其他公司取其他物资。这样在资金不足时也可解决一部分收购问题。
