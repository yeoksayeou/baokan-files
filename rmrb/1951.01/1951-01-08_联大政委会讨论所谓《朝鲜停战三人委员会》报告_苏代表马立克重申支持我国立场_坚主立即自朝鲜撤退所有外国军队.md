Xinhua News Agency, New York, 7th. (TASS, New York, 4th) The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on January 3rd. There were three items on the agenda: the so-called "Three-Man Committee" report on the Korean War issue, the Soviet Union's accusation against the United States of aggression against China, and the so-called "Formosa issue."

    Indian representative Rau presented what he called a "purely factual report" on the activities of the "Korean Armistice Three-Man Committee."

    Rau explained the "Three-Man Committee's" proposed recommendations regarding "armistice" conditions, one of which advocated establishing a demilitarized zone spanning Korea, approximately twenty miles in depth, with the 38th parallel as its southern boundary. Rau concluded by saying: "The Three-Man Committee" is currently unable to offer any recommendations. Rau's report cited the reply from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to the telegram from the "Three-Man Committee," which had requested the Chinese government to instruct Wu Xiuquan to negotiate with the "Three-Man Committee." The reply pointed out that the representative of the People's Republic of China did not participate in or agree to the resolution of the so-called "Korean Armistice Three-Man Committee" passed by the United Nations General Assembly. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that all major resolutions of the United Nations that have been passed without the participation and agreement of the legitimate representative of the People's Republic of China, especially major resolutions related to Asia, are considered illegal by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and are invalid. Therefore, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China cannot order its representative, General Wu Xiuquan, to continue to stay at Lake Success to hold negotiations with the aforementioned illegal "Three-Man Committee." After the Security Council unreasonably rejected the People's Republic of China's accusation against the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan, Wu Xiuquan once again obeyed the order of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to continue to stay at Lake Success, preparing to participate in the discussion of the "accusation against the United States of aggression against China" proposed by the Soviet representative. Although he waited for a long time, the United Nations General Assembly has already adjourned, and he still has not been given the opportunity to speak. Under these circumstances, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that it is no longer necessary for General Wu Xiuquan and his staff to stay at Lake Success, and has ordered General Wu Xiuquan and others to depart for home on the 19th of this month. Regarding the question of how the United Nations should make contact with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the United Nations should directly inquire of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    Rau also spoke about the statement made by the Government of the People's Republic of China on December 22 regarding the "Three-Man Committee" issue.

    The next speaker was Soviet representative Malik, who recounted that the Soviet Union had opposed the establishment of the "Three-Man Committee," and stated: It is now clear that the Anglo-American bloc is attempting to use the ceasefire to force the General Assembly to accept measures that will enable them to continue their armed aggression against Korea. Various official statements and news reports indicate that the United States is not seeking a peaceful resolution, but is striving to push forward its hopeless adventure in Korea. Recent developments in the United States, such as the declaration of a national emergency, economic mobilization, intensified war hysteria, accelerated rearmament, and the aggressive speeches by Truman and Acheson, all confirm this.

    Malik then cited numerous pieces of evidence regarding American hostility towards the People's Republic of China, including the bombing of Chinese territory, the forcible occupation of Taiwan, and the obstruction of China's participation in the United Nations, etc.

    Malik continued, Zhou Enlai clearly stated the basic conditions for a peaceful resolution in the statement he issued on December 22 regarding the establishment of the "Three-Man Committee" (which the rapporteur did not read out). Malik pointed out that the Soviet delegation, in support of the position of the People's Republic of China, had put forward a proposal advocating the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, allowing the Korean people to decide their own future. Malik strongly urged the immediate passage of the Soviet proposal, saying that only by taking such a step could the United Nations General Assembly open the door to a constructive solution.

    Next, Malik informed the Political Committee of new evidence received since the last meeting regarding atrocities committed by the American and South Korean troops. Malik mentioned the third report issued by the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front on December 26. After detailing the brutal massacres of Korean residents and the destruction of Korean public buildings, Malik said that the cruel acts of the American and Syngman Rhee troops have aroused public indignation throughout the world. Finally, Malik said that the Soviet delegation had a short documentary film recording the barbarous acts of the United States in Korea, and formally suggested that the Political Committee watch the film.

    Peruvian representative Belaunde requested that Zhou Enlai's statement issued on December 22 be read out—this statement had already been published as an appendix to the "Three-Man Committee" report—because Malik had pointed out that the Political Committee had ignored this statement. The chairman of the Political Committee agreed with the Peruvian representative's opinion, and Zhou Enlai's statement was then read out.

    American representative Austin vehemently attacked the People's Republic of China, continuing to baselessly accuse it of conducting "aggression" in Korea. Austin suggested that "in view of the drastic changes in the military situation," the Political Committee should take a short recess in order for the representatives of various countries to consult with each other and consult with their governments on the next steps.

    British representative Jebb, in order to divert attention from Malik's exposure of American atrocities, insisted that some atrocities in war were "inevitable." Jebb proposed a recess of forty-eight hours.

    Soviet representative Malik opposed the recess, and pointed out: The Political Committee can proceed with other proposals, such as the Soviet proposal that has already been included in the items for discussion, or discuss other items.

    After a brief discussion, the Political Committee passed Jebb's proposal with forty-six votes to five (seven abstentions), and adjourned for forty-eight hours.

    Malik reminded Chairman U Than that the Soviet representative's proposal regarding the screening of the film of American atrocities had not yet been put to a vote. U Than said: He had to obey the "majority." Thus, without submitting Malik's proposal to a vote, he announced the adjournment.

　　联大政委会讨论所谓《朝鲜停战三人委员会》报告
    苏代表马立克重申支持我国立场
    坚主立即自朝鲜撤退所有外国军队
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社纽约四日讯：联合国大会政治委员会一月三日举行会议，议程上共有三项议案，即：所谓“三人委员会”关于朝鲜战事问题的报告，苏联控诉美国侵略中国案及所谓“福摩萨问题”。
    印度代表劳氏提出他自己所称关于“朝鲜停战三人委员会”之活动的“纯属事实经过的报告”。
    劳氏解释“三人委员会”所拟定的关于“停战”条件的建议，其中一项建议主张建立一条横跨朝鲜，纵深约二十哩的非军事化地带，以三八线为其南面界限。劳氏最后说：“三人委员会”现无法提出任何建议。劳氏报告中引述了中华人民共和国中央人民政府关于“三人委员会”去电报的答复，“三人委员会”的电报曾请求中国政府训令伍修权与“三人委员会”进行谈判。答复指出，联合国大会通过的所谓“朝鲜停战三人委员会”的决议，中华人民共和国的代表并未参加，亦未同意。我国政府曾经多次声明，凡是没有中华人民共和国的合法代表参加和同意而被通过的联合国的一切重大决议，首先是有关亚洲的重大决议，中华人民共和国中央人民政府都认为是非法的，无效的。中华人民共和国中央人民政府因此不能命令其代表伍修权将军继续留在成功湖与上述的非法的“三人委员会”举行谈判。伍修权将军于安全理事会无理地否决了中华人民共和国控诉美国武装侵略台湾案之后，曾复奉中华人民共和国中央人民政府的命令，继续留在成功湖，准备参加讨论苏联代表所提的“控诉美国侵略中国案”。虽然他等待了很长久的时间，联合国大会已经宣告休会，而他仍没有被给以说话的机会。在这种情形之下，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为伍修权将军及其属员等已无留在成功湖的必要，故已命令伍修权将军等于本月十九日启程返国。关于联合国如何与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国取得接触的问题，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，联合国应该直接向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出询问。
    劳氏并谈到中华人民共和国政府十二月二十二日关于“三人委员会”问题的声明。
    继起发言的是苏联代表马立克，他追述苏联曾经反对成立“三人委员会”，并称：现在已经很明显，英美集团设法停战乃是企图强使大会接受那些将使它们能够继续武装侵略朝鲜的措施。各种官方声明和新闻报道都说明，美国并不是要求得和平解决，而是竭力推行其在朝鲜的没有希望的冒险。美国最近的情势发展，例如，宣布全国紧急状态、经济动员、加紧战争歇斯底里、加速重整军备、以及杜鲁门和艾奇逊的侵略性的演说等等都证实了这一点。
    马立克继而援引了许多关于美国敌视中华人民共和国的证据，其中包括轰炸中国领土、强占台湾及阻挠中国参加联合国等等。
    马立克继称，周恩来在十二月二十二日发表的关于建立“三人委员会”的声明（报告员没有宣读这个声明）中明确地说明了和平解决的基本条件。马立克指出，苏联代表团为支持中华人民共和国的立场，曾提出提案。主张立即自朝鲜撤退所有的外国军队，让朝鲜人民自己决定他们的将来。马立克力主迅即通过苏联的提案，他说，唯有采取这样的步骤，联合国大会才能打开建设性的解决之门。
    接着，马立克把自上次会议以来所收到的有关美军与南朝鲜军队所犯暴行的新证据告诉政委会。马立克提到朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线十二月二十六日所发表的第三次报告。马立克详细叙述了残酷地屠杀朝鲜居民与破坏朝鲜的公共建筑等种种暴行后说，美国与李承晚军队的残忍行为已经激起了全世界的公愤。最后，马立克说苏联代表团带有摄下美国在朝鲜的野蛮行为的简短的记录影片，并正式建议政治委员会看一看这个片子。
    秘鲁代表碧朗第要求宣读周恩来在十二月二十二日发表的声明——这个声明已经作为“三人委员会”报告的附件予以发表，因为马立克曾经指出政治委员会对于这个声明置之不理。政治委员会的主席同意秘鲁代表的意见，接着就宣读了周恩来的声明。
    美国代表奥斯汀猛烈攻击中华人民共和国，继续毫无根据地攻击它在朝鲜进行“侵略”。奥斯汀建议“鉴于军事形势有了急剧的变化”，政委会应暂作短时的休会，以便各国代表互相磋商并向其政府请示下一步骤。
    英国代表杰伯为了转移大家对于马立克揭露美国暴行的注意，竟硬说在战争中有些暴行是“不可避免”的。杰伯提议暂时休会四十八小时。
    苏联代表马立克反对休会，并指出：政委会可以着手进行其他的提议，例如已经列入讨论项目中的苏联提案，或者讨论其他议案。
    经过简短讨论后，政委会以四十六票对五票（七票弃权）通过杰伯的提议，休会四十八小时。
    马立克提醒主席乌但尼塔说：苏联代表关于放映美国暴行影片的提议尚未付诸表决。乌但尼塔说：他要服从“多数”。于是未将马立克的提议交付表决，他就宣布休会。
