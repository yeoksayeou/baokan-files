　　U.S. Imperialism's New Plot to Manipulate the UN to Slander New China
	Runs into Difficulties
	Few Coerced Nations Express Support
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] After the failure of the U.S. imperialists' "truce" scheme in Korea, they are once again plotting to manipulate the United Nations to slander China, but are encountering numerous difficulties.

    U.S. Representative Austin twice requested the UN General Assembly Political Committee on January 3rd and 5th to pass a resolution falsely accusing the People's Republic of China of being an "aggressor." Prior to this, a U.S. government spokesman also publicly stated on January 1st that the United States would demand that the United Nations implement "economic and diplomatic sanctions" against China. However, the American news agency Associated Press at the time sadly admitted that these attempts by U.S. imperialism "encountered reefs" in the United Nations, and "many member states" "expressed indifference."

    Faced with this situation, the U.S. government hastily, through its foreign envoys, specially notified the governments of 30 countries, including Britain and France, attempting to coerce them into supporting the U.S. plot. According to the United States Information Service, the United States, in its notification, demanded that various countries agree to "declare" China an "aggressor" and demanded the implementation of "economic blockade, sanctions, embargo, severance of diplomatic relations and other collective measures" against China. At the same time, the U.S. representatives continuously convened negotiations at Lake Success with representatives of various countries of the U.S.-British bloc to exert pressure.

    However, these steps by the U.S. government have failed to make the coerced countries submit obediently. According to the Associated Press, "Apart from the Latin American countries," the replies from various countries "rarely expressed firm support for the U.S. position," and the representatives of various countries "are still hesitant."

　　企图操纵联合国污蔑新中国
    美帝新阴谋遭遇困难   
    被胁迫的国家很少表示支持
    【新华社十五日讯】美帝国主义在朝鲜“停战”诡计破产以后，再度阴谋操纵联合国污蔑中国，但遭到重重困难。
    美国代表奥斯汀曾于一月三日及五日两次在联合国大会政治委员会上要求联合国通过决议，诬指中华人民共和国为“侵略者”。在此以前，美国政府发言人亦曾于一月一日公开声称，美国将要求联合国对中国实行“经济制裁和外交制裁”。但是，美国通讯社美联社当时即悲哀地承认，美帝国主义的这些企图在联合国中“遇到暗礁”，“很多会员国”“表示冷淡”。
    面对着这种境况，美国政府又慌张地经由其驻外使节特别通知英、法等三十国政府，企图胁迫它们支持美国的阴谋。据美国新闻处透露，美国在通知中要求各国赞同“宣布”中国为“侵略者”，并要求对中国实行“经济封锁、制裁、禁运、断绝外交关系及其他集体措施”。与此同时，美国代表并在成功湖连续召集美英集团各国代表举行谈判，加施压力。
    然而，美国政府的这些步骤，并未能使被胁迫的国家俯首贴耳。据美联社透露：“除了拉丁美洲各国以外”，各国的答复“很少表示了对美国立场的坚决支持”，各国代表“均尚犹豫不定”。
