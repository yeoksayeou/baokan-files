　　Vigorously Organize Material Exchange to Stabilize Prices
    ——An Overview of Price and Finance in December 1950
    Yang Fangxun
    In December 1950, on the basis of the stability in November, prices tended to be more stable due to the vigorous organization of material exchange. According to the price index of 31 major commodities in six major cities compiled by the Ministry of Trade, the increase was 5.9 percent in October, a slight increase of 0.5 percent in November, and a slight increase of 0.2 percent in December.

    In December, grain prices remained flat, cotton cloth fell by 0.6 percent, and fuel rose by 5.8 percent. In addition to supplying the market with a large amount of materials to stabilize prices, state-owned trading companies also organized the purchase of cotton and grain, changing the downward trend of cotton and grain prices. What is particularly important is the vigorous organization of material exchange, which has stabilized prices. At present, the main forms of organizing material exchange are as follows:

    (1) State-owned trading companies carry out chain operations. For example, the business of grain, native products, cotton cloth, and department store companies in Jiangxi Province are closely coordinated. On the one hand, they go to the countryside to purchase grain, and at the same time bring daily necessities to the rural areas for promotion. During chain operations, contracts are signed from top to bottom to ensure and support each other. In August and September, a total of 93.95 million catties of grain were purchased, and more than 6,250 pieces of cotton yarn, 68,840 bolts of cloth, and department stores with a total value of more than 12.4 billion yuan were sold.

    (2) State-owned trade institutions sign purchase and exchange contracts with cooperatives and farmers to exchange industrial products for agricultural and sideline products. The purchase contracts implemented in North China are for a period of one to three months. Under the principle of mutual benefit between public and private, state-owned trading companies first purchase cotton and grain from farmers on credit. When the contract expires, farmers are paid with various necessities or cash. The price of the original goods sold by farmers is subject to rise but not fall. Exchange contracts are where farmers exchange grain and cotton for industrial products from trading companies on the spot. These methods are welcomed and accepted by farmers. At the same time, it can also appropriately solve the difficulties of state-owned companies in terms of organization, manpower, and funds.

    (3) Organize private merchants to go to the countryside to purchase goods. Some areas organize joint public-private purchase and operation to reduce blind rush purchases. In order to encourage private merchants to go to the countryside for procurement, the people's government should help them solve various difficulties. The industrial and commercial departments of Nanchang City generally write letters of introduction to the rural task force, so as to obtain the assistance of district and township governments. State banks provide loans to joint venture teams with insufficient funds. State-owned trading companies adopt methods such as entrusted purchases and sales to organize private merchants to operate in the countryside. However, in the organization of joint purchases and operations, some private merchants have the wrong idea of "using public funds to support private interests" and relying on the state-owned economy, which should be corrected. For example, the 24 joint venture teams in Nanchang City have a total capital of 2 billion yuan, of which only 26 percent is raised by private merchants themselves, and the remaining 74 percent are loans from the National Bank. This phenomenon is unreasonable and should be corrected urgently.

    The financial situation in December was: deposits increased, loans decreased; gold and silver prices fell, and securities rose. According to statistics from seven major cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Beijing, the deposit balance of the National Bank at the end of December increased by 1.2 percent compared with the end of November; the deposits of private banks increased by 15 percent at the end of December compared with the end of November. The increase in deposits of the National Bank was mainly due to the strengthening of cash management and the efforts to develop savings business; the increase in deposits of private banks indicated a reduction in commercial speculation, and a portion of floating capital has flowed into banks. The reason for the slight decrease in loans is the result of appropriately tightening currency. According to statistics from seven major cities, the loan balance of the National Bank at the end of December decreased by 16 percent compared with the end of November, and the loan balance of private banks decreased by 7.9 percent at the end of December compared with the end of November. It should be pointed out that in order to support the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the amount of loans from the National Bank across the country still increased compared with November.

    The fall in gold and silver prices and the rise in securities prices indicate a reduction in speculation and the transfer of floating capital to the securities market.

　　大力组织物资交流平稳物价
    ——一九五○年十二月份物价金融概述
    杨方勋
    一九五○年十二月份的物价，在十一月份稳定的基础上，加上大力组织物资交流，更加趋于平稳。据贸易部编制的六大城市三十一种主要商品的物价指数，十月份是上升百分之五·九，十一月份是微升百分之○·五，十二月份是微升百分之○·二。
    在十二月份中，粮食价格持平，花纱布下落百分之○·六，燃料则上升了百分之五·八。国营贸易公司除以大量物资供应市场平稳物价外，并组织收购棉、粮，改变了棉、粮落价的趋势。特别重要的，是大力组织物资交流，使物价得以稳定。目前，组织物资交流的主要形式，有如下三种：
    （一）国营贸易公司开展连环业务。如江西省粮食、土产、花纱布、百货等公司的业务密切配合，一方面下乡收购粮食，同时即把日用必需品带到农村推销。进行连环业务时，自上而下地签订合同，相互保证，相互支持。八、九两月共收购粮食九千三百九十五万斤，推销棉纱六千二百五十余件，布六万八千八百四十匹，百货总值一百二十四亿余元。
    （二）国营贸易机构，通过合作社和农民订立赊购、换购合同，使工业品和农副业产品进行交换。华北地区实行的赊购合同，为期一至三月不等，在公私两利原则下，先由国营贸易公司向农民赊购棉花、粮食，合同期满时，以各种必需品或现金偿付农民，农民所售原货作价，听涨不听落。换购合同是农民拿粮食、棉花，和贸易公司的工业品当场换购。这种办法，都是农民所欢迎与接受的。同时，还可以适当地解决国营公司的机构、人力、资金等方面的困难。
    （三）组织私商下乡收购。有的地区组织公私商联营联购，减少盲目抢购现象。为了鼓励私商下乡采购，人民政府应帮助他们解决各种困难。南昌市工商部门普遍给下乡小组写介绍信，以便取得区乡政府的协助。对资金不足的联营小组，国家银行则给予贷款。国营贸易公司采取委托代购、代销等方式，组织私商下乡经营。但在组织联购联营中，有些私商却存在着“以公养私”依赖国营经济的错误思想，是应当纠正的。如南昌市二十四个联营小组，共计资金二十亿，其中仅百分之二十六是私商自筹的，其余百分之七十四都是国家银行的贷款，这种现象是不合理的，亟应改正的。

    十二月份的金融方面是：存款增加，放款减少；金银落价，证券上升。根据上海、天津、武汉、重庆、广州、西安、北京七大城市的统计，国家银行存款余额十二月底比十一月底增加百分之一点二；私营行庄存款十二月底比十一月底增加百分之十五。国家银行存款的增加，主要是加强了现金管理，和努力开展了储蓄业务；私营行庄存款的增加，说明了商业投机的减少，一部分游资已流入行庄。放款所以略有减少，则是适当紧缩通货的结果。据七大城市统计，国家银行放款余额十二月底较十一月底减少百分之十六，私营行庄放款余额十二月底较十一月底减少百分之七点九。应当指出的，是国家银行为了扶助城乡物资交流，全国的放款金额，还是比十一月份增加的。
    金银落价，证券上升，说明了投机减少，游资转向了证券市场。
