Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: Soviet commentator Malinin commented in *Pravda*'s international review on the special note issued by the U.S. State Department to the governments of thirty United Nations member states, which demanded that the People's Republic of China be declared an aggressor and that sanctions be imposed against it.

Malinin wrote: On January 5, U.S. representative Austin made a similar so-called "proposal" in a speech to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. Now, Acheson, bypassing the United Nations, directly issued a note filled with threats and intimidation to the governments of thirty countries, forcing them to support the U.S. "proposal." The American directive includes an open threat to the United Nations. In Acheson's recent words, if the United Nations proves unable to solve the problems it faces, if it does not obey American demands on the China issue, then its prestige and power will decline. Acheson's threat does not prove the strength of his position, but rather the weakness of his position. Obviously, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the American ruling class to act as the "head" in the United Nations. They have crowned themselves with this role by means of the notorious "voting machine" which in no way reflects the balance of power on the international stage.

The pressure exerted by the United States on thirty United Nations member states is not limited to the brazen proposal to declare the People's Republic of China an "aggressor." The United States also demands the severance of diplomatic relations with China, while resolutely advocating "economic and military sanctions" against China. All of this undoubtedly proves that the American ruling clique is developing its war hysteria and is attempting to ignite the flames of world war.

The policy of the American ruling clique is a policy of madness and adventurism. It is characterized by extreme shortsightedness and stubborn refusal to assess the facts. Facts are beginning to prove that the calculations of the American rulers have caused them major errors. When the American ruling clique launched aggression in Asia, they thought they could intimidate the Chinese and Korean people and make them submit, thereby creating the necessary conditions for turning the whole of Asia into a colony of the New American Empire. What was their answer? The Chinese and Korean people united as never before, and not only all of Asia, but also peace-loving people all over the world gave them fraternal support. Therefore, the result is: America's reputation has declined miserably, and its policies have universally encountered obvious crises.

Truman would rather ignore these mistakes and continue to strengthen the policies that caused these mistakes. Experience has proven that, in politics, increasing failures are bound to create crises, and the continuous deterioration and expansion of crises will inevitably lead to disaster.

    评美国致三十国通知
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：苏评论家马里宁在真理报国际述评中评论美国国务院向三十个联合国会员国政府所发出的特别通知，该通知要求宣布中华人民共和国为侵略者，并要求对其施行制裁。
    马里宁写道：一月五日，美国代表奥斯汀曾在联大政委会演说中提出类似的所谓“建议”，现在，艾奇逊又撇开联合国，直接向三十个国家的政府发出充满了威胁与恫吓的通知，强迫他们支持美国的“建议”。美国的训令中包括对联合国的公然威胁，用艾奇逊最近的说法，如果联合国证明不能解决它面临的问题，如果它不服从美国在中国问题上的要求，那末，它的威望与权力就会衰落。艾奇逊的威胁并非证明他所处的地位有力，而是证明他所处的地位软弱。显然，美国统治阶级已越来越难于在联合国中充当“头目”了，他们是借助于臭名昭著的一点也不能反映国际舞台上的力量对比的“表决机器”而自封为这个角色的。
    美国对三十个联合国会员国施用的压力，并不限于宣布中华人民共和国为“侵略者”这个厚颜无耻的建议。美国还要求与中国断绝外交关系，同时坚决主张对中国施行“经济及军事制裁”。所有这一切都毫无疑问地证明了：美国统治集团正在大发其战争歇斯底里，而且正企图煽起世界战争的大火。
    美国统治集团的政策是疯狂与冒险主义的政策。它的特征乃是极端近视与固执地不肯估计事实。事实开始证明：美国统治者们的盘算已给他们造成重大的错误。美国统治集团在亚洲发动侵略时，本以为他们能够威吓中国人民与朝鲜人民，使他们屈服，从而创造把整个亚洲变成新美利坚帝国的殖民地的必要条件的。他们得到的答复是什么呢？中国人民与朝鲜人民空前地团结起来了，不仅全亚洲、而且全世界爱好和平的人民却给他们以兄弟般的支援。因此，结果是：美国的声望悲惨地下降，它的政策普遍地遭遇到明显的危机。
    杜鲁门宁可忽视这些错误，而继续加强正是造成这些错误的方针。经验证明：在政治方面，日益增大的失败势必造成危机，而危机的不断恶化与扩大，是一定会招致灾难的。
