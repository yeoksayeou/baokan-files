On Issues Regarding the Catholic Reform Movement
    Guangyuan Catholic Church in Northern Sichuan Answers Inquiries from Church Members
    [Our Newspaper] Since the Guangyuan County Catholic Church in Sichuan issued a reform declaration on November 30, 1950, various places across the country have responded enthusiastically. During this period, the Guangyuan Catholic Church received numerous letters from church members, praising the church's momentous action and inquiring about the reform situation. To further develop the Catholic Reform Movement, the Guangyuan Catholic Church has publicly published the letters and brief answers.
    (1) Letter from Father Liu Yongyuan of Tianshui County, Gansu: I love the Church, but I also love the motherland. Several months ago, I wanted to initiate this matter in Tianshui, but I was unable to do so due to the suppression by foreigners (referring to Germans, Italians, etc.) and the low level of awareness among church members. We do not know what the objective environment in Guangyuan is like, and what the Bishop's reaction to you is?
    Answer: Our Bishop is a foreigner and has not yet reacted. The initiation and promotion of this work are mainly undertaken by church members acting as the backbone. This sacred task of ours is not allowed to be obstructed by anyone, and we cannot compromise with anyone.
    (2) Letter from Father Liu Jianxun of Anyang: After seeing your declaration, I very much agree with it. Please tell us about the initiation of the reform movement and the progress of the movement, so that we can follow your example.
    Answer: Since the liberation of Guangyuan at the end of 1949, we have deeply felt the corruption within the Church. We have studied the reasons for the corruption, which are caused by the bad practices and toxic money of imperialist elements in the Church. Therefore, to eradicate these corrupt phenomena, we must implement self-reliance; to achieve self-reliance, we must reform. In recent months, imperialist aggression against our country has become increasingly obvious. To defend the peace that our church members have sought for many years, to consolidate the democratic camp, and to remove the last foothold of imperialist aggression, self-reliance has become even more urgent. When Fu Jen Catholic University in Beijing was reorganized, Sun Keqiang, a church member among us, wrote to Chen Yuan, the president of Fu Jen Catholic University, hoping that he would come forward to lead the Chinese Catholic Church to break away from the influence of imperialism. It was not until the vigorous development of the Christian Reform Movement that the awareness of church members generally improved. Under these conditions, we raised the banner of self-reliance and reform, and formally announced that the Chinese Church belongs to Chinese church members. Our work is divided into three aspects: 1. Autonomy: Taking the parish as a unit, establish a parish affairs committee, where church members and priests cooperate to undertake organization, evangelization, and financial work. 2. Self-sufficiency: Full-time personnel engage in labor production, plus the contributions of church members, as a source of income. 3. Self-propagation: Promote political study, and temporarily maintain the original state of worship and scriptures. Our aim is to return the Church to its original position in religion and to resolutely stand on the side of the people in politics. As for further principles, they need to be discussed and determined jointly after more than half of the dioceses across the country have universally and deeply responded.
    (3) Letter from Cai Deju, a monk in Beijing: From the practices of general foreign missionaries that I have seen over the years, I am extremely saddened. They use the Church to satisfy their own enjoyment, completely losing the spirit of Christ and Paul. Now they are slandering their own misfortune as religious persecution. Seeing these things, I angrily stopped studying at the major seminary. Today, seeing your declaration, I feel like I have seen the light of day again. We must not only get rid of the shackles of imperialism, but also thoroughly cleanse its legacy. This is a great work, and we must have an orderly pace. I am willing to launch a signature campaign in Beijing.
    Answer: We warmly welcome the churches in the areas where the Bishops of Beijing are located to actively lead this movement. And we hope that progressive church members in various places will challenge each other.
    (4) Comrade Lu Guoheng from Xi'an, a member of the People's Liberation Army and also a church member, wrote: I firmly support your declaration and thank the motherland for calling on us to strive for the independence and sanctity of the Church and the construction of a new China. We must dedicate our strength to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect our Homes and Defend our Country.
    Answer: We hope that church members across the country can follow your example. Since we have joined the peace camp, we should contribute to peace.

　　关于天主教革新运动诸问题
    川北广元天主堂答复教友询问
    【本报讯】一九五○年十一月三十日四川广元县天主堂发表革新宣言后，全国各地已纷纷响应。在这期间，广元天主堂收到不少教友投来的函件，除盛赞该堂这一壮举外，并询问有关革新情况。广元天主堂为使天主教革新运动获得进一步开展，特将来函及简答公开发表。
    （一）甘肃天水县刘永源神父来函：我爱教会，但也热爱祖国，数月以前，我便想在天水发动这件事，无如外籍人（指德国人、意大利人等）多方压制，以及教友觉悟程度不高，而未能见诸行动。我们不知道广元的客观环境如何，主教对于你们的反应如何？
    答：我们的主教是外国人，尚无反应。发起并推动这一工作主要是由教友起骨干作用。我们这一神圣任务，是不容许任何人来阻挠，我们不能向任何人妥协。
    （二）安阳刘建勋神父来函：看到你们的宣言后，我非常赞同。请你们将发起革新运动及运动进展的情况告诉我们，以便效法。
    答：自一九四九年底广元解放以来，我们便深深感到教会内部的腐化。我们研究腐化的原因，乃是由于教会中的帝国主义分子们的不良作风与有毒的金钱所造成的。因此，要铲除这些腐化现象，就必须实行自立；要自立就必须革新。最近数月来，帝国主义对我国的侵略愈来愈明显，为了保卫我们教友常年所企求的和平，为了巩固民主阵营，为了撤除帝国主义侵略的最后踏脚石，自立便更显得迫切了。当北京辅仁大学改组时，我们当中的孙克强教友曾写信给辅仁大学陈垣校长，盼望他能出来领导中国天主教脱离帝国主义的影响。直到基督教的革新运动蓬勃开展后，教友们的觉悟普遍提高了。在这种条件下，我们竖起了自立革新的旗帜，正式宣布中国教会属于中国教友。我们的工作分为三个方面；一、自治：以堂为单位，成立堂务会，由教友与神父合作，担任组织、宣教及财经等工作。二、自养：有专职人员从事劳动生产，加上教友们的奉献，做为经济来源。三、自传：提倡政治学习，对于原有的崇拜与经课暂维原状。我们的宗旨是要使教会在宗教上回到教会的本位，在政治上坚决站在人民的立场。至于进一步的原则，是需要全国有过半的教区普遍深入地响应后共同来商定的。
    （三）北京蔡德居修士来函：从多年来我所看到的一般外国传教士的作风，使我极为痛心，他们利用教会来满足自己的享受，完全失去了基督和保罗的精神。现在他们又把自己的厄运诬为教难。看到这些，我气愤地停止了在大修院的攻读。今天看到你们的宣言，使我重见天日，我们不但要摆脱帝国主义的羁绊，更要彻底洗清其遗毒。这是一件伟大的工作，必须有整齐的步伐才行。我愿在北京展开签名运动。
    答：我们热烈欢迎北京各主教所在地的教会积极起来领导这一运动。并盼望各地前进教友彼此挑战。
    （四）西安吕国衡同志，是人民解放军的一员，也是教友，他来信说，我坚决拥护你们的宣言，并感谢祖国号召我们为教会的独立圣洁和新中国的建设而努力。我们要为抗美援朝保家卫国献出力量。
    答：我们希望全国的教友都能向你看齐，我们加入了和平阵营，就应当为和平立功。
