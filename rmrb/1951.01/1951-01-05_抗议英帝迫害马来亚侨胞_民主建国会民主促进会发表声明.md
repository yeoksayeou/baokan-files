　　Protesting British Imperialist Persecution of Overseas Chinese in Malaya
    Democratic National Construction Association and China Association for Promoting Democracy Issue Statements
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd] A spokesman for the Democratic National Construction Association issued a statement protesting the British imperialist persecution of overseas Chinese in Malaya. The statement stated: In order to maintain their decadent rule over their Far East colonies, British imperialists, while carrying out the slaughter of the Malayan people, are also conducting a frenzied persecution of our 2.8 million overseas Chinese residing in Malaya. The number of our overseas Chinese who have been expelled, murdered, imprisoned, and whose property has been burned and looted is countless. This act of hostility towards the Chinese people by British imperialism is intolerable to all members of our Democratic National Construction Association and the people of the entire country. We firmly support the protest statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government. British imperialism should immediately release all imprisoned overseas Chinese, stop the persecution and expulsion of overseas Chinese, compensate our overseas Chinese for the losses suffered due to illegal persecution, and ensure the safety of their lives and property and all other legitimate rights and interests.
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 4th] The China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a statement on January 3rd protesting the British imperialist persecution of our overseas Chinese in Malaya. The statement said: Our overseas Chinese in Malaya have engaged in productive construction through hard work for a long time and made many contributions. Their heroic deeds in the War of Resistance Against Japan were even publicly acknowledged by the British colonial authorities. However, in order to consolidate its criminal rule over the colony, the British colonial authorities in Malaya have used various malicious methods to persecute our overseas Chinese, expelling, mistreating, imprisoning, murdering, poisoning, burning, and looting, exhausting the most cruel and barbaric means, causing serious losses to the lives and property of our 2.8 million overseas Chinese in Malaya. In addition to expressing our deep condolences to the victimized overseas Chinese, we lodge a serious protest against this shameless act of British imperialism, which is hostile to overseas Chinese and hostile to the Chinese people. We firmly support the just statement issued by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government on December 29th, and call on all members of this association and the people of the whole country to rise up and support overseas Chinese in Malaya with practical actions, and fight against the bloody persecution of British imperialism.
    [Xinhua News Agency] TASS, Prague, January 3rd: The correspondent of the Electric Communication Agency reported from Singapore: The British authorities have taken new oppressive measures against Chinese citizens living in Singapore. They dissolved the Ai Hua Society, a music and drama association founded sixteen years ago to spread Chinese culture. Police searched the society's clubhouse, arrested the society's secretary, and confiscated 5,000 copies of the society's publication, "Ai Hua Weekly."
