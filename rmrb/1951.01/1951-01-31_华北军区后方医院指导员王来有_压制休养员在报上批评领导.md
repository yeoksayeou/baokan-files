Party Life

　　The North China Liberation Army Daily on January 13th exposed the incident of Wang Laiyou, the political instructor of the third company of the first branch of the second rear hospital of the North China Military Region, suppressing convalescents from criticizing leaders in the Party newspaper. On November 27th and December 10th of last year, comrades Zhang Mengliang, Lin Xiaoquan, and three other convalescents from the company sent letters to the North China Liberation Army Daily, exposing and criticizing the serious bureaucracy in the work style of the third company's leadership and demanding that the responsible comrades of the third company conduct a public self-criticism. At the time, in order to handle the matter cautiously, the North China Liberation Army Daily forwarded Zhang and Lin's letters to the Logistics and Health Department of the North China Military Region for investigation and handling. On December 11th, Zhang, Lin, and the other comrades wrote again, saying, "After Comrade Wang, the instructor of the company, discovered that we had written to the newspaper, he not only did not examine his own mistakes, but also told the five of us to prepare to receive 'education' at the soldiers' meeting, on the grounds that we did not understand the facts and privately sent articles to the newspaper. In addition to being forced to write 'repentance letters,' we will also be punished and our articles will be declared invalid..." In this way, Wang Laiyou directly violated the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" and the instructions of the Political Department of the North China Military Region on implementing this decision. On December 12th, the North China Liberation Army Daily immediately forwarded the original documents to the Military Region Health Department for investigation and handling. The leadership of the Health Department attached great importance to this issue. On December 9th, a working group was sent to the hospital to conduct an investigation and handling, returning to the department on December 18th after completing the task. According to the working group's investigation, it was indeed a fact that instructor Wang Laiyou suppressed criticism. The circumstances were as follows:

　　When Comrade Wang Laiyou learned that Comrades Zhang, Lin, and others had sent letters to the newspaper exposing his bureaucracy, he not only did not conduct a sincere self-criticism, but also used the excuse that the criticism was not entirely factual; that the hospital's work had improved compared to the past; and that the letter had not been reviewed by him, to criticize Comrades Zhang, Lin, and others for directly writing to the newspaper to criticize the leadership as an act of being unorganized and undisciplined. He forced Zhang, Lin, and others to write repentance letters, first writing them once and then being asked to write them a second time. He also prepared to convene a soldiers' meeting to conduct struggle sessions and retaliate against the critics. After the working group of the Health Department and Director Yu of the General Hospital pointed out his mistakes at a cadre meeting, Comrade Wang Laiyou still did not examine himself and persisted in his mistakes. He said, "They (referring to the critics) have already admitted their mistakes and written repentance letters. Zhang and Lin are the main writers, and the others are accessories. Our work has shortcomings, but it is much better than before! They should be dealt with..." In order to help Comrade Wang Laiyou recognize his mistakes, the branch hospital conducted a study of the Central Committee's decision and the North China Military Region's instructions at an expanded meeting of the Party committee. With everyone's help, Comrade Wang Laiyou initially admitted that he had made a mistake. On the 13th, at a meeting of cadres at the platoon level and above, Comrade Cao Siwen, the section chief in charge of the working group, reported the materials he had investigated to everyone and pointed out that Comrade Wang Laiyou's suppression of criticism was wrong and violated principles. On the 15th, before the general meeting of all staff and convalescents, Director Li of the Political Department of the hospital individually talked with Comrade Wang Laiyou to help him reflect on his actions. However, at the meeting, Comrade Wang Laiyou was still argumentative and did not sincerely examine himself. He even directly asked everyone, "Are you saying that everyone can write articles to criticize as they please from now on?" Although he admitted the next day after the meeting that this sentence was wrong, in his final written self-criticism, he only examined the shortcomings in his work (which was very necessary), and did not mention a single word about violating the principles of the Central Committee and the North China Military Region on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications. This shows that he still has not deeply recognized this mistake.

　　In order to implement the decisions of the Central Committee and the North China Military Region and correctly launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Military Region's Party believes that Wang Laiyou's principled mistake of suppressing criticism, which violates Party discipline, should be subject to disciplinary sanctions. Therefore, this fact is announced in the Party newspaper, and the Logistics and Health Department's Party Discipline Inspection Committee is instructed to discuss the handling of this issue and help Comrade Wang Laiyou thoroughly recognize and correct his mistakes.

### 华北军区后方医院指导员王来有  压制休养员在报上批评领导

　　华北军区后方医院指导员王来有
    压制休养员在报上批评领导
    一月十三日的华北解放军报揭露了华北军区第二后方医院一分院第三连政治指导员王来有压制休养员在党报上批评领导的事件。去年十一月二十七日和十二月十日该连休养员张孟良、林小权等五同志曾投函华北解放军报，揭露和批评三连领导作风上的严重的官僚主义，并要求三连负责同志进行公开检讨。当时华北解放军报为了慎重处理起见，即将张、林的信件转到华北军区后勤卫生部调查处理。十二月十一日张、林等同志又去信说：“连里王指导员发觉我们向报社写信后，他不但不检讨自己的错误，并叫我们五人准备在军人大会上受“教育”，原因是说我们不了解事实，私自向报社寄稿，除强迫写“悔过书”外，还要受处分和声明稿件作废……”这样王来有直接违背了《中共中央委员会关于在报纸刊物上开展批评和自我批评的决定》及华北军区政治部关于执行此决定的指示。十二日华北解放军报即将原件转军区卫生部调查处理。卫生部领导上对这一问题是很重视的，十二月九日即曾派工作组赴该院进行调查处理，于十二月十八日事毕返部。据工作组调查指导员王来有压制批评确是事实，经过情形如下：
    当王来有同志知道张、林等同志向报社投函揭露自己的官僚主义后，不但不进行虚心的自我检讨，并借口批评不完全是事实；医院工作比过去有进步和该信未经过自己审查等原因，即批评张、林等同志直接投书报社批评领导是一种无组织无纪律的行为，并迫令张、林等写悔过书，第一次不行又叫写第二次，并准备召开军人大会进行斗争，对批评者加以报复。经卫生部工作组和总院于院长在干部会上指出其错误后，王来有同志仍不检讨，坚持错误，他说：“他们（指批评者）已经承认错误，并且写了悔过书。张、林二人是主笔，其他是胁从者。我们的工作有缺点，但比以前好的多啦！应该处理他们……”为了帮助王来有同志认识自己的错误，十二日分院在党委扩大会上将中央的决定与华北军区的指示两个文件进行了研究，在大家的帮助下，王来有同志才初步承认了是个错误。十三日在排以上干部会上，工作组负责同志曹思文科长把所调查的材料向大家报告之后，指出了王来有同志压制批评是不应该的，是违犯原则的。十五日在全体工作人员和休养人员大会前，院部政治处李主任并和王来有同志进行了个别谈话，帮助他进行反省。可是到了会上王来有同志仍是强辞夺理不虚心检讨，还直问大家：“你们说这以后大家就可以随便写稿批评了吧？”大会的第二天虽然他承认了这句话是不对的，但在最后自己的书面检讨里只把工作中的缺点进行了检讨（这是很必要的），对违犯中央和华北军区关于在报纸刊物上开展批评与自我批评的原则错误还是一字不提。这说明他对这一错误还没深刻认识。
    为了执行中央及华北军区的决定，正确的在报刊上开展批评与自我批评，华北军区党的纪律检查委员会认为王来有压制批评这一违犯党纪的原则性错误，是应当受到纪律制裁的；故将这一事实在党报上公布，并责成后勤卫生部党的纪律检查委员会讨论这一问题的处理办法，和帮助王来有同志彻底认识与纠正自己的错误。
