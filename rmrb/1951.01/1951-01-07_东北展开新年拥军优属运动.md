　　Northeast Launches New Year's Campaign to Support the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Military Families

　　[This newspaper's dispatch] The people of Northeast China are enthusiastically launching a New Year's campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to military families. Shenyang City held its first meeting of representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary military personnel families before the New Year. The Municipal People's Government, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and various people's organizations jointly hosted a banquet for all the representatives. Districts also distributed rice and meat to poor martyrs' families and military families for the New Year. In Dalian City, support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-military-families committees have been generally established in various districts and neighborhoods. Citizens are voluntarily extending New Year greetings to the families of martyrs and military personnel and helping them celebrate the New Year. The masses in Shahekou District voluntarily sent sixty-four sets of cotton-padded clothes and twelve cotton quilts to the poorer families of martyrs and military personnel. On New Year's Day, mass organizations in various places formed Yangko dance troupes to pay New Year's visits to the families of martyrs and military personnel and present them with "Glorious Family" lanterns. People from all walks of life in Songjiang Province formed three comfort groups, led by Chairman Feng Zhongyun of the Provincial People's Government and others, respectively, and carried a large number of comfort goods to visit honorary soldiers, the wounded and sick, and troops in various cities and counties. The party and government organs and various people's organizations of Rehe Province have jointly formed a New Year's Support-the-Army Comfort Committee. Organs and organizations in Chengde, Chifeng, and other counties such as Wudan also presented a large number of comfort items to honorary soldiers' schools, farms, and recuperating wounded and sick soldiers. The three comfort groups jointly formed by the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Party Committee went to various places to comfort the garrison troops and their families. The families of martyrs and military personnel in Northeast China who received warm greetings from the government and the people were all very happy. Many family members of revolutionary soldiers wrote letters to their children and husbands, wishing them to perform meritorious service for the people in the glorious cause of consolidating national defense and defending the motherland.
