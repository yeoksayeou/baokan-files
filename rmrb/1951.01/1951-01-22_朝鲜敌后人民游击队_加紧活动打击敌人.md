　　Korean People's Guerrilla Units Behind Enemy Lines
    Intensify Activities to Strike the Enemy
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch] Coordinating with the victorious offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Guerrilla units are intensifying their activities, striking the enemy day and night. According to an Associated Press dispatch from the Eighth Army Headquarters of the American aggressor army on the 18th, Korean People's "Guerrillas are infiltrating through the current United Nations line of defense (referring to the American aggressor army's defense line)." The Korean People's Guerrilla units, who originally persisted in heroic combat behind enemy lines, "have become more active." "They have rearmed themselves in the deep mountains. They are attacking from the mountains day and night, with increasing numbers and activity. Some are setting up roadblocks and laying mines on the roads. Others are ambushing convoys heading to the front, blowing up bridges, attacking trains, and seizing villages as operational bases." The Korean People's Guerrilla units are striking the enemy at any time, causing great distress to the American aggressor army, which is under attack from both the front and the rear. The Associated Press reporter said: "For the United Nations forces, it is like being constantly mindful of a hornet's nest, while at the same time being stung in the rear." The Associated Press despairingly said: Guerrilla activity "will continue as long as the United Nations forces remain in Korea." The Eighth Army Headquarters of the U.S. military invading Korea, in order to cover up the blows given to it by the Korean People's Guerrilla units, has specially blocked news in this regard, "forbidding mention of guerrilla activity behind the United Nations lines."

　　朝鲜敌后人民游击队
    加紧活动打击敌人
    【新华社二十日讯】配合着朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的胜利进攻，朝鲜人民游击队正在加紧活动，日夜打击敌人。据美联社驻美国侵略军第八军总部记者十八日电透露：朝鲜人民“游击队正通过目前联合国防线（按指美国侵略军防线）而渗透进来”。原来在敌后坚持英勇战斗的朝鲜人民游击队“已变得更加活跃”。“他们已在深山中重新武装起来了。他们在白昼与夜间从山里出击，人数愈来愈多，并日益活跃。他们有的建立路障和在道路上布雷。其他的人则伏击驰向前线去的运输队，炸毁桥梁，袭击火车并夺取村落作为作战基地”。朝鲜人民游击队随时打击敌人，使腹背受敌的美国侵略军十分苦恼。美联社记者说：“对于联合国部队说，它像时时在留心一个黄蜂窝那样，同时却在后方被刺了一下。”美联社绝望地说：游击队活动“在联合国部队留在朝鲜的一天，都会持续下去的。”侵朝美军第八军总部为了掩盖朝鲜人民游击队所给予它的打击，特别封锁这方面的消息，“不准谈到游击队在联合国阵线后方的活动”。
