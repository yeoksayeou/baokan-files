Huaibei Five Provinces Begin to Organize Inter-Provincial Material Exchange

[Our Newspaper] The North China Five Provinces Cooperative General Association has begun organizing material exchanges between cooperative members in different provinces based on the demands of its members. Under the leadership and assistance of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, a cloth-grain exchange agreement was signed on December 6, 1950. This exchange was carried out through unified dispatching by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. Hebei Province purchased 100,000 bolts of native cloth from its members, and Pingyuan purchased 10,000 bolts, for a total of 110,000 bolts. According to the locations and quantities designated by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, these were transported to the provincial cooperative receiving points in Zhangjiakou, Guihua, Baotou, Taiyuan, and other places. Suiyuan purchased 3,000,000 catties of grain, Chahar purchased 3,500,000 catties of grain, and Shanxi purchased 300,000 catties of millet, for a total of 6,800,000 catties of grain. These were directly transported to the designated receiving points in Hebei and Pingyuan, and then distributed to members through the organizational systems of each province to meet their needs. It was required that all the aforementioned grain and cloth be transported by January 1951. Packaging and transportation expenses were to be borne by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. The purchase price of each commodity was set according to the local price on the day of delivery, with a slightly higher adjustment to ensure that members received tangible benefits. Hebei Province sent three cadres, and Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Chahar provinces each sent one cadre, to be responsible for organizing and inspecting this work under the leadership of the All-China Federation. This agreement was established by the five provincial cooperatives based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. It marks the beginning of a cooperative trade network between provinces, which will play a significant role in organizing material exchanges, solving the sales problems of members' products, protecting members' interests, and stimulating and improving production.

Hebei Yongnian County Cooperative and State-Owned Trading Company Successfully Carry Out Large-Scale Credit Purchase Work

[Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] The large-scale cotton credit purchase work carried out by the Yongnian County Cooperative and the state-owned trading company in Hebei Province has not only met the urgent need of cotton farmers to sell their stored cotton in a timely manner in order to regularly exchange it for living materials and production materials, but also solved the difficulty of the state-owned trading company and the cooperative not being able to immediately recover all the cotton in the area with cash.

Yongnian County is one of the famous cotton-producing areas in Hebei Province, with cotton planting area accounting for more than 31 percent of the county's total cultivated land. This year's cotton harvest was abundant, with a total yield of 34 million catties, most of which needed to be sold. After the new cotton came on the market this autumn, the state-owned trading company and the cooperative immediately purchased 15 million catties with cash. The total amount of this cash reached 37.5 billion yuan, which, based on the county's population of 340,000, averaged 110,000 yuan per person. At this time, the state-owned trading company and the cooperative stopped purchasing cotton with cash in order to avoid price fluctuations caused by the large amount of currency put into circulation in a short period of time. However, cotton farmers still had a large amount of cotton in their hands that urgently needed to be sold. The proposal for the state-owned trading company to carry out credit purchases from cotton farmers through cooperatives, and for cooperatives to carry out credit purchases from their members, was put forward under these circumstances and was warmly welcomed by cotton farmers. By mid-November, the Yongnian County Cooperative and the state-owned trading company had jointly purchased 1.8 million catties of cotton on credit from farmers, accounting for about 10 percent of the cotton still held by farmers.

There are four types of credit purchase methods in the area, which are carried out in conjunction with deposit-based credit and tax collection on behalf of the government. One is temporary credit purchase: members temporarily store cotton with the cooperative, determine a time, and receive currency or goods at the end of the period. If currency is desired, it listens to rises but not falls; if goods are desired, they are exchanged at the current price. The second is regular deposit: all cotton deposited by members is converted into standard cotton, a certain amount of interest is determined, and at the end of the period, goods (grain, cotton cloth, etc.) or currency are paid according to the actual needs of the depositors. The third is deposit for barter: members and the cooperative first agree on the price of cotton and the goods to be exchanged, and settle accounts at the end of the period without interest. The fourth is deposit for tax payment: members store cotton in the cooperative, and the cooperative pays public grain on their behalf without interest. These four methods allow cotton farmers to sell their surplus cotton at a reasonable price on credit, and exchange it for the goods they need or withdraw currency after a certain period. At the same time, it prevents the state-owned trading company and the cooperative from causing price fluctuations due to putting too much currency into circulation in a short period of time by buying cotton entirely with cash.

The main key to carrying out credit purchases is the establishment of a credit relationship between the state-owned trading company and the cooperative. In the spring of last year, the county cooperative once purchased military cloth on behalf of the state-owned trading company. When members had already woven a large amount of cloth, but the grain for purchasing the cloth by the state-owned trading company had not arrived, the county cooperative adopted the method of members first handing over the military cloth and then receiving grain on a regular basis with a voucher. The credit was very good, and some members did not take the grain even after the deadline. The cooperative actively converted the grain exchange vouchers of the depositors into deposit vouchers and paid interest. Therefore, when purchasing cotton on credit this time, the members trusted the cooperative. In this credit purchase, the Douxia Township Cooperative in the county was able to pay members goods or currency on time in accordance with the credit purchase contract. Therefore, its credit is increasing day by day, the number of members willing to purchase on credit is increasing, the amount of cotton purchased on credit is larger, and the time given for credit is longer.

Northeast Cooperative General Association Exchanges Native Products of Various Provinces

[Our Newspaper] In order to massively promote the agricultural and sideline products of cooperative members and supply the needs of cooperative members, the Northeast Cooperative General Association has concentrated its efforts to strengthen procurement and trade work since the fourth quarter of 1950, and plans to purchase 130,000 tons of grain from December to the end of February 1951. According to statistics from Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces, 9,259 tons have already been purchased, and 2,190 tons have been shipped out. For the purchase plan of 40,000 tons of bean cake, in addition to the subsidiary enterprises of cooperative at all levels starting processing, 180 tons have been shipped into the customs. At the same time, in order to solve the sales problem of wheat for farmers in Songjiang, the General Association ordered 30,000 bags of flour from the Songjiang Provincial Cooperative and purchased 700,000 catties of dried tofu. In terms of supplying the needs of cooperative members, 220,000 catties of raw cotton and more than 21,000 bolts of various cloths have been shipped from within the customs in December and distributed to lower-level cooperatives.

At the same time, in order to better complete the winter supply and marketing work, at the business meeting of all Northeast Cooperatives held in early December 1950, material exchanges were carried out between the Northeast Cooperatives, breaking the phenomenon of mutual disconnection between supply and demand in the past. Various brother cooperatives first signed 39 exchange contracts, including 18 kinds of products such as white pork, fish, wheat, rice, apples, and dried sea shrimp, with a total amount of approximately 258.5 billion yuan (Northeast currency, the same below). This is to supply a large number of pigs and grains from North Manchuria to the cities in South Manchuria, and supply the specialties of South Manchuria—apples and peanuts—to North Manchuria. This shows that material exchanges within the region of the entire Northeast play a significant role in supply and marketing work.

At the meeting, the Northeast Cooperative General Association also signed many joint operation contracts with provincial and municipal cooperatives. This will greatly improve operating capabilities, expand the scope of business, and make supply and marketing work no longer limited by the lack of funds. In terms of procurement, the General Association and Inner Mongolia jointly promote the sales of 2,000 heads of cattle and 1,000 sheep; and jointly promote the sales of 2,000 heads of cattle with Rehe, and jointly invest (5 billion yuan from the General Association, 3 billion yuan from Rehe) to establish a pig bristle and small intestine processing plant in the province to better promote the sales of pig bristles and small intestines, totaling approximately 329.9 billion yuan. In terms of trade, it has agreed with provincial and municipal cooperatives to jointly invest in purchasing New Year's goods such as jujubes, fresh ginger, children's hats and socks, and colorful floral fabrics from within the customs, totaling approximately 310 billion yuan. The joint venture contract also specifically stipulates the price, fund sharing, profit distribution, cost accounting, and other contents.

Under the business policy of mainly relying on the national economy, in addition to continuing to promote the sales of grain and local and sideline products to the state, in terms of trade, purchase orders have been submitted to departments such as the Ministry of Industry and the department store company to guarantee the supply of major materials. A transportation plan is now being formulated to ensure the timely completion of this winter's supply and marketing work.

East China Overfulfills Raw Cotton Purchase Plan

[Xinhua News Agency] The East China Regional Company of the China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company purchased a total of 900,700 dan of raw cotton from September to November 1950, exceeding the original plan by 32 percent.

In the early stage of the new cotton market in East China, the phenomenon of slow sales and private merchants lowering prices was common. In mid-September, state-owned companies, in conjunction with local cooperatives, went deep into townships to set up institutions and vigorously carried out purchase work. At the same time, the steps of the Joint Cotton Purchase Committee of East China public and private cotton mills were consistent, so since late September, the cotton-grain price ratio has always remained reasonable, encouraging the enthusiasm of the vast number of cotton farmers to sell cotton. The proportion of state-owned companies' purchases to the market turnover increased from 60 percent in September to more than 80 percent in October. In mid-November, the amount of cotton sold by cotton farmers increased even more. In order to meet the requirements of cotton farmers to exchange grain and other necessities, the state-owned cotton yarn cloth company and grain company in Zhejiang, and the cotton yarn cloth company and provincial cooperative general association in Shandong signed joint circular business contracts in early December and established a transfer account system. The cotton yarn cloth company pays the cotton farmers who sell flowers for grain purchase receipts according to the amount of cotton purchased, and the cotton farmers can use the receipts to collect grain from the local grain company or the grain company's sales units. The initial implementation of the contract has been well received by cotton farmers. State-owned companies in northern Jiangsu and southern Jiangsu are also preparing to establish a joint circular business contract system.

    展开棉粮物资交流活跃城乡经济

　　河北永年县合作社与国营贸易公司
    进行大规模赊购工作成功
    【新华社三日讯】河北省永年县合作社与国营贸易公司进行大规模的棉花赊购工作，既满足了棉农及时卖出手中所存棉花，以定期换回生活资料与生产资料的迫切要求；又解决了国营贸易公司与合作社不能立即用现金全部收回该地棉花的困难。
    永年县是河北省著名棉产区之一，植棉面积占该县耕地总面积的百分之三十一强。今年棉花丰收，收获量达三千四百万斤，绝大部分均需售出。今秋新棉上市后，国营贸易公司与合作社立即以现金收购一千五百万斤。这批现金总额达三百七十五亿元，以全县三十四万人口计，平均每人可得十一万元。这时，国营贸易公司与合作社为避免在短时间投放大量货币，引起物价波动，便停止以现金收购棉花。但棉农手中却仍积有大量棉花急需售出。国营贸易公司通过合作社向棉农进行赊购，以及由合作社向其社员赊购就是在这一情况下提出，并受到棉农热烈欢迎的一个办法。至十一月中旬，永年县合作社与国营贸易公司共已向农民赊购棉花一百八十万斤，约占农民手中尚存棉花量的百分之十。
    该地赊购办法共有四种，是与存实信用及代征公粮结合进行的。一种是临时赊购：社员将棉花临时存于合作社，确定时间，到期要货币或要实物。如要货币、听涨不听落；要实物，则按当日牌价交换。二是定期存实。把社员存入的棉花一律折成标准棉，确定一定利息，期满根据存户实际需要，付给实物（粮、棉布等）或货币。三是存实易货。由社员和合作社先把棉花与交换的物品作好价，到期清账，不行息。四是存实代征。社员把棉花存于社内，由合作社代交公粮，不行息。这四种办法，均能使棉农将多余的棉花，以合理价格赊出或售出，到一定时期后换得自己所需要的物品或取回货币。同时又使国营贸易公司与合作社不致因全用现金收买棉花，致短期投放货币太多，引起物价波动。
    进行赊购的主要关键是国营贸易公司与合作社信用关系的建立。去年春季该县合作社曾为国营贸易公司代购军布，当社员已织好大批布，而国营贸易公司购布的粮食未运到时，该县合作社便采用了社员先交军布再定期凭条取粮的赊购办法，信用很好，有的社员过期仍不取粮，合作社便主动地将存户换粮条转为存实条予以行息。因此，此次赊购棉花时，社员都信任合作社。该县窦下乡合作社在此次赊购中，能准时按赊购合同付给社员物品或货币，因此信用日高，社员愿赊购的户数更多，赊棉数量更大，赊给时间也更长。
　　东北合作总社交流各省土特产
    【本报讯】东北合作总社为了大量推销社员农、副业产品与供给社员需要，一九五○年第四季度开始以后，即集中力量加强了采购贸易工作，预定自十二月至一九五一年二月底收购十三万吨粮食。据辽西、松江、黑龙江三省统计，已经收购九千二百五十九吨。已运出二千一百九十吨。四万吨豆饼的收购计划，除由各级合作社附属企业开始加工外，已运进关一百八十吨，同时为了解决松江农民小麦销路，总社向松江省社订购面粉三万袋，并采购豆腐干七十万斤。在供给社员需要上，十二月内已由关内运到皮棉二十二万斤，各种布二万一千多匹，分发给各下级社。
    同时为了更好的完成冬季供销工作，在一九五○年十二月初召开的全东北合作社的业务会议上，曾进行了东北合作社间的物资交流。打破了过去各地供求互不相通的现象。各个兄弟合作社间首先签订了三十九份交换合同，其中有白条猪、鱼、小麦、大米、苹果、大海米等十八种，共计金额约二千五百八十五亿元（东北币，下同）。这里就是把北满大批的猪、粮食供给南满的城市，南满的特产——苹果、花生供给北满。说明全东北的区内物资交流对供销工作起了重大作用。
    会上东北合作总社又与各省市社间签订了许多联合经营合同。这将大大提高了经营能力，扩大了业务范围，使供销工作不再受到资金少的限制。如采购方面，总社和内蒙共同推销牛二千头，羊一千只；与热河联合推销牛二千头，并合资（总社五十亿元、热河三十亿元）在该省成立猪鬃、小肠加工厂，以便更好推销猪鬃和小肠，合计金额约三千二百九十九亿元。在贸易方面，已与各省市社协议共同出资到关内联合采购江枣、鲜姜、小孩帽袜及各色花布等年货，共计金额约三千一百亿元。联营合同中，还具体规定了价格、资金分担利润分配、成本核算等内容。
    在主要依靠国家经济的业务方针下，除继续向国家推销粮食与土副产品外，在贸易方面，已向工业部、百货公司等部门提出订货单，保证主要物资的供应。现在正在制订运输计划，以保证及时完成今冬供销工作。
　　华东超额完成原棉收购计划
    【新华社讯】中国花纱布公司华东区公司于一九五○年九至十一月份共收购原棉九十万零七百担，超过原定计划百分之三十二。
    华东地区新棉上市初期，曾普遍发生滞销和私商杀价现象。九月中旬，国营公司结合各地合作社深入乡镇设立机构，大力展开收购工作，同时与华东公私营纱厂联合购棉委员会的步调取得一致，因此九月下旬以来，棉粮比价始终保持合理，鼓励了广大棉农售棉的积极性。国营公司收购量与市场成交量的比例由九月份的百分之六十增至十月份的百分之八十以上。十一月中旬棉农售棉量益形增加。为了满足棉农换取粮食及其它必需品的要求，浙江的国营花纱布公司和粮食公司，山东的花纱布公司和省合作总社于十二月初旬分别签订了联环业务合同，建立了转帐往来的制度。花纱布公司按照所收购的棉花数量，付给售花棉农购粮单据，棉农凭单至当地粮食公司或粮食公司代销单位领取粮食。合同初步实行的结果，棉农反映很好。现苏北苏南等地的国营公司也正准备建立联环业务合同制。
