　　Jiluan River defenses repeatedly vandalized
    Relevant departments should pay close attention to protection
Comrade Editor:
    In the past year, the Jiluan River system, including the Jiyun, Chaobai, Beiyun, Jiangan, and Wu Rivers, has repeatedly experienced theft and damage to river defense pilings, materials, equipment, sluice gates, and dams. Although the provincial government, the River Affairs Bureau, and local governments have explicitly prohibited these activities, they continue to occur. I hope relevant departments will take effective measures to protect state property and river defense security.
    As early as after the flood season of 1949, trees and willow branches protecting the banks of the Beiyun River in Wuqing County were found to have been cut down and stolen by lawless elements. Last spring, over a thousand bank protection small pilings were lost along the Wu River on the left bank within the boundaries of Sanhe County. Last autumn, about a hundred wooden pilings, removed from the breach at Shangzhuangzi on the right bank of the Jiyun River in Baodi County, were stolen and dug up by Liu Guifen and 15 other households from that village. Wang Molin and Yang Jingfang from Shaolinkou and Fulizhuang in Ji County, who were hired to guard materials in the area, stole wooden boards themselves. Hundreds of bank protection wooden pilings have been lost along the Wu River on the right bank within the boundaries of Sanhe, in Yanggezhuang, Xidatun, and Hujiangzhuang (100 from Yanggezhuang alone). Most or all of the water curtains and bank protection equipment at Songzhuang, Da Xiaoxinzhuang, Xiaohekou, Xinan Town, and Sanwangzhuang along the left bank of the Jiyun River within Yutian have been stolen. Trees and windbreak small pilings along the abandoned Jiangan River channel have mostly been cut down. Similar incidents have occurred frequently elsewhere. It is understood that criminals in Fengzhuangzi, Baodi, and elsewhere have prepared small saws, declaring they will saw off the bank protection pilings at Songzhuang, Yutian, on the opposite bank. Their disregard for the law has reached this point! Some of these incidents have been handled, but many have not been dealt with properly, thus failing to stop such illegal behavior. For example, over a thousand wooden pilings were lost from the Wu River bank protection within Sanhe County. The main culprits, Sun Si and Qi You from Majiawo, Xianghe County, were captured twice. The court handled the case but has not announced the results of the punishment. Wang Zhan from Xisizhuang, Baodi, dismantled the Laogaozhai water curtain to make a fire. Although Liu Zhenpeng from Laogaozhai caught him and Liu Ju, a member of the county construction section, sent him to be dealt with, the government of that jurisdiction did not investigate the matter further.
    This behavior of undermining the people's economic construction should arouse our high vigilance. I suggest that river affairs agencies at all levels and local governments should quickly organize villages along the embankments to formulate covenants for the protection of river defenses, strengthen education among the masses on the protection of river defenses, and hand over those caught damaging and stealing to local courts for severe punishment in accordance with the law. Appropriate rewards should also be given to those who apprehend such individuals.
                                           Jiluan River Affairs Bureau Ren Jie

### 蓟滦河防屡遭破坏  有关部门应切实注意保护

　　蓟滦河防屡遭破坏
    有关部门应切实注意保护编辑同志：
    蓟滦河系所属的蓟运、潮白、北运、箭杆、武河等主要河流，在近一年来关于河防桩料器材及闸坝等，曾屡次发现偷盗及破坏的事情。虽经省府，河务局及当地政府明令制止，但近来仍有发现。我希望有关部门应作出切实有效的措施，以保护国家财产及河防安全。
    早在一九四九年汛期过后，北运河武清县段内的树木及护岸柳枝，即曾发现被不法分子砍伐及偷窃。去年春季，武河左岸三河县界内，曾丢失护岸小桩千余根。同年秋季，蓟运河右岸宝坻县尚庄子决口处拔下的木桩，被该村刘桂芬等十六户偷窃及挖掘约有百根。蓟县少林口王墨林及福里庄杨景芳，是被雇在该地看守材料的，却自盗木板。武河右岸三河界内杨各庄、西达屯、虎将庄等护岸木桩丢失数百根（杨各庄一处即一百根）。蓟运河左岸玉田界内宋庄、大小辛庄、小河口、新安镇、三王庄等处迎水帘子及护岸设备，大部或全部被偷走了。箭杆河故道的树木及防风小桩，则多被砍伐。他处类似的事件，亦层出不穷。据了解宝坻冯庄子不法分子等已将小锯备好，扬言去锯对岸玉田宋庄的护岸桩。其目无法律，已至于此！这些事情的发生，有的虽经过处理，但多未能得当，因而未能制止此种不法行为。如三河县界内武河护岸丢了木桩千余根，曾两次捕获主犯香河县马家窝孙四、祁佑二人，经法院处理，但未曾公布惩处结果。宝坻西四庄王占拆毁老高寨水帘子烘火，虽经老高寨刘振朋拿获，由县建设科员刘举送办，但该管区政府却不加深究。
    这种破坏人民经济建设的行为，应引起我们的高度警惕。我建议各级河务机关及当地政府应速组织沿堤村庄订出保护河防的公约，加强对群众保护河防的教育，对拿获的破坏者与偷窃分子应送交当地法院，依法严惩。并对拿获者加以适当奖励。
