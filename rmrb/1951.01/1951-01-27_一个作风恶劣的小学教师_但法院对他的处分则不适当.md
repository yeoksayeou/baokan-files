　　An Elementary School Teacher with a Bad Work Style
    But the Court's Punishment Was Inappropriate
    Editor:
    Wang Hongwen, an elementary school teacher in Beihuzhuang Village, Huolu County, is over fifty years old and has been teaching elementary school for twenty-one years. However, since liberation, due to his failure to study diligently and earnestly implement the people's government's cultural and educational policies, he still maintains a severe system of corporal punishment in the management of children. Students are subjected to various forms of corporal punishment for even minor mistakes, or even for talking and playing. Corporal punishment methods include hitting hands with wooden boards, kicking, slapping, forcing students to kneel, and other disguised forms of corporal punishment. Students Zhang Erqing and Zhang Bingsui were ordered by Wang Hongwen to place their hands on the corner of the desk and hit them hard with a wooden board for a small mistake, causing their hands to swell. Student Zhang Tiaohuo threw a stone into a lime pit used for building houses. Wang immediately ordered him to jump into the lime pit. The student was unwilling but was beaten severely by Wang. After the student jumped in, he was covered in lime and his feet were stuck in the pit, unable to get out. Furthermore, elementary school students are often severely beaten or forced to kneel for not recognizing a single character. Wang Hongwen also frequently intimidated students in meetings, falsely claiming: "The superiors have issued orders that if you make trouble, you will be beaten. The newspaper said that anyone who is naughty will be executed!" As a result of this corporal punishment, the children are unwilling and afraid to go to school. The masses are very dissatisfied with Wang Hongwen's corporal punishment of students. They stated: "Children go to school to learn to read, not to be beaten."
    In addition, Wang Hongwen's work style is very bad. When he has no vegetables to eat, he makes the students bring them to him. When he has no firewood to burn, he makes the students gather it. Furthermore, to encourage students to bring more vegetables, he praises students who bring a lot of vegetables and gather a lot of firewood on the blackboard newspaper, and criticizes students who bring less, telling them to emulate the "good students." He also buys and sells students' stationery supplies, exploiting them for profit, and embezzling office funds for his own benefit.
    The above situation has been verified by the county people's government. The county people's court has given the following punishment to Wang Hongwen for his serious violation of policy: (1) a sentence of ten months of imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for five years; (2) Wang Hongwen will publicly admit his mistakes and apologize at a mass meeting in Beihuzhuang Village, and the county bureau of culture and education will circulate a notice to all districts and village schools in the county regarding his violations of the law in order to prevent similar occurrences; (3) the embezzled funds will be confiscated and turned over to the public.
        Huolu County People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education

    Editor's Note: According to the letter from the Huolu County People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, an elementary school teacher with a bad work style like Wang Hongwen cannot educate the next generation of New China. It is necessary to give such a person appropriate criticism and education. However, the sentence of ten months of imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for five years is inappropriate and should be changed. More importantly, the Huolu County People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education should carefully inspect the elementary school education work in the entire county, paying particular attention to the training and improvement of elementary school teachers by the Bureau of Culture and Education, as well as the transformation and education work for teachers like Wang Hongwen, in order to find a thorough solution to this problem.

### 一个作风恶劣的小学教师  但法院对他的处分则不适当

　　一个作风恶劣的小学教师
    但法院对他的处分则不适当编辑同志：
    获鹿县北胡庄村小学教员王鸿文，今年五十多岁了，教了二十一年小学。但是，解放后由于不努力学习，不认真执行人民政府的文教政策，在对儿童的管理上仍然存在着严重的体罚制度。学生只要犯了错，甚至因为说话闹着玩，便会受到各式各样的体罚。体罚的方式有用木板打手、脚踢、掌打、罚跪以及其他变相体罚等。学生张二庆、张丙岁因为犯了一点小错误，王鸿文便命令该生将手放在桌子角上拿起木板用力打，把手都打肿了。学生张跳伙因将一块石头扔在修建房舍淋石灰的坑内，王即命其跳下灰坑去，该生不愿跳，遭王痛打，该生跳下去后，满身弄得都是石灰，把脚陷在坑内出不来。其次，小学生们常常因为一个字不认识而遭受毒打或罚跪。王鸿文并且时常在会上威吓学生，捏造说：“上级来了命令，你们捣乱就叫打你们。报上说谁挑皮捣乱就枪毙了谁！”这样体罚的结果，使得孩子们都不愿意和不敢上学了。群众对于王鸿文的体罚学生都非常不满，他们表示：“孩子上学为了识字，不是为了挨打。”
    此外，王鸿文的作风是很不好的。他没菜吃了就让学生给送，没柴烧了就让学生去拾。并且为了鼓励学生多拿菜，在黑板报上表扬送菜多、拾柴多的学生，批评送得少的学生，让他们向“好学生”看齐。他还买卖学生文具用品，从中剥削，贪污办公费自肥等。
    上述情况，经县人民政府调查属实。县人民法院对王鸿文严重违犯政策的行为给予了以下处分：（一）处有期徒刑十个月，褫夺公权五年；（二）王鸿文在北胡庄村群众大会上公开承认错误与道歉，并由县文教科将其违犯法令事实通报全县各区、村学校以戒类似事情之发生；（三）贪污款项归公。
        获鹿县人民政府文教科                
    编者按：从获鹿县人民政府文教科来信看，象王鸿文这样作风不好的小学教师，确实不能教育新中国的下一代。对这样的人给予适当批评教育是必要的。但判处十个月徒刑，并褫夺公权五年的处分是不适当的，应加以改变。更主要的是，获鹿县人民政府文教科应认真检查全县的小学教育工作，特别注意文教科对小学教员的培养和提高，以及对王鸿文这样的教员的改造教育工作，从而找出彻底解决这一问题的办法。
