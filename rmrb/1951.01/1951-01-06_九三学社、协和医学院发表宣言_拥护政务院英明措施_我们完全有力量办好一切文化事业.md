　　Jiusan Society
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Jiusan Society issued a statement entitled "Striving to Thoroughly Eliminate the Cultural Aggression Forces of U.S. Imperialism in China," supporting the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council regarding the policy of handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups accepting U.S. subsidies. It stated: Just as U.S. imperialism is baring its fangs and claws to invade our Taiwan, bomb our Northeast, and suffer shameful defeats in the Korean War, the U.S. government has brazenly announced the freezing of the assets of our people in the United States and is threatening the livelihoods of personnel in churches, schools, hospitals, and other organizations receiving U.S. subsidies by suspending subsidies, attempting to create difficulties for our People's Government in running education and relief undertakings. In order to eliminate the economic and cultural aggression of U.S. imperialism in China, our Central People's Government's Government Administration Council recently issued a policy and implementation measures regarding the handling of cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups accepting U.S. subsidies. This measure is entirely correct and necessary, and at the same time, it demonstrates to U.S. imperialism that the Chinese people are not to be insulted, and any threats and intimidation are not only futile but also make the Chinese people more clearly recognize the true face of U.S. imperialism.

    We firmly support this just measure of the Government Administration Council, which represents the will and interests of the people. Most of the members of our society serve in the cultural and educational fields and have a relatively deep understanding and experience of the cultural aggression implemented by U.S. imperialism in China. The purpose of U.S. imperialism in running religious, cultural, educational, medical, and relief undertakings in China is to coordinate with its political, economic, and armed aggression. Despite disguising itself as a philanthropist, it can never conceal its wolfish nature. Since the policy of the U.S. imperialists directly helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to massacre the Chinese people met with failure, it has carried out a series of shameful threats and intimidation against the Chinese people. But we want to tell the U.S. imperialists that the Chinese people who have stood up will never be deceived and threatened by you. Under the leadership of their own government, the Chinese people can completely rely on their own strength to run those organizations, and they have absolute confidence that they will run them better than before.

    We call on the members of our society on the cultural front to assist the government in implementing the decision regarding the policy of handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups accepting U.S. subsidies, thoroughly eliminate the cultural aggression forces of U.S. imperialism in China, and strive to build an independent, autonomous, free, and happy New China!
            
            Peking Union Medical College

    [Reported by this newspaper] All staff and students of Peking Union Medical College issued the following declaration in support of the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council regarding the handling of cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups accepting U.S. subsidies: Ever since Austin slandered the Chinese people in the United Nations, Chinese church hospitals and schools immediately gave him a powerful counterattack. But U.S. imperialism not only did not repent but instead intensified its efforts, freezing the funds of the Chinese people in the United States and ceasing to subsidize Chinese church hospitals and schools, in order to threaten the Chinese people. It can be seen that what U.S. imperialism sees is only money, buying people with money, and threatening people with money. But the Chinese people who have stood up absolutely do not care about this paltry amount. Vice Premier Guo Moruo's report at the Government Administration Council and the Government Administration Council's decision gave a powerful counterattack to this move by U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people have the strength and determination to manage their own affairs well, and they do not need the hypocritical concern of imperialism, nor are they afraid of their empty threats. Our Peking Union Medical College used to be funded by U.S. imperialism and unknowingly became a tool of imperialist cultural aggression. Since liberation, the awareness of staff and students has increased, and they have long wanted to throw off the shackles of imperialism. Since the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, patriotic sentiments have become even higher, and we are especially resentful to hear that U.S. imperialism is treating us by freezing the funds of the Chinese people in the United States. We wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Guo's report and the Government Administration Council's decision. Our Peking Union Medical College is now returning to the embrace of the people of the motherland, which is infinitely joyful, and it truly feels like seeing the clear sky after pushing aside the clouds. Under the leadership of the People's Government, all our staff and students must unite sincerely to run Peking Union Medical College better than in the past, so that U.S. imperialism will hear it and be disheartened. This is the common goal of all our staff and students.

　　九三学社、协和医学院发表宣言
    拥护政务院英明措施
    我们完全有力量办好一切文化事业
           九三学社
    【本报讯】九三学社以“为彻底肃清美帝国主义在中国的文化侵略势力而奋斗”为题发表声明，拥护中央人民政府政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定。略称：正当美帝国主义张牙舞爪侵略我台湾、轰炸我东北以及在侵朝战争中遭受到可耻的失败以后，美国政府竟悍然宣布冻结我国人民在美的资产，并以停发补助费来威胁那些接受美国津贴的教会、学校和医院等机关中的人员的生活，企图借此制造我人民政府办理教育和救济事业的困难。我中央人民政府政务院为肃清美帝在中国的经济和文化侵略的影响，于日前发布了关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针及实施办法。这个措施是完全正确的、必要的，同时向美帝国主义表示中国人民是不可侮的，任何威胁和恫吓不但是徒然的，而且使中国人民更清楚地认识了美帝国主义的真面目。
    我们坚决拥护政务院这个正义的、代表人民意志和利益的措施。本社同人大都服务文化教育界，对于美帝国主义在中国所施行的文化侵略，有着比较深切的认识和体会。美帝国主义在中国办理宗教、文化、教育、医疗、救济等事业的目的，就是要配合他的政治、经济和武装侵略。尽管它伪装着慈善家的面孔，但绝不能掩饰豺狼的本质。自从美帝直接帮助蒋介石匪帮屠杀中国人民的政策遭遇到失败以后，它接二连三地对中国人民进行了可耻的威胁和恫吓。但是我们要正告美帝：站起来了的中国人民是决不会受你们的欺骗和威胁的。中国人民在自己的政府领导之下，完全可以依靠自己的力量来办理那些机关，而且有绝对的信心一定会办得比原来更好。
    我们号召本社同人在文化战线上协助政府实施关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定，彻底肃清美帝国主义在中国的文化侵略势力，为建立一个独立、自主、自由、幸福的新中国而奋斗！
            协和医学院
    【本报讯】北京协和医学院全体员工学生为拥护中央人民政府政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定，特发表如下宣言：自从奥斯汀在联合国里诬蔑了中国人民之后，中国各教会医院学校马上给他一个有力的反击。但是美帝国主义非但不知悔改，反而变本加厉，冻结了中国人民在美的资金，停止资助中国的教会医院学校，借以威胁中国人民。可见美帝国主义所看见的只是金钱，收买人用金钱，威吓人也用金钱。但是站起来了的中国人民绝不稀罕这戔戔之数。郭沫若副总理在政务院的报告以及政务院的决定，给美帝国主义这一举措一个有力的反击。中国人民有力量而且有决心办好自己的事情，不需要帝国主义的虚假关怀，亦不怕他们的虚声恫吓。我们协和医学院过去曾受美帝国主义的资助，不知不觉做了帝国主义文化侵略的工具。自从解放以后，员工学生的觉悟提高了，早想摔掉帝国主义的枷锁。抗美援朝运动以来，爱国情绪更是高涨，听到美帝国主义用冻结中国人民在美资金的方法对待我们，尤为切齿痛恨。对于郭副总理的报告以及政务院的决定，万分热情拥护。我们协和医学院今后归到祖国人民的怀抱里，是无限欢欣，真有拨开云雾见青天的感觉。我们全体员工学生在人民政府领导之下，精诚团结一定要把协和医学院办得比过去更好，让美帝国主义听到嗒然丧气，这就是我们全体员工学生的共同目标。
