　　War-profiteer Dulles Goes to Japan
　　Plots Separate Peace Treaty with Japan
Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The notorious war-profiteer Dulles, in the capacity of "special representative" of U.S. President Truman, arrived in Tokyo on the 25th from the United States to further plot a separate peace treaty with Japan, in order to expedite the re-armament of Japan as an important step in the U.S.'s preparation for a war of aggression. Accompanying Dulles were U.S. Department of Defense representative Johnson, Director of the Northeast Asian Affairs Division of the State Department, Allison, and others. According to a statement issued by the U.S. State Department on the 11th, Dulles will "represent the United States in further discussions and negotiations necessary to facilitate the final conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan."
　　As is well known, since the Truman administration instructed the State Department on September 14 to intensify activities for a separate peace treaty with Japan, Dulles has been in frequent contact with representatives of the member states of the Far Eastern Commission in New York, and has submitted to them a seven-point plan for a separate peace treaty with Japan in the form of a memorandum. This plan blatantly shows that the U.S. government wants to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, infringe upon China's territorial sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and the Soviet Union's territorial sovereignty over the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin Island. U.S. troops will continue to be stationed in Japan after the peace treaty, and Japan's armed forces will be openly established. This U.S. plan was thoroughly exposed by the Soviet government's memorandum of November 20 last year. Our Foreign Minister Zhou also issued a statement on December 4 last year, denouncing the U.S.'s unreasonable and illegal position on the Japanese peace treaty issue, and announced that the Central People's Government considers any preparation and drafting of a peace treaty with Japan without the participation of the People's Republic of China to be illegal and therefore invalid, regardless of its content and outcome.

### 战贩杜勒斯赴日  策动单独对日媾和

　　战贩杜勒斯赴日
    策动单独对日媾和
    【新华社二十六日讯】臭名远扬的战争贩子杜勒斯，以美国总统杜鲁门的“特别代表”的身份，于二十五日自美国抵东京，进一步策动单独对日媾和，以便加急重新武装日本，作为美国准备侵略战争的重要步骤。与杜勒斯同行者尚有美国国防部代表江生、国务院东北亚洲司司长艾利逊等人。据美国国务院十一日发表的声明称：杜勒斯将“代表美国进行为了促成对日和约的最后缔结所必需的进一步讨论与谈判”。
    如所周知，自杜鲁门政府于九月十四日指令国务院加紧进行单独对日媾和的活动以来，杜勒斯即在纽约与远东委员会各会员国的代表频繁接触，并以备忘录的形式，向它们提出了美国对日单独媾和的七点方案。该方案露骨地表明，美国政府要对日本单独媾和，侵犯中国台湾、澎湖列岛的领土主权与苏联千岛群岛与库页岛的领土主权，美军在媾和后继续留驻日本，公开建立日本的武装部队。美国这方案，已被苏联政府去年十一月二十日的备忘录所彻底揭穿。我周外长亦于去年十二月四日发表声明，斥责美国在对日和约问题上无理的非法的立场，宣布对日和约的准备与拟制如果没有中华人民共和国参加的，无论其内容与结果如何，中央人民政府一概认为是非法的，因而是无效的。
