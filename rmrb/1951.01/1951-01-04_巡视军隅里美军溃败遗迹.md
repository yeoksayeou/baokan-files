Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, January 3rd: A delayed dispatch: Our correspondent at the Korean front reports: The highway between Kunyu-ri and Sunchon is the graveyard of several units of the U.S. invading army's Second Division, Twenty-fifth Division, and Turkish Brigade. Not long after the battle in this area ended, the reporter inspected the ruins of the American invaders and their accomplices' defeat. On a large river滩 southwest of Kunyu-ri, there were piles of large quantities of weapons and vehicles abandoned by the invading army during their retreat. Cannons, tanks, and cars were scattered in a chaotic mess on the sand. The highway was also blocked by the equipment abandoned by the U.S. military, and only agile small jeeps could barely pass through, and in some places they had to go around from under the highway. The cars abandoned by the enemy were one after another, like a long snake that had been beaten to death, paralyzed on the highway. Many cars crashed their heads into the rear of the cars in front, and many more cars were overturned on the side of the road. The giant howitzers, although still gaping with their bloodthirsty mouths, had completely lost their original "majesty". The destroyed tanks and the killed invading officers and soldiers were lying crookedly on the highway and the roadside. The white snow was like a boundless quilt, covering up the various murderous weapons discarded in embarrassment by the enemy and the ugly corpses of the robbers. In this battle, many of the invading troops were scattered and fled in all directions, in groups of three or five like stray dogs. But they still could not escape the giant palms of the people's fighters. Once, three photographers, Liu Deyuan, Su Zhongyi, and Sun Shu, etc., who accompanied the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, also captured three American stragglers who resisted with guns after a small encounter.

The American invading bandits made very careful arrangements for their so-called "general offensive". They installed cameras on jeeps, dreaming of coming to the front line to shoot the "victory" scenes of the general offensive. Naturally, they were disappointed. The reporter saw two jeeps in the pile of vehicles abandoned by the enemy. The cameras were gone, but the poles for installing the cameras were still standing upright on the cars. All this has become an interesting scene for the photographers accompanying the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

### 巡视军隅里美军溃败遗迹

　　巡视军隅里美军溃败遗迹
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地三日电】迟到：本社朝鲜前线记者报道：从军隅里到顺川间的公路上，是美国侵略军第二师、第二十五师和土耳其旅的若干部队被歼灭的坟场。这一地区的战斗结束不久，记者巡视了美国侵略者及其帮凶者溃败的遗迹。在军隅里西南的一片很大的河滩上，堆满了侵略军溃退时遗弃下来的大量武器和车辆。大炮、坦克、汽车乱七八糟地杂陈在沙滩上。公路也为美军遗弃下来的装备所阻塞，只有灵巧的小吉普才能勉强通过，有些地方还要从公路下边绕过去。敌人丢弃的汽车是一辆紧接着一辆，像一条被打死了的长蛇，瘫痪在公路上。许多汽车的头撞坏了前边汽车的尾部，又有许多汽车歪倒在路旁。巨型榴弹炮虽然还是张着它的血盆大嘴，可是完全失去了它原来的“威风”。被击毁的坦克和被击毙的侵略军官兵，横七竖八地歪躺在公路上和路旁。白雪像是一床漫无边际的被子，把敌人狼狈丢弃的各种杀人武器和强盗们的丑恶尸体覆盖起来。在这次战斗中，不少的侵略军被打得东逃西散，三五成群如丧家之犬。但他们仍逃脱不了人民战士的巨掌。有一次，随我国人民志愿军的摄影记者刘德源、苏中义、孙树相等三人。经过一场小的遭遇战，也捕捉了三个持枪抵抗的美国溃兵。
    美国侵略强盗们给他们的所谓“总攻势”安排得十分周到。他们把开麦拉按装在吉普车上，梦想到前线来拍摄总攻势的“胜利”镜头，自然，他们是失望了。记者在敌人丢弃的车辆堆中看到有两辆吉普车，开麦拉是没有了，但按装开麦拉的杆子却还在车上朝天竖着。这一切，已成为随中国人民志愿军的摄影记者们所感到有趣的镜头。
