　　City Party Committees Should Pay Attention to Resident Propaganda Work
　　Zhong Liu
　　At present, propaganda work in cities generally remains focused on workers and students, while the extremely important work of resident propaganda has not attracted serious attention from city Party committees. Even if some Party committees have taken notice, it is still limited to temporary propaganda efforts.

　　The importance of resident propaganda work in cities is obvious. In terms of population proportion, in some cities with few industrial workers, or in urban areas with few workers, students, and government employees, residents often account for 80 to 90 percent of the city's population. Taking the population of Beijing's Third District as an example, the entire district has more than 216,000 people, of which residents account for more than 197,000, accounting for over 90 percent of the district's population. Moreover, the composition of residents is complex: there are workers' families, shop assistants, independent laborers, freelancers, merchants, and people from other social strata; their thinking is also complex. For example, in the early stages of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, in addition to ideas like fear of America and worship of America, there were other backward ideas. However, many Party committees have neglected to use effective methods to solve this problem. The Beijing Third District Committee of the Communist Party of China is like this, so it has not yet established regular resident propaganda work to solve various ideological problems among residents and convey the Party's policies and instructions. At most, after the central work is deployed, they mobilize cultural centers, adult night schools, district women's federations, and district branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to carry out some temporary propaganda work.

　　The Beijing Third District Committee of the Communist Party of China's neglect of resident propaganda work can be seen from the division of labor in the district committee's propaganda work for Resist America, Aid Korea. At that time, the seven district committee members were divided as follows: the district committee secretary was in charge of the overall propaganda work, the propaganda committee member and two district committee members who served as middle school principals led school propaganda work, the organization committee member led the propaganda work of government organizations, and the two district committee members who served as district chief and head of the public security sub-bureau led daily work. The resident propaganda work was handed over to adult night schools, district women's federations, cultural and educational centers, and district branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which were led by the head of the cultural and educational section of the district office. The head of the cultural and educational section then handed over this task to a staff member; this staff member treated leading propaganda work as his incidental work. Therefore, apart from paying more attention to leading the current affairs study of adult night schools, no one led the propaganda work of other departments. Although this staff member called once a day to urge for reports; the leadership did not study or give instructions on the reports sent in. When the head of the cultural and educational section participated in the district's propaganda work leadership meeting, because he did not personally lead resident propaganda work, he could not raise any questions, and it was impossible to discuss and study resident propaganda work issues at the meeting. However, the Third District Committee did not inspect or correct this situation, and for a long time, the Party's propaganda work for residents was in a state of unguided drift.

　　In this way, the development of the Third District's Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work was naturally unbalanced and not in-depth. For example, in the five hutongs from East Fourth Head Street to Fifth Street under the jurisdiction of the Third Police Station, no one had ever carried out propaganda. Some activists became anxious and questioned the police station. According to statistics from the Third District, during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, a total of 110,000 residents in the district were affected by propaganda, but some of them were double-counted in the statistics.

　　There are reasons why the Third District Committee of the Communist Party of China neglects resident propaganda work: first of all, the district committee has not realized that the Party's propaganda work must be done well by mobilizing all Party members. The Third District Committee mistakenly believes that there are few Party members in the streets and that they have low awareness and no ability to undertake propaganda work. Among them, some Party members may not yet have the ability to undertake propaganda work, but not all street Party members do not have the ability to undertake propaganda work. In particular, some Party committee members emphasize that street Party members have low political awareness and cannot yet be propaganda officers. This is inappropriate. Of course, when some Party members carry out propaganda, they may not be able to explain the reasons in lengthy speeches for a while, but street Party members have favorable conditions for carrying out resident propaganda work, they are familiar with the ideological situation and living habits of residents. If the Party committee can educate these Party members about propaganda knowledge, then these Party members are fully capable of completing the Party's propaganda tasks. Doing propaganda work is the duty of every Party member, and they will certainly work hard to do this work.

　　Some Party committee members say that the main task of the city Party committee is to lead production, that is to say, it should mainly conduct propaganda among workers. Yes, the task of the city Party committee is to lead production, mainly to conduct propaganda and education among workers; but it does not mean that there is no need to lead residents, and some of these residents are families of workers and staff members and independent laborers, they are also producers. At the same time, we are transforming the consuming city into a producing city. In this way, there is even less reason to neglect propaganda work for residents.

　　Some Party committee members have shown that they are satisfied with the vigorous propaganda activities and propaganda achievements of the propaganda teams of universities and middle schools. This is also one of the reasons for neglecting resident propaganda work. But now residents need more than just temporary propaganda work, but regular propaganda work. Now residents urgently need to understand the domestic and international situation and government policies and regulations. But some Party committee members want to say that mobilizing students is also for carrying out propaganda work for residents. This shows that some Party committee members still believe that if they want to carry out propaganda work for residents, they have to rely on student propaganda teams. In this way, some Party committees will not fail to ignore such things: for example, in the Third District, two sections of street people's representatives spontaneously organized propaganda groups during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, printed propaganda materials, and carried out propaganda work among residents. The district committee also knew about this, but did not take the initiative to lead this propaganda activity, and even did not know the specific situation of these street people's representatives' activities.

　　The city Party committee has reached the time when it should pay attention to resident propaganda work and should establish regular propaganda work among residents, as pointed out in the Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party."

### 城市党委应该注意居民宣传工作

　　城市党委应该注意居民宣传工作
    中流
    目前城市的宣传工作，一般的还停留在工人、学生中间，而极为重要的居民宣传工作，没有引起党委严重的注意；即使有些党委注意了，也还限于作一些临时性的宣传工作。
    城市居民宣传工作的重要性是很显然的。按照人口比例来说，在有些产业工人不多的城市，或城市中工人、学生、机关工作人员不多的市区，居民往往占城市人口百分之八九十。以北京市三区人口来说，全区共有二十一万六千余人，而其中居民即有十九万七千余人，占全区人口的百分之九十强。并且居民成份复杂：有职工家属、店员、独立劳动者、自由职业者、商人及其他阶层人士；思想也复杂，例如在抗美援朝运动初期，除了恐美、崇美等思想外，还有其他落后思想。但是许多党委忽视了用有效的办法解决这个问题。中共北京市三区区委就是如此，所以至今还没有建立起经常的居民宣传工作，解决居民中的各种思想问题与传达党的政策与指示。最多在中心工作布置下来后，他们发动文化馆、成人夜校、区妇联、中苏友好协会区分会进行一些临时性的宣传工作。
    中共北京市三区区委轻视居民宣传工作，是可以从区委对抗美援朝的宣传工作分工上看出来。当时七个区委委员是这样分工的：区委书记掌握全盘宣传工作，宣传委员与两个担任中学校长的区委委员领导学校宣传工作，组织委员领导机关宣传工作，担任区长与担任公安分局长的两位区委委员领导日常工作，工厂宣传工作由工会副主任领导，把居民宣传工作则交给了成人夜校、区妇联、文教馆、中苏友好协会区分会去负责，由区公所文教科长领导。文教科长又把这个任务交给一位科员；这位科员又把领导宣传工作当作了自己的附带工作。因此，除了比较注意领导了成人夜校的时事学习外，对其他部门的宣传工作就没人去领导。虽然这位科员也从电话上每天催一次汇报；但领导上对送来的汇报不研究不指示。文教科长参加区的宣传工作领导会议时，因为自己没有亲身领导居民宣传工作，就提不出什么问题来，会上也就无法来讨论研究居民宣传工作问题。但是三区区委对这种状态也不检查不纠正，长期的使党对居民的宣传工作处于无领导的自流状态。
    这样三区的抗美援朝的宣传工作发展当然不平衡与不深入的。例如第三派出所所辖的东四头条至五条等五条胡同里，就没有人去宣传过。有些积极分子就着急的去质问派出所。据三区统计，在抗美援朝运动中，该区受到宣传影响的居民共有十一万人，但其中有一部分人在统计时是重复的。
    三区区委所以轻视居民宣传工作，是有原因的：首先区委没有认识到党的宣传工作，必须发动全体党员一起作才能作好。三区区委错误的认为街道党员人数少、并且觉悟低，没有能力担任宣传工作。其中可能有一部分党员还没有担任宣传工作的能力，但并不是所有街道党员没有担任宣传工作的能力的。特别是有的党委委员，强调街道党员政治觉悟低，还不能当宣传员。这是不恰当的。当然，有些党员在进行宣传时，可能一时讲不出长篇大论的道理来，但街道党员进行居民宣传工作具有有利条件，他们熟悉居民的思想情况与生活习惯。如果党委能够对这些党员进行一些关于宣传知识的教育，那末这些党员完全有能力来完成党的宣传任务的。作宣传工作是每一个党员的义务，他们也一定会努力去作这一工作的。
    有的党委委员说城市党委的主要任务是领导生产，也就是说主要应向工人进行宣传。是的，城市党委的任务是要领导生产，主要是向工人进行宣传教育；但并不是说，就不需领导居民，而且这些居民中有一部分是工人、职员的家属与独立劳动者，他们也是生产者。同时我们正在把消费的城市改造为生产的城市。这样更没有理由可以轻视对居民的宣传工作了。
    有些党委委员已表现出他们是满足于大中学校宣传队的轰轰烈烈的宣传活动及其宣传成绩。这也是轻视居民宣传工作原因之一。但是现在居民需要的已不止是临时的宣传工作，而需要经常的宣传工作，现在居民迫切要求了解国内外的形势与政府的政策法令。但是有些党委委员要说，发动学生也是为了对居民进行宣传工作。这说明了有些党委委员至今仍认为如果要对居民进行宣传工作，非得依靠学生宣传队不行。这样有些党委就不会不漠视这样的事情：如三区有两个段的街人民代表，在抗美援朝运动中，曾自动的组织了宣传小组，印发宣传品，在居民中间进行了宣传工作。区委也知道这件事情，但没有主动的去领导这一宣传活动，甚至连这些街人民代表活动的具体情况都不清楚。
    城市的党委，已到应该注意居民宣传工作的时候了，应该如中央《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》所指出的在居民中间，建立经常的宣传工作。
