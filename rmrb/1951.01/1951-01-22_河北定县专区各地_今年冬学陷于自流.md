　　Hebei Dingxian Special District's Various Areas
    This Year's Winter Literacy Campaign Falls into Self-Flow
    The farmer's literacy education in Hebei's Dingxian Special District has a foundation. Last winter, there were more than 270,000 students in people's schools in the twelve counties of the entire district. However, this year's winter literacy campaign is not as good as last year. According to incomplete statistics from Anping, Anguo, Xingtang, Xinle, Lixian, and Wuji counties, among 1,272 villages, 562 villages have established people's schools, and 98 villages have established literacy groups, with 28,771 students enrolled. Comparing this year's winter literacy campaign with last year's, it is clear that there is a downward trend. This is a problem worth noting. Why is it declining? We believe there are several reasons:
    First, leaders at all levels do not pay enough attention and have not truly recognized ideologically that only by improving the cultural level of the masses can we improve their political awareness. They do not recognize that people's schools are a powerful weapon to dispel the masses' ideological concerns, implement various policies, and promote work. They simply believe that "farmer's literacy education is not easy to carry out and cannot be achieved in a short period of time, so it can be postponed." Therefore, most counties have not seriously studied how to run the winter literacy campaign well and have not formulated specific plans, so the work of the people's schools has fallen into self-flow.
    Second, they are not good at closely integrating the central work with the winter literacy campaign. Many cadres emphasize that there is too much central work this winter and that there is no way to carry out the people's schools. These comrades have a "single-handed" working method. When cadres from the propaganda departments go to the countryside to carry out central work, they do not inspect or promote the work of the people's schools, believing that their task is to carry out central work, and they will be criticized if they do not complete the central work. It does not matter if they do not inspect or promote the winter literacy campaign, so often a cadre does not understand the situation of the people's schools in a village after staying there for ten and a half days.
    Third, the propaganda work is weak, and sufficient ideological mobilization has not been carried out. The ideological concerns of many village cadres, party members, and the masses have not been resolved. Some village cadres cannot put down their airs and are unwilling to go to people's schools to study with the masses. Party members have not played a leading role. Female comrades emphasize even more that there are too many household chores and that children are a burden, so they cannot go to people's schools.
    Fourth, they do not pay attention to discovering and cultivating teachers for the people's schools, and they lack ideological leadership for the existing teachers of the people's schools and fail to solve their difficulties in a timely manner, making some teachers of the people's schools afraid of delaying production and not actively teaching. Shenze County wanted to hold a meeting for teachers of the people's schools, but it could not be convened after several days of calling.
    Because the above problems have not been well resolved, the development of farmer's literacy education has been greatly affected. The Special District Literacy Committee is paying attention to finding ways to solve these problems. The central key is that cadres at all levels should pay attention to this work.

### 河北定县专区各地  今年冬学陷于自流

　　河北定县专区各地
    今年冬学陷于自流
    河北定县专区的农民识字教育是有基础的，去年冬全专区十二个县共有民校学员二十七万多，但是，今年冬学却不如去年了。据安平、安国、行唐、新乐、蠡县、无极六个县不完全的统计，一二七二个村中，建立民校的有五六二个村，建立识字小组的有九八个村，入校人数二万八千七百七十一人。把去年和今年冬学运动比较起来，显然已呈下降趋势。这是一个值得注意的问题，为什么会下降呢？我们觉得有以下几个原因：
    第一，各级领导不重视，没有真正从思想上认识只有提高群众的文化水平，才能提高其政治觉悟；不认识民校是解除群众思想顾虑，贯彻各种政策推动工作的有力武器。单纯的认为“农民识字教育不好搞，不是三天两早晨所能作出成绩的，可以向后推推”。因而，大多数县份未认真研究如何办好冬学，没有订出具体计划，所以，民校工作陷于自流。
    第二，不善于使中心工作与冬学密切结合，很多干部都强调今年冬天中心工作太多，没法搞民校。这些同志存在着“单打一”的工作方法。宣教部门的干部下乡搞中心工作时也不检查与推动民校工作，认为自己的任务是搞中心工作，完不成中心工作受批评，不检查不推动冬学工作没有事，所以往往一个干部在一个村住十天半月之后还不了解该村民校的情况。
    第三，宣传工作薄弱，未进行充分的思想动员。许多村干部党员和群众的思想顾虑未得到解决。部分村干部放不下架子，不愿和群众一块上民校学习。党员没起到带头作用。女同志更强调家务琐事多，孩子牵累不能上民校。
    第四，不注意发现与培养民校教师，对现有的民校教师缺乏思想领导和及时解决其困难，使得一部分民校教师怕耽误生产，教学不积极。深泽县要召开民校教师会议，召集了好几天开不起来。
    由于以上问题未很好解决，大大影响着农民识字教育的开展。专区识字委员会正注意设法解决这些问题。中心关键是在：各级干部应重视起这个工作来。
