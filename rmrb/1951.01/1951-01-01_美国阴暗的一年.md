Xinhua News Agency, New York, 30th TASS: The American people are welcoming the New Year with melancholy. Profound changes occurred in America in 1950. This can be seen in the outlines of President Truman's two speeches. In his January 1950 "State of the Union Address," Truman made many promises to the American people, hypocritically declaring "efforts to improve the lives of all." But in his broadcast on December 15, Truman's theme was "sacrifice."

　　In order to realize the plan to transform America into a militarist country, the American ruling group increased the Defense Department budget from approximately 14 billion to over 42 billion in 1950, abolished troop limits, extended military service, mobilized National Guard divisions, reactivated many previously decommissioned warships, aircraft, and tanks, and greatly accelerated the production of armaments, especially atomic weapons.

　　At the beginning of 1950, the American bourgeoisie was frequently worried about the crisis. However, by relying on the aggression against Korea and using this aggression as an excuse to implement economic mobilization measures, American imperialism temporarily avoided this danger. The massive military appropriations of the Department of Defense have greatly stimulated new factory investment and the production of heavy industry. According to Business Week, actual spending on armaments and other equipment in November increased by approximately 30 percent compared to the same month in 1949. According to the New York Times, radio and television equipment manufacturers received 1.2 billion US dollars in military electrical equipment orders in the past six months, and are expected to increase by 5 billion next year. Automobile manufacturers have received large orders for aircraft engines, tanks, and other military equipment.

　　In order to accelerate arms production and suppress the production of consumer goods, Truman, based on emergency decrees, began to divert various basic materials to war industries and implement strict credit restrictions. In the absence of materials, the production of consumer goods has been reduced or is planned to be reduced. Housing construction in November fell by 40 percent compared to July. Government experts predict that housing construction expenditures in 1951 will only be half of those in 1950.

　　Large companies have gained huge profits from the government's above-mentioned measures. Figures published by the "First National City Bank Bulletin" show that in the three months after the American invasion of Korea, American companies' profits exceeded the third quarter of 1949 by more than 54 percent. The profits of 500 companies in the third quarter of this year reached 1.56 billion US dollars. Among them, the profits of companies most closely related to war plans increased the fastest. According to estimates by the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the total after-tax profits of national companies for the whole year reached 22.4 billion US dollars, more than twice the highest year of World War II, 1944.

　　However, the broad masses of people have had to endure sacrifices: the cost of living has risen, taxes have increased, the "hurry-up" system has been intensified, living standards have fallen, and democratic rights have been further reduced. Even according to the reduced official figures of the U.S. Department of Labor, the cost of living in mid-November increased by 3.2 percent compared to mid-June. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, wholesale prices of all commodities have risen by about 10 percent. Wholesale prices of agricultural products and food have risen by almost 20 percent since the beginning of the year.

　　Since October, the number of unemployed has increased again, due to the government's cessation of raw material supplies to consumer goods industries and the conversion of certain factories for military production. The Department of Labor reported that the average number of new applications for unemployment relief in November was 186,000 per week, compared to 155,000 in October and 131,000 in September. The New York Times said: "Important officials admit that unemployment will be widespread in the first quarter of next year, and it does not seem possible to reduce unemployment before spring, no matter how it is planned." The U.S. Chamber of Commerce publication "Our Business" estimates that due to restrictions on housing construction, "one-fifth of construction workers must find other jobs."

　　The situation of American farmers has also deteriorated further over the past year. According to the Department of Agriculture's estimates, the total agricultural income in the first eleven months of this year was 1 percent lower than in the same period last year. This does not include the increase in the cost of living and the prices of agricultural implements, etc.

　　With the advance towards war, fascist tendencies in the American ruling class have also rapidly intensified. The Taft-Hartley Act has been enshrined in the legal code, coupled with an even more vicious McCarran Act. In 1950, the general secretary of the Communist Party, ten progressive writers in Hollywood, the leaders of the "Anti-Fascist Refugee Joint Committee," and many other progressives were imprisoned; progressive teachers were dismissed; many cities enacted local laws requiring communists to register; and terror against blacks and other minorities increased even more.

　　On December 10, the New York Times published an op-ed by its Washington correspondent Loftus, titled "America in 1951: What Will Our Lives Be Like?" Loftus depicted America's prospects as: an increase in the army; about 20 percent of national production allocated for war purposes; higher cost of living; lack of certain clothing; certain household goods disappearing; the quality of other goods declining; a sharp reduction in housing construction; a decrease in the manufacture of passenger cars; "many dislocations and many inconveniences" and a general decline in living standards.

　　It is no wonder that Americans view the New Year "with uneasy anxiety rather than with hope" in the face of such prospects, especially the growth of war hysteria and fascist tendencies.

　　美国阴暗的一年
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社纽约三十日讯：美国人民忧郁地迎接新年。一九五○年，在美国发生了深刻的变化。这可从杜鲁门总统的两次演说见其梗概。杜鲁门一九五○年一月的“国情咨文”，向美国人民作了许多诺许，伪善地宣布“为提高一切人的生活而努力”。但在十二月十五日的广播里，杜鲁门的主题却是“牺牲”。
    为了现实变美国为军国主义国家的计划，美国统治集团在一九五○年把国防部预算从约一百四十亿增加到四百二十亿以上，取消兵额限制，延长兵役，动员国民警卫队师，使许多前已解役的军舰、飞机和坦克复役，并大大加速军备特别是原子武器的生产。
    一九五○年初的时候，美国资产阶级经常担忧着危机。但是靠着对朝鲜的侵略及利用这一侵略作为借口所实行的经济动员措施，美帝国主义暂时避开了这个危险。国防部的大批军事拨款，已经大大刺激了新工厂投资及重工业的生产。据商业周刊所载，十一月份军备和其他装备的实际用费，比一九四九年同月约增百分之三十。据纽约时报说，过去六个月中，无线电与电视装备制造商接到了十二亿美元的军用电气装备定货，明年还可望增加五十亿。各汽车制造商接到大批的飞机引擎、坦克和其他军事装备的定货。
    为了加速军火生产而抑止消费品生产，杜鲁门根据紧急法令着手把各种基本物资转向战争工业，并实施严格的信用限制。在缺乏材料的情况下，消费品的生产受到削减或正计划削减。住宅的建筑十一月份较七月份下降了百分之四十。政府专家预言，一九五一年住宅建筑支出将仅及一九五○年的一半。
    大公司从政府上述这些措施获得了巨大利润。“花旗银行公报”所发表的数字表明，在美国入侵朝鲜以后的三个月期间，美国公司利润较一九四九年第三季超过百分之五十四。五百家公司今年第三季的利润达十五亿六千万美元。其中与战争计划有最密切关系的公司的利润增加得最快。据总统经济顾问委员会的估计，全国公司纳税后的全年利润共达二百二十四亿美元，这是第二次世界大战中最高年份一九四四年的二倍多。
    但是广大人民却不得不遭受牺牲：生活费上涨，税收增加，“赶快”制度加紧，生活水准降低，民主权利更加减少。即使据美国劳工部缩小了的官方数字，十一月中的生活费比六月中增加了百分之三点二。自从朝鲜战争爆发以后，所有商品批发价格上涨了百分之十左右。农产品和食粮的批发价格，自年初以来差不多涨了百分之二十。
    自十月以来，失业的人数又增加了，原因是政府停止对消费品工业的原料供应以及某些工厂之改装作军事生产。劳工部报告说，新的申请失业救济的人数，在十一月份平均每星期有十八万六千人，这个数目在十月份是十五万五千，九月份是十三万一千。纽约时报说：“重要官员承认，来年第一季失业会很普遍，而且无论怎样计划，在春季以前似乎都不会使失业减少。”美国商会刊物“我国企业”估计，由于限制住宅建筑，“五分之一的建筑工人必须另找职业”。
    美国农民的境况一年来也更为恶化了。据农业部估计，今年头十一个月的农业收入总额，较去年同一时期低百分之一。这里还没有计算到生活费及农具等等价格的上涨。
    随着向战争的推进，美国统治阶级中法西斯倾向也迅速加剧。塔夫脱——哈特莱法案列入了法典，更加上了一个甚至更为凶恶的麦卡伦法案。在一九五○年这一年中，共产党的总书记、好莱坞十名进步作家，“反法西斯流亡者联合委员会”的领袖们以及其他许多进步人士被下狱；进步教师被解聘；许多城市订立了要共产党人进行登记的地方法；对黑人及其他少数民族的恐怖更加增加了。
    十二月十日纽约时报刊载了该报驻华盛顿记者洛夫特斯标题为“一九五一年的美国：我们的生活会成为什么样子？”的专论。洛夫特斯描绘美国的前景是：军队的增加；全国生产的百分之二十左右拨作战争用途；更高的生活费；缺乏某些衣着；某些家庭用品绝迹；其他货物的品质降低；住宅建筑急剧削减，客用汽车的制造减少；“许多脱节和许多不方便”以及生活水准的普遍下降。
    这种前景，尤其是战争歇斯底里与法西斯趋势的增长，怪不得美国人是“怀着不安的忧虑而不是怀着希望”看新年。
