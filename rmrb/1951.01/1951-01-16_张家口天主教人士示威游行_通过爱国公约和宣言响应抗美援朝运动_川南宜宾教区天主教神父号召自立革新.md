Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 15th: Three hundred and fourteen Catholics in Zhangjiakou City held a demonstration and march on the 14th to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country. (The news about this event on the third page of this newspaper on the 12th mistakenly stated that it was held before the 12th.)

　　Father Li Dexin, the president of Xuanren Hospital, who hosted the conference, delivered a speech. He said: Now the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country is in full swing across the country, and we Catholics should not lag behind. Today's conference is to express the patriotic will of the Catholics in Zhangjiakou City. We want to stand with the people of the whole country and fight to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country! At the meeting, Lu Fu, Deputy Chairman of the Chahar Provincial People's Government, was invited to speak. He warmly welcomed and supported the patriotic actions of the Catholics. Yin Honglie, a representative of the church members, also gave a speech. He emphasized that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of all Catholics in the country. He called on all church members to enthusiastically participate in various practical work to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country.

　　The conference passed five patriotic pledges for Catholics: 1. Unite all church members and actively respond to the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country. 2. Raise awareness, recognize enemies and friends, and never be deceived or utilized by American imperialism. 3. Give play to the patriotic spirit of Catholicism to fulfill the responsibilities that church members should fulfill. 4. Church members in every work post should guarantee to strengthen their work, increase efficiency, and strive to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country. 5. Based on the teachings of loving mankind and peace, resolutely oppose the aggressive war of American imperialism and strive for lasting peace for the motherland and the world. The conference also passed a declaration to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country.

　　After the meeting, a demonstration march was led by Father Li Dexin. The march was led by the national flag, and the participating Catholics carried huge portraits of Chairman Mao, General Kim Il-sung, and the patriotic pledges written in large characters. They shouted slogans along the way such as "Oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea!" and "Thoroughly eliminate the erroneous thoughts of worshipping and being close to the United States." The march was warmly welcomed by the people of the city.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Luzhou, 15th: Wang Juguang, Chen Shizhong and other twenty-one Catholic priests from the Yibin Diocese of Southern Sichuan (which governs the entire Catholic Church in Southern Sichuan) jointly issued a declaration of self-reliance and renovation on the 13th of this month, calling on more than 20,000 church members in the jurisdiction to take action, resolutely sever relations with imperialism, and implement the Three-Self policy of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation.

　　The declaration first stated: Since Catholicism was introduced to China, imperialism has used evangelism as a cover to carry out various aggressive activities. Throughout history, foreign missionaries who came to China almost all had political purposes. Imperialism used the church to spread various ideological toxins in our society, attempting to make us lose our national self-confidence and self-esteem. Recently, people like Austin have even brazenly described these aggressive methods of American imperialism as the "benevolence" and "friendship" of the United States to the Chinese people. This kind of slander and lies can absolutely not deceive the awakened Chinese people, but will only further arouse the hatred and anger of the Chinese people.

　　The declaration pointed out: Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, it has achieved great achievements in various undertakings, completely shattering the rumors and slanders of imperialism. We Catholics love our great motherland. We Catholics completely believe in the true teachings of God on the basis of the interests of the People's Republic of China. We firmly support the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, unite with people from all over the country, and strive to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified and prosperous New China. The declaration finally stated: We call on more than 20,000 church members in the entire diocese to vow to cut off all relations with imperialism and achieve the Three-Self policy of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation as indicated by Vice Premier Guo Moruo in his report at the 65th State Council meeting on December 29th last year, eradicate the political influence left in China by imperialism, especially American imperialism, ideologically, and thoroughly wash away the dirt and filth that imperialism has contaminated the church for more than a hundred years.

　　The declaration was jointly issued by: Priests Wang Juguang, Chen Shizhong, Yang Chongyuan, Qi Xiangyu, Ren Qiuming, Chen Xueshu, Wu Youmin, Yang Wenjie, Wan Lizhong, Tang Zhengxun. Church members Wen Zaiyang, Lv Jiamo, Ding Hao, Jia Chunyuan, Yang Ruji, Zhao Ruyuan, Chen Muyu, Zeng Qingrong, Zhang Nieyun, Zhong Zimei, Ren Jingxiu and other twenty-one people.

　　张家口天主教人士示威游行
    通过爱国公约和宣言响应抗美援朝运动
    川南宜宾教区天主教神父号召自立革新
    【新华社张家口十五日电】张家口市天主教人士三百十四人，于十四日举行抗美援朝保家卫国示威游行大会。（本报十二日第三版所载此项消息误为十二日以前举行）
    大会主持人宣仁医院院长李德馨神父在会上发表了演说。他说：现在全国各地都轰轰烈烈地展开了抗美援朝保家卫国运动，我们天主教友不应当落后于人。今天举行这个大会，就是表示我们张家口市天主教友的爱国意志。我们要和全国人民站在一起，为抗美援朝保家卫国而斗争！会上，察哈尔省人民政府吕复副主席应邀讲话。他热烈表示欢迎和赞助天主教人士的爱国行动。教友代表尹鸿烈亦发表讲话，他着重指出：美帝国主义是全国天主教友的死敌。他号召全体教友热烈地参加抗美援朝保家卫国的各种实际工作。
    会议通过了天主教人士的五项爱国公约：一、团结全体教友，积极响应抗美援朝保家卫国运动。二、提高觉悟，认清敌友，绝不受美帝国主义的欺骗和利用。三、发挥天主教爱国精神，以完成教友应尽的责任。四、在每个工作岗位上的教友，保证加强工作，增进效率，为抗美援朝保家卫国而努力。五、本爱人类和平的教义，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略战争，争取祖国与世界持久和平。会议并通过了抗美援朝保家卫国的宣言。
    会后，由李德馨神父领队举行示威游行。游行队伍以国旗为前导，参加游行的天主教人士抬着毛主席、金日成将军等巨幅画像和大字写的爱国公约前进。他们沿途高呼：“反对美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜！”“彻底肃清崇美亲美的错误思想”等口号。游行队伍受到全市人民的热烈欢迎。
    【新华社泸州十五日电】川南天主教宜宾教区（辖全川南天主教会）天主教神父王炬光、陈适中等二十一人于本月十三日联名发表自立革新宣言，号召辖区内两万多教友行动起来，坚决与帝国主义断绝关系，实行自治、自养、自传的三自政策。
    宣言首称：自天主教传到中国后，帝国主义就用传教作为掩护，进行种种侵略活动。历来的外国传教士到中国来，几乎都怀有政治上的目的。帝国主义利用教会在我国社会上散播种种思想毒素，妄图使我们丧失民族自信心和自尊心。最近，如奥斯汀之流，竟还厚颜无耻地把美帝国主义的这些侵略手段说成是美国对中国人民的“恩惠”和“友谊”。这种诬蔑和谰言，绝对欺骗不了已经觉醒了的中国人民，只有更加激起中国人民的仇恨与愤怒。
    宣言指出：中央人民政府成立以来，在各种事业上取得了伟大的成就，完全粉碎了帝国主义的造谣和诬蔑。我们天主教徒是热爱自己的伟大祖国的。我们天主教徒完全站在中华人民共和国的利益基础上信仰天主真教，我们坚决拥护中国人民政协共同纲领，与全国人士团结一起，为建立一个独立民主、和平统一和富强的新中国而奋斗。宣言最后称：我们号召全教区二万余教友誓与帝国主义割断一切关系，做到郭沫若副总理在去年十二月二十九日第六十五次的政务会议报告中所指示的自治、自养、自传的三自政策，从思想上铲除帝国主义首先是美帝国主义在中国所遗留下来的政治影响，把百余年来帝国主义所沾染于教会的肮脏龌龊予以洗刷净尽。
    联名发表宣言的有：神父王炬光、陈适中、杨重远、齐相渔、任秋鸣、陈学枢、吴佑民、杨文杰、万力众、唐正勋。教徒文再杨、吕嘉谟、丁浩、贾春源、杨汝骥、赵儒渊、陈慕愚、曾庆荣、张蹑云、钟子美、任静修等二十一人。
