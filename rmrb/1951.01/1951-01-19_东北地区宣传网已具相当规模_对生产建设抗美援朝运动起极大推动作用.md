Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. Under the leadership of the CCP committees at all levels, the Northeast region has established a propaganda network of considerable scale. Propaganda and mobilization work has played a significant role in industrial and agricultural production and in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

The establishment of propaganda organizations in various places began in May of last year with propaganda and mobilization work in industrial and mining enterprises, and it experienced enormous development during the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. By the end of December of last year, the region had developed 117,283 propagandists. In some areas with a relatively good foundation, the distribution of propagandists was quite widespread. Some areas have also established relatively solid and regular propaganda organizations. In most factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, there are an average of four to five propagandists for every hundred employees. Three-quarters of the villages in Heilongjiang Province have developed propagandists. Most of the propagandists in various places are Communist Party members, New Democratic Youth League members, and activists among the masses. In the propaganda network of railway departments in Northeast China, 70 percent are Communist Party members and 22 percent are Youth League members.

After the establishment of propaganda organizations in various places, it powerfully promoted the progress of various tasks. In particular, the current affairs propaganda movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend the country aroused high patriotic enthusiasm among the broad masses of people in Northeast China. Tens of thousands of workers, peasants, and educated youths rushed to Korea to volunteer for transportation, rescue, medical care, and logistics work, and launched a large-scale movement to express sympathy and support to the Korean front. In production and construction, it powerfully encouraged the labor enthusiasm of workers and peasants. For example, the production team of the Cui Huimin Propaganda Group in the Liutang Coal Mine of Benxi exceeded the production task for three consecutive months in the last three months of last year due to the development of propaganda and mobilization work, winning three bonuses for overfulfillment. The Xu Chenglin Propaganda Group in Taipingshan Village, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, seized the central task to carry out propaganda during spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest, so that the village's production volume last year increased by more than one-third compared with 1949. Because the leading organs in various places attached importance to propaganda education and persuasive explanation work, and overcame the commandist work style and the purely task-oriented viewpoint existing in some cadres, the work in various places was successfully completed.

Experience in various places proves that, first of all, in the process of establishing, developing, and consolidating the propaganda network, the CCP committees at all levels must strengthen their organizational leadership over the propagandists. The establishment and development of the propaganda network must be carried out with leadership and step-by-step selection of propagandists from the beginning. The conditions for propagandists should be clearly stipulated, and they should be approved by the Party's organizational review. Chengqu, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, proposed a list of over 200 people who actively carried out propaganda after participating in the peace signature campaign by summarizing work and evaluating results, and the CCP Committee approved them as propagandists. These propagandists can all better complete their tasks. Secondly, regularly training propagandists and regularly supplying propaganda materials are also important links in developing and consolidating the propaganda network. The "Propagandist's Handbook" published by the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee has published eleven issues, with a total circulation of 446,500 copies. The Propaganda Departments of the Heilongjiang and Jilin Provincial Committees of the CCP have printed and distributed a lot of propaganda materials for propagandists in various places to use. Qiqihar City in Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province have both held propagandist training classes, training a large number of rural propagandists, who have played a significant role in local propaganda work. Finally, to consolidate the organization of propagandists and make propaganda work regular, it is necessary to establish various meeting, division of labor, and learning systems that are combined with production and work tasks. The propaganda organization in Nangang Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, established a learning system, regularly holding meetings to study how to propose new propaganda content based on the ideological situation of the masses, dividing up the propaganda work through various organizations, and reporting to the CCP District Committee twice a month and requesting propaganda guidelines. The Cui Huimin Propaganda Group in the Liutang Coal Mine of Benxi also stipulated meeting, reporting, and learning systems to ensure and require that propaganda work be carried out regularly in labor production. The propaganda work in these areas has a very good foundation.

Although the propaganda network in Northeast China has achieved great development and achievements, there are still shortcomings such as the uneven development of regions and the impure composition of propagandists. The First Conference of Propaganda Representatives in the Northeast Region has decided to carry out rectification to further develop, consolidate, and improve the propaganda network in the region.

　　东北地区宣传网已具相当规模
    对生产建设抗美援朝运动起极大推动作用
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】东北全区在中共各级党委的领导下，已建立了具有相当规模的宣传网。宣传鼓动工作在工农业生产中和抗美援朝运动中起了很大的作用。
    各地建立宣传组织是从去年五月各工矿企业中的宣传鼓动工作开始的，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中得到巨大发展。至去年十二月底止，全区已发展的宣传员达十一万七千二百八十三人。部分基础较好的地区，宣传员的分布已相当广泛。有些地区并已建立了较为巩固的经常性的宣传员组织。鞍山钢铁公司的大部分厂矿，平均每百名职工中有四至五名宣传员。黑龙江全省四分之三的村子都发展了宣传员。各地的宣传员大多是共产党员、新民主主义青年团员和群众中的积极分子。东北各地铁路部门的宣传网中，有百分之七十的共产党员和百分之二十二的青年团员。
    各地建立宣传员组织后，有力地推动了各种工作的进展。尤其是抗美援朝保家卫国的时事宣传运动，在东北激起了广大人民高涨的爱国热情。成千成万的工人、农民和知识青年奔赴朝鲜，志愿参加运输、救护、医疗和后勤等工作，并展开了大规模的慰问和支援朝鲜前线的运动。在生产建设中有力地鼓舞了工人和农民的劳动热情。例如本溪柳塘煤矿崔惠民宣传小组所在的生产班，由于宣传鼓动工作的开展，去年最后的三个月，连续超过生产任务。获得三次超额奖金。黑龙江省肇东县太平山村许成林宣传小组，在春耕、夏锄、秋收等工作中，都抓紧中心工作进行宣传，使该村去年的生产量较一九四九年提高了三分之一以上。由于各地领导机关重视宣传教育和说服解释工作，并克服了某些干部存在着的强迫命令作风和单纯任务观点，因而使各地工作得以顺利完成。
    各地经验证明，首先在建立、发展和巩固宣传网的过程中，各级中共党委必须加强对宣传员的组织领导。宣传网的建立与发展，一开始就必须有领导有步骤地进行对宣传员的选择，宣传员应明确规定条件，并经过党的组织审查批准。黑龙江省海伦县城区，从参加和平签名运动积极进行宣传的二百余人中，通过总结工作、评判成绩的方法，提出名单，经过中共党委的组织批准为宣传员。这种宣传员都能较好地完成任务。其次定期培养和训练宣传员以及经常供给宣传材料，也是发展和巩固宣传网的重要环节。中共中央东北局宣传部出版的《宣传员手册》已出版十一期，共发行四十四万六千五百份。中共黑龙江和吉林省委宣传部印发了不少宣传材料，供给各地宣传员采用。黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市和吉林省都举办了宣传员训练班，训练了大批农村宣传员，他们都在当地宣传工作中起了很大的作用。最后要巩固宣传员的组织并使宣传工作经常化，必须建立与生产、工作任务相结合的各种会议、分工和学习制度。吉林省蛟河县南岗村的宣传组织确立了学习制度，定期集会研究如根据群众思想情况，提出新的宣传内容，通过各种不同组织，分工进行宣传工作，并每月向中共区委作两次汇报并请示宣传方针。本溪柳塘煤矿崔惠民宣传小组也规定了会议、汇报和学习等制度，保证并要求在劳动生产中经常地进行宣传工作。这种地区的宣传工作，都有了很好的基础。
    东北各地宣传网虽然得到很大的发展和成绩，但还存在着发展地区不够平衡，宣传员成份不够纯洁等缺点。东北区第一届宣传员代表会议已决定进行整顿，使全区的宣传网获得进一步的发展、巩固与提高。
