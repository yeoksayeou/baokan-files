　　The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Must Not Be Slandered
　　Zhaduorozhinei

　　Due to the shameful defeat suffered by MacArthur's army in Korea, the Anglo-American aggressors have resorted to a new trick, raising the issue of the so-called "Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China interfering in Korea" for discussion in the United Nations General Assembly. The Washington adventurers are again trying to confuse world public opinion, portraying the People's Republic of China as an aggressor and interventionist, attempting to cover up the real aggressor—the United States.

　　Representatives of the Anglo-American bloc are煽动ly saying: "The troops of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China are conducting military operations against the United Nations forces in Korea." However, they cannot provide any concrete facts or any evidence sufficient to support the accusation. These facts cannot be found, for the simple reason that they do not exist. The Anglo-American slanderers are standing on the path of fabricating and distorting the basic concepts of international law, attempting to portray the Chinese volunteer soldiers fighting alongside the army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as regular Chinese troops. They are using this clumsy slander to try to prove that the actions of these volunteer soldiers are the actions of the Chinese government's army, and at the same time prove that China has taken armed intervention in Korea.

　　In fact, it is completely indisputable in the theory and practice of international law that the participation of volunteer soldiers from any country in the military operations of a belligerent country does not violate international law and the neutrality of that country, and that the country is not responsible for the actions of the volunteer soldiers composed of its citizens.

　　For example, Article 5 of Chapter 4 of the Hague Convention of 1907, "Concerning the Rights and Duties of States and Persons in War on Land," signed by most countries in the world—including the United States, Britain, and France—states: "A neutral Power is not called upon to prevent persons from crossing the frontier separately to offer their services to one of the belligerents."

　　The above-mentioned provisions of international law are recognized by many experts, first and foremost by international jurists from the United States, Britain, and France. The official representatives of these countries are now shamelessly displaying their ignorance on issues of international law.

　　British jurists Oppenheim and Lauterpacht, in their international law textbook (which is popular in Anglo-Saxon countries), wrote on this issue: "Belligerents may enlist people of other nationalities (whether these countries are allies or neutral countries) into their armed forces, as combatants or non-combatants. There have been very few wars that have not involved this situation. Therefore, the fact that a person of foreign nationality becomes a member of the armed forces does not constitute any crime in violation of international law." They emphasized that "a neutral country should not prohibit its citizens from serving in the military for a belligerent country," and that "a neutral country citizen who has joined the military service of a belligerent country does not violate any provisions of international law."

　　American jurists Robert Wilson and Charles Hyde also advocate similar views. For example, Wilson said: "It is now clear that a country that is a belligerent can legally permit citizens of neighboring allied or neutral countries to join its armed forces."

　　Hyde wrote in his three-volume "International Law Textbook," "International law does not prohibit belligerents from enlisting foreign citizens into their armed forces..." Therefore, Hyde cites this fact as an example: "In the initial stage of World War I, when the United States was still a neutral country, many American citizens joined the military service of some belligerent countries." The most obvious example is the special treaty concluded between the United States and Britain on June 3, 1918, regarding the service of Americans in the British army.

　　The views of Oppenheim and Lauterpacht mentioned above were acknowledged and elaborated in an article published in the 1942 "American Journal of International Law" co-authored by Hyde and Urian Fische, a prominent official of the U.S. Navy Department and a professor at Columbia University. That article states: "The service of volunteer soldiers does not fundamentally prejudice the issue of international regulations... Recruiting volunteer soldiers from foreign citizens is a special issue of internal affairs." Those American interventionists who are shamelessly slandering China and Korea in the United Nations General Assembly should not forget the principles upheld by the American doctrine of international law!

　　Many facts of volunteer soldiers participating in the military operations of belligerent countries can be drawn from history, but no country of nationality of volunteer soldiers has ever been considered an interventionist. This is a fact that is simultaneously relevant to Britain, the United States, and France—the slanderous countries of today. As is well known, at the end of the eighteenth century, many French volunteer soldiers participated in the American War of Independence against Britain. French social luminaries Lafayette and Saint-Simon, as well as other French generals and officers, led a large number of French volunteer soldiers in the fighting. The writer Beaumarchais and many other French citizens organized military supplies for the American army and equipped the French volunteer soldiers.

　　As is well known, many Swiss volunteer soldiers participated on the French side during the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. Citizens of various nationalities once participated on the side of Garibaldi of Italy (Note 1), on the side of the Boer Republic against Britain (Note 2), on the side of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, and on the side of the Balkan people against Turkey in the First Balkan War in 1911. Spanish citizens and Italian citizens once participated on the French side in the 1914-1918 war, and later, volunteer soldiers from many countries participated on the side of the Spanish Republican army.

　　The Marshallized French government, echoing the Anglo-American slanderers, has completely lost its sense of shame. For many years, the French government has maintained an army composed of foreigners who regularly participate in wars. During World War I, the French government even promulgated two decrees on August 3, 1914, and October 22, 1918, preparing to organize foreign volunteer soldiers.

　　Now the Anglo-American imperialists are trying to justify their defeat in Korea with a claim that Chinese troops "growing in Korea" are opposing them. The accusation against the government of the People's Republic of China, therefore, is similarly a crude slander, a slander without any factual and legal basis. MacArthur, who fabricated this false document, should know the treaties concluded by his government. For example, Article 23 of the Havana Convention on Maritime Neutrality, signed by the United States in 1928, stipulates that "A neutral State is not bound to prevent the voluntary departure of its citizens, even if they depart in groups, to enlist in the service of a belligerent Power."

　　It is not surprising that MacArthur's slander has been shamefully shattered. Without a doubt, the same fate awaits the current slander of the war-mongers against the people of China and Korea.

　　中国人民志愿军是不容诽谤的
    扎朵罗日内依
    由于麦克阿瑟的军队在朝鲜所遭受的耻辱的败北，英美侵略分子们玩弄了一套新把戏，把所谓“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”的问题提到联合国大会上来讨论。华盛顿的冒险家们又尽力淆惑世界舆论，把中华人民共和国描写成侵略者和干涉者，企图借此掩盖真正的侵略者——美国。
    英美集团的代表者们煽动地说道：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府的军队正在进行反对在朝鲜的联合国军队的军事行动。”但是他们说不出任何具体事实，也拿不出任何足以提出控诉的证据。这些事实是找不出的，最简单的理由就是根本没有。英美的诽谤者们站在捏造和歪曲国际公法的基本概念的道路上，企图把与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军队并肩作战的中国志愿军说成中国正规军。他们用这种笨拙的诬蔑手段，力图证明这些志愿军的行动就是中国政府军队的行动，同时证明中国是在朝鲜采取了武装干涉。
    实际上，关于任何一国的志愿军参加交战国一方的军事行动并不破坏国际公法和该国中立，而且该国对于它的公民所组成的志愿军的行动不负任何责任这一点，在国际公法的学理和惯例上，都认为是完全无可争辩的。
    例如，一九○七年，世界上大多数国家——其中包括美国、英国和法国——所签订的海牙条约第四章第五条“关于陆战时国家和个人的权利与义务”中说：“中立国的个人越过境界服务于交战国一方时，该中立国是不负责任的”。
    上述的国际公法的条例是许多专家，首先是美国、英国和法国的国际法学家所承认的。这些国家的官方代表们，现在却无耻地表现了自己在国际公法问题上的无知。
    英国法学家奥本海和赖乌契派德在自己的国际公法教程（这是流行于盎格罗·撒克逊国家的）中论及这个问题时写道：“交战国可以征募其他国籍的人（不论这些国家是同盟国或中立国）加入自己的武装力量，作为战斗员，或非战斗员。历来所发生的战争是很少没有这种情况的。因此，有外国国籍的人成为武装战斗力量的一员，这并不能构成违反国际公法规定的任何罪行”。他们强调说，“中立国不应当禁止自己的公民为交战国服军役”，同时“凡已参加交战国军役的中立国公民，并不破坏国际公法的任何规定”。
    美国的法学家罗伯特·威尔逊和查理士·海特也主张着类似这样的见解。例如威尔逊说：“现在这一点是明确了：作为交战国一方的国家能够合法地许可邻近的同盟国或中立国的公民加入自己的武装力量”。
    海特在其三大册的“国际公法教程”中写道，“国际公法还没有禁止交战国征集外国公民加入自己武装力量的规定……”因此海特引出这个事实作例：“在第一次世界大战最初阶段，美国还是中立国，许多美国的公民参加了某些交战国一方的军役”。最明显的就是一九一八年六月三日，美国与英国缔结了关于美国人在英军中服役的特殊条约。
    上面所说到的奥本海和赖乌契派德的见解，在海特和乌里扬·费希（美国海军部著名官员和哥伦比亚大学教授）所合写的刊登于一九四二年“美国国际公法杂志”的一篇论文中，获得了承认和阐发。那篇论文中写道：“志愿军的服务，在基本上并没有妨害国际条例的问题……从外国公民中征集志愿兵是关于内政的特殊问题”。在联合国大会上无耻地诽谤着中国和朝鲜的那些美国干涉者们，不应该忘记为美国的国际公法学说所维护的原则！
    从历史中可以引出许多志愿军参加交战国一方的事实，但是不论何时何地，都没有把志愿军所属国籍的国家认为干涉者。这是同时有关英国，美国和法国——今日的诽谤者国家——的事实之一。如所周知，十八世纪末，许多法国志愿军参加了美国反对英国的独立战争。法国社会名流拉斐德和圣西门及其他法国的将军和军官们领导着庞大的法国志愿军参加了战斗。作家薄麦希和其他许多法国公民为美军组织了军事的给养，并装备了法国志愿军。
    如所周知，有许多瑞士志愿军曾于一八七一年普法战争期间，参加到法国方面。各种不同国籍的公民曾经参加到意大利的加里波的（注一）方面，参加到反对英国的波尔共和国方面（注二），参加到一八九七年希土战争的希腊方面，参加到一九一一年第一次巴尔干战争中反对土耳其的巴尔干人民方面。西班牙公民和意大利公民则在一九一四年——一九一八年战争中曾经参加到法国方面，后来，许多国家的志愿军又曾经参加到西班牙共和国军队方面。
    附和着英、美诽谤者的马歇尔化法国政府，完全丧失了羞耻心。很多年来，法国政府维持着经常参加战争的由外国人组成的军队。在第一次世界大战期间，法国政府甚至还于一九一四年八月三日和一九一八年十月二十二日颁布了两个准备组织外国志愿军的法令。
    现在英美帝国主义者们试图用一种好像“在朝鲜生长的”中国军队反对他们的说法给自己在朝鲜的败北辩解一番。由此提出的对中华人民共和国政府的控诉，同样是粗暴的诽谤，是没有任何的事实和法律根据的诽谤。制造了这个伪文件的麦克阿瑟，应当知道他的政府所缔结的那些条约。例如，一九二八年美国签署的关于海上中立的哈瓦那公约二十三条规定说：“中立国家对于本国公民自愿地，即使成群结伙地参加交战国这件事，不应加以阻止。”
    麦克阿瑟的诽谤是可耻地破灭了，这是不足为奇的。毫无疑问，同样的命运等待着现在战争贩子对中国和朝鲜人民的诽谤。
