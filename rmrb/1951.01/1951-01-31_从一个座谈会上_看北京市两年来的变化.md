Editor's Note: The Beijing Fourth Cultural Center held a symposium in mid-January, including citizens, industrialists and merchants, shop assistants, former soldiers, and night school teachers, to discuss the changes in Beijing in the two years since liberation. From everyone's speeches, we can see the new life and progress of our country under the New Democratic social system. The following are excerpts from the symposium speeches.

　　Xing Xinqi (Shop Assistant): Big store managers used to look down on the working people, but now they are somewhat different. In the past, managers didn't care about current affairs; they would say, "Whoever comes, pay taxes to them." Now, they all realize that only when the country is well-built and well-defended can they do business properly, so they are all very concerned about current affairs. The campaign this winter to mobilize citizens to sweep snow also shows that the general public and shop assistants have indeed made progress, overcoming the old habit of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep."

　　Police officers are closest to the people. In the old society, the police served the ruling class and oppressed the people, so the general public had a bad impression of them. When we were first liberated, we didn't dare to express our opinions about them for fear of retaliation. Now, the convening of the Municipal and District People's Representative Conferences has given the people a guarantee; at the same time, the Communist Party's advocacy of criticism and self-criticism has educated and enlightened the people to boldly and frankly express their opinions.

　　It wasn't like that in the old society. Once Chiang Kai-shek came to Beijing and set up many suggestion boxes. When people made suggestions, they were beaten up after being found out.

　　Zu Dexin (Citizen): There have been many changes in Beijing in the past two years. To be divided into two aspects:

　　First, the transformation of social life: In just two years, the People's Government has undertaken unprecedented municipal construction projects such as clearing garbage, repairing rivers, repairing sewers, repairing roads, and repairing Beihai Park. On the market, thieves and beggars have been greatly reduced; and there are fewer fights. The market is now safe, and there are fewer bad people.

　　Second, the transformation of thought: Because the learning movement has been carried out since liberation, the people have received a lot of education and enlightenment. Many workers' night schools, adult night schools, and worker-peasant middle schools have been established. Due to the development of these studies, the people have improved culturally and politically. For example, the peace signature campaign was very enthusiastic. In the past, restaurants and teahouses were posted with "Do not discuss state affairs"; however, now the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and to donate winter clothes, have been enthusiastically and widely carried out, and successfully completed. Especially the young people enthusiastically signed up to participate in military cadre schools, and even the elderly are willing to encourage their children to go. This is a manifestation of the patriotism of our broad masses of people, which is unprecedented in Chinese history.

　　Sun Jingwu (Former Puppet Army Officer): After being educated by various practical life experiences after liberation, most of the masses have gradually gained an understanding of the new China. For example, a person in our courtyard who trades in delicacies from land and sea hoarded a lot of things when the Korean War first started: rice, flour, daily necessities, etc., and encouraged his neighbors to hoard them as well, saying: "The United States may cross the Yalu River to enter the Northeast and North China and encircle Beijing; hoard some things now, so that you won't be able to buy things when the time comes." I explained to him that the government must have a way, and prices will never fluctuate, but he didn't believe it at the time. Now, the US military has been defeated in Korea, and prices are stable, but the food he stored has gone bad. Due to the education of facts, he began to have some understanding of the People's Government.

　　He Yaowei (Citizen, Night School Teacher): There were many thieves in Beijing in the past. After liberation, labor reform made them realize the value of labor and self-reliance. I think Beijing's public security work is very good.

　　In the past, there were many brothels, but now they have become production cooperatives, factories, or shops. At the same time, many women who suffered in the old society have also been transformed, and they have escaped from inhuman lives. This is a great education for the people.

　　Furthermore, prices have also stabilized. Last year, prices fluctuated once, and people generally said: "The Communist Party started with millet and cannot handle these gold US dollars." But the fact proves that the government not only stabilized prices, but also suppressed the grain tigers who have always colluded with the ruling class to exploit the people. This is a great job. Trade companies and retail stores have played a vital role in ensuring the supply of people's daily necessities. There was a period when some businessmen felt it was difficult to do business, but after adjusting industry and commerce, it got better.

　　In the past, the police oppressed the people, but now when it rains, the police and cadres brave the rain to take care of the people and prevent houses from collapsing, helping to repair and find houses to prevent houses from being dangerous. I hope that the government can have better ways to solve the housing problem this year.

　　Long Jinxiu (Merchant): Although a few merchants are still unwilling to pay taxes and dislike paying too much, they do not deny that the municipal construction is good and that the taxes are not paid in vain. When the Central People's Government was established the year before last, Premier Zhou delivered Chairman Mao's announcement to various countries. One merchant thought it was a waste and didn't read the report much. But last year when the United States invaded Korea, he saw that the United States had bad intentions. Later, the volunteers went to Korea and put forward the slogan "Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country", which he thought was very right. When financial and economic unification was implemented, he believed that no one but the Communist Party could do such a thing. Now he knows that the Communist Party can govern the country and truly serve the people.

　　Su Yifan (Citizen): Now the people and the government are really standing on the same front. As soon as the government calls, the masses immediately respond. This kind of government-people integration has never happened before. In the past, Beijing was a feudal fortress in the country, and many citizens carried cages and birds and idled around. But now most people are willing to have a job and do something, which has changed the bad habits of the past. Now newspapers and magazines are talking about serious matters. In the past, they mostly served the ruling class and were pastimes for the leisure class. Now, not only are young people patriotic and enthusiastically signing up to participate in military cadre schools, but also the elderly believe in the country and encourage their children's patriotic actions, which are completely different from the past.

### 从一个座谈会上  看北京市两年来的变化

　　从一个座谈会上
    看北京市两年来的变化
    编者按：京市第四文化馆于一月中旬开了一个包括市民、工商业者、店员、旧军人、夜校教员的座谈会，座谈北京解放两年来的变化。从大家的发言中，可以看到我们的国家在新民主主义社会制度下新生和进步的情形。以下为座谈会中的发言摘要。
    邢新起（店员）：商店大经理过去对劳动人民看不起，现在却有些不同了。以往，经理对时事不关心，他们都会说：“谁来了给谁纳税。”现在，他们都认识到只有国家建设好，保卫好，才能好好地做生意，所以也都很关心时事。从今冬发动市民扫雪这件事来看，也表明了一般市民、店员确是进步了，克服了“各人自扫门前雪”的旧习。
    警察是和人民最接近的。在旧社会，警察为统治阶级服务，压迫人民，所以一般人对他们印象不好。刚解放时，对他们有意见也不敢提出，怕报复。现在，由于市、区各界人民代表会议的召开，给了人民一个保障；同时由于共产党提倡批评与自我批评，教育、启发人民大胆、坦白的提出意见。
    在旧社会就不然了，有一次蒋介石来京，设了许多意见箱，人民提了意见，被查知后，反而挨了一顿打。
    祖德馨（市民）：北京市二年来的变化很多。分两方面来说：
    第一、社会生活的转变：人民政府在短短的两年中，做了清除垃圾，修河，修下水道，修路，修北海等市政建设，在历史上这是空前的。市面上，小偷、乞丐大为减少了；打架的也都少了。现在市面安全，坏人少。
    第二、思想上的转变：因为解放后开展了学习运动，给了人民很多教育与启发。工人夜校、成人夜校、工农中学等成立很多。由于这些学习的开展，人民在文化和政治上提高了，如和平签名运动，表现得很热烈。以往饭馆，茶馆都贴着“莫谈国事”；然而现在抗美援朝，和捐募寒衣等运动，都热烈的广泛展开，顺利的完成。尤其是青年踊跃报名参加军事干部学校，连老人也愿意鼓励他们的子女去，这是我广大人民爱国主义的表现，是中国有史以来所未有的。
    孙经武（曾任伪军官）：大多数群众在解放后经过各种实际生活的教育，对新中国都逐渐有了认识。如本院有一个作山珍海味生意的人，在朝鲜战争初起时，他便囤积了很多东西：米、面、日用品等，同时鼓动邻居也来囤积，并说：“美国可能要打过鸭绿江进东北、华北，包围北京；现在囤积些东西，以免到时买不到东西。”我就给他解释政府一定有办法，物价绝不会波动，他当时还不相信。现在，美军在朝鲜吃到败仗，物价稳定，然而他存的食粮已经坏了。由于事实的教育，使他对人民的政府开始有一些认识。
    贺耀威（市民，夜校教员）：北京市过去小偷多。解放了，由于劳动改造，使他们知道了劳动的可贵，自力更生。我认为北京治安工作作得很好。
    过去有很多妓院，现在都成了生产社、工厂、或商店。同时许多在旧社会下受害的妇女也改造了，她们脱离了非人的生活。这对人民是一个很大的教育。
    再有，物价也已平稳了。在去年物价曾一度波动，一般人说：“共产党是小米成家，搞不了这些黄金美钞的。”而事实证明政府不但平稳了物价，镇压了一向和统治阶级勾结剥削人民的粮老虎，这是一件大工作。贸易公司及零售店对供给人民生活必需品，起了绝大的保证作用。有个时期曾有些商人感到做生意困难，调整工商业后便好起来了。
    过去警察是压迫人民的，而现在当下雨天，警察、干部冒着雨水照顾人民，防止房屋倒塌。帮助修理、找房，以免房子发生危险。希望今年政府对房屋问题，能有更好的办法来解决。
    龙进修（商人）：少数商人虽然还不愿意拿税，嫌出的多，但他们不否认市政建设好，税没有白拿。前年中央人民政府成立，周总理将毛主席公告送达各国，有一商人认为是白费，报也不大看。但去年美国侵朝时，他便看到美国不怀好意。后来志愿军赴朝，提出了“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的口号，他认为很对。当财经统一后，他认为这样的事除了共产党谁也办不了。现在他知道了共产党能治理国家，是真正为人民服务的。
    苏毅范（市民）：现在的人民和政府真是站在一条战线上了。政府一号召，群众便马上响应，这样的政府与人民一体的关系是过去从未有过的。以前北京在全国是封建的堡垒，很多市民提笼架鸟，游手好闲。但现在一般人都愿意有个职业，作些事情，改变了以往的坏风气。现在报纸、杂志上都谈的是正经事，过去多是为统治阶级服务，是有闲阶级的消遣品。现在不但青年爱国，踊跃报名参加军事干部学校，就是老年人，也都相信国家，鼓励子女的爱国行动，这都与以前截然不同。（第四文化馆曾伯融整理）
