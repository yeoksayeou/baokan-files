　　Resist America, Aid Korea, Oppose US Imperialism's Arming of Japan!
    Beijing 40,000 Women Demonstrate and March
    The Congress Sends a Respectful Telegram to Chairman Mao and Passes a Patriotic Pact
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Beijing – Over 40,000 women from all walks of life in Beijing held a grand patriotic rally and demonstration march on the 28th to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose US imperialism’s rearmament of Japan, protesting the war-monger Dulles’s sinister conspiracy activities in Japan.
    The rally began at 1:00 PM in the Taihe Hall of the Forbidden City in the capital. First, a presidium of 47 people was announced, including Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, Xu Guangping, Liu Wang Liming, Ding Ling, Li Bozhao, Yang Gang, Zhang Xiaomei, Yang Yunyu, Liu Qingyang, Yang Baojun, Yang Zaoxin, Dong Ruqin, Pu Jiexiu, Yu Xiu'ai, Lao Junzhan, Fu Xuewen, Yu Ruqi, Zhu Guangxia, Tao Shufan, Wang Chunjing, Liu Xikui, Xin'an, and Gao Danniang. As the band played the solemn national anthem – the March of the Volunteers, which twenty years ago called on the Chinese people to resist Japanese imperialism – the entire venue fell silent, a sea of red flags gently undulating, emblazoned with the words "Oppose US Imperialism's Rearmament of Japan." After Liu Qingyang, chair of the congress, delivered the opening remarks, Cai Chang, chair of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke cordially to the assembled sisters amidst thunderous applause. She exposed the US imperialists’ arrogant and despicable plot to rearm Japan, and called on Beijing women and women across the country to further expand the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, strengthen various concrete efforts, and, together with the people of the whole country, the people of Japan, and the people of Asia, fight against the US rearmament of Japan and strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan. The women present listened with great excitement to the speech of Kim Un-joo, wife of the North Korean Ambassador to China, Lee Joo-yeon. She angrily denounced the barbaric acts of US imperialism in invading Korea and the sinister plot of US imperialism to rearm Japan, and firmly believed that the Korean and Chinese people would definitely shatter all US imperialist aggression.
    Representatives of women from all walks of life reported on the enthusiastic participation of women from all strata of Beijing in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and put forward new guarantees. Female worker representative Cao Yali guaranteed that Beijing female workers would definitely respond to the challenge of the Northeast Ma Hengchang Group, expand the patriotic production competition, and strengthen the country's economic strength. Rural women representative Liu Meihua guaranteed to produce more grain to safeguard the good life after land reform. Female student representative Li Chuanxiu excitedly reported that more than 800 female students in Beijing had joined military cadre schools, standing on the forefront of defending the motherland. Women's medical worker representative Yang Baojun said that many women's medical workers in Beijing had bravely joined volunteer medical teams and front-line surgical teams, standing at the forefront of Resist America, Aid Korea. Sister Wang Chunjing shouted out the patriotic voice of female Catholic believers in Beijing, which was warmly welcomed by the audience. She said: Beijing's female Catholic believers will, from now on, express their love for the motherland through practical actions such as striving for production, striving to learn, and promoting the Catholic reform movement. Buddhist representative Master Xin'an and housewife representative Zhang Weiying both guaranteed that Buddhist women and hundreds of thousands of housewives in Beijing would actively participate in the patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose the US rearmament of Japan. Model military dependent Mother Han, who has three sons, two daughters-in-law, and one daughter fighting US imperialism in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and Mother Gao, who collected 8,000 peace signatures, were interrupted several times by cheers and applause during their short speeches.
    The congress unanimously adopted the Beijing Women's Patriotic Pact to consolidate and enhance the achievements of the Beijing women's patriotic movement. The congress passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, a telegram of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, a telegram of respect to the Women's International Democratic Federation, a telegram of respect to the All-China Women's Federation, a telegram warning the reactionary Japanese government, a letter to Japanese sisters, a letter to all Asian women who love peace and democracy, a telegram of sympathy to the Korean Democratic Women's Union, and a telegram protesting the French government's ban on the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth from operating in France.
    The march began at 1:25 PM. Hundreds of red flags, large portraits of people's leaders from various countries, an honor guard composed of literary and artistic forces, and the presidium including Cai Chang, Xu Guangping, Luo Shuzhang, Ding Ling, Li Bozhao, and Liu Qingyang led the march. The solemn procession of 40,000 women from all walks of life in Beijing, including female workers, female students, female artists, rural women from the suburbs, female military personnel, female staff members, female doctors, female nurses, childcare workers, nuns, and Buddhist nuns, passed through the arched gates of the Forbidden City, advancing slowly in two columns, east and west. Many mothers with children and grandmothers with daughters-in-law and granddaughters participated in the march. The mothers and grandmothers enthusiastically shouted "Oppose American Aggression, Defend World Peace!" "Oppose US Imperialism's Rearmament of Japan!" "Educate Children to Love the Motherland!" After three months of Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education, Beijing women, who have recognized the aggressive face of US imperialism, hate the shameless conspiracy of US imperialism to rearm Japan with their own painful experiences. Some women in the march had personally suffered insults and persecution from Japanese invaders. Many housewives could not forget the painful days of being given rations of mixed flour and their whole family being plunged into hunger when the Japanese invaders occupied Beijing. Therefore, they enthusiastically participated in the patriotic demonstration. An 82-year-old woman from the Sixth District and Zhu Hong, a street representative with only one leg, both participated, leaning on crutches. Professor Shen Dong's mother, Mother Shen, who had never participated in a march, also rushed into the city from outside the city.
    The emotions of the marching crowd were consistently full and high. Beijing women were inspecting their own strength and deeply believed in their strength.

    大会于下午一时在首都故宫太和殿举行。首先宣布以蔡畅、邓颖超、许广平、刘王立明、丁玲、李伯钊、杨刚、张晓梅、杨蕴玉、刘清扬、杨葆俊、杨造新、董汝勤、浦洁修、俞秀蔼、劳君展、傅学文、于汝麒、朱光霞、陶淑范、王纯静、刘喜奎、心安、高大娘等四十七人为主席团。当乐队奏起庄严的国歌——二十年前号召中国人民反日帝的义勇军进行曲时，全场肃然无声，一片红旗的波涛徐徐起伏，闪耀着“反对美帝重新武装日本”的字样。大会主席刘清扬致开会词后，全国妇联主席蔡畅在如雷的掌声中向到会的妇女姊妹亲切地讲话。她揭发了美帝正阴谋进行重新武装日本的狂妄、卑鄙的勾当，号召北京妇女和全国妇女，进一步展开抗美援朝运动，加强各种具体工作，与全国人民、日本人民、亚洲人民一起，为反对美国重新武装日本，争取签订全面的公正的对日和约而斗争。到会妇女群众以十分兴奋的心情，倾听到会贵宾朝鲜驻华大使李周渊夫人金云竹的讲话。她愤怒地控诉美帝侵略朝鲜的野蛮行为和美帝重新武装日本的罪恶阴谋，坚决相信朝鲜和中国人民一定能粉碎美帝一切侵略。
    各界妇女代表的讲话，报告了北京市各阶层妇女参加抗美援朝运动的热烈情况，并提出新的保证。女工代表曹亚力保证北京市女工一定响应东北马恒昌小组的挑战，扩大爱国主义生产竞赛，加强祖国经济力量。农村妇女代表刘美华保证多打粮食来保障土改后的好日子。女学生代表李传琇兴奋地报告北京市已有八百多女同学参加军事干校，站在捍卫祖国的最前线。妇女医药工作者代表杨宝钧说，北京市妇女医药工作者已经有不少人勇敢地参加了志愿救护队和前方手术队，站在抗美援朝的最前线。王纯静修女喊出北京市天主教女教徒爱国的声音，受到了全场热烈的欢迎。她说：北京天主教女教徒今后将以努力生产、努力学习、促进天主教革新运动等实际行动来表示自己对于祖国的热爱。佛教代表心安师傅和家庭妇女代表张伟英都保证北京市信仰佛教的妇女和数十万家庭妇女将积极参加抗美援朝、反对美帝重新武装日本的爱国运动。有着三个儿子、两个媳妇、一个女儿在中国人民志愿军打击美帝的模范军属韩大娘，征集了八千和平签名者的高大娘，她们短短的讲话，几次为欢呼声和鼓掌声所打断。
    大会一致通过了北京市妇女界爱国公约，以巩固和提高京市妇女爱国运动的成果。大会通过了向毛主席致敬电，向中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军致敬电，向国际民主妇联致敬电，向全国妇联致敬电，警告日本反动政府电，给日本姊妹的一封信，给全亚洲爱好和平民主妇女的一封信，向朝鲜民主妇女总同盟慰问电，并通过抗议法国政府禁止世界工联、国际民主妇联、世界民主青联在法国活动的电文。
    游行于下午一时二十五分开始。数百面红旗及各国人民领袖的大画像、文艺大军所组成的仪仗队以及蔡畅、许广平、罗叔章、丁玲、李伯钊、刘清扬等主席团为游行行列的先导，北京的女工、女学生、女艺人、郊区农妇，部队妇女工作者、女职员、女医生、女护士、保育工作者、修女、尼姑等各界妇女四万人组成的庄严行列，穿过故宫的穹形大门，分东西两路徐徐前进。游行行列中有许多带着孩子的母亲，也有带着媳妇、孙女的祖母。母亲们和祖母们都为保卫孩子的幸福而热烈喊着：“反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平！”“反对美帝重新武装日本！”“教育子女热爱祖国！”经过三个月来抗美援朝的宣传教育、认清美帝侵略面目的北京妇女，以切身惨痛的经历痛恨美帝重新武装日本的无耻阴谋。游行队伍中有的妇女曾亲身受过日寇的侮辱迫害。许多家庭妇女更忘不了日寇占领北京时配给混合面、全家陷于饥饿的痛苦日子。因而她们这样踊跃地参加了爱国大游行。六区一位八十二岁的老太太和只有一条腿的街代表朱虹，都扶着拐杖来参加，从来没有参加过游行的清华大学教授沈侗的母亲沈老太太也从城外赶进城来。
    游行队伍的情绪始终饱满高昂。北京市妇女检阅着自己的力量，并深信自己的力量。（附图片）右：首都妇女的游行队伍。下：首都妇女在太和殿举行爱国大会。
