　　We Won Rent Reduction, and We Must Also Win in Production
　　—A Letter from Farmers of Wenxing Township, Beibei, Chongqing to Chairman Mao

　　Dear Chairman Mao:

　　Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party for the past year, we have abolished the feudal Baojia system, established the people's regime, and each village has a farmers' association organization. Today, the township farmers' association is established, and all 3,326 male and female farmers in our township are celebrating our great unity and celebrating our victory in rent reduction. Everyone is unspeakably happy. We have reduced a total of 371,996 jin of grain from the landlords, an average of 264 jin more per household than in previous years. We will save and use these fruits of victory in this spring's great production campaign to make production even better. Now, taking advantage of the production slack season, we must study hard to raise our awareness, consolidate and expand our victory, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. We know that the American imperialists and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are unwilling to accept their defeat, but the power of the standing-up Chinese people is as great as the sky. We are determined to unite closely around the Communist Party and advance victoriously.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　The Entire Farmers of Wenxing Township, Beibei, Chongqing

　　我们减租胜利了  还要在生产上胜利
    ——重庆北碚文星乡农民给毛主席的信亲爱的毛主席：
    一年来在人民政府和共产党的领导下，我们废除了封建的保甲制度，建立起人民的政权，各村都有了农民协会的组织。今天乡农民协会成立，我们全乡三千三百二十六个男女农民来庆祝我们的大团结，庆祝我们的减租胜利。每个人心里都有说不出来的高兴。我们向地主共减回多交的租谷三十七万一千九百九十六斤，平均每户人家比往年可以多得二百六十四斤。我们要省吃俭用，把这些胜利果实投入今春的大生产中去，使生产搞得更好。现在趁生产空闲，我们要好好学习，提高觉悟，以巩固和扩大我们的胜利，来支援中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军。我们晓得：美帝国主义和蒋介石残余匪帮对它们的失败是死不甘心的，可是站起来的中国人民力量大如天。我们决心紧密团结在共产党的周围胜利前进。
            重庆市北碚文星乡全体农民
