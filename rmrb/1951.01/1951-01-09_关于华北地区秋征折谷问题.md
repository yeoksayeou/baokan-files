To the Editors Regarding the Issue of Autumn Grain Conversion in North China:

　　In the 1950 autumn grain collection in North China, the method of collecting grain converted to rice was suddenly adopted, and the calculation was somewhat unreasonable, which aroused dissatisfaction among the farmers who paid the public grain. Therefore, I would like you to explain: Why was this method adopted and how is it calculated?
                  Wang Luoshan

Comrade Wang Luoshan:

    The method of collecting converted grain you mentioned is indeed a problem in some areas of North China. As far as we know, during the 1950 national autumn grain collection conference, in order to balance the burden across regions, it was decided that in all coarse grain areas nationwide, except for wheat being one-to-one, the remaining grains such as millet and sorghum would be calculated at a rate of 70 catties of rice for every 100 catties.

    During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to facilitate the supply of guerrilla warfare and decentralized storage, as well as to prevent the enemy from looting and destroying public grain, millet was collected as public grain. Now, the storage of public grain has changed from decentralized to centralized, and rice is prone to rot and generate heat, making it inconvenient to store. Therefore, it is stipulated that the whole country should collect raw grain instead of rice. The Central People's Government determines the tasks for various regions based on their respective yields, and the yield survey in North China is based on sorghum. When calculating the tasks, the yield is first converted from 100 catties of sorghum to 70 catties of rice. Therefore, when collecting, 70 catties of rice should also be converted into 100 catties of sorghum to pay public grain. The sorghum-rice conversion rate during task calculation should be consistent with the collection conversion rate. In this way, both the public and private sectors will not suffer losses. For example, if the yield is 1 million catties of sorghum, which is converted to 700,000 catties of rice, and the tax rate is 13.5%, the task should be 94,500 catties of rice. If the area collects sorghum, it should also convert 70 catties of rice into 100 catties of sorghum. Collecting 135,000 catties of sorghum is reasonable. If the task is calculated at a 70% conversion rate, but the sorghum collection is at a 74% conversion rate, then the task of 94,500 catties of rice will only require the delivery of 127,000 catties of sorghum. This is equivalent to reducing the tax rate, which is unreasonable.

    Since the method of collecting sorghum is for a reasonable burden, why did the sorghum-rice conversion rate arouse dissatisfaction among the masses in some areas of North China during the 1950 collection? When some areas in North China deployed tasks downwards during the 1950 autumn collection, they did not stipulate how many catties of sorghum each burdened mu should bear. Instead, they followed the old method of stipulating how many catties of rice each burdened mu should collect, and then converted it into 100 catties of sorghum at a ratio of 70 catties of rice, allowing the masses to pay, which led to malpractices. Because the rice yield per 100 catties of sorghum is more than 70 catties, some yield 73, 74, or 75 catties of rice. This caused dissatisfaction among the masses, who mistakenly believed that the local government's stipulated sorghum-rice conversion rate was unreasonable, increasing the burden on the masses, and thought that the local government wanted to demand more from the masses. In areas where dissatisfaction has already been aroused among the masses, the local government should extensively and deeply explain to the masses that the sorghum-rice conversion rate during task calculation is consistent with the collection conversion rate, which means that neither the public nor the private sectors suffer losses, and that the government does not intend to demand anything extra from the masses. It should also be explained to the masses that our calculations of yield and determination of burden are based on sorghum (one dan of sorghum per standard mu), so collecting sorghum is naturally reasonable. If the burden is determined based on sorghum, but sorghum is collected by converting to rice, then areas with good sorghum benefit, and areas with bad sorghum suffer. For example: Assuming that 21 catties of rice are set to be collected per burdened mu, then areas that yield 70 catties of rice must deliver 30 catties of sorghum; areas that yield 74 catties of rice only bear 27 catties of sorghum. But the income of both is one dan of sorghum, which is not a reasonable burden. At the same time, in front of the masses, the local government should also admit that it was an oversight and a shortcoming in the work that it did not stipulate how many catties of sorghum each burdened mu should bear when deploying public grain tasks in the autumn. After the masses understand, they will naturally actively pay public grain and eliminate misunderstandings about the government, thereby strengthening the relationship between the government and the masses.

### 关于华北地区秋征折谷问题

　　关于华北地区秋征折谷问题编者同志：
    一九五○年在华北地区的秋征中，忽然采用了以米折谷征收的办法，而且计算上有些不合理，因而引起了缴纳公粮的农民不满，所以我请你们说明一下：为什么要采用这个办法及怎样折算？
                  王洛山王洛山同志：
    你所提的征收折谷办法，在华北地区某些地方确是一个问题。据我们所知，一九五○年全国秋征会议上计算任务时，为照顾各地负担平衡，因而决定全国杂粮区除小麦一斤顶一斤外，其余粮食如粟、谷等都是按一百斤折成米七十斤计算的。
    抗日战争时期，为了便利游击战争的供给和分散保管，以及防止敌人对公粮的抢夺与破坏，所以，公粮征收小米。现在公粮保管已由分散改为集中，征米容易腐蚀发热，不便保存，因此规定全国都是征原粮不征米。中央人民政府对各地的任务，是按各地产量规定的，华北产量的调查是以谷为单位的。计算任务时，先将产量按每百斤谷折成七十斤米。因此，征收时七十斤米亦应折成一百斤谷子缴纳公粮。计算任务时的谷米折合率，应与征收折合率一致。这样，公私才能都不吃亏。比如产量一百万斤谷，折七十万斤米，按百分之十三点五的税率，应征任务为九万四千五百斤米。该地以谷征收亦应以七十斤米折一百斤谷，实收谷子十三万五千斤，才是合理。如果算任务按七折，收谷按七四折，则九万四千五百斤米的任务，只交十二万七千斤谷。这样等于把税率降低，是不合理的。
    征谷办法既是为了负担合理，那末，为什么一九五○年征收时谷米折合率在华北地区某些地方引起了群众的不满呢？华北地区有些地方一九五○年秋征向下布置任务时，没有规定每一个负担亩负担若干斤谷子，而沿用了过去的老办法，规定每一个负担亩征收若干斤米，再按七十斤米折成一百斤谷子的比例，让群众缴纳，因而发生了弊病。因为每百斤谷子的出米率在七十斤以上，有的出七十三斤或七十四斤、七十五斤米。这样，就引起了群众的不满，误认为当地政府规定的谷米折合率不合理，加重了群众的负担。以为当地政府想向群众多要东西。凡是已经引起群众不满的地方，当地政府应向群众广泛地深入地说明：计算任务时的谷米折合率和征收折合率是一致的，这是公私都不吃亏的，并非想向群众额外要东西。并应向群众说明：我们计算产量，确定负担，都是按谷子（一石谷为一标准亩），那么，征收也应征谷子，自然是合情合理的。如果按谷子定负担，而按米折谷征收，则谷子好的地区沾光，谷子坏的地区吃亏。比如：假定每负担亩定征二十一斤米，则出七十斤米的地区，须交三十斤谷；出七十四斤米的地区，则只负担二十七斤谷子。但两者的收入都是一石谷，这样作负担就不够合理了。同时，在群众面前，当地政府亦应承认在秋季布置公粮任务时，没有规定每一负担亩负担若干斤谷子，是工作上的一个疏忽，是一个缺点。群众了解以后，自然会积极缴纳公粮和消除对政府的误解，从而密切政府与群众之间的关系。
