Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 28th: The Universal Postal Union (UPU) Executive Council meeting opened here on the 25th. The delegation of the People's Republic of China has arrived to attend the meeting. Although the representatives of the People's Republic of China had already participated in the work of the committee in May 1950, the US delegation attempted to seize the seats of the representatives of the People's Republic of China and planned to use several officials from the Kuomintang embassy in Egypt as representatives of China. This attempt was opposed by the delegations of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia.

The head of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, Su Younong, issued a statement exposing the conspiracy of the US delegation, and stated: The delegation of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate Chinese representative to the UPU Executive Council meeting.

After a recess, the committee asked the representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Kuomintang elements to temporarily leave the meeting to continue discussing the issue of Chinese representation. The Soviet delegation proposed recognizing the representatives of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate Chinese representatives in the UPU Executive Council meeting. This proposal was supported by the Czechoslovak representative, who requested that a secret ballot be taken on the Soviet proposal and the US proposal supporting the Kuomintang elements. Despite the opposition of the US and Argentine representatives, the Czechoslovak proposal was ultimately passed.

As a result of the vote, the US delegation's proposal to recognize the Kuomintang elements as Chinese representatives was rejected by a majority, and the Soviet representative's proposal to recognize the delegation of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate representatives was passed.

After the above results were announced, the delegation of the People's Republic of China was invited to participate in the work of the committee, and the Kuomintang elements were asked to leave the meeting.

Therefore, the US delegation's attempt to prevent the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China from participating in the work of the UPU Committee ultimately suffered a shameful defeat.

　　万国邮政联盟执委会通过苏联提案
    承认我国代表为唯一合法代表
    美国提案遭否决蒋匪帮代表被逐出会场
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社开罗二十七日讯：万国邮政联盟执行委员会会议于二十五日在此间揭幕。中华人民共和国代表团业已前来出席会议。虽然中华人民共和国的代表们在一九五○年五月已经参加该委员会会议的工作，但是美国代表团却企图夺去中华人民共和国代表们的席位，而计划以国民党驻埃及大使馆的几个官吏们作为中国的代表。这一企图受到了中华人民共和国、苏联、和捷克斯洛伐克代表团的反对。
    中华人民共和国代表团团长苏幼农发表声明，揭穿美国代表团的阴谋，并称：中华人民共和国代表团是万国邮政联盟唯一合法的中国代表。
    休息过后，委员会请中华人民共和国代表和国民党分子代表暂时退席，继续讨论中国代表问题。苏联代表团提议承认中华人民共和国代表为万国邮政联盟执行委员会会议中唯一合法的中国代表。这个提案受到捷克斯洛伐克代表的支持，他要求对苏联的提案和美国支持国民党分子的提案采取秘密表决的方法。尽管有美国代表和阿根廷代表反对，捷克斯洛伐克的提案终被通过。
    表决结果，美国代表团承认国民党分子为中国代表的提案被大多数所否决，苏联代表的承认中华人民共和国代表团为合法代表的提案被通过。
    上项结果宣布以后，中华人民共和国代表团即被邀参加委员会的工作，而国民党分子就被请离开会场。
    因此，美国代表团企图阻止中华人民共和国合法代表参加万国邮政联盟委员会工作一事，最终遭受了可耻的失败。
