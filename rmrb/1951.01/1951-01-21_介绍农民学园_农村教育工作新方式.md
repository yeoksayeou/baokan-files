　　Introducing Farmers' Academies
　　A New Approach to Rural Education
　　Huang Dongsen
　　The Farmers' Academy is the Beijing Agricultural University's rural education workstation in the suburbs of Beijing, and is a school for farmers; through it, the cultural level of farmers can be gradually improved and their experience absorbed. It has been loved and welcomed by farmers.
　　The Farmers' Academy is located in Shifangyuan in the western suburbs of Beijing, and its work scope covers the eight natural villages belonging to Madao Temple. The students are male and female farmers from nearby villages, and the teachers are comrades from the workstation. It includes a people's school, a public reading room, and a public technology room.
　　The Farmers' Academy closely integrates cultural learning with the learning of production knowledge. On the one hand, it tries to select practical teaching materials related to production, and on the other hand, it combines cultural learning to explain production knowledge, such as introducing seed selection knowledge to farmers during the autumn harvest; when cabbage gets aphids, it explains the life history and treatment methods of aphids; when planting wheat, the teachers bring microscopes to show the students the spores of black blight. Sometimes, the method of "everyone talking" is adopted in the classroom to allow students to introduce their production experience, and finally, the teachers provide theoretical explanations. When teaching cultural classes, teaching is carried out in conjunction with the calculation of row spacing, the preparation of insecticides, and so on. In this way, the effect of teaching each other and making progress together is truly achieved.
　　The public reading room of the Farmers' Academy is equipped with a large number of popular readings for farmers, charts of diseases and insect pests, and physical specimens for students and general farmers to visit and read. As for the public technology room, those who are not familiar with it will definitely be surprised after seeing it. Under the guidance of scientific theory, it takes rural practical production as the research object and the land and crops of the students as the research materials. In 1950, in order to carry out the cultivation research of the world's highest-yielding branching wheat, twelve student households were invited as special farm households, and they planted branching wheat on their own land. One hundred and twenty households are trying to mix wheat seeds with Gu Ren Le Sheng; fifteen special farm households are trying to use sodium fluorosilicate to treat mole crickets; thirty-four households are doing grain seed experiments; in addition, wheat field winter fertilizer experiments are also being carried out.
　　In addition, political and ideological education has been carried out for the students in a planned and focused manner. In conjunction with the patriotic movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, widespread publicity has been carried out. Through the dissemination of the students, the work of the workstation has become more and more stable. It has become the laboratory, farm, and experimental field of the Agricultural University. The classroom is connected with the vast countryside. Through it, the problems encountered in rural production are quickly sent to the research room for scientific research; and through it, the research results are quickly sent to the vast countryside.
　　The Farmers' Academy has won the welcome of the folks in the villages near Madao Temple.
　　The future of the Farmers' Academy is bright. We believe that their successful experience will soon be applied to other workstations in North China.

　　介绍农民学园
    农村教育工作新方式
    黄东森
    农民学园是北京农大京郊农村教育工作站，是一所农民学校；通过它，可以逐渐地提高农民的文化程度，吸取他们的经验。它已受到农民的热爱与欢迎。
    农民学园设于京市西郊什方院，它以马道庙所属八个自然村为工作范围。学员都是附近各村的男女农民，教员是工作站的同志们。内设民校、大众阅览室、大众技术室。
    农民学园把文化学习与生产知识学习密切结合起来。一面尽量选择切合实用的生产教材，一面结合文化学习讲解生产知识，如在秋收时向农民介绍选种知识；白菜生了蚜虫，就讲蚜虫的生活史及治法；种麦时，教师带着显微镜叫学员们看黑疽病的胞子。有时在课堂上采取大家谈的方式，让学员们把自己的生产经验介绍出来，最后由教员加以理论的解说。上文化课时则结合行株距的计算，杀虫药剂的配制等进行教学。这样就真正收了到教学相长，共同进步的效果。
    农民学园所设的大众阅览室，备有大批农民通俗读物，病虫害挂图，实物标本等，供学员和一般农民参观和阅读。至于大众技术室，不熟悉的人，看了之后一定会觉得惊讶。它在科学理论的指导下，以农村实际生产为研究对象，以学员们的土地和庄稼为研究材料。一九五○年，为了进行世界上产量最大的分枝小麦的栽培研究，十二户学员被邀为特约农家，他们在自己的土地上种了分枝小麦。一百零二十户农家在试用谷仁乐生拌麦种；十五户特约农家试用氟矽酸钠治蝼蛄；三十四户作谷种试验；此外还作了麦田冬肥等试验。
    此外还有计划有重点地向学员们进行了政治思想教育，结合抗美援朝的爱国运动，广泛进行了宣传，通过学员们的传播，工作站的工作愈来愈稳固了。它已成为农业大学的实验室、农场、试验场。课堂与广大农村沟通起来了。通过它，农村生产上所遭遇到的问题迅速被送到研究室进行科学研究；又通过它迅速地将研究成果送到广大农村。
    农民学园博取了马道庙附近各村老乡们的欢迎。
    农民学园的前途是远大的。我们相信，他们成功的经验将很快地被运用到华北其他各地工作站去。
