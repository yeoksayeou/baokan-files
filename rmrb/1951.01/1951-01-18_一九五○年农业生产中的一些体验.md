　　Some Experiences in Agricultural Production in 1950
    Li Shucheng
    In the first year of the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the agricultural front, like other fronts, achieved tremendous success. The total grain production in the country reached 240.2 billion jin, an increase of 20.2 billion jin compared with 1949, reaching 85.7 percent of the pre-war output. The total cotton production was 14.21 million dan (ginned cotton), an increase of 5.33 million dan compared with 1949, reaching 83.7 percent of the highest pre-war output (1936). The production of other special products also largely completed the plan. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the national agricultural production had once declined to about 75 percent of the pre-war level. Last year's bumper harvest has enabled the rural economy to recover and develop rapidly, creating a good condition for striving for a turn for the better in the national financial and economic situation.
    How did the great achievements in agricultural production in 1950 come about? Moderate rainfall is certainly an objective reason, but fundamentally, it is the result of the stable social order after the victory of the People's Liberation War, the correct leadership of the People's Government, the efforts of cadres at all levels, and the active labor of the broad masses of peasants. Looking back on the production work of the past year, I feel that the following issues are very important.
    1. Implementing policies is the prerequisite for developing production. At the beginning of the spring plowing season, some remnants of agricultural socialist ideas still remained among the peasants, fearing to "stand out" and not daring to let go of production. The spring plowing instructions issued by the Government Administration Council, the instructions on land reform and public grain collection in the new areas, and the policies for protecting and rewarding production issued by people's governments at all levels, such as the Ten Policies promulgated by the Central South Region, the Six Prohibitions issued by the East China Region, and the proclamation issued by Shanxi Province on protecting private property and protecting labor income, played a decisive role in encouraging the production enthusiasm of the masses and stabilizing rural order. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government also issued reasonable grain and cotton price ratios, providing a strong guarantee for rewarding the masses for planting cotton and completing the cotton planting plan. However, for flue-cured tobacco, the price policy was not issued in time, causing farmers to fear losses from planting tobacco, so the planting area was far from the plan. Also, the price of cowhide was not paid enough attention to for a while, which resulted in killing a lot of cattle in individual provinces. These experiences require leading organs at all levels to better grasp and implement various policies related to production in carrying out the large-scale production movement in 1951.
    2. Overcoming natural disasters and improving farming standards are important links in developing agricultural production. In 1950, people's governments in various places effectively led farmers to prevent floods, protect 70 million mu of cultivated land, and led farmers to carry out a large-scale rice borer control campaign, with a control area of more than 60 million mu. Extensive farmland water conservancy work has been carried out, benefiting an area of more than 40 million mu. Therefore, the national bumper harvest in 1950 was guaranteed. However, various natural disasters are still a serious obstacle to the development of agricultural production. According to statistics, the amount of reduced production due to disasters in North China is close to the amount of public grain. Therefore, an important task in agricultural production in the future is to: continue to vigorously build water conservancy projects to prevent floods and droughts; improve the scientific knowledge of the masses to prevent and control pests and diseases; and massively close mountains for afforestation, build various shelterbelts, conserve water and soil, regulate the climate, so as to gradually change natural conditions, as well as lead and organize farmers to improve farming methods, improve agricultural technology, promote deep plowing, more hoeing, accumulating manure and composting green manure, promote new farm tools, advocate selecting seeds and changing seeds, promote pesticides and machinery, increase and improve the breeds of farm animals, and pay attention to improving soil quality.
    3. The mass line is the correct method to lead agricultural production. The strength of the masses is strong, and the wisdom of the masses is infinite. Agricultural production in 1950 fully proved this truth. Taking water conservancy construction as an example, the medium and small-sized water conservancy projects built by the masses last year accounted for more than three-quarters of the total area of water conservancy construction. Jiangxi Province originally planned to build 2,460 ponds, but relying on the masses and giving play to the strength of the masses, 10,295 ponds were completed, greatly exceeding the original plan. In Zhejiang's pest control work, a warm mass pest control movement was launched throughout the province. Only rice borer eggs collected reached more than 250 million, and more than 400 million rice borer moths and 24,000 jin were captured, and more than 20 million rice borer larvae and pupae and 2,700 jin were captured. Thus ensuring the bumper harvest of rice.
    In terms of agricultural technology, the masses also have many creations and inventions. For example, Liu Jubao, a labor model and technical expert in Shanxi, selected and bred early northern melon, early jade corn, and early-maturing rice varieties, which can mature half a month earlier than ordinary local varieties. Farmers in Wendeng, Shandong, selected flat-eared wheat, which can increase production by more than 20% compared with ordinary varieties. Gao Guandou, a labor model in Da Hujiazhuang, Hebei, improved 18 qing of alkaline land out of 19 qing in the whole village, which can increase output by three times. Farmers invented a method of cutting ditches to wait for rain in dry weather, so they can sow and emerge seedlings when it rains a little. Farmers in Shanxi and Pingyuan and other places established small farms to conduct various experiments on fertilization and cultivation. Some villages also established technical groups to study cultivation technology according to the production season and guide the masses. There are many examples of effective improvement of production technology like this. Therefore, as long as we are good at organizing and leading the masses and learning from the masses, summing up the experience of the masses, the production movement can be carried out in big strides, and production technology can also be improved rapidly.
    4. "Organizing" is the best way to develop production. The experience of the past year has further proved the superiority of labor mutual aid in developing production. In places where labor mutual aid is sound, not only production difficulties have been overcome, but also the production level has been greatly improved. Liu Jubao, a technical expert in Shanxi, initially did not believe in the benefits of organizing, thinking that as long as there is a higher technology, production can be increased, but since the implementation of mutual aid production began in 1945, there has been the following difference in the item of plowing land alone: Under the same conditions, only 25% of those who plowed the land three times when working alone, and after organizing, the land plowed three times reached 93%, labor mutual aid is the basic method of organizing the masses to develop production. In 1951, we should strengthen the leadership of labor mutual aid. The labor mutual aid in the old areas should move forward from the low-level basis of "allocate labor when there is work, and disband when there is no work." Labor mutual aid should be closely combined with improving technology and improving farming standards, and can jointly build water conservancy projects, jointly buy large farm tools, and cooperate in afforestation on a voluntary basis to promote labor mutual aid; the new areas should also start from typical examples, starting from small mutual aid groups that are voluntary and beneficial to both parties, and introduce the experience of the old areas well, and gradually develop labor mutual aid.
    Finally, leading production should be good at giving the masses instructions on the direction and cultivating the enthusiasm of the masses. Different natural conditions should lead the masses to develop different production undertakings. Mountainous areas should study "relying on mountains to eat mountains," water areas should study production methods suitable for water areas, and different production foundations should propose different goals; In areas where production has recovered, we must move forward further. The leadership's empiricism and conservatism hinder the progress of mass production. The production in the old areas already has a considerable foundation, and this year we should launch a production increase competition to better promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and rapidly and comprehensively restore and exceed the pre-war production level.

　　一九五○年农业生产中的一些体验
    李书城
    中华人民共和国开国的第一年，在毛主席的正确领导下，农业战线和其他各战线一样，获得了巨大的成就。全国生产粮食共达二、四○二亿斤，较一九四九年增产二○二亿斤，达到战前产量百分之八五·七。生产棉花共一、四二一万市担（皮棉），较一九四九年增产五三三万市担，达战前最高产量（一九三六年）百分之八三·七。其他特产亦大部完成计划。自抗日战争以来，全国的农业生产，曾一度下降到战前水平的百分之七十五左右，去年这一丰收，已使农村经济迅速恢复与发展，而为争取全国财政经济的好转，创造了一个良好条件。
    一九五○年农业生产的巨大成绩是怎样得来的呢？雨水调匀固然是客观原因，但基本上则是人民解放战争胜利后，社会秩序安定，人民政府正确领导，各级干部努力，以及广大农民群众积极劳动的结果。回顾一年来的生产工作，我感到下面的几个问题是很重要的。
    一、贯彻政策，是发展生产的前提。春耕开始时，农民中间还残存着一些农业社会主义残余思想，怕“冒尖”，不敢放手生产。政务院发布的春耕指示，新区土地改革及征收公粮的指示，与各级人民政府发布的保护与奖励生产政策，如中南区颁布的十大政策、华东区发布的六项禁令、山西省发布的保护私有财产与保护劳动所得布告等，对于鼓舞群众的生产情绪，安定农村秩序，起了决定性作用。中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会又曾发布了合理的粮棉比价，对奖励群众植棉，完成植棉计划，提出了有力的保证。但对烤烟一项，因比价政策没有及时发布，使农民害怕种烟吃亏，以致栽种面积距离计划甚远。又如牛皮价格亦因一时注意不够，在个别省份竟因而杀掉不少耕牛。这些经验，使各级领导机关在一九五一年开展大生产运动中，必须更好地掌握与贯彻各项有关生产的政策。
    二、克服自然灾害，提高耕作水平，是发展农业生产的重要环节。一九五○年各地人民政府曾领导农民有效地防止了水灾，保护了耕地七千万亩，并领导农民开展了大规模的治螟除虫运动，防治面积达六千余万亩。广泛开展了农田水利工作，受益面积达四千万余亩。因而保证了一九五○年的全国丰收。但各种自然灾害，仍为目前农业生产发展上的严重障碍，据统计，华北因灾害而减产的数量与公粮数量相近。因此，今后农业生产中的重要任务是：继续大力兴修水利，防止水、旱灾；提高群众科学知识，以防除病虫害；并大规模地封山育林，营造各种保安林，保持水土，调剂气候，以逐步改变自然条件，以及领导和组织农民改进耕作方法，提高农业技术，提倡深耕、多锄、积粪沤绿肥，推广新农具，提倡选种换种、推广农药器械，增殖与改良耕畜品种，并注意改良土质等。
    三、走群众路线是领导农业生产的正确方法。群众的力量是雄厚的，群众的智慧是无限的，一九五○年的农业生产中又充分证明了这一真理。如以兴修水利为例，去年群众组织起来兴修的中小水利占兴修水利总面积的四分之三以上。江西省原计划修塘二、四六○座，由于依靠群众，发挥了群众力量，即完成了一○、二九五座，大大超过了原计划。浙江防除虫害工作，在全省范围内掀起了热烈的群众除虫运动，仅采稻螟卵即达二亿五千余万块，捕捉螟蛾四亿余只又两万四千余斤，捉螟幼虫与蛹二千余万个又二千七百斤。从而保证了水稻的丰收。
    在农业技术方面，群众也有很多创造和发明。如山西劳模技术能手刘聚宝选育出早北瓜，早玉茭，早熟稻等品种较当地一般品种可早熟半月。山东文登农民选出扁穗小麦，较一般品种增产二成以上。河北大护驾庄劳动模范高贯斗，将全村十九顷碱地改良了十八顷，可提高产量三倍。农民在天旱时发明了豁沟待雨的办法，遇小雨就可以下种出苗。山西、平原等地农民创立了小型农场，进行施肥耕作各种试验，有的村庄还建立了技术小组，按生产季节研究耕作技术，指导群众。像这种有效改进生产技术的事例是很多的。因此，只要我们善于组织与领导群众并向群众学习，总结群众的经验，生产运动便能大踏步地开展起来，生产技术也能迅速提高。
    四、“组织起来”是发展生产最好的方法。一年来的经验，进一步证明了劳动互助对发展生产的优越性，凡是劳动互助健全的地方，就不仅克服了生产困难，而且大大提高了生产水平。山西技术能手刘聚宝最初不相信组织起来的好处，以为只要有较高的技术就可以增产，但自一九四五年开始实行互助生产以后，只耕翻地一项，便有如下差别：在各种条件相同的情况下单干时地耕三遍者只占百分之二十五，组织起来以后，则耕翻三遍的土地达到百分之九十三，劳动互助是组织群众发展生产的基本方法。我们在一九五一年应加强对劳动互助的领导，老区的劳力互助应从“有活就拨工，无活就散伙”的低级基础上向前提高一步。劳动互助要与提高技术，提高耕作水平密切结合起来，并可在自愿的基础上合修水利，合买大农具，合作造林，以推进劳动互助；新区也应从典型作起，从自愿两利的小型互助组入手，并很好地介绍老区经验，逐步地发展劳力互助。
    最后，领导生产要善于给群众指示方向，并培养群众的积极性。不同的自然情况，应领导群众发展不同的生产事业，山地应研究“靠山吃山”，水区要研究适应水区的生产方法、不同的生产基础，要提出不同的目标；在生产已恢复的地区，要进一步向前发展，领导上的经验主义固步自封，就阻碍群众生产的前进。老区生产已有相当基础，今年应开展增产竞赛运动，以便更好地发扬群众的积极性与创造性，迅速地全面地恢复与超过战前生产水平。
