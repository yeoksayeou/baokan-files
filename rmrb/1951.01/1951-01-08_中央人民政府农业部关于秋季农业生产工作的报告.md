Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The following is the Report of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on Autumn Agricultural Production Work (Report by Minister Li Shucheng at the 61st Administrative Meeting of the State Council on December 1, 1950, and approved by the same meeting):

    The autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing work of 1950 throughout the country were nearly completed by the beginning of November. Looking at the country as a whole, the achievements far surpassed those of last year.

    I. Autumn Harvest: Started in August and ended by the end of October. Except for late rice in some areas such as Guangdong, the rest of the country has been completed. In general, the harvest was timely. This year, grains, cotton, and various specialties have all had bumper harvests. The total national autumn grain production was 202.7 billion jin of raw grain, and the total cotton production was 14.21 million dan of ginned cotton. The harvest in the Northeast was more than 85%, North China averaged 80%, East China averaged more than 80%, Central and Southern China generally 80%, parts of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces reached 90%, Northwest China averaged 70%, Southwest China generally reached 80% except for parts of Guizhou province where production was reduced due to drought, the Western Sichuan area reached more than 90%, and Inner Mongolia had the worst harvest due to severe drought, but it also maintained last year's level. In total, the national autumn and summer grain harvest was 240.2 billion jin, exceeding last year by 20.2 billion jin. The total cotton production was 14.21 million dan of ginned cotton, exceeding last year by 5.41 million dan.

    The work of selecting seeds during the autumn harvest was improved from the original field selection basis. The number of field selections by the masses in the old liberated areas has greatly increased: 60% of households in Hebei Province conducted seed selection, of which field selection accounted for one-third; in Jiaozhou Prefecture, Shandong, 80% to 90% of households selected seeds, and more than half of them carried out field selection. Various localities also paid attention to improving seed selection techniques and conducted seed selection training for cadres and farmers, and the new areas also mobilized the masses to select seeds with a focus.

    The order of the autumn harvest was good. Except for individual areas, the number of thefts and sabotage incidents was greatly reduced. The troops stationed in the new areas assisted the masses in protecting the autumn harvest, and the farmers were very grateful.

    II. Autumn Planting: This year, the wheat planting area is generally smaller than last year. The reasons are: on the one hand, drought and floods occurred one after another in September and October, which affected the autumn planting work; on the other hand, the plan was to increase cotton production and expand cotton fields, so the wheat planting area was reduced or only maintained at last year's level. Only the flood-stricken areas and other non-cotton planting areas have seen some increases. According to reports: Pingyuan Province decreased by more than 1.7 million mu compared with last year, Hebei Province decreased by more than 14.4 million mu compared with last year, and Shandong decreased by more than 1 million mu compared with last year; while in the flood-stricken areas such as Fuyang and Suxian Prefectures in northern Anhui, more than 70% of the cultivated land had been planted with wheat before the end of October (part was flooded in mid-to-late October due to continuous rain). In addition, the new areas where land reform was implemented this winter generally maintained last year's level of winter crop area, and some even exceeded it, as a result of in-depth publicity of the policy.

    This year, there has been great progress in the promotion of improved varieties, seed soaking, and seed dressing: Shandong used the method of changing varieties to prevent the occurrence of wheat smut in areas with serious wheat smut; 40% of the seeds in Shanxi were soaked or dressed; in Zanhuang County, Hebei, 80% of the villages soaked seeds, and 70% of the households soaked seeds; The East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry distributed 8 million jin of wheat seeds after dressing them with medicine; Pingyuan Province promoted 4.4 million jin of improved varieties and generally conducted germination tests. However, individual areas still made careless mistakes. For example, Wanquan Farm in Shanxi did not conduct tests beforehand when dressing seeds for the masses, and the improper use of medicine caused the seeds to fail to germinate due to drug damage.

    This year, the quantity and quality of fertilizer applied to wheat fields have been improved: Shanxi generally applied 5 to 10 dan more fertilizer per mu than last year, and households in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong, generally applied about two loads of fertilizer more to wheat fields.

    In the spring wheat area, there has been new development in the trial planting and promotion of winter wheat: 90,000 hectares have been promoted in the Northeast, 1,700 mu have been promoted in Suiyuan, 3,540 mu have been trial-planted in Ningxia, and more than 3,200 mu have been trial-planted in Chahar. Gansu and Qinghai have also conducted experiments. In the future, there is great hope for the expansion of winter wheat to the northwest of our country.

    III. Autumn Plowing: The Northeast has no habit of autumn plowing. This year, all 440,000 hectares of cotton, hemp, and specialty products in eastern Liaoning were plowed in autumn, and fruit tree areas also carried out autumn plowing. North China generally maintained last year's autumn plowing area; by the end of October, 70% of the general areas of Hebei had been plowed, and some areas reached 90%, Shanxi reached a maximum of 80% and a minimum of 40%, Chabei Prefecture in Chahar had completed all autumn plowing, and autumn plowing in Chanan reached 93% of the arable land, and Yanbei reached 82%, which not only exceeded last year but also exceeded the pre-war level. In East China and Central China, efforts were made to plow all the winter fallow land once or twice; the general farmers changed the past habits of "half a year of hard work and half a year of leisure" and "chopping thatch in September and playing cards in October." The winter plowing in the Southwest region was one month earlier this year, and the area has exceeded last year. However, looking at the country as a whole, the achievements and progress of autumn plowing are very uneven. At present, except for northern North China where the ground is frozen and autumn plowing has completely stopped, the south can still plow for half a day, while Central and Southern China are still carrying out winter plowing.

    IV. Future Suggestions:

    (1) After the bumper harvest, the purchasing power of farmers has increased significantly, which not only creates a broad market for industrial products, but also lays a favorable foundation for agricultural development next year. Sichuan farmers said: "This year is a year of double happiness (referring to bumper harvest and rent reduction)." Half of the farmers in western Liaoning Province added carts and bought horses, more than 80,000 livestock were added in Handan Prefecture, Hebei, and chemical fertilizers purchased from local product companies in Zhejiang alone reached 3.9 million jin in three months. Therefore, in leadership, we must make full use of the favorable conditions of the bumper harvest to call on farmers to add carts and buy horses, repair and manufacture agricultural tools, purchase fertilizers, build water conservancy projects, and prevent and control pests and diseases to expand reproduction.

    (2) After the bumper harvest, people's living standards have also improved, and the demand for wheat will inevitably increase, but the winter wheat planting area in North China and Henan and Shandong this year has not expanded (and even decreased in some areas). Therefore, mobilizing and organizing farmers to water winter wheat and protect wheat seedlings, and universally hoeing wheat and applying topdressing fertilizer next spring to ensure increased production per unit area, should arouse the high attention of leading organs.

    (3) In order to strive to supply sufficient textile raw materials, expand the production of yarn and cloth, and meet the needs of increased people's purchasing power, the plan to expand cotton fields in the next two years should be completed within one year next year. Therefore, preparations must be made this winter and next spring, such as publicizing the facts that planting cotton is profitable and guaranteeing the cotton-grain price ratio, improving measures for purchasing cotton, ensuring the implementation of price policies, organizing the masses to formulate cotton planting plans, and solving the difficulties in expanding cotton fields.

    (4) Although the country has had a bumper harvest, some areas have still suffered serious disasters. In these areas, we must strengthen leadership to farmers to carry out production for self-salvation, overcome disasters, and support spring plowing next year. In particular, in disaster areas such as northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan, we should vigorously organize disaster victims to carry out various diversified sideline productions and, where possible, organize work in exchange for rations. The view and practice of solely relying on limited government relief funds to solve the living problems of disaster victims have been proven wrong by many experiences.

    (5) The achievements of this year's agricultural production are, on the one hand, due to favorable weather conditions and a better year, and more importantly, the active labor of the vast number of farmers after liberation and the correct leadership of the people's governments at all levels and the Communist Party, and the active implementation of the policy of increasing agricultural production. In the future, this policy should continue to be actively implemented. It is necessary to prevent complacency and paralysis due to the bumper harvest and relax leadership over production. At present, we should give full play to the labor and resources of hundreds of millions of farmers to carry out winter production and lay the foundation for more increased production next year.

　　中央人民政府农业部关于秋季农业生产工作的报告
    【新华社六日讯】中央人民政府农业部关于秋季农业生产工作的报告（李书城部长在一九五零年十二月一日政务院第六十一次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    一九五零年全国的秋收、秋种、秋耕工作，至十一月初已近结束。从全国来看，成绩远超过去年。
    一、秋收：自八月开始，至十月底止，除广东等部分地区晚稻尚未收完外，其余各地已全部结束。一般做到收割适时。今年粮食、棉花及各种特产均告丰收，全国秋粮共产原粮二○二七亿斤，棉花共产皮棉一四二一万市担。东北年成在八成半以上，华北平均八成，华东平均八成以上，中南一般八成，湖南、江西两省部分地区达九成，西北平均七成，西南除贵州部分地区因旱减产外，一般达八成，川西地区则在九成以上，内蒙因旱灾较重，收成最差，但亦保持了去年水平。总计全国秋、夏两季收获粮食为二四○二亿斤，超过去年二○二亿斤。棉花共计皮棉一四二一万市担，超过去年五四一万市担。
    对于秋粮选种工作，在原有场间选种基础上提高了一步。老区群众田间选种数量大增：河北省百分之六十的户进行了选种，其中田间选种的可占三分之一；山东胶州专区选种户占百分之八十至九十，其中一半以上进行田间选种。各地并注意了提高选种技术，进行了干部、农民的选种训练，新区亦有重点地发动了群众选种。
    秋收秩序良好，除个别地区外，一般偷窃破坏事件大大减少。新区驻军协助群众保卫秋收，农民十分感激。
    二、秋种：今年小麦播种面积一般少于去年，其原因：一方面由于九、十月间旱涝相继，影响了秋种工作；另一方面又由于计划增加棉产，扩大棉田，所以小麦播种面积减少，或仅维持去年的水平，只有水灾区及其他非植棉区，则有部分增加。据报告：平原省比去年减少一百七十余万亩，河北省比去年减少一千四百余万亩，山东比去年减少一百余万亩；而水灾区如皖北阜阳、宿县两专区十月底以前已种麦达耕地百分之七十（十月中下旬连雨淹毁一部）。此外今冬实行土地改革的新区，因深入宣传政策的结果，冬季作物面积，一般均维持了去年水平，部分且有超过。
    对于良种推广、浸种、拌种工作，今年有很大进步：山东黑穗病严重地区用换种办法防止黑穗病发生，山西百分之四十的种籽进行了浸种或拌种，河北赞皇县浸种村占百分之八十，浸种户占百分之七十；华东农林部八○○万斤麦种用药剂拌好后才分发下去；平原省推广良种四四○万斤，普遍作了发芽试验。但个别地区仍犯有粗枝大叶错误，如山西万全农场，替群众拌种事先未作试验，用药不当，致使种籽因受药害不能发芽。
    今年麦田的施肥数量与质量均有提高：山西每亩施肥普遍较去年增多五担至十担，山东莱阳专区一般户麦田增肥二驮左右。
    在春小麦区，试种与推广冬麦有了新的发展：东北推广了九万垧，绥远推广了一、七○○亩，宁夏试种三、五四○亩，察哈尔试种三、二○○余亩，甘肃、青海亦均进行试验。将来冬小麦向我国西北部扩大极有希望。
    三、秋耕：东北地区向无秋耕习惯，今年辽东四十四万垧棉麻特产地全部秋翻，果树地区也均进行秋翻。华北一般均维持了去年秋耕面积；十月底河北一般地区耕完百分之七十，个别地区达百分之九十，山西最高达百分之八十，最低百分之四十，察哈尔察北专区已全部秋耕，察南秋耕已达应耕地百分之九三，雁北达百分之八二，不但超过去年且超过了战前水平。华东、华中冬闲地争取全部翻耕一遍到两遍；一般农民改变了过去“半年辛苦半年闲”、“九月砍茅柴，十月斗纸牌”的习惯。西南区今年冬耕提早一月，面积已超过去年。但就全国看来，秋耕成绩和进度很不平衡，目前除华北北部封冻秋耕完全停止外，南部尚能耕半晌，华中、华南则仍在进行冬耕。
    四、今后的意见：
    （一）丰收后农民购买力显著提高，不仅给工业产品创造了广阔的市场，而且给明年农业发展奠定了有利基础。四川农民说：“今年是双喜年（指丰收与减租）。”辽西省有半数农户添车买马，河北邯郸专区增加牲畜八万余头，浙江三个月中仅从土产公司购买化学肥料即达三百九十万斤。因此在领导上必须充分利用丰收的有利条件，号召农民添车买马、修制农具、购买肥料、兴修水利、防治虫害等，以扩大再生产。
    （二）丰收后人民生活水平也随之提高，小麦的需要量必将增加，但今年华北及河南、山东等地冬麦播种面积并未扩大（甚至有些减少），因此发动与组织农民浇冬水、保麦苗，明春普遍锄麦、施追肥，保证单位面积的增产，应引起领导机关的高度重视。
    （三）为了争取供给足够纺织原料，扩大纱布的产量，适应人民购买力提高的需要，应将明后两年扩大棉田的计划于明年一年内完成。因此，今冬、明春必须作好准备工作，如宣传种棉获利的事实及棉粮比价的保证，改善收购棉花的措施，保证价格政策的执行，组织群众制定种棉计划，解决扩大棉田中的困难。
    （四）虽然全国丰收，但有些地区仍然遭受了严重的灾害，在这些地区必须加强领导农民生产自救，度过灾荒，支持明年的春耕。特别是皖北、苏北、河北、河南等灾区，更应大力组织灾民开展多种多样的副业生产，在可能条件下组织以工代账。单纯依靠政府有限的救济粮款解决灾民的生活问题的观点与作法，多次经验证明是不对的。
    （五）今年的农业生产成绩的获得，一方面固然是雨水调和，年成较好，而更重要的是广大农民在解放后的积极劳动及各级人民政府与共产党的正确领导，积极执行了增加农业生产的方针。今后仍应积极执行这个方针。要防止因丰收而产生的自满麻痹情绪，放松了对生产的领导。目前应充分发挥几万万农民的劳力、资力进行冬季生产，奠定明年更多增产的基础。
