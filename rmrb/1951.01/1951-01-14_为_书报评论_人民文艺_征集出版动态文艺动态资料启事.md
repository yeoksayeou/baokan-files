　　Solicitation for Publication Trends and Literary and Art Trends Materials for "Book and Newspaper Review" and "People's Literature and Art"

　　This newspaper's "People's Literature and Art" weekly and "Book and Newspaper Review" weekly (merged from this newspaper's two bi-weekly publications in 1950, "Book Review" and "News Work") will respectively add two columns, Literary and Art Trends and Publication Trends, starting from this issue and the next, recording significant activities in the publishing, magazine, news, literature, and art circles nationwide and abroad in short texts on a regular basis. We believe that systematically publishing such records will be beneficial for current work guidance and future historical research. However, our newspaper has limited manpower and a limited scope of knowledge. To do this work well, we must rely on the full cooperation of publishing workers, news workers, and literary and art workers across the country. We hope that all relevant parties will actively provide this newspaper with the materials needed for these two columns, so that they can become a faithful record of the publishing, news, and literary and art work of our time.

　　为“书报评论”“人民文艺”征集出版动态文艺动态资料启事
    本报的“人民文艺”周刊和“书报评论”周刊（由本报一九五○年的“图书评论”和“新闻工作”两种双周刊合并）分别从本期及下期开始增设文艺动态、出版动态两栏，按期用简短的文字纪录全国以及国外的出版界、杂志界、新闻界、文学界、艺术界的有重要意义的活动。我们认为，有系统地发表这种纪录，无论对于当前的工作指导，或是对于将来的历史研究，都是有益的。但是本报人手有限，见闻不广，为了把这个工作作好，必须依靠全国的出版工作者、新闻工作者和文艺工作者的通力合作。希望有关各方面踊跃地供给本报以这两栏所需要的资料，使它们成为我们时代的出版工作、新闻工作、文艺工作的忠实的纪录。
