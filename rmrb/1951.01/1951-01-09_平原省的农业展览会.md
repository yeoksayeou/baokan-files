　　Ni Jianzhong

　　Following the Pingyuan Province Agricultural and Forestry Model Worker Conference, the Department of Agriculture hosted an agricultural exhibition starting December 11th. It lasted ten days. On the banks of the Meng Jiangnu River, at the eastern end of Jiefang Road in Xinxiang City, on the original site of a former Japanese "shrine," were displayed the glorious achievements of agricultural production in the province. The exhibits inspired people's labor enthusiasm and interest, and provided specific instructions for increasing production.

　　The Water Conservancy Hall displayed various types of well-water lifting vehicles. The Liberation-style was the most exquisite and lightweight. Statistical charts showed that the province's main irrigation water source was well water. Only Anyang and Xinxiang prefectures used river and canal irrigation. The hall had two large irrigation and flood control models: one was the Victory Canal, a major canal completed in 1949 in Anyang Prefecture, with a total length of 14 kilometers, irrigating 38,000 mu of land and providing a large amount of water to the Wanjin Canal to the south; the other was the Nanyang Lake dike, which was built for 53.5 kilometers in the spring of this year, raised by two meters, and had a telephone line to the special commissioner's office for flood control command. The completion of the canals and dikes played a significant role in agricultural production in 1950.

　　The Labor Model Deeds Hall displayed photos of the production activities of Cheng Baifu, a special-class labor model of the province, and several other agricultural and forestry labor models. The production achievements of the labor models and the pictures of them being respected by the people attracted a large audience.

　　The Wheat Crop Hall displayed the province's three major fine wheat varieties: 1. Youzi Wheat, mostly planted in Puyang Prefecture. Its characteristics are large grains, thin skin, high flour yield, and a harvest that is 15 to 30 percent higher than ordinary wheat; 2. Xuzhou 438 Wheat, mostly planted in Huxi Prefecture, with a harvest that is 20 percent higher than Youzi Wheat; 3. Pingyuan 50 Wheat, which was tested and planted in Xinxiang Prefecture after being verified in 1950. It has good quality, high yield, and strong straw, making it resistant to wind.

　　The Cotton Crop Hall mainly displayed Sizi Cotton, which is a recognized high-quality cotton variety. The provincial farm harvested 460 jin of Sizi Cotton per mu. It has been widely sown in the province, with cotton fields reaching 3,288,308 mu. The highest yield harvested by labor models in the province is 400 jin per mu. It also includes instructions on relevant technologies for achieving increased production. In addition, it also displayed a simple model of the spinning process of Zhongyuan Yarn Factory and its products.

　　The Miscellaneous Grain Hall displayed specimens of excellent varieties of crops such as sorghum, corn, soybeans, and sweet potatoes. The millet includes Huanong No. 4; the sorghum includes No. 2004 and Zhuganqing; the soybeans include Dahuangdou; the corn includes Huanong No. 2 and Dahongpao; the sweet potatoes include Shengli No. 100 and Nonglin No. 4. A sweet potato grown by a labor model in Fengqiu weighed 18 jin. In addition, there are also the specialty yam of Qinyang County (Huaiqing), the spiced pears of Daokou Town, and the Zhengzhou Guoguang pears that were successfully grafted in Nanxinzhuang, Xinxiang.

　　The Pest and Disease Hall, the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Hall, the Forestry Hall, the Farm Implement Hall, and the Promotion Department were all rich in content and of great educational significance.

    棉作馆里主要陈列着斯字棉，这是公认的优良棉种。省立农场种的一亩斯字棉收了四百六十斤。该省已普遍播种，棉田达三、二八八、三○八市亩。该省劳动模范最高收获量每亩有收四百斤的。并附有如何达到增产的有关技术的说明。此外还陈列了中原纱厂纺纱过程及其出品的简单模型。
    杂谷馆中陈列有高粱、玉米、大豆、红薯等作物优良品种的标本。谷子有华农四号；高粱有二○○四号、竹秆青；大豆有大黄豆；玉米有华农二号、大红袍；红薯有胜利百号和农林四号。封邱劳动模范种的一棵红薯重十八斤。此外并有沁阳县（怀庆）的特产山药，长一尺余，道口镇的五香梨和在新乡南新庄接种成功的郑州国光梨。
