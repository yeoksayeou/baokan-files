Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 11th: The People's Daily editorial published on the 8th of this month in Beijing, "Welcoming the Patriotic Movement of Catholics," has greatly encouraged Catholics in Chongqing. Shi Mingliang, acting bishop of the Chongqing Catholic Diocese, after reading the People's Daily editorial, called on the more than 30,000 Catholics in the 26 counties under the diocese to more actively participate in the self-reliance and reform movement of Chinese Catholics. Liu Zongyu, chief secretary of the Bishop's Chancery, said: We Catholics in the Chongqing Catholic Diocese will certainly, as the People's Daily editorial said, separate ourselves from the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors and spies, and refuse to accept economic assistance from imperialism, and implement an autonomous, self-supporting, and self-propagating reform movement. He said: The pastoral affairs meeting of the Chongqing Catholic Diocese has been reorganized, and foreign bishops and priests no longer participate in the pastoral affairs meeting. Yu Xueqian (formerly mistakenly written as Yu Xuelian), the priest of the Zengjiayan Catholic Church in the city, said after carefully reading the People's Daily editorial: I am very excited and moved, and it has made me more aware and convinced of the People's Government's religious policy. Yu Xueqian also listed many facts he had personally experienced to show that the People's Government is truly seeking happiness for the people. Chen Guangpu, priest of the Ruose Church, said: We Chongqing Catholics who initiated the reform declaration have discussed and decided that from now on we will refuse foreign priests sent by imperialist countries. If foreign priests formerly in the Chongqing Diocese commit illegal acts that undermine the interests of the Chinese people, we will resolutely assist the People's Government to severely punish them. Liu Renhui, another priest of the Ruose Church, said: Chongqing Catholics have actively participated in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, and have written many letters of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Wang Xiaoci, priest of the Cimu Mountain Seminary in the city, expressed his intention to cut off relations with imperialism through practical actions to actively promote the reform movement. Tang Gongliao, priest of the Baisha Town Catholic Church in Jiangjin County, said: The People's Daily editorial has had a great impact on him, and he will actively participate in and publicize the Catholic reform movement.

　　Up to now, 1,025 Catholics in Chongqing have signed up to participate in the reform movement.

　　重庆天主教徒积极开展革新运动
    【新华社重庆十一日电】本月八日北京人民日报发表的“欢迎天主教人士的爱国运动”的社论，给重庆市天主教徒以极大的鼓励。重庆天主教区代理主教石明亮在读了人民日报的社论后，号召该教区所属二十六县三万余天主教徒更加积极地参加中国天主教徒的自立革新运动。主教公署主任秘书刘宗渔说：我们重庆天主教区的天主教徒一定按照人民日报社论所说的，和帝国主义侵略分子、间谍分子的阴谋活动隔绝，并拒绝接受帝国主义的经济接济，实行自治、自养、自传的革新运动。他说：目前重庆天主教区的教务会议已经改组，外国主教和神父不再参加教务会议。该市曾家岩天主堂司铎余学谦（前误为余学濂）仔细阅读了人民日报社论后说：我很兴奋和感动，使我更加了解和相信了人民政府的宗教政策。余学谦并列举他亲身体验到的许多事实，说明人民政府是真正为人民谋幸福的。若瑟堂司铎陈光普说：我们发起革新宣言的重庆天主教徒已经商讨决定：今后将拒绝帝国主义国家派来的外国神父。原在重庆教区的外国神父若是做出破坏中国人民利益的违法情事，我们一定坚决协助人民政府予以严厉制裁。若瑟堂另一司铎刘仁辉说：重庆天主教徒都积极参加了抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并写了很多慰问信，慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。该市慈母山修院司铎王孝慈表示要以积极推行革新运动的实际行动来割断与帝国主义的关系。江津县白沙镇天主堂司铎唐公聊表示：人民日报的社论对他起了很大的作用，他要积极地参加和宣传天主教的革新运动。
    迄目前为止，重庆市天主教徒签名参加革新运动的已有一千零二十五人。
