　　人民胜利折实公债首次抽签还本付息
    【新华社二十四日讯】一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债第一次兑付本息，已决定于二月一日在北京长安大戏院公开抽签。中央人民政府财政部和中国人民银行总行已会同邀请中华全国总工会及北京市工商联合会筹备委员会推派代表届时出席担任抽签工作，并将请中央人民政府政务院监察委员会、财政经济委员会指定代表到场监督，同时并普遍邀请各机关、团体代表参加，欢迎各界人士到场参观。
    按照公债条例规定，自今年起，每年三月三十一日抽签还本一次；今年应还本金的百分之十。抽签方法系根据债券号码末二字制就签号一百根，分装十筒，每筒抽出一根。凡债券号码末二字与抽出签号相同者，均于此次还本付息。抽中者可持债券向各地人民银行按支付日公债牌价兑付本息。未中签债券亦于同日兑付到期利息。为了从容传达中签号码，便利各地公债持有人到时兑取本息，财政部及中国人民银行总行，决定将本期抽签日期提前六十天。
