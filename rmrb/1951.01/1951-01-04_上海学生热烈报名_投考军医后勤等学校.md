Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. Following their enthusiastic enrollment in military cadre schools, Shanghai youth and students are applying to enroll in military medical and logistics schools. After discussing the significance of joining military medical and logistics schools, many middle school students are willing to apply. They believe that joining military medical and logistics schools is as glorious a task as joining the People's Air Force and People's Navy. Therefore, some students who originally applied to naval and air force schools but were not approved due to age and other conditions are now striving to apply to military medical and other schools. On the first day after receiving the enrollment news for military medical and other schools, more than 120 students from Yucai Middle School applied within just two hours.

　　上海学生热烈报名
    投考军医后勤等学校
    【新华社上海二日电】上海青年学生继热烈报名参加军事干部学校之后，纷纷申请报名参加军医、后勤等学校。许多中等学校的学生在讨论了参加军医、后勤等学校的意义后，都愿意报名投考。他们认为参加军医、后勤等学校和参加人民空军、人民海军是同样光荣的任务。所以，有些原来已报名参加海空军校，但因年龄等条件而没有被批准的学生，这次都争取报名参加军医等学校。育才中学的学生在得到军医等学校招生消息后的头一天，仅两小时内就有一百二十余人报名。格致中学有八十五名原来报名参加军事干部学校因年龄等不合条件的学生，这次又都报名参加军医、后勤等学校。糖业中学许多女学生都兴奋地报名参加医务学校。有许多年龄较小的学生则报名参加报务学校。此外，新建中学、虹口中学等校的学生也纷纷向各该校保送委员会申请报名。
