Xinhua News Agency, January 12th: Although U.S. President Truman, in his message to Congress on the 8th, pleaded with Congress to "unite in this time of emergency," the fierce infighting within the U.S. ruling clique, already on the verge of collapse, has not been calmed in the slightest. Taft, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, following his speeches on the 5th, 6th, and 7th, vehemently attacked the Truman administration's aggressive line on the 9th, demanding that it be replaced by his own aggressive line.

In his speech, Taft opposed the Truman administration's preparations to establish a North Atlantic unified aggressive army with U.S. Army participation and opposed waging aggressive wars on the Eurasian continent. He despairingly admitted that the United States could not win in "large-scale ground warfare," and that building a large number of land armies would lead to the collapse of the U.S. economy. Taft not only fiercely criticized the Truman administration, but also opposed the suggestion of his fellow party member, New York Governor Dewey, to establish 100 divisions of the U.S. military. He criticized this suggestion as a "revenge that would harm oneself." He said, "Dewey's suggestion may mean a military organization of seven million and an army of five million. And this would cause factories in the United States to lose manpower." He feared that "building a large army in Europe would bring inflation because it could mean an annual budget deficit of $25 billion for the United States in the next ten years."

Taft put forward his own line, that is, to use naval and air forces to carry out aggressive wars. He said, "We should concentrate our efforts on strengthening the United States to make it a naval and air power... such a country can dominate the world to the greatest extent possible within the reach of its naval and air forces." Taft here fully revealed the ferocity of his own imperialist self. He solemnly declared that he was "neither an isolationist nor a defeatist," and that he was "not advocating withdrawal from Europe, but simply trying to decide the best way to wage war." Taft made it clear that he was a mortal enemy of the Chinese people. He openly proposed that "we (referring to the U.S. imperialists) should enable Chiang Kai-shek... and his army to wage war against Communist China." But Taft's aggressive plan, just like Truman's aggressive plan, can only have one result: bankruptcy.

### 美统治集团内部争吵无法平息  塔夫脱演说继续猛烈攻击杜鲁门政府

　　美统治集团内部争吵无法平息
    塔夫脱演说继续猛烈攻击杜鲁门政府
    【新华社十二日讯】虽然美国总统杜鲁门在八日向国会提出的咨文中哀求国会要“在这一紧急关头团结起来”，但是，已陷于分崩离析的美国统治集团内的剧烈争吵，却丝毫也不能因此平息下来。共和党政策委员会主席塔夫脱继其五、六、七日的演说之后，又于九日猛烈攻击杜鲁门政府的侵略路线，要求代之以他自己的侵略路线。
    塔夫脱在演说中反对杜鲁门政府准备建立有美国陆军参加的北大西洋统一侵略军，反对在欧亚大陆上进行侵略战争。他绝望地承认：美国不可能在“大规模的地面战争中”获胜，同时，建立大批的陆军却又会使美国的经济崩溃。塔夫脱不仅对杜鲁门政府大事攻讦，而且也反对与他同党的纽约州州长杜威关于建立美军一百个师的建议。他批评这个建议是“欲报仇反而自害”的建议。他说：“杜威的建议可能就是七百万人的军事机构和五百万人的军队。而这就会使美国各工厂失去人力”。他害怕“在欧洲建立庞大的陆军会带来通货膨胀。因为它可能意味着美国在今后十年中每年预算的赤字要达到二百五十亿美元”。
    塔夫脱提出其自己的路线，即以海空军来进行侵略战争。他说：“我们应该集中力量增强美国使之成为海空军国家……这样的国家能够在海空军所能及的范围以内在尽可能大的范围内支配世界。”塔夫脱在这里完全表明了他自己的帝国主义者的凶相。他郑重声明他“既不是一个孤立主义者，也不是一个失败主义者”，他“并不主张退出欧洲，而只是试图决定一个进行战争的最好的方法”。塔夫脱表明了他是中国人民的死敌。他公然提出：“我们（指美帝国主义者）应该使蒋介石……和他的军队可以对共产党中国进行战争”。但是塔夫脱的侵略计划也正如杜鲁门的侵略计划一样，只能有一个结果，那就是破产。
