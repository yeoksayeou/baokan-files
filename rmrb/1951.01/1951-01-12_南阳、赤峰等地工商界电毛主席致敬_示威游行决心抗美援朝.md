　　Nanyang, Chifeng and Other Industrial and Commercial Circles Send Telegrams to Chairman Mao to Express Respect
    Demonstrations and Marches Show Determination to Resist America and Aid Korea
    [This newspaper dispatch] The industrial and commercial circles of Nanyang City in Henan Province, Chifeng City in Rehe Province, and other places, held demonstrations and marches to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country around the New Year, and sent telegrams to Chairman Mao to express their respect.
    The telegram from the industrial and commercial circles of Nanyang City, Henan Province, to Chairman Mao stated: "At a time when the people of the whole country are launching a movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, the industrial and commercial circles of Nanyang City are actively participating in current affairs studies, formulating patriotic pacts, and holding demonstrations and marches. We resolutely guarantee that, according to the direction you have indicated, we will step up production, enthusiastically pay taxes, and fully support the sacred struggle to resist America and aid Korea. Moreover, we believe that victory is inevitable."
    Wang Shirong, Director of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of Chifeng City, Rehe Province, and Deputy Director Yu Zhenhe stated in their telegram to Chairman Mao: "The acts of aggression by American imperialism in Korea, its invasion of our country's Taiwan, and its intrusions into our Northeast airspace have long aroused the resentment of the entire industrial and commercial community of Chifeng City. Over the past two months, we have participated in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country with practical actions. On December 2, 1950, at a meeting of 1,200 industrialists and businessmen in the city, the Chifeng City Industrial and Commercial Circles' Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend Our Country was formed, and all unanimously swore to resolutely abide by the four patriotic pacts. Subsequently, we completed and exceeded the task of purchasing the second phase of Northeast Patriotic Bonds on schedule, and paid the taxes for the fourth quarter of 1950 as scheduled. As the New Year approached, in order to extend our regards to the Chinese People's Volunteers, the industrial and commercial circles of Chifeng City donated 18.73 million yuan in comfort funds and 161 comfort bags within two days, and wrote 183 letters of appreciation.
    When we saw your reply to the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles in early December of last year, we were very excited and immediately printed and distributed this document for study in the city's industrial and commercial circles, and convened a forum of representatives from the industrial and commercial circles. Everyone unanimously expressed: We resolutely respond to your call, firmly stand on the position of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, unite with people from all walks of life, and form a united front against imperialism that is even more solid than in the past, and work together to complete the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country to the very end."
    The telegram from the industrial and commercial circles of Beipiao County to Chairman Mao stated: "Under your wise leadership, we are moving towards a path of development and prosperity. The hateful beastly American imperialism has invaded our country's Taiwan, bombed our country's territory, and invaded our neighboring country Korea. This reckless and mad act has aroused our infinite indignation. Today, more than a thousand people from the industrial and commercial circles of Beipiao held a demonstration and march to resist America and aid Korea, and jointly signed six covenants, and unanimously swore at the meeting that we guarantee the thorough implementation of the patriotic covenants, and will forever unite with the people from all walks of life across the country and fight to the end for the final victory in the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country."

    示威游行决心抗美援朝
    【本报讯】河南南阳市、热河赤峰市等地工商业界，于新年前后分别举行了抗美援朝保家卫国示威游行，并电毛主席致敬。
    河南省南阳市工商业界致毛主席电称：“在全国人民掀起抗美援朝保家卫国运动的时候，我们南阳市工商界积极参加时事学习，订立了爱国公约，并举行了示威游行。我们坚决保证根据您指示的方向，加紧生产，踊跃纳税，全力支持抗美援朝的神圣斗争，而且，相信胜利是必然的。”
    热河省赤峰市工商联合会主任王世荣、副主任于振河致毛主席电称：“美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和侵略我国台湾、侵袭我东北领空的暴行，早已引起了我赤峰市全体工商业界的愤恨。两月来，我们以实际行动参加了抗美援朝保家卫国运动。一九五零年十二月二日，在全市工商业者一千二百人的大会上，组成了赤峰市工商业界抗美援朝保家卫国运动委员会，全体一致宣誓坚决遵行四项爱国公约。随后，我们按期完成并超过了购买东北第二期爱国公债的任务，如期缴纳了一九五零年第四季度的税收。新年来临之际，为了慰问中国人民志愿军，两天之内，赤峰市工商业界捐献了慰问款一千八百七十三万元，慰问袋一百六十一个，并写好慰问信一百八十三封。
    当去年十二月初我们看到您给天津市工商业界的复电时，感到非常兴奋，立即印发了这一文件，在全市工商业界进行学习，而且召开了工商业界代表座谈会。大家一致表示：坚决响应您的号召，坚定地站在抗美援朝保家卫国立场上，和各阶层人民团结一致，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义的统一战线，共同为完成抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗到底。”
    北票县工商业界游行示威大会致毛主席电称：“我们在您的英明领导下，正走向发展繁荣的道路，可恨的野兽美帝竟侵占我国台湾，轰炸我国领土，并侵略我国邻邦朝鲜，这种胆大妄为的疯狂行动，激起我们无限的愤恨。今天，我们北票工商业界千余人举行抗美援朝示威游行，共同签订了六项公约，并在大会上一致宣誓，我们保证爱国公约彻底执行，永远和全国各界人民大众团结一道，为抗美援朝保家卫国斗争的最后胜利而奋斗到底。”
