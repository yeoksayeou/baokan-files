Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd. Water conservancy winter projects in various parts of Central and South China began one after another in November of last year. In the regions along rivers, lakes and reservoirs, the winter projects in the whole area mainly focus on embankment repairs. In general areas, small-scale irrigation and drainage projects are being widely built to prevent water and drought disasters this year. As of now, except for Henan Province, which has completed the Yellow River embankment restoration project and is carrying out the fundamental treatment project in the upper reaches of the Huai River, the embankment repair projects in various dikes and polders in Hunan Province, the Changde Doushan irrigation project, and the more than 300,000 pond and dam projects that the province will build this spring, and Jiangxi Province's Fu Dayou embankment on the east bank of the Gan River to protect Nanchang City, the Anfu Canal, the Wan'an Canal and other irrigation projects were all started in November last year. Jiangxi Province is also preparing to focus on repairing more than 18 million cubic meters of earthwork for the embankments near Poyang Lake on the Gan, Fu, Rao, Xin, and Xiu rivers this spring. In the Jianghan Plain area of Hubei Province, the Jingjiang Dam is the focus of annual repairs, and preparations for construction are currently underway. In addition, the province plans to repair a total of 22 million cubic meters of earthwork for the East Jing River embankment and civilian embankments this spring, and partial construction began at the end of November last year. The Beijiang Lubaobao Sluice flood control project in Guangdong Province has been assisted by personnel sent by the Water Conservancy Department of the Central and South Military and Political Committee for surveying and construction.

When leading farmers in winter repairs, the people's governments at all levels in the region have appropriately paid attention to combining winter water conservancy work with local land reform or rent reduction movements. For example, in Yuanjiang County, Hunan, villages near the lake that are easily threatened by floods first rushed to complete the embankment repairs and then carried out land reform, while other townships first carried out land reform. All localities have also paid great attention to the organization and leadership of civilian workers in winter repairs. Counties in Hunan Province that are carrying out winter water conservancy have generally organized dike repair committees or pond and dam construction committees from the county to the township level to solve some specific problems in winter repair work. In addition, all localities have specifically stipulated reasonable burden principles for dike repair based on labor input and grain output based on benefited fields, making the enthusiasm of civilian workers for dike repair more positive.

　　恢复战前农业生产水平加紧水利冬修工程
    中南水利冬修工程先后动工
    【新华社汉口三日电】中南各地的水利冬修工程已于去年十一月内先后动工。全区沿江、河、湖泊地区的冬修工程以培修堤防为主。一般地区则普遍兴修小型灌溉和排水工程，以防止今年的水、旱灾荒。截至目前为止，全区除河南省已完成黄河复堤工程和正在进行淮河上游的根治工程外，湖南省各堤垸的培修工程、常德陡山灌溉工程与该省在今春兴修的三十多万口塘坝工程，江西省赣江东岸保护南昌市的富大有圩堤、安福渠、万安渠等灌溉工程，均在去年十一月内先后动工。江西省并准备在今春重点培修赣、抚、饶、信、修各河近鄱阳湖的堤防一千八百多万土方。湖北省江、汉平原地区以荆江大堤为岁修重点，目前正在进行施工的准备工作。此外，该省拟在今春培修东荆河堤防及民堤土方共二千二百万公方，去年十一月底已部分开工。广东省的北江芦苞闸拦洪工程，已由中南军政委员会水利部派员前往协助勘察和修建。
    全区各地人民政府在领导农民冬修时，均适当地注意了使冬修水利工作与当地的土地改革或减租运动结合进行。如湖南沅江县靠湖近易受洪水威胁的乡村，农民首先突击修完堤，然后进行土地改革，其余各乡则首先进行土地改革。各地在冬修中对民工的组织领导工作也很注意，湖南省进行水利冬修的各县由县到乡均普遍组织了修堤委员会或修建塘坝委员会，以解决冬修工作中的若干具体问题。此外，各地并具体规定了按劳动力出人修堤和按受益田亩出粮的合理负担原则，使民工的修堤情绪更加积极。
