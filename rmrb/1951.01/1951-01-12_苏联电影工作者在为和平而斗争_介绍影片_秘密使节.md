Soviet Film Workers Fight for Peace
    ——Introducing the Film "Secret Mission"
　　M· Luómǔ
    Editor's Note: The author of this article is the director of the film "Secret Mission." The film is scheduled to premiere in Beijing and other locations on the 12th of this month.
    For the happiness and peace of every nation, the world is engaged in a great struggle against the new warmongers. Every person with a sense of justice, no matter which country they live in, whether they are workers, farmers, scholars, or artists, should declare their position to those around them: Do they stand with those who incite the flames of a new war, or do they stand with those who live and work for the future happiness and peace of mankind? We Soviet film workers are no exception. Each of us should answer: How do we fight for the cause of peace?
    The film "Secret Mission," which our film industry has just completed, is a powerful answer to this question, and a contribution to the cause of peace that we have done our best to make. The film exposes the despicable and terrible intentions of the new warmongers.
    The content of the film's story is true; we only allowed ourselves to write dialogue and make interpolations of the story's characters. The events depicted in the film really happened, and it tells the world what is currently happening.
    What kind of events are these?
    The sound of the Great Patriotic War has not yet stopped, blood is still flowing on the battlefield, and the workers of Russia, America, and Britain in military uniforms are still dying, hoping to exchange their lives for lasting peace for mankind, hoping to use their own blood as the price for the happiness of their descendants. While these people were still engaged in a sharp struggle against German fascism, behind their backs, the ugly profiteers of Wall Street and the City of London and their accomplices—the diplomats and military advisors—had already begun to make various preparations for a new war.
    In late 1944 and early 1945, with the tacit consent of British and American politicians, secret diplomatic envoys from Britain and America came to Germany one after another. Some were disguised as representatives of the Red Cross, some as Portuguese travelers or journalists, and some simply revealed their true faces. These representatives of American capitalist reactionaries and the leaders of German military and industrial circles conducted secret consultations at Krupp's in Essen. At this meeting, Germans and Americans sat closely together, discussing how to preserve the foundation of German military industry, transfer German military monopolies to the United States, and cut off the supply of materials from the United States to the Soviet Union. The American special envoys also negotiated with Himmler on how to implement a secret surrender in the West, so that the existing forces of the German army could be turned to the East to deal with the Soviet Union, while allowing the British and American armies to have the opportunity to occupy the whole of Germany. The ultimate goal of these consultations was only one: to turn Germany into a base for a new war, to preserve its military industry and military institutions, and to retain fascist administrative cadres, so that Germany would become a reactionary fortress in Europe. This was a shameless act committed while British and American political leaders were swearing to the Soviet Union to maintain friendly relations faithfully and permanently. This series of negotiations that bet the fate of mankind is the central story of the film "Secret Mission."
    The more we filmmakers studied the real materials and documents, the clearer the ugly and terrible scene of betrayal became.
    The roles in the film are various types of criminals, although none of them has the appearance of a thief or a robber. Appearing before the audience are well-dressed, polite civil and military gentlemen, but hidden beneath their politeness are the true faces of ugly businessmen, spies, and executioners.
    Some of the actors participating in this film are unfamiliar to the audience.
    The Soviet Union has many actors, so we can build a strong cast, some of whom are participating in film shooting for the first time. Organizing this lineup was very difficult, because there are many important scenes and roles in the film. From the cunning Churchill and his staff, to the leader of the secret mission, the senator—a flattering, shameless, and self-confident plunderer. With them is an eternal shadow-like, gray, inconspicuous person. He has a kind attitude, a flattering voice, as if he can't see or hear anything, but he sees everything and remembers everything. This is the intelligence officer of the Strategic Intelligence Agency. He came here to buy over the saboteurs and spies of Germany in the Balkans at the moment when the fascist military apparatus collapsed. As is well known, the United States really bought over Germany's network of saboteurs and spies, with the aim of sending them to deal with the Soviet Union.
    They met with the leaders of the fascist German government, and a large group of ugly fascist politicians headed by Hitler appeared before the audience: like the executioner Geikin Bronnell—a two-meter-tall, muscular fellow, who is well known. On his desk was a lamp with a lampshade made of human skin, which was changed every month; Hitler's right hand—the cunning Bormann, nicknamed the "Brown Bishop," with the face of a butcher and the heart of a Jew; the feminine Himmler, with small hands, who was outwardly slow and gentle, but extremely vicious to his opponents; Schellenberg, the leader of Germany's foreign spy network, who was like a famous lawyer handling divorce cases, doing the dirtiest and ugliest things with a quiet smile. There were also Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach—the uncrowned kings of Germany, whom Hitler had to stand up to receive; and a large group of death merchants—German military industrialists and German big capitalists—such as Hjalmar Schacht, Schmitt, Pfühl, Mengus, Kwandt, Reckeberg... etc. (Reckeberg is famous because as early as after the First World War in 1914, he suggested that Germany be turned into a colony of Britain or the United States.)
    These are all murderers in white hard-sleeved shirts, murderers in dress coats or generals' uniforms, wearing medals. At the same time, a series of murderers, saboteurs, and spies appear before the audience, all of whom were sent to the people's democratic countries by their new masters—the Americans. In contrast to this dark world are two Soviet people: the intelligence officer Maria Glukhova, who, under the pseudonym Martha Schirlke, served as a staff member of Schellenberg and infiltrated the core of the conspiracy. And her friend, the Soviet intelligence officer Demidiev. Their lives are in danger every minute. These two Soviet people finally exposed the conspirators' intentions and faithfully fulfilled their responsibilities to their country. And Glukhova finally sacrificed gloriously. The content of the film "Secret Mission" is like this.
    I made this film in collaboration with cinematographer Wolczek, with whom I have worked in the film industry for twenty years.
    The music in the film is the work of the famous Soviet composer Khachaturian, who was able to convey the dark colors of the conspiracy with extremely profound expressiveness in the instruments.
    It was extremely difficult for the director, cinematographer, painter, and actors who made this film to avoid giving a false impression, to avoid excessive acting, and to portray these scoundrels realistically. Not only that, but it must also be so real that the audience feels that they are not actors, but real people, who do not think they are evil. In their own eyes, the bad things they do, as long as they can bring money or protect themselves, are not considered bad things.
    In order to accurately reflect reality, the actors must make an effort, not only to study the materials, but also to study the psychology of the representatives of the capitalist world, because in the eyes of a Soviet person (including the actors who were educated in a socialist environment), many of the behaviors and facts of the characters in the film seem impossible in real life. The most difficult was the actor Pertsovsky, who played the role of the Gestapo leader—the executioner Geikin Bronnell. Bertsovsky honed his skills for a whole week in order to play a brutal thug like the Gestapo leader.
    My entire mission in shooting this film was to obey one task, that is, to make every scene a document exposing evil, and I demanded that all actors, photographers, and especially myself, do so.
    All our actors worked on this film with great enthusiasm, and we would be very happy if our achievements made even a small contribution to the victory of the cause of world peace.

### 苏联电影工作者在为和平而斗争——介绍影片“秘密使节”

　　苏联电影工作者在为和平而斗争
    ——介绍影片“秘密使节”
　　Ｍ·罗姆
    编者按：本文作者是“秘密使节”影片的导演。该片定于本月十二日开始在北京及各地公演。
    为了每个民族的幸福与和平，全世界正在进行着反对新战争贩子的伟大斗争。每一个有正义感的人，不论他住在那一个国家，不论他是工人、农民、学者或是艺术工作者，都应该向他周围的人表明他的立场：他是和那些煽动新战争火焰的人站在一起呢，还是和那些为着人类未来的幸福与和平而生活着、劳动着的人们站在一起？我们苏联电影工作者，也不能例外。我们每一个人都应该回答：他怎样在为和平事业而斗争。
    我们电影界刚刚完成的一部影片“秘密使节”，是对这个问题的一个有力的答复，是我们竭尽全力做出来的对和平事业的贡献。影片揭穿了新战争贩子们的卑鄙和可怕的企图。
    影片故事的内容是真实的，我们仅仅允许自己写出对白，做出故事人物的穿插而已。影片所影射的事件是真的发生了，而它也告诉全世界目前正在发生些什么。
    这究竟是怎样的事件呢？
    伟大的卫国战争的炮声还没停止，战场上还在流血，俄罗斯、美国、英国的穿着军装的劳动者们还在死亡着，他们希望用他们的生命来换取人类的持久和平，他们希望以他们自己的鲜血作为他们下代幸福的代价。这些人还在对德国法西斯作着尖锐的斗争时，在他们的背后，那批发着战争财的华尔街和伦敦城区的丑恶的事业家们及其帮凶——那批外交官和军事顾问们，已开始为着新的战争作出各种准备了。
    一九四四年末和一九四五年初，在英美大政客们的默许下，英美的秘密外交使者，一批跟一批地来到德国。他们有的乔装红十字会代表，有的乔装葡萄牙的旅行家或新闻记者，有的就索性暴露出自己本来的面目。这些美国资本主义反动派的代表们和德国军事、工业界的领导人，在埃森城克虏伯处进行了秘密的协商，在这个会议上，德国人和美国人紧紧地靠在一起地坐着，他们讨论了如何保存德国军事工业基础，把德国军事专卖权转交美国，以及美国断绝对苏联物资供应等问题。美国的特使们并且和希姆莱谈判了怎样在西方实行秘密投降，使德军现存的力量转向东方来对付苏联，同时使英美军队有占领德国全部的机会。这些协商的最后目的只有一个，那就是把德国变成新战争的根据地，保存它的军事工业和军事机构，保留法西斯的行政干部，使德国成为欧洲的反动堡垒。这是正当英美政治领袖们向苏联发誓要忠实地、永久不渝地保持友好的时候所干下的无耻勾当。这一连串把人类命运作为赌注的谈判，就是影片“秘密使节”的故事中心。
    我们电影工作者，越研究真实的资料和文件，丑恶的可怕的背叛的景象，也就越显得清楚了。
    影片的角色是各种类型的罪犯，虽然其中没有一个具有贼或者强盗的外形。在观众面前出现的是穿戴得很讲究的、有礼貌的文官和军界的先生们，但在他们的礼貌下面，却暗藏着丑恶的事业家、间谍和刽子手的真面目。
    参加这部影片的演员们，有些是观众过去不熟识的。
    苏联有很多的演员，所以我们可以建立一个强大的演员阵容，其中一部分是初次参加拍摄电影的。组织这个阵容是很艰难的，因为影片中有许多重要的场面和角色。从狡猾的邱吉尔和他的参谋起，到秘密使团的领导人参议员——欺下媚上的、无耻的、自信的掠夺者。和他们在一起的是一个永恒的影子似的、灰色的、不令人注目的人。他有和蔼的态度，谄媚的声音，好像什么都看不见、听不到似的，但是他却什么都看得见，记得住的。这就是战略情报局的侦察员。他来到这里的目的是在法西斯军事机构垮台的一刹那，把德国在巴尔干的破坏者和间谍收买过来。众所周知，美国真的把德国的破坏者和间谍网收买了，其目的是派他们去对付苏联。
    他们和法西斯德国政府领导人接头，在观众面前出现了一大批以希特勒为首的丑恶的法西斯政治家们：像刽子手盖金布隆涅尔——两米高的、筋肉发达的家伙，他是大家所熟知的。在他的书桌上摆着一个灯，灯罩是人皮作的，每月换一次；希特勒的右手——狡猾的鲍尔曼，外号叫“棕色主教”，有着屠夫的脸，犹太的心；女性型的、有一双小手的希姆莱，他外表迟缓、和蔼，但对他的敌对者却毒辣异常；德国的国外间谍网领导人舍林别尔格，他像一个办离婚案的名律师，带着安静的微笑去作最肮脏最丑恶的事情。还有克虏伯·风、波连、翁德加尔巴赫——德国的无冕之王，希特勒接见他都得站起来；还有一大批死亡贩子——德国的军事工业家和德国大资本家——如雅勒玛尔沙赫特、史米特、普非尔德梦戈斯、克万特、雷赫贝尔格……等。（雷赫贝尔格之所以著名，是由于远在一九一四年第一次大战后，他曾建议过把德国变成英国或者美国的殖民地。）
    这都是穿着白硬袖衣服的杀人犯，穿大礼服或上将服、佩带勋章的杀人犯。在观众面前同时还出现着一连串的杀人犯，破坏者和间谍，这些人都是由他们的新主人——美国人派到人民民主国家来的。和这个黑暗世界相对比的是两个苏联人：侦察员玛丽亚·格鲁赫娃，她化名玛尔达·史尔克，充当舍林别尔格的工作人员，潜入阴谋的核心。还有她的朋友，苏联侦察员杰米吉也夫。他们俩每分钟都有性命的危险。这两个苏联人，终于揭露了阴谋者的企图，忠实地对祖国尽了自己的责任。而格鲁赫娃终于光荣的牺牲了。影片“秘密使节”的内容就是如此。
    我摄制这部片子，是和摄影师沃尔切克一同工作的，我们已在电影界一同工作过二十年了。
    影片中的音乐是苏联名作曲家哈洽都良的作品、他能用极深刻的表现力在乐器中传达了阴谋的黑暗色彩。
    作这部影片的导演，摄影师，画家和演员，都是极不容易的，要避免给人虚伪的印象，要避免过火的演技，要把这些败类演的逼真。不但如此，而且要真实到使观众感觉到不是演员，而是真人，这些人不以为自己是恶人。他们所作的坏事、在他们自己看来，只要能带来金钱或者能保护自己，那就不算什么坏事了。
    为了真确地反映现实，演员们就必需作一番努力，他们不仅要研究资料，同时也要研究资本主义世界代表人物的心理，因为在一个苏联人（连在社会主义环境中受教育的演员们也在内）看来，影片中角色的许多行为和事实，在现实生活中发生好像是不可能的。最困难的是演员裴尔措夫斯基，他扮演盖世太保的领导人——刽子手盖金布隆涅尔的角色。别尔曹夫斯基磨练了整整一星期，为了扮演像盖世太保领导人这样残酷的暴徒。
    拍摄这部影片，我整个的使命是服从一个任务，那就是让每一场戏都变成一个揭穿罪恶的文件，我要求全体演员，摄影师，尤其是我自己，都这样做。
    我们所有的演员都以极大的热诚为这部片子工作着，假若我们的劳绩，在世界和平事业的胜利中有一点贡献，那我们就很幸福了。
