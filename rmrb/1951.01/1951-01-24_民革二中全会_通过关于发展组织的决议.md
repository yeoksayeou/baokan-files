　　The RCCK Second Plenary Session
    Adopts Resolution on Developing the Organization
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Second Plenary Session of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) passed the "Resolution on Developing the Organization" on December 4th of last year. The full text is as follows:

    The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is a member of the people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The thought of New Democracy is the guiding ideology of our party; the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the program of action for our party. Every comrade should have a clear understanding in thought and put it into practice with concrete actions. In order to inherit Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary tradition and shoulder this historical revolutionary task, we must strengthen our organization and develop our party membership under the general requirement of consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front. We must also clearly stipulate that, according to the distinction of "three levels and two categories," the good middle-level elements of the old Kuomintang should be the main target for development.

    In the past year, because we lacked a unified and clear understanding of the above-mentioned development guidelines, and because of objective difficulties and insufficient subjective efforts, our organizational work inevitably experienced either left or right deviations at times. In the previous period, our focus on rectifying the organization and establishing a backbone was correct and achieved certain results. However, the failure to specifically plan how to develop the already rectified organization was a shortcoming. In the later period, we only emphasized the necessity of increasing the number of party members, without grasping the center of development and without handling it separately according to the specific conditions of various regions. As a result, "developing the middle level" was just an empty slogan, "establishing a backbone" lacked a certain mass foundation, and the task of adapting to the actual requirements of the people's democratic united front was naturally difficult to accomplish satisfactorily.

    We believe that: From now on, we should determine to take the democratic elements of the old Kuomintang middle level as the main target for recruitment. In areas where rectification has not been completed, we should continue to complete the rectification work. In areas where rectification has been completed, we should develop in a planned and step-by-step manner and regularly supervise and inspect the organizational development work in various regions. We should pay special attention to the following when developing our organization:

    1. Actively and vigorously strive for the in-service personnel of the People's Government organs who participated in the old Kuomintang organization in the past and who have shown good performance in work and study.

    2. The general old Kuomintang party members who have been tested in the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland" movement or the land reform work, and who have shown good performance, are also targets we actively strive for.

### 民革二中全会  通过关于发展组织的决议

　　民革二中全会
    通过关于发展组织的决议
    【本报讯】民革二中全会于去年十二月四日通过“关于发展组织的决议案”全文如下：
    中国国民党革命委员会是中国共产党领导下的人民民主统一战线成员之一。新民主主义的思想，就是本党的领导思想；人民政协共同纲领，就是本党的行动纲领。每个同志都应在思想上有明确认识，并以实际行动去贯彻执行。为了继承孙中山先生的革命传统和肩负这一历史的革命任务，我们必须在巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线的总要求之下，加强组织，发展党员；并须明确规定依照“三层两类”之区分，以旧国民党好的中层分子为主要的发展对象。
    过去一年来，由于我们对上述发展方针没有统一的明确认识，由于客观的困难和主观的努力不够，因此，我们的组织工作，有时不免发生或左或右的偏向。在前一时期，我们着重整理组织和建立骨干，是正确的，并获得一定的成绩，但对已经过整理的组织，未具体计划如何发展，则是缺点；在后一时期，又只强调党员数量之必须增加，而没有抓住发展的中心，和没有依照各地的具体情况，加以分别处理。其结果，“发展中层”只是一个空洞的口号，“建立骨干”亦缺乏一定的群众基础，而适应人民民主统一战线的实际要求的任务，自然也就难以圆满达成了。
    我们认为：今后应确定以旧国民党中层的民主分子为主要吸收对象，在整理未竟的地区，继续完成整理工作；在整理已经完成的地区，则应有计划有步骤的发展，并经常督促及检查各地组织发展工作。我们发展组织，应该特别注意下列诸项：
    一、人民政府机关的在职人员，过去曾参加过旧国民党组织，而现时在工作和学习中有良好成绩表现者，应积极的大力争取。
    二、一般的旧国民党党员，在“抗美援朝保家卫国”运动中或土地改革工作中，经过考验，而有良好成绩表现者，亦为我们积极争取的对象。
