A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force held a grand evening party on December 25, 1950, to welcome the first group of patriotic youth joining the People's Air Force. At the meeting, the commander first gave a welcoming speech, pointing out the important role of young intellectuals in future national defense construction, and called on everyone to carry forward the glorious tradition of Chinese youth, give full play to their talents in learning, and improve on the existing level of culture and science. Then the chief of staff and the director of the political department both spoke. Liu Chengyou and Wang Lin delivered speeches on behalf of the new students, expressing that they would definitely respond to the call of the leaders, concentrate on learning, and guarantee the resolute completion of the sacred task of defending the motherland's airspace. After introducing the vigorous participation in the military academy movement in the school, they said: "Many students, after signing up, were obstructed by their families and lovers, but they used various methods to persuade them and realized their wishes. Today, we have been welcomed by all the leaders and comrades, and such a grand meeting has been held. We will never disappoint the enthusiasm of the comrades." Unable to resist the enthusiastic encouragement, three or four new students spontaneously ran to the stage to speak. Liu Shouyi said: "Today is the first time I have experienced that the comradeship in the revolutionary army is so great. As soon as we got off the bus, leaders and comrades at all levels came to greet us, and the dormitories were painted white. Many comrades live with us and care about us. My joy is indescribable. I have nothing else to repay, so I can only ask the leaders and comrades to look at my future study results and strive to be an excellent air force soldier!" Wang Ruisheng read out his letter of determination on the stage: "To defend the motherland, I will fight to the end..."

The conference proceeded in an atmosphere of unity and enthusiasm. Songs and slogans rose one after another. The cultural troupe rushed to compose new songs to welcome the new students. Finally, the film "Sons and Daughters of China" was shown.

    大会始终在团结、热烈的气氛中进行。歌声口号，此起彼落。文工团为了欢迎新学员，赶编了新歌。最后并放映影片《中华儿女》。
