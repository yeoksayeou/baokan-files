　　Hebei Anguo Labor Model Wang Zhihe Leads the Masses in Accumulating Fertilizer
Editor:
    I have two things to report to you:
    (1) The method I used to accumulate fertilizer last winter was to first prepare the bedding soil, and then pile up all the year's wheat roots and the leaves and ash soil collected last winter, etc., and pad the pigsty every day or two. In this way, because pigs and sheep urinate on it, this ash soil becomes very good fertilizer. Now my family has accumulated 300 cartloads of fertilizer. Not only am I doing this, but the households in the mutual aid groups I lead and the masses in the whole village have also launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign, all saying that they will be able to apply about 40 cartloads of topdressing per mu of land this spring.
    (2) We are a disaster area here, and the lives of the people are difficult, so we have organized a pottery kiln, two brick kilns, and a flower tying factory. In addition, we are making waterwheels, farm tools, etc. In this way, we have helped more than a hundred disaster victims to overcome the disaster.
        Sincerely,
                         Labor Model Wang Zhihe, Liujiazhuang Village, Anguo County, Hebei Province

　　河北安国劳动模范王志合领导群众积肥编辑同志：
    我有两件事向你们报告：
    （一）我去冬积肥的方法，是首先把垫圈土准备好，又将全年的麦根及去冬收集来的树叶和灰土等堆在一起，每隔一两天垫一次圈，这样因有猪踩羊尿，这些灰土便成为很好的肥料。现在我家已积肥三百车。不但我一个人如此，就是连我领导的几个互助组内各户和全村的群众也开展了积肥运动，都说到今春播种时，一定能达到每亩地使追肥四十车左右。
    （二）我们这里是一灾区，老百姓们生活困难，所以组织起了一个盆窑、两个砖窑及一个扎花厂。此外打水车、农具等等。这样，已带动了百余灾民，度过了灾荒。
        此致敬礼
                         河北省安国县刘家庄村劳动模范  王志合
