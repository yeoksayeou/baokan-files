    The Handling and Self-Criticism of the Suspected Assault Case of Yang Fu by the Dingxing County People's Court

    To the Editor:

    We have seen the letter from Yang Zuoran, published on page three of the People's Daily on December 11, 1950, in which he complained that his father, Yang Fu, had been detained for half a year on suspicion of assault.

    Yang Fu is a suspect in the case of Zhang Yongtang (a demobilized soldier) being attacked with an axe by thugs. The investigation, interrogation, and handling of this case are detailed below:

    I. Background of the Plaintiff and Defendant:

    Plaintiff Zhang Yongtang, 29 years old, has been a farmer since childhood. In July 1938, he joined the Special Forces Company of the 26th Regiment of the First Military Sub-district as a soldier. After two years, he was transferred to the reconnaissance company as an armed squad leader. Later, he returned home to farm due to illness.

    Defendant Liang Yuhe, 32 years old, has run a grocery store at home since childhood. After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the troops of traitor Zhao Yukun and returned home to trade after four years. From the surrender of the Japanese invaders until the liberation of the county, he served as a puppet Bao trưởng (chief of a village).

    Defendant Yang Fu, 52 years old, has been a farmer since childhood. In 1917, he went to work in the Nanguan coal mine in Tianjin but returned home in less than a year and served as a "local" in the village. In 1948, he worked with Liang Yuhe in the puppet Bao trưởng office.

    II. Details of the Incident:

    Because the house of Zhang Yongtang collapsed due to rain, he went to Yang Xingzhou's (the village chief's) house every day to find lodging. On June 13th last year, Zhang Yongtang was sleeping on the roof. At 11 o'clock, two people came to his head. One person held down his head, and the other used an axe to chop him. Zhang Yongtang suffered three cuts to the top of his head and one cut to his hand. Zhang Yongtang struggled and sat up, and the two men ran away. According to Zhang, the perpetrators were Liang Yuhe and Yang Fu: Yang Fu held his head, and Liang Yuhe chopped. After being chopped, Zhang shouted loudly. Village security officers Zhang Yingui and Zhang Yongwen went to chase the perpetrators but failed to catch them. Zhang Yongwen (Zhang Yongtang's elder brother) immediately reported to the district. At dawn, district cadres Zu Zemin, Ma Shoushan, and Tian Enbo, along with several militiamen from Yang Village, went to the village to investigate. They immediately arrested Liang and Yang and sent them to the county.

    III. Interrogation and Investigation:

    After the county accepted the case, Liang Yuhe admitted during interrogation that he had a feud with Zhang and that he was the one who chopped him, but he did not mention Yang Fu. Yang Fu also did not admit to being involved. However, the plaintiff repeatedly stated that it was Yang Fu and Liang Yuhe who committed the crime.

    IV. Handling Results:

    Based on this situation, we handled the two individuals differently. Liang Yuhe's assault was verified. Additionally, this criminal also had a murder case when he was a puppet soldier. He will be sentenced after a thorough investigation. Because Yang Fu's involvement in the chopping could not be confirmed, he was released on bail in early December of last year.

    V. Discrepancies between Yang Zuoran's Letter of Criticism and the Facts:

    1.  Yang claimed that his father went to the fields to pull wheat on the night of the incident on June 13th (at 10 o'clock). Our investigation revealed that Yang Fu did not pull wheat at that time.

    2.  Yang claimed that the village government was unaware when the district cadres sent his father and Liang Yuhe to the county. Our investigation revealed that the village cadres were aware of the matter.

    3.  Yang claimed that the village cadres had mediated, asking his family to give ten dan (石) of wheat to the chopped victim. Our investigation revealed that the village cadres did not mediate.

    4.  Yang claimed that the chopped victim lived in a deep mansion. After sending personnel to survey, the yard was not a deep mansion, and the roof could be accessed directly from the back.

    5.  Yang's statement about Director Wang's conversation also does not match the facts.

    VI. Self-Criticism on the Handling of This Case:

    According to our analysis, Yang Fu is highly suspected, but it cannot be verified. We also did not handle it promptly. In November, the focus was placed on cleaning up counter-revolutionary cases, and this case was delayed. We have already made a self-criticism on this point.

                                       Dingxing County People's Court

    Editor's Note: Yang Zuoran's letter was published on page three of this newspaper on December 11, 1950. The Dingxing County People's Court delayed the case of Yang Zuoran's father, who was suspected of assault, for a long time. It has now been handled. The court's letter mentions that Yang Zuoran's reflection on his father's lawsuit does not match the facts in certain places. However, the main situation—the situation of being imprisoned for about half a year on suspicion of assault—we believe is consistent with the facts. The meaning of publishing Yang Zuoran's letter is to illustrate that the Dingxing Court should quickly handle this case: if guilty, he should be sentenced; if innocent, he should be released. As for certain specific situations reflected by Yang Zuoran that do not match the facts, this is also inappropriate. When writing for newspapers and reflecting on issues, we must be truthful and responsible for the facts.

### 定兴县人民法院对杨福行凶  嫌疑案处理经过及检讨

1951-01-18
第2版()
专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

    定兴县人民法院对杨福行凶 
    嫌疑案处理经过及检讨编辑同志：
    一九五○年十二月十一日人民日报第三版所刊杨作然申诉他父亲杨福因打人嫌疑被扣半年的来信看到了。
    杨福是张永堂（退伍军人）被暴徒用斧砍伤一案的嫌疑犯，兹将该案的调查审讯和处理情况分述如下：
    一、原告及被告的出身历史：
    原告张永堂，现年二十九岁，从小在家为农。一九三八年七月，他参加一分区二十六团特务连当战士，二年余后调侦察连当武装组长。后因病回家为农。
    被告梁玉和，现年三十二岁，从小在家开杂货铺。抗日战争开始后，他参加赵逆玉昆部当兵，四年后回家作买卖。自日寇投降起到本县解放时止，他当了伪保长。
    被告杨福，现年五十二岁，从小在家为农。民国六年去天津南关煤窑作工，不满一年又回家，在村里当“地方”。一九四八年和梁玉和在一起在伪保公所办事。
    二、此案发生经过：
    张永堂因家中房子下雨倒了，故每天到杨兴洲（村长）家去找宿。去年六月十三日那天，张永堂在房上睡觉。十一点时，有两个人到他头前，一人将他头按住，一人就拿斧砍；张永堂头顶被砍伤三处，手上被砍伤一处。张永堂用力一挣扎，坐了起来，那两人就跑了。据张看见凶手是梁玉和、杨福二人：杨福按的头，梁玉和砍的。张被砍后，就大喊，村公安员张银桂、张永文去追凶犯，未追上；张永文（张永堂之兄）即到区报告。天亮时，区干部祖泽民、马寿山、田恩波等三人带着杨村几个民兵到了该村进行了解后，当即将梁、杨逮捕送到了县。
    三、审讯和调查情形：
    县受理此案后，经审讯，梁玉和承认与张有仇，是他砍的，但未有杨福。杨福也不承认有自己。但原告屡供是杨福、梁玉和二人所为。
    四、处理结果：
    根据这个情况，我们对该二人进行了不同的处理。梁玉和行凶砍人属实，同时该犯在当伪军时还有人命案，待调查清楚后即行判处。杨福砍人与否因不能证实，在去年十二月初旬已取保释放。
    五、杨作然批评信内容与事实不符的几点：
    １、杨称：在六月十三日发生此案的那天晚上（十点时），其父去地里拉麦子。经我们调查那时杨福并没拉麦子。
    ２、杨称：区干部送其父与梁玉和去县时，该村政府不知道。经调查村干部都知道此事。
    ３、杨称：村干部曾进行调解，让其家中出十石小麦给被砍者。经调查村干部并未作调解。
    ４、杨称：被砍者住的是深宅大院。经派员去勘验，此院并非深宅大院，从后边可以直接上房。
    ５、杨所称王院长的谈话，与事实也不符。
    六、对处理此案件的检讨：
    据我们分析，杨福嫌疑很大；但不能证实。我们也未作及时的处理。到十一月份重点放在了清理反革命案件，对此案拖延下了，这点我们已作了检讨。
                                       定兴县人民法院
    编者按：杨作然的信，发表在本报一九五○年十二月十一日第三版。定兴县人民法院对杨作然的父亲有行凶嫌疑案，拖延了很久，现已进行了处理。该院来信中提到，杨作然对他父亲涉讼案件的反映，某些地方与事实不符。但主要的情况——因行凶嫌疑而被监禁约半年之久的情况，我们认为是符合事实的。我们发表杨作然的来信的意思，即在于说明定兴法院应迅速处理此案：有罪即应判罪，无罪即应释放。至于杨作然所反映的某些具体情况如确与事实不符，这也是不应当的。我们对报纸写稿，反映问题，一定要真实，要对事实负责。
