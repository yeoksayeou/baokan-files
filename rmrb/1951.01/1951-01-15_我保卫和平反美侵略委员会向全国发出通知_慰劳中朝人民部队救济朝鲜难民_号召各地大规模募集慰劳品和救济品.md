Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression today issued the following notice regarding launching a nationwide effort to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army and to relieve Korean refugees:

　　In order to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army who are fighting heroically against the American aggressors in the frozen fields of Korea, and to relieve the Korean refugees who have been ravaged by the American aggressors and their lackeys and who lack clothing, food, and housing in the cold winter, this committee has decided, in conjunction with the China People's Relief Administration and the Red Cross Society of China, to launch a large-scale nationwide campaign to raise comfort goods and relief supplies, and this committee will be responsible for unified collection.

　　The collection of comfort goods and relief supplies must be based entirely on the willingness of the people throughout the country. Therefore, it is hoped that the local branches of this committee will quickly invite representatives from local relief organizations and other people's organizations, institutions, factories, and schools to jointly launch a mass movement to collect comfort goods and relief supplies. The Northeast region should focus on collecting food; cotton-producing areas should focus on collecting cotton cloth, and may also collect some clothing; other regions, especially those far from Korea and inconvenient for transportation, should collect cash only, including RMB and gold and silver jewelry.

　　In order to facilitate centralization, it is hoped that local branches will designate banks to be responsible for collecting cash on their behalf, and designate warehouses to be responsible for collecting food and goods on their behalf; in places where branches of this committee have not been established, it is hoped that appropriate people's organizations will be designated to be responsible for the collection work. Banks and warehouses should report the amounts of funds and physical objects received to the branch (or designated people's organization) daily. The local branches of this committee (or designated people's organizations) should telegraph the amounts of funds and physical objects received to this committee on the last day of each ten-day period. After the funds and physical objects are centralized, they will be handled in a unified manner by this committee in conjunction with the China People's Relief Administration and the Red Cross Society of China.

　　我保卫和平反美侵略委员会向全国发出通知
    慰劳中朝人民部队救济朝鲜难民
    号召各地大规模募集慰劳品和救济品
    【新华社十四日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，今日发出关于在全国发起慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并救济朝鲜难民的通知全文如下：
    为了慰劳在朝鲜的冰天雪地中向美国侵略者英勇作战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，为了救济惨遭美国侵略者及其走狗蹂躏的、在寒冬缺少衣被粮食房屋的朝鲜难民，本会决定会同中国人民救济总会和中国红十字总会，发起在全国大规模地募集慰劳品和救济品，并由本会负责统一募集。
    慰劳品和救济品的募集，必须完全依靠全国人民的自愿。因此，希望本会各地分会，迅速邀集各地的救济团体及其他人民团体、机关、工厂、学校的代表，共同发起募集慰劳品救济品的群众运动。东北地区以募集食粮为主；产棉地区以募集棉花布匹为主，并可募集一部分衣服；其他地区特别是距朝鲜较远、运输不便的地区，一概募集现金，包括人民币和金银首饰。
    为了便于集中，望各地分会指定银行负责代收现金，指定仓库负责代收粮食、物品；在未成立本会分会的地方并希指定适当的人民团体负责募集工作。银行和仓库应每日向分会（或指定的人民团体）报告所收款项和实物的数字。本会的各地分会（或指定的人民团体）应于每旬的最末一日向本会电报所收款项和实物数字。在款项和实物集中以后，概由本会会同中国人民救济总会和中国红十字会统筹处理。
