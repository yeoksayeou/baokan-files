Ren Fenghua is a model teacher who has persisted in social education work in northern Shaanxi for sixteen years. He is from Renjiagou Village, Wubao County, northern Shaanxi, and is forty-six years old this year. In 1921, after graduating from the Yulin County Elementary Normal School, he taught in elementary schools in Wubao, Suide, and other counties for eleven years. In 1935, he returned to his hometown and took on the task of educating out-of-school children and youth. Renjiagou Village is a village that has already completed land reform, and his work immediately received the support of the local people and government. He began to promote literacy classes to the farmers, telling them that they would not have to spend money and ensuring that it would not interfere with production. At first, the farmers didn't quite believe him, so only twenty children in the whole village attended the literacy class. At that time, the young people and children in the village had a bad habit of gambling, which made the adults at home very angry, but they couldn't control it. He grasped this problem and organized these twenty students into a "Literacy and Anti-Gambling Association." After three months of hard work in education, the children who participated in the literacy class not only got rid of their bad habit of gambling but also worked diligently. Each child also learned more than four hundred characters. This achievement changed the villagers' perception of the literacy class, and they sent all seventy young men, women, and children who should have been in school to the literacy class.

After his success in running literacy classes in Renjiagou Village, farmers from neighboring villages also came to ask him to run literacy classes. He happily agreed. But he knew that one person could not teach several villages. He first went to each village to select people who could recognize some characters from the masses to be teachers, and then organized the students into teams, classes, and groups. Then, he used his own "character transmission method" to teach characters. The so-called "character transmission method" is that he first wrote the characters to be taught on paper, and then transmitted them to the teachers of the literacy classes in each village to teach. The first time he sent characters to a village, he personally delivered them and taught the first lesson himself, so that the teacher of the literacy class had an opportunity to learn how to teach. After the literacy class in this village had taught these characters, the paper slip was transmitted to other villages along the predetermined transmission route. At that time, in the rural areas of northern Shaanxi, where textbooks and paper were lacking and the level of teachers was very low, Ren Fenghua used the "character transmission method" for five years. By 1940, there were already eighty-five literacy classes under his leadership; the number of students increased from twenty to one thousand seven hundred and one. The students who knew the most characters could recognize more than three thousand characters, and the students who knew the least also recognized seven or eight hundred characters. Now, more than seventy cadres in the Suide District of Shaanxi Province are former students he taught. Many of these students are already county-level cadres, and some have been able to take on the work of the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. Because his work achieved great results, he was awarded the honorary title of "Illiteracy Eradication Hero" at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Cultural and Educational Conference in 1941. In the past five years, he has also received four certificates of merit from the Suide Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Wubao County Government. This spring, at the Wubao County People's Congress, it was decided that he would be responsible for leading the county's literacy movement.

Why was Ren Fenghua able to do his work so well? Because in his work, he had a solid, arduous, and tenacious style and a spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Once, he braved the wind and snow to deliver characters to Xinjiashan Village, which was more than twenty miles away from his home, and the snow water soaked his shoes, socks, and half of his trouser legs. When he saw that the students had all arrived, he immediately started teaching them the characters. Some people advised him to wait until he had dried his clothes and eaten before teaching, but he smiled and said, "My heart is warm, and I'm not cold." His life was very frugal. For the first two years, he taught without pay. Later, the People's Government gave him a salary equivalent to that of an elementary school teacher. He often saved money to use as funding for the literacy class and as bonuses for the students.

He was constantly thinking about how to improve teaching methods. He taught students single characters, selecting them according to four criteria: few strokes, commonly used in daily life, easy to remember the pronunciation, and easy to understand the meaning. He was particularly familiar with the psychology of children and young people. He grasped the characteristics that children love to hear jokes and like to be praised, so he often used the following methods when teaching: The first method was to compile the characters into jokes and riddles. For example, when teaching the character "告" (gào, to tell), he would first say "One bite bit the ox's tail." When the students couldn't guess it, he would take advantage of their focused attention to explain it, so that the students would remember the characters they learned both well and firmly. The second method was to use real objects or pictures to help with teaching. The third method was to use actions to express the meaning. The fourth method was to use the "incitement" method to teach some difficult-to-recognize characters. He deliberately said that a certain character was very difficult to learn, in order to attract the students' attention and ask them to write it out and teach it quickly. This also helped the students remember.

　　扫除文盲的英雄任逢华
    姚文华
    任逢华是在陕北坚持了十六年社会教育工作的模范教师。他是陕北吴堡县任家沟村人，今年四十六岁。一九二一年，他在榆林县单级师范毕业以后，就在吴堡、绥德等县教了十一年小学。一九三五年他回到家乡，担负起教育失学儿童和青年的工作。任家沟村是一个已经完成了土地改革的村庄，他的工作一开始即得到了当地人民和政府的赞助。他开始向农民们宣传办识字班，他不叫农民花钱，并保证不误生产。农民们开头不大相信他，所以全村只有二十个孩子上了识字班。当时村里的青年、儿童有个坏毛病，就是爱赌钱，家里大人们很生气，但是管不了。他掌握了这个问题，把这二十个学生组成了一个“识字禁赌会”。经过他三个月的努力教育以后，参加识字班的孩子们，不但改掉了爱赌钱的坏毛病，而且干活勤快。每个孩子还学会了四百多个字。这个成绩，使村里的农民改变了对识字班的看法，把应该上学的七十个男女青年、儿童，都送到识字班去。
    他在任家沟村办识字班成功以后，邻村农民们，也都来要求他去办识字班。他高兴地答应了。可是他知道一个人教几个村子是教不过来的。他先到各村去选择群众中能认得些字的人当教员，又把学生们都按队、班、组组织好，然后用他自己创造的“传字法”来教字。所谓“传字法”，就是他先把要教的字写在纸上，再传送给各村子识字班的教员去教。在第一次送字到一个村子去的时候，他都亲自送去，并由自己上第一堂课，使该识字班的教员有一次学习怎样教学的机会。在这个村的识字班教过了这些字以后，就把这个纸条顺着预定的传送路线再传送到别的村子去。在当时陕北农村中缺乏课本、纸张和教员水平很低的条件下，任逢华用“传字法”教了五年。到一九四零年，在他领导下的识字班已经有八十五个了；学生从二十人增加到一千七百零一人。学生们识字最多的，能识三千字以上，最少的也识了七、八百字。现在陕西省绥德分区有七十多个干部都是他过去教的学生。这些学生中有不少已经是县的干部，有的已经能担负起中共县委宣传部的工作。因为他的工作获得了很大的成绩，他在一九四一年召开的陕甘宁边区文教大会上，得到了“扫盲英雄”的光荣称号。最近五年中，他又先后得过绥德专署和吴堡县政府的四个奖状。今年春天，在吴堡县各界人民代表大会上，决定由他负责领导全县的识字运动。
    任逢华的工作，为什么能做好呢？因为他在工作中，有踏实、艰苦、顽强的作风和忠心耿耿为人民服务的精神。有一次他冒着风雪，送字给离家二十多里路的辛家山村，雪水湿透了他的鞋袜和半截裤腿。当他看到学生们都已到齐了的时候，他就马上给学生教字了。有些人劝他等烤干衣服，吃过饭以后再教，他笑着说：“心是热的，身上也不冷。”他的生活很刻苦，开始两年是义务教学，后来人民政府给了他一个相当于小学教员的待遇。他常常省下钱，给识字班作经费和给学生的奖金。
    他时刻地想着怎样改进教学方法。他给学生教单字，按笔画少、日常能用、字音好记、意义好懂的四个标准来选择。他对儿童和青年的心理摸得特别熟，他掌握了儿童们爱听笑话，喜人表扬的特点，所以他在教学时，常用以下几个方法：第一种办法是把字编成笑话、谜语。如在教“告”字时，他就先说“一口咬了牛尾巴”，在学生猜不中时，就趁他们注意力集中时加以说明，这样学生就对所学的字记得又熟又牢了。第二种办法是用实物或者图画来帮助教学。第三种办法是用动作来表示意思。第四种办法是对一些很难认的字，他就用“激将”法来教。他故意说有某一个字非常难学，以引起学生们的注意，并要求他赶快写出来教。这样也帮助了学生记忆。
