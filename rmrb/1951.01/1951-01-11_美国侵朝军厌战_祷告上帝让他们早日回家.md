　　U.S. Aggressor Troops in Korea War-Weary
    Pray to God to Let Them Return Home Soon
    [Xinhua News Agency, Ninth Dispatch] "Pray to God to let them return home soon" - this is the state of mind of the American aggressor troops in the Korean front lines when they attend church services.
    International News Service reporter Burham reported on such events in a dispatch on the 7th. He said that when he went to an army church to attend a service on that day, "the soldiers filed in, many with rifles and carbines in their hands. They first stopped at the door, took the guns off their shoulders, and then walked into the church, filing into the seats and clamping the guns between their legs." He said that he saw U.S. aggressor army Eighth Army Commander Ridgway among those praying. The reporter also said: "When these soldiers kneel down to pray, you can tell where they have been by looking at their shoes. Some shoes are covered with a layer of mud from the battlefield, indicating that they walked into the church without having time to change their shoes after a long journey." "The pastor seemed to know the problems in the hearts of those attending the service. He prayed to God to let these people return home soon."

　　美国侵朝军厌战
    祷告上帝让他们早日回家
    【新华社九日讯】“祷告上帝使他们早日回家”——这是朝鲜前线溃败中的美国侵略军的士兵们做礼拜时的心境。
    美国国际新闻社记者秉汉在七日的电讯中报道了他看到的这样的事情。他这一天到一个陆军教堂去做礼拜时，“士兵们鱼贯地走进门，许多人手里拿着步枪和卡宾枪。他们先在门口停了下来，把枪从肩上放下，然后走进教堂，鱼贯地走到座位坐下来，把枪夹在两脚之间。”他说，在这些祷告的人中看见了美国侵略军第八军军长李奇微。该记者又说：“当这些军人跪下来做祷告时，你看到他们的鞋子就可以知道他们到过什么地方。有的鞋子上面沾了一层战场上的污泥，表明他们在长途跋涉之后没有来得及换鞋子就走进教堂。”“牧师似乎知道做礼拜的人内心里的问题。他祷告上帝使这些人早日回家。”
