Huiwen Middle School Faculty and Staff in Patriotic Study of Resisting America and Aiding Korea

Chen Hong

Huiwen Middle School was the earliest school established in Beijing by the American Church. It has been around for eighty-one years since its founding. Huiwen was registered with the U.S. government. Before 1927, the principal and academic dean were Americans. Due to the long-term influence of "American-style" education, many faculty and staff believed that the American establishment of Huiwen was an "expression of friendship" and a "charitable act." Therefore, they often intentionally or unintentionally promoted "American material civilization" to students, encouraging them to emulate "American lifestyles."

After the start of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the students of Huiwen awakened, urgently demanding to understand the new situation of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and requiring teachers to lead them in all aspects. Under the demands of the masses, the school authorities had to change the curriculum content to take "understanding the essence of American aggression" as the teaching center. However, at that time, teachers who were politically unclear found it difficult to be competent, and they could not answer the questions raised by the students. Some teachers even aroused great dissatisfaction among students because they intentionally or unintentionally spread pro-American and worship-America thoughts. In this great movement, the general teachers lagged far behind the students. Therefore, the labor union and the student union convened a general meeting of all faculty and staff, at which the school administration and the labor union explained that teachers must strive for progress in order to become leaders of students. At this time, many faculty and staff also put forward requests to strengthen the study of current affairs and politics.

Since the end of last November, under the slogan of "Study well, teach well, is patriotism," Huiwen faculty and staff have set off an unprecedented wave of learning. In the past two months, they have generally studied issues such as "A History of American Aggression Against China," "How to Understand America," and "American Monopoly Capital." They also carefully studied every important editorial in the People's Daily and Wu Xiuquan's speech at the United Nations. The study of current affairs and politics has made the faculty and staff realize the true face of American imperialism. In particular, the exposure of the conspiracy of American imperialism to carry out cultural aggression in China has solved the confused thoughts that had been unsolved for decades. Therefore, their learning enthusiasm is very high. They have all carefully studied many reference books and documents, and some have also carefully taken notes and made summaries. Everyone is particularly interested in discussing current affairs. Some groups often discuss until 7:00 or 8:00 in the evening and are reluctant to disperse. The active and serious study of current affairs in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has greatly improved the thinking of the faculty and staff of Huiwen Middle School. What is particularly valuable is that they bravely used the weapons of criticism and self-criticism and reviewed their past wrong ideas.

Principal Gao Fengshan took the lead in criticizing his past thoughts at a general meeting of all faculty and staff. He said: "I have been dealing with American missionaries for more than sixty years. Now, in retrospect, I deeply feel that I have indeed been influenced by the poison of American education, that is, the pro-American feelings and democratic individualism that I had in the past. For example, the reason why I sold land to study in the United States back then was to worship the United States." Then, based on his personal experience, he described the tragic situation he saw in the southern United States in 1941, where coal miners and black people were exploited by capitalists.

Li Yixin is the director of teaching affairs at Huiwen. He grew up in American church schools since he was a child. During his entire study period, all tuition, miscellaneous fees, room and board were provided by Americans. Therefore, he has always been grateful for the "benevolence" of the Americans, and believed that the Americans spent money to run schools, churches, hospitals, and charitable undertakings in China, and sent John Leighton Stuart, Liu Hailan and others to help China run education and medical undertakings, which was worthy of great praise. But after this study, his views changed. He wrote frankly in his ideological summary: "Because the Americans sent me to study in the United States, it made me feel that everything in the United States was good, which gave rise to pro-American and worship-America thoughts. Today, I realize that the U.S. imperialists run education in China, and in their bones they are coming to anesthetize us and make us lose our national self-esteem. In the past, I thought I was promoting education and making contributions to the people, but I knew that it was completely serving American imperialism. Today, I firmly agree that church schools should completely cut off relations with American imperialism, and the church should implement self-government, self-propagation, and self-support."

Shi Yixuan, an English teacher, an old Christian who had always trusted the U.S. government and studied in the United States, also began to use his learning experience as new content for his lectures. He said to the students: "For decades, I have always regarded the American government and the American people as the same thing. Today, I know that the American people are being bullied and oppressed by the government. Now American imperialism has become a mad dog, and we must overthrow it, just like overthrowing Japanese imperialism." Before the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, he expressed great dissatisfaction with his son's request to join the Communist Youth League. But recently, when his son raised this question again, he spent a whole night carefully reading the League's constitution. He felt that "every sentence in the League's constitution is the truth," so he said to his son: "It doesn't matter if you don't believe in the Lord, as long as you believe in the truth."

Yao Shiyuan, a music teacher from a Christian family, used to blindly worship the United States, thinking that speaking English sounded better than speaking Chinese, envying Americans for being "rich," living in high-rise buildings, riding in cars, and fantasizing about American life. However, when he saw clearly that American imperialism used churches, cultural institutions, etc. as tools of aggression, and saw their "bestial civilization" in Korea, he changed his original views and stood on the side of the people. In July, he began to write songs such as "Ode to the Korean People's Chorus" and "Volunteer Army March." Now, in response to his previous view of "worshiping European and American music and despising folk songs and mass songs," he has made a deep review and boldly led students to create more than 20 new songs in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

When all the faculty and staff of Huiwen Middle School made great progress in their thinking, everyone felt that they had a "demand for action." Therefore, when celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang and protesting against Austin's shameless slander, the teachers took the lead in going out for demonstrations. An old teacher said with emotion during the parade: "In the past, I felt very shabby to march with the students, but now I feel it is a right and an honor." After the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued a decision on handling cultural and educational institutions that accept American subsidies, they unanimously expressed their firm support for the government's decision, and will redouble their efforts to run people's education undertakings in the future. On January 2, Huiwen Middle School, together with Beiman Girls' Middle School and eight other church schools, issued a declaration condemning American cultural aggression, which stated: "After the American imperialists plundered the property of the Chinese people, they took out a very small amount of money to run 'charitable undertakings,' and used preaching, running hospitals and schools to buy people's hearts. Today, we must strengthen unity and, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, work together to completely crush the cultural aggression of American imperialism."

　　汇文中学教职员在抗美援朝爱国学习中的收获
    陈泓
    汇文中学是美国教会在北京最早兴办的学校。它成立至今已有八十一年。汇文曾在美国政府立案。一九二七年前，校长、教务长都是美国人。由于“美式”教育的长期薰染，不少教职员认为美国办汇文是一种“友谊的表现”，是“慈善的行为”，因此，他们都时常有意或无意地向学生宣传“美国的物质文明”，鼓励学生模仿“美国的生活方式”。
    抗美援朝运动开始后，汇文的学生们觉醒了，迫切要求了解抗美援朝的新形势，要求教师们在各方面领导他们。在群众的要求下，学校当局不得不改变课程内容以“认识美国侵略本质”为教学中心。但是在那时候，政治上认识不清的教师就显得难以胜任，他们无法解答同学们所提的问题。有些教员更因为有意无意地散布亲美、崇美思想，而引起学生极大的不满。在这个伟大运动中，一般教师已远远地落在同学的后面。因此，工会学委会召开了全体教职员大会，由学校行政和工会说明教师必须努力追求进步，才能成为学生的领导者。很多教职员在这时候也提出了加强时事政治学习的要求。
    从去年十一月底开始，在“学好、教好，就是爱国”的口号下，汇文教职员掀起了有史以来从没有过的学习热潮。两个月中，他们普遍地学习了“美国侵华史”，“怎样认识美国”和“美国的独占资本”等问题。人民日报的每次重要社论，伍修权在联合国的发言等等，他们也认真地学习了。时事政治的学习，使教职员们认识了美帝国主义的真象。特别是美帝国主义在中国进行文化侵略的阴谋的揭露，给大家解决了数十年来解决不了的糊涂思想。因此他们的学习情绪非常高涨。他们都认真地学习了许多参考书和文件，有的还仔细作笔记和提要。大家对时事学习讨论得特别感兴趣，有的小组经常讨论到晚上七八点钟都不肯散。抗美援朝运动中对时事积极认真地学习，使汇文中学的教职员在思想上有很大的进步，特别可贵的是他们勇敢地运用了批评与自我批评的武器，联系过去的错误思想作了检讨。
    校长高凤山带头在全体教职员大会上批判了他过去的思想。他说：“我和美国传教师打交道已经六十多年了。现在检讨起来，我深自觉得的确受了美国教育毒素的影响，那就是过去亲美的情感和民主个人主义思想。譬如我当年卖了地到美国去留学，就是为了崇拜美国。”接着他还以亲身的经历，讲述了一九四一年在美国南部所看到的煤矿工人和黑人被资本家压榨的惨状。
    李义信是汇文的教导主任。他从小就在美国教会学校里成长。在他整个念书时期，一切学杂膳宿费用全由美国人供给，因此他一向都感激美国人的“恩赐”，认为美国人出钱在中国办学校、教会、医院和慈善事业，派司徒雷登、刘海谰等来帮助中国办教育和医疗事业，是值得大大颂扬的。但是经过这次的学习，他的看法改变了。他在思想总结里坦白地写道：“由于美国人送我到美国留学，使我觉得美国一切都好，从而产生了亲美、崇美思想；今天我才认识到美帝在中国办教育，骨子里是来麻醉我们，使我们失掉民族自尊心的最毒辣手段。过去我自以为在提倡教育，对人民有功，那知这完全是为美帝国主义服务；今天我坚决赞成教会学校完全与美帝斩断关系，教会实行自治、自传和自养。”
    一向信任美国政府的老基督教徒、留美的英文教员史译宣，也开始运用他的学习心得来作为讲课的新内容了。他对学生们说：“几十年来我一直把美国政府和美国人民看成一回事，今天才知道美国人民是受政府欺侮和压迫的。现在美帝国主义已变成疯狗，我们必须把它打倒，如同打倒日本帝国主义一样。”在抗美援朝运动展开以前，他对他儿子要求入团表示大大不满。但最近当儿子再提出这个问题时，他花了一整晚的工夫仔细阅读团章，他觉得“团章上每一句话都是真理”，因此就对儿子说：“你不信主也罢，反正只要相信真理就行。”
    出身于基督教家庭里的音乐教师姚世源，他从前曾经盲目地崇拜过美国，觉得说英文比说中文好听，羡慕美国人“有钱”，住高楼，坐汽车，幻想美国的生活。但是，当他看清了美帝国主义利用教会、文化机关等作为侵略工具，又看到他们在朝鲜的“兽行文明”时，他就改变原来的观点，站在人民的一面来。七月间，他开始写作《歌颂朝鲜人民大合唱》和《志愿军进行曲》等歌曲，现在他针对着先前“崇拜欧美音乐，对民歌和群众歌声瞧不起”的看法，作了深刻的检讨，并且在抗美援朝运动中领导同学大胆地创作了二十多支新曲子。
    汇文全体教职员，当他们在思想上获得很大进步时，大家都感到有了“行动的要求”，于是在庆祝平壤光复、抗议奥斯汀无耻谰言时，老师们带头出去游行。一位年老的老师在游行时感慨地说：“过去我觉得跟学生一起游行很寒怆，现在却感觉是一种权利与光荣。”中央人民政府政务院发布关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育机关的决定后，他们一致表示坚决拥护政府的决策，今后更要加倍地为办好人民教育事业而努力。一月二日汇文中学联合贝满女中等其他八个教会学校，发表痛责美帝文化侵略的宣言，其中说：“美帝掠夺了中国人民的财产后，拿出极有数的钱来办‘慈善事业’，通过传教，办医院、学校，来收买人心。今天我们要加紧团结，在中央人民政府的领导下，共同为彻底粉碎美帝的文化侵略而奋斗。”（京市新闻处稿）
