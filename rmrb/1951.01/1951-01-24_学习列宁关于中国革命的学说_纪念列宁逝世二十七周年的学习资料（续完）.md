    On Party Building
    In November 1919, in his report at the Second All-Russia Congress of Communist Organizations of the Peoples of the East, Lenin put forward the following task to the parties of the Eastern peoples:
    "Here, before you, stands a task which has never before confronted communists anywhere in the world: relying upon the general communist theory and practice, you must adapt yourselves to specific conditions such as do not exist in the European countries; you must be able to apply that theory and practice to conditions in which the bulk of the population are peasants, and the task is to wage a struggle not against capital, but against medieval survivals. That is a difficult and specific task, but it is also a rewarding one, because it is drawing into the struggle masses who have never before taken part in it." ("On the Awakening of the Peoples of the East," p. 68 in the same book)
    This is indeed a difficult and unique task. Because concerning the colonial and semi-colonial question, although Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin each made principled examinations from the general standpoint of proletarian revolution in the different eras in which they lived, and also made many specific theoretical instructions for these individual countries, they did not and could not solve all the principle and practical problems of the revolution for these individual countries. Therefore, the arduous task of using the general principles of Marxism-Leninism to completely solve the theoretical and practical problems of revolution in each country cannot but fall on the shoulders of the communist parties of those countries themselves. Moreover, this is a task that must be completed, because mastering the theory of Marxism-Leninism and being good at creatively applying it to the revolution in one's own country is the primary condition for the communist parties of those countries to guide their country's revolution to victory.
    The Chinese Communist Party, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, has brilliantly completed the task pointed out by Lenin. Comrade Mao Zedong, on behalf of the Chinese proletariat and the Chinese people, creatively applied the highest wisdom of mankind—Marxism-Leninism, which originated and developed in capitalist Europe—to China, a large semi-colonial and semi-feudal country with peasants as the main masses, anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism as direct tasks, particularly powerful enemies, particularly complex class structures, constantly changing political and economic conditions, and extremely difficult revolutionary struggles. Thus, the thought of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution—Mao Zedong Thought—was formed, creating a complete set of theories and policies on Chinese history, Chinese revolution, and construction. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once summarized the basic road taken domestically by the Chinese people to achieve victory—the Mao Zedong Road—into a formula containing four points (see his "Opening Speech at the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference"), and pointed out: "This road may also become the basic road for the people of other colonial and semi-colonial countries in similar situations to fight for liberation." ("Opening Speech at the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference") This means that Mao Zedong's revolutionary doctrine not only brilliantly solved China's problems, but also solved many problems of many colonial and semi-colonial countries that Lenin said "had never been raised before communists around the world" and "cannot be found in any communist book, but must be solved."
    Regarding the issue of party building, in addition to the theoretical construction mentioned above, Lenin's doctrine that has had a particularly profound impact on the Chinese Party also lies in the issue of party building principles. Although Lenin did not directly say anything to China on this issue, he said a lot elsewhere. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out, the Chinese Party "was built according to Lenin's principles," he said:
    "The construction of the Chinese Party took place after the October Revolution, after the Russian Bolsheviks had already won victory and there was a living example. Therefore, from the beginning, it was built under the guidance of the Communist International, according to Lenin's principles." ("On Inner-Party Struggle")
    Regarding the important significance of building the Chinese Communist Party according to Lenin's principles for our country's revolution, Comrade Chen Boda gave a good explanation in "The October Socialist Revolution and the Chinese Revolution." Here, we can quote the following passage from him:
    "Avoiding the tradition of social democracy and building the party of the Chinese working class according to the principles of Bolshevism of Lenin and Stalin is the most concentrated and fundamental influence that the October Revolution gave to the Chinese revolution. This influence determined the fate of the Chinese revolution. As everyone knows: the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is the result of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the assistance of international revolutionary forces in various ways. Without the leadership of this party, the Chinese people could not have been liberated from the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, but the reason why this party was able to lead the revolution all the way to victory, is because this party accepted the Bolshevism of Lenin and Stalin, and carried out the Chinese Revolution according to the needs and characteristics of the Chinese people." (Inaugural Issue of "Sino-Soviet Friendship")
    This is also what Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If there is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary party in the style of Lenin and Stalin. Without such a revolutionary party, without a revolutionary party built according to the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." ("Unite All Revolutionary Forces to Oppose Imperialist Aggression") It is precisely because we have such a Bolshevik party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and have the leadership of such a party, that we have achieved victory. And the creation and development of this party is inseparable from Lenin's name and Lenin's doctrine on party building.
    During the Xinhai Revolution, Lenin published a famous article in "Pravda" entitled "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia." Lenin said: "Who does not know that Europe is advanced and Asia is backward? Yet the words in the title of this article contain a bitter truth." Lenin mainly referred to the fact of China's awakening when speaking of this "bitter truth." He filled this article with cheers for the situation of "hundreds of millions of people awakening and moving towards life, light, and freedom."
    Originally, in history, Asia was once advanced. China, the largest country in Asia, had consistently been at the forefront of world civilization for thousands of years. Only in the last hundred years or so has China fallen behind Europe. These hundred years or so have been the most suffering time for our Chinese nation. We have long been defeated and unable to recover, and have long been subjected to bullying, insult, and enslavement. However, the outstanding figures and revolutionary pioneers of our nation were unwilling to accept this state of backwardness and oppression, and therefore carried out a long struggle with selfless devotion and successive efforts. Finally, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." China's advanced elements found this only weapon to save China, and found the correct path for revolution: learn from the example of the Russian Revolution—follow the path of the Russians. In this way, the Chinese people rapidly surpassed the already corrupt European capitalist countries in thought, politics, and even military affairs in a short period of thirty years, and a new situation of great liberation and great awakening of nearly five hundred million people appeared in the world. Who says Asia is still backward? Moreover, due to the close and solid union of the seven hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union, a situation has been formed in which the two largest and most advanced countries on the Eurasian continent are united, which is a fortress of human civilization, light, and progress. And capitalist Europe and America are truly backward. The rulers there—the bourgeoisie—are approaching the eve of their death. Standing before them is their gravedigger—the advanced proletariat.
    "Please look at the world today, whose world is it after all?" This question is already crystal clear.
    As the great Lenin wrote in his last article for the East before his death: "The outcome of the struggle depends in the last analysis on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., account for the overwhelming majority of the population of the globe. And it is precisely this majority that, during the past few years, has been drawn into the struggle for emancipation with extraordinary rapidity, so that in this respect there cannot be the slightest doubt what the final outcome of the world struggle will be. In this sense, the complete victory of socialism is fully and absolutely assured." ("On the National Revolution in the East and the Final Victory of Socialism," pp. 101, 102 in the same book)
    Lenin—the wisdom, honor, and conscience of mankind—will live forever in the memory of people all over the world for generations to come!
    Long live the great victory of Marxism-Leninism among all mankind!

    关于党的建设
    列宁在一九一九年十一月，在东方各民族共产主义组织第二次全俄代表大会上的报告中，向东方各民族的党提出了这样的一个任务：
    “在这里，在你们面前摆着一个任务，这个任务从前在全世界共产党员面前是没有提出过的，这个任务就是：依靠一般共产主义的理论和实践，你们在应用于欧洲各国所没有的独特条件时，须要善于把这个理论和实践应用于这样的条件，即农民是主要群众，所要解决的斗争任务不是反对资本而是反对中世纪的残余。这是一个艰巨而又独特的任务，然而这个任务是特别会有成果的，因为这把还没有参加过斗争的群众都卷入斗争中了。”（“论东方各民族的觉醒”，同上书六十八页）
    这的确是一个艰巨而又独特的任务。因为关于殖民地半殖民地问题，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林虽然各在他们所处的不同的时代里已站在无产阶级革命的总的立场上作了原则的考察，并且对这些各别的国家还做了不少具体的理论指示，但是他们并没有也不可能替这些各别的国家解决革命的全部原则问题和全部实际问题。因此，运用马列主义的一般原则来全部解决各该国革命的理论与实际问题的艰巨任务，就不能不落在各该国共产党自己的身上。而且这又是一个必须去完成的任务，因为精通马列主义的理论，善于创造地应用到本国革命中来，乃是各该国共产党要引导其本国革命走向胜利的首要条件。
    中国共产党，以毛泽东同志为代表，是光辉地完成了列宁所指出的任务了的。毛泽东同志正是代表中国无产阶级与中国人民将在资本主义的欧洲产生与发展起来的人类最高智慧——马克思列宁主义，创造地应用于中国这样以农民为主要群众，以反帝反封建为直接任务，而敌人特别强大，阶级结构特别复杂，政治经济的情况变化多端，革命斗争极其困难的半殖民地半封建的大国。从而形成了马列主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合的思想——毛泽东思想，创造了关于中国历史、关于中国革命与建设的一整套的完整的理论和政策。刘少奇同志曾把中国人民取得胜利的在国内所实行的基本道路——毛泽东道路，归纳为一个包含四点内容的公式（见他的“亚洲澳洲工会代表会议开幕词”），并且指出：“这条道路也可能成为情形相类似的其他殖民地半殖民地国家的人民争取解放的基本道路。”（“亚洲澳洲工会代表会议开幕词”）这就是说，毛泽东的革命学说不但是光辉地解决了中国的、而且是解决了许多殖民地半殖民地国家的列宁所说的“从前在全世界共产党员面前没有提出过的”、“在任何一本共产主义的书里都找不到，但却必须加以解决的”许多问题。
    关于党的建设问题，除了上面说的理论建设问题以外，列宁的学说对于中国党特别有深刻影响的，还在于党的建设原则问题。关于这个问题，列宁虽然没有直接对中国说什么话，但是他在其他地方说得很多。是正像刘少奇同志所指出，中国党是“照着列宁的原则去进行建设的”，他说：
    “中国党的建设是在十月革命以后，是在俄国布尔什维克已经取得胜利，有了活的榜样以后，所以一开始就是在共产国际的指导之下，照着列宁的原则去进行建设的。”（“论党内斗争”）
    关于照着列宁的原则来建设中国共产党对于我国革命的重要意义，陈伯达同志在“十月社会主义革命与中国革命”一文中，曾有很好的说明，在这里，我们可以引他下面的这一段话：
    “避免社会民主主义的传统，根据列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义的原则而建设中国工人阶级的政党，这是十月革命所给予中国革命的最集中的和最根本的影响。这一个影响是决定了中国革命的命运的。正如大家所知道：中国人民革命的胜利，是由于以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导并获得国际革命力量各种不同方式的援助所得到的结果。没有这一个党的领导，中国人民就不可能从帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的压迫中解放出来，但这个党之所以能够领导革命一直到胜利，就是因为这个党接受了列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义，并按照中国人民的需要，按照中国的特点，来进行中国的革命。”（“中苏友好”创刊号）
    这也就是毛泽东同志说的：“既要革命，就要有一个列宁、斯大林式的革命党。没有这样一个革命党，没有一个按照马、恩、列、斯的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级及广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”（“全世界革命力量团结起来反对帝国主义的侵略”）正是因为我们有了这样一个以毛泽东同志为首的布尔什维主义的党，有了这样一个党的领导，我们才取得了胜利。而这个党的创造与发展，是和列宁的名字、列宁关于党的建设的学说不可分开的。
    在辛亥革命时期，列宁曾在“真理报”上发表一篇有名的文章，题目叫做“落后的欧洲与先进的亚洲”。列宁说：“谁不知道欧洲是先进的，而亚洲是落后的呢？然而在本文标题所用的词句中却有着辛辣的真理。”这个“辛辣的真理”，列宁主要是指中国的觉醒的事实而起言的。他在这篇文章里充满了对“几万万人觉醒起来，趋向于生活、光明、自由”的情况的欢呼。
    本来，在历史上，亚洲曾是先进的。亚洲的最大国家——中国，曾在几千年中经常居于世界文明的前列。只是在近一百多年间，中国才落于欧洲之后。这一百多年间，是我们中国民族最受苦难的时间，我们曾长期被人击败得爬不起来，长期受人欺凌、侮辱、奴役。但是我们民族的优秀人物、革命先行者们不甘心于这种落后和被压迫状态，因此进行了可歌可泣的前仆后继的长期奋斗。终于，像毛泽东同志所说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”，中国的先进分子找到了这个救中国的唯一武器，找到了进行革命的正确道路：学习俄国革命的榜样——走俄国人的路。这样，中国人民就在短短的三十年间迅速地在思想上、政治上以至军事上超过了已经腐朽的欧洲资本主义国家，而在世界上则出现了将近五万万人口的伟大解放和伟大觉醒的崭新的局面。谁说亚洲还是落后的呢？而且，由于中苏两国七万万人民的亲密无间的巩固的联合，就形成了欧亚两洲两个最大的最先进的国家联合一致的局面，这是人类的文明、光明和进步的堡垒。而资本主义的欧洲、美洲，则真正是落后了，那里的统治者——资产阶级已临近到死亡的前夕，站在它的面前的是它的掘墓人——先进的无产阶级。
    “请看今日之域中，竟是谁家之天下？”这个问题已经是洞若观火了。
    正如伟大的列宁在其逝世以前最后为东方写的一篇论文里所写：“斗争的结局归根到底是取决于这个情况：俄国、印度、中国等等占世界人口的极大多数。然而正是这大多数人口最近几年来非常迅速地卷入争取自身解放的斗争，所以在这个意义上，对于世界斗争问题最终将如何解决，不能有丝毫怀疑。在这个意义上，社会主义的最后胜利是完全和绝对有保证的。”（“论东方的民族革命与社会主义的最后胜利”同上书一○一、一○二页）
    列宁——人类的智慧、荣誉和良心，将永生在全世界世世代代人民的记忆之中！
    马克思列宁主义在全人类的伟大胜利万岁！
