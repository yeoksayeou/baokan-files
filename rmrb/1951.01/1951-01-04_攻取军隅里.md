Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, December 31st. Our correspondent at the Korean front reports on the process of the Chinese People's Volunteers capturing Kunuri:

　　After smashing the American military defense line from Sinheung-dong to Kujang north of the Chongchon River with overwhelming force, the Chinese People's Volunteers continued to surge south. A unit of the People's Volunteers who crossed the Chongchon River accepted the task of capturing Kunuri.

　　Kunuri – this railway junction on the south bank of the Chongchon River, was the main supply base for the American invading forces on the western front. After our People's Volunteers forcibly crossed the Chongchon River, the US 2nd Infantry Division occupied the town with more than a regiment of troops, serving as an important rear guard defense point to cover the American retreat.

　　Inspired by the slogan of "Crushing the enemy's offensive and changing the situation in Korea", the People's Volunteers, with their invincible spirit of continuous victories, endured severe cold, fatigue, and the hardship of going without food for five days, chasing towards Kunuri along the road to Anju.

　　The warriors of the assault platoon of the 8th Company, at the front of the chasing troops, moved forward searching with hand grenades. Platoon leader Yang Hongli led the first and third squads to seize the low hill north of Kunuri. By the moonlight, the warriors clearly saw dozens of cars and tanks parked on the street below, with robbers making a lot of noise and running around in confusion. The platoon leader ordered, "Get the bombs and grenades ready, blow up the tanks and cars when you see them!" Machine gunner Sun Ke-rong, nicknamed "Sun Erhu," holding his machine gun, said, "My machine gun is the order to charge, I will never fall behind the rifles in the charge!" He and his comrades rushed down the mountain in one breath, cutting off the enemy's passage in Kunuri street like a sharp knife, and seized more than ten cars loaded with weapons and ammunition at once. The warriors plunged into the enemy ranks and fought left and right. The robbers jumped into armored vehicles trying to escape, but Sun Erhu aimed his machine gun at the enemies on the armored vehicles and swept them away. The armored vehicles, carrying corpses, ran wildly in the street. The warriors chased them with hand grenades. The panicked enemies started two tanks, attempting to provide support, but when the soldier Shan Zhiyou saw them, he bravely rushed forward with his rifle. The American tank drivers panicked and hurriedly turned around to escape.

　　At this time, the follow-up troops also caught up. The warriors of the third platoon, covered in sweat, rushed straight to the street entrance in the town, just in time to meet five cars coming from the east. Machine gunner Hu Deshan calmly waited for the cars to get closer and fired two bursts of bullets in succession. The enemy's first ammunition vehicle immediately exploded with a bang, and the second one also caught fire. Hu Deshan and his comrades saw a concrete bridge not far away, and they thought this was a vital communication line, and they couldn't let the enemy escape from here. They ran over, set up the machine gun under a big tree at the bridgehead, and waited. At this moment, they heard a rumbling noise coming from the west, and the enemy's tanks were coming. Hu Deshan perked up his spirits, hugged the machine gun, and fired fiercely. The tanks burst into flames and stopped not far away. Hu Deshan was having a great time fighting when he suddenly saw four big guys running over in a panic 20 to 30 meters away from the bridgehead. Hu Deshan thought to himself, "You came at the right time," and led Xiao Gui and Li Honggeng to meet them and capture prisoners. One of the big guys suddenly pounced on Hu Deshan, and the two wrestled together. Hu Deshan was not strong enough and was pressed to the ground by the big guy. Xiao Gui, in a moment of quick thinking, forcefully grabbed the guy's automatic rifle and hit him hard on the back, the guy let out a scream, got up and ran away.

　　On this night, gunshots and grenade explosions echoed everywhere in Kunuri. The brave infantry of the People's Volunteers were clearing out the confused and dazed enemies. The enemy artillery, which had dug positions on the outskirts of Kunuri, did not know where to fire, and had to blindly fire a few shots into the distance before fleeing in a panic. The warriors of the People's Volunteers occupied Kunuri, the streets were littered with enemy corpses, and destroyed cars and tanks were burning. All the ammunition and flour depots that the enemy had stockpiled in the town were captured intact by our People's Volunteers.

### 攻取军隅里

　　攻取军隅里
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地十二月三十一日电】本社朝鲜前线记者报道我国人民志愿军攻取军隅里的经过称：
    我国人民志愿军以排山倒海之势，击碎清川江以北新兴洞——球场一线美军防线后，继续汹涌南进。渡过清川江的人民志愿军一部接受了攻取军隅里的任务。
    军隅里——这个清川江南岸的铁路联结点，是西线美国侵略军的主要补给基地。我人民志愿军强渡清川江后，美步兵第二师以一个多团兵力踞守该镇，作为掩护美军退却的重要后卫防御点。
    人民志愿军战士们以连战连捷的无敌精神，在“粉碎敌人进攻，改变朝鲜战局”的口号的鼓舞下，忍受着严寒疲劳和五天吃不上饭的艰苦，沿着通往安州的大道，向军隅里追击。
    在追击部队最前面的第八连突击排的勇士们，揭开了手榴弹搜索前进。排长杨鸿礼带领一、三班抢占了军隅里北面的矮山岗。借着月光，勇士们清楚地看见山下大街上停着几十辆汽车、坦克，强盗们在吵吵闹闹来回乱跑。排长命令说：“准备好炸弹手榴弹，碰到坦克、汽车就炸！”绰号叫做“孙二虎”的机枪射手孙克荣，端着机枪说：“我的机枪就是冲锋令，冲锋决不落在步枪后面！”他和战友们一口气冲下山去，像一把锋利的尖刀斩断了军隅里街内敌人的通路，一下子就缴获了十多辆满载武器弹药的汽车。勇士们插到敌人当中左右拼杀，强盗们跳上装甲汽车企图逃跑，孙二虎用机关枪瞄准装甲车上的敌人扫射，装甲汽车就载着死尸在街上东奔西撞，勇士们又用手榴弹追打。慌乱的敌人又开动两辆坦克妄图支援，战士单志有看见了，勇敢地端着步枪冲过去，美军坦克手发了慌，急忙调头逃跑。
    这时候，后续部队也赶上来了。三排的勇士们赶的满身大汗，直冲到镇上的街口，刚巧碰上了东头来的五辆汽车。机枪手胡德山不慌不忙，等汽车开近了就接连扫了两梭子子弹。敌人的头一辆弹药车，顿时乒乓乒乓爆炸起来，第二辆也起了火。胡德山和他的战友看见不远的地方，有个洋灰桥，他们想这是交通要道，不能让敌人从这里跑掉。他们跑过去把机枪架在桥头的大树下等着。这时只听得西头嗡隆嗡隆乱响，敌人的坦克开来了。胡德山就抖擞精神，抱着机枪猛扫，坦克冒着火焰、逃走不远就不动了。胡德山正打得高兴，忽然看见桥头二三十米远的地方，有四个大个子慌慌张张地跑来，胡德山暗叫：“来得正好”，便带着肖贵、李红庚迎上去捉俘虏。有一个大个子突然向胡德山扑来，两个人就摔起跤来，胡德山力气小，被大个子压在地上，肖贵急中生智，猛力夺过了那家伙的自动步枪，照准他后脊梁就是一击，那家伙一声惨叫，爬起来就跑。
    在这个夜里，军隅里到处响着枪声和手榴弹爆炸声，人民志愿军神勇的步兵，肃清着混乱了的昏头昏脑的敌人。在军隅里外围挖好了阵地的敌人的炮兵，竟不知向那里开炮，只好盲目向远处放了几炮，就仓惶逃走了。人民志愿军勇士们攻占了军隅里，街内敌尸狼籍，被打坏了的汽车和坦克在燃烧着。敌人屯集在镇上的所有的弹药库和面粉库，都原封不动地被我人民志愿军缴获。
