　　Beijing's Gengxin Middle School, Shengxin Boys' Middle School, Shengxin Girls' Middle School, Nantang Middle School, Tongde Advanced Nursing Vocational School, Youzhen Girls' Middle School, and Shangyi Middle School jointly issued a declaration supporting the government's "Policy Decision on Handling Cultural Education, Relief Agencies, and Religious Organizations Accepting American Subsidies." The declaration stated: Our Chinese people's mortal enemy, American imperialists, began political, economic, armed, and cultural aggression against China more than a century ago, with a special emphasis on cultural aggression. In addition to detesting the insidious aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism, we also realize that it is a great disgrace for our cultural and educational undertakings to be run by imperialism. To build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong New China, we resolutely support the government's wise decision, vow to sever all economic ties with U.S. imperialism, strive to develop patriotic education of New Democracy under the leadership of the government, and fight to crush the U.S. imperialists' vicious plot of cultural aggression, giving the U.S. imperialists a severe blow so that their cultural aggression and other forms of aggression suffer equally heavy failures.

　　京市七个私立天主教中学  宣言与美帝断绝关系
    【本报讯】京市耕莘中学、盛新男中、盛新女中、南堂中学、同德高级护士职业学校、佑贞女中、上义中学等七个私立天主教中学，联合发表宣言，拥护政府“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育，救济机关及宗教团体的方针决定”。该宣言称：我们中国人民的死敌美帝国主义者，早在百余年以前即开始向中国进行政治、经济、武装及文化侵略，并特别注重文化侵略。我们除痛恨美帝这种阴险的侵略行为外，同时觉悟到我们的文化教育等事业容忍由帝国主义来办，是一种很大的耻辱。为建设独立、民主、和平、统一富强的新中国，我们坚决拥护政府贤明的决定，誓与美帝断绝一切经济关系，在政府领导之下，为发展新民主主义的爱国教育而努力，并为粉碎美帝毒辣的文化侵略阴谋而奋斗，给美帝国主义者以严重的打击，使其文化侵略与其他侵略方式遭到同样惨重的失败。
