Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th - Christian figures in Nanjing have issued a declaration, warmly endorsing the Central People's Government Administration Council's policy decision on handling cultural, educational, relief organizations and religious bodies accepting American subsidies. The declaration states: After the brotherly forces of China and Korea inflicted significant blows on American imperialism on the Korean front, American imperialism brazenly announced the control of our country's public and private property in the United States and cut off remittances, attempting to increase the difficulties of our People's Government and threaten the lives of all Chinese personnel working in cultural, educational, relief organizations and religious bodies accepting American subsidies. This measure by American imperialism only makes us Christians more clearly recognize its true face of aggression. The Chinese people, who have already stood up, will never bow to it. In order to prevent the sabotage of American imperialism and to end the century-old cultural aggression of American imperialism against our country, the Central People's Government Administration Council's decision on handling cultural, educational, relief organizations and religious bodies accepting American subsidies is entirely necessary and correct. The declaration points out: The Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement declaration issued by our country's Christians last year is one hundred percent in line with the spirit of this decision. We call on all Christians in Nanjing to conscientiously study the Government Administration Council's decision, and in accordance with the spirit of this decision, combined with the specific circumstances of each church and religious organization, to draft specific plans for self-reliance under the leadership of the People's Government, and to support the Government Administration Council's decision with practical actions, and strive for its thorough realization!
The following 44 individuals jointly issued the declaration: Shao Jingsan (General Secretary of the National Christian Council of China), Shen Bangyan (District Superintendent of the Nanjing Methodist Church and Director of the City Central Church), Yang Dengying (Superintendent of the Reformed Church and Pastor of the Reformed Church), Zhu Pei'en (General Secretary of the YMCA), Kui Xiaohua (Chairman of the Sheng Kung Hui Tao Sheng Church and Principal of Tao Sheng Middle School), Li Ji'an (Pastor of the Quaker Ling En Church), Zheng Ruquan (General Secretary of the YWCA), Li Fangxun (Acting President of Ginling University), Wu Yifang (Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences of Ginling Women's College), Chen Zuyin (Director of Gulou Hospital), Zhu Jichang (Chairman of the Nanjing District Council of the Church of Christ in China and Pastor of Pei En Church), and others.

    拥护政务院决定
    号召各教堂、教会团体拟定具体的自立计划
    【新华社南京十四日电】南京市基督教人士发表宣言，热烈拥护中央人民政府政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定。该宣言称：中朝两国的兄弟部队在朝鲜前线连予美帝国主义以重大打击后，美帝国主义竟悍然宣布管制我国在美国的公私财产，并断绝汇兑，企图增加我人民政府的困难和威胁所有接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关和宗教团体中全部中国工作人员的生活。美帝国主义这种措施，只有使我们基督徒更清楚地认识它侵略的真面目。已经站立起来的中国人民决不会向它低头。为了防止美帝国主义的破坏，并且结束百余年美帝国主义对我国的文化侵略，中央人民政府政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关和宗教团体的决定是完全必要和正确的。宣言指出：我国基督徒去年发表的教会三自革新宣言，是百分之百地合乎这个决定的精神的。我们号召南京全市的基督徒认真学习政务院的决定，根据这个决定的精神，结合各教堂与教会团体的具体情况，在人民政府的领导下，拟定具体自立计划，以实际行动拥护政务院的决定，并为其彻底实现而奋斗！
    联名发表该宣言者：邵镜三（中华基督教总干事）、沈邦彦（卫理公会南京教区长兼城中会堂主任牧师）、杨登瀛（来复会监督兼来复会堂牧师）、诸培恩（基督教青年会总干事）、夔孝华（圣公会道胜堂会长兼道胜中学校长）、李既岸（贵格会灵恩堂牧师）、郑汝铨（基督教女青年会总干事）、李方训（金陵大学代理校长）、吴贻芳（金女大文理学院院长）、陈祖荫（鼓楼医院院长）、朱继昌（中华基督教会南京区会主席兼沛恩堂牧师）等四十四人。
