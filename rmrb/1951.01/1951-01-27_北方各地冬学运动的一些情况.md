Following the National First Conference on Workers’ and Peasants’ Education, all regions have reached a consensus on the significant meaning, principles, and steps of developing farmers' spare-time education. Therefore, the winter literacy movement in 1950 had a clearer and more specific guiding ideology and work plan. In just over a month from the beginning to now, the winter literacy movement in various parts of the country has achieved certain results.

(I) General Situation

Generally speaking, this year's winter literacy movement has received great attention from the leadership, who have been able to promptly arrange work, train teachers, and prepare teaching materials. For example, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government listed the winter literacy work as one of the central tasks for winter and conveyed it through enlarged cadre meetings, women's representative conferences, etc. At the province's 5,000-person labor model conference, the provincial chairman and the provincial party secretary both emphasized the importance of learning culture and presented each person with a set of literacy textbooks, calling on production models to also serve as learning models. The CPC Linfen Prefectural Committee instructed each county committee to actively run winter literacy classes, called on Party members and Youth League members to play a backbone role in the winter literacy movement, and required county and district cadres to go to the countryside as political teachers for winter literacy classes. The County Party Committee Propaganda Department should list the winter literacy movement situation as one of the important contents of monthly reports. The Hebei Baoding, Tangshan, and other special districts had many county heads who personally presided over winter literacy meetings. Pinggu and Zhao counties also proposed paying attention to the development of the winter literacy movement during the autumn grain collection and using the winter literacy movement to carry out the publicity and mobilization of autumn grain collection. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League also promptly issued instructions requiring Party members and Youth League members to actively run winter literacy classes and become learning models in the winter literacy movement themselves. Due to the importance attached by the leadership, this year's winter literacy movement has become a mass cultural emancipation movement.

In terms of training teachers, the Anyang Special District of Pingyuan Province alone, 48 counties and 3 towns in Hebei Province, and 52 counties and 1 city in Shanxi Province trained 27,905 mass teachers. Among the 28,100-plus winter literacy teachers in Heilongjiang Province, more than 10,800 participated in training. When training teachers in Rehe Province, district cultural and educational assistants and village cultural and educational committee members were also trained. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government allocated 26.75 million Mongolian currency as a special fund for each league and banner to train mass teachers.

The preparation of teaching materials was also relatively timely. The North China Joint Publishing House printed 2.8 million copies of farmers’ literacy textbooks (double the number of last year) for use in the North China region (excluding Shanxi). Zhejiang had sold 700,000 copies of farmers’ textbooks by early December last year, overcoming the past phenomenon of "untimely supply of teaching materials, insufficient quantity, and unaffordable prices."

Because various regions have implemented the principle of steady progress and put forward different requirements in a realistic manner according to the specific situation, this year's winter literacy movement is unprecedentedly large in scale, more down-to-earth, and easier to consolidate. For example, in Yushu County, Jilin Province, the winter literacy movement had developed to more than 166,000 people by the end of December last year, accounting for 25% of the county's total population. In the old revolutionary base area of Xingxian Special District, Shanxi Province, nine counties had opened 2,396 winter literacy classes by mid-November, accounting for 90.6% of the original plan. Village cadres and activists in Nanwa and Hewan villages in Wuzhai County have all enrolled in the classes. In the Weinan and Guanzhong sub-districts of Shaanxi Province, a total of 470,900 people have enrolled in winter literacy classes, exceeding the number of students in the entire province last year. In Zhuozhou County (disaster area) in Hebei Province, 135 villages have established winter literacy classes. In Minhe County, Qinghai Province, 5,042 people have signed up for winter literacy classes (including 1,021 women). According to the current situation, it is estimated that more than 20 million farmers across the country will be swept into the tide of learning in 1950.

Through the current affairs education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the vast number of farmers have set off a new upsurge of patriotism. Kou Shutian, a female student in Taikang Village, Bin County, Jilin Province, mobilized her husband to join the Volunteer Army, and Jiang Liying of Heping Township, Baoqing County, signed up to join the stretcher team. Xing Baosheng, a model student in Renhe Village, Jiaohe County, reported to the Central Ministry of Education: "Our village blackboard newspaper is changed every three days. There are four propagandists and six farmer teachers in the village. Village and township cadres have become the core of learning. When class starts in the evening, we read the newspaper for half an hour, and then teach cultural lessons. In addition, there are 18 newspaper reading groups. The masses are very interested in listening to current affairs. Nine students in this village have signed up to join the Volunteer Army, 41 have signed up to join the stretcher team, and 12 rubber-wheeled carts and 16 iron-wheeled carts have requested to go to the front to work on transportation." In the South Jiangsu area, hundreds of thousands of people held demonstrations and parades, and formulated conventions to ensure the rapid completion of the autumn grain collection task. For example, Dafu Village in Wuxi paid all 31,000 kilograms of public grain into the warehouse in two days; farmers in Biqiao District, Liyang, voluntarily handed over the enemy's remaining military supplies. In Chuansha County, 148 young and middle-aged people signed up to join the county militia brigade to expand local armed forces. Students in Xiafu Village, North Piao, Rehe, often went to the market to publicize to people attending the market, arousing a psychological state of hatred, contempt, and disdain for U.S. imperialism among the masses.

(II) Issues that Should Be Noted

First, the issue of cadres and activists taking the lead in participating in winter literacy classes. According to the feedback from Hebei Province, cadres have three "mores" (more meetings, more tasks, and more concurrent positions), which affects their learning time. Meetings should be streamlined as much as possible, and concurrent positions should be reduced as much as possible. Meetings should be well prepared in advance to solve problems in the shortest possible time. In villages where winter literacy classes are run well, village cadres participate in learning, ring the bell for class, and hold meetings after class, which is more economical in terms of time. Cadres are advanced elements among the masses and leaders of mass movements. The phenomena of "taking the lead in meetings but not taking the lead in learning" and "thinking that the responsibility is fulfilled by taking students to school" must be overcome. In fact, many learning models are also production models and work models. If learning is not done well, the level of culture is not improved, one cannot take notes when listening to reports, one cannot understand newspaper news, and one cannot often absorb good work experience, it is not easy to do a good job. Everything must proceed from reality, and the learning requirements for elderly cadres should naturally be different. Now many county and district cadres have been swept into the upsurge of learning culture, which provides favorable conditions for promoting village cadres to learn culture from top to bottom. As long as attention is paid to leadership, the psychology of village cadres who are unwilling to learn with the masses can be overcome.

Second, current affairs education should continue to be strengthened to constantly inspire the patriotic thinking of the masses. Although current affairs education has achieved great results, it has not been universally carried out from the perspective of the vast rural areas across the country. Generally speaking, the Northeast has done better in this regard, followed by North China and coastal provinces. Winter literacy classes are an important place for conducting current affairs education for farmers, and winter literacy students are the core of promoting current affairs education. Through propagandists, lecturers, and political teachers, work on reading newspapers in winter literacy classes should be strengthened, and living materials from newspapers should be used to educate the masses. The main news and general news in the newspapers should be explained succinctly. For various war zone reports with literary, storytelling, and flesh-and-blood characteristics, they should be explained in more detail. Now that winter vacation has arrived, tens of thousands of college, middle, and elementary school students will be leaving school and returning home. Schools and county and district leaders should organize and use this force well, use various methods to make the current affairs education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea universally penetrate into the vast rural areas.

Third, strengthen tutoring work, improve the quality of mass teachers, consolidate teaching results, and lay the foundation for permanent people's schools. Generally, the quality of mass teachers is low, and they need constant help. For example, 81% of the existing mass teachers in Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province, have an education level below junior elementary school. Therefore, in addition to requiring current elementary school teachers in local villages to regularly help prepare lessons, county and district leaders must also focus on tutoring and inspection work, and timely introduce successful experiences and failures lessons. This is of great help to promote work. The Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education has organized a work team of more than 20 people to conduct key experimental inspection work in Laiyang Special District. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education has compiled more than 40 students from the culture and education training class into three teams to conduct winter literacy work inspections in Yucheng, Linfen Special Districts and the suburbs of Taiyuan City. Yucheng Special District recently decided to implement unified leadership and unified planning and methods of instruction at the county and district levels: village-level elementary school teachers, mass teachers, village cadres, etc. form mutual learning assistance groups to jointly study current affairs issues and then retrain winter literacy students; with central elementary schools, etc. as the base, mass teachers from neighboring villages are convened to inspect their work and answer questions in teaching; more difficult problems are reflected to the county, and the county issues loose-leaf teaching materials to provide unified answers. Songjiang Province has achieved good results through literacy correspondence to commend models and guide work. All regions must seize this work, make good use of the winter slack time to run winter literacy classes well, consolidate the learning confidence of farmers, and prepare for the transition to permanent people's schools.

　　北方各地冬学运动的一些情况
    项国
    全国第一次工农教育会议之后，各地对开展农民业余教育的重要意义、方针和步骤，都有了一致的认识。因此，一九五○年的冬学运动，在领导思想上和工作计划上，都进一步明确、具体起来。从开始到现在，仅仅一个多月的时间，全国各地的冬运都收到了一定的成绩。
  （一）一般情况
    今年冬学，一般说来，领导上都很重视，能及时布置工作，集训教师，准备教材。如山西省人民政府把冬学工作列为冬季中心工作之一，并通过扩大干部会、妇代大会等作了传达布置。在全省五千人的劳模大会上，省主席和省委书记都强调提出学习文化的重要性，并每人赠给识字课本一套，号召生产模范兼作学习模范。中共临汾地委指示各县委要积极办好冬学，号召党团员在冬学中起骨干带头作用，县区干部要下乡作冬学的政治教员，县委宣传部应将冬运情况列为每月汇报重要内容之一。河北保定、唐山等专区有不少县长亲自主持冬运会议。平谷、赵县并提出在秋征中要注意开展冬运，通过冬运进行秋征的宣传动员。山东省团工委也及时地发出指示，要求党团员积极办好冬学，并使自己成为冬学中的学习模范。由于领导上的重视，才使今年的冬学运动成为群众性的文化翻身运动。
    在集训教师方面，仅平原省安阳一个专区，河北省四十八县三个镇，山西省五十二县一个市，就训练群众教师二七、九○五名。黑龙江省二万八千一百多名冬学教师中，即有一万零八百余人参加集训。热河省在训练教师时，并集训了区文教助理员，村文教委员。内蒙自治区人民政府拨出蒙币二六七五○万元，作为各盟旗集训群众教师的专款。
    教材准备亦比较及时。华北联合出版社印出农民识字课本二八○万册（较去年增加一倍），供给华北区使用（不包括山西），浙江在去年十二月初已售出农民课本七十万册，克服了过去“教材供给不及时，数量不够用，价钱不便宜”的现象。
    由于各个地区贯彻了稳步前进的方针，并实事求是地按照具体情况提出了不同的要求，今年冬学的规模是空前的巨大，而且更踏实，更容易巩固。如吉林省榆树县冬学，据去年十二月底统计已发展到十六万六千余人，占全县总人口百分之二十五。老区山西兴县专区九个县在十一月中旬已开办冬学二三九六座，占原计划数百分之九十点六。五寨县南窊，河湾两村的村干部积极分子都入了学。陕西省渭南、关中两分区，共有四七○九○○人入了冬学，超过了去年全省学员的数字。河北省涿县（灾区），有一三五个村成立了冬学。青海省民和县也有五○四二人报名上冬学（内中有妇女一○二一人）。根据现在的情况估计，一九五○年全国有两千万以上的农民卷到学习的热潮中去。
    通过抗美援朝的时事教育，广大的农民掀起了爱国主义的新高潮。吉林省宾县太康村女学员寇淑田动员自己丈夫参加了志愿军，宝清县和平乡姜丽英报名参加了担架队。蛟河县仁和村模范学员邢宝升向中央教育部报告说：“我村黑板报三天准换一次，全村有四个宣传员，六个农民教师，村屯干部成为学习的核心，晚上上课时先读报半小时，再讲文化课。另外还有十八个读报组。群众听时事的兴趣很高。本村学员有九名报名参加志愿军，四十一人报名参加担架队，十二辆胶轮车、十六辆铁轮车要求到前方作运输工作。”苏南区成千成万的人，举行了示威游行，并纷纷定出公约，保证迅速完成秋征任务。如无锡大浮村在两天中把三万一千斤公粮全部缴清入库；溧阳甓桥区农民，自动交出敌人遗留下来的军火。川沙县有一四八名青壮年报名参加县大队，扩大了地方武装。热河北票下府村的学员经常到集市上向赶集的人宣传，引起了广大群众对美帝仇视鄙视蔑视的心理。
  （二）应该注意的几个问题
    首先是干部和积极分子带头参加冬学问题。根据河北省的反映，干部有三多（开会多、任务多、兼职多），因而影响了学习的时间。应该尽可能精简会议，尽可能减少兼职。开会事前要有充分准备，争取在最短时间内解决问题。冬学办的好的村庄，村干部参加学习，打钟上课，下课开会，时间比较经济。干部是群众中的先进分子，是群众运动的带头人。对“开会带头，学习不带头”和“把学员带到学校去就算尽了责任”的现象，必须加以克服。事实上，有好多学习模范也是生产模范，又是工作模范。学习搞不好，文化程度不提高，听报告不能记笔记，报纸消息看不懂，无法经常吸收好的工作经验，就不容易作好工作。一切要从实际出发，对老年干部的学习要求，自应有所不同。现在有不少的县区干部，已卷入学习文化的热潮，具备了自上而下推动村干部学习文化的有利条件，只要注意领导，村干部不愿和群众一道学习的心理，是能够克服的。
    第二，应该继续加强时事教育，不断启发群众的爱国主义思想。时事教育虽然已取得了很大的成绩，但从全国广大乡村来看，还开展的不普遍，一般的说，东北在这方面做得较好，其次是华北以及沿海各个省份。冬学是对农民进行时事教育的重要场所，冬学学员是推行时事教育的核心，要通过宣传员、讲读员、政治教员等，在冬学中加强讲报的工作，用报纸上活生生的材料教育群众。对于报纸上的要闻和一般消息，要扼要的加以说明。而对于各种带有文艺性、故事性、有血有肉的战地报导，应该讲得比较详细些。现在寒假到了，成千成万的大、中、小学生就要离校回家了，学校和县区领导上，要很好的组织和使用这批力量，运用各种各样的方法，把抗美援朝的时事教育，普遍深入到广大的农村中去。
    第三，加强辅导工作，提高群众教师质量，巩固教学成绩，为常年民校打下基础。一般群众教师质量低，需要经常有人帮助。如山西省长治专区现有的群众教师，初小以下程度的达百分之八十一。因此，除要求当地村庄的现任小学教师经常帮助准备功课外，县区领导上还要有重点的进行辅导和检查工作，把成功的经验和失败的教训，及时加以介绍，这对于推动工作有很大的作用。山东文教厅已组织了二十多人的工作组到莱阳专区作重点的实验检查工作，山西省文教厅把文教训练班学员四十余人编成三个队，到榆次、临汾两专区和太原市郊进行冬运的视导工作。榆次专区最近决定以县区为单位，统一领导、统一计划传授办法：村级由小学教员、群众教师、村干部等成立学习互助小组，共同研究时事问题后，再去转教冬学学员；以中心小学等为基点，召集邻近村的群众教师检查工作，解答教学中的问题；较难解决的问题则反映到县，由县印发活页教材，作统一的解答。松江省通过识字通讯表扬模范，指导工作，效果很好。各地都须要抓紧这一工作，利用冬闲时间，把冬学办好，巩固农民的学习信心，为转入常年民校准备条件。
