　　Record of the Annihilation of the Turkish Brigade
　　By our reporter Tan Wenrui
　　Turkey is a country in the Near East. Its reactionary ruling class has always been willing to act as an accomplice of aggressors. In World War II, it served as a minion of Hitler's army, and after the war, it became a pawn of American imperialism in suppressing national liberation movements. In order to meet the needs of the American master in its aggressive war against Korea and to collect cannon fodder from its vassal states, the Turkish government sent an infantry brigade of 5,000 men to Korea to serve as a pawn for the American invading army. As a result, they were routed by our People's Volunteer Army in the first battle, and many Turkish soldiers became the burial objects of the American invaders.
　　On November 25, 1950, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched a counter-offensive on the entire front in order to crush MacArthur's so-called "general offensive" aimed at occupying the entire Korean Peninsula. The enemy's entire line quickly faltered, and the U.S. Ninth Corps, in order to cover the retreat of the defeated U.S. forces, transferred the Turkish Brigade to serve as scapegoats.
　　The Turkish Brigade arrived in Jiachuan on the 28th. At dawn the next day, it dispatched a so-called reinforced company in more than 20 trucks, heading straight for the summit of Gajiri Pass to the southeast, along a winding mountain road dozens of miles long, in an attempt to control this dangerous mountain ridge, which was thousands of feet high, and prevent our army from pursuing the defeated enemy southwards. Unexpectedly, the vanguard of our Volunteer Army also arrived at the ridge on this very morning. On the precipitous cliffs of the mountain, our Volunteer Army engaged in an encounter battle with this company of Turkish soldiers. In one engagement, this group of mercenary soldiers was defeated, eliminating fifty or sixty men, and the rest fled in disarray, rolling down the mountain. That day, Jiachuan was surrounded by our army.
　　The Turkish soldiers were panicked after being hit head-on. On the morning of December 1, the thousands of Turkish soldiers in Jiachuan, in more than 100 trucks, fled in a hurry towards Junyuli. They suffered heavy casualties as they were resisted by our army along the way. At the same time, another unit of our Volunteer Army had inserted itself into the enemy's flanks and rear, intercepting the fleeing Turkish Brigade and the remnant of the U.S. Second Division on the two highways from Jiachuan to Junyuli and from Jiachuan to Sansuoli, respectively, and annihilating them. The soldiers of the Turkish Brigade had to find a way to escape for their own lives while also covering the retreat of the American army. After a day and night of battle, the mountains were covered with the corpses of Turkish soldiers wearing star and crescent insignias. More than 1,000 trucks (including those of the American army) were left behind on the highway. Except for the brigade commander leading more than 2,000 remnants out of the encirclement, the Turkish Brigade was completely routed, and hundreds of them were captured by our army.
　　After the Turkish soldiers who laid down their weapons were captured, they opened their mouths and asked for food. Some took out raw corn from their coat pockets and peeled it to eat. The mercenary soldiers could not eat the canned food of the young American masters. Although they were loyal, they were inevitably discriminated against by their masters. Their lives were even more worthless, and in times of crisis, they were used as shields for the American soldiers. Therefore, these ignorant Turkish soldiers were very happy after being captured. When we distributed the captured Turkish cigarettes to them, they showed infinite gratitude. Some prisoners gesticulated to indicate: "These cigarettes could only be smoked by our officers before."
　　The annihilation of the Turkish Brigade illustrates the tragic fate of being an accomplice of the American invaders. That is, the punishment suffered by the accomplices will not be lighter than that of their masters. On the contrary, because they are often used as shields by the American invaders, they become cannon fodder sooner.

　　土耳其旅就歼记
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    土耳其是近东的一个国家。它的反动统治阶级一向甘于当侵略者的帮凶。在第二次世界大战中，它曾当过希特勒军队的喽啰，战后就成?嗣赖酃?饕宸此盏纳诒?Ｕ庖淮蚊拦?诜⒍?致猿?实恼秸?螅?蚋?仆从国搜罗炮灰，土耳其政府又派了一个五千人的步兵旅到朝鲜，充当美国侵略军的马前卒。结果，在第一仗中就被我人民志愿军击溃，许多土耳其士兵变成了美国侵略者的陪葬品。
    一九五○年十一月二十五日，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为了粉碎麦克阿瑟企图侵占全朝鲜的所谓“总攻势”，在全线发动反攻。敌军全线迅速动摇，美军第九兵团为了要掩护溃败的美军撤退，便把土耳其旅调来作替死鬼。
    土耳其旅在二十八日开到价川。第二天拂晓，就派出一个所谓加强连，乘着二十多辆卡车，沿着蜿蜒数十里的山路，直奔驻地东南戛日岭的顶峰，企图控制这一高达千尺的险峻山岭，阻止我军向南追击溃敌。没有料到我志愿军的先头部队也在这一个清晨进抵该岭。就在悬崖峭壁的山上，我志愿军与这一连土耳其兵展开了遭遇战。一个回合，就击溃了这一群仆从兵，消灭五、六十人，其余的狼狈逃窜，滚下山去。当天，价川就被我军包围了。
    土耳其兵挨了当头一棒后，惊慌失措。十二月一日上午，在价川的数千土耳其兵，乘着一百多辆卡车，慌忙向军隅里方面逃命。一路受到我军的阻击，伤亡惨重。同时，我志愿军另部已插入敌人的侧后，把溃逃的土耳其旅与美军第二师的歼部截在价川至军隅里及价川至三所里的两条公路上，分别聚歼。土耳其旅的士兵，一面要设法自己逃命，一面还要掩护美军撤退，经过一昼夜的战斗，满山遍野都是戴着星月帽徽的土耳其士兵的尸体，公路上，遗下一千多辆卡车（包括美军的），除旅长带领着两千多名残兵逃出重围外，土耳其旅全部被击溃，被我军俘掳的就有好几百人。
    放下武器的土耳其兵在被俘后，就张着嘴巴要东西吃。有的从大衣口袋里掏出生的苞米来剥食，仆从兵是吃不上美国少爷兵的罐头的，虽然忠心耿耿，还是不免受到主子的歧视。他们的性命更是不值钱，在危急的时候，要替美国兵做挡箭牌。所以这些被愚昧的土耳其兵在被俘后，都很高兴。当我们把缴获的土耳其纸烟分发给他们抽的时候，他们流露出无限的感激，有些俘虏作手势表示说：“这些纸烟，以前只有我们的长官才能抽。”
    土耳其旅的被歼，说明了作为美国侵略者的帮凶的悲惨命运。那就是帮凶者所受到的惩罚，并不会比他们的主子轻些。相反地，他们由于往往被美国侵略者利用做挡箭牌，更早地变成了炮灰。
