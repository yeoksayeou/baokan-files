　　Methods for Propagandists to Influence the Masses
　　Zheng Yuan

　　A good propagandist should use the Party's propositions to influence the masses around them at all times and in all places. They should not only speak in simple, clear language that the masses can understand, but more importantly, the content of every sentence should reflect the reality of the masses' lives and thoughts, truly touching the hearts of the people. When everyone hears it, they can be immediately encouraged to prepare to take action.

　　Being able to deeply influence the masses and establish ideological prestige among the masses around oneself should be the goal of every propagandist's struggle.

　　Comrade Stalin said: "The method of persuasion is the basic method for the Party to lead its class." The basic method for the Party to lead the masses is not through administrative orders but through mass work. The basic method of mass work is propaganda, mobilization, persuasion, and explanation. Propaganda is not empty talk, but it must be effective. One propaganda effort should influence several or dozens of people, causing changes in their thoughts and actions.

　　One of the propaganda arts of Communists towards the people is to be good at selecting typical examples from the masses' thoughts and lives to illustrate the correctness of the Party's propositions, in order to guide and raise the masses' thinking to the level of the Party's policies. Regarding this point, Lenin put forward a very important method. In his book "What Is To Be Done?" Lenin required agitators to "cite the most familiar and prominent examples for all listeners" when conducting propaganda. He said: "For example, the family of a certain unemployed worker starved to death, the increase in poverty, and other facts, and make great use of these well-known facts to give the masses the idea that the contradictory situation of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer is completely unreasonable, and to arouse the masses' resentment and dissatisfaction with this extremely unfair situation." In December 1912, in his article "On Slogans and the Presentation of the Social Democrats' Work Inside and Outside the State Duma," Lenin also mentioned this issue, saying: "At open-air meetings in factories, at student gatherings, and in peasants' houses, one must not speak in a uniform manner what one has heard from the platform of the Third State Duma and read in newspapers published abroad. The art of any propagandist and agitator lies in influencing the masses on the spot with the best examples." What are the "best examples"? According to Lenin's explanation, they are called "truths familiar to the masses." This kind of propaganda, which combines the truth from the masses that is familiar to the masses with the overall truth of the Party leading the masses, will surely play a role in encouraging and organizing the masses.

　　Looking at how Comrade Mao Zedong popularly uses examples from the masses to explain major issues will directly help improve the propaganda art of propagandists. For example, in 1943, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech entitled "On Cooperatives" at a meeting of high-ranking cadres in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. This was an important document of historical significance. In this speech, he explained that destroying feudal exploitation relations was the first revolution, and using the cooperative method to organize public and private labor forces, mobilizing the masses' productivity, improving labor efficiency, and greatly developing production, creating a revolution in the production system, was the second revolution. When explaining this profound theory, Comrade Mao Zedong cited the experience of organizing agricultural production in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region at that time. He said: "Now, according to the experience of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, general mutual-aid labor is equivalent to three people for two, and model mutual-aid labor is equivalent to two people for one, or even more than two people for one. If the labor force of all the people is organized into collective mutual-aid labor, then the existing productivity of the entire border region can be increased by 50% to 100%. This method can be applied to all anti-Japanese base areas and will be applied to the whole country in the future." Here, Comrade Mao Zedong closely combined the truth familiar to the peasants in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other liberated areas at that time with the overall task of the rural revolution after the land reform, so that people immediately had a sense of intimacy and a deep and significant impression of the Party's policies, and at the same time, they naturally considered how to take concrete action.

　　Comrade Stalin's famous story of the Yenisei River fisherman is also a model that every propagandist should study well. Comrade Stalin said: "Have you ever seen fishermen on a large river, such as the Yenisei River, encountering strong winds and waves? I have seen them many times. There are some fishermen who, when they encounter strong winds and waves, mobilize all their strength, encourage their hearts, and boldly row their boats against the wind and waves: 'Brothers, don't be weak, hold on to the rudder, and forge ahead, we will definitely win!' And other fishermen, when they hear of strong winds and waves, become discouraged and complain endlessly, demoralizing their entire team: 'What bad luck, the storm is coming, brothers, lie on the deck, close your eyes, maybe we can be lucky enough to get to the shore.'" In this typical picture, Comrade Stalin depicts the finest qualities that a Communist Party member should possess, pointing out what kind of attitude a Communist Party member should have towards the difficulties placed before them, and at the same time giving a devastating critique to the timid. The story of the Yenisei River fisherman is a universal truth in the struggle of the masses' lives. Comrade Stalin used it to illustrate the qualities of a Communist Party member, educating all revolutionary comrades, making them believe that they must resolutely overcome any difficulties and obstacles on the road to their goal, rather than retreating and giving up their positions in the face of difficulties. Difficulties exist to be overcome.

　　Now, Party organizations across the country are implementing the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to establish a propaganda network for the people, and propagandists in various places have been and are being established. Strengthening the education of propagandists and establishing a good working style for all Party propagandists from the beginning is very urgent at present. The content of education, in addition to the Party's basic policies and current tasks, should also help propagandists correctly grasp the propaganda art of Communists. Propagandists should understand that propaganda is an extremely serious work responsible to the people, and that propaganda is a decisive link in the Party's leadership of the masses towards action. Therefore, they should never think that it is enough to simply convey the various propositions of the Party that they have heard and seen to the masses verbatim. No, propagandists must be very familiar with the lives and thoughts of the people, discover various advanced examples of the people's lives, and at the same time pay attention to various erroneous tendencies. Then, they must combine the Party's propositions with the specific tasks of the local area at the time, unify the truths most familiar to the masses with the Party's propositions, and "come from the masses and go to the masses." Using this method to carry out propaganda to the masses can avoid the shortcomings of empty and boring "propaganda for propaganda's sake," and propagandists can become the most active activists in the political life of the masses. The Party's propaganda network can truly become an important bridge connecting the Party and the masses.

　　宣传员影响群众的方法
    郑远
    一个好的宣传员，随时随地都要用党的主张去影响自己周围的群众，他不但要说简单、明白，为群众所懂得的语言，更重要的还要使每一句话的内容都反映出群众生活的和思想的实际，真正能够打入群众的心坎里，大家听了，便能够立即鼓舞起来准备投入行动。
    能够深刻地影响群众，能够在自己周围群众中建立思想威信，这应是每一个宣传员奋斗的目标。
    斯大林同志说：“说服的方法是党领导本阶级的基本方法”，党领导群众的基本方法不是靠行政命令而是靠群众工作。群众工作的基本方法就是宣传动员和说服解释。宣传不是说空话，而要讲求效果，作一次宣传，就要影响几个人几十个人，使他们思想和行动发生变化。
    共产党员对人民群众宣传艺术之一，就是要善于从群众思想与生活中选择标本的例子来说明党的主张的正确性，以便引导并提高群众思想到党的政策水平。关于这一点，列宁曾提出过一个很重要的方法，列宁在《做什么》一书中要求鼓动员在进行宣传时要“举出全体听众所最熟悉和最显著的例子。”他说：“譬如某某失业工人家属饿死，贫困增加等等事实，并极力利用人所共知的这件事实来给予群众一个观念，即富者愈富和贫者愈贫的矛盾情形毫不合理的观念，并极力激起群众对这种极不公平情形，愤恨不满的心理”。一九一二年十二月列宁在其《论口号与社会民主党在国家杜马内外工作的提法》一文中同样也提到这一个问题，他说：“在工厂露天大会上，在大学生的集会上和在农民的房子里绝不能把从第三届国家杜马讲台上听来的和从国外出版的机关报纸上读来的，千篇一律地去讲。任何一个宣传员和鼓动员的艺术就在于能以最好的例子影响当场的群众”。什么是“最好的例子”？按照列宁的解释，叫做“群众熟悉的真理”，这种从群众中来的为群众所熟悉的真理同党领导群众的全面真理合在一起的宣传，就一定能起鼓舞群众以及组织群众的作用。
    看一看毛泽东同志如何通俗地运用从群众中来的例子说明重大问题，对于提高宣传员的宣传艺术会是有直接帮助的。举一个例子来说：一九四三年毛泽东同志在陕甘宁边区高干会上发表了一篇《论合作社》的讲话，这是一个有历史意义的重要文件。在这篇讲话里，他说明了破坏封建剥削关系是第一个革命，而用合作社方式，把公私劳动力组织起来，发动群众生产性，提高劳动效率，大大发展生产，造成生产制度的革命，这是第二个革命。毛泽东同志在解释这一深刻的理论时，他引用了当时的陕甘宁边区农业生产组织起来的经验，他说：“现在陕甘宁边区经验，一般的变工扎工劳动是二人可抵三人，模范的变工扎工劳动是一人可抵二人，甚至二人以上。如果全体人民的劳动力都组织在集体互助劳动之中，那末现有全边区的生产力就可以提高到百分之五十到百分之一百。这办法可以行之于各抗日根据地，将来可以行之于全国”。在这里，毛泽东同志把陕甘宁边区和当时解放区的农民所熟悉的真理同土地改革后农村革命的总任务紧密结合起来，使人们听了，立刻对于党的政策、便有了亲切的感觉和深刻显著的印象，同时也就自然而然地考虑到如何具体地行动了。
    斯大林同志有名的叶尼塞河渔夫的故事，同样是每一个宣传员都应当很好学习的范例，斯大林同志说道：“你们看见过大河中间，比方叶尼塞河这样一条大河中间遇见大风浪时的渔夫么？我看见过他们多次。有一种渔夫遇见大风浪到来时，就动员自己所有的力量，鼓励自己的人心，大胆冒着风浪划船：‘弟兄们，不要软劲，努力抓着舵，破浪前进吧，我们是一定会胜利的！’而另一种渔夫闻见大风浪，就灰心丧气，叫苦连天，使自己所有的队伍的精神颓废：‘真倒霉呀，大风浪来了，弟兄们，卧在船板底下，闭着眼睛，也许可以侥幸挨得到岸边去的。’”斯大林同志在这一幅典型的图景中描绘出一个共产党员应具备的最优秀的品质，指出共产党员对摆在面前的困难应抱有一个什么样的态度，同时也给胆怯者以毁灭性的批评。叶尼塞河渔夫的故事是群众生活斗争中一个普遍真理，斯大林同志用它来说明了共产党员的品质，教育了所有的革命同志，使他们坚信：要坚决克服走向目的的道路上的任何困难和障碍，而不是在困难面前退却让出阵地，困难是为着要克服才存在。
    现在全国各地党的组织正在执行中共中央建立向人民群众的宣传网的决定，各地的宣传员已经和正在设立。加强对宣传员的教育工作使全党宣传员一开始就建立一个良好的工作作风，在目前是非常迫切的。教育的内容，除了党的基本政策和当前任务外，还要帮助宣传员正确地掌握共产党人的宣传艺术。宣传员应当了解：宣传是一件极端严肃的对人民负责的工作，宣传是党领导群众走向行动的决定一环，因此，绝不要以为只把听到的和看到的党的各种主张，原封不动地一字一句向群众传达就够了。不是的，宣传员必须要十分熟悉人民群众的生活和思想，发现人民生活中各式各样先进的标本的例子，同时也要注意各种错误的倾向，然后把党的主张和当地当时的具体任务结合起来，把群众最熟悉的真理，和党的主张统一起来，“从群众中来，到群众中去”，用这样方法来向群众宣传，才能使政治宣传避免空洞乏味的“为宣传而宣传”的毛病，宣传员才有可能成为群众政治生活中最活动的积极分子。党的宣传网才能真正成为党与群众联系的重要桥梁。
