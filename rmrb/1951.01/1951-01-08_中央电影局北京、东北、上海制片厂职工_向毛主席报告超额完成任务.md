　　Employees of the Central Film Bureau's Beijing, Northeast, and Shanghai Film Studios
    Report to Chairman Mao on Overfulfilling Production Quotas
    [This newspaper's report] On the eve of the New Year, all employees of the Beijing, Northeast, and Shanghai Film Studios under the Central People's Government's Ministry of Culture's Film Bureau reported to Chairman Mao on overfulfilling their annual production quotas. The Beijing Film Studio produced five feature films throughout the year (the original plan was four), seventeen documentary and educational films (originally sixteen), fifty New China Briefings (originally thirty-four), and translated forty-two educational short films (originally thirty-six). The Northeast Film Studio's output in one year exceeded the total production of the past four years, producing thirteen feature films depicting the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as economic construction and stories of the Liberation War, and translated thirty Soviet films with educational significance. After the start of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, it also overfulfilled the translation of the Soviet films "Secret Mission" and "Conspiracy," which exposed imperialist war-mongering. The Shanghai Film Studio produced eight feature films, one art film (including two animated films and one puppet film), eleven translated films, one large-scale documentary, six documentary short films, and thirteen newsreels throughout the year (the original task was twenty films and twelve newsreels). These films not only educated and encouraged the people of the whole country domestically and defeated reactionary British and American films but also enabled the young people's cinema to gain a certain honor internationally. However, the employees of the three factories are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. They stated that they will always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "remaining modest and prudent, guarding against arrogance and rashness," work together, fully prepare their strength, and greet the new tasks of 1951 with greater efforts.

　　中央电影局北京、东北、上海制片厂职工
    向毛主席报告超额完成任务
    【本报讯】新年前夕，中央人民政府文化部电影局所属北京、东北、上海三电影制片厂全体职工，向毛主席报告超额完成全年生产任务情况。北京电影制片厂全年生产故事片五部（原计划是四部）、纪录与教育片十七部（原订十六部），新中国简报五十号（原订三十四号）、翻译教育短片四十二本（原订三十六本）。东北电影制片厂一年中超过了过去四年的生产总额，摄制十三部描写工农兵生活及经济建设，与解放战争的故事片，翻译了三十部富有教育意义的苏联影片。抗美援朝运动开始后，又超额译制了揭露帝国主义制造战争的苏联影片《秘密使节》与《阴谋》。上海电影制片厂一年中制作了八部故事片、一部美术片（包括二个动画片和一个木偶片）、十一部翻译片、一个大型纪录片、六个纪录短片和十三个新闻简报（原订任务为影片二十部、简报十二个）。这些影片不仅在国内教育鼓舞了全国人民，打垮了反动的英美影片，并使年轻的人民电影，在国际上获得一定荣誉。但是，三厂职工并不满足于已得的成绩。他们表示将永远记住毛主席的教导“不骄不躁”，通力合作，充分准备力量，以更大的努力迎接一九五一年的新任务。
