China Zhi Gong Party Issues Statement
Supporting the Control and Investigation of US Assets

[Xinhua News Agency, 2nd] The China Zhi Gong Party issued a statement supporting the two measures taken by the Government Administration Council regarding the handling of American assets. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On December 28th, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued an order deciding that local people's governments should control and investigate all assets of the US government and American enterprises within China, and freeze all public and private American deposits in all banks within China. On the 29th, the Government Administration Council's political affairs meeting also passed a decision regarding the policy for handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups accepting American subsidies. These are all correct decisions that fully represent the will of the Chinese people; at the same time, they are an effective counterattack against the barbaric acts of aggression by American imperialism.

For over a century, American imperialists in China have consistently engaged in military, political, and economic aggression, and have coordinated this with a hypocritical appearance, using a very small portion of the loot they plundered from the Chinese people to run some schools, libraries, hospitals, and other relief organizations in China, attempting to win the favor of the Chinese people. In reality, they are carrying out extremely insidious enslavement education on the Chinese people, spreading the poisonous ideas of being pro-American, worshiping America, and fearing America, in order to facilitate the implementation of their aggression plans. This is a bloodless cultural aggression. However, on November 28th, the American imperialist Austin brazenly and shamelessly referred to this act of aggression as "America's traditional friendship with China" at the United Nations Security Council, feigning concern for Chinese culture and education. Such shameless nonsense cannot deceive the Chinese people who have stood up today.

Although American imperialism has suffered defeat in its war of aggression against Korea, it still refuses to repent and has resorted to tactics such as freezing our assets in the United States, attempting to threaten the lives of personnel in churches, schools, hospitals, and other institutions that accept American subsidies. This shameless measure further exposes its true robber-like face.

Our party is well aware of the various crimes committed by American imperialists against our overseas Chinese in their own country, and now expresses great indignation at the shameless measures of American imperialism. We fully support the two measures of our Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and are willing to work hard to realize the glorious task proposed by Vice Premier Guo of "finally, permanently, thoroughly, and completely ending the cultural aggression of American imperialism against the Chinese people for over a century."

　　中国致公党发表声明
    拥护管制清查美财产
    【新华社二日讯】中国致公党发表声明，拥护政务院对于处理美国财产的两项措施。声明全文如下：
    十二月二十八日，中央人民政府政务院发布命令，决定由各地人民政府管制及清查美国政府和美国企业在我国境内的一切财产，冻结我国境内所有银行的一切美国公私存款。二十九日，政务院政务会议又通过了关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定。这都是完全代表了我国人民的意志的正确决定；同时，也是对美帝国主义横蛮侵略行为的有效回击。
    百余年来，美帝国主义者在中国一贯肆行军事、政治、经济侵略，并配合着假慈悲的外貌，使用它从中国人民身上掠夺去的赃物的极小部分，在中国办了一些学校、图书馆、医院及其他救济机关，企图骗取中国人民的好感，实际上在对中国人民施行极恶毒的奴化教育，传播亲美、崇美、恐美的恶毒思想，以便利它侵略计划的施行。这是一种杀人不见血的文化侵略。可是十一月二十八日美帝国主义者奥斯汀，竟在联合国安全理事会上公然把这种侵略罪行，厚颜无耻的称之为“美国对中国的传统友谊”，伪装出一副关心中国文化教育的假面目。这种无耻谰言欺骗不了今天已经站起来了的中国人民。
    美帝国主义虽然在其侵朝战争中遭受失败，但仍不知改悔，竟采取了冻结我国在美财产等伎俩，企图威胁那些接受美国津贴的教会、学校、医院等机关中的人员的生活，这种无耻措施，更暴露了它本来的强盗面目。
    本党对于美帝国主义者在其本国压迫我侨胞之种种罪行，知之甚详，今更对于美帝国主义的无耻措施，表示极大的愤慨。我们完全拥护我中央人民政府政务院的两项措施，并愿为实现郭副总理所提出的“把百余年来美国帝国主义对中国人民的文化侵略，最后地、永远地、彻底地、全部地加以结束”的光荣任务而努力。
