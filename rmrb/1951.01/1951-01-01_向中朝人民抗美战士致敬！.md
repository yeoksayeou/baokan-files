    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation jointly wrote a letter on the 27th to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front, expressing warm congratulations and condolences.

    To the heroic soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    All the youths, Youth League members, and students of China warmly congratulate you on the great victories you have achieved in the war to resist America and aid Korea.
    Your victory, together with the Korean People's Army, has reversed the serious military situation on the Korean battlefield, crushed the arrogant plans of American imperialism to conquer Korea, invade China, and enslave Asia, and created extremely favorable conditions for the liberation struggles of the people of Asian countries and the people of all countries in the world.
    Your victory, together with the Korean people, has proven to the people of Asia and the world that American imperialism is a paper tiger and can be defeated completely. It also proves that wars of aggression can be stopped, and peace must be won through practical actions.
    The youths, Youth League members, and students of China are cheering for your great victory and actively learning from your glorious example. We are supporting you with practical actions such as strengthening national defense, actively engaging in production, strengthening patriotic education, and opposing American cultural aggression.
    We wish you continued success in annihilating the invading forces led by the United States until they are driven out of Korea.
　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    New Year's Telegram to the People's Volunteer Army
    [Xinhua News Agency] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on December 30, 1950, to congratulate them on the New Year. The text of the telegram is as follows:
    To the commanders, fighters, and logistics personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    As 1950 is about to pass and 1951 is about to arrive, we celebrate your victory with boundless joy and extend our highest respect and heartfelt condolences to you on behalf of the Chinese working class!
    Comrades! Since you have carried out the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country assigned by the people of the whole country, and entered our fraternal state—Korea, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, you have successively achieved great victories. You have thoroughly crushed the arrogant invasion plan of the vicious executioner MacArthur, frustrated the ferocity of the American aggressors, deepened the contradictions within the American aggressive bloc, transformed the military situation of the Korean War of Liberation, and completely bankrupted all the shameless intimidation of American imperialism. The paper tiger of American imperialism has been exposed.
    Comrades! The American imperialists are deliberately trying to put the chains of slavery around the necks of the Korean people and to turn Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam into military bases and colonies of Wall Street. But the power of the great Chinese and Korean people is an invincible power forever. Without a doubt, the American imperialists will be defeated, and the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world will be victorious.
    Your victory has inspired the broad masses of people around the world who are fighting for peace, and has also inspired the Chinese people's confidence in fighting for peace. The workers of the whole country will support you with practical actions of patriotic production competitions. We believe that with the arrival of the New Year, we will hear more and greater news of your victories! The enemy's claws of aggression will be cut off the day they do not retract! The enemy will be defeated the day they do not lay down their arms! We wish you a victorious advance!
                                All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                                  December 30
