Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The China Tanker Company convened its second Board of Directors meeting in the capital on the 9th of this month. Attendees included Chairman Yu Mei, Vice Chairman Wu Zhaohong (represented by Guo Kequan), Directors Han Kexin, Zhang Ming, Xu Benchun, Qin Shaoji (represented by Xu Benchun), Wang Bingnan, Gu Jiukuan, Chen Tianjun (represented by Zhang Biyuan), and Supervisors Deng Yindong, Shi Naizheng, and Guo Kequan. At the meeting, Deputy General Manager Wang Bingnan reported on the company's business situation in the year since its takeover. Following this, Chairman Yu Mei reported on the repair of the company's 15,000-ton Yonghao vessel in Hong Kong, stating: In June 1949, the company's responsible persons, Wang Bingnan and Gu Jiukuan, telegraphed the Hong Kong Whampoa Dock, instructing them to continue repairs on behalf of the Shanghai head office and not to transfer the vessel to anyone else. On April 1, 1950, all employees of the vessel, led by Shao Liang, director of the repair engineering supervision office, declared an uprising in Hong Kong, joining the people's motherland. On June 29, the Shanghai head office sent a telegram instructing Shao Liang, director of the supervision office, to have the vessel managed by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hong Kong branch. Starting in October, the captain and crew appointed by the company from Shanghai arrived in Hong Kong one after another to board the ship, actively taking responsibility for protecting state property. On December 17, 1950, all employees of the company in Hong Kong, with excitement, held a flag-raising ceremony as the vessel neared completion, solemnly raising the five-star national flag from the bow of the ship. Shao Liang, director of the supervision office, and Captain Zuo Wenyuan delivered speeches on the spot, calling on all crew members to resolutely protect the assets. Yu Mei continued: Recently, the company received a letter from the head office of the Bank of Communications stating that the company still owed the Bank of Communications a principal of 800,000 US dollars for the repair of the Yonghao vessel. This debt should be repaid by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Before the debt is cleared, the Yonghao vessel should be managed by the Ministry of Transport of the Central People's Government. Yu Mei also requested the Board of Directors to decide on how to handle this matter.

After discussion at the meeting, all the directors and supervisors of the China Tanker Company decided: 1. To approve the company's business report. 2. To fully accept the suggestion of the head office of the Bank of Communications that the loan be repaid by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and that the Yonghao tanker be managed by the Ministry of Transport of the Central People's Government. And to request the Ministry of Transport to designate the Hong Kong branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to be responsible for acceptance inspection from the Whampoa Dock. 3. To urge the Whampoa Dock to quickly complete the repair of the Yonghao vessel.

Note: The China Tanker Company and its Board of Directors were taken over by the Shanghai Military Control Commission after the liberation of Shanghai in May 1949, and its business was under the leadership of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It was reorganized in 1949. The new company's articles of association and the organizational rules of the Board of Directors were all approved by the Ministry of Transport of the Central People's Government. The Ministry of Transport also appointed Zhang Ming as General Manager, Wang Bingnan and Gu Jiukuan as Deputy General Managers, Yu Mei as Chairman, Wu Zhaohong as Vice Chairman, Han Kexin, Zhang Ming, Qin Shaoji, Wang Bingnan, Gu Jiukuan, Xu Benchun, and Chen Tianjun as Directors, and Deng Yindong, Guo Kequan, and Shi Naizheng as Supervisors. Li Yuncheng, the company's previous General Manager, had relinquished his duties and left Shanghai before the liberation of Shanghai. All letters issued by him externally are naturally invalid.
