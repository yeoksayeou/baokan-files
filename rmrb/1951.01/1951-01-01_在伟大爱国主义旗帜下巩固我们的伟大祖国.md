China's people passed through 1950 in great victory and entered 1951.

In 1950, through their own experience, the Chinese people answered three fundamental questions that existed after the victory over Chiang Kai-shek. These questions were: First, can we carry out our own construction without relying on the "aid" of capitalist countries? Second, after the failure of their running dog Chiang Kai-shek, will the imperialists in capitalist countries automatically abandon their aggression against China and let us "bury ourselves" in construction? Third, can we defeat imperialist aggression to safeguard the security of our motherland?

Our great achievements on the economic front in the past year answered the first question. Contrary to the assertions of the imperialist elements who asserted that China could not do without American "aid," the Central People's Government quickly realized the unification of national finance, balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure, and guaranteed the supply of materials, thus preventing the long-term war and the long-term reactionary rule left behind by the phenomenon of inflation and high prices that American "aid" could never solve. The Central People's Government solved complex problems such as restoring transportation, building water conservancy projects, providing disaster relief, developing trade, adjusting industry and commerce, and reducing the people's burden on an unprecedented scale and speed, thereby rapidly restoring industrial and agricultural production in 1950. Among them, the output of steel and yarn has exceeded the level of 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War, and the output of grain and cotton has also approached the level before the Anti-Japanese War. The national economy has gradually consolidated its leading position and is gradually reducing anarchy in production. The recovery of production and domestic and foreign trade, the regulation of prices, the development of workers' welfare work, the implementation of rent reduction and land reform, the reduction of agricultural taxes, and the relief of disasters and unemployment have significantly improved the lives of some of China's working people, initially improved the lives of some, and are completing the conditions for improving the lives of others.

All of this is not the result of "aid" from any capitalist country, but the result of rejecting and opposing such so-called "aid," but the result of our great people's self-reliance and struggle under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, and the result of the generous assistance of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union. Since our people have gained such rich harvests in 1950, there is no doubt that we will get even richer harvests in the next few years, bringing our country into a climax of economic construction. Isn't this clear?

Immediately afterwards, the U.S. imperialists answered the second question for us with their actions. The U.S. imperialists reminded the Chinese people that the war between revolution and counter-revolution in China was not over. Seeing that the victorious Chinese people were gradually embarking on the road of economic recovery, the U.S. imperialists were not satisfied with ordering Chiang Kai-shek to bomb and blockade the southeast coast (in fact, these bombings and blockades were gradually defeated by the Chinese people), but in June 1950 they launched an adventurous invasion of Korea, a springboard close to the Chinese mainland, and Taiwan, Chinese territory. All these aggressions were groundless and completely destructive of international faith and the United Nations Charter, and were acts of robbery. After suffering a severe blow from the Korean people in Korea, the U.S. imperialists gathered the largest possible force they could muster in Incheon in September, occupied Pyongyang, and surged toward our northeastern border, all the way to the Yalu River. The U.S. Air Force continuously invaded our northeastern airspace to bomb and strafe. This wanton occupation of Chinese territory and wanton threat to Chinese security forced the Chinese people to actively strengthen our national defense forces in order to liberate Taiwan, resist any possible new aggression, and take voluntary action to assist the Korean people in expelling the American aggressors in order to ensure the security of our mainland.

In this way, it proves that when imperialist aggressive forces threaten China and oppress the East, we cannot imagine that the Chinese people can ignore foreign affairs and "bury themselves" in construction. The Chinese people's revolutionary war is not over, and the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Taiwan and Korea is an extension and expansion of their intervention in the Chinese revolution. The imperialists will not automatically give up intervention and aggression. Only when they are defeated by the revolutionary people to the point that they have to admit defeat will they be forced to abandon such intervention and aggression. This proves that the Chinese people must make consolidating national defense and developing the anti-imperialist struggle their primary task, and make this task help and combine with the task of economic construction.

So, can we defeat imperialist aggression? The great Chinese People's Volunteers answered: Absolutely! The heroic fighting of the People's Volunteers in Korea for more than two months has proved that even in the absence of airplanes and tanks and very few cannons, the most "powerful" imperialist army can be defeated. The People's Volunteers proved the truth that the power of the Chinese people and the power of the world's people can never be defeated, and proved the truth that U.S. imperialism and all imperialism are paper tigers, thus greatly eliminating the fear of America among some Chinese and some foreigners.

Therefore, as we enter 1951, although the imperialists' aggression against us has not stopped, we are confidently facing a bright future.

The central task of the Chinese people in 1951 should be to consolidate our great motherland militarily, politically, economically, and culturally with great efforts, so that imperialists and their running dogs have no possibility to undermine our great revolutionary cause and great construction cause.

That is to say, in 1951, the Chinese people must continue to support the just struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people in Korea, and use the greatest strength to strengthen our great national defense army, in order to finally complete the liberation of the entire China and repel any possible new foreign aggression. Through earnest efforts, making our country, like the Soviet Union, become the world's first-class military power will not only guarantee the security of our great motherland and enable our economic construction and social reform work to proceed smoothly, but will also powerfully strengthen peace in the East and the world.

That is to say, the Chinese people must strive to develop land reform in 1951, resolutely eliminate lurking counter-revolutionaries and the remnants of bandits in a few areas, earnestly strengthen the organizational work and political education work of the national working class, and continue to strengthen the unity of all nationalities, all democratic classes, and all democratic parties. From the winter of 1950 to the spring of 1951, land reform is being carried out in the newly liberated areas with a population of 130 million people across the country, and from the winter of 1951 to the spring of 1952, land reform will be basically completed throughout the country except for a few ethnic minority areas. This will greatly strengthen the political and economic foundation of the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship.

That is to say, the Chinese people must consolidate the economic positions they have already gained in 1951, earnestly restore and develop the nation's industrial and agricultural production with a focus, and make systematic preparations for further development of production. To this end, it is necessary to develop the most important and defense-related industries and transportation, continue to build water conservancy projects necessary for the development of agricultural production, and vigorously develop domestic trade and cooperative undertakings necessary for industrial and agricultural production, which will constitute the focus of economic construction work in 1951. And earnestly improving the material lives of workers, farmers, and other working people is one of the important conditions for the smooth progress of all this economic work.

That is to say, the Chinese people must continue to develop ideological education on resisting America and aiding Korea in 1951, eradicate the political influence left over by the long-term aggression of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, in China, and guide this ideological struggle into a climax of loving the motherland.

Why is it precisely now that a climax of patriotism must be aroused? What is the content of patriotism of the Chinese people today, and what is its significance for the military, political, and economic tasks of the Chinese people?

The patriotism of the Chinese people today is not something abstract. Its content is to oppose imperialist aggression and feudal oppression, to defend the fruits of the Chinese people's democratic revolution, to support New Democracy, to support progress and oppose backwardness, to support the working people, to support the internationalist alliance of China with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and the working people of the world, and to strive for the socialist future. To arouse this patriotism is to summarize the experience of the Chinese people's struggle, to complete the ideological liberation of the Chinese people from imperialism, and to use the Chinese people's confidence in their own great strength and bright future to eliminate the colonial people's inferiority complex created, spread, and used by imperialist aggressors and their running dog comprador bourgeoisie to disintegrate the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. The Chinese people's experience in struggle over many years, especially in 1950, proves that this patriotic education is completely in line with the truth; therefore, carrying out this education will be a constant driving force for completing the Chinese people's glorious tasks in the military, political, and economic fields.

For many years, the imperialists and their running dogs have tried every means to spread the idea that the Chinese people are backward, that everything in China is no good, that everything must rely on the "civilization" and "aid" of imperialist foreigners, and that the struggle against imperialism is bound to suffer defeat, and so on. Haven't all these fallacies been proven to be completely bankrupt by the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, by the victory of the Chinese people in the process of economic recovery, and by the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea? Haven't the Chinese people already proved that they are one of the most important political, military, economic, and ideological forces in the world? Compared with the bourgeoisie of the imperialist countries, who is noble, who is superior, who has achieved victory through intelligence, courage, unity, and struggle, and who will continue to achieve victory? Shouldn't we draw a definite conclusion on such questions now?

The imperialists and their running dogs have arrogantly attempted to obliterate the position of the Chinese people, who account for about a quarter of the world's population, in the world, and even to obliterate the position of Chinese history in world history. But this is in vain. We oppose the national essenceists and nationalists who refuse to learn from foreign countries and despise other nations, and oppose arrogance, but also oppose self-deprecation. According to objective facts, China's long history and long-standing culture not only united 475 million people into a great country, but also is the center of the long history and long-standing culture of the East, and has influenced and continues to influence the whole world with its important contributions. Who has the right to obliterate objective facts? Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in his book "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," co-authored with other comrades:

"Our China is one of the largest countries in the world, its territory exceeding the area of the entire Europe. On this vast territory, there are vast fertile fields, giving us the source of food and clothing; there are large and small mountains, large and small plateaus, and plains across the country, giving us vast forests and storing rich mineral resources; there are many rivers and lakes, giving us the benefit of boats and irrigation; there is a very long coastline, giving us the convenience of communicating with various ethnic groups overseas. Since very ancient times, the ancestors of our Chinese nation have labored, lived, and multiplied on this vast land....

Our China now has a population of 475 million, almost a quarter of the world's population....

...In the history of the Chinese nation, mainly the Han nationality, there are well-developed agriculture and handicraft industries, many great thinkers, scientists, inventors, politicians, military strategists, writers, and artists, and a rich cultural heritage. In very early times, China had the invention of the compass. As early as 1,700 years ago, the papermaking method had been invented. 1,200 years ago, block printing was invented. 800 years ago, movable type printing was invented. The application of gunpowder was also earlier than the Europeans. Therefore, China is one of the countries with the earliest development of civilization in the world. China has a written history of nearly 5,000 years.

The Chinese nation is not only known for its hard work and endurance, but also a nation that loves freedom and is rich in revolutionary traditions. Taking the history of the Han nationality as an example, it proves that the Chinese people cannot tolerate the rule of dark forces, and they use revolutionary means to overthrow and transform this rule every time. In the thousands of years of Han history, there have been hundreds of large and small peasant wars, resisting the dark rule of landlords and aristocrats; and each change of dynasty was successful due to the power of peasant wars. The people of all ethnic groups in the Chinese nation are unwilling to be oppressed by foreign nations and want to use resistance to eliminate this oppression. They advocate equal union, not mutual oppression. In the thousands of years of Chinese history, many national heroes and revolutionary leaders have emerged. Therefore, the Chinese nation is also a nation with a glorious revolutionary tradition and an excellent historical heritage."

This is China in history. The Chinese people were often at the forefront of world culture for thousands of years, and only fell behind the Europeans in the last hundred years and suffered cruel oppression from capitalist and imperialist countries. Excellent Chinese patriots were unwilling to accept this backward and oppressed state, so they carried out a relentless struggle, and finally found the truth of Marxism-Leninism in the struggle as a weapon to liberate themselves. The fact that the great Chinese working people combined with Marxism-Leninism has enabled the Chinese people to quickly surpass the already corrupt Western capitalist countries in ideology, politics, and even military affairs, and this has created the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution. The union of the victorious Chinese people and the Soviet people is not only the union of the two most populous and largest countries in Asia and Europe, but also the union of the two most advanced and most solid countries. This union is therefore invincible in the world.

All of this is a simple picture of our great motherland. Shouldn't we be proud of and cheer for our motherland? Should we have any doubts about our strength and future? Whether on the military, political, or economic fronts, we have already achieved great victories, and we will certainly achieve even greater victories in the future. Let us hold high the banner of patriotism and bravely strive to consolidate and expand our victories! Our cause is advanced and just, and is consistent with the interests of all mankind. If the small, fragile, and reactionary imperialism does not stop its aggression against China and the East, it will only accelerate its own demise, while our great motherland will advance forward forever, unshakably.

Consolidate and love our motherland a hundredfold! Long live our great motherland!

### 在伟大爱国主义旗帜下巩固我们的伟大祖国

　　在伟大爱国主义旗帜下巩固我们的伟大祖国
    中国人民在伟大的胜利中度过了一九五○年而进入一九五一年。
    在一九五○年内，中国人民以自己的经验答复了在战胜蒋介石以后所存在的三个根本问题，这些问题是：第一，我们能够不依靠资本主义国家的“援助”而进行自己的建设吗？第二，资本主义国家中的帝国主义者在他们的走狗蒋介石失败以后，会自动放弃对于中国的侵略，而让我们“埋头”建设吗？第三，我们能够战胜帝国主义者的侵略，以保障我们祖国的安全吗？
    我们在过去一年中的经济战线上的伟大成就，答复了第一个问题。与那些断定中国离不了美国“援助”的帝国主义分子们的论断完全相反，中央人民政府迅速实现了全国财政的统一，平衡了财政的收支，保障了物资的供应，因而制止了长期战争和长期反动统治所遗下的、为美国“援助”所永远无法解决的通货膨胀物价高涨的现象。中央人民政府以空前的规模和速度解决了恢复交通、兴修水利、救济灾荒、发展贸易、调整工商业、减轻人民负担等复杂的问题，从而使一九五○年的工农业生产迅速恢复，其中钢铁和纱布的产量已经超过抗日战争前的一九三六年的水平，粮食和棉花的产量也已经接近抗日战争前的水平。国家经济逐步地巩固了自己的领导地位，并正在逐步地减少生产中的无政府状态。生产和国内外贸易的恢复，物价的调节，工人福利工作的发展，减租和土地改革工作的进行，农业税的减轻，灾荒和失业的救济，使中国劳动人民的生活有些得到了显著的改善，有些得到了初步的改善，有些则正在完成着改善生活的条件。
    所有这一切都不是依靠任何资本主义国家“援助”的结果，而是拒绝和反对这种所谓“援助”的结果，而是我国伟大的人民在伟大的中国共产党领导之下自力奋斗，并得到伟大的社会主义国家苏联慷慨援助的结果。我国人民既然能在一九五○年得到如此丰富的收获，那么就不能怀疑我们在今后数年内必将得到更丰富的收获，使我国进入经济建设的高潮。这难道还不明白吗？
    紧接着，美帝国主义者以他们的行动给我们答复了第二个问题。美帝国主义者提醒中国人民：中国的革命与反革命之间的战争还没有完结。美帝国主义者看到胜利了的中国人民逐步走上经济恢复的大道，于是就不以命令蒋介石轰炸和封锁东南沿海为满足（事实上这些轰炸和封锁也逐步被中国人民所战胜了），而在一九五○年六月发起了对于接近中国大陆的跳板朝鲜和中国的领土台湾的冒险侵略。所有这些侵略都是毫无理由的，都是完全破坏国际信义和联合国宪章的强盗行为。美帝国主义者在朝鲜遭受了朝鲜人民的痛击以后，又在九月间纠合其可能纠合的最大兵力在仁川登陆，占领平壤，并向我国东北边境汹涌前进，直至鸭绿江边。美国空军连续侵入我国东北领空轰炸扫射。这种对于中国领土的放肆的霸占和对于中国安全的放肆的威胁，迫使中国人民不能不积极加强我们的国防力量，以便解放台湾，抵抗任何可能的新侵略，并且不能不以志愿行动援助朝鲜人民驱逐美国侵略军，以便保障我国的大陆的安全。
    这样，就证明了在帝国主义侵略势力威胁着中国，压迫着东方的时候，我们不可能设想中国人民可以不问外事，“埋头”建设。中国人民革命战争还没有完结，而美帝国主义者对台湾和朝鲜的侵略，正是他们对中国革命的干涉行动的延长和扩大。帝国主义者是不会自动放弃干涉和侵略的，只有被革命的人民所击退以至不能不自认失败的时候，才会被迫放弃这种干涉和侵略。这样，就证明了中国人民必须把巩固国防力量，发展反帝国主义斗争当作首要的任务，并使这个任务与经济建设的任务互相帮助，互相结合。
    那么，我们能否战胜帝国主义的侵略呢？伟大的中国人民志愿军答复道：完全能够！人民志愿军在朝鲜两个多月的英勇作战，证明了甚至在没有飞机坦克和很少大炮的条件下，最“强大”的帝国主义军队也是可以击败的。人民志愿军证明了中国人民力量和世界人民力量永远不能被战胜的真理，证明了美帝国主义和一切帝国主义都是纸老虎的真理，因而大大地扫除了一部分中国人和一部分外国人中间的恐美病。
    因此，当我们进入一九五一年的时候，帝国主义对于我们的侵略虽然还没有停止，我们却是满怀信心地面向着光明的将来。
    中国人民在一九五一年的中心任务，应当是用极大的努力，在军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上巩固我们的伟大祖国，使帝国主义者及其走狗没有可能来破坏我们的伟大革命事业和伟大建设事业。
    这就是说，中国人民在一九五一年必须继续支援在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民的正义斗争，并且用最大的力量来加强我们伟大的国防军，以便最后完成全中国的解放，并击退任何可能的新的外国侵略。经过认真的努力，使我国和苏联一样地成为世界第一流军事强国，这将不但保障我们伟大祖国的安全，使我们的经济建设和社会改革的工作得以顺利进行，并且将有力地加强东方和世界的和平。
    这就是说，中国人民必须在一九五一年努力发展土地改革工作，坚决消灭潜伏的反革命分子和少数地区残余的土匪，认真加强全国工人阶级的组织工作和政治教育工作，继续加强各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派的团结。在一九五○年冬至一九五一年春，全国已有一亿三千万人口的新解放区在进行着土地改革，而在一九五一年冬至一九五二年春，全国除少数民族地区外，将基本上完成土地改革工作。这将使中国人民民主专政的政治基础和经济基础大为加强。
    这就是说，中国人民必须在一九五一年巩固已经取得的经济阵地，认真地恢复和有重点地发展全国的工业生产和农业生产，并为进一步的发展生产作有系统的准备工作。为此，必须发展最重要的和有关国防的工业和交通事业，继续兴修为发展农业生产所必需的水利事业，用大力发展为工农业生产所必需的国内贸易和合作事业，这些将构成一九五一年经济建设工作的重点。而认真改善工人、农民和其他劳动人民的物质生活，则是顺利进行这一切经济工作的重要条件之一。
    这就是说，中国人民必须在一九五一年继续发展抗美援朝的思想教育，铲除帝国主义首先是美帝国主义在中国长期侵略所遗留的政治影响，并将这种思想斗争引导成为热爱祖国的高潮。
    为什么恰恰是现在必须兴起爱国主义的高潮呢？什么是今天中国人民的爱国主义的内容，它对于中国人民的军事、政治、经济任务有什么意义呢？
    中国人民今天的爱国主义并不是什么抽象的东西，它的内容，就是反对帝国主义侵略和封建主义压迫，就是保卫中国人民民主革命的果实，就是拥护新民主主义，就是拥护进步，反对落后，就是拥护劳动人民，就是拥护中国与苏联和人民民主国家的以及全世界劳动人民的国际主义联盟，就是争取社会主义的前途。兴起这种爱国主义，就是总结中国人民的斗争经验，完成中国人民反帝国主义的思想解放，用中国人民对于自身伟大力量和光明前途的信心，来消灭帝国主义侵略者及其走狗买办资产阶级所制造、散布、借以瓦解中国人民革命斗争的殖民地人民的自卑心。中国人民在许多年中间特别是一九五○年中间的斗争经验，证明这种爱国主义的教育是完全合乎真理的；因此，进行这种教育，对于完成中国人民在军事、政治、经济各方面的光荣任务，将是一个经常起作用的动力。
    帝国主义者及其走狗们许多年来曾经千方百计地宣传所谓中国人民是落后的，中国的一切都不行，都必须依赖帝国主义外国的“教化”和“援助”，与帝国主义斗争必然受遭失败，等等。难道这一切谬论还没有被中国人民革命的胜利，被中国人民在经济恢复过程中的胜利，被中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的胜利所证明为完全破产吗？中国人民难道不是已经证明了自己是世界上最重要的政治力量、军事力量、经济力量和思想力量的一部分了吗？中国劳动人民和帝国主义国家的资产阶级相比较：究竟是谁高尚？是谁优越？是谁由于聪明勇敢团结奋斗而得到了胜利并将继续得到胜利？对于这样的问题，难道现在还不应当作出确定无疑的结论来吗？
    帝国主义者及其走狗曾经狂妄地企图抹煞约占全人类四分之一的中国人民在世界上的地位，并且进而抹煞中国历史在世界历史上的地位。但是这是徒劳无功的。我们反对拒绝学习外国和轻视其他民族的国粹主义者和民族主义者，反对妄自尊大，但是也反对妄自菲薄。按照客观的事实，中国的悠久历史和悠久文化，不但使四亿七千五百万人团结为一个伟大国家，而且是东方的悠久历史和悠久文化的中心，而且曾经并继续以自己的重要贡献影响全世界。任何人有什么权利来抹煞客观的事实呢？毛泽东同志在他和其他同志合著的“中国革命与中国共产党”一书中写道：
    “我们中国是世界上最大国家之一，他的领土超过了整个欧洲的面积。在这个广大领土之上，有广大的肥田沃地，给我们以衣食之源；有纵横全国的大小山脉、大小高原、平原，给我们生长了广大的森林，贮藏了丰富的矿产；有很多的江河湖泽，给我们以舟楫与灌溉之利；有很长的海岸线，给我们以交通海外各民族的方便。从很早的古代起，我们中华民族的祖先就劳动、生息、繁殖在这块广大土地之上。……
    我们中国现在拥有四亿七千五百万人口，差不多占了全世界人口的四分之一。……
    ……在中华民族主要地是汉族的开化史上，有素称发达的农业和手工业，有许多伟大的思想家、科学家、发明家、政治家、军事家、文学家和艺术家，有丰富的文化典籍。在很早的时候，中国就有了指南针的发明。还在一千七百年前，已经发明了造纸法。在一千二百年前，已经发明了刻板印刷。在八百年前，更发明了活字印刷。火药的应用，也在欧洲人之前。所以，中国是世界文明发达最早的国家之一。中国已有了将近五千年的有文字可考的历史。
    中华民族不但是以刻苦耐劳著称于世，同时又是酷爱自由富于革命传统的民族。以汉族的历史为例，证明中国人民是不能忍受黑暗势力的统治的，他们每次都用革命手段达到推翻与改造这种统治的目的。在汉族的数千年的历史上，有过大小几百次的农民战争，反抗地主贵族的黑暗统治；而每次朝代的更换，都是由于农民战争的力量才能得到成功的。中华民族的各族人民对于外来民族的压迫都是不愿意的，都是要用反抗的手段解除这种压迫。他们赞成平等的联合，而不赞成互相压迫。在中华民族的几千年的历史中，产生了很多的民族英雄与革命领袖。所以，中华民族又是一个有光荣革命传统和优秀历史遗产的民族。”
    这就是历史上的中国。中国人民在几千年中经常居于世界文化的前列，只是在近一百多年间才落于欧洲人之后，并遭受资本主义和帝国主义国家的残酷压迫。优秀的中国爱国者不甘心于这种落后和被压迫状态，因此进行了前仆后继的斗争，终于在斗争中找到了马克思列宁主义的真理作为解放自己的武器。伟大的中国劳动人民与马克思列宁主义相结合的事实，使中国人民迅速地在思想上、政治上以至军事上超过了已经腐朽的西方资本主义国家，而这就造成了中国人民革命的伟大胜利。胜利了的中国人民和苏联人民的联合，这不但是欧亚两洲两个人口最多领土最广的国家的联合，而且是两个最先进最巩固的国家的联合，这个联合，因此而无敌于天下。
    所有这些，就是我们伟大祖国的简单图画。难道我们不应当为我们的祖国而骄傲，而欢呼吗？难道我们对于自己的力量和前途，应当有丝毫的怀疑吗？无论是在军事、政治或经济的战线上，我们都已经得到了伟大的胜利，在今后必将得到更伟大的胜利。让我们高举爱国主义的旗帜，为巩固和扩大我们的胜利而勇敢地奋斗吧！我们的事业是先进的，正义的，是与全人类的利益相一致的，渺小的脆弱的反动的帝国主义如果不停止它对于中国和东方的侵略，就只有加速它自己的灭亡，而我们的伟大祖国，却将永远不可动摇地前进，再前进。
    百倍地巩固和热爱我们的祖国！我们的伟大祖国万岁！
