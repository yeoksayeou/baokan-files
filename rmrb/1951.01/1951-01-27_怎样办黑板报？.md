How to Run a Blackboard Newspaper?
    Zhong Yulin
    Blackboard newspapers across the country, whether in factories, rural areas, or cities, have played a significant role in publicizing current events, promoting policies, and driving production.

    Whether the leadership and organizational issues of blackboard newspapers can be resolved is the key to their success or failure. Based on available materials, here are various ways to address this:

    I. A specialized organization should be established by local administrative bodies and Party committees to uniformly lead the blackboard newspaper work. For example, the Heshan Third District blackboard newspaper, as introduced by the Yuezhong People's Daily, is managed by a Blackboard Newspaper Management Committee established by the district, which is specifically responsible for the interviewing and writing of the blackboard newspaper. Huaining County in northern Anhui established a Blackboard Newspaper Editorial Committee to connect with and lead the blackboard newspaper work in various districts, providing materials for blackboard newspapers in each district, stipulating that at least one should be established in each township, and organized a blackboard newspaper working group composed of village cadres and primary school teachers to carry out the work. In addition to Huaining, some villages have a village blackboard newspaper committee composed of six to seven people, including the village head, the secretary of the Communist Party branch, the propaganda officer, primary school teachers, and heads of mass organizations such as the farmers' association and the women's federation, with the village head and branch secretary serving as the director and deputy director. In this way, counties, districts, townships, and villages all have specific organizational structures. If cadres in charge of propaganda and education work can treat blackboard newspaper work as an important political task, the blackboard newspaper can be sustained and achieve results.

    II. In urban suburbs, cultural centers should take the lead in organizing and mobilizing various government agencies, organizations, and schools to run them separately. For example, the Tong County blackboard newspaper in Hebei is uniformly led by the cultural center, which distributes drafts to various primary schools for publication. Dongtai in northern Jiangsu also used the Civil Education Center as the main body, convening responsible persons from relevant agencies to establish a Blackboard Newspaper Committee, with the education center preparing the layouts and distributing them to the social education directors of each school, who then organized primary school teachers and private school teachers to copy them in rotation. The Shijiazhuang Cultural Center itself only copied four pieces, but it had a demonstration and promotion effect on more than a hundred blackboard newspapers in the city.

    III. Within factories, it is generally managed by the Party branch or the trade union. The blackboard newspapers of the Changxindian Railway Factory and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant are both managed by the trade union. The Second Manufacturing Workshop of the First Machine Tool Plant in Shenyang, Northeast China, established a blackboard newspaper team, with the chairman of the branch serving as the team leader. Because the production work of factories has a high degree of organization, the leadership issue of blackboard newspapers is relatively simple.

    IV. Most of the street blackboard newspapers in cities are managed by the Public Security Bureau, which uniformly leads the resident groups to run them. For example, all 168 blackboard newspapers in Ningbo, Zhejiang, are led by the Public Security Bureau, with the police stations supervising the resident groups. In Beijing, each police station manages its own, and the Public Security Bureau has not yet unified leadership. Some blackboard newspapers are run by the reading groups of various newspapers.

    The content of the blackboard newspaper must meet the needs of the masses. For example, if there is an epidemic in rural areas, the blackboard newspaper should publicize epidemic prevention. On the days of wage payment in factories, the blackboard newspaper should also announce the price of wages in rice or the equivalent unit. The Datong Cultural Center often maintains contact with various government agencies in Datong City and publishes on the blackboard newspaper what the agencies want to tell the masses. At the same time, it also sends the questions raised by the masses received by the information desk of the cultural center to the relevant agencies for answers, and then replies to the masses on the blackboard newspaper.

    Regarding the source of manuscripts for blackboard newspapers, many newspapers now specifically publish materials for blackboard newspapers for reference in various places. Current events manuals have several current events summaries in each issue. The Tong County Cultural Center has revised current events news and distributed it to various blackboard newspapers for publication. However, local news must be interviewed by correspondents. In cities, the blackboard newspaper correspondence work is handled by activists from government agencies, schools, mass organizations, and factories. In rural areas, farmers' associations, women's federations, Party and League members, primary school teachers, militia members, and other activists jointly collect manuscripts. Those who cannot write find someone to write for them. For example, in Guowangdu Village in the Fourth District of Anyang, Pingyuan, it is the responsibility of the primary school teachers, and all the village cadres are responsible for collecting materials. In the evening, everyone meets to study and write. Attention must be paid to the authenticity and timeliness of the collected materials, especially for manuscripts of criticism and praise, which must be handled with caution. The Jiefang Daily introduced the experience of the blackboard newspaper of the Shanghai No. 2 Textile Factory, one of which is: "Grasping timeliness is the most important condition. The masses like to read the blackboard newspaper because they feel that there are factory news and new content every day."

    The manuscripts must be as popular as possible, and it is best to use some local dialects as much as possible, so that not only can the masses understand, but also can be understood when heard. Appropriate materials can be compiled into forms such as allegros, wall poems, and doggerels that the masses like to hear. After the manuscripts for the blackboard newspaper in Xupu County, Xiangxi, are written, they are first read to the farmers. If they don't understand, they are revised. Some manuscripts have been rewritten two or three times before being published.

　　怎样办黑板报？
    钟毓琳
    全国各地的黑板报，不管在工厂、农村或城市，不管在宣传时事，阐扬政策，或推动生产上，都发挥了巨大的作用。
    黑板报的领导与组织问题能否解决，可以说是黑板报成败的关键问题。根据现有的材料，解决这个问题，有下列各种方法：
    一、由当地行政机构和党委组织一个专门机构来统一领导黑板报工作。如粤中人民报所介绍的鹤山三区黑板报就是由区成立了黑板报管理委员会，专门负责黑板报的采访和编写工作。皖北怀宁县成立了黑板报编辑委员会，联系和领导各区的黑板报工作，供给各区黑板报资料，规定每乡至少建立一块，由乡村干部及小学教师等组成黑板报工作小组来进行工作。除怀宁外，有些村是由村长、中共支部书记、宣传干事、小学教师及农协会、妇联等群众团体的负责人六人至七人，组成村黑板报委员会，由村长、支书任正副主任。这样县、区、乡、村都有一定的组织机构。负责宣教工作的干部，如能把黑板报工作当做重要的政治任务，黑板报便能坚持下去并取得成绩。
    二、在城市郊区，以文化馆为主，组织动员各机关、团体、学校分别来办。如河北通县黑板报就是由文化馆统一领导，发稿给各小学办理。苏北东台也是以民教馆为主体，召集各有关机关负责人，成立了黑板报委员会，由教育馆编好版样，分送各校社教主任，由他们组织小学教师、塾师轮流抄写。石家庄的文化馆本身只抄了四块，但对全市百余块黑板报有示范和推动的作用。
    三、在工厂内，一般都是由党支或工会来搞的。长辛店铁路工厂、石景山钢铁厂，他们的黑板报，都是由工会来主持的。东北沈阳第一机器厂第二制造场，成立了黑板报小组，由支会主席担任小组长。因为工厂的生产工作有高度的组织性，黑板报的领导问题就比较单纯。
    四、城市的街道黑板报，大多数由公安局统一领导居民小组来搞。如浙江宁波全市有一百六十八块黑板报，都由公安局领导，由派出所来督促居民小组办的。北京则由各派出所自行管理，公安局尚未予以统一领导。有些黑板报是由各报的读报组办的。
    黑板报的内容必须切合群众的需要。如农村中发生疫病，黑板报就要宣传防疫。工厂内发薪的日子，黑板报就要附带公布工资米或折实单位的牌价。大同文化馆经常与大同市各机关保持联系，把各机关要告诉群众的事在黑板报上登出来。同时又把文化馆问事处所收到的群众提出的问题，送到有关机关去解答，然后在黑板报上答复群众。
    关于黑板报稿件的来源问题，目前已有不少报纸，特地撰刊黑板报的资料，专供各地黑板报参考。时事手册每期都有几条时事摘要。通县文化馆曾将时事新闻加以改写，发给各黑板报刊用。但当地的新闻，就必须由通讯员负责采访。城市的黑板报通讯工作，各地都由机关、学校、群众团体、工厂的积极分子来负责，农村中则由农会、妇女会、党团员、小学教员、民兵、及其他积极分子共同搜集稿件，不会写的找人代写。如平原安阳四区郭王度村是由小学教师负责的，全体村干部负责收集材料，到晚上大家碰头，研究编写。搜集材料必须注意真实性和时间性，尤其是批评和表扬的稿子，更要慎重处理。解放日报介绍上海纺织二厂的黑板报经验，其中一条就是：“掌握时间性是最主要的条件，群众看黑板报觉得每天都有厂里的消息，都有新的内容，就欢喜看。”
    稿件必须力求通俗，最好多用一些当地口语，尽可能做到：非但能使群众看懂，而且能被听懂。可把适当材料编写成群众高兴听的快板、墙头诗、顺口溜等形式。湘西溆浦县的黑板报，稿子写好以后先念给农民听，听不懂就改，曾经有些稿子改写两三次才登出去。
