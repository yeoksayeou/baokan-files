The Matsukawa Incident was a heinous conspiracy planned by U.S. imperialism and its accomplice, the Yoshida Cabinet, to frame the Japanese Communist Party and attack the Japanese working class. Using this incident, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, through the Fukushima District Court, sentenced Suzuki Shin, chairman of the Fukushima branch of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, and Honda Noboru, Abe Ichiji, Sato Hajime, and Sugiura Saburo to death on December 6th of last year. Takeda Hisashi, chairman of the Fukushima branch of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, and Akama Katsumi, Takahashi Haruo, Ota Shoji, and Ninomiya Yutaka were sentenced to life imprisonment. Another ten people were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three and a half to fifteen years, totaling ninety-five and a half years. Now, with the support of the working class and the broad masses of people in Japan and around the world, these victims are preparing to appeal to the Sendai Court in Japan, denouncing the outrageous and unreasonable persecution by the Japanese reactionaries.

The so-called "Matsukawa Incident" occurred at 3:00 a.m. on August 17, 1949. The No. 412 up-line train on the Japan Tohoku Main Line (traveling from Tohoku to Tokyo) derailed and overturned between Kanayagawa Station and Matsukawa Station in Fukushima Prefecture because the railroad spikes had been removed. Three train crew members died at the time. After this train derailment, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries immediately mobilized all their loyal newspapers and radio stations to assert that it was a "destructive and violent act by the Japanese Communist Party." Then, using this as an excuse, they arrested a large number of Communist Party members and progressive railway workers in Matsukawa, and searched the offices of the Fukushima branch of the Japan National Railway (referred to as "Kokutetsu") Workers' Union and the Matsukawa branch of the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company (referred to as "Toshiba") Workers' Union, unreasonably confiscating documents and books. Among those arrested were Takeda Hisashi, chairman of the "Kokutetsu" Workers' Union Fukushima branch, Suzuki Shin, chairman of the Fukushima branch, and Sugiura Saburo, chairman of the Matsukawa Workers' Union of Toshiba Electric Company. They were all leaders of the local labor movement.

The Matsukawa Incident occurred at a time when the U.S.-Japan reactionaries were carrying out massive layoffs at "Kokutetsu" and "Toshiba," using pretexts to purge progressive employees. At one point, as many as 95,000 people were laid off from "Kokutetsu." Therefore, with "Kokutetsu" and "Toshiba" as the center, Japanese workers launched a nationwide struggle. The day before the Matsukawa Incident, the "Toshiba" Matsukawa Workers' Union held a workers' meeting and decided to strike for one day. Many of those arrested in the Matsukawa Incident were progressive workers who bravely participated in the struggle that day.

This deliberate manufacturing of an incident by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, using false accusations to frame people, deeply angered the Japanese working people. After the incident broke out, the Fukushima Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and various people's organizations in Fukushima Prefecture, including the Fukushima branches of "Kokutetsu" and the Japan Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, the Fukushima prefectural and district labor unions, the "Toshiba" Matsukawa Workers' Union, and representatives of the agricultural union organization - the Agricultural Reconstruction Conference, formed an investigation team to investigate the truth of the Matsukawa Incident, expose the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and support those arrested.

After a year, although the U.S.-Japan reactionaries did not find any conclusive evidence, they instructed the Japanese prosecution authorities to request, on August 26 of last year, that ten of the twenty defendants in the so-called "Matsukawa Incident" be sentenced to death, three be sentenced to life imprisonment, and seven be sentenced to prison terms ranging from ten and a half to fifteen years, based on fabricated charges. However, the facts quickly proved that this accusation was absurd and unreasonable, that the reasons for the accusation were purely fictitious, and that the real criminals were not the Japanese Communists and progressive workers, but the U.S.-Japan reactionaries themselves.

When the Matsukawa Incident prosecutor listed the charges against those arrested, he said: "Someone used pliers to remove the spikes in two places in the dark of night, and the rails were completely loosened in one of the places, causing the train to derail." However, the pliers presented as evidence were less than one meter long, while those normally used by "Kokutetsu" were three times larger. Moreover, the event report submitted by the "Kokutetsu" Fukushima Administration Bureau to the Sendai Railway Bureau stated: "A pair of pliers cannot move the spikes that are tightened with more than 100 tons of force and cause the train to derail."

As for the confession of Akama Katsumi, which was presented as another piece of evidence by the prosecutor, it was proved during the trial, through the public exposure of those arrested, that this confession was entirely the product of torture and threats. Those arrested revealed that the despicable and shameless Japanese police station, because of the staunch unyielding of the JCP members, could not obtain confessions that met the requirements of the Japanese reactionaries from their mouths. They found Akama Katsumi, a non-Communist member who was not yet an adult, tortured him in every possible way, and threatened him, saying: "If you don't confess, you will either get life imprisonment or the death penalty." After the fictitious confession was made, Akama became a distinguished guest of the police station, where he was treated to cigarettes and alcohol every day, and the chief even washed his back while bathing.

Even more ridiculous, the prosecutor claimed that the train derailment was an event conspired by Suzuki Shin, Sato Hajime, Takahashi Haruo, and others. However, Suzuki Shin, the so-called mastermind of the conspiracy, was in the Fukushima JCP Prefectural Committee office all day on the day of the incident. At the same time, Sato Hajime was far away in Matsukawa, and Takahashi Haruo was far away in Yonezawa, both several or even dozens of ri away (one ri is about six Chinese li). Moreover, the above facts have been fully proven. How can people who are separated by several places jointly subvert a train? As the defense attorney for those arrested, Tatsuo Okabayashi, said, wouldn't this be a miracle?!

As a result, this shameless trial not only failed to prove the guilt of the victims, but also exposed the insidious conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to attack the Japanese working class and working people, making the Japanese people and the people of the world even more aware of the hideous and sinister face of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

However, despite the fact that the Japanese prosecution authorities could not provide any legitimate basis to constitute the criminal behavior of the defendants, the presiding judge of the Fukushima District Court, Nagao, sentenced Suzuki Shin and five others to death, Takeda Hisashi and five others to life imprisonment, and the other ten to prison terms ranging from three and a half to fifteen years on December 6 of last year. This unreasonable verdict aroused the unparalleled anger of the Japanese people towards the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, as well as sympathy and concern for the persecuted. According to a report from the Japan United News Agency on December 8 of last year, the audience seats were crowded with people on the day of the sentencing. When the presiding judge read the verdict, those arrested shouted loudly: "Oppose the traitorous trial!" "Please, presiding judge, get back to the other side of the sea!" and shouted to the audience: "We are innocent, please rest assured, we will fight to the end!" The families and masses of those arrested in the audience also replied loudly: "Keep it up! No one will trust such a verdict!" Finally, the entire courtroom resounded with the majestic Internationale. The embarrassed presiding judge had no choice but to use the weapon of announcing the adjournment to disperse the crowd. When the court continued in the afternoon, the audience was not allowed to enter.

Now, the detainees in the Matsukawa Incident are preparing to appeal to the Sendai Court. If they cannot win in the Sendai Court, they will continue to file a final appeal to the Tokyo Supreme Court. They will fight to the end with the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to defend their right to survival. All the people of China and the world recognize that the "Matsukawa Incident" is a planned attack by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries on the Japanese working class and working people, a step to clear the obstacles on the road to arming Japan, and a part of the U.S. imperialist aggression plan. Therefore, they are enthusiastically supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people.

　　松川事件介绍
    松川事件是美帝国主义及其帮凶吉田内阁有计划地制造的陷害日本共产党，进攻日本工人阶级的一个罪恶阴谋。美日反动派利用这一事件，于去年十二月六日，经由福岛地方裁判所，判决了日本国营铁路工会福岛分会委员长铃木信及本田升、阿部市次、佐藤一、杉浦三郎等五人死刑；日本国营铁路工会福岛支部委员长武田久及赤间胜美、高桥晴雄、太田省次、二宫丰等五人无期徒刑；另有其他十人分别被处三年半至十五年徒刑不等，这十个人的徒刑合计为九十五年半。现在这些被难者，在日本和全世界工人阶级和广大人民支持下，正在准备向日本仙台裁判所提出上诉，控诉日本反动当局这种横暴无理的迫害行为。
    所谓“松川事件”发生在一九四九年八月十七日上午三时。日本东北本线第四一二号上行列车（由日本东北开赴东京），驶至福岛县属金谷川站至松川站间，因铁路道钉被拔，突然脱轨颠覆，当时列车乘务员三人殒命。这一列车颠覆事件发生以后，美日反动派即动员所有御用的报纸、广播，一口咬定这是“日本共产党的破坏性的暴力行为”。接着便以这件事为借口，在松川逮捕了大批共产党员和进步的铁路工人，并且搜查了日本国营铁路（简称国铁）工会福岛支部与东京芝浦电气公司（简称东芝）松川工会的办公室，无理地没收文件书籍。在被捕者中，有“国铁”工会福岛支部委员长武田久，福岛分会委员长铃木信，与东芝电气公司松川工会委员长杉浦三郎等。他们都是当地工人运动的领导者。
    松川事件发生之前，正是美日反动派在“国铁”、“东芝”实行大量裁员，借故清洗进步职工的时候，一时“国铁”被裁人员达九万五千名之多。因此以“国铁”、“东芝”为中心，日本工人展开了全国规模的斗争。就在松川事件发生的前一天，“东芝”松川工会召开了工人大会，决定罢工一天。松川事件中不少被捕的人，就是那天勇敢地参加斗争的进步工人。
    美日反动派这一故意制造事件，借故含血喷人的谋害行为，深深激怒了日本劳动人民。在事件爆发以后，日本共产党福岛县委，和福岛县各人民团体，包括“国铁”、日本递信（邮电）工会的福岛分会，福岛县、区工会，“东芝”松川工会，以及农民联合团体——农业复兴会议的代表，组成了调查团，调查松川事件的真相，揭发美日反动派的阴谋，为被捕者声援。
    经过了一年的时间，美日反动派虽然没有找到任何确凿证据，却授意日本检察当局，于去年八月二十六日，根据捏造的罪名，要求将所谓“松川事件”的二十名被告中的十名处死刑，三名处无期徒刑，七名分别处十年半至十五年徒刑。然而事实很快地证明了：这一控告的荒谬无理，其所提控诉理由之纯属虚构，真正犯罪的不是日本共产党人和进步工人，而是美日反动派自己。
    松川事件检事在列举被捕者的罪名时说：“有人拿螺丝钳在黑夜拔掉了两个地方的道钉，其中一个地方的轨条完全松动，致使列车脱轨。”但是作为证据拿出来的螺丝钳，长度不到一公尺，“国铁”平常使用的要比这大三倍。而且在“国铁”福岛管理局提交仙台铁道局的事件报告书中说到：“一个螺丝钳，不可能拔动用百余吨力量压紧的道钉，而使列车脱轨。”
    作为检事提出的另一证据的赤间胜美自白书，在审判中经过被捕者们的公开揭露，证明这个自白书完全是非刑拷问和威胁利诱下的产物。被捕者们揭露：卑鄙无耻的日本警察署，由于日共党员的坚强不屈，不能从他们口中取得适合日本反动派要求的口供，便找那个尚未成年的非共产党员赤间胜美，对他进行了百般拷问，并威胁说：“如不自白，不是无期徒刑就是死刑。”等到虚构的自白书制成以后，赤间成了警察署的上宾，每天被款以烟、酒，洗澡时署长还给他洗背。
    更可笑的，检事提出列车脱轨是铃木信、佐藤一、高桥晴雄等共谋的事件。但是所谓共谋首犯的铃木信，在发生事变那天，整天都在福岛日共县委办公室。同一时间内佐藤一远在松川，高桥晴雄远在米泽，都相隔数日里以至数十日里（一日里约合六华里）。而且以上事实都获得充分证明。试问相隔几个地方的人，如何共同去颠覆列车呢？正如被捕者的辩护人冈林辰雄所说的，这岂不成了奇迹？！
    结果，这次无耻的审判，不但不能证实被难者的罪名，反而暴露了美日反动派处心积虑进攻日本工人阶级和劳动人民的险毒阴谋，使日本人民和世界人民，更认清了美日反动派的狰狞而阴险的面目。
    可是，尽管日本检察当局提不出任何足以构成被告犯罪行为的正当根据，福岛地方裁判所裁判长长尾，却于去年十二月六日判决铃木信等五人死刑，武田久等五人无期徒刑，其他十人三年半至十五年徒刑。这一无理的判决，引起日本人民对美日反动派的无比愤怒，与对被迫害者的同情和关切。据去年十二月八日日本联合通信社消息，宣判那天，旁听席上挤满了人群。当裁判长朗读判决书时，被捕者们发出了响亮的呼声：“反对卖国的裁判！”“请裁判长滚到海的那岸去！”并向旁听席高呼：“我们是无罪的，请放心，我们将斗争到底！”旁听席上的被捕者家属和群众也大声地回答说：“加油啊！谁也不会信任这样的判决！”最后整个法庭响彻了雄壮的国际歌歌声。狼狈不堪的裁判长，只好拿出宣布休庭的武器，把群众赶散。到下午继续开庭时，就不准旁听者入席。
    现在松川事件的被捕者，正准备向仙台裁判所提出上诉，如果在仙台裁判所不能胜诉，将继续向东京最高裁判所提出最后上诉。他们将与美日反动派战斗到底，保卫自己的生存权利。全中国全世界人民都认识：“松川事件”是美日反动派对日本工人阶级和劳动人民的有计划的进攻，是扫清武装日本道路上的障碍的一个步骤，是美帝国主义侵略计划的一部分，因此都热烈地来声援日本人民这个正义的斗争。
