　　China Democratic National Construction Association and China Zhi Gong Party Issue Statements
　　Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Four Proposals
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The China Democratic National Construction Association and the China Zhi Gong Party support Foreign Minister Zhou's reply to the First Committee of the United Nations. A spokesperson for the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a statement saying: All members of our association and patriotic figures in the national industrial and commercial circles have seen through the tricks of American imperialism and resolutely support the various proposals and negotiation principles put forward in Foreign Minister Zhou's reply. If American imperialism still refuses to repent and attempts to struggle to the death in Korea, we are determined to join the people of the whole country in supporting the Korean People's Army and our volunteer forces with more resolute practical actions, giving American imperialism a greater blow until the aggressive troops of American imperialism are completely expelled from Korea and Taiwan!
　　The statement issued by the China Zhi Gong Party stated: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's reply to the First Committee of the United Nations on the 17th of this month is a solemn expression of the Chinese people's determination and sincerity in striving for lasting world peace. In addition to our firm support, we also vow to take practical actions to promote its realization. The Chinese people will certainly provide support in all aspects for the heroic anti-imperialist struggle of the great Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
