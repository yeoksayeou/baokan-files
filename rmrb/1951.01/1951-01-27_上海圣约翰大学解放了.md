Shanghai St. John's University Liberated
	Bai Sheng
(1) The Struggle on the "Cultural Concession"
	Shanghai St. John's University has a history of seventy-two years and is one of the church universities that received American subsidies. Before the liberation of Shanghai, it was an American "cultural concession." Everything about it was controlled by the Americans. Not to mention the school's system and curriculum, even the language used in the school was English, and even Chinese history textbooks were foreign-written English textbooks, while the main course of the history department was Western history. American imperialism attempted to destroy the national consciousness of Chinese youth and deny Chinese language, history, culture, art, and way of life through such schools. According to their "logic," everything in China was "bad," and only the United States was "good." However, the American imperialists' conspiracy could not be fully realized. Although St. John's had produced lackeys like Song Ziwen and Gu Weijun and used them to carry out their cultural, political, and economic aggression against China, it also aroused the struggle of most students against cultural aggression and against slave education. The cultural opium peddled by the American imperialists could never poison patriotic students. The patriotic teachers and students of St. John's University have a glorious history of anti-imperialist struggle.
	As early as 1919, St. John's students, regardless of the unreasonable interference of the American president, bravely participated in the protest against Japanese imperialism and the traitor Yuan Shikai's signing of the "Twenty-One Demands" traitorous treaty. When the May 30th Massacre broke out in 1925, the patriotic teachers and students of St. John's resolutely threw themselves into the great anti-imperialist struggle. At that time, the American president of the school, Hawks Pott, unreasonably interfered with the students raising the flag, tore down the Chinese national flag, and said: "The school is run by the United States and is in the concession, so everything must be subject to me, the American president." This aroused the anger of the vast majority of Chinese teachers and students in the school, who collectively left the school and founded Guanghua University. On June 3, 1948, St. John's actively participated in the "Anti-American and Support Japan" movement, which made the American Consul in Shanghai and the head of the United States Information Service flustered and personally went to St. John's to investigate "un-American activities" and threatened: "It is absolutely intolerable for schools supported by the American economy to also have anti-American activities." At that time, the Chinese president of the school, Tu Yuqing, was forced to resign by James Pott (professor at the school, son of Hawks Pott), and James Pott himself became the acting president. After the "Anti-American and Support Japan" movement, James Pott wrote to Professor Pan Shizi of the school (Dean of Students when Tu Yuqing was president, who later resigned with Tu), asking him to hand over the "blacklist" of students who participated in the "Anti-American and Support Japan" movement, but Professor Pan refused.
(2) St. John's University After Liberation
	St. John's University has made rapid progress after liberation. After enthusiastic study, the political consciousness of the general students has been greatly improved. Some old professors never asked about politics in the past, but after liberation, seeing the prosperous atmosphere of New China, they were very moved and began to work hard to study politics. In the past, St. John's finances were completely controlled by the Americans, and income and expenditure were never made public, but after liberation, the Chinese could ask about it, and the economy was completely open. As soon as Shanghai was liberated, many progressive students joined the revolutionary work one after another. Under the influence and leadership of the old students who stayed at the school, the new students also made rapid progress. The school's work, under the close cooperation of the Party, the League, the trade union, the student union, and the administration, completely changed the past relatively free and undisciplined style. In the 1950 St. John's University regulations, there was such a clause regarding study discipline: "Teachers and students jointly teach and study for the construction of New China, transform their thinking, adopt a serious attitude, and change the past relatively free and lax teaching style; on the basis of the above, improve the enthusiasm of teaching and strengthen the effect of education."
	In this Resist America, Aid Korea movement, St. John's launched a large-scale struggle to eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression. When the US representative Austin insulted the Chinese people at the United Nations Security Council on November 28 last year, and took St. John's University as one of the physical evidences of "traditional friendship", it immediately aroused the roar of the teachers, students and staff of St. John's. The campus was full of big-character posters. Professor Wang Guoxiu of the History Department and Professor Wang Xinfu of the Chinese Language Department said in a statement: "We cannot forget our own history, especially the history of being invaded." Professor Pan Shizi published the notice from the American acting president James Pott asking him to open a "blacklist" after the Anti-American and Support Japan movement in 1948, so that all teachers, students, and staff of the school could better understand the ugly face of American imperialism. The entire school of St. John's also held patriotic and anti-American rallies for days, condemning the American imperialist slave education. Professors, students, and workers all made accusations against American imperialism. Professor Pan Shizi revealed that the school's past education system was not suitable for China's needs, that the actual power of school administration was in the hands of Americans, and that Chinese professors were discriminated against in terms of treatment. He said that now everyone can freely walk and play ball on the lawn in the school, but before liberation, Chinese people were not allowed to play tennis on the lawn, because Chinese people were not allowed to participate in the organization of the tennis club in the school. Professor Ni Baochun, who has worked at the school for twenty-two years, also angrily denounced Austin's sophistry and slander with his own personal experience. Mr. Wang Xinfu, a sixty-year-old professor of Chinese language, said: "American imperialism is particularly discriminatory against teachers of Chinese. At that time, when I should have received a raise, the American president did not give me a raise. He said: "Wait until you come back from studying abroad!" It's simply absurd to ask Chinese teachers to study abroad in the United States." Chen Xiushan, an old worker who has worked at the school for thirty-one years, and another worker, Yang Zuofeng, both used facts to accuse American imperialism of discriminating against Chinese workers. For example, American imperialism wanted all St. John's workers to wear vests of a certain form to show their identification, and stipulated dates for collective training and roll call, etc. The students of the school were even more filled with righteous indignation. Dai Keguang, a student of the Journalism Department, said: "I studied at St. John's Middle School and St. John's University, but I am not deceived by Austin and his ilk. I want to tell the American imperialists: 'I firmly respond to the government's call and sign up to join the National Defense Force!'" At the rally to send off students participating in the military cadre school, more than seventy professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants performed a self-written drama "Leaving School to Join the Army," fully demonstrating the spirit of great unity among all teachers and students of the school.
(3) A Bright Future
	After the Government Administration Council announced its decision on the policy of dealing with cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups accepting American subsidies, all teachers, students, and staff of St. John's University were extremely excited. Everyone unanimously expressed their firm support for this measure of the Government Administration Council, believing that this completely severed the shackles that American imperialism had placed on St. John's. St. John's University was completely and permanently liberated from now on.
	At this conference on handling foreign-funded higher education institutions convened by the Ministry of Education, Professor Pan Shizi, representing St. John's University, and Yang Kuanlin, representing the school board, and Lu Rushan, representing the trade union, all expressed with confidence that St. John's University has broken away from the American church relationship and embarked on a bright road, and guaranteed that they would definitely work hard to run St. John's well.

　　上海圣约翰大学解放了
    柏生
  （一）“文化租界”上的斗争
    上海圣约翰大学已有七十二年的历史，是接受美国津贴的教会大学之一。上海解放以前，它是美帝的“文化租界”。它的一切都受美国人的支配，学校的制度和课程固不必说，连校里通用的语言也是英语，连中国历史课本都是采用外国人写的英文课本，而历史系的主要课程是西洋史。美帝企图通过这样的学校来摧毁中国青年的民族意识，否定中国的语文、历史、文化、艺术和生活方式。照他们的“逻辑”，中国一切都“不好”，只有美国是“好”的。但美帝的阴谋是不可能完全实现的，在约大虽然曾制造出了像宋子文、顾维钧那一类的奴才，并通过他们实行其对中国的文化政治经济侵略，但同时也激起了大多数同学反对文化侵略、反对奴化教育的斗争。美帝所贩卖的文化雅片是决不能毒死爱国学生的。圣约翰大学的爱国师生们，有着光荣的反帝斗争的历史。
    远在一九一九年，约大学生不顾美国校长的无理干涉，勇敢地参加了抗议日本帝国主义和卖国贼袁世凯签订“二十一条”卖国条约。一九二五年五卅惨案爆发时，约大的爱国师生们毅然决然地投入了伟大的反帝斗争。当时该校美籍校长卜舫济（Hawks Pott）无理干涉同学们升旗，把中国国旗撕了下来，并说：“学校是美国办的，而又在租界里，一切须服从我美国校长。”于是激起了该校绝大多数的中国教员和学生的愤怒，他们集体离校，创办了光华大学。一九四八年六月三日，约大积极参加“反美扶日”运动，使得上海美国领事和美国新闻处处长急得手慌脚乱，亲自跑到约大来作“非美活动”的调查，并威吓说：“决不能容忍美国经济支持的学校也出现反美活动。”当时该校中国校长涂羽卿，被卜舫济之子卜其吉（James Pott，该校教授）逼迫辞职，而由卜其吉自己做代理校长。“反美扶日”运动后，卜其吉写信给该校潘世兹教授（涂羽卿任校长时的训导长，后随涂辞职），要他交出参加“反美扶日”运动的同学的“黑名单”，但被潘教授拒绝了。
  （二）解放后的约大
    解放后的约大，是进步很快的。经过热烈学习，一般同学的政治觉悟都大大提高了。有些老教授过去从不过问政治，但解放后看到新中国的兴旺气象，非常感动，也开始努力学习政治了。以前约大的财政是完全掌握在美国人手里，收支从不公开，但是解放后中国人可以过问了，经济完全公开。上海一解放，许多进步同学就纷纷参加了革命工作。新来的同学在留校老同学的影响带动之下，进步也很快。学校工作在党、团、工会、学生会和行政互相密切配合下，完全改变了过去比较自由散漫的作风。在一九五○年的约大规程上，关于学习纪律有这样一条：“师生共同为建设新中国而教学，改造思想，采取严肃态度，转移过去比较自由散漫与松懈之教学风气；在上述基础上，提高教学之积极性，加强教育之效果。”
    在这次抗美援朝运动中，约大大规模的展开了肃清美帝文化侵略影响的斗争。当去年十一月二十八日美国代表奥斯汀在联合国安全理事会上侮辱中国人民，并把约大作为“传统友谊”的物证之一时，立即激起了约大师生员工的怒吼。校园内贴满了大字报，历史系教授王国秀和中国语文系教授王欣夫等在声明中说：“我们不能忘却了自己的历史，尤其不能忘却了被侵略的历史。”潘世兹教授把一九四八年反美扶日运动后，美籍代理校长卜其吉叫他开“黑名单”的通知公布给大家看，使全校师生员工更认识了美帝的狰狞面目。约大全校并连日举行了爱国反美大会，控诉美帝的奴化教育，教授、学生、工友一致提出了对美帝的控诉。潘世兹教授揭发了该校过去教育制度不适合中国的需要，学校行政实权操在美国人手里，以及中国教授在待遇上遭受歧视等情形。他说现在大家可以在校内草地上自由散步、打球，但在解放前，中国人是不能够在草地上打网球的，因为学校内网球会的组织，中国人是不准参加的。在该校工作二十二年的倪葆春教授也以自己亲身的体验，愤怒地斥责了奥斯汀的狡赖和诬蔑。六十岁的中国语文系教授王欣夫先生说：“美帝对国文先生特别歧视，当时在我应加薪的时候，美国校长不给我加薪。他说：“等你留学回来再说吧！”叫国文教员到美国去留学，简直岂有此理。”在该校服务三十一年的老工友陈修善和另一工友杨作丰都用事实控诉了美帝对中国工友的歧视。譬如美帝要约大工友一律穿着一定形式的背心，以志识别，并且规定日期集训点名等。该校学生更是个个义愤填膺。新闻系学生戴可光说：“我从圣约翰中学读到圣约翰大学，但我并不受奥斯汀之流的欺骗。我要告诉美帝：‘我坚决响应政府号召，报名参加国防军！’”在欢送参加军事干校同学的大会上，全校七十多位教授和讲助教演出了自编的“投军别校”戏剧，充分地表现了全校师生大团结的精神。
  （三）光辉的前途
    政务院公布关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定后，约大全校师生员工都异常兴奋，大家一致热烈表示坚决拥护政务院的这个措施，认为从此完全斩断了美帝国主义扣在约大身上的一把枷锁。约大是从此彻底地、永远地解放了。
    在这次教育部召开的处理外国津贴的高等学校会议上，约大教授代表潘世兹和校董代表杨宽麟、工会代表陆如山等，都充满信心的表示：从此约大脱离了美国教会的关系，走上了光明的大道，并保证一定努力把约大办好。
