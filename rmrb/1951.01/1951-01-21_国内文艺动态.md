Domestic Literary and Art News

    The serial comic books compiled and drawn by the Popular Pictorial Publishing House have now published seventeen titles including Worker Zhang Feihu, Liu Hulan, Chicken Feather Letter, Wang Xiuluan, Jin Baoniang, Xiao Erhei's Marriage, Brother Hou and His Young Pioneers, Little Hero Eighth Route Army, Red Maid, Mulan Joins the Army, Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang, Yellow Mud Ridge, New Children's Heroes (Parts 1 & 2), Fugui, Meng Jiangnu, Can't Die, and The Story of Liu Sihu. The quality of these works is generally above average. Among them, Chicken Feather Letter, Mr. Dong Guo, and New Children's Heroes have achieved new successes in adaptation and drawing.
    The Shanghai "Xiaoshuo" (Fiction) Monthly, starting from Volume 4, is distributed by the Commercial Press, and starting from Volume 4, Issue 5, it is edited by the Shanghai Branch of the All-China Federation of Literary Workers. This is one of the more carefully edited and good literary periodicals, and it is worth recommending to the national literary and art circles.
    The China Youth Art Theatre's recent performance of "Fang Zhenzhu" (Fang Pearl), from its debut to the 14th, according to incomplete statistics: city residents accounted for more than 40%, including cattle slaughterers, vegetable sellers, small business people, used clothing sellers... The reaction is especially good among performers. Liang Xiaolou said: "This play coincides too much with my own experience." Wei Xikui said: "The Fang Tai Tai (Mrs. Fang) in the play is like my mother." Guo Xiaoxia said: "This play reminds me of my past, and I cried several times." Crosstalk artist Gao Deming said with great emotion: "Although I am illiterate, I know good from bad. Our government looks up to us like this. I know I have to be strong, and I hope the advanced members and comrades in the literary and art circles will help me more." The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture recently held a symposium for this play. Everyone praised the performance of "Fang Zhenzhu" and offered suggestions for improvement on certain minor shortcomings of the play.
    In the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, the national music circles launched a patriotic song creation movement. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of December, more than 290 songs had been published in newspapers, and the total number, including those published in journals, was estimated to be over 1,100. The authors of these songs include not only workers, students, and primary and secondary school music teachers, but also many famous musicians who had not written for a long time have taken up their pens again to participate in this movement. The forms of these creations include unison, solo, chorus, round, and rap, etc., but march-style unison songs are the most numerous, and narrative songs and duets that are more popular with the masses are relatively few, which should be improved.
    From November 24th to December 24th last year, the Beijing film industry launched a film propaganda month for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting the home, and defending the country. In one month, the audience reached more than 600,000 people, and more than 30 films were screened. These included 19 Soviet films such as "The Fall of Berlin," "The Great Turn," "They Have a Homeland," and "Danya," one Korean film "My Hometown," and 12 domestic films such as "Zhao Yiman," "Heroes of Lüliang," "Battle of Hainan Island," and "Defend the Country and Protect the Home." Not only were "News Briefs" added to each screening, but also 165 early shows were added, and 160 new folk art performances and 150 continuous slide shows were added before the early shows, which were very popular with the masses. At the same time, an anti-American, aid-Korea, protect-the-home, and defend-the-country cartoon exhibition was held in the lobbies of 16 cinemas; loudspeakers were installed in 13 cinemas to broadcast news about resisting America and aiding Korea to the audience; street slogans for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting the home, and defending the country were painted, leaflets were distributed, and film window exhibitions were held. The development of this movement has been very helpful in stimulating the patriotism and internationalism of the masses.
    Northeast Xinhua Bookstore, Xinhua Bookstore East China General Branch, and Shanghai's Qiming, Children's and other bookstores have recently published some children's literature readings. "The Story of a Child's Emancipation" by Hong Lin, "Little Girl" by Dai Shiming, "Stories of Resisting America and Aiding Korea" by He Yi and others, and "Settling Accounts with the American Imperialists" by Shi Ying, published by Qiming Bookstore, are all relatively good works. Xinhua Bookstore East China General Branch has also published many Soviet translations, including "The Newcomer" by Pantaleev, and "The Cottage Under the Birch Trees" by Vasilevskaya.

　　国内文艺动态
    大众图画出版社所编绘的连环图画，现在已经出版了工人张飞虎、刘胡兰、鸡毛信、王秀鸾、金宝娘、小二黑结婚、侯哥弹和他的少年队、英雄小八路、红娘子、木兰从军、三打祝家庄、黄泥岗、新儿女英雄传（第一、二集）、福贵、孟姜女、死不着、刘四虎的故事等十七种。这些作品的质量，大都在一般水平之上。其中，鸡毛信、东郭先生、新儿女英雄传数种，在改编及绘制上都有新的成就。
    上海“小说”月刊自第四卷起改由商务印书馆发行，自第四卷第五期起改由中华全国文学工作者协会上海分会编辑，这是编得比较谨严的好的文学期刊之一，值得向全国文艺界推荐。
    中国青年艺术剧院最近正在上演的“方珍珠”从一日上演起到十四日止，据不完全的统计：市民观众占百分之四十以上，其中有宰牛的，卖菜的，做小生意的，卖估衣的……尤其在艺人方面，反映很好。良小楼说：“这个戏与我自己的遭遇太吻合了。”魏喜奎说：“戏里的方太太像我妈。”郭小霞说：“这个戏使我想起了我的过去，我哭了好几次。”相声艺人高德明很感动地说：“我虽然大字不识，可也懂得好坏，我们的政府这样的看得起我们。我知道要强，我希望文艺界的先进和同志们多多帮助我。”北京市文艺处最近曾为这戏举行座谈会。大家均对“方珍珠”的演出表示赞扬，并对该剧的某些小缺点，提出改进意见。
    在抗美援朝的运动中，全国音乐界发起了爱国歌曲的创作运动。根据不完全的统计到十二月底止，发表在报纸上的歌曲有二百九十余首，加上刊物上发表的，总数约计一千一百首以上。这些歌曲的作者不但包括工人、学生、中小学音乐教师，而且好多久已不写作的名音乐家也都重新拿起笔来，参加了这个运动。这些创作的形式包括了齐唱、独唱、合唱、轮唱、说唱等，但以进行曲风的齐唱歌曲为最多，较少群众喜爱的叙事歌和对唱曲，这是应该加以改进的。
    自去年十一月二十四日至十二月二十四日，北京电影界发动了一个抗美援朝保家卫国电影宣传月的运动。一个月内观众达六十余万人，共放映了三十多部影片。其中有苏联名片“攻克柏林”、“大转变”、“他们有祖国”、“丹娘”等十九部，朝鲜片“我的故乡”一部及国产片“赵一曼”、“吕梁英雄”、“大战海南岛”、“卫国保家”等十二部。各院不但每场加演了“新闻简报”，而且加演了早场一六五场，并于早场放映前加演了新曲艺一六○场与连续幻灯一五○场，颇受群众欢迎。与此同时，在十六家影院前厅举行了抗美援朝保家卫国漫画展览；在十三家影院按装扩音器，向观众广播抗美援朝的新闻；绘制了抗美援朝保家卫国宣传的街头标语，散发了传单，并举办了影片壁窗展览。这一运动的开展，对激发群众的爱国主义与国际主义精神很有帮助。
    东北新华书店、新华书店华东总分店和上海的启明、儿童等书店最近都出版了一些儿童文学读物。像新华书店华东总分店出版的洪林作的“一个孩子翻身的故事”，戴石明作的“小妮儿”、启明书店出版的贺宜等人作的“抗美援朝的故事”和施瑛作的“跟美帝算账”，都是比较好的作品。新华书店华东总分店还出版了苏联的翻译作品多种，有班台莱耶夫著的“新来的”、华西列夫斯卡亚著的“白桦树下的茅屋”等。
