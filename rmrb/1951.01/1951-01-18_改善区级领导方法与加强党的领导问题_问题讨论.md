　　Discussion on Improving District-Level Leadership Methods and Strengthening Party Leadership
　　Editor's Note: Since we published Comrade Hou Yong's article "Transforming the District-Level All-Encompassing Leadership Method" on December 14th last year, we have received letters from some readers requesting a thorough resolution of this issue. Later, we received different opinions from readers regarding this issue. We plan to publish these opinions successively to facilitate discussion. We hope that relevant readers, especially comrades from Party committees at all levels, will participate in this discussion.
　　
　　Editor,
　　
　　I am writing down my opinions on transforming the district-level all-encompassing leadership method below for everyone's discussion.
　　
　　First, we should acknowledge the actual situation of having fewer cadres and heavier workloads at the grassroots level. For example, among the cadres in my county, new cadres account for more than 80 percent, most of whom were promoted after 1948 and are activists from the land reform movement. These comrades are very enthusiastic and responsible in their work, but their policy level and cultural level are low (not to mention theoretical level), and their practical work experience is not much. Therefore, the work efficiency of these people is not high, especially their understanding of some principled issues in their work is very vague. For example, they turn a blind eye to village cadres' coercive orders or landlords' counterattacks, while getting bogged down in individual disputes among the masses. On the other hand, the work tasks are heavy. Last winter and this spring, there were four major work tasks centered on production—production, Party consolidation and political construction, suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, and rectification and education. In addition, each district needs to regularly prepare various statistical forms and work reports for the higher authorities, and the higher authorities also occasionally transfer some cadres for short-term training. This further increases the difficulty of completing work tasks. Thus, there is a tendency for stronger district committee cadres to replace and take over all work. Therefore, in the future, we should first require the leadership to reduce unnecessary official documents and forms and avoid transferring cadres for piecemeal training. If it is necessary to transfer cadres for study, the duration can be longer (one or two years) so as not to hinder the work below. However, to completely solve the problem of the Party substituting for the government, it is of course necessary to change the original leadership method.
　　
　　Secondly, while we must overcome the leadership method of the Party substituting for the government, we must also prevent the state of laissez-faire where each does things in their own way. Such deviations have already occurred in some places in my county. The most serious of these is that some district committees have abandoned the Party's leadership over government work, letting it drift. Some government cadres mistakenly believe that the Party's past leadership over government work was wrong. They have not recognized that the Party's leadership over government work is correct; the mistake lies in the fact that some Party committees in the past adopted the method of taking over and substituting for government work. Although the leadership has repeatedly pointed this out after these problems were discovered, and a review was conducted during the rectification campaign, the state of laissez-faire in some places has not been overcome. Although the leadership is very clear about this issue, it cannot be implemented. All departments should carry out their work around production, but once they go down to the grassroots level, they each do their own central work, not asking about production. We recently inspected winter production and discovered a serious laissez-faire phenomenon. This is for a reason: if they fail to complete the work of their departments, they will be criticized by the higher authorities; if they fail to complete the central work (especially production), the higher authorities will not criticize them. On the other hand, the phenomenon of only doing central work and not doing departmental work in some places is of course also incorrect.
　　
　　So, how do we solve the problem of the Party substituting for the government? I suggest adopting the method of reducing departmental meetings and organizing joint offices of the Party, government, and people. Although the newspaper introduced the method of using neighborhood cadres to assist cadres due to insufficient staff, it is good, but there is a difficulty, that is, it is impossible to solve their food supply problem. Some also say that as long as the people's representative conferences at all levels are held well, there will be strength. However, the people's representatives can only represent the opinions of the people and reflect and suggest to the leadership; then transmit and implement the government's policies and decrees to the masses, and play some exemplary role in the implementation. They cannot do much concrete work; at the same time, there are still many formalistic phenomena in the people's representative conferences in many districts and villages. Therefore, in addition to enabling neighborhood cadres to assist in the work as much as possible and giving full play to the role of the people's representative conferences, I think the majority of the district-level forces should be concentrated on doing concrete work well. In order to unify leadership and maintain consistent steps, departmental meetings should be reduced as much as possible (of course, regular departmental meetings are not included), and joint offices of the Party, government, and people should be organized to collectively study work. This office can be composed of one district head or district government secretary, one person from mass organizations, and one person from the Party committee. Their task is to collectively study and guide the central work, and divide the work to solve the specific work problems of the departments. At the same time, the statistics and central work reports of each department can also be unified. I don't think this can be regarded as an all-encompassing leadership method, but rather a concrete manifestation of strengthening unified leadership.
　　
　　Regarding this issue (transforming the district-level all-encompassing leadership method), we will organize further discussions later and send the opinions of the discussions in the future.

### 改善区级领导方法与加强党的领导问题  问题讨论

　　改善区级领导方法与加强党的领导问题
    问题讨论
    编者按：自从去年十二月十四日，我们发表了侯永同志的《转变区级一揽子领导方法》一文后，即接到一些读者来信，要求彻底地解决这一问题；以后又接到了读者对于这一问题不同的意见。我们计划把这些意见陆续发表，以便展开讨论。希望有关读者，特别是各级党委同志来参加这一讨论。
    编辑同志：
    现在把我对转变区级一揽子领导方法的意见写在下面，供大家讨论。
    首先应该承认下面干部少，工作繁重的实际情况。例如我县干部中，新干部就占百分之八十以上，其中大部分是一九四八年以后提拔出来的，是一些土地改革运动中的积极分子。这些同志对工作很热情很负责，但他们的政策水平和文化水平很低（还谈不到有理论水平），实际工作经验也不多，因此这些人的工作效率是不高的，特别是对工作中一些原则问题认识非常模糊。例如他们对村干部的强迫命令或地主反攻等重大问题熟视无睹；而纠缠在群众的个别纠纷问题上。另一方面，工作任务是繁重的，去冬今春就有以生产为中心的四大工作任务——生产、整党建政、镇压反革命分子活动、整顿教育等。又加每个区都需要经常的给上级作各种统计表格、作工作报告和上级也不时的要抽调一些干部去受短期训练。这样更给完成工作任务增加了困难。于是形成了由较强的区委等干部代替包办一切工作的倾向。因此今后首先要求领导上减少不必要的公文表格和不要零碎抽调干部轮训。如果必要调干部学习，时间可长一些（一年或二年），这样不致妨碍下面的工作。但是要彻底解决以党代政的问题，当然还须改变原来的领导方法。
    其次，我们固然要克服以党代政的领导方法，但也须防止各自为政的自流状态。我县有些地方已发生这样的偏向。其中最严重的是有的区委放弃了党对政府工作的领导，任其自流。有的区政权干部误认为过去党对政府工作的领导是错了的。没有认识到党对政府工作的领导是正确的；错误的地方在于过去有的党委对政府工作采取了包办代替的方法。这些问题发现后，虽然领导上一再予以指出，整风中又作了检查，但是某些地方的自流状态并未克服。这个问题领导上虽然很明确，可是贯彻不下去。一切部门应围绕生产进行工作，但一到下边就各作各的中心工作，不问生产。我们最近检查了一下冬季生产，发现了严重的自流现象。这是有原因的：他们如果完不成部门工作，就要受上级批评；完不成中心工作（特别是生产），上级不会批评。另方面也有些地方只做中心工作不作部门工作的现象当然也是不对的。
    那末怎样解决以党代政的问题呢？我建议采用减少部门会议，组织党、政、民集体办公的方法。报纸上虽然介绍了使用小区干部辅助干部不足的方法，好是好，但有个困难，就是无法解决他们的吃粮问题。还有的说，只要开好各界人民代表会，就有了力量。但是人民代表只能代表人民的意见，向领导上反映、建议；再把政府的政策法令传达和贯彻到群众中去，自己在执行中起一些模范作用。他们还不能作多少具体工作；同时现在还有很多区村人民代表会有形式主义现象。因此我觉得除使小区干部尽量协助工作和充分发挥人民代表会的作用外，应该是集中区级大部分力量做好具体工作。为了统一领导，步调一致，应该尽可能地减少部门会议（当然定期的部门会议不包括在内），组织党、政、民的集体办公室集体研究工作。这种办公室可以由区长或区政府秘书一人，群众团体一人，党委一人等组成。他们的任务是集体研究指导中心工作，分工解决部门的具体工作问题。同时各部门做统计数字和中心工作报告也能统一起来了。我想这不能算是一揽子的领导方法，而是加强统一领导的具体表现。
    关于这个问题（转变区级一揽子领导方法），以后我们还要组织讨论，将来把讨论的意见寄去。
