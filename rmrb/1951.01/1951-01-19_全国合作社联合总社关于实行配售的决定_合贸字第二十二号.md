The All-China Federation of Cooperatives, with the strong support of state-owned commerce, has decided to implement a system of fixed-quantity and fixed-price rationing for its members on a trial basis, starting in the first quarter of 1951. It has also stipulated the "Provisional Measures for Cooperative Rationing in the First Quarter of 1951." All localities should, based on the conditions outlined in the provisional measures, carefully select key rationing targets in several urban consumer cooperatives and rural supply and marketing cooperatives, and actively and resolutely implement this decision. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives is prepared to revise these provisional measures based on the experience of the first quarter of rationing, and to expand the implementation of the fixed-quantity and fixed-price rationing system nationwide in a planned and step-by-step manner. This is an extremely important measure that fully meets the requirements of the current situation and the needs of cooperative members.

The direct purpose of implementing rationing is to ensure that cooperative members can regularly, evenly, and reliably obtain a certain quantity of essential supplies at relatively low prices. The types of rationed goods are specified separately, taking into account the different living conditions in the South, North, Northeast, and Northwest, as well as in urban and rural areas, and the state's control of materials. The types are not numerous, but they are all daily necessities and can be regularly guaranteed. This will provide a certain degree of stability to the lives of cooperative members. At the same time, in order to ensure that the vast majority of members can enjoy the benefits of rationing equally, and to prevent the quantity of rationed goods from exceeding the needs of members and flowing into the free market, the quantitative standards for various rationed goods are stipulated according to the principle of "roughly sufficient, with a slight shortfall." The shortfall can be adjusted through the general retail business of the cooperatives. The rationed prices are required to be significantly lower than retail market prices and state-owned retail prices, in order to reduce the difference between wholesale and retail prices and between urban and rural prices, so that members can truly enjoy the benefits of rationing. According to the preferential discounts given by state-owned commerce for rationing, as long as cooperatives strengthen their business management, reduce wholesale levels, strictly economize on expenses, and do not charge high handling fees and profits, the regular, low-priced, and fixed-quantity rationing can be fully guaranteed.

The implementation of rationing must be closely integrated with the current work of rectifying cooperatives. The implementation of rationing is a very powerful lever to promote the cooperatives to get on the right track in terms of business and organization. Therefore, the provisions of Article 4 of the provisional measures must be strictly implemented. Grassroots cooperatives must meet the conditions proposed in that article in order to enjoy rationing benefits; those that do not meet these conditions will not be rationed, and must be rectified before they can enjoy the right to rationing. Cooperatives at all levels must adhere to this principle in order to correct the direction of business, shift from facing the market to facing the members, and implement the policy of "higher-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives, and grassroots cooperatives serving members."

Rationing is a strict and planned retail business. The rationing targets are limited to members only, so it can and must be a statistically and planned average distribution. The implementation of rationing can strengthen the planning of cooperative work, and improve cooperative commerce from the current state of disorganization and lack of planning. The implementation and promotion of the rationing system also expands organized and planned trade in the commodity circulation process, and reduces the blind and disorganized market. This can have a positive effect on stabilizing prices and securing people's livelihoods.

Rationing is not a simple distribution, but a very systematic economic organizational work. It is necessary to investigate and statistically analyze the perennial needs of members in various regions and different occupations, formulate plans monthly and quarterly without delay, and dispatch funds and materials according to the plans, calculate carefully, accurately grasp the rationing prices, and supply various rationed goods in a timely manner according to the seasons of the items needed by the members and the dates of employee salary payments. It is necessary to carefully and meticulously check every link of the rationing work according to the plan, strictly and impartially implement the provisions of Article 9 regarding rationing discipline, pay attention to preventing various possible malpractices, and severely punish staff who are corrupt, show favoritism, or fail to implement the decision. No slightest bit of bureaucracy and liberalism is allowed, so that the rationing work can be done well, making it convenient for all members, and making them admire the fairness of the cooperative staff.

Finally, it must be pointed out that whether rationing can be effective and whether it can win the support of the vast majority of members mainly depends on whether rationing relies on the members for implementation, whether the members participate in the various decisions related to rationing, and whether the democracy of the cooperative has been truly realized. Therefore, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives at all levels must convey the All-China Federation of Cooperatives' decision on implementing rationing and the provisional measures for the first quarter to all staff and members, and launch discussions to widely solicit opinions, so that everyone can guarantee the implementation of the rationing work.

　　全国合作社联合总社关于实行配售的决定
    合贸字第二十二号
    全国合作社联合总社在国营贸易有力的支持之下，决定自一九五一年第一季开始对社员试行定量定价配售，并规定了“一九五一年第一季合作社配售暂行办法”，各地应根据暂行办法中提出的条件，在若干城市消费合作社和农村供销合作社中慎重选择配售重点，积极坚决执行这一决定，全国合作总社准备根据第一季配售经验，修正这一暂行办法，并在全国范围内有计划有步骤地扩大推行定量定价配售制。这是完全符合目前形势要求和合作社社员需要的一个极其重要的措施。
    实行配售的直接目的是使合作社社员可以经常地，平均地，有保证地得到一定数量和比较廉价的必需品的供应。配售品的种类是参照南方北方东北西北与城市农村生活条件的不同，和国家掌握物资的情况，分别加以规定的。种类不多，但都是日用必需品，而且可以经常保证。这就可以使社员生活得到一定程度的安定。同时为使广大社员平均享受配售的优待，并为防止配售数量超过社员需要而流入自由市场，所以各种配售品的定量标准都是根据“大体够，稍有不足”的原则规定的，其不足部分可由合作社一般零售业务加以调剂。配售价格则要求必须显著地低于零售市价和国营零售价格，以缩小批发和零售差价及城乡差价，使社员真正享受到配售的利益。依照国营贸易对配售的优待折扣计算，只要合作社加强经营管理，减少批发层次，严格节约开支，不抽收高额手续费和利润，就完全可以保证经常廉价定量配售的实行。
    实行配售必须与目前整顿合作社的工作密切结合进行。实行配售就是促使合作社在业务上和组织上走上正轨的一个极有力的杠杆。因此必须严格执行暂行办法第四条的规定，基层合作社必须具备该条所提出的条件才能享受配售优待；不具备这些条件的不予配售，必须整顿好之后才能享受配售的权利。各级合作社必须坚持这一原则，才能端正业务方向，从面向市场转到面向社员，贯彻“上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务”的方针。
    配售是一种严格的有计划的零售业务。配售对象只限于社员，因而它可以而且必须是有统计有计划的平均分配。实行配售可以加强合作社工作的计划性，使合作社商业从目前无组织无计划的状态向上提高一步。而实行和推广配售制也就是在商品流通过程中扩大了有组织有计划的贸易，缩小了盲目的无组织的市场。这对于稳定物价，安定民生可以发生良好的作用。
    配售不是简单的分配，而是很有系统的经济组织工作。必须调查统计各地和各种不同职业的社员常年需要，不失时节地按月按季编制计划，并根据计划调度资金，调运物资，精打细算，正确掌握配售价格，按照社员所需物品的季节，职工发薪的日期，及时地供应各种配售品。必须根据计划认真地仔细地检查配售工作的每一环节，严格地大公无私地执行第九条关于配售纪律的规定，注意防止可能发生的各种弊端，对贪污腐化，私情照顾，不执行决定的工作人员予以严厉处分，不允许一丝一毫的官僚主义和自由主义，才能将配售工作作好，使得社员人人称便，并佩服合作社工作人员的公道。
    最后必须指出，配售能否行之有效，能否获得广大社员的拥护，主要决定于配售是否依靠社员来进行，社员是否参与有关配售的各项决定，是否真正实现了合作社的民主。因此，各级合作总社及基层社必须向全体工作人员和社员传达全国合作总社关于实行配售的决定和第一季度的暂行办法，并展开讨论，广泛征求意见，由大家来保证配售工作的贯彻执行。
