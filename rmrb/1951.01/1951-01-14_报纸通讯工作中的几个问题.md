Several Issues in Newspaper Correspondence Work

　　The further development of correspondence work, especially the expansion of the worker-peasant correspondent movement, was a significant advancement in national newspaper work in 1950.

　　Over the past six months, our main experience in correspondence work has been that although the cultural level of our worker-peasant masses is not high, worker-peasant correspondents can still be developed and can achieve results. The expansion of the worker-peasant correspondent movement will greatly improve our newspapers and bring great vitality.

　　Active members of the worker and peasant masses are enthusiastic and proud to serve as newspaper correspondents. More than 100 active members among the worker correspondents of the "Luda Workers' Daily" take turns going to the newspaper office almost every day after work to study writing and chat; like special reporters of the newspaper, they are stationed in a factory to write articles. The newspaper sends them reporting outlines every month, and they always complete and exceed the plan. A few months ago, the newspaper promoted a worker to be a trainee reporter, and his work attitude and performance were very good. Statistics from the "Changchun Daily" show that worker correspondents account for about 50% of all their correspondents, and more than 50% of worker correspondents play a role, while only one-third of non-worker correspondents play a role. Despite their relatively low cultural level, worker-peasant correspondents can write articles of great significance due to their concrete experiences in actual work. The "New Hunan Daily" received some articles from worker-peasant correspondents, some of which did raise important issues in the work at that time. For example, after the new grain was on the market, peasant articles raised the issue of low grain prices hurting farmers; during the rectification of peasant associations, peasant articles raised the bias of middle peasants occupying the main leadership positions of peasant associations. These articles enabled the cadres of the "New Hunan Daily" to further recognize the importance of developing worker-peasant correspondents. All these situations prove that the role of worker-peasant correspondents is indeed extremely significant, the expansion of the worker-peasant correspondent movement is indeed the most important direction and method to improve newspaper work, and over the past six months, our newspapers have indeed made some achievements in attracting a wide range of worker-peasant activists to participate in newspaper work.

　　However, from a national perspective, the expansion of the worker-peasant correspondent movement is still uneven. Many problems are reflected in the existing achievements that have not been well resolved. We still have some major points that are not very clear in our thinking on developing the worker-peasant correspondent movement; there are still some shortcomings and difficulties in the organization and leadership of the correspondence network, and in the use of correspondents; solving these problems will become an important key to further developing the worker-peasant correspondent movement.

　　What is the main political significance of worker-peasant correspondents? Comrade Stalin taught us: "Only worker-peasant correspondents can realize this great transformation," that is, "to make such a sharp weapon of class struggle as the newspaper able to change from a weapon of enslaving the people to a weapon of liberating the people." What is the basis for such a highly principled statement? Many people's understanding of this point is not deep. When our newspaper staff discuss the significance of developing worker-peasant correspondents, they often focus on the role of worker-peasant correspondents in news reporting, and the main point of contention is often focused on criticizing the erroneous understanding that worker-peasant correspondents cannot make "comprehensive and guiding" reports, and therefore are unwilling or unable to patiently develop worker-peasant correspondents. This point is very important, since one of the main shortcomings of our newspapers is the lack of vivid news reports reflecting the actual conditions of the life and production of the working people, in order to improve our news reporting, so that new and advanced things in society can be quickly reflected in the newspapers, worker-peasant correspondents can indeed become a remedy for the right disease. But the main political significance of worker-peasant correspondents is not just this point.

　　The most important political significance of worker-peasant correspondents lies first in their role as representatives and transmitters of the public opinion of the working people, as the mass force and main force for newspapers to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and as the only reliable basis for implementing mass supervision of public opinion. No one can deny that our newspapers are basically people's newspapers, which are fundamentally different from all old newspapers. In the present society, it is impossible and impossible to allow newspapers to exist as "weapons for enslaving the people." But this is only the beginning of a great transformation. If newspapers are to become truly "weapons for liberating the people," the wishes and efforts of newspaper staff and their leading organs alone are far from enough. The key to the problem is that newspapers must be specifically in the hands of the working people themselves, so that newspapers can truly be filled with the voices, demands, and public opinion of the people. And worker-peasant correspondents are the most basic and irreplaceable way to achieve this requirement. Worker-peasant correspondents establish a concrete and regular link between the people and the newspapers, transmit the public opinion of the people to the newspapers, and become uncompromising exposers of the shortcomings and errors in various practical work, so that the newspapers can become a fighting weapon against all old, backward, degenerate ideas, consciousness, and behaviors that hinder social progress. Without a broad range of worker-peasant activists serving as correspondents, it would be tantamount to cutting off the direct and concrete link between the newspapers and the masses, it cannot be guaranteed that they will truly become the people's own newspapers, and it cannot be guaranteed that their eyes will not be blinded by the fog of bureaucracy, commandism, and the like.

　　The main political significance of worker-peasant correspondents is such. If worker-peasant correspondents do not play the role of representatives and transmitters of the public opinion of the working people, they cannot become the "significant political force" that Stalin spoke of.

　　Among the worker-peasant correspondents already organized by newspapers in various places, some activists have bravely taken on the task of "exposing social shortcomings." Criticism articles from worker-peasant correspondents in the newspapers have become an important part of the newspapers in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and there have been some vivid examples in this regard. However, the role played by worker-peasant correspondents in this regard is still not large, and not the majority of correspondents can recognize their role in this regard. The main reason for this phenomenon is that many newspaper workers have a one-sided understanding of the political significance of worker-peasant correspondents. The reason why worker-peasant correspondents become the main link for newspapers to connect with the masses and connect with reality is that they are the representatives and transmitters of mass public opinion, reporters of vivid and fresh things, and reflectors of the ideological situation of the masses.

　　What conclusions should be drawn from this? The conclusion should be that the conditions that should be given priority when developing worker-peasant correspondents are not their cultural level and writing ability, but the heartfelt concern for the people's cause, the sensitivity to new things and sincere love, especially the uncompromising spirit towards shortcomings and errors. In the work of cultivating and educating worker-peasant correspondents, the first thing that should be emphasized is not the training of news writing techniques (although this is also necessary), but the enlightenment and exercise of the aforementioned political qualities. The debate about whether the articles of worker-peasant correspondents are one-sided and trivial should of course also be resolved, but merely solving these problems cannot guide the worker-peasant correspondent movement in the right direction.

　　After the correspondents are developed, there are still some problems in their organization and leadership.

　　Correspondents are an organized force, and only by forming a correspondent network throughout the country can the power of correspondents be maximized, and the newspapers can truly connect with reality and connect with the masses. However, the active members of the masses who serve as correspondents for the newspaper should be completely conscious, and the correspondent network should not rely on any other organization, and the correspondents should not have a fixed organizational relationship with the newspaper, as if once they serve as correspondents, they must be subject to some organizational constraints. Therefore, the newspaper cannot rely on other forces in developing correspondents, but can only rely on the editorial department's own well-organized mass work, first of all individual interviews and communication links. The primary responsibility of every newspaper worker and every reporter stationed in various places is to do this mass work.

　　However, some of our newspapers do not yet understand that making the greatest effort to strengthen mass work is the only and most effective way for newspapers to organize worker-peasant correspondents. Relying on some organization to develop correspondents often becomes the main way, and some newspapers even take administrative orders when developing correspondents, and determine that he is a correspondent without getting the other party's consent at all. Many nominal correspondents who do not play a role are often produced because of this. It is necessary to change this way of working with great perseverance. Secondly, in the leadership of the correspondent network, some new problems have emerged with the editorial department's implementation of the integrated organization form and working method of editing, interviewing, and communication, resulting in a phenomenon of "decentralized management" and loose leadership, the result of which is that the editorial department cannot carry out mass work well. This phenomenon must be corrected. The original purpose of implementing the integration of editing, interviewing, and communication was to overcome the phenomenon of hindering connection with reality caused by the mutual separation of these three types of work, but in addition to a small number of correspondents with professional division of labor, most general correspondents do not often know how the editorial department's groups are divided, and which group should be responsible for handling which type of manuscript. If there is no appropriate department to be responsible for this aspect of the work, the correspondents will have a sense of helplessness. Now some newspapers have implemented the method of setting up a local correspondence group (or reader's letter group) parallel to the editorial department's groups, specializing in leading local correspondents, to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings. This method is more feasible in the case where the reporter network of various newspapers has not been established.

　　The leadership of a wide-ranging correspondent network must rely on the efforts of all the editorial department staff. Reporters have a particularly important responsibility in this regard. Reporters who interview a certain department should be responsible for leading the correspondents of that department, and special reporters stationed in a certain area should also be responsible for leading the correspondent network in that area. The Soviet newspapers have very clear regulations in this regard. The Central Committee of the CPSU wrote in its resolution: "...Organizing a wide range of active authors outside the editorial department around the newspaper, and absorbing the staff of party, Soviet, and economic organizations, Soviet intellectuals, workers, and rural correspondents to participate in the work of the newspaper is the primary task of the local special reporters." Only in this way can we get rid of the correspondent network's dependence on certain organs and make it an independent force representing the public opinion of the people.

　　But to realize such a leadership method requires a great transformation in our interview and communication work methods. One of the important problems in our communication work is that there are great shortcomings in the use of the correspondent force, in the position of communication work in newspaper editing work, and in the relationship with interview work. Many newspaper staff are arguing about "who is first, the reporter or the correspondent," some reporters not only do not help and develop correspondents, but also regard correspondents as only people who provide news clues. If the correspondent writes a news clue, the reporter rushes to write it, or the important news is written by himself, leaving only the secondary news for the correspondent to write. And the communication staff of the newspaper therefore produced an undue sense of inferiority, saying "one reporter, two editors, three communication," as if communication work is a very unimportant work. This phenomenon is quite common, it greatly limits the enthusiasm of correspondents, and becomes a serious obstacle to the development of worker-peasant correspondents, and must be resolutely corrected.

　　The work of correspondents and reporters is different. Reporters are professional news workers, they should have very high professional skills, and at the same time have a very wide contact surface, therefore, they should have higher requirements for themselves in performing reporting tasks. Seizing the news clues of correspondents, or competing to write news reports that correspondents can write, is a manifestation of the reporter not doing his job well, it is the reporter's dereliction of duty, this is one aspect. More importantly, the reporter is not only a simple interviewer, but should mainly be an organizer, his main job should be to organize correspondents to conduct reporting. Reporters are few in number anyway, he cannot replace correspondents to conduct all the more important reports, therefore, organizing a good and wide range of correspondent network should become the main force of the newspaper's reporting work, and the reporter in reporting is only the elite and assault force in this main force. This requires a major change in the thinking of the leaders and staff of the newspaper editorial department, establish the idea of relying on correspondents and following the mass line, put the use of the correspondent force in the primary position, and when evaluating the work of reporters, first look at his achievements in performing organizational tasks, rather than how many news reports he has written. Without this transformation, the enthusiasm of correspondents cannot be developed, which has now become one of the main obstacles to carrying out communication work.

　　After this transformation is implemented, the composition of the newspaper correspondent network will show a new face, so that the correspondents can get rid of the reliance on other organs, and become an independent force concentratedly led by the editorial department, and this connection and leadership can be consolidated through the editorial department's well-organized mass work. In this way, gradually transfer the correspondent stations (groups) originally led by various local organs to the local special reporters of the newspaper to organize and contact, the reporter network of the newspaper is also the correspondent network, which will not only be of great benefit to strengthening communication reporting, but also will promote great progress in developing the combat role of worker-peasant correspondents and carrying out mass criticism and self-criticism.

　　In short, clearly recognizing the main political significance of worker-peasant correspondents, correctly using the correspondent force, and improving the organization and leadership of the correspondent network are the main issues to improve and further expand communication work on the existing basis. In order to welcome the greater improvement of newspaper work in 1951, the above opinions are specially put forward for the reference of newspaper workers in various places.

　　报纸通讯工作中的几个问题
    通讯工作的进一步展开，尤其是工农通讯员运动的展开，是一九五○年全国报纸工作上的一个重大的进步。
    半年多以来，我们在通讯工作上的主要经验是：虽然我国工农群众的文化水平不高，但工农通讯员还是可以发展，而且可以做出成绩来的。工农通讯员运动展开了，就会使我们的报纸有很大的改进，带来很大的生气。
    工人农民群众中的积极分子对担任报纸的通讯员是热情而引以为荣的。“旅大职工报”的工人通讯员中有一百多名积极分子，他们几乎天天下班后就轮流到报社去研究写稿和闲谈；像报社的特约记者似的，常驻在那一个工厂里写稿。报社每月把报道提纲发给他们，他们总是完成并超过计划的。几个月以前，报社提拔了一名工人任见习记者，工作态度和工作成绩都很好。“长春新报”的统计说明，在他们的全部通讯员中，工人通讯员约占百分之五十，而工人通讯员中起作用的在百分之五十以上，非工人通讯员起作用的却只有三分之一。尽管文化水平比较低，但是由于实际工作中的具体感受，工农通讯员也能写出有重要意义的稿子来。“新湖南报”收到了一些工农通讯员的来稿，其中有些确提出了当时工作中的重要问题。例如新谷登场以后，农民来稿曾提出谷贱伤农问题；在整顿农民协会中，农民来稿中又曾提出中农占据农协的主要领导成份的偏向。这些来搞使“新湖南报”的干部对发展工农通讯员的重要意义，有了进一步的认识。所有这些情形，都证明工农通讯员的作用确是极巨大的，展开工农通讯员运动确是改进报纸工作的最重要的方向和方法，而半年余以来，我们的报纸在吸引广大工农积极分子参加报纸工作上也确实已经做出了一些成绩。
    但是，从全国范围来说，工农通讯员运动的展开还是不平衡的。在已有的成就中也反映出许多问题还没有很好的加以解决。对于发展工农通讯员运动，我们在思想上有一些主要点还不很明确；在通讯网的组织和领导上，在通讯员的使用上，还有一些缺点和困难；解决这些问题，将成为进一步开展工农通讯员运动的重要关键。
    工农通讯员的政治意义主要的究竟在什么地方呢？斯大林同志教导我们：“只有工农通讯员才能实现这个伟大的转变”，即“使得像报纸这样尖锐的阶级斗争武器能够从奴役人民的武器变为解放人民的武器”。这样高度的原则性的提法究竟根据什么呢？对于这一点有许多人的体会是不深刻的。我们的报纸工作人员在讨论发展工农通讯员的意义时，常把主要着眼点放在工农通讯员对新闻报道的作用上，争辩的主要锋芒常集中在批判那种认为工农通讯员不能作“全面的、有指导意义的”报道，因而不愿意或不能耐心地发展工农通讯员的错误的认识上。这一点原是很重要的，既然我们的报纸的主要缺点之一是缺少生动活泼的反映劳动人民生活和生产的实际状况的新闻通讯，为了改进我们的新闻报道，使社会上的新的、先进的事物能迅速反映到报纸上来，工农通讯员就确能成为一剂对症的良药。但工农通讯员的主要政治意义却不只是这一点。
    工农通讯员的最重要的政治意义首先在于它起着劳动人民舆论的代表者和传达者的作用，是报纸展开批评和自我批评的群众队伍和主力军，是实行舆论上的群众监督的唯一可靠的依据。没有人能够否认，我们的报纸基本上都是人民的报纸，是与一切旧的报纸在本质上完全不同的。在现社会中不能容许和不可能有作为“奴役人民的武器”的报纸存在。但是这只是伟大的转变的发端。报纸要成为真正“解放人民的武器”，仅有报纸工作人员及其领导机关的意愿和努力是十分不够的，问题的关键是必须使报纸具体地掌握在劳动人民自己的手里，使报纸能真正充满了人民的声音、人民的要求、人民的舆论。而工农通讯员就是实现这种要求的最基本的不可代替的方式。工农通讯员在人民群众与报纸之间建立起了具体的经常的联系，把人民的舆论传达到报纸上来，成为各种实际工作中的缺点和错误的不妥协的揭发者，使报纸能成为反对一切旧的、落后的、蜕化的、阻碍社会前进的思想、意识、行为的战斗的武器。没有广大的工农积极分子担任通讯员，就不啻切断了报纸与群众间的直接而具体的联系，就不能保证自己真正成为人民自己的报纸，就不能保证使自己的眼睛不为官僚主义、命令主义等的迷雾所蒙蔽。
    工农通讯员的主要的政治意义就是如此。如果工农通讯员不起劳动人民舆论的代表者和传达者的作用，就不能成为斯大林所说的那种“重大的政治力量”。
    在各地报纸已经组织起来了的工农通讯员中，有一些积极分子已勇敢地担负起“社会缺点的揭发者”的任务。报纸上来自工农通讯员中的批评稿件，成了报纸在展开批评和自我批评上的重要部分，在这一点上已有了一些生动的例子。但工农通讯员在这一方面所发挥的作用还是不大的，还不是多数通讯员都能认识自己在这一方面的作用。产生这种现象的主要原因，就在于许多报纸工作者对于工农通讯员的政治意义的认识有片面性。而工农通讯员之成为报纸联系群众、联系实际的主要纽带，正在于他是群众舆论的代表者和传达者，生动活泼的新鲜事物的报道者，和群众思想情况的反映者。
    从这里应该得出的结论是什么呢？结论就应该是：在发展工农通讯员时应该首先加以重视的条件不是他们的文化水平和写作能力，而是那种对人民事业所表现的由衷的关切，对新鲜事物的敏感和真诚的爱护，尤其是对缺点及错误的不妥协精神。在培养和教育工农通讯员的工作中，首先应当注重的也不是新闻采写技术的训练（虽然这也是必要的），而是前述的那种政治品质的启发和锻炼。关于工农通讯员的稿件是否片面而琐碎的这一类争辩，当然也应该加以解决，但仅解决这些问题并不能把工农通讯员运动引导到正确的方向去。
    通讯员发展起来了之后，对于他们的组织和领导也还存在着一些问题。
    通讯员是一种有组织的力量，只有形成遍布各地的通讯员网，才能最大限度地发挥通讯员的力量，使报纸真正联系实际，联系群众。但是，群众中的积极分子担任报社的通讯员又应该是完全自觉的，通讯员网既不应依托于某种其他组织，通讯员也并不与报社有固定的组织关系，似乎既然担任了通讯员便必须受某种组织上的约束。因此，报纸在发展通讯员中就不可能依靠其他的力量，而只能依靠编辑部自己的组织完善的群众工作，首先是个别的面谈和通讯联系。每一个报纸工作人员，每一个派驻各地的记者，首要的责任就是做这种群众工作。
    然而，我们有些报纸还不懂得在加强群众工作上作最大限度的努力，是报纸组织工农通讯员的唯一的也是最有效的方法。依靠某种组织发展通讯员常成为主要的方式，有的报纸在发展通讯员时甚至采取了行政命令的方式，根本没有得到对方的同意，就确定他是通讯员，许多有名无实不起作用的通讯员常就是因此而产生的。须要用极大的毅力改变这种工作方式。其次，在通讯员网的领导上，随着编辑部实行编、采、通合一的组织形式和工作方法出现了一些新的问题，造成了一种“分散经营”、领导涣散的现象，其结果是使编辑部不能好好进行群众工作。这种现象必须加以纠正。实行编、采、通合一的目的，原在于克服由于这三种工作互相割裂所造成的妨碍联系实际的现象，但是，除了一部分有专业分工的通讯员之外，大部分一般的通讯员并不常知道编辑部各组怎样分工，那一种稿件应交那一组处理，如果没有适当的部门来负责这一方面的工作，通讯员就将有无所适从之感。现在有些报纸已实行与编辑部各组平行，设立一个地方通讯组（或读者来信组），专事领导地方通讯员的办法，来克服前述的缺点。在各报的记者网未建立的情形下，这种办法是比较可行的。
    范围广大的通讯员网的领导必须依靠编辑部工作人员全体的努力。在这一方面记者有特别重大的责任，采访某一部门的记者应该负责领导某一部门的通讯员，派驻某一地区的特派记者也就应该负责领导某一地区的通讯网。苏联的报纸在这一方面有极明确的规定。联共中央在决议中写道：“……在报纸周围组织广大的编辑部以外的作者积极分子，吸收党、苏维埃及经济组织的工作人员，苏维埃知识分子、工人与农村通讯员参加报纸的工作是地方特派记者的首要任务。”必须如此，才能摆脱通讯员网对某些机关的依赖，使它成为代表人民舆论的独立的力量。
    但实现这样的领导方法需要把我们的采访和通讯工作的方法作一个极大的转变。我们在通讯工作上的重要问题之一是在对于通讯员力量的使用，对于通讯工作在报纸编辑工作中所占的地位、与采访工作的关系上。存在着很大的缺点，许多报纸工作人员争论着“到底是记者第一，还是通讯员第一”，有的记者不仅不帮助和发展通讯员，而且把通讯员看成只是提供新闻线索的人，通讯员写来了新闻线索，记者抢着写，或者重要的新闻自己写了，只留下次要的给通讯员写。而报社的通联工作人员却因此产生了不应有的自卑感，说什么“一记者、二编辑、三通联”，似乎通联工作是一种很不重要的工作。这种现象是相当普遍的，它大大地限制了通讯员的积极性，成为发展工农通讯员的严重的障碍，必须坚决加以纠正。
    通讯员与记者的工作是有所不同的。记者是专业的新闻工作者，应该有很高的专业技能，同时又有很广的接触面，因此，在执行报道任务上应该对自己有更高的要求。劫夺通讯员的新闻线索，或争写通讯员可以写的新闻通讯，是记者没有做好自己的工作的表现，是记者的失职，这是一方面。更重要的是记者不仅是一个单纯的采访人员，而且应该主要是一个组织工作者，他的主要工作应该是组织通讯员进行报道。记者无论如何是数量很少的，他不可能代替通讯员进行一切较重要的报道，因此，组织良好和广泛的通讯员网应该成为报纸报道工作的主力军，而记者在报道上只是这支主力军中的精锐和突击力量。这要求报纸编辑部的领导者和工作人员思想上有一个大的转变，树立起依靠通讯员、走群众路线的思想，把使用通讯员的力量放在首要的地位，而品评记者的工作时首先是看他在执行组织任务上的成就，而不是看他写了多少篇新闻通讯。没有这种转变，就不能发扬通讯员的积极性，这在现在已成为开展通讯工作的主要的障碍之一了。
    实行了这种转变之后，报纸通讯网的构成就会出现一个新的面貌，使通讯员脱离对其他机关的依靠，变成集中领导于编辑部的独立的力量，经由报纸编辑部的组织完善的群众工作来巩固这种联系和领导。如此，逐步把原来由各地方机关领导的通讯站（组）移交给报纸的地方特派记者去组织和联系，报纸的记者网也就是通讯员网，这样不仅对加强通讯报道有很大的好处，对于发扬工农通讯员的战斗作用，展开群众性的批评和自我批评，也将会促成很大的进步。
    总之，明确认识工农通讯员的主要政治意义，正确地使用通讯员的力量，改善通讯员网的组织和领导，这就是在已有的基础上，改善和进一步展开通讯工作的几个主要问题。为迎接一九五一年报纸工作的更大的改进，特提出以上的意见，供各地报纸工作者参考。
