　　Reader's Letters
　　Editor's Note: The coal for Beijing used to be supplied by the Mentougou Coal Mine, but due to heavy rains last July and August, part of the mine was flooded, and production decreased. Therefore, coal was transported from other places to Beijing for adjustment. In order to ensure the price and quality of coal in Beijing, the Beijing Coal Construction Company signed distribution contracts with 1,493 private coal shops in the city. Most coal shops were able to comply with these contracts. However, a few illegal coal merchants sold coal at high prices or lowered the quality of coal. For example, Tianyi Hou Coal Shop in Wuyiku, Xicheng, Hengdeyu Coal Shop inside Guang'anmen, and Deshengyong Coal Shop in Shuaizishi, Nancheng, etc., have been punished for violating the contract. In order to ensure the enforcement of the contract, citizens can report the situation to the Beijing Coal Construction Company for investigation and handling at any time.
　　What is the cause of accidents in four factories in Datong and other places?
　　Zhang Yi
　　Last year, the state-owned Datong Flour Company, Pingwang Power Plant, Zhangjiakou Electrical Machinery Factory, and Oil Extraction Factory, etc., successively experienced machine accidents of varying degrees, causing significant losses to state property.
　　Technical guidance occupies a very important position in industrial production. Some economic workers do not understand this point and blindly trust narrow "old experiences," causing serious losses to production. The Datong Flour Company is a typical example. The administrative负责人 [fù zé rén, person in charge] of the factory believed that technical personnel could not "unite" well with the workers. Therefore, they did not hire technical personnel. From the day the factory was repaired, they relied on a few workers to restore it to its "original state." Many projects did not meet specifications, which planted the seeds for subsequent accidents. In September, a new axle worth more than 11 million yuan was installed. As a result, the axle seat was not up to standard, and the baseline was not correct. A brand-new axle broke in the middle on November 29th after less than three months of operation. In the factory's nine months of production last year, downtime due to machine accidents accounted for 17.205% of the total production time. This is a shockingly serious accident. The production task was not completed, and the products greatly exceeded the cost standards. In addition, the cost of damaged machines, etc., resulted in a loss of more than 125 million yuan—more than 41% of the total investment amount. If it were not for the loan support from the People's Bank, Datong's only mechanized flour mill would have gone bankrupt.
　　The leading cadres of the Zhangjiakou Electrical Machinery Factory do not understand that in production competitions, special attention should be paid to inspiring employees to use their brains, improve production technology, work methods, and labor organization to infinitely improve labor productivity. They mistakenly regarded the production competition as a short-term "rush," violated scientific technical operating procedures, and caused machine damage accidents. On November 26th, during overtime work in the fitter section, workers Chen Yushan and others found a problem with the factory's only pressure machine when making chain plates for electrical parts. Without rushing to repair it, they reluctantly started it in order to "catch up with work," until it lost pressure efficiency. After stopping the machine, an inspection revealed that the body of the pressure machine was cracked. The machine had to be shut down for more than two months to be repaired. The impact of reduced production and losses are not yet calculated, but the repair costs alone will be more than 2 million yuan. The section chief of the fitter shop insisted that "the only reason for the accident is that the machine is old." But on the spot, an honest worker said, "If it were carefully operated, it wouldn't have had an accident even after decades of use." On December 6th, in order to "increase" the oil yield, Zhao Yuxiang's team at the Oil Extraction Factory increased the machine efficiency to more than 113% of the quota efficiency, continuously damaging five lead screws and bending two square bars on the brand-new No. 6 and No. 7 oil presses, which had been in operation for only nine months. The machines were shut down for 23 hours, reducing oil production by more than 7,000 catties.
　　In winter, machine security is very important. It is especially important to seriously implement winter protection instructions and conduct regular and careful inspections. However, some factory leaders have neglected this point, causing accidents such as freezing and cracking of machines. For example, after the No. 3 boiler of the Pingwang Power Plant was shut down for five days, the engineer instructed Zhang Tiansuo, the boiler section chief, to drain the water. After draining the water, no one thoroughly inspected it. On November 24th of last year, when the furnace was being overhauled, the wind shield of the induced draft fan bearing was removed and not installed for several days, allowing cold air to enter the economizer through the duct. At 7:30 a.m. on November 27th, an explosion was heard behind the boiler. An inspection revealed that 131 elbows in the economizer were frozen and cracked due to standing water, resulting in a loss of more than 16 million yuan. Several days before the accident, a frozen axle tile had occurred, but it still did not remind the factory leaders of their consistent paralysis of thought, thinking: "Freezing an axle tile is nothing, welding it on is enough!" Therefore, this major accident was caused.
　　The above-mentioned machine accidents give us a profound lesson: the main root cause of the accidents is that various types of bureaucratism exist to varying degrees in the leadership of each factory. We should firmly remember what Comrade Stalin taught us: "It requires our economic managers not to lead enterprises 'generally', not to lead enterprises 'from the air', but to lead enterprises concretely and practically; it requires them not to treat every problem with a strict and realistic attitude based on general empty talk, but to master the technology of work, be familiar with the details of work, and be familiar with 'small things', because now big things are made up of 'small things'." (Speech at the Soviet Economic Workers Conference on June 23, 1931)
　　An old farmer in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, donates revolutionary relics preserved for eighteen years.
　　Editor Comrades:
　　I will tell you a story about an old farmer in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, who donated revolutionary relics that he had preserved for eighteen years.
　　Li Yingyuan is a farmer in Fanshangwu, Wuxi Village, Taolin Township, Fourth District, Linxiang County. He is seventy-two years old this year. He was overjoyed when the township implemented land reform this time. When the land reform work team comrades went to his home, he was as happy as seeing relatives and could not speak. Finally, he said, "Chairman Mao's troops are here! We have been waiting for more than ten years. In the past, Chairman Mao led us to establish peasant associations, fight local tyrants, and distribute land. Later, the Red Army went to northern Shaanxi, and the Kuomintang came here. We waited every day for Chairman Mao's Red Army to return. When General Wang Zhen fought the Japanese devils here, we were all overjoyed. Soon, the troops left again, and the Kuomintang army came again, and our people suffered again. Today, you are here again..."
　　After he finished speaking, he went to the back of the house and took out a dust-covered cloth bag from the wall. He patted the dust, untied the cloth bag, and took out a circular seal, saying, "I will dedicate this good treasure to the government. I have hidden this treasure for eighteen years." The comrades of the work team took it and looked carefully. It turned out to be the seal of the "Linxiang County First District Second Township Peasant Association."
　　Li Yingyuan said: In 1927, his father, Li Fengxiang, and Li Xiaogui (died eight years ago), Li Dongru (seventy-six years old this year), and others, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, founded the Peasant Association in their township. At that time, the masses elected Li Xiaogui as the chairman, Li Dongru as the vice chairman, and his father Li Fengxiang as the secretary to lead the peasants to turn themselves over. After the Red Army left, the Peasant Association was disbanded by the Kuomintang and the local tyrant's defense bureau. Li Fengxiang believed that the Red Army would definitely return, so he secretly hid the seal of the Peasant Association. In 1932, Li Fengxiang died of illness. Before he died, he handed the seal of the Peasant Association to his son Li Yingyuan, and said, "I will give you a good thing. This is the seal of our Peasant Association. You must keep it well. When Chairman Mao and the Communist Red Army return, we will run the Peasant Association again, and when we fight local tyrants and distribute land again, you will hand over this seal."
　　Li Yingyuan kept his father's words firmly in his heart and kept the seal well in the wall. He waited today and hoped tomorrow, waiting for eighteen years. The Communist Party led the peasants to carry out land reform here. Li Yingyuan happily followed his father's will and dedicated the revolutionary seal to the township government.

　　Yuan Xianbao becomes a cooperative model.
　　Editor Comrades:
　　Comrade Yuan Xianbao, director of the Loufanji Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jingle County, was born as a coal worker. After joining the work in 1941, he has consistently worked hard and cared about the suffering of the masses. After being transferred to work in the cooperative, he personally took goods to the countryside and went deep into the masses to organize cooperatives. In July last year, he took goods to the Kuanhegou Coal Mine, 25 miles away from Loufan Town, to develop members. He first went through the factory and the trade union to publicize during the workers' rest time to improve the masses' understanding of the cooperative. At that time, 63 workers immediately requested to buy shares. However, because some of the workers' coal could not be sold, Lao Yuan led the cooperative to immediately find ways to find a market for the coal and introduced it to government agencies. He also mobilized Fanjiacun Village to organize cooperative members to burn lime. Three kilns shared more than 20,000 catties of coal from the Kuanhegou Coal Mine. In the transportation of coal, he also organized 25 livestock, which also increased the income of the members. He also actively encouraged the masses to build dams and weirs to prevent rainwater from flooding the fields. All these measures made the masses feel that the cooperative was truly seeking benefits for the people. Through the combination of cooperative business and production to organize cooperatives, he developed 500 members in just 50 days.
　　Because Lao Yuan was able to approach the masses, enthusiastically find solutions for them, and serve them with infinite loyalty, he was supported and trusted by the members.
　　Comrade Yuan was transferred to the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative to participate in the rectification study and was rated as a cooperative model.

　　Shunyi County Government should return the borrowed grain.
　　Editor Comrades:
　　There is a problem in our village that has not been resolved yet. The problem is as follows:
　　In the winter of 1948, when our People's Liberation Army surrounded Beijing, many troops were stationed in our village. The food for the troops was temporarily borrowed from the villages where the troops were stationed, with the understanding that it would be returned later. After receiving this instruction, we borrowed more than 20,000 catties according to the share. At that time, our village belonged to Changshun County, and now it has been划归 [huá guī, assigned to the jurisdiction of] Shunyi County. During the handover procedures, Comrade Wang Zhetian, the financial and grain assistant in our district, underreported more than 11,000 catties, so when the government returned the borrowed grain after the wheat harvest this year, it only returned more than 9,000 catties to our village. When we realized the mistake, we went to the county government with Comrade Wang Zhetian to declare it, and as a result, the more than 11,000 catties of grain were calculated. The Shunyi County Government replied: "Go back first, and we will be responsible for asking for instructions and returning it to you." But we have not heard any news yet. We hope that the Shunyi County Government can quickly resolve this issue.

　　The quality of coal briquettes in Beijing is too bad.
　　Editor Comrades:
　　My family lives near Xizhimen. I often hear my family members and neighbors complain that the coal briquettes they buy burn out as soon as they are lit. Often the rice is not cooked, and the fire goes out. I don't know if it is the coal shops adding too much soil to make more money, or if the quality of coal is particularly bad this year? I hope this matter will be reported to the Coal Industry Company for investigation.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wang Yongwen, Beijing Transportation Company
　　Editor Comrades:
　　After the People's Daily published the news of "Death from Coal Gas Poisoning," the people in all districts of the city are carefully taking precautions. I think that when the weather is cold, everyone likes to keep warm by the fire. Most of the victims are working people because they mostly use stoves without chimneys, cooking and warming themselves at the same time. Under such circumstances, I have found some problems with this year's fuel coal. How can a small family afford tons of high-quality coal? They can only buy a little and burn a little at nearby coal shops or retail stores. After the coal briquettes bought are lit, the room is full of smoke, which directly makes people dizzy. Some people have reported that this year's coal is adulterated. I hope the government will investigate the reason. If those coal shops and a few retail stores that are greedy for high profits and disregard the health of the people do add other impurities, they should be punished.

    编者按：京市燃煤原系门头沟煤矿供应，但因去年七、八月大雨，该矿部分被淹，产量减低，乃由他处运煤来京调剂。为保证京市煤价及煤质，北京市煤建公司与本市一千四百九十三家私营煤铺订立了经销合同，大部煤铺均能遵守这合同。但有少数不法煤商却高价售煤，或降低煤质。如西城武衣库天义厚煤铺、广安门内恒德玉煤铺及南城刷子市德盛永煤铺等，因违犯合同已受到处分。为了保证合同的执行，市民可将情况随时反映给京市煤建公司调查处理。
    大同等地四个工厂发生事故症结何在？
    张毅
    大同市国营面粉公司、平旺发电厂、张家口机电厂、榨油厂等，去年连续发生轻重不同的机器事故，使国家财产受到很大损失。
    工业生产中的技术指导，占有极重要的位置。有的经济工作者不了解这一点，盲目的轻信狭隘“老经验”，使生产受到严重损失。大同面粉公司就是其中的一个典型例子。该厂行政负责人认为：技术人员不能和工人“团结”好。因此，不聘请技术人员，从修复工厂那天起，就靠几个工人在恢复“原样”，许多工程都不合乎规格，种下了后来连续事故的病根。九月间，按装价值一千一百多万元的新大轴，结果，装起来轴座不合标准，基线不正，一根崭新的大轴运转不到三个月，于十一月二十九日从中裂断。该厂去年九个月生产中，因机器事故停车时间，占总生产时间的百分之十七点二零五。这是十分惊人的严重事故。生产任务没有完成，产品大大超过了成本标准，再加上损坏机器等费用，结果亏本一亿二千五百多万元，——占投资总金额的百分之四十一强。如果没有人民银行贷款扶植，就要把大同市仅此一家的机制面粉厂赔垮。
    张家口机电厂的领导干部，不了解生产竞赛中，要特别注意启发职工开动脑筋，改进生产技术、工作方法与劳动组织，才能无限提高劳动生产率；而错误的把生产竞赛当成短时期的“突击”，违犯了科学的技术操作规程，造成损坏机器事故。该厂钳工股在十一月二十六日加班中，工人陈玉山等在使用该厂唯一的压力机做电溜子上的链子板时，发现有毛病不加抢修，为了“赶活”勉强开动，一直到失去压力效率为止，停车后检查出压力机大身被弄裂。该机要停车两个多月才能修好。影响减产损失暂不计算，仅修理费一项要二百余万元。钳工股长还硬说是：“事故的唯一原因，就是机器老了。”但当场就有正直的工人说：“要是精心操作，用它几十年也不会出事故。”十二月六日，榨油厂赵玉祥班为了“提高”出油率，把机器效能提高到定额效能的百分之一百十三强，把总共运转九个月时间的崭新六、七号榨油机，连续损坏五根丝杠，压弯两根方杠。停车二十三台时，减产油七千多斤。
    冬季里，机器保安非常重要。认真执行冬防指示和经常、细心的检查，其意义特别重大。但有的工厂领导同志恰恰忽视这点，造成冻裂机器等事故。例如平旺电厂的三号锅停火五天后，工程师指示锅炉股长张天锁放水，放水后谁也没彻底检查。去年十一月二十四日检修该炉时，把吸风机轴承挡风板拆下，一直几天没装上，使冷风从风道进入省煤器里面。十一月二十七日早七点半，听见锅炉后面有爆炸声，经检查才知道省煤器里因有存水，冻裂一百三十一根弯头，损失达一千六百多万元。发生该事故前数日，曾发生冻裂轴瓦，仍没提醒该厂领导上的一贯麻痹思想，认为：“冻裂轴瓦不算啥，用电焊焊上能用就算了！”因此，造成这次较大的事故。
    从以上几件机器事故中，给我们一个深刻的教训，那就是：由于各厂领导上或多或少地存在各种类型的官僚主义，是造成事故的主要根源。应该牢牢地记住斯大林同志教诲我们的话：“就要我们经济工作领导者不是‘一般地’领导企业，不是‘从空中’领导企业，而是具体切实地领导企业；就要他们不是根据一般空谈，而是以严格求实态度来对待每一个问题；就要他们不限于纸上敷衍搪塞或一般辞藻和口号，而要精通工作技术，熟习工作详情，熟悉‘小事情’，因为现在大事情是由‘小事情’积成的。”（一九三一年六月二十三日在苏联经济工作人员会议上的演说）
    湖南临湘县一老农献出保存了十八年的革命遗物编辑同志：
    我告诉你们一个湖南临湘县老农民献出他保存了十八年的革命遗物的故事。
    李应元是临湘县第四区桃林乡武溪村畈上屋的农民，今年已经七十二岁了。这次乡里实行土地改革，他欢喜得了不得。土地改革工作队同志到他家里去，他就像看见亲人一样，乐得说不出话来。最后，他才说：“毛主席的队伍来了！我们已盼了十多年了。过去毛主席领导我们办农民协会，打土豪，分田地。后来红军上了陕北，国民党到了我们这里；我们每天盼着毛主席的红军回来。打日本鬼子的时候，王震将军打我们这里过，我们都欢喜得了不得。不久，队伍又开走了，国民党遭殃军又来了，我们老百姓又遭了殃。今天，你们可又来了………。”
    他说完话，就到屋后墙夹里，拿出一个布满灰尘的布包。他拍了拍灰尘，解开布包，拿出一个圆形的图章说：“我把这件好宝贝献给政府。这宝贝我已藏了十八年了。”工作队同志接过仔细一看，原来是“临湘县第一区第二乡农民协会”的图章。
    李应元说：在一九二七年的时候，他的父亲李凤祥和李晓贵（八年前死了）、李东如（今年七十六岁）等在毛主席的领导下在本乡创立了农民协会。当时群众选举了李晓贵为正会长，李东如为副会长，他父亲李凤祥为秘书，领导农民搞翻身。红军开走后，农民协会便被国民党、地主的团防局解散了。李凤祥相信红军一定会回来的，就把这个农民协会的图章偷偷地藏起来。一九三二年，李凤祥病死了。他临死前，把这个农民协会的图章交给他儿子李应元，并且说：“我交给你一个好东西。这是我们农民协会的图章，你要好好地保存着，等毛主席、共产党的红军回来，我们再办农民协会，再打土豪、分田地时，你把这个图章交上去。”
    李应元把他父亲的话牢牢地记在心里，并且把这个图章好好地保存在墙夹里。他今天盼，明天望，等了十八年，共产党领导农民在这里进行土地改革了，李应元就欢天喜地按着他父亲的遗嘱，把这个革命的图章献给了乡政府。

    袁宪保当了合作模范编辑同志：
    静乐县楼烦集镇供销社主任袁宪保同志，系煤工出身，一九四一年参加工作后，一贯埋头苦干关切群众疾苦。调到合作社工作后，他亲自带着货物下乡，深入群众组织合作社。去年七月份他带货到距楼烦镇二十五里的宽河沟煤厂发展社员。他首先通过了厂方和工会，利用群众休息时间进行宣传，提高群众对合作社的认识，当时马上就有六十三个工人要求入股。但当时因工人有部分煤炭售不出去，老袁领导合作社立即设法给煤炭找寻销路，介绍卖给政府机关。他又发动范家庄村组织合作社社员烧石灰。三个窑共用宽河沟煤厂的炭二万余斤。在运炭中又组织了二十五头牲口，也增加了社员的收入。烧出的石灰，他又积极鼓励群众建筑坝堰，防止雨水浸冲田苗。这一切的措施使群众感到合作社真正在为人民谋福利。通过合作社的业务结合生产，进行组织合作社，仅五十天时间，他就发展了五百个社员。
    由于老袁能接近群众，热心替他们想办法和无限忠心地为他们服务，因而得到了社员们的拥护和信任。
    袁同志此次调到专区供销社参加整风学习，被评为合作模范。

    顺义县政府应还清借粮编辑同志：
    我村有一个问题，到现在还没有解决。问题的经过是这样的：
    一九四八年的冬季，咱们的解放军包围北京时，我村驻有不少的军队，军队的食粮由各驻军村暂借，言明以后归还。我们得到这个指示后，就按分摊筹共借出二万多斤。当时我们这个村是属于昌顺县，现在已划归顺义县了。在交接手续时，被本区财粮助理员王哲田同志给少报了一万一千多斤，所以在今年麦秋后，政府退还借粮时，只退我村九千多斤。我们知道错了，便找王哲田同志到县府去声明，结果把这一万一千多斤粮算了出来。顺义县府答复是：“你们先回去吧，我们负责给你们请示后发还。”可是到现在我们还没有听到消息。我们希望顺义县政府能迅速解决这个问题。

    北京市上煤球质量太坏编辑同志：
    我家住在西直门附近。经常听到我家里的人和邻居们反映：他们买的煤球一着火就完了。时常饭未煮熟，火就熄了。这不知道是煤铺要多赚钱掺了太多的土，还是今年的煤质特别坏？望将这件事情反映给煤业公司调查一下。
                                   北京搬运公司  王用文编辑同志：
    人民日报日前刊登“煤气熏死人”的消息后，本市各区人民正在小心防范。我想天气冷，谁都喜欢凭火取暖。被难者多是劳动人民，因为他们多使用没有烟囱的炉子，一面做饭，一面取暖，在这样的情况下，我发现今年的燃煤有些问题。本来一个小家庭，那能买起成吨的高元煤？只能在附近的煤铺或零售店里去买一点烧一点。买来的煤球火着之后，满室乌烟瘴气，直熏的人头昏眼花。有人反映：今年的煤掺了假。希望政府调查一下这个原因。假使那些贪图高利不顾人民健康的煤铺和少数零售店，确实掺了其他杂质，则应予以处罚。
