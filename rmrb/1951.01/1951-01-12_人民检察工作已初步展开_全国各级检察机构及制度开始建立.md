　　People's Procuratorial Work Has Begun to Unfold
    National Procuratorial Organs and Systems at All Levels Across the Country Have Begun to Be Established
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In the past year, people's procuratorial work has achieved certain results. Five procuratorial branches have been established in the five major administrative regions of the country, and thirty-five provincial, seventeen municipal, eleven special district, and forty-one county procuratorates have been established. The Supreme People's Procuratorate alone handled 749 cases in the second half of last year. The establishment of the above-mentioned organs and the initial development of people's procuratorial work have laid a good foundation for continuing to carry out procuratorial work in the future.
    People's procuratorial work is one of the new systems of New China. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government has been working in accordance with Article 28 of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government, which stipulates that "the Supreme People's Procuratorate shall be ultimately responsible for supervising government organs, public servants, and all citizens of the country in strictly observing the law."
    In the first half of last year, the main work was to establish central and local procuratorial organs and draft various rules and regulations, with little actual procuratorial work being carried out. In the second half of the year, especially after the Government Administration Council and the Supreme People's Court jointly issued the "Directive on Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Activities," procuratorial organs at all levels focused on prosecuting counter-revolutionary cases, working with judicial and public security organs to investigate and handle counter-revolutionary and other special criminal cases, and inspecting and correcting some improperly sentenced cases and inadequate prison management.
    Among the more than 700 cases handled by the Supreme People's Procuratorate in the second half of last year, in addition to those specially reviewed by the Supreme People's Court, the cases directly appealed by the masses and transferred by other organs mainly involved accusations against public security, judicial, and other government officials for violating laws and regulations, improper sentencing, improper sentencing of counter-revolutionaries, and administrative litigation. These cases have generally been well received due to the Supreme People's Procuratorate's prompt, prudent, and strict handling.
    The more significant achievements of procuratorial organs at all levels over the past year have been, after the Government Administration Council and the Supreme People's Court jointly issued the "Directive on Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Activities," basically correcting the tendency of "unlimited leniency" in conjunction with judicial and public security organs; and some achievements have also been made in exposing counter-revolutionary cases and cases of public servants violating laws and regulations.
    Regarding the prosecution of counter-revolutionary cases, according to incomplete statistics from the six northeastern provinces in the past six months, in addition to promoting, supervising, and assisting public security and judicial departments in clearing special criminal cases, a total of 1,390 counter-revolutionary cases were prosecuted. The handling of the above-mentioned criminals adopted the method of forming a three-person team composed of procuratorial, public security, and judicial personnel to jointly study and discuss, and then submit it to a four-person committee (procuratorial, government, public security, court) for review (this method is now mostly used in other provinces). Therefore, the cases exposed by procuratorial organs at all levels are relatively accurate. The Shenyang Municipal Procuratorate exposed the case of the city's People's Court only sentencing Yu Tianlong, a traitor, Kuomintang secret agent, and war criminal, to only two years in prison, and later the sentence was revised, as well as other counter-revolutionary cases it exposed, which were all supported by the broad masses of the people. Citizens discussed one after another, saying, "The Communist Party's policy is still correct, those who should not be lenient should not be lenient." "The People's Government is not lenient to bad people." The Liaoxi Provincial Procuratorate found that the province's People's Court only sentenced Wang Jingyao, the head of an armed bandit special detachment, to three years in prison; the Jilin Provincial Procuratorate found that the province's People's Court only sentenced Zhang Fuzeng, a traitorous war criminal and Kuomintang agent who had served as the commander of the Japanese puppet Shandong Security Command, deputy commander of the Military Statistics Bureau Volunteer Corps, and pacification director, to imprisonment; the Liaodong Provincial Procuratorate found that the province's People's Court proposed educating and releasing the director of the Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau's communications station, etc. After inspection, all the above cases have been corrected. In particular, the Liaoxi Provincial Procuratorate, due to inspecting more than 100 counter-revolutionary cases in the province's court that were improperly sentenced, discovered serious situations such as impure composition of the criminal court personnel, which aroused the attention of relevant authorities and was given appropriate adjustments.
    Regarding the exposure of cases of violation of laws and regulations, the Wuhan Municipal Procuratorate, under the Central South Branch, exposed that the city's People's Court conducted "voluntary donations for parole" for prisoners, releasing a number of reactionaries. The Guangdong Procuratorate exposed several major corruption cases, including the more prominent case of Luo Jiabao, manager of the Sixth Processing Factory of the Provincial Grain Bureau, embezzling more than 70 million yuan (already executed), Qu Muhua, director of the Shuidong Office of the Forestry Company, embezzling more than 30 million yuan, and the major corruption case of Huang Qi et al. of the South China Transportation Company. The Shaanxi Provincial Procuratorate, under the Northwest Branch, exposed the case of Li Yufeng, of the Qishan County People's Court, embezzling bribes, violating his duties, and being negligent; the case of Chen Yuru, a clerk of the Fengfeng County People's Court, arbitrarily removing the materials of seven important criminals; and the case of a cadre in the Yongding District of Hu County wrongly killing a person. The Tianjin Municipal Procuratorate, under the North China Branch, exposed cases of military personnel violating laws and regulations by selling drugs and opium, which have all been properly resolved.
    Regarding the improvement of prison administration, the Northeast and Northwest Procuratorates played a considerable role, discovering loose and麻痹phenomena in prison management, especially the Northwest Branch, which investigated cases of prisoners plotting riots and instigating prisoners to rebel against prison riots.
    Although people's procuratorial work has achieved the above-mentioned results, because this is a new work, it is being carried out without a foundation or experience. Therefore, the procuratorial organs that have already been established are still not sound enough. The Supreme People's Procuratorate plans to improve them this year and establish procuratorates in special districts and counties. In order to improve the work ability of cadres and exchange work experience, the Supreme People's Procuratorate also plans to conduct rotational training of procuratorial work cadres this year and publish publications to guide procuratorial work.

### 人民检察工作已初步展开  全国各级检察机构及制度开始建立

　　人民检察工作已初步展开
    全国各级检察机构及制度开始建立
    【本报讯】去年一年，人民检察工作取得了一定成绩。在全国五大行政区内建立了五个检察分署，并建立了三十五个省、十七个市、十一个专区和四十一个县的检察署。仅最高人民检察署在去年下半年即处理案件达七百四十九件。上述机关的建立与人民检察工作的初步开展，已为今后继续开展检察工作奠定了良好基础。
    人民检察工作是新中国的新制度之一。中央人民政府最高人民检察署自中央人民政府成立以来，即根据中央人民政府组织法第二十八条的规定“最高人民检察署对政府机关、公务人员和全国国民之严格遵守法律，负最高的检察责任”进行工作。
    在去年上半年，主要工作是建立中央及各级检察机构，草拟各项规章，很少进行实际检察工作。下半年，尤其是政务院和最高人民法院联合发布“关于镇压反革命活动的指示”后，各级检察署即以检察反革命案件为工作重心，会同司法、公安机关，清理和处理反革命等特刑案件，检察并纠正了若干判刑不当及监所管理失当的问题。
    最高人民检察署在去年下半年处理的七百余起案件中，除最高人民法院特刑送核者外，在群众直接控诉及其他机关转来的案件中，主要是控告公安、司法及其他机关公务人员违法乱纪、判刑不当，对反革命分子量刑不当，以及行政诉讼等案件。这些案件由于最高人民检察署给予迅速、慎重而严正的处理，一般反应良好。
    各级检察署一年来比较显著的成就，是在政务院和最高人民法院联合发布“关于镇压反革命活动的指示”后，会同司法、公安等机关基本上纠正了“宽大无边”的偏向；在检举反革命案件和公务人员违法乱纪案件等方面，也都作出了一些成绩。
    关于检察反革命案件中，据东北六省半年来不完全的统计，除推动督促与帮助公安、司法部门清理特刑案件外，共检察了反革命案件一千三百九十起。对上述案犯的处理，采取了检察、公安、司法组成三人小组共同研究、讨论，再提交四人委员会（检察、政府、公安、法院）审核的办法（现其他各省也多采用这种办法）。故各级检察署检举的案件均较正确。沈阳市检察署检举该市人民法院对汉奸、国民党特务、战争罪犯于天龙只轻判两年徒刑的案件，后又得以重行改判，以及检举的其他反革命案件，都为广大人民所拥护。市民纷纷议论说：“共产党的政策还是对，不应该宽大的还是不宽大。”“人民政府对坏人并不宽大。”辽西省检察署检察出该省人民法院对武装匪特头子突击支队长王敬尧只判三年徒刑；吉林省检察署检察出该省人民法院对汉奸战犯国特张复曾历任日伪山东保安司令、军统义勇总队副总队长、绥靖主任，仅判徒刑；辽东省检察署检察出该省人民法院对匪中统通讯站主任等主张教育后释放，以上案件经检察后，均已得到纠正。特别是辽西省检察署由于检察该省法院百余起反革命案件判处不当，发现了刑庭人员成份不纯等严重情况，引起有关当局重视并予以适当调整。
    关于检举违法乱纪的案件中，如中南分署所属武汉市检察署检举出该市人民法院向犯人进行“乐捐假释”，释放了若干反动分子。广东检察署曾检举了数起大贪污案，其中较突出的有该省粮食局第六加工厂经理罗家宝贪污七千余万元（已枪决），林业公司水东办事处主任区慕化贪污三千余万元，华南运输公司黄起等巨大贪污案。西北分署所属陕西省检察署检举了岐山县人民法院李玉峰贪污受贿违法失职案、扶风县人民法院书记员陈裕如擅自卸掉七名要犯材料案和鄠县永定区干部错杀人命案。华北分署所属天津市检察署检举了部队人员违法乱纪贩卖毒品、白洋等案，都已得到适当解决。
    关于改进狱政工作方面，东北及西北检察分署都起了相当作用，他们发现了监所管理松懈麻痹现象，特别是西北分署曾检察出监犯密谋暴动案，策动监犯反监暴动案。
    人民检察工作虽已获得上述成绩，但因这是一项新的工作，它是在无基础无经验的情况下进行的，因此，现在已经建立起来的检察机构仍不够健全，最高人民检察署计划于本年内予以健全，并普遍建立专区和县的检察署。为了提高干部的工作能力，交流工作经验，最高人民检察署并拟于本年轮训检察工作干部，并出版指导检察工作的刊物。
