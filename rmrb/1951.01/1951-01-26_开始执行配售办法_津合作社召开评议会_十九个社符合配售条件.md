　　Implementation of Rationing Methods Begins
    Tianjin Cooperative Holds Review Meeting
    Nineteen Cooperatives Meet Rationing Requirements
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Tianjin Cooperative's first quarter rationing work began to be arranged in early January. Before the arrangement, cadres first studied and discussed the relevant rationing documents. According to the spirit of the documents, the district offices first made a preliminary review of the grassroots cooperatives under their jurisdiction, and then the municipal general cooperative's organization and training department reviewed the democratic system and business management policy of each cooperative. The finance and planning departments then reviewed the accounting statistical reports. Immediately afterwards, a joint meeting of directors of factory, agency, and school cooperatives in the city was held, and the four conditions for "rationing cooperative societies" determined by the rationing method were used to conduct the first preliminary evaluation, selecting forty-five societies with 147,000 members to enjoy the first month of rationing. After reconsideration, this was changed to nineteen societies with 93,000 members, and rationing was implemented on a trial basis.
    In this democratic evaluation, democracy was promoted, criticisms and self-criticisms were carried out, and mutual comparisons were made. For example, Zhao Huibin, director of the No. 2 Garment Factory Cooperative, was originally a production model worker in the factory and had won the first-class model worker medal three times. This time, because the cooperative did not receive rationing, he took off his medal and said, "Not getting rationing is not because the higher authorities did not give it, but because the work was not done well, especially the accounting and reporting work was not done well. I am determined to improve the work according to the conditions stipulated in the rationing method, get on the right track, and strive to enjoy the second quarter's rationing. I will put the medal back on then."
    On the other hand, some cooperative cadres who did not receive rationing did not start by examining their own work, but complained that the higher authorities did not lead, the administration did not support them, and the trade union did not help them, and even said that the cooperative members were "backward." Some cooperative cadres took sick leave because they were afraid of being blamed by the members for not getting rationing. Some even dared not announce to the members that their cooperative had not received rationing. The failure to implement rationing for the street cooperative's citizen members and the failure to promptly publicize and explain the situation also caused dissatisfaction among some cadres. In addition, because very few of the cooperatives that had been reorganized enjoyed rationing, some cadres had the mistaken idea that "reorganizing the cooperative is worse than not reorganizing it." At the same time, the review was not rigorous and responsible enough, and there were even phenomena of lowering the conditions and taking care of the emotions of the cadres.
    According to the above situation, the Tianjin Municipal General Cooperative conducted a second evaluation and review based on the principle of "rather have less but better." As a result, nineteen grassroots cooperatives (with 93,000 members) basically met the rationing conditions and enjoyed the first month's rationing. In order to do a good job in the rationing business, these cooperatives decided to conduct cooperative rectification in conjunction with rationing. Through the rationing business, member meetings or representative meetings at all levels of the cooperative, as well as meetings of the board of directors and supervisors of each level of cooperative, were convened to convey the rationing method. It was unanimously agreed that to enjoy rationing, the work of the cooperative must be improved. The Municipal General Cooperative determined the direction of future efforts for all grassroots cooperatives: the cooperatives that have received rationing should guard against arrogance, continue to improve their work, and strive to enjoy rationing for a long time. Cooperatives that have not received rationing should actively do their work well. The first priority is for cooperative cadres to conduct a review to the members, put forward a plan to improve the work, call on the members to put forward their opinions, and work together to strive to enjoy the second quarter's rationing. Although citizen members of street cooperatives will not be given a trial of rationing for the time being, they will still enjoy the general preferential treatment of cooperatives. As long as the business is done well and brought into line, the higher-level cooperatives will gradually take care of them.

　　开始执行配售办法
    津合作社召开评议会
    十九个社符合配售条件
    【本报讯】天津市合作社第一季度的配售业务，于一月初开始布置。在布置以前，干部首先对有关配售文件作了学习和讨论。根据文件精神，先由区办事处对所属基层社作初步审查，复经市总社组训处审查各社的民主制度和业务经营方针，又由财务、计划处对会计统计表报加以检讨。随即召开全市工厂、机关、学校社主任联席会议，根据配售办法决定的“享受配售合作社”的四个条件，进行第一次初步评议，选定了四十五个社、十四万七千社员享受第一个月的配售。后经复议为十九个社，九万三千社员，试行配售。
    在这次民主评议中，发扬了民主、进行了批评与自我批评，并进行了相互比较。如被服二厂社主任赵惠斌原是该厂生产模范，曾得三次一等模范奖章，这次因该社没有得到配售，当时摘去了自己的奖章说：“没有得到配售不是上级不给，而是工作没搞好，特别是会计表报工作未作好，今后决心按照配售办法上规定的条件，改进工作，走上正轨，争取享受第二季的配售，到那时再戴上奖章。”
    另一方面，尚有少数未得到配售的合作社干部，不从检讨自己工作下手，而抱怨上级不领导、行政不支持、工会不帮助，甚至说社员群众“落后”。也有的社干部因没有得到配售，惧怕社员责难而告病假。有的甚至不敢向社员宣布自己社没有得到配售的消息。街道合作社市民社员不实行配售，未及时进行宣传解释，也曾引起部分干部的不满。此外，又因已经整顿的合作社，享受配售的很少，于是有些干部有“整社反不如不整”的错误认识。同时，在评议时，认真地根据配售办法规定的条件，进行严格而又负责的审查，作的还不够，甚至有降低条件，照顾干部情绪的现象。
    津市总社根据以上情况，在“宁要少些但要好些”的原则下，又进行了第二次的评议与审查，结果有十九个基层社（社员九万三千人）大体符合配售条件，而享得第一月度配售。这些社为作好配售业务，决定结合配售进行整社。通过配售业务，分别召开社员大会或代表大会以及各级社的理监事会，传达配售办法，一致认为要享受配售，必须把合作社工作提高一步。市总社对全部基层社并分别确定今后努力方向：已得到配售的合作社，应力戒骄傲，继续改进工作，为争取长期享受配售而努力。没有得到配售的合作社，更应积极把工作作好。首要是社干部向社员进行检讨，提出改进工作的计划，号召社员提出意见，同心协力争取第二季享受配售。街道社市民社员虽暂不试行配售，但照常享受合作社一般优待，只要搞好业务，纳入正规，上级社是会逐步加以照顾的。
