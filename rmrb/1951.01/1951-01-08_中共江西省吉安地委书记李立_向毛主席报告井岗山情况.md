Comrade Mao Zedong:

The Jinggang Mountain慰問团(Comfort Group) organized by the Party, government, military, and civilians of the Ji'an Sub-district of Jiangxi Province, representing people from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province, arrived in Ciping, Jinggang Mountain, and the area around Da Xiaowujing on November 19, 1950; then traveled to Xiaojiang in Ninggang to extend their condolences to the people of the old Soviet area who had suffered from the persecution of the Kuomintang reactionary bandit gangs, and distributed 50,000 catties of grain. They returned to Ji'an on December 3rd. The report on the situation in Jinggang Mountain before and after liberation is as follows:

Since the Red Army left, Jinggang Mountain has become a desolate wilderness under the constant devastation and slaughter by Chiang bandits and local bullies such as Xiao Jia-bi and Yin Hao-men. The population has plummeted. Da Xiaowujing originally had 127 households, now only 59 remain. The original population was 582, now only 279 remain. Jinzhu Mountain originally had 11 residents, now only three lonely men in their sixties remain. Most of these people were killed by the notorious butcher Xiao Jia-bi. Before liberation, one-third of the farmland was abandoned. The original output was 2,128 piculs, now only 1,654 piculs remain, and the yield has also greatly decreased. All the houses were burned down, not even a thatched hut was left. The situations in Xiazhuang, Liujiaping, Ciping, Baini Lake, and other places were no exception. According to the survey, a total of 291 houses were burned down, totaling 2,358 rooms.

Politically, Suichuan, from Zhushao'ao upwards, and Yongxin, from Baini Lake upwards, all the way to Da Xiaowujing and Bamianshan, were designated as "bandit areas." Reactionary troops were stationed there for a long time, forbidding the common people from entering or leaving, attempting to starve the local people to death in the mountain valleys. Especially when liberation was near, the local bully Xiao Jia-bi妄想(vainly attempted) to rely on Jinggang Mountain as a foothold for continuing to oppose the people, using terrorist methods to force the masses to join the bandit ranks.

Economically, due to the sharp reduction in labor, a large amount of farmland and mountain areas were abandoned. In addition to the enemy's exploitation of the peasants through various means, and due to the scarcity of people, wild animals proliferated. Wild boars roamed in groups, and mountain cattle that had never been seen before also appeared. These continuous bandit disasters and natural calamities caused a serious disaster of successive years of poor harvests. The annual harvest was less than 40 percent, and in some places, not even the seeds could be recovered. The peasants' lives were extremely difficult.

However, the people of Jinggang Mountain, even the children, deeply knew who had given them these disasters. Under the brutal massacres and plunders of the butchers Xiao Jia-bi and Yin Hao-men, the people of Jinggang Mountain never yielded in the slightest. They constantly opposed the reactionary bandits' "encirclement and suppression." They fought for their own survival by resisting grain, resisting taxes, and, in the later period, resisting conscription, carrying out heroic and unyielding struggles against the enemy in all aspects.

For more than a decade, the people of Jinggang Mountain have never forgotten Chairman Mao, nor have they forgotten the Red Army. Last September, the day they had hoped for finally arrived. When the People's Liberation Army entered Jinggang Mountain, they selected representatives to welcome their own troops on the road, first reporting the whereabouts of the local bully Xiao Jia-bi, and actively cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to search in the deep mountains day and night, capturing Xiao Jia-bi. Everyone thanked Chairman Mao for avenging their deep-seated hatred of more than a decade and eliminating this scourge. The people of Jinggang Mountain also spontaneously launched a movement to pour out grievances against Xiao Jia-bi, transforming the slogan of "suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies" into the actions of the broad masses, and assisted the People's Liberation Army in quickly eliminating all the bandits in Jinggang Mountain. Since liberation in 1949, the social order on the mountain has been exceptionally good. One or two people can travel from Chaling and Ninggang through Wuyangjie to Zaolin Tuanjiang to do business, no longer afraid of bandits and索子兵 (unorganized soldiers) blocking the road and robbing them. Everyone says: Chairman Mao is back, and the world is at peace.

On the basis of suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, and refunding deposits, under the production call and assistance of the People's Government, the peasants actively engaged in production, reclaiming a total of 73 piculs of wasteland. Under the leadership of the Farmers' Association, they organized crop-watching teams by village, advocating mutual assistance in eliminating pests (wild boars, etc.). This year's harvest is 70 percent. Old farmer Liu Xin-lin said: "Jinggang Mountain has not had a good harvest since Chairman Mao left. Chairman Mao has just returned, and this year is a good harvest. This is Chairman Mao's great blessing."

This year's public grain task is: 12,465 catties for Dajing Township, 93,000 catties for Ciping Township, and 30,000 catties for Xiazhuang Township, totaling 135,465 catties, all of which have been completed quickly. For example, the distance from Da Xiaowujing to Huangao, where public grain is delivered, is 70 li. The township People's Government stipulated that it should be delivered within ten days, but the peasants completed the task within five days. The people of the old Soviet area have displayed a high degree of revolutionary spirit, which is worthy of our learning.

After liberation, the peasants here re-established their own organization—the Farmers' Association. It now has 731 members, accounting for one-third of the total population of 2,244. The militia has also been organized, with 327 militiamen, accounting for one-seventh of the total population. During the land reform, they automatically organized to stand guard, keep watch, prevent bandits from rising again, and monitor the actions of landlords. The peasants are even more enthusiastically learning culture and current events. After liberation, four elementary schools have been restored here, with 112 students; in addition, 11 night schools have been opened, with more than 230 students regularly attending. Because there is no kerosene, they use pine firewood for light, and every night they learn to read and read the "Jinggang Mountain Daily."

The people of Jinggang Mountain, liberated from the dark and cruel rule of Chiang bandits and local bullies, have begun to restore the stable and satisfying life of the Red Army era in the past year. In order to commemorate the sacred site of the Chinese revolution, all the people of Jinggang Mountain are writing to you, requesting that Chairman Mao's former residence be rebuilt in Jinggang Mountain, that a Mao Zedong Elementary School be established (located in Ciping), and that a memorial tower to the revolutionary martyrs of Jinggang Mountain and a cemetery for the martyrs be built.

In order to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the people of Jinggang Mountain, the Ji'an Special Office has decided to establish a Jinggang District in Jinggang Mountain to lead the people of Jinggang Mountain in building a new Jinggang Mountain.

　　中共江西省吉安地委书记李立
    向毛主席报告井岗山情况毛主席：
    吉安分区党政军民组织的井岗山慰问团，代表江西省各界人民，于一九五○年十一月十九日到达井岗山茨坪，大小五井一带；然后转道赴宁岗小江，向受尽国民党反动匪帮迫害的老苏区人民进行慰问，并发放粮食五万斤。十二月三日返回吉安。现将井岗山解放前后的情况报告如下：
    自从红军走后，在蒋匪和恶霸肖家壁、尹豪门等不断地摧残烧杀下，井岗山变成一片凄凉冷落的荒野，人口骤减，大小五井原有一百二十七户，现在只剩五十九户，原有人口五百八十二人，现在只剩二百七十九人，金竹山原有住民十一户，现在只剩下三个六十来岁的单身汉。这些人大部被出名的屠夫肖家壁所杀害。在解放前，田地荒废了三分之一，原有田二千一百二十八石，现在只剩下一千六百五十四石，产量亦大为减少。房子全部被烧光，连茅棚也未留一个。至于下庄、刘家坪、茨坪、白泥湖等地亦未例外。据调查结果，共烧掉房子二百九十一栋，计二千三百五十八间。
    在政治上，遂川从珠沙坳以上，永新从白泥湖以上，直到大小五井、八面山，被划为“匪区”，长期住扎着反动军队，不准老百姓出入，企图把当地人民困死在山沟里。尤其在快要解放时，恶霸肖家壁妄想依靠井岗山作为继续反人民的立足点，用恐怖手段强迫群众参加土匪队伍。
    在经济上，因劳动力大减，田地、山场大量荒芜，加上敌人五花八门地剥削农民，以及由于人烟稀少而野兽激增，野猪成群，过去没见过的山牛也出现了，这接连不断的匪祸天灾，就造成连年歉收的严重灾情。每年的收成在四成以下，甚至有些地方连谷种也收不回来。农民生活异常困苦。
    但是井岗山的人民连小孩子都深深知道这些灾难是谁给他们的。在屠夫肖家壁、尹豪门残酷屠杀抢掠下，井岗山的人民并没有丝毫屈服过。他们不断地反对反动匪徒们的“清剿”。以抗粮，抗捐，以及后一时期的反抽丁，来争取自己的生存，从各方面向敌人进行了英勇不屈的斗争。
    十几年来，井岗山人民一时一刻也没有忘记了毛主席，没有忘记了红军。去年九月，他们希望的那一天终于到来了。当人民解放军进入井岗山时，他们选派代表在路上欢迎着自己的队伍，首先报告恶霸肖家壁躲藏之处，并积极配合解放军不分昼夜地在深山中搜捕，将肖匪捉住。人人感谢毛主席给他们报了十几年来的深仇，除了这一害。井岗山人民并自动发起了反肖匪的诉苦运动，把当时“剿匪反霸”的口号形成为广大群众的行动，而且协助解放军很快地肃清了井岗山的全部土匪。从一九四九年解放到现在，山上的社会秩序异常良好。一、两个人可以从茶陵、宁岗经过五洋界到藻林团江做生意，再不怕这条路上会有土匪和索子兵来拦路抢劫了。人人说：毛主席回来了，天下就太平了。
    在剿匪、反霸、减租、退押的基础上，在人民政府的生产号召与扶助下，农民都积极生产，共开荒田七十三石。并在农会的领导下，以村为单位组织了看禾组，提倡互助除害（野猪等）。今年的收成有七成，老农柳辛林说：“井岗山自从毛主席走后年成就不好，毛主席刚回来，今年就是好年成，这是毛主席的福气大。”
    今年的公粮任务是：大井乡一万二千四百六十五斤，茨坪乡九万三千斤，下庄乡三万斤，共计十三万五千四百六十五斤，都很快完成了。如大小井送公粮到黄?相距七十里路，乡人民政府规定十天送完，但农民们五天内便完成了任务。老苏区的人民发扬了高度的革命精神，是值得我们学习的。
    解放以后，这里的农民又重新成立了自己的组织——农民协会，现在有会员七百三十一人，占总人口二千二百四十四人的三分之一。民兵也组织起来了，现有民兵三百二十七人，占总人口的七分之一。在土改期间，他们自动组织起来站岗、放哨，防范土匪再起和监视地主行动。农民们更热心地学习着文化和时事。解放后，这里恢复了小学四所，有学生一百一十二人；另外开办了夜校十一所，经常有学生二百三十余人。因为没有灯油，他们用松柴点亮，每晚识字和阅读《井岗山报》。
    从蒋匪和恶霸黑暗的残酷的统治下解放出来的井岗山人民，一年来，他们又重新开始恢复了红军时代的安定称心的生活。为了纪念中国革命的圣地，井岗山全体人民给你写信，请求在井岗山重建毛主席故居，举办毛泽东小学（地址建于茨坪），并修建井岗山革命先烈纪念塔和烈士公墓。
    为了发扬井岗山人民革命的光荣传统，吉安专署已决定在井岗山设井岗区，以便领导井岗山人民建设新的井岗山。
