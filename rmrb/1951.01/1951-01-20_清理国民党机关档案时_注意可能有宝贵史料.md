　　When Cleaning Up Kuomintang Agency Archives
    Pay Attention to Potentially Valuable Historical Materials
    Recently, I saw a notice from a cultural institution seeking Mr. Lu Xun's calligraphy (especially letters), unpublished works, and relics. I have a suggestion:
    Mr. Lu Xun's letters should occupy a significant portion of his works because Mr. Lu Xun wrote a great many letters to both acquaintances and strangers during his lifetime; however, these letters may not necessarily be preserved in the hands of the recipients. I remember writing to Mr. Lu Xun about a few questions and quickly receiving his reply. In the winter of 1936, I was arrested by Kuomintang secret agents in Qingdao, and my residence was also searched, with all books and clothing taken away; this letter from Mr. Lu Xun was among them. Mr. Lu Xun's many letters may be found in the archives of the Kuomintang secret service. I think that many of those who corresponded with Mr. Lu Xun at that time probably had a similar fate to mine, right?
    Therefore, if the archives of the Kuomintang secret service are being cleaned up now, please pay attention, as they may contain extremely valuable literary (or other) historical materials.

### 清理国民党机关档案时  注意可能有宝贵史料

　　清理国民党机关档案时
    注意可能有宝贵史料
    最近见到一个文化机关征求鲁迅先生遗墨（特别是书简）、佚文、遗物的通告，我有一点意见：
    鲁迅先生的书简应该在他的著作里占很大的分量，因为鲁迅先生生前给相识与不相识的人的信是极多的；但这些信不一定保存在收信人的手里。记得我曾经为几个问题写信给鲁迅先生，很快接到了他的回信。一九三六年冬天，我在青岛被国民党特务逮去，寓所也被查抄，书籍衣物全给拿光了；这封鲁迅先生的信也在内。国民党特务衙门里的档案中，可能找出先生的很多信。我想，那时和先生通信的人，有我那样命运的，该很不少吧？
    所以，如果现在清理国民党特务衙门里的档案，请注意，其中会有极宝贵的文学（或其他方面）史料。
