　　Lenin Lives in the Hearts of the People
　　Labor Model Li Yong
　　In October 1949, I went to the Soviet Union with the Chinese People's Cultural Workers Delegation to attend the 32nd anniversary celebration of the October Revolution. Seeing the happy life of the Soviet people, I thought of its founder—the great Comrade Lenin.
　　Some people say that Comrade Lenin is still alive. He lives in the hearts of the Soviet people and in the hearts of the people all over the world. This is absolutely true. In the Soviet Union, whether it is in government offices, schools, stations, rural areas, factories... there are Lenin's statues, sculptures, plaster figures, and portraits everywhere. There is also the Lenin Museum, which displays models, pictures, photographs, etc., recording Lenin's life deeds. These records are very detailed. For example, it mentioned that after the end of the civil war, the rural economy suffered great damage. Lenin personally led the economic construction. He carefully studied the emotions and demands of Russian farmers at that time. On January 18, 1921, he received farmers from the outskirts of Moscow and talked to them about issues such as plowing cattle, farm tools, and seeds. The farmers suggested to Lenin: "You care about us, and we also care about you. How about you go and see us?" Lenin went to the countryside soon after. He convened a small open-air lecture meeting for nearby farmers, patiently reporting the international and domestic situation to more than 300 farmers, explaining the situation, how to get out of difficulties, and how to restore and develop the rural economy. The farmers demanded of Lenin: "Dear Lenin, let us have 'electrification,' we have no lights!" Lenin made a suggestion to the government. In May 1923, Gorki had electrical wires installed, and nearby villages had electric lights. The villages all sent congratulatory letters to Lenin.
　　Going south from Moscow for twenty-eight kilometers, there is a mountain. There are gardens and large forests on the mountain. These trees are all more than a hundred years old; there is also a large area of houses, which is Lenin's residence, which still maintains the layout of Lenin's life. That is Lenin's office, reception room... Lenin met Stalin there, and the two sat on that chair to talk... The guide gave us a detailed explanation. Judging from the house and furnishings of the residence, Lenin's life was really very simple.
　　One day, we also paid our respects to Lenin's remains.
　　Lenin's tomb is on Red Square, and Lenin's coffin is in the basement of the Red Square reviewing stand. After we went in, the comrades of the delegation asked me and Li Fenglian to lay flowers. The basement is a beautiful hall, with a glass coffin in the middle, and Lenin is lying quietly inside, like sleeping. Looking at this revolutionary teacher, we didn't know what it tasted like in our hearts, and everyone lowered their heads in silence. When we came out, the door was already crowded with people. Among them were workers, collective farm members, government staff, students... It turned out that today was the opening day of Lenin's tomb. On this day, thousands of people, in groups, come to pay their respects to the remains of the great revolutionary teacher.
　　Today is the 27th anniversary of Lenin's death. To commemorate Lenin, we must learn from Lenin, learn from his fighting spirit, learn from his hard-working and simple style, and learn from his theories and ideas, so that we can improve in all aspects in order to better complete the revolutionary cause.

　　列宁活在人民心里
    劳动模范  李永
    一九四九年十月，我随中国人民文化职工代表团，到苏联参加十月革命三十二周年纪念大会，看到苏联人民的幸福生活，便想着它的创始人——伟大的列宁同志。
    有人说列宁同志还活着，他活在苏联人民的心里，活在全世界人民的心里。这话一点也不假，在苏联，不管是机关、学校、车站、农村、工厂……到处是列宁的雕像、塑像、石膏像、画像。还有列宁博物馆，里面陈列着模型、图画、照片等，记载列宁一生的事迹。这些记载非常详细，如说到内战结束以后，农村经济受到极大的破坏，列宁就亲自领导经济建设，他用心研究当时俄国农民的情绪和要求。一九二一年一月十八日，他接见了莫斯科近郊农民，和他们谈耕牛、农具、种子等问题。农民向列宁建议：“你关心我们，我们也关心你，你去我们那儿看看怎么样？“列宁不久就下乡去了。他召集附近农民开了个小小的露天讲演会，耐心地向三百多农民报告国际国内的形势，说明情况，怎样才能从困难里走出来，如何恢复和发展农民经济。农民向列宁要求道：“亲爱的列宁，让我们‘电气化’罢，我们没有灯！”列宁向政府作了建议，一九二三年五月，高尔可就装上电线，附近村庄有了电灯。各村都给列宁送来庆贺信。
    从莫斯科往南，走二十八公里，有一座山。山上有花园，有大树林，这些树都是一百年以上的老树；还有一大片房屋，这便是列宁的住宅，里面仍保持着列宁生前的摆设样式。那是列宁的办公室，会客室……列宁曾在那里接见斯大林，两个人坐在那只椅子上谈话……向导替我们作了详细解释。从住宅的房子和摆设来看，列宁的生活真是朴素极了。
    有一天，我们还瞻仰了列宁的遗容。
    列宁墓在红场上，列宁的灵柩就在红场检阅台的地下室。我们进去以后，代表团的同志，让我和李凤莲两人献花。地下室是个漂亮的大厅，正中间放着玻璃棺材，列宁静静地躺在里面，像睡觉一样。我们看着这位革命导师，心中不知是什么滋味，大家都低着头默默无声。当我们走出来的时候，门外已挤满了人。其中有工人，有集体农庄庄员，有机关工作人员，有学生……。原来今天是列宁墓开放日。每到这个日子，便有成千上万的人们，成群结队来瞻仰伟大革命导师的遗容。
    今天是列宁逝世二十七周年纪念日，我们纪念列宁，要向列宁学习，学习他的战斗精神，学习他艰苦朴素的作风，学习他的理论和思想，使我们各方面都提高一步，以便更好地完成革命事业。
