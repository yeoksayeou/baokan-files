To the Editor:

　　Article 23 of Chapter III "Military System" of the Common Program of the Chinese Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "The People's Republic of China implements a militia system to protect local order, establish a national mobilization base, and prepare to implement a conscription system at an appropriate time." I don't quite understand the nature of the militia system and the conscription system. Please explain. Zhang Zhen

Comrade Zhang Zhen:

Regarding the questions raised in your letter, the People's Armed Forces Department of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission has answered as follows:

　　The militia system is a special military system in our country's people's revolutionary war. The militia is a mass military organization of people organized on a voluntary basis without leaving production. The combination of labor and armament is the basic nature of the militia. The main tasks of the militia are to assist the People's Liberation Army and the Public Security Forces in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, such as carrying out bandit suppression operations, maintaining social order, actively participating in supporting front-line work, and protecting production and construction. The militia conducts military training under the principle of not violating farming seasons and undertakes the national mobilization tasks when necessary. It is the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army and undertakes the combined tasks of production personnel, security personnel, and combatants.

　　The conscription system is a system in which the government stipulates by law that citizens of a certain age have the obligation to be conscripted into military service; and receive considerable national military training before enlisting. They are drafted into the army when the country needs them (countries have different regulations on the length of service), and are transferred to the reserve after the expiration of the term. They are drafted into the army again when the country needs them. After the expiration of the reserve service within the prescribed age, the military service is terminated.

　　关于民兵制度与义务兵役制有何区别？编辑同志：
    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第三章《军事制度》第二十三条规定：“中华人民共和国实行民兵制度，保卫地方秩序，建立国家动员基础，并准备在适当时机实行义务兵役制。”我对于民兵制度和义务兵役制的性质不太了解。请解释。              张珍张珍同志：
    来信所询问题，已由中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会人民武装部解答如下：
    民兵制度是我国人民革命战争中的一种特殊军事制度。民兵是人民在自觉的基础上组织起来的不脱离生产的群众性的军事组织。劳动与武装结合是民兵的基本性质。民兵的主要任务是协助人民解放军与公安部队及巩固人民民主专政，如进行剿匪作战，维持社会治安，积极参加支援前线工作，保护生产建设等。民兵在不违农时的原则下实施军事训练，担负国家必要时期的动员任务。它是人民解放军的后备力量，担负着生产员、治安员、战斗员三者相结合的任务。
    义务兵役制，是由政府法令规定一定年龄的公民，有应征服兵役之义务；并在入伍前，接受相当的国民军事训练。在国家需要时即征召入伍（各国对服役年限均有不同的规定），期满后复员转入预备役，国家需要时则再征召入伍。在规定年龄内预备役期满后，即解除兵役。
