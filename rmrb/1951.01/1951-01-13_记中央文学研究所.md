　　Record of the Central Literary Research Institute
　　By our reporter Bai Yuan

　　On the morning of January 8th, a snowy day, in Beijing, on Gulou East Street in the north of the city, two large national flags of the People's Republic of China hung in front of the vermilion lacquered gate of a Chinese-style house. The heavy snow fell continuously, and the vermilion gate and bright national flags glowed in the white snow. This is the current location of the newly established Central Literary Research Institute, and today the first opening ceremony since its establishment is being held here.

　　The Central Literary Research Institute was founded according to the 1950 work plan of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the resolutions of the Fourth Enlarged Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1950 regarding work tasks. Preparations began last June, with a preparatory committee composed of twelve people including Ding Ling, Zhang Tianyi, Sha Kefu, Li Bozhao, Li Guangtian, He Qifang, Huang Yaomian, Yang Hui, Tian Jian, Kang Tuo, Jiang Tianzuo, and Chen Qixia, with Ding Ling and Zhang Tianyi as the director and deputy director, respectively. In early August of last year, the recruitment of researchers from various regions and military units began. There are currently fifty-one researchers who have already undergone two months of temporary study. These fifty-one researchers, who were recruited according to certain conditions, all have a certain level of literary accomplishment and considerable rich life and struggle experience, and some of them have already achieved a certain level of expression and achievement in literature.

　　Walking in through that vermilion gate, through those winding corridors, on one side of the corridor are the houses where the researchers live. The equipment in the houses is the same: a bed, a desk for study and writing, a bookshelf lined with various Marxist-Leninist theoretical books and literary works, and a warm stove. The simple life and the atmosphere of studying Marxist-Leninist theory and various literary works still maintain the traditions of literary and art workers in the old liberated areas. According to the plan formulated by the research institute, in the first year (1951), in terms of Marxist-Leninist theory, researchers must complete the study of "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" (Stalin) and a portion of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," read three essential Marxist-Leninist theoretical books for cadres, and study the basic policies related to national construction. Regarding the study of literary theory and works, researchers must complete the study of "Mao Zedong's Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and a brief history of Chinese and foreign literature. Writers are invited to report on their creative experiences, as well as Chinese classical literature and folk literature. Each researcher conducts research on issues and summarizes their own creative experience, and studies ten important masterpieces, starting with Chinese, modern, and Soviet works. In addition, each researcher is required to read about fifty famous literary works. In terms of creative writing, because the main effort in the first year is focused on the study of Marxism-Leninism, literary theory, and works, only exercises will be conducted in the first half of the year; in the second half of the year, some people will be organized to go to the countryside or factories, and some people will specialize in creative writing, with plans to create approximately 600,000 words of publishable works. In the second year (1952), in addition to continuing to study certain Marxist-Leninist theories and policies, in literature and art, researchers will study Marxist-Leninist literary theory and experts will be invited to give special reports on art. Each person will read another fifty masterpieces and study ten important ones. In terms of creative writing, creation will be organized in a planned way, striving to create 1.5 to 2 million words of publishable works throughout the year. After completion, researchers will graduate.

　　Today is the day the research institute is holding its opening ceremony. In addition to the director of the research institute, Ding Ling, the deputy director, Zhang Tianyi, and all the staff and researchers, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Sha Kefu, Li Bozhao, Li Guangtian, and others were present to participate. The ceremony did not involve any special rituals. In the conference room of the Literary Research Institute, in front of a large circular relief of Stalin and Chairman Mao, dozens of researchers and guests sat facing each other. Comrade Ding Ling introduced to everyone the process of establishing the research institute, its current situation, and the future research steps.

　　In his speech to everyone, Guo Moruo said: "It is the first time in Chinese history that a group of literary and art workers has been specially gathered to conduct systematic and step-by-step literary research work." Then, he said that literary art plays a great role in national construction, and good literary works can encourage the broad masses to carry out various national construction tasks. Whether a country is great depends, besides other aspects that can represent its greatness, on its great writers and scientists. China is no longer the China of the old days, and the Chinese people have stood up. Here, he introduced what he had seen abroad to illustrate the ardent expectations of the people of the world for China today, expecting us to produce things that play a guiding role in the world in literature, art, and science. And we ourselves now have very good conditions for creation. We have Chairman Mao's direction for literature and art, and we have the people's own regime. Writing materials are everywhere, especially the great victory of the Chinese people, and there are countless moving stories to tell. China is now a people's country, therefore, works that can thoroughly express the people's patriotism will also be works with international significance, and works that express the Chinese people and serve the Chinese people will also be works that can serve the people of the world.

　　Comrade Mao Dun hoped that the comrades of the Literary Research Institute would carry out various literary creation and research work under the central task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and promote the excellent results we have already achieved in literature. He said: The researchers of the research institute all have rich life experience, which is very important for literature, but here it is necessary to prevent an incorrect view, do not think that you already have life experience, and come to the Literary Research Institute only to learn skills, because skills also come from life. He encouraged everyone to study Marxist-Leninist theory hard. He expects the comrades of the Literary Research Institute to produce China's Gorky, Mayakovsky, and Shakespeare from among the researchers of the Literary Research Institute in the future.

　　Comrade Zhou Yang asked the comrades of the Literary Research Institute to first study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought well in their studies. He said: It is a serious task for literary and art workers to strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. It is wrong to think that you can engage in literary creation without studying theory. To truthfully express life in our works, we must not only have a certain life experience, but also have the ability to observe, study, analyze, and synthesize various life phenomena, which requires the help of theory. "Mao Zedong's Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the main thing we should study. The second is to study literary history, especially Chinese literary history. Taking the study of literary history as the center, studying representative works of various eras, sorting out and critically accepting the rich Chinese literary heritage is an extremely important task. The third is to conduct writing practice, to write articles frequently and constantly, to polish them more, and to pay attention to the grammar and rhetoric of the language. The Literary Research Institute must combine literary research, creation, and learning.

　　Comrade Li Bozhao said: "We must accept our literary heritage well and use the spirit of patriotism to promote our past achievements in literature."

　　The meeting continued until noon. After lunch, after seeing the guests off, Comrades Ding Ling and Zhang Tianyi were together with the comrades of the research institute again, using many vivid and specific examples to explain to everyone how to better improve everyone's thinking, improve the quality of revolutionary literary and art workers, and complete everyone's literary career.

　　From the establishment of the Central Literary Research Institute and from the earnest words of these many literary predecessors, we see the importance and concern of our government and literary predecessors for cultivating young Chinese literary and art workers. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong literary and art thought, and under the cultivation of our country, we will see the literary and art movement of the New China develop vigorously with the great victory of the Chinese people, and it will shine brightly in the history of Chinese literature.

　　记中央文学研究所
    本报记者  白原
    一月八日，一个下雪的早晨，在北京北城边的鼓楼东大街上，一座中国式房子的朱红油漆大门前，挂着两面很大的中华人民共和国的国旗。大雪纷纷的下着，朱红的大门和鲜艳的国旗在皑皑的白雪中发着光彩。这就是刚刚成立的中央文学研究所现在的所在地，今天在这里举行成立以后的第一个开学典礼。
    中央文学研究所，是根据中央人民政府文化部一九五○年的工作计划以及全国文联四届扩大常委会一九五○年工作任务的决议而创办起来的。去年六月开始筹备，由丁玲、张天翼、沙可夫、李伯钊、李广田、何其芳、黄药眠、杨晦、田间、康濯、蒋天佐、陈企霞等十二个人组成筹备委员会，以丁玲、张天翼为正副主任委员。去年八月初，开始从各地区、各部队征调研究员。现已有研究员五十一人，而且已经进行了两个月的临时学习。按照一定的条件所调集的这五十一个研究员，都有一定的文学修养及相当丰富的生活、斗争经验，其中有些人在文学上已经有了一定的表现和成就。
    从那一座朱红的大门走进去，通过那些曲曲折折的走廊，在走廊的一旁，就是研究员们所住的房子。房子里的设备都是同样的：一张卧床，一张学习和写作用的书棹，一个排列着各种马列主义理论书籍以及文艺作品的书架，一个温暖的火炉子。朴素的生活，对于马列主义理论以及各种文艺作品的钻研的气氛，依然保持着过去老解放区文艺工作者的传统。根据研究所拟定的计划，第一年（一九五一年），在马列主义理论方面，研究员须要学完“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”（斯大林）以及“毛泽东选集”的一部分，读三本干部必读的马列主义理论书籍，并研究有关国家建设的基本政策。对文艺理论以及作品的研究，须要学完“毛主席在延安文艺座谈会的讲话”及简要的中外文学史。请作家报告创作经验以及中国古典文学与民间文学。每个研究员进行研究问题与总结自己的创作经验，并从中国的、近代的、苏联的作品开始，研究十部重要名著。此外，还要求每个研究员阅读五十本左右的著名文艺作品。在创作方面，因为第一年主要的力量放在马列主义、文艺理论及作品的研究上，上半年只进行习作；下半年组织一部分人下乡或下厂，一部分人专门进行创作，计划创作能出版的作品约六十万字。第二年（一九五二年）除继续研究一定的马列主义理论与政策外，在文艺上，研究马列主义文艺理论，请专家作关于艺术的专题报告。每人再读五十本名著，研究十本重要的。在创作方面，有计划的组织创作，争取全年创作能出版的作品一百五十万至二百万字。完成后毕业。
    今天是研究所举行开学典礼的日子，参加这个典礼的，除了研究所的主任丁玲、副主任张天翼以及全体工作人员和研究员以外，到会参加的有郭沫若、茅盾、周扬、沙可夫、李伯钊、李广田等。典礼并没有举行什么特别的仪式。在文学研究所的会议室里，在一个很大的斯大林和毛主席的圆形浮雕像前面，几十位研究员和来宾们相对着坐在一起。丁玲同志将研究所创办的经过、现在的情况以及今后研究的步骤向大家作了介绍。
    郭沫若在对大家的讲话中说：“专门集中一批文艺工作者有系统、有步骤的进行文学的研究工作，在中国的历史上是第一次。”接着，他说：文学艺术对于国家建设是有很大作用的，好的文艺作品可以鼓动广大群众去进行各种国家建设的工作。一个国家的是否伟大，除了其他方面可以代表她的伟大的东西以外，就是以她的伟大的文学家及科学家为代表的。中国已经不是旧时代的中国，中国人民已经站起来了。在这里，他介绍了他在国外所看到的情况，来说明世界人民今天对中国的热烈的期待，期待我们在文艺、科学等方面产生对世界起指导作用的东西。而我们自己，今天又有了很好的创作的条件。我们有了毛主席的文艺方向，有了人民自己的政权。写作的材料遍地都是，特别是中国人民的伟大的胜利，可歌可泣的故事不知有多少。中国现在已经是人民的国家，因此，能够彻底表现人民的爱国主义的作品，一定也就是具有国际意义的作品，表现中国人民的作品，能为中国人民服务的作品，一定也就是能为世界人民服务的作品。
    茅盾同志希望文学研究所的同志在抗美援朝的中心任务之下，进行各种文学的创作与研究工作，发扬我们在文学上已经获得的优良的成果。他说：研究所的研究员都有很丰富的生活经验，对文学来说，这是很重要的，但是在这里要防止一种不正确的观点，不要认为自己已经有了生活经验，到文学研究所来，只是为了学习技巧，因为技巧也是从生活当中来的。他勉励大家努力学习马列主义的理论。他以将来从文学研究所的研究员当中产生中国的高尔基、马雅可夫斯基和莎士比亚来期待文学研究所的同志们。
    周扬同志要求文学研究所的同志们在学习当中，第一要很好的学习马列主义，学习毛泽东思想。他说：文艺工作者加强马列主义理论的学习，是一个严重的任务。认为从事文艺创作可以不学习理论是错误的。我们要在作品中真实地表现生活，不但要有一定生活经验，而且要有观察、研究、分析与综合各种生活现象的能力，这就要依靠理论的帮助。“毛主席在延安文艺座谈会的讲话”是我们主要学习的东西。第二是学习文学史，尤其是中国文学史，以学习文学史为中心，研究各个时代的代表作品，整理与批判地接受丰富的中国文学遗产，是一个极重要的任务。第三要进行写作实习，要经常不断地写作、写文章，要多推敲，要注意语言的文法和修辞。文学研究所必须将文学研究、创作与学习三者结合起来。
    李伯钊同志说：“我们要把我们的文学遗产好好的接受下来，要以爱国主义的精神来发挥我们过去在文学上的成就。”
    会议一直开到中午，吃过中饭，把客人送走以后，丁玲、张天翼两同志又和研究所的同志们在一起，用许多生动的、具体的例子对大家说明应该怎样更好的提高每个人的思想，提高革命的文艺工作者的品质，来完成每一个人在文学上的事业。
    从中央文学研究所的成立，从这许多文学前辈们的殷切的话语，我们看见我们的政府和文学前辈们对培养中国青年文艺工作者的重视与关怀。在马列主义以及毛泽东文艺思想的指导之下，在我们国家的培养之下，我们将要看见新中国的文艺运动，随着中国人民伟大的胜利而蓬勃的发展起来，而且将要在中国文学的历史上发出灿烂的光辉。
