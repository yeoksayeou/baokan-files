Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 4th. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) issued a message here on the 4th to workers and trade union members worldwide, celebrating May Day. The message calls for this year's May Day "to become a new and important stage on the road to unified action by workers and trade unions around the world."

After expressing its fraternal greetings and wishes for peace and international solidarity, the WFTU called on workers worldwide to take unified action to strive for peace, to end nuclear weapons testing and the "Cold War," to demand the convocation of a summit conference to resolve disputes through negotiation, especially the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the Berlin issue, to demand recognition and respect for the national independence of all countries, and to end the colonial war in Algeria.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 4th. The 19th session of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions continued on the 3rd. The meeting discussed the report by Grassi on "Expanding the Tasks of the World Federation of Trade Unions in the Struggle for Peace" and heard the report by WFTU Secretary Marcel Bras on the third item on the agenda—the struggle of working people to achieve social and economic demands.

During the discussion of Grassi's report, Grishin, Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, spoke. He said that without the struggle of the working people for lasting peace and for peaceful coexistence among nations, the conditions of the working people cannot be improved, and the attacks of reactionary forces will not be effectively repelled. He said that the Soviet trade unions and all the working people of the Soviet Union fully support the WFTU and its struggle to unite the world working class on a powerful anti-war front.

Liu Changsheng, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that the anti-colonialist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have consistently received the support of the WFTU and all progressive trade union forces. During the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, the WFTU and other trade union organizations supported the Chinese people, for which the Chinese working people express their sincere gratitude.

Liu Changsheng said that the WFTU attaches importance to the trade union movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but it should provide these countries' trade unions with greater assistance and support.

After the discussion, Bras continued to deliver a report on "Carrying Out the Struggle of the Working People to Achieve Social and Economic Demands."

Bras gave a detailed analysis of the struggle of the working class in capitalist countries in the past year. When talking about the tasks of the WFTU and its affiliated trade union organizations in striving for unity of action among working people, he said that it is necessary to expand the contacts between trade union organizations of various countries and continuously exchange experiences with each other, regardless of which central trade union organization these trade union organizations belong to.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 5th. The 19th session of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions continued on the 5th. Trade union representatives from countries such as Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Cyprus, India, and Poland spoke at the meeting.

WFTU Secretary Peña reported on the fourth item on the agenda: carrying out the trade union struggle in Latin America. He said that Latin America is advancing on various complex and difficult roads. National liberation, economic development, social progress, democracy, and peace are achieving great victories in Latin America.

While political changes are taking place in Latin American countries, the trade union movement is also developing, the unity of workers and trade unions is strengthening, and the struggle to meet the demands of the working people has achieved many new successes.

Peña continued by saying that in all Latin American countries, the activities of the working class are constantly strengthening. A magnificent struggle against the attacks of business owners and to improve the living conditions of the masses is constantly unfolding. The struggle of the masses in Latin American countries against US imperialism and for national and democratic demands is also strengthening.

Peña concluded by saying that the WFTU has strongly supported the working people of Latin America. In the future, it will further strengthen this support.

    世界工联执委会会议上各国代表强调加强工人行动一致的重要性
    新华社布拉格电　世界工会联合会书记处4日在这里发表了向全世界工人、工会会员庆贺“五一”节的贺信，贺信号召把今年的“五一”节“变成在全世界工人和工会采取统一行动的道路上的一个新的重要阶段。”
    世界工联在表达了它的兄弟祝贺以及希望和平和国际团结的祝愿后，它号召全世界工人采取统一行动来争取和平，争取结束核武器试验和“冷战”，要求召开最高级会议，通过谈判解决争端问题、特别是缔结对德和约问题和柏林问题，要求承认和尊重一切国家的民族独立并结束阿尔及利亚的殖民战争。
    新华社华沙4日电　世界工会联合会执行委员会第十九次会议3日继续举行。会议讨论了葛拉西作的关于“扩大世界工会联合会在争取和平的斗争中的任务”的报告，并且听取了世界工联书记马塞尔·布拉就会议的第三项议程——关于开展劳动人民争取实现社会和经济要求的斗争——所作的报告。
    在讨论葛拉西的报告时，苏联工会中央理事会主席格里申发了言。他说，如果没有劳动人民争取持久和平、争取各国和平共处的斗争，劳动人民的状况便不能得到改善，反动势力的进攻便不会受到有力的回击。他说，苏联工会和苏联全体劳动人民完全支持世界工联，支持它为把世界工人阶级团结在一条强大的反战争阵线上而进行的斗争。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜说，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的反殖民主义斗争一直得到世界工联和所有进步工会力量的支持。在台湾海峡局势紧张期间，世界工联和其他工会组织支持了中国人民，中国劳动人民对此表示非常感谢。
    刘长胜说，世界工联重视亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的工会运动，但是它还应当给予这些国家的工会以更大的援助和支持。
    讨论结束后，布拉接着在会上作了关于“开展劳动人民争取实现社会和经济要求的斗争”的报告。
    布拉详细分析了资本主义国家工人阶级在最近一年的斗争情况。他在谈到世界工联和它所属的工会组织在争取劳动人民的行动一致方面的任务时说，应当扩大各国工会组织之间的联系和不断交流彼此的经验，而不管这些工会组织属于那一个中央工会组织。
    新华社华沙5日电　世界工会联合会执行委员会第十九次会议5日继续举行。在会上发言的有印度尼西亚、伊朗、意大利、塞浦路斯、印度、波兰等国的工会代表。
    世界工联书记培尼亚就第四项议程：开展拉丁美洲工会斗争作了报告。他说，拉丁美洲正在各种复杂而困难的道路上前进。民族解放、经济发展、社会进步、民主与和平事业正在拉丁美洲取得巨大胜利。
    在拉丁美洲各国发生政治变革的同时，工会运动也在发展，工人和工会的团结在加强，争取满足劳动人民要求的斗争取得了许多新的成就。
    培尼亚接着说，在所有拉丁美洲国家，工人阶级的活动在不断加强。反对企业主进攻，争取改善人民群众生活条件的壮阔斗争正在不断开展。拉丁美洲各国群众反对美帝国主义，争取民族、民主要求的斗争也加强了。
    培尼亚最后说，世界工联曾大力声援了拉丁美洲的劳动人民。今后它将进一步加强这种支持。
