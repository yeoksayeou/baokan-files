Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 6th. Trials conducted by the Toutuo People's Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang, have proven that spraying wheat straw ash water on wheat can prevent lodging.

The experimental wheat field cultivated by cadres of the Toutuo People's Commune is growing exceptionally well, with wheat stalks already chest-high. In mid-March, due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer application, some wheat suddenly lodged. The Commune Party Committee immediately convened veteran farmers and technical cadres to study how to remedy the situation. Veteran farmer Pan Qitou suggested using wheat straw ash water. He said that during the early rice ripening period last year, they conducted four experiments to prevent early rice lodging. The results showed that early rice sprayed with clean water, fertilizer powder, and superphosphate still experienced lodging, while the early rice sprayed with wheat straw ash water remained upright.

Based on Pan Qitou's suggestion, the Toutuo People's Commune Party Committee sprayed wheat straw ash water on the lodging wheat in the experimental field. They sprayed it once every other day. After two sprays, the partially lodged wheat completely stood upright, and after four more sprays, the wheat stalks became even stronger. Therefore, the Toutuo People's Commune Party Committee held a special meeting to promote this method. After research, the Huangyan County agricultural leadership departments also required widespread promotion throughout the county.

The method for making and spraying wheat straw ash water is very simple. Burn twenty catties of wheat straw (or early rice straw) into ash, mix it with one hundred catties of hot water to make ash water, soak it for a day and a night, filter out the residue, and spray it on the wheat leaves with a sprayer on alternate mornings after the dew has dried. If two catties of superphosphate are added to every hundred catties of ash water, it can also promote larger ears and grains.

According to research by agricultural technology departments, wheat straw ash water can prevent rice and wheat lodging because it contains a large amount of potash fertilizer, which can make rice and wheat stalks strong. At the same time, because it is foliar fertilization, the ash water is quickly absorbed by the stomata on the leaves, so it is effective quickly.

### 黄岩头陀公社创造防伏妙方  喷洒麦秆灰汁  稻麦茎秆坚硬

    黄岩头陀公社创造防伏妙方
    喷洒麦秆灰汁
    稻麦茎秆坚硬
    新华社杭州6日电　浙江黄岩县头陀人民公社的试验证明：向小麦喷施麦秆灰汁，可以防止小麦倒伏。
    头陀人民公社干部种的一丘小麦试验田长得特别好，麦秆已有齐胸高。3月中旬，因施氮肥过多，部分小麦突然倒伏。公社党委立即召集老农和技术干部研究如何挽救。老农潘起头提出了施用麦秆灰汁的办法。他说，去年早稻成熟期间，他们曾进行过四种防止早稻倒伏的试验，结果喷射清水、肥田粉和过磷酸钙的早稻仍然发生倒伏现象，而喷射麦秆灰汁的早稻全部直立。
    头陀人民公社党委根据潘起头意见，在试验田开始倒伏的小麦上喷射了麦秆灰汁，隔天喷射一次，喷射两次后半倒伏的小麦就全部直立起来，再经过四次喷射，小麦茎秆更加坚硬。因此，头陀人民公社党委专门召开会议推广了这个办法。黄岩县农业领导部门经过研究后，也要求全县各地普遍推广。
    制造和喷射麦秆灰汁的方法很简单。用麦秆（或早稻秆）烧灰二十斤，冲热水一百斤，泡成灰汁，浸一天一夜后滤去渣，隔天上午露水干后用喷雾器喷射在小麦叶上。如果每百斤灰汁掺入两斤过磷酸钙，还能促使穗粗粒大。
    据农业技术部门研究，麦秆灰汁所以能防止稻麦倒伏，是因为它含有大量钾肥，能使稻麦茎秆坚硬。同时又因为是根外施肥，灰汁很快被叶上气孔吸收，因此见效快。
