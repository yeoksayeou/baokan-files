    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, April 17th: According to TASS, Rome, April 16th: One million Italian metalworkers and machine manufacturing workers held a 24-hour strike on the 16th. This strike is one of the largest strikes by the Italian working people in recent years. The strikers demanded that the new collective contract between labor and management stipulate a 7% to 9% increase in workers' wages, a shorter working day without a reduction in wages, and an increase in holidays.
    Italy’s three largest trade unions—the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the Italian Confederation of Labor Trade Unions, and the Italian Labor Union—took concerted action in this strike.

    Demanding Improved Work Contracts
    American Rubber Workers Persist in Strike Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch, TASS, New York, April 11: According to preliminary materials released by the US Department of Labor, American unions conducted 300 strikes in February of this year. A total of 140,000 workers participated in the strikes, double the number from a year earlier.
    The largest and most persistent strikes were at the "Plate Glass Company" glass factories, the "Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company" agricultural machinery factories, and the New York bakers' strike.
    Our Newspaper Dispatch, New York: American rubber industry workers have been on strike for a week to support demands for increased pensions, labor insurance, and additional benefits in the new work contract. The number of strikers is constantly increasing, and by the 16th, 58,000 workers had left their jobs. The strikers include workers from three major companies: American Rubber Company, Firestone Company, and Goodyear Company.

    Negotiations on Wage Increases Break Down
    Bolivian Oil Workers Stop Work
    Our Newspaper Dispatch, La Paz: Approximately 7,000 workers at the Bolivian state-owned oil company went on strike on the 16th, paralyzing the nation's oil production. This strike was triggered by the breakdown of negotiations on wage increases.

    Impoverished Life Incites a Wave of Struggle
    Argentine Workers in Various Industries Strike Continuously
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Buenos Aires: Due to the continuous rise in prices and the increasingly impoverished lives of the working people, workers in many industries in Argentina have been continuously staging strikes recently, demanding that the government increase wages.
    The national bank and insurance company employees, who had already held a five-day strike at the end of March, held another 24-hour strike on the 14th, followed by an announcement of an indefinite general strike on the 15th. The strikers strongly protested the police's arrest of seventeen union leaders and employees and the occupation of the two unions. They demanded a wage increase of 1,500 pesos.
    In Rosario, the strike by municipal government employees had entered its thirty-third day on the 14th. They held several demonstrations and marches in the streets, demanding wage increases. The strike by Avellaneda municipal government employees, which began on April 11, will continue indefinitely.
    In Córdoba province, the strike by 3,000 workers at the Kaiser automobile factory, an American enterprise, has continued for nearly three weeks. The strike by the workers at this automobile factory has received the support of mechanics at automobile factories throughout the country.
    Buenos Aires dockworkers, who have conducted multiple strikes in recent months, held another 24-hour strike on the 13th. They demanded higher wages and opposed the government's decree interfering with union rights. According to reports, to protest the government's continued interference in union affairs, the textile workers' union recently announced that it would strike for one hour each day starting on the 17th, gradually increasing the strike by one hour each day until the government meets their demands.
    It is reported that although the Argentine government declared all strikes illegal as early as mid-January of this year and adopted various repressive measures against striking workers, all these measures have failed to stop the workers' strike struggles.

    Brazilian authorities have sent police to suppress the striking workers. It is reported that the Brazilian Second Army and thousands of state reservists have been placed on "alert" under government orders.
