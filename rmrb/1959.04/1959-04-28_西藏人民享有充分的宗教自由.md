The Tibetan people have enjoyed full freedom of religious belief in the eight years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Lama temples in various parts of Tibet, regardless of their sect, have been protected and respected, and religious activities have continued as usual; the income of the temples has not been changed in any way. During the suppression of the rebellion, the People's Liberation Army did its best to protect the temples from damage.

The central government's consistent policy of religious freedom and protection of lama temples has been warmly supported by the Tibetan clergy and laity. The allegation in the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" that religious freedom was interfered with is completely unfounded. (Attached pictures)

    西藏人民享有充分的宗教自由
    西藏和平解放八年来，藏族人民享有充分的宗教信仰自由。西藏各地的喇嘛寺院，不论是那一教派的，都受到保护和尊重，宗教活动照常进行；寺院的收入没有任何变更。在这次平乱中，人民解放军尽量保护寺院，使其不受破坏。
    中央一贯坚持宗教信仰自由和保护喇嘛寺院的政策，受到了西藏僧俗人民的热烈拥护。所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中所说的干涉宗教自由，是毫无根据的。（附图片）
    上左：1958年7月25日（藏历6月9日），达赖喇嘛赴哲蚌寺开始考“格西”——喇嘛教中一种最高的学位。按照西藏的宗教惯例，历世达赖喇嘛都必须进行这种考试。这是达赖喇嘛在和哲蚌寺的堪布辩论经典。
    上右：传召大会期间，拉萨各寺院的活佛和喇嘛们在大昭寺前听讲经。
    下左：藏历土狗年（公历1958年）的“跳神”盛会在布达拉宫顶上举行。这是喇嘛乐队开始演奏。
