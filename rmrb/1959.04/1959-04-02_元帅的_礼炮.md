    Marshal's "Salute"
    Ziyue

    Marshal Montgomery ridiculed the North Atlantic Alliance as "becoming a group of mutual congratulation," but he couldn't help but send a salute to the alliance's tenth anniversary that wasn't exactly a form of ridicule.

    The reason it's not exactly a form of ridicule is that the Marshal's salute is a full-fledged time bomb that's already set to explode.

    The Marshal has long been dissatisfied with the state of the alliance, and he even threw his hat in the ring, resigning from his position as Deputy Supreme Commander of the alliance. Subsequently, he proposed that the commander of the alliance be replaced by a European and that the alliance's highest body be moved from Washington to Paris. At the time, people appropriately regarded the Marshal's request as a signal of London and Washington vying for leadership of the alliance.

    Now, Montgomery's sharp edge is still directed at American leadership. However, it appears even sharper and can be described as a comprehensive attack. He loudly proclaimed: the American leadership "is time for a change." At the same time, he unequivocally demanded that "Britain must stand up." These are all things the Marshal hadn't said so frankly in the past.

    This is certainly not due to a momentary excitement on the part of the Marshal, because during Macmillan's recent visit to Washington, Britain was already shouting that the leadership of the West should be Britain's turn. So, it is very clear that this Marshal, who is proficient in strategy and tactics, has cleverly seized the moment.

    The Marshal's sharp edge is not only here.

   This time, he is openly taking the stance of "a good general" to conduct a comprehensive review of the North Atlantic Alliance after a battle to see "what needs to be improved, where the organization is inflexible, where the command structure is failing, where changes are needed, and where there are wasteful and inefficient phenomena, etc." This fully demonstrates that the Marshal's time bomb is no small matter.

    The conclusions the Marshal drew from the review are bold and filled with resentment. His conclusions are:

    There is no common policy within the North Atlantic Alliance; it is numb and unwilling to face facts; it is a group of countries with inconsistent goals, too many institutions, too much infighting; and only allies in name; ...

    But where is the crux of the problem? In a word, it lies in the fact that the United States monopolizes power, and the United States wants "merger" rather than "cooperation." The Marshal is not frank enough in that he is unwilling to say how much sovereignty has been lost by many allies under the high-handedness of the United States.

    However, the remedy proposed by the Marshal falls precisely on the issue of sovereignty. For example, he advocates that the troops of the countries participating in the alliance must be commanded by their own countries; the entire command structure must be revised. Of course, what is particularly important here is that there must be a deserved place for Britain.

    Obviously, no one will doubt the Marshal's assessment of the alliance's existence. The Marshal is loyal to this alliance, and he is even afraid that people will have such doubts, so he vigorously publicized the "astonishing achievements of the North Atlantic Alliance." He even insisted that this aggressive group preparing for war "has prevented a war from breaking out in Europe," and, originally, "it has already fought a victorious battle"! However, when the Marshal was boasting, he could not cite half a point of fact about the "achievements." Since this alliance is such a mess in the eyes of the Marshal, how can it achieve "achievements"?

    It seems that even the Marshal himself, who has slapped himself in the face, has little confidence in the alliance. He said that the alliance "change is inevitable, but progress is not inevitable." So that's how it is.

    As for the Marshal's desire for Britain to stand up, what about the confidence? It seems not great either. He lamented: "Unfortunately, we (referring to Britain) always have to plug colonial loopholes," and this loophole has given "the Americans an opportunity." He is very dissatisfied with the Americans' self-proclaimed "holier than thou" "anti-colonial attitude." He angrily said that this is "how unreasonable." However, the Americans always tightly grasp the tail of the British lion, therefore, when the Marshal shouts "Britain must stand up," he still dare not say that he wants to replace the leadership of the United States, but only helplessly says that Britain must "serve as some kind of spiritual middleman."

    In any case, the Marshal's salute was fired at the right time. On this point, the Marshal is confident.

### 元帅的“礼炮”

    元帅的“礼炮”
    子曰
    蒙哥马利元帅讥讽北大西洋联盟“正在成为互相祝贺的团体”，但他也情不自禁地给这个联盟十周年纪念送了一个不算是讥讽性质的礼炮。
    所以说不算是讥讽性质者，因为元帅的礼炮是一枚不折不扣的已经到了爆炸时间的定时炸弹。
    元帅早就对这个联盟的状况很不满，他还因而掼了纱帽，辞去了联盟副统帅的职位。接着，他提出了把联盟统帅改由欧洲人担任，并把联盟最高机构从华盛顿移到巴黎的要求。当时人们恰当地把元帅的这个要求看作是伦敦和华盛顿争夺联盟领导权的信号。
    现在，蒙哥马利的锋芒，仍然是指向美国的领导。但，更显得锋利，并且可以说是全面的进攻。他大声高呼：美国的领导“已经是该改变的时候了”。同时，他一点不含糊地要求“英国必须站出来”。这都是过去元帅所没有这么坦率说过的话。
    这当然不是由于元帅一时的激动，因为，在最近麦克米伦访问华盛顿的时候，英国就大喊大叫：西方的首脑应该轮到英国的领导人了。所以，很显然，这位精通战略战术的元帅是机智地掌握了时机的。
    元帅的锋芒之犀利，还不仅在这里。
   他这回是公开以“一名优秀的将军”的姿态，要在打了一场战役之后来全面检查北大西洋联盟“哪些地方需要改进，哪里组织不灵便，哪里指挥机构失灵，哪里需要改变，哪里存在着浪费和效率不高的现象，等等。”这就充分显示出元帅的定时炸弹非同小可。
    元帅检查得出的结论是大胆的，并且还充满着怨气。他的结论是：
    北大西洋联盟内部没有共同政策；麻木不仁，不肯面对事实；这是一团目标不一致的国家，机构太多，争吵太多；而且只是名义上的盟国；……
    但症结在哪里呢？一句话，在于美国独揽大权，美国要“合并”，而不是要“合作”。元帅不够坦率的地方是，他不愿说出在美国的作威作福下，多少盟国丧失了多少主权。
    不过，元帅提出的药方，恰恰是落在主权上。譬如，他主张参加联盟的各国部队必须由各国统率；整个指挥结构必须修正。当然，这里特别重要的是，必须有个英国的应得地位。
    显然，没有人会对元帅对这个联盟存在的估价有什么怀疑。元帅是忠于这个联盟的，而且他还唯恐人们会产生这种怀疑，因而大事宣传了一番“北大西洋联盟的成就是惊人的”。他甚至硬说这个准备战争的侵略集团“已经防止了欧洲发生一次大战”，并且，原来，“它已经打了一次胜仗”！只是，元帅在大吹大擂的时候，举不出“成就”的半点事实来。既然这个联盟在元帅眼中是如此一团糟，又怎么取得“成就”的呢？
    看来，连自打了嘴巴的元帅自己对联盟的信心也是不大的。他说这个联盟“改变是必然的，而进步则不是必然的”。原来如此。
    至于元帅要英国站出来，信心又如何呢？看来也不大。他哀叹地说：“不幸的是，我们（指英国）总是必须堵塞殖民漏洞”，而这个漏洞，给了“美国人以可乘之机”。他对于美国人自命“比你圣洁”的“反殖民主义态度”，很不服气。他愤然说，这是“多么没有道理”。但是，美国人总是紧紧地抓住了英国狮子的尾巴，因而，元帅叫喊“英国必须站出来”的时候，还不敢说要取代美国的领导地位，而只是无可奈何地说英国要“充任某种精神上的中间人”。
    不管怎样，元帅的礼炮，放得恰到时候。这一点，元帅却是有信心的。
