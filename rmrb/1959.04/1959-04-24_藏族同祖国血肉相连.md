Representative Huang Zhengqing said: What the Tibetan ethnic group and the Tibetan people want is the unity of the motherland, not the division of the motherland; ethnic unity, not ethnic separation; the bright and happy road, not the dark and painful abyss.
Fellow representatives:
I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. As a Tibetan representative, I firmly support the Central People's Government's policy of thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion, gradually carrying out social reforms in Tibet, and implementing national regional autonomy. (Applause)

    The Rebel Elements Want to Turn Tibet into a Foreign Colony
    What the Tibetan People Want is a Strong, Unified Motherland

Tibet has always been a sacred territory of our motherland. The Tibetan ethnic group, like other fraternal ethnic groups, has contributed to the creation of our motherland and, in this process, has formed an inseparable relationship with other fraternal ethnic groups. The Tibetan ethnic group is a member of the big family of the motherland. It was only due to imperialist aggression that a non-patriotic tendency arose in Tibet. The peaceful liberation of Tibet returned Tibet to the embrace of the motherland and realized the unity of the motherland. All of this can be verified by historical facts and cannot be distorted by anyone. We, the Tibetan people of Gannan, know this especially clearly. The former Tibetan local government and the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, who took refuge in imperialism, colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and foreign reactionaries, launched an armed rebellion, and conspired so-called "Tibetan independence," this is a thorough betrayal of the country. The Central People's Government, in order to safeguard the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity, has taken resolute measures to quell the Tibetan rebellion, which is entirely an exercise of our country's sovereignty and entirely our internal affair. Outsiders have no right to interfere. Otherwise, it is interference in our internal affairs, a violation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and an unfriendly act towards our country. (Enthusiastic applause) The destiny of the motherland is closely related to the destiny of our ethnic groups. In the years when our motherland suffered from imperialist aggression and reactionary rule, the experiences of all ethnic groups were filled with tragedy, pain, and blood. Today, in the powerful and unified big family of the motherland under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all our ethnic groups enjoy warmth and happiness and have embarked on the road of prosperity and development. Common ideals and common goals have linked the destinies of all ethnic groups more closely together. The unity of the motherland is the common highest interest of all ethnic groups. For the people of all ethnic groups who have suffered under the oppression of imperialism and reactionaries, is there anything more precious than a strong and unified motherland? (Applause) Without the highest interests of all ethnic groups, there is no way to talk about ethnic interests at all. The former Tibetan local government and the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique pretended to represent the interests of the Tibetan ethnic group in order to cover up their treasonous crimes. In fact, this is futile. What the Tibetan ethnic group and the Tibetan people want is the unity of the motherland, not the division of the motherland; ethnic unity, not ethnic separation; the faithful implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, not the tearing up of this agreement; the bright and happy road, not the dark and painful abyss. These rebel elements are colluding with foreign countries, undermining the unity of the motherland, trying to turn Tibet into a foreign colony or protectorate, and pushing the Tibetan people into a deep abyss. Where does their behavior represent the true interests of the Tibetan ethnic group? Betraying the motherland is betraying the interests of one's own ethnic group. The eyes of the people are sharp. The criminal activities of the rebel elements have been resolutely opposed by the people of all ethnic groups in the country, especially the Tibetan people and patriotic people, and have fallen into shameful failure. Such an end is the best irony for that small group of Tibetan rebel elements who pretend to represent ethnic interests. (Enthusiastic applause)

    The Rebel Elements Still Try to Maintain Their Dark Rule
    The Tibetan People Hope to Carry Out Reforms and Improve Their Lives

The Party and the People's Government implement national regional autonomy in minority areas, enabling all minority ethnic groups to have the right to be masters of their own affairs for the first time in history, promoting the development of politics, economy, and culture in minority areas, and improving the people's lives, and thus have been unanimously supported by the broad masses of people. Gradually implementing national regional autonomy in Tibet is clearly stipulated in the Seventeen-Article Agreement and fully conforms to the wishes of the broad masses of the Tibetan people. I remember when the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established in 1956, I personally saw the joyous and excited scene of the Tibetan people, and I was deeply moved and sincerely congratulated the Tibetan people on their bright future. However, the former Tibetan local government and the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique completely disregarded the will of the Tibetan people, fundamentally opposed the implementation of national regional autonomy, and did everything possible to obstruct the preparatory work of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Their so-called "Tibetan autonomy" is actually "Tibetan independence," the purpose of which is to maintain their dark rule over the Tibetan people, restore the aggressive forces of imperialism in Tibet, preserve the feudal serf system, and separate Tibet from the embrace of the motherland. Obviously, this kind of "independence" is fundamentally different from national regional autonomy, which is under the premise of the unification of the motherland and under which the broad masses of the Tibetan people are the masters of their own affairs. This kind of "independence" only benefits imperialism and a very small number of reactionary elements, and brings only humiliation and suffering to the broad masses of the Tibetan people. This is of course intolerable to the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The failure of the Tibetan rebellion precisely shows that the rebel elements' so-called "independence" has long been completely bankrupt in the minds of the Tibetan people, and the national regional autonomy policy of the Party and the People's Government has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. (Applause)

    The Rebel Elements Undermine the Unity of the Han and Tibetan Nationalities Everywhere
    The Tibetan People Believe That Friendly Cooperation Between Han and Tibet is Very Important

The Tibetan rebel elements also clamor to "drive out the Han people" and slander the People's Liberation Army as "the army of the Han people" in an attempt to sow discord between the Han and Tibetan nationalities. However, this is ultimately futile. Since liberation, under the glorious light of the great national policy, the friendly and cooperative relationship between the Han and Tibetan nationalities has achieved unprecedented development. We, the Tibetan people, have deeply realized from our own personal experience that without the kind help of the Han elder brother, it is impossible to imagine that our Tibetan nationality would become an advanced nationality. Take our Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture as an example, the significant progress we have made in all aspects in recent years is inseparable from the help of Han cadres and the Han people. Facts have proven that what else can the rebel elements' clamoring achieve other than further exposing their true colors? As everyone knows, the People's Liberation Army is composed of outstanding children of all ethnic groups, including Han and other fraternal ethnic groups. I myself am the commander of the Gannan Military Sub-district. Our deputy commander, Comrade Yang Fuxing, is also Tibetan. Can this be said that the People's Liberation Army is "the army of the Han people"? (Enthusiastic applause) Furthermore, and more importantly, the People's Liberation Army guards the security of the motherland day and night, and protects the happy lives of the people of all ethnic groups. The people of all ethnic groups have always regarded the People's Liberation Army as their own army. With the People's Liberation Army, the people of all ethnic groups can live and work in peace and engage in production and construction without being subjected to imperialist aggression and sabotage by reactionary elements. Take the Tibetan rebellion as an example, if it were not for the devastating blow to the rebel elements by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa, it is unknown how much damage the lives and property of the Tibetan people would have suffered. Now it can be seen clearly that the reason why the Tibetan reactionary elements have consistently opposed the People's Liberation Army is precisely here. (Applause)

    The Rebel Elements Dream of Preserving the Serf System by Violence
    The Tibetan People are Determined to Embark on the Road of Prosperity and Happiness

The existing feudal serf system in Tibet is the darkest social system. It is the root cause of the backwardness of the Tibetan ethnic group and the suffering of the Tibetan people. Without reforming this system, the Tibetan people cannot be completely liberated, and the Tibetan ethnic group cannot move towards prosperity and progress. Since liberation, the broad masses of the Tibetan people have urgently demanded social reforms, and patriotic people in Tibet have also advocated reforming this unreasonable social system. Even so, the Central People's Government has still adopted a policy of patiently waiting for social reforms in Tibet, which is entirely to prioritize the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity, and has truly done its utmost. However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique not only refused to fulfill the provisions on social reform in the Seventeen-Article Agreement, but also intensified their efforts and openly launched an armed rebellion, attempting to preserve the feudal serf system and continue to oppress and enslave the Tibetan people. What was the result? It backfired and created favorable conditions for social reform in Tibet. After the Gannan Tibetan region abolished the exploitative system and feudal privileges in 1958, it quickly realized the people's commune system and leaped into socialism. I believe that this great change of ascending to the ninth heaven in one step will soon appear in Tibet as well. (Long and thunderous applause)

Yesterday, I read the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials in Tezpur, India, on April 18 and felt extremely angry. This statement is a complete distortion of the facts and a reversal of black and white. It is clearly something jointly fabricated by foreign aggressors and Tibetan rebel elements and is not the Dalai Lama's intention at all. Especially in terms of style and tone, it is completely unlike our Tibetan people and more like the work of some foreigners. Since the rebel elements abducted the Dalai Lama abroad, why can't they, under the instruction of foreign aggressors, steal the Dalai Lama's name and issue such and such statements? This is something that everyone can imagine. We cannot help but worry about the Dalai Lama's current situation and hope that he can get rid of the coercion of foreign aggressors and rebel elements as soon as possible and return to the warm family of the motherland. (Enthusiastic applause)

Let foreign aggressors and rebel elements clamor and cry, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, with the support of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and under the direct leadership of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni, and through the joint efforts of the broad masses of the Tibetan people and patriotic people, we will surely achieve a complete victory in quelling the rebellion, smoothly carry out social reforms, and implement national regional autonomy. The suffering life of the Tibetan people under the feudal serf system will come to an end forever, and the backward, dark, and cruel Tibet will become a thing of the past. A democratic and socialist new Tibet will soon appear on the land of the motherland! (Long and enthusiastic applause)

Finally, let me shout:
Long live the unity of the motherland and all ethnic groups! (Applause)
Long live the Chinese Communist Party! (Applause)
Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups! (Enthusiastic applause)

### 藏族同祖国血肉相连

专栏：

    藏族同祖国血肉相连
    黄正清代表说：西藏民族和西藏人民要求的是祖国的统一，不是祖国的分裂；是民族团结，不是民族分离；是光明幸福的大道，不是黑暗痛苦的深渊各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。作为一个藏族代表，我坚决拥护中央人民政府关于彻底平息西藏叛乱，并在西藏逐步进行社会改革和实行民族地方自治的方针。（鼓掌）
    叛乱分子想把西藏变成外国殖民地
    藏族人民要的是强大的统一的祖国
    西藏从来就是我们祖国的神圣领土。西藏民族，同各兄弟民族一样，对缔造我们的祖国有过贡献，并且在这个过程中，同各兄弟民族结成了血肉的关系。西藏民族是祖国大家庭的一员。只是由于帝国主义的侵略，西藏才发生了非爱国主义的倾向。而西藏的和平解放，又使西藏重新回到祖国的怀抱，实现了祖国的统一。这一切，都有历史事实可以查考，决不是任何人所能随便歪曲的。我们甘南藏族人民知道得尤其清楚。原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团，投靠帝国主义，勾结蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，发动武装叛乱，阴谋策划所谓“西藏独立”，这是彻头彻尾的叛国行为。中央人民政府为了维护祖国统一和民族团结，采取坚决措施平息西藏叛乱，完全是行使我国主权，完全是我国内政。外人无权过问。否则就是干涉我国内政，就是违反和平共处的五项原则，就是对我国不友好的举动。（热烈鼓掌）祖国的命运，同我们各民族的命运是休戚相关、血肉相连的。在我们祖国遭受帝国主义侵略和反动派统治的岁月里，各民族的遭遇都充满了悲惨、痛苦和血泪。而今天，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的强大和统一的祖国大家庭里，我们各民族都享受到温暖和幸福，走上了繁荣发展的道路。共同的理想，共同的目标，把各民族的命运更紧密地联结在一起了。祖国的统一，就是各民族共同的最高利益。对于曾经在帝国主义和反动派压迫下受尽苦难的各民族人民来说，难道还有比一个强大的统一的祖国更为可贵的吗？（鼓掌）离开了各民族的最高利益，就根本谈不到民族利益。原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团，为了掩盖自己的叛国罪行，装出一副代表西藏民族利益的样子。其实，这是无济于事的。西藏民族和西藏人民要求的是祖国的统一，不是祖国的分裂；是民族团结，不是民族分离；是忠实地履行关于和平解放西藏的十七条协议，不是撕毁这一协议；是光明幸福的大道，不是黑暗痛苦的深渊。而这些叛乱分子却是里通外国，破坏祖国统一，想把西藏变为外国的殖民地或者保护国，把西藏人民推向水深火热的境地。他们的所作所为，那里有一丝一毫代表着西藏民族的真正利益？背叛祖国，就是背叛本民族利益。人民的眼睛是雪亮的。叛乱分子的罪恶活动，遭到了全国各民族人民首先是西藏人民和爱国人士的坚决反对，而陷于可耻的失败。这样的下场，对于那一小撮伪装代表民族利益的西藏叛乱分子，真是最好不过的讽刺了。（热烈鼓掌）
    叛乱分子仍图维持他们的黑暗统治
    藏族人民希望进行改革和提高生活
    党和人民政府在少数民族地区实行民族地方自治，使各少数民族有史以来第一次获得了真正当家作主的权利，促进了各少数民族地区政治、经济、文化的发展和人民生活的提高，因而受到了广大人民的一致拥护。在西藏逐步实行民族地方自治，是十七条协议中明确规定的，也是完全符合西藏广大人民愿望的。记得一九五六年西藏自治区筹备委员会成立的时候，我亲眼看到西藏人民欢欣鼓舞的情景，深深受到感动，衷心为西藏人民美好的未来祝贺。但是，原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团，完全不愿西藏人民的意志，根本反对实行民族地方自治，百般阻挠西藏自治区筹备工作的进行。他们的所谓“西藏自治”，实际上就是“西藏独立”，目的是要维持他们对西藏人民的黑暗统治，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力，保存封建的农奴制度，使西藏脱离祖国的怀抱。显然，这种“独立”，同在祖国统一的前提下由西藏广大人民当家作主的民族地方自治，是根本不同的两回事。这种“独立”，除了对帝国主义和极少数反动分子有利以外，给西藏广大人民带来的，只能是屈辱和苦难。这当然是西藏人民和全国各民族人民断乎不能容忍的。西藏叛乱的失败，正是说明了叛乱分子的所谓“独立”在西藏人民心目中早已彻底破产，而党和人民政府的民族地方自治政策已经深入了人心。（鼓掌）
    叛乱分子处处破坏汉藏民族的团结
    藏族人民认为汉藏友爱合作很重要
    西藏叛乱分子还叫嚣“赶走汉人”，诬蔑人民解放军是“汉人的军队”，企图挑拨汉藏民族的关系。然而这毕竟是徒劳的。解放以来，在伟大的民族政策的光辉照耀下，汉藏民族的友爱合作关系获得了空前的发展。我们藏族人民，从自己的亲身经历中，深刻地体会到，如果没有汉族老大哥的亲切帮助，我们藏族要成为一个先进的民族，是不可能想象的。就拿我们甘南藏族自治州来说，几年来能够在各方面得到这样重大的进展，都是同汉族干部和汉族人民的帮助分不开的。事实证明，叛乱分子的叫嚣，除了更加暴露了他们的真面目以外，还能够得到什么呢？大家知道，人民解放军是各民族的优秀子弟组成的，其中，有汉族也有其他兄弟民族。我自己就是甘南军分区的司令员。我们的副司令员杨复兴同志，也是藏族。这难道可以说解放军是“汉人的军队”吗？（热烈鼓掌）再进一步说，更重要的是人民解放军日日夜夜地保卫着祖国的安全，保卫着各民族人民的幸福生活。各民族人民一向认为人民解放军是自己的军队。有了人民解放军各民族人民才能安居乐业，从事生产建设，而不至于受到帝国主义的侵略和反动分子的破坏。就拿这次西藏叛乱事件来说，如果不是人民解放军驻拉萨部队给了叛乱分子以毁灭性的打击，西藏人民的生命财产真不知道要受到多么重大的损失。现在可以看清楚，西藏的反动分子所以一贯敌视人民解放军，原因也正在这里。（鼓掌）
    叛乱分子幻想用暴力保存农奴制度
    藏族人民决心要走上繁荣幸福道路
    西藏现存的封建农奴制度，是一种最黑暗的社会制度。这是造成西藏民族落后和西藏人民苦难的根源。这种制度不改革，西藏人民就不可能得到彻底的翻身，西藏民族就不可能走向繁荣和进步。解放以来，西藏广大人民迫切要求进行社会改革，西藏的爱国人士也主张改革这种不合理的社会制度。虽然如此，中央人民政府对于西藏的社会改革，仍然采取耐心等待的方针，这完全是以祖国统一和民族团结为重，真是做到了仁至义尽的地步。但是，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，不但拒不履行十七条协议中有关社会改革的规定，而且变本加厉，公然发动武装叛乱，企图保存封建农奴制度，继续压迫和奴役西藏人民。结果呢？适得其反，恰好为西藏的社会改革排除了障碍，创造了有利的条件。我们甘南藏族地区，在1958年废除了剥削制度和封建特权以后，很快就实现了人民公社化，一跃而进入了社会主义。我相信，这种一步直登九重天的伟大变革，不久也将出现于西藏。（经久不息的掌声）
    昨天，我看了四月十八日在印度提斯浦尔由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，感到极大的愤怒。这个声明完全是歪曲事实颠倒黑白的捏造。它显然是外国侵略者和西藏叛乱分子共同制造出来的东西，而并非出于达赖喇嘛的本意。特别是从文体、语气上看，完全不像我们藏族的，倒像是某些外国人的手笔。叛乱分子既然把达赖喇嘛劫出了国外，何尝不可以在外国侵略者的授意下盗用达赖喇嘛的名义发表这样那样的声明。这是谁都能够想像得到的。我们不禁为达赖喇嘛当前的处境担忧，希望他能够早日摆脱外国侵略者和叛乱分子的挟持，回到温暖的祖国大家庭里来。（热烈鼓掌）
    让外国侵略者和叛乱分子去叫嚣和哭泣吧，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在人民解放军驻西藏部队的援助下，在全国各民族人民的支持下，在西藏自治区筹备委员会和班禅额尔德尼代理主任委员的直接领导下，经过西藏广大人民和爱国人士的共同努力，一定能够取得平息叛乱的彻底胜利，一定能够顺利进行社会改革和实行民族地方自治。西藏人民在封建的农奴制度下的苦难生活就要永远结束，落后、黑暗、残酷的西藏就要成为过去，在祖国土地上一定很快就会出现一个民主和社会主义的新西藏！（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    最后让我高呼：
    祖国统一和各民族团结万岁！（鼓掌）
    中国共产党万岁！（鼓掌）
    各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！（热烈鼓掌）
