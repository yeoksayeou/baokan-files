Baotou, a steel city under construction, is located in the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, facing the Yellow River and backing onto the Daqing and Wula Mountains, connecting to the Hetao in the west and adjacent to the Tumochuan in the east. It is a region rich in resources. It can draw grain and vegetables from the Hetao and Tumote plains to feed the people, exploit iron and coal mines in the Daqing and Wula Mountains, and draw water from the Yellow River as a long-term water source for the base, supplying the large blast furnaces. Baotou is 150 kilometers away from the Baiyun Obo iron ore mine, 35 kilometers away from the Shiguai coal mine, and only 300 kilometers away from the Zhuozishan coal mine and limestone mine. Other refractory materials and non-metallic mines are also nearby. Raw materials are close to the steel plant, and transportation is very convenient. At the same time, Baotou is the terminus of the Beijing-Baotou Railway, the starting point of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, and the Yellow River transportation can also be utilized. Transportation is convenient, making it a hub connecting North and Northwest China. Our country decided to build a steel industrial base in Baotou during the First Five-Year Plan. This is a very rational and brilliant measure, which will greatly change the unreasonable distribution of industry in our country and greatly encourage the Mongolian people and the people of all ethnic minorities in our country. In the future, the supply of large quantities of iron, steel, and the manufacturing and supply of mechanical equipment will greatly benefit the industrial development and agricultural and pastoral technical transformation of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Ningxia Autonomous Region, and the vast areas of Northwest and North China. Building the Baotou industrial base in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, building a large-scale iron and steel joint enterprise from scratch on the grassland, is a great move. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao dare we propose such an unprecedented plan and complete such a construction task that predecessors dared not think of and could not even imagine. This is a proof of the superiority of our socialist system, the strength of the close unity of the various ethnic groups in our country, the great strength of the unified motherland family, and the great strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    Major Construction Projects Achieve Great Progress - The Minority Workers Rapidly Grow
    Baotou, a steel city under construction, is rapidly growing stronger with the support of the people of the whole country, the all-out support of the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the assistance of the Soviet Union, and the nurturing of the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland. The construction of the Baotou industrial base takes Baogang as its center, including machinery manufacturing industry, electric power industry, various metal and non-metal mining, and so on. The First Five-Year Plan completed the preparation work for large-scale construction, gradually assembled the construction army, completed the construction of the construction base, and carried out the necessary welfare facilities and urban construction. In 1958, a great leap forward situation was launched. The amount of capital construction completed in that year was close to the total capital construction investment of the entire city during the First Five-Year Plan period, and the total industrial output value was 52 percent of the total during the First Five-Year Plan period. Major projects of Baogang, such as water sources, mines, coking plants, refractory plants, and No. 1 blast furnace, have made great progress. The state-owned large-scale machinery manufacturing plant has been basically completed and is preparing to produce machines and equipment in batches. Under the impetus of Baogang's construction, railways, electric power, coal, local industries, cultural education, and service undertakings have also developed greatly. With the development of the industrial base, the ranks of the working class are constantly growing stronger. From 10,000 at the time of liberation, it has now increased to 200,000. There are veteran workers, technical personnel, farmers, herdsmen, students, and soldiers here. No matter where they come from, everyone is being tempered in socialist construction, gradually improving their socialist consciousness, organization, and discipline, and overcoming the ideological style of the old society. It is particularly worth mentioning the training of ethnic minority workers. In 1953, there were a total of 300 ethnic minority workers. In 1958, incomplete statistics show that it had increased to nearly 5,000, including 1,500 Mongolian workers, and many model figures have emerged. From a herdsman to a worker, from mastering simple herding tools to mastering modern machines, this is a leap-forward change, which has profound significance for eliminating the de facto inequality between ethnic groups, for closely connecting the industrial base with agricultural and pastoral areas, and for the development of socialist ethnic relations.

    The Great Steel Smelting Movement in 1958 implemented the policy of "taking steel as the key link to drive everything else," which was a large-scale field exercise for the Baotou industrial base. The First Five-Year Plan completed the preparatory work for large-scale construction, and in 1958 a great leap forward situation was formed, which laid a reliable foundation for iron production this year.

    1959 is a decisive year for our country's three years of hard struggle. The construction of the Baotou industrial base, centered on Baogang, has entered a new period this year, that is, while completing huge capital construction, it is also necessary to produce a certain amount of iron, steel, and steel to contribute part of its strength to the country's great task of producing 18 million tons of steel this year.

    Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement - Work Hard and Build Frugally
    According to the national plan, the total investment in capital construction of the Baotou industrial base this year is about 140 percent of last year, and the total industrial output value is more than three times that of last year. In terms of capital construction, Baogang must complete twice the amount of work as last year, and more than 20 technically complex major projects must be completed and put into production. The iron ore mines, blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and coke ovens under construction must all produce some products this year. Power stations, coal, railways, and other construction projects that directly serve Baogang's production must also be partially or mostly completed and put into operation. Other necessary urban construction, local industries, cultural education, and service undertakings must also strive to keep up with the development of Baogang's production and construction.

    Premier Zhou called in the government work report: "We should mobilize the enthusiasm of every worker, farmer, intellectual, and every patriotic citizen ideologically and politically in every corner of the country and immediately launch a national movement to increase production and practice economy." We warmly respond to this call. We believe that in the construction of the Baotou industrial base, it is of particularly important significance to implement this spirit, because the construction of Baotou, especially the construction of Baogang, uses a lot of people, materials, equipment, and machinery, and these materials and equipment are transported from all over the country, and some are transported from abroad. In short, a piece of wood, a section of steel, and a bag of cement are all transported from thousands of miles away, and they are the fruits of the hard work of workers and farmers from all over the country, which are hard-won. Therefore, in the case of materials and equipment not adapting to the construction requirements, how to concentrate, rationally, effectively, and economically use materials, equipment, and machinery should become the requirement of technological innovation and technological revolution and should become the evaluation standard for carrying out socialist labor emulation. With the support of the whole country, we must resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs" and strive to achieve self-reliance to solve a part of the materials and equipment, oppose the dependent thinking of asking for everything from others, and at the same time, we must carry forward the fine tradition of revolutionary hard struggle, build Baogang frugally, build the Baotou industrial base frugally, and make frugal construction a practical action of every employee and become a social atmosphere to promote the rapid development of base construction.

    An Important Move in the Whole Country's Game of Chess - An Extraordinary Painting in the Newest and Most Beautiful Picture
    The construction of the Baotou industrial base, centered on Baogang, is an important move in the whole country's game of chess. The achievements made in the past few years are inseparable from the support and help of all parts of the country. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all brotherly regions. 1959 is a crucial year for Baogang's construction, but there are still difficulties in the lack of materials and equipment, which are not adapted to the construction requirements; there are difficulties in the lack of skilled workers, which are not adapted to the requirements of the blast furnace starting production. Also, the blast furnace trial smelting of Baiyun Obo's fluorine-containing iron ore has not been completed, which is a major technical hurdle for Baogang's blast furnace to start production. We earnestly hope that brotherly regions and veteran steel plants and machinery plants will give greater support to promote Baogang's blast furnace to produce ahead of schedule and promote the young Baotou industrial base to move forward by leaps and bounds.

    In addition, Baogang needs a large amount of coking coal and other industrial coal after production. The coking coal needed this year is taken as a temporary measure and transported from other places. The Zhuozishan coal mine and the Wuda coal mine in the western part of Inner Mongolia have rich coal reserves. Therefore, it is recommended that the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry consider building the Zhuozishan and Wuda coal mines as Baogang's coal base.

    We believe that with the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the support of the people of the whole country, with the help of the Soviet Union, and with the 200,000-strong socialist construction army with the consciousness and courage to build the Baotou industrial base, we will definitely be able to complete and exceed the tasks assigned by the state this year! Strive to produce iron, steel, and steel this year to repay the support of the whole country; welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    Now let us recall the history of Baotou. After the Qing Dynasty, then the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang rule, for three hundred years, from grasslands to the establishment of villages and towns, until the early days of liberation, there were only more than 90,000 people, including more than 10,000 workers (including handicrafts), nine factories, and more than 1,000 individual handicraft households. It was a distribution center for fur and grain. The Kuomintang shouted "Develop the Northwest, build the Northwest," but in fact, there were only a few more bureaucratic landlord reclamation companies and a few more fur and grain shops that exploited farmers and herdsmen. They only regarded Baotou as a stronghold for oppressing and exploiting the Mongolian and Han people. After liberation, after a period of restoring production, after the First Five-Year Plan, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, a total of eight years have passed, and there have been very huge changes here. Since the large-scale construction of industry began in 1957, a total of 4 million square meters of building area have been completed in the past few years. Now there are 416 industrial production enterprises in the city, of which 146 are larger enterprises. It is now an emerging socialist industrial city with a population of 800,000.

    This year, the construction of the Baotou industrial base has entered a new period. With the construction of Baogang as the center, capital construction and production are advancing by leaps and bounds. Baogang will leap from capital construction to partial production. In addition, machinery manufacturing plants, aluminum plants, cement, molding sand, refractory materials, chemical plants, cotton textile mills... etc. will also accelerate their completion and be partially or fully put into production. This year, the total industrial output value will exceed the total investment in capital construction. In two or three years, we will see a complete, modern, and large-scale Baogang joint enterprise, which will stand side by side with Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel... veteran iron and steel plants, forming the backbone system of my country's iron and steel industry; looking forward to the future, we are extremely excited.

    According to the planning of our country's great socialist construction blueprint, we are drawing a great picture on the grassland of Inner Mongolia, and we are carving a magnificent city. Her craftsmen and painters are conscious socialist builders from all over the country, that is, the 200,000 builders of the Baotou industrial base. This is indeed an extraordinary and beautiful picture, and this is indeed a magnificent and splendid carving. She is the steel city under construction - Baotou!

    包头——建设中的钢都
    苏谦益代表的发言
    包头——建设中的钢都，位于内蒙古自治区西部，面临黄河，背靠大青山、乌拉山，西连河套，东接土默川，是一个资源丰富的地区。它可以向河套和土默特平原取粮取菜，供养人们的吃喝，可以开辟大青山、乌拉山取铁矿、取煤矿，可以引黄河之水作为基地的长流水源，供养大高炉的吃喝。包头距白云鄂博铁矿山一百五十公里，距石拐煤矿三十五公里，距卓子山煤矿和石灰石矿也只不过三百公里，其他耐火材料等非金属矿山也都在附近，原料接近钢铁厂，运输很方便。同时，包头是京包铁路的终点，是包兰铁路的起点，黄河运输也可利用，交通方便，是联络华北和西北的枢纽。我国在第一个五年计划确定在包头建设钢铁工业基地，这是一个十分合理和英明的措施，这将大大改变我国工业分布不合理的状态，大大鼓舞了蒙族人民和我国各少数民族人民，将来大量的钢铁，钢材的供应，机械设备的制造供应，大大有利于内蒙古自治区、宁夏自治区以及整个西北、华北广大地区工业的发展和农牧业的技术改造。在内蒙古自治区建设包头工业基地，在草原上平地起家建设规模巨大的钢铁联合企业，这是一个伟大的举动，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，才敢提出这样史无前例的计划，才能完成这样前人不敢想而且也想不出来的建设任务。这是我国社会主义制度优越性的证明，这是我国各族人民亲密团结的力量，这是统一的祖国大家庭的伟大力量，也是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大力量。
    重大建设工程取得很大进展  少数民族工人队伍迅速成长
    包头——建设中的钢都，在全国人民的支援下，在内蒙古自治区各族人民全力以赴的支援下，在苏联的帮助下，在祖国各族人民的抚育下，正在迅速地成长壮大。包头工业基地的建设是以包钢为中心，包括有机械制造工业、电力工业、各种金属和非金属矿山采掘等等。第一个五年计划完成了大规模建设的准备工作，逐渐集结了建设大军，完成了建筑基地的建设，进行了必要的福利设施和城市建设。一九五八年展开了大跃进的局面，这一年完成的基本建设工作量接近第一个五年计划期间全市基本建设投资的总和，工业总产值为第一个五年计划期间总和的百分之五十二。包钢的重大工程项目如水源地、矿山、焦化厂、耐火厂、一号高炉等均取得很大进展；国营大型机械制造厂已经基本建成，正在准备成批生产机器和设备；在包钢建设的带动下，铁路、电力、煤炭、地方工业、文化教育和服务性事业也都有了很大的发展。随着工业基地建设的发展，工人阶级的队伍不断的成长壮大，由解放时的一万人现在已增加到二十万人了，这里有老工人、有技术人员、有农牧民、有学生、有军人，不管来自何方，大家都在社会主义建设中受到锻炼，逐渐提高社会主义的自觉性、组织性和纪律性，克服着旧社会的思想作风。特别值得提出的是少数民族职工的培养，一九五三年少数民族职工共有三百人，一九五八年不完全的统计已增加到近五千人，其中蒙族职工一千五百人，而且出现了不少的模范人物。由一个牧民变成工人，由掌握简单的牧畜工具到掌握现代化的机器，这是一个飞跃式的大变化，这对于消灭民族之间事实上的不平等，对于密切工业基地与农牧区的关系，对于社会主义民族关系的发展有深远的意义。
    一九五八年的大炼钢铁运动，贯彻了“以钢为纲”带动一切的方针，对包头工业基地来说是进行了一次大规模的实地演习。第一个五年计划完成了大规模建设的准备工作，一九五八年形成了大跃进的局面，这就为今年出铁打下了可靠的基础。
    一九五九年是我国苦战三年具有决定性的一年，以包钢为中心的包头工业基地的建设今年已经进入了一个新的时期，这就是要在完成巨大的基本建设的同时，还要生产出一定数量的铁钢和钢材，为国家今年生产一千八百万吨钢的伟大任务中贡献出一部分力量。
    开展增产节约运动  艰苦奋斗勤俭建设
    根据国家计划，今年包头工业基地的基本建设总投资约为去年的百分之一百四十，工业总产值相当于去年的三倍以上。包钢在基本建设方面要完成相当于去年两倍的工作量，二十多个技术复杂的重大项目要建成投入生产，正在兴建的铁矿山、高炉、平炉、焦炉都要在今年生产一部分产品；直接为包钢生产服务的电站、煤炭、铁路等建设项目也要部分或大部建成发挥作用；其他必要的城市建设、地方工业、文教卫生、以及服务事业等也要随着包钢生产建设的发展努力跟上去。
    周总理在政府工作报告中号召“我们应当在全国的每一个角落，从思想上政治上动员每一个工人、农民、知识分子和每一个爱国的公民的积极性，立即开展一个增产节约的全民运动”。我们热烈响应这一号召，我们认为在包头工业基地的建设中，贯彻这一精神有特殊重要的意义，因为包头的建设尤其是包钢的建设用的人很多，用的材料设备机具很多，而且这些材料、设备又是从全国各地运来，有些还是从国外运来的，总之是一根木材、一段钢材、一袋水泥都是千里以外调来，是各地工人、农民辛勤劳动的果实，来之不易，因此，在材料设备不适应施工要求的情况下，如何集中、合理、有效、节约地使用材料、设备和机具，应成为技术革新和技术革命的要求，应当成为开展社会主义劳动竞赛的评比标准。在全国支援下，我们必须坚决贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，力求自力更生解决一部分材料、设备，反对万事求人的依赖思想，同时必须发扬革命的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，勤俭建设包钢，勤俭建设包头工业基地，要把勤俭建设成为每个职工的实际行动，成为社会风气，以促进基地建设迅速发展。
    全国一盘棋中重要的一着  最新最美的画图中非凡的一幅
    以包钢为中心的包头工业基地的建设，是全国一盘棋中的重要一着。过去几年来所取得的成绩，是和全国各地的支援、帮助分不开的，仅向各兄弟地区致以诚恳的谢意。一九五九年是包钢的建设处在紧要关头的一年，但是仍然存在材料设备缺乏的困难，不适应施工的要求；存在技术工人缺乏的困难，不适应大高炉开工生产的要求。还有白云鄂博含氟铁矿石的高炉试冶炼的工作没有完成，这是包钢大高炉开工生产在技术上的一个大关。以上这些问题殷切盼望各兄弟地区和各老大哥钢铁厂和机械厂给予更大的支援，以促进包钢大高炉提前生产，促进幼年的包头工业基地大踏步的前进。
    此外，包钢生产以后需要大量的炼焦煤和其他方面的工业用煤，今年需要的焦煤是采取临时措施，从外地调运。内蒙古西部地区的卓子山煤矿和乌达煤矿有丰富的煤藏量，因此建议煤炭部和冶金部考虑建设卓子山和乌达煤矿作为包钢的煤炭基地。
    我们相信，有党中央和毛主席的领导，有全国人民的支援，有苏联的帮助，有二十万具有建设包头工业基地自觉性和勇气的社会主义建设大军，我们一定能够完成和超过今年国家交给的任务！力争今年出铁，出钢，出钢材，报答全国的支援；迎接建国十周年国庆。
    现在让我们回忆一下包头的历史，经过清代皇朝，而后北洋军阀，国民党统治时期，三百年来从草原到建立村落、市镇，直到解放初期，只有九万多人口，其中工人（包括手工业）一万多人，有九个工厂，另有个体手工业一千余户，是一个皮毛、粮食的集散点，国民党高喊的“开发西北，建设西北”，其实只是多了几个官僚地主的屯垦公司，多了几个剥削农民牧民的皮毛粮店，他们只是把包头作为一个压迫剥削蒙汉人民的据点。解放后经过恢复生产的时期，经过第一个五年计划，特别是经过一九五八年的大跃进，总共八年的时光，这里已经发生了十分巨大的变化。从一九五七年开始工业大规模建设以来，几年来总共已经完成四百万平方公尺的建筑面积，现在全市共有工业生产企业四百一十六个，其中较大的企业是一百四十六个，这里现在已是一个拥有八十万人口的新兴的社会主义工业城市了。
    今年包头工业基地的建设进入新的时期，以包钢的建设为中心，基本建设和生产双双跃进，包钢将由基本建设跃进到局部生产，此外机械制造厂、铝厂、水泥、型砂、耐火、化工厂、棉纺厂……等也要加速建成并部分或全部投入生产，今年全部工业总产值要超过全部基本建设的总投资数。两三年以后，就要看到一个完整的、现代化的、规模巨大的包钢联合企业，将同鞍钢、武钢……老大哥钢铁厂并驾齐驱，形成我国钢铁工业的骨干体系；瞻望将来，无比兴奋。
    按照我国伟大的社会主义建设总图的规划，我们正在内蒙古的草原上划一幅伟大的图画，正在雕刻一座雄伟的城市，她的工匠和画师就是来自全国各地的、自觉的社会主义建设者，就是二十万包头工业基地的建设者，这确实是一张非凡的美丽的图画，这确实是一座堂皇富丽的雕刻，她就是建设中的钢都——包头！
