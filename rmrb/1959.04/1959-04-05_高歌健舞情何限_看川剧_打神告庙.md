How boundless are the soaring songs and vigorous dances
　　——Watching the Sichuan Opera "Beating the Gods and Making Accusations"
　　Ouyang Yuqian
　　The scholar Wang Kui was down on his luck in Jining, impoverished and ill, and on the verge of death, when he was rescued by the singing girl Jiao Guiying. They fell in love and married. Guiying gave him meticulous care, allowing him to study in peace and finding ways to support him in going to Beijing to take the imperial examination. As they parted, Wang Kui was filled with gratitude and reluctance. He said that without Guiying, he would have long gone to the underworld. She was a great benefactor, whom he would treat as a mother and teacher, and would always remember in his heart. They went together to the Sea God Temple to swear an oath: the man would not remarry, and the woman would not marry again. After Wang Kui left, Guiying's mother forced her to marry a rich and powerful Jin member, but she kept her oath, day and night hoping for Wang Kui to return. Finally, she received a letter, along with two hundred taels of silver. It turned out that Wang Kui had become a top scholar after going to Beijing and had married a daughter of a high-ranking official. Two hundred taels of silver and a letter were all it took to divorce Guiying. Guiying wanted to sue him for marrying again while still married to her, but knowing that the government would not accept her complaint, she had no choice but to wear paper money on her head and hold a handful of incense, going to the Sea God Temple to accuse the bodhisattva. She said that the common people were easy to deceive, but heaven's principles could not be violated, and she hoped that the bodhisattva could uphold justice. But the clay and wooden bodhisattva could not help her, and in despair, she hanged herself. Her spirit rushed to Beijing and captured Wang Kui alive.
　　This play is said to have existed in the Southern Drama of the Song Dynasty, and there was a version written by Wang Yufeng in the Ming Dynasty. This is a preserved program of Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang. I had seen "Love Trial" in the past, which is the scene of the live capture, but this time, with the Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Troupe coming to Beijing, I was able to see Comrade Hu Shufang's performance of "Beating the Gods and Making Accusations," which is the "Yang Accusation" excerpt. This is a brilliant performance.
　　The play opens with the Sea God wearing a crown and holding a jade tablet, sitting upright in the shrine. On the left is a little ghost, and on the right is a yamen runner, each holding a bamboo clapper, with a cloth covering their heads, looking like paper figures. The audience thought they were just clothes on wooden frames. Jiao Guiying has paper money hanging on her head, with her hair disheveled, wearing a black pleated dress, holding a handful of incense in her right hand, with her trouser legs tied up and not wearing a skirt. She walks towards the temple like a lost soul, shouting as soon as she enters: "Wang Kui, you thief!" This dress gives people a strong impression—it is said that in the past, people who had suffered injustice often wore paper money on their heads and held incense, shouting about their grievances on the streets. This was a custom in Sichuan—the painful cry bursts forth from her beautiful, strong, and slightly trembling lips. Her eyes are still so bright and melancholy, and full of anger. She recites, sings, and walks. Her voice is very clear, her movements are agile, and her actions are concise and accurate. Every time she turns, she strikes a pose, but not excessively. The thread of emotion runs through the whole performance. It is evident that the actor has a solid foundation and has put a lot of effort into shaping the character in this play. Next to me, an expert said: "This actor has a lot of skill. I heard that she learned from Zhou Mulian." I could also see that she had a clear lineage. She shouts: "Wang Kui, robber, I'm going to sue you!" Then she walks into the temple and kneels before the bodhisattva, making a series of accusations. A humble singing girl, bullied by a nobleman, can only accept her fate in feudal society, and even the bodhisattva cannot uphold justice for her. She asks the Sea God: "Are you deaf? Are you mute?..." She picks up the candlestick and hits the Sea God. After this, she begs the little ghost, calling: "Clapper brother, clapper brother!" She is truly helpless. The clapper ghost does not answer, so she pushes the clapper ghost down, and she herself faints. The pushed-down clapper ghost gets up and sings: "...Little Wang Kui doesn't recognize you, bringing bad luck to my bodhisattva. It's better to go meet him, don't show off your power here." Guiying wakes up, vaguely seeing her mother forcing her to marry again. She turns around and sees the yamen runner, thinking that Wang Kui has returned, and seems to have a glimmer of hope. Suddenly, she remembers the decisive letter, and filled with grief and anger, she knocks down the yamen runner as well, and she herself faints again. The yamen runner dances and sings: "This woman is doing something wrong, you vent your anger, and I suffer. Who doesn't know that I am a little ghost, and you treat me as Wang Kui. This time I'm beaten to pieces, leaving only a pile of straw." Comrade Wang Chaowen mentioned the clapper and yamen runner in "Beating the Gods" in his article "Life is Not Just Art," believing that the lyrics of these two ghosts are Jiao Guiying's inner monologue. I think it can be explained this way. Such treatment is a characteristic of Sichuan Opera, and such insertions were common in Song and Yuan Southern Dramas.
　　Guiying wakes up again, and because of her overwhelming emotions, she is extremely tired. She leans against the altar, closes her eyes, and thinks blankly. Suddenly, she hears the sound of geese calling in the sky. She concentrates on listening. The sound of the geese is sometimes near and sometimes far, and the night watchman's drum beats frequently. This piece of music is very beautiful, and the performance is very moving. She struggles to stand up. In the deep night, she is alone in the ancient temple, thinking about the past and the future, with nowhere to turn. She slowly unties her belt, repeatedly stroking it in her hands. She sings: "...To whom can I reveal my suffering as a woman? I can only become a ghost! Wang Kui, you robber! As a ghost, I will find you to clarify right and wrong!" She commits suicide.
　　This play is performed in layers from beginning to end. When Guiying first enters the temple, she may still have some illusions, and after venting her anger, she may still think of some ideas to relieve her distress. By the time she hits the Sea God and pushes down the little ghost, her grief and anger have reached their peak. Here comes a turning point. She wakes up and leans against the altar, staying quiet for a while. This is like a sudden rain passing, and before the next one comes, there is such a brief period of calm. She hears the sound of geese, feels incomparable loneliness, and feels that there is no place in the world to settle down, except for death. She unties the silk belt around her waist, repeatedly playing with it, expressing endless melancholy and lingering feelings. Then she shouts, "Even as a ghost, I will clarify right and wrong with Wang Kui!"
　　As an audience member, I got the above impressions. Hu Shufang's portrayal of Jiao Guiying is successful. Her abundant emotions, loud singing voice, and skilled technique are all recognized. After watching the play, on the way home, I thought of a quatrain:
　　Faithless Wang Kui torments Guiying.
　　Beating the Gods and making accusations is no ordinary thing!
　　How boundless are the soaring songs and vigorous dances,
　　Thousands hold their breath to watch Shufang!
　　However, I would like to offer a few small opinions at the end: It is inappropriate to offer opinions casually about an actor you have never met before, having only seen one play of theirs, and seeing that play for the first time. But as an audience member, my feelings can still be expressed. An actor on stage has a dual personality. He must delve into the role, transforming himself from the inside out into the character in the play, but he should not blend his own emotions with the emotions of the character. Therefore, even if he is performing stormy emotions, he should still fully control himself. His heart should be very hot and very calm, which is also a unity of contradictions. If the character being performed is very excited, and the actor also becomes excited, then he will be more or less prone to tension. Secondly, beating the gods is a very tense scene, and it is natural for the tempo of the singing and dancing to speed up. I am completely ignorant of Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang. I personally feel that the drumbeat seemed to be pushed a little too fast in the two singing sections for the clapper and the yamen runner. A humble woman, suffering from bullying, with no one to tell in the vast sea of people, has no choice but to ask the gods to uphold justice. The great gods ignore her, so she has to complain to the little ghosts. What a sharp satire this is on the social system of the time! Guiying is filled with grief and indignation, yet her heart is full of tender feelings. Could these singing and performances be handled with slightly more rhythmic variation? Also, how exactly the sound of the geese should be expressed can also be studied. Using a large suona to represent the sound of geese seems a bit off. The incense held by Guiying should be long incense sticks with incense rods, and thin incense sticks are not suitable. These are all personal opinions, and may be used for reference.

    高歌健舞情何限
    ——看川剧“打神告庙”
  　欧阳予倩
    秀才王魁落魄济宁，贫病交加几濒于死，幸得歌女焦桂英拯救，彼此相爱结为夫妇。桂英给了他无微不至的照顾，使他能安心求学，又设法资助他上京赶考。临别的时候，王魁感恩戴德依依不舍，他说没有桂英早已走上黄泉路，她是大恩人，他要把她当母亲当先生看待，永远把她记在心上。二人同到海神庙去盟誓：男不重婚，女不再嫁。王魁走后，桂英的母亲逼她嫁给一个有钱有势的金员外，她坚守着誓约，日日夜夜盼王魁回来。好容易盼到了一封信，外带二百银子，原来王魁进京之后得中状元，另娶了一位相府的千金小姐，二百银子一封信就把桂英休了。桂英想去告他停妻再娶，明知官府不会准她的状子，无可如何，只好头顶纸钱，手举一把香，去到海神庙向菩萨控诉，她说，下民易欺，天理难容，希望菩萨能主持公道。可是泥塑木雕的菩萨也不能替她作主，绝望之余自缢而死。她的魂灵赶到京城，活捉了王魁。
    这个戏据说在宋朝的南戏里就有了，明朝有王玉峰写的本子，这是川剧高腔的保留节目。过去我看过“情探”，也就是活捉一场，这次四川省川剧演出团来到北京，我才得见胡漱芳同志所演的“打神告庙”，也就是“阳告”一折。这是一场精采的表演。
    一开场海神冠带秉笏端坐在神龛里。左边一个小鬼右边一个皂隶，每人拄着一根竹板子，布衫蒙头，看上去像个纸扎的，观众都以为只是木架子架着衣服。焦桂英头上挂着纸钱，垂着甩发，身上穿的是黑褶子，右手拿着一把香，底下扎着裤脚不穿裙子。她丧魂失魄般走向庙里，一上场就叫道：“王魁，贼呀！”她的这种打扮，给人以强烈的印象——据说过去遭了冤屈的人，往往头顶纸钱，手举香火，沿街呼冤，四川就有这样的风俗——惨痛的呼声从她那美丽、坚强、微带颤动的唇边喷放出来。她的眼神还是那么明秀而忧郁，又充满着愤怒。她念着、唱着、走着，她的嗓音很脆亮，身段很灵活，动作简练而准确。每逢转折之处，回身亮相，并不过火，感情的贯串始终不断。看得出演员很有基本功夫，而对这个戏中人物的塑造，是费过一番苦心的。在我旁边有一位内行说：“这个演员身上很有功夫。听说她是跟周慕莲学的。”我也看出她确有师承。她叫道：“王魁，强盗，我要去告你呀！”接着就走进庙去跪在菩萨面前，向菩萨作了一连串的控诉。一个卑贱的歌女，受了贵人的欺侮，在封建社会里只能认命，就是菩萨也不能为她主持公道。她问海神：“你聋了？你哑了？……”她拿起蜡烛台来打海神。这之后，她又去恳求小鬼，叫着：“排子哥呀，排子哥！”她真是无可奈何。排子鬼也没有回答，她顺手把排子鬼推倒，自己也昏倒过去。被推倒的排子鬼起来唱道：“……小王魁他不认你，带得我菩萨倒霉，倒不如去把他会，不要在这里发威。”桂英苏醒过来，恍惚见她妈妈来逼她另嫁；转身见皂隶，当作王魁回来了，似乎又有了一线希望；忽然又想起决绝的书信，悲恨填膺，将皂隶也打倒，她自己又昏过去。皂隶鬼跳着唱道：“这妇人做事不对，你发气我就吃亏。谁不知我是小鬼，你把我当作王魁。这一下浑身打碎，只剩下一个草堆。”王朝闻同志在他所写“生活不就是艺术”一文里曾提到“打神”里的排子和皂隶，认为这两个鬼的唱词就是焦桂英的内心独白。我想可以这样解释。这样的处理在川戏里是个特点，宋元南戏里就经常有这种穿插。
    桂英再度苏醒过来，由于感情过于激动，她疲乏极了，靠在神案下，闭上眼睛呆呆的想着。忽然听见天边有雁叫声。她凝神谛听，雁声忽远忽近，更鼓频传。这一段音乐很美，表演十分动人。她扎挣着站起来，夜深古庙，孤独一人，思前想后，走投无路。她慢慢地解下腰带，在手里反复理着。她唱道：“……我女儿身冤苦剖向谁？我只有将身作鬼！王魁，强盗！我作鬼，要找你辨明是非！”她自杀了。
    这场戏从头到尾演得颇有层次，当桂英刚进庙的时候，她可能还存着若干幻想，发泄一顿之后可能还会想出甚么主意解除苦恼。及至打了海神，推倒小鬼，她悲恨的感情激动到了顶点。在这里来了一个转折，她醒过来靠着神案静了一会。这好比一阵骤雨过去，下一阵还没来，有这么一个短暂间歇的平静。她听到雁声，感到无比的孤独，感得天底下再没有甚么地方可以安顿自己，只有一死。她解下腰间罗带，反复弄着，表达无限幽恨缠绵之意。然后高叫“作鬼也要和王魁辨明是非！”
    作为一个观众，我得了以上的印象。胡漱芳对焦桂英这个人物的塑造是成功的。感情充沛，歌声嘹亮，技术熟练，都是公认的。看完戏在回家的路上想了一首绝句：
    负义王魁苦桂娘。
    打神告庙岂寻常！
    高歌健舞情何限，
    屏息千人看漱芳！
    但是，也有一点小意见想在后面谈一下：对一个从来没有见过面的演员，只看过他一个戏，这个戏又是头一次看，随便提意见是不适当的；但作为一个观众的感想也还是可以的。演员上了台是双重人格，他要深入角色，把自己从内心到外形化身成为剧中人，但又不宜把自己的感情和角色的感情融合在一起，所以他即使是表演暴风雨般的感情，还是应该充分控制自己，他的心应当是很热又很冷静，这也是矛盾的统一。如果所表演的角色很激动，演员也跟着激动，那就或多或少容易紧张。其次，打神是非常紧张的场面，歌舞的节拍加紧也是当然的，我对川剧高腔完全是外行，我个人觉得对排子、对皂隶的两段唱工，鼓板似乎催得稍微紧了一点。一个卑弱的女子，遭了欺侮，在茫茫人海之中，无可告诉，只得求神来主持公道，大神不理，只好向小鬼诉苦，这对当时的社会制度是多么尖锐的讽刺！桂英悲愤填膺而又柔肠百折，这几段的唱工和表演，是不是可以处理得略多一点节奏变化？还有，就是雁声究竟怎样来表现，也可以研究一下，用大唢呐表示雁声似乎差一点。桂英手里拿的香，应当是有香棒的长香，细的线香不适宜。这些都是个人的看法，或者可供参考。
