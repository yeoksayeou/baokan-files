Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: Washington Dispatch: While American news agencies are promoting the so-called "strategic silence policy" adopted by the U.S. government on the Tibetan situation, a large amount of news shows that American bourgeois newspapers and politicians are echoing Indian expansionists, attempting to launch a movement hostile to China.

After Indian foreign officials distributed the first so-called Dalai Lama statement, the U.S. ruling clique, like those who used the Dalai Lama's name to publish this statement, thought they had succeeded. On the 18th, State Department experts were so carried away that they regarded the publication of this flawed and clumsy statement as "a historic failure of communism in Asia." State Department spokesman Rhip also insisted at a press conference on the 20th that the statement "confirmed the atrocities of the Chinese Communists in Tibet." In fact, the lie-filled statement only exposed the tricks of the conspirators who planned its publication.

U.S. politicians are desperately using the quelling of the Tibetan rebellion in China, a purely internal affair, to provoke discord between Asian countries and China, attempting to incite them against China, so as to facilitate U.S. imperialism's entry into these countries to achieve its ulterior motives of controlling and enslaving them. This conspiracy is evident in the speeches made by former U.S. Ambassador to India Bowles and Congressman Emanuel Celler on a television program on the 19th. In their speeches, they fabricated and slandered China, falsely claiming that neutral countries in the region had tasted the "flavor of Chinese colonialism" for the first time. They unanimously believed that Nehru "is striving to oppose communism." Bowles also said that "India is a key country in keeping the vast area between Japan and Casablanca from being 'controlled' by the Communists," so they unanimously emphasized the need to increase "aid" to India to make it a "leader in Asia."

Some American newspapers greatly appreciate the recent frantic clamor against China by many right-wing Indian newspapers. The "Washington Post," which is close to the State Department, praised this clamor as "outspoken" in its editorial on the 15th. The newspaper also demanded that the U.S. ruling clique should be consistent with Asian "non-Communist countries" on the Tibetan rebellion and jointly express "private and official anger" at China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. The "Oakland Tribune" even openly incited Indian Prime Minister Nehru to "pluck up the courage" to grant the Dalai Lama not only so-called "religious asylum" but also so-called "political asylum." That is to say, to let the Tibetan traitorous bandits freely use the Dalai Lama's name to further collude with Indian expansionists and carry out anti-China activities on Indian territory.

At the same time, news shows that the United States is also attempting to kidnap the Dalai Lama to the United States when necessary, in order to further incite a movement hostile to China. According to the "New York Post" on the 16th in an article entitled "Washington Inside Story," the United States is plotting to bring the Tibetan issue to the United Nations and have the Dalai Lama personally make an "appeal" to the United Nations. The newspaper said that U.S. Secretary of State Herter (then Acting Secretary of State) had stated that "whenever the Dalai Lama is willing to come to the United States, he will be welcomed." The article said that Indian leaders had privately indicated that "he does not intend to dissuade the Dalai Lama from flying to the United States for this purpose."

According to the Indian Press Trust, usually reliable sources said that on the 19th, when the Dalai Lama passed through Tezpur, someone handed him two "sealed letters" from U.S. President Eisenhower. A news item from Georgia, USA, published in the "Times of India" on the 22nd, confirmed this. The news said that the U.S. President's vacation headquarters had admitted on the 21st that Eisenhower had sent such secret letters to India to be handed to the Dalai Lama.

    兴反华之风　作反共之浪
    美国统治集团和印度扩张分子相呼应
    印度官员散发所谓达赖声明　美国官员叫好
    印度报纸发出诽谤我国叫嚣　美国报纸打气
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国通讯社一方面宣传美国官方在西藏局势问题上采取所谓“战略性的沉默政策”，另一方面，却有大量消息表明，美国资产阶级报刊和政客们同印度的扩张主义分子相呼应，正在企图掀起一个敌视中国的运动。
    印度外交官员散发第一个所谓达赖喇嘛声明后，美国统治集团也像盗用达赖喇嘛名义发表这个声明的人一样以为得计，国务院的专家们在18日竟然得意忘形地把这个漏洞百出的拙劣声明的发表看做是“共产主义在亚洲的一次历史性失败”。美国国务院发言人里普20日在记者招待会上也硬说这个声明
  “证实了中国共产党人在西藏的暴行”。而事实却是，这个谎话连篇的声明徒然暴露了策划发表这个声明的阴谋分子的诡计。
    美国的政客们拼命利用中国平定西藏叛乱这件纯属中国内政的事情，极力挑拨离间亚洲国家同中国的友好关系，妄图煽动它们反对中国，以便利美帝国主义乘虚直入，达到它控制和奴役这些国家的不可告人的目的。这种阴谋从前美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯和众议员伊曼纽尔·塞勒在19日的电视节目中发表的讲话中看得十分清楚。他们在讲话中无中生有地诽谤中国，胡说什么这个地区的中立国家第一次尝到了“中国殖民主义的味道”。他们一致认为尼赫鲁“是亟力反共的”。鲍尔斯还说，“印度是保持日本和卡萨布兰卡之间广大地区不受共产党‘控制’的一个关键性的国家”，因此他们一致强调有必要增加对印度的“援助”，使它成为“亚洲的领导者”。
    一些美国报纸对许多印度右派报纸最近发表敌视中国的疯狂叫嚣极为欣赏。接近国务院的“华盛顿邮报”在15日的社论中把这种叫嚣称誉为“直言不讳”。这家报纸还要求美国的统治集团在西藏叛乱事件上应当同亚洲“非共产党国家”保持一致，共同对中国镇压西藏叛乱的行动表示“私人的和官方的愤怒”。“奥克兰论坛报”竟公开鼓动印度总理尼赫鲁“鼓起勇气”，不仅给达赖喇嘛以所谓“宗教避难权”，而且也给以所谓“政治避难权”。这就是说，要让西藏叛国匪徒放手地盗用达赖喇嘛的名义更进一步同印度扩张主义分子勾结起来，在印度领土上进行反对中国的活动。
    与此同时，消息显示，美国还企图在必要时把达赖喇嘛劫持到美国，以便进一步煽动敌视中国的运动。据“纽约邮报”16日在一篇题为“华盛顿的内幕”的文章中透露，美国正阴谋把西藏事件提到联合国并要达赖喇嘛亲自到联合国发表“呼吁”。这家报纸说，美国国务卿赫脱（当时是代理国务卿）曾经表示，“不管达赖喇嘛什么时候愿意到美国来，他都会受到欢迎”。文章说，印度的领导人曾私下表示过，“他不打算劝阻达赖喇嘛不要为此目的飞赴美国”。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，通常可靠的人士说，19日当达赖喇嘛经过提斯浦尔时，有人把美国总统艾森豪威尔的两封“密封信件”交给他。据“印度时报”22日刊载的来自美国佐治亚州的一条消息证实了这件事。这条消息说，美国总统休假总部在21日已经承认，艾森豪威尔曾经把这种密信送到印度交给达赖喇嘛。
