    The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni

    In Tibet, religious leaders are also political leaders. According to the historical traditions of the Tibetan local government, there are two political and religious leaders, namely the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni. Dalai is the Mongolian word for "ocean," meaning that his wisdom is as vast as the ocean. The title of Dalai Lama originated with the Third Dalai Lama. In 1575 (the 3rd year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty), the Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso, went to Qinghai to propagate Buddhism at the invitation of Anda Khan, a Mongolian chieftain of Qinghai, and was revered as the Dalai Lama.

    However, the official title of "Dalai Lama" was conferred by the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. Panchen is a Sanskrit word meaning "profound and vast wisdom and knowledge," and Erdeni is a term of respect. In 1717 (the 56th year of the Kangxi reign), the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty first conferred the title of "Panchen Erdeni." The Dalai resides in Lhasa, and the Panchen resides in Tashilhunpo.

    According to Tibetan records, the first incarnations of both the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama were chief disciples of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. After Tsongkhapa's death, his mantle was passed down through the reincarnations of these two disciples. Subsequently, whenever a Dalai Lama or Panchen Lama passed away, people were sent out to search for a "reincarnated" "living child" as their successor.

    The current Dalai Lama is the Fourteenth; the Panchen Erdeni is the Tenth.

    Lama
    After Buddhism was introduced into Tibet (7th century AD), it became mixed with strong primitive religious elements, so it is generally called Lamaism to distinguish it from general Buddhism. According to Lamaist teachings, Lama means "supreme" and "sage." Ordinary monks are also called Lama, which is a term of respect for monks.

    Living Buddha
    Living Buddhas are the upper class of lamas. Since the integration of politics and religion, Living Buddhas have always been the political leaders of Tibet. After the rise of the Gelug school, lamas were forbidden to marry, and the inheritance of the mantle was changed from father to son to a "reincarnation" system. Living Buddhas are divided into the following levels:

    1. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, who are the highest in status among Living Buddhas and are the political and religious leaders of Tibet.

    2. "Gyabo Zhugu" are the great Living Buddhas second only to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. "Gyabo" means king, and "Zhugu" means reincarnation. There are only four or five of these Living Buddhas. They were conferred the title "Hutuktu" by the Qing Dynasty government and are commonly known as Living Buddhas.

    3. Ordinary Living Buddhas, whose numbers are large. Some of these Living Buddhas are large landowners in Tibet, and most of them engage in commercial activities using temples, controlling the economic power of a region. They have great power within their own areas.

    Some are small Living Buddhas, and they also have their own small temples and estates.

    Khenpo
    Khenpo has the following meanings: 1. A lama who is deeply versed in the scriptures and masters the precepts; 2. The abbot of a lama temple; 3. The title of senior attendant monk officials of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and other great Living Buddhas.

    读报常识
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼
    西藏的宗教首领同时就是政治领袖，按照西藏地方历史传统，有两个政治宗教领袖，即达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼。达赖是蒙古语大海的意思，说他的智慧像海洋一样辽阔；达赖喇嘛的称号始自三世达赖。1575年（明万历3年），三世达赖琐南嘉错应青海蒙古酋长俺答汗的邀请，到青海传法以后，被尊称为达赖喇嘛。
    但“达赖喇嘛”的正式封号，是清朝顺治皇帝封的。班禅是梵文智慧学识深博广大的意思，额尔德尼是一种尊称。1717（康熙56）年，清朝康熙皇帝始封“班禅额尔德尼”称号。达赖驻拉萨，班禅驻札什伦布。
    根据西藏的记载，达赖和班禅的第一世都是黄教始祖宗喀巴的大弟子，宗喀巴圆寂（逝世）后，由达赖和班禅两个弟子转世继承衣钵。此后，每逢达赖或班禅圆寂，便派人四出寻找“转生”的“灵童”，作为继承者。
    现在的达赖喇嘛是第十四世；班禅额尔德尼是第十世。
    喇嘛
    佛教传入西藏（公元七世纪）以后，掺杂了浓厚的原始宗教成份，为了区别于一般的佛教，故通称喇嘛教。据喇嘛教义，喇嘛是“至高无上”、“圣人”的意思，一般僧侣也叫喇嘛，是对僧侣的尊称。
    活佛
    活佛是喇嘛中的上层。自从政教合一以后，活佛一直成为西藏政治上的首脑。黄教兴起以后，禁止喇嘛娶妻，衣钵继承由父子相承改变为“转世”制度。活佛又分下面几个等级：
    一、达赖和班禅，他们是活佛中地位最高的，是西藏的政教领袖。
    二、“甲波朱古”，是仅次于达赖和班禅的大活佛。“甲波”意为王，“朱古”意为转世。这等活佛只有四、五名。他们被清朝政府册封为“呼图克图”这一封号，俗称活佛。
    三、一般活佛，即普通活佛，数目很大，这些活佛中有些是西藏的大地主，同时他们大半都利用寺院从事商业活动，掌握一个地方的经济大权。他们在自己的区域内，有很大的权力。
    有些是小活佛，他们也有自己的小寺院和庄园。
    堪布
    堪布有以下几个意义：一、深通经典，掌握教律的喇嘛；二、喇嘛寺的主持人；三、达赖、班禅和其他大活佛的高级侍从僧官名称。
