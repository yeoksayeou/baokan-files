Comrades Delegates:

    I fully support the reports of Premier Zhou and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, as well as the work report of Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I will briefly discuss the work of our Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory in 1958 and how we will ensure the completion of the greater leap forward plan for 1959.

    In 1958, like all parts of the country, our factory, on the basis of the victory of the great rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, under the brilliant guidance of the general line of "Going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" put forward by the Party Central Committee, launched an unprecedented high tide of the Great Leap Forward. The process of the production Great Leap Forward moving from one high tide to another was actually a process of practical and profound communist education for our worker brothers. Through the production practice of the Great Leap Forward, the socialist and communist ideological awareness of our workers has been greatly improved. The slogans we put forward were: "Work hard today, boundless happiness tomorrow, resolutely fight for steel, don't let money take the lead." Workers voluntarily proposed to cancel overtime bonuses, and team leaders proposed to cancel team leader subsidies. Based on this enhanced communist ideological awareness, many moving heroic deeds emerged. For example, in the casting workshop of our factory, the molten iron pipeline of a large furnace failed midway, and if it was not resolved, it would affect the production of the entire factory. At this time, Communist Party member and worker Cheng Hongru rushed to repair it despite the high temperature of 1,000 degrees. His hands were burned, but he still insisted on repairing it, ensuring the smooth flow of molten iron. Communist Party member and worker Meng Xianming, in order to move and install a converter, accidentally had his eyes burned by electricity and could not open them, but he still insisted on working. Later, he was discovered by the branch secretary, and he went back, but it had already been two days. All the employees of the processing workshop once created a new record of completing an average of 1,067 work points per person per day (the plan was 480 work points per person per day). Old worker Li Shaorong once wrote a poem full of joy, enthusiasm, and soaring energy: "Come to produce during the day, sleep with the furnace at night, if the task is not completed, we will never leave the front line; refining steel and refining people, strengthening our will, sweating more today, happiness for ten thousand years." This poem not only expresses the ardent love for the Party and the factory in the hearts and wishes of each of our workers, but also reveals that the class consciousness of our worker brothers has been unprecedentedly improved and their lives are even happier. The reason why our factory was able to fully complete the 1958 plan was that under the leadership of the Party and on the basis of the improved thinking of our worker brothers, we successfully completed it.

    In terms of completing the state plan: the total output value completed 104 percent of the plan; the output of commodities completed 107 percent of the plan; and the profit delivered completed 170 percent of the plan. In terms of steelmaking: in just three months, our factory produced 665 tons of steel, including 521 tons of first-class steel and 144 tons of second-class steel. In terms of vigorously developing machine tools: we produced a total of 228 various machine tools. Making our factory appeared with a new atmosphere of "three stars shining brightly."

    The great year of 1958 has already passed in the triumphant songs of universal jubilation and victory. Now we are carrying out the tasks of 1959. From the national tasks this year, it shows that our 1959 plan is not only a plan for a great leap forward, but also a practical and feasible plan. Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out in his report: the proportion of economic construction and social, cultural, and educational expenditures in the state budget expenditure in 1959 is 72 percent, which fully shows that our 1959 plan is also a peaceful and happy construction plan. Our working class guarantees to take the lead in realizing this magnificent plan ahead of schedule.

    Now I will briefly talk about how our Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory will guarantee the completion of the 1959 plan: Our factory completed a total of 721 various spinning machines in 1958, while the state plan issued to our factory in 1959 is 1,118 units. Compared with 1958, it has increased by more than 2.5 times, which fully demonstrates the improvement of the material living standards of our people. From the above, we can see that the 1959 plan is leaping forward, glorious, and also arduous. The completion of this plan will not be smooth sailing, but we have the leadership of the Party, coupled with our revolutionary drive, the difficulties in the advance will definitely be overcome. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Strategically, we must despise difficulties, and tactically, we must pay attention to difficulties." We must think of ways, jump higher, and pluck the fruits of the 1959 leap forward. To this end, we must do the following work:

    1. Vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution
    In order to implement the annual plan and resolutely realize 53 technical measures to increase production, improve quality, reduce costs, and improve labor productivity. Among them, the casting workshop, through adjusting the area of the workshop, adopting pressure molding methods, installing high-efficiency hot blast stoves, and ensuring that cleaning work is done "one cleaning per furnace," has increased the weight of finished castings from 5,000 tons last year to about 10,000 tons.

    In order to solve the key problem that the task of the gantry planer is equivalent to 280 percent of its capacity, we have self-made nine special machine tools combining foreign and indigenous methods, such as a four-meter four-head gantry milling machine and building block machine tools, so that the large parts of the spinning machine have special machine tool processing. And after establishing a group of indigenous machines in the blank warehouse for rough processing to determine the quality, it reduces round-trip transportation and improves efficiency and the problem of insufficient area.

    After overhauling and reassembling old equipment, make it high-speed, so that old equipment can return to its youth.

    At the same time, focusing on the key to production, vigorously carry out the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, improve technology and operation, improve labor organization, and promote advanced experience.

    2. Practice thrift
    (1) Vigorously save and substitute from design and technology. By changing the design and technology, using You5 instead of No. 45 steel as the twister roller shaft and roving frame pot tooth shaft, about 25 tons of high-quality steel can be substituted throughout the year. Using galvanized iron sheet instead of tinplate as the twister roller can substitute about 29 tons of tinplate throughout the year. Using ceramics as the upper roller of the twister can save about 115 tons of low-carbon steel throughout the year. While using substitute materials, we also pay attention to quality and testing.
    (2) Strengthen tool and material management, and rectify material quotas. Various materials are centrally controlled by functional departments for key use. At the same time, saving accounts are generally established in all groups in the factory, and group economic accounting is promoted as a key task. On the basis of rectifying the process, vigorously develop material quotas. At the same time, change to centralized blanking of iron plates to improve material utilization.
    3. Further implement "two participations, three combinations" to rectify and improve the management system
    When rectifying and improving the management system, we adhere to the method of centralized leadership and hierarchical responsibility combined with worker participation in management.
    (1) Conscientiously implement the system of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management, and closely integrate cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management through mass airing of views and debates. At the same time, give full play to the role of the three-combination design team, determine technical research projects for the key to production, and organize breakthroughs.
    (2) Rectify the planning and scheduling system, especially strengthen the planning and statistical work of the groups, establish and improve the necessary systems, and gradually achieve monthly, ten-day, and daily arrangements for plans, and balanced completion of plans on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis.
    (3) Strengthen technical management with vigorously developing technology and product quality as the center. Process work should clearly formulate and revise the system of division of labor and responsibility at all levels, and systematically promote and adopt advanced technology. By conscientiously implementing the process regulations, prevent product quality accidents, and conscientiously and comprehensively check product quality standards; at the same time, combine the full-time inspection of product quality with mass quality supervision.
    (4) Strengthen financial cost management and make it a mass work, and correct the past practice of purely auditing by functional cadres.
    (5) In addition to taking some measures for the specific problems of our factory, we must also resolutely implement the policy of "the whole country is a chessboard." We not only manufacture new spinning machines, but also technically help and support the repair shops of spinning mills, so that they can quickly manufacture some frequently consumed parts, so that the old equipment can return to its youth and exert its due or higher efficiency. And we must also resolutely give way to the "six guarantees" task, and contribute our strength to ensuring the ascent of the four marshals of steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

    In order to realize the above work and ensure the completion of the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan in 1959, all the employees of our factory have made a guarantee to the Party. Our slogan is:
    The enthusiasm of the workers breaks through the sky, not afraid of difficulties in production, you chase me and we leap forward together, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully; improve labor productivity, production doubles and turns upwards, practice thrift in raw materials, and ensure to break through the material barrier; vigorously improve product quality, and make the technical revolution turn the world upside down, create new production records, and present gifts for the tenth anniversary celebration.

    When all our employees are under the leadership of the Party, building our motherland into the most beautiful and happiest society of mankind - a communist society, a small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet betrayed the motherland, colluded with imperialism, and launched an armed rebellion to undermine the unification of the motherland and undermine national unity. We were extremely indignant when we heard about it. We resolutely support the measures taken by Premier Zhou in his report on the Tibet issue. All our employees, like the Tibetan people, are happy for them to get rid of the dark life of poverty and backwardness from now on and embark on the bright road of prosperity and progress.

    Finally, I wish all our ethnic groups to unite and strive to build our motherland into communism as soon as possible.

    今日苦干一天　明日幸福无边
    钱嘉光代表谈天津纺织机械厂工人的干劲各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理和李富春、李先念二位副总理的报告及彭真副委员长的工作报告。现在我仅把我们天津纺织机械厂一九五八年一年来的工作简况及如何保证完成一九五九年更大跃进计划，作一简单发言。
    我厂在一九五八年，和全国各地一样，在伟大的整风运动和反右斗争胜利的基础上，在党中央提出的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的光辉照耀下，掀起了前所未有的大跃进的高潮。生产大跃进的由高潮走向高潮的前进过程，实际上也是我们工人兄弟们进行实际的、深刻的、共产主义教育的过程。通过大跃进的生产实践，我们工人的社会主义、共产主义思想觉悟有了很大的提高，我们提出的口号是：“今日苦战一天，明日幸福无边，坚决为钢而战，不让钞票领先”。工人自动提出取消超额奖，组长提出取消组长津贴。在这种共产主义思想觉悟提高的基础上，出现了许多可歌可颂的英雄事迹。如我厂铸工车间大炉铁水管道中途发生了故障，不解决就要影响全厂的生产，这时共产党员工人程洪孺同志冒着一千度的高温进行抢修，手被烫伤了，他仍坚持到底抢修好，保证了铁水畅流。共产党员工人孟宪铭同志，为了迁装转炉，不慎两眼被电灼伤不能睁开，但他仍然坚持工作，后来被支部书记发现，他才回去，但已经有两天了。加工车间全体职工曾创造了平均每人每天完成一千零六十七工分（计划每人每日是四百八十工分）的新纪录。老工人李少荣曾经写了一首充满愉快热情干劲冲天的诗：“白天来生产，黑夜伴炉眠，任务不完成，决不下火线；炼钢又炼人，锻炼意志坚，今天多流汗，幸福万万年。”这首诗不仅表达了我们每一个工人爱党爱厂的火热心理和愿望，而且也揭示出了我们工人弟兄们的阶级觉悟空前提高生活更加幸福。我们厂一九五八年的计划所以能够全面完成，就是在党的领导下，在工人弟兄们的思想提高基础上胜利完成的。
    在完成国家计划方面：总产值完成计划的百分之一百零四；商品产量完成计划百分之一百零七；上激利润完成计划的百分之一百七十。在炼钢方面：仅三个月，我厂就炼出六百六十五吨钢，其中一类钢五百二十一吨；二类钢一百四十四吨。在大搞机床方面：我们共制出各种机床二百二十八台。使我厂出现了“三星高照”的新气象。
    伟大的一九五八年已经在万众欢腾胜利的凯歌中过去了，现在我们正执行着一九五九年的任务，从今年的全国各项任务来看，都说明了我们一九五九年计划既是一个大跃进的计划，又是一个切实可行的计划。李先念副总理的报告中指出：一九五九年国家预算支出中经济建设和社会文教费所占的比例为百分之七十二，这充分说明了，我国一九五九年计划，又是一个和平幸福的建设计划。我们工人阶级保证“一马当先”的提前实现这一宏伟的计划。
    现在我把我们天津纺织机械厂如何保证完成一九五九年的计划简单地谈一谈：我厂一九五八年共完成各种纱机七百二十一台，而一九五九年国家下达给我厂的计划为一千一百十八台。与五八年相比较，增加了二点五倍以上，这充分显示了我国人民物质生活水平的提高。从上述我们可以看出：一九五九年计划是跃进的，光荣的，同时也是艰巨的。完成这个计划决不会一帆风顺，但是，我们有党的领导，再加上我们的革命干劲，前进中的困难一定会被克服。我们要按照毛主席所教导我们的“在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难”的指示，我们要大想办法，跳得更高，把一九五九年的跃进果子摘下来。为此我们要作以下的工作：
    一、大搞技术革新和技术革命
    为使全年计划落实，坚决实现五十三项增加生产，提高质量，降低成本和提高劳动生产率的技术措施。其中铸工车间通过采取调整场房面积，采用压模造型方法，安装高效能的热风炉，以及清整工作作到“一炉一清”等措施后，使铸件成品重量，由去年五千吨，提高到一万吨左右。
    为了解决龙门刨床的任务相当能力的百分之二百八十的关键问题，自制四公尺四头龙门铣床，积木式机床等的洋土结合的专用机床共九部，使纱机大件有了专用机床加工。并在毛胚库建立土机群进行粗加工后定性，减少往复运输，提高效率和面积不足问题。
    对旧设备检修改装后，作到高速化，使旧设备返老还童。
    同时围绕生产关键，大力开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约竞赛运动，改进技术和操作，改善劳动组织，推广先进经验。
    二、厉行节约
    （一）从设计和工艺上大力节约、代用。通过改变设计和工艺，用尢5代替45号钢，作捻线机滚筒轴和粗纱机盆子牙轴等，全年代用优质钢二十五吨左右。用镀锌铁板代替马口铁作捻线机滚筒，全年可以代用马口铁二十九吨左右。以陶磁作捻线机上罗拉，全年可以节约低炭钢一百十五吨左右。在使代用材料的同时还注意质量和试验工作。
    （二）加强工具和材料管理，整顿材料定额。对各种材料由职能部门进行集中掌握，重点使用。同时在全厂各小组普遍建立节约账，并重点推行小组经济核算。在整顿工艺的基础上，大搞材料定额。同时改为铁板集中下料，提高材料利用率。
    三、进一步贯彻“两参，三结合”整顿与健全管理制度
    在整改与健全管理制度时，我们本着集中领导分级负责，同工人参加管理相结合的方法。
    （一）认真贯彻执行干部参加劳动和工人参加管理制度，通过群众性的鸣放，使干部参加劳动和工人参加管理紧紧地结合起来。同时充分发挥三结合设计组的作用，针对生产关键确定技术研究项目，并组织突破关键。
    （二）整顿计划调度系统，特别是加强小组的计划和统计工作，建立与健全必要制度，逐步作到，按月、按旬、按日的安排计划，按月、按旬、按日的均衡完成计划。
    （三）以大搞工艺和产品质量为中心，加强技术管理。工艺工作要明确制订和修改各级分工负责的制度，有计划的推广和采用先进工艺。通过认真贯彻工艺规程，预防产品质量事故，认真全面检查产品质量标准；同时使产品质量的专职检查和群众性的质量监督结合起来。
    （四）加强财务成本管理，使它成为群众性的工作，纠正过去单纯由职能干部进行审核的办法。
    （五）除了针对我厂具体问题采取一些措施以外，我们还要坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针。我们不仅制造新的纱机，还要在技术上帮助和支援纱厂修理间，使他们很快制造一些经常消耗的机件，让旧有的设备返老还童，发挥它应有或更高的效率。并且还要坚决的为“六保”任务让路，为保证钢、煤、粮、棉四大元帅升帐中，拿出我们的力量。
    为实现上述工作，保证完成一九五九年更大、更好、更全面的跃进计划，我厂全体职工已经向党提出保证，我们口号是：
    职工干劲冲破天，不怕生产有困难，你追我赶齐跃进，苦干实干加巧干；提高劳动生产率，生产成倍往上翻，厉行节约原材料，保证突破材料关；产品质量大力搞，技术革命闹翻天，创造生产新纪录，十年大庆把礼献。
    当我们全体职工正在党的领导下，为把祖国建设成为人类最美好、最幸福的社会——共产主义社会的时候，西藏的一小撮反动分子背叛了祖国，勾结帝国主义，发动破坏祖国统一，破坏民族团结的武装叛乱。我们听了极为愤慨，我们坚决拥护周总理报告中对西藏问题采取的措施，我们全体职工和西藏人民一样，为他们从此摆脱贫困、落后的黑暗生活，走上繁荣进步的光明大道而高兴。
    最后祝我们各族人民团结起来，为把我们祖国早日建成共产主义而奋斗。
