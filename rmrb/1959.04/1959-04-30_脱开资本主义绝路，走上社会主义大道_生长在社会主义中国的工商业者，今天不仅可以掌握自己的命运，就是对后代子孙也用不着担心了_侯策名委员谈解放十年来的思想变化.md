Chairman, fellow committee members:

I feel very honored and excited to attend this meeting. Listening to the reports of the central party and government leaders at the conference, especially Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, has not only given me a profound socialist education but also pointed out the brilliant achievements of the Great Leap Forward, which has greatly inspired and enlightened me. I guarantee to resolutely implement them in my future work.

Now, I am prepared to make a speech about my own journey towards a new life over the past ten years since liberation, under the continuous cultivation and education of the Party, and under the call of the great policy of peaceful transformation.

I am a capitalist from the Zigong salt fields in Sichuan. In the decades before liberation, in addition to helping other capitalists exploit workers, I myself directly exploited workers for more than thirty years, owning more than a dozen large and small enterprises (including salt wells, salt stoves, salt shops, and money shops, etc.). Although I had a lot of money and large enterprises, I fantasized about developing a complete set of capitalist enterprises. However, from the production area to the sales area, under the ravages and oppression of imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and bureaucratic capital, not only could I not develop, but I was often in a precarious state. At that time, the national industrialists and businessmen in our city were so oppressed that they could hardly breathe. Coupled with the long-term rule of the Sichuan warlords, not to mention the heavy tax burden, years of war led to traffic congestion and market depression, resulting in a disconnect between production and sales, with production but no sales. In addition, the warlords extorted and plundered, and the entire salt field was often in a state of poverty, making it impossible to develop production. In such a society, we industrialists and businessmen could not control our own destiny. Since liberation, it has been completely the opposite. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of the government, the entire salt field production was fully restored in March and April of 1950, and continued to develop with stable prices. My enterprise was restored and developed with the strong support of the government. Through previous movements, I deeply realized that it was precisely the Party's wise policy of peaceful transformation that saved me from the dead end of capitalism. However, after the Party's general line for the transition period was announced, I had wavering thoughts on the issue of taking the path of state capitalism, both wanting to engage in joint ventures and fearing them. The main reason for wanting to engage in joint ventures was that I saw that there were no labor-capital relations in the joint ventures, which could give play to the workers' production enthusiasm and enable production to continuously develop forward. Secondly, I saw that joint ventures were all included in the national plan, and their raw material supply could be guaranteed, so there would be no production stoppage due to lack of raw materials. But on the other hand, I was afraid that the asset assessment after the joint venture could not be fair and reasonable, so I was worried and hesitated. Later, through studying the general line and the Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Enterprises, I began to realize the superiority of joint ventures and the considerate nature of the redemption policy, which dispelled my ideological concerns. At the beginning of 1954, I voluntarily applied for joint ventures for all my enterprises. After the joint venture, in the face of many iron facts, it gave me a great practical education and further strengthened my confidence in taking the socialist road.

Through the joint venture, although the issue of the two roads in the economy was basically resolved, after the great anti-rightist rectification movement began in 1957, I had an extremely sympathetic and wavering attitude towards the rightists. I could not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and I could not distinguish between right and wrong. Later, with the fierce and in-depth struggle, in the face of a large number of facts, I clearly saw that the rightists' anti-Party and anti-socialist stance was not accidental. Their long-standing dream of capitalist restoration attempted to drag industrialists and businessmen onto the death road of capitalism. Therefore, it aroused anger and I struggled against the rightists. At the same time, I realized that the reason why I initially had serious feelings of tenderness towards the rightists was entirely due to my class feelings at work, which was the inevitable reflection of not abandoning the reactionary stance of capitalism. Through a historically significant anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement, I received a relatively profound socialist education, realizing that I must constantly carry out a fundamental transformation in order to embark on the happy future of socialism.

In general, in the past ten years since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the call of the great policy of peaceful transformation, my transformation process from capitalism to socialism has indeed gone through a tortuous process. It is precisely in the advancement that there are repetitions, and in the repetitions that there is advancement. In short, through a series of movements, I have received a lot of education. I deeply realize that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and through a series of studies and transformations, everyone has seen that the socialist future is indeed full of radiance. Our country has been liberated for less than ten years, and our steel production has increased from less than 100,000 tons before liberation to 11.08 million tons. This development speed and coal production have exceeded that of the United Kingdom. Our cotton production has exceeded that of the United States, ranking first in the world. In 1958, in addition to the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton doubling, there were also locomotives, automobiles, antibiotics, power generation equipment, papermaking equipment, cotton spinning machines, power machinery, grain combine harvesters, railway track laying mileage, etc., all of which increased by more than doubled compared to 1957. The development speed of our country's Great Leap Forward is truly unprecedented and infinitely exciting and encouraging! Furthermore, in terms of transportation, we in Sichuan did not have a single railway in the past. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which had been talked about for decades, was never built under the rule of the reactionaries. In the short span of seven years after liberation, by 1956, we had completed the "Chengdu-Chongqing" and "Baoji-Chengdu" two long trunk lines, and there are currently many railways under construction. Taking the salt production in our Zigong city as an example, the highest annual output before liberation was less than 5 million dan [a unit of weight], while in the previous year, under the leadership of the Party, it had reached more than 9.3 million dan. This year, the people of our city are full of confidence in a greater leap forward, and they will definitely be able to complete 12 million dan under the leadership of the Party, which is not a problem. In the past, there were basically no chemical products, but today we are already able to produce more than 60 kinds, among which the quality of barium chloride exceeded that of the United Kingdom as early as last year. Last year, the output value of chemical industry exceeded the total output value of salt. This year, the total output value of chemical industry in our city increased three times compared to last year. The output value of the first chemical plant alone is 100 million yuan, and some products have been sold abroad. Some products that used to need to be imported are now exported. In March of this year, an on-site conference of sixteen provinces and cities was held in Zigong City to learn from each other and encourage each other. Today, under the leadership of the Party, the people of our city are working hard for three years to transform the salt capital into a chemical city. This significant development and change fully shows that socialism and capitalism are indeed a stark contrast, and as long as our industrialists and businessmen can recognize the laws of social development, sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, and accept socialist transformation, they can completely control their own destiny. The facts of the past ten years since liberation have fully proven this point. Many people in our business community have not only received meticulous care from the Party in terms of economy and life after liberation, but also received the Party's cultivation and trust in politics. Some have become people's representatives, some have become members of the CPPCC, and people from our business community participate in political organizations at all levels. Take me as an example! Since liberation, under the continuous cultivation and education of the Party, I have also become the vice mayor of Zigong City, the vice chairman of the Municipal CPPCC, a representative of the Provincial People's Congress, and a member of the National CPPCC. These political honors are things that our industrialists and businessmen never had in the old society and could never get. Industrialists and businessmen growing up in socialist China and the era of Chairman Mao can not only control their own destiny today, but also need not worry about their descendants. In the face of the socialist system with infinite vitality and unparalleled superiority, I deeply feel that the capitalist system is indeed decadent and dark, and the capitalist road is not only impassable but also should not be taken. Only by following the Communist Party wholeheartedly and taking the socialist road, and honestly accepting socialist transformation, will the future be bright. This is my personal experience in the past few years since liberation. Today, under the leadership and education of the Party, although I have embarked on a new life path and have made certain progress in politics and ideology, my capitalist stance and bourgeois ideology are still quite strong, which is incompatible with the current greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward situation. Although I am 73 years old, I am determined to transform my capitalist stance and have the confidence to continue to work hard with everyone in the Great Leap Forward. I must unreservedly contribute my little experience in managing salt production for decades to the socialist motherland, strive to eradicate the roots of exploitation as soon as possible, and transform myself into a genuine worker. In the future, I will also continue to study under the leadership of the Party, work conscientiously and responsibly, strengthen self-transformation, actively serve, and use practical actions to achieve a greater leap forward this year to welcome the tenth anniversary of our great motherland!

    脱开资本主义绝路，走上社会主义大道
    生长在社会主义中国的工商业者，今天不仅可以掌握自己的命运，就是对后代子孙也用不着担心了
    侯策名委员谈解放十年来的思想变化主席、各位委员：
    我出席这次会议感到非常光荣和兴奋，在大会上听了各位中央党政首长的报告，特别是周恩来总理的政府工作报告，既使我受到了深刻的社会主义教育，又给我指明了大跃进的辉煌成就，使我受到莫大的鼓舞和启示，我保证在今后工作中，坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我准备就自己解放十年来，在党的不断培养教育下，在伟大的和平改造政策的感召下，使我走上了新生的道路过程，作一个发言。
    我是四川自贡盐场的一个资本家，在解放前的数十年中，除了帮其他资本家剥削工人外，自己直接剥削工人也在三十年以上，拥有大小企业（包括盐井、盐灶、盐号、钱庄等）十余个。虽然钱多企业大，幻想发展一套完整的资本主义企业。但是由产区到销区在帝国主义、国民党反动派和官僚资本的摧残压迫下，不仅不能发展，而且经常处在朝不保夕的飘摇状态中。当时我市的民族工商业者，可以说是压得来出不了气，又加上四川军阀的长期统治，重税负担且不说，年年打仗，弄得来交通阻塞，市场萧条，致使产销脱节，只产不销，兼之军阀的敲诈勒索，整个盐场经常陷于穷困的境地，根本无法发展生产。在这样的社会里我们工商业者是无法掌握自己的命运的。解放以来与此完全相反，我们工商业者在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在政府的大力扶持下，整个盐场生产在一九五○年的三、四月就全部恢复了起来，并在物价稳定的情况下，还不断地得到了发展，我的企业就是在政府的大力扶持下，恢复和发展起来的。通过历次运动，深深体会到，正是党的英明和平改造政策的挽救，把自己从资本主义的绝路上，拯救了出来。但是在党的过渡时期总路线公布以后，对于走国家资本主义道路的问题，我的思想上又产生了既想合营又怕合营的动摇情绪，想合营主要是见到合营企业里没有劳资关系，就可发挥工人的生产积极性，使生产能够不断地向前发展；其次见到合营企业都是纳入了国家计划的，它的原材料供应，可以得到保证，也就不会产生因缺乏原材料而停产。但是另一方面又怕合营后清产核资不能做到公平合理，因而七上八下顾虑重重，后来通过总路线的学习和公私合营企业暂行条例的学习，才使我开始认识到合营企业的优越性，赎买政策的照顾性，打消了思想顾虑，一九五四年初就自愿地把我全部企业申请了合营。合营后在很多铁的事实面前，给了我很大的实际教育，更增强了我走社会主义道路的信心。
    通过合营后，我虽然在经济上两条道路的问题，基本上得到了解决，但是一九五七年伟大的反右整风运动开始后，我思想上又产生了极端同情右派的动摇态度，划不清敌我，分不清楚是非。后来斗争的猛烈深入，在大量事实面前，才使我清楚地看出了右派分子的反党反社会主义不是偶然的，他们由来已久的梦想资本主义复辟，企图把工商业拖上资本主义的死亡道路，因此，才激起了愤怒，向右派进行斗争，同时也才察觉了起初之所以对右派产生严重的温情主义，完全是我的阶级感情在作怪，也就是资本主义的反动立场没有抛弃的必然反映。通过一场具有历史意义的反右派斗争和整风运动，才使我受到了一场较为深刻的社会主义教育，认识到，必须不断进行脱胎换骨的本质改造，才能走上社会主义的幸福前途。
    总的说来，解放十年来，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在伟大的和平改造政策的感召下，我从资本主义到社会主义的改造过程中，确是经过了一个迂回曲折的过程，也正是在前进中有反复，在反复中前进的。总之，通过一系列的运动，给了我的教育不少，我深切体会到，我们工商业者在党和毛主席的英明领导下，通过一系列的学习和改造，大家看到了社会主义前途确是光芒万丈。我们国家解放还不到十年，我们的钢产量已由解放前的不到十万吨，增加到一千一百零八万吨，这个发展速度和煤炭的产量，已经超过了英国。我国棉花产量已超过美国，占世界第一位。一九五八年我国除钢铁、煤炭、粮食、棉花四大指标翻了一番以外，还有机车、汽车、抗菌素、发电设备、造纸设备、棉纺机、动力机械、谷物联合收割机、铁路铺轨里程等等，均较一九五七年增长了一倍以上。我国这种大跃进的发展速度，真是史无前例，令人无限的兴奋、鼓舞！再从交通运输来说，我们四川过去一条铁路也没有，闹了几十年的成渝铁路在反动派的统治下，始终没有修起来，解放后短短七年的时间，到一九五六年我们就修通了“成渝”“宝成”两条长干线，目前还有不少铁路，正在兴工。就拿我们自贡市的盐产来讲，解放前最高年产量还不到五百万担，而前年在党的领导下已达到九百三十万担以上，今年我市人民在更大跃进中信心百倍，一定能在党的领导下，完成一千二百万担不成问题，过去基本上没有化工产品，而今天却已经能够生产六十余种，其中氯化钡的质量，早在去年就超过了英国。去年的化工产值，已超过了盐的总产值。今年我市的化工总产值比去年增三倍。内中化工第一厂的产值就有一亿元，有些产品已销到国外。以前有些需要进口的产品现在还出口了。今年三月还在自贡市召开了十六省市的现场会议，互相学习，互相鼓励。今天我市人民在党的领导下，正在苦战三年，变盐都为化工城。这种显著的发展变化，完全看出了社会主义和资本主义确是一个鲜明的对照，而我们工商业者，只要能够认清社会发展的规律，真诚接受党的领导，接受社会主义改造，完全可以掌握自己的命运。解放十年来的事实已经充分证明了这一点，我们工商界中的不少人，解放后不仅在经济上、生活上得到了党的无微不至的照顾，而且在政治上也得到了党的培养和信任，有些人当上了人民代表，有些人当上了政协委员，各级政权组织中都有我们工商界的人士参加，就拿我来讲吧！解放以来，在党的不断培养教育下，也当上了自贡市的副市长、市政协副主席、省人民代表和全国政协委员，这些政治上的光荣，都是我们工商业者在旧社会里根本没有过的也是根本得不到的事情。生长在社会主义中国、毛主席时代的工商业者，今天不仅可以掌握自己的命运，就是后代子孙，也用不着担心了。在具有无限生命力和无比优越性的社会主义制度面前，真使我深深感到，资本主义制度确是腐朽黑暗，资本主义道路不仅走不通，而且也不应该走，只有跟着共产党死心踏地的走社会主义道路，老老实实地接受社会主义改造，前途才是光明的。这是我解放几年来的亲身体验。今天我在党的领导和教育下，虽然走上了新生的道路，在政治上思想上也得到了一定的进步，但是，我的资本主义立场和资产阶级思想还是相当浓厚的，这和今年更大更好更全面的大跃进形势是不能相容的。我虽然年已七十三岁，但是，我有决心改造资本主义立场，有信心和大家一起继续努力大跃进。我一定要把几十年来经营盐业生产的点滴经验毫不保留地贡献给社会主义祖国，争取早日把剥削根子铲除干净，并把自己改造成为名副其实的劳动者。今后我还要在党的领导下不断的学习，认真负责的工作，加强自我改造，积极服务，并要以实现今年更大跃进的实际行动，来迎接我们伟大祖国的十周年大庆！
