Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th -- Some political figures and monopoly capitalist newspapers in the United States continue to clamor about the armed rebellion of the Tibetan reactionaries. They support the Tibetan rebels, instigate movements hostile to China, and sow discord between China and its neighbors.

Fulbright, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, delivered a speech in the Senate yesterday, falsely claiming that the armed rebellion of the Tibetan rebels was a "struggle for freedom," and again slandered the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion as "barbaric repression." He also attempted to portray Tibet as an "independent country," nonsensically claiming that the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion "violated" the "principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs." He encouraged the rebels, saying that the Tibetan rebellion had "aroused the deepest sympathy" in the United States.

Senator Case wrote to Acting Secretary of State Herter on the 7th, suggesting that the Dalai Lama be invited to "visit" the United States, believing that this was "a way for the United States to express its sympathy for the Tibetan people." He also said that the U.S. government "should use every opportunity, in the clearest possible way" to express its support for the Tibetan rebellion. Republican Senator Butler also telegraphed Acting Secretary of State Herter yesterday, suggesting that the United States invite the rebels to the United States to organize a so-called "government in exile" in order to carry out activities against China under direct U.S. control.

Many American newspapers have recently published articles one after another, using the most vicious words to express their hostility to China's quelling of the Tibetan rebellion. The "Christian Science Monitor" on the 5th slandered that the events in Tibet provided evidence of "communist expansion." The "New York Daily News" on the 4th cursed the Chinese government as "barbarians." The "New York Times" on the 5th clamored that China's suppression of the rebels was a "desecration of the sacred."

Some American newspapers and news agencies are also taking the opportunity to encourage the rebels and sow discord between China and its neighbors. The "New York Times" said on the 4th that the rebels' kidnapping of the Dalai Lama "may only be the beginning of the story," and "the flames of Tibet will certainly not be easily extinguished." In an article published by Alsop in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 3rd, he openly clamored that Tibet "is an ideal country for resistance." Alsop also engaged in malicious provocation, "reminding" Asian countries to pay attention to the fact that "for the past four thousand years," "China has consistently been imperialistic" and has "carried out an endless movement of expanding power" on the Asian continent.

He said: "When China has a central government as strong as it is now, all of China's neighbors will once again feel its threat."

The Associated Press reported on the 5th that a U.S. "missionary" and "intelligence officer" Erwall, who has been active in Tibet for a long time, said that after China quelled the Tibetan rebellion, China would "seriously covet" the "fertile land" of its neighbors.

    支持西藏叛匪，诬蔑中国人民
    美国政客和报刊恶毒叫嚷
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国一些政界人物和垄断资本集团的报刊继续就西藏反动分子的武装叛乱事件进行叫嚷，支持西藏叛乱分子，煽动敌视中国的运动，并挑拨中国同邻国间的关系。
    美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特昨天在参议院发表演说，信口雌黄地把西藏叛乱分子的武装叛乱说做是“争取自由”，再次诬蔑中国政府讨伐叛乱是“野蛮镇压”。他还企图把西藏说成是一个“独立的国家”，胡说什么中国政府镇压叛乱是“违反了”“不干涉他国内政的原则”。他给叛乱分子打气说，西藏叛乱在美国“引起了最深切的同情”。
    参议员凯斯7日写信给美国代理国务卿赫脱，建议邀请达赖喇嘛“访问”美国，他认为这是“美国可以借以表示对西藏人民的同情的一个方式”。他还说，美国政府“应该利用每一个机会、尽可能明确的方式”表示对西藏叛乱的支持。共和党参议员巴特勒昨天也打电报给代理国务卿赫脱，建议美国邀请叛乱分子到美国组织一个所谓“流亡政府”以便在美国直接控制下进行反对中国的活动。
    许多美国报纸最近连续发表文章，用尽了恶毒的字眼来表示它们对中国平息西藏叛乱的敌意。5日的“基督教科学箴言报”诬蔑说，西藏的事件提供了“共产主义扩张的”证据。4日的“纽约每日新闻”骂中国政府是“野蛮人”。5日的“纽约时报”叫嚣中国镇压叛乱分子是“亵渎神圣”。
    一些美国报纸和通讯社还在乘机为叛乱分子打气。并且挑拨中国和邻国的关系。4日“纽约时报”说，叛乱分子劫走达赖喇嘛“可能只是故事的开始”，“西藏的火焰一定不会平易地熄灭”。“纽约先驱论坛报”3日发表的艾尔索普的文章中，公开叫嚣说西藏“是一个理想的抵抗国家”。艾尔索普并且进行恶意的挑拨，他“提醒”亚洲的国家注意，“过去四千年中”“中国一贯是帝国主义”，在亚洲大陆上“进行了无穷尽的扩张权力运动”。
    他说：“当中国有一个像目前那样强大的中央政府时，中国的所有邻国就会再度感觉到它的威胁。”
    美联社5日报道一个在西藏进行长期活动的美国“传教士”和“情报官员”埃耳瓦耳的谈话说，在中国平息了西藏叛乱之后，中国将“认真地觊觎”它的邻国的“肥沃土地”。
