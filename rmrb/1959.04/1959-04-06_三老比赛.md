    Three Elders Competition
    At the spring plowing mobilization meeting of the Shuikou Brigade of the Wuzi Yun Commune in Chongyi County, Jiangxi, commune members issued challenges and accepted them. Old commune member Yang Dachun walked onto the stage, pounded the table with his fist, and said loudly, "We old folks will compete against each other, who dares to accept the challenge?" Female cook Deng Dingfeng (nearly sixty years old) loudly responded, "Old Yang! I'll compete with you, you go to the front line to engage in production, and I'll cook in the rear, let's see who has more enthusiasm." As soon as Deng Dingfeng finished speaking, Liao Maoxin, sixty-nine years old, also accepted the challenge from Old Yang: "I'm still good at raising cattle, I'll compete with you in this area!" After the meeting, he asked the team to be responsible for raising four cattle well.
    The three elders competition began the next day. Old Man Yang was strong and energetic, capable of using both the ox and the hoe, and worked in the fields with the young commune members every day, plowing and harrowing, and everyone called him an old hero. Although Old Man Maoxin was older, his enthusiasm was no less, and all four cattle were well raised. He went in and out every day, also collecting wild manure and cutting firewood. Granny Dingfeng cooked both dry and thick rice, and everyone enjoyed the three meals. The three elders competition is still going on, and who will be the champion will be determined by the commune members after the spring plowing.

    三老比赛
    在江西崇义县伍子云公社水口大队的春耕誓师大会上，社员们互相提出了挑战应战。老社员杨大春走上讲台，用拳头使劲擂桌子，大声说：“我们老的跟老的比，哪个强手敢应战？”女炊事员邓丁凤（年近六十）高声应战：“老杨！我跟你赛，你上前线搞生产，我在后方煮饭菜，比比谁的干劲大。”邓丁凤的话音刚落，六十九岁的廖茂新也向老杨应了战：“我养牛还行，我在这方面跟你比赛！”会后他向队里要求负责养好四条牛。
    三老比赛就在第二天开始了。杨老汉身体强，力气足，使牛用锄样样都能干，天天同青年社员一起下田，犁田耙田，大家称他是老英雄。茂新老汉虽年纪较大，但干劲却不小，四条牛都养得壮实。他每天进进出出，还捎带检野粪，割柴草。丁凤大娘煮饭有干有稀，三餐茶饭，都能使大家合口。三老竞赛还在继续进行，谁是冠军，还待春耕后社员们评定。
