　　Half-Monthly International Review
　　(April 1st to 15th)

　　The West's Countercurrents and Divisions

　　With the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference soon to be held in Geneva, and the possibility of a summit meeting also increasing, there is now reason to hope and demand that politicians of all countries continue to work in this direction to hasten the arrival of a period when the cold war ice melts.
　　But if this demand is used to measure the attitude of the leaders of the Western camp, it is difficult to be satisfied. It seems that in the face of the changed situation, Western countries still want to adhere to their outdated policies, as can be seen at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Washington in early April.
　　At this three-day meeting "celebrating" the tenth anniversary of the North Atlantic Group, in addition to the usual boasting about the "unity" and "cooperation" between the already flawed imperialist groups, the main topics of discussion were the Berlin issue and the German issue. According to Western news agencies, the decision made at the meeting was that at the upcoming East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference, Western countries will "not propose a draft peace treaty with Germany", "not accept any type of confederation of the two Germanys", and believe that the Berlin issue and the "freezing" of armaments are "closely related" to the German reunification issue, and that the "final steps" to achieve German reunification include "free elections". Needless to say, the purpose of this so-called "package" plan is to entangle the Berlin issue and the German peace treaty issue, which are now ripe for resolution, with the completely unrealistic German reunification issue, first obstructing the conclusion of the treaty and the end of the occupation regime in West Berlin, and then pushing German reunification into the distant future. To submerge partial issues that can be solved conditionally in the overall situation that cannot be solved simultaneously is a consistent trick of Western countries to obstruct the resolution of major outstanding international issues. Some time ago, only under the pressure of Soviet proposals and strong world public opinion, Western countries had to pretend to take a so-called "flexible" attitude to cover up the eyes and ears of the world. But when they were forced to show their cards because the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference was really approaching, they disregarded exposing their true colors and still resorted to the old rigid policies and delaying tactics. It is even more noteworthy that some Western military leaders, such as Norstad and McElroy, have recently been constantly issuing war cries, poisoning the international atmosphere. People must not relax their vigilance against this countercurrent in the international situation.
　　But on the other hand, it should also be seen that this consensus among Western countries to try to maintain the illegal right to occupy West Berlin and obstruct the rational resolution of the German issue cannot hide the divisions between them. The problem is that the Geneva Conference is different from the Washington Conference. At the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference under the public gaze, it is impossible for Western countries to simply use a "no" to deal with everything. And what method to use to both delay the solution of substantive issues and shirk their responsibilities, escape the world's accusations, and even improve their current predicament, is still undecided within Western countries. The current division is particularly evident in the contradictions between Britain and West Germany. Due to its own political and economic interests, Britain currently tends to seek a temporary "compromise" solution on the Berlin issue and the German issue, and is willing to see some "loosening" of the current deadlock. Although Britain retreated somewhat from its original position at the Washington Conference under pressure from the United States, it cannot be said that Britain is not prepared to continue acting in its own direction. Following Macmillan, British Field Marshal Montgomery also announced that he would visit the Soviet Union. This trend in Britain has aroused extreme dissatisfaction in West Germany. The West German government opposes any changes in the German issue, fearing that "a single hair can move the whole body", endangering the position of the entire West German ruling group and the reactionary policy of rearmament. Because behind this political division also lies the economic contradiction between Britain's "free trade zone" and West Germany's "small Europe" "common market", the open and secret struggles between Britain and West Germany have intensified. The contradiction between Britain and West Germany occupies a very prominent position in the Western camp and has become an important obstacle to Western countries seeking a final consensus on the German issue. According to Reuters, this situation has caused "deep anxiety" in Washington. It is believed there that "there is not much time" before the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference on May 11, and therefore "the greatest effort must be made to eliminate differences of opinion". But it also said that the "outlook for" eliminating these differences is "bleak".
　　While the contradiction between West Germany and Britain is becoming increasingly acute, the contradictions within the West German ruling group are further developing and tending to surface. Adenauer, who has always acted arbitrarily in the West German government, recently announced that he will give up his position as Chancellor and run for President due to the decision of the leadership of his party, the Christian Democratic Union. In fact, this is a promotion in name but a demotion in reality. Adenauer's resignation reflects the unpopularity of his rigid policy of opposing a peaceful solution to the German issue and easing international tensions. For several years, due to this policy, the Adenauer group has become increasingly isolated in West Germany and has been subjected to increasing condemnation internationally. This development will obviously shake the ruling position of the Christian Democratic Union and there is a risk of being defeated by its opponent, the West German Social Democratic Party, in the 1961 general election. Therefore, regardless of Adenauer's own opposition, the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union made the decision for him to resign. Although this does not mean a fundamental change in the current policy of the West German government, it at least shows that Adenauer's original extremely stubborn policy has gone bankrupt.
　　For many years, Adenauer has been a firm defender of the US policy of strength and cold war policy. Therefore, his resignation today actually reflects the failure of the US aggressive policy, especially its policy towards Germany. Although Adenauer himself and some advocates of the US policy of strength still want to continue to struggle and use the old methods to obstruct the trend of easing the overall international situation and the solution of major problems, as in the past, things will obviously not develop according to the subjective wishes of these stubborn factions, and the more stubborn they are, the more they will fall into an increasingly isolated, passive, and difficult situation.

　　Regarding the Relations Between Arab Countries

　　Recently, the relations between Arab countries have attracted people's attention.
　　At the end of March, UAR President Nasser held talks with Lebanese President Chehab. Although the Lebanese newspaper "Al-Sharq" reported before the talks that "The United Arab Republic wants to win Lebanon's support against Iraq through Nasser's upcoming talks with Lebanese President Chehab", the final communique did not mention the issue of UAR-Iraq or Lebanese-Iraqi relations. Most newspapers in Beirut believed that the talks reaffirmed Lebanon's independence and its neutrality towards various Arab countries. "Al-Hurriyya" pointed out that "The Lebanese people are very concerned about the policy of neutrality, and are concerned about not allowing anyone to use Lebanon as a base to launch attacks against other Arab countries."
　　From April 2 to 7, the Arab League Political Committee held a meeting of Arab Foreign Ministers in the Lebanese capital. According to reports, the originally proposed agenda for the meeting was: "The current state of relations between the UAR and Iraq, the dangers that this situation poses to Arab unity, and methods to change this situation." The meeting lasted for six days and issued a communique. Since no concrete results were obtained on the issues discussed, the communique announced that the committee was in a "state of long-term meeting". The Sudanese representative finally refused to sign the communique of the meeting because he believed that some of the provisions of the communique were unacceptable to his country. The Sudanese Foreign Minister stated on April 15 that Sudan refused to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs and was not bound by the resolutions passed at the Beirut meeting.
　　The Beirut meeting was originally convened at the suggestion of Sudan and decided in Cairo, supposedly to "mediate" the "tense relations" between the UAR and Iraq. However, unlike previous meetings of the Arab League Political Committee, only six countries, including the UAR, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Yemen, and Sudan, attended the meeting out of the ten member states of the League, while Iraq refused to participate, and Tunisia, Libya, and Jordan did not send representatives.
　　Iraq did not agree to participate in the meeting. A commentary on Baghdad Radio on April 3 pointed out that the current "problem is not a mediation that is unacceptable to Iraq, because Iraq respects the Arab League and faithfully implements the policy of Arab unity, and it has not interfered in the affairs of any Arab country." Rather, the problem is that Iraq is being subjected to foreign "interference and aggression." The Libyan government believes that since Iraq did not participate in the meeting, it refused to participate in the meeting. The Tunisian ruling party's newspaper "Action" pointed out in a commentary that Tunisia refused to participate in the meeting "to avoid aimless disputes."
　　According to reports in Arab newspapers, the majority of the Arab countries' delegations attending the meeting were clearly unwilling to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs, endangering the unity and normal relations between Arab countries. Moroccan chief delegate Abdallah Ibrahim, when talking about the UAR representative's accusations against Iraq, believed that it was unreasonable to only listen to one side's explanation, especially because the UAR had once been subjected to the same accusations, but facts proved that these accusations were unfounded. The Moroccan Prime Minister and Foreign Minister said in response to a question from a reporter from "Al-Sharq": "I don't want to stand on the side of one Arab country against another Arab country." According to Beirut's "Al-Binaa", representatives from Morocco, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia said that if Iraq openly violated the Arab League Charter and harmed Arab unity, then the League would have the right to condemn Iraq. However, they pointed out that Iraq was complaining that someone was interfering in its internal affairs and accusing the UAR of creating the Mosul rebellion. Saudi Arabian representative Prince Faisal said in response to a question from a Lebanese newspaper reporter: "Arab countries make up a large family. In this family, each Arab country lives independently in a room, and it has the right to do what it likes in its own house."
　　A reporter from Cairo's "Al-Ahram" who covered the meeting said, "It seems difficult to make a bold decision against Iraq at the Beirut meeting." Beirut's "Al-Hayat" pointed out, "Nasser's representative felt that he had become isolated, and therefore he became somewhat agitated."

　　The Japanese People Demand to Get Rid of American Control and Strive for National Independence

　　The movement of the Japanese people to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" is deepening and expanding throughout the country. At present, many prefectures in Japan have established joint struggle organizations and have universally launched publicity campaigns against the Japan-US "Security Treaty". The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and neutral trade unions, which have more than 3 million members, are also continuing to organize national unified actions for the spring struggle, with the central demand of abolishing the "Security Treaty". On April 15, the Japanese people, under the call of the "National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-US Security Treaty" composed of more than 140 organizations, held the "All People Unified Action Day to Abolish the Security Treaty and Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty". In many prefectures and regions, prefectural meetings, regional meetings, and workplace meetings were held; students in Tokyo also held collective petitions to Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi.
　　The rapid expansion of the Japanese people's movement against the Japan-US "Security Treaty" shows that more and more people in Japan are demanding to get rid of American control and strive for national independence. Now, not only are the broad masses of Japanese working people, intellectuals, and small and medium-sized bourgeoisie actively participating in this struggle, but even a part of the Japanese ruling structure is expressing its desire to defend peace and national independence. Only the Nobusuke Kishi government, not only disregards the demands of the broad masses of Japanese people to get rid of American control and safeguard national sovereignty; on the contrary, it is also attempting to beautify and strengthen this chain that enslaves the Japanese nation through negotiations with the US government to revise the Japan-US "Security Treaty".
　　The Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party announced the "Outline for Revising the Japan-US Security Treaty" on April 8. This outline clearly shows that the Nobusuke Kishi group is determined to further sell out Japanese sovereignty and national interests according to American demands. According to the outline, the "Security Treaty" after the revision will not only not change the basic nature of the original treaty, but will further drag Japan into the US military aggression system, making Japan act as an accomplice in US aggression in Asia. The outline stipulates that the US military "can use Japanese facilities and areas", which makes the long-term occupation of Japan by the US military legal. The outline also uses the method of superficially raising Japan's equal status in the treaty to make Japan bear more military obligations. For example, the United States has the obligation to "defend" Japan, and Japan must also "complete the tasks that should be completed within the scope allowed by national strength and the constitution". In fact, it means that the United States wants to support Japanese militarism and rearm Japan, so that Japan can become the US strategic base in Asia; Japan must actively strengthen the military power of potential imperialism, so as to serve the United States when the United States launches an aggressive offensive. Of course, the US-Japanese reactionaries are eager to make further military collusion, each with their own plans. The United States is eager to drag Japan into the water and let Japan take the lead for the United States and retreat to the second line, because it has repeatedly failed in personally fighting in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait; the Nobusuke Kishi group is attempting to revive Japanese militarism and suppress domestic peace and democratic forces with the help of the United States, to realize its ambitions for foreign expansion. The Nobusuke Kishi group is attempting to play a trick to deceive and incorporate Okinawa Island into the "joint defense area" with the United States, and use this strategic island as a base to organize a Northeast Asian aggression group; and doing so is precisely to prepare conditions for its aggression and expansion. In order to maintain its precarious reactionary rule, the Nobusuke Kishi group does not hesitate to collude with US imperialism to suppress its own people. The outline shows that the US military can intervene in Japan's internal affairs and suppress the Japanese people's movement according to the Japanese government's request. The United States can also take arbitrary actions against Japan on the pretext of helping to stop "indirect aggression". This is actually paving the way for the United States to accelerate the fascistization of Japan and for the United States to further interfere in Japan's internal affairs.
　　The Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party's "Outline for Revising the Japan-US Security Treaty" fully exposes the Nobusuke Kishi group's conspiracy to willingly betray the country and act as an accomplice in US aggression. It will inevitably incite the Japanese people to launch a larger-scale struggle. The Japanese people, who have long insisted on getting rid of American control and striving for national independence, will never allow the US-Japanese reactionaries to lead the Japanese nation to the road of war and destruction.

　　半月国际述评
　　（四月一日到十五日）
    西方的逆流和分歧
    由于东西方外长会议不久将在日内瓦召开，而举行最高级会议的可能性也较前增长，现在人们有理由希望和要求各国政治家们循此方向，继续努力，以促使冷战冰河解冻的时期早日到来。
    但如果以这个要求来衡量西方阵营各国政府领导人的态度的话，那是很难使人满意的。看起来，在已经变化了的形势面前，西方国家仍然想坚持它们过时了的政策，这一点可以在4月初北大西洋公约组织理事会华盛顿会议上得到证明。
    在这次“庆祝”北大西洋集团十周年的为时三天的会议上，除了照例吹擂一番已经破绽百出的帝国主义集团之间的“团结”“合作”之外，主要就是讨论了柏林问题和德国问题。据西方通讯社报道，会议作出的决定是：在行将到来的东西方外长会议上，西方国家将“不提出对德和约草案”，“不接受任何类型的两个德国的邦联”，并且认为柏林问题和“冻结”军备问题都是跟德国统一问题有“密切联系”的，而实现德国统一的“最后步骤包括自由选举”在内。不用说，这种所谓“一揽子”计划的目的，就是要把目前已经时机成熟了的柏林问题和对德和约问题都跟完全不现实的德国统一问题纠缠起来，首先阻挠和约的缔结和西柏林占领制度的结束，然后再把德国的统一推向遥远的未来。把有条件可以解决的局部问题淹没在无法一起同时解决的总体里边，这是西方国家阻挠解决悬而未决的重大国际问题的一贯伎俩。前些时候，只是迫于苏联建议和世界舆论的强大压力，西方国家才不得不假惺惺地表示要采取所谓“灵活”态度来遮掩世人的耳目。但当它们因为东西方外长会议真的日益临近而被迫摊牌的时候，却又顾不得暴露自己的真面目，而仍然乞灵于老一套的僵硬政策和拖延手法了。更值得注意的是，一些西方军事首脑如诺斯塔德和麦克耳罗伊之流，最近又在不断发出战争叫嚣，毒化国际气氛。对于国际局势中的这一股逆流，人们是丝毫也不能放松警惕的。
    但是，在另一方面还应该看到，西方国家企图坚持占领西柏林的非法权利和阻挠德国问题合理解决的这种一致，并不能掩盖它们之间的分歧。问题在于，日内瓦会议和华盛顿会议不同，在众目睽睽之下的日内瓦东西方外长会议上，西方国家要想简单地用一个“不”字来对付一切是不可能的。而究竟用什么办法来既拖延实质问题的解决而又能推诿自己的责任，逃避世人的指责，甚至改善一下目前所处的困境，这一点在西方国家内部现在还莫衷一是。目前的这种分歧，特别表现在英国和西德关系的矛盾上。英国由于它自身的政治和经济利益，目前倾向于在柏林问题和德国问题上求得一种权宜的“妥协”办法，并愿意目前的僵局出现某种“松动”。尽管英国在华盛顿会议上受到美国的压力而从原来的立场倒退了一些，但是并不能说英国现在就不准备再按着它自己的方向继续行动了。继麦克米伦之后，英国元帅蒙哥马利也宣布要到苏联去访问了。英国的这种动向，招来了西德的极度不满。西德政府反对在德国问题上发生任何变化，深恐“牵一发而动全身”，危及整个西德统治集团的地位和重新武装的反动政策。由于在这种政治分歧的背后还隐藏着英国的“自由贸易区”和以西德为主的“小欧洲”“共同市场”的经济矛盾，现在英国和西德之间的明争暗斗已经愈演愈烈。英国和西德矛盾在西方阵营中已占着十分突出的地位，并成为西方国家在德国问题上求得最后一致的方案的一个重要障碍。据路透社报道，这种情况已引起了华盛顿的“深刻不安”。那里认为，距5月11日东西方外长会议的“时间不多了”，因此“必须尽最大的努力来消除意见上的分歧”。但它又说，那里对消除这种分歧的“前景的看法却是黯淡的”。
    在西德和英国的矛盾越来越尖锐的同时，西德统治集团内部的矛盾也在进一步发展，并趋向表面化了。在西德政府内一贯独断独行的阿登纳，最近由于他的党——基督教民主联盟的领导机构会议的决定，宣布即将放弃总理职务而要竞选总统了。实际上这是一种明升暗降。阿登纳的退职，反映了他所奉行的反对和平解决德国问题和缓和国际紧张局势的僵硬政策的不得人心。几年来，由于这种政策，阿登纳集团在西德越来越陷于孤立，在国际上也遭到了越来越多的谴责。这样发展下去显然会动摇基督教民主联盟的统治地位，而有在1961年大选中被它的对手西德社会民主党击败的危险。因此不顾阿登纳本人的反对，基督教民主联盟的领导机构就作出了要他退职的决定。虽然这并不等于西德政府现行政策的根本改变，但至少说明阿登纳原来这种极端顽固不化的政策是破产了。
    多年来，阿登纳一直是美国实力政策和冷战政策的坚决维护者。因此今天他的退职实际上也反映了美国侵略政策，特别是对德政策的失败。虽然阿登纳本人和美国的一些实力政策奉行者今天还想继续挣扎，用老一套的办法来阻挠整个国际局势缓和的趋向和重大问题的解决，但正如过去一样，事情显然是不会根据这些顽固派的主观愿望而发展的，他们愈是顽固不化，就必然会陷入愈加孤立、被动和困难的境地。
    关于阿拉伯国家之间的关系
    最近一个时期，阿拉伯国家之间的关系，引起人们的注意。
    3月底，阿联总统纳赛尔同黎巴嫩总统谢哈布曾举行会谈。虽然在会谈举行以前，黎巴嫩报纸“东方报”曾报道说：“阿拉伯联合共和国想要通过纳赛尔即将同黎巴嫩总统谢哈布的会谈来争取黎巴嫩支持它反对伊拉克”，但最后发表的会谈公报并没有提到阿伊或者黎伊关系问题。贝鲁特大部分报刊都认为这次会谈重新肯定了黎巴嫩的独立和它对各个阿拉伯国家保持中立。“呼声报”指出，“黎巴嫩人民十分关心中立政策，而且关心不让任何人利用黎巴嫩作为向其他阿拉伯国家发动进攻的基地”。
    4月2日到7日，阿拉伯联盟政治委员会在黎巴嫩首都召开了阿拉伯国家外交部长会议。据消息报道，这次会议原来建议的议程是：“阿联和伊拉克关系的现状，这个现状所产生的对于阿拉伯团结的危险性以及改变这种状况的方法”。会议进行了六天，并发表了一个公报。由于对所讨论的问题没有得到具体的结果，所以公报宣布委员会处于“长期开会的状态”。苏丹代表最后拒绝在会议的公报上签字，因为他认为，公报的某些条款是他的国家所不能同意的。苏丹外长4月15日表示，苏丹拒绝干涉伊拉克的内政，并且不受贝鲁特会议所通过的决议的约束。
    贝鲁特会议的召开本来是由于苏丹的建议，而在开罗决定的，据说是为了“调解”阿联和伊拉克之间的“紧张关系”。但是与历次阿拉伯联盟政治委员会的会议不一样，在联盟的十个成员国中，只有阿联、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯、黎巴嫩、也门、苏丹等六个国家出席了会议，而伊拉克拒绝参加，突尼斯、利比亚、约旦也没有派代表参加。
    伊拉克不同意参加会议。巴格达电台4月3日的评论指出，目前的“问题不是一个不为伊拉克接受的调解问题，因为伊拉克尊重阿拉伯联盟，忠实地执行阿拉伯团结政策，它没有干涉过阿拉伯国家的任何事务。”而问题是伊拉克遭到外国的“干涉和侵略”。利比亚政府则认为，由于伊拉克没有参加会议，因此它拒绝参加会议。突尼斯执政党机关报“行动报”在评论中指出，突尼斯拒绝参加会议，“是想避免毫无目的的争论”。
    根据阿拉伯国家报纸的报道，出席这次会议的多数阿拉伯国家的代表团显然不愿意干涉伊拉克的内政，危害阿拉伯国家之间的团结和正常关系。摩洛哥首席代表阿卜杜拉·易卜拉欣在谈到阿联代表对伊拉克的指责时认为，仅仅听取一方的说明是不合理的，特别是因为阿联也曾经一度遭到过同样的指责，但事实证明，这些指责是没有根据的。这位摩洛哥的首相兼外交大臣在答复“东方报”记者的问题时说：“我不想站在一个阿拉伯国家方面来反对另外一个阿拉伯国家”。据贝鲁特“建设报”报道，摩洛哥、苏丹和沙特阿拉伯的代表说，假如伊拉克公开违背阿拉伯联盟宪章，并损害阿拉伯团结，那么联盟就有权谴责伊拉克。但是他们指出，伊拉克在控诉有人干涉它的内政，并指责阿联制造了摩苏尔叛乱。沙特阿拉伯代表费萨尔亲王在回答黎巴嫩报纸记者的问题时说：“阿拉伯国家组成了一个大家庭，在这个家庭里，每个阿拉伯国家都独立地生活在一个房间里，并且它有权利在它自己的房子里做它所喜欢做的事情”。
    开罗“金字塔报”采访会议的记者说，“要在贝鲁特会议上作出反对伊拉克的大胆决定，看来那是困难的”。贝鲁特“今天报”指出，“纳赛尔的代表感觉到，他已陷于孤立，因此他变得有些激动了”。
    日本人民要求摆脱美国控制争取民族独立
    日本人民阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的运动，正在全国各地深入扩展。目前，日本许多县份已成立了联合斗争组织，普遍展开反对日美“安全条约”的宣传活动。拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会和中立性工会，也以争取废除“安全条约”为中心要求，继续组织春季斗争的全国统一行动。4月15日，日本人民在一百四十多个团体组成的“阻止修改日美安全条约国民会议”的号召下，举行了“为废除安全条约和阻止修改安全条约全体人民统一行动日”。在许多县和地区，举行了县民大会、地区大会和工作场所大会；东京的学生还对日本首相岸信介举行了集体请愿。
    日本人民反对日美“安全条约”运动的迅速扩展表明，日本要求摆脱美国控制、争取民族独立的人们已越来越多，现在不仅广大日本劳动人民、知识分子和中、小资产阶级踊跃参加这个斗争，连日本统治机构的一部分人，也表示要保卫和平和国家独立。只有岸信介政府，非但无视于广大日本人民摆脱美国控制、维护国家主权的要求；相反的，还企图通过同美国政府修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，来粉饰和加强这条奴役日本民族的锁链。
    日本政府和自由民主党4月8日发表了“修改日美安全条约纲要”。这个纲要清楚地表明，岸信介集团决心根据美国要求，进一步出卖日本主权和民族利益。按照纲要，修改以后的“安全条约”，不仅不会改变原条约的基本性质，而且将进一步把日本拖入美国的军事侵略体系，使日本充当美国侵略亚洲的帮凶。纲要规定美军
  “可以使用日本的设施和区域”，这就使美军的长期占领日本成为合法。纲要还利用表面上提高日本在条约中的对等地位的手法，使日本承担更多的军事义务。譬如，美国有“保卫”日本的义务，日本也要根据“国家力量和宪法允许的范围内完成应当完成的任务”。实际上就是：美国要扶植日本军国主义、重新武装日本，使日本成为美国在亚洲的战略基地；日本要积极加强潜在帝国主义的军事力量，以待美国发动侵略攻势时为美国效劳。当然，美日反动派所以急于作进一步的军事勾结，是各有自己的打算的。美国是因为在中近东和台湾海峡地区亲自上阵连遭失败，亟图拖日本下水，替美国顶头阵，而自己退居第二线；岸信介集团则企图凭借美国的帮助，复活日本军国主义，镇压国内的和平民主力量，实现它对外扩张的野心。岸信介集团企图耍弄欺骗手法把冲绳岛划入同美国的“共同防御地区”，以这个战略岛屿为据点，组织东北亚侵略集团；而这样做，也正是为它进行侵略扩张准备条件。岸信介集团为了维持它岌岌可危的反动统治，不惜勾结美帝国主义镇压本国人民。纲要表明美军可以根据日本政府要求，干涉日本内政，镇压日本人民运动。美国还可以以帮同制止“间接侵略”为借口，对日本任意采取行动。这实际是为美国的加速日本法西斯化、为美国进一步干涉日本内政开辟了道路。
    日本政府和自由民主党的“修改日美安全条约纲要”，充分暴露了岸信介集团甘心丧权辱国、充当美国侵略帮凶的阴谋。它必将激起日本人民展开更大规模的斗争。长期以来坚持要求摆脱美国控制、争取民族独立的日本人民，决不会听任美日反动派把日本民族引向战争毁灭的道路。
