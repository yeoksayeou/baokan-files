On Anti-Aging and Strengthening the Body
Speech by Committee Member Shi Jinmo

Mr. Chairman, fellow committee members, and comrades in the medical field:

Our motherland has achieved brilliant accomplishments that have shaken the world on the path of building socialism. As an old soldier on the medical and health front, I am encouraged by the soaring enthusiasm of 600 million people and would like to present to the congress the scientific basis, social foundation, and medical plan for anti-aging and strengthening the body.

I. On the Scientific Basis of Anti-Aging and Strengthening the Body

Humans have developed over an extremely long history to become the most excellent, intelligent, and advanced material above all things, becoming human beings. The length of human lifespan is not fixed and immutable. It varies depending on innate heredity and acquired living environment and healthcare conditions. As a creature among living things, humans also undergo metabolic changes like other organisms. Our proposal for anti-aging and strengthening the body is by no means a fantasy of immortality, because there is birth and therefore there must be death. Attempting to live forever violates the objective laws of metabolism. Therefore, there are only myths of immortality in history, and no real people who live forever. We also do not believe in fatalism, saying that the length of human life is predetermined. Our proposal for anti-aging and strengthening the body is based on the scientific argument that humans can achieve a lifespan of over a hundred years in generally good living environments and healthcare conditions. The Soviet academic community has conducted research on human lifespan and reached the scientific conclusion that "everyone can live to an average of one hundred and fifty years." Ancient China also regarded a hundred years as a medium lifespan (see Annotations to Poems in Wen Xuan, quoting from the Classic of Nourishing Life). The oldest Chinese medical classic, the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic, states: "People in ancient times all lived over a hundred years without declining in activity." It also says: "The Dao can reverse aging and preserve the form" (both from On Innocent Antiquity). The longevity of people in ancient times refers to the classless primitive society. The Dao refers to the Dao of mastering medicine and health preservation. Ancient Chinese masters who were proficient in medicine often lived to be over a hundred years old. The Biography of Hua Tuo in the Book of the Later Han states: Tuo was "nearly a hundred years old, yet still had a youthful appearance." Hua Tuo's disciple, Fan A, "lived over a hundred years." The Biography of Sun Simiao in the Old Book of Tang states: Simiao was over a hundred years old, "his vision and hearing were not diminished, and his spirit was very vigorous." This proves that human life should generally reach over a hundred years. Many Chinese place names are prefixed with the character for longevity (寿), and children are often named with 百岁 (hundred years). This proves that longevity is not only people's desire, but also the natural lifespan that humans should attain. Dying before the age of one hundred should be considered a premature death. Short lifespans are caused by various damages to the body. If the body is not damaged and receives proper care, living to be over a hundred years old is not difficult at all. However, all methods of anti-aging and strengthening the body can only be fully realized under a new social system, a socialist society.

II. On the Social Foundation of Anti-Aging and Strengthening the Body

Humans live in a specific society. The living environment, lifestyle, and living standards change and develop with social changes and development. In class-oppressed societies, millions of oppressed people often have short lifespans. Because class oppression is the root cause of natural disasters, man-made calamities, poverty, disease, and death. Even if there are miraculous techniques for health preservation and prolonging life, they cannot be promoted among millions of people who are hungry, cold, hateful, and harmful to each other. "It is rare for a person to live to seventy since ancient times," this idiom is perfectly appropriate in class-oppressed societies. But when classes are eliminated, in a socialist society, the situation completely changes. Fifty or sixty years ago, Kang Youwei, an advanced figure in China's Reform Movement, already mentioned in his book "Datong Shu" that in the Datong world, due to social evolution, medical evolution, and improved healthcare conditions for human life, everyone would live at least one or two hundred years. Kang Youwei guessed this issue correctly.

Currently, under the wise and great leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, 600 million people in our country are advancing towards the path of socialism with heroic strides. On the basis of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, people's communes have been universally established throughout the country. First, 600 million people have found the law of leaping from a yield of over a hundred jin per mu to several thousand jin, several ten thousand jin, and several hundred thousand jin in terms of grain production increase. Having found this law, a series of laws for changing the entire social landscape and the laborers themselves have naturally been found. This naturally puts forward a new requirement on the medical and health front: changing post-illness treatment to pre-illness health preservation, changing decline to strength, changing old age to childhood, so that every Chinese person who loves socialism and communism, every Chinese person who happily labors for the cause of socialism, can both give full play to their talents and live out their full lifespan. This arduous and glorious task cannot but fall on the shoulders of medical and health workers across the country.

In the ten years since liberation, medical and health workers across the country, especially traditional Chinese medicine workers, have continuously tapped their potential under the care and guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, and have achieved remarkable achievements in both medical treatment and healthcare, but they are still far behind the great harvests on the agricultural front. Grain production can leap to a thousand or hundred times more, why can't people who have developed as advanced material, as new people in the socialist era, find the law of transforming, changing, continuously leaping forward, and rejuvenating their own lives? The question lies in whether we dare and can take active and effective methods and measures.

III. On the Medical Plan for Anti-Aging and Strengthening the Body

In recent years, the medical community at home and abroad has been studying the art of reversing aging. In my humble opinion, people can only grasp and apply the objective laws of metabolism, take active measures to cultivate new and vigorous functions to replace old and declining functions, and achieve the effect of prolonging life from this.

Our ancestors accumulated rich experience in health preservation and prolonging life in history, mainly divided into two categories: using techniques and using medicine. Techniques and medicine are used separately, and when used properly and persistently, they can achieve the effect of anti-aging and strengthening the body; when techniques and medicine are used together, the effect is even more rapid. There are many types of techniques, the most famous are static exercises such as breathing exercises and guiding exercises, and dynamic exercises such as Yi Jin Jing, Xi Sui Jing, Wuqinxi, and Taijiquan. The combination of movement and stillness has significant effects and has been passed down through the generations. If needed, you can visit and refer to them. However, I am an outsider to this, and what this plan wants to propose is not the use of techniques but the use of medicine.

Under the socialist system, everyone lives a life of abundance, happy labor, happy learning, and entertainment. Xunzi's saying "beautiful intentions prolong life" can only be realized in such a society. However, the imbalance of yin and yang, cold and heat, the immoderation of daily life and diet, and the erosion of various harmful bacteria can all damage the body. Therefore, mankind must continue to fight against various natural disasters and diseases. Therefore, to enable everyone to give full play to their talents and live out their full lifespan, we still need to rely on medical and health work. Chinese medicine is the result of the long-term struggle of thousands of generations of working people against various natural disasters and diseases. However, there are many types of Chinese medicine, so we must choose carefully and use them flexibly. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, alchemists have used gold and stones to refine pills, calling them elixirs. Throughout history, emperors who died from swallowing so-called elixirs are numerous. Gold and stones, after prolonged calcination, are extremely dry and hot and cannot be melted by flesh and blood organs. These types of medicines must never be tried on the human body again.

In an era when mankind has not yet fully controlled nature, people generally begin to experience decline after the age of forty or fifty. To resist aging and rejuvenate, we must adopt the method of continuous fertilization and topdressing for agricultural production, supplementing and nourishing the body's new life functions, mainly by tonifying and consolidating essence and qi, and protecting the internal organs. As long as the essence and qi are not dispersed and the internal organs are not damaged, there is no reason to die before the natural lifespan is exhausted; even if the life force is exhausted, one can also die without illness. This is entirely possible in the new society.

I have personally experienced the dark days of the old society, and I am nearly eighty years old, fortunately my mind has not completely deteriorated. But my life is finite, and I must be mindful. I have looked forward to the newborn motherland, I love the rich heritage of the motherland for more than two thousand years, I love the motherland's leap forward to socialism today, I look forward to the motherland's transition to communism tomorrow, and I cherish even more the achievements already obtained in medical treatment and healthcare by the national medical and health workers who are fortunate enough to be in the same prosperous age as me. Adding my own insignificant clinical experience of decades, I have more carefully considered the various effective secret prescriptions of our predecessors, raising the closed effect already obtained by our predecessors to actively topdressing, cultivating new functions, and developing new and more vigorous life forces. Based on this principle, I have created one main and one auxiliary prescription for tonifying and consolidating essence and qi; one main and one auxiliary prescription for protecting the internal organs; and for the convenience of the general public, I have created a comprehensive and simplified prescription. After preliminary tests, it has been proven that the medicinal power is abundant and gentle, with no adverse reactions at all. Elderly people taking it can gradually make new changes in their bodies, turning illness into health, and turning decline into strength. I plan to dedicate these five prescriptions to the motherland as a gift to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the National Day. I would like to submit this medical plan and some of my superficial views on this issue to the congress, and ask the congress to forward it to the health department for review and decision. I hope to receive guidance from leaders at all levels, experts from all parties, and comrades who care about this matter, and that everyone will work together to further promote the excellent traditions of Chinese medicine, further exert the positive role of medical and health work, so that the motherland's medical and health work can reach the highest international level, and that 600 million people can further increase their infinite potential in terms of physical fitness, and further increase their happy and healthy life. This is my long-cherished wish. Detailed explanations of the five prescriptions, medicinal ingredients, preparation methods, dosage, curative effects, and some theoretical bases of this plan are available separately. I will not list them one by one here.

专栏：

    论抗老强身
    施今墨委员的发言主席、各位委员、各位医药工作的同志们：
    祖国在建设社会主义的道路上取得了震动全世界的光辉成就。我以一个医药卫生战线上的老兵，被六亿人民的冲天干劲所鼓舞，谨向大会提出关于抗老强身的科学根据、社会基础和医药方案。
    一、关于抗老强身的科学根据
    人类是经过极其长远的发展历史形成为超万物之上的最优秀、最灵明、最高级的物质而成为人。关于人类寿命的长短，原不是固定不变的。他是随着先天的遗传和后天的生活环境、保健条件而各有所不同。人类既为生物中的一物，他也和一般生物同样地有新陈代谢的变化作用。我们提出抗老强身，绝不是幻想长生不老，因为有生必有死，企图长生不老，是违反新陈代谢的客观规律的。所以历史上只有长生不老的神话，绝无长生不老的真人。我们也绝不相信宿命论，说什么：人类寿命长短各有命定。我们提出抗老强身，是从科学上论证人类在一般良好的生活环境和保健条件下生活，都可以得到百年以上的长寿。苏联学术界研究人类寿命作出科学的结论说：“每人平均都可以活到一百五十岁”。中国古代也以百年为中寿（见文选诗注引养生经）。中国最古的一部医学经典黄帝内经说：“上古之人，春秋皆度百岁而动作不衰”。又说：“夫道者能却老而全形”（均见上古天真论）。所谓上古之人长寿，是指无阶级压迫的原始社会。所谓道，是指精通医药摄生的道。中国古代精通医药的大师，享年多在百岁以上。后汉书华佗传说：佗“年且百岁，而犹有壮容”。华佗弟子樊阿，“寿百余岁”。旧唐书孙思邈传说：思邈年在百岁以上，“视听不衰，神采甚茂”。足证人类寿命，本应普遍活到百岁以上。中国地名，多冠寿字，儿童取名，多称百岁。足证长寿不仅是人们的愿望，而寿满百龄，也是人类应得的天年。未满百年而死，都应该说是夭折短命。短命，是身体受到了各种损害，如果不受损害，得到应有的保养，普遍活到百岁以上，绝不是难事。但一切抗老强身的方法，必须在新的社会制度，社会主义的社会，才能完全实现。
    二、关于抗老强身的社会基础
    人类生活在一定的社会中。生活环境，生活方式，生活水平，不能不随着社会的变化而变化、社会的发展而发展。在阶级压迫的社会里，千百万被压迫的人民，常常是短命的。因为阶级压迫，就是造成天灾、人祸、贫穷、疾病、死亡的根源。纵有保健延生的妙术，也无法推行到千千万万啼饥号寒、互相仇视、互相残害的人民中间。“人生七十古来稀”，这句成语，用在阶级压迫的社会里，是完全恰当的。但到了阶级消灭、到了社会主义的社会，情况就完全改变了。五、六十年前，中国变法维新的先进人物康有为在他所著的大同书里，已经谈到：到了大同世界，由于社会进化、医药进化、人类生活保健条件随之改善，每人最少都要活到一两百岁。这个问题，教康有为猜中了。
  当前我国六亿人民，在英明伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，正以英雄的步伐向着社会主义的道路前进。在一九五八年工农业大跃进的基础上，全国又普遍建立了人民公社。六亿人民，首先在粮食增产方面，找到了从亩产百余斤飞跃到几千斤、几万斤、几十万斤的规律。找到了这个规律，就一系列地找到了改变整个社会面貌和劳动者自身面貌的规律。这就自然在医药卫生战线上提出了一个新的要求：变事后医疗为事先保健预防，变衰退为强壮，变老年为童年，使每一个热爱社会主义、共产主义的中国人民，使每一个为社会主义事业而愉快劳动的中国人民，既能各尽其能，又能各尽其寿，这个艰巨而光荣的任务，就不能不落到全国医药卫生工作者的身上。
    解放后十年以来，全国医药卫生工作者特别是中医药工作者，在党和毛主席的爱护和指导下，不断发挥潜力，在医疗和保健方面，都获得了卓越的成就，但比农业战线上的大丰收，还远远不如。粮食增产，能飞跃到千百倍以上，为什么作为高级物质发展起来的人，作为社会主义时代的新人，关于自身的生命，不能找到改造、变化、不断跃进、返青的规律。问题就在敢不敢、能不能采取积极有效的办法和措施。
    三、关于抗老强身的医药方案
    近年以来，国内外医药界，都在研究返老还童的方术，以我粗浅的观察，人们只能掌握运用新陈代谢的客观规律，采取积极的措施，培养新的壮盛的机能，以代替旧的衰老的机能，从这里收到延年益寿的效果。
    我们先人在历史上积累了保健延生的丰富经验，主要分为用术与用药两大类。术与药分别运用，运用得当，持之以恒，均可收到抗老强身的效果；术与药并用，收效更为迅速。术的门类繁多，最著名的如吐纳导引等静功，易筋洗髓、五禽戏、太极拳等动功，动静结合，功效显著，历代都有传人，如有需要，可以访问援引。但我对此是门外汉，本方案所要提出的，不是用术而是用药。
    在社会主义的制度下，人人都过着丰衣足食、愉快劳动、愉快学习和娱乐的生活，荀子所谓“美意延年”，只有这种社会才会实现。但阴阳寒暑的失调，起居饮食的失节，各种有害细菌的侵蚀，均能损害身体，因此，人类仍须继续与各种自然灾害和疾病作斗争。所以要人人各尽其能、各尽其寿，仍须借助于医药卫生工作。中国医药，是千百代劳动人民长期与各种天灾疾病斗争的成果。但中药品目繁伙，必须审慎选择，灵活运用。秦汉以来的方士，多用金石矿物，烧炼成丸，号为仙丹，历代皇帝吞食所谓仙丹而死的，史不绝书。金石矿物，久经烧炼，燥烈异常，绝非血肉脏腑所能熔化。这类药品，绝不能再以人身作尝试。
    人类在未能完全控制自然的时代，一般年过四十、五十，就逐渐发生衰退现象。抗老返青，必须采取如农业增产不断积肥追肥的方式，补养自身新生的机能，主要在补固精气，保护脏腑。只要精气不散，脏腑不损，天年未尽，便无死理；即便生机已尽，也可无病而逝。这在新社会是完全可以作到的。
    我亲身经历过旧社会的黑暗时日，年近八十，神志幸未全衰。但吾生有涯，不可不念。我已盼到了新生的祖国，我热爱祖国两千多年的丰富遗产，热爱祖国向社会主义跃进的今天，憧憬祖国向共产主义过渡的明天，更珍视与吾同逢盛世的全国医药卫生工作者在医疗、保健方面已经获得的成绩，加上我渺小的一身几十年来临床的微末经验，更小心谨慎地斟酌了我们前人获有成效的各种秘方，从前人已经取得的封闭作用，再提高到积极追肥，培养新生机能，发展新的更壮盛的有生力量。本此原则，制就了补固精气的正副药方各一；保护脏腑的正副药方各一；更为了便利广大人民服用易于普及起见，制就综合简化的药方一。经过初步试验，证实药力充盛而温和，绝无反作用。老年人服用，可以使身体逐渐发生新的变化，变多病为健康，变衰退为强壮。我打算把这五个药方，献给祖国，作为庆祝国庆十周年的献礼。我把这个医药方案及关于这个问题的一些粗浅的见解，谨向大会提出来，并请大会转给卫生部门审查裁决。希望得到各级领导、各方专家及关心斯事的同志们的指导，大家共同努力，进一步发扬祖国医学的优良传统，进一步发挥医药卫生工作的积极作用，使祖国医药卫生工作达到国际的最高水平，使六亿人民，在体质方面，更增加无穷的潜力，在生活方面，更增加健康快乐的幸福，这是我多年来寐寤以求的愿望。关于这一方案的五个药方、药目、制法、服法、疗效及其理论上的一些根据，另有详细说明。这里不再一一声叙。
