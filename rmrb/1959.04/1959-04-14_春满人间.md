　　“Spring Fills the World”
　　Deng Chumin
    "Spring Fills the World" is a new film recently started by the Shanghai Tianma Film Studio. It uses the rescue of Qiu Cai Kang as its subject matter and stars comrades such as Bai Yang. When I visited, it was the second day of filming. The scene of the Party Secretary walking out of the ward and reporters eagerly inquiring about the injury took a full two hours to shoot. In the evening, I composed a poem.

　　In this spring city, flowers fly everywhere,
　　“Spring Fills the World,” it's no exaggeration,
　　Such a fine film is now being shot,
　　The mercury lamps release colorful clouds.

　　The film set is like a hospital,
　　The artistic practice and work ethic are doubly commendable.
　　Here, it is filled with the breath of youth,
　　Here, the sparks of life are burning.

　　Preparing a new film to welcome National Day,
　　This is a unique and splendid flower of the motherland!
　　Let us sing in unison of spring filling the world,
　　Let the song overflow to the ends of the earth!

　　“春满人间”
　　邓初民
    “春满人间”，是上海天马电影制片厂最近开拍的新片。以抢救丘财康为题材，由白杨等同志主演。我去参观时，正是开拍的第二天，拍党委书记走出病房，记者们急切询问伤病情况的镜头，整整花了两小时的工夫。晚间，得诗一首。
　　春城无处不飞花，
　　“春满人间”信非夸，
　　如此佳片正开拍，
　　水银灯放出彩霞。
　　摄影场，医院化，
　　艺术实践、劳动态度倍可嘉。
　　这里充满着青春气息，
　　这里燃烧着生命火花。
　　准备新片迎国庆，
　　这是祖国的异彩奇葩！
　　齐声歌唱春满人间，
　　让歌声洋溢海角天涯！
