Speech by Committee Member Tao Shuzeng

Presidium, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan, the government work report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, and the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I guarantee to do everything in my power to fulfill the tasks on the economic and cultural and educational fronts in 1959.

I would now like to offer my immature opinions on several issues concerning the development of industry in the people's communes.

Under the inspiration of the general line of building socialism, and in accordance with the policy of walking on two legs, the people's communes will vigorously develop industry, and are already vigorously developing industry. The industries already established by the people's communes include not only agricultural product processing and industries that directly serve agriculture, but also heavy industries such as iron and steel, coal, and non-ferrous metals. In the situation where large, medium, and small-sized enterprises are developing simultaneously, the following questions will naturally arise: Which industries are suitable for operation by the people's communes? Which industries are suitable for operation by production teams based on the former advanced agricultural production cooperatives? In the past, Enshi Prefecture in Hubei Province experienced disputes between cooperatives and the county over opening coal mines and purchasing raw materials for papermaking. At that time, agricultural cooperatives mainly engaged in agricultural production and operated very few industries, so these kinds of conflicts were not numerous and were easily resolved. After the people's communes were established, many state-owned enterprises were decentralized to the communes, and conflicts between state-owned and privately-owned enterprises would no longer occur. However, the strength of the people's communes is limited after all, and the question of which industries can be decentralized and which are not suitable for decentralization should still be resolved. As for the relationship between the commune and the production team, if the scope of operation is not clear, conflicts will inevitably arise. Although both commune-run and team-run enterprises are collectively owned, and conflicts are still easy to resolve, production will inevitably be affected to some extent during the process from the occurrence of a conflict to its resolution.

I believe that the division of the scope of industrial production should be considered from three aspects:

First, classify by type of industry. Industries suitable for decentralized operation should be operated by the people's communes; industries suitable for centralized and large-scale operation should be operated by the state. Generally speaking, the production cost of large-scale factories is lower. However, if the transportation costs for concentrating raw materials and distributing finished products are added to the cost, it can be seen that not all industries are suitable for large-scale centralized operation. For example, the oil extraction industry is an industry suitable for decentralized operation. Farmers need edible vegetable oil, and even more so, they need vegetable oil cake as fertilizer and feed. Decentralizing the oil extraction industry to be operated by the people's communes can greatly save transportation capacity and reduce the cost of cake fertilizer. The oil extraction industry, like other agricultural product processing industries, can also be carried out during the agricultural slack season to balance agricultural production labor. Most of the processing industries for agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and local and special products are suitable for decentralized operation, and operation by the people's communes is even more effective. The textile industries such as cotton, hemp, and silk have higher prices for raw materials and finished products, and production is not restricted by seasons, so they are suitable for centralized operation.

Second, the same type of industry should be classified according to the size of resource reserves. Surface and underground resources with large reserves in an area should be operated by the state, and those with small reserves should be operated by the people's communes. For example, if large coalfields are mined by many communes and teams in different ways, it will result in a majority of water-collecting and abandoned wells, which can easily cause water penetration accidents, and will prevent a large amount of coal from being mined. If small ore deposits are operated by the state, management will be very inconvenient. State operation of large coalfields can invest more funds in capital construction and reduce production costs. Commune operation of small blocks of ore deposits can facilitate management. The forestry industry can also be divided into state-owned or commune-owned according to the size of the forest area.

Third, for the same industry, divide the work according to the production process. For industries where raw materials are bulky, production areas are scattered, and are suitable for centralized manufacturing, small factories can be operated by communes or production teams to concentrate raw materials within a small range to make semi-finished products. The semi-finished products are then concentrated in state-owned factories to be made into finished products. For example, the bark of the *gaoshu* tree produced in the western Hubei mountainous area is the raw material for making high-grade paper. The *gaoshu* trees grow scattered along the river, on the edges of fields, around houses, and along roadsides. It is laborious to concentrate the bark and the price is very low, so farmers are unwilling to sell the raw materials and will only sell the leather paper they have made. It is indeed a waste to use high-grade fiber to make low-grade paper. If the production teams of the commune are allowed to make the *gaoshu* bark into coarse pulp, and then concentrate it to state-owned paper mills to refine it into high-grade paper, the farmers will be willing to do it because they will get a larger income, and the raw materials will not be wasted. The loss of tonnage of ships and boats caused by transporting *longxucao* grass from Jun County, Hubei to Hankou for papermaking, and transporting reeds from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to Tianjin for papermaking every year is a considerable amount, and the cost of paper is also increased as a result. If pulp is made on the spot and then transported, these losses can be avoided. In the sugar industry, crude sugar can also be made in sugarcane or sugar beet producing areas and then concentrated for refining, which not only saves transportation capacity, but also avoids a large amount of raw material loss.

The communization of urban people may be realized in the near future. The production of urban people's communes is naturally mainly industry. Handicraft and semi-handicraft industries should be operated by communes. Industries that use small machinery and tools for production, such as the manufacture of small parts and accessories for machinery, and the manufacture of general instruments, etc.

Clearly defining the scope of industries directly operated by the people's communes and industries operated by production teams is a matter that urgently needs attention. Relying on the people's communes to develop small-scale industry mainly relies on the strength and enthusiasm of the production teams. Therefore, small-scale industry should be mainly operated by production teams. Only in this way can the potential of rural manpower and material resources be fully utilized. The division of the scope of commune-run and team-run industries should be based on resource distribution, transportation conditions, the size of manpower and material resources, and the coordination of main and sideline occupations. The commune can allocate a portion of its members to specialize in industry and engage in long-term industrial production. The production team takes industry as a sideline and engages in seasonal industrial production. Many products in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries need to be processed locally and immediately. For example, fish must be processed while they are fresh, and small processing plants should be set up in fishing villages along rivers and lakes and on fishing boats going out to sea for processing. This type of small factory will exist for a long time. Residents in mountainous areas are scattered, and there will also be this type of small factory that exists for a long time.

The industries mentioned above that are currently suitable for decentralized operation and suitable for operation by the people's communes are not all absolutely and permanently required to be decentralized. For example, the oil extraction industry is generally suitable for decentralized operation, but in the plain river network area, where the planting area of ​​oil crops is concentrated and shipping is very convenient, the state can also establish large-scale oil extraction plants at appropriate locations. These large factories have low production costs and high product quality, and are suitable for the production of goods for foreign trade. With the development of the comprehensive utilization industry of crops, vegetable oil cake has changed from a low-priced fertilizer to a raw material for various high-priced chemical industry products. At that time, the oil extraction industry will become a comprehensive industry, suitable for large-scale centralized operation.

The specific arrangements for the operation of industry by counties, people's communes, and production teams should be based on resource distribution, combined with population distribution, political divisions, transportation, and other conditions for comprehensive consideration. It is not conducive from the perspective of economic development to transport raw materials and fuels from afar to run industry, or to mobilize a large amount of manpower to go to distant places to run industry based on raw materials.

At present, the difficulty for people's communes in running industry on a large scale lies not in manpower and financial resources, but in the backwardness of technology. Farmers do not have much experience in running industry, and they urgently need technical guidance that can be immediately put into practice. Various business departments, research institutions, and science and technology associations have done a lot of work in industrial production technical guidance, which has played a certain role in the development of small-scale industrial production. But it is still far from keeping up with the requirements of the objective situation. I believe that in the future, research and guidance should be combined for small-scale industrial construction and production. Technical experts and skilled workers should organize research and guidance teams, go down to the communes, and under the leadership of the commune Party committee, jointly study with the commune members participating in industry to solve the technical problems that occur in capital construction and production. The combination of mass wisdom, scientific theory, and operating skills, and the simultaneous use of hands, brains, and mouths, can produce technical documents that are both in line with scientific theory and easy for the masses to practice through the process of practice, summary, re-practice, and re-summary. Indigenous methods of production are by no means a simplification of so-called foreign methods of production. There are many special problems in indigenous methods of production that are not encountered in foreign methods of production, and therefore cannot be easily solved by experts familiar with foreign methods of production. Solving these types of problems requires a scientific theoretical basis and may also allow certain scientific theories to be developed. It is a one-sided understanding to think that indigenous methods of production are not highly scientific or technical.

For more than 26,000 people's communes to universally run industry on a large scale, technical guidance must keep up, and a two-pronged approach is needed in the work of popularizing and improving science and technology. In addition to government industrial departments and scientific research departments undertaking this task, the Science and Technology Association, which has six million members, must cooperate with business departments under the leadership of the Party to complete this great task. Specialized societies under the leadership of the Science and Technology Association must go all out and become active in great numbers. In the later period of the Great Leap Forward last year, the activities of specialized societies in some places were an exception. Not only did they not leap forward, but they also stagnated. That members of specialized societies were busy with their job responsibilities is one reason for the stagnation of some society activities, but the main reason is that they did not fully understand that the technical revolution movement also needs to walk on two legs, and did not well shoulder the responsibilities that mass science and technology organizations should shoulder.

Clarifying the scope of commune-run and production team-run industries, keeping up with technical guidance, and carrying out the technical revolution movement will surely allow the development of privately-run industry to keep pace with agricultural development. The high-speed development of privately-run industry will not only greatly increase the speed of our country's industrialization, but will also greatly increase the speed of our country's scientific and cultural development.

Finally, I would like to make a suggestion. It has become a national system for cadres to go to the countryside and factories to participate in production for one month each year. I suggest that the committee members of the science and technology community of this association strive to go down to the communes to participate in production early this year, and under the leadership of the commune Party committee, take time out of production labor to study the technical problems in production, and each person write a book on the results of their research.

### 怎样发展人民公社的工业  陶述曾委员的发言

专栏：

    怎样发展人民公社的工业
    陶述曾委员的发言主席团，各位委员：
    我完全同意李维汉副主席所作的政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，李富春副总理和李先念副总理所作的报告，并保证为实现一九五九年经济战线和文化、教育战线上的任务尽到一切力量。
    我现在仅就关于发展人民公社工业的若干问题提出个人不成熟的意见。
    在建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，按照两条腿走路的方针，人民公社将大办工业，并且已经在大办工业。人民公社已经举办的工业中不仅有农产品加工和直接为农业服务的工业，也有钢铁、煤炭、有色金属等重工业。在大中小型企业同时并举的情况下，很自然地就会产生这样的问题：哪些工业适于人民公社经营？哪些工业适于以过去高级农业生产合作社为基础的生产队经营？过去湖北恩施专区曾经发生过合作社与县争开煤矿，争购造纸原料的事情。当时农业合作社以农业生产为主，办工业的很少，这类矛盾不多，也很容易解决。人民公社化后，许多国营企业下放到公社，国营与民营之间不至再发生矛盾。但人民公社的力量毕竟有限，什么样的工业可以下放，什么样的工业不宜下放，也还是应该解决的问题。至于公社与生产队之间，如果经营范围不清，就难免发生矛盾。虽然无论社营队营都是集体所有，矛盾仍然容易解决，但由矛盾发生到矛盾解决的过程中，生产总会受到一定影响。
    我认为工业生产范围的划分应从三方面来考虑：
    第一，按工业种类划分。凡是适宜于分散经营的工业应由人民公社经营；适宜于集中大规模经营的工业应由国营。一般说来，大规模工厂生产成本较低。但把原料集中和成品分散的运输费用加在成本一起计算，就可以看出并不是所有的工业都适宜于大规模集中经营。例如榨油工业就是适宜于分散经营的工业。农民需要食用植物油，更需要植物油饼作肥料和饲料。榨油工业分散由人民公社经营，可以大量节省运输力，降低饼肥成本。榨油工业生产也和其它农产品加工工业一样，可以利用农闲进行，平衡农业生产的劳动力。农、林、畜、鱼、土特产品加工工业大部分是适于分散经营的，由人民公社经营更为有力。棉、麻、蚕丝等纺织工业，原料和成品的价格较高，生产又不受季节限制，宜于集中经营。
    第二，同一种工业按资源蕴藏量的大小划分。地面资源和地下资源在一个地区蕴藏量大的宜于国营，蕴藏量小的宜由人民公社经营。例如大片煤田如果由许多社队分途开采，将会造成多数集水废井，容易发生穿水事故，且会使大量的煤采不出来。小矿床如果由国营，管理很不方便。大片煤田由国家经营可以在基本建设上投较多的资金，降低生产成本。小块矿床由公社经营可以就便管理。森林工业也可以按林区大小分由国营或社营。
    第三，同一项工业，按工序分工。凡原料笨重，产地分散而又适于集中制造的工业，可以由公社或生产队办小型工厂，集中小范围内的原料制成半成品。再把半成品集中到国营工厂制成成品。例如鄂西山区所产的?树皮是造高级纸张的原料。?树是分散生长在水边、田边、屋边、路边的。?皮集中费工而价格又很低，农民为争取较大的收入，不肯出卖原料，要造成皮纸才出卖。用高级纤维制成低级纸，确是一种浪费。如果让公社的生产队把?皮制成粗纸浆。再集中到国营纸厂精制成高级纸，农民因为得到较大的收入而愿意干，原料也不至于被糟蹋了。湖北均县的龙须草运到汉口造纸，长江中下游的芦苇运到天津造纸，每年在运输上损失的车船吨位是一个可观的数目，纸的成本也因此加高不少。如果就地制成纸浆再起运，这些损失就能避免了。制糖工业也可以在甘蔗或糖萝卜产地制成粗糖再集中精制，不仅节省运力，也能避免大量的原料损失。
    城市人民公社化在不久的将来可能实现。城市人民公社生产自然是以工业为主。手工业和半手工业宜由公社经营。用小型机械工具生产的工业如机械的小零件和配件制造，一般性的仪表制造等。
    人民公社直接经营的工业和生产队经营的工业明确划分范围，是目前极须注意的问题。依靠人民公社发展小型工业，主要是依靠生产队的力量和积极性。因而小型工业应以生产队经营为主。这样才能够充分发挥农村人力、物力的潜力。社营与队营工业范围的划分要以资源分布、交通情况、人力物力的大小、主业与副业的配合为依据。公社可以划出一部分社员专搞工业，从事长年性的工业生产。生产队以工业为副业，从事季节性的工业生产。农、林、牧、副、渔各业中有许多产品是需要就地即时加工的。例如鱼类必须趁新鲜加工，沿江滨湖的渔村中和出海的渔船上都应设小型加工厂进行加工。这类小型工厂将是长期存在的。山区居民点分散，也将有这类长期存在的小型工厂。
    上述目前宜于分散经营，宜于人民公社经营的工业并不都是绝对永远要分散经营的。例如榨油工业，一般说来宜于分散经营，但在平原河网区域，油料作物生产面积集中，航运非常便利，国家也可以在适当地点设立大规模的榨油厂。这种大厂生产成本低，产品质量高，适合于对外贸易商品的生产。随着农作物综合利用工业的发展，植物油饼由低价格的肥料变成了多种高价格化学工业产品的原料，那时榨油工业将成为一种综合性的工业，适合于大规模集中经营了。
    对于县、人民公社和生产队经营工业的具体安排要以资源分布为基础，结合人口分布、政治区划、交通运输等条件全面考虑。从远处运原料、燃料来办工业，或动员大量人力到远处去就原料办工业，从发展经济观点上看都是不利的。
    目前人民公社大办工业，困难不在于人力和财力而在于技术的落后。农民办工业的经验不多，他们迫切需要能够马上实践的技术指导。各业务部门、研究机构、科学技术协会在工业生产技术指导方面做了不少的工作，对小型工业生产的发展起了一定的作用。但还远远赶不上客观形势的要求。我认为今后对小型工业建设和生产宜把研究和指导结合起来。技术专家和熟练工人组织研究指导小组，下到公社去，在公社党委的领导下与参加工业的社员共同研究，解决基本建设和生产中发生的技术问题。群众智慧、科学理论、操作技能三者结合，手、脑、口三者并用，通过实践、总结、再实践、再总结的过程得出来的总结才是既符合科学理论、又便于群众实践的技术文件。土法生产决不是所谓洋法生产的简易化。土法生产中有许多特殊问题不是洋法生产中所遇得到的，因而也就不是熟悉洋法生产的专家所能轻易解决的。解决这类问题需要科学理论根据，也可能使某些科学理论得到发展。认为土法生产的科学性、技术性不高是片面的认识。
    二万六千多个人民公社普遍大办工业，要使技术指导跟上去，在科学技术普及和提高工作上就需要两条腿走路。除政府工业部门、科学研究部门担负起这个任务外，拥有六百万会员的科学技术协会必须在党的领导下配合业务部门完成这个伟大任务。科协领导下专门学会必须鼓足干劲，风起云涌地活跃起来。在去年大跃进的后期有些地方的专门学会活动是例外，它们不仅没有跃进，相反地还停顿了。专门学会会员忙于岗位工作是部分学会活动停顿的原因之一，但主要原因还是对于技术革命运动也需要两条腿走路这一点认识不足，没有很好地负担起群众科技组织应负的责任。
    把公社经营工业、生产队经营工业的范围划清楚，技术指导跟上去，技术革命运动开展起来，民营工业的发展势将与农业发展并驾齐驱。民营工业的高速度发展，不仅将大大提高我们国家工业化的速度，也将大大提高我国科学文化发展的速度。
    最后，我提出一个建议。干部每年以一个月时间下乡、下厂参加生产已经成为国家的制度。我建议本会科技界委员们今年争取早下公社参加生产，在公社党委领导下，从生产劳动中挤出时间来研究生产中的技术问题，每人把研究成果写出一本书来。
