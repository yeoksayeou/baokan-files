　　Hunan Raises More Pigs and Accumulates More Manure
　　Yizhang Promotes Rapid High-Temperature Mud Creation Method
    (Our newspaper, Changsha, 17th dispatch) Hunan is taking measures to increase grain production by raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, vigorously developing the pig-raising industry. By mid-March of this year, the province had approximately 12 million pigs in stock, averaging more than one pig per household. According to farmers' many years of experience in raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, each pig can accumulate about 40 dan of fertilizer per year. Based on the current number of pigs in the province, it is estimated that about 500 million dan of fertilizer can be accumulated this year, with an average of about 10 dan of pig manure applied to each mu of paddy field in the province. This is of great significance for ensuring increased agricultural production throughout the province this year. With the development of pig raising, not only has the supply of non-staple foods in cities increased, but a large amount of concentrated fertilizer has also been added. Due to the development of pig raising in Changsha County, by the end of March, the county had collected more than 10.33 million dan of household fertilizer, an increase of more than threefold compared to the same period last year.
    This year, while implementing the policy of developing collective pig raising, various localities are also trying to support some commune members' families who have the conditions to raise pigs, in order to accelerate the development of the pig raising industry. After the Shuanggang Brigade of the Yanglousi People's Commune in Linxiang loaned more than 100 pigs to more than 110 commune members' families with the conditions to raise pigs, the total number of pigs in the brigade quickly increased from 1,000 to more than 1,300.
    In order to ensure that the fertilizer accumulated by pig raising can be well collected and applied to the fields, various localities have established household fertilizer collection systems and bonus methods for exceeding quotas. It is generally stipulated that about 15% of pig manure should be retained in the canteens to cultivate feed, and more than 80% of pig manure should be applied to the fields.
    (Our newspaper, Changsha, 17th dispatch) The people's communes in Yizhang County, Hunan Province, are universally promoting the rapid high-temperature mud creation method to accelerate the fermentation and decomposition of pig and cattle pen mud, and increase the accumulation of concentrated fertilizer.
    This method was successfully tested by Bai Dongchang, the branch secretary, and three commune members of the Xiabaijia Production Team of the Yiliu Commune in Yizhang County. The method is as follows: After all the pig and cattle pen mud is removed, sprinkle some lime on the bottom of the pen, then pad it with five or six handfuls of rice straw or thatch, and add some easily decomposed green grass and leaves. Before padding the straw every day, sprinkle human urine or sewage on the mud once a day, sprinkling and padding every day. In this way, the rice straw and pig manure will quickly start to decompose after being heated, accelerating the time for removing the mud. In the past, the mud was removed once every month or so, with 60 dan of mud removed each time. Now, it only takes seven to ten days to remove it once, and more than 150 dan of mud can be removed in a month. At the same time, the "three combinations" (combining buffalo manure with yellow cattle manure, combining cattle manure with pig manure, and combining dry grass with green grass) are adopted to promote the decomposition of cattle pen mud. After the cattle pen mud is removed, some urine and sewage are sprinkled, and then the method of making high-temperature compost is adopted. A cross-shaped small ditch is dug on the ground, a layer of firewood is laid on top, a layer of turf is placed on the firewood, cattle pen mud is placed on the turf, and turf or pond mud, ditch mud, and soil ash are placed on top of the mud. Then, a layer of cattle pen mud is placed, followed by a layer of turf mixed with pond mud, soil ash, etc., with tea seed cake powder added in the middle, and then another layer of cattle pen mud is placed. After stacking to six to seven feet, the outside is sealed with mud, and a bamboo tube is inserted in the middle. Human urine or ditch water tea seed cake water is poured into the bamboo tube once every day or two. In this way, after continuous fermentation, it can be used in five to seven days. If it is turned over every four to five days, it will become broken cattle pen mud in ten days, and the fertilizer efficiency will be more than 45% higher than in the past. Using this method, the team increased cattle pen mud by 2,275 dan in ten days.
    The Yizhang County Party Committee promptly promoted this method. On March 7, it specially held a broadcast conference to call on all communes, production teams, and work groups to universally promote this method, requiring that cattle and pig pens be managed by special personnel, and cattle and pig pen mud be padded and created by special personnel. Then, at the telephone conference of the Party Committee Secretaries of each commune, it was emphasized that special personnel should lead, and each commune was notified to send a Party Committee member and an old farmer to the Xiabaijia Team of the Yiliu Commune for a field visit. As a result, a high tide of rapid cattle pen mud creation was immediately set off in all communes of the county. 49,700 people were fixed every day to engage in rapid mud creation in conjunction with other production. From March 15 to April 1, within eighteen days, a total of more than 4.7 million dan of cattle pen mud was created. On average, the amount of high-quality pig and cattle manure added to each mu of land increased by twelve dan.

### 湖南多养猪多积粪  宜章推行快速高温造淤法

　　湖南多养猪多积粪
　　宜章推行快速高温造淤法
    本报长沙17日电　湖南各地采取养猪积肥增产粮食的办法，大力发展生猪事业。到今年3月中旬止，全省存栏生猪约有一千二百多万头，平均每户有一头多。根据农民多年来养猪积肥的经验，每一头猪一年能积肥四十担左右。以目前全省存栏生猪计算，预计今年能积肥五亿担左右，全省平均每亩稻田可施猪粪十来担。这对保证今年全省农业增产有很重大的意义。随着生猪的发展，不仅增加了城市副食品的供应，而且增加了大量的精肥。长沙县由于生猪的发展，到3月底止，全县收集的家肥有一千零三十三万多担，较去年同期增加三倍多。
    今年各地在贯彻发展集体养猪方针的同时，也尽量扶助一些有条件的社员家庭饲养生猪，以加速生猪事业的发展。临湘羊楼司人民公社双港大队将一百多头生猪贷给一百一十多户有条件养猪的社员后，全大队生猪也很快由一千头发展到一千三百多头。
    为了保证养猪积的肥料能很好收集下田，各地都订立了家肥收集制度和超额奖励办法。一般规定15％左右的猪粪留在食堂培育饲料，80％以上的猪粪下田。
    本报长沙17日电　湖南宜章县各人民公社普遍推行快速高温造淤法，加快猪牛栏淤的发酵和腐烂，增积精肥。
    这个办法是宜章县一六公社下白家生产队，支部书记白冬昌与三个社员试验成功的。做法是：将猪牛栏淤全部出光后，在栏底撒下一些石灰，再垫上五、六把稻草或茅草，加一些容易腐烂的青草和树叶。每天在垫草前，在淤上泼一次人尿或污水，天天泼，天天垫，这样，稻草猪粪经过发烧，很快开始腐烂，加快了出栏时间。过去要个把月出一次栏，每次出淤六十担，现在只要七天到十天就可以出一次，一个月可以出淤一百五十多担。与此同时，还采取“三搭配”（水牛粪与黄牛粪搭配，牛粪与猪粪搭配，干草与青草搭配）的办法，促使牛栏淤腐烂。在牛栏淤出栏后，接着又泼上一些尿和污水，再采用制高温堆肥的办法，在地面上挖一个十字小沟，上面铺一层柴，柴上放一层草皮，草皮上放牛栏淤，淤上面又放草皮或塘泥、沟泥、土灰，接着是一层牛栏淤一层草皮夹塘泥、土灰等，中间还加上茶枯粉，再放一层牛栏淤，堆至六至七尺后，外面用泥封密，中间插一竹筒，一两天从竹筒淋入一次人尿或沟水茶枯水，这样，经过连续发酵，过五至七天就可以使用。如果每四至五天翻一次，过十天就成了碎烂牛栏淤，肥效比过去要提高45％以上。这个队采用这办法，十天内全队增加了牛栏淤二千二百七十五担。
    中共宜章县委及时推广这个办法，3月7日，专门召开广播大会，号召各公社、生产队、作业组普遍推行这个办法，要求做到牛猪栏有人专管，牛猪栏淤有人垫造。接着又在各公社党委书记电话会上，强调专人领导，并通知每个公社派一个党委委员同一个老农到一六公社下白家队实地参观。这样一来，全县各公社立即掀起了快速造牛栏淤高潮，每天固定四万九千七百人结合其他生产搞快速造淤，从3月15日到4月1日十八天内，共造牛栏淤四百七十多万担。平均每亩田增加了优质猪牛粪十二担。
