Xinhua News Agency report: The joint prevention and control area for eliminating crop diseases and insect pests in six provinces and cities—Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Beijing—has achieved remarkable results in preventing and controlling overwintering diseases and insect pests. According to the summary presented at the first cross-regional inspection meeting of the six provinces and cities in mid-April, the prevention and control work during this period will provide favorable conditions for a bumper wheat harvest and a great leap forward in agriculture this year. However, as spring-sown crops have not yet fully emerged from the soil and most diseases and insects are still active in their overwintering parasitic locations, all regions must seize this favorable opportunity to capitalize on the victory and eliminate diseases and insect pests outside the fields. Wheat rust, wheat spider, and other diseases and insect pests that have already occurred on wheat must also be resolutely eliminated.

Due to the relatively high temperatures last winter and this spring, the mortality rate of overwintering pests was low, and their activity began earlier this spring. In response to this situation, in order to ensure a bumper harvest, this joint prevention area has been focusing on preventing and controlling overwintering diseases and insect pests earlier than in any previous year. According to the characteristics of corn borers overwintering in the roots and stalks of miscellaneous grains, the provinces and cities in the joint prevention area adopted methods such as burning, chopping, rolling, retting, fumigating, burying, and sealing to treat more than 90% of corn stalks last winter and this spring. After mobilizing a million people to process corn stalks, the Jin Southeast area of Shanxi Province organized a 10,000-person inspection team to carry out follow-up inspections and comparisons. By the end of March, the area had basically achieved a situation where there were no roots or stalks in the fields, and no stalks in the yards, eliminating the corn borer, the most harmful pest to corn. In order to eliminate cutworms and cotton aphids outside the cotton fields, the Xinxiang area of Henan Province mobilized twenty counties to use homemade sugar syrup to lure and kill cutworm adults. Xinxiang County sprayed 1059 to control trees parasitized by cotton aphids, with very good results. Shaanxi Province also vigorously prevented and controlled wheat rust. Last winter, it universally controlled the disease in affected fields, and this spring it mobilized the masses to universally control the disease in some affected fields two or three times, ensuring that wheat safely passed the jointing stage, laying a good foundation for this year's bumper harvest. In addition, various provinces also carried out prevention and control of cotton bollworms, sweet potato black spot, and other diseases and insect pests.

In carrying out prevention and control work, many regions have established disease and insect pest prevention and control offices or headquarters at all levels, and widely publicized the great significance of eliminating overwintering diseases and insects to the masses. The Jin Southeast and Jin South areas of Shanxi Province have established plant protection organizations from the special district down to the commune and production team levels, and have used on-site observation, physical exhibitions, and "look, debate, and calculate" methods for publicity. Joint prevention efforts were also organized in the connecting areas of provinces, special districts, and counties, working together to thoroughly and cleanly eliminate diseases and insect pests. Fifty-two counties and cities in Shaanxi Province organized sixteen joint prevention cooperation zones, established joint prevention committees, formulated joint prevention plans, unified actions, and supported each other, so that the work of preventing and controlling overwintering diseases and insect pests quickly formed a high tide.

    联合防治病虫害战绩辉煌
    山西河北等六个省市正在趁胜追击夺取更大战果
    据新华社讯　山西、山东、河南、河北、陕西、北京六省市消灭农作物病虫害联防区，防治越冬病虫害的工作取得了显著成绩。据4月中旬六省市第一次交叉大检查总结会上反映，这一时期的防治工作将给今年小麦丰收和农业大跃进提供有利条件。但目前春播作物尚未全部出土，大部病虫仍在越冬寄生的地方活动，各地必须抓住这一有利时机，乘胜追击，把病虫害消灭在农田以外。对小麦上已发生的锈病、麦蜘蛛等病虫害也要坚决予以消灭。
    去冬今春，气温较高，害虫越冬死亡率低，今春开始活动的时间也较早，针对这种情况，为确保丰收，这个联防区今年防治越冬病虫害的工作比以往任何一年都抓得早。联防区各省市根据玉米螟在杂谷的根茬、秸秆里过冬的特点，在去冬今春采取烧、铡、轧、沤、熏、埋、封等办法处理玉米秸秆90％以上。山西晋东南专区在发动百万大军处理秸秆以后，又组织万人检查团，进行扫尾评比工作，到3月底止，这个专区已基本上实现了地无根茬，场院无秸秆，消灭了对玉米危害最大的玉米螟。河南省新乡专区为了将地老虎、棉蚜消灭在棉田以外，全区二十个县利用土制糖浆诱杀地老虎成虫，新乡县喷一○五九防治棉蚜寄生的树木二万七千余株，效果很好。陕西省还大力防治小麦锈病，去冬在发病田里普遍防治一遍，今春又发动群众在部分发病田里普遍防治了两、三遍，保证了小麦安全渡过拔节关，给今年丰收打下良好的基础。此外，各省还对棉红铃虫、甘薯黑斑病等病虫害进行了防治。
    在开展防治工作中，许多地区都逐级建立了防治病虫害办公室或指挥部，广泛地向群众宣传了消灭越冬病虫的重大意义。山西省晋东南和晋南两专区，从专区直到公社、生产队都建立了植物保护组织，并且采取现场观摩，实物展览和“看、辩、算”等方法进行宣传。在省、专区、县的毗连地区还组织联防，协同作战，彻底、干净地消灭病虫害。陕西全省五十二个县、市，组织了十六个联防协作区，分别成立了联防委员会，制订联防计划，统一行动，互相支援，使防治越冬病虫的工作很快就形成高潮。
