The Xinyuan, Suiding, and Huocheng counties of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have dozens of "Fruit Gullies" and "Fruit Mountains" full of wild apple, pear, apricot, and walnut trees. It is estimated that these wild fruit trees cover an area of approximately 200,000 mu and produce several hundred million jin of apples annually. In spring, the mountains and fields for dozens of li are filled with the fragrance of flowers and the songs of birds; in autumn, after the fruits ripen, they fall to the ground, accumulating to a depth of one or two chi.

Starting last year, the autonomous region's agricultural departments established three bases in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture for the comprehensive development and utilization of wild fruit forests. They built hundreds of houses in the wild primitive fruit forests, cultivated thousands of mu of land, and have already tested grafting and pruning to improve more than 10,000 fruit trees. They have also raised bees, sheep, deer, pigs, and other poultry. This year, their plan to develop and transform wild fruit forests will be twice as large as last year. In addition to continuing to improve fruit trees in large quantities and developing agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline production, they will also collect fresh fruits to make candied fruit, fruit wine, and jam.

　　新疆开发野生果林
    新疆维吾尔族自治区伊犁哈萨克族自治州的新源、绥定、霍城等县，有好几十处长满了野生苹果、梨、杏、核桃树等的
  “果子沟”和“果子山”。据估计，这些野生果树面积约有二十万亩，年产苹果几亿斤。春天，几十里山野一片花香鸟语；秋天，果子成熟后随风自落，在地堆积一、二尺厚。
    从去年开始，自治区农业部门在伊犁哈萨克族自治州建立了三个全面开发和综合利用野生果林的据点，在野生原始果林里盖起了数百间房屋，开垦了上千亩土地，已经试验嫁接和整枝改良果树一万多株，并且喂养了蜜蜂、羊、鹿、猪和其他家禽等。今年，他们计划开发和改造野生果林的规模将比去年大两倍，除了继续大量改良果树，发展农、牧业和副业生产外，还要采集鲜果，制造果脯、果酒和果酱等。
