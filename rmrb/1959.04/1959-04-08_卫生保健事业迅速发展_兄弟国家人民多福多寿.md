    Rapid Development of Health Care
    People in Fraternal Countries Enjoy Longevity and Well-being
    Czechoslovakia: One doctor for every 610 citizens
    Bulgaria: Mortality rate lower than in the US, UK, and France
    Romania: Average life expectancy is about sixty-two years
    Albania: Rapid population growth reaches 1.5 million

    Czechoslovakia
    The health care system in Czechoslovakia has greatly developed in recent years.
    This year, the state's allocation for health care has almost doubled compared to 1950. This year, it is stipulated that nine hospitals and sanatoriums be built or expanded, mainly in the Slovak region. In addition, construction of about thirteen major health care institutions will soon begin.
    By the end of last year, the total number of hospital beds in Czechoslovakian health institutions had increased to about 165,000, an increase of about 4,400 beds compared to the previous year. Czechoslovakia now has 220,000 doctors, or one doctor for every 610 citizens, which is one of the highest ratios in the world.
    Czechoslovak health care has made outstanding achievements in protecting infants and children. Nationwide, the infant mortality rate has been reduced to an average of 29.5 per thousand.
    Currently, more than 90% of the population in Czechoslovakia enjoys free medical care. This applies not only to all employed people, their families, cooperative members, etc., but also to individual farmers if they have accidents at work. In addition, children under the age of fifteen and all maternity women are entitled to free medical care.
    Last year, Czechoslovakia's famous mineral spring resorts helped more than 270,000 patients recover their health; 85% of these patients did not pay a penny for treatment and accommodation. Before the war, mineral spring resorts were places where only the very wealthy gathered. Czechoslovakia ranks first in the world in using mineral springs to treat the diseases of the working people.

    Hungary
    Hungary's health care is developing day by day.
    In 1921, there were only 4,489 doctors in the country, while in 1958, the number of doctors reached 14,614. In 1921, there were an average of 5.6 doctors per 10,000 people, while in 1958, there were 14.8 doctors per 10,000 people. There has also been a significant increase in the supply of medicine and hospital beds. The picture below shows a common clinic providing medical care to residents.

    Bulgaria
    Bulgaria has one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita in the world. Currently, Bulgaria has a total of 10,200 doctors, an average of one doctor for every 750 residents. This figure has caught up with the United States and surpassed Italy, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom.
    Before liberation, Bulgaria had only 3,516 doctors in the country. In the past fifteen years, the number of doctors has almost tripled. Due to the continuous improvement of the working people's lives and the development of medical care after liberation, Bulgaria's mortality rate has been reduced to 8.6 per thousand, lower than that of capitalist countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Switzerland. In terms of maternal mortality rate, Bulgaria is one of the lowest countries in the world.

    Romania
    Romania's health care work has achieved great success in recent years. Now the infant mortality rate has dropped to 6.9%. Last year, the average life expectancy was about sixty-two years.
    Before liberation, Romania's child mortality rate was as high as 20%, ranking first in Europe. In 1957, the child mortality rate had dropped to 8.1%.
    In recent years, Romania has taken measures to eliminate malaria and has achieved significant success. In 1947, 210,000 people in the country suffered from malaria, but now the disease has been eradicated. The number of deaths from tuberculosis has also been greatly reduced.
    These achievements are due to the Romanian Workers' Party and the government's concern for the health of the people. After liberation, Romania adopted a policy of combining active prevention and treatment of diseases, as well as many measures to improve people's health conditions. Before liberation, Romania did not have a single maternity hospital, now there are more than 1,600 maternity hospitals. The number of women giving birth in maternity hospitals and hospitals has increased twenty-one times compared to 1938, and the number of beds in children's hospitals has also increased more than nine times. The health care situation in rural areas has greatly improved. There are now 225 hospitals that can admit inpatients and more than 2,000 clinics in rural areas, as well as many tuberculosis prevention and treatment centers and dental clinics. In addition to medical institutions, Romania also has more than twenty medical research institutions.
    In the first half of this year, Romania will establish five county hospitals, one hundred and fifty rural clinics, and will increase 2,500 patient beds.

    Albania
    Since liberation, Albania's health care system has developed rapidly. This year, the funds used for health care will reach more than 1.59 billion leks, 300 times that of 1938.
    After liberation, thanks to the government's adoption of preventive and free treatment measures, diseases such as malaria were completely eradicated in a short period of time. Last year, more than one-third of the country's population was vaccinated against smallpox and injected with vaccines.
    Currently, Albania has 56 hospitals, 82 maternity hospitals, five pulmonary sanatoriums, fifteen tuberculosis prevention and treatment centers, and three central hospitals for treating rheumatic diseases. Clinics have been widely established in vast rural areas. This year, the number of clinics will reach nearly 600. Now all maternity women in the country receive free delivery, and all cadres and their families enjoy free medical care.
    Due to the rapid development of health and medical care after liberation, Albania's population has grown rapidly. To date, Albania's population has reached 1.5 million, an increase of 45% compared to 1938. (Attached picture)

    卫生保健事业迅速发展
    兄弟国家人民多福多寿
    捷　每610个公民有一个医生
  　保　居民死亡率低于美英法等国
    罗　人民平均寿命约为六十二岁
    阿　人口增长迅速已达150万
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克的卫生保健事业近年来有了很大的发展。
    今年国家用于保健事业的拨款比1950年差不多增加了两倍。今年规定要建立或扩建九个医院和疗养院，它们主要将建立在斯洛伐克地区。此外，约有十三个主要保健机关的建设工程也即将开工。
    截至去年年底，捷克斯洛伐克卫生机关的病床总数已约增加到十六万五千个，即比前一年约增加了四千四百个床位。捷克斯洛伐克现在拥有二十二万个医生，即每六百一十个公民有一个医生，这是世界上最高的比例。
    捷克斯洛伐克保健事业在保护婴儿和儿童方面取得了杰出的成就。全国范围内，婴儿的死亡率平均降低到千分之二十九点五。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克全国居民有90％以上享受公费医疗。这不仅适用于一切就业的人，他们的家属，合作社社员等，而且还适用于个体农民，如果他们在工作中发生事故的话。此外，年龄不满十五岁的儿童以及所有产妇都享有公费医疗的待遇。
    捷克斯洛伐克著名的矿泉疗养地去年帮助了二十七万多名病人恢复健康；这些病人中的85％没有付分文的治疗费和住宿费。在战前，矿泉疗养地只是非常富有的人聚会的地方。在用矿泉疗养劳动人民的疾病方面，捷克斯洛伐克占世界第一位。
    匈牙利
  匈牙利的保健事业正日益发展。
    1921年全国只有四千四百八十九个医生，而1958年医生人数就达一万四千六百一十四人。在1921年平均每一万人有五点六个医生，而1958年每一万人就有十四点八个医生。医药供应和医院病床等方面也有显著增加。下图为一个普通的诊疗所给居民看病。
    保加利亚
    按人口平均计算，保加利亚拥有的医生数目已居世界前列。目前，保加利亚共有一万零二百名医生，平均每七百五十个居民中就有一名医生。这个数字已赶上了美国，超过了意大利、瑞士、法国和英国。
    解放前，保加利亚全国仅有三千五百一十六名医生。近十五年来，医生的数目约增加了两倍。由于解放后劳动人民生活的不断改善和医疗事业的发展，保加利亚居民的死亡率已降低到千分之八点六，低于美国、英国、法国和瑞士等资本主义国家。而在产妇的死亡率方面，保加利亚是世界上最低的国家之一。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚卫生保健工作近几年来获得了很大的成就。现在婴儿死亡率已降到6.9％。去年人的平均寿命为六十二岁左右。
    解放前罗马尼亚的儿童死亡率曾高达20％，居欧洲第一位。1957年儿童死亡率已降到8.1％。
    罗马尼亚近几年来曾采取措施消灭疟疾病并已获得显著成就。1947年全国有二十一万人患疟疾，而现在已经消灭这种疾病。因患结核病而死亡的人数也大大减少。
    这些成就的取得是由于罗马尼亚工人党和政府对人民健康的关怀。罗马尼亚在解放后，对疾病采取了积极预防和治疗相结合的方针以及许多措施，改善人民的卫生条件。解放前罗马尼亚没有一所妇产院，现在已有一千六百多个妇产院。在妇产院和医院生产的妇女比1938年增加了二十一倍，儿童医院的床位也增加了九倍多。农村中的卫生医疗状况有了很大的改善。全国农村现有二百二十五个可以接收住院病人的医院和二千多个诊疗所，还有许多结核病防治所和牙科诊所。除去医疗机构外，罗马尼亚还有二十多个医学研究机构。
    今年上半年内，罗马尼亚将设立五个县医院，一百五十个农村诊疗所，将增加二千五百个病人床位。
    阿尔巴尼亚
    解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚的保健事业发展很快。今年，用于保健事业的经费将达十五亿九千多万里克，为1938年的三百倍。
    解放后，由于政府采取了预防、免费治疗等措施，在很短时期内就完全扑灭了疟疾等疾病。去年，全国三分之一以上的人施种了牛痘和注射了预防针。
    目前，阿尔巴尼亚已有五十六所医院，八十二所产科医院、五个肺病疗养院、十五个结核病防治所和三个治疗风湿性病症的中心医院。在广大的农村中普遍建立了诊疗所。今年诊疗所的数目将达到近六百个。现在全国的产妇都受到免费接生，全国干部及其家属都享有公费医疗。
    由于解放后卫生、医疗事业的迅速发展，阿尔巴尼亚人口增长很快。到目前为止，阿尔巴尼亚人口已达一百五十万人，比1938年增加了45％。（附图片）
