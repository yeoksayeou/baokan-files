Revolutionary Martyr's Poetry Collection
    The Song of Liyuan
    He Jinzhai
    The waters of Liyuan are clear and cool,
    Meandering and drifting into Anxiang.
    More than a hundred thousand residents on both banks,
    Engaged in diligent farming for generations.
    Large and small granaries piled with rice,
    And cotton transported to Sichuan and Kang.
    Abundant produce, enough to eat and wear,
    Everyone content and happy like in the days of Yao and Shun.
    Who knew such good times would be hard to keep,
    A horde of monsters indulging in evil deeds.
    Corrupt officials and local tyrants,
    Twisting hands and colluding with each other.
    Levying taxes, raising funds, collecting grain,
    Pressing for rent, seizing land and houses.
    Zhang San leaves and Li Si comes,
    Morning and evening, without respite.
    New donations and old debts tightly intertwined,
    Even a patch of greens is dug up by the roots.
    No sound of chickens or dogs in front of the door,
    The kitchen fire has long been extinguished.
    Pitiful are the vast working people,
    Unable to bear exploitation and oppression;
    Abandoning their homes and fleeing without a path,
    Everywhere is as dark as a crow.
    Where can they hide themselves?
    Hating that the sky has no ladder and the earth no hole!
    Bearing all kinds of suffering in their hearts,
    Facing each other, only sobbing.
    Since the Nanchang Uprising,
    Liyuan has attracted more attention from the bandits.
    Believing that He Long was born there,
    There must be a lot of revolutionary hidden strength.
    Fearing that the raging fire would burn high,
    The Chiang bandits were frightened and anxious.
    Dispatching a large number of bandit troops,
    To suppress and assimilate the Communists more actively.
    Searching the mountains and fields tightly,
    Treating the people as enemies.
    Putting red hats on their heads,
    Accusing them of committing heinous crimes.
    Arresting people from morning till night,
    Killing, binding, and imprisoning.
    Fresh blood flowed into ditches on the ground,
    In the prison, the wronged prisoners crowded against the walls.
    Many patriots are not afraid of death,
    Willing to resist knives and saws with their flesh.
    One thing is even more heartbreaking,
    Even babies are torn like paper.
    Women unwilling to be raped,
    Hanging themselves or jumping into the river to commit suicide.
    Seeing the eight or nine counties of Bangli,
    Mountains and rivers changed color, and people disappeared.
    The disaster is deeper than water,
    Wanting to eliminate it, there is no good plan.
    They have also constantly struggled,
    But the results are always defeated.
    Often looking for the reasons afterwards,
    Sighing in vain that there is no leadership!
    Everyone looks up to He Long,
    Only he can swallow the demons.
    The Party seeks liberation for the people,
    Must rely on him as the leader.
    The Party's kindness is deeper than parents',
    Will certainly not let the people fall into distress.
    Sure enough, he was sent back from afar,
    Everyone's ambition is a hundred times higher.
    Together they throw themselves into the struggle,
    Not afraid of life, death, and hardship.
    Struggle can seek survival,
    Everyone understands this clearly.
    From now on, with the Party as the leader,
    We are not afraid of anything.
    I have now written the Song of Liyuan,
    As a declaration to punish the bandits.
    The Chiang bandits are already relying on Xishan,
    Their death throes are also useless.
    Hoping that everyone is of one mind,
    Strive forward and do not retreat!
    Holding big knives and guns,
    Fighting all over Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi.
    To take the large piece of land in the country,
    "Divide and occupy" it piece by piece.
    The obstacles ahead must be swept away,
    Eliminate the enemy thoroughly.
    Overthrow the reactionary rule,
    Establish the people's power.
    The Party is like the rising sun in the east,
    The rosy glow has already illuminated the earth.
    The people's anger turns into a raging tide,
    What force can resist it!
    Revolution roars everywhere,
    Its momentum is like a storm sweeping away leftovers.
    Estimating in less than twenty years,
    We will celebrate victory in Beijing and Shanghai!
          1928

    革命烈士诗抄
    澧源歌
    贺锦斋
    澧源之水清且凉，
    蜿蜒漂荡入安乡。
    两岸居民百余万，
    世代勤苦事农桑。
    大仓小廪堆谷米，
    还有棉花运川康。
    出产丰富衣食足，
    人人鼓腹乐陶唐。
    那知好景难再得，
    一群鬼怪恣妖孽。
    贪官污吏与豪绅，
    彼此扭手相勾结。
    抽税筹款征钱粮，
    催租逼押夺田宅。
    张三去了李四来，
    暮暮朝朝无停歇。
    新捐旧债紧纠缠，
    一窝青菜连根掘。
    门前鸡犬不闻声，
    灶中烟火久断绝。
    可怜广大劳动人，
    难堪剥削与压迫；
    弃家逃走走无途，
    处处乌鸦一般黑。
    到底何处可藏身？
    恨天无梯地无穴！
    心中忍受千般苦，
    面面相对只悲咽。
    自从南昌起了义，
    澧源更招匪注意。
    认为贺龙生其间，
    定多革命潜伏力。
    惟恐烈火发高烧，
    吓得蒋匪心着急。
    调遣大批强盗军，
    剿共溶共更积极。
    漫山遍野紧搜查，
    硬将人民当仇敌。
    头上套着红帽子，
    诬为犯了滔天罪。
    从早到晚乱抓人，
    一杀二绑三关闭。
    地上鲜血流成渠，
    狱中冤囚挤破壁。
    许多志士不怕死，
    愿将肉身抗刀锯。
    尤有一事更痛心，
    婴儿也当纸撕碎。
    妇女不愿受奸污，
    悬梁投河甘自缢。
    眼见浜澧八九县，
    山川改色人绝迹。
    灾难实在比水深，
    欲想排荡无良计。
    也曾不断作斗争，
    结果总是败下去。
    常从事后追原因，
    无人领导空叹息！
    大家抬眼望贺龙，
    只有他能吞魔魅。
    党为人民谋解放，
    必须靠他作领队。
    党比父母恩德深，
    定不使民遭陷溺。
    果然派他远归来，
    人人雄心高百倍。
    一齐投入斗争场，
    不辞生死与艰巨。
    斗争可以求生存，
    这点大家才明晰。
    从此有党作领导，
    我们事事都不惧。
    我今写了澧源歌，
    当作一篇讨匪檄。
    蒋匪已经靠西山，
    垂死挣扎也无济。
    尚望万众一条心，
    努力向前莫后退！
    手执大刀和枪炮，
    打遍湘鄂与赣豫。
    要将全国大片土，
    一块一块来“割据”。
    前途障碍要荡平，
    消灭敌人要干脆。
    反动统治要推翻，
    人民政权要建立。
    党如旭日向东升，
    霞光早已照大地。
    人民愤火化怒潮，
    什么力量难抵御！
    革命到处发吼声，
    势如暴风卷残絮。
    估计不到二十年，
    定在京沪庆胜利！
          1928年
