Győr-Sopron County Takes the Lead
By our reporter Wang Chongjie

Since the beginning of spring this year, a nationwide upsurge of socialist transformation in agriculture has been sweeping across Hungary. In this vigorous movement, Győr-Sopron County has taken the lead and forged ahead. In just two and a half months, farmers in all 177 villages in the county have joined agricultural production cooperatives, making it the first county in the country to complete agricultural collectivization.

The organized farmers immediately threw themselves into the spring plowing and sowing work with great enthusiasm. They fought the first battle on the production front with collective strength, and the results of this year's spring labor are the best in more than a decade. So far, the county has completed the sowing of 5,000 hectares of spring barley and oats. The sowing area of ​​fodder crops has increased by 5% compared with last year, the sowing area of ​​sugar beets has increased by 2,000 hectares, and 1,000 hectares of peas have been sown. The county will complete the sowing of 70,000 hectares of corn, of which 90% are hybrid varieties. The fertilization of autumn crops is 90% complete. Last year, the county used a total of 1,450 truckloads of chemical fertilizer, and this spring alone, 1,720 truckloads of chemical fertilizer were used.

Why were such achievements possible?

Comrade Lobosh, secretary of the Győr-Sopron County Party Committee, told reporters that the gratifying achievements were due to the county's conscientious implementation of the Party's correct agricultural policy since November 4, 1956, correcting some mistakes and deviations in the past collectivization movement, and generally improving the lives of working farmers, which strengthened their trust in the Party and the government. The government's resolution on strengthening agricultural production cooperatives, promulgated in 1958, further consolidated and improved the established agricultural production cooperatives in political, economic, and organizational terms. Before the counter-revolutionary events, only 40 kilograms of chemical fertilizer were applied per hectare of cultivated land in the county, while last year, cooperatives applied 132 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare of land. Last year, the yield of wheat per hectare in the county's cooperatives was 1.4 quintals more than that of individual farmers, 2.5 quintals more for rye, 1 quintal more for autumn barley, and 2 quintals more for oats. The cooperatives have also made great achievements in animal husbandry. Last year, the number of cattle increased by 27% and the number of pigs increased by 16%. These excellent production results have greatly enhanced the prestige of the cooperatives.

After the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party made a resolution in December last year to accelerate the socialist transformation of agriculture, the county Party committee, based on the resolution of the Party Central Committee, criticized various erroneous views on the agricultural collectivization movement, unified the understanding of cadres, and under the leadership of the county Party committee, organized teams of Party members, cadres, and activists to be responsible for assisting local leaders in carrying out the propaganda and organization work of collectivization. The Party organizations in rural areas also widely organized activist networks and vigorously launched the propaganda and organization work of cooperatives. Workers in various places also vigorously supported the socialist transformation of agriculture. Many workers actively participated in the propaganda and organization work of cooperatives. In order to meet the needs of the rapid development of agricultural production cooperatives, factory workers proposed to over-fulfill the production of more agricultural machinery, building materials, and chemical fertilizers to support the countryside.

In terms of the organizational steps of the cooperatives, the county adopted a working method from point to surface. Each district first selected a key village, concentrated its efforts to help these villages embark on the road of collectivization, and accumulated experience to drive other villages. Therefore, the development of cooperatives is getting faster and faster. Later, farmers in many villages automatically established cooperatives within a day.

After the establishment of the cooperatives, organizational work was immediately grasped, and a movement to consolidate the cooperatives was launched. State-owned farms actively helped the newly established cooperatives to formulate production plans, and factory workers helped the cooperatives to build cattle and horse barns. For example, the entire staff of the Győr Machine Tool Factory organized a voluntary labor team to help the cooperatives build cattle and horse barns in their spare time and on holidays. The factory director, Party committee secretary, and trade union chairman also participated in the voluntary labor together with the workers. Various agencies and enterprises also contacted the newly established cooperatives separately to provide regular assistance to the cooperatives.

The state has also given great support to the newly established cooperatives in terms of manpower and materials. In addition to selecting many outstanding agronomists to work in the cooperatives, it has also provided the county with a long-term loan of 160 million forints for the construction of cattle and horse barns. More than 130 universal tractors were provided, and a large number of high-quality seeds and chemical fertilizers were supplied.

After embarking on the road of collectivization, the political enthusiasm of the farmers has also been unprecedentedly high. At present, the Party is strengthening the development of organizations and absorbing outstanding cooperative members into the Party.

Comrade Lobosh concluded by saying that the farmers of Győr-Sopron County have embarked on the road of building a new life. Although there are still some difficulties at present, no difficulties can prevent the working farmers of Hungary from advancing on the socialist road.

### 一马当先的吉厄尔——索普伦州

    一马当先的吉厄尔——索普伦州
    本报记者　王崇杰
    今年开春以来，匈牙利全国各地掀起了农业社会主义改造热潮。在这个轰轰烈烈的运动中，吉厄尔—索普伦州一马当先，勇往直前，仅两个半月时间，全州一百七十七个村的农民全部加入了生产合作社，成了全国第一个完成农业合作化的州。
    组织起来的农民，立即满怀热情地投入了春耕春播工作。他们以集体的力量在生产战线上打了第一次胜仗，今年春季劳动的成绩是十几年来最好的。到目前为止，全州已完成了五千霍尔特春大麦和燕麦的播种工作。饲料作物的播种面积比去年增加了5％，糖萝卜的播种面积增加了二千霍尔特，并且播种了一千霍尔特的豌豆，将要完成七万霍尔特玉米的播种，其中90％是杂交良种。秋季作物的施肥90％已结束。去年一年全州共用了一千四百五十车化肥，今年仅春季就用了一千七百二十车化肥。
    为什么能取得这样的成就呢？
    吉厄尔—索普伦州的党委书记洛博什同志告诉记者说，所以取得这样令人喜悦的成绩，是由于从1956年11月4日以来，这个州认真的贯彻了党的正确的农业政策，纠正了过去合作化运动中的一些错误和偏向，使劳动农民的生活普遍地得到了改善，加强了他们对党和政府的信任。1958年政府公布的加强农业生产合作社的决议，使已成立的农业生产合作社在政治、经济和组织方面得到了进一步的巩固和提高。反革命事件以前，这个州每一霍尔特的耕地只施用四十公斤化肥，而去年合作社每霍尔特的土地所施的化肥增加到一百三十二公斤。去年这个州的合作社每霍尔特小麦的收成比个体农民多一点四公担，稞麦多二点五公担，秋大麦多一公担，燕麦多两公担。在牧畜方面合作社也取得了很大的成绩。去年牛的头数增加了27％，猪的头数增加16％。这些优良的生产成绩，大大提高了合作社的威信。
    在去年12月匈牙利社会主义工人党中央作出加速农业社会主义改造的决议之后，州党委根据党中央的决议，批判了对农业合作化运动的各种错误看法，统一了干部的认识，在州党委的领导下，组织了党员干部、积极分子工作队，负责协助地方的领导，进行合作化的宣传和组织工作。农村的党组织并广泛地组织了积极分子网，大力展开了合作社的宣传组织工作。各地的工人也大力地支持农业的社会主义改造，很多工人都积极地参加了合作社的宣传组织工作。为满足农业生产合作社迅速发展的需要，工厂的职工们提出要超计划生产更多的农业机器、建筑材料和化肥来支援农村。
    在合作社的组织步骤方面，这个州是采取从点到面的工作方法，各区首先选择了一个重点村，集中精力帮助这几个村走上合作化的道路，并且积累经验，带动其他各村。所以合作社的发展是越来越快。后来很多村的农民在一天内便自动地成立了合作社。
    在合作社成立后，立即抓紧进行了组织工作，掀起了巩固合作社的运动。国营农场都积极帮助新成立起来的合作社制订生产计划，工厂的职工们帮助合作社建筑牛马房。例如，久尔市机床厂的全体职工组织了义务劳动队，利用工作之余和假日的时间，帮助合作社建筑牛马房。这个厂的厂长、党委书记和工会主席也都同工人们一起参加了义务劳动。各机关和各企业也分头联系新成立的合作社，对合作社进行经常的帮助。
    国家也在人力、物力方面给了新成立的合作社以很大的支持，除选派很多优秀的农艺师到合作社工作外，并向这个州提供了一亿六千万福林的长期贷款作建筑牛马房用。提供了一百三十多架万能拖拉机，并且供给了大量的优良种子和化学肥料。
    走上合作化道路后，农民的政治热情也空前高涨。目前党正在加强发展组织，吸收优秀的合作社社员入党。
    洛博什同志最后说，吉厄尔—索普伦州的农民已经走上了建设新生活的大道，虽然目前还存在着一些困难，但是，一切困难都不能阻止匈牙利的劳动农民在社会主义道路上挺进。
