    Strengthening Maternal and Child Health Work in Collective Living
    Ministry of Health Holds Symposium to Study Specific Measures and This Year's Tasks
    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd April. The Ministry of Health recently held a symposium on maternal and child health work with representatives from fourteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions participating.
    The representatives unanimously agreed that with the overall Great Leap Forward in China's industrial and agricultural production and health undertakings, maternal and child health work also experienced unprecedented development in 1958. In particular, after the people's communes were established, rural kindergartens and nurseries for busy farming seasons were rapidly and universally established throughout the country, and a large number of female laborers were liberated. For example, in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, during the busy farming season, 71% of children were admitted to nurseries and kindergartens, and more than 98% of women attended work in production labor such as drought resistance and autumn harvesting. Various methods have been adopted in various places to train nursery staff, establish health care systems in nurseries and kindergartens, conduct health check-ups, isolate the sick, and prevent diseases without illness, effectively preventing the occurrence of infectious diseases, and maternity hospitals have also been universally established in rural areas. At present, simple maternity hospitals have been set up in most communes and management areas, and phenomena such as puerperal fever, neonatal tetanus, and dystocia in rural areas have been greatly reduced. Various localities have also strengthened the labor protection of women, and according to the physiological characteristics of women, they have adopted measures such as women's health care signs and safe attendance boxes to facilitate production team leaders to grasp the situation in a timely and accurate manner and make unified arrangements. Many areas have implemented the "three adjustments and three non-adjustments" (adjusting dryness but not wetness during menstruation, adjusting lightness but not heaviness during pregnancy, and adjusting nearness but not farness for breastfeeding mothers) to prevent and reduce women's diseases and the occurrence of miscarriage and premature birth, and to solve the difficulties of some infant mothers.
    The representatives fully studied and discussed the basic tasks and specific measures of maternal and child health work in 1959, and determined that the basic tasks of maternal and child health work in 1959 were: to do a good job in the health care of nurseries and kindergartens, to prevent and control the occurrence of children's infectious diseases, to rectify and consolidate maternity hospitals, to train cadres, to carry out women's labor protection work, and to better serve production.
    In doing a good job in the health care of nurseries and kindergartens, the meeting believed that with the consolidation and development of the people's communes, various places should adopt methods such as combining breastfeeding groups with nurseries, combining nurseries with kindergartens, and combining day care with full care to develop various types and sizes of nurseries. Various localities should establish nurseries based on production teams or production sub-teams under the unified leadership of the local party and government, and the number of children admitted to each nursery should not be too large. At the same time, take the method of combining community cadres, educators, and children's parents to jointly run nurseries well, carefully select nursery staff, and nurseries and kindergartens should establish necessary health systems. Basic medical units should strengthen their leadership over nurseries and kindergartens, assign teams to be responsible for different areas, and do a good job in health care and medical work.
    The symposium put forward specific requirements, measures, and methods for rectifying and consolidating maternity hospitals, further preventing maternal and infant infectious diseases, carrying out women's labor protection work, and strengthening the training of cadres.
    The representatives unanimously agreed that to do a good job in maternal and child health work, it is first necessary to closely rely on the leadership of the Party and the government to promptly point out the direction and put forward the problems that need to be focused on in each period; second, it is necessary to rely on the guidance and assistance of relevant departments such as the Women's Federation, trade unions, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Labor, and the Red Cross; third, it is necessary to combine with the masses, hand over scientific and technological knowledge to the masses, and summarize and improve the experience created by the masses.

    加强集体生活中的妇幼卫生工作
    卫生部召开座谈会研究具体措施和今年任务
    新华社3日讯　卫生部最近召开了十四个省、市、自治区代表参加的妇幼卫生工作座谈会。
    代表们一致认为：随着我国工农业生产和卫生事业的全面大跃进，1958年妇幼卫生工作也有了空前的发展。特别是人民公社化以后，农村幼儿园、农忙托儿所迅速在各地普遍建立起来，大批妇女劳动力得到了解放。如山东高唐县在农忙时，有71％的儿童入了托儿所和幼儿园，在抗旱、秋收等生产劳动中，就有98％以上妇女出勤。各地曾采取多种多样方式培训保育员，在托儿所、幼儿园里建立了保健制度，进行健康检查，有病隔离、没病预防，有效地防止了传染病的发生，妇产院也在各地农村普遍建立起来。现在，绝大部分地区的公社和管理区都设立了简易妇产院，农村中产褥热、新生儿破伤风、难产等现象大大减少。各地还加强了对妇女的劳动保护，根据妇女生理特点，采取妇女保健挂牌、安全出勤箱等，便于生产队长及时、准确地掌握情况，统一安排。很多地区都实行了“三调三不调”（即经期调干不调湿，孕期调轻不调重，哺乳的母亲调近不调远）的措施，防止和减少了妇女疾病和流产、早产的发生，解决一部分婴儿母亲的困难等。
    代表们对1959年妇幼卫生工作的基本任务和具体措施，作了充分的研究和讨论，确定1959年妇幼卫生工作的基本任务是：作好托儿所、幼儿园的卫生保健工作，防治儿童传染病的发生，整顿和巩固妇产院，培训干部，开展妇女劳动保护工作，更好地为生产服务。
    在做好托儿所和幼儿园卫生保健工作方面，会议认为，随着人民公社的巩固和发展，各地应采取哺乳组与托儿所相结合、托儿所与幼儿园相结合，日托与全托相结合等办法，发展各种各样类型及规模的托儿所。各地应在当地党政统一领导下，以生产队或生产小队为基础成立托儿所，每所收托儿童不宜过多。同时，采取由社干部、保教员和儿童家长三结合的办法，共同负责办好托儿所，慎重选择保育员，托儿所和幼儿园应订立必要的卫生制度等。各基层医疗单位应当加强对托儿所和幼儿园的领导，分队分片包干，做好卫生保健和医疗工作。
    座谈会对整顿巩固妇产院、进一步防止妇婴传染病、开展妇女劳动保护工作、加强训练培养干部等方面都提出了具体要求、措施和办法。
    与会代表一致认为：做好妇幼卫生工作，首先要紧紧依靠党和政府的领导及时指出方向，提出每一个时期要着重解决的问题；其次，要依靠妇联、工会、教育部、劳动部、红十字会等有关部门的指导和协助；第三，必须和群众结合，把科学技术交给群众，总结和提高群众创造的经验。
