Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, April 2nd. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant fully utilized the enthusiasm of the workers, creating the miracle of locomotives being put into production and completed for delivery in the same month, greatly shortening the locomotive production cycle. By March 31st, the entire plant had manufactured fifty new locomotives this year, exceeding the first quarter's state plan by three locomotives.

The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant has a large locomotive production task this year. A locomotive has more than four thousand parts, and the processing and assembly process is extremely complex. In the past, the production cycle of each locomotive generally took two to three months. This year's leap forward situation not only requires a significant increase in locomotive production but also requires them to put materials in and have locomotives rolling out in the same month.

In response to this situation, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant's Party committee fully mobilized the masses to overcome key technical problems. Groups within the factory set "eight guarantees" targets with eight conditions, including high output, high quality, and safety, and carried out an "eight comparisons" competition between groups. Through the competition, some groups in the locomotive workshop shortened the efficiency of installing locomotives from one locomotive every nine days in the past to two locomotives per day. At the end of February, they created a record of installing ten locomotives in sixty hours.

    大连机车车辆厂首季生产新机车五十台
    据新华社旅大2日电　大连机车车辆厂充分发挥工人群众的积极性，从而创造机车生产当月投料，当月制成出厂的奇迹，大大缩短了机车生产周期。到3月31日，全厂今年已经制成了五十台新机车，超额三台完成了第一季度的国家计划。
    大连机车车辆厂今年的机车生产任务很大。一台机车有四千多个部件，加工组装过程极其复杂。过去，每台机车的生产周期一般都要两个月到三个月。今年的跃进形势，不仅要求大大增加机车的产量，而且还要求他们当月投料，当月出车。
    大连机车车辆厂党委针对这种情况，充分放手发动群众，攻破技术关键。厂内各组以高产、优质、安全等八项条件，订出“八包”指标，进行了组与组之间的“八比”竞赛。通过竞赛，机车车间有些小组使安装机车的效率从过去的九天装一台，缩短到一天装两台，2月底并创造了六十小时安装十台机车的纪录。
