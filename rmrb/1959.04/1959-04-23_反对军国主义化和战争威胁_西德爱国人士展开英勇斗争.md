Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 21st: According to TASS reports, patriotic people in various cities of West Germany continue to wage a heroic struggle against turning West Germany into a military base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

　　In Hamburg, the progressive youth organization "Youth Action" held a "Struggle Week" to protest the equipping of the West German Bundeswehr with nuclear weapons. Patriotic youths distributed leaflets in Hamburg, calling for opposition to the militarization of West Germany.

　　In order to investigate the attitude of Hamburg residents towards Bonn's militaristic plans, this organization also held a public opinion poll in Hamburg. 88% of the residents who participated in the survey advocated the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe, and opposed equipping the West German Bundeswehr with nuclear weapons.

　　At the end of "Struggle Week," the youths held a demonstration in Hamburg.

　　In Lüdenscheid in North Rhine-Westphalia, the local anti-military service organization, the Peace Warriors organization, and the Association of Victims of Nazism set up a "Struggle Post Against Atomic Death" in the central square of the city. The square was hung with slogans such as: "We will not rest easy when our people are threatened by atomic death," "The atomic base in the Dortmund area threatens all of us," "We oppose the threat of mass slaughter."

　　Residents of Schleswig-Holstein are also constantly struggling against turning the state into a military base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A few days ago, the local authorities of the port of Heiligenhafen submitted a protest to the West German Bundeswehr Command, resolutely opposing the stationing of six West German naval warships in this port.

    反对军国主义化和战争威胁  西德爱国人士展开英勇斗争
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社柏林21日讯：西德全国各个城市的爱国人士继续进行英勇的斗争，反对把西德变为北大西洋集团的军事基地。
    在汉堡，进步的青年组织“青年行动”举行了“斗争周”，抗议用核武器装备西德国防军。爱国青年在汉堡市内散发传单，呼吁反对西德军国主义化。
    为了调查汉堡居民对波恩军国主义计划所抱的态度，这个组织还在汉堡举行了民意测验。参加测验的居民中有88％都主张缔结对德和约、建立欧洲无核武器地区和反对以核武器装备西德国防军。
    在“斗争周”结束时，青年们在汉堡举行了示威游行。
    在北来因威斯特伐利亚州的吕登舍德市，当地反对服兵役者组织、和平战士组织和受纳粹之害者协会在市中央广场设立了“反对原子死亡斗争岗”。广场上悬挂着这样的标语：“当我国人民遭到原子死亡威胁时，我们是不会安心的”，“多特蒙德地区的原子基地威胁着我们大家”，“我们反对大屠杀的威胁”。
    石勒苏益格——荷尔斯泰因州的居民也在不断斗争，反对把这个州变为北大西洋集团的军事基地。前几天，海利根哈芬港地方当局曾经向西德国防军司令部提出抗议，坚决反对在这个港口驻扎六艘西德海军军舰。
