Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: The teachers and students of the Beijing Dance School formally performed the world-famous ballet "Le Corsaire" at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing tonight. This is the first time this ballet has been performed in China in the more than 100 years since its creation. "Le Corsaire," known as a model of European realist ballet, was originally named "The Pirate." It is based on Byron's poem of the same name and composed by the French composer Adam. It was formally staged in Paris in 1856, and its excellent traditions and essence were developed in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet expert in charge of the choreography of this ballet, Pyotr Andreyevich Gusev, Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic, led the adaptation and rearrangement of "The Pirate" in the Soviet Union and personally played the leading role of Conrad. This time, he redesigned some scenes and selected movements such as "Tiger Leap" and "Spinning Jump" from Chinese classical dance in the ballet, and used Chinese gongs and drums.

The dances in "Le Corsaire" are more diverse than those in "Swan Lake," including many group dances with oriental styles such as Indian, Arabic, Greek, and Algerian, which is different from the European-style dances in "Swan Lake." The teachers and students of the school who performed "Swan Lake" a year ago mostly participated in the performance of "Le Corsaire" this time. Under the guidance of Soviet expert Pyotr Andreyevich Gusev, they worked hard and diligently, and their dancing skills and performance ability have been improved. Bai Shuxiang, a sixth-grade girl, and Zhang Wanzhao, a fifth-grade girl, play the heroine Medora. Bai Shuxiang once starred in "Swan Lake," and most audiences believe that she has made progress compared to her performance as the "White Swan." The "Garden Dance" performed by more than forty lower-grade students, the youngest of whom are only eleven or twelve years old, formed a variety of colorful patterns to the melody of the "Grand Waltz," making the audience happily feel that China's ballet "flowers" are budding.

Peng Zhen, Mayor of Beijing, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, and people from the Beijing literary and art circles watched the performance. Antonov, the Soviet Union's Chargé d'Affaires ad interim in China, and his wife were also invited to watch the performance.

　　北京公演著名芭蕾舞剧“海侠”
    新华社18日讯　今日晚上，北京舞蹈学校师生在北京天桥剧场正式公演了世界著名芭蕾舞剧“海侠”，这是这个舞剧诞生一百多年以来第一次在中国演出。被称为欧洲现实主义芭蕾舞剧典范性作品的“海侠”原名“海盗”，取材于拜仑的同名长诗，由法国作曲家亚当作曲，1856年正式在巴黎上演，它的优良传统和精华在苏联得到发展。
    担任这个舞剧编导的苏联专家俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国功勋演员彼·安·古雪夫，在苏联时曾领导过“海盗”的改编和整理工作，并亲自饰演过主角康拉德。这一次他重新设计了一些场面，并在芭蕾舞中选用了中国古典舞蹈中“虎跳”、“旋子”等动作，使用了中国的锣鼓。
    “海侠”中的舞蹈比“天鹅湖”的舞蹈更多样，其中包括许多印度、阿拉伯、希腊、阿尔及利亚这些东方风格的组舞，这和“天鹅湖”中欧洲风格的舞蹈不同。这个学校在一年以前演出“天鹅湖”的师生们，这次大部分参加了“海侠”的演出。他们在苏联专家彼·安·古雪夫指导下，勤学苦练，舞技和表演能力都有所提高。扮演女主角密多拉的是六年级女学生白淑湘和五年级女学生张婉昭。白淑湘曾经主演过“天鹅湖”，一般观众认为她这次又比饰演“白天鹅”时有进步。由四十多个低年级学生演出的“花园舞”，这些小姑娘中最小的才十一、二岁，她们随着“大华尔兹”舞曲的旋律，整齐地组成了各种彩色缤纷的图案，使观众们欣喜地感到，我国芭蕾舞的“花朵”正在含苞待放。
    北京市市长彭真、文化部副部长钱俊瑞以及北京市文艺界人士，观看了演出。苏联驻中国临时代办安东诺夫和他的夫人也应邀观看了表演。
