Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch: The "Overall Leap Forward Red Flag Emulation Campaign" is about to be further launched among more than two million railway workers nationwide. From 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 30th, more than 400,000 railway workers across the country participated in a wired broadcast conference held by the Ministry of Railways on further developing this campaign, at various railway construction sites, railway factories, and stations.

The railway workers' emotions were extremely high. Representatives and advanced producers from sixteen railway bureaus, factories, design institutes, and other units put forward their proposals, competition conditions, and measures at this mobilization and oath-taking conference. Railway workers from all over the country sent telegrams and long-distance calls to respond to the call of the conference, reporting their achievements to the conference and putting forward their own leap forward goals and guarantee measures. The conference received a total of more than 400 telegrams and calls.

The national railway system's "Overall Leap Forward Red Flag Emulation Campaign" was launched after the National Railway Work Conference held in Beijing in early March this year.

Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Zeng Shan, Minister of the Communications Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting, calling on railway workers across the country to immediately launch a mighty high tide of an all-round leap forward, with everyone striving to be advanced and everyone serving as a model, striving for more railway workers to go to Beijing to participate in the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade.

Representatives from the Ministry of Coal, Metallurgy, Forestry, Grain, and the Railway Corps sent representatives to the meeting to express their congratulations and hopes to railway workers across the country.

The national railway transportation department has successfully completed the transportation plan for the first quarter of this year. Since the beginning of this year, various transportation indicators have been increasing month by month. In March, the average daily loading reached 34,800 cars, which is more than 2,000 cars more per day than the month with the most loading last year. The turnaround time of freight cars was reduced to 2.45 days, which is 0.13 days shorter than the best-performing month last year. However, this year's railway transportation and construction tasks are very heavy. In the second quarter, the freight volume must be completed above 130 million tons, the average daily loading must be completed above 36,500 cars, the turnaround time of freight cars must be shortened to below 2.4 days, the net load weight of freight cars must be increased to 40 tons, the new construction and reconstruction of locomotives must reach 550 units, and the new construction of passenger and freight cars must reach more than 10,000 units. In addition, the tasks of building coal, iron, and forest branch lines, double tracks, hub stations, and surveying and design are also very heavy.

Yu GuangSheng, Vice Minister of Railways, on behalf of the Ministry of Railways, extended warm congratulations to all railway workers and the Railway Corps who had successfully completed the first quarter's transportation plan, and expressed deep gratitude to the support of various localities and brother departments. He proposed: In order to push the national railway's comprehensive leap forward Red Flag emulation campaign to a new high tide, to ensure the needs of the national economy's great leap forward for railway transportation, we must first continue to oppose conservatism, and strive to accelerate the turnaround of locomotives and vehicles and the speed of building cars and roads, while improving quality, ensuring safety, reducing costs, and achieving a comprehensive great leap forward. Secondly, we must vigorously engage in technological revolution and accelerate the improvement of labor productivity. In the second quarter, we must engage in large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization in loading and unloading, road maintenance, construction, and other aspects to reduce heavy physical labor. He proposed to adhere to the principle of the whole country as one chess game and strengthen internal and external cooperation; to advance step by step and continuously improve.

Wang Zhijie, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, put forward the battle slogan of "Seizing Every Second, Scrutinizing Every Gram" to all railway workers.

The Shenyang Railway Bureau's representative presented the following competition conditions to the conference: complete transportation and production tasks on a daily, ten-day, monthly, and quarterly basis, to achieve increased coal and steel production and increased railway transportation; complete 75% of the infrastructure construction tasks before National Day; reduce freight car turnaround time by 12% from April according to the annual plan; increase locomotive daily output by 10% from April according to the annual plan; and achieve a freight car net load of 42.7 tons. Their measures are: vigorously engage in technological revolution, vigorously promote advanced experiences such as high platforms, low cargo positions, and line relocation; and vigorously carry out mechanization of loading and unloading, road maintenance, and construction.

The representative of the Beijing Railway Bureau, which first proposed to fraternal railway bureaus in March to carry out socialist friendship emulation, put forward new goals at the meeting. They will organize four battles this year. The first battle is: to catch up with the advanced indicators of various bureaus across the country before May to welcome "May Day." The second battle is: to over fulfill the transportation tasks in the first half of the year, realize the proposed conditions, and welcome "July 1st." The third battle is: to comprehensively complete various task indicators and welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day. The fourth battle is: to do a good job in winter transportation, comprehensively complete and over fulfill the annual plan, and welcome 1960. In all battles, we must ensure work quality and ensure safety and punctuality.

The representative of the Shanghai Railway Bureau proposed that the Shanghai Railway Bureau must over fulfill the volume of passenger and freight transportation. To this end, from April, the turnaround time of freight cars must be shortened to 1.42 days; the daily output of locomotives must be increased by 10% compared with the annual plan; and the daily car kilometers must be increased by 25 kilometers. They also put forward various specific measures.

The representative of Fuxin Station of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau proposed that they should achieve "three combinations" to ensure improved vehicle utilization efficiency. The three combinations are the combination of leading cadres, technicians, and workers, the combination of production, transportation, and sales, and the combination of loading, unloading, and transportation. They also proposed to widely realize mechanized and semi-mechanized loading to load shed cars with machinery to improve the efficiency of transportation and loading and unloading operations.

Su Guangming, an advanced worker from the Harbin Vehicle Factory, proposed to complete five years' worth of work this year. To this end, he will put forward and implement 60 rationalization proposals this year, including using waste materials to make five sets of indigenous automated machine tools. He also proposed to help the fourteen apprentices in the group reach the level of independent operation as soon as possible.

Lin Yanrong, a locomotive driver from the Longxi Locomotive Depot of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau, representing all locomotive crews, expressed his determination to overcome the Wushaoling Mountains (where there are large slopes with a gradient of 20 per thousand) and plant the red flag on the Qilian Mountains.

At the end of the conference, Vice Minister Lü Zhengcao made a concluding speech.
