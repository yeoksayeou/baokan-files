Population and Manpower
	Ruo Shui

The "population theory" has been talked about enough by some people. Now we should talk about the "manpower theory."

The term "population" is worth pondering. Originally, people are born with more than just a mouth. Why use the mouth as the unit of measurement? It can be seen that the term "population" implies treating people as mere consumers.

From this point of view, since everyone has a mouth and needs to eat, having a large population becomes a burden. It seems easy to prove this. For example, capitalist countries are troubled by population problems: too many mouths! According to recent materials, the number of unemployed workers in the United States is more than six million.

But people come into this world not only with a mouth but also with two hands. According to today's production level in the United States, these six million people, relying on their own hands, can completely supply their own mouths with food, and even have more than enough!

But the strange thing is here: these six million people not only don't have enough to eat, but their two hands also have nothing to do. Are they "loafers"? No. Although their two hands are attached to their own bodies and they are willing to work, they cannot engage in production to supply their own mouths with food. This contradiction between mouth and hand, in other words, is the contradiction between consumption and production.

What is preventing these unemployed workers from using their own hands to feed their own mouths? The capitalist system. Everyone knows that in capitalist countries, the means of production are in the hands of the capitalists. Without the means of production, even if you have hands, you cannot work. To work, you must be employed by the capitalists. If the capitalists do not employ a certain worker, this worker can only idle with his hands and starve. Between the mouths and hands of these unemployed people, there is an external, invisible obstacle, making their own hands helpless to watch their own mouths suffer.

In these countries, there is also a type of person who idles with their hands, but their mouths are busy enjoying themselves. These people are the capitalists. The only thing their hands do is grab the things produced by others and stuff them into their own mouths.

In capitalist countries, the "population" problem is also a "manpower" problem. From the perspective of excessive manpower, it seems that there is too much production; from the perspective of excessive population, it seems that there is too little production. Some people's hands are too busy, while others' hands are too idle. Some people's "mouths" eat too much, while others' "mouths" have nothing to eat. For the capitalist system, this is an unsolvable, fatal contradiction.

The Old Testament creation story records: God said to the people He created, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth." We advocate planned parenthood, but generally speaking, a large population is a good thing. Today's Malthusians regard the multiplication of mankind as an ominous sign. They believe that the way to avoid famine is to reduce the population. In order to reduce the population, they can even promote war!

We Marxists regard people both as consumers and as producers, and primarily as producers. Hands feed mouths, and mouths, when fed, give hands the strength to work. Hands and mouths are interconnected, and production and consumption are unified and inseparable. However, the consumption of the mouth is limited, while the creative ability of the hand is infinite. Therefore, the leading aspect is the hand. As long as the power of the hand can be brought into play, the consumption problem of the mouth can be completely solved. The key to bringing the power of the hand into play lies in the social system.

Our country has more than 600 million mouths. If they are combined, it is truly a huge demand, consuming a lot. However, the combined efforts of more than 600 million hands are equivalent to a giant hand that can create the world, also producing a lot. Last year alone, we produced 750 billion jin of grain, which is proof. Now, our country wants to greatly develop industrial production, greatly develop agricultural production, and also greatly develop cultural and scientific undertakings. We deeply feel that it is not that there are too many people, but that there is a shortage of manpower.

Chinese old novels describe divine and monstrous characters as having "three heads and six arms." Buddhist stories also mention "the Thousand-Handed Guanyin." These imaginations show that people attach great importance to the role of hands. The more hands, the greater the divine power. So, how many "three heads and six arms" and how many "thousand hands and eyes" are our 650 million people equivalent to? Many people in Western countries regard China's Great Leap Forward as an incomprehensible mystery, but the answer is actually very simple. Just as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "Introducing a Cooperative," in addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor.

The problem is not only in quantity but also in quality. New quality will produce new quantity. Before liberation, we also had hundreds of millions of hands. Why did they not play such a big role? That is because most of these hands were producing for the exploiters, and these hands were basically scattered. Now, all hands are working for themselves and are organized and united under the leadership of the Party. This adds much more power than when these hands were scattered. Here, two plus two is indeed not equal to four, but can be equal to five, equal to six, equal to seven, equal to eight, or even more. Marx explained long ago that cooperation can produce a new productive force, which is greater than the sum of individual labor forces when they are scattered. He also said: "Not to mention the new capabilities generated when a majority of forces merge into one overall force. Simple social contact will also stimulate competition in most productive labor, becoming an appropriate stimulus to the spirit of life, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of individual labor." (See "Capital" Volume 1). However, capitalist society only organizes manpower within individual enterprises, and the capitalists' exploitation also greatly damages the enthusiasm of the workers. As for us, we have organized hundreds of millions of hands in their entirety. Factories organize workers, people's communes organize rural manpower, and the state combines all these production units into a whole – the entire country as one chessboard. In addition, as a result of implementing politics in command, the enthusiasm for labor competition has greatly increased, and the initiative of each laborer has been greatly improved. One hand is worth two hands, which is now a common occurrence.

Of course, the reason why our construction can make a Great Leap Forward and have such a high speed cannot ignore the role of the mouth. People have mouths, not only to eat but also to speak. In the eyes of the ruling class in the old society, not only is eating a burden to them, but speaking is also a threat to them.

During the Kuomintang rule, the people had no freedom of speech. The sign "Do Not Discuss State Affairs" posted in teahouses showed that talking about politics would cause trouble. The wish of the reactionary rulers was that the people should only have two hands, not a mouth, only work, neither eat nor speak. This would save the ruling class a lot of trouble, and their empire could be passed down for generations. Although the people's mouths could not be sealed, in the dark old days, the mouths of the majority of people did not fully play their role, not only eating less but also speaking less. Therefore, Lu Xun once lamented "the silent China." Today is different. "The silent China" has become "the boiling China." Everywhere there are debates, everywhere there are big-character posters, everywhere is filled with the enthusiasm of labor, filled with songs of building a new life. The whole world has heard the footsteps of our Great Leap Forward that are shaking the mountains and rivers. Chairman Mao said, "More people, more discussion, high enthusiasm, and great drive." Isn't this the benefit of having more mouths?

We are liberating our minds step by step, so that we dare to think; liberating our mouths, so that we dare to speak. Only in this way will we be able to let go of our hands – dare to do. Today, the situation in our country where 500 million farmers are struggling to feed themselves shows that the hands of the majority of people are not liberated enough, and labor productivity is not high enough, and they are still busy supplying mouths. Therefore, the liberation of hands is an important issue. To liberate hands, we must also rely on hand-brain cooperation, using tools and machines to replace part of the hands and expand the capabilities of the hands. In the near future, we will carry out mechanization and electrification in the countryside, allowing machines to replace many human hands. At that time, we will be able to free up a large number of hands from agricultural labor. Eating is a basic need of people, but besides this, people also have other material and spiritual needs. Hands should not only serve the mouth but also serve the eyes and ears, allowing the eyes to read books, see paintings, and watch movies, and allowing the ears to listen to operas and listen to music. The more society develops, the higher and more diverse people's material and spiritual needs become. When we reach communist society, people's minds and hands will be further greatly liberated. At that time, society will not only be able to completely distribute food according to the needs of each person's mouth but will also give every pair of hands sufficient time to engage in free and creative labor. This is our goal.

　　人口和人手
    若水
    “人口论”已经被有些人谈论得够多了，现在我们应当谈谈“人手论”。
    “人口”这个名词是很值得玩味的。本来，人生下来并不只有一张嘴巴，为什么单单用口来作计数单位呢？可见在“人口”这个名词里，隐含着把人当作单纯消费者的意思。
    从这个观点看，既然每个人都有一张嘴巴，都要吃饭，于是人多就成了负担。要证明这一点好像也很容易，比如资本主义国家就在闹人口问题：嘴巴太多了！据最近的材料，美国失业工人的数字在六百万以上。
    可是人到这个世界上来，不只带了一张嘴巴，而且带了两只手。照美国今天的生产水平来看，这六百多万人只要依靠自己的双手，供应自己嘴巴吃饭的需要是完全没有问题的，而且还绰绰有余呢！
    但怪事就出在这里：这六百多万人不但嘴巴没有足够的东西吃，两只手也没有事情做。他们是“游手好闲”的人吗？不是。不过虽然他们的两只手是长在自己身上的，他们也愿意工作，可是他们却不能从事生产，来供应自己的嘴巴吃饭。这个口与手的矛盾，换句话说，就是消费和生产的矛盾。
    是什么东西阻止这些失业工人用自己的手来供养自己的口呢？资本主义制度。大家都知道：在资本主义国家，生产手段掌握在资本家手里，而没有生产手段，有手也不能做工，要做工就得受资本家雇佣；如果资本家不雇佣某个工人，这个工人就只好闲着双手，饿着肚皮。在这些失业者的口与手之间，横隔着一个外界的、无形的障碍，使得自己的手坐视自己的口受苦而无能为力。
    在这些国家里还有一种人也是闲着双手，可是他们的嘴巴却忙于享受。这些人就是资本家。他们的手所做的只是一件事情，就是把别人生产出来的东西抓过来塞到自己嘴巴里。
    在资本主义国家里，“人口”问题同时就是“人手”问题。从人“手”过剩来看，似乎是生产得太多了；从人“口”过剩来看，生产得又太少了。有的人手太忙，有的人手又太闲。有的人“口”吃得太多，有的人“口”又没有什么可吃。对于资本主义制度来说，这是一个无法解决的致命的矛盾。
    旧约创世记载：上帝对他所创造的人说：“你们要生养众多，在地上昌盛繁茂。”我们主张有计划的生育，但总的说来，人多是好事。今天的马尔萨斯主义者却把人类的生养众多看成了不祥之兆，他们认为避免饥馑的办法是减少人口，为了减少人口，甚至可以推行战争！
    我们马克思主义者把人既看作消费者，又看作生产者，而且首先看作生产者。手供养口吃饭，口吃了饭又使手有气力做工。手与口是互相联系的，生产与消费是统一不可分的。但是，口的消费数量是有限的，手的创造能力却是无穷的，所以主导的一面是手。只要能发挥手的力量，口的消费问题是完全能够解决的，而要发挥手的力量，关键在于社会制度。
    我国六亿多张嘴，如果合并起来，那真正是一张海口，消费得很多。可是，六亿多双手联合起来，那也等于一双开天辟地的巨手，生产得也很多。去年一年生产了七千五百亿斤粮食，便是证明。现在，我国要大大发展工业生产，大大发展农业生产，还要大大发展文化科学事业，深深感到不是人口太多，而是人手不足。
    中国旧小说里形容神怪式的人物，总说他有“三头六臂”。佛教故事里面还有“千手千眼观士音”。这些想像表明人们十分重视手的作用，手愈多，神通便愈广大。那么我们六亿五千万人该相当于多少“三头六臂”，多少“千手千眼”呢？西方国家里有不少人把中国的大跃进看成一个不可理解的谜，而其实谜底很简单，正像毛泽东同志在“介绍一个合作社”的文章中指出的：除了党的领导，六亿人民是一个决定因素。
    问题还不仅在数量，而且在质量，新的质量会产生新的数量。解放前我们也有几万万双手，为什么没有发挥这样大的作用呢？那是因为这些手大部分是为剥削者进行生产，而且这些手基本上是分散的。现在，所有的手都为自己工作，而且在党的领导之下组织起来了，联合起来了。这就比这些手各自分散时要平添许多力量。在这里二加二确确实实不等于四，而可以等于五，等于六，等于七，等于八，或者更多。马克思早就说明，协作能产生出一种新的生产力，比个别劳动力分散时发挥的总和要大。他又说：“且不说多数力融合为一个总体力时所生出的新能力。单纯的社会接触，也会在大多数生产劳动上，引起竞争心，成为生活精神的适当刺激，从而，增进各个人劳动的效能。”（见“资本论”第一卷）但是，资本主义社会只是在单独的企业内部把人手组织起来，而资本家的剥削也大大损伤了工人的积极性。至于我们，是把几亿人手全部组织起来了。工厂把工人组织起来，人民公社把农村人手组织起来，而国家又把这一切生产单位组成一个总体，——全国一盘棋。加上实行了政治挂帅的结果，劳动竞赛的热情大大高涨，每个劳动者的积极性大大提高。一双手顶两双手，现在已是常事了。
    当然，我们的建设所以能够大跃进，所以有如此高的速度，也不能忽视嘴巴的作用。人长了嘴巴，不光要吃饭，而且要讲话，在旧社会的统治阶级看来，不光要吃饭对他们是一种负担，要讲话也对他们是一种威胁。
    在国民党统治期间，人民没有言论自由，茶馆里贴着“莫谈国是”的条子，就表明谈论政治是会闯祸的。反动统治者的心愿是：人民最好只长一双手，不长嘴巴，光做工，既不吃饭也不说话，这就可以省去统治阶级的许多麻烦，他们的江山也就可以传诸万世了。虽然人民的嘴巴是封不住的，但在黑暗的旧时代，多数人的嘴巴的确没有充分发挥作用，不但吃得少，而且说得少，因此鲁迅曾经慨叹过“无声的中国”。今天不同了，“无声的中国”变成“沸腾的中国”了，到处是辩论会，到处是大字报，到处洋溢着劳动的热情，洋溢着建设新生活的歌声，全世界都听到了我们震撼山河的大跃进的脚步声音。毛主席说，“人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”这难道不是口多的好处么？
    我们正在一步进一步地解放我们的头脑，使我们敢想；解放我们的嘴巴，使我们敢说；只有这样，我们才会放开自己的手——敢做。今天我国五亿农民弄饭吃这个局面表明多数人的手还不够解放，劳动生产率还不够高，还只是在忙于供应嘴巴。所以，手的解放是个重要问题。要解放手，还要靠手脑合作，用工具和机器来代替一部分手，来扩大手的能力。不久的将来，我们要在农村里搞机械化、电气化，让机器来代替许多人手，那时候，我们就可以从农业劳动中腾出大批人手来。吃饭是人的基本需要，但除此以外，人还有其他物质需要和精神需要。手不只是要为口服务，而且要为眼服务，为耳服务，让眼睛看书，看画，看电影，让耳朵听戏，听音乐。社会越是往前发展，人的物质需要和精神需要越是高，越是多样化。到了共产主义社会，人的头脑和双手会进一步大大地解放，那时，社会不但可以完全按照各人嘴巴的需要来分配食物，而且将使每一双手有充分的时间来从事自由的创造性的劳动。这就是我们的目标。
