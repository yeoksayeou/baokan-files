Albania's National Economy to Develop Rapidly
　　Thirty-Six Industrial Construction Projects to be Completed and Put into Production This Year
　　Rural Areas Take Many Measures to Promote Further Growth in Agricultural Production
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The Albanian national economy will develop rapidly on a larger scale in 1959. Albania has formulated new development plans in industry, agriculture, scientific research, and personnel training.

    Accelerate the Pace of Industrial Construction
    1959 is the year Albania's socialist construction enters a new stage. This year, the total industrial output value will reach 30.55 billion leks (Albanian currency), an increase of 17% over last year, reaching the target for 1960. The main projects this year include 54 items, including the Bistrica and Shkumbin hydroelectric power stations, the Vlora cement plant, a copper smelter, the Tirana food complex, five brick kilns, and thirteen wineries. The construction of these factories and mines is proceeding rapidly, and 36 of them will be completed and put into production this year.

    Further Increase Agricultural Production
    This year, Albania's agricultural production will have a great development. The total agricultural output value will reach 32.3 billion leks, an increase of 26% over last year. Within this year, grain production will increase by 64%, cotton will increase by 34%, and sugar beet production is planned to increase by 78%. Currently, rural areas are taking many measures to promote a surge in agricultural production, including merging small cooperatives into large ones, accelerating agricultural mechanization, and building water conservancy projects.

    Recently, near the city of Saranda, eight agricultural production cooperatives merged into one large cooperative, including 670 households, 3,250 members, and a cultivated area of over 5,000 hectares. In other parts of Albania, such as Lushnjë, Vlora, and Korçë, there are also cases of small cooperatives merging into large ones.

    This year, the state's investment in agriculture will greatly exceed last year, and the majority of the investment will be used for water conservancy construction and agricultural mechanization. Albania is currently building the Mao Chai Que, Fier, Loskovitz, and Du Zhi four major water conservancy projects. After the completion of this series of projects, more than 43,000 hectares of land will be irrigated, the soil of 51,600 hectares of land will be improved, and more than 15,000 hectares of new cultivated land can be added.

    This year, the agricultural machinery received by the Albanian countryside will increase by 18% compared to last year, which is also one of the main conditions conducive to completing this year's agricultural production targets.

    Vigorously Carry out Scientific Research
    In 1959, Albania's scientific research work is greater than in previous years, and the scope of research topics is very broad, mainly focusing on the investigation of natural resources and their development, such as the study of geology and its development results, research on spices and medicinal materials, research on pasture planting, and various special product plants.

    Albanian scientific workers are also preparing to study how to improve the production efficiency of machinery and equipment, construction, and water conservancy systems.

    In addition, a series of studies will be conducted on Albanian history, language, literature, and economy based on Marxism-Leninism.

    Archaeological work is also being carried out on a large scale, with the focus on the ancient city of Apollonia and Bashari Mang in the city of Vlora.

    Strengthen the Training of Construction Personnel
    In order to meet the requirements of rapid economic development, the Albanian Party and government are constantly strengthening the training of construction personnel in various fields. At present, Albania has thirteen times more engineers, agronomists, animal husbandry experts, and economists than before the war. By 1960, it is expected that more than 2,300 new cadres with higher technical levels and 10,000 cadres with intermediate technical levels will be trained.

    This year, education in Albania's universities and colleges will have a great development: the number of primary school students will increase by 14%, the number of middle school students will increase by 20%, and the number of university students will reach 3,200.

　　阿尔巴尼亚国民经济将有迅速发展
　　今年将有三十六个工业建设项目完工并投入生产
　　各地农村采取许多措施促使农业生产进一步增长
    本报讯　1959年阿尔巴尼亚的国民经济将以更大规模迅速发展。在工业、农业、科学研究和培养建设人材等方面，阿尔巴尼亚都制定了新的发展计划。
    加快工业建设速度
    1959年是阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设进入新阶段的一年。今年工业总产值将达三百零五亿五千万里克（阿币），比去年增加17％，达到1960年的指标。今年的主要工程计有五十四项，其中包括比斯特列茨和希库比水电站、发罗那水泥厂、炼铜厂、地拉那食品联合工厂、五座砖窑、十三座造酒厂等。这些厂矿建筑都在加速进行中，其中三十六项今年就要完工并将投入生产。
    进一步提高农业生产
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚农业生产将有很大的发展。农业总产值将达三百二十三亿里克，比去年增加26％。在这一年内，粮食要增产64％，棉花将增产34％，而甜菜计划增产78％。目前，各地农村为促进农业生产高涨而采取了许多措施，其中包括小社并大社、加速农业机械化和兴修水利等。
    最近，在萨兰达城附近，有八个农业生产合作社并成了一个大社，包括六百七十户，三千二百五十个社员，耕地面积达五千余公顷。在阿尔巴尼亚其他地方，如鲁什尼他、发罗那和科尔察等地，也都有小社并大社的情况。
    今年，国家在农业方面的投资将大大超过去年，投资的绝大部分是用来兴修水利和农业机械化的。现在阿尔巴尼亚正在修建茂柴却、费埃尔、洛斯库维茨和都芝四大水利工程。这一系列工程完成后，将使四万三千多公顷土地得到灌溉，五万一千六百公顷土地的土壤得到改良，还可以增加一万五千多公顷的新耕地。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚农村得到的农业机器将比去年增加18％，这也是有利于完成今年农业生产指标的主要条件之一。
    大力开展科学研究
    1959年阿尔巴尼亚的科学研究工作比往年都大，研究的专题范围很广，主要是自然资源的调查及其开发工作，例如，地质及其开发结果的研究，有关香料和药料的研究，有关牧草种植以及各种特产植物的研究等。
    阿尔巴尼亚的科学工作者还准备研究如何提高机器设备、建筑和水利系统的生产效率问题。
    此外，还要在马克思列宁主义的基础上，对阿尔巴尼亚的历史、语言、文学和经济进行一系列研究。
    考古工作也正在大规模地进行中，这项工作的重点是在古城阿博洛尼和发罗那城的巴夏里芒。
    加强建设人材的培养
    为了满足经济迅速发展的要求，阿尔巴尼亚党和政府不断加强各方面建设人材的培养工作。目前，阿尔巴尼亚的工程师、农学家、畜牧业家和经济学家比战前多了十三倍。到1960年，预计将培养出二千三百多名具有高等技术水平的新干部师和一万名具有中等技术水平的干部。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚大中学校的教育将有很大的发展：小学生将增加14％，中学生将增加20％，大学生的人数将达到三千二百名。
