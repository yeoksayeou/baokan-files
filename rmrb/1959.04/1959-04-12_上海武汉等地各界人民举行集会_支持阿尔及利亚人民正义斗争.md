　　The Algerian military delegation, which is currently on a friendly visit to Shanghai, also attended the meeting.
　　Also attending the meeting today were Major General Xiong Yingtang, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison, Song Richang, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations.
　　At 9:00 a.m., when all the distinguished members of the Algerian military delegation, headed by Omar Oussedik, Secretary of State of the provisional government of the Republic of Algeria, stepped onto the rostrum, the audience burst into thunderous applause, welcoming the friendly envoys of the heroic Algerian people from the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle in Africa.

Ba Jin, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He said: The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Algerian people, and regard the victory of the Algerian people's struggle as their own victory. The experience of the Chinese people proves that all imperialists are paper tigers. We believe that the Algerian people will surely achieve the final victory, and the flag of freedom and independence will surely be planted all over the heroic Algeria in battle. Then, the audience welcomed Omar Oussedik, head of the Algerian military delegation, to speak with thunderous applause. He said: The Algerian people, who are persisting in a long-term national liberation struggle, must restore Algerian national independence and smash the chains on their bodies in the flames of struggle.

The victory of the Algerian people has also greatly encouraged the struggle for independence of all nations still suffering from colonial oppression.

They pointed out that all imperialists are paper tigers. Supported by US imperialism, the French colonialists are rampaging on the land of Algeria, attempting to subdue the Algerian people with inhumane massacres and the establishment of hundreds of concentration camps and other brutal means. In fact, this kind of vicious and bloody means further demonstrates the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of imperialism.
　　Yuan Zhenhai, a national labor model and worker at Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Zhao Yulian, a Wuhan labor model and female worker, said that the broad masses of workers in Wuhan expressed their utmost indignation at the French colonialists' brutal suppression of the Algerian people.

    今天参加大会的还有上海警备副司令员熊应堂少将，上海市副市长宋日昌和各民主党派人民团体的负责人等。
    上午九时，当以阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府国务秘书奥马尔·乌西迪克为首的阿尔及利亚军事代表团全体贵宾走上主席台时，全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声，欢迎来自非洲反帝斗争最前线的英雄的阿尔及利亚人民的友谊使者。一群少先队员涌上主席台，向贵宾们献花。
    今天大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会副主席钟民主持。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会副主席巴金在会上讲了话。他说：中国人民一向同情和支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，把阿尔及利亚人民斗争的胜利看成是自己的胜利。中国人民的经验证明，一切帝国主义都是纸老虎，我们相信，阿尔及利亚人民一定会取得最后的胜利，自由和独立的旗帜一定会插遍战斗的英雄的阿尔及利亚。接着，全场以雷动般的掌声欢迎阿尔及利亚军事代表团团长奥马尔·乌西迪克讲话。他说：坚持长期民族解放斗争的阿尔及利亚人民，一定要在斗争的火焰中，恢复阿尔及利亚民族独立和粉碎自己身上的锁链。
    奥马尔·乌西迪克说：阿中两国人民的友谊的发展将大大地促进世界和平事业。

    新华社武汉11日电　武汉市各界代表今天举行座谈会，支持阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争。
    这个座谈会是政协和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会武汉地方组织联合举行的，各民主党派地方组织和各人民团体的负责人、宗教界代表、劳动模范等数十人参加了座谈会。
    科学界代表、武汉工学院院长周炳章在发言中指出，阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争是正义的，他们的每一个胜利都是我国人民和全世界进步人类的共同胜利。阿尔及利亚人民的胜利，也大大鼓舞了仍在遭受殖民主义压迫的各民族争取独立的斗争。
    民革湖北省委主任委员陈离、民建武汉市委主任委员陈经畬在发言中，对阿尔及利亚人民在反对法国殖民者的斗争中所取得的巨大胜利，表示祝贺。他们指出，一切帝国主义都是纸老虎，法国殖民者在美帝国主义支持下，在阿尔及利亚的土地上张牙舞爪，用灭绝人性的屠杀和建立数以百计的集中营等残酷手段，妄图制服阿尔及利亚人民，其实，这种穷凶极恶的血腥手段更表明了帝国主义的外强中干。
    全国劳动模范、武钢工人袁振海和武汉劳动模范、女工赵玉莲说，武汉广大工人对法国殖民者残酷镇压阿尔及利亚人民的罪行，表示无比愤慨。
