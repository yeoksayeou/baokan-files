Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 8th: The Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee held its first plenary session in its office building at 11:00 this morning to exercise the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet. The meeting was presided over by Bainqen Erdini, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee. All members in Lhasa attended the meeting, and the heads of all departments, committees, and offices under the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region also attended the meeting as non-voting delegates.

Bainqen Erdini, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Zhang Guohua, Vice Chairman, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General, delivered reports at the meeting. Vice Chairman Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal was recuperating in the hospital due to illness, and his written report was read at the meeting.

When Bainqen Erdini announced the opening of the first plenary session of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region to exercise the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet, warm applause broke out in the hall.

Bainqen Erdini: We must resolutely complete the tasks put forward in the State Council's order
Bainqen Erdini first gave a report to the meeting. He said: "Because the majority of the Kalons and the upper-level reactionary group in the local government of Tibet, colluding with imperialism and various counter-revolutionary elements, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and carried out criminal activities betraying the motherland, betraying the Tibetan people, and infringing upon national interests, the State Council issued an order on March 28 to dissolve the local government of Tibet and entrust the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region with the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet, and ordered the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion in the Tibetan region and maintain social order. All these measures are completely in line with the wishes and interests of all monks and lay people in Tibet, are conducive to the progress and development of all aspects of construction in the Tibetan region, and are completely correct. We warmly support this order and will resolutely complete the various tasks put forward in the order."

Bainqen Erdini said: "Since the day the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion launched by the reactionary forces in Lhasa was completely quelled, the situation in all aspects of Tibet has undergone tremendous changes. We can be sure that this change will further consolidate the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities, and enable the Tibetan people to embark on the road of prosperity and happiness of socialism at an early date. Under this new situation, in accordance with the matters stipulated in the State Council's order, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region must hold a plenary session to discuss and resolve future tasks and related issues, so as to better shoulder its tasks."

Bainqen Erdini said: "There are still a certain number of armed rebels in Tibet who are still burning, killing, looting, raping women, persecuting patriotic and progressive people, and carrying out criminal activities that harm the people and betray the motherland. The State Council has ordered the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion. Fully supporting and assisting the People's Liberation Army in carrying out the work of suppressing the rebellion is a major task for our Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and all the Tibetan people at present." He said: "The Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the offices at all levels of the base Qiao must lead and organize all monks and lay people to do a good job in supporting the work."

Bainqen Erdini said: "From now on, we must break down old boundaries and old ideas, eliminate factors that are not conducive to unity, and unite on a new basis. This basis is patriotism, progress, and taking the socialist road. That is to say, we must unite under the leadership of the Communist Party, study together, and make progress together."

In his report, Bainqen Erdini praised the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government's policy of freedom of religious belief, praised the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet for conscientiously implementing this policy, and severely condemned the scum of the religious circles for participating in the rebellion under the guise of religion. He said that all monks, as long as they are patriotic, law-abiding, and abide by their duties, can be protected by the government.

At the end of his report, Bainqen Erdini proposed a moment of silence for Khenchung Sonam Gyaltsen, a patriotic and progressive Lama and member of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, who was killed by the rebels. At this time, the whole audience stood in silence to express deep condolences for the sacrifice of Khenchung Sonam Gyaltsen.

Zhang Guohua: The convening of this meeting is of great historical significance for resolutely quelling the rebellion in Tibet and building a democratic and socialist new Tibet
Next, Vice Chairman Zhang Guohua delivered a report. He said: "Today, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region held the first meeting of the committee to exercise the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet under the personal chairmanship of Acting Chairman Bainqen Erdini. The convening of this meeting is of great historical significance for resolutely quelling the rebellion in Tibet, further consolidating the unity of the motherland and strengthening the unity between all ethnic groups, and for building a democratic and socialist new Tibet."

In his report, Zhang Guohua pointed out that the criminal activities carried out by the original local government of Tibet that undermined the unity of the motherland, undermined national unity, and violated the will of the Tibetan people were by no means accidental, but premeditated for a long time. He said: When the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet was signed in 1951, the central government made huge concessions to the original local government of Tibet. The agreement mainly required the original local government of Tibet to resolutely break away from the control of imperialism and return to the big family of the motherland. With regard to the handling of internal relations and internal affairs in Tibet, the central government adopted an extremely lenient approach in accordance with its established policy of national equality and unity. Even so, the upper-level reactionaries in Tibet still strongly opposed it; although the original local government of Tibet had expressed its support for the implementation of the agreement in letters, telegrams, and verbally, in reality it opposed the implementation of the agreement with various excuses, so that some important provisions were never implemented.

Zhang Guohua said: "All ethnic groups in our country must carry out social reforms and take the socialist road, which is definitely unchangeable. However, the time, steps, and methods of reform should be determined according to the specific conditions of each ethnic group. The central government believes that social reforms in Tibet can be carried out through peaceful consultation by the Tibetan people and public leaders who are connected with the people. This spirit is stipulated in Article 11 of the agreement, but the upper-level reactionaries in Tibet are stubbornly opposed to social reforms, and the original local government of Tibet actually adopted an attitude of opposition to reforms, which has resulted in the fact that the lives of the Tibetan people are still very hard. In order to promote the awareness of the original local government of Tibet, the central government patiently negotiated and waited, and announced at the end of 1956 that it would not implement democratic reforms during the second five-year plan. However, the local government of Tibet and the upper-level reactionary group were not satisfied and even went so far as to carry out the activity of 'never changing forever'. All these show that the original local government of Tibet and the upper-level reactionary group have always disregarded the interests of the vast number of monks and lay people, and fundamentally opposed the agreement and the socialist system."

In his report, Zhang Guohua used a large number of facts to expose the criminal activities of the original local government of Tibet and the upper-level reactionary group, who had long been engaged in betraying the motherland, undermining the unity of the motherland, and undermining national unity, and used concrete facts to illustrate that the central government had always adopted an attitude of striving for education, patient waiting, and leniency towards the original local government of Tibet. However, the original local government of Tibet and the upper-level reactionary group regarded the central government's attitude as "weakness" and "deception", and even more arrogantly carried out traitorous activities, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and launched a full-scale armed rebellion.

Zhang Guohua said: "Under such circumstances that it could not be tolerated, and when the hope for a peaceful settlement had been completely destroyed by the Tibetan traitors, in order to unify the motherland, safeguard national unity, and completely liberate the Tibetan working people, the central government had no choice but to adopt the policy of completely quelling the rebellion and ordered the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet to suppress the traitorous groups in Tibet on March 20. At present, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet is continuing to heroically and tenaciously quell the armed rebellion in other areas in order to complete this glorious task, with the support of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, after achieving victory in suppressing the rebellion in the Lhasa area."

Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal: All of us monks should support the State Council's order with practical actions of patriotism and law-abiding
Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said in his written report to the meeting that he was very happy to convene the plenary session of the committee, but he could not attend in person because of his poor health. He expressed his full agreement with the several proposals to be discussed and adopted at this meeting, and sincerely supported the order of the State Council.

Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal said: "In the eight since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have been very concerned about the progress and development of Tibet and have given great help in many ways. As a result, Tibet's political, economic, cultural and other construction undertakings have all achieved certain development, and the lives of the Tibetan people have also begun to improve." He said that the original local government of Tibet and the upper-level reactionary group, in order to maintain their ruling position of exploiting and oppressing the working people, vainly attempted to place the Tibetan people under the dark rule of imperialism and reactionaries again. He said that these were all contrary to the will of the Tibetan people, thus arousing great indignation and strong opposition from monks and lay people throughout Tibet.

Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal said: "The Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have always protected patriotic and law-abiding temples and insisted on implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief. All of us monks should continue to support the State Council's order with practical actions of patriotism and law-abiding, and use this to answer the central government's care and love."

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme: We must contribute all our strength to assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion
Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, talked in his report about the course of the armed rebellion launched by the local government of Tibet and the upper-level reactionary group after March 10, betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people, and narrated the consistent patience and tolerance adopted by the central government towards the local government of Tibet before the local government of Tibet openly rebelled. He said: "The local government of Tibet and the upper-level reactionary group, colluding with imperialism and bandits, betraying the motherland, betraying the people, undermining the unity of the motherland, and causing the Tibetan people to return to a dark and impoverished situation, enslaved by imperialism, all these crimes cannot be tolerated by the Tibetan monks and lay people and patriotic progressive people."

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said: "Thoroughly quelling the rebellion in the Tibetan region is our main task at present. Therefore, we must contribute all our strength to lead and organize all Tibetan monks and lay people to actively assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion." He pointed out that the administrative personnel at all levels of the original local government of Tibet should hand over weapons and documents undamaged and support the orders of the military control committees at all levels.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme finally chanted "Long live the happiness and new life of all the Tibetan people", "Long live the great mother

   西藏自治区筹委会行使西藏地方政府职权
   紧密团结起来建设新西藏
   第一次全体会议号召僧俗人民全力支援解放军彻底平定叛乱
   欢庆西藏历史展开新的一页向着民主和社会主义的道路前进
    新华社拉萨8日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会今天上午十一时在它的办公大楼里召开了行使西藏地方政府职权的第一次全体委员会议。会议由代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼主持，在拉萨的全体委员都出席了会议，自治区筹委会所属各厅、委、处的负责人也列席了会议。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼，副主任委员张国华和副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美，在会上作了报告。副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰因病正在医院休养，会议宣读了他的书面报告。
    当班禅额尔德尼宣布西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权的第一次全体委员会议开幕的时候，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
  班禅额尔德尼：我们要坚决完成国务院
                  命令中提出的各项任务
    班禅额尔德尼首先向会议作了报告。他说：“由于西藏地方政府中的多数噶伦和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和各种反革命分子，劫持达赖喇嘛，撕毁和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，进行了背叛祖国、背叛西藏人民、侵犯民族利益的罪恶活动，国务院于3月28日发布命令，解散西藏地方政府，责成西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权，并责令人民解放军西藏军区彻底平息西藏地区的叛乱，维护社会秩序。这一切措施，是完全符合西藏全体僧俗人民的愿望和利益的，是有利于西藏地区各方面建设事业的进步和发展的，是完全正确的。我们热烈拥护这一命令，并要坚决完成命令中提出的各项任务。”
    班禅额尔德尼说：“从反动势力在拉萨发动的反革命武装叛乱被彻底平息的那一天起，西藏各方面的情况正在起着巨大的变化。我们可以肯定，这一变化将更加巩固祖国的统一和民族的团结，使西藏人民早日走向繁荣幸福的社会主义道路。在这新的情况下，遵照国务院命令中规定的事项，西藏自治区筹备委员会必须举行一次全体会议，商讨并解决今后的任务以及与此有关的问题，以便更好地担负起自己的任务。”
    班禅额尔德尼说：“在西藏还有一定数量的武装叛乱分子，他们仍在烧杀抢劫，奸淫妇女，迫害爱国进步人士，进行着残害人民、背叛祖国的罪恶活动。国务院已命令人民解放军西藏军区彻底平息叛乱。全力支援和协助人民解放军进行平叛工作，这是目前我们西藏自治区筹备委员会和全体西藏人民的一项主要任务。”他说：“西藏自治区筹备委员会和各基巧级办事处必须领导和组织全体僧俗人民，做好支援工作。”
    班禅额尔德尼说：“今后我们必须打破旧有的界线和旧的观念，消除那些不利于团结的因素，在新的基础上团结起来，这个基础就是爱国进步和走社会主义道路。也就是说我们必须团结在共产党领导之下，共同学习，共同进步。”
    班禅额尔德尼在报告中赞扬了中国共产党和中央人民政府的宗教信仰自由政策，赞扬进藏人民解放军认真贯彻了这一政策，并严厉斥责宗教界的败类披着宗教外衣参加叛乱。他说，所有僧众，只要爱国守法，安分守己，都可以受到政府的保护。
    班禅额尔德尼结束报告时，提议为被叛乱分子打死的爱国进步喇嘛、西藏自治区筹备委员会宗教事务委员会委员堪穷索朗降措致哀。这时全场肃立，对堪穷索朗降措的牺牲表示深切哀悼。
  张国华：这次会议的召开，对坚决平定
            西藏叛乱，建设民主和社会主
          义的新西藏有重大历史意义
    接着，副主任委员张国华作了报告。他说：“今天西藏自治区筹备委员会在代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼的亲自主持下召开了筹委会行使西藏地方政府职权的第一次委员会议，这次会议的召开，对坚决平定西藏叛乱，进一步巩固祖国统一和加强各族人民之间的团结，对于建设民主和社会主义的新西藏有着重大的历史意义。”
    张国华在报告中指出，原西藏地方政府进行的破坏祖国统一、破坏民族团结、违反西藏人民意志的罪恶活动，绝非出于偶然，而是蓄谋已久的。他说：在1951年签订关于和平解放西藏办法的协议时，中央就对原西藏地方政府作了巨大让步，在协议中主要要求原西藏地方政府坚决脱离帝国主义羁绊，回到祖国的大家庭中来。而对西藏内部关系和内部事务的处理，中央则一本既定的民族平等团结政策，采取了极为宽大的办法。即使这样，西藏上层反动分子也还是极力反对；原西藏地方政府虽然曾在函电中和口头上表示拥护执行协议，然而实际上却以各种借口反对协议的实行，以至一些重要条文始终未能付诸实施。
    张国华说：“我国各民族都必须进行社会改革，走社会主义道路，这是肯定不移的。但是改革的时间、步骤和方式，应当根据各民族的具体条件去决定。中央认为西藏的社会改革可以由西藏人民和同人民有联系的公众领袖和平协商进行，这个精神在协议第十一条中已有规定，但是西藏的上层反动分子却一味反对社会改革，而原西藏地方政府对于改革在实际上也是采取反对的态度，致使西藏人民的生活至今仍然很苦。中央为了促使原西藏地方政府觉悟，还是耐心地协商等待，并于1956年底宣布在第二个五年计划期间不实行民主改革。但是西藏地方政府和上层反动集团还不满足，而又得寸进尺狂妄地进行什么‘永远不改’的活动。所有这些都说明，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团是一贯不顾广大僧俗人民的利益，根本反对协议，反对社会主义制度的。”
    张国华在报告中用大量事实揭露了原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团长期以来一直进行着的背叛祖国、破坏祖国统一、破坏民族团结的罪恶活动，并用具体事实说明中央对原西藏地方政府一直是采取争取教育、耐心等待和宽大为怀的态度。而原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团却把中央的这种态度当成是“软弱”、“可欺”，竟然更加嚣张地进行叛国活动，劫持达赖喇嘛，发动了全面的武装叛乱。
    张国华说：“中央在这种忍无可忍的情况下，在和平解决的希望已被西藏叛国分子彻底摧毁的情况下，为了祖国的统一，为了维护民族团结，为了西藏劳动人民的彻底解放，不得不采取彻底平息叛乱的方针，于3月20日命令人民解放军驻西藏部队讨伐西藏的叛国集团。目前人民解放军驻西藏部队为完成这一光荣任务，在全国各族人民的支援下，在平息拉萨地区叛乱取得胜利后，正继续英勇顽强地平息其他地区的武装叛乱。”
  帕巴拉·卓列朗杰：我们全体僧众应以
                    爱国守法的实际行
                    动拥护国务院命令
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰活佛在他向会议的书面报告中说，他对召开全体委员会议非常高兴，但是由于他身体不好，不能亲自来参加。他表示完全同意要在这次会议上讨论通过的几项议案，并衷心地拥护国务院的命令。
    帕巴拉·卓列朗杰说：“西藏和平解放八年来，中国共产党和中央人民政府非常关怀西藏的进步和发展，曾多方给予大力帮助，因而西藏的政治、经济、文化等建设事业都获得了一定的发展，西藏人民的生活也开始有所改善。”他说，但是原西藏地方政府与上层反动集团为了维持他们剥削和压迫劳动人民的统治地位，妄想把西藏人民重新置于帝国主义和反动派的黑暗统治之下。他说，这些都是违背西藏人民的意志的，因而引起了全藏僧俗人民的极大愤慨和强烈反对。
    帕巴拉·卓列朗杰说：“中国共产党和中央人民政府一向是保护爱国守法的寺庙和坚持执行宗教信仰自由政策的，我们全体僧众应继续以爱国守法的实际行动来拥护国务院的命令，并以此来回答中央的关怀和爱护。”
  阿沛·阿旺晋美：我们要贡献一切力量协
                    助解放军平息叛乱
    自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美在他的报告里谈到了西藏地方政府和上层反动集团在3月10日以后公开发动背叛祖国、背叛西藏人民的武装叛乱的经过情况，并且叙述了中央在西藏地方政府未公开叛乱前，对西藏地方政府一贯采取的耐心等待、宽大为怀的态度。他说：“西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和叛匪，背叛祖国，背叛人民，破坏祖国统一，使西藏人民重新回到黑暗贫困的境地，受帝国主义的奴役，这一切罪行是西藏僧俗人民和爱国进步人士所不能容忍的。”
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说：“彻底平息西藏地区的叛乱是我们当前的主要任务，因而我们一定要贡献出一切力量，领导和组织西藏全体僧俗人民积极协助人民解放军平息叛乱。”他指出，原西藏地方政府的各级行政人员，应无损地交出武器、文件，拥护各级军事管制委员会的命令。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美最后高呼“全西藏人民的幸福和新生万岁”，“伟大祖国、中国共产党和毛主席万岁”。
    在阿沛·阿旺晋美报告结束后，自治区筹备委员会的委员纷纷发言，先后发言的有：常务委员拉敏·益喜楚臣、委员噶丹赤巴·土登滚噶、常务委员詹东·计晋美、委员桑颇·才旺仁增、委员阿沛·才旦卓噶、常务委员朗顿·滚噶旺秋、委员王沛生（回族）。
    拉敏·益喜楚臣说：“今天是西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权的第一次会议，它标志着西藏的历史正在展开新的一页，西藏人民将从此向着民主和社会主义的新西藏英勇迈进。”
    六十九岁的噶丹赤巴·土登滚噶在发言中表示热烈地、衷心地拥护国务院命令。他说：西藏和平解放八年来，在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的民族政策的光辉照耀下，西藏人民得到了幸福的生活和宗教信仰自由的权利。他对此表示诚恳感谢。
    发言者一致谴责原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团背叛祖国和西藏人民的罪恶活动，拥护国务院的命令，欢庆西藏人民的新生。他们表示要在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹备委员会的直接领导下，团结一致，共同努力，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。
    会议一致通过关于贯彻执行国务院
      3月28日的命令等五项决议
    会议在分组讨论上述报告和各项议案后，一致通过了“西藏自治区筹备委员会关于贯彻执行国务院3月28日的命令的决议”、“关于健全和加强西藏自治区筹备委员会各部门组织机构的决议”、“关于增补西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员会委员的决议”、“关于撤销赤江·罗桑意西全国人民代表大会代表资格和推选帕巴拉·卓列朗杰为全国人民代表大会代表的决议”、“关于撤销土登泽仁（多娃堪苏）西藏自治区筹备委员会委员和增补丁甲·多吉坚赞、泽仁旺堆为本委委员的决议”。每一项决议都在热烈的掌声中全体通过。
    今天的会议上始终充满着团结、合作的气氛。大家对继续平定残余的叛乱分子和西藏今后的光明前景都充满了信心。
