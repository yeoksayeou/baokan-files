Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: According to a report by the Indian Press Trust: Indian Prime Minister Nehru admitted on the afternoon of the 24th, after meeting with the Dalai Lama, that the three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan were genuine. Nehru said at a press conference held in Mussoorie after a four-hour conversation with the Dalai Lama that the Dalai Lama had told him that he had written several letters to the Chinese military commander in Tibet.

Prior to this, Nehru had twice publicly stated in the Indian People's House and at press conferences that he doubted the authenticity of these letters from the Dalai Lama. He said in the People's House on March 30th that "these letters are quite surprising" and questioned "whether these letters were really written." He also said at a press conference on April 5th, "Saying that the Dalai Lama was forced to do something, saying that the Dalai Lama was in fact complaining about the people who very much respected him, this seems to me to be a very strange statement."

Nehru said, "I didn't ask him this question. It was mentioned by (the Dalai Lama) when raising an issue."

A reporter asked Nehru what the Dalai Lama had said. Nehru said, "Since you asked me, I can answer. He admitted that he wrote the letters to them for two reasons. But the main reason was—I think, I guess, I didn't ask him—that his situation was very difficult at the time. On the one hand, he couldn't avoid breaking with the Chinese, and he hoped there might be some way, some solution could be found, so he was very disturbed and conflicted."

The reporter asked again what kind of conflict it was, whether there was a split in the Tibetan cabinet. Nehru replied, "What I am thinking about is not a split there, what I am thinking about is that on the one hand, he hoped to avoid conflict with the Chinese, and on the other hand, his Tibetan sentiments pulled him in another direction. This inner conflict existed."

Nehru said that until 4:00 PM on March 17th, the Dalai Lama did not have a clear idea of leaving Lhasa.

Regarding the Dalai Lama's departure from Lhasa, Nehru gave a narration in his conversation. Nehru said, "Until 4:00 PM on March 17th, they (the Dalai Lama and his entourage - Indian Press Trust note) did not have a clear idea of leaving Lhasa. They left six hours later, at 10:00 PM." As for why this group of people left, Nehru said, "When the statement (note: referring to the so-called Dalai Lama's statement on April 18th) said that those 'shells or something fell on his palace'—whatever the reason—this had a strong influence on their thinking. Since everything was over, 'let's go,' so they left within six hours." He also said, "In fact, they didn't bring many clothes."

Nehru said that the Dalai Lama had said two or three years ago that he hoped to implement reforms in Tibet, and he said so today as well.

A reporter asked if the Dalai Lama hoped to implement reforms in Tibet. Nehru said, "When the Dalai Lama came here two or three years ago, he told me that he hoped to implement reforms in Tibet. He told me that Tibet is an advanced country in the spiritual aspect, but in the social and economic aspects, it is a backward country. He said this to me in the past, and he said so today as well."

A reporter asked Nehru whether he had told the Dalai Lama about his earlier suggestion at a press conference to invite the Panchen Lama to meet with the Dalai Lama. Nehru said, "I'm very sorry, I forgot to tell him about this." The Prime Minister added, "I originally intended to tell him, but I completely forgot." This statement caused laughter among the reporters.

Regarding the meeting itself, Nehru said, "It was a fairly good meeting, I hope it was a beneficial meeting."

A reporter asked if he had discussed solutions to the Tibetan issue with the Dalai Lama. Nehru said that a solution could not be found "immediately." "We discussed the possibility of creating an atmosphere that might help pave the way for a solution."

A reporter asked if he had arranged another meeting with the Dalai Lama. Nehru said, "We have not arranged another meeting, but we will probably meet again sometime later."

At a reception held for Nehru in Mussoorie that day, he said that someone asked him whether he would still adhere to the "Panchsheel" (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) after all these events in Tibet. Nehru said, "We cannot turn a deaf ear to everything we say to others, but despite this, we know that Panchsheel is good."

Nehru believes that Panchen's speech is unfair to India, or China, or Tibet, or Panchen himself.

Xinhua News Agency, April 25th, Mussoorie dispatch from Indian Press Trust: Before arriving in Mussoorie to meet with the Dalai Lama, who was being held hostage by rebels, Indian Prime Minister Nehru expressed disagreement at a press conference on the 24th with the Chinese side's accusations of Indian expansionists.

A reporter asked him, "Is there any reason or basis for the Chinese side's accusations of so-called Indian expansionists?" Nehru replied, "No, I cannot answer this question now. Obviously, I disagree with this statement. I found from reports from Beijing that they are deeply influenced by the past history of Tibet. There is no doubt that the British government at that time did act that way in Tibet."

In the conversation, Nehru believed that Panchen Erdeni's remarks about the Dalai Lama in his speech at the National People's Congress meeting on the 22nd were "unfair to India, or China, or Tibet, or the Panchen Lama himself." He said that the Panchen Lama's words were spoken "in a very agitated state."

Nehru said that he welcomes the Panchen Lama to come to India to meet with the Dalai Lama or anyone else. He said that the Chinese ambassador or any Chinese special envoy can meet with the Dalai Lama.

Nehru expressed his hope to create conditions for the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet.

Nehru expressed his hope to create conditions for the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet. He said that this issue and other issues should not become a matter of heated debate and controversy, and must be considered calmly to avoid the deterioration of the situation.

Nehru said that he came to Mussoorie to fulfill an old appointment, not realizing "I must meet an important traveler." He said, "If I didn't already have this appointment (to give a speech at a travel agency conference), I wouldn't have rushed to meet him."

A reporter asked him at the time whether there was a contradiction between the Dalai Lama saying that he was not being held hostage and the fact that he was surrounded by barbed wire, sentries, and guards. Nehru said, "You are confusing two things together. The situation is clearly not like that. He came here of his own free will. For security and other purposes, we had to make some arrangements. This is a very different matter. I don't know how the situation will develop, whether a large group of people with him will continue to stay with him. But I might as well say this: If any special envoy wants to see him, the Dalai Lama can meet him."

He said that the Dalai Lama needed to rest after a long journey and get rid of constant worries. He said that the Dalai Lama's "main concern, after all, is the situation in Tibet, a peaceful solution, not giving talks to reporters." He added that the Indian government hopes "not to gag the Dalai Lama." But, at the same time, "we do expect him to consider the difficulties of the situation and speak or act with a proper attitude."

Nehru said once again in the conversation that "India's concern for Tibet is historical, emotional, and religious, but basically not political." He believes that "a peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue" will not be quick. A reporter asked him whether he felt optimistic about a peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue, given the official and unofficial comments from Beijing. Nehru said, "Of course, no matter how long this may take—perhaps not soon—people always want to do it this way."

Nehru said that there was no question of issuing any joint or separate statements after his meeting with the Dalai Lama. He said, "Whatever statements are issued will be issued through normal channels."

It is reported that Nehru held a four-hour meeting with the Dalai Lama after holding a press conference.

Nehru said that people have the right to express sympathy on the Tibetan issue. Everyone should exercise wisdom and restraint.

Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: According to the Indian Information Bureau, Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke to local Congress Party workers in Mussoorie before meeting with the Dalai Lama on the 24th. He said that the Tibetan issue is a complex issue that will cause great concern because it involves some countries.

Nehru told these Congress Party members that emotions and feelings would be stirred up in such a matter. However, they cannot allow themselves to be completely dominated by emotions; they must consider it calmly and carefully.

He also said that some other countries that have relations with India are also concerned about the Tibetan issue. Therefore, everyone should exercise wisdom and restraint and be responsible when saying anything on this issue. People have the right to express sympathy on the Tibetan issue. But it is not very responsible to express opinions on some complex issues without understanding all the facts.

Nehru asked the residents of Mussoorie not to do anything that might disturb the Dalai Lama, not to surround his residence and disturb his thoughts. He said that they must remember that the Dalai Lama had gone through a long journey under very distressing circumstances. Therefore, it is very appropriate to give the Dalai Lama the opportunity to discuss the tortuous situation in Tibet with his colleagues in a peaceful atmosphere and to get rid of mental overwork.

    尼赫鲁说，达赖喇嘛告诉他给谭冠三将军几封信是真的
    尼赫鲁还表示：和平共处五项原则仍然是好的
    新华社25日讯　据印度报业托辣斯报道：印度总理尼赫鲁24日下午在会见达赖喇嘛以后承认，达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信是真的。尼赫鲁在穆索里同达赖喇嘛举行了长达四小时的谈话以后举行的记者招待会上说达赖喇嘛告诉他，他曾经给西藏的中国军事司令写了几封信。
  　在这以前，尼赫鲁曾经在印度人民院和记者招待会上两次公开表示，他怀疑达赖喇嘛的这些信件是真的。他在3月30日在人民院中说过，“这些信是颇为令人惊讶的”，“是不是真的写了这些信”。他在4月5日又曾在记者招待会上说过，“说达赖喇嘛被迫做某种事情的，说达赖喇嘛事实上在抱怨他自己的非常崇敬他的人，这在我看来是一种很奇怪的说法。”
    尼赫鲁说，“我没有问他这个问题。这是在提到一个问题的时候（达赖喇嘛）说到的。”
    有记者问尼赫鲁，达赖喇嘛说了什么，尼赫鲁说：“既然你问我，我可以回答。他承认由于两个原因，他给他们写了信。但是主要的原因是——我想，我猜，我没有问他——当时他的处境非常困难。一方面，他没法避免同中国人决裂，并且希望可以有某种办法，可以得到某种解决，因此他的心情非常烦乱和矛盾。”
    记者又问，什么样的矛盾，西藏内阁是不是发生了分裂，尼赫鲁回答说：“我所想的不是那里的分裂，我所想的是，一方面他希望避免同中国人发生冲突，另一方面他的西藏感情把他朝另外一个方向拉。这种内心矛盾是存在的。”
    尼赫鲁说，到三月十七日下午四点钟止，达赖还没有离开拉萨的明确想法。
    关于达赖喇嘛离开拉萨一事，尼赫鲁在他的谈话中作了一番叙述，尼赫鲁说，“到3月17日下午四点钟为止，他们（达赖喇嘛一行——印度报业托辣斯注）还没有离开拉萨的明确想法。他们是在六小时以后，即晚上十点钟离开的。”至于这批人为什么要离开，尼赫鲁说，“当据声明（按：指4月18日的所谓达赖喇嘛的声明）说，那些‘炮弹或者什么东西落在他的宫殿上’——不管是什么原因——的时候，这就对他们的想法产生了强烈的影响。既然一切都完了，‘我们走吧’，于是他们就在六小时以内离开了。”他又说：“事实上，他们没有带多少衣服。”
    尼赫鲁说，达赖在两三年前曾说，他希望在西藏实行改革，今天他也这样说了。
    有记者问，达赖喇嘛是否希望在西藏实行改革，尼赫鲁说，“当达赖喇嘛两三年前到这里来的时候，他曾对我说，他希望在西藏实行改革。他告诉我，西藏在精神方面是一个先进的国家，但是在社会方面和经济方面，它是一个落后的国家。他过去对我这样说，今天也这样说了。”
    有记者问尼赫鲁是否把他早些时候在记者招待会上谈到邀请班禅喇嘛来会见达赖喇嘛的建议告诉达赖喇嘛，尼赫鲁说，“真是抱歉，我忘了把这件事告诉他。”这位总理又说，“我本来打算告诉他，但是我完全忘记了。”他这种说法在记者们中引起了哄堂大笑。
    关于会谈本身，尼赫鲁说，“这是一次相当好的会谈，我希望这是一次有益的会谈。”
    有记者问，他是不是同达赖喇嘛讨论了解决西藏问题的办法，尼赫鲁说，不能“马上”找到解决办法。“我们讨论了创造一种可能有助于为解决办法铺平道路的气氛的可能性。”
    有记者问，他曾否安排同达赖喇嘛再作一次会谈，尼赫鲁说，“我们没有安排另外一次会谈，但是过些时候我们大概会再会晤。”
    当天在穆索里为尼赫鲁举行的一次招待会上，他说，有人问他，在西藏发生了这一切事情后，他是否仍要坚持“潘查希拉”（和平共处五项原则），尼赫鲁说，“我们对别人说我们的一切话不能充耳不闻，但是尽管这样，我们知道，潘查希拉是好的”。
    尼赫鲁认为班禅的讲话对印度或者中国或者西藏或者班禅自己，是不公正的。
    新华社25日讯　据印度报业托辣斯穆索里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁24日到达穆索里同叛乱分子劫持下的达赖喇嘛会面以前，在记者招待会上表示不同意中国方面对于印度扩张主义分子的指责。
    新闻记者问他，“中国方面对所谓印度扩张主义分子的指责是否有任何理由或根据”。尼赫鲁回答说，“不，我现在不能回答这个问题。显然，我不同意这种说法。我从来自北京的报道中发现，他们深受西藏过去的历史的影响。毫无疑问，那时的英国政府在西藏的确是那样行事的。”
    尼赫鲁在谈话中认为班禅额尔德尼22日在我全国人民代表大会会议上的发言中关于达赖喇嘛的话，“对印度或者中国或者西藏或者班禅喇嘛自己，是不公正的”。他说班禅喇嘛的话是“在非常激动的情况下”讲出来的。
    尼赫鲁说，他欢迎班禅喇嘛到印度来同达赖喇嘛或者其他任何人见面。他说中国大使或者任何中国特使都可以会见达赖喇嘛。
    尼赫鲁表示希望能为达赖回到西藏创造条件。
    尼赫鲁表示希望能为达赖喇嘛回到西藏创造条件。他说，这个问题以及其他问题不应该成为激烈的论战和辩论的问题，而且必须冷静地加以考虑，以免局势恶化。
    尼赫鲁说，他到穆索里来是为了履行一次老的约会，而不是意识到“我必须会见一位重要的旅客”。他说，“要是我原来没有这个约会（在旅行社的一次会议上发表演说），我是不会赶来会见他的。”
    当时有记者问他，达赖喇嘛说他没有被劫持，而他是处于铁丝网、哨兵和卫兵的包围之下，这两点是不是有矛盾。尼赫鲁说，“你把两件事情混淆在一起了。情况显然不是这样的。他是按照自己的意愿到这里来的。为了安全和其他目的，我们不得不作某些安排。这是十分不同的事。我不知道局势会怎样发展，跟他在一起的一大批人是否会继续跟他在一起。可是我不妨这样说：如果有任何特使要来见他，达赖喇嘛尽可以会见他。”
    他说，达赖喇嘛在长途跋涉之后需要休息和摆脱经常的烦恼，他说达赖喇嘛“主要关心的毕竟是西藏的情况、和平解决的办法，而不是向记者发表谈话”。他又说，印度政府希望“不封住达赖喇嘛的口”。但是，同时，“我们的确期望他会考虑到局势的困难，以相当的态度讲话或行事”。
    尼赫鲁在谈话中又一次说，“印度对西藏的关心是历史方面的、感情方面的和宗教方面的，而基本上不是政治方面的。”他认为，“和平解决西藏问题”不会很快。有记者问他，鉴于北京官方和非官方的评论，他是否对和平解决西藏问题感到乐观。尼赫鲁说，“当然，不管这可能需要多久——也许不会很快——人们总想做到这样。”
    尼赫鲁说根本不存在他同达赖喇嘛会谈之后发表任何联合的或单独的声明的问题，他说，“不管发表什么声明，都将通过正常的途径发表”。
    据报道，尼赫鲁在举行记者招待会以后同达赖喇嘛进行了长达四小时的会谈。
    尼赫鲁说，人们有权在西藏问题上表示同情。所有的人都应该运用智慧和自制。
    新华社25日讯　据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁24日在穆索里同达赖喇嘛会见以前，曾向当地的国大党工作人员讲话。他说，西藏问题是一个复杂的问题，它会引起很大的忧虑，因为它牵涉到一些国家。
    尼赫鲁告诉这些国大党人说，在这样的一件事情上是会动起感情和情绪的。可是，他们不能让自己完全被感情所支配；他们必须冷静地细细考虑。
    他又说，同印度有关系的其他一些国家也关心西藏问题，因此，所有的人都应该运用智慧和自制，在这个问题上说什么话的时候要有责任感。人们有权在西藏问题上表示同情。可是在还不了解全部事实的时候就对一些复杂的问题表示意见，是不太负责的做法。　尼赫鲁要求穆索里的居民不要做任何可能会打扰达赖喇嘛的事情，不要围在他的住处周围，打扰他的思路。他说，他们必须记住，达赖喇嘛在他很痛心的情况下经过了长途跋涉。因此，让达赖喇嘛有机会在和平气氛中同他的同僚们讨论西藏的曲折局势，摆脱精神上的过劳，是非常应当的。
