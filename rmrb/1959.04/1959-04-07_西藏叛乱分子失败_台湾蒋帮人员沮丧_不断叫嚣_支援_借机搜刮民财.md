Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch from Taipei: Following the failure of the armed rebellion by Tibetan rebels, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is anxiously clamoring for "active measures" to provide "support" to the Tibetan rebels. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Executive Yuan," "Legislative Yuan," "Control Yuan," etc., have recently held multiple meetings to discuss ways to "support the anti-communist forces in Tibet." However, according to foreign news agencies, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has been unable to come up with any effective way to salvage the failure of the Tibetan rebels during these lengthy meetings. Currently, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is using the pretext of "supporting Tibet" to fleece the people of Taiwan and overseas Chinese in the Philippines, Thailand, and other places. On April 3rd, the Chiang gang published a so-called "Letter to Compatriots at Home and Abroad," clamoring that within these two months, Taiwan "must ensure that everyone empties their pockets and donates."

The rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion has left the Chiang gang very despondent. The Chiang gang's "ambassador" to the United States, Yeh Kung-chao, complained that the imperialists had not provided sufficient support to the Tibetan rebels, lamenting that the "free world" "stood idly by without taking any action" regarding the People's Liberation Army's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, "which is truly lamentable." An editorial in the Chiang gang's official newspaper, the "Central Daily News," repeatedly urged the Chiang gang members to "correct their views on the Tibetan anti-communist struggle," urging them not to pay attention to "the gains and losses of a single city or place" and "must not be affected by the good or bad news of temporary military events."

    西藏叛乱分子失败
    台湾蒋帮人员沮丧
    不断叫嚣“支援”　借机搜刮民财
    新华社6日讯　台北消息：西藏叛乱分子的武装叛乱失败后，蒋介石集团焦急地不断叫嚣要“积极行动”，给予西藏叛乱分子“支援”。蒋介石集团的“行政院”、“立法院”、“监察院”等，最近曾分别举行了多次会议，讨论所谓“支援西藏反共力量”的办法。但是据外国通讯社说，蒋介石集团在这些历时很长的会议上，都想不出什么挽救西藏叛乱分子失败的有效办法来。目前蒋介石集团正在用所谓“支援西藏”的名义，向台湾人民和菲律宾、泰国等地的华侨搜刮钱财。蒋帮在4月3日发表了一篇所谓“告海内外同胞书”，叫喊在这两个月内，台湾“要做到人人倾囊、个个捐输”。
    西藏叛乱的被迅速平息，使得蒋帮人员十分沮丧。蒋帮驻美“大使”叶公超抱怨帝国主义对西藏叛乱分子支持不力，他哀叹说：“自由世界”对于人民解放军平定西藏叛乱“竟然袖手旁观，而毫无作为，诚属可悲”。蒋帮机关报“中央日报”的社论则一再要蒋帮人员“纠正对于西藏反共斗争的看法”，要他们不必注意“一城一地的得失”和“决不可为一时军事消息的好坏所影响”。
