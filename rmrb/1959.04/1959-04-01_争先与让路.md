Striving for the Lead and Yielding the Way

Striving for the Lead and Yielding the Way are a Unity of Opposites

The central issue of the entire nation acting as a single chessboard is ensuring the key points. To ensure the key points, we must distinguish between the important and the less important, the urgent and the less urgent. Some secondary production and construction projects that are not immediately needed should be postponed and temporarily yield the way. This is a matter of course. However, some people have raised the question: “Aren't you advocating exerting full effort and striving for the upstream? How can you strive for the upstream while also stopping and yielding the way? Isn't this self-contradictory?” Indeed, in the view of these comrades, it seems that striving for the lead precludes yielding the way, and yielding the way makes it impossible to strive for the lead. The two are seen as diametrically opposed and irreconcilable.

But this is not the case. In the view of dialectical materialists, striving for the lead and yielding the way are indeed two opposing aspects that contradict each other, but they also possess a unity. That is to say, they contradict and struggle with each other, but they are also interconnected and dependent on each other. The reason they are contradictory is that to ensure the priority development of key production and construction projects, some secondary or unimportant aspects have to wait and yield the way, which relatively slows down the progress of the latter. The reason they are unified is that striving for the lead is to enable our entire construction undertaking to "scale new heights," and the purpose of yielding the way is precisely to provide a "ladder" for the more rapid development of our entire construction undertaking. Their fundamental interests are consistent. The connection and dependence between the two are manifested in the fact that each takes its opposing aspect as the premise for its own existence. Without yielding the way as a condition, it would be impossible for key production and construction projects to achieve leaps and bounds. Conversely, without the priority development of key production and construction projects, those secondary aspects that temporarily yield the way would not have a solid and reliable material foundation for further development in the future. Thus, it can be seen that striving for the lead and yielding the way are two opposing aspects of a unified whole. It is precisely because of this unity and struggle of opposites that our various construction undertakings are developing rapidly and changing with each passing day.

Who Should Go First, Who Should Yield the Way

No matter what we do, there must be a sequence, importance, and urgency. We must not act indiscriminately, grabbing everything at once. If we do that, we will often "treat chicken feathers as imperial decrees" or even "grasp at sesame seeds and lose watermelons," and end up accomplishing nothing. However, who should go first, who should go last, who is the key point, who is the minor point, who should be urgent, who should be slow, are not determined by any one person's subjective will, but by objective reality. The problem is that the subjective must correctly reflect the objective. Who should go first, and who should yield the way? Chairman Mao told us in his article "On Contradiction": "In the process of development of a complex thing, there are many contradictions, one of which is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions." It can be seen that this principal contradiction that "determines or influences the existence and development of other contradictions" is what we call the key point, and therefore must be given priority and resolved as soon as possible; while those "other contradictions" must be placed behind and temporarily wait and yield the way. The key points of our economic construction are those production and construction projects that play a major role in ensuring the high-speed and proportionate development of the national economy and are urgently needed for developing production and improving people's lives. They are the main attack direction in the overall Great Leap Forward, and they are the leading links that determine the victory or defeat of the entire "battle." Therefore, we must ensure that they are the first to "get on the horse" and move forward rapidly. Those secondary production and construction projects, or those that are not urgently needed at present, should wait and yield the way. For example, in the current situation of insufficient materials, areas with poorer construction conditions should yield the way to areas with better conditions; projects that cannot play a role temporarily should yield the way to projects that can play a role immediately; projects that are not urgently needed by the state should yield the way to projects that are urgently needed by the state; enterprises with lower production efficiency, higher costs, and poorer product quality should yield the way to enterprises with higher production efficiency, lower costs, and better quality, and so on. Only by distinguishing between the primary and secondary, giving priority to what should be prioritized, and placing behind what should be placed behind, cooperating with each other, and supporting each other, can we ensure that our construction undertakings develop at a high speed.

Of course, what we call important and less important, primary and secondary, urgent and slow, are only relative under certain specific conditions, and their positions are not permanently fixed, because dialectics tells us that: a contradictory thing not only coexists in a unity under certain conditions, but also transforms into each other under certain conditions. That is to say, under certain conditions, the less important can also be transformed into the important, the secondary can also be transformed into the primary, and the slow can also be transformed into the urgent. For example, take the contradiction between the development of raw material industries and processing industries. The outstanding contradiction in our current construction is the shortage of raw materials, so the raw material industry must be listed as a priority and given priority development. However, after efforts, once the raw material industry has achieved a high degree of development, and the contradiction of insufficient raw material supply has been basically resolved, then, according to the specific situation at that time, the processing industry may be listed as a priority. We have different central tasks at different periods, and we must grasp different "key links" at different periods. Therefore, we must proceed from reality, giving priority to what should be less important and giving priority to what should be more important. We must never regard the current key points as minor points, nor can we regard things that will only become key points in the future as today's key points.

Striving for the Lead Must Be Based on Guaranteeing Overall Victory

Indeed, the Party's General Line is like a key that has opened the treasure house of the subjective initiative of China's 600 million people. The intelligence and talent of the people are like a spring, gushing forth. Their bold slogan is "Compare with the advanced in everything, strive for first place in everything." This spirit of the people to strive for the upstream will surely be continuously promoted and developed.

But there are two kinds of striving for the lead. One is starting from the overall situation, overcoming difficulties in every possible way to realize the unified plan of the country, creating conditions, exerting full effort, striving for the upstream, and striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the socialist construction undertaking. This is communist striving for the lead; the other is striving for the lead that only considers the local and not the overall, only considers the interests of its own small circle and not the interests of the country. This is departmentalism's striving for the lead. Naturally, we advocate the former and oppose the latter.

Some comrades say: "Our economy in all aspects is still very backward. Why can't we engage in large-scale construction in all aspects and do more construction?" It is undeniable that the good wishes of these comrades to speed up construction are very valuable. But we say that socialist construction cannot rely solely on subjective wishes, but must combine subjective wishes with objective possibilities, and combine revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific analysis. These comrades have forgotten that our country's foundation is still very weak, so we must first concentrate our limited manpower, material resources, and financial resources on the most urgently needed, most effective, and most important aspects. We must never "divide our forces and use them sparingly, fighting a war of attrition." If we do not distinguish between primary and secondary, and advance on all fronts, with all undertakings flourishing, we will not only fail to truly speed up the pace of construction, but will also delay the pace of development of construction. Although there is a good wish, the result will inevitably be contrary to our wishes, and haste makes waste. We must never adopt this approach.

Individual comrades lack an overall perspective. When considering problems, they often consider the interests of their own unit too much, placing their local interests above the interests of the country. They drill into small circles, blinded by a leaf, excessively emphasizing the uniqueness of their department. Therefore, they try their best to fight for more projects in capital construction; in the case of insufficient materials, they try every means to fight for a little more, even "laying ambushes" and making false reports; when they cannot get in line, they force their way in, even thinking that it doesn't matter if they squeeze out others, as long as they can protect themselves. In their view, no matter what happens to the overall situation, as long as they do more, this is "striving for the upstream." In fact, these comrades are greatly mistaken. It must be recognized that the "striving for the upstream" we are talking about is based on striving for an overall Great Leap Forward in socialist construction across the country. To measure whether each locality is striving for the upstream, we must see how much contribution it has made to striving for the overall Great Leap Forward in socialist construction across the country, and what role it has played in the victory of the overall situation. This kind of striving for the lead that only benefits small interests while harming the overall situation can only be a manifestation of departmentalism.

The reason these comrades are wrong is that they have not correctly understood the dialectical relationship between the local and the overall. Perhaps some people will say: "The overall is composed of the local, and I am also for the interests of the people in my region!" True, some people are indeed "good-hearted," but in order to protect the interests of their own unit, they violate the interests of the whole, and thus fundamentally violate the interests of the people in their region. The relationship between the local and the overall is like playing chess. A brilliant chess player always has a long-term vision and proceeds from the overall situation, taking care of the overall situation with every step. A poor chess player, on the other hand, lacks an overall perspective, has a narrow view, only sees the local, and does not see the overall, resulting in being passive everywhere and losing the entire game. So it is with playing chess, and so it is with construction. Chairman Mao once taught us: "Disregarding the overall situation, being indifferent to other departments, other places, and other people, is the characteristic of these departmentalists. For such people, we must strengthen education so that they understand that this is a tendency towards sectarianism. If it develops, it is very dangerous." ("On Correcting Unhealthy Tendencies in Party Style")

Thus, it can be seen that striving for the lead must be based on guaranteeing the victory of the overall situation, and striving for the lead that deviates from this premise must be opposed.

Yielding the Way is for the High-Speed Development of the National Economy

As mentioned earlier, in order to ensure the development of key construction projects, it is necessary for some secondary aspects to temporarily yield the way. But some people criticize us and say: "Your advocacy of yielding the way is not in line with the spirit of striving for the upstream." We say: No, this is precisely for speeding up the pace of construction, for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

The reason why these comrades understand yielding the way as a passive retreat is precisely because they do not look at problems from the perspective of the interconnectedness of things, but separate the local from the overall, only see the small picture, not the big picture, only see the phenomenon, not the essence, only see the trees, not the forest, and thus draw wrong conclusions. In fact, yielding the way is by no means a passive measure, but an active measure for faster progress. Now let us give a few examples from the war that everyone knows to illustrate this point. In the revolutionary war, we often encounter such things: defending in order to attack, retreating in order to advance, moving to the side in order to move to the front, taking a detour in order to take a straight path, and so on. Can we say that these "defense," "retreat," "side," and "detour" are passive retreats, rather than being for the purpose of more quickly eliminating the enemy?

Of course, the temporary yielding of the way in some secondary aspects does temporarily reduce the speed from a local perspective, but the result of yielding the way preserves the overall situation and brings about higher speed, and also opens up broad avenues for greater leaps forward in some of the production and construction projects that temporarily yield the way in the future. Isn't this clear enough? Chairman Mao said in "Strategic Problems in China's Revolutionary War": "...If what we lose is land, and what we gain is victory over the enemy, plus recovering the land, plus expanding the land, this is a profitable business. In market transactions, buyers cannot obtain goods without losing money; sellers cannot obtain money without losing goods. The loss caused by the revolutionary movement is destruction, and the gain is progressive construction. Sleep and rest lose time, but gain the energy for tomorrow's work. If there is any fool who does not know this, refuses to sleep, he will have no energy tomorrow, and this is a losing business." It is most appropriate to use these vivid examples listed by Chairman Mao to illustrate the dialectical relationship between yielding the way and better progress. An old Chinese saying goes, "People have things they do not do, and then they can have things they do." This means that "not doing" is for the sake of "doing," and is for the sake of "doing" better. Moreover, the production and construction projects we are talking about yielding the way are not completely not being done, but only slightly delayed in time? Therefore, we must clarify this point of view and consciously and actively yield the way in some places where it is necessary to yield the way.

    争先与让路
    孙景协
    争先与让路是对立的统一
    全国一盘棋的中心问题是保证重点。为了保证重点，就必须分别轻重缓急，某些次要的或暂时不迫切需要的生产建设事业就要推迟一下，暂时让一下路。这是理所当然的事。然而有人却向我们提出这样的问题：“你们不是提倡鼓足干劲，力争上游吗？既要力争上游，又让停车让路，这不自相矛盾？”的确，在这些同志看来，似乎要争先就不能让路，要让路就无法争先，二者是针锋相对、无法统一的。
    其实不然。在辩证唯物主义者看来，争先与让路固然是相互矛盾着的两个对立面，但是它们又具有着统一性。也就是说，它们既相互矛盾着、斗争着，但是又相互联结着、依赖着。其所以说是矛盾着，因为要保证重点生产建设事业的优先发展，某些次要的或不重要的方面就不得不暂时等待一下，让一下路，这对后者说来，的确是相对地放慢了一下前进的步伐。其所以说是统一的，因为争先是为了使我们的整个建设事业“更上一层楼”，而让路的目的也正是给我们整个建设事业更迅速的发展让出前进的“阶梯”，它们的根本利益是一致的。而这二者之间的联系性、依赖性则表现在：它们各以和它对立着的方面为自己存在的前提，没有让路为条件，要使重点生产建设事业获得“一日千里”的飞跃发展就不可能；反过来讲，没有重点生产建设事业的优先发展，那些暂时让路的次要方面今后要获得进一步的发展，就没有坚实可靠的物质基础。由此可见，争先与让路是统一性的两个对立面。正是由于这种对立面的统一和斗争，才推动着我们的各项建设事业日新月异地向前发展。
    谁该在先，谁该让路
    不论办什么事情，总得有个先后、轻重、缓急，决不能不分青红皂白，眉毛胡子一把抓。如果那样的话，就往往会“拿着鸡毛当令箭”，甚至“抓了芝麻，漏了西瓜”，结果什么事情也办不好。然而谁该在先，谁该在后，谁是重点，谁是轻点，谁该是急，谁该是缓，决不是凭哪一个人的主观意志决定的，而是由客观实际决定的。问题在于主观要正确地反映客观。究竟谁应该在先，谁应该让路呢？毛主席在“矛盾论”一文中曾这样告诉我们：“在复杂的事物的发展过程中，有许多的矛盾存在，其中必有一种是主要的矛盾，由于它的存在和发展，规定或影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展。”可见，这种“规定或影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展”的主要矛盾，就是我们所说的重点，因此必须在先，尽先予以解决；而那些“其他矛盾”则必须在后，暂时等待一下，让一下路。我们经济建设中的重点，就是那些对保证国民经济高速度按比例发展具有重大作用、而又是发展生产和改善人民生活所迫切需要的生产建设事业。它们是全面大跃进中的主攻方面，是决定着整个“战役”胜负的主导环节，因此必须保证它们首先“上马”，迅速前进。而那些次要的或当前不迫切需要的生产建设事业，就应该等待一下，让一下路。比如说：在当前物资不足的情况下，建设条件比较差的地区，要让路给条件比较好的地区；暂时不能发挥作用的工程，要让路给能马上发挥作用的工程；国家暂时不迫切需要的工程，要让路给国家迫切需要的工程；生产效率比较低、成本比较高、产品质量比较差的企业，要让路给生产效率比较高、成本比较低、质量比较好的企业，等等。只有分清主次，该先则先，该后则后，互相协作，互相支援，才能保证我们的建设事业高速度地向前发展。
    当然，我们所说的重与轻、主与次、急与缓，这只是在某种特定条件下相对而言，它们之间的位置并不是永久不变的，因为辩证法告诉我们：一种矛盾着的东西，不仅在一定条件下共处于一个统一体中，而且在一定条件下互相转化。这就是说，在一定条件下轻也会转化为重，次也会转化为主，缓也会转化为急。例如拿发展原材料工业和加工工业之间的矛盾来说。当前我们建设中的突出矛盾是原材料不足，因此原材料工业必须列为重点，优先予以发展。但是经过努力后，一当原材料工业有了高度的发展，原材料供应不足这一矛盾已基本解决时，那么根据当时的具体情况，加工工业可能被列为重点。我们在不同时期有不同的中心工作，在不同的时期要抓不同的“纲”。因此，我们必须从实际出发，该轻则轻，该重则重，决不能把目前的重点当作轻点，也不能把将来才能成为重点的东西看成今天的重点。
    争先必须以保证全局胜利为前提
    的确，党的总路线像一把钥匙，打开了我国六亿人民主观能动性的宝库，人民群众的聪明才智犹如泉涌，滔滔而出。他们的豪迈口号是“事事比先进，人人争第一”。人民群众的这种力争上游的气魄，必将不断发扬光大。
    但是有两种争先，一种是从全局出发，为了实现国家统一的计划，千方百计克服困难，创造条件，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为争取社会主义建设事业更大更好更全面跃进的争先。这是共产主义的争先；另一种是只顾局部而不顾整体，只顾自己小圈圈的利益而不顾国家利益的争先，这是本位主义的争先。自然我们是提倡前者，反对后者。
    有的同志说：“我们各方面的经济还很落后，为什么不可以在各个方面都大兴土木，多搞一些建设呢？”不可否认，这些同志加快建设速度的良好愿望是十分可贵的。但是我们说，社会主义建设不能单凭主观愿望，必须把主观愿望和客观可能性结合起来，把革命热情和科学分析结合起来。这些同志忘记了我们国家底子还很薄，因此必须把有限的人力、物力和财力首先集中使用在最迫切需要的、收效最快的、作用最大的方面去，决不能“分兵把口，分散使用兵力，打消耗战”。如果我们不分主次，齐头并进，百废俱兴，不仅不能真正加快建设事业的速度，而且还会延缓建设事业发展的速度。虽有一个良好的愿望，其结果必然是事与愿违，欲速则不达。我们万万不能采用这种办法。
    个别的同志缺乏全局观点，他们考虑问题常常过多地考虑本单位的利益，将自己局部的利益凌驾在国家之上，他们钻到小圈圈里，一叶障目，过分强调本部门的特殊，因而在基本建设中尽量多争项目；在物资不足的情况下千方百计想多争一点，甚至“打埋伏”、虚报；在排不上队的时候，硬往上挤，甚至认为挤掉别人不要紧，只要保全自己就行。在他们看来，不管全局怎样，只要自己多搞一些，这就是“力争上游”了。其实这些同志是大错特错了。必须认识，我们所说的“力争上游”，是以争取全国社会主义建设的全面大跃进为前提。衡量每一个局部是否力争上游，就要看他在争取全国社会主义全面大跃进中作出了多少贡献，对全局的胜利起了哪些作用。而这种只为小利而损大局的争先，只能是一种本位主义的表现。
    这些同志之所以错误，就是因为没有正确地认识局部和整体的辩证关系。也许有人会说：“整体是由局部构成的，我也是为了本地区人民群众的利益呀！”不错，的确有些人是“好心肠”，但是他们为了本单位的利益，却违背了整体的利益，从而也就在根本上违背了本地区人民群众的利益。这种局部和整体的关系正如下棋一样。高明的棋手，总是高瞻远瞩，每走一步都从全局出发，照顾全局。而蹩脚的棋手，则缺乏全局观点，目光如豆，只看到局部，看不到全局，结果处处被动，全盘皆输。下棋如此，搞建设也如此。毛主席曾教导我们说：“不顾大局，对别部、别地、别人漠不关心，就是这种本位主义者的特点。对于这样的人，必须加强教育，使他们懂得这就是一种宗派主义的倾向。如果发展下去，是很危险的。”（“整顿党的作风”）
    由此可见，争先必须以保证全局的胜利为前提，离开了这个前提的争先，是必须加以反对的。
    让路是为了高速度地发展国民经济
    前面已经说过，为了保证重点建设事业的发展，某些次要的方面暂时让一下路是必要的。但是有的人就指责我们说：“你们提倡让路，不符合力争上游的精神，”我们说：不，这正是为了加快建设速度，为了更大更好更全面地跃进。
    这些同志所以把让路理解为消极退却，正是因为他们不是从事物的联系性看问题，而是把局部和整体割裂开来，只见小局，不见大局，只看现象，不看本质，只见树木，不见森林，因而得出错误的结论。其实让路决不是消极的措施，而是为了更快前进的积极措施。现在让我们举出大家都知道的战争中的几个例子来说明这个问题。在革命战争中我们常碰到这样的事情：为了进攻而防御，为了前进而后退，为了向正面而向侧面，为了走直路而走弯路等等。难道我们能说这些“防御”、“后退”、“侧面”、“弯路”是消极退却，而不是为了更迅速地消灭敌人吗？
    当然，某些次要方面暂时的让路，从局部范围来讲暂时地确实是减低了一些速度，但是让路的结果却保全了大局，换来了更高的速度，而且也为暂时让路的某些生产建设事业今后更大的跃进开辟了广阔的道路。这难道还不清楚吗？毛主席在“中国革命战争的战略问题”一文中说：“……如果我们丧失的是土地，而取得的是战胜敌人，加恢复土地，再加扩大土地，这是赚钱生意。市场交易，买者如果不丧失金钱，就不能取得货物；卖者如果不丧失货物，也不能取得金钱。革命运动所造成的丧失是破坏，而其取得是进步的建设。睡眠和休息丧失了时间，却取得了明天工作的精力。如果有什么蠢人，不知此理，拒绝睡觉，他明天就没有精神了，这是蚀本生意。”用毛主席所列举的这些活生生的例子来说明让路与更好地前进之间的辩证关系，是再恰当不过的了。我国古语说“人有不为也，而后可以有为”。这就是说，“不为”是为了“为”，是为了“为”得更好。何况我们所说的让路的那些生产建设事业并不是根本不办，而只是在时间上稍微推迟一下呢？因此，我们必须弄清这个观点，在某些需要让路的地方自觉地、主动地让路。
