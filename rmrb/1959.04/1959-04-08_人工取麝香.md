    Artificial Musk Extraction
    Zhu Meiyu

    It is reported that the newly built Markang Musk Deer Farm in Sichuan Province has successfully transformed wild musk deer into domesticated musk deer, and has also achieved success in artificial musk extraction. The report describes the process of collecting musk: When extracting musk, it was discovered that the small opening on the outside of the male musk deer's musk sac would open and contract from time to time. When open, the small opening was about the size of a little finger, and musk granules could be seen inside the sac with the naked eye, with a strong fragrance emanating from the opening. Before the musk was extracted, the musk deer was very nervous; when the musk was extracted, the musk deer's neck was raised, and it appeared calm.

    Artificial musk extraction is a new thing. In the past, to extract musk, the musk deer had to be killed first.

    Musk is a special secretion of the male musk deer. This animal is produced in Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, Gansu and other provinces of China, and is commonly known as the musk deer. It looks very much like a deer, but it has no horns, so it belongs to another subfamily under the deer family. The musk deer is not large, with a small head, slightly rounded ears, a body length of about three feet, a height of about one and a half feet, and a weight of over a hundred pounds.

    In the umbilical region of the male musk deer, there is a sac for storing secretions. The shape of this sac is slightly protruding outside into an oval shape, and the inside is flat and round like a small bag. After the secretions inside dry and congeal, they look like powdered granules of dried blood, and some are moist and sticky, which is musk. From this point of view, musk is a modification of the skin glands and sweat glands of the musk deer, located between the skin and muscles, and is an aromatic substance used by male musk deer to attract female musk deer during the estrus period. Male musk deer begin to secrete this substance when they are three years old, and it increases year by year, and then decreases in old age. Secretion is strongest, the fragrance is strongest, and the yield is highest during the mating season. At this time, male musk deer often rub their abdomen on wood and stones, and the musk naturally falls out of the pellicle in the form of fragrant granules, which is what is called "residual fragrance" in ancient books, and it is also an important clue for hunters to track down musk deer. Since musk is a natural phenomenon secreted by musk deer, it is entirely possible to extract musk from the musk sac of live musk deer. Moreover, it will not affect the health and life of the musk deer. On the contrary, due to the success of artificial musk extraction, the method of killing musk deer for musk extraction can be avoided.

    Musk is one of China's famous specialties and is widely used in medicine and the perfumery industry. It is a precious fragrance in the modern world.

    Mastering this basic knowledge will allow us to carry out artificial domestication and artificial musk extraction, increasing musk production resources. Developing musk production requires little investment, little labor, and high returns. This is a new undertaking with great potential in China's animal husbandry.

    人工取麝香
    朱美予
    报载四川省新建起的马尔康獐鹿场，试验变野獐为家獐成功后，又获得人工取麝香的成功。在报道采取麝香的经过情形中说：取麝香时，发现公獐香囊外部的小孔，时张时缩，张开时，小孔约为小指头大，用肉眼就能看到囊内的香粒，并有浓郁的香气从孔内溢出。在取麝香前，獐很紧张；取麝香时，獐的颈部昂起，反表现得平静。
    人工取麝香这是一件新鲜的事。过去取麝香，都必须先把獐杀死。
    麝香是雄獐的特殊分泌物。这种动物，我国四川、青海、云南、甘肃等省都出产，俗名叫作香獐。形状很像鹿，但没有角，所以属于鹿科下面的另一个亚科。獐的身体不大，头部小，耳微圆，体长约三尺左右，高约一尺半，体重百多斤。
    在雄獐的脐部，有一个贮藏分泌物的囊。这个囊的形状外面稍稍突起成卵状，内部扁圆像个小袋子。里面的分泌物干结后，就好像干血凝成的粉粒，也有潮湿粘性的，这就是麝香。由此看来，麝香是獐的皮肤腺和汗腺的变形物，位在皮肤和肌肉之间，是雄獐发情期用以引诱雌獐的芳香物质。雄獐长到三岁时就开始分泌这种物质，其后逐年增加，老年时又减退。在交尾期分泌最旺，香气最浓，产量也最高。这时候，雄獐常常用腹部在木石上摩擦，麝香就离开皮膜而自然落出香粒，这便是古书中所称的“遗香”，也是猎人作为探寻獐的踪迹的重要线索。麝香既然是獐分泌的自然现象，所以从活獐的香囊中取麝香，是完全可以的。并且不会影响獐的健康和生命，相反地，由于人工取香成功，可以不用杀獐取香的办法了。
    麝香是我国著名特产之一，在医药、香料化工业方面的用途很广泛，是现代世界上名贵香料。
    掌握了这些基础知识，便可进行人工驯养和人工采取麝香，增加麝香的生产资源。发展麝香的生产，投资小，费工少，收益大，这是我国畜牧事业中大有可为的一项新的工作。
