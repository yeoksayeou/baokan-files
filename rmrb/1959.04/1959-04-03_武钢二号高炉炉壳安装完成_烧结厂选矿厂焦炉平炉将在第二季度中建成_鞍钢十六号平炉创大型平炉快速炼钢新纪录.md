Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 2nd: The shell installation project of Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 2 blast furnace was fully completed on March 31st. The shell hoisting project for the three hot blast stoves that supply air to No. 2 blast furnace was also completed on the same day.

　　The main body shell of No. 2 blast furnace weighs 491 tons. From the start of installation on March 19th to its completion on March 31st, it only took twelve days and four hours, completing the project ten days ahead of schedule. The shell installation project for the three hot blast stoves started on March 3rd. The original plan was to complete it in fifteen days, but it only took four days and nineteen hours. The construction speed of these four projects is not only unprecedented in China's history, but also exceeds the shell installation speed of the newly built Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 blast furnace.

　　Currently, the workers building No. 2 blast furnace are carrying out preparatory work and are about to start installing metal components such as downcomers, furnace top steel frames, inclined bridges, and bricklaying. They are determined to further adopt measures and strive to build No. 2 blast furnace in a hundred days of hard work.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 2nd: Wuhan Iron and Steel Company decided to "concentrate forces, focus on key targets," and ensure that in the second quarter, No. 2 blast furnace, sintering plant, ore dressing plant, No. 3 coking oven, No. 1 open hearth furnace, No. 2 open hearth furnace, and refractory materials plant will be successively completed and put into production. The construction workload is about one and a half times more than in the first quarter.

　　Currently, Wuhan Iron and Steel workers are concentrating their efforts on building the sintering plant, No. 2 blast furnace, No. 3 coking oven, and ore dressing plant; among them, the sintering plant is the most important. The slogan put forward by the workers is "Strive for steel, seize sintering, great collaboration, ensure May." The first phase of the plant to be put into production, sintering machines No. 1 and No. 2, can each produce 150 tons of sintered ore per hour. Its completion is decisive for ensuring that the blast furnace is well-fed. This plant has been stepping up construction since mid-February. In order to complete it as soon as possible, the workers decided to adopt the method of cross-operation of civil engineering and equipment installation, starting to install equipment before the factory buildings are built. In order to ensure that No. 2 blast furnace can get enough "food" after it is put into production, No. 3 coking oven is also being bricked, and the workers are determined to complete the bricklaying task on April 16th and start installing equipment. The civil engineering of the first and second rows of flotation machines in Daye Iron Mine has also been completed, and equipment installation is starting, which will be put into production in May.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, April 2nd: On the first day of April, the No. 16 open hearth furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Steelmaking Plant produced a heat of steel in five hours and thirty minutes, setting a new record for rapid steelmaking in large open hearth furnaces.

　　When the Class C workers of No. 16 open hearth furnace took over the shift at 24:00 on March 31st and started to carry out the steelmaking tasks for April, they were determined to ensure a good start for April. With the close cooperation of the loading machine drivers, they first shortened the time for loading cold materials by five minutes; when adding molten iron, the workers consciously extended the time by five minutes, which was conducive to the melting of cold materials. Sure enough, the time used in the melting stage was shortened to two hours and twenty-five minutes. Thanks to close collaboration in all links, they finally produced the first heat of steel in April with a record of five hours and thirty minutes. As of the afternoon of the 2nd, the entire furnace had produced five heats of high-quality steel for the country in the time it was planned to produce only four heats of steel.

    武钢二号高炉炉壳安装完成
    烧结厂选矿厂焦炉平炉将在第二季度中建成
    鞍钢十六号平炉创大型平炉快速炼钢新纪录
    据新华社武汉2日电　武钢二号高炉炉壳安装工程已在3月31日全部完成。为二号高炉供风的三座热风炉的炉壳吊装工程，也在同一天完工。
    二号高炉本体炉壳重达四百九十一吨，从3月19日开始安装到31日安装结束，只用了十二天又四小时，比原订计划提前十天完成。三座热风炉的炉壳安装工程，是从3月3日开始的。原计划十五天完成，结果只用了四天又十九个小时。这四项工程的建设速度，不但是我国历史上从来没有过的，也超过了新建武钢一号高炉的炉壳安装速度。
    现在，建设二号高炉的职工，正在进行准备工作，即将开始安装下降管、炉顶钢架、斜桥等金属构件和砌砖。他们决心进一步采取措施，争取苦战一百天建成二号高炉。
    据新华社武汉2日电　武汉钢铁公司决定“集中力量、重点突击”，确保在第二季度里将二号高炉、烧结厂、选矿厂和三号焦炉、一号平炉、二号平炉、耐火材料厂，相继建成并投入生产。这些建设的工程量比第一季度多一倍半左右。
    现在，武钢工人正在集中力量建设烧结厂、二号高炉、三号焦炉和选矿厂；其中烧结厂又是重点中的重点。工人们提出的口号是“争钢铁，抢烧结，大协作，保五月”。这个厂第一期投入生产的一、二号烧结机，每台每小时可产烧结矿一百五十吨。它的建成对保证高炉吃饱吃好具有决定性的作用。这座工厂从2月中旬起就加紧施工，为了使它尽快建成，职工们决定采用土建工程和设备安装交叉作业法，不等厂房盖起就开始安装设备。为了使二号高炉投入生产后能够得到足够的“食粮”，三号焦炉也正在砌砖，工人们决心在4月16日完成砌砖任务，着手安装设备；大冶铁矿的一、二列浮选机也已完成了土建工程，正开始设备安装，即将在5月份投入生产。
    新华社鞍山2日电　鞍钢第二炼钢厂十六号平炉在4月份的第一天里，用五点三十分钟炼出一炉钢，创造了大型平炉快速炼钢的新纪录。
    十六号平炉丙班工人在3月31日二十四点接班，开始执行4月份炼钢任务的时候，就立下决心，保证让4月份开门红。他们在装料机司机的紧密配合下，首先使装冷料的时间缩短了五分钟；兑铁水时，工人们有意识地把时间延长五分钟，这样有利于冷料熔化，果然，熔化阶段所用的时间缩短到了二点二十五分钟。由于各个环节紧密协作，他们终于以五小时三十分钟的纪录炼出了4月份的第一炉钢。到2日下午止，全炉在按照计划只能炼出四炉钢的时间里，已经给国家炼出了五炉优质钢。
