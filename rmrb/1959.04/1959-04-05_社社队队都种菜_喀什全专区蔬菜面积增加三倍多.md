    Communes and Teams All Grow Vegetables
    Kashgar Prefecture's Vegetable Area Increases More Than Threefold
    According to the Xinjiang Daily, Kashgar Prefecture in Xinjiang is seizing the opportunity to sow vegetables. This year, the vegetable sowing area in Kashgar Prefecture has increased more than threefold compared to last year, reaching a total of 175,000 mu. Yuepu Lake County, which only planted 380 mu of vegetables last year, has increased sharply to 8,000 mu this year. Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County, which rarely grew vegetables in the past, will also sow 2,000 mu of vegetables this year.
    With the development of socialist construction, the population of cities and industrial and mining areas in Kashgar has increased, and the demand for vegetables has increased. At the same time, the canteens of the people's communes also need a large number of vegetables to improve the lives of their members. Therefore, Kashgar Prefecture attaches great importance to this year's vegetable production. The Kashgar Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions to vigorously promote vegetable production. Counties and people's communes also arranged vegetable production early. Some communes also organized cadres and members to conduct free discussions, and the members were very enthusiastic about growing vegetables. The first batch of vegetables in Liangtian People's Commune in Shache County has been planted, and the second batch of vegetables is being concentratedly sown. The Hongqi and Dongfanghong communes in Kashgar City have sown 20,000 mu of vegetables by the end of March, striving to have some new vegetables on the market in April. In order to plant quickly and well, people's communes in various places have formed specialized vegetable growing teams to engage in vegetable production. In addition to establishing specialized vegetable growing teams in each brigade, the Hongqi Commune in Kashgar City has also drawn out the fourth and sixth brigades with better water conservancy conditions to mainly develop vegetable production to supply the needs of the urban area.
    While expanding the vegetable area, various places are vigorously increasing vegetable yields and striving for high yields. Many areas have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Most of the vegetables are planted on land that was deep-plowed last year, carefully cultivated, and fertilized before planting, and the seeds were soaked in warm water. In order to improve vegetable growing techniques, some areas also held on-site meetings or specialized vegetable growing meetings to exchange experiences and study technical measures. The Dongfanghong Commune and other communes in Kashgar City invited experienced old farmers to teach the members vegetable growing methods. Attention was also paid to the variety and quality of vegetables in various places. There are more than 20 kinds of vegetables grown in Kashgar City this year. In addition to high-yield vegetables such as cabbage and radish, there are also some nutritious and delicate vegetables. In addition to the vegetables that the Han people like to eat, there are also Kamagu, yellow radish, and Piyazi that other ethnic people like to eat. The Liangtian Commune in Shache County divided the spring and summer vegetables into four batches according to the production season of various vegetables to ensure that urban and rural people can often eat fresh vegetables.
    The expansion of the vegetable sowing area requires a large number of vegetable seeds, and various places have mobilized members to solve the problem in every possible way. The two people's communes in Kashgar City formed a purchasing team to purchase scattered seeds from the members' homes. The Dongfanghong Commune alone purchased more than 6,000 catties of vegetable seeds.

    社社队队都种菜
    喀什全专区蔬菜面积增加三倍多
    据新疆日报消息　新疆喀什专区各地正抓紧时机，播种蔬菜。今年喀什专区的蔬菜播种面积比去年增长了三倍多，共达十七万五千亩，岳普湖县去年只种了三百八十亩蔬菜，今年猛增到八千亩，过去很少种菜的塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县，今年也将播种两千亩蔬菜。
    随着社会主义建设事业的发展，喀什地区城市、工矿区人口增加，对蔬菜的需要量增大，同时各人民公社食堂为了改善社员生活，也需要大量蔬菜，所以喀什专区对今年的蔬菜生产非常重视。中共喀什地委日前发出了大抓蔬菜的指示，各县、各人民公社也及早安排了蔬菜生产，有的公社还组织干部和社员进行了鸣放辩论，社员们种菜的劲头都很足。莎车县良田人民公社第一批蔬菜已经种完，正在集中播种第二批蔬菜。喀什市红旗、东方红两个公社已在3月底播完两万亩蔬菜，争取4月份能有一部分新菜上市。为了种得快、种得好，各地人民公社都组成了种菜专业队组，从事蔬菜生产。喀什市红旗公社除了每个大队建立了种菜专业队外，还抽出水利条件较好的第四、第六两个大队主要发展蔬菜生产，供应市区需要。
    在扩大蔬菜面积的同时，各地正大力提高蔬菜产量，力争高产。许多地区都认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，蔬菜大部分是在去年的深翻地上种植的，经过了细致整地，种前施了好肥，温汤浸了种子。有些地区为了提高种菜技术，还举行了现场会议或种菜专业会议，交流经验，研究技术措施。喀什市东方红等公社请有种菜经验的老农向社员讲了种菜方法，对蔬菜的品种和质量，各地也很注意。喀什市今年种的蔬菜有二十多种，不但有白菜、萝卜等高产蔬菜，还有一些营养丰富的细菜，不但有汉族人民喜欢吃的蔬菜；还有别的民族人民喜欢吃的卡马古、黄萝卜、皮牙子等。莎车县良田公社根据各种蔬菜的生产季节，把春夏菜分为四批播种，以保证城乡人民能经常吃到新鲜菜。
    蔬菜播种面积扩大，需要大量的菜种，各地都发动社员千方百计地进行解决。喀什市的两个人民公社组成了收购组，到社员家中零星收购，仅东方红公社就收购到六千多斤菜种。
