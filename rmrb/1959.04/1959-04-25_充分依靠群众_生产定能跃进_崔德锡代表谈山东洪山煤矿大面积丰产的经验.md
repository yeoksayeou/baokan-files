Fully Relying on the Masses: Production Will Surely Leap Forward
Representative Cui Dexi Discusses the Experience of Large-Scale High Yields at the Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong
Chairman, fellow representatives:
I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou and the other leaders.

In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line for Socialist Construction, our mine’s entire workforce, like the people of the whole country, resolutely implemented the policy of taking steel as the key link for all-round leaps forward, the policy of simultaneously employing both modern and indigenous methods of production, and the policy of combining centralized leadership with large-scale mass movements. As a result, coal production achieved an unprecedentedly rapid leap forward, and planned targets were repeatedly surpassed. The annual planned output target was revised six times, from 1.08 million tons to 1.16 million tons, then to 1.3 million tons, and finally leaping to 1.58 million tons. The actual output was 1.627 million tons, exceeding the plan by 3 percent and increasing by 46.8 percent compared to the actual output in 1957. Tunneling, cost, and other indicators also overfulfilled the leap forward plan.

On the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, in order to achieve an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, the entire workforce of the mine determined the following: the annual planned coal output is 2.33 million tons, an increase of 43.2 percent compared to 1958; the production cost per ton of coal is planned at 10.3 yuan, a reduction of 2.5 percent compared to the actual cost in 1958. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party listed coal as one of the four major indicators for national economic development, which is a tremendous encouragement to our mine's workforce. The entire workforce actively studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continued to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and viewing the entire country as a single chessboard, and, with the spirit of hard work and ingenuity, launched a new high tide of production. In March, the daily output level reached 6,110 tons, an increase of 27.2 percent compared to the average of January and February, efficiency increased by 20 percent, and costs decreased by 20 percent; since April, production has continued to rise steadily, and the daily output level of the entire mine has increased from 6,110 tons in March to 6,600 tons in early April. Currently, a "six comparisons" red flag competition movement, centered on technological revolution and aimed at improving labor productivity and organizing large-scale high yields, is developing in depth.

However, our task of fulfilling the state's mission has not been without its challenges. In the early stages of launching the large-scale high yield movement in our mine in early March, the main obstacle was the "condition theory" of some cadres, who emphasized that the Hongshan Mine has thin coal seams and difficult geological conditions, making it difficult to achieve large-scale high yields. Other cadres and engineering technicians believed that large-scale high yields would require accelerating the pace of longwall mining, leading to increasingly strained tunneling operations. In summary, there were six fears: first, fear of tight cycles; second, fear that accelerating progress would mean production preparation work could not keep up; third, fear that rising tides would lead to increased tasks; fourth, fear of accidents; fifth, fear of changing conditions; sixth, fear of shortages in equipment and material supply. Since implementing the enlarged meeting of the Zibo Municipal Party Committee, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee's emergency meeting on coal, and listening to Vice Premier Bo's speech at the National Coal Mine Workers' Red Flag Competition Radio Conference on March 2nd, the cadres and workers of our mine have been greatly inspired and educated. Everyone, in response to the ideological problems at the time, organized two mine-wide debates with the themes of "Can Hongshan Coal Mine achieve large-scale high yields?" and "How to achieve large-scale high yields?". During the debates, the experience of the 52 mining area, which had consistently produced more than 10,000 tons per month for fourteen consecutive months, was summarized and exchanged, thereby raising ideological awareness and clarifying the direction. The number of high-yield working faces originally determined in the entire mine gradually increased from six to eight, and then to thirteen. According to the high-yield standards of 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 tons per month for thin coal seam working faces, only one working face reached the standard in February, but this number suddenly increased to eight in March. Among them, four working faces increased from around 4,000 tons per month to over 6,000 tons, with efficiency increasing from 2.535 tons per worker to 3.414 tons per worker; two working faces increased from 6,000 tons per month to over 8,000 tons, with efficiency increasing from 3.848 tons per worker to 4.524 tons per worker; two working faces increased from 8,000 tons per month to over 10,000 tons, with efficiency increasing from 4.36 tons per worker to 5.648 tons per worker. These eight faces actually produced 66,828 tons of coal in March, an increase of 29,474 tons compared to February, a rise of 78.9 percent; the average production efficiency increased from 3.86 tons per worker to 4.28 tons per worker. The daily progress of tunneling main roadways increased by an average of 55 percent compared to February, initially achieving "high yield on every face, rapid progress at every heading," and basically realizing the requirements of a 10,000-ton mine. In carrying out the large-scale high-yield movement, we mainly focused on the following tasks:

(1) Strengthening political and ideological education through various forms, and fully mobilizing the masses. In mobilizing the masses, our mine mainly adopted the method of "four deliveries" to the masses (delivering the situation, delivering the task, delivering the measures, delivering the key points), organizing the masses to carry out airing of views, debates, holding oath-taking rallies, grasping typical examples, convening on-site meetings, launching initiatives, and carrying out competitions, all centered around achieving large-scale high yields. In propaganda and education, in addition to explaining the achievements of the great leap forward in 1958 to the workers, we emphasized that completing this year's coal production plan is the key to guaranteeing 18 million tons of steel nationwide. At the same time, we also explained to the masses that the consumption of coal in other industries and for civilian use is constantly increasing, and completing the coal production plan is also of great significance for ensuring a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in other industries. We must produce more coal to guarantee the needs of the entire industrial development. Through a series of mobilizations and education, the planning concept of the broad masses of workers was further enhanced, and the idea of the whole country as a single chessboard was established. Many people took the initiative to examine their lack of drive and the idea of taking a rest. Among the 34 teams and 435 groups in the mine, 26 teams and 365 groups re-formulated new leap forward plans. The morale of the masses was extremely high, and everyone was full of energy. For example, the workers of the 51 mining team of the first vertical shaft proposed: "Reorganize the ranks and mobilize everyone, vow to turn low yield into high yield, seize every minute and second and boost energy, break through 200 cars in two days," and on the same day, the output per shift increased from 71 cars to 180 cars.

(2) Evaluating and summarizing advanced experiences, establishing role models, and widely launching a high tide of competition in "learning, comparing, and catching up." For example, in the March evaluation of the entire mine, ten advanced teams, twenty-four advanced shifts, seventy-six advanced groups, and four hundred and twenty advanced individuals were established, basically achieving "every mine has an advanced team, every team has an advanced shift, every shift has an advanced group, and every group has an advanced individual." For example, after summarizing the experience of Liu Qisheng's shift in the 54 mining team of the first vertical shaft in "stable, uniform, even, and segmented coal rolling," a pacesetter was established throughout the mine, and sixty-two groups in the mine promoted Liu Qisheng's experience. For example, the other two shifts in the 54 mining team, due to the promotion of Liu Qisheng's coal rolling experience, launched a competition between the three shifts, increasing the daily output of the entire team from 200 tons to 300 tons.

(3) Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the field, engaged in "experimental plots," cultivated typical examples, and exchanged experiences, achieving all-round blossoming. For example, Hu Chengye, secretary of the mine's Party committee, through cultivating experimental plots in the 52 team, cultivated the mine's first 10,000-ton working face, and specifically summarized the experience of deep cutting and fast running, segmented coal rolling, rapid movement of the scraper conveyor, and holding good pre-shift and post-shift meetings, and cadres taking the lead in grasping on-site management. As a result, the second 10,000-ton working face appeared in the mine in March, and six working faces achieved high yield standards of 6,000 and 8,000 tons respectively.

(4) Around organizing the realization of large-scale high-yields, mobilize the broad masses of workers to reform technology and promote advanced experience. According to the 36 articles of experience of the Ministry of Coal Industry (of which 12 are related to production), combined with the actual conditions of our mine, vigorous promotion was carried out. As of now, 14 kinds of effective experiences have been promoted in production, including 4 in coal mining, 7 in tunneling, and 3 in transportation. In coal mining, due to the promotion of multi-cycle, long cutting disc, rapid scraper conveyor movement, and rapid coal cutting experience, the mechanical efficiency was further improved, and the production of the working face was increased. March increased by 91 cycles compared to February, producing 18,200 tons more coal, which is equivalent to adding three working faces of 80 meters long. The current coal cutting depth of the seven coal cutting machines in the mine reached 2 meters, 2.4 meters, and 2.8 meters respectively, an increase of 0.2 to 0.4 meters per machine compared to the past. According to the calculation of eight mining working faces, the progress increased by 47 meters in March due to the increased cutting disc length, increasing the monthly progress of longwall mining in the entire mine from 61.6 meters in February to 83.2 meters, creating an unprecedented high speed of longwall mining.

In tunneling, the experience of deep-hole blasting, multi-cycle, coal hole leading, and drilling and loading interspersed operations has been vigorously promoted, greatly improving the tunneling progress. In March, eight headings in the entire mine reached the rapid progress standard, with the average monthly progress increasing by 52 percent compared to February, thus basically ensuring the connection of the mining area.

Although we have achieved the above-mentioned results, the development of the movement is still uneven, and the production level of advanced and backward units varies greatly, the completion of production indicators is not comprehensive enough, and accidents continue to occur. We will vigorously overcome these shortcomings in the second quarter.

The arrangement of the tasks for the second quarter of the entire mine is: an output of 646,800 tons, with an average daily output of 7,350 tons; a main roadway progress of 24,640 meters, with an average daily progress of 280 meters. The main measures for completing and overfulfilling the glorious and arduous tasks of the second quarter are to continue to resolutely implement the policy of considering the whole country as a single chessboard, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, combine soaring drive with scientific analysis, mobilize the masses to overcome difficulties in every possible way, strive to achieve a greater leap forward in the second quarter, and create good conditions for the over-fulfillment of the annual production tasks.

    充分依靠群众  生产定能跃进
    崔德锡代表谈山东洪山煤矿大面积丰产的经验主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理和各位首长的报告。
    一九五八年在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我矿全体职工和全国人民一样，由于坚决贯彻了以钢为纲全面跃进的方针，贯彻了洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针，贯彻了集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，因此，使煤炭生产史无前例的飞速跃进，规划指标三番五次的被突破。年度规划产量指标共修改了六次，从一百零八万吨增加到一百一十六万吨，又增加到一百三十万吨，后来一跃上升到一百五十八万吨。实际产量一百六十二点七万吨，比计划提高百分之三，比一九五七年实际产量提高百分之四十六点八。掘进、成本等指标也都超额完成了跃进计划。
    在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，全矿职工为了实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进，确定：全年计划产煤二百三十三万吨，比一九五八年提高百分之四十三点二；每吨煤的生产成本计划十点三元，比一九五八年实际降低百分之二点五。党的八届六中全会把煤炭列为国家发展国民经济四大指标之一，对我矿职工是个极大的鼓舞。全矿职工积极学习了党的八届六中全会的文件，继续贯彻了以钢为纲和全国一盘棋的方针，以苦干和巧干的精神，掀起了新的生产高潮。三月份日产水平达到六千一百一十吨，比一、二月份平均提高百分之二十七点二，效率提高百分之二十，成本下降百分之二十；四月份以来，生产还是稳步上升，全矿日产水平又由三月份六千一百一十吨，到四月上旬提高到六千六百吨。目前，一个以技术革命为中心、提高劳动生产率为目的、组织大面积丰产为内容的“六比”红旗竞赛运动，正在向深入方面发展。
    但是，我们对完成国家任务也不是一帆风顺的。在三月初我矿开展大面积丰产运动的初期，主要阻力是部分干部的“条件论”，强调洪山矿是薄煤层，地质条件困难，不好实现大面积丰产；另有部分干部和工程技术人员，认为大面积丰产要加快回采工作面进度，造成掘进越来越紧张。集中起来有六怕：一怕循环紧张；二怕进度加快生产准备工作跟不上；三怕水涨船高加任务；四怕出事故；五怕条件变化；六怕设备材料供应紧张。自从贯彻淄博市委扩大会议、山东省委煤炭紧急会议和听了薄副总理三月二日在全国煤矿职工红旗竞赛广播大会上的讲话以后，我矿干部和职工受到了很大启发和教育，大家针对当时的思想问题，以洪山煤矿能不能大面积丰产？怎样实现大面积丰产为题目，先后组织了两次全矿性的辩论，在辩论中总结交流了五二采煤区连续十四个月、月产万吨以上的经验，从而提高了思想，明确了方向，由原来全矿只确定六个丰产掌子，逐步增加到八个，以至十三个。按照薄煤层掌子月产六千、八千、一万吨的丰产标准，二月份只有一个掌子达到，到三月份就突增为八个掌子，其中由原来月产四千吨左右提高到六千吨以上的四个，效率由原来每工二点五三五吨，提高到每工三点四一四吨；由原来月产六千吨提高到八千吨以上的二个，效率由原来每工三点八四八吨提高到每工四点五二四吨；由原来月产八千吨提高到万吨以上的二个，效率由原来每工四点三六吨，提高到每工五点六四八吨。这八个面三月份实际产煤六万六千八百二十八吨，比二月份增加二万九千四百七十四吨，提高百分之七十八点九；平均生产效率由原来每工三点八六吨，提高到每工四点二八吨。掘进主巷日进度比二月份平均提高百分之五十五，初步达到了“面面高产，头头快速”，基本实现了万吨矿的要求。在开展大面积丰产运动中，我们主要抓住了以下几个工作：
    （一）通过各种形式，加强政治思想教育，充分发动了群众。我矿在发动群众的方法上，主要采取了向群众进行四交（交形势、交任务、交措施、交关键），围绕着实现大面积丰产，组织群众开展鸣放辩论，举行誓师大会，抓典型，召开现场会议，发起倡议，开展竞赛。在宣传教育中除向职工讲明了一九五八年大跃进的成绩外，着重说明了完成今年煤炭生产计划是保证全国一千八百万吨钢的关键。同时，也向群众讲明了其他工业用煤与民用煤均不断在增加，完成煤炭生产计划，对保证其他工业更大更好更全面的跃进亦具有重要意义，我们必须多出煤炭，保证整个工业发展的需要。通过一系列的发动和教育，进一步提高了广大职工的计划观念，树立了全国一盘棋的思想，不少群众主动地检查了干劲不足和歇一歇的思想，全矿三十四个队、四百三十五个小组中，有二十六个队、三百六十五个小组重新制订了新的跃进计划。群众情绪极为高涨，人人干劲十足。如一立井五一采煤队的职工提出：“重整旗鼓总动员，誓把低产变高产，分秒必争鼓干劲，两天突破二百关（车）”，当天由班产七十一车，提高到一百八十车。
    （二）通过评比总结先进经验，树立榜样，广泛展开“学、比、赶”的竞赛高潮。如全矿三月份评比中，树立了十个先进队、二十四个先进班、七十六个先进组、四百二十个先进人物，基本上作到了“井井有先进队，队队有先进班，班班有先进组，组组有先进人物”。如通过总结一立井五四采煤队刘其盛班“稳、均、匀、分段卷煤”的经验后，在全矿树立了标兵，全矿有六十二个小组推广了刘其盛的经验。如五四采煤队其他的两个班由于推广了刘其盛卷煤经验，三班并展开了竞赛，使全队日产由二百吨提高到三百吨。
    （三）各级领导干部，深入现场，大搞“试验田”，培养典型，交流经验，达到了全面开花。如矿党委胡承业书记，通过在五二队种试验田，培养了全矿第一个万吨掌子面，并且具体总结了深截快跑、分段卷煤、快速移溜子和开好班前班后会、干部以身作则抓现场管理的经验。因而三月份出现了全矿第二个万吨掌子面，并有六个掌子面分别实现了六千、八千的高产标准。
    （四）围绕组织实现大面积高额丰产，发动广大职工，改革技术，推广先进经验。根据煤炭工业部三十六条经验（其中生产方面十二条）的规定，结合本矿情况，大力地进行了推广，截至目前，在生产中已经推广行之有效的经验十四种，其中采煤方面四种、掘进方面七种、运搬方面三种。在采煤方面由于推广了多循环、长截盘、快速移溜子、快速截煤的经验，进一步发挥了机械效能，提高了工作面的生产。三月份比二月份增加九十一个循环，多产煤炭一万八千二百吨，等于增加了三个八十公尺长的工作面。全矿现有七部截煤机截煤深度分别达到了二公尺、二点四公尺、二点八公尺，每台比过去增加了零点二至零点四公尺。根据八个采煤掌子面计算，三月份由于加长截盘，就增加进度四十七公尺，使全矿回采月进度由二月份的六十一点六公尺，提高到八十三点二公尺，创造了史无前例的回采高速。
    在掘进方面，大力推行了深眼爆破、多循环、煤洞超前、打眼扒装穿插作业等经验，大大提高了掘进进度。三月份全矿有八个迎头达到了快速标准，平均月进度比二月份提高了百分之五十二，因而基本上保证了采场的衔接。
    我们虽然取得了上述成绩，但运动发展还不平衡，先进与落后单位的生产水平相差很大，生产指标完成的不够全面，事故不断发生，这些缺点，我们在第二季中要大力加以克服。
    第二季全矿任务的安排是：产量六十四万六千八百吨，平均日产七千三百五十吨；主巷进度二万四千六百四十公尺，平均日进二百八十公尺。完成和超额完成第二季光荣而艰巨任务的主要措施，是继续坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，把冲天的干劲和科学的分析结合起来，发动群众千方百计地克服困难，争取在第二季中实现更大的跃进，为全年生产任务的超额完成创造良好的条件。
