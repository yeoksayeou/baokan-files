Introduction to the Uses of Several Common Waste Products

    Hair
    Human hair is soft, strong, and has tensile strength. It can be made into hair felt for industrial oil filtration. Using this hair felt for oil filtration results in a higher oil yield than using textile felt. When twisted into ropes, it can be woven into durable fishing nets, used as filling for sofa cushions, lining for suits, and made into wigs and beards for the stage. Even short, broken hair clippings have uses. They can be used to extract protein for use as raw materials for injections and can also be made into fertilizer suitable for paddy fields.
    Bones
    When people eat pork, beef, mutton, chicken, duck, and goose, they always have bones left over. The bones of these livestock and poultry contain rich chemical components such as oil, gelatin, nitrogen, and phosphorus, which can be used to boil bone oil and bone glue, and can be ground into bone meal and burned into bone charcoal. Bone oil can be used to manufacture vehicle oil and machine oil, and can be used to extract glycerin and fatty acids. Glycerin and fatty acids can be used to make high-grade soaps and various cosmetics. Bone glue is divided into ordinary glue and refined glue. Ordinary glue is used in industries such as matches, construction, dyeing, and ink making, while refined glue can be used to make photographic equipment and pharmaceuticals. Bone meal is an organic fertilizer containing phosphorus and nitrogen, which is suitable for various crops. Bone charcoal is used for quenching machine parts, which can increase the hardness of the parts.
    Cattle leg bones and ribs, through the skillful hands of craftsmen, can be used to manufacture toothbrush handles, bone chopsticks, and carved into exquisite handicrafts such as bone fans, bracelets, necklaces, comb teeth, insects, fish, birds, and animals.
    Fish Scales
    The fish scales left over from cleaning fish also have considerable uses, especially the harder scales of large and small yellow croakers, black carp, grass carp, and carp, because fish scales contain a large amount of gelatin, which can be made into fish scale glue. This fish scale glue is transparent, pure, and white, and is a good material for making film and photographic plates. It can increase the gloss when used in printing and textiles. It is also needed in industries such as matches, leather making, and food. In medicine, it is also used to mix ointments, prepare medicinal solutions, and make the outer skin of pills. It can also be used to make artificial pearls and beautiful shells for accordions. The scales of ribbonfish can be used to extract a substance called uric acid, which is an important raw material for manufacturing caffeine drugs. The painkillers or powders we usually take for headaches and toothaches, and the A·P·C· tablets we take for colds and fevers, all contain caffeine.
   Rags and Rotten Cotton
   Worn clothes, shoes, hats, and scrap cloth and strips left over from cutting clothes should not be thrown away. They are all good high-grade raw materials for papermaking. For example, new scraps and white old cloth can be used to make banknote paper, security paper, drawing paper, cardboard, filter paper, and various special industrial papers. Dark-colored rags and cloth removed from shoes and hats can be used to make letterpress printing paper, offset paper, typing paper, newsprint, and cement bag paper. General inferior cloth can be used to make roofing felt and insulating paper.
    New scraps and cloth that is more than 60% new can be re-carded with a cotton gin and used to spin and weave cotton blankets, tweed, tartan cloth, tablecloths, gloves, scarves, thread, pockets, etc. It can also be used to weave homespun cloth.
    The main uses of rotten cotton are also for spinning, weaving homespun cloth, cotton blankets, colored flannelette, sofa cloth, etc. Rotten cotton and raw cotton can be blended and spun into yarn to weave canvas. It is also a raw material for manufacturing special industrial paper.
    Waste Batteries
    The structure of an ordinary dry battery is typically a carbon rod in the center, surrounded by a filler column made of a mixture of manganese dioxide, graphite powder, ammonium chloride, and water, with a zinc cylinder wrapped around the outside. This type of battery can generally generate electricity for fifteen to twenty hours. When it no longer continues to generate electricity, people discard it as waste. In fact, each part of it can continue to exert its "talents." For example, its zinc skin can be returned to the furnace to be smelted into zinc ingots and rolled into thin sheets to be remade into battery casings. The original chemical substances in the mixture filling the carbon rod can be extracted through processes such as calcination, filtration, and evaporation. Graphite powder can be used as a mold coating and to make paint and shoe polish. Ammonium chloride can be reused as a battery electrolyte, and it is also a raw material in the printing, leather making, and dyeing industries, as well as a valuable fertilizer. Manganese dioxide is mainly available for steelmaking. As for the carbon rod in the middle of the battery, the copper cap, and the insulating rubber caps at both ends, after processing and sorting, they can all be reused in batteries. According to statistics, one ton of waste batteries can recover the value of more than 200 yuan in useful materials.

    介绍几种常见废品的用途
    头发
    人的头发细软、坚韧、有拉力，可以制成工业上滤油用的发毡，用这种发毡滤油，要比用纺织品制的毡出油率高。拧成绳子后，可以编结成经久耐用的捕鱼网，还可以填沙发的垫褥，做西服的衬垫，制舞台上用的假发、假须。头上剪下的短碎发也有用，它可以提炼蛋白质，作为注射剂的原料，也可以制成适用于水田的肥料。
    骨头
    人们吃猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭、鹅肉，总是把骨头剩下来的。这些牲畜家禽身上的骨头，含有丰富的油、胶、氮、磷等化学成分，可以熬骨油、骨胶，可以碾骨粉、烧骨炭。骨油可以制造车油和机器油，可以提炼甘油和脂肪酸。甘油和脂肪酸可制高级香皂和各种化妆用品。骨胶分普通胶和精胶，普通胶用于火柴、建筑、染整、制墨等工业，精胶可制照相器材和制药。骨粉是一种含磷、氮的有机肥料，适用于各种农作物。骨炭用于机器零件焠火，可以增加机件的硬度。
    牛的腿骨、肋骨通过手工艺人灵巧的手，可以制造牙刷柄、骨筷，雕刻成骨扇、手镯、项链、篦箕梗、虫、鱼、鸟、兽等精制手工艺品。
    鱼鳞
    做鱼时剖鱼剩下的鱼鳞用处也不小，特别是鳞片较硬的大、小黄鱼，青鱼，草鱼，鲤鱼等，因为鱼鳞含有大量胶质，可以制成鱼鳞胶。这种鱼鳞胶透明、纯净洁白，是制造电影胶片、照像底板的好材料，用在印刷、纺织品上可增加光泽；在火柴、制革、食品等工业上也都需要它。医药上也要用它调药膏、配制药水、制药丸的外皮。它还可以制造人造珍珠和手风琴等美丽的外壳。带鱼的鳞可以提炼一种叫乌尿素的物质，它是制造咖啡因药剂的重要原料。我们平时头痛、牙痛时吃的止疼药片或药粉，感冒发热时吃的A·P·C·药片，就都含有咖啡因。
   破布烂棉花
   人们穿破的衣服、鞋帽和裁衣服剪剩下的碎布块、布条，也不要扔，它们都是良好的高级造纸原料，例如：新的碎布和白色的旧布，可制钞票纸、证券纸、绘图纸、钢纸、滤纸及工业上用的各种特种纸。深色的破布和鞋、帽上拆下的布，可造凸版印刷纸、胶版纸、打字纸、新闻纸和水泥袋纸，一般次布可造油毡纸、绝缘纸等。
    新的碎布和六成新以上的布，可以用弹花机重弹后纺织棉毯、粗线呢、格绒布、桌布、手套、围巾、线绳、口袋等。也可以织土布。
    烂棉花的主要用途，也是供纺纱、织造土布、棉毯、彩色绒布、沙发布等。烂棉花与原棉合纺成纱后，可织帆布。它也是制造工业特种用纸的原料。
    废电池
    普通干电池构造，都是中心是炭条，周围填充上用二氧化锰、石墨粉、氯化铵和水混合做成的填料柱，外围再包上锌筒。这种电池一般能发电十五小时到二十小时。当它不再继续发电了，人们也就把它当作废品扔掉了。其实它的全身各部分还可以继续发挥“才能”。比如它的锌皮可以回炉熔制成锌锭，轧成薄片，重新制成电池外壳。炭条周围填充的混合物，经过焙解、过滤、蒸制等加工过程，原有的化学物质还可以提取出来。像石墨粉，可以作铸型涂料，制油漆、皮鞋油等；氯化铵可以重新作电池电解液，它还是印刷、制革、染色工业上的原料，也是一种贵重的肥料。二氧化锰主要可供炼钢。至于电池中间的炭条、铜帽和两头的绝缘胶盖等，经过加工整理后，都可以重新用在电池上。据统计，一吨废电池可以收回以上有用材料价值二百多元。
