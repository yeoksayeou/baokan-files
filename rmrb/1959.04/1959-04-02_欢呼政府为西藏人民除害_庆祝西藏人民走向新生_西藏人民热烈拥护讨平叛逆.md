Xinhua News Agency, Rikaze, April 1st: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Rikaze City held a meeting on March 30th, warmly supporting the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and quell the Tibetan rebellion.

	The acting chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, Bainqen Erdini, delivered a speech to the Tibetan monks, laypeople, and patriotic figures at the meeting (full text to be published separately). In his speech, he called on the Tibetan monks, laypeople, and patriotic figures to recognize right from wrong, draw a clear line between themselves and the Tibetan traitorous group, support the orders of the Central People's Government, support the announcement of the Tibet Military Region, resolutely assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion, and thoroughly smash all the traitorous activities carried out by the Tibetan reactionary group with the support of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek group.

	Lamin Yixi Chuchen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, said at the meeting: "I support the State Council's order. Now that the reactionary elements have been cleared out of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, it shows that the central government's policy is very wise. I hope that in the future, we will unite closely, regardless of region, and work together to build a democratic and socialist Tibet!"

	Representatives from all walks of life in Rikaze spoke at the meeting. Guo Jie, a Tibetan cadre from an office, said: "Because the rebellious elements in the Tibetan local government betrayed the motherland and sold out the interests of the nation, it has been abandoned by the people. I resolutely support the State Council's order and will definitely respond to the call put forward in the Tibet Military Region's announcement with practical actions." Zewa, a representative from the Rikaze City Street Committee, represented all residents of the eight street committees in Rikaze in expressing firm support for the State Council's order, assisting the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion, settling down to production, and maintaining social order. Many representatives of mass organizations, Living Buddhas, Khenpos, officials, and the masses expressed their warm support for the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and quell the Tibetan rebellion in their speeches.

	At the end of the meeting, the masses unanimously adopted a telegram to the central government supporting the State Council's order amidst warm applause (Note: This telegram has been published on the first page of this newspaper on April 1st).

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 1st: People from all walks of life in Lhasa held meetings on March 31st, respectively, warmly supporting the State Council's order, denouncing the bandits, and celebrating the new life of the Tibetan people.

	Two hundred members of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Federation and the Patriotic Women's Federation expressed their firm support for the State Council's order at their meeting, requesting the People's Liberation Army to continue to eliminate the rebellious elements in some remote areas of Tibet, so that the masses of people in these areas can get rid of their suffering as soon as possible; and demanding that the masterminds of the rebellion be severely punished according to law. Many people said in their speeches that they would support and assist the People's Liberation Army in completely quelling the rebellion with practical actions. Angwang Dorje, a Tibetan youth who attended the Second National Congress of Active Builders of Socialist Youth, said: It is completely correct to dissolve the Tibetan local government that betrayed the motherland and undermined unity. This has removed a big mountain that was pressing on the heads of the Tibetan people. From now on, our vast Tibetan people will live a happy life forever.

	More than 280 Hui representatives from Lhasa unanimously and sincerely supported the State Council's order. Ma Mingzhong, a member of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, said in a symposium: To punish the traitorous elements and quell the rebellion is the ardent desire of the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Tibet; the State Council's order expresses the central government's deep and timely concern for the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Central People's Government.

	Hui elders Ma Liangjun and Ma Musha angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the bandits in Lhasa who plundered, looted, and burned. They said: The wicked bandits, who harmed the country and the people, committed heinous crimes. In one day, they looted and burned many houses and properties of people of all ethnic groups. Among them, the property of more than 20 Hui households was looted, and several Hui people's houses and shops were set on fire. The bandits also frantically burned the mosque, which has a history of more than 500 years, with a fire that lasted for days and nights. The two hundred people present unanimously said angrily: The traitorous elements must be punished according to law.

	At the meetings held in cultural, educational, and commercial circles, those present also firmly supported the State Council's order. Qinrao Wuse, a teacher at the Tibetan Local Cadre School, said: The people deeply hate the crimes of the rebellious elements who harm the country and the people, which determines the inevitable demise of the rebellious elements. Tibetan merchant Wangdui said: The rebellious elements used the fact that the Dalai Lama took the initiative to ask to see a play in the Tibet Military Region to deceive and confuse the masses, but the eyes of the masses are discerning. Who is protecting the Dalai Lama's safety, and who kidnapped the Dalai Lama, the facts are very clear. Wangdui described the situation he witnessed in the Gongbu area where the rebellious elements persecuted the people. He said: The rebellious elements looted property everywhere and forced the masses to act as cannon fodder for them. The rebellious elements are waving the banner of "protecting religion," but their actions are destroying religion and persecuting the people.

	The students of the Tibetan Local Cadre School also held a symposium on this day, angrily condemning the crimes of the rebellious elements. They expressed their intention to listen to the Party, strive to learn the skills to serve the people, and contribute their strength to the cause of the liberation of the Tibetan people.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 1st: People in towns such as Yadong, Zedang, Jiangzi, Heihe, and Dingqing in Tibet have held meetings in recent days, warmly supporting the State Council's order to completely quell the rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government. These mass meetings strongly reflect the Tibetan monks and laypeople's hatred for the wicked reactionary group and their love for the motherland and Chairman Mao.

	More than 400 patriotic figures, mass organizations, representatives of various temples and villages from all walks of life in Yadong held a meeting on March 29. The atmosphere at the meeting was enthusiastic. More than 200 people on the spot requested permission to take out hundreds of livestock to serve as transportation to support the People's Liberation Army in completely quelling the rebellion.

	When the Tibetan and Han staff in Zedang and Jiangzi heard the State Council's order on the radio, they immediately held a discussion, warmly supporting the State Council's order and firmly supporting the People's Liberation Army in punishing the rebellion.

	Heihe and Dingqing are areas where bandits have been rampaging. The herdsmen here unanimously expressed their firm support for the State Council's order to completely quell the rebellion, and said that they would actively assist the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebellion, not harbor bandits, not support the enemy, and report the bandits to the People's Liberation Army as soon as they discover them.

	Now, the State Council's order is being spread to rural areas and pastures in remote areas of Tibet. After people in various places learned about the State Council's order, they also held meetings one after another, expressing their firm support. At the meetings in various places, the lamas exposed the bandits' acts of destroying temples, and exposed the false guise of the bandits' so-called "defense of religion."
