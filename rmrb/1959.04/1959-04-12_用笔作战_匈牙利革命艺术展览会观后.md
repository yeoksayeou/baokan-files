　　Fighting with the Pen
　　——After Seeing the Hungarian Revolutionary Art Exhibition

    As we warmly celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian People's Republic, the Hungarian Revolutionary Art Exhibition has opened in Beijing. I visited this rich and colorful exhibition with great interest. The more than 230 works on display, including oil paintings and prints, gave us great encouragement and aesthetic enjoyment. Although many classical and modern Hungarian painters have long been familiar and loved by us, it is the first time to see such a large number of original works at the same time.

    As a cartoonist, I am particularly interested in the cartoon and poster art section of this exhibition. The cartoons and posters created by Hungarian revolutionary painters unify revolutionary content and beautiful form, and are full of fighting spirit and heart-stirring power. Each cartoon and poster has its own characteristics and strengths. Here, I will only select a few works and talk about some feelings.

    Szilágyi Jolán's choice of the image of mice as listeners to the "Voice of America" is meaningful. American imperialists are poisoning the world's atmosphere through the "Voice of America," issuing war cries, carrying out rumors and slanders, and promoting the rotten "American way of life." They have long been notorious throughout the world. The characteristics of mice are that they love darkness, fear light, and like to engage in sabotage activities, which is also a true reflection of the "Voice of America." It can be seen that the author is striking at those bad guys who stand on a reactionary position and smell like the "Voice of America." Of course, this painting also serves to warn people not to be fooled by American imperialism and not to listen to the nonsense of the "Voice of America." The image of the mice depicted in this cartoon is very successful: they are drinking and having fun, and their ugly faces are laughing wildly, but they cannot hide the emptiness in their hearts. The background is a broken wall, symbolizing war, which also sets off how dark this corner is. The arrangement and tone of the entire picture revolve around a prominent theme, which is simple and rich.

    Szilágyi Jolán's works are full of fighting spirit and ingenious conception. In 1941-1942, Europe was covered with dark clouds, and it was the era when the Hitler bandits were showing off their power. He painted "Soldiers Salute Goering" and "Goebbels: 'How Can I Tie Her Up?'" and other works, which sharply satirized the fascist war criminals and foreshadowed their inevitable demise. Goering, covered with medals, is reviewing the "troops," and rows of skeletons are holding up flowers to salute him, with a large area of graves in the background. This cartoon was made in 1941, when the Hitler bandits were frantically attacking the Soviet Union, but the author had already seen the inevitable consequences of the demise of the German fascist bandits and gave them a powerful mockery.

      "How Can I Tie Her Up?" depicts the wretched Goebbels, holding handcuffs, at a loss in front of the Venus statue, because this famous work of art has no arms. This work made a profound exposure of the fascist white terror, and it is also full of humor.

    The posters exhibited at the exhibition, like the cartoons, have won the attention and love of the audience.

    Biró Mihály's lithographic posters have bold and powerful strokes and a unique style. "Want a Red Parliament!" expresses the will and desire of the Hungarian working people with workers painting the Budapest Parliament Building red. The work is filled with the author's revolutionary passion.

    Félegyházi's "No!" The entire picture only has a leather boot about to step down, and the swastika symbol is composed of iron nails on the sole. The people will never be willing to live a dark life under the fascist iron heel and shouted "NEM!" (No!). It is just one word, but it strongly expresses the people's hatred of fascism.

    Szalay Dénes' "Algeria - Civilization of the Colony" poster depicts a young girl who is a symbol of the Algerian nation. The colonialist barbed wire seems to be shaking under the girl's angry and rebellious gaze. Yes! The Algerian people are in suffering, but this nation that will never yield is breaking free from the shackles of colonialism. This painting evokes great sympathy and respect for the Algerian people's unyielding struggle.

    From the works exhibited in the Hungarian Revolutionary Art Exhibition, we can clearly see the fighting tradition of Hungarian revolutionary artists. The artist's pen is the mouthpiece of the people and the weapon to strike at the enemy. When we appreciate these works, we have high respect for the Hungarian painters. Revolutionary painters, let us join hands and use our pens to fight for socialism and for the bright future of mankind!

　　用笔作战
　　——匈牙利革命艺术展览会观后
　　锺灵
    正当我们热烈庆祝匈牙利人民共和国建国十四周年的时候，匈牙利革命艺术展览会在北京开幕了。我怀着浓厚的兴趣参观了这个丰富多采的展览会。展出的二百三十多件作品，包括油画和版画，都给予我们极大的鼓舞和美的享受。虽然匈牙利的许多古典画家和现代画家早就为我们所熟悉和喜爱，但在同一时间内，看到这样大量的原作，还是第一次。
    我是一个漫画工作者，所以对这个展览会中的漫画和招贴画部分，特别感到兴趣。匈牙利革命画家所作的漫画和招贴画， 把革命的内容和优美的形式统一起来了，富有战斗性和震撼人心的力量。每一幅漫画和招贴画，都有自己的特色和长处，这里我只选择几幅作品，谈一点感想。
    西拉吉·约兰选择老鼠的形象作为“美国之音”的听众，是具有深意的。美帝国主义者通过“美国之音”毒化着世界的空气，发出战争叫嚣，进行造谣污蔑，宣扬腐臭的“美国生活方式”，在全世界早已臭名昭著。老鼠的特性是爱黑暗，怕光明，喜欢干破坏活动，这些也正是“美国之音”的写照。可见作者正是在打击那些站在反动立场、和“美国之音”臭味相投的坏家伙。当然这幅画也起着告诫人们不要上美帝国主义的当，不要去听“美国之音”胡说的作用。这幅漫画刻划的老鼠形象很成功：它们饮酒作乐，丑恶的嘴脸在狂笑，却掩不住内心的空虚。背景是象征战争的断垣残壁，也衬托出了这个角落是多么阴暗。整个画面的安排和调子围绕着一个突出的主题，是单纯的，又是丰富的。
    西拉吉·约兰的作品富有战斗性，构思也很巧妙。1941—1942年，欧洲乌云满天，正是希特勒匪徒耀武扬威不可一世的年代，他画了“士兵们向戈林敬礼”，“戈培尔：‘叫我如何捆绑她？’”等作品，尖锐地讽刺了法西斯战犯，也预示了他们的必然灭亡。挂满勋章的戈林在阅“兵”，成列的骷髅高举鲜花向他敬礼，背景是大片的坟墓。这幅漫画作于1941年，当时希特勒匪徒正疯狂进攻苏联，但作者已经看到德国法西斯匪军必然灭亡的后果，给以有力的嘲笑。
      “叫我如何捆绑她？”画着猥琐的戈培尔，拿着手铐，在维娜斯雕像前束手无策，因为这件著名的艺术品是没有胳膊的。这幅作品对于法西斯白色恐怖作了深刻的揭露，而且是富有风趣的。
    展览会展出的招贴画，也和漫画一样，赢得了观众的重视和喜爱。
    毕洛·米哈伊的石版招贴画，笔触豪放有力，具有独特的风格。“要红色国会！”用工人正在把布达佩斯的国会大厦刷成红色，表达了匈牙利劳动人民的意志和愿望，作品中洋溢着作者革命的激情。
    费洛的“不！”整个画面只有一只正要踩下去的皮靴，卐字符号组成了靴底的铁钉，人民绝不甘于在法西斯铁蹄下过暗无天日的生活，喊出了“NEM！”（不！）只是一个字，却强烈地表达了人民对法西斯主义的憎恶。
    沙拉·狄波尔在“阿尔及利亚——殖民地的文明”这幅招贴画里，刻划了一位作为阿尔及利亚民族象征的少女形象，殖民主义的铁丝网，在这个少女愤怒反抗的目光下像是在抖动。是的！阿尔及利亚人民在苦难之中，但这个永远不会屈服的民族，正在挣脱殖民主义的枷锁。这幅画唤起了人们对阿尔及利亚人民不屈的斗争寄予极大的同情和敬意。
    我们从匈牙利革命艺术展览会展出的作品中，可以清楚地看到匈牙利革命艺术家们战斗的传统，艺术家的笔就是人民的喉舌，就是打击敌人的武器。我们在欣赏这些作品的时候，对匈牙利的画家们怀着崇高的敬意。革命的画家们携起手来，用我们的笔，为社会主义，为人类美好的未来而战！
