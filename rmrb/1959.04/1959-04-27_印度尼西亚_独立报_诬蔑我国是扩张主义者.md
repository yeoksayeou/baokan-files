Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 25th: The "Independent" newspaper published a lengthy editorial on the 25th, expressing its hope that the antagonism between the two major Asian countries—China and India—would not escalate.

Although the newspaper expressed its desire for good-neighborly relations between China and India, it distorted China's consistent policy of freedom of religious belief. It said: China does not recognize religion as a part of national life. Therefore, it is understandable why those with religious beliefs would cause riots in Tibet. However, China still insists that this incident was caused by imperialists and reactionaries.

The author even slandered China as an expansionist, saying: The representatives of the National People's Congress have stated that imperialism and Indian "expansionists" helped the Tibetan rebellion. However, Nehru's speech on the border issue seems to accuse China of attempting to annex Indian territory. This means that, for India, China is an "expansionist."

    印度尼西亚“独立报”
    诬蔑我国是扩张主义者
    新华社雅加达25日电　“独立报”25日发表长篇社论，表示不希望亚洲两个大国——中国和印度——之间的对立会扩大。
    虽然这家报纸表示了它对中印两国睦邻关系的愿望，但是却歪曲了中国一向奉行的宗教信仰自由政策。它说：中国不承认宗教是国家生活中的一部分。因此，那些有宗教信仰的人是可以理解西藏为什么会发生暴动的。但是，中国仍坚持说，这次事件是由帝国主义和反动派造成的。
    作者竟然污蔑中国是扩张主义分子，他说：全国人民代表大会的代表们都表示帝国主义和印度“扩张主义分子”帮助了西藏叛乱。但是，尼赫鲁的关于边境问题的讲话似乎指责中国企图并吞印度领土。这意味着，对于印度来说，中国是“扩张主义分子”。
