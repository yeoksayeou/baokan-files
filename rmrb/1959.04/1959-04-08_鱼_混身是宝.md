Speaking of fish, people praise it for its fresh taste, delicate meat, affordable price, and high nutritional value. A fish, through the clever cooking of a chef, can be made into a variety of delicious dishes.

However, the uses of fish are not limited to these. The edible portion of a fish is only about 60%, with the rest being scales, bones, fins, swim bladder, and internal organs. These things are usually discarded as waste in ordinary households, but in fact, after processing, they can be made into very useful industrial and pharmaceutical raw materials, as well as livestock feed.

Fish scale glue made from fish scales is a high-grade industrial glue that can be used to make photographic film, movie film, and to prepare the light-sensitive coating on photographic paper. In the pharmaceutical industry, fish scale glue can be used to make capsules, ointments, suppositories, and hemostatic drugs. The surface of the ribbonfish's scales contains abundant silvery, shiny crystals called guanine. After chemical treatment, guanine is mixed into plastic or celluloid to make shiny, beautifully patterned penholders, accordion keys, or delicate imitation pearl hair clips. Guanine can also be used to manufacture guanine hydrochloride to produce caffeine, a stimulant used in medicine.

The internal organs of fish are treasures in themselves. The fish liver is a natural treasure trove of vitamins A and D. Fish liver oil made from fish livers is a familiar nutritional supplement. Pure large yellow croaker liver oil contains 100,000 international units of vitamin A and more than 5,000 international units of vitamin D per gram. Using fish liver oil as a raw material, "sodium fish liver oil oleate injection" can also be made, which can treat diseases such as hemangioma, internal hemorrhoids, and varicose veins of the lower extremities. Sharks and sea eels like to swallow small fish and shrimp and digest them quickly, mainly due to a gastric enzyme secreted by their gastric mucosa. This enzyme has now been extracted and made into a digestive aid. Fish bile tastes bitter, but it is very useful. Bile pigment calcium salt and bile acid salt can be extracted from fish bile; the former can be used to make artificial bezoar, and the latter can treat chronic constipation, bile deficiency, and diarrhea. Fish sperm protein extracted from fish testes can concentrate blood and is also a drug needed for surgery. Even small fish eggs can be used to extract valuable chemical reagents such as lecithin. The egg powder left after extracting lecithin can also be made into nutritious infant formula. As for fish swim bladders, after pressing and sun-drying, they can be used as industrial glue. The adhesiveness is very strong. If fish glue is used to bond two wooden boards of a weaving shuttle, they will not crack even after being used on a loom for several months.

Fish heads, fish tails, fish fins, and even spoiled dead fish can be used to make fish meal. This is a brownish-yellow powder with a protein content as high as 60%, making it a top-quality feed for poultry and livestock. China's exported fish meal occupies an important position in the international market. Fish oil can also be extracted during the fish meal processing. It can be used to make insecticides, anthelmintic powders, synthetic resins, leather lubricants, ore dressing agents, and cooling agents for metal cutting. After oxidation treatment, fish oil can be used as a raw material for soap; after decolorization and deodorization treatment, it can also be used in the paint industry.

    鱼——混身是宝
    提起鱼，人们都会称赞它味鲜肉细，价格便宜，营养价值高。一条鱼经过厨师巧妙的烹调，可以做成各式各样可口的菜肴。
    但是，鱼的用途不止这些。一条鱼的食用部分，不过60％左右，其余就是鳞、骨、鳍、鳔和内脏等。这些东西，在一般家庭里都当作废物丢弃，其实经过加工，可以制成很有用处的工业、医药原料和牲畜饲料。
    用鱼鳞做成的鱼鳞胶是高级的工业用胶，可以制照相胶片、电影胶片，配制照相纸上的感光涂料：在医药工业上，鱼鳞胶可以做胶丸、软膏、坐药和止血药。带鱼的鳞的表面含有丰富的银色光亮结晶，称为光鳞。光鳞经过化学处理，掺在塑料或赛璐珞里，可以做成闪闪发光、带有美丽花纹的钢笔杆、手风琴琴键或是精致的假珍珠发夹。光鳞还可以制造盐酸鸟粪素来生产咖啡因。这是医药上的一种兴奋剂。
    鱼的内脏处处是宝。鱼肝是一个天然储藏维生素甲、丁的宝库。用鱼肝制成的鱼肝油是人们熟悉的营养品。纯大黄鱼肝油，每克中含有十万国际单位的维生素甲和五千以上国际单位的维生素丁。利用鱼肝油做原料，还可制成“鱼肝油酸钠注射液”，能治血管瘤、内痔、下肢静脉曲胀等疾病。鲨鱼、海鳗喜欢吞食小鱼虾，而且消化得很快，这主要是靠它胃粘膜中分泌出来的一种胃蛋酶。这种酶现在已被提取出来做成帮助消化的药物。鱼胆味道苦，可是却大有用处。从鱼胆中可以提炼胆色素钙盐和胆酸盐，前者可制人造牛黄，后者能治慢性便秘、胆汁缺乏和下痢等病。从鱼精巢中提炼出来的鱼精蛋白，对血液能起浓缩作用，又是外科手术需要的药品。即使是小小的鱼卵也可从中提到贵重的化学试剂卵磷脂。提取卵磷脂后留下的卵粉，还可制成营养丰富的代乳粉。至于鱼鳔，经过压接、曝晒，可以作为工业用胶，粘性很强，用鱼胶把两块织布梭的木板粘合起来，在布机上使用几个月也不会裂开。
    鱼头、鱼尾、鱼鳍甚至变质的死鱼可以制造鱼粉。这是一种黄褐色的粉末，它的蛋白质含量高达60％，是家禽牲畜的上等饲料。我国出口的鱼粉在国际市场上占有重要地位。在加工鱼粉过程中，还能提取鱼油。它可以制杀虫剂、治虫粉、合成树脂、皮革润滑剂、矿石选矿剂和金属切削的冷却剂等。鱼油经过氧化处理，可作肥皂的原料；经过脱色脱臭处理，又可用于油漆工业方面。
