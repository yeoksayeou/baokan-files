    I have two children, both in full-day kindergarten. Whenever I get home from work, when I have nothing to do in the evening, I can't help but play with them, look at "picture books", tell a little story, and occasionally say a children's song. The children are particularly interested in children's songs. They listen attentively, want to learn as soon as they hear it, and repeatedly ask for another one. Unfortunately, I usually don't pay much attention to children's songs, and can only say: "Little sister, little sister, pick firewood to burn, pick it yourself, carry it yourself." If pushed, I can come up with: "Big sheep big, little sheep small, two sheep, run run run..." This is a text I memorized when I was in elementary school, barely enough to cope. Ashamed, I decided to buy a few books of children's songs to "enrich" myself. Finally, I bought "Sichuan Children's Songs" compiled by Tuo Lin, with paper cuttings by Lin Ximing.
      "Sichuan Children's Songs" is a very attractive little book, not only because it has very vivid and beautiful paper-cut illustrations, but also because the children's songs themselves are very touching. For example:
    Little bench, don't be crooked,
    Let my grandpa sit down.
    I'll help grandpa massage his back,
    Grandpa says I'm a good boy.
    It's both easy to say and full of life. From here, we not only seem to see the actions of a good child and hear the voice of a child, but also seem to glimpse a pure and kind child's heart, making people feel that this child is so lovely.
    In "Sichuan Children's Songs", there are many such good children's songs. Whether it's talking about "fireflies," "crabs," "baa-baa sheep," or "kitties," they are all so lively and vivid, with strong action, succinctly stating the basic characteristics of the object—those that children are most interested in, which they consider most important. For example, when talking about sheep:
    Baa-baa sheep, climb the city wall.
    The city wall is high, jump with four feet.
    The city wall is low, wag your tail.
    Little sheep, eat green grass.
    Eat green grass and grow wool.
    The wool is white, the wool is long,
    Knit a wool thread three zhang long.
    Here, not only are the vivid images of how sheep bleat, have four feet, jump and bounce, wag their tails, and eat green grass and grow white wool described in detail, but it also easily satisfies the innocent curiosity of children, and is very figurative and artistic. Do they have an educational effect? They do. Look, when talking about fireflies, it tells children that they are "shiny" little beetles like "lanterns" that can fly around trees; singing about crabs and cats points out their sideways crawling and love of eating fish; "Five Finger Song" and "Cross Song" teach children to count numbers, and children's songs like "Blacksmith's Twelve Months" teach children to distinguish the twelve months of the year and tell them about their relationship with production, life, customs, and habits. Aren't these all beginnings for children to understand the world? Isn't it enlightenment education?
    But even if children's songs are education, they are, after all, education for young children, and it cannot be separated from the special needs and acceptance abilities of the objects. "Sichuan Children's Songs" has done a very good job in this regard. Not only does their content conform to the tastes of children and their particularly simple life experiences, but they also have distinct characteristics in their form of expression: every sentence is so short, the content is specific, the meaning is simple, the rhyme is natural, and they are both good to listen to and easy to remember. Children love to sing them and can accept and digest them.
    There are also children's songs with strong political character in "Sichuan Children's Songs", such as:
    Caixin moss, blooming yellow flowers,
    For the New Year, slaughter chickens and ducks.
    Mom bought me a little horn.
    Blow a mi-so-mi-so-la.
    What tune? Emancipation tune,
    Makes mom laugh haha.
    I asked mom what she was laughing at?
    She said I am Chairman Mao's good baby.
    Red radish, sweet as honey,
    See it, see it, and it's New Year.
    Put on flowered clothes,
    Do the yangko all day long.
    Thinking of the past, celebrating the New Year,
    The landlord's child set off firecrackers,
    And drove me to the corner.
    Both describe the benefits after liberation and praise Chairman Mao and the new society.
    Whether it is "slaughtering chickens and ducks" or "wearing flowered clothes" for the New Year, it is all the joy of children celebrating the New Year. "Mom bought me a little horn, blow a mi-so-mi-so-la" is the joyful New Year scenery and mood, but it is still what the children particularly feel. Blowing an "emancipation tune" makes "mom laugh haha", so that in the end, mom praises the child as "Chairman Mao's good baby", which both praises the child and naturally educates the child to love the people's leader. It not only describes the joy of celebrating the New Year, wearing new clothes, and doing the yangko today, but also contrasts the fact that in the past, when the landlord's children set off firecrackers for the New Year, poor children did not even have the right to stand nearby and watch the excitement, and were even "driven to the corner". Here, joy is the child's joy, hate is the child's hate, and what is said and sung is all about the child's own affairs, so it can touch the hearts of children. Some children's songs that have too many abstract concepts, fail to grasp the psychology of children, and have dry language cannot be understood and loved by children, and their educational effect is poor.

### 谈“四川儿歌”

    谈“四川儿歌”
    马兰
    我有两个小孩，都在幼儿园日托，每逢下班回家，晚上没有事的时候，免不了和她们玩玩，看看“小人书”，讲个小故事，偶尔也说一个儿歌。孩子们对儿歌特别感兴趣，注意地听，一听就要学，而且再三要求再说一个。可惜我对儿歌平时很不注意，只会说个：“么妹么，捡柴烧，自己捡，自己挑。”逼急了，再来一个：“大羊大，小羊小，两只羊，跑跑跑……。”这是自己上小学时背的课文，勉强应付应付。惭愧之余，决心要买几本儿歌“丰富”一下自己。终于买了本拓林整理、附有林曦明剪纸的“四川儿歌”。
      “四川儿歌”是一本非常有吸引力的小书，这不单因为它有十分生动、优美的剪纸插图，而且儿歌本身也很动人。譬如：
    小板凳，你莫歪，
    让我爷爷坐下来。
    我帮爷爷捶捶背，
    爷爷说我好乖乖。
    又顺口，又有生活味儿。从这里我们不仅好像看到了一个小乖孩子的动作，听到了一个孩子的声音，而且，也好像窥见了一颗纯洁、善良的孩子的心，使人感到这个孩子那么可爱。
    在“四川儿歌”里，有许多这样的好儿歌。不论是说“萤火虫”“螃蟹”“咩咩羊”或“猫儿”等，都那么生动活泼，绘声绘色，动作性很强，扼要地说出了对象的基本特征——那些对孩子们说来最感兴趣的，也就是他们认为最重要的特征。如说到羊：
    咩咩羊，翻城墙。
    城墙高，四脚跳。
    城墙矮，尾巴摆。
    小羊小，吃青草。
    吃了青草长羊毛。
    羊毛白，羊毛长，
    打根毛线三丈长。
    这里，不仅把羊怎么叫，有四只脚，跳跳蹦蹦，尾巴摆动和吃青草、长白羊毛等生动的形象描述得很细致，而且容易满足孩子们天真好奇的心情，很有形象性、艺术性。它们有没有教育作用呢？也有。试看，说到萤火虫，就告诉了孩子它是“亮黝黝的”像个“灯笼”似的小甲虫，还能绕着树飞；唱到螃蟹、猫儿就点明了它们的横爬、爱吃鱼等等特性；“五指歌”、“十字歌”教孩子们数数目，“打铁十二月”之类的儿歌教给孩子们分清一年十二个月，并告诉孩子它们与生产、生活、风俗习惯的关系，这不都是让孩子们认识世界的开端吗？不就是启蒙教育吗？
    但儿歌即使是教育，毕竟还是对小娃娃们的教育，它不能离开对象的特殊需要和接受能力。“四川儿歌”在这方面是做得很好的。它们不但内容符合小孩子口味和孩子们特别单纯的生活经验，而且在表现形式上也带有鲜明的特点：每句话都说得那么简短，内容具体，意思浅显，押韵自然，唱起来又好听、又好记，孩子们爱唱，又能接受、消化。
    “四川儿歌”中也有政治性很强的，如：
    青菜苔，开黄花，
    过新年，杀鸡鸭。
    妈妈给我买个小喇叭。
    吹个米索米索啦。
    什么调？翻身调，
    吹得妈妈哈哈笑。
    我问妈妈笑什么？
    她说我是毛主席的乖娃娃。
    红萝卜，蜜蜜甜，
    看到看到就过年。
    穿起花花衣，
    秧歌扭半天。
    想从前，过新年，
    地主娃儿放鞭炮，
    把我赶到角角边。
    两者都描写了翻身解放后的好处，歌颂了毛主席和新社会。
    过年“杀鸡鸭”也好，“穿花衣”也好，都是孩子们过年的欢乐，“妈妈给我买个小喇叭，吹个米索米索啦”，是欢乐的过年光景和心情，但仍是孩子们所特别感到的。吹个“翻身调”“妈妈哈哈笑”，以致最后妈妈夸孩子为“毛主席的乖娃娃”，既夸奖了孩子，又很自然地对孩子进行了热爱人民领袖的教育。既描述了今天过新年、穿新衣、扭秧歌的欢乐，也对照了过去过新年地主娃儿放炮，穷人家娃娃连站在近处看看热闹的份儿都没有，还被“赶到角角边”。在这里，喜是孩子的喜，恨是孩子的恨，说的唱的都是孩子自己的事，所以它能打动孩子们的心。有些抽象概念过多、不能抓住儿童心理、语言枯燥的儿歌，便不能为儿童理解和喜爱，它的教育作用就差了。
