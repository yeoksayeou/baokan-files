Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 31st: The stories of "blind people regaining their sight and seeing the light of day again" are constantly emerging in various parts of Heilongjiang Province. In the past year, Heilongjiang Province has cured and restored the sight of more than 10,000 blind people and patients with severe eye diseases. In areas where prevention and treatment work has progressed relatively quickly, such as Lanxi, Tailai, Fangzheng, Boli, Yian, and the Duerbote Mongolian Autonomous County, almost all blind people or severe eye disease patients who could be treated with surgery or medication have received treatment.

The cured patients included blind people and patients with severe eye diseases caused by trachoma, pannus, glaucoma, cataracts, entropion, and trichiasis. In treatment, except for cataracts and glaucoma (such patients account for a relatively small proportion), which require more complex intraocular surgery, pannus, entropion, and trichiasis can be cured with simple external eye surgery. Those who have undergone intraocular surgery can also recover in about seven days.

Heilongjiang Province's approach to preventing trachoma and blindness is to "train ophthalmological medical personnel, form medical teams based on special districts, and concentrate medical forces in each special district to treat county by county." Each medical team is equipped with ophthalmologists from the special commissioner's office or county hospitals, who are generally capable of performing intraocular surgery. As for general external eye surgery, medical personnel from township health centers and secondary medical schools in the medical team can also perform it after training. Upon arriving in a county, the medical team goes deep into the people's communes and even production teams, obtains the assistance and support of the commune Party committees, and pastes white paper on the walls of civilian houses and disinfects them to become operating rooms. Medical equipment is simplified as much as possible, such as using sterilized razor blades instead of scalpels. The cost of medical necessities such as anesthetics and gauze is not high, and some are supplied by the county hospitals. Medical expenses are sometimes covered by the county or people's commune, and sometimes reduced-fee treatment is adopted. Party and government leaders at all levels attach great importance to carrying out the prevention and treatment of blindness and trachoma. The Party secretaries of many counties and people's communes have taken charge of the leadership of prevention and treatment organizations, and the Party committees have unified the allocation of forces from all aspects to cooperate with and assist the prevention and treatment work.

    大力开展治疗盲人防治沙眼工作
    黑龙江省许多盲人重见光明
    新华社哈尔滨31日电　“盲人复明，重见天日”的事迹正在黑龙江省各地不断出现。去年一年来，黑龙江省治愈复明的盲人和重眼病患者共有一万多人。许多人已重新参加了生产。防治工作进展较快的兰西、泰来、方正、勃利、依安和杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县等地，已基本上使可以用手术或药物治疗的盲人或重眼病病人都得到了治疗。
    治愈的病人包括因沙眼、血管翳、青光眼、白内障、内翻、倒睫致瞎的盲人和重眼病患者。治疗中，除了白内障、青光眼（这样的患者比重不大）等需动比较复杂的内眼手术以外，血管翳、内翻、倒睫等只要经过简单的眼睛外部手术就能治愈。动过内眼手术的，七天左右也就能痊愈。
    黑龙江省防治沙眼和盲人是采取“培训眼科医务人员，以专区为单位组成医疗队，各专区集中医疗力量逐县治疗”的办法进行的。每个医疗队都配有专署或县医院的眼科大夫，一般都能胜任内眼手术。至于一般外眼手术，医疗队里的乡卫生所和中级医校的医务人员，经过训练也都能担任。每到一县，医疗队就深入到人民公社甚至生产队，取得公社党委的协助和支持，把民房糊上白纸，加以消毒，就成了手术室。医疗设备尽量因陋就简，如用刀片消毒代替手术刀等。医疗必需的麻药、纱布等，所需经费不多，有的由县医院供给。医疗费有的由县或人民公社解决，有的采取减费治疗的办法。各级党政领导对开展防治盲人防治沙眼工作都很重视，很多县和人民公社的党委书记担任了防治机构的领导工作，并由党委统一调配各方面力量，配合和协助防治工作的进行。
