Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th – Cuban Prime Minister Castro, who is currently visiting the United States, sharply criticized the policy that the United States has been pursuing towards Cuba when he delivered a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors on the 17th.

　　Castro pointed out that the economic and political relations between Cuba and the United States have always been unilateral, with the United States occupying a dominant position. He requested a fair trade agreement with the United States so that Cuba could build its own economy. Castro said that the United States supported its puppet dictator Batista and, for many years, exploited Cuban resources and impoverished its residents to extract huge profits from Cuba. Castro said that our past economic relations with the United States were disadvantageous. Castro continued, saying that the United States never considered the interests of the Cuban people. The amendment to the "Joint Resolution" declaring Cuba "autonomous and independent" authorized the U.S. government to openly interfere in Cuba's internal affairs under the pretext of guaranteeing the "safety" of American expatriates and American "property" in Cuba.

　　Castro said that American newspapers published news about his visit to the United States, saying "he is here for dollars." Castro said: "People here are obviously accustomed to the view that people from other countries come to the United States for dollars. But we are not beggars, we are laborers. We are working hard and we want to build our country on the basis of self-reliance."

　　In answering many hostile and provocative questions raised by reporters, Castro refuted the lies spread by American newspapers about the revolutionary government's "massacre" and so-called "atrocities." He said that American newspapers never mentioned the atrocities of the Batista dictatorship, which killed as many as 20,000 Cubans during his rule. In his speech, Castro reiterated the justice of the Cuban government's trial of Batista's murderers. He believed that it was absolutely necessary to punish these bad elements in order to prevent them from torturing and killing the people again in the future.

　　Castro denied that he was a communist and refused to indicate which side he would be on in a hypothetical conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.

　　A reporter asked Castro whether he intended to provide weapons to other Caribbean exiles taking refuge in Cuba or whether he intended to adopt a policy of non-interference. Castro resolutely replied, "Our principle regarding relations with other countries is the principle of non-interference."

    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：正在美国进行访问的古巴总理卡斯特罗17日在向美国报纸编辑协会发表演说时尖锐地抨击了美国对古巴所执行的政策。
    卡斯特罗指出，古巴同美国之间的经济关系和政治关系一直都是单方面的，美国居于支配地位。他要求同美国签订一项公正的贸易协定，以便使古巴能够建设自己的经济。卡斯特罗说，美国支持它的傀儡巴蒂斯塔独裁者，多年以来曾经利用开发古巴富源和使居民贫困的办法，从古巴榨取了巨额利润。卡斯特罗说，过去我们同美国的经济关系是吃亏的。卡斯特罗继续说，美国从来不考虑古巴人民的利益。美国国会对宣布古巴“自主和独立”的“联合决议”的修正使美国政府有权借口保障美国侨民的“安全”和美国在古巴的“财产”而公开干涉古巴的内政。
    卡斯特罗说，美国报纸就他访美一事发表消息，说“他是为美元而来”。卡斯特罗说道：“这里的人显然习惯于这样的看法：别国人士来美国就是为了美元。但是，我们并不是乞求者，我们是劳动者。我们正在顽强地工作着，我们要在自力更生的基础上建设我们的国家。”
    卡斯特罗在回答记者提出的许多敌意和挑衅性的问题时，驳斥了美国报纸所散布的、说什么革命政府“大规模屠杀”和所谓“暴行”的谎言。他说，美国报纸从未提到巴蒂斯塔独裁者的暴行，在他统治期间杀害了二万古巴人之多。卡斯特罗在演讲中重申古巴政府审判巴蒂斯塔杀人罪犯的正义性。他认为，为了今后不让这些坏分子再来拷打和杀害人民，给他们以处罚是完全必要的。
    卡斯特罗否认他是共产党员，并且拒绝表明在美国同苏联发生冲突的假设中他将站在那一边。
    有记者问卡斯特罗，他是否打算向在古巴避难的其他加勒比国家流亡者提供武器，还是打算采取不干涉的政策。卡斯特罗断然回答说，“我们关于同其他国家关系的原则是不干涉的原则”。
