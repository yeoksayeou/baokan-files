    NPC Deputies and CPPCC Members Sternly Condemn British Imperialism and Indian Expansionist Elements for Plotting the Tibetan Rebellion.
    Any Shameless Act to Split China is Bound to Meet a Disgraceful Failure
    Vice Premier Ulanhu Warns Indian Expansionists Who Vainly Attempt to Inherit the Dishonorable Legacy of British Imperialism: “The Era When China Could Be Humiliated and Oppressed is Gone Forever. No Foreign Reactionary Forces Can Split Tibet from China, Save the Destruction of the Tibetan Reactionaries, or Prevent the Tibetan People from Advancing Along the Road of Democracy and Socialism!”

    Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: Ulanhu, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, today sternly condemned the shameless acts of foreign interferers attempting to undermine China's unity by exploiting the Tibetan rebellion at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. He warned those Indian expansionists who vainly attempt to inherit the dishonorable legacy of British imperialism, saying, "The era when China could be humiliated and oppressed is gone forever. No foreign reactionary forces can split Tibet from China, save the destruction of the Tibetan reactionaries, or prevent the Tibetan people from advancing along the road of democracy and socialism!"
    Ulanhu's speech was met with waves of enthusiastic applause in the venue.
    In his speech, Ulanhu pointed out that Indian expansionist elements have recently blatantly made various clamors to interfere in China's internal affairs, nonsensically claiming that China's sovereignty over Tibet "has no historical basis" and that the relationship between India and Tibet is a "mother-child relationship," simply treating Chinese Tibet as a part of India. Imperialists, while frantically attacking the Chinese people, desperately started up propaganda machines, provoking the friendly relations between China and India. He pointed out that British imperialists and Indian expansionist elements mistakenly take the friendly attitude of the Chinese people, who have always cherished the friendship of the Indian people, as weakness and vulnerability. They vainly attempt to split Tibet from China through the hands of upper-class Tibetan reactionary elements, turning it into their colony or protectorate.
    After Ulanhu listed a large number of historical facts to thoroughly refute the fallacy of "Tibetan independence," he solemnly pointed out in his speech: "The Tibetan rebellion and its suppression are both China's internal affairs, and no foreign country is allowed to interfere." He also said: "All those who truly care about Sino-Indian friendship and support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence must be highly vigilant against the sabotage of Sino-Indian friendly relations by imperialists and Indian expansionist elements."
    Ulanhu concluded: "Let those imperialists and reactionaries howl! Victory belongs to the people of all nationalities in China!"
    Fu Zhong, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, reported to the congress on the process of the People's Liberation Army quelling the armed rebellion in Tibet and the policies towards the rebellious elements, saying: We once again warn the rebellious elements fleeing in remote mountainous areas that if they do not quickly lay down their weapons and abandon darkness for light, they will be completely, cleanly, and entirely eliminated. If they flee to India, that is also a dead end.
    Xiong Kewu, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Deng Chumin, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, Hu Zi'ang, Deputy Director of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, and other responsible persons of democratic parties also angrily denounced the criminal activities of Indian expansionist elements interfering in China's internal affairs in their speeches today.
    Wang Shao'ao pointed out that the inflammatory and provocative actions of imperialism and all reactionaries can only end in a shameful failure. Chen Qiyou said, you Indian expansionist gentlemen who inherited the mantle of British imperialism, do not think that our country's utmost restraint in giving importance to Sino-Indian friendly relations is weakness and vulnerability; our restraint is limited. Deng Chumin said that the Tibetan reactionaries and their backstage bosses have misjudged the situation; they will only fail—forever fail! Xiong Kewu pointed out that if all foreign interferers disregard the great unity of the Chinese people, they will surely be shattered before the strength of this unity. Hu Zi'ang declared in his speech: Let domestic and foreign reactionaries dream their daydreams; our great motherland will forever stand like a giant in the world.
    Banda Doje and Gesang Wangdui, representatives of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Zhang Chong, Vice Governor of Yunnan Province (Yi nationality), Dao Jingban, Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, Shi Bangzhi, Governor of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan Province, and Dali Zaya, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, all expressed great indignation at the sinister conspiracies of Indian expansionist elements in their speeches today, expressing the determination of the people of all nationalities to resolutely oppose foreign interference and defend the unity of the motherland. Banda Doje and Gesang Wangdui said in a joint speech: The happy new life that the Tibetan people have long yearned for has finally arrived today, and we are extremely excited about this. If anyone dares to obstruct us as we move rapidly forward on the broad road to socialism, he will be completely crushed under the iron fists of our 650 million people.
    Huang Yan, Governor of Anhui Province, Jiang Yizhen, Governor of Fujian Province, Tan Yubao, Vice Governor of Hunan Province, Li Gengtao, Mayor of Tianjin, and Xu Jiansheng, Vice Governor of Guizhou Province, and other representatives today respectively introduced the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in their respective regions in 1958, and talked about the enormous superiority of the people's communes. The original economic backwardness of Anhui Province has undergone great changes. In 1958, it overcame serious floods and droughts, and achieved unprecedented bumper harvests of grain and cotton. Compared with 1948 before liberation, grain output increased by 3.8 times, cotton output increased by 10.7 times, and total industrial output value increased by more than 13 times. Guizhou Province, which has always been backward in agricultural production, produced more than 800 jin of grain per mu in 1958, calculated by cultivated land area, and completed the targets set by the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. After heroic struggles, the people of Fujian Province also achieved major victories in the struggle against the enemy and production and construction last year. These representatives all said in their speeches that on the industrial and agricultural production front in 1959, they will take big strides and continue to leap forward, and since this spring, a large number of good news of victorious progress has emerged. After rectification, consolidation, and improvement, the people's communes in Hunan Province have given full play to their enormous superiority. This year, the preparatory work for spring plowing and production in the province has been grasped earlier and more carefully than in previous years. Now, the transplanting of early rice has been fully completed throughout the province, opening up a victorious situation for the great leap forward in agricultural production this year. After the workers in Tianjin launched a red flag competition centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, they overfulfilled the first quarter's industrial output value plan and are striving to achieve greater victories in the second quarter.
    Many representatives who spoke at the afternoon meeting also talked about the vigorous development of various construction undertakings in our country. Su Qianyi, First Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the CPC, introduced the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Base. Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, talked about the great achievements in the Yellow River management work in recent years. Che Xiangchen, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, vividly described the gains of schools in Liaoning in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor. Wang Kunlun, Vice Mayor of Beijing, talked about the great leap forward in Beijing's health work. Tao Zhiyue, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, reported to the congress on the major achievements made by the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps in production and construction last year. Li Dongqing, Director of the Wuhan Women's Federation, introduced the contributions made by Wuhan women in the Great Leap Forward. Medical workers Bai Xiqing, Wu Zhizhong, Wu Huanxing, Huang Jiasi, Shen Qizhen, Wu Yingkai, Lin Qiaozhi, Zhu Futang, and Wei Xi and other nine representatives spoke jointly about the great development of medical science in our country. Mei Lanfang, Dean of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, focused on the issue of inheriting and developing the excellent traditions of Chinese opera, improving artistic quality, and training the next generation of opera workers.
    The afternoon meeting was divided into two venues. Other representatives who spoke were Li Hui, Wang De'an, Zong Xiyun, Liang Sicheng, Yang Shutang, Gao Fengqin, Lan Tian, Hou Baozheng, Wei Zhiying, Liu Baotian, Zhang Kai, Wang Dechang, Li Xikui, Zhou Qinyue, An Wenqin; Guo Yingqiu, Wang Jiaji, Yang Wengui, Yang Kuangbao, Li Fuxiang, Qian Changzhao, Hou Zhenya, Wang Xingyao, Shi Mukang, Liu Jingji, Rong Yiren, Hu Ziying, Hu Jue Wen, Tang Di Yin, Sheng Pihua, Wei Ru, Li Weiguang, Hu Wenyue, Mao Yisheng, Chen Fengtong, Zhou Zhihong, Zhang Wanhong, Xia Yikun. A total of seventy-two representatives spoke.
    The executive chairmen of today's afternoon meeting were: Cheng Qian, Lu Dingyi, Xie Juezai, Zhang Xiruo, Deng Chumin, Hu Yaobang, Wang Shao'ao; Luo Ronghuan, Ye Jianying, Xiong Kewu, Sangji Yexi, Hua Luogeng, Han Wangchen, and Li Zhuchen.
    Tomorrow is Sunday, and the meeting will be adjourned for one day. The meeting will continue on the 27th.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: The First Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC continued its plenary discussion this afternoon.
    Lu Han (Yi nationality), Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, Zhang Chaolun (Miao nationality), Director of the Health Department of Guizhou Province, and many other members continued to condemn the imperialists and Indian expansionists for interfering in our internal affairs by using the Tibetan rebellion in their speeches at the afternoon meeting. They warned the Indian expansionists: The Chinese people will not allow interference in their internal affairs, and dreaming of undermining the unity of all nationalities in China is a daydream. Pi Shushi, Chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, and Dong Wenlong, Yang Shida, Wang Wencheng, Zhang Jiashu and other members, in a joint speech, on behalf of the three million Catholic believers in China, resolutely opposed the despicable means of imperialism and its echo bugle--the Roman Curia--in using religion to interfere in our internal affairs after the Tibetan rebellion.
    A total of fifty people spoke at the two CPPCC venues this afternoon. Their speeches also covered various aspects such as the industrial, agricultural, cultural and educational fronts, and the content was very extensive. The older members were particularly pleased and encouraged by the prosperous scene of the great motherland. Many members continued to talk about their experiences in strengthening self-reform during the Great Leap Forward, and encouraged each other. Many members put forward suggestions for various practical work.
    The situation of the rapid development of industrial construction in our country was reflected in the speeches of many members. Huang Demao, a famous special-class labor model in Anshan Iron and Steel Company, has been transferred to Hunan Xiangtan Iron and Steel Company last year with the development of the national iron and steel industry. He introduced the construction achievements of this new iron and steel enterprise at the meeting. He said that the factory workers are determined to go all out to make steel flow out of Chairman Mao's hometown as soon as possible. Weng Wenhao recently inspected the large-scale Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, the well-equipped Shanghai Turbine Factory and Motor Factory in Shanghai and Zhejiang. He was pleasantly surprised by the scene of the people in various places working hard to build under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He said that Shanghai has changed from a consumer city to an important production base with both light and heavy industries in just a few years; even in the semi-mountainous areas of Zhejiang, steel plants, machinery factories, bearing factories, etc. are being built seriously. What a surprising and gratifying phenomenon this is. He believes that the plan for a continued great leap forward in 1959 will definitely be realized. Li Baosen said that my country's originally extremely backward bearing industry has now developed into an independent modern industry. Tao Shuzeng, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Association, and Huang Zhenxun, Chief Engineer of the Capital Construction Department of the Ministry of Light Industry, respectively put forward suggestions on the development of industries run by people's communes and the sugar industry.
    Farmers Zhong Chengliang, Gao Fengzhi, and Lu Guilan and other members introduced the great leap forward in agricultural production and the situation of planting experimental fields at the meeting. Member Zhong Chengliang said that the average yield per mu of grain in their commune's Sancha Management Area was 1,608 jin last year, an increase of more than five times compared with the best year before liberation. The living standards of the masses have generally improved. The biggest change was last year, and the average income per household in their village reached 350 yuan. He said: "We farmers understand from our personal experience that as long as we always follow the Party and run the commune well, we will definitely become richer and happier."
    Chen Wangdao, President of Fudan University, as well as He Binglin, Zhang Quan, Zhu Sui, Hu Shuhua, Xu Chubo, Wang Dafu, Yang Wei, Sun Zhongyi, and Liang Shoupan and other members expressed their opinions on the achievements on the cultural and educational front since the Great Leap Forward and the self-reform of intellectuals. Member Chen Wangdao said that the large-scale school-running movement in our country last year was unprecedented. He believes that the Party's prestige in cultural and educational undertakings has been completely established. During his inspection, he had discussions with many elderly and young teachers and students, and they all thanked the Party for making them successful in all aspects. At the meeting, he put forward two "unreserved" to encourage members of democratic parties: one is to unreservedly transform and improve themselves; the other is to unreservedly impart knowledge and cultivate youth. He Binglin, an 83-year-old man, enthusiastically expressed his excitement about the prosperity of the motherland at the meeting. He said that since liberation, the spring is warm and the flowers are blooming, and songs are sung everywhere. He has been a middle school principal since the end of the Qing Dynasty and has been a principal until now. Only the ten years after liberation have been the smoothest and most enjoyable. Although he is old, he has also made a leap-forward plan, expressing that he will cultivate more and better socialist construction talents for the motherland.
    Zhang Chukun, Wang Zhaojun, Jiao Huanwu, Tang Shaoyuan, You Jiajun, Xu Mengshan, Tian Fuda, Xie Xuetang, Wang Tianqiang, Qiu Lin, Su Ziheng, Chen Wen, Chen Wenbin, Yang Chunsong, Hou Ceming, Qin Yizhi, Ma Baosan, Ye Jujuquan, Qu Zhongxiang, Qin Bowei, Cai Fangyin, Jiang Zhaohe, Wu Xiaobang, Song Yunbin, Huang Yaomian and others also spoke at the meeting this afternoon.

    人大代表和政协委员严厉谴责英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱
    任何分裂中国的无耻行为必遭可耻失败
    乌兰夫副总理对妄想继承英帝国主义不光荣遗产的印度扩张主义分子提出警告：“中国任人欺侮和压迫的时代已经永远过去了。任何外国反动力量都不能把西藏从中国分裂出去，都不能挽救西藏反动派的灭亡，都不能阻止西藏人民沿着民主和社会主义大道前进！”
    新华社25日讯　中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理、内蒙古自治区主席乌兰夫，今天下午在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上严厉地谴责了外国干涉者企图利用西藏叛乱破坏中国统一的无耻行为。他警告那些妄想继承英帝国主义不光荣遗产的印度扩张主义分子说：“中国任人欺侮和压迫的时代已经永远过去了。任何外国反动力量都不能把西藏从中国分裂出去，都不能挽救西藏反动派的灭亡，都不能阻止西藏人民沿着民主和社会主义大道前进！”
    乌兰夫代表的发言，在会场上引起了一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
    乌兰夫在发言中指出，印度扩张主义分子最近露骨地发出了各种干涉中国内政的叫嚣，胡说甚么中国对西藏的主权“没有历史根据”，印度和西藏的关系是“母子关系”等等，简直把中国的西藏当成了印度的一部分。帝国主义则在疯狂攻击中国人民的同时，拚命开动宣传机器，挑拨中国和印度的友好关系。他指出，英帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子把中国人民一向珍视印度人民的友谊的友好态度，错误地当做软弱可欺，他们妄想经过西藏上层反动分子的手，把西藏从中国分裂出去，成为它们的殖民地或保护国。
    乌兰夫列举大量历史事实彻底驳斥了所谓“西藏独立”的谬论以后，他在发言中郑重指出：“西藏叛乱和西藏叛乱的平定，都是中国的内政，绝不允许任何外国加以干涉。”他还说：“一切真正关心中印友好和拥护和平共处五项原则的人，都必须高度警惕帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子对中印友好关系的破坏。”
    乌兰夫最后说：“让那些帝国主义和反动派去嚎叫吧，胜利是属于中国各民族人民的！”
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任傅锺代表，向大会报告了人民解放军平定西藏武装叛乱的经过和对待叛乱分子的政策以后说：我们再一次警告流窜在偏僻山区的叛乱分子，他们如不迅速放下武器，弃暗投明，就将被彻底、干净、全部消灭，他们逃亡到印度去，那也只是绝路一条。

    王绍鏊指出，帝国主义和一切反动派的煽风点火和挑拨离间，最后只能落得可耻失败的下场。陈其尤说，继承英帝国主义衣钵的印度扩张主义先生们，你们不要以为我国以中印友好关系为重而表现出的最大克制是软弱可欺，我们的克制是有限度的。邓初民说，西藏反动派及其后台老板把形势估计错了，他们只有失败——永远的失败！熊克武指出，一切外国干涉者如果无视中国人民的伟大团结，就一定会在这个团结的力量面前碰得头破血流。胡子昂在发言中宣称：让国内外反动分子们尽管去白日作梦吧，我们伟大的祖国将永远永远象巨人般屹立于世界。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会委员邦达多吉代表和格桑旺堆代表、云南省副省长张冲代表（彝族）、云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州州长刀京版代表、湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州州长石邦智代表和内蒙古自治区副主席达理札雅代表，在今天的发言中都对印度扩张主义分子的罪恶阴谋表示极大愤慨，表达了各族人民坚决反对外国干涉和保卫祖国统一的决心。邦达多吉和格桑旺堆在联合发言中说：西藏人民所长期盼望的幸福的新生活，今天终于来到了，我们为此感到极大的兴奋。在我们走向社会主义的康庄大道上迅速前进的时候，如果有谁敢于阻挠，他必将在我国六亿五千万人民的铁拳下彻底粉碎。

    民革中央常务委员卢汉（彝族）、贵州省卫生厅厅长张超伦（苗族）等许多委员在下午大会的发言中，继续谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子利用西藏叛乱事件干涉我国内政。他们正告印度扩张主义分子：中国人民的内政不容干涉，妄图破坏中国各民族的团结是白日做梦。中国天主教友爱国会主席皮漱石以及董文隆、杨士达、王文成、张家树等委员在联合发言中，代表中国天主教三百万教友，坚决反对帝国主义和它的应声虫——罗马教廷在西藏叛乱事件发生后利用宗教干涉我国内政的卑鄙手段。
    下午在两个政协会场上发言的共有五十人。他们的发言还涉及了工、农、文教战线等各个方面，内容十分广泛。年老的委员们对伟大祖国的一派兴旺气象特别感到欢欣鼓舞。许多委员继续畅谈了他们在大跃进中加强自我改造的体会，并且互相勉励。不少委员对各项实际工作提出了建议。
    我国工业建设飞跃发展的形势，在许多委员的发言中得到了反映。著名鞍山市特等劳动模范黄德茂委员，随着全国钢铁工业的发展，去年已调到湖南湘潭钢铁公司工作。他在会上介绍了这个新建钢铁企业的建设成就。他说，建厂职工们决心鼓足干劲，要尽快地使毛主席故乡早日流出钢水来。翁文灏委员最近到上海和浙江视察了规模宏大的新安江水电站、设备精良的上海汽轮机厂和电机厂等。各地人民在共产党和毛主席领导下勤奋建设的情景，使他感到惊喜。他说，上海只几年功夫已由消费城市一变而成为轻重工业都很重要的生产基地；就是在浙江的半山区，也在认真地建设钢铁厂、机械厂、轴承厂等。这是何等惊人而可喜的现象。他认为，1959年的继续大跃进计划一定能够实现。李保森委员谈到，我国原来极端落后的轴承工业，现在已发展成为独立的近代化工业。湖北省科学技术协会副主席 陶述曾、轻工业部基本建设司总工程师黄振勋等委员，分别就发展人民公社办的工业和制糖工业等提出了建议。

    复旦大学校长陈望道，以及何炳麟、张铨、朱遂、胡庶华、徐楚波、王达甫、杨伟、孙仲逸、梁守槃等委员，分别就大跃进以来文教战线上的成就和知识分子的自我改造问题发表意见。陈望道委员说，去年我国那样声势浩大的办学运动是前所未有的。他认为，党在文教事业中的威信已经完全确立起来。他在视察时曾经同许多老年、青年教师和学生座谈，他们都感谢党在各方面使他们有所成就。会上，他提出了两个“无保留”，同民主党派成员共勉：一是无保留地改造自己，提高自己；一是无保留地传授知识，培养青年。八十三岁老人何炳麟委员，在会上热情地表达了对祖国繁荣兴旺的兴奋之情。他说，解放以来，春暖花开，遍地弦歌。他从清末起当中学校长，一直当到现在，就只有解放后的十年当得最顺手，最痛快。他虽已年老，也订了跃进规划，表示要为祖国培养出更多更好的社会主义建设人材。
