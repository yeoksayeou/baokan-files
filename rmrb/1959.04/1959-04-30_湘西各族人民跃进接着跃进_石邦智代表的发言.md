Comrades Representatives,

In the ten years since the founding of our great motherland, the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has carried out a series of vigorous social reform movements and socialist construction. After 1956, through the nationwide rectification campaign, the struggle against rightists, and the struggle against local nationalism, we achieved great victories in ideology and politics. On the basis of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, we realized the people's commune system. After these movements, the face of our minority area has undergone extremely profound changes. The disastrous days when we were under the cruel oppression and exploitation of the reactionary feudal ruling class for a long time have long gone, and we are gradually changing the state of "poor and blank." Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in the state are energetic and high-spirited, and are leaping forward along the socialist road at a rapid pace.

Unprecedented Harvest in Agriculture, Industry from Scratch

1958 was a very extraordinary year, and also a year of comprehensive great leap forward for our state. In this year, agricultural production in the state achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output reached 1.8 billion jin, an increase of 59.2% over 1957, more than twice the total growth in the first five-year plan. The number of live pigs reached more than 1.25 million, an increase of 88.6% over 1957. Other economic crops such as tung oil, tea oil, citrus, ramie, and tea also achieved large-scale bumper harvests. The reason why agricultural production can achieve such a great leap forward and there are many high-yield banners is because the vast number of rural cadres further implemented the Party's mass line working method and correctly implemented the "Eight-Character Charter of Agriculture." In 1958 alone, we built and repaired 96,074 large and small water conservancy projects, increasing the irrigated area by more than 700,000 mu; a total of 1.1 billion dan of various fine fertilizers were accumulated, and an average of 480 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu of field; in terms of implementing reasonable close planting, promoting improved varieties, promoting double-season rice, double-season corn, and appropriately advancing the season, many reforms have been carried out according to local conditions. The backward production methods of "slash-and-burn" and "extensive planting and low harvesting," which were still relatively common in the early days of liberation, have basically been changed to "intensive cultivation and meticulous work" and "less planting and more harvesting."

The great leap forward in agricultural production has greatly promoted the great leap forward in industrial production. In the past, our autonomous prefecture had no industry at all except for a little handicraft industry, let alone heavy industry. However, since last year's nationwide mass industrialization and steel-making campaign, the movement to run industry throughout the state has developed extremely rapidly, blooming everywhere, scattered in towns and villages. There are 175 factories and mines run by the state and counties alone, and more than 2,800 factories and mines run by the people's communes. We never knew how steel was made. In less than four months from September last year, we produced 4,430 tons of native steel and 19,722 tons of iron. Last year's total industrial output value reached more than 80 million yuan, accounting for 25% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, an increase of 26 times compared with 1952, the year before the first five-year plan. The transportation industry in the autonomous prefecture is also developing rapidly. The highway network and postal and telecommunications network with Jishou as the center have been basically formed. The existing highways open to traffic total 928 kilometers, an increase of more than four times compared with the 170 kilometers before liberation; the existing navigable waterways total 3,337 kilometers, an increase of five times compared with the 557 kilometers before liberation. Now, all counties in the state have access to automobiles (only three counties had access to automobiles before liberation, and seven counties did not), and more than half of the communes have access to automobiles. Telephones are connected to every team.

Material and Cultural Living Standards Improve Accordingly

With the great leap forward in production, the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups in the state have also improved accordingly. Everyone knows that in the era of the reactionary feudal landlord class rule, the vast majority of poor peasants in minority areas lived inhuman lives. It was truly the so-called "sickle hanging on the wall, no food at home," and they were in a deep abyss of suffering from lack of food and clothing, poverty and disease for years. Many people relied on going up the mountains to dig ferns and collect kudzu to maintain their lives. However, the current situation is very different from the past. In 1958, the social purchasing power of the state averaged 40.89 yuan per person, and the average person had 891 jin of grain (of which more than 600 jin were staple food). In terms of culture and education, there are more than 280,000 primary school students in the state, and more than 95% of school-age children are enrolled, an increase of nearly 20 times compared with more than 15,000 before liberation; there are 31,032 middle school students (including 14,869 run by the people). An increase of more than 20 times compared with more than 1,400 in the early days of liberation; and for the first time, a university of their own was established for the people of all ethnic groups. Among the 620,000 illiterate and semi-literate people, more than 540,000 have a rough understanding of writing. In terms of medical and health care, the number of beds in Western medicine and Chinese medicine hospitals has reached 3,101, an increase of nearly 10 times compared with 1952, the incidence of various infectious diseases has been greatly reduced, and the infant mortality rate has been reduced to 0.2%.

All this shows how significant changes have taken place in the lives and mental outlook of the people of all ethnic groups! I would like to introduce the situation of Huoyanshan in Longshan County to all the representatives: This mountain stretches for more than 90 miles, with an altitude of more than 1,000 meters above sea level. Before liberation, it was a place where bandits haunted. Originally, there were 1,500 households of Tujia and Miao people living here, but due to looting and killing by bandits, disasters and diseases, the people suffered unspeakably. Therefore, only 429 households were left by the time of liberation. At that time, the mountains were full of thorns, the fields were barren, wolves and tigers were in groups, and wild boars were in packs. The masses lived in caves, ate kudzu cakes and stone garlic, wore tattered raincoats to keep out the cold during the day in winter, and roasted fire all night long. "Don't marry to Huoyanshan," the girls at the foot of the mountain were unwilling to marry into the mountains. However, now this place has become a socialist paradise like a garden. Last year, the grain output in this area increased 21 times compared with the time of liberation; each household raised an average of 7.7 pigs and 26 chickens, and the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries averaged 125 yuan per person. Primary schools, amateur red and expert schools, nurseries, kindergartens, health centers, and clubs have been established, all school-age children have been enrolled, 80% of the young and middle-aged people have removed the hat of illiteracy, telephones are accessible in all directions, broadcasts resound through the mountains, and people are no longer short of food and clothing, and girls are also willing to go to the mountains. The masses expressed their heartfelt gratitude and love for the Party and Chairman Mao. They said: "Our lives were saved by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and our happiness was brought by cooperation and communization." They enthusiastically praised the people's commune. A Miao song said: "The red flag is planted on Miaoling Mountain, Miaoling Mountain shakes and the water boils, everyone sings the praises of the commune, like carp leaping over the dragon gate."

Some people once believed that minority areas are "backward," "high mountain areas are cold, agriculture cannot produce high yields," "culture and technology are backward, and industry cannot be developed," etc. Therefore, they believed that the socialist construction of minority areas can only be slow and cannot leap forward. This argument has been thoroughly shattered by the eloquent facts.

Why can we achieve such a great leap forward in our minority areas? As Premier Zhou pointed out in the "Government Work Report," due to the completion of democratic reforms and the basic completion of socialist transformation, and on this basis, the realization of the people's commune system, we have a social system that can adapt to the needs of production development. Premier Zhou especially pointed out: "The most important reason for the great leap forward in 1958 is that we summarized the experience of the first five-year plan in the spring of 1958, and began to find a better way to build socialism in our country, and formulated the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results." I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's instructions in the report.

Continue to Work Hard and Build the Autonomous Prefecture into a Socialist Paradise of National Unity

Of course, we cannot be satisfied with the great leap forward in 1958. We will achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. According to the principle of "the whole country as a chessboard," the autonomous prefecture has formulated this year's production plan, with a grain output of more than 3.1 billion jin, an increase of 67% over 1958; 2,000 tons of steel, an increase of nearly five times over 1958; 30,000 tons of iron, an increase of nearly 50% over 1958. Other production indicators have also increased significantly. This plan is a leap forward, and it is also practical and reliable. I think as long as we earnestly do the following points, we are fully confident of completing the 1959 plan:

First, we must strengthen the Party's leadership and earnestly implement the Party's ethnic policies. The Party is the representative and defender of the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. It is the core force that unites and leads the people of all ethnic groups to build socialism. Without the Party's leadership or weakening the Party's leadership, there would be no prosperity and happiness for the nation, and there would be no socialist society.

Second, we must resolutely implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, carry out the struggle between the two roads on all fronts, and guide the minority people to continue to advance on the broad road of socialism.

Third, continue to break superstitions, liberate our minds, break the "backwardness theory" and "conditionalism" of minority areas, and promote the style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and the spirit of having both soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis.

Fourth, develop and consolidate the great unity, great support, and great cooperation among all ethnic groups, and promote the great development of socialist cause.

Comrades Representatives! Under the unified leadership of the Party, I believe that we will be able to complete and overfulfill this year's plan, and we will be able to build our autonomous prefecture into a socialist paradise of national unity with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in the not-too-distant future. All ethnic groups in our country will unite more closely and work together to build socialism and communism. We absolutely cannot tolerate those traitors and scum who collude with imperialist aggressor forces and attempt to undermine the unity of the motherland and national unity. The armed rebellion recently launched by the former local government of Tibet and the upper-level reactionary group has been resolutely opposed by the people of all ethnic groups in the country. We firmly support the State Council's order to quell the rebellion of reactionary elements in Tibet. We warmly congratulate the great victory in quelling the Tibetan rebellion, and at the same time, we are very fortunate that the Tibetan people now have the opportunity to get rid of the shackles of the serf system and realize their desire for democratic autonomy and social progress. We believe that with the help of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, the Tibetan people will surely build the Tibetan Plateau into a true paradise on earth.

    湘西各族人民跃进接着跃进
    石邦智代表的发言各位代表：
    湘西土家族、苗族自治州在我们伟大的祖国建国的十年之间，进行了一系列轰轰烈烈的社会改革运动和社会主义的建设。一九五六年以后，经过全民整风、反右派斗争和反对地方民族主义的斗争，我们在思想上和政治上取得了伟大的胜利。在一九五八年工农业生产大跃进的基础上，我们实现了人民公社化。经过这些运动以后，我们这个少数民族地区的面貌，已经发生了极其深刻的变化，过去长期处在反动封建统治阶级残酷的压迫和剥削下的那种灾难重重的日子，早已一去不返了，并且正在逐步改变“一穷二白”的状态。全州各族人民，在党和毛主席的英明领导之下，群情奋发，众志昂扬，正在一日千里地沿着社会主义的道路飞跃前进。
    农业空前丰收，工业从无到有
    一九五八年是非常不平凡的一年，也是我们全州全面大跃进的一年。在这一年，全州农业生产获得了空前的大丰收，粮食总产量达到十八亿斤，比一九五七年增加了百分之五十九点二，比第一个五年计划五年增长的总和还多两倍。生猪达到了一百二十五万多头，比一九五七年增加了百分之八十八点六。其它如桐油、茶油、柑桔、苎麻、茶叶等许多经济作物，也都获得了大面积丰产的成绩。农业生产能够取得这样巨大的跃进，并且出现了许多高额丰产的旗帜，是由于广大农村干部进一步贯彻了党的群众路线的工作方法，正确地执行了“八字宪法”。仅仅一九五八年这一年，我们就兴修和修复了大小水利九万六千零七十四处，增加灌溉面积七十多万亩；共积各种精肥十一亿担，每亩田平均下肥料四百八十担；在实行合理密植、推广良种、推广双季稻、双季包谷、适当提早季节等方面，都因地制宜地进行了许多改革。解放初期还较为普遍的“刀耕火种”、“广种薄收”的落后生产方式，基本上已经改变为“精耕细作”、“少种多收”了。
    农业生产的大跃进又大大推动了工业生产的大跃进。我们自治州过去除了有一点手工业之外，根本没有工业，更没有什么重工业。可是从去年全民大办工业、大搞钢铁运动以来，全州办工业的运动发展异常迅速，遍地开花，城镇农村，星罗棋布，仅州、县办的厂矿就有一百七十五个，人民公社办的厂矿二千八百多个。我们从来不知道钢铁是怎样炼的，从去年九月起不到四个月的时间中，就炼出了四千四百三十吨土钢，一万九千七百二十二吨铁。去年的工业总产值已达到八千多万元，占工农业总产值的百分之二十五，比第一个五年计划前一年的一九五二年，增长了二十六倍。自治州的交通运输事业也是一日千里地向前发展了，以吉首为中心的公路网、邮电网已经基本形成，现有通车的公路共九百二十八公里，比解放前的一百七十公里增加了四倍多；现有通航的河道共三千三百三十七公里，比解放前的五百五十七公里增加了五倍。现在，全州已经是县县通汽车了（解放前只有三个县通汽车，七个县不通），有一半以上的公社通了汽车。电话则是队队通到了。
    物质文化生活水平相应提高
    随着生产大跃进，全州各族人民的物质文化生活水平也相应地提高了。谁都知道，在反动的封建地主阶级统治的时代，绝大多数的少数民族地区的贫苦农民，都是过着非人的生活，真是所谓“镰刀挂上壁，家里没饭吃”，穷年累月地处于缺衣愁食、贫病交加的水深火热之中，许多人都是靠上山挖蕨采葛来维持生活。但是，现在的情况和过去已经有了天壤之别了。在一九五八年，全州的社会购买力平均每人已达四十点八九元，平均每人有粮已达八百九十一斤（其中口粮占六百斤以上）。在文化教育方面，全州小学生已达二十八万多人，百分之九十五以上的学龄儿童入了学，比解放前的一万五千多人增加了近二十倍；中学生三万一千零三十二人（包括民办一万四千八百六十九人）。比解放初的一千四百多人增加了二十多倍；而且破天荒第一次办起了一所各族人民自己的大学。在六十二万文盲和半文盲中，已有五十四万多人粗通文字。在医疗卫生方面，西医、中医院的病床已达三千一百零一张，比一九五二年增长近十倍，各种传染病的发病率大大减少，婴儿出生死亡率已降低到百分之零点二。
    这一切，说明了各族人民的生活和精神面貌起了多么显著的变化！我想向各位代表再介绍一下龙山县火岩山的情况：这个山绵延九十多里、拔海一千多公尺，解放前是个土匪出没之所。原来有一千五百户土家族、苗族杂居于此，由于被土匪掠夺残杀，灾荒贫病，人民群众不堪其苦，因此到解放时只剩下四百二十九户了。当时满山荆棘，遍野荒芜，狼虎成群，野猪结队。群众住的是岩洞，吃的是葛粑石蒜，冬天日里穿破蓑衣御寒，晚上烤团团火过夜。“有女莫嫁火岩山”，山下的姑娘，谁也不愿意嫁到山上去。但是，现在这个地方已经变成了一个如花似锦的社会主义乐园了。在去年，这个地方的粮食产量比解放时翻了二十一番；每户平均养猪七点七头、养鸡二十六只，农副业总产值平均每人达一百二十五元。小学、业余红专学校、托儿所、幼儿园、卫生所、俱乐部，都已经办起来了，适龄儿童全部入了学，百分之八十的青壮年去掉了文盲帽子，电话四通八达，广播响遍山林，人们再也不缺衣缺食了，姑娘们也愿意上山了。群众对于党和毛主席表示衷心的感谢和爱戴，他们说：“我们的命是共产党、毛主席救出来的，我们的幸福是合作化、公社化送来的。”他们热情地歌颂人民公社，有一首苗歌说：“红旗插到苗山岭，苗岭山摇水沸腾，人人歌唱公社好，犹如鲤鱼跳龙门”。
    曾经有人认为少数民族地区“落后”、“高山地区寒冷，农业不能高额丰产”、“文化技术落后，不能发展工业”等等，因而认为少数民族地区的社会主义建设只能缓进而不能跃进，这种论调，已经被雄辩的事实彻底粉碎了。
    在我们少数民族地区为什么能够取得这样巨大的跃进呢？正如周总理在“政府工作报告”中所指出的，由于完成了民主改革和基本上完成了社会主义改造，并且在这个基础上实现了人民公社化，有了一个能够适应生产发展需要的社会制度，周总理特别指出：“一九五八年大跃进的最重要的原因，是在于我们在一九五八年春季总结了第一个五年计划的经验，开始找到了我国建设社会主义的更好的方法，制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线”。我完全同意和拥护周总理在报告中的指示。
    继续努力，把自治州建成民族大团结的社会主义乐园
    当然，我们不能只是满足于一九五八年大跃进，我们在一九五九年还将要实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。根据“全国一盘棋”的方针，自治州制定了今年的生产计划，粮食产量将达到三十一亿多斤，比一九五八年增加百分之六十七；钢二千吨，比一九五八年增加近五倍；铁三万吨，比一九五八年增加近百分之五十。其它各项生产指标都有很大的增长。这个计划是跃进的，也是切实可靠的。我想只要切实做到以下几点，我们完全有把握完成一九五九年的计划：
    首先，必须加强党的领导，认真贯彻党的民族政策。党是我国各族人民利益的代表者和维护者，是团结和领导各族人民建设社会主义的核心力量，离开了党的领导或者削弱党的领导，就没有民族的繁荣和幸福，也就没有社会主义社会。
    其次，必须坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，在各个战线上开展两条道路的斗争，引导少数民族人民向社会主义的大路继续前进。
    第三，继续破除迷信，解放思想，大破少数民族地区“落后论”、“唯条件论”，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的风格和既要有冲天干劲、又要有科学分析的精神。
    第四，发展和巩固各民族之间的大团结、大支援，大协作，促进社会主义事业大发展。
    各位代表！在党的统一领导下，我相信我们一定能够完成和超额完成今年的计划，一定能够在不太遥远的将来，把我们自治州建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的民族大团结的社会主义乐园。我国各民族将更加团结一致地为建设社会主义和共产主义而共同奋斗。对于那些勾结帝国主义侵略势力、企图破坏祖国统一和民族团结的叛徒、败类，我们是绝对不能容忍的。最近原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的武装叛乱，已经遭到了全国各族人民的坚决反对。我们坚决拥护国务院关于平定西藏反动分子叛乱的命令。我们热烈祝贺平息西藏叛乱的伟大胜利，同时非常庆幸西藏人民现在已经有可能摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，实现民主自治和社会进步的愿望。我们相信，在全国各族人民的帮助下，西藏人民一定能把西藏高原建设成为真正的人间乐园。
