    Lhasa Pacification Diary
    After the Rain, a Clear Sky
    By Dan Chao, Propaganda Department of the CCP Tibet Work Committee
    March 10th (Tuesday)
      In Lhasa in March, you can't wear a leather coat anymore. In the morning, young men and women were doing radio exercises in just single-layer sweaters. At this time, the clock and loudspeaker on top of the Potala Palace would have been ringing for a long time, because the lamas were supposed to be chanting their morning scriptures. Today is very different. Many of the pedestrians coming and going are wearing plain clothes, and the shadows of Tibetan soldiers are appearing and disappearing.
    None of the comrades from the Tibet People's Broadcasting Station came to do morning exercises. When I went inside, I saw several comrades preparing a tape recorder.
    "What's happening today?"
    "The Dalai Lama is going to the military district auditorium to watch a song and dance performance. The comrades in the cultural troupe have been preparing for more than a month, so we're going to record some of their best programs. Aren't you going to take some photos? The Dalai Lama is sure to shake hands with the performers."
    I hurriedly went to prepare my camera. A sprinkler truck was already going back and forth in front of the Potala Palace to clean the road for the Dalai Lama's car. The sprinkler truck had gotten up early.
    We hurriedly ate breakfast and arrived at the military district auditorium. The auditorium was exceptionally clean and tidy. The Dalai Lama's seat was a velvet soft chair, and the receptionists had prepared various kinds of tea and snacks. The comrades in charge of welcoming people at the entrance of the auditorium were laughing and discussing which programs the Dalai Lama might ask to be performed again. In fact, the cultural troupe had already made preparations.
    It was almost eleven o'clock, and there was still no sign of his arrival. Many people were getting anxious and wanted to go and pick him up. Some comrades said that the Dalai Lama had just called and said that he would arrive on time and that there was no need to pick him up.
    Just as everyone was wondering, Wu Jin Ciren returned. He was a radio station technician, and whenever he came out to record, he always wanted to calibrate the time again. He ran up, covered in sweat, and said intermittently: "It's terrible, the Dalai Lama has been imprisoned in the Norbulingka by reactionary elements! They are now killing progressive people in the Norbulingka. The people outside the Norbulingka are running around in fright..."
    We hurried back to the work committee and saw a group of horsemen coming from the direction of the Norbulingka at the gate. They were dragging a bloody corpse on the horse's neck. Phagpalha Konchok was brutally murdered by the rebels with knives and stones. The people on the side of the road stood silently with their heads bowed, tears in their eyes. The rebels wanted to drag Phagpalha Konchok to the street to expose his body to the public.
    Barkhor Street, ah, Barkhor Street! The street where Princess Wencheng rode her horse when she married Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo in Lhasa has always been regarded as a sacred street by the Tibetan people. In front of the Jokhang Temple, Princess Wencheng lectured about various production and life styles and experiences of the motherland's interior. For this, the Tibetan people have composed many songs and dances to praise this place. But today, reactionary elements have spilled the blood of patriotic progressives all over the street, attempting to break up the friendship between the Tibetan and Han people! If Songtsen Gampo and Princess Wencheng could see this from underground, they would definitely come out and shout loudly to the masses, and use their swords to chop off these scum of the Tibetan people.
    My mind was racing when I heard someone behind me cocking a gun. I turned around and saw Awang Gesang pushing the submachine gun onto the chamber.
    "What are you doing?" I asked anxiously.
    "Can we let them be so arrogant? I'll give them a burst."
    "Do you have orders?"
    This comrade, who is usually very smiley, had a flushed face and looked particularly excited: "I'm willing to be punished, but I'm going to shoot!"
    I had a hard time pulling him back.
    I went back to my room and couldn't do anything. Through the window, I could clearly see the Potala Palace and the scenery on Yue Wang Mountain. The countless windows of the Potala Palace, the window sills that are usually full of pigeons, hide countless shiny gun muzzles. All kinds of rebels were crawling on the waist of Yue Wang Mountain. There were symbols of artillery activity on the top of the mountain, and many people were transporting ammunition and supplies up there...

    March 12th (Thursday)
    The situation is so tense these days, what are the citizens going to do so early? The morning mist still shrouds Lhasa, and groups of citizens are heading west with their heads drooping.
    Just as I was about to go out to inquire, Deji Zhuoga and Wu Jin Ciren were gesturing to some comrades about something. They both spoke in both Tibetan and Chinese, almost half of each language: "The rebels have issued an order that anyone who doesn't go to the Norbulingka to attend a meeting will be fined thirty taels of silver, and anyone who doesn't go will be killed. They also stipulated that Tibetan cadres and students must withdraw from the agencies and schools within three days, and those who violate this will be killed without pardon, and their families will not escape the butcher's knife. These guys are really hateful."
    "Have you heard any news about the Dalai Lama?" someone asked.
    "The Dalai Lama hasn't eaten or slept well these days; what's even more pitiful is that he doesn't even dare to sigh loudly..."
    The families of Tibetan cadres have been asking to move into the agencies. In less than a day, all the agencies were full. They said: Even if there are no houses to live in, we can live in the courtyard, as long as we are with the Communist Party, the sky won't fall on us.
    How can we let guests who don't usually come to stay live in the courtyard? We vacated the conference room, office, and dormitory to accommodate the guests.
    Shang Zhuma, a student at Lhasa Primary School, asked as soon as she moved in: "Does the Dalai Lama still have a place to sleep?"
    We suppressed our laughter and replied: "There is a place to sleep, but he can't leave the courtyard. The reactionary elements won't let him be free."

    March 15th (Sunday)
    The true colors of the bandits are even clearer. They are committing crimes everywhere in the city, as if imperialist invading forces have entered China.
    I heard that the nunnery in front of the Jokhang Temple is the worst. None of the dozens of young nuns have not been raped. The doors of many shops have been destroyed by the rebels, and good things have been looted. Reactionary nobles and officials are moving their homes to the Norbulingka in broad daylight, passing by the gate of the work committee.
    In the afternoon, pine resin was burned high in front of the Potala Palace. The reactionary elements are going to play new tricks. They have forced women to "attend meetings" again, and forced them to swear oaths to fight for driving away the Han people and defending Tibet's "independence."
    Reactionary noble women, like tigresses, climbed the steps of the monument. These monuments are symbols of the friendship and blood relationship between the Tibetan and Han people in various periods since the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. The Tibetan and Han characters on the stele record a large number of facts. But today, the reactionary nobles are standing on the stele platform and shouting that Tibet is an "independent country."
    In order to film this criminal situation, our photographers went to film with submachine guns on their backs. The reactionary nobles, who claimed to be upright, covered half of their faces with various colored headscarves when they saw the photographers, revealing only their sneaky eyes. Even so, they were made to look neither human nor ghostly in the camera.

    March 16th (Monday)
    Even the sun was angry and turned yellow, hiding its body behind a few thin clouds, as if it also hated the evil wind and demonic energy in the sky over Tibet. Although the light wasn't very good, we decided to go to the Norbulingka to see the situation. The rebels there were building combat fortifications.
    Three armored vehicles were dispatched. We sat in the middle armored vehicle, with smaller ones guarding the front and back.
    The armored vehicle went around behind the Potala Palace, so we could see the surrounding situation more clearly. Yaoxi Lingka to the east of the Potala Palace and Longwangtang to the north, which are the best places to play in the woods in summer, had some stern-looking guys working on fortifications. When they saw the armored vehicle passing by, they were so scared that they crawled motionless like dead dogs.
    Behind the Potala Palace, two old people carrying barley bags were walking in the same direction. They deliberately waited for the armored vehicle to get close, and then approached the armored vehicle together. Obviously, they were afraid of being seen by the rebels on the Potala Palace. The rebels would simply shoot them to death and then grab the bags, because this kind of thing happened often. The driver was very considerate of the Tibetan compatriots' feelings. He deliberately slowed down and escorted them all the way to the fork in the road in the northwest corner of the Potala Palace. The two Tibetan compatriots waved back to the armored vehicle from far away.
    From the Potala Palace to the west, there were no pedestrians on the road. The rebel positions were busy, and they were building large bunkers at the north gate of the Norbulingka. Why weren't there any fortifications? Did they want to fight on flat ground? But after careful observation, a long wall about one meter high was built on the side of the road, with many round holes in the middle. In each hole, there was a dark face watching us, and their buttocks were not completely covered by the bunker. It looked funny, but they also had certain ideas: For many years, the Communist Party has always been generous to them. They think that the People's Liberation Army is weak and incompetent, only knowing how to be beaten, but not daring to fight back.
    The photographer was from the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. The tall, dark, burly man was a Tibetan. He stretched his body to the top of the armored vehicle. We told him to stay lower to prevent snipers, but he said: "These soldiers wouldn't dare to move. They're already scared half to death when they see an armored vehicle." Sure enough, nothing happened for more than ten minutes of filming. When they saw the armored vehicle going back, they all stood up and watched with their guns in their arms.
    When we were discussing, the dark, burly man said: "The imperialists always have to make fools of themselves all over the world. This kind of soldier and this kind of fortification are the achievements of the British!"

    March 17th (Tuesday)
    The symbols of fighting are extremely obvious. The rebels are transferring manpower and ammunition day and night. We can't sit in the house and be beaten. These days, we have been repairing fortifications and making defenses day and night.
    The family members who came to the agencies, no matter what, didn't want to be idle and had to participate in the war preparation. They said: Are we not part of fighting against the scum of our own nation? The reactionary elements want to kill us, why can't we defend ourselves? They were not only actively preparing for war, but they had to get weapons.
    Small units farther away from the work committee and the military region reported how the rebels were besieging them, and how they were shooting and throwing stones into their courtyards, asking if they could fight back? But they only received the order to concentrate in the large agencies.

    March 18th (Wednesday)
    Today, a message suddenly came: The Dalai Lama is "missing." The upper-level reactionary group kidnapped the Dalai Lama out of Lhasa last night.
    Everyone listened and discussed a lot. A Tibetan cadre said: "When the Dalai Lama left the Norbulingka, he must have been constantly wiping his nose and tears secretly with a handkerchief; maybe Suokang and Liu Xia 'invited' him out with whips?"
    Citizens came to the work committee to complain, saying that the rebels were grabbing people everywhere to be "volunteers," and many who were unwilling were beaten to death on the spot.
    An old woman in her fifties was crying so hard that she couldn't speak clearly. The black woolen jacket on her chest was completely wet with tears, and it looked like she had been crying all night. Her hair was loose, her eyes were red and swollen, and her lips were trembling as she spoke. We poured her a glass of water and asked her to calm down. She said: "My family lives in the alley south of the Jokhang Temple. My son used to work as a handyman in the agency, and my daughter is a nun. Yesterday, they happened to go home to get zanba. I was afraid that they would meet bad people on the way back, so I asked them to stay and wait until tomorrow to leave. Who knew that not long after it got dark, a large group of reactionary elements opened the door and came in, beating and dragging my son away to be a 'volunteer.' What kind of volunteer is that? My daughter was so scared that she hid under the bed, but they dragged her out and raped her all night... I said she was a nun, please let her go! They said: 'Whether she's a nun or a stone nun, if it's meat, we'll eat it!' These beasts, how can the Buddha tolerate them!" We persuaded the old woman to take a sip of water and speak again, but she didn't stop for a breath, as if she wouldn't be satisfied until she bit the group of bandits. When we asked her to eat at the agency, she said: "My daughter is lying in bed crying and can't walk," she was anxious to help her, and we gave her some rice to take with her.

    March 19th (Thursday)
    After breakfast, I went to the bookstore to find some materials and found that new residents had been added near the work committee. They put up a simple yak hair tent, put a few rolls of broken felt strips inside, and next to the tin stove were yak dung and zanba bags. Obviously, they weren't planning to live there for a long time. The hosts weren't strangers. Some were vegetable sellers, some were stall vendors, and some were selling beef and mutton. When they saw me, a rare guest, they asked me to sit on the felt strips. I asked the old woman holding a little boy: "Why did you move here?"
    "What are you talking about," the old woman said strangely: "Can people still live on the street? Evil rabbits and wild wolves are running all over the street. The good things at home have already been looted by them. I don't want to be killed by them while keeping my old life. I want to live to see how many days these demons can be domineering!"
    "There's going to be a war soon, aren't you afraid to live here?" I asked further.
    "This is the residence of the work committee, can they attack the work committee here? I don't believe a vole can turn into a lion."
    The old woman's words left a deep impression on me. The Tibetan people after liberation are no longer Tibetan compatriots under the control of imperialism. With such Tibetan compatriots, what can we not do well? I kissed her little grandson and casually put down a few fruit candies.
    In the evening, the communications team of the militia regiment arrived. The jeep stopped with a gust of dust, and then sped away in a cloud of smoke.
    Some of the more astute comrades knew without asking, and they automatically wiped their guns and bullets again. I followed their example and unscrewed the grenade cover and placed it next to my pillow. The problems estimated by the leadership rarely deviate greatly. Either tonight or tomorrow night, the rebels are going to launch a large-scale armed attack on us.
    I went to the radio station's residence to take a look, wanting to test their reaction. If they hadn't noticed yet, I could tell them about this very possible situation.
    The announcer Deji Zhuoga was preparing zanba bags and dried beef, as well as oil fruits and other things.
    "Where are you going, are you moving?"
    "This is my dry food when I fight. I can see that it won't take more than three days, what do you say?"
    "Is this enough to eat?"
    "Hey! Do you want to fight for a month? Two days' worth of dry food is more than enough, if you don't believe me, let's make a bet."
    In the evening, I felt even better, and I didn't feel sleepy at all. I deliberately picked out some more manuscripts, preparing to stay up all night, so I wouldn't have to find shoes and socks temporarily when the fighting started. These few books are the first literary tribute to the Party in the Tibetan region. Maybe you will be born in the sound of artillery fire, and the manuscript will also have the smell of gunpowder!

    March 20th (Friday)
    It was already the second half of the night, and the weather was a little cool. I put on my coat and went to the courtyard to get some air, planning to come back and continue selecting manuscripts.
    Just as I arrived in the courtyard, I suddenly saw flames spewing out everywhere from the Norbulingka, Yue Wang Mountain, and the Potala Palace. Immediately, the entire city was filled with gunfire. I looked at my watch, it was exactly 3:40. The reactionary group in Tibet has finally torn off its mask and chosen the path of self-destruction.
    Everyone got up and listened quietly to the sound of artillery. People gathered in the bunker, which was used for both defense and as a broadcasting studio. The announcer Deji Zhuoga kept asking others, but every time she asked, no one could answer her satisfactorily. She asked: "Why don't we fight back? Are our artillerymen all asleep?"
    "It's not time to fire yet." Someone answered, but he didn't agree with his own words.
    "When is it time? I think it's time already."
    "Ama la," Deji Zhuoga's five-year-old son said: "Shu Ge Mai Jue Ren? (Whose cannon?) Jin Zhu Ma Mi Ren Bai (Is it the People's Liberation Army's?)"
    "Go to sleep, what do you know!" She was a little angry with her child.
    Everyone didn't sleep and sat until dawn.
    The sun dressed up Lhasa's green branches and leaves especially beautifully. This was a good opportunity for a spring outing, but our anxious mood was not because we were eager to play in the woods, but we were waiting for the moment when the artillery would fire back.
    At ten o'clock in the morning, our troops began to counterattack. The artillery showed its power, and the hearts of everyone in Lhasa were excited. The people in the agency, even the family members, carried their babies and ran to the courtyard to watch. They had to be pulled back to the bunker. Deji Zhuoga's spirits rose sharply, and the sound of the loudspeaker became even louder. The sound of gunfire was mixed with the sound of the loudspeaker, forming a rare "symphony."
    The lookout point can overlook the entire city. I only saw chaos on the rebel positions. The officers couldn't control the soldiers. The soldiers who usually bent over, stuck out their tongues, and lowered their heads to speak to the officers also changed their routine. No matter how angry the officers were, they still found safe places to hide. People stood watching our army's counterattack in the windows of the streets. Every time a shell exploded on the rebel positions, some people jumped up happily and clapped their hands, and also made gestures of speaking loudly. A young woman even held her two or three-year-old son up to the window. They had been waiting for this moment for a long time.
    Not only were the Tibetan, Hui, and Han cadres in the agency busy; the family members were also busy. They automatically sent butter tea pots to the front lines, helped the kitchen boil water and cook rice, and sent dry food to the comrades. This "logistics" force was all smiles, as if they were celebrating a happy event.
    Tibetan and Hui cadres constantly demanded to go on the attack. They wanted to organize a commando team, for a simple reason: It would be convenient to shout out and capture some of the key members they knew.
    In fact, there was no need to worry. After three o'clock in the afternoon, the five-star red flag was raised on Yue Wang Mountain, and the Potala Palace and the Jokhang Temple, which were less than a hundred meters away, were under control.

    March 21st (Saturday)
    The comrades who went to the Norbulingka came back and said: "There wasn't much destruction there. Our shells all hit the fortifications in front of the wall, they were really sharpshooters. The rebels damaged some corners and walls when they resisted stubbornly. They dug gun holes in the walls."
    I was worried about whether the gardens and fruit trees in the Norbulingka were damaged, and what about the peacocks, monkeys, wild horses, and fish ponds? This is the time when buds are about to bloom and fish and animals are walking around! In fact, they were only frightened.
    The artillery was pointing at the Potala Palace. We only saw the shells exploding on the bunkers at the foot of the palace. What was going on? Was it not accurate? Why didn't a single shell miss its target when hitting Yue Wang Mountain? It turned out that the artillery had received orders: They were not allowed to bombard the top of the Potala Palace and the Jokhang Temple, and were only allowed to hit secondary places that would not damage the buildings. The Tibetan and Hui cadres in the agency were surprised and said: Is there such a humane and polite way of fighting in the world!

    March 22nd (Sunday)
    The humanistic spirit and particularly polite way of fighting of our army played a great role in the disintegration of the rebels.
    It wasn't even breakfast time yet when someone shouted to gather quickly. You don't need to gather to eat! It turned out that everyone was being called to accept prisoners.
    The remaining rebels in the Potala Palace and the Jokhang Temple came over in lines one after another. In the prisoner team, there were sixty-eight-year-old men and fourteen-year-old children. This little child, named Pingtso, lived in the northern part of the city. He was captured three days before the war. At that time, he was grazing sheep. The rebels drove the sheep away and dragged him away to be their soldier. We wiped away his tears and stuffed some steamed buns into his arms. He smiled and ran home.
    The soldier who brought the prisoners told us a story from last night while eating a steamed bun: In the middle of the night, he was really hungry, so he knocked on the door of a sesame cake shop. He originally thought that this was just a chance, a mirage to quench his thirst. Unexpectedly, someone inside asked him. After he said "Jin Zhu Ma Mi Sha Ma Sha" (People's Liberation Army), five dry, hard sesame cakes were handed out through the crack in the door, and he stuffed in a silver dollar. Saying this, he took out the remaining one, saying that he wanted everyone to see it.
    Those who heard it couldn't help but discuss: "The upper-level reactionary group keeps saying that the Tibetans want to drive away the Han people. What kind of Tibetans are these? Probably other than the reactionary nobles, they are the running dogs of imperialism!"
    In the afternoon, there was no sound of artillery in Lhasa, but a few remaining rebels were still hiding in the homes of ordinary people and firing cold shots.
    Among a group of captured upper-level reactionary elements, I saw Mu Xia Daiben. When the army marched into Chamdo in 1950, he personally commanded machine guns to ambush us on the Jinsha River, killing many of our cavalrymen. Later, he stubbornly resisted in the city of Chamdo. After being captured in Chamdo, we treated him very well, taking special care of his food and accommodation. Later, he became a Daiben (regimental commander) again, but he did not correct his evil ways. This time, he was taken prisoner again.

    March 23rd (Monday)
    In the morning, we went to the streets to collect materials and first arrived at the Jokhang Temple. The entire temple, especially the one with the golden roof, can be said to be intact. In order to avoid the reactionary elements from carrying out sabotage, we guarded it as soon as the enemy surrendered.
    The large willow tree at the west gate of the Jokhang Temple has sprouted quite a bit. This tree was planted when Princess Wencheng married Tibet, so people have always called it "Tang Willow." Tang Willow, ah, Tang Willow, when you were first planted, how close and harmonious the Tibetan and Han nationalities were in the big family of the motherland. Over the years, how many imperialist agents and bad guys have made you look thin and damaged, how many upper-level reactionary elements have defiled your body, you have gone through many storms, but you have persevered, aren't you even more beautiful? Just like the friendship and unity of the Tibetan and Han nationalities, because the roots are growing on the sacred and inviolable land of the motherland, how can the warm sunshine of the motherland not make you grow healthily?
    There are already pedestrians everywhere on the street. I don't know who started it, but everyone is holding a clean white Hada, and when they see us, they raise it high and say: "Tashi Delek, Tashi Delek!" These auspicious words, which are usually not said, have simply become the opening remarks between people. That smiling look on their faces can only be found on the faces of people who have endless joy in their hearts.
    I met an old woman who was carrying a big bag. When she came to us, she smiled and opened it: rice, zanba, tea, butter, almost everything, and a few newer clothes. I asked what was going on? She said: "We have been hoarding things a few days before the war. You know that the reactionary elements are capable of all kinds of evil. I was worried about hiding these things in the east and west. Later, I suddenly thought, why not send them to the agency? So I took them to my nephew's house who works in the construction engineering department. Now it's good, I can take them home with peace of mind."
    "Lhasa will never fight again, just live your life with peace of mind!" We helped her pack up the bag of things.
    The old woman said: "I knew these beasts wouldn't last long, otherwise, wouldn't the sun have to come out from the west?"

    拉萨平乱两周日记
    雨过天青
    中共西藏工委宣传部　单超
    3月10日　（星期二）
      阳历3月的拉萨，已经穿不住皮大衣了。早晨，小伙子大姑娘们，简直只穿着单毛线衣在作广播操。在往常这个时候，对面的布达拉宫顶上，早已响起了当当的钟声和长筒子喇叭声，因为喇嘛该念晨经了。今天大不相同，上面来来往往的行人，有不少是穿便衣的，藏军的影子也时隐时现。
    西藏人民广播电台的同志，没有一个人来作早操，我进屋一看，几个同志正准备录音机。
    “今天又有什么活动？”
    “达赖喇嘛到军区大礼堂看歌舞，文工团的同志准备一个多月了，去录些拿手的节目。你不去拍几张照片吗？达赖一定要给演员们握手。”
    我急忙去准备照像机，洒水车已经在布达拉宫前面来往洒水了，为了达赖的汽车在干净的路上行驶，洒水车起了个大清早。
    我们匆忙地吃过早饭，赶到军区礼堂以后，礼堂里分外清净整洁，达赖喇嘛的座位是绒布软椅，招待员准备了各色的茶点，演员们早已化好了装，在礼堂门口负责迎接的负责同志，说笑着、议论着达赖喇嘛可能叫重演的几个节目，其实文工团早已作了准备。
    快十一点了，还不见有来的象征，不少人发急了，要去车接一接，有的同志说，达赖喇嘛刚才打电话来还说，他会按时来的，用不着去接。
    大家正在纳闷，五金慈仁回来了。他是电台机务员，每逢出来录音，他总想把时间再次校准一些。他跑的满头大汗，断断续续地说：“不得了啦，达赖喇嘛被反动分子囚禁在罗布林卡了，现在正在罗布林卡杀害进步人士，林卡外边的老百姓吓的乱跑……。”
    我们急忙赶回工委，在大门口看见从罗布林卡方向过来一批马队，马脖子上拉着个鲜血淋淋的死尸，帕巴拉堪穹被叛匪用刀子和石头残杀了。路旁的老百姓，含着泪低着头默默地站着。叛匪要把帕巴拉堪穹拉到大街上暴尸示众。
    八角街啊八角街！文成公主到拉萨和藏王松赞干布结婚时跨马扬光的八角街，是一直被藏族人民称为圣洁的大街；大昭寺的门前，是文成公主讲演过祖国内地各种生产生活方式和经验的宝地，为了这，西藏人民编过多少歌舞来诵扬过这个地方。而今天，反动分子把爱国进步人士的鲜血洒满全街，企图冲散藏汉人民的友谊！假若松赞干布和文成公主在地底下能看到的话，一定会出来向群众大声疾呼，用宝剑斩除这些藏族的败类。
    我的脑子正在翻腾，听见后面有人扳动枪机，回头一看，阿旺格桑正把冲锋枪推上膛。
    “干什么？”我急着问。
    “能让他们这样狂妄吗？ 我给他们一梭子。”
    “有命令吗？”
    这个平时非常爱笑的同志，脸涨的通红，显得分外激动：“我情愿受处分也要打！”
    我费好大劲才把他拉回来。
    我回到屋里，什么事情也干不下去了，透过窗户，用望远镜可以清楚的看见布达拉宫和岳王山上的情景。布达拉里数不清的窗户上，平时站满鸽子的窗台上，隐藏着数不清的发亮的枪口，岳王山腰里，爬伏着形形色色的叛匪，山顶上有炮兵的活动象征，不少人往上运送弹药和给养……
    3月12日　（星期四）
    这两天的情况那样紧张，市民们这样早去干什么？晨雾还笼罩着拉萨城，三五成群的市民，垂头丧气的往西边走去。
    才想出去打听一下，得及卓噶和五金慈仁他们正给一些同志比手划脚的说什么。她两个都是用藏汉两种话一齐说，几乎是每样话各占一半：“叛匪下了命令，谁不到罗布林卡开会，罚银子三十两，再不去的就杀头；还规定藏族干部和学生一律在三天内退出机关学校，违者格杀勿论，家属也难逃屠刀；这些家伙真是可恶极了。”
    “听到达赖的什么消息了吗？”有人问。
    “达赖这几天都没吃好饭，也没睡好觉；更可怜的是连大声叹气也不敢……。”
    藏族干部们的家属纷纷要求搬到机关里来，不到一天功夫，各机关里都住满了，他们说：没有房子住在院子里也可以，只要和共产党在一起，天塌下来也压不着。
    怎能让不常来住的客人住到院子里面呢？我们把会议室，办公室以及宿舍腾出来，安置了客人。
    上珠玛是拉萨小学的学生，刚住下来就问：“达赖喇嘛还有地方睡觉没有？”
    我们忍住笑回答：“睡觉的地方是有的，就是出不了院子，反动分子不让他自由了。”
    3月15日（星期日）
    土匪的面目更清楚了，在城里到处行凶作恶。好像帝国主义侵略军队打到中国一样。
    听说大昭寺前面的尼姑庙里搞的最凶，几十个年青尼姑没有一个不被强奸的。不少商店的门被叛匪捣毁，好东西抢掠一空。反动贵族和官员，大白天经过工委门口往罗布林卡搬家。
    下午，布达拉前面松香高烧。反动分子又要出新花样。他们又把妇女逼去“开会”，硬要她们赌咒罚誓，为赶走汉人保卫西藏“独立”而斗争。
    反动贵族妇女，像母老虎一样，登上纪念碑的台阶，这些纪念碑，是唐宋元明清以来，各个时期藏汉族人民友谊和血肉关系的象征，碑上的藏汉两种文字，记载了大量事实。而今天，反动贵族竟然站在碑台上高喊西藏是个“独立国”了。
    为了拍下这个罪恶的情况，我们的摄影师们，背上冲锋枪去拍电影。自称是光明正大的反动贵族们，见摄影师去，纷纷用各色包头巾把半个脸盖起来，只露出贼溜溜的两只眼睛。虽然如此，也让她人不人鬼不鬼的进入了镜头。
    3月16日（星期一）
    连太阳也气的黄了脸，用几片薄云掩护着身体，好像她也十分厌恶西藏上空的一股妖风邪气。虽然光线不十分好，我们还是决定到罗布林卡去看看情况，那里的叛匪正在修筑作战工事。
    三辆装甲车出动了，我们坐在中间的大装甲车上，前后还有小的保卫。
    装甲车绕到布达拉后面过去，这样我们就可以把附近情况看的更清楚一些。布达拉东面的尧西林卡和北面的龙王塘，本来是夏天玩林卡最好的地方，都有些横眉竖眼的家伙在搞工事。见装甲车经过，都吓的像死狗一样爬着不动。
    在布达拉的背后，有两个背青稞口袋的老百姓往同一方向走，他们有意等装甲车走近，然后靠近装甲车一块去，显然是怕布达拉上面的叛匪看见，叛匪简直会一枪把他们打死，然后把口袋抢跑，因为这种事是常有的。驾驶员很会体贴藏胞的心情，他故意把速度放慢，一直护送到布达拉西北角的路岔上，那两个藏胞老远还回头给装甲车招手。
    从布达拉往西，路上没见行人，叛匪阵地上倒是忙忙乱乱，他们正在罗布林卡北门口修大地堡。怎么不见什么工事呢？难道他们要在平地上打仗吗？但仔细一观察，就在公路边上，修了一长道一公尺左右的小墙头，中间有不少圆洞，每洞里都有乌黑的脸形看我们，屁股还没完全被掩体遮住，看起来似乎好笑，但他们也有一定的想法：多少年来，共产党总是对他们宽宏大量，他们认为解放军软弱无能，只会挨打，不敢还手。
    摄影师是中央新闻纪录电影制片厂来的，高个子黑大汉是个藏族，他把身子伸到装甲车顶上去，我们叫他矮一点，防备打冷枪，他却说：“这些兵还敢动一下，见了装甲车早吓死了半截。”果然，拍了十几分钟，倒是平安无事。他们见装甲车回去了，都站起来大抱着枪观看。
    我们几个谈论起来，黑大汉说：“帝国主义总要在世界各地把洋相出完，这样的兵，这样的工事，还是英国人培养出来的成绩呢？”
    3月17日　（星期二）
    打仗的象征极为明显了，叛匪日夜调人马运弹药，我们不能坐在屋子里挨打，这几天来，总是日夜不停的修工事作防御。
    到机关来的家属，无论如何也不愿意闲着，非参加备战不可，他们说：打我们自己民族的败类，难道没有我们的一份吗？反动分子要杀我们，我们为什么不能自卫呢？他们不但积极作备战工作，一定要拿到武器才罢休。
    离工委和军区远些的小单位，纷纷报告叛匪怎样围攻他们，怎样往他们院里打枪摔石头，问能不能还击？但他们只得到了往大机关里集中的命令。
    3月18日　（星期三）
    今天忽然传来一个消息：达赖“失踪”了。上层反动集团，在昨天晚上把达赖喇嘛劫持出了拉萨。
    大家听了，议论纷纷。一位藏族干部说：“达赖喇嘛离开罗布林卡时，一定是不断用手帕偷偷拭擦鼻涕和眼泪；说不定索康、柳霞他们，是用皮鞭‘请’他出门的呢？
    市民纷纷到工委来诉苦，说叛匪到处抓人去当“志愿军”，不愿去的当场打死不少。
    一位五十多岁的老太太，哭的已经说不清话了，她胸前的黑氆氇夹衣，全部被泪水打湿了，看起来昨晚一定哭了一整夜。她头发松散，两眼发红而肿大，说话时嘴唇不停发抖，我们给她倒上一杯水，请她定定神，她说：“我家就住在大昭寺南边的小巷子里，儿子在机关里当过小工，女儿是个尼姑，昨天他们可巧都回家来取粘粑，我怕他们回去路上碰见坏人，就叫他们住下来等明天走。谁知天才黑不久，一大群反动分子打开门进来了，把我儿子连打带拉拉走当“志愿军”去了，那叫什么志愿军呢？我女儿吓的藏在床底下，被他们拉出轮奸了一整夜……我说她是尼姑，请您放了她吧！他们说：‘不管是尼姑还是石姑，是肉就要吃！’这群野兽，佛爷怎么能容他们啊！”我们劝老太太喝口水再说，可是她一口气也不歇，好像非要把那群土匪咬上一口才甘心。我们留她在机关吃饭时，她又说：“女儿躺在床正哭叫，不能走路了”，她急着扶侍她，我们给带上了一些大米。
    3月19日　（星期四）
    早饭后，我到书店去找些材料发现工委附近新增加了住户，他们搭了个简单的牛毛帐篷，里面放上几卷破毡条，洋铁炉子旁是牛粪和粘粑口袋，显然并不是长住的作法。主人们并不面生，有的是卖小菜的，有的是摆小摊子的，有的是卖牛羊肉的。他们见了我这个稀客，让我坐在毡条上。我问抱着个小男孩的老大娘：“怎么搬到这里来了？”
    “看你说的，”老大娘很奇怪：“街上还能住人吗，恶兔野狼满街串，家里的好东西早叫他们抢光了，留着我这个老命还不想叫他们杀死，我要活着看看这些恶魔能霸道几天！”
    “快打仗啦，住在这里不害怕？”我进一步问。
    “这是工委的住地，难道他们能打到工委这里来？我就不信獭狗能变成狮子。”
    老大娘的话给我很深的印象。解放后的藏族人民，不是帝国主义把持下的藏胞了，有了这样的藏胞，我们什么事情还办不好呢？我亲了亲她的小孙子，随手放下几个水果糖。
    傍晚，民兵团的通讯组来了，吉普车带着一阵尘土停下，又卷起一阵浓烟急驰而去。
    敏锐一些的同志不问便知，他们自动又把枪械子弹擦拭一番，我也学着他们的样子，把手榴弹盖拧开，放在枕头旁边。领导上估计的问题是很少有大的偏差的，不是今晚就是明天夜里，叛匪要大举武装进攻我们。
    我到电台住地去转了一下，想试探下他们的动静，要是他们还没觉察到，我好转告一下这个非常的可能。
    播音员德及卓噶正在准备粘粑口袋和干牛肉，还有油果子一类的东西。
    “往那里去，要搬房子吗！”
    “这就是我打仗时的干粮，我看出不了三天了，你说怎么样？”
    “这一点够吃的吗？”
    “嘿！你还想打一个月吗，两天的干粮就满够了，要不信咱们打个赌。”
    晚上，精神更好了，简直没有一点睡意。我有意多挑了些稿件，准备熬个通宵，省的打起来临时找鞋摸袜子的。这几本啊，是西藏地区第一次给党的文艺献礼，说不定你要在炮火声中初步诞生，稿上还要附有火药味呢！
    3月20日　（星期五）
    已经是下半夜了，天气有点凉起来，我把大衣披上去院内透透空气，打算回来接着挑选稿子。
    刚到院中，忽然看见罗布林卡、岳王山、布达拉宫上，到处有火光喷出，立刻全城都响起了枪炮声。我看了看表，正是三点四十分。西藏的反动集团，终于撕破了自己的假面具，而且自己选择了自取灭亡的道路了。
    大家都起来了，静听着炮声。人们都集聚在地堡里，这地堡是两用的，是阵地，又是播音室。播音员德及卓噶不停地问别人，然而每次问都没人能答的他满意。她问：“我们为什么老是不还击？我们的炮兵都睡着了吗？”
    “不开炮是不到时候。”有人回答了自己也不同意的话。
    “什么时候是到时候？我看早就到时候了。”
    “阿妈啦”，德及卓噶五岁的儿子发言了：“孰格麦绝忍？（谁的大炮）金珠玛米忍白（是解放军的吗？）”
    “睡你的吧，你知道个屁！”她对孩子有点发脾气了。
    大家全都没有睡，直坐到天亮。
    太阳把拉萨的青枝绿叶打扮的分外美丽，这正是春游的良机，但我们焦急的心情，不是因为急着去玩林卡，却在等待炮兵还炮的时刻。
    上午十时正，我们的军队开始反击了。大炮发着威力，全拉萨的人心都激动起来了。机关的人，连家属也抱着小娃跑到院里去看，非得拉她们才肯到地堡里去。德及卓噶的精神陡增，喇叭的声音也就更加洪亮了。枪炮声夹杂着喇叭声，组成了少有的“交响乐曲”。
    了望所可以俯瞰全城。只看到叛匪阵上一片忙乱，官长也管不住士兵了。平时弯腰伸舌低着头才敢给官长说话的士兵，也改变了常规，不管官长怎样发怒，他们还是找保险的地方去躲藏。街上的大小窗口里，都有人站着看我军反击，每一排炮弹在叛匪阵地上爆炸，都有些人高兴的跳起来拍手，还作出高声说话的样子。一位年轻的妇女，还把两三岁的儿子举到窗口上去。他们早就等待这种时辰了。
    不光是机关里藏回汉族干部忙；家属也忙起来了，她们自动把酥油茶壶送到阵地上去，帮助伙房烧水煮饭，给同志们送干粮。这支“后勤”部队，个个喜笑颜开，简直是在办喜事。
    藏回族干部不断的要求出击，他们要组织个突击小组，理由很简单：出去便利喊话，多抓些他们认识的骨干分子回来。
    其实不用着急，下午三点多，岳王山上就升起了五星红旗，控制了近在百公尺的布达拉，鸟视罗布林卡大昭寺了。
    3月21日　（星期六）
    到罗布林卡去的同志回来说：“那里并没有什么破坏，我们的炮弹都打在墙根前的工事上，真是神炮手；叛匪顽抗时倒搞坏了一些房角和墙壁，他们在墙上挖枪眼。”
    我耽心罗布林卡里的花园和果树是不是坏了，那些孔雀、猿猴、野马、鱼塘等又怎么样？这时正是含苞待放、鱼游兽走的时候啊！其实，它们不过受了些惊吓而已。
    炮兵指向布达拉，我们只见炮弹在宫脚下暗堡上爆炸，是怎么回事呢？打不准吗？为什么打岳王山时，没有一个炮弹不落在目标上。原来是炮兵早接了命令：不准炮击布达拉和大昭寺的上面，只准打不破坏建筑物的次要地方。机关的藏回族干部都惊奇地说：世界上还有这样人道和客气的打仗的啊！
    3月22日　（星期日）
    我军的人道主义精神和特别客气的打法，对叛匪的瓦解起了很大作用。
    还不到早饭时间，有人喊叫快集合，开饭也不必集合啊！原来是叫大家都去接受俘虏。
    布达拉和大昭寺的残匪，先后排着队过来了。在俘虏队里，有六十八岁的老头子，有十四岁的小孩子。这个小孩子叫平措，住在城北部下，是打仗前三天被抓去的，当时他正在放羊，叛匪把羊赶跑了，连他也一同拉去当了他们的兵。我们替他擦了擦泪水，往他怀里装了些馒头，他笑着跑回家去了。
    带俘虏来的那个战士，一边吃馒头一边告诉我们昨天晚上的一段故事：半夜三更，实在饿慌了，他拍拍烧饼铺的门，原先想着，这不过是碰运气，望梅止渴。不料里面却问起他来，他说是“金珠玛米沙玛沙”（解放军）以后，门缝里就递来五个干硬的小烧饼，他就塞进去一个银元。说到这里，他摸出了剩下的一个，说是要叫大家都看看。
    听到的人不禁议论起来：“上层反动集团口口声声说是藏人要赶走汉人。这些藏人到底是什么样的藏人呢？大概除了反动贵族，就是帝国主义的走狗吧！”
    下午，拉萨的炮声是没有了，但少数的残匪，还藏在老百姓家里打冷枪。
    在一群被俘的上层反动分子中，我看见了木霞代本。1950年进军昌都时，在金沙江边，他亲自指挥机枪打埋伏，打死了我们不少骑兵，后来又在昌都城里进行顽抗。在昌都被俘后，我们对他十分宽待，吃住都特别照顾。后来他又当了代本（团长），并没有改邪归正。这次，他又当了俘虏。
    3月23日（星期一）
    早晨，我们到街上去搜集材料，首先到了大昭寺。整个寺院，特别是有金顶的，可以说是完整无缺，为了避免反动分子进行破坏，敌人一投降我们就看管起来了。
    大昭寺西门口的大柳树，已经抽芽好长了。这棵树，是文成公主下嫁西藏时栽的，所以人们一直称它是“唐柳”，唐柳啊唐柳，当初栽下你的时候，藏汉民族是多么的亲密和睦的团结在祖国大家庭里，这些年来，有多少帝国主义的特务和坏蛋，曾经使你容颜瘦损，有多少上层反动分子玷污过你的躯体，你经过多少狂风暴雨，但你坚持下来了，你不是更加美丽了吗？正像藏汉民族的友谊和团结一样，因为根是生长在祖国神圣不可侵犯的土地上，祖国温暖的阳光，怎能不使你健康的生长？
    街上已经到处有行人了，也不知是谁发起的，每个人都拿着条洁白的哈达，见了我们就举得高高的说：“扎喜得勒，扎喜得勒！”这些一般时候不说的吉庆话，简直成了人们见面之间的开场白了。他们脸上那种笑咪咪的样子，只有在内心有着说不尽的乐味的人脸上才能找到。
    我碰见一位老大娘，她提了个大包包。到我们面前，就笑着打开了：大米、粘粑、茶叶、酥油，简直样样俱全，还有几件新些的衣服。我问这是怎么回事？她说：“离打仗几天我们就生法藏东西，你是知道反动分子无恶不作的，我把这些东西，东躲也不放心，西藏也不放心，后来我才一下子想起来，为什么不送到机关里去呢？就拿到在建筑工程处当工人的我的侄子家去了，现在好了，我可以安心地拿回家去了。”
    “拉萨永远也不会再打仗了，您只管放心的过日子吧！”我们帮她把那包东西收拾起来。
    老太太说：“我早知道这些野兽长不了，要不，太阳不是就要从西边出来了吗？”
