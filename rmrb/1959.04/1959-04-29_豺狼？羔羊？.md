In recent days, Indian expansionists, amidst the clamor of the so-called "Chinese threat to India," are stepping up their efforts to incite a fanatical anti-China movement.

Please read the pronouncements of these distinguished gentlemen. On April 25th, Frank Moraes, editor-in-chief of the Indian Express system, wrote in sensational terms: India is facing an "aggressive China," and India is at the top of the list of countries China wants to "liberate." He hysterically shouted: "Now that Peking is at our doorstep, the danger is even closer and more urgent." Prior to this, on April 23rd, the "New India Times" also published a commentary calling on India to "thoroughly understand China's strategy," and pretended to be surprised, saying that "given the opportunity, China will not hesitate to strike a blow against India!"

It is not difficult for anyone to discover how similar these remarks are to the clichés used by imperialists to slander the Chinese people! Indian expansionists are actually borrowing propaganda weapons from the imperialists. This is another malignant development in their anti-China movement. It seems that these expansionists do not intend to restrain themselves or calm down at the moment.

May I ask the Indian expansionists, who exactly is threatening whom? The Chinese people have never invaded India or interfered in India's internal affairs. Tibet is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people are suppressing the rebellion in Tibet. How can this "threaten" India? However, Indian expansionists began to eagerly interfere in China's internal affairs long before the Tibetan rebellion occurred. After the rebellion broke out, they even more unscrupulously used all their newspapers to slander the Chinese people, organize various gatherings and institutions of all kinds to support the rebels and attack China. Although the Chinese people, valuing Sino-Indian friendship and with tolerance in mind, have adopted the greatest possible restraint, nevertheless, "the tree desires calm, but the wind will not cease." The Indian expansionists actually thought that the Chinese people could be deceived and became even more presumptuous. They openly revealed their wolfish nature, using the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" to demand "Tibetan independence," and gathered so-called "demonstrators" to make trouble in front of our consulate, even to the point of viciously insulting our people's leader. Isn't this going too far!

The excessive words and deeds of Indian expansionists have aroused the righteous indignation of the broad masses of the Chinese people. When we had no choice but to rise up in self-defense and begin to counterattack the interventionists, they pretended to be innocent lambs again. An editorial in India's "Free Press" on April 24th said, "China may think India's wise restraint is a sign of weakness." What "wise restraint"! Since the Tibetan rebellion, hasn't your presumptuous slander, defamation, and insults against the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and even the head of state been enough? If this is not "restraint," then what would it be? Do you still intend to send troops to Tibet? It is true that in 1886-1888 and 1904, British imperialism launched two military invasions against Tibet, but both ended in failure. It is expected that you cannot and dare not go down this old road again. Now, the Tibetan rebellion has been basically quelled. The Tibetan people warmly support the central government and the People's Liberation Army, and are moving towards a new life in the great family of the motherland. The Indian expansionists are shouting loudly that China is "invading" India and "threatening" India, nothing more than wanting to use rumors to incite the Indian people's hatred of China and sow discord between the people of China and India. Dear sirs, it can be predicted that your shady plots, which cannot see the light of day, will certainly suffer an even more shameful defeat.

The Chinese people have repeatedly stated that we have always valued Sino-Indian friendship. However, we want to sincerely advise you: your attitude should be more honest, neither acting like a wolf, nor needing to pretend to be an innocent lamb.

    豺狼？羔羊？
    崔奇
    近日来，印度扩张主义分子正在所谓“中国威胁印度”的喧嚣声中，加紧地煽动狂热的反华运动。
    请读一下这些大人先生的言论吧。4月25日，印度快报系统的总编辑弗兰克·莫雷斯以耸人听闻的词汇写道：印度正面对一个“侵略的中国”，印度是被列在中国要“解放”的国家名单的前面。他歇斯底里地叫道：“现在北平到了我们的大门口，危险就更加接近和紧急了”。而在此以前，4月23日，“新印度时报”也发表评论，要求印度“彻底了解中国的策略”，并且故作惊人之态，说什么“只要有机会，中国就将毫不犹豫地对印度下毒手”！
    任何人都不难发现，这些言论同帝国主义者诬蔑中国人民的滥调是多么相似啊！印度扩张主义分子居然向帝国主义者借用宣传武器了。这是他们在反华运动中的又一个恶性发展。看来这些扩张主义分子现在还不打算有所收敛，冷静下来。
    试问印度的扩张主义分子们，究竟是谁威胁了谁呢？中国人民从来没有侵犯过印度，从来没有干涉过印度的内政。西藏是中国领土，中国人民在西藏平定叛乱，怎么会“威胁”印度呢？可是，印度扩张主义分子却远在西藏叛乱发生之前，就开始热衷于干涉中国的内政了。在叛乱发生之后，他们更肆无忌惮地利用他们所有的报刊，诽谤中国人民，组织各种各样集会和形形色色的机构支持叛乱分子，攻击中国。尽管中国人民以中印友谊为重，以容忍为怀，采取了最大限度的克制态度，然而，“树欲静而风不止”，印度扩张主义分子竟以为中国人民可欺，更加放肆起来，他们公然露出了豺狼的本相，利用所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，要求“西藏独立”，并且纠集所谓“示威者”到我国领事馆门前闹事，直到恶毒地侮辱我国人民的领袖。这不是欺人太甚吗！
    印度扩张主义分子的过分的言行，激起了广大中国人民的义愤。当我们不得不起而自卫并开始反击干涉者以后，他们却又装成无罪的羔羊了。印度“自由新闻”4月24日的社论说，“中国可能认为印度明智的节制态度是软弱的表现。”好一个“明智的节制态度”！西藏叛乱以来，你们对中国人民、中国政府以至国家元首的放肆的诬蔑、诽谤、侮辱还不够吗？如果不“节制”，那又该如何呢？难道还打算向西藏出兵吗？不错，在1886—1888年和1904年，英帝国主义曾经对西藏进行过两次军事侵略，但是都以失败告终。料想你们不能也不敢再走这条老路。现在，西藏叛乱已经基本上平息了。西藏人民热烈拥护中央政府和人民解放军，正在祖国大家庭走向新生。印度扩张主义分子大叫大喊中国“侵略”印度，“威胁”印度，不外乎还想用造谣来煽动印度人民对中国的仇恨，挑拨离间中印两国人民的友谊。亲爱的先生们，可以预言，你们的见不得太阳的阴谋诡计，一定会遭到更可耻的失败。
    中国人民已经一再表示，我们一向是以中印友谊为重的。不过，我们要诚恳地奉劝你们：态度应当放老实些，既不要当豺狼，也无需装作无罪的羔羊。
