The Despicable Tricks of "Voice of America"
By Our Correspondent

The American propaganda machine is seizing every opportunity to intensify its attempts to drive a wedge between China and India's friendly relations, even resorting to despicable practices such as distorting facts and spreading rumors to mislead the public. The latest example is the "Voice of America" broadcast at 6:00 AM on the 15th. This notorious American rumor mill spread a so-called "Beijing News" saying that at the banquet welcoming the Panchen Erdeni, "Both the Panchen Lama and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai accused that the Dalai Lama was detained under coercion by rebels in India."

Please note that "Voice of America," using the tactic of substituting one thing for another, added the words "in India" before "rebels."

What are the facts?

How did Premier Zhou Enlai speak at the banquet? Premier Zhou said: "While we gather together, the Dalai Lama has been abducted abroad by the rebels. From the three letters of the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan, the acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet, we can see his distress and situation. We, along with all the people of Tibet, express our deep concern for the Dalai Lama."

The Panchen Erdeni said in his speech: "The majority of the Kalons and the upper-level reactionary groups of the former Tibetan local government, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and foreign reactionaries, openly launched a full-scale armed rebellion in Lhasa, abducting the Dalai Lama and openly betraying the country."

From the original words of Premier Zhou Enlai and the Panchen Erdeni, where can one find any shadow of "detained under coercion by rebels in India"? Not long ago, the American columnist Brown complained that "Voice of America" did not seize the Tibetan rebellion to carry out anti-communist propaganda on a large scale in Asia, but seemed to be just pretending to be "objective" and reporting "in a straightforward manner." It seems that "Voice of America" has been stimulated by this criticism and has gone even further than its accusers, once again resorting to its signature skills of distortion and rumor-mongering!

The intention of "Voice of America" in using this despicable method is nothing more than to incite discord, sow dissension, and spread misunderstandings about China among the Indian people. American news agencies and newspapers have recently been promoting the "threat" of China to India and the "growing suspicion" of Indians towards China every day. United Press International reporter Hoberecht even bluntly stated: "Since the Tibetan issue, the Indian government and public opinion have turned against the Chinese Communists." These are all daydreams of the American imperialists in broad daylight. The American imperialists are so enthusiastic about provoking discord between China and India, which deserves high vigilance. The friendly and harmonious Chinese and Indian people, numbering one billion, are an important force in maintaining Asian peace and are precisely the thorn in the side of American imperialism. All those who care about Asian peace and the common interests of China and India must not allow American imperialism to use the Tibetan rebellion to undermine the traditional friendly relations between China and India, which are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It is the urgent task of Chinese and Indian public opinion to expose the distortions and rumors of American propaganda machines such as "Voice of America" in a timely manner and to see through the sinister intentions of American imperialism.

    “美国之音”的卑鄙伎俩
    本报评论员
    美国的宣传机器，正在寻找一切机会，加紧挑拨中印友好关系，甚至不惜公然采取歪曲事实、造谣惑众的卑鄙做法。最新的一个例子是“美国之音”15日晨六时的广播。这个臭名远扬的美国造谣机器散播所谓“北平消息”说，在欢迎班禅额尔德尼的宴会上，“班禅喇嘛和中共总理周恩来都指责说，达赖喇嘛是在印度反叛分子的强迫之下被拘禁的。”
    请大家注意，“美国之音”用偷梁换柱的手法，在“反叛分子”之前加上了“在印度”这几个字。
    事实是怎样的呢？
    周恩来总理在宴会上是怎样讲的呢？周总理说：“当我们欢聚在一起的时候，达赖喇嘛却已经被叛乱分子劫出国外。从达赖喇嘛给中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三将军的三封信中，我们可以看出他的苦衷和处境。我们同全体西藏人民一样，对达赖喇嘛表示深切的关怀。”
    班禅额尔德尼在致词中说的是：“原西藏地方政府多数噶伦和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和国外反动派，在拉萨公然掀起全面的武装叛乱，劫持达赖喇嘛，公开叛国。”
    从周恩来总理和班禅额尔德尼的原话中，哪里找得到什么“在印度反叛分子的强迫之下被拘禁的”的影子呢？不久以前，美国的专栏作家布朗曾经埋怨“美国之音”没有抓住西藏叛乱在亚洲大搞反共宣传，而似乎只是硬装成“客观”的样子在“平铺直叙地”报道。看来，“美国之音”受了这个刺激，已经比它的指责者走得更远一些，又施出它那歪曲和造谣的看家本领来了！
      “美国之音”这种卑鄙的手法，其用意无非是煽风点火，挑拨离间，在印度人民中间散播对中国的误解。美国的通讯社和报纸最近成天在宣传中国对印度的“威胁”、印度人对中国“已经越来越怀疑”。合众国际社记者霍布雷奇特甚至露骨地说：“印度政府和舆论从西藏问题发生以来就转而反对中国共产党人”。这些都是美帝国主义者在光天化日之下做的梦。美帝国主义如此热心挑拨中印的不和，值得引起高度的警惕。友好和睦的中印两国十亿人民，是维护亚洲和平的重要力量，也正是美帝国主义的眼中钉。一切关心亚洲和平和中印两国共同利益的人，绝不能容许美帝国主义利用西藏叛乱事件来破坏中印两国这种建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的传统的友好关系。及时揭穿“美国之音”之类的美国宣传机器的歪曲、造谣，看透美帝国主义的险恶用心，是中印舆论界的迫切任务。
