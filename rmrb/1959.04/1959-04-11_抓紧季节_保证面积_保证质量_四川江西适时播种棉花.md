Seize the Season, Ensure Acreage, Guarantee Quality
Sichuan and Jiangxi Sow Cotton at the Right Time

　　Chengdu, April 10th (by our newspaper) – Sichuan Province's cotton-producing areas are seizing the season and making an all-out effort to rush the cotton sowing work. It is expected that the province will basically complete its sowing plan in the near future.

　　This year, Sichuan's planned cotton planting area has expanded from 1,710,000 mu last year to 6,810,000 mu. In order to lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest, all localities have grasped the important link of sowing from the beginning and taken measures to ensure the timely and high-quality completion of the sowing plan. Counties, districts, and communes in key cotton-producing areas have all established shock cotton planting command posts, headed by the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels, concentrating superior forces to carry out a vigorous shock cotton planting campaign. In Jianyang County, the labor force invested in cotton planting accounts for more than 70% of the total labor force. By the 3rd, the county had overfulfilled the sowing task of 400,000 mu of cotton fields. In the shock sowing, all localities have fully implemented the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture to improve the quality of sowing. According to inspections and acceptance by relevant departments, general cotton fields have been deeply ploughed to a foot; 30,000 to 50,000 jin of fertilizer are applied per mu; and the density is generally 4,000 to 5,000 plants per mu.

　　Our newspaper reports: People's communes in various parts of Jiangxi Province, under the slogan of "Seize the season, seize sunny days, seize the time, and strive for initiative," have begun to sow cotton in large quantities. The sowing quality generally meets the requirements. This year, Jiangxi Province plans to plant 3,000,000 mu of cotton, an increase of one and a half times compared to last year. The planned output of ginned cotton is an average of 100 jin per mu, with a total output of 3,000,000 dan, an increase of more than two times compared to last year.

　　In order to solve the contradiction between cotton and some spring-harvested crops for land, and to strive for a double harvest of cotton and spring-harvested crops, most localities have adopted the method of transplanting seedlings grown in nutrient pots. Some areas, combined with topdressing wheat fields, have deeply cultivated between the rows of wheat and applied sufficient base fertilizer to ensure timely sowing of cotton. At the same time, many areas have held forums for technicians, experienced farmers, and cotton planting experts to exchange cotton planting techniques and summarize cotton planting experiences.

　　四川江西适时播种棉花
    本报成都10日电　四川省各棉产区抓紧季节、全力突击棉花播种工作。预计全省在最近即可基本完成播种计划。
    今年四川棉田计划播种面积，由去年的一百七十一万亩扩大为六百八十一万亩。为了给大丰收打下坚固的基础，各地一开始就抓紧了播种这一重要环节，采取措施，保证按时按质完成播种计划。各重点棉产区的县、区、社都成立了突击种棉指挥部，由各级党委书记挂帅，集中优势兵力，开展了轰轰烈烈的突击种棉运动。简阳县投入种棉的劳力占全部劳力70％以上。到3日止，全县就超额完成了四十万亩棉田的播种任务。各地在突击播种中，全面实行八字宪法，提高播种质量。据有关部门检查验收，一般棉田都深耕一尺；每亩施肥三至五万斤；密度一般是每亩四千到五千株。　（刘宗棠）
    本报讯　江西省各地人民公社在“抓季节，抓晴天，抢时间，争主动”的口号下，开始大量播种棉花。播种质量一般都符合要求。今年江西省植棉计划面积是三百万亩，比去年扩大一倍半，皮棉产量计划平均每亩百斤，总产量三百万担，比去年增加二倍多。
    为解决棉花和部分春收作物争地的矛盾，争取棉花和春收作物双丰收，各地较普遍地采取以营养钵育苗移栽的办法。有的地区结合麦地追肥，在麦行间深锄，下足了底肥，保证了棉花适时播种。同时，许多地区召开了技术员、老农和植棉能手座谈会，交流植棉技术，总结植棉经验。　（王忠和）
