Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered a radio speech today on the Central People's Broadcasting Station entitled "Eliminate the Threat of War and Safeguard World Peace," condemning the criminal activities of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc over the past decade. The full text of the radio speech is as follows:

    Today is the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc – the North Atlantic Treaty Organization – planned and led by the United States. For ten years, this aggressive bloc has consistently pursued a policy of escalating the Cold War, the arms race, and creating international tensions, hindering international trust and cooperation, spreading war-fearful clouds in the world, and constantly posing a serious threat to world peace. Peace-loving people all over the world have expressed strong condemnation of the actions of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc over the past decade. The people of the world clearly understand how much damage a new war would bring to the lives and property of people of all countries. Easing tensions, eliminating the threat of war, and striving for a peaceful and prosperous life are the wishes of most countries and the universal and strong demands of mankind. However, a handful of die-hard imperialists, especially the war-mongering group in the United States, harboring ambitions to dominate the world and enslave mankind, threaten and intimidate countries and peoples that maintain peace from a "position of strength," and prepare to provoke a new world war. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established ten years ago today for this purpose.

    In order to conceal its aggressive essence, the heads of this aggressive bloc have taken the slanderous tunes of "Communist threat" and "Soviet aggression" from the armory of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki, and under the guise of "collective defense" and "collective security," they have been engaged in dangerous activities of inciting the Cold War, accelerating the arms race, destroying peace, and preparing for war. What has particularly aroused the anger and opposition of peace-loving countries and people around the world is that American imperialism openly dragged West Germany into the North Atlantic Group, actively armed West Germany, revived German militarism, and placed a large number of Hitler's Nazi bandits, who had once stained their hands with the blood of peaceful people, in important positions in commanding the army of this aggressive group. The Bonn meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council in May 1957 even decided to legalize West Germany's atomic armament. All this shows that the United States is desperately supporting the most aggressive West German militarist forces that have twice provoked world wars and massacred tens of millions of peaceful people as the vanguard force for launching new wars of aggression. It is clear that the North Atlantic Group, from the day it was established, has become the most important tool for the United States to undermine world peace and prepare for a new world war.

    The anti-peace and anti-people aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Group is also manifested in its consistent aggression and intervention activities in Asia and Africa. The member states of the North Atlantic Group include all major colonial countries. It has consistently maintained colonial interests and become the general headquarters for suppressing national independence movements. The North Atlantic Group supports the French colonialists' colonial war against Algeria; supports imperialist intervention in Indonesia's internal affairs and launches military rebellions; supports US and British aggression in the Middle East; and supports imperialism's barbaric rule and bloody suppression of colonial people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. As everyone knows, the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Treaty were organized by the main member states of the North Atlantic Group, the United States, Britain, and France, which have presided over and supported all the aggressive activities of the treaty groups, and these aggressive activities primarily endanger the peace and national interests of the people of Southeast Asia and the Near and Middle East. The North Atlantic Group is the sworn enemy of the national independence movements throughout the world, especially in Asia and Africa. This is irrefutable evidence.

    In the ten years since its establishment, the North Atlantic Group has never put forward a proposal conducive to peace and international cooperation, and has never taken a positive attitude to ease international tensions. On the contrary, it has rejected any constructive initiatives put forward by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. Whenever there are some signs that international tensions are easing, whenever there is some possibility of improving relations between the East and the West, the most reactionary forces in the United States, through the North Atlantic Group, take various measures to prevent the development of this trend. The establishment of this aggressive bloc has become a major root cause of the long-term tension in the international situation since World War II, and at the same time, it has become a source of new wars threatening world peace. This cannot but arouse serious anxiety and resolute opposition from peace-loving countries and people around the world.

    For ten years, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the forces of peace throughout the world have waged unremitting struggles against the aggressive and war policies of the North Atlantic Group for the cause of peace, security, and international cooperation. The Soviet government and other socialist countries' governments have continuously exposed the criminal activities of the North Atlantic Group in undermining peace and have put forward a series of proposals aimed at easing international tensions and improving East-West relations. The positive significance of the Soviet government's proposals on major countries reducing armaments, permanently ceasing nuclear weapons testing, and resolving major current international issues through negotiations, especially summit meetings, is well known. What should be particularly pointed out is that in order to consolidate European peace and security, the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed that the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty be abolished simultaneously, or that these two organizations conclude a treaty of non-aggression. The Soviet government also proposed the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to ensure the collective security of Europe. These major proposals have been repeatedly rejected by Western countries headed by the United States, but despite this, the Soviet government continues its unremitting efforts. In its statement of March 29 this year, the Soviet government reiterated these peaceful proposals and advocated that an agreement be reached between members of the North Atlantic Group and members of the Warsaw Treaty on the issue of not providing assistance to aggressors. All this demonstrates the Soviet government's sincere desire to ease international tensions and promote peaceful cooperation. We, the Chinese people, fully support the Soviet government's proposals and efforts.

    Peace is the fundamental demand and fundamental interest of people all over the world. All peace-loving people urgently hope that the international situation can be eased, the international atmosphere can be improved, and international trust and cooperation can be restored and strengthened. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, which was held in Moscow not long ago, adopted a "Resolution on Ending the 'Cold War'." The resolution pointed out: "People all over the world hate the 'Cold War,' and they demand an end to the 'Cold War.' Now this desire has become so strong that the governments of all countries have to take it into consideration." We believe that this resolution will greatly promote the common struggle of the people of all countries to strive for peace and end the "Cold War."

    The North Atlantic Treaty is a black treaty, an aggressive treaty and a war treaty, and it is completely unpopular. All anti-peace and anti-people military blocs can have no other future than their final collapse.

    The East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. Peace will inevitably defeat war. Peaceful coexistence is what people want and the trend of the times. This is an irresistible force. The North Atlantic Group, especially the United States at its head, no matter how stubbornly it acts in its own way, goes against the tide, and insists on a "Cold War" policy to exacerbate international tensions, they will inevitably only suffer greater failures. We, the Chinese people, sincerely wish to join hands with peace-loving people all over the world to work together to eliminate the threat of new wars, to promote international trust and cooperation, and to defend lasting world peace.

    郭沫若发表广播演说指出
    北大西洋集团十年来加紧备战
    成为威胁和平的新战争策源地
    新华社4日讯  中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若，今天在中央人民广播电台发表题为“消除战争威胁，维护世界和平”的广播演说，谴责北大西洋侵略集团十年来的罪恶活动。广播演说全文如下：
    今天是美国所策划的和所领导的北大西洋侵略集团——北大西洋公约组织成立的十周年。十年来，这个侵略集团一贯地执行着加剧冷战、军备竞赛和制造国际紧张局势的政策，阻挠着国际信任和合作，在世界上空散布战争恐惧的乌云，使世界和平经常遭受到严重的威胁。全世界爱好和平的人民对北大西洋侵略集团十年来的所作所为一致表示强烈的谴责。全世界人民清楚地了解，新的战争将会给世界各国人民的生命、财产带来多么巨大的损失。缓和紧张局势、消除战争威胁、争取和平与丰裕的生活，这是大多数国家的愿望，是人类普遍的强烈的要求。但是一小撮冥顽不灵的帝国主义者，特别是美国的好战集团，他们怀着独霸世界和奴役人类的野心，从“实力地位”出发，对维护和平的国家和人民进行威胁和恫吓，并准备挑起一次新的世界战争。北大西洋公约组织就是为了这个目的在十年前的今天建立起来的。
    为了掩盖自己的侵略实质，这个侵略集团的头子们从希特勒、墨索里尼和东条英机的武器库里搬出了所谓“共产主义威胁”和“苏联侵略”的谰调，打着“集体防御”、“集体安全”的幌子，进行着煽动冷战、加速军备竞赛、破坏和平、准备战争的危险活动。特别引起全世界爱好和平国家和人民的愤怒和反对的是，美帝国主义公然把西德拉入北大西洋集团，积极武装西德，复活德国军国主义，把大批曾经双手沾满和平人民鲜血的希特勒纳粹匪徒安置在统率这个侵略集团的军队的重要岗位上。1957年5月北大西洋集团理事会波恩会议，竟然决定使西德原子武装合法化。这一切说明了美国正拚命扶植曾经两次挑起世界大战、屠杀过成千万和平人民的最富于侵略性的西德军国主义势力，以作为它发动新的侵略战争的突击力量。很明显，北大西洋集团从成立的一天起，就已成为美国破坏世界和平、准备新的世界战争的最重要的工具了。
    北大西洋集团反和平、反人民的侵略性质也表现在它一贯地对亚非地区的侵略和干涉活动上。北大西洋集团的成员国包括了所有主要的殖民国家。它一贯维护殖民利益，成为镇压民族独立运动的总司令部。北大西洋集团支持法国殖民者对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争；支持帝国主义干涉印度尼西亚的内政，发动军事叛乱；支持美、英侵略中东；支持帝国主义在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲对殖民地人民进行野蛮的统治和血腥的镇压。众所周知，是北大西洋集团的主要成员国美英法组织了马尼拉条约和巴格达条约，主持和支持了参加条约集团的一切侵略活动，而这些侵略活动首先是危害东南亚和中近东各国人民的和平利益和民族利益的。北大西洋集团是全世界特别是亚、非地区的民族独立运动的死敌，这是铁证如山，无法抵赖的。
    北大西洋集团在它成立以来的十年中，从来没有提出过一个有利于和平和国际合作的建议，从来没有采取过缓和国际紧张局势的积极态度。相反，它拒绝了苏联和其他爱好和平的国家所提出的任何建设性的倡议。每当国际紧张局势有趋向缓和的某些迹象的时候，每当东西方关系中出现了某种可以改善的可能的时候，美国最反动的势力就通过北大西洋集团采取各种措施来阻止这种趋势的发展。这个侵略集团的建立已经成为第二次世界大战以后国际局势长期保持紧张的一个主要祸根，同时它也成了威胁世界和平的新战争的策源地。这就不能不激起全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的严重不安和坚决反对。
    十年来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界维护和平的力量，为了和平安全和国际合作的事业，曾对北大西洋集团的侵略政策和战争政策进行了坚持不懈的斗争。苏联政府和其他社会主义国家政府不断揭露北大西洋集团破坏和平的罪恶活动，并且提出了一系列旨在缓和国际紧张局势、改善东西方关系的建议。苏联政府关于大国裁减军备、永远停止核武器爆炸试验、通过谈判特别是首脑会议来解决当前重大国际问题等等建议的积极意义，是人所共知的。特别应该指出的是苏联政府为了巩固欧洲的和平与安全，曾多次建议华沙条约和北大西洋公约同时废除，或者由这两个组织缔结互不侵犯条约。苏联政府还建议缔结对德和约以保障欧洲的集体安全。这些重大建议都一再遭受到以美国为首的西方国家的拒绝，尽管这样，然而苏联政府仍然在继续着不懈的努力。苏联政府在今年3月29日的声明中，重申了这些和平建议，并且主张在北大西洋集团成员国同华沙条约成员国之间就不给侵略者以援助问题达成协议。这一切都表明了苏联政府对缓和国际紧张局势、促进和平合作的真诚愿望。我们中国人民完全支持苏联政府的主张和努力。
    和平是全世界人民的根本要求和根本利益。一切爱好和平的人民都迫切地希望国际局势能够缓和，国际气氛能够改善，国际信任和合作能够恢复和加强。不久以前在莫斯科举行的世界和平理事会常务委员会上通过了“结束‘冷战’的决议”。这个决议指出：“全世界的人都仇视‘冷战’，他们要求结束‘冷战’。现在这种愿望已经如此强烈，以致一切国家的政府都不得不加以考虑了。”我们相信，这个决议将大大地推动各国人民争取和平和结束“冷战”的共同斗争。
    北大西洋公约是黑约，是侵略性的条约和战争条约，是完全不得人心的。一切反和平、反人民的军事集团除了最后垮台以外，不可能有别的前途。
    东风已经压倒西风。和平必然战胜战争。和平共处已是人心所向，大势所趋。这是不可抗拒的力量。北大西洋集团特别是为首的美国，尽管怎样一意孤行，倒行逆施，坚持“冷战”政策，以加剧国际紧张局势，它们必然只会遭到更大的失败。我们中国人民真诚地愿意同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为消除新战争的威胁、为促进国际信任和合作、为捍卫世界持久和平而共同奋斗。
