I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of other leaders. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the technical innovation of foundation engineering in Shanghai's industrial construction.

This year is the second year of the three years of hard work in our country's Second Five-Year Plan. With the great leap forward of national industry and agriculture and the progress of large-scale economic construction, Shanghai's infrastructure construction tasks are becoming more arduous and challenging. In order to thoroughly implement the general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical" to complete this major task, we must first solve the difficulties encountered in foundation engineering in industrial construction. We must adhere to putting politics in command, strive to break superstitions, launch mass movements on a large scale, make great efforts in technical revolution, combine soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, and adopt new tools, new equipment, new technologies, new materials, new designs, and construction methods to adapt to the special conditions of Shanghai's hydrogeology, soil, and climate, as well as the high-precision, advanced, and cutting-edge industrial production goals.

Shanghai's soil, apart from a very thin surface layer of yellow sticky good soil, is generally a very deep layer of silty saturated soft soil. Building large industrial factory buildings that are both heavy and tall on this type of soil layer makes foundation treatment a serious issue.

Before liberation, Shanghai only had a few high-rise civil buildings, and very few large industrial factory buildings. For heavy foundations, the methods left over from capitalist society were generally adopted, using very long wooden piles, concrete piles, and mixed wood-concrete piles, burying a large amount of valuable wood, cement, steel bars, etc., underground, causing a shortage of raw materials.

In the current socialist large-scale infrastructure construction, due to the large number of projects required and the urgency of completion time, it is absolutely impossible to continue doing things in such a slow, poor, and wasteful way. Natural foundations should be used as much as possible to shorten the construction period. If artificial foundations must be used, then cheap and abundant local materials and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods should be used to make the foundations, saving more expensive raw materials as much as possible and solving the supply difficulties of these materials.

Since liberation, the foundations used in Shanghai's industrial buildings have been nothing more than natural foundations and pile foundations. Natural foundations include individual foundations, strip foundations, and box foundations. Pile foundations include wooden piles, precast solid square reinforced concrete piles, precast hollow tubular reinforced concrete piles, and vibratory in-situ cast-in-place round concrete piles. Each type of foundation has some advantages, but also many disadvantages.

In order to correct the shortcomings of these foundations, save raw materials, and create new types of foundations using local materials, Shanghai first tried using expanded restrike cast-in-place reinforced concrete or concrete piles. The original single-strike cast-in-place piles were restruck in their original position using the original pile tube with an added pile tip, repeatedly lowering the tube and pouring concrete to increase the cross-sectional area and slenderness ratio of the pile, as well as the density of the surrounding soil, thereby increasing the bearing capacity of the pile and basically eliminating the bottlenecks, fractures, voids, and mud inclusions of single-strike cast-in-place piles, ensuring the quality of the pile.

Secondly, large-scale sand cushions are used to replace soil to expand the load-bearing area of the foundation, while accelerating the settlement time and acting as preloading.

Thirdly, experiments are being conducted on large-scale deep densely driven drainage and compaction sand piles in order to accelerate the consolidation of the soil, increase the bearing capacity of the soil, and reduce the settlement size of the soil.

Finally, the electrolysis polymerization method is being tested to use calcium chloride and sodium silicate chemical solutions and electric current, passed into the soil, to cause electrolysis polymerization to strengthen the foundation.

Based on these leap-forward measures, it is recommended that the following five principles of innovation be followed in the foundation design of industrial buildings in the future: 1. For general column foundations, use individual foundations, or add sand cushions. 2. For column foundations where the soil is still good, there is less equipment, and the load is relatively large (50-ton crane), use strip foundations.

3. For column foundations where the soil is relatively poor, there is more equipment, and the load is very large (75-ton or more crane), use general pile foundations or sand pile reinforcement, depending on the local soil conditions. Here, general pile foundations include precast solid square reinforced concrete piles or hollow tubular piles, but do not include single-strike cast-in-place round concrete or reinforced concrete piles.

4. For column foundations where the construction period is particularly urgent and the load is particularly heavy (100-ton or more crane), if the soil is not good, use expanded restrike cast-in-place reinforced concrete or concrete piles, because this type of pile has a large bearing capacity and a small number of piles, and construction is faster.

5. Box foundations should only be used for high-rise or special historical civil buildings, and should not be used for heavy industrial factory buildings.

If the foundations of Shanghai's industrial buildings do not reach the harder and thicker soil layer below the ground, then whether it is a natural foundation, sand cushion foundation, sand pile foundation, precast pile, or cast-in-place pile, solid pile or hollow pile pile foundation, there will generally be considerable and extremely long-term settlement. When building factory buildings on this type of silty saturated soft soil, Soviet expert Aberlev believes that the general house and industrial structure natural foundation design standards and technical specifications (HИTY127-55) are not applicable. The limit settlement value specified in this specification will inevitably be exceeded to a greater or lesser extent. At this time, in general, the following treatments should be made according to the requirements of the process and the nature of the structure:

1.  The foundation is designed according to deformation to control the total settlement amount S. Assume that the settlement amount during construction is ——. Then the allowable settlement amount when the building is completed and put into use is ——.
2.  Therefore, when designing the structure, the base elevation should be raised in advance by S——. If the settlement exceeds this number in the future, it can be raised again to make up for it. The foundation of a blast furnace in a factory in Shanghai was adjusted according to this method.
3.  Leave 30 centimeters of clearance between the lower chord of the roof truss and the top surface of the crane, which is more than the specified headroom, so that the crane beam can be raised and adjusted when the column foundation settles in the future.

This can avoid spending a lot of money and materials to strengthen the foundation and reduce settlement.

The Soviet Union has been using this method for buildings on collapsible loess for 25 years.

The soil in Leningrad, Soviet Union, is similar to that in Shanghai. In the past, most of the building foundations there were piled, but now most of them are not piled, but the allowable settlement amount is increased to 50 to 70 centimeters.

However, for some key factory equipment such as casting pits, ingot pits, and flues, the process requires absolute waterproofness. If the foundation is not strong enough and the settlement is too large, the steel shell welds will crack, or if the uneven settlement is too large, settlement joints must be made, and the quality cannot be guaranteed. These cracked welds and poor-quality settlement joints are extremely prone to leakage, which poses a danger of explosion. For the foundations of these buildings, it is necessary to consider minimizing settlement and making them particularly strong. If piling is required, it should be done.

This time, Shanghai, in accordance with the spirit of the three-way combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses of workers, and the principle of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, is determined to try to use expanded restrike concrete or reinforced concrete cast-in-place piles, experiment with large-scale new deep densely driven sand piles, and improve those pile foundation designs and settlement treatment methods with a long history inherited from the previous capitalist society. These advanced and innovative foundation designs and construction methods are all things that engineers in Shanghai and throughout China have never thought of, said, or done. We must launch a vigorous technical revolution to pave the way for all new types of foundations.

As for how to innovate Shanghai's foundation treatment methods to be fast, good, safe, and economical, we hope that domestic experts will give it their deep attention and offer valuable opinions.

Appendix (1) Expanded Restrike Reinforced Concrete or Concrete Cast-in-Place Piles

According to the static load test data of several on-site tests conducted in the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and the Hudong Shipyard in 1958, it is fully proved that the bearing capacity of cast-in-place piles after expansion and restrike is far greater than that of single-strike type. The more times the expansion is done, the greater the bearing capacity. However, because it only takes about two hours to perform a single expansion of a cast-in-place pile, while it takes a total of four hours to perform a triple expansion of a cast-in-place pile. During this long four-hour repeated pipe driving, concrete pouring, and pipe pulling time, it is inevitable that all construction machinery will fail, which will greatly delay the time. In order to ensure that the initial setting time of the concrete is not exceeded, an appropriate amount of plasticizer must be added to extend it. Therefore, although the economic indicators of triple expansion cast-in-place piles are much higher than those of single expansion, in fact, the technical requirements for construction are very high, and the quality is difficult to guarantee. On the contrary, single expansion piles are more reliable and worth promoting.

Appendix (2)

Sand Piles

There are two types of sand piles. The first is to use shallow sand wells with a large distance, and preload for one year to remove the water in the soil, increase the density of the soil, thereby strengthening the foundation. The second is to use deep densely driven sand piles with a small distance, and preload for one or two months to compact and consolidate the soil and accelerate the settlement speed.

In view of the fact that the permeability of Shanghai soil is very small and water is not easily discharged from the soil particles, and in order to shorten the construction period and reduce the total settlement value, the second type of deep densely driven sand piles was adopted for on-site testing. The test method is to select a large column foundation with a load of 2,700 tons and dimensions of 6 meters by 9 meters to do a large-area group pile giant sand pile test pressure, and pre-strengthen the sand pile itself. The length of the sand pile is 15 meters, reaching the distribution depth of the 0.2P isobaric line of the foundation. For heavy foundations, 40% of the sand piles are extended downwards by 10% to reach the distribution depth of the 0.1P isobaric line of the foundation to form sand wells to accelerate the settlement speed. A one-meter thick sand cushion is placed on top. The center distance of the sand piles is 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter of the pile. The number of piles is about 300, evenly distributed in an equilateral triangle under the entire foundation. The average diameter of the pile is 44 centimeters. The pile tube is driven by a vibratory cast-in-place pile driver, but the tube foot is modified with a hinged opening tube shoe, which opens automatically when the tube is pulled out and closes automatically when it is driven in. One initial strike and two restrikes are required. Fine sand is used on the outside and coarse sand is used on the inside to achieve a reverse filter effect. The second restrike only reaches the bottom surface of the sand cushion in order to pour the sand cushion. The direction of the pile driving tube is from the outside to the inside in a spiral shape. The total volume of the sand pile accounts for about 30% of the entire foundation reinforcement range.

In order to strengthen the water absorption effect, after the pile tube is driven into the soil, the tube is first filled with quicklime bags, and then the pile tube is pulled up and restruck with wooden piles to squeeze the lime bags into the soil around the sand pile, and then sand is poured in.

Making deep and dense sand piles and sand cushions under the foundation, and strengthening the soil, there will be a very thick load-bearing soil layer, the effect of which is similar to driving very long reinforced concrete piles, but its cost is lower than that of long reinforced concrete piles, and the materials consumed are only sand, and the amount of sand consumed is not much different from that of long reinforced concrete piles.

Appendix (3) General Pile Foundations (Innovative)

When the harder soil layer below the ground is not deep and has sufficient thickness, the pile tip can be passed through the weak soil and driven into this harder soil layer, relying as much as possible on the pile end support force and using less of the pile circumferential friction force. In this way, the length of the pile used is not too large, and the settlement amount is also small.

When the harder soil layer below the ground is very deep, of course, modern science and technology can be used to drive piles of any length, but if you want to drive the pile tip into this hard layer, the pile length is too large, which not only requires a lot of materials, but also greatly increases the difficulty of pile driving, the cost is too expensive, and the construction period is extended, which violates the general principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. At this time, instead of using longer piles to reduce the amount of settlement, it is better to use shorter piles, relying entirely on the frictional resistance enhanced on the side of the pile after the pile is driven into the soil to bear the load, and appropriately adjusting the deviations given to the building by settlement or uneven settlement.

However, there must also be sufficient length for driving short reinforced concrete piles, so that:

1.  The building does not have large deformations and can guarantee stability.
2.  The soil at the base does not bulge due to being squeezed.

Furthermore, if a harder soil layer cannot be found not far from the ground, it is better to drive sand piles than to drive short friction piles. The spacing of the sand piles is small, which is equivalent to replacing the bad soil with good sand in the reinforcement range, increasing the compression modulus and reducing the amount of settlement, and because the compression modulus is relatively uniform, uneven settlement will not occur.

Except for a harder and thicker soil layer in certain areas, Shanghai's soil is generally loose saturated silty soil. The problem is not to find a harder and thicker soil layer to support the rigid pile tip, but to find measures to safely use the building under controlled settlement. If the use of the structure and the settlement of the foundation piles are considered at the same time, then even a larger settlement amount is allowed.

    工业建筑基础工程的技术革新
    李学海委员的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告以及其他各位首长的报告，现在我就上海市工业建设中基础工程的技术革新问题，发表一些意见。
    今年是我国第二个五年计划中苦战三年的第二年，随着国家工农业的大跃进与大规模经济建设的进展，上海市的基建任务是更加繁重而艰巨，为了很好地贯彻总路线多快好省的方针来完成这项重大任务，必须首先解决在工业建设中基础工程所遇到的若干困难问题，坚持政治挂帅、争取破除迷信、大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命、使冲天干劲与科学分析相结合、采用新工具、新设备、新技术、新材料、新设计和施工方法，以适应上海市水文地质土壤气象的特殊条件和高精大尖的工业生产目标。
    上海土壤除很薄的面层为黄粘好土外，以下一般为很深的淤泥质饱和软土，在这种土层上建造既重且高的大型工业厂屋，对于基础处理就成为一个严重问题。
    解放以前，上海只有少数高层民用建筑，大型工业厂房极少，对于重型基础，一般采用资本主义社会遗留下来的方式，夯打极长的木桩，?桩，?木混合桩，将很宝贵的大量木材水泥钢筋等埋置地下，造成原材料的供应紧张。
    在目前社会主义的大规模基建中，由于需要的工程数量很大和完工的时间很急，绝不容许这样少慢差费地做下去，应当尽量采用天然地基以缩短工期，若必须采用人工基础，则应利用价廉量大的地方性材料和土洋结合的方法，来做基础，尽可能节约较贵重的原材料，和解决这些材料的供应困难。
    解放以来，上海工业建筑所用的基础，不外乎天然地基和桩基，天然地基有单独基础，条形基础，箱形基础三种，桩基有木桩，钢筋混凝土预制实心方桩，钢筋混凝土预制空心管桩，钢筋混凝土或混凝土震动式就地灌注圆桩四种，每种基础虽然有些优点，但也有不少缺点。
    为了纠正这些基础的缺点，以及节约原材料，并且利用地方性材料创造新型基础起见，上海市首先试用钢筋混凝土或混凝土扩大式复击灌注桩，将原有单打的灌注桩，在原地位用原桩管加放桩尖，重复下管和灌注混凝土来复击，以增加桩的断面积和细长比，以及四周土壤的密实度，因而提高桩的承载力量，并且基本上消除单打灌注桩的瓶颈，断裂，脱空，夹泥等弊病，保证桩的质量。
    其次，是用大型砂垫层来换土，以扩大基础的载重面积，同时，加速沉陷时间起预压作用。
    再次，是试验大型深层密打的排水和挤实砂桩，以期加速土壤的固结程度，提高土壤的承载力量，减少土壤的沉陷尺寸。
    最后，是试验电解重合法，以便利用氯化钙和矽化钠化学溶液和电流，通入土中，发生电解重合，来加固地基。
    根据以上这些跃进的措施，建议今后按照下列五项革新原则进行工业建筑的基础设计：1、一般柱基，用单独基础，或加用砂垫层。2、土壤尚好，设备较少，载重较大（50吨吊车）的柱基，用条形基础。
    3、土壤较坏，设备较多，载重很大（75吨以上吊车）的柱基，用一般桩基或砂桩加固，视当地土壤情况而定，这里一般桩基，系包括钢筋混凝土预制实心方桩或空心管桩，但不包括单打式混凝土或钢筋混凝土就地灌注圆桩。
    4、工期特别紧急载重特别重大（100吨以上吊车）的柱基，如若土壤不好，则用钢筋混凝土或混凝土扩大式复击灌注桩，因为这种桩的承载量大而根数少，施工较快。
    5、箱形基础，只宜用于高层或有历史性的特种民用建筑，而不宜用于重型工业厂房。
    上海工业建筑物基础，如若达不到地面下的较硬厚土层则无论是天然地基，砂垫层地基，砂桩地基，预制桩或灌注桩实心桩或空心桩桩基，一般都有相当大和极长久的沉陷。在这种淤泥质饱和软土上建造厂房，苏联专家阿别列夫认为一般房屋和工业结构物天然地基设计标准及技术规范（HИTY127-55）不能适用，这个规范中所规定的极限沉陷值，势将或多或少地被超过，此时，在一般情况下，惟有视工艺的要求和结构的性质而作如下的处理：
    1、基础按变形设计控制总沉陷量S。S假定施工期间的沉陷量为——。2则在建S筑完成时交付使用的允许沉陷量为—— 。
    2因而在设计结构物时预先升高基底标高S——，将来如若沉过此数，还可再在上面加高2补足，上海某厂高炉基础即照此法调整的。
    2、在屋架下弦与吊车顶面间，较规定净空多留三十公分空隙，以便将来柱基沉陷时，可以提高吊车梁加以调整。
    这样便可避免耗费很多金钱和材料，来加固地基与减少沉陷。
    苏联在沉陷性大孔土上的建筑物，应用此法，已有二十五年的历史。
    苏联列宁格勒的土壤与上海相似，从前那里做建筑物基础大都打桩，而现在大都不打桩，但允许沉陷量增加到五十公分至七十公分。
    但在某些重点工厂的浇铸坑钢锭坑烟道等设备，工艺方面是要求绝对防水的，如若基础不够坚固，沉陷过多，会使钢壳焊缝开裂，或者不均匀沉陷太大，必然要做沉降缝，质量难以保证。这些裂开的焊缝和质量不好的沉降缝，极易漏水，而发生爆炸的危险。对于这些建筑物的基础，必须要考虑尽量减少沉陷而做得特别坚固，如须打桩，应当照打。
    这次上海市根据领导干部，技术人员，工人群众三结合的精神，以及敢想敢说敢做的原则，决心试用扩大式复击混凝土或钢筋混凝土灌注桩，试验大型新式深层密打砂桩，并且改进从前资本主义社会遗留下来，有长久历史性的，那些桩基设计和沉陷处理方法。这些先进的革新的基础设计和施工方法，都是上海市以及全中国工程师们未曾想过说过做过。我们一定要掀起一番轰轰烈烈的技术大革命，为一切新型基础开辟道路。
    对于上海市的基础处理方法，究应如何革新，方能既快又好既安全又经济，尚望国内专家们予以深切关怀，提出宝贵意见。
    附录（一）扩大式复击钢筋混凝土或混凝土灌注桩
    根据一九五八年在上钢三厂和沪东造船厂所做的几个现场静荷载试验资料，充分证明了灌注桩经过扩大复击后，其承载能力远远超过单打式。扩大次数愈多，承载能力愈大，惟因进行一根一次扩大的灌注桩只需二小时左右，而进行一根三次扩大的灌注桩共需四小时之久。在此四小时漫长的重复打管灌砼拔管时间中，难免所有施工机具不发生故障，格外拖延时间。为了保证不超过混凝土的初凝时间起见，又必须掺入适当数量的塑化剂予以延长。因此三次扩大的灌注桩虽然它的经济指标是较一次扩大的高得多，但在事实上，施工技术要求甚高，质量很难保证，反不如一次扩大桩之较有把握和值得推广。
    附录（二）
    砂桩
    砂桩做法，共有两种。第一种，是用大距离的浅层砂井，加荷预压一年，排除土壤中的水份，增加土壤的密实度，从而加固地基。第二种，是用小距离的深层密打砂桩，预压一、二个月，将土壤挤实和固结，加速沉陷速度。
    鉴于上海土壤的渗透性很小，土粒水不易排出，同时为了缩短施工期限，并且减少总的沉陷值起见，采用了第二种深层密打砂桩，进行现场试验。试验方法，是选择一个载重二千七百吨六公尺乘九公尺的大柱基，来做大面积群桩的巨型砂桩试压，并将砂桩本身预先加固。砂桩长度为十五公尺，到达地基等压线0.2P的分布深度。对于重型基础，再将百分之四十砂桩向下延伸百分之十，到达地基等压线0.1P的分布深度，做成砂井，以加速沉陷速度。上做一公尺厚的砂垫层。砂桩中距为一点五至二点五倍桩的直径，桩数约为三百根，按等边三角形均匀分布在整个基础下，桩的平均直径为四十四公分。桩管系用震动式灌注桩打桩机夯打，但在管脚改装活瓣开启式管靴，拔管时自动开启，打入时自动关闭。计需初击一次，复击二次，外面用细砂，里面用粗砂，以收倒滤之效，第二次复击只到达砂垫层底面为止，以便灌砂垫层，打桩管方向，系由外向内，成螺旋形。砂桩的总体积占整个地基加固范围的百分之三十左右。
    为了加强吸水作用，桩管打入土中后，先将管内灌满生石灰包，然后拔起桩管，用木桩复击，将石灰包挤到砂桩四周的土壤内，再灌砂子。
    在基础底下做深而密的砂桩及砂垫层，将土壤加固后，就有一层很厚的持力土层，其效果与打很长的钢筋混凝土桩相似，但它的造价要比长钢筋混凝土桩为低，并且所消耗的材料仅是砂子，耗砂量也与长钢筋混凝土桩相差不多。
    附录（三）一般桩基（革新的）
    当地面下较硬土层不深，并且有足够厚度时，可将桩尖穿过弱土，打入这种较硬土层内，尽量依靠桩端支承力，而少用桩周摩擦力，这样所用的桩长既不太大，而沉陷量也小了。
    当地面下较硬土层甚深时，当然利用近代科学技术可以夯打任何长度的桩，但如欲将桩尖打入此项硬层内，则桩长太大，不但需要很多的材料，尤其是打桩的困难激增，造价过贵，工期延长，违背多快好省总的原则。此时与其采用较长的桩子来减少沉陷量，不如采用较短的桩子，全靠桩打入土壤后在桩周侧面所增强的摩阻力来承受荷载，而对沉陷或不均匀沉陷所给与建筑物的偏差则加以适当地调整。
    但是打钢筋混凝土短桩，也必须有足够的长度，应使：
    1．建筑物没有很大的变形而能保证稳定。
    2．基底土壤不致因受挤滑而隆起。
    更进一步来讲，倘若离地面不远找不到一层较硬的土层时，与其打短摩擦桩，不如打砂桩，砂桩间距小，等于在加固范围内将坏土换成好砂，提高压缩模量，减少沉陷量，并因压缩模量比较均匀，不会产生不均匀沉陷。
    上海土壤，除在某些区域有一层较硬厚土层外，一般都是松软饱和淤泥质，问题不在于找到一层较硬的厚土层来支承刚性桩尖，而是要找出措施，以便在控制的沉陷量下，来安全使用建筑物，若同时考虑结构物的使用和基础桩的沉陷，则虽有较大的沉陷量也是允许的。表1．震动式单打和复击灌注桩的静荷载试验资料
