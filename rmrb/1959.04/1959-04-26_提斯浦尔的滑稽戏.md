Title: The Farce in Tezpur

    The thunderclap of a counterattack on the Tibetan Plateau,
    The dream of "'independence'" suddenly bursts.
    Here, "a pool of spring water is wrinkled by the breeze,"
    There, the "enthusiastic" fisherman
    Wants to "fish in troubled waters."
    A treasure from beyond the sky actually falls into their hands,
    A bird in a cage, meat on a chopping block, at their disposal.
    Several discussions, several affectations,
    A carefully rehearsed farce finally comes out,
    Still afraid the actors are clumsy,
    The prompter behind the scenes runs to the front.
    Clumsy directing techniques,
    Disgusting lyrics,
    Singing the tune of "Tibetan independence,"
    Also picking up the spit of British gentlemen.
    Not to mention the monstrous lies,
    Reversing black and white,
    With remarkably many loopholes.
    Just look at the structure of the script,
    A second-rate word game;
    The Tibetan actor's singing,
    Sounds like a foreign flavor.
    The ghostwriter panicked,
    Even forgetting the elementary English grammar,
    "I" and "he" are actually inverted,
    Adding a "correction" at the end,
    Only makes it worse,
    The joke has spread far and wide.
    The so-called masterpiece "Dalai Lama's Statement"
    Turns out to be nothing more than this!
    Although the gentlemen across the ocean cheer loudly,
    The gloating clowns are desperately echoing,
    Everyone with clear eyes sees through this trick.
    Righteous condemnation,
    A scornful laugh
    Echoes even more loudly in our solemn Hall of Benevolence!
    "This is not the real Dalai singing solo,
    This is the clumsy writing of many fake Dalai,"
    Someone ruthlessly exposed the peepshow,
    It's laughable how ineffective the impostor is,
    No matter how you cover it up,
    You can't hide the foul smell.
    Some even sharply question,
    Why "sympathize" with that small group of jackals?
    Is this what you call "kindness"?
    Why scold friends, hurt neighbors, so rampant?
    Has the Panchsheel changed?
    Is lndi Chini baibai
    (Hindi for "India-China friendship") also thrown into the Indian Ocean?
    Still others are sarcastically mocking
    That hypocrite's wishful thinking.
    Your feet are not yet steady, yet your hands reach too far.
    You have only been free from the shackles of slavery for a few years,
    Why do your greedy eyes
    Also fix on our plateau?
    This is exactly "once the sore heals, the pain is forgotten,"
    The new rich are inevitably forgetful!
    Be more sober,
    "Smart people" still need to know what's what.
    You have already stepped on the edge of a cliff,
    Don't play tricks in front of the Chinese giant again.
    Could it be that "a leaf obscures the eye, unable to recognize Mount Tai,"
    That you've turned the calendar wrong,
    Identified the wind direction incorrectly,
    And completely overestimate yourself!?
    It's pitiful that you cling to the dirty legacy of the British,
    "Not getting the mutton and covered in wool,"
    It's not even worth a dream of Nanke!

    提斯浦尔的滑稽戏
    思慕
    西藏高原一声反击的迅雷，
    “‘独立’的迷梦”突然告吹。
    这边“吹绉了一池春水”，
    那边的“热心”渔翁
    却要来个“混水摸鱼”。
    天外飞来的异宝居然到手，
    笼中鸟、俎上肉，听任安排。
    几番商量，几番作态，
    煞费苦心的滑稽戏总算排练出来，
    还怕剧中人笨手笨脚，
    幕后的戏提调却跑出前台。
    拙劣的导演手法，
    恶心的唱词，
    唱的“西藏独立”的调调儿，
    也是捡了英国绅士的唾沫。
    更不要说弥天大谎
    黑白颠倒，
    漏洞儿多得出奇。
    就说台词的结构吧，
    也是下乘的文字游戏；
    西藏角儿的演唱，
    听起来却是一股洋味。
    捉刀人还慌了手脚，
    连英文的文法初阶也记不起，
    “我”和“他”竟然倒置
    再添上一个“更正”的尾巴，
    也是愈描愈黑，
    笑话儿已经传遍万里。
    所谓“达赖喇嘛声明”的杰作
    原来不过如此！
    尽管大洋彼岸的老爷们高声叫好，
    幸灾乐祸的小丑们也拚命帮腔，
    一切明眼的人都看穿了这鬼花样。
    正义的谴责，
    嗤之以鼻的笑声
    更响彻了我们庄严的怀仁堂！
    “这不是真达赖在独唱，
    这是许许多多假达赖的蹩脚文章”，
    有人无情地拆穿了西洋镜，
    可笑冒牌货太不灵光，
    任凭你遮遮掩掩，
    也盖不住臭气四扬。
    也有人尖锐地责问，
    为什么“同情”那小撮的豺狼？
    是不是这叫做“好心肠”？
    为什么骂朋友，伤邻邦，忒猖狂？
    是不是潘查希拉变了样？
    是不是lndi Chini baibai
    （印语“印中友好”）也扔落印度洋？
    更有人在辛辣地嘲笑
    那伪君子的痴心妄想。
    脚儿站还未稳，手儿伸得太长。
    自己摆脱了奴隶枷锁还没有几年，
    为何贪馋的眼睛
    也盯住我们的高原不放？
    这正是“好了疮疤忘了痛”，
    新贵人未免健忘！
    放清醒一些吧，
    “聪明人”还得识相。
    你已经踏足在悬崖边上，
    不要再在中国巨人面前耍花枪。
    难道真个“一叶障眼，不识泰山”，
    翻错了皇历，
    辨错了风向，
    一点不自量！？
    可怜你死抱住英国佬的肮脏衣钵，
    “羊肉吃不着，惹得一身骚”，
    还比不上南柯梦一场！
