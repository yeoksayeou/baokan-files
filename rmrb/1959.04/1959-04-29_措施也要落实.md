Measures Must Be Implemented
    Lei Runming

    Plans and measures are often an inseparable unity.
    Formulating a plan is only the beginning of the work; the conclusion of the work lies in realizing the predetermined plan. To translate the plan into reality, there must be practical and feasible measures. Therefore, the implementation of measures is the fundamental key to ensuring the realization of the plan.
    How to ensure the implementation of measures? The most fundamental approach is to boldly mobilize the masses, disclose the bottom line to the masses, entrust the tasks to the masses, and also hand over the favorable conditions and difficulties in completing the tasks to the masses. Adopt the method of combining leadership with the masses, carry out extensive airing of views, big debates, and write big-character posters to jointly propose measures, evaluate measures, and even implement measures. This kind of measure, which arises from practice, has a full mass base, can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and through the practice of the masses, can continuously inspect, adjust, improve, or enrich the content of the measures. Coming from the masses and going to the masses, this fundamentally ensures that the measures are implemented and the plan is realized. It does not fall on any illusory subjective fantasies, but on the masters who create things—the producers. The greatest feature of the "Five Fixes" proposed by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company is that it grasps the decisive link of mobilizing the masses and implements the combination of leadership and the masses. Therefore, the "Five Fixes" shines brightly, with projects, technical plans, progress schedules, specific responsible persons, and clear objectives and requirements—inspection and summary of effects. All of these can only be fully realized on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses.
    The second quarter is a decisive quarter in industrial production. To seize a decisive victory, we must seize this decisive quarter. Now the production plans of various factories and mining enterprises have been set, and measures have also been taken. The key issue is whether they are implemented. The implementation of the plan depends on the implementation of the measures. Whether it falls on abstract concepts or on the masses is an important criterion for testing whether the measures are implemented, and it is also an important criterion for testing whether this quarter has been truly seized in production.

    措施也要落实
    雷润明
    计划和措施，常常是不可分开的统一体。
    订计划只是工作的开始，工作的终结在于实现预订的计划。要使计划付诸实现就要有切实可行的措施。所以措施落实，是保证计划实现的根本关键。
    怎样使措施落实？最根本的做法是放手发动群众，向群众交底，把任务交给群众，把完成任务的有利条件和困难也交给群众，采用领导和群众相结合的办法，大鸣大放大辩论，贴大字报，来共同提措施，鉴定措施，以至实现措施。这种从实际中产生的措施，具有充分的群众基础，可以充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，并且通过群众的实践，可以不断地检查、调整、提高或丰富措施的内容。从群众中来，到群众中去，这就在根本上使措施落了实，计划落了实。它不是落在任何虚无缥渺的主观幻想上，而是落在创造事物的主人——生产者的身上。石景山钢铁公司所提出的“五定”，最大的特点，就是它抓住了发动群众这个有决定性的环节，并且实行领导和群众相结合，因此使“五定”放出异彩，有项目，有技术方案，有进度表，有具体负责人，有明确的目的和要求—对效果的检查和总结。所有这些，也只有在充分发动群众的基础上，才能圆满实现。
    第二季度是工业生产上的一个决定性的季度，要夺取决定性的胜利，就必须抓紧这个决定性的季度。现在各厂矿企业的生产计划已经定了，措施也有了，关键问题是是否落实。计划的落实有赖于措施的落实，是落在抽象的概念上还是落在群众身上，是检验措施落实与否的一个重要标准，也是检验在生产上是否真正抓紧了这个季度的一个重要标准。
