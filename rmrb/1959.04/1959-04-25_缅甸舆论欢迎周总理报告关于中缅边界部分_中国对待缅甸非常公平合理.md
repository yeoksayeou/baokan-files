But efforts are currently underway to resolve this issue." The newspaper said, "We can also accept Premier Zhou's statement that the status quo should be maintained until the issue is resolved." The newspaper pointed out, "Continuing to recognize the only border that has always been used is a good basis for peace.

    缅甸舆论欢迎周总理报告关于中缅边界部分
    中国对待缅甸非常公平合理
    新华社仰光23日电　有影响的仰光报纸热烈欢迎周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会的报告中关于中缅边界问题的部分。
    “缅甸新光报”在22日发表社论说，周恩来总理关于中缅边界问题所说的话“同缅甸的态度是一致的”。
    “缅甸新光报”指出，“我们知道有些人正在设法利用某些地方划界尚未完成的情况来损害中缅的融洽关系。但是目前正在进行努力，以使这个问题得到解决”。这家报纸说，“周总理说，这个问题在未解决前应当维持现状，对此我们也是能够接受的”。这家报纸指出，“目前继续承认曾被一直使用的唯一的边界是和平的良好基础。而且这也会为和平地耐心地解决边界问题创造有利的形势”。
    “仰光日报”在今天的社论中指出：“必须说，周总理的报告对缅甸是非常公平合理的”。
    这家报纸又说，“直到现在中缅边界问题尚未解决，这是事实。然而，虽然我国内政方面仍然存在混乱状态，但是人民中国的政府并没有做出看来很仓促和使缅甸感到为难的任何事情”。
