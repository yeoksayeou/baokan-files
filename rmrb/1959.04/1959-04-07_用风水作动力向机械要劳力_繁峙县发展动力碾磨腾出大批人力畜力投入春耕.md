From our correspondent in Taiyuan, April 6th: The people of Fanshi County, Shanxi Province, based on the local natural characteristics of strong winds and abundant water, are vigorously developing wind and water-powered milling machines according to local conditions. They are also comprehensively utilizing agricultural irrigation machinery on a large scale, enabling more than 70% of the county's population to have their food processed by powered milling. This has freed up a large number of human and animal laborers, who have been投入 to spring production.

After the county's communization last year, the CCP Fanshi County Committee organized forces to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the use of labor throughout the county. The investigation found that solving the problem of food processing for the county's 280,000 people required more than 2,100 laborers and 1,650 head of livestock every day to push mills and grind grain. Moreover, due to the old and cumbersome processing tools and low efficiency, the waste of labor and livestock was very serious, which affected agricultural production. During the investigation, the County Committee also discovered that the Zaolin, Xingao, and Daying People's Communes in the county had effectively overcome the shortage of labor by adapting to local conditions, making full use of wind and water power, and comprehensively utilizing the power of agricultural irrigation machinery for grain processing. The Xingao People's Commune installed fourteen water mills and water-powered grinders, milling more than 26,000 jin of rice and flour every day, basically solving the food processing problem for the commune's 29,000 people. In the past, a total of 870 laborers and livestock were engaged in pushing mills and grinding grain, but now only 50 laborers are needed to solve the problem completely. The Daying People's Commune installed 27 wind-powered mills. These wind-powered mills are simple to manufacture, require little investment, and are easy to use, and very efficient. They only added a fan and a wooden shaft to the old stone mill, costing only over 90 yuan. With a wind force of three or four, each mill can grind 70 jin of flour per hour, increasing efficiency more than tenfold compared to the old mills. After these wind-powered mills were put into production, the food grain for nearly 29,000 people in the whole commune was processed entirely by wind power. In the past, the work that required 200 laborers and 150 head of livestock every day is now done by 60 people. The Zaolin People's Commune made comprehensive use of all 20 diesel engines, locomotive boilers, and gas engines, using them for pumping water for irrigation during busy farming seasons and for processing grain during slack seasons. This enabled all 23 grinders in the commune to be powered, processing 35,880 jin of grain every day, with a working efficiency four times higher than in the past. The total amount of food grain that the commune needs to process in a year is 6.8 million jin, which can be completely processed in just 190 days, saving a total of more than 68,000 labor days.

After analysis and research, the CCP Fanshi County Committee believed that promoting these experiences throughout the county was an important measure to solve the problem of labor shortage in this year's great leap forward in agricultural production. The County Committee then issued the call to the people of the county to "demand power from wind, water, and fire, and demand labor from tools," and successively held on-site meetings in these three communes to fully exchange experiences. After investigation and research, and according to the different natural conditions in various places, specific plans were made. The Daying, Shahe, and Shanhui communes focused on the development of wind-powered grinders and mills; the Xingao, Shentang, Yangmingbu, and Tanshang communes focused on the development of water-powered grinders and mills; and the Zaolin, Chengguan, and Daicheng communes focused on the comprehensive utilization of power machinery. Typical models were cultivated and comprehensively promoted. In order to solve the problems of insufficient technical force and lack of materials, the County Committee also specially held technical training classes, helping each commune to train 316 technical experts. At the same time, 19 cadres with higher technical levels were drawn to go to various places to provide guidance, thus enabling the county to basically realize the power-driven of milling quickly. At present, a total of 165 mechanical power mills, water-powered grinders, and wind-powered mills have been installed in the county, averaging 1,200 jin of flour milled per unit per day, and nearly 200,000 jin of flour can be milled every day. The problem of food processing for 70% of the county's population has been solved. The work that used to require more than 2,100 laborers and 1,650 livestock every day is now completely replaced by 616 people. This has freed up more than 1,500 laborers and 1,650 livestock to投入 into spring plowing production, and the current problem of labor shortage has also been solved easily.

### 用风水作动力向机械要劳力  繁峙县发展动力碾磨腾出大批人力畜力投入春耕

    用风水作动力向机械要劳力
    繁峙县发展动力碾磨腾出大批人力畜力投入春耕
    本报太原6日电　山西省繁峙县人民根据当地风大、水多的自然特点，因地制宜地大力发展风力、水力带动的动力碾磨，并且大量综合利用农业灌溉机械，使全县70％以上人口的食粮加工实现了碾磨动力化。腾出了大批的人力和畜力，投入了春耕生产。
    中共繁峙县委，在去年全县实现公社化以后，即组织力量深入农村，对全县劳动力的使用情况进行了全面的考察。考察中发现：因解决全县二十八万人口的吃粮加工问题，每天即需要有二千一百多个劳动力和一千六百五十多头牲口推碾、拉磨，而且由于加工工具古老笨重，效率低，浪费劳畜力的现象很严重，因而影响了农业生产。县委在考察中也发现该县枣林、新高、大营三个人民公社，因地制宜地充分利用风力、水力以及综合利用农业灌溉机械的动力进行粮食加工、克服了劳力不足的办法和经验。新高人民公社安装起水磨、水碾十四台，每天碾米磨面粉二万六千多斤，基本上解决了全公社二万九千多人口食粮加工的问题。过去从事推碾拉磨的劳力和畜力共八百七十多个，现在只要五十个劳力就全部解决了问题。大营人民公社安装了二十七台风力磨。这种风力磨制造简单，投资很少，使用方便，而且效率很高。他们只在旧石磨的基础上，加一个风扇和一根木轴，只花九十多元。有三、四级的风力，每小时每台磨可磨面粉七十斤，比旧磨提高了效率十倍多。这些风力磨在投入生产后，全社近二万九千口人的食粮，全部用风力加工。过去每天需要二百个劳力，一百五十头牲口做的活，现在有六十人就做好了。枣林人民公社把二十部柴油机、锅驼机和煤气机全部综合利用，农忙时抽水浇地，农闲时加工粮食，使全社二十三台碾磨全部实现了动力化，这样每天加工粮食三万五千八百八十斤，工作效率比过去提高了四倍。全社一年需要加工的食粮共六百八十万斤，仅在一百九十天内即可全部加工完。共可节省劳动日六万八千多个。
    中共繁峙县委经过分析研究，认为在全县推广这些经验是解决今年农业生产大跃进中劳动力不足问题的重要措施。县委便向全县人民发出了“向风、水、火要动力，向工具要劳力”的号召，先后在这三个公社召开了现场会议，充分交流了经验。并且经过调查研究，按照各地不同的自然条件，具体规划出了大营、沙河、山会等公社以发展风力碾、磨为重点；新高、神堂、阳明堡、滩上等公社发展水力碾磨为主；枣林、城关、代城等公社以综合利用动力机械为主，培养典型，全面推广。为了解决技术力量不足和材料缺乏的问题，县委还专门举办了技术训练班，帮助各公社培养出了三百一十六名技术能手，同时，抽出了十九名技术水平较高的干部深入各地巡回指导，从而使全县很快基本实现了碾磨动力化。目前，全县已经安装好机械动力磨、水力碾、风力磨共一百六十五台，每天每台平均碾磨面粉一千二百斤，每天共可磨粉近二十万斤，全县70％的人口吃粮加工问题解决了。过去每天需要二千一百多个劳力和一千六百五十个畜力作的工作，如今被六百一十六人全部代替了。这样就腾出了一千五百多个劳动力和一千六百五十多头牲畜投入了春耕生产，当前劳动力不足的问题也迎刃而解。
