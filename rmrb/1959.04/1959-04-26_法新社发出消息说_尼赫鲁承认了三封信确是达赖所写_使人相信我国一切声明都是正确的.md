Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: A dispatch from New Delhi by Agence France-Presse on the 24th stated that a noteworthy point of the meeting between the Dalai Lama and Indian Prime Minister Nehru in Mussoorie today was the revelation that the letters published in Beijing, purportedly written by the Dalai Lama to the Chinese Commander in Lhasa (referring to the three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan, acting representative of the central government in Tibet and political commissar of the Tibet Military Region – Editor), are authentic.

Not long ago, Nehru had politely and explicitly expressed doubt about the authenticity of these letters at a press conference. Tonight, however, the Indian Prime Minister said that the Dalai Lama did indeed write these letters, explaining that he did so to “get through a difficult period” and avoid aggravating the situation. The issue of these letters has been the only major enigma concerning his attitude since the Dalai Lama issued his Tezpur statement.

Now that the situation has been clarified and the letters are found to be genuine, the Beijing authorities can claim an easy victory. The most serious aspect of this issue is that, as a result, many will believe that all statements made by Beijing on the Tibetan issue are also correct.

Even the Indian communists, who were recently abused in Parliament, will achieve an easy victory on the issue of these letters. This is a serious problem because it will give the Beijing government an apparent advantage. The difficult situation caused by the Dalai Lama's arrival in India and the Indian government's granting of asylum has become an even more delicate situation for the New Delhi government in its relations with the Beijing government.

The Dalai Lama entered Indian territory on March 31. It is almost unbelievable that Nehru had not learned that these letters were genuine in the twenty-four days since then; it is also almost unbelievable that he would not have disclosed this if he had known.

One foreign diplomat here said tonight that the news that these letters are genuine will be a major blow to Nehru's prestige throughout Asia, and possibly even beyond.

Apart from the revelation that these letters are genuine, the long-awaited meeting between Nehru and the Dalai Lama ended another chapter in this particular event, which has captured the world's attention for so long.

This morning, Nehru made an honest response to Communist China's claim that the Dalai Lama is not free in India. He said that India's door is open, and China can send envoys or the Panchen Lama himself to see if the Dalai Lama is free.

Tonight's revelation about these letters is a setback to Nehru's earlier stance.

### 法新社发出消息说  尼赫鲁承认了三封信确是达赖所写  使人相信我国一切声明都是正确的

    法新社发出消息说
    尼赫鲁承认了三封信确是达赖所写
    使人相信我国一切声明都是正确的
    新华社25日讯　法新社24日从新德里发出的一条消息说，达赖喇嘛和印度总理尼赫鲁今天在穆索里的会谈引人注意的要点是透露了这样的事情：在北京发表的据说是达赖喇嘛写给中国驻拉萨司令官的信件（按指达赖喇嘛给中央驻藏代理代表、西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军的三封信——新华社编者）是真实的。
    尼赫鲁在不久以前的一次记者招待会上曾客气而明确地对这些信的真实性表示了怀疑。而今晚印度总理说，达赖喇嘛确实写了这些信，并且解释说，他这样做是为了“渡过一个困难的时期”，和避免使局势恶化。这些信件问题一直是在达赖喇嘛发表提斯浦尔声明后关于他的态度的唯一的大谜。
    由于情况已经得到澄清，发现这些信是真实的，北京当局能够宣称取得了一个轻而易举的胜利。这个问题的最严重的方面是，结果，许多人将相信北京就西藏问题发表的一切声明也是正确的。
    就在最近在议会中受到辱骂的印度共产党人，也将在这些信件问题上取得轻而易举的胜利。这是一个严重的问题，因为它将使北京政府取得显然的优势。由于达赖喇嘛到达印度和印度政府给予他避难权所引起的难办的局势，对新德里政府来说，在它同北京政府的关系中已成为一个甚至更微妙的局面。
    达赖喇嘛在3月31日进入了印度领土，几乎难以相信，自从那时以来的二十四天中，尼赫鲁没有获悉这些信是真实的；也几乎难以相信，如果他知道的话，他竟没有发表。
    这里的一位外国外交人士今晚说，关于这些信是真实的消息，对尼赫鲁在全亚洲，甚至可能在亚洲以外地方的威信，将是个重大的打击。
    除了透露这些信件是真实的这个事件外，期待已久的尼赫鲁和达赖喇嘛的会谈结束了在这个特殊事件上的另一页，这个事件曾使世界注意了如此之久。
    今天上午，尼赫鲁对共产党中国关于达赖喇嘛在印度不自由的说法作了一个光明正大的答复。他说，印度的门是敞开的，中国可以派遣使者或者班禅喇嘛本人来看看达赖喇嘛是否是自由的。
    今晚关于这些信件的透露，对于尼赫鲁早些时候的姿态是一种挫折。
