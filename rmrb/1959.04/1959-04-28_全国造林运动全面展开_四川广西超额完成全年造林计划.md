National Afforestation Campaign Unfolds Comprehensively
    Sichuan and Guangxi Exceed Annual Afforestation Plans

    (Our newspaper reports) As of mid-April, the national afforestation area has reached over 230 million mu, with 26.5 billion trees planted around houses and villages, and over 2.18 million mu of nurseries cultivated. Among these, Sichuan and Guangxi have both exceeded their annual afforestation plans, taking the lead nationwide.

    The afforestation movement in the northern provinces is gradually entering its climax. In Hebei Province, the afforestation movement is rapidly unfolding throughout the province, with six counties including Zhengding and Gaoyang having already exceeded their annual plans. Shaanxi Province launched a province-wide mass tree-planting blitz week, with 500,000 people participating in the afforestation movement daily. Currently, four counties including Lantian and Dali have completed their annual plans. Gansu, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions have also convened mass rallies to "Advance on the Barren Mountains" and "Advance on the Deserts," and the mass afforestation movement has already begun.

    In the vast areas where agricultural work has already begun, methods such as large-scale movements combined with small-scale movements, large central areas combined with small central areas, large corps afforestation combined with professional team management, as well as "seizing every opportunity" and short-term blitzes, have been used to cleverly arrange the labor force and time for afforestation. In Tao'an County, Jilin Province, under the personal leadership of the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, labor was concentrated before spring ploughing and sowing to carry out a blitz. In just three days, more than 110,000 mu of trees were planted, exceeding the spring afforestation plan. Since the beginning of spring in Shandong Province, the whole province has been fiercely attacking the key period for wheat returning to green, and the labor force is tight. However, the masses in Qihe County, due to the adoption of the method of "large-scale blitz when time is available, small-scale planting when little time is available," have planted trees on all 75 li of the Yellow River dyke within the county. Cang County, Hebei, adopted the method of secretaries taking command, cadres taking the lead, and using large corps operations, organizing more than 20,000 people including the masses, cadres, teachers and students, workers, and soldiers. After three days of preparation, seven days of blitz, and two days of finishing work, all 294 li of the Jinpu Railway and the four main roads including the Cang River within the county were planted with trees.

    In order to improve the quality of afforestation, general areas have implemented the six basic measures of afforestation, established a production responsibility system, strengthened the inspection of afforestation quality, and launched a movement for rapid and high-yielding forestry.

    全国造林运动全面展开
    四川广西超额完成全年造林计划
    本报讯　截至4月中旬，全国造林面积已达两亿三千多万亩、四旁植树二百六十五亿株、育苗二百一十八万多亩。其中四川、广西造林面积，均超额完成全年计划，跃居全国首位。
    北方各省造林运动正逐步进入高潮。河北省的造林运动正在全省迅速展开，正定、高阳等六县已超额完成全年计划。陕西省开展了全民性的植树造林突击周、全省每天有五十万人投入造林运动，现有兰田、大荔等四县已完成全年计划。甘肃、新疆、内蒙古等省区也都分别召开了“向荒山进军”“向沙漠进军”的群众誓师大会，群众性的造林运动已经开始。
    在农忙已经开始的广大地区，运用了大运动套小运动，大中心结合小中心，大兵团造林与专业队经营相结合，以及“见缝插针”，短期突击等办法，对造林的劳力和时间进行了巧安排。吉林省洮安县在县委第一书记亲自领导下，于春耕播种前集中劳力、开展突击，仅三天时间就造林十一万多亩，超额完成春季造林计划。山东省入春以后，全省猛攻小麦返青关，劳力紧张，但齐河县群众由于采用了“大空突击，小空小植”的办法，已将全县境内七十五华里的黄河大堤全部栽上了树。河北沧县采取书记挂帅、干部带头、用大兵团作战方法，组织广大群众、干部、师生、职工、官兵二万多人，经过三天准备，七天突击，两天扫尾，将全县境内长达二百九十四华里的津浦铁路和沧河等四条主要公路两侧全部栽上了树。
    为了提高造林质量，一般地区都贯彻了造林六项基本措施，建立了生产责任制度和加强了造林质量检查，并开展了林木速生丰产运动。（附图片）
