Several Measures for Large-Scale High-Yield Corn Production
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

　　In 1958, China achieved large-scale high-yield corn production, with total output reaching approximately 90 billion catties, more than double the total output of 1957. The unit area yield in 1958 reached approximately 375 catties per mu, nearly double that of 1957, and many counties and townships with a yield of 1,000 catties per mu emerged. The experience gained in achieving large-scale yield increases is very rich.

　　Deepen the plowing layer and apply fertilizer in stages.

　　In the past, many scientific workers believed that the plowing layer could only be deepened by about one inch each year, and that a large increase in depth at one time would cause a decrease in yield. However, the fact of the great agricultural harvest in 1958 overturned this argument. Many areas have achieved significant yield increases by using a subsoil plow or a shovel to deepen the plowing layer to more than one foot, based on a plowing depth of about six inches. For example, in Peiguang Agricultural Cooperative in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, corn planted on land with the same cultivation conditions yielded 1,100 catties per mu with a plant height of eight feet nine inches after being plowed one and a half feet deep, while land plowed six to seven inches deep yielded 700 catties per mu with a plant height of only four to five feet. Another example is the result of a comparison of deep plowing of corn in the Hongqi People's Commune in Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, where deep plowing of one foot two inches increased yield by 61% compared to deep plowing of five inches.

　　The practice of large-scale high-yield production in 1958 proves that corn yielding more than 1,000 catties per mu generally requires more than 20,000 catties of coarse manure (calculated by converting fine manure to coarse manure).

　　Corn requires more nitrogen fertilizer, but only by simultaneously increasing phosphorus and potassium fertilizers can greater yield increases be obtained when increasing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied. According to the analysis of many high-yield corn materials in 1958, the proportion of phosphorus and potassium in the three fertilizer elements increased compared to the past, breaking the old concept of only focusing on increasing nitrogen fertilizer and neglecting the application of quick-acting phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. According to materials from the Jin Southeast Agricultural Science Research Institute in Shanxi Province, increasing the application of mixed phosphorus and potassium fertilizer increased the yield by 14.8% compared to applying nitrogen fertilizer alone.

　　Many high-yield materials from 1958 show that the broad masses of farmers have used the new fertilization methods of "basal fertilizer as the mainstay, top dressing as a supplement; organic fertilizer as the mainstay, chemical fertilizer as a supplement; basal fertilizer applied early, soil and fertilizer mixed, and applied evenly in layers; top dressing applied in small amounts frequently, and in stages; phosphorus and potassium fertilizer applied early."

　　When applying basal fertilizer, some high-yield corn areas combined deep plowing of the land with layered fertilization, and focused on increasing the amount used in the middle layer. Some high-yield areas also applied granular fertilizers or mixed complete fertilizers containing more nitrogen and phosphorus as seed fertilizer when sowing, which can fully and quickly supply the nutrients needed for the early growth of seedlings.

　　On the basis of increasing the application of basal fertilizer, increasing the application of top dressing in stages can significantly increase corn yield. For example, the small-grain red corn of the Aiguo Cooperative in Baizhuang Township, Linyi County, Shandong Province, applied 4,000 catties of basal fertilizer, and only one top dressing of 100 catties of dry manure yielded 930 catties per mu; two top dressings of 100 catties of dry manure and 1,000 catties of pen manure yielded 1,013 catties per mu; and three top dressings of 100 catties of dry manure, 1,000 catties of pen manure, and 2,000 catties of chicken manure yielded 1,210 catties per mu.

　　Many high-yield fields implement the "three-attack top dressing method" (attacking seedlings, attacking stalks, attacking ears), and some high-yield fields have further implemented the "four-attack" top dressing method of eating small meals frequently:

　　1. Attacking seedlings: Apply well-decomposed manure or a small amount of quick-acting fertilizer around six to seven leaves after thinning seedlings to promote strong seedlings.

　　2. Attacking stalks: Apply quick-acting complete fertilizers containing more nitrogen or potassium, such as dry manure, cake fertilizer, and room soil, when the seedlings are two to three feet tall. Some high-yield areas apply top dressing twice during the jointing stage according to the growth of the corn, to promote strong and sturdy stems and good development of female ears.

　　3. Attacking ears: Apply more nitrogen and phosphorus chemical fertilizers or quick-acting organic fertilizers before the plants tassel, to promote the full development of well-developed female ears.

　　4. Attacking grains: Apply more quick-acting nitrogen and phosphorus chemical fertilizers before and after flowering and pollination. Some high-yield fields also carried out foliar spraying of phosphorus to promote full grain filling.

　　This method of top dressing not only timely supplies the nutrients needed by the plants in each growth stage, but also avoids excessive fertilization at one time, which can cause excessive plant growth, lodging, and loss of fertilizer. This top dressing method is especially important in cases of dense planting and high fertilization.

　　Rational close planting and improved planting methods

　　Under the conditions of fully utilizing land fertility and ensuring good ventilation and light transmission, appropriately increasing the number of plants per unit area and rationally distributing the plants is the central link to increasing corn production.

　　If the density is too high, there is a lack of sunlight, poor ventilation, and although the supply of fertilizer and water is sufficient, the plants cannot grow normally, there are many barren stalks, and the yield is low. For example, the results of a summer corn dense planting experiment conducted by the Shandong Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1958 showed that under good fertilizer and water conditions, medium-maturity corn varieties planted at 666 to 13,332 plants per mu had the highest yield at 5,328 plants per mu, with a wet ear weight of 1,167.6 catties. Starting from 8,000 plants, the greater the density, the more corn plants died and the more barren stalks during the growing period, the thinner the stems, the smaller the ears, and the lower the yield. Among them, planting more than 10,000 plants per mu, although more fertilizer was applied, the yield was still reduced, the barren stalk rate was as high as 20.6%-26%, and the number of plant deaths reached 2,600 to 3,600 plants.

　　In 1958, the broad masses of farmers created many new corn planting methods, such as the large and small ridge method, the double-plant hole sowing method, the wide ridge dense planting method, and so on. In the case of increasing the larger density, these methods are not only convenient for field operations, but also conducive to ventilation and light transmission, thereby ensuring the yield-increasing effect of rational close planting. For example, in several high-yield summer corn fields of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, under the same density, the planting method with equal row spacing and plant spacing for single plants was inconvenient to manage, caused more leaf damage, resulted in weak plant growth, and low yield; while the planting methods of large and small ridges and double-plant hole sowing had larger row spacing, were easy to manage, resulted in stronger plant growth, and higher yield.

　　In 1958, the broad masses of farmers not only effectively used the intercropping method of corn and soybeans, but also expanded the intercropping area of corn and potatoes, sweet potatoes, and so on.

　　Because beans are relatively shade-tolerant, intercropping corn with beans can better give full play to the role of sunlight and land fertility. When corn and soybeans are intercropped, both crops generally grow normally and have higher yields. For intercropping, planting two rows of soybeans consecutively is better than a single row, which is more conducive to ventilation and light transmission.

　　When corn and potatoes are intercropped, potatoes generally grow better and have higher yields because they require lower temperatures and light intensity.

　　When corn and sweet potatoes are intercropped, corn generally grows better, while sweet potatoes are more or less affected; the greater the density of corn, the greater the impact on sweet potatoes.

　　According to past and 1958 experience in rational close planting, under the conditions of ensuring deep plowing, more fertilizer, and more water, and adopting reasonable sowing methods, spring-sown late-maturing varieties are generally planted at 3,000 to 5,000 plants per mu, medium-maturing varieties are planted at 4,000 to 6,000 plants per mu, and summer-sown early-maturing varieties are planted at 5,000 to 8,000 plants per mu, which is a more suitable density for obtaining large-scale high-yield corn production.

　　Watering appropriately and in a timely manner.

　　Corn plants are tall and have large leaves, requiring much more water than crops such as millet and wheat; especially when increasing fertilizer application and in dry weather conditions, more watering is needed. Too much water is also unfavorable. In 1958, the broad masses of farmers mastered the method of light watering and frequent watering, which met the corn's need for water and also avoided excessive stem and leaf growth and plant lodging. Watering should be determined according to the climate, soil, and plant growth conditions, that is, what the masses call "look at the sky, look at the land, look at the crops." According to many high-yield materials in North China, spring-sown corn generally needs three to five waterings to ensure that the plants are supplied with the water they need. The time and amount of watering are roughly carried out in the following stages:

　　1. Base moisture water: In some areas, after deep plowing, a thorough watering is done before freezing to increase the base moisture and promote soil subsidence; in other areas, no watering is done after deep plowing, and the decision is made based on the soil moisture content before sowing; no watering is done if the soil moisture is good, and watering is only done if it is dry. The former watering method has the advantages of breaking up soil clods and avoiding reducing soil temperature and affecting seed germination and seedling emergence by watering before sowing. The amount of base moisture water is generally large.

　　2. Seedling water: The amount of water is small this time. When the soil is dry, it is generally carried out after thinning seedlings; if the soil is moist, the watering time is often delayed or this watering is not done. The purpose is to promote the roots to grow deep downward and make the seedlings grow strong and sturdy.

　　3. Jointing water: This watering is generally used when the seedlings are about two to three feet tall, that is, during the period of rapid stem and leaf growth and female ear differentiation. At this time, the leaf surface evaporation is large, and watering can promote the increase of female ears and the strengthening of stems. Some areas have appropriately increased the number of waterings when the weather is too dry. The amount of jointing water is generally larger than that of seedling water, but it is also necessary to avoid large-scale flooding to prevent excessive plant growth and lodging.

　　4. Tasseling water: This watering is done before tasseling. Because the plants are growing vigorously at this time and the female ears are developing rapidly, a large amount of water is needed, so the amount of watering is large. Watering during this period can ensure that the originally well-differentiated female ears develop fully and prevent the phenomenon of "necking drought" and no tasseling.

　　5. Grain filling water: This watering is carried out during the period from corn pollination to milky maturity, and is advanced or delayed according to the amount of rainfall. Moderate watering has a good effect on full grain filling and increased yield.

　　Use improved varieties and hybrid varieties

　　In the past, the role of varieties was unilaterally exaggerated, and a series of cultivation measures were ignored, which greatly limited the increase in yield. However, under the same conditions of improved cultivation measures, the yield-increasing potential of improved varieties can be better displayed.

　　In 1958, various localities universally adopted improved corn varieties (or hybrid varieties).

　　In many areas of North China, early-maturing varieties were originally planted for summer corn, and the yield was low. In addition to improving cultivation measures, many farmers boldly broke with conventions and adopted medium- and late-maturing high-yielding varieties to give full play to the yield-increasing potential in order to increase production even more.

　　Using the first-generation advantage of corn hybrid varieties is a more effective measure. Compared with improved varieties, hybrid varieties can generally increase yield by 10%-20% or even higher. This has been confirmed in our country's experimental research or production practice. Some agricultural cooperatives have also produced a large number of hybrid seeds (inter-varietal hybrid varieties) on their own land.

　　Double-cross hybrids between inbred lines can increase yield more than inter-varietal hybrid varieties. In addition to being confirmed in domestic and foreign experimental research, good results have also been obtained in production. For example, the results of a comparison in the high-yield field of the Xinxi People's Commune in Puyang County, Henan Province showed that the double-cross hybrid variety (Nongda No. 4) yielded 1,499 catties per mu, exceeding the local best high-yielding variety, Baima Ya, by 267.4 catties, an increase of 21.8%.

　　The above materials show that in agricultural production, the transition from promoting improved varieties to inter-varietal hybrid varieties, and in a short period of time to the comprehensive planting of double-cross hybrid varieties, is an effective measure to ensure the further increase of corn yield.

　　Strengthen field management and prevent diseases and insect pests

　　In 1958, various localities carried out diligent and meticulous management of corn, which played a good role in the comprehensive high yield of corn.

　　1. Sowing at the appropriate time: If spring corn is sown too early, the seeds are prone to mildew and rot, and the seedlings suffer from frost damage, resulting in missing seedlings; if it is too late, the soil moisture is not good, and the emergence of seedlings is delayed, affecting the yield. In 1958, farmers in many areas found the most suitable spring sowing time in their localities, and generally sowed at the appropriate time when the soil temperature was 10 to 12 degrees Celsius. Summer-sown corn should be sown as soon as possible after wheat harvest.

　　Thinning seedlings when corn has three to four leaves and setting seedlings when it has five to six leaves, and then checking and replenishing seedlings after setting seedlings to ensure that all seedlings are strong.

　　2. Removing weeds, loosening the surface soil, and diligently cultivating in combination with fertilizer and water: Top dressing, watering, and cultivating are closely linked measures. In 1958, most areas achieved "cultivating when there is no rain for a long time, and cultivating more when there are more weeds after rain" to ensure that there were no weeds in the field and the soil was loose and the air was flowing.

　　The depth of cultivation is generally carried out according to the rule of shallow-deep-shallow. As the saying goes, "The first cultivation is shallow, the second cultivation is deep, and the roots are not broken after the third cultivation." That is, shallow cultivation after emergence to break the ground to avoid injury to the seedling roots and excessive moisture loss. The second and third cultivations are deeper, about two inches deep, and combined with earthing up. Because the roots are growing deep at this time, deep cultivation will not cause the roots to be injured, and it can also promote the early growth of supporting roots to prevent lodging. Shallow cultivation of about one inch after the fourth time is still important for weeding and loosening the soil surface.

　　3. Removing tillers, treating diseases and insect pests, and artificial pollination for full grain: The tillers of general varieties often do not bear ears, consume nutrients, and affect the normal growth of plants. Many areas have achieved the timely removal of tillers. The tillers of multi-ear varieties can normally bear ears and should not be removed to increase the number of ears.

　　Corn smut disease (commonly known as black mold) is one of the serious diseases that reduce corn production. It can be transmitted by seeds or from soil and air. Many areas have achieved the use of 0.3% Ceresan to mix seeds before sowing to eliminate pathogens on the seeds. In addition, when small milky white lesions are first discovered in the field, they should be immediately peeled off and buried deeply to avoid the spores from spreading out and expanding the damage after maturation.

　　Controlling underground pests is an important measure to ensure the full emergence of corn seedlings. In many areas, 2 to 3 catties of 6% BHC powder or several catties of red alum are mixed into the soil per mu during cultivation, or poisonous grains are applied during sowing, and poisonous baits are sprinkled after emergence to control mole crickets and other underground pests.

　　When the corn seedlings are about three feet tall and the top leaves form a trumpet shape, use 6% wettable BHC diluted with water 500 to 600 times, shake well and irrigate the heart two to three times, which basically eliminates the damage of corn borers. There are also more fundamental control methods, that is, treating straw, ear axes, root stubble, etc. in winter until before the emergence of borer moths.

　　Artificial pollination is one of the successful experiences in reducing bare tips and missing grains in corn. The broad masses of farmers have mastered this measure; when corn is flowering and dispersing pollen, artificial pollination is generally carried out once or twice every two to three days, and a few high-yield areas reach more than three times, which has played a certain role in increasing corn production.

　　Although there are many new experiences in corn production in 1958 that are in line with scientific theory, there are still many problems that have not been resolved. Such as the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in fertilizers and the amount of fertilizer applied to obtain the highest fertilizer efficiency, the quota for dense planting for high yields, the issue of inserting bamboo sticks and treating chemical agents to promote more ears and larger ears, the issue of selecting high-yielding multi-ear varieties, and the issue of atomic energy utilization, and so on. We hope that the broad masses of farmers and scientific workers will work together to conduct more extensive and in-depth research.

　　玉米大面积丰产的几项措施
　　中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    1958年，我国玉米获得大面积丰产，总产量已达九百亿斤左右，比1957年的总产量增加一倍多；单位面积产量，1958年亩产达三百七十五斤左右，较1957年提高接近一倍，而且出现了许多玉米千斤县和千斤乡。获得大面积增产的经验是很丰富的。
    加深耕层，分期施肥
    过去许多科学工作者认为耕层只能逐年加深一寸左右，一次大大加深就会引起减产。但是1958年农业大丰产的事实，把这种论断推翻了。许多地区在耕深六寸左右的基础上，进行套犁或再用铁锨深翻一次，使耕层达到一尺以上，都获得很大的增产效果。例如安徽寿县沛光农业社的玉米，在其他栽培条件相同的土地上，深翻一尺半，株高八尺九寸，每亩产量为一千一百斤，而耕深六至七寸，株高只四至五尺，亩产为七百斤。又如山西高平县红旗人民公社玉米深翻地的对比结果，深耕一尺二寸的比深耕五寸的增产61％。
    1958年大面积丰产的实践证明，亩产千斤以上的玉米，施肥量一般需要粗肥二万斤以上（细肥折为粗肥计算）。
    玉米需氮肥较多，但在增施大量氮肥情况下，只有同时增加磷钾肥料，才可能获得更大的增产效果。根据1958年许多玉米丰产材料的分析，在增施肥料的情况下，肥料三要素中磷钾所占的比例，比以往增加，打破了过去只着重增施氮肥，而忽视施用速效磷钾肥料的陈腐观念。根据山西晋东南农业科学研究所的材料，增施磷钾混合肥的产量比单施氮肥的增产14.8％。
    1958年许多丰产材料表明，广大农民运用了“基肥为主，追肥为辅；有机肥料为主，化学肥料为辅；基肥早施，土肥混合，层层匀施；追肥少吃多餐，分期追施；磷钾肥料早施”的新的施肥方法。
    施用基肥时，有些玉米丰产地结合深翻土地分层施肥，并着重增加了中层的用量。有些丰产地在播种时还施用了含氮、磷较多的颗粒肥料或混合的完全肥料作为种肥，可以充分而迅速地供给幼苗初期生长所需要的养分。
    在增施基肥的基础上，分期增施追肥，更能显著地提高玉米的产量。如山东临沂县白庄乡爱国社的小粒红玉米，同样施基肥四千斤，其中只追一次粪干一百斤的，亩产九百三十斤；追肥二次，追粪干一百斤、圈肥一千斤的亩产一千零十三斤；追肥三次，粪干一百斤、圈粪一千斤，和鸡粪二千斤的亩产一千二百一十斤。
    许多丰产田追肥实行“三攻追肥法”（攻苗、攻秆、攻穗），有些丰产田则更进一步实行了少吃多餐的“四攻”追肥法：
    1、攻苗：定苗后六至七个叶子左右，一般施用腐熟的厩肥或少量速效肥料，促使幼苗健壮。
    2、攻秆：苗高二至三尺左右，施用粪干、饼肥、房土等含氮或钾较多的速效完全肥料；有些丰产地根据玉米生长情况，在拔节期追肥二次，促使茎秆坚硬粗壮，雌穗孕育良好。
    3、攻穗：在植株抽穗前，多施氮磷化学肥料或速效的有机肥料，促使发育好的雌穗充分发展。
    4、攻粒：在开花受粉前后，多追施速效的氮磷化学肥料，有些丰产田还进行了根外喷磷，促使结实饱满。
    这样追肥，不但及时地供应了植株在各生长阶段所需要的养分，而且避免了一次施肥过多，引起植株徒长倒伏和肥分的流失。在密植、多肥的情况下，这种追肥方法尤为重要。
  合理密植，改进种植方式
    在充分利用地力和保证通风透光良好的条件下，适当地增加单位面积株数，合理分布植株，是玉米增产的中心环节。
    密度过高，阳光缺少，通风不良，虽然肥、水供应充足，植株也不能正常生长，空秆多，产量低。例如山东省农业科学研究所1958年夏玉米密植的试验结果，在良好的肥、水条件下，中熟玉米品种每亩种六百六十六至一万三千三百三十二株，以五千三百二十八株的产量最高，湿穗重一千一百六十七点六斤；从八千株开始，密度越大，生长期中玉米植株死亡及空秆越多，茎秆越细，果穗越小，产量越低。其中每亩种植一万株以上的，虽然施肥多，但产量仍然减低，空秆率高达20.6％—26％，植株死亡数达二千六百到三千六百株。
    1958年广大农民创造了许多新的玉米种植方式，如大小垅法、双株穴播法、宽垅密植法等等。在增加较大密度的情况下，这些方式不仅便于田间操作，也有利通风透光，从而保证了合理密植的增产作用。例如中国农业科学院的几块夏玉米丰产田，在同样密度的情况下，单株行距株距相等的种植方式，管理不便，叶片折损较多，植株生长细弱，产量低；而采用大小垅法及双株穴播的种植方式，行距较大，便于管理，植株生长较壮，产量高。
    1958年广大农民不仅有效地运用玉米与大豆间作的方式，而且还扩大了玉米与马铃薯、甘薯等的间作面积。
    由于豆类比较耐阴，玉米与豆类间作，更能充分发挥阳光和地力的作用。玉米、大豆间作，一般两种作物都生长正常，产量较高。间作的方式，大豆连种两行比单行好，更有利于通风透光。
    玉米和马铃薯间作，由于马铃薯要求温度和光的强度较低，一般生长较好，产量也高。
    玉米和甘薯间作，一般玉米生长较好，甘薯或多或少要受到一些影响；玉米的密度越大，甘薯受影响越大。
    根据过去和1958年合理密植的经验，在保证深耕多肥多水的条件下，并采用合理的播种方式时，春播晚熟品种一般亩种三千至五千株，中熟品种亩种四千至六千株，夏播早熟品种亩种五千至八千株，是获得玉米大面积丰产比较合适的密度。
    适时适量浇水
    玉米的株高叶大，需要水分比谷子、小麦等作物要多得多；特别是在增施肥料天气干旱的情况下，更要多浇水。水分过多也是不利的。1958年广大农民掌握了轻浇勤浇的方法，满足了玉米对水分的需要，也避免了茎叶徒长和植株倒伏。浇水应根据气候、土壤和植株生育情况来决定，即群众所谓“看天、看地、看庄稼”。根据华北地区许多丰产材料来看，春播玉米一般浇水三至五次可以保证供给植株所需水分。浇水的时间和水量，大致是按如下的阶段进行：
    1、底墒水：有些地区在深翻后，结冻前透浇一水，增加底墒，促使土壤下沉；也有些地区在深翻后不浇水，到播种前根据墒情决定，墒好不浇，干旱才浇。前一浇水方法有破碎土块和避免播种前浇水减低地温影响种子发芽和幼苗出土的优点。底墒水一般水量较大。
    2、幼苗水：这次水量较小。土壤干旱时，一般在定苗后进行；土壤湿润，则多延迟浇水时期或者不浇这一水。为的是促使根系向下深扎，并使幼苗生长粗壮墩实。
    3、拔节水：这次水一般用在苗高二至三尺左右的时候，即茎叶迅速生长和雌穗分化的时期，这时叶面蒸发量较大，浇水可促使雌穗增多和茎秆粗壮。有些地区在天气过于干旱时，适当增加了浇水次数。拔节水的水量一般比幼苗水大些，但也要避免大水漫浇，防止植株的徒长和倒伏。
    4、抽穗水：这次水在抽穗前浇。由于这时植株生长旺盛，雌穗发育迅速，需要大量水分，所以浇水量较大。在这段时期浇水，可保证原来分化良好的雌穗充分发育，防止“卡脖旱”不抽穗的现象。
    5、灌浆水：这次水在玉米受粉到乳熟期间进行，根据降雨量情况提早或延迟。浇水量适中，对籽粒饱满、增加产量有良好的作用。
  采用优良品种和杂交种
    过去片面地夸大品种作用，忽视了一系列的栽培措施，使得产量的提高受到了很大限制。但是，在栽培措施提高了的相同条件下，优良品种的增产潜力更能显示出来。
    1958年各地都普遍采用了玉米优良品种（或杂交种）。
    华北不少地区夏玉米原种植早熟品种，产量较低。许多农民除改进栽培措施外，为了更多的增产，大胆地打破了陈规，采用了中晚熟丰产品种，发挥了增产潜力。
    利用玉米杂交种第一代的优势，是更有效的措施。与优良品种比较，杂交种一般可增产10％—20％或更高一些。这在我国的试验研究或生产实践上都得到了证实。有些农业社并在自己的土地上生产了大量的杂交种子（品种间杂交种）。
    自交系间的双杂交种比品种间杂交种更能增产，除了在国内外的试验研究上得到证实外，在生产上也获得良好的效果。如河南濮阳县新习人民公社在丰产地上的对比结果，双杂交种（农大四号）亩产一千四百九十九斤，超过当地最好的丰产品种白马牙二百六十七点四斤，增产21.8％。
    上述材料说明，在农业生产上，由推广优良品种过渡到品种间杂交种，并在短期内过渡到全面播种双杂交种，是保证玉米产量进一步提高的有效措施。
    加强田间管理，防治病虫
    1958年各地对玉米作到了勤管理、细管理，对玉米全面丰产起了良好作用。
    1、适期播种：春玉米播种过早，种子容易霉烂，幼苗遭受冻害，造成缺苗；过晚则墒土不好，出苗较迟，影响产量。1958年许多地区农民找出了当地最适宜的春播时期，一般在地温摄氏十至十二度趁墒适时播种。夏播玉米在麦收后越快越好。
    玉米出苗三至四片叶时间苗，五至六片叶时定苗，定苗后还查苗补苗，保证了苗全苗壮。
    2、除杂草，松表土，结合肥水勤中耕：追肥、浇水、中耕是密切结合的三项措施。1958年大都做到“久旱不雨锄，雨后草多锄”，保证田间无杂草，土壤疏松气流通。
    中耕的深浅，一般是按照浅——深——浅的规则进行。俗语说“头遍浅，二遍深，三遍以后不断根”。即出苗后浅中耕，划破地皮，避免了苗根受伤和跑墒过多。第二至三次中耕较深，约二寸多，并结合培土。由于这时根系向深扎，深中耕不致使根系受伤，又可以促使提早长出支持根，防止倒伏。第四次以后浅中耕一寸左右，对除草和疏松地表仍有重要作用。
    3、去分蘖，治病虫，人工授粉粒饱满：一般品种的分蘖常常不结穗，消耗养分，影响植株正常生长，许多地区都做到了及时去除分蘖。多穗品种的分蘖，可以正常结穗，不要去除，以增加果穗的数量。
    玉米黑粉病（俗称乌霉）是使玉米减产的严重病害之一，它可以由种子传染，也可从土壤和空气传染。许多地区做到了在播种前用0.3％的赛力散拌种，消灭种子上的病菌。此外，在田间开始发现乳白色的小病疱时，立即剥除深埋，避免成熟后再散出孢子扩大为害。
    防治地下害虫，是保证玉米全苗的重要措施。许多地区在耕地时就每亩掺土施入6％六六六粉二至三斤或红矾数斤，或在播种时施毒谷，在出苗后撒施毒饵防治蝼蛄等地下害虫。
    玉米苗高三尺左右，顶端叶子形成喇叭口时，用6％可湿性六六六兑水五百至六百倍，摇匀灌心二至三次，基本消灭了玉米螟的为害。还有采用比较根本的防治方法，即在冬季至螟虫羽化前，处理秸秆、穗轴、根茬等。
    人工授粉是使玉米减少秃尖缺粒的成功经验之一。广大农民已掌握了这一措施；当玉米开花散粉时，每隔二至三天普遍进行人工授粉一至二次，少数高额丰产地区达到三次以上，对玉米增产起了一定作用。
    在1958年的玉米生产上虽然有许多符合科学理论的新经验，但也有许多问题目前还没有解决。如肥料中氮磷钾的比例和为了获得最高肥效的施肥数量问题，高额丰产的密植定额问题，玉米插竹签和化学药剂处理促使穗多穗大的问题，选育丰产多穗品种的问题，以及原子能利用问题等等。希望广大农民和科学工作者共同协作，进行更广泛更深入的研究。
