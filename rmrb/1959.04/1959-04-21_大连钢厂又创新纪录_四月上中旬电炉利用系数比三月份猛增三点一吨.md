Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, 20th—The Dalian Steel Plant's electric furnace utilization rate has reached a new record since the plant's opening. From April 1st to 18th, the cold charge utilization rate of electric furnaces averaged 40.495 tons of steel production per kilovolt-ampere per day and night, a sharp increase of 3.1 tons compared to March, and nearly 4 tons higher than the highest month last year.

In April, the high-speed progress of the Benxi Steel Plant greatly inspired the Dalian Steel Plant, which had won the high-yield red flag. The two plants exchanged production information almost every day. From the 1st to the 12th, the utilization rate of Benxi Steel Plant surged more than eight tons compared to March, a speed three times higher than that of Dalian Steel Plant. When the news arrived, the director of the Dalian Steel Plant went to the steelmaking workshop at midnight on the 13th to hold a mass meeting, announcing to all the workers: "Benxi Steel has stepped on the heels of Dalian Steel, and now the utilization rate is only one ton apart!" These few words stirred the entire audience. The meeting almost couldn't continue. Workers, in groups of three and five, passionately discussed measures to "defend the red flag." The first electric furnace workshop quickly put forward thirty-three measures. The director, workshop director, and branch secretaries also flocked to the electric furnace to inspect the overall production situation, and worked with the workers to study and solve the key problems in improving the utilization rate.

After several days of hard work, the utilization rate of electric furnaces throughout the plant generally increased, averaging 40.495 tons from the 1st to the 18th, creating a new record since the plant was established. At the same time, the qualified rate of steel ingots also reached 99.62, 0.2% higher than the highest quality month of March.

    大连钢厂又创新纪录
    四月上中旬电炉利用系数比三月份猛增三点一吨
    据新华社旅大20日电　大连钢厂的电炉利用系数又出现了开厂以来的最高纪录。4月1日到18日，电炉冷装利用系数每千千伏安一昼夜的产钢量平均达到了四十点四九五吨，比3月份猛增三点一吨，比去年最高月份提高将近四吨。
    4月份，本溪钢厂的高速度进步，对获得高产红旗的大连钢厂起了很大的激励作用。两厂几乎每天都在交流生产情报。1日到12日，本溪钢厂的利用系数比3月份猛增了八吨多，速度高于大连钢厂三倍。消息传来，大连钢厂厂长在13日半夜就到炼钢车间召开大会，向全体工人宣布：“本钢踩到了大钢脚后跟，现在利用系数仅有一吨之差了！”三两句话，全场激动。大会几乎开不下去。工人们三五成群，激昂地讨论着“保卫红旗”的措施。第一电炉车间很快就提出了三十三条。厂长、车间主任、支部书记们，也一同涌到电炉旁边巡视总的生产情况，跟工人一起研究解决提高利用系数的关键问题。
    经过几天的奋战，全厂电炉的利用系数普遍上升，1日到18日平均达到四十点四九五吨，创造了开厂以来的新纪录。同时，钢锭的合格率也达到了九十九点六二，比质量最高的3月份高出0.2％。
