Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: The Hungarian Revolutionary Art Exhibition opened this morning at the Wenhua Hall of the Palace Museum in Beijing. The exhibition is jointly organized by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association to celebrate the 14th anniversary of Hungary's liberation (April 4th).

The exhibition features more than 200 oil paintings and prints by dozens of famous modern Hungarian painters. Many excellent works deeply reflect the heroic struggles and lofty revolutionary spirit of the Hungarian people over the past century with brushstrokes full of strong national characteristics.

Among the oil paintings on display are original works such as "The Strike" and "Rural Hero" by Mihály Munkácsy, the great Hungarian realist painter of the 19th century. This world-renowned master painter, in his works, used unique artistic techniques to create typical characters, vividly expressing the heroic image of revolutionaries and the spirit of resistance of the oppressed working people.

Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Chairman of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Hungarian Ambassador to China Nogradi, diplomatic envoys and officials of various socialist brother countries, directors of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association in Beijing, famous painters and representatives of art circles in the capital attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition today. Zhang Zhixiang first delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, saying that the exhibition once again shows that the fraternal friendship between China and Hungary, forged in the revolutionary struggle, is growing day by day.

Ambassador Nogradi said in his speech that this exhibition not only marks the development of cultural relations between Hungary and China, but also allows the people of the two countries to have the opportunity to further understand each other, which helps to further strengthen the deep friendship between the people of the two countries. He also said that the progressiveness and revolutionary spirit of Hungarian art are part of the national characteristics of Hungarian art. The best tradition in Hungarian cultural history is that many painters, sketch artists, and sculptors directly participated in the struggle of our people for freedom with their works. Ambassador Nogradi concluded by warmly congratulating the successful opening of the exhibition.

After being exhibited in Beijing for three weeks, all exhibits will be moved to Shanghai for exhibition.

    为庆祝匈牙利解放十四周年
    匈艺术展览会在京开幕
    据新华社2日讯　匈牙利革命艺术展览会今天上午在北京故宫文华殿开幕。展览会是我国对外文化联络委员会和中匈友好协会为庆祝匈牙利解放十四周年（4月4日）而联合举办的。
    展览会展出了匈牙利几十位近代著名画家的二百多幅油画和版画。许多优秀作品以富有浓厚民族特色的画笔，深刻地反映了匈牙利人民百年来的英勇斗争和崇高的革命精神。
    在展出的油画中，有十九世纪匈牙利伟大的现实主义画家蒙卡契·米哈伊的“罢工”、“农村英雄”等原作，这位世界闻名的大画家，在他的作品中以独特的艺术技巧创造出来的典型人物，非常生动地表现了革命者的英雄形象和受压迫的劳动人民的反抗精神。
    我国对外文委副主任张致祥、匈牙利驻华大使诺格拉第、各社会主义兄弟国家的驻华使节和外交官员、在北京的中匈友好协会理事、首都著名画家和艺术界代表人士，都出席了今天的展览会开幕式。张致祥首先在开幕式上致词说，这个展览会的展出，再一次表明中匈两国在革命斗争中结成的兄弟友谊正与日俱增。
    诺格拉第大使在讲话中说，这个展览会不仅标志着匈中两国文化关系的发展，而且可以让两国人民有机会更进一步地相互了解，有助于更进一步加强两国人民的深厚友谊。他还说，匈牙利艺术的进步性及其革命精神，是匈牙利艺术的民族特点的一部分。匈牙利文化史上最优秀的传统就是很多画家、素描家、雕塑家以自己的作品，直接参加了我国人民为自由而进行的斗争。诺格拉第大使最后热情地祝贺展览会展出工作获得成功。
    这个展览会在北京展出三个星期后，全部展品还将迁到上海展览。
