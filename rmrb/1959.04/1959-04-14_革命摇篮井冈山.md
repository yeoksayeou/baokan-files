　　Jinggang Mountain, Cradle of the Revolution
　　Xiong Tianjing

　　Jinggang Mountain, the cradle of the revolution, has long held a deep place in people's hearts. Not long ago, we visited Jinggang Mountain. Starting from Taihe, the entire journey was filled with dense forests. In the afternoon, we arrived at Shizikou (Lion's Mouth). This was the inner perimeter base of the Red Army in defending the Jinggang Mountain revolutionary base area, with towering mountains and a strategically important location. Now, thousands of people are building factories here—a paper mill, a power station, and employee residences.

　　Proceeding from Shizikou, another magnificent scene unfolded before us: mountain ridges and deep valleys, everywhere filled with slogans and banners of the Great Leap Forward, some nailed to the cliffs with fir bark, others using gray bricks to form characters from the foot of the mountain to the summit. On each mountain ridge, towering Great Leap Forward gates stood, with Chairman Mao's inscriptions encouraging the old revolutionary base areas written on both sides: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory."

　　At four o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at Ciping, the location of the Jinggang Mountain People's Commune.

　　Ciping is surrounded by mountains and forests, with a flat壩 area of about 500 acres in the middle. There are paddy fields and villages in the壩. Spring is the best season here, with red flowers and green leaves growing everywhere, making for beautiful scenery.

　　Ciping's eastern foothills are close to Nasan in Yongxin County, and its western foothills are close to Shuikou in Ling County. Together with D井, 小井, 中井, 下井, 上井, Caoping, and Baiyin Lake on the mountain, they formed an important base for defending the revolutionary base area. Militarily, it was advantageous for both offense and defense, truly embodying the idea of "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand men cannot break through." The local people once compared it to "Mount Motian," saying, "Even birds find it difficult to cross Jinggang Mountain." After liberation, Jinggang Mountain was once established as a special zone. In 1956, it was changed to Jinggang Mountain Township, under the leadership of Suichuan County. Now, the township and commune have merged, and the Jinggang Mountain People's Commune is still located in Ciping.

　　Ciping is a newly built mountain village and a new type of mountainous city. Walking west from the bus station, large new buildings stand along the mountainside. The streets are filled with the People's Bank, Xinhua Bookstore, Jinggang Mountain Elementary School, Post and Telecommunications Bureau, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Photo Studio, Hospital Outpatient Department, Native Produce Sales Department, Department Store, and Jinggang Mountain Hotel, crowded with bustling crowds day and night. Not far from here is the sanatorium area. The buildings in the sanatorium area are all two-story brick and tile buildings, tall and very beautiful. When you stand on the mountain peak, you can clearly see countless red roofs and blue windows dotted in the green forest. These garden-like villas were all built with government funding in the second half of 1958, and most of the old Red Army revolutionary comrades come here for recuperation.

　　Facing the sanatorium from afar is a labor university under construction, capable of accommodating 800 people. The Jinggang Mountain Auditorium, built under the trees, is very large and can accommodate more than 2,000 people. It serves as both a meeting place and a theater. The new Cultural Center here not only displays cultural relics donated by Jiangxi Province but also mechanical agricultural tools donated by the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, film projectors donated by the Ministry of Culture, books and printing presses donated by the Shanghai Cultural Bureau and Publishing House, generators donated by Sichuan, and radios donated by Hunan. It can truly be said that Jinggang Mountain is supported from all over the motherland.

　　Going further northeast, many factories have been built here, including wineries, wood processing plants, machinery factories, and brick and tile factories, as well as employee dormitories. A very beautiful building is revealed in the depths of the shade, which is the Jinggang Mountain Exchange. The Home for the Elderly below is also beautifully built, with two large courtyards in front and back, and the arranged bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, reading rooms, and clubs are all very orderly, and everywhere appears elegant and comfortable. A park has also been established on a green hill here. In the park is the Jinggang Mountain Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Tower, and behind the memorial tower is a Red Army Martyrs Cemetery. In recent years, these buildings have added new and vibrant colors to this beautiful mountain and river.

　　Accompanied by Comrade Zou Ruizhang of the Jinggang Mountain People's Commune, we went to visit Chairman Mao's former residence in D井 Village.

　　It is thirty華里 from Ciping to D井 Village. Originally, to get there, one had to walk through high mountains and deep valleys, on rugged paths. Now, roads are being rushed to repair, so we walked along the road.

　　Comrade Zou Ruizhang is from D井 Village. As we walked, he told us revolutionary stories. Climbing over the second mountain ridge, he stopped and pointed to two houses in the valley opposite us and said: "This is Xiaojing Village, the site of the Red Army Hospital and military uniform factory in those years. Premier Zhou lived there. The big mountain behind Xiaojing Village is Wangyangjie, the highest peak of Jinggang Mountain."… We continued talking and walking, and without realizing it, we arrived at D井 Village. The houses in D井 Village are all newly built, and the village is in the green mountains and forests, with three streams winding around on the front side. To enter the village, one must cross a wooden bridge. The village is guarded on all sides. The South哨口 has Shuangma Stone, the East哨口 has Dongshan, the West哨口 has 八面 Mountain, and the North哨口 has Wangyangjie. When we entered the village, we first visited the house where Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Marshal Peng Dehuai lived, called Tianxinli. Now there is only the foundation and no houses. In order to commemorate them, the people in the mountainous area erected a stone tablet on this site, with the words "Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Commander Peng lived here in 1927" engraved in bright red letters. The Zhuangzi where Chairman Mao lived, called Xinfangkeng, is said to have originally had more than seventy houses. After the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the enemy burned them down several times, and now only half of the walls remain, with two ancient cypress trees left behind the walls. In order to meet the needs of visitors, the Jinggang Mountain People's Commune has drawn a graphic of the original appearance of Chairman Mao's house and is preparing to establish a revolutionary history memorial hall here.

　　One morning, Comrade Zhang Zhixiang, director of the Party Committee Office of the Jinggang Mountain People's Commune, told us about the situation in Jinggang Mountain. He said: "The current Jinggang Mountain is a 'Mountain of Treasures'! The pine and fir trees produced on the mountain are endless. This is a good raw material for construction. Every year, Jinggang Mountain exports a large amount of timber to other places to support national economic construction. The tea oil and tung oil produced on the mountain also have considerable annual yields. The camphor, green bamboo, and medicinal materials produced on the mountain are everywhere, and many have not yet been well developed and utilized. Since the Great Leap Forward, minerals that have been buried underground for a long time have begun to see the light of day. According to surveys by geological exploration personnel, the iron ore reserves in Jinggang Mountain are extremely rich and of good quality, and the distribution area is also wide, which can provide a large amount of ore. Forty to fifty places where non-ferrous metals are deposited have also been discovered in the mountainous area. These treasures are gradually benefiting the people in the mountainous area."

　　革命摇篮井冈山
　　熊天荆
    革命摇篮井冈山，早在人们思想上生下深厚的感情。不久前，我们访问了井冈山。从泰和出发，一路上尽是一片一片的浓密森林。下午到了狮子口。这是当年红军保卫井冈山根据地的内围基地，群山嵯峨，地势险要。现在成千上万的人在这里修建厂房——造纸厂、发电站和职工住宅。
    从狮子口前行，出现在我们眼前的又是一幅壮伟的图景：山岗深谷，到处是跃进的口号、标语，有的用杉树皮钉在峭壁上，有的用灰砖砌字从山脚砌到山顶。每个山岗上，都耸立着高大的跃进门，两旁写着毛主席勉励革命老根据地的题词：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。
    下午四点钟，到达了井冈山乡人民公社所在地——茨坪。
    茨坪周围环绕山林，中间有块约五百亩面积的平坝。坝上有水田，也有村庄。春天是这里最好的季节，到处生长红花绿叶，风景秀丽。
    茨坪东麓接近永新县的拿山，西麓接近酃县的水口，与山上的大井、小井、中井、下井、上井、草坪、白银湖同为保卫根据地的重要基地。在军事上，进可以攻，退可以守，真有“一夫当关，万夫莫敌”的险要。当地人民曾把这里比做“摩天岭”说“飞鸟难过井冈山”。解放后，井冈山曾经设立特别区，1956年改设井冈山乡，由遂川县领导，现在乡社合并，井冈山人民公社仍设在茨坪。
    茨坪是个新建的山村，也是一个新型的山区城市。从汽车站往西走，大片新建的房屋沿着山边耸立着，街道上设有人民银行、新华书店、井冈山小学、邮电局、供销社、照相馆、医院门诊部、土产门市部、百货商店、井冈山饭店，日日夜夜挤满了熙熙攘攘的人群。从这前走不远，是疗养区。疗养区的房屋，都是两层的砖瓦楼房，房子高大，十分美观，当你站在山峰上，可以清楚地看见在绿色的树林里点缀着无数红色的屋顶和蓝色的窗户。这些花园似的别墅，都是在1958年下半年由政府拨款修建的，来到这里休养的大多是红军老革命同志。
    与疗养站遥遥相对的是一座容纳八百人的劳动大学正在修建，在树林下修建的井冈山大礼堂，规模很大，可容纳二千多人，这是会场又是戏院。这里的新文化馆，除陈列着江西本省赠送的文物，还有中央农垦部赠送的机械农具，文化部赠送的电影机，上海文化局、出版社赠送的图书、印刷机，四川赠送的发电机，湖南赠送的收音机，真可说是从祖国各地都支援井冈山。
    再向东北走，这里兴建了许多厂房，这里有造酒厂、木材加工厂、机械厂、砖瓦厂，还有一栋一栋的职工宿舍。在林荫深处露出一座很漂亮的楼房，这是井冈山交际处，下边的敬老院，建筑也很美观，前后两大栋四合院，里面安排的寝室、客厅、饭堂、阅览室、俱乐部都很有秩序，到处显得雅致舒适。在这里一个翠冈上，还建立了个公园。公园里有井冈山革命烈士纪念塔，在纪念塔后面有一座红军烈士墓。几年来，这些建筑物已给这片秀丽的山川增添了新的鲜艳的色彩。
    在井冈山人民公社邹瑞章同志的陪同下，我们去大井村毛主席故居游览。
    从茨坪到大井村有三十华里，原来到那里，要走高山深坳，崎岖小道，现在正抢修公路，我们就沿着公路线徒步前往。
    邹瑞章同志是大井村人，一路走，他一路谈着革命的故事。爬越到第二个山岭，他停住了脚步，指着对面山谷中的两间房子对我们说：“这就是小井村，是当年红军医院和军服工厂所在地，周总理曾在那里住过。小井村后面的大山，是井冈山的最高峰望洋界。……我们继续谈着走着，不觉得来到大井村。大井村的房屋，都是新盖的，村子在青山绿林中，前侧有三条小溪绕过，进村，必须过木桥。村子四面都有把守哨口。南哨口有双马石，东哨口有东山，西哨口有八面山，北哨口有望洋界。我们进村首先参观了朱总司令和彭德怀元帅住过的房子，叫田心里，现在只有屋基没有房屋，山区人民为着纪念他们，在这旧址立了一块石碑，碑上刻着：“1927年间朱总司令和彭军长住此”的大红字。毛主席住过的庄子，叫新房坑，据说原来有七十余间房屋，在红军北上抗日后，敌人连次烧毁，现在只剩半边墙垣，墙后面留下两棵古老柏树。为了满足来访者的要求，井冈山人民公社已按照毛主席住房原样绘成图形，准备在这里成立革命历史纪念馆。
    一天上午，井冈山人民公社党委办公室主任张志祥同志向我们谈起井冈山的情况，他说：现在的井冈山是“百宝山”呀！山上出产的松杉，一望无际，这是建设中的好原料，每年井冈山都有大批木材输出外地，支援国家经济建设。山上出产的茶油、桐油，每年产量也很可观。山上出产的樟脑、青竹和药材遍地都是，至今尚有许多没有很好地开发利用。在大跃进以来，长期埋藏在地下的矿藏开始得见天日。据地质勘探人员调查，井冈山蕴藏的铁矿极为丰富而且质量很好，分布的面积也广，可以提供大量矿石。在山区发现蕴藏的有色金属也有四、五十处。这些宝藏，正在陆续为山区人民造福。
