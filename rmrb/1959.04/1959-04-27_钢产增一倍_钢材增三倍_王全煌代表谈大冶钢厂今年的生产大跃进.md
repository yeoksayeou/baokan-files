Fellow Representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. I am an ordinary worker from the Daye Steel Plant in Hubei Province. I am not good at speaking, so I can only say what's on my mind and talk about the actual situation of our Daye Steel Plant.

I believe that the various policies adopted by the Central Committee in 1958 were entirely correct. This is not only proven by the Great Leap Forward examples across the country, but also fully and specifically proven by the comprehensive Great Leap Forward achieved by our Daye Steel Plant in the past year or so under the leadership of the Party, implementing the Central Committee's policies.

　　Last Year's Total Steel Production Exceeded the Total Steel Production of the Hanyeping Company

　　More Than Three-Fifths of the Total Steel Production of Fifty-Nine Years

In the first half of 1958, more than 20,000 employees of our Daye Steel Plant, under the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees and the plant's Party committee, underwent a series of great revolutions in politics and ideology, such as the great rectification movement, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the socialist great debate. We swept away the "three winds" and "five airs," cleared out Right-leaning conservatism, transformed leadership style, greatly improved socialist consciousness, and promoted the communist spirit. As a result, we revised the leap forward plan four times consecutively. In the second half of 1958, especially after the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee issued the great call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel in 1958, everyone saw the Great Leap Forward situation where one day equaled twenty years. We actively responded to this call and, under the specific leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees, resolutely implemented the policy of "taking steel as the key link, combining large, medium, and small scale, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and walking on two legs." We quickly launched a massive mass steelmaking movement throughout the plant. Technological innovations emerged continuously, and the level of production soared, fundamentally changing the face of our plant's production. We completed the annual production tasks of steel, steel materials, and pig iron ahead of schedule and above quota. In particular, steel production increased significantly, with the annual steel production reaching more than 314,000 tons, an increase of 1.77 times compared with 1957, more than doubling. This figure is equivalent to 60 percent of the steel production during our plant's first five-year plan, accounting for more than three-fifths of the total steel production of our plant's predecessor—the old China's Hanyeping Company—from its founding in 1890 to the eve of liberation in 1949, a total of 59 years.

The Great Leap Forward of this year was also reflected in the accelerated progress of our plant's capital construction. The total investment completed throughout the year increased by 70 percent compared with 1957, almost half of the total investment in the first phase of the expansion project, ensuring that several major equipment were put into production in this year.

　　This Year's First Quarter Steel Production Increased by More Than 24 Percent Compared to Last Year's Fourth Quarter, and Steel Materials Increased by More Than 58 Percent

Since the beginning of this year, on the basis of last year's victory, in order to complete the task of doubling steel production and tripling steel materials compared with last year, and to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, according to the instructions of the provincial and municipal Party committees to "launch a production increase and conservation campaign centered on technological revolution," through opposing conservatism, opposing slackness, breaking superstitions, and liberating thought, the workers were full of energy and high morale. A large number of technological revolutions and technological innovations emerged, and many key production and weak links were continuously broken through. In the first quarter, a total of 96,786 tons of steel, 49,488 tons of steel materials, and 15,191 tons of pig iron were produced. Steel production increased by 24.9 percent compared with the fourth quarter of last year, steel materials increased by 58.5 percent, and pig iron increased by 12.7 percent. The quality of various steels also increased by 2 to 20 percent respectively.

In the movement, through top-down anti-conservatism, boosting morale, raising measures, and tackling key issues, everyone worked hard and skillfully. According to incomplete statistics, in the first quarter, the plant's employees put forward more than 8,300 innovation proposals, of which more than 300 were major innovation measures, and 6,669 have been successfully developed and partially implemented. For example, workers at No. 2 open hearth furnace seized the key to shortening smelting time, adopted the new technology of "high-temperature thin patching, layered sintering" and successfully trial-produced "post-furnace deoxidation," which not only broke through the furnace protection barrier but also extended the eye-socketing from every shift and every furnace in the past to eleven days without eye-socketing. According to preliminary statistics, if it is fully promoted in four open hearth furnaces, it can increase steel production by more than 10,000 tons per year. Mold workers, in response to the difficulty of supplying intermediate pouring tubes, created the "top-pouring ingot operation method." After more than 30 experiments, it has been basically successful. After full promotion, it can save more than 4,000 tons of molten steel per year. Another example is the furnace-building workers in the iron-melting furnace of the newly-built converter workshop. In order to break through the key to the low life of the iron-melting furnace and the failure to supply molten iron to the converter, so that the converter can make more steel, a series of improvements were made to the furnace-building operation, making the furnace life increase from the original minimum of 128 furnaces for small furnaces and 38 furnaces for large furnaces to 348 furnaces for small furnaces and 210 furnaces for large furnaces. In March of this year, it reached 533 furnaces for small furnaces and 304 furnaces for large furnaces. The average number of furnaces also increased from the original 158 furnaces to 203 furnaces. The amount of iron melted reached 2,432 tons, ensuring the supply of molten iron for the converter. All the workers of the No. 1 electric furnace, named the Red Flag No. 1 electric furnace by the municipal Party committee, focused on the key to long smelting time and short furnace life. They successively improved "double-door charging" and promoted and learned advanced experience such as "high-temperature boiling," "automatic slag flow," and "sedimentation deoxidation," shortening the smelting time per furnace from more than three hours in the past to two and a half hours, and also creating a new record of smelting a furnace of high-quality steel in 1.55 minutes, thus completing the first quarter's national plan ahead of schedule by five days and twenty-two hours. The whole country is a chess game, the whole Party is of one mind, with everyone exerting the same effort,

　　Front and Rear Cooperate to Strive to Complete This Year's Steelmaking Task

Under the guidance of the principle of taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward, we have also conscientiously implemented the principle of "the whole country is a chess game, the whole Party is of one mind, and everyone exerts the same effort," and have achieved great cooperation between the front and rear, all contributing their efforts in the battle for steel. The employees of the transportation, processing, and machinery departments proposed "taking smelting as the key link, strengthening maintenance and repair, ensuring the normal operation of equipment, and timely meeting the supply of spare parts and raw materials, while vigorously engaging in the production of mechanical spare parts and arming ourselves." In February alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than 50 various special-purpose machine tools, 32 ten-kilowatt motors, 5 electric welding machines, and 5 sets of automatic thermal control instruments have been manufactured. For example, in order to complete the transportation volume that increased by 2.02 times compared with last year, the employees of the transportation department proposed the battle slogans of "vehicles arriving whenever needed" and "thousands, hundreds, and tens of thousands." In order to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, the loading and unloading workers have reformed more than 2,000 tools. They created semi-section tipper machines and tower loading machines at the loading and unloading docks and loading and unloading yards respectively, increasing transportation efficiency by more than five times. According to the key to the difficulty in grasping the temperature of the rolling steel soaking furnace by manual operation, the instrument workers innovatively trial-produced a set of thermal control instruments, which not only changed manual operation to automatic control, reduced physical labor, but also greatly improved the quality of steel ingot heating. The machine repair workers self-made 140-kilowatt and 30 special-purpose machine tools. The employees of the supply department also truly faced production and delivered materials to the door.

　　Leaders and Workers Combine, and Production Successes Are Reported Frequently

Since the beginning of this year, leading cadres from the plant to the workshop, from the workshop to the work section, and from various sections have all gone deep into key issues, engaged in three-way combinations, and planted experimental fields, leading production from production and leading the masses from the masses. Comrade Li Zhenjiang, Secretary of the Party Committee, and Comrade Li Zhonglian, Deputy Director of Production, through going deep into the First Steelmaking Department, organizing relevant engineering and technical personnel, and focusing on the high sulfur content caused by more local iron and less foreign iron in March, took No. 3 open hearth furnace as the key point and adopted the method of simultaneous experimentation, analysis, and research in the same operation with the workers, pioneering the new technology of "electric furnace slag and open hearth mixed steelmaking." In six days, after eleven experiments, the desulfurization efficiency reached 50 to 60 percent, turning local iron into high-quality steel. Not only was the smelting time per furnace shortened by one to two hours compared with the past, but also reliable guarantees were provided for maintaining the furnace life. Comrade Jiang Min, Director of the Plant, and Comrade Han Changxing, Deputy Director of the Plant, through going deep into the newly-built Second Steelmaking Department with incomplete equipment, camped and fought hard, urged and directed, and timely studied with the department's leadership, and organized the department's Party, government, labor union, and youth league leaders to go deep into the key processes of furnace lining, baking, and blowing, adopting a one-stop working method, guarding each level, and engaging in three-way combinations, and many key issues were solved. For example, Su Fangzhong, Deputy Director of the Furnace Lining Workshop, focused on the key to the simple furnace lining equipment and the inability of manual operation to keep up with foreign furnaces. From participating in the operation, he specifically helped the old worker Chen Yongming successfully trial-produce two local brick-laying machines, making the furnace lining quickly jump from the original daily output of 270 pieces to 400, 500, and finally to more than 1,000 pieces, breaking through the throat of the converter—the furnace lining pass. The furnace lining life has also increased from the original minimum of three to five times to ten, twenty, thirty times, and the highest reached forty-five times, making the daily output of the Second Steelmaking Department constantly break through from 900 tons to 1,000 to 1,200 tons. Leading comrades such as Yang Anrang, Deputy Secretary of the General Branch of the First Steelmaking Department, and Engineer Tao Shende, discovered that workers had the problems of "three lows" (low-temperature furnace patching, low-temperature charging, and low-temperature mineral addition) and "four waits" (waiting for melting, waiting for analysis, waiting for slag formation, and waiting for slag removal) in the smelting process during their day and night hard work with the workers. They immediately studied and proposed "shortening smelting time" as the combat direction, organized workers to deliberate and discuss, and promoted the change of "three lows" to "three highs" and the change of "four waits" to "four fasts," so that during the refining period, "high-temperature thin patching" and "active boiling" were achieved. Not only did the desulfurization rate reach 62 percent, but also the smelting time per furnace was shortened by more than one hour compared with the past.

　　Fight in April, Create Miracles, Seize the Red Flag, Welcome May

Although our Daye Steel Plant has made great achievements in various aspects last year and in the first quarter of this year, there are still many problems and shortcomings. That is to say, looking back, there is great progress, but looking forward, it is still far from enough. Especially compared with the advanced factories and mines across the country, we are even further behind. Judging from several major technical and economic indicators, we are still far from the requirements of the state. The product quality and the completion of production according to variety are not good, the labor productivity is low, and there is also a waste of manpower. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, there have been more rules and regulations broken and fewer established. Production and technical management are also somewhat chaotic and cannot keep up with the needs of production development.

These problems have been studied and discussed by all employees under the leadership of the plant's Party committee, and many measures have been taken to improve and enhance them. In particular, since the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the notice on convening a meeting of advanced collectives and advanced producers representatives in March, the labor enthusiasm of all employees has been further encouraged, and our confidence and determination to overcome shortcomings have been increased. Everyone has expressed that they will create more and better achievements to strive to see Chairman Mao in Beijing. At present, all employees of the plant, in order to ensure the completion of the production tasks in the second quarter and April, have also put forward the determination to "vigorously engage in revolution, make innovations, achieve high-yield and high-quality great competition, and vow to seize 140,000 tons of steel production and break through the 100,000-ton barrier for steel materials" and "fight in April, create miracles, seize the red flag, and welcome May." At the same time, various departments, workshops, and groups have also convened oath-taking rallies to express their determination to the Party in order to ensure the realization of the plant's tasks. For example, the employees of the First Steelmaking Department put forward the determination to "fight hard in April, achieve red every week, red every month, full red, and everyone strives to go to Beijing." The employees of the Second Steelmaking Department put forward the guarantee to "boost morale, make great innovations, break through key issues, create miracles, produce high-quality and multi-variety products, and vow to exceed 60,000 to welcome July 1." The fitter group, which was named the Youth Red Flag Team by the Huangshi Municipal Party Committee, in order to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council with practical actions, the young men put forward to the Party: "Fighting hard and skillfully together, quota breakthroughs by 35 percent, quality reaching 100 percent, determined to go to Beijing for the second time."

Finally, after listening to the reports of the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee, I felt infinitely happy about the great achievements of the country in recent years. After I return to the factory, I will definitely convey and implement the spirit of this conference to every employee, actively participate in the production increase and conservation movement with my own practical actions, humbly learn from advanced experience, and strive to complete this year's steel production task ahead of schedule and above quota, and contribute my part to accelerating the construction of socialism and communism.

专栏：

    钢产增一倍　钢材增三倍
    王全煌代表谈大冶钢厂今年的生产大跃进各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告及李富春、李先念副总理的报告。我是湖北省大冶钢厂的一个普通工人，讲不好话，只能有啥说啥，讲一点我们大冶钢厂的实际情况。
    我认为一九五八年中央所采取的各项方针政策是完全正确的。这不仅为全国各地大跃进的事例所证明，而且从我们大冶钢厂一年多来，在党的领导下，执行中央的方针政策所取得的全面大跃进来说，也得到充分的、具体的证明。
    去年全年的钢产量超过汉冶萍公司
    五十九年钢产量总和的五分之三还多
    一九五八年上半年我们大冶钢厂的两万多名职工在省、市委和厂党委的领导下，经过伟大的整风运动、反右斗争和社会主义大辩论等一系列的政治上、思想上的大革命，横扫了“三风”、“五气”，清除了右倾保守，转变了领导作风，大大提高了社会主义觉悟和发扬了共产主义精神，因而曾连续四次修订了跃进规划。一九五八年下半年特别自党中央政治局扩大会议发出一九五八年产钢一千零七十万吨的伟大号召以后，大家看到了一天等于二十年的大跃进形势，积极响应了这一号召，在省、市委的具体领导下，坚决贯彻了“以钢为纲，大中小并举，土洋结合，两条腿走路”的方针，迅速在全厂范围内掀起了一个声势浩大的全民炼钢运动，技术革新不断涌现，生产水平蒸蒸日上，使我厂的生产面貌起了一个根本性的变化，提前超额完成了全年的钢、钢材和生铁的生产任务。其中特别是钢的产量有了很大的增长，全年钢产量达到三十一万四千多吨，比一九五七年提高了一点七七倍，翻了一番还拐了一个大弯。这个数字等于我们厂第一个五年计划期间钢产量的百分之六十，占了我们厂前身——旧中国的汉冶萍公司一八九○年创办时起到一九四九年解放前夕止，共五十九年间钢产量总和的五分之三还多。
    这一年的大跃进，还表现在我们厂的基本建设上加速了进度。全年完成总投资额比一九五七年多百分之七十，几乎为第一期扩建工程全部投资的一半，保证了几项主要设备都在这一年全部投入了生产。
    今年一季度比去年四季度钢产增百分之二十四多，钢材增百分之五十八多
    今年以来，在去年胜利的基础上，我们为了完成比去年钢产量翻一番，钢材翻三番的任务，实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进，根据省、市委“以开展技术革命为中心的增产节约运动”的指示，通过反保守、反松劲、破迷信、解放思想，工人们干劲冲天，斗志旺盛，技术革命和技术革新大量出现，许多生产关键和薄弱环节不断突破，第一季度共产钢九万六千七百八十六吨，钢材四万九千四百八十八吨，生铁一万五千一百九十一吨。钢产量较去年第四季度增长百分之二十四点九，钢材增长百分之五十八点五，生铁增长百分之十二点七，各种钢的质量亦分别提高了百分之二到百分之二十以上。
    在运动中，经过自上而下的反保守、鼓干劲、提措施、攻关键，大家苦干巧干，据不完全统计，第一季度全厂职工共提出革新建议八千三百多项，其中重大革新措施达三百多项，已有六千六百六十九项制成功和部分实现。例如：二号平炉工人抓住缩短冶炼时间这一关，采取“高温薄补，分层烧结”和试制成功了“炉后脱氧”的新技术，不仅攻破了护炉关、仅套眼子由过去班班套眼子，炉炉套延长到十一天未套，据初步统计，若四个平炉全面推广后，一年可增产钢一万吨以上。整模工人针对中注管供应缺乏的困难，创造了“上注浇锭操作法”，经过三十多次的试验，已经基本获得成功，全面推广后，一年可节约钢水四千余吨。又如新建转炉车间的化铁炉砌炉工人，为了突破化铁炉寿命低，铁水供应不上转炉的关键，使转炉多炼钢，将砌炉操作进行了一系列的改进，使炉子寿命由原来最低小炉一百二十八炉，大炉三十八炉，提高到小炉三百四十八炉，大炉二百一十炉。今年三月份又达到了小炉五百三十三炉，大炉三百零四炉，平均炉数亦由原来的一百五十八炉提高到二百零三炉，化铁量达到二千四百三十二吨，保证了转炉铁水的供应。被市委命名为红旗一号电炉的全体工人，围绕冶炼时间长、炉子寿命短的关键，他们先后改进了“双门加料”和推广学习了“高温沸腾”、“自动流渣”、“沉淀脱氧”等先进经验，使每炉冶炼时间，由过去三小时以上缩短到两个半小时，并且还创造了以一点五十五分钟炼一炉优质钢的新纪录，因而提前五天零二十二小时超额完成了第一季度国家计划。全国一盘棋，全党一条心，上下一股劲，    前后方协作，努力完成今年炼钢任务
    在以钢为纲，全面跃进的方针指导下，我们又认真的贯彻了“全国一盘棋，全党一条心，上下一股劲”的原则，作到了前后方大协作，都在为钢而战中贡献出自己一分力量。运输、加工、机械部门的职工提出了“以冶炼为纲，在加强维护检修，保证设备正常运转，及时满足备品、备件和原材料供应的前提下，大搞机械备品制作、自己武装自己”。仅二月份一个月的不完全统计，已制作各种专用机床五十多台，十瓩马达三十二个，电焊机五部，热工控制自动仪表五套。例如：运输部门职工为完成比去年增长二点零二倍的运输量，提出了“车辆随要随到”和“千、百、万”的战斗口号。为了实现装卸机械化和半机械化，装卸工人又改革了工具二千余件，他们在装卸码头和装卸料场分别创造了片半式翻斗机和塔式装料机，使运输效率提高五倍以上。计器工人根据轧钢均热炉手工操作，温度难掌握的关键，革新试制了一套热工控制仪表，不仅变人工操作为自动控制，减轻了体力劳动，而且大大提高了钢锭加热的质量。机修工人自制完成了一百四十瓩和三十台专用机床。供应部门职工亦真正做到了面向生产，将材料送上门。
    领导和工人结合　生产捷报频传
    今年以来，从厂到车间，从车间到工段，以及各科室等领导干部，均深入了重点关键问题上去，大搞三结合，种试验田，从生产中领导生产，从群众中领导群众。党委书记李振江同志、生产副厂长李仲连同志，通过深入第一炼钢部，组织有关工程技术人员，针对三月份土铁多、洋铁少的硫高关，以三号平炉为重点，在同工人一起操作中采取边试验、边分析、边研究的方法，首创“电炉渣和平炉混合炼钢”的新技术，在六天的时间中，经过十一次的试验，使脱硫效率达到百分之五十到百分之六十，把土铁炼成了优质钢，不仅每炉冶炼时间比过去缩短一至二小时，对维护炉子寿命亦有了可靠的保证。厂长江敏同志、副厂长韩长兴同志通过深入去年新建的、设备又不成套的第二炼钢部，扎营苦战、督促指挥，及时与该部领导共同研究，及组织该部的党、政、工、团领导分别深入到炉衬、烘烤、吹炼等四个工序的关键中去，采取了一条龙的工作方法，分关把守，大搞三结合，许多关键迎刃而解。如炉衬车间副主任苏芳忠，针对炉衬设备简陋，手工操作跟不上洋炉子的关键，从参加操作中，具体帮助老工人陈永明试制成功两部土打砖机，使炉衬迅速由原来日产二百七十块跃到四百、五百，最后到达一千多块，突破了转炉咽喉——炉衬关，炉衬寿命也由原来最低三至五次提高到一十、二十、三十多次，最高达四十五次，使二炼钢部由日产九百吨不断突破到一千至一千二百吨。第一炼钢部总支副书记杨安让副主任、陶慎德工程师等领导同志在同工人一起日夜苦战中，发现工人在冶炼过程中存在“三低”（低温补炉，低温加料，低温加矿）和“四等”（等熔化，等分析，等成渣，等放渣）的问题后当即研究提出“缩短冶炼时间”为战斗方向，组织工人酝酿讨论，推行变“三低”为“三高”、变“四等”为“四快”，从而在精炼期间作到了“高温薄补”、“活跃沸腾”，不但降硫率达到百分之六十二，并且使每炉冶炼时间比过去缩短一小时以上。
    战四月　创奇绩　夺红旗　迎五月
    去年和今年第一季度以来，我们大冶钢厂在各方面虽然取得了很大成绩，但也存在着不少的问题和缺点，也就是说向后看有很大前进，向前看还差得很远，特别是与全国先进厂矿比较起来，那我们就差得更远了。从几种主要技术经济指标来检查，距离国家对我们的要求相当远，产品质量和按品种生产完成的不大好，劳动生产率低，人力也有浪费。从去年大跃进以来，对一些规章制度破的较多而立的少，生产、技术管理也有些混乱，跟不上生产发展的需要。
    以上这些问题，在厂党委的领导下，经过全厂职工的研究讨论，已经采取许多措施办法来改进提高，特别自三月党中央和国务院发出关于召开先进集体和先进生产者代表会议的通知以来，更加鼓舞了全厂职工的劳动热情，增加了我们克服缺点的信心和决心，大家纷纷表示要创造更多更好的成绩争取来北京见毛主席。目前全厂职工为确保二季度和四月份生产任务的完成，又提出了“大搞革命，闹革新高产优质大竞赛，誓夺钢产十四万，攻破钢材十万关”和“战四月，创奇迹，夺红旗，迎五一”的决心，同时各部、车间、小组为了确保厂任务的实现，也纷纷召开了誓师大会，向党表决心。如第一炼钢部职工提出“大战四月，实现周周红，月月红，满堂红，人人争取上北京”的决心；第二炼钢部职工提出了“鼓足干劲大革新，攻破关键创奇迹，产品优质多品种，誓超六万迎七一”的保证，荣获黄石市委命名为青年红旗班组的钳工一组，为了以实际行动响应党中央和国务院的号召，小伙子们向党提出了“猛战巧干齐上阵，定额突破三十五，质量达到百分百，决心二次上北京。”
    最后，我听了党中央领导同志的报告，对国家几年来的伟大成就，我感到无限高兴。我回到厂后，一定把这次大会的精神传达与贯彻到每一个职工中去，以自己的实际行动积极投入到增产节约运动中去，虚心学习先进经验，争取提前和超额完成今年的钢产任务，为加速建设社会主义和共产主义贡献出自己的一份力量。
