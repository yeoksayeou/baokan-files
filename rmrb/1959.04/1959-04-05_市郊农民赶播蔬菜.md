    Suburban Farmers Rush to Sow Vegetables
    Beijing
    (Our newspaper reports) The people's communes in the suburbs of the capital, mainly engaged in vegetable cultivation, have recently launched a widespread vegetable production increase campaign. The members of these communes are busy preparing the land, delivering manure, and sowing spring vegetables such as garlic, peas, potatoes, Chinese cabbage, radishes, and rapeseed.
    During the competition, the people's communes in Haidian District are focusing on the management of overwintering root vegetables and rushing to sow early spring windbreak vegetables, striving to supply the people of the capital with eight million catties of vegetables before the end of April. The people's communes in Fengtai District plan to produce 570 million catties of commercial vegetables this year, an increase of 35.7% compared to last year. Currently, this district has completed the sowing of early spring windbreak vegetables seven days ahead of schedule and is stepping up the spring sowing of open-field vegetables.
    This year, the area of vegetable fields in the suburbs of the capital will be greatly increased. The people's communes in Tongzhou District plan to expand vegetable fields from 40,000 mu to 80,000 mu, and have now formed more than 450 specialized teams dedicated to vegetable production. The people's communes in Shunyi District, which in the past could only produce enough vegetables for local consumption, plan to expand vegetable fields from more than 60,000 mu last year to 100,000 mu. In addition to doing everything possible to increase vegetable production, the communes are also trying to increase the variety of vegetables. The Sijiqing People's Commune in Haidian District has added 94 new varieties of vegetables this year.
    Tianjin
    (Our newspaper reports) The communes in the suburbs of Tianjin are vigorously planting various spring vegetables. Most of the 100,000 mu of overwintering spring vegetables in ten counties and districts, including Hebei, Hedong, and Wuqing, have emerged from the soil and grown leaves, creating a lush green scene, and will be available in large quantities in April.
    With the increasing demand for vegetables from urban and rural people, the people's communes are increasing vegetable fields according to Tianjin's plan to expand the vegetable planting area by more than two times. The Xinli Village People's Commune in Hedong District is planting more than 30,000 mu of vegetables this year compared to last year. The Xingdian People's Commune in Hebei District plans to plant 39,000 mu of vegetables this year, with a planned average yield of 15,000 catties per mu, both the area and the yield per unit are much higher than last year.
    In order to ensure a greater leap forward in vegetable production, the Party groups of the communes have assigned dedicated personnel to lead this production. The communes in Jinghai County have established vegetable production leading groups headed by the Party committee secretaries. Many communes have not only assigned dedicated personnel to lead but also established vegetable production specialized teams and implemented responsibility systems such as "four packages" (district committee packages team, administrator packages canteen, group packages plot, person packages ridge).
    Learning vegetable planting techniques has become a craze in many communes. Some management areas in the Xinli Village Commune where vegetable planting techniques were unfamiliar have technical research groups.
    Harbin
    (Our newspaper reports) One hundred thousand mu of spring vegetables have begun to be sown in the suburbs of Harbin and the rural areas of the four subordinate counties. This year, Harbin plans to plant 900,000 mu of spring, summer, and autumn vegetables, an increase of 45.16% compared to last year; the varieties will also increase from more than 100 to more than 300. After this plan is realized, the 3.2 million residents of Harbin, including the members of rural people's communes, can eat more than two catties of vegetables per person per day on average. The economic income of the members of rural people's communes will also increase significantly as a result.
    The Harbin area is still relatively cold, but early-planted spring vegetables have already begun to be marketed. This year, in addition to using greenhouses, windbreaks (walls made of sorghum stalks), and covering grass curtains in the morning and evening, and other wind and cold protection methods to protect the growth of spring vegetables, they also adopted methods such as soaking seeds to promote germination, artificial pollination, and using growth hormone stimulation to promote the early maturity of spring vegetables.
    Harbin has also adopted a two-pronged approach to developing vegetable production this year. The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has called on factories, enterprises, government agencies, schools, and troops with more than 200 people to use vacant land to grow vegetables, and those with conditions should also raise pigs and poultry. Many units have already taken action. The vegetable planting plans of more than 700 units have been implemented, and they are preparing to plant 70,000 mu of vegetables.
    While developing vegetable production, Harbin has also arranged for the production of other non-staple foods.

    市郊农民赶播蔬菜
    北京
    本报讯　首都郊区以种植蔬菜为主的各人民公社，最近广泛展开了蔬菜增产竞赛。这些公社的社员们，一面忙着整地、送粪，一面播种大蒜、豌豆、土豆、小白菜、小萝卜和油菜等春季蔬菜。
    在竞赛中，海淀区各人民公社大抓越冬根茬蔬菜管理和抢播早春风障菜，力争4月底以前供应首都人民八百万斤蔬菜。丰台区各人民公社今年要生产商品菜五亿七千万斤，比去年增加35.7％。目前，这个区已经提前七天种完了早春风障蔬菜，正在加紧春播露地菜。
    今年首都郊区的菜地面积将大大增加。通州区各人民公社计划把菜田从四万亩扩大到八万亩，现在已经组成了四百五十多个专业队，专搞蔬菜生产。过去蔬菜生产仅能供本地自食的顺义区各人民公社，计划把菜田从去年的六万多亩扩大到十万亩。各公社除了千方百计地增加蔬菜产量外，还尽量增加蔬菜的品种。海淀区四季青人民公社今年新增加的蔬菜品种就有九十四种。
    天津
    本报讯　天津市郊各公社正在大力种植各种春菜。河北、河东、武清等十个县、区的十几万亩过冬春菜，多数已出土放叶，一片碧绿，在4月份可大量上市。
    随着城乡人民对蔬菜需要量的增长，各人民公社都根据天津市扩大蔬菜种植面积两倍多的规划增加菜田。河东区新立村人民公社今年种植的蔬菜比去年扩大三万亩以上。河北区兴淀人民公社今年计划种蔬菜三万九千亩，计划平均亩产一万五千斤，面积和单位产量都比去年提高很多。
    为了保证蔬菜生产的更大跃进，各公社党组都确定了专人领导这项生产。静海县各公社以党委书记为首建立了蔬菜生产领导小组。许多公社在有专人领导的同时还建立了蔬菜生产专业队和推行了“四包”（区委包队、管理员包食堂、组包地块、人包畦）等责任制。
    学习蔬菜种植技术在许多公社已成热潮。新立村公社一些种菜技术生疏的管理区都有技术研究组。
    哈尔滨
    本报讯　十万亩春菜开始在哈尔滨市郊和所属四县农村播种。今年哈尔滨市计划种植春、夏、秋菜九十万亩，种植面积要比去年扩大45.16％；品种也要由一百多种增加到三百多种。实现这个计划后，哈尔滨市包括农村人民公社社员三百二十万居民，平均每人每天可以吃到两斤以上的蔬菜。农村人民公社社员的经济收入，也因此增加许多。
    哈尔滨一带目前还比较寒冷，但早种的春菜已经开始上市。这里今年种菜，除了利用温室，利用风障子（秫秸夹的墙）和早晚复盖草帘子等十多种防风御寒的办法保护春菜生长外，还采用了浸种催芽、人工授粉以及用生长素刺激等办法，促进春菜早熟。
    哈尔滨市今年发展蔬菜生产也采取了两条腿走路的办法。中共哈尔滨市委已号召二百人以上的工厂、企业、机关、学校、驻军都要利用空闲的土地种植蔬菜，有条件的还要养猪和养家禽。现在许多单位已经行动起来。七百多个单位的种菜计划已经落实，准备种菜七万亩。
    哈尔滨市在发展蔬菜生产的同时，还安排了其它副食品生产。
