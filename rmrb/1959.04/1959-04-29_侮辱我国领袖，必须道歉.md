    Insulting Our Nation's Leader Must Be Apologized For
    To the Editors:
    Recently, imperialists and Indian expansionists, taking advantage of the rebellion of reactionary elements in the upper strata of Tibet, China, have rudely interfered in our internal affairs, which has aroused immense anger among the people of the whole country. Most hateful of all, Indian expansionists have gone even further, openly "demonstrating" in front of the Chinese Consulate in Bombay, India, and insulting the portrait of our beloved Chairman Mao. This is a great insult to the Chinese people.
    We warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists to quickly withdraw your claws, or you will be crushed by the iron fists of China's 650 million people.
    If the Indian authorities are wise, they should quickly remedy this unfriendly situation in the following ways:
    I. An apology must be made for the act of insulting Chairman Mao's portrait;
    II. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence must be strictly observed, and there must be no interference in China's internal affairs;
    III. The Dalai Lama, who was abducted by the rebellious elements, must be safely returned;
    IV. The small group of upper-class traitors in Tibet must be handed over to our government.

    侮辱我国领袖，必须道歉编辑同志
    最近，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子利用我国西藏上层反动分子叛乱事件，粗暴地干涉我国内政，已经引起了全国人民的无比愤怒。最可恨的是，印度扩张主义分子变本加厉，公然在印度孟买我国领事馆前“示威”，并对我国人民敬爱的毛主席相片加以侮辱，这是对我国人民的极大侮辱。
    我们警告帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，赶快收起你们的魔爪吧，否则，你们会在中国六亿五千万人民的铁拳下碰得粉碎。
    印度当局如果是明智的话，赶快从以下几个方面挽回这种不友好的局面：
    一、关于侮辱毛主席相片的行为，必须道歉；
    二、严格遵守五项原则，不得干涉中国内政；
    三、安全送回被叛乱分子劫持的达赖喇嘛；
    四、将西藏一小撮上层叛国分子送交我国政府。
