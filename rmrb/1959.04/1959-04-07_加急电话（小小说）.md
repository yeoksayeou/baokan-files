Urgent Phone Call (Short Story)
		Wan Long, Huinan County Broadcasting Station, Jilin

	It was late at night when Granny Wang of the Dongfeng People's Commune returned home from the nursery and lay down in bed. Just as she was dozing off, she heard someone shouting outside the window:
		"Granny Wang, you have an urgent phone call!"
	Hearing the shout, Granny Wang immediately sat up and loudly retorted:
		"Who is it? What did you say? A phone call?"
	"It's Ersheng! You have an urgent phone call, come to the office to answer it!"
	Although Granny Wang agreed, she was doubtful, muttering: It's true that the older I get, the more fashionable I become. I haven't received a phone call in most of my life, and now it's something "urgent"... She put on her clothes and went to the commune office.
	The light in the office was still on, and the commune cadres were holding a meeting in the outer room, discussing the replanting after the rain.
	When Director Sun saw Granny Wang coming, he stood up and said, "Granny Wang, you're really busy! Someone is calling you urgently even in the middle of the night!"
	Granny Wang didn't bother to answer the director and hurried into the inner room to answer the phone.
	The commune had installed a telephone some time ago, but Granny Wang had never used it. As she stared blankly at the receiver, she heard a rustling sound from the receiver:
		"Hello! Is this Granny Wang?"
		"Ah! It's me! Who is this? ... Where are you calling from?"
	"This is the Red Flag Commune! Can I ask you to do something?"
		"Sure! What is it? ... What... the seed drill wheels are not enough! Take the unused wheels from the commune's carpentry group... what? Send three of them over? What? It's best to bring them tomorrow, the weather is dry, it's good to plant them while yesterday's rain was heavy... Okay!"
	Granny Wang held the receiver and was stunned for a long time. Hearing that the Red Flag Commune needed seed drill wheels, she immediately blamed Grandpa Wang, feeling that her old partner was too careless, probably only busy going to the city to see his daughter, and forgot the wheels when loading the truck. She was really angry, and originally wanted to tell the director about this, but then she thought that the director's temper was too fiery and he would definitely be anxious, so she didn't tell the director and walked back, constantly muttering:
		"Is this how we support the great harvest! They talk a good game, what kind of great collaboration is this? It's all just lip service."
	The old couple were both over sixty years old this year. Grandpa Wang refused to admit that he was old when working, so the commune members called him Old Strong. Granny Wang was always involved in major and minor affairs in the commune, and she had to ask about things she shouldn't be concerned with, so the commune members called her "Old Active." Everyone in the commune knew about them.
	After the establishment of the People's Commune last year, Grandpa Wang, because of his carpentry skills, took up the adze, chisel, and saw and joined the carpentry group; Granny Wang went to the nursery to be a nursery worker. The old couple competed with each other, and neither was willing to fall behind. In order to improve the speed and quality of double-row corn planting, Grandpa Wang and several carpenters in the carpentry group researched a "double-row corn seed drill," which could plant more than two hectares of land every day, with high efficiency and good quality. When the county learned about it, it immediately held an on-site meeting in their commune. The neighboring Red Flag Commune, because of the large-scale harvest of double-stalk corn last year, planned to plant more double-stalk corn this year, and discussed with the Dongfeng Commune to entrust their carpentry group to make one for them. When Grandpa Wang thought of great collaboration, he readily agreed. He worked for three consecutive nights to make this seed drill. The commune originally planned to find someone to send it to the Red Flag Commune, but coincidentally, it was Grandpa Wang's day off today. He planned to go to the city to see his daughter. Director Sun thought that Grandpa Wang was going to the street and would pass by the Red Flag Commune, so he sent a large cart and asked Grandpa Wang to drive the cart to send it to the Red Flag Commune. The Red Flag Commune was waiting for this seed drill to plant double-row corn, and now a phone call came saying that the wheels had not been brought, how could Granny Wang not be anxious? Now who will send the wheels? The people in the commune are busy. Why not just go there overnight?
	As soon as the east turned fish-belly white, Granny Wang came to the Red Flag Commune. She asked at the commune director's house, but the director was not at home, saying that he had been at the Nan Gou plot tidying up the seed drill all night and hadn't come home.
	Granny Wang came out of the commune director's house and went straight to Nan Di. Just around the willow tree, a group of people appeared in front of her, and several large safety lamps were still shining brightly in the field.
	Granny Wang then walked up and said loudly:
		"Which of you is the director?"
	The Red Flag Commune's Director Zhang was busy with mud all over his hands. When he heard someone looking for him, he walked over and said:
		"That's me! Granny, what's the matter?"
		"I'm from the Dongfeng Commune. I received your phone call last night. I was afraid of affecting your planting today, so I brought the seed drill wheels overnight."
	When people heard that the Dongfeng Commune had sent the wheels, they were extremely happy and suddenly surrounded Granny Wang. Suddenly, a person ran out, smiling loudly at Granny Wang and saying:
		"Old woman! You're really Old Active. You rushed to send the wheels overnight!"
	Granny Wang looked up and saw that it was the old man, and she blamed him: "Still talking, aren't you? It's not because you are too careless. As soon as you heard about seeing your daughter, you didn't care about anything. When you left home yesterday afternoon, why didn't you check carefully? Such a big machine, can't you see if it has wheels! Humph! You still have the nerve to say me, if I wasn't afraid of affecting the Red Flag Commune's planting, I wouldn't care about this!"
	When Grandpa Wang heard this, he said with a smile:
		"Old woman! You guessed wrong! Yesterday when I arrived here, the sun was already setting on the mountain. When the commune members saw that I had sent the seed drill, they were extremely happy and insisted that I try it out. When everyone saw that this thing planted so quickly and well, they said that one was too few. I suggested to the director that we should rush to make another one for them overnight. A lot of wood was found, but there was no material for making the wheels. At that time, I thought that our commune still had some uninstalled wheels, and it would be appropriate to bring them for them to use. To save time, I made an urgent phone call back, originally intending to call the director, but I thought that the director had been busy planting day and night these past two days, and it was the time when he was sleeping soundly in the middle of the night, so I didn't disturb him and called you instead."
	When Granny Wang heard these words, the anger in her heart disappeared all at once, and she secretly praised, "He's really Old Strong."
	The morning sun was particularly red, and the remaining snow in early spring had melted, and the muddy land released moisture and fragrance. The Red Flag Commune's Director Zhang led several commune members operating two double-row corn seed drills, galloping in the fields. The commune members were really happy, applauding and looking at the old couple, Old Strong and Old Active, not knowing what to say.

    加急电话（小小说）
    吉林辉南县广播站　万龙
    夜深了，东风人民公社的王大娘才从托儿所回到家里，躺到床上。正在似睡不睡的时候，忽听窗外有人喊：
      “王大娘，你的加急电话！”
    王大娘听到喊声，立刻坐起来，大声地反问了一句：
      “是谁呀？你说什么？电话？”
    “我是二生！你来加急电话啦，快到办公室接去吧！”
    王大娘嘴里虽然答应着，心里可犯了疑，叨咕着：真是越老越时兴了，多半辈子也没人给我打个电话，现在还是什么“紧急”的……她穿上衣服，就奔社办公室走去了。
    办公室的电灯还点着，社干部正在外屋开会，研究雨后抢种的事。
    孙社长一看王大娘来了，忙站起来说：“王大娘管事真不少哇！三更半夜还有人来加急电话呢！”
    王大娘顾不上答应社长，就急忙跑进里屋听电话去了。
    社里安电话并不是一天了，可王大娘还没打过。她看着听筒发楞的时候，听筒里传来沙沙的声音：
      “喂！你是王大娘吗？”
      “啊！是我呀！你是哪呀？……你在哪说话呀？”
    “我是红旗社呀！有件事托你办下可以吗？”
    “行啊！啥事你说吧！……什么……点播机轱辘不够啦！把社里木工组没用的轱辘……怎么的？给你们送三个去？什么？明天最好能捎到，天头旱，趁昨天下了场透雨好种上……好吧！”
    王大娘拿着听筒又楞了半天。听说了红旗社要点播机轱辘，立刻埋怨起王大爷来，觉得老伴做事太粗心，准是只忙着进城去看闺女，装车的时候就把轱辘给忘了，心里真生气，本想把这件事告诉给社长，又一想社长那个火性子脾气非着急不可，便没对社长说就往回走了，一边走，一边不断地嘟囔着：
      “就这么支援大丰收哇！嘴里说的可倒好，搞什么大协作呀？纯粹都是嘴片子。”
    老两口子，今年都六十多岁了。王大爷干活不服老，因此社员们都叫他老刚强。王大娘社里有个大事小情多咱也少不下她，不该管的事她也要问上三分，因此社员们都叫他“老积极”。提起他俩，社里人没有不知道的。
    去年成立人民公社后，王大爷因为是木匠手艺，又拿起锛凿斧锯参加了木工组；王大娘到托儿所当了保育员。老两口比着干，谁也不肯落后。为了提高双行苞米播种速度和质量，王大爷和木工组的几名木工研究了一台“双行苞米点播机”，每天能播两垧多地，效率很高，质量也好。县里知道信，马上在他们社里召开了现场会议，邻乡
  的红旗社因为去年种双株苞米获得大面积丰收，今年计划种双株苞米的面积更多，便和东风社商量打算托他们木工组给带做一台，王大
  爷一想起大协作就一口答应下来了。他一连打了三个通宵才把这台点播机做好，社里本来打算找人给红旗社送去，可巧，今天该王大爷休假，他打算进城去看闺女，孙社长一想，王大爷上街正好从红旗社路过，就派了一台大车，叫王大爷赶车给红旗社送去。人家红旗社就等着这台点播机种双行苞米呢，现在来电话说轱辘没捎去，王大娘哪能不着急呢。现在谁送轱辘去呢？社里的人正忙着呢。干脆自己连夜去一趟吧。
    东方刚发出鱼肚白色，王大娘就来到红旗社了。到社长家里一问，社长没在家，说是在南沟那块地里收拾点播机已经一宿没回家了。
    王大娘从社长家里走出来，就直奔南地走去了。刚拐过柳树趟子，一群人就出现在眼前，地里还明晃晃地点着几盏大保险灯。
    王大娘便走到跟前大声地说：
      “你们哪位是社长？”
    红旗社的张社长正忙的满手泥，一听有人找他便走过来说：
      “我就是！大娘，您有事吗？”
      “我是东风社的，昨下晚接你们打去的电话，怕影响你们今天种地，连夜把点播机轱辘给你们送来了。”
    人们听说东风社给送轱辘来了，高兴地了不得，忽下子就把王大娘围在中间了。突然一个人跑了出来，冲着王大娘大声笑着说：
      “老婆子！真是老积极。连夜就赶着把轱辘送来了啊！”
    王大娘抬头一看，原来是老头子，便埋怨起他来：“还说呢，还不是你办事太粗心，一听说去看闺女啥都不顾了，昨天下晌从家里走的时候咋不好好检查检查呢？那么大个机器，有没有轱辘还看不见！哼！还有脸说我呢，若不是怕影响人家红旗社种地，我才不管这份事呢！”
    王大爷一听，便笑呵呵地说：
    “老婆子！这宝你可押错了！昨天到这里的时候，太阳都卡山了，社员们一看我把点播机送来了，都高兴地了不得，非叫我给试试。大伙一看这玩艺种的又快又好，就说一台太少了。我就向社长提出连夜再给他们突击一台，木料找来不少，就是没有做轱辘的材料，当时我寻思咱们社还有些没安装的轱辘，拿来给他们用正合适，为了赶时间，我就往回打个加急电话，本想打给社长，一想社长这两天白天黑夜地忙着种地，三更半夜正是睡香甜觉的时候，就没惊动他，才把电话打给你了。”
    王大娘听了这番话，满肚子火气一下子全消了，心里暗暗地称赞道：“真是老刚强。”
    早晨的太阳特别红，初春的残雪已经消融了，泥土地放散着潮气和芳香。红旗社的张社长领着几名社员操纵着两台双行苞米点播机在大地里奔驰着。社员们心里真高兴，一面鼓掌，一面望着老刚强和老积极老两口，真不晓得该说什么好了。
