　　Spring on the Cultural Front
　　By Our Correspondent Lin Hai
    Spring has arrived in Czechoslovakia, and the working people are welcoming this beautiful season with diligent labor. The cultural circles are also showing a thriving atmosphere. Under the call of the Czechoslovak Communist Party to accelerate the socialist cultural revolution, the struggle against revisionist tendencies in the Czechoslovak literature, music, and film circles is being further developed. Writers and artists are holding high the clear banner of serving the socialist construction with literary and artistic creations, and moving towards closer integration with the working people and with real life.

    In order to welcome the Czechoslovak Socialist Cultural Congress to be held in June this year, national conferences of Czechoslovak literary, musical, and film workers were held in February and early March, respectively. These conferences all implemented the policy of resolutely opposing all bourgeois literary and artistic lines and creative thoughts, opposing revisionist tendencies, and emphasized the importance of the Party spirit, ideological character, and service to the people of literature and art.
　　Prospering the Socialist Literary Undertaking
    Czechoslovakia's literary undertaking has a fine revolutionary tradition. Many writers lived and fought with the people in the revolutionary struggle, and they created many works reflecting the Czechoslovak people's struggle for independence, freedom, and socialist victory. Like President Zapotocky, who passed away the year before last, he was not only a beloved leader of the Czechoslovak working people, but also an outstanding proletarian writer. His trilogy, such as "New Fighters Arise," which focused on the workers' movement, is a work loved by the Czechoslovak working people. Particularly worth mentioning is the work of Julius Fucik, revered by all progressive human beings in the world. His "Report from the Gallows" is recognized as a model of communist literature. After liberation, Czechoslovak writers created many excellent works reflecting socialist construction. 1958 was a year of vigorous literary creation, with many good novels, essays, and poems appearing, such as Skala's "Early Train of Hope" and Fleischmann's "City, You and I," which are considered to be works full of the feelings of the times and rich in artistic appeal. Some short stories describing factories and rural areas also truthfully expressed the working people's vigorous enthusiasm for building a socialist motherland and their increasingly better life.

    The development of Czechoslovakia's literary undertaking has been achieved through constant struggles in literary and artistic lines and creative thoughts. Here, it is necessary to look back at the Second Congress of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union in 1956. That conference struggled against all kinds of bourgeois ideas and revisionist tendencies that remained in the Czechoslovak literary and artistic circles at that time. President Zapotocky, who attended the meeting as a writer, first launched a sharp criticism of these erroneous ideas. Since then, the Czechoslovak Communist Party has strengthened its leadership over the literary and artistic circles and launched a series of discussions in the field of cultural thought. Especially since the Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party last year put forward the task of completing the socialist cultural revolution, the struggle against bourgeois literary and artistic thought, dominated by revisionist tendencies, has been carried out in the cultural field. The National Ideological Work Conference in October 1958 further criticized the harm and influence of revisionism, and specifically pointed out the fact that it existed more seriously in the literary circles. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Writers' Union in December discussed the issue of struggling against revisionist tendencies and influences in the cultural field. At present, the discussion on anti-revisionist tendencies is deepening, and the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Czechoslovak Writers' Union have strengthened the ideological leadership of the writers, and often hold discussions and seminars on creative thoughts. The representative meeting of the Writers' Union held on March 1 seriously discussed the tasks of literature in completing the socialist cultural revolution, and especially focused on the issue of literary and artistic lines and creative thoughts. The writers enthusiastically discussed the erroneous remarks at the Second Congress of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union and its impact, and deeply criticized the influence of Yugoslav revisionist literary theories and aesthetic views on the Czechoslovak literary circles. Stoll, a member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and a literary theorist, said at the meeting that exposing the hypocrisy of revisionist literary theories and aesthetic views is an important task of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union in the future and one of the conditions for the healthy development of Czechoslovak literature. Targeting those arguments that simply emphasize life experience and so-called purely objective reflection of reality, he said that the writer's understanding of life first lies in having a correct worldview, so that he can reflect the essence and phenomena of things in his works, distinguish between the new and the corrupt, and truly understand the truth of life. He emphasized that any attempt by revisionists to destroy the Party spirit principle of socialist art must be completely crushed. The writers who attended the meeting also believed that no work can be separated from society, the times, and life, and that every work reflects the writer's views on politics, life, and literature and art. The prosperity of the literary undertaking can only be achieved by constantly strengthening the Party spirit and ideological character of the works.

    The convening of the Writers' Union meeting greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the writers. They summed up the achievements and shortcomings of the past period and began a new battle along the correct direction pointed out by the Party. At present, many writers have gone to the countryside and factories to deeply understand the earth-shaking changes in every part of their great motherland and the great achievements of the people in building socialism. A letter to the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party passed by this Writers' Union meeting said: "We have united all honest literary workers and are determined to overcome all existing undesirable tendencies. In order to more resolutely help the Party and the people complete the socialist construction with the fine tradition of our socialist literature, we must better master Marxist-Leninist thought and more closely link with the working people." This is the determination and wish expressed by the Czechoslovak literary circles, and it is also a guarantee that Czechoslovakia's socialist literary undertaking will be more abundant and prosperous.
    Singing the Praises of Today's Life and Struggle
    "Living in today's era, our society and our life are full of the joy and happiness of the people. We must sing the praises of today's life and struggle, and use music to encourage people's enthusiasm for building the motherland and moving forward forever." This is what Nejedlý, President of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and a famous literary and artistic theorist, said at the recent Second Congress of the Czechoslovak Composers' Association. Music workers accepted his expectations with warm applause. At the meeting, they all expressed that they would continue to carry forward the fine tradition of Czechoslovak music closely linked to the people and set off a new upsurge in musical creation.

    The Czechoslovak people are a nation that loves music very much. They are not only good at singing and dancing, but also generally have a high level of appreciation for music. Whether in cities, in the countryside, at grand gatherings, or in gatherings of relatives and friends, people often use songs to express their greatest joy and deepest emotions. After liberation, with the victory of the socialist revolution, life put forward new topics for the music circles. In addition to carrying forward the fine tradition of Czechoslovak music, it also made music follow the policy of "creating music with socialist ideology and national style" put forward by the Czechoslovak Communist Party. In the past ten years, under the slogans of "composers are with the people" and "our music fights for the defense of peace," Czechoslovak musicians have written many new songs full of the feelings of the times. For example, Dobiáš's "Building the Motherland, Strengthening Peace" and Jan Seidl's "People! You must be vigilant" are deeply loved by the people and have won peace prizes and national prizes respectively.

    The progress of Czechoslovakia's music circles has not been smooth sailing. Under the influence of modern revisionist trends of thought in 1956, some Czechoslovak musicians showed wrong tendencies to despise folk music and mass songs, and some unhealthy songs appeared. At this time, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Composers' Association promptly put forward the slogan of "uniting all music workers and preventing revisionist attacks." At the recently held Congress of the Composers' Association, the pure music and pure art viewpoints advocated by revisionists were criticized more deeply and specifically. Nejedlý said well that this revisionist viewpoint is an attempt to make artists become deserters in life and struggle. He pointed out that musicians should go to factories and to the countryside, where there are inexhaustible themes worth singing the praises of. At this conference, music workers realized how these errors and shortcomings in creative thought had damaged the socialist cultural undertaking. They issued a resounding call to the entire music circles: resolutely counter all revisionist influences, improve the Marxist-Leninist creative level, and consolidate the connection between musicians and the people in every possible way. Write more works that truly conform to the thoughts and feelings of the working people of our great era. At present, the Czechoslovak music circles are restoring some traditional forms of maintaining contact between musicians and the people in the past, such as organizing cultural work teams and carrying out cultural voluntary labor, so as to truly go deep into the lives of the people and let music play the role of inspiring and educating the people. Musicians are using the famous saying of Czechoslovak artist Aleš, "I do not serve art, I want to use art to serve the people," as mutual encouragement.
    Planting Red Flags on the Silver Screen
    1958 marked the sixtieth anniversary of Czechoslovakia's film industry. Looking back at the long road that Czechoslovakia's film industry has traveled, people clearly see that only after liberation has Czechoslovakia's film industry truly achieved great development and new content. The Czechoslovak Communist Party attaches great importance to the educational role of films for the people. At present, there are 3,500 cinemas in Czechoslovakia, almost all over the cities and countryside. Since 1948, workers' film festivals have been held in industrial cities every year, and since 1951, film festivals of "Spring in the Countryside" have been organized in rural areas to screen the best films for workers and farmers, especially to take this opportunity to organize workers and farmers to discuss and listen to their opinions. This keeps the film industry in close contact with the working people.

    Czechoslovak films have a great impact on people's lives and have won widespread praise from the people. But audiences have also criticized some films. Just as an old worker said at the symposium of the First National Film Festival held in February this year, "I like this kind of film. After watching it, I feel that I must work and live better." This is exactly what countless working people require of films.

    In order to enable the film industry to keep up with the requirements of the people and society, this film festival was held under the slogan of "striving to make film creation more closely integrated with the lives of the people." After a series of heated discussions, achievements were summarized, and some erroneous tendencies in film creative thought were sharply criticized, pointing out the direction of future film creation. The conference pointed out that due to some shortcomings in film creative thought, some films that run counter to the thoughts and feelings of the times and the people have been produced, and to a certain extent, they openly show revisionist tendencies. At the meeting, in the discussions between the audience and film workers, it was affirmed that films should reflect modern life, and the most important thing is to reflect the mainstream of modern life, that is, the working people and the socialist construction. Film workers expressed that they must create typical socialist new people based on the principle of Party spirit, so that the audience can see more socialist heroes and the magnificent scene of the motherland's socialist construction on the screen. The Czechoslovak Radio commented on the conference, saying that this film festival is a milestone in the creative career of Czechoslovak films.

### 文化战线上的春天

　　文化战线上的春天
　　本报记者　林海
    春天来到了捷克斯洛伐克，工农群众以辛勤的劳动来迎接这个美好的时节，文化界也正出现着一片欣欣向荣的气象。在捷克斯洛伐克共产党提出加速社会主义文化革命的号召下，捷克斯洛伐克的文学、音乐、电影界的反修正主义倾向的斗争正进一步开展。作家们和艺术家们高举起用文学艺术创作为社会主义建设事业服务的鲜明旗帜，朝着和劳动人民、和现实生活更加密切结合的途径迈进。
    为了迎接将在今年6月召开的捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文化代表大会，2月和3月初，捷克斯洛伐克文学、音乐、电影工作者分别举行了全国性会议，这些会议都贯彻了坚决反对一切资产阶级文艺路线和创作思想，反对修正主义倾向的方针，并强调指出了文艺的党性、思想性和文艺为人民服务的重要性。
　　繁荣社会主义的文学事业
    捷克斯洛伐克的文学事业有着优良的革命传统，许多作家曾在革命斗争中同人民一起生活和战斗，他们创造出不少反映捷克斯洛伐克人民争取独立、自由和社会主义胜利的作品。像前年逝世的萨波托斯基总统，不仅是捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民敬爱的领袖，而且是一位杰出的无产阶级作家，他的以工人运动为题材的“新战士站起来”等三部曲是捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民热爱的作品。特别值得提出的是全世界进步人类都敬仰的尤利乌斯·伏契克的作品，他的“绞索套在脖子上的报告”，被人们公认为共产主义文学的典范。解放后，捷克斯洛伐克的作家们，创作了许多反映社会主义建设的优秀的作品。1958年更是文学创作十分兴旺的一年，出现了不少好的小说、散文和诗歌，如斯卡拉的“希望的早车”，弗列伊斯赫曼的“城市，你和我”等诗集都被认为是充满时代感情和富有艺术感染力的作品。一些描写工厂、农村的短篇小说也真实地表达了劳动人民建设社会主义祖国的蓬勃热情和他们日益美好的生活。
    捷克斯洛伐克文学事业的发展是在文艺路线和创作思想上进行不断的斗争中获得的。在这里，不能不回溯到1956年的捷克斯洛伐克作家联盟第二次代表大会。那次会议对当时在捷克斯洛伐克文艺界残存的形形色色的资产阶级思想和修正主义倾向进行了斗争。以作家身份出席会议的萨波托斯基总统首先对这些错误思想展开了尖锐的批评。从那以后，捷共更加强了对文艺界的领导，并在文化思想领域内开展了一系列的讨论。特别从去年捷共第十一次代表大会提出完成社会主义文化革命的任务后，在文化领域开展了反对以修正主义倾向为主导的资产阶级文艺思想的斗争。1958年10月全国思想工作会议进一步批判了修正主义的危害和影响，特别是指出了它在文学界存在得比较严重这一事实。12月作家联盟中央全会上又讨论了对文化领域修正主义倾向和影响进行斗争的问题。目前关于反修正主义倾向的讨论日渐深入，捷共和捷克斯洛伐克作家联盟都加强了对作家们的思想领导，经常举行有关创作思想的讨论和座谈。今年3月1日举行的作家联盟代表会议，认真严肃地讨论了文学在完成社会主义文化革命中的任务，特别着重讨论了文艺路线和创作思想的问题。作家们热烈讨论了捷克斯洛伐克作家联盟第二次代表大会上的错误言论和它产生的影响，并且深入地批判了南斯拉夫修正主义的文学理论和美学观点对捷克斯洛伐克文学界的影响。捷共中央委员、文艺理论家斯托尔在会上说，揭露修正主义文艺理论和美学观点的虚伪性是捷克斯洛伐克作家联盟今后的重要任务，也是捷克斯洛伐克文学得以健康发展的条件之一。他针对那些单纯强调生活经验，所谓纯客观地反映现实的论点说，作家对生活的认识首先在于要有正确的世界观，这样才能在作品中反映出事物的本质和现象，辨别新生的和腐朽的东西，才能真正洞悉生活的真理。他强调指出了要彻底粉碎修正主义者想摧毁社会主义艺术党性原则的任何企图。出席这次会议的作家们也都认为任何作品都不能脱离开社会、时代和生活，每一部作品都反映出作家对政治、对生活、对文艺的观点。而文学事业的繁荣是只有通过不断加强作品的党性和思想性才能达到的。
    作家联盟会议的召开大大鼓舞了作家们的热情，他们总结了过去一个时期的成绩和缺点，沿着党所指出的正确方向开始了新的战斗。目前，已有不少作家到农村去，到工厂去，深入到劳动人民的生活中去，去了解他们伟大的祖国每一块地方日新月异的变化和人民在建设社会主义事业中的丰功伟绩。这次作家联盟会议通过的一封给捷共中央的信中说：“我们团结了一切诚实的文学工作者，决心致力于克服一切存在的不良倾向，为了更坚决地以我们社会主义文学的优良传统，帮助党和人民完成社会主义建设事业，我们一定要更好地掌握马克思列宁主义思想，更紧密地与劳动人民联系。”这是捷克斯洛伐克文学界所表示的决心与愿望，也是捷克斯洛伐克社会主义的文学事业将更加丰富繁荣的保证。
    高歌今日的生活和战斗
    “生活在今天的时代，我们的社会、我们的生活充满了人民的欢乐和幸福，我们要尽情歌颂今日的生活和战斗，要用音乐鼓舞人们建设祖国、永远前进的热情。”这是捷克斯洛伐克科学院长、著名的文艺理论家尼耶德利在最近举行的捷克斯洛伐克作曲家协会第二届代表大会上说的一段话。音乐工作者们用热烈的掌声接受了他的期望。他们在会上都表示要以继续发扬捷克斯洛伐克音乐和人民密切联系的优良传统，掀起一个音乐创作的新高潮。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民是一个十分爱好音乐的民族，他们不但能歌善舞，而且一般都有较高的欣赏音乐的修养。无论在城市、在乡村、在盛大的集会上、在亲友的聚会里，人们常常以歌声来表达他们最大的快乐和最深的感情。解放后，随着社会主义革命事业的胜利，生活给音乐界提出了新的课题，他们除了发扬捷克斯洛伐克音乐的优良传统外，并使音乐遵循着捷共所提出的“创作社会主义思想和民族风格的音乐”的方针前进。十年来，捷克斯洛伐克音乐家们在“作曲家们同人民在一起”和“我们的音乐为保卫和平而战”等口号的鼓舞下，写出了许多充满时代感情的新歌曲。如多比亚士的“建设祖国、增强和平”，杨·赛德的“人民！你们要警惕”等都深受人民喜爱，并曾分别获得和平奖金和国家奖金。
    捷克斯洛伐克音乐界的前进也不是一帆风顺的，在1956年现代修正主义思潮的影响下，捷克斯洛伐克音乐家中出现了一些轻视民间音乐和群众歌曲的错误倾向，并出现了一些不健康的歌曲。这时捷共和作曲家协会及时提出了“团结一切音乐工作者，防止修正主义进攻”的口号。在最近召开的作曲家协会代表大会上更深入具体地批判了修正主义者所鼓吹的纯音乐和纯艺术观点，尼耶德利说得好，这种修正主义观点就是企图要让艺术家们成为生活和战斗中的逃兵。他指出，音乐家们应到工厂去，到农村去，那里有取之不尽的、值得歌颂的题材。在这次大会上，音乐工作者们都认识到这些创作思想上存在的错误和缺点是如何地损害了社会主义的文化事业，他们向全体音乐界提出了响亮的号召：坚决回击一切修正主义的影响，提高马克思列宁主义的创作水平，要用一切方法巩固音乐家和人民之间的联系，写出更多真正符合我们这个伟大时代的劳动人民思想感情的作品。目前，捷克斯洛伐克音乐界正在恢复过去音乐家们和人民保持联系的一些传统形式，如组织文化劳动队，进行文化义务劳动等，真正深入到人民生活中去，让音乐发挥鼓舞人民教育人民的作用。音乐家们都以捷克斯洛伐克艺术家阿列斯的一句名言“我不为艺术服务，我要用艺术为人民服务”作为彼此的鼓励。
    银幕上插红旗
    1958年是捷克斯洛伐克电影事业六十周年，在回溯捷克斯洛伐克电影事业所走过的这一段漫长道路时，人们清楚地看到，只有在解放后，捷克斯洛伐克电影事业才真正获得了巨大的发展和具有了崭新的内容。捷共十分重视电影对人民的教育作用，目前在捷克斯洛伐克有三千五百所电影院，几乎遍布城市和乡村。而且从1948年以来，每年都在工业城市举办工人电影节，1951年来又开始在农村组织“乡村之春”的电影节，为工人农民放映最优秀的电影，特别是利用这个机会组织工人和农民座谈，倾听他们的意见。这样就使电影事业保持了同劳动人民的密切联系。
    捷克斯洛伐克电影在人民生活中有着极大的影响，获得了人民普遍的赞扬。但观众对一些影片也提出了批评。正像在今年2月举行的第一届全国电影节的座谈会上，一个老工人说，“我喜欢这样的电影，当我看过后，我觉得我必须更好地工作和生活。”这正是无数劳动人民对电影的要求。
    为了使电影事业能跟上人民和社会的要求，这次电影节是在“争取电影创作更密切地与人民生活相结合”的口号下举行的，经过一番热烈的讨论，总结了成绩，并对电影创作思想上的一些错误倾向进行了尖锐的批评，指出了今后电影创作的方向。这次会议指出，由于电影创作思想上的一些缺点，因此产生了一些与时代和人民思想感情背道而驰的影片，在一定程度上公开地表现出修正主义的倾向。在这次会上观众们和电影工作者的座谈中，都肯定了影片要反映现代生活，而最重要的是要反映现代生活的主流，那就是劳动人民、社会主义的建设事业。电影工作者们表示一定要以党性的原则去创造社会主义新人的典型，让观众们在银幕上看到更多的社会主义的英雄人物，和祖国社会主义建设的宏伟景象。捷克斯洛伐克广播电台评论这次会议时说，这次电影节是捷克斯洛伐克电影创作事业的里程碑。
