Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Now, based on my recent inspection of rural areas in Sichuan and personal experiences, I would like to make the following speech for your consideration and correction!

The rural areas of Sichuan after the people's commune movement, like all parts of the country, have achieved a new historical leap forward. Since liberation, I have visited rural Sichuan almost once or twice a year, and each time I see significant changes. The three counties I visited this time, Jianyang, Lezhi, and Anyue, have undergone a completely new transformation. Under the leadership of the Party, millions of peasants, holding high the red flag of the General Line for Socialist Construction, are launching a comprehensive battle against nature with the momentum of a mighty army. They are marching towards agriculture and industry, possessing both soaring enthusiasm and endless wisdom, producing vigorously and living happily. The entire countryside has become a vibrant picture of progress. With boundless excitement, I applaud the unprecedented great victories achieved by our country in 1958, hail the even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward that has begun in 1959, and celebrate the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune system.

1958 Wrote an Epic of Heroism
1959 Greater Enthusiasm and Red Hearts Overcoming Heaven

The peasants of Sichuan, like peasants across the country, under the leadership of the Party, wrote an epic of heroism on the agricultural production front in 1958. Taking the increase in major agricultural products in the three counties we visited as an example, in 1958, Jianyang's total grain output was 1.5 billion jin, a doubling of production compared to 1957. The cotton planting area was 600,000 mu, with a yield of 105 jin per mu, and a total output of 630,000 dan, a doubling of production compared to 1957. Lezhi and Anyue are areas with poor soil in Sichuan Province, but last year's agricultural production also saw tremendous growth. Lezhi's total grain output was over 640 million jin, an increase of 56.78% compared to 1957, and the total cotton output was 7.3 million jin, an increase of 47.75% compared to 1957. Anyue's total grain output was over 1.17 billion jin, an increase of 71% compared to 1957. The total cotton output was 1.74 million jin, an increase of 40.6% compared to 1957; other crops also saw significant increases. Such a high rate of increase is truly a miracle in the history of agricultural production.

Now, these heroes who are conquering nature are following the victorious path of 1958, leaping forward again and again. Their spirit is even more heroic, and their goals are even more ambitious. Based on the active implementation of the principle of "less planting, high yield, more harvest," the agricultural production plans put forward by the three counties all show significant increases. The correctness of the "less planting, high yield, more harvest" principle can be seen from the example of Anyue County. In 1959, the county's total cultivated land area was only 1.45 million mu, a slight decrease compared to 1958. However, with effort, the grain output can reach 2.5 billion jin, an increase of 112% compared to 1958, with an average yield of about 2,000 jin per mu; 300,000 mu of wheat may reach a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. In addition, efforts will be made this year to overcome the challenge of coarse grains, requiring that fine grains reach 82% of the total grain output. If all the plans of the Annong Commune in Anyue County are realized this year, the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations can reach 585,000 yuan. Based on the commune's 1,100 people, the average annual income per person can reach about 500 yuan. We are truly proud of such a great leap forward!

The peasants of Sichuan under the leadership of the Party are not only daring to think, speak, and act, but they are also able to do what they think and say. The fundamental guarantee of their victory is the leadership of the Party. The Party gave them and educated them to use the invincible weapons, which are the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural increase and the vigorous technical revolution. They summon up the revolutionary enthusiasm and grasp these two major weapons tightly to conquer nature and achieve an even greater leap forward than last year.

From the three counties we visited this time, we can see that under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of peasants are implementing the agricultural "Eight-Point Charter" with extremely vigorous fighting spirit. The countless heroic deeds they have displayed are deeply moving to us. All counties attach great importance to soil improvement and make the greatest efforts to engage in deep plowing. For example, in Tongxian Commune of Anyue County, everyone has a "determination ruler," plowing one mu and measuring one mu. They do not stop until they meet the standard. Their wheat fields are generally plowed to a depth of one chi five cun, and some of the satellite fields reach five or six chi. This is an arduous struggle. Despite its arduousness, it cannot defeat these heroes who strive to be the best. Some commune members said, "Not afraid of wind and rain, a red heart overcomes heaven. Improve the bad land, and the output will increase several times over." All counties are vigorously engaged in manure accumulation campaigns. The battle cry they put forward is: "Must accumulate fertilizer when available, must compete for every jin and liang." Men and women, young and old, all work together. Some Party secretaries carry dung baskets when they go out to meetings, picking up manure while walking. Several thousand jin, tens of thousands of jin, and up to 300,000 jin of fertilizer are applied per mu. In addition, various fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are used reasonably according to the characteristics of the soil and crops, so that the fertilizer effect is fully exerted. All counties seize the agricultural season. The masses said: "Seizing time is like seizing gold; we must fight time with our lives," "We must ride a rocket, not a rickshaw." In order to save time and increase cotton production, Jianyang Cotton Feng Commune adopted the "fire-heated nursery method," which allows transplanting in seven days, advancing this year's cotton planting by two seasons. In this way, they can seize summer peaches, autumn peaches, and greatly increase cotton production. They are not only fast, but also do well. For example, Anyue County proposed "Eight Don'ts for Planting Wheat" (1. Don't plant if deep plowing is less than one chi five cun; 2. Don't plant if less than 1,000 jin of smoked soil chemical fertilizer, 50,000 jin of slag fertilizer, 100,000 jin of smoked fertilizer, or half a jin of nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer are not applied; 3. Don't plant if there are no irrigation conditions or it is inconvenient to irrigate; 4. Don't plant if the seeds have not been treated; 5. Don't plant if there are not enough 35 to 40 jin of seeds; 6. Don't plant if the soil is not fine; 7. Don't plant at the wrong time according to the characteristics of various seeds; 8. Don't plant if there is no acceptance certificate). Such strict requirements for technical specifications lay a good foundation for high yields and good harvests. All counties have paid attention to suiting measures to local conditions and arranging production according to the soil. Some communes have basically realized the regionalization of planting. In this way, thoughts are concentrated, labor is concentrated, which is convenient for management, conducive to summarizing a set of experiences in technology, and also facilitates the arrangement of late crops. They not only plow deeply and plant well, but also manage the fields well. The communes we saw conscientiously implemented the management responsibility system, dividing teams into areas, dividing fields and setting production targets, contracting to individuals, and managing to the end. Some communes manage wheat, going to the fields three times a day, checking in the morning for signs of lodging, at noon for pests, and in the evening to see if growth is normal. They regard crops as life. Some communes implemented "camping in the fields, cadres living and dying with the seedlings, sharing weal and woe." These heroic struggles determined that this year's agricultural production, like industry, will have an even greater leap forward, and results have already been achieved. The spring crops we saw in the counties this time are growing luxuriantly and sturdily. In particular, the wheat and rapeseed in Anyue, in every ditch and dam, are as dense as forests, with stalks taller than people. Looking left, it is a green ocean; looking right, it is a golden world. Our view, like that of the old farmers there, is that "these are the best crops since ancient times."

All of the above fully reflects the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune system. Under the former small agricultural cooperatives, it would have been impossible for such a great leap forward to occur. From this, I have deeply and concretely realized that the relations of production must be adapted to the development of the productive forces. This is an irrefutable truth. Those who argue that the people's communes are "running too fast" should bow to the truth.

Flowers of Technological Innovation Can Be Seen Everywhere Displaying the Prospects for Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification

During our inspection, there was another important aspect that was also very encouraging to us. That is: the mass movement of technological revolution is being carried out universally in the countryside like a surging tide. Under the education of the Party, millions of peasants have broken down superstitions, liberated their minds, and summed up the experience of production struggles. Countless inventions and creations have emerged, and flowers of technological revolution can be seen everywhere. On the way from Chengdu to Jianyang, those who crushed stones adopted the method of hoisting ropes to raise and lower the stone hammers, which reduced the intensity of labor and improved work efficiency. From Jianyang to Lezhi, the springboard on the Tuo River ferry implemented automated local methods, reducing manpower and saving time. In the battle of "Four Autumns" last year, some communes trial-produced rope-drawn deep plows, which could plow to a depth of one chi five cun, and achieved "three no-go to fields": no people go to fields, no cattle go to fields, and no fertilizer go to fields; In terms of water conservancy construction, all counties have achieved great results. For example, Jianyang County has basically realized four mechanizations: rapid stream pump wheel mechanization, slow stream climbing wheel mechanization, ancient well spring pond liberation style water wheel mechanization, and water truck cart mechanization. They comprehensively use natural laws to conquer nature and make it serve agricultural production. They said: "These methods, although local, solve the problem." The brilliant achievements of the technological revolution are also concentrated in the successful development of the "Three-Five" movement (five machine tools; five kinds of tools such as thread die, vise, hacksaw, file, bench drill; five kinds of power such as water, fire, livestock, wind, and gas). Since the central government issued the call to carry out the "Three-Five" movement in rural areas, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the masses of peasants throughout the province to actively invest in this movement, and it quickly flourished in various counties. The three counties we inspected this time were all riding on the "Three-Five" movement, galloping on the broad road of agricultural industrialization and commune industrialization. Let's take the example of Lezhi to see the general situation. Lezhi's machine industry was originally basically a blank slate. Before the "Three-Five" movement was launched, there were only ten iron production cooperatives (groups) with 271 ironworkers in the county. In addition to two dilapidated machine tools, seven vices and other simple tools, there were only a few red furnaces. The county did not produce coal and iron, and the conditions such as raw materials and technology were very poor. It should be said that the "Three-Five" movement was started from scratch on this basis. Under the leadership of the Lezhi County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the masses acted in unison, adhering to the principle of self-reliance, making do with whatever was available, taking materials locally, starting with local methods, "not looking upward with both eyes" and "not looking outward with both hands." If there were no raw materials, they mobilized the masses to donate steel and smelt steel. If there were no qualified equipment, they adopted the "three substitutions" method: using non-metal to replace metal, using small to replace large, using thin to replace thick, using broken clock and phonograph springs to replace hacksaws, using pot menders' openers to replace planers, using grinding wheels to replace milling machines, using hand drills to replace drilling machines, using emery stones to replace grinding wheels, and using hand files to replace original vehicles, and they can still create various machines; if there is not enough power, then use five kinds of power in parallel: electricity, water, biogas, human power, and animal power; If the technical force is insufficient, implement the return of technology, mobilize demobilized soldiers and school teachers who understand technology, and also use methods such as inviting in to teach, sending out to learn, and training apprentices by masters and old hands to cultivate. When the movement entered its climax and everyone got on the horse and attacked the technical fortress, some workers were studying in their dreams at night, shouting: "I have a solution, I have a solution." After a tenacious battle, a glorious victory was won. From the launch of the "Three-Five" movement in October last year to the present, the county has manufactured 340 machine tools and 5,584 tools; the May 1st Machinery Factory in the county seat is already equivalent to a medium-sized factory; it has equipped six district farm tool factories, 58 township and commune farm tool factories, and 388 team farm tool repair stations, basically forming a farm tool manufacturing network; it has manufactured a large number of machines and equipment in five aspects: agricultural product processing, water conservancy construction, transportation, cultivation, and basic construction. At the same time, it has also manufactured more than 150 kinds of new-style farm tools, improved farm tools, and tools, totaling more than 520,000 pieces, which has increased work efficiency by three to five times and saved more than 56 million man-days of labor, which is equivalent to the labor of 180,000 people, accounting for 36% of the county's annual labor; the technical team has grown stronger, from the original 271 old-fashioned ironworkers to 442 turners, 215 fitters, 799 forgers, 182 sand molders, and 3,868 carpenters, of which 80% have basically mastered the technology. With the successful development of the "Three-Five" movement, the county is vigorously grasping "six mechanizations": deep plowing mechanization, rice transplanter mechanization, combine harvester mechanization, thresher mechanization, cart mechanization, and ball bearing mechanization, of which cart mechanization has basically been realized. This has played a huge role in the greater leap forward in 1959 and opened up the road to agricultural mechanization. The masses reflected: "New-style machines have come to the countryside, and the backward look has changed. Liberating labor to catch up with the advanced and developing production is guaranteed."

The vigorous development of the technical innovation movement in the above three counties, especially the achievements of the "Three-Five" movement in Lezhi, demonstrates the brilliant prospects of our country's industrialization, commune industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and electrification. Here, I further realize the great significance of the Party's proposal of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. The comprehensive socialist leap forward must be a combination of revolutionary enthusiasm and technological innovation. Only by being both Wu Song and Lu Ban can we complete such a great task. Some people only see strength but not wisdom, only see hard work but not recuperation, and think that "the great leap forward is too tense, unbearable, and the string will break if tightened again." This is really only knowing one thing and not knowing the other. The great leap forward is tense, and tension is not a bad thing. Tension can accelerate our country's change of its "poor and blank" face. The broad masses of working people understand "three years of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness," so their enthusiasm is soaring; our tension is a tension with recuperation, a tension combined with intelligence, so the broad masses of working people are not exhausted by the great leap forward, but are becoming more and more energetic, high-spirited, and marching forward triumphantly.

Socialist Democratic Life Activates the Entire Countryside The Ideals of Thousands of Years Have Begun to Become a Reality

During this inspection, we were also pleased to see that socialist democratic life is active throughout the countryside. On the one hand, the people's communes practice a high degree of democracy: all major matters in the commune are discussed by the masses; the management organization is democratically elected; income distribution is reviewed by the masses; and production measures and public welfare undertakings are all ideas put forward by everyone. The new democratic methods of great airing of views, great debate, and big-character posters are widely used, full of vitality everywhere, and promote the continuous leap forward of socialism. For example, during the rectification of the Jianyang Liberation People's Commune, these democratic methods were implemented in conjunction with the study of the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The masses put forward a total of 3,572 opinions, including six aspects: policy implementation, production measures, distribution methods, business management, life and welfare, and cadre style. The result of promoting democracy is to unify policy understanding, further strengthen the relationship between leaders and the masses, improve the unity between cadres and the masses, encourage production enthusiasm, and do a good job in various tasks. The masses said: "Now we are the masters of our own affairs, everyone discusses and works together, and one year is better than a hundred years of spring." On the other hand, the people's communes implement a high degree of centralization. The masses enthusiastically support the Party, follow the Party wholeheartedly, and listen to the Party's words. In conquering nature, the command is unified, the actions are swift, and the fighting spirit is extremely strong. The masses said: "Millions of troops go to the battlefield, fighting both production and steel. The bugle sounds and the mountains shake. We will not give up until we win a complete victory." Some communes were in the midst of a major battle for steel last year. The commune wanted to transfer 3,000 people to the mountains. They were notified at 6 pm that day and gathered and set off at midnight; some communes in the major battle of "Four Autumns" last year only took ten days to deeply plow more than 3,000 mu of small spring land to a depth of one chi five cun to two chi, and completed the preliminary earthwork of the community roadway in seven days, and completed the climbing wheel mechanization of hilly land in twelve days. When we were in Anyue, a strong wind and rain blew down part of the wheat one night. The next morning, an army of labor set out and in less than a day, they all helped up the fallen wheat, so that the crops were not damaged much. Although the enemies of nature are so fierce, they are quickly conquered by these heroes. Another example, which impressed me the most, was when we went from Jianyang to Lezhi, we saw a transport team composed of thousands of chicken carts and racks, walking one after another, a quiet silence, only the sound of wheels and the footsteps of people, such discipline is as solemn as the workers standing in front of the machine. Every people's commune in the countryside is an organized and disciplined agricultural production army. With this unparalleled and huge force, it guarantees the leap forward in the agricultural front again and again.

During this inspection, we saw that the lives of millions of peasants have undergone a great historical change. The implementation of the distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system, and eating without money, has freed the broad masses of peasants from the tragic situation of worrying about food and drink for thousands of years, and men, women, old and young are all happy. They said: "In the past, there were seven things to open the door, oil, salt, firewood, rice, sauce, vinegar, and tea, but now there are three things to open the door, morning exercises, washing face and brushing teeth, open the pot to eat, and get paid every month." Public welfare undertakings are rapidly and massively launched. Taking Lezhi County as an example, in less than half a year, it has set up 4,036 public canteens, 6,627 nurseries, 1,741 kindergartens, and 137 homes for the elderly. We visited several public canteens in the three counties and had meals. The meals were well-managed, full, warm, and hygienic. We also visited many nurseries and kindergartens. The children inside were all very strong, with rosy faces and a healthy color. Scabies, which were commonly prevalent in rural areas in the past, were not seen this time. We saw many children who wanted to be held and told stories, innocent and lively, and very cute. We are very happy to see these excellent communist successors growing up in a happy paradise. We also visited many homes for the elderly. These helpless old people are given special care, living better than ordinary people, and are given more fine grains and meat. The commune also added new cotton clothes and quilts to some of the elderly. They all regard the homes for the elderly as "lifeboats." An old woman in her 70s in the Chengguan Commune Nursing Home in Anyue County said excitedly: "I haven't had a new quilt since I got married, but now I have it." Before leaving, she repeatedly asked us to thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in Beijing on her behalf. Rural public welfare undertakings are still in the initial stage, but they are already on such a scale. In the future, with the development of production, the lives of peasants will inevitably become more and more happy. The ideals issued by our ancestors thousands of years ago: "The old will be supported, the young will be raised, the strong will be employed, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, and disabled will be cared for," have begun to become a reality in the rural areas after the people's communes.

After the rural communes, the feudal patriarchal system has been destroyed, and new democratic and united families have been gradually established, and the relationship between people has greatly changed. We learned about many moving examples this time. Some couples who were going to divorce did not divorce after the commune; some sisters-in-law who had not spoken for more than ten years spoke after the commune. In particular, the broad masses of rural women have been liberated from the trivial housework, have participated in social labor, and have added a huge new force to the production front. At the same time, they have also changed their economic status and completely broken away from the shackles of feudal remnants, so they feel extremely happy and express their heartfelt thanks to the Party. A big-character poster written by a woman in the Lezhi Red Flag Commune said: "Kitchen, stove, sewing, washing, busy all year round, now I don't care about these things, pick up the hoe and go to the battlefield, women are liberated, thanks to the Communist Party." The broad masses of peasants have experienced from their own experiences that "communism is paradise, and the people's commune builds a bridge." A peasant's song in Lezhi County expresses the feelings and wishes of hundreds of millions of working people: "The phoenix calls, the red flag flutters, the east wind blows like a sea tide, the people's commune builds a fairy bridge, communism must arrive." All these facts powerfully answered the slanderous remarks of Dulles and his ilk against the people's communes.

The soaring development of the motherland's construction, the unprecedented leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the huge improvement and improvement of the material and spiritual life of the broad masses of people have completely changed the historical face of our country. It is truly "how many days and months have passed, and the mountains and rivers cannot be recognized again." We are infinitely happy and encouraged to be able to live in this great country.

The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all undertakings in our country. The unprecedented and great leap forward in 1958 that we saw in the rural areas, the great achievements that have been made since 1959, and the establishment, development, and consolidation of the people's communes are all victories of the Party's leadership, victories of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, and victories of the Party's entire set of "two-legged" walking policies. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China resolutely implements the policy of "grasping tightly from the beginning to the end," which has played a huge role in promoting the comprehensive socialist leap forward in Sichuan. From the provincial, prefectural, and county (city) committees to the basic-level Party committees, the secretaries are in charge and the entire Party is mobilized on all fronts. Cadres and the masses plant experimental fields together, leading and encouraging millions of people to move forward, overcome all unimaginable difficulties, and break through all difficult fortresses. The historic great victory was won from the hard struggle. The broad masses of people in Sichuan reflected: the Party is our strength, our victory, our happiness, our everything. We must always follow the Party to the victory of socialism and the victory of communism.

Our great motherland has entered a higher stage of historical development. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country are riding the long wind and breaking through thousands of miles of waves, everyone is giving full play to their energy and striving for the top, creating a new and greater history. The soaring development of the situation requires us bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals to accelerate our self-transformation in order to better serve the socialist cause. As a member of a democratic party, I must follow the victorious road pointed out by the General Line for Socialist Construction under the leadership of the Party, forge ahead courageously, strengthen self-transformation, and actively lead and help all those who can be united, in order to further consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland than last year, and strive to achieve a double harvest of service and transformation in the great 1959.

Finally, I wish the conference success and comrades good health!

    走三县　访新村　赞公社
    刘文辉代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    现在，我就这次视察四川农村的情况，结合个人的一些体会，作如下的发言，请予指正！
    人民公社化后的四川农村，同全国各地一样，实现了一个新的历史跃进。解放后，我在四川，几乎每年都要去农村一、两次，看到的总是一次比一次大不相同。这次视察的简阳、乐至、安岳三县又完全换了一副崭新的面貌，千百万农民，在党的领导下，高举社会主义建设总路线的红旗，以千军万马的声势，向大自然开展全面的战斗。他们既向农业进军，又向工业进军，既有冲天的干劲，又有无穷无尽的智慧，既奋勇地生产，又欢乐地生活，整个农村变成了一幅万马奔腾的跃进图。我怀着无比兴奋的心情，为我国一九五八年取得的史无前例的伟大胜利而欢呼，为一九五九年开始到来的更大更好更全面的跃进而欢呼，为人民公社制度的无比优越性而欢呼。
    一九五八年写出一部英雄史诗
    一九五九年干劲更大红心胜天
    四川农民同全国农民一样，在党的领导下，一九五八年在农业生产战线上写出了一部英雄的史诗。以我们到过的三县几项主要农产品的增长的情况来说，一九五八年，简阳粮食总产量为十五亿斤，比一九五七年增产一倍，棉花种植面积六十万亩，亩产一百零五斤，总产量为六十三万担，比一九五七年增产一倍。乐至和安岳是四川省土壤硗薄之区，去年的农业生产也有巨大的增长。乐至粮食总产量为六亿四千多万斤，比一九五七年增产百分之五十六点七八，棉花总产量为七百三十万斤，比一九五七年增产百分之四十七点七五。安岳粮食总产量为十一亿七千多万斤，比一九五七年增产百分之七十一。棉花总产量为一百七十四万斤，比一九五七年增产百分之四十点六；其他农作物也都有很大的增长。像这样高的增产速度，真是农业生产史上的奇迹。
    现在，我们这些征服自然的英雄们，正踏着一九五八年的胜利道路，跃进再跃进。他们的气概更豪迈，奋斗的目标更宏伟。在积极贯彻“少种、高产、多收”方针的基础上，三个县提出的农业生产计划都有很大的增长。从安岳的例子就可以看到“少种、高产、多收”方针的正确。安岳县一九五九年全县耕地面积只种植一百四十五万亩，比一九五八年虽然略有减少。但是，粮食产量经过努力争取，反而可达到二十五亿斤，比一九五八年增加百分之一百一十二，平均每亩产量二千斤左右；小麦三十万亩，可能达到亩产一千斤。此外还要在今年内过好细粮关，要求细粮达到粮食总产量的百分之八十二。安岳县安农公社，今年规划如果全部实现，农副业总收入可达五十八万五千元，按公社一千一百多人计算，每人全年平均收入可达五百元左右。我们真为这样伟大的跃进而感到自豪！
    党领导下的四川农民，不仅敢想、敢说、敢做，并且想得到说得出，就一定做得到。他们胜利的根本保证，是党的领导，党给了他们并教育他们使用的战无不胜的武器，就是农业增产的“八字宪法”和大闹技术革命。他们鼓起冲天的革命干劲，紧紧地掌握这两大武器，去征服自然，实现比去年更大更好的跃进。
    从我们这次到过的三县来看，广大农民在党的领导下，都是以极其旺盛的斗志，来贯彻农业“八字宪法”，表现出来的无数英雄事迹，使我们十分感动。各县都很重视土壤改良，付出最大的努力搞深耕，例如：安岳县通贤公社，每人都有一把“决心尺”，翻一亩，量一亩，不到标准就补课。他们的麦子田，一般深耕到一尺五，卫星田有的达到了五、六尺。这是一个艰巨的斗争。尽管艰巨，却难不倒这些力争上游的英雄们。有的社员说，“不怕风和雨，红心胜过天，改良坏土地，产量翻几番。”各县都大搞积肥运动，他们提出的战斗口号是：“有肥必积，斤两必争”，男女老少一齐动手，有的党委书记出门开会，也是提着鸳篼，一面走路，一面拣粪。每亩施肥上几万斤，十几万斤，最高的上三十万斤。并且按照土壤和农作物的特性，对氮、磷、钾各种肥料，作了合理使用，使肥效发挥尽致。各县都抓紧了农时，群众说：“抢时如抢金，要与时间把命拼”，“要乘火箭，不坐鸡公车”。简阳棉丰公社为了争取时间，提高棉花产量，采取“火温床育苗法”，七天就可移植，把今年棉花的种植提早了两个季节。这样就可以抓夏桃、伏桃、秋桃，大大地提高了棉花产量。他们不仅是抓得快，而且做得好，例如安岳县种植小麦，提出了“八不种”（1．深耕不到一尺五不种；2．烟熏土化肥不到一千斤，渣肥不到五万斤，烟熏肥不到十万斤，固氮菌肥不到半斤不种；3．没有灌溉条件或者不便灌溉的不种；4．种籽没有经过处理不种；5．种籽不足三十五到四十斤不种；6．土不细不种；7．根据各种种子的特性不适时不种；8．没有验收证不种）。对技术规格的要求这样严格，就为高产丰收打下了良好基础。各县都注意到了因地制宜，根据土壤布置生产，有的公社基本上实现了种植区域化。这样，就思想集中，劳力集中，既便于管理，又利于在技术上总结一套经验，还便于后期作物的安排。他们不仅耕得深种得好，同时对田间管理也搞得好，我们所看到的公社，认真执行了管理责任制，分队划片，分田定产，包干到人，一管到底。有的公社管理小麦，一天三到田，早上看有无倒伏征象，中午看有无虫害，晚上看是否生长正常。他们视庄稼如生命，有的公社实行了“田间扎营，干部与苗床同生死，共患难”。这些英勇的斗争，决定了今年的农业生产，将和工业一样地更大更好的跃进，已经取得成效。我们这次所看到的各县的小春作物，都长得繁茂茁壮，特别是安岳一沟一坝的小麦和油菜，枝叶成林，秆高过人，左看是一个绿色的海洋，右看是一个黄金世界。我们同那里老农的看法一样，“这是从古以来没有过的好庄稼。”
    以上这一切，都充分反映了人民公社制度的无比优越性。在过去小型的农业合作社下面，是不可能出现这样伟大的跃进局面。从这里使我深刻和具体地认识到，生产关系一定要适合生产力发展，这是一条颠扑不破的真理。那些议论人民公社“跑得太快了”的人们应向真理低头了。
    到处都能看到技术革新的花朵  展示农业机械化电气化的前景
    在我们这次视察中，还有一个重要的方面，也是使我们十分鼓舞的。这就是：全民性的技术革命运动，像汹涌澎湃的怒潮一样，在农村普遍开展着。千百万农民，在党的教育下，破除迷信，解放思想，总结生产斗争的经验，出现了无数的发明创造，到处都可以看到技术革命的花朵。我们从成都到简阳途中，那些捶碎石的人们，采用了吊绳升降捶石法，减轻了劳动强度，提高了工作效率；从简阳到乐至，沱江轮渡上的跳板，实行了土法自动化，减少了人力，节省了时间；在去年大战“四秋”中，有的公社试制成了绳索牵引深耕犁，可以深耕到一尺五，并且做到“三不下田”，人不下田，牛不下田，施肥不下田；在水利建设方面，各县都获得了巨大的成绩，例如简阳全县基本上实现了四化，激流筒车化，缓流爬车化，古井泉凼解放式水车化，运水车子化。他们全面地利用自然规律去征服自然，使之为农业生产服务。他们说：“这些办法，土虽土，解决问题”。技术革命的光辉成就，还集中表现在“三五”运动（五部机床；套丝板，老虎钳，钢锯，钢锉，台钻等五种工具；水、火、畜、风、气等五种动力）的胜利发展上。自中央提出在农村中开展机械工业的“三五”运动的号召后，中共四川省委动员全省农民群众积极投入这个运动，很快就在各县如火如荼地开展起来。我们这次视察的三个县，都是跨着“三五”运动这匹骏马，向农业工业化，公社工业化的广阔道路上奔驰。我们举出乐至的例，就可以看到一般，乐至的机械工业原来基本上是一张白纸。在“三五”运动开展前，全县仅有十个铁业生产社（组）铁工二百七十一人。除了两部破旧车床、七把老虎钳等简易工具外，就只有几盘红炉。该县又不产煤铁，原材料和技术等条件都很差。在这样基础上来开展“三五”运动，应当说是白手兴家。在中共乐至县委的领导下，广大群众一致行动起来，本着自力更生的原则，因陋就简，就地取材，土法先上马“两眼不向上”“两手不向外”。没有原材料，就发动群众献钢铁、炼钢铁，没有合格的器材，就采用“三代”的办法：以非金属代金属，以小代大，以薄代厚，用破钟、留声机发条代替钢锯，以补锅匠的起子代替刨床，用沙轮磨代替铣床，用手摇钻代替钻床，用泡沙石代替沙轮，用手锉代替元车，一样能创造出各种机器来；没有足够的动力，就电力、水力、沼气、人力、畜力五种并用；技术力量不足，就实行技术归队，动员懂技术的复员军人和学校教员，还用请进来教、派出去学、以师傅带徒弟，以老手带新手的办法来培养。当运动进入高潮，个个上马，向技术堡垒进攻时，有的工人在晚上做梦的时候都在钻研，高呼：“我有办法，我有办法。”经过一场顽强的战斗，赢得了光辉的胜利。从去年十月开展“三五”运动起到现在，全县已制造出来了机床三百四十部，工具五千五百八十四件；县城内的五一机械制造厂已经相当于一个中型工厂；装备了区农具厂六个，乡、公社农具厂五十八个，队农具修配站三百八十八个，基本上组成了农具制造网；在农产品加工、水利建设、运输、耕作、基本建设五个方面，制造出了大量的机器设备，同时还制造出了新式农具、改良农具和工具一百五十多种，共五十二万多件，提高了工效三倍至五倍，节约了劳动力五千六百多万个，等于十八万人的劳动量，占该县全年劳动量的百分之三十六；技术队伍已经壮大起来，由原来的二百七十一个旧式铁工，发展到车工四百四十二人，钳工二百一十五人，锻工七百九十九人，翻砂工一百八十二人，木工三千八百六十八人，其中百分之八十基本上掌握了技术。随着“三五”运动的胜利发展，该县正大抓“六化”，深耕犁化，插秧机化，收割机化，脱粒机化，车子化，滚珠轴承化，其中，车子化已基本实现了。这对于一九五九年的更大跃进，发挥了巨大的作用，为农业机械化开辟了道路。群众反映说：“新式机器下了乡，落后面貌变了样，解放劳力赶先进，发展生产有保障。”
    上述三县技术革新运动的蓬勃发展，特别是乐至“三五”运动的成就，展示了我们国家工业化，公社工业化，农业机械化，电气化的光辉前景。在这里我进一步认识到党提出技术革命和文化革命的伟大意义。全面的社会主义大跃进必须是革命干劲与技术革新相结合，既是武松，又是鲁班，才可能完成这样伟大的任务，有些人只看到力不看到智，只看苦战不看休整，就认为“大跃进太紧张，吃不消，再紧弦都会拉断了”，这真是只知其一，不知其二。大跃进是紧张的，紧张不是坏事，紧张可以加速我国改变“一穷二白”的面貌，广大劳动人民懂得“三年苦战，万年幸福”，所以干劲冲天；我们的紧张，是又休整的紧张，是与智力相结合的紧张，所以广大劳动人民不是被大跃进累垮了，而是越干越有劲，意气风发，高歌猛进。
    社会主义民主生活活跃整个农村  几千年来的理想开始变成了现实
    在这次视察中，我们还高兴地看到，社会主义的民主生活，活跃在整个农村。人民公社一方面实行着高度的民主：社内的一切重大事情，都通过了群众的讨论；管理机构是由民主选举；收入分配要经群众审议；生产措施和公共福利事业，都是大家来出主意。大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的新型民主方式被普遍采用，到处充满活力，推动着社会主义的不断跃进。如简阳解放人民公社在整社期间结合学习党的八届六中全会文件，实行了这一民主方式，群众共放出了三千五百七十二条意见，其中包括政策执行、生产措施、分配办法、经营管理、生活福利、干部作风等六个方面。发扬民主的结果，统一了政策认识，更加密切了领导与群众的关系，搞好了干部与群众的团结，鼓舞了生产热情，做好了各项工作。群众说：“现在当家做主人，大家商量大家干，一年胜过百年春”。人民公社另一方面实行高度的集中，群众热烈地拥护党，一心一意跟着党走，听党的话。在征服大自然中，指挥是统一的，行动是敏捷的，斗志是无比坚强的，群众说：“千军万马上战场，既战生产又战钢，军号一声山摇动，不获全胜心不甘”。有的公社去年大战钢铁，社里要调三千人上山，当天下午六时通知，半夜就集中出发了；有的公社在去年大战“四秋”中，只有十天就深耕了一尺五到两尺的三千多亩小春地，七天就完成了全社车道的初步土方，十二天就完成丘陵地的爬车化。我们在安岳的时候，有一晚大风大雨吹倒了一部分小麦，第二天一早，一支劳动大军就出动了，不到一天的功夫，就把所有倒伏的小麦一齐扶了起来，使庄稼没有受到多大损伤。尽管自然界的敌人那样凶顽，很快地就为这些英雄们所征服。还有一个事例，对我的印象最深，我们从简阳到乐至去，在途中看到一支由成千辆的鸡公车和架架车组成的运输队伍，鱼贯而行，一片清风哑静，只听见车轮声和人流的脚步声，这样的纪律如同站在机器面前的工人一样的严肃。农村每个人民公社，都是有组织有纪律的农业产业军。有了这个无比巨大的力量，就保证了农业战线上的跃进再跃进。
    在这次视察中我们看到了千百万农民的生活发生了一个伟大的历史性的变化。工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度的实行，吃饭不要钱，使广大农民摆脱了几千年愁吃愁喝的悲惨境遇，男女老少皆大欢喜。他们说：“从前开门七件事，油、盐、柴、米、酱、醋、茶，而今开门三件事，早操洗脸又刷牙，揭开锅盖便吃饭，每月还把工资拿”。公共福利事业迅速地大规模兴办起来。以乐至一县来说，不到半年的时间，就办起了四千零三十六个公共食堂，六千六百二十七个托儿所，一千七百四十一个幼儿园，一百三十七个敬老院。我们在三个县里都参观了几个公共食堂，并吃过饭，伙食都办得不错，吃得饱，吃得暖，吃得卫生，每月还要打一两次“牙祭”。我们也参观了好多托儿所、幼儿园，里面的小孩，一个个都长得很结实，面容红红的，一片健康色，从前农村普遍流行的疥疮，这次一个也没有见到。我们看到了许多儿童要抱，要讲故事，天真活泼，十分可爱。我们很高兴地看到这些优秀的共产主义接班人，正在幸福的乐园中成长着。我们还参观了好多敬老院，这些无依无靠的老人们，受到了特殊的照顾，比一般住的好，分配的细粮、肉也比较多，公社还给有的老人添置了新的棉衣、棉被。他们都把敬老院看成是“救生船”。安岳县城关公社敬老院一个七十多岁的老太婆激动地说：“我出嫁还未盖过新被，现在盖上了”。临走时，一再嘱托我们到北京代她感谢共产党，感谢毛主席。农村公共福利事业还在草创时期，就有这样的规模，今后随着生产的发展，农民的日子必然越过越幸福。我们祖先在几千年前发出的理想：“老有所终，幼有所长，壮有所用，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”，在人民公社化后的农村，已开始变为现实。
    农村公社化以后，封建的家长制度被摧毁了，新的民主团结的家庭逐渐建立起来，人与人的关系已有大大的改变。我们这次了解到不少动人的事例，原来有的夫妇要离婚的，公社化后不离婚了；有的妯娌十几年不说话的，公社化讲话了。特别是广大农村妇女，从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，参加了社会劳动，一面给生产战线上增添了一支庞大的生力军，同时也使自己改变了经济地位，彻底摆脱了封建残余的束缚，因而感到万分的高兴，对党表示衷心的感谢。乐至红旗公社一个妇女写的大字报上说：“锅房灶房、缝布洗浆，一年到头都在忙，如今不管这些事，拿起锄头上战场，妇女得解放，多亏共产党。”广大农民从自己的切身经历中体验到“共产主义是天堂，人民公社架桥梁”。乐至县一个农民的歌唱，表达了亿万劳动人民的心情和愿望：“凤凰叫，红旗飘，东风吹得似海潮，人民公社架仙桥，共产主义一定到。”以上这些事实，有力地答复了杜勒斯之流诬蔑人民公社的谰言。
    祖国建设这样飞跃发展，工农业生产这样史无前例的跃进，广大人民的物质精神生活这样巨大的改善和提高，完全改变了我国的历史面貌，这真是“曾日月之几何，而江山不可复识”。我们以能生活在这伟大的国度里而感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。
    党的领导，是我们国家一切事业取得胜利的根本保证。我们在农村中看到的一九五八年的空前伟大的跃进，一九五九年以来已经取得伟大的成就，人民公社的建立发展和巩固，都是党的领导的胜利，党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，党的一整套“两条腿”走路的方针的胜利。中共四川省委坚决贯彻“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的方针，对我们四川的社会主义全面大跃进起了巨大的推动作用。从省委、地委、县（市）委直到基层党委，在各个战线上都是书记挂帅、全党动员，干部与群众一起种试验田，领导着和鼓舞着千百万群众前进，战胜了各种不可想像的困难，攻破了各种难以攻破的堡垒，从艰苦斗争中，赢得了历史性的伟大胜利。四川广大人民反映：党就是我们的力量，就是我们的胜利，就是我们的幸福，就是我们的一切，我们要永远跟着党走，走向社会主义的胜利，走向共产主义的胜利。
    我们伟大的祖国已跨入了更高的历史发展阶段，全国人民正在党的领导下，乘长风破万里浪，人人鼓足干劲、力争上游，创造新的更伟大的历史。形势飞跃的发展，要求我们资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子加速自我改造，以便更好地为社会主义事业服务。作为民主党派的一个成员，我今后一定要在党的领导下，遵循社会主义建设总路线所指引的胜利道路，奋勇前进，加强自我改造，并积极带动和帮助一切可能团结的人，为进一步巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，为实现祖国社会主义建设取得比去年更大、更好、更全面的跃进而奋斗，为争取自己在伟大的一九五九年实现服务与改造双丰收而奋斗。
    最后，祝大会成功，同志们健康！
