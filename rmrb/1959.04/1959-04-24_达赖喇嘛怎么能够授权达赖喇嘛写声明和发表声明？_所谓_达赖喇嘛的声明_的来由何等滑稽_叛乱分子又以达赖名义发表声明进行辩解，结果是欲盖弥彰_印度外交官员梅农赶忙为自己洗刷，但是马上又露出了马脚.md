Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd - According to a Mussoorie dispatch from the Indian Press Trust, Tibetan rebel elements who abducted the Dalai Lama to India read out a brief statement in Mussoorie on the 22nd, issued in the name of the Dalai Lama. This statement attempts to deny that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" disseminated by Indian foreign officials in Tezpur on April 18th was imposed on the Dalai Lama. However, this kind of defense is just a futile attempt to cover up the truth.

This statement is in response to the commentary by this newspaper's political reporter on the so-called Dalai Lama's statement on April 20th. In this commentary, the reporter pointed out that the so-called Dalai Lama's statement had many obvious loopholes, and there was reason to suspect that the statement was not the Dalai Lama's own, but was imposed on him by others. The statement issued again in the Dalai Lama's name on the 22nd did not provide any answers to the many loopholes raised not only by this newspaper's political reporter but also by Indian public opinion and other observers. This only proves that the person who wrote this statement completely dares not face the facts and cannot deny the facts.

The Indian foreign official Menon, who has been with the rebel elements who abducted the Dalai Lama in the past few days and, according to Indian newspapers, participated in the "discussion" of the statement on the 18th, also issued a statement on the 22nd, hastily trying to clear himself, insisting that the statement on the 18th was "written by the Dalai Lama" and "translated by the Tibetans themselves. Others cannot be held responsible for this statement." But this Indian official's statement was obviously too hasty, so that he immediately revealed his deceit. According to the statement issued in the Dalai Lama's name on the same day, the statement issued in Tezpur on the 18th was "issued under the Dalai Lama's authorization," not "written by the Dalai Lama." How can the Dalai Lama authorize the Dalai Lama to write and issue statements? Neither of them explained this ridiculous contradiction.

It is noted that, despite wanting to change the impression that the Dalai Lama was abducted, the statement on the 22nd was still not issued by the Dalai Lama himself, but by the "reactionary elements" who abducted him, as mentioned in the three letters written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan. The Dalai Lama did not even appear when the statement was issued.

What is different about this statement from the last statement is that its drafters have learned from the lessons of the loopholes revealed in the last statement and have changed all the third-person pronouns to first-person pronouns. The full text of the statement issued in the name of the Dalai Lama on the 22nd is as follows:

"I issued a statement in Tezpur on April 18th. At that time, I did not want to issue another statement. But I saw a report from Xinhua News Agency suggesting that I was not responsible for the earlier statement. I want to make it clear that the earlier statement was issued under my authorization, it expressed my views, and I stand by this statement. I am issuing this brief statement to correct the erroneous impression created by the Xinhua News Agency report, and I do not intend to say anything more at this time."

    达赖喇嘛怎么能够授权达赖喇嘛写声明和发表声明？
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的来由何等滑稽
    叛乱分子又以达赖名义发表声明进行辩解，结果是欲盖弥彰
    印度外交官员梅农赶忙为自己洗刷，但是马上又露出了马脚
    新华社23日讯　据印度报业托辣斯穆索里消息，劫持达赖喇嘛到印度去的西藏叛乱分子22日在穆索里宣读了以达赖喇嘛名义发表的一个简短声明。这个声明企图否认4月18日在提斯浦尔由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”是别人强加于达赖喇嘛的。但是，这种辩解只是欲盖弥彰。
    这篇声明是针对4月20日本社政治记者评所谓达赖喇嘛的声明而发的。在这篇评论中，记者指出所谓达赖喇嘛的声明有许多明显的漏洞，人们有理由怀疑这个声明不是达赖喇嘛本人的声明，而是别人强加于达赖喇嘛的。22日又以达赖喇嘛名义发表的声明，对于不仅本社政治记者而且还有印度的公众舆论和其他观察家提出的许多漏洞，没有作任何解答。这只能证明写这个声明的人完全不敢面对事实，也无法否认事实。
    在过去这些天中一直同劫持达赖喇嘛的叛乱分子在一起，并且据印度报刊披露曾参加了18日的声明的“讨论”的印度外交官员梅农，在22日也发表谈话，赶忙为自己洗刷，硬说18日的声明是“达赖喇嘛写的”，是“西藏人自己翻译的。其他人不能对这个声明负责”。但是这个印度官员的谈话显然太匆忙了，以至马上又露了马脚。据当天用达赖喇嘛名义发表的声明说，18日在提斯浦尔发表的声明是在达赖喇嘛“授权下发表的”，而不是“达赖喇嘛写的”。达赖喇嘛怎么能够授权达赖喇嘛写声明和发表声明，这个滑稽的矛盾他们两方面都没有加以解释。
    人们注意到，尽管想要改变达赖喇嘛是受人劫持的印象，22日的声明仍然不是由达赖喇嘛本人亲自发表的，而是由达赖喇嘛在写给谭冠三将军的三封信中所说的劫持了他的“反动分子”发表的。在发表这个声明的时候，达赖喇嘛甚至没有露面。
    这个声明同上次声明不同的，是它的起草人接受了上次声明中露了马脚的教训，把所有第三人称都换成了第一人称。二十二日以达赖喇嘛名义发表的声明全文如下：
    “4月18日我在提斯浦尔发表了一篇声明。当时我并不想接着再发表一篇声明。但是我看到新华社的报道暗示，早些时候发表的这篇声明不由我负责。我希望说清楚，早些时候的这篇声明是在我的授权下发表的，它表示了我的看法，我坚持这篇声明。我发表这项简短的声明是为了纠正新华社的报道所造成的错误印象，我在目前不打算再说甚么。”
