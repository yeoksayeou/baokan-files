    To Practice, One Must Have Enthusiasm
    Why can we communists possess a spirit of fearlessness and heroic spirit? It is because we have recognized the objective laws of social development and are convinced that a communist society will surely be realized. More than a hundred years ago, when the capitalist system was considered sacred and inviolable, Marx and Engels announced to the world that capitalism would inevitably be eliminated and communism would inevitably triumph. Our great Chairman Mao, nearly thirty years ago, when the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled all of China and the revolutionary forces were very small, wisely pointed out that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," and firmly led the people of the whole country to carry the revolution through to the end, possessing unlimited confidence in the victory of the revolutionary cause. Before liberation, our vast military and civilian population dared to use millet plus rifles to eliminate the then still very powerful Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the Korean War, our Chinese People's Volunteers dared to resist and defeat the aggression of the American imperialism with its modernized equipment, despite our inferior equipment. Obviously, all of the above fully embodies a greatest revolutionary enthusiasm. However, this does not come out of thin air, but is due to a complete grasp of the objective laws of social development, a correct understanding of the situation of class struggle at that time, a scientific analysis and judgment of things, and a great scientific foresight. Therefore, we emphasize revolutionary enthusiasm, which cannot be separated from objective laws, and must be based on scientific analysis of the actual situation, leading to ideas and opinions, and formulating plans, guidelines, policies, strategies, and tactics, and then do accordingly, so that we can better exert our soaring enthusiasm and ensure that our actions achieve the desired results. However, we must also understand that true scientific analysis can never be separated from soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. We know that to understand and grasp objective laws, we need to go through the practical activities of the masses, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Discover truth through practice, and verify truth through practice." (On Practice) Only through the practice of the masses, that is, hard work, practical work, and clever work, can we obtain perceptual knowledge of things, understand the general situation, and with the continuation of practice and people's high degree of generalization and research, can we gradually grasp the essence of things, the totality of things, and the internal connections of things, and finally make scientific judgments and conclusions about things. Whether this analysis and judgment completely conforms to the actual situation needs to be further tested and verified in the process of practice by the masses. However, any successful practice, whether it is production activities, revolutionary struggles, or scientific research, the primary condition is to have enthusiasm, without which there will be no effective practice.
    Revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific analysis are completely dialectical unity, and revolutionary enthusiasm plays a leading role. Because, in the final analysis, only when people muster their enthusiasm and do their best to do things can they see the internal connections of things and recognize objective laws; and the purpose of scientific analysis is to make revolutionary enthusiasm play a greater and higher role in promoting the development of the revolutionary cause.

    要实践就要有干劲
    为什么我们共产主义者能具有大无畏的精神与英雄的气概呢？就是由于认识了社会发展的客观规律，确信共产主义社会一定能够实现。马克思与恩格斯，在一百多年以前，在资本主义制度被认为神圣不可侵犯的时候，就向全世界宣布，资本主义必然要消灭，共产主义必然要胜利；我们伟大的毛主席，还在将近三十年前，在国民党反动派统治全中国，革命力量很小的时候，就英明地指出：“星星之火，可以燎原”，坚定地领导全国人民将革命进行到底，对于革命事业具有无限的胜利的信心；我国广大军民，在解放前，用小米加步枪，敢于去消灭当时还很强大的日本帝国主义与国民党反动派；我国人民志愿军，在朝鲜战争中，用劣势的装备，敢于抵抗并且打败现代化装备的美帝国主义的侵略。显然，上述这些都充分体现出了一种最伟大的革命干劲。但是，这不是凭空而来的，而是由于完全掌握了社会发展的客观规律，正确认识了当时阶级斗争的形势，对于事物作了科学的分析与判断，具有伟大的科学预见。因此，我们强调革命干劲，不能离开客观规律，必须根据实际情况进行科学分析，引出思想、意见，订出计划、方针、政策、战略、战术，依此去做，才能更好的发挥冲天干劲，才能保证我们的行动获得预期的效果。但是，又要懂得，真正的科学分析，又决不能离开冲天的革命干劲。我们知道，要认识与掌握客观规律，就需要通过人民群众的实践活动，正如毛主席所指出的：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理”。（实践论）只有通过人民群众的实践，亦即苦干、实干和巧干，才能获得对事物的感性认识，了解一般的情况，随着实践的继续和人们的高度概括与研究，才能逐步抓住事物的本质、事物的全体、事物的内部联系，最后作出对事物的科学判断和结论。这种分析与判断，是否完全符合于实际情况，又需要在人民群众实践的过程中，去进一步检验与证实。但是，任何成功的实践，不管生产活动也好，革命斗争也好，科学研究也好，首要条件是要有干劲，没有干劲就不会有任何有成效的实践。
    革命干劲与科学分析完全是辩证的统一，而且革命干劲又是起主导作用的。因为归根结底，只有人们鼓足干劲，竭尽全力去做，才能洞察事物内部联系，认识到客观规律；而科学分析的目的，又是为了使革命干劲发挥得更大、更高，以推动革命事业的发展。
