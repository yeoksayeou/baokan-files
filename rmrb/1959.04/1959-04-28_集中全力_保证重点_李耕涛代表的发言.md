Fellow Delegates:
I fully support Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am determined to implement them.

Tianjin is one of China's existing industrial bases. In 1958, like everywhere else in the country, it achieved unprecedented victories. The city's total industrial output value (excluding counties under the city's jurisdiction) increased by 70.4 percent compared to 1957, and the completed basic construction investment increased by 460 percent compared to 1957. A total of 328 new and expanded industrial projects were undertaken. This great victory has created an extremely favorable situation for continued Great Leap Forward. The people of the city are striving with soaring enthusiasm to achieve a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. We deeply realize that to ensure the completion of the national plan, we must resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and vigorously promote mass movements.

In order to implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," we have conducted multiple studies and adjustments to this year's production and basic construction plans based on the tasks assigned by the Central Government and the province. We have initially determined that the city's total industrial output value will increase by about 55 percent compared to last year. In making arrangements, we adhered to the principle of local subordination to the overall situation, and guaranteeing the key points first. We paid special attention to: correctly handling the relationship between the national plan and local plans, placing the national plan first, and developing the city's industrial production by guaranteeing the national plan; correctly handling the relationship between key products and general products, distinguishing between primary and secondary, important and unimportant, urgent and less urgent, concentrating efforts to guarantee key products, especially the four major indicators and "six guarantees" products, and driving the production of general products by guaranteeing the production of key products; correctly handling the relationship between advanced, precision, large-scale, cutting-edge products and "mass-produced" products, developing the production of advanced, precision, large-scale, cutting-edge products on the premise of ensuring the urgent needs of national construction and the current people's lives; correctly handling the relationship between production and basic construction, making basic construction subordinate to production, and general basic construction projects subordinate to key basic construction projects, especially projects that are critical to completing this year's production plan; correctly handling the relationship between the city's industrial production and the industrial and agricultural production of fraternal regions, actively supporting fraternal regions, strengthening cooperation, and promoting each other under the common goal of ensuring the completion of the national plan.

In order to implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," we organized cadres throughout the city to study repeatedly, strengthen the overall perspective, and criticize the thinking of only caring about the small picture and not the big picture. And according to the instructions of the Central Government, we specifically stipulated that: in production, no one should change the tasks assigned by the state without authorization, nor should they "add layers" of quotas; in basic construction, it is imperative to fully guarantee the key points, and no unit may independently "start" projects not included in the plan; in terms of raw materials, we adhere to unified distribution and dedicated materials for dedicated purposes. In these aspects, we must ensure the key points, and those that need to "give way" must consciously "give way." We must use manpower, materials, and financial resources in the most urgent and effective places. In order to strengthen the centralized leadership of the city, production command centers at all levels have also been established and improved. Leading cadres are assigned according to battle lines and key products, arranging progress specifically according to the plan, and deeply and practically grasping measures, supervising and inspecting monthly, ten-day periods, and daily to ensure the timely completion of the plan.

While implementing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," it is also necessary to boldly mobilize the masses, mobilize all positive factors, and closely combine strengthening centralized and unified leadership with vigorously promoting mass movements.

This year's mass movement should take a step forward on the basis of last year, combining hard work, practical work, and clever work, and fully leverage the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. To this end, at the beginning of the year, we first mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and repeatedly discussed this year's national plan. Starting in mid-February, the city launched a red banner competition movement centered on technological revolution and technological innovation. This movement aims to improve labor productivity and do everything possible to ensure the completion of the national plan; take technical innovation, overcome the difficulties of raw material shortages, and improve labor organization as the basic content; take "seven comparisons" of comparing output, quality, variety, cost, labor productivity, collaboration, and safety as the competition conditions; and take competitions in the same industry, the same product, the same type of work, and the same job as the main way to organize competitions.

This movement developed rapidly, became increasingly high, and began to receive preliminary results. Because the broad masses were mobilized to tap potential in every possible way, rapid progress has been made in opening up resources, increasing raw material production, reducing raw material consumption, improving finished product yield, vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization, substitution and waste recycling, and cleaning up warehouses, solving many raw material shortage problems. Many units in our city that lacked raw materials were able to complete and over fulfill production plans, which is inseparable from the adoption of these practices. Mobilizing the broad masses to carry out technological revolution and technological innovation has given technical improvement and enhancement a broad mass base. Therefore, progress has also been made rapidly in improving tools and equipment, improving processes and operations, improving product design and formulas, and trial-producing new products. For example, the electromechanical industry has improved mechanical design under the principle of ensuring product quality and precision, which not only makes products lighter, but also is expected to save about one-tenth of steel materials throughout the year. For example, factories such as the Hoisting and Transportation Equipment Factory have continuously refreshed production records since the start of the movement, and production experts who have exceeded quotas by more than doubled have emerged in batches. With the continuous deepening of technological revolution and technological innovation, and the rapid improvement of production efficiency, it is not only conditional but also necessary to improve labor organization accordingly. We are conducting research according to the instructions of the Central Government and the province, and are preparing to streamline a batch of labor forces from the industrial front, which can not only greatly improve labor productivity, but also transfer forces to support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and other aspects.

After this stage of carrying out the red flag competition centered on technological revolution and technological innovation, we have more deeply realized that the experiences created in 1958, such as large-scale airing of views, debates, and posting of big-character posters, explaining tasks to the masses, cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management, and the three-way combination of leading cadres, workers, and technicians, must continue to be adhered to and further developed in practice. This year, in "revealing the bottom line" to the masses, we emphasized deep and thorough explanations, especially boldly clarifying difficulties and problems, and we must also let the masses air their views, debate, and fully express their opinions. Facts have proved that only in this way can the leadership and the masses be of one mind and have unified will, fully leverage the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and make the thinking of leading cadres more in line with the feelings of the masses and the actual situation. In the "three-way combination," we promoted the experience of the "three-way combination technical research group" of Tianjin Power Machine Factory and Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Factory, that is, establishing technical research groups combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians level by level in factories, workshops, work sections, and production teams to jointly study, improve, and innovate technology. In this way, not only the combination of leadership and the masses, politics and technology, technical theory and production practice, and foreign methods and local methods can be better organized, powerfully promoting technological revolution and technological innovation, but also opening up a path for workers to participate in technical management and scientific and technological research.

After implementing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and vigorously carrying out the red flag competition centered on technological revolution and technological innovation, Tianjin's industrial output value plan for the first quarter was overfulfilled, increasing by 72.55 percent compared to the same period last year. However, it is worth noting that the output plan and quality plan for some products have not been completed well enough.

This conference has given us great encouragement. We must earnestly implement the resolutions of the conference, redouble our efforts, especially in the decisive second quarter, strive to achieve a greater leap forward, and ensure the completion and strive to over fulfill the annual production tasks assigned to us by the state.

When the people of the whole country are united in a large family and are leaping forward along the socialist road, the Tibetan reactionaries dared to disregard the interests of the people of the whole country and the interests of their own people. Under the instigation of British imperialism and Indian expansionists, they tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement, organized armed rebellion, abducted the Dalai Lama, undermined national unity, and split the unity of the motherland. This treasonous crime has aroused unanimous condemnation and great indignation from the people of the whole country.

It must also be pointed out that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The Tibetan issue is China's internal affair, and no external aggressor is allowed to interfere. However, Indian diplomatic officials and Indian expansionists attempted to use the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" to confuse right and wrong and reverse black and white, and condoned reactionaries to attack the Chinese government, insult our head of state, and undermine Sino-Indian friendly relations, which was resolutely opposed by China's 600 million people. We warn you: keep your heads cool! Imperialists and expansionists, if you want to interfere in China's internal affairs, you will only suffer the same shameful defeat as the Tibetan rebels! Victory must belong to the Chinese people! Let the expansionists howl! Let the imperialists tremble!

    集中全力　保证重点
    李耕涛代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并决心贯彻执行。
    天津市是我国现有工业基地之一，在一九五八年，和全国各地一样，取得了空前的胜利。全市工业总产值（不包括市属各县）比一九五七年增长百分之七十点四，完成的基本建设投资额比一九五七年增长百分之四百六十，新建扩建的工业项目共计三百二十八个。这个伟大的胜利，给继续大跃进创造了极为有利的形势，全市人民正以冲天的干劲，为实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。我们深刻地体会到，要保证完成国家计划，必须坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，大搞群众运动。
    为了贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，我们根据中央和省下达的任务，对今年的生产和基本建设计划，进行了多次地研究和调整，初步确定全市工业总产值比去年增长百分之五十五左右。在进行安排时，我们坚持了局部服从整体、首先保证重点的原则，特别注意了：正确处理国家计划和地方计划的关系，把国家计划放在第一位，通过保证国家计划来发展本市的工业生产；正确处理重点产品和一般产品的关系，分清主次、轻重、先后、缓急，集中力量保证重点、首先是四大指标和“六保”产品，通过保证重点产品的生产带动一般产品的生产；正确处理高级、精密、大型、尖端产品和“大路货”产品的关系，在保证国家建设和当前人民生活的急需的前提下，发展高级、精密、大型、尖端产品的生产；正确处理生产和基本建设的关系，使基本建设服从生产，一般基本建设项目服从重点基本建设项目、特别是对于完成今年生产计划关系重大的项目；正确处理本市工业生产和兄弟地区工农业生产的关系，在保证完成国家计划的共同目标下，积极支援兄弟地区，加强协作，互相促进。
    为了贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，我们组织全市干部反复进行了学习，加强整体观点，批判了只顾小局不顾大局的思想；并且根据中央的指示，具体规定了：在生产上，不得擅自改变国家下达的任务，也不要层层“加码”；在基本建设上，必须全力保证重点，未列入计划的项目任何单位不得自行“上马”；在原材料上，坚持统一分配，专料专用；在这些方面，都必须确保重点，需要“让路”的要自觉地“让路”，一定要把人力、物力和财力，使用在需要最迫切、收效最大最快的地方。为了加强全市的集中领导，还建立和健全了各级生产指挥部，领导干部按战线、按重点产品进行分工，根据计划具体安排进度，深入地切实地抓措施，按月、按旬、按日督促检查，保证按期完成计划。
    在贯彻全国一盘棋的方针的同时，还必需放手发动群众，调动一切积极因素，把加强集中统一领导与大搞群众运动密切结合起来。
    今年的群众运动，要在去年的基础上提高一步，使苦干、实干和巧干相结合，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性。为此，我们在年初，首先发动群众总结了一九五八年大跃进的经验，反复讨论了今年的国家计划，从二月中旬开始，全市开展了以技术革命和技术革新为中心的红旗竞赛运动。这个运动，以提高劳动生产率，千方百计地保证完成国家计划为目的；以革新技术、克服原材料缺乏的困难、改善劳动组织为基本内容；以比产量、比质量、比品种、比成本、比劳动生产率、比协作、比安全的“七比”为竞赛条件；以同行业、同产品、同工种、同工作的竞赛为组织竞赛的主要方式。
    这个运动，发展迅速，日趋高涨，并且开始收到初步效果。由于把广大群众发动起来，千方百计地挖掘潜力，因此，在开辟资源、增加原材料生产、降低原材料消耗、提高成品收获率、大搞原材料的综合利用、代用和废品回收、清理仓库等方面，取得了很快的进展，解决了不少原材料缺乏的问题。我市许多原材料缺乏的单位得以完成和超额完成生产计划，都是和采用这些作法分不开的。把广大群众发动起来开展技术革命和技术革新，使技术的改进和提高具有了广泛的群众基础，因此，在改进工具和设备、改进工艺和操作、改进产品设计和配方、试制新产品等方面，也很快取得了进展。如机电行业在保证产品质量和精密度的原则下，改进机械设计，不仅使产品轻便，而且预计全年可以节省十分之一左右的钢材；又如起重运输设备厂等工厂，开展运动以来，生产纪录不断刷新，突破定额一倍以上的生产能手成批地涌现。随着技术革命和技术革新的不断深入，生产效率的迅速提高，不仅有条件而且也必需相应地改善劳动组织。我们正在根据中央和省的指示进行研究，准备从工业战线上精简一批劳动力，这样不仅可以大大提高劳动生产率，而且可以调出力量支援农业及其他方面的大跃进。
    经过这一阶段开展以技术革命和技术革新为中心的红旗竞赛，我们更加体会到，一九五八年所创造的大鸣大放大辩论，向群众交代任务、干部参加劳动、工人参加管理、领导干部、工人群众和技术人员三结合等经验，必须继续坚持运用并在实践中进一步发展，今年在向群众“交底”上，我们强调了交深交透，特别是要大胆地讲清困难和问题，而且还必须放手让群众鸣放辩论，把心里的意见充分发表出来。事实证明，只有这样才能使领导和群众心心相通、意志统一，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，也使领导干部的思想更符合群众的心情和实际情况。在“三结合”上，我们推广了天津动力机厂和天津织染厂的“三结合技术研究组”的经验，也就是在厂、车间、工段、生产小组逐级建立领导干部、工人和技术人员相结合的技术研究组，共同钻研改进和革新技术。这样，不仅使领导与群众、政治与技术、技术理论与生产实践、洋办法与土办法的结合更好地组织起来，有力地推动技术革命和技术革新，而且为工人参加技术管理和科学技术研究开辟了道路。
    经过贯彻执行全国一盘棋的方针，大搞以技术革命和技术革新为中心的红旗竞赛，天津市第一季度的工业总产值计划超额完成了，比去年同期增长了百分之七十二点五五。但是，值得注意的是，还有一些产品的产量计划和质量计划完成的不够好。
    这次大会给了我们巨大的鼓舞，我们一定要认真执行大会的决议，更加鼓足干劲，特别是首先在具有决定意义的第二季度里，争取实现更大的跃进，保证完成并且力争超额完成国家交付给我们的全年生产任务。
    全国人民团结在大家庭里，正在沿着社会主义道路飞跃前进的时候。西藏反动集团，竟敢不顾全国人民的利益和本族人民的利益，在英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的指使下，撕毁了十七条协定、组织武装叛乱、劫走达赖喇嘛、破坏民族团结、分裂祖国的统一。这种叛国罪行，引起全国人民一致的声讨和极大的愤慨。
    还必须指出：西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分。西藏问题是中国人民的内政，决不允许任何外来侵略者干涉。但是，印度外交官员和印度扩张主义分子企图用所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”偷天换日，颠倒黑白，并纵容反动分子攻击中国政府，侮辱我国元首，破坏中印友好关系，遭到我国六亿人民的坚决反对。警告你们：脑袋还是放冷静一点吧！帝国主义和扩张主义分子，要想干涉中国内政，只有遭到像西藏叛乱分子一样可耻的失败！胜利一定属于中国人民！让扩张主义者嚎叫吧！让帝国主义者发抖吧！
