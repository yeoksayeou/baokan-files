    Modernized Industrial Enterprises Must Continue to Launch Mass Movements

    What was the most important experience of the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction in 1958? It was to launch mass movements on a large scale under the unified leadership of the Party. What is the most reliable guarantee for China to continue the Great Leap Forward in 1959? It is still to launch mass movements on a large scale under the unified leadership of the Party. This is true on the agricultural front, and it is also true on the industrial front; it is true for small, indigenous production enterprises, and it is also true for modernized industrial enterprises.

    History is created by the people, and the people are the masters of history. This is one of the basic viewpoints of historical materialism. When this viewpoint is applied to revolutionary work, it becomes the mass line that our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have consistently advocated and implemented. This is the working line that our Party must implement in all its work—to fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of the people under centralized and unified leadership. The power of the people under the strong leadership of the Party is an invincible force. The masses put it well: "Of all the factors, the Party's leadership is the most important; of all the plans, the mass line is the best." No matter what work we do, and no matter when, if we want to achieve victory, we must rely on the leadership of the Party, conscientiously implement the mass line, and launch mass movements on a large scale. Our mass movement is a mass movement under centralized and unified leadership, a mass movement in which leading cadres and the broad masses are closely combined. Only under the strong political and organizational leadership of the Party can the political awareness and organization of the masses be rapidly improved, and the great power and infinite wisdom of the masses be fully utilized. In modernized industrial enterprises, only by organizing the initiative and creativity of the broad masses of workers and forming a vigorous and down-to-earth mass movement can the Great Leap Forward in the production of modernized industrial enterprises be realized. Why was the production of many modernized industrial enterprises able to grow at a high speed of tens of percent, one time, several times, or even more than ten times last year? The secret lies in implementing the Party's mass line and launching a vigorous mass production movement under centralized leadership. Modernized industrial enterprises are the main force on China's industrial front, and they bear the most important task in completing the national plan. Whether the mass production movement in modernized industrial enterprises is carried out well or not has a decisive impact on the realization of this year's Great Leap Forward. All modernized industrial enterprises must realize that they bear a pivotal task and must launch mass production movements more widely and deeply.

    Last year's experience proves that in order to carry out large-scale mass production movements in industrial enterprises, it is necessary to closely integrate them with the characteristics of modernized industrial enterprises. One of the characteristics of modernized industrial enterprises is that their production adopts relatively complex technical equipment. The leap forward in the production of modernized industrial enterprises is mainly realized through people improving technology and improving equipment, tools, processes, and product design. The characteristic of modernized industrial enterprises having more complex technical equipment does not exclude launching mass production movements in modernized industrial enterprises, but requires us to guide mass production movements to the road of technical revolution and technical innovation in light of this characteristic. Last year, many modernized industrial enterprises launched mass production movements on a large scale and carried out technical revolution and technical innovation on a large scale, which made production develop rapidly. In Shanghai alone, there were more than 400,000 technical innovation proposals, of which more than 200,000 have been implemented, which played a decisive role in the 50.3% increase in Shanghai's total industrial output value last year. Without such a mass production movement of technical revolution and technical innovation on a large scale, there could not have been such a big leap forward. It can be seen that the characteristic of relatively complex technology in modernized industrial enterprises does not hinder launching mass movements in modernized industrial enterprises; moreover, only by using the method of launching mass production movements on a large scale to carry out technical revolution and technical innovation can we promote technical progress in industry and realize the production leap forward of modernized industrial enterprises.

    The content of technical revolution and technical innovation is extremely broad. To sum up, there are: the revolution and innovation of processes, the revolution and innovation of tools and equipment, the revolution and innovation of product design, the use of new raw materials, and the research, experimentation, and mastery of cutting-edge technologies, and so on. We must warmly support all the initiatives of the broad masses in technical revolution and technical innovation. The reform of one process seems to have little value; but the reform of thousands of processes can change the entire production appearance of the enterprise. Moreover, the reform of one process may develop into the revolution of the entire process; the reform of a certain part of the product design, "cutting off the appendix," is also very likely to develop into a complete transformation of the entire product design. The law of development from quantitative change to qualitative change, from low-level to high-level, in technical revolution and technical innovation requires us to attach great importance to any slight creation. However, this does not mean that technical revolution and technical innovation can have no focus, and that whatever the masses create can be promoted. Without a focus, without planning the direction of technical revolution and technical innovation, it is impossible to organize the initiative and creativity of the masses. The formulation of technical revolution and technical innovation plans must not only have far-reaching goals, but also proceed from reality, and it is especially important to first serve the completion of the 1959 production plan, and point the spearhead of technical revolution and technical innovation at the current production key and weak links.

    Another characteristic of modernized industrial enterprises is that the division of labor is fine and close cooperation is required between each other. The relationship between upper and lower processes, between day and night shifts, and between this workshop and that workshop is very close, requiring centralized and unified leadership and coordinated action. This characteristic of modernized industrial enterprises does not exclude launching mass production movements in enterprises, but requires us to strengthen centralized leadership and strengthen enterprise management while launching mass movements in modernized industrial enterprises in light of this characteristic, and establish a set of scientific management systems that are both suitable for the requirements of modernized industrial enterprises and facilitate the mobilization of the initiative and creativity of the masses. The scientific management system is not the opposite of the mass production movement, it not only does not hinder the development of the mass production movement, but is an indispensable tool for leading and organizing the mass production movement. In the past period, the rules and regulations of some enterprises had a situation where more were broken than established. At present, it is very necessary to launch the masses to conduct a comprehensive review of the rules and regulations of the enterprise. Through this review, a set of scientific management systems should be established, first of all the responsibility system, safety regulations, and economic accounting system, so that the mass production movement of modernized industrial enterprises can be better developed.

    Continuously improving leadership methods is an important link in deepening the mass movement. In last year's Great Leap Forward, we have summed up leadership methods for mass movements such as "one explanation," "four bigs," "two participations," and "three combinations." "One explanation" is to explain the bottom line, that is, to tell the masses the production tasks, favorable conditions, and objective difficulties in an all-round way, and mobilize the masses to discuss and find solutions. "Four bigs" is to organize the masses to speak out freely, air views fully, hold great debates, and put up big-character posters when solving major problems, so that everyone can put forward their own views and ideas, and after debate, achieve unified understanding and unified action. "Two participations" means that cadres participate in labor and workers participate in management; this is to closely link the relationship between leaders and those being led, so that cadres can more comprehensively understand the objective laws of production through the practice of production, and timely discover and solve problems in production, and also enable the workers to participate in the management of the enterprise, strengthen their sense of responsibility, and use their rich experience in production practice to improve the management of the enterprise. "Three combinations" means that leading cadres, workers, and technicians combine to learn from each other's strengths and solve problems together. These leadership methods of the mass line have powerfully promoted last year's Great Leap Forward and must be adhered to this year and further developed and improved in practice.

    To continue to launch mass production movements in modern industrial enterprises, we must strengthen the Party's leadership. The enterprise Party committee must implement unified leadership over the overall work of the enterprise, but it must also pay attention to the role of administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in terms of policies and major issues, and must not take on all the affairs that should be the responsibility of these organizations and get caught in the circle of transactionalism. Therefore, the leadership system of the enterprise, in terms of the Party, is to implement a system that combines collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility; in terms of administrative management, it is to implement the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee and the workers' representative assembly system under the leadership of the Party committee. The factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee is the core of various responsibility systems in the enterprise, and this system must be respected, and a system of division of labor and responsibility at all levels must be established in production management with this system as the core. The factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee should be combined with the workers' representative assembly system under the leadership of the Party committee, so that the centralized and unified command in enterprise management is established on the basis of broad democracy. We believe that as long as we strengthen the Party's leadership, correctly implement the above-mentioned enterprise leadership system, and carry out large-scale mass movements according to the characteristics of modern industrial enterprises, modern industrial enterprises will surely be able to give full play to their backbone role in realizing the Great Leap Forward of the entire industrial front.

### 现代化工业企业要继续大搞群众运动

    现代化工业企业要继续大搞群众运动
    1958年我国社会主义建设大跃进的最重要的经验是什么？是在党的统一领导下大搞群众运动。1959年我国继续大跃进的最可靠的保证是什么？还是在党的统一领导下大搞群众运动。这在农业战线上是如此，在工业战线上也是如此；在小型的土法生产的企业是如此，在现代化工业企业也是如此。
    历史是人民群众创造的，人民群众是历史的主人。这是历史唯物主义的基本观点之一。这个观点运用在革命工作方面，就是我们党和毛泽东同志一贯提倡和贯彻实行的群众路线。这是我们党在一切工作中都要贯彻实行的在集中统一的领导下充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性的工作路线。在党的坚强领导下的人民群众的力量，是攻无不克、战无不胜的力量。群众说得好：“千条万条，党的领导是第一条；千计万计，群众路线是第一计。”我们不论做什么工作，不论在什么时候，要想取得胜利，就必须依靠党的领导，认真实行群众路线，大搞群众运动。我们的群众运动是集中统一领导下的群众运动，是领导骨干和广大群众密切结合的群众运动。只有在党的强有力的政治领导和组织领导下，才能迅速提高群众的政治觉悟和组织性，才能充分地发挥群众的巨大的力量和无穷的智慧。在现代化工业企业里，也只有把广大职工群众的积极性和创造性组织起来，形成轰轰烈烈切切实实的群众运动，才能实现现代化工业企业的生产大跃进。为什么去年许多现代化工业企业的生产能够以百分之几十、一倍、几倍、以至十几倍的高速度增长呢？其秘诀也就在于贯彻了党的群众路线，掀起了轰轰烈烈的在集中领导下的群众生产运动。现代化工业企业是我国工业战线的主力，它在完成国家计划中担负着最重要的任务。现代化工业企业的群众生产运动搞得好不好，对于实现今年大跃进有着决定性的影响。一切现代化工业企业都必须认识到自己担负着举足轻重的任务，更广泛、更深入地大搞群众生产运动。
    去年的经验证明，在工业企业中开展大规模的群众生产运动，一定要紧密结合现代化工业企业的特点。现代化工业企业的特点之一，是它的生产采用比较复杂的技术装备。现代化工业企业生产上的跃进，主要是通过人们提高技术和改进设备、工具、工艺、产品设计等方面来实现的。现代化工业企业具有较复杂的技术装备的这个特点，并不排斥在现代化工业企业中大搞群众生产运动，而且要求我们针对这个特点，把群众生产运动引导到技术革命和技术革新的道路上来。去年，许多现代化工业企业大搞群众生产运动，大搞技术革命和技术革新，使生产突飞猛进地发展。仅上海一地的技术革新建议就有四十多万条，其中已经实现的有二十多万条，这对于去年上海工业总产值增长50.3％起了决定性的影响。没有这样一个大搞技术革命和技术革新的群众生产运动，就不可能有这样大的跃进。可见，现代化工业企业技术比较复杂的特点，并不妨碍在现代化工业企业中大搞群众运动；而且，只有用大搞群众生产运动的办法来开展技术革命和技术革新，才能推动工业中的技术进步，实现现代化工业企业的生产跃进。
    技术革命和技术革新的内容极其广泛。概括起来有：工艺的革命和革新、工具和设备的革命和革新、产品设计的革命和革新、利用新的原材料以及研究、试验和掌握尖端技术等等。我们对于广大群众一切技术革命和技术革新的倡举，都要热烈地加以支持。一道工序的改革，看来价值不大；但千百道工序的改革，却能使整个企业的生产面貌为之改观。况且，一道工序的改革，可能发展为整个工艺过程的革命；改革产品设计的某一部分，“割盲肠”，也很有可能发展为整个产品设计脱胎换骨的改造。技术革命和技术革新这种由量变到质变、由低级到高级的发展规律，要求我们十分重视任何些微细小的创造。但是，这又不等于说，技术革命和技术革新就可以没有重点，群众创造什么就推广什么。没有重点，不规划技术革命和技术革新的方向，就不能把群众的积极性和创造性组织起来。制订技术革命和技术革新的规划，既要有远大的目标，又要从实际出发，特别重要的是首先要为完成1959年的生产计划服务，把技术革命和技术革新的矛头指向当前的生产关键和薄弱环节。
    现代化工业企业的另一个特点是，分工精细而相互之间又需要严密的协作。上下工序之间，日夜三班之间，这个车间和那个车间之间的关系非常密切，需要集中统一的领导和协调一致的动作。现代化工业企业的这个特点，也不排斥在企业中大搞群众生产运动，而是要求我们针对这个特点，在现代化工业企业中大搞群众运动的同时加强集中领导，加强企业管理，建立一套既适合现代化工业企业的要求，又便于发挥群众积极性和创造性的科学管理制度。科学的管理制度并不是群众生产运动的对立面，它不但不妨碍群众生产运动的发展，而且是领导和组织群众生产运动必不可少的工具。过去一个时期，某些企业的规章制度有破得多立得少的情况，目前很有必要发动群众对企业的规章制度进行一次全面的审查，通过这次审查，建立一套科学的管理制度，首先是责任制、保安规程和经济核算制，使现代化工业企业的群众生产运动得到更好的发展。
    不断地改善领导方法，是深入开展群众运动的一个重要环节。在去年的大跃进中，我们已经总结出“一交”、“四大”、“两参”、“三结合”等领导群众运动的方法。“一交”是交底，就是把生产任务、有利条件和客观困难全盘告诉群众，发动群众讨论，大家想办法。“四大”就是在解决重大问题的时候，组织群众大鸣、大放、大辩论、贴大字报，每个人把自己的看法和想法摆出来，经过辩论，达到统一认识、统一行动的目的。“两参”就是干部参加劳动，工人参加管理；这一方面是为了密切领导和被领导的关系，使干部通过生产的实践，更加全面地认识生产的客观规律，及时地发现和解决生产中的问题，同时也使工人群众能够参加企业的管理，加强他们的责任心，运用他们在生产实践中的丰富的经验，改进企业的管理。“三结合”就是领导干部、工人群众和技术人员结合起来，取长补短，共同解决问题。这些群众路线的领导方法，曾经有力地推动了去年的大跃进，今年必须坚持下来，在实践中进一步发展和提高。
    在现代工业企业中继续大搞群众生产运动，必须加强党的领导。企业党委必须对企业的全面工作实行统一领导，但是，又必须在政策方针和重大问题上注意发挥行政、工会、共青团等组织的作用，不能把应当归这些组织负责进行的事务都揽在身上，陷入事务主义的圈子。因此，企业的领导制度，在党内说来，就是要实行集体领导和分工负责相结合的制度；在行政管理上，就是要实行党委领导下的厂长负责制和党委领导下的职工代表大会制。党委领导下的厂长负责制，是企业中各种责任制的核心，必须尊重这个制度，以这个制度为核心，在生产管理上建立各级分工负责制。党委领导下的厂长负责制应当和党委领导下的职工代表大会制结合起来，使企业管理上的集中统一指挥建立在广泛民主的基础上。我们相信，只要加强党的领导，正确地贯彻执行上述企业领导制度，根据现代化工业企业的特点开展大规模的群众运动，现代化工业企业一定能在实现整个工业战线的大跃进中充分发挥它的骨干作用。
