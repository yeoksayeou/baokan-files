Xinhua News Agency, 20th - It is reported that the Dalai Lama issued a statement in Tezpur on April 18th, en route to his residence in Mussoorie in northern India. The English version of this statement was distributed to the press by Indian Foreign Ministry officials. The translation of the English text of this statement, broadcast by the Indian Press Bureau, is as follows:

Tibetans and Chinese Han people are different, and this has always been recognized. Tibetans have always had a strong desire for independence. This has been demonstrated many times throughout history. At times, the Chinese government imposed its suzerainty on Tibet, and at other times, Tibet functioned as an independent country. In any case, at all times, even when China imposed its suzerainty on Tibet, Tibet was autonomous in the management of its internal affairs.

In 1951, under pressure from the Chinese government, the Seventeen-Point Agreement was reached between China and Tibet. In that agreement, Chinese suzerainty was accepted because Tibetans had no other choice. But even in this agreement, it was stipulated that Tibet would enjoy full autonomy. Although foreign affairs were to be managed by the Chinese government, it was agreed that the Chinese government would not interfere in Tibet's religion and customs, as well as its internal administration. In fact, after the Chinese army occupied Tibet, the Tibetan government did not enjoy any degree of autonomy, even on internal matters, and the Chinese government exercised full power over Tibetan affairs.

In 1956, a Preparatory Committee was established for Tibet, with the Dalai Lama as the chairman, the Panchen Lama as the vice-chairman, and General Zhang Guohua as the representative of the Chinese government. In reality, even this institution had little power, and decisions on all important issues were made by the Chinese authorities. The Dalai Lama and his government had done their utmost to abide by the Seventeen-Point Agreement, but the Chinese authorities had been interfering. By the end of 1955, struggles had already begun in the Kham area, and these struggles became serious in 1956. In the subsequent struggles, Chinese armed forces destroyed many monasteries.

Many lamas were killed, and large numbers of monks and officials were seized to build roads in China, and interference with the exercise of religious freedom increased. From the beginning of February 1959, the relationship between Tibetans and the Chinese openly became tense. The Dalai Lama had agreed a month in advance to attend a cultural performance at the Chinese headquarters, but the date was suddenly set for March 10th. The people of Lhasa feared that the Dalai Lama might be harmed in some way, so about 10,000 people gathered at the Dalai Lama's summer palace in Norbulingka to prevent the Dalai Lama from attending the performance.

After that, the people themselves decided to form a guard to protect the Dalai Lama. Large numbers of Tibetans came to the streets of Lhasa, demonstrating against Chinese rule in Tibet. Two days later, thousands of Tibetan women also demonstrated, protesting Chinese power. Despite these demonstrations by the people, the Dalai Lama and his government strove to maintain friendly relations with the Chinese and tried to negotiate with the Chinese representatives to study how best to bring peace to Tibet and alleviate the anxiety of the people.

While these negotiations were underway, reinforcements were sent to strengthen the Chinese garrison in Lhasa and Tibet. On March 17th, two or three mortar shells were fired at the Norbulingka Palace. Fortunately, the shells all fell into a nearby pond.

After this, advisors recognized the danger to the Dalai Lama's person, and under those difficult circumstances, it became extremely urgent for the Dalai Lama, his family members, and his senior officials to leave Lhasa.

The Dalai Lama wishes to emphatically state that he left Lhasa and Tibet for India of his own free will and was not abducted.

The Dalai Lama was able to reach here from a very difficult route due to the loyalty and enthusiastic support of his people.

The route taken by the Dalai Lama included crossing the Lhasa River and the Yarlung Tsangpo River, passing through the Lhokha region, the Yarlung Valley, and Tsona Dzong, before reaching Khenzimane near the Indian border at Chuthangmu.

On March 29, 1959, the Dalai Lama sent two messengers across the India-Tibet border, requesting the Indian government to allow him to enter India to seek refuge there. The Dalai Lama is extremely grateful for the spontaneous and warm welcome from the people and government of India, and for the right of asylum granted to him and his entourage.

India and Tibet have a thousand-year-old religious, cultural, and trade connection, and for Tibetans, India has always been the civilized country where the Buddha Shakyamuni was born. The Dalai Lama was deeply moved by the kind greetings he received from Prime Minister Nehru and his Indian government colleagues upon his safe arrival in India. The Dalai Lama has replied to this greeting.

Since the Dalai Lama entered India at Khenzimane near Chuthangmu, he has been treated with full respect and hospitality by the people of the Kameng Frontier Division of the Northeast Frontier Agency. The Dalai Lama wishes to state how the Indian government officials there spared no effort to make his stay there and his travel through this well-managed region of India as comfortable as possible.

The Dalai Lama will now travel to Mussoorie, where he hopes to arrive in the next few days. As soon as the Dalai Lama has had an opportunity to rest and reflect on recent events, he will consider his future plans and, if necessary, will immediately state these plans.

His country and people have experienced an extremely difficult period, and all the Dalai Lama wishes to say at present is to express his sincere regret for the tragedy that Tibet has encountered, and he fervently hopes that these difficulties will soon pass and that there will be no more bloodshed.

As the Dalai Lama and the spiritual leader of all Buddhists in Tibet, he is most concerned about the well-being of his people and about ensuring that his sacred religion and the freedom of his country are forever glorified.

The Dalai Lama once again expresses his gratitude for his safe arrival in India, and at the same time, he wishes to take this opportunity to sincerely thank all his friends, well-wishers, and believers in India and abroad for the many telegrams of sympathy and concern they have sent him.

### 所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”全文

    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”全文
    新华社20日讯　据报道，达赖喇嘛在前往他在印度北部的住地穆索里途中，4月18日在提斯浦尔发表了一项声明。这个声明的英文本是由印度外交部官员散发给报界的。印度新闻处广播的这个声明的英文本的译文如下：
    西藏人和中国的汉人是不同的，这一点是一向得到承认的。西藏人一向有一种要求独立的强烈愿望。在整个历史上，曾经多次表明了这一点。有些时候，中国政府把它的宗主权强加在西藏身上，也有些时候，西藏是作为一个独立的国家进行活动的。无论如何，在一切时候，甚至在中国把它的宗主权强加在西藏身上的时候，西藏在管理它的内部事务方面都是自治的。
    1951年，在中国政府的压力下，达成了中国和西藏之间的十七条协议。在那项协议中，接受了中国的宗主权，因为西藏人别无其他办法。但是甚至在这项协议中也规定，西藏将享有充分的自治。虽然对外事务要由中国政府掌管，但是据商定，中国政府将不干涉西藏的宗教和风俗习惯以及它的内部行政。事实上，在中国军队占领西藏以后，西藏政府没有享受任何程度的自治，甚至在内部问题上也是这样，而中国政府对西藏的事务行使全权。
    1956年为西藏成立了一个筹备委员会，达赖喇嘛任主任委员，班禅喇嘛任副主任委员，张国华将军任中国政府的代表。实际上，甚至这个机构也没有什么权力，关于一切重要问题的决定都是由中国当局作出的。达赖喇嘛和他的政府曾经尽最大力量来遵守十七条协议，但是中国当局一直进行干涉。到1955年年底，斗争已经在康省开始了，这个斗争在1956年变得严重起来。在后来进行的斗争中，中国武装部队摧毁了许多寺院。
    许多喇嘛被杀，大批僧人和官员被抓去在中国筑路，对行使宗教自由权的干涉增加了。从1959年2月初起，西藏人同中国的关系公开地变得紧张起来。达赖喇嘛在事前一个月曾同意到中国总部看文艺表演，而日期突然规定在3月10日。拉萨人民担心达赖喇嘛可能受到某种伤害，因此大约有一万人聚集在达赖喇嘛在罗布林卡的夏宫，拦阻达赖喇嘛去看演出。
    在那以后，人民自己决定组成一支卫队来保护达赖喇嘛。大批西藏人来到拉萨街头，举行示威反对中国人统治西藏。两天以后，数以千计的西藏妇女也举行示威，抗议中国的权力。尽管人民举行了这种示威，达赖喇嘛和他的政府还是竭力维持同中国人的友好关系，并且设法同中国代表进行谈判，研究怎样才能最好地给西藏带来和平并且缓和人民的焦虑。
    当这种谈判正在进行的时候，为加强拉萨和西藏的中国驻军而派出的增援部队到达了。3月17日，迫击炮朝着罗布林卡宫打了两三炮。幸而炮弹都落到附近的一个池塘里去了。
    在此以后，顾问们认识到对于达赖喇嘛人身的危险，在那种困难的情况下，对达赖喇嘛、他的家庭成员以及他的高级官员来说，离开拉萨就成为十分紧迫的了。
    达赖喇嘛愿意断然声明，他离开拉萨和西藏到印度来，是出于他自己的自由意志，而不是被劫持。
    达赖喇嘛由于他的人民的忠诚和热情支持，才能够从一条十分艰难的路线到达这里。
    达赖喇嘛所走的这条路线包括渡过拉萨河和雅鲁藏布江，通过山南地区、雅隆谷地和错那宗，然后才到达丘坦穆附近的印度边境坎齐曼。
    1959年3月29日，达赖喇嘛曾派遣两名使者越过印度西藏边境，要求印度政府允许他进入印度，在那里避难。达赖喇嘛极其感激印度人民和政府的自发的和热烈的欢迎，以及给予他和他的随行人员的避难权。
    印度和西藏有着一千年的宗教、文化和贸易联系，对西藏人来说，印度一向是诞生了佛祖释迦的文明之国。达赖喇嘛对于他在安然到达印度时受到尼赫鲁总理和他的印度政府同僚的好心问候深为感动。达赖喇嘛已经答复了这种问候。
    自从达赖喇嘛在丘坦穆附近的坎齐曼入境以来，他受到东北边境特区的卡门边境地区的人民充分的尊敬和殷勤招待。达赖喇嘛希望说明，那里的印度政府官员如何不遗余力地使他在那里的停留和通过印度这个管理得极好的地区的旅行尽可能舒适。
    达赖喇嘛现在将前往穆索里，他希望在今后几天内到达那里。达赖喇嘛一俟有机会休息和回想一下最近的事件，就将考虑他的未来计划，如果有必要的话，并将立即说明这些计划。
  他的国家和人民经历了一个极为困难的时期，达赖喇嘛目前所希望说的只是表示他对于西藏遭遇的悲剧实感遗憾，并且热诚希望这些困难很快就会过去，而不再流血。
    作为达赖喇嘛和西藏一切佛教徒的精神领袖，他最关心的是他的人民的幸福，以及保证他的神圣的宗教和他的国家的自由永远发扬光大。
    达赖喇嘛对于他平安到达印度再次表示感谢，同时希望利用这个机会，向他在印度和国外的一切朋友、为他祝福的人和信徒表示真诚地感谢他们向他发来的许多表示同情和关注的电报。
