From our correspondent in Anshan, April 10th: The famous Youth Unity Furnace – Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 Large Open Hearth Furnace, has exceeded its April production plan of 7,000 tons of high-quality steel eight hours ahead of schedule, achieving a flying start at the beginning of the second quarter and laying the foundation for a greater leap forward in the second quarter compared to the first.

The steel-winning warriors fighting on this large open hearth furnace, after excellently completing the March steelmaking plan with a battle result of increasing production by more than 2,700 tons of high-quality steel, made a great determination to strive for a greater leap forward in the second quarter. Entering April, they held a joint meeting of the four shifts, earnestly summarized the work in March, and launched a red flag competition for more loading and faster refining. "Time is steel." In order to shorten every minute and second, they created the experience of cross-parallel operations of repairing the furnace and loading materials, shortening five or six minutes each time the furnace was repaired and materials were loaded. Each furnace leader mastered the chemical composition of various raw materials, so that the chemical composition of each furnace of molten steel met the quality requirements after refining, thus greatly shortening the smelting time, reducing the average smelting time of each furnace of steel from the national plan of 10 minutes and 30 seconds to more than 9 minutes. According to statistics up to the 9th, in the first nine days of April, 598 tons of high-quality steel have been produced for the country.

From our correspondent in Shanghai, April 10th: The open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 has been striving to complete its plans on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis since April. From the 1st to the 8th, steel production exceeded the plan by 28 tons, and the average daily output increased by 44 tons compared with March, with a quality reaching 99.35%.

This workshop won the national high-yield red flag for open hearth furnaces for the first time in February this year, but the high-yield red flag was snatched back by Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 in March. The workers in this workshop proposed that in April, they must achieve high production every day and high quality in every furnace, and win back the red flag. At the beginning of April, two open hearth furnaces had entered the later stage and were about to undergo major repairs, making production difficult to stabilize. The workshop leaders mobilized the masses, analyzed and studied each furnace of steel, and finally found some operating methods to deal with the furnaces in the later stage. For example, when feeding materials, the method of cross-opening and closing the furnace doors was adopted to keep the temperature inside the furnace from being affected by the feeding and decreasing. In order to accelerate melting and shorten the smelting time, the method of layered thin addition and layered thorough burning was used, which achieved good results. In April, a lot of pig iron was still used. In order to help the open hearth furnace workers desulfurize, the iron smelting section promoted the double-package desulfurization method, which increased the desulfurization effect of pig iron from 40% of the original single-package to more than 70%.

From our correspondent in Taiyuan, April 10th: The employees of the No. 1 Rolling Mill of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company successfully completed the national plan for the first ten days of April. From the 1st to the 10th, a total of 1,000 tons of steel was produced, an increase of 14.5% over the same period last month.

The April plan of the No. 1 Rolling Mill of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company increased by 4% compared to March, but the employees, with the spirit of "thousands of measures, not a single ounce of steel lacking," first fired the first shot of production in the second quarter. In order to fire the first shot and strive for high production, they determined ten major technical measures through airing views at the beginning of April. For example, the workers in the small rolling mill adopted a new automatic runner technology to replace the heavy manual labor of holding steel billets, which greatly improved labor productivity.

Recently, after all the employees thoroughly discussed the call of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to vigorously carry out technological innovation and improve labor productivity, the employees proposed to ensure the overproduction of 2,500 tons of steel to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day. Then, the whole plant further launched a red flag competition. Workers in each workshop and team have formulated specific measures to complete the plan. Factory leaders checked the production situation every day and promptly evaluated the competition, which resulted in a daily increase in steel production.

From our correspondent in Tianjin, April 10th: Li Fenghua team of the small rolling mill workshop of the shaped steel plant of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant, rolled 12 mm rebar today, breaking the highest historical record since the establishment of the plant. The team output reached 102 tons and 155 kilograms, exceeding the team plan for the day by 20.18%.

The team plan for this workshop to roll 12 mm rebar was set at 85 tons. On the night of the 9th, Chen Wende's team had reached 87 tons, exceeding the plan; on the morning of the 10th, when the workers of Li Fenghua's team came to take over, they unanimously vowed to break the 100-ton mark. At that time, they held an emergency pre-shift meeting, studied the existing problems in detail, strengthened the post responsibility system, equipped skilled workers in important places, and conducted mutual competitions. The workers in the steel heating furnace proposed to the steel rolling workers, "You roll as much as we supply, and heat the steel billets thoroughly." The finishing workers also proposed, "You roll as much as we sort out, and we will never let the rolled steel pile up on the battlefield and affect the operation." In this way, they created a new record at 3:00 PM today. (Attached picture)

　　炼钢轧钢上旬喜报飞来
　　鞍钢十号平炉、上钢一厂平炉钢产计划超额完成
　　太钢第一轧钢厂日产量日日上升，天津型钢厂李凤华班创造新纪录
    本报鞍山10日电　著名的青年团结炉——鞍钢第二炼钢厂十号大型平炉，已经提前八个小时超额完成4月上旬生产七千吨优质钢的计划，在第二季度一开始就赢得开门红，为第二季度比第一季来个更大跃进打下基础。
    战斗在这座大型平炉上的夺钢战士们，以增产两千七百多吨优质钢的战果，出色地完成了3月份炼钢计划之后，就立大志要在第二季度争取更大跃进。进入4月，他们召开了四班联席会议，认真地总结了3月份工作，展开多装快炼的红旗竞赛运动。“时间就是钢”，为了缩短一分一秒时间，他们创造了补炉和装料交叉平行作业的经验，每补一次炉装一次料就缩短了五、六分钟。每个炉长都掌握好各种原料的化学成分，使得每炉钢水炼好之后，化学成分多符合质量要求，因而大大缩短了熔炼时间，把每炉钢的熔炼时间平均从国家计划十点三十分钟缩短到九点多钟。据截至9日的统计，在4月头九天里，已经为国家增产了五百九十八吨优质钢。
    本报上海10日电　上海第一钢铁厂平炉车间，4月份以来，力争按日、按旬、按月完成计划。1到8日为止，钢产量超额二十八吨完成了计划，平均日产量比3月份提高了四十四吨，质量达到99.35％。
    这个车间在今年2月份第一次夺得全国平炉高产红旗，但3月份高产红旗又被上钢三厂抢回去。这个车间的工人们提出，4月份一定要实现日日高产、炉炉优质，夺回红旗，4月初两个平炉已经进入后期阶段，即将中修，生产不易稳定，车间领导上就发动群众，每炼一炉钢就进行分析研究，终于摸到一些对付后期炉子的操作方法。例如，在进料时采取炉门交叉启闭的办法，保持炉内温度不受进料影响而降低。为了加速溶化，缩短冶炼时间，用分层薄加，分层烧透的办法，收到了很好的效果。4月份生铁仍然用的很多，化铁炉工段为了帮助平炉工人去硫，推行了双包去硫法，使生铁去硫效果从原来单包的40％提高到70％以上。
    本报太原10日电　太原钢铁公司第一轧钢厂职工胜利地完成了4月上旬的国家计划。1日至10日共生产了一千吨钢材，比上月同期增长了14.5％。
    太钢第一轧钢厂4月份计划比3月份增长了4％，但职工们以“措施千方百计、钢材斤两不缺”的精神，首先打响了第二季度生产的第一炮。为了打响第一炮，力争高产，他们在4月初就通过鸣放，确定了十大技术措施。例如小型轧钢车间工人们采用了自动跑槽新技术，代替了长期以来人工挟钢坯的笨重劳动，这就大大提高了劳动生产率。
    最近全厂职工深入地讨论了中共太原市委提出的大搞技术革新提高劳动生产率的号召以后，职工们提出要保证超产二千五百吨钢材来迎接“五一”劳动节。接着全厂进一步开展了红旗竞赛运动。各个车间、小组工人们都制订了完成计划的具体措施。厂领导干部日日检查生产情况，及时评比竞赛，结果使钢材日产量逐日上升。
    本报天津10日电　天津市第一钢厂型钢厂小型轧钢机车间李凤华班，今天轧制十二毫米螺纹钢，打破了建厂以来的最高历史纪录，班产量达到一百零二吨又一百五十五公斤，超过当天班计划20.18％。
    这个车间制定轧制十二毫米螺纹钢的跃进计划班产为八十五吨。9日夜陈文德班已达八十七吨，超额完成了计划；10日晨，李凤华班的工人来接班时，一致发誓要打破百吨大关。当时他们召开了一次紧急的班前会，详细地研究了以往存在的问题，加强了岗位责任制，重要的地方配备了熟练工人，并相互进行竞赛，烘钢炉的工人向轧钢工人提出“你们轧多少，我们供应多少，把钢坯烘透烘好。”精整工人也提出了“你们轧多少，我们就整理多少，绝不让轧出的钢材堆在战场上影响操作。”这样，他们便在今天下午三时创造了新纪录。（附图片）
