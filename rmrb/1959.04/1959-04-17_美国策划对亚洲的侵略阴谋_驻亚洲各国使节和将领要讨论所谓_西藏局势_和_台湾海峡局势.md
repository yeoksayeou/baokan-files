Xinhua News Agency, April 15th, Manila dispatch: American diplomatic envoys and military generals stationed in Asian countries began a meeting in Baguio, Philippines yesterday.
    It is worth noting that this meeting is being held after the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization plotted further aggression and interference in Asian countries at the council meeting in Wellington. Presiding over this meeting is none other than U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon, who led the U.S. delegation to the Wellington meeting. According to Western news agencies, American diplomatic envoys and military generals stationed in Asian countries are discussing the so-called "Tibetan situation" and the so-called "Taiwan Strait situation," issues that are entirely within China's internal affairs, at the meeting in Baguio.
    As previously reported, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization discussed the above two issues at the Wellington meeting. The fact that U.S. diplomatic officials and military generals in Asia are discussing these issues again at the Baguio meeting indicates that the U.S. government, which persists in being hostile to the Chinese people, is attempting to plot new conspiratorial activities regarding the rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, and is stepping up its plotting of conspiracies to interfere with China's liberation of its own territory and to launch new military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area.
    According to Western news agencies, the meeting in Baguio will also discuss "Cold War policies" and "U.S. Far East policy."
    Xinhua News Agency, April 15th, Singapore dispatch: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization began yesterday the largest naval and air force exercise since the establishment of this aggressive military bloc. This military exercise, decided upon by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization at its Wellington meeting, aims to aggravate the tense situation in the region and threaten the peace and security of Asian countries.
    It is reported that thirty warships from the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and France participating in this exercise left Singapore yesterday and are conducting exercises on the vast sea surface of the South China Sea from Singapore to Manila. Western news agencies say that this is the second time since World War II that this aggressive bloc has assembled so many ships in Singapore.

　　美国策划对亚洲的侵略阴谋
　　驻亚洲各国使节和将领要讨论所谓“西藏局势”和“台湾海峡局势”
    新华社15日讯　马尼拉消息：美国驻亚洲国家的外交使节和军事将领们昨天开始在菲律宾的碧瑶举行会议。
    值得注意的是，这次会议是在东南亚条约组织在惠灵顿举行的理事会会议上策划了进一步侵略和干涉亚洲国家的阴谋以后举行的。主持这次会议的正是率领美国代表团参加惠灵顿会议的美国副国务卿狄龙。据西方通讯社透露，美国驻亚洲国家的外交使节和军事将领们在碧瑶举行的会议上讨论完全属于中国内政的所谓“西藏局势”问题和所谓“台湾海峡局势”问题。
    前已报道，东南亚条约组织在惠灵顿会议上，就曾经讨论了上述两个问题。美国驻亚洲的外交官员和军事将领们在碧瑶会议上将再次讨论这些问题，这表明，坚持同中国人民为敌的美国政府正在企图就西藏上层反动集团的叛乱事件策划新的阴谋活动，并且加紧策划干涉中国解放自己的领土和在台湾海峡地区发动新的军事挑衅的阴谋。
    据西方通讯社透露，在碧瑶举行的这次会议还将讨论“冷战政策”和“美国的远东政策”。
    新华社15日讯　新加坡消息：东南亚条约组织昨天开始举行这个侵略性军事集团成立以来的规模最大的一次海空军演习。东南亚条约组织在它的惠灵顿会议上决定举行的这次军事演习，在于加剧这一地区的紧张局势和威胁亚洲国家的和平和安全。
    据报道，参加这次演习的美国、英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和法国的三十艘军舰已经在昨天离开新加坡，在从新加坡到马尼拉的南中国海的广阔海面上举行演习。西方通讯社说，这个侵略集团在新加坡集结这样多的舰只是第二次世界大战后没有过的。
