    Multiple Births – An Important Measure for Developing Animal Husbandry
    Du Gurzab, Director of the Animal Husbandry Bureau of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    Animal husbandry mainly relies on the reproduction of livestock to expand reproduction. To develop animal husbandry at a high speed, we must first take measures to improve the reproduction and survival rate of livestock. In the reproduction of sheep and goats, some people in the past believed that one litter per year and one lamb per litter for female animals was a matter of course and could not be changed. This superstitious thinking also hindered the high-speed development of our animal husbandry. Since the Great Leap Forward, we have broken with this superstition, liberated our minds, criticized the various erroneous arguments that "livestock reproduction cannot leap forward," established a banner, and carried out technical reforms, thereby greatly promoting the rate of increase in sheep. The year before last, the Aohan Banner sheep farm in Zhaowuda League of the Autonomous Region injected pregnant mare serum into ewes, bringing the twin birth rate to 50%. After the people's communes were established last year, this bold experiment was quickly popularized throughout the region, resulting in more and better high-yield models, and this experience was further enriched through practice. In order to ensure the high-speed development of animal husbandry, herdsmen and farmers in the Autonomous Region are currently carrying out a large-scale and productive animal husbandry movement of two litters per year and three litters in two years. This is also a new attempt, and the herdsmen are very willing to do so. Last winter, after 200,000 ewes in Hangjin Banner, Yikezhao League gave birth to lambs, the herdsmen then proceeded with mating, and this batch of ewes will be able to give birth to lambs again in May of this year. It is estimated that more than one million such "second litter lambs" can be mated throughout the region this year. This provides extremely important and favorable conditions for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production in the Autonomous Region this year.
    The practical experience in Inner Mongolia has proved that as long as we pay serious attention to strengthening feeding management and carrying out technical reforms in animal husbandry production, we can not only promote two litters a year and three litters in two years, but also promote multiple births of twins and triplets in large groups of female animals, thereby realizing a higher speed of development in animal husbandry production. The basic experience of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in carrying out the "multiple births" movement is, first of all, to adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously carry out the technical reform movement in animal husbandry production. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, due to the widespread and deep-rooted idea of developing animal husbandry at a high speed, under the slogan of "two litters a year, three litters in two years, multiple births per litter, and 100% survival rate," a style of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to create boldly was established, and a mass movement for high-speed development of animal husbandry was quickly launched. On this basis, leading cadres at all levels of the Party and government and animal husbandry and veterinary technical departments universally started experimental groups, closely combining science and technology with the experience of the masses. This laid the ideological foundation for carrying out the "multiple births" movement and developing animal husbandry at a high speed. The second is to lead the herdsmen to pay serious attention to improving livestock feeding management, strive to learn animal husbandry production technology, and grasp the livestock's fatness, and carry out mating on the basis of full fatness. High-speed increase in livestock must be achieved under good feeding management conditions. In 1958, all animal husbandry production infrastructure construction in the Autonomous Region made great leaps forward compared with previous years, and the harvesting of grass, digging of wells, and construction of sheds and fences all increased significantly. Animal husbandry and veterinary prevention work also achieved remarkable results, and a large number of mating personnel and pregnant mare serum injection technicians were also trained. In terms of technology, the most important thing is to do a good job in the injection of pregnant mare serum. Injecting pregnant mare serum subcutaneously into estrous ewes to promote multiple births is a stimulating effect of estrus. That is, taking out a kind of estrus element from the blood of pregnant animals that can cause multiple ovulation of the ovaries under natural conditions, and injecting this pregnant serum into another animal will, within a certain period of time, promote the active activity of the animal's reproductive glands, forming multiple births and high yields. From our preliminary experiments, under the conditions of improved feeding management, using this method can achieve good results for both Mongolian sheep and crossbred sheep.

    一胎多羔——发展畜牧业的重要措施
    内蒙古自治区畜牧厅厅长　都固尔扎布
    畜牧业主要是依靠牲畜的繁殖来扩大再生产的。要高速度地发展畜牧业，首先就必须采取措施，提高牲畜的繁殖成活率。在绵羊、山羊的繁殖方面，过去有人认为母畜一年一胎，一胎一羔是天经地义的事，无法改变。这种迷信思想，也妨碍过我们畜牧业的高速度发展。大跃进以来，我们破除这种迷信，解放思想，批判了“牲畜繁殖不能跃进”的种种错误论点，树立旗帜，开展了技术改革，从而大大促进了羊只的增殖速度。前年，自治区昭乌达盟敖汉旗羊场给母羊注射妊娠马血清，使母羊的双胎率达到50％。去年人民公社化后，这一大胆的试验很快就在全区各地普遍推广起来，从而出现了更多更好的高产典型，并且通过实践更加丰富了这一经验。自治区牧民和农民，为了保证畜牧业的高速度发展，目前正在开展一项一年两产和两年三产的牲畜大群丰产运动。这也是一个新的尝试，牧民们非常乐意。去冬，伊克昭盟杭锦旗有二十万只母羊产羔后，牧民接着又进行配种，这批母羊在今年5月间又可以产羔了。预计今年全区可以配种这样的“二茬羔”百万多只。这就为今年自治区畜牧业生产的高速度发展，提供了极其重要的有利条件。
    内蒙古地区的实践经验证明，只要认真注意加强饲养管理，开展畜牧业生产的技术改革，不仅可以促成一年两产，两年三产，而且还可以促成大群母畜一胎生双羔和三羔，从而实现畜牧业生产的更高速度发展。内蒙古自治区开展“一胎多羔”运动的基本经验，首先是坚持政治挂帅，大搞畜牧业生产技术改革运动。1958年大跃进以后，由于高速度发展畜牧业的思想普遍深入人心，在“一年两胎，两年三胎，一胎多羔，百生百活”的口号下，树立了敢想敢干敢于大胆创造的风格，迅速掀起了高速度发展畜牧业的群众运动。在这基础上，各级党政领导干部及畜牧兽医技术部门，普遍动手搞试验群，把科学技术和群众经验紧密地结合起来。这就为开展“一胎多羔”运动及高速度发展畜牧业奠定了思想基础。其次是领导牧民，认真注意改善牲畜饲养管理，努力学习畜牧业生产技术，抓好畜膘，在满膘的基础上进行配种。高速度地增殖牲畜，必须是在良好的饲养管理条件下才能得到。自治区1958年各项畜牧业生产基本建设，都比往年有了很大的跃进，打草、打井、修建棚圈，都大量的增加。畜牧兽医防治工作也获得了显著成绩，同时还培养了大批配种员和注射妊娠马血清技术人员。在技术方面，最重要的是做好妊娠马血清的注射。把妊娠马血清注射于发情母羊皮下，促使母羊产多羔，是一种动情素的刺激作用。就是由妊娠动物血液中，取出一种在自然条件下能够引起卵巢多排卵的动情素，把这种妊娠血清注射到另一动物体内，在一定时间就会促进动物的生殖腺体积极活动起来，形成多胎多产。从我们的初步试验中看，在改善饲养管理的条件下，使用这一方法，不论对蒙古羊或杂种羊，都可以收到良好的效果。
