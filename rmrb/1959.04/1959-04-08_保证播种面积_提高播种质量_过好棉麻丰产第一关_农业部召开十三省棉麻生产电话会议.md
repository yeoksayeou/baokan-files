Xinhua News Agency, 5th. To strive for even greater leaps and bumper harvests in cotton and hemp production this year, the Ministry of Agriculture, at a telephone conference on cotton and hemp production in thirteen provinces on the evening of April 3rd, called on all localities to focus on the first hurdle of cotton and hemp production – the sowing stage – to complete this year's cotton and hemp sowing tasks with guaranteed quality and quantity, and at the appropriate time.

Participating in the conference were the directors of agriculture departments and bureaus from thirteen major cotton and hemp producing provinces, including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shanxi, and Sichuan. The meeting was presided over by Cai Ziwei, Vice Minister of Agriculture.

After listening to reports on the preparations for cotton and hemp sowing and the sowing situation in Hebei, Hubei, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Hunan provinces, the conference pointed out that the preparations for cotton and hemp sowing were better than in any previous year, and large-scale cotton sowing work was gradually unfolding from south to north, with hemp sowing work also about to be widely launched.

Regarding cotton sowing, the conference required all localities to first ensure the completion of the sown area according to the national plan, ensuring that cotton fields in old cotton-growing areas are not reduced, and that new cotton-growing areas complete their planting area plans. New cotton-growing areas with larger area expansions should implement planting plans and pay attention to resolving cotton planting technical problems, either by holding training courses to train technicians or by inviting instructors from old cotton-growing areas. Strive for simultaneous leaps forward in concentrated cotton-growing areas and dispersed cotton-growing areas, and for double bumper harvests in both old and new cotton-growing areas. Secondly, improve sowing quality. Sow early at the appropriate time, shorten the sowing period, and strive to complete sowing in a concentrated effort within a few days, aiming for one sowing, one full stand of seedlings, and strong seedlings. The main tasks to achieve this are: to prepare the land well, check the soil moisture, prepare enough selected seeds, practice seed dressing with Ceresan or Xilixin, prepare sowing equipment, and train sowing personnel. In order to ensure that cotton seedlings are uniform, cotton seedlings that are raised and transplanted should be sorted and transplanted according to their size. Improving sowing quality can ensure one mu of planting is secure, and it can also promote early flowering of cotton before the midsummer heat and more pre-midsummer bolls, which is very important for cotton harvests, and all localities must pay attention to it. Third, do a good job in seedling emergence work, and strive for full and strong seedlings. If the soil surface hardens after sowing, it should be broken up in time using methods such as horizontal harrows to allow the cotton seedlings to emerge easily. If full or uniform seedling emergence has not been achieved after emergence, replanting and transplanting should be carried out in a timely manner. It is also necessary to do a good job in preventing and controlling pests and diseases, actively produce local pesticide machinery, and repair damaged pesticide machinery. Fourth, close planting of cotton is an important measure to increase production, but it must be reasonably densely planted according to different soils, land fertility, and different varieties. Overly dense or sparse planting will affect cotton production. The number of seedlings to be retained per mu should be determined by following the mass line and consulting with the masses. Fifth, focus on large-area high-yield fields. The planned area for high-yield cotton fields in each province is 25 million to 30 million mu, with per-mu yield targets mostly between 300 and 500 jin of ginned cotton. Technical guidance for high-yield cotton fields must be strengthened. High-yield cotton fields should select the best or better cultivated land and cultivate it according to garden-like standards; apply sufficient fertilizer; improve water conservancy conditions so that cotton is not afraid of waterlogging or drought; and also do a good job in plant protection and field management. All measures are for early boll formation, more boll formation, and the formation of large bolls.

The conference required all localities to do the following tasks in hemp sowing: First, ensure the completion of the sown area plan and improve sowing quality. The self-sufficient hemp and commercial hemp planted by the people's communes should be planned in a unified manner, and attention should be paid to appropriately concentrating planting on good land to facilitate leadership and management and improve yields. Improve sowing quality, and strive for one sowing, one full stand of seedlings, and strong seedlings. Second, in order to increase production, all localities should launch a large-area high-yield campaign for hemp production. Third, this year's new hemp fields have expanded greatly, and the new hemp-growing areas lack hemp-growing technology. Therefore, all localities should seize the opportunity to conduct technical training or use the method of inviting instructors to solve technical problems. Fourth, vigorously reform hemp stripping tools. Hemp stripping is labor-intensive, and this year's hemp production has increased much more than last year, making the hemp stripping task even more arduous. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the hemp stripping tool reform work from now on.

### 保证播种面积　提高播种质量  过好棉麻丰产第一关  农业部召开十三省棉麻生产电话会议

    保证播种面积　提高播种质量
    过好棉麻丰产第一关
    农业部召开十三省棉麻生产电话会议
    新华社5日讯　为了争取今年棉麻生产有更大的跃进、更大的丰收，农业部在4月3日晚召开的十三省棉麻生产电话会议上，号召各地要抓好棉麻生产第一关——棉麻播种关，保质保量适时地完成今年棉麻播种任务。
    参加这次会议的有主要产棉麻的河北、河南、山东、陕西、湖北、湖南、安徽、江苏、浙江、江西、广东、山西、四川等十三个省的农业厅局长。会议由农业部副部长蔡子伟主持。
    会议在听取了河北、湖北、安徽、浙江、湖南等省棉麻播种准备和播种情况的汇报后，指出棉麻播种准备工作比过去任何一年都好，大规模的棉花播种工作正在由南向北逐步展开，麻的播种工作也即将普遍地展开。
    在棉花播种方面，会议要求各地首先必须按照国家计划保证完成播种面积，做到老棉区棉田不减少，新棉区保证完成种植面积计划。扩大面积较多的新棉区，要把种植计划落实，并注意解决植棉技术问题，办法是开办训练班训练技术人员或是到老棉区请辅导员。做到集中棉区和分散棉区齐跃进，新老棉区双丰收。其次，提高播种质量。适时早播，缩短播种期，争取几天内突击完成播种，力争一次播种，一次全苗，苗齐苗旺。做好这一工作主要是：把地整好，查好墒情，准备足够的粒选种子，实行赛力散或西力生拌种，准备好播种器，训练好播种手。为了使棉苗整齐一致，育苗移栽的棉花，要按棉苗的大小不同，进行分类排队移栽。提高播种质量可以种一亩保一亩，还可以促使棉花在入伏前早开花，多结伏前桃，这对棉花丰收的关系很大，各地必须抓好。第三，做好出苗工作，力争苗齐苗旺。播种后遇到地皮板结，应及时用横耙等方法进行破碎，使棉苗好出土。出苗后没有达到全苗和齐苗的，要及时进行补种、移栽。还要做好防治病虫害的工作，积极生产土农药械，已损坏了的药械也要修理好。第四，棉花密植是增产的重要措施，但是，必须根据不同的土壤、土地的肥瘦和不同的品种，进行合理密植，过密或过稀都会影响棉花的产量。每亩留苗多少株为好，要走群众路线，同群众商量确定。第五，抓好大面积丰产田。各省计划种植丰产棉田的面积有两千五百万亩到三千万亩，亩产指标大部分在三百斤到五百斤皮棉。要切实加强丰产棉田的技术指导。丰产棉田要选择最好的或较好的耕地，并按照园田化的标准进行耕作；施足肥料；搞好水利条件，使棉花不怕涝不怕旱；还要作好植物保护和田间管理工作。一切措施是为了早结桃、多结桃、结大桃。
    会议要求各地在麻的播种工作上，要做好以下几项工作：第一，要保证完成播种面积计划和提高播种质量。各人民公社种植的自给性的麻和商品麻要统筹安排，并且应注意适当集中种植，种在好地上，以便于领导和管理，提高产量。提高播种质量，力争做到一次播种，一次全苗，苗全苗旺。第二，为了提高产量，各地要开展一个麻类生产大面积丰产运动。第三，今年的新麻田扩大很多，新麻区缺乏种麻技术，因此，各地要抓紧进行技术训练或请辅导员的办法，来解决技术问题。第四，大力改革剥麻工具。剥麻费工多，今年麻的产量又比去年增产很多，剥麻任务更加繁重，因此，从现在起就要抓紧剥麻工具改革工作。
