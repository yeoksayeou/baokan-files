　　Zhao's Orphan
　　(Performed by the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe)

　　Zhao's Orphan is a well-known play, and the Qinqiang Opera Troupe from Shaanxi recently received critical acclaim for their performance in Beijing. However, the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe's performance has its own characteristics and its own successes.

　　First of all, the script itself has its own characteristics: it adds the "Meeting the Mother" scene, which prepares for the "Viewing the Painting" scene, making Zhao Wu eager to know the truth. Appropriately concentrating the scenes during the torture scene is also good. Overall, this adaptation is relatively complete, and although it boldly deletes certain scenes and segments from the traditional Peking Opera performance, the deletions are well done.

　　What is most gratifying is that a play with a director, compared to those performed arbitrarily by actors, gives the audience the feeling that it is greatly improved both ideologically and artistically. In this performance, Tan Fuying and Ma Lianliang broke their own performance records. Tan Fuying's remonstrance with Duke Ling in the "Playing the Ball" scene is already able to express a sense of uprightness and sharpness. The Zuo Zhuan says, "Zhao Dun is like the summer sun." This person was a bit frightening to those villains and unprincipled rulers, so they tried to kill him. I hope Comrade Tan Fuying can strengthen this aspect even more. Ma Lianliang performed very well this time, especially portraying the mental torment he suffered for fifteen years, his physical decline, and his unfulfilled ambitions, clinging stubbornly to life solely due to the will to avenge. The "Viewing the Painting" scene is particularly outstanding. In addition, the director's final handling of his death is also well done. Tan Yuanshou's Zhao Wu this time is also very good, and his collaboration with Ma Lianliang in the "Viewing the Painting" scene makes it even more brilliant. It's a pity that I didn't see Qiu Shengrong perform in the performance I watched. Although Tu Anjia also performed passably, he was weaker in comparison. Wei Jiang is too weak, which brings some loss to the play.

　　The play also has some shortcomings, mainly the lack of concentrated, good singing. In addition, there are too many fragmented singing parts, which appear monotonous and trivial. Although there is the "Meeting the Mother" scene, the singing is not fully expressed and fails to reach its full potential. Is it because they are afraid to sing freely, considering the play is too long? In places where there is singing, such as "Stealing the Orphan," the singing is not beautiful enough, or is it because the rhythm is not well-arranged? In short, this aspect does not leave a deep impression.

　　The direction and set design are successful, and the design and staging of the torture scene are very atmospheric.

　　Unnamed Island (Performed by the Youth Art Theatre)

　　This is a spoken drama reflecting the story of the battle on the Fujian front. This is the first time I have seen this type of subject matter in a spoken drama.

　　This is a play with a strong atmosphere of combat. It features many heroic deeds and lovable characters, but the overall tone does not feel heavy. Instead, it is full of witty and lively plots, making people feel that these positive characters appearing on the stage are engaged in combat with a spirit of optimism. It seems that a life of risking life and limb in the turbulent waves is commonplace for them, and without such a life, it would be impossible to recognize their faces and understand their spirit. Not only that, it also encourages us, entices us, and makes us admire this kind of life and wish to fight with them in the waves.

　　The characters in this play are relatively distinct, such as the political instructor, the soldiers, the young fisherman, and the characters on the enemy side, each with their own personality. Some of them, such as the captured enemy artilleryman and the old cook, are written relatively well.

　　In terms of performance, it strives to break away from the old conventions and create a new style. It has achieved some success in being bright and lively and in eliminating the cumbersome use of scenery. Recently, spoken dramas have been consciously working to overcome naturalistic tendencies, and this practice has yielded gratifying results.

　　However, in terms of performance, the characterization also seems insufficient. This kind of brisk play requires the characters to have clear outlines. Therefore, in language, action, and even the overall character design, one should not be afraid of appropriate exaggeration and contrast between the characters. In this regard, this play feels lacking. A few actors are relatively good, such as a certain squad leader (frogman) of the enemy army, the enemy army's quartermaster, and the young fisherman on our side, all of whom perform vividly. However, the soldiers and political instructor on our side have a somewhat unclear sense of outline. The political instructor only performs well in the negotiation scene, and the rest of the scenes always feel lacking. Especially in dealing with prisoners, he seems to lack vigilance and is a bit like an "old good guy."

　　In general, although this is a three-hour play, due to its lively atmosphere, active movements, and witty plot arrangements, it does not feel tiring to watch, as if reading a lively combat lyrical novel. Such a play is sure to be very palatable to the audience of our heroic era.

　　赵氏孤儿
　　（北京京剧团演出）
    赵氏孤儿是一出熟戏，最近陕西的秦腔剧团在北京演出获得了好评。然而北京京剧团的演出自有它的特点，自有它的成功之处。
    首先在编剧上就有特点：增加了遇母一场，这样就给观画一场作了准备，使得赵武迫切要求知道事情的真像。拷打一场适当地把场子集中起来也是很好的。整个来说，这回的改编较完整，虽然大胆地删除了京剧传统演法中的某些场子和段落，还是删得好的。
    最使人高兴的是，这样一个有导演的戏比起那些由演员随意表演的戏来，给观众的感觉是无论思想上和艺术上都大大提高了。谭富英、马连良在这次演出中间，从表演上突破了他们本人的纪录。谭富英在打弹一场面谏灵公已经能够表现出刚直凌厉之气，左传上说，“赵盾，夏日之日也”。这个人对于那些小人和无道之君来说，是有点可怕的，所以他们才要设法杀他。希望谭富英同志在这方面更加强一些。马连良这次表演得很出色，尤其把十五年后的备受精神磨折，体力已衰而大志未酬，仅仅由于复仇的意志撑持着而顽强地生活下去的精神状态表演得很好，观画一场尤其突出。再加上导演最后处理他终于死去也是很好的。谭元寿这次的赵武也很不错，观画一场和马连良合作起来更显得精采。可惜我看的一场裘盛戎没有上场，屠岸贾虽也演得过得去，但比起来就弱一点了。魏绛太弱，给戏带来一些损失。
    戏也有些缺点，主要是没有较集中的好唱，另外零零碎碎的唱又太多，显得单调琐碎，虽有遇母一场，但唱未尽情，未能发挥。是不是考虑到戏太长而不敢放手唱呢？有唱的地方如盗孤，唱腔也不够美，或者是因为板安得不好的原故吗？总之，这方面没有给人很深的印象。
    导演和装置是成功的，拷打一场的设计和排演很有气氛。
    无名岛（青年艺术剧院演出）
    这是一个反映福建前线战斗故事的话剧。这方面的题材，在话剧里我看到的还是第一个。
    这是一个战斗气氛很浓的戏，其中出现了很多英勇事迹和可爱的人物形象，但整个的调子却并不感到沉重，反而充满着机智活泼的情节，使人觉得在舞台上出现的这些正面人物是充满着乐观的精神在从事战斗，仿佛在惊涛骇浪中出生入死的生活对于他们竟是家常便饭，离开这样的生活就无法认识他们的面貌，理解他们的精神。不仅如此，它还鼓舞我们，引诱我们，使我们多么羡慕这种生活，多希望和他们一起到波涛中去战斗。
    这个戏的人物比较鲜明，如指导员、战士、年轻渔夫，以及敌人方面的人物，也都还各有个性，其中少数的如被俘的敌人炮长、老伙伕等写得比较好。
    在演出上是力求打破老一套，创造新风格的。在明快活泼这一点上，在用景的务去繁琐这一点上，是获得了一定的成功的。近来话剧在克服自然主义倾向这方面是有意识地下着工夫，从这回的实践上看，也得到了可喜的收获。
    但在表演方面，人物的刻划也显得不足。这种风格明快的戏，在人物的轮廓上是要力求鲜明的，因之在语言、动作，以至整个人物造型上就不应害怕适当的夸张和角色之间的对比，在这方面，这个戏就感到不足了。有少数的演员比较好，如敌军的某班长（水鬼），敌军的军需，我方的年轻渔夫，都演得比较鲜明。但是我方的战士和指导员都有轮廓不太清晰之感。指导员只在谈判一场演得好，其余几场总觉还不像。特别是对待俘虏，似乎很缺警惕性，有点像个老好人。
    总的说，这虽是一个三个钟头的戏，由于它活泼的气氛，活跃的动作，机智的情节安排，看起来并不吃力，仿佛在读一首活泼的战斗抒情小说一样。这样的戏，对于我们这个英雄时代的观众来说，一定是很合胃口的。
