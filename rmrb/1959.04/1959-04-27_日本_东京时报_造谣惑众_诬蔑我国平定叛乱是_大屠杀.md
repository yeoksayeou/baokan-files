Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: The Japanese "Tokyo Times," acting as a cheerleader for Indian expansionists, maliciously distorts the truth of the Tibetan rebellion and engages in large-scale defamation of China.

This newspaper slanders the actions of our People's Liberation Army in suppressing armed Tibetan bandits as "the Chinese Communist Party firing on unarmed Tibetan public" and "a massacre." It also fans the flames by saying that "Japan should not adopt an indifferent attitude towards it."

Echoing the tone of the imperialists, this newspaper shouts that China is "interfering in Tibet's internal administration." It further fabricates that China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is "a demonstration to divert the Communist China's people's increasing dissatisfaction with the forcibly implemented commune system." It even nonsensically claims that "the commune system will cause a serious internal turmoil." However, one only needs to point out the facts that the Chinese people are united as one, continuing the Great Leap Forward with full confidence, and are rising up against the Indian expansionists' conspiracy to include China's Tibet in the Indian map to completely shatter the above-mentioned rumors of the "Tokyo Times."

    日本“东京时报”造谣惑众
    诬蔑我国平定叛乱是“大屠杀”
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本“东京时报”充当印度扩张主义分子的拉拉队，恶意歪曲西藏叛乱事件真相，大肆诽谤中国。
    这家报纸污蔑我人民解放军平定西藏武装叛匪的行动是“中国共产党向手无寸铁的西藏公众开枪”。是“一次大屠杀”。它还煽风点火地说什么“日本不应当对它采取漠不关心的态度”。
    这家报纸学着帝国主义的调子，叫喊什么中国“干涉西藏的内部行政”，它还更进一步捏造中国平定西藏叛乱是“为了转移共产党中国老百姓对强制实行的公社制度的日益不满情绪而举行的示威”。甚至胡说什么“公社制度将引起一场严重的内乱”。但是人们只要指出中国人民团结一致、满怀信心地继续大跃进并且群起反对印度扩张主义分子妄图把中国的西藏划入印度版图的阴谋活动这些事实，就可以完全粉碎“东京时报”的上述谣言。
