We Must Run Workers' Spare-Time Schools Well
Chengdu Comprehensively Rectifies Workers' Spare-Time Education, Teaching Work Makes Significant Progress

(Our report) Chengdu has universally rectified worker education, enabling various types of worker spare-time schools to be further developed, consolidated, and improved. Currently, the city has more than 480 various worker schools, with enrollment increasing from over 80,000 at the end of last year to over 130,000, accounting for more than 53% of the city's total number of workers. Many large and medium-sized factories have established relatively complete education systems. Recent survey data indicate that over 80% of the schools have basically resolved issues related to teaching time, textbooks, and teachers, and the quality of teaching has also improved.

Chengdu's rectification work on worker education began at the end of last year. During the rectification, they focused on strengthening the Party organization's leadership over education work, improving teaching work in accordance with the Party's education policy, cultivating, improving, and enriching the teaching staff, and properly arranging study time as important links. Since the end of last year, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee and the Industrial Department have convened factory-run school meetings several times, requiring Party organizations at all levels to strengthen specific leadership over worker education, ensuring that each school established is consolidated. Factories have also successively convened enlarged meetings of the Party Committee and organized leading cadres at the workshop level to deeply study and discuss the central government's instructions on education work, further boosting the enthusiasm for engaging in production and running education. Factories such as the Southwest Radio Equipment Factory and the No. 1 Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory, under the leadership of the Party Committee, established specialized agencies to lead worker education, and designated a Party Committee Secretary, Deputy Factory Director, or Party Committee member to specifically take charge, uniformly researching, arranging, and inspecting education work. Factories such as the Chengdu Transportation Machinery Factory also adopted a method of level-by-level responsibility, putting forward specific requirements for each workshop to carry out worker education, and establishing a system of reporting on production and education simultaneously. In this way, the leadership of Party organizations at all levels over worker schools has become more in-depth and specific, and worker education has presented a vigorous new situation.

Party organizations at all levels, in accordance with the Party's education policy and the specific conditions of their factories, have first concentrated their efforts on strengthening teaching work and improving teaching quality during the rectification work. Many factories, under the leadership of the Party Committee, have established three-way combination groups of teachers, workers, and technicians. In the teaching reform, they have adopted the principle of starting from production and serving production; determining the content of technical education based on the needs of production development, and determining the content of cultural basic knowledge education based on the needs of technical education and future improvement. In this way, the teaching of worker schools is closely integrated with the actual production of the factory, while taking into account the needs for future improvement. The Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, in organizing members of the teaching improvement group to go deep into the workshops to understand the needs of workers, discovered many problems existing in past teaching, and collected many specific suggestions from workers for improving teaching work; the new teaching plan and syllabus they compiled changed the past situation of repetitive and cumbersome content, divorced from production reality, and not only more in line with the needs of the factory and the characteristics of adult learning, but also added political classes and increased knowledge of modern scientific achievements such as semiconductors and atomic physics.

Cultivating, improving, and enriching the teaching staff is an important task that the Party organizations of various factories and enterprises have attached great importance to in rectifying worker education. According to statistics from thirty-nine factories, there are already more than 1,800 full-time and part-time teachers. At the same time, many factories have also adopted the principle of "those who are capable can be teachers," continuing to select part-time teachers from among the factory's workers; selecting experienced workers with a certain level of education and training them to become full-time teachers; organizing existing teachers to participate in production labor and political theory studies, carrying out teaching research and experience exchange activities, and organizing professional training. The Municipal Education Bureau and relevant departments in the East City and West City districts have also held short-term teacher training classes and professional knowledge lectures to help worker school teachers improve their teaching ability. After this series of work, the teaching quality of many schools has improved significantly.

In addition to this, general factories and enterprises have also paid attention to comprehensively and properly arranging production and study time. Many factory Party organizations have assigned study tasks at the same time as assigning production tasks, and have also uniformly arranged the time for various spare-time activities. In this way, many factories have seen a new atmosphere of persisting in study and promoting production. Among the 753 workers in the Hongan Machine Factory, 752 have attended spare-time schools. Because the factory improved labor organization, carried out technical innovation, administrative cadres participated in labor, and properly arranged spare time, etc., the workers put forward and realized 41 major technical innovation suggestions, increasing work efficiency by two to three or four times. Therefore, in the high-yield week of February, they also overfulfilled the factory's production tasks by 3.7%.

Currently, the Propaganda Department of the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Education Bureau have separately selected key factories to deeply summarize experiences in order to promote the further development of worker education throughout the city.

    一定要把职工业余学校办好
    成都市普遍整顿职工业余教育，教学工作有显著进展
    本报讯　成都市普遍整顿职工教育，使各种职工业余学校得到进一步的发展、巩固和提高。现在，全市已有各种职工学校四百八十多所，入学职工从去年年底的八万多人增加到十三万多人，占全市职工总数53％以上。许多大、中型工厂已建立起比较完整的教育体系。最近的调查资料说明：80％以上的学校在教学时间、教材、师资等方面都基本上得到了解决，教学质量也有了提高。
    成都市对职工教育的整顿工作，是去年年底开始的。在整顿中，他们抓住了加强党组织对教育工作的领导，根据党的教育方针改进教学工作，培养、提高和充实教师队伍，妥善安排学习时间等重要环节。去年年底以来，市委宣传部和工业部曾几次召开工厂办学会议，要求各级党组织加强职工教育的具体领导，作到办起一所学校巩固一所学校。各工厂也相继召开党委扩大会，并组织车间一级领导干部深入学习和讨论中央关于教育工作的指示，进一步鼓足搞生产和办教育的积极性。西南无线电器材厂、第一机制砖瓦厂等工厂在党委领导下，成立了领导职工教育的专门机构，并指定一个党委书记、副厂长或党委委员专门负责，统一研究、安排和检查教育工作。成都交通机械厂等工厂还采用层层负责的办法，对各车间提出开展职工教育的具体要求，建立生产、教育同时汇报的制度。这样，各级党组织对职工学校的领导更加深入、具体，职工教育出现了蓬勃的新局面。
    各级党组织根据党的教育方针和本厂具体情况，在整顿工作中，都首先集中力量加强教学工作，提高教学质量。许多工厂在党委领导下，成立了教师、工人、技术人员三结合小组。他们在教学改革中，采取了从生产出发，为生产服务；根据生产发展需要确定技术教育内容，根据技术教育和将来提高的需要，确定文化基础知识教育内容。这样，职工学校教学密切结合了本厂生产实际，兼顾了将来提高的需要。成都量具刃具厂，在组织教学改进小组成员深入车间了解工人需要，发现了过去教学中存在的许多问题，从工人中搜集到改进教学工作的许多具体建议；他们编制出的新教学计划和大纲，就改变了过去内容重复繁琐，脱离生产实际的情况，不仅更加符合本厂需要和成人学习的特点，还增设了政治课，增加了半导体、原子物理学等近代科学成就的知识。
    培养、提高和充实教师队伍，是各工厂、企业党组织在整顿职工教育中非常重视的一项工作。据三十九个工厂统计，已经配备的专职和兼职教师就有一千八百多人。同时，许多工厂还采取了能者为师，继续从本厂职工中挑选兼职教师；挑选具备一定文化程度的老工人，培养为专职教师；组织现有教师参加生产劳动，和政治理论学习，开展教学研究和经验交流活动，组织业务进修。市教育局和东城、西城两区有关部门，也举办了短期师资训练班和业务知识讲座，帮助职工学校教师提高教学能力。在经过这一系列工作后，许多学校教学质量都有较显著的提高。
    除此以外，一般工厂、企业还注意了全面妥善地安排生产和学习时间。许多工厂党组织在布置生产任务时，同时布置学习任务，还统一安排了各种业余活动的时间。这样，不少工厂出现了坚持学习、推动生产的新气象。洪安机器厂七百五十三个职工中，有七百五十二人上了业余学校，由于该厂改善了劳动组织，进行了技术革新，行政干部参加劳动，妥善安排业余时间等四项办法；仅工人们提出并实现的重大技术革新建议就有四十一项，提高工效二至三、四倍，因而在2月份的高产周中，还超额3.7％完成了全厂生产任务。
    目前，中共成都市委宣传部和市教育局分别选择了重点工厂，深入总结经验，以推动全市职工教育的进一步开展。
