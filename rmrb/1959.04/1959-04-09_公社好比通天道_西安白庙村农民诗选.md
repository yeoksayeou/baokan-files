    The east wind fills the garden, the east wind fills the garden with fragrance, the Party points the way for us, the commune is like a road to heaven, communism is paradise, climb the ladder to heaven and look around, paradise is a beautiful sight.

    A dragon returns to the sea, the great river and sea allow turtles to leap, ten thousand miles of clear sky let birds fly, peasants joining the great commune, is like a dragon returning to the sea.
                (Qian Zhongliang)

    Deep roots and lush leaves, the people's commune is a flower, with roots planted deep in the hearts of the members, everyone waters it every day, the roots are deep and the leaves are lush, tall and big.
                (Hu Congmin)
    Step to heaven, the Party leads us up the high mountain, the mountaintop is only a foot and three inches from heaven, this year a step with a body of sweat, next year a step to ascend to heaven.
                (Jin Shengrun)

  Great Strength to Bind a Dragon, a thousand fine hemp threads twisted into rope, the agricultural cooperative has strong roots and fears no wind; ten thousand fine ropes twisted into one, the commune has great strength to bind a dragon.
                  (Mai Liang)
    Carrying Mount Tai without feeling it's heavy, saying that meals are free, happy in our hearts and working hard, carrying Mount Tai without feeling it's heavy, fighting hard for ten years and our hearts are also willing.
                (Hu Haiming)

    公社好比通天道
    ——西安白庙村农民诗选
    东风满园东风满园百花香，党给我们指方向，公社好比通天道，共产主义是天堂，登上天梯四周望，天堂一片好风光。
    苍龙归海大江大海凭龟跃，万里晴空任鸟飞，农民加入大公社，好比苍龙把海归。
                （钱中良）
    根深叶茂人民公社是朵花，社员心里把根扎，人人天天用水浇，根深叶茂高又大。
                （胡聪敏）一步登天党领我们上高山，山顶离天只尺三，今年一步一身汗，明年一步登上天。
                （金生润）
  力大缚苍龙千条细麻拧成绳，农业社树大不怕风；万条细绳拧一股，公社力大缚苍龙。
                  （麦良）挑起泰山不嫌重说声吃饭不要钱，心里高兴干的欢，挑起泰山不嫌重，苦战十年心也甘。
                （胡海明）
