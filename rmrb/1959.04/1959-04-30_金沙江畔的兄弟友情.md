    Brotherly Friendship on the Banks of the Jinsha River
    Lin Yu
    After watching the China Peking Opera Theater's performance of "The Banks of the Jinsha River," I had a strong feeling: this is an artistic creation in which the China Peking Opera Theater has surpassed its previous level. Especially at a time when the people of the whole country are rejoicing over the new life in Tibet, watching this play feels particularly cordial.
    "The Banks of the Jinsha River" is a play with the Long March as its theme. It has many characters, including the Red Army, Tibetans, and Kuomintang reactionaries. Among the Red Army, there are commanders, cadres, and soldiers, etc. It is not easy to portray such characters with distinct personalities, especially in the form of opera. But this performance was a success. Some of the actors in the Peking Opera Theater were not familiar with the roles they played this time, such as Xiao Baiyu Shuang as Jin Xiu, Xi Baokun as Jie Ren Yeba, and Zhao Lianxi as the cook squad leader, but they performed very well. In particular, Zhao Lianxi's portrayal of the squad leader was both humorous and endearing, without damaging the image of this heroic figure in the slightest. Li Zisen's portrayal of the villainous Kuomintang special envoy was also clear in rhythm and distinct in appearance. Wei Rongyuan's portrayal of Wumu, although with few scenes, left a deep impression. The rest of the actors were very competent, performing the Red Army with the spirit of the Red Army, and the chieftains with the status of chieftains. Such a well-matched cast is rare in Peking Opera.
    There was also a certain degree of success in the direction. First of all, it was well done in grasping the theme and highlighting the contradictions. It was able to sharply contrast the two sides of the contradiction. For example, the emphasis on the struggle between two "Yebas" with different political attitudes is one example. At the same time, it was also able to push the contradiction to its climax, creating a strong atmosphere to express the heroic characters. The director is also responsible for the ability of the scene of fetching water to move people. It can also be seen that a lot of thought has been put into adhering to the use of opera techniques to express modern life. Some scenes are quite brilliant, such as the grand scene of robbing Zhuma and the chieftain's appearance, which achieved the point of clear rhythm and rich atmosphere. The use of shooting targets in the bayonet fighting scene can also be reasonable and not forced. But there are still some shortcomings. Some scenes cannot adhere to the use of opera techniques to the end, and some trivial techniques have emerged, such as the opening of the first act, or the rigid insertion of dance methods, such as the party scene, which seems to be able to be modified.
    There are also successful points in the scriptwriting this time. The script is adapted from Comrade Chen Jing's novel of the same name. After standing on the stage, singing, acting, recitation, and acrobatics have all been brought into play, and the characters are relatively distinct, which seems to be richer and more colorful than the original novel. The plot is also relatively compact, and the theme is relatively clear. It is very right for the adapter to put the theme on the point of strengthening unity with fraternal ethnic groups and jointly eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, but some places still retain the theme of narrating the whole family's participation in the revolution, thus appearing lengthy. Another point is that the transformation of Zhuma from a deep misunderstanding of the Red Army to a love for the Red Army is not written clearly enough.
    This is a good play. In all aspects, we have seen the efforts to break through the original level in art, and these efforts have indeed not been in vain, so is the stage art, and so is the music. This ambition to strive for the upper reaches is touching. To create new socialist opera, we must have this spirit. Taking Peking Opera as an example, the foundation is weak, but in recent years, the China Peking Opera Theater has dared to express new themes, striving to be closely related to the struggles of the broad masses of the current, and has performed many plays that seem beyond their ability. There have also been failures, but they have not been discouraged. Today's achievements should be said to be not accidental, but the result of long-term efforts.

    金沙江畔的兄弟友情
    林羽
    看了中国评剧院演出的“金沙江畔”的演出之后，产生一种强烈的直感：这是中国评剧院超过自己以前水平的艺术创造。特别是在全国人民为西藏的新生欢欣鼓舞的时候，看这个戏觉得分外亲切。
    “金沙江畔”是一个以长征为题材的戏，人物众多，有红军、有藏民、有国民党反动派，在红军中间又有指挥员、干部和战士等等，这样一些人物要演得性格突出是并不容易的，何况是用戏曲的形式来演。但这一次的演出却是成功的。评剧院有些演员一向不熟悉这回他演的角色，如小白玉霜扮的金秀，席宝昆扮的捷仁叶巴，赵连喜扮的炊事班长等，但演得却很好。特别是赵连喜扮的班长演得既诙谐可爱，又一点没有损害这个英雄人物的形象。李梓森扮的反派人物国民党特派员也演得节奏清楚外形明确。魏荣元扮的乌木，戏虽不多，给人的印象是深的。其余的演员都很称职，演红军有红军的精神，演土司有土司的身份。这样配搭整齐的一台演员，在评戏是不多见的。
    导演方面也有一定的成功。首先在抓紧主题、突出矛盾这点上做得很好。能够使矛盾的双方尖锐地对立起来。比方强调了两个政治态度不同的“叶巴”之间的斗争就是一例。同时也能将矛盾推到顶点，造成较浓的气氛，来表现英雄人物，取水一场之能感动人，导演也是有功劳的。还可以看出在坚持运用戏曲的手法来表现现代生活上是用了不少脑筋的。有些场子排得相当精采，如抢珠玛和土司出场这一大场戏就做到了节奏鲜明、气氛浓郁这一点。在白刃战一场运用打靶子的程式也能做到合情合理而不勉强。但也还存在一些缺点，有些场面还不能坚持运用戏曲手法到底，出来了一些琐碎的手法，如第一幕开场，或是生硬穿插舞蹈的方法，如联欢会那一场，似乎还可以设法修改一下。
    这次在编剧上也有它的成功之点。剧本是从陈靖同志的同名小说改编过来的。立在舞台上以后，唱、做、念、打都有所发挥，人物也比较鲜明，似乎比原小说内容更显得丰富多采一些。剧情也比较紧凑，主题也比较鲜明。改编者把主题放在和兄弟民族搞好团结共同消灭蒋匪军这一点是很对的，但有些地方还留有叙述全家参加革命的那个主题的东西，因而显得拖沓一些。另一点就是珠玛如何从对红军的深刻误解转变到热爱红军，写得还不够明确。
    这是一个好戏，在各方面都看出了艺术上力图突破原有水平的努力，而这种努力的确没有白费，舞台美术如此，音乐也如此。这种力争上游的志气是令人感动的，创造社会主义的新戏曲就要有这种精神。拿评剧来说，底子薄，但这几年来，中国评剧院敢于表现新的题材，力求与当前广大群众的斗争息息相关，演了许多看来他们力所不及的戏，也曾有过失败，但他们没有气馁，今天的成绩应当说不是偶然得来，而是长期努力的结果。
