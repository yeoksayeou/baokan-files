    High-Yield Field and the Xia Dinghuai Family
    By Our Reporter Li Xiangren
    "The high-yield field cultivated by the couple is like a child they raised, growing strong and lovely!" This reporter recently visited the Huyang People's Commune in Dangtu County, Anhui, and commune cadres and some commune members, while leading me to visit Xia Dinghuai and his wife's wheat high-yield field, praised it in this way.
  Since the production team in this commune launched a campaign this year to strive for a wheat yield of 1,000 catties per mu, Xia Dinghuai, the production team leader, and his wife, Zhang Shuiying, the production group leader, took the lead in cultivating three mu of wheat high-yield fields, setting an example for the entire team. This high-yield field has brought about profound changes in the thoughts, feelings, and family life of the Xia Dinghuai family.
    Xia Dinghuai is impetuous and enthusiastic in his work, but not meticulous, so some commune members call him "wild Zhang Fei." In January of this year, when the wheat seedlings had just emerged, he applied three inches of miscellaneous soil fertilizer to the three mu of high-yield wheat fields in one go, regardless of whether it was good or bad, and without consulting his wife. The wheat seedlings were affected by the excessive pressure. Xia Dinghuai was so anxious that he couldn't sleep well for several nights. However, his wife, Zhang Shuiying, was good at learning from others. She consulted with Old Xu, the commune technician, about this matter, studied ways to solve this problem, and helped Xia Dinghuai dig ditches between the rows of wheat fields with a hoe, moving the miscellaneous soil fertilizer piled on the wheat seedlings into the ditches. This not only did not affect the fertilizer effect but also benefited the growth of the wheat seedlings. At the same time, some quick-acting fertilizer was also applied, and as a result, the wheat seedlings grew vigorously. Usually, Xia Dinghuai rarely listened to his wife's opinions, always feeling that he was a man and knew more than she did. After this lesson, he no longer underestimated his wife. When he led the production team in production, he also strived to be "meticulous in his impetuosity." For example, when applying fertilizer recently, he consulted veteran farmers and mobilized commune members to check the growth of wheat seedlings hill by hill, conduct field consultations, and apply fertilizer according to the seedlings. The commune members said that Xia Dinghuai had changed from "wild Zhang Fei" to "Zhao Zilong."
    Although Zhang Shuiying is a production expert, in the past, she only did what her superiors told her to do, and she was never as proactive as when doing housework. Now, it's not like before. When it rains, she puts down her rice bowl even when she is eating, and runs to the field to see if there is any water accumulation and whether it will affect the wheat seedlings, just like caring for her own children's well-being.
    Xia Dinghuai's father is a master craftsman in the commune's handicrafts industry. He is honest and kind, but he doesn't quite believe in the new production reforms. He believes that the new reforms are "without rules, there can be no standards." When Xia Dinghuai and his wife started cultivating high-yield fields and deeply plowed the land two and a half feet deep, his father always shook his head. When Xia Dinghuai was vigorously applying fertilizer, his father said again: "A white field at Qingming, a field of wheat at Guyu." He advocated applying less fertilizer. Xia Dinghuai's father talked about it several times, and when he saw that his son ignored him, he simply stopped talking. Recently, Xia Dinghuai's father has become talkative again, because he has seen that the wheat cultivated by his son is indeed growing well. He said: "The wheat stalks grow like jade hairpins, now the new method is stronger than the old method."
    "The couple's cultivation of high-yield fields has enabled their whole family to take a step forward." Chen Songbai, the secretary of the commune Party committee, told the reporter excitedly.

    丰产田和夏定怀一家
    本报记者  李祥仁
    “两口子培养的丰产田，像他们抚养的孩子一样，长得壮实可爱！”记者最近在安徽当涂县湖阳人民公社访问，社干部和一些社员，领着我参观夏定怀两口子的小麦丰产田时，这样赞赏着。
  这个公社的生产队长夏定怀和他的妻子、生产组长张水英，自从今年生产队开展力争小麦亩产千斤运动后，他们俩就带头培养了三亩小麦丰产田，在全队树立旗帜。这块丰产田，在夏定怀一家的思想感情和家庭生活上，都引起了深刻的变化。
    夏定怀性情猛，做事有股热劲，但不细心，所以有的社员称他是“猛张飞”。今年元月，小麦刚露苗起身，他不管好坏，也没有征求妻子的意见，一气向三亩小麦丰产田里，施了三寸厚的土杂肥，麦苗因为压力太大，生长受了影响。夏定怀急得直冒火，好几个夜晚，都睡不好。可是他的妻子张水英，善于向别人学习，她把这事先请教公社技术员老徐，研究解决这个难题的办法，帮助夏定怀用锄头在麦田行距中挖沟，把堆在麦苗上的土杂肥拨到沟里，既不影响肥效，又有利麦苗生长，同时又追了一些速效肥，结果麦苗生长茁壮。平常，夏定怀很少倾听妻子的意见，总觉得自己是个男子汉，见识要比她多。经过这次教训，他不再轻视妻子了。他在领导生产队生产时，也力求做到“猛中求细”了。比如最近追肥，他就请教老农和发动社员，先逐丘查麦苗生长情况，进行田头会诊，看苗追肥。社员们说，夏定怀是“猛张飞”变成了“赵子龙”。
    张水英虽是个生产能手，可过去干活只是上级叫干什么，她就做什么，总没有像做家务事那样主动。现在，可不像从前了。下雨了，她即使在吃饭，也丢开饭碗，像关心自己孩子的冷暖一样，跑到田里去看有无积水，对麦苗有没有影响。
    夏定怀的父亲，是公社手工业中的老师傅，为人忠厚，就是不大相信新的生产改革，他认为新的改革，就是“不依规矩不能成方圆。”在夏定怀夫妇开始培养丰产田，深翻土地二尺五时，他父亲总是摇着头。夏定怀在大搞追肥时，他父亲又说：“清明一田白，谷雨一田麦。”主张少追肥。夏定怀父亲几次谈论，看到儿子没有理睬他时，以后他干脆不讲了。最近，夏定怀父亲又健谈了，原因是他看到儿子培养的小麦确实长得好。他说：“麦秆长得像玉簪，如今新法就比老法强。”
    “两口子培养了丰产田，使他们一家人都前进了一步。”这个公社党委书记陈松柏这样兴奋地向记者说着。
