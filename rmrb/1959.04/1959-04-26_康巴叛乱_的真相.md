The Truth About the "Kamba Rebellion"
Zhou Zuyou　Li Desen

In the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama," the fact of the "Kamba Rebellion" is cited in an attempt to prove that the Central People's Government violated the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. However, it is precisely from this event that it is not difficult to see who has been painstakingly undermining the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all ethnic groups since liberation, and who is the real culprit in destroying the Seventeen-Article Agreement.

The so-called "Kamba Rebellion" (Kamba is a Tibetan word referring to the Tibetan area in eastern Kham-Tibet Plateau, Sichuan Ganzi area) was provoked by a small number of reactionary slave owners and feudal lords in this area who coerced some of the masses in order to maintain their dark rule. They burned, killed, robbed, and looted, committing all kinds of evil and seriously endangering the safety of the lives and property of the local Tibetan people. These inhuman insurgents were precisely acting on the orders of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique.

Who commanded the "Kamba Rebellion"?

Many facts now obtained prove that the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique was the commander of this counter-revolutionary rebellion.

In the summer of 1955, when Tibetan traitors Sokang Wangqing Gele and Chijiang Luosang Yexi accompanied the Dalai Lama to attend the National People's Congress and passed through Sichuan on their way back to Tibet, Sokang Wangqing Gele and Chijiang Luosang Yexi split into two groups and instigated and instructed rebellion along the northern and southern parts of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Sokang passed through Kangding, Ganzi, Dege, and other places, while Chijiang went from the southern route through Xiangcheng, Daocheng, Litang, and other places, eventually meeting in Qamdo. According to existing materials, Sokang and others instructed the reactionaries in the above-mentioned areas at that time: "You must unite well internally. There are great contradictions between communist countries and capitalist countries in the world. We must try every means to delay and obstruct democratic reform. If obstruction fails, organize armed rebellion. To rebel, we must establish contact with foreign countries in order to achieve the goal of Tibetan independence." They also demanded that future contact be strengthened, and if there were difficulties, they could provide assistance. After this, rebellions were launched successively in these areas, and the Litang Lama Temple where Chijiang lived and the Ganzi Dajin Temple where Sokang lived became the first temples to launch rebellions and the centers of the rebellion.

After the rebellion was launched in the Litang area, it spread to a considerable part of the Ganzi Autonomous Prefecture. During the rebellion, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique maintained close contact with the Kamba rebels through various means. First, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique constantly sent people to command the rebellion. For example, in 1956, they sent people to participate in the meeting held by the rebel leader in the former southern part of Xikang Province at a Lama Temple in Yidun County, instructing the rebels to persist, to resist comprehensively, to establish a rebel organization, and to unify the name with the Tibetan rebel organization. They said: "You are not isolated, we will definitely support you. You must not surrender even if you die!" They also demanded that the rebels report to the Tibetan local government once a month and send the person most familiar with the situation to Tibet for contact. This meeting studied issues such as unified command and leadership of the rebels, mutual support between the rebels, and strengthening armed rebellion; and passed a letter to the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique. In addition, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique often sent people to instigate rebellion everywhere in the name of lecturing on scriptures. In some places, the rebellion started immediately after the "lecturers" left.

Secondly, the Kamba rebels constantly sent people to Tibet in the name of pilgrimage and business to report the rebellion situation to the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique and receive their instructions. According to Ding Yong Acheng, the head of the rebellion in the original southern part of Kang, the "Commander-in-Chief of the Five Routes Militia," admitted himself, he sent more than a dozen people to Tibet to report and bring back letters and instructions. In one of the letters brought back, the Tibetan traitors instructed them: "Quickly expand the armed forces, foreign countries will provide assistance."

Thirdly, Tibetan traitors often used mule gangs and caravans as cover to transport large quantities of guns, ammunition, and other weapons and materials, smuggling them across the Jinsha River to aid the Kamba rebels. Among the weapons seized by the People's Liberation Army, many were foreign-made.

Finally, the Kamba rebels also transported large amounts of property and personnel to Tibet, which were kept by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique. After the failure of the rebellion, many rebel leaders fled to Tibet, where they were taken in by the Tibetan reactionary clique, rearmed, and allowed to continue various illegal activities.

Through this series of activities, the Kamba rebels maintained close contact with the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, and through this reactionary clique, with imperialism and foreign reactionaries. They had all kinds of pipe dreams and thought they were succeeding, vainly hoping to make the fire of rebellion burn bigger and bigger, to achieve their reactionary goal of "expelling the Han and achieving independence."

The heinous crimes of the rebels

During the rebellion, this small group of Kamba rebels, who did all kinds of evil, roamed around with the support of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, raping, killing, and arson, bringing deep disasters to the Tibetan people east of the Jinsha River and in the eastern part of the Kham-Tibet Plateau. They not only destroyed roads and bridges, besieged government agencies, and killed Tibetan and Han cadres, but even ordinary Tibetan people could not escape their poisonous hands. Under the looting of the rebels, many rich mountain villages became ruins, and many families were broken up, their members killed or scattered.

In order to strengthen their momentum, the rebels did not hesitate to take all kinds of extremely cruel measures to force the masses to participate in the rebellion. Si Langdao Deng, the rebel leader in Baiyu County, in Ronggai Township and other places, in order to coerce the masses to participate in the rebellion, first set fire to the houses of the Tibetan people, robbed their property, and skinned and disemboweled those who resolutely refused to participate, executing them by slow slicing. This group of rebels forced the masses to go up the mountain, stipulating that whoever surrendered would have their entire family shot immediately. More than a hundred old and weak farmers starved to death on the mountain. Some old people who could not walk fast were hanged on the mountain by the rebels. Some who tried to escape and were caught by the rebels were cut into pieces and chopped into minced meat, which was thrown into the wilderness. Some villagers, although they had all fled to the mountains and forests to hide before the rebels arrived, were still not spared from the disaster, their houses were burned down, and their property was looted. When the rebels attacked Pusarong Township in Kangding County, a blind man did not have time to hide, and as a result, his clothes were stripped off, and he froze to death in the wild.

The cruelty of the rebels' methods of killing and harming people is unbelievable. According to statistics from some townships in Xinlong County, as many as 138 people had their eyes gouged out, their noses cut off, and their Achilles tendons severed by the rebels, and 120 people were executed by skinning, heart-cutting, and frying in oil. The reactionaries in Riba Township plucked out the hair of a Tibetan woman one by one, and her head was covered in blood at the time, a truly tragic sight. A rebel leader in Litang Lama Temple did not give food rations to the lamas from working people's families in the temple, trying to starve them to death. When one lama came out to object, the reactionaries cut off his lips, chopped off his hands, and boiled his arms in boiling ghee. The rebels everywhere preached to the people: "Killing a cadre is better than chanting ten thousand volumes of scriptures; killing an activist is like building a pagoda." This is how they used religious pretexts to engage in murder and arson.

Recently, Ganzi County held an exhibition of the evidence of the crimes of the rebels. The evidence exhibited at the meeting was all shocking and infuriating. On display here was a complete human skin, which the rebels in Ganzi County City had peeled from a Tibetan child. People who saw this human skin, which had turned waxy yellow, were filled with grief and indignation. There was also a human heart here, which was also dug out by the rebels themselves. In the home of a rebel, a skull filled with blood was also found. Walking into this exhibition, it is really hard to believe that these actions were done by humans. These bloody events are just bits and pieces of the crimes of the rebels. In this vast highland mountainous area, almost every village, every household, has a blood debt owed by the rebels.

After the rebellion was quelled

The bloody crimes of the Kamba rebels did not frighten the local kind Tibetan people. They rose up to resist one after another, cooperated with the heroic People's Liberation Army, and completely quelled the rebellion in a short period of time, and began to rebuild their happy homes.

Now, democratic reform has been successfully completed here. The broad masses of poor Tibetan people have been distributed land, houses, cattle and sheep, and some areas have realized cooperation and established the first batch of people's communes. Last year, grain production in the agricultural areas of the entire prefecture achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a general increase of 30%-40%, and some counties increased by as much as double. In the areas that were previously occupied by the rebels, the people have begun to live a life of plenty.

    “康巴叛乱”的真相
    周祖佑　李德森
    在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中，举出了“康巴叛乱”这一事实，企图证明中央人民政府违背关于和平解放西藏的十七条协议。但是，恰好从这一事件中，人们不难看出，解放以来，谁在处心积虑地破坏着祖国的统一和各族人民的团结，谁是破坏十七条协议的真正的罪魁祸首？
    所谓“康巴叛乱”（康巴是藏语，指康藏高原东部、四川甘孜一带藏族地区）是这个地区的少数反动的奴隶主、封建主为了保持他们黑暗的统治，而胁迫部分群众挑起的。他们烧、杀、抢、掠，无所不为，严重地危害了当地藏族人民生命财产的安全。而这些灭绝人性的叛乱分子，正是听命于西藏上层反动集团的。
    “康巴叛乱”的指挥者是谁？
    现在已经获得的许多事实证明，西藏上层反动集团，就是这次反革命叛乱的指挥者。
    1955年夏天，西藏叛国分子索康·旺清格勒、赤江·罗桑益西等随达赖喇嘛出席全国人民代表大会完毕返藏道经四川时，索康·旺清格勒和赤江·罗桑益西即分两路在甘孜藏族自治州北南两部，沿途煽动和指使叛乱。索康经康定、甘孜、德格等地，赤江从南路经乡城、稻城、理塘等地，最后在昌都会合。根据现有材料证实，当时索康等曾对上述地区反动分子指示说：“你们内部要好好团结，世界上共产党和资本主义国家有很大矛盾，我们要想尽一切办法拖延和阻挠民主改革。阻挠不成，就组织武装叛乱。要叛乱，必须与外国取得联系，才能达到藏族独立的目的。”他们并且要求今后加强联系，如果有困难，他们可以给予帮助。在这以后，这些地区就先后发起叛乱，而赤江住过的理塘喇嘛寺和索康住过的甘孜大金寺，都成为首先发起叛乱的寺庙和叛乱的中心。
    叛乱在理塘地区发动后，曾经蔓延到甘孜自治州内相当一部分地区。叛乱期间，西藏上层反动集团与康巴叛乱分子通过各种方式，一直保持着密切联系。首先，西藏上层反动集团不断派人前来指挥叛乱。如1956年，他们就派人参加原西康南部地区叛乱匪首在义敦县喇嘛寺举行的会议，指使叛匪坚持下去，全面反抗，成立叛乱组织，并与西藏叛乱组织统一名称。他们说：“你们不是孤立的，我们一定支持你们。你们死也不能投降！”他们还要求叛匪每月向西藏地方政府汇报一次，并派最熟悉情况的人进藏联系。这次会议研究了叛匪统一指挥、统一领导、叛匪间相互支援、以及加强武装叛乱等问题；并通过了给西藏上层反动集团的一封信。此外，西藏上层反动集团还经常以讲经说法为名，派人到处煽动叛乱。有些地方“讲经者”一走，叛乱就立即开始。
    其次，康巴叛乱分子不断假借朝佛、经商名义，派人进藏向西藏上层反动集团汇报叛乱情况，接受他们的指示。仅据原康南地区叛乱头目、“五路民团总指挥”定雍阿称自己供认，就先后派十来人进藏汇报，带回信件、指示。在有一次带回的信件中，西藏叛国分子指示他们：“迅速扩大武装力量，外国将有帮助”。
    第三，西藏叛国分子经常以骡帮、商队作掩护，运来大批枪支、弹药等武器、物资，偷渡金沙江，援助康巴叛乱分子。在人民解放军缴获的武器中，还有不少是外国制造的。
    最后，康巴叛乱分子还把财产、人员等大批运往西藏，交西藏上层反动集团保管。叛乱失败后，许多叛乱头目纷纷向西藏逃跑，西藏反动集团将他们收留起来，重新加以武装，让他们继续进行各种非法活动。
    通过这一系列活动，康巴叛乱分子与西藏上层反动集团，并经由这个反动集团与帝国主义和外国反动派，保持着密切联系。他们做着各种美梦，自以为得计，妄想把叛乱的火越烧越大，达到他们“驱汉独立”的反动目的。
    叛乱分子的滔天罪行
    叛乱期间，这一小撮无恶不作的康巴叛乱分子，在西藏上层反动集团的支持下，到处流窜，奸淫烧杀，给金沙江以东、康藏高原东部的藏族人民带来了深重的灾难。他们不仅破坏道路桥梁，包围机关，杀害藏、汉族干部，就是普通的藏族人民也逃不脱他们的毒手。在叛乱分子劫掠下，不少富饶的山村变成了废墟，许多人家破人亡，流离失所。
    叛乱分子为了壮大声势，不惜采取一切极端残酷的手段，强迫群众参加叛乱。白玉县的叛首四郎刀登，在绒盖乡等地，为了威逼群众参加叛乱，首先放火烧毁了藏民的房舍，劫走了财物，把坚决不愿参加的人剥皮、挖心，一刀一刀的凌迟处死。这群叛乱分子把群众威逼上山以后，规定谁投降立即枪杀全家。有一百多个年老体弱的农民活活在山上饿死。有些老人走不快，就被叛乱分子吊死在山上。有的逃跑不遂，被叛乱分子捉回来切成碎块、砍为肉泥，抛在野外。有些村庄的农民，在叛乱分子来到前，虽都跑到山林里躲藏起来，仍然不能幸免于难，房屋被烧光，财物被抢光。叛乱分子袭击康定县菩萨绒乡时，一个瞎子没有来得及躲掉，结果衣服被剥得精光，冻死在野外。
    叛乱分子杀人害人的手段，其残酷程度令人难以置信，据新龙县部分乡的统计，被叛乱分子挖眼睛、割鼻子、抽脚筋的就有一百三十八人之多，用剥皮、割心、下油锅等刑法处死的有一百二十人。日巴乡的反动分子，把一个藏族妇女的头发一根根地拔光，当时满头鲜血，惨不忍睹。理塘喇嘛寺一个叛乱头子，对寺庙劳动人民出身的喇嘛不发口粮，企图活活饿死他们。一个喇嘛出来反对，反动分子便割去他的嘴唇、砍掉他的双手，还把他的手臂放在滚开的酥油里煮。叛乱分子到处对人宣传说：“杀死一个干部，胜念万卷经；打死一个积极分子，如修一座经塔。”他们就是这样，打着宗教幌子来大搞杀人放火的勾当。
    最近，甘孜县举行了一次叛乱分子的罪证展览会，会上展出的罪证，无不惊心怵目，令人发指。这里展出了一张完整的人皮，是甘孜县城区的叛乱分子从一个藏族小孩身上剥下来的，人们看见这张已经变成蜡黄色的人皮，都悲愤欲绝。这里还有一颗人心，也是叛乱分子亲手挖出来的。在一个叛乱分子家里，还搜出了盛满鲜血的头骨。走进这个展览会，人们真是很难相信这些行为是人干出来的。这些血迹斑斑的事件，只是叛乱分子罪行的点点滴滴，在这片辽阔的高原山区，几乎每一个村庄，每一户人家，都有叛乱分子欠下的一笔血债。
    叛乱平息以后
    康巴叛乱分子的血腥罪行，并没有吓倒当地善良的藏族人民。他们纷纷起来反抗，配合英勇的人民解放军，在短期内就彻底平息了叛乱，开始重建幸福的家园。
    现在，民主改革已经在这里胜利完成。广大的贫苦藏族人民分得了土地、房屋和牛羊，有的地区实现了合作化并建立了第一批人民公社。去年，全州农业区粮食生产获得空前丰收，普遍增产30％—40％，有的县增产达一倍。在过去被叛乱分子盘据的地区，人民都开始过着丰衣足食的生活。
