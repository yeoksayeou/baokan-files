Combining Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Using Both Chinese and Western Drugs
Ningdu County Basically Eliminates Five Diseases

(Our dispatch) Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved great success in carrying out pest elimination and disease eradication work in conjunction with production.

Starting in December 1958, Ningdu County, with production as the center, organized a pest elimination and disease eradication campaign with disease eradication as the key focus, concentrating all its efforts on eliminating filariasis, hookworm disease, malaria, tinea capitis, and venereal diseases, and controlling leprosy throughout the county. Currently, among the patients with the "Five Diseases" identified throughout the county, over 95% have been cured, with the exception of a very few whose treatment is still actively underway due to special circumstances. People suffering from leprosy have also been properly isolated and resettled.

The reason why Ningdu County has achieved such great success in pest elimination and disease eradication work is mainly due to strengthening the Party's leadership and mobilizing the masses. In the pest elimination and disease eradication campaign, from the county committee to the branch, command organizations were established at all levels to be specifically responsible for leading the work of pest elimination and disease eradication. In order to combine production and pest elimination and disease eradication, the Party organizations at all levels in Ningdu County, according to the characteristics of different stages of the movement, integrated cleaning with manure accumulation, eliminating rats and sparrows with protecting grain, and preventing and treating diseases with improving work efficiency; they carried out small-scale campaigns during busy farming seasons and large-scale campaigns during slack farming seasons. Disease examinations and treatments were conducted as much as possible from the perspective of benefiting production and facilitating the masses, using time before and after meals, during evening breaks, and during meetings, or setting up application and proxy application treatment boxes at the entrance of canteens, or organizing collective applications. Medical and technical personnel made door-to-door visits to deliver medicine, delivering medicine to the fields, to water conservancy and iron and steel construction sites. At the same time, the county also established more than forty temporary hospitals to facilitate treatment for the masses.

In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient medical and technical personnel, Ningdu County adopted the method of decentralizing technology, handing over technology to the masses, teaching, learning, and doing at the same time. They trained more than 3,100 intermediate and primary prevention and treatment technical personnel with high school and primary school education levels among the masses. Now, more than 85% of them have been trained to be able to independently master technical operations, and the correct diagnosis rate has reached 83% to 97%. Through these intermediate and primary prevention and treatment technical personnel using the method of apprenticeship, they have also passed on the technology they have learned to the broad masses, forming a huge mass medical technology force. As a result, the examination stage, which was originally considered the most difficult to break through in the work of disease eradication, basically completed the blood film and stool sample delivery and examination work and the application treatment work for malaria, tinea capitis, leprosy, and venereal diseases in just fifteen days, greatly accelerating the progress of disease eradication work.

After the large-scale pest elimination and disease eradication work was launched in Ningdu County, they also correctly implemented the policy of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, using both indigenous and foreign methods, launching a vigorous technical revolution, and overcoming difficulties such as drug shortages and insufficient medical equipment. They mobilized all the urban and rural traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and herbalists, vigorously carried out apprenticeship and folk medicine collection activities, and collected more than 1,700 secret prescriptions and folk remedies for treating various diseases, some of which have already achieved good results in practical applications. When carrying out prevention and treatment work, special emphasis was placed on combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, using both Chinese and Western drugs, giving play to the active role of Western medicine and Western drugs, and also giving play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine, folk experts, and Chinese herbal remedies. As a result, it saved state expenditures, accelerated the speed of pest elimination and disease eradication, and reduced the economic burden on the masses, which the masses were very satisfied with. For example, in the treatment of parasitic diseases, the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and the use of both Chinese and Western drugs shortened the course of treatment and improved the curative effect.

    中西医结合　中西药并用
    宁都县基本上消灭五病
    本报讯　江西宁都县结合生产进行除害灭病工作，取得很大成绩。
    宁都县从1958年12月开始，以生产为中心，组织了一场以灭病为重点的除害灭病运动，集中全力在全县范围内消灭丝虫病、钩虫病、疟疾、头癣、性病五病和控制痳疯。目前全县已经查出的“五病”患者，除极少数因为特殊情况还正在积极进行治疗以外，其余95％以上的病人都已经痊愈；对患了痳疯病的人，也妥善地进行了隔离和安置。
    宁都县除害灭病工作所以获得这样大的成绩，主要是加强党的领导，发动群众的结果。在除害灭病运动中，从县委到支部，层层都建立了指挥机构，专门负责领导除害灭病工作。为了使生产和除害灭病相结合，宁都县各级党组织根据运动不同阶段的特点，做到打扫卫生与积肥相结合，消灭鼠雀与保护粮食相结合，防治疾病与提高工效相结合；农忙小搞，农闲大搞。检查、治疗疾病，都尽量从有利于生产、便利群众出发，利用饭前、饭后、晚上休息、开会时间，或在食堂门口设立申请和代申请治疗箱，或组织集体申请。医务技术人员，做到送药上门，送药到田间，到水利和钢铁工地。同时全县还设立了四十多个临时医院，以便利群众治疗。
    为了解决医务技术力量不足的困难，宁都县采取了技术下放的办法，把技术交给群众，边教、边学、边做。他们在群众中培养了具有高小和初小文化水平的中、初级防治技术人员三千一百多名，现在85％以上都锻炼得能单独掌握技术操作，正确诊断率达到了83％到97％。通过这些中、初级防治技术人员运用带徒弟的方式，又把所学到的技术交给广大群众，形成了一支庞大的群众医疗技术队伍。于是原来认为灭病工作最难突破的检查一关，仅十五天的时间，就基本上完成了血片、大便的送查工作和疟疾、头癣、痳疯、性病的申请治疗工作，大大加速了灭病工作的进展。
    宁都县在大规模的除害灭病工作展开以后，还正确地贯彻了中西医结合、土洋并举的方针，大闹技术革命，克服了药品缺乏、医疗器械不足等困难。他们把城乡的中医中药人员全部调动起来，大力开展拜师采风运动，共收集到治疗各种疾病的秘方、土方一千七百多个，有的在实际应用中已经收到了很好的疗效。进行防治工作时，特别强调中西医结合，中西药并用，既发挥西医西药的积极作用，也发挥中医、土专家、中药土方的作用。结果，节省了国家开支，加快了除害灭病的速度，减轻了群众经济负担，群众很满意。如治疗寄生虫病，采用中、西医合治，中、西药并用治疗，就缩短了疗程，提高了疗效。
