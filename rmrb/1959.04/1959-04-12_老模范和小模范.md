In February, Wang Yulian had just attended the Yinchaun City Communist Youth League Members' Representative Conference. In March, Wang Yuzhen attended the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Midwives and Obstetricians Representative Conference. The Hui and Han commune members of the Gaotaishi Management Area of the Honghua People's Commune in Yinchuan City praised them as one being a "young model" and the other an "old model."

Yuzhen is a 56-year-old Hui woman, and Yulian is an 18-year-old Han girl. They are both midwives at the obstetrics and gynecology hospital. After the village established the People's Commune last September, Yuzhen took on the midwifery work in the obstetrics and gynecology hospital of a commune management area. She is a skilled practitioner of modern midwifery. Soon, the commune transferred Yulian to be her assistant. From then on, they became close comrades-in-arms.

Before coming to the hospital, Yulian had only studied modern midwifery for a few days and lacked experience. Yuzhen patiently helped her. Shortly after Yulian came to the maternity hospital, a pregnant woman was sent in. This pregnant woman's first birth was a difficult one, and Yulian was very worried when delivering her baby, and she was hesitant to act. At that time, Yuzhen stood next to her, encouraging her to be bold in her operations and providing specific guidance. Finally, the pregnant woman gave birth to the baby smoothly. In order to help Yulian improve faster, Yuzhen would first examine the pregnant women during routine check-ups, and then let Yulian examine them. Afterwards, they would compare the results of the two examinations, pointing out any inaccuracies. With Yuzhen's continuous help, Yulian quickly mastered the technique and can now independently and accurately perform prenatal examinations on pregnant women and skillfully perform deliveries.

Yuzhen and Yulian also care for each other in life. Yulian is young, enthusiastic, hardworking, and a skilled laborer. Seeing that Yuzhen is older, she always does more of the heavy work herself. In her spare time, she also reads the newspaper and sings to Yuzhen.

　　老模范和小模范
    2月，王玉莲刚参加了银川市共青团员代表大会。3月，王玉珍又出席了宁夏回族自治区保育员、接生员代表会议。银川市红花人民公社高台寺管理区的回汉族社员夸她们一个是“小模范”，一个是“老模范”。
    玉珍是个五十六岁的回族老太太，玉莲是个十八岁的汉族姑娘。她们都是妇产院的接生员。去年9月村上成立人民公社后，玉珍就在公社一个管理区的妇产院里担任了接生工作。她是一个新法接生能手，不久，社里又调玉莲来做她的帮手，从此，她们两个就成了亲密的战友。
    玉莲来院前只学习了几天新法接生，缺少经验。玉珍就耐心帮助她，玉莲来产院不久，就送来一个产妇，这个产妇头胎是难产，玉莲给她接生时，十分担心，一时不敢动手。当时，玉珍就站在她旁边，一面鼓励她大胆操作，一边进行具体指导。终于使这个产妇顺利地生下了婴儿。为了帮助玉莲更快进步，平时检查孕妇时，玉珍就先检查一遍，再让玉莲检查，然后对照两人检查的结果。指出哪些地方不准确，在玉珍的不断帮助下，玉莲很快掌握了技术，现在已能单独准确地给孕妇作产前检查，熟练地进行接生了。
    玉珍和玉莲在生活上也互相关心体贴。玉莲年轻热情，脚勤手快，是个劳动能手，她看到玉珍年岁大，总是自己多干些重活。空闲时，她还给玉珍读报、唱歌。
