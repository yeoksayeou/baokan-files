Mother's Heart
    To the Editor:
    With an excited heart and tearful eyes, I am writing this letter to you.
    There are seven siblings in my family. I am the eldest and currently studying in a secondary specialized school. The youngest brother is still in kindergarten. The other siblings are all in high school, junior high school, and elementary school. Two years ago, my beloved mother passed away, and my father also left us for work in Xi'an. I also live at school.
    People who see our family shake their heads and sigh, thinking that this group of children is unattended. However, in reality, my younger siblings receive the same care as if they had relatives, and they live happily.
    The care from the neighborhood residents' committee, the police station, and the neighbors is too numerous to mention. Even the salesperson at the department store outside the alley asks with concern when they hear that one of my younger brothers or sisters is sick.
    My eldest and second sisters are both studying at Beijing Dongcheng District No. 11 Girls' Middle School. Since our mother passed away, my eldest sister was very sad, didn't want to study, and didn't like to talk. But under the guidance and encouragement of Director Diao in their school, she is now doing well in her studies, is happy, and also serves as the class president. Director Diao and the class teachers of my eldest and second sisters not only care for them in every possible way but also show meticulous care for the other younger siblings. Knowing that most of my sisters eat in the school cafeteria, and only my second and third brothers who are in elementary school have to cook at home, Director Diao took the trouble to find a cafeteria for them, and finally they joined the neighborhood children's cafeteria. During the New Year, thinking that my younger brothers and sisters would be lonely at home with no one to play with, she asked my eldest sister to take them to school to play and bought them sweets.
    Recently, my second brother contracted scarlet fever, an acute infectious disease. When she found out, she told my eldest sister to take good care of her brother at home and help him catch up on his studies later. She also sent anti-inflammatory pills for the siblings to take to prevent infection.
    My youngest third brother is in the Wang Zhima Hutong No. 1 Kindergarten in Dongcheng District. The aunties and nurses there treat him even better than relatives.
    Once, my third brother contracted an infectious disease and needed to be isolated. The nurse cared for him until late at night. My third brother cried and wanted to go home. The nurse kept holding him and coaxing him.
    Recently, because my second brother had scarlet fever, we couldn't pick up my third brother on Sunday, so the auntie took him to her own home.
    Although we have lost our mother and our father is far away from us, there are many "relatives" around us who are even closer than our parents. We deeply feel that there is kinship everywhere in the motherland.
    Besides thanking them, we can only repay all the relatives who take care of us and love us, and repay the great Party and Chairman Mao, as my little third brother said, "Study hard and build socialism."

Everything for the Patient
    To the Editor:
    The spirit of the staff of the Chengdu First People's Hospital, who do everything possible to serve patients, is very touching.
    My mother, Gao Zhongqi, suffered from cervical cancer in 1954 and was cured after treatment at the Peking Union Medical College. In October last year, her left leg suddenly became swollen. After being diagnosed at the Tumor Hospital, it was found that the cervical cancer had recurred and metastasized to her leg. However, there was no cure, and she could only live for a few months at most. At that time, the National Pharmaceutical and Health Exhibition was being held in Beijing. I went to visit it and saw the deeds of Dr. Zhang Chengan of the Chengdu First People's Hospital, who used traditional Chinese medicine to cure such patients. I was extremely happy and told Comrade Wang Guifu (a nurse at the Chengdu First People's Hospital), who was working as an explainer at the exhibition, about my mother's condition. This young girl was very sympathetic to me and quickly wrote a letter to Dr. Zhang Chengan, asking him to treat my mother.
    However, my mother's condition developed very quickly, and we couldn't wait for the hospital to send the prescription. We decided to send my mother to Chengdu for hospitalization. But a problem arose. Several of my siblings have jobs, and none of us could accompany her to the hospital. Moreover, we didn't have any relatives or friends in Chengdu. Given such a serious condition, would the hospital accept her? But if we didn't send her, there was no other way. In the end, my younger brother sent her to Chengdu. After contacting the hospital in Chengdu, she was quickly admitted. Under the excellent diagnosis and treatment of Dr. Zhang Chengan, my mother's condition stopped deteriorating after taking six or seven doses of traditional Chinese medicine. At this time, my younger brother returned to Beijing due to work, and the hospital fully took responsibility for her treatment and care. Dr. Zhang painstakingly studied her condition and prescribed the right medicine. Her condition gradually improved. The hospital also took very good care of my mother. The hospital office wrote to me and said, "Don't worry, we will take care of her as well as if she were living at home." Indeed, they came up with many ways to take good care of the patient. For example, according to the northern habit of eating noodles, they made noodles for my mother every noon. Fearing that she would be lonely, a doctor surnamed Chen even brought his beloved radio from home to the hospital for my mother to listen to operas. Comrade Wang Guifu also often took time to visit her in the ward, comforting her not to miss home. In her letter to me, she said, "Don't worry about anything, we will treat her as if she were our own mother. I will prepare everything she needs..." My heart was very excited after reading these letters.
    Three months passed. After the careful treatment and care of the doctors and nurses, my mother was finally rescued from the brink of death. The swelling in her legs and abdomen had basically disappeared, and she could walk freely. After the Spring Festival, she wanted to come home to see us, and the doctor allowed it. The hospital specially sent someone to the train station to buy a sleeper ticket. On the day she boarded the train, Comrade Wang Guifu represented the hospital and escorted my mother to the train. I think the communist style of treating patients by all the doctors and nurses in the Chengdu First People's Hospital is worthy of praise.

### 祖国处处有亲人

    祖国处处有亲人
    母亲的心肠编辑同志：
    我怀着激动的心情，含着眼泪给您写这封信。
    我家中有兄弟姊妹七人，我最大，现在中等专业学校上学，最小的弟弟还在幼儿园。别的弟妹也都各在高中、初中、小学念书。二年前，亲爱的母亲去世了，父亲因为工作需要也离开我们到了西安。我又住在学校里。
    别人看到我们这个家都会摇头叹息，认为这一群孩子无人照管。但是，实际上我的弟弟妹妹却得到和亲人一样的照顾，他们生活得很愉快。
    街道居民委员会、派出所和邻居的照顾，真是举不胜举，就连胡同口外百货店的售货员知道了哪一个弟弟或妹妹病了也要关怀地问问。
    大妹和二妹都在北京东城区女十一中上学，大妹自从母亲去世后，非常伤心，不想念书，不爱说话，可是在她们学校刁主任的劝导和鼓励下，她现在功课很好，喜笑颜开，还在班上担任了班主席工作。刁主任和大妹、二妹班上的班主任，不但对大妹、二妹关怀备至，就是对其他的弟弟妹妹也是关怀得无微不至。刁主任知道我们姊妹多半在学校食堂吃饭，只有二弟三妹上小学还得在家做饭吃时，就不辞劳苦为他俩找食堂，最后在街道儿童食堂入了伙。过新年时，她想到小弟弟妹妹在家没人陪着玩，就叫大妹妹带到学校里去玩，并给弟弟妹妹买了糖果。
    最近二弟得了急性传染病——猩红热。她知道了，就嘱咐大妹在家好好照顾弟弟，功课以后帮助补上，又送来消炎片，要弟妹们吃，防止传染。
    我最小的三弟在东城区汪芝麻胡同第一幼儿园，那里的阿姨和护士对待他比亲人还亲。
    有一次，三弟得了传染病，需要隔离，护士阿姨一直照顾他到深夜。三弟哭着要回家。护士阿姨一直抱着他，哄着他。
    最近由于二弟得猩红热，星期日不能接三弟回家，阿姨就把他带到自己家里去了。
    我们虽然失去了母亲，父亲又远离我们。但是我们周围有许多“亲人”比父母亲还亲。祖国处处是亲人，我们深深地感受到了。
    我们除了感谢他们以外，就只有如小三弟说的：“好好学本领，建设社会主义”，来报答一切照顾我们、抚爱我们的亲人，报答伟大的党和毛主席。

    一切为了病人编辑同志：
    成都市第一人民医院工作人员千方百计为病人服务的精神十分令人感动。
    我母亲高仲琪，1954年患子宫颈癌，经中国协和医学院治疗痊愈。去年10月间，她的左腿突然浮肿，后经肿瘤医院诊断是子宫颈癌复发转移到腿上了，但已无药可治，最多也只能活几个月了。当时全国医药卫生展览会正在北京展览，我去参观了一下，看到成都市第一人民医院张澄庵老大夫用中药医治好了这种病人的事迹，我高兴极了，把母亲的病状告诉了在展览会上作讲解员的王桂馥同志（成都市第一人民医院的护士），这位年青的姑娘非常同情我，并且很快地写信给张澄庵老大夫，请求他老人家给我母亲治疗。
    但是，母亲的病情发展得很快，不能等医院来信给寄药方，我们决定把母亲送到成都去住院治疗。可是问题来了，我们兄弟姐妹几人都有工作，谁也不可能陪她住院，而成都又没有我们一个亲戚朋友，像这么严重的病情，医院能收吗？可是不送又没有其它办法，最后还是由我弟弟送她到成都去了，到成都后，经过和医院接洽，很快就被接收入院。母亲的病情在张澄庵大夫卓越的诊断治疗下，服了六、七付中药后已停止恶化，这时，我弟弟因工作关系就回京了，由医院里完全担负起治疗和照顾她的责任。张老大夫费尽苦心研究她的病情，对症下药，病情逐渐好转。医院里对我母亲的照顾也很周到，医院办公室给我来信说：“你放心吧，我们会照顾她像生活在家里一样周到。”真的，他们为了照顾好病人，想了许多办法，比如按照北方人爱吃面食的习惯，每天中午给母亲作面条吃，怕她寂寞，一个姓陈的医生还把自己心爱的收音机从家里拿到医院让我母亲听戏。王桂馥同志也经常抽空到病房去看她，安慰她不要想家，她在给我的来信中说：“一切都放心吧，我们会把她老人家当作自己的母亲一样看待，她需要什么我都会给她准备的……”读到这些信后，我的心情真是非常激动。
    三个月过去了，经过医生、护士们的精心治疗和护理，终于把母亲从死亡的边缘上挽救了回来，腿肿腹肿已基本消失，可以随意行走了，春节后她想回家来看看，医生许可了，医院专门派人到火车站买卧铺票，上火车那天，王桂馥同志代表医院一直把我母亲送到车上。我认为成都市第一人民医院全体医生护士们这种对待病人的共产主义风格值得表扬。北京东城区妇联　苑文华（附图片）
