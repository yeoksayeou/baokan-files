    Wheat Lodging Can Be Prevented
    Sichuan's Millions of Laborers Fight Bravely Against Wind and Rain to Achieve Lodging Prevention Victory
    Shaanxi Takes Measures Based on Observation of Seedlings, Land, and Weather to Ensure Normal Wheat Growth
    (Our Chengdu dispatch, April 8th) The millions of laborers in Sichuan Province are fighting day and night in the fields and against the continuous wind and rain to rescue lodged wheat. The achievements made in the past few days show that lodging can be completely overcome. On April 1st, the province held a province-wide broadcast mobilization meeting on preventing and rescuing wheat lodging, exchanged experiences in preventing and supporting lodged wheat, and called on all regions to make persistent efforts, persevere to the end, and earnestly achieve "preventing lodging where there is no lodging, supporting lodged wheat where there is lodging, and supporting while lodging," to ensure that every wheat plant is upright and every seedling is strong, ensuring a bumper harvest.
    Most of Sichuan Province's 23 million mu of wheat are currently heading and flowering, growing well and promising a good harvest. However, since March 26th, they have been continuously attacked by strong winds and heavy rain, causing some wheat to lodge. After discovering the lodging phenomenon, Party committees at all levels immediately organized the masses to rescue the wheat, and the broad masses of commune members responded to the call and rushed to the scene. On March 26th, more than 2 million people in the Mianyang Special District went out in the rain to rescue lodged wheat and strengthen the prevention of potentially lodged wheat. In three days, the district raised 70% of the lodged wheat. In Anyue County, 300,000 people, led by the First Secretary himself, worked hard for two days and nights to restore the lodged wheat to its upright position. Cadres and the masses in Suining, Jiangbei, Pengshui, and other counties displayed a spirit of perseverance. Some wheat was raised and then lodged again, and raised again after lodging, finally making them stand upright.
    While vigorously rescuing lodged wheat, all regions have further strengthened lodging prevention work and regarded this work as the central task of current wheat field management. In the Fuling Special District, people's communes have universally established specialized wheat lodging prevention teams, with each county designated a secretary to be responsible for leadership, implementing zoned responsibility to the end. A heat wave of wheat field management in the later stage, where each block is preventing lodging and each grain is ensuring a bumper harvest, is now sweeping the district. People's communes in Wenjiang, Dayi, and other counties have widely held mobile on-site meetings to exchange experiences in preventing lodging in a timely manner and guide commune members to fight against lodging. Huayang, Jiangjin, and other places have greatly produced lodging prevention elements. This lodging prevention element is made of a certain proportion of bone meal, phosphate rock powder, fertilizer salt, superphosphate, etc., and the effect is very good. In Huayang County, more than 1,800 mu of high-yield fields in the Victory People's Commune have universally applied lodging prevention elements, and have not experienced lodging despite continuous wind and rain attacks.
    Sichuan Province's agricultural leadership departments have promoted to the entire province the effective experiences of supporting and preventing lodging in the later stage of wheat in various regions: (1) Lift up the lodged wheat row by row, build a grid-like frame with bamboo, and then insert bamboo with forked branches and branches between rows and nests, so that the wheat stalks can be supported on the bamboo frame or these branches. (2) After raising the lodged wheat, tie it up with rice straw or palm leaves like a triangle, generally tying 60 to 70 ears into a bundle. When bundling the wheat, it should be tied upright and not too tightly, otherwise it will affect normal grouting and maturation. (3) In areas lacking scaffolding or binding materials, the method of cultivating soil to consolidate the roots can be used. One person raises the lodged wheat, and the other person cultivates the soil at the roots until the wheat stands upright. Using this method can also increase soluble nutrients for the wheat, which can strengthen the grains. (4) In places where there is a lack of scaffolding materials or labor for cultivating soil, a layered loosening method can be used. After the wheat lodges, immediately use a bamboo pole to gently loosen the wheat in layers, removing moisture and reducing the weight of the pressure, so as to promote more wheat ears to rise after being exposed to the sun for a few days, increasing the pollination and setting rate.
    (Our Xi'an dispatch, April 8th) Shaanxi is taking various measures to prevent wheat lodging while fiercely attacking the wheat jointing stage. On April 2nd, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry convened units such as the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences to study the current problem of wheat lodging prevention. Based on the current wheat growth in various regions and the lodging prevention experiments conducted in various regions, various lodging prevention methods for different wheat fields were proposed. On the evening of April 3rd, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry held another telephone conference to deploy the work of strengthening lodging prevention.
    At present, except for the mountainous areas, the wheat in the entire province is in the jointing stage. In the Hanzhong Basin, wheat seedlings are nearly two feet high, and in the Guanzhong Plain, wheat seedlings are generally more than five inches high. Most of the wheat fields in the province are growing normally, with thick stalks and large leaves. Due to recent wind and rain, a small number of wheat fields have lodging phenomena. In order to further do a good job in lodging prevention, the meeting proposed: For wheat fields in mountainous areas that are regreening or just beginning to joint, we should continue to carry out suppression, harrowing, and soil cultivation, and apply more grass ash and phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to make the wheat roots well-established and the basal nodes strong; for wheat fields that have already jointed and have taken the above measures during the regreening stage, it is required to appropriately control irrigation during the jointing stage based on the recent heavy rainfall or watering during the regreening stage, appropriately increase the application of grass ash and phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, prevent excessive growth, conduct seedling squatting, and make the wheat stems thick and hard; for the very few individual wheat fields that have already jointed and have signs of excessive growth or lodging, it is required to appropriately prune leaves, thin seedlings, and other methods to solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission, and carry out soil cultivation, apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, appropriately control irrigation, and build scaffolding and windbreaks to make the wheat stems strong. According to the survey of more than 30 high-yield fields in Xingping by the Institute of Soil Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, even wheat seedlings that have lodged in wind and rain, as long as the masses are mobilized to observe the seedlings, land, and weather, and measures such as pruning leaves, thinning seedlings, cultivating soil, and building scaffolding are taken, the wheat will quickly return to normal growth.
    Shaanxi Province also researched and exchanged the experiences of various regions in lodging prevention at the wheat regreening on-site meeting held in early March. Weinan County also convened a meeting of old farmers and model workers to discuss the experience of lodging prevention. Production teams of various communes have also summarized and promoted the past experience of lodging prevention. According to the analysis of various regions: The situation and reasons for wheat lodging in Shaanxi are that one is root lodging, which is caused by the secondary roots not being deep and unstable; the other is stem lodging, which is caused by the wheat stalks being thin and soft and the stem walls being thin and brittle. This year's situation is that on the one hand, after deep plowing of the land, the base fertilizer is sufficient, and the wheat roots are well-developed, deep and stable, increasing the lodging resistance; on the other hand, this year, due to dense planting and increased water and fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer is sufficient, and the wheat leaves are lush and dense, affecting ventilation, and the weather is relatively warm, making the wheat prone to excessive growth. In summarizing past experiences and in response to the new situation of wheat production this year, in the battle of regreening, measures such as suppression, harrowing, soil cultivation, application of more grass ash and phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, early watering of regreening water, and late watering of jointing water were generally adopted. In this way, the soil is closely combined with the wheat tillering nodes, the soil layer in the root base is thick, which is convenient for the growth of secondary roots, and the potassium and phosphorus fertilizer required for the wheat to grow long stalks is sufficient. Generally, the basal nodes are very strong, which provides a guarantee for preventing root lodging and also creates conditions for preventing stem lodging.
    At present, in the jointing stage, soil is being cultivated for a large area of wheat, and grass ash and phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are being applied to the wheat fields with different situations such as the current soil water content, and late watering of jointing water or less watering and more watering are adopted to make the wheat stems strong; some are also building scaffolding, pulling nets, and setting up windbreaks for small areas of wheat fields; some are also using pulling the dew drops on the wheat leaves to reduce the pressure of rainwater on the wheat leaves, and placing soil blocks in the wheat seedlings that are merged and squeezed together to facilitate wheat ventilation and light transmission. Various regions are also collecting and manufacturing a large amount of grass ash and phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to ensure the needs of wheat stem growth, etc.
    (Our Zhengzhou dispatch, April 8th) The people's communes in Yanshi County, Henan Province, paid early attention to cultivating strong stalks and roots, etc., based on the characteristics of this year's wheat stalks being high, leaves being dense, leaves being wide and thick, and heads being heavy, in order to fundamentally prevent wheat lodging.
    Yanshi County planted 460,000 mu of wheat this year. According to a recent survey, the first-class wheat accounts for 300,000 mu, with an average of more than 1.5 million plants per mu; the second-class wheat accounts for 130,000 mu, with an average of about 1 million plants per mu; the third-class wheat seedlings have more than 15,000 mu, with an average of more than 400,000 plants per mu. The number of seedlings in this year's wheat fields is three to four times higher than last year. The increase in the number of plants is, of course, a reliable guarantee for a greater bumper harvest of wheat this year, but also because after dense planting of wheat, there are many plants and leaves, the leaves are wide and thick, and they are mutually closed, hindering ventilation and light transmission, and the stems are weak, increasing the possibility of lodging.
    Based on these characteristics of wheat growth this year, Yanshi County made arrangements for lodging prevention work early. Combining with other wheat field management work, they established more than 1,700 professional teams, with a special committee member responsible for each management area, and each professional team also established a professional research group. During the regreening period, the county paid attention to watering the regreening water early and watering the jointing water late, and also made small ridges and shallow watering. At the same time, different fertilizers were applied according to different wheat seedlings. The first-class wheat seedlings have many heads, thick leaves, and wide leaves, and a lot of base fertilizer is applied. For this type, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are mainly applied to promote strong wheat stalks.
    Combined with fertilization, cultivate soil for wheat roots and shorten the bottom nodes. The soil is one-third of rotten compost, one-third of strong soil, and one-third of cinder. The benefit is that in addition to the cinder itself containing phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to strengthen the stalks, it can also loosen the soil and infiltrate water. In the county's good wheat, 240,000 mu have been universally cultivated once, and 50,000 mu of wheat have been cultivated two to three times.
    In order to promote the close connection between wheat roots and tillering nodes and the topsoil, strengthen the stem support capacity, and inhibit the growth of the main stem to prevent lodging, the county carried out suppression work before the wheat jointing, suppressing 390,000 mu of wheat. The wheat seedlings after suppression are strong and the plants are low. (Note: After the wheat jointing, it is no longer possible to suppress it.)
    In addition to fundamentally taking measures to strengthen stalks, cultivate roots, and prevent lodging, Yanshi County is taking emergency measures for wheat seedlings that have lodged due to continuous cloudy and rainy weather: pruning one-third of the leaves to reduce weight and prevent excessive growth, or removing ineffective tillers to facilitate ventilation and light transmission. There are also more than 400 mu in the county that have set up lodging prevention shelves.
    Now, the county has concentrated its efforts to open phosphate mines, collect grass ash, and purchase a batch of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers from other places. It is planned to apply it to wheat fields to promote stronger wheat stalks and prevent wheat lodging at any time. (Zhang Lizhong) (Attached picture)

    小麦倒伏可以防止
    四川千百万劳动大军猛战风雨取得防倒伏胜利
    陕西看苗看地看天采取措施确保小麦正常生长
    本报成都8日电　四川省各地千百万劳动大军，为抢救小麦倒伏，正日夜在田间和连绵的风雨搏斗。几天来取得的战果说明，倒伏完全可以战胜。4月1日，全省召开了防止和抢救小麦倒伏广播动员大会，交流了各地防倒、扶倒的经验，要求各地再接再厉，坚持到底，切实做到“无倒防倒、有倒扶倒、边倒边扶”，定要小麦株株直立、苗苗健壮，确保大丰收。
    四川省两千三百万亩小麦，大部分正在抽穗扬花，长得好，丰收在望。但是，从3月26日以来，连续遭到大风大雨袭击，部分小麦倒伏。各地党委在发现倒伏现象后，立即组织群众抢救，广大社员一呼百应，纷纷赶到现场。3月26日，绵阳专区各县二百多万人冒雨出动，抢救倒伏小麦和加强可能倒伏小麦的预防工作。全区在三天中，即将70％倒伏的小麦扶起。安岳县出动三十万大军，由第一书记亲自带领，经过两昼夜的苦战，使倒伏的小麦重新直立。遂宁、江北、彭水等县干部和群众发挥了坚韧不拔的精神，有些小麦扶起又倒，倒了又扶，终于使它们直立起来。
    各地在大力抢救倒伏小麦的同时，都进一步加强了防倒工作，并把这一工作作为当前小麦田间管理的中心任务。涪陵专区各人民公社普遍建立了小麦防倒伏专业队，各县指定由一个书记负责领导，实行划片包干，一包到底。现在全区掀起了一个块块防倒伏、粒粒保丰收的小麦后期田间管理热潮。温江、大邑等县人民公社广泛召开了流动现场会，及时交流防止倒伏经验，指导社员和倒伏作斗争。华阳、江津等地大造防倒素，这种防倒素是用一定比例的骨粉、磷矿粉、肥料盐、过磷酸钙等混合制成的，效果很好。华阳县胜利人民公社一千八百多亩高产田普遍施用了防倒素后，连续遭受风雨袭击，都没有发生倒伏。
    四川省农业领导部门向全省推广各地行之有效的小麦后期扶倒、防倒的经验：（一）将倒伏的小麦一行一行地理起来，用竹子搭成方格的架子，再在行间、窝间插上带丫枝的竹子和树枝，让麦秆扶在竹架上或这些枝条上。（二）把倒伏的小麦扶起来后，用谷草或棕叶把它像三角架似的捆起来，一般以六、七十穗捆成一捆为宜，在捆麦时，要捆得端正，不能过紧，否则影响正常灌浆成熟。（三）在缺乏搭架或捆扎材料地区，可采用培土固根的办法。由一人将倒伏的小麦扶起，另一人在根部培土，待小麦直立为止。采用这个办法，还能给小麦增加可溶性养分，能够壮子。（四）在搭架缺材料、培土缺乏劳力的地方，可用分层挑松的办法，在小麦倒伏后，立即用竹竿轻轻将小麦分层挑松，去掉水分，减轻压抑的重量，以促使较多的麦穗在太阳晒过几天后，能够翘起来，增加授粉结实率。
    本报西安8日电　陕西在猛攻小麦拔节关中，采取各种措施防止小麦倒伏。4月2日陕西省农林厅召集中国农业科学研究院陕西分院等单位研究了当前小麦的防倒伏问题。根据目前各地小麦生长情况以及各地所作过的防倒伏试验，提出不同麦田的各种防倒伏办法。4月3日晚，农林厅又召开电话会议，布置了加强防倒伏的工作。
    现在，全省除山区外，小麦都在拔节，汉中盆地麦苗已近二尺高，关中平川一般麦苗也在五寸以上，全省麦田绝大部分生长正常，秆粗叶大。由于近日连遭风吹雨打，小部分麦田有倒伏现象。为了进一步作好防倒伏工作，会议提出：山区正在返青或才开始拔节的麦田，应该继续进行镇压耙耱和培土，多施草木灰和磷钾肥料，使小麦根子扎好，基节粗壮；对已经拔节而且在返青关中曾采取过上述措施的麦田，要求根据最近雨量较多或浇过返青水的情况，适当控制浇拔节水，适当增施草木灰和磷钾肥料，防止陡长，进行蹲苗，使小麦茎秆粗硬；对于极少数个别的麦田，已经拔节而有陡长或有倒伏迹象的，则要求适当剪叶、疏苗等办法，解决通风透光问题，并进行培土，施磷钾肥，适当控制灌溉，搭架和设风障，使小麦茎秆粗壮。根据中国科学院地壤研究所在兴平调查的三十多块高产田证明，即使在风雨中倒伏的麦苗，只要经过发动群众看苗，看地，看天气，采取了剪叶、疏苗、培土、搭架等措施，都很快使小麦恢复了正常生长。
    陕西省还在3月初召开的小麦返青现场会议上，就研究交流了各地防倒伏的经验。渭南县还召集了老农及劳动模范开会，座谈了防倒伏的经验。各公社生产队也都总结和推广了过去防倒伏的经验。根据各地分析：陕西小麦倒伏的情况和原因是，一种是根部倒伏，这是由于次生根扎的不深不稳而引起的；另一种是因麦秆细软、茎壁薄脆，而引起的茎倒伏。今年的情况是一方面经过土地深翻，底肥足，麦根发育很好，扎的深而稳，增加了抗倒伏能力；另一方面，今年由于密植及水肥增加，氮肥充足，麦叶丰茂密闭，影响通风，加以天气较暖，小麦容易陡长。各地在总结过去经验和针对今年小麦生产新情况，在大战返青关时一般都采用了镇压耙耱、培土、多施草木灰及磷钾肥、早浇返青水迟浇拔节水等措施。这样，土壤与小麦分蘖节密切结合，根基部分土层厚，便于次生根生长，小麦长秆所需钾磷肥充分，一般基节都很粗壮，就为防止根倒伏提供了保证，也为防止茎倒伏创造了条件。
    目前，各地在拔节关中，正给大面积的小麦进行培土，增施草木灰和磷钾肥料，对当前土壤水量较多等不同情况的麦田采用晚浇拔节水或少浇多浇，使小麦茎秆粗壮；有的还给小面积的麦田搭架拉网设风障；有的还用拉麦叶上的露水珠减轻麦叶上雨水压力，把麦株并垄和挤在一起的麦苗中放土块便利小麦通风透光。各地还正在收集、制造大量的草木灰和磷钾肥料，以保证小麦生长茎秆等的需要。
    本报郑州8日电　河南偃师县各人民公社根据今年小麦秆高、叶密、叶宽厚、头沉的特点，及早注意了培育壮秆、壮根等工作，从根本上防止小麦倒伏。
    偃师县今年种四十六万亩小麦，据最近调查，一类麦占三十万亩，每亩平均株数一百五十多万株；二类麦十三万亩，每亩平均一百万株左右；三类麦苗有一万五千多亩，平均每亩株数四十多万株。今年的麦田苗数，比去年增加三、四倍。株数增多，固然是小麦今年更大丰收的可靠保障，但也因为小麦密植后，株多叶多，叶宽叶厚，互相郁闭，妨碍通风透光，茎秆细弱，增加了倒伏的可能。
    偃师县根据今年小麦生长的这些特点，及早地对防倒伏的工作作了安排。他们结合其他各项麦田管理工作，建立了一千七百多个专业队，每个管理区有专门委员负责，每个专业队还建立了专业研究小组。这个县在返青期间，就注意了早浇返青水，晚浇拔节水，并作到小畦浅浇。同时，根据不同麦苗，进行了不同的施肥，一类麦苗头多叶厚叶宽，施的底肥多，对这一类麦着重追入磷、钾肥料，促使麦秆粗壮。
    结合施肥，为麦根培土，缩短底节。培的土是三分之一腐熟堆肥，三分之一壮土，三分之一煤渣，好处是除了煤渣本身含磷钾肥壮秆外，还能松土渗水。全县的好麦，有二十四万亩普遍培土一次，还有五万亩麦培了二次到三次。
    为了促使麦根和分蘖节与表土密接，加强支持茎秆能力，抑制主秆生长，以防倒伏，全县在小麦拔节前开展了镇压工作，镇压了三十九万亩小麦。镇压后的麦苗粗壮植株低。（按：在小麦拔节以后，就不可再镇压了。）
    除了从根本上采取措施壮秆培根防倒伏外，偃师县正对由于连日阴雨而倒伏的麦苗采取紧急措施：剪三分之一的叶子，减轻重量，防止陡长，或者去掉无效分蘖以利通风透光。全县还有四百多亩搭起防倒伏的架子。
    现在，这个县已集中力量，开磷矿，收集草木灰，从外地购来一批磷钾肥料。准备施入麦田促进麦秆更加粗壮，防止小麦任何时期的倒伏。　（张励中）（附图片）
