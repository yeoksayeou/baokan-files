Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 19th: Over seven hundred people from all walks of life in Hanoi held a grand rally at the Hanoi Grand Theater on the evening of the 18th to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference and "African Freedom Day," and to welcome the Algerian military delegation.

Premier Pham Van Dong, along with Vice Premiers Truong Chinh, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Phan Ke Toai, as well as representatives from the National Assembly, Fatherland Front, and various political parties and people's organizations, attended the meeting.

When the Algerian military delegation, coming from the front lines of the anti-colonial struggle, entered the venue, the hall erupted in a storm of sustained applause.

Hoang Minh Giam, Minister of Culture of Vietnam and Deputy Head of the Vietnamese delegation attending the Bandung Conference in 1955, and Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Secretary-General of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, spoke at the meeting. They both emphasized the continuous victories achieved by the Bandung spirit over the past four years and expressed support for the struggle of the Algerian people. Hoang Minh Giam said that the Vietnamese people regard the victories of Asian and African countries as their own. The government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely support the struggle of the Asian and African people for national independence, especially the heroic struggle of the fraternal Algerian people.

Omar Oussedik, head of the Algerian military delegation, said in his speech that the Algerian people's anti-colonial struggle is a just struggle and will surely achieve victory. He also wished that the militant friendship between the Vietnamese and Algerian people would be increasingly consolidated and developed.

The meeting concluded with the adoption of a resolution expressing the advocacy for further strengthening the unity, friendship, and cooperative relations among the people of Asian and African countries; further developing the anti-colonial struggle; and further launching the struggle against US imperialism's interference in South Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 18th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, stating that in recent years, the Bandung spirit has been continuously promoted and has played a significant role in strengthening relations between countries with different social and political systems, as well as in promoting national liberation movements. Holding "African Freedom Day" and "Algeria Day" while commemorating the Bandung Conference is precisely to promote the Bandung spirit and further expand the unity of all nations against colonialism and imperialism.

The editorial listed major events that have occurred in Asia and Africa in the past four years and pointed out: "These events prove that the nations of Asia and Africa are increasingly becoming a new force, together with the socialist forces, in promoting the collapse of imperialism." No force can prevent the Asian and African people from resolutely realizing the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Council calls on the Asian and African people and the people of the world to unite, strengthen their common struggle, give imperialism a final blow, and establish lasting peace.

The editorial said that US imperialism is trying its best to invade Africa. They are conspiring to intensify interference in Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam. The United States is importing atomic weapons into Taiwan and South Korea and is establishing missile bases in the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan. However, in the current situation where "the East wind prevails over the West wind," no imperialism can pull back the historical wheel of national liberation in Asia and Africa.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 18th: The Albanian "People's Voice" said today in a commentary commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference: In the past four years, great changes have taken place in the lives of the Asian and African people. The resolutions of the Bandung Conference dealt a heavy blow to the colonialists and encouraged the rising struggle of the Asian and African people for freedom.

However, the commentary pointed out that the imperialists have not abandoned their aggressive plans. British and French colonialists continue to ignite the flames of aggression in Africa, and the rising colonialist, the United States, is also trying to establish its own colonial rule. To achieve this goal, it uses the Tito revisionist clique.

The commentary said that when Tito visited Asian and African countries, he carried the banner of "active coexistence" and boasted that he was a friend of the people of these countries. But in reality, Tito tried his best to create divisions between Asian and African countries, to lead them away from the path of peace and neutrality, and ultimately to undermine the national liberation movements of these two continents. As an imperialist mouthpiece, Tito would certainly not say that the real danger threatening the Asian and African people comes from imperialist aggressors. On the contrary, he constantly uttered inflammatory words against the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, and openly supported the counter-revolutionaries in Iraq and Tibet. The commentary said that the Yugoslav revisionists have once again revealed their true colors – skilled agents of imperialism.

　　河内集会纪念万隆会议四周年
　　热烈欢迎阿尔及利亚军事代表团
    新华社河内19日电　河内各界七百多人18日晚上在河内大戏院隆重集会，纪念万隆会议四周年和“非洲自由日”，并且欢迎阿尔及利亚军事代表团。
    范文同总理和长征、武元甲、潘继遂三位副总理，国会、祖国战线和各政党、人民团体的代表出席了大会。
    当来自反殖民主义斗争前线的阿尔及利亚军事代表团进入会场时，会场响起了暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。
    越南文化部部长、在1955年出席万隆会议的越南代表团副团长黄明鉴和越南亚非人民团结委员会秘书长阮春水在大会上讲了话。他们都强调万隆精神四年来不断取得的胜利，并且表示支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。黄明鉴说，越南人民把亚非各国的胜利当作自己的胜利。越南民主共和国政府和人民坚决支持亚非人民争取民族独立的斗争，特别是兄弟般的阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争。
    阿尔及利亚军事代表团团长奥马尔·乌西迪克在会上讲话时说，阿尔及利亚人民反殖民主义的斗争是正义的斗争，它必将取得胜利。他并且祝越阿人民的战斗友谊日益巩固和发展。
    大会最后通过决议，表示主张进一步加强亚非各国人民的团结友谊和合作关系；进一步开展反殖民主义的斗争和进一步展开反对美帝国主义干涉南越的斗争。
    新华社河内18日电　越南“人民报”今天为纪念万隆会议四周年发表社论说，几年来，万隆精神不断得到发扬，并在加强社会和政治制度互不相同的国家之间的关系，以及推动民族解放运动等方面起了重大的作用，在纪念万隆会议的时候，举行“非洲自由日”和“阿尔及利亚日”正是为了发扬万隆精神和进一步扩大各民族反殖民主义和反帝国主义的团结力量。
    社论列举了亚洲、非洲四年来发生的重大事件之后指出：“这些事件证明，亚非各民族今天正在日益成为同社会主义力量一起促使帝国主义垮台的新生力量。”任何力量也阻挠不了亚非人民坚决要实现亚非人民团结理事会的号召。亚非人民团结理事会号召亚非人民和世界人民团结起来，加强他们的共同斗争，给于帝国主义以最后的打击和建立持久和平。
    社论说，美帝国主义正在竭力侵入非洲。它们正在阴谋加强干涉柬埔寨、老挝和南越。美国正在把原子武器输入台湾和南朝鲜，并在菲律宾、泰国、巴基斯坦建立导弹基地。可是，在目前“东风压倒西风”的形势下，任何帝国主义也不能把亚非各国民族解放的历史巨轮拉向倒退。
    新华社地拉那18日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”今天在一篇纪念万隆会议四周年的评论中说：在过去的四年里，亚非人民的生活发生了巨大的变化。万隆会议的决议沉重地打击了殖民主义者，并鼓舞了正在高涨的亚非人民争取自由的斗争。
    但是，评论指出，帝国主义并没有放弃他们的侵略计划，英、法殖民主义者在非洲继续点燃侵略的火焰，而后起的殖民主义者——美国也正在力图建立起自己的殖民主义统治。为了达到这一目的，它使用了铁托修正主义集团。
    评论说，铁托在访问亚非国家时打着“积极共处”的旗帜，大吹大擂地宣称他是这些国家人民的朋友。但实际上，铁托竭力企图造成亚非国家之间的分裂，使亚非国家离开和平和中立的道路，最后破坏这两大洲的民族解放运动。作为帝国主义传声筒的铁托当然不会说出威胁亚非人民的真正危险是来自帝国主义侵略者的。相反，他不断地放出煽动性的言辞以反对苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家，公开地支持伊拉克和西藏的反革命叛乱。评论说，南斯拉夫修正主义者又一次显露出他们的真正面目——帝国主义的熟练的代理人。
