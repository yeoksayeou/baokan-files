Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 17th:

The Indian Communist Party's organ, the "New Age" weekly, recently published a special article criticizing the so-called "independent Tibet" slogan put forward by some people in India and the fallacy of calling the Tibetan rebellion a "national uprising."

The article said that those who put forward these claims are not "helping the cause of the Tibetan people who urgently need progress to catch up with the rest of the world, nor are they helping the cause of peace and security in the region based on Sino-Indian friendship. If an "independent" Tibet is established, dominated by imperialist-backed reactionaries, there can be no peace and security for India and China."

When explaining the truth about the Tibetan rebellion, the newspaper pointed out that "After the Second World War, both Britain and the United States recognized that Tibet was part of China, but as soon as India was liberated from British rule and China was liberated from the Chiang Kai-shek clique and its American patrons, the imperialists changed their tune, and the United States began to prepare to recognize Tibet as an "independent country" and made all preparations to apply for Tibet to join the United Nations. After the start of the Korean War, the US Seventh Fleet protected Chiang Kai-shek in the Taiwan Strait. The US imperialists hoped to take Vietnam from French control. In these conspiracies, they hoped to maintain control over Tibet in order to use it as a base for invading mainland China."

The weekly said that this also explains "how the Tibetan rebels were able to obtain such modern weapons for use in their soon-to-fail rebellion." Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters in Taipei has announced that it is air-dropping supplies to the Tibetan rebels. The newspaper said: "We all know that Chiang Kai-shek exists by the grace of US imperialism, so it is not difficult to understand where these weapons he is air-dropping are coming from."

The weekly pointed out that a rebellion carried out with Chiang Kai-shek's weapons cannot be a national uprising; it can only be a rebellion by a minority against the state. It said, "If more arguments are needed, one only needs to look at the undisguised joy expressed by the imperialist newspapers about the Tibetan events."

The newspaper analyzed China's agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, pointing out how the Chinese government respected this agreement and respected Tibet's autonomy. It said that the Chinese government even "did not take a single step to implement reforms or reorganize the Tibetan army." It also said, "Allowing a minority nationality to have its own army, and even though there was a clear agreement that this army would be incorporated into the central army, this has not yet been done because the local reactionaries are unwilling to carry out this reform. I ask, which country would tolerate this situation?" It said, "The Chinese central authorities not only did not urge the Tibetan local government to implement reforms, but also guaranteed that reforms would not be implemented before 1962."

The newspaper pointed out, "Thus, it is not difficult to see who instigated the rebellion—it was a rebellion organized by a minority." It said, "They took out the weapons they had collected and distributed them."

The newspaper said, "We hear that this is a national uprising in Tibet. This is not the first time we have heard of a national uprising; it is through this method that we gained our freedom. But if our landlords now organize to resist land reform, and someone tells us that this is a national uprising, then we will say: Stop talking nonsense."

It said that the situation in Tibet is also the same. The Masani and Mehta gang say that "Tibet has been raped." They hope to support a small group of privileged upper-class Tibetan reactionaries to maintain their privileges in an outdated social system, especially that they want to do everything possible to undermine the friendly relations between India and China, and their main task seems to be to lead India step by step into the embrace of imperialism.

### 印度“新世纪”周报载文  批判关于西藏叛乱事件的谬论  指出歪曲真相的人是想破坏印中友好关系

　　印度“新世纪”周报载文
　　批判关于西藏叛乱事件的谬论
　　指出歪曲真相的人是想破坏印中友好关系
    新华社新德里17日电　印度共产党机关报“新世纪”周报最近一期刊载的一篇特稿，批判了在印度有人提出的所谓“独立的西藏”的口号以及把西藏叛乱事件说成是“民族起义”的谬论。
    文章说，提出这些说法的人并不是“在帮助迫切需要进步以便赶上世界其他地区的西藏人民的事业，也不是在帮助这个地区的以印中友好为基础的和平与安全的事业。如果建立一个由帝国主义支持的反动派在其中飞扬跋扈的“独立的”西藏，那么印度和中国就不可能有和平和安全。”
    这家报纸在说明西藏叛乱事件的真相时指出，“在第二次世界大战以后，英国和美国都承认西藏是中国的一部分，但是一等到印度从英国人的统治下以及中国从蒋介石集团和它的美国庇护人的统治下获得解放以后，帝国主义者就改变了他们的腔调，而美国开始准备承认西藏是一个“独立国家”，并且作好一切准备以便提出关于西藏加入联合国的申请。朝鲜战争开始以后，美国第七舰队在台湾海峡保护蒋介石，美帝国主义者希望把越南从法国人的控制下拿过来，在这些阴谋活动中，他们希望继续保持对西藏的控制，以便把它用来作为进侵中国的大陆基地。”。
    这家周报说，这也说明，“西藏的叛乱分子怎么会得到在他们很快就失败的叛乱中使用的那样现代化的武器。”在台北的蒋介石总部已经宣布对西藏叛乱分子进行空投。报纸说：“我们全都知道，蒋介石是靠美帝国主义的恩典存在的，因此不难了解，他正在空投的这些武器是从那里来的。”
    这家周报指出，用蒋介石的武器进行的叛乱，不可能是民族起义，它只能是少数人反对国家的叛乱。它说，“如果还需要更多的论据的话，人们只要看一看帝国主义报纸对西藏事件所表示的毫不掩饰的高兴就可以知道了。”
    这家报纸分析了中国关于和平解放西藏的协议，指出中国政府怎样尊重这个协议和尊重西藏的自治。它说，中国政府甚至“并没有采取一个步骤去实行改革或者改组西藏军队。”它还说，“允许一个少数民族有它自己的军队，而且尽管有着关于这支军队将并入中央的军队这种明确的协议，但是由于当地反动派还不愿意进行这种改革而尚未这样做。试问哪一个国家会容忍这种情况？”它说，“中国的中央当局不仅没有催促西藏地方政府实行改革，反而保证在1962年以前不实行改革。”
    这家报纸指出，“这样，不难看出，这是谁搞的叛乱——这是少数人组织的叛乱。”它说，“他们拿出了他们收集的武器，并且分发这些武器。”
    这家报纸说，“我们听说，这是西藏的民族起义。我们并不是初次听到民族起义的说法；我们就是通过这种办法获得自由的。但是，如果我们的大地主现在组织起来抗拒土地改革，而有人对我们说，这是民族起义，那我们就要说：别胡说了。”
    它说，西藏的情况也是如此。马萨尼和梅达这帮人说什么“西藏遭到了强奸”，他们希望支持一小撮西藏的既得利益上层反动分子来保持他们在一个过时的社会制度中的特权，特别是他们要竭力破坏印度同中国的友好关系，而他们的主要任务看来是要使印度一步一步地投入帝国主义的怀抱中去。
