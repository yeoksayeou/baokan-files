　　A Joyful Song After Inspection
　　Lǐ Jìshēn
　　I participated in inspections of eight places in the suburbs of Beijing, and happily composed songs. I have three poems and five ci, which I use as reports.

    Haidian District Work-Study School
　　Human nature is originally similar, but mostly changes with material desires.
　　Spoiled by families, old habits secretly break away.
　　The reform policy is correct, work and study are both suitable.
　　Living and working have discipline, actions are in accordance with regulations.
　　Learning mood is cheerful, labor is happy and not tired.
　　Naughty children become good students, decay turns into magic.
　　The success of management and education is huge, thanks to patient teachers.
　　I hope to gain experience and contribute to resources in all directions.

    Fourth Office of the Jiaodaokou Neighborhood Committee
　　The system is truly superior, and the people celebrate the daily renewal.
　　Children are all cared for, and the old and weak are taken care of.
　　The streets are clean, and the doorsteps are spotless.
　　Mosquitoes and flies have no place to live, and rats and birds are completely submerged.
　　Books are neatly bound, clothes are washed diligently.
　　Illiteracy is completely eliminated, and industry is starting from scratch.
　　Men and women have equal resources, and husbands and wives respect each other like guests.
　　Everyone is well-placed, and good governance is seen in every household.

    Ivory Art Factory
　　Ivory carving is known at home and abroad, innovating and creating new things.
　　Mountains and rivers are beautiful together, and figures are the most vivid.
　　A few inches show thousands of miles, and a round ball has twenty-nine layers.
　　A hundred flowers bloom brilliantly, and all things contain joy together.
　　The giant dragon of the East leaps, and the heroic formation of the Red Square is arrayed.
　　Heavenly craftsmanship imparts skills, and labor is refined.
　　Art strives for harmony, no matter north or south.
　　Exquisite craftsmanship celebrates the grand festival, and the motherland is happy and long-lived.

    Partridge Sky
    Thirteen Tombs People's Commune
    Happily see the People's Commune established, red flags are planted all over the Thirteen Tombs.
　　New trees in the mountain corners are full of spring, and fresh scales in the reservoir are happy and clear.
　　Spring buds and summer hangs pendants, green apples and red persimmons are full of cars.
　　Luxuriant crops are full of plains, and fruits are planted for longevity and increased production.

    Capital Municipal Planning and Tiananmen Construction Site
　　The prosperity of the capital is by no means accidental, and industrial and agricultural production is taken into consideration.
　　Ten years of reconstruction have turned into a new look, and how much management has created a great spectacle.
　　The project is fast, unprecedented, and the towering structure of Lianyun stands in Tiananmen.
　　The magnificent and splendid new metropolis, the world is amazed and looks at it with new eyes.

    Chemical Factory
　　Chemical functions are ingenious and clever, and all kinds of benefits require research.
　　Five-color film adds color, and thousands of filaments connect electricity.
　　Abundant plastic, rich material source, strive hard and cleverly to strive forward.
　　Four thousand varieties are listed in the workshop, and the welfare of the people is seen in a big way.

    Synthetic Fiber Factory
　　The new nylon is first-class, and the surplus products of mining and agriculture are worth searching for.
　　No need to cut down sheep or touch sheep, but also see the flying brocade umbrella.
　　Together we make nets and admire the fish swimming, the fiber is thin and tough, better than silk.
　　The two phases strive to reach a thousand tons of production, and the competition red flag is even stronger.

    Electron Tube Factory
　　The construction of the factory is huge and difficult, and selfless assistance relies on the Soviet Union.
　　Large and medium-sized tubes are airlifted, and long and short waves start telecommunications.
　　The slender hands are clever in every way, arranging semiconductors completely.
　　We will wait for the tenth anniversary of the National Day, and the whole world will hear the broadcast.

　　视察喜咏
　　李济深
　　余参加京郊视察凡八处，欣然成咏，得诗三首，词五阕，借作报道。
    海淀区工读学校
　　人性原相近，多随物欲移，家庭娇养惯，旧染潜支离。
　　改造方针确，工读两相宜，兴居有纪律，行动洽规仪。
　　学习心情畅，劳工乐不疲，顽童成好学，腐朽变神奇。
　　管教成功巨，耐心好老师，愿将经验得，裨作八方资。
    交道口居民委员会第四办事处
　　制度真优越，人民庆日新，孩提皆有托，老弱得安身。
　　街道多清洁，门庭绝点尘，蚊蝇无噍类，鼠雀委沦湮。
　　书籍装订整，衣裳洗涤勤，文盲都扫净，工业起椎轮。
　　男女资平等，夫妻敬若宾，大家齐得所，善政见闾閪。
    象牙艺术工厂
　　牙刻闻中外，推陈更出新，山川同毓丽，人物最传神。
　　尺幅几千里，圆球廿九层，百花齐放艳，万象共含欣。
    东土巨龙跃，红场雄阵陈，天工输技巧，劳动见斯文。
　　艺术争谐作，奚论南北分，精工祝盛典，祖国乐长春。
    鹧鸪天
    十三陵人民公社
    乐睹人民公社成，红旗插遍十三陵，山陬新树饶春色，水库鲜鳞乐泚清。春茁蕊，夏垂璎，青苹红柿载车盈。离离庄稼平畴满，果播长生丰产增。
    首都市政规划和天安门建设工地
    京国繁荣岂偶然，工农生产顾周全，十年改建翻新样，几许经营蔚大观。工程速，世无前，连云崇构峙天安。辉煌壮丽新都会，万国惊奇刮目看。
    化工厂
    化学功能巧夺天，万般有裨费钻研，五光胶卷增颜色，千缕灯丝接电缘。丰塑料，裕材源，苦思巧干力争前。四千品种车间列，福利人群见大端。
    合成纤维厂
    新制尼龙第一流，矿农余品耐寻搜，不烦剪伐羝羊触，还看飞腾锦伞收。同结网，羡鱼游，纤维细轫胜丝绸。两期争达千吨产，竞赛红旗劲更遒。
    电子管厂
    建厂工程巨且艰，无私援助仗苏联，大中型管资空运，长短周波启电传。廉纤手，巧千般，安排半导体完全。会待十周年国庆，举世齐闻广播宣。
