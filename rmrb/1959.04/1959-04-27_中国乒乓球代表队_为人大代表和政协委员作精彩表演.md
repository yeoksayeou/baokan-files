Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: The Chinese Table Tennis Team, which participated in the 25th World Table Tennis Championships, held a report performance tonight in the competition hall of the Beijing Gymnasium to entertain the deputies attending the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the members attending the First Session of the 3rd National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    Premier Zhou Enlai, National People's Congress Deputy, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Panchen Erdeni, and Deputy Chairman and Secretary-General Ape A-wang Jinmei, and others, attended the performance tonight.

    The performance by young world men's singles champion Rong Guotuan against the famous "defender" Jiang Yongning aroused great interest among the audience. In the performance, Rong Guotuan's smashes went sometimes left, sometimes right, sometimes light, sometimes heavy, making Jiang Yongning run around passively. However, Jiang Yongning, in his steady chop defense, often combined it with sudden smashes, also posing a great threat to Rong Guotuan. As a result, Rong Guotuan won the first game 21-18, and Jiang Yongning won the second game 21-17.

    The audience also saw the men's singles performance by Zhuang Zedong and Chen Xiezhong, rising stars of the Chinese Youth Table Tennis Team. Seventeen-year-old Zhuang Zedong adopted a style of fierce smashing and hitting, defeating Chen Xiezhong, the sixth place winner in the national men's singles last year, who is nineteen years old, by 21-9 and 22-20.

    A total of eight performances were held tonight, lasting two and a half hours. Among them were women's singles of attack versus defense, and men's singles of attack versus attack; there were mixed doubles of straight grip versus shakehand grip players, and men's doubles of attack versus defense. Each performance only played two games, and each performance won enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    中国乒乓球代表队
    为人大代表和政协委员作精彩表演
    新华社26日讯　参加第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛的中国乒乓球代表队，今晚在北京体育馆的比赛馆中举行了汇报表演，招待参加第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的代表们和参加中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议的委员们。
    周恩来总理，全国人民代表大会代表、西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼和副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美等人，都出席观看了今晚的表演。
    年轻的世界男子单打冠军容国团对著名的“守将”姜永宁的表演，引起了观众极大兴趣。容国团在表演中扣球忽左忽右、忽轻忽重，使姜永宁左右奔跑处于被动，但姜永宁在稳健的削球防守中还经常配合以突然的猛扣，也给容国团很大威胁。结果第一局容国团以二十一比十八胜，第二局姜永宁以二十一比十七胜。
    观众今晚还看到了中国青年乒乓球队的后起之秀——庄则栋和陈协中两人的男子单打表演。十七岁的庄则栋采取猛抽猛扣的打法，以二十一比九和二十二比二十战胜了去年的全国男子单打第六名、十九岁的陈协中。
    今晚共举行了八场表演，共历时两个半钟头。其中有攻对守的女子单打，也有攻对攻的
  男子单打；有直握拍对横握拍选手们的男女混合双打，也有攻对守的男子双打。每场表演都只打两局，场场表演都博得了观众的热烈掌声。
