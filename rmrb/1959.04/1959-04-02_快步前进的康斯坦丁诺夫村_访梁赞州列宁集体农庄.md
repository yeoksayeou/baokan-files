Konstantinovo Village Forging Ahead
    ——A Visit to the Lenin Collective Farm in Ryazan Oblast
  　Our reporter　Chen Quanbi
    When spring plowing had already begun in southern Soviet Union, the Central Russian Plain was still in a season of severe cold and ice. When we visited the Lenin Collective Farm in Ryazan Oblast, our car could only stop far from the farm, near the highway, and we had to switch to a sleigh to move forward. The snowfield was a vast expanse of white, and all the buildings of the collective farm were buried under thick snow. In the distance, we could only see small black dots, which were hunters with their hounds waiting for the cunning foxes. Konstantinovo Village is rich in wild ducks and pheasants. Liubovnikov, the First Secretary of the Liubovnikov District Party Committee, joked that in summer, there are more hunting enthusiasts coming here from Moscow than there are wild ducks.
    The Farm Chairman, Govorushkin
    We arrived at the farm near dusk. After a hurried visit to the farm's cowshed and small hydroelectric power station, we accepted the invitation of the farm chairman, Govorushkin, to visit his home. The Russian winter night is cold, with outdoor temperatures around minus thirty degrees Celsius and howling winds on the snowfield, but the farm chairman's home was as warm as spring.
    Farm Chairman Govorushkin is a sincere, simple, and hospitable man who has worked on this farm for twenty-five years, experiencing almost the entire development path of the collective farm. He used to be a carpenter and once made the doors for the Kremlin Conference Hall. This time, he was one of the delegates from Ryazan Oblast to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, so he had the opportunity to see the small memento he left in the Kremlin three or four decades ago through his labor. Govorushkin is now a member of the CPSU Oblast Committee, a member of the District Committee, and a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Republic. The night before our visit, he had just met with voters from three districts. Due to his outstanding contributions in leading the collective farm, he was awarded the Order of Lenin. A few months ago, to commemorate his 25th anniversary of working on the farm, the Oblast Soviet awarded him a car.
    The Lenin Collective Farm is now a farm with diverse economic sectors, but it mainly engages in animal husbandry, utilizing the natural pastures on both sides of the Oka River. The farm currently has 5,300 hectares of arable land, 1,400 hectares of pasture, 50 hectares of orchards, and more than 3,500 head of various livestock.
  After the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee
    Everyone knows that the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee was a turning point in the Soviet Union's implementation of a correct agricultural policy. Govorushkin is a witness to the implementation of this correct agricultural policy, and he spoke to us about the situation of the farm five years ago. He said that the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee pointed out the shortcomings in the development of agriculture and animal husbandry nationwide at that time, such as the slow increase in the number of livestock, the small amount of meat provided to the state, the unresolved issue of livestock feed, and the insufficient utilization of the potential for animal husbandry production. Govorushkin said that these backward phenomena in the development of animal husbandry also existed in the Lenin Farm. At that time, the farm had only 270 publicly owned dairy cows, and the average milk yield per cow was no more than 1,200 kilograms. The annual amount of milk handed over to the state could only reach 150 tons. As for meat, a year at most could only hand over 200 quintals. The farm members did not understand the significance of raising piglets and calves for the development of meat production, and always sent the newborn piglets and calves to the market for sale. Although there were good conditions for raising poultry and rabbits, they were not well utilized. The feed problem was also not resolved. Livestock mainly relied on planted pasture for feed, which was not only low in yield but also lacked nutrition. The changes in animal husbandry production in the past five years have been enormous. Govorushkin said, but after the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, due to the Party's emphasis on the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and due to correct policies and proper management, the animal husbandry of the Lenin Farm has developed rapidly in recent years. Today, the number of dairy cows on the farm has increased from 270 to 720, and the average milk yield per cow has increased from 1,200 kilograms to 3,820 kilograms. The total amount of milk production has increased threefold in five years, and the milk sold to the state has increased from 150 metric tons to 1,660 metric tons. In terms of meat production, it has almost tripled in five years, and the meat handed over to the state has also tripled. Due to the development of animal husbandry, the farm's cash income and the collective farmers' labor day income have also increased. In 1953, the farm's income from animal husbandry was only 270,000 rubles, but by the end of last year, it had increased to 3 million rubles. Five years ago, the cash income per labor day for farm members was only 30 kopecks, but now it has increased to nine rubles. These vivid figures demonstrate the leapfrog development of Soviet collective farms in the economy in the past five years, and also prove the correctness of the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee and the enormous role it has played in the development of national agriculture and animal husbandry.
        Vigorously Promote Meat Production
    This year, Ryazan Oblast fired the first shot in the national meat production campaign. They want to increase meat production threefold compared to last year, deciding to hand over 150,000 tons of meat to the state this year, and proposing to complete the seven-year plan in meat production within three years.
    This year, the Lenin Collective Farm will launch a full-scale advance on the meat production front. They plan to increase meat production threefold, that is, to produce 3,400 quintals of meat throughout the year, handing over 3,000 quintals of meat, that is, an average of 250 quintals per month, exceeding the total amount handed over to the state in 1953. This requires greatly expanding the number of livestock. They plan to raise 550 cattle, 1,100 pigs, 500 sheep, 50,000 poultry, and 10,000 rabbits within this year. Expanding the number of livestock makes the feed problem a major issue. This year, the farm plans to expand the area planted with corn from 80 hectares last year to 100 hectares. In addition, they will plant hundreds of hectares of perennial and annual pasture and some leguminous crops to ensure that each livestock has more than 10 tons of silage this year.
    The youth of the farm are running at the forefront of the great advance in meat production. They put forward a resounding slogan to be solely responsible for raising 50,000 waterfowl in the river bends of the Oka River by the youth and students this year, so that the youth can hand over 100 tons of valuable poultry meat to the state this year. Raising rabbits is also a major source of increasing meat production. Now, in several seven-year schools of the Lenin Farm, students raise an average of dozens of rabbits per person.
          Learn From Good Experience
    The collective farm in Kalinovka Village, Kursk Oblast, is a well-known advanced farm in the Soviet Union. The experience of this farm is also a target that the Lenin Farm has always paid attention to. In recent years, the Lenin Farm has sent representatives to Kalinovka Village four times to learn. The experience of the Kalinovka Village members selling all the dairy cows to the farm is now being implemented in the Lenin Farm. Since the second half of last year, the Lenin Farm has purchased all the dairy cows raised by individual farm members. In addition, the Lenin Farm is also preparing to implement the monthly wage system for farm members that Kalinovka Village had implemented long ago in April this year, and to change the economy of various departments into economic accounting. The method of mechanized corn planting in Kalinovka Village is also being learned by the Lenin Farm. It only takes 0.17 labor days to harvest one ton of green feed in Kalinovka Village on average, saving labor six or seven times more than using manual labor. The saving of labor for planting green feed, of course, can greatly reduce the cost of milk and meat production. The square pasture and day and night grazing methods used in Kalinovka Village for fattening livestock are also an effective way to accelerate livestock fattening.
  In the Cowshed
    When we visited the farm's cowshed, Dubrotov, the biology teacher of the farm's seven-year school, was giving a political lesson to the milkers of the cowshed. It turned out that many of the young milkers in this cowshed were Dubrotov's students. After the students graduated, the school and teachers have been caring for them, giving them two lessons a week to help them improve their political and cultural levels.
    We met the milker Polyakova, who has been working in this cowshed for eight years. Polyakova is in charge of nine cows by herself. Among these nine cows, her favorites are two named Grubek and Qingjia, because these two cows can produce an average of 27 liters of milk every day. The dairy cows cared for by Polyakova produced an average of 5,200 kilograms of milk per cow last year. She is still trying to find ways to improve this year. We asked her how she could make the milk yield so high. She said that there is no secret. In a word, it is to feed well, take care of well, and milk well. She said that she should take care of the dairy cows under her care like taking care of her own children, and the problem will naturally be solved.
    The Lenin Collective Farm in Konstantinovo Village is only a medium-sized farm in Ryazan Oblast. But from the farm chairman to the milkers, how enthusiastically and actively they are involved in the struggle to complete the seven-year plan for meat production in three years! In this case, completing the huge task of Ryazan Oblast's threefold increase in meat production this year is of course without any doubt. (Attached pictures)

    快步前进的康斯坦丁诺夫村
    ——访梁赞州列宁集体农庄
  　本报记者　陈泉璧
    当苏联南部已经开始春耕的时候，中部俄罗斯平原上还是严寒冰封的季节，我们到梁赞州的列宁集体农庄去访问时，汽车只能在离农庄很远的公路旁停下，改乘雪橇前进。雪原上白茫茫一片，集体农庄的一切建筑物都被掩没在厚厚的积雪下。远处，只见星星的黑点，那是猎人们带着猎犬正在守候着狡猾的狐狸。康斯坦丁诺夫村盛产野鸭和野鸡，柳波夫尼科夫区区委第一书记柳日夫尼科夫开玩笑地说，夏季从莫斯科来到这里的狩猎爱好者，比这里的野鸭还要多呢。
    农庄主席戈沃洛施金
    我们到达农庄，已近黄昏时分。匆匆参观过农庄的牛棚和小型水力发电站后，就应农庄主席戈沃洛施金之邀到他家去作客。俄罗斯的冬夜是寒冷的，室外温度约在零下三十多度，雪原上狂风呼啸，但农庄主席家里却温暖如春。
    农庄主席戈沃洛施金是一位诚恳朴实而又好客的人，他在这个农庄工作已经二十五年了，差不多经历了整个集体农庄发展的道路。他从前是个木匠，曾经做过克里姆林宫会议大厅的门，这次他是梁赞州参加苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的代表之一，因此他有机会看到他在三、四十年以前用自己的劳动给克里姆林宫留下的这一点小小的纪念。戈沃洛施金现在是苏共州委委员、区委委员，而且是俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃的代表。我们去的前夜，他还刚和三个区的选民进行了会见。由于他在领导集体农庄方面有卓越的贡献，他曾得过列宁勋章，几个月前，为纪念他参加农庄工作二十五周年，州苏维埃又奖给他一辆小汽车。
    列宁集体农庄现在是一个多种经济部门的农庄，但主要是经营畜牧业，利用奥卡河两岸的天然牧场。农庄现有耕地五千三百公顷，牧场一千四百公顷，果园五十公顷，有各种牲畜三千五百多头。
  苏共中央九月全会以后
    谁都知道，苏共中央1953年的九月全会，是苏联贯彻正确的农业政策的一个转折点。戈沃洛施金是实行这个正确的农业政策的见证人，他和我们谈起了这个农庄五年前的情况。他说，苏共中央九月全会的决议，指出了当时在全国发展农业和畜牧业上的缺点，如牲畜的头数增加得很慢，提供给国家的商品肉类很少，牲畜的饲料问题没有解决，畜牧业生产的潜力没有充分发挥等。戈沃洛施金说，在发展畜牧业上的这些落后现象在列宁农庄也是存在的。那时，农庄的公有奶牛只有二百七十头，每头奶牛的平均挤奶量最高不过一千二百公斤。每年上交给国家的牛奶只能达到一百五十吨。至于肉类，一年顶多只能上交二百公担。庄员们不理解喂养小猪小牛对发展肉类生产的意义，总是把生下的小猪崽和牛犊送到市场去出卖。虽有良好的养禽养家兔的条件，也没有很好的利用。饲料问题也没有解决。牲畜主要依靠种的牧草来饲养，这种饲料不仅产量少，而且营养也不够。最近五年来在畜牧业生产上的变化是巨大的。戈沃洛施金说，但是在苏共中央九月全会之后，由于党对发展农业和畜牧业的重视，由于政策正确，经营管理得当，近年来列宁农庄的畜牧业飞跃地发展起来。如今，农庄奶牛的头数由从前的二百七十头增加到七百二十头，每头奶牛的平均挤奶量由一千二百公斤已增加到三千八百二十公斤。牛奶生产的总量五年内增加了三倍，交售给国家的牛奶由从前的一百五十公吨增加到现在的一千六百六十公吨。在肉类生产上，五年来几乎增加了三倍，上交给国家的肉类也增加了三倍。由于畜牧业的发展，农庄的现金收入和集体农民劳动日的收入也增多了。1953年这个农庄的畜牧业的收入不过二十七万卢布，但到去年年底，已增加到三百万卢布。五年前农庄庄员每一劳动日的现金收入只有三十戈比，而现在已增加到九个卢布。这些鲜明的数字，正说明苏联的集体农庄在最近五年来在经济上有着飞跃的发展，也证明着苏共中央九月全会决议的正确和它在发展全国农业和畜牧业中所发挥出的巨大作用。
        大搞肉类生产
    今年梁赞州在全国肉类生产上放出了第一炮，他们要在今年把肉类生产比去年提高三倍，决定这一年就要给国家上交十五万吨肉类，并提出在肉类生产上要在三年内完成七年计划。
    列宁集体农庄今年在肉类生产战线上，要来一个全面大进军。他们准备把肉产量增加三倍，即全年要生产三千四百公担肉，上交三千公担肉，即每月平均要上交给国家二百五十公担，超过了1953年全年上交给国家的数字。这就必须大力扩大牲畜的头数，他们计划在今年一年内要喂养五百五十头牛，一千一百头猪，五百头羊，五万只家禽和一万头家兔。扩大牲畜的头数，饲料问题是一个大问题。农庄今年准备把玉蜀黍从去年种的八十公顷扩大到一百公顷，另外还要种几百公顷多年生和一年生的牧草和一些豆类作物，以保证今年每头牲畜有十吨以上的青贮饲料。
    农庄的青年们跑在肉类增产大进军的前列，他们提出一个响亮的口号，要在今年内由青年和学生单独负责，在奥卡河的河湾喂养五万只游禽，这样青年们今年就可向国家交纳一百吨贵重的禽肉。喂养家兔也是增产肉类的一大来源，现在列宁农庄的几个七年制学校中，学生平均每人养着几十头家兔。
          吸取好经验
    库尔斯克州卡里诺夫卡村集体农庄是全苏闻名的先进农庄。这个农庄的经验也是列宁农庄一向注意的目标。近年来，列宁农庄曾四次派出代表到卡里诺夫卡村去学习。卡里诺夫卡村庄员把奶牛全部卖给农庄的经验，现在正在列宁农庄实行。列宁农庄从去年下半年起就把全体庄员个人喂养的奶牛全部购买进来了。另外，列宁农庄也准备在今年4月实行卡里诺夫卡村早就实行的庄员的按月工资制，并将各部门的经济改成经济核算制。卡里诺夫卡村机械化种植玉米的方法，列宁农庄也在学习。卡里诺夫卡村平均收获一吨青饲料只要花零点一七个劳动力，比用手工劳动节省劳动力六、七倍。种植青饲料劳动力的节约，当然就能大大降低奶和肉类生产的成本。卡里诺夫卡村在肥育牲畜上所采用的方形草地和昼夜放牧的方法，也是加速牲畜肥育的一个有效方法。
  在牛棚里
    我们到农庄的牛棚去访问时，农庄七年制学校的生物教员杜布洛托夫正在为牛棚的挤奶员上政治课，原来这个牛棚的许多青年挤奶员，都是杜布洛托夫的学生。学生毕业后，学校和教员们还一直关心着他们，每星期为他们上两次课，帮助他们提高政治水平和文化水平。
    我们认识了挤奶员波利亚科娃，她在这个牛棚工作已有八年了。波利亚科娃一个人管九头牛，这九头牛中她最喜欢的是名叫格鲁倍克和秦加的两头，因为这两头牛每天平均都能出奶二十七公升。波利亚科娃照管的奶牛去年平均每头出奶达五千二百公斤，今年她还正在想办法再提高。我们问她，她怎样会使挤奶量达到这么高。她说，这并没有什么秘诀，一句话，就是要喂得好，照管得好，挤奶挤得好。她说要把自己照管的奶牛像照管自己的孩子一样来照管，什么问题就自然解决了。
    康斯坦丁诺夫村的列宁集体农庄，在梁赞州中不过是一个中等的农庄。但是从农庄主席到挤奶员，都是怎样热情地、积极地投入了三年完成肉类生产七年计划的斗争啊！在这种情况下，完成梁赞州今年肉产量增加三倍的巨大任务，当然是毫无疑问的。（附图片）
