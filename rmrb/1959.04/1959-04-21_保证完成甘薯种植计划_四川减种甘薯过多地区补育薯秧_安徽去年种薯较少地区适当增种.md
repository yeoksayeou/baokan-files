To guarantee completion of the sweet potato planting plan:
	Sichuan Areas with Excessive Reduction in Sweet Potato Planting Replenish Seedlings
	Anhui Areas with Fewer Seed Potatoes Last Year Appropriately Increase Planting

Chengdu, April 20th (from our newspaper) – Sichuan Province has completed the sowing of over ten million mu of sweet potatoes planned for this year; in the earlier season areas of southern Sichuan, some have already begun transplanting ahead of schedule.

	Wanxian Special District, one of the main sweet potato producing areas, explicitly proposed: "To get through the refined grain barrier, sweet potatoes are the backing," enabling cadres and the masses to have a correct understanding of the relationship between coarse and refined grains. After inspection, some areas that had excessively reduced the sweet potato planting area promptly replanted sweet potato seeds; the sweet potato planting area in this special district was initially reduced from 3.3 million mu last year to 1.6 million mu, but has now increased to 2.6 million mu. The counties have also strengthened the management of sweet potato seedling cultivation. Neijiang Special District, in order to ensure early planting, dense planting, and increase yield per unit area, increased the amount of seeds used per mu from 280 jin last year to 500 jin. In addition, they have also stored a large number of improved varieties, preparing to seize the gaps in agricultural production and launch a "seize every opportunity" blitz to plant sweet potatoes.

Hefei, April 20th (from our newspaper) – While focusing on rice planting, Anhui Province has arranged for the production of the high-yield crop – sweet potatoes. This year, Anhui Province plans to plant over 18 million mu of sweet potatoes, an increase of about one million mu compared to last year. Among them, spring sweet potatoes in particular, due to their higher yield, are planned to reach over 6 million mu this year, more than three times the area planted during the same period last year.

	Liuan and Wuhu Special Districts, which planted fewer sweet potatoes last year, plan to plant over 1.5 million mu in Liuan Special District this year, more than double the area planted last year; Wuhu Special District plans to increase the planting area by 60% compared to last year. Xuancheng County, which last year concentrated sweet potato planting in five people's communes, including Wanzhi and Xianjin, will have all sixteen people's communes plant sweet potatoes this year.

	In order to solve the problem of seed potatoes and technology needed for expanding sweet potato planting areas, Fuyang Special District assisted Wuhu Special District in solving the problem of seed potatoes needed for 150,000 mu of sweet potato land. Wuhu Special District recently launched extensive technical training classes for planting sweet potatoes, and more than 50,000 farmer technicians have been trained in the entire special district.

	After guaranteeing a certain planting area for sweet potatoes in their plans, the people's communes in various parts of Anhui Province are doing everything possible to increase the yield per unit area of sweet potatoes. This year, the province-wide sweet potato seedling cultivation work began universally adopting warm beds and greenhouses for sowing and seedling cultivation as early as "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects). Seedling cultivation throughout the province can ensure timely transplanting for this year's planned planting area. (Li Xiangren)

    保证完成甘薯种植计划
    四川减种甘薯过多地区补育薯秧
    安徽去年种薯较少地区适当增种
    本报成都20日电　四川省今年计划种植的一千多万亩甘薯，已播种完毕；季节较早的川南地区有的已提前开始栽插。
    甘薯主要产区之一的万县专区明确提出：“要过细粮关，甘薯作后盾”，使干部和群众对粗细粮的关系有了正确认识。经过检查，一些把甘薯种植面积压缩过多的，都及时补种了薯种；这个专区甘薯种植面积最初由去年的三百三十万亩压缩到一百六十万亩，现又增加为二百六十万亩，各县还加强了甘薯育苗管理工作。内江专区为了保证早栽密植，提高单位面积产量，每亩用种量由去年的二百八十斤增加为五百斤。此外，他们还储备了大批良种，准备抓住农事生产空隙，抽出人力开展一个“见缝插针”的突击种薯运动。　（刘宗棠）
    本报合肥20日电　安徽省在大抓水稻种植的同时，安排了高产作物——甘薯的生产。今年安徽全省计划种植甘薯达一千八百多万亩，比去年扩大约一百万亩。其中，特别是春甘薯，由于产量较高，今年计划种植面积将达到六百多万亩，比去年同期扩大三倍以上。
    去年种植甘薯面积较少的六安、芜湖两专区，今年六安专区计划种植面积为一百五十多万亩，比去年扩大一倍以上；芜湖专区计划种植面积比去年扩大60％。宣城县去年种植甘薯都集中在湾址、先进等五个人民公社，今年全县十六个人民公社都要种植甘薯。
    为了解决扩大种植甘薯地区所需的薯种和技术问题，阜阳专区协助芜湖专区解决了十五万亩甘薯地所需的薯种，芜湖专区最近发动各地大办种植甘薯技术训练班，全专区已培训了农民技术员五万多人。
    安徽省各地人民公社在计划上保证甘薯有了一定的种植面积以后，正在千方百计地提高甘薯的单位面积产量。今年全省甘薯育苗工作，早在“惊蛰”，就普遍采用温床、温室下种育苗，全省育苗可以保证今年计划种植面积适时栽插。
