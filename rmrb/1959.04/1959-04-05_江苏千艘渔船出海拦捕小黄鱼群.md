Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 4th: More than a thousand fishing boats from coastal Jiangsu set sail on April 1st to intercept schools of small yellow croaker. The No. 304 fishing vessel of the Jiangsu Provincial Marine Fisheries Company, which set out in mid-March, earlier than the rest, has already achieved a high yield record of catching more than 151,000 *jin* of small yellow croaker in one trip.

This year, the climate in coastal areas of Jiangsu has warmed up earlier and the water temperature is higher. In order to win the first battle of spring fishing production this year, many areas have held departure rallies. Fishermen in Changshu, Qidong, and other counties have also launched fishing competitions between boats, teams, and work areas. Fishermen in Dafeng County proposed a competition initiative to fishermen in brother counties: "Work hard and drill diligently, ten thousand *jin* of fish per ton boat, strive for first place in the province, and strive to go to Beijing." Fishermen in Rudong and other counties immediately responded enthusiastically with actions of "setting sail early, starting production early, catching more rebounding waters, and achieving fast fishing, fast loading, fast transportation, and fast unloading."

    江苏千艘渔船出海拦捕小黄鱼群
    新华社南京4日电　江苏沿海一千多艘渔船在4月1日扬帆出海，拦捕小黄鱼群，提前在3月中旬出海的江苏省海洋渔业公司三○四号渔轮，已创造了一行次捕获十五万一千多斤小黄鱼的高产纪录。
    今年江苏沿海地区气候回升早、水温高，为了打胜今年春汛生产第一仗，许多地区都分别召开了出海誓师大会，常熟、启东等县渔民还在船与船、队与队、工区与工区之间展开了捕鱼竞赛。大丰县的渔民向兄弟县的渔民们提出了“干劲加钻劲，吨船万斤鱼，全省夺头名，争取上北京”的竞赛倡议，如东等县渔民立即用“早开船、早生产、多打复水、做到快打、快装、快运、快卸”的行动来热烈响应。
