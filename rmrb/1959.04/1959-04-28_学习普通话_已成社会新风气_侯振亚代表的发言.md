Comrades of the Presidium, fellow delegates:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's reports, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report. I also wholeheartedly support the Central People's Government's order to quell the rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, as well as all the measures taken to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities. We express our utmost indignation and resolute opposition to the despicable acts of the British imperialists and Indian expansionists who collude to interfere in our country's internal affairs!

Under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the radiant guidance of the Party's general line for building socialism, the people of Fujian have not only achieved rapid development in industrial and agricultural production over the past year, but have also achieved brilliant victories in the technological and cultural revolutions. As a component of the cultural revolution, the work of promoting Mandarin has also achieved great success. Now, allow me to report to the conference on the brief situation of the work of promoting Mandarin in Fujian.

Fujian's dialects are notoriously complex and difficult to understand throughout the country. From a broader regional perspective, the dialects of eastern Fujian, western Fujian, southern Fujian, northern Fujian, and Fuzhou differ greatly and are mutually unintelligible. Even within a county or township, there can be several dialects. The complexity of dialects has brought great inconvenience to the people of Fujian in their production and life, and has also affected the development of various tasks. In the first few years after liberation, cadres from the north generally spoke or gave reports in Mandarin, and the masses said: "Mandarin, can't understand, sounds like a duck listening to thunder." Cadres also couldn't understand the local dialects and felt very distressed, even causing losses to the work. For example, in the Wushan Township during the land reform movement, a landlord element named Chen Zongyuan, who could speak Mandarin, took advantage of the masses' lack of understanding of Mandarin, pretended to be progressive, acted as a translator, and often translated good words into bad words, and good things into bad things. In the past, large-scale meetings in a county often required translation into several local dialects. Some people described it as holding an "international conference." Many township and commune cadres had great difficulty understanding reports made in Mandarin, and they also found it difficult to convey the messages when they returned. Not long ago, farmers from Guangdong Province came to Minhou County, Fujian, for a tour and visit. Some farmers couldn't understand Mandarin. Every sentence had to be translated from Cantonese to Mandarin, and then to Minhou dialect. One question and one answer required four turns, so they couldn't speak freely. In daily life, the losses suffered due to not being able to speak Mandarin are too numerous to mention. For example, a farmer in Putian County wanted to take a bus to "Jiangkou" (only more than 20 kilometers away), but mistakenly took it to "Guankou" in Tongan County, more than 100 kilometers away.

The people of our province have deeply realized the suffering of not understanding Mandarin from their practical lives, and therefore have an urgent need to learn and use Mandarin. In particular, with the rapid development of socialist construction, the rural areas have realized the people's commune system, which requires greater scope of mutual cooperation and exchange of experience; in the cities, industry has developed rapidly, and the number of workers has increased sharply. These workers come from all directions, and the complexity of languages ​​will affect learning and production in some aspects. Narrow local dialects can no longer meet the needs of the development of the situation, and the people of the province are even more eager for unifying the languages ​​of various places and promoting Mandarin.

Based on this situation, for several years, the Party and government leaders of our province have attached great importance to the work of promoting Mandarin. After the First National Conference on Language Reform, the Fujian Provincial Committee for the Promotion of Mandarin was established, and many Mandarin Pinyin broadcast lectures, language reform lectures, and language training classes were held, cultivating more than 40,000 backbone teachers. At the same time, reports, symposiums, and various publicity tools were frequently used to carry out vigorous publicity to the masses, creating favorable conditions for the comprehensive promotion of Mandarin. Because people have been speaking dialects and local languages ​​for thousands of years, and it is inevitable that there will be many ideological obstacles if they are asked to learn to speak Mandarin for a while. For example, some people said: "Mandarin is the language of cadres, not spoken by the masses"; the elderly said: "I'm about to sleep in a coffin, and still learning to speak official language with the King of Hell"; women said: "Learning Mandarin is still just washing the pot"; even some places have "conditionalism", "feudal dialectalism", and the "foreign language invasion theory" of localists, believing that Mandarin cannot be promoted in mountainous areas, it is not easy to promote Mandarin in dialect areas, and forgetting the dialect after learning Mandarin is forgetting one's roots, and so on. Therefore, promoting Mandarin is an arduous political and ideological task, and the Party's leadership must be strengthened, politics must be in command, and in-depth and meticulous ideological work must be carried out on various backward and conservative ideas. For example, Datian County adopted a combination of recalling and comparing, complaining, and big airing, big contending, and big debating to improve the masses' understanding, thereby eliminating various ideological obstacles and enabling the work of promoting Mandarin to proceed smoothly.

Promoting Mandarin is also a mass work, and it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, closely integrate it with production, and carry it out vigorously. For example, Nan'an County launched a "Mandarin Promotion Month" in September last year, posting nearly 100,000 propaganda slogans throughout the county and holding a 10,000-person oath-taking meeting. Some counties organized 10,000-person propaganda commando teams to go deep into the fields, teaching and explaining at the same time. Some used movies, dramas, and storytelling to launch a mass upsurge in learning Mandarin. Learning Mandarin wherever production takes place, bringing Mandarin to the mountains, fields, construction sites, people's schools, families, canteens, meeting places, etc., achieving "speaking what you do, learning and speaking everywhere," and even the elderly in their sixties took the lead in learning to speak Mandarin. In terms of teaching content, it is also combined with production, first learning commonly used words in daily life and production, such as hoe, sickle, plowing, comrade, etc. Some places compiled the tools they bring to the fields and the work they do into living textbooks, and used the rest time before and after work to have the people's school teachers teach everyone to learn. Wuling Township brought the slogan proposed by the Party committee, "Agricultural tools as swords and guns, the fields as battlefields, hard work plus skillful work, ensure the victorious completion of the summer harvest and summer planting tasks," to the fields and people's schools to teach everyone to learn. In this way, they learned Mandarin and culture, and also promoted and promoted production and central work.

In addition, in order for the masses to persist in learning Mandarin, it is also necessary to carry out regular and meticulous work. Here, we mainly focus on two fronts, namely ordinary schools and spare-time schools. In our province, ordinary schools, whether universities, middle schools, primary schools, or kindergartens, generally use Mandarin teaching. This lays a good foundation for promoting Mandarin. Among the masses, the main focus is on the spare-time school front. Most of the spare-time schools at all levels in our province also use Mandarin teaching, which not only allows students to learn culture, but also learn Mandarin, achieving two goals with one effort, and the effect is very good. In order to consolidate and improve the results of learning Mandarin, many places have also actively organized the masses to learn the Mandarin Pinyin alphabet. At present, many places in the province have begun to hold Pinyin alphabet training classes to train backbone teachers, laying the foundation for the comprehensive development of the Pinyin learning movement.

Through the above series of efforts, learning Mandarin and speaking Mandarin has become a new social trend, and the number of people who can understand and speak Mandarin is also increasing day by day. Most of the young people in the province can speak and understand Mandarin. Most of the middle-aged people who did not understand Mandarin in the past can now generally understand it. Now, in meetings, reports, and listening to the radio, many places no longer use translation, and the Party's policies and various tasks can be directly and quickly implemented among the masses. Due to the unified language, cadres and the masses can hear more real exchanges, and the relationship between each other is closer. It is also easier for the masses to exchange experiences and work together. Some farmers said: "In the past, I was afraid to go out because I didn't understand Mandarin, and I couldn't exchange experiences with others. Now that I understand Mandarin, I am not afraid to go out."

In recent years, although the work of promoting Mandarin in our province has achieved some results, it is still not done well enough. The development of the entire movement is not balanced enough. Some masses still feel unaccustomed to starting to speak Mandarin, and the masses in some areas can only roughly understand it and cannot speak much. In the future, we should continue to overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, muster greater efforts, advance victoriously, push the work of promoting Mandarin to a new climax, and strive to have more than 80% of the young people in the province basically be able to understand and speak Mandarin and learn the Pinyin alphabet within two or three years, and continuously improve the quality of listening and speaking Mandarin, so as to better serve the great leap forward in production and the cause of socialist construction!

If there are any inappropriate points in the above speech, please correct me, fellow delegates.

### 学习普通话　已成社会新风气  侯振亚代表的发言

    学习普通话　已成社会新风气
    侯振亚代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告，和彭真副委员长的报告。并衷心拥护中央人民政府为维护祖国的统一和各民族的团结，下令平定原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的叛乱以及所采取的一切措施。我们并对英帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子狼狈为奸地干涉我国内政的卑鄙行为，表示无上的愤慨和坚决的反对！
    福建人民在党和毛主席的正确领导下，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，一年多来，不但在工农业生产上有了飞跃的发展，而且在技术革命和文化革命方面，也取得了辉煌的胜利，作为文化革命的一个组成部分——推广普通话的工作，也同样做出了很大的成绩。现在，让我将福建推广普通话工作的简要情况，向大会作汇报。
    福建方言复杂难懂是全国闻名的，从大的地区看，闽东、闽西、闽南、闽北以及福州等地区的方言，差异很大，互不相通，甚至在一个县或一个乡之内也有好几种方言。大田县有十种互不相通的方言和几十种各有差异的土话，该县的吴山乡就有三、四种土话。方言复杂，给福建人民在生产和生活上带来了很大的不便，同时也影响到各项工作的开展。刚解放的头几年，北方来的干部一般是用普通话谈话或作报告，群众说：“普通话，听不懂，好像鸭子听雷轰”。干部也听不懂土话，感到很苦恼，甚至使工作受到损失。如吴山乡在土改运动中，一个会说普通话的地主分子陈宗源，利用群众不懂普通话的空子，假装进步，充当翻译，常常把好话翻成坏话，好事说成坏事。过去在一个县里开规模较大的会议，往往需要用好几种土话来翻译，有人形容说：像开“国际会议”。许多乡社干部听不懂用普通话作的报告，回去传达也感到很大困难。不久以前，广东省农民来福建闽侯县参观访问，有的农民听不懂普通话，每一句话都要从广东话翻成普通话，再翻成闽侯话，一问一答，转折四次，当然不能畅所欲言。在日常生活中，由于不会讲普通话而吃到的亏更是不胜枚举。如莆田县有个农民要搭汽车到“江口”去（仅离二十多公里），结果误搭到一百多公里远的同安县“灌口”去。
    我省人民从实际生活中深刻体会到不懂普通话的苦处，也就有学习普通话、使用普通话的迫切要求。特别是随着社会主义建设的飞跃发展，农村实现了人民公社化，需要更大范围的互相协作，交流经验；城市里工业迅速发展，工人骤然增加，这些来自四面八方的工人，语言复杂，某些方面也会影响到学习和生产。狭隘的地方方言已经不能适应形势发展的需要了，全省人民对统一各地语言、推广普通话的要求也就更加迫切了。
    基于这种情况，几年来，我省党政领导对推广普通话工作是十分重视的。在第一次全国文字改革会议以后，即成立了福建省推广普通话工作委员会，举办了多次的汉语拼音广播讲座、文字改革讲座和语训班，培养了教师骨干四万人以上；同时，还经常通过报告会、座谈会及运用各种宣传工具向群众进行大张旗鼓的宣传，为全面推广普通话，创造了有利的条件。由于人们讲方言、土话有几千年的因袭习惯，一时要他们学讲普通话，必然会有许多思想障碍。如有的人说：“普通话是干部话，不是群众讲的”；年老的人说：“快睡棺材板了，还学了跟阎王打官话”；妇女说：“学了普通话，还不是洗锅巴”；甚至有的地方存在“条件论”、“封建的大方言主义”和地方主义者的“外语侵略论”，认为山区不能推广普通话，方言区不好推行普通话，学会普通话忘了方言就是忘本，等等。因此，推广普通话是一项艰巨的政治思想工作，必须加强党的领导，政治挂帅，对各种落后思想和保守思想进行深入细致的思想工作。如大田县，采取了回忆对比、诉苦和大鸣、大放、大辩论相结合的办法，提高了群众的认识，从而扫除了各种思想障碍，使推广普通话的工作得以顺利地进行。
    推广普通话，同时又是一个群众性的工作，必须充分发动群众，密切结合生产，大张旗鼓地进行。如南安县在去年九月开展了“推广普通话运动月”，全县贴了近十万张的宣传标语，并举行了万人誓师大会；有的县组织了万人宣传突击队，深入田间，边教边讲，有的把电影、戏剧、评话等都利用起来，掀起了群众性的学习普通话的热潮。在哪里生产就在哪里学普通话，把讲普通话带到山上、田间、工地、民校、家庭、食堂、会场等地去，做到了“做什么讲什么，到处学到处讲”，连六十多岁的老汉也都带头学讲普通话。在教学内容上，也结合生产，先学习日常生活和生产中常用的话，如锄头、镰刀、犁田、同志等。有的地方把下田带什么工具，干什么活，编成活教材，利用干活前后的休息时间，由民校教师教大家学习。武陵乡把党委提出的“农具当刀枪，田头当战场，苦干加巧干，保证夏收夏种任务胜利完成”的口号，带到田间和民校教大家学习。这样，既学习了普通话和文化，又宣传和推动了生产和中心工作。
    另外，为了使群众学普通话能够坚持下去。还必须进行经常的、细致的工作，这里我们主要是抓住两个阵地，即普通学校和业余学校。我省普通学校不论是大学、中学、小学或幼儿园，一般都使用普通话教学。给推广普通话打下了良好的基础。在群众中主要是抓住了业余学校这个阵地。我省各级业余学校也大都用普通话教学，既做到学了文化，又学会了普通话，一举两得，效果很好。为了巩固提高学习普通话的成绩，不少地方还积极组织群众学习汉语拼音字母。目前全省很多地方都开始举办拼音字母训练班，训练师资骨干，为全面开展学习拼音运动打下了基础。
    经过上述一系列的努力，目前学普通话、讲普通话已成为社会的新风气，会听会讲普通话的人，也一天一天地多起来。全省青少年大多数都会讲、会听普通话，过去不懂普通话的壮年人，现在一般也都会听了。现在开会、作报告、听广播，很多地方不再用翻译了，党的政策和各项任务也能够直接、迅速地贯彻到群众中去。由于有了统一的语言，干部与群众之间，都能够更多地听到真实情况的交流，彼此的联系更加密切了；群众与群众之间，也更便于交流经验、协同工作，有的农民说：“过去不懂普通话，害怕出门，有了经验也没法跟人家交流，现在懂了普通话，出门就不怕了。”
    几年来，我省推广普通话的工作，虽然获得了一些成绩，但还做得很不够。整个运动的发展还不够平衡，有些群众开始讲普通话还感到不习惯，有些地区的群众还只会粗略听听，不大能讲。今后，我们应继续克服右倾保守思想，鼓足更大的干劲，乘胜前进，把推广普通话工作推向新的高潮，争取在二、三年内，在全省壮、青、少年中有百分之八十以上基本上会听会讲普通话和学会拼音字母，并不断地提高普通话的听、讲质量，更好地为生产大跃进、为社会主义建设事业服务！
    以上发言，不妥之处，请各位代表指正。
