　　The Bandung Conference
　　From April 18 to 24, 1955, twenty-nine Asian and African countries held a conference in Bandung, Indonesia. This conference was the first held by Asian and African countries without the participation of Western colonial countries. It reflected the common aspirations and demands of the Asian and African peoples, who account for more than half of the world's population: to oppose colonialism, strive for and safeguard national independence, oppose wars of aggression, and maintain world peace, and on these bases to promote friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries.
　　The conference was initiated by five countries: Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan. In December 1954, the prime ministers of the five countries held a meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, and unanimously agreed to jointly initiate the convening of the Asian-African Conference, and agreed to invite twenty-five Asian and African countries to participate. Except for the Central African Federation, the remaining twenty-four countries accepted the invitation. They were: Afghanistan, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gold Coast (the old name before Ghana's independence), Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Nepal, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, South Vietnam, and Yemen. Our country sent a delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai to attend the conference.
　　Opposing colonialism, striving for and safeguarding national independence was a fundamental issue of the Asian-African Conference. Thanks to the joint efforts of many country delegations, the conference reached a consensus on this.
　　The conference issued a final communique on the 24th. The communique included seven items: economic cooperation, cultural cooperation, human rights and self-determination, the problem of dependent peoples, other issues, promoting world peace and cooperation, and a declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation. The declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation revealed the ten principles that serve as the basis for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among the countries concerned.
　　The Asian-African Conference was held jointly by twenty-nine countries with different social systems. However, the conference reached common views on some major issues. This proves that there are common interests and foundations between Asian and African countries. The success of the conference marked a great victory for the Asian and African people in the anti-colonialist struggle. Peace-loving people all over the world celebrated the victory of the conference. But it was hated by the colonialists, especially the American imperialists and their running dogs. The United States attempted to sabotage the conference before and during the meeting. But all failed shamefully.

　　万隆会议
    1955年4月18日至24日，亚非二十九个国家在印度尼西亚的万隆举行会议。这个会议是亚非国家第一次在没有西方殖民国家的参加下举行的。它反映了占全世界人口一半以上的亚非人民的共同愿望和要求——反对殖民主义，争取和保障民族独立，反对侵略战争，维护世界和平，并且在这些基础上促进亚非国家间的友好合作。
    这个会议是由缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦五个国家发起的。1954年12月，五国总理在印度尼西亚的茂物举行会议，一致同意联合发起召开亚非会议，并商定邀请了二十五个亚非国家参加，除中非联邦外，其余二十四个国家都应邀参加了。它们是：阿富汗、柬埔寨、中国、埃及、埃塞俄比亚、黄金海岸（加纳独立前的旧称）、伊朗、伊拉克、日本、约旦、老挝、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、利比亚、尼泊尔、菲律宾、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、叙利亚、泰国、土耳其、越南民主共和国、南越、也门。我国由周恩来总理率领代表团前往参加会议。
    反对殖民主义、争取和保障民族独立，是亚非会议的一个基本问题。由于许多国家代表团的共同努力，会议对此达成了一致协议。
    会议于24日发表了最后公报。公报包括经济合作、文化合作、人权自决、附属地人民问题、其他问题、促进世界和平和合作和关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言等七项内容。在关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言中，揭示了作为有关国家和平相处、友好合作的基础的十项原则。
    亚非会议是由二十九个社会制度不同的国家一起举行的。但是会议却在一些主要的问题上得到了共同的看法。这证明亚非国家之间有着共同的利益和基础。会议的成功标志着亚非人民在反殖民主义斗争中的一个巨大胜利。全世界爱好和平的人民都为会议的胜利而庆贺。但是却为殖民主义者特别是美帝国主义及其走狗们所仇视。美国曾在会前、会中进行破坏。但都可耻地失败了。
