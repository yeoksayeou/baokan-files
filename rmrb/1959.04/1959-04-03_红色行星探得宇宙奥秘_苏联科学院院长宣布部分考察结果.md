Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 2nd: TASS reported that the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Nesmeyanov, announced some important results of the Soviet Union's cosmic exploration using artificial satellites and space rockets at a recent annual meeting of the Academy of Sciences.

    Nesmeyanov first pointed out that, according to the results of the Soviet space rockets and the third artificial satellite's exploration, it has been determined that there are two powerful radiation belts near the Earth, both of which were formed by atomic explosions. This shows that the result of atomic explosions has created a powerful stream of charged particles at high altitudes, contaminating the universe near the Earth. The outer of these two radiation belts is scattered at an altitude equivalent to nine Earth radii (the Earth's radius is 6,400 kilometers). It is composed of electrons with energies of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of electron volts. Its two ends face the Earth's magnetic poles in the north and south, like a huge horseshoe embracing the Earth. The other radiation belt extends along the Earth's equator between 45 degrees north and south latitude at an altitude of about 1,000 kilometers. Its height in the western hemisphere is only about 600 kilometers. The properties of these two radiation belts are the same.

    Nesmeyanov then said that Soviet scientists have determined that the cause of the East Siberian geomagnetic anomaly is not due to the influence of the Earth's surface layer. The center of gravity of this phenomenon is in the depths of the Earth. There have been some hypotheses about this issue, but only the high-altitude measurement data from artificial satellites and space rockets have truly solved this problem for the first time. This conclusion is of great value for research in geomagnetism and mineralogy.

    In addition, Nesmeyanov pointed out another new discovery: with the help of space rockets, Soviet scientists have discovered a new current system outside the ionosphere, which is three to four Earth radii away from the Earth. This discovery will be of great significance for explaining magnetic storms and auroral phenomena.

    At the same time, the materials provided by the Soviet space rockets have fully confirmed that the past view that the outer edge of the atmosphere extended to 1,000 kilometers is incorrect. It can now be determined that this outer edge is several times farther than estimated.

    Soviet space rockets and satellites have also obtained the first materials on the density of interplanetary space gas. The first batch of materials has also been obtained regarding the density, temperature, and other aspects of electrons and positive ions in the atmosphere between 225 and 1,000 kilometers.

    Finally, Nesmeyanov said that the materials provided by the third artificial satellite have helped scientists determine the chemical composition of the outer atmosphere. It has been proven that atomic gas (ionized oxygen) is the main component of the gas composition between 226 and 800 kilometers, and the existence of the ionosphere depends on it.

    In addition to oxygen ions, nitric oxide ions were also recorded in the air up to 350 kilometers. Nesmeyanov finally pointed out that this is a very important discovery.

    红色行星探得宇宙奥秘
    苏联科学院院长宣布部分考察结果
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫在最近一次科学院年会上宣布了苏联利用人造卫星、宇宙火箭进行宇宙考察的部分重要结果。
    涅斯米扬诺夫首先指出，根据苏联宇宙火箭和第三个人造卫星的考察结果确定，在地球附近存在着两条强力的放射带，它们都是由于原子爆炸而形成的。这说明，原子爆炸的结果在高空造成了强力的带电粒子流，沾污了地球附近的宇宙。这两条放射带中，外边一条是散布在相当于九个地球半径的高空（地球半径为六四○○公里），它是由能量达几万到几十万电子伏特的电子构成的，它的两端对着南、北地球磁极，像一块巨大的马蹄铁环抱着地球。另一个放射带在南、北纬四十五度之间沿着地球赤道的方向伸延在一千公里左右的高空，它在西半球的部分高度仅有六百公里左右。这两条放射带的性质是相同的。
    涅斯米扬诺夫接着说，苏联科学家已经断定产生东西伯利亚地磁异常现象的原因不是由于地球表面层的影响，产生这种现象的重心在地球的深部。关于这个问题曾经有过一些假说，但只有依靠人造卫星和宇宙火箭的高空测量材料才真正第一次地解决了这个问题，这一结论对研究地磁和矿物学等方面都有重要价值。
    此外，涅斯米扬诺夫指出了另一个新的发现：由于宇宙火箭的帮助，苏联科学家发现了电离层以外的新电流系，这个电流系离地球的距离有三到四个地球半径那样远。这一发现对解释磁暴和极光现象将有重大的意义。
    同时，苏联宇宙火箭供给的材料已经完全证实，过去认为大气层的外缘伸展到一千公里的说法是不正确的，现在可以断定，这个外缘要比估计的远出几倍。
    苏联的宇宙火箭和卫星还第一次地获得了关于行星际空间气体的密度的材料。关于在二百二十五到一千公里的大气层内电子和阳离子的密度、温度等方面也都获得了第一批材料。
    最后，涅斯米扬诺夫说，第三个人造卫星所供给的材料帮助科学家们确定了外层大气的化学成分。已经证明，在二百二十六到八百公里之间原子态气（游离氧）是气体构成的主要成分，电离层的存在也正依靠于它。
    除去氧的离子，在高达三百五十公里的空中还纪录到了氧化氮的离子，涅斯米扬诺夫最后指出，这是一个非常重要的发现。
