    Under the Guidance of Makarenko
    -- Commemorating the Twentieth Anniversary of Makarenko's Death
    A.N. Shvid, Director of a Soviet Children's Labor Colony
    The imperialist war and the civil war, the famine and economic destruction of the early Soviet regime, left us with a group of homeless and destitute children. Some of these children took the path of illegality.
    The Communist Party and the great Lenin took all measures to eliminate this unfortunate situation as quickly as possible. The Party and economic organs, the People's Commissariat for Education, and the Commission for the Improvement of Children's Life led by Comrade Dzerzhinsky, all took action to combat the phenomenon of unattended and vagrant children.
    Anton Semyonovich Makarenko was one of the first to participate in this arduous work. The fulfillment of this task of great national significance required communist initiative and pedagogical talent. Marxist educator Makarenko possessed all these qualities. Under very difficult conditions, Makarenko spared no effort to organize a children's colony named after Gorky near Kuryazh, Kharkov. Hundreds of young offenders emerged from this colony and became honest, educated, and labor-loving people.
    Very humble and talented, completely humane, kind and amiable, strict with himself and his students – this is the image of Makarenko that remains in my mind, an image that I will never forget throughout my life. Today, when my childhood has become a distant past and I am engaged in the work of educating children myself, I feel especially how great Makarenko's influence on me has been. I miss him at all times in my work.
    ...Before I went to the Dzerzhinsky Commune, I had been to many kindergartens in Kiev and Kharkov. I clearly remember that whenever I went to a new kindergarten, they would always "study" me at the beginning. I had to describe my autobiography and all my habits and shortcomings in detail. Then, they measured my height and weight. A conclusion was drawn based on these materials. Usually, the "study" ended there. And in most cases, people were no longer interested in me.
    I was sent to the Dzerzhinsky Commune one morning and was immediately taken to Makarenko's office. His eyes carefully examined me through his glasses. He only asked my name and then ordered someone to call Olya Kharlamova. I later learned that she was a little girl in charge of managing clothing and was a member of the commune. When she arrived, Makarenko instructed: "Issue a uniform to this new commune member, Shvid, and assign him to the Third Team!" I don't remember how I went to the warehouse to collect the uniform. In a few days, I was already familiar with the entire situation of the commune, its rules, and strictly followed the well-organized routine.
    Frankly, what surprised me was that there was no more "study procedure" here, as had been done in those kindergartens. But what surprised me even more was that I soon knew, or rather, I felt that Makarenko knew everything about my situation. I felt completely under his control, but this was the first time in my life that it was a pleasant, rather than a painful feeling.
    Makarenko was good at finding even a little bit of good in every student, even the "worst" ones. This often had a decisive significance. He was good at respecting the personality of each student. Therefore, it was natural that when students felt such an attitude, they became bolder, more determined, full of confidence in their own strength, and began to fight against their shortcomings and bad habits with their own strength.
    Makarenko loved his career and his students infinitely, and we loved him equally. We could not but love such a person, who inspired us with the meaning of life and educated us in the spirit of love and loyalty to the great Marxist-Leninist ideas.
    Makarenko always spoke with enthusiasm about his beloved great Communist Party and its wise leader Lenin. For Makarenko, the Party was an excellent teacher and educator.
    Proficient in his career, Makarenko constantly improved his educational methods. He meticulously prepared for every report, every conversation with the students. He often worked fifteen or sixteen hours a day, while being full of infinite optimism. He contributed all his energy unreservedly to the cause of educating children. I remember that once people insisted that he go for recuperation, but in a few days, he returned to the commune.
    Makarenko taught us to be sincere and frank with each other and to live a hard and simple life. He required us to constantly engage in self-education and improve our cultural level. He instilled in me and many commune members the habit of reading.
    Makarenko constantly thought about new ways of educational work. He was keen not to allow any stagnation in his work and in the life of the children's collective. He was never satisfied with the achievements he had already made, and he required the students to do the same. I remember there was such an incident. Makarenko sent a group of students to the woods to chop firewood. In the evening, he personally went to the scene to see everyone's work. Seeing the piles of chopped firewood, Makarenko said, "You are really good, you have done a lot." But, after a pause, he thought for a while and then said, "You know, you could have chopped a little more!"
    Our mentor and friend Makarenko often kept in touch with his former students. He often cared for them, cared about their lives, and gave them valuable advice. I have seen this situation both in the commune and after leaving the commune. I don't know how many letters I received from Makarenko! With what joy and excitement I kept flipping through these letters written by Makarenko in fine handwriting. He used a friendly tone in the letters, respected people, and sincerely cared for his students.
    In 1939, shortly before his death, Makarenko came to Kharkov. He visited all his former students (there were quite a few of them) to see how they were living. And, I don't know how many former commune members went to Moscow to visit Makarenko! None of us didn't want to go to the capital to live with Makarenko for a few days. We went to see him as if we were going home, with the heart of seeing our closest relatives.
    Makarenko educated and transformed thousands upon thousands of people, training them into active builders and citizens of socialist society who were infinitely loyal to the cause of the Communist Party.

    在马卡连柯的教导下
    ——纪念马卡连柯逝世二十周年
    苏联儿童劳动教养院院长　阿·尼·施维德
    帝国主义大战和国内战争、苏维埃政权初期的饥馑和经济破坏现象，给我们遗留下一批无依无靠的流浪儿。其中的一部分孩子，走上了违法的道路。
    共产党和伟大的列宁，采取了一切措施，来尽速地消除这一不幸的局面。党和经济机关、教育人民委员部和捷尔任斯基同志领导的儿童生活改善委员会，都行动起来，为消除儿童无人照管和四处流浪的现象而斗争。
    安东·谢苗诺维奇·马卡连柯，是第一批参加这种艰巨工作的人之一。实现这个具有重大国家意义的任务，需要有共产主义的进取心和教育家的才艺。马克思主义教育家马卡连柯，具备了这一切条件。马卡连柯在非常困难的条件下，不遗余力地在哈尔科夫附近的库里亚什组织了一个以高尔基命名的儿童教养院。成百的少年犯罪者，从这个教养院出来后，都变成了诚实、有教养和热爱劳动的人。
    非常谦逊而有才干，完全富有人道精神，待人和蔼可亲，严格要求自己和学生，——这就是留在我脑海中的马卡连柯的形象，这个形象使我毕生难忘，在我的童年已经成为遥远过去的今天，我自己在从事教育儿童的工作。这使我特别感到马卡连柯给我的影响是多么巨大。我在工作中无时无刻总是怀念着他。
    ……在我到捷尔任斯基公社以前，我到过基辅和哈尔科夫的好多幼儿园，我清楚地记得，每当我到一个新的幼儿园，一开始总是对我
  “研究”一番。我必须不厌其详地叙述我的自传和一切习惯与缺点。然后，他们给我量身长和体重。根据这些材料做出一个结论。通常，
  “研究”算是到此为止。而且大多数场合下，人们不再对我发生兴趣了。
    我是在一个早晨被人送到捷尔任斯基公社来的，立刻就被领到马卡连柯的办公室。他的眼睛透过眼镜，细心地端详着我。他只问了我的姓名，就吩咐一个人把奥丽娅·哈尔拉莫娃叫来。我后来才知道，她是一个负责经管被服的小姑娘，是公社社员。当她来到以后，马卡连柯吩咐说：“给这个新社员施维德发制服，把他编入第三队！”我记不起怎样到仓库去领制服了。没过几天，我就已经熟悉了整个公社的情况、公社的规矩，并且严格地执行了井然的作息制度。
    坦白地说，使我感到吃惊的是，这里没有再对我实行“研究的手续”，像在那些幼儿园里做过的那样。但是，更加使我惊讶的是，不久我知道，更确切一点说，我已感到马卡连柯对于我的情况全都清楚。我感到自己完全处于他的掌握之下，但是这是有生以来第一次愉快的，而不是痛苦的感觉。
    马卡连柯善于在每一个甚至是最“坏”的学生身上，找到那怕是一丁点好的东西。这经常具有决定性的意义。他善于尊重每个学生的人格。因此，很自然地，学生们在感受到这样的态度时，也就变得更加大胆、坚决，对自己的力量充满信心，而且用自己力量开始同自己的缺点和恶习进行斗争。
    马卡连柯无限地热爱自己的事业和自己的学生，我们也同样地热爱他。我们不能不热爱这样的人，他给我们启发了生活的意义，他以热爱和忠于伟大马克思列宁主义思想的精神教育了我们。
    马卡连柯总是满腔热情地谈到他热爱的伟大的共产党及其英明的领袖列宁。党对于马卡连柯来说，是优秀的导师和培育者。
    精通自己事业的马卡连柯，经常不断地改善自己的教育方法。对于任何一次报告、任何一次同学生们举行的谈话，他都精心地进行准备。他经常每天工作十五、六个小时，同时又充满着无限的乐观主义精神。他把自己的全副精力都毫无保留地贡献给教育儿童的事业。我记得，有一次人们坚持要他去休养，可是不到几天，他又回到公社来了。
    马卡连柯教导我们彼此相处要真诚坦率，生活作风要艰苦朴素。他要求我们经常不断地进行自我教育和提高文化水平。他使我和许多公社社员养成了读书的习惯。
    马卡连柯经常想到教育工作的新途径。他热中于不使他的工作和儿童集体生活有任何停滞不进的现象。他决不满足于已经取得的成就，同样也要求学生们这样做。我记得有过这样一件事。马卡连柯派出一批学生到树林里去砍劈柴。傍晚的时候，他亲自到现场去看大家的工作。马卡连柯看到堆积如山的砍好的劈柴，说：“你们真是好样的，做的很多。”可是，停了一会儿，他想了想之后，又说：“要知道，还是可以再多砍一些的！”
    我们的导师和朋友马卡连柯，同他过去的学生经常保持着联系。他经常关照他们，关怀他们的生活，给他们提出宝贵的忠告。无论是在公社里或是从公社出来后，我都见到过这种情况。我不知接到了多少马卡连柯的来信！我以多么愉快和激动的心情不住地翻阅这些由马卡连柯以精美的书法写的这些信。他在信中使用友好的语调，尊重人，而且真诚地关怀自己的学生。
    1939年，马卡连柯在逝世前不久，来到了哈尔科夫。他访问了所有他过去的学生（这些人为数不少），看看他们的生活情况。而且，不知有多少从前的公社社员到莫斯科去拜访马卡连柯！我们当中没有一个人不想到首都去和马卡连柯在一起住上几天。我们去看他，正如到了自己家里一样，抱着去看自己最近的亲人的心情去看他。
    马卡连柯教育和改造了千千百百的人，把他们锻炼成无限忠于共产党的事业的、社会主义社会的积极建设者和公民。
