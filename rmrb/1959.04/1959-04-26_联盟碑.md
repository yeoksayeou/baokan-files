    Alliance Monument
    Yu Daoquan
    In the heart of Lhasa's Barkhor Street stands a majestic stone monument, known in Tibetan as "Do Ring," the famed "Nephew-Uncle Alliance Monument." It commemorates the marriages of Princess Wencheng and Princess Jincheng of the Tang Dynasty to Tibet, forging kinship between the Tang and Tibetan royal families, referred to as "nephew-uncle." The monument is inscribed in both Chinese and Tibetan, recording the names and official positions of the Han and Tibetan dignitaries who attended the grand ceremony. Historical records indicate this event occurred in the first year of Changqing during the reign of Emperor Muzong of the Tang Dynasty (821 AD), more than a thousand years ago. Many Chinese texts, including the Complete Tang Prose, Weizang Tongzhi, Tibetan Studies, and the Comprehensive Records of the Great Qing, mention the erection of this monument. The late Chinese linguist Mr. Luo Changpei even utilized the Han and Tibetan phonetic transcriptions on the monument to write a study on Middle Chinese phonology – The Northwestern Phonology of the Tang and Five Dynasties.
    This inscription is a precious historical document of early Han-Tibetan relations with a verifiable date and decipherable text, and serves as ironclad proof of Han-Tibetan kinship and friendship. After enduring more than a thousand years of wind and rain, many parts of the monument have become blurred. However, the Tibetan people firmly believe: "The Nephew-Uncle Alliance Monument is an incredible divine object that helps those in need. Businessmen who touch it in the early morning are guaranteed a successful day of trade; shepherds who touch it are assured their cattle and sheep will not go missing; farmers who touch it will see their crops flourish; students who touch it will be able to recite their books flawlessly without being punished; whoever touches it will be free from illness and disaster, and everything will go smoothly..." As a result, people touch it, early and late, making the lower part of the monument as smooth as a mirror, and the inscriptions are increasingly blurred...

    联盟碑
    于道泉
    在拉萨八角街里头矗立着一座巍峨的石碑，藏语叫做“多仁”，那就是著名的“甥舅联盟碑”，是说明了唐朝文成公主、金城公主先后嫁到西藏，和藏族王室结成亲戚关系，称做“甥舅”。碑上镌有汉藏两种文字，记录了参加那次盛大典礼的汉藏人员和官职。据历史记载，那是唐穆宗长庆一年（公元821年）的事，离开现在已经一千多年了。在许多汉文典籍像全唐文、卫藏通志、西藏考、大清一统志中都记载了有关立碑的条目。我国已故的语言学家罗常培先生，就曾利用这个碑身上的汉藏文字对音写出研究中古汉语的著作——唐五代西北方音。
    这碑文是早期的年代确凿、文字可考的汉藏关系的宝贵文献，是汉藏戚谊和友谊的铁证。经过一千多年的风雨剥蚀，碑身上许多部分已经模糊不清了，但西藏人民都这样相信：“甥舅联盟碑是个了不起的神物，它会来帮助不得意的人。做生意的人清早用手摸它一下，那一天生意一定顺利；牧童摸它一下，那一天牛羊不会丢失；种田的人摸它一下，庄稼定会长得兴旺；学生摸它一下，那天准能把书背诵得滚瓜溜熟，不挨竹板子；谁摸摸它，就会无病无灾，百事顺心……”于是，你也摸，我也摸，早也摸，晚也摸，把碑身下部摸得光滑如镜，文字模糊不清了……。
