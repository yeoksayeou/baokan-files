Workers' Words

    As long as one question is clarified
    In our society, as long as workers clarify the question: "Why do people work? For whom do they work?" they will have endless power to overcome any difficulties and create a happy future in the direction guided by the Party!
                Old Miner Zhang Zhaofu
    Only afraid of being detached from the masses
    No matter what difficulties there are, as long as they are handed over to the masses, they can be easily solved; when the masses act actively, any superstitious and decadent ideas will be completely shattered, and any miracle will be created. Therefore, we are not afraid of thousands of difficulties, only afraid of being detached from the masses.
    Song Zhengxin, Third Construction Site, Company One, Baiyin Factory
    Enthusiasm is the treasure of treasures
    Science and technology is a meticulous subject, and one must delve into it and study hard in order to become familiar with it and master it. However, without soaring enthusiasm, there can be no painstaking dedication. Therefore, the saying "enthusiasm is the treasure of treasures" is very true.
    Wang Chundi and others, Kunming Liaoyuan People's Commune Iron and Steel Plant

    工人的话
    只要弄清一个问题
    在我们的社会里，工人只要弄清楚这样一个问题：“人为什么要劳动？为谁劳动？”就会有无穷无尽的力量，去战胜任何困难，朝着党指引的方向，去创造幸福的未来！
                老矿工　张兆福
    只怕脱离群众
    无论有什么困难，只要交给群众就能迎刃而解；群众积极的行动起来，任何迷信和腐朽的观念都会被完全冲垮，任何奇迹都会创造出来。所以说，千难万难都不怕，只怕脱离群众。
    白银厂一公司三工地　宋正新
    干劲是宝中之宝
    科学技术是一个细致的学问，一定要钻进去，刻苦学习，才能熟悉它，掌握它。但是，没有冲天干劲，就不可能有刻苦的钻劲。所以，“干劲是宝中之宝，”这话很有道理。
