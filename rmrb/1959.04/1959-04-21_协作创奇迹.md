Collaboration Creates Miracles
Qiu Xinye, First Secretary of the CPC Fuxin Municipal Committee

Fuxin City is one of China's coal industrial bases, bearing the important task of supplying coal to major steel plants and other industries throughout the country. Last year, the Party Central Committee issued the great call to double steel production, which spurred a new high tide in coal production in Fuxin. However, due to the railway transportation work lagging behind, the contradiction between the surge in freight volume and insufficient transportation capacity became increasingly prominent. The situation was pressing. To ensure the "steel marshal" could be enthroned (i.e., meet steel production goals), coal production had to increase; for coal production to continue at a high level, transportation had to take the lead. Therefore, in November of last year, we put forward the slogan "Seize every second, demand cars from time, and ensure the enthronement of the steel marshal," launching a city-wide mass movement centered on collaboration to promote high coal transportation output.

The high transportation output movement from November of last year to March of this year proves that demanding efficiency from collaboration and demanding cars from time are important ways to ensure the continuous leap forward in railway transportation work. Over the past five months, Fuxin Station has not only completed the transportation tasks of coal for the steel industry and other sectors, but also, due to the continuous breakthrough in leap forward targets for shortening vehicle turnaround time, the average turnaround time has been reduced from 11.6 hours before the movement to 5.8 hours, with a doubling of transportation efficiency. Daily loading increased from 507 cars to 1,154 cars, saving the state 16,800 railcars, which can load more than 700,000 tons of coal.

In the Past, Two Ropes Could Never Be Twisted into One
Railway and coal mine, one produces coal, one transports coal, both shoulder the task of supplying "industrial grain," objectively requiring close cooperation between the two sides. The closer the cooperation, the higher the transportation efficiency. In the past, when dealing with the relationship between the two sides, both railway and coal mines often only cared about their own convenience, ignoring the difficulties of the other party; only calculating the economic benefits of their own enterprises, ignoring the political benefits of the entire socialist construction; not following the principle of "serving production and saving freight," but emphasizing their own "interests," and using fines to restrict each other. In the past, both parties only allowed the delivery and pickup of vehicles up to the railway-coal mine boundary line, and crossing it would cost money. In the past, the railway stipulated that vehicles staying in the mine beyond the target time would be fined according to regulations. Fearing fines, the coal mine would rush to load coal as soon as the cars arrived and send them back to the boundary line. On the surface, the time the vehicle stayed in the mine was short, but the railway received cars with mixed coal types, different directions, and disorder, which required a very difficult process of repeated operations to arrange them into trains and send them out. Because relying on fines to do things, the cooperative relationship between the two sides has not been well established, and there have often been situations where there is coal but no cars, large amounts of coal on the ground, and cars being backlogged with no coal. Because the railway and coal mine had a unclear understanding of the relationship of mutual promotion and mutual service, it was impossible to organize cooperation even if it was forced. Although institutions such as the "Joint Dispatch Office" have been established in the past few years to mediate the relationship between the two sides, the two ropes could never be twisted into one. The situation of railway transportation work lagging behind production has not been reversed for a long time.

Why couldn't we cooperate well in the past? It is because of departmentalism, unreasonable institutions, and outdated rules and regulations that hinder production. Therefore, only by vigorously launching mass movements, thoroughly breaking unreasonable rules and regulations, reforming the railway-coal mine system, and eliminating all ideological and organizational obstacles, can we achieve large-scale cooperation. In order to solve the problem of railway-coal mine cooperation, during the rectification movement, we guided the masses to direct the spearhead of rectification at departmentalism, and mobilized railway and coal mine workers to speak out freely and post big-character posters, exposing the serious harm of non-cooperation and discrediting departmentalism. Through extensive debates, two cognitive issues were resolved simultaneously. One was the issue of who railway transportation serves: railway transportation should serve industrial and agricultural production and the people's livelihood, and in Fuxin, it mainly serves coal mine production. The second was the relationship between coal mine production and railway transportation: transportation is a continuation of production and has a direct impact on coal mine production, so coal mines must also create conditions for railway transportation work.

Smash the Old, Establish the New, Unify Thinking, Unify Institutions, Unify Actions
Breaking down departmentalism and establishing communist ideas prepared the prerequisites for railway-coal mine cooperation. However, without unified organizational structures, truly close and seamless cooperation cannot be achieved. During the movement, the workers proposed: "The two companies are doing the same thing, why not merge them!" At this time, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Coal Industry also pointed out that railway-coal mine transportation departments could merge their institutions. Therefore, through consultations among the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, Fuxin Mining Bureau, and other relevant units, we reached an agreement to merge Xifuxin Station and the Vehicle Section of the Transportation Department of the Mining Bureau into Fuxin Station; to transfer the Sales Section of the Mining Bureau to the Transportation Department, and rename the Transportation Department as the Transportation and Sales Department. A general Party branch committee was established at the station, directly led by the Xifuxin Railway District Working Committee and the Party Committee of the Transportation and Sales Department. The organizations of the trade union and the Communist Youth League were also merged accordingly.

The merger of railway-coal mine transportation departments is not just a measure of organizational structure, but actually a reform of the system. Its profound significance lies in consolidating the ideological achievements gained in the rectification movement from the system, and eradicating the objective factors hindering railway-coal mine cooperation. In the words of the workers, "The railway and the mine are now one family." Solving such a fundamental problem in the system laid a solid foundation for large-scale railway-coal mine cooperation, and some long-standing unresolved problems were easily solved. What is particularly significant is that it linked the various links of railway-coal mine transportation into a whole, creatively learning and developing the advanced experience of the seven unifications of Camel Camp Station, and implementing twelve unifications in transportation management. Namely: unified thinking, unified leadership, unified institutions, unified production-transportation-sales, unified planning, unified dispatch, unified shifts, unified indicators, unified statistics, unified equipment, unified signals, unified inspection and summary, etc. These "unifications" are concentrated in unified thinking and unified institutions, thereby unifying planning and unifying action. The regulations on mutual fines were officially abolished, and the railway-coal mine boundary line was no longer a ditch hindering cooperation, but a station line facilitating cooperation, thereby leveraging equipment potential and increasing line capacity from 350 vehicles in the past to more than 800 vehicles now, with a maximum of more than 900 vehicles. This system revolution is the foundation of large-scale transportation cooperation and one of the important factors for the large-scale bumper harvest of high transportation output.

With the realization of the transportation system reform, the enthusiasm of the railway and coal mine workers soared. On this basis, the municipal Party committee launched a large-scale mass movement. Wherever the movement reached, drastic changes occurred. The three aspects of revolution, ideological, organizational and institutional, and technical, permeated each other in the movement, were mutually causal, and ran through the entire movement like a red thread. At the beginning of the high transportation output movement, there were two different ideas. One was to reach out to the state for railcars, thinking that what high output movement could be carried out with few railcars? Fearing that the movement would disrupt normal order; the other was to mobilize the masses to demand cars from time. In addition to organizing continuous criticism of various right-leaning conservative ideas, the more important thing we did was to adopt the method of deeply and extensively mobilizing the masses, combining the revolutionary drive of the broad masses with scientific analysis, and creating miracles. In the face of facts, conservative ideas finally surrendered.

During the high-output battles in November and December of last year, the Municipal Party Committee put forward the goal of "demanding cars from time, achieving a turnaround time of six hours, and fighting to prepare sufficient grain for the steel marshal!" When the target was achieved, some people said, "It's easy to achieve six hours or five hours a day, but it's not possible to achieve an average of six hours for the whole month." In January of this year, the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site transportation meeting in Fuxin, pointing out a new direction for the masses, requiring them to consolidate the turnaround time at the level of six hours for the whole month on the premise of ensuring safety and key priorities. In February, the broad masses of workers achieved an average of six hours for the whole month, winning the red flag award from the Provincial Party Committee. In March, we put forward the slogan: "Demand efficiency from cooperation, six hours for the whole month, and strive to achieve five and a half hours and load 1,200 cars per day." The workers responded to the Party's call, constantly breaking superstitions, liberating their minds, and shortening the turnaround time each time. This not only forcefully criticized conservative ideas, but also further encouraged the workers' soaring enthusiasm.

Shortening the turnaround time is closely related to reforming rules and regulations. Fuxin Station broke 830 outdated rules and regulations and established 723 new ones during the five-month movement. In the process of breaking and establishing, we grasped two principles: one was to break the rules and regulations that restrict the development of productive forces; the other was to implement the policy of safe production. In the past, some of the railway transportation rules and regulations were formulated according to the principle of "railway and mine as two separate entities" and outdated technical levels, which had to be abolished or revised. There must be establishment after demolition. Demolition and establishment are based on actual conditions, and it is not necessarily one demolition and one establishment. Some are cancelled, some are revised, and some are newly established rules and regulations. For example, Fuxin Station changed the eleven procedures for loading and transporting coal to five, and the turnaround time was shortened from 11.42 hours to five and a half hours, cutting more than half of the old technical operation process and doubling transportation efficiency. These are all fast, good, and economical working methods created by workers in the battle to seize every second. After repeated practice and promotion, they became a new working method.

Collaboration Sees the Emergence of "Red Flag Trains"
Collaboration is one of the basic characteristics of socialist production relations. Railway-coal mine collaboration, as well as city-wide large-scale collaboration, has greatly liberated productive forces, enabling unprecedented leap forwards in transportation work. The advanced experience of creating and organizing "Red Flag Trains" by the broad masses of coal loading and transportation workers in the movement is a concentrated manifestation of this large-scale collaboration. The characteristics of "Red Flag Trains" are: unified direction, ensuring key priorities, batch loading of cars, and centralized dispatch, reducing many operational processes such as dismantling, assembling, and marshalling. It is a new form of transportation organization work that emerges on the basis of unified production, transportation, and sales, and close collaboration. The turnaround time of "Red Flag Trains" does not exceed four hours. The facts of the past five months have proved that organizing "Red Flag Trains" is a magic weapon for shortening the turnaround time. The more communist large-scale collaboration develops, the more "Red Flag Trains" are launched; the shorter the turnaround time of "Red Flag Trains." For example, there were no "Red Flag Trains" before the high transportation output movement. At that time, the turnaround time was more than 14 hours. Since the birth of "Red Flag Trains" in December of last year, 48 trains were launched that month, and the average turnaround time for the whole month was 7.4 hours. Recently, a turnaround time of only less than one and a half hours has appeared, with the shortest being only 54 minutes. This has made the experience of launching "Red Flag Trains" develop to a higher stage.

The process of the emergence and development of "Red Flag Trains" is a process of development and improvement of railway-coal mine collaboration, unified production, transportation, and sales, and close coordination of all links in the entire loading and transportation process. Unified production, transportation, and sales is the foundation for organizing "Red Flag Trains." On this basis, the three aspects of production, transportation, and sales, according to coal output and variety, sales direction and quantity, and vehicle operation, carry out transportation organization work based on the principles of ensuring key supply and shortening turnaround time. This reduces many operational procedures of dismantling, assembling, and marshalling. At the same time, with the addition of workers' soaring enthusiasm, "Red Flag Trains" appear. The emergence of "Red Flag Trains" has promoted closer collaboration between shifts, between work stages, and between workers. In order to consolidate and improve the experience of "Red Flag Trains," workers help switchmen release vehicles; couplers help loading stations check car doors; braking teams help inspection teams check cars; and dozens of collaborative methods such as pre-compiling, pre-inspecting, slow-speed operation, quick weighing, and non-stop wheel loading have gradually developed into institutionalization. Now, the three work teams have jointly established a five-good collaboration system, namely: matching empty cars well, compiling loaded cars well, delivering and picking up material cars well, preparing locomotives well, and analyzing data well before shift handover, creating conditions for each other. In the past, it was "one person, one job," with uneven busyness and leisure. Now it is "one person, many skills," helping each other. After advocating and promoting this form of labor organization, from dispatchers to workers, from the eastern district to the western district, all aspects concentrated their efforts to shorten the turnaround time, finally making the launching of "Red Flag Trains" change from concentrating manpower and working overtime to a normal operational experience included in each shift's operation plan, consolidated, and developed. "Red Flag Trains" have become "promotion trains." It is a fruitful result of railway-coal mine collaboration and railway-coal mine institutional reform, and in turn promotes more extensive and closer collaboration in all links, connecting all links like a red thread, thereby greatly shortening the turnaround time.

From Railway-Coal Mine Collaboration to City-Wide Collaboration
The key to demanding cars from time is to demand efficiency from collaboration. The experience of the past five months proves that Party organizations must firmly grasp this link and continuously conduct ideological education on communist large-scale collaboration to all railway-coal mine workers and cadres. We have realized that railway transportation work is like a precise and complete machine. If one component fails, it will directly lead to a decrease in transportation efficiency. Therefore, railway-coal mine collaboration is not enough. We must also, on the basis of railway-coal mine transportation collaboration, do a good job in the collaboration between loading, unloading, and transportation, all the way to city-wide communist large-scale collaboration. For example, at the beginning of the movement, there were more than one million tons of coal accumulated on the ground. If the Municipal Party Committee had not mobilized all municipal government cadres, students, workers' families, street residents, and workers from various enterprises to form a loading army of more than 5,000 people, relying solely on the railway and coal mine themselves would not have been able to quickly load and transport so much coal on the ground. High transportation output is not only a product of railway-coal mine collaboration, but also a crystallization of city-wide large-scale collaboration. The wider the scope of collaboration, the higher the transportation output.

The practice of the past five months proves that the process of vigorously launching mass movements is a process of continuous revolution, that is, a process of continuous ideological revolution, organizational and institutional revolution, and technical revolution. Conducting ideological revolution in the high transportation output movement broke down all kinds of superstitious ideas, and people's minds were liberated. With ideological liberation, they dared to break down and establish boldly, breaking down the old systems and establishing new systems, which greatly promoted the development of productive forces, thereby consolidating the results of the ideological revolution. The development of productive forces, in turn, requires people to further liberate their minds. Therefore, vigorously engaging in technical revolutions in loading and unloading has become an important task in the high transportation output movement. After the completion of the five simple coal storage sheds currently under construction, which can store more than 35,000 tons of coal, it will play a significant role in ensuring the leap forward in coal production and transportation. We have realized that ideological revolution, organizational and institutional revolution, and technical revolution are organically combined in the mass movement of demanding cars from time and demanding efficiency from collaboration, promoting the continuous advancement of the movement. This is the inevitable law of movement development. That is: every time a superstition is broken, people's minds are liberated once; every time people's minds are liberated, production leaps forward; the leap forward in production, in turn, promotes people to further liberate their minds. Thereby making the movement continuously develop forward wave after wave. From the perspective of the relationship between coal production and coal transportation, initially coal high output forced transportation to also achieve high output; after transportation high output was carried out, it promoted both coal output and quality to leap forward, reaching an unprecedented peak in March, which in turn promoted the transportation front to engage in a large-scale technical revolution in loading and unloading to meet the needs of coal high output. Grasping this law of mutual promotion and mutual restriction to grasp coal production and transportation work can achieve the goal of coordinated production and transportation, producing more coal, and transporting more coal.

    协作创奇迹
    中共阜新市委第一书记　丘新野
    阜新市是我国煤炭工业基地之一，担负着供应全国大钢厂和其他工业用煤的重大任务。去年，党中央发出钢产翻一番的伟大号召，推动阜新的煤炭生产掀起了新的高潮。但是由于铁路运输工作没跟上，运量激增与运输能力不足的矛盾日益突出。形势逼人。要保钢帅升帐，必须增产煤炭；煤炭要继续高产，运输必须先行。于是，我们在去年11月提出：“分秒必争，向时间要车，确保钢铁元帅升帐”的口号，以协作为中心大搞群众运动，组织了全市规模的煤炭运输高产运动。
    从去年11月到今年3月的运输高产运动证明，向协作要效率、向时间要车是保证铁路运输工作不断跃进的重要途径。五个月来，阜新车站不仅完成了钢铁工业和其他方面用煤的运输任务，并且由于不断突破缩短车辆停留时间的跃进指标，平均一次作业时间从运动前的十一点六小时缩短到五点八小时，运输效率提高了一倍；日装车从五百零七车增加到一千一百五十四车，为国家节省了一万六千八百个车皮，可以多装七十多万吨煤。
    过去两股绳总是拧不成一股劲
    铁路和煤矿，一方生产煤炭，一方运输煤炭，共同担负着供应“工业粮食”的任务，客观上要求双方密切协作。协作得越密切，运输效率就越高。过去，路矿双方在处理互相间的关系时，常常是只顾自己方便，不管对方困难；只算本企业的经济账，不算整个社会主义建设的政治账；不是本着“服务生产，节约运费”的原则，而是强调本单位的“利益”，互相用罚款来制约。过去双方取送车辆只许到路矿交接线为止，越过就要花钱。过去铁路方面规定，车辆在矿停留时间超过指标就要按章罚款。煤矿怕挨罚，一看车来就赶忙装上煤炭送回交接线。表面上车辆在矿时间短了，但铁路接到的却是煤种混杂、方向不一、杂乱无章的车，要经过非常困难的重复作业过程，才能编排成列发出去。由于靠罚款办事，双方协作关系一直没有很好地建立起来，常常发生有煤无车、煤炭大量落地和有车无煤积压车辆的现象。由于铁路和煤矿对互相推动、互相服务的关系认识不清，硬要组织协作也是不可能的。几年来虽然成立过“联合调度办公室”等机构来调处双方关系，但两股绳总是拧不成一股劲。铁路运输工作落后于生产的局面，长期扭转不过来。
    为什么在过去不能很好地协作呢？就是因为有本位主义思想、不合理的机构和妨碍生产的陈规陋矩。因此，只有大搞群众运动，大破不合理的规章制度，改革路矿体制，扫除思想上和组织上的一切障碍，才能实现大协作。为了解决路矿协作问题，我们在整风运动中引导群众把整风的矛头指向本位主义，发动路矿双方职工大鸣大放贴大字报，揭发了不协作的严重危害，把本位主义思想搞臭了。通过大辩论，同时解决了两个认识问题。一个是铁路运输为谁服务的问题：铁路运输要为工农业生产和人民生活服务，在阜新主要是为煤矿生产服务。再一个是煤矿生产与铁路运输的关系问题：运输是生产的继续，对煤矿生产有直接影响，因此煤矿也要为铁路运输工作创造条件。
    大破大立统一思想统一机构统一行动
    破了本位主义思想，立起了共产主义思想，便为路矿协作准备了前提条件。但是组织机构不统一，真正密切无间的大协作还不能实现。在运动中，双方职工提出：“两家干的是一回事，干脆合起来吧！”这时，铁道部、煤炭部也指出了路矿运输部门可以合并机构的方向。于是我们便通过锦州铁路局、阜新矿务局和各有关单位协商达成协议，把西阜新车站与矿务局运输部车务段合并为阜新车站；把矿务局销售科划归运输部，运输部改为运销部；车站成立一个总支委员会，由西阜新铁路地区工委和运销部党委直接领导。工会和共青团的组织也相应的进行了合并。
    路矿运输部门合并机构，不只是一个组织机构上的措施，实际上是一次体制上的改革。它的深刻意义在于从体制上巩固了整风中获得的思想成果，根除了妨碍路矿协作的客观因素。用工人的话说就是“路矿一家了”。解决了体制上这样一个带有根本性的问题，就给路矿大协作奠定了巩固的基础，几年来一些悬而未决的问题也就迎刃而解。特别显著的是把路矿运输各个环节串连起来成为一个整体，创造性地学习并发展了骆驼营车站七大统一的先进经验，实行了运输管理上的十二统一。即：思想统一、领导统一、机构统一、产运销统一、计划统一、调度统一、班次统一、指标统一、统计统一、设备统一、信号统一、检查总结统一等。这些“统一”集中表现在统一思想，统一机构，从而统一计划和统一行动。互相罚款的规章正式废除了，路矿交接线不再是妨碍协作的鸿沟，而成为便利协作的站线，从而发挥了设备潜力，使线路通过能力由过去的三百五十辆提高到现在的八百多辆，最高曾达到九百多辆。这种体制革命是运输大协作的基础，是运输高产大面积丰收的重要因素之一。
    随着运输体制改革的实现，路矿职工群众的积极性空前高涨。市委在这个基础上就大搞群众运动，运动到哪里，哪里就发生急剧的变化，思想、组织制度和技术三方面的革命在运动中互相渗透，互为因果，像一条红线一样贯串在整个运动中。运输高产运动一开始，就遇到两种不同的思想。一种是伸手向国家要车皮，认为车皮少还能搞什么高产运动呢？害怕搞运动破坏正常秩序；另一种是发动群众向时间要车。对于各种各样的右倾保守思想，我们除组织不断地批判以外，更重要的是采取深入广泛发动群众的方法，把广大群众的革命干劲与科学分析结合起来，创造出奇迹，在事实面前，保守思想才算服输。
    去年11、12月的高产战役中，市委提出“向时间要车，一次作业时间达到六小时，为钢铁元帅准备足够的粮食而战！”指标实现了，有人却说：“一天达到六小时、五小时都好办，就是全月平均六小时不行”。今年1月份，省委在阜新召开交通运输现场会议，给群众指出了新的方向，要求在保证安全、保证重点的前提下，全月一次作业时间巩固在六小时的水平上。2月份，广大职工果然以实现全月平均六小时的成绩，得到了省委的红旗奖。3月份我们又提出：“向协作要效率，全月六小时，为达到五个半小时和日装一千二百车而奋斗”的口号。职工们响应党的号召，不断破除迷信、解放思想，一次作业时间一次比一次缩短。这样既有力地批判了保守思想，又进一步鼓舞了群众的冲天干劲。
    缩短一次作业时间与改革规章制度有十分密切的关系。阜新车站在五个月的运动中破了八百三十条陈旧的规章制度，立了七百二十三条。在破和立当中，我们掌握两条原则：一条是破束缚生产力发展的规章制度；一条是贯彻安全生产的方针。过去铁路运输的规章制度中，有一些是按“路矿两家”的原则和陈旧的技术水平制订的，这些都必须废除或修订。有破必有立，破和立是根据实际情况出发，并不一定是破一条立一条，有的是取消了，有的是修改了，有的是新建立的规章制度。如阜新站把装运煤炭的十一道工序改为五道，一次作业时间由十一点四十二分缩短到五个半小时，较旧的技术作业过程砍掉一半还多，使运输效率提高一倍。这些都是职工在分秒必争的战斗中创造出来的多快好省的工作方法，经过多次实践推广后，成为一种新的作业方法。
    协作出现“红旗列车”
    协作是社会主义生产关系的基本特征之一。路矿协作以及全市范围的大协作，大大解放了生产力，使运输工作出现空前未有的大跃进。广大煤炭装运职工在运动中创造组织“红旗列车”先进经验，是这种大协作的集中表现。“红旗列车”的特点是：统一方向、保证重点、成批装车、集中发出，减少了很多解体、集结、编组等作业过程，是在产运销统一、密切协作的基础上出现的一种新的运输组织工作形式。“红旗列车”的一次作业时间不超过四小时。五个月来的事实证明，组织“红旗列车”是缩短一次作业时间的法宝，共产主义大协作越发展，“红旗列车”开的越多；“红旗列车”的一次作业时间越短。比如，运输高产运动前没有“红旗列车”，当时的一次作业时间是十四小时以上，自从去年12月“红旗列车”出世，当月开出四十八列，全月平均一次作业是七点四小时。最近出现一次作业时间仅在一个半小时以内，最短的才五十四分钟。这样便使开“红旗列车”的经验，发展到了更高的阶段。
    “红旗列车”的出现和发展的过程，是路矿协作、产运销统一和整个装运各环节密切配合的发展、提高过程。产运销统一是组织“红旗列车”的基础。在这个基础上，产运销三个方面，根据煤炭产量和品种、销售方向和数量以及车辆运行的情况，本着保证重点供应和缩短一次作业时间的原则，进行运输组织工作。这样便减少很多解体、集结、编组的作业程序，同时再加工人的冲天干劲，于是“红旗列车”便出现了。“红旗列车”的出现，促进了各工作、各工序上下班之间更密切地协作。为了巩固和提高“红旗列车”的经验，工人们帮助调车员溜放车辆；连结员帮助装车所检查车门；制动组帮助检查组检车，以及预编、预检、徐行作业快速检斤、不停轮装车等数十种平行作业、多面手混合作业的协作方法逐步发展为制度化，现在三个作业队共同建立了五好协作制度，即：交接班前把空车配好、重车编好、材料车取送好、机车准备好、资料分析好，互相创造条件。过去是“一人一职”，忙闲不均，现在是“一人多艺”，互相帮助。这种劳动组织形式，经过提倡推广以后，从调度到工人，从东区到西区，各方面集中力量缩短一次作业时间，终于使开“红旗列车”由集中人力加班加点，变成一种正常作业的经验纳入每班的作业计划中去，巩固下来，并且有了发展。“红旗列车”成了“促进车”。它是路矿协作、路矿机构改革结下的一个硕果，反过来又促进各个环节更广泛、更密切的协作，像一条红线一样把各个环节串连起来了，从而大大地缩短了一次作业时间。
    从路矿协作到全市协作
    向时间要车的关键是向协作要效率。五个月来的经验证明，党的组织必须狠狠地抓住这一环，不断地向路矿全体职工和干部，进行共产主义大协作的思想教育。我们体会到，铁路运输工作好像一台精密完整的机器，一个部件发生故障，就会直接造成运输效率降低。因此只有路矿协作是不够的，还必须以路矿运输协作为基础，搞好装车、卸车与运输的协作，一直到全市范围的共产主义大协作。比如运动初期落地煤积存一百多万吨，如果不是市委动员全市机关干部、学生、职工家属、街道居民以及各企业单位的职工，组成五千余人的装车大军，只靠路矿本身是无法迅速将那么多的落地煤装运出去的。运输高产不仅仅是路矿协作的产物，同时也是全市大协作的结晶。协作的范围越广泛，运输高产越高涨。
    五个月来的实践证明，大搞群众运动的过程，就是不断革命的过程，也就是不断进行思想革命、组织制度上的革命和技术革命的过程。在运输高产运动中进行思想革命，破除了各色各样的迷信思想，人们的思想解放了。有了思想解放，就敢于大破大立，破了旧的体制和制度，立了新的体制和制度，这样便大大地促进了生产力的发展，从而巩固了思想革命的成果。生产力的发展，反过来又要求人们进一步解放思想，于是大搞装卸车技术革命便成为运输高产运动中的一个重要任务。目前正在修建的五个简易储煤仓落成后，可储煤三万五千多吨，对于保证煤炭生产和运输的跃进，将发生很大的作用。我们体会到，思想革命、组织制度上的革命和技术革命，三者在向时间要车、向协作要效率的群众运动中，有机地结合在一起推动着运动不断前进，这是运动发展的必然规律。这就是：每当破除一次迷信，人们的思想就解放一次；思想解放一次，产就跃进一步；生产的跃进，反过来又促进人们进一步解放思想。从而使运动一浪接一浪地不断向前发展。从煤炭生产和煤炭运输的关系上来看，最初是煤炭高产逼着运输也要高产；运输高产搞起来了，又促使煤炭产量和质量都跃进了一步，3月份达到从未有过的高峰，这又反过来又促使运输战线大闹装卸技术革命，以适应煤炭高产的需要。掌握了这种互相促进、互相制约的规律，来抓煤炭生产和运输工作，就可以达到产运协调、多产煤、多运煤的目的。
