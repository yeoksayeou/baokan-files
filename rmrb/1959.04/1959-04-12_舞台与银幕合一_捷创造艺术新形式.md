　　Stage and Screen Combined
　　Czechoslovakia Creates New Art Form
    In a newly renovated cinema in Prague, people are watching a performance on stage with a novel feeling: while a group of ballet dancers are dancing gracefully, real and magnificent factories appear in the background of the stage, misty with smoke and filled with water vapor. The pulse of industry is constantly beating.

    This is a new form created by a group of Czechoslovak artists, combining stage performance and film art. On the stage, people can also see a male ballet dancer holding a large circular screen with both hands. In the circle, there is an image of a female ballet dancer, dancing various graceful and moving dances. The two actors cooperate with each other to perform many moving plots. Sometimes, when a singer is performing a song on stage, enlarged images of the singer are projected on the screens hanging on both sides of the stage, so that the audience can see her facial expressions and gestures from the front and sides more clearly. In addition, the screen can be used to express the actor's dreams, associations, and so on, breaking the limitations of time and space in stage performances. This light show was well received by some people after it was performed at the Brussels World's Fair last year. Now, they are further researching and creating the second light show in the country, which will be staged in August. The creators of this light show believe that this invention will break new ground in people's cultural life.

　　舞台与银幕合一
　　捷创造艺术新形式
    在布拉格一座新改建的电影院里，人们带着新奇的感觉，注视着舞台上的演出：当一群芭蕾舞演员在翩翩起舞的时候，在舞台的背景上出现了真实的宏伟的工厂，烟雾蒙蒙，水气阵阵。工业的脉搏在不停地跳动。
    这是捷克斯洛伐克一批艺术家创造的、把舞台表演和电影艺术结合起来的新形式。在舞台上，人们还可以看到一个男芭蕾舞演员双手托着一个大圆盘银幕。圆盘中，有一个女芭蕾舞演员的影象，跳着各种优美动人的舞姿。两个演员互相配合着，表演出许多动人的情节。有时，当一个歌手在台上表演歌唱的时候，舞台两旁挂着的银幕上映出了这个歌手的放大形象，她正面和侧面的脸部表情和手势，观众都可以看得更加清楚。此外，还可以用银幕表现演员的梦幻、联想等等。打破舞台表演中的时间和空间限制。这种幻灯节目去年在布鲁塞尔博览会上演后，受到一些人们的好评。现在，他们正在国内进一步研究，创作第二部幻灯节目，将在8月间上演。这种幻灯节目的创造者认为这个发明将在人们的文化生活中别开生面。
