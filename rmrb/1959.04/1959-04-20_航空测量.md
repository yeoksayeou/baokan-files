　　Aerial Surveying

　　Aerial surveying is one of the basic tasks of professional aviation. According to the nature of its operations, it can be divided into two categories: aerial photography and aerial geophysical exploration.

　　The principle of aerial photography is the same as ordinary photography. As long as an aerial camera with specially designed and good photosensitive analysis performance is installed on an airplane, continuous vertical photography of the ground can be carried out along a certain survey line. The terrain of the survey area and objects on the ground can be truthfully photographed. The mountains, rivers, forests, deserts, and even gardens, villages, houses, and roads are vividly depicted, and the images are very realistic. The topographic photos taken from the plane in different zones and blocks are pieced together, and after re-photography, a detailed topographic map is obtained. From the map, the geological conditions, ground resources, and geographical features of the survey area can be accurately determined. Also, the types and distribution of underground resources can be indirectly determined according to the structure of the surface strata.

　　However, using aerial photography for surveying can only ascertain the surface conditions of the strata, and cannot directly detect underground resources. From the overall needs of national construction, it only completes half of the surveying task. In order to make up for the shortcomings of aerial photography, the method of aerial geophysical exploration has emerged.

　　There are many methods of aerial geophysical exploration, including magnetic exploration, gravity measurement, seismic measurement, etc. Currently, China mainly uses aerial magnetic surveying. We know that all substances are composed of charged atoms, and electricity and magnetism are two-in-one physical phenomena. Due to the different numbers of electrons, some substances have stronger magnetism, while others have weaker magnetism. Generally speaking, metallic materials have much stronger magnetism than non-metallic materials, especially metals such as copper and iron, which have good electrical conductivity. Aerial magnetic surveying uses the principle of magnetic induction and installs a specially made instrument on the aircraft. When the aircraft flies over a metal ore body at a certain altitude, the instrument will sense the magnetic force emitted from the underground ore body and automatically record the strength and changes of the magnetic force. This method can not only find common metal deposits but also rare metal deposits such as uranium and cobalt.

　　航空测量
    航空测量是专业航空的基本工种之一。按它作业的性质，可以分为航空摄影和航空物理勘探两类。
    航空摄影的原理和普通照像一样，只要在飞机上装一架经过特别设计的、感光分析性能很好的航空照像机，沿着一定的测线对地面进行垂直的连续摄影，就可以把测区的地形，地上的东西如实地照下来，地面的山水林木、沙漠原野，以至田园村舍、房屋道路都历历如绘，影像十分真切。把从飞机上分区、分块拍摄下来的地形照片镶辑在一起，经过复照，便是一幅详明的地形图。从图上可以正确地判明测区的地质情况、地面资源和地理特征，还可以根据地层表面的结构，间接地判断出地下资源的种类和分布情况。
    但是，用航空摄影的方法进行测量，只能查明地层表面的情况，不能直接探知地下资源，从国家建设的全面需要来看，只算完成了测量任务的一半。为了弥补航空摄影的不足，于是又产生了航空物理勘探的方法。
    航空物理勘探的方法很多，有磁性勘探、重力测量、地震测量等等。我国目前采用的主要是航空磁测，我们知道，各种物质都是由带电的原子组成的，而电和磁是二位一体的物理现象。由于电子数量不等，有些物质的磁性较强，有些物质的磁性就较弱。一般地说，金属物比非金属物的磁性要强得多，特别是铜、铁等具有良好的导电性能的金属。航空磁测就是利用磁性感应的原理，在飞机上装一部特制的仪器。当飞机在一定的高度上飞过金属矿的时候，仪器便会感受到从地下矿体发出来的磁力，并且自动地把磁力强弱和变化情况记录下来。用这种方法不仅能找到普遍的金属矿藏，还能找到铀、钴等稀有金属的矿藏。
