    A Casual Discussion of Translation
    Zhou Jianren
  Some time ago, I saw an article by Comrade Zhang Zhongshi in the People's Daily, mainly discussing how the old translations of "按劳取酬" (àn láo qǔ chóu) and "各取所需" (gè qǔ suǒ xū) did not conform to the original meaning and should be re-translated as "按劳分配" (àn láo fēn pèi) and "按需分配" (àn xū fēn pèi) to be more in line with the original meaning. I also remember that he encouraged others to offer suggestions on old translations.

    After reading this article, I have a small opinion.

    Since ancient times, there has been an irreconcilable contradiction between Chinese spoken language and Chinese characters. Spoken language requires more syllables so that the meaning can be distinguished clearly, otherwise it is difficult to distinguish. Because Chinese characters are troublesome to write, it is necessary to try to write as few characters as possible. Sometimes even the three characters of "图书馆" (tú shū guǎn - library) are reduced to one character "圕" (tuǎn). The two characters "问题" (wèn tí - question) are reduced to one character "?" And there are others, which need not be listed. This makes the divergence between written language and spoken language greater and greater.

    To solve this contradiction, it is necessary to use letters for spelling, and there is no other way. Pinyin letters are very simple and easy to write, and it doesn't hurt to write a few more. If you use a typewriter, it is even more convenient. In the future, the written language and spoken language will have great developments. The number of syllables will increase, and the meaning will become clearer and more precise. There is no doubt about this.

    From the above point of view, the use of nouns today must take into account the convenience of pinyinization, and not only seek to simplify Chinese characters. For example, the character "劳" (láo - labor) has many usages. Adding the character "动" (dòng - action) to become "劳动" (láo dòng - labor) can express a clear meaning. The character "需" (xū - need) is even more inseparable from the character "要" (yào - want). The meaning of the two characters "需要" (xū yào - need) is very clear, and it is not very clear to use only one character "需". (In classical Chinese, "所需" - suǒ xū - what is needed is also easy to understand, but in spoken and vernacular Chinese, "需要" - xū yào - is mostly used). I think it is important to have a clear meaning here, and there is no need to adhere to the previous four-character translation method. Translating it as "按劳动分配" (àn láo dòng fēn pèi - according to labor distribution) and "按需要分配" (àn xū yào fēn pèi - according to need distribution) feels closer to spoken language. This also takes into account the convenience of pinyin characters.

    I also thought of several book title translations, so I will say a few words about them here. Engels' "Anti-Dühring" was originally called "Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science", and Lenin once wrote it as "Anti-Dühring." When the German Democratic Republic reprinted this book, it retained the original name and added the name "Anti-Dühring" in parentheses below. I think this is appropriate. As for the character "论" (lùn - on), if the original text has the meaning of this character (such as zur or on), it should be added; if not, there is no need to add it. In Chinese characters, in addition to poetry, lyrics, songs and赋, there are also many titles such as 论, 义, 疏, 策, etc. There is really no need to apply them in translations.

    Also, Marx wrote "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte", which was once translated into Chinese as "拿破仑第三政变记" (Ná pò lún dì sān zhèng biàn jì - Napoleon III's Coup d'état Record). I also don't think it is necessary to translate it. People who read classical works will also understand the original name, so there is no need to change it. When using pinyin letters to spell it, Louis Bonaparte can be written directly in the original text. This also shows that not rewriting has its advantages.

    Also, Engels' "The Housing Question" started from "housing shortage". Understanding the meaning of the text means discussing "the problem of living in houses." The English translation translates "住宅" (zhù zhái - residence) as "Housing," which is very useful for reference, and the meaning also refers to "living in houses." This can also be studied. Speaking of which, some past Chinese translations were influenced by Japanese translations. For example, umbrella is very familiar to everyone, and the ancient character "繖" (sǎn) has long been unused; but the "umbellate inflorescence" in botany is like an umbrella unfolded. A few years ago, botanical books still wrote "繖形花序" (sǎn xíng huā xù), instead of using the familiar character "伞" (sǎn - umbrella). This comes from Japan. Young students find it very difficult to remember and understand the character "繖", but it is easy to remember and understand if you use the character "伞". There is a need to check the translation names.

    Earlier, I saw an English translation of Bebel's "Woman and Socialism," and the title of the book was changed to "Woman in the Past, Present, and Future." I don't think this translation is good.

    Should the titles of various translations not be changed? I haven't thought about it comprehensively, so I can't answer, but at least the original meaning of classical works should be preserved as much as possible, and it is necessary not to change it.

    漫谈译名
    周建人
  前一些时候，我从人民日报上看到一篇张仲实同志写的文章，主要是讲旧译文里译的“按劳取酬”和“各取所需”不符合原意，应当改译为“按劳分配”和“按需分配”更合原意。并且记得他还鼓励别人对旧译文可以提些意见。
    我看了这文章以后，有一点小意见。
    自来中国的口语与汉字有着一个不可调和的矛盾。口语需要音节多，听起来意思才分辨得清楚，少则分辨不清楚。因汉字书写麻烦，须力求少写些字。有时甚至把图书馆三字缩成“圕”一个字。把问题二字缩成“?”一个字。还有别的，不必列举。这样，使文字与口语的分歧愈来愈大了。
    要解决这矛盾，非用字母来拼写不可，没有别的道路。拼音字母很简单易写，多写几个无妨碍。如用打字机，更加方便了。以后，文字与口语将大有发展。音节会加多，意义会进于更清楚与精密。这是毫无疑义的。
    从上述的道理说来，今日使用名词须得照顾拼音化的方便，不要单求简省汉字。比方“劳”字，有许多用法，加上动字，成为劳动，才能表示一种明确的意思。“需”字更离不开“要”字。“需要”二字的意思很明确，单用一个需字是不大明白的（文言里“所需”也容易懂，但在口语与白话文里大都用“需要”的）。我以为这里应以意义明确为重要，不必拘泥于以前的四字句的译法了。译为“按劳动分配”，和“按需要分配”，觉得更接近口语些。这样，也照顾了拼音字的方便。
    还连带想到几个书名的译法，这里顺便说一说。恩格斯的“反杜林论”原本叫作“杜林先生的科学革命”，列宁曾经把它写成“反杜林”。德意志民主共和国重印这书时，把原名保留着，下面括弧里加上“反杜林”这名称。我觉得这样做是妥当的。至于“论”字，如原文有此字的意义（如前面有zur，或on字样的），应当加，如没有，就没有加上的必要了。中国文字里除诗词歌赋之外，还有什么论，义，疏，策，等等，名目繁多。在译文里实在没有套用的必要。
    又如马克思写的“鲁懿·波那巴脱雾月二十八”，中国文曾改译为“拿破仑第三政变记”。我也觉得没有把它改译的必要。会看经典著作的人，原来的名字也会懂得的，所以不需要改。如用拼音字母来拼写时，鲁懿·波那巴脱，直接写原文也就可以了。这也就说明不改写有它的便利处。
    还有，恩格斯的“论住宅问题”，是从“房荒”讲起的。体会文字的意思，是在讨论“住房子的问题”。英文译本里把“住宅”译作“Housing”，很可供参考，意思也是指“住房子”。这也可以研究一下的。话说远了，过去中国译文受日本译名的影响的也有。例如伞子，大家已很熟识，繖字这古字早已不用了；而植物学上的“伞形花序”，本是像伞子张开的样子的，前几年植物学书上还看到写着“繖形花序”，不用伞字这个熟识的字。这就是从日本来的。年幼的学生，繖字很不容易记得和懂得，如用伞字就容易记得懂得了。译名上有检查一下的必要的。
    早先我看到一本倍倍尔的“妇女与社会主义”的英文译本，书名改为“妇女的过去、现在与将来”。我以为不要这样译法为好。
    是否各种译本的书名都不应改变？我却没有全面想过，答不上来，但至少经典著作应当竭力保存原意，不要改变它，是有这必要的。
