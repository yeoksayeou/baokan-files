Xinhua News Agency, 12th — The Ministry of Communications convened an expanded national teleconference on transportation on the 10th, to promote a wider and deeper development of the mass movement on the national water, land, and air transportation fronts.

　　Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Zeng Shan, Minister of the Communications Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered important speeches at the meeting. Wang Shoudao, Minister of the Ministry of Communications, and Vice Minister Pan Qi also spoke at the meeting. They proposed that the mass movement carried out by the transportation departments should be centered on increasing production and practicing economy and technical revolution, with the goal of improving labor productivity, accelerating the turnover of transportation equipment, and increasing transportation capacity, so as to ensure the completion of the transportation tasks for key materials, and strive to complete the transportation tasks for general materials. They put forward specific requirements to the water, land, and air aspects of the transportation front, respectively. In terms of water transport, carry out the "Six Comparisons Red Banner Competition" movement centered on tapping potential, shortening the berthing time of ships in ports, and accelerating the turnover of ships. The "Six Comparisons" are: comparing high yield, comparing high quality, comparing safety, comparing economy, comparing technological reform, and comparing cooperation. In terms of highway transportation, motor vehicle transportation is to fully carry out the movement of "safety, economy, and 10,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton per month"; civil transportation is to strive to double transport capacity, realize the multi-wheeling and train-formation of horse-drawn carts, the ball-bearing and rubberizing of existing vehicles, the troughing and cableway of mountain transportation, the rail-tracking of fixed transportation, and the semi-mechanization of loading and unloading operations. In terms of civil aviation, take safe flight as the key, strengthen business management, improve technical level, and improve service quality.

　　In the first quarter of this year, the transportation front has already won the first battle. The amount of transportation completed by the national water, land, and air transportation departments increased by 70% compared with the same period last year. In order to complete and over fulfill the transportation tasks for the second quarter and the whole year, the transportation departments in various regions have formulated conditions and specific measures to further carry out the competition. At the teleconference, the responsible cadres of the transportation departments of various provinces and cities and the representatives of key transportation enterprises put forward their specific goals, responded to the call of the leaders, and launched competitions with each other.

　　Du Shixing, Deputy Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Transportation, challenged other provinces with the following main indicators: First, in terms of automobiles, the average carrying capacity per vehicle will be doubled compared with last year, saving 12,000 tons of gasoline, and one vehicle with one trailer will be achieved within this year. Second, the tonnage of wooden boats will be increased by half compared with last year. Third, 100,000 tons of new wooden sailboats, 200,000 tons of improved wooden sailboats, and 100 new motorized sailboats will be built. Fourth, every people's commune will have a professional transportation team.

　　Wang Jifen, Acting Director of the Shanghai Transportation Bureau, proposed the following competition conditions to the national motor vehicle transportation workers: First, strengthen transportation organization and management, and under the principle of ensuring key points and taking general considerations into account, ensure that stations and ports are not blocked and factories and construction sites do not stop work due to untimely motor vehicle transportation. Second, make great efforts in technical revolution, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading will reach 50% within the year, the ratio of trailers to existing vehicles will reach 1:2.3 according to tonnage, save gasoline, reduce 20% compared with the national quota, and reduce unit cost by 27% compared with last year.

　　Lu Zhengzhe, Director of the Beijing Administration Bureau of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, proposed the following main competition conditions to the brother civil aviation administration bureaus: First, ensure flight safety, and do a more detailed and accurate job in flight management, dispatch, meteorology, aircraft maintenance, communications and navigation. Second, over fulfill the tasks of transport aviation, industrial aviation, and agricultural aviation with good quality.

　　Fang Zaiying, Deputy County Chief of Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, challenged the national people's communes at the meeting to run the people's commune transportation team well. This county has already found a new way for people's communes to run transportation and has achieved great results. The conditions they put forward are: First, the number of vehicles in each permanent professional transportation team in the county should reach 250, and the number of vehicles in the reserve transportation team should reach 3,000; to ensure that the commune has a professional transportation team, the management area has a professional transportation vehicle, and the production team has a reserve transportation group, so as to ensure the completion of short-distance transportation tasks between the county and the commune, and between the commune and the management area. Second, all animal-powered vehicles in the county will be ball-bearing and rubber-wheeled this year. Third, do a good job in connecting trunk lines and short-distance transportation, so that the car-ton-month output will reach an average of 13,000 ton-kilometers throughout the year, based on more than 10,000 ton-kilometers in the first quarter.

　　Xie Limin, Deputy Director of the Changjiang River Shipping Administration Bureau, put forward their measures to deepen the mass movement. The main measures are to shorten the berthing time of ships; to carry out extensive cooperation to break through weak links; to improve transportation organization to make it balanced and connected; to tow more and run faster to improve turnover rate; to ensure safe production and eliminate accidents; to shorten the repair period and allow ships to leave the factory ahead of schedule; and to focus on ship stowage to make full use of tonnage.

　　Zhang Hui, Director of the Inland Waterway Navigation Bureau of the Hunan Provincial Department of Transportation, introduced at the meeting the experience of Hunan Province in improving enterprise management and carrying out the Red Banner competition with ship operation as the key, and proposed to strive to complete this year's national transportation plan one month ahead of schedule.

　　An Lifu, Chairman of the Highway Transportation Trade Union, and Liu Dachao, Chairman of the Seamen's Trade Union, also spoke at the meeting.
