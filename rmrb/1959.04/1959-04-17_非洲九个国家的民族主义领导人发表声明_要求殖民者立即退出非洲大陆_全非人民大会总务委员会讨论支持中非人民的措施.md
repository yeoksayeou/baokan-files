Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 15th - A conference of African nationalist leaders to celebrate "African Freedom Day" was held here today.

Attending the conference were representatives from nine African countries, including Algeria, Zanzibar, South Africa, Kenya, Cameroon, Somaliland, Uganda, Nigeria, and Eritrea. Diplomatic envoys from some countries in Cairo also attended the meeting.

The conference passed three statements, one resolution, and telegrams to the colonial ministers of five countries: Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal, and Italy.

The statement on "African Freedom Day" pointed out that this day has great historical significance and will impact the African people's struggle for freedom. This day encourages the united front of all African freedom fighters to establish a consistent goal. They declared this day as the day for African people to get rid of the shackles of colonialism and called for universal acceptance of this day as a symbol of solidarity with the African people's struggle for freedom.

A resolution passed by the conference stated, "The conference unanimously resolves: to condemn all forms and manifestations of colonialism and imperialism; to condemn economic exploitation and political oppression, as well as the heinous atrocities and massacres committed by imperialism against the African people."

The resolution stated, "Noting the determination of Africans to continue the struggle until complete freedom is achieved, reaffirming the inherent rights of all African people from Cape Town to Cairo, from Guinea to Zanzibar, to sovereignty and national independence, and demanding that Asian, African, and all freedom-loving countries exert pressure on colonial countries through the United Nations to compel them to relinquish colonies, protectorates, and trust territories before April 14, 1960."

The resolution affirmed that Africans are the masters of their own continent and demanded that "colonialists who are now completely relying on force to rule Africa immediately hand over power and withdraw from the African continent."

The resolution called on freedom-loving people around the world to use all their strength to end the evil colonial system and imperialist system.

The statement on the situation in Central Africa passed by the conference said that the conference was deeply indignant upon hearing of the brutal and barbaric treatment and massacres of the people of Nyasaland. The conference "strongly demands that the people of Nyasaland be given the right to self-determination, that Dr. Banda and his comrades be released immediately as the first step towards this goal, and resolutely opposes the rule of Southern Rhodesia by a white minority hegemony."

The statement added: "The conference reiterates that the only self-government acceptable to Africans is self-government based on democratic universal suffrage."

The statement on Jomo Kenyatta passed by the conference said that the conference was extremely indignant upon hearing that after the release of Kenyan African leader Kenyatta from prison, the Kenyan government continued to make decisions that would permanently restrict his freedom of movement. The conference hereby lodges the strongest protest with the British colonial government and requests the British Parliament and the United Nations Human Rights Commission to secure Kenyatta's release.

During the conference, representatives, in their speeches, strongly condemned colonial rule, expressed their determination to fight for national independence, and emphasized the unity of Africans.

The telegrams sent by the conference to the colonial ministers of five countries, Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal, and Italy, notified these colonial countries that "the African people are unwavering in their determination to get rid of the shackles of colonialism" and demanded that they learn the lessons of history and recognize the right of all African people to independence. The telegrams also demanded an immediate end to the colonial war in Algeria.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th - Conakry Dispatch: The emergency meeting of the General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference opened on the 15th in Conakry, the capital of the Republic of Guinea.

Outside the venue, signs were erected with slogans written in English and French: "Africa is for Africans," "Get out of Africa."

According to the permanent secretariat of the All-African People's Conference, this meeting will discuss the events that recently occurred in the Belgian Congo and Nyasaland during the climax of the anti-colonial struggle, in order to decide what effective actions to take to support the struggle of the people in these regions for independence and freedom.

Guinean Prime Minister Sékou Touré delivered the opening speech at the first day's public meeting, criticizing the colonial policies of old colonial powers such as Britain, France, Belgium, and Portugal in Africa, and emphasized the importance of African people uniting in the struggle for independence and freedom.

Touré said that Africa does not participate in any camp or any group, but Africa must pay attention to external forces that are beneficial or detrimental to it. He said, we must clearly understand which countries support African independence and which countries support maintaining colonialism.

Touré condemned France's smear campaign against Guinea in the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He emphasized that Africa sees no difference between the colonial rule of France, Belgium, Britain, or Portugal.

He also said that Africa is a human society of 200 million people subjected to exploitation and disastrous enslavement, and its demands can only be expressed by itself.

He said, "We must strengthen the natural unity that binds us together through the following methods: unified action and thought, coordinating purposes and means, universally promoting our best methods, more frequently exchanging our experiences, taking consistent action, and constantly strengthening our strength and increasing our vigilance."

Attending the opening meeting were representatives from Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Southern Rhodesia, Ethiopia, Basutoland, French Cameroon, and the Belgian Congo. This emergency meeting was originally scheduled to begin a few days ago but was postponed due to the failure of some representatives to arrive on schedule.

    新华社开罗15日电　为庆祝“非洲自由日”的非洲民族主义领导人会议今天在这里举行。
    出席会议的有阿尔及利亚、桑给巴尔、南非、怯尼亚、喀麦隆、索马里兰、乌干达、尼日利亚和厄立特里亚等九个非洲国家的代表。在开罗的一些国家的外交使节也列席了会议。
    会议通过了三项声明，一项决议，以及致英、法、比利时、葡萄牙、意大利五国殖民地部长的电报。
    关于“非洲自由日”的声明指出，这个日子具有伟大的历史意义，将对非洲人民争取自由的斗争发生影响。这个日子鼓舞着全非自由战士阵线树立一致的目标。他们宣布这一天是非洲人民摆脱殖民主义枷锁的日子，并且号召普遍接受这一天作为声援非洲人民争取自由权利的标志。
    会议通过的一项决议说，“会议一致决议：谴责一切形式和表现的殖民主义和帝国主义；谴责经济剥削和政治压制以及帝国主义对非洲人民的罪恶滔天的暴行和屠杀”。
    决议说，“注意到非洲人要继续斗争直到获得完全的自由为止的决心，重申从开普敦到开罗、从几内亚到桑给巴尔的一切非洲人民对主权和民族独立的固有的权利，并且要求亚非国家和所有爱好自由的国家通过联合国对殖民主义国家施加压力，以便使它们在1960年4月14日以前放弃殖民地、保护地和托管地”。
    决议肯定非洲人是他们自己大陆的主人，并且要求“现在完全依靠武力统治非洲的殖民主义者立即交出权力和退出非洲大陆”。
    决议呼吁全世界争取自由的人们，以他们全部力量来结束罪恶的殖民制度和帝国主义制度。
    会议通过的关于中非局势的声明说，会议听到尼亚萨兰人民遭到凶恶的野蛮对待和屠杀时深感愤慨。会议“强烈要求给尼亚萨兰人以自决权，要求立即释放班达博士和他的同志们，作为走向这个目的的第一步，并且断然反对少数白种霸权分子对南罗得西亚的统治”。
    声明又说：“会议重申，非洲人唯一能接受的自治是以民主的普遍选举权为基础的自治”。
    会议通过的关于乔莫·肯雅塔的声明说，会议在听到在怯尼亚非洲人领袖肯雅塔被释放出狱以后，怯尼亚政府继续作出了永远限制他的行动自由的决定以后，感到极为愤慨。会议为此向英国殖民地政府提出最强烈的抗议，并且要求英国议会和联合国人权委员会使肯雅塔获得释放。
    在会议上，代表们在发言中，强烈谴责殖民统治，表示争取民族独立的决心，并且强调非洲人的团结。
    会议打给英、法、比、葡、意五国殖民地部长的电报通知这些殖民主义国家说，“非洲人民坚定不移地决心要摆脱殖民主义枷锁”，要求他们吸取历史的教训，承认全非人民独立的权利。电报还要求立即停止对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争。
    新华社16日讯　科纳克里消息：全非人民大会总务委员会紧急会议15日在几内亚共和国首都科纳克里开幕。
    在会场外，竖立着用英文和法文书写的“非洲是非洲人的”、“滚出非洲去”的标语牌。
    据全非人民大会常设秘书处早先宣布，这次会议将讨论前不久在比属刚果和尼亚萨兰反殖民主义斗争高潮中所发生的事件，以决定采取什么有效的行动来支持这些地区人民争取独立和自由的斗争。
    几内亚总理塞古·杜尔在第一天的公开会议上致开幕词，抨击了英、法、比利时和葡萄牙等老牌殖民主义国家在非洲的殖民政策，并且强调了非洲人民在争取独立、自由的斗争中团结一致的重要意义。
    杜尔说，非洲不参加任何阵营和任何集团，但非洲必须重视对它有利和不利的外部力量。他说，我们必须明确了解那些国家支持非洲独立和那些国家支持维护殖民主义。
    杜尔谴责了法国在联合国和北大西洋公约组织中对几内亚进行的诬蔑运动。他强调指出，非洲认为法国、比利时、英国或者葡萄牙的殖民统治之间没有任何区别。
    他还说，非洲是一个二亿人受剥削和灾难性奴役的人类社会，它的要求只能由它自己来表达。
    他说，“我们必须通过下列办法加强把我们联系在一起的天然团结：统一的行动和思想，使目的和手段协调一致，普遍推行我们最好的办法，更加经常地交流我们的经验，采取一致行动，不断地加强力量和提高警惕。”
    出席开幕会议的有加纳、几内亚、利比里亚、南罗得西亚、埃塞俄比亚、巴苏陀兰、法属喀麦隆和比属刚果的代表。这次紧急会议原定在前几天开始举行，由于一些代表没有能如期赶到而延期开幕。
