　　Castor Can Prevent Insects
    Castor has many uses and is a crop with high economic value. Usually, people only know that its seeds can be pressed for oil and its leaves can be used to feed silkworms. In fact, castor has another very important use, which is to prevent and control insects.
    Planting castor around tree nurseries can prevent insects. At the same time as sowing seeds in the nursery, beside the drainage ditches in the nursery plot and around the entire nursery area, sow three to five castor seeds every three to five feet apart. After that, it does not require much management to grow well and does not affect the development of seedlings. In this way, the nursery can generally be protected from pests throughout the year, and the agents and labor used to prevent underground pests from harming the seedlings after they emerge from the soil can also be saved. When a large number of scarab beetles (one of the major forest pests) appear, these pests are greedy for castor leaves and do not harm the trees. After eating castor leaves, they are poisoned to death. Therefore, the planting of more castor should be particularly promoted in nurseries and forest areas. On the one hand, it can achieve the effect of preventing and controlling insects, and on the other hand, it can also harvest a large number of castor seeds and castor stalks. In addition, it may be worthwhile to experiment with planting castor on the edges of farmland to prevent insects.

　　蓖麻可以防虫
    蓖麻有多种用途，是经济价值很高的一种作物。平常人们只知道它的籽可以榨油，叶可以喂蚕。其实蓖麻还有一个很重要的用处，就是可以防虫、治虫。
    将蓖麻种在树木苗圃的四周，就可以防虫。在苗圃播种的同时，于苗圃小区排水沟旁和整个苗圃区的四周，每隔三至五尺远，点播三粒到五粒蓖麻籽，以后不需怎样管理，就能很好地生长；并且不影响苗木的发育。这样，一般可以使苗圃全年免受害虫的危害，还可以省去苗木出土后为防止地下害虫对苗木的危害所用的药剂和劳动力。当大量出现金龟子（森林大害虫之一）时，这种害虫又贪吃蓖麻的叶，而不去危害树木。吃了蓖麻叶以后，即被毒死。因此在苗圃和林区，特别应提倡多种植蓖麻。一方面可以达到防虫、治虫的效果，另一方面还可以收获大量蓖麻籽和蓖麻秆。此外，在农田边，种植蓖麻防虫，也不妨试验一下。
