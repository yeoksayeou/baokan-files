The Hungarian people will celebrate the fourteenth anniversary of their liberation on April 4th. Fourteen years ago, on April 4, 1945, the glorious Soviet army completely wiped out the fascist German bandits on Hungarian soil, and also shattered the shackles of rule by the upper classes that had forced Hungarian laborers into oppression, powerlessness, and poverty for hundreds of years, creating conditions for the Hungarian working people to master and control their own destiny. From that day on, our working people opened a new page in history. Therefore, April 4th has become our greatest national holiday.

For hundreds of years, the Hungarian people have waged heroic and resolute struggles against external enemies and domestic reactionaries. Each time, these struggles were strangled by the combined forces of domestic and foreign reactionary forces. This was the case in 1848-1849, and again in 1919. Forty years ago, for the first time on the stage of Hungarian social life, there appeared a force that could serve as the heir and the sole successor to the Hungarian revolutionary tradition, and victoriously realize the just cause of millions of Hungarian laborers. This force is the Communist Party. The twenty-five years of frenzied terror rule by Horthy fascism failed to destroy the power of the Marxist-Leninist vanguard of our working class. How should we cherish the freedom given by the Soviet army that liberated our country—the Party often educates the people in this way. After liberation, our country embarked on the path of people's democracy under relatively peaceful conditions. Land, factories, banks, and domestic and foreign trade all became the property of the people. And this backward agricultural country, which was plundered and severely damaged in the war, has, in just ten years under the leadership of the Communist Party, become an industrial and agricultural country on the road to prosperity. Less than twenty years ago, some called Hungary, with a population of ten million, "the country of three million beggars," and this statement was very true. Now, unemployment has been completely eliminated. Workers believe in their future. In order to improve the cultural level of the broad masses of people, a cultural revolution has been launched. The children of the working people have mastered the schools that were previously monopolized by the privileged classes.

Of course, if we were not a member of the big family of nations building socialism, then no matter what, we could not guarantee such a high rate of development. The international significance of Hungary's April 4th National Day is reflected here. When our people, under the leadership of the Party, embarked on the road of socialist construction, for the first time in its history, it immediately found the most loyal, selfless, and willing friends to help us. We have also experienced a historically significant development process together with the socialist brother countries, namely, the formation of the socialist world system. Following the world's first socialist country, the Soviet Union, we and the people of many brother countries have successively embarked on the road of socialism, and we are proud to be able to advance in the ranks of countries building advanced social systems.

This is why the foundation of the foreign policy of the Hungarian People's Republic is the rock-solid friendship and comprehensive cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist brother countries.

We say that we admire and love the people and leaders of socialist countries as much as we admire and love our own brothers—is this a bit too much? No! Not long ago, we shattered the centuries-old system of exploitation in our country and began to establish a new and only rational social system in a country that had been turned into ruins. Perhaps this is why we can most deeply understand the brotherly love of the socialist camp, and the great Chinese people within the socialist camp, for us. After 1945, like in 1919, the efforts of our liberated people aroused the frenzied hatred of the imperialists and their running dogs in Hungary. In 1956, they pounced on the people and the Party of our motherland like bloodthirsty beasts, attempting to eliminate our socialist achievements and to restore the capitalist system in Hungary.

A Hungarian proverb says: "A friend in need is a friend indeed." The counter-revolutionary conspiracies of the imperialists and the revisionist traitors who served them not only encountered the strength of the finest sons and daughters of the Hungarian people, but also the strength of the entire socialist camp, and ultimately suffered a shameful defeat. In order to crush the counter-revolutionary rebellion and revive the motherland, the Hungarian people received from you more help than a general friend could give. Only true brothers can provide such help to each other. When Comrade Zhou Enlai visited our country shortly after the counter-revolution was suppressed, he saw with his own eyes the damage caused to us by the evil events instigated by imperialism. At the same time, he could also appreciate the soaring enthusiasm and iron-like determination shown by the Hungarian Communists in victoriously realizing the socialist cause in the face of all conspiracies, acts of treason, and imperialist attempts at interference.

These days we are particularly honored because we have the opportunity to welcome here the Chinese people's representatives led by Comrade Zhu De, whom we love. What makes us even happier is that we have the opportunity to ask them to convey our greetings to the Chinese people, who have achieved great achievements through selfless and heroic labor, and to tell them that, relying on the help of the brother peoples, we have restored our country, and the Hungarian working people are more closely united around their Marxist-Leninist Party than ever before. We are very happy to be able to tell the representatives of the Chinese people that our working class, working peasants, and progressive intellectuals are making joint efforts to accelerate the socialist construction of our country and to make up for the backwardness caused by the counter-revolution in the development of industry and agriculture and the improvement of cultural levels.

The tasks before us are still not small, and we cannot yet say that we have overcome all difficulties. However, on April 4, 1959, the Hungarian working class will launch a warm labor competition to greet the Party Congress to be held this autumn, and our peasants will take the road of socialist cooperation more rapidly, that is to say, all our working people will greet the fourteenth anniversary of our liberation with a strong confidence in the future and with the mood inspired by the grand prospects of socialist development. As this festival approaches, every Hungarian worker can feel the heartstrings of nine hundred million brothers beating. This makes our people even more able to give full play to their enormous creativity to ensure the complete realization of their goals. In celebrating this festival, the Hungarian people once again solemnly announce that we will fight resolutely and unremittingly, in solidarity with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, against imperialism attempting to launch a new war, and against revisionism attempting to split the international workers' movement.

On April 4th, the Hungarian people express warm and fraternal congratulations to all the Chinese working people! Congratulations on their new and great achievements in socialist construction! The Hungarian people regard all the achievements of the Chinese people as their own achievements, and answer the proletarian internationalist assistance of the People's Republic of China to the Hungarian working people during the Hungarian counter-revolutionary events with unforgettable gratitude.

Let the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples last forever!

    匈牙利人民获得解放的节日
    匈牙利人民共和国工农革命政府外交部部长　西克·安德烈博士
    匈牙利人民将在4月4日庆祝自己解放的十四周年。十四年前，1945年4月4日，光荣的苏联军队在匈牙利国土上彻底消灭了法西斯德国匪帮，同时也粉碎了迫使匈牙利劳动者几百年以来沦于被压迫、无权和贫困状态的上层分子的统治锁链，给匈牙利劳动人民创造了掌握和支配自己命运的条件。从这天起，我国劳动人民揭开了历史的新页。因此，4月4日成为我们最伟大的国庆节。
    几百年以来，匈牙利人民对外部敌人和国内反动派曾进行了英勇的坚决的斗争。这些斗争每次都被国内外反动势力的联合力量所扼杀了。1848—1849年是这样，1919年也是这样。四十年前，在匈牙利社会生活的舞台上，第一次出现了能够作为匈牙利革命传统的和唯一的继承者的、胜利地实现千百万匈牙利劳动者的正义事业的力量。这个力量就是共产主义的政党。霍尔蒂法西斯主义二十五年的疯狂的恐怖统治，也没有能够摧毁我国工人阶级的马克思列宁主义先锋队的力量。应当怎样珍惜解放我国的苏联军队所给予的自由——党经常这样教育人民。解放以后，我国在比较和平的条件下走上了人民民主的道路。土地、工厂、银行以及对内对外贸易都变成了人民的财产。而这个被掠夺的、在战争中损失严重的落后农业国家，在短短的十年当中，在共产党的领导下，变成了走上繁荣道路的工农业国。还不到二十年前，有人把拥有一千万人口的匈牙利叫做“三百万乞丐的国家”，而这个说法是很有道理的。现在，失业现象根本被消灭了。劳动者相信自己的未来。为了提高广大人民群众的文化水平，掀起了文化革命。劳动人民的子女们掌握了过去为特权阶级所垄断的学校。
    当然，我们如果不是建设社会主义的各国人民大家庭的一个成员，那么我们不管怎样，也不能保证这么高速度的发展。匈牙利4月4日国庆节的国际意义就在这里体现了出来。当我国人民在党的领导下走上社会主义建设的道路时，它在自己历史上第一次立即找到了最忠诚无私和最愿意帮助我们的朋友。我们也同社会主义兄弟国家一起经历了一个具有历史意义的发展过程，即社会主义世界体系形成的过程。继世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联之后，我们和许多兄弟国家的人民，先后走上了社会主义道路，并为我们能够在建设高级社会制度的国家行列里进军而感到骄傲。
    这就是为什么匈牙利人民共和国对外政策的基础，是同苏联、中华人民共和国以及所有社会主义兄弟国家的磐石般的友谊和全面合作。
    我们说，我们敬佩和热爱社会主义各国人民及其领袖，像敬佩和热爱我们自己的兄弟一样——这是不是有一点太过份了呢？不！不久以前，我们在我们的国家里粉碎了几百年来的剥削制度，并在一个变成一片废墟的国家里，开始建立新的唯一合理的社会制度，可能这就是我们能最深刻地了解社会主义阵营以及在社会主义阵营之内的伟大中国人民对我们兄弟般的热爱的原因。1945年以后，像1919年一样，解放了的我国人民的努力，引起帝国主义者及其在匈牙利走狗的疯狂的仇恨。他们在1956年像嗜血的野兽一样地向我们祖国的人民和党猛扑过来，企图消灭我国社会主义的成就，并且企图使资本主义制度在匈牙利复辟。
    匈牙利俗语说：“患难中见朋友”。帝国主义者和为他们服务的修正主义叛徒的反革命阴谋，不仅碰到了匈牙利人民最优秀的儿女的力量，而且也碰到了整个社会主义阵营的力量，并且最后遭到了可耻的失败。为了粉碎反革命叛乱，为了复兴祖国，匈牙利人民从你们那里所得到的帮助，超过了一般朋友所能给予的援助。只有真正的亲兄弟才能互相提供这样的帮助。当周恩来同志在反革命被镇压下去以后不久来到我国访问时，他亲眼看到由帝国主义所策动的罪恶事件给我们造成的损失。同时，他也能体会到，匈牙利共产党员为反对一切阴谋活动和卖国行为以及帝国主义一切干涉企图，在胜利地实现社会主义事业方面所表现出来的冲天热情和铁一般的决心。
    这几天我们特别感到荣幸，因为我们有机会在这里欢迎我们所热爱的、由朱德同志率领的中国人民代表们。使我们更加高兴的是，我们有机会请他们向以忘我的英勇劳动，而取得伟大成就的中国人们传达我们的问候，并告诉他们：我们依靠各兄弟人民的帮助，已经恢复了我们的国家，而且匈牙利劳动人民比过去任何时候更加紧密地团结在自己的马克思列宁主义的党的周围。我们很高兴能告诉中国人民的代表们：我们的工人阶级、劳动农民和进步的知识分子正在作出共同的努力，来加速我国社会主义的建设，来弥补在发展工农业和提高文化水平方面为反革命所造成的落后局面。
    摆在我们面前的任务还不小，我们还不能说已经克服了一切困难。但是，在1959年4月4日，匈牙利工人阶级将以为迎接今年秋天召开党代表大会而展开的热烈的劳动竞赛，我国农民将以更迅速地走上社会主义合作化的道路，也就是说，我国全体劳动人民将以对未来的坚强信心和为社会主义发展宏伟远景所鼓舞的心情来迎接我国解放的十四周年。在这个节日来临的时候，每一个匈牙利劳动者都能感觉到九亿兄弟的心弦都在跳动。这就使得我国人民更能发挥巨大的创造力，来保证彻底实现自己的奋斗目标。在庆祝这个节日的时候，匈牙利人民再一次庄严地宣布，我们将同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致，为反对企图发动新战争的帝国主义，为反对企图分裂国际工人运动的修正主义而进行坚决不懈的斗争。
    匈牙利人民在4月4日向全体中国劳动人民表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺！祝贺他们在社会主义建设方面获得新的伟大的成就！匈牙利人民把中国人民的一切成就看作是自己的成就，并以永不忘怀的感激心情回答中华人民共和国在匈牙利反革命事件期间给匈牙利劳动人民的无产阶级国际主义的援助。
    让中匈人民牢不可破的友谊和合作万古长青！（附图片）
