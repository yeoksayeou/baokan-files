Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Panchen Erdeni's speech at the first session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC. The full text is as follows:

Fellow members:

Recently, my speech at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, based on the wishes of all Tibetan monks and laypeople and based on full facts, has provoked hostility and curses from some Indian newspapers. To my surprise, even Prime Minister Nehru said my speech was "unfair." I would like to take this opportunity at the CPPCC meeting to say a few words about this. (Applause)

Prime Minister Nehru did not give any explanation when he accused me. I still don't understand what is "unfair" about my speech. Is it unfair to India that I solemnly declared the ironclad fact that Tibet is an inseparable part of China? (Warm applause) Is it "unfair" that I talked about not allowing any foreigners to interfere in our Tibet and our motherland - the People's Republic of China? (Warm applause) Is it "unfair" that I expressed anger at the absurd remarks of certain expansionist elements in India who are vigorously undermining our national unity and Sino-Indian friendship? (Warm applause) I don't think these can be reasons for accusing me of being "unfair." (Applause) I ask, if the internal affairs of a certain state in India are subjected to gross interference by another country, would Indian patriots approve, welcome, or remain silent? (Applause) When my country's internal affairs are subjected to arrogant foreign interference, I stand on the position of safeguarding national unity, safeguarding national solidarity, and safeguarding Sino-Indian friendship, and express a righteous and stern warning, which is not only completely fair but also completely appropriate. (Prolonged and warm applause)

Prime Minister Nehru also stated in his speech that he would welcome me to India to meet with the Dalai Lama, or to meet with anyone I wished to meet, and that India would receive me with all courtesy. The invitation is undoubtedly to be thanked, but it is said that the intention of this invitation is for me to verify that the Dalai Lama was not abducted to India. I think that since Prime Minister Nehru also said that the Dalai Lama has admitted that the three letters he gave to General Tan Guansan are genuine, then this alone is already a powerful illustration of the fact that the Dalai Lama was abducted. (Warm applause) Under such circumstances, I don't see any point in my going to India. If Prime Minister Nehru's intention is to hope that I go to India to talk about the so-called Tibet issue, then I should solemnly declare that the Tibet issue can only be resolved in Tibet, in China, and absolutely not in any foreign country. (Long and continuous applause) This principle is very obvious, and I believe that no one will fail to understand this, nor should there be any misunderstanding. (Applause)

Before the Dalai Lama returned to China, I was acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Although I am very concerned about the Dalai Lama, I am unable to travel far due to the heavy responsibilities I bear. I can remotely comfort the Dalai Lama with the following: first, the National People's Congress has elected both the Dalai Lama and me as Vice-Chairmen of the NPC; second, the rebellion of the reactionary elements in Tibet has now been basically quelled, the bloody fighting has basically stopped, order is rapidly being restored, the army and the people are as close as one family, the people are living and working in peace and contentment, and national regional autonomy is being actively promoted in preparation for democratic reform. (Applause) Both I and the Tibetan people hope that the Dalai Lama will return to the motherland as soon as possible and see the smooth realization of his wishes regarding the reform of Tibet. (Warm applause)

India is our great neighbor. I have full respect for India and the Indian people. The Dalai Lama and I were invited to India by the Vice President of India in 1956. The Indian people expressed a warm welcome to both the Dalai Lama and me, for which I am deeply grateful. The profound friendship between the peoples of China and India has thus been further demonstrated. However, I also happen to recall a small matter: during that visit, some Indian officials often showed discrimination against me in arranging the reception. My entourage sometimes did not even have a house to live in and had to live in train carriages. This was of course not known to the Indian people, and I think it may not have been a planned arrangement by the Indian government. However, this cannot but leave me with an impression. (The whole audience is lively and applauds)

Mr. Nehru said: "India's interest in Tibet is historical, emotional, and religious, but not basically political." I feel that this statement cannot explain the words and deeds of certain Indian political figures who have recently interfered in our internal affairs. (Applause) The people of the world are very clear that Kalimpong in India has for several years become a center for imperialists, the Kuomintang bandit gang, and Tibetan rebel elements to carry out conspiracies against the People's Republic of China. Recently, some arrogant people in India have used the Tibetan rebellion and the so-called Dalai Lama's statement to attack and slander our great motherland, undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, interfere in our internal affairs, advocate so-called "Tibetan independence," and incite anti-China sentiments. How can it be said that these people's words and deeds do not belong to the political sphere? (Warm applause)

As for the religious interest, I cannot help but recall some personal experiences. Buddhism once prevailed in India, and India has many Buddhist holy sites. However, when we visited India in 1956, we saw with our own eyes that many famous religious monasteries in India, such as Nalanda, Vajrasana (the temple where Sakyamuni first preached), Rajgir, and Bodh Gaya, were dilapidated, with sparse incense and almost no good deeds; the Buddha statues were tilted, with broken noses and rotten eyes, missing arms and legs. (Laughter) We knew that there are very few people in India who believe in Buddhism now. But it is very strange that some people who are so unconcerned about Buddhism in their own country are constantly talking about caring about Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan cultural relics. (Laughter) (Laughter, prolonged applause) We piously believe in religion, but we firmly oppose anyone using the guise of religion to carry out activities that interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Whether Tibetan or Indian, people should be vigilant against such people and not be fooled! (Long and enthusiastic applause)

Now that the rebellion of the reactionary elements in Tibet has been basically quelled, the so-called Tibet issue has also basically come to an end. (Applause) However, a few foreign interferers are still trying to use the so-called Tibet issue to stir up trouble in the world. I believe that all Indian friends who do not sympathize with those heinous rebels who abducted the Dalai Lama, but truly sympathize with the Dalai Lama and the broad masses of Tibetan monks and laypeople, safeguard the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and safeguard Sino-Indian friendship, will certainly severely condemn and stop the arrogant clamor of these interferers. (Warm applause) The 600 million people of all nationalities in our country and the 400 million people of India will never allow anyone to undermine the great friendship between the peoples of China and India under any name! (Long and stormy applause)

### 西藏问题只能在西藏解决，在中国解决，决不能在任何外国去解决  班禅额尔德尼在政协三届首次会议上的发言

    西藏问题只能在西藏解决，在中国解决，决不能在任何外国去解决
    班禅额尔德尼在政协三届首次会议上的发言
    新华社29日讯　班禅额尔德尼在政协全国委员会第三届第一次会议上的发言。全文如下：各位委员：
    最近，我在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，依照西藏全体僧俗人民的意愿，并以充分事实为根据的发言，竟引起了印度一些报刊的仇视和咒骂。出于我的意外的是，连尼赫鲁总理也说我的发言“不公正”。关于这个问题，我想借政协会议的机会谈几句。（鼓掌）
    尼赫鲁总理在指责我的时候并没有作什么解释。我到现在还不明白，我的发言究竟有什么“不公正”的地方。难道我郑重地声明西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分这个铁一般的事实，对于印度就不公正了吗？（热烈鼓掌）难道我谈了我们不许任何外国人干涉我们西藏和我们祖国——中华人民共和国——的事情就是“不公正”的吗？（热烈鼓掌）难道我对于印度某些扩张主义分子大肆破坏我国统一、破坏中印友谊的荒谬言论表示愤怒，就是“不公正”的吗？（热烈鼓掌）我想这些都不能成为责备我“不公正”的理由。（鼓掌）试问，如果印度某一个邦的内政遭受别国粗暴干涉的时候，印度的爱国人士能够表示赞成，表示欢迎或者闭口不言吗？（鼓掌）当我国内政受到外国狂妄干涉的时候，我站在维护祖国统一、维护民族团结、维护中印友谊的立场，表示义正词严的警告，这不但完全是公正的，而且完全是应该的。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    尼赫鲁总理在谈话中还表示，他欢迎我到印度去会见达赖喇嘛，或者会见我愿意会见的任何人，并且说，印度会以每一种礼仪来接待我。邀请无疑是应当感谢的，但是据说，这个邀请的用意是要我去证实一下达赖喇嘛并不是被劫走到印度去的。我想，既然尼赫鲁总理也说，达赖喇嘛已经承认他给谭冠三将军的三封信是真的，那么，只是这一点，就已经有力地说明了达赖喇嘛被劫走的事实。（热烈鼓掌）在这样的情况下，我看不出我去印度还有什么意义。如果尼赫鲁总理的意思是希望我到印度去谈所谓西藏问题，那么我应当郑重声明，西藏问题只能在西藏解决，在中国解决，决不能在任何外国去解决。（经久不息的掌声）这个道理非常明显，我相信，无论什么人在这一点上不会不了解，也不应当有任何的不了解。（鼓掌）
    在达赖喇嘛回国以前，我代理着西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员，虽然我很关切达赖喇嘛，但是，由于身负重任，势难远行。我可以遥向达赖喇嘛告慰的，一是全国人民代表大会已经选出达赖喇嘛和我为人大副委员长；二是西藏反动分子的叛乱现已基本平息，流血的战事已经基本停止，秩序迅速恢复，军民亲如一家，人民安居乐业，并且正在积极推行民族区域自治，准备民主改革。（鼓掌）我和西藏人民都希望达赖喇嘛早日回到祖国，看到他平日关于西藏改革的愿望顺利实现。（热烈鼓掌）
    印度是我们伟大的邻邦。对于印度和印度人民，我怀有充分的敬意。我和达赖喇嘛曾经在一九五六年应印度副总统的邀请到印度。印度人民对达赖喇嘛和我都表示了热烈的欢迎，这是我深切感谢的。中印两国人民的深厚友谊，由此又得到一番证明。不过我也顺便想起一件小事：在那次访问期间，某些印度官员在安排接待的时候，常常表现出一种对我的歧视，我的随行人员有时甚至没有房子住，而只好住在火车车厢里。这当然不是印度人民所知道的，而且我想，这也许不是印度政府有计划的安排。不过这不能不给我留下一个印象罢了。（全场活跃、鼓掌）
    尼赫鲁先生说：“印度对西藏的兴趣是历史的、情感的和宗教的，而基本上不是在政治方面。”我觉得，这种说法并不能解释最近以来印度某些政界人士干涉我国内政的言行。（鼓掌）全世界人民都很清楚：印度噶伦堡几年来就成了帝国主义者、国民党匪帮和西藏叛乱分子进行反对中华人民共和国的阴谋活动的一个中心。最近，印度有一些狂妄的人，利用西藏叛乱和所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，对我们伟大祖国进行攻击毁谤，破坏五项原则，干涉我国内政，鼓吹所谓“西藏独立”，煽动反华情绪。象这些人的这些言行，怎么能说并不属于政治方面呢？（热烈鼓掌）
    至于说到宗教方面的兴趣，我不禁又想起一些亲身经历。佛教曾经在印度流行过，印度有许多佛教圣地。但是我们一九五六年在印度参观时亲眼看到，印度有名的纳连哲、瓦日拉色（释迦牟尼首次讲经的寺院）、陆乔、巴基惹等不少宗教寺院，破烂不堪，香烟不茂，善事几乎绝缘；佛像东倒西歪，破鼻烂眼，缺臂少脚。（笑声）印度现在信佛教的人很少，这原是我们知道的。但是有一些对自己国家的佛教如此不关心的人，偏偏口口声声关心西藏佛教和西藏文物，（笑声）这不是很奇怪吗？（笑声，长时间的掌声）我们虔诚地信仰宗教，但是坚决反对任何人借着宗教的幌子进行干涉别国内政的活动。无论西藏人或者印度人，都应该对于这种人提高警惕，不要上当！（经久不息的热烈的掌声）
    现在西藏反动分子的叛乱既然基本平息，所谓西藏问题也就基本结束。（鼓掌）但是少数外国干涉者还在企图利用所谓西藏问题在世界上兴风作浪。我相信，一切不是同情那些劫持达赖喇嘛的万恶叛匪、而真正同情达赖喇嘛和同情西藏广大僧俗人民、维护五项原则、维护中印友好的印度朋友们，一定能对这种干涉者的狂妄叫嚣给以严厉谴责和制止。（热烈鼓掌）我国各民族六亿多人民和印度四亿人民，决不允许任何人以任何名义来破坏中印两国人民之间的伟大友谊！（经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声）
