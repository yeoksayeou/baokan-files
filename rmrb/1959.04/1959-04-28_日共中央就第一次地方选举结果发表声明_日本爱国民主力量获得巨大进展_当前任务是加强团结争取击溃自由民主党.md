Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th. The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party today published a statement in the "Akahata" entitled "Regarding the Results of the First Local Elections."

The statement pointed out that although the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party used despicable means such as buying votes and fascist suppression in this local election, the election results were contrary to their wishes. The Liberal Democratic Party lost 155 seats in the prefectural assembly elections; democratic forces made considerable progress. The Socialist Party increased by 103 seats; the Communist Party increased by 3 seats. Consequently, the proportion of seats held by democratic forces in the national local prefectural assemblies has increased from one-fifth to one-quarter, and has reached one-third in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagano prefectures, and has overwhelmed the Liberal Democratic Party in Fukuoka Prefecture. The statement pointed out that this phenomenon clearly proves that the seemingly powerful Liberal Democratic Party has begun to collapse from its foundations. This trend of collapse is not accidental. It proves that the Japanese people's dissatisfaction and opposition to the Liberal Democratic Party's anti-national and anti-people policy of subordination to the United States is growing stronger.

The statement said that the Japanese Communist Party, under the illegal suppression of the Kishi Nobusuke government, held high the banner of patriotism and launched a struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party. This encouraged the people and finally enabled the Japanese Communist Party to win 500,000 votes in the gubernatorial election, and twelve candidates were elected as prefectural assembly members.

The statement pointed out that these 500,000 votes are a manifestation of support for the Japanese Communist Party's struggle to defend the interests of the people and the glory of the nation.

The statement said that the Japanese Communist Party is currently responsible for defeating anti-national and anti-people forces such as the Liberal Democratic Party, and at the same time bears the important task of unifying patriotic and democratic forces. Currently, this task is more important than ever before.

The statement pointed out that only the struggle of the Japanese Communist Party can give the people encouragement and confidence, and pointed out the road to victory.

In the statement, the Japanese Communist Party resolutely stated that in order to respond to the people's support and expectations, it will struggle to achieve the above-mentioned tasks in the continuing local elections and House of Councillors elections.

    日共中央就第一次地方选举结果发表声明
    日本爱国民主力量获得巨大进展
    当前任务是加强团结争取击溃自由民主党
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天在“赤旗报”上发表“关于第一次地方选举结果”的声明。
    声明指出，岸信介内阁和自由民主党虽然在这次地方选举中施用了收买选票和法西斯镇压等卑鄙手段，但是选举结果却同它们的愿望相反。自由民主党在县议员选举中丧失了一百五十五个议席；民主力量获得了相当大的进展。社会党增加了一百零三个议席；共产党增加了三个议席。因而，民主力量在全国地方县议会中所占的议席比数已经从五分之一增加到四分之一，并且在东京都、大阪府、长野县占了三分之一，在福冈县压倒了自由民主党。声明指出，这种现象清楚地证明，貌似强大的自由民主党已经开始从它的根基上崩溃。这种崩溃的趋势并不是偶然的，这证明：日本人民不满和反对自由民主党从属于美国的反民族、反人民政策的情绪和斗争，正在日益增强。
    声明说，日本共产党在岸信介政府非法镇压的情况下，高举着爱国的旗帜，同岸信介内阁和自由民主党展开了斗争。这鼓励了人民，终于使日本共产党在知事选举中获得了五十万张选票，并且十二名候选人当选为县议会议员。
    声明指出，这五十万张选票是支持为保卫人民利益和民族光荣而斗争的日本共产党的表现。
    声明说，日本共产党目前负有击溃自由民主党等反民族、反人民势力的任务，同时负有使爱国民主力量统一的重大任务。目前，这个任务比过去任何时候都更加重要。
    声明指出，只有日本共产党的奋斗才能给人民以鼓舞和信心，并指出争取胜利的道路。
    日本共产党在声明中坚决表示为了回答人民对它的支持和期望，它将在继续举行的地方选举和参议员选举中为实现上述任务而奋斗。
