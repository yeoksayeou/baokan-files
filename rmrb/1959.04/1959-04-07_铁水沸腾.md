    Molten Iron Boils
    By our reporters Gu Feng and Sun Ming
    Going northwest from Benxi city, crossing the famous Taizi River Bridge, and looking along the winding embankment road at the foot of the mountain, the coking ovens, hot blast stoves, and iron-smelting blast furnaces are spewing clouds of thick smoke; trains roaring by, fully loaded with fine ore powder, have just entered the factory, and trains carrying iron blocks are speeding out of the factory. All this shows us that the Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant is right in front of us.
    This is not our first visit to this factory, which is holding high the red flag of iron smelting. We remember that in April last year, encouraged by the rectification movement, the iron-smelting workers broke through the shackles of conservative thinking and boldly adopted advanced operating methods to increase smelting intensity in the blast furnace, creating an excellent utilization coefficient of 1.5, thereby winning the glorious title of national blast furnace collective champion. When we revisited this factory in September last year, we found that the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace had broken through the 2 mark. At the end of March this year, when we came to this factory for the third time, the blast furnace workers created the miracle of a utilization coefficient of 2.247, pushing iron-smelting technology to a new level.
    People can't help but feel excited when they hear about this new achievement in iron-smelting technology! However, only when you see with your own eyes that these miracles come from an old factory with outdated equipment can you understand how precious the creative spirit of the iron-smelting workers is!
  Originally, the factory's blast furnaces, hot blast stoves, coking ovens, sintering machines, and casting machines were all old equipment from more than forty years ago. As early as a dozen years ago, this kind of backward hot blast stove had been eliminated by modern iron and steel plants. However, all the workers in the factory rely on their own hardworking hands and wisdom to plant a high-yield red flag in such a factory. How can you say it's not a miracle!
      New Milestone
    At the end of March this year, when we visited this factory for the third time, the workers had just celebrated the glorious anniversary of holding high the red flag for one year with the achievement of completing the first quarter's production plan seven days ahead of schedule. In recent days, they have erected a larger leap forward milestone on the road to progress. The two red flags planted at the top of the blast furnace last year are still fluttering in the wind amidst the smoke in the sky; now, on the lower horizontal beam in front of the furnace, there is another large slogan that reads, "Realize coefficient of 2.35 early, and the high-yield red flag will always lead." The more than 60,000 suggestions for technological innovation posted by workers on the competition platforms and treasure-offering platforms in front of each workshop are forming a powerful driving force, pushing the production of blast furnaces to a new climax.
    Daring to think, daring to act, daring to be boldly creative, and being brave in constantly pursuing new goals have become a common practice among the workers of this factory. As early as last year, based on years of experience, the blast furnace workers changed the diameter of the blast furnace tuyeres from the original 120 mm to 140 mm, effectively increasing the smelting intensity in the furnace. However, the workers were not satisfied with these improvements. Not long ago, after further experimentation, they gradually expanded the existing many narrow and thin tuyeres of the blast furnace from a diameter of 140 mm to 160-180 mm; at the same time, they changed the shape of the tuyeres from cylindrical to flared. In this way, the hot air sent from the hot blast stove can quickly and evenly reach the center of the furnace, increase the range of coke combustion, and increase the smelting intensity in the furnace by 12% compared with the past, and the output of pig iron has also increased accordingly by about 12%.
    Similar moving examples of boldly innovating technology can be seen and heard everywhere in this factory.
      One Year of Hard Work
    A high-yield red flag embodies the hard work, bravery, and wisdom of many workers. On the platform of the blast furnace, we saw repair workers who guard the blast furnace day and night, replacing tuyeres under high temperature or climbing to the top of the blast furnace to repair the furnace wall. The workshop cadres told us that, because the equipment of the blast furnace is outdated, ensuring that it has few problems, or quickly repairing it after problems occur, is an important part of the continuous increase in production of the blast furnace. At the end of February this year, gas leaked from the throat of the blast furnace. If the brickwork was not reinforced in time, many holes would be burned in the furnace shell. At this time, the repair workers climbed to the upper part of the blast furnace and took turns repairing it for three days, finally repairing the refractory bricks on the furnace throat and wrapping the iron skin. This arduous repair task only took one-seventh of the originally planned repair time.
    Next to the blast furnace, we met the old repair worker Liu Juguo. He is familiar with the condition of various pipelines on the blast furnace and is one of the most experienced old repair workers in the factory. Although Liu Juguo is nearly sixty years old this year, he still climbs up and down the furnace platform, which is more than ten stories high, every day like a young man, leading the young repair workers to replace the muscles and bones of the blast furnace. During the year when the factory raised the red flag high, the repair team he led closely cooperated with the blast furnace workers, improved the repair methods, and shortened the time for replacing the tuyere water pipes from more than ten minutes a year ago to five minutes, and the fastest time was three minutes for one.
    No. 1 blast furnace is about to tap iron. Sun Fucai, a furnace-front technician in his fifties who has made a great contribution to the high output of the blast furnace in the past year, led several workers holding steel drills and quickly opened the taphole. At this time, the molten iron poured along the trough into the large tank at the bottom of the blast furnace. Seeing Sun Fucai's skilled operation, we were reminded of his heroic rescue of the taphole not long ago. That day, after the furnace-front workers took over the shift, they suddenly discovered that the cooling water immersed in the furnace wall was overflowing from the taphole. At this time, seventy to eighty tons of molten iron in the hearth were tumbling and rolling. If the taphole was corroded by cold water, an accident might occur in the blast furnace. Sun Fucai, who had just gotten off work, rushed back to the blast furnace immediately after hearing the news, carefully inspected the place where the water was leaking, and after a tense battle, he and his assistants finally blocked the overflowing water, and the molten iron flowed out of the taphole smoothly.
      Collective Honor
    In a short few days of visiting, the spirit of communist cooperation of those who are far away from the blast furnace but work day and night for the blast furnace left a deep impression on us. On the wide platform at the top of the coking oven, we saw several workers operating a giant coal loader, adding coal powder non-stop to the coking oven that was emitting yellow smoke; several fire-adjusting workers holding iron hooks opened the fire eyes and carefully observed the temperature inside the oven. The old fire-adjusting worker, the famous red flag bearer Zhang Rongge, pointed to the row of coking oven fire mouths and said proudly: The quality of the coking oven temperature adjustment is related to the output and quality of the coke. In the past year, this old worker has continuously improved the technical operation and mechanical equipment, effectively improving the output and quality of coke.
    The coking oven is about to produce coke. The high steel plate furnace door has just been lifted, and piles of red-hot coke are pushed out of the furnace door by the coke pusher. At this time, the coke-raking workers held iron hooks and constantly pushed the coke blocking the furnace door into the train. In the first quarter of this year, the output of coke exceeded the plan month by month. The 7,000 tons of coke increased in three months can supply the blast furnace to smelt more than 10,000 tons of pig iron.
    The sintering workers who produce artificial rich ore for the blast furnace are no less energetic than the coking workers. The dazzling treasure-offering platform opposite the workshop concentrates the diligence and wisdom of the workers. Next to the side-by-side sintering machines, we saw workers busily filling the sintering machines with mineral powder. In less than twenty minutes, pieces of sintered rich ore with through holes rolled from the sintering machine to the platform below. At this time, the material-raking workers operated the vibrating screen to remove the powder debris from the ore blocks, and pushed the ore cars full of sintered ore to the blast furnace's hopper.
    When we left this factory, thousands of workers fighting on various different posts were carrying out a high-yield, high-quality competition centered on improving the utilization coefficient, determined to create newer production achievements, and plant the high-yield red flag they had already won on a higher peak; they were determined to send their representatives to Beijing in the fourth quarter to participate in the National Congress of Heroes.

    铁水沸腾
    本报记者　谷峰　孙铭
    出本溪城往西北行，跨过著名的太子河大桥，顺着弯弯曲曲的堤岸公路望去，屹立在山脚下的炼焦炉、热风炉和炼铁高炉，正在喷吐着云雾般的浓烟；一辆辆吼叫着的火车，满载精矿粉刚刚开进工厂，装运铁块的列车，又飞快地从厂内驶出来。这一切景象告诉我们：本溪第一钢铁厂就在眼前了。
    访问这个高举炼铁红旗的工厂，对我们来说已经不是第一次了。记得去年4月间，炼铁职工在整风运动的鼓舞下，冲破保守思想的束缚，在高炉上大胆采用提高冶炼强度的先进操作方法，创造出有效容积利用系数一点五的优异成绩，并由此获得了全国高炉集体冠军的光荣称号。去年9月，当我们重访这个工厂时，发现高炉的利用系数又突破二的大关。今年3月末，我们第三次来到这个厂时，高炉工人又创造了利用系数二点二四七的奇迹，把炼铁技术推上新的阶梯。
    听到这个炼铁技术上的新成就，人们无不感到振奋！然而，只有当你亲眼看到这些奇迹，是出自一个设备陈旧的老厂，才理解到炼铁职工们的创造精神是多么可贵！
  原来，这个工厂的高炉、热风炉、炼焦炉、烧结机和铸铁机，都是四十多年以前的老设备。早在十几年前，这种落后的热风炉，就被现代化的炼铁厂淘汰了。可是，全厂职工靠着自己勤劳的双手和智慧，在这样一个工厂里插上高产红旗，怎能说不是一个奇迹呢！
      新的里程碑
    今年的3月末，我们第三次访问这个工厂时，工人们刚刚以提前七天完成首季生产计划的成就，庆贺了高举红旗一周年的光荣节日。这些天来，他们又在前进的道路上，树起了一个更大跃进的里程碑。去年插上高炉顶端的两面红旗，还在高空的烟雾中迎风招展；现在，炉前下层的横梁上，又贴出了一幅“系数二点三五早实现，高产红旗永领先”的大字标语。各个车间前边的比武台、献宝台上，工人们贴出的六万多条革新技术的建议，正在形成一股强大的动力，把高炉的生产推向新的高潮。
    敢想、敢干、敢于大胆创造，勇于不断追求新的目标，在这个工厂的职工中已经形成普遍的风尚。早在去年，高炉工人根据多年的经验，把高炉风口的直径从原来的一百二十公厘改为一百四十公厘，有效地提高了炉内的冶炼强度。但是，职工们却不满足于这些改进，不久前，他们又经过试验，把高炉现有的许多窄细的风口，由直径一百四十公厘逐步扩大到一百六十至一百八十公厘；同时，把风口的形状由圆筒形的改成喇叭形的。这样，从热风炉送来的热风，很快就能均匀地送到炉的中心，加大焦炭燃烧的范围，使炉内的冶炼强度比过去提高12％，生铁的产量也相应地提高了12％左右。
    类似这样大胆革新技术的动人事例，在这个工厂里到处都可以看到、听到。
      奋战一年间
    一面高产红旗，包含着多少工人的勤劳、勇敢和智慧。在高炉的平台上，我们看到日夜守候在高炉上的检修工人，正在高温下换装风口，或是爬到高炉的顶端修补炉墙。车间干部告诉我们：由于高炉的设备陈旧，保证它少出毛病，或者出了毛病后很快就治好它，是高炉不断增产的重要环节。今年2月底，高炉的炉喉冒出瓦斯，如果不及时砌砖加固，炉皮就会烧出很多窟窿。这时，检修工人爬上高炉上部，轮班检修了三天，终于把炉喉上的耐火砖砌好，包扎好铁皮。这样一项繁重的检修任务，只用了原计划检修时间的七分之一。
    在高炉旁，我们遇到了老检修工人刘巨国。他熟悉高炉上各种管道的情况，是厂里最有经验的老检修工人之一。刘巨国今年虽然年近六旬，但他仍像年轻小伙子一样，每天在十几层楼高的炉台上爬上爬下，领着年轻的检修工人为高炉换筋接骨。在工厂高插红旗的一年间，他领导的检修小组，同高炉工人们密切配合，改进了检修方法，把换风口水管的时间，由一年前的十多分钟，缩短到五分钟，最快时三分钟就换一个。
    一号高炉要出铁了。一年来对高炉多产作出很大贡献的五十多岁的炉前技师孙福财，带领着几个手持钢钎的工人，很快地打开了出铁口。这时，铁水顺着铁水沟向高炉底下的大罐里倾泻。看到孙福财的熟练操作，我们又想起了不久前他英勇地抢救出铁口的故事。那天，炉前工人在接班后，突然发现浸进炉墙的冷却水从出铁口溢出。这时候，炉缸里的七、八十吨铁水正在翻腾滚动，要是出铁口被冷水浸蚀坏了，高炉可能发生事故。刚刚下班的孙福财，听到这个消息，立刻奔回高炉，仔细地检查了冒水的地方，经过一场紧张的战斗，他和助手们终于把溢水堵住了，出铁口顺利地流出铁水。
      集体的荣誉
    在短短的几天访问中，那些远离高炉而又为高炉日夜操劳的人们的共产主义协作精神，给我们留下了深刻的印象。在炼焦炉顶端宽阔的平台上，我们看到几个工人操纵着巨型加煤机，一刻不停地往冒着黄烟的焦炉内加添煤粉；几个手握铁勾的调火工人，扒开火眼，仔细地观察炉内的温度。老调火工人、著名的红旗手张荣格，指着排列成行的焦炉火口自豪地说：焦炉温度调整的好坏，关系到焦炭的产量和质量。最近一年来，这位老工人不断地改进了技术操作和机械设备，有效地提高了焦炭的产量和质量。
    焦炉快出焦了。高高的钢板炉门刚刚吊起，一堆堆通红的焦炭就被推焦机顶出炉门。这时候，扒焦工人握着铁勾，不时把堵在炉门的焦炭推进火车。今年第一季度，焦炭的产量月月超过计划。三个月增产的七千吨焦炭，可以供给高炉多炼出一万多吨生铁。
    在为高炉生产人造富矿的烧结工人，干劲丝毫不亚于炼焦工人。车间对面琳琅满目的献宝台上，集中地表现着工人们的勤劳和智慧。在并排的烧结机旁，我们看到工人们正紧张地给烧结机充添矿粉。不到二十分钟，一块块烧得透孔的烧结富矿，就从烧结机上滚到台下。这时，扒料工人一面操纵震动筛，除去矿块中的粉屑，一面把装满烧结矿的矿车，推送到高炉的料仓。
    当我们离开这个工厂的时候，战斗在各个不同岗位上的数千名职工，正在开展以提高利用系数为中心的高产、优质竞赛，决心创造更新的生产成就，把已经夺得的高产红旗插上更高峰；他们决心到第四季度，派出自己的代表，去北京参加群英大会。
