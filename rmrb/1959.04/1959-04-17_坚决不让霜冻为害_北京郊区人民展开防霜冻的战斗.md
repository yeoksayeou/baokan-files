　　Resolutely Prevent Frost Damage
　　People in the Suburbs of Beijing Launch a Battle Against Frost

　　(Our dispatch) After hearing the frost warning on the morning of the 16th, the people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing immediately formed frost prevention teams and launched a battle.

　　The members of the Huangtugang Commune formed an army of more than 11,000 people to cover the newly emerged potato seedlings with soil. The more than 300 members of the Xinfadi Production Team of this commune, after covering all 320 mu of potato fields in the team with soil, mobilized six carts to bring all the mats from their homes to the fields to cover the new seedlings of vegetables such as cucumbers, eggplants, and tomatoes. The seedlings of Chinese cabbage and cauliflower in the Sixth Circle First Production Team, which were being prepared for seed production, were in full bloom and could not be covered or smoked. The members used straw to make torches, preparing to light the torches and walk through the fields when frost appeared.

　　From yesterday afternoon, the members of the Lugu Production Team of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Commune in Shijingshan People's Commune began to cover the sunbeds with frost-proof covers, while also carrying large amounts of firewood to the radish fields, preparing to smoke them at the appropriate time in the evening. The production team leader decided to personally be on duty in the fields all night.

　　The Nanyuan People's Commune and the Haidian People's Commune have both organized a large number of cadres to specifically assist various production teams in preventing frost.

　　坚决不让霜冻为害
　　北京郊区人民展开防霜冻的战斗
    本报讯　北京郊区各人民公社在16日上午听到霜冻警报后，立即组成防霜冻队伍展开战斗。
    黄土岗公社的社员们，组成了一支一万一千多人的大军，给刚出土的土豆幼苗封土。这个公社新发地生产队的三百多名社员，在把队里三百二十亩土豆地全部封了土之后，又动员了六辆大车，把家里所有的席子都拉到地里盖住黄瓜、茄子和西红柿等蔬菜的新苗。六圈第一生产队准备打籽用的大白菜和菜花的苗子正在开花时期，不能盖也不能熏，社员们就用草捆成火把，准备在霜冻出现时，点火把在地里串走。
    石景山人民公社中苏友好社鲁谷生产队的队员们从昨天下午开始，一面在阳畦上盖好了防冻的盖子，一面把大批柴禾抱到小萝卜地里，准备晚上适当时机熏烟。这个队的生产队长决定亲自在田里通夜值班。
    南苑人民公社、海淀人民公社都组织了大批干部，到各生产队具体协助防止霜冻。
