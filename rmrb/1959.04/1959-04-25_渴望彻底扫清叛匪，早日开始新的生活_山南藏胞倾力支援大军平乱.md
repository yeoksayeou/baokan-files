Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 24th: A reporter from this agency accompanying the army reports on the scene of the vast number of Tibetan compatriots in the Shannan region actively supporting the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebellion: Along the way as the People's Liberation Army's suppression army advances toward the bandit lair in Shannan, groups of Tibetan compatriots are encountered everywhere. They stand by the roadside or on high ground, constantly applauding and cheering our army, waving their hands in greeting. The masses who were forced to flee by the bandits, after hearing the good news of the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, rushed back home from places several or dozens of miles away, driving their cattle and sheep. The Tibetan compatriots all joyfully told each other: "The Bodhisattva soldiers" have arrived! "Chairman Mao's army" has arrived!

Once our army entered the Shannan area, one could see everywhere the desolate scene of the bandits' atrocities against the people. On dozens of miles of looted land, you could not see a single person plowing the fields in spring, nor a single irrigation ditch releasing water into the fields. Many young adults had been taken away by the bandits, and many cattle had been slaughtered. In the Zetang and Pozhang Xika areas, the bandits caused many families to be broken and destroyed. In Cangzhu Village, the bandits raped all the women, and even girls in their teens and old women in their fifties were not spared. In Nedongzong, the bandits even dug out the heart of a Tibetan tailor named Pünchog. The Tibetan compatriots who had been harmed by the bandits saw the People's Liberation Army as if they were seeing their own relatives. As soon as they met, they wept bitterly and accused our army of the heinous crimes of the bandits. As soon as our army arrived in Alagang, more than twenty Tibetan compatriots gathered around to accuse the soldiers of the bandits' crimes. They said: "The bandits robbed our cattle and sheep. We hope the People's Liberation Army will completely eliminate the bandits and help us find our cattle and sheep." Some Tibetan compatriots enthusiastically brought horse grass and actively fed the horses for the troops. They said, "Let the horses eat their fill, so they can quickly pursue and annihilate the bandits." Some Tibetan compatriots took out their own firewood to cook for the troops, and some brought pickles to comfort the troops. When the soldiers refused to eat them, the Tibetan compatriots repeatedly urged them, saying: "The bandits have robbed all the cattle and sheep from my family. You are now fighting the bandits for us. Giving you some pickles is a small token of our respect!"

During our army's advance in the Shannan area, it received enthusiastic support from the vast number of Tibetan people. In order to eliminate the bandits as soon as possible, the Tibetan compatriots voluntarily organized a large number of manpower and animal power to help the suppression army build bridges, repair roads, and transport military grain and ammunition. The Zetang Tibetan compatriots voluntarily formed a transport team of more than two hundred donkeys to transport supplies for the army pursuing and annihilating the bandits. More than 1,500 Tibetan compatriots in Zhegu, Lajiali and other places actively participated in building roads for the suppression army. In many places, Tibetan compatriots voluntarily reported information about the bandits to our army and asked to lead the way for the People's Liberation Army to help them pursue and annihilate the bandits.

The Tibetan compatriots hate the bandits to the bone. When the People's Liberation Army beat the bandits into a desperate flight, the Tibetan compatriots all rose up to capture the scattered bandits. In Qunmagou, a Tibetan compatriot killed one fleeing bandit and wounded another, seizing two rifles, one pistol, and more than two hundred rounds of ammunition. When our army arrived, he came to present these weapons to the People's Liberation Army, asking the People's Liberation Army to use these weapons to fiercely annihilate the bandits for him.

    渴望彻底扫清叛匪，早日开始新的生活
    山南藏胞倾力支援大军平乱
    新华社拉萨24日电　本社随军记者报道：山南地区广大藏胞积极支援人民解放军平叛大军讨伐叛匪的情景说：人民解放军平叛大军在向山南匪巢进军的沿路上，到处都遇到成群的藏族同胞，他们站在路旁或高岗上，不断地向我军鼓掌欢呼、挥手问好。为叛匪所逼害而外逃的群众，听到人民解放军来到的喜讯以后，都纷纷赶着自己的牛羊，从数里或数十里外的地方赶回家来。藏胞们都欢欣鼓舞地相互传告：“菩萨兵”来了！“毛主席的军队”来了！
    我军一进入山南地区，到处都可以看到叛匪残害人民的满目凄凉的景象。你可以在几十里被劫的土地上，看不到一个在田地里春耕的人，看不到一条水渠在放水灌田。很多青壮年被叛匪拉走了，很多耕牛被叛匪杀掉了。在泽当和颇章西卡一带，叛匪把许多人家搞得家破人亡。叛匪在仓珠村奸污了所有的妇女，就连十多岁的小女孩和五十岁的老太婆也未能幸免。叛匪在乃东宗竟把一个藏族裁缝平措的心挖了出来。遭到叛匪残害的藏族同胞，见到人民解放军就像见到自己的亲人一样，一见面，就痛哭流涕地向我军控诉叛匪滔天的罪行。我军一到阿拉岗，就有二十多个藏族同胞，围拢来向战士们控诉叛匪的罪行，他们说：“叛匪抢走了我家的牛羊，希望解放军彻底消灭叛匪，帮助找回牛羊。”有的藏胞热情地抱来马草，积极地给部队喂马，他们说：“让马吃饱，好快去追歼叛匪。”有的藏胞拿出自己的柴火给部队烧饭，有的端来咸菜慰问部队，战士们不吃，藏胞们再三劝战士说：“土匪把我家牛羊都抢跑了，你们现在为我们打土匪，送给你们一点咸菜也算表示了我们的敬意！”
    我军在山南地区的进军中，得到了广大藏族人民的热烈支援，藏胞们为着早日扫灭叛匪，自动组织大批人力、畜力，帮助平叛大军架桥、修路、运送军粮和弹药。泽当藏胞自动组成有二百多头驴的运输队，为追歼叛匪的大军运送物资。哲古、拉加里等地有一千五百多藏胞，积极参加为平叛大军修筑公路。很多地方的藏胞主动向我军报告匪情，并且要求为解放军带路，帮助解放军追歼叛匪。
    藏族同胞对叛匪恨之入骨，当解放军把叛匪打得狼狈逃窜的时候，藏胞们都纷纷起来捉拿散匪。在群马沟有一个藏胞，他打死打伤逃匪各一名，缴步枪二支、短枪一支、子弹二百多发，当我军到达时，他又前来把这些武器送给解放军，要解放军用这些武器给他狠狠地痛歼叛匪。
