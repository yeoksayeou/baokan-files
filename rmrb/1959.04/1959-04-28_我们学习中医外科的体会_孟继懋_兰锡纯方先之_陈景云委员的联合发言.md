    We were very excited to hear Premier Zhou's Government Work Report. We believe this is a resounding call to action for the people of the whole country to leap forward again and again. Our people, our friends, and peace-loving people all over the world will rejoice at hearing this call, while those imperialists and reactionaries will undoubtedly be even more frightened. After hearing this report, we further realized that medical work must adapt to the needs of the entire socialist construction, which is the glorious task of all our medical and health workers.
    The four of us are all surgeons, so we exchanged views on how the surgical specialty can adapt to the needs of socialist construction. In the conversation, we naturally talked about the issue of Western medicine doctors learning from traditional Chinese medicine. Finally, we came to some common understandings, which may have errors, and we hope everyone will criticize and give guidance.
    The Party Central Committee formulated our Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine many years ago. In the years since liberation, we have not studied well, and our understanding of the spirit of carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine has been very inadequate, and of course, we have not taken practical actions to implement the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. It was not until last September, after studying and visiting the National Experience Exchange Conference on Pharmaceutical and Health Technology Revolution, that our understanding of traditional Chinese medicine began to change. In the early stage of this understanding, we only admitted that traditional Chinese medicine was good, so we believed that the possibility of developing traditional Chinese medicine in the field of internal medicine was great, while in surgery, we thought that traditional Chinese medicine was much worse than Western medicine. But after seeing with our own eyes that many patients with acute appendicitis were cured by using traditional Chinese medicine or acupuncture, doubts arose in our minds again: After all, appendicitis is a soft tissue inflammation, and traditional Chinese medicine may be effective in treating soft tissue diseases, but it is not necessarily effective in treating bone trauma. However, facts once again proved that our ideas were wrong. Traditional Chinese medicine does have unique advantages in the treatment of fractures.
    Up to now, across the country, thousands upon thousands of patients with acute appendicitis have been cured by Western medicine doctors using traditional Chinese medicine methods, and many patients with fractures and dislocations have also been cured by traditional Chinese medicine methods. In addition, significant results have been achieved in using traditional Chinese medicine to treat burns, using acupuncture to treat shock, using acupuncture to solve postoperative pain and postoperative urinary retention, as well as complications such as abdominal distension. This series of facts has educated us, enabling us to truly understand traditional Chinese medicine surgery and recognize and affirm the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine surgery in many diseases. But this did not completely solve the contradictory problems we encountered in our actual work. For example, in a specific disease, how to appropriately use traditional Chinese or Western medicine methods, especially when the theories of traditional Chinese and Western medicine conflict. Taking appendicitis as an example, Western medicine is worried about using laxatives, while the treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine include the laxative rhubarb. Taking long bone fractures as another example, Western medicine emphasizes one-time reduction and reliable uninterrupted fixation until the fracture is completely healed, while traditional Chinese medicine needs to replace the fixation of the fracture many times during the treatment process. How should we solve this contradiction that occurs in specific work? The People's Daily pointed out the solution to us very correctly in its editorial on January 25 this year. That is: "Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine can only work together closely and cooperate well to jointly defeat the enemy of disease." This instruction strengthened our confidence in learning traditional Chinese medicine. In learning, we must be humble and sincere, and in practical application, we must be realistic. Everything starts from carrying forward the essence of traditional Chinese medicine and from the interests of the 600 million people.
    Experience has proven that traditional Chinese medicine has a good therapeutic effect on acute appendicitis, and we have no reason to hold skeptical attitudes in our minds; but in the process of using traditional Chinese medicine to treat appendicitis, we also have the responsibility to use modern scientific knowledge and conditions to further determine the indications of traditional Chinese medicine in different stages of appendicitis and the mechanism of its action; when we find that traditional Chinese medicine is not suitable for some cases, we should realistically and timely conduct other methods of treatment. Regarding the treatment of fractures, the internal use of bone-setting pills, external application of plasters, and fixation methods used in traditional Chinese medicine have a promoting effect on fracture healing and functional recovery, which is indeed better than Western medicine, but when traditional Chinese medicine bone-setting therapy can be combined with Western medicine anesthesia, X-ray examination, and other Western medicine measures, the patient's pain will be reduced, and the therapeutic effect will be improved, that is to say, while learning traditional Chinese medicine treatment of bone and joint trauma, we should not forget or obliterate the advantages of Western medicine therapy, and should timely and appropriately combine them whenever possible. In short, the close unity and cooperation, mutual assistance, mutual learning, and learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, to achieve the true integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, being able to walk on "two legs," when two plus two equals five, we will definitely be able to greatly improve the treatment effect.
    Finally, we also realized that exploring and sorting out the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine is not only beneficial to the people of the whole country, but it will also contribute to the working people of the world. As the People's Daily editorial pointed out: "The result of exploring and sorting out our country's medical heritage will undoubtedly enrich our country's modern medical scientific knowledge and facilitate our country's medical scientists to make more creative contributions to modern medicine. ... Obviously, all this is conducive to both the development of national heritage and the development of modern medicine."
    The above are some of our understandings and experiences in learning and implementing the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine in recent years. Our understanding is not deep enough, and our understanding must have incomplete aspects, but we have the determination and confidence, and we will definitely listen to the Party's words and continue to work hard to implement the Party's policy, and our country's medical and health work will definitely achieve greater victories under the correct leadership of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine.

    我们学习中医外科的体会
    孟继懋　兰锡纯方先之　陈景云委员的联合发言
    我们非常兴奋地听到了周总理的政府工作报告。我们认为这是一个响亮的鼓舞全国人民跃进再跃进的号角。我们全国人民，我们的朋友们和全世界爱好和平的人们将为听到了这个号角而欢欣鼓舞，而那些帝国主义者和反动分子们无疑地会更加胆战心惊。听了这个报告后，我们进一步认识了医务工作必须适应整个社会主义建设的需要，这是我们全体医药卫生工作者的光荣任务。
    我们四个人都是外科医生，因此对外科专业如何适应社会主义建设需要的一些问题交换了意见。在交谈中很自然地就谈到西医学习中医的问题上去。最后我们得出一些共同的认识，这些认识可能有错误的地方，希望大家批评和指教。
    党中央在很多年以前就制定了我们党的中医政策。解放后几年来由于我们没有很好的学习，我们对发扬祖国医学遗产的精神体会得非常不够，当然更没有用实际行动来贯彻党的中医政策。直到去年九月间，通过全国医药卫生技术革命经验交流大会的学习和参观之后，我们对祖国医学的认识才开始有所转变。在这认识的初期，我们仅承认中药是好的，因此认为在内科范围内发展中医医学的可能性大，而在外科方面则认为中医比起西医就差得多了。等到亲眼看到好多急性阑尾炎的患者，经过用中药或针灸治好了这个事实后，我们的脑子里又起了疑问：阑尾炎毕竟是一个软组织炎症，中医治软组织的疾病可能成，对治疗骨头的创伤，中医就不一定成。但是，事实再一次证明了我们的想法是错误的，中医对骨折的治疗确有独到之处。
    到目前为止，在全国范围内西医用中医方法治愈了急性阑尾炎的患者已是成千上万，用中医方法治愈骨折脱位的患者为数也很多。此外，用中药治疗烧伤，用针灸治疗休克，用针灸解决手术后的疼痛和手术后的尿潴留以及腹胀等并发症，都有显著的成绩。这一系列的事实教育了我们，使我们真正认识了中医外科，承认了和肯定了中医外科在很多疾患中所起的疗效。但这并未完全解决我们在实际工作中所遇到的矛盾问题。例如在一个具体疾患中如何适时制宜地采用中医或西医的方法，特别是遇到中西医的理论发生抵触的时候。以阑尾炎为例，西医对用泻药是有顾虑的，而在中医的治疗方法药中就有泻药大黄。再以长骨骨干骨折为例，西医强调一次复位，加以确实的不间断的固定直到骨折完全愈合为止，而中医在治疗骨折过程中，对骨折的固定则需要多次进行更换。这种在具体工作中所发生的矛盾，我们应该怎样加以解决呢？人民日报在今年一月二十五日的社论里很正确地给我们指出了解决的方法。那就是：“西医和中医，只有紧密地团结起来，很好地合作，才能共同战胜疾病这个敌人。”这一指示就加强了我们学习中医的信心。在学习中我们要虚心诚恳，在实际应用中要实事求是。一切从发扬祖国医学的精华出发，从六亿人民的利益出发。
    经验已经证明，中医中药对急性阑尾炎有良好的治疗作用，我们没有理由在思想上再抱怀疑态度；但在运用中医中药治疗阑尾炎的过程中，我们还有责任利用现代科学知识和条件，进一步确定中医中药在阑尾炎不同阶段中的适应证及其发生作用的机制；发现中医中药对某一些病例不适应时，我们应该实事求是地和及时地进行其他方法治疗。就骨折的治疗问题来说，中医所用的内服接骨丹，外敷膏药和固定方法，对骨折的愈合和功能的恢复，有促进作用，确有超过西医的地方，但当中医正骨疗法能与西医的麻醉、X光线检查以及其他西医措施相结合时，病人的痛苦更会减少，疗效更加提高，也就是说在学习中医治疗骨关节创伤的同时不应忘掉或抹煞西医疗法中的优点，在可能的情况下应及时地和适宜地相结合。总之，中西医两方面的紧密团结和合作，互相帮助，互相学习，各取其长，各补其短，达到中西医真正合流，能用“两条腿”走路，二加二等于五的时候，我们一定能把治疗效果大大提高。
    最后，我们也认识到了发掘和整理祖国医药宝库，不但对全国人民有利，它对全世界的劳动人民也会有所贡献。正如人民日报社论所指出：“发掘，整理我国医药学遗产的结果，无疑将使我国现代的医药科学知识更加丰富，便于我国的医学家对现代医学作出更多的创造性的贡献。……很明显，这一切是既有利于民族遗产的发扬又利于现代医学的发展的。”
    以上是近年来我们在学习与贯彻党的中医政策方面的一些认识和体会。我们的体会还不深，认识也一定有不够全面的地方，但我们有决心也有信心，我们一定听党的话继续努力执行党的这个政策，我国的医药卫生工作一定能在党的中医政策的正确领导下取得更大的胜利。
