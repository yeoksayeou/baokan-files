    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's report and agree with the reports of the several Vice Premiers.
    Our Jilunzhai People's Commune in Guoyang County, Anhui Province, was established in August last year by merging thirty-two advanced agricultural cooperatives, with the original Shuguang Advanced Cooperative as its foundation. The entire commune has 21,785 households, 87,189 people, and 283,607 mu of cultivated land. Before liberation, this area was a disaster zone described as "three heavy rains flood the village, ten days without rain dries to the lakebed." From 1932 to 1942, we suffered seven floods, three droughts, and one insect plague. The land was also very barren, mostly alkaline land, sandy ridges, and black soil unsuitable for growing crops. The better quality blue soil was scarce. Coupled with crude farming practices at that time, generally only plowing three inches deep and harrowing twice, lacking water and fertilizer, yields were consistently low. In normal years, each mu only yielded 50 or 60 jin, and even in good years, only over 80 jin. Due to poor land and frequent disasters, combined with the landlords' cruel exploitation, the fields were barren, and the people's lives were very hard. In Jilunzhai village alone, 42 out of 75 households frequently fled famine. After liberation, this place underwent earth-shattering changes. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we overcame years of disasters and rapidly developed production. By 1957, the average grain yield per mu had increased from tens of jin in the past to 220 jin, a three-fold increase compared to before liberation. In 1958, the yield reached 369 jin per mu, an increase of 67 percent compared to 1957, and a five-fold increase compared to before liberation. Industry and sideline occupations have also greatly developed. In 1958, the net income of commune members increased by 30 percent compared to 1957, exceeding the living standards of local well-to-do middle peasants by 31 percent. The original poorest Jilunzhai Brigade was even more prominent. Last year, the total income averaged 236.1 yuan per person. The commune's welfare undertakings brought huge benefits to the members. After the implementation of the public dining system last year, the public canteen served two or three dishes per meal, with an extra meal once a week. During festivals, chicken, fish, meat, eggs, and wine were all available. The entire brigade also newly established two primary schools and a health clinic, and built a library, a club, a radio station, a sports field, and a garden. After production, every commune member has the opportunity to participate in cultural and recreational activities, making life rich and colorful.
    In such a "poor" place, how could we have turned around economically and changed our impoverished face in just a few years? The key is that under the leadership of the Party, we established the determination to overcome difficulties through self-reliance. Chairman Mao said, "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work hard, to make revolution," which is absolutely correct. In the past, our "poverty" did bring us many difficulties, but conversely, "poverty" also motivated us and made us determined to be self-reliant. From the establishment of mutual aid teams in 1951 to the period of agricultural cooperation, we constantly paid attention to educating the members about "self-reliance." Everyone expressed the desire to rely on their own hands and the power of organization, following the path of mutual aid and cooperation indicated by the Party, to continuously transform natural conditions and strive to develop production.
    In transforming nature, in order to get rid of the disaster-prone situation of being easily flooded and drought-stricken, we began large-scale construction of farmland water conservancy projects in 1951, and have now basically eliminated general drought and flood disasters. Taking the current Jilunzhai Brigade (i.e., the original Shuguang First Cooperative) as an example, this brigade dug a medium ditch and seven small ditches in the winter and spring of 1951 alone, completing 115,000 cubic meters of earthwork. In 1956, it began to dig large ditches and ponds. In 1957, based on this foundation and according to the requirements of the provincial Party committee to realize "river networkization and rice cultivation" and "turn Huaibei into Jiangnan," it launched an unprecedented large-scale water conservancy construction movement, working hard throughout the winter and spring, completing more than 917,500 cubic meters of earthwork. During this year's water conservancy construction, we encountered many unimaginable difficulties, but ultimately, due to the great ambition of the vast number of members and the collective wisdom they displayed, we successively braved wind, snow, and severe cold, and overcame the sandy ridge barrier, the sticky mud barrier, and the quicksand barrier. The soil layer in this team was thin. When digging the ditch to a depth of more than two meters, a layer of sandy ridge, as hard as stone, was encountered. Shovels could not dig it, and grappling hooks could not break it open. One small team broke eleven grappling hooks in two hours. After mobilizing the masses to study, they found cracks in the yellow mud protruding from the sandy ridge, and used shovels and picks to pry along the cracks, finally opening up the sandy ridge layer. Next came the sticky mud barrier. This kind of mud stuck to the shovel and could not be shaken off, and stuck to the basket and could not be dumped, greatly reducing work efficiency. Later, the members came up with the idea of dipping the shovel in water and changing the basket to a cloth bag, and the sticky mud more than a foot deep was quickly conquered. Subsequently, when the ditch was dug to a depth of five meters, they encountered loose quicksand. When it was dug here, it would silt up there. The members came up with the method of "diverting sand and separating water," first digging a ditch to filter out the water from the quicksand before controlling the quicksand. In order to improve the efficiency of digging deep ditches for river networkization, we also mobilized everyone to contribute ideas, boldly create, and innovate earth-moving tools. We widely promoted "derricks," "aerial earth-moving devices," and "pulley carts." Later, we further modified the "derrick" into a "derrick pulley," changed aerial earth-moving into "Jade Girl Shuttle," and created an "automatic loading and unloading earth-moving device" on the basis of the trolley, completely eliminating shoulder carrying and manual lifting, increasing the daily work efficiency per person to 13 cubic meters. After the establishment of the commune last year, we opened four more rivers, and the entire team realized river networkization. These projects can guarantee the use of 9,000 mu of paddy fields, no drought for 100 days without rain, and no flooding for five consecutive days of heavy rain of 300 mm. Moreover, they have developed transportation, aquaculture, and other diversified economic production, turning the Jilunzhai People's Commune into a land of fish and rice. The members praised: "Realizing river networkization, we are not afraid of drought or flood. Sufficient water can raise fish, guaranteeing the harvest of crops. Transportation does not require people to carry, sitting on the boat laughing happily."
    Transforming alkaline wasteland and using pig manure to neutralize sandy ridges are other important measures we have taken to transform nature and achieve high yields. Jilunzhai is surrounded by barren alkaline land. To develop production, it is necessary to transform these poor lands. Over the past few years, through continuous exploration and experimentation, we have found several effective methods to improve a large amount of alkaline land. However, when the idea of improving alkaline land was first proposed in 1951, some people did not believe that alkaline land could be improved. They said, "Barren alkaline land is always barren alkaline land, and it will never be able to turn over." In order to educate these people with facts, we mobilized young people to use the method of padding the land with guest soil, first digging out the alkaline soil on a piece of alkaline land, and then padding a layer of five to six inches of new soil on top. After careful cultivation and fertilization, we planted cotton (native cotton) for the first time and harvested more than 40 jin. This fact broke the conservative idea that alkaline land could not be improved. Then, we began large-scale improvement. In the process of digging and padding soil, we found that the alkaline soil layer was not deep in some places. As long as we deeply plowed seven or eight inches, we could turn the alkaline soil down. Therefore, we adopted the method of digging ditches and turning the soil, greatly accelerating the progress of improving alkaline land. With the implementation of the three agricultural reforms (i.e., changing to planting high-yield crops, increasing the proportion of mid-season crops, and changing the habit of extensive planting and low yields), we also achieved good results by building terraced fields on those relatively low-lying alkaline lands, raising the soil blocks, and using rainwater to flush them. In 1954, we discovered that planting rice in alkaline land and frequently irrigating and draining water can also change the alkalinity. Using the above methods, and working hard year after year, good crops grew on many alkaline lands, turning no harvest into a harvest. In order to control sandy ridge soil, the members created the method of using pig manure to neutralize sandy ridges. Generally, applying several thousand jin of pig manure and pig urine per mu of sandy ridge land can gradually soften the hard sandy ridge and double the yield. This method has been promoted.
    In cultivation, we first greatly expanded the area of mid-season crops (summer harvest crops). Before liberation, wheat only accounted for 40 percent of the cultivated land in our area. After the implementation of "three reforms" in 1953, it expanded to more than 78 percent, thus avoiding the disasters of summer and autumn in previous years and stabilizing the harvest. Secondly, we vigorously changed to planting high-yield crops, combined with the construction of water conservancy projects, changing to planting rice in alkaline land near water sources; planting "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes in the improved land; and changing to planting corn in blue soil. This greatly increased the yield per unit area. For example, in 1955, when rice was first planted, each mu yielded 430 jin, several times more than planting dry land grain. Thirdly, we used intercropping methods to improve land utilization. In the past, the land utilization rate was very low, mostly one crop a year. After the implementation of intercropping, it was generally possible to plant four or five crops in two years, and the land utilization rate increased by 201 percent. Fourthly, we actively changed the habit of extensive planting and low yields, accumulated more fertilizer, made more fertilizer, applied fertilizer rationally, and practiced intensive cultivation. We not only achieved deep plowing, multiple plowing, fine harrowing, and multiple harrowing, but also changed the original vertical plowing to vertical and horizontal cross-plowing, and changed the original horizontal harrowing to horizontal and vertical cross-harrowing. In this way, the land was plowed deeply, harrowed evenly, and the seedlings emerged neatly and vigorously. At the same time, we also widely changed to using improved varieties and changed the original sparse planting to rational close planting. Due to the adoption of this series of effective measures, the door to increasing production was opened, and grain production increased year by year.
    In order to quickly turn around economically, while transforming nature and striving to change agricultural crops from low-yield to high-yield, we also actively developed industry and diversified economic production. In 1958, the total output value of sideline occupations reached more than 7 million yuan, with a net income of more than 3.56 million yuan, averaging 41 yuan per person, an increase of 2.5 times compared to 1957. The Jilunzhai Brigade has a very large scale of diversified operations. Since 1957, this brigade has gradually established 101 large and small factories serving agriculture, including agricultural machinery repair and assembly, oil processing, native chemical fertilizer, granular fertilizer, native cement, biogas power generation, bee farms, silkworm farms, milk farms, and others. In addition, they also actively advocated eight plantings (planting fruit trees, reeds, vitex, willows, cattails, daylily, lotus roots, water chestnuts) and seven raisings (raising pigs, chickens, sheep, silkworms, rabbits, fish, bees, etc.). In 1958, the entire team raised more than 11,000 pigs, averaging 11.2 pigs per household; raised more than 3,590 sheep, averaging 3.5 sheep per household; and raised 32,136 poultry, averaging 32 poultry per household. The fish farm area was 80 mu, raising 640,000 fish, averaging 40 jin per person. Due to the development of diversified economy, the income of this brigade has increased year by year, gradually improving the lives of the members and continuously promoting agricultural production. In 1957, the income from sideline occupations was used to purchase 74 horse-drawn waterwheels, 13 carts, 42 dragon-bone waterwheels, 24 draft animals, 94 plows and rakes, 100,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, and other agricultural implements.
    Our commune, after several years of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, has turned water disasters into water conservancy, turned low-lying areas into fertile fields, turned no harvest into more harvest, and turned low yield into high yield, and life is more prosperous than before. But we know that this is still far from the communist affluent life that the Party has pointed out to us, and there is still great potential in production to be further tapped. Therefore, in order to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, all members have set out the indicators for achieving a greater leap forward this year, determined to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin of grain per mu, 115 jin of ginned cotton, and 741 jin of oilseeds, and to gradually implement gardenization, field gardenization, irrigation channelization, and transportation vehicle and boatization on the basis of achieving river networkization, turning the Jilunzhai People's Commune into a beautiful garden and a land of abundant food and clothing. The people of our Jilunzhai People's Commune have the correct leadership of the Party, the experience of overcoming difficulties over the years, and greater enthusiasm than last year. We are fully confident in achieving this year's production targets and moving towards a more prosperous life.

专栏：

    我们的公社正在由穷变富
    纪明选代表的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的报告，同意几位副总理的报告。
    我们安徽省涡阳县纪伦寨人民公社，是去年八月间以原曙光高级社为基础，由三十二个高级社合并建成的。全公社共有二万一千七百八十五户，八万七千一百八十九人，二十八万三千六百零七亩耕地。解放以前，我们这个地方是一个“三场大雨淹到庄上，十天不雨干到湖底”的灾区，从一九三二年到一九四二年十年中，就发生七次涝灾，三次旱灾，一次虫灾。土地也非常瘠薄，大部分是不长庄稼的碱地、砂矼地和黑土地；土质较好的青土地数量很少，加以那时耕作粗糙，一般地只耕三寸，耙两遍，缺水少肥，产量一向很低，正常年景，每亩地只收五、六十斤，好年景每亩也只收八十多斤。由于地孬灾多，加上地主残酷剥削，田地荒芜，人民生活很苦。纪伦寨本庄有七十五户人家，解放前经常逃荒的就有四十二户。解放后，这里发生了翻天复地的变革，我们在共产党的领导下，战胜了连年的灾荒，迅速发展了生产，到一九五七年粮食平均亩产量已由过去几十斤提高到二百二十斤，比解放前增加了三倍；一九五八年单产达到三百六十九斤，比一九五七年增长百分之六十七，比解放前增加五倍。工业和副业也有很大的发展。一九五八年社员纯收入比一九五七年增加了百分之三十，超过了当地富裕中农生活水平百分之三十一。原来最穷的纪伦寨大队更为突出，去年的总收入每人平均达二百三十六元一角，公社福利事业给社员带来了巨大的利益，去年全队实行伙食供给制以后，公共食堂每餐都是两三个菜，每周加餐一次，逢年过节，鸡鱼肉蛋酒样样俱全。全队还新办了两所小学、一个卫生所，新建了图书馆、俱乐部、收音站、体育场和花园，生产以后，每个社员都有机会进行文化娱乐活动，生活丰富多采。
    在这样一个“穷”地方，为什么能在短短几年里从经济上翻过身来，改变了贫穷的面貌呢？关键是我们在党的领导下，树立了自力更生战胜困难的决心。毛主席说：“穷则思变，要干，要革命”，这话是十分正确的。过去我们那里“穷”，的确给我们带来了许多困难，但反过来，“穷”也激励了我们，使我们立下自力更生的志气。从一九五一年办互助组到农业合作化这个期间，我们经常注意向社员进行“自力更生”的教育，大家都表示要依靠自己的双手和组织起来的力量，沿着党所指引的互助合作的道路，不断改造自然条件，努力发展生产。
    在改造自然上，我们为了摆脱易涝易旱的多灾局面，从一九五一年就开始大规模的兴修农田水利，现已基本上消除了一般的旱涝灾害。以现在的纪伦寨大队（即原曙光一社）为例，这个大队在一九五一年一冬一春，就挖了一条中沟，七条小沟，完成十一万五千公方土；一九五六年，开始挖大沟大塘；一九五七年在这个基础上，根据省委提出的实现“河网化水稻化”“把淮北变成江南”的要求，开展了规模空前的兴修水利运动，大干一冬春，做了九十一万七千五百多公方土，在这年兴修水利中遇到了许多难以想像的困难，但终因广大社员的志气大，发挥了集体的智慧，曾先后冒着风雪严寒，战胜了砂矼关、粘泥关、流沙关。这个队的土层薄，当挖沟挖到二公尺多深时，一层砂矼板比石头还硬。锹挖不动，爪钩刨不开。有个小队两小时就挖坏了十一把爪钩。经发动群众研究，从砂矼上冒黄泥的地方找到裂缝，用铁锹铁镐顺缝挖撬，才扒开砂矼层。接着而来的是粘泥关，这种泥沾住锹甩不掉，沾住筐倒不了，使工效大大降低。后来社员想出锹沾水挖，筐改用布兜子的办法，一尺多深的粘泥，才很快被征服。随后，当沟挖到五公尺深，又遇到稀稀糊糊的流沙，这里挖掉，那里又淤平，社员又想出“调沙离水”的办法，先挖出一条沟，滤去流沙中的水分，才制服了流沙。为了提高河网化开挖深沟的工效，当时我们还发动人人献计，大胆创造，革新运土工具。大量推广了“吊杆”、“空中运土器”和“滑轮车”。后来又进一步把“吊杆”改制成“吊杆滑轮”，把空中运土改成“玉女穿梭”，并在滑车的基础上，创制了“自动装卸运土器”，全部消灭了肩挑人抬，使每人日工效提高到十三公方。去年公社成立以后，我们又开了四条河，全队实现了河网化。这些工程可以保证九千亩水稻用水、百日不雨不旱，五天连降大雨三百公厘不涝；而且发展了交通运输和养鱼、鸭等多种经济生产，把纪伦寨人民公社变成了鱼米之乡。社员们赞扬说：“实现河网化，旱涝都不怕，水足能养鱼，保证收庄稼，运输不用人来挑，坐在船上笑哈哈。”
    改造碱荒地，猪屎化砂矼，是我们改造自然，取得丰产的又一重要措施。纪伦寨周围尽是荒碱地，要发展生产，必须改造这些孬地。几年来，经过不断的摸索试验，我们找到好几种有效的办法，改良了大量的碱地。但在一九五一年最初提出改良碱地时，有些人不相信碱地能改良，他们说：“老碱荒总是老碱荒，永世翻不了身。”为了用事实教育这些人，我们发动青年群众用客土垫地的办法，在一块碱地上先挖掉碱土，上面垫一层五至六寸的新土，经过精耕细耙多施肥，第一次种上棉花（土棉）收了四十多斤。这一事实打破了碱地不能改良的保守思想。接着，就开始进行了大面积的改良。在挖土垫土过程中，我们发现有些地方碱土层不深，只要深耕七、八寸，就可以把碱土翻下去，于是我们又采取挖沟翻土的办法，大大加快了改良碱地的进度。随着农业三项改革（即改种高产作物，提高午季作物种植比重，改变广种薄收习惯）的推行，我们对那些比较低洼的碱地，用筑台田，提高土块，利用雨水冲刷，也取得了很好的效果。一九五四年我们又发现碱地改种水稻，经常灌水排水也可改变碱性。运用上面几个办法，经过逐年的苦干，原来许多碱地上长出了好庄稼，使无收变成了有收。社员为了制服砂矼土，创造了猪屎化砂矼的办法，一般在每亩砂矼地里上几千斤猪屎猪尿，可以使硬砂矼逐渐松软，产量提高一倍左右，这个办法已推广开来。
    在耕作上，我们首先大大扩大了午季作物（夏收作物）面积。解放前，我们那里小麦只占耕地面积百分之四十，一九五三年推行“三改”以后，扩大到百分之七十八以上，这样就避开了历年夏秋的灾害，稳定了收成。其次，是大力改种高产作物，结合兴修水利，在靠近水源的碱地里改种水稻；在经过改良的地里大种“胜利百号”红芋；在青土地里改种玉米，这就大大提高了单位面积产量，如一九五五年首次改种水稻，每亩收四百三十斤，比种旱粮增加几倍。第三，运用套种方法提高土地利用率。过去土地利用率很低，大部分是一年一季，推行套种后，普遍做到两年种四、五季，土地利用率提高百分之二百零一。第四，积极改变广种薄收的习惯，多积肥、多造肥，合理施肥，实行精耕细作，不仅做到深耕、多耕、细耙、多耙，而且改原来竖耕为竖横交错耕，改原来横耙为横竖交错耙，这样地耕的深，耙的匀，苗出的齐出的旺。同时还普遍改用优良品种，并改原来稀插为合理密植。由于采取了这一连串的有效措施，就打开了增产大门，粮食产量逐年上升。
    为了在经济上迅速翻身，我们在改造自然，力争农作物由低产变高产的同时，还积极发展工业和多种经济生产。一九五八年副业总产值已达七百余万元，纯收入三百五十六万多元，平均每人达四十一元，比一九五七年增加二点五倍。纪伦寨大队多种经营的规模很大，这个大队从一九五七年就逐步办起农具修配、油料加工、土化肥、颗粒肥料，土水泥、沼气发电、养蜂场、养蚕场、牛奶场，以及其他为农业服务的大小工厂一百零一个。此外，他们还积极提倡八栽（栽果木树、芦苇、荆条、柳条、蒲草、黄花草、藕、菱角）、七养（养猪、鸡、羊、蚕、兔、鱼、蜂等），一九五八年全队共养猪一万一千多头，平均每户十一点二头；养羊三千五百九十多只，平均每户三点五只；养家禽三万二千一百三十六只，平均每户三十二只。养鱼场面积八十亩，养鱼六十四万尾，平均每人有四十斤。由于多种经济的发展，这个大队的收入年年增加，既逐步改善了社员生活，又不断促进了农业生产，一九五七年利用副业收入即购买了七十四部马拉水车、十三辆大车、四十二部龙骨水车、二十四头耕畜、九十四张犁耙、十万斤化肥和其他各种农具。
    我们这个公社，经过几年来苦干、实干、巧干，已经变水患为水利，变洼地为良田，变不收为多收，变低产为高产，生活比以前富裕了。但我们知道这距离党向我们指出的共产主义的富裕生活还远的很，生产上也还有极大的潜力要继续挖掘，因此，为了实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进，全体社员已订出了实现今年更大跃进的指标，决心实现亩产粮食千斤、皮棉一百一十五斤、油料七百四十一斤，并在实现河网化的基础上逐步实行园林化，园田化，灌溉渠道化，交通运输车船化，把纪伦寨人民公社改变为美丽的花园和丰衣足粮之乡。我们纪伦寨人民公社的人民有党的正确领导，有历年战胜困难的经验，有比去年更大的干劲，我们完全有把握实现今年各项生产指标，走向更富裕的生活道路。
