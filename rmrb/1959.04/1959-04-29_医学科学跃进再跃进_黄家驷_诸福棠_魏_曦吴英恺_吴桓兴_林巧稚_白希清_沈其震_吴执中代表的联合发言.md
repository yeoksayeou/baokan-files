Fellow Representatives:

After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Financial Statement and the 1959 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report on the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, we unanimously agree with and support these reports.

Premier Zhou's report pointed out that an unprecedented leap forward in the national economy occurred in China's history in 1958. The increase in the output of many industrial and agricultural products in one year, 1958, exceeded the increase in five years during the First Five-Year Plan, and people's communes integrating industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and combining government and commune, emerged in rural areas across the country. Premier Zhou's report also pointed out that with the advent of the socialist economic high tide, a socialist cultural high tide began to rise in our country. In 1958, China made significant progress in education, culture, health, science and technology. We are engaged in medical science work, and from the work of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, we deeply realize that 1958 was also a year of great leap forward in medical science. After the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences merged with the former Peking Union Medical College in October 1957, it developed rapidly in 1958 against the backdrop of the nationwide great leap forward and on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement. It grew from the original two research institutes, one hospital, and ten departments to ten research institutes, five hospitals, and three departments, engaged in research in basic medicine, clinical medicine, preventive medicine, and pharmacy, gradually forming a relatively complete medical research center.

	Conducting In-Depth Research at Extensive Sites Such as Factories, Mines, and Rural Areas, Serving Production and Construction with Science and Technology

One of the important signs of the leap forward in medical scientific research in 1958 was the implementation of the policy of serving production and construction with science and technology. Research in basic, clinical, preventive, and pharmaceutical departments moved from the narrow confines of laboratories, wards, and certain small-scale pilot sites to large-scale sites, penetrating factories, mines, construction sites, forest areas, rural people's communes, and urban street families, facing the vast working class and peasantry, closely integrating theory with practice, and playing an important role in guiding practical prevention and control work.

In the prevention and control of the five major parasitic diseases, the Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences organized seven working groups to conduct research on key issues in Anhui and Hainan Island. In order to ensure the health of laborers in newly developed areas, new industrial bases, and national defense borders, the Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, in collaboration with other institutions, sent survey teams to eleven provinces, one city, and three autonomous regions to investigate the prevalence of diseases and their epidemic factors, in order to formulate comprehensive prevention and control plans. The rural people's commune health work team organized by relevant units of the entire academy took two people's communes in Anguo County, Hebei Province, as its base to carry out research work on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major infectious diseases, in order to summarize a relatively complete health construction plan for rural people's communes. In order to protect the health of workers in factories and mines, the Institute of Labor Hygiene, Labor Protection, and Occupational Diseases sent a work team to Dajishan in Jiangxi to conduct research on the prevention and control of silicosis. Researchers in nutritional surveys and food hygiene have set foot in all provinces of the country except Tibet and Qinghai. Researchers in the prevention and control of venereal diseases and leprosy are distributed in seven provinces and two autonomous regions. Research on tumors and hypertension is also combined with resident census work.

Because the research work penetrates the front lines, and theory is closely integrated with practice, relatively significant research achievements can be obtained in a relatively short period of time. For example, in terms of eliminating the four pests, a water surface fumigant was created so that the smoke can contact the water surface to kill mosquito larvae; eight rodenticides and six flea killers were found from a large number of wild plants and traditional Chinese medicines. In the prevention and control of the five major parasitic diseases, on the basis of studying various major links, a snail eradication plan for reed marshes, which is of great significance for eliminating schistosomiasis, as well as plans for eliminating malaria, filariasis, kala-azar, and hookworm disease, were formulated. In terms of occupational disease prevention and control, through on-site work, dust in mining areas has been reduced to below the allowable concentration. In the field of hypertension, prevention and control research has been carried out in certain areas, and combined with the prevention and control work in these areas, some preliminary data has been obtained on the etiology and pathogenesis of hypertension through examinations of higher nervous activity, autonomic nerve function, and body fluids, providing clues for further exploration of the etiology and pathogenesis. In the area of malignant tumors, through the general survey of a large number of residents, not only the effect of early detection of patients and early treatment was achieved, but also some factors related to the incidence of the disease were discovered. These studies not only solved practical problems, but also improved scientific theory.

	Strengthening Scientific Theoretical Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine on the Basis of Summarizing Treatment Effects

Another sign of the leap forward in medical scientific research in 1958 is the research and promotion of traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, qigong, massage, and other treatments, has been widely used in medical institutions throughout the country. Taking Peking Union Medical College Hospital as an example, traditional Chinese medicine is used to treat more than 50 kinds of diseases, and acupuncture is used to treat more than 20 kinds. Acupuncture treatment for asthma, angina pectoris, tachycardia, pulseless disease, sequelae of infantile paralysis, and ferrous sulfate treatment for trachoma have all shown good results. On the basis of combining learning and application, integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatments have been gradually developed, such as the treatment of cerebral thrombosis, neurasthenia, acute mastitis, and autumn diarrhea in children, which have better effects than using traditional Chinese medicine alone or Western medicine alone. For traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture treatment for hypertension, appendicitis, acupuncture treatment for sequelae of infantile paralysis, qigong treatment for peptic ulcer, uterine pills for cervical erosion and pelvic organ prolapse, and other treatments, on the basis of summarizing the curative effects, further research on the mechanism of action has begun, which is the research using modern scientific methods to explain the theory of traditional Chinese medicine.

	Carrying out Mass Scientific Research

Breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, and launching vigorous mass movements, replacing the past situation of a small number of experts doing research work in a cold and quiet manner with a vigorous mass-based research approach, is another important sign of the leap forward in medical scientific research in 1958. The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences launched three upsurges of presenting gifts to the Party on "July 1st," "November," and New Year's Day in 1959, achieving a total of 4,020 items in scientific research, medical care, instrument manufacturing, technological innovation, and compiling teaching materials, papers, and works, of which 514 items belonged to scientific research achievements. Due to the mobilization of the masses, the Youth Anti-Cancer Commando Team statistically analyzed 27,000 tumor cases and completed clinical pathological morphological studies of 1,895 cases of cervical cancer within four weeks, proposing a new classification method. Due to breaking superstitions, inspired by the glorious deeds of Shanghai Second Medical College Affiliated Guangci Hospital in rescuing the life of worker Qiu Cai Kang, Peking Union Medical College Hospital rescued 165 patients who were previously considered difficult to save, and 94 of these 165 patients were fully recovered. Extracting antihypertensive drugs from Rauwolfia, synthesizing cortisone from sisal extracts, producing ergot alkaloids by artificial fermentation, cultivating aureomycin using local methods, manufacturing erythromycin and gibberellin using new methods, and manufacturing dextran, which can replace plasma, using local methods, were all research topics that were previously considered difficult to complete, but they were all completed in a short period of time.

Why did medical scientific research make such a big leap forward in 1958? The most important reason is the establishment of the Party's absolute leadership over scientific undertakings. Before and in the early stages of the rectification movement, not only did right-wing elements say with ulterior motives: "The Party cannot lead science," "Laymen cannot lead experts," but many scientists who were willing to take the socialist road did not completely agree with the Party's views on certain specific issues related to scientific research. When the Party proposed that scientific research must serve politics and production and construction, they said that science is above politics and should be for science's sake. When the Party proposed that scientific research must be carried out in a planned manner, they said that planning would bind the development of science. When the Party proposed that research work must follow the mass line, they said that research work can only be done by experienced scientists, and even more cannot be carried out in the manner of launching movements. When the Party issued the call to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, they said that scientific research work has its unchangeable laws. When the Party called on Western medicine to learn from traditional Chinese medicine and inherit and carry forward the medicine of the motherland, they said that traditional Chinese medicine is unscientific. Only after the great victory of the rectification and anti-rightist movement, and the establishment of the Party's absolute leadership over scientific research work, can the Party's policies be thoroughly implemented and scientific undertakings flourish.

The achievements of medical scientific research in the past year are huge, but compared with the needs of the people's health undertakings and the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, our work is far from enough. We must make greater efforts in 1959, under the leadership of the Party, continue to implement the mass line, give full play to the positive factors in all aspects, go all out, and strive to complete the scientific and technological tasks that directly serve production and construction, while developing cutting-edge science and technology and paying attention to the research of basic theories, so as to ensure industrial and agricultural production and improve the level of medical science. China's medical scientific research team is growing stronger day by day. By the end of 1958, there were 108 medical scientific research institutions in the country, 2.85 times the 38 in 1957. As far as we know, nine provinces including Hubei, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Jilin, Shanxi, Shandong, and Hebei have established local academies of medical sciences. National medical colleges and various medical and preventive institutions are also vigorously carrying out scientific research work. Achieving a greater leap forward in 1959 is conditional. Let us unite and strengthen cooperation to achieve greater achievements in medical science and greet our great 10th National Day with a new health outlook!

Finally, we medical workers feel extremely angry about the armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper reactionary group, the kidnapping of the Dalai Lama, and the conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists to split Tibet from China. We fully support the State Council's order of March 28 on suppressing the Tibetan rebellion and disbanding the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion. Now, the Tibetan rebellion has been basically quelled, and scattered bandits will be eliminated soon. A new era of national regional autonomy in Tibet has arrived, and we medical workers guarantee to contribute our strength to the health and happiness of the Tibetan compatriots.

    医学科学跃进再跃进
    黄家驷　诸福棠　魏　曦吴英恺　吴桓兴　林巧稚  白希清　沈其震　吴执中代表的联合发言各位代表：
    听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年度国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告，我们一致同意并拥护这些报告。
    周总理的报告中指出：一九五八年出现了我国历史上前所未有的国民经济大跃进。许多工农业产品的产量在一九五八年一年增加的数量超过了第一个五年计划期间五年增加的数量，而且在全国农村中，出现了工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社。周总理的报告中也指出：随着社会主义的经济高潮的到来，在我国开始兴起了一个社会主义的文化高潮。一九五八年我国在教育、文化、卫生和科学技术等方面都有了飞跃的发展。我们是从事医学科学工作的，从中国医学科学院的工作来看，我们深切体会到，一九五八年也是医学科学大跃进的一年。中国医学科学院在一九五七年十月与前中国协和医学院合并后，一九五八年在全国各方面大跃进的形势下和整风运动胜利的基础上有了较快的发展，从原有的两个研究所、一个医院和十个学系，发展为十个研究所、五个医院和三个学系，从事于基础医学、临床医学、预防医学、药学各方面的研究，逐渐形成一个比较完整的医学研究中心。
    深入工矿农村等广大现场研究，科学技术为生产建设服务
    一九五八年医学科学研究工作跃进的重要标志之一，是贯彻了科学技术为生产建设服务的方针。基础、临床、预防和药学各部门的研究，从过去狭窄的、只关在实验室里、只限于病房里和某些小型的试点现场，进入到大规模的现场，深入工厂、矿山、工地、林区、农村的人民公社、城市的街道家庭，面向广大工农劳动人民，使理论密切结合实际，对指导实际的防治工作起了重要作用。
    在防治五大寄生虫病方面，中国医学科学院寄生虫病研究所，组织了七个工作组，在安徽和海南岛进行关键性问题的研究。为了保证新开发地区、新工业基地和国防边境劳动人民的健康，流行病学微生物学研究所与其他机构协作，派出调查队至十一个省、一个市和三个自治区进行疾病流行情况和流行因素的调查，以制订综合性防治方案。由全院有关单位组织的农村人民公社卫生工作队，以河北省安国县两个人民公社为基地，开展除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要传染病的研究工作，以总结出一套较完整的农村人民公社卫生建设方案。为了保护工矿工人的健康，劳动卫生，劳动保护及职业病研究所派工作队到江西大吉山进行矽肺防治的研究。营养调查及食品卫生的研究人员，除西藏、青海以外，全国各省都有他们的足迹。防治性病、麻疯的研究人员分布在七个省和两个自治区。肿瘤和高血压的研究也都和地区居民普查工作结合进行。
    由于研究工作深入现场，理论密切结合实际，就能在较短期间内取得比较显著的研究成就。例如在除四害方面，创造了水上烟剂，使发烟能接触水面以杀灭蚊幼虫；从大量野生植物及中药中找出了八种灭鼠和六种灭蚤药物。在防治五大寄生虫病方面，在研究各个主要环节的基础上，拟定了对消灭血吸虫病有重要意义的芦滩灭螺方案，以及消灭疟疾、丝虫病、黑热病、钩虫病的方案。在职业病防治方面，通过现场工作，矿区的粉尘已降至允许浓度之下。在高血压病方面，开展了地段的防治研究，并结合地段的防治工作，在高血压病的病因及发病条件方面，通过高级神经活动、植物性神经机能及体液的检查，获得了一些初步的资料，为进一步探讨病因及发病机制提供了线索。在恶性肿瘤方面，通过广大居民的普查工作，不仅获得了早期发现病人和早期治疗的效果，而且也发现了一些与发病有关的因素。这些研究既解决了实际问题，也提高了科学理论。
    在总结治疗效果的基础上，加强中医中药的科学理论研究
    一九五八年医学科学研究工作跃进的另一标志是中医中药的研究和发扬。中医中药包括针灸、气功、推拿等的治疗工作已在全国各地医疗机构中广泛应用。以北京协和医院为例，运用中医中药治疗的疾病达五十余种，针灸治疗达二十余种。针灸治疗哮喘、心绞疼、心动过速、无脉症、小儿麻痹后遗症、化铁丹治疗砂眼，效果均良好。在学与用结合的基础上，已逐步开展了中西医综合治疗，如治疗脑血栓形成、神经衰弱、急性乳腺炎、儿童秋季腹泻等的效果，均较单用中医方法或单用西医方法为好，对中医中药、针灸治疗高血压、阑尾炎，针灸治疗小儿麻痹后遗症，气功治疗消化性溃疡，子宫丸治疗子宫糜烂、盆器脱垂等，在总结疗效的基础上，已开始进一步地进行作用机制的研究，这是用现代科学方法阐明中医理论的研究。
    开展群众性的科学研究
    破除迷信、解放思想、大搞群众运动，以轰轰烈烈的群众性搞研究的方法代替过去的少数专家冷冷清清的搞研究工作的局面，是一九五八年医学科学研究工作跃进的又一重要标志。中国医学科学院于一九五八年“七一”、“十一、”及一九五九年元旦掀起了三次向党献礼的热潮，在科学研究、医疗保健、仪器制造、技术革新，以及编写教材论文著作等方面共达四千零二十项，其中属于科学研究成果方面有五百十四项。由于发动了群众，青年抗癌突击队在四周内统计分析了二万七千人分肿瘤病例和完成了一千八百九十五例子宫颈癌的临床病理形态学的研究，提出了新的分类法。由于破除了迷信，在上海第二医学院附属广慈医院创造了抢救工人丘财康生命的光辉事迹的鼓舞下，协和医院抢救了一百六十五名过去认为难以挽救的病人，在这一百六十五名病人中有九十四名获得全愈。由罗芙木中提取降血压药物，从剑麻提取物中合成考的松，用人工发酵方法产生麦角碱，用土法培养地霉素，用新方法制造红霉素和赤霉素，用土法制造可以代替血浆的右旋糖酐，都是过去认为难以完成的研究课题，可是都在短期内完成了。
    为什么医学科学研究在一九五八年会有这样大的跃进呢？最主要的原因是党对科学事业绝对领导的树立。在整风运动之前和整风运动初期，不但是右派分子别有用心地说：“党不能领导科学”，“外行不能领导内行”，许多愿意走社会主义道路的科学家们在有关科学研究工作的若干具体问题上，和党的看法并不是完全一致的。当党提出科学研究必须为政治服务、为生产建设服务时，他们说，科学是超政治的，应为科学而科学。当党提出科学研究必须有计划地进行时，他们说，计划会束缚了科学的发展。当党提出研究工作必须走群众路线时，他们说，研究工作只能由有经验的科学家来做，更不能用搞运动的方式来进行。当党提出敢想、敢说、敢做的号召时，他们说，科学研究工作有它的不可改变的规律。当党号召西医学习中医，继承和发扬祖国医学时，他们说，中医是不科学的。只有在整风反右派获得伟大胜利、党对科学研究工作树立绝对领导以后，党的方针政策才能彻底贯彻，科学事业才能蓬勃地发展。
    一年来医学科学研究工作的成绩是巨大的，但是，对于人民卫生事业的需要来说，以及和我国工农业生产大跃进来比，我们的工作是很不够的。我们在一九五九年必须作更大的努力，在党的领导下，继续贯彻群众路线，充分发挥各方面的积极因素，鼓足干劲，力争完成直接为生产建设服务的科学技术任务，同时发展尖端科学技术，注意基础理论的研究，以保证工农业生产建设并提高医学科学水平。我国医学科学的研究队伍正在日益壮大，到一九五八年底为止，全国已有医学科学研究机构一百零八所，为一九五七年三十八所的二点八五倍。据我们所知的，全国已有湖北、陕西、江西、江苏、辽宁、吉林、山西、山东、河北等九省建立了地方的医学科学院。全国医药学院和各医疗预防机关也在大力开展科学研究工作。实现一九五九年更大的跃进是有条件的。让我们团结起来，加强协作，在医学科学方面取得更大的成就，以崭新的卫生面貌来迎接我们伟大的国庆十周年！
    最后，我们医务工作者对于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动武装叛乱，劫持达赖喇嘛，和帝国主义者、印度扩张主义分子企图把西藏从中国分裂出去的阴谋，感到无比的愤怒。我们完全拥护国务院三月二十八日关于平息西藏叛乱，解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的命令。现在，西藏叛乱已经基本平息，零散叛匪不日即可肃清，实行西藏民族区域自治的新时期已经来到，我们医务工作者保证为藏族同胞的健康和幸福贡献出自己的力量。
