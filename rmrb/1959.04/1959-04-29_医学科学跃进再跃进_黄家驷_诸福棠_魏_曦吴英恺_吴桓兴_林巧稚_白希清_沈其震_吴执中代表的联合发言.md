Fellow Representatives:

After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Financial Statement and the 1959 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report on the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, we unanimously agree with and support these reports.

Premier Zhou's report pointed out that an unprecedented leap forward in the national economy occurred in China's history in 1958. The increase in the output of many industrial and agricultural products in one year, 1958, exceeded the increase in five years during the First Five-Year Plan, and people's communes integrating industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and combining government and commune, emerged in rural areas across the country. Premier Zhou's report also pointed out that with the advent of the socialist economic high tide, a socialist cultural high tide began to rise in our country. In 1958, China made significant progress in education, culture, health, science and technology. We are engaged in medical science work, and from the work of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, we deeply realize that 1958 was also a year of great leap forward in medical science. After the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences merged with the former Peking Union Medical College in October 1957, it developed rapidly in 1958 against the backdrop of the nationwide great leap forward and on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement. It grew from the original two research institutes, one hospital, and ten departments to ten research institutes, five hospitals, and three departments, engaged in research in basic medicine, clinical medicine, preventive medicine, and pharmacy, gradually forming a relatively complete medical research center.

	Conducting In-Depth Research at Extensive Sites Such as Factories, Mines, and Rural Areas, Serving Production and Construction with Science and Technology

One of the important signs of the leap forward in medical scientific research in 1958 was the implementation of the policy of serving production and construction with science and technology. Research in basic, clinical, preventive, and pharmaceutical departments moved from the narrow confines of laboratories, wards, and certain small-scale pilot sites to large-scale sites, penetrating factories, mines, construction sites, forest areas, rural people's communes, and urban street families, facing the vast working class and peasantry, closely integrating theory with practice, and playing an important role in guiding practical prevention and control work.

In the prevention and control of the five major parasitic diseases, the Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences organized seven working groups to conduct research on key issues in Anhui and Hainan Island. In order to ensure the health of laborers in newly developed areas, new industrial bases, and national defense borders, the Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, in collaboration with other institutions, sent survey teams to eleven provinces, one city, and three autonomous regions to investigate the prevalence of diseases and their epidemic factors, in order to formulate comprehensive prevention and control plans. The rural people's commune health work team organized by relevant units of the entire academy took two people's communes in Anguo County, Hebei Province, as its base to carry out research work on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major infectious diseases, in order to summarize a relatively complete health construction plan for rural people's communes. In order to protect the health of workers in factories and mines, the Institute of Labor Hygiene, Labor Protection, and Occupational Diseases sent a work team to Dajishan in Jiangxi to conduct research on the prevention and control of silicosis. Researchers in nutritional surveys and food hygiene have set foot in all provinces of the country except Tibet and Qinghai. Researchers in the prevention and control of venereal diseases and leprosy are distributed in seven provinces and two autonomous regions. Research on tumors and hypertension is also combined with resident census work.

Because the research work penetrates the front lines, and theory is closely integrated with practice, relatively significant research achievements can be obtained in a relatively short period of time. For example, in terms of eliminating the four pests, a water surface fumigant was created so that the smoke can contact the water surface to kill mosquito larvae; eight rodenticides and six flea killers were found from a large number of wild plants and traditional Chinese medicines. In the prevention and control of the five major parasitic diseases, on the basis of studying various major links, a snail eradication plan for reed marshes, which is of great significance for eliminating schistosomiasis, as well as plans for eliminating malaria, filariasis, kala-azar, and hookworm disease, were formulated. In terms of occupational disease prevention and control, through on-site work, dust in mining areas has been reduced to below the allowable concentration. In the field of hypertension, prevention and control research has been carried out in certain areas, and combined with the prevention and control work in these areas, some preliminary data has been obtained on the etiology and pathogenesis of hypertension through examinations of higher nervous activity, autonomic nerve function, and body fluids, providing clues for further exploration of the etiology and pathogenesis. In the area of malignant tumors, through the general survey of a large number of residents, not only the effect of early detection of patients and early treatment was achieved, but also some factors related to the incidence of the disease were discovered. These studies not only solved practical problems, but also improved scientific theory.

	Strengthening Scientific Theoretical Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine on the Basis of Summarizing Treatment Effects

Another sign of the leap forward in medical scientific research in 1958 is the research and promotion of traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, qigong, massage, and other treatments, has been widely used in medical institutions throughout the country. Taking Peking Union Medical College Hospital as an example, traditional Chinese medicine is used to treat more than 50 kinds of diseases, and acupuncture is used to treat more than 20 kinds. Acupuncture treatment for asthma, angina pectoris, tachycardia, pulseless disease, sequelae of infantile paralysis, and ferrous sulfate treatment for trachoma have all shown good results. On the basis of combining learning and application, integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatments have been gradually developed, such as the treatment of cerebral thrombosis, neurasthenia, acute mastitis, and autumn diarrhea in children, which have better effects than using traditional Chinese medicine alone or Western medicine alone. For traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture treatment for hypertension, appendicitis, acupuncture treatment for sequelae of infantile paralysis, qigong treatment for peptic ulcer, uterine pills for cervical erosion and pelvic organ prolapse, and other treatments, on the basis of summarizing the curative effects, further research on the mechanism of action has begun, which is the research using modern scientific methods to explain the theory of traditional Chinese medicine.

	Carrying out Mass Scientific Research

Breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, and launching vigorous mass movements, replacing the past situation of a small number of experts doing research work in a cold and quiet manner with a vigorous mass-based research approach, is another important sign of the leap forward in medical scientific research in 1958. The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences launched three upsurges of presenting gifts to the Party on "July 1st," "November," and New Year's Day in 1959, achieving a total of 4,020 items in scientific research, medical care, instrument manufacturing, technological innovation, and compiling teaching materials, papers, and works, of which 514 items belonged to scientific research achievements. Due to the mobilization of the masses, the Youth Anti-Cancer Commando Team statistically analyzed 27,000 tumor cases and completed clinical pathological morphological studies of 1,895 cases of cervical cancer within four weeks, proposing a new classification method. Due to breaking superstitions, inspired by the glorious deeds of Shanghai Second Medical College Affiliated Guangci Hospital in rescuing the life of worker Qiu Cai Kang, Peking Union Medical College Hospital rescued 165 patients who were previously considered difficult to save, and 94 of these 165 patients were fully recovered. Extracting antihypertensive drugs from Rauwolfia, synthesizing cortisone from sisal extracts, producing ergot alkaloids by artificial fermentation, cultivating aureomycin using local methods, manufacturing erythromycin and gibberellin using new methods, and manufacturing dextran, which can replace plasma, using local methods, were all research topics that were previously considered difficult to complete, but they were all completed in a short period of time.

Why did medical scientific research make such a big leap forward in 1958? The most important reason is the establishment of the Party's absolute leadership over scientific undertakings. Before and in the early stages of the rectification movement, not only did right-wing elements say with ulterior motives: "The Party cannot lead science," "Laymen cannot lead experts," but many scientists who were willing to take the socialist road did not completely agree with the Party's views on certain specific issues related to scientific research. When the Party proposed that scientific research must serve politics and production and construction, they said that science is above politics and should be for science's sake. When the Party proposed that scientific research must be carried out in a planned manner, they said that planning would bind the development of science. When the Party proposed that research work must follow the mass line, they said that research work can only be done by experienced scientists, and even more cannot be carried out in the manner of launching movements. When the Party issued the call to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, they said that scientific research work has its unchangeable laws. When the Party called on Western medicine to learn from traditional Chinese medicine and inherit and carry forward the medicine of the motherland, they said that traditional Chinese medicine is unscientific. Only after the great victory of the rectification and anti-rightist movement, and the establishment of the Party's absolute leadership over scientific research work, can the Party's policies be thoroughly implemented and scientific undertakings flourish.

The achievements of medical scientific research in the past year are huge, but compared with the needs of the people's health undertakings and the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, our work is far from enough. We must make greater efforts in 1959, under the leadership of the Party, continue to implement the mass line, give full play to the positive factors in all aspects, go all out, and strive to complete the scientific and technological tasks that directly serve production and construction, while developing cutting-edge science and technology and paying attention to the research of basic theories, so as to ensure industrial and agricultural production and improve the level of medical science. China's medical scientific research team is growing stronger day by day. By the end of 1958, there were 108 medical scientific research institutions in the country, 2.85 times the 38 in 1957. As far as we know, nine provinces including Hubei, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Jilin, Shanxi, Shandong, and Hebei have established local academies of medical sciences. National medical colleges and various medical and preventive institutions are also vigorously carrying out scientific research work. Achieving a greater leap forward in 1959 is conditional. Let us unite and strengthen cooperation to achieve greater achievements in medical science and greet our great 10th National Day with a new health outlook!

Finally, we medical workers feel extremely angry about the armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper reactionary group, the kidnapping of the Dalai Lama, and the conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists to split Tibet from China. We fully support the State Council's order of March 28 on suppressing the Tibetan rebellion and disbanding the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion. Now, the Tibetan rebellion has been basically quelled, and scattered bandits will be eliminated soon. A new era of national regional autonomy in Tibet has arrived, and we medical workers guarantee to contribute our strength to the health and happiness of the Tibetan compatriots.
