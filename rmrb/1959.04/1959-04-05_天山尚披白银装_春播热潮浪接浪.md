Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, April 4th: Although the Tianshan Mountains are still covered in silver, the Turpan Basin is already a charming scene of spring. After finishing the spring wheat sowing, the people's communes in the basin are now taking advantage of the good spring weather to rush to plant cotton. For more than a month, the spring sowing upsurge in the entire basin has been rising wave after wave. From the fields to the vineyards, from the main roads to the karez construction sites outside the villages, everywhere you can see Uyghur men and women commune members working hard. In the fields, there is a hubbub of voices and dust flying, tall horses dragging deep plows and sowing machines shuttle back and forth, and fertilizer delivery teams are constantly on the move all day long.
    Turpan County used to mainly produce cotton, grapes, melons, and fruits. This year, in addition to striving for a greater leap forward in the production of various economic crops, the county is also determined to expand the planting area of food crops and strive for food self-sufficiency. In order to realize this magnificent leap forward plan, the county's farmers have accumulated more than 10 billion jin of fertilizer since last winter, dredged the karez (underground canals) that irrigate the county's farmland, and have reclaimed more than 25,000 mu of wasteland. In late February, as soon as the climate warmed up slightly, the people's communes organized commune members to engage in the battle of sowing spring wheat. Thanks to the hard work of the commune members, although the county's spring wheat planting area has been expanded by more than 20,000 mu this year, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased by more than two times, it was still completed on March 23, ten days earlier than in previous years.

### 天山尚披白银装  春播热潮浪接浪

    天山尚披白银装  春播热潮浪接浪
    新疆
    据新华社乌鲁木齐4日电　天山还是披着银装，吐鲁番盆地却已是一片迷人的春色。盆地上各个人民公社在春小麦播种结束之后，目前又趁着大好春光抢种棉花。一个多月来，整个盆地春播热潮一浪推一浪。从田野到葡萄园，从条条大道到村外坎儿井工地，只见处处是维吾尔族男女社员在紧张地劳动。田野里，人声鼎沸，尘土飞扬，高头大马拖着深耕犁、播种机往来如梭，送肥队伍整天络绎不绝。
    吐鲁番县过去以出产棉花、葡萄、瓜果为主。今年全县除了争取各种经济作物的生产更大跃进以外，还决心扩大粮食作物种植面积，力争粮食自给。全县农民为了实现这个雄伟的跃进计划，从去冬以来已经积肥一百多亿斤，掏捞了灌溉全县农田的坎儿井（暗渠），并已开荒两万五千多亩。2月下旬，气候稍一转暖，各人民公社就组织社员投入了播种春小麦的战斗。由于公社社员们的苦干猛干，今年全县春麦播种面积虽然扩大了两万多亩，施肥量增加了两倍多，仍然比往年提前十天在3月23日就播种完毕。
