The most popular argument used by bourgeois economists and sociologists to attack Marx's theory is to insist that Marx reduced the entire bourgeois society to only two antagonistic classes, and that Marx predicted the middle strata would inevitably and rapidly be eliminated.

Marxist theory never denies the existence of intermediate strata. However, it sees the existence of intermediate strata as a temporary and transitional state, and points out that a dual process constantly occurs within these strata: on the one hand, the lower bourgeoisie is pushed into the ranks of the proletariat; on the other hand, a very small number of the upper proletariat is absorbed into the ranks of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, Marxism also denies that such "social changes" can in any way alter the essence and class structure of the capitalist system. Marx and Engels in "The Communist Manifesto" have several paragraphs describing the proletarianization process that inevitably leads to the decline of the "middle strata," but the authors of "The Communist Manifesto" never doubted the tenacious vitality of the intermediate strata. Marx and Engels wrote: "In countries where modern civilization has developed, a new petty bourgeoisie has been formed—and is constantly being reformed as a supplementary part of bourgeois society—fluctuating between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." This situation, on the one hand, increases the burden on the working class, and on the other hand, strengthens the power of the upper class and their living conditions.

First, the middle strata include small farmers, handicraftsmen, and small merchants. The existence of this type of resident is due to the retention of pre-capitalist modes of production and corresponding forms of exchange in bourgeois society. That is to say, this type of people can be said to be the "old" middle social strata, most of whom were formed in feudal society and have been preserved to this day.

In addition to these strata, there is another intermediate stratum that was formed later; its emergence and development are caused by the development of modern capitalist productive forces and the strengthening of parasitic tendencies.

Modern capitalism constantly generates new middle strata: employees of state organs, state-owned and private enterprises, engineering and technical personnel, intellectual workers, and so on. However, the increase in the number of middle strata, unlike what bourgeois sociologists try to prove, cannot eliminate or engulf the basic classes of bourgeois society—the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. This process only proves that as capital constantly includes a vast number of working residents into its scope of exploitation, it deepens the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and millions of working people. The position of the intermediate strata is extremely unstable, and they are constantly differentiating at all times. A large number of them, such as junior staff and junior engineering and technical personnel, have no essential difference from the working class in terms of their living and working conditions.

The history of the formation of the middle social strata, their economic foundation, and their function in the social organism make the components of these strata extremely complex. Their only common feature is that they must stand between the two poles, that is, the two basic social classes—the bourgeoisie and the proletariat—in developed capitalist societies, that is, in the middle state of these two basic classes. Due to the complex components of these strata, any attempt to give these strata an accurate general definition or to describe these strata as an independent social class is doomed to failure. The argument about the "middle class" is scientifically wrong and politically dangerous. It is scientifically wrong because these strata, whether as a whole or in part, do not conform to the Marxist, that is, the truly scientific class definition.

Among the various members of the middle strata, neither the major common interests necessary for the formation of class consciousness have been formed, nor is there a basis for certain class political organizations that should play an independent historical role.

This position of the middle strata makes it impossible for them to implement policies that are truly their own. The reason is very simple: in a society basically composed of two opposing classes, all other strata must come into contact with these two basic forces, and their actions inevitably either strengthen one of these forces or strengthen the other. It is impossible for a "middle route" to exist for a long time in modern capitalist society.

The argument of the "middle class" is politically dangerous because it obscures the principle of the proletariat forming an alliance with the non-proletarian working masses. Its danger also lies in the fact that it conceals the differentiation that occurs among the various parts of the middle strata. This differentiation will inevitably bring a large part of the middle strata closer to the proletariat in objective terms.

The analysis of the social and political characteristics of various middle strata proves that the basic interests of the majority of them are consistent with the interests of the working class. However, this analysis also proves that, due to the myriad links between these strata and the ruling class, their understanding of their own interests is often vague. These social strata remain attached to the capitalist social way in terms of their position, responsibilities, sources of income, or the way these incomes are obtained. Finally, the objective basis for opposing the big bourgeoisie in these different strata also varies.

Today, it is clearer than ever that it is wrong and dangerous to regard the middle strata as a monolithic reactionary gang that is hostile to the proletariat. But it is equally clear that, for various reasons, these strata may play the role of an "auxiliary stratum" of the bourgeoisie.

Experience shows that in times of acute class struggle or economic hardship, the middle strata, or at least the majority of them, after repeated wandering and wavering, will naturally turn to the stronger side. It can be seen that the unity of the working class is the most important condition for these strata, or at least the majority of these strata, to break with the bourgeoisie and turn from the reserve army of the bourgeoisie into the reserve army of the proletariat.

If the working class cannot guarantee to obtain the support of a part of these strata and guarantee that the other part of them maintains benevolent neutrality, it is impossible to expect to seize power and maintain power. Lenin once said to the Russian Social Democrats that they should go to all classes of residents as theorists, propagandists, and agitators. This teaching still retains its full value today.

### 中等阶层不可能成为独立的阶级

    中等阶层不可能成为独立的阶级
    资产阶级的经济学家和社会学家在对马克思的学说进行攻击时的一个最流行的说法，就是硬说马克思把整个资产阶级社会只归结为两个敌对阶级，硬说马克思预言中等阶层必然要迅速地归于消灭。
    马克思主义理论绝不否认中间阶层的存在。但是它把中间阶层的存在看做一种暂时的、过渡的状态，并指出在这些阶层内部经常地发生着两重性的过程：一方面，资产阶级下层被推向无产阶级队伍；另一方面，极少数的无产阶级上层被吸向资产阶级队伍。同时马克思主义也否认，这样的“社会变动”能够在任何程度上改变资本主义制度的本质和阶级结构。马克思和恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中有几段话描述了必然促使“中等阶层”日趋衰落的无产化过程，但是，“共产党宣言”的作者们对于中间阶层的顽强生命力从来没有发生过怀疑。马克思和恩格斯写道：“在近世文明已经发展的国家里，已经形成了——并且作为资产阶级社会的补充部分而经常重新形成着——新的小资产阶级，它动摇于无产阶级和资产阶级之间”。这种情况一方面加重着工人阶级的负担，另方面则加强上层阶级的力量和它们的生活地位。
    首先，中等阶层中包括小农、手工业者和小商人。这一类居民的存在，是由于在资产阶级社会中保留着资本主义前的生产方式以及相应的交换形式的残余。就是说，这一类人可以说是“旧的”中等社会阶层，它们大都是在封建社会中形成的，并且保存到现在。
    除了这些阶层外，还存在另一种后来才形成的中间阶层；它们的产生和发展，是由现代资本主义的生产力发展和寄生倾向加强所造成的。
    现代资本主义不断产生着新的中等阶层：国家机关、国营和私营企业的职员、工程技术人员、智力劳动者等等。可是中等阶层人数的增加，并不像资产阶级社会学家企图证明的那样，能够消灭或吞噬资产阶级社会的基本阶级——无产阶级和资产阶级。这一过程仅仅证明，由于资本不断把广大劳动居民包括到自己的剥削范围里来，所以便加深着资产阶级与千百万劳动人民之间的矛盾。中间阶层的地位极不稳定，它们时时刻刻地在分化。它们中间很大一部分人，例如小职员、下级工程技术人员，就他们的生活和劳动条件来说，是和工人阶级没有任何本质差别的。
    中等社会阶层形成的历史、它们的经济基础、以及它们在社会机体当中的职能，使得这些阶层的成份极其复杂。它们唯一的共同特征就是，它们在发达的资本主义社会一定都是站在两极即两个基本社会阶级——资产阶级与无产阶级之间，也就是说，处在这两个基本阶级的中间状态。由于这些阶层成分复杂，所以给这些阶层下一个准确的总定义或把这些阶层说成一个独立的社会阶级的任何企图都注定是要失败的。关于“中等阶级”的论点，在科学上是错误的，而在政治上是危险的。所以说它在科学上是错误的，是因为这些阶层不管在整体或是在局部上都不符合马克思主义的即真正科学的阶级定义。
    在中等阶层的各个成员之间，既没有形成阶级意识所必需的重大的共同利益，也没有应当起独立历史作用的、一定的阶级政治组织的基础。
    中等阶层的这种地位，使他们不可能实行真正是他们自己的政策，道理很简单，在基本上是由两个对抗阶级组成的社会里，一切其他阶层都要同这两种基本力量发生接触，他们的行动不可避免地不是加强这一种力量，就是加强那一种力量。“中间路线”要在现代资本主义社会长期存在是不可能的。
    “中等阶级”的论点在政治上所以是危险的，是因为它会模糊无产阶级同非无产阶级劳动群众阶层结成联盟的原则。它的危险还在于它掩盖了中等阶层各部分人中间所发生的分化。这种分化在客观上必然使中等阶层的很大一部分人接近于无产阶级。
    对各种中等阶层的社会情况和政治情况的特点的分析证明，他们当中大多数人的基本利益与工人阶级的利益是一致的。但是，这种分析也证明，由于这些阶层同统治阶级具有千丝万缕的联系，他们对于本身利益的认识，往往是模糊不清的。这些社会阶层在自己的地位、责任、收入来源或这些收入的取得方式上，仍然依恋于资本主义的社会方式。最后，在这些不同的阶层中反对大资产阶级的客观基础也各有区别。
    今天比以往任何时候都明显，把中等阶层看成清一色的敌视无产阶级的反动的一帮，那是错误的和危险的。但是同样明显的是，由于各方面的原因，这些阶层可能起资产阶级的“辅助阶层”的作用。
    经验证明，在尖锐的阶级斗争或经济困难时期，中等阶层，或者至少是他们中间的多数人，经过一次又一次的徘徊和动摇，会自然而然地投靠到力量较强的一方。由此可见，工人阶级的统一是使这些阶层，或者至少是使这些阶层的大多数人同资产阶级决裂、由资产阶级后备军变成无产阶级后备军的最首要的条件。
    工人阶级如果不能保证取得这些阶层中一部分人的支持和保证他们另一部分人保持善意的中立，要指望夺取政权和保持政权是不可能的。列宁当年曾经对俄国社会民主党人说过，应当既以理论家的身分，又以宣传员的身分，又以鼓动员的身分到居民的一切阶级中去，这一教诲直到现在保持着它的全部价值。
