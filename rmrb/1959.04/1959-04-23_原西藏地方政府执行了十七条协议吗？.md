    Did the Former Tibetan Local Government Implement the Seventeen-Article Agreement?
    Ji Hong
    In the so-called "Declaration of the Dalai Lama" distributed through Indian foreign officials in Tezpur on April 18, there is a passage that says the Tibetan local government did its utmost to abide by the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, but the Chinese authorities have been constantly interfering. This passage portrays the Tibetan rebel group as innocent lambs faithfully adhering to the agreement, and the Central People's Government as an unreasonable government. However, this statement does not provide any facts to prove that the original Tibetan local government faithfully implemented the agreement, while the central government violated the agreement. Now, let's take a look at the actual situation of the original Tibetan local government and the central government's implementation of the agreement.
    First, let's look at what the Seventeen-Article Agreement includes:
    I. The Tibetan people shall unite and drive out imperialist aggressive forces from Tibet; the Tibetan people shall return to the motherland, the People's Republic of China.
    II. The Tibetan local government shall actively assist the People's Liberation Army in entering Tibet and consolidating national defense.
    III. In accordance with the policy on nationalities of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Tibetan people have the right to exercise regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government.
    IV. The central authorities will not alter the established political system in Tibet. The established status, functions and powers of the Dalai Lama will be maintained. Officials of various ranks shall continue to hold office as usual.
    V. The established status, functions and powers of the Panchen Erdeni shall be maintained.
    VI. The established status, functions and powers of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni refer to the status, functions and powers of the 13th Dalai Lama and the 9th Panchen Erdeni when they were friendly to each other.
    VII. The Policy of freedom in religious belief as prescribed in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will be carried out, the religious beliefs, customs and habits of the Tibetan people will be respected, and the Lama monasteries will be protected. The central authorities will not effect any change in the income of the monasteries.
    VIII. The Tibetan troops will be reorganized step by step into the People's Liberation Army and become a part of the defense forces of the People's Republic of China.
    IX. The spoken and written language and school education of the Tibetan nationality will be developed step by step in accordance with the actual conditions in Tibet.
    X. Tibetan agriculture, animal husbandry, industry and commerce will be developed step by step in accordance with the actual conditions in Tibet, and the people’s livelihood will be improved.
    XI. In regard to various reforms in Tibet, the central authorities will not use compulsion. The Tibetan local government should carry out reforms of its own accord, and when the people raise demands for reform, the matter must be settled by means of consultation with the leading personnel of Tibet.
    XII. Former pro-imperialist and pro-Kuomintang officials may, provided they resolutely sever relations with imperialism and the Kuomintang and do not engage in sabotage or resistance, continue to hold office as usual, irrespective of their past misdeeds.
    XIII. The People’s Liberation Army entering Tibet shall abide by all the above-mentioned policies and shall also be fair in all buying and selling and shall not arbitrarily take a single needle or thread from the people.
    XIV. The Central People’s Government shall have the centralized handling of all external affairs of the Tibet area; and there will be peaceful co-existence with neighboring countries and establishment and development of fair trading relations with them on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for territory and sovereignty.
    XV. In order to ensure the implementation of this agreement, the Central People’s Government shall set up a military and administrative committee and a military area headquarters in Tibet; and apart from the personnel sent there by the Central People’s Government it shall absorb as many local Tibetan personnel as possible to take part in the work.
    Local Tibetan personnel taking part in the military and administrative committee may include patriotic elements from the Tibetan local government, various districts and various principal monasteries; the namelist shall be drawn up after consultation by the representatives designated by the Central People’s Government with the various quarters concerned, and shall be submitted to the Central People’s Government for appointment.
    XVI. Funds needed by the military and administrative committee, the military area headquarters and the People’s Liberation Army entering Tibet shall be provided by the Central People’s Government. The Tibetan local government should assist the People’s Liberation Army in the purchase and transport of food, fodder and other daily necessities.
    XVII. This agreement shall come into force immediately after signatures and seals are affixed to it.
    According to Articles I, III, and XII of the agreement, the Tibetan local government should unite the Tibetan people, drive out imperialist forces from Tibet, and implement national regional autonomy; but in reality, they were actively engaging in activities to adapt to the demands of imperialism and foreign reactionaries, engaging in so-called "independence" to split the motherland. Under their obstruction, the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region made almost no progress. The rebellion, which the Tibetan people unanimously opposed, was launched under their collusion with imperialism and foreign reactionaries.
    According to Articles II and VIII of the agreement, the Tibetan local government should actively assist the People's Liberation Army in entering Tibet to consolidate national defense; the original Tibetan army should be gradually reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, becoming a part of the defense forces of the People's Republic of China. How did the original Tibetan local government implement these provisions? Until now, they have not reorganized any part of the original Tibetan army into the People's Liberation Army; on the contrary, they have been painstakingly trying to eliminate the People's Liberation Army. The central government was magnanimous and patient, but they eventually launched a full-scale offensive against the People's Liberation Army, attempting to turn Tibet into a foreign colony and protectorate.
    According to Article XI, the Tibetan local government should carry out reforms on its own accord. But, for a full eight years, what reforms have they made? The barbaric and cruel feudal serf system has not changed one bit, and the people still suffer under their bloody rule. In the manors of the original Tibetan local government, nobles, and monasteries, serf owners could openly inflict various cruel punishments on serfs, such as gouging out eyes, chopping off hands, pulling tendons, and flaying skin, even roasting them alive or crushing them to death with stones. The vast majority of the serfs' labor成果 was plundered by the serf owners, and the serfs had no civil rights, not to mention anything else.
    These iron facts everywhere prove that the original Tibetan local government did not implement the Seventeen-Article Agreement. The central government has always strictly adhered to the Seventeen-Article Agreement.
    According to the provisions of Articles IV, V, and VI of the agreement, the central government has not changed the current political system in Tibet. Until now, the political system in Tibet is exactly the same as before the peaceful liberation. The Dalai Lama's inherent status and powers were not only not changed, but he was also elected as Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, becoming a national leader, and was also appointed as the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. After liberation, officials of all levels, both monks and laymen, in the original Tibetan local government continued to hold their posts as usual; no internal affairs in Tibet were handled without going through the original Tibetan local government. Even with regard to the rebel activities that began between May and June of last year, the central government, in the spirit of national unity, repeatedly instructed the original Tibetan local government to be responsible for handling them, instead of suppressing the rebellion itself.
    The central government has consistently adhered to the policy of freedom of religious belief, not only in other parts of the country but also in Tibet. According to the provisions of Article VII of the agreement, all People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet and central government personnel sent to Tibet strictly respected the religious beliefs, customs, and habits of the Tibetan people. In the past few years, all local Tibetan Lama monasteries, regardless of their sect, have been protected and respected. The central government did not make any changes to their income, and their religious activities continued as before. During major Lamaist festivals, representatives of the central government stationed in Tibet also distributed a lot of alms to the monks and nuns of the three major monasteries and other monasteries. When Lama monasteries needed to purchase goods from afar, the central government also provided assistance in transportation. The central government's policy of respecting the religious beliefs of the Tibetan people and protecting Lama monasteries has been enthusiastically supported by monks and laypeople of all strata in Tibet.
    The economic and cultural construction carried out by the central government in Tibet, despite being obstructed by the upper reactionary group in many ways, has still achieved great results; the Kangzang, Qingzang, Xinzang (Yecheng to Gadak), and Laya (Lhasa to Yadong) highways, with a total length of more than 7,000 kilometers, have been built; the Lhasa River Bridge and the Nianchu River Bridge have been built; the Lhasa hydroelectric power station, small iron factory, serum factory, leather factory, borax factory, automobile repair factory, and the Rikaze thermal power plant and other small and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises have been built; many hospitals have been established, providing free medical treatment for the Tibetan people; various schools have been established to eliminate illiteracy and improve the cultural level of the Tibetan people; large amounts of interest-free agricultural and animal husbandry loans have been issued, and many agricultural tools have been provided free of charge, and large amounts of funds have been used to provide relief to flood victims. All of these prove that the central government faithfully implemented Articles IX and X of the agreement (gradually developing Tibet's economy and culture and improving people's lives in accordance with Tibet's actual conditions) and has done a lot of work for the Tibetan people.
     According to Article XI, Tibet must implement social reforms. This is the urgent demand of the Tibetan people; without reform, Tibet cannot embark on the road to prosperity and progress. However, taking into account the situation in Tibet, the agreement also stipulates that the central authorities will not use compulsion in regard to various reform undertakings in Tibet, but will leave it to the original Tibetan local government to carry out on its own accord. The upper-level reactionaries in Tibet resolutely opposed social reform, and the central government also adopted a patient waiting attitude towards them. In order to give the original Tibetan local government and upper-level figures sufficient time to consider, at the end of 1956, the central government announced to the original Tibetan local government that democratic reforms could not be carried out in Tibet for six years, that is, before 1962. It can truly be said that the central government has done its best to take care of national unity.
    According to the provisions of Article XIII, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet strictly implemented the various policies in the agreement, engaged in fair buying and selling, and did not arbitrarily take a single needle or thread from the people, which is well-known to the Tibetan people and does not need to be described in detail.
    Based on the above, it can be seen that the so-called "Declaration of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian foreign officials is a pure lie.
    Now, the original Tibetan local government has openly rebelled, completely tearing up the Seventeen-Article Agreement. The traitors thought they could split the motherland and make Tibet regress, but, contrary to their wishes, this has instead promoted the unification and consolidation of the motherland and promoted the new birth of Tibet, opening up a new historical period for Tibet.

    原西藏地方政府执行了十七条协议吗？
    吉红
    4月18日在提斯浦尔经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中有一段说，西藏地方政府曾经尽最大的力量来遵守和平解放西藏办法十七条协议，但是中国当局却一直进行干涉。这段话把西藏叛乱集团描写成忠实于协议的“无罪的羔羊”，把中央人民政府描写成蛮不讲理的政府。但是，这个声明没有提出任何事实来证明原西藏地方政府忠实执行了协议，而中央倒违反了协议。现在，我们不妨来看一看原西藏地方政府和中央执行协议的实际情形。
    先看一下十七条协议包括一些什么内容：
    一、西藏人民团结起来，驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出西藏，西藏人民回到中华人民共和国祖国大家庭中来。
    二、西藏地方政府积极协助人民解放军进入西藏，巩固国防。
    三、根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的民族政策，在中央人民政府统一领导之下，西藏人民有实行民族区域自治的权利。
    四、对于西藏的现行政治制度，中央不予变更。达赖喇嘛的固有地位及职权，中央亦不予变更。各级官员照常供职。
    五、班禅额尔德尼的固有地位及职权，应予维持。
    六、达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的固有地位及职权，系指十三世达赖喇嘛与九世班禅额尔德尼彼此和好相处时的地位及职权。
    七、实行中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领规定的宗教信仰自由的政策，尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，保护喇嘛寺庙。寺庙的收入，中央不予变更。
    八、西藏军队逐步改编为人民解放军，成为中华人民共和国国防武装的一部分。
    九、依据西藏的实际情况，逐步发展西藏民族的语言、文字和学校教育。
    十、依据西藏的实际情况，逐步发展西藏的农牧工商业，改善人民生活。
    十一、有关西藏的各项改革事宜，中央不加强迫。西藏地方政府应自动进行改革，人民提出改革要求时，得采取与西藏领导人员协商的方法解决之。
    十二、过去亲帝国主义和亲国民党的官员，只要坚决脱离与帝国主义和国民党的关系，不进行破坏和反抗，仍可继续供职，不究既往。
    十三、进入西藏的人民解放军遵守上列各项政策，同时买卖公平，不妄取人民一针一线。
    十四、中央人民政府统一处理西藏地区的一切涉外事宜，并在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的基础上，与邻邦和平相处，建立和发展公平的通商贸易关系。
    十五、为保证本协议之执行，中央人民政府在西藏设立军政委员会和军区司令部，除中央人民政府派去的人员外，尽量吸收西藏地方人员参加工作。
    参加军政委员会的西藏地方人员，得包括西藏地方政府及各地区、各主要寺庙的爱国分子，由中央人民政府指定的代表与有关各方面协商提出名单，报请中央人民政府任命。
    十六、军政委员会、军区司令部及入藏人民解放军所需经费，由中央人民政府供给。西藏地方政府应协助人民解放军购买和运输粮秣及其他日用品。
    十七、本协议于签字盖章后立即生效。
    根据协议第一条、第三条和第十二条，西藏地方政府应当团结西藏人民，驱逐帝国主义势力出西藏，实行民族区域自治；但他们实际上却是在适应帝国主义和外国反动派的要求，积极活动，搞分裂祖国的所谓“独立”。在他们的阻挠下，西藏自治区筹委会的工作几乎没有什么进展。而西藏人民所一致反对的叛乱却在他们同帝国主义和外国反动派的勾结下发动起来了。
    根据协议第二条和第八条，西藏地方政府应当积极地协助人民解放军进入西藏，巩固国防；原来的西藏军队应当逐步地改编为人民解放军，成为中华人民共和国国防武装的一部分。原西藏地方政府是怎样执行这些规定的呢？一直到现在，他们没有把任何一部分原西藏军队改编成人民解放军；相反的，他们一直在处心积虑想消灭人民解放军。中央宽大为怀，耐心等待，而他们最后却对人民解放军发动了全面的进攻，企图把西藏变成外国的殖民地和保护国。
    根据第十一条，西藏地方政府应当自动进行改革。但是，整整八年了，他们改革了一些什么呢？野蛮残暴的封建农奴制度一丝一毫没有改变，人民仍然忍受着他们的血腥统治。原西藏地方政府的、贵族的和寺庙的庄园中，农奴主可以公然对农奴施用挖眼、剁手、抽筋、剥皮等各种酷刑，直至活活烤死或是用石头砸死。农奴劳动成果的绝大部分被农奴主掠去，农奴没有公民权，这些就更不用说了。
    这些铁的事实处处证明原西藏地方政府并没有执行十七条协议。而中央却一直是严格地遵守了十七条协议的。
    根据协议第四、五、六条的规定，西藏现行的政治制度中央没有去改变。直到现在，西藏的政治制度还与和平解放以前一模一样。达赖喇嘛的固有地位和职权不仅未予改变，还选为全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长，成为国家的领导人员，而且又委任为西藏自治区筹委会的主任委员。解放后原西藏地方政府的各级僧俗官员，照常供职；西藏的内部事务，没有一件不经由原西藏地方政府来进行。甚至对于从去年5、6月间开始的叛乱活动，中央也本着民族团结的精神，一再责成原西藏地方政府负责处理，而没有自己动手平息叛乱。
    中央一贯坚持宗教信仰自由的政策，不但在全国其他地区如此，在西藏也是如此。根据协议第七条的规定，所有的驻藏人民解放军和中央派到西藏去的工作人员，都严格地尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯。过去几年中，所有西藏地方的喇嘛寺院，不论是什么教派的，都受到保护和尊重。他们的收入，中央没有作任何变更，他们的宗教活动照旧进行。在喇嘛教的重大节日里，中央驻西藏的代表还给三大寺及其他寺院僧众发放过不少布施。喇嘛寺庙需要从远处购买物品，中央还在运输方面加以帮助。中央尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰和保护喇嘛寺庙的政策，受到了西藏各阶层僧俗人员的热烈拥护。
    中央在西藏进行的经济文化建设，尽管受到上层反动集团的多方阻挠，仍然取得了很大的成绩；建筑了全长七千公里以上的康藏、青藏、新藏（叶城到噶大克）、拉亚（拉萨到亚东）等公路；修建了拉萨河大桥和年楚河大桥；修建了拉萨的水力发电站、小型铁工厂、血清厂、皮革厂、硼砂厂、汽车修配厂和日喀则的火力发电厂等中小型的工矿企业；办了许多医院，免费为西藏人民诊治疾病；办了各种学校，为西藏人民扫除文盲，提高文化水平；发放了大量的农牧业无息贷款，免费供给了许多农具，还曾经以大量的款项救济遭受了水灾的难民。所有这些，证明中央忠实执行了协议的第九、十条（根据西藏的实际情况，逐步发展西藏的经济文化改善人民生活），为西藏人民作了不少的工作。
     根据协议第十一条，西藏必须实行社会改革。这是西藏人民的迫切要求，不改革就不能使西藏走上繁荣进步的道路。但是照顾到西藏的情况，在协议中又规定有关西藏各项改革事业，中央不加强迫，而由原西藏地方政府自动进行。西藏的上层反动分子坚决反对社会改革，中央对他们也采取了耐心等待的态度。为了给原西藏地方政府和上层人士以充分考虑的时间，在1956年底，中央曾向原西藏地方政府宣布，在六年内，即在1962年以前，在西藏可以不进行民主改革。中央为了照顾民族的团结，的确可以说是仁至义尽了。
    根据第十三条的规定，人民解放军驻藏部队极其严格地执行了协议上的各项政策，公平买卖，不妄取人民一针一线，这是西藏人民有口皆碑的，用不着细说。
    根据以上所述，可见由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”是纯粹的谎言。
    现在，原西藏地方政府公然叛乱，完全撕毁了十七条协议。叛国分子以为可以分裂祖国和使西藏倒退，但是，和他们的愿望相反，这反而促成了祖国的统一和巩固，促成了西藏的新生，使西藏开辟一个新的历史时期。
