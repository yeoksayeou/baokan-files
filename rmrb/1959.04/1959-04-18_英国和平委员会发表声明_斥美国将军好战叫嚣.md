Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th - The British Peace Committee today issued a statement calling on the British government and leaders of all political parties to oppose the nuclear war threats recently issued by American military leaders and other leading figures on the German question over the past few weeks.

The statement said: "The issuance of (American) such threats is accompanied by the announcement that American rocket bases in our country (Britain) are ready for use at any time."

The statement continued: "We remind the British people that this threatens the survival of our country. Khrushchev recently emphasized when he met with peace movement leaders in Moscow that he had reminded Macmillan that if these bases were to be used to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union would have no choice but to destroy these bases. It is said that Macmillan said during his visit to the United States that if there was a danger of war, Britain would evacuate children to remote areas of the Commonwealth.

"These facts will surely convince people of all walks of life in our country that our country has no choice but to try to hold negotiations to peacefully resolve the issues that divide countries."

The statement called on the government not only to oppose the American threat, but also "to warn the United States: unless it withdraws this threat, it will take measures to prevent it from using these bases."

　　英国和平委员会发表声明
　　斥美国将军好战叫嚣
    新华社伦敦16日电　英国和平委员会今天发表声明，要求英国政府和各政党领袖反对美国军事首脑和其他领导人物最近几个星期中在德国问题上发出的核战争威胁的叫嚣。
    声明说：“发出（美国）这种威胁的同时还宣布，美国在我国（英国）的火箭基地随时可以使用。”
    声明接着说：“我们提醒英国人民注意，这威胁到我国的存亡。赫鲁晓夫最近在莫斯科接见和平运动领袖时强调说，他曾提请麦克米伦记住，如果打算使用这些基地对苏联发动核战争，那么，苏联除了摧毁这些基地之外，别无他法。据说，麦克米伦在访问美国期间说过，如果有发生战争的危险，英国将把儿童撤退到英联邦的遥远地区。
    “这些事实将肯定会使我们各阶层人民相信，我国除了设法举行谈判来和平地解决使各国产生分歧的问题之外，别无他法。”
    声明要求政府不但要反对美国的威胁，而且“还要警告美国：除非它收回这种威胁，否则将采取措施不许它使用这些基地。”
