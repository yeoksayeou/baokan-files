　　After just "celebrating" the tenth anniversary of the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the contradictions between imperialists have taken on new developments. The struggle has broken out between Britain and West Germany, and between Britain and the United States. Although this contradiction revolves around the issues of Berlin and Germany, in essence, it runs through the struggle for hegemony.
　　
　　The background to this struggle is: First, the United States' position in the capitalist world has been greatly weakened as a result of the economic crisis and its aggressive policies encountering setbacks everywhere. For example, the United States' share of total exports in the capitalist world was 25.4% in 1957, but fell to 23.2% last year. Dulles' brinkmanship policy, on the one hand, has intensified the international situation, but on the other hand, it has also mobilized people all over the world to oppose Washington's aggressive policies, making the United States notorious and very isolated. Second, West Germany's strength has grown rapidly, and it is playing the role of leader in the West European "Common Market." It demands expansion economically and seeks to break the status quo politically. Third, the collapse of the colonial system has left the "British Empire" tottering. In order to maintain its status as a major power, Britain, in its relations with its "allies," must suppress West Germany on the one hand, and take the opportunity to show a bit of "independence" from the United States on the other. It is on this premise that Britain has set its current foreign policy. Conservative Party Chairman Hailsham summarized this policy as: "We must oppose the communist 'conspiracy' against human freedom, but at the same time negotiate with it. We cannot disarm unilaterally, but we must seek disarmament through agreements. We cannot quarrel with our allies, but we believe that we cannot let ourselves drift along with the tide at present."
　　
　　For more than a month, relations between Britain and West Germany have been very tense. When Macmillan visited the Soviet Union, Adenauer was full of suspicion and instructed West German diplomats in London to collect British newspaper reports to study British diplomatic trends. Shortly after Macmillan's visit to Bonn, Adenauer denounced all plans to limit armaments in Central Europe as "bad plans."
　　
　　After Adenauer delivered a radio address on the evening of the 8th, the relations between Britain and West Germany changed from covert struggle to open strife, and from behind-the-scenes infighting to public quarreling. Adenauer formally rejected the so-called "Macmillan Plan," which advocated limiting armed forces in Central Europe, and accused the British newspapers of attacking him with "behind-the-scenes manipulation." The next day, several major London newspapers immediately counterattacked. The "Daily Mail" wrote: West Germany has become "the leader of the Common Market. It has surpassed Britain in some industrial products and has squeezed us out of some traditional markets," "We know that a rich and powerful Germany is by no means a good neighbor to Britain."
　　
　　In Britain's relations with the United States, Britain is taking advantage of the difficulties the United States is encountering in diplomacy to demand a greater share of leadership; while the United States is trying to maintain its position. Following Montgomery's article on March 29, the "New Statesman" magazine, published on the 4th of this month, attacked the weakness and incompetence of the US government. It wrote: "Perhaps no great power in history has had such a rigid government as the United States has today. This is not only due to the shortcomings of its two heads of state—President Eisenhower and Dulles. Not to mention that one of them is old and infirm and the other is seriously ill, the government itself is also lifeless." The author of the article believes that in diplomacy, the United States is blind and confused. He said: "Apart from occasional aimless outbursts such as landing marines in Lebanon, the United States under Eisenhower has never taken the initiative on any issue anywhere." Britain's best-selling "Daily Mirror" published a full-page commentary on April 3 criticizing the US for "military rule" and specifically condemned Norstad, Twining, and White, who had recently made hawkish remarks—"These figures wearing epaulettes are messing things up." The "New York Times" of the United States judged these remarks in the British press in this way: "They seem to think that if the United States needs Britain as an ally, it must treat Britain as an ally, not as a vassal."
　　
　　Of course, the struggle between the United States and Britain is by no means limited to verbal disputes. Following Macmillan, British Field Marshal Montgomery decided to visit the Soviet Union at the end of the month. British newspapers frankly believe that although Montgomery has repeatedly stated that this is only a private visit, his action is undoubtedly to increase the value of the "Macmillan Plan," because this plan is in danger of disappearing due to the rejection of the United States, France, and West Germany.
　　
　　These complex relationships between the imperialist blocs caused the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council held in Washington at the beginning of this month to end in discord. The original intention of this meeting was to formulate a "common policy" for the West on the German and Berlin issues. Now, this task has to be handed over to a working group composed of representatives from the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany, which will meet in London next week to discuss it. However, since the contradictions between Western countries surrounding the Berlin issue run through the struggle for hegemony, it can be asserted that the experts of the four-nation group will never be able to quell this struggle and suddenly create a "united" situation.

　　明争暗斗
　　本报记者　潘非
    在刚刚“庆祝”过北大西洋集团成立十周年之后，帝国主义之间的矛盾又有了新的发展。斗争爆发在英国和西德、英国和美国之间。这一矛盾虽然是围绕着柏林和德国问题展开的，但实质上，却贯穿着争夺霸权的斗争。
    爆发这一斗争的背景是：一、美国由于经济危机以及侵略政策到处碰壁的结果，在资本主义世界中的地位已大为削弱。例如，美国在资本主义世界的出口总额中，1957年还占25.4％，到去年已下降到23.2％。杜勒斯的战争边缘政策，一方面使国际局势趋于紧张，但同时也动员了全世界人民起来反对华盛顿的侵略政策，使得美国声名狼籍，十分孤立。二、西德的实力迅速增长，在西欧“共同市场”中充当盟主。它在经济上要求扩张，在政治上要求打破现状。三、殖民体系的瓦解已使“大英帝国”摇摇欲坠。为了保持自己的大国地位，英国在同它的“盟国”的关系上，一方面必须压制西德，另方面又乘机对美国闹一点“独立性”。正是在这一前提下，英国规定了它在目前的外交政策。保守党主席黑尔什姆把这一政策归纳为：“我们要反对共产主义对人类自由的‘阴谋’，但同时要同它谈判。我们不能单独解除武装，但我们要用协议的办法来寻求裁军。我们不能同我们的盟国争吵，但我们相信在目前不能让自己随波逐流。”
    一个多月以来，英国和西德的关系一直十分紧张。当麦克米伦访问苏联时，阿登纳满腹狐疑，曾指令西德驻伦敦的外交官搜集英国报纸的报道，研究英国的外交动向。在麦克米伦访问波恩后不久，阿登纳即斥责所有企图在中欧限制武装的计划。都是“坏计划”。
    阿登纳在8日晚发表了广播演说以后，英国同西德的关系，已从暗斗变成明争，从幕后的倾轧变成公开的吵架。阿登纳正式拒绝了主张在中欧限制武装力量的所谓“麦克米伦计划”，并指责英国报纸对他的攻击是有“幕后操纵”的。第二天，伦敦的几家大报立即进行反击。“每日邮报”写道：西德已成为“共同市场的领袖。它在某些工业产品上已经超过了英国，并且把我们挤出某些传统市场之外”，“我们知道，一个富足的、强大的德国，决不是英国的好邻居。”
    在英国同美国的关系上，英国正利用美国在外交上所遭遇到的困难，要求分享到更多的领导权；而美国则力图维护自己的地位。继蒙哥马利3月29日的文章以后，本月4日出版的“新政治家”杂志，又攻击美国政府的孱弱和无能。它写道：“也许历史上没有那一个强国像美国今天那样拥有一个极其僵硬的政府。这不仅仅是由于它的两个首脑人物——艾森豪威尔总统和杜勒斯的缺点。不说他们两人中一个年老力衰和另一个身染重病，政府本身也是毫无生机。”文章的作者认为，在外交上，美国是盲目的，糊涂的。他说：“除了像派陆战队在黎巴嫩登陆之类的偶尔的毫无目的的奋发之外，艾森豪威尔治下的美国从未在任何地方就任何问题采取过主动。”英国销路最广的“每日镜报”，4月3日以一版整版篇幅，发表评论批评美国“军人当政”曾指名谴责最近发表好战言论的诺斯塔德、特文宁和怀特——“这些佩带肩章的人物，把事情搞糟了。”美国“纽约时报”对英国报刊的这些言论，是这样判断的：“他们似乎是这样认为的，那就是如果美国需要英国作为盟友，那就必须照一个盟友那样看待英国，而不是把它当作一个附庸看待。”
    当然，美英之间的斗争，决不仅仅限于口头的争吵。继麦克米伦之后，英国元帅蒙哥马利决定在月终访问苏联。英国报纸坦率地认为，尽管蒙哥马利一再声明这只是私人的访问，但他的这一行动无疑是为了提高“麦克米伦计划”的身价，因为这一计划已因美、法、西德的拒绝而有烟消云散的危险。
    帝国主义集团间这些错综复杂的关系，使得本月初在华盛顿举行的北大西洋集团理事会不欢而散。这次会议原来要制订出西方在德国和柏林问题上的“共同政策”，现在，不得不把这一任务交给由美、英、法、西德四国代表所组成的工作小组，下周在伦敦开会讨论。但是，既然西方国家围绕着柏林问题的矛盾，贯穿着争夺霸权的斗争，那么可以断言，四国小组的专家们，决不可能平息这场斗争，忽然创造出一个“团结”的局面。
