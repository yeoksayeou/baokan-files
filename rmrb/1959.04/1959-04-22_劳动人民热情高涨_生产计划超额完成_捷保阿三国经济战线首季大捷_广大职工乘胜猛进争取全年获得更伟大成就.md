Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 21st: A dispatch from our correspondent: This year, in the first quarter, the laboring people of Czechoslovakia scored another victory on the economic front. Many major industrial production sectors have completed or exceeded their plans. The industrial production plan for January and February was fulfilled at 100.6%, with major industrial products increasing by 11.2% compared to the same period last year; the March plan was also completed smoothly.

This year, the key sectors of the Czechoslovak national economy, metallurgy and machinery industries, achieved tremendous successes. Preliminary statistics show that steel and iron production in the first quarter increased by 10% compared to the same period last year. To make up for the shortfall in steel production last year, workers actively responded to the call from the trade union to increase steel production by 75,000 tons this year. In the first quarter alone, they produced an extra 42,000 tons of steel, completing 56% of the increased production plan.

The main products of the heavy machinery industry also exceeded the first quarter production plan. The state-designated production tasks for rolling and metallurgical equipment, cement factory equipment, diesel engines, locomotives, etc., have all been completed or exceeded according to plan.

Saving raw materials is a crucial task for the metallurgy and machinery sectors. In the first quarter, 170 machinery factories pledged to save 34,000 tons of metal materials. Scrap metal factories across the country also over-collected more than 16,000 tons of scrap metal in the first quarter, and many metallurgical factories are making full use of scrap metal for smelting.

The successful completion of the first quarter production plan laid a solid foundation for the smooth development of the national economy throughout the year. The planned rate of increase in Czechoslovakia's national economic development this year is not only faster than last year, but also higher than the 1959 targets stipulated in the revised Five-Year Plan of July and August last year; the industrial production increase target alone has been raised by 5.4 billion crowns.

Inspired by the plan to rapidly develop the national economy, the laboring people's labor and political enthusiasm has been extremely high this year. Currently, there is an increasing number of units in various factories striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," and workers have universally put forward individual and collective pledges. For example, in the machinery industry sector, workers have put forward 456 enterprise and factory-wide pledges. Some machinery factories have also launched a "Everyone Engages in Creative Inventions" movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, April 21st: Many industrial enterprises in Bulgaria have completed their first quarter production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets.

Sofia is the largest industrial center in the country, and its industrial output value accounts for more than 20% of the country's total industrial output value. The broad masses of workers here completed the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule, producing products worth more than 4 million leva for the state.

Workers in Bulgaria's mining sector have achieved outstanding results, overfulfilling the first quarter production plan by 31.6%.

Workers at Bulgaria's national power stations produced over 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity above the planned amount in the first quarter. In Ruse, one of the major industrial centers, workers at the "Kalaminchev" factory completed over 110% of the first quarter production plan.

Advancing alongside the workers, agricultural laborers continue to make rapid progress in spring plowing. The state sowing plans for oats, peas, and sugar beets have been overfulfilled. As of April 7, the sown area of sunflowers, alfalfa, hemp, potatoes, and corn was more than 2.47 million dekar (one dekar equals 1.5 mu) larger than the same period last year. Topdressing and moisture conservation work for overwintering crops have also achieved good results, with over 12.58 million dekar of overwintering crops having been topdressed. In addition, water conservancy construction, utilization of wasteland and vacant land, fertilizer transportation, and other work are also being carried out intensively.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 21st: The Albanian Ministry of Industry and Mining announced that in the first quarter of this year, Albanian industrial and mining enterprises completed 104.2% of the original state plan. The production plans of some major industrial and mining sectors were completed even better; for example, the iron-nickel ore industry completed 114.4%, the cement industry completed 108.6%, and the asphalt industry completed 106.9%. The copper and chromium mining industries both completed 102%, and various food processing industries completed their plans at 101% to 106%, respectively.

According to incomplete statistics, in the first quarter, more than 290 advanced enterprises across the country fulfilled their increased production plans ahead of schedule by ten days to half a month. For example, chromium miners over-extracted 1,242 tons of chromium ore above the plan, textile workers produced more than 92,000 meters of cotton cloth, and the local industry in the Lushnjë district not only increased the production of products worth 8 million lek, but has already started the May work for the second quarter.

According to the plan formulated by the Albanian State Planning Commission, the total national industrial output value this year will increase by 17% compared to last year, and the production of various industrial and mining sectors will increase by 10% to 20% compared to last year.

In order to overfulfill this year's production plan and greet the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation, the broad masses of workers extensively launched socialist labor competitions in the first quarter. Districts challenge districts, factories challenge factories, and workshops challenge workshops in friendly competition. The competition initiative put forward by the young workers of the Stalin Textile Factory to strive for the title of "Liberation 15th Anniversary Group" has been echoed by more than 300 workshop groups across the country. Due to the workers' high level of labor enthusiasm, the labor productivity of industrial and mining enterprises in the first quarter increased rapidly compared to the same period last year. For example, the petroleum industry increased by 15%, the chromium mining industry increased by 11%, the machinery industry increased by 14%, and the iron-nickel ore industry increased by 31%.

    捷保阿三国经济战线首季大捷
    广大职工乘胜猛进争取全年获得更伟大成就
    新华社布拉格21日电　本社记者报道：今年第一季度捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民在经济战线上又打了一次胜仗。许多主要的工业生产部门都完成或超额完成了计划。1、2月份工业生产计划完成了100.6％，主要工业产品比去年同期增加了11.2％；3月份的计划也完成得很顺利。
    今年，捷克斯洛伐克发展国民经济的重点部门冶金和机械工业部门获得了巨大的成就。据初步统计，今年第一季度钢和铁的生产都比去年同期增加了10％。为了弥补去年钢铁生产的不足，工人们积极响应了工会提出的今年增产七万五千吨钢的号召。仅在第一季度，他们就多生产了四万二千吨钢，完成了增产计划的56％。
    重型机械工业部门的主要产品也超额完成了第一季度生产计划。国家所指定的轧钢和冶金设备、水泥工厂设备、柴油机、机车等的生产任务都已按计划完成或超额完成。
    节约原材料是冶金和机械部门一项极重要的任务，在第一季度中，有一百七十个机械工厂提出了节约金属材料三万四千吨的保证。全国各州的废铁工厂在第一季度中也超额收集了一万六千多吨废铁，不少的冶金工厂正充分利用废铁进行冶炼。
    第一季度生产计划的胜利完成给今年全年国民经济的顺利发展打下了良好的基础。捷克斯洛伐克今年国民经济发展计划中规定的增产速度不仅比去年快，而且也比去年7、8月间修改过的五年计划中规定的1959年的指标有所提高，单是工业增产的指标就提高了五十四亿克朗。
    为快速发展国民经济的计划所鼓舞，今年以来劳动人民的劳动和政治热情十分高涨。目前，在各工厂中争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的单位日益增多，工人们普遍提出了个人保证和集体保证。例如，在机械工业部门，工人们就提出了四百五十六项全企业和工厂的保证。有些机械工厂还开展了“人人搞创造发明”的运动。
    新华社索非亚21日电　保加利亚各地的许多工业企业都提前和超额完成了今年第一季度生产任务。
    索非亚是全国最大的一个工业中心，其工业产品总值占全国工业产品总值的20％以上。这里的广大职工们提前完成了今年第一季度的生产计划，给国家多生产了价值四百万列弗以上的产品。
    保加利亚采矿业部门的职工创造了优异的成绩，他们超额完成了第一季度生产计划的31.6％。
    保加利亚全国发电站的职工在第一季里超计划多生产了一亿度电以上。在大工业中心之一的鲁西市，“卡拉明切夫”工厂的职工完成了第一季度生产计划的110％以上。
    与工人并肩跃进的农业劳动者们在春耕工作中继续取得迅速进展。燕麦、豌豆和甜菜的国家播种计划，已超额完成。到4月7日止，向日葵、苜蓿、大麻、土豆和玉蜀黍的播种面积比去年同期多二百四十七万多狄卡尔（一狄卡尔一点五市亩）给越冬作物的追肥和保墒工作也获得了很好的成绩，单是施过追肥的越冬作物已达一千二百五十八万多狄卡尔。此外，兴修水利、利用荒地和空地、运肥等工作也在紧张进行。
    新华社地拉那21日电　阿尔巴尼亚工业和采矿部宣布，今年第一季度阿尔巴尼亚工矿企业的生产完成了国家原订计划的104.2％。一些主要工矿部门的生产计划完成得更好，例如，铁镍矿工业完成114.4％，水泥工业完成108.6％，沥青工业完成106.9％。铜矿和铬矿工业都完成了102％，各类食品加工业分别以101％到106％完成了计划。
    据不完全统计，在第一季度中，全国有二百九十多个先进企业单位提前十天到半个月实现了自己的增产计划，例如，铬矿工人超计划开采了一千二百四十二吨铬矿，纺织工人增产了九万二千多公尺棉布，鲁施尼亚区的地方工业不仅增产了价值八百万里克的产品，并且已经开始了第二季度的5月份的工作。
    根据阿尔巴尼亚国家计划委员会制订的计划，今年全国工业总产值将比去年增加17％，各工矿部门的生产都将比去年增加10％到20％。
    为了超额完成今年的生产计划和迎接阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年，广大职工在第一季度中广泛地展开了社会主义劳动竞赛。区与区、厂与厂、车间与车间都提出友谊挑战。斯大林纺织工厂的青年工人所提出的争取“解放十五周年小组”称号的竞赛倡议，获得了全国三百多个车间小组的响应。由于工人们发挥了高度的劳动热情，第一季度工矿企业的劳动生产率比去年同一时期有了迅速的提高，例如，石油工业提高了15％，铬矿工业提高了11％，机械工业提高了14％，铁镍矿工业则提高了31％。（附图片）
