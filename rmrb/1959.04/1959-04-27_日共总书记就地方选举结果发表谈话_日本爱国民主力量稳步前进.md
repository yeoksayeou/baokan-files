Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto stated on the 25th that the results of the local elections held on the 23rd prove that Japan's patriotic and democratic forces are advancing step by step in a down-to-earth manner.

Miyamoto said that the current international and domestic situation is favorable to the democratic forces in Japan, so the democratic forces have the possibility of further development in the city, town, and village elections and the House of Councillors election to be held on the 30th of this month and early June.

He said that if all democratic forces firmly hold high the banner of fighting against US imperialism and Japan's traitorous monopoly capital, and unite to launch a resolute struggle, this possibility will become a reality.

Miyamoto expressed that the Japanese Communist Party is willing to stand at the forefront of the struggle, and he also expressed the hope that the Socialist Party will raise a clearer banner and unite with all the people to launch an uncompromising struggle against the US-Japan reactionaries.

When talking about the results achieved by the Japanese Communist Party in this election struggle, Miyamoto said that the Japanese Communist Party's candidates for governor in seven prefectures including Iwate and Akita received 480,000 votes, and a total of 430,000 votes in the election of assembly members in Tokyo, Hokkaido, prefectures, and counties, an increase of 120,000 votes compared with the previous election. Miyamoto pointed out that this election was held under the circumstances that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party carried out illegal suppression of the Japanese Communist Party and obstructed the election of Japanese Communist Party candidates, but the Japanese Communist Party still achieved success. This achievement is a concrete reflection of the Japanese Communist Party's strengthening of party unity and active development of activities since the Seventh National Congress.

Miyamoto said that this is also the result of the Japanese Communist Party's policy of preventing revision and striving for the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and uncompromisingly fighting against the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published an editorial on the 24th, exposing that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party instructed fascist violent groups to adopt various despicable means in this local election to obstruct the election of candidates from democratic forces.

The newspaper pointed out that these right-wing groups, under the guise of fabricated so-called "JCP Revolutionary Comrades Association" and "Sohyo Comrades Association," spread various leaflets insulting candidates from democratic forces. They even fabricated rumors that the candidates jointly nominated by the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and progressive groups, "Hachiro Arita is dead." "Akahata" pointed out that these are all methods used by Hitler in the past. The Kishi Nobusuke government's use of such shameful methods does not indicate that their position has been strengthened; on the contrary, it proves that they are becoming more isolated among the people. "Akahata" also exposed that the Kishi Nobusuke government used the method of extensively publicizing the Crown Prince's wedding to divert people's attention from politics.

"Akahata" called on the democratic forces to unite, be vigilant, strengthen the struggle, and smash the political conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government to prevent them from revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty." Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 26: Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki said in Osaka today regarding the results of the local elections that the number of votes obtained by the Socialist Party in this local election has increased considerably, and the proportion of seats in local councils has increased from 18% before the election to 26%.

The Socialist Party leader severely condemned Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's despicable behavior of using violent organizations, police forces, and money in the local elections to undermine the election law and obstruct the election of candidates from democratic forces.

Xinhua News Agency: The results of the gubernatorial elections in twenty prefectures and counties in Japan have been announced. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which still has a large influence in rural areas and localities, seized the majority of gubernatorial positions; however, the number of votes obtained by the democratic forces in this election exceeded that of the Liberal Democratic Party.

The voting for this gubernatorial election was held on the 23rd. According to the vote counting results on the evening of the 24th: ten candidates from the Liberal Democratic Party and those who support the Liberal Democratic Party were elected; three candidates from the Socialist Party and those who support democratic parties were elected; the other six elected candidates were jointly nominated by the Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party; the governor of Tokushima Prefecture was re-elected by the previous governor because no one participated in the election.

In the four places where the competition between the conservative and progressive parties was more intense, the Socialist Party won in Fukuoka Prefecture; the Liberal Democratic Party candidate was elected by a slight majority in Tokyo, Osaka, and Hokkaido.

Xinhua News Agency: Japan's progressive forces have made considerable progress in the national prefectural assembly elections, and the ruling party has lost a large number of seats.

According to reports, based on the results of this election of assembly members in forty-six prefectures and counties in Japan, the number of seats held by the Socialist Party in all local councils has increased from 459 to 562, an increase of 103 seats compared to before the election.

In the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly, the Socialist Party already holds 33 seats, overwhelming the Liberal Democratic Party, which holds 31 seats. The number of seats held by the democratic forces in the local councils of Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagano, Hokkaido, and other places has also exceeded one-third.

Twelve candidates from the Japanese Communist Party were elected as members of local councils, an increase of three from before the election. At the same time, the Japanese Communist Party won one seat each in the assemblies of Toyama Prefecture, Ishikawa Prefecture, and Hiroshima Prefecture, where the Japanese Communist Party had never had seats.

After this election, the proportion of seats held by progressive forces in the national prefectural-level local councils has increased from one-fifth before the election to one-quarter.

In contrast, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is becoming increasingly unpopular and has lost 155 seats in local councils. The 1,601 seats it won in this election account for 60% of all seats, a decrease of 11% from before the election.

According to reports in Japanese bourgeois newspapers on the 25th, Japanese monopoly capital has expressed concern about the progress made by progressive forces.

    日共总书记就地方选举结果发表谈话
    日本爱国民主力量稳步前进
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治25日发表谈话指出，23日举行的地方选举结果证明，日本爱国民主力量正在一步步脚踏实地地前进。
    宫本说，目前国际和国内形势有利于日本民主力量，因此在本月30日和6月初举行的市、町、村选举和参议员选举中，民主力量有进一步获得发展的可能。
    他说，如果所有的民主力量坚决高举起同美帝国主义和日本卖国垄断资本进行斗争的旗帜，并且团结起来展开坚决的斗争，这种发展的可能性就会变成现实。
    宫本表示，日本共产党愿意站在斗争的前列，他并且表示希望社会党举起更加鲜明的旗帜，同全体人民团结一起，对美日反动派展开不妥协的斗争。
    宫本在谈到日共在这次选举斗争中取得的结果时说，日本共产党在岩手、秋田等七个县提出的知事候选人获得了四十八万张选票，并且在都、道、府、县议员选举中获得共四十三万张选票。比前届选举增加了十二万张。宫本指出，这次选举是在岸信介内阁和自由民主党对日本共产党实行非法镇压和阻挠日本共产党候选人当选的情况之下举行的，但是日本共产党还是获得了成就。这个成就是日本共产党在第七次全国代表大会以后加强党的团结和积极展开活动的具体反映。
    宫本说，这也是由于日本共产党实行阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的政策，毫不妥协地对岸信介内阁和自由民主党进行斗争的结果。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”24日发表社论，揭露岸信介政府和自由民主党在这次地方选举中指使法西斯暴力团体采取各种卑鄙手段阻挠民主力量的候选人当选。
    报纸指出，这些右翼团体假借捏造的所谓“日共革命同志会”和“总评同志会”的名义，散布了各种侮辱民主力量候选人的传单。它们甚至造谣说社会党、共产党和进步团体联合提出的候选人“有田八郎死了”。“赤旗报”指出，这些都是从前希特勒用过的手段。岸信介政府施用这样可耻的手段并不表明它们的地位有了加强，相反地是证明它们在人民中间正更加孤立。“赤旗报”还揭露岸信介政府利用大肆宣传皇太子结婚事件的手法来转移人民对政治的注意。
    “赤旗报”号召民主力量团结起来，提高警惕，加强斗争，粉碎岸信介政府这种政治阴谋，阻止它们修改日美“安全条约”。新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎今天在大阪就地方选举结果发表谈话说，社会党在这次地方选举中获得的选票有
  了相当的增加，在地方议会议席中所占比例已经从选举前的18％增加到26％。
    这位社会党领袖严厉谴责了日本首相岸信介在地方选举中利用暴力组织、警察力量和金钱，破坏选举法，阻挠民主力量候选人当选的卑鄙行为。
    据新华社讯　日本二十个都、道、府、县的知事选举结果已经揭晓。在农村和地方上仍然有较大影响的执政党自由民主党攫去了多数知事职位；但是，民主力量在这次选举中得到的选票却超过了自由民主党。
    这次知事选举的投票是在23日举行的。在24日晚上的计票结果是：自由民主党和支持自由民主党的候选人中有十名当选；社会党和支持民主党派的候选人中有三名当选；另外六名当选的候选人是自由民主党和社会党联合提出的；德岛县的县知事由于在选举中无人参加竞选，由前任知事连任。
    在保守政党和进步政党竞争得比较激烈的四个地方，社会党在福冈县获得胜利；自由民主党的候选人以微弱的多数在东京都、大阪府、北海道当选。
    据新华社讯　日本进步力量在全国县议会选举中获得相当进展，执政党丧失了大量议席。
    据报道，根据日本的这次四十六个都、道、府、县议会议员的选举结果，社会党在所有地方议会中的议席从四百五十九席增加到五百六十二席，比选举前增加了一百零三席。
    在福冈县议会中，社会党已经占有三十三议席，压倒了占三十一席的自由民主党。民主力量在东京都、大阪府、京都府、长野县、北海道等地方议会里的议席也都超过了三分之一。
    日本共产党的十二名候选人当选为地方议会的议员，比选举以前增加了三名，同时在日本共产党从来没有议席的富山县、石川县和广岛县的议会中分别获得了一个席位。
    经过这次选举，进步力量在全国县一级地方议会里所占的议席比数已经从选举前的五分之一增加到四分之一。
    与这种情况相反，执政的自由民主党越来越不得人心，在地方议会中丧失了一百五十五议席。它在这次选举中获得的一千六百零一个议席占全部议席的60％，比选举前减少了11％。
    据日本资产阶级报纸25日报道，日本垄断资本已经对进步力量的获得进展表示不安。
