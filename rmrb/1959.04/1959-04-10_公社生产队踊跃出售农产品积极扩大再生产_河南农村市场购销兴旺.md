The People's Communes and Production Teams Eagerly Sell Agricultural Products and Actively Expand Reproduction
Henan Rural Market Booming
The province's cotton, tobacco, live pigs, and fresh egg purchases have increased significantly.
Commercial departments organize forces to go deep into the countryside for large-scale purchases and sales to promote the spring production upsurge.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 9th (Reporter Zhang Hailan) – Since the people's communes in various parts of Henan Province have launched a vigorous spring production upsurge, many new changes have occurred in the rural market. The most prominent of these is that the people's communes and production brigades are enthusiastically selling agricultural and sideline products to the state, actively developing diversified economies, proactively signing purchase and sales contracts with commercial departments, and purchasing production materials. This new situation in the current rural economy is very beneficial for promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production and making good market arrangements.

In order to expand reproduction and increase the income of commune members, the production brigades and production teams of various people's communes have recently increased their sales of agricultural and sideline products and local specialties to the state, and the purchases of commercial departments in various places have risen sharply. Compared with early March, the province's cotton purchase volume increased by more than double, tobacco purchase volume increased by 40%, live pig purchase volume increased by 33.5%, and fresh egg purchase volume increased by more than double. In late March, Qingfeng County purchased three times more live pigs than in mid-March. The commercial departments of Xinyang Prefecture purchased 430,000 catties of eggs from March 20th to 26th, more than double the purchase volume of the previous eighty days.

In addition to actively carrying out the production of main crops, the production teams of various people's communes also have a high interest in developing diversified economies. Many commune members of the people's communes have asked commercial departments to purchase small poultry and small livestock in preparation for developing the breeding industry. In the past ten days, the Gucheng People's Commune in Qingfeng County has newly built eight rabbit farms and fifty-three pig farms. The Zhaojiaying People's Commune in Shenqiu County mobilized the masses and planted more than 4,000 mu of Vitex, reeds, lotus roots, fruit trees, vegetables, medicinal materials, and minor oil crops in two days. According to statistics from the Provincial Department of Commerce, the total value of diversified operations developed by the province's people's communes in mid-March increased by 30% compared with early March.

The leap in production has created favorable conditions for commercial departments to sign and fulfill purchase and sales contracts with the people's communes. Since March, the contract system between grassroots commercial departments and communes and production teams throughout the province has seen new development. In the past, when commercial departments signed purchase and sales contracts for agricultural and sideline products with the communes, the communes always emphasized labor shortages and no one to produce; now, driven by the production enthusiasm of the masses, many communes and production teams have actively requested to sign contracts with commercial departments. Three production teams of the Gucheng People's Commune in Qingfeng County signed purchase and sales contracts with commercial departments worth more than 100,000 yuan in a few days. In mid-March, commercial departments throughout the province signed more than 10,000 contracts with commune production teams, an increase of more than 66% compared with early March; more than 6,000 contracts were fulfilled, an increase of nearly 31% compared with early March.

Due to the increased attendance rate of commune members and the development of diversified economies, the production materials required by the communes from commercial departments have also increased significantly compared with the previous period. According to surveys, the communes now need generally 30% to 50% more chemical fertilizers, pesticides, livestock, and farm implements than originally planned. A prominent example is the Cuijiaqiao Caoma Production Brigade in Anyang County, which requested one and a half times more production materials than originally planned.

At present, commercial departments in various parts of Henan Province are focusing on the new situation in the current market, organizing forces to go deep into communes and production teams to carry out large-scale purchasing and sales. The Zhidian Commercial Department in Shenqiu County dispatched ninety-four cadres to purchase agricultural and sideline products from communes, teams, and households. In just nine days, the value of sideline products purchased was equivalent to 172% of the first quarter's purchase plan; the value of goods supplied was equivalent to 89% of the first quarter's supply plan. After a concentrated purchase in Xuchang Prefecture, nearly 800,000 catties of tobacco were purchased from March 21st to 25th in 5 days, an increase of 40% compared with the previous five days. In order to promote the production enthusiasm of communes and production teams, commercial departments throughout the province have launched a high tide of material supply to serve spring plowing production.

### 公社生产队踊跃出售农产品积极扩大再生产  河南农村市场购销兴旺

    公社生产队踊跃出售农产品积极扩大再生产
    河南农村市场购销兴旺
    全省棉花、烟叶、生猪、鲜蛋收购量已显著增加
    商业部门组织力量深入农村大购大销促进春季生产高潮
    新华社郑州9日电 记者章海兰报道：河南省各地人民公社掀起蓬勃的春季生产高潮以后，引起了农村市场上许多新的变化。最突出的是人民公社和生产大队踊跃向国家出售农副产品，积极发展多种经济，主动和商业部门签订购销合同，纷纷添购生产资料。当前农村经济呈现的这种新局面，对于促进工农业生产的发展，做好市场安排，很有好处。
    各人民公社的生产大队和生产队，为了扩大再生产，增加社员收入，最近向国家出售的农副产品和土特产品日益增加，各地商业部门的收购量都在急剧上升。3月中旬与上旬比较，全省棉花收购量增长一倍以上，烟叶收购量增长40％，生猪收购量上升33.5％，鲜蛋收购量上升一倍以上。清丰县3月下旬收购的生猪比中旬增长三倍。信阳专区商业部门在3月20日到26日收购鸡蛋四十三万斤，比前八十天的收购量还多一倍多。
    各人民公社生产队除了积极搞好主要农作物的生产以外，发展多种经济的兴趣也很高，许多人民公社的社员们到商业部门要求购买小家禽、小家畜准备发展饲养业。清丰县固城人民公社在最近十天中，新建了养兔场八个、养猪场五十三个。沈丘县赵家营人民公社发动群众，在两天内种植了荆条、苇子、藕、果木、蔬菜、药材、小宗油料作物等共四千多亩。据省商业部门统计，全省各人民公社3月中旬发展多种经营的总值比上旬增加了30％。
    生产的飞跃发展，为商业部门与人民公社签订和实现购销合同创造了良好条件。3月份以来，全省各地基层商业部门与公社、生产队之间的合同制有了新的发展。过去，商业部门与公社签订农副产品购销合同，公社总是强调劳动力紧张，没有人生产；现在许多公社、生产队在群众的生产热情推动下，都主动要求与商业部门订立合同。清丰县固城人民公社三个生产队，在几天内就与商业部门签订了总值十万多元的购销合同。3月中旬，全省商业部门与公社生产队共签订了一万多份合同，比上旬增加66％以上；实现的合同达六千多份，比上旬增加近31％。
    各公社由于社员出勤率提高和多种经济的发展，要求商业部门供应的生产资料也比前一个时期大有增长。据调查，各公社现在需要的化肥、农药、牲畜、药械等，一般都比原规划增长30％到50％。比较突出的如安阳县崔家桥曹马生产大队，要求供应的生产资料比原规划增加了一倍半。
    目前，河南省各地商业部门针对当前市场上的这种新情况，组织力量深入公社、生产队，开展大购大销业务。沈丘县纸店商业部门抽出九十四名干部，到社、队、户收购农副产品，仅九天内收购的副业产品，总值就相当于第一季度收购计划的172％；供应的商品，总值相当于第一季度供应计划的89％。许昌专区经过突击收购，3月21日到25日5天收购烟叶近八十万斤，比前五天上升40％。为了促进公社、生产队的生产积极性，目前全省商业部门掀起了为春耕生产服务的物资供应高潮。
