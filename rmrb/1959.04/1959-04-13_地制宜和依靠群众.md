　　Adapting to Local Conditions and Relying on the Masses
　　Yang Ling
　　"Adapting to local conditions" and "relying on the masses" are inseparable.

　　Doing things requires considering the time, place, and conditions. This is a truth that most people know and are willing to follow. However, it is often not done very well. The reason may lie in the word "do," or it may lie in the word "see." If you see correctly but do incorrectly, it will naturally not work. If you see incorrectly, it is even more impossible to do correctly.

　　How to see? See more, and see comprehensively. See the past situation, and also see the current changes; see the different characteristics of different locations, and also see the common factors between different places; see the possibilities of objective conditions, and also see the subjective initiative.

　　How can we see comprehensively? Many people need to see. One person often only sees one side, or even just a line or a point. Mobilize the masses to see, and then discuss it together, forming a common view, which makes it easier to see comprehensively. In this process, we cannot ignore the views of a few people or even one person. The majority is originally composed of one individual after another. At least one person can see one point or one side, and people with more experience and higher knowledge can see not only one side but also the whole picture. Therefore, to correctly exert leadership, we must be good at consulting with others, consulting more with the masses, and consulting more with comrades.

　　The case of Fuyuan County arranging the planting area of various crops fully illustrates that only by consulting with the masses can we adapt to local conditions. Because the masses are most familiar with the past planting situation in terms of "time," most familiar with the local soil and climate characteristics in terms of "place," and most familiar with the existing preparations and remaining potential in terms of "conditions." Although the breadth and depth of what each person sees are limited, concentrating what many people see, coupled with the knowledge and experience of the leadership, can be relatively broad and deep. The result of doing so is being good at making decisions—making the most practical decisions.

　　Being good at planning and being decisive can not only best exert existing strength but also generate new strength. From the news from Fuyuan County: after the county party committee discussed the planting plan with the masses, everyone had more confidence in realizing the plan, the attendance rate and work efficiency generally improved, and more fertilizer was accumulated. —By discussing more with the masses, the masses' horizons will also be broadened in the joint discussion; the masses can more clearly see and feel that the collective cause is also their own cause, and because they see its correctness, they believe in its inevitable victory. This is the greatest strength!

　　地制宜和依靠群众
　　杨岭
    “因地制宜”和“依靠群众”是不可分离的。
    做事情都要看时间、地点、条件。这是一条真理，大多数人都知道它，也愿意照着做。可是，往往并不能做得很好。原因，可能出在“做”字上，也可能出在“看”字上。看得对，但是做得不对，自然不行。看得不对，就更不可能做得对。
    怎样看？要多看，要全面地看。要看到过去的情形，也要看到目前的变化；要看到不同地点不同的特点，也要看到各地之间共同的因素；要看到客观条件的可能性，也要看到主观条件的能动性。
    怎样才能看得全面？要有很多人来看。一个人往往只能看到一面，甚至只是一线、一点。发动群众都来看，看了再在一起多商量，形成共同的看法，就比较容易看得全面了。在这中间，也不可以忽视少数人甚至是一个人的看法。多数人本来是由一个一个的人构成的。一个人至少能看到一点、一面，经验比较多见识比较高的人，不但能看到一面，也能看到全面。因此，要正确地发挥领导作用，就必须善与人谋，多和群众商量，多和同志们商量。
    富源县安排各种作物的种植面积的事，充分说明了同群众商量才能做到因地制宜。因为群众在“时间”方面最了解过去种植作物的情况，在“地点”方面最了解当地土质、气候的特点，在“条件”方面最了解已有的准备工作和还有的潜力。虽然每一个人看到的广度、深度有限，把许多人看到的集中起来，再加上领导方面的知识和经验，就可以比较广比较深了。这样做的结果就是善于决断——做出最切合实际的决定来。
    多谋善断，不但能最好地发挥现有的力量，还又产生了新的力量。从富源县的消息来看：县委同群众一起讨论安排种植计划之后，大家对实现计划的信心更足了，出勤率和工效普遍提高，肥料也积得更多了。——多同群众商量，群众的眼界在共同商量中也会更加开阔；群众可以更清楚地看到和感受到集体的事业也就是自己切身的事业，而且因为看到它的正确而相信它的必然胜利。这是最伟大的力量！
