Queueing – The Scientific Method of Marxism

We need to queue in arranging basic construction projects, in production planning for industrial and agricultural products, and in the allocation and use of raw materials, funds, and labor. However, not everyone has a thorough understanding of why we queue, whether queueing is a good thing or a bad thing, how to queue, and how to queue well.

As everyone knows, all things are in constant motion and development, and the movement and development of things are the result of the struggle of internal contradictions within things. However, among the various contradictions of things, not all are "equal," coexisting equally. There is always one that is the main contradiction. Even within the main contradiction, not all aspects are the same, and there must be a primary aspect of the contradiction. It is these main contradictions and the primary aspects of contradictions that determine the direction of the development of things and the main processes of things. Chairman Mao pointed out: "In studying any process, if it is a complex process involving more than two contradictions, we must do everything possible to find its principal contradiction. Once we grasp this principal contradiction, all problems can be readily solved." ("On Contradiction"). Queueing requires us to comprehensively analyze the contradictory aspects of complex objective things, identify the main contradictions, put them at the forefront, and solve them first; other secondary contradictions are then placed behind, to be solved one by one in order.

From the above analysis, it can be seen that queueing – this is a reflection of the original appearance of the development of objective things, and also a scientific method for people to use the laws of objective things to promote the faster development of things. Queueing well can accelerate the development of things; queueing poorly will delay the development of things. Queueing in our economic construction is a concrete manifestation of better utilizing people's subjective initiative on the basis of fully understanding objective economic laws, in order to promote the more rapid development of the national economy. Of course, to queue, there must be a front and a rear. In this way, some construction projects that are not urgently needed for the time being may be placed behind and not resolved for the time being. But what's wrong with that? It should be admitted that our country's economy is still relatively backward. Therefore, in terms of the scale and speed of socialist construction, the bigger and faster the better. People's desire to speed up construction is of course good. However, due to our insufficient financial and material resources, they often cannot keep up with the needs of all aspects, which creates a contradiction between needs and possibilities. In this case, we must distinguish between importance and urgency, queue up, and never rush headlong into mass action.

This method of queueing has been used effectively in various aspects. For example, the central party's policy of developing heavy industry on a priority basis with five things being undertaken simultaneously, as well as the principle of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, which one was not formulated based on the results of queueing and identifying the main contradictions? It is precisely because these policies conform to the laws of development of objective things that the implementation of these policies has enabled the entire national economy to develop forward at an astonishing rate. Therefore, the method of queueing is a scientific method of Marxism.

### 排队——马克思主义的科学方法

    排队——
    马克思主义的科学方法
    我们在基本建设项目的安排上要排队，在工农业产品产量的生产安排上要排队，在原材料、资金、劳动力的分配与使用上也要排队。但是究竟为什么要排队，排队是件好事还是件坏事，怎样去排队，怎样才能排好队等等，并不是所有的人都有透彻的了解的。
    大家知道，一切事物都是在不断运动着和发展着，而事物的运动和发展是事物内部矛盾
  斗争的结果。但是在事物的多种矛盾中，并非都是“半斤八两”，均等地并存着，其中总有一个是主要矛盾。即是在主要矛盾中，也并不是都一样，而其中一定还有一个矛盾的主要方面。正是这些主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，才决定着事物发展的方向和事物的主要过程。毛主席指出：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两
  个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾，捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了”（“矛盾论”）。而排队，就是要求我们对错综复杂的客观事物矛盾着的各个侧面，进行全面分析，抓出其中的主要矛盾，排在前头，首先加以解决；其他各种次要矛盾则排在后面，按顺序一个一个地加以解决。
    从以上的分析中可以看出，排队——这是客观事物发展的本来面目的反映，也是人们利用客观事物的规律性推动事物更快向前发展的一种科学方法。队排得好，可以加快事物的发展；队排得不好，就会延缓事物的发展。我们经济建设中的排队，也就是要在充分认识客观经济规律的基础上，更好地发挥人的主观能动作用，以促进国民经济更迅速发展的一种具体表现。当然，要排队，总得有个排头，也得有个排尾，这样，有些暂时不迫切需要的建设事业可能被排在后面，暂时不予解决。但这有什么不好呢？应该承认，我们国家的经济还比较落后，因此就社会主义建设的规模和速度来讲，真是越大越好，越快越好，人们这种要求加快建设速度的心情当然是好的。但是由于我们的财力、物力还不够充裕，又往往赶不上各方面的需要，这就产生了需要和可能之间的矛盾。在这种情况下，就必须分别轻重缓急，进行排队，决不能一拥而上。
    排队这种方法，被我们很有成效地运用在各个方面。例如党中央提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上五个并举以及以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针等，那一个不是根据排队的结果，抓出其中主要矛盾而制订的呢？正是由于这些方针符合客观事物的发展规律，因而执行这些方针的结果，就使得整个国民经济以惊人的速度向前发展。所以说排队这种方法，是一种马克思主义的科学的方法。
