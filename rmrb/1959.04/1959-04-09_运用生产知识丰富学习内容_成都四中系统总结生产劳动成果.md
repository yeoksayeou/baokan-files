Utilizing Production Knowledge to Enrich Learning Content
Chengdu No. 4 Middle School Systematically Summarizes the Results of Production Labor

(Our Newspaper, reporter Zhou Zuyou): In order to systematically organize and improve the rich practical knowledge gained in production labor, Chengdu No. 4 Middle School in Sichuan Province has launched a planned effort to guide students in summarizing their production labor.

The production labor summary at Chengdu No. 4 Middle School began last summer. In the process of implementing the Party's education policy, the school established production bases such as a machine factory, an electrical factory, a chemical factory, a handicraft workshop, and a farm. The purpose of the production labor summary is to elevate the practical knowledge students gain in production labor to the level of rational knowledge. Over the past six months, high school students alone have compiled forty volumes of written materials summarizing production labor, totaling more than 500,000 words, covering production experience in machinery, electrical engineering, chemical industry, agriculture, and other fields, involving most of the knowledge in high school physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and other subjects. Teachers and students have used part of these materials to compile fifteen new textbooks for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other subjects.

The production labor summaries of students at Chengdu No. 4 Middle School mainly take three forms: product summaries, workshop summaries, and class summaries. The product summary revolves around the manufacture of a product, and the students participating in the manufacture write theoretical and practical materials and technical data for manufacturing the product based on the actual problems encountered in the manufacturing process. For example, in summarizing the making of a blower, the students described in detail, based on their actual experience, how they used physical knowledge such as centrifugal force, friction, and center of gravity, chemical knowledge such as quenching and annealing, and stereometric knowledge such as determining parallel lines in space to solve practical problems such as increasing wind pressure and the stability of the blower during operation. In this way, students mastered the entire production process of the product and cultivated the ability to comprehensively apply various types of knowledge. Workshop summaries are closely related to a certain subject. Through summaries, students can more systematically and deeply master the knowledge of this subject. For example, the summary of the electrical workshop helps students further understand the knowledge about electricity; the summary of the chemical workshop enables students to further master the knowledge taught in the chemistry class. Class summaries are conducted on the basis of product and workshop summaries. Through class summaries, students can exchange experiences in various workshops and in manufacturing various products, making the knowledge gained more comprehensive and systematic. The entire process of production labor summarization is conducted under the guidance of teachers; sometimes, workers, technicians, teachers, and students are invited to summarize together to make up for the lack of practical experience or scientific and theoretical level of teachers and students.

In the process of summarizing, teachers collected rich and systematic materials from students' actual experiences and applied them to teaching, which played a great role in overcoming the phenomenon of teaching being divorced from reality in the past and improving the quality of teaching. For example, in the past, when some algebra teachers taught the section on imaginary numbers, students always found it difficult to understand the practical significance of imaginary numbers. Now, students have summarized the actual application of imaginary numbers in production, and after the teacher used this material in teaching, students responded: Now I have a clear understanding of the origin and development of imaginary numbers.

    运用生产知识丰富学习内容
    成都四中系统总结生产劳动成果
    本报讯　记者周祖佑报道：为了把在生产劳动中获得丰富的实际知识，加以系统的整理和提高，四川成都第四中学，开展了有计划地领导学生进行生产劳动总结。
    成都四中的生产劳动总结，是从去年夏天开始的。这个学校在贯彻党的教育方针的过程中，建立了机械厂、电工厂、化工厂、手工场和农场等生产基地。生产劳动总结的目的，就是把学生在生产劳动中获得的实际知识，上升到理性知识。半年多来，仅高中学生就编写了生产劳动总结的书面材料四十册，共五十多万字，包括了机械、电工、化工、农业等方面的生产经验，涉及高中物理、化学、数学、生物等学科的大部分知识。师生们利用这些资料的一部分，已编写出数学、物理、化学等科的新教材十五册。
    成都第四中学学生的生产劳动总结，主要有产品总结、车间总结和班级总结等三种形式。产品总结是围绕一种产品的制造，由参加制造的学生根据制造过程中的实际问题，写成理论联系实际的资料和制造该产品的技术资料。如在总结鼓风机制作时，学生们就以实际体会详细叙述了运用离心作用、摩擦力、重心等物理知识，淬火、退火等化学知识以及空间定平行线等立体几何知识，解决增加风压和鼓风机运转时的稳度等实际问题的情况。这样，就使学生掌握了产品的全部生产过程，培养综合运用各种知识的能力。车间总结，由于不同车间总是与某学科的联系更为密切。通过总结，使学生们更系统深入地掌握这门学科的知识。比如电工车间的总结，帮助学生进一步理解关于电学的知识；化工车间总结，学生们更进一步掌握了化学课中讲授的知识。班级总结是在产品、车间总结的基础上进行的。通过班级总结，学生们就可以互相交流在各车间和制造各种产品中的经验，使获得的知识更加全面和系统。生产劳动总结的整个过程，都是在教师指导下进行的；有时，还邀请工人、技术员和师生一起总结，以弥补师生实际经验或科学理论水平的不足。
    在总结过程中，教师从学生实际体会里，搜集到丰富系统的资料，运用到教学中，对克服过去教学脱离实际的现象，提高教学质量起了很大作用。如有的代数教师过去讲授虚数这一节时，学生对虚数的实际意义总难理解。现在，学生总结出虚数在生产中实际运用的情况，教师在讲授中运用这一材料后，学生反应说：这下把虚数的来龙去脉弄清楚了。
