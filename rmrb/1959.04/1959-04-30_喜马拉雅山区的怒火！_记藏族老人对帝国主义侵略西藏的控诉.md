These days, the broad masses of Tibetan monks and laypeople residing in Yatung in the Himalayan region are protesting with immense anger against the shameless interference in our country’s internal affairs by imperialists and Indian expansionists. The Tibetan people here have personally suffered the ravages of imperialism and have heroically resisted imperialist aggression and oppression.

Bai Ma Duojie, an 89-year-old residing in Galinggang village in the Yatung area, is a Tibetan elder who, in 1888, personally charged into battle with a spear, bow and arrow, and waist knife, and engaged in arduous struggle against the imperialist invading forces. These days, after hearing the news that imperialists and Indian expansionists are openly supporting a small handful of rebel elements in Tibet, he became extremely angry and repeatedly told his family and the villagers not to be fooled by the imperialists, not to listen to any slander or incitement by bad people, to love their great motherland and Chairman Mao, and to follow the Communist Party forever.

On the 23rd of this month, this reporter climbed to Galinggang in the Himalayan region to visit this elder. He eloquently accused the imperialists of their crimes of aggression against Tibet. He said: "I am 89 years old this year. When I was 18 years old, a group of British invading forces, like jackals and wolves, sneaked from India into the Himalayan region of Tibet. They built tall bunkers and several roads in the mountains, brought foreign guns and cannons, occupied the crossroads, used telescopes to scout the terrain, and questioned passing Tibetans, shamelessly telling us: 'Tibet is the place of the British, and in the future, Tibetans cannot listen to others, but must obey the management and protection of civilized people of the British Empire.'"

The elder picked up a small jar filled with highland barley wine, took a few gulps, and said: "At that time, we could not endure this immense insult. Residents from more than 30 villages from Renqinggang to Galinggang organized militias, built fortifications in Longtong, dug trenches in Zelu, and began fighting the invading forces with muskets, bows and arrows, broadswords, and spears. In this battle, because we were outnumbered, we suffered great losses. So the enemy became even more frantic, looting merchants, seizing houses, plundering the masses' property, demanding firewood and grass, and capturing people to do hard labor and serve as servants. We then organized more than 1,000 militiamen in Zaxi to prepare for resistance. At this time, reinforcements from Gyangze, Dingri, and other places arrived, all concentrated in Renqinggang, selected elite troops, and rushed to Natang. The Yatung militia served as the outposts this time, encountering the enemy in Nila in the Himalayan region and engaging in fierce fighting. From dark to dawn, shouts of killing were heard everywhere, and we charged fiercely." The elder proudly said: "This time, I charged and fought fiercely, stabbing three invading soldiers to death with a spear. Many others were even more courageous than me. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and was severely hit."

The elder paused for a moment, then said painfully: "Just as we were shedding blood and sacrificing ourselves to fight the British invading forces, the reactionary Tibetan nobles such as Xia Zhalongqin colluded with the imperialists, signed a 'treaty of surrender,' and betrayed the interests of the Tibetan people."

Then, the elder continued to accuse the imperialists of their crimes. The elder said: "In 1903, the aggressive British imperialists sent large numbers of troops from Yatung and Kanba in two routes. These people planted British flags on the surrounding mountains and extorted heavily from the people of Yatung, demanding milk, eggs, and livestock, and building barracks in Yatung and Pali, causing unrest among the people and livestock. Even so, we still resolutely refused to submit to the invaders. In the Gul area, the broad masses of Tibetans bravely struck hard at the invaders. The cunning and vicious imperialists then deceived us, saying that they would stop fighting and hold peace talks, and that as long as we extinguished the fuses of our muskets, they would withdraw. The kind-hearted Tibetans believed it to be true and extinguished all the fuses. At this moment, the invading forces opened fire with all their foreign guns, and our heroes fell one by one."

Speaking of this, the elder frowned, and said with anger and sorrow: "Imperialism is our mortal enemy, and we can never forget this blood debt! Now, a small handful of reactionaries are colluding with imperialists and Indian expansionists, they are truly depraved scum. We are Chinese, and we will never agree to the imperialists separating Tibet from the big family of the motherland."

Then, the elder spoke of how, in April of last year, more than 200 rebel bandits had come from Akang, Doulong, and other places, looting and killing for more than a month, stealing more than 20 horses, nine yaks, more than 250 jin of butter, and more than 5,000 yuan, and killing the Lama Luosang of Donggen Temple. He said, "If I were not too old, I would have personally gone to eliminate these demons. I am grateful to the central government for sending the People's Liberation Army to wipe out the rebel bandits and remove a great scourge for our Tibetan people. This is a very satisfying thing."

Speaking of this, a happy smile appeared on the elder's face, and he said excitedly, "Our China is no longer the China of 1904. The Chinese people will never allow the imperialists and foreign reactionaries to interfere with us again!"

    喜马拉雅山区的怒火！
    ——记藏族老人对帝国主义侵略西藏的控诉
    新华社记者　格来
    这几天，居住在喜马拉雅山区的亚东广大藏族僧俗人民，以无比愤怒的心情，抗议帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子无耻的干涉我国内政。这里的藏族人民亲身受过帝国主义的蹂躏，并且英勇地抗击过帝国主义的侵略压迫。
    居住在亚东地区噶岭岗村的八十九岁的白玛多杰，就是在一八八八年拿着长矛、弓箭、腰刀，亲自冲锋陷阵，和帝国主义侵略军进行艰苦斗争的藏族老人。这些天，他听到帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子公开支持西藏一小撮叛乱分子的消息以后，气愤极了，不断告诉全家和村子里的人，决不能上帝国主义的当，不要听信任何坏人的中伤和挑拨离间，要热爱自己的伟大祖国和毛主席，要永远跟着共产党走。
    本月23日，记者登上喜马拉雅山区的噶岭岗，前去访问这位老人。他滔滔不绝地控诉了帝国主义侵略西藏的罪行。他说：“我今年八十九岁了，当我十八岁的那一年，一群英国侵略军象豺狼一样，从印度那边偷窜到喜马拉雅山区的西藏来。他们在万山丛中修起高大的碉堡和好几条道路，带来洋枪洋炮，霸占路口，用望远镜侦察地形，盘问过往的藏民，无耻地向我们说：“西藏是英国人的地方，以后西藏人不能听别人的话，要服从大英帝国文明人的管理和保护”。
    老人端过盛满了青稞酒的小罐子，咕咕地喝了几口酒，说道：“当时我们怎么也忍受不住这种天大的侮辱，从仁青岗到噶岭岗三十多个村庄的居民，都组织了民兵，在隆同地方筑工事，在则洛地方修战壕，拿着火枪、弓箭、大刀、长矛和侵略军开始打仗。这一战因为寡不敌众，我们受到了很大损失。于是敌人更疯狂起来，掠劫商人，强占房屋，搜括群众财物，派柴草，捉人作苦力、当仆役。我们便在扎西地方又组织了一千多民兵准备抗击。这时，江孜、定日等各地的援兵到来，都集中在仁青岗，选拔了精锐部队，冲到纳塘。亚东的民兵这一次作了前哨，在喜马拉雅山区的尼拉地方遇上敌人，展开激战，从天黑到拂晓，到处杀声四起，猛烈冲锋。”老人骄傲地说：“这一次，我猛冲猛打，用长矛扎死了三个侵略军，还有许多人比我更加勇敢。敌人伤亡很多，受到了严重的打击。”
    老人停了一会，又痛苦地说道：正当我们流血牺牲，和英国侵略军作战的时候，西藏的反动贵族霞扎龙钦等人却和帝国主义勾结在一起，签定“城下之盟”，出卖了西藏人民的利益。
    接着，老人继续控诉了帝国主义的罪行。老人说：“1903年，侵略成性的英帝国主义又从亚东和堪班两路开来了大量军队，这些人在四周的山上插了英国旗帜，向亚东人民大肆勒索，要牛奶，要鸡蛋，要牲口，在亚东、帕里修兵营，弄得人人不安、鸡犬不宁。即使这样，我们仍然坚决不向侵略者屈服，在古尔地方，广大藏民奋不顾身狠狠打击侵略者。狡猾狠毒的帝国主义便欺骗我们，说不打了，要举行和谈，只要我们把火枪的点火绳熄灭了，他们就撤退。善良的藏民信以为真，一律熄灭了火绳。就在这个时候，侵略军全部开动洋枪，我们的英雄一个个倒下去了。”
    老人谈到这里，皱紧眉毛，愤恨而沉痛地说：“帝国主义是我们的死敌，这笔血债，我们怎么也不能忘记！现在，一小撮反动派又勾结帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，真是丧心病狂的败类。我们是中国人，绝不答应帝国主义把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去。”
    接着，老人又谈起去年4月间，从阿康、斗隆等地曾经来了两百多叛匪，掠劫抢杀了一个多月，抢走二十多匹马、九条牦牛，还有二百五十多斤酥油，五千多块钱，杀死了东根寺的喇嘛洛桑。他说：“我要不是因为年纪太大了，一定要亲自去消灭这些魔鬼。感谢中央派来解放军肃清叛匪，给我们藏族人民铲除了大祸害，这是大快人心的事。”
    谈到这里，老人脸上露出了幸福的微笑，他兴奋地说：“现在我们中国再不是1904年的中国了，帝国主义和外国反动派想再来干涉我们，中国人民决不容许！”
