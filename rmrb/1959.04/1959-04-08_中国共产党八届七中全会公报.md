    After full discussion, the plenary session approved the draft of the 1959 national economic plan.

The compilation of this draft plan has given serious consideration to both the objective possibilities of our country's material and technical conditions and the subjective initiative of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people. This is a magnificent plan that can realize the continued great leap forward of the national economy. This draft plan will be submitted by the State Council to the First Session of the Second National People's Congress for deliberation. The Central Committee is deeply convinced that under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, the people of our country will continue to exert their utmost efforts, continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, fully utilize the potential strength of all aspects, launch a vigorous and lively movement to increase production and practice economy, and will certainly be able to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan.

The plenary session pointed out that the rectification work over the past three months has been good and successful, the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eight Central Committee in December 1958 is being implemented, and the development of the rural people's commune movement is healthy. The plenary session conducted further research on the problems discovered in the rectification work, and stipulated specific solutions. The plenary session believes that after a period of continued rectification, the rural people's communes will surely be further consolidated and developed.
