Improved Seeds
    Ministry of Agriculture Seed Administration

    In 1958, the cultivated area of improved seeds in China expanded by 570 million mu, equivalent to more than half of the total area under improved seeds推广 during the First Five-Year Plan period, playing a relatively significant role in increasing production.

          Increased Production with Improved Seeds

    Due to their thick and strong stalks, tolerance to fertilizer and water, and resistance to lodging, excellent varieties have a strong resistance to certain pests, diseases, and natural disasters (many varieties are prone to lodging or pests and diseases under conditions of excessive fertilizer and water). They can fully utilize the favorable conditions of improved cultivation levels to achieve increased production. Excellent varieties of rice and wheat, for example, have neat and moderate tillering, large ears, many grains, and large grains; excellent cotton varieties have many fruit branches, many and large bolls; and excellent soybean varieties have many pods, many grains per pod, and large grains, resulting in significant increases in production.

    Among the 59 examples of high-yield rice production, mainly early and mid-season rice, collected at the National Rice Conference in November 1958, the improved indica rice variety "Nante No. 1" was planted in 11 cases, "Nante No. 16" in three cases, "Shengli Xian" in five cases, "Zhongnong No. 4" in two cases, and "Hua Nan No. 15" in three cases. Among the japonica rice varieties, "Youmang Zaojing" and "Yinfang" were each planted in four cases, "Huangke Zao Ershiri" in three cases, and "Nonglin No. 16," "10509," and "Laolaiqing" in two cases each. Other varieties planted, such as "Hongjiao Zao," "Lei Huo Nian," "Xinzhu No. 8," "Chengqiu No. 5," "Changli Xian," "Guanxian Heigu," "Yuanzi No. 2," and "Aomori No. 5," were also varieties promoted by the state in recent years. In total, cultivation of excellent varieties accounted for 49 cases, or 83% of the 59 high-yield examples. Take Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, as an example. In 1957, the area planted with improved varieties such as "Nante No. 1," "Hongjiao Zao," and "Aomori No. 5" accounted for 54.8% of the early rice area, with an average yield of 709 jin per mu, an increase of 40.6% compared to the local early indica rice yield of 504 jin per mu. In 1958, under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, the area under improved seeds increased to 93% of the early rice area, with an average yield of 1,920 jin per mu, an increase of 90% compared to the local early indica rice yield of 1,011 jin per mu. Of the 330 high-yield early rice fields in the county, 80% were planted with "Nante No. 1," "Nante No. 16," "Youmang Zaojing," "Aomori No. 5," and "Zaojing No. 16."

    Henan Province is one of the provinces with the largest wheat area and highest yield in China. In 1958, the average wheat yield per mu leaped from 110 jin in 1957 to 232 jin. One of the reasons for the large-scale wheat harvest in Henan Province was the promotion of excellent varieties suitable for each region's different natural environment. In the southern Xinyang and Nanyang regions, most of the area was planted with improved varieties such as "Nanda 2419" and "Baiyupi." In the Kaifeng and Shangqiu regions, varieties such as "Bima No. 1" and "Xuzhou 438" were planted. In the Luoyang region, in addition to "Bima No. 1" and "No. 4," areas where wheat midges had occurred were planted with varieties such as "Xinong 6028" and "Nanda 2419" which are resistant to wheat midges. In the northern Henan region, most of the area was planted with "Bima No. 1," "Bima No. 4," "Pingyuan No. 5," and "Youzi Mai." All 34 examples of yields exceeding 2,000 jin per mu displayed at the Henan Provincial Agricultural Exhibition were planted with excellent varieties. In Meng County, the average wheat yield per mu in 1958 was 603 jin, the highest wheat yield per mu in Henan Province. All of the wheat was planted with improved varieties such as "Bima No. 1," "No. 4," "Pingyuan No. 5," and "Baiyupi." Promoting the "Daizi Cotton No. 15" improved variety, combined with improved cultivation techniques, has played a significant role in increasing cotton unit area yield and improving cotton fiber quality. Before the promotion of "Daizi Cotton" in Hubei Province in 1954, the average yield of seed cotton per mu in the province was about 27 jin. In 1955, the province began to promote "Daizi Cotton," accounting for 20% of the cotton area, and the average yield per mu increased to 32 jin. In 1956, it was planted in half of the area, and the average yield per mu was 44 jin. In 1957, it was fully popularized, and the unit area yield was 52 jin. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the average cotton yield per mu in the province exceeded 100 jin.

    In other crops, excellent varieties have also shown outstanding yield-increasing effects. The intervarietal hybrid corn varieties were expanded to over 4.2 million mu in 1958, six times more than in 1957, with yields increasing by 30%-50% compared to local varieties. For example, high yields of sweet potatoes such as "Shengli Baihao," "Huabei 117," "Huadong 51-93," and "Nanrui Tiao" were achieved everywhere. Most of the high-yield potato fields were planted with varieties such as "Wutai Bai," "Liwai Huang," and "292-20." One of the important reasons for the large-scale hemp harvest in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, in 1958, was the expanded planting of long-podded hemp varieties. The high-yield areas of the Yuzhouhong People's Commune in the county were planted with a type of long-podded hemp called "Qingpijia Ma." Other improved varieties such as "Di 154," "Xinxuan No. 1," and "Bailianzhi" also achieved high yields in various regions.

    The examples of high-yields of various crops have greatly shattered the conservative views of many people on the production capacity of varieties. Some people believe that the yield of ordinary wheat varieties of peasant families is at most 500 jin per mu, and the yield of generally promoted varieties is at most 700-800 jin. Ordinary rice varieties are not easy to exceed the 1,000 jin mark. However, many high-yield experimental fields in 1958 used these old varieties, and the yield per mu reached several thousand jin. For example, "Huoshaotou" in Jurong, Jiangsu, "Xiba Zao" in Chishui, Guizhou, "Nanyang Xian" in Xinghua, Jiangsu, and "Dali Gu" in Xinhui, Guangdong, all achieved yields of several thousand jin per mu, and these are all common peasant varieties. As for the promoted excellent varieties, the yield increase potential is even greater. The "Sansui Jin Da 2905" wheat king, cultivated by the Luoshuichong Farm in Anshun, Guizhou, exhibited at the National Agricultural Exhibition, had ears 6 inches long, with 25 spikelets per ear, each spikelet bearing 518 grains, and even the most basal spikelets bearing 314 grains, for a total of 160-166 grains of wheat per ear. These examples show that by further improving cultivation practices and improving the growth conditions of crops, the yield potential of our current crop varieties can be greatly increased, especially some high-yielding excellent varieties.

          Selecting and Breeding Improved Seeds

    Although the yield increase potential of existing varieties can still be greatly exploited, with the implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture", existing varieties are far from meeting the needs of production. First of all, some regions and some crops in China (especially crops with smaller cultivated areas) do not yet have improved seeds suitable for current cultivation needs. Under the current conditions of increasing fertilizer application and expanding irrigation areas, some varieties that are prone to lodging and diseases cannot fully utilize the favorable conditions after improving cultivation levels. In order to maximize the production capacity of these regions and these crops, it is necessary to rapidly select and breed their excellent varieties. Secondly, even if there have been some excellent varieties in the past, as the current production level increases, there is a demand for higher-yielding or better-quality improved seeds. Take Luqiao No. 1 Cooperative in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, as an example. As soil fertility has gradually improved, the main cultivated varieties have been continuously replaced. In 1952, the local "Zao Bai" was the main variety, accounting for 97.42% of the planted area. From 1953, "Zao Xian 503" gradually gained prominence, accounting for 85.06% of the rice area in 1955. However, after 1956, the more productive "Nante No. 1" gradually gained prominence, accounting for 57.05% of the total rice area in 1957. Since 1957, the cooperative has gradually used "Lucai No." and "Youmang Zaojing", which are more suitable for the current production level than "Nante No. 1." In order to adapt to the conditions of highly cultivated land in the future, China needs more high-yielding and high-quality varieties. Some varieties have large ears but small 1,000-grain weight, such as "Zhongnong No. 34", which produces more than one hundred grains per ear, but has a 1,000-grain weight of only about 24.5 grams. Some varieties have a large 1,000-grain weight, but do not produce many grains per ear. For example, the famous "Laolaiqing" has a 1,000-grain weight of 30-32 grams, but generally has fewer than 100 grains per ear (the largest only has more than 200 grains). According to current understanding, there are very few varieties that can produce 500,000 to 1,000,000 rice panicles per mu, with more than 200 grains per panicle, and a 1,000-grain weight of about 33-34 grams (15,000 grains per jin). In order to more fully exploit the role of good cultivation conditions and overcome the limitations of simply increasing the amount of sowing and the number of panicles per mu (which has a certain limit) to increase unit area yield, it is necessary to further breed varieties with high yield, good quality, and strong resistance. Thirdly, in some areas of China, the use of single improved varieties often affects production when encountering special natural disasters. Shaanxi Province learned from the past lesson of mainly promoting the single "Bima No. 1" wheat variety in the Guanzhong area. In 1958, Chang'an County mainly adopted a combination of five varieties, including "Xinong 6028", "Northwest Station No. 2", "Jingwei 26", "Hong Datou", and "Bima No. 1", for planting. This has four major benefits: 1. Land can be used appropriately according to soil quality and water conservancy conditions; 2. The yield-increasing potential of improved varieties can be fully exploited; 3. Labor can be adjusted to ensure that the grains are harvested; 4. The yield will not be particularly affected by severe disasters. In order to realize the combination and reasonable matching of improved varieties, more excellent varieties are also needed.

    The main source of improved varieties is China's original peasant varieties. Chinese laboring farmers have always attached importance to the selection and breeding of improved seeds. Therefore, China's peasant varieties are particularly abundant. In 1958, Guangdong Province selected 121 large-panicle high-yield rice varieties with more than 200 grains per panicle from peasant varieties. 70% of China's current promoted varieties are selected from peasant varieties. Since the Great Leap Forward, a large number of excellent varieties have emerged in high-yield fields across the country. Such as the "Shanxi Bai", "De Guo Hong", "Zigan Cao" and other wheat varieties in Henan Province, and the "Aiji Ye Dao", "Diao Sha Ji", "Lu Gan Bai" and other rice varieties in Jiangsu Province. The "Niumao Huang" and "Si Shang Yu" rice varieties are even more prominent. They were originally peasant varieties from Jiangsu. Because they require heavy fertilization, the rural areas were poor and the amount of fertilization was small under the previous reactionary rule, and the harvests were very poor. Farmers said, "If you plant Niumao Huang, people will starve," calling it "Pit Rice." After testing by agricultural scientific research institutions in Jiangxi, Hunan, and other places, due to the improvement of fertilization levels, the yield increase effect even exceeded that of famous excellent varieties. Now Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and other places are preparing to promote them. Due to the fundamental changes in agricultural production conditions, the production capacity of past varieties needs to be re-evaluated. As long as we break the superstition of foreign seeds and brand-name seeds, and carefully collect and study local varieties, all regions can find improved seeds suitable for local planting. This type of variety has been cultivated locally for a long time, adapts to the local environment, and is not prone to problems when promoted.

    Agricultural scientific research institutions have the important responsibility of selecting and identifying improved varieties, and have also selected many excellent varieties in the past. Further opposing conservatism, breaking the superstitious ideas of breeding routines and standardization, taking the mass line, and facing production can also speed up breeding work. The Xiong Yue Agricultural Science Research Institute in Liaoning Province implemented the policy of combining sorting, research, and utilization and promotion. Using small-plot observation and large-area yield measurement, intra-institute testing and regional identification, and a combination of testing and variety surveys, it identified the "Tielu Dao" improved rice variety from peasant seeds in two years, which is very popular among the masses. Currently, it has formed a situation in production where it is spreading spontaneously without being promoted.

    The most effective way to select and breed new varieties is to mobilize the masses to take action. In 1958, tens of thousands of commune members in various places were engaged in seed selection and breeding work. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 200 farmers who have achieved significant results in seed selection. Such as the "Bian Sui Xiao Mai" and "Dali Ban Mang" wheat in Shandong, and the "Quanjiao No. 1" in Anhui; such as the "Lao Lai Qing", "Huang Ke Zao Er Shi Ri" rice in Jiangsu, "Wuzui Nuo" in Zhejiang, and "Shui Yuan San Bai Li" in Hebei; such as the "Jing Shan Pu" soybean in Heilongjiang, and the "Da Mian Dou" in Henan; the "Fu Hua Sheng" peanut in Shandong, etc., were all selected and bred by contemporary farmer seed selectors. Yanshi in Henan, Huangyan in Zhejiang, and Nehe in Heilongjiang launched the movement of "Everyone Selects Seeds, Everyone Offers Seeds." Many people's communes require members to select several particularly good ears when rice and wheat are ripe, plant their seeds separately, and conduct comparative research. This work will blossom and bear fruit, and will certainly produce many new and excellent varieties. Many farmer seed selectors have adopted hybrid breeding methods. Some have even successfully used the more advanced asexual hybridization and distant hybridization breeding methods. The Wuxing No. 1 Cooperative in Changyuan County, Henan Province, has used the embryo grafting method to breed the Wuxing No. 1 new wheat variety. Jiang Shaofang in Guangxi used the dwarf sticky rice variety as the female parent and the curved-spike sorghum as the male parent to breed the "Yushi No. 1", which has shorter plants, large ears and dense grains, the "Yushi No. 2", which has taller plants, and the polyembryonic "Yushi No. 3." Zhou Hanhua in Guangdong crossed rice and sorghum to breed six new high-yield varieties. They all have the characteristics of thick stems, developed roots, strong resistance to diseases and lodging, long ears, many grains, and heavy grains. The best is the offspring of "Xingfu Nian," with ears more than 9 inches long, more than 300 grains per ear, and it still did not lodge when hit by an eighth-grade typhoon during the heading period, and it was also not susceptible to rice blast. This type of example points out a new way for us to cultivate new varieties. At the same time, it points out that many excellent breeders can emerge from the masses. According to the characteristics of China's vast land and complex environment, which require many excellent varieties, only by relying on the masses and widely carrying out seed selection and breeding work can we meet the objective requirements.

      Expanding the Scope of Improved Seed Utilization

    A variety is generated in a certain environment and has a certain adaptability. Transplanted to areas with very different environments and conditions, the yield may not be good. However, in the past, many people were deeply bound by bourgeois academic ideas and viewed the adaptability of varieties in a very narrow and mechanical way. There were so-called "Daizi Cotton cannot cross the Yellow River", "Northern Japonica will reduce yield when moved south", etc., which greatly limited the scope of improved seed utilization. These stale ideas and rigid rules have all been broken in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

    The Great Leap Forward has improved the level of agricultural production and created conditions suitable for the cultivation of excellent varieties, and the scope of utilization of excellent varieties has been expanded. When the "Aomori No. 5" improved rice variety was transferred from Jilin to Hubei and Hunan in 1956, some fields reduced production because the masses did not generally grasp its characteristics. In recent years, as people have gradually mastered the characteristics of northern Japonica after moving south, which is short, early-maturing, but still requires the same amount of fertilizer, and adopted measures of early planting, heavy fertilization, and close planting, the harvest has been very good. The "Ishikari Shiromao" in Heilongjiang has now become an extremely early-maturing double-cropping early rice variety in the Yangtze River Basin. "Yuanzi No. 2" in Jilin, and "Ningfeng" and "Weiguo" in Liaoning are all excellent rice varieties that can be suitable for planting in the Yangtze River Basin, and "Weiguo" can even be cultivated as double-cropping early rice in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and other places. "Daizi Cotton No. 15" has been basically popularized in Linqing in Shandong, Xinxiang in Henan, Handan in Hebei, Yuncheng in Shanxi and other regions. It generally increases production by more than 10% compared with the originally promoted "Sizi Cotton Erbi", "Wu'ai", "Da Sizi" and other varieties.

    Expanding the planting area of existing excellent varieties can solve the problem of insufficient types of excellent varieties in some areas. However, in order to enable the introduced excellent varieties to adapt to local conditions and achieve yield increase effects, it is necessary to go through a trial planting stage before large-scale planting to measure their adaptability. On the one hand, the state can plan to select a few representative ones to do a more detailed regional test, or the masses can cooperate with the masses to carry out multi-point simple variety comparison tests. In 1958, Jiangsu Province established 1,183 variety test points. In just one year, 453 varieties that could be promoted were identified from 4,551 varieties. Xinhui County in Guangdong introduced hundreds of Japonica rice varieties and scattered them in various agricultural cooperatives to carry out simple variety comparisons. In half a year, it identified 23 Japonica rice varieties with good quality, high yield, and suitable for cultivation in the county. Luqiao No. 1 Cooperative in Huangyan, Zhejiang, Bawang Cooperative in Suqian, Jiangsu, and Yuetan Cooperative in Yanshi, Henan, etc., have also launched this work within the commune. Experience proves that universally mobilizing the masses, carrying out simple variety comparison work in the commune, observing their advantages and disadvantages, and exploring the characteristics of the varieties, planting them according to local conditions, using their strengths and avoiding their weaknesses, so that all varieties can be used to their fullest potential. It is a faster, better, more economical way to quickly discover improved seeds, solve the rational layout and matching of improved seeds, and fully exploit the production potential of improved seeds.

          Improved Seed Propagation

    In many places, only certain improved seeds are promoted, and the propagation work is not paid attention to, so that some improved seeds are mixed and degenerate year by year. For example, the "Nante No. 1" improved rice variety in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan and other provinces is more prone to lodging, the grains are gradually sparse, the heading is not very neat, and the red rice is gradually increasing. Variety degeneration is an issue that needs attention in agricultural production.

    Doing a good job in propagation can guarantee and improve the superiority of improved seeds. Luqiao No. 1 Cooperative in Huangyan, Zhejiang, has always attached importance to seed work, selecting seeds and establishing seed fields year after year. The purity of all the commune's seeds is as high as 97%-99%. In 1956 and 1957, it became a thousand-jin commune. In addition to planting all improved seeds by itself, it also propagated a large number of improved seeds to supply to fraternal communes every year. In Xinhua County, Hunan Province, the masses mostly use the single-plant propagation method to carry out rice seed retention work, which uses a small amount of seeds, multiplies a large number of times, is easy to remove impurities and inferior plants, and further selects excellent varieties. The Dengjiabu Farm in Jiangxi adopted the method of single-plant selection, comparison by line, and mixed-line propagation to propagate the "Nante No. 1" improved rice variety and "Daizi Cotton". The variety purity of rice reached 99.8%, and "Daizi Cotton" also reached more than 95%. Experience has proved that combining seed selection and breeding, and doing a good job in improved seed propagation, even for crop varieties that are extremely prone to degeneration, can guarantee their superiority.

      Guaranteeing Seed Quality
    When selecting improved varieties, pay attention to the quality of the seeds, and check whether they are uniform, full, free from diseases and insect pests, and have strong germination power. According to research by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute using six wheat varieties including "Jin Da 2905" and "Jiangdong Men", large-grain seeds increased production by 2.7%-27.3% compared with small-grain seeds. According to the experiment by the Wenzhou Prefectural Farm in Zhejiang using "Nante No. 1" and "503" rice seeds, rice seeds with the removal of miscellaneous grains, diseased grains, shriveled grains, green grains, and barnyard grass increased production by 4.1%-8.4% compared with ordinary rice seeds, and the 1,000-grain weight was also improved.

    In the past, many agricultural cooperatives often caused production losses due to not paying enough attention to seed quality, resulting in missing seedlings and broken ridges, or weak and diseased seedlings. This is a lesson that should be remembered.

    In 1958, farmers in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Shandong and other provinces carried out seed quality inspection work. The methods used were: (1) When crops are mature, go to the fields to check the purity of the varieties, and combine this with removing diseased and inferior plants. (2) Check the moisture and impurities of the seeds before they are put into storage. (3) Check the germination ability before sowing. Many people's communes have made their own simple instruments such as samplers, dividers, balances, and constant temperature germination boxes to solve the problem of insufficient seed inspection tools.

            People's Communes

    To Comprehensively Do a Good Job in Seed Work

    The people's communes have created favorable conditions for comprehensively carrying out seed work. Communes have more arable land, more crop varieties, and a large demand for seeds. Under this situation, if the seed work is not done well, it is easy to cause insufficient seed quantity and poor quality, which will affect production. In response to this situation, some people's communes have established a more systematic organizational structure and comprehensively carried out seed work. Judging from the current situation, this practice is necessary and feasible.

    Before the summer harvest in 1958, Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, launched a seed revolution, retaining seeds on 100,000 mu and selecting seeds weighing 40 million jin, basically achieving "Whatever is planted, there is; however much is needed, there is; however good it needs to be, it is good." And organizations for seed work were established in various communes. After the people's communes, it was further developed to the following scale: The commune established an improved seed breeding and experimental farm (with a seed research office, variety experimental farm, and improved seed propagation farm), established an improved seed demonstration propagation area in the farm, and each production brigade established an improved seed professional production team to further propagate the seeds needed by the brigade. The commune established a seed inspection room, each farm established an inspection team, and the production brigade established inspectors. The commune established a storage section, and the farms and teams established storekeepers, and separate seed warehouses were established. Basically, the seed work management system has been implemented.

    People's communes establish systematic seed work organizations, self-propagate, self-select, self-retain, and self-use improved seeds, which can enable agricultural production to reach a higher level.

    良种
    农业部种子管理局
    1958年，我国良种的栽培面积扩大了五亿七千万亩，相当于第一个五年计划期间良种推广总面积的一半以上，在增产上起了比较显著的作用。
          良种增产
    优良品种由于茎秆粗壮，耐肥喜水，不易倒伏，对于某些病虫害和自然灾害的抵抗力强（很多品种在多肥多水的条件下很容易倒伏或发生病虫害），可以充分利用提高栽培水平的有利条件，得到增产。稻麦等作物的优良品种，分蘖整齐适中，穗大，粒多，粒大；棉花优良品种果枝多，铃多铃大；大豆优良品种结荚多，每荚粒多、粒大，增产很显著。
    1958年11月全国水稻会议搜集到的以早中稻为主的五十九个水稻高额丰产的事例中，籼稻中种南特号水稻良种的是十一处，种南特16号的三处，种胜利籼的五处，种中农4号的二处，种华南15号的三处，粳稻中种有芒早粳和银坊的各四处，种黄壳早二十日的三处，种农林16号、“10509”和老来青的各二处，其余种的如红脚早、雷火粘、新竹8号、澄秋5号、长粒籼、灌县黑谷子、元子2号和青森5号等也都是国家几年来推广的品种。以上栽培优良品种的共计四十九处，占五十九个高产事例中的83％。以湖北省孝感县为例。1957年推广南特号、红脚早、青森5号等良种面积占早稻面积54.8％，平均亩产七百零九斤。比本地早籼稻亩产五百零四斤增产40.6％。1958年在跃进的新形势下，良种面积发展到早稻面积的93％，平均每亩产一千九百二十斤，比本地早籼稻亩产一千零十一斤增产90％。全县三百三十块早稻丰产田，80％种的是南特号、南特16号、有芒早粳、青森5号和早粳16号。
    河南省是我国小麦面积最大产量最高的一个省。1958年小麦每亩平均产量由1957年的一百一十斤跃进到二百三十二斤。河南省大面积小麦丰收的原因之一，是根据全省各个地区不同的自然环境，分别推广了适于各该地区的优良品种。在南部的信阳、南阳专区，大部分种植了南大2419和白玉皮等良种，在开封、商丘专区等种植碧蚂1号和徐州438等，在洛阳专区除种碧蚂1号和4号外，在发生过吸浆虫地区还种植了西农6028和南大2419等抗吸浆虫的品种，在豫北地区则大部分种植碧蚂1号、碧蚂4号、平原50和蚰子麦。河南省农业展览会展出的亩产二千斤以上的三十四个事例中，全部种的是优良品种。孟县1958年小麦平均亩产六百零三斤，是河南省小麦亩产量最高的一县，全部种的是碧蚂1号、4号、平原50和白玉皮等小麦良种。推广岱字棉15号良种，结合改进栽培技术对于提高棉花单位面积产量，改进棉纤维质量，起了显著作用。湖北省1954年未推广岱字棉时，全省平均每亩产皮棉二十七斤左右。1955年开始推广岱字棉，占棉田面积20％，每亩平均产量提高为三十二斤。1956年种到一半面积，每亩产量平均四十四斤。1957年全面普及，单位面积产量五十二斤。1958年大跃进后，全省棉花每亩平均产量超出一百斤。
    在其他作物中，优良品种也都表现了突出的增产作用。玉米品种间杂交种，1958年扩大种植到四百二十多万亩，比1957年翻了六番，产量比当地品种增加30％—50％。如甘薯中的胜利百号、华北117、华东51—93、南瑞苕，到处得到丰产。马铃薯的高额丰产地种的大多是五台白、里外黄、292—20等品种。浙江省萧山县1958年黄麻大面积丰收的重要原因之一是扩大种植了长果种黄麻。该县宇宙红人民公社高额丰产地种的就是长果种中的一种——青皮荚麻，其他如地154、新选1号、白莲芝等良种都在各地得到丰产。
    各种农作物高额丰产的事例，大大地打破了许多人对品种生产能力的保守观点。有些人认为一般小麦农家品种亩产至多不过五百斤，一般推广的品种至多也不过七八百斤。一般水稻品种不容易超过千斤关。但，1958年许多高产试验田就是采用的这些老品种，而每亩都有产到几千斤的。小麦中如江苏句容的火烧头，水稻中如贵州赤水的西坝早、江苏兴化的南洋籼、广东新会的大粒谷每亩产量都有达到几千斤的，而这些都是一般的农家种。至于推广的优良品种，增产潜力更大。全国农业展览会中展出的贵州安顺落水冲农场培育的三穗金大2905小麦王，穗长6寸，每穗有二十五个小穗，每小穗结实五一八粒，最基部的小穗也结实三一四粒，全穗结麦粒一百六十—一百六十六。这些事例说明进一步做好栽培工作，改善作物的生长条件，我国目前的农作物品种，还可大大发挥增产潜力，特别是一些丰产型的优良品种。
          选育良种
    尽管现有品种的增产潜力还可大大发挥，但随着“八字宪法”的贯彻，现有品种还远不能适应生产上的需要。首先，我国有些地方和有些作物（特别是栽培面积较小的作物）还没有适应于现在耕作需要的良种。在目前提高施肥水平，扩大灌溉面积的情况下，一些容易引起倒伏，发生病害的品种，已不能充分利用提高耕作水平后的有利条件。为了发挥这些地区和这些作物的生产能力，必须迅速选育它们的优良品种。其次，即使已经有过去的一些优良品种，但随着现在生产水平的提高，要求有产量更高或质量更好的良种。以浙江省黄岩县的路桥一社为例，随着土壤肥力的逐年提高，主要的栽培品种亦随着不断的进行更换。1952年以当地种早白为主，占种植面积的97.42％，1953年起早籼503逐年占上风，1955年种到水稻面积的85.06％。但1956年以后更丰产的南特号又逐渐占上风，1957年南特号占水稻总面积的57.05％。1957年以来，该社又逐步用比南特号更适于现在生产水平的陆财号和有芒早粳。为了适于今后高度耕作水平的条件，我国今后需要更丰产的优良品种。有些品种虽然穗大但千粒重小，如中农34号每穗多结实一百几十粒，但千粒重只有二十四点五克左右。有些品种千粒重虽大，但每穗所结的粒数不多，如著名的老来青千粒重虽有三十—三十二克，但一般每穗不到一百粒（最大的也只有二百多粒）。据目前的了解，每亩能出稻穗五十—一百万穗，每穗结实二百粒以上，千粒重在三十三—三十四克左右（每斤一万五千粒）的品种就很少。为了更充分发挥良好的耕作条件的作用，并克服单纯从增加播种量和每亩穗数（有一定限度）方面来提高单位面积产量，必须进一步培育产量高、质量好、抗逆性强的品种。第三，我国目前有些地方由于采用良种单一化，遇到特殊的自然灾害，往往影响生产。陕西省接受了关中地区以往主要推广碧蚂1号小麦品种单一化的教训，1958年长安县主要采用了西农6028，西北站2号，泾渭26号，红大头和碧蚂1号等五个品种为一个组合，搭配种植。这样做有四大好处：一、可以根据土质和水利条件适当利用土地；二、可以充分发挥良种的增产潜力；三、可以调剂劳力，保证颗粒还家；四、不会因严重灾害而特殊影响产量。为了实现良种组合，合理搭配，也需要更多的优良品种。
    优良品种的主要来源是我国原有的农家品种。我国劳动农民一贯重视选育良种的工作，因此我国的农家品种特别丰富。广东省1958年在农家品种中已经挑选出一百二十一个每穗在二百粒以上的水稻大穗丰产品种。我国现在的推广品种中，70％就是由农家品种中选拔出来的。大跃进以来各地的高产田出现了大量优良品种。如河南省的山西白、德国红、紫秆糙等小麦品种，江苏省的矮箕野稻、吊煞鸡、芦秆白等水稻品种即是。牛毛黄和四上裕两个水稻品种更为突出。它们原是江苏的农家品种，由于它需要重肥，在以往反动统治下，农村贫苦，施肥量少，收成很不好。农民说“种了牛毛黄，人要饿断肠”，称它为“坑稻”。这两个品种经过江西、湖南等地农业科学研究机关的试验，由于施肥水平的提高，增产效果甚至超过著名的优良品种。现在江西湖北湖南等地都在准备推广。由于农业生产条件有基本的改变，对于以往品种的生产能力需要从新鉴定。只要打破迷信外地种和名牌种的思想，认真搜集研究当地品种，各地都可以找到适于当地种植的良种。这种品种在当地栽培已久，适应当地环境，推广时不容易出毛病。
    农业科学研究机关负有选育和鉴定优良品种的重责，以往也选出了不少优良品种。进一步反对保守，破除育种常规和标准化的迷信思想，走群众路线，面向生产，还能加快育种工作速度。辽宁省熊岳农业科学研究所贯彻了边整理、边研究、边利用推广的方针，用小区观察与大区产量测定，所内试验与区域鉴定，试验和品种调查相结合的方法，两年来从农家种中鉴定了“铁路稻”水稻良种，很受群众欢迎，目前在生产上已经形成一个不推自广的局面。
    选育新品种最有效的办法是发动群众大家动手。1958年各地人民公社有成千上万的社员在进行选种育种工作。据不完全统计，已获得显著成绩的农民选种家就有二百多人。小麦中如山东的扁穗小麦和大粒半芒、安徽的全椒一号；水稻中如江苏的老来青，黄壳早二十日，浙江的乌嘴糯，河北的水原三百粒；大豆中如黑龙江的荆山璞，河南的大面豆；山东的伏花生等等都是当代农民选种家选育出来的。河南偃师、浙江黄岩、黑龙江讷河发动“人人选种、人人献种”运动。不少人民公社要求社员在稻麦成熟时，选出若干个特别好的穗，把它们的种子分别种植，进行比较研究。这一工作开花结果，一定可以产生很多新的优良品种。不少农民选种家采用了杂交育种法。有的还采用了比较高级的无性杂交和远缘杂交育种成功。河南省长垣县五星一社已用胚接法育成五星一号小麦新品种。广西蒋少芳用矮子粘稻种作母本，曲穗高粱作父本，育成植株较矮，穗大粒密的玉师一号，植株高大的玉师二号和多胚性的玉师三号。广东周汉华用水稻和高粱杂交，培育成了六个高额丰产的新品种。它们都有茎干粗壮，根系发达，抗病害和抗倒伏力强，穗长，粒多，粒重的特点。最好的是幸福粘的后代，穗长九寸多，每穗三百多粒，抽穗时受到八级台风袭击仍不倒伏，还不易感染稻热病。这类事例为我们培育新品种指出了一条新的途径。同时指出：群众中可以产生很多优秀的育种家。根据我国地面广大，环境复杂，需要优良品种多的特点，也只有依靠群众，广泛展开选种育种工作，才能适应客观要求。
      扩大良种利用范围
    一个品种在一定的环境下生成，有一定的适应性。移植到环境、条件相差较远较大的地区，产量就不一定好。但以往不少人由于深受资产阶级学术思想的束缚，对于品种的适应性看得很狭隘、机械。有所谓岱字棉不能北过黄河，北粳南移要减产等等说法，大大限制了良种的利用范围。这些陈腐的思想和清规戒律，在农业生产大跃进中都被一一冲破了。
    大跃进提高了农业生产的水平，创造了适于优良品种栽培的条件，优良品种的利用范围扩大了。青森五号水稻良种，1956年由吉林调到湖北湖南栽种时，由于群众没有普遍掌握它的特性，部分田地因而减产。近年由于逐步掌握了北粳南移后植株矮小、早熟但需肥量仍不变的特性，采用早种、多肥、密植的措施，收成很好。黑龙江的石狩白毛现已成为长江流域一个极早熟的双季早稻良种。吉林的元子二号，辽宁的宁丰、卫国，都是可以适于长江流域栽种的优良稻种，卫国甚至还可在广东广西福建等地作双季早稻栽培。岱字棉15号在山东临清、河南新乡、河北邯郸、山西运城等地区已基本普及，一般比原来推广的斯字棉二比、五爱、大斯等品种增产10％以上。
    扩大现有优良品种的栽种地区，可以解决在某些地区优良品种种类不足的问题。但为了使引进的优良品种能够适应本地条件，取得增产效果，在大面积种植以前一定要经过试验试种阶段，测定它们的适应性。这一方面可由国家有计划地择少数有代表性的做比较细致的区
  域试验，也可由群众或同群众合作展开多点的
  简单的品种对比试验。江苏省1958年建立了一千一百八十三个品种试验点，只用一年时间，从四千五百五十一个品种中，鉴定出可以推广的四百五十三个品种。广东新会县引进几百个粳稻品种，分散在各农业社进行简单的品种对比，半年中就确定了二十三个品质好、产量高适于该县栽培的粳稻品种。浙江黄岩的路桥一社，江苏宿迁的霸王社，河南偃师的岳滩社等等，也都已在社内展开了这一工作。经验证
  明，普遍发动群众，在社里展开简单的品种对比工作，观察它们的好坏，同时摸索品种的特性，因地种植，用其所长，避其所短，使一切品种各得其所，是迅速发掘良种，解决良种合理布局和搭配，充分发挥良种生产潜力的多快好省的办法。
          良种繁殖
    很多地方由于只推广某些良种，没有重视做好繁殖工作，以致有些良种逐年混杂退化。如南特号水稻良种在安徽、江西、湖南等省已比较容易倒伏，谷粒渐渐稀疏，抽穗不很整齐，红米逐渐增多。品种退化是农业生产上一个需要注意的问题。
    做好繁殖工作，可以保证和提高良种的优越性。浙江黄岩路桥一社一贯重视种子工作，连年选种并建立种子田。全社种子纯度高达97％—99％。1956、1957年就成为千斤社，除自己全部种植良种外，每年还繁殖大量良种供给兄弟社。湖南省新化县群众多用单本繁殖法进行水稻留种工作，用种量少，繁殖的倍数大，容易去杂去劣，进一步选出优异的品种。江西邓家埠农场采用单株选择，分系比较，混系繁殖的办法繁育南特号水稻良种和岱字棉，品种纯度水稻达99.8％，岱字棉亦在95％以上。经验证明，把选种和培育结合起来，做好良种繁殖工作，即使是极易退化的作物品种，也可以保证其优越性。
      保证种子质量选用优良品种，须注意种子的质量，检验其是否均匀饱满，无病虫害，发芽力强。据华东农业科学研究所用金大2905、江东门等六个小麦品种的研究，大粒种子比小粒种子增产2.7％—27.3％。据浙江温州专署农场用南特号和503稻种的试验，除去杂谷、病谷、瘪谷、青谷、稗子的稻种比一般稻种增产4.1％—8.4％，千粒重也有所提高。
    以往不少农业社由于没有十分注意种子的质量常常造成缺苗断垅或者禾苗瘦弱多病，使生产受到损失，这是应该记取的教训。
    1958年，辽宁、黑龙江、山西、山东等省农民进行了种子质量的检验工作。所用的方法是：（1）在庄稼成熟时，到田间检验品种的纯度，结合着拔除病株劣株。（2）在入库以前检验种子的水分和杂质。（3）播种前检验发芽能力。许多人民公社都自制了扦样器、分样板、天秤、恒温发芽箱等简单仪器解决了种子检验工具不足的问题。
            人民公社
    要全面做好种子工作
    人民公社为全面开展种子工作创造了有利的条件。公社耕地面积多，作物品种多，需要种子量大。在这种情况下，如果不做好种子工作，易使种子数量不足，质量低劣，影响生产。针对这一情况，有些人民公社建立了比较系统的组织机构，全面开展了种子工作。从目前情况看，这种做法是必要的，也是可行的。
    1958年夏收前，山西省长治市大闹种子革命，留种十万亩，选种四千万斤，基本达到“种什么，有什么，要多少有多少，要多好有多好”。并且在各社成立了种子工作的组织。人民公社化后，更进一步发展到下列规模：公社成立良种繁育试验场（下设种子研究室，品种试验场，良种繁殖场），场内建立良种示范繁殖区，生产大队各设良种专业生产组，进一步繁殖本大队所需的种子。公社建立种子检验室，各农场建立检验组，生产大队设检验员。公社设立保管股，场队设立保管员，分别建立种子库。基本上实现了种子工作管理制度化。
    人民公社建立系统的种子工作组织，自繁自选自留自用良种，可以使农业生产达到更高的水平。
