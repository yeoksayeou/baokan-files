Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 4th: The prelude to Inner Mongolia's desert control work has begun. More than 500 scientific and technical personnel participating in the desert control work have recently arrived in succession at Sanshenggong Town (i.e., Dingkou), the base point for transforming the desert in Inner Mongolia, and have successively entered the nearby Ulan Buh Desert to carry out work.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences Desert Control Team, with the participation of many scientists, professors, researchers, engineers, and university students, has established a comprehensive desert control experimental station in Sanshenggong, and has selected a 120-square-kilometer desert in the Ulan Buh Desert as an experimental field. This year, the experimental area of the experimental station is 150,000 mu of desert, and they plan to study thirteen scientific projects in this area. The scientific and technical personnel will also cooperate with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in carrying out aerial seeding and artificial rainfall experiments on 1.5 million mu of desert. The two desert survey teams of the Desert Control Team will enter the Badain Jaran, Kubuqi, and Xiao Tengger Deserts in late April respectively.

The First Detachment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Desert Control Afforestation Comprehensive Survey and Design Team also arrived in Sanshenggong at the end of March and entered the Ulan Buh Desert. This detachment has more than 270 scientific and technical personnel and desert control technical workers. They are to complete the survey and design of 1.4 million hectares of the Ulan Buh Desert within the year, and submit specific management plans to the relevant departments of the Autonomous Region. They are now concentrating on practicing operations in the desert, and are about to set off and advance into the hinterland of the Ulan Buh Desert.

Fifty-eight graduates of the Inner Mongolia Forestry College also recently came to Sanshenggong, preparing to be assigned to rural areas in the sandy areas to help the people's communes in the sandy areas train 100,000 forestry cadres in a short period of time. Sanshenggong Town in Bayannur League is bordered by the Ulan Buh Desert to the north, the Kubuqi Desert to the south, and close to the Badain Jaran Desert and the Tengger Desert to the west and southwest. It is the base point for transforming the desert in Inner Mongolia, and a large number of personnel participating in desert control work will gather and disperse here. Recently, because the desert control work is about to begin, camel teams carrying desert control personnel and supplies arrive from time to time, and the streets are becoming increasingly lively.

    探索沙漠秘密　开辟治沙道路
    大批科学技术人员进入内蒙古沙漠
    新华社呼和浩特4日电　内蒙古治沙工作的序幕已经揭开。参加治沙工作的五百多名科学技术人员，最近先后到达内蒙古改造沙漠的基点——三盛公镇（即矴口），并已陆续进入附近的乌兰布和沙漠进行工作。
    有许多科学家、教授、研究员、工程师和大学生参加的中国科学院治沙队，在三盛公设下一个治沙综合试验站，并在乌兰布和沙漠上选择了一块一百二十平方公里的沙漠，作为试验场。今年，试验站的试验面积是十五万亩沙漠，他们计划在这个面积上研究十三个科学项目。科学技术人员们还将配合内蒙古自治区在一百五十万亩沙漠上进行飞机播种和人工降雨试验等工作。治沙队的两支沙漠考察队，将在4月下旬分别进入巴丹吉林、库布齐和小腾格尔沙漠。
    内蒙古自治区治沙造林综合勘察设计大队第一分队，也在3月末到达三盛公，进入乌兰布和沙漠。这个分队共有科学技术人员和治沙技术工人二百七十多名。他们要在年内将一百四十万公顷的乌兰布和沙漠勘察设计完毕，向自治区有关部门提出具体的治理方案。现在他们正在沙漠里集中练习操作，马上就要出发，向乌兰布和沙漠腹地前进。
    内蒙古林学院的五十八名毕业生，也在最近来到三盛公，准备下放到沙区农村，帮助沙区农村人民公社在短期内培训出十万名林业干部。巴彦淖尔盟的三盛公镇北边是乌兰布和沙漠，南边和库布齐沙漠接壤，西边和西南靠近巴丹吉林沙漠和腾格里大沙漠，是内蒙古改造沙漠的基点，参加治沙工作的大批人员都要在这里集散。近来，因为治沙工作即将开始，不时有驮载治沙人员和物资的骆驼队到达，街道上日益热闹起来。
