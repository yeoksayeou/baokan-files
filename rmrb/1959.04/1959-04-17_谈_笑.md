　　Talking About "Laughter"
　　Fu Lianzhang
　　Laughter—is a manifestation of mental pleasure, a complex reflex brought about by some stimulus that causes laughter. This reflex reaction includes the sound of laughter and the activity of muscles in many parts of the body, first and foremost the excitement of the facial muscles resulting in a "smiling face"; even to the point of "waving hands and dancing feet," "laughing uncontrollably," and "holding one's belly and laughing," almost all the muscles of the body are activated.

　　The reflex of laughter is also mainly a conditioned reflex, meaning that the factors that trigger laughter are primarily a neural connection established through acquired life experiences. Newborn infants are very unlikely to laugh.

　　Therefore, the stimuli that can evoke laughter may be universally shared, such as watching a clown's performance in a theater. As long as one is not "absent-minded," it will affect everyone and cause "roars of laughter." However, the factors that trigger laughter often vary from person to person in many situations. The exploiting classes consider indulgence in extravagance and shameless immorality as delightful and laughable, while the laboring people see it as shameful and causing angry reactions. For example, our people regard the establishment of the people's commune movement as a rising sun and are infinitely encouraged, with ten thousand families rejoicing, but in the eyes of the Dulles clique, they foresee the approaching doomsday and are filled with sorrow. The sounds of victory and laughter from the people of socialist countries are like sharp arrows piercing the hearts of imperialist warmongers.

　　Some people ask whether laughter is good for health. Is the saying, "A laugh a day keeps the doctor away," true?

　　My answer is: laughter is good for health, but it cannot be generalized.

　　After tense labor, everyone enjoys some entertainment and laughs for a while. A new center of excitation appears in the cerebral cortex, allowing the cortical areas excited by tense labor to rest; this helps to recover from fatigue and improve health.

　　Laughter is a reflection of pleasure. Rather than saying that laughter helps health, it is more appropriate to say that mental pleasure is very beneficial to health. Mental pleasure can keep the mind clear when working, preventing forgetfulness; it can increase appetite, preventing sorrow and difficulty in swallowing; it can ensure peaceful sleep, preventing tossing and turning, and many dreams; pleasure benefits the sick, aiding recovery; pleasure rejuvenates the elderly, adding to their energy; these are all benefits.

　　It is not easy for a person to maintain long-lasting pleasant emotions; one must have a revolutionary optimistic ideology. People with this kind of ideology, even in difficult times, do not frown and become dejected, but have the confidence to overcome difficulties and see an optimistic future. Chairman Mao's poem describing the scene of crossing the snowy mountains during the Long March: "More delighted still are the snow-clad Min Mountains, After the three armies have passed, faces break into smiles." Instead of describing how difficult and terrible the snowy mountains were, this is a portrayal of the great revolutionary spirit of optimism. Individualists cannot be happy for long; only at the moment when their individualistic demands are met do they have a complacent smile, but individualistic desires are insatiable and soon turn into the frustration of dissatisfaction. Therefore, for individualists, brief laughter does not benefit the body, while long-term depression certainly harms physical and mental health.

　　In two situations, laughter should be restrained:

　　It is not good to laugh loudly during work (mainly referring to mental labor). As the saying goes, "Pleasure makes one forget worries," but pleasure can not only make one forget worries but also forget work. This is also the principle of one part of the cerebral cortex being excited while inducing inhibition in other parts. Therefore, talking and laughing during work may cause errors in the work or reduce efficiency.

　　Do not laugh loudly during meals either. Because during normal swallowing, the epiglottis can reflexively cover the opening of the larynx, allowing food to enter the esophagus correctly; but when laughing loudly, this covering reflex is temporarily insensitive, and food may fall into the trachea. In this case, if a new, rapid cough reflex occurs to protectively cough out the food, there is no major problem; this is the so-called "laughing until one spits out food." If this "food" cannot be "spit" out, there will be bad consequences. Of course, these can be avoided with attention and do not diminish the beneficial effects of laughter and mental pleasure on people.

　　A friend from a capitalist country once told me, "The Chinese are always smiling." I told him, "This is because our people are liberated, have become masters, and are working to build their own happy lives, so they are happy." Laughter can be heard everywhere and can be said to be a common characteristic of the people of socialist countries.

　　With the continuous victories of our socialist construction, people will laugh more and more, and laugh better and better; in the laughter, one difficulty after another in work will be overcome; in the laughter, there will be leap after leap; in the laughter, the lives of our people will become better and better day by day, and their bodies will become healthier.

### 谈“笑”

　　谈“笑”
　　傅连暲
    笑——是一种精神愉快的表征，它是由于引起发笑的某种刺激而招致的一种复杂的反射。这种反射反应，包括有笑的声音，和很多部位的肌肉活动，首先是面部肌肉的兴奋而“笑容可掬”；甚者，“手之舞之”“足之蹈之”“笑不可仰”“捧腹大笑”，几乎全身的肌肉都活动了起来。
    笑的反射，又主要是一种条件反射，就是说引起发笑的因素，主要是后天生活经历中建立起来的一种神经联系，初生婴儿是很少可能发笑的。
    因此能引起人发笑的刺激，可以是大家一致的，如看了剧团小丑的表演，只要不是“心不在焉”，就会对每个人发生作用，而引起“哄堂大笑”。但是引起发笑的因素，在很多场合则是因人而异的。剥削阶级以纸醉金迷荒淫无耻为可喜可笑，而在劳动人民眼中则认为可耻和引起愤怒的反应。又如我国人民把建立人民公社运动当作初升的太阳而无限鼓舞，万家欢笑，但在杜勒斯之流看来，则预感到末日将临不胜哀怨。社会主义国家人民一声声胜利的笑声，就是帝国主义战争贩子一支支钻心的利箭。
    有人问笑对于健康有没有好处？俗语说：“笑一笑，少一少”，是对的么？
    我的回答是：笑对健康有好处，但也不能一概而论。
    紧张劳动之余，大家娱乐一番，笑上一阵，大脑皮层里出现一个新的兴奋灶，而使由紧张劳动所引起兴奋的皮层区域得到休息；这就有助于恢复疲劳，增进健康。
    笑是愉快的一种反映，与其说笑有助于健康，无宁说精神愉快对健康大有好处，更为妥当。精神愉快，可以使工作时头脑清醒，不至是抓东忘西；可以增进食欲，不至是愁肠满腹，难以下咽；可以使睡眠安稳，不至是辗转反侧，夜长梦多；病者愉快，有利于康复；老者愉快，则精力有加；这些都是好处。
    一个人持有长时的愉快情绪是不容易的，非具有革命的乐观主义思想不可，具有这种思想的人，即使在困难的时刻，也不是愁眉苦脸，垂头丧气，而是有克服困难的信心，看到了乐观的前途。毛主席咏长征过雪山的情景的诗句：“更喜岷山千里雪，三军过后尽开颜。”而不是描写雪山如何艰苦可怕，这就是伟大的革命乐观主义精神的一个写照。个人主义者是不能长时愉快的，只有偶尔满足了他个人主义要求的一刹那才有得意的笑容，但是个人主义欲壑难填，很快又要转入到不满足的苦闷之中，因此对于个人主义者说来，短暂的欢笑无补于身体，而长时的苦闷确有损于身心健康。
    在两种场合下，笑应该有所节制：
    当工作进行之中（主要指脑力劳动的工作），大事喧笑是不好的。俗话说：“乐以忘忧”，乐不仅可以忘忧，而且可以忘工作。这也就是大脑皮层一部分兴奋，而诱导另一些部分抑制的道理。因此在工作中谈笑，就可能使工作发生差错，或者效率减低。
    进餐中也不要大笑。因为正常吞咽时，会厌部能反射地掩住喉口，食物可以正确无误的进入食道；而大笑时这种掩盖的反射一时不敏，食物就有可能坠入气管，在这当儿，如果幸好来一个新的急剧咳嗽的保护性反射，把食物咳出来，也无大碍，这就是所谓的“令人喷饭”；如果这个“饭”“喷”不出来，就会发生不好的后果。当然这些只需加以注意就可以避免，并不使笑和精神愉快对人有益的意义减色。
    有一位来自资本主义国家的朋友曾向我说：“中国人都是笑嘻嘻的。”我告诉他：“这是由于我们的人民解放了，作了主人，为建设自己的幸福生活而劳动，所以是愉快的。”笑声随处可闻，可以说是社会主义国家人民的普遍特点。
    随着我们社会主义建设的节节胜利，人们将笑得越来越多，笑得越来越好；在笑声里，工作中一个个的困难将被克服；在笑声里，从一个跃进又到一个更大的跃进；在笑声里，我国人民一天天生活得更美好，身体更加健康。
