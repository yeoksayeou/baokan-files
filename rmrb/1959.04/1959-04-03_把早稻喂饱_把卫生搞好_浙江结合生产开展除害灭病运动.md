Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 2nd. Zhejiang is currently combining spring plowing and production with a spring pest elimination and disease prevention campaign.

    The masses in the suburbs of Ningbo City, under the slogan "Feed the early rice well, improve sanitation," are seizing the opportunity to combine manure accumulation with beautifying, greening, and perfuming the environment to eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. Hangzhou City has paid special attention to improving environmental sanitation this year. More than two thousand people were mobilized to spend five days dredging the previously difficult-to-manage Huansha River and Zhonghe River, digging up river mud, cleaning riverbeds, and filling gaps in the riverbank walls. This made the Huansha River, which runs through the urban area, flow smoothly and take on a new look, and accumulated 160,000 dan of river mud fertilizer. Residents along the river also renovated many sewer outlets, manholes, seepage pits, and ditches in conjunction with dredging the river. People's communes in various counties in Jiaxing, Ningbo, Wenzhou and other regions have all set up sanitation "experimental fields" and held on-site meetings to promote pest elimination and disease prevention experiences. Pig and cattle pens in counties such as Yuhuan, Zhuji, Linhai, and Jiaxing have been sorted out in sections, and public toilets have been built.

    During the campaign, various localities have been grasping the work of eliminating diseases. The Chinese and Western medicine practitioners at the Xieqiao Commune Central Hospital in Haining County are working closely together to carry out a comprehensive prevention and control campaign to eliminate schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, ascariasis, and whipworm disease. Wenxi People's Commune in Wenling County conducted investigations centered on canteens and construction sites, and immediately treated patients found to have parasitic diseases. After five days and nights of hard work, they have treated more than 90% of hookworm patients. Currently, they have begun to focus on treating filariasis, malaria, and other diseases.

    People's communes in Zhuji County and other places have also vigorously trained health workers, midwives, cooks, childcare workers, and sanitation workers in conjunction with the spring pest elimination and disease prevention campaign. At present, the province has trained 120,000 of these five types of personnel.

    把早稻喂饱　把卫生搞好
    浙江结合生产开展除害灭病运动
    新华社杭州2日电　浙江各地正在结合春耕生产开展春季除害灭病运动。
    宁波市郊区群众在“把早稻喂饱，将卫生搞好”的口号下，正抓紧时机结合积肥和美化、绿化、香化环境，铲除蚊、蝇孳生的巢穴。杭州市今年特别注意了搞好环境卫生。曾出动了二千多人，以五天的时间，对过去被认为难以治理的浣纱河和中河，进行了挖河泥、洗河床和嵌河岸壁缝等，使贯通上城市区的浣纱河河水流畅，面貌一新，并且积河泥肥十六万担。沿岸市民们还结合修浚河道改造了不少下水道口、窨井、渗水坑和水沟等。嘉兴、宁波、温州等专区各县人民公社，都搞了卫生“试验田”，并分别召开了现场会议，推广除害灭病经验。玉环、诸暨、临海、嘉兴等县的猪、牛栏已经分片整理，并且对公共厕所进行了修建。
    在运动中，各地抓紧进行了灭病工作，海宁县斜桥公社中心医院中西医密切配合，正在开展一个全面消灭血吸虫病、钩虫病、血丝虫病、蛔虫病和鞭虫病的防治活动。温岭县温西人民公社以食堂和工地为中心进行调查，发现患寄生虫病的病人就立即治疗。经过他们奋战五昼夜，已治疗了90％以上的钩虫病人，目前，他们又开始集中治疗丝虫和疟疾等疾病。
    诸暨县等地人民公社还结合春季除害灭病大力培训保健员、接生员、炊事员、保育员和清洁卫生员，目前全省培训的五员有十二万人。
