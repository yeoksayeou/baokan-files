More than 800,000 farmers in the region have been投入 into the high tide of spring production. Everywhere, secretaries are taking the lead, assigning responsibilities at each level, strengthening leadership, and adopting the method of inspecting, sowing, and accepting simultaneously to ensure the quality of spring planting.

This year, the southeastern Shanxi area plans to sow more than 6.1 million mu of various autumn crops.

Deep plowing accounted for 78% of the total autumn land, of which nearly one million mu of land was deep plowed to a depth of two to three chi. The average amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu of autumn land was more than 26,000 jin, and about three-quarters of the fertilizer has been delivered to the fields. Preliminary garden-style cultivation has been implemented on more than 400,000 mu of land. 930,000 new tools of various types have been manufactured, and 610,000 have been repaired. Seeds have generally been sun-dried once to three times. Various localities have also trained a large number of seeding technicians. (Attached picture)

    山西
    新华社太原4日电　晋东南太行山区风和日暖，春耕播种已进入繁忙季节。今年春播工作普遍比往年提早了十天到半个月左右。在3月30日就下种了大麻、谷类、山药蛋、春麦、棉花、蔬菜等七万六千多亩。
    为了保证春耕播种顺利进行，晋东南各县都加强了春耕生产第一线的力量，全区投入春耕生产高潮的有八十多万农民。各地普遍由书记挂帅，层层包干，加强领导，并且采取边检查，边下种，边验收的办法，来保证春耕播种的质量。
    今年晋东南专区计划播种各种秋作物六百一十多万亩。为了争取更大丰收，去年冬天全区人民就做了一系列的准备工作。全区深翻的土地占秋地总数78％，其中有近一百万亩土地深翻两尺到三尺。每亩秋地平均积肥两万六千多斤，约有四分之三的肥料已经送到地里。在四十多万亩土地上，初步实行了耕作园田化。新制各种工具达九十三万件，修配六十一万件。种子已普遍翻晒了一次到三次。各地还训练了大批下种技术员。（附图片）
