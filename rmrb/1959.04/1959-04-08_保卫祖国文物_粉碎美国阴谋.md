　　Following the recent attempt by Stanford University in the United States to "borrow" a large number of our precious historical relics in Taiwan to "transport them to the United States," the Chiang Kai-shek clique has "selected a batch of antiques, Chinese paintings and documents" that are "about to be shipped" to Brazil. Obviously, this is a transitional step in the long-standing conspiracy of American imperialism to steal cultural relics from Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to sell them. The Chinese people are closely watching this ongoing new conspiracy and firmly oppose the stealing behavior of American aggressors, no matter how they try to cover it up.

　　The precious historical relics that the Chiang Kai-shek clique shipped to Taiwan before the liberation of mainland China numbered more than 5,000 boxes, totaling over 100,000 pieces. These include successive generations of calligraphy, paintings, porcelain, rare books from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, and the Wen Yuan Ge Siku Quanshu; they also include most of the excavations before the War of Resistance Against Japan, most importantly all the bronzes, jades, and pottery excavated from Anyang, Junxian, and Huixian, as well as 25,000 pieces of oracle bone inscriptions. These cultural relics are extremely valuable cultural heritage of our great motherland, each with its long history, and are loved by the broad masses of the Chinese people. Since occupying our Taiwan, American imperialism has long conspired to plunder a large number of our cultural relics in Taiwan. As early as 1955, Horace Jayne, Deputy Director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the United States, publicly published an article "suggesting" that the Chiang Kai-shek clique "lend out" our historical relics in Taiwan to the United States for a "long term." At that time, due to the firm opposition of the entire Chinese people and the refusal of patriotic people and patriotic cultural workers in Taiwan to "lend," this conspiracy failed to materialize. Now, American aggressors have started a new round of theft, which is resolutely opposed by the 650 million Chinese people. As many famous figures in Chinese cultural circles have pointed out, the precious cultural relics in Taiwan are our national treasure, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique and American imperialism have no right to dispose of them. Therefore, no matter where these cultural relics are robbed to, no matter who they fall into the hands of, the Chinese people will resolutely recover them.

　　Protecting the national cultural heritage is the sacred responsibility of all Chinese people. Patriotic people and patriotic cultural workers in Taiwan should continue to shoulder their responsibilities and resolutely crush the plunder conspiracy of American imperialism. The precious heritage passed down by our ancestors for thousands of years must not fall into the hands of foreign aggressors.

　　The new conspiracy of American aggressors to plunder our cultural relics cannot but remind people that they have long been habitual thieves in this regard. In the past century, they have used many extremely despicable means to steal countless precious cultural relics from our country, not only in astonishing quantities, but also many of which are priceless treasures with important historical significance. American aggressors are now plotting a new conspiracy to rob our historical relics, which arouses great indignation among the people of our country.

　　The Chinese people will surely liberate our territory of Taiwan. Our cultural treasures in Taiwan must all be recovered. All conspiracies by American imperialism to rob our historical relics must be stopped immediately.

    保卫祖国文物  粉碎美国阴谋
    继不久前美国史丹福大学以“商借”为名，要蒋介石集团把大批我国在台湾的珍贵历史文物“运往美国”之后，蒋介石集团已“精选一批古物、国画文献”，“即将起运”到巴西。显然，这是美帝国主义长期以来企图盗劫我国台湾的文物，和蒋介石集团企图盗卖文物的预定阴谋的一个过渡方式。我国人民正密切地注意着这个正在进行中的新的阴谋活动，并坚决反对美国侵略者以任何方式加以掩盖的盗窃行为。
    蒋介石集团在中国大陆解放前夕陆续运到台湾去的珍贵历史文物，一共有五千多箱，总数在十万件以上。其中包括历代相传的书画、瓷器，宋、元、明善本书籍和文渊阁四库全书；也包括抗日战争前大部分的发掘品，最重要的是从安阳、浚县、辉县等地发掘出来的全部铜器、玉器、陶器等，以及二万五千件片刻辞甲骨。这些文物都是我们伟大祖国极其宝贵的文化遗产，每一件都有它悠久的历史，并为我国人民大众所热爱。美帝国主义自从霸占我国台湾以后，长期以来就阴谋掠夺我国在台湾的大批文物。早在1955年，美国费城艺术馆副馆长霍雷斯·杰尼曾公开发表文章，“建议”蒋介石集团以所谓“长期出借”的方式，把我国在台湾的历史文物运到美国去。当时，由于全中国人民的坚决反对，台湾的爱国人士和爱国文化工作者拒绝“出借”，这一阴谋才未能实现。现在，美国侵略者又开始了新的盗窃活动，这是六亿五千万中国人民所坚决反对的。正如我国文化界许多著名人士所指出的，在台湾的珍贵文物是我国的宝藏，蒋介石集团和美帝国主义根本无权处理这批文物。因此，不论这些文物被劫到海角天涯，落入任何外国人之手，中国人民都一定要坚决追回。
    保护祖国文化遗产是全体中国人民的神圣责任。在台湾的爱国人士和爱国文化工作者，应该继续担负起自己的职责，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的掠夺阴谋。我们祖先几千年来历代相传的珍贵遗产，决不容许落入外国侵略者之手。
    美国侵略者企图掠夺我国文物的新阴谋，不能不使人们记起他们老早就是这方面的惯盗。近百年来，他们用了许多极端卑鄙的手段，从我国窃取了无数珍贵文物，不仅数量惊人，并且很多是具有重要历史纪念意义的无价之宝。美国侵略者现在又策划劫夺我国历史文物的新阴谋，我全国人民对此表示极大的愤慨。
    中国人民一定解放我国的领土台湾。我们在台湾的文化宝藏一定要全部收回。美帝国主义劫夺我国历史文物的一切阴谋活动必须立即停止。
