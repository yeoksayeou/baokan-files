    Qinghai Poems
　　The commune is as red as the sun
    The grassland is a step to heaven,
    The broken tent has become the Jade Emperor's palace;
    Horses like colorful clouds, sheep like clouds,
    The commune is as red as the sun. Cattle and sheep ride on satellites.
    The Kunlun grassland is a thousand miles of scenery,
    The commune's red flag is flying;
    Cutting off the roots of thousands of years of poverty,
    Cattle and sheep ride on satellites.
    Red and green light shines
    One mountain and two mountains,
    Mountains connect to rivers
    Poles are planted in the lowlands.
    Generations of darkness in the tent,
    Today
    Red and green light shines in the cattle pen. Broken wooden bowls are replaced with dragon bowls
    Generations of old sheepskin cloaks,
    Today
    Sent to the museum of history;
    Broken wooden bowls used for hundreds of years,
    Pastoral cooperatives,
    Replaced with shining dragon bowls. Happiness flowers reflect red cattle and sheep pens
    Brick tea rolled into cattle blood,
    Red grapes
    A trellis has been built in the tent.
    The pastoral commune has been established,
    Happiness flowers
    Reflect red cattle and sheep pens.
              (Ke Guo, Ge Xing)

    青海诗歌
　　公社好比太阳红
    草原一步跨天庭，
    破帐篷变成了玉皇宫；
    马似彩霞羊如云，
    公社好比太阳红。牛羊儿乘上了卫星
    昆仑草原千里景，
    公社的红旗飞腾；
    斩断了千年的穷根根，
    牛羊儿乘上了卫星。
    红绿的光芒闪
    一绺儿山来两绺儿山，
    山连川  
    洼洼里都栽上了电杆。
    几辈子帐房里黑黯黯，
    到今天
    牛圈里红绿的光芒闪。破木碗换成龙碗
    几辈子披下的老羊皮，
    到今天
    送进了历史的博物馆；
    几百年用下的破木碗，
    牧业社，
    换给了闪光的龙碗。幸福花映红牛羊圈
    茯茶滚成牛血了，
    红葡萄
    帐房里搭了架了。
    牧业公社成立了，
    幸福花
    映红牛羊圈了。
              （可国、歌行）
