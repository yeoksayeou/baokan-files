    Chaiwang Eliminates the Demon
    --A Tibetan Folktale
    You Qingshu, Collection; Xu Guanzhu, Compilation

    Once upon a time, in a mountain valley not far from the Yarlung Zangbo River, there lived a poor man named Chaiwang. He lost his parents when he was young, had no wife, no relatives, and no friends. His only companions were a cow and a little dog. Only when Chaiwang sang in the highland barley fields would the red sun slowly climb over the mountains. And in the afternoon, Chaiwang's singing would send the sun to the western mountains, welcoming the moon. Although Chaiwang was thirty-five or six years old, he was still afraid of demons. Whenever he saw any demon, he would quickly hide. But in his heart, he often thought, "If I were a celestial being who could subdue demons, I would burn all the demons to ashes and not allow them to harm all the kind people anymore."

    One night on the fifteenth of the month, just as the silver platter-like moon was climbing over the mountain ridge, Chaiwang's little dog suddenly began to bark wildly, as if someone were whipping it. Then, the "clatter, clatter..." of horse hooves came closer and closer. Chaiwang could see clearly in the moonlight: a man dressed in brocade was sitting on the horse, but he couldn't see his face. "This is a demon, not a human," Chaiwang said to himself, his heart pounding like a drum. No sooner said than done, the demon dismounted and kicked open the door with a "bang," scaring Chaiwang into bowing and sticking out his tongue. He quickly handed over all the butter tea he had saved to the demon. At this moment, the demon revealed a sinister smile and said to Chaiwang, "Today I was originally going to drink all your blood and eat your heart. But you are still respectful to me, so I will spare you for the time being. But I will still come to eat you in seven days." After saying that, he mounted his horse and galloped away.

    That night, Chaiwang tossed and turned in bed, unable to fall asleep for a long time. Finally, he decided: he couldn't just wait for death, he had to escape, he had to live. He would leave here early tomorrow morning and go to a place without demons to find happiness...

    The next morning, Chaiwang left his home with the cow and the little dog, following the winding stream towards an unfamiliar place. From that day on, because there was no more Chaiwang's singing, the sun and moon no longer shone on this mountain valley.

    He walked and walked, he kept walking for two days and two nights, before he saw a courtyard with a vermilion gate. When he wanted to go in to ask for shelter, he remembered that demons lived in vermilion courtyards, so he quickly walked away. He walked for another five days and nights before he saw a white building. Now he thought he had escaped the clutches of the demon, so he boldly walked towards the house. Who knew that as soon as he entered the door, he saw the very demon he was trying to avoid sitting in the middle, grinning at him. At this moment of life and death, when he could neither advance nor retreat, Chaiwang suddenly had an idea: he boldly walked over to the demon and said, "Today is the day you are supposed to eat me. I should have been waiting for you at home, but in order to save you the trouble of going back and forth, I brought myself to you..."

    "Haha! You are so respectful to me, then I have decided to spare you and let you take care of my cattle and horses here forever. But I still want to ask you: you are such a kind person, where is your heart located?" the demon said with satisfaction.

    Chaiwang pointed to his chest and said, "My heart is located right in the middle. Where is your heart located?"

    "My heart is placed in the incense burner," the demon replied and immediately ordered Chaiwang, "Quickly prepare the horse, I am going to the village to the north to eat all the farmers and cattle and sheep."

    After the demon left, Chaiwang set up firewood, poured on butter tea, took the demon's heart out of the incense burner, and threw it into the raging fire. The demon never came back.

    Chaiwang, with his cow and little dog, happily returned to his hometown. He used his songs of labor to awaken the sun and welcome the moon, using his hands to change the face of his hometown.

    柴旺除魔鬼
    ——西藏民间故事
    游青淑　收集　徐官珠　整理
    从前，在离雅鲁藏布江不远的一个山沟里，有一个名叫柴旺的穷苦人，从小就失去了父母，没有妻子，也没有亲戚朋友，陪伴他的只有一头奶牛和一条小狗。红红的太阳，只有听到柴旺在青稞地里唱起歌来的时候，才慢慢爬上山头，下午又是柴旺的歌声把太阳送进西山，迎来月亮。柴旺虽然三十五、六岁了，可是他还是怕魔鬼。不管看到任何魔鬼，他都吓得赶快躲开。而他的心里却常想：“我若是一个降伏魔鬼的天神，我一定要把所有的魔鬼都烧成灰烬，不准它们再残害所有善良的人”。
    一个十五日的夜晚，银盘似的月亮刚刚爬上山岗，柴旺的小狗突然狂叫起来，就像有人抽打它一样。接着，“嘎达，嘎达……”的马蹄声由远而近，柴旺借着月光看得逼真：马上坐着一个穿着锦缎的男人，但看不到他的脸形。“这是魔鬼不是人。”柴旺嘴里说着，心里就像擂鼓一样咚咚地跳起来。说时迟那时快，魔鬼已经下了马，“当”的一声踢开了大门，吓得柴旺弯腰伸舌，赶紧把自己积蓄下来的酥油全都交给了魔鬼。这时魔鬼露出了狰狞的奸笑，对柴旺说：“今天我本来是要喝光你的血，吃掉你的心。但你对我还孝敬，所以暂时饶了你。但七天后我还是要来吃掉你的。”说罢，就上马飞驰而去了。
    这天晚上，柴旺在床上翻来复去久久不能入睡，最后还是决定：不能白白地等着死，要逃走，要活下去。明天一早就离开这里，到没有魔鬼的地方去寻找幸福……。
    第二天早晨，柴旺带着奶牛和小狗离开了自己的家，顺着蜿蜒的溪流，向着陌生的地方走去。从这天起，由于没有了柴旺的歌声，太阳和月亮就不再照耀这个山沟了。
    走呀，走呀，他不停地走了两天两夜，才看到一座红漆大门的院落，他想进去借宿时，记起魔鬼住的正是红漆院落，又赶紧走开。一连又走了五昼夜，看到了一座白色的楼房。这下他认为已逃脱了魔掌，便大胆向房里走去。谁知他刚一进门，看到当中坐的还是他想要逃避的那个魔鬼，正对他发着狞笑。柴旺在这生死大关、进退两难的时候，忽然心生一计：就大胆地走过去向魔鬼说：“今天是你吃我的日子，本来应在家等你，但为了不使你往返劳累，我自己给你送上门来了……”
    “哈哈！你对我这样孝敬，那我就决定把你饶恕，永远在这里替我喂牛马。但我还要问你：你为人这样忠厚，心儿长在何处？”魔鬼满意地说。
    柴旺就指着胸口说：“我的心长在正当中，你的心长在何处呢？”
      “我的心放在香炉里”。魔鬼回答后又马上命令柴旺说：“快把马备好，我要去北边的村里把那些农民和牛羊全都吃光。”
    魔鬼走后，柴旺架起了柴火，浇上酥油，从香炉里拿出魔鬼的心，扔到熊熊的烈火里，魔鬼从此再也没回来。
    柴旺又带着奶牛和小狗，高兴地回到了家乡，他又用劳动的歌声，唤起来了太阳，迎来了月亮，用双手改变着家乡的面貌。
