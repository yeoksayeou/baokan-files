Chairman, fellow committee members:

    With boundless joy, I fully endorse the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" delivered by Vice Chairman Li Weihan, the "Government Work Report" delivered by Premier Zhou Enlai, the "Report on the 1959 National Economic Plan" delivered by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the "Report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget" delivered by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress" delivered by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

    Looking back over the past four years, our country has undergone tremendous changes. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have achieved brilliant accomplishments both in the socialist revolution and in socialist construction. In the area of national political life, thanks to the great victory of the socialist revolution, especially as a result of the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the socialist consciousness of people from all walks of life has been greatly enhanced. This has further strengthened our country's people's democratic dictatorship, further strengthened the unity of the people, and enabled our country's people's democratic united front to achieve further consolidation and development. I deeply feel that this conference, held concurrently with the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, has far-reaching historical significance, because both conferences have summarized the tremendous achievements of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and will mobilize the people of the whole country to strengthen unity, exert great effort, and continue to advance along the victorious road opened up in 1958. I have been greatly encouraged and educated, and my confidence and determination to actively serve socialism have been strengthened. I very much agree with the People's Daily editorial which pointed out: "These two conferences are conferences of great unity of all nationalities in our country, and conferences of the Great Leap Forward." This is a major event that is entirely worthy of the warm celebration of the people of the whole country.

    The work of the Fujian Provincial CPPCC, like that of other parts of the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the CPPCC National Committee, and illuminated by the brilliant light of the Party's general line for building socialism, following the principles of unity, education, and transformation, has further implemented the Party's united front policies. In the past year or so, on the basis of the great victory achieved in the anti-Rightist struggle, the Provincial CPPCC has promoted and organized CPPCC members, members of various democratic parties, and people from all walks of life to actively participate in rectification, the "two-anti and two-comparison" campaign, pouring out their hearts to the Party, criticizing bourgeois academic thought, uprooting white flags and planting red flags, and carrying out the struggle between the two roads of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie; assisting and organizing members and people from all walks of life to participate in work practice and appropriate physical labor, study and visits, etc., to strengthen self-transformation; on the basis of raising awareness, mobilizing all positive factors to contribute technical skills to socialist construction, technological revolution, and cultural revolution; and in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, assisting state organs in publicizing policies, reflecting opinions and suggestions from all sides, and conducting consultations on certain issues, the CPPCC has played its due role and achieved certain results. Now I would like to focus on the situation in the area of political and ideological work to give a report.

    Organizing Political Study for People from All Walks of Life Through Three Forms

    The Fujian Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, in accordance with the spirit of the Party's general line and the instructions of the CPPCC National Committee on study, has planned to promote and organize people from all walks of life to conduct political study, and to further implement the approach of combining political and ideological leadership, labor practice as the foundation, and work posts as the base. Political study basically takes three forms: 1. Taking the original work post as the base, the relevant departments directly lead participation in the regular learning of various units; 2. Taking the form of a central study group, directly led by the Provincial CPPCC Study Committee, absorbing responsible persons of various democratic parties, people's organizations, representative figures from all walks of life, and more than one hundred librarians from the Provincial Museum of Literature and History, to study relevant important domestic and international situations and the Party's major policies and principles; 3. Running short-term, full-time political schools, rotating in batches to train people from all walks of life above the level of municipal CPPCC members. This form of study adopts the teaching policy of taking ideological transformation as the center, political theory study as the guide, labor practice as the foundation, factories and people's communes as the base, the working people as teachers, and implementing the combination of study, visits, labor, mental and physical labor, and linking theory with practice. Through the above forms of learning, we constantly improve the understanding of people from all walks of life on the development laws and characteristics of the domestic and international situation in various periods, and on the Party's various major policies and principles. Timely resolution of some incorrect ideas, and transforming negative factors into positive factors, have all played a certain role.

    This kind of short-term, full-time, mobile political school, each lasting about two months, is attended by about forty to fifty people. The content of the study focuses on the current domestic and international situation, the general line of socialist construction, the people's commune movement, and current policies, combined with on-site visits and labor practice. Finally, one week is used to conduct teaching summary, adopting the method of mass line combining individual first, then group, from bottom to top and from top to bottom. In the summary, three comparisons are made, namely, comparing learning, comparing thought, and comparing labor, and appropriate criticism and self-criticism are carried out. Students who have participated in the study believe that such learning methods and content are indeed lively, rich and colorful, and feel pleasant and benefit greatly. We also deeply realize that: (1) Adopting the teaching policy of "taking ideological transformation as the center, theoretical study as the guide, labor practice as the foundation, and the working people as teachers," and "linking theory with practice and combining mental and physical labor," is an effective measure to educate and transform bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals. Implementing the above teaching policy is precisely targeted and symptomatic, in line with the actual situation of the students, and "giving what is lacking."

    (2) Taking factories and people's communes as the base and implementing a short-term, full-time, mobile form of running schools is a good organizational form for implementing the above policy, with two advantages: 1. Running the school is easy, relying on the base, taking materials locally, arranging specific content, and the school's personnel and equipment are relatively simple, greatly saving manpower and material resources. 2. Students are satisfied. Taking factories and people's communes as the base to implement the combination of study, visits, and labor makes it easier to link with reality and improve understanding. Many students believe that this form of learning is both fresh and lively and can solve problems, saying: "This is the education of living Marxism-Leninism, it is a more comprehensive exercise given to us by the Party, and it is also an effective measure to promote our self-transformation." (3) Putting politics in command is an important guarantee for completing teaching tasks. (4) Following the mass line is an effective way to implement the "three self" policy of "voluntary, conscious, and free."

    Conducting Self-Education Through Social Observation and Labor Practice

    Social observation and labor practice are also effective ways of self-education. Therefore, we often organize people from all walks of life to visit and engage in labor practice. In order to more effectively help people from all walks of life strengthen transformation and further mobilize enthusiasm to serve socialist construction, the Provincial CPPCC and local CPPCCs organized more than 300 people to visit industrial and agricultural construction in various places. In particular, in July last year, more than 100 representative figures from all walks of life were organized to go out for rectification and to visit socialist construction such as industry, agriculture, water conservancy, and culture and education in key counties and cities in the province. Through visits, we saw the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and more deeply realized the correctness of the Party's leadership and the superiority of the socialist system. In the movement to support agricultural production, the nationwide steel refining, and the nationwide running of industry, the Provincial CPPCC organized more than 200 members, members of various democratic parties, and people from all walks of life to participate in agricultural labor, reclaim farms, work hard for ten days to accumulate more than 30,000 dan of fertilizer, and harvest more than 200 mu of rice, and established more than 20 large and small steelmaking furnaces and put them into production. In addition, a middle school was founded, with an attached bodiless lacquerware factory, which became a typical school for work-study in Fuzhou City. People from all walks of life across the province have also made many achievements in participating in labor, running factories and schools, and contributing financial resources, material resources, and technical skills. In the industrial and commercial circles alone, more than 190,000 people participated in labor last year, with an average of more than one month of labor per person. Returned overseas Chinese also have great enthusiasm. In Jinjiang Prefecture alone, the investment in seven counties including Jinjiang and Nan'an reached more than 28.7 million yuan, and nine counties including Nan'an and Fuqing held public welfare undertakings worth more than 7.8 million yuan. The CPPCCs of various cities and counties in Fujian Province also jointly held "Socialist Transformation Exhibitions" or "Socialist Education Exhibition Halls" with various circles. In Longxi Prefecture alone, eight exhibitions were held in one city and ten counties. CPPCCs in various cities and counties have also actively organized and mobilized people from all walks of life and their families to participate in labor practice and run factories, farms, and schools. Through social practice and labor exercise, people from all walks of life have been initially exercised and improved to varying degrees, have moved closer to the Party and the working people, and have contributed a lot to socialist construction.

    In March last year, the Provincial CPPCC and various democratic parties jointly held a self-transformation promotion meeting for various democratic parties, non-party democratic people, and after the meeting, a parade was held, and a letter of determination for self-transformation was presented to the Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. In May, a radio conference was held for various democratic parties, non-party democratic people, and the intellectual community to pour out their hearts to the Party. Nearly 100,000 people across the province listened to the radio, pushing the movement to pour out their hearts to a climax. In the past year or so, under the guidance of the policy of unity, education, and transformation, although certain achievements have been made in various aspects of our work, there are still many shortcomings. The main problems are that we do not have enough understanding and research on the political thoughts of people from all walks of life, the publicity and implementation of the Party and the state's policies and policies is not timely and in-depth, the activities of the work team are not balanced, and the contact with members of the Provincial CPPCC and the business guidance work of the city and county is not regular and timely, and these shortcomings need to be improved in the future.

    Vice Chairman Li Weihan pointed out in his work report that the People's Political Consultative Conference still has its important role in the country's political life and the people's democratic united front, and put forward the direction of our future work. We will resolutely bring the spirit and resolutions of this meeting back to Fujian for implementation and transmission, and do the CPPCC work well under the leadership of the Party. This meeting has given everyone great joy and encouragement, proving that our country is thriving in all aspects, which cannot but fill people with joy. More importantly, through these facts, we are full of confidence in a better future. Premier Zhou said that all our achievements are created by the united strength of all patriotic people in our country. This is our direction, our motivation, and our strength. At present, our country's people's democratic united front is more united, consolidated, and expanded than ever before. We have the confidence and determination to closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to make greater efforts and make greater contributions to the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to advance towards greater victories.

    If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please criticize and correct it.

    丰富多采　心情舒畅
    刘通委员介绍福建政协进行政治思想工作的经验主席、各位委员：
    我以无限愉快的心情，完全拥护李维汉副主席所作“中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”和周恩来总理所作的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理所作的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划的报告”，李先念副总理所作的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算的报告”，彭真副委员长所作的“全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告”。
    回顾四年多来，我们的国家发生了巨大的变化，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，已经在社会主义革命方面和在社会主义建设方面，都取得了辉煌的成就。在国家政治生活方面，由于社会主义革命的伟大胜利，特别由于反右派斗争和整风运动的结果，大大地提高了各阶层人民的社会主义觉悟。这样，就更加强了我国的人民民主专政，更加强了人民内部的团结，使我国的人民民主统一战线获得了进一步的巩固和发展。我深深感到这次会议，在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议召开期间，同时举行，是有深远历史意义的，因为两个大会都总结了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大成就，都将动员全国人民加强团结，鼓足干劲，沿着一九五八年开辟的胜利道路继续前进。我受到了极大的鼓舞和教育，加强了我积极为社会主义服务的信心和决心。我非常赞同人民日报社论所指出：“这两个大会，是我国各民族大团结的大会，大跃进的大会。”这是完全值得全国人民来热烈欢庆的大事。
    福建省政协工作和全国各地一样，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在政协全国委员会的指导下，以及在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，遵循团结、教育、改造的原则，进一步贯彻了党的统一战线方针政策。一年多来在反右派斗争取得了伟大胜利的基础上，推动省政协委员、各民主党派和各界人士积极投入整风、双反双比、向党交心、批判资产阶级学术思想、拔白旗插红旗、开展兴无灭资的两条道路斗争；帮助和组织委员和各阶层人士参加工作实践和适当的体力劳动，学习和参观等，加强自我改造；在提高认识的基础上，调动一切积极因素为社会主义建设，技术革命和文化革命，贡献技术才能；为反对国内外敌人的斗争，协助国家机关宣传政策，反映各方面的意见和建议以及就某些问题进行协商等方面，都起了政协应有的作用，并取得了一定的成绩。现在我想着重就政治思想工作方面的情况来作个汇报。
    通过三种形式组织各界人士的政治学习
    政协福建省委员会根据党的总路线精神和政协全国委员会关于学习的指示，有计划地推动和组织各界人士进行政治学习，进一步贯彻以政治思想为统帅，劳动实践为基础，工作岗位为基地三者相结合的途径。政治学习，基本上采取了三种形式：1．以原工作岗位为基地，由有关部门直接领导参加各单位的经常性学习；2．以中心组的形式由省政协学习委员会直接领导，吸收各民主党派、人民团体负责人，各界代表性人士和部分省文史馆馆员一百余人参加，学习有关国内外重要形势以及党的重大方针政策；3．举办短期、脱产的政治学校，分期分批轮训政协市委员以上的各界人士，这种学习形式都是采取以思想改造为中心，政治理论学习为先导，劳动实践为基础，工厂和人民公社为基地，劳动人民为教师，实行学习，参观，劳动，脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合，理论与实践相联系的教学方针。通过以上形式的学习，不断提高各界人士对各个时期国内外形势的发展规律和特点、对党各种重大方针政策的认识。及时解决一些不正确的思想，化消极因素为积极因素，都起了一定的作用。
    这种短期、脱产、流动的政治学校，每期约二个月左右，参加的人数约四十至五十人。学习内容以当前国内外形势，社会主义建设总路线，人民公社运动及时事政策为主，结合现场参观和劳动实践。最后用一周时间进行教学总结，采取先个人后小组，自下而上和自上而下相结合的群众路线的方法。在总结中进行三比，即比学习，比思想，比劳动，并适当开展批评与自我批评。参加过学习的学员都认为这样的学习方法和内容确实是感到生动活泼，丰富多彩，心情舒畅，得益良多。我们也深刻体会到：（一）采取“以思想改造为中心，理论学习为先导，以劳动实践为基础，以劳动人民为教师”的“理论与实践相联系，脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合”的教学方针，是教育、改造资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的有效措施。贯彻上述教学方针，正是有的放矢、对症下药，符合学员实际，“缺什么，给什么”。
  （二）以工厂和人民公社为基地，实行短期、脱产、流动形式的办学校是贯彻上述方针的良好组织形式，好处有二点：1．办学轻松，依托基地，就地取材，安排具体内容，学校人员设备都较简单，人力、物力大大节省。2．学员满意，以工厂和人民公社为基地实行学习、参观、劳动三结合，这样便于联系实际，提高认识，许多学员认为采取这种形式学习，既新鲜活泼又能解决问题，说：“这是活的马列主义的教育，是党给我们比较全面的锻炼，也是推动我们加强自我改造的有效措施。”（三）政治挂帅是完成教学任务的重要保证。（四）走群众路线是贯彻“自愿、自觉、自由”的“三自”方针的有效办法。
    通过社会观察和劳动实践进行自我教育
    社会观察和劳动实践也是个自我教育有效的办法，因此，我们经常组织各界人士参观和劳动实践，省政协和各地政协，为了更有效的帮助各界人士，加强改造，进一步调动积极性为社会主义建设服务，去年组织各界人士三百多人次到各地参观工农业建设，特别在去年七月间，组织各界代表性人士一百余人出门整风，到本省重点县、市参观工农业、水利、文教等社会主义建设，通过参观访问使我们看到社会主义建设大跃进的伟大成就，更深刻地体会到党领导的正确和社会主义制度的优越性。在支援农业生产，全民炼钢和全民办工业的运动中，省政协组织部分委员、各民主党派和社会人士二百余人参加农业劳动，开垦农场，苦战十天积肥三万多担，抢收稻谷二百余亩，并建立了大小炼钢炉二十余座投入生产。此外还创办中学一所，并附设脱胎漆器小工厂一所，成为福州市一个勤工俭学的典型学校。全省各界人士参加劳动，兴办工厂学校，贡献财力、物力、技术才能也做出了不少成绩，仅工商界去年一年中参加劳动的就有十九万多人，平均每人劳动一个月以上。归侨干劲也很大，仅在晋江专区，晋江、南安等七个县，投资额达二千八百七十多万元，南安、福清等九个县，举办公益事业达七百八十多万元。福建省各市、县政协还与各界联合举办“社会主义改造展览会”或是“社会主义教育展览馆”，仅龙溪专区，一个市和十个县就举办了八个展览会。各市、县政协也都积极组织和发动各界人士和家属参加劳动实践，大办工厂、农场和学校。通过社会实践和劳动锻炼，各界人士在不同程度上得到了初步锻炼和提高，同党和劳动人民的关系靠近了一步，为社会主义建设也贡献了不少力量。
    省政协于去年三月间与各民主党派联合举办了各民主党派、无党派民主人士自我改造促进大会，会后进行游行，并向中共省委呈献自我改造决心书，五月间又举行了各民主党派、无党派民主人士、知识界向党交心运动广播大会，全省各界收听广播近十万人，把交心运动推向高潮。一年多来，我们在团结、教育、改造方针指导下，各方面工作虽取得了一定的成绩，但还存在不少缺点，主要对各界人士政治思想了解研究不够，宣传贯彻党和国家的方针政策不够及时和深入，工作组活动不够平衡，同省政协委员的联系和对市、县的业务指导工作不够经常和及时等，这些缺点都有待今后加以改进。
    李维汉副主席在工作报告中指出，人民政治协商会议在国家政治生活和人民民主统一战线中仍有它的重要作用，并且提出了我们今后的工作方向，我们坚决把这次会议的精神和决议带回福建去贯彻传达，在党的领导下做好政协工作。这次会议给每一个人莫大的欢欣和鼓舞，证明我国在各方面都是欣欣向荣的景象，不能不使人充满愉快的心情。更重要的是通过这些事实，使我们对更加美好的未来，满怀信心。周总理说，我们的一切成就是我国全体爱国人民团结一致的力量创造的。这是我们的方向，是我们的动力，是我们的力量。目前，我国的人民民主统一战线比过去任何时候是更加团结、巩固和扩大了。我们有信心，有决心紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业，尽更大的努力，作出更大的贡献，向更大的胜利前进。
    以上发言，是否有当，请批评指正。
