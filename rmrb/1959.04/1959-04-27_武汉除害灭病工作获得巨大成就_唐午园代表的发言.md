Fellow Representatives:
	I, like everyone else, am extremely happy and encouraged to participate in this victorious congress of national unity. I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.
	Since I serve in the medical and health field in Wuhan City, please allow me to briefly report on the work in this area, focusing on key aspects.
	Over the past year, under the attention of the central, provincial, and municipal Party committees, Wuhan City's pest elimination and disease control work has been strengthened by the Party's leadership, implementing political command, and launching vigorous mass movements, achieving even greater accomplishments than in previous years. In terms of the overall task of eliminating the "four pests" and emphasizing hygiene, there is a greater emphasis on the requirements of "institutionalization and regularity," implementing the principle of prevention first.  Western medicine is being universally studied with traditional Chinese medicine, and attention is paid to cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine; acupuncture therapy is being promoted as much as possible, and valuable and novel contributions have also been made in technical innovation and the "double contribution" movement. This is also inseparable from the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward in various fields.
	Because Wuhan is a low-lying, damp area with numerous lakes and ponds, it was polluted, smelly, and prone to epidemics before liberation. During the nearly ten years since liberation, the Party, the government, and the people have made great efforts to repair them. However, because past reactionary governments did not care about the people's suffering, and because imperialists each acted independently in the concessions, the sewer system was chaotic and difficult to completely repair and transform in a short period of time. The leadership foresaw that it was necessary to start with fundamental solutions, while adopting a combination of temporary and permanent solutions to gradually resolve the problems. They have long extensively mobilized the masses to rectify many small lakes, ponds, and ditches. Currently, a combination of government funding and mass mobilization is being used to carry out the rectification projects of two larger lakes and ditches.

	Governing the Huangxiao River, Transforming Hanyang Moon Lake, Improving Environmental Sanitation, and Supporting Agricultural Production
	1.	The Huangxiao River Management Project: This small river, which discharges some sewage into the Yangtze River and transports manure to Huangpi, Xiaogan, and other places, is more than twenty li long. Its upper end is close to the urban area of Hankou and is a large stinking ditch, becoming the main sewage diversion point in the Hankou area, and is Wuhan's famous "Dragon Beard Ditch," seriously affecting the urban environment. This time, it was decided last winter to dredge the section close to the urban area of Hankou, which is more than eleven li long, starting this spring. More than 86,000 cubic meters of sewage have been discharged and silt has been dredged. In order to prevent sewage from flowing into the Huangxiao River in the future, a huge overflow pipeline has been built, using 2,600 tons of cement and 20 million red bricks, and excavating and backfilling 310,000 cubic meters of earth. The project is about to be completed, which will greatly improve the environmental sanitation of the vast suburban area of Hankou, and enable most of the sewage in the Hankou area to be used for irrigating farmland, promoting agricultural production.
	2.	The Transformation Project of Hanyang Moon Lake: According to local county chronicles, Hanyang Moon Lake was a famous Moon Tooth City as early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Historically, it was a rather beautiful scenic area, with eight scenic spots such as Boya Qin Terrace and Turtle Mountain, and was a gathering place for celebrities. After the battles of successive reactionary rulers, it was left desolate, not only were the famous historical sites and cultural relics destroyed, but it also became a lake of dead water, becoming a major breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies. Now the government has decided to transform Moon Lake and the nearby Qingchuan Pavilion, Turtle Mountain and other areas into the largest park in the center of Wuhan within three to four years, for the laboring people to visit and rest. The Municipal People's Committee has already allocated 400,000 yuan as the first phase of the transformation of Moon Lake, excavating 900,000 cubic meters of earth. After the excavation is deepened, river water will be introduced to raise fish. The annual income will be about 700,000 yuan, which is several times higher than the current income of 240,000 yuan from growing lotus roots. The subsequent expansion project investment can be carried out using the surplus from the income. This is of great significance in terms of politics, economy and the improvement of people's lives. There are also other larger lakes and ponds, such as Ziyang Lake, Fruit Lake and Sha Lake in Wuchang, which are being gradually rectified according to certain plans. While improving the urban environmental sanitation, we have strengthened the treatment of feces and the separate treatment of organic and inorganic garbage, closely combining this with the work of supporting the countryside with fertilizer accumulation and delivery. Last year, Wuhan City supported the countryside with 570,000 tons of fertilizer, and this spring, it accumulated more than 300,000 tons of fertilizer, and adopted the method of transporting agricultural fertilizer to the countryside, powerfully supporting agricultural production.

	Organize Western Medicine Doctors to Learn Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Promote the Heritage of Traditional Chinese Medicine
	In terms of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) work: According to the central government's instructions on systematically studying, fully grasping, sorting out and improving traditional Chinese medicine, organizing Western medicine doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine, promoting the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and finally becoming our country's new medicine, in recent years, the Wuhan Municipal Health Department has continuously criticized the bourgeois ideology of belittling and ignoring the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, and on this basis, carried out the work of inheriting and promoting the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, gradually establishing TCM departments in hospitals throughout the city, and absorbing as many TCM doctors as possible to participate in national health and medical institutions, adopting methods such as TCM doctors bringing apprentices, Western medicine doctors leaving production to study TCM, and establishing TCM colleges, to train a large number of TCM talents, vigorously organizing the trial use of TCM methods to treat diseases, and has achieved initial results, such as using acupuncture to treat schistosomiasis. In the preliminary observation of more than 500 cases treated in recent months, the cure rate reached 79%, which is higher than the curative effect of using the Western medicine antimony agent. Recently, the Wuhan Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital has achieved good results in treating acute meningitis with acupuncture combined with Western medicine sulfonamides. According to the analysis of the effect of treating 18 cases, using this method can greatly reduce the amount of sulfonamide used. For example, if sulfonamide is used alone, adults generally need to use 9 grams per day, and children generally need to use 6 grams. With acupuncture combined with treatment, adults and children generally only need to use 1 to 2 grams of sulfonamide. Especially in terms of using acupuncture to assist in the disappearance of clinical phenomena and first aid, it is very effective. Also, in the development of the First Hospital of this city, Western medicine doctors are encouraged to apply electro-acupuncture anesthesia to total hysterectomy of choriocarcinoma to replace the effect of anesthetics on the basis of learning acupuncture therapy. The operation time is about 4 hours, and the use in other partial surgeries of 24 cases can achieve the requirement of painless. In addition, the use of acupuncture to treat deafness and muteness, appendicitis, rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica, hemiplegia, and the use of traditional Chinese medicine to treat hookworm disease, pertussis, infantile paralysis, type B encephalitis, cirrhosis and other diseases have significant effects. Acupuncture therapy can treat many diseases because it uses the four diagnoses and eight principles and the meridian functions of traditional Chinese medicine. According to personal understanding, in order to strengthen the curative effect in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, it can also be combined with Qigong therapy. Using these methods to treat diseases can not only shorten the treatment course, but also reduce the burden on patients, and achieve the purpose of increasing production and saving. The experiment of willow branch bone setting, which is widely spread in Wuhan, has been organized with specialized forces for experiments under the attention of the municipal party committee and health department, and has achieved preliminary experience, and still needs further research and experimentation. In order to remedy the situation of Chinese medicine being out of stock, we are vigorously planting medicinal plants, striving to cultivate 15,000 to 20,000 mu of raw medicinal materials this year. Regarding the prescriptions, secret prescriptions, and verified prescriptions collected in the work of collecting folk remedies, more than 400,000 prescriptions have been collected by the end of March due to the large-scale mass movement, which are being sorted out. In order to be cautious, the leadership decided to promote them comprehensively after careful sorting, research and testing of the effective ones.

	Improved Medical Quality, Reduced Patient Suffering, and Greatly Reduced Morbidity Rates In terms of medical work, various medical systems have been greatly improved, such as implementing a three-shift outpatient system, establishing emergency stations and simple hospital beds, and reasonably adjusting the standard of medical expenses, which have been well received by the masses. In order to meet the needs of the development of industrial and agricultural production, we have taken the initiative to build new hospitals or clinics in emerging industrial areas such as Qingshan, Guanshan, Gedian, and Wudong. In factory hygiene, in order to ensure the necessary safe production of workers, no effort has been spared to publicize and strengthen dust prevention, silicosis prevention, high temperature prevention and other preventive equipment have been improved. The suburban health cause has also developed greatly, such as the suburban obstetrics and gynecology hospitals increased from one in 1957 to 124, and the number of beds increased from zero to 245, powerfully supporting agricultural production. In order to strengthen the health care cause of the people's communes, the joint clinics and maternal and child health stations originally under the leadership of the districts in the 19 people's communes in the suburbs of the city have been delegated to the leadership of the people's communes where they are located, so that they can better serve the people. In the work of implementing the health and prevention of the hospital as the center to expand the prevention guidance of local and industrial and mining areas, some experience has also begun to accumulate. From the experience of the first outpatient department of the Second Municipal Hospital and the Hubei Hospital in deepening into the streets and factories to carry out the regional medical system, and helping residents to add family beds, it not only facilitated patients, reduced the incidence of diseases, and achieved early detection and early treatment, but also improved medical quality and reduced patient suffering and burden. For example, the first outpatient department of the Second Municipal Hospital formed a four-person working group, and in a residential committee of 2,200 people, after implementing the work method of prevention first, the statistical results of the general survey and mobile medical treatment each time before and after eight months showed that there were 83 patients in the residential committee for the first time, and the incidence rate accounted for 3.8%. After eight months, when the second general survey and mobile medical treatment were carried out, there were only 15 patients, accounting for 0.9%, which greatly reduced the incidence rate.

	Although Wuhan City's health work has achieved the above-mentioned great achievements last year, it is still not adapted to the needs of the development of the new situation in the current Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the requirements of the people's increasing cultural life. There are still certain problems and shortcomings, mainly that the publicity and education on personal hygiene and public hygiene are not deep enough, and the implementation of regular hygiene systems is not comprehensive enough. In view of this, the municipal health department is further deepening the combination of public hygiene and personal hygiene to do a good job in publicity and education to the masses.
	Medical and health work is directly to serve the people's health, that is, to serve production. Comrades in the medical and health work of our city all guarantee to practice the call of "production increase and savings movement with technological revolution as the center" to contribute our wisdom and strength, and strive to serve the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958 and under the overall arrangement of the Party, and to realize the "patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests and eliminating major diseases and the sports movement aimed at strengthening the people's physique" pointed out in Premier Zhou's report.
	Finally, I express my firm support for the solemn speeches of the Tibetan representatives headed by the Panchen Lama and all other representatives on the Tibetan rebellion. In addition to criticizing the ambitions and conspiracies of imperialism and expansionists who are being allowed or even fabricating so-called Dalai statements by India, after the complete suppression of the Tibetan rebellion (which is being cleared up): we should immediately implement the long-term suppression of the Tibetan people who are under the extremely dark serf system, gradually implement democratic reforms and social reforms, and completely liberate the power of the Tibetan people to jointly participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. This is also the unanimous wish of all our fraternal ethnic groups together with the people of the whole country.

    武汉除害灭病工作获得巨大成就
    唐午园代表的发言各位代表：
    我同大家一样，万分欢欣鼓舞的参加这次的全民大团结的胜利大会。我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念两位副总理和彭真副委员长们的报告。
    由于个人是在武汉市的医疗卫生方面服务的，请就这方面的工作概要、重点作个汇报。
    一年来，武汉市的除害灭病工作，在中央和省、市委的重视下，加强了党的领导，实行政治挂帅，大搞群众动运，取得了比历年来更为巨大的成就。表现在除四害讲卫生的总任务上，更加强调了“制度化、经常化”的要求，贯彻了预防为主的方针。普遍地进行西医学习中医，并重视中西医合作；尽量推广针灸疗法，在技术革新以及“双献”运动上，也获得不少宝贵而新颖的贡献。这也与各方面大跃进的鼓励分不开的。
    由于武汉市是个洼湿地区，湖塘罗列，解放前，污染发臭，疫病流行。在解放近十年期间，党和政府及人民已经出了大力加以培修，只是由于过去反动政府根本不关心人民的疾苦，再加上帝国主义在租界中各自为政，造成下水道系统混乱，一时尚难完全重修和改造过来。领导上已预见到必须从治本着手，同时采取治标与治本相结合的办法，逐步予以解决，并早就广泛地发动群众力量，整治了很多小型湖塘沟道。目前正采取政府拨款与发动群众力量相结合的办法，进行两个较大的湖塘沟道的整治工程。
    治理黄孝河，改造汉阳月湖，改善环境卫生，支援农业生产
    一、是黄孝河的治理工程，这一个以排除部分污水出江并运粪肥到黄陂、孝感等地的小河，长二十余华里，河的上端紧靠汉口市区，是一条很大的臭水沟，成为汉口地区污水主要导流处，是武汉有名的龙须沟，严重地影响城市环境卫生，这次将紧靠汉口市区长达十一余华里的地段于去冬决定今春开始进行疏浚。已排污挖淤八万六千余立方，为了使今后污水不再流入黄孝河，另外修建了工程巨大的溢流管道，仅用水泥即达二千六百吨，红砖二千万块，翻挖和回填土方达三十一万立方。目前工程即可完工，将大大地改善汉口方面城郊广大地区的环境卫生，并使汉口地区大部污水得以利用灌溉农田，促进农业增产。
    二、是对汉阳月湖的改造工程。据地方县志传载汉阳月湖远在春秋战国时代为享盛名的月牙城，在历史上曾是一个相当优美的风景区，有伯牙琴台龟山等八景，为名人集会胜地。经过历代反动统治者的争夺战后任其荒芜，不但名胜文物销毁殆尽，而且变为一湖死水，成为孳生蚊蝇的大本营。现在政府决定在三、四年内将月湖及其附近晴川阁、龟山等地区改造成为武汉市中心最大的公园，供劳动人民游览休息，已尽先由市人委拨款四十万元，作开始改造月湖第一期工程之用，疏挖土方即达九十万立方，挖深后引入江水养鱼，每年收入约有七十万元左右，比现在种藕年产二十四万元的收入高达数倍，以后的扩建工程投资即可利用收入的赢余进行，这无论在政治上、经济上和人民生活的改善等方面都有重大的意义，还有其他一些较大的湖塘，如武昌紫阳湖、水果湖、沙湖都作出了一定计划地逐步加以整治。在改善城市环境卫生的同时，加强了粪便和分别有机和无机垃圾的处理，来紧密地结合了支援农村积肥送肥的工作，去年武汉市支援农村积肥达五十七万吨，今春又积肥三十余万吨，并采取了运送农肥下农村的办法，有力地支援了农业生产。
    组织西医学习中医，
    发扬祖国医学遗产
    在中医工作方面：根据中央提出系统学习，全面掌握，整理提高祖国医学和组织西医学习中医，促进中西医合流，最后成为我国的新医学等指示，几年来，武汉市卫生部门不断地批判了轻视和忽视祖国医学遗产的资产阶级思想，并在此基础上开展了继承和发扬祖国医学遗产的工作，逐步地在全市医院增设了中医科，尽可能地吸收很多中医参加了国家卫生医疗机构，采取中医带徒弟，西医脱产学习中医，设立中医学院等办法，大批地培养中医药人材，大力地组织了试用中医药的方法治疗疾病，并已取得初步成效，如用针灸治疗血吸虫病，几月来，在已治疗的五百多例的初步效果观察，治愈率达百分之七十九，比用西药锑剂治疗的疗效为高。最近在武汉市传染病院用针灸配合西药磺胺治疗急性脑膜炎的疗效很好。根据治疗的十八例效果分析，用这种方法，可以大大地减少磺胺用药量，如单用磺胺治疗成人一般每天需用九克，小孩一般需用六克，用针灸配合治疗，成人和小孩一般只用一至二克磺胺即可，特别是用针灸协助消失临床现象和急救方面，很有成效。又在本市第一医院的发展中，鼓励西医在学会针灸疗法的基础上，应用到电针麻醉来实施绒毛膜上皮癌的全子宫摘除术中来代替麻醉剂的效果，手术时间达四小时左右，以及使用在其他部分的手术二十四例都能达成无痛性的要求。此外，用针灸治疗聋哑、阑尾炎、风湿关节炎、坐骨神经痛、半身瘫痪和用中药治疗钩虫病、百日咳、小儿麻痹症、乙型脑炎、肝硬化等病，都有很显著的疗效。用针灸疗法，可以治疗很多疾病，这是由于运用了中医的四诊八纲和经络学功用的结果。据个人了解治疗肠胃病，为了加强疗效，还可以结合气功疗法，用这些办法治病，既可缩短治疗疗程，又可减少病人负担，达到增产节约的目的。盛传在武汉市进行的柳枝接骨的试验，在市委和卫生部门的重视下，组织了专门力量进行试验，取得了初步经验，仍有待进一步的研究和试验。为了补救中药脱销情况，正大力种植药用植物，争取今年内培种一万五千亩到二万亩生药材，关于采风工作中收集到的单方、秘方、验方等，由于大搞群众运动，到三月底已收集药方四十余万方，正进行整理，领导上为了慎重起见，决定在慎密地整理研究试验有效后再予全面推广。
    提高了医疗质量，减轻了病人痛苦，大大降低了发病率在医疗工作方面，大力地改进了各项医疗制度，如实行门诊三班制，设立急救站和简易病床，合理调整医药费用标准等，受到广大群众的好评。为了适应工农业生产发展的需要，如在青山、关山、葛店、武东等新兴的工业区主动地新建医院或门诊部。在工厂卫生上，为了保障工人安全生产的必要，不遗余力地宣传加强防尘、防矽肺、防高温等预防设备都有所提高。在郊区卫生事业亦有很大的发展，如郊区的妇产院由一九五七年的一个增加到一百二十四个，产床由无增到二百四十五张，有力地支援了农业生产。为了加强人民公社的卫生保健事业，已把市郊十九个人民公社内原属区领导的联合诊所，妇幼保健站，下放到所在人民公社领导，使其更好为人民服务。在贯彻以医院为中心扩大预防指导地方和工矿的卫生预防工作中，亦开始积累了一些经验，从市二医院第一门诊部和湖北医院深入街道、工厂开展地段医疗制，并帮助居民增设家庭病床的经验上看，不仅便利了病人，降低了发病率，做到了早期发现，早期治疗，而且还提高了医疗质量，减轻了病人的痛苦和负担，如市二医院第一门诊部组成四人工作组，在一个二千二百人的居民委员会中，贯彻以预防为主的工作方法后，在八个月前后，分别进行普查及巡回医疗各一次的统计结果，该居民委员会在第一次有病人八十三人，发病率占百分之三点八，八个月后作第二次普查和巡回治疗时，病人仅有十五名，为百分之零点九，大大地降低了发病率。
    虽然去年武汉市的卫生工作取得了上述巨大成绩，尚不能适应当前工农业生产大跃进中新形势发展的需要和人民文化生活日益提高的要求，还是存在着一定的问题和缺点的，主要是对于个人卫生和公共卫生的宣传教育不够深入，贯彻经常性的卫生制度不够全面，市卫生部门有鉴于此，正进一步深入地结合公共卫生和个人卫生向群众作好宣传教育。
    医疗卫生工作系直接为人民身体健康服务，也就是为生产服务，我市医疗卫生工作同志，都保证实践“以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动”的号召，来贡献我们的智慧和力量，并力求在一九五八年工农业大跃进的基础上和在党的全面安排下，为一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进服务，为实现周总理报告中指出的以“除四害消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动和以增强人民体质为目的的体育运动”而努力。
    最后我表示，坚决赞同以班禅为首的西藏代表们和其他所有代表们对西藏叛乱事件的严正发言，除批判了帝国主义和正由印度容许甚至捏造所谓达赖声明的扩张分子的野心阴谋而外，并在彻底平息西藏叛乱（已将肃清中）之后：立即应长期被压迫在黑暗透顶的农奴制度下的西藏人民的愿望，逐步实施民主改革、社会改革，把全藏人民的力量完全解放出来，共同参加到祖国的社会主义建设方面来。这同样是我们所有各兄弟民族连同全国人民一致的愿望。
