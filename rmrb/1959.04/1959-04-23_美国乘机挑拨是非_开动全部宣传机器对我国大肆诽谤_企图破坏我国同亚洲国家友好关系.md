Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd dispatch from Washington: U.S. imperialism has started up its entire propaganda machine, using the so-called Dalai Lama statement to engage in the despicable act of undermining the friendly relations between China and various Asian countries.

According to a report by United Press International, the notorious "Voice of America" used all thirty-seven of its foreign languages to report on this statement, especially broadcasting this lie-filled statement extensively in broadcasts to Asian countries.

Evidently considering that the name "Voice of America" has already become too infamous in the eyes of the Asian people, the news stated that the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Information Agency decided to implement a "cautious propaganda policy" on this issue. The U.S. government "adopts this policy based on the assumption that a word from people in the Asian-African group is more valuable than thousands of anti-communist words from the U.S. government."

American bourgeois newspapers have also taken the opportunity to make a big fuss about this for days, launching vicious attacks and slanders against our country.

The "New York Times" used this lie-filled statement in its editorial on the 20th to "prove" that China is "old-fashioned communist imperialism." It also hoped that the leaders of "Free Asia" would learn a "lesson" from this statement.

The "New York Herald Tribune" on the 20th further exposed the insidious purpose of the U.S. ruling clique to use the Tibetan rebellion to incite Asian countries against China. This newspaper complained that "people... pay too little attention to the impact of this event on the newly established countries of Southeast Asia. This is an event that could change the entire course of Asian affairs." This newspaper admitted that in Asia, "only a very few countries like South Vietnam adopt a firm anti-communist attitude," and that most Asian newspapers "used to oppose Western imperialism." Obviously, this newspaper is extremely unwilling to accept this phenomenon, and it hysterically clamored: "The real imperialism is in the north."

The "Cleveland Plain Dealer" used this statement on the 21st to sow discord, saying, "India now has the opportunity to lead Free Asia, and Nehru will be smart to seize this opportunity."

Despite the imperialists' painstaking efforts to slander and provoke, even the "New York Times" expressed doubts about the effect of this distorted propaganda. A reporter from this newspaper, Dou Ding, who had recently worked in Southeast Asia, published an article in the "New York Times Sunday Edition" on the 20th. He believed that "Asia's negative reaction to Tibet is limited. Some anti-communist opinions have exaggerated and distorted the real reaction, and have exaggerated its importance." This reporter admitted that the uproar surrounding the Tibetan rebellion is unlikely to cause "any policy changes" in Asian countries.

### 美国乘机挑拨是非  开动全部宣传机器对我国大肆诽谤  企图破坏我国同亚洲国家友好关系

    美国乘机挑拨是非
    开动全部宣传机器对我国大肆诽谤
    企图破坏我国同亚洲国家友好关系
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美帝国主义开动了它的全部宣传机器，利用所谓达赖喇嘛声明来进行破坏中国同亚洲各国友好关系的卑鄙勾当。
    据合众国际社报道，臭名远扬的“美国之音”曾经用它的全部三十七种外国语进行关于这个声明的报道，特别是在对亚洲国家广播中大量地广播了这个满纸谎话的声明。
    显然是考虑到“美国之音”这个名字在亚洲人民心目中已经太臭，这条消息说，美国国务院和美国新闻署决定在这个问题上执行“谨慎的宣传政策”。美国政府“采取这种政策是根据这样的设想：亚非集团国家的人说一个字要比美国政府说成千上万个反共的字眼还要有价值。”
    美国资产阶级报纸连日来也借此大做文章，对我国进行恶毒的攻击和诬蔑。
    “纽约时报”20日在社论中利用这个谎话连篇的声明来“证明”中国是“老式的共产帝国主义”。它并且希望“自由亚洲”各国领袖从这篇声明中吸取“教训”。
    20日的“纽约先驱论坛报”进一步地暴露了美国统治集团想利用西藏叛乱事件煽动亚洲国家反对中国的阴险目的。这家报纸埋怨“人们……太少注意这个事件对东南亚新建国家的影响了。这是一个可以改变亚洲事务整个进程的事件。”这家报纸承认亚洲“只有像南越那样极少数国家采取坚定的反共态度”，而大多数亚洲国家报纸“过去都是反对西方帝国主义的”。显然这家报纸对这种现象极不甘心，它歇斯底里地叫嚷道：“真正的帝国主义在北面。”
    “克利夫兰实话报”21日利用这个声明挑拨说，“印度现在有机会领导自由亚洲，尼赫鲁会聪明地抓住这个机会。”
    尽管帝国主义者费尽心机进行诽谤和挑拨，但是，连“纽约时报”也对这种歪曲宣传的效果表示怀疑。这家报纸一个最近曾在东南亚工作过的记者窦丁20日在“纽约时报星期版”上发表了一篇文章，他认为“亚洲对西藏不好的反映是有限的。一些反共的舆论夸大和歪曲了真实的反应情况，并且过份地渲染了它的重要性。”这个记者承认，围绕西藏叛乱所掀起的叫嚷很难引起亚洲国家“政策上的任何改变。”
