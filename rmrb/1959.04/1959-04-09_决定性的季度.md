    The second quarter of 1959 is a decisive quarter for achieving the great leap forward in the entire industrial production this year.

    In the first quarter, millions of workers on the industrial, capital construction, and transportation fronts continued to exert their utmost efforts and strive for advancement, achieving significant accomplishments in the execution of the national plan. The output of many important products increased substantially compared to the same period last year, and many regions and enterprises completed their quarterly plans ahead of schedule. All of this indicates that the first quarter of this year was a quarter of great leap forward. If the great leap forward in industrial production last year started after May or even later, then this year's great leap forward in industrial production unfolded after the Spring Festival, that is, four to eight months earlier than last year. However, the great leap forward in the first quarter is, after all, just a preliminary battle for the great leap forward for the whole year. The decisive quarter is the second quarter. The completion and over-fulfillment of the second quarter's plan, placing production in the third and fourth quarters in an active position, will create a favorable situation for the realization of the annual plan. Why do we say this? Because the production of many important products in the second quarter, especially the production of many mechanical equipment, is urgently needed to complete the annual plan. Whether the production plans for these important products are completed in the second quarter has a decisive impact on the completion of the annual plans of many departments. For example, completing the task of manufacturing rolling mills on schedule and ahead of schedule in the second quarter can increase the strength for increasing steel production in the second half of the year, which is one of the important conditions for realizing the annual leap forward plan for steel production. If the task of manufacturing rolling mills in the second quarter cannot be completed, and many rolling mills are delayed until the third quarter to leave the factory, then plus the time for construction, installation, and trial operation, it will always take until the beginning of the fourth quarter, or even the end of the year, to put them into production. This will not have a significant effect on completing the task of increasing steel production this year; and the reduction in steel production will affect the completion of a series of mechanical products and capital construction plans. Furthermore, the production tasks of irrigation and drainage machinery and combine harvesters in the second quarter must be completed as soon as possible in order to be used in time for drought resistance, flood control, and summer harvesting; otherwise, it will affect the completion of agricultural production plans. From this, it can be seen that "opportunity knocks but once," and every day and every hour of the second quarter are precious. Industrial production in the second quarter must be grasped tightly, fiercely, and practically, to lay a solid foundation for realizing the annual leap forward plan.

    How to fight this battle in the second quarter? There can be two approaches and two methods. One is to spread out in all directions, advancing on all fronts, distributing manpower, materials, and financial resources evenly to every industry and every department. At first glance, this seems to be a "comprehensive leap forward," but in reality, it is dispersing forces, and as a result, no one can leap forward. The other approach is to concentrate forces, break through key points, and use raw materials, especially steel, on key points. Not only should priorities be ranked in terms of importance and urgency, but also priorities should be ranked between important and important, urgent and urgent. That is to say, forces should be used in the most important of the key points and the most urgent of the urgent. This may seem not like a comprehensive leap forward, but in fact, it is the correct measure that must be taken to achieve a comprehensive leap forward. Why? Because in doing anything, it is necessary to grasp the main contradiction and stand in an active position in order to achieve victory. For example, in a war, millions of troops, if used evenly on a front stretching thousands of miles, would be difficult to have the strength to attack. Concentrating tens of thousands of elite soldiers, creating a local advantage and initiative, winning in one battle, and then attacking the rest, breaking them one by one, can create an overall advantage. Our construction is the same as fighting a war, and we must concentrate our forces on key points. Doing so may mean that some secondary products and construction projects will temporarily "give way" in the second quarter, but the main products and main construction projects can be guaranteed more reliably. After these main products and main construction projects leap forward in the second quarter, many other products and construction projects will be possible and still have time to catch up in the third and fourth quarters, so that this year's leap forward plan can be fully realized.

    What are the key points of industrial production in the second quarter? The key point of industrial production in the second quarter is still the production of raw materials, especially the production of raw materials and power for important industries, among which the production of coal and iron is the first priority. This is the key to ensuring the realization of the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward. If coking coal and iron ore are not sufficient, it will affect the production of iron; if iron is not sufficient, it will affect the production of steel and steel products, thereby affecting the overall production. To ensure the production of coal, iron, and steel, it is also necessary to ensure the supply of electricity. As the production of coal, ore, iron, and steel increases, it is necessary to increase transportation volume, that is, to increase locomotives and freight cars. Therefore, in order to ensure the production of coal and iron and to realize the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on completing the manufacturing tasks of mining equipment, coal washing and coking equipment, rolling mill equipment, power station equipment, and locomotive vehicles. At the same time, in order to ensure agricultural production, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on completing the manufacturing tasks of irrigation and drainage machinery and combine harvesters. In order to ensure the completion of these key production plans, although it is inevitable to postpone the production of certain secondary products, it does not mean relaxing the production of other products other than the key points; on the contrary, attention should still be paid to grasping the organization of production for other products such as petroleum, chemical industrial products, building materials, and certain light industrial products urgently needed by the market, especially the necessities of people's lives.

    In terms of capital construction, the key points in the second quarter are: construction projects necessary to complete this year's production tasks; projects that already have equipment and can be completed quickly; and concluding construction projects that only require a small amount of materials and equipment and can be quickly put into production. Ensuring the rapid completion of these construction projects and putting them into production is of extreme importance for realizing this year's plan. Therefore, many other construction projects other than the above must be postponed and started in the third quarter or later. Of course, this does not mean that basic construction projects that have a long construction period and have a significant role in strengthening China's industrial base can be relaxed. This only means that it is necessary to concentrate the use of forces and use limited materials on those construction projects that can produce results the fastest. After these projects are completed and put into production, with increased raw materials and equipment, other construction projects can still continue to be built in the second half of the year.

    To concentrate forces on storming these key points, it is necessary to implement the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard." This means that it is necessary to concentrate forces to ensure the completion of the national plan, prioritizing the state over the local, and prioritizing the overall situation over the partial situation. In terms of the allocation and transportation of raw materials, it is necessary to first complete the state's allocation plan; in terms of production, it is necessary to first complete the tasks stipulated by the state, and it must be completed on time, in quantity, in quality, and in complete sets; in terms of the use of raw materials, it must be used in the designated production and construction projects in accordance with the state's plan, and it is absolutely not allowed to be used for other purposes. For production and capital construction that require the use of materials uniformly distributed by the state, departments and localities should not add extra burdens at each level beyond the state plan, nor should they expand the scale beyond the state plan. In short, the whole country is one chessboard, and the initiative of all aspects must first be concentrated on completing the national plan. Initiative is always a valuable driving force for the continuous development of our country's construction cause, and we must fully mobilize the initiative of all aspects at all times; it's just that this initiative must be built on the basis of objective possibilities, and it must first be concentrated on completing the unified national plan. It is impossible to swallow two walnuts in one bite. Only with surplus strength can more new local tasks be arranged.

    To fight the battle of the second quarter well, it is also necessary to grasp production organization work tightly. The more economic work is done, the more detailed it becomes, mainly reflected in how to do production organization work more specifically, arrange and implement plans, raw materials, cooperation, etc., urge and inspect, and complete them on time. Grasping without tightening is equivalent to not grasping, and arranging without implementing is equivalent to not arranging. Our production organization work must adapt to the needs of production development. Some important equipment and important products must be implemented item by item, level by level, and at all times; otherwise, it will be difficult to guarantee the completion of the plan on time, in quantity, in quality, and in complete sets. There are also two ways to implement: one is to sit in the office and "implement" on paper calculations, or not to start from one's own conditions, but to pin all hopes unreasonably on others' help to oneself. Such "implementation" will eventually not be implemented, but will fall through. The other way to implement is to go to factories and mines to discuss with grassroots cadres and the masses, including section chiefs, workshop directors, production team leaders, and activists, and conduct multi-faceted and repeated investigations and studies, which can truly be implemented. The production tasks in the second quarter are more arduous than in the first quarter, and it is necessary to do a good job in organizing production carefully and meticulously, strengthen command and dispatch, strengthen organizational management, strengthen inspection and supervision, and practically solve specific difficulties. The State Economic Commission has already taken a series of measures in this regard. The various ministries of the central government, provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and enterprises should also have corresponding measures. For the various ministries, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, it is particularly important to strengthen the management of quarterly and monthly plans. A ministry, a province, a municipality, or an autonomous region must comprehensively grasp the plans of all aspects within the ministry, province, municipality, or autonomous region, and cannot have each person play their own game. At the same time, production command departments should be organized within the ministry and the province, municipality, and autonomous region to uniformly command production, instead of each grasping a handful and each being out of sync. Only in this way can we truly concentrate forces and break through key points. Enterprises are the grassroots organizations of production, and the place where goods are truly produced. Implementation is only truly implemented when it is implemented in the enterprise. Therefore, the production organization work of enterprises must be strengthened quickly.

    To fight the battle of the second quarter well, in the final analysis, it still depends on whether the mass movement is carried out well. No matter how accurately the key points are grasped, and no matter how well the production organization work is arranged, if there is no mass movement, "everything is ready, but the east wind is lacking," it will still be difficult to achieve complete victory. We have accumulated rich experience in carrying out mass movements on a large scale. Since this spring, a mass movement centered on the technical revolution has swept the country. Our task is to organize this movement better, concentrate the wisdom and strength of millions of people, and fight the decisive battle of the second quarter well. The first thing to do now is to hand over the plan for the second quarter, the key issues for completing this plan, and the possible difficulties to the work sections, workshops, production teams, and work teams, and to the masses, to mobilize the masses to speak out freely, post big-character posters, organize big debates, so that millions of people can understand the decisive significance of completing the second quarter plan and formulate practical measures. This requires leading personnel to go to the production front line, participate in production, lead production, and set off an even more magnificent upsurge of production and construction.

    Millions of workers on the industrial, capital construction, and transportation fronts, act with a hundredfold enthusiasm, complete and over-fulfill the plan for the second quarter, and fight this decisive battle magnificently and practically!

    决定性的季度
    1959年的第二个季度是实现今年整个工业生产大跃进的决定性的季度。
    在第一个季度里，工业、基本建设和交通运输战线上的千百万职工继续鼓足干劲、力争上游，在执行国家计划方面，取得了重大的成就。许多重要产品的产量，比去年同期有了极大的增长，许多地区和企业都提前完成了季度计划。这些都说明，今年的第一季度是一个大跃进的季度。如果说，去年工业生产的大跃进，是在5月以后甚至还晚一些才开始，那末，今年工业生产的大跃进，在春节以后，就是说比去年提早四个月甚至八个月，就展开了。但是，第一季度的大跃进，对于实现全年的大跃进说来，毕竟还是一个前哨战。决定性的季度是第二季度。第二季度的计划完成和超额完成了，使第三季度和第四季度的生产处于主动的地位，就为全年计划的实现造成有利的形势。为什么这样说呢？因为第二季度许多重要产品的生产，特别是许多机械设备的生产，是为完成全年计划所急需的。第二季度这些重要产品的生产计划完成与否，对许多部门全年计划的完成有着决定性的影响。例如，按期和提前完成第二季度制造轧钢机的任务，就可以给下半年增产钢材增加一定的力量，是实现全年钢材生产跃进计划的重要条件之一。如果第二季度制造轧钢机的任务不能完成，许多轧钢机拖到第三季度才出厂，那末再加上建设安装和试运转的时间，总要到第四季度初、甚至到年底才能投入生产。这对于完成今年增产钢材的任务，作用就不大了；而钢材生产减少，又会影响一系列机械产品和基本建设计划的完成。再如第二季度排灌机械和联合收割机的生产任务必须尽早完成，才能及时用来抗旱防涝和夏收，否则就影响农业生产计划的完成。由此可见，“机不可失，时不再来”，第二季度的每一天、每一个小时都是宝贵的。第二季度的工业生产一定要紧紧地抓，狠狠地抓，切实地抓，为实现全年的跃进计划奠定坚实的基础。
    第二季度这一仗怎么打法？可以有两种方针、两种方法。一种是全面铺开，齐头并进，把人力、物力、财力平均分给每一个行业，每一个部门。乍看起来这似乎是“全面跃进”，其实是分散力量，结果谁也不能跃进。另一种方针是集中力量，突破重点，把原材料特别是钢材使用在重点上，不仅轻重缓急要排队，而且在重与重之间、急与急之间也要排队，就是说要把力量使用在重点中的重点，急迫中的急迫方面。这看来似乎不像全面跃进，其实正是为实现全面跃进而必须采取的正确措施。为什么呢？因为做任何事情都要抓住主要矛盾，立于主动地位，才能取得胜利。比如打仗，百万雄师，若是平均使用在绵延数千里的战线上，也难有进攻的力量。集精兵数万，造成局部的优势和主动，一战而胜，再及其余，各个击破，却能造成全局的优势。我们的建设也同打仗一样，要集中力量使用于重点。这样做可能有些次要的产品和建设项目在第二季度暂时“让让路”，但是，主要产品和主要建设项目就可以得到比较可靠的保证，而这些主要产品和主要建设项目在第二季度跃上去以后，其他许多产品和建设项目就有可能而且也还来得及在第三、第四季度赶上去，从而使今年的跃进计划能够全面地实现。
    什么是第二季度工业生产的重点呢？第二季度工业生产的重点还是原材料的生产，特别是重要工业的原材料生产和动力生产，其中首先又是煤和铁的生产。这是保证实现以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针的关键所在。焦煤和铁矿石不充足，影响铁的生产；铁不充足，又影响钢和钢材的生产，从而影响到全盘生产。要保证煤、铁、钢的生产，还必须保证电力的供应。煤、矿石、铁、钢的生产增加了，就需要增加运输量，也就是说需要增加机车和货车。因此，为了确保煤和铁的生产，实现以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，又必须集中力量完成矿山设备、洗煤和炼焦设备，轧钢设备、电站设备和机车车辆的制造任务。与此同时，为了保证农业生产，又必须集中力量完成排灌机械和联合收割机的制造任务。为了保证这些重点的生产计划的完成，虽然不能不将某些次要的产品的生产推迟，但也并不是意味着放松重点以外的其他产品的生产；相反的，对其他产品如石油、化学工业品、建筑材料和市场急需的某些轻工业品，特别是人民生活必需品，仍然要注意抓紧组织生产。
    在基本建设方面，第二季度的重点是：为完成今年生产任务所必需的建设项目；现在已经有了设备，很快就可以完工的项目；只需要少许材料、设备，即可迅速投入生产的结尾性的建设项目。保证这些建设项目的迅速建成并投入生产，对实现今年的计划有极重大的意义。因此，除上述以外的其他不少建设项目，就必须推迟开工，在第三季度或者更后一些时间开工。当然，这并不意味着对于那些建设期较长而对于加强我国工业基础有重大作用的基本建设项目可以放松。这只是说，必须集中使用力量，把有限材料使用在那些能最快见效的建设项目上。这些项目完成了，投入生产了，原材料和设备增加了，其他建设项目在下半年仍然可以继续建设。
    要集中力量突击这些重点，必须贯彻“全国一盘棋”的精神。这就是说必须集中力量保证国家计划的完成，先国家后地方，先大局后小局。在原材料的调运方面，必须首先完成国家的调拨计划；在生产方面，必须首先完成国家规定的任务，而且必须按期、按量、按质、按套地完成；在原材料使用方面，必须按照国家的计划，使用在指定的生产和建设项目上，绝对不容许挪作他用。凡是需要使用国家统一分配的物资的生产和基本建设，各部门、各地方都不要在国家计划之外层层加码，也不要在国家计划之外扩大规模。总之，全国一盘棋，一切方面的积极性，都要首先集中在完成国家计划上面。积极性永远是我们国家建设事业不断发展的宝贵的动力，我们在任何时候都要充分地调动各方面的积极性；只不过这种积极性必须建立在客观可能性的基础上，而且首先要集中使用于完成统一的国家计划。一口吞不下两个核桃，有了余力，才可能再多安排地方的新任务。
    打好第二季度这一仗，还要抓紧生产组织工作。经济工作愈作愈细致，主要表现在如何更加具体的作生产组织工作，把计划、原材料、协作等等统统安排落实，督促检查，按期完成。抓而不紧等于不抓，安排而不落实等于没有安排。我们的生产组织工作一定要同生产发展的需要相适应。一些重要的设备、重要的产品，必须要项项落实、层层落实、时时落实，否则，就很难保证计划的按期、按量、按质、按套完成。落实也有两种办法：一种是坐在办公室，在纸面的计算上“落实”，或者不是从本身的条件出发，而是把一切希望无根据地寄托在别人对自己的帮助上。这样的“落实”，最后不是落实，而是落空。另一种落实是到厂矿中跟基层干部和群众，包括工段长、车间主任、生产组长、积极分子商量，多方面地反复地调查研究，这就可以真正落实。第二季度的生产任务比第一季度更加繁重，必须在生产上认真地、细致地做好组织工作，加强指挥调度，加强组织管理，加强检查督促，切切实实地解决具体困难。国家经济委员会已经在这方面采取了一系列的措施。中央各部，各省、市、自治区和各个企业也都应该有相应的措施。对于各部，各省、市、自治区说来，特别重要的是加强季度计划和月度计划的管理工作。一个部，一个省、市、自治区，都要把部内，省、市、自治区内各方面的计划综合地抓起来，不能各人一盘棋。同时，在部内和省、市、自治区内都要组织生产指挥部，统一指挥生产，不要各抓一把，各不对头，这样才能真正地集中力量，突破重点。企业是生产的基层组织，是真正出货色的地方。落实要落实在企业里才算真正落实了。因此，企业的生产组织工作要迅速加强起来。
    要打好第二季度这一仗，归根结底，还是要看群众运动搞得好不好，重点抓得再准，生产组织工作安排得再好，如果没有群众运动，“万事齐备，只差东风”，还是难以取得全胜。我们在大搞群众运动方面，已经积累了丰富的经验。今春以来，一个以技术革命为中心的群众运动已经席卷全国。我们的任务是要把这个运动组织得更好，集中千百万群众的智慧和力量，去打好第二季度这决定性的一仗。当前的第一件事情，是把第二季度的计划和完成这个计划的关键问题以及可能出现的困难，交给工段、车间、生产小组、工作队，交给群众，发动群众大鸣大放，贴大字报，组织大辩论，让千百万群众都能了解完成第二季度计划的决定性的意义，制订切实的措施。这就需要领导人员到生产前线上去，参加生产，领导生产，掀起一个更加壮阔的生产建设高潮。
    工业、基本建设和交通运输战线上的千百万职工们，百倍积极地行动起来，完成和超额完成第二季度的计划，轰轰烈烈切切实实地打好这决定性的一仗！
