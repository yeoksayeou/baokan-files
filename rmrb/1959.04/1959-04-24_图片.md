    Ten thousand acres of green waves become fields on their own,
    When the lotus breeze first rises, the grass carp are fresh and fine.
    In the evening, cast nets and go into the lake,
    The shimmering starlight falls all over the sky.

    万顷绿波自作田，荷风初起鲩鱼鲜。
    晚来撒网湖中去，摇漾星华落满天。
    左海  诗  许十明画
