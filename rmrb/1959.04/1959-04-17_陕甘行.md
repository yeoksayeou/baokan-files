　　Trip to Shaanxi and Gansu
　　Zhang Hanying
    Ode to the Diversion of the Tao River (Five Poems)
　　The willows are green and the Tao River is rich, its waves flying a thousand miles with the times;
　　Red cliffs and yellow canopies, endless mountains, sparse vegetation and scattered seedlings;
　　Lofty ambitions to lead water over mountains, long canals hanging from ridges, water flowing through streams;
　　Twenty million acres benefiting from the irrigation, with the misty clouds rising east and west of Long.

　　Songs resonate through ten thousand mountains, hands opening canals to bring water to the sky;
　　Two hundred thousand people unleashing their wisdom, creating clouds and smoke along three thousand miles;
　　The water of the West Qin irrigates the Huajialing, the fragrant green rice of the Dongzhi Plateau;
　　The earth returns to spring with bustling life, heroes are numerous this year as in ancient times.

　　Who says that the Guanshan Mountains reach the clouds, canals winding around the mountain's lips;
　　Digging, loading, transporting, and unloading, four processes, hoisting and flying hammers in a hundred new ways;
　　Work efficiency increased thirtyfold, cement production four tons per day;
　　Clever hands and minds like spring grass, blooming everywhere with the east wind.

　　Clear springs below the mountains, snow above, spring snow and mist overnight;
　　Zhu Jia Mountain split deep without a bottom, the Jiudian Gorge opened, difficult for even ghosts to touch;
　　What does it matter if equipment starts from the soil, only cowards lament the great task;
　　In two years, water flows three thousand miles, everywhere rejoicing, everywhere singing.

　　The Tao River only benefits Taozhou land, who ever imagined climbing high mountains;
　　The power of production is liberated, a spark has started a prairie fire;
　　The compass guides people forward, the General Line shines boundlessly;
　　The Communist Party's good leadership brings happiness for millions of years.
    En Route to the Hexi Corridor
　　Snow fills the mountain peaks, ice fills the gullies, ice and snow accumulate into flowing water;
　　Spring plowing covers the land, canals arranged like a chessboard, poplar trees reach the sky, the Silk Road leisurely;
　　Ancient cities stretching ten thousand miles, seemingly broken, new warehouses for boundless exchange;
　　The scenery is best in Hexi, countless chimneys piercing the sky.
    Reading "Gazetteer of Ganzhou Prefecture" in Zhangye
　　The snow of the Qilian Mountains connects to the sky, overlapping, winding and bending;
　　Ancient history delights in writing about battles, modern people write about happy chapters;
　　The lonely city and setting sun are unbearable to recite, riding the wind and waves straight ahead;
　　Endless mineral resources are newly unearthed, ten thousand miles of plains rising with clouds and smoke.
    En Route to Xinglong Mountain
　　Barren mountains and bald ridges filled Yuzhong, flourishing luxuriantly after five years;
　　If I can return another day as I wish, there's no need to climb Xinglong to appreciate the forest.
    Encountering Snow in Qian County
　　It is said that auspicious snow foretells a good harvest, but today's good harvest does not rely on heaven;
　　Water is diverted to the plateau, flowing vertically and horizontally, Shaanxi is all Guanzhong.
    Climbing the Northern Plateau of Baoji
　　Snow fills the southern mountains, green fills the valleys, spring returns to the earth, and vitality is reviving;
　　The strength of human liberation soars to the sky, allowing the painting of a beautiful landscape.
    Listening to the Water Diversion Plan for the Baoji Gorge
　　Du Mu's divine pen is as brilliant as flowers, if he saw the Wei Canal, he would only scold in vain;
　　Like a brocade, thousands of buildings, sweet rain sprinkled over happy homes.
    Climbing Jiacun Plateau, Viewing Baoji City
　　Snowy ridges as screens, grass as cushions, the Silver River like a belt, houses like clouds;
　　Houses follow the terrain, rising and falling, fertile soil and green seedlings prove ancient and modern times;
　　The phoenix's cry from Qishan is occasional, but the smoke over the Wei River is entirely up to people;
　　Butterflies play early on the yellow core of the cliffs, just a touch of spring in the human world.
    Construction Begins on the Jinghe Dafosi Reservoir
　　Steep banks stand tall for tens of thousands of years, the Great Buddha stares with one eye;
　　The people do not let the Jing River go to waste, high dams store water connecting to the sky.

　　陕甘行
　　张含英
    引洮颂（五首）
　　杨柳青青洮水肥，波涛千里逐时飞；
　　红崖黄盖山无尽，植被禾苗星点稀；
　　壮志凌云山引水，长渠挂岭水穿溪；
　　二千万亩承泽润，霞蔚云蒸陇东西。
　　歌声响震万重山，双手开渠水上天；
　　二十万人发智慧，三千里路起云烟；
　　西倾水润华家岭，青粳稻香董志原；
　　大地春回生意闹，英雄自古数今年。
　　谁说关山高入云，开渠蜿转满山唇；
　　挖装运卸四工序，绞转飞椎百样新；
　　工效提高三十倍，水泥日产四万斤；
　　心灵手巧如春草，吹过东风遍地生。
　　山下清泉山上雪，一夜春雪云雾多；
　　朱家山劈深无底，九甸峡开鬼难摸；
　　设备何妨从土起，大工只有懦夫嗟；
　　二年放水三千里，处处腾欢处处歌。
　　洮河只利洮州地，几曾设想上大山；
　　生产之力得解放，星星之火已燎原；
　　指南针引人前进，总路线发光无边；
　　共产党的好领导，幸福绵亘亿万年。
    河西走廊途中
　　雪满山巅冰满沟，冰雪积水水长流；
　　春犁遍地渠棋布，杨树参天丝道悠；
　　万里古城若断续，无边新库可交流；
　　风光最是河西好，难数烟囱冲斗牛。
    张掖读“甘州府志”
　　祁连山顶雪连天，重叠绵亘弯又弯；
　　古史喜书征战事，今人写就幸福篇；
　　孤城落日不堪诵，破浪乘风直向前；
　　无尽矿藏初出土，平川万里起云烟。
    去兴隆山途中
　　荒山秃岭满榆中，五载重逢竟郁葱；
　　他日再来如称愿，赏林不必上兴隆。
    乾县遇雪
　　相传瑞雪兆丰年，今日丰年不靠天；
　　引水上原流纵横，陕西无处不秦川。
    登宝鸡北原
　　雪满南山绿满谷，春回大地生机苏；
　　人力解放冲天劲，锦绣河山任染涂。
    听宝鸡峡引水方案
　　杜牧神笔灿生花，若见渭渠徒叱咤；
　　如锦建筑千万座，甘霖洒遍幸福家。
    登贾村原望宝鸡市
　　雪岭作屏草作茵，银川如带屋如云；
　　屋随山势分高下，土腴苗青证古今；
　　凤鸣岐山偶尔事，烟笼渭水尽由人；
　　悬崖黄芯弄蝶早，只是人间一点春。
    泾河大佛寺水库动工
　　陡岸峙立几万年，大佛瞪眼一边看；
　　人民不让泾空去，高坝蓄水水连天。
