Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, April 14th: The Yugoslav League of Communists' central organ, the "Komunist" weekly, published an article on the 9th entitled "Internationalism as Understood by the Camp," openly siding with the imperialists and viciously attacking the Communist parties in Arab countries.

The article's author, Stojkovic, plagiarized the imperialists' anti-communist platitudes, falsely accusing the Communist parties in Arab countries of "subordinating the true interests of their nations in the struggle for independence and progressive development to group interests, to the interests of camp positions in group rivalry," and that the leaders of these parties "strive to make the liberation movement of Arab countries a tool of group policy."

Disregarding the well-known fact that the Communist parties in Arab countries are the most resolute fighters for safeguarding the national interests of these countries, this weekly turned black into white, saying: "The leaders of the Communist parties in Arab countries are striking at the vital interests of their nations and running counter to the positive trends in Arab political development. Therefore, they are also alienating themselves from the basic masses among the Arab residents." The article also falsely accused the Communist parties in Arab countries of saying, "All this is for the sake of some camp 'discipline' and some camp's understanding of 'internationalism'."

　　铁托集团喉舌又唱帝国主义滥调
　　恶毒攻击阿拉伯国家共产党
    新华社14日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央机关刊物“共产主义者”周报9日发表了题为“代表阵营所理解的国际主义”的文章，公然同帝国主义者站在一起，恶毒地攻击阿拉伯国家的共产党。
    文章的作者斯托伊科维奇抄袭帝国主义者的反共滥调，诬蔑阿拉伯国家的共产党“把本民族在争取独立和进步发展斗争中的真正利益服从于集团利益，服从于在集团角逐中的阵营立场的利益”，这些党的领导“努力把阿拉伯各国的解放运动作为一个集团政策的工具”。
    这家周报不顾阿拉伯国家的共产党是维护这些国家的民族利益的最坚决的战士这个尽人皆知的事实，竟颠倒黑白地说：“阿拉伯各国共产党的领导正在打击着本民族的切身利益，并与阿拉伯政治发展中的积极倾向背道而驰。因此，他们也促使自己脱离阿拉伯居民中的基本群众。”这篇文章还诬蔑阿拉伯国家的共产党说，“这一切都是为了某种阵营的‘纪律’和某种阵营所理解的‘国际主义’。”
