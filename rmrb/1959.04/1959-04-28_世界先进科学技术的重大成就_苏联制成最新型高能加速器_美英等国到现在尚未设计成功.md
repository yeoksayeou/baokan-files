Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS reports, Soviet scientists have manufactured the world's first latest type of high-energy cyclotron accelerator. This accelerator is called a cyclotron with spatially varying magnetic field strength (also known as a cloverleaf cyclotron). The intensity of the ion beam it accelerates is thousands to tens of thousands of times greater than that of many past high-energy accelerators. Many countries, including the United States and Britain, are designing this accelerator, but have not yet succeeded.

The new type of accelerator, made at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research near Moscow, Dubna, has been in operation since January 1959.

The director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Blokhintsev, told TASS reporters when introducing this new type of accelerator that the construction of the accelerator has a very important role in the study of the atomic nucleus. At present, existing high-energy accelerators have certain shortcomings. The intensity of the ion flow drawn from these accelerators is relatively weak, and sometimes cannot meet the needs of physicists in research.

However, the characteristic of the new type of accelerator is that its magnetic field does not change with time, but with space. Therefore, the lines of maximum magnetic field strength are distributed according to the Archimedean spiral.

Finally, when evaluating this accelerator, Blokhintsev emphasized that this is a huge victory for physicists and engineers, a major achievement in world advanced science and technology, and also opens up broader prospects for accelerator construction technology.

News about this new type of accelerator will be published in the magazine "Nuclear Instruments," published in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands.

### 世界先进科学技术的重大成就  苏联制成最新型高能加速器  美英等国到现在尚未设计成功

    世界先进科学技术的重大成就
    苏联制成最新型高能加速器
    美英等国到现在尚未设计成功
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学家制成世界上第一部最新型高能量回旋加速器。这种加速器叫做带有磁场强度空间交变的回旋加速器（一名三叶草型回旋加速器）。它所加速的离子束的强度，比过去许多高能加速器大几千到几万倍。美、英等很多国家都在设计这种加速器，但至今都还未获成功。
    在莫斯科近郊杜布纳联合原子核研究所制成的这部新型的加速器，已经从1959年1月开始工作了。
    联合原子核研究所所长、苏联科学院通讯院士勃洛欣采夫在向塔斯社记者介绍这种新型加速器时说，加速器的建造工作对原子核的研究具有极重大的作用。目前，已有的高能加速器都有一定的缺点，从这些加速器所引出的离子流强度比较弱，有时不能满足物理学家在研究中的需要。
    但是，新型加速器的特点是，它的磁场不是随时间，而是随空间变化的，因此，其磁场强度最大值的线是按照阿基米德螺旋线分布的。
    最后，勃洛欣采夫在评价这种加速器时强调指出，这是物理学家和工程师们一个巨大的胜利，是世界先进科学技术的重大成就，同时也为加速器建造技术开辟了更广阔的前景。
    关于这种新型加速器的消息将要在荷兰首都阿姆斯特丹所出版的杂志“核器械”上发表。
