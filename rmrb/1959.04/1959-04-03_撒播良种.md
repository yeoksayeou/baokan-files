　　Sowing Good Seeds
　　Agricultural abundance relies on the "Eight-Point Charter," and good seeds are one of them. To use an agricultural analogy, industrial equipment is the land, while advanced technology is the good seed. Adopting advanced technology greatly increases the chances of industrial success.
　　Advanced technologies and experiences are initially created by a few people and first adopted on a small scale, achieving excellent results. However, if a workshop, a factory, an industry, or even the entire country wants to successfully complete its production plan, it must not only rely on advanced producers to skillfully use advanced technology in their work, but more importantly, it must promote advanced technology and experience to improve the technical level of the broad masses of workers.
　　There are many ways to promote advanced technologies and experiences. Launching mass movements to learn from and catch up with the advanced through various means among the broad masses is of vital importance for accelerating the improvement of production levels and completing production plans, especially in the second quarter, this decisive quarter.

    撒播良种
    农业丰收，有八字“宪法”，良种是其一。用农业术语打一个比喻，工业设备是土地，而先进技术则是良种。采用先进技术，工业丰收就大有把握。
    先进技术、先进经验，开始都是由少数人创造出来，并首先在小范围内采用，作出优异成绩。但是，一个车间、一个工厂、一个行业乃至整个国家，要想很好地完成生产计划，不仅要依赖先进生产者出色地运用先进技术进行工作，更重要的是要推广先进技术和经验，提高广大职工的技术水平。
    推广先进技术先进经验，有很多方法。通过各种各样方式，在广大群众中掀起学先进赶先进的群众运动，对于加速提高生产水平完成生产计划有着十分重要的意义，特别是在第二季度，这个决定性的季度。
