Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: Since the Tibetan rebellion, the United Arab Republic (UAR) News Bureau and the newspapers under its guidance have seized the opportunity to viciously slander China and provoke relations between China and Asian countries.

The UAR News Bureau recently published a booklet of sixty pages. This booklet openly calls the Tibetan rebellion a "Tibetan Revolution" and, borrowing fabrications spread by the imperialist propaganda machine, nonsensically claims that "Tibet is an Eastern-style Hungarian Revolution." This is "another step by international communism to 'seize dominance' and its determination to implement communist rule by force and slaughter."

This booklet attempts to incite peaceful and neutral countries in the South Asian region against communism and against China. It smears Tibet and Iraq as part of a communist plan to simultaneously take over various regions in the East. The booklet says: "The red dagger used by the communists to kill in Iraq is the same dagger they used to kill in Tibet. It seems that communism intends to strike at active neutrality and non-alignment policies in two regions simultaneously."

This booklet strives to provoke friendly relations between China and India and Nepal, saying, "If Tibet is destroyed, Nepal and India will be the next two victims of communist aggression."

The author of the booklet repeats the ungrateful and backstabbing tactics used by the UAR in its anti-Soviet and anti-communist movement, falsely claiming that the communists previously supported Nehru against Western forces, but "now Moscow seems to believe that Nehru has lost his value, so the communists are starting to establish their own bases in India to carry out propaganda against Nehru."

In order to conceal the UAR's violation of the Bandung Principles by interfering in Iraq's internal affairs, it turns around and accuses China of "trampling the principles of the Bandung Conference underfoot" by exercising sovereignty in its own territory.

The UAR's "Al-Gomhouria" (The Republic) newspaper even denies the universally recognized fact that Tibet is an indivisible part of China, stubbornly calling the treasonous acts of Tibetan reactionary elements a "revolution to get rid of communist oppression of the country and fight for Tibetan independence," and smears China of "aggression against Tibet," even clamoring that "the Tibetan revolution has become an international issue." After the so-called Dalai Lama's statement was published, this newspaper blatantly incited opposition to China, saying, "Dalai Lama's supporters will consider this statement equivalent to a declaration of war" "The battle will continue until Tibet gains independence." "Among those who sympathize with the Tibetan cause, many will join the battle as volunteers."

Cairo's "Al-Masaa" (Evening News) clumsily describes the rebellion of a small number of reactionary elements out of Tibet's total population of 1.2 million as "a revolution of 3 million people against Chinese rule," ridiculously claiming that "this revolution is part of the national liberation revolution in all parts of the world."

In order to distort the truth about the Tibetan rebellion, "Al-Ahram" (The Pyramids) newspaper, regardless of the universally known fact that Tibet has not yet carried out social reforms due to the obstruction of upper-level reactionary elements, falsely claims that the cause of the rebellion is "China's attempt to implement the communist commune system in Tibet." "Akhbar El Yom" (Today's News) absurdly fabricates rumors that this is due to "the Chinese Communist government forcing the implementation of communist practices in family life in Tibet. They put all the women in one place and stipulated the time for men and women to meet. Husbands will not have fixed wives, and no one will have fixed sons. Children belong to the state." "The Chinese invaders started a movement to starve the Tibetans."

In order to poison the friendship between Asian peaceful and neutral countries, especially India, and China, "Al-Ahram" incites: "China has at least lost the sympathy of Asian neutral countries towards it." It says, "The Chinese army's suppression of the Tibetan revolution has aroused indignation in Indian public opinion, sympathizing with the Tibetans." "Al-Messa" also provokes, saying: "The national revolution of the Tibetan people has won the sympathy of the Asian people and has affected relations between India and China." "Rose al-Yūsuf Magazine" slanders that Tibet "can be used as a springboard and bridgehead for communist expansion into Asia." "Al-Shaab" (The People) newspaper maliciously says: "China is accused of invading India after conquering Tibet."

    阿联宣传机器争当诽谤者和挑拨者
    新闻局发行小册子把西藏叛乱说成是“西藏革命”
    报纸恶毒诬蔑“中国侵略印度”大肆挑拨印中关系
    新华社23日讯　在西藏叛乱发生以后，阿联新闻局和它指导下的报纸竟然借此恶毒地诬蔑中国，并且挑拨中国同亚洲国家之间的关系。
    阿联新闻局最近专门出版了一本长达六十页的小册子。这本小册子公然把西藏叛乱说成是“西藏的革命”，而且借用帝国主义宣传机器所散布的捏造，胡说什么“西藏是东方类型的匈牙利革命”。这是国际共产主义“窃取统治地位以及决心用武力和屠杀来实行共产党统治的另一个步骤”。
    这本小册子企图煽动南亚地区的和平中立国家反对共产党，反对中国。它诬蔑说西藏和伊拉克是共产党想同时接管东方各个地区的计划的一部分。小册子说：“共产党人用来杀害伊拉克的赤色匕首就是他们用来杀害西藏的这把匕首。看来，共产主义打算同时在两个地区打击主张积极中立和不结盟政策。”
    这本小册子竭力挑拨中国同印度和尼泊尔的友好关系，它说，“如果西藏被摧毁的话，尼泊尔和印度将先后是共产主义侵略的两个牺牲者”。
    小册子的作者重复了阿联在反苏反共运动中所使用的忘恩负义反咬一口的手法，胡说什么共产党人过去支持尼赫鲁反对西方势力，可是“现在莫斯科看来认为尼赫鲁丧失了他的价值，因此共产党开始在印度建立它们自己的基地，来进行反对尼赫鲁的宣传”。
    小册子为了掩饰阿联违反万隆原则干涉伊拉克内政的行为，反噬中国在自己领土上行使主权是“把万隆会议的原则踩踏在脚底下”。
    阿联的“共和国报”竟然否认西藏是中国的不可分割的一部分这一人所公认的事实，硬把西藏反动分子的叛国行为说成是“摆脱共产党对这个国家的压迫和争取西藏独立的革命”，并且诬蔑中国“侵略西藏”，甚至叫嚷说，“西藏革命变成了国际问题”。这家报纸在所谓达赖喇嘛的声明发表以后，竟露骨地煽动反对中国说，“达赖喇嘛的支持者将认为这个声明等于是宣战”“战斗将继续进行到西藏获得独立为止”。“在那些同情西藏事业的人中，将有许多人会作为志愿军而参加战斗”。
    开罗“晚报”拙劣地把西藏总共一百二十万人口中一小撮反动分子的叛乱说成是“三百万人反对中国统治的革命”，胡扯什么“这个革命是全世界各个地方的民族解放革命的一部分。”
    为了竭力歪曲西藏叛乱的真相，“金字塔报”不顾西藏在上层反动分子阻挠下尚未进行社会改革这个人所共知的事实，造谣说叛乱的原因是“中国想在西藏实行共产党的公社制度”。“今日消息报”荒诞地造谣说这是由于“中国共产党政府在西藏强迫在家庭生活中实行共产主义制度。他们把所有的妇女都搞在一个地方，规定了男女会面的时间。丈夫将没有固定的妻子，谁也没有固定的儿子。小孩是属于国家的”。“中国侵略者开始了一个饿死西藏人的运动”。
    为了毒害亚洲的和平中立国家特别是印度同中国的友谊，“金字塔报”煽动说：“中国至少已经失去了亚洲中立国家对它的同情。”它说，“中国军队镇压西藏革命，使印度舆论激愤，同情西藏人”。“消息报”也挑拨说：“西藏人民的民族革命博得了亚洲人民的同情，并且影响了印度和中国的关系。”“图画周刊”诽谤说，西藏“可以作为共产主义向亚洲扩张的跳板和桥头堡”。“人民报”恶毒地说：“中国被指责在征服了西藏之后侵略印度。”
