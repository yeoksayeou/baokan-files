　　The Flourishing African Workers' Movement
　　Mǎ Yǎfēi
    In the surging and flourishing movement of African people striving for national independence, the African working class is a main force. It unites the peasants and other strata of people to fight against the imperialists and promotes the development of the African national independence movement.
    The African working class has grown rapidly since World War II. At present, this force has grown to 11.45 million people, accounting for more than 10% of the total African population together with their families, of which about 2.9 million are organized workers. The vast majority of African workers come from peasant backgrounds and have close ties with the peasants; at the same time, because they suffer multiple exploitation and racial discrimination and live in extreme poverty, they are very militant.
    The African trade union movement has made great progress. Before World War II, black people were not allowed to organize trade unions in most African countries, except for white employees; after the war, under the pressure of mass struggles, the colonial authorities had to make concessions and allow black people to organize trade unions, while at the same time doing their best to undermine and control these trade unions. Due to the general upsurge of national independence movements in various parts of Africa, the African workers' movement has also shown an active situation in recent years, and has formed a climax of the entire African workers' movement.
    The African workers' movement is closely integrated with the national independence movement, promoting each other. The colonists are the main employers in the area, and even the small or large struggle of workers for limited economic and social demands or for the struggle to win or defend trade union rights directly conflicts with the colonists. Therefore, in Africa, national struggle and class struggle are often naturally combined. After the war, African workers not only participated in the joint struggle with other strata of people for independence, but also directly put forward the demands for ending colonial rule and striving for national independence. As early as 1947, large-scale political strikes broke out in Algeria, Tunisia, Madagascar, French West Africa, Equatorial Africa, and Uganda, opposing the evil colonial rule. In 1950, the workers of the Gold Coast (the name before Ghana's independence), with the support of people from all walks of life, held a general strike demanding the organization of an independent government. In 1952, West African workers held a general strike, forcing the French National Assembly to pass the Labor Code. In 1953, the trade union organization of Northern Rhodesia held a protest strike to oppose the establishment of the Central African Federation. In 1952 and 1953, the people of Sierra Leone and Nigeria, with the help of trade unions, won the victory of electing their representatives to participate in the National Assembly. In 1958, the General Confederation of Black African Workers launched a widespread mass propaganda and education movement against the de Gaulle Constitution. The Moroccan Labor Union, with the working class as its core, united people from all walks of life and launched a mass movement strongly demanding that the United States and other countries withdraw their military bases. The General Union of Algerian Workers united veterans and agricultural workers and launched a struggle demanding the release of trade union leaders and striving for national independence. The Sudanese Trade Union Federation mobilized workers, peasants, and other strata of people to carry out a general strike against the former government.
    Since the beginning of this year, workers' struggles have been even more intense and have spread widely. Morocco and Libya in North Africa, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, and Liberia in West Africa, Congo, Nyasaland, Rhodesia, Cameroon, and Chad in Central Africa, miners and dockworkers in South Africa, and Kenya in East Africa have all universally erupted in strike demonstrations. These struggles all have distinct anti-colonialist content. The development of the African workers' movement has played a positive role in promoting the national independence movement. At the same time, the vigorous development of the national independence movement has promoted the African workers' movement to a climax.
    The close integration of the African workers' movement and the national independence movement is also manifested in the fact that the leaders of the workers' movement in various African countries are often also the leaders of the independence movement. After gaining independence, they often become leaders of the government. For example, Tettegah, one of the joint secretaries of the General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference, is the general secretary of the Ghana Trade Union Congress; Abdoulaye Diallo, one of the members of the General Affairs Committee, is a guiding member of the General Confederation of Black African Workers. Five of the nine members of the Supreme Committee of the Northern Rhodesia African National Congress are trade union representatives. Moroccan Deputy Speaker Majoub (General Secretary of the Moroccan Labor Union) and Guinean Prime Minister Sékou Touré (elected Chairman of the General Confederation of Black African Workers in January this year), etc. are all from trade union cadres. Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah also led the trade union for a long time. These are not accidental phenomena, indicating that the African workers' movement plays an extremely important role in the national independence movement.
    In order to more effectively oppose colonialism and strive for national independence, the trend of demanding unity in the African workers' movement is constantly developing. In January this year, trade unions in various regions of French Black Africa held a meeting and formally established the General Confederation of Black African Workers, which has exceeded the scope of the French Black African territories, and the Ghana Trade Union Congress also participated. The meeting passed a resolution stating that "there is an urgent need to unite all trade union organizations on the African continent" and preparing to "take all necessary measures to convene an all-African conference with the participation of all trade union organizations in Africa." In February this year, all trade unions in Cameroon, except for the Workers' Power Union, jointly convened a national trade union conference, preparing to merge and establish a unified Cameroon General Workers' Union, and join the General Confederation of Black African Workers after its establishment. In March this year, Nigeria's two national trade unions—the All-Nigeria Trade Union Federation and the Nigeria Trade Union Council—merged to form a unified national organization: the Nigeria Trade Union Congress, to welcome the independence to be realized next year. This trend of unity and alliance in the workers' movement in various African countries will have a major impact on the African national independence movement.
    The growth and development of trade unions in various African countries, in addition to receiving the support and help of the working class and progressive forces of their suzerain countries, has also been concerned and helped by the World Federation of Trade Unions. As early as April 1947, the World Federation of Trade Unions convened the First All-African Trade Union Conference in Dakar, French West Africa; in October 1951, it convened the Second All-African Trade Union Conference in Bamako, French West Africa; in March 1952, it convened the All-African Transport and Dock Workers Conference in Ninsand, Algeria. These meetings condemned the colonial system, put forward the tasks of the African trade union movement, first of all, to fight to liberate the African people from colonial exploitation, and pointed out that the only way for African workers to finally improve their situation is to end colonial rule and strive for complete national independence.
    In recent years, the World Federation of Trade Unions has repeatedly called on trade unions around the world to support the struggle of the African working class for independence. In September last year, the World Federation of Trade Unions also initiated and convened the "International Trade Union Conference in Support of Algerian Workers and People," and established the "International Committee in Support of Algerian Workers and People Trade Union," to regularly promote countries to provide spiritual and material assistance to Algerian workers and people. These activities have played a great role in promoting the African trade union movement and the national independence movement.
    The fraternal friendship and mutual assistance between trade unions in various African countries and trade unions in socialist countries is developing in the common anti-imperialist struggle. Trade unions in socialist countries have repeatedly organized activities to support the struggle of workers and people in Algeria, Cameroon, Congo, and Nyasaland. Some important trade union organizations in Africa, such as the General Confederation of Black African Workers, the Sudanese Trade Union Federation, the General Union of Algerian Workers, the Moroccan Labor Union, the Cameroon General Union, and the Ghana Trade Union Congress, have all established friendly cooperative relations with trade unions in socialist countries. The fraternal relations between trade unions in socialist countries and trade unions in various African countries have broken through the long-term blockade and isolation of imperialism, and are developing vigorously.
    Under the international situation in which the socialist camp is unprecedentedly strong and the national independence movement is unprecedentedly high, the African workers' movement will inevitably develop and grow stronger. With the support of socialist countries and the world working class, it will make greater contributions to the struggle for independence and liberation in Africa!

　　蓬勃发展的非洲工人运动
　　马雅菲
    在风起云涌、蓬勃发展的非洲人民争取民族独立斗争运动中，非洲的工人阶级是一支主力军。它团结了农民和其他阶层人民向帝国主义者进行斗争，推进了非洲民族独立运动的发展。
    非洲的工人阶级自第二次世界大战后即开始迅速成长。目前，这支队伍已发展到一千一百四十五万人，连同家属共占非洲总人口10％以上，其中有组织的工人约二百九十万。非洲的工人绝大多数出身于农民，与农民有着亲密的联系；同时由于遭受多重剥削与种族歧视，生活极端贫苦，因而斗争性很强。
    非洲的工会运动已有很大开展。在二次世界大战之前，除白种职工外，非洲绝大多数国家都不允许黑人组织工会；战后，殖民当局在群众斗争的压力下不得不作出让步，允许黑人组织工会，同时又竭力想破坏和控制这些工会。由于非洲各地民族独立运动的普遍高涨，非洲的工人运动近几年来也呈现出活跃的局面，并形成了整个非洲工人运动的高潮。
    非洲的工人运动与民族独立运动紧密结合，相互推动。殖民者就是当地的主要雇主，工人们即使为了有限的经济要求与社会要求或为争取、保卫工会权利的任何大小斗争，都是直接与殖民者相冲突，因此在非洲，民族斗争与阶级斗争常常是自然结合的。战后，非洲工人不仅参加了与其他阶层人民联合进行的争取独立的斗争，而且直接提出了结束殖民统治、争取民族独立的要求。早在1947年，阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、马达加斯加、法属西非、赤道非洲以及乌干达都爆发了规模巨大的政治罢工，反对罪恶的殖民统治。1950年，黄金海岸（加纳独立前名称）的工人，在各阶层人民支持下，举行了要求组织独立政府的总罢工。1952年西非工人举行总罢工，迫使法国国民议会通过劳动法典。1953年，北罗得西亚的工会组织，为反对成立中非联邦，举行了抗议罢工。1952年和1953年，塞拉勒窝内与尼日利亚人民，由于工会的帮助，赢得了选举他们的代表参加国民议会的胜利。1958年，黑非工人总联合会为反对戴高乐宪法展开了广泛的群众宣传教育运动。摩洛哥劳工联合会以工人阶级为核心，团结了各阶层人民，展开了强烈要求美国等撤出军事基地的群众运动。阿尔及利亚工人总联合会团结了退伍军人和农业工人，展开了要求释放工会领袖和争取民族独立的斗争。苏丹工会联合会发动了工人、农民以及其他阶层人民进行了反对前政府的总罢工。
    今年以来，工人斗争更加高涨，波及面也很广，北非的摩洛哥和利比亚，西非的塞内加尔、加纳、尼日利亚和利比里亚，中非的刚果、尼亚萨兰、罗得西亚、喀麦隆和乍得，南非的矿工和码头工人以及东非的怯尼亚，都普遍爆发了罢工示威斗争，这些斗争都带有鲜明的反殖民主义内容。非洲工人运动的发展对民族独立运动起了积极推动作用。同时，民族独立运动的蓬勃发展又推动工人运动走向高潮。
    非洲工人运动与民族独立运动的紧密结合，还表现在：非洲各国工人运动领袖往往也是独立运动的领袖，在获得独立后，他们也常常成为政府的领导人。例如全非人民大会总务委员会联合秘书之一特特加是加纳工会大会总书记；总务委员会的委员之一阿布杜拉耶·狄亚洛是黑非工人总联合会指导委员。北罗得西亚非洲人国民大会的最高委员会的九个委员中，有五个是工会代表。摩洛哥的副议长马久伯（摩洛哥劳工联合会总书记）和几内亚总理赛古·杜尔（今年1月当选为黑非工人总联合会主席）等都是工会干部出身。加纳总理恩克鲁玛也曾较长期地领导过工会。这些都不是偶然的现象，说明非洲工人运动在民族独立运动中起着极其重要的作用。
    为了更有效地反对殖民主义和争取民族独立，非洲工人运动中要求联合的趋势正在不断地发展。今年1月，法属黑非各地区的工会举行了会议，正式成立黑非工人总联合会，这个联合会已超过法属黑非属地的范围，加纳工会大会也参加了。会议通过决议表示“迫切需要统一非洲大陆上所有的工会组织”，准备“进行一切必要措施来召开一次非洲所有工会组织参加的全非会议”。今年2月，喀麦隆各工会，除工人力量工会外，联合召开了全国工会会议，准备合并成立统一的喀麦隆工人总工会，成立后加入黑非工人总联合会。今年3月，尼日利亚两个全国性工会——全尼日利亚工会联合会和尼日利亚工会理事会，合并成立统一的全国性组织：尼日利亚工会大会，以迎接明年即将实现的独立。非洲各国工人运动中的这种统一和联合的趋势，将对非洲的民族独立运动起重大的影响。
    非洲各国工会的成长与发展，除了得到其宗主国工人阶级和进步力量的支持和帮助外，也一直受到世界工会联合会的关心与帮助。早在1947年4月，世界工联即在法属西非达喀尔召开了第一届全非工会会议；在1951年10月又在法属西非巴马柯召开了第二届全非工会会议；在1952年3月在阿尔及利亚宁散德召开了全非洲运输与码头工人会议。这些会议谴责了殖民制度，提出非洲工会运动的任务，首先就是为了把非洲人民从殖民剥削下解放出来而斗争，指出非洲工人实现最后改进他们处境的唯一方法就是结束殖民统治，争取完全的民族独立。
    近几年来，世界工联曾多次号召世界各国工会支持非洲工人阶级争取独立的斗争。去年9月，世界工联还发起召开了“国际支援阿尔及利亚工人与人民工会会议”，成立了“国际支援阿尔及利亚工人与人民工会委员会”，以经常推动各国工会对阿尔及利亚工人和人民给予精神和物质方面的援助。这些活动对于推进非洲工会运动与民族独立运动都起了很大作用。
    非洲各国工会与社会主义各国工会之间的兄弟般友谊和互助，正在共同的反帝斗争中日益发展。社会主义各国工会多次组织了支援阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆、刚果和尼亚萨兰等国工人与人民斗争的活动。非洲的一些重要工会组织如黑非工人总联合会、苏丹工会联合会、阿尔及利亚工人总联合会、摩洛哥劳工联合会、喀麦隆总工会、加纳工会大会等都与社会主义国家工会建立了友好合作关系。社会主义国家工会与非洲各国工会之间的兄弟般关系已冲破帝国主义长期的封锁隔绝，而正在欣欣向荣地发展。
    在社会主义阵营空前强大、民族独立运动空前高涨的国际形势下，非洲的工人运动必将更加发展和壮大。它将在社会主义国家和世界工人阶级的支持下，在非洲争取独立与解放的斗争中做出更大的贡献！
