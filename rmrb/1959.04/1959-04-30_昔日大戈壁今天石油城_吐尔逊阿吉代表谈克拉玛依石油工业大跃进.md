From the Gobi Desert to an Oil City
Representative Tursun Aji Discusses the Great Leap Forward in the Karamay Oil Industry

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am an oil worker from the Karamay oil region in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. I am attending this conference with great excitement and joy. After listening to the reports of Premier Zhou and other leaders, and seeing the great victories achieved by the people of our country and our beautiful future from the reports, I feel even more excited. I fully support these reports and express my determination to earnestly implement them in my future work.

The Karamay oil region, only four years ago, was a vast and uninhabited Gobi Desert. At that time, only an old Uyghur man named Selim made a living by hunting there. Over the past three or four years, under the leadership of the Party, and through the arduous efforts of workers of all ethnic groups, overcoming various difficulties such as wind, sand, severe cold, intense heat, and water shortage, we have achieved unprecedented major victories. Today, Karamay has been built into a petroleum city of initial scale, becoming one of the important oil regions of the motherland.

Just as Premier Zhou's report stated, 1958 was an unprecedented year in China's history, a year of a tremendous and comprehensive leap forward in the national economy. Like the rest of the country, our Karamay, under the leadership of the Central Committee and the Autonomous Region Party Committee, also saw a comprehensive leap forward in all aspects of work in 1958. Drilling, well testing, and oil production all exceeded the state plan ahead of schedule by one quarter. The amount of drilling work done in 1958 alone was more than twice the total drilling done in the three years since Karamay's development began. Crude oil production was 3.3 times the total of the previous three years, and well testing was 1.6 times. Drilling efficiency was greatly improved in 1958. Before 1957, a team could only drill more than 300 meters per month. Since the Zhang Yunqing drilling team proposed the slogan "Over 1,000 meters per month, over 10,000 meters per year" at the beginning of 1958, the "Over 1,000 meters" movement has swept the oilfield, gradually developing into "1,000 meters across the board" for drilling brigades and "Over 2,000," "3,000," or even "Over 4,000" for drilling teams per month. The Zhang Yunqing drilling team drilled 4,559 meters in September, and the Sun Yuting drilling team drilled 4,873 meters in the severe winter, increasing the monthly drilling speed by 15 times compared to the past, becoming a red banner for winter drilling in the country. More than 80% of all drilling teams achieved over 1,000 meters per month, which is indeed a great leap compared to 1957!

The same is true for well testing. In the past, a team tested less than two layers per month. In 1958, the Well Testing Team No. 2 created a national record of 66.01 layers tested per month, increasing the well testing speed by 32 times compared to the past.

In terms of installation engineering, it used to take 15 days to disassemble, transport, and install a medium-sized drilling rig, and a large-sized drilling rig would take a month or even 45 days. In 1958, through the research and hard work of all comrades, and by mastering new technologies, we created the method of overall transportation of large blocks, which was later improved to the method of three-dimensional transportation, thus greatly improving installation efficiency, from the previous 15 days to 7 days, 5 days, and finally one well per day. The workers wrote the following verses: "The red sun rises and pulls up the derrick, the setting sun sinks and the drilling is busy." In the first quarter of this year, we have continued to leap forward on the basis of last year, shortening the installation time to 12 hours for a large rig at the fastest, and 75 minutes for a medium-sized rig, increasing efficiency by 35 to 90 times. The Party teaches us not to be satisfied with these achievements. Recently, we have proposed a new suggestion to move towards the goal of installing a large rig in just eight hours.

Even more exciting is that after exploration in 1958, the oil storage area in Karamay has greatly expanded outwards. In particular, the continuous discovery of high-yield oilfields in 1958 and this year has created conditions for greater development of the Karamay oil industry in the future.

In 1958, a lot of work was also carried out in oilfield construction, especially by the construction and installation workers, who demonstrated soaring enthusiasm. It only took them more than seven months to build the 147-kilometer-long Karamay-Dushanzi crude oil pipeline, which not only greatly reduced the cost of crude oil transportation and saved a large number of oil trucks, but also accumulated experience for building more and longer pipelines in the future.

The reason why we were able to achieve such great results in 1958 is first and foremost due to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the courageous struggle of workers of all ethnic groups with soaring enthusiasm under the glorious illumination of the general line for socialist construction. Last year, Vice Chairman Zhu De personally traveled a long distance to Karamay, which gave all the workers a tremendous impetus and encouragement. At that time, all the workers expressed their determination to create greater achievements to respond to the care and expectations of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

Under the leadership of the Party, the Han and Xinjiang ethnic workers, especially the Karamay ethnic workers, closely unite, help each other, cooperate, and jointly exert their efforts to strive for progress. Workers of all ethnic groups supported each other in the face of level-nine gales, carrying derricks, and lighting torches to start drilling after the lights went out. Comrade Jing Yitian, the driller, wore cotton trousers to the well to drill even in the summer because he had arthritis. In order to ensure the speed of installation, he stayed on the well for four days and four nights without leaving the front line. Our slogan is "People do not remove their armor, horses do not leave their saddles, and we will not rest until the benchmark is set!" The "March 8th" groups of female comrades also put forward the slogan "Surpass men, make a big splash in the black oil mountain." Workers of all ethnic groups share weal and woe, fight together, and make progress together in common labor and learning.

Over the past few years, under the guidance of the Party's correct ethnic policy, a large number of local minority workers have been trained, and their technical level has been rapidly improved. In 1958, the number of ethnic technical workers increased by more than three times compared to 1956. Taking myself as an example, thanks to the active guidance and enthusiastic help of Han teachers, I basically mastered the installation technology in less than a year, and now, after more than three years, I have become a relatively skilled fifth-grade technical worker. In short, workers of all ethnic groups in Karamay are closely united and advancing victoriously on the basis of socialist construction. Especially after the struggle against local nationalism was carried out in 1958, our unity is more solid than ever before. These are the basic guarantees for us to move forward in bigger strides under the leadership of the Party.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have already pointed out the direction of the leap forward for the people of all ethnic groups in the country this year. Premier Zhou's report clearly pointed out the tasks and guidelines for 1959. On the basis of the achievements we have made last year, we will definitely be able to achieve a greater leap forward. Our Karamay has already completed the tasks of the first quarter ahead of schedule by one month in important works such as drilling and oil production. The convening of this National People's Congress has given us a great impetus and encouragement. Our Karamay oil workers must, under the leadership of the Party, muster greater enthusiasm, continue to carry forward the communist spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, work hard and skillfully, and be determined to complete the annual state plans ahead of schedule and overfulfill them as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day!

The workers of all ethnic groups in our Karamay oil region, under the leadership of the Party, are closely united and more enthusiastic. We are determined to build the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region into a strong petroleum industrial base of the motherland. With the completion of the Lanxin Railway, let the blood of industry—oil—flow continuously from Karamay to all corners of the motherland like a river!

    昔日大戈壁今天石油城
    吐尔逊阿吉代表谈克拉玛依石油工业大跃进主席，各位代表：
    我是新疆维吾尔自治区克拉玛依油区的石油工人。我怀着万分激动和欢欣鼓舞的心情出席了这次大会，听了周总理及各位首长的报告，从报告中看到了我国人民所取得的伟大胜利和我国美好的前途，更觉万分兴奋，我完全拥护这些报告并表示决心在今后工作中认真地贯彻执行。
    克拉玛依油区，在四年以前还是一片人迹罕至的大戈壁，当时那儿只有一个叫赛里姆的维族老乡靠打猎维持生活。三四年来在党的领导下，经过各族职工的艰苦努力，克服了风沙严寒，酷暑和缺水等各种困难，取得了史无前例的重大胜利，今天克拉玛依已建成为初具规模的石油城市，成为祖国重要的油区之一。
    正像周总理的报告所说，一九五八年是我国历史上前所未有的，国民经济巨大的全面跃进的一年。我们克拉玛依也和全国一样，在中央和自治区党委的领导下，一九五八年各项工作都出现了全面大跃进的景象。钻井、试油、采油都提前一个季度超额完成了国家计划。一九五八年一年钻井的工作量相当于克拉玛依开发以来三年钻井总和的两倍还要多，原油生产相当于前三年总和的三点三倍，试油为一点六倍。在钻井效率方面，一九五八年有了很大的提高。一九五七年以前一个队一月只钻三百多公尺，自从一九五八年初张云清钻井队提出“月上千、年过万”的口号以后，“月上千”运动就风起云涌，逐渐发展到钻井大队“千米满堂红”和井队“月上双千”，“三千”甚至到“四千”以上。张云清钻井队九月份一个月钻进了四千五百五十九公尺，孙玉廷钻井队在严寒的冬季一个月钻进了四千八百七十三公尺，钻机月速度比以前提高了十五倍，成为全国冬季钻井的一面红旗。全年月上千井队占全部钻井队百分之八十以上，这和一九五七年比较，确实是一个很大的飞跃！
    试油方面也是一样，以往一个队一月试油不到二层，一九五八年试油二队创造了月试六十六点零一层的全国最高标杆，比过去试油速度提高了三十二倍。
    在安装工程方面，以往拆卸搬运安装一部中型钻机需要十五天，大型钻机要一个月甚至要四十五天。一九五八年经过全体同志的钻研，苦战和掌握了新的技术，创造了大块整体搬运方法，后来又改进为立体搬运方法，因而安装效率大大提高，由以往的十五天缩短到七天，五天，最后是一天一口井。工人同志写了这样的诗句：“红日东升拉井架，夕阳西下钻井忙。”今年第一季度我们更在去年的基础上继续跃进，缩短到最快时大架子十二小时安装一部，中型架子七十五分钟安装一部，提高效率三十五至九十倍。党教导我们不能满足这些成绩，最近我们又提了一项建议，准备向安装一部大架子只用八小时的方向迈进。
    更令人兴奋的是一九五八年我们经过钻探以后，克拉玛依储油面积大大向外扩展了，特别是一九五八年和今年又连续发现了高产区油田，这就给今后克拉玛依石油工业更大的发展创造了条件。
    一九五八年在油田建设上也进行了不少的工作，尤其是建筑安装工人，发挥了冲天干劲，仅花了七个多月时间建成了一百四十七公里长距离的克一独输油管线，这不仅大大降低了原油运输成本，节省下大批运油汽车，而且为今后建设更多更长的输油管线积累了经验。
    一九五八年能够取得这样大的成绩，首先是党和毛主席的英明领导，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，各族职工以冲天的干劲，奋勇斗争的结果。去年朱德副主席亲自长途跋涉来到克拉玛依，这给全体职工以极大的推动和鼓舞。当时全体职工同志表示决心，一定要创造更大的成绩，来回答党中央和毛主席对我们的关怀和期望。
    在党的领导下，汉族和新疆各族职工，特别是和克拉玛依各族职工，亲密团结互助合作，共同鼓足干劲，力争上游。各族职工曾在九级大风下相互扶持，搬运井架，在电灯熄灭以后，点起火把来开钻；司钻荆义田同志因为有关节炎，夏天他就穿着棉裤上井钻进，为了保证安装速度，他在井上四天四夜不下火线，我们的口号是“人不解甲，马不离鞍，不立标杆，誓不休！”女同志的三八组也提出“赛过男子汉，大闹黑油山”的口号。各民族职工在共同劳动和学习中是同甘共苦、共同奋斗共同进步的。
    几年来，在党的正确的民族政策指导下，大批地培养了当地少数民族工人，他们的技术水平得到了迅速提高。一九五八年民族技术工人比一九五六年增加三倍以上。就以我自己来说，由于汉族老师傅的积极教导和热情帮助，因而在不到一年的时间内，就基本上掌握了安装技术，到现在三年多的时间，我已成为一个比较熟练的五级技术工人了。总之，克拉玛依的各族职工正在社会主义建设的基础上，紧密团结，胜利前进。尤其在一九五八年进行了反对地方民族主义的斗争，我们的团结比过去任何时期都更加巩固了，这些都是我们在党的领导下，更加大踏步前进的基本保证。
    党中央和毛主席已经给全国各民族人民指出了今年跃进的方向。周总理的报告给我们明确地指出了一九五九年的方针任务。我们在取得去年成就的基础上，一定能够实现更大的跃进。我们克拉玛依在钻井、采油等重要工作上，已经提前一个月完成了第一季度的任务。这次全国人民代表大会会议的召开，更给我们以极大的推动和鼓舞。我们克拉玛依的石油工人，一定要在党的领导下，鼓起更大的干劲，继续发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义精神，苦干加巧干，决心提前超额完成全年各项国家计划，作为向国庆十周年献礼！
    我们克拉玛依油区的各族职工，在党的领导下，紧密团结，更加鼓足干劲。我们立志要把新疆维吾尔自治区建设成为一个祖国的强大的石油工业基地，随着兰新铁路的修通，让工业的血液——石油，像河水一样源源不断地从克拉玛依流向祖国的各个角落！
