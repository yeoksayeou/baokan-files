Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd dispatch from New Delhi: The Indian News Agency has revealed that Kalimpong has long been a center for conspiracy against Tibet. The leaders of the Tibetan rebels in India use it as their base.

The Indian News Agency reporter visited some prominent figures sympathetic to the rebels in Kalimpong in early April. One of them said, "All Tibetans regard Kalimpong as the second Lhasa." He said that all the rebel leaders used to live in Kalimpong not long ago, and some still live here. For example, Lukhangwa, Gyalo Thondup (the Dalai Lama's brother), Shakabpa (former Tibetan finance head), Thubten Sangye, and Alo Chongtse all live in Kalimpong. The two combat leaders of the rebel army, Andrug Gompo Tashi and Sadu Chantsa Lhonela, came here a few weeks ago. Another combat leader, Namgyal Dorje, visited Kalimpong a year ago.

He said that the rebellion was not launched suddenly as people generally believe. The rebellion was planned, and preparations began in earnest as early as 1951, when a rebel military commission under the leadership of Andrug Gompo Tashi and Namgyal Dorje was established. The rebels also established some headquarters along the borders of India, Bhutan, and Nepal, one of the important headquarters being in Chhina in the "Northeast Frontier Agency."

The Indian News Agency reported that people in Kalimpong who sympathize with the Tibetan rebels say that they trust the goodwill of the Indian government and expect Nehru to give sympathy and support.

The Indian News Agency reporter asked the Tibetans who provided the information about their future plans, and he replied that this would depend to a large extent on Nehru's attitude. He also said that he hoped they would be able to continue guerrilla warfare for several years, and their only difficulty was the lack of food.

The reporter asked how they planned to solve this problem, and he said that they would appeal for outside help, and the United States might immediately provide this help through the Kuomintang and Pakistan. When the reporter pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek could not provide assistance from Taiwan due to purely geographical reasons, he pointed out the areas occupied by the Kuomintang in northern Burma, saying that Chiang Kai-shek had appointed an agent in Calcutta to maintain contact with the rebels.

This supporter of the rebels also said that the Tibetans in Kalimpong were planning to organize assistance to the rebels. The reporter asked him: Would the Indian government allow them to provide material assistance to Tibet? He blinked and replied, "There are many ways to avoid government interference."

    印度新闻社提供的事实再一次证实
    噶伦堡是对西藏进行阴谋活动的中心
    西藏叛乱早经策划　叛乱分子另一总部设在印度契纳
    新华社22日讯　新德里消息：印度新闻社揭露噶伦堡长期以来就是针对西藏进行阴谋活动的中心。在印度的西藏叛乱分子的头目把那里当作他们的根据地。
    印度新闻社记者在4月初曾经在噶伦堡访问了一些同情叛乱分子的著名人士。其中有一个说，“所有的西藏人都把噶伦堡看作是第二个拉萨。”他说，所有的叛乱领袖不久以前都住在噶伦堡，有的现在还住在这里。例如鲁康娃、嘉乐登珠（达赖喇嘛的哥哥）、夏格巴（前西藏财政负责人）、塔·钦和阿洛·宗则都住在噶伦堡。叛军的两位作战领袖安杜·宫普·塔希和萨杜·粲·洛内拉几星期前来到了这里。另一位作战领袖南杰·多尔吉在一年前访问了噶伦堡。
    他说，叛乱并不是像人们普遍认为的那样突然发动的。叛乱是有计划的，并且早在1951年的时候就十分认真地开始了准备工作，当时成立了在安杜·宫普·塔希和南杰·多尔吉领导下的叛军军事委员会。叛乱分子还在印度、不丹和尼泊尔边境一带建立了一些总部，其中的一个重要总部就是在“东北边境特区”的契纳。
    印度新闻社的报道说，在噶伦堡的同情西藏叛乱分子的人们都说他们信赖印度政府的善意并且期望尼赫鲁会给予同情和支持。
    印度新闻社记者向提供消息的西藏人问到了他们将来的计划，他回答说，这在很大的程度上要取决于尼赫鲁的态度。他还说他希望他们将能够继续进行几年的游击战，他们唯一的困难是缺少粮食。
    记者问到他们打算怎么样解决这个问题，他说他们将呼吁外界帮助，美国可能立即通过国民党和巴基斯坦提供这种帮助。当记者指出由于纯粹的地理原因，蒋介石不能从台湾给予帮助的时候，他指出了国民党在缅甸北部所占领的地方，他说蒋介石已经指定在加尔各答的代理人同叛军保持联络。
    这位叛军的支持者还说，噶伦堡的西藏人正在计划组织对叛军的援助。记者问他：印度政府是否会允许他们向西藏提供物资援助呢？他眨一下眼睛回答说：“有许多办法可以避开政府的干涉。”
