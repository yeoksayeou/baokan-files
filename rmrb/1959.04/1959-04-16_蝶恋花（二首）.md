　　Butterfly Loves Flowers (Two Poems)
　　Ye Jianying
　　Hainan Island, a floating pearl in the South China Sea, has endured for eons, witnessing the vicissitudes of life, standing tall as a pillar of the South. The Five Finger Mountain rises high into the dew of the night, a stronghold of the Red area in those years. It is the old place where Su Dongpo left his verses, the coconut trees soar into the sky, sweeping away the fog of the long sky. The ends of the earth are different now than in ancient times, a harvest abounds with the drums and songs of the rice planting.

　　Yulin Port
　　Day after day, the cold currents seek the wild geese southward, the wind and snow of the mountain passes cannot hinder their path in the clouds, flying to Yulin the weather is already hot, summer and autumn are only separated by three days. Reaching the seaside at Deer Turning Head, the red beans are abundant, dominating the ends of the earth. The blue fish dart like shuttles in the shallow water, making one suspect they are dragon palace maids.

　　蝶恋花（二首）
　　叶剑英
　　海南岛南海浮珠历万古，阅尽沧桑，挺作南天柱。五指峰高入宿露，当年割据红区固。旧是东坡留句处，椰树凌霄，扫净长空雾，海角天涯今异古，丰收处处秧歌鼓。
　　榆林港
　　日逐寒流寻雁去，风雪关山，不碍云中路，飞到榆林天已暑，夏秋只隔三朝暮。到鹿回头滨海处，红豆离离，占断天涯路，浅水蓝鱼梭样去，教人疑是龙宫女。
