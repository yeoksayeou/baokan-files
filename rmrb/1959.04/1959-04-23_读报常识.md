How the Geda Living Buddha was Poisoned

Geda Living Buddha was a Tibetan, born in 1903 in Ganzi, Xikang. After liberation, he served as a member of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, a member of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Committee, and vice chairman of the Xikang Provincial People's Government.

Geda Living Buddha was one of the Living Buddhas respected by the Tibetan people. In 1935, when the Red Army marched north to resist Japan and passed through the Ganzi area, he actively mobilized the Tibetan people to provide strong support to the Red Army. He had great confidence in the victory of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese revolution.

In July 1950, Geda Living Buddha went to Qamdo to publicize the policies of the Central People's Government to the masses and monks in the monasteries, and emphasized that the Han and Tibetan nationalities must unite closely. Therefore, he won the support of the broad masses of Tibetan people and monasteries, but was hated by imperialists and their running dogs.

The British imperialist agent Ford and his accomplices monitored Geda Living Buddha and poisoned his tea on August 13. After being poisoned, Geda Living Buddha still wanted to call his friends in Lhasa, asking them to find a way to help him go to Lhasa. This caused even more fear among the imperialists and their running dogs, so they launched another attack on August 21, poisoning Geda Living Buddha to death and burning his body to eliminate the evidence.

The Murder of the Reting Living Buddha

In 1933, after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Reting Living Buddha was elected as Regent, responsible for controlling all military, political, and religious power in Tibet. Reting Living Buddha had patriotic and anti-imperialist ideas, so he was rejected and persecuted by British imperialists and Tibetan reactionaries. In 1941, Reting Living Buddha was forced to resign as Regent and retire to Reting Monastery. In 1943, the people of Lhasa launched a movement against the establishment of schools by British imperialists in Tibet. As a result, Reting Living Buddha became even more of a thorn in the side of British imperialists and the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group. On April 14, 1947, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group sent Sokang Wangqing Gele (a traitor in this Tibetan rebellion) and the two Kalons, Lhalu, leading the Tibetan army to Reting Monastery to arrest Reting Living Buddha and escort him to Lhasa for imprisonment. The monks of Sera Monastery in Lhasa rose up to rescue Reting Living Buddha, so the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group mobilized the Tibetan army to surround Sera Monastery and massacre the monks. These upper-class reactionaries then subjected Reting Living Buddha to the cruel torture of gouging out his eyes, and finally poisoned him to death. The three great Living Buddhas and many lamas under Reting Living Buddha were either imprisoned or exiled. Lamin Yixi Chuchen (currently a standing committee member of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region), who was Reting Living Buddha's Chikanbu (official title, equivalent to Secretary-General) at the time, was forced to live in exile in Xikang and Qinghai for several years.

The Fourteenth Dalai Lama's Father, Who Was Poisoned to Death

The fourteenth Dalai Lama's father, named Qique Cairang (sometimes translated as Labuxiu), was originally a farmer from Huangzhong County, Qinghai. In 1938, he followed the Dalai Lama to Tibet, had close relations with Reting Living Buddha, had anti-imperialist and patriotic ideas, and was poisoned to death by reactionaries in 1947.

The Tibetan Reactionary Organization "People's Conference"

The reactionary Tibetan "People's Conference" organization began to openly emerge in March 1952. This reactionary organization was presided over by former Tibetan king Lukangwa and Losang Zhaxi. On April 1, the "People's Conference" sent representatives to petition Representative Zhang Jingwu, making illegal demands such as the withdrawal of the People's Liberation Army from Tibet. The Tibetan army simultaneously surrounded Representative Zhang Jingwu's residence, and the Tibetan army also shot at Apé's home, creating a tense atmosphere in Lhasa. This was an organized and planned open opposition by the Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionaries to the agreement on peaceful liberation of Tibet, attempting to force us to make concessions and actively organizing armed rebellion. However, under Representative Zhang Jingwu's firm demand, the Tibetan local government ordered the removal of Lukangwa and Losang Zhaxi from their positions as Tibetan kings on April 27. On May 1, the Dalai Lama ordered the dissolution of the People's Conference. The pseudo-People's Conference then went underground.

In July 1954, pseudo-People's Conference members reappeared and openly engaged in activities. The open leaders included Ale Qunze, Ananlala Losang Yangpi, and Juebi Qunze. After the Dalai Lama went to Beijing to attend the National People's Congress, they claimed to demand the Dalai Lama's early return to Tibet. Using this as an excuse, they established the "People's Leadership." In the first month of 1955, they established a "Relief Society," using a legitimate organizational form to actively expand to various parts of Tibet. Within half a year, secret activities of People's Leadership members appeared in Houzang, Gyantse, Ali, Qinghai, Mozhugongka, Lhanam, and Shannan. On the one hand, they continuously distributed zanba and Tibetan currency to beggars and the poor, and distributed alms to lamas in temples. On the other hand, they spread reactionary propaganda and distributed reactionary propaganda materials. After the Dalai Lama returned to Tibet, they used the issues of Tibetan currency and the relationship between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama as excuses to submit petitions, attempting to obstruct the implementation of the State Council's resolutions on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Their conspiracy did not succeed.

After their failure, they continued to engage in reactionary activities, distributing reactionary leaflets during the February 1956 Chuanzhao ceremony. In mid-February 1956, the Tibetan local government arrested Ale Qunze. Until this open rebellion by the Tibetan local government, the illegal People's Conference continued to carry out criminal activities.

Sera Monastery

Sera Monastery is one of the three major monasteries in Tibet (Drepung Monastery, Sera Monastery, Ganden Monastery), located in the northwest suburbs of Lhasa. It was built in 1419 by Jiangqing Qujie, a disciple of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school, under the order of Tsongkhapa.

Tibetan Currency

Tibetan currency is divided into two types: coins and banknotes. Coins include silver coins and copper coins. Silver coins include ten-liang and three-liang coins. Copper coins include five-qian, three-qian five-fen, one-qian, five-fen, and one-fen half coins. Banknotes are denominated in silver taels, with denominations of one hundred taels, fifty taels, twenty-five taels, ten taels, seven taels five qian, and five taels. The main currency circulating in some cities in Tibet is Tibetan currency (banknotes), which was issued by the original Tibetan local government from 1926 to make up for the fiscal deficit. Tibet's currency system has never been linked to the mainland and has been controlled by imperialist forces since the invasion of imperialist forces.

    格达活佛怎样被毒死
    格达活佛，藏族人，1903年生于西康甘孜。解放后任西南军政委员会委员、西南民族事务委员会委员、西康省人民政府副主席。
    格达活佛是藏族人民尊敬的活佛之一。1935年红军北上抗日，经过甘孜地区，他曾积极发动藏族人民，给红军有力的支援。他对中国共产党和中国革命的胜利具有很大的信心。
    1950年7月，格达活佛前往昌都，对群众和喇嘛寺僧侣宣传中央人民政府政策，并强调汉藏民族必须紧密团结等。因此深得广大藏族人民及喇嘛寺的拥护，但却遭到了帝国主义及其走狗的忌恨。
    英帝国主义的特务福特和他的帮凶将格达活佛监视，并在8月13日给他吃了毒茶。格达活佛在受毒之后，仍要打电话给拉萨的朋友，请他们设法帮助去拉萨。这更引起了帝国主义及其走狗的恐惧，于是他们在8月21日再下毒手，用毒药把格达活佛害死，并焚尸灭迹。
    热振活佛被谋杀事件
    1933年，十三世达赖死后，热振活佛被推举为摄政，负责掌握全藏军政教大权。热振活佛具有爱国反帝思想，所以受到了英帝国主义及西藏反动分子的排斥和迫害。1941年，热振活佛被迫辞去摄政职务，退居热振寺。1943年，拉萨市人民开展了反对英帝国主义在西藏设立学校的运动。于是热振活佛更成为英帝国主义和西藏上层反动集团的眼中钉。1947年4月14日，西藏上层反动集团派了索康·旺清格勒（这次西藏叛乱事件中的叛国分子）和拉鲁两噶伦率藏军赶往热振寺，逮捕了热振活佛，并解到拉萨下狱。拉萨色拉寺僧人奋起援救热振活佛，于是西藏上层反动集团又调集藏军包围色拉寺，残杀寺僧。这些上层反动分子接着就把热振活佛处以挖去双目的酷刑，最后并把他毒死。热振活佛下属的三个大活佛和许多喇嘛，有的下狱，有的被流放。当时是热振活佛的却堪布（职名，相当于秘书长）的拉敏·益喜楚臣（现任西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员）即被迫在西康、青海一带过着好几年的流亡生活。
    被毒死的十四世达赖喇嘛的父亲
    十四世达赖喇嘛的父亲名祁却才郎（有的译为拉布秀），原为青海湟中县农民，1938年随达赖入藏，与热振活佛关系密切，有反帝爱国思想，于1947年被反动分子毒死。
    西藏反动组织“人民会议”
    西藏反动的“人民会议”组织是1952年3月开始公开出面活动的。这个反动组织由前藏王鲁康娃和罗桑扎喜主持。4月1日，“人民会议”推派代表向张经武代表请愿，提出解放军撤出西藏等非法要求。藏军同时包围了张经武代表的住宅，藏军并向阿沛家中射击，拉萨空气紧张。这是西藏地方政府和上层反动分子有组织有计划地公开反对和平解放西藏办法的协议，企图迫使我让步，并积极组织武装叛乱。但是在张经武代表坚决要求下，4月27日西藏地方政府下令撤去鲁康娃和罗桑扎喜的藏王职务。5月1日达赖下令解散人民会议。伪人民会议自此转入隐蔽斗争。
    1954年7月，伪人民会议分子再度出面公开活动。公开领导人有阿乐群则、阿南拉洛桑羊批、觉比群则等人。他们在达赖喇嘛到京出席全国人民代表大会后，扬言要求达赖喇嘛早日回藏。并以此借口成立“人民领导”。1955年正月，成立“救济会”，利用合法的组织形式积极向西藏各地扩展，半年之中，在后藏、江孜、阿里、青海、墨竹工卡、拉南、山南均出现了人民领导分子的秘密活动。他们一面不断向乞丐、贫民发放糌粑、藏钞，向寺庙喇嘛放布施，一面散布反动宣传，发放反动宣传品。达赖喇嘛返藏后，他们又以藏币和达赖同班禅关系问题为借口，上书请愿，企图阻挠国务院关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会等项决议的实现。他们这一阴谋没有得逞。
    他们在失败以后，继续进行反动活动，1956年2月传召期间散发反动传单。1956年2月中旬西藏地方政府将阿乐群则逮捕。直到这次西藏地方政府公开叛乱，非法的人民会议仍在继续进行罪恶活动。
    色拉寺
    色拉寺是西藏三大寺（哲蚌寺、色拉寺、噶丹寺）之一，在拉萨西北郊，是黄教始祖宗喀巴的弟子降青曲结在1419年奉宗喀巴之命修建。
    藏钞
    西藏的货币，分硬币和纸币两种。硬币有银币和铜币。银币有十两、三两两种。铜币有五钱、三钱五分、一钱、五分和一分半五种。纸币以银两为单位，有一百两、五十两、二十五两、十两、七两五钱、五两等几种。西藏在一些城市中流行的主要通货是藏钞（纸币），这是原西藏地方政府为了弥补财政赤字从1926年起发行的。西藏的币制，没有同内地发生过联系，自帝国主义势力入侵后，即受帝国主义的控制。
