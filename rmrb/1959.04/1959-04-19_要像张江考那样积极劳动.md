　　Strive to Work Actively Like Zhang Jiangkao
Comrade Liu Juxiang of the Xinchang People's Commune Party Committee in Yifeng County, Jiangxi Province, wrote to say that the article "Production Team Leader Zhang Jiangkao is Both Literate and Skilled" published on page 3 of this newspaper on April 3rd was very enlightening for them. This production team leader from the Jinxing People's Commune in Shanxi Province completed 610 workdays throughout the year while also doing a good job leading the team. Comrade Liu Juxiang said that everyone studied this report at the commune cadres, production team leaders, and accountants meeting held in their commune on April 8th. After a heated discussion, everyone unanimously expressed that they would learn from Comrade Zhang Jiangkao. Production team leader Cai Lucai and others immediately set out labor plans.
    We believe that it is very good that the comrades of the Xinchang People's Commune are reading the newspaper so carefully and learning from advanced figures with an open mind. It can also be seen from this that reports of advanced figures can have a huge impact in real life. We are paying attention to increasing coverage in this area. We hope that the majority of authors will give us their support.　Editor

　　要像张江考那样积极劳动
    江西宜丰县新昌人民公社党委会刘聚祥同志来信说，4月3日本报三版所载“生产队长张江考能文善武”一稿，对他们很有启发。山西金星人民公社的这位生产队长在做好队的领导工作的同时，全年还做了六百一十个劳动日。刘聚祥同志说，在他们公社4月8日召开的公社干部、生产队长和会计会议上，大家学习了这篇报道。经过热烈的讨论，大家一致表示要向张江考同志看齐，生产队长蔡禄才等当时就订出了劳动的规划。
    我们觉得新昌人民公社的同志们这样认真阅读报纸，虚心向先进人物学习，是很好的。从这里也可以看出，先进人物的报道在实际生活中可以产生巨大的影响。我们正在注意增加这方面的报道。希望广大作者给我们以支持。　编者
