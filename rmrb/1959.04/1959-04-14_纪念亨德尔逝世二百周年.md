　　Commemorating the Two Hundredth Anniversary of Handel's Death
　　Zhao Feng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Musicians Association
    George Frideric Handel, the great German composer, was born in 1685 and died in 1759. This year, April 14th, marks the two hundredth anniversary of his death. The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has declared 1959 as the Handel Memorial Year, and the World Peace Council has listed Handel as a world cultural figure. This year, progressive people around the world are commemorating this great composer with reverence. The German Democratic Republic is holding a series of commemorative activities, Moscow will grandly perform Handel's immortal oratorio "Messiah," and Beijing will also hold a memorial meeting and perform his musical works.

    Handel began his creative activities in the early eighteenth century. During this period, Germany's feudal separatism hindered the development of production, and social customs were still poisoned by religious dogmas and prejudices. Chernyshevsky once compared Germany at that time to a prison, and its people to prisoners. The masses of the people were greatly dissatisfied with the oppression and exploitation of feudal lords and hoped for a unified Germany. They were gathering strength to establish a new social order and national culture, and advanced writers and artists were preparing the ideological foundation for the bourgeois revolution. Handel was in this era and joined the ranks of advanced artists.

    Like many great figures of the time who came from the lower strata of society, Handel's father was a barber and surgeon who later served in the court of the Duke of Saxony. He hoped that his son would become a lawyer. However, Handel was a famous harpsichord player in his childhood, and Handel, who studied law at university, finally chose music as his career.

    In the early eighteenth century, musical life was monopolized by princes and nobles. Ordinary people could not easily hear formal music performances except for listening to organs in churches or dance music played by folk musicians. Bach, Handel's great contemporary, used to walk dozens or even hundreds of miles to find opportunities to listen to music, and the publication of sheet music was not yet developed. At that time, the German princes and nobles were fascinated by French fashion and worshiped Italian opera in music. Being able to give ordinary people the opportunity to appreciate music and to create their own operas had significant and progressive meaning at that time. Therefore, in 1703, the eighteen-year-old Handel left his hometown of Halle and went to Hamburg, one of the largest central cities in Germany at that time. Because, at the end of the seventeenth century, a public municipal opera house was established here, and musical life began to emerge from the small world of the feudal court, which was the germ of the social form of German musical life. In 1704, Handel wrote his first oratorio "John Passion," and the following year, at the age of twenty, Handel wrote his first opera "Almira." The opera's public performance was a great success.

    In 1706, Handel traveled to various cultural cities in Italy. In Italy, Handel thoroughly studied the writing methods and techniques of Italian opera seria. His opera "Agrippina" was recognized and welcomed by the Italians.

    Handel's mature period of creation was spent in London, England. The first opera performed in England was "Rinaldo." From 1720 onwards, Handel tirelessly and stubbornly engaged in opera creation. Handel wrote forty operas in his lifetime.

    Just as Handel worked hard to study and learn Italian music culture during his travels in Italy, Handel also enthusiastically studied and learned British folk and professional music culture during his residency in England. Handel's manuscripts contain records of the sounds of London streets and bustling markets, and Handel himself believed that many of his best songs drew inspiration from these cries and noises.

    Great literary and artistic creation is always the voice of the people of that era—in content, it describes the people's thoughts and desires, and in form, it is understood and loved by the people. In opera creation, Handel has been trying to overcome the limitations of the aesthetic principles of Italian opera—the disconnection between music and drama, and the isolation of singing from the entire drama and even from music. The good side of the aesthetic principles of Italian opera, however, is its true musicality—the art of bel canto with broad breath, smooth and magnificent melodies. The traditional opera themes at that time were myths and historical legends, while Handel's operas mostly took historical heroic figures as their themes. He strengthened the dramatic and sublime heroic elements of opera music, and strived to express the dramatic scenes perfectly and vividly in the music. The role of the orchestra was strengthened, and unprecedented choruses were introduced. But all of this seems to be preparing conditions for his later creations. In his later years, Handel found the form most suitable for his thoughts and techniques—the oratorio.

    As the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany pointed out in its message commemorating the two hundredth anniversary of Handel's death: "The shift from writing Italian operas to oratorios was an important beginning for Handel to move closer to the people." In 1738, at the age of fifty-three, Handel wrote two oratorios, "Saul" and "Israel in Egypt." This was followed by "Samson" and "Messiah." In 1745, he wrote "Occasional Oratorio" and the oratorio "Judas Maccabaeus." This earned the composer undeniable honor—the recognition and welcome of the masses for his creations. Humanistic democratic ideals were the ideological foundation of advanced thinkers and artists in the eighteenth century. They firmly believed that humans possess inexhaustible strength and talents, they saw the inevitable future of historical development in which the feudal system that hindered the liberation of human talents and strength should be eliminated, and their works reflected the people's yearning for truth and justice—scientific truth should replace ignorant religious dogmas, and social justice will inevitably defeat cruel feudal autocracy.

    In Handel's greatest works, especially in his late oratorios, the composer's humanistic ideas are concretely expressed. The oratorio "Israel in Egypt" depicts the fate, suffering, joy, and hope of ordinary people. The theme of this work is the liberation of the people from enslavement and their joy after liberation.

    Yes, this work, as well as other Handel oratorios, are based on stories from the Bible. However, we cannot lower its social significance because these works are covered with a religious cloak. As the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany pointed out in its message commemorating the two hundredth anniversary of Handel's death: "The religious themes adopted by Handel in his oratorios were intimate to the masses of the people at that time... These themes were precisely the era language he used to express the demands of the national independence struggle against feudal autocracy and the desire for a just and peaceful life." Just as some peasant uprisings also bore the banner of religious reform, the ideological content and forms used in these religious oratorios were also in line with the thoughts, emotions, and requirements of the broad social strata in the preparation and beginning stages of the bourgeois democratic revolution at that time.

    Bible stories are just metaphors and symbols. What is important is the idea conveyed by the story—the national independence struggle against feudal autocracy and the desire for a just and peaceful life. Therefore, these works can of course be understood by the composer's contemporaries who were fighting for freedom from the feudal system. This humanistic democratic ideal against feudal enslavement is also an important reason why we still admire and understand these musical works with reverence today.

    The first characteristic of Handel's musical creation is the plasticity of his music. "Israel in Egypt" contains many picturesque descriptions. People say that this work is a magnificent, epic painting. And this giant painting uses expressive, vivid, pure, and nature-based melodies as its main means of expression. The theme is based on expressive melodies, the harmony is simple and clear, the rhythm is distinct and powerful, and the modulation techniques are simple and natural, but all of this seems magnificent and powerful. It is precisely because of the composer's belief in the future society, that is, the belief that the future society should be a kingdom of reason and justice, that the composer always adopts this healthy attitude towards life and the objective world.

    The second characteristic of Handel's musical creation is its epic nature. Heroic themes and grand genres are the most prominent features. In all his oratorios, the chorus is one of his main means. The protagonist of the epic is the people, who are represented in the oratorio by the chorus form. The formation of the composer's magnificent style, the use of the chorus form, is one of the characteristics and reasons for this style. Dignified and powerful choruses constitute magnificent epic scenes. As Romain Rolland said, "There is no individual epic." In the oratorio "Israel in Egypt," there are no individual characters or protagonists; the people are the protagonists and heroes of the epic.

    The third characteristic of Handel's musical creation is its dramatic nature. Handel's other great oratorio, "Samson," can be said to be a representative of this dramatic oratorio. People say: "Israel in Egypt" is the composer's model of an epic oratorio. In the oratorio "Samson," the composer uses recitatives, arias, and ensemble singing to portray the sharp dramatic conflicts in the plot and to depict the characters in the dramatic conflicts.

    Picturesque plasticity, magnificent epic nature, and descriptive dramatic nature—these are the realistic characteristics of Handel's musical creation.

    Handel's musical creation made him the first German composer in music history with broad pan-European and even world significance. Handel was the first composer to creatively inherit and summarize the achievements of German, Italian, French, and British folk and professional music culture, and to bring them together and carry them forward. Handel was good at using music to express his humanistic democratic ideals, and he was also good at using various expressive techniques to serve his creative will. The composer's humanistic democratic ideals made his music have a strong popular character. "If my music can only make people happy, I regret it. My purpose is to make people noble," this is the composer's creative principle and aesthetic belief—to free the people from enslavement and ignorance, to make the people morally noble, and to create a future society dominated by reason and justice. This is the fundamental reason why ancient classical art still has unlimited youth and charm today. The greatness of Handel's musical works lies in the fact that while revealing the beautiful ideals of advanced humanity at that time, it always encourages people to pursue their ideals and believe in life with an optimistic spirit.

### 纪念亨德尔逝世二百周年

　　纪念亨德尔逝世二百周年
　　中国音乐家协会书记处书记　赵沨
    乔治·弗里德里希·亨德尔，德国伟大的作曲家，生于1685年，死于1759年，今年4月14日是他逝世的二百周年纪念日。德国统一社会党中央宣布1959年为亨德尔纪念年，世界和平理事会把亨德尔列为世界文化名人。今年，全世界进步人类都怀着崇敬的心情纪念这位伟大的作曲家，德意志民主共和国举行了一系列的纪念活动，莫斯科将隆重演出亨德尔的不朽的清唱剧“弥赛亚”，北京也将举行纪念会并演奏他的音乐作品。
    十八世纪初叶，亨德尔开始了他的创作活动。这个时期的德国，由于封建割据阻碍了生产的发展，社会风气还受着宗教教义和偏见的毒害，车尔尼雪夫斯基曾把当时的德国比做监狱，把它的人民比做囚犯。人民群众对封建诸侯的压迫和剥削正怀巨大的不满，希望统一德国。他们正为建立新的社会秩序和民族文化的理想聚集着力量，先进的文学家、艺术家正为资产阶级革命准备思想基础。亨德尔便处在这个时代，并参加了先进艺术家的行列。
    像当时许多伟大人物出身于社会的下层一样，亨德尔的父亲是理发师兼外科医生，后来进了撒克逊公爵宫廷服务。他希望自己的儿子能成为一个法学家。但幼年时期的亨德尔便是一个演奏古钢琴的名手了，在大学学法律的亨德尔最后终于选择音乐作为自己的职业。
    十八世纪初叶，那时的音乐生活为王公贵族们所独占，一般人除了在教堂听管风琴或者听民间乐手们搞舞蹈音乐之外，不容易听到正式的音乐演奏。亨德尔的伟大的同时代人巴哈便曾经经常步行几十里以至几百里去寻听音乐的机会，乐谱的出版还不发达。当时德国王公贵族们醉心于法国的风尚，在音乐上崇拜意大利的歌剧。能使一般人有欣赏音乐的机会，能创作自己的歌剧，这在当时便有着重大和进步的意义。所以，1703年，十八岁的亨德尔便离开自己的故乡哈莱，到了当时德国最大的中心城市之一的汉堡。因为，十七世纪末这里便成立了一个公开的市立歌剧院，音乐生活开始走出封建宫廷的小天地，这是德国音乐生活的社会形式的萌芽。1704年亨德尔写了第一部清唱剧“约翰受难乐”，第二年，二十岁的亨德尔写了第一部歌剧“阿尔米拉”。歌剧的公演获得很大的成功。
    1706年亨德尔周游意大利各文化名城。在意大利，亨德尔透彻地学习了意大利正歌剧的写作方法和技巧。他写的歌剧“阿格里皮那”并被意大利人认可和欢迎。
    亨德尔创作的成熟时期居住在英国伦敦。在英国公演的第一部歌剧是“黎那尔多”。1720年起，亨德尔不倦地、顽强地进行歌剧创作。亨德尔一生写了四十部歌剧。
    正像在意大利旅行时期亨德尔努力地研究和学习意大利音乐文化一样，在侨居英国时期的亨德尔也热心地研究和学习英国的民间和专业音乐文化。亨德尔的手稿中便有伦敦街头和闹市的叫卖和喧嚷的声音的记录，亨德尔自己认为他的许多最好的歌曲便是从这些叫卖和喧嚷的音调中吸取了创作灵感的。
    伟大的文学艺术创作总是那个时代的人民的心声——内容上，描写人民的思想和愿望，形式上，为人民理解和喜爱。亨德尔在歌剧创作上是一直在企图克服意大利歌剧的美学原则上有局限性的一面——音乐和戏剧之间的相互脱节，以及歌唱孤立于整个戏剧甚至孤立于音乐之外的情况。而意大利歌剧美学原则上的好的一面则是它的真正的音乐性——气息宽广的、曲调流畅而宏丽的美声的艺术。当时的传统的歌剧题材是神话和历史传奇，而亨德尔的歌剧大多以历史英雄人物为主题，他加强了歌剧音乐的戏剧性和崇高的英雄性的因素，使戏剧性的场面力求完善地、鲜明地在音乐中表现出来。乐队的作用加强了，引入了前所未闻的合唱。但这一切，看来只是为他的后来的创作准备条件，晚年的亨德尔找到了最适合于他的思想和手法的形式——清唱剧。
    正像德国统一社会党中央在纪念亨德尔逝世二百周年纪念的文告中指出的：“从写作意大利歌剧转向清唱剧，这是亨德尔走向人民的重要的开始。”1738年，五十三岁的亨德尔写了两部清唱剧，这就是“扫罗”和“以色列人在埃及”。紧接着又写了“参孙”和“弥赛亚”。1745年写了“应时清唱剧”和清唱剧“犹大·麦克白”。这使作曲家获得了确定不移的荣誉——群众对他的创作的承认和欢迎。人道主义的民主理想是十八世纪先进思想家和艺术家的思想基础。他们深信人拥有取之不尽用之不竭的力量和才能，他们看到阻碍人的才能和力量的解放的封建制度应被消灭的历史发展的必然前途，他们的著作反映出人民对真理和正义的向往——科学的真理应该代替愚昧的宗教教义，社会的正义必然击退残酷的封建专制。
    在亨德尔的最伟大的作品中，特别是他晚年的清唱剧中，具体地表现了作曲家的这种人道主义的思想。“以色列人在埃及”这部清唱剧便描写了普通人民的命运和痛苦、欢乐和希望。人民从被奴役中被解放和他们解放后的欢乐便是这个作品的主题。
    是的，这个作品以及其他亨德尔的清唱剧都是取材于圣经的故事。但是，不能因为这些作品外面罩着一件宗教的袈裟而降低它的社会意义。正如德国统一社会党中央纪念亨德尔逝世二百周年的文告中指出的：“亨德尔在清唱剧中所采用的宗教题材，对当时的人民群众是亲切的……这种题材，正是他用以表达反封建专制的民族独立斗争要求和追求正义、和平生活的意愿的时代语言。”正像某些农民起义也打着宗教改革的旗号一样，这些具有宗教色彩的清唱剧所表达的思想内容和所运用的形式，也是符合当时资产阶级民主革命的准备，和开始时期的广大社会阶层的思想、情感和要求的。
    圣经故事只是譬喻和象征，重要的是故事所叙述的思想——反封建专制的民族独立斗争和追求正义、和平生活的意愿。所以，这些作品当然能为正向封建制度争取自由的作曲家的同代人所理解，这种反封建奴役的人道主义民主理想，也是我们今天仍然怀着崇敬的心情来欣赏，并能理解这些音乐作品的重要原因。
    亨德尔音乐创作的第一个特征是他的音乐的造型性。“以色列人在埃及”中便有许多如画的描写。人们说这部作品是一幅宏伟的、史诗的巨画。而这幅巨画又是以富有表现力的、鲜明而又纯朴的、基础于自然音体系的曲调来作为主要表现手段的。主题是以富有表现力的曲调为基础的，和声是朴实而清楚的，节奏是鲜明有力的，转调手法是单纯自然的，但这一切都显得宏伟和有力。正是由于作曲家对于未来社会的信念，即认为未来社会应该是一个理性和正义的王国的这种信念，才使作曲家对生活和客观世界的感受永远采取这种健康的态度。
    亨德尔音乐创作的第二个特点，是他的音乐的史诗性。英雄的主题和宏大的体裁便是最显著的特征。在他的所有的清唱剧中，合唱是他的主要手段之一。史诗的主角是人民，人民在清唱剧中便用合唱形式来表现。作曲家的宏伟的风格的形成，合唱形式的运用是构成这种风格的特征和原因之一。威严有力的合唱构成了宏大的史诗性的画面。正像罗曼·罗兰说的：“是没有个别的人的史诗”，在“以色列人在埃及”这部清唱剧里，便没有个别的人物和主角，人民是史诗的主角和英雄。
    亨德尔音乐创作的第三个特征是他的音乐的戏剧性。亨德尔另一部伟大的清唱剧“参孙”，可以说是这种戏剧性的清唱剧的代表，人们说：“以色列人在埃及”是作曲家的史诗性的清唱剧的典范。在“参孙”这部清唱剧里，作曲家用宣叙调、咏叹调、重唱来刻划剧情中的尖锐的戏剧冲突，来描写戏剧冲突中的人物性格。
    如画的造型性，宏伟的史诗性和描写的戏剧性，这就是亨德尔音乐创作上的现实主义的特征。
    亨德尔的音乐创作，使他成为音乐史上第一个具有广泛全欧意义、以至世界意义的德国作曲家。亨德尔是第一个创造性地继承、概括了德国、意大利、法国和英国的民间和专业音乐文化的成就，而集其大成并发扬光大的作曲家。亨德尔善于用音乐来表达他的人道主义民主理想的思想内容，并且也善于使用各种各样的表现手法来服从于自己的创作意志。作曲家的人道主义民主理想使他的音乐具有强烈的人民性。“假如我的音乐只能使人愉快，我很遗憾，我的目的是使人们高尚起来”，这就是作曲家的创作原则和美学信念——使人民摆脱奴役和愚昧，使人民品德高尚，创造未来的理性和正义主宰的社会。这就是古老的古典艺术为什么直到今天仍然具有无限的青春和魅力的根本原因。亨德尔的音乐作品之所以伟大，也就在于它在揭示当时的先进人类的美好理想的时候，总以乐观主义精神，鼓舞人们对理想的追求和对生活的信念。
