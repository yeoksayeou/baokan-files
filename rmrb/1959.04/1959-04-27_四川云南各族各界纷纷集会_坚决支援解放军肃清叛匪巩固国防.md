Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 26th: The shameless actions of imperialists and Indian expansionists in interfering in China's internal affairs have aroused immense anger among people of all ethnic groups and circles in Sichuan Province. In recent days, they have held gatherings one after another, issuing stern warnings to Indian expansionists and unanimously expressing their determination to fully support the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion and consolidating national defense.

    Suoren Kezun, Deputy Governor of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said: The so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" disseminated by Indian diplomatic officials attempts to reverse black and white in order to achieve the sinister goal of splitting our motherland. This is definitely not the Dalai Lama's original intention. Tibet is Chinese territory, and quelling the Tibetan rebellion is entirely our internal affair. Indian expansionists openly interfere in our internal affairs, support Tibetan traitors, and attempt to separate Tibet from the motherland. We Tibetan people, like the people of the whole country, will never agree to this. Jiang Panyun (Tibetan), Hu Jiande and others, workers at the Kangding Printing Factory, said angrily: Our autonomous prefecture is closely connected to Tibet. We must not sit idly by and ignore the criminal activities of the Tibetan traitorous group and Indian expansionists in splitting the motherland! We must fully support the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion. Jiangze, head of the People's Commune of Kangding suburbs, also warned: If Indian expansionists continue to be rampant, they will inevitably suffer the consequences!

    At a gathering of Tibetan students at the Southwest Nationalities College, many people also used their personal experiences to forcefully refute the various lies in the so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama." Li Suzhen, a Tibetan student from Tibet, said: The People's Liberation Army has always strictly abided by the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. The so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" is completely a reversal of black and white and a pack of lies. Tibet is an inseparable part of the motherland's territory. Without the motherland, the Tibetan people cannot obtain democracy, freedom, and happiness. Qumei Bazhen, a Tibetan student who won the title of model for supporting the Kangzang Highway, said: "This so-called statement imposed on the Dalai Lama by foreigners in an attempt to split the unity of the motherland is a great insult to the Tibetan people. I resolutely oppose it. Tibet will always be Chinese Tibet, and no one is allowed to split it!"

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 26th: Ethnic minority figures in Yunnan Province strongly warned against the interference of Indian expansionists in China's internal affairs, and paid tribute to the People's Liberation Army, which swept away the nest of Tibetan bandits in one fell swoop.

    Jifu (Tibetan), Deputy Governor of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and He Deshun (Tibetan), Deputy County Chief of Deqin County of the Autonomous Prefecture, cited historical facts about the flesh-and-blood relationship between Tibet and the motherland, and denounced the vicious claim by some people in India that "Tibet belongs to Tibetans and China belongs to Han people." They pointed out: This is not only to provoke the relationship between Tibet and the motherland and to find an excuse for the conspiracy of "Tibetan independence," but also to sow discord between various ethnic minorities and the motherland. Jifu said: India was a colony for a long time in the past and was enslaved by British imperialism. Now, some people in India also want to inherit and imitate British imperialism and covet our Tibet.

    Pai Qiren (Jingpo nationality), Deputy Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, was very angry at the unbridled and arrogant interference of Indian expansionists in China's internal affairs. He said: The People's Republic of China is a large family composed of all ethnic groups. Tibet is a part of the motherland's big family. Whether it is to quell the rebellion or carry out reforms, it is China's internal affair, and no one else is allowed to interfere or meddle in it. Who is not abiding by the Five Principles? Did some people in India interfere in China's Tibet, or did China interfere in a certain province of India? Their loud shouts can only damage their reputation in front of fair-minded people all over the world.

    Yu Haiqing (Yi nationality), County Chief of Ninglang Yi Autonomous County, said: In 1954, I was in Beijing and personally saw the warm welcome to the Dalai Lama. Many Buddhists burned incense and kowtowed to the Dalai Lama, and the facts shattered the slander that there was no respect for religion.

    Li Zhengcai (Nu nationality), Deputy Governor of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, said: Tibet is an inseparable part of our country, Tibetans are Chinese, and it is not allowed for a part of reactionary elements in India to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine Sino-Indian friendship.

    These people and Si Hongsheng (Dai nationality), Si Lasha (Jingpo nationality), Duo Yongan (Dai nationality), Deputy Governors of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and Duo Yingpei (Dai nationality), Shang Zigui (Jingpo nationality), Pu Jiadang (Jingpo nationality), Vice Chairmen of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all expressed in their speeches that they would strengthen national unity and support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions to completely quell the Tibetan rebellion, so that the motherland's borders would be more consolidated and the Tibetan people would be liberated sooner.

    四川云南各族各界纷纷集会
    坚决支援解放军肃清叛匪巩固国防
    新华社成都26日电　帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的无耻行为，激起四川省各族各界人民无比愤怒。连日来，他们纷纷集会，对印度扩张主义分子提出严厉的警告，一致表示要全力支援人民解放军彻底平息西藏叛乱，巩固国防。
    甘孜藏族自治州副州长所仁克尊说：印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”妄想颠倒黑白，达到分裂我们祖国的罪恶目的，这决不是达赖喇嘛的本意。西藏是我国领土，平息西藏叛乱完全是我国内政。印度扩张主义分子公然干涉我国内政，支持西藏叛国分子，企图把西藏从祖国分裂出去，我们藏族人民和全国人民一样，决不能答应。康定印刷工人姜攀云（藏族）、胡建德等愤怒地说：我们自治州与西藏紧紧相连，决不能对西藏叛国集团和印度扩张主义分子分裂祖国的罪恶活动坐视不顾！我们一定全力支援解放军彻底平定西藏叛乱。康定城郊乡民改社社长降泽还警告说：印度扩张主义分子假如要猖狂下去，他们必将自食其果！
    在西南民族学院藏族学员的集会上，许多人也以亲身经历有力地驳斥了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中的种种谎言。来自西藏地区的藏族学员李素珍说：人民解放军一直严格地遵守了和平解放西藏的十七条协议，所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”完全是颠倒黑白的胡言乱语。西藏是祖国领土不可分割的一部分，离开祖国，西藏人民不可能得到民主自由和幸福。曾获康藏公路支前模范称号的藏族学员曲梅巴珍说：“这个由外国人强加在达赖喇嘛身上的妄图分裂祖国统一的所谓声明，是对西藏人民的莫大侮辱，我坚决反对。西藏永远是中国的西藏，决不允许任何人分裂！
    新华社昆明26日电　云南省少数民族人士强烈警告印度扩张主义分子对我国内政的干涉，并向一举荡平西藏叛匪巢穴的解放军致敬。
    迪庆藏族自治州副州长吉福（藏族）和自治州德钦县副县长和德顺（藏族）列举历史上西藏和祖国的血肉关系的事实，痛斥印度某些人所谓“西藏是西藏人，中国是汉人”的恶毒说法。他们指出：这不仅是挑拨西藏和祖国的关系，为阴谋搞“西藏独立”找借口，而且是挑拨离间各个少数民族和祖国的关系。吉福说：印度过去长期沦为殖民地，受英帝国主义奴役。现在，印度某些人竟也想继承和效法英帝国主义，觊觎我们西藏来了。
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州副州长排启仁（景颇族）对印度扩张主义分子肆无忌惮狂妄干涉中国内政的行为十分愤怒。他说：中华人民共和国是各民族组成的大家庭。西藏是祖国大家庭的一部分。平息叛乱也好，进行改革也好，都是中国内政，不容他人干涉，不许他人染指。是谁不遵守五项原则？是印度某些人士干涉了中国的西藏，还是中国干涉了印度的某个省？他们大叫大喊，只能在全世界公正人士面前败坏自己的名声。
    宁蒗彝族自治县县长余海清（彝族）说：我1954年在北京，亲眼看到对达赖喇嘛的热烈欢迎，许多佛教徒向达赖焚香顶礼，事实就粉碎什么不尊重宗教的谰言。
    怒江傈僳族自治州副州长李政才（怒族）说：西藏是我国不可分割的一部分，西藏人是中国人，不能容许印度一部分反动分子干涉中国内政，破坏中印友谊。
    这些人和德宏傣族景颇族自治州副州长思鸿升（傣族）、司拉山（景颇族）、多永安（傣族），中国人民政协德宏傣族景颇族自治州委员会副主席多英培（傣族）、尚自贵（景颇族）、普戛当（景颇族）等人，都在发言中表示要加强民族团结，以实际行动支援解放大军彻底平定西藏叛乱，让祖国边疆更加巩固，让西藏人民早日得到翻身。
