Xinhua News Agency, April 17th dispatch from New Delhi: Following the Tibetan rebellion, many Indian people have written to newspapers expressing their views on the matter. Some of them, addressing the opinions in Indian public discourse that attempted to undermine Sino-Indian friendship and advocated interference in China's internal affairs, voiced differing opinions.

　　The "Times of India" published a letter on April 1st written by Daniel Latifi, a prominent lawyer from Mumbai. The letter stated that any rash intervention by India in the Tibetan rebellion "would violate Panchsheel (the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) and would raise dangerous issues. Relations between sovereign states are based on reciprocal treatment."

　　Another letter, published in the "Amrita Bazar Patrika" on April 2nd, said, "We Indians should be especially careful not to say anything impolite (if not harsh) to China, because the longest peaceful relationship exists between our country and China." The letter further stated, "When the vast majority of Asian and African countries have remained almost silent about the riots in Tibet, why should we say things that sound very similar to the typical arguments of those who oppose China?"

　　A reader's letter published in the "Indian Express" on April 1st disagreed with the defamatory remarks made by the newspaper about the Tibetan rebellion. It stated that the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion "has defended its territorial integrity, which is absolutely indispensable in its national interest."

　　The "Hindustan Times," which had clamored that "Tibet is dead," also had to publish a reader's letter on April 9th. The reader said: "In our country, some people are clamoring and making a great noise about the Tibetan event. As a result, people cannot see the real issues involved. It seems that some interested people are waiting for an opportunity to slander our great neighbor China, whose achievements have received praise even from unexpected quarters."

　　When discussing the true picture of the Tibetan rebellion, the letter pointed out that any bona fide government, in order to deal with the rebellion, could not but take the kind of action taken by the Chinese government. The letter expressed disagreement with certain individuals in India portraying the rebels as "martyrs" and China, which suppressed the rebellion, as an "aggressor."

　　印度人民写信给印度报纸
　　要求不干涉中国内政
    新华社17日讯　新德里消息：在西藏叛乱事件发生以后，有许多印度人士写信给报纸，表示他们对这件事的看法，其中有一些人针对印度舆论中那些企图破坏印中友好和主张干涉中国内政的言论，发表了不同的意见。
    “印度时报”在4月1日发表了孟买著名律师丹尼尔·拉蒂菲所写的一封信。这封信说，对于西藏叛乱事件，“印度如果进行任何轻率的干涉，都将违反潘查希拉（和平共处五项原则），并且将要引起危险的问题。主权国家之间的关系是以对等待遇为基础的。”
    另外一封在4月2日的“甘露市场报”上发表的信说，“我们印度人最好特别谨慎，不要对中国说什么不客气的话（如果说这些话还不是严厉的），因为我国和中国之间存在着最悠久的和平关系。”这封信又说，“当绝大多数亚非国家对于西藏的暴动都几乎保持沉默的时候，我们何必要讲那些听起来和那些反对中国的人们的典型说法很相似的话。”
    “印度快报”在4月1日发表的一封读者来信不同意这家报纸对西藏叛乱事件发表的诽谤性言论，它说，中国政府平定西藏叛乱，“已经保卫了它的领土完整，这在它的国家利益方面是非常不能缺少的。”
    曾经叫嚷说“西藏死亡了”的“印度斯坦时报”在4月9日也不得不刊登一封读者来信，这位读者说：“在我国有人就西藏事件大肆叫嚷，吵闹的结果是，人们看不见牵涉到的真正的问题。看来好像某些感兴趣的人们正在等待机会来中伤我们伟大的邻邦中国，而这个国家的成就所得到的赞扬甚至来自意料不到的方面”。
    这封信在谈到对西藏叛乱的真实情况的看法时指出，任何名副其实的政府为了对付叛乱，不可能不采取中国政府所采取的那种行动。这封信表示不同意印度的某些人士把叛乱分子描绘为“烈士”，而把镇压叛乱的中国描绘为“侵略者”。
