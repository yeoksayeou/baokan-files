    Farm Implement Factory Rushes to Produce Farm Tools
    A scene of intense and busy activity is evident everywhere in the farm implement manufacturing and distribution plant of the Sizao Commune in Dongtai County, Jiangsu. Workers are rushing to manufacture and repair a large number of farm tools to support spring plowing and production.
    As early as mid-February, the factory held a mobilization rally to pledge support for spring plowing and production. At the meeting, the factory Party committee called on all employees to use their brains and hands, to work hard and cleverly, and to support spring plowing and production. The workers wrote letters of proposal and determination, guaranteeing to: make whatever agriculture needs; and provide it whenever it is needed.
    After the meeting, an intense battle began. The workers of the second group of the farm implement specialty in the carpentry department changed from a single shift system to a rotating shift system, ensuring production day and night. The iron industry department lacked raw materials, so the workers melted scrap iron to replace whole iron. After improving their operating methods, the Xia Yongxing team of this department increased their daily production from four shovels to seven. Communist Party member Chun Guan of the carpentry workshop, through hard and clever work, successfully trial-produced a three-purpose cotton seeder. This seeder can ditch in front, drop seeds in the middle, and cover the seeds behind, improving work efficiency fourfold. The old factory director, Zhu Wenzhen, who is over fifty years old, also exerted great effort, working diligently with several worker comrades to successfully trial-produce a soil loosening tool that can loosen soil and weed, increasing work efficiency by more than double.
    At present, the factory has produced more than 5,600 large and small farm tools and repaired more than 1,800 various farm tools. The workers said heroically: "The battle drum of spring plowing and production sounds, heroes from all walks of life show their strengths. Peasant brothers are at the front line, and workers at the rear are busy day and night."

    农具厂赶制农具
    在江苏东台县四灶公社农具制配厂里，处处呈现出紧张、繁忙的景象。工人们正在赶制和修配大批农具，支援春耕生产。
    早在2月中旬，厂里就召开了支援春耕生产誓师动员大会。会上，厂党委号召全体职工，人人动脑，个个动手，苦干巧干，支援春耕生产。工人们纷纷写出倡议书和决心书，保证做到：农业上要什么，就造什么；什么时候要，就什么时候有。
    大会以后，一场紧张的战斗开始了。木业部农具专业第二组的工人们，将一班制改成轮班制，做到日夜生产。铁业部缺乏原料，工人们就熔化碎铁代替整铁。这个部的夏永兴小组，改进操作方法后，由每天打四把锹提高到七把。共产党员、木工房春官，在苦干巧干中，试制成功一架三用棉花播种机，用这种播种机播种棉花，前能打塘，中能丢种，后能盖种，提高工效四倍。五十多岁的老厂长朱文珍也发挥了干劲，同几个工人同志苦心钻研，试制成功一架能松土能锄草的松土器，使工效可以提高一倍以上。
    目前，这个厂已生产大小农具五千六百多件，修配各种农具一千八百多件。工人们豪迈地说：“春耕生产战鼓响，各路英雄齐逞强。农民兄弟上前线，工人后方日夜忙。”
