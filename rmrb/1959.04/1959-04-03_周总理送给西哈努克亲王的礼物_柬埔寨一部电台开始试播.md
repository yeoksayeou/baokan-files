Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 2nd – A medium-wave transmitter with a power of 20 kilowatts belonging to the Cambodian Royal Radio Station began test broadcasts at noon on the 1st. The operation of this transmitter, which was made in China, is very good.

This radio station is a gift from Premier Zhou Enlai to Prince Sihanouk. The radio station also includes a short-wave transmitter with a power of 15 kilowatts. The construction costs of the radio station were also provided by the Chinese government.

The person in charge of the radio station's construction project told Xinhua reporters on the 1st that the construction of this project was very fast. Construction of the radio station building began last October, and by mid-March of this year, all equipment, including a 20-kilowatt medium-wave transmitter, a 60-meter-high antenna tower, generators, and cooling equipment, had been installed.

He said that such achievements are inseparable from the close concern and support of the Cambodian King and government. Prince Sihanouk laid the first cornerstone for the radio station, and the Cambodian King and Queen visited the construction site. He also said that Cambodian workers, with the help of Chinese technicians, also made great efforts.

    周总理送给西哈努克亲王的礼物
    柬埔寨一部电台开始试播
    新华社金边2日电　柬埔寨皇家电台的一部功率为二十瓩的中波发射机在1日中午开始试播。中国制造的这个发射机的操作情况很好。
    这个电台是周恩来总理送给西哈努克亲王的礼物，这个电台还包括一部功率为十五瓩的短波发射机。电台的修建费也是中国政府提供的。
    电台建筑工程的负责人1日对新华社记者说，这个工程的建设速度是很快的。从去年10月开始建设电台的建筑物，到今年3月中旬，所有的设备，包括一部二十瓩的中波发射机、六十公尺高的天线塔、发电机和冷却设备全都安装好了。
    他说，这样的成绩是同柬埔寨国王和政府的密切关心和支持是分不开的。西哈努克亲王为电台奠下了第一块基石，柬埔寨国王和王后曾经参观了建筑工地。他又说，柬埔寨工人在中国技术人员帮助下也尽了很大的努力。
