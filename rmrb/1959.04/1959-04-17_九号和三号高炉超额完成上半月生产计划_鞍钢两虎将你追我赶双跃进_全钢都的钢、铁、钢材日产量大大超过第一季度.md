Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, April 16th: The utilization coefficient of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 blast furnace jumped to 2.088 in the first five days of mid-April, and created a new record of 2.212 on the 14th; that is to say, every cubic meter of the effective volume of the blast furnace produced 2.212 tons of iron in 24 hours.

The No. 9 blast furnace's competitor, the No. 3 blast furnace, also broke the "2" barrier for five days in the first half of April, closely following behind the No. 9 blast furnace with an average difference of 0.001. The two sides of the competition promoted each other and leaped forward together, both exceeding the production plan for the first half of the month.

In the past half month, the workers of the two blast furnaces launched a fierce "tug-of-war" style friendly competition. At the beginning of April, the workers of the No. 3 blast furnace challenged the workers of the No. 9 blast furnace. The equipment conditions of the No. 3 blast furnace are better than those of the No. 9 blast furnace, but its iron output has been lagging behind the No. 9 blast furnace for several months. The workers of the No. 9 blast furnace calmly responded to the challenge. They absorbed the experience of March and quickly organized a new and greater leap forward, with the goal of breaking through the "2" barrier. They adopted methods such as increasing blast temperature, reducing coke ratio, using less coke, and loading more ore, so that the blast furnace utilization coefficient jumped from 1.916 in March to 2.02 in the first week. The workers of the No. 3 blast furnace, in response to their weaknesses, strengthened unity, unified operations, improved the charging system, and eliminated hanging accidents, also increasing the blast furnace utilization coefficient from 1.745 in March to 1.942.

In the first round of the competition, although the No. 3 blast furnace did not catch up with the No. 9 blast furnace, it eliminated the long-standing hanging phenomenon, creating favorable conditions for continuing to leap forward and catch up with the No. 9 blast furnace. On the basis of smooth furnace conditions, they made full use of objective favorable conditions, increased air volume, and increased blast temperature, taking a two-pronged approach to increase smelting intensity and reduce coke ratio. On the 8th, they first reduced the coke ratio from 0.689 the previous day to 0.597, using 92 kilograms less coke per ton of iron smelted, and the blast furnace utilization coefficient on that day increased to 2.130; on the 10th, they continued to increase the air volume, increasing the smelting intensity from 1.323 the previous day to 1.346. At the end of the first ten days of April, the No. 9 blast furnace was overhauled according to plan, reducing the output of pig iron by more than 700 tons, so the average utilization coefficient of the No. 3 blast furnace in the first ten days of April reached 1.973, taking the lead over the No. 9 blast furnace.

After completing the overhaul task, the workers of the No. 9 blast furnace immediately rushed to catch up with the No. 3 blast furnace. While continuing to promote the experience of increasing blast temperature and reducing coke ratio, they strengthened the maintenance of the taphole, cherished every cubic meter of hot air, and adopted the method of sending more steam, so that the smelting intensity continued to increase, thereby loading 18 more batches of materials per day, increasing the production of pig iron by more than 50 tons per day. From the 11th to the 14th, the blast furnace utilization coefficient was maintained above "2" for four consecutive days, and reached 2.212 on the 14th; the average blast furnace utilization coefficient for the first five days of mid-April was 2.088. At this point, the No. 9 blast furnace caught up with the No. 3 blast furnace again.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, April 16th: The high-yield, high-quality red flag competition carried out by the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is in full swing, raising the output level of steel and steel products by a big step in the first half of April. Compared with the average daily output level in the first quarter, steel output increased by 1,100 tons, pig iron increased by 1,037 tons, and steel products increased by 1,182 tons.

Anshan Iron and Steel's production tasks in the second quarter are more arduous, with steel output planned to increase by about 28% compared with the actual output in the first quarter, pig iron output to increase by more than 30%, and steel products to increase by about 39%. In order to achieve this leap forward plan, the iron and steel forces of Anshan Iron and Steel are in high spirits, launching a massive high-yield, high-quality red flag competition with fiery enthusiasm, forming a upsurge of comparing indicators, comparing implementation measures, and comparing enthusiasm between factories and factories, mines and mines, workshops and workshops, and furnaces and furnaces. The workers of the sintering workshop of the Dong'anshan Mine quickly mastered the operating technology of the new equipment, increasing the daily output of sintered ore from more than 3,800 tons in March to more than 5,400 tons, preparing more "refined grains" for the blast furnace. Under the leadership of the workers of the No. 9 blast furnace and the No. 3 blast furnace, who are constantly creating high-yield records, the workers of the ironmaking plant quickly increased the daily pig iron output level, increasing iron production by an average of 394 tons per day in the first half of April compared with March. In terms of steelmaking, the workers on the famous Youth Solidarity Furnace increased the open hearth utilization coefficient from 9.81 in March to 11.85 in the first half of April. The workers on the Youth Friendship Furnace, the competitor of the Youth Solidarity Furnace, also increased the open hearth utilization coefficient to 11.83 during the same period. The workers of the First Blooming Mill broke the 10,000-ton daily rolling mark four times, and created a record of rolling 10,450 tons of steel ingots on April 3. The Second Medium Plate Mill, Welded Steel Pipe Plant, and Products Plant, three steel rolling plants, also continuously created high-yield records and overfulfilled the production plan for the first half of April.

Since entering the more arduous second quarter, the party and government leading cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel have always maintained a fighting attitude, closely grasping technical measures and the completion of production plans on a daily basis, which has played a great role in production.

　　九号和三号高炉超额完成上半月生产计划
　　鞍钢两虎将你追我赶双跃进
　　全钢都的钢、铁、钢材日产量大大超过第一季度
    新华社鞍山16日电　鞍钢九号高炉的利用系数在4月中旬头五天又跳到二点零八八，并且在14日创造了二点二一二的最新纪录；这就是说，每一立方公尺的高炉有效容积，在二十四小时之内炼出了二点二一二吨铁。
    九号高炉的竞赛对手三号高炉，在4月上半月有五天也突破了“二”的关，以平均零点零零一之差紧紧跟在九号高炉的后面。竞赛双方，互相促进，共同跃进，都超额完成了上半月的生产计划。
    半个月来，两座高炉的职工展开了一场激烈的“拉锯”式的友谊竞赛。4月一开始，三高炉职工就向九高炉职工挑战。三高炉的设备条件比九高炉好，可是几个月来铁产量一直落在九高炉的后面。九高炉的职工沉着应战。他们吸取3月份的经验，迅速组织新的更大跃进，目标是突破“二”的大关。他们采用提高风温，降低焦比，少用焦炭，多装矿石等办法，使高炉利用系数在第一周里就从3月份的一点九一六跃进到二点零二。三高炉职工针对自己的弱点，加强团结，统一操作，改进了装料制度，消灭了悬料事故，也把高炉利用系数从3月份的一点七四五提高到一点九四二。
    竞赛的第一个回合，三高炉虽然没赶上九高炉，可是却消灭了长期存在的悬料现象，为继续跃进赶上九高炉创造了有利条件。他们在炉况顺行的基础上，充分运用客观有利条件，加大风量，提高风温，从提高冶炼强度和降低焦比两个方面双管齐下。他们在8日首先把焦比从头一天的零点六八九降低到零点五九七，每炼一吨铁少用了九十二公斤焦炭，当天的高炉利用系数就提高到二点一三○；10日，接着加大风量，把冶炼强度又从前一天的一点三二三提高到一点三四六。4月上旬末，九高炉按计划进行检修，减产了七百多吨生铁，因此三高炉4月上旬的平均利用系数达到一点九七三，抢在九高炉的前面。
    九高炉的职工完成了检修任务之后，立即急起猛追三高炉。他们在继续推行提高风温和降低焦比经验的同时，加强维护出铁口，珍惜每一立方公尺的热风，并且采用了多送蒸汽的办法，使冶炼强度继续提高，从而每天多装十八批料，每天增产五十多吨生铁。从11日到14日，一连四天高炉利用系数都保持在“二”以上，14日还达到了二点二一二；4月中旬前五天的高炉利用系数，平均为二点零八八。至此，九高炉又赶在三高炉的前面。
    新华社鞍山16日电　鞍山钢铁公司职工开展的高产优质红旗竞赛如火如荼，在4月上半月把钢铁和钢材的产量水平提高了一大步。同第一季度的平均日产水平比较，钢产量增长了一千一百吨，生铁增长一千零三十七吨，钢材增长一千一百八十二吨。
    鞍钢第二季度的生产任务更加繁重，钢产量计划比第一季度实际产量增加28％左右，生铁产量要增加30％以上，钢材要增加39％左右。为实现这个跃进计划，鞍钢各路钢铁大军意气风发，以火热的干劲展开了声势浩大的高产优质红旗竞赛，形成了厂与厂、矿与矿、车间与车间、炉与炉之间互相比指标比实现措施和比干劲的热潮。东鞍山矿烧结车间的职工迅速掌握了新设备的操作技术，把烧结矿的日产量从3月份的三千八百多吨提高到五千四百多吨，为高炉准备了更多的“细粮”。炼铁厂职工在不断创造高产纪录的九高炉和三高炉职工的带动下，迅速地提高了生铁日产水平，4月上半月平均每天比3月份增产铁三百九十四吨。在炼钢方面，著名的青年团结炉上的职工，在4月上半月把平炉利用系数从3月份的九点八一提高到十一点八五。青年团结炉的竞赛对手——青年友谊炉上的职工，也在同时期之内把平炉利用系数提高到十一点八三。第一初轧厂的职工们，四破日轧万吨大关，并且在4月3日创造了轧钢锭一万零四百五十吨的纪录。第二中板厂、焊接钢管厂、制品厂等三个轧钢厂，也连创高产纪录，超额完成4月上半月生产计划。
    进入任务更加繁重的第二季度以来，鞍钢的党政领导干部，始终以战斗的姿态，紧紧地逐日抓技术措施，抓生产计划的完成情况，对生产起了很大作用。
