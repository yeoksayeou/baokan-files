　　Guizhou Automobile Factory Reforms Production Tools
　　Output Increases Five Hundred Times
　　Shanghai Qunxing Machinery Factory: One Person Skillfully Does the Work of Three
    
    (Our Newspaper) The oil seal group of the third parts workshop of the Guizhou Automobile Factory combined the original twenty processes for producing automobile parts - felt oil seals - into one, greatly increasing work efficiency and increasing product output by 552 times, saving 19 laborers and 10 lathes.
    
    Before the reform, most of the twenty manufacturing processes for felt oil seals were manual operations, and twenty workers could only produce 1,160 pieces per day. At the end of last year, when the workers were anxious, Feng Hui, a cadre following the production, exclaimed: "It would be great if several processes could be combined into one." This remark moved the production team leader Chi Yongming. He went back and thought about it all night, and finally came up with the idea of making a die to replace some manual operations with a punch press. The next day, he and the whole team of workers studied and manufactured it together. After several tests and improvements, the die finally replaced eight processes, greatly increasing output. This year, the output plan has been increased several times, and 150,000 oil seals must be completed in the first quarter, and they are national planned products. Therefore, in mid-February, the whole team of workers further studied and improved the die and came up with the "one die, multiple punching" method, which replaced ten processes and increased output by two and a half times. Just as everyone was celebrating the successful improvement, workers Liao Desong and Lan Yiqi suggested: "Wouldn't it be faster if we added a mold and made it a double mold for simultaneous punching?" This remark gave Chi Yongming a great inspiration. He thought: Since the die can replace ten processes, why can't it replace all the processes? The whole team of workers once again studied the process regulations, and workers Jiang Daomu, Jia Xinfu, and others also put forward many reasonable suggestions for improvement. Everyone was determined to change the original twenty processes into one. Chi Yongming worked with the veteran worker Wang Zhaoyun overnight to create a mold, and finally made a mold that could replace the original twenty processes.
    
    On March 22, as this mold was put into production, all nineteen processes, including lathe processing, were eliminated. The national plan for the first quarter was thus overfulfilled by 108%.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th (Report) The workers of the Shanghai Qunxing Machinery Manufacturing Factory, in rushing to produce 360 crushers, completed the workload of more than three people on average per person, and completed all the tasks five days ahead of schedule on the 10th of this month.

    This batch of crushers is for coal washing plants under tense construction in various places. According to the factory's original manufacturing capacity, it could only complete 40% of the task. The factory's leading cadres explained the significance, measures, and difficulties of completing this task to the workers and mobilized everyone to find solutions. The workers posted big-character posters, expressing their desire to improve production efficiency and do the work of three people. They also put forward many effective measures, ensuring that every team had innovations and every process had improvements. The small lathe team had to turn more than 1,400 screw caps, which would require more than 500 work hours. The workers rationally adjusted the labor organization, adopted a flow-line operation method, and improved the tools. As a result, it only took more than 100 work hours. The fitter team changed the method of processing pins from filing to milling, increasing production efficiency by thirty times.

    In the process of manufacturing this batch of crushers, the factory's leading cadres went deep into the workshops and teams to grasp the weak links and solve problems at any time. For example, one part of the crusher originally took two shifts to turn one, which could not keep up with the requirements of the planned progress. After the factory's party branch secretary went to the workshop, he immediately studied with the veteran workers and workshop cadres and promoted the whirlwind cutting method, which greatly accelerated the processing speed, and sixteen could be turned in one shift.

　　贵州汽车制造厂改革生产工具
　　产量提高五百倍
　　上海群星机械厂一人巧干三人活
    本报讯　贵州汽车制造厂第三配件车间油封组，把原来生产汽车配件——毛毡油封的二十道工序合成一道，大大提高了工效，使产品产量提高五百五十二倍，还节约了劳动力十九人、车床十台。
    在没有进行改革以前，毛毡油封的二十道制造工艺大部分是手工操作，二十个工人每天只能生产一千一百六十只。去年年底，正在工人们着急的时候，跟班生产的干部冯惠感叹地说：“要是能把几道工序合成一道就好了。”这句话使生产组长池永铭心里一动，回去考虑了一夜，终于想出了做一个冲模，用冲床代替一些手工操作的办法。第二天，就和全组工人一起研究制造。经过几次试验改进，终于使冲模代替了八道工序，使产量大大提高。今年，产量计划又翻了几番，一季度就要完成十五万只油封，并且是全国性的计划产品，必须完成。于是，在2月中旬全组工人又进一步研究改进了冲模，并且想出了“一模多冲”的办法，使它代替了十道工序，提高产量两倍半。就在大家庆贺改进成功的时候，工人廖德松，兰以奇建议说：“要是加一个模子，搞成双模并冲，那不是更快吗？”这句话给池永铭又是个很大的启发。他想：冲模既然能代替十道工序，为什么不能叫它代替所有的工序呢。全组工人又一次研究了工艺规程，工人蒋道穆、贾新福等，还提出了很多改进的合理化建议，大家决心要把原来的二十道工序改成一道。池永铭就连夜和王肇云老师傅一起创造模具，终于做好一种能代替原来的二十道工序的模具。
    3月22日，随着这种模具投入生产，连车床加工在内的十九道工序全部取消了。一季度国家计划因此超额108％胜利完成。
    新华社上海13日电　上海市群星机械制造厂的工人，在赶制三百六十台破碎机中，平均每个人完成了三个多人的工作量，并且提前五天在本月10日完成了全部任务。
    这一批破碎机是供应各地正在紧张建设中的洗煤工厂用的。按照这个工厂原有的制造能力，只能够完成40％的任务。工厂的领导干部就把完成这一任务的意义、措施和困难都向工人讲清楚，发动大家想办法。工人们纷纷贴出大字报，表示要提高生产效率，一个人干三个人的活。他们还提出了许多有效措施，做到了每个小组都有革新，道道工序都有改进。小车床小组要车一千四百多只螺丝帽，一共需要五百多个工时，工人们合理调整了劳动组织，采取流水作业法，改进了刀具后，结果只花了一百多个工时，钳工小组把加工梢子的方法由锉改为铣，生产效率提高了三十倍。
    在制造这批破碎机的过程中，这个工厂的领导干部都分头深入车间、小组，抓薄弱环节，发现问题随时解决。比如破碎机上的一个零件，原来两班才能车一个，赶不上计划进度的要求。工厂党支部书记下车间以后，立即和老工人、车间干部共同研究，推广了旋风切削法，使加工速度大大加快，一班就能车十六个。
