　　Good Maintenance of All Highways
　　Significant Results in Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Henan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Other Places
    (Our report) In order to meet the ever-increasing transportation needs, highway maintenance and construction workers across the country are actively carrying out technical upgrades to many highway trunk lines and highways leading to industrial and mining smelting bases.

    The Qianyang Highway Bureau in Hunan Province mobilized more than 1,000 road maintenance workers and civilians in the entire district. After more than 60 days of hard work, they eliminated 72 major sharp bends and steep slopes on the highways in the entire district. Six of the seven ferries in the district were improved by building temporary bridges and connecting boats, allowing car trains to pass unimpeded. The Transportation Bureau of the Fu'an Special District in Fujian Province launched large-scale work to straighten and level bends and steep slopes to improve roads leading to mining areas, iron smelting furnace clusters, and heavy traffic. The Fu'an-Fuding line, which originally could not be used by car trains, has been improved, and many single-trailer car trains are now running on it, with a daily mileage of 360 kilometers, and the speed is about 40% higher than in the past. The coal mine transportation route from Yishan Sancha to Daqing in Liucheng, Guangxi, under the leadership of the local party and government, mobilized more than 800 civilians and transferred miners. After more than ten days of emergency work to change bends, reduce slopes, reinforce bridges and culverts, and build pontoon bridges, the entire line can now implement multi-trailer transportation.

    By the end of last year, the mileage of highways that could be used in sunny and rainy weather across the country had reached about 200,000 kilometers. In the fourth quarter of last year, Henan Province launched a large-scale mass road construction campaign, paving nearly 6,000 kilometers of dirt roads with gravel or brick ballast, achieving unobstructed traffic in sunny and rainy weather.

    In order to allow car trains to cross quickly, Guangdong Province has also created a method of connecting two or three ferries and using steamships to push them across. This experience is being widely promoted. The Chao'an ferry in this province can carry seven cars at a time by connecting two boats. The Tingzi ferry in Nanning, Guangxi, uses this method to transport 12 to 18 cars at a time. All highway ferries in Fujian Province have eliminated the phenomenon of waiting in line for ferries. Guangdong, Sichuan, Guangxi and other places are also vigorously rebuilding bridges. Guangxi rebuilt six bridges and ten temporary bridges or pontoon bridges last year. Guangdong Province plans to rebuild bridges on a large scale this year in order to better improve the transportation efficiency of car trains.

　　条条公路养护好
　　湖南、福建、广东、河南、四川、广西等地效果显著
    本报讯　为了适应运输任务不断增长的需要，全国公路养护与修建职工，正在对很多公路干线和通往工矿冶炼基地的公路积极进行技术改造。
    湖南省黔阳公路局，发动全区养路工人和民工一千多人，经过六十多天的奋战，消灭了全区公路上的七十二处主要急弯陡坡；全区七处渡口，用搭便桥、连船渡等方法改善了六处，从而使汽车列车通行无阻。福建省福安专署交通局为改善通往矿区、炼铁炉群和运输繁重的公路，对弯路和陡坡展开了大规模的改直削平工作。原来不能行驶汽车列车的福安至福鼎线，经改善后，已有不少单挂的汽车列车通行，日行里程达到三百六十公里，车速比过去提高40％左右。广西宜山三岔至柳城大青的煤矿运输路线，在当地党政领导下，发动民工、抽调矿工共八百多人，经十多天的突击改弯降坡、加固桥涵、修建浮桥，使全线都可以实行一车多挂运输。
    到去年年底，全国晴天下雨都能通车的公路里程已达二十万公里左右。河南省去年四季度开展了大规模的群众修路运动，把近六千公里的土路加铺了石子或改为砖碴路面，达到晴雨通车无阻。
    为了使汽车列车过渡迅速，广东省还创造了把两三只渡船连接起来，用汽船顶推过渡的办法。这个经验正在普遍推广。这个省的潮安渡口用两船连渡每次可渡七辆车。广西南宁工区亭子渡口采用这个办法，一次可渡运汽车十二到十八辆。福建省的公路渡口全部消灭了停车待渡现象。广东、四川、广西等地，还大力改建桥梁。广西去年一年内就改建桥梁六座，改建便桥或浮桥十座。广东省今年准备大规模地改建桥梁，以便更好地提高汽车列车的运输效率。
