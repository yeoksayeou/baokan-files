Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: The inspection work of the National People's Congress representatives and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) members in various regions has concluded.

	For nearly a month, people's representatives and CPPCC members have been divided into groups to inspect grassroots units such as industrial and agricultural production and people's communes in various regions. The representatives and members went deep into the fields to inspect the growth of grain, cotton, and other crops, and inspected the management of people's communes and collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly. The representatives and members also inspected the steel, coal, machinery, and other industries in Anshan Iron and Steel, Shanghai, Fushun, Fuxin, and other places, as well as grassroots units such as schools, scientific research institutions, shops, and streets. During the inspection, the representatives and members extensively contacted the people and listened to their opinions on various tasks.

	The representatives and members were deeply moved by the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the revolutionary spirit of the people in various regions. People's Representatives Liang Sicheng, Lei Jieqiong, and others conducted inspections in Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, and other places. They believe that as a result of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the communization of the people in Guangdong Province last year, the material and cultural living standards of the people have generally improved. They cited the example of a poor peasant family in Nada People's Commune in Danxian County. The family of four, with two elderly and weak laborers, had a total income of 350 yuan in 1957, which increased to 450 yuan in 1958. The representatives and members were very excited about the benefits that the people's commune has brought to the peasants. In Zhuzhou, a newly emerging industrial city in Hunan, the people's representatives and CPPCC members saw newly built factory buildings standing everywhere, and many factories started from scratch and created a large amount of wealth for the country. The representatives and members said that they vividly and specifically saw the great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction in this inspection. Gu Jiegang, a 66-year-old CPPCC member, was not feeling well during the inspection, but he still climbed to the fifth floor of the Zhuzhou Coal Preparation Plant, which is under construction, to inspect it with everyone. This plant can prepare 1.8 million tons of coal a year after it is completed. Gu Jiegang said that such a large construction scale was something he had never imagined in the past. People's Representatives and CPPCC members Zhang Tianfang, Dao Jingban (Dai ethnic group), Gong Shou (Dai ethnic group), Song Mou (Tibetan ethnic group), Lei Chunguo (Jingpo ethnic group), Hu Zhonghua (Kawa ethnic group), and Li Chengxiang (Hani ethnic group) conducted inspections in the Kunming area. In a forum after the inspection, they said that they were overwhelmed by the new things that emerged in Yunnan Province during the Great Leap Forward. They cited the Liaoyuan Iron Plant as an example, saying that the utilization coefficient of the small blast furnace in this plant, which was established by rural cadres and farmers in October last year, has increased from 0.4 to 1.08, and the technical and management capabilities of workers and cadres have been greatly improved. This factory has not only paid off its bank loans, but also built more than 10,000 square meters of workshops and other buildings by itself. The representatives said: "In the Liaoyuan Iron Plant, we saw the scene of the working people being masters of their own affairs and building their homes."

	During the inspection, the representatives and members also put forward many constructive opinions on the work in various places. CPPCC member Wu Jue Nong, who inspected Fujian Province, believes that the Da Bai Yun tea in eastern Fujian is selling well at home and abroad and should be vigorously cultivated. Representative Xie Nanguang suggested that Fujian Province should strengthen the shipbuilding industry. The representatives and members who inspected Shanghai suggested that factories should further tap the potential of production equipment, save raw materials, improve product quality, summarize production experience, and accelerate the training of new workers. The representatives and members who inspected universities and colleges also put forward many suggestions for improvement on how universities and colleges can further give play to the enthusiasm of teachers, carry out academic discussions, comprehensively arrange teaching, scientific research, and production labor and rest time, and better implement the Party's education policy and certain teaching regulations.

	The people's committees in various regions attached great importance to the criticisms and suggestions of the representatives and members. The responsible persons of the people's committees of various provinces and cities and various grassroots units held forums to listen to the criticisms and suggestions of the representatives and members, and immediately took measures to solve some problems that could be solved.

　　深入基层广泛接触人民群众听取意见
　　人大代表和政协委员视察工作结束
    新华社15日讯　全国人民代表大会代表、政协全国委员会委员在各地的视察工作已经结束。
    人民代表和政协委员们将近一个月来分组到各地视察了工农业生产以及人民公社等基层单位。代表和委员们深入田间视察了粮、棉等农作物的生长情况，视察了人民公社的管理工作和公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院等集体福利事业。代表和委员们还视察了鞍钢、上海、抚顺、阜新等地的钢铁、煤、机械和其他工业的情况，以及学校、科学研究机构、商店、街道等基层单位。代表和委员们在视察中同人民群众广泛进行了接触，听取了群众对各项工作的意见。
    代表和委员们在视察中看到了各地工农业生产大跃进的伟大成就和人民群众的革命干劲，都深为感动。人民代表梁思成、雷洁琼等在广东省海南岛等地进行了视察。他们认为，广东省去年工农业生产大跃进和人民公社化的结果，人民的物质和文化生活水平普遍有了提高。他们举出儋县那大人民公社的一户原来的贫农为例，这户贫农一家四人中有两个老弱劳动力，1957年全家收入三百五十元，1958年增到四百五十元。代表和委员们对人民公社化为农民带来的好处非常兴奋。在湖南视察的人民代表和政协委员们，在新兴的工业城市——株洲看到新建的工厂厂房遍地矗立，许多工厂白手起家、从无到有，为国家创造了大量财富。代表和委员们都说他们在这次视察中生动而具体地看到了党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利。六十六岁的政协委员顾颉刚在视察中身体不好，但他还是和大家一起爬上正在建设中的株洲选煤厂的第五层楼上察看。这个厂建成后一年可以选煤一百八十万吨，顾颉刚表示，这样大的建设规模，是他过去所没有想到的。人民代表和政协委员张天放、刀京版（傣族）、龚绶（傣族）、松谋（藏族）、雷春国（景颇族）、胡忠华（佧佤族）、李呈祥（哈尼族）等在昆明地区进行了视察。他们在视察结束以后的座谈会上说，云南省在大跃进中涌现出来的新事物使他们到处应接不暇。他们举出燎原铁厂为例说，这个去年10月由农村干部和农民办起来的厂，小高炉利用系数已由零点四提高到一点零八，工人和干部们的技术和管理能力都有了很大提高。这个工厂现在不仅还掉银行的贷款，还自己建设了一万多平方公尺的车间等建筑物。代表们说：“在燎原铁厂看到了劳动人民当家作主、兴家立业的景象。”
      代表和委员们在视察中还对各地的工作提出了许多建设性的意见。在福建省视察的吴觉农委员认为闽东的大白云茶畅销国内外，应该大力加以培植。谢南光代表建议福建省加强造船工业。在上海视察的代表和委员们，建议各工厂要进一步发挥生产设备的潜力、节约原材料、提高产品质量、总结生产经验、加速培养新工人；视察高等学校的代表和委员们，对各高等学校进一步发挥教师的积极性，开展学术讨论，全面安排教学、科学研究和生产劳动以后休息的时间，更好地贯彻党的教育方针和教学上某些规章制度也提出了许多改进意见。
    各地人民委员会对代表和委员们的批评建议十分重视。各省、市人民委员会和各基层单位的负责人都举行了座谈会听取代表和委员们的批评建议，并且对一些能够解决的问题立即采取措施进行解决。
