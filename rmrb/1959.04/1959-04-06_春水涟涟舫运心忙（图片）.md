    Spring Waters Ripple, Boat Transportation is Busily Minded
    The spring flood season has arrived, and inland river transportation in Hebei Province is becoming busier day by day. In the first quarter of this year, the inland river transportation volume in Hebei Province increased by one and a half times compared with the same period last year. Shipping workers are also trying every possible means to improve the utilization rate of ships, to transport more daily necessities to rural areas, and a large amount of agricultural products to cities, to ensure that the transportation task in the second quarter is three times greater than that in the first quarter.

    春水涟涟舫运心忙
    春汛已到，河北省内河航运一天比一天繁忙，今年第一季度里，河北省的内河航运量比去年同期增加了一倍半。航运职工还在千方百计提高船舶利用率，要把更多的日用品运往农村，大量农产品运到城市，保证第二季度里完成比第一季度增加三倍运量的运输任务。
