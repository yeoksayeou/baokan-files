Xinhua News Agency, April 15th, New Delhi Dispatch: Leaders of some political parties in India, such as the Praja Socialist Party, have recently been making waves by exploiting the Tibetan rebellion incident, wantonly slandering China, and attempting to stir up anti-China sentiment among the Indian people, thereby sabotaging the friendly relations between China and India.

According to a report by the Indian Press Trust on April 13, most leaders of the Praja Socialist Party believe that the Tibetan rebellion is a so-called "national struggle against Chinese colonialism." They say that the Colombo powers should "feel indignant at the barbaric practice of the Chinese incorporating Tibet into the Chinese Communist Empire." These people are clamoring for the Indian government to convene a conference of Colombo powers to "discuss" the Tibet issue.

After careful preparation and advance fanfare, this party held a so-called "Tibet Day" rally in Delhi on March 29, but only a handful of people participated in the rally.

The party's General Secretary and Member of Parliament, Goray, shouted at the meeting, urging Indians to "beware of China's expansionist imperialism," and claimed that "all communist governments are imperialist." This is the same Goray who once issued a statement saying, "It seems that Tibet is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the communist python."

On the same day, another leader of the party, Mehta, presided over the so-called "Tibet Day" rally in Bombay, and even said that "the relationship between India and Tibet is like that of a mother and son." He asked, "When a son is attacked, can a mother remain a silent bystander?" He said, "It is wrong to regard the Tibet issue entirely as China's internal affair." "The Tibet issue is a matter of flesh and blood affecting India." He said, "The characteristics of a nation cannot be deprived in the name of internal affairs." He also provoked further, describing the quelling of the Tibetan rebellion by our People's Liberation Army as a threat to neighboring countries. He said, "Today it is Tibet's turn, tomorrow it may be Nepal's turn, and the day after tomorrow it may be our turn." At the so-called "Support Tibet Committee" meeting held on April 1, Mehta also attacked Prime Minister Nehru for "not fully expressing the views of the Indian people," and he said that "India should not be influenced by possible reactions from Moscow and Beijing."

Leaders of the Praja Socialist Party and certain other political parties also convened a "public gathering" in Delhi on April 4. Praja Socialist Party leader Kripalani distorted the Tibetan rebellion incident at the meeting as "the independent existence of a small, peaceful, and unassuming country being threatened by a large country, a country driven by greed." Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, threatened the audience at the meeting, saying, "If Tibet is no longer an independent country and is annexed by China, it will endanger the independence of India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim." At this meeting, they also passed a "resolution" that blatantly expressed support for the Tibetan rebels. It said, "They (referring to the Tibetan rebels) can forever rely on India's sympathy, goodwill, and assistance to carry out their struggle."

Prior to this, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, also led some people in front of the Chinese Embassy in Delhi on March 30, shouting reactionary slogans such as "Down with Communist Imperialism." At that moment, the weather turned unfavorable, and it suddenly started raining, causing these people to run away in disarray.

Members of these political parties have also repeatedly raised temporary motions in Parliament, requesting discussions on the so-called "Tibetan turmoil issue." Mehta clamored during the People's Assembly debate on foreign affairs that "the events in Tibet" cannot be "ignored." He said that India's policy of friendship with China cannot be "bought at the expense of the legitimate demands of the Tibetan people for internal autonomy and cultural freedom." Vajpayee also clamored in the People's Assembly that "the relationship between India and China should be re-examined based on what is happening in Tibet."

The actions of these people who deliberately undermine Indian-Chinese friendship have not received sympathy and support among the vast majority of the Indian people, but have been condemned by progressive Indian public opinion. "The United Paper" said on April 7: "Some people are beginning to use the Tibet issue to attack the Panchsheel principles (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence), incite anti-Indian foreign policy sentiment, and set China and India against each other. In fact, these people are singing the tune of the American reactionaries, who are strongly opposed to our foreign policy and hope to see us change this policy." "The National Herald" said that the frantic anti-communism of the Mehta and his ilk has made them lose their ability to judge the policies and actions of socialist countries. "The People's Power Paper" said that pro-American factions in Parliament are cleverly trying to use China's internal affairs to trick India into the Cold War camp.

Calcutta's "Epoch-Making Times" sharply criticized those who want to undermine the friendship between India and China on April 1, saying that their sabotage is aimed at isolating India internationally and ultimately forcing it to rely on American weapons and military aid. The newspaper said that behind the Tibet issue lies the conspiracy of imperialists and greedy colonialists who are trying to make India lose China's friendship and support and end India's neutrality.

A commentary in the "New Century" weekly stated that leaders of the Praja Socialist Party, such as Mehta, are warriors of the American "China Lobby." "Well-known American 'friends' are desperately using these critical days to get the Indian government to change its policy towards People's China and make India a spiritual and political base for the worldwide reactionary imperialist propaganda movement."

    印度人民社会党等一些政党领导人
    利用西藏叛乱　恶毒诬蔑我国
    妄图煽起反华情绪破坏中印友好关系
    新华社15日讯　新德里消息：印度人民社会党等一些政党的领导人最近利用西藏叛乱事件兴风作浪，大肆污蔑中国，妄图在印度人民中煽起反对中国的情绪，破坏中国和印度的友好关系。
    据印度报业托辣斯4月13日报道，人民社会党的大多数领袖认为，西藏叛乱事件是所谓“对中国殖民主义进行的民族斗争”。他们说，科伦坡国家要“对中国人把西藏吞并入中国共产党帝国的野蛮做法感到愤怒”。这些人正在吵嚷着要印度政府召开科伦坡国家会议来“讨论”西藏问题。
    这个政党经过了周密准备和事先吹擂了一番之后，3月29日在德里搞了一个所谓“西藏日”的集会，但是只有寥寥无几的一些人参加了这次集会。
    这个党的总书记、议员戈拉伊在会上叫喊，要印度人“小心提防中国的扩张帝国主义”，他说什么“所有的共产党政府都是帝国主义”。就是这个戈拉伊曾经发表声明，说“看来西藏正在同共产主义大蟒进行生死斗争”。
    在同一天，这个党的另一名领导人梅达在孟买主持所谓“西藏日”的集会时，居然说什么“印度和西藏的关系是母子关系”。他问道：“当儿子被攻击时，母亲能够做一个不声不响的旁观者吗？”他说“把西藏问题完全看作是中国的内政，那是错误的。”“西藏问题是影响印度的血肉的问题。”他说“不能允许以内政的名义来剥夺民族的特性”。他还大肆挑拨，把我人民解放军平定西藏叛乱说成是对邻国的威胁。他说，“今天轮到西藏，明天也许会轮到尼泊尔，后天也许会轮到我们。”梅达还在4月1日举行的所谓“支援西藏委员会”的集会上攻击尼赫鲁总理“没有充分表达印度人的看法”，他还说“印度不应当被来自莫斯科和北京的可能的反应所影响”。
    人民社会党等某些政党的领导人还在4月4日在德里召集了一次“公众集会”。人民社会党领袖克里帕拉尼在会上把西藏叛乱事件歪曲为“一个小的、和平的和不惹人的国家的独立生存受到一个大国、一个利欲熏心的国家的威胁”。印度人民同盟领袖瓦吉帕伊在会上恐吓听众说，“假如西藏不再是一个独立的国家，被中国并吞了，它就将危及印度、尼泊尔、不丹和锡金的独立。”他们在这次会议上还通过“决议”，露骨地对西藏叛匪表示支持。它说，“他们（指西藏叛匪）可以永远依靠印度的同情、亲善和帮助来进行他们的斗争”。
    在此之前，印度人民同盟的领导人瓦吉帕伊还曾经在3月30日带领了一些人在中国驻德里大使馆门前，叫喊“打倒共产帝国主义”等反动口号，这时天公不作美，突然下起雨来，害得这些人混乱地跑光了。
    这些政党的议员还在议会上一再提出临时动议，要求讨论所谓“西藏骚乱问题”。梅达在人民院辩论外交工作时，就叫嚷对“西藏发生的事态”不能“置之不理”。他说什么印度对中国友好的政策不能以“牺牲西藏人民要求内政自治的合法要求和文化自由的代价来购买”。瓦吉帕伊也在人民院上叫嚷“印度和中国的关系应该根据西藏发生的事情重新加以审查”。
    这些蓄意破坏印中友好的人们的所作所为在绝大多数印度人民中得不到同情和支持反而遭到了印度进步舆论的谴责。“团结报”4月7日说：“某些人开始利用西藏问题攻击潘查希拉的原则（和平共处五项原则）、煽动反对印度外交政策的情绪并且使中国和印度互相反对。实际上，这些人唱的调子是美国反动派的调子，美国反动派是极力反对我们的外交政策的，并且希望看到我们改变这个政策。”“国民先驱报”说梅达之流疯狂反共使他们对社会主义国家的政策和行动失去判断力。“人民力量报”说议会的亲美派正在巧妙地想利用中国的内政把印度诱骗入冷战阵营中去。
    加尔各答的“划时代报”4月1日尖锐地抨击那些想破坏印度和中国友好的人，说他们这种破坏是为了使印度在国际范围内处于孤立，并且最终不得不依靠美国武器和军事援助。这家报纸说，西藏问题的幕后隐藏着帝国主义者和贪婪的殖民主义者的阴谋，他们企图使印度失掉中国的友谊和支持并且结束印度中立的。
    “新世纪”周刊的评论说，人民社会党的领导人，如梅达，是美国“院外援华集团”的战士。“闻名的美国‘朋友’拼命利用这些危急的日子，要使印度政府改变它对人民中国的政策，并且使印度成为全世界反动的帝国主义宣传运动的精神上和政治上的基地。”
