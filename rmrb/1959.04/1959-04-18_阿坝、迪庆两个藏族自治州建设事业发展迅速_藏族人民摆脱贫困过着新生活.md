Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 16th - Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province has seen its total grain output increase nearly twofold and its livestock increase by more than 400,000 head in recent years. Furthermore, it has established more than 1,900 small and medium-sized factories from scratch. This has fundamentally changed the poverty-stricken and backward situation of the entire prefecture, and the Tibetan people have begun to live a happy life of abundance.

　　Before liberation, agricultural and pastoral production in this area remained in a primitive state. In many places, yaks were still used for plowing, and seeds were sown under the "bai long" method (a primitive planting method), with grain yields of only fifty or sixty jin per mu. In terms of industry, there was absolutely nothing; even a single nail had to be transported from elsewhere. Coupled with internal disunity among the ethnic groups, frequent infighting made it impossible for many people to make a living and forced them to beg for survival. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the Tibetan people here engaged in mutual aid production, built water conservancy projects, and gradually changed backward farming methods. In the past two years, they have launched a mass movement for tool reform and technological innovation, changing the outdated rules and customs and backward technologies that hindered production. Even some areas with high mountains and rapid rivers have achieved cart transportation and cableway transport. Last year, the irrigated area of the entire prefecture reached more than 150,000 mu, which is twice the area irrigated over thousands of years before liberation. More than 10,000 mu of sloping land in the prefecture have been converted into terraced fields, and more than 50,000 mu of farmland have been improved. The total grain output of the prefecture increased by nearly 50% compared to 1957 and doubled compared to before liberation. Calculated per agricultural capita, the average person has 1,000 jin of grain. Animal husbandry has also greatly developed in the prefecture, with more than 80% of herdsmen joining pastoral cooperatives, and the total number of livestock has increased by more than 400,000 head compared to before liberation.

　　In terms of industry, many industrial sectors focusing on iron and steel and machinery have been established. Now, every county in the prefecture has iron factories that mainly produce agricultural tools, as well as various processing plants for food, brewing, etc. Chemical plants distributed throughout the region produce large quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This has not only promoted local production and facilitated the lives of the Tibetan people but has also increased the income of Tibetan farmers.

　　The cultural and educational undertakings of the autonomous prefecture have also greatly developed. At present, eleven secondary schools and five hundred and fifty-nine primary schools have been established in the prefecture, with the number of schools increasing nearly threefold and the number of enrolled students increasing nearly twentyfold compared to 1950. In addition, there are more than one hundred and ninety medical institutions and many cinemas, film projection teams, cultural centers, and rural clubs throughout the prefecture.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 17th - Since the implementation of regional autonomy, Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province has achieved rapid development in socialist construction, and the Tibetan people have entered a new historical period in terms of political, economic, and cultural life.

　　This autonomous prefecture is located on the plateau in northwestern Yunnan Province, where nearly 100,000 Tibetan people live. After liberation, the Party and the government led the Tibetan people here to develop agricultural production. By 1957, the average yield per mu of highland barley and miscellaneous grains in the entire region had doubled, increasing from over one hundred jin to over two hundred and fifty jin. After the establishment of the autonomous prefecture in 1957, democratic reforms were implemented based on the demands of the vast majority of the people and with the consent of Tibetan upper-class figures. Currently, five people's communes, thirty-eight advanced cooperatives, and two elementary cooperatives have been established in the autonomous prefecture, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for more than 97% of the total number of households. Last year, the total grain output of the prefecture increased from more than 50 million jin in 1957 to more than 70 million jin, with the increased portion being equivalent to the total grain output of the entire prefecture in the early days of liberation.

　　In practice, the entire prefecture has cultivated and trained a large number of Tibetan cadres. Among the members of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Working Committee of the CPC, there are Tibetan Communist Party members in charge of cadre affairs. Many Tibetan cadres also hold key leadership positions in counties, districts, people's communes, and cooperatives. These cadres can closely connect with the Tibetan masses, becoming the core force for uniting the broad masses of Tibetan people to develop production, consolidate cooperative organizations, and correctly implement the Party's ethnic and religious policies.

　　In the past, agricultural production here was very backward, and poor peasants generally used wooden sticks to cultivate the land. After liberation, people invited several blacksmiths from Han Chinese areas to build two blacksmith furnaces to manufacture agricultural tools. Currently, these two furnaces have developed into a rudimentary machinery factory. This year, Tibetan farmers are not only using hoes and iron plows for production, but also have a variety of light and new-style walking plows. Recently, tractors have also appeared on the grasslands. The autonomous prefecture now not only has machinery factories and agricultural tool factories but also has power generation, wool spinning, and leather factories. The number of Tibetan workers has reached more than 1,000.

　　With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the lives of the Tibetan people have also greatly improved. In the past, poor peasants often could not eat buttered tea even once every six months. Now, most people can eat a certain amount of butter, salt, and tea every day. In the past, most Tibetan people had never worn cotton cloth, and many people could not even afford a complete linen garment. Since last year, cotton cloth has been a common clothing material for the Tibetan people here, and every household has blankets, cotton blankets, and felts.

　　The cultural, educational, and health undertakings of the autonomous prefecture have also greatly developed.

　　阿坝、迪庆两个藏族自治州建设事业发展迅速
　　藏族人民摆脱贫困过着新生活
    新华社成都16日电　四川省阿坝藏族自治州在中国共产党的领导下，近年来，粮食总产量增加近两倍，牲畜增加了四十多万头，并且从无到有办起了一千九百多个中小型工厂。这样，就使全州根本改变了贫困落后面貌，藏族人民开始过着丰衣足食的幸福生活。
    解放前，这个地区农、牧业生产一直处在原始状态，许多地方还用牛角耕地，白笼下种，粮食亩产只有五、六十斤。工业方面更是一无所有，连一根铁钉也需要从外地运入。再加上民族内部不团结，经常互相械斗，使得不少人无以为生，靠乞讨度日。解放以后，这里的藏族人民在党的领导下，互助生产，兴修水利，逐步改变了落后的耕作方法。近两年来，他们掀起了群众性的工具改革和技术革新运动，改变了阻碍生产发展的陈规陋习和落后技术，连部分山高水急的地区也实现了车子化和索道化。去年，全州的灌溉面积达到十五万多亩，等于解放前千百年来修建的灌溉面积的两倍。全州有一万多亩坡地改成了梯田，有五万多亩田地改良了土壤。全州粮食总产量比1957年增产近50％，比解放前增产两倍，按农业人口计算，每人平均有粮一千斤。全州畜牧业也有很大发展，80％以上的牧民加入了牧业合作社，牧畜总头数比解放前增加四十多万头。
    工业方面，建立了以钢铁、机械为主的许多工业部门。现在，全州每个县都有主要生产农具的铁工厂和食品、酿造等各种加工厂。分布各地的化工厂生产出了大批化学肥料和农药。不但推动了当地生产，便利了藏族人民的生活，还为藏族农民增加了许多收益。
    自治州的文化教育事业也有很大发展。现在全州已建立十一所中等学校和五百五十九所小学，学校数量比1950年增加了近三倍，入学人数增加近二十倍。此外，全州还有一百九十多个医疗机构和许多电影院、电影放映队、文化馆以及农村俱乐部。
    新华社昆明17日电　云南省迪庆藏族自治州从实现区域自治以来，社会主义建设事业获得了迅速的发展，藏族人民在政治、经济和文化生活等方面都进入了一个新的历史时期。
    这个自治州处在云南省西北部高原上，全州聚居着近十万藏族人民。解放后，党和政府领导这里的藏族人民发展农业生产，到1957年，全区青稞和杂粮平均每亩产量增长了一倍，由一百多斤增长到二百五十多斤。1957年自治州成立以后，根据绝大多数人民的要求，并征得藏族上层人士同意，实行了民主改革。目前，自治州已经成立了五个人民公社，三十八个高级合作社和两个初级社，入社农户已占总农户97％以上。去年，全州粮食总产量由1957年的五千多万斤增加到七千多万斤，增产部分就等于解放初期全州粮食的总产量。
    在工作中，全州培养和锻炼了大批藏族干部。在中共迪庆藏族自治州工委委员中，就有藏族共产党员负责干部，各县、区、人民公社和合作社，也都有许多藏族干部担任主要领导职务。这些干部都能密切联系藏族群众，成为团结广大藏族群众发展生产、巩固合作化组织和正确贯彻党的民族政策、宗教政策的核心。
    过去这里的农业生产非常落后，贫苦农民普遍使用木棒耕田。解放后，人们从汉族地区请来了几个铁匠，建起两座铁匠炉制造农具，目前这两座炉子已经发展成为初具规模的机械厂了。今年，藏族农民不仅人人都用锄头和铁犁从事生产，而且有了多种轻便的新式步犁，最近草原上还出现了拖拉机。自治州现在不仅有机械厂、农具厂，还有了发电、毛纺、皮革等工厂，藏族工人已经达到了一千多人。
    随着工农业生产的迅速发展，藏族人民的生活也有了很大改善。过去贫苦农民往往半年吃不到一次酥油茶，现在绝大部分人都能天天吃到一定数量的酥油和盐、茶。过去大多数藏族人民从来没有穿过棉布，许多人连一身完整的麻布衣裳也穿不上；从去年起，棉布已经是这里的藏族人民普通的衣料，而且家家户户都有了毛毯、棉毯和毛毡。
    自治州的文教卫生事业也有了很大发展。
