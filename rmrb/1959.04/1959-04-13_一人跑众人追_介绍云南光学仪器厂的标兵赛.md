　　One Runs, Many Chase
　　——Introducing the Pace-Setter Competition at Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory
　　By our reporters Jin Yukun and Tian Lianggeng

    Starting Point
    When people measure whether an optical instrument is precise, they often look at the glass lens first, and the quality of the lens depends on "polishing."
    "Polishing" is a delicate task, and workers call this process "slow work yields fine results." Thus, it has become a difficult hurdle in the Great Leap Forward.
    Not long ago, Yang Zhongyin, a young polishing worker at the Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory, successfully created a "rapid polishing method" for processing certain precision optical glass parts. The polishing time was greatly shortened, and the product quality also met the requirements.
    This creation caused a chain reaction throughout the entire factory: the polishing process surged forward, and the subsequent coating process became a weak link. Originally, coating was not a backward process, but due to the advancement in polishing, it appeared to be lagging behind in comparison. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, no one was willing to fall behind. In order to catch up, coating workers painstakingly studied and improved the jig, and adopted a new method of coating the mouth surface at once, which increased efficiency by one to three times. This speed directly promoted the edging workers to also make a leap forward... As a result of such mutual promotion and mutual chasing, the monthly output value completed jumped from 300,000, 500,000, 800,000 to 1.2 million without increasing equipment and personnel, tripling in one fell swoop.

    Emergence of Heroes
    One breakthrough, everyone breaks through; one doubles, everyone doubles. This is the characteristic of the pace-setter competition at the Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory.
    The pace-setter competition is always inextricably linked to technological innovation. The emergence of advanced figures always involves one creation or another, either improving the process regulations or transforming manual operations into mechanical operations.
    Originally, the sixth workshop could not schedule its monthly plan because of a shortage of milling machines. The workshop shouted that at least twenty more milling machines were needed to cope. The factory specifically organized a technical research group to discuss countermeasures. An old worker on the milling machine named You Xianguang created an operating method of "parts clamping and fly cutter milling," which resulted in a two hundredfold increase in efficiency. You Xianguang was immediately listed as a pace-setter and became a model for the entire workshop to learn from. You Xianguang felt a great responsibility and took the initiative to go to other people's milling machines to take a look whenever he had time. Once, he discovered that the biological microscope parts processed by Zhang Shunyuan could use his method, so he taught Zhang Shunyuan by hand and manufactured a fixture for him overnight, which increased the efficiency of his parts processing by 150 times. Subsequently, 150 milling workers adopted his method on 127 processes and manufactured 96 sets of fixtures for them. Now, the labor productivity of this workshop has increased by 2.59 times.
    With the deepening development of the pace-setter competition, people's communist style is also gradually forming. In the fifth workshop, there is a girl named Fou Yuxian who improved the operation method and created a record of grinding 45 plates of optical instrument parts per day, thus becoming a pace-setter. In the beginning, this girl was a bit individualistic and always liked to be above others. A young man named Liu Jianfang, who had worked with her on the same machine, was her competitor. They set up a challenge ring between them. Although Fou Yuxian had also taught him her experience, she had always been nervous in her thoughts. Especially when Liu Jianfang created a record of grinding 65 plates per day, surpassing her, her heart skipped a beat, and she even shed tears. At this time, the Party and the trade union educated her. Later, she humbly learned from Liu Jianfang's experience and finally surpassed Liu Jianfang again. Liu Jianfang also learned from Fou Yuxian's experience and then caught up with her again. Whenever he surpassed her, Liu Jianfang always told her all his experience happily, humbly, and unreservedly, and said: "You must be prepared to surpass me, so that I can learn from you again!" This greatly moved her. This competition drove half of the entire work section to catch up with their level, and the efficiency of others also doubled.

    In-depth and Diverse
    After the pace-setter competition was launched, the work required discovering pace-setters, and leaders had to go deep down to conduct investigations and research, and at the same time, they also needed to improve the experience of pace-setters and systematize it. This prompted the leadership work to be more in-depth. Also, because who leads whom and who catches up with whom in the pace-setter competition are all published on the wall, the mass activities of various groups and work sections are very active, and on-site meetings, exhibitions, inspections, evaluations, and visits and performances are all controlled by the masses themselves.
    In addition, some workshops also have "pace-setter activity days." On activity days, pace-setters take the initiative to go to various machine tools to provide guidance and assistance. This has enriched the content of mass activities.
    The pace-setter competition has also promoted political and ideological work to become richer and more meticulous. Past competitions were generally carried out vigorously and with great momentum, which was good. But what was insufficient was that the ideological work was relatively rough. With the deepening development of the competition movement, to make a pace-setter consciously realize the relationship between the individual and the collective and take the initiative to help others, this requires leading cadres to squat down and do more and more meticulous ideological work.
    When a pace-setter has greater achievements, or is complacent and stagnant, or is proud and detached from the masses, the Party organization needs to conduct ideological education work frequently and continuously. In the past, the edging group in the fifth workshop had poor unity among the three shifts, and as a result, the task was often not completed. However, after the Party organization and the trade union conducted in-depth ideological education, the work of this group underwent a fundamental change. Now, the three groups support each other, and the monthly output has jumped from more than 30,000 pieces to 70,000 to 80,000 pieces, becoming an excellent group in production.
    Through the pace-setter competition, the labor productivity of this factory has increased by one and a half times, and 290,000 technological innovations have been achieved. The task for the first quarter of this year increased by 25% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and the result was that the state plan was completed evenly on a ten-day basis.

　　一人跑众人追
　　——介绍云南光学仪器厂的标兵赛

    起点
    人们在衡量一种光学仪器是否精密的时候，往往是先看玻璃镜头，而镜头的好坏，又决定于“抛光”。
    “抛光”是一件细致活儿，工人们把这一道工序叫做“慢工出细活”。这样，它就成了大跃进的一道难关了。
    不久以前，云南光学仪器厂的青年抛光工人杨钟璌，对加工某些精密光学玻璃零件，成功地创造了“快速抛光法”，抛光时间大大缩短，产品质量也符合要求。
    这个创造引起了整个工厂一阵连锁反应：抛光工序突上去了，下道镀膜工序就成了薄弱环节。本来，镀膜并不是落后工序，但是，由于抛光的突进，相形之下，它就落后了。在大跃进的时代，谁也不甘落后；为了赶上去，镀膜工人苦心钻研，改进了夹具，采取了一次镀口面的新方法，一下效率就提高了一至三倍。这样的速度直接促进了磨边工人不能不也来个跃进……这样互相促进、互相追赶的结果，在不增加设备和人员的情况下，每月完成的产值由三十万、五十万、八十万跃进到一百二十万，一下就翻了三番。
    英雄辈出
    一人突破，大家突破；一个翻番，全体翻番。这是云南光学仪器厂标兵赛的特点。
    标兵赛始终是和技术革新血肉相联的。先进人物的出现，总是有这样或那样的创造，或是改进了工艺规程，或是变手工操作为机械操作。
    原先，六车间每月排计划都无法排下去，原因就在于铣床不足，车间叫喊至少要添二十部铣床才能应付，厂里为此专门组织了技术研究组，商讨对策。铣床上有个老工人叫游现光，创造了“零件装夹和飞刀铣切”的操作方法，结果效率提高了两百倍。游现光马上就被列为标兵，成为全车间学习的榜样。游现光感到责任重大，一有空，就主动地跑到人家铣床上去看看。一次，他发现张顺元加工的生物显微镜零件可以采用他的方法，于是，就把着手教会了张顺元，并且连夜给他制造了夹具，使他加工的零件效率提高了一百五十倍。接着，有一百五十个铣工在一百二十七道工序上都采用了他的方法，并为他们制造了九十六副夹具。现在，这个车间劳动生产率提高了二点五九倍。
    随着标兵赛的深入发展，人们的共产主义风格也在逐渐形成。在五车间，有个叫缶玉仙的姑娘，她改进了操作方法，创造了日磨光学仪器部件四十五盘的纪录，因此成了标兵。开始，这位姑娘还有些个人主义，总喜欢高人一头。和她曾在一台机床上工作过的小伙子刘建芳，是她的竞赛对手，他们之间摆开了擂台。缶玉仙虽然也曾把自己的经验教给他，但思想上一直很紧张。特别当刘建芳创造日磨六十五盘超过了她的时候，她心发跳，甚至淌下了眼泪。这时，党和工会就对她进行了教育。后来，她虚心地学习了刘建芳的经验，终于又超过了刘建芳，刘建芳又学了缶玉仙的经验，再赶过了她。每当他超过她的时候，刘建芳总是愉快虚心和毫无保留地把全部经验告诉她，并说：“你一定要准备赶过我，好让我再向你学习！”这使她大受感动。这场竞赛带动了整个工段也有一半人赶上了他们的水平，其他的人效率也都提高了一倍。
    深入和多样
    标兵赛搞起来以后，工作上需要发现标兵，领导人员就必须深入下去作调查研究，同时还需要把标兵的经验，加以提高使之系统化。这就促使领导工作更加深入。也由于在标兵赛当中，谁带谁，谁赶谁都公布在墙上，因此各个小组、工段群众性的活动搞得非常活跃，现场会，展览会，检查评比，参观表演也都由群众自己掌握。
    此外有的车间还设有“标兵活动日”，在活动日，标兵就主动到各个机床去进行指导和帮助。这就促使群众性的活动内容更加丰富。
    标兵赛也促使了政治思想工作越做越丰富，越做越细致。过去的竞赛一般都搞得轰轰烈烈，声势浩大，这是好的。但是不够的是思想工作做得比较粗糙。随着竞赛运动的深入发展，要使一个标兵能自觉地认识到个人与集体的关系，并主动地帮助别人，这就需要领导干部蹲下来做更多更细致的思想工作。
    当一个标兵有较大的成就，或自满而停滞，或骄傲而脱离群众的时候，这就需要党组织经常不断地进行思想教育工作。五车间的磨边小组，过去三班工人团结不好，结果任务经常完不成。但在党组织与工会进行深入的思想教育后，这个小组的工作有了根本的改变。现在，三个组互相支援，月产量由三万多件跃进到七、八万件，成为生产上很出色的小组。
    通过标兵赛，这个厂的劳动生产率提高了一倍半，技术革新实现了二十九万件。今年一季度任务较去年四季度增长25％，结果是按旬均匀地完成了国家计划。
