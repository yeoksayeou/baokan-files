Comparing the talks given by Indian Prime Minister Nehru after meeting the Dalai Lama and the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian officials in Tezpur, one can gain considerable insight.

The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" distributed in Tezpur reads: "On March 17th, mortar shells were fired at the Norbulingka Palace, two or three shells. Fortunately, the shells all landed in a nearby pond. After this, the advisors recognized the danger to the Dalai Lama's person, and under those difficult circumstances, it became very urgent for the Dalai Lama, his family members, and his senior officials to leave Lhasa."

Mr. Nehru said in his talks in Mussoorie: "When, according to the statement (note: referring to the so-called Dalai Lama's statement of April 18th), those 'shells or something fell on his palace' -- whatever the reason -- this had a strong impact on their thinking. Since everything was over, 'let's go,' so they left within six hours."

Here we have: one statement, two versions; or one event, two accounts.

How do we know? Dear reader, be patient and listen to my detailed explanation.

Firstly, what exactly was fired at the Norbulingka (the Dalai Lama's palace)? The Tezpur statement said that mortar shells were fired. Nehru first said "shells," but having just uttered these two words, Mr. Nehru himself became doubtful, and immediately added "or something" after "shells." One is "shells," very specific, which can kill people; the other is "something," which is too abstract and cannot kill people. What exactly is "something"? Did some naughty children throw a few stones? Or was it a feather that fell from a bird in the sky? What exactly was it? Only God knows!

Secondly, where did this one or several "something" fall? The Tezpur statement said that "they all fell into a nearby pond," while the Mussoorie talks, six days later, "according to the statement" said they "fell on his palace." Here is another mystery. Here we encounter an all-powerful magician, with the wave of his magic wand, a "something" rolls from the palace into the pond, or jumps from the pond back onto the palace. One "statement," two versions, can go up or down, freely used. Truly amazing ability! But where exactly did it fall? Still, only God knows!

Thirdly, why did "something" fall somewhere? The Tezpur statement said that mortars were fired. Who fired them? Unknown! The Mussoorie talks were even more straightforward: "Whatever the reason." Heavens! What the "something" was is unknown, where it fell is unclear, and the reason is disregarded. However, this constitutes the "danger to the Dalai Lama's person" mentioned in the Tezpur statement, or the "strong impact" mentioned in the Mussoorie talks. And so, the Dalai Lama left Lhasa in a "situation" where two or three things are not understood. What a strange logic!

Dear reader, based on this logic, the strange article goes as follows: "Until 4:00 PM on March 17th, the Dalai Lama had no intention of leaving Lhasa. At this time, for some unknown reason, from some unknown place, flew one (or two or three) unknown things, which landed in an unknown place, thus having a strong impact on their thinking. Since everything was over, let's go!"

Dear reader, can you guess what this strange article is about?

    奇文共赏
    把印度总理尼赫鲁会见达赖喇嘛以后的谈话和在提斯浦尔由印度官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”加以对照，人们可以获得不少见识。
    在提斯浦尔散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”里写道：“3月17日，迫击炮朝着罗布林卡宫打了两三炮。幸而炮弹都落到附近的一个池塘里去了。在此以后，顾问们认识到对于达赖喇嘛人身的危险，在那种困难的情况下，对达赖喇嘛、他的家庭成员以及他的高级官员来说，离开拉萨就成为十分紧迫的了。”
    尼赫鲁先生在穆索里的谈话里说：“当据声明（按：指4月18日的所谓达赖喇嘛的声明）说，那些‘炮弹或者什么东西落在他的宫殿上’——不管是什么原因——的时候，这就对他们的想法产生了强烈的影响。既然一切都完了，‘我们走吧’，于是他们就在六小时以内离开了。”
    这里就出现了：一个声明，两个版本；或者一件事情，两种说法。
    何以见得？看官且慢，听我细道端详。
    其一，究竟朝着罗布林卡（达赖喇嘛的宫殿）打了什么东西？提斯浦尔的声明说是迫击炮打了炮弹。尼赫鲁先说是
  “炮弹”，但是，刚刚说了两个字，尼赫鲁先生自己就怀疑起来了，紧接着“炮弹”之后加了“或者什么东西”。一个是“炮弹”，很具体，那会打死人的；一个是“东西”，这就太抽象了，打不死人的。到底是“什么东西”呢？是谁家顽皮的孩子扔了几块石头吗？还是天上的飞鸟掉下来的一根羽毛呢？到底是什么？只有上帝知道！
    其二，这样一个或者几个“什么东西”，落到哪儿去了呢？提斯浦尔声明的说法是“都落到附近的一个池塘里去了”，而在六天以后，穆索里的谈话中“据声明”说是“落在他的宫殿上”。这又是一个谜了。这里我们遇到了一个万能的魔法师，随着他的魔杖的挥动，一个“什么东西”从宫殿上滚下池塘，或者从池塘里又跳上宫殿。一个“声明”，两种说法，可上可下，运用自如。真是了不起的本领！可是到底落在什么地方了呢？还是只有上帝知道！
    其三，究竟为什么会有“什么东西”落到什么地方呢？提斯浦尔的声明说，打了迫击炮。什么人打的？不知道！穆索里的谈话说的更干脆：“不管什么原因”。天呵！什么东西不知道，落到什么地方也说不清，什么原因也不管。可是，这就构成了提斯浦尔声明所说的“对达赖喇嘛人身的危险”，或者穆索里谈话所说的“产生了强烈的影响”。而且，达赖喇嘛就这样在两个或三个什么也不明白的“形势”下离开拉萨了。这是多么奇异的逻辑呵！
    看官，根据这样的逻辑，奇文如下：“到3月17日下午四点为止，达赖喇嘛并没有离开拉萨的想法，这时候，不知什么原因，从不知什么地方，飞来了一个（或者两三个）不知是什么的东西，不知落到了什么地方，于是，对他们的想法产生了强烈的影响。既然一切都完了，我们走吧！”
    亲爱的看官，你能猜透这篇奇文说的是什么吗？
