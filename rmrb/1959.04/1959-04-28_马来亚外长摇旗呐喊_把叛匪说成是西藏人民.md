    Malayan Foreign Minister Waves the Flag and Shouts
    Calling the Rebels the People of Tibet
    Xinhua News Agency, April 25th, Kuala Lumpur Dispatch: The Foreign Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Ismail, made a statement to the press on the 20th, using the Tibetan rebellion to conduct anti-communist clamoring. He said something along the lines of "The CCP's attitude towards Tibet has strengthened our belief that there can be no compromise with the communists."
    Ismail, turning black and white upside down, referred to the small number of Tibetan rebels as "the oppressed Tibetan people." He attempted to stir up an atmosphere of using the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs, saying: If this matter is submitted to the United Nations for discussion, the Federation of Malaya will fully support the Tibetan rebels.

    新华社25日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚联合邦外交部长伊斯梅尔20日对报界发表谈话，利用西藏叛乱事件进行反共叫嚣。他说什么“中共对西藏的态度已经加强了我们对共产党不能妥协的信念”。
    伊斯梅尔颠倒黑白地把西藏少数叛匪称作“被压迫的西藏人民”。他企图煽动利用联合国来干涉中国内政的空气，说什么：如果这件事被提交联合国讨论，马来亚联合邦将全力支持西藏叛乱分子。
