Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The 41 NPC deputies and CPPCC members, representing 16 ethnic groups, today warned Indian expansionists that their plot to exploit the Tibetan rebellion to realize their expansionist ambitions will never succeed.

In the afternoon session today of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, the representatives continued to severely condemn the behavior of imperialists and foreign reactionaries in supporting the Tibetan armed rebellion and interfering in China's internal affairs.

Thirty-eight representatives and CPPCC members from fifteen ethnic minorities, including Tibetan, Uyghur, Dai, Yi, Lisu, Naxi, Yao, Hani, Lahu, Bai, Zhuang, Kawa, Hui, Jingpo, and Miao, solemnly declared in their speeches: The unification of the socialist motherland and the unity of all nationalities are the supreme interests of all peoples. Any imperialist and reactionary attempts to undermine the unity of our great motherland will be resolutely countered by the people of all nationalities in our country.

The imperialists and Indian expansionists staged an ugly farce of mourning for their parents, but their crocodile tears cannot deceive anyone.

Saifudin, NPC representative and Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, pointed out in his speech to the Congress that no imperialism is allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs, and no foreigners are allowed to interfere in any affairs, big or small, within China. He warned those who want to interfere in our internal affairs that any conspiracy against China is in vain, and the result is just a bubble. In his speech, Saifudin cited a large number of examples of the vigorous development of various construction undertakings in Xinjiang after liberation, fully illustrating that only under the leadership of the Party and united in the big family of the motherland can the minority nationalities in our country get rid of poverty and backwardness and achieve rapid development in politics, economy, and culture. He said that the imperialists' plot to undermine China's unity and national unity has failed in the past, and it is even more impossible for them to achieve their goals today when the people of all nationalities in China are more closely united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Imperialists and foreign reactionaries cannot benefit from the Tibetan issue.

The speech of Xi Rao Jia Cuo, NPC representative and President of the Buddhist Association of China, repeatedly aroused warm applause from the audience. Master Xi Rao Jia Cuo, who has lived in Tibet for more than 30 years, powerfully refuted the slanders of the imperialists and foreign reactionaries against the Chinese Communist Party on religious issues and exposed their plot to split China with a solemn stance and irrefutable facts.

Xi Rao Jia Cuo pointed out that the imperialists and Indian expansionists are taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble and pretending to cry for the destruction of Tibetan Buddhism. We know that in order to deceive the religious community, imperialists sometimes pretend to be tearful, but crocodile tears can never deceive Chinese Buddhists from doubting the Chinese Communist Party, which correctly implements the policy of freedom of religious belief and takes protective measures for religion. He said that our Tibetan people have a strong Buddhist faith and even sharper discerning eyes. Those who collude with imperialists, betray the motherland, kill and set fires, and tarnish the sanctity of Buddhism are regarded as deserving death and will never be tolerated. This is not only punishing rebellious officials and traitors for the country and the people, but also eliminating scum and rectifying rules for Buddhism, which is a merit of protecting the Dharma.

Xi Rao Jia Cuo pointed out that some expansionists in India have "forgotten the pain after the wound has healed." They have forgotten the disasters of the dark age when British imperialism occupied India and instead inherited its aggressive mantle, wanting to replace British imperialism's past privileges in Tibet. If expansionists do not change their course, not only will their fantasies never be realized, but they will also incur the disaster of inviting wolves into the house.

Master Xi Rao Jia Cuo pointed out that the imperialists who are trying to invade China are shamelessly making a big fuss about the Tibetan issue, behind which is hidden an even more vicious conspiracy to create tension in Asia, undermine China's friendly relations with Asian countries, and force Asian countries to abandon their neutral policies and return to their enslavement.

Chen Shutong, NPC representative and Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said in his speech that the Indian expansionists' support for Tibetan traitors has seriously threatened the friendly relations between China and India and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which is intolerable to the Chinese people.

Indian expansionists are truly "blinded by a leaf, unable to recognize Mount Tai." Their attempt to fish in troubled waters will always be a beautiful soap bubble.

Chen Shutong solemnly warned the Indian people that they must recognize that the Tibetan upper-class reactionaries who have fled to India are only a small handful of Tibetan scum; the vast majority of the Tibetan people, 99%, resolutely support the unification of the motherland and resolutely oppose the criminal acts of the traitors. They are irreconcilable with the traitors. Chen Shutong pointed out that the Chinese people who are heroically building socialism will never allow foreign forces to harm our independence and unity, and will never allow them to interfere in or manipulate our internal affairs; all honest Indian people will not tolerate the collusion between Tibetan traitors and Indian expansionists to carry out criminal activities against China in India for a long time.

Cheng Qian, NPC representative and Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, severely condemned the imperialists and Indian expansionists for playing the role of behind-the-scenes directors in the Tibetan armed rebellion. They have exhausted their ability to instigate, manipulate, incite, and provoke. Cheng Qian pointed out that these people are opening their greedy wolf mouths, vainly trying to get some "cheap" on the Tibetan issue, but the result can only be contrary to their wishes, exposing their ugly faces more deeply in front of the people of the world, and making themselves even more isolated.

Cheng Qian sharply ridiculed the Indian expansionists as truly "blinded by a leaf, unable to recognize Mount Tai." They cannot see the changes in the overall world situation, cannot see the great changes in the People's Republic of China, and vainly try to inherit the legacy of British imperialism and attempt to fish in troubled waters on the Tibetan issue.

Cheng Qian solemnly warned the Indian expansionists who do not consider the times or their own capabilities: Evil intentions will never succeed, and the attempt to fish in troubled waters will always be a beautiful soap bubble. If they continue to fantasize about making a fuss about the Tibetan issue, they will soon find themselves in a dilemma and a very embarrassing situation.

Let the foreign invaders and rebels shout and cry! A backward, dark, and cruel Tibet is about to become a thing of the past, and a new democratic and socialist Tibet will soon appear.

Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), NPC representative, Vice Governor of Gansu Province, and Governor of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, severely condemned the Tibetan rebels' shameless clamor to "drive out the Han people" and other attempts to provoke relations between the Han and Tibetan nationalities. He said that since liberation, under the brilliant light of the great national policy, the friendly and cooperative relations between the Han and Tibetan nationalities have achieved unprecedented development. Without the kind help of the Han nationality, it would be impossible to imagine that our Tibetan nationality could become an advanced nationality.

Huang Zhengqing said that the unification of the motherland is the common supreme interest of all nationalities. The former Tibetan local government and the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group pretended to represent the interests of the Tibetan nationality in order to cover up their crime of betraying the country, but this is of no avail. Their criminal activities have been resolutely opposed by the people of all nationalities in the country, especially the Tibetan people, and have fallen into shameful failure.

Huang Zhengqing said, let the foreign invaders and rebels shout and cry! A backward, dark, and cruel Tibet is about to become a thing of the past; a new democratic and socialist Tibet will soon appear on the land of the motherland.

Fu Zuoyi, NPC representative and Minister of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, expressed great indignation at the behavior of imperialists and Indian expansionists in supporting the Tibetan rebellion. He pointed out that imperialists and foreign reactionaries are always unwilling to accept our victory, and they always try to create division within us. However, these conspiracies are doomed to failure.

Fu Zuoyi emphasized that the liberated Tibetan people will surely be able to quickly and thoroughly smash the conspiracies and tricks of a small handful of rebels and imperialists, remove the stumbling blocks on the road ahead, and, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, smoothly realize democratic reform and build the Tibetan Plateau into a true paradise on earth.

Zhao Cunxin, NPC representative and Governor of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, spoke on behalf of 22 representatives of various ethnic minorities in Yunnan, including Dao Jingban, and 13 CPPCC members. Zhao Cunxin pointed out that the imperialists and foreign reactionaries' plot to split our great motherland has been completely shattered like a bubble. After these reactionary guys failed, they could not hide their inner anger and sadness, desperately created rumors, distorted black and white, issued various vicious curses and helpless moans, and even racked their brains to create a so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," trying to confuse people and achieve ulterior motives. But all this is in vain.

Zhao Cunxin emphasized that we must safeguard the unity of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities as we protect our own eyeballs, and resolutely fight against any behavior that splits the motherland and undermines national unity, and resolutely oppose any attempt by foreign reactionary forces to relive the old dream of imperialism and interfere in China's internal affairs.

All the representatives' speeches at the afternoon session today were warmly welcomed.

The representatives' speeches at the conference also talked about the great achievements in various aspects of our country's socialist construction, and expressed their determination to achieve a continued great leap forward in 1959. In their speeches, they unanimously supported Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

All members of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC attended the meeting as observers.

Foreign envoys to China and some foreign guests in Beijing were invited to attend the meeting as observers.

The executive chairmen of the afternoon session today were: Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Xu Xiangqian, Saifudin, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhipu, Shi Liang, Wei Guoqing, Zhu Dehai, Wu Yaozong, Guo Dihuo, and Wang Shaoyu.

The afternoon session today ended at 6:20 p.m. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

    全国人民代表大会的各族代表对干涉者的挑衅行为表示极大愤慨
    严正警告印度扩张主义分子
    企图利用西藏叛乱事件实现扩张野心的可耻阴谋永远不能得逞
    任何帝国主义和反动分子破坏我国统一的行为将遭到坚决回击
    新华社23日讯　包括十六个民族的四十一位人大代表和政协委员，今天警告印度扩张主义者，他们企图利用西藏叛乱事件实现扩张野心的阴谋是永远不能得逞的。
    在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议今天下午的大会讨论中，代表们继续严厉谴责帝国主义与外国反动派支持西藏武装叛乱和干涉中国内政的行为。
    藏、维吾尔、傣、彝、傈僳、纳西、瑶、哈尼、拉祜、白、僮、佧佤、回、景颇、苗等十五个少数民族的三十八位代表和政协委员在发言中庄严宣称：社会主义祖国的统一和民族团结是各族人民的最高利益。任何帝国主义和反动分子企图破坏我们伟大祖国的统一，我国各族人民一定坚决予以回击。
    帝国主义者和印度扩张主义者表演了一出如丧考妣的丑戏，但是，他们的假眼泪无论如何也骗不了人
    全国人民代表大会代表、新疆维吾尔自治区主席赛福鼎在大会上的发言中指出，中国内政决不允许任何帝国主义干涉，中国内部的一切大小事务决不允许任何外国人插手。他警告那些想干涉我国内部事务的人，他们对中国的任何阴谋诡计都是枉费心机的，其结果只不过是一个泡影而已。赛福鼎在发言中列举了解放后新疆各项建设事业蓬勃发展的大量事例，充分说明我国少数民族，只有在党的领导下，团结在祖国大家庭中，才能摆脱贫困落后的境地，取得政治经济文化的迅速发展。他说，帝国主义破坏我国统一和民族团结的阴谋，过去都遭到了失败，在中国共产党领导下中国各族人民更加紧密团结起来的今天，它们更是根本不可能达到目的。帝国主义和外国反动派是不可能在西藏问题上得到好处的。
    全国人民代表大会代表、中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错在会上的发言一再引起全场热烈的掌声。喜饶嘉错大师在西藏居住过三十多年，他今天以严正的立场和不可辩驳的事实，有力地驳斥了帝国主义和外国反动派在宗教问题上对中国共产党的诽谤，戳穿了他们企图分裂中国的阴谋。
    喜饶嘉错指出，帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子借西藏的叛乱兴风作浪，装腔做势的表演一出为西藏佛教遭破坏而痛哭流涕，如丧考妣的丑戏，我们熟知帝国主义者为了骗取宗教界的轻信，有时装得声泪俱下，但是，假眼泪无论如何也骗取不了中国佛教徒会怀疑正确执行信仰自由政策而对宗教采取保护措施的中国共产党。他说，我们藏族人民有强烈的佛教信仰，更有锋利的慧眼，对那些勾结帝国主义，背叛祖国，杀人放火，玷污佛教圣洁的假佛教徒，认为死有余罪，决不姑息。这不仅是为国家人民诛了乱臣贼子，也是为佛门除败类正清规的护法功德。
    喜饶嘉错指出，印度的一些扩张主义者“好了疮疤忘了痛”，他们居然忘怀英帝国主义霸占印度的黑暗时代的灾难，反而继承其侵略衣钵，欲取英帝国主义过去在西藏的特权而代之。扩张主义者如不改弦更张，不仅他们的空想永远达不到，反而将招致引狼入室的后患。
    喜饶嘉错大师指出，力图侵略中国的帝国主义厚颜无耻地在西藏问题上大做文章，其背后，实隐藏着借此制造亚洲紧张局势，破坏我国与亚洲国家的友好关系，以遂其迫使亚洲国家放弃中立政策，重新供其奴役的更恶毒的大阴谋。
    全国人民代表大会代表、全国工商联主任委员陈叔通在发言中说，印度扩张主义分子支持西藏叛国分子，使中印两国友好关系和和平共处五项原则遭到严重威胁，这是中国人民不能容忍的。
    印度扩张主义分子真是“一叶障眼，不识泰山”，混水摸鱼的企图永远是一个美丽的肥皂泡
    陈叔通正告印度人士必须认清，逃亡在印度的西藏上层反动分子只是一小撮藏族的败类；西藏99％的广大藏族人民坚决拥护祖国统一、坚决反对叛国分子的罪恶行为，他们是同叛国分子势不两立的。陈叔通指出，正在英勇地建设社会主义的中国人民绝不容许外国势力损害我们的独立和统一，绝不容许他们干涉、摆布我国内政；所有正直的印度人民，也不会长期容忍西藏叛国分子和印度扩张主义者勾结起来在印度进行反对中国的罪恶活动。
    全国人民代表大会代表、中国国民党革命委员会副主席程潜，在发言中严厉谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子在西藏武装叛乱的问题上完全扮演了幕后主持人的角色，他们极尽怂恿、摆布、嗾使、挑拨之能事。程潜指出，这些人张开贪婪的狼嘴，妄想在西藏问题上讨点“便宜”，结果只能是事与愿违，适得其反，在世界人民面前更深刻地暴露自己的丑恶面貌，使自己更加孤立。
    程潜尖锐地讥讽印度扩张主义分子真是“一叶障眼，不识泰山”。他们看不见整个世界形势的变化，看不见中华人民共和国的伟大变化，妄想继承英帝国主义的遗策，企图在西藏问题上混水摸鱼。
    程潜严正地警告不审时、不量力的印度扩张主义分子：不良的居心永远不能得逞，搅混水摸鱼的企图永远是一个美丽的肥皂泡。如果他们痴心妄想继续在西藏问题上做甚么文章，他们就会很快地发现自己已陷入一种进退维谷、十分狼狈的境地。
    让外国侵略者和叛乱分子去叫嚣和哭泣吧！一个落后、黑暗、残酷的西藏就要成为过去，一个民主和社会主义的新西藏很快就会出现
    全国人民代表大会代表、甘肃省副省长、甘南藏族自治州州长黄正清（藏族），在发言中严厉斥责了西藏叛乱分子所谓“赶走汉人”等等挑拨汉藏民族关系的无耻叫嚣。他说，解放以来，在伟大的民族政策的光辉照耀下，汉藏民族的友爱合作关系获得了空前的发展。如果没有汉族的亲切帮助，我们藏族要成为一个先进的民族，是不可能想像的。
    黄正清说，祖国的统一，是各民族共同的最高利益。原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团，为了掩盖自己的叛国罪行，装出一副代表西藏民族利益的样子，这是无济于事的。他们的罪恶活动遭到了全国各族人民首先是西藏人民的坚决反对，而陷于可耻的失败。
    黄正清说，让外国侵略者和叛乱分子去叫嚣和哭泣吧！落后、黑暗、残酷的西藏就要成为过去；一个民主和社会主义的新西藏很快就会出现在祖国的大地上。
    全国人民代表大会代表、水利电力部长傅作义，在发言中对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子支持西藏叛乱的行为表示极大愤慨。他指出，帝国主义和外国反动派对我们的胜利总是不甘心的，他们总是企图在我们内部制造分裂。但是，这些阴谋是注定要失败的。
    傅作义强调说，解放了的西藏人民，一定能够迅速地彻底粉碎一小撮叛乱分子和帝国主义的阴谋诡计，搬掉前进道路上的绊脚石，在中央人民政府和西藏自治区筹备委员会的领导下，顺利地实现民主改革，把西藏高原建设成一个真正的人间乐园。
    全国人民代表大会代表、云南省西双版纳傣族自治州州长召存信代表云南各少数民族代表刀京版等二十二人和政协委员十三人，在会上作了发言。召存信指出，帝国主义和外国反动派企图分裂我们伟大祖国的阴谋，像泡沫一样彻底破灭了。这些反动家伙在失败以后，掩盖不住内心的恼怒和悲伤，拼命制造谣言，颠倒黑白，发出各种恶毒的咒骂和无可奈何的哀鸣，甚至挖空心思，制造出一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，企图这样淆惑听闻，达到不可告人的目的。但这一切都是枉费心机罢了。
    召存信强调说，我们必须像维护自己的眼珠一样来维护祖国的统一和各民族的团结，同任何分裂祖国破坏民族团结的行为进行坚决的斗争，坚决反对任何外国反动势力重温帝国主义旧梦、干涉中国内政的企图。
    所有代表在今天下午大会上的发言，都受到了热烈欢迎。
    代表们在大会上的发言，还谈到了我国社会主义建设事业各方面的巨大成就，表示了实现1959年继续大跃进的决心。他们在发言中一致拥护周总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的各项报告。
    政协第三届全国委员会全体委员列席参加了会议。
    外国驻华使节和部分在京外宾应邀列席会议。
    今天下午大会的执行主席是：李济深、罗荣桓、徐向前、赛福鼎、张治中、吴芝圃、史良、韦国清、朱德海、吴耀宗、郭棣活、王绍鏊。
    今天下午的大会在六时二十分结束。明天，会议将继续举行。
