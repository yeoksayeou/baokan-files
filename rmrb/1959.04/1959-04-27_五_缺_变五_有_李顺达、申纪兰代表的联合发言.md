From Five “Lacks” to Five “Haves”
Joint Speech by Representatives Li Shunda and Shen Jilan

“Metal” – Large iron ore deposits have been discovered and are being heavily mined; “Wood” – Barren hills and ridges in Guangshan are gradually becoming wooded slopes and orchards; “Water” – Communes are jointly harnessing the river beaches, and mountain gullies are being transformed into regions like southern China; “Fire” – Coal has been found, electricity is being generated, and electric lights illuminate the Taihang Mountains; “Earth” – All land has been terraced, and soil erosion is basically under control.

Chairman, Fellow Representatives:

Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government has made crystal clear the situation of our country as time passes. We fully endorse it. Our socialist family of 650 million people is like the morning sun, the full moon on the fifteenth, prosperous in both people and wealth, a scene of flourishing vitality. Speaking of this, I can't help but talk about my hometown and say a few words from my heart.

Fellow Representatives, I come from the spine of the Taihang Mountains. In previous National People's Congresses, I said that our place was originally a place where the “five elements – metal, wood, water, fire, and earth – were all lacking.” You can tell it was a poor mountain village just by hearing that. But if you ask what it's like now? My answer is very simple, just one word: in the nine characters, change the word “lack” to the word “have.” It's called “the five elements – metal, wood, water, fire, and earth – are all present.”

Fellow Representatives, for everyone to understand the situation, I must say a few more words.

Let's talk about "metal" first! Now we have discovered a large iron ore deposit there, with preliminary calculations after exploration showing about seven million tons. It is now being heavily mined. Roads have been built, and railways have also been constructed. Carload after carload of ore is being transported to the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant. Look, it's not that Pingshun lacks "metal," it's just that we didn't know we had treasure. Of course, I have to say again, why are we able to know now and dig it out? Isn't it all thanks to having a new socialist society? This large iron ore deposit has brought a new atmosphere to the lives of the people of Pingshun. Everyone likes it and everyone celebrates.

Let's talk about “wood” again! Before, it wasn't others who were wrong in saying it, the mountains were all barren. We ourselves felt it was unsightly. What about now? They have grown hair. Take our commune as an example, we already have 30,000 mu of wooded slopes, 50,000 fruit trees, and 1 million walnut trees, achieving the plan of ten thousand mu of forest and one thousand mu of orchard.

Looking at “water,” before, not to mention irrigating the land, even the drinking water for people was often cut off. Outsiders knew that in Pingshun “water is as precious as oil.” Although there was no benefit from water, there were many harms. Whenever there was a heavy rain, mountain floods would often wash away crops and houses. What about now? Last year, we put forward a slogan called "Fight the Hundred-Li Beach, Transform Pingshun into Southern China." Our commune and neighboring communes united and fought bitterly for a hundred days on the hundred-li long river beach, building more than a hundred large and small reservoirs, more than 5,200 gully dams (water storage ponds), 51 flood control dams, and 5,600 large and small canals, and also dug more than 1,900 drought wells. Although it has not truly become southern China, we have water.

Let's look at "fire" again. In the past, saying that Pingshun lacked "fire" mainly referred to the lack of fuel. We have found coal mines and are mining them. If we have coal, can't we light a fire? Not only do we have "fire," but there is also electricity on the top of the Taihang Mountains. Electric lights shine brightly in some communes, and some even use electricity to work.

Finally, let's talk about “earth.” The mountains are large and the plains are small, with thick rocks and thin soil. That's how it was originally. People cultivated the land by carrying soil to create land and building terraces. But there were few trees and grass on the mountains. Whenever there was heavy rain, the water would carry the soil away! Therefore, people often said: “Barren mountains and ridges have no wooded slopes, dry and rocky river beaches have no prospects, droughts, floods, wind, and hail occur every year, and crops fail in nine out of ten years.” Now the situation has changed greatly. All cultivated land has been terraced, framed with embankments, with hills closed off for afforestation and raising forests, fish-scale pits dug, and reservoirs built, basically controlling soil erosion. With water and soil, it is easier to grow crops, and yields can increase step by step. Before liberation, the yield per mu was 180 jin; in the mutual aid group period in 1951, each mu yielded 242 jin; in the agricultural cooperative period in 1957, the yield increased to 461 jin; in 1958, there was a great leap forward, and the yield per mu suddenly increased to 803 jin. This number was something we wouldn't have dared to imagine before.

Fellow Representatives, I said that the "five lacks" have become "five haves," and indeed they "have." But this "have" is preliminary, just laying a foundation. We will never be complacent or slacken our efforts. We will make an even greater leap forward in 1959, and make great leap forwards every year, turning small haves into big haves, until we have communism.

Fellow Representatives, when the "five lacks" turned into "five haves," we wondered how this transformation came about? Some say it was brought about by people's labor, which is true. But in the past, it was also this place, also these people, also laboring, why couldn't it "transform"? Tracing it to the end, I understand that it was because we had a good socialist society. Who led the establishment of this good society? Our Party, our leader Chairman Mao. We farmers are very clear about this series of reasons. Therefore, everyone loves socialism so much, loves the people's communes so much, and supports the Party and Chairman Mao so much. I heard that there is a Dulles in the world, and some other miscellaneous people, who are scolding us and saying bad things about us. Let them scold with their tongues in their mouths. How can tongues block our path forward? That's all!

### 五“缺”变五“有”  李顺达、申纪兰代表的联合发言

    五“缺”变五“有”
    李顺达、申纪兰代表的联合发言
    “金”——探出了大铁矿，正在大开采；“木”——光山秃岭渐成林坡果园；“水”——公社联合治河滩，山沟正在变江南；“火”——找到煤，发出电，电灯照亮了太行山；“土”——全部土地地埂化，基本控制水土流失。主席、各位代表：
    周总理作的政府工作报告，把我们国家过时光的情形说了个一清二楚。我们完全拥护。我们这个六亿五千万人口的社会主义大家庭，就像早晨的太阳，十五的月亮，人和财旺，一片兴盛气象。说到这里，不由得我要说说我们那个地方，说几句心里话。
    各位代表，我是从太行山的脊梁上来的。在前几次的人民代表大会上，我说过，我们那里原是“金木水火土五行俱缺”的地方，一听就知道是个穷山沟。可是你们要问现在怎样了？我的回答很简单，只有一个字，在九个字里把“缺”字改成“有”字就行了。叫做“金木水火土五行俱有”。
    各位代表，为了大家明白个究竟，还得多说几句。
    先说“金”吧！现在我们那里探出了一个大铁矿，经过勘探初步计算有七百万吨左右，现在正在大开采，公路通了，铁路也修去了，一车车的矿石拉到了长治钢铁厂。看，不是平顺缺“金属”，原是有宝不知道。当然话又得说回来，为什么现在能知道，又能挖出来？这还不是全靠有了社会主义的新社会吗？这个大铁矿可给平顺人民生活带来了新气象，人人喜欢，个个庆贺。
    再说“木”！先前，可也不是别人枉说，一座一座的山，都是光秃秃的。自己也觉得难看。现在呢？长起头发来了。就以我们公社说，已有了三万亩林坡，五万株水果树，一百万棵核桃树，实现了万亩林千亩园的计划。
    再看“水”，先前，不用说浇地了，人吃的也是经常绝口，外地人都知道平顺“水贵如油”。别看水“利”没有，可是水“害”却不少，一遇大雨，山洪下来，往往把庄稼和房子就冲跑啦。现在呢？去年我们提了个口号，叫“大战百里滩，平顺变江南”。我们公社和相近的社联合起来，在百里长的河滩左右，苦战了百天，修起了一百多个大小水库，五千二百多座谷坊（蓄水池），五十一座拦洪坝，五千六百条大小渠道，还打了一千九百多眼旱井。虽说还没有真正变成江南，但有了水了。
    再看“火”。过去说平顺缺“火”，主要是指缺燃料。我们找见煤矿了，正在开采，有煤还不能点着火吗？不但有了“火”，在太行山顶上也有电了。在一些公社里电灯照得通亮，有的还用电来干活。
    最后说到“土”。山大平少，石厚土薄，原来就是这样。人们种地是担土造地，垒成梯田。可是山上少树缺草，一遇大雨，水带着土就流跑啦！因此，人们常说：“光山秃岭没林坡，干石河滩没闹头，旱涝风雹年年有，庄稼十年九不收。”现在情况就大变了。全部耕地地埂化，镶上了框子，封山育林、挖鱼鳞坑、修水库，基本上控制住了水土的流失。有了水土，才好长庄稼，产量才能步步登高。解放前，亩产一百八十斤；在一九五一年的互助组时期，每亩就产到二百四十二斤；在一九五七年农业合作社时期，产量增到四百六十一斤；一九五八年就大跃进了，亩产量突增到八百零三斤。这个数目，在先前连想都不敢想一下。
    各位代表，我说“五缺”变“五有”，的确是“有”了。但这个“有”，是初步地有，才铺个底子。我们决不自满松劲，在一九五九年要更大的跃进，年年要大跃进，把小有变成大有，一直到有了共产主义。
    各位代表，当着“五缺”变“五有”的时候，我们就想这是怎样变来的呢？有人说是人们劳动变来的，这话不假。可是从前也是这块地方，也是这末些人，也在劳动，为什么“变”不来呢？这样追到底，我明白了，原来是我们有了个社会主义的好社会。这个好社会是谁领导建立的？我们的党、我们的领袖毛主席。这一连串的道理，我们农民们一肚子清楚。所以，大家是那样热爱社会主义，热爱人民公社，是那样的拥护党，拥护毛主席。听说世界上有个杜勒斯，还有些杂七杂八的人，在骂我们，说我们的坏话，那舌头在他嘴里长着，由他们骂去吧，舌头怎能挡住我们前进的道路呢？完了！
