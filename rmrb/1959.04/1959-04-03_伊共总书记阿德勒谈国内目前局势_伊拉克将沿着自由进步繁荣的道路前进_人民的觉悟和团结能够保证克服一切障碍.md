Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 1st: The General Secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party, Salam Adler, issued a statement on the current situation in Iraq, saying that as long as the Republic of Iraq continues to pursue its independent patriotic path and relies on the strength of the people, subversion, imperialist conspiracies, and attempts at aggression will continue. However, the people's awareness and vigilance, their unity with the army, coupled with the swift adoption of firm measures, will guarantee the overcoming of all obstacles and the victorious and unwavering continuation on the path of freedom, progress, and prosperity.
    His statement was published in "The People's Unity News."
    Adler said that after the failure of imperialism's plans to interfere in Iraq from the outside, it adopted the method of conducting activities from within. However, Iraq's policy of mobilizing the people, purging state institutions, preventing reactionaries from organizing, keeping the people and the army vigilant, and the correct stance adopted by leader Qasim, shattered a series of conspiracies. All events clearly demonstrate that these conspiracies were planned and participated in by Americans and other imperialists, their agents in the old regime, and feudal elements. Certain Arab reactionaries, especially the rulers of the United Arab Republic (UAR), and Zionists were all related to these conspiracies, which were stopped at the time and recently revealed in the People's Court.
    Adler pointed out that the enemies of the Republic are again preparing to launch plans for open interference and foreign aggression on the basis of strengthening cooperation with all forces opposed to the Republic of Iraq and its democratic liberation policy. The new plan is to make these conspiracies and aggressions appear to be conflicts of an "Arab internal" nature or "regional" disputes. Imperialists are "Arabizing" their policies in order to: First, divide the national forces within Iraq. Second, deceive the people of Arab countries and neutral nations. Third, they hope to create a complex situation that is difficult for friendly countries, especially the Soviet Union, and to erect obstacles to hinder them from providing Iraq with firm assistance when Iraq needs it to safeguard the independence of the Republic of Iraq.
    Adler said it is easy to link the activities of the aggressive Baghdad Pact (meetings in Karachi and Ankara), the concentration of troops by Iran and Turkey on the border, the movements of the British fleet, visits by Rountree and others, and the bilateral agreements signed by the United States with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, with the fact that the UAR rulers have launched a frenzied campaign against Iraq, against the Communist Party, and against the Soviet Union. He said that the Shawwaf conspiracy was the result of this plan. However, thanks to the vigilance of the national forces, their preparedness, and their unity under the leadership of Qasim, it was possible to isolate this conspiracy in Mosul and to strangle and eliminate it as soon as it arose. After this conspiracy, the Republic became stronger and more capable of fighting the imperialists and aggressors.
    When talking about the Iraqi Communist Party's policy regarding the National United Front, Adler said that the Iraqi Communist Party has always consistently implemented this policy. Due to the long-term experience gained by the Iraqi people in the national struggle, they clearly understand the significance and importance of the unity of national forces in the anti-imperialist struggle.
    Since the July 14th Revolution, the Iraqi Communists have emphasized the necessity of establishing a front, strengthening the unity of national forces, strengthening the base for defending the Republic, and advancing towards the realization of the goals of the revolution. We have done our utmost to strengthen this unity, despite the discriminatory attitude adopted towards us by some. We warned against the dangers of divisive policies and attitudes, and emphasized the necessity of establishing fraternal relations among all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces on the basis of ensuring equal opportunities for all national forces in enjoying freedom of rights.
    Speaking of the attitude that should be adopted towards some people who participated in the Shawwaf conspiracy under the banner of the National United Front, Adler pointed out that some people, like the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, betrayed the goals of the front from the very beginning of the revolution, and have finally degenerated to the most despicable degree of betraying the Republic. However, people should not equate all nationalists with those who call themselves "nationalists." An opportunity must be given to some people within the national forces so that they can actually prove that they are loyal to our Republican system. These brothers must be required to help the Republic in uncovering conspirators and punishing them. The masses must also be asked to help them and attract them back into their ranks. Because if these people are not united and are treated as conspirators and saboteurs, it is not in the interest of the Republic.
    Speaking of how to strengthen the activities of the National United Front to meet the needs of the current situation, Adler said that this front was established under the adverse conditions of terrorist suppression by imperialism, so it chose the path of narrow secret activities. It had no opportunity to truly mobilize the people and rely on mass organizations. However, at present, under the rule of the Republic (which relies to a large extent on the work of organizing the people and their will), the situation is completely different, especially after withdrawing from the Baghdad Pact. This requires studying the structure of the front and its working methods according to the new situation and possibilities. The front must formulate its program on the basis of the national democratic policies expressed by the vast majority of the people. This program should stipulate the outline of the policies of the Republic of Iraq under the leadership of Qasim.
    Adler outlined the Iraqi Communist Party's policy on national economic policy. He said that the enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party held in September 1958 emphasized the following economic demands: "Take necessary measures to promote our national economy, care about the people's livelihood issues, free our trade from the Sterling Area, strengthen the value of Iraqi currency, implement strict supervision of various oil companies and other imperialist companies and banks, and protect our people from their plunder, encourage national industry and national capital, eliminate the semi-feudal system of exploitation in rural areas, confiscate the land of those feudal traitors and large landowners who have been proven or will be proven to have cooperated with imperialists and conspirators, distribute these lands to farmers, restrict land ownership in order to guarantee the interests of farmers and small land owners, take measures to protect our working class from unemployment, and raise their wages, improve their working conditions and improve their living standards, abolish unjust taxes."
    He said that the Iraqi Communist Party also emphasized: "We must consolidate our economic relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries. They have proven to have a noble friendship with our people, and have proven their loyalty to cooperate with all countries willing to cooperate."
    He said that these are the outlines that we have proposed and strived for in the economic sphere. Obviously, the Republic government has already achieved great achievements in this regard. The task currently facing our country in the economic field is to strengthen this policy and implement it as soon as possible so that it can bring benefits to people of all classes.
    Adler emphasized that all national classes must and can unite on the basis of these demands to carry out the struggle to safeguard and defend the Republic. Obviously, these demands include the interests of all these national classes and the interests of national progress, as well as the interests of national development towards a better future. These demands are definitely not socialist demands.
    Speaking of the future policy of the Iraqi Communist Party in terms of relations with various Arab brother countries, Adler said that the Arab policy of the Iraqi Communist Party is based on the concept that Iraq is an inseparable part of the Arab countries, and the national democratic revolution in Iraq is a component of the Arab national democratic revolution. Now, the joint struggle against imperialism and its agents and against the reactionaries connects all Arab countries. The Arab nation is forging its common future in order to establish a unified, liberated, and democratic institution.
    On this basis, we once put forward the slogan of forming a federation with the UAR and Yemen after the revolution. This slogan is progressive and it is conducive to the cause of the Arab nation because it is based on the actual existing unity among these brotherly countries.
    He went on to say that, however, the events of recent months, especially the continuous conspiracies of certain rulers of the UAR against liberated Iraq, and their consistent actions with imperialism in this regard, and their intensification of their reactionary domestic policies, especially against the Syrian people, have undermined all possibilities of establishing closer relations at present. Therefore, when the rulers of the UAR insist on adopting a hostile attitude towards Iraq, a progressive unity policy should naturally fight against these rulers and promote the establishment of friendly relations and genuine unity between the two republics. This noble goal will undoubtedly first require the people of the UAR themselves to conduct struggles in Syria and Egypt. When their struggle is victorious, it will be possible to take new and reliable steps on a liberated and democratic basis for the benefit of the two Arab countries to strengthen the relationship between the people of the two republics.

    伊共总书记阿德勒谈国内目前局势
    伊拉克将沿着自由进步繁荣的道路前进
    人民的觉悟和团结能够保证克服一切障碍
    新华社巴格达1日电　伊拉克共产党总书记萨拉姆·阿德勒就伊拉克目前局势发表谈话说，只要伊拉克共和国继续奉行它的独立的爱国道路，只要它继续依靠人民的力量，颠复活动和帝国主义的阴谋及侵略的企图就会继续下去。但是，人民的觉悟和警惕性以及同军队的团结，再加上迅速采取的坚定措施将可保证克服一切障碍，胜利地、坚定不移地继续在自由、进步和繁荣的道路上前进。
      “人民团结报”刊载了他的这篇谈话。
    阿德勒说，帝国主义企图从外部干涉伊拉克的计划失败以后，便采取从内部进行活动的办法。但是，伊拉克所采取的动员人民、清洗国家机构，不让反动派组织起来，使人民和军队保持警惕的政策，以及领袖卡塞姆所采取的正确立场，粉碎了一系列的阴谋。一切事件清楚证明，这些阴谋都是美国人和其他帝国主义者，他们的在旧政权的代理人和封建分子所策划和参与的，阿拉伯的某些反动分子、特别是阿联的统治者以及犹太复国主义者都与当时被制止的而且最近在人民法庭上揭露的这些阴谋有关系。
    阿德勒指出，共和国的敌人再次准备在同反对伊拉克共和国及其民主解放政策的一切势力加强合作的基础上发动公开干涉和进行外国侵略的计划。新的计划是要使这些阴谋和侵略具有“阿拉伯内部”冲突的性质，或者具有“区域性”纠纷的性质。帝国主义者把政策“阿拉伯化”，以便：第一、分裂伊拉克内部的民族队伍。第二、欺骗阿拉伯各国人民和中立国家。第三、他们希望制造一种各友好国家、特别是苏联感到为难的复杂局面，并且树立障碍，阻挠它们在伊拉克需要援助的时候给予伊拉克坚定的援助来保障伊拉克共和国的独立。
    阿德勒说，人们很容易把侵略性的巴格达条约（在卡拉奇和安卡拉的会议）的活动，伊朗和土耳其在边境上集结军队，英国舰队的调动，朗特里和其他一些人的访问，美国同土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦签订的双边协定等这一方面同另一方面联系起来，那就是：阿联统治者展开了疯狂的活动来反对伊拉克、反对共产党和反对苏联。他说，沙瓦夫的阴谋就是这个计划的结果。但是，由于民族力量的警惕，它们的准备有素以及在卡塞姆领导下的团结一致，因此能够把这个阴谋在摩苏尔孤立起来，在它刚刚起来的时候即予以扼杀和消灭。经过这次阴谋，共和国变得更加强大了，更有能力同帝国主义者和侵略者斗争了。
    阿德勒在谈到伊拉克共产党关于民族统一阵线的政策时说，伊拉克共产党始终一贯地执行这个政策。由于伊拉克人民在民族斗争中所得到的长期经验，他们清楚地认识到在反帝斗争中民族力量团结的意义和重要性。
    伊拉克共产党人从7月14日革命开始以来就强调必须建立阵线，加强民族力量的团结，加强保卫共和国的基地，并且向前推进以实现革命的目的。我们尽我们的最大力量加强这个团结，尽管有人对我们采取了歧视的态度。我们警告要提防分裂政策和分裂态度的危险，并且强调必须在保证一切民族力量在享受自由权利方面机会均等的基础上，建立一切反帝和反封建力量的兄弟关系。
    谈到对一些在民族统一阵线旗帜下参加沙瓦夫阴谋活动的人应采取的态度，阿德勒指出，像阿拉伯复兴社会党这样一些人，从革命一开始就背叛了阵线的目标，最后已经堕落到背叛共和国的最卑鄙的程度。但是，人们不应该把所有的民族主义者和那些自称“民族主义者”等量齐观。必须给予民族力量中的一些人以机会以便使他们在实际上能够证明他们是忠于我们的共和国制度的。必须要求这些兄弟帮助共和国进行揭露阴谋分子和惩办他们的活动。还必须要求群众帮助他们，并且吸引他们再一次回到他们的队伍中来。因为如果不团结这些人，并且把他们当作阴谋分子和破坏分子看待，那是不符合共和国的利益的。
    谈到如何加强民族统一阵线的活动以符合目前局势需要的问题，阿德勒说，这个阵线是在帝国主义用恐怖镇压的手段进行统治的恶劣条件下成立的，因此选择了进行狭隘的秘密活动的道路。它没有机会真正地动员人民和依靠群众组织。但是，目前在共和国（它在很大程度上依靠组织人民的工作和他们的意愿）的统治下，情况就完全不同了，特别是在退出巴格达条约以后。这就必须根据新的情况和可能性研究阵线的结构和它的工作方法。阵线必须以绝大多数人民群众表示的民族民主政策为基础来制定它的纲领，这个纲领应该规定在卡塞姆领导下的伊拉克共和国的政策的大纲。
    阿德勒概述了伊拉克共产党在国家经济政策方面的政策。他说，在1958年9月举行的伊拉克共产党的中央委员会扩大全体会议曾强调了下述几项经济要求：“采取必要的措施来促进我们的国民经济，关心群众的生活问题，使我国的贸易摆脱英镑集团，加强伊拉克货币的价值，对各石油公司和其他帝国主义公司及银行实行严格的监督，并保障我们的人民不受它们的掠夺，鼓励民族工业和民族资本，消灭在乡村地区的半封建性的剥削制度，没收那些已经被证明是或者将被证明是同帝国主义和阴谋分子合作的封建卖国贼和大地主的土地，把这些土地分配给农民，限制土地所有权，以便保证农民和小土地所有者的利益，采取措施来保障我们的工人阶级免于失业，并提高他们的工资，改善他们的劳动条件和提高他们的生活水平，废除不公正的捐税。”
    他说，伊拉克共产党还强调说：“必须巩固我们同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的经济关系，它们已经证明了对我国人民怀有崇高的友谊，并且证明他们忠诚要同一切愿意合作的国家合作。”
    他说，这些是我们在经济方面提出的和为之奋斗的大纲。显然，共和国政府已经在这方面取得了巨大的成就。目前我国在经济方面面临的任务就是加强这个政策，尽快地执行这个政策，以便它能够为一切阶级的人民带来好处。
    阿德勒强调指出，一切民族阶级必须而且能够在这些要求的基础上团结起来，进行保障和保卫共和国的斗争。很明显，这些要求包括了所有这些民族阶级的利益和国家进步的利益，以及国家朝着更好的前途发展的利益。这些要求绝对不是社会主义的要求。
    谈到伊拉克共产党在同各阿拉伯兄弟国家关系方面今后的政策，阿德勒说，伊拉克共产党的阿拉伯政策是以这样的概念作为基础的：伊拉克是阿拉伯国家的不可分割的部分，伊拉克的民族民主革命是阿拉伯民族民主革命的组成部分。现在，反对帝国主义及其代理人和反对反动派的联合斗争把各阿拉伯国家联系在一起。阿拉伯民族正在缔造它的共同的前途，以便建立一个统一的、解放了的民主机构。
    在这个基础上，我们在革命后曾经提出同阿联和也门结成联邦的口号。这个口号是进步的，它有利于阿拉伯民族的事业，因为它是以这些兄弟国家中间实际存在的团结为基础的。
    他接着说，但是，近几个月来的事态，特别是阿联某些统治者不断对解放了的伊拉克进行阴谋活动，而且他们在这方面同帝国主义采取了一致行动，他们加紧了他们的反动的国内政策、特别是针对叙利亚人民的反动政策，这些事实破坏了目前建立较密切的关系的一切可能性。因此，当阿联的统治者坚持对伊拉克采取敌对态度的时候，进步的团结政策自然应该对这些统治者进行斗争，并且促使这两个共和国之间建立友好关系和真正的团结。这个崇高的目标无疑将首先要求阿联人民自己在叙利亚和埃及进行斗争。当他们的斗争获得胜利的时候，就会有可能在解放了的民主的基础上为这两个阿拉伯国家的利益而采取新的可靠步骤，来加强两个共和国的人民之间的关系。
