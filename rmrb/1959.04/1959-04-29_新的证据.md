Lies built on falsehoods will inevitably be exposed by more and more facts, leaving the slanderers in an increasingly embarrassing situation.

The documents seized from the rebel headquarters in Tibet and the so-called "Oath of the Tibetan Buddhist Association" circulated abroad by Tibetan rebels (both in this newspaper on April 28) once again expose the blatant lies of Indian expansionists who attack our country for not complying with the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, while claiming that the Tibetan reactionary group did comply with the agreement. At the same time, they also expose the extreme hypocrisy of the Indian expansionists' sophistry that they did not interfere in China's internal affairs.

The documents prove that the Tibetan reactionary group has always opposed national regional autonomy and has been carrying out a conspiracy to split the motherland and make Tibet "independent." The "Opinions of Nangma Kanchen Khenpo" states: "The future direction must ensure that Tibet's ethnicity, religion, language, writing, and other historical aspects are undoubtedly suitable for an independent country." The "Opinions of the Three Great Monasteries" also states: "In the future, the joint Han-Tibetan conference headed by the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region is also unnecessary. We will manage our own affairs." The so-called "Tibetan Independence Conference" even declared on March 10, the day the rebellion was launched, that "the independent state of Tibet has been established." In fact, according to the "Oath of the Tibetan Buddhist Association," the Tibetan reactionary group had already described Tibet as the "most wonderful independent country with a combination of politics and religion, political system, and customs" in the first half of 1958. Isn't this proof that the Tibetan reactionary group has consistently obstructed, undermined, and torn up the Seventeen-Article Agreement?

These rebellious documents fully confirm the facts revealed by the Panchen Erdeni in his speech at the National People's Congress: What the Tibetan reactionary group "wants is not the autonomous rights of Tibet, but the so-called 'independence' of Tibet. In fact, it is not the 'independence' of Tibet, but an attempt to sell out the country for personal glory under the guise of 'independence' in order to maintain their reactionary rule."

At the same time, these documents fully confirm Panchen's accusation: "The Indian reactionaries have inherited the mantle of British imperialism, and have always harbored expansionist ambitions towards Tibet, and have carried out various destructive activities." Look at this! In two secret telegrams from the "Tibetan Independence Conference" to Shagapa, the leader of the rebel organization "Tibetan Welfare Undertaking Association" in Kalimpong, they were asked to "announce to everyone" that "the independent state of Tibet has been established," and to "report to the neighboring Indian government, the Buddhist Conference, and the United Nations, immediately send representatives here to observe the true situation, and please find a way to inform the Indian representative in Lhasa to understand the situation in advance." The so-called "Oath of the Tibetan Buddhist Association" was also published in the "Tibetan Mirror" in Kalimpong, and the "Tibetan Mirror" also reported on the activities of the rebels in Kalimpong.

Where there is fire, there is smoke; where there is singing, there is harmony. The Indian expansionists and these Tibetan reactionaries are truly singing in perfect harmony. Before and after this, they also clamored to support Tibet's "independence" and demanded that the United Nations intervene. Indian Socialist Party leader Narayan publicly declared at the "India Support Tibet Committee" that India should "unanimously declare that Tibet should be an independent country." This committee issued a statement calling for the Tibetan issue to be submitted to the United Nations. Indian High Commissioner to London, Mrs. Pandit, also said: "What I am concerned about is whether Tibet, India, and other countries have the ability to resist countries that want to rule (China's rule over Tibet)." Do these remarks, compared with the above-mentioned documents, not explain the problem well?

Furthermore, these documents once again fully confirm that the Dalai Lama was abducted. In the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," it is insisted that the Tibetan local government "has made its best efforts to abide by the Seventeen-Article Agreement," and that the Dalai Lama's departure from Lhasa was "out of his own free will and not because he was abducted." However, the documents show that it was the Tibetan rebels who tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and also show that the reactionaries held a "People's Representative Conference" in Norbulingka to declare Tibet's "independence," and that "preventing the Dalai Lama from going out (to see a play at the military district auditorium)" made the Dalai Lama very angry and he "flew into a rage." This proves that the Dalai Lama opposed the rebellion, and that throughout the rebellion, he completely lost the freedom to express his "free will."

Therefore, how can it be said that claiming that Kalimpong is the command center of the Tibetan rebellion is "too wishful thinking and disregards the obvious facts"?

Therefore, how can it be "an inappropriate and completely unfounded accusation" to say that Indian expansionists are in line with the Tibetan "independence" conspiracy?

Therefore, how can it be "an irresponsible accusation" to say that the so-called Dalai Lama's statement was imposed by foreign countries and that the Dalai Lama was abducted?

    新的证据
    胡今
    建立在谎言的基础上的诬蔑，一定会被越来越多的事实所揭穿，使诬蔑者自己陷于越来越狼狈的局面。
    我军从西藏叛匪司令部缴获的文件和西藏叛乱分子在国外散发的所谓“西藏佛教协会誓约”（均见4月28日本报），再次揭穿了印度扩张主义分子攻击我国不遵守和平解放西藏十七条协议，而倒是西藏反动集团遵守了协议的漫天谎言；同时也揭穿了印度扩张主义分子所谓他们并没有干涉中国内政的诡辩的极端虚伪性。
    文件证明：西藏反动集团一直反对民族区域自治，进行着分裂祖国的要使西藏“独立”的阴谋。“囊玛堪钦堪穷的意见书”说：“今后的方向，西藏的种族、宗教、语言文字等各方面历史均一定要使其无疑问的适于独立国家”。“三大寺的意见书”也说：“今后以自治区筹委会为首的汉藏联合会议亦不需要，我们自己管理自己的事”。所谓“西藏独立会议”，更在3月10日即发动叛乱的当天，宣布“西藏独立国已经成立”。事实上，根据“西藏佛教协会誓约”，西藏反动集团早在1958年上半年就把西藏说成是“政教合一、政治制度和风俗习惯最美妙的独立国家”了。这难道不是西藏反动集团一贯阻挠、破坏和撕毁十七条协议的证明吗？
    这些叛乱文件完全证实了班禅额尔德尼在全国人民代表大会上的发言中所揭露的事实：西藏反动集团“所要的不是什么西藏的自治权利，而是西藏的所谓‘独立’，事实上也不是什么西藏的‘独立’，而是企图借‘独立’的招牌来卖国求荣，来维持他们的反动统治。”
    同时，这些文件完全证实了班禅的这个指责：“印度的反动派继承了英帝国主义的衣钵，一直对西藏存在扩张野心，并且进行种种破坏活动”。且看吧！“西藏独立会议”给噶伦堡的叛乱组织“西藏幸福事业会”领导人夏格巴的两封密电中，要他们“向大家宣布”“西藏独立国已经成立”，并“向邻国印度政府、佛教会议、联合国报告，立即派代表来此观察真实情况，并请设法电印度驻拉萨代表应于事先了解情况等”。所谓“西藏佛教协会誓约”也是在噶伦堡出版的“西藏镜报”发表的，“西藏镜报”还报道了叛匪在噶伦堡的活动情况。
    有火必有烟，有唱必有和。印度扩张主义分子和这些西藏的反动分子真是唱和得十分合拍。在此前后，他们也大肆叫嚷支持西藏“独立”、要求联合国干涉。印度社会党领袖纳拉扬在“印度支援西藏委员会”上公然宣称：印度应当“异口同声地宣布西藏应当是独立的国家”。这个委员会发表声明，呼吁把西藏问题提交联合国。印度驻伦敦高级专员潘迪特夫人也说：“我关心的是西藏、印度和其他国家是否有能力起来抵抗想进行统治的国家（中国对西藏的统治）。”这些言论同上述文件对照来看，不是很能说明问题吗？
    还有，这些文件又一次完全证实了达赖喇嘛是被劫持的。在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中，硬说西藏地方政府“曾经尽最大力量来遵守十七条协议”，达赖离开拉萨是“出于他自己的自由意志，而不是被劫持”。但文件说明了是西藏叛乱分子撕毁了十七条协议，也说明了反动分子们在罗布林卡举行宣布西藏“独立”的“人民代表会议”，并“阻挡达赖喇嘛出行（到军区礼堂看戏）”的事，都曾使达赖喇嘛很生气，并且“发怒了”。这证明达赖喇嘛是反对叛乱活动的，并且在整个叛乱过程中，他根本就失去了表达“自由意志”的自由。
    因此，说噶伦堡是西藏叛乱的指挥中心，怎能说是“未免太想入非非而不顾明显的事实”呢？
    因此，说印度扩张主义分子同西藏“独立”阴谋一脉相通，又怎能是“不适当而又完全没有根据的指责”呢？
    因此，说所谓达赖喇嘛声明是外国强加的，达赖是被劫持的，这又怎能是“不负责任的指责”呢？
