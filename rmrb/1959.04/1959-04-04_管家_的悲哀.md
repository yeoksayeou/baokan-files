Notes:

    The Sadness of a "Butler"
    Spaak, the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, who is known as America's "butler" in Western Europe, published an article in the latest issue of the American "Foreign Affairs Quarterly," issuing an unusual lament, and had to admit that the real weakness of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the disunity of its member states.
    Spaak truly deserves to be Uncle Sam's loyal "butler." He loudly called for the cancellation of the so-called "opposition from stubborn nationalism and individualism within the alliance" as a "reasonable solution" to the problem of disunity. The prescription that Spaak offered is nothing new. He has always clamored for the members of the "Atlantic Alliance" to abandon nationalism and submit to so-called "supranational control," in order to achieve "unity" at the expense of each country's sovereignty. Obviously, this is to "unify" under American control. However, the "unity" promoted by Spaak has not had any effect. On the contrary, many partners in the "Atlantic Alliance" are resisting American control more and more strongly. This is Spaak's sorrow, and also the sorrow of the North Atlantic Group.

### “管家”的悲哀

    “管家”的悲哀
    号称美国在西欧的“管家”的北大西洋公约组织秘书长斯巴克，在最近一期美国“外交季刊”上发表文章，发出了异乎寻常的哀鸣，不得不承认北大西洋公约组织的真正弱点是成员国的不团结。
    斯巴克真不愧是山姆大叔的忠实“管家”，他大声疾呼要求取消所谓“联盟内顽固的民族主义和个人主义势力的反对”，作为解决不团结问题的“合理办法”。斯巴克开的这张方子，并不是什么新鲜玩意儿。他过去一直就叫喊要“大西洋联盟”成员国，放弃民族主义，服从所谓“超民族的控制”，以牺牲各国的主权来实现“统一”。很显然，这就是要“统一”到美国的控制之下。然而斯巴克鼓吹的“统一”并没有收到什么效果，相反的，“大西洋联盟”的许多伙伴对美国的控制的抗拒越来越强烈。这正是斯巴克的悲哀，也是北大西洋集团的悲哀。
