Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: Chemical industry workers should vigorously tap the potential of existing production enterprises, launch a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, accelerate the pace of capital construction, and give full play to the role of small-scale local and foreign chemical enterprises to meet the requirements of industrial construction for chemical industrial products. This was the call made at the recent joint meeting of the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Ministry of Commerce on balancing and distributing chemical industrial products.

The meeting made comprehensive arrangements for the production and distribution of chemical industrial products in the second quarter. The production plan for chemical products in the second quarter will increase significantly compared with the first quarter. General products will increase by more than 30%, and major products such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, soda ash, and caustic soda will increase by 32% to 47%. Products such as acetone and butanol will more than double.

In order to ensure the completion of this plan, the meeting required the chemical industry departments (bureaus) of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as chemical enterprises across the country, to firmly grasp production, grasp it hard, grasp it practically, and grasp it tightly. It is necessary to strengthen command and dispatching, supervise and inspect, and complete the work plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. Within enterprises, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out technological revolution, and launch a competition movement centered on high yield and high quality, so as to hand over the second quarter plan and the key issues and difficulties in completing this plan to workshops, sections, production teams, and all workers and staff members for discussion, so that everyone can tap potential and find solutions. At the same time, it is necessary to take measures from political, economic, technical, and organizational aspects to break through the weak links in production, and through technical innovation, focus on reducing consumption quotas and saving raw materials. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the recycling and utilization of chemical industry raw materials and try every possible means to develop and utilize new raw materials. In terms of capital construction, it is necessary to implement the policy of "concentrating forces, focusing on key points," and combining large, medium, and small-sized projects, as well as local and foreign methods, to accelerate the progress of capital construction, do a good job in finishing works, and strive to put them into production as soon as possible.

Regarding the distribution of chemical products, the meeting determined that priority should be given to ensuring the needs of the four major indicators, followed by ensuring the needs of other key areas. Appropriate arrangements must also be made for the needs of light industry, the market, and other aspects. In terms of product distribution methods, for several major chemical raw materials, it was decided to adopt the method of "one line to the bottom," that is, distributing raw materials to grassroots enterprises according to industry.

Regarding major chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, soda ash, caustic soda, and raw rubber, the meeting made arrangements by department and industry, and also made arrangements for the main uses of each department.

The meeting also studied the division of labor and management of chemical products between industrial and commercial departments.

　　化工部等单位安排二季度产品生产和分配
　　首先保证四大指标需要
    据新华社15日讯　化工部门职工应当大力挖掘现有生产企业的潜力，大搞增产节约运动，加快基本建设速度，充分发挥小型土洋化工企业的作用，以满足工业建设对化学工业产品的要求。这是国家计划委员会、化学工业部、外贸部和商业部最近联合召开的化学工业产品平衡分配会议所提出的号召。
    会议对第二季度化学工业产品的生产和分配作了全面安排。第二季度化工产品的生产计划比一季度有较大的增长，一般的产品都将增长30％以上，其中主要产品如硫酸、硝酸、纯碱、烧碱等要增长32％到47％，丙酮、丁醇等产品增长一倍以上。
    为了保证完成这个计划，会议要求各省、市、自治区化工厅（局）和全国各化工企业，必须紧紧地抓生产，要抓得狠、抓得实、抓得紧，要加强指挥调度，督促检查，按日按旬按月地完成作业计划。在企业内部要充分发动群众，大搞技术革命，掀起以高产优质为中心的竞赛运动，把二季度计划和完成这个计划的关键问题和困难，交给车间、工段、生产小组和全体职工群众讨论，让大家来挖潜力、想办法。同时，要从政治、经济、技术和组织各方面采取措施，突破生产中的薄弱环节，并且要通过技术革新，突出地抓紧降低消耗定额，节约原材料。此外，要加强化学工业原料的回收利用和千方百计地开辟、利用新的原材料。在基本建设方面，必须贯彻“集中力量、突击重点”和大中小相结合、土洋结合的方针，加快基本建设的进度，搞好扫尾工程，力争早日投入生产。
    关于化工产品的分配，会议确定首先要保证四大指标的需要，其次是保证其他重点的需要；对轻工业、市场和其他方面的需要，也必须作适当安排。在产品分配方法上，对若干主要化工原料，决定采取一竿子插到底的方法，即按行业归口，把原料分配给基层企业。
    关于硫酸、硝酸、纯碱、烧碱、生胶等主要化工原料，会议在按部门、按行业进行安排的同时，还就每一部门的主要用途作了安排。
    会议还研究了工业部门与商业部门对化工产品的分工管理问题。
