    Insulting Our Great Leader Is a Grave Provocation to 600 Million People
    Broad Masses of Workers and Peasants in Our Country Angrily Denounce Interferers
    (Reported by our newspaper) In recent days, the broad masses of workers and peasants throughout the country have held meetings and discussions, strongly condemning the British imperialists and Indian expansionists for instigating the Tibetan rebellion and supporting the Tibetan traitorous clique in splitting China. The broad masses of staff, workers, and commune members of the people's communes in various regions are particularly indignant at the fact that the Bombay police authorities in India connived at thugs insulting the image of our great leader Chairman Mao. They unanimously pointed out that insulting our beloved leader is a serious incident and a grave provocation to the 650 million Chinese people. The Chinese people will not tolerate such a brazen act of provocation.
    Beijing
    More than 40,000 farmers in the Sijiqing People's Commune in Beijing were extremely angered upon hearing the news that Indian expansionists were deviating from the spirit of the Bandung Conference, undermining the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, instigating the Tibetan rebellion, and interfering in China's internal affairs. In symposiums and broadcast rallies, they sternly warned the Indian expansionists and strongly protested against the atrocities of the Bombay police authorities in India for condoning thugs to insult the image of our great leader Chairman Mao.
    Comrade Li Molin, a national model worker, said: "Tibet is an inseparable part of our country. The Indian expansionists' attempt to split our country is bound to end in shameful failure."
    At the broadcast rally held by the commune on the evening of the 25th, Chen Fu, the deputy captain of the Luodaozhuang Production Brigade, warned the Indian expansionists: "Your attempt to separate Tibet from China is like trying to catch the moon in the water – a futile effort." Gao Cunshuang, the production captain of the Landianchang Production Team, said: "The Indian expansionists should be smarter; it is not too late to rein in at the edge of the cliff now; otherwise, they will definitely meet a shameful end."
    Cao Chun, the director of the refractory brick factory of the Xiangshan Production Brigade, entrusted by the workers, made a special trip to the broadcast rally to report on the production competition launched by the workers of their factory to oppose the Indian expansionists' interference in China's internal affairs. He said that they guarantee to build a large furnace with a capacity of 30,000 refractory bricks per furnace before May 1st. The workers are now in high spirits. Previously, a worker could only roll dozens of blanks a day, but after intensifying technical improvements in the past few days, they suddenly jumped to more than 700. The workers expressed their determination to produce more refractory bricks to produce more steel to consolidate national defense and support the construction of a new Tibet.
    The commune members of this commune expressed their boundless anger at the Indian police's instigation of thugs to insult the image of our leader Chairman Mao. Guo Xing, an old farmer of sixty-eight years old, told everyone he met that the arrogant behavior of those bad guys in India who insulted our savior Chairman Mao was simply intolerable.
   Wuhan The entire workforce of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's Ironmaking Plant expressed unparalleled resentment toward British imperialism and Indian expansionists for planning the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in China's internal affairs. Li Feng'en, a renowned model worker and director of the blast furnace workshop at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's Ironmaking Plant, stated: It is known to people around the world that Tibet has been an inseparable part of China's territory since ancient times. However, the expansionist elements of India are clamoring that Tibet is an "independent country", and slandering China's actions in Tibet as endangering the unity of Asia, and so on. They exerted every effort to support a small number of rebellious elements in Tibet to kidnap the Dalai Lama to India, and fabricated so-called "declarations by the Dalai Lama." They vainly attempted to obstruct the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion, attempted to undermine our nation's unity, and to turn Tibet into their colony. Recently, the police authorities in Bombay, India, also condoned their so-called "demonstrators," and openly insulted the image of Chairman Mao, the most beloved leader of our people, in front of our consulate. This is an insult to China's 650 million people, and a serious act of provocation against our nation. We cannot tolerate this. He stated, we are warning the expansionist elements of India: The days when imperialism could run amok in our country are over. The Chinese people cannot be intimidated by any amount of clamoring. The entire workforce of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's Ironmaking Plant guarantees to use the practical actions of fulfilling and exceeding the production targets for pig iron, and work together with the steelworkers across the nation, to strive to produce 18 million tons of steel this year, and to strengthen the power to defend world peace.
    Chengdu
    Zhou Wenyi, an advanced producer in Chengdu and deputy director of the steelmaking workshop at the Chengdu Iron and Steel Plant, said: The Indian expansionists are constantly issuing statements attacking our country, and they even dared to publicly insult the image of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. All of us steelworkers feel incredibly angry. The actions of the Indian expansionist elements have clearly exposed their ugly and shameless faces. No matter how arrogant they are, the people of Tibet and the people of all ethnic groups in our country will certainly take the bright road of socialism!
    Jilin
    The more than 30,000 employees of the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company have held meetings for days, seriously warning the Indian expansionists. They are determined to use the practical action of over-fulfilling the April plan to fight back against the Indian expansionists. Women from all walks of life in Changchun City have also held discussions. Female workers Guan Shufan, Li Yuzhi, and others said: Quelling the Tibetan rebellion is our internal affair. The Indian expansionist elements want to stick their noses into the Tibet issue and will definitely get a bloody nose. Liu Anrong, an old woman worker from the Jilin Normal University Clothing Factory, said: The thugs in Bombay, India, insulted Chairman Mao, which is an insult to our 650 million Chinese people. This is a serious provocation to us, and we firmly protest this atrocity.
    Shandong
    The people of Jinan, Qingdao, and other places have held rallies and symposiums in recent days, warmly supporting the speeches of many delegates at the National People's Congress who condemned the Indian expansionist elements for interfering in our internal affairs. The staff and workers of the steelmaking workshop of Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant believe that insulting the great leader of our people is insulting our 650 million people and must be firmly protested.
    Lanzhou
    At the symposium, the workers of the Gansu Farm Implement Factory in Lanzhou said: We want to warn the Indian expansionist elements: Tibet is forever an inseparable part of China, and anyone who wants to use the Tibetan rebellion to realize their expansionist ambitions is just wishful thinking. Zhou Guanxian, an old worker in the processing workshop, said: The Indian expansionist elements have miscalculated. Anyone who wants to realize their expansionist ambitions against the new China will inevitably be left with a broken head and bleeding face! The staff and workers of the Lanzhou Thermal Power Equipment Plant angrily protested against the Indian expansionist elements' conspiracy to interfere in our internal affairs and the provocative act of insulting the image of our beloved leader Chairman Mao. Worker Xie Liren said: Quelling the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair, and no foreigner has the right to interfere; but the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements colluded with the traitorous clique to plan the Tibetan rebellion, vainly attempting to split China's unity. Recently, the Indian People's Socialist Party openly insulted the image of our beloved leader Chairman Mao with the connivance of the Indian police, which further exposed the aggressive ambitions of the Indian expansionist elements. All the staff and workers of the factory unanimously stated that they would take practical actions to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and over-fulfill the production plan to support the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion.
    All the members of the Datong People's Commune in Yongdeng District, Lanzhou City, are extremely angry at the conspiracy of the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements to interfere in our internal affairs and undermine China's unity. The members of the Datong Production Brigade proposed to support the People's Liberation Army in quickly and thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion with practical actions to produce more grain and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture.

    全国劳动模范李墨林同志说：“西藏是我国不可分割的一部分，印度扩张主义分子妄想分裂我国的阴谋，一定要遭到可耻的失败。”
    在25日晚上公社召开的广播大会上，罗道庄生产大队副大队长陈福警告印度扩张主义分子：“你们想把西藏从中国分裂出去，这是水里捞月，枉费心机”。蓝靛厂生产队长高存双说：“印度扩张主义分子应放聪明些，现在悬崖勒马还不迟，不然一定会遭到可耻的下场。”
    香山生产大队耐火砖厂的厂长曹春受工人委托特地跑到广播大会上报告他们厂工人为反对印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政而展开的生产竞赛情况。他说，他们保证在5月1日以前建成一座每炉出三万块耐火砖的大炉。现在工人生产情绪很高，以前一个工人每天只能轧几十块坯子，这几天加紧改进技术后，一下子跃到七百多块，工人们表示要生产更多的耐火砖，以便生产更多的钢铁来巩固国防，支援建设新西藏。
    这个公社社员们对印度警察怂恿暴徒侮辱我国领袖毛主席像，表示无比愤怒。六十八岁的老农郭兴见人就说，印度那些侮辱我们救命恩人毛主席的坏家伙的狂妄行为，使我们简直不能容忍。武　钢武钢炼铁厂全体职工对英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策划西藏叛乱干涉我国内政表示无比的愤恨。著名劳动模范、武钢炼铁厂高炉车间主任李凤恩说：全世界人民都知道，西藏自古以来就是我国领土不可分割的一部分，而印度的扩张主义分子却叫嚣什么西藏是“独立国家”，诬蔑中国在西藏的行动危害亚洲的团结，等等。他们竭力支持西藏一小撮叛乱分子劫持达赖喇嘛前往印度，并且制造所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，他们妄想阻挡人民解放军平息叛乱，妄想破坏我国的统一，把西藏变为他们的殖民地。最近，印度孟买警察当局又纵容他们的什么“示威者”，公然在我国领事馆前，侮辱我国人民最敬爱的领袖毛主席的像，这是对我国六亿五千万人民的侮辱，是对我国的一种严重的挑衅行为，我们不能容忍。他说，我们警告印度扩张主义分子，帝国主义在我国横行霸道的日子已经过去了，中国人民是任何叫嚣都吓不倒的。我们武钢炼铁厂全体职工保证以完成和超额完成生铁生产任务的实际行动和全国钢铁职工一起，共同努力在今年夺取一千八百万吨钢，增强保卫世界和平的力量。
