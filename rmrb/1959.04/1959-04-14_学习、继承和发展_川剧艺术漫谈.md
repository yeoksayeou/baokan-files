　　Learning, Inheritance, and Development
　　——A Discussion on Sichuan Opera Art
　　Xi Mingzhen
Under the guidance of the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new" for opera work, Sichuan Opera art is continuously improving and progressing.

Sichuan Opera, like many other ancient opera forms, has a deep traditional foundation. Whether from the perspective of dramatic literature, opera music, or performing arts, it preserves a great deal of the spiritual wealth created by earlier artists and is one of the treasures of the motherland's art. Therefore, it is very important work to excavate and organize traditional art, inherit these traditional arts in a timely manner, and enrich and refine them from the traditional foundation to seek further development. As an apprentice in the art of opera, I deeply appreciate the positive significance of this work.

There was a time when performing troupes paid more attention to theater performances and relaxed the excavation and organization of traditional repertoire, resulting in a relatively monotonous repertoire. Some comrades kindly criticized this shortcoming, while pointing out that not working hard to excavate the traditional repertoire and constantly complaining about the lack of repertoire is like "begging with a golden rice bowl." Therefore, starting in 1954, under the leadership of the Party, specialized institutions for managing excavation and organization work were established in Chengdu and Chongqing: the Sichuan Opera Repertoire Appraisal Committee. With the help of the Central Ministry of Culture and the national literary and art circles, work was actively carried out. Over the past few years, Sichuan opera workers have made great efforts and achieved certain results. From its establishment in 1955 to 1958, the Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Theater collected more than 1,400 traditional large-scale repertoire. Last year, the Sichuan People's Publishing House published nine volumes of the "Compilation of Traditional Repertoire" edited by the Sichuan Opera Theater, including thirty-six traditional repertoire, totaling about 1.8 million words. At the same time, a selection of works by the late Sichuan Opera writer Huang Ji'an was compiled into a book, collecting seventeen scripts, totaling about 700,000 words. This work has been encouraged by the Party and literary and art circles, so a more ambitious plan has been put forward this year, preparing to continue editing 8 million words of traditional repertoire, which will be jointly completed by Sichuan opera workers in Chengdu and Chongqing.

The achievements made in excavation and organization work have enriched the repertoire of the troupes, encouraged the enthusiasm of Sichuan opera workers, and at the same time, provided many excellent repertoire for the drama circles, adding a splendid color to the stage.

It is worth mentioning that Sichuan opera artists are particularly good at using exaggerated comedy techniques to deal with serious themes, and in those excellent scripts, romanticism and realism can be cleverly combined. Therefore, in depicting the lives and struggles of the ancient people, as well as expressing the wishes of the ancient people, it can be done vividly and realistically. However, due to historical limitations, traditional scripts have both flaws and merits, with both essence and dross existing side by side. How to extract the essence and discard the dross is an extremely complex and meticulous work. We must analyze and treat it with a historical and materialistic viewpoint. If simple methods are adopted, it will often be counterproductive and become "discarding the essence." For example, in the organization of "The Incense Burning Record," the two bailiffs and yamen runners who were knocked down by Jiao Guiying in the "Beating Gods and Praying to the Temple" scene were once considered to have destroyed the integrity of the tragedy and were retired from the stage for a long time.

Originally, after this pair of clay sculptures of little ghosts were knocked down, they stood up again. The actors used the techniques of swaying puppets and shadow puppets to perform, which precisely showed the mental activity of the extremely painful Jiao Guiying and her absent-mindedness. On a stage with limited time and space, being able to carve the inner world of the characters in such a concise way is a quite outstanding technique. However, we only saw the vulgarity of the little ghosts' lyrics and therefore negated it. For example, when Wang Kui joined the Han Prime Minister's mansion, after the wedding ceremony, the maid carrying the red candles to send the newlyweds to the bridal chamber was traditionally played by Jiao Guiying. When Wang Kui saw this maid, he realized that her figure and appearance were similar to Jiao Guiying, whom he had abandoned. Therefore, he suspected; he was afraid, timid, and full of doubts. He stared blankly at the maid, lost in thought, forgetting to move. In the eyes of this maid, however, she felt that this groom was very rude. He had just come to the Prime Minister's mansion and had just worshiped and saluted the young lady, but he was so dishonest. So, she got a little angry, kicked her foot, and said, "What are you looking at? We are servants!" The sound of a heavy percussion instrument woke Wang Kui up. This is also a profound revelation of the inner activities of the characters in the play. This and the scene of Hua Rong shooting an eagle in "Fan Wang Palace," where Hua Rong went to act as a cart driver, letting the amorous Yelv Hanyan see him as her sweetheart, one is writing about the passionate infatuation of a girl, and the other is writing about the criminal psychology of a heartless man, both can be perfect in their own way. There is no doubt that this is an artistic exaggeration based on life, which is essence rather than dross. For example, the musical piece in the "Beating Gods" scene is even more the impassioned and tragic "End Rightly," and when beating the yamen runners, it was once modified into a "Moth to the Lamp" that was close to recitation. Therefore, in expressing Jiao Guiying's anger at being insulted and harmed, it reduced a lot of the heart-stirring passion and also reduced the moving power of the tragedy to a certain extent.

Using comedic exaggeration to express serious tragic themes, the most representative script should be "Forced Marriage." "Forced Marriage" is an exposé of the inhumane "beauty pageant" system of the feudal era. Feudal rulers, for their own selfish desires, disregarded the suffering of people's wives and children being separated and arbitrarily selected young women from the people to enter the palace as slaves. This was originally an outrageous thing. Excellent artists used their flowery brushes to profoundly and vividly expose the cruel and corrupt nature of this system through the different experiences of three households of different status – the county magistrate, the local ruling class authority, the wealthy gentry, and the commoners who made a living by performing in the streets.

It is worth mentioning the collection and organization of works by the late Sichuan Opera writer Huang Ji'an.

Huang Ji'an was an important Sichuan Opera writer in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. His plays are very rich, and the Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Theater has collected about seventy of his scripts. Sichuan Opera performers respect Huang Ji'an's plays very much and call them "Huang Ben" (Huang's scripts). The characteristics of Huang Ben are that the writing is smooth and easy to understand, and both elegant and popular tastes are appreciated. In particular, he dared to ridicule ancient powerful emperors to his heart's content. The recently organized and performed "Disturbing the Qi Court" was written by Huang Ji'an based on "Romance of the Eastern Zhou Dynasties" "Yan E'er climbed over the wall to show her integrity, and a group of princes made a big disturbance in the court." He used his sharp pen to puncture the ugly essence of the feudal rulers. When Duke Huan of Qi was critically ill, his several wives and several sons became enemies of each other and did not recognize their relatives in order to compete for the throne: "The dragon tower and phoenix pavilion became a battlefield, and it is common for brothers and sisters to kill each other," which nakedly exposed the ugliness of the feudal class. They even insulted the dying old man, their father and husband, to their heart's content, scolding him for being "old and not dying" and scolding him for "pretending to be dead to sell his life." For their own selfish interests, in order to oppose the hereditary throne, they also righteously said, "The eldest son succeeding to the throne will not work in Qi!" Because Duke Huan of Qi had once fought for the Jiangshan of Duke Jiu. It turned out that these feudal tyrants who seized the throne were nothing more than monkeys in crowns with white powder smeared on their noses in the eyes of the people's artists. Perhaps Huang Ji'an had a deep aversion to these feudal figures because he was born in an era when the Qing Dynasty collapsed, followed by a long period of civil war among Sichuan warlords. The excavation of this type of repertoire, which has been neglected for a long time, corrected the bias of only valuing Sheng Dan plays for a while. Moreover, it further improved the ideological level of Sichuan opera workers.

Of course, with a good script, there must also be excellent performing arts to reflect the spirit of the script. In the old society, the reactionary government severely destroyed Sichuan Opera art, and most of the old artists withered due to poverty. Since liberation, the Party has put forward the slogan of "rescuing" this work, calling on young actors to inherit the tradition. In this way, many special skills that had been buried in the old society for a long time can gradually be wiped away from the dust, and still shine brightly like pearls. For example, the "Flooding Jinshan Temple" performed in Beijing this time, the "lifting" dance used in it expresses Bai Niangzi's enthusiasm and beautiful sentiments; when Rao Bo Shen appeared and met Bai Shi, the special skill of changing faces was used several times, which made people more deeply aware of the ferocity of the feudal forces. These special skills, which were once considered to be the lifelong unique skills of the late Sichuan Opera famous actor Kang Zilin, of kicking into the "Weituo" eye with the toes and changing faces, were all inherited by young actors from their predecessors under the "liberation of thought, hard study and hard practice." In this process, the old performing methods of simply playing with skills divorced from the characters and the plot were also changed, so that these special skills could more concentratedly and prominently express the characters' personalities and help the development of the drama plot. For example, in "Stopping the Horse," Jiao Guangpu's chair work was only for personal showing off in the past. After hard research by young actors, it has basically been achieved to start from the characters and start from the plot, expressing Jiao Guangpu's humor and love for the motherland.

For example, the beautiful and poetic play "A Hundred Flowers Presenting a Sword" was also neglected for a long time in the past because of the vulgar taste in some performances.

Under the urging of the Party Committee, these unique skills were swept away from the dust that had been obscured in the old society, untied the mysterious veil, and regained their youth on the stage.

The development of Sichuan Opera is even more gratifying in the growth of a large number of young actors. The continuation of artistic life does not lie in the longevity of the actors themselves, but in having someone to inherit them. The Party Committee attaches great importance to this work. The Sichuan Opera Troupe that came to Beijing to perform this time concentrated some of the outstanding new forces from Chengdu, Chongqing, and several special zones. These young people have gone "up to the mountains and down to the countryside," and have gone through the "war for steel" movement. They understand the close relationship between art and labor, and art and politics. They are like flowers nurtured by the spring breeze and spring rain, full of vitality and blooming dazzlingly.

In addition to establishing the Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Experimental School, the Party Committee also regularly holds actor training classes in Chengdu and Chongqing, rotating actors for training. Since the Great Leap Forward, several special zones have held short-term institutions for training Sichuan Opera actors. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the amateur Sichuan Opera organizations, under the guidance of professional troupes, can almost combine production and timely compile the new people and new things that arise in labor into Sichuan Opera and perform them in a timely manner, reflecting the policy of literature and art serving politics and serving production. Professional troupes are more actively striving to express modern themes. For example, "Ding Youjun" performed in Chengdu last year and "One-Person Store Red Flag Flying" performed in Chongqing have been well received by the audience.

It should be said that our work of learning, inheritance, and development is only a beginning. We must continue to work hard, constantly study, and constantly learn from brotherly opera forms, so that Sichuan Opera can bloom more brightly in the socialist era.

　　学习、继承和发展
　　——川剧艺术漫谈
　　席明真
    在“百花齐放、推陈出新”的戏曲工作方针的指导下，川剧艺术在不断提高，不断进步着。
    四川戏和其他许多古老的剧种一样有着深厚的传统基础，不论从剧本文学、戏曲音乐、表演艺术上看，都保存了不少先辈艺术家所创造的精神财富，是祖国艺术的宝藏之一。因此对传统艺术进行发掘、整理，及时地把这些传统艺术继承下来，并从传统的基础上丰富、提炼，求得进一步的发展，是十分重要的工作，作为一个戏曲艺术的学徒，我深深地体会到这个工作的积极意义。
    曾经有一个时期，由于演出团体更多注意了剧场演出，放松了对传统剧目的发掘、整理工作，在演出上剧目显得比较单调。有的同志善意地批评了这个缺点，同时指出，不努力传统剧目的发掘，老说剧目贫乏，等于是“端着金饭碗讨饭”。因此，从1954年开始，在党的领导下，在成渝两市分别成立了专门管理发掘、整理工作的机构：川剧剧目鉴定委员会。在中央文化部和全国文艺界的帮助下，积极地展开工作。几年来，四川戏曲工作者付出了极大的劳动，也作出了一定的成绩；四川省川剧院从1955年成立到1958年，共搜集了传统的大型剧目一千四百多本，去年四川省人民出版社出版了川剧院编辑的“传统剧目汇编”九集，包括了三十六个传统剧目，共约一百八十万字左右。同时编辑了已故川剧作家黄吉安选集一册，收集剧本十七个，约七十万字。这些工作得到了党和文艺界的鼓励，因此今年提出了更豪迈的计划，准备继续编辑传统剧目八百万字，由成、渝两市的川剧工作者共同完成这个任务。
    在发掘、整理工作上所取得的成就，丰富了剧团的上演剧目，鼓舞了川剧工作者的干劲，同时，也给戏剧界提供了不少的优秀剧目，给剧坛添上了一笔绚丽的色彩。
    值得一提的是川剧艺术家们，特别善于运用夸张的喜剧手法来处理严肃的题材，在那些优秀的剧本中，浪漫主义和现实主义的手法能够得到巧妙的结合。因此在描写古代人民的生活、斗争，以及表现古代人民的愿望，都能做到生动而真实。但传统剧本中，由于历史的局限，是瑕瑜互见，精华与糟粕并存的。如何取其精华、弃其糟粕，是个极其复杂、极其细致的工作，我们必须用历史的、唯物的观点来分析，来对待。如果采取简单的方法，往往会适得其反，成了“弃其精华”了。如“焚香记”的整理，在“打神告庙”一场中，被焦桂英打倒的两个排子和皂隶，就曾经被认为是破坏了悲剧的完整性，而让它较长时间从舞台上退休了的。
    本来，这一对泥塑小鬼被打倒后，重新站起来，演员采用了摇晃的傀儡和皮影的手法来表演，正表现了极度痛苦的焦桂英的精神活动，表现了焦桂英的神思恍惚，在时间空间都有限制的舞台上，能够这样精炼地来刻划剧中人物的内心世界是相当出色的手法。而我们却只看到小鬼的唱词有庸俗之处，因而加以否定了。又如，当王魁入赘在韩相府中，拜堂以后，掌着红烛，送新婚夫妇入洞房的丫环，在传统的表演中，是由焦桂英代演的。当王魁看见这个丫环，发觉了她的身材、容貌都和被他抛弃的焦桂英相似，于是，他怀疑了；又是怕、又是胆怯、却又是充满了疑团。他呆呆地望着这个丫环入了神，忘记了举步。而在这个丫环的眼中，却觉得这个新郎倌好生无礼，第一次来到相府，刚才和小姐拜堂行礼，却就是这么不老实。于是，她动了点气，把脚一踢，说：“看什么？我们是侍候人的丫头！”一声沉重的打击乐器的声响，才把王魁惊醒过来。这也是对剧中人内心活动的深刻揭露。这和“梵王宫”中花荣射雕一场，花荣去代角车伕，让那个多情的耶律含嫣把他看成是自己的意中人一样，一个是写少女热情的狂恋，一个是写负心人的犯罪心理，都能各尽其妙，这毫无疑义地是从生活基础出发的艺术夸张，是精华而不是糟粕。又如“打神”一场的曲牌，更是用的激昂凄厉的“端正好”，在打皂隶时，也曾经一度被修改为近于朗诵的“扑灯蛾”。因此在抒泄焦桂英的被侮辱与被损害的愤激之情，是减去了不少动人心魄的激情的，也在一定程度上减低了悲剧的感人力量。
    用喜剧的夸张手法，来表现严肃的悲剧题材，最能够代表的剧本应该是“拉郎配”了。“拉郎配”是揭露封建时代的惨无人道的“选美”制度的。封建统治者，为了一己私欲，不顾人民妻离子散的痛苦，任意在民间挑选年轻女子入宫作奴隶。这原本是令人发指的事。优秀的艺术家用了他生花的妙笔，通过了三户不同地位的人家——地方统治阶级的当权人物县官、豪绅和江湖卖艺的平民的不同遭遇，深刻而生动地揭露了这种制度的残酷和腐朽的本质。
    值得提出的是，对已故川剧作家黄吉安作品的搜集和整理。
    黄吉安是清末民初时代川剧的重要作家，剧作非常丰富，四川省川剧院已搜集了他的剧本七十来种。川剧艺人对黄吉安的剧作非常尊重，称之为“黄本”。黄本的特色是文从字顺，雅俗共赏。特别是对于一些古代叱咤风云的帝王，敢于尽情嘲讽。最近整理上演的“闹齐庭”，就是黄吉安根据“东周列国志”“宴蛾儿逾墙尽节、群公子大闹朝堂”写的。他用他锋利的笔尖，戳破了封建统治者的丑恶的本质。当齐桓公病危，他的几位夫人和几家公子，为了争夺王位，变得兄弟成仇、六亲不认：“龙楼凤阁摆战场，手足相残也平常”，就赤裸裸地揭露了封建阶级的丑恶。他们甚至于对临死的老人，他们的父亲、丈夫，也尽情辱骂，骂他是“老而不死”，骂他“装死卖活”。他们为了一己私利，为了反对王位的世袭，他们也振振有词地说“长子继位在齐国就行不通！”因为齐桓公就曾争夺过公子纠的江山。原来这一些窃据大位的封建霸君，在人民艺术家的眼中，不过是沐猴而冠的、鼻梁上涂抹了白粉的小丑而已。也许黄吉安正因为生在清王朝崩溃、继之以四川军阀长期混战的时代，因此对于这些封建人物有着深深的厌恶吧。像这一类长期为人所忽视的剧目被发掘出来，纠正了一时只重生旦戏的偏向。而且更提高了川剧工作者的思想水平。
    当然，有了好剧本，也必须有优秀的表演艺术才能体现出剧本的精神。旧社会中，反动政府对川剧艺术摧残得非常厉害，老艺人由于生活穷困也大多雕谢了。解放以来，党对这工作提出了“抢救”的口号，号召青年演员继承传统。这样，对许多在旧社会淹埋已久的特技，能够逐渐拭去尘埃，依然像珍珠一样，放出夺目的光彩。如像这一次来北京演出的“水漫金山寺”，其中使用的“托举”的舞蹈，表现了白娘子的热情、优美的情操；在饶钹神出场和与白氏相遇时，使用了几次变脸的特技，使人更深地认识了封建势力的凶残。这些曾经认为是已故川剧名演员康子林的生平绝技的用脚尖踢成“韦陀”的慧眼和变脸的特技，都是青年演员在“解放思想、苦学苦练”下，从前辈身上继承下来的。在这过程中，也改变了旧日脱离人物、脱离剧情的单纯玩弄技巧的表演方法，使这些特技能够更集中、更凸出地表现了人物性格，帮助了戏剧情节的发展，如像“拦马”中，焦光普的椅子工，从前也仅止于个人的卖弄，经过青年演员的刻苦钻研，基本上做到了从人物出发，从剧情出发，表现了焦光普的风趣和对祖国热爱的心情。
    即如“百花赠剑”这出优美如诗的戏，过去也因为某些表演上存在庸俗趣味，曾被长期地冷淡。
    经过党委的督促，这些绝技被扫除了在旧社会中所蒙蔽的尘埃，解下了神秘的面纱，重新在舞台上获得了青春。
    川剧事业的发展，更可喜的是表现在大量的青年演员的成长上。艺术生命的延续，并不在于演员自己的长寿，而是在于继承有人。党委对这个工作是非常重视的，这次来京演出的川剧团，就是集中了成渝两市和几个专区的部分优秀的新生力量。这一些青年经过“上山下乡”、经过“为钢而战”的运动，懂得了艺术与劳动、艺术与政治的密切关系，他们像在春风春雨下润育着的花朵一样，生气勃勃，绚烂夺目地开放着。
    党委对培养青年演员的工作，除开成立了四川省川剧实验学校以外，在成、渝两市还定期举办了演员讲习会，轮流训练演员。大跃进以来，好几个专区都举办了短期的训练川剧演员的机构。人民公社成立后，业余的川剧组织，在专业剧团的辅导下，差不多能够结合生产，及时地把劳动中产生的新人新事，编成川剧及时地演出，体现了文艺为政治服务、为生产服务的方针。专业剧团更积极地为表现现代题材而努力，如去年在成都演出的“丁佑君”、重庆演出的“一人商店红旗飘”都得到观众的好评。
    应该说，我们的学习、继承和发展的工作，还只是一个开端，我们还要不断努力，不断钻研，不断向兄弟剧种学习，使川剧在社会主义的时代开出更鲜艳的花朵。
