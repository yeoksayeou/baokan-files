Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 7th - After the armed rebellion of the Tibetan upper-strata reactionary clique on March 10th, Gyatsoling Living Buddha, who delivered the first letter from Central Government Representative in Tibet Acting Representative General Tan Guansan to the Dalai Lama, recounted his experience delivering the letter to the reporter. Gyatsoling Living Buddha is the Vice President of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China and the tutor of the Dalai Lama. After he took General Tan Guansan's letter into the Norbulingka on March 10th, he was trapped inside until the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the rebellious forces in the Norbulingka, after which he was freed.

Gyatsoling Living Buddha said that on the afternoon of March 10th, Li Zuomin, the director of the United Front Work Department of the CCP Tibet Work Committee, gave him a letter from General Tan Guansan, the Central Government Representative in Tibet Acting Representative, to the Dalai Lama at the United Front Work Department, and drove him home. He then rode a horse from his home to the Norbulingka. As he traveled towards the Norbulingka, the area from west of the Potala Palace to the Norbulingka was filled with armed rebels who had surrounded the Norbulingka layer upon layer. Gyatsoling Living Buddha said that the gates of the Norbulingka were tightly closed, guarded by the first generation of Tibetan troops. He waited outside the gate for an hour and a half, from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM, before being allowed inside. He said that inside the Norbulingka, there were also many rebels.

Gyatsoling Living Buddha said that he handed General Tan Guansan's letter to the Dalai Lama in a palace called Datang Pozhang. He said: "I met the Dalai Lama in a room to the left of this palace. The Dalai Lama was very worried, sitting in a chair with his hands on his forehead. I reported to the Dalai Lama about the situation at the military region, saying that Political Commissar Tan had brought a letter. After the Dalai Lama read the letter, he said to me with great concern: 'They (referring to the rebels) say it is for my safety, but in reality, they are harming me.' The Dalai Lama asked me: 'It is said that Phagpalha Khamchung (i.e., Khamchung Sonam Gyatso) was killed. Do you know the reason?' He also asked me if I had the courage to go to the military region again and asked me to tell the military region about his situation and what I saw inside and outside the Norbulingka."

Gyatsoling Living Buddha said that he originally planned to leave the Norbulingka at 6:00 PM that day, and the Dalai Lama also wanted him to talk to the military region about some things. However, after he left the Dalai Lama, the rebels would not allow him to leave the Norbulingka again. The rebels were standing guard everywhere, so he had to send an 18-year-old boy named Danba, who was by his side, to deliver the opera tickets given to him by the military region to the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, explaining that he could not leave the Norbulingka. He said that because the boy hid the opera tickets in his hat, he was not discovered even though the rebels checked him thoroughly before he left.

Gyatsoling Living Buddha said: "The next day (March 11th), I got up very early, preparing to go out for kora, but the armed rebels would not let me go out for kora. I asked to go to the Dalai Lama's place, but they didn't allow it. I said I wanted to visit relatives and friends, but that was also not allowed." He said that it was not until March 12th that he saw the Dalai Lama again. Gyatsoling Living Buddha said: "I saw the Dalai Lama sitting on a very high throne, his head lowered, one hand on his forehead, still very worried, his face had turned black. There were more than twenty people around the Dalai Lama at the time, including Phala Thubten Wodhen, Ronglangse Thubten Norbu Sang, and Thubten Danda (all traitors). Seeing the Dalai Lama so worried and in such poor health, some people worried that he might die. At that time, someone proposed to negotiate with the rebels, no matter what, they must allow the Dalai Lama to live and listen to the Dalai Lama's words. A lama named Yexi Dunzhu immediately said: 'It is right to let the Dalai Lama live, but listening to his words is not necessarily right.' Another lama with a pistol and wearing a yellow kasaya said: 'This time we have to use our blood and flesh.' Many other people also chimed in. The Dalai Lama waved his hand worriedly and said, 'Forget it, forget it,' and everyone stopped arguing."

Gyatsoling Living Buddha said that after that, he was never able to talk to the Dalai Lama again, nor did he see him again. He said that after March 10th, the Dalai Lama could not move around freely in the Norbulingka either. Armed rebels were also stationed around the palace where the Dalai Lama lived (i.e., Datang Pozhang). Inside the yellow walls were the first generation of Tibetan troops, and outside the yellow walls were Khampa people and other rebels, as well as nobles. He said: Even the door of the Dalai Lama's palace was closed. When he went to see the Dalai Lama, Gungthanglin Zhasa (commander-in-chief of the rebel army) stopped him and interrogated him.

Gyatsoling Living Buddha said that in the days he was in the Norbulingka, people constantly threatened him. He said: "On the fourth day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar (March 13th), the first generation of Tibetan troops sent a Tibetan soldier to tell me not to run around. On the seventh day of the first month (March 16th), another person came to call me. I thought it was the Dalai Lama calling me, so I quickly put on my clothes, but when I was about to leave, I learned that it was Gungthanglin Zhasa, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army, who was calling me. After I went, I saw that there were several other people there, including Xue Kuba and Xagabba (both traitors). Gungthanglin said to me: 'You have a very good relationship with the Han people and also work in the Buddhist Association (Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China). Everyone is very suspicious of you. From today onwards, you must break off relations.'" Gyatsoling Living Buddha said that on the tenth day of the Tibetan calendar (March 19th), two days after the Dalai Lama had been abducted, three rebels came to his residence and said: The Dalai Lama has already left, and you must leave too, you have to leave. He said that he used the excuse that the Dalai Lama wanted him to stay, and the rebels did not urge him anymore.

Gyatsoling Living Buddha finally said that he felt very distressed that the Dalai Lama was abducted by the rebels, and he was very grateful for the Central Government's concern for the Dalai Lama and its attitude towards the Dalai Lama. He said: I wholeheartedly support Panchen Erdeni acting as the Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region during the Dalai Lama's abduction, resolutely support the State Council's orders, believe in the Central Government's policies, and will definitely act in accordance with the Central Government's instructions in the future.

    谭冠三将军的第一封信怎样送给了达赖喇嘛
    嘉措林活佛谈述送信的经历
    新华社拉萨7日电　3月10日西藏上层反动集团武装叛乱后，将中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三将军给达赖喇嘛的第一封信送给达赖喇嘛的嘉措林活佛，向记者叙述了他去罗布林卡送信的经历。嘉措林活佛是中国佛教协会西藏分会副会长、达赖喇嘛的侍读。他在3月10日将谭冠三将军的信带进罗布林卡后，就被困在罗布林卡，直到罗布林卡的叛乱武装被人民解放军全部歼灭以后，他才获得自由。
    嘉措林活佛说，3月10日下午，中共西藏工委统战部处长李佐民在统战部交给他一封中央驻西藏代理代表谭冠三将军给达赖喇嘛的信，用汽车送他回家，他随即从家里骑马去罗布林卡。当他前往罗布林卡时，从布达拉宫以西到罗布林卡沿途一带，到处是武装的叛匪，将罗布林卡层层围住。嘉措林活佛说，罗布林卡的大门紧紧关着，有藏军第一代本在守卫，他从下午三时半到五时，在大门外等了一个半小时才被允许入内。他说，在罗布林卡里面，也有很多的叛匪。
    嘉措林活佛说，他是在一座叫做达旦颇章的宫殿里将谭冠三将军的信交给达赖喇嘛的。他说：“我在这座宫殿左边的一间屋子里碰见了达赖喇嘛，达赖喇嘛非常忧愁，坐在椅子上，双手扶着额头。我向达赖喇嘛报告了去军区的情况，说谭政委带来了一封信。达赖喇嘛看过信后，很忧虑地对我说：‘他们（指叛乱分子）说为了我的安全，实际上是在危害我。’达赖喇嘛问我：据说帕巴拉堪穷（即堪穷索朗降措）被打死了，你知不知道是什么原因？他还问我有没有胆量再到军区去，要我把他的处境和我看到的罗布林卡里外的情况，都向军区谈一下。”
    嘉措林活佛说，他本来准备当天下午六时就离开罗布林卡的，达赖喇嘛也要他向军区谈些情况，可是他离开达赖喇嘛以后，叛匪已不让他再出罗布林卡。叛匪到处都站着岗，他只好派了他身边一个名叫丹巴的十八岁的孩子将军区送给他的戏票送到自治区筹委会去，说明他已不能离开罗布林卡。他说，由于孩子把戏票藏在帽子里，出门时虽然周身都被叛匪检查了，仍未被发觉。
    嘉措林活佛说：“次日（3月11日）我很早就起来，准备出去转经，但武装的叛匪不让我出去转经，我提出要到达赖喇嘛那里去一下，也不允许，说想到亲戚朋友家去看看，还是不行。”他说，到3月12日，他才又看到达赖喇嘛一次。嘉措林活佛说：“我看见达赖喇嘛坐在一个很高的宝座上，头低着，一只手扶着额头，仍然非常忧愁，脸都变黑了。在达赖喇嘛的周围，当时有二十多人，其中有帕拉·土登为登、绒朗色·土登诺桑、土丹旦达（都是叛国分子）等。看到达赖喇嘛那样忧虑，身体很坏，有些人担心他可能死去。当时有人提出与叛乱分子商量，无论如何要使达赖喇嘛能活下去，要听达赖喇嘛的话。有个叫益西顿珠的喇嘛立即说：要达赖喇嘛活下去是对的，但听他的话就不一定对。还有个身上带着一支手枪、穿件黄袈裟的喇嘛说：这次我们要把身上的血和肉使用一下。其他很多人也随声吵起来。达赖喇嘛忧虑地摆摆手，说‘算了，算了’，大家才没再吵。”
    嘉措林活佛说，从这以后，他再也没有能和达赖喇嘛谈一次话，也没见一次面。他说，达赖喇嘛在3月10日以后，在罗布林卡也不能随意走动。达赖喇嘛居住的宫殿（即达旦颇章）周围，也有武装的叛匪站岗，在黄墙里面是藏军第一代本，黄墙外面是康巴人和其他叛匪，还有贵族。他说：连达赖喇嘛宫殿的门也是关住的，他去见达赖喇嘛的时候，功德林扎萨（叛军总司令）曾拦住他进行了盘问。
    嘉措林活佛说，他在罗布林卡的几天，不断有人对他进行威胁。他说：“藏历二月初四（3月13日）第一代本派了个藏军来叫我不要乱跑。藏历初七（3月16日），又有一个人来叫我，我以为是达赖喇嘛叫，迅速把衣服穿起来，将走时才知道是叛军总司令功德林扎萨叫的。我去后，看到还有雪苦巴、夏格巴（都是叛国分子）等好几人在那里，功德林对我说：“你和汉人关系很好，又在佛协（中国佛教协会西藏分会）干事，大家对你非常怀疑，你从今天起一定要断绝关系。”嘉措林活佛说，在藏历十日（3月19日），达赖喇嘛已被劫走两天以后，还有三个叛匪到他住处说：达赖喇嘛已经走了，你也必须走，不走不行。他说，他借口是达赖喇嘛要他留下来的，叛匪才没再来催促他。
    嘉措林活佛最后说，他对达赖喇嘛被叛乱分子劫走感到很痛心，他对中央对达赖喇嘛的关怀和对达赖喇嘛的态度，非常感激。他说：我衷心拥护在达赖喇嘛被劫持期间由班禅额尔德尼代理西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员职务，坚决拥护国务院的命令，相信中央的政策，今后一定按照中央的指示去做。
