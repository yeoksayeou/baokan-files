Still Need to Emphasize Potato Production
By People's Daily Commentator

In recent years, especially last year, thanks to the vigorous advocacy of Party committees at all levels and the efforts of the broad masses of farmers, China's potato crops, like other crops, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. This has played a significant role in improving the national food situation and people's lives, as well as revitalizing the entire national economy.

This year, we still need to attach importance to the development of potato production.

In the situation where grain production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, and this year will continue to make a great leap forward, why is it still necessary to emphasize the importance of potato production?

The promotion or non-promotion of a certain crop is generally based on the size of the crop's yield and the amount of its uses. Crops with large yields and many uses should be promoted and developed. Potatoes happen to possess both of these advantages simultaneously. It has a large yield and is a well-known high-yield crop, with one mu capable of producing thousands or even tens of thousands of catties. It has a wide range of uses, containing rich sugar and starch, and is a very good food source that is indispensable for improving and adjusting our lives; it is also a very good feed for developing animal husbandry. The great development of agriculture requires a large amount of fertilizer and draught animals; the increasing improvement of people's lives requires a large amount of meat, eggs, and dairy products. With sufficient feed, our animal husbandry can be greatly developed. Potatoes are also an important raw material for the food industry and the chemical industry, it can be used to make starch, boil sugar, and also brew wine. With the development of China's daily chemical industry, it can also manufacture artificial rubber, plastics, and other industrial products with extremely wide uses. It is precisely for this reason that we not only attached importance to potato production in the past when food was relatively scarce, but we still need to attach importance to the development of potato production in the future after grain has greatly increased. Of course, potato products also have shortcomings, such as their large volume, high water content, difficulty in storage, and easy spoilage, which can cause waste. However, these shortcomings only arise and exist under certain conditions, such as excessively concentrated planting, which leads to failure to harvest and process in time, etc. This is a matter of work arrangement, and as long as we arrange it properly, the conditions will change.

Potatoes should be viewed comprehensively. If one only sees the shortcomings of potatoes and develops negative emotions about the development of potato production, it will be unfavorable whether from the need to develop agricultural production itself, or from improving people's lives and developing the daily chemical industry. Of course, areas where potato crops were planted too much last year should appropriately reduce some, but not too much; areas where fewer potatoes were planted last year should appropriately plant more this year. From a national perspective, the total planting area of potatoes should not be lower than last year, but should be distributed more evenly and planted in a more planned manner. This requires agricultural leadership departments at all levels to make comprehensive arrangements as early as possible according to the national plan, and to implement the plan down to the communes and production teams.

Time is already very pressing, and the season for potato seedling cultivation and transplanting has arrived in most parts of the country. All localities must quickly conduct a thorough inspection of potato planting work, mobilize the masses to replant in areas where the planting area has been reduced too much, and make every effort to strengthen seedling field management in areas with earlier seasons. In addition, according to the characteristics of potato production that it can grow everywhere regardless of land, mobilizing the masses to use barren slopes, open spaces, and small scattered plots of land in front of and behind houses to increase the planting of some potatoes is also a practice worth promoting.

    仍要重视薯类生产
    本报评论员
    几年来，特别是去年，经过各级党委的大力倡导和广大农民的努力，我国薯类作物像其他作物一样，获得了空前的大丰收。这对于改善全国粮食状况和人民生活，以及活跃整个国民经济，都起了巨大作用。
    今年，我们仍然需要重视发展薯类生产。
    在去年粮食获得空前大丰收，今年仍将继续大跃进的形势下，为什么仍要强调重视薯类生产呢？
    提倡发展某种作物或者不发展某种作物，一般都是以作物产量大小和用途多少为标准的。产量大用途多的，就要提倡，就要发展。薯类恰恰同时具备着这两个优点。它产量大，是有名的高产作物，一亩薯都能产几千斤甚至上万斤。它用途很广，含有丰富的糖分和淀粉，是我们改善生活、调剂生活不可缺少的一种很好的食粮；也是发展牧畜业一种很好的饲料。农业大发展需要大量的肥料和耕畜；人民生活的日益提高，需要大量的肉食、蛋品和乳品。有了充足的饲料，我们的牧畜业就可以大大地发展起来了。薯类更是食品工业、化学工业的重要原料，它可以制淀粉，可以熬糖，也可以酿酒，随着我国日用化学工业的发展，它还可以制造人造橡胶、塑料等等用途极广的工业品。正是因为这种原故，我们不仅在过去粮食比较缺乏的时候重视薯类生产，在今后粮食有了极大的增长以后，仍然需要重视发展薯类生产。当然薯类产品也有缺点，比如它体积大、水分多，不易保管、容易腐坏造成浪费等。但这些缺点只是在一定的条件下才产生和存在，比如过分地集中种植，以致不能及时收获、及时加工等等。这是工作安排问题，只要我们安排适当，条件就会变化。
    应当全面地看待薯类。如果，只看到薯类的缺点，对于发展薯类生产发生消极情绪，那无论从发展农业生产本身的需要看，还是从改善人民生活和发展日用化学工业看，都是不利的。当然，去年薯类作物种植过多的地区，应该适当地缩减一些，但也不能减少太多；去年种薯少的地区，今年应当适当地多种一些。从全国范围说，薯类的种植总面积，不应该低于去年，只是要分布的更均匀些、种植的更有计划一些。这就要求各级农业领导部门根据国家计划，及早作出全面安排，并把计划落实到公社和生产队。
    时间已经很紧迫了，全国大部地区已经到了薯类育秧、栽秧的季节。各地要赶快对薯类的种植工作做一次深入的检查，对于缩减种植面积过多的地区要发动群众补种，季节较早的地区要千方百计地加强苗田管理。此外，根据薯类生产不择土地到处都能生长的特点，发动群众利用荒坡、空地和房前屋后的小块零星土地增种一些薯类，也是一个值得提倡的作法。
