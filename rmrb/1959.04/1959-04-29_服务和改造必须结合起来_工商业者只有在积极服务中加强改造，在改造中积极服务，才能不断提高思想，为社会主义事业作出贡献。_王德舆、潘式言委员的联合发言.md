    Service and Transformation Must Be Combined
    Industrialists and businesspeople can only continuously improve their thinking and contribute to the cause of socialism by strengthening transformation through active service and actively serving through transformation.
    Joint Speech by Members Wang Deyu and Pan Shiyan
Esteemed Members:
    We wholeheartedly support the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference delivered by Vice Chairman Li Weihan, the Government Work Report delivered by Premier Zhou Enlai at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." We are thrilled by the great achievements of the motherland in 1958 and are filled with boundless confidence and determination to strive for a greater leap forward in 1959. From the reports, we have received another profound communist education, and we are even more aware that only under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we have today's Great Leap Forward and a bright future. The prosperous and brilliant socialist and communist society is no longer a distant ideal but an expected reality.
    We would like to talk about some of our understandings regarding service and transformation of industrialists and businesspeople. We hope that the members will offer criticism and corrections for anything that is incorrect.
    After the Joint Expanded Meeting of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Trade and Industry (Executive Committee) proposed "Strengthening Transformation, Actively Serving," and through communication, discussion, and study, the vast majority of industrialists and businesspeople have improved their ideological understanding and have also shown it in action. However, from what we have learned, problems still exist. The main issue is that many people have different views on the combination of service and transformation, believing that transformation and service are contradictory. Some say: only talk about transformation, don't talk about service, separating politics from business and turning "strengthening transformation" into empty words. Others say: only talk about service, talk less about transformation, and don't put politics in command, causing "active service" to lose its direction. These erroneous ideas hinder the progress of industrialists and businesspeople, preventing them from making their due contributions to the cause of socialist construction.
    In the several years since liberation, especially after the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the ideological awareness of industrialists and businesspeople has greatly improved, and they have played a certain beneficial role in the cause of socialist construction. However, it cannot be denied that most people have not yet abandoned their bourgeois standpoints, views, and methods, and capitalist elements are still reflected in various aspects. In terms of accepting the leadership of the Party, some people are still half-hearted, harboring doubts, holding reservations, and not daring to be open and honest. They have not ideologically accepted the leadership of the Party, have not followed, or have not fully followed, the path pointed out by the Party. Even when they have taken the wrong path, they not only do not accept the lessons but also complain that the Party does not trust them. In terms of enterprise management, many people have not fully recognized the decadence of capitalism and the superiority of socialism, and still retain capitalist management ideas and styles. When their capitalist management ideas are criticized by the workers, they not only do not strive to correct them but also complain that wearing the hat of the bourgeoisie hinders them from bringing their enthusiasm into play. In terms of collective leadership, they are accustomed to making arbitrary decisions, believing that collective leadership is "superfluous," and even believing that collective leadership is not as efficient as arbitrary decision-making. In terms of relying on the worker masses, some people either emphasize objective difficulties and stop moving forward, or they go into battle alone. When they encounter difficulties, they become discouraged and do not actively rely on the worker masses, believing that they have their own way of doing things and that the workers are not as smart as they are, and they are not convinced to learn from the worker masses. Some still have a bourgeois demeanor, thinking, "I am the manager or factory director, how can I discuss issues with the workers?" and placing themselves above the worker masses. When the worker masses offer them opinions, they do not humbly listen to these opinions, examine their own shortcomings, and strive to correct them. On the contrary, they still have resistance, thinking that criticism is an attack on them and that it makes them lose "face." In terms of participating in labor, some are only working for the sake of working, without truly understanding the greatness of labor and experiencing the thoughts and feelings of the working people. Some are "physically present in labor but mentally resentful," and so on. The above situation shows that before the bourgeois elements have undergone fundamental transformation in their political stance and ideology, some mistakes and incorrect ideas and practices will inevitably arise in serving socialism. Only by constantly transforming our thinking in practice, accepting the education of facts, and combining service and transformation, strengthening transformation through active service, and actively serving under the strengthening of transformation, can we continuously improve our thinking and contribute to the cause of socialism. Conversely, if we only talk about strengthening transformation and not actively serving, and abstractly isolate transformation, we will not achieve the desired results, and bourgeois ideology will still stir up trouble in specific practice. For example, some people are very "active" in signing up to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, but after approval, they wail and cry instead. If we only talk about actively serving and not strengthening transformation, so that service is divorced from politics, it is also impossible to serve well. For example, one private individual in a factory also worked actively, but he resisted the enterprise's Great Leap Forward plan and acted according to the "old almanac," and as a result, the production plan was not completed. These are all common occurrences. Therefore, service must be combined with transformation, and any view or practice that separates service from transformation is wrong.
    Our country is leaping forward at a rapid pace. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line for building socialism, the people of the whole country are working selflessly, taking active actions to complete and overfulfill the 1959 plan to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland. We industrialists and businesspeople should actively join the people of the whole country and devote ourselves to the great cause of socialist construction, and we should recognize that being able to participate in the heroic cause of socialist construction in our motherland and contribute our strength to this cause is an honor given to us by the Party. At the same time, for ourselves, only by serving socialism can we achieve a truly thorough transformation.

    服务和改造必须结合起来
    工商业者只有在积极服务中加强改造，在改造中积极服务，才能不断提高思想，为社会主义事业作出贡献。
    王德舆、潘式言委员的联合发言各位委员：
    我们衷心拥护李维汉副主席所作的关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，和周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上作的政府工作报告、李富春副总理所作的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理所作的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”、彭真副委员长所作“全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告”。我们为一九五八年祖国伟大的成就欢欣鼓舞，充满无限的信心和决心为实现一九五九年更大跃进而奋斗。从报告中我们受到了又一次深刻的共产主义教育，更加认识到只有在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，才有今天的大跃进，才有美好的将来，繁荣昌盛光明灿烂的社会主义和共产主义社会，已经不是遥远的理想，而是可以预期的现实。
    我们想在这里谈一下关于工商业者服务和改造方面的一些认识，不对的地方，希望各位委员批评指正。
    民建中央、全国工商联中（执）委联席扩大会议提出了“加强改造，积极服务”以后，通过传达和讨论学习，广大工商业者在思想认识上有所提高，在行动上也有所表现，但是从我们了解的情况看来，不是已经没有了问题，存在问题还是不少的。主要表现在对服务和改造相结合的认识，不少人存在有不同看法，认为改造与服务有矛盾，有的说：只要谈改造，不要谈服务。把政治与业务割裂开来，把“加强改造”停留在口头上，成为一句空话；有的则说：只要服务，少谈一点改造。不要政治挂帅，使“积极服务”失去了方向。这些错误思想，阻碍了工商业者的进步，使他们在建设社会主义事业中不能作出应有的贡献。
    解放几年来，特别是在整风和反右派斗争以后，工商业者思想觉悟有很大提高，在建设社会主义事业中起了一定的有益的作用。但是也不能否认大多数人还没有抛弃资产阶级立场、观点、方法，资本主义的东西还从各个方面反映出来。在接受党的领导方面，有些人还三心二意，怀有疑虑，存有戒备，不敢推心置腹，畅所欲言，没有从思想上接受党的领导，没有按照或者没有完全按照党所指引的道路去走，甚至当自己走错了路的时候，不但不接受教训，还抱怨党不相信自己，在企业经营管理上，不少人还没有完全认识到资本主义腐朽，社会主义优越，还保存着资本主义经营思想和作风，当自己这些资本主义经营思想受到职工群众批评的时候，不但不努力改正，反而抱怨戴上这顶资产阶级帽子，妨碍了自己发挥积极性。在集体领导上，习惯于独断专行，认为集体领导是“多此一举”，甚至认为集体领导还没有独断专行工作效率高。在依靠工人群众上，有些人不是强调客观困难停步不前就是单枪匹马上阵，遇到困难就心灰意冷，不积极去依靠工人群众，认为自己有一套，工人还不如我聪明，对向工人群众学习不服气。有的还有资产阶级架子，认为我是经理、厂长，怎么好和工人去商量问题呢？把自己放在工人群众之上。当工人群众对他们提出意见时，他们也不去虚心听取这些意见，检查自己的缺点，努力改正，相反地还存在着抵触情绪，认为批评他是打击他，丢了他的“面子”。在参加劳动上，有的只是为劳动而劳动，没有很好地在劳动中去认识劳动的伟大，去体验劳动人民思想感情，有些人是“身在劳动心在怨”等等。上述情况说明资产阶级分子在政治立场和思想没有得到根本改造以前，在为社会主义服务中必然会出现一些错误和不正确的想法和做法，只有在实践中不断地改造思想，接受事实的教育，把服务与改造结合起来，在积极服务中加强改造，在加强改造下积极服务，才能不断地提高自己思想，为社会主义事业作出贡献。相反地，如果只讲加强改造，不积极服务，把改造抽象地孤立起来，就不能取得应有的效果，在具体实践中资产阶级思想还会起来兴风作浪。比如有的人报名上山下乡非常“积极”，批准后，他却反而痛哭流涕。如果只讲积极服务，不加强改造，使服务脱离政治，同样也不可能服务好，比如有一个工厂一私方人员，也积极工作，但就是对企业大跃进计划有抵触，按“老皇历”办事，结果生产计划就没有完成。这些都是屡见不鲜的事实。因此，服务必须与改造结合起来，任何把服务与改造分裂开来的看法和做法都是错误的。
    我们的国家正在一日千里地向前跃进，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民正在忘我地劳动着，以完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，来迎接我们伟大的祖国国庆十周年。我们工商业者应该积极和全国人民一道，投身到伟大的社会主义建设事业中去，并且应该认识自己能够参加祖国社会主义豪迈的事业，在这个事业中贡献出自己的力量，这是党给予我们的光荣。同时，对自己个人来说，也只有在为社会主义服务中，才能够使自己得到真正的彻底的改造。
