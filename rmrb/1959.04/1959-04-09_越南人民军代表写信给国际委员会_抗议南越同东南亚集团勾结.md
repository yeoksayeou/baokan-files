Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 8th: Newspapers here reported today that Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission, on April 4th, protesting against the South Vietnamese authorities' increasingly intensified collusion with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in violation of the Geneva Accords.

The letter pointed out that from 1955 to the present, the South Vietnamese authorities have sent representatives to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's meetings six times and have sent people to participate in the group's military exercises six times, including the combat exercises with atomic weapons held in Thailand in March this year. The letter also stated that not only that, but in recent years, the military forces of the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, including the navy of the US Seventh Fleet and the air force with jet aircraft, have also continuously entered South Vietnam. From 1956 to the end of 1958 alone, the navies and air forces of many countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization had entered South Vietnam eighteen times. From the beginning of 1956 to the end of 1958, according to incomplete materials, nearly sixty delegations led by important military personnel from member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, especially the United States, entered South Vietnam. In addition, in recent years, the head of this aggressive group, the United States, also has two thousand advisors and military personnel, including the U.S. permanent air force unit, stationed in South Vietnam.

The letter said: According to the above facts, it cannot be denied that the relationship between South Vietnam and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, especially with the United States, is unusually close, and at the same time, it shows that a military alliance between South Vietnam and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization headed by the United States is forming.

The letter also listed the talks made by US Secretary of State Dulles and others attempting to drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the intention of the South Vietnamese authorities to express "hope to join" this group.

The letter emphasized that the US imperialists' conspiracy to drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive group and the actions of the southern authorities in close collusion with this group must not be allowed to continue. The letter requested the International Commission to study the above issues as soon as possible, urge the South Vietnamese authorities to stop all illegal relations with the Southeast Asia aggressive group, and draw conclusions on the events reported by the Liaison Delegation to the International Commission regarding the Southern regime's violation of Article 19 of the Geneva Agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam.

    越南人民军代表写信给国际委员会
    抗议南越同东南亚集团勾结
    新华社河内8日电　这里报纸今天报道，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校4日写信给国际委员会主席安萨里，抗议南越当局违反日内瓦协议日益加紧同东南亚条约组织勾结。
    信中指出，从1955年到现在，南越当局曾经六次派遣代表出席东南亚条约组织的会议，并且六次派人参加这个集团的军事演习，其中包括今年3月间在泰国举行的有原子武器的战斗演习。信中还说，不仅这样，几年来东南亚条约组织成员国的军事力量，包括有美国第七舰队的海军和有喷气式飞机的空军等也连续进入南越。仅在1956年到1958年底，东南亚条约组织许多国家的海军和空军就曾经十八次进入南越。从1956年初至1958年底，据不完全的材料，由东南亚条约组织成员国，尤其是美国的重要军事人员率领的近六十个代表团进入了南越。此外，几年来，这个侵略集团的首脑美国也有二千名顾问和军事人员，包括美国常设的空军单位在内，驻在南越。
    信中说：根据上述的事实，不能否认，越南南方和东南亚条约组织，尤其是同美国之间的关系是异常密切的，同时也表明了越南南方同以美国为首的东南亚条约组织之间的军事联盟正在形成。
    信中还列举了美国国务卿杜勒斯等人发表的、企图把南越拉入东南亚条约组织的谈话，和南越当局表示过“希望参加”这个集团的意图。
    信中强调说，绝不能让美帝国主义企图把越南南方拉入东南亚侵略集团的阴谋和南方当局同这个集团紧密勾结的行动继续下去。信中要求国际委员会尽早研究上述问题，促使南越当局停止同东南亚侵略集团的一切非法关系，并对联络代表团向国际委员会所有报告中关于南方政权违反日内瓦协议关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定第十九条的事件作出结论。
