    Avalanche in Mussoorie
    Ji Bu
    An avalanche has occurred in Mussoorie, on the southern slopes of the Himalayas. This is a political avalanche, and the Dalai Lama, who is now living there, has confirmed to Nehru that he had written several letters to General Tan Guansan, the acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet. This has caused the main pretext for India's various accusations against China since the Tibetan rebellion to collapse like an avalanche.
    People remember that before this, some Indian politicians and newspapers had vehemently asserted that the Dalai Lama's departure from Lhasa was proof of Chinese "tyranny." They had also presented the two so-called "Dalai Lama's statements" as expressions of the Dalai Lama's "free will." It was under these pretexts that they launched a slander campaign against New China and defended their crude interference in China's internal affairs. The premise of all these pretexts was that the Dalai Lama's departure from Lhasa was voluntary and not by abduction. For this reason, they have stubbornly denied the fact that the Dalai Lama was abducted.
    However, people know that the most powerful proof that the Dalai Lama was abducted is the three letters from the Dalai Lama to the acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet, which were published by Xinhua News Agency more than twenty days ago. In the letter of March 11, the day after the rebellion broke out, the Dalai Lama told General Tan Guansan, "Reactionary bad elements are using the pretext of protecting my safety to carry out activities that endanger me." The letter of March 12 stated, "Yesterday I notified the Kashag, ordering the illegal People's Conference to be dissolved immediately, and the reactionary elements who presumptuously entered the Norbulingka Palace in the name of protecting me must be withdrawn immediately." On March 16, the day before the Dalai Lama was abducted from Lhasa, he said in a letter to General Tan Guansan, "Although the internal and external situation here is still difficult to deal with, I am using clever methods to internally divide the government officials into two types of people: those who are progressive and those who oppose the revolution. Once I have a certain amount of reliable strength in a few days, I will take a secret approach to the military region."
    It is not difficult for people to see from this that the Dalai Lama was surrounded and abducted by the rebels at that time, and he lost his freedom of action. A servant in the Dalai Lama's house who is still in Lhasa also heard the Dalai Lama's mother say at the time, "The Dalai Lama has no power and freedom now. It's terrible. What should we do?" On the day before he was abducted, the Dalai Lama also wanted to take a secret approach (open action was impossible under the siege of the rebels) to the Tibet Military Region Command instead of going to the Shannan area and India. These three letters not only have the Dalai Lama's original handwritten letters as evidence, but also have Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, who forwarded these letters at the time, as a witness.
    However, some Indian politicians and newspaper commentators are closing their eyes and talking nonsense, insisting that "the Dalai Lama was abducted" is a fabrication and a lie. They even attacked Premier Zhou Enlai, saying that his statement about the Dalai Lama being abducted was a "Himalayan lie" and a "clumsy insistence on a shameless lie."
    Now, the truth has come out! The Dalai Lama has confirmed to Nehru that he wrote these letters. This also confirms that the Dalai Lama was abducted. Since the Dalai Lama was abducted, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group launched a rebellion, which not only violated the will of the Tibetan people, but also violated the will of the Dalai Lama. Their so-called "national independence," "complete autonomy," "religious freedom," etc., are just deceptive tricks. At the same time, since the Dalai Lama was abducted, how could he freely express his opinions? What are the two so-called "Dalai Lama's statements" if not imposed on him by others? What are they if not fig leaves for Indian expansionist elements?
    All the pretexts of the Indian expansionists have completely gone bankrupt! Their true colors are exposed! The so-called "Himalayan lie" and "clumsy insistence on a shameless lie" are most appropriate to return to the Indian expansionists. Their ugly deeds of using the Dalai Lama's name to stir up trouble and interfere in China's internal affairs can stop!

    穆索里的雪崩
    季步
    喜马拉雅山南麓的穆索里发生了一场雪崩，这是一场政治性的雪崩，现在住在那里的达赖喇嘛向尼赫鲁证实他曾经写了几封信给中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三将军，这就使得自从西藏叛乱发生以来印度方面对中国种种指责的主要借口，像雪崩一样垮下来了。
    人们记得，在这以前，印度的某些政治家和报刊曾经振振有词地把达赖喇嘛的离开拉萨作为中国的“暴政”的证明。他们也曾经把两次的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”作为达赖喇嘛“自由意志”的表现。他们就是在这些借口下发动了对新中国的诽谤运动，并且为他们对中国内政的粗暴干涉作辩护。所有这一切借口的前提是：达赖喇嘛的离开拉萨是自愿的而不是被劫持的。正因为这个缘故，他们一直死死否认达赖喇嘛被劫持这个事实。
    但是，人们知道，最有力地证明达赖喇嘛被劫持的，是新华社在二十多天以前公布的达赖喇嘛给中央驻藏代理代表的三封信。达赖喇嘛在叛乱发生后的第二天3月11日给谭冠三将军的信说“反动的坏分子们正在借口保护我的安全而进行着危害我的活动。”3月12日的信又说“昨天我通知噶厦，责令非法的人民会议必须立即解散，以保卫我为名而狂妄地进驻罗布林卡的反动分子必须立即撤走。”就在达赖喇嘛被从拉萨劫走的前一天，3月16日，他在给谭冠三将军的信中还说“现在此间内外的情况虽然仍很难处置，但我正在用巧妙的办法，在政府官员中从内部划分进步与反对革命的两种人的界线。一旦几天之后，有了一定数量的足以信赖的力量之后，将采取秘密的方式前往军区。”
    人们从这里不难看出，达赖喇嘛当时是处在叛乱分子的包围和劫持之下，失去了行动的自由。现在还留在拉萨的达赖喇嘛家中的一位佣人当时也听到达赖喇嘛的母亲说，“达赖现在没有权力和自由了，真糟糕，怎么办？”在被劫走的前一天，达赖喇嘛还想采取秘密的方式（在叛乱分子的包围下，公开行动是不可能了），前往西藏军区司令部，而不是前往山南地区和印度。这三封信不但有达赖喇嘛的亲笔原信作物证，而且还有当时转送这些信的阿沛·阿旺晋美作人证。
    但是，印度的某些政治家和报刊评论的作者们却闭着眼睛说瞎话，硬说“达赖喇嘛被劫持”是捏造、说谎。他们甚至攻击周恩来总理，说他关于达赖喇嘛被劫持的说法是“喜马拉雅山似的谎言”，是“笨拙地坚持一个无耻的谎言”。
    现在，真相已经大白！达赖喇嘛向尼赫鲁证实了他写了这些信。这也就证实了达赖喇嘛是被劫持的。既然达赖喇嘛是被劫持的，那末，西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱，不但违背了西藏人民的意志，而且也违背了达赖喇嘛的意志。他们的所谓“民族独立”，“完全自治”，“宗教自由”等等，只是骗人的勾当而已。同时，既然达赖喇嘛是被劫持的，那末，他又怎么能够自由表达自己的意见呢？两个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，不是别人强加在他身上又是什么呢？不是印度扩张主义分子的遮丑布又是什么呢？
    印度的扩张主义分子的一切借口完全破产了！他们的原形毕露了！所谓“喜马拉雅山似的谎言”、“笨拙地坚持一个无耻的谎言”，奉还给印度扩张主义分子是最合适不过的。他们利用达赖喇嘛的名义来兴风作浪、干涉中国内政的种种丑恶的行径，可以休矣！
