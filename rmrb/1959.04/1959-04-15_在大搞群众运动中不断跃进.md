Continuously overcoming difficulties, continuously leaping forward; overcoming difficulties again, leaping forward again—this is a law governing the high-speed development of our socialist construction. In the first quarter of this year, Chongqing achieved a multiple increase in major products such as steel, iron, and coking coal by overcoming difficulties, which made us more and more aware of the profound significance of mastering this law.

Since the beginning of spring, in the further leap forward in production, we have encountered some difficulties in the shortage of raw materials, electricity, coking coal, transportation, and labor. Under the leadership of the Party, the city's workers united and fully carried forward the revolutionary heroic spirit of the working class. After three months of hard struggle, they achieved a major victory in the first battle of this year. Comparing the first quarter of this year with the same period last year: steel increased by 100.5%, iron increased by 123%, raw coal increased by 135.5%, and machinery manufacturing and other types of industry, transportation, and capital construction also had significant growth. More importantly, people have been further tempered in the struggle against difficulties. The vast number of cadres and the masses have not only strengthened their confidence and courage in overcoming difficulties but also created and accumulated rich experience in overcoming difficulties, gaining very valuable spiritual wealth.

Grasp the Favorable Situation, Actively Treat Difficulties, Adapt to Circumstances, and Advance Triumphantly

This year, Chongqing, like all parts of the country, saw an early and rapid production upsurge. This is primarily because the great victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 laid a broad foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward this year, providing a higher and broader starting point for the even greater leap forward this year. The summary of last year's work experience and the guiding principles for this year's work by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have made us more deeply aware of this favorable situation and clarified the direction of our struggle. According to the provincial party committee's guiding ideology of "grasping tightly from the beginning and throughout," we seized this favorable situation, guiding the vast number of cadres and the masses to advance triumphantly, further stimulating their soaring enthusiasm and courage to fight against difficulties.

To achieve a leap forward in the face of difficulties, we must correctly understand the difficulties and have extraordinary wisdom and courage. Chairman Mao told us to despise difficulties strategically and value them tactically, which means that we must have both the revolutionary heroic spirit of the working class and the working class's pragmatic and scientific attitude. We despise difficulties because we are confident that these difficulties are difficulties in the course of progress and that we have favorable conditions for overcoming them. First of all, there is the leadership of the Party and the infinite wisdom and strength of the masses, and any difficulty can be overcome. In fact, many difficulties have already been and are being overcome by us one by one. We value difficulties, however, valuing them on the premise of despising them, in order to overcome them. However, it is not easy to correctly recognize favorable conditions and to correctly treat difficulties. In the Great Leap Forward, if we are not good at conducting in-depth analysis of the interrelationship between subjective and objective conditions and their development and changes, only seeing the phenomenon but not the essence, only seeing the part but not the whole, seeing things but not people, it is easy to underestimate the dynamic role of people and waver in the face of difficulties. Therefore, strengthening socialist and communist ideological education and dialectical materialism education is very important. At the beginning of this year, the production tasks were heavy. In view of this situation, we guided everyone to recognize the situation from a dialectical point of view, on the basis of affirming the achievements of the work in 1958, and directed the enthusiasm of the masses to a tenacious struggle against difficulties. At the beginning of January, we successively convened political work conferences of factories and mines and representative conferences of advanced producers to discuss this year's leap forward targets, presenting both the favorable conditions and difficulties to the cadres and masses, and carried out extensive airing of views, big debates, and fully exposed contradictions. Everyone realized that the current difficulties are mainly due to the insufficiency of production in some areas. As long as the production in these areas increases, the difficulties will be overcome. Therefore, the fundamental measure is to vigorously develop production. The cadres and workers, due to the improvement of ideological understanding, further stimulated their enthusiasm, and the production targets leapt forward again and again, thus setting off a new upsurge of mass production on an even larger scale than last year at the beginning of this year, breaking the phenomenon of loose production in the beginning and tight production at the end of January in previous years.

After production went up, the contradictions of insufficient raw materials, coking coal, electricity, transportation, and labor became more prominent. At this time, we put forward the slogan of passing "five barriers," directing the soaring enthusiasm of the workers to breaking through the difficulties of raw materials, etc., and encouraged everyone to despise difficulties, launching a technical revolution movement focused on solving the difficulties of raw materials. Factories and mines adopted methods such as fully utilizing waste materials, widely using substitute materials, improving processes, simplifying machine structures, vigorously organizing raw material production, and doing a good job in inventory clearing and transfer to overcome the shortage of raw materials. For example, the Jiangling Machine Factory proposed 106 measures to solve the shortage of raw materials, enabling the total output value in February to be completed ahead of schedule. According to the projects that have been realized, it is estimated that one-fourth of the materials can be saved throughout the year. In this way, the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers became even greater, and the idea of daring to overcome difficulties was firmly established among the vast number of cadres and the masses.

As the workers comrades said, "Of thousands of things, putting politics in command is the most important. Of thousands of difficulties, relying on the masses is not difficult." "Giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself" has become a new social fashion. In this way, every time we overcome a difficulty, we move forward one step, and the production upsurge rises higher than the previous wave.

Adhere to Cadres Participating in Labor and Push the Mass Movement to Develop in Depth

Implementing the Party's mass line and vigorously carrying out mass movements are the fundamental lines for us to achieve any revolutionary task and construction task. To achieve this year's Great Leap Forward task, our work must be done more meticulously and more solidly, and the mass movement must be further developed in a sustained and in-depth manner. The experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 proved that vigorously carrying out mass movements on the industrial front must be based on "one handover, four big things, two participations, and three combinations." At the beginning of this year, we first grasped the central link of cadres participating in labor, stipulated the time and system for cadres to participate in labor, and organized work teams to go deep into the grassroots. Many party committee secretaries and factory directors of factories and mines went to the most critical places to participate in labor with the shifts; and continued to send a group of cadres down to work as workers. This further improved the style of cadres, greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers, and made production thrive. The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill, in response to the weak leadership and low production level of the late-night shift, organized a late-night shift work team composed of leading cadres and technical personnel to participate in labor with the shift, strengthen leadership, and timely discover and solve key problems in production. The hourly output of steel and the operating rate have rapidly exceeded those of the day and middle shifts.

Vigorously carrying out mass movements must be combined with the Party's centralized leadership. The Party's leadership role is to fully mobilize the masses, stand at the forefront of the mass movement, point out the direction and situation of the movement's development, grasp the main key in production, and lead the masses to break through the obstacles in the forward march. In the first quarter of this year, we vigorously carried out mass movements on the industrial front with technical revolution as the center and high yield and high quality as the goals. In response to the current difficulty of insufficient raw materials, we guided the masses to break through the raw material barrier and the sulfur barrier. Before a complete set of methods was found to subdue the problems of native iron and sulfur, everyone was racking their brains for this "Sulfur Demon King." At the beginning of February, we seized this key, mobilized the masses to air their views freely, brainstorm ideas, and concentrate our efforts to launch a sulfur attack. Through summarizing experience, finding rules, and creating a set of effective methods to encircle and annihilate sulfur from the material yard management to the ironmaking furnace and steelmaking furnace. This greatly enhanced the workers' confidence. They said, "Steel workers have great ambitions, they are not afraid of the sky or the earth, even the Jade Emperor and the Dragon King can be led away, what is a little sulfur?" In just half a month of hard work, the native iron with a sulfur content of more than 0.4% was smelted into qualified foreign steel. The output and quality of steel have also gradually improved.

The in-depth development of mass movements has not only overcome difficulties and promoted the leap forward in production; at the same time, it has also enriched the experience of vigorously carrying out mass movements. Particularly noteworthy is the new method of organizing production in vertical and horizontal "one dragon" created by the workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel in the sulfur attack struggle. According to the characteristics of the continuity and collectivity of steelmaking production, referring to the experience of two participations and three combinations, they organized the workers of the upper and lower shifts and left and right processes into a "one dragon" with the main process of front of furnace as the "dragon head," closely cooperating and coordinating with each other. As a result of implementing the vertical and horizontal "one dragon," workers participated in management more widely. The role of the three combinations was more prominent, the spirit of communist cooperation was greatly carried forward, the internal production relations of the enterprise were further improved, and the productive forces were developed.

Plant Red Flags, Establish Pace-Setters, Carry Out Joint Competitions, and Organize Large-Area Harvests

Grasping the advanced, planting red flags, and establishing pace-setters in all aspects are extremely important methods for vigorously carrying out mass movements, encouraging the people to move forward, and promoting a comprehensive leap forward in various tasks. Since last year, more than 100,000 advanced producers have emerged from various factories, mines, and enterprises in Chongqing. Through them taking ten, and ten taking a hundred, and layers of contests, comparisons, you chasing me, a vigorous and lively upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced has been created in the city, giving full play to the advanced figures and the huge role of advanced collectives in organizing the masses and inspiring enthusiasm, so that the advanced experience of a few people can be mastered by the majority, and the high yield of one person and one place can be transformed into a large-area harvest everywhere. According to incomplete statistics from January and February, the city's workers put forward more than 650,000 innovation suggestions, of which more than 400,000 have been realized. Many advanced producers have improved labor productivity from improving technology, equipment, etc., one machine tool is equivalent to several machine tools, one person is equivalent to several people, or even more people. Liao Shijie, a national industrial labor model and youth milling worker of Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, realized more than 60 rationalization proposals in January and February, of which some only improved the processing method, saving materials equivalent to six machine tools. Huang Rongchang, a national industrial labor model and technician of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, only made one large double-arm reciprocating crane, which can save 3,000 laborers. Driven by advanced figures, the number of advanced collectives has increased. Many other factories and mines have also seen many records of large-area high yields.

Since the end of February, we have organized departments closely related to steel production, such as coking coal, machinery, electricity, and capital construction, on the basis of the internal vertical and horizontal "one dragon" organization production competition, and carried out a city-wide joint competition with steel as the key link under the unified leadership of the municipal party committee. This kind of factory internal and external "one dragon" joint competition concretely expresses the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard" and the spirit of communist cooperation, large cooperation sets small cooperation, making the inside and outside of the enterprise form a production whole, one place has difficulties, hundreds of places support, promote each other, and further mobilize the positive factors in all aspects, which is more conducive to overcoming difficulties.

Continuously Solve the Contradictions in the Forward March, Leap Forward Again and Again

Things are constantly developing in contradiction. Through the efforts of the first quarter of this year, we have taken a step forward in continuously overcoming difficulties. However, some factories have begun to reveal some new contradictions: When the mass movement continues to deepen and production continues to leap forward, production management is prominently backward; when attention is paid to tapping production potential and giving full play to the role of existing equipment, the maintenance and repair of production equipment is neglected; when the enthusiasm of the masses is soaring and they are heroically fighting against difficulties, not enough attention is paid to safe production, and so on. At present, we are aiming at these weak links, mobilizing cadres and workers to air their views freely, carry out big debates, expose contradictions, and establish and improve the production responsibility system or other necessary systems on the basis of further improving consciousness and political responsibility to improve production management.

Through the practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the first quarter of this year, we have more and more deeply realized that: To conscientiously implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, we must have the great wisdom and courage of the working class and the tenacious fighting spirit of perseverance, and we must have the correct ideological method of dialectical materialism. Therefore, strengthening the Party's ideological and organizational construction is the foundation for doing all work well. While continuing to carry out in-depth socialist and communist ideological education and cadre dialectical materialism education, we are strengthening the work of the Party's grassroots organizations in factories and mines, giving play to the role of the Party branch and group as a fortress, and absorbing a group of outstanding members of the working class into the Party in the upsurge of the mass movement to expand the Party's ranks, in order to ensure the realization of this year's Great Leap Forward and complete and overfulfill the national plan outstandingly.

　　在大搞群众运动中不断跃进
　　中共重庆市委书记　任白戈
    不断克服困难，不断跃进；再克服困难，再跃进，这是我国社会主义建设事业高速度发展的一条规律。今年第一季度重庆市的钢、铁、煤焦等主要产品，在克服困难中获得成倍地增长，愈益体会到掌握这一规律的深刻意义。
    入春以来，在生产进一步的跃进中，在原材料、电力、煤焦、交通运输和劳动力不足上，遇到了一些的困难。全市职工在党的领导下，团结一致，充分发扬了工人阶级的革命英雄气概，经过三个月的苦战，取得了今年第一个战役的重大胜利。今年第一季度与去年同期比较：钢增长100.5％，铁增长123％，原煤增长135.5％，机械制造和其他各类工业、交通运输、基本建设等也都有显著的增长。更重要的，是在同困难作斗争中进一步锻炼了人。广大干部和群众不但增强了战胜困难的信心和勇气，而且创造积累了克服困难的丰富经验，获得了非常宝贵的精神财富。
    抓紧有利形势，积极对待困难，因势利导，乘胜挺进
    今年重庆和全国各地一样，生产高潮来得早，来得快，首先是因为1958年大跃进的伟大胜利为今年继续大跃进打下了宽厚的基础，使今年的更大跃进有了更高、更广的起脚点。党的八届六中全会对去年工作经验的总结，和对今年工作的方针指示，使我们更加深刻认识了这一有利形势，明确了奋斗的方向。我们根据省委“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的指导思想，抓紧这一有利形势，引导广大干部和群众乘胜挺进，更加激发了他们的冲天干劲和与困难作斗争的勇气。
    要在困难中实现跃进，就要正确认识困难，要有超乎寻常的大智大勇。毛主席告诉我们要在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，就是说：对待困难既要有工人阶级的革命英雄气概，又要有工人阶级实事求是的科学态度。藐视困难，是因为我们确信这些困难都是前进中的困难，而且具有克服困难的有利条件，首先是有党的领导和群众的无穷智慧与力量，任何困难都可以战胜。事实上，许多困难都已经和正在一个一个被我们克服当中。我们重视困难，则是在藐视困难的前提下去重视它，是为了战胜它才重视它。但是，既要正确认识有利条件，又要正确对待困难是不容易的。大跃进中对于主客观条件的相互关系及其发展变化，如果不善于进行深入的分析，只看到现象而看不到本质，只见局部而不见整体，见物不见人，就容易低估人的能动作用，在困难面前动摇。因此，加强社会主义、共产主义思想教育和辩证唯物主义的教育就十分重要。今年年初，生产任务繁重，针对这种情况，我们在肯定1958年工作成绩的基础上，引导大家用辩证法的观点，认清形势，把群众的干劲引向同困难作顽强的斗争。1月初，我们先后召开了厂矿企业政治工作会议和先进生产者代表大会，讨论今年跃进指标，把有利条件和困难一齐交给干部、群众，开展大鸣大放大辩论，充分揭露矛盾。大家认识到当前的困难，主要是某些方面生产的不足，只要这些方面的生产增加，困难也就克服了，因而，根本的措施是大力发展生产。干部、职工由于思想认识的提高，干劲进一步鼓起来了，生产指标一跃再跃，从而今年一开头就掀起了比去年规模更为巨大的群众生产新高潮，打破了历年来1月份生产前松后紧的现象。
    生产上去之后，紧接着原材料、煤焦、电力、运输和劳动力不足的矛盾就进一步突出了。这时，我们又提出过“五关”的口号，把职工的冲天干劲引向突破原材料等困难，鼓励大家藐视困难，开展了以解决原材料困难为重点的技术革命运动。各厂矿采取充分利用废旧料、广泛使用代用材料、改进工艺、简化机器结构、大力组织原材料生产以及作好清仓调剂工作等办法，克服原材料的不足。例如：江陵机器厂群众提出解决原材料不足的办法有一百零六项，使2月份生产总值提前完成。按已经实现的项目推算，全年可节约材料四分之一。这样，广大职工的劲头更大了，敢于战胜困难的思想在广大干部群众中巩固地树立起来了。
    工人同志说得好，“千条万条，政治挂帅第一条，千难万难，依靠群众就不难”。“把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己”已成为新的社会风尚。就这样，每当克服一个困难，我们就前进一步，生产高潮也就一浪高过一浪。
    坚持干部参加劳动，把群众运动推向纵深发展
    贯彻党的群众路线，大搞群众运动，是我们实现任何一项革命任务和建设任务的根本路线。要实现今年大跃进任务，我们的工作必须作得更加细致，更加扎实，群众运动也要进一步向持久的纵深发展。1958年大跃进的经验证明：在工业战线上大搞群众运动，必须以“一交四大两参三结合”为基础。今年一开头，我们首先抓紧了干部参加劳动这个中心环节，规定了干部参加劳动的时间和制度，组织了工作组深入基层。许多厂矿企业党委书记、厂长等领导干部都到最关键的地方去，跟班参加劳动；并继续下放了一批干部当工人。这就进一步改进了干部作风，大大鼓舞了广大职工的干劲，使生产蒸蒸日上。重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢厂针对深夜班领导力量薄弱、生产水平较低的情况，组织了由领导干部、技术人员参加深夜班工作组，跟班劳动，加强领导，及时发现解决了生产上的关键问题，钢材小时产量和作业率都迅速超过了白班和中班。
    大搞群众运动必须同党的集中领导相结合。党的领导作用，就是充分发动群众，站在群众运动的前面，指出运动发展的方向和形势，抓紧生产中的主要关键，率领群众突破前进中的障碍。今年第一季度，我们在工业战线上以技术革命为中心，以高产高质为目标，大搞群众运动，针对当前原材料不足的困难，引导群众突破了原材料关和硫磺关。在土铁硫高的问题没有找到成套的办法制服以前，大家都为这个“硫魔王”伤脑筋。2月初，我们抓住这一关键，发动群众大鸣大放，出主意，想办法，集中力量展开了一场攻硫大战。通过总结经验，寻找规律，创造了从料场管理到化铁炉、炼钢炉重重围歼硫磺的一套有效方法。这就大大增强了职工的信心。他们说：“钢铁工人志气大，天不怕来地不怕，玉帝龙王牵起走，小小硫磺算个啥。”仅半个月的奋战，把含硫高达0.4％以上的土铁炼成合格的洋钢。钢的产量、质量也都逐步有了提高。
    群众运动深入发展，不仅克服了困难，推动了生产的跃进；同时，也更加丰富了大搞群众运动的经验。特别值得注意的，是重钢职工在攻硫斗争中创造的纵横“一条龙”组织生产的新方法。他们根据炼钢生产连续性、集体性较大的特点，参照两参三结合的经验，以炉前这一主要工序为“龙头”，把上下班和左右工序的职工通盘组织起来，成为“一条龙”，一环扣一环，紧密协作、配合。实行纵横“一条龙”的结果，工人参加管理更加广泛了。三结合的作用更突出了，共产主义协作精神大大发扬，进一步改进了企业内部的生产关系，发展了生产力。
    插红旗，树标兵，开展联合竞赛，组织大面积丰收
    抓先进，插红旗，在各方面树立标兵，这是大搞群众运动，鼓舞人民前进，推动各项工作全面跃进的一个极其重要的方法。去年以来，重庆市各厂矿企业单位涌现出的先进生产者达十万人以上。通过他们以一带十，以十带百，层层打擂比武，你追我赶，造成了全市轰轰烈烈的学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮，充分发挥了先进人物和先进集体的组织群众、鼓舞干劲的巨大作用，使少数人的先进经验为多数人掌握，使一人一处高产变为处处大面积丰收。据1、2月份不完全的统计，全市职工提出的革新建议六十五万多件，已实现四十多万件。不少先进生产者从改进技术、设备等方面提高了劳动生产率，一部机床顶几部机床，一人顶几人，甚至更多的人。全国工业劳动模范、重庆建设机床厂青年铣工廖世刚同志，在1、2月份内就实现了合理化建议六十多项，其中有几件只是改进了加工方法，即节约相当于六部机床的材料，全国工业劳动模范、重庆钢铁公司技术员黄荣昌同志仅制成大型双臂往复起重机一项，即可节省三千个劳动力。经过先进人物的带动，先进集体增多了。其他不少厂矿也都出现了许多大面积丰产的纪录。
    2月底以来，我们又在企业内部纵横“一条龙”的组织生产竞赛的基础上，把与钢铁生产密切相关的煤焦、机械、电力、基本建设等部门组织起来，在市委统一领导下，开展了全市性的以钢为纲的联合大竞赛。这种厂内外“一条龙”的联合竞赛具体地表现了“全国一盘棋”思想和共产主义大协作精神，大协作套小协作，使企业内外形成一个生产整体，一处困难，百处支援，互相推动，互相促进，进一步调动了各方面的积极因素，更加有利于克服困难。
    不断解决前进中的矛盾，跃进再跃进
    事物是在矛盾中不断发展的。经过今年第一季度的努力，我们已在不断克服困难中前进了一步。但是，有些工厂又开始露出这样一些新的矛盾：当群众运动不断深入、生产不断跃进的时候，生产管理就突出地显得落后了；当注意挖掘生产潜力、充分发挥现有设备作用的时候，就忽略了对生产设备的维护、检修；当群众干劲冲天，英勇地向困难作斗争的时候，对安全生产又重视不够，等等。目前，我们正针对这些薄弱环节，发动干部、职工大鸣大放大辩论，揭露矛盾，在进一步提高自觉性和政治责任感的基础上，建立和健全生产责任制或其他一些必要的制度，改进生产管理。
    通过1958年大跃进和今年第一季度的实践，我们愈来愈深刻地体会到：要认真贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，必须要有工人阶级的大智大勇和坚韧不拔的顽强战斗精神，必须要有辩证唯物主义的正确思想方法。因此，加强党的思想建设和组织建设，乃是做好一切工作的基础。我们在继续进行深入社会主义、共产主义思想教育和干部辩证唯物主义教育的同时，正在厂矿企业加强党的基层组织的工作，发挥党支部、小组的堡垒作用，并在群众运动的高潮中吸收一批工人阶级的优秀分子入党，壮大党的队伍，以保证实现今年的大跃进，出色地完成和超额完成国家计划。
