Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: This year, national state-owned farms and ranches across the country will hand over a large quantity of meat, milk, eggs, fruits, oil crops, and industrial raw material crops, etc., to the state.

The Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation recently convened a production meeting with representatives from major national state-owned farms and ranches across the country. At the meeting, they listened to the report on the production guidelines and tasks of state-owned farms and ranches made by Wang Zhen, Minister of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation. After heated discussions, the production task targets for this year were determined.

China's state-owned agricultural and animal husbandry enterprises, whether in the major reclamation areas of Xinjiang, Northeast, or South China, or in various provinces and regions in the interior, have achieved unprecedented development last year. The level of mechanization in the production processes of state-owned farms and ranches, such as plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, and chopping livestock feed, has been greatly improved, setting a demonstration role for the mechanization and electrification of agricultural and animal husbandry production in our country. The meeting believed that, under the situation of the great leap forward in agriculture across the country, state-owned farms and ranches should, in the future, proceed from local conditions, give full play to the superiority of ownership by the whole people, and, in addition to vigorously producing industrial raw materials such as soybeans, cotton, and special tropical crops according to national plans, should also vigorously develop the production of pigs, sheep, cattle, chickens, ducks, eggs, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables.

The meeting determined that, in 1959, in addition to undertaking the task of supplying agricultural and animal products to industrial and mining areas and cities locally, the state-owned farms and ranches in various regions will have the following production tasks for products that are to be allocated uniformly by the state: 400,000 live pigs, 50,000 tons of frozen pork, 12,000 tons of frozen poultry meat, 10,000 tons of fresh eggs, 630,000 tons of soybeans, 50,000 tons of vegetable oil, and 100,000 tons of starch. The representatives present unanimously stated that all staff and workers of national state-owned farms and ranches must go all out, strive to overfulfill the production tasks of the above-mentioned commodities, continue to expand the area of wasteland reclamation, expand the breeding stock, and create conditions for further increasing the output of agricultural and animal products and their commodity rate in 1960.

At the meeting, representatives from various regions heatedly discussed this year's production guidelines and tasks. They unanimously believed that the production and management guidelines for state-owned farms and ranches instructed by the Central Committee and the State Council are completely correct, and it is glorious to undertake the production tasks of agricultural and animal products urgently needed by the state. All staff and workers must take the advanced workers on the national socialist construction labor front as examples, learn from the advanced experience of Soviet state-owned farms, strive to learn the science and technology of agricultural and animal husbandry production, implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," have cadres participate in labor, improve labor productivity, practice strict economy, reduce production costs, produce high-quality products, and fulfill the task of handing over commodities ahead of schedule and in excess of the quota.

Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: The Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation has signed supply contracts with the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Ministry of Food and other departments for the sale of agricultural and animal products from national state-owned farms and ranches to commercial departments in 1959.

The contract stipulates that state-owned farms and ranches in various regions should deliver the commodities produced, such as soybeans, pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, eggs, and other agricultural and animal products, to the above-mentioned commercial departments on time, in accordance with quality standards, and in the required quantities, according to the national plan. The contract also stipulates that if the frozen meat, frozen poultry, etc., supplied by the farms and ranches need to be processed on their behalf by the commercial departments, the commercial departments in various regions should guarantee the completion of this processing task.

This contract was signed on March 27th in the auditorium of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation under the guidance of the Fifth and Seventh Offices of the State Council. Responsible cadres from the Fifth Office and Seventh Office of the State Council, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Food, and representatives from major state-owned farms and ranches in various regions participated in the signing ceremony. Wang Zhen, Minister of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, Tao Huanfu, Deputy Director of the Seventh Office of the State Council, and Lu Xuzhang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, delivered speeches before the contract was signed.

    充分发挥全民所有制的优越性
    国营农牧场将生产大批农畜产品
    全国农牧场和商业部门签订交售农畜产品合同
    新华社4日讯　全国国营农牧场今年将生产大量肉类、奶、蛋、果品、油料作物和工业原料作物等商品上交给国家。
    农垦部最近召开有全国主要国营农牧场代表参加的生产会议。会上，听了农垦部部长王震所作的关于国营农牧场的生产方针任务的报告，经过热烈讨论，确定了今年的生产任务指标。
    我国国营农牧企业，无论在新疆、东北、华南几大垦区，或者在内地各省区，去年都得到空前发展。国营农牧场耕翻土地、播种、收割、脱粒和畜牧饲料碎切等生产过程的机械化程度，已经大为提高，为我国农牧业生产机械化电气化起了示范作用。会议认为，在全国农业大跃进的形势下，国营农牧场今后应当因地制宜，充分发挥全民所有制的优越性，除了按照国家计划大力生产大豆、棉花和热带特种作物等工业原料以外，还应当大力发展猪、羊、牛、鸡、鸭、蛋品、奶品、果品、蔬菜等的生产。
    会议确定，各地国营农牧场在1959年除了担任就地供应工矿区城市农牧产品的任务以外，由国家统一调拨的产品，生产任务是活猪四十万头、冻猪肉五万吨、冻禽肉一万二千吨、鲜蛋一万吨、大豆六十三万吨、植物油五万吨、淀粉十万吨。到会代表一致表示，全国国营农牧场全体职工一定要鼓足干劲，争取超额完成上述商品的生产任务，继续扩大开荒面积，扩大种畜群，为1960年进一步提高农畜产品产量和它的商品率创造条件。
    会上，各地代表热烈地讨论了今年的生产方针任务。他们一致认为，中央和国务院所指示的国营农牧场生产经营的方针是完全正确的，承担国家所迫切需要的农畜产品的生产任务是光荣的。全体职工一定要以全国社会主义建设劳动战线的先进者作为榜样，学习苏联国营农场的先进经验，努力学习农牧业生产的科学技术，贯彻执行“八字宪法”，干部参加劳动，提高劳动生产率，厉行节约，降低生产成本，生产优质产品，提前超额完成上交商品的任务。
    新华社4日讯　农垦部已经同商业部、对外贸易部和粮食部等部门签订了1959年全国国营农牧场向商业部门交售农畜产品的供货合同。
    合同规定：各地国营农牧场应按照国家计划，将生产的商品大豆、猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭、蛋等及其他农畜产品，按时、按质、按量交付上述各商业部门。合同还规定：农牧场供应的冻肉、冻家禽等需由商业部门代加工时，各地商业部门应保证完成此项代加工任务。
    这一合同是在国务院第五办公室和第七办公室指导下，3月27日在农垦部礼堂签订的。参加签订仪式的有国务院第五办公室、第七办公室、农垦部、对外贸易部、商业部、粮食部等单位的负责干部，各地主要国营农牧场的代表。农垦部部长王震、国务院第七办公室副主任陶桓馥、对外贸易部副部长卢绪章，在合同签订前讲了话。
