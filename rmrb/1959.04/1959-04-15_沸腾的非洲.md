　　Boiling Africa
    Amidst the surging global anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist struggles, the African continent, from the tip of Guardafui in the east to Dakar in the west, and from Bizerte in the north to Cape Town in the south, is churning with giant waves of movements striving for and defending national independence.

    The Great March Towards Independence

    The African continent has a total of fifty-nine countries and regions, with approximately 241,125,000 people residing on its 30,034,980 square kilometers of land. Currently, there are forty-two countries and regions that have either achieved independence or are actively striving for it and voicing their demands for independence, covering an area of 28,303,800 square kilometers and a population of approximately 235,390,000. These forty-two countries and regions can be further divided into: independent countries, countries nearing independence, republics participating in the "French Community," and countries actively striving for national independence.

    1.  The independent countries and regions include the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, the Union of South Africa, Sudan, and Tunisia, totaling ten countries. Although the Algerian people are still suffering from French colonial enslavement, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic was established last year. These eleven countries have a total land area of 10,953,400 square kilometers, accounting for 36.5% of the total area of Africa, and a population of 101,977,500, accounting for approximately 42.2% of the African population.

    2.  There are four countries nearing independence: Cameroon, Nigeria, Togo, and Italian-administered Somaliland, with a total area of 2,003,500 square kilometers and a population of 47,440,000. The long-term and heroic struggles of the people of these countries have finally forced the colonial powers to agree to grant them independence in 1960.

    3.  The republics participating in the "French Community" include Niger, Mauritania, Upper Volta, Sudan (French), Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Senegal, Gabon, Chad, Congo (French), Central African Republic (Ubangi-Shari), Madagascar, and twelve other countries, with an area of 7,480,000 square kilometers and a total population of 26,270,000. These were all formerly French colonies. After the French referendum on September 28 last year, they became republics within the "French Community," but their military, economic, diplomatic, judicial, and higher education powers remain under the control of the French colonialists. The people of these countries are fighting for complete independence.

    4.  There are approximately fifteen countries and regions actively striving for national independence: Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, Somaliland, and Basutoland under British rule, French Somaliland, Congo and Ruanda-Urundi under Belgian rule, Sahara and Ifni under Spanish rule, and Angola and Mozambique under Portuguese rule. The people of these countries and regions have already taken or are taking various forms of struggle, such as demonstrations, strikes, riots, and armed struggles, to fight for national independence.

    There are seventeen other African countries and regions, including ten groups of oceanic islands. Although they have not yet put the task of fighting for national independence on the agenda, they are not calm and peaceful; rather, they are on the eve of a storm.

    Africa, once called the "Dark Continent" by the West, is now radiating the brilliant light of striving for independence and freedom, aiming to burn the evil colonial system to ashes.

    Shameful and Shocking Plunder

    However, the struggle of the African people for independence and freedom is still in an extremely difficult and complex situation. Western European colonialists are making bloody death throes, and American imperialism is also desperately expanding into Africa. Africa's rich resources are being even more greedily exploited, and the lives of the African people are extremely painful.

    Africa's resources have become a blood transfusion site nourishing Western imperialism. The capitalist world has plundered 98% of its diamonds, over 80% of its cobalt, 60% of its gold, 42% of its antimony, about 40% of its chromium, 36% of its manganese, 30% of its phosphate rock from Africa.

    The profits seized by colonialists from Africa are staggering. British mining companies, with a total capital of only 70 million pounds, obtained a net profit of 200 million pounds from Africa in 1955 alone. At the end of 1956, British investment in Rhodesia and Nyasaland totaled 130 million pounds, and the interest and dividends obtained in one year amounted to 17.7 million pounds, not including all the profits obtained by British companies there.

    Colonial countries use price suppression and forced acquisition methods to seize African agricultural products. Monopolies in French West Africa purchase local bananas and cocoa at a price of one and twenty francs, respectively, but can sell them for fifty and one hundred and eighty francs when transported to Paris. British monopolies purchase Nigerian peanuts at a price of thirty pounds per ton, but sell them for one hundred and fifty-six pounds.

    In the Congo, Kenya, and Northern Rhodesia, Europeans, who account for only 1% to 2% of the total local population, seize 70% to 95% of the total income of these countries.

    Three thousand white immigrants in Kenya occupy half of the country's cultivated land, while 5.5 million Africans are concentrated on one-fifth of the barren land. In Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, 72% of the land is occupied by several British monopolies. In Southwest Africa, whites, who account for 10% of the population, occupy more than 37 million hectares of land, while Africans, who account for 90% of the total population, are concentrated in 22 million hectares of special residential areas. In the Union of South Africa, Africans, who account for 87% of the population, have only 12% of the arable land.

    In recent years, American investment in Africa has increased rapidly. By 1958, the total value of American investment in Africa had reached 2 billion US dollars. In 1950, American investment in Libya was only 82 million US dollars, but by 1957 it had increased to 380 million US dollars. In Liberia, the Union of South Africa, and the Congo, American investment has surpassed that of Britain, France, and other countries, ranking first.

    In 1957, 71% of American investment in Africa was invested in the oil and mining sectors. The United States has obtained oil exploration rights in Mozambique, Angola, and Northern Nigeria, and is also conducting oil exploration in North Africa and the east coast of Africa. One piece of land for which the American Mozambique Oil Company obtained exploration rights is about one and a half times larger than Portugal itself. The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Dillon himself is an African oil tycoon. He has several companies that own a large number of oil exploitation rights in Africa, owning one-third of the interests in the 35 million acres of oil fields licensed in Libya and the 23 million acres of oil fields licensed in British Somaliland. In addition, he also owns one-sixth of the interests in the 61 million acres of oil fields licensed in Italian Somaliland. American monopoly capital has controlled the Libyan economy, obtained most of the uranium products from the Belgian Congo, and also monopolized South Africa's uranium production. It is now penetrating the Sahara oil region.

    We Can No Longer Live Like This

    Colonial enslavement and plunder have plunged the African people into indescribable suffering.

    African workers generally work more than a dozen hours a day, and the corvée system is prevalent. However, workers' wages are extremely low. The wages of African workers in Northern Rhodesia are only one-thirteenth to one-seventeenth of those of European workers, less than one-twentieth in the Union of South Africa, one-thirty-fourth in Kenya, and one-sixty-fourth in the Congo. The average wage of Africans in Nyasaland, after deducting taxes, only accounts for 20% to 40% of the local minimum living expenses.

    A worker in the Congo earns enough to buy a pack of matches in a day.

    The average illiteracy rate in the entire African continent is about 90%. In French Africa, Tanganyika, Nigeria, Kenya, and Angola, illiteracy accounts for about 99% of the total population. Togo accounts for 95%, and the Congo accounts for 97%.

    The mortality rate of Africans is extremely high, with an average life expectancy of less than thirty years. The infant mortality rate is even higher. In Cameroon, more than 65% of infants do not live to one year old. In Sierra Leone, the Congo, and Kenya, the infant mortality rate is around 50%.

    In the Congo, more than 50% of people suffer from malaria. In Nigeria, there are 500,000 people suffering from leprosy. On the French island of Réunion, 25,000 out of 70,000 people suffer from tuberculosis. In Nigeria, there is only one doctor for every 130,000 people. In Portuguese Guinea, there is only one obstetrician for every 500,000 people.

    The colonialists' huge profits are built on the deep suffering of the African people. But the African people can no longer live like this; they are standing up to fight for independence and freedom.

　　沸腾的非洲
    在全世界反殖民主义反帝国主义斗争汹涌澎湃的形势下，非洲大陆东起瓜达富伊角西至达喀尔，北起比塞大南至开普顿，到处翻腾着争取和维护民族独立运动的巨浪。
    走向独立的大进军
    非洲大陆共有五十九个国家和地区，约有二亿四千一百二十五万人口居住在这三千零三万四千九百八十多平方公里的土地上。目前已经取得独立或者正在积极争取独立和发出要求独立呼声的国家和地区有四十二个，面积为二千八百三十万三千八百多平方公里，人口约二亿三千五百三十九万多。这四十二个国家和地区又可分为：已经独立的国家、行将独立的国家、参加“法兰西共同体”的共和国、正在积极争取民族独立的国家。
    一、已经独立的国家和地区有阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区、埃塞俄比亚、加纳、几内亚、利比里亚、利比亚、摩洛哥、南非联邦、苏丹和突尼斯等十个国家。阿尔及利亚人民虽仍遭受着法国的殖民奴役，但阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府也已于去年成立了。这十一个国家的土地面积共有一千零九十五万三千四百多平方公里，占全非总面积的36.5％，人口有一亿零一百九十七万七千五百多人，约占非洲人口42.2％。
    二、行将独立的国家有四个，即喀麦隆、尼日利亚、多哥和意大利托管的索马里兰，总面积是二百万三千五百多平方公里，人口为四千七百四十四万多人。这些国家人民长期英勇的斗争，终于迫使殖民国家同意它们在1960年取得独立地位。
    三、参加“法兰西共同体”的共和国有尼日尔、毛里塔尼亚、沃尔特、苏丹（法属）、象牙海岸、达荷美、塞内加尔、加蓬、乍得、刚果（法属）中非共和国（乌班吉沙立）、马达加斯加等十二个国家，面积有七百四十八万平方公里，人口共二千六百二十七万多人。它们过去都是法国的殖民地，去年9月28日法国举行公民投票后，成了“法兰西共同体”内的共和国，其军事、经济、外交、司法、高等教育等大权仍然控制在法国殖民者手中。这些国家人民正在为争取完全独立而斗争。
    四、正在积极争取民族独立的国家和地区共约十五个：英国统治下的北罗得西亚、南罗得西亚、尼亚萨兰、怯尼亚、坦噶尼喀、乌干达、索马里兰和巴苏陀兰，法属索马里兰，比利时统治下的刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪，西班牙统治下的撒哈拉和伊夫尼，葡萄牙统治下的安哥拉和莫三鼻给等。这些国家和地区的人民已经或正在采取示威、罢工、暴动以及武装斗争等各种各样的斗争方式来争取民族独立。
    还有包括十个海洋岛群在内的其它十七个非洲国家和地区，虽然目前没有把争取民族独立斗争的任务提到日程上来，但那里并不是平静无事，而是处于暴风雨的前夜。
    被西方称为“黑暗大陆”的非洲，正在放射着争取独立自由的万丈光芒，要把罪恶的殖民制度烧成灰烬。
    可耻的惊人掠夺
    但是，非洲人民争取独立自由的斗争，仍然处于极为艰苦和复杂的境地。西欧殖民主义者正在进行血腥的垂死挣扎，美帝国主义也拚命向非洲扩张。非洲富饶的资源受到更为贪婪的榨取，非洲人民的生活极为痛苦。
    非洲的资源成了滋养西方帝国主义的输血场所。资本主义世界有98％的钻石、80％以上的钴、60％的金、42％的锑、40％左右的铬、36％的锰、30％的磷石、27％的铜，是自非洲掠夺去的。
    殖民主义者从非洲攫取的利润至为惊人。资本总额只有七千万英镑的英国各个采矿公司，在1955年一年中就从非洲取得了两亿英镑的纯利润。英国1956年底在罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰的投资总额为一亿三千万镑，一年中所得的利息和股息为一千七百七十万镑，还不包括英国公司在这里获得的全部利润。
    殖民国家采取压价和强制收购办法，攫取非洲的农产品。法属西非垄断组织以一个和二十个法郎的价格购买当地的香蕉和可可，运到巴黎时可卖五十法郎和一百八十法郎。英国垄断组织以每吨三十英镑的价格收购尼日利亚的花生，而卖出价格是一百五十六英镑。
    在刚果、怯尼亚和北罗得西亚，仅占本地居民总数1％至2％的欧洲人夺取了这些国家全部收入的70％—95％。
    怯尼亚三千白种移民占有全国耕地面积的一半，五百五十万非洲人被集中在全国五分之一的贫瘠土地上。北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰有72％的土地被英国几家垄断公司所占有。在西南非洲，占人口10％的白种人占据了三千七百多万公顷的土地，而占总人口90％的非洲人却被集中在二千二百万公顷的特别住区内。南非联邦占87％的非洲人却只有12％的可耕地。
    几年来美国在非洲的投资迅速增加。到1958年，美国在非洲投资总值已达二十亿美元。1950年美国在利比亚的投资还只有八千二百万美元，而到1957年已增加到三亿八千万美元。在利比里亚、南非联邦和刚果等地，美国投资已超过英法等国而跃居首位。
    1957年美国在非洲的投资，71％投于石油和采矿部门。美国在莫三鼻给、安哥拉和北尼日利亚等地取得了石油勘测权。还在北非和非洲东海岸进行石油勘探。美国莫三鼻给石油公司取得勘探权的一块土地就比葡萄牙本土大一倍半左右。美国副国务卿狄龙本人就是一个非洲石油大亨。他有好几个公司在非洲拥有大量石油开采权，在利比亚特许的三千五百万英亩油田开采权中，和在英属索马里兰特许的二千三百万英亩油田开采权中，都拥有三分之一的利益，此外，在意属索马里兰特许的六千一百万英亩油田开采权中也占有六分之一的利益。美国垄断资本已控制着利比亚经济，取得了比属刚果的大部分铀矿产品，还垄断了南非的铀矿生产，现正在向撒哈拉油区渗透。不能再过这样的生活
    殖民主义的奴役和掠夺，使非洲人民陷于难以形容的苦难生活中。
    非洲工人一般劳动时间每天都超过十几个小时，苦役制盛行。但工人的工资收入则极低。北罗得西亚非洲工人工资只占欧洲工人工资的十三分之一到十七分之一，南非联邦还不及二十分之一，怯尼亚是三十四分之一，刚果六十四分之一。尼亚萨兰的非洲人的平均工资在扣除赋税后只占当地最低生活费用的20％到40％。
    刚果工人一天所得工资还不够买一包火柴。
    整个非洲大陆人口中平均文盲率为90％左右，在法属非洲、坦噶尼喀、尼日利亚、怯尼亚和安哥拉的文盲占总人口的99％左右。多哥占95％、刚果占97％。
    非洲人的死亡率极高，平均活不到三十岁。儿童的死亡率更高。喀麦隆有65％以上的婴儿活不到一周岁。在塞拉勒窝内、刚果、怯尼亚的儿童死亡率都在50％左右。
    在刚果有50％以上的人患疟疾。尼日利亚患麻疯病的有五十万。法属留尼汪岛在七万人中就有两万五千人患结核病。在尼日利亚，十三万人中才有一个医生。葡属几内亚的五十万人口中，也只有一名产科医生。
    殖民主义者的巨额利润正是建立在非洲人民深重的苦难上。但非洲人民不能再过这样的日子了，他们正在站起来，争取独立和自由。
