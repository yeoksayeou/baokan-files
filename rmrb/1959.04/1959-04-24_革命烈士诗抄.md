Excerpts from Poems of Revolutionary Martyrs

    On a Portrait of Jiang Weiping
    Li Dazhao
    This man's spirit is still heroic; the river flows for eternity.
    Crimson blood makes several spring flowers; scattered tears moisten a mound of earth.
    No longer hear the roaring voice, only hear the sobbing water.
    Night after night at the empty riverbank, it seems a dragon is rising.

    Years
    Li Shaoshi
    Forty years of age is not really old, but bearing a burden like yours is rare.
    Hardly can we gather for a cup of wine on your birthday, let alone raise the tray in wifely devotion.
    Snowy mountains cannot stop the path of the expeditionary force, nor can frosty prisons grind down the warrior's spirit.
    Living up to the relentless hard work, we shall see red flags flying all over China.

    Leave a Loyal Heart to Illuminate History
    Lü Huisheng
    How can I bear to see the country broken? I am willing to shed my crimson blood!
    Open up the enemy's rear in the smoke and dust, and expand the people's plans in the commotion.
    For eight years, I have held a firm heart, and repaid the country with loyalty and integrity.
    Glad to see the dawn breaking, what do I seek in death?

    Last Poem
    Xu Fanting
    Naked and bare, let me go or stay, what does a man seek in this world?
    I fear the people's spirit will be utterly destroyed, I am willing to exchange my body for freedom.

    革命烈士诗抄
    题蒋卫平遗像
    李大钊
    斯人气尚雄，江流自千古。
    碧血几春花，零泪一坏土。
    不闻叱咤声，但听呜咽水。
    夜夜空江头，似有蛟龙起。
    行年
    李少石
    行年四十原非老，荷重如君便已稀。
    难得称觴日聚首，况能举案效齐眉。
    雪山未阻征人路，霜狱宁磨战士姿？
    不负埋头双苦斗，神州遍地见红旗。
    留取丹心照汗青
    吕惠生
    忍看山河碎？愿将赤血流！
    烟尘开敌后，扰攘展民猷。
    八载坚心志，忠贞为国酬。
    且欣天破晓，竟死我何求。
    绝命诗
    续范亭
    赤膊条条任去留，丈夫于世何所求？
    窃恐民气摧残尽，愿把身躯易自由。
