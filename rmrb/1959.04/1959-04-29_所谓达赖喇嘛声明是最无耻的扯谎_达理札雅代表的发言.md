Dá lǐ zhá yǎ representative's speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I will resolutely implement them in future practical work.

Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" is a comprehensive and systematic summary of the achievements and experiences of our country's socialist construction's Great Leap Forward. It points out the bright and splendid future of our country, greatly encouraging the confidence of all ethnic groups in the country to build socialism. After listening to this report, I felt infinitely excited and deeply realized that only under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can all minority ethnic groups be liberated from poverty, backwardness, enslavement, exploitation, and oppression, and enter the great era of socialist construction characterized by equality, friendship, and prosperity for all ethnic groups. Like other regions, Bayannur League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved rapid development in industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production under the guidance of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction. Great achievements have also been made in cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and people's lives have gradually improved. I would now like to report to the conference on the situation regarding desert control.

Harnessing Deserts for the Benefit of the People

The desert area of Bayannur League is approximately 270 million mu (including 105 million mu of Gobi), accounting for about 55 percent of the total land area of the League. These deserts are mainly distributed in Alxa Banner, Ejin Banner, and Urad Middle and Rear United Banner. Other banners and counties also have scattered deserts. These shifting sands, rampant with the wind, engulf farmland and pastures, block transportation, threaten rivers, fill canals, bury villages, affect industrial and mining construction, and bring serious harm to people's production and lives.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of people have actively engaged in the battle to transform the deserts and have achieved great success. The sand control forest belt, stretching 353 li from Sanshenggong in Dengkou County to Taiyangmiao in Hangjin Rear Banner, with an average width of 300 meters, is now full of green trees. In Dengkou County, 1.24 million mu of sand-fixed and grass-cultivated areas have been covered with vegetation, basically stopping the encroachment of shifting sands. In particular, last year's Northwest Six Provinces and Autonomous Regions Desert Control Conference held in Hohhot greatly encouraged our desert control work. According to the spirit of this conference, we have put forward a preliminary plan for transforming the deserts. The plan requires: the scattered deserts in agricultural areas to be transformed in one to two years and completed in three years; the Ulan Buh Desert in Alxa Banner to be transformed in three to five years; the Tengger Desert in that banner and the deserts in Ejin Banner and Middle and Rear United Banner to be transformed in seven years; the Badanjilin Desert in Alxa Banner to be transformed in seven to ten years; and the Gobi in Ejin Banner, Alxa Banner, and Middle and Rear United Banner to gradually vegetate in five, seven, or ten years. After the deserts are fixed, actively carry out comprehensive greening, realize the gardenization of the land, and transform the deserts into forestry and animal husbandry bases. The specific planned tasks for desert transformation this year are: afforestation of 500,000 mu, seedling cultivation of 60,000 mu, seed collection of 12 million jin, and grass planting of 1.15 million mu. Judging from the results of the first battle of spring afforestation, this plan is entirely achievable.

Although the desert area of Bayannur League is very large, complete transformation is indeed an arduous task. However, with the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the broad masses of people, we will be invincible and victorious in every battle. We are confident that we will be able to complete the glorious task of transforming and utilizing the deserts.

The Tibetan Upper-Class Reactionary Clique Embarks on a Path of Self-Destruction

A group of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet, against the will of the Tibetan people, kidnapped the Dalai Lama and created an armed rebellion. Their aim was to undermine the unification of the motherland, divide the unity of all ethnic groups, continue to maintain their most reactionary feudal serf system rule, and try their best to prevent the progress and development of the Tibetan people, dreaming of keeping the Tibetan people forever in the painful abyss of poverty and backwardness. This heinous crime of betraying the motherland and betraying the interests of the nation immediately aroused great indignation among the people of the whole country and was met with denunciation and condemnation from the people of the whole country. The State Council's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion is entirely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country, and has therefore been warmly supported by the people of the whole country.

Now the armed rebellion in Tibet has been quickly quelled, and a handful of traitors have suffered a shameful defeat and are heading down the path of self-destruction. However, British imperialists and Indian expansionists are not reconciled to their failure. Recently, they used the name of the Dalai Lama to create a so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." This statement, full of loopholes and absurd content, is a complete distortion of facts and a reversal of black and white, and is the most shameless lie. Their attempt to interfere in our country's internal affairs and split the unity of our motherland is a futile scheme.

The failure of the Tibetan rebels marks the total collapse of the feudal ruling class in Tibet, which will greatly promote the rebirth of the Tibetan people, enabling them to unite more closely in the great family of socialist friendship and cooperation under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and accelerate their pace towards great socialism. Let all the people of our country unite firmly under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, exert greater efforts, and accelerate socialist construction. I was born into a feudal aristocratic family, but the Party has adopted a policy of unity and transformation towards me, encouraging me to transform and helping me to progress. I must study the Party's policies well, strengthen ideological transformation, and contribute all my strength to the construction of the motherland.

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country!

Long live Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of all ethnic groups!

### 所谓达赖喇嘛声明是最无耻的扯谎  达理札雅代表的发言

专栏：

    所谓达赖喇嘛声明是最无耻的扯谎
    达理札雅代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并在今后的实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    周总理的“政府工作报告”是全面系统的总结了我国社会主义建设大跃进的成就和经验，指出了我们国家光辉灿烂的幸福前途，大大的鼓舞了全国各族人民建设社会主义的信心。我听了这个报告之后，心里感到无限的兴奋，深深的体会到，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，各少数民族才能从贫困落后，被奴役、剥削、压迫下解放出来，进入各民族平等友爱、繁荣发展的社会主义建设的伟大时代。内蒙古自治区巴彦淖尔盟也像其他地区一样，在党的建设社会主义总路线的指导下，在工农牧业生产上，有了飞跃的发展，文教卫生事业也取得了很大成就，人民生活也逐渐得到了提高和改善，我现在就治理沙漠方面的情况，向大会作以下汇报。
    治理沙漠  造福人民
    巴彦淖尔盟沙漠面积约两亿七千万亩（包括戈壁一亿零五百万亩在内），约占全盟总土地面积的百分之五十五。这些沙漠主要分布在阿拉善旗，额济纳旗和乌拉特中后联合旗境内，其他各旗县也均有零星的沙漠。这些流沙随风泛滥，吞没农田牧场，阻断交通，威胁河流，填塞渠道，埋没村庄，影响工矿建设，给人民生产和生活带来了严重的危害。
    几年来，在党的领导下，广大人民群众积极投入了改造沙漠的战斗，取得了很大的成就。从磴口县三盛公到杭锦后旗太阳庙，营造起来的长达三百五十三华里，平均宽达三百公尺的防沙林带，已经绿树成荫。磴口县的封沙育草区，已经有一百二十四万亩成了草木复被，基本上制止住流沙侵袭。特别是去年中央在呼和浩特召开的西北六省、自治区治沙会议，对我们在治沙工作方面给了极大的鼓舞，我们根据此次会议精神，提出了一个改造沙漠的初步规划。规划中要求：农业区的分散沙漠，在一两年内实现改造，三年扫尾；阿旗的乌兰布和沙漠，三年到五年内实现改造；该旗的腾格里沙漠和额旗、中后联合旗的沙漠，七年内实现改造；阿旗的巴丹吉林沙漠，七年到十年内实现改造；额旗、阿旗、中后联合旗的戈壁，争取在五年、七年或十年内逐步使其植被。沙漠固定后，积极进行全面绿化，实现大地园林化，把沙漠改造成林业、牧业基地。今年改造沙漠的具体计划任务是：造林五十万亩，育苗六万亩，采种一千二百万斤，种草一百一十五万亩。从春季造林第一个战役的成果来看，这个计划是完全可以实现的。
    巴彦淖尔盟沙漠面积虽然很大，完全改造确实是个艰巨的任务，但是，我们有党的领导，有广大人民群众的努力战斗，就能攻无不克，战无不胜。我们有信心一定能完成改造沙漠和利用沙漠的光荣任务。
    西藏上层反动集团走上自取灭亡之路
    西藏一部分上层反动集团，违背西藏人民的意志，劫持达赖喇嘛，制造了武装叛乱，其目的是企图破坏祖国的统一，分裂各民族的团结，继续维护他们最反动的封建农奴制度的统治，极力阻止西藏人民的进步和发展，梦想使西藏人民永远陷于贫困、落后的痛苦深渊，这种背叛祖国、背叛民族利益的滔天罪行，立刻引起了全国人民的极大愤慨，受到了全国人民的声讨和谴责。国务院关于解散原西藏地方政府，彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令，是完全符合西藏人民和全国人民利益的，因而受到了全国人民一致的热烈拥护。
    现在西藏的武装叛乱已被迅速平息，一小撮叛国分子遭到了可耻的失败，走向了自取灭亡的道路。但是，英帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子还不甘心于自己的失败，最近他们假借达赖喇嘛的名义，搞了一个什么所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这个漏洞百出，内容荒谬的声明，完全是歪曲事实，颠倒黑白的捏造，是最无耻的扯谎。他们这种企图干涉我国内政，分裂我们祖国的统一的阴谋诡计是枉费心机的。
    西藏叛乱分子的失败，标志着西藏的封建统治阶级的总崩溃，这将大大促进西藏人民的新生，使西藏人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，将会更加紧密的团结在社会主义友爱合作的大家庭里，加快步伐向伟大的社会主义迈进。让我们全国各族人民巩固的团结在党和毛主席的领导下，鼓足更大的干劲，加速社会主义建设。我是出身于封建贵族家庭，但是党对我采取了团结改造的政策，鼓励我改造，帮助我进步，我一定要很好的学习党的政策，加强思想改造，在为祖国的建设事业中贡献自己的全部力量。
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    全国各族人民大团结万岁！
    各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！
