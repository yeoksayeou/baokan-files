　　A stage was set up on the grassland. In front of the stage, a long row of yak butter lamps were placed. One golden flame connected to another golden flame, like a long string of bright nocturnal pearls. On the stage, a red banner was hung, with Tibetan and Han characters written on it: "Performance to Comfort the People's Liberation Army."

　　The actors were all primary school students: herdboy on the grassland, water-carrying girls by the Yarlung Zangbo River, and children who lived by collecting branches and mushrooms. But no one expected their songs to be so loud and clear, their dances to be so neat and uniform. There was a child of eight or nine years old, his hair as fluffy as a little lion, his sleeves swinging like a horse's tail, but look at his feet! Look at his little leather shoes! "Tick-tock, tock-tock..." what a sonorous and powerful sound!

　　The People's Liberation Army soldiers sat on their backpacks in front of the stage, row upon row, very neatly. The soldiers were attracted, staring intently at the moving performance. Everyone clapped hard and praised enthusiastically: "Great! These little guys are really great!"

　　"Do you know what the name of the little guy who dances with the most energy is?" A soldier, chewing on a blade of grass he had picked up, asked the soldier next to him.

　　"I don't know," the soldier replied indifferently.

　　"His name is Luo Renzhangzhu!"

　　"Ah! Is that the one you pulled from the river..."

　　"Yes, from the river..."

　　Nearly half a year had passed. At that time, the river had just thawed, and ice floes, like duckweed, were crowding and colliding with each other in the rapid current.

　　At this time, Luo Renzhangzhu and his elder sister came to the riverside to play.

　　"Look, the peach blossoms are blooming on the other side of the river!" Luo Renzhangzhu was very excited.

　　"Dare you go and pick two branches?" The elder sister was also very excited.

　　"Of course, I dare!"

　　No sooner said than done, Changzhu pulled the zip line on the rope bridge and slid to the other side of the river. Who knew that this zip line hadn't been used for a winter? When he slid to the middle of the river, he didn't know how it twisted around twice, Changzhu felt the sky spinning, the mountains spinning, and the rope spinning...

　　The elder sister screamed. A barefoot Tibetan woman ran over in a fluster. When she saw that only her younger daughter was left on the river beach, she was so frightened that she fell on the rocks! She cried, hoarsely calling her little son's name.

　　At this time, soldier Liu Youqing, carrying a bundle of firewood on his back, walked along the river beach, he walked very fast, he knew that the comrades in the cooking squad must be waiting anxiously. However, as soon as he heard the cries in the distance and saw a mass of black hair floating in the icy water, he froze. He threw down the firewood, threw off his military uniform, and jumped into the heart of the river, a new cluster of waves splashing in the heart of the river... He reached out and grabbed the child's arm, but the arm slipped off; he grabbed the corner of the child's clothes with all his might, but the corner of the clothes tore... Suddenly, a heavy piece of ice pushed him against a reef, and he blacked out and passed out...

　　He only passed out for a few seconds, and then he woke up from the cold. He saw a Tibetan woman about to jump into the river, and a Tibetan girl was holding her tightly, howling loudly... He was drawn into the waves for the second time, tightly grasping the child.

　　Was it the roar of the waves? Was it the enthusiastic applause? Liu Youqing was a little confused for a moment. He shook his head hard. Look, in the light of the lamps, by the fluttering curtain, wasn't the child still jumping and dancing? Jumping so brilliantly, dancing so movingly! Liu Youqing chewed on the bitter blade of grass, but his heart was filled with sweetness!

    甜蜜
    顾工
    草原上搭了一个戏台。台口前，摆着一长排酥油灯。一个金黄色的火苗连着一个金黄色的火苗，好像是一长串明亮的夜明珠。台上面，拉着红色的横幕，幕布上贴着藏、汉两族的文字：“慰问解放军晚会”。
    演员都是一些小学生：草原上的牧童，雅鲁藏布江边的背水姑娘，还有靠拾树枝、拾菌子过日子的娃子。可是谁也没想到他们的歌，竟唱得这样嘹喨；他们的舞，竟跳得这样齐整。有个八、九岁的孩子，头发蓬得像个小狮子，袖子甩得像条马尾巴，可是你看他的脚啊！看他的小皮鞋啊！“踢踢蹋蹋、蹋蹋踢踢……”发出多么铿锵有力的声音！
    解放军在台前，坐在一个个背包上面，一排排地很整齐。战士们被吸引住了，目不转睛地注视着那动人的表演。大家狠劲地鼓掌，大家热烈地赞叹：“真棒啊！这些小家伙可真棒！”
      “你知道跳得最有劲的那小家伙叫什么名字吗？”有一个战士咬着一根随手拔起来的草茎，问旁边的一个战士。
    “不知道。”那战士不介意地回答。
    “他叫罗仁昌珠！”
    “啊！就是你从河里……”
    “是的，从河里……”
    时间快过去大半年了。那时候河水刚刚解冻，冰块像是浮萍，在湍急的水流中，相互拥挤，相互冲撞。
    这时候，罗仁昌珠和他的小姐姐到水边来玩。
      “你看，河那边的桃花开了！”罗仁昌珠很兴奋。
      “你敢过去采两枝吗？”小姐姐也很兴奋。
      “当然敢！”
    说干就干，昌珠就拉过绳桥上的溜索，向河对岸滑去。谁知这溜索已经有一个冬天没有用过了，滑到河心的时候，不知怎么绕了两绕，昌珠感到天在转，山在转，绳子也在转……
    小姐姐尖声地叫起来。一个赤脚的藏族妇人，慌里慌张地跑来了。她一看，河滩上只剩下了小女儿，就吓得栽倒在乱石上啦！她哭泣着，嘶哑的叫着小儿子的名字。
    这时，战士刘有庆背着一捆柴，沿着河滩走来，他走得很快，他知道炊事班的同志一定等得很急。可是，他一听到远处的哭喊，一看到冰水中浮出的一团黑发，他僵住了。他把柴一抛，军衣一甩，跃进河心，河心中溅起一簇新的浪花……。他伸手抓了一下孩子的胳臂，胳臂滑脱了；他猛力抓了一下孩子的衣角，衣角又撕碎了……。突然，一块沉重的冰，把他顶到一块礁石上，他两眼一黑，晕了过去……
    只晕过去几秒钟，他又冷醒了。看见一位藏族妇女正要往河里跳，还有一个藏族姑娘死死地拉着她大声嚎……。他又第二次卷进波涛，紧紧地抓住了孩子。
    是波涛的喧响呢？是热烈的掌声呢？刘有庆一下子有点儿分不清了。他使劲摇了摇头。看，在灯火的照耀中，在飘动的幕布边，那孩子不是还在活蹦乱跳吗？蹦得多么出色，跳得多么动人！刘有庆咬着那根苦味的草茎，心里却充满了甜蜜！
