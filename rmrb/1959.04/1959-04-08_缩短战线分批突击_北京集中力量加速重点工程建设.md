Shorten the Front, Launch Attacks in Batches
Beijing Concentrates Forces to Accelerate Key Project Construction

(Our report) Beijing’s construction, installation, and municipal departments, along with a large number of factories undertaking equipment manufacturing tasks, are using the method of annihilating warfare, concentrating their forces to launch attacks on key projects such as the Beijing Turbine Generator Factory, the Beijing Steel Plant’s rolling mill workshop, the Shahe Iron Plant, and the Beijing Chemical Plant.

Half of the personnel of the Third Engineering Office of the Beijing Sixth Construction Engineering Company have been投入 invested in the finishing work of the Beijing Turbine Generator Factory’s civil engineering. Due to the concentration of forces, they overfulfilled their plan for March by 32%. Workers at the Beijing Chemical Plant construction site, through improving tools, reforming operating methods, and improving labor organization, simultaneously doubled the labor efficiency and output value of the entire construction site.

The equipment installation departments have also transferred elite and powerful teams. The First Division of the Municipal Industrial Installation Company concentrated more than 80% of its employees, investing them in the installation work of the Beijing Chemical Plant’s new polyvinyl chloride section. The Beijing Metal Structure Factory, under extremely heavy production tasks, transferred a lot of manpower and material resources to install the No. 2 100-cubic-meter blast furnace, hot blast stove, and other auxiliary equipment for the Shahe Iron Plant. In the work of installing the No. 2 blast furnace and hot blast stove for the Shahe Iron Plant, the Fourth Division of the Municipal Industrial Installation Company had no experience in blast furnace installation, so they went to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to learn from experience. When installing the blower, it was necessary to add a set of starting equipment, but the construction unit was unprepared and had no drawings. They collected spare parts from the inventory and manufactured the starting equipment, finally achieving success in the equipment. Moreover, the construction speed was very fast, from determining the need to add starting equipment to finding the equipment and installing it, it only took three days.

The municipal engineering units serving these new factories have completed more than 40,000 square meters of roads, 1.9 kilometers of water pipes, and 10.6 kilometers of sewers. In addition, a batch of projects are under construction or planned to start. In order to support the construction of the new polyvinyl chloride section of the Beijing Chemical Plant, the Beijing Municipal First Construction Company stopped some projects that could be suspended and concentrated its forces to construct this project. It has now completed the Great Leap Forward plan two days ahead of schedule.

The new factories need a large number of equipment, and come in a wide variety of types. The first phase of the new polyvinyl chloride section of the Beijing Chemical Plant alone requires more than 1,400 pieces of various standard and non-standard equipment. This factory has successively received strong support from 158 brother factories and mines from other places and the city. In order to attack the finishing work of equipment manufacturing, the Beijing Metal Structure Factory has launched mass-based high-yield competitions continuously for several months. From the fourth quarter of last year to the present, it has completed more than 1,000 finishing projects. At present, another production upsurge centered on high output, high quality, and high efficiency has been launched to ensure the needs of key projects.

### 缩短战线分批突击  北京集中力量加速重点工程建设

    缩短战线分批突击
    北京集中力量加速重点工程建设
    本报讯　北京市的土建、安装、市政各部门和承担设备制造任务的大批工厂，正在用打歼灭战的方法，集中力量突击建设北京汽轮发电机厂、北京钢厂轧钢车间、沙河铁厂、北京化工厂等重点工程。
    北京市第六建筑工程公司第三工程处有一半人投入了北京汽轮发电机厂的土建收尾工作，由于力量集中，3月份超额32％完成了计划。北京化工厂工地的工人，通过改进机具、改革操作方法和改善劳动组织，全工地劳动效率和产值同时翻番。
    设备安装部门也调出了精干的、强有力的队伍。市工业安装公司第一处集中了全处80％以上的职工，投入北京化工厂新建聚氯乙烯部分的安装工作。北京金属结构厂在生产任务十分繁重的情况下，抽调了很多人力、物力，为沙河铁厂安装了第二号一百立方公尺的高炉、热风炉和其它一些辅助设备。市工业安装公司四处在为沙河铁厂安装第二号高炉、热风炉等工作中，他们没有作过高炉安装工作，就到石钢去学习经验。安装鼓风机时，需要加装一套起动设备，但是建设单位没有准备，也没有图纸，他们就把库存的零件收集起来，制成了起动设备，终于在装备上获得了成功，而且施工速度非常快，从确定要加装起动设备到找设备、安装好，只用了三天时间。
    为这些新建工厂服务的市政工程单位，已经完成道路四万多平方公尺，引水管一点九公里，下水道十点六公里。此外，还有一批工程正在或计划开工。北京市市政一公司为了支援北京化工厂新建聚氯乙烯部分的工程，停了一些可以暂停的工程，集中力量为这个工程施工，现已提前两天完成了跃进计划。
    这些新建工厂需要的设备数量很大，种类繁多。仅北京化工厂新建聚氯乙烯部分的第一期工程，就需要各种标准和非标准设备一千四百余件。这个厂先后得到了外地和本市一百五十八个兄弟厂矿的有力支援。北京金属结构厂为了突击设备制造的扫尾工作，几个月来，发动群众连续组织高产竞赛，从去年第四季度到现在，已经结束了一千多项扫尾工程。目前，又掀起了一个以高产高质高效率为中心的赶制设备的生产高潮，以确保重点工程的需要。
