The natural world is truly wondrous. In Guangdong, a province with a mild climate, abundant rainfall, and evergreen seasons, there also exist vast sandy wastelands where flying sand obscures the sky. Bohe Town in Dianbai County was like this a few years ago. Surrounded by the sea on three sides, for thousands of years, yellow sand surged onto the land with the giant waves, and roaring sea winds swept the shifting sands, burying farmland and villages.

However, what was once a vast expanse of white sand has, after several years of transformation, become a lush green shelterbelt. The face of Bohe Town has changed, and the people live and work in peace. The change has been so rapid that even residents who had only recently left old Bohe Town could not believe their own eyes. When four fishermen, including Wang Yongqing, who had left their hometown five years ago, sailed near the port of Bohe, they suddenly hesitated, suspecting that they had taken the wrong route. They never dreamed that the boundless sandy wasteland along the coast could be transformed into a green Great Wall in just a few years. They even less expected that the creators of this green Great Wall were none other than the local fisherwomen under the education of the Party. Chen Jiao, a female Communist Party member, is one of the most outstanding of these women.

In the autumn of 1954, working groups from Zhanjiang Prefecture and Dianbai County were sent to survey the sandy wasteland and plan the construction of a shelterbelt to control the wind and sand. In this semi-fishing, semi-agricultural area, the men all went out to sea to fish, so the arduous task fell on the shoulders of the women. Because no one had ever seen trees grow on the beach, many people were skeptical about building a shelterbelt. Chen Jiao, like everyone else, was an ordinary housewife and had never thought that trees could grow on the beach. But she remembered that it was the Party that had liberated her from hunger, so she firmly believed that listening to the Party was the right thing to do. A strong belief that welled up from her heart supported her in this way.

She accepted the task assigned by the town Party committee to mobilize the masses to green the beach. She convened meetings with the women time and time again, but no one believed her. Wang Xiuying, the head of the women's group, had planted rubber trees in Hainan Island not long ago, and Chen Jiao happily went to discuss it with her: "The land for planting rubber is mud, not sand..." Xiuying also did not support her. She tried to persuade Xiuying again and again, but all attempts failed. Some people even satirized her for wanting to become a model worker. She was so angry that she fell on the bed and cried. "This is a pilot project for greening the coastal sandy wasteland. We must overcome difficulties and plant the trees well..." The words of the working group sent by the Party flooded into her mind again, illuminating her heart. The town Party secretary also helped her to summarize the reasons for her failure, and encouraged her to think of more ways to overcome difficulties and mobilize the women.

In order to understand Xiuying's true thoughts, Chen Jiao stayed at Xiuying's house and talked earnestly with her again and again. Remembering the disasters brought by the wind and sand in the past, Xiuying also cried. But the disagreement remained: could trees be planted on the beach, and would it be a futile effort? "If there is no mud on the beach, we will carry mud up there. If there is no water, we will water it every day. With a firm heart, even stones can be pierced. As long as we have the determination, we can do it..." Chen Jiao explained patiently to her. Their disagreements became less and less, and Xiuying's thinking slowly cleared.

Chen Jiao helped the women in this way unremittingly, and everyone's confidence in transforming the sandy beach gradually strengthened.

The Party branch decided to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, replace the soil in the tree pits with transported soil, and accelerate the growth of seedlings. At this time, it was a time of biting cold winds, and no one wanted to jump into the waist-deep ponds to dig mud. Chen Jiao did not hesitate to take off her cotton-padded clothes and take the lead in jumping in. Her actions deeply moved the women, and then, one after another, they scrambled to jump into the pond to dig mud. There were more than eight hundred of them, and they persisted for four consecutive days, accumulating more than 40,000 loads of fertilizer. The fishing port did not have manure baskets to hold the fertilizer, so Chen Jiao led the women to use their household water buckets to transport the fertilizer to the beach. The afforestation season came, but where to find planting tools? They were not intimidated by the difficulties. Some used their hands to dig sand and open tree pits. Chen Jiao felt that this was not a good way. She remembered that she had cooking utensils such as pot shovels and kitchen knives at home that could be used to dig sand and open tree pits, so she quickly went home and brought them out for everyone to use. The women were truly moved and unanimously brought their household cooking utensils to dig pits. In this way, the progress came faster. At that time, it was already the scorching summer, the sun was high in the sky, and the yellow sand was burning their feet, making it very difficult to walk. They put on wooden clogs and made a surprise attack to dig tree pits on the scorching beach. When the wind blew, the shifting sand hit their faces, flying into their mouths, ears, and noses. The women covered their mouths and noses with towels, squinted their eyes, and persisted in their work. Chen Jiao led more than six hundred women, step by step, overcame the face-to-face difficulties, and the first batch of more than three thousand casuarina seedlings were successfully planted.

Chen Jiao cherished the shelterbelt as if she cherished her own eyes. Once, a typhoon of magnitude eight struck the sea, and the yellow sand flew, covering the seedlings. Chen Jiao felt so sorry when she saw the green and lovely seedlings were buried by the shifting sand! She immediately went from house to house to mobilize the women to protect the seedlings. They opened the yellow sand one by one, carefully lifted the seedlings up; some of the seedlings were injured, so they supported them with bamboo branches; if the seedlings were damaged, they immediately replanted them.

After the seedlings were planted, they encountered a drought, and the seedlings began to turn yellow. Chen Jiao led the women to fight against the drought and protect the seedlings. Initially, water sources could be dug out on the beach, but the water became less and less, and the distance to carry water became longer and longer. Finally, they had to walk four miles to carry water. In this way, Chen Jiao led more than a thousand women to persist in fighting the drought for two months and saved the seedlings. Chen Jiao felt as if flowers were blooming in her heart when she saw the seedlings sprouting. She, Nanmu, and Aunt Lai Er almost greedily looked at the seedlings every day. They went to see them in the morning when they got up, and went to see them again after dinner, never getting tired of seeing them, and the more they looked, the happier they became. She thought to herself: After the shelterbelt grows up, the lives and production of the people in our Bohe Port will be guaranteed. The farmland will grow lush rice, sweet potatoes, and peanuts, and the fuel used by every household can also be solved. From then on, the desolate scene of a vast expanse of sandy wasteland will be gone forever!

Under the leadership of the Party, the heroic people of Bohe Port, with their own laboring hands, year after year, have created a shelterbelt that is 20.8 kilometers long and 150 meters to 280 meters wide, turning the beach into a beautiful oasis like emerald. The trees and grass that grow here are like countless chains, firmly holding the shifting sand and changing the face of nature! People walking in this green forest, if they observe carefully, will also find shifting sand that has been suppressed under the grass and dyed grayish-black. This is a sign that has been immersed in the sweat of heroic women.

    渔家女制服流沙博
    贺港植树造林的故事
    大自然就是这么奇异。在气候温和、雨量充沛、四季常青的广东，也有飞沙蔽日的茫茫沙荒。电白县博贺镇几年前就是这个样子。这里三面临海，千百年来，黄沙随巨浪涌向陆地，咆哮的海风卷着流沙埋没了农田和村庄。
    但是，原来一片白茫茫的沙滩，经过几年的改造，现在已经变成了一片青翠的防护林带。博贺镇的面貌改观了，群众也安居乐业了。它变化得如此迅速，连离别不久的老博贺镇的居民也不敢相信自己的眼睛了。当五年前离别家乡的王永清等四名渔民，开船驶近博贺港口的时候，他们突然迟疑起来，怀疑走错了航线。因为他们作梦也没想到，沿海一望无际的沙荒，几年内已变成一堵绿色的长城。他们更没有想到，缔造这片绿色长城的不是别人，而是在党教育下的本地渔民妇女。女共产党员陈娇，就是这些妇女中最出色的一个。
    1954年秋，湛江专区和电白县派来了工作组，勘察沙荒和规划营造防护林带，制服风沙。这个半渔半农地区，男的都出海捕鱼，艰巨任务就得落在妇女身上了。由于从没有人见过沙滩上生长树木，对营造防护林抱怀疑态度的人非常多。陈娇也像大伙一样，是个普通的家庭主妇，也从没想到过这沙滩能长树。但她想起把自己从饥饿中解放出来的是党，于是她坚定地相信：听党的话没错。一股从心里冒出的顽强信念就这样支持着她。
    她接受了镇党委交给的任务，发动群众绿化沙滩。她一次又一次召集妇女们开会，但没有人相信她。妇女组长王秀英不久前在海南岛种过橡胶，陈娇高兴地找她商量：“种橡胶的地是泥不是沙呀……”秀英也不支持她。她一次再次地想说服秀英，结果都失败了。有人还讽刺她是想当模范。她气得倒在床上哭了。“这里是绿化沿海沙荒的试点，一定要克服困难，把树种活种好……”党派来的工作组说过的话又涌进她的脑际，照亮了她的心。镇党委书记也帮助她总结失败的原因，鼓励她多想办法战胜困难，把妇女发动起来。
    为了了解秀英的真实思想。陈娇住到秀英家去，一次一次的恳切交谈，想起过去风沙带来的灾难，秀英也哭了。但分歧仍是沙滩上能不能种活树，会不会徒劳无功。“沙滩上没泥就挑泥上去，没水就天天浇水，心坚石就穿，只要有决心就成呀……”陈娇耐心地向她解释。她们的分歧越来越少，秀英的思想慢慢地通了。
    陈娇就这样不懈地帮助妇女们，大家对改造沙滩的信心渐渐地坚定起来了。
    党支部决定大量积肥，将树穴换上客土，加速幼苗长生。这时，正是寒风袭人的天气，谁也不愿跳下齐腰深的水塘去挖泥。陈娇毫不犹疑地脱下棉衣，第一个带头跳下去。她的行动深深地感动了妇女们，接着，一个一个争先恐后地跳下水塘去挖泥了。她们共有八百多人，一连坚持了四天，共积下四万多担肥料。渔港没有粪箕来装肥，陈娇带动妇女们用家里担水的水桶，将肥料运到沙滩去。造林季节到来了，可是那里去弄植树工具呢？她们没有被困难吓倒，有的就用手挖沙、开树穴。陈娇觉得这样干不是办法，她想起家里有锅铲、菜刀等炊具，可用来挖沙、开树穴，就迅速回家拿出来，让大家使用。妇女们着实感动了，不约而同地将家里的炊具也拿来挖穴。这样，进度来得更快了。那时，已经到了酷热的夏天，太阳当空，黄沙烫脚，走起路来非常困难，她们就穿上木屐，在炽热的沙滩上突击挖树穴。刮起大风，流沙迎面扑来，飞进他们的口、耳、鼻子里去，妇女们就用手巾包着口鼻，眯着眼睛，坚持工作。陈娇带动着六百多名妇女，一步一步的克服了面对面的困难，第一批三千多株木麻黄幼苗就胜利地种下了。
    陈娇爱护林带就好像爱护她自己的眼睛一样。有一次，海面刮起了八级台风，黄沙飞扬，掩盖了树苗。陈娇看见青绿可爱的幼苗被流沙埋没了，心里可疼啦！她立即挨家挨户的发动妇女去护苗，她们逐株扒开黄沙，把树苗小心地扶起来；有的树苗受了伤，就用竹枝撑起来；树苗坏了，就立即补种上。
    树苗种下以后又碰到天旱，眼看幼苗开始枯黄了。陈娇带动妇女们向旱患作斗争，保护幼苗。最初从沙滩上可以挖出水源，但水越来越少了，担水的距离也越来越远了，最后要走到四华里远的地方去担水。就这样，陈娇带动着一千多名妇女坚持抗旱二个月，把树苗保住了。陈娇看到树苗发芽，心里就好像开了花。她和南姆、赖二婶差不多天天都贪婪地看树苗，早上起床去看，晚饭后又走去看，百看不厌，越看心里越高兴。她心里想：林带长大后，我们博贺港人民的生活和生产就有保障了。农田长上茂盛的稻子、番薯和花生，每家每户用的燃料也可解决了。从此，白茫茫的一片沙荒景象，一去不复返了！
    英雄的博贺港人民，在党领导下，用自己劳动的双手，一年又一年地营造了一条长二十点八公里，宽一百五十公尺至二百八十公尺的防护林带，把沙滩绣成翡翠般美丽的绿洲。这里长起的树木和青草，就像无数条链子，把流沙牵得牢牢的，改变了自然面貌！在这个绿林中漫步的人们，如果仔细的观察，还会发现压服在青草底下染上灰黑色的流沙，这是受过英雄的妇女们汗水浸润的标志。
