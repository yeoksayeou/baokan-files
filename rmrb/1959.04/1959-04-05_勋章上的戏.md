    The Drama on the Medal
    Su Hang
    In a film, if image-rich details can be arranged at crucial moments, it can avoid lengthy dialogues and make the film "have drama." Recently, after watching the Soviet color film "The Glory of the Baltic," I felt that a detail was handled in a way that truly added color to the entire drama. This is the French "Legion of Honour" medal of the protagonist, Liutov.
    It appears on the screen many times, each time different, each time artistically reflecting Liutov's different states of mind, almost running through Liutov's entire ideological transformation process. At first, we see him overjoyed at being able to receive the French "Legion of Honour" medal, regarding it as a treasure and proudly hanging it on his chest. This vividly reflects Liutov's inability to immediately recognize the situation and distinguish between friend and foe, his trusting attitude towards the bourgeoisie, and his unwillingness to participate in the revolutionary activities of the "Thunderer" sailors. Then we see him wearing it proudly walking on the streets of Petrograd, being ridiculed by a group of anarchists, and he desperately tries to snatch the medal back, while the "Thunderer" sailors rescue him. He takes the "medal" and goes to listen to Lenin's speech. On the screen appears an ocean of masses wearing white sailor uniforms, but Liutov's blue sailor uniform is the most conspicuous. No, the most conspicuous is the medal he wears on his chest and the reflection of Liutov's thoughts. After listening to Lenin's speech, he excitedly says, "Great, brothers, so that's how it is, I understand now!" This sentence shows that the spark of truth has begun to flicker in his mind, but that medal tells us that he has not fully recognized the truth – he still wears it when he goes to see the commander of the "Thunderer." He goes to the Party's secret printing house to say goodbye to the revolutionary young woman Liuxia. When he learns that they lack funds, we see a hand reaching into the frame and putting the medal into a hat, followed by Liutov's smiling, excited face. The French "medal" finally leaves Liutov, and Liutov firmly embarks on the revolutionary road, returning to his own warship.
    Look, how much drama has an ordinary medal brought to the film here! Due to the artist's careful arrangement, they summarize the extremely rich and complex psychological state of the characters, isn't it more informative and clearer than thousands of words of dialogue?

    勋章上的戏
    苏杭
    在一部影片里，如果能把富于形象性的细节安排在节骨眼上，既可避免冗长的对话，又可使电影“有戏”。最近看过苏联采色片“波罗的海的光荣”，觉得有个细节，处理得真是给整个戏添色不少。这就是主人公留托夫那颗法国“荣誉勋章”。
    它在银幕上多次出现，一次和一次不同，每次都富于艺术魅力地反映出水兵留托夫不同的思想状态，几乎贯串了留托夫的全部思想转变过程。最初我们看到他为了能去领取法国“荣誉勋章”而高兴得手舞足蹈，视为珍宝，骄傲地挂在胸前。这形象地反映出留托夫还不能马上认清形势和分清敌友，对资产阶级还采取轻信态度而不愿参加“霹雷号”水兵们革命活动的心理活动。继而我们看到他戴着它高傲地在彼得格勒大街上行走时，受到一群无政府主义者的嘲弄，勋章被抢走，他愤不顾身地往回抢，而“霹雷号”水兵解救了他，他把“勋章”带好去听列宁讲话。银幕上出现海洋一般穿着白色水兵服的群众，唯独留托夫的兰色水兵服最刺眼，不，最刺眼的还是他胸前配戴的勋章和它所反映的留托夫的思想面貌。听过列宁讲话之后，他激动地说：“好哇，弟兄们，原来是这样，这我算明白了！”这句话说明真理的火花开始在他的思想里闪灼，但是那枚勋章告诉我们，他还没有完全认识真理——他去见“霹雷号”的指挥官时还是戴着它。他到党的秘密印刷所去和革命女青年留霞告别，当他知道他们缺乏资金时，我们看到一支手伸入镜头把那颗勋章放入帽子里，紧接着出现留托夫微笑、激动的脸孔。法国“勋章”终于离开了留托夫，留托夫坚定地走上革命的道路，重新回到自己的军舰上去了。
    请看，一个普通的勋章在这里给影片带来了多少的戏！由于艺术家的精心安排，它们概括了人物极其丰富复杂的心理状态，不是要比千百句对话还能说明更多的东西，而且说明得更加鲜明有力吗？
