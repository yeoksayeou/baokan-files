Unveiling the Secrets of the Soil
Commentator of this newspaper

    A mass soil survey and identification effort, closely integrated with production, is underway nationwide. The main task of this work is to unveil the secrets of the soil, understand its details, further rationally arrange production, formulate various agricultural production increase measures, and promote agricultural production.

    Agricultural production increase is the result of the mutual combination and promotion of various factors. We emphasize that the "Eight-Character Charter" of agricultural production must be fully implemented, and this is the reason. "Soil" is the foundation of agricultural production. Correctly understanding it, improving it, and utilizing it is of great importance to agricultural production increase. However, soil is by no means isolated. The reasons for the formation of good or bad soil are complex, and it is intertwined and interacts with various factors such as geographical environment, geology, hydrology, irrigation, fertilization, and cultivation methods. Therefore, when conducting a soil survey, it is necessary to study the problems of the soil itself, as well as various factors related to the soil. In this way, we can find out, based on facts, the various practical problems existing in the current production of a piece of land, a plot of land, and even a commune or a region, prescribe the right medicine, and propose effective measures for increasing production.

    Soil surveys are also needed to comprehensively develop various economies such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Only after understanding the soil characteristics of various places can we arrange production according to local conditions and make the best use of the land. Through soil surveys, the Kaifeng Special District in Henan Province has planned five food crop zones, sixteen cash crop zones, six large forest belts, one hundred and thirty-three fruit tree zones, and forty fishing zones. At the same time, fertile land was selected as high-yield plots. This lays the foundation for better and more comprehensive development of production in the future.

    Clarifying the details of the soil and measuring the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content of the soil can also scientifically formulate fertilization plans according to the different requirements of various crops, which is conducive to rational fertilization. Combined with soil surveys, a large number of fertilizer sources can also be found. Guangdong Province has discovered more than 700 million dan of peat and more than 100 kinds of wild green manure. Jiangsu Province has discovered more than 200 million tons of peat. Other provinces have also discovered many fertilizer sources, which provides a reliable material basis for the leap forward in agricultural production.

    Soil survey work must be carried out around the central task of current production. Starting from production and settling down in production, and closely combining it with production, it will be lively and popular with the masses. Areas that are preparing for spring sowing can consider the layout of crops according to soil conditions, so that stubble rotation is appropriate, indicators and measures are correct, and spring sowing can be carried out better. Clarifying the details of the soil can also make field management of summer harvest crops more scientific. For example, Jiangjin Special District in Sichuan Province, according to the fertility characteristics of different soils, checks seedling color, density, root development, and tillering; conducts field consultations from seedlings to soil, and from soil to seedlings, and "prescribes prescriptions" for production, proposing management measures such as fertilization and irrigation. Therefore, the soil survey team is also a production inspection team and a crop medical team, which is very popular among the majority of farmers. They said: In the past, we farmed blindly, but now we are prescribing the right medicine to promote production, and we are sure that production will be more guaranteed in the future.

  In the long-term production practice, the broad masses of farmers in our country share the fate and breathe with the land, thoroughly understanding the "temperament" of the cultivated land soil, and accumulating extremely rich experience, but it is not systematic enough, knowing what it is but not knowing why. In the entire process of soil survey, it is necessary to conscientiously follow the mass line. Only by mobilizing the masses to participate in the survey work, and learning from the masses with an open mind in the work, deeply and carefully summarizing the experience of the masses, and systematizing the experience of the masses under the guidance of correct theory, can we do a good job in soil survey.

    In order to continuously improve soil fertility and increase production, we must effectively apply the results of soil survey and identification to production, so that it can blossom and bear fruit. At present, areas that have completed or basically completed the survey are further carrying out soil improvement campaigns. Through survey and identification, Zhejiang Province has prescribed the right medicine according to soil conditions and has improved more than 800,000 mu of soil. Many people's communes in various regions have selected several major soils and established field archives. Some people's communes have also established simple soil testing laboratories to regularly test the soil fertility. Obviously, adopting various methods, closely combining with production needs, and carrying out mass soil scientific research activities can enable soil science to take root among the masses. This will not only accelerate the increase in agricultural output, but also make my country's agricultural soil science shine brightly.

　　揭开土壤的秘密
　　本报评论员
    密切结合生产的群众性的土壤普查鉴定工作，正在全国范围内进行着。这项工作的主要任务，是揭开土壤秘密，摸清土壤底细，进一步合理地安排生产，制定各项农业增产措施，促进农业生产。
    农业增产，是多种因素互相结合互相促进的结果。我们强调农业生产的“八字宪法”必须全面贯彻执行，就是这个道理。“土”是农业生产的基础。正确地认识它，改良它和利用它，对于农业增产关系极大。但是，土壤也决不是孤立的。形成土壤好与不好的原因是复杂的，它和地理环境、地质、水文、灌溉、施肥、耕作方法等各方面因素都互有牵连，互相影响。因此，在进行土壤普查的时候，要研究土壤本身的问题，也要研究与土壤有关的各种因素，这样就可以把一块地、一片地、进而到一个公社、一个地区在目前生产上存在的各种实际问题有根据地找出来，对症下药，为增产提出有效的措施。
    为了全面地发展农、林、牧、副、渔等多种经济，也需要土壤普查。了解了各地的土壤特性之后，才能因地制宜安排生产，做到地尽其利。河南开封专区通过土壤普查，规划了五个粮食作物区，十六个经济作物区，六条大型林带，一百三十三个果树区和四十个渔区。同时选定了肥沃的土地作为丰产方。这就为今后更好地全面发展生产奠定了基础。
    摸清土壤底细，测定土壤的氮、磷、钾含量，还可以根据各种作物的不同要求，科学地制定施肥计划，有利于合理施肥。结合土壤普查，还可以查出大量肥源。广东省就发现泥炭七亿多担，野生绿肥一百多种。江苏省查出泥炭二亿多吨。其他各省发现的肥源也很多，这就为农业生产跃进，提供了可靠的物质基础。
    土壤普查工作，必须围绕当前生产中心任务进行。从生产入手，又落脚于生产，把它和生产紧密结合起来，这样就会搞得有声有色，深受群众欢迎。正在准备春播的地区，可以根据土壤条件考虑作物的布局，作到茬口合适，指标和措施对头，能使春播进行得更好。摸清土壤底细，也能更科学地作好夏收作物的田间管理。例如四川省江津专区根据不同土壤的肥力特性，查苗色，查密植程度，查根系发育状况，查分蘖；由苗到土，由土到苗，进行田间会诊，为生产“开药方”，提出施肥、灌溉等管理措施。因此土壤普查队，又是生产检查队，也是庄稼医疗队，很受广大农民的欢迎。他们说：过去是睁眼瞎子种田，现在是对症下药促进生产，今后增产一定更有保证。
  我国广大农民群众在长期的生产实践中，与土地共命运，同呼吸，摸透了耕地土壤的“脾气”，积累了极其丰富的经验，只不过还不够系统，知其然而不知其所以然。在进行土壤普查的全部过程中，要认真地走群众路线。只有发动群众，参加普查工作，并在工作中虚心向群众学习，深入、细致地总结群众经验，在正确的理论指导下把群众的经验加以系统化，提高一步，才能把土壤普查工作做好。
    为了不断提高土壤肥力，增加生产，必须把土壤普查鉴定成果，切实运用到生产中去，使它开花结果。目前已完成或基本完成普查的地区，都在进一步开展改良土壤运动。浙江省通过普查鉴定，针对土壤情况对症下药，已改良土壤八十余万亩。许多地区的人民公社选定几种主要土壤，建立田间档案。有的人民公社还建立了简易的土壤化验室，定期测验土壤肥力的状况。显然，采用多种方式，紧密结合生产需要，开展群众性的土壤科学研究活动，就能使土壤科学回到群众中生根落脚。这就不仅可以加速提高农业产量，而且也将使我国农业土壤科学大放异彩。
