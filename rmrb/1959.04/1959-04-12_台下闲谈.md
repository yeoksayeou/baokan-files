　　Offstage Musings
　　Lin Yu
　　I don’t have many hobbies, but I love watching plays. Whenever there's a new play being staged or a new troupe from out of town arrives, I always try to see it if I can. While watching, I casually discuss it with a few comrades. These are just casual conversations, nothing of great importance. Sometimes, after the play ends and I return home, if my enthusiasm hasn't waned, I'll jot down these conversations in my diary for myself to read, and sometimes I'll show them to other comrades. Recently, seeing the lively activity of theater reviews in the newspapers, I've also copied a few and sent them in to join the fun.

　　The Death Token (Performed by the China Peking Opera Theater)
　　"The Death Token" is a good play. I once saw the Hunan Shaoyang Flower Drum Opera version, and this performance by the Peking Opera Theater is a great improvement. The play is much more complete, and the singing and acting skills are displayed very smoothly. The playwright's arrangement shows great skill, and the director also has unique insights in the overall layout and rhythm of the play. Comrade Li Hezeng's long solo when considering how to save Wang Yuhuan is very brilliant.

　　But there are still some shortcomings I feel: The main one is that the characters' personalities are not prominent enough. A play like "The Death Token," which is both clean and captivating, doesn't leave a deep impression on the audience's minds because the three female characters each lack distinct personalities. I think that these three, due to their different backgrounds, lives, and positions, could be portrayed with different, contrasting, and distinct personalities, adding much color to the play. If the director uses contrasting personalities as a means, and the actors delve deeper into the roles to embody distinct personalities, then further processing and creation in this direction would not only make the play captivating in the theater but also give people a lasting and unforgettable experience.

　　Here are a few more minor suggestions: First, Wang Yuhuan's long solo when she first appears seems to require a lot of effort but doesn't have much effect, and it also hinders the effect of her singing later on. Second, it seems unnecessary for the Hengyang garrison commander to be rude to the magistrate as soon as he arrives at the county yamen. It would be more dramatic if the magistrate unexpectedly didn't side with him but instead tried to handle the case impartially, and then the commander lost his temper.

　　Peking Opera used to be not only a refined art but also an art that expressed distinct and strong personalities, but it has gradually lost its strong appeal in this aspect. Recently, Peking Opera has returned to a new stage of abundant creativity. If more attention can also be paid to characterization, the success will be even greater.

　　Chen Sanliang's Trial
　　(Performed by the Anyang Henan Yu Opera Theater)
　　This is a unique traditional Yu Opera piece, a good one. Chen Sanliang sold herself into prostitution to bury her parents and raise her younger brother. Because she was talented and learned, an article of hers could sell for three taels of silver, hence the name Chen Sanliang. Her parents were killed by corrupt officials, so she hated corrupt practices very much. But when she was once involved in a lawsuit, she fell into the hands of a corrupt official; and this official happened to be her younger brother, whom she hadn't seen for many years. This is, of course, a legendary plot, but the playwright didn't set such a plot or choose such a plot without a purpose. It was to use Chen Sanliang's mouth to scold corrupt officials heartily. When her brother had already discovered that the prostitute in the hall was his own sister and knelt down to recognize her, Chen Sanliang said, "I do have a brother who is an official, but unfortunately, millions of ordinary people don't have brothers who are officials, and they deserve to be wronged to death" (roughly). She said many heartfelt and sharp words, actually scolding all the corrupt officials thoroughly.

　　The script expresses this hatred for corrupt officials, which undoubtedly comes from the hand of a folk writer who has experienced this pain. This hatred is indeed not ordinary, but strong and profound. When her other adopted brother, Chen Kui, whom she personally cultivated and educated, later became a top scholar and came to save her and kneel before her, she insisted on asking clearly, "Are you the Chen Kui of the past or the Chen Kui of the present?" Only after he said that he was the Chen Kui of the past did she accept his bow. She also talked about why she didn't hire a teacher to coach him but had to teach him herself, because everyone taught by teachers would be corrupt after becoming officials. This shows the depth of the author's grief and indignation.

　　China has a tradition of writing plays to express the author's sense of injustice, and this play is probably one of them. But the valuable thing about this play is that what is written is not personal grievances but the public outrage of the people. The author embodies this anger into a prostitute Chen Sanliang who is rebellious, has a clear sense of right and wrong, has ardent love and hate, and has a steely backbone, making people unable to forget this character after watching the play.

　　Comrade Cui Lantian meticulously portrays the character of Chen Sanliang, especially in terms of singing, which is very vivid and insightful. But in terms of the whole play, it can be artistically processed to make it more complete. The actor playing the innkeeper is old and experienced, and the actor playing the younger brother Li Mingfeng can greatly improve his characterization. If the younger brother's role is also equally prominent, and matched well with the elder sister, the play will be more lively, sharper, and more profound.

### 台下闲谈

　　台下闲谈
　　林羽
    我没有多少嗜好，就爱看戏。每当有什么新戏上演或是有什么外地的新剧团来了，只要有可能，我总得设法去见识见识。一边看，一边和几个同志随意议论议论。这些话只是闲谈，无关宏旨。有时散戏回家之后，兴致还没有尽，就把这些闲谈记在日记本上自己看看，有时也给别的同志看看。最近看到报纸上戏剧评论很活跃，也抄几则寄去，凑凑热闹。
　　生死牌（中国京剧院演出）
    生死牌是个好戏，我曾看过湖南邵阳花鼓戏的演出，这回京剧院的演出是大大提高了。戏完整多了，唱做的工夫也发挥得很酣畅了。编剧的安排很见功夫，导演在戏的整个布局和节奏的运用上也有独到之处。李和曾同志在筹思要救王玉环的一长段独唱非常精采。
    也仍有些感到不足之处：最主要的是感到人物的性格不突出。一个戏，像生死牌这样的，既干净，又很抓人，但由于三个女角色各自性格不太鲜明，就不容易在观众脑子里留下深刻的印象。我想，她们三人由于身世、生活和所处地位的不同，是可以演出不同的，互相对比的鲜明性格来，给戏增加许多色彩的。导演运用性格的对比作为手段，演员为了深入挖掘角色而体现出鲜明的性格来，从这方面再去加工创作，戏就不止于在剧场里面抓人，而且会给人经久难忘的感受。
    还有几点零碎意见：一是王玉环上来就来长段唱，似乎费了力而效果不大，而且妨碍了她在后面唱的效果。再则是衡阳总兵初到县衙就对知县耍态度似乎不必要，如果在县官居然不向着他而想秉公断案，使他大出意外，然后才发起脾气来，才更有戏可做。
    京剧曾经不止是洗炼的艺术，而且是一种表现性格鲜明强烈的艺术，但后来在这方面渐渐失去强烈的感染力。最近京剧又回复到创造充沛的新阶段来了，如能在性格化方面也多多注意，则成功必更大。
    陈三两爬堂
    （河南安阳豫剧院演出）
    这是一个豫剧独有的传统剧目，一个好剧目。陈三两为了葬亲养弟，卖身为妓女。因为才学好，一篇文章能卖三两银子，故名陈三两。她的父母是贪官害死的，她因此非常恨贪赃的行为。但是当她一次吃官司的时候，却又落在贪官手里；而这个官恰是她多年不见的弟弟。这当然是个传奇的情节，但剧作者之所以设定这样一个情节或选择了这样一个情节却不是没有用意的，他是为了借陈三两之口来痛痛快快地骂贪官污吏。当弟弟已经发现堂下的妓女就是亲姐姐而跪下来认她的时候，陈三两却说，我倒是有你这么一个弟弟，可惜千千万万的老百姓没有做官的弟弟，他们活该冤死了（大意）。她说了许多痛快而尖锐的话，实际上把一切的贪官骂了个痛快。
    剧本表现了这种对于贪官污吏的痛恨，无可怀疑地是出自一位体验过这种痛苦的民间作家之手。这种痛恨的确不是一般的，而是强烈的和深刻的。当她的另一个义弟，她亲手培养和教育出来，后来中了状元的陈奎来救她并且向她跪拜的时候，她却坚持要问清楚：“你是从前的陈奎还是现在的陈奎？”直到他说是从前的陈奎之后，这才受他一拜。她还谈到为什么不请一位先生来教练，却要亲自教他，因为一切教书先生教出来的人当官后无不贪污。足见作者悲愤之深了。
    中国有一种借写戏的方式来写作者胸中不平之气的传统，这个戏恐怕也是其中之一。但这个戏之可贵处在于所写的不是个人私愤，而是人民的公愤。作者把这一腔的愤怒形象化为一个有反抗性、有明确的是非、有热烈的爱憎、有钢硬的骨头的妓女陈三两，使人看完戏之后忘不了这个人物。
    崔兰田同志很细致地刻划了陈三两这个人物，在唱方面尤其能传神入微。但从整个戏来说，还可以在艺术上加工使之更加完整一些。演店家的演员很老，是个有经验的演员，演亲弟弟李鸣凤的演员还可以在人物的刻划上大大加工。如果弟弟的戏也同样突出，和姐姐门当户对，戏就更热闹、更尖锐，也就更深刻了。
