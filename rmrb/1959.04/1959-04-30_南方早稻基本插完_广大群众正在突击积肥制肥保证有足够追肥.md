(Our dispatch) The high tide of early rice transplanting is gradually moving north. At present, the early rice in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan and other southern provinces (regions) is about to be completely transplanted, and some have already been completed. Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces have entered the busy stage of transplanting, and transplanting work has also begun successively in various parts of the Yangtze River Basin.

The widespread implementation of rational close planting is a significant feature of this year's early rice transplanting. In order to ensure the rationality of close planting, many people's communes in various regions have extensively mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of increased production from close planting last year before transplanting. Based on soil quality, plowing depth, fertilization, water conservancy, early rice varieties, labor availability, and conditions and requirements such as facilitating ventilation and light transmission, they have formulated close planting specifications in accordance with local conditions. In Guangdong, the number of holes per mu is generally doubled compared to last year, according to the close planting specifications. According to key inspections in various parts of Hunan Province, the early rice that has been transplanted has 30,000 to 40,000 holes per mu, which is nearly double the amount of last year. The Gantangwan Production Brigade of Liyuan Commune in Yizhang County implemented close planting of 3x5, 3x6, and 3x7 according to the specific conditions of each paddy field. The commune members generally praised this, believing that it took into account the soil fertility and was easy to walk through for inter-tillage and weeding.

This year, the planting area of early japonica rice in various parts of the South is larger than in any previous year. Japonica rice tastes better than indica rice, and the yield is not lower than indica rice. This type of rice is more cold-resistant and can be sown and transplanted earlier. Therefore, on the basis of past trials and gradual promotion, various regions have further expanded the planting area this year. According to statistics from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, the planting area of early japonica rice has reached about 13 million mu. In Jiangsu Province, the area of early japonica rice accounted for only 38% of the early rice area last year, but this year it will increase to more than 70%.

In order to allow rice to mature earlier and to regulate labor in a planned way, the direct seeding area of early rice has also been expanded this year. According to incomplete statistics from Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces, about 9 million mu of early rice have been directly seeded. After emergence, the directly seeded early rice in Longxi County, Fujian Province, immediately strengthened field management. After five days of hard work by 10,000 people, the work of thinning, replanting, inter-tillage and weeding has been completed.

"Seizing the season means seizing a bumper harvest." In order to ensure that the early rice raised for transplanting is transplanted in a timely manner, that the directly seeded early rice is sown at the right time, and to adapt to the new situation of requiring more labor for rational close planting, various regions adjusted their labor force and strengthened the front line of early rice production long before the early rice transplanting and sowing. Guangdong Province drew a large number of laborers from eight aspects, including water conservancy construction sites, logistics departments, land reclamation professional teams, and sideline production teams, and put them into the transplanting battle. In the transplanting process, in order to speed up the progress and ensure the close planting specifications, many regions have launched transplanting competitions.

This year's early rice transplanting and sowing were carried out on the basis of doing a good job in preparatory work. According to inspections in various places, most early rice fields were plowed two to four inches deeper than last year, and the amount of base fertilizer applied per mu was also one to two times more than last year. At present, many areas that have basically completed early rice transplanting are carrying out a mass campaign of concentrated fertilizer accumulation and production while focusing on early field management, preparing a large amount of top dressing for early rice to ensure that the seedlings are well-fed.

    南方早稻基本插完
    广大群众正在突击积肥制肥保证有足够追肥
    本报讯　早稻插秧高潮正在逐渐北移。目前，南方广东、广西、福建、贵州、云南、湖南等省（区）的早稻即将插完；有的已经插完；江西、浙江等省已经进入了插秧大忙阶段，长江流域各地插秧工作也已陆续开始。
    普遍推行合理密植，是今年早稻插秧中的显著特点。为了保证密植合理，很多地区的人民公社在插秧之前，都广泛发动群众总结了去年密植的增产经验，根据土质、耕深、施肥、水利、早稻品种和劳力多少以及便于通风透光等条件和要求，因地制宜地定出了密植的规格。广东各地根据密植规格，一般每亩穴数比去年增加一倍左右。湖南省据各地重点检查，已经插下的早稻每亩有三万穴到四万穴，比去年增加了将近一倍。宜章县栗源公社甘棠湾生产大队根据各块稻田的具体条件，实行3×5、3×6，3×7的密植后，社员普遍说好，认为既照顾了土质肥瘦，又进得去脚，便于中耕除草。
    今年南方各地早粳稻的种植面积比以往任何一年都多。粳稻比籼稻好吃，产量又不比籼稻低；这种水稻耐寒力强，可以提早播种育秧和插秧，因此，各地在过去试种和逐步推广的基础上，今年进一步扩大了种植面积。据江苏、浙江、福建、广东四省统计，今年早粳稻种植面积共达一千三百万亩左右。江苏省去年早粳稻面积仅占早稻面积38％，今年将增加到70％以上。
    为了使水稻提早成熟和有计划的调节劳力，今年早稻直播面积也扩大了。据广东、广西、福建、江西、浙江五省不完全统计，目前已直播早稻九百万亩左右。福建省龙溪县的直播早稻，在出苗以后，立即加强了田间管理，经过一万人的五天奋战，已经做好了间苗、补苗、中耕除草等工作。
    “抢季节就是抢丰收”，为了保证育秧移栽的早稻及时插秧，直播的早稻适时下种，和适应实行合理密植需要劳力较多的新形势，各地早在早稻插秧、播种以前，就调整了劳力加强早稻生产第一线。广东省从水利工地、后勤部门，开荒专业队、副业生产队等八个方面抽调了大批劳力投入插秧战斗。在插秧中，为了加快进度和保证密植规格，很多地区开展了插秧竞赛。
    今年的早稻插秧和播种，是在做好备耕工作的基础上展开的。据各地检查，绝大部分早稻田都比去年深耕二寸到四寸，每亩施底肥的数量也比去年增加了一倍到二倍以上。目前不少已经基本结束早稻插秧的地区，在早抓田间管理的同时，正在开展群众性的突击积肥造肥运动，为早稻准备大量追肥，保证禾苗吃饱。
