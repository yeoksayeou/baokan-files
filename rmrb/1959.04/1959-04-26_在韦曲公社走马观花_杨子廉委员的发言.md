Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, as well as the report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

Recently, I took a brief, whirlwind tour of the Weiqu Commune in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province. I would now like to share some of my observations based on what I learned.

	The living standards of the commune members have been greatly improved, exceeding the level of local prosperous middle peasants.

In 1958, Chang'an County's average grain yield was over 500 jin per mu, an increase of 60% compared to 1957. The Weiqu Commune, which I inspected, was formed by merging 34 original advanced cooperatives. It has over 6,000 households and more than 31,000 people, with 62,000 mu of cultivated land, including 6,000 mu for vegetables and 56,000 mu for grain. The total grain output in 1958 was over 27.7 million jin, an increase of 94% compared to 1957, and an increase of 40% compared to 1956, a year of great harvest in Guanzhong. The average grain per person was close to 900 jin, achieving the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The Jiangjia Village Production Team (23 households, 135 people) of this commune made particularly outstanding progress in 1958: The village's grain field area was 136.5 mu, accounting for 66.5% of the cultivated land area, of which 101 mu were summer fields, with an average yield of 284 jin per mu, including 60.8 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 396.5 jin per mu; 115 mu were autumn fields, with an average yield of 944 jin per mu, including 29 mu of rice, with an average yield of 892 jin per mu, and 2 mu of high-yield rice, with an average yield of 1,083 jin per mu; 85.5 mu of corn, with an average yield of 1,050 jin per mu, and 2 mu of high-yield corn, with an average yield of 1,200 jin per mu. The total grain output for the year was 137,284 jin, with an average yield of 1,005 jin and 12 liang per mu, an increase of 255.6% compared to the yield of 285.5 jin per mu in 1957; cotton yield was 90 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 2.6 times compared to the yield of 25 jin per mu in 1957. The village has a large area of economic crops, accounting for 35.4% of the cultivated land area. It has always been a grain-deficient team, and public grain has always been paid with loans. Every year after the Spring Festival, the food supply relied on the state. However, the situation in 1958 was very different. In addition to paying public grain, the grain was not only self-sufficient, but also sold surplus grain. The lives of the commune members have been greatly improved, exceeding the living standards of the local prosperous middle peasants.

	Wheat is growing vigorously, a sea of green. Farmers are conducting scientific research.

The winter wheat sowing in 1958 was generally done very well. Their slogans were: no deep plowing, no planting; no planting on barren land; no planting if the land is not well prepared; no planting without close planting. Deep plowing was all done at a depth of one foot or more, with 10,000 to 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and generally about 30 jin of seeds sown per mu, earnestly implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. At present, the wheat seedlings are a sea of green, growing vigorously. There are generally 700,000 to 800,000 plants per mu, and more than one million plants in high-yield fields. The masses are working with soaring enthusiasm to prevent lodging, apply topdressing fertilizer, irrigate, and prevent pests. They are full of confidence and strong will, and are striving to achieve 1,500 jin of wheat per mu on average, making one season equal to one year. "Cover the sky and cover the earth for a hundred days, guard the six gates of wheat, dig and hoe thoroughly, win the top prize on the bumper harvest list." This is the poem of the farmers praising their heroic spirit.

Farmers have also begun scientific research work. I visited the experimental field for cultivating improved wheat varieties organized by the Weiqu Commune, where 273 different varieties of wheat were planted, including comparative experiments of improved varieties, observation experiments, planting method experiments, and seed quantity experiments. These things, which were previously considered to be the business of agricultural experts, are now being organized by the farmers themselves.

	Building canals on the plateau with water brought from above. Developing industry increases income.

The water conservancy work in this county also saw an outstanding leap forward in 1958. The newly built canals in one year expanded the irrigation area to 400,000 mu, equal to 75.4% of the existing 530,000 mu of irrigated land. Moreover, the canals are mainly plateau canals. The famous Shaolingyuan, Shenheyuan, as well as other Waquan Yuan, Fujia Yuan, and Mingdu Yuan, are all loess plateaus dozens to hundreds of meters high. For thousands of years, they have been relying on the sky for food. However, in 1958, the river water from the Qinling Mountains was all diverted to the top of the plateaus, and nature is undergoing a fundamental change. According to the statistics of four canals, the trunk canals alone are more than 60 kilometers long, with 1.745 million cubic meters of earth and stone, and more than 400 large and small structures. Such a large project was basically completed in just a few months thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the masses. Moreover, it cost very little, with the state only investing more than 100,000 yuan. The masses call the canal "Happiness Canal," saying, "Things that we never dared to think about in the past have been done today under the leadership of the Communist Party."

The commune has also established many industrial enterprises. Among them, the county-run steel plant has formed the scale of a joint steel enterprise on the basis of the mass movement to run steel in the entire community. The machinery manufacturing industry has also developed greatly, and various agricultural tools and relatively simple machine tools can be manufactured. Steel made with local methods has also been used to make rolling mills. The Weiqu Commune has established 229 industrial enterprises of various sizes, including agricultural tool repair and manufacturing, grain and feed processing, fertilizer, building materials, wood products production, sewing, and shoe making. In less than half a year in 1958, the output value reached 370,000 yuan; in 1959, the planned production is 3.5 million yuan. This item alone will bring an income of more than 110 yuan per person in the commune.

	Public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly. Liberating women's labor, everyone is beaming with joy.

Due to the establishment of public canteens and nurseries, the vast number of women have been liberated from household labor. They have devoted themselves to various productive labors and have also widely participated in political and cultural activities. The illiteracy of young and middle-aged men and women in the Weiqu Commune has been basically eliminated, primary school education has been universalized, and secondary school education will also be universalized. Farmers have begun to create poetry, singing praises to their own victories. Poetry platforms, poetry corridors, and poetry boards can be found in every village. From the summer of 1958 to February of this year, farmers wrote more than 153,000 poems, and the "Farmers' Poetry Collection" was published three times. The commune's amateur cultural troupe performs for the farmers every holiday (they have one day off every half month). The phenomenon of farmers in old China being uncultured and frowning is changing or has already changed.

I also inspected the home for the elderly in Tapo Village of Weiqu Commune. The entire home has eight elderly people who are without support. A cook cooks for them, and they live very well and are beaming with joy. Our enemies slander us for "destroying families" and eliminating "family happiness." Well, listen to the answers of these elderly people: When I asked them how they were living, they said, "Very good! Chairman Mao is truly a living immortal, doing a great good deed for us!" "We orphans and widows, this time a stone has fallen to the ground." An old man named Hou Dengliang excitedly introduced his experience. He is 65 years old this year, without children, and has been a farmhand for landlords since childhood. At the age of 36, he lost sight in his left eye, and his right eye also had problems. The landlord didn't want him anymore, and he begged for food before liberation, suffering all the sins in the world. He said: "Although the government has taken care of me since liberation, it is still difficult without someone to cook for me. Now I can finally relax." People like Hou Dengliang enter the home for the elderly and live a carefree life. What's wrong with that?

	Working hard with overwhelming momentum to continue the leap forward

Based on the actual situation, the unprecedented great leap forward of the national economy in 1958 is beyond doubt. Why can we achieve such magnificent achievements? I believe that this is first and foremost due to the correct leadership of the Party committees at all levels, putting politics in command, and the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao, as well as a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, which are accepted by the people of all ethnic groups in the country and exert unparalleled power. Secondly, the establishment of the people's communes promoted the rapid development of the great leap forward. The people's commune is the best organizational form for the two transitions created by the people of our country based on the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and according to the requirements of the development of productive forces. Once it was established, it promoted the forward development of the great leap forward and demonstrated its unparalleled superiority. As many of the examples mentioned above show, without the organization and promotion of the people's commune, it would be difficult to complete them so quickly and smoothly. Thirdly, the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts in 1957 achieved a decisive victory; the rectification movement brought the relationship between the vast number of cadres and the masses closer; and the people's socialist consciousness soared unprecedentedly. The vigorous mass movements widely carried out on all fronts, as well as breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, establishing a communist style, and boldly inventing and creating, all powerfully promoted the vigorous development of the great leap forward.

Of course, the establishment of the people's commune has been very short, people's understanding varies, and the system is not sound enough, and it is inevitable that there are some shortcomings. For example, some people mistakenly thought that the grain harvest was great, eating didn't cost money, and there was no need to pay attention to saving. Therefore, for a period of time, there was no standard for eating grain, and the commune's warehouse was the canteen's warehouse, taking as much as needed, and the waste of grain was quite serious. As a result, in some commune production teams, there was a phenomenon of grain shortage in the later period. However, any attempt to seize these phenomena, without specific analysis, to deny the brilliant achievements of the great leap forward is unfounded and extremely wrong. After the publication of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning the People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all aspects of understanding were clarified; the recent months of rectification work in the communes have achieved good results. The various systems of the commune are being improved, production efficiency has been greatly improved, and people are working hard with overwhelming momentum to complete the tasks of industrial and agricultural production in 1959.

I believe that with the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, with the rich experience of the great leap forward in 1958, with the unparalleled superior organizational form of the people's commune, with the unprecedentedly high socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of people, and with the encouragement and promotion of the two conferences held at the same time, a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 will achieve a great victory.

专栏：

    在韦曲公社走马观花
    杨子廉委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告、彭真副委员长的报告。完全同意李维汉副主席所作的政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    最近，我以短暂时间，在陕西省长安县的韦曲公社，走马观花地看了一次，现就了解到的点滴情况，谈一点我的看法。
    社员生活比
    前大大改善
    超过当地富
    裕中农水平
    长安县一九五八年粮食每亩平均五百多斤，比一九五七年提高了百分之六十。我视察的韦曲公社，是由三十四个原来的高级社合并建成的。六千多户，三万一千多人。耕地六万二千亩，其中种菜六千亩，种粮五万六千亩。一九五八年总产粮食二千七百七十多万斤，比一九五七年增产百分之九十四，比关中大丰收的一九五六年也增产了百分之四十。每人平均粮食接近九百斤。提前实现了农业发展纲要的要求。这个社的蒋家村生产队（二十三户，一百三十五人），一九五八年跃进得特别突出：该村粮田面积一百三十六点五亩，占耕地面积的百分之六十六点五，其中夏田一百零一亩，平均亩产二百八十四斤，内有小麦六十点八亩，平均亩产三百九十六斤半；秋田一百一十五亩，平均亩产九百四十四斤，内有水稻二十九亩，平均亩产八百九十二斤，高额丰产稻二亩，平均亩产一千零八十三斤；玉米八十五点五亩，亩产一千零五十斤，高额丰产玉米二亩，亩产一千二百斤。全年粮食总产十三万七千二百八十四斤，平均亩产一千零五斤十二两，较一九五七年亩产二百八十五斤半，提高了百分之二百五十五点六；棉花亩产皮棉九十斤，比一九五七年亩产二十五斤提高了二点六倍。该村经济作物面积较大，占耕地面积百分之三十五点四，一向是个缺粮队，公粮从来都是交的贷金，每年一过春节，口粮就靠国家供应。但是一九五八年情况大大不同了。除过交纳公粮外，粮食不但自给自足，而且还卖了余粮。社员生活大大改善，已经超过了当地富裕中农的生活水平。
    小麦茁壮一片葱绿
    农民进行科学研究
    一九五八年冬播小麦，普遍种的很好。他们的口号是：不深耕不种，白地不种，地不整好不种，不密植不种。深翻都在一尺以上，底肥每亩一万至二万斤，下种每亩一般都是三十斤左右，认真贯彻执行了“八字宪法”。目前麦苗一片葱绿，生长茁壮。每亩一般在七、八十万株，丰产田多在百万株以上。群众正以冲天干劲，进行防倒伏、追肥、灌水、防虫等工作。他们信心百倍，意志坚强，正为争取一季顶一年，平均每亩拿到一千五百斤小麦而奋斗。“盖天铺地一百天，镇守小麦六道关，挖断锄磨透锨，丰产榜上夺状元。”这就是农民歌颂他们豪迈气概的诗篇。
    农民也开始了科学研究工作。我看了韦曲公社举办的培育小麦良种的试验田，那里播种了二百七十三种不同品种的小麦，其中有优良品种对比试验、观察试验、播种方法试验还有种子多少试验等等。这些过去认为只是农业专家的事，现在农民自己动手举办了。
    修建渠道水上高原
    兴办工业收入增加
    这个县的水利工作，一九五八年也是突出的大跃进。一年新修的渠道，扩灌面积达到四十万亩，等于已有水地面积五十三万亩的百分之七十五点四。而且渠道主要是高原渠。有名的少陵原、神禾原以及其他的瓦?原、傅家原、鸣犊原等，都是几十公尺到百公尺高的黄土高原，几千年来一直是靠天吃饭；然而在一九五八年，秦岭山谷的河水，一齐引上了原头，大自然正在根本改变面貌。就四条渠道的统计，干渠即长达六十多公里，土、石方一百七十四万五千方，大小建筑物四百多座。这样大的工程，由于群众的冲天干劲，实际只用了几个月的时间就基本上修成了。而且花钱很少，国家只投资了十万多元。群众把渠名之曰“幸福渠”，说“过去想也不敢想的事，今天在共产党的领导下办到了”。
    公社也举办了许多工业企业，其中县办的钢铁厂，在全民大办钢铁运动的基础上，目前一个钢铁联合企业的规模已经形成。机械制造业也有很大发展，各种农具、比较简单的机床都可制造，还用土钢制成了轧钢机。韦曲公社创办了大小工业企业二百二十九个，有农具修造、粮食饲料加工、肥料、建筑材料、木器生产、缝纫、制鞋等等。一九五八年不到半年的时间，产值达到三十七万元；一九五九年计划生产三百五十万元，只这一项全社每人即可收入一百一十余元。
    公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院
    解放妇女劳力人人喜笑颜开
    由于办了公共食堂、托儿所，把广大妇女从家务劳动中解放了出来，她们投入了各种生产劳动，也广泛地参与了政治和文教活动。韦曲公社男女青壮年文盲已基本扫除，小学教育已经普及，中学教育也将要普及。农民已开始创作诗歌，歌颂自己的胜利，诗台、诗廊、诗牌，村村都有。一九五八年夏季到今年二月，农民写的诗达到十五万三千多首，“农民诗集”出刊三次。公社的业余文工团，每当假日（他们实行半月休假一天）就向农民演出。旧中国农民没文化、愁眉苦脸的现象，正在或者已经改观。
    我还视察了韦曲公社塔坡村的敬老院，全院有八个无依无靠的老年人，一个炊事员给他们做饭，生活得很好，喜笑颜开。我们的敌人诬蔑我们“破坏了家庭”，消灭了什么“天伦之乐”，那么请听这些老年人的答复吧：当我问他们生活得怎样？他们说：“非常好！毛主席真是活神仙，给我们办了天大的好事”！“我们这些孤寡老人，这一下一块石头落到实处了”。一个叫侯登亮的老人，还兴奋得介绍了他的经历。他今年六十五岁，无儿无女，自小给地主当长工，三十六岁上左眼失明，右眼也生了毛病，地主不要了，解放前一直讨饭吃，受尽了人间罪苦。他说：“解放后政府虽有照顾，但没人做饭仍有困难，这一下才把心放下了。”像侯登亮这样的人，入了敬老院，过着无忧无虑的生活，这有什么不好呢？
    正以排山倒海之势
    努力劳动继续跃进
    根据实际情况看来，一九五八年国民经济的空前大跃进，这是丝毫不容置疑的。为什么能够取得这样宏伟的成绩呢？我认为：这首先是由于各级党委的正确领导，政治挂帅，党和毛主席制定的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，以及一整套两条腿走路的伟大方针、政策，为全国各族人民所接受，发挥无比的威力。其次是人民公社的创立，推动了大跃进的迅速发展。人民公社是在工农业生产大跃进的基础上，根据生产力发展的要求，我国人民创造的两个过渡的最好组织形式。它一经创立，就又推动了大跃进的向前发展，显示了它的无比优越性。如上所述的许多事例，如果没有人民公社的组织推动，是很难如此迅速而顺利的完成的。第三是由于一九五七年在思想战线上和政治战线上的社会主义革命，取得了决定性的胜利；整风运动促使广大干部和群众的关系更加密切；人民社会主义觉悟空前高涨。各个战线上广泛开展的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，以及破除迷信，解放思想，树立共产主义风格，大胆地发明创造等等，都有力地推动了大跃进的蓬勃发展。
    当然，人民公社的建立，时间还很短，人们的认识，参差不齐，制度还不够健全，难免没有一点缺点。比如有的人错误地以为粮食大丰收了，吃饭不要钱了，用不着再注意节约了。于是在一个时期，吃粮没有标准，公社的仓库就是食堂的仓库，要多少拿多少，粮食浪费相当严重。以致某些公社的生产队，发生粮食后期偏紧的现象。但是，任何抓住这些现象，不加具体分析，企图否定大跃进的辉煌成就，都是没有根据的，也是极端错误的。经过党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的公布，澄清了各方面的认识；最近几个月的整社工作，已取得了良好的效果。公社的各种制度正在健全，生产效率大大提高，人们正以排山倒海之势，努力劳动，为完成一九五九年工农业生产任务而奋斗。
    我相信有中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，有一九五八年大跃进的丰富经验，有人民公社这种无比优越的组织形式，有广大人民空前高涨的社会主义积极性，有这次同时召开的两个大会的鼓舞和推动，一九五九年更大、更好、更全面的跃进，将取得伟大的胜利。
