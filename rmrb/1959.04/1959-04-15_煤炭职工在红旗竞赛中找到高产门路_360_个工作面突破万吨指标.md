Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The large-scale Red Flag Emulation Drive for bumper coal production, launched by coal mine workers nationwide following the National Radio Conference on March 2nd, has already yielded significant results. A large number of high-yield workfaces have emerged in coal mines across the country. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Coal Industry, the twenty-eight mining bureaus directly managed by the Ministry of Coal have 360 workfaces that have reached a monthly production level of over 10,000 tons, accounting for over 26% of all coal mine workfaces in these mining bureaus. Among the 360 high-yield workfaces, 64 have reached a monthly production of over 20,000 tons, and 8 have reached a monthly production of over 30,000 tons. Among the twenty-eight mining bureaus, ten have reached the standard of a "10,000-ton bureau" (meaning that the average monthly output of all workfaces in the bureau exceeds 10,000 tons of coal). These mining bureaus are: Kailuan, Xishan, Fushun, Jiaozuo, Hebi, Xuzhou, Fengfeng, Fenxi, Jingxi, and Xinwen. Among them, the average monthly coal extraction of each workface in Kailuan Mining Bureau reached more than 15,600 tons, Xishan reached more than 14,000 tons, and Fushun reached more than 13,900 tons.

In the course of carrying out the large-scale Red Flag Emulation Drive for bumper coal production, many coal mines mobilized the masses of workers to engage in extensive airing of views, full expression of opinions, big debates, and posting of big-character posters. In these "Four Greats," the workers reasoned, calculated accounts in detail, and offered suggestions, finding many ways to improve production. Hongshan Coal Mine, under the Zibo Mining Bureau, had unsatisfactory production performance in January and February, leading some cadres to doubt the possibility of organizing a large-scale bumper coal production. After airing views and calculating accounts in detail, it was discovered that there was great potential in terms of equipment capacity, labor efficiency, work-hour utilization, and attendance rate. Everyone's confidence increased, and their enthusiasm was boosted. In March, they basically reached the standard of a 10,000-ton mine. When Fushun Coal Mine launched a discussion among workers on the production plan for the second quarter, it organized extensive airing of views and full expression of opinions, resulting in over 9,000 suggestions for improving management and innovating production techniques. As a result, after fulfilling the plan by ten-day periods in March, it exceeded the production plan for the first ten days of April by 3.9%. The workers engaged in stripping work at this mine created a historical record of stripping over 167,000 cubic meters on the 8th. Kailuan Mining Bureau's Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine originally lacked 100,000 tons of recoverable coal in the first quarter. However, the Party branch of the Second Excavation District mobilized the masses of workers to air views and discuss the situation, launching a "Five Satisfactions" campaign, which resulted in four workfaces being transferred to production approximately two months ahead of schedule. As a result, the production plan for the first quarter was overfulfilled.

Many coal mines have been vigorously engaged in technical revolution and have conscientiously studied and promoted the twelve advanced experiences for improving production proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry in the large-scale Red Flag Emulation Drive for bumper coal production. Kailuan Coal Mine has universally organized multi-cycle operations. In March, they performed 152 more regular cycles than in February, thereby increasing the daily output of the entire mine by 2,000 tons. Hongshan Coal Mine flexibly adopted single-cycle, double-cycle, paired-cycle, three-cycle, and four-shift staggered operations, based on geological conditions, making 91 more cycles in March than in February, thereby increasing output by more than 18,000 tons. All fourteen coal-cutting machines in this coal mine had their cutting discs lengthened based on the specific situation, thereby increasing output by more than 11%. According to the calculations of eight workfaces in this coal mine, lengthening the cutting disc was equivalent to opening another workface with a monthly output of 6,000 tons. One workface in Fengfeng Coal Mine, in a thin coal seam of 1.4 meters, promoted the experience of Kailuan Coal Mine in vigorously engaging in bumper coal production, also creating an excellent record of over 15,700 tons of monthly production.

Some coal mines have also strengthened production management and established and improved necessary responsibility systems in the large-scale bumper production campaign. Fushun Coal Mine organized dedicated personnel to be responsible for leading production, ensuring that there was command in every shift and management in every location. One workface in Fengfeng No. 2 Mine implemented a system of "two inspections and one dedicated responsibility" in terms of machinery maintenance. Someone inspected before shift handover, someone inspected before coal extraction, and someone was specially responsible for inspecting the chute. In the past, the chain often broke three or four times in one shift, often delaying coal extraction for more than one to three hours. Since the establishment of the above-mentioned responsibility system, mechanical and electrical accidents have been greatly reduced.

Currently, workers at Yongchuan Coal Mine and other mines are working hard to fulfill their proposals and competition conditions to fraternal mines, in order to welcome the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

### 煤炭职工在红旗竞赛中找到高产门路  360个工作面突破万吨指标

　　煤炭职工在红旗竞赛中找到高产门路
　　360个工作面突破万吨指标
    新华社14日讯　全国煤矿职工在3月2日全国广播大会之后开展起来的大面积丰产红旗竞赛，已经取得显著成绩，一大批高产工作面相继在各地煤矿中出现。据煤炭工业部不完全的统计，原来直接由煤炭部管理的二十八个矿务局，目前已经有三百六十个工作面达到月产万吨以上的水平，占这些矿务局全部煤矿工作面的26％以上。在三百六十个高产工作面中，有六十四个达到月产两万吨以上，八个达到月产三万吨以上。在二十八个矿务局中，有十个矿务局已经达到万吨局的标准（万吨局即全局所有工作面平均月产量万吨煤以上）。这些矿务局是：开滦、西山、抚顺、焦作、鹤壁、徐州、峰峰、汾西、京西、新汶。其中，开滦矿务局各工作面平均月采煤达到一万五千六百多吨，西山达到一万四千多吨，抚顺达到一万三千九百多吨。
    在开展大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动中，许多煤矿都发动职工群众大鸣，大放，大辩论和贴大字报，职工群众在“四大”中讲道理，算细账，献计策，找到了许多提高生产的门路。淄博矿务局所属洪山煤矿，因为1、2月份生产情况不够好，一部分干部因此对组织大面积丰产有怀疑。经过鸣放算细账以后，发现在设备能力、劳动效率、工时利用和出勤率等方面都有很大潜力，大家信心提高，干劲鼓起来了，3月份就基本上达到了万吨矿的标准。抚顺煤矿在发动职工讨论第二季度生产计划时，组织大鸣大放，获得了改进管理和革新生产技术的建议九千多条。结果继3月份按旬完成计划之后，4月份又超额3.9％完成上旬生产计划。这个矿担任剥离工作的职工，8日创造了剥离量十六万七千多立方公尺的历史最高纪录。开滦矿务局赵各庄煤矿在第一季度本来缺少十万吨可采煤量，由于掘进二区党支部发动职工群众鸣放讨论，开展“五满意”运动，使四个工作面提前两个月左右移交生产，结果第一季度生产计划超额完成。
    许多煤矿在大面积丰产红旗竞赛中，都大搞技术革命，认真学习和推广煤炭部提出的十二项改进生产的先进经验。开滦煤矿普遍组织了多循环作业，3月份他们作的正规循环比2月份增加一百五十二次，因而使全矿的日产量提高了二千吨。洪山煤矿根据地质条件灵活地采用了单循环、双循环、对偶循环、三循环和四班交叉作业的多循环，使3月份比2月份多作九十一个循环，因而使产量提高一万八千多吨。这个煤矿的十四台截煤机，都分别情况加长了截盘，因而使产量提高11％以上。根据这个煤矿八个工作面的计算，由于加长截盘，等于多开了一个月产六千吨的工作面。峰峰煤矿有一个工作面，在一公尺四的薄煤层中，推广了开滦煤矿大搞丰产工作面的经验，也创造了月产一万五千七百多吨的优异成绩。
    有些煤矿在大面积丰产运动中，还加强了生产管理，建立和健全了必要的责任制度。抚顺煤矿组织专人负责领导生产，作到班班有指挥，处处有人管。峰峰二矿一个工作面，在机械维护方面实行了两检查、一专责的制度。在交接班以前有人检查，出煤以前有人检查，还有人专门检查溜子。过去在一个小班里，链子经常要断三、四次，以致常常耽误一个多钟头到三个多钟头不能出煤。自从建立上述责任制度后，机电事故就大大减少了。
    目前，永川煤矿等矿的职工正在努力实现自己向各兄弟矿所提出的倡议和竞赛条件，以迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
