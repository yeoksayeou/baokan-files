　　All Things Stem from the Root
　　Qian Lu
    A towering skyscraper must be built from the ground up, and a magnificent tree must grow from its roots. Therefore, nothing can exist without roots. The same is true for cultivating new socialist people. We begin to cultivate new socialist people from early childhood education. However, that is just childcare and upbringing, merely preliminary education. Formal school life begins with primary school. Therefore, in school education, we must lay a good foundation for students from a young age in primary education. If the quality of primary school teaching is improved, secondary school teaching will have a foundation; if the quality of secondary school teaching is improved, university teaching will have a foundation; if the quality of university teaching is improved, cultured laborers with socialist consciousness can grow up better. Of course, in different stages of schooling, we must pay attention to improving the quality of student cultivation. But if the work in the previous stage is done well, it will bring many conveniences to the work in the later stage. From this, it can be seen that primary education is fundamental. A primary school teacher said it well: "Educating children is like managing a small tree. If it is not managed well, the tree will not grow straight."
    With the Party's correct educational policy as our guide, we can do our work well. For primary school teachers, the task is even more arduous. For example, grading papers is a very complex and detailed task, requiring grading word by word, adding comments, and marking circles or scores. Also, for example, when talking to students, what methods and approaches are more appropriate for students with different temperaments and personalities, and so on. Primary school teachers should conscientiously and responsibly do these tasks well. Many primary school teachers grade papers early and late, using all their efforts. However, some teachers do not pay much attention to such specific matters as grading papers, and some even let students grade their own papers or do not grade them at all. This approach is questionable. Primary school students need specific help. Teachers may not grade papers sometimes because they are busy. But if teachers often do not grade papers, what are they busy with? From the perspective of a teacher's professional work, grading papers is an indispensable task. By analogy, people will naturally make corresponding demands on other aspects of teaching work.
    How should teachers respond to these demands? Facing the bright red scarves, the future of the motherland, and the flowers of humanity, teachers must have a red heart, that is, a passionate heart. This is the main point. With a red heart and a passionate heart, one can better radiate light and heat from one's professional knowledge. In a word, it is being both red and expert. One primary school teacher proposed, "Know people, know feelings, know hearts, and manage both teaching and learning." One primary school teacher wrote a "motto" for himself: the first line is "Teachers are responsible for cultivating talents for the revolution"; the second line is "Students should strive to benefit the people." I think this will be the best response from teachers to people's demands. Of course, the teacher's hard work will not be in vain. They will hear the voices of "I respect the teacher" and "I love the teacher" from the people and students, and they will cultivate vigorous socialist builders.

　　万事从根起
　　钱路
    一座万丈高楼要从平地盖起，一棵凌霄大树要从根上长起。所以，万物离不了根。培养社会主义新人也是这样。我们培养社会主义新人，从幼儿教育就开始了。但是，那还不过是对幼儿进行保育和教养，仅仅是初步的教育。正式的学习生活，还是从小学开始的。因此，在学校教育中，要在小学教育中替学生从小打好根基。小学的教学质量提高了，中学的教学就有了基础；中学的教学质量提高了，大学的教学也就有了基础；大学的教学质量提高了，有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者就能更好地成长起来。当然，在不同阶段的学校中，都要注意提高自己培养学生的质量。但如果前一阶段的工作做好了，就会为后一阶段的工作带来很多便利。由此可见小学教育是个根子。一个小学教师说得好：“教育孩子，就如管理一棵小树一样。如若管理不好，树会长不直的。”
    我们有了党的正确的教育方针作指针，就可以很好地做工作。对于小学教师来说，任务更是繁重。例如，改卷子，就是一项很复杂细致的工作，要一个一个字地改，要加上批语，要打上圈圈，或者加上分数。又如，对学生谈话，对什么样脾气、什么样性格的学生，采取什么样的方法方式才比较合适，等等。小学教师都应当认真负责地作好这些工作。小学教师改卷子，许多人是夙兴夜寐，用尽心力的。但是，也有一些教师，对改卷子这样具体的事就不大注意，甚至有的教师将卷子交给学生自己来批改，或者不批改。这样做法就值得商榷了。小学生是需要具体地去帮助的。教师不批改卷子，可能因为有时忙一些。但是，如果教师经常不批改卷子，那又在忙着什么呢？从教师的业务说来批改卷子是一件不可忽视的工作。举一而反三，对于其它方面的教学工作，人们自然也会提出相应的要求。
    教师如何来回答这些要求呢？面对着如花似锦的红领巾，祖国的未来，人类的花朵，教师要有颗红心，也就是要有颗热心。这是主要之点。有了红心，有了热心，才能把自己的业务知识更好地发出光和热来。一句话，就是又红又专。一个小学教师提出，“知人，知情，知心，既管教又管会。”有一个小学教师为自己作了一副“座右铭”，上联是“为革命育英才教师有责”；下联是“替人民谋幸福学生勉之”。我想，这将是教师对于人们要求的最好的一种回答。当然，教师的心血是不会白费的。他们会听得到人们和学生的“我敬老师”、“我爱老师”的声音，会培养出生龙活虎的社会主义的建设者。
