　　The Bandit's Black Cloth
　　Xie Fan
    Recently, American imperialism is colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, under the pretext of holding a "special exhibition in Brazil, South America," plotting to steal cultural relics from Taiwan, China. This indecent method of theft by the United States naturally reminds people of the traditional bandit attire in American movies—the habit of covering the face with a black cloth when committing robbery. This traditional bandit attire is an extremely crude method, which also shows their cowardly nature. In fact, in the United States of the twentieth century, it is not only bandits who still use this traditional attire, but also all of the U.S. government's domestic and foreign policies are nothing more than "black cloths" for various forms of robbery, only slightly more sophisticated in their tricks.
    The "black cloth" for the recent conspiracy to steal cultural relics from Taiwan, China, has already been changed twice. The first piece was brought out by Horace Jayne, the vice director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, called "long-term loan," and as a result, under the resolute opposition of the entire Chinese people, the bandit's face was exposed. Therefore, now they have changed another piece, attempting to secretly steal under the pretext of a so-called "special exhibition." However, the bandit's face is still not covered. A bandit is always a bandit, no matter how many black cloths are changed, the bandit's face cannot be changed. The Chinese people have a fresh memory of the American imperialists' banditry in stealing our precious cultural relics. The United States' theft of our precious cultural relics is not the first time, but started as early as 1903. Americans Ding Tingxun, Glasby, Warner, and Andrews, under the guise of investigation and collection, openly robbed ancient Chinese cultural relics. Among them, Andrews was particularly egregious, coming to China four times to steal cultural relics. Now, almost all famous museums in the United States have collections of precious ancient Chinese cultural relics and works of art.
    The methods used by American imperialists to steal cultural relics are, in fact, a truly brutal destruction of the world's ancient cultural objects. A few examples are enough to show the severity of their crimes.
    The Northern Wei dynasty's bas-relief of the procession of worshippers in the Yi Bin Cave of Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, the right hand of the Vairocana Buddha in Fengxian Temple, and the Buddha's head, cross-legged Buddha, and Shakyamuni pensive statue in Guyang Cave were all chiseled away by spies bribed by American imperialists.
    The Tang dynasty statues of Tianlong Mountain in Taiyuan, which had been preserved for over a thousand years without damage, were almost dismembered into broken heads and missing feet in the thirty years before liberation. Although the Yamanaka Shokai of Japan was in charge of the robbery of Tianlong Mountain, its business center was in New York.
    Yun'gang, one of the glories of world cultural history, lost more than 300 Buddha heads, and American museums hold the most.
    Probably the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which clamored for "long-term loans," still displays precious works of art looted from our country, such as Ju Ran's "Misty River and Layered Peaks," Liu Cai's "Swimming Fish," and Guo Xi's "Stream and Mountain Covered in Snow."
    The Chinese people will never forget the history of American imperialists' robbery of ancient Chinese cultural relics. China is a cultural power with a long history, and the Chinese people are also a great people who particularly cherish their cultural history. How can they tolerate American imperialists' theft of our precious cultural heritage! No matter what kind of black cloth it uses to cover its theft, it cannot cover its bandit face. We must expose it in broad daylight; and no matter what kind of robbery method it adopts, even if these cultural relics are robbed to the ends of the earth and fall into the hands of any foreigner, the Chinese people will definitely recover them.

　　强盗的黑布
　　谢帆
    最近美帝国主义正在勾结蒋介石集团，假借“在南美洲巴西举行特别展览”的名义，阴谋盗劫我国台湾的文物。美国这种不体面的盗劫方式，使人们很自然地想起了美国电影里那种传统的强盗装束——在进行抢劫的时候，习惯于用黑布遮住面孔。这种传统的强盗装束，是极其粗陋的办法，也说明了他们贼胆心虚。其实，在二十世纪的美国，岂只强盗仍然沿用着这种传统的装束，就是美国政府的一切内外政策，也不过是各种各样不同的抢劫行为的“黑布”，比强盗高明的，只是花样翻新一点。
    最近阴谋盗劫我国台湾文物的“黑布”，就已经换过了两块。第一块是美国费城艺术馆副馆长霍雷斯·杰尼拿出来的，叫做“长期出借”，结果在全中国人民的坚决反对下，强盗面孔被揭露了；于是，现在又换了一块，企图假借所谓“特别展览”的名义秘密盗劫。但是，强盗面孔仍然是没有掩盖住。强盗总归是强盗，无论是换了多少块黑布，也换不掉那强盗的面孔。中国人民对于美帝国主义盗劫我国珍贵文物的强盗行为，一直是记忆犹新的。美国盗劫我国的珍贵文物，这不是第一次，而是远在1903年就已经开始了。美国人甸亭顿，格拉斯比，瓦尔纳，安助斯，都以调查采集为名，公开抢劫过我国的古文物。其中特别恶劣的是安助斯，他前后来中国盗劫文物达四次之多。现在几乎在美国的有名的博物馆里，都藏有中国的珍贵的古文物和美术品。
    美帝国主义者盗劫文物的方式，实际上是对于世界文化古物名副其实的粗野的破坏，略举数端，就足以看出他们的严重罪行了。
    洛阳龙门宜宾洞的北魏人供养行列的浮雕，奉先寺卢舍那大佛的右手，古阳洞的佛头，交脚坐佛，释迦思维像，都是被美帝国主义买通奸细凿取走的。
    太原天龙山的唐代造像，保存了千余年未受损伤，而在解放前三十年间几乎都被支解得断头缺足，主持天龙山盗劫的虽然是日本山中商会，但它的营业中心就在纽约。
    那世界文化史的光荣之一的云岗，失去了佛头三百多颗，而美国博物馆藏贮最多。
    大概就是那个叫嚣“长期出借”的费城艺术馆，现在还陈列着从我国劫取去的珍贵的美术品，巨然的“烟江叠嶂”，刘宷的“游鱼”，郭熙的“溪山积雪”。
    美帝国主义盗劫中国古代文物的强盗历史，中国人民是永远不会忘记的，中国是有悠久历史的文化古国，中国人民也是特别珍爱自己文化历史的伟大人民，怎能容忍美帝国主义盗劫我国的珍贵文化遗产！不管它是用什么样的黑布掩盖它的盗劫，也掩盖不了它的强盗面孔。我们一定要把它揭露在光天化日下面；也不管它采取什么样的盗劫方式，把这些文物劫到天涯海角，落入任何外国人之手，中国人民都一定要追回来的。
