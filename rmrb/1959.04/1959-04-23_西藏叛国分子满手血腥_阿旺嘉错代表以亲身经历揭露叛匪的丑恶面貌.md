Comrade Chairman, esteemed representatives:

I fully agree with the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Premier Zhou Enlai’s analysis of the Tibetan rebellion in his report was stern and just, and his hopes for the Dalai Lama were sincere and heartfelt, which made me very excited. Yesterday, I saw the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" in the newspaper, which was full of fabrications and slanders. This so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" suddenly appeared when the Dalai Lama had been abducted and completely lost his freedom to express his opinions, and it was clearly imposed upon him by others. I cannot but express my greatest indignation at this! (Warm applause)

The Rebel Bandits Have Always Colluded with Imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek Gangs, and Their Hands are Already Covered in the Blood of the Tibetan People

Just as our country's industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings have achieved great victories, the face of the motherland is undergoing rapid changes, and the people of all ethnic groups across the country are marching forward with full confidence, the majority of Kālons and the upper-class reactionary group of the former Tibetan local government dared to violate the will of the Tibetan people, collude with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, and openly carry out rebellion. This crime of betraying the motherland and undermining the unity of all ethnic groups has been resolutely opposed and severely condemned by the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and has suffered a shameful defeat. For a long time, a small handful of Tibetan traitors have been carrying out conspiracies to collude with imperialists and foreign reactionaries to undermine the unity of the motherland. They shamelessly use the banner of "protecting national interests" and "protecting religion," distorting the truth, deceiving the masses, splitting the unity of all ethnic groups, clamoring for "Tibetan independence," and attempting to sell Tibet to foreign aggressors. They have become the common enemy of all ethnic groups. (Applause) I have lived in Tibet for twenty-seven years and have personally witnessed the actions of these reactionaries. They have been shouting reactionary slogans such as "Tibetan independence" and "drive out the Han people," with the aim of seeking refuge with imperialists and maintaining their dark rule over a minority of people. As early as the late Qing Dynasty, the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet, in order to maintain its own interests, colluded with the forces of imperialism to invade Tibet, causing heavy losses to the lives and property of the Tibetan people. Now, the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet is again colluding with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to openly carry out rebellion and disrupt the peaceful life of the people. Is this "protecting national interests"? In fact, these upper-class reactionaries who shout "protecting national interests" have long been covered in the blood of the Tibetan people. They have been levying exorbitant taxes, committing murder and arson, rape and pillage, and all kinds of evil. They have also raised Tibetan troops, set up prisons everywhere, and used cruel tortures such as gouging out eyes, cutting off noses, pulling out hearts, and skinning people alive to suppress the people. The poor Tibetan people have suffered the heavy oppression and exploitation of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, and have lived the darkest and most miserable lives for a long time. How many families have been forced to wander the streets, begging for a living, and how many families have been forced to become separated, with their families broken up and destroyed! However, their bloody rule can never destroy the Tibetan people's will to resist. The deeper the Tibetan people suffer, the more urgent their desire for liberation becomes. The broad masses of Tibetan people know clearly from historical facts that these reactionary rulers who shout "protecting national interests" are their real enemies. Now the time has come to completely destroy this reactionary rule. (Warm applause)

Reactionary Elements Use the Excuse of Protecting Religion to Do All Kinds of Bad Things, Becoming Sinners Who Betray the Motherland and Buddhist Doctrines

"Protecting religion" is another banner raised by Tibetan traitors. They disguise themselves as devout Buddhists, using "protecting religion" to cover up their criminal activities. However, kind Buddhists will not fall into their trap. I have served as the Khenpo of Sera Monastery and have personally experienced their tricks of playing with religion. When they need to use the name of religion to do something evil, they summon the Khenpos of the three major monasteries in Tibet, including Sera Monastery, to a meeting, impose their will on the masses of lamas, and then use the name of the three major monasteries to deceive the masses. We know that Buddhism has two hundred and fifty-three precepts, and not to mention killing people, even killing small insects is not allowed. However, these reactionary elements, in order to protect their private interests, forced the lamas to violate the precepts and commit the crime of fighting and killing people. In 1947, because the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet colluded with imperialists, they were opposed by the patriotic former Tibetan King Reting Rinpoche. So Kang Wangqinggeller and Lhalu and others led troops to arrest Reting Rinpoche and cruelly tortured him to death. The three major living Buddhas and many lamas under Reting Rinpoche were also persecuted, some imprisoned and some exiled. I myself escaped to the interior because of this. After I escaped, they also issued a notice offering a heavy reward for my head. Later, they killed my younger brother Tsering Gyatso and said that his head was my head, claiming that I had been killed by them, and publicized it extensively. Because of the Reting incident, the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet also led troops to attack Sera Monastery. Nearly one hundred kind and innocent lamas in the monastery were beaten to death or injured, and the thirteen Kongcun villages under the jurisdiction of Sera Monastery were looted. In 1950, when the patriotic Geda Living Buddha arrived in Qamdo for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, he was poisoned to death by Lhalu and the British agent Ford. May I ask, is all this so-called "protecting religion"? Is this the behavior that a devout Buddhist should have? The upper-class reactionary group in Tibet is a sinner who betrays the motherland, betrays the interests of the nation, and betrays Buddhist doctrines. (Applause) Their characteristics are: shamelessness, inhumanity, and you cannot find anything in them that a righteous person should have. (Applause)

The Tibetan People Know Clearly from Personal Experience That They Can Only Have Happiness by Forever Following the Communist Party

Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government has been educating them for a long time, repeatedly advising them, patiently waiting for them to repent and reform, and vigorously helping Tibet in its construction in all aspects. However, these guys have no intention of repenting and reforming, but instead believe that the Central Government is weak and can be deceived. They are faithless and have been secretly colluding with imperialists to carry out conspiracies, vainly attempting to maintain their dark rule over the broad masses of Tibetan working people for a long time. In 1954, when I went to Lhasa to visit the road-building troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I heard about the situation of these traitors organizing the so-called "People's Congress" to conspire to betray the country. Now they dare to openly rebel, which only shows that they have completely misjudged the current situation and the awakening of the masses. The broad masses of Tibetan monks and laypeople have long recognized from their personal experience who is the true defender of the interests of the Tibetan nation, and who is the sinner who sells out national interests and betrays the motherland; who is seriously implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, and who is the heinous jackal in religious clothing? The Tibetan people have long known that only by forever following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can they get rid of poverty and backwardness, and develop and progress together with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland. (Warm and sustained applause)

Since liberation, the Party and the government have implemented ethnic regional autonomy, giving the people of all ethnic groups the right to self-governance; and have implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, protecting the people's freedom of religious belief. This is something that has never happened in history. Our broad masses of anti-imperialist and patriotic religious believers will never allow anyone to use religion to carry out sabotage, organize rebellion, massacre the people, and maintain feudal rule. We must resolutely wage unremitting struggle against all bad people and bad deeds in the religious community and against counter-revolutionaries who use religion to carry out destructive activities. (Warm applause)

The broad masses of working people in Tibet are eager to stand up and be liberated, and they will never forget the disasters brought to them by imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, foreign reactionaries, and Tibetan reactionary rulers. They sincerely hope for the progress and development of the nation. The rebellion of the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet, in addition to accelerating its own demise, can never stop the Tibetan people from moving forward. The conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists to split Tibet and control it in their clutches will be completely shattered. (Applause) We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the unity of our great motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups will be further consolidated, and the Tibetan people will forever end the dark rule of feudal serf society and be reborn. Now, a happy, prosperous, democratic, and socialist new Tibet is already unfolding before our eyes. (Long and warm applause)

Finally, I shout:

Resolutely support the State Council's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government! (Applause)

Oppose Tibetan traitors and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion! (Applause)

Resolutely safeguard the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups! (Applause)

Long live the Chinese Communist Party! (Applause)

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups! (Warm applause)

### 西藏叛国分子满手血腥  阿旺嘉错代表以亲身经历揭露叛匪的丑恶面貌

专栏：

    西藏叛国分子满手血腥
    阿旺嘉错代表以亲身经历揭露叛匪的丑恶面貌主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。周恩来总理报告中关于西藏叛乱问题的分析词严义正，对于达赖喇嘛的希望，情真意挚，内心感到十分兴奋。昨天看到报上登载的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，字里行间充满了捏造和诬蔑，这个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”是在达赖喇嘛被劫持以及完全失去了自由发表意见的情况突然出现，显然是别人强加于他的。对此，我不能不表示最大的愤慨。（热烈鼓掌）
    叛匪一向勾结帝国主义和蒋匪帮双手早已染满了西藏人民的鲜血
    正当我国工农业生产和其它各项建设事业取得巨大的胜利，祖国的面貌起着日新月异的变化，全国各民族人民满怀信心，大踏步地向前迈进的时候，原西藏地方政府的多数噶伦和上层反动集团，竟敢违背西藏人民的意志，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，公开进行叛乱。这种背叛祖国，破坏各民族团结的罪行已经遭到全国各族人民的坚决反对和严厉谴责，已经遭到了可耻的失败。一小撮西藏叛国分子长期以来，就一直进行着勾结帝国主义和外国反动派破坏祖国统一的阴谋活动。他们毫无廉耻地打着“保护民族利益”和“保护宗教”的招牌，颠倒黑白，欺骗群众，分裂各民族的团结，叫嚷“西藏独立”，企图把西藏出卖给外国侵略者。他们已经成为各族人民的公敌了。（鼓掌）我曾经在西藏居住二十七年，亲眼见过这些反动分子的所作所为。他们一直在叫喊“西藏独立”、“赶走汉人”等等反动口号，其目的无非是希图投靠帝国主义，维持他们少数人的黑暗统治。早在清朝末年，西藏上层反动集团，为了保持本身利益，就勾引帝国主义的势力侵入西藏，使西藏人民生命财产遭到惨重损失。现在西藏上层反动集团又勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派公开进行叛乱，破坏人民的和平生活，难道这是“保护民族利益”吗？其实，这些叫喊“保护民族利益”的上层反动分子，他们的双手早已染满了西藏人民的鲜血。他们横征暴敛，杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，无恶不作。他们还豢养藏军，遍设监狱，采用挖眼、割鼻、扒心、剥皮等等酷刑，镇压人民。穷苦的西藏人民受尽原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的重重压迫剥削，长期过着最黑暗、最悲惨的生活。多少人家被逼得流浪街头，乞讨度日，多少人家被逼得妻离子散，家破人亡啊！但是，他们的血腥统治决不能摧毁西藏人民的反抗意志。西藏人民受苦越深，要求解放的愿望也越加迫切。广大的西藏人民从历史事实中清楚地知道，正是这些叫喊“保护民族利益”的反动统治者，才是他们真正的敌人。现在彻底摧毁这一反动统治的时期已经来到了。（热烈鼓掌）
    反动分子借口保护宗教干尽坏事成为背叛祖国和佛教教义的罪人
      “保护宗教”是西藏叛国分子打出的另一个旗帜。他们伪装成虔诚的佛教徒，利用“保护宗教”，掩饰他们的罪恶活动。但是，善良的佛教徒是不会上他们的圈套的。我作过色拉寺堪布，亲身领教过他们玩耍宗教的把戏。当他们需要利用宗教名义来干什么罪恶勾当时，就召集色拉寺等西藏三大寺的堪布开会，把他们的意志强加在喇嘛群众的身上，然后就以三大寺的名义去欺骗群众。我们知道，佛教有二百五十三戒，不要说杀人，就是杀害小虫也不能容许。但是这些反动分子，为了保护私利，却强迫喇嘛违背教规去干打仗杀人的罪行。1947年由于西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义，遭到反帝爱国的原藏王热振活佛的反对，索康·旺清格勒和拉鲁等人，竟带兵捉住热振活佛，用残酷的刑罚将他活活害死。热振活佛下属的三个大活佛和许多喇嘛，有的下狱，有的流放，也通统遭到迫害。我自己也是因此而逃到内地的。我逃出后，他们还通令悬重赏要砍我的头，后来竟将我胞弟茨烈嘉错杀死，把他的头说成是我的头，说我已被他们杀死，而大肆宣传。因为热振事件，西藏上层反动分子还领兵攻打色拉寺，寺内善良无辜的喇嘛被打死、打伤近一百人，色拉寺所辖十三个孔村，被他们抢劫一空。1950年爱国的格达活佛为了和平解放西藏到达昌都的时候被上层反动分子拉鲁和英国特务福特放毒药害死。试问，这一切难道就是所谓“保护宗教”吗？这难道是虔诚的佛教徒应有的行为吗？西藏上层反动集团是背叛祖国、背叛民族利益，背叛佛教教义的罪人。
  （鼓掌）他们的特点是：无耻，毫无人性，在他们的身上找不到一点正直的人应该具有的东西。（鼓掌）
    西藏人民从亲身经历中清楚知道只有永远跟着共产党走才有幸福西藏和平解放以后，中央人民政府长期以来，对他们进行教育，再三忠告，耐心等待他们悔过自新，并从各方面大力帮助西藏进行建设。然而，这些家伙毫无悔改之意，反认为中央软弱可欺，他们背信弃义，一直暗地勾结帝国主义进行阴谋活动，妄想长期维持他们对广大西藏劳动人民的黑暗统治。1954年我去拉萨慰问中国人民解放军筑路部队时，就听说过这些叛国分子组织了所谓“人民会议”阴谋叛国的情况，现在他们竟敢公开叛乱，这只是说明他们把当前的形势和群众的觉悟完全估计错了。广大的西藏僧俗人民从亲身经历中，早已认清谁是西藏民族利益的真正保卫者，而谁又是出卖民族利益，背叛祖国的罪人；是谁在认真执行保护宗教信仰自由的政策，谁是披着宗教外衣的万恶不赦的豺狼？西藏人民早已知道，只有永远跟着共产党和毛主席走，才能摆脱贫困和落后，和祖国各族人民一道共同发展，共同进步。（热烈的、经久不息的掌声）
    解放以来，党和政府实行了民族区域自治，给了各民族人民以自治的权利；贯彻执行了宗教信仰自由政策，保护了人民的宗教信仰自由。这是历史上从来没有的事。我们广大的反帝爱国的教徒，决不容许任何人利用宗教进行破坏，组织叛乱，残杀人民，维护封建统治，我们要坚决向宗教界的一切坏人坏事和利用宗教进行破坏活动的反革命分子进行不懈的斗争。（热烈鼓掌）
    西藏广大的劳动人民是渴望翻身解放的，他们决不会忘记帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮、外国反动派和西藏反动统治者给他们带来的灾难。他们热诚地希望民族的进步和发展。西藏上层反动集团的叛乱，除了加速他们自己的灭亡之外，决不能阻挡西藏人民前进的道路。帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子想把西藏分裂出去掌握在他们魔掌里的阴谋，必将遭到彻底的粉碎。
  （鼓掌）我们深信在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们伟大祖国的统一和各民族的团结将更加巩固，西藏人民也将从此永远地结束封建农奴社会的黑暗统治而获得新生。现在，一个幸福、繁荣、民主的社会主义新西藏已经展现在眼前了。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    最后，我高呼：
    坚决拥护国务院解散原西藏地方政府的命令！（鼓掌）
    反对西藏叛国分子，彻底平息西藏叛乱！
  （鼓掌）
    坚决维护祖国统一和各民族的团结！（鼓掌）
    中国共产党万岁！（鼓掌）
    各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！（热烈鼓掌）
