What Scientific Experiments Are Farmers Doing?
By our reporter Wu Gang

Since planting his high-yield wheat experimental plot, 56-year-old Liu Xijie has been tending to it in the fields all day long. During the days I visited him, I saw him now earthing up the wheat, now spreading ashes, now watering the wheat with a sprinkler...

One day, when he was watering the wheat, he squatted on the edge of the field, constantly touching the wheat seedlings and digging at the yellow soil. Suddenly, he hugged his head and sat down on the edge of the field. "What to do?" It turned out that the wheat seedlings were dense, and when he watered with a small amount, the water couldn't get inside, and the outer soil was too wet, making the wheat prone to lodging due to the loose soil around the roots. When he watered heavily, the wheat seedlings were easily washed down. That night, he couldn't sleep for most of the night; as soon as he closed his eyes, he went to participate in the "Wheat Lodging Struggle Meeting." "Why do you have to lodge?" he kicked the wheat hard, waking up his wife. Early one morning, he went to the well to draw water and accidentally spilled some water on the loose soil on one side, and soon a hole appeared on the other side, and water came out. Aha, so it could penetrate through! He dropped the bucket and rushed to the field, poked a row of small holes in the middle of the wheat ridges with a stick, and when he watered again, the water came out of these small holes, and the wheat on the edges and in the middle of the ridges all got the same amount of water. He was so happy that his whole body trembled.

Liu Xijie is doing even bolder experiments. He wants to cultivate a cotton plant that bears a thousand cotton bolls, and also experiment with perennial cotton. Like many farmers, he pays attention to every agricultural production increase news item in the newspaper and new things in local agriculture. In this way, his mind became unprecedentedly active. He saw a photo of a cotton plant in Xinjiang full of cotton bolls, and news of a cotton plant in Shandong bearing more than 300 bolls; he also saw that some local cotton was irrigated and fertilized exceptionally during the cotton picking season, and then turned green, flowered, and bore bolls... So he figured it out: If the conditions suitable for cotton growth are extended, can't more experiments be produced? If it can bear 300, why can't it bear more? If the experiment is successful, can't it help to greatly increase cotton production in the future? If perennial cotton is successful, there is no need to sow seeds every year, how much labor will be saved! Thinking this way, he dug up four cotton plants, buried them three feet deep, and covered them with three feet of soil, to see if they would sprout this year; he also cultivated some cotton plants in small pots, sowing them earlier than ordinary cotton, and covering them with greenhouses during the frost period to extend the growing season of the cotton.

Bold ideas and practical experiments are often the starting point for new creations. Farmer Zhao Bingheng thinks very far ahead. He wants to make the Chinese toon tree bear cotton. Thinking this way, he grafted cotton onto the Chinese toon tree, and it took root. That day, I went to visit him. It turned out that he was already 67 years old, his eyebrows and hair were like frost, and when he spoke, his head shook involuntarily. He was fertilizing and watering dozens of saplings recently transplanted into the yard, including elm trees, German locust trees, peach trees, and yellow roses, which were prepared for approach grafting with cotton.

After hearing about his experimental process, you will know how tremendous changes have taken place in the thinking of farmers since the Great Leap Forward. For thousands of years, outdated farming methods, pitifully low yields, impoverished lives, and the corrupt old conclusions formed as a result, had been a heavy dam blocking the torrent of farmers' wisdom. After liberation, the situation changed, especially after Chairman Mao proposed liberating thought, daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do last year, when high-yield records constantly emerged across the country and in Shaanxi Province, the heavy dam was opened, and the torrent of farmers' wisdom suddenly boiled and flowed.

In the old society, Zhao Bingheng had also conducted experiments to improve wheat varieties, hybridizing Datouhong and Foshoumai wheat. The villagers' scolding words rained down on him: "Trying to do the impossible, just messing around! Destined to be a sedan chair carrier, and still wants to ride in a sedan chair, born poor and still wants to get rich!" Little food, no clothes, being scolded and suffering made him lose all interest in doing experiments. It wasn't until last year, when news of high yields from all over the place kept coming, and after Chairman Mao proposed to liberate thought, he slapped his thigh, laughed heartily, and said: Good! Let's do it again. Others are working hard and doing everything possible to increase grain and cotton production, can't I worry about food and clothing and live in vain? He thought: The seeds borne by the Chinese toon tree are useless, can't we make the Chinese toon tree bear cotton? He immediately started grafting cotton onto the small Chinese toon tree in the yard. When some people saw it, they shook their heads and said: "It's a waste of effort, how can an ant mate with an ox, how can a herbaceous plant grow together with a woody plant?" He thought that people probably thought it was a waste of effort for him to be the first person to use a tree to graft a tree. Therefore, he still used grafting methods, but failed. Undeterred, he used approach grafting, and seven cotton plants actually grew on the Chinese toon tree, flowering and bearing bolls. These seven cotton plants are now wrapped in straw, waiting to see if they will sprout again. He said to me: "Don't look at me as old, my mind is getting younger and younger. As long as I don't die, I will always come up with something."

Chairman Mao's instructions gave wings to the farmers' thinking. The farmers think freely, and once they come up with some reason, they immediately go to experiment. Zhao Zixiang, who has grown vegetables for 14 years, used to do it according to the old methods. But now he pays attention to every minute change in vegetables anytime, anywhere. Once after the rain, he found that the dried green plum beans sprouted new buds at the roots. According to the old method, green plum beans are harvested and then planted, and harvested and then planted, with two months in between, and no green plum beans to eat. He thought: Can we cut off the dried green plum bean vines, and then water and fertilize them to make them regenerate, saving the trouble of replanting, and also meeting the needs of the off-season market? Coincidentally, he saw the news of Chairman Mao's inspection in Tianjin at that time. The news said that a cadre reported to Chairman Mao that he wanted to graft rice onto reeds, so that he wouldn't have to plant them every year, and cut the reeds and harvest the rice. Chairman Mao told him that this idea was very good and could be tried. When Zhao Zixiang saw it, he felt that Chairman Mao was talking to him, and he immediately tried according to his own ideas, and it really succeeded. The regenerated green plum beans opened bunches of small white flowers as soon as they came up; when they were harvested for the first time, the replanted green plum beans had not yet bloomed.

Some creations seem difficult before they appear; after they appear, they seem very simple. The key question is whether you dare to think or not, dare to do or not. Afterwards, a technician named Li Shipeng who studied horticulture saw it and disapprovingly said: I knew long ago that green plum beans have strong regenerative power. Zhao Zixiang said in his heart: You thought about it early, but you didn't do it according to Chairman Mao's words, and you haven't succeeded until now, and you're still thinking about it in your head. From then on, he firmly remembered Chairman Mao's words to dare to speak and also dare to do, and recently discovered that spinach roots re-sprout, and then experimented with spinach regeneration, which was also successful.

"Don't ask about farming, just do what others do," this was a widely popular saying in old China. Now it is completely different. Farmers not only need to know how to do it to get high yields, but also need to know why it is done this way.

When I visited farmer Yuan Zongzheng, the head of the Sha Hutu Production Brigade and the person in charge of the experimental farm, he was flipping through a pile of newspaper materials. He patted the pile of clippings and said: I have read them all and followed them, but I can't figure out why it's good to do it this way. For example, he did a comparative winter irrigation experiment for wheat, and the winter-irrigated wheat yielded more than 100 jin more than the non-winter-irrigated wheat. It's good to do it this way, but why? He doesn't know. He is determined to figure it out. Like many farmers, he established an experimental farm. There he did various dense planting specifications experiments, 134 different wheat variety experiments, 21 wheat fertilizer effect experiments, as well as intercropping wheat with vegetables, etc. After the wheat was sown, with the help of technical cadres, he used microscopes and dissecting microscopes every five days for observation, recording, analysis and research. These instruments took him to a new world of wheat growth, and he clearly saw how wheat seeds germinate, take root, tiller... Many problems that he did not understand in the past began to understand. He saw that a head emerged from above the tillering node of the wheat before it turned green, and another adventitious root grew below. He realized that winter irrigation and topdressing were precisely to meet the needs of wheat tillering, so he promptly guided the entire team to carry out winter irrigation and topdressing.

The various explorations and experiments carried out for the sake of high yields are attracting the full energy of farmers with great power. Planting crops, which was once considered a painful thing in the old society, is now beginning to become an interesting and happy thing. Yuan Zongzheng said that he had deeply plowed the land in the scorching sun and applied fertilizer in the bitter cold; he had climbed on the microscope all day to observe, so tired that his eyes could not be opened; and he could not eat or sleep in order to solve the problem of wheat lodging... "Is it hard? It seems very hard; but I don't feel it, but I think it's very interesting. There is no other reason, just because the labor for high yields now uses not only physical strength, but also brains!"

Visiting many farmers and listening to what they are thinking gives me a strong feeling: At present, the thinking of Chinese farmers is no longer a stagnant pool of stagnant water like in the past, but a surging torrent, which is rolling forward every moment, and is a huge force driving agricultural production to advance rapidly!

    农民在做什么科学试验
    本报记者　吴钢
    五十六岁的刘希杰，自从种上那块小麦高产试验田以后，整天钻在地里抚弄。在我访问他的那些日子里，只见他一会儿给小麦培土，一会儿撒草木灰，一会儿又拿着喷壶给小麦洒水……。
    有一天，他给小麦浇水时，蹲在地头，不时用手拨拨麦苗，刨刨黄土，突然双手把头一抱，一屁股坐在地头了。“这怎么办？”原来麦苗稠密，他用小水灌，水进不到里边，外边的地又太湿，小麦因根部土壤松，容易倒伏；他用大水浇，又容易把麦苗冲倒。晚上，他大半夜睡不着；才一合眼，就又去参加“小麦倒伏的斗争会”。“你为啥要倒伏”，他用力踢了小麦一脚，把老伴可给踢醒了。一天大早，他去井上打水，偶尔把水倒在一块松土的这边，很快，那一边有个窟窿，水冒出来了。嗬，原来能渗透过去！他丢了桶，急忙忙跑到地里，在麦畦中间用棍子扎了一排小窟窿，再浇时，水就从这些小孔中冒出来，畦子边上和中间的小麦都得到同样的水。他高兴得浑身都忽擞擞价抖起来了。
    刘希杰正在做着更大胆的试验。他想培养一株棉花结一千个棉桃，还要试验多年生棉花。和许多农民一样，他注意着报纸上的每一个农业增产新闻，注意当地农业上的新东西。这样，他的脑子空前灵活起来，他看到新疆一株棉花浑身都结着棉桃的照片，山东一株棉花结桃三百多的新闻；他还看到当地有的棉花在收花时破例灌溉、施肥，以后又返青、开花、结桃……。于是他想开了：要是把适合棉花成长的条件延长，不就能结出更多的试验吗？能结三百，为什么不能结出更多呢？如果试验成功，不是可以帮助今后棉花大大增产吗？如果使多年生棉花成功，就不必每年播种，要节省多少劳动力呢！他这样想着便挖了四株棉花，埋三尺深，又盖上三尺土，看今年是否发芽；他还在小盆里培育了一些棉花，比普通棉花提前下种，在霜期盖上温室，延长棉花的生长期。
    大胆的设想切实的试验，常常是新创造的起点。农民赵秉衡想得很远大。他想让椿树结棉花。他这样想，就在椿树上接棉花，而且接活了。那天，我去访问他。原来他已经六十七岁，眉发似霜，说起话来，头还不由自主地摇幌着。他正在给新近移栽到院子的榆树、德国槐、桃树、黄刺瑰等几十棵树苗施肥、浇水，这是准备用来靠接棉花用的。
    听过他的试验经过，你就会知道大跃进以来农民的思想发生了多么巨大的变化。几千年来，陈旧的耕作方法，低得可怜的产量，穷困的生活，以及由此而形成的那些腐旧的定论，曾经是沉重的大闸，阻挡住了农民智慧的巨流。解放以后，情况变了，特别是当去年毛主席提出解放思想，敢想、敢说、敢做以后，当全国和陕西省一个个高额丰产不断涌现出来时，沉重的闸门打开了，农民智慧的巨流，一下子沸腾了，奔流了。
    在旧社会里，赵秉衡也曾经作过改良小麦品种的试验，他把大头红和佛手麦杂交。村里人骂他的话像雨点一样地落在他身上：“想干办不到的事，尽胡日鬼！命里注定是抬轿的，还要想坐轿，生就的穷鬼还想发财哩！”少吃没穿和挨骂受气，使他再也没有一点心思搞试验了。直到去年，各地高额丰产消息不断传来，毛主席提出要解放思想后，他把大腿一拍，哈哈大笑说：好！再来。别人都鼓足干劲，千方百计地为增产粮、棉而苦干，难道我不愁吃穿，白白活着不成。他想：椿树上结的籽没有用，能不能让椿树结棉花呢。他马上动手在院子的小椿树上接棉花。有人一见摇摇头说：“白费劲，蚂蚁怎能和牛配，草本怎能和木本长到一块呢？”他想当第一个用树去接树的人，大概人们也都以为是白费劲。因此他还是用嫁接的办法去接，失败了，他并不灰心，又用靠接的办法，七个棉花居然长在椿树上，开花结桃了。这七株棉花现在用草包扎着，等将来看是否再发芽。他向我说：“可别看我老，我的脑子越活越年青。只要我不死，总要搞出点名堂。”
    毛主席的指示，给农民的思想插上了翅膀。农民们海阔天空地想，一旦想出点道理，便立刻去试验。种过十四年菜的赵子祥，过去都是按照老办法去作。可是现在他随时随地注意着蔬菜的每一个微小的变化。一次雨后，他发现干枯的青梅豆，根部又长出嫩芽。按照老办法，青梅豆是收了再种，种了再收，这中间要隔两个月，没有青梅豆吃。他想：能不能把干枯的青梅豆蔓条剪掉，再浇水、施肥，使它再生，省得重新去种，又满足了淡季市场的供应呢？恰巧，当时他看到毛主席在天津视察的消息。消息说，有个干部向毛主席报告，他想把稻子接到芦苇上，每年不用种，割了芦苇还收下稻子。毛主席告诉他，这个想法很好，可以试一试。赵子祥一看，主席这话像是给他讲的，他马上按自己的想法去试，果然成功了。重新发芽的青梅豆，一上来就开着一串串的小白花；第一次收获时，重新下种的青梅豆还没有开花。
    有一些创造，未出现前好像很难；出现以后又好像很简单。问题的关键是看你敢想不敢想，敢干不敢干。事后，一个叫李士鹏，学园艺的技术员看过，不以为然的讲：我早就知道青梅豆再生力强。赵子祥心里说：你想的早，只是你没有按毛主席的话去做，到如今没弄成，还在脑子里想。从那以后，他牢牢记住毛主席的话敢说还要敢做，最近发现菠菜根重新发芽，又试验菠菜再生，同样也成功了。
    “庄稼活不用问，人家做甚咱做甚”，这是旧中国流行很广的谚语。现在完全不同了。农民们不仅要知道怎样做才能丰产，而且还要知道为什么这样做。
    我访问农民袁宗正时，这位沙泘沱生产大队长，试验农场的负责人正在翻看一堆报纸材料。他用手拍拍那堆剪报说：我都看过，照着去做，可总弄不清为啥这样做就好。比如，他作过小麦冬灌对比试验，冬灌的比不冬灌的增产了一百多斤小麦，这样作好，可是为什么呢？不知道。他决心要搞清楚。和许多农民一样，他建立了试验农场。在那里他作了各种各样的密植规格试验、一百三十四种不同的小麦品种试验，二十一次小麦肥效试验，还有小麦蔬菜间作等等试验。他从小麦下种以后，在技术干部的帮助下，每隔五天用显微镜、解剖镜，进行一次观察、记载，分析和研究。这些仪器把他带到小麦生长的新世界里，他清清楚楚的看出小麦种籽怎样发芽、生根、分蘖……。许多过去他所不理解的问题开始理解了。他看到小麦在返青前分蘖节上面冒出一个头，下面就多出一个自生根。他才知道原来冬灌和追肥，正是为了满足小麦分蘖的需要，于是及时指导全队进行冬灌、追肥。
    为着高额丰产而进行的种种探索、试验，以极大的力量吸引着农民的全副精力。种庄稼这件旧社会曾认为是受苦的事，现在开始成为有意思的快事了。袁宗正说，他曾经迎着烈日深翻地，冒着严寒施肥；他曾经整日爬在显微镜上观察，累得眼睛都睁不开；还为了解决小麦倒伏等等问题，吃不下饭，睡不着觉……。“苦不苦？看来很苦；可是我不觉得，倒觉得挺有意思。这没有别的原因，只因现在为了高额丰产的劳动，不光用体力，还用脑子哩！”
    访问过许多农民，听听他们在想什么，给我一种强烈的感觉：目前我国农民的思想，不再像过去那样是死水一潭，而是一股汹涌澎湃的激流，它每时每刻在向前滚动，是推动着农业生产不断飞速前进的巨大力量！（附图片）
