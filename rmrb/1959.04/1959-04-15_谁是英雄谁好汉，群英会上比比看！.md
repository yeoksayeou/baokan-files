　　Who is a hero, who is a good man? Let's compete at the hero meeting!
　　Meng Tai
    Since the first quarter of this year, our Anshan Iron and Steel Company's factories and mines have launched a massive new upsurge in the steel production battle. Now, some technical difficulties have been overcome, and production levels are rising day by day, but for the entire company, the improvement is not fast enough and has not reached the level required by the state. Recently, a meeting of employee representatives was held, and the Party committee made another mobilization. Everyone's hearts are as red and hot as the molten iron in the furnace. In order to ensure the overfulfillment of this year's production plan, we must catch up quickly, liberate our minds, go all out and strive for the top, do everything possible, seize every second, demand steel from time, launch a mass movement, launch a technical revolution, and create miracles. Ensure that production leaps up in the second quarter. Strive to go to Beijing to participate in the Heroes' Conference. It is precisely: Who is a hero, who is a good man? Let's compete at the hero meeting!
    All employees of our Ironmaking Plant resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and the policy of walking on two legs, breaking superstitions, strengthening confidence, and displaying the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. An upsurge in production has been launched. All our employees keep in mind Chairman Mao's instruction to "despise difficulties strategically and take difficulties seriously tactically." For 100% of the targets, we must take 120% of the measures and 240% of the effort. Overcome difficulties, improve quality, and complete production plans on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. All employees conscientiously implement the policy of safe production, ensuring that everyone is in charge of production and everyone is in charge of safety. Ensure the safety of personnel and production equipment.
    In order to achieve a comprehensive and greater leap forward, we must continue to implement the policy of "two participations, three combinations." Launch a mass movement, launch a technical revolution, and a technical innovation. All employees must be more ingenious and more energetic. Learn from the advanced and strive for the top. Completely solve the key problems in production. In terms of raw materials and fuel, ensure that blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces are full and well-fed. In terms of blast furnaces in the Ironmaking Plant, we must supply 100% high iron content, high alkalinity, and high-strength artificial rich ore. At the same time, the Ironmaking Plant's employees are determined to push the red flag competition movement, which aims at high production and high quality, focuses on safety and hygiene, and centers on the technical revolution, to a new peak in early April, on the basis of overfulfilling the national production plans of blast furnaces one, two, three, four, five, and six. Establish a daily small evaluation, a ten-day big evaluation, and a monthly general evaluation competition and establish a system of registering deeds and accidents. Under the guidance of the spirit of the nation as a whole, better carry out communist cooperation. Give play to the role of gas workers, so that blast furnace foremen can be liberated from just looking at blast furnace instruments in the signal room, strengthen comprehensive management, and truly become the masters of the blast furnace. And achieve large air volume, high strength, heavy load, and on-time slag and iron tapping, and overcome high silicon and high sulfur. Implement the operating policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio. The employees of the Steelmaking Plant are determined to implement the major measure of hot metal pretreatment to further shorten steelmaking time and increase operating rates. Maintain the correct furnace type, produce steel according to the planned grades, improve casting and reduce waste products; the employees of the Rolling Mill must ensure that they reduce downtime and improve the quality and yield of steel; the employees of the Mechanical Repair must revolutionize mechanical equipment. Ensure the normal production of mechanical equipment; the employees of the Transportation Department will vigorously promote the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, and ensure the supply of raw materials and the output of products for production plants and mines, and accelerate the solution of the railway expansion project in the southern part of East Anshan with the full start of key projects.
    In order to support the needs of industrial and agricultural construction throughout the country, we, the employees of the entire plant, must also train more good technical talents to support brother units throughout the country.
    In order to welcome the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, the employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant are now launching a wide and in-depth red flag competition movement of high production, high quality, and multiple varieties with overwhelming momentum. All our employees are determined to fully complete the national plan and create miracles to present gifts to the conference.

　　谁是英雄谁好汉，群英会上比比看！
　　孟泰
    从今年第一季度以来，我们鞍山钢铁公司各厂矿展开了一个声势浩大的新的夺钢大战高潮。现在，有些技术难关已经突破了，生产水平逐日上升，但就整个公司来讲，提高的还不快，没有达到国家要求水平。最近开了一个职工代表大会，党委又作了动员，大伙儿的心就像炉子里的铁水那样红，那样热。为了保证超额完成今年生产计划，一定得急起直追，解放思想，鼓足干劲力争上游，千方百计、分秒必争，向时间要钢铁，大闹群众运动、大闹技术革命、创造奇迹。保证在第二季度生产跃上去。争取上北京参加群英大会。正是：谁是英雄谁好汉，群英会上比比看！
    我们炼铁厂的全体职工，坚决地贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和两条腿走路的方针，破除迷信，坚定信心，发挥敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。掀起了一个生产高潮。我们全体职工时刻记住毛主席“在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难”的指示。对十分指标，要采取十二分的措施，二十四分干劲。克服困难，提高质量，按日，按旬，按月的完成生产计划。全体职工们认真贯彻安全生产的方针做到人人管生产，人人管安全。保证人身和生产设备的安全。
    为了实现全面的更大跃进，我们要继续贯彻“两参三结合”的方针。大闹群众运动，大闹技术革命，技术革新。全体职工要巧上加巧、劲上加劲。学先进，力争上游。彻底解决生产上的关键问题。在原料、燃料方面保证高炉、平炉吃饱、吃好。在炼铁厂高炉方面要供给百分之百的高铁分、高碱度，高强度的人造富矿。同时炼铁厂职工同志们决心在4月上旬一、二、三、四、五、六高炉超额完成国家生产计划的基础上把以高产、优质为目的，以安全卫生为重点，以技术革命为中心的红旗竞赛运动推向一个新的高峰。建立每天一小评，一旬一大评，一月一总评的竞赛评比和建立事迹、事故登记簿的制度。在全国一盘棋精神指导下更好的展开共产主义大协作。发挥瓦斯工的作用，使高炉工长由过去光在信号室内看高炉仪器表解放出来加强全面的管理，真正成为高炉的主人。并做到大风量，高强度、重负荷，正点出渣、铁，战胜高矽、高硫。贯彻提高冶炼强度和降低焦比同时并举的操作方针。炼钢厂职工同志们决心实现铁水预处理的重大措施，进一步缩短炼钢时间，提高作业率。维护好正确的炉型，按计划钢种出钢，改进铸定，减少废品；轧钢工作职工们要保证做好减少歇时间，提高钢材质量与收得率；机械检修的职工同志要革机械设备的命。保证机械设备正常生产；运输工作的职工大搞装卸机械化和半机械化，保证生产厂矿的原材料供应和产品输出工作，随着重点工程的全面开工，加速解决在东鞍山南部铁路扩建工程。
    我们全厂职工为支援全国各地工农业建设需要，我们还要多多地培养好的技术人才，来支援全国兄弟单位。
    为了迎接第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，我们鞍钢炼铁厂的职工们，现正以排山倒海之势开展广泛深入地高产、优质、多品种的红旗竞赛运动。我们全体职工决心全面完成国家计划，创造奇迹向大会献礼。
