Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 21st: Following the publication of the so-called Dalai Lama's statement, some Indian newspapers have taken the opportunity to stir up trouble, viciously attacking China, interfering in China's internal affairs, and recklessly damaging the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indian peoples.

Despite the fact that some Indian newspapers have pointed out that this so-called Dalai Lama's statement is a suspicious thing riddled with loopholes, the "Times of India" asserted that this statement is "undeniable." It used this statement to distort the truth of the Tibetan rebellion incident, claiming that this statement "presents a picture of communist imperialism." This newspaper portrayed the rebellion of a small group of Tibetan reactionaries in religious robes and the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion as a Chinese attack on so-called Tibetan "religious freedom," insisting that "Beijing ignores Tibet's right to what can be called religious self-determination," and absurdly advocating that "in the case of Tibet, religious freedom and political independence are inseparable."

The "Indian Express," which is particularly diligent in attacking and slandering China in its propaganda, repeats the cliché of so-called "Chinese aggression against Tibet." This newspaper clamored that "India's responsibility is not only to grant asylum to the Dalai Lama, his relatives, and his entourage," and New Delhi should not "induce the Dalai Lama to return again." Although this newspaper is so blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs, it accuses China of violating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, saying that "the country that first signed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with us is violating these principles at our doorstep."

The Bengali newspaper "Ananda Bazar Patrika" publicly insulted our national leaders, viciously calling Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the Tibetan issue at the National People's Congress a "Himalayan lie," and calling the letters from the Dalai Lama to Tan Guansan "fabrications," even though it could not provide any basis for this. This newspaper nonsensically claimed that "China's rule over Tibet is not progressive, it is pure imperialism."

This newspaper, filled with imperialist overtones, also attempts to shift the responsibility for the damage to Sino-Indian friendship caused by certain forces in India onto China, saying that "the Chinese government uses tricks and force to deny Tibet autonomy, it is cutting off the roots of Panchsheel, and it is losing India's sympathy and trust."

It is noteworthy that a few Indian newspapers are even attempting to use the Tibetan rebellion incident to undermine China's relations with other countries. For example, the "Hindustan Times" said, "Chinese leaders loudly support the freedom of subordinate countries and condemn imperialism," but "by suppressing the freedom of Tibet, they have aroused indignation in Asian and African public opinion." The "Glory" deliberately confuses right and wrong, comparing the rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet in collusion with foreign expansionists to the anti-colonial struggle of the Algerian people. This newspaper also incites an atmosphere of opposition to China, clamoring that "it is the duty of freedom-loving countries to express opposition to China."

### 利用所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”  印一些报纸恶毒攻击我国  甚至公然侮辱我国国家领导人

    利用所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”
    印一些报纸恶毒攻击我国
    甚至公然侮辱我国国家领导人
    新华社21日讯　新德里消息：在所谓达赖喇嘛的声明发表以后，印度一些报纸乘机兴风作浪，恶毒地攻击中国，干涉中国内政，不惜损害中印两国人民的友好关系。
    尽管一些印度报纸指出这项所谓达赖喇嘛的声明是漏洞百出的可疑的东西，“印度时报”却断言这项声明“令人难以置疑”。它利用这项声明竭力歪曲西藏叛乱事件的真相，说什么这个声明中“呈现出一幅共产帝国主义的图景”。这家报纸把一小撮披着宗教袈裟的西藏反动分子的叛乱和中国政府平定叛乱说成是中国对所谓西藏“宗教自由”的进攻，硬说是“北京无视西藏的可以说是宗教自决的权利”，它强调“这是一个不可能有所妥协的问题”，而且荒谬地鼓吹什么“在西藏的情况下，宗教自由同政治独立是不可分开的”。
    在攻击和诬蔑中国的宣传中特别卖力的“印度快报”重复着所谓“中国侵略西藏”的滥调。这家报纸叫嚷说：“印度的责任不是给予达赖喇嘛、他的亲属和他的随行人员的避难权就算完了”，新德里不应当“诱使达赖喇嘛再次回去”。尽管这家报纸是如此放肆地干涉中国的内政，但是它却反噬中国违反五项原则，说什么“同我们第一个签订五项和平原则的那个国家就在我们大门口违反这些原则”。
    孟加拉文的“欢喜市场报”公然侮辱我国国家领导人，恶毒地把周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会上关于西藏问题的报告说成是“喜马拉雅山似的谎言”，而且把达赖喇嘛写给谭冠三的信件说成是“捏造”，尽管它提不出任何根据。这家报纸胡说什么“中国对西藏的统治不是进步的，那是纯粹的帝国主义”。
    这家充满着帝国主义腔调的报纸还企图把中印友谊正遭到印度某些势力破坏的责任推到中国头上，说什么“中国政府使用圈套和武力不给西藏自治，它是砍去潘查希拉的根，它正在失去印度的同情和信任”。
    值得注意的是，少数印度报纸竟然企图利用西藏叛乱事件来破坏中国和其他国家的关系。例如，“印度斯坦日报”说，“中国的领袖大声支持附属国的自由，谴责帝国主义”，但是“由于镇压西藏的自由，他们使亚非的舆论表示愤慨”。“荣耀报”故意混淆黑白，把西藏上层反动集团勾结外国扩张主义者而发动的叛乱，同阿尔及利亚人民的反殖民主义斗争相提并论。这家报纸还煽动反对中国的空气，叫嚷“对中国表示反对是爱好自由国家的职责所在”。
