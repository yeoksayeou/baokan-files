    Memories Evoked by "The Bonded Laborer"
    Xia Yan
    In 1927, my organizational affiliation was with the Third Street Branch in Zhabei District, Shanghai. At that time, I did some trade union work for a very short period and became acquainted with some friends who worked in cotton mills. Later, I was transferred to another job and left. At the end of 1929, I lived in Yeguang Lane on Tangshan Road in Pudong, because this was a worker's district. Several comrades who were engaged in the workers' movement often came to my house to "rest" -- they would leave a set of blue worker's clothes at my place. They would come to my house wearing long gowns or suits, change into worker's clothes to go to the factory, and then come back to my place to change back into their original clothes after work. From the conversations of these comrades, I learned about the "bonded laborer" system and the inhuman lives of these young girls. More than a year later, the Shanghai Art Theatre was disbanded, and we organized a mobile theatrical troupe to perform in factories. In order to find connections, I reconnected with a comrade I had known in the past who was a teacher at a workers' night school run by the YMCA (she was the Ms. Feng I later wrote about in "Further Thoughts on Bonded Laborers"). She told me many things about bonded laborers. After the "January 28th" Incident, Comrade Shen Xiling wanted to write a screenplay about Shanghai female workers, so I told him about the material on bonded laborers. This later became the movie "A Woman's Cry," produced by the Star Film Company. This was the first literary work about bonded laborers, but on the one hand, because our understanding of this area was not deep enough, and we were not familiar enough with the life, and at the same time due to the limitations of the environment at the time, the film was repeatedly censored by film censors after it was made, the film did not do very well. However, because of the need to write this film, we re-collected some materials about bonded laborers and learned more about them. The miserable lives of bonded laborers made us intellectuals feel a "shock to the soul." I have also read many literary works depicting the lives of female workers. When I was in Japan, I also saw the lives of Japanese textile female workers, who were universally considered to have the lowest living standards and the worst working conditions in the capitalist world. However, comparing Japanese female workers with bonded laborers was like comparing heaven and hell. It was only then that I realized that in the factories run by imperialism in the twentieth century, the slave system was still openly preserved. I felt angry and felt that I had to expose this human hell, so I decided to write a novel and began to further understand the lives of bonded laborers, but later I put it aside because I was busy with work. It was not until 1935, when the Shanghai Party organization suffered another major setback, and several of our main leaders in the cultural field were arrested, that the organization asked me to temporarily go into hiding. I took this opportunity to begin collecting materials on bonded laborers.
    Through the introduction of comrades from the "Pudong Commune" (a service organization centered on a workers' night school established in Yangshupu by progressives using the YMCA's facilities), I met Xingdi, a Youth League member who worked at the Japanese Naigaiwata Cotton Mill. After talking to her several times, I felt that to truly understand the lives of bonded laborers, it was not enough to simply collect materials, but it was necessary to conduct on-the-spot investigations. I found a classmate from middle school who was an employee at a Japanese cotton mill, and went to the workshop where bonded laborers worked several times to inspect and gained some understanding of their working conditions. However, to understand the "foreman's" management system for bonded laborers and their living conditions, it was necessary to personally investigate the dormitories where the bonded laborers lived. For today's young workers, that situation is probably difficult to understand and difficult to believe. At that time, the dormitories where bonded laborers lived were actually very strictly managed prisons. The dormitories of bonded laborers were tightly sealed off by Japanese police, patrol officers, foremen's henchmen, and gangsters. In order to prevent this group of "slave laborers" from contacting the outside world, no "outsiders" were allowed to enter this forbidden zone. In "The Bonded Laborer," I said that these "bonded laborers" were "canned labor." The capitalists sealed them up and prevented them from contacting the outside air. These words were not an exaggeration at all. In order to break through this blockade, I got help from Xingdi and sneaked in twice, but after that, I was watched by the "assistants" hired by the foremen. What was particularly difficult to observe was that the bonded laborers went to work in the factory early in the morning and only returned to the dormitory at night, so to see their lives going to and from work, it was necessary to be there early in the morning and in the evening. At that time, I lived on Maiteheside Road (now Taixing Road), which was far from Yangshupu. Thus, in order to get to Yangshupu before five o'clock in the morning, I had to get up at three o'clock in the morning and walk more than ten miles to see them going to work. In this way, I worked as a "night worker" for more than two months from the beginning of March to May before I could observe some of their daily lives in more detail. Because they were subjected to triple and quadruple oppression and had suffered countless hardships, these young girls did not dare to talk to people easily, not only to people like us, but even to "outside workers" working in the same factory, it was very difficult to talk to them. Xingdi was an enthusiastic person, and in order to help me understand the situation, she rushed to the early shift several times and mixed in with their team, intending to inquire about some internal information from them. However, when the bonded laborers looked at her clothes and sized up her identity, they quickly became "alert." Some people did not say a word at all, and some even regarded her as a "busybody" and gave her a disgusted look. From this, it can be seen that in that situation, it was very difficult to truly hear what they wanted to say in their hearts and to understand the pain in their hearts.
    Regarding their living conditions, everything I could investigate at that time has been written in that report. This is a "reportage," not a novel, so I tried to be truthful when I wrote it, and there was no fiction or exaggeration. Their labor intensity, their labor and living conditions, and the wage system at the time were all investigated as realistically as possible. Therefore, everything that seems unbelievable to today's worker comrades was an ironclad fact at that time.
    Looking back now, what impressed me most at the time was the close combination of imperialism, feudal forces, and gangster secret agents. In order to oppress and exploit these thousands of lonely and helpless bonded laborers, Japanese imperialists, the Public Works Department, foremen, bosses, gang leaders, Kuomintang secret agents, and even local thugs completely formed a united front. In this place, there was neither so-called national sovereignty nor government laws, let alone living security and personal freedom. After liberation, at a grievance-airing meeting during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, I heard an elderly female worker from a cotton mill say, "You say that we work as cattle and horses for the capitalists, but in fact, we are not even as good as cattle and horses. We are insects like flies and mosquitoes. It is not surprising at all that the Japanese boss and the foreman beat a worker to death, just like stepping on an ant on the ground." This is the truth, not at all false.
    After liberation, I went to see the Caoyang New Village and the Kongjiang New Village in Shanghai, and I also went to see the workers' hospital. Seeing these, I don't know what other people feel, but I always naturally associate them with the lives of bonded laborers. The image of bonded laborers makes soft-hearted people cry when they think about it. Words like pale and thin and skin and bones cannot describe their real situation. There are very few bonded laborers without diseases, and the most common are lung disease, athlete's foot, and skin diseases. Some bonded laborers' feet are already swollen as thick as bowls, and they still stand next to the machines day and night. Last winter, I visited a female workers' dormitory in Beijing and saw books, newspapers, snow cream, perfume, etc. by their beds. I felt happy for them. When I first mixed in with the group of bonded laborers to observe, what I could not stand the most was the unpleasant stench. At that time, it was the season of plum rain in Shanghai in May, and it was impossible for bonded laborers to take a bath, wash their hair, and change their clothes all year round. Please imagine what it was like!
    I wrote that "The Bonded Laborer" in 1935 (it was published in the spring of 1936), which is twenty-four years ago from now. Calculating this way, these are probably already "historical relics" for today's young workers. In that tragic era, today's young people were not yet born. Then, I think, looking back to know a little about the past will make you feel more deeply the happiness of being a worker in the Mao Zedong era. The society of cannibalism is gone forever, and the era of workers being cattle and horses and insects for capitalists is gone forever, but we must remember: to drive away imperialism and to overthrow this cannibalistic social system, our ancestors paid countless lives, sweat, and tears. Happiness cannot be obtained without a price. For today's happiness, for a happier future, loving the Party, loving socialism, and contributing our strength to the socialist-communist New China should be the responsibility of our younger generation.

    从“包身工”引起的回忆
    夏衍
    1927年，我的组织关系在上海闸北区第三街道支部。那时，我做过一个很短时期的工会工作，认识了一些在纱厂工作的朋友。后来工作调动，就离开了。1929年年底，我住在沪东唐山路业广里，因为这是工人区，所以有几位做工人运动的同志还常常到我家里来“落脚”——把一套蓝布工人服放在我家里，他们穿了长衫或者西装到我这里来，换上工人装束到工厂去，工作完了之后再到我这里来换回原来的衣服。从这些同志的谈话中，我知道了“包身工”制度，和这些年轻女孩子们的非人的生活。一年多以后，上海艺术剧社被解散，我们组织了流动演剧队到工厂去演出，为了找关系，我又和一个过去认识的、在基督教青年会办的工人夜校里担任教员的同志接上了关系（她就是我后来在“包身工余话”里写的那位冯先生）。她告诉了我许多关于包身工的事情。“一·二八”战争后，沈西苓同志要写一个以上海女工为题材的电影剧本，我就把包身工的材料告诉了他。这就是后来由明星公司拍成的“女性的呐喊”。这是第一部写包身工的文艺作品，但是一方面由于我们对这方面的体会不深，生活不够熟悉，同时由于当时的环境限制，拍成之后又遭到了电影审查官的一再删剪，这部影片的成绩并不很好。但是，由于要写这部电影，我们又重新搜集了一些包身工的材料，了解得多了一些，包身工的悲惨生活更使我们这批知识分子感到“灵魂的震动”。我也看过不少描写女工生活的文艺作品，在日本的时候，我也看到过在资本主义世界里一致认为生活水平最低、劳动条件最坏的日本的纺织女工的生活，可是，拿日本女工来和包身工一比，那就是天堂和地狱了。这时候我才知道，在二十世纪的帝国主义经营的工厂里，原来还公然地保存着奴隶制度。我感到愤怒，我觉得非把这个人间地狱揭发出来不可，于是我决心写一篇小说，开始进一步的了解包身工的生活，但是后来因为工作忙，就搁下了。直到1935年，上海党组织遭到了又一次很大的破坏，我们文化方面的几个主要负责人都被捕了，组织上要我暂时隐蔽起来，我就利用这个机会，开始了有关包身工的材料的搜集。
    经过“沪东公社”（进步分子利用基督教青年会的机构，在杨树浦办的一个以工人夜校为中心的服务组织）的同志们的介绍，我认识了一位在日本内外棉纱厂做工的青年团员杏弟。和她谈了几次之后，觉得真的要了解包身工的生活，单凭搜集材料是不行的，非得实地视察不可。我找到了一位在日本纱厂当职员的中学时代的同学，到包身工工作的车间去视察了几次，对她们的劳动条件有了一些了解，可是要懂得“带工头”对包身工的管理制度，她们的生活情况，那是非得亲自到包身工们住宿的工房去调查不可的。对现在的年轻工人来说，那种情况恐怕是已经很难于理解也很难于相信的了，在当时，包身工住的工房，实际上是一所管理得十分严密的监狱。包身工的工房，是由日本警察、巡捕、带工头手下的流氓紧紧地封锁着的，他们为了防止这群“奴隶劳工”和外界接触，任何“外头人”是不能走进这个禁区的。在“包身工”里我说过，这些“包身工”是“罐装了的劳动力”，资本家把她们密封起来，不让她们和外面的空气接触，这些话一点也没有夸张。为了突破这种封锁，我得到杏弟的帮助，混进去过两次，但是在这之后，就被带工头雇用的“下手”们盯住了。对于这种观察特别困难的，是包身工们一清早就进厂做工，晚上才回工房，所以要看到她们上班下班的生活，非在清早和晚间不可。当时我住在麦特赫斯德路（现泰兴路），离开杨树浦很远，这样，为了要在早上五点钟以前赶到杨树浦，就得半夜三点多钟起身，走十几里路，才能看到她们上班的情景。这样，我从3月初到5月，足足做了两个多月的“夜工”，才比较详细地观察到了一些她们的日常生活。由于她们受着三重四重的压迫，遭受过无数的磨难，所以这些小姑娘们是不敢轻易和人讲话的，不仅像我们这样的人，即使同厂做工的“外头工人”，要和她们讲话也是很困难的。杏弟是一个热心人，她为了帮助我了解情况，曾经几次赶上早班，混在她们队伍里面，打算向她们探听一些内部的情况，可是，当包身工们看了一下她的服装，打量了一下她的身分之后，很快地就“警惕”了，有的人根本不吭声，有的人甚至将她看成了“包打听”，用憎恶的眼光看她一眼。由此可见，在那种情况下，要真真听到她们心里想说的话，要了解她们心底的苦痛，是很不容易的。
    关于她们的生活情况，根据当时我能够调查到的，都已经写在那篇报告里了。这是一篇“报告文学”，不是一篇小说，所以我写的时候力求真实，一点也没有虚构和夸张。她们的劳动强度，她们的劳动和生活条件，当时的工资制度，我都尽可能的作了实事求是的调查，因此，在今天的工人同志们看来似乎是不能相信的一切，在当时却是铁一般的事实。
    现在回想起来，当时使我特别印象深刻的，是帝国主义、封建势力和流氓特务这一切恶势力的紧密结合。为了压迫和榨取这成千上万的孤苦无告的包身工，日本帝国主义者、工部局、带工头、老板、帮口头子、国民党特务、以至当地的地痞流氓，完全结成一条统一战线。在这个地方，既没有所谓国家主权、政府法律、更谈不上生活保障和人身自由。解放之后，在镇反运动的一次诉苦大会上，我听到过一个老年的纱厂女工说：“你们说，我们给资本家做牛马，其实呀，连牛马也不如，我们是苍蝇、蚊子一样的虫豸。东洋人老板和带工头打死一个工人，好像在地上踏死一个蚂蚁一样，一点也不算稀奇。”这是实话，一点也不假的。
    解放之后，我去看过上海的曹杨新村、控江新村，我也曾去看过工人医院。看到这些，不知别人是什么感觉，我却总会很自然地联系起包身工的生活。包身工的形象，想起来就会使软心肠的人流眼泪。什么面黄肌瘦、骨瘦如柴这些话，都是不能形容她们的真实情况的，没有病的包身工是很少的，最多的是肺病、脚气病、皮肤病。有些包身工的两只脚已经肿得像碗口一样粗了，还是成天成夜的站在机器旁边工作。去年冬天我在北京参观了一处女工宿舍，看到她们床边有书籍、报刊、雪花膏、香水等，我替她们感到了幸福。最初我混在包身工群中观察的时候，最使我受不了的是那种难闻的臭气。那时正是上海的5月黄梅天季节，包身工们是成年累月不可能洗澡、洗头和换衣服的，请你们设想一下，这是一种什么滋味！
    我写那篇“包身工”是在1935年（发表是在1936年春），离开现在已经二十四年了，这样计算一下，对现在的青年工人来说，大概这些都已经是“历史上的陈迹”了。在那个悲惨的时代，今天的青年人还没有出世。那么，我想，回头来知道一点过去的事情，就会更深刻地感到作为一个毛泽东时代的工人的幸福。人吃人的社会，已经一去不复返了，工人给资本家当牛马、当虫豸的时代，已经一去不复返了，可是我们得记住：要赶走帝国主义，要推翻这个人吃人的社会制度，我们的先人曾付出了无数的生命、血汗和眼泪。幸福，不是无代价可以得来的。为了今天的幸福，为了更幸福的将来，爱党、爱社会主义、为社会主义——共产主义的新中国而贡献出自己的力量，应该是我们青年一代的责任。
