    Another Victory for the Anti-Imperialist Struggle of the Iraqi People
    Britain Forced to Announce Withdrawal of Air Force from Iraq
    Xinhua News Agency, 31st - London Dispatch: The British government was yesterday forced to announce the withdrawal of a Royal Air Force detachment stationed at the Habbaniyah base in Iraq.

    This British air force detachment was stationed at this Iraqi air base under a "special agreement" signed in 1955 with the traitorous Said regime of Iraq, to help the Said regime train its army to suppress the Iraqi people. The base currently has 300 British military personnel.

    In a statement issued yesterday, the British Foreign Office reluctantly acknowledged that "as a result of Iraq's decision on March 24 to withdraw from the Baghdad Pact, the special agreement concluded between Her Majesty's Government and the Iraqi Government on April 4, 1955, has also been abolished." The statement said that after negotiations, "the two governments have agreed that the British Air Force detachment and its supplies should be withdrawn as soon as possible."

    伊拉克人民反帝斗争的又一胜利
    英被迫宣布将撤出驻伊空军
    新华社31日讯　伦敦消息：英国政府昨天被迫宣布把它驻在伊拉克的哈巴尼雅基地的一个皇家空军支队撤出伊拉克。
    英国这个空军支队是根据1955年同伊拉克的赛义德卖国政权签订的一个“特别协定”而驻扎在这个伊拉克的空军基地上，帮助赛义德政权训练军队来镇压伊拉克人民。这个基地现在有英国军事人员三百人。
    英国外交部在昨天发表的一个声明中无可奈何地承认，“由于伊拉克3月24日决定退出巴格达条约，女王政府和伊拉克政府1955年4月4日缔结的特别协定也废除了。”声明说，在经过谈判之后，“两国政府一致认为，英国空军支队及其供应物资应尽早撤离”。
