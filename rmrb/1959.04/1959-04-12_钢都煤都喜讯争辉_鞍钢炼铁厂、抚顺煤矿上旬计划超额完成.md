　　Anshan Iron and Steel Works and Fushun Coal Mine Exceed Upper Ten-Day Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 11th—The Anshan Iron and Steel Works, with its six large blast furnaces, exceeded its pig iron production plan for the first ten days of April. The factory's overall production level has also significantly improved, with the average daily output for the first ten days of April increasing by 9.79% compared to the same period in March.
    Entering April, the factory's competition movement intensified. The blast furnaces sought out targets, issued challenges to each other, and learned from and caught up with the advanced. The No. 3 blast furnace chose the No. 9 blast furnace, which had the highest utilization coefficient in March, as its competition target. They studied the experience of the No. 9 blast furnace, strengthened operations inside and outside the furnace, and increased the blast furnace utilization coefficient to 1.973, thus producing 2,070 tons more pig iron in the first ten days of April than in the first ten days of March.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th—After fulfilling their plans for each ten-day period in March, the workers of the Fushun Coal Mine exceeded their coal production plan for the first ten days of April by 3.9%.
    The coal production plan for the second quarter of the Fushun Coal Mine is even larger than that of the first quarter. In order to quickly launch a new leap forward, the Fushun Municipal Committee held a mass leap forward conference from April 6th to 10th, adopting the method of going straight to the grassroots and mobilizing cadres and the masses together, delivering tasks and measures to all employees at once, and mobilizing the masses to speak out freely and discuss the experiences of the first quarter and the plans for the second quarter. After discussions, the broad masses of workers put forward more than 9,000 suggestions for improving management and innovating production technology. This not only promoted current production but also enabled the mines to formulate more advanced plans for the second quarter.
    The mine leaders arranged two fronts, one focusing on formulating measures and plans, and the other organizing dedicated personnel to lead production, ensuring that there was command in every shift and management everywhere, so that raw coal production steadily increased. In the first ten days of April, the workers of the West Open-pit Mine fulfilled their daily production plans and continuously broke through the highest levels of March in terms of stripping, loading, and rock blasting. On the 8th, the stripping workers created a record high of more than 167,000 cubic meters of stripping volume.

　　鞍钢炼铁厂、抚顺煤矿上旬计划超额完成
    新华社鞍山11日电　鞍钢炼铁厂有六座大型高炉，超额完成了4月上旬的炼铁计划。全厂的生产水平也有显著提高，4月上旬的平均日产量，比3月份同时期增长9.79％。
    进入4月，这个厂的竞赛运动更加深入，各高炉间，自找对象，互下战表，学先进，赶先进。三号高炉选择的竞赛对象，是3月份高炉利用系数最高的九号高炉。他们学习九号高炉的经验，加强了炉内外的操作，把高炉利用系数提高到一点九七三，因此使4月上旬比3月上旬多生产了两千零七十吨生铁。
    新华社沈阳11日电　抚顺煤矿职工继3月份旬旬完成计划之后，又超额3.9％完成了4月上旬煤炭生产计划。
    抚顺煤矿第二季度的煤炭计划产量，比第一季度有更大增长。为了迅速掀起新的跃进高潮，抚顺市委在4月6日到10日举行了全民跃进大会，采取一竿子插到底、干部和群众一起动员的办法，把任务、措施一次下达到全体职工中去，发动群众大鸣大放，讨论第一季度经验和第二季度计划。广大职工经过鸣放讨论，提出了九千多件改进管理和革新生产技术的建议。这样不仅推动了当前生产，也使各矿制订出了第二季度的更为先进的计划。
    各矿领导安排两条战线，一面紧抓制订措施计划，一面组织专人负责领导生产，作到了班班有指挥，处处有人管，使原煤生产步步上升。西露天矿的职工在4月份头十天里，按日完成生产计划，并且在剥离、装车、崩岩处理方面连续突破3月份的最高水平，剥离职工8日曾创剥离量十六万七千多立方公尺的历史最高纪录。
