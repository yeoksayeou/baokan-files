    Nanjing Wulao New Village
    Clean on all six sides, fragrant with flowers and trees for ten li.
    Relying on the leadership of the Party, creating paradise with our own hands. Wulao Village was originally a slum area, with accumulated water and foul odors, and swarms of mosquitoes and flies. People often lived in water, and epidemics occurred frequently. Starting in 1952, the residents put forward the slogan of rebuilding their homes with their own hands, which was supported by the Party and government. Thatched houses were gradually turned into tile-roofed houses, roads were widened and paved, drainage pipes were installed, flowers, fruits and trees were planted, and small pavilions were arranged, along with an art gallery. Every household is very clean, and although doors are set, they are often open for visitors to see. Various factories are run in the village, and most women are employed. In addition to nurseries, there are also community-run primary schools with more than 400 students. In the past, the area was ridiculed because its stench spread far and wide, using the ironic phrase "a gust of wind brings fragrance for ten li." Now, various fragrant flowers and trees are in clusters, truly making it fragrant for ten li.

    南京五老新村
    清洁六面光，花木十里香。
    依靠党领导，双手创天堂。五老村原来是棚户区，积水污臭，蚊蝇丛集。人常居水中，疫病经常发生。从1952年开始，居民提出凭双手重建家园的口号，得到党政方面的支持。草房逐渐改成瓦房，道路拓宽铺平，下装排水管，栽植花果草木，布置小小池亭，且有画廊。家家户户都很整洁，门虽设而常开，随人参观。村中办各种工厂，妇女大多就业。托儿所而外，还有民办小学，学生四百多人。从前其地受人讥讽，因为臭气远布，用反语说它“一阵风来十里香”。现在各种芳香花木成丛，真将十里闻香了。
