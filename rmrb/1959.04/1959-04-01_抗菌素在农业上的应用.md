Application of Antibiotics in Agriculture
Liu Shouchu, Institute of Soil and Fertilizer, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

Plant diseases have always been a significant factor affecting yield improvement. The Party and the government strongly support the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, and have directed the application of antagonistic bacteria and antibiotics in agriculture. Antibiotic fertilizers have been widely promoted in rural areas across the country, and corresponding developments have also been made in the use of antibiotics to prevent and control plant diseases and stimulate crop growth. The application of antibiotics in agriculture has had a good start.

Antibiotics have the ability to inhibit or kill other microorganisms.

The term "antibiotic" is no longer unfamiliar in rural areas. The traditional definition of an antibiotic is: "a chemical substance produced by a microorganism during its metabolism that has the ability to inhibit the growth and activity of other microorganisms, or even kill other kinds of microorganisms." However, in terms of the sources of antibiotics, this definition is no longer very suitable. The sources of antibiotics are no longer limited to microbial formation; antibiotics can also be obtained from higher plant bodies and animal tissues. Some antibiotics can also be artificially synthesized by chemical methods. However, the vast majority of antibiotics are still derived from various microorganisms (including the three major types of microorganisms: bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi), with actinomycetes forming the most antibiotics; 50% to 60% of actinomycetes can produce antibiotics.

Antibiotics are different from antibiotic fertilizers. Antibiotic fertilizers directly utilize antagonistic microorganisms, inoculate them into special culture substrates, and then inoculate them into the soil, allowing them to grow and reproduce under natural conditions, forming antibiotic substances and producing the effects of preventing diseases and stimulating growth. Antibiotic fertilizers are only preventive in nature for plant diseases. Antibiotics refer to effective chemical substances formed directly by antagonistic microorganisms, including crude crystalline and pure crystalline antibiotics and antibiotic solutions, which do not contain living microorganisms. The biggest advantage of antibiotics is that they can be used not only for the prevention of plant diseases but also directly for the treatment of plant diseases.

The microorganisms that produce antibiotics, whether bacteria, actinomycetes, or fungi, mainly originate from the soil. However, they can also be obtained from compost, manure, dust, air, river and pond mud, and water. According to the research of Soviet scientists, every gram of soil can contain billions of bacteria and hundreds of thousands of fungal and actinomycete spores. These many microorganisms live together in the soil in a very complex relationship, including symbiotic and mutualistic relationships. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia grow on the roots of higher plants and leguminous plants, and plant roots provide mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia with a place to live. They jointly absorb nutrients, complement each other's lives, and share the same interests, which is a symbiotic relationship. Cellulose bacteria in the soil decompose cellulose to form sugars and organic acids. Autotrophic nitrogen-fixing bacteria utilize the decomposition products of cellulose bacteria as their living materials. At the same time, the activity of autotrophic nitrogen-fixing bacteria fixes nitrogen in the air, which can also improve the life of cellulose bacteria. This is a mutualistic relationship. In addition to these two types of living relationships, there is also a widespread antagonistic relationship in the soil, which is the source of antibiotics.

The antagonistic relationship of microorganisms in the soil is caused by extremely complex factors. Many phenomena still lack clear explanations in modern science. The competition for nutrients is a common phenomenon. The adaptability of moisture, air, temperature, and pH are all controlling factors for the growth and decline of microorganisms in the soil. But the most important thing is the antagonistic relationship. In the process of life, some microorganisms can secrete a substance in their metabolism in order to compete for survival, which can inhibit or kill their competitors. This secreted active substance, extracted by precise chemical methods, becomes an antibiotic. Microorganisms with true antagonistic effects have both broad and specific types. Antibiotics produced by broad-type microorganisms can inhibit or kill a variety of microorganisms; antibiotics formed by specific-type microorganisms are only suitable for inhibiting a specific microorganism. However, one microorganism can also form several different antibiotics.

Antibiotics can prevent and control plant diseases and stimulate the growth of livestock and poultry.

Developing antagonistic microorganisms in the soil to control the effect of plant pathogens in the soil is noteworthy, especially for fungi. Fungi are the most numerous and serious pathogens that harm crops in our country. These pathogenic fungi often enter the soil from diseased crop residues or products. Obligate parasitic pathogenic fungi can harm a smaller range of crops and can survive in the soil for a short time. Facultative parasitic pathogenic fungi can cause disease to a variety of crops. These pathogenic fungi can survive for a long time because they can become saprophytes in the soil. Applying antagonistic microorganisms to the soil to prevent and control crop diseases, if the applied antagonistic bacteria can obtain the proper reproduction in the soil, will achieve the expected effect. In this regard, the use of antibiotic fertilizers has achieved some success.

In the past twenty years, antibiotics have achieved great success in the treatment of human diseases. Particularly noteworthy is the bright avenue pointed out by Academician Krasilnikov, a Soviet microbiologist: applying antibiotics to the prevention and control of plant diseases. According to Academician Krasilnikov's experiments, antibiotics can not only enter the various organs of the above-ground tissues from the roots of plants, but also enter the interior of the plant body by foliar spraying and seed soaking. This indicates the most favorable conditions for the prevention and control of plant diseases with antibiotics. Penicillin loses its therapeutic effect after staying in the human body for 24 hours, but antibiotics can remain in the plant body for six to seven days or longer. This illustrates the persistence of antibiotic effects. Soviet scientists have used antibiotics to control cotton angular leaf spot, fruit tree diseases, and other crop diseases.

The application of biological agents such as antibiotics can also stimulate crop growth, increase and promote seed germination.

Antibiotics can also stimulate the growth of piglets and chicks. Soviet scientists have successfully used antibiotics to raise piglets, fatten chicks, and increase the egg-laying ability of hens. According to Academician Krasilnikov's experiments, feeding livestock with antibiotics such as chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, and penicillin can increase body weight by an average of 15% to 30%. Professor Yermolyeva's experiments have shown that applying antibiotics to cultivate chicks increases the growth index by an average of 10% to 15% in the sixty days of cultivation compared to the control.

Antibiotics have a broad prospect in agricultural applications.

During the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, under the correct leadership of the Party, through the efforts of everyone, the Institute of Soil and Fertilizer of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences extracted two kinds of antibiotics from antagonistic actinomycetes. Among them, the antibiotic of actinomycete No. 1013 has a significant effect on cotton seedling blight and Verticillium wilt, and potato late blight. In vitro tests also showed a significant inhibitory effect on rice blast and sweet potato black rot, and can also be tested for other fungal or bacterial diseases. Spraying with a 1:1000 dilution of antibiotic No. 1013 can increase the disease resistance effect by 91.2% compared with the control for the prevention and control of cotton seedling blight. Inoculating the soil with a shake-cultured solution of antibiotic No. 1013 can increase the disease resistance effect by 65.9% compared with the control for the prevention and control of seedling blight. Spraying cotton plants infected with Verticillium wilt with a 1:1000 dilution of antibiotic No. 1013, the growth potential of the diseased plants recovered significantly after a week, and the diseased leaves gradually unfolded. The spraying effect is best in the early stage of the disease, and the spraying effect is reduced in the later stage. Applying a 1:2000 dilution of antibiotic No. 1013 to prevent and control potato late blight has a better disease resistance effect than spraying with 0.15% copper sulfate, which is equivalent to the effect of Bordeaux mixture. Antibiotic No. 1013 not only has a significant effect on the treatment of crop diseases, but also can promote seed germination, increase germination rate, and stimulate seedling growth. Antibiotic No. 1013 has a significant stimulating effect on the growth of Chinese cabbage. The fresh weight of plants with added antibiotic solution increased by more than one time compared with the control, and the dry weight increased by nearly one time.

The extraction of crystalline antibiotic No. 1013 cannot be widely produced in rural areas due to limitations in technical equipment and technical conditions. After the Party put forward the call to break superstitions and liberate the mind, the Institute of Soil and Fertilizer strengthened the research on the local method of manufacturing antibiotics. At present, simple manufacturing methods have been successfully researched, namely cake soil culture method, static culture method, and cotton solid culture method, and a method similar to ventilation culture has been obtained. It gets rid of the shackles of shake flask ventilation chemical extraction. Using these methods, as long as there is simple sterilization equipment, it can be produced in large quantities in rural areas. In order to improve quality, increase effect, and facilitate storage and transportation, refined crystalline antibiotics are still the current work direction.

The Institute of Animal Husbandry of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences also conducted experiments on adding chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, and penicillin to feed and feeding crossbred Yorkshire pigs. At the beginning, the weight of the pigs was 17 kilograms. After 20 weeks, the weight of the pigs fed with antibiotics increased compared to the control group pigs. Chlortetracycline increased by 12%, oxytetracycline by 11%, and penicillin had no effect. In the experiment with Dingxian pigs, the weight of the pigs at the beginning was 10.6 kg. After 23 weeks, the average weight of the pigs in the control group was 37 kg, the chlortetracycline group was 50 kg, and the oxytetracycline group was 42 kg. The effect of antibiotics in stimulating growth can increase body weight by up to 35%.

Research on the prevention and control of crop diseases with antibiotics should be strengthened, especially research on the most serious diseases that endanger grain crop yield increase, such as wheat rust, rice blast, and potato late blight. Under the leadership of the Party, overcoming these diseases in a short period of time is entirely possible.

    抗菌素在农业上的应用
    中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所　刘守初
    农作物的病害向来是严重影响产量提高的因素。党和政府大力支持农作物病虫害的防治工作，指示了在农业上应用抗生菌和抗菌素的方向。抗菌素肥料在全国农村中普遍推广了，抗菌素在防治农作物病害和刺激作物生长方面，也有了相应的发展。抗菌素在农业上的应用，已经有了良好的开端。
  抗菌素具有抑制或杀死其他微生物
    的性能
    抗菌素这一名词，在各地农村中已经不是生疏的了。抗菌素按照以往的定义系指：“微生物在它新陈代谢的过程中所产生的一种具有抑制他种微生物生长及活动，甚至杀死其他种微生物性能的化学物质。”但是目前就抗菌素的来源来说，这个定义已经不很适合。抗菌素的来源已经不局限于微生物的形成，从高等植物机体和动物组织中也可取得抗菌素。有一些抗菌素还可用化学的方法人工合成。不过绝大部分的抗菌素，仍然是从各种微生物（包括细菌、放线菌和真菌三大类型的微生物）得来，其中以放线菌形成的抗菌素最多，50％到60％的放线菌都能产生抗菌素。
    抗菌素不同于抗菌素肥料。抗菌素肥料是直接利用抗生性微生物，接种在特备的培养基质内，再接种在土壤中，任其在自然情况下生长繁殖，形成抗生物质，产生防治病害和刺激生长的效果。抗菌素肥料对农作物病害只是一种预防的性质。抗菌素是指直接利用抗生性微生物所形成的有效性化学物质，包括粗结晶和纯结晶的抗菌素和抗生素溶液，其中不含有生活的微生物。抗菌素的最大优点，不仅可以应用于农作物病害的预防，还可以直接用于农作物病害的治疗。
    产生抗菌素的微生物，不管是细菌、放线菌或真菌，主要的来源都是土壤。但也可从堆肥、厩肥、尘埃、空气、河塘泥及水中得到。依据苏联科学家的研究，每克土壤中能含几十亿个细菌和几十万个真菌和放线菌孢子。这许多微生物聚居在土壤中，是以一种极复杂的关系共同生活的，其中包括共生的关系和互生的关系。例如菌根真菌和根瘤菌，它们生长在高等植物和豆科植物的根上，植物根给菌根真菌和根瘤菌以居住的场所。它们共同摄取养分，生活互补，利害相同，是一种共生的关系。土壤中的纤维素细菌把纤维素分解形成了糖分和有机酸。自生固氮细菌则利用纤维素细菌的分解产物，作为它们的生活资料。同时自生固氮细菌的活动，固定了空气中的氮素，也能改善纤维素细菌的生活。它们是一种互生关系。土壤中除了这两种生活关系外，还广泛存在着一种对抗关系，这种关系就是产生抗菌素的来源。
    微生物在土壤中的对抗关系，是一种极复杂的因素造成的。有许多现象现代科学中还缺乏明确的解释。营养物质的竞争，是一种普遍存在的现象。水分、空气、温度、酸碱度的适应性，都是土壤中微生物消长的控制因素。但是最重要的是对抗关系。某一些微生物在它的生活过程中，为了生存竞争，在新陈代谢作用中能够分泌出一种物质，可以抑制或杀死它的竞争者，这种分泌的活性物质，用精密的化学方法提出来就成了抗菌素。具有真正对抗作用的微生物，有广泛的与专一的两种类型，广泛类型微生物所产生的抗菌素，可以抑制或杀死多种微生物；专一类型微生物所形成的抗菌素，只适用于抑制某一种特殊的微生物。但是一种微生物也可形成几种不同的抗菌素。
  抗菌素能防治农作物病害，刺激家
    畜家禽生长
    发展土壤中对抗性微生物，以控制土壤中农作物病原菌的作用，是值得注意的，特别是对真菌。真菌是为害我国农作物最多也最严重的病原菌。这些病原真菌又经常从得病的作物残体或产品中进入土壤内。专性寄生的病原真菌，能侵害的农作物范围较小，在土壤中能够生存的时间也很短。兼性寄生的病原真菌，有一些能使多种作物遭受病害。这些病原真菌由于能够在土壤中成为腐生菌，生存的时间很长。应用对抗性微生物加入土壤中，防治农作物病害，如果施用的抗生菌在土壤中能够得到应有的繁殖，是会取得所预期的效果的，在这方面，利用抗菌素肥料，已经取得一些成就。
    二十年来抗菌素在人类疾病的治疗上，取得了巨大的成就。特别值得重视的，是苏联微生物学家克拉西尔尼科夫院士指出了一条光明大道：把抗菌素应用于农作物病害的防治。依据克拉西尔尼科夫院士的试验证明，抗菌素不仅可以从植物的根部进入地上组织的各个器官，还可用叶面喷射和浸渍种子的方法，进入植物机体的内部。这就指明了抗菌素在农作物病害的防治上的最有利的条件。青霉素在人体内停留二十四小时，就失去了治疗的效果，但抗菌素在植物机体内，可以保持六至七天之久或更多的时间。这就说明了抗菌素效果的持久性。苏联科学家曾经利用抗菌素防治了棉花角斑病、果树病害以及其他种农作物的病害。
    应用抗菌素这一类的生物制剂，还可刺激农作物生长，提高和促进种子的萌发。
    抗菌素还可以刺激仔猪和雏鸡的生长。苏联科学家成功地应用抗菌素培育仔猪、肥育雏鸡以及提高母鸡的产卵能力。依据克拉西尔尼科夫院士的试验，应用金霉素、土霉素、青霉素等抗菌素喂饲家畜，平均可增加体重15％—30％。耶耳莫利耶娃教授的试验证明，应用抗菌素培育雏鸡，培育的六十天中，比对照增加的生长指数，平均提高了10％—15％。
    抗菌素在农业上的应用有着广阔的前途
    在农业生产大跃进同时，中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所在党的正确领导下，经过大家的努力，从拮抗性放线菌中提出了两种抗菌素。其中1013号放线菌的抗菌素，对于棉花立枯和黄萎病、马铃薯晚疫病，具有显著的效果。室内测定对稻瘟病及甘薯黑斑病，也有显著的抑制病菌作用，还可试用于其他种真菌性病害或细菌病害。用1013号抗菌素1∶1000倍稀释液喷射，对棉花立枯病的防治，比对照提高抗病效果达91.2％。1013号抗菌素的摇培溶液接种土壤，对立枯病的防治，比对照提高抗病效果达65.9％。应用1013号抗菌素1∶1000倍的稀释液喷射黄萎病菌侵染的棉花植株，一星期后病株的生长势显著恢复，病叶亦逐渐舒展。发病初期喷射效果最佳，末期喷射效果降低。应用1013号抗菌素1∶2000倍稀释液，防治马铃薯晚疫病，抗病效果优于应用0.15％硫酸铜喷射，相当于波尔多液的效果。1013号抗菌素不仅对农作物病害的治疗有显著的效果，还能促进种子萌发，提高发芽率，并刺激幼苗生长。1013号抗菌素对白菜的生长，有显著的刺激作用，加抗菌素液的植株比对照，鲜物量增加超过一倍，干物量增加将近一倍。
    1013号结晶抗菌素的提制，由于技术设备和技术件条的限制，不能在农村中普遍生产。党提出破除迷信，解放思想的号召后，土壤肥料研究所加强了土法制造抗菌素的研究。目前已研究成功简单的制造方法，即饼土培养法、静止培养法、棉花固体培养法，并得到近似于通气培养的方法。摆脱了摇瓶通气化学提炼的束缚。运用这些方法，只要有简单的灭菌设备，在农村中即可大量生产。为了提高质量，增加效果，便于储藏运输，精制的结晶抗菌素，仍然是现时工作的方向。
    中国农业科学院畜牧研究所还进行了应用金霉素、土霉素和青霉素加入饲料，喂饲杂种大白猪的试验。开始时猪的体重为十七公斤，二十周后喂饲抗菌素的猪比对照组猪的体重增加，金霉素是12％，土霉素11％，青霉素无效果。抗菌素对于定县猪的试验，开始时猪的体重为十点六公斤，二十三周后对照组的猪，平均体重为三十七公斤，金霉素组的猪为五十公斤，土霉素组为四十二公斤。抗菌素刺激生长的效果，体重增加最高可达35％。
    应该加强抗菌素防治农作物病害的研究，特别是对小麦锈病、稻瘟病、马铃薯晚疫病等危害粮食作物增产的最严重病害的研究。在党的领导下，短期内克服这些病害，是完全可以的。
