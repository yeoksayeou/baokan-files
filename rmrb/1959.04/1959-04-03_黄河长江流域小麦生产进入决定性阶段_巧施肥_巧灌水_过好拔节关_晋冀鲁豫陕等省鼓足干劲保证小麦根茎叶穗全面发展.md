Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: Wheat in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins is growing vigorously, with some already at the jointing stage and others entering it. In order to successfully navigate this crucial phase, hundreds of thousands of wheat field management workers in provinces like Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Anhui have launched a new high tide of intense efforts to conquer the jointing stage. They are skillfully applying fertilizer and irrigating, striving to ensure that every wheat seedling has an ear, every plant has large ears, every ear has many grains, every grain is plump, every mu yields abundantly, and every plot achieves a bumper harvest.

Currently, wheat crops in various regions are growing luxuriantly and lushly, displaying a vibrant green hue, surpassing the quality of any previous year. South of the Yellow River, wheat seedlings are over a foot tall, with most already closing the rows.

The jointing stage is a critical period for wheat growth, decisively influencing the development of roots, stems, leaves, and ears. The number of effective tillers, the sturdiness of the stems, the size of the ears, the density of spikelets, and whether the grains are numerous and heavy are all closely related to how well the jointing stage is managed. Therefore, various regions have increased their efforts, adjusted their labor force, and organized larger teams than in the previous stage to intensely and skillfully manage the wheat fields during the jointing stage. Currently, Henan Province has 6.4 million people dedicated to meticulously managing wheat fields daily, with a daily fertilization progress of 2.79 million mu. 80% of the wheat fields have been fertilized twice, and 60% have been fertilized three times. In Hebei Province, 4.5 million wheat field management workers are intensifying their efforts to conquer the jointing stage by adding water and fertilizer on top of universal fertilization, watering, and cultivation. The number of specialized wheat field management personnel in Anhui Province has increased from the original 2.34 million to the current 3.82 million.

The most fundamental measure for successfully navigating the wheat jointing stage is to ensure that the wheat is adequately nourished and hydrated once again. Various regions have prepared water for the wheat jointing stage, and areas with insufficient preparations are intensifying their efforts. As of March 20th, Henan Province had repaired 237,000 small channels, 7,500 small reservoirs, over 30,000 ponds, weirs, and dams, dug over 7,000 wells, and excavated over 14,000 springs for wheat field irrigation. The province's wheat irrigation area has increased by 10 million mu compared to the initial watering after winter.

Many regions have also prepared fertilizer for the wheat jointing stage, especially phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. Employees of Shandong Province's 44,000 local fertilizer plants are working day and night to produce local fertilizer for wheat, and have already produced over 70 billion jin. Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, is intensifying its efforts to accumulate and manufacture the phosphorus and potassium fertilizers needed for wheat. Inspired by the slogan "Accumulate sufficient phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to feed the three wheat fields," farmers have dredged over 36,000 dan of snails from ditches, ponds, and rivers. The county's 1,200 local fertilizer plants and over 29,000 various types of fumigation kilns have also rushed to produce large quantities of local fertilizer.

In the battle to conquer the jointing stage, various regions are paying particular attention to strengthening the field management of large-area high-yield fields and third-class seedlings. Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi provinces all require the elimination of third-class wheat seedlings during the jointing stage. The method is to water and topdress simultaneously, especially with fast-acting fertilizers containing more nitrogen, to promote third-class seedlings to catch up with first and second-class seedlings.

Various regions have also made preparations for disease and pest prevention, frost prevention, and other tasks. Many areas in Shaanxi Province have organized a strong team to prevent and control wheat stripe rust, determined to eliminate stripe rust before the jointing stage.

This year's wheat field management work is becoming increasingly meticulous and solid. As wheat enters the jointing stage, many counties and communes are universally organizing inspection teams comprised of cadres, experienced farmers, technicians, and commune members to conduct thorough inspections and evaluations in the fields, classifying and ranking fields and seedlings one by one, and implementing differentiated management. Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, organized a 10,000-person inspection team to go deep into the fields, inspecting seedlings while mobilizing the masses to formulate specific measures and carry out competitions, thereby improving the quality of wheat field management.

While fiercely attacking the wheat jointing stage, various regions are also actively making all preparations for the subsequent stages of wheat heading, flowering, grain filling, and harvesting.

    黄河长江流域小麦生产进入决定性阶段
    巧施肥　巧灌水　过好拔节关
    晋冀鲁豫陕等省鼓足干劲保证小麦根茎叶穗全面发展
    据新华社2日讯　长江、黄河流域各省生长旺盛的小麦有的已经拔节，有的正在拔节。为过好小麦拔节关，山西、河北、山东、河南、陕西、四川、江苏和安徽等省成千上万的麦田管理大军，掀起了猛攻小麦拔节关的新高潮。各地巧施肥、巧灌水，力争促使小麦苗苗有穗，株株穗大，穗穗粒多，粒粒饱满，亩亩丰产，块块丰收。
    目前，各地小麦生长得茂密茁壮，一片油绿；比过去任何一年都好。黄河以南各省小麦苗高都在一尺以上，大部分已经封垅。
    小麦拔节期间，是小麦生长带有决定性的阶段。在这一阶段，小麦的根、茎、叶、穗全面发展，有效分蘖多少，麦秆是否粗壮，穗型大小，穗码稀密，是否子多粒重，和小麦拔节关过的好坏有极大的关系。因此，各地鼓起了更大的干劲，调整了劳动力，组织了比前一阶段更多的麦田管理队伍，猛攻、巧攻小麦拔节关。目前，河南省每天都有六百四十万麦田管理大军精心地管理麦田，施肥日进度达到二百七十九万亩，80％的麦田已追过两次肥，60％的追过三次肥。河北省四百五十万麦田管理大军，在麦田普遍追肥、浇水、中耕的基础上，再加水、加肥猛攻拔节关。安徽省麦田管理专业队伍的人数，由原来的二百三十四万多人增加到目前的三百八十二万多人。
    过好小麦拔节关最基本的措施是让小麦再次吃饱喝足。各地都为小麦拔节准备了水，准备不足的地区正在加紧突击。河南省到3月20日已为麦田浇水整修了各种小渠道二十三万七千多条，小水库七千五百多座，塘、堰、坝三万多处，打井七千多眼，挖泉一万四千多眼，全省小麦灌溉面积比浇返青水时增加了一千万亩。
    不少地区还为小麦拔节准备肥料，特别是磷钾肥料。山东省四万四千个土化肥厂的职工，正昼夜为小麦赶制土化肥，现已生产出七百多亿斤。江苏省扬中县正在突击大积、大造小麦需要的磷钾肥。农民们在“积足磷钾肥，喂饱三麦田”的口号鼓舞下，在各处沟、塘、河里已捞到螺蛳三万六千多担，全县一千二百多座土化肥厂和二万九千多个各种形式的熏土窑，还赶制出大量的土化肥。
    在攻拔节关的战斗中，各地特别注意加强大面积高额丰产田和三类苗的田间管理工作。山东、河南、山西等省都要求把三类麦苗消灭在拔节阶段，办法是边浇水、边追肥，尤其是追含氮量较多的速效肥，促使三类苗赶上一、二类麦苗。
    各地对防病虫、霜冻等工作，也都作了准备。陕西省许多地区组织了强大的防治小麦条锈病的队伍，决心把条锈病消灭在拔节前。
    今年小麦田间管理工作是越做越细致、越做越扎实。在小麦进入拔节时期，许多县和公社都普遍地组织广大的干部、老农、技术人员和社员参加的检查团，深入田头大检查、大评比，逐田逐苗分类排队，进行不同的管理。江苏泰兴县组织万人检查团深入田头，边查苗、边发动群众订出具体措施，开展竞赛，提高了麦田管理质量。
    各地在猛攻小麦拔节关的同时，还在积极地为小麦过好抽穗、扬花、灌浆、收获下几道关作好一切准备工作。
