Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 15th: Baghdad newspapers today reported a speech given by Iraqi Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Abdul Wahab Mahmoud, to a Baghdad radio station reporter on April 14th. Mahmoud said, "The Soviet Union is not only a loyal friend of Iraq but of all Arab countries. It is prepared to provide sincere assistance without any conditions to countries planning to develop their economies."

The ambassador also said that despite the United Arab Republic's slander against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is still implementing the agreements it concluded with the UAR. The Soviet Union will continue to implement these agreements.

The ambassador said that the Soviet Union is prepared to give the Republic of Iraq all possible assistance. This is the impression I got from contact with Soviet officials and citizens who pay attention to Middle Eastern affairs.

The ambassador refuted the lie about so-called Soviet infiltration of Iraq. When talking about the return to Iraq of the Barzani people who had lived in the Soviet Union, Mahmoud said that these Iraqi people, after being forced to leave Iraq during the old regime, lived in the Soviet Union. Now the Republic of Iraq has opened the way for all citizens oppressed by the old regime, including the Barzani people, to return to the country. The reason why the Barzani people have been delayed until now is that the vast majority of them are studying in schools, and they have asked the Iraqi Embassy in Moscow to assist them in returning to the country. The embassy reported this matter to the Iraqi government and received orders to assist them in returning to the country. The Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union has also provided assistance in this matter, and it is hoped that they will return to Iraq soon.

Ambassador Mahmoud said that the Soviet Union's consistent efforts to realize a policy of peace finally enabled the agreement to be reached to hold a foreign ministers' conference in Geneva this May. He said, "I believe this agreement is the result of the Soviet Union's continuous efforts from the end of the war until now."

　　伊拉克驻苏联大使发表谈话
　　苏联是阿拉伯国家的忠实朋友
　　它真诚援助打算发展经济的国家
    新华社巴格达15日电　巴格达报纸今天报道了伊拉克驻苏联大使阿卜杜勒·瓦哈卜·马哈茂德14日向巴格达电台记者发表的谈话。马哈茂德说，“苏联不仅是伊拉克的而且是所有阿拉伯国家的忠实的朋友。它准备对打算发展经济的国家提供不附带任何条件的真诚的援助。”
    这位大使又说，尽管阿联诽谤苏联，但苏联仍旧在执行它同阿联缔结的协议。苏联并且将继续执行这些协议。
    这位大使说，苏联准备给予伊拉克共和国一切可能的援助，这就是我在同那些注意中东事务的苏联人民的官员和公民接触中所得到的印象。
    这位大使驳斥了所谓苏联渗入伊拉克的谎言。在谈到曾经居住在苏联的巴尔扎尼人回伊拉克的问题时，马哈茂德说，这些伊拉克人民在旧政权时代被迫离开伊拉克之后，就住在苏联，现在伊拉克共和国已经为包括巴尔扎尼人在内的一切受旧政权压迫的公民打开了回国的道路。巴尔扎尼人所以耽搁到现在还未回国，是因为他们当中绝大部分人都在学校中学习，他们要求驻莫斯科的伊拉克大使馆对他们回国予以协助。大使馆把这件事呈报了伊拉克政府，并且得到了协助他们回国的命令。苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会也对这件事情给了帮助，人们希望他们很快会回到伊拉克。
    马哈茂德大使说，苏联为了实现和平政策所作的一贯努力，终于使今年5月在日内瓦举行外长会议的协议得以达成。他说：“我相信这个协议是苏联从战争结束直到现在所作的不断的努力的结果。”
