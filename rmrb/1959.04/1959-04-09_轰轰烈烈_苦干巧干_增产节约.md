Booming, Working Hard and Cleverly, Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
Dalian Crane Factory Uses Less Steel to Produce More Products; Du'erping Mine Collaborates Skillfully for High Yield per Unit Area
Hefei Treasures Raw Materials, Fully Utilizes Mineral Powder and Coke Breeze; Chen Zhanggen Group Tries Every Means to Save Steel

(Reported by this newspaper) "In terms of the quantity of cranes, we must do everything possible to meet the needs of the country; in terms of the supply of materials and accessories, we must try our best to reduce the burden on the country." This is the fundamental attitude adopted by the Party Committee of Dalian Crane Factory in implementing the national unified planning policy and ensuring key tasks. Under the guidance of this positive thinking, the entire factory launched a vigorous high-yield, high-quality competition centered on technological revolution. The cranes produced by the factory in the first quarter saved 30% of materials compared with the past.

In the competition, the metal structure workshop, which uses 60% to 70% of the factory's steel, had more than 1,200 workers participate in the Red and Expert Design Institute to save steel by modifying designs and designing new types of cranes. They have designed twenty-one types of lightweight, durable, and beautiful bridge cranes. Currently, the design department has completed the modification and design of five types of bridge cranes from 15 tons to 75 tons and put them into production. The modification and design of heavy-duty cranes from 140 tons to 200 tons has also been completed. In order to overcome the difficulty in supplying many accessories for cranes, the factory found a way out through large-scale substitution. For example, each crane requires dozens or even hundreds of sets of ball bearings. In order to reduce the pressure on the supply of ball bearings, they have studied measures to use iron sleeves instead of ball bearings on some minor components. In February, there was a shortage of one-half of the shaped steel needed for production. The workers used steel plates to press shaped steel, meeting the urgent needs of production and ensuring the completion of the plan.

In the high-yield, high-quality competition, each workshop, with technological revolution as the center, launched high-efficiency competitions in different forms such as "Thousand Machine Hours" and "One Top Two," and production efficiency increased steadily. Since the launch of the Thousand Machine Hours movement in the machinery workshop, 40% to 50% of the machine tools have reached the Thousand Machine Hours target in just five or six days. Since the metal structure workshop launched the daily competition of "One Top Two" and "Start Work with Progress, Hand Over Tasks After Work," production has been red-hot every day, and the daily output of mid-beams has increased from five to fifteen. Due to the launch of this series of competitions, the product quality of each workshop has also been greatly improved. The forging workshop has eliminated rework. The product quality of the manual section of the machinery workshop has been reduced from an average of 1.3 hours per day in the past to 0.7 hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 8th. All steel plants in Hefei City, Anhui Province, are using mineral powder, coke breeze, and limestone powder to vigorously produce sintered ore for ironmaking. At present, 116 sintering furnaces have been built in the city, with a daily output of more than 200 tons. The quality of sintered ore is very high, with an iron content of generally over 50%.

Since the vigorous development of steel last year, Hefei City has accumulated more than 25,000 tons of mineral powder. Turning these mineral powders into sintered ore and using sintered ore to make iron can increase the output and quality of pig iron and reduce the coke ratio and cost. According to the results of several steel plants in Hefei City, the iron output of sintered ore is generally 10% higher than that of iron ore, and the highest can be increased by 20%. After the ore is sintered, part of the sulfur and impurities are removed, and the sulfur content of the iron smelted from it is also reduced by 0.07. Since sintered ore is easy to smelt after entering the furnace, the coke used for smelting one ton of iron is also reduced to 1 ton to 1.2 tons. For example, if 20 kilograms of sintered ore are added to each batch of materials, the furnace temperature will not be affected without increasing the coke. At the same time, the cost is also very low. The cost of ironmaking with sintered ore is about 60% lower than that of iron ore.

The Hefei Municipal Party Committee attaches great importance to the work of using mineral powder and coke breeze to produce sintered ore. At the end of last year, a sintering experiment group was established, and the earth method sintering experiment was first carried out in the experimental field of the Municipal Party Committee Steel Plant, and then vigorously promoted throughout the city through on-site meetings and other methods. At present, 28 of the city's 32 steel plants have used sintered ore for ironmaking.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th. The Du'erping Coal Mine of the Xishan Mining Bureau has achieved high yield per unit area due to the competition focusing on technological innovation and strengthened cooperation. Since March, many coal mining faces of this mine have reached a level of producing more than 10,000 tons of raw coal per month; among them, the average output of four new coal mining faces in March reached more than 23,400 tons, exceeding the target required by the Ministry of Coal Industry by nearly one time.

The planned raw coal output of this mine this year is 1.6 million tons, an increase of 50.4% compared with the actual output last year. In mid-March, the mine's Party committee analyzed the production situation and proposed that the mine's daily output should be increased from more than 4,000 tons in the past to 5,700 tons, and analyzed the potential in production and methods to tap the potential to the masses. The entire mine immediately launched a competition focusing on technological innovation and strengthened cooperation. The daily output of raw coal quickly jumped to more than 6,100 tons. In the competition, cooperation between shifts was further strengthened, so that coal trucks did not stop and coal chutes did not stop during shift handover, which greatly increased the output per unit area and made the monthly output of many working faces reach more than 10,000 tons.

(Reported by this newspaper) Chen Zhanggen and other four youth marking groups in the hull workshop of Hudong Shipyard saved 208.5 tons of steel in March. The Chen Zhanggen group, which was awarded by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League in 1956 and has always attached importance to saving raw materials, saved 14 tons in January, 7 tons in February, and jumped to 59.5 tons in March.

Marking seems to be a very rigid job. The process requirements are stipulated by the technical department, and even the templates are made by the laying-off group. The task of the marking workers is to "draw gourds according to the pattern" on the whole steel plate, and then let the gas cutting workers cut the "gourds" from the steel. A few years ago, Chen Zhanggen himself and his team turned "drawing gourds according to the pattern" into "creating patterns to draw gourds" and created a set of steel-saving marking methods. One of them is called the nesting method, which is to use the method of assembling a tangram to piece together different parts of different sizes on a steel plate. In this way, a batch of parts can save several tons of steel. Another time, a batch of curved parts that were difficult to arrange came. A steel plate could only mark one part. They cut the parts apart, marked, cut, and then welded them together. Two steel plates could actually make five. This method is called the splicing method. As for not wasting small materials, piecing them together as good materials, substituting zero for the whole, and collecting discarded materials from all over the factory, there are of course more tips. There is also this situation: according to the required joints on the process drawings, some steel plates will be wasted. Can it be changed? Will this affect the quality? This requires instructions from the technical department, and even the consent of the owner unit to modify it. Once, in order to save steel and ensure quality, there was no time to contact them on the same day. They would rather stop their work to support the work of other groups and catch up with the production tasks they had left behind yesterday after solving the problem tomorrow. Chen Zhanggen and his team are working with a spirit of being responsible for every inch of steel. It is precisely because of this that they saved 317 tons of steel last year, and this year, they have raised the target to 500 tons.

The advanced thinking and advanced experience of the Chen Zhanggen group have already taken root and blossomed in the other three youth marking groups. The achievement of Bao Xingen's group in saving steel in March exceeded that of Chen Zhanggen's group, and Zhang Wenshou's group also followed closely behind.

    轰轰烈烈　苦干巧干　增产节约
    大连起重机厂少用钢材多出产品　杜儿坪矿协作巧干单位面积丰产
    合肥珍惜原料充分利用矿粉焦末　陈章根等小组千方百计节约钢材
    本报讯　“在起重机的数量上，要千方百计地满足国家的需要；在材料和配件的供应上，要尽量减轻国家的负担。”——这是中共大连起重机器厂党委在贯彻全国一盘棋方针，确保重点所采取的根本态度。在这个积极的思想指导下，全厂展开了一个热火朝天的、以技术革命为中心的高产优质大竞赛，全厂第一季度生产的起重机比过去节约材料30％。
    在竞赛运动中，使用钢材占全厂百分之六七十的金构车间，一千二百多名工人参加到红专设计院，通过修改设计、设计新型起重机的办法来节约钢材。他们已经设计出二十一种体轻、耐用、美观的桥式起重机。目前设计科已经完成了十五吨到七十五吨等五种桥式起重机修改设计的工作，并投入生产。一百四十吨到二百吨重型起重机修改设计的工作也已完成。为了克服起重机上许多配件供应的困难，这个工厂从大省大代方面找出路。比如每台起重机上需要几十套、甚至成百套滚珠，为了减轻滚珠供应上的压力，他们已研究出在一些次要的部件上利用铁套代替滚珠的措施。2月份生产中缺少型钢二分之一，工人利用钢板压制成型钢，满足了生产急需，保证了计划的完成。
    在高产优质竞赛中，各个车间以技术革命为中心，分别展开了“千台时”、“一顶两”等不同形式的高效率竞赛，生产效率节节上升。机械车间开展千台时运动以来，仅五、六天的时间就有40％—50％的机床达到千台时的指标。金属结构车间展开一顶两和上班接进度、下班交任务的日竞赛以来，生产日日红，中梁由日产五台提高到十五台。由于开展这一系列的竞赛运动，各车间产品质量也大大提高。锻造车间已消灭了返手活。机械车间接手工段的产品质量由过去每天平均一点三小时，降低到零点七小时。
    本报合肥8日电　安徽省合肥市各钢铁厂利用矿粉、焦末和石灰石粉，大搞烧结矿炼铁。目前，全市已建成了一百一十六个烧结炉，日产量达到了二百多吨。烧结矿的质量很高，含铁量一般都在50％以上。
    去年大办钢铁以来，合肥市积存矿粉共达两万五千多吨，把这些矿粉变成烧结矿，用烧结矿炼铁，可以提高生铁的产量、质量，降低焦比和成本。据合肥市几个钢铁厂使用的结果表明：烧结矿比矿石炼铁的出铁量，一般能提高10％，最高的能提高20％。矿石烧结后脱去了一部分硫和杂质，铁的含硫量也比用矿石炼出的铁降低零点零七。由于烧结矿入炉后容易冶炼，每炼一吨铁所用的焦炭，也降低到一吨至一点二吨，如在每批料中搭配二十公斤烧结矿，不增加焦炭并不影响炉温。同时成本也很低，用烧结矿炼铁要比铁矿石炼铁成本降低60％左右。
    中共合肥市委对利用矿粉、焦末生产烧结矿的工作极为重视。从去年底即成立了烧结试验小组，首先在市委钢铁厂试验田进行土法烧结试验，然后通过现场会议等方式在全市大力推广。目前，全市三十二个钢铁厂，已有二十八个厂使用了烧结矿炼铁。
    新华社太原8日电　西山矿务局杜儿坪煤矿由于开展了以技术革新和加强协作为主要内容的竞赛运动，获得单位面积丰产。3月份以来这个矿许多采煤工作面都已达到月产原煤万吨以上的水平；其中，四个新法采煤工作面3月份的平均产量达到二万三千四百多吨，超过煤炭工业部要求的指标近一倍。
    这个矿今年原煤产量计划是一百六十万吨，比去年实际产量提高50.4％。3月中旬，矿党委分析了生产情况，提出全矿日产量要由过去的四千多吨提高到五千七百吨，并且向群众分析了生产中的潜力和挖掘潜力的方法，全矿立即展开了以技术革新和加强协作为主要内容的竞赛运动，原煤日产量很快就跃进到六千一百多吨。竞赛中，班与班之间进一步加强了协作，交接班时，作到运煤车不停、煤溜子不停，从而大大提高了单位面积产量，使许多工作面的月产量达万吨以上。
    本报讯　沪东造船厂船体车间的陈章根等四个青年落料小组，在3月份节约了钢材二百零八吨半。1956年曾得到团中央奖励，一贯重视节约原材料的陈章根小组，今年1月份节约了十四吨，2月份节约了七吨，3月份一跳而为五十九吨半。
    落料这工作，看起来好像很呆板，工艺要求是技术部门规定的，甚至板样也由放样小组做好了，落料工人的任务，就是在整块的钢板上“依样画葫芦”，然后再让气割工人把“葫芦”从钢材上切下来。几年以前，陈章根本人以及他的小组，把“依样画葫芦”变成了“创样画葫芦”，创造了一套节省钢材的落料方法。这里面有一种叫套料法，是运用拼七巧板一样的办法，把大大小小不同的零件拼凑在一块钢板上的，这样，一批零件，就可节省几吨钢。还有一次，来了一批弯弯曲曲形状难于安排的零件，一块钢板只能落一只零件，他们把零件切开来，落料、切割后再用电焊拼接起来，两块钢板竟然可以做五只，这种方法叫做拼接法。至于小料不浪费，拼拼凑凑当好料，以零代整，到全厂各处搜集丢弃的材料，这种窍门当然更多了。还有这种情况，根据工艺图纸上要求的接缝，钢板要浪费一些，是不是能改一改呢？这会不会影响质量呢？这就得请示技术部门，甚至要得到业主单位的同意才能修改。有一次，为了做到既节约钢材，又保证质量，当天已经来不及联系，他们宁愿停下活去支援别组的工作，等明天解决了问题再加油赶上昨天脱下的生产任务。陈章根和他的小组，正是怀着对每一寸钢负责的精神在工作的。正是这样，去年一年，他们节约了三百十七吨钢材，今年，他们又把指标提高到了五百吨。
    陈章根小组的先进思想和先进经验已经在其他三个青年落料小组开花结果。包新根小组3月份节约钢材的成绩超过了陈章根小组，张文寿小组也紧跟在后面。
