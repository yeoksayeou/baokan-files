Chairman and fellow members:

I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Through this conference, I have gained great inspiration and education, which will guide my continued political study and ideological remolding. I feel very happy and excited. Now, I would like to talk about the prevention and treatment of leprosy in our country.

The prevention and treatment of leprosy in our country has only occurred after the founding of the People's Government, under the leadership, instructions, and support of the Party and the Ministry of Health. In a short period, from 1951 to now, only eight years, all leprosy patients in the country have basically received treatment and isolation. This is unprecedented in history! On the contrary, in the old society, leprosy patients were not only not prevented and treated, but they were also discriminated against, hated, and even killed! During the warlord era, Chen Jitang in Guangdong and Zhang Zongchang in Shandong committed such inhumane atrocities by shooting leprosy patients! During the Kuomintang era, Song Ziwen also committed similar acts in Guangdong!

Under the leadership and guidance of the Ministry of Health, professional cadres have been trained for leprosy prevention and treatment. Domestic chemical drugs are used to treat leprosy, and institutions have been established to accommodate leprosy patients. Now, the vast majority of leprosy patients receive the warmth of the Party and governments at all levels, and their minds are extremely happy!

(1) Cadre Training: From 1951 to 1957, under the guidance of the Ministry of Health, five advanced training courses have been held, training 114 professional doctors. They held intermediate training courses in various regions, training more than 2,400 professional medical assistants. In 1958, Argentine expert Professor Skhumann held a similar advanced class in Guangdong, graduating 40 students. These more than 2,500 professional medical cadres have all devoted themselves to the leprosy prevention and treatment front, enthusiastically, faithfully, and bravely fighting leprosy. This is due to the leadership and support of the Party that such achievements have been made; it is also a measure that only a socialist country can take. On the contrary, leprosy is quite serious in the four southeastern provinces of the US imperialists, Florida, Virginia, Georgia, and Louisiana. The US imperialist government never pays attention to leprosy prevention and treatment. I once asked Mr. Kiras, the Secretary-General of the International Leprosy Association in New York, how much money the US government spends on leprosy prevention and treatment. He replied: "Donations from charitable organizations, the government does not manage the funds!" Therefore, their leprosy cannot be eradicated!

(2) Establishment of Institutions: Before liberation, there were nine small leprosy hospitals in our country, all run by churches and were tools used by imperialism to carry out cultural aggression. After a female missionary from the Dongguan Leprosy Hospital in Guangdong returned to her country, pistols, bullets, and silver dollars were found in her residence. Undoubtedly, she was doing espionage work. From liberation to 1957, the Central Ministry of Health newly built and expanded a total of 32 large and small leprosy hospitals. Since the people's communes were established in rural areas throughout the country in 1958, areas with leprosy epidemics have been the responsibility of the commune to allocate land, houses, and labor tools to establish small leprosy villages, where patients can labor and produce, and become self-sufficient. Medical personnel provide regular mobile medical care, issue medicines, and carry out treatment. This measure has been implemented in 65 counties in Shandong, establishing more than 300 leprosy villages. It is planned that by the end of 1959, approximately 50,000 leprosy patients can enter the villages and receive isolated treatment. The patients who have already entered the villages are very happy in their minds, receiving the warmth given by the Party and the government! Individual patients believe that they would not be lonely if they could live in the village with their family members! In areas with fewer leprosy patients, communes and communes can jointly run a village, or counties and counties can run a village together, which is also possible.

(3) Supply of Medicines for Treating Leprosy: The chemical drugs currently used, such as Dapsone, Solapsone, and Thiourea, are all domestically produced (produced by Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory). The efficacy of the application is the same as that of imported goods. But the drug prices are much cheaper. Imported Thiourea costs one dime per tablet, while the price of 100 tablets of domestic products is only five dimes. According to Comrade Fang Renlin, a technician at Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory, "If this drug is produced in large quantities, the price can be further reduced."

The treatment summary of the 7th International Leprosy Conference held in Tokyo, Japan in December 1958, shows that the chemical products internationally used to treat leprosy are the same as what we use now. But the medicines we use are all domestic products, and we no longer need to import them.

(4) Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment for Leprosy: It is certain that the application of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions to treat leprosy is effective. Shanghai Leprosy Hospital has reported that oral administration of "Saofeng Pills" to leprosy patients has good results. Since 1958, Jinan Leprosy Clinic has treated more than 40 leprosy patients with "Kushen Pills." Preliminary conclusions show that the treatment is faster for tuberculoid leprosy patients and slower for lepromatous leprosy patients. However, no reactions have occurred with the application of this drug. After taking the medicine, patients feel that their appetite has increased and their physical strength has improved.

(5) Preventing Leprosy: Intradermal injection of lepromin, combined with subcutaneous injection or oral administration of BCG vaccine, is valuable for preventing leprosy. The lepromin test for healthy children is mostly a negative reaction. If BCG vaccine is taken orally or injected subcutaneously, the lepromin reaction can be changed from negative to positive. Whether children or adults, if the lepromin test is positive, it is not easy to be infected with Mycobacterium leprae and develop leprosy. Even if it occurs, it is tuberculoid leprosy, which is relatively easy to treat. In the autumn of 1958, when leprosy was surveyed in Jiaoxian, Shandong, preventive injections were given to more than 2,000 family members of patients. A follow-up survey will be conducted in the autumn of 1959 to summarize the incidence rate. This kind of work needs to be continuously observed for two or three years before a more detailed report can be made.

I am not a professional doctor in the prevention and treatment of leprosy. What I have talked about above is certainly not comprehensive. If there are any errors, please correct them and I would welcome it sincerely.

    麻疯病的治疗和预防
    在旧社会，麻疯病患者受到反动统治者的歧视、甚至仇视杀害；在新社会，他们受到党和政府的关怀和治疗尤家骏委员的发言主席团、各位委员：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周总理的报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理及彭真副委员长的报告。经过这次大会，我得到极大的启发与教育，对我个人继续学习政治与思想改造，有所遵循，我感到十分愉快而兴奋。现在我愿意谈谈我国麻疯病的防治情况。
    我国麻疯病的防治工作只有在人民政府成立后，在党、卫生部领导指示与支持下，经过短短的时间，自一九五一年到现在，不过八年，全国的麻疯患者基本上都得到了治疗与隔离，这是有史以来所未有的！相反的，在旧时代里，对于麻疯患者不但不防治，而且歧视他们、仇视他们、甚至杀害他们！在军阀时代，广东陈济棠，山东张宗昌都做过这样失去人性枪杀麻疯患者的惨事！国民党时代，宋子文在广东亦做过同样的行为！
    在卫生部领导与指示下，为麻疯病防治工作培养了专业干部，应用国产化学药品治疗麻疯病，建立机构收容麻疯病患者。现在绝大多数麻疯病患者得到党、各级政府的温暖，思想极为愉快！
    （一）干部培养：自一九五一年到一九五七年，在卫生部指示下，已举办高级进修班五次，培养专业医师一百一十四名，他们在各地区举办中级进修班，培养了二千四百多名专业医士。一九五八年由阿根廷专家司胡曼教授，在广东举办同样高级班一次，结业学员四十名。这二千五百多名专业医务干部，都投入麻疯防治战线上，热心的、忠实的、勇敢的与麻疯病作斗争。这是由于党的领导与支持，才有这样的成就；也是社会主义国家，才有这样的措施。相反的，美帝国主义的东南部四省，弗劳勒达、维尔珍尼亚、乔治亚、路爱即亚纳，麻疯病流行相当严重，美帝政府对麻疯病防治从不注意。我曾问驻纽约国际麻疯会总干事，祁拉士先生，美国政府出多少款做麻疯防治工作，他回答说：“由慈善团体捐款，政府不管经费！”因此，他们的麻疯病不可能杜绝的！
    （二）机构建立：解放前我国有小型麻疯院九处，都是教会办的，是帝国主义借以进行文化侵略的工具。广东东莞麻疯院，女传教士回国后，在她的住宅内，发现手枪与子弹及银圆。无疑的是做特务工作。自解放后到一九五七年，中央卫生部新建扩建大、小麻疯院共有三十二处。自一九五八年全国农村人民公社化以后，有麻疯病流行的地区，由社负责分给土地、房子、劳动工具，成立小型麻疯村，患者可以劳动生产，自给自足。医务人员按时巡回医疗，发给药品，进行治疗。这种措施在山东已有六十五个县建立麻疯村，共三百多处。计划在一九五九年年底以前，约五万多名麻疯病患者都可以进村，得到隔离治疗。现在已经入村的病员们，得到党与政府给予的温暖，思想上甚为愉快！个别的病员，认为若能得到与家中的亲人同住村内，才不寂寞！有的地区麻疯病员少，社与社联合举办一个村，或县与县举办一个村，也是可以的。
    （三）治疗麻疯病的药品供应：现在应用的化学药品如氨苯砜、苯丙砜、氨硫脲等都有国产品（新华药厂出品），应用的疗效与进口货相同。但药价便宜的很多，进口的氨硫脲每片一角钱，国产品一百片的药价只五角多钱。据新华药厂技正方人麟同志说：“若是大量生产此种药，价格还能降低。”
    一九五八年十二月在日本东京举行第七次国际麻疯会议的治疗总结，国际应用的化学品治疗麻疯病与现在我们用的相同。但我们用的药都是国产品，再不用进口药了。
    （四）中药治疗麻疯病：应用中药处方治疗麻疯病，肯定是有效的，上海麻疯院给麻疯病患者口服扫风丸已有报告，效果良好。自一九五八年济南麻疯门诊用苦参丸已治疗麻疯患者四十多名，初步总结，对于结核样型麻疯患者疗效快，对于瘤型麻疯患者效果慢一些。但应用此药，未曾发生反应，服药后，都感觉食欲增强，体力好转。
    （五）预防麻疯病：皮内注射麻疯菌素，结合皮下注射或口服卡介苗，预防麻疯病是有价值的。健康儿童麻疯菌素试验，大多数是阴性反应，若口服或皮下注射卡介苗，可以使麻疯菌素反应，由阴性转变为阳性。无论儿童或成人，若麻疯菌素呈阳性反应，不容易感染麻疯菌发生麻疯病，即发生也是结核样型麻疯病，比较容易治疗。一九五八年秋季，在山东胶县普查麻疯病时，为患者的家属，做预防注射者共二千多人，一九五九年秋季再做复查工作，总结发病率。此种工作，需要继续观察两三年后才能作出比较详细的报告。
    我不是防治麻疯病的专业医生，以上所谈的肯定不全面，有错误的地方，敬请指正，衷心欢迎。
