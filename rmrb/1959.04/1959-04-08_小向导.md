    Little Guide
    Li Huixin
    It was hard enough to climb to the top of the mountain, and I was just about to start my surveying work when I suddenly heard the grass rustling behind me. I turned around and saw many black dots slowly moving towards the top of the mountain in the grassy hillside, as if trying to surround me. When they got closer, I realized they were children. They stared at me with wide eyes, full of curiosity. This didn't particularly catch my attention because when I was their age, I was also curious about the things adults did, things I considered strange. I continued with my positioning work...
    "Comrade, where are you from?" a voice said from behind.
    "I'm a surveyor from Beijing," I replied without even turning my head.
    "Please come to our commune!"
    "Thank you, but I won't. Maybe another time when I'm free."
    "No, come with us!" This was practically an order.
    I turned around in surprise. Standing in front of me was a boy of fifteen or sixteen. Many other younger children were gradually gathering behind him, some even clenching their fists. I began to sense that something was wrong.
    "Brother Guan Lin is here!" I don't know which child shouted in a high-pitched voice. I quickly looked down the mountain and saw two militiamen with guns walking towards me...
    On the way, I tried my best to explain to them, but it was no use. The militiamen kept saying to me, "Don't worry, everything will be clear when we get to the commune!" So, I had no choice but to remain silent, but I was anxious in my heart: "What will happen if I can't complete today's surveying task?"
    I was like an ant on a hot pan, sitting in the commune committee's office. The militia comrades even poured me a bowl of water, but I couldn't drink it. I finally waited for the commune leader to arrive.
    The commune leader was an old man with a goatee. After hearing about my situation, he reached out his hand to me and said, "Sorry, comrade, this is all a misunderstanding."
    "It's nothing!" To be honest, I was a little annoyed.
    "You see, it's delayed your work." The commune leader seemed to have read my mind. "However, our defense work in this coastal frontline area must be strict. A few days ago, these children did catch a bad guy. Today, they caught the wrong person." As he spoke, the commune leader laughed heartily. "Look, these are the reports the children wrote about you."
    I took a report written on grass paper from the commune leader's hand and struggled to recognize the pencil-written words:
    "Comrade Commune Leader:
    Today, we discovered a person wearing tattered clothes, who seemed to be carrying a box cannon on his waist. He came out of the grass and climbed directly up the south slope towards the top of the mountain. We are now closely following behind him. Please send militiamen immediately!"
    After reading the report, I looked down at my own clothes, which were torn in many places by branches. No wonder they suspected me. The "box cannon" mentioned in the note was probably the compass on my waist.
    The commune leader accompanied me to the door and repeatedly apologized to me. I felt a little sorry instead. As I walked out of the village entrance, I saw the children playing nearby again. I nodded to them in a friendly manner, but the oldest boy turned his face away, probably feeling embarrassed for catching the wrong person.
    For the sake of the commune's steelmaking task, the team decided to temporarily assign us to each commune to specifically solve the problem of raw materials for steelmaking. Coincidentally, I was assigned to this commune that I had visited before, and my guide was the boy who had "invited" me to the commune, his name was Lin Xiaogang.
    When we stood together, the commune leader patted me and Xiaogang's shoulders affectionately and said with a smile, "Old acquaintances! This time, half of our commune's steelmaking task is placed on you. As long as you find iron ore, our small native furnace can continue to produce steel!"
    The next morning, we went up the mountain early. Xiaogang was a good climber. Although the mountain was sometimes very steep, he could climb up nimbly like a monkey. Thanks to the climbing practice we had before the exploration team set off, and the actual work experience of the past half month, otherwise I would have really fallen behind. Even so, Xiaogang sometimes had to stop in front to wait for me.
    I was so thirsty that I couldn't stand it anymore when I suddenly noticed a crystal-clear stream in front of me. I was about to use a bowl to scoop it up when Xiaogang shouted from the front:
    "Don't drink it, this water can kill people!" When I looked carefully into the bottom of the river, I realized that it was water containing a lot of sulfur. I looked at Xiaogang gratefully.
    We sat down to rest on the mountainside. I took out various iron ore samples from my backpack and showed them to Xiaogang. He was very smart and remembered them all clearly in a short while. When he saw the hematite in my backpack, his eyes immediately widened: "There are many such red stones on the mountain over there!" "Really, you're not mistaken?" We immediately stood up and climbed towards that mountaintop.
    We climbed about four or five hundred meters, but we still hadn't seen any hematite. I was gradually losing confidence. But Xiaogang kept moving forward desperately. The grass in front was getting deeper and deeper, and in some places, only our heads could be seen. Xiaogang desperately cut the grass with the small sickle in his hand, and I used both hands to push it aside. We climbed up the mountain for more than eight hundred meters, cutting and walking all the way.
    I used a geological hammer to strike the ore with force, and Xiaogang knelt nervously beside me...
    "Ah! I found it, such good hematite!" I happily showed the ore to Xiaogang.
    My little guide and I only stayed together for two days. On the third night, the team transferred us away because there were more urgent tasks elsewhere. I didn't even have time to say goodbye. I left a copy of all the mineral specimens for Xiaogang and asked the commune leader to pass them on to him.
    When our Fujian geological exploration team was about to gather in Fuzhou, the team passed through here. I asked the captain to let me see my little guide. The captain agreed to my request.
    I couldn't believe my eyes, it had simply turned into a small industrial base. The south slope—where I was "captured"—was brightly lit and bustling with activity, while the village was very quiet. I was looking around when something hard suddenly poked my back. "Don't move!" How was this voice so familiar? Before I could think, I heard a burst of "haha" laughter. Turning around, I saw my little guide and his group of children.
    "Let's go! Let's go to our house!" Xiaogang grabbed my arm forcefully. "I'll take you to see our steel mill."
    But in order to catch up with our team, I couldn't go. After walking a distance, Xiaogang suddenly chased after me and stuffed two round things into my arms, then ran away again. I looked and saw that they were two big tangerines. I kept these two big tangerines with me all the time, and I couldn't bear to eat them. (Attached image) [Hua Ke Xiong illustration]

    小向导
    李惠薪
    好容易才爬到山顶上，我刚刚要开始勘测工作，突然听见身后边的草在簌簌作响，回头一看，发现在漫山坡的草丛里有好些黑点在慢慢地向山顶移近，仿佛要包围我一样。待走近一看，才看出是些孩子。他们瞪圆眼睛，好奇地看着我。这并没有引起我的注意。因为当我像他们这样大的时候，也是这样好奇地看着大人们做那些自己认为是稀奇古怪的事。我继续进行定点的工作……。
    “同志，你从哪儿来？”身后有个声音说。
  “我是北京来的勘探队员”。我连头也没回。
    “请你到我们社里去一趟吧！”
    “谢谢你，不去了，以后有空再去吧。”
    “不，跟我们走吧！”这简直是在命令了。
    我惊奇地回过了头。站在我面前的是个十五、六岁的男孩。其余许多年纪较小的孩子也在他身后渐渐靠拢来，有的甚至握起了拳头。我开始感到有些不对头了。
      “管林大哥来了！”不知道那个孩子尖声喊了一句。我急忙向山下望去，两个背着枪的民兵向我走来……。
    在路上，我竭力向他们解释，但这并没有用。民兵总是对我说：“你不用着急，到社里一切就会搞明白的！”这样我只好不做声了，可是心里却着急起来：“今天的勘测任务完不成可怎么办？”
    我像热锅上的蚂蚁似的，坐在社委会的办公室里，民兵同志还给我倒了碗水，我哪里喝得下去。好容易盼着社长来了。
    社长是个留着山羊胡子的老大爷，听说了我的情况，他就向我伸出手来：“对不起同志，这都是误会。”
      “没什么！”说心里话，我倒真有点不高兴。
      “你看耽搁了你的工作。”社长仿佛看出我的心思似的，“不过，我们这海防前线地区的保卫工作就是要严一些。前些天，这些孩子们确实抓着一个坏人呢。今天呢，可把你抓错了。”说着社长哈哈地笑起来，“你看看这是孩子们给我打来的关于你的报告。”
    我从社长手里接过了一张用草纸写成的报告，费了好大的劲儿才认出那上面用铅笔写成的字：
      “社长同志：
    今天我们发现一个身穿破衣的人，腰间好像带着盒子枪，由草丛里出来，顺着南山坡，直向山顶爬去。现在我们正紧紧地跟在他的后边，请火速派民兵来！”
    看过报告，再低头看看我这身衣裳，到处都是被树枝刮破的破口，也难怪人家怀疑我。便条中指的盒子枪，大概就是我腰中的罗盘吧。
    社长一直把我送到门口，再三向我道歉。我反倒觉得有些过意不去了。走出村口的时候，我看见那群孩子又在附近玩，我友好地向他们点点头，可是那最大的孩子却掉转了脸，大概他觉得抓错了人难为情了。
    为了公社炼钢任务的需要，队部决定把我们暂时分配到每个社去，具体解决社里炼钢的原料问题。说来也巧，我就被分配我来过的这个社来了，而且我的向导就是那个“邀请”我到社里去的男孩子，他叫林小刚。
    当我们站在一起的时候，社长亲切地拍着我和小刚的肩膀，笑着说：“老相识了。这回咱们社里的炼钢任务可有一半放在你们身上了，只要找着了铁矿石，咱们小土炉就可以继续出钢水喽！”
    第二天清早我们就上山了。小刚是个很好的爬山运动员，虽然有时山很陡，可是他却能轻巧的像猴子似的爬上去。多亏勘探队临出发前练习过爬山，又经过半个月来实际工作的锻炼，要不然我可真得掉队呢。即使这样，有时小刚还要在前面停下来等一等我。
    我实在渴的不行了，忽然发现前面有条清澈见底的小溪。我正要用碗去舀，小刚在前面喊了起来：
  “别喝，这水能毒死人！”当我仔细向河底里望去的时候，才发现这是一条含硫很多的水，我感激地望了望小刚。
    在半山腰上，我们坐下来休息了。我把背包里的各种铁矿石拿给小刚看。他很聪明，一会儿就都记得清楚了。当他看见我背包里的赤铁矿时，眼睛立时瞪圆了：“那边山上有好些这样的红石头！”“真的，你没有看错？”我们立刻站起来，向那边山顶爬去。
    爬了大概有四、五百公尺了，可是还没见着赤铁矿。我渐渐有点失去信心了。可是小刚却拼命地往前走。前面草越来越深了，有的地方只能露出头来。小刚用他手里的小镰刀，拼命地割着，我就用两手去拨。我们就这样一路割、一路走地爬上了八百多公尺的高山。
    我用地质锤，使劲地敲打着矿石，小刚紧张地跪在我的旁边……
  “啊！找着了，多好的赤铁矿！”我高兴地把矿石拿给小刚看。
    我和我的小向导在一起只待了两天，第三天夜里队部就把我们调走了，因为别的地方还有更紧急的任务。我连告别都没来得及。我把各种矿石标本都给小刚留了一份，托社长转交给小刚。
    我们地质勘探队福建分队要往福州集中的时候，队伍路过这里。我请求队长让我去看一看小向导。队长答应了我的要求。
    我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛，这里简直变成一个小工业基地了。南山坡上——也就是我被“捕”的地方，灯光辉煌，人声沸腾，村里可很清静。我正东张西望，突然后背上顶了一个硬硬的东西。“别动”！这声音怎么这样熟？还没等我想过来，只听见一阵“哈哈”的笑声，回头一看，正是我的小向导和他那伙小朋友们。
    “走吧！上我们家去！”小刚使劲抓着我的胳膊。“我带你看看我们的炼钢厂去”。
    但是为了追赶我们的队伍，我不能去了。走了一段路，突然小刚追来往我怀里塞了两个圆圆的东西又跑走了。我一看原来是两个大蜜橘。这两个大蜜橘，我一直把它们带在身边，总也舍不得吃。（附图片）〔华克雄插图〕
