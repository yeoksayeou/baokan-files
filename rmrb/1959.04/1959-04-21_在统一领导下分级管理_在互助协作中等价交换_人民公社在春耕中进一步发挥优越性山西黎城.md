    Taiyuan, April 20th (People's Daily report) - In the current spring plowing production, Yuanzhuang People's Commune in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, has solved a series of problems that management areas could not solve under unified leadership; at the same time, it has correctly implemented graded management, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses.
    Yuanzhuang People's Commune is divided into eight management areas. When spring plowing production was in full swing, each management area generally lacked agricultural tools. The entire commune lacked more than 500 pairs of manure baskets alone. Some management areas did not have the strength to solve these difficulties themselves; although some management areas had the conditions to weave manure baskets and repair agricultural tools, they could not do so due to insufficient labor. For this reason, the commune uniformly transferred fourteen laborers and seventeen head of livestock from various management areas and carried out labor exchange and mutual assistance with management areas that had the conditions to weave manure baskets. In this way, 420 pairs of manure baskets were woven within a few days, providing each team with tools for transporting fertilizer. The commune's unified agricultural tool repair and manufacturing plant concentrated its efforts on repairing and manufacturing more than 1,000 pieces of various agricultural tools, basically solving the problem of insufficient agricultural tools in the entire commune.
    During sowing, the commune also uniformly regulated improved varieties within the entire commune. For example, the "Jiguan millet" planted in the Yuanzhuang management area had not been replaced for three years, and the average yield per mu was only 270 jin. The "Mother Hen Beak" and "Qinggu" planted in the Houjiashan and Zhujiajun management areas yielded an average of 392 jin per mu, so the commune transferred 1,700 jin of high-quality millet seeds to Yuanzhuang in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange. Most of the corn planted in Luotuo Gully was local Yujiao, and the yield was very low. The commune transferred 700 jin of Golden Queen seeds from Yuanzhuang to ensure that everyone sowed improved varieties in a timely manner.
    There is a canal in the Yuanquan management area that can irrigate the land of six villages. In the past, the method of irrigating the land was: whoever irrigates the land, watches the canal (for fear of water leakage). For an eight-mile-long canal, three people irrigating the land required seven people to watch the canal. Moreover, quarrels and fights often occurred between villages due to competition for irrigation, and the waste of water was also great. This year, the entire commune uniformly organized a six-person water conservancy team to be responsible for irrigation, which saves both labor and water. Recently, 2,000 mu of wheat in the entire commune were irrigated with jointing water in eighteen days; in the past, it took twenty-five days to complete the irrigation. Facts have proved that under the unified leadership of the commune, labor, materials, and financial resources can be used most rationally.
    The Yuanzhuang Commune also adjusted the varieties of food grains for its members. In the past, the situation here was that some villages had millet but no wheat, while other villages had wheat but no millet. For example, the Dongluotuo Management Area had a lot of millet and little wheat, with an average of only 20 jin of wheat per person; while the Yuanzhuang Management Area had a lot of wheat and little millet, and only harvested 7,000 jin of millet last year, suffering from not being able to eat millet. Therefore, the commune adjusted the prices according to the variety.
    The Yuanzhuang People's Commune also played a significant role in supervising the management areas to complete the state planting plan during spring plowing and sowing.
    While the Yuanzhuang Commune solved problems that the management areas were unable to solve under unified leadership, it also paid full attention to implementing graded management and giving play to the role of each management area. All eight management areas of the commune, based on the unified plan of the commune, also formulated specific indicators for their own management area in accordance with local conditions. For example, Yuanzhuang, with its good land and water conservancy conditions in the 50-mu management area, stipulated that this year's grain yield per mu should be 1,000 jin to 1,500 jin. The Dongluotuo and other management areas had poorer conditions and aimed to achieve a grain yield of 600 jin per mu this year. At the same time, each management area formulated specific measures, how to use labor, the quota for each agricultural task, the time to complete each agricultural task, and specific requirements based on their own indicators. In this way, the commune's plan was further specified, and the commune's plan truly became the plan of the management area. Therefore, the production enthusiasm of each management area was unprecedentedly high, and the attendance rate of the members reached more than 95%. Especially since the recent development of the "Learn from Tianzhu, Catch up with Tianzhu" movement, members often exceed their quotas. The Yuanquan Management Area stipulated that the quota for hoeing dry land wheat was one and a half mu, and the quota for paddy fields was one mu, but the women hoed one and a third mu of paddy field wheat a day, and more than one and a half mu of dry land wheat a day.
    Due to the great superiority of the People's Commune, this year's spring plowing and sowing work has surpassed that of previous years in every aspect. According to statistics, the autumn fields of the entire commune have been fertilized with an average of 400 dan per mu. All the autumn fields have been ploughed and harrowed. This year's sowing was ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. At present, comprehensive spring plowing and sowing have begun on a large scale. A spring plowing and sowing quality first competition is vigorously developing throughout the commune.

    Guangdong Hua County
    Guangzhou, April 20th (People's Daily report) - The people's communes in Hua County, Guangdong Province, have comprehensively implemented the system of unified leadership and graded management, mobilizing the positive factors within the communes, and spring plowing production has quickly shown an unprecedentedly vigorous new atmosphere. At present, more than 300,000 mu of land here has been covered with a dense green layer of tender seedlings of early rice, peanuts, sugarcane and other crops; tens of thousands of commune cadres, production team leaders and members are seizing the current opportunity when spring planting and sowing has just been completed, and immediately turning to mid-tillage weeding, seedling inspection and replanting, and topdressing with quick-acting fertilizer to strengthen field management.
    The six people's communes in Hua County seriously implemented methods such as unified leadership and graded management during the busy spring plowing in March. When many members discussed this issue, they said: "The people's commune has shown unparalleled superiority not long after its establishment. Now doing this again is really the icing on the cake." While discussing, they quickly increased the production measures for spring sowing and planting. Chini Commune, which averages about thirteen mu of land per labor force, has always been sloppy in its cultivation methods, with a maximum of two ploughings and two harrowings during spring plowing, but now it has increased to three ploughings and six harrowings. In order to apply more base fertilizer to the paddy fields, the Bajiang and Qishan production brigades of this commune even dismantled the old house mud at night to make fertilizer before transplanting rice seedlings. Some members traveled dozens of miles to other places to collect local miscellaneous fertilizers and rushed them back to the fields. The Huadong, Xinhua, and Tanbu communes originally had tens of thousands of mu of leisure fields that were not prepared for spring planting. After the production teams decided to restore these fields to planting early rice, the members immediately harrowed the fields, leveled the land, and delivered base fertilizer overnight, and replanted all the seeds, quickly transplanting the seedlings.
    The cadres at all levels of these communes, especially the production team leaders and members, are more concerned about the planting and management of early rice and various crops than in the past. Each production team has established an acceptance system during the transplanting of early rice seedlings, implementing "transplant one piece, manage one piece." Some teams found that the transplanted seedlings did not meet the specifications and immediately reworked them to ensure reasonable close planting of 400,000 to 500,000 seedlings per mu of basic farmland, and more than 300,000 seedlings per mu of non-basic farmland. When more than 90% of the county's 250,000 mu of early rice planting area had been completed, more than 170,000 mu of rice seedlings had been topdressed once to three times, and more than 70,000 mu had undergone mid-tillage weeding, while carrying out seedling inspection and replanting, and clearing barnyard grass.
    After the enthusiasm of the production team leaders and members of each commune in the county was fully exerted, the general cadres of the commune became more active and specific in their production leadership work. The party secretary of Xinhua Commune freed up more time to go deep into the key teams to inspect the field management of early rice, and discovered that the Dabu Production Team used the method of draining and drying fields to manage the rice seedlings in cold-bottom fields. While summoning old farmers to study this experience in the fields, they also conducted drainage management tests on various types of fields, and then promoted it throughout the commune. The party committees of five of the six communes in the county have established field headquarters, and most of the commune leading cadres have been sent there to directly guide field management. As soon as the Tanbu, Xinhua, and other communes discovered young stem borers, they immediately directed the teams to eliminate the pests. In addition to the small fertilizer plants and indigenous pesticide plants run by the production teams, the Huashan and other communes also uniformly established larger fertilizer plants and indigenous pesticide plants, producing large quantities of fertilizer and pesticides to support teams with poor production conditions. While planning to allocate some funds and fertilizers to support teams with poor foundations, each commune also sent additional leading cadres to help these teams develop production, and some teams have changed from backward teams to advanced teams during the field management stage.
    Based on the enthusiasm of everyone in these communes, they have launched a high-yield competition between teams and teams, groups and groups, and people and people, promoting the rapid and high-quality completion of spring planting, sowing, and crop management work. (Attached picture)

### 在统一领导下分级管理  在互助协作中等价交换  人民公社在春耕中进一步发挥优越性山西黎城

    在统一领导下分级管理  在互助协作中等价交换
    人民公社在春耕中进一步发挥优越性
    山西黎城
    本报太原20日电  山西省黎城县源庄人民公社，在当前春耕生产中，统一领导解决了一系列管理区无法解决的问题；同时，正确实行分级管理，充分发挥了群众的积极性。
    源庄人民公社分为八个管理区，春耕生产正紧张时，各管理区普遍缺乏农具，全社仅粪筐即缺五百余对。这些困难，一些管理区自己没有力量解决；一些管理区虽然有条件编造粪筐，修造农具，但因劳力不足，也办不到。为此，公社便在各管理区统一抽调了十四个劳力十七犋牲口，和有编造粪筐条件的管理区，进行变工互助，这样在几天之内，便编造了四百二十对粪筐，使各队都有了运送肥料的工具。公社统一经营的农具修造厂，集中力量，修制各种农具一千多件，基本上解决了全社农具不足的问题。
    播种中这个公社又在全社范围内，统一调剂了优良品种。比如，源庄管理区种的“鸡冠谷”，三年没有调换过种籽，平均每亩只产二百七十斤。后家山、朱家峻管理区种的“母鸡嘴”和“青谷”，平均每亩产三百九十二斤，公社便按照等价交换的原则，调给源庄一千七百斤优良谷种。骆驼沟大部分种当地玉茭，产量很低，公社就从源庄调去七百斤金皇后种子，保证大家适时播下了良种。
    源泉管理区有一条水渠，可以浇六个村的土地。过去浇地的办法是：谁浇地，谁看渠（怕跑水）。八里长的渠道，三个人浇地，就要七个人看渠。而且常常由于争先浇地，村与村之间发生吵嘴打架事件，水的浪费也很大。今年全公社统一组织了一支六人水利队，专管浇地，既省工，又省水。最近，全社二千亩小麦，十八天就浇完了拔节水；过去，二十五天时间才能浇完。事实证明：在公社统一领导下，最能合理地利用劳力、物力和财力。
    源庄公社在社员的食粮品种方面，还进行了调剂。过去，这里的情况是一部分村有谷子没麦子，另一部分村子有麦子没谷子。例如，东骆驼管理区谷子多、麦子少，每人平均只有二十斤小麦；而源庄管理区麦子多、谷子少，去年只收了七千斤谷子，苦于吃不到小米。因此，公社便按品种论价，进行调剂。
    源庄人民公社在春耕播种中，在监督各管理区完成国家种植计划方面也起了很大的作用。
    源庄公社在统一领导解决管理区无力解决的问题同时，还充分注意了实行分级管理，发挥每个管理区的作用，全公社八个管理区，都根据公社的统一计划，又因地制宜地确定了本管理区的具体指标，比如，源庄，五十亩管理区土地好，又有水利条件，便规定今年粮食亩产一千斤到一千五百斤，东骆驼等管理区条件较差，今年要达到粮食亩产六百斤。同时，各管理区都根据自己的指标，规定出实现指标的具体措施、劳力如何使用、每项农活的定额、完成每项农活的时间与具体要求。这样把公社的计划更加具体化，公社计划，真正变成了管理区的计划。因此，各管理区的生产积极性空前高涨，社员的出勤率都达到95％以上。特别是最近开展学天柱、赶天柱运动以来，社员经常超过定额。源泉管理区规定锄旱地小麦、一亩半为一个定额，水地一亩为一个定额，可是，妇女们锄水地小麦一天锄一亩三分，锄旱地小麦，一天锄一亩半还多。
    由于人民公社发挥了巨大的优越性，因此，今年的春耕播种工作，样样超过了往年。据统计，全公社秋田每亩已平均积肥四百担。秋田全部经过了耕耙。今年的播种比往年提前了十天到半月，目前，全面的春耕播种已经大规模开始。一个春耕播种质量第一的竞赛运动，正在全公社风起云涌地开展起来。

    广东花县
    本报广州20日电  广东省花县各人民公社全面执行统一领导、分级管理的制度，把公社内部的积极因素调动起来，春耕生产很快出现了空前蓬勃的新气象。目前，这里三十多万亩土地已经铺上一层浓绿色的早稻、花生、甘蔗等作物的嫩苗；数以万计的公社干部、生产队长和社员们，紧紧抓住当前春种春播刚完的时机，立刻转上中耕除草、查苗补苗和追施速效肥，加强田间管理工作。
    花县的六个人民公社，在3月春耕大忙中，认真执行了统一领导、分级管理等办法。很多社员讨论这一问题时，都说：人民公社成立不久已显出无比的优越性，如今再这样做，真的是锦上添花了。他们一边讨论，一边就赶快给春播春种的生产措施加码。平均每个劳动力大约担负十三亩田的赤坭公社，耕作方法一向粗放，春耕整田至多两犁两耙，但是现在却追加到三犁六耙。这个公社的巴江、岐山等生产大队为给稻田多施底肥，在插秧前还赶夜把旧屋坭拆下来制肥，有的社员更跑几十里路去外地搜集土杂肥回来，抢送下田。花东、新华、炭步等公社原有上万亩准备不作春种的休闲田，各个生产队决定让这些田恢复种早稻以后，社员们立刻连夜去耙田整地、送底肥，并把种子全部补播好，很快地插上秧苗。
    这些公社的各级干部特别是生产队长和社员，对早稻和各种作物的种植和管理工作比过去更加关心了，各个生产队在早稻插秧当中都建立了验收制度，实行插一块管一块。有些队发现插下的秧苗不符合规格，立即返工补课，保证了每亩基本农田合理密植达到四、五十万条苗，非基本农田每亩苗数也达到三十多万条。当全县二十五万亩早稻种植面积有九成多完成插秧的时候，已有十七万多亩禾苗经过一次至三次追肥，有七万多亩经过中耕除草，同时进行了查苗补苗、清除稗草等工作。
    全县各个公社在生产队长和社员们的积极性充分发挥后，公社一般干部对生产领导工作更加主动、具体了。新华公社的党委书记腾出更多的时间深入到重点队检查早稻田间管理工作，发现了大布生产队利用排水晒田方法管理冷底田的禾苗，长得特别浓绿的经验，一边召集老农在田头研究这个经验，一边作各类田的排水管理试验，再在全公社推广。全县六个公社已有五个公社的党委会建立了田头指挥部，把绝大部分的公社领导干部下放到那里直接指导田间管理工作。炭步、新华等公社一发现幼螟害虫，立即指挥各队扑灭了虫害。花山等公社除了生产队办的小型制肥厂、土农药厂之外，还统一兴办了较大的制肥厂和土农药厂，制出大量肥料和农药支援生产条件较差的队。各个公社一面规划好调拨部分资金、肥料支援基础较差的队，一面又加派了领导干部帮助这些队发展生产，有些队已在田间管理阶段由过去的后进队变成先进队。
    这些公社在人人干劲冲天的基础上，已经展开了队与队、组与组、人与人之间的高产竞赛，推动春种春播和作物管理工作做得又快又好。（附图片）
