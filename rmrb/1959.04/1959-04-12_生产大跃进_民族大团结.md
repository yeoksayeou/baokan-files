　　Great Leap Forward in Production, Great Unity of Nationalities
　　Liu Geping, Chairman of the People's Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
　　The Great Leap Forward in production and the great unity of nationalities are the basic situation in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region today.

　　In the extraordinary year of 1958, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution and realized an all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. Through the all-people rectification movement and the struggle against the Rightists, through the struggle to criticize localism and capitalist ideology, through the struggle to criticize Ma Zhenwu, an extreme rightist in the Hui religious community, and through the widespread socialist and communist education movement, the political consciousness of the people of all nationalities has greatly improved, the negative factors that were unfavorable to the socialist cause and the unity of nationalities have been overcome, and the relationship of unity and cooperation between the Han and Hui nationalities has been further developed. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of all nationalities are united and working together on the broad road of building socialism, and have achieved rapid development in the region's economic and cultural undertakings. In 1958, the total grain output of the region increased by 70% compared with 1957. The total industrial output value increased by more than double. Last year, in the autumn and winter, the people of all nationalities formed a 100,000-strong army of iron and steel, went up the mountains to smelt iron and steel, and completed the state-assigned task of iron and steel production. In 1958, primary school education was universalized throughout the region, the number of secondary school students increased by more than one and a half times, and three universities were established. Transportation, finance, trade and other work have also been developed accordingly. Last winter, the entire region realized the people's commune system, and 99.9% of the farmers in the region participated in the people's communes. The realization of the people's communes has played an unparalleled positive role in the development of production and construction, the improvement of the political and ideological level of the people of all nationalities, and the strengthening of national unity.

　　While various undertakings in the region have made a Great Leap Forward, the political, economic, and cultural outlook of the Hui nationality has also undergone rapid changes. Among the Hui people in the region, there are already more than 9,500 Communist Party members and more than 13,000 Communist Youth League members, more than 3,800 cadres who have left production, and more than 18,000 workers and staff members. According to statistics from seven Hui-populated counties and cities including Haiyuan, Xiji, Jingyuan, Wuzhong, and Tongxin, in 1958, the grain output in these areas increased by 69.3% compared with 1957, of which Haiyuan County increased by more than double; in 1958, thousands of industrial enterprises were established in these areas from scratch, with a total industrial output value reaching more than 18 million yuan; in 1958, the state's investment in capital construction in these areas increased by more than 270% compared with 1957, of which some counties saw an increase of six or seven times in capital construction investment; in 1958, the total number of Hui students in the region reached more than 74,000, an increase of 125% compared with 1957.

　　These achievements are a great victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction and a great victory for the Party's national policy. These achievements are changing the backward state of Ningxia and the Ningxia Hui nationality in terms of economy and culture, and are further strengthening and developing the unity and cooperation between the people of all nationalities in Ningxia. Now, the people of all nationalities in Ningxia are continuing to exert their revolutionary efforts, further strengthening their mutual unity and cooperation, and striving to achieve a Great Leap Forward in 1959!

　　Of course, the economic and cultural level of the Ningxia region is still relatively backward compared with advanced provinces and regions, and the economic and cultural level of the Ningxia Hui nationality is also relatively backward compared with the Han nationality within the region. However, we believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and with the support of the people of the whole country, as long as we make active efforts, the situation in the Ningxia region can be completely changed, and the Hui people will be able to catch up with the level of advanced nationalities.

　　Chairman Mao taught us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees that our cause will surely be victorious." The people of all nationalities in Ningxia have deeply realized the importance of strengthening national unity and helping each other and cooperating in socialist construction from their long-term personal experience, especially from the practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Due to the implementation of the Party's national policy and the active efforts of the people of all nationalities, the national unity in the Ningxia region has been greatly strengthened. With the realization of the people's communes and the leaping development of socialist construction, the national unity in the Ningxia region has entered a new stage. Due to the improvement of the political and ideological level of the people of all nationalities, they deeply experienced the consistency of mutual interests; due to the gradual overcoming of negative factors that were not conducive to national unity, the people of all nationalities have shown unprecedented activity and initiative in strengthening unity, friendship and mutual assistance; due to the establishment of people's communes, the cooperative relations among the people of all nationalities in terms of manpower, material resources, etc. have become more and more developed in the common labor of striving to realize the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. This has enabled the socialist unity among the people of all nationalities to achieve new development. The people of all nationalities warmly welcome this new progress in mutual relations and continue to actively promote it with their practical actions.

　　In the future, we should rely on the favorable organizational form of the people's communes to continue to strengthen socialist and communist education for the people of all nationalities, strengthen education in internationalism, patriotism, and national unity, strengthen the publicity and education of the Party's national policy, conscientiously and comprehensively implement the Party's national policy, continue to implement the policy of respecting the customs and habits of all nationalities and ensuring freedom of religious belief, actively promote the unity and cooperation of the people of all nationalities, enhance mutual understanding, consolidate the socialist national relations among all nationalities, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm of the people of all nationalities and jointly build a prosperous and happy autonomous region, and contribute more to the socialist construction of the great motherland!

　　生产大跃进  民族大团结
　　宁夏回族自治区人民委员会主席  刘格平
    生产大跃进，民族大团结，这是宁夏回族自治区当前的基本形势。
    宁夏回族自治区，在不平凡的1958年中，取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利，实现了社会主义建设的全面大跃进。经过全民整风运动和反右派斗争，经过批判地方主义和资本主义思想的斗争，经过批判回族宗教界极右分子马震武的斗争，经过广泛的社会主义和共产主义教育运动，各民族人民的政治觉悟大为提高，不利于社会主义事业和民族团结的消极因素得到了克服，回汉民族之间的团结关系和协作关系有了更进一步的发展。各民族人民在共产党的领导下，在建设社会主义的康庄大道上团结一致，共同努力，取得了自治区经济、文化事业的迅速发展。1958年全区粮食总产量比1957年增长了70％。工业总产值增长了一倍以上。各民族人民在去年秋冬组成十万钢铁大军，上山炼铁炼钢，完成了国家分配的钢铁生产任务。1958年全区普及了小学教育，中等学校学生人数增加了一倍半以上，筹建了三所高等学校。交通运输、财政贸易等工作也得到了相应的发展。去年冬季，全区实现了人民公社化，全区99.9％的农户参加了人民公社。人民公社化的实现，对于生产建设的发展、各民族人民政治思想水平的提高和民族团结的加强，都发挥了无比的积极作用。
    在全区各项事业大跃进的同时，回族的政治、经济、文化面貌也发生了迅速的变化。在全区回族当中，已经有了九千五百多名共产党员和一万三千多名共青团员，三千八百多名脱离生产的干部，一万八千多名职工。根据海原、西吉、泾源、吴忠、同心等七个回族聚居的县市的统计，1958年这些地区的粮食产量比1957年增长了69.3％，其中海原县增长了一倍以上；1958年这些地区从无到有地兴办了工业企业单位数千个，工业总产值达到一千八百多万元；1958年国家在这些地区的基本建设投资比1957年增长了270％多，其中有的县基本建设投资增长了六、七倍；1958年全区回族学生已达到七万四千多人，比1957年增长了125％。
    这些成就的取得，是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，是党的民族政策的伟大胜利。这些成就正在改变着宁夏地区和宁夏回族在经济、文化上的落后状况，并且进一步加强和发展了宁夏各民族人民的团结和协作关系。现在，宁夏各民族人民正在继续鼓足革命干劲，进一步加强相互间的团结和协作，为实现1959年的大跃进而努力！
    当然，宁夏地区的经济、文化水平，较之先进省、区仍然比较落后，宁夏回族的经济、文化水平，较之区内汉族也还比较落后。但是，我们相信，在中国共产党的领导下，在全国人民的支援下，只要我们积极努力，宁夏地区的状况是完全可以改变的，回族人民是能够赶上先进民族的水平的。
    毛主席教导我们说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证”。宁夏各民族人民，从自己长期的切身体验中，特别是从1958年大跃进的实践当中，深刻地认识到了加强民族团结，在社会主义建设中互相帮助、通力协作的重要意义。由于党的民族政策的贯彻执行和各民族人民的主动努力，宁夏地区的民族团结已经大大加强了。随着人民公社化的实现和社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，宁夏地区的民族团结关系已经进入了一个新的阶段。由于各民族人民政治思想水平的提高，他们深切体验到了相互利益的一致性，由于不利于民族团结的消极因素的逐渐克服，各民族人民在加强团结、友爱互助方面，都表现了空前的积极和主动；由于人民公社的建立，各民族人民在力争实现社会主义建设全面大跃进的共同劳动中，在人力、物力等方面的协作关系愈来愈发展了。这就使得各民族人民之间的社会主义的团结关系得到了新的发展。各民族人民热烈欢迎相互关系上的这种新的进步，并且不断以自己的实际行动积极加以促进。
    今后，我们应该依托人民公社这一有利的组织形式，继续加强对各民族人民的社会主义、共产主义教育，加强国际主义、爱国主义和民族团结的教育，加强党的民族政策的宣传教育，认真、全面地贯彻执行党的民族政策，继续贯彻尊重各民族的风俗习惯和保障宗教信仰自由的政策，积极促进各民族人民的团结和协作，增进相互之间的了解，巩固各民族之间的社会主义民族关系，以便充分发挥各民族人民的积极性，共同建设繁荣幸福的自治区，为伟大祖国的社会主义建设贡献更多的力量！
