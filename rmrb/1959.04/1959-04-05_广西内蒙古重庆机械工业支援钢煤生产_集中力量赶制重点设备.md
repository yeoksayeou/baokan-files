Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, April 4th: As of March 22nd, the Guangxi mechanical manufacturing industry system had basically produced 53 sets of coal mining equipment with an annual output of 30,000 to 50,000 tons, and 15 sets of coal washing equipment with an annual output of 150,000 tons. Electric double-drum windlasses, mine ventilators, high-pressure water pumps, coal crushers, belt conveyors, and supporting electric equipment in these complete sets have overfulfilled the first quarter's production plan.

Guangxi's first quarter's mechanical equipment production task was very heavy, equivalent to one and a half times the autonomous region's completed task last year. In the face of heavy tasks, insufficient materials, and limited processing capacity, the Autonomous Region Party Committee prioritized key and non-key tasks according to their urgency and importance, deciding to first ensure the production of coal equipment. Mechanical manufacturing factories and enterprises in various regions also resolutely implemented the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard, ensuring the key points," cooperating closely, and "stopping production to make way" for all non-key products, giving priority to key points in terms of raw materials and manpower allocation. Liuzhou City, one of Guangxi's major mechanical industrial bases, had heavy production tasks in the first quarter, but thanks to the unified allocation of raw materials by the CPC Liuzhou Municipal Committee, the factories undertaking the task of manufacturing coal equipment were able to carry out production according to plan. Nanning Iron Factory, which is mainly responsible for manufacturing coal mine equipment, had already arranged its quarterly production plan when it received the task of manufacturing coal mining equipment for Guangxi's key coal mine – Fusui Coal Mine. However, after full discussion by the factory's employees, based on the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard," they clarified the importance of manufacturing equipment, temporarily put aside the tasks that had been arranged, and prioritized the production of coal mine equipment, finally completing the task on schedule.

In the process of rushing to produce coal mine equipment, the workers of Guangxi's mechanical factories fully utilized their initiative and enthusiasm. At the beginning of manufacturing, there was a lack of drawings for some parts, so each mechanical factory sent people to collect them from other places or drew them according to existing physical samples. Liuzhou Manufacturing Factory needed ball bearings of different specifications for manufacturing belt conveyors, but they were not available on the market for a while, so the workers made a batch of ball bearings themselves; lacking five 250 mm diameter medium-forged steel main shafts for producing animal-powered hoists, they used other materials instead; lacking large-scale forging equipment in production, the workers in the forging workshop launched a movement to make indigenous machine tools, independently designing and equipping a 500 kg air hammer, solving the difficulties and forging ten rough shafts. Thanks to the efforts of the workers in various factories, Guangxi has now not only completed the manufacturing of general supporting equipment, but also successfully trial-produced important coal equipment such as high-pressure water pumps, explosion-proof motors, and double-drum windlasses, which they had never produced before and were technically complex and required high precision, and have begun mass production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 4th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's mechanical industry is taking measures to speed up the production of six major equipments.

Among the six major equipments that the autonomous region will complete this year are rolling mills with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel and 50,000 tons of steel, simple coal washing equipment with an annual output of 300,000 tons, as well as coking equipment, mining equipment, and irrigation and drainage equipment. These equipments are required to be completed in April to May respectively.

In order to ensure the completion of these equipment manufacturing tasks, the Autonomous Region has established a production office for the six major equipments, and sent working groups to factories to help solve problems in production. The production office also assisted the factories in drawing up progress schedules for each of the six major equipments, item by item, day by day, ten days at a time, and month by month, establishing a responsibility system, designating special personnel to be responsible for ensuring timely delivery. The Autonomous Region has carefully calculated the raw materials needed for manufacturing the six major equipments, uniformly allocated them, and cleared the warehouses, giving full play to the potential of existing materials, and ensuring timely supply.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 4th: Chongqing's mechanical factories are stepping up the production of key equipment. Two hundred and twenty water pumps, two hundred electric motors, blowers and fixed screens and other equipment manufactured by Chongqing Water Pump Factory, Chongqing Motor Factory, Yangjiaping Machine Factory and XinJian Machine Factory and other units, have been shipped ahead of schedule. Sanlian Diesel Engine Factory, Xiyuan Motor Factory and other units have also produced a batch of diesel engines, gas engines and other irrigation and drainage machinery.

In order to complete the manufacturing tasks of this batch of equipment ahead of schedule, the workers of each factory carried out technical revolution and launched labor competitions enthusiastically. The workers of the third workshop of Chongqing Water Pump Factory, the machinists, fitters, and assembly teams, strengthened cooperation in the competition, so that the various processes were closely linked. When the processing could not keep up with the assembly, the assembly workers took the initiative to assist the fitters and machinists in processing parts. The workers of this factory also cooperated with the technical personnel to change the structure of the K-shaped water pump, reducing the number of parts per water pump from 119 to 70 while ensuring quality. This can save 800 tons of pig iron, more than 100 tons of steel and copper throughout the year, while shortening the processing time. In the process of manufacturing diesel engines, the workers of Chongqing Sanlian Diesel Engine Factory built an indigenous blast furnace by themselves, remelting the white pig iron back into the furnace to ensure the quality of the castings.

For the key equipment that has not yet been completed, all factories have taken measures to speed up the manufacturing progress. In order to complete the equipment of the coking plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, the workers of Chang'an Machine Factory drew out ten engineers and six technicians to specifically sort out and study the drawings, and also established four commando teams to be specifically responsible for manufacturing. In the process of rushing to produce coking equipment, the workers of Jiangling Machine Factory designated special personnel in each workshop to report the production progress to the factory headquarters every eight hours, so that the factory headquarters could discover and solve production problems in a timely manner.

    广西内蒙古重庆机械工业支援钢煤生产
    集中力量赶制重点设备
    新华社南宁4日电　广西机械制造工业系统职工截至3月22日止，已经基本制成年产三至五万吨的采煤设备五十三套，年产十五万吨的洗煤设备十五套。这些成套设备中的电动双筒卷扬机，矿井通风机、高压水泵、碎煤机、皮带运输机以及配套电动等已经超额完成第一季度的生产计划。
    广西第一季度的机械设备生产任务十分繁重，相当自治区去年完成任务的一倍半。在任务重、材料不足、加工力量有限的情况下，自治区党委对按轻重缓急先后进行了重点与非重点的排队，确定首先保证煤炭设备的生产。各地机械制造工厂、企业也坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋，保证重点”的思想，通力协作，一切非重点产品都“停车让路”，在原料和力量调配等方面首先保证重点。广西主要机械工业基地之一的柳州市，第一季度生产任务虽然繁重，由于中共柳州市委统一调拨了原材料，使担负煤炭设备制造任务的各工厂，都能按计划地进行生产。担负煤矿设备主要制造任务的南宁铁工厂，当接受了为广西重点煤矿——扶绥煤矿制造采煤设备的任务时，本厂已安排好了季度生产计划，但全厂职工经过充分讨论，根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，明确制造设备的重要意义，把已经安排好的任务暂时放下，优先赶制煤矿设备，终于按期完成了任务。
    广西各机械工厂职工在赶制煤矿设备中，充分发挥了积极性和主动精神。在开始制造时，缺乏部分零件的图纸，各机械厂就派人到外地收集或按照现有实物样本进行描绘。柳州制造厂制造皮带运输机需用不同规格的滚珠轴承，在市场上一时买不到，职工们就自制了一批滚珠轴承；制造畜力提升机缺乏五条二百五十公厘直径的中煏钢主轴，他们就改用其他材料来代替；生产中缺乏大型锻压设备，锻工车间职工就大搞土机床运动，自行设计，配制一台五百公斤的空气锤，解决了困难，锻出十条粗轴。由于各工厂职工的努力，现在广西不但完成了一般的配套设备制造，而且把过去从没有生产过的，技术复杂，精密度要求很高的高压水泵、防爆马达，双筒卷扬机等重要的煤炭设备也试制成功了，并且开始成批生产。
    新华社呼和浩特4日电　内蒙古自治区机械工业采取措施加紧赶制六大设备。
    自治区今年要完成的六大设备中，有年产十万吨钢材和年产五万吨钢材的轧钢机，有年产三十万吨的简易洗煤设备，以及炼焦设备、矿山设备、排灌设备等。这些设备要求分别在4月到5月完成。
    为了确保这些设备制造任务的完成，自治区专门成立了六大设备的生产办公室，同时派工作组下厂帮助解决生产中的问题。生产办公室还协助各厂对六大设备逐项、逐件地按日、按旬、按月排出进度表，建立责任制，指定专人负责，保证定期交货。对于制造六大设备所需要的原材料，自治区进行了精细核算，统一调配，并且清理仓库，充分发挥现有物资的潜力，及时保证了供应。
    新华社重庆4日电　重庆各机械工厂正加紧赶制重点设备。重庆水泵厂、重庆电机厂、杨家坪机器厂和新建机器厂等单位制造的二百二十台水泵，二百台电动机、鼓风机和固定筛等设备，已经提前出厂。三联柴油机厂、西原电机厂等单位也制成了一批柴油机、煤气机等排灌机械。
    各厂职工为提前完成这批设备的制造任务大搞技术革命，热烈开展了劳动竞赛。重庆水泵厂三车间的车工、钳工和装配组的工人在竞赛中加强了协作，使各个工序紧密联系起来，遇到加工赶不上装配时，装配工人就主动地协助钳工和车工加工零件。这个厂的工人还和技术人员合作，改变了K形水泵的结构，在保证质量的前提下使每台水泵的零件由一百一十九个改为七十个，全年可以因此节约八百吨生铁，一百多吨钢材和铜，同时缩短了加工时间。重庆三联柴油机厂的职工在制造柴油机过程中，自己动手修起了一座土高炉，将白口铁回炉重炼，保证了铸件质量。
    对目前还没有完成的重点设备，各厂都采取了措施，加快制造进度。长安机器厂职工为完成重庆钢铁公司焦化厂的设备，抽出了十个工程师、六个技术员专门整理研究图纸，还成立了四个突击工作队专门负责制造。江陵机器厂职工在赶制炼焦设备中，各车间都指定专人每八小时向厂部汇报一次生产进展情况，以便厂部能及时发现和解决生产中的问题。
