Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Saigon News: The lackey of U.S. imperialism, the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique, obeying the will of its master, clamors to separate Tibet from China.

Ngo Dinh Diem’s "government" recently issued a statement saying that it "morally fully supports the Tibetan people's heroic struggle for independence." In the statement, it also incited other countries to participate in this conspiracy to split China. It said that the "government" hopes that "other countries that believe in justice and peace will do the same." It also said that South Vietnam is ready to help the Tibetan insurgents "in every possible way." Ngo Dinh Diem's rubber stamp, the South Vietnamese "National Assembly," subsequently passed a resolution stating that it "firmly supports the heroic struggle of the Tibetan people for 'independence and freedom'," and slandered China's peaceful policies. It even turned black and white upside down, falsely accusing China of "wanting to use the so-called policy of peaceful coexistence to deceive world public opinion, and is using force to infringe upon the people's right to strive for self-determination."

Some reactionary groups in South Vietnam, such as the South Vietnam General Association of the "Asian Anti-Communist League," the South Vietnam "United Buddhist Association," veterans' groups, and some reactionary newspapers, followed the rhythm of Ngo Dinh Diem's baton, singing the tune of so-called "free countries" coming forward to interfere in China's internal affairs.

    吴庭艳集团遵从美国主子意旨
    公开叫嚣支持西藏的叛乱分子
    新华社23日讯  西贡消息：美帝国主义的奴仆、南越吴庭艳集团遵从它的主子的意旨，叫嚣要把西藏从中国分裂出去。
    吴庭艳的“政府”最近发表声明说它“在道义上完全支持西藏人民争取独立的英勇斗争”。它在声明中还鼓动其他国家参加这种分裂中国的阴谋活动。它说“政府”希望“相信正义与和平的其他国家也这样做”。它还说南越准备“以一切可能的方法”来帮助西藏叛乱分子。吴庭艳的橡皮图章、南越的“国会”随后也通过一项决议说它“坚决支持西藏人民争取‘独立和自由’的英勇斗争”，并且诽谤中国的和平政策。它竟颠倒黑白地污蔑中国“想利用所谓和平共处政策欺骗世界舆论，并且正在利用武力侵犯人民争取自决的权利”。
    南越一些反动团体如“亚洲反共联盟”南越总会、南越“佛教协会联合会”、退伍军人团体以及一些反动报纸，按照吴庭艳指挥棒挥动的节拍，唱起所谓“自由国家”出面干涉中国内政的曲调。
