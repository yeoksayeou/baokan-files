　　Accumulate More High-Quality Fertilizer for Spring-Sown Crops
    During the winter and spring fertilizer accumulation and production upsurge, the amount of fertilizer accumulated and produced in various regions has increased several times compared to the same period last year, and the quality has also significantly improved. At the same time, high-yield movement is widely carried out throughout the country; in order to strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops, many areas have used the vast majority of fertilizer on summer-ripening crops. According to statistics from Zhejiang, more than 60% of the more than 6.1 billion dan of standard fertilizer accumulated by the end of March has been used in spring-flowering fields. It is of course right to provide sufficient fertilizer for summer-ripening crops; the question is how to further ensure that other crops, especially spring-sown crops, have enough fertilizer. According to a survey by Zhejiang Province of more than 530,000 mu of early rice high-yield fields with more than 2,000 jin last year, the fertilizer used was around 200 dan, and 80% was base fertilizer. At present, the fertilizer for early rice crops in Zhejiang Province is only 120 dan of crude fertilizer per mu. According to this year's high-yield requirements for early rice, there is a big difference.
    Emergency action is needed to launch a crash fertilizer accumulation campaign for spring-sown crops!
    Things are always developing forward. Using the standards of the past, the fertilizer this year has increased several times compared to the same period last year, which is indeed a great achievement. However, using this year's needs for a great leap forward in agricultural production as a standard, we feel that it is still insufficient. We must advance on the crest of victory and prepare more fertilizer for spring-sown crops. Spring-sown crops account for a large proportion of the whole year's production in most parts of the country. The masses also attach great importance to this season's crops, solemnly calling them "large ripening crops" and "large autumn crops." Various places in Zhejiang Province have checked the preparation of base fertilizer for early rice, and according to the requirements of high-yield targets for early rice, they have decided to seize the gap before the busy season of transplanting to urgently prepare base fertilizer for early rice. This approach is timely and necessary. In the crash fertilizer accumulation, they emphasize the accumulation of high-quality fertilizer and high-speed fertilizer, and emphasize the working methods of leadership participation, layer-by-layer demonstration, and following the mass line, which are also correct. All localities should make full use of the gaps in spring plowing and spring sowing, and according to the requirements of high-yield increase of spring-sown crops, launch another short-term crash movement of fertilizer accumulation and production.

### 给春播作物积造更多的优质肥料

　　给春播作物积造更多的优质肥料
    在冬春积肥造肥高潮中，各地积造的肥料比去年同期成倍地增加，质量也显著提高。同时，全国各地都广泛地开展高额丰产运动；为了争取夏季作物大丰收，很多地区已把绝大部分肥料用到夏熟作物上。据浙江统计，到3月底积造的六十一亿多担标准肥中，60％以上已用到春花田里去。供给夏熟作物充分的肥料当然是应该的；问题是怎样进一步保证其他作物、首先是春播作物有足够的肥料。据浙江省对去年五十三万多亩二千斤以上的早稻丰产田的调查，所用的肥料都在二百担左右，而且80％是基肥。目前浙江早稻作物的肥料，每亩只有一百二十担粗肥。按今年早稻高额增产要求，是相差很大的。
    需要紧急行动起来，给春播作物突击积肥！
    事物总是不断往前发展的。用过去的标准来检查，今年的肥料比去年同期已成倍地增加，确实成绩很大。但是用今年农业生产大跃进的需要作标准来检查，则又感到不足。必须乘胜前进，给春播作物准备更多的肥料。春播作物对于全国大多数地区来说在全年的生产中都占很大的比重。群众也十分重视这一季作物，隆重地称之为“大熟作物”“大秋作物”。浙江省各地检查了早稻基肥的准备情况，按照早稻高额丰产指标的要求，决定抓紧插秧大忙前的空隙，为早稻突击准备基肥。这种作法是适时的，必要的。他们在突击积肥中强调积造优质肥、高速效肥，强调领导动手、层层示范、走群众路线的工作方法，也是正确的。各地都应充分利用春耕、春播的间隙，根据春播作物高额增产的要求，再展开一次积肥造肥的短期突击运动。
