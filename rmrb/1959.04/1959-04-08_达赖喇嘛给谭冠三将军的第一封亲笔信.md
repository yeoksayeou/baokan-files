Dalai Lama's First Handwritten Letter to General Tan Guansan

The first handwritten letter from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan, dated March 11. This letter was written by the Dalai Lama below the Tibetan translation of General Tan Guansan's letter to the Dalai Lama on the 10th. The letter was written in steel pen and blue ink. The first ten lines are the Tibetan translation of General Tan Guansan's letter. From the second half of the tenth line to the end is the Dalai Lama's handwritten letter. The original is 26.3 cm long and 18.7 cm wide. The full Chinese translation of the letter is as follows:

Dear Comrade Political Commissar Tan:

Yesterday, I decided to go to the military region to see a play, but due to the instigation of a few bad people, and the fact that the monks and laypeople did not understand the truth and followed suit, obstructing me, I was indeed unable to visit, which made me ashamed and anxious, and I was at a loss. You did not mind at all, and the letter you sent appeared before my eyes, instantly filling me with excitement.

The reactionary bad elements are using the excuse of protecting my safety to carry out activities that endanger me. I am trying to quell this. In a few days, when the situation stabilizes, I will definitely meet with you. If you have any internal instructions for me, please frankly inform me through this person.

Respectfully presented by the Dalai Lama

    达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的第一封亲笔信
    达赖喇嘛3月11日给谭冠三将军的第一封亲笔信。这封信是达赖喇嘛写在谭冠三将军10日给达赖喇嘛的信的藏文译文下面的，信是用钢笔和蓝墨水写。从第一行到第十行前半部分是谭冠三将军信的藏文译文。从第十行后半部分起到末尾是达赖喇嘛的亲笔信。原件长二十六公分三，宽十八公分七。全信汉文译文如下：亲爱的谭政委同志：
    昨天我决定去军区看戏，但由于少数坏人的煽动，而僧俗人民不解真象追随其后，进行阻拦，确实无法去访，使我害羞难言，忧虑交加，而处于莫知所措的境地。您毫不计较，送来的信出现在我眼前时，顿时感到无限的兴奋。
    反动的坏分子们正在借口保护我的安全而进行着危害我的活动。对此我正设法平息。几天以后，情况安定了，一定同您见面。您对我有何内部的指示，请通过此人坦率示知。
              达赖喇嘛亲笔呈
