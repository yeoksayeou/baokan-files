    I completely agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports of the congress. This congress is a congress of unity, a congress of great leap forward, and I think it is also a congress celebrating a great harvest.
    Our country has been established for less than ten years, and under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, it has achieved tremendous and brilliant achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Due to the overfulfillment of the first five-year plan, our country has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. In particular, in 1958, our vast rural areas realized the people's commune system and achieved a great victory in the nationwide great leap forward. Steel production reached 11.08 million tons, and the output of grain, cotton, and other products doubled, which made it possible for us to realize our country's industrialization at a faster pace. With the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the cultural revolution has entered a new climax. At present, all localities are vigorously implementing the Party's education policy of serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor. On the education front, a hundred flowers are blooming and ten thousand horses are galloping, and the education cause has developed by leaps and bounds. Due to the correct implementation of the Party's education policy, in the past year alone, 1,240 counties across the country have popularized primary school education, and the number of primary school students has reached 86 million, accounting for 85 percent of school-age children. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and the government and the enthusiasm of the people, this arduous task has been completed.
    Cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture
    In the past year, the Party's complete set of policies of "walking on two legs" has achieved great results not only in production and construction but also in education. Under the leadership of the Party, all educators are working hard to closely integrate education with productive labor. Using this policy, we will train our youth into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.
    In the past year, the communist consciousness of teachers and students has been greatly improved, and the tendency of education being divorced from politics and productive labor has been basically reversed. Through rectification, the anti-rightist movement, and participation in productive labor, various forms of bourgeois individualism and bourgeois educational ideas expressed in work have been criticized. The current situation is that the majority of teachers firmly support the leadership of the Party, actively implement the Party's education policy, and happily do the work assigned to them by the leadership. The ranks of teachers are more united than before. In teaching work, the tendency to only pay attention to knowledge education while neglecting political and ideological education has been basically reversed. Some teachers said: "The process of implementing the Party's education policy is the process of self-ideological transformation." Other teachers said: "Now I truly understand what kind of people we should cultivate."
    On the student side, according to my understanding, many schools have added political classes in the fifth and sixth grades, unified the content of weekly meetings and class meetings in each grade, and organized students to actively participate in various political activities, public welfare labor, and productive labor. In this regard, the Young Pioneers organization has done a lot of work. Through classroom teaching and extracurricular activities, teachers have also strengthened the education of students on the four viewpoints, especially the labor viewpoint and the collectivist viewpoint. The result of education is that children love labor more, and the situation of disliking dirt and fearing fatigue has basically changed. Labor is glorious has become the children's actual action. Last spring, the Young Pioneers actively responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and participated in the tree planting and afforestation movement. The Young Pioneers of Heilongjiang Province built an 84-li youth shelterbelt along the Heilongjiang River. The school I work in—Beijing Second Experimental Primary School—taking teaching as the center, established a small factory. Last year, it produced 5,500 toy jigsaw puzzles and 2,000 toy cars. This year, our school plans to produce more than 6,000 pieces of bookends, newspaper clips, and pencil boxes for the Cultural and Educational Supplies Company. During my inspection in Chengdu and Chongqing, I visited several primary schools, and the activities related to productive labor were generally well done. Students in the third grade and above in Chengdu Experimental Primary School and Chongqing Renhe Street Primary School all participated in four hours of labor per week in small factories, including carpentry, weaving, making ink, making cakes, hairdressing, pasting paper boxes, making rayon, and farm labor, etc. Most schools are linked with factories or farms and have invited instructors from factories and farms to be counselors. Teachers told me: "We have three gains in doing this: workers and peasants personally guide, which not only solves the problem of teachers for the school's productive labor courses, but also allows teachers and students to directly approach workers and peasants, which is convenient for learning from workers and peasants. This is one gain; factories and farms get a lot of student auxiliary labor, which accelerates production and construction, which is also one gain; it cultivates a large number of well-rounded talents for the country, which is another gain. A few days ago, the People's Daily published an article about the interesting experiments conducted by thirteen- and fourteen-year-old children at Qingtou Primary School in Yuncheng County. They combined the knowledge learned from natural science and agricultural knowledge classes and thought about how to make wheat grow more and better. Under the encouragement and guidance of their teachers, they grafted wheat with alfalfa, chrysanthemum, sweet potato, potato, etc., and hybridized it with corn, sorghum, etc. There are now thirteen surviving species.
    Implementing the Party's education policy, the quality of school teaching has been greatly improved
    Through labor and political and ideological education, the atmosphere of mutual assistance and friendship among students has been strengthened, and they have a stronger affection for labor. They love the Party more, and they know that without the Communist Party, there would be no socialism.
    Since the implementation of the Party's education policy, the quality of education in schools has been greatly improved. According to the survey of several schools, student test scores were better in 1958 than in 1957, and better in the second half of last year than in the first half. After participating in productive labor, students' academic performance not only did not decline but also made great progress. After the Great Leap Forward, students' composition scores in various schools have improved significantly. Fifth and sixth grade students at Chengdu Experimental Primary School in Sichuan can generally write 700 to 800 words, and some can even write more than 1,000 words. Students have written many songs praising the Great Leap Forward. Ideological content has been strengthened in teaching. In the activity of opposing the U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan, second grade elementary school students wrote a poem: "U.S. imperialism, don't show off, we will poke a big hole in you soon." After more than a year of work, the teachers of our school have attached importance to summarizing their own work experiences and have summarized the "five combinations" teaching method (combining teacher guidance with stimulating student enthusiasm; combining teaching understanding in class with timely correction of homework; combining studying teaching materials with in-depth understanding of students; combining new instruction with review and inspection; combining independent thinking with teacher assistance). In addition, how theory can be linked to practice, and how knowledge can be linked to ideological education, teachers have deeply summarized and studied, laying the foundation for a greater leap forward in the work of 1959.
    Last year was a double harvest of learning and labor, and this year we will continue the Great Leap Forward
    In short, in the past year, the ideological awareness of teachers and students has been significantly improved, and their enthusiasm and drive have been particularly great. They listen to the Party, and wherever the Party points, they rush there. This proves that only with the leadership of the Party can the socialist education cause be developed and improved, and can we achieve such great harvests as last year. Therefore, all this should first be attributed to the leadership of the Party. The Great Leap Forward in education in 1958 was a double harvest of learning and labor, transforming the "three separations" into "three combinations" (education combined with productive labor, combined with reality, and combined with ideological education). In the past year, local education administrative departments, under the leadership of the local Party committees, organized manpower to adapt or compile teaching materials and reference materials, and established boarding schools, etc. These tasks have achieved great results and solved the difficulties of some parents. After students live in the school, the quality of learning has improved and the collectivist viewpoint has been cultivated. At the same time, due to the collective living system, students are more united and healthier.
    In the past few years, especially in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, education work has achieved great results, but the development of cultural and educational work is far from meeting the requirements of our country's rapid Great Leap Forward. Now it is necessary to carry out a lot of rectification, consolidation, and improvement work on the basis of this great development, and to continue to strive for greater victories in 1959 on the basis of the great victory in 1958. In 1959, the general task of our school is to continue to deeply study the Party's education policy, strive to improve the quality of education, organize children to participate in diversified productive labor within their ability according to their age characteristics, and arrange the time for teachers and students to work, study, labor, rest, and sleep more comprehensively and reasonably, in order to promote a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.
    In terms of teaching, the task we have put forward is: to strive to improve the quality of teaching, to seriously and systematically summarize teaching experience, and to boldly reform teaching methods. We require teachers to teach well and students to learn well, so that the academic performance in 1959 will improve by one step compared to 1958, and to reach the standards set in the syllabus.
    In terms of education, the tasks we have put forward are: to continue to implement the rules for primary school students, to strengthen the education of the four viewpoints, especially the labor viewpoint and the collectivist viewpoint, to further cultivate students' labor habits, and to further establish students' collectivist thinking. Cultivate students' communist moral qualities such as politeness, honesty, and humility.
    In order to complete the above tasks, all teachers in our school are working hard to improve their political and theoretical level, continue to deepen ideological transformation, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology on the education front, and resolutely guarantee the leadership of the Party, so that education work can adapt to the requirements of the development level of our country's productive forces. At present, in our school, the struggle between the two ideologies and the two methods has not been completely resolved. We must be constantly vigilant against the rise of backward and conservative thinking, vigorously overcome bourgeois educational ideas and individualistic thinking, conscientiously study the Party's policies and policies in education work, resolutely implement the Party's education policy and the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party, and conduct educational revolution in a planned way. While strengthening ideological transformation, teachers are also working hard to improve their professional level, seizing spare time, and combining work with studying pedagogy and psychology. In work, closely rely on the Party, give play to the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and strive to become an educational worker who is both red and expert in the socialist cause.
    The task in 1959 is great and arduous. The facts in 1958 prove that the policy of "walking on two legs" has achieved great success in education work. In the future, we must continue to implement this policy, just as the Premier pointed out:
  "The development of our country's education cause must adopt the method of combining popularization and improvement. In order to realize the popularization of culture, in order to be able to adapt to the urgent needs of the development of the current national construction cause, in addition to full-time regular schools at all levels, we should also continue to develop half-day schools and spare-time schools in rural areas and factories and mines according to actual possibilities. Mass literacy work should be actively promoted. At the same time, we must pay special attention to improving the quality of teaching in various schools." All teachers, local education administrative departments, and education workers in our country must strive to complete this glorious task. Let us continue to go all out, aim high, and use our work to promote the Great Leap Forward in our country's cultural and educational cause, welcome the socialist cultural upsurge that has already begun in our country, and welcome the tenth anniversary of our great motherland.
    Any reactionary forces who want to engage in conspiracies in Tibet will be completely defeated
    The rebellion launched by the reactionary elements of the upper strata in Tibet against the motherland recently has made teachers and students across the country feel extremely angry. Tibet is an inseparable part of the motherland, and Tibetan compatriots are also members of the big family of all ethnic groups in the motherland. Now the reactionary elements are clamoring that Tibet is an independent country, which is completely nonsense. This is purely the old trick of imperialism. We have long recognized this trick of imperialism.
    The rebellion launched by the reactionary elements of the upper strata in Tibet is a completely shameful act of betraying the motherland. They are the enemies of all our ethnic groups. We teachers and primary school students across the country resolutely support the government's dissolution of the original local government of Tibet and resolutely support the People's Liberation Army's suppression of the rebellion. Whether it is the reactionary elements of the upper strata in Tibet, the Chiang Kai-shek elements, or the imperialist elements, any reactionary forces who want to play tricks and engage in conspiracies in Tibet will be completely defeated.
    Now, the Tibetan people have begun a new life. This is a very good thing. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, the Tibetan people will build a beautiful new Tibet and build a happy and beautiful life.

    教育战线上万马奔腾
    陶淑范代表的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和大会其他各项报告。这个大会是个团结的大会，是个跃进的大会，我认为还是个庆祝大丰收的大会。
    我们国家建国以来还不到十年，在党和毛主席的领导下，已经在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面，获得了巨大的、辉煌的成就。由于第一个五年计划的超额完成，我国已建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。特别是一九五八年我国广大农村实现了人民公社化，取得了全国全面大跃进的伟大胜利，钢的生产量达到一千一百零八万吨，粮食、棉花等产品的产量翻了一番，这使得我们有可能以更快的速度，实现我国工业化。随着工农业大跃进，文化革命已进入了一个新的高潮，目前各地正轰轰烈烈地贯彻执行着党的教育为工人阶级政治服务、教育与劳动生产相结合的教育方针。在教育战线上百花齐放、万马奔腾，教育事业有了飞跃的发展。由于正确贯彻党的教育方针，仅去年一年的时间，全国已有一千二百四十个县普及了小学教育，小学生人数达到八千六百万人，占学龄儿童的百分之八十五。由于党和政府的领导，人民群众的积极性，因而完成了这项艰巨的任务。
    培养有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者
    一年来，党的“两条腿走路”的一整套方针，不仅在生产建设方面，而且在教育工作方面也取得了很大的成绩。全体教育工作者在党的领导下，正在努力把教育与生产劳动紧密的结合起来。运用这一方针，把我国青少年培养成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者。
    一年来，师生的共产主义觉悟大大的提高了，基本上扭转了教育脱离政治和教育脱离生产劳动的倾向。经过整风、反右运动和参加了生产劳动，形形色色的资产阶级个人主义的思想和表现在工作方面的资产阶级教育思想，受到了批判。现在的情况是，大多数教师坚决拥护党的领导，积极贯彻党的教育方针，愉快的做着领导分配给自己的工作。教师的队伍比以前更团结了。在教学工作中，只重视知识教育而忽视政治思想教育的倾向，基本上扭转了。有的教师说：“贯彻党的教育方针的过程，就是自我思想改造的过程。”还有的教师说：“现在才真正认识了我们要培养什么样的人。”
    学生方面，据我了解有不少学校在五、六年级都增加了政治课，统一安排了各年级周会、班会的内容，组织学生积极的参加了各种政治活动、公益劳动和生产劳动。在这方面，少先队组织做了很多工作。通过课堂教学和课外活动，教师们还加强了对学生的四个观点的教育，特别是劳动观点和集体主义观点的教育。教育的结果，使孩子们更热爱劳动，嫌脏怕累的情况基本上改变了，劳动光荣已成为孩子们的实际行动。去年春天，少先队员们积极响应了团中央的号召，参加了植树造林运动。黑龙江省的少先队员们在黑龙江边造起了八十四里少年林荫道。我工作的那个学校——北京第二实验小学以教学为中心，设立了小工厂，去年生产玩具拼图盒五千五百个，小汽车二千辆。今年我校又计划为文教用品公司生产书档、报夹子、铅笔盒六千多件。我这次到成都、重庆等地视察，看了几个小学，有关生产劳动的活动，一般都搞的很好。成都实验小学和重庆人和街小学三年级以上的学生，都参加了小工厂每周四小时的劳动，内容有木工、编织、做墨水、做蛋糕、理发、糊纸盒、做人造棉和小农场劳动等多样的力所能及的劳动。大多数学校和工厂或农场挂钩，并请了工厂和农场的指导员做辅导员，教师对我说：“我们这样做有三得：工农同志亲自指导，不但为学校生产劳动课解决了师资问题，同时教师和学生都直接接近了工农同志，便于向工农学习，这是一得；工厂和农场得到很多学生辅助劳动，加速了生产建设，也是一得；为国家培养了大量的、全面发展的人才，又是一得。前几天，人民日报登载的运城县卿头小学十三、四岁的小朋友们做了许多有趣的试验，他们结合了自然课和农业常识课学到的知识，想着如何使麦子长的更多更好，他们在老师的鼓励和指导下，把小麦分别和苜蓿、千层花、甘薯、马铃薯等嫁接，并且和玉米、高粱等杂交，现在已经成活的有十三种。
    贯彻党的教育方针，学校教学质量大大提高
    通过劳动，通过政治思想教育，在学生间互助友爱的气氛加强了，对劳动有了更浓厚的感情，他们对党更加热爱了，他们知道没有共产党就没有社会主义。
    从贯彻了党的教育方针以后，学校的教育质量，有了很大的提高。通过对几个学校的调查，学生考试成绩，一九五八年比一九五七年好，去年下半年比上半年好。参加生产劳动以后，学生学习成绩不但没有退步，而且有了很大的进步。大跃进以后，各校学生作文成绩有了显著的提高。四川成都实验小学五、六年级学生，作文一般都能写七百到八百字，还有的能写一千多字，学生写了很多歌颂大跃进的事。教学中思想性加强了，我校在反对美帝侵略台湾的活动中，二年级小学生写了一首诗：“美帝你别逞威风，不久给你戳个大窟窿”。经过一年多的工作，我校的教师们重视了总结自己工作中的点滴经验，总结出“五结合”的教学方法（教师主导与启发学生积极性相结合；当堂讲懂与及时批改作业相结合；钻研教材与深入了解学生相结合；新授与复习检查相结合；独立思考与教师帮助相结合）。另外，理论如何联系实际，知识如何联系思想教育，教师们都深入的总结和进行了研究，为一九五九年的工作更大的跃进打下了基础。
    去年学习劳动双丰收，今年继续大跃进
    总而言之，一年来教师和学生思想觉悟有了显著的提高，积极性和干劲特别大，听党的话，党指向哪里就奔向哪里，这就证实了只有党的领导，社会主义的教育事业才能得到发展和提高，才能取得像去年这样大的收获。因此，这一切应当首先归功于党的领导。一九五八年教育工作的大跃进，学习劳动双丰收，变三脱离为三结合（教育结合生产劳动，结合实际，结合思想教育）。一年来，各地教育行政部门，在当地党委的领导下，组织人力改编或编写了教材和参考资料，兴办了寄宿制学校等，这些工作，都取得了很大成绩，解决了部分家长的困难。学生住校以后，学习质量提高了，培养了集体主义观点。同时，由于集体的生活制度，使学生更加团结，身体也更加健康了。
    在过去几年，特别是一九五八年，在党的领导下，教育工作取得了很大的成绩，但是文化教育工作的发展还远远不能满足我国一日千里大跃进的要求。现在需要在这个大发展的基础上进行很多整顿、巩固和提高的工作，在一九五八年巨大胜利的基础上继续争取一九五九年更大的胜利。一九五九年我们学校总的任务是继续深入的研究党的教育方针，努力提高教育质量，根据儿童年龄特征组织他们参加力所能及的多样化的生产劳动，更全面的、合理的安排师生工作、学习、劳动、休息、睡眠的时间，以促进一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    在教学方面，我们提出的任务是：努力提高教学质量，认真系统的总结教学经验，大胆地改革教学方法，要求教师教好、学生学好，使一九五九年的学习成绩比一九五八年提高一步，要求达到大纲中提出的标准。
    在教育方面，我们提出的任务是：继续贯彻小学生守则，加强四个观点的教育，特别是劳动观点与集体主义观点，进一步培养学生劳动习惯，进一步树立学生的集体主义思想。培养学生有礼貌、诚实、谦让等共产主义道德品质。
    为了完成上面的任务，我校全体教师，都在努力提高自己的政治理论水平，继续深入的进行思想改造，在教育战线上兴无灭资，坚决保证党的领导，以使教育工作适应我国生产力发展水平的要求。目前在我们学校里，两种思想，两种方法的斗争，还没有彻底解决。我们必须时刻警惕落后保守思想的抬头，大力克服资产阶级教育思想和个人主义思想，认真学习党在教育工作中的方针政策，坚决贯彻党的教育方针和党的八届六中全会决议的精神，有计划地深入教育革命。在加强思想改造的同时，教师们也都在努力提高自己的业务水平，抓紧业余时间，结合工作进修教育学、心理学，把学习与实际工作联系起来。在工作中，紧密的依靠党，发挥敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，争取在社会主义事业中成为一个又红又专的教育工作者。
    一九五九年的任务是伟大而艰巨的，一九五八年的事实证明，用“两条腿走路”的方针已在教育工作方面取得了很大成就，今后我们仍然要继续贯彻这一方针，正像总理指出的：
  “我国的教育事业的发展，必须采取普及和提高相结合的办法。为了实现文化的普及，为了能够适应当前国家建设事业发展的迫切需要，除了各级全日制正规学校以外，还应当根据实际可能，继续发展半日制学校、农村和厂矿的业余学校。群众性的扫盲工作应当积极推行。同时，我们必须特别注意提高各类学校的教学质量。”我国全体教师，各地教育行政部门和教育工作者们，必须努力为完成这一光荣任务而奋斗。让我们继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，用自己的工作，促进我国文化教育事业的大跃进，迎接我国已经开始了的社会主义文化高潮，迎接我们伟大祖国十周年的国庆。
    任何反动势力想在西藏搞阴谋都要彻底失败
    最近西藏上层反动分子所发动的反对祖国的叛乱，使我们全国的教师与学生感到万分的愤慨。西藏是祖国不可分割的一部分，藏族同胞也是祖国各民族大家庭里的一个成员。现在反动分子叫嚷什么西藏是独立的国家，这完全是乱说八道，这纯粹是帝国主义的老一套，我们早就认识帝国主义这一套了。
    西藏上层反动分子发动的叛乱，完全是可耻的背叛祖国的行为，是我们各民族的敌人，我们全国教师和小学生，坚决拥护政府解散原西藏地方政府，坚决拥护解放军平息叛乱。西藏上层反动分子也好、蒋介石分子也好、帝国主义分子也好，任何反动势力想在西藏打主意搞阴谋都是要彻底失败的。
    现在，西藏人民开始了新生，这是一件很大的好事情，西藏人民会在党的领导下，在全国各族人民的帮助下，建设美丽的新西藏，建设美好的幸福生活。
