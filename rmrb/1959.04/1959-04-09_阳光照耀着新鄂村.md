Sunshine Shines on Xin'e Village

Xin'e Village, Xunke County, Heilongjiang Province, is located on the northern slope of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, on the banks of the Zhan River. Surrounded by mountains, it is a natural grassland basin of hundreds of miles.

Eight years ago, this rich grassland was only home to three or five groups of hunters chasing after animals. Today, it has become a new settlement in northern China. Rows of neat houses stand on both sides of wide streets. Every family has a wooden fenced courtyard, and every household has bright glass windows and clean ceilings and floors.

In November of last year, the people of Xin'e Village established the Xin'e People's Commune, and established four production teams for agriculture, hunting, deer farming, and sideline occupations. The entire commune has sixty-seven households with more than two hundred and fifty people, of which the Oroqen people account for more than 80%. In the past, the Oroqen people lived by hunting for generations, and their lives were very unstable. After liberation, under the glorious light of the Party's ethnic policies, the Oroqen people established new villages from 1953, began to settle down, and lived a stable and happy life like the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland.

The Party and the government have given strong support to the production and construction of the Oroqen people, allocating seeds and new agricultural tools, issuing agricultural loans, and also sending agricultural technicians to provide specific assistance. Therefore, the single hunting production situation has been changed, and diversified operations have been developed. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Oroqen people exerted their soaring energy and achieved a great agricultural harvest. Calculated on a per capita basis, each person had 1,170 jin of grain, which not only achieved self-sufficiency, but also had surplus grain. Income from hunting and sideline production has also continued to increase. With the development of production and the establishment of people's communes, they have also established more than ten factories such as grain processing plants, leather processing plants, clothing factories, and simple woodworking factories, as well as many collective undertakings such as maternity hospitals, hygiene clinics, nurseries, homes for the elderly, schools, supply and marketing cooperatives, and canteens.

Spring light fills the mountain village, bathing the people of the new village in warmth. The brave, hardworking, generous, and optimistic Oroqen people are taking advantage of the good season for hunting and farming to start a new battle.

　　This old hunter, Mo Fuhai, has more than 50 years of hunting experience. After the establishment of the People's Commune, he should have gone to a home for the elderly to spend his old age. But he doesn't accept getting old. He said, "With the People's Commune, the elderly have something to rely on. Now that I can work, I want to work for a few more years." The commune assigned him and several elderly people to form a hunting team to hunt nearby, responsible for supplying meat for the commune canteen.

　　Early spring has arrived in the Khingan Mountains. The Oroqen people of the Xin'e People's Commune are seizing this beautiful time to carry out hunting production.

　　The state has sent new agricultural tools and agricultural technicians to the Xin'e People's Commune. This is agricultural technician Wang Qingwei (right) guiding Oroqen man Meng Debao to repair agricultural tools in preparation for spring plowing.

　　The parturient Mo Xiuzhen is giving birth in the warm and bright branch maternity hospital. The commune sent rice, white flour, and non-staple foods, and she can also recuperate in accordance with the regulations of the maternity hospital until she is a full month old before being discharged.

　　This year, the Xin'e People's Commune plans to hunt a large number of wild animals and produce thousands of furs. In March, this commune had already overfulfilled its hunting production plan. This is women in a leather processing factory sorting out animal skins.

    阳光照耀着新鄂村
    黑龙江省逊克县新鄂村位于小兴安岭北坡的沾河畔，四周群山环抱，是块方圆数百里天然草原盆地。
    八年前，这一片富饶的草原上，只有三、五成伙的猎民追捕兽踪。如今这里已成为祖国北方的一个新的居民点，一排排整齐的房屋屹立在宽广的街道两旁。家家有木制栅栏院套，户户有亮堂堂的玻璃窗和整洁的天棚地板。
    去年11月新鄂村人民成立了新鄂人民公社，建立了农业、猎业、鹿业和副业四个生产队。全社有六十七户二百五十多人，其中鄂伦春人占80％以上。鄂伦春人过去世世代代以狩猎为生，生活很不稳定。解放后在党的民族政策光辉照耀下，鄂伦春民族从1953年建立了新村，开始定居，和祖国各民族人民一样，过着稳定而幸福的生活。
    党和政府对鄂伦春族的生产建设给予了大力支持，调拨了种籽、新式农具，发放农业贷款，并且还派来了农业技术人员进行具体帮助，因而，改变了单一的猎业生产面貌，发展了多种经营，1958年大跃进中，鄂伦春人发挥了冲天干劲，获得农业大丰收。按人口平均计算每人有粮一千一百七十斤，不仅达到了自给自足，而且还有余粮。猎业和副业等生产收入也不断增加。随着生产的发展和人民公社的建立，他们还办起了粮谷加工厂、皮革加工厂、被服厂、简易木工厂等十多个工厂和产院、卫生院、托儿所、敬老院、学校、供销合作社、食堂等许多集体事业。
    春光满山村，暖浴新村人。勇敢、勤劳、豪爽、乐观的鄂伦春人趁着狩猎、农耕的大好季节，又开始了新的战斗。

    这位有五十多年狩猎经验的莫福海老猎手，在人民公社成立后，本应进敬老院度过他的晚年。可是他不服老。他说：“有了人民公社老人就有了依靠，现在能干还要再干几年呢”。公社分配他和几个老人组成一个狩猎小组在附近狩猎，负责供应公社食堂用肉。
    初春到了兴安岭。新鄂人民公社鄂伦春人抓紧这美好的时光，进行狩猎生产。
    国家给新鄂人民公社送来了新式农具，派来了农业技术员。这是农业技术员王庆维（右）在指导鄂伦春人孟德宝检修农具，准备春耕。
    产妇莫秀珍在温暖明洁的分社产院里分娩。公社送来了大米、白面和副食品，她还可以按照产院的规定休养到满月再出院。
    新鄂人民公社供销社第一个鄂伦春女营业员莫桂英。
    新鄂人民公社今年准备猎获大批野生动物和生产上千张毛皮。3月份这个公社已经超额完成了猎业生产计划。这是皮革加工厂妇女在整理兽皮。
