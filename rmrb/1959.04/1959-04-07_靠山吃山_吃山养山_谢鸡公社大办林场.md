Guangzhou, April 6th (This newspaper's dispatch) The Xieji People's Commune in Gaozhou County, Guangdong Province, is vigorously developing forestry farms and engaging in diversified operations, which has powerfully supported agricultural production.

The Xieji Commune has an average of seven mu of barren mountains per person, while only seven fen of cultivated land per person. For a long time, the living standards of the masses could not be rapidly improved because they only relied on the fields and did not manage the mountains. Before communization, the local Party committee repeatedly proposed the slogan of "relying on the mountain to eat from the mountain." After the establishment of the commune, the commune Party committee decided through research to vigorously establish forestry farms, and a secretary of the commune Party committee was assigned to be in charge of this matter. Since then, forestry production in Xieji Commune has developed rapidly. To date, the commune has established 21 large forestry farms, with more than 200 sub-farms and 123 specialized forestry teams, with more than 3,500 fixed professional personnel, managing more than 700,000 mu of young forests planted on the mountains in recent years.

The forestry farms plant miscellaneous grains and cash crops in the forest land, which not only promotes the rapid growth of young forests but also provides rich feed for the development of animal husbandry. The development of animal husbandry has opened up a broad source of fertilizer for agricultural production. The thousands upon thousands of catties of miscellaneous grains harvested and the large amounts of fertilizer accumulated by the forestry farms directly support the commune's agricultural production. The 21 forestry farms in Xieji Commune harvested more than 19 million catties of cassava alone in 1958. In addition to transferring some to support other areas, they also supplied the commune with enough pig feed. After establishing forestry farms, Xieji Commune afforested more than 519,000 mu in 1958. In addition to this, another 230,000 mu were afforested in two successive campaigns this spring. Currently, all barren mountains have been planted with trees, and the natural landscape is about to undergo significant changes.

    靠山吃山　吃山养山
    谢鸡公社大办林场
    本报广州6日电　广东省高州县谢鸡人民公社大办林场，开展多种经营，有力地支援了农业生产。
    谢鸡公社平均每人有荒山七亩，而耕地每人只有七分。长期以来，由于群众只靠田不管山，生活水平总是不能很快提高。在公社化之前，当地党委就一再提出要靠山吃山的口号，建立公社后，经社党委研究确定大力兴办林场，社党委并有一名书记专管此事。从此，谢鸡公社林业生产得到了迅速发展，到目前为止，全社共办起较大的林场二十一个，下设分场二百多处，另有林业专业队一百二十三个，固定专业人员三千五百多名，经营着全社近几年在山上栽植的七十多万亩幼林。
    林场在林地间种杂粮、经济作物，既促进幼林迅速成长，也给畜牧业的发展提供了丰富饲料，畜牧业的发展又给农业增产开辟了广阔的肥源，各林场收获的上千上万斤的杂粮和积下的大批肥料，都直接支援了公社农业生产。谢鸡公社的二十一个林场，在1958年仅间种木茨一项就收获一千九百多万斤，除上调支援外地，还供给公社足够的养猪饲料。谢鸡公社办林场后，除1958年造林五十一万九千多亩外，今春两次突击又造林二十三万亩，目前所有荒山已全部种上树，自然面貌即将发生显著的变化。
