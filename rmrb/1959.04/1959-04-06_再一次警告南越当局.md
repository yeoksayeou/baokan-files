Another Warning to the South Vietnamese Authorities
Commentator of this Newspaper

    Regarding the provocative actions of the Saigon Ngo Dinh Diem clique in infringing upon our country's territorial sovereignty over the Xisha Islands and abducting 82 of our fishermen, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on February 27, lodging a serious protest with the South Vietnamese authorities. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique was forced to release and return all our fishermen as late as March 9. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, disregarding the solemn protests of our government, continues to carry out activities in the area of our Xisha Islands that infringe upon our country's territorial sovereignty. They also abused our abducted fishermen, publicly tore down our national flag on fishing boats and islands, and caused serious losses to the property of these fishermen, without any compensation. For this reason, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again lodged a strong protest and a serious warning with the South Vietnamese authorities on April 5.

    The facts show that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is妄想妄想 attempting to occupy the island territories of our country in the South China Sea by rogue means. Since abducting our fishermen on February 22, the South Vietnamese authorities have increased their military activities in the Xisha Islands. On February 27, the South Vietnamese Navy looted two more of our fishing boats and dispatched naval vessels to the waters near the Yongle Islands, and sent air force planes to conduct reconnaissance over the Yongle Islands. On March 2, the Saigon authorities openly announced the establishment of a so-called "Development Company" to plunder the resources of the Xisha Islands. On March 26, a South Vietnamese gunboat even invaded my Chenhang Island to carry out looting. In order to deceive world public opinion and create a fait accompli of occupying the Xisha Islands, the South Vietnamese News Agency shamelessly sophisted, saying that my Xisha Islands historically and legally belong to South Vietnam. However, it must be reminded to the Ngo Dinh Diem clique that a fabricated history cannot erase the fact that the Xisha Islands, historically and legally, are an integral part of Chinese territory! The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that every island in the Xisha Islands belongs to its master—the Chinese people. This is irrefutable. The Chinese people will never allow anyone to infringe upon our country's sacred sovereignty over the Xisha Islands!

    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's abduction and abuse of our fishermen is another crime committed against the Chinese people. The South Vietnamese authorities repeatedly talk about "humanity" and that "the equipment has been returned to them (Chinese fishermen)," etc. However, the undeniable fact is that the Ngo Dinh Diem elements not only conducted illegal "interrogations" of our fishermen, but sometimes did not give them food or drink, threatened them with guns, forced them to "stand at attention" in front of the flag of the South Vietnamese regime, and exposed them to the scorching sun. What's more, those Ngo Dinh Diem elements took the opportunity to rob money and property, looting all of our fishermen's fishing gear, watches, pens, RMB, and clothing, causing great material losses to the abducted fishermen. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique actually carried out the acts of robbers in broad daylight on the sea off our Xisha Islands, which cannot but arouse great indignation among the Chinese people. The South Vietnamese authorities must bear full responsibility for the despicable acts of their personnel in robbing and abusing our fishermen, must apologize for the insults to our national flag and the abuse of our fishermen, and must compensate for all the losses of our abducted fishermen!

    It should be pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities are so rampant in provoking the Chinese people because they are instigated by American imperialism behind their backs. American warships and planes have coordinated with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in infringing upon our country's Xisha Islands. Since February 22, American patrol planes have been circling over the Xisha Islands all day long. American Pacific Fleet Commander Hopwood has distorted the facts and falsely accused our country's exercise of sovereignty over the Xisha Islands as a "threat." American news agencies have widely publicized that our actions to safeguard sovereignty "may endanger peace," clamoring that it "may ignite a spark of a major war" and that "this situation cannot be ignored." Obviously, American imperialism is instigating the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to provoke the Chinese people; it is part of its ongoing aggressive plan to control and dominate the entire Indochina Peninsula and create tension in the Far East.

    The United States has turned South Vietnam into a military base for its aggression in Indochina, and is now using this base to infringe upon China's territory and sovereignty over the Xisha Islands. If the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is willing to act as a tool of American aggression and does not stop its provocative actions against the Chinese people, then it will inevitably bear all the consequences that may arise.

    再一次警告南越当局
    本报评论员
    对于西贡吴庭艳集团侵犯我国对西沙群岛的领土主权，劫走我渔民八十二人的挑衅行动，我国外交部已于2月27日发表声明，向南越当局提出了严重的抗议。吴庭艳集团迟至3月9日不得不把我全部渔民释放归来。但是，吴庭艳集团仍然不顾我国政府的严正抗议，继续在我国西沙群岛地区进行着侵犯我国领土主权的活动，并且还对我国被劫走的渔民进行了虐待，在渔船上和海岛上公然撕下我国国旗，并使这些渔民的资产遭到严重损失，而毫无赔偿。为此，我国外交部于4月5日再次向南越当局提出了强硬的抗议和严重警告。
    事实表明，吴庭艳集团妄想用无赖的手段侵占我国在南中国海的岛屿领土。自从2月22日劫走我国渔民以后，南越当局对西沙群岛的军事活动有增无已。2月27日，南越海军又曾劫掠了我国的两艘渔船，并且还增派了海军舰只至永乐群岛附近海面，派遣空军飞机到永乐群岛上空进行侦察。3月2日西贡当局竟公开宣布成立一个所谓“开发公司”，以掠夺西沙群岛上的资源。3月26日，南越炮艇竟又侵入我琛航岛进行抢劫。为了蒙骗世界舆论和造成侵占西沙群岛的既成事实，南越通讯社公然恬不知耻地进行诡辩，说我西沙群岛从历史上和法律上都属于南越，但是，必须提醒吴庭艳集团，一张伪造历史的通告，岂能抹煞西沙群岛无论从历史上和法律上说都是中国领土不可分割的一部分的事实！中国政府一再声明，西沙群岛上的任何一个岛屿都属于它的主人——中国人民，这是确定不移的。中国人民绝不能容许任何人侵犯我国对西沙群岛的神圣的主权！
    吴庭艳集团劫走我国渔民，并对他们进行了虐待，这是对中国人民犯下的又一项罪行。南越当局口口声声谈什么“人道”，什么“用具已经归还给他们（中国渔民）”等等，可是，无可抵赖的事实是，吴庭艳分子不仅对我渔民进行了非法的“审讯”，而且有时不给他们吃喝，用枪威胁他们，强迫他们对着南越政权的旗帜“罚站”，在烈日底下曝晒。更有甚者，那些吴庭艳分子竟乘机抢劫钱财，把我渔民的渔具、手表、钢笔、人民币和服装，都劫掠一空，使那些被劫渔民遭受很大的物质上的损失。吴庭艳集团居然在光天化日之下到我国西沙群岛的海面上，干出了抢劫犯的勾当，这不能不引起中国人民极大的愤慨。南越当局必须对它的人员这种抢劫和虐待我国渔民的卑劣行为负完全责任，必须对侮辱我国国旗和虐待我国渔民事件进行道歉，并赔偿我国被劫渔民的一切损失！
    应该指出，南越当局这样猖狂地对中国人民进行挑衅，是由于它的背后有着美国帝国主义的指使。美国军舰和飞机配合了吴庭艳集团对我国西沙群岛的侵犯活动，在2月22日以后，美国的巡逻机曾竟日盘旋在西沙群岛的上空。美国太平洋舰队总司令霍普伍德颠倒黑白，竟反诬我国对西沙群岛行使主权是“威胁”，美国通讯社大肆宣传我国维护主权的行动“可能危及和平”，叫嚷“可能爆发成一场大战的火星”以及不能“忽视这种局势”。很显然，美国帝国主义唆使吴庭艳集团向中国人民进行挑衅；是目前它正在进行的控制和霸占整个印度支那半岛制造远东地区紧张局势的侵略计划的一个组成部分。
    美国已经把南越变成了它侵略印度支那的一个军事基地，现在又利用这个基地来侵犯中国西沙群岛的领土和主权。吴庭艳集团如果甘心充当美国的侵略工具，不停止它对中国人民的挑衅行动，那末它就不可避免地要承担一切可能引起的后果。
