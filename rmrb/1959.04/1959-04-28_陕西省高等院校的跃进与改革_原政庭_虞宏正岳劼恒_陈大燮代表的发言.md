First of all, we fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and express our willingness to strive wholeheartedly for the tasks on the economic and cultural-educational fronts in 1959, as proposed by the Premier. We also fully agree with the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li and Vice Chairman Peng. We would now like to talk to the conference about the leap forward and reform of higher education institutions in Shaanxi Province in 1958.

1958 was a year of great leap forward for the whole country, and Shaanxi Province's higher education institutions were no exception. Let's first talk about the changes in quantity. In 1956, Shaanxi Province had relatively few higher education institutions compared to now. At that time, there were ten institutions in total: Northwest University, Northwest Institute of Technology, Northwest Agricultural College, Xi'an Normal College, Shaanxi Normal College, Xi'an Medical College, Xi'an Art College, Xi'an Institute of Physical Education, Northwest Russian Language College, and the Fourth Military Medical University. By the autumn of 1958, in addition to the above-mentioned institutions, Northwest University of Technology (formed by merging part of the original Northwest Institute of Technology with a aviation school relocated from Nanjing), Jiaotong University, Xi'an Second Medical College, Xi'an Metallurgical College (formerly Xi'an Institute of Architecture), Xi'an Mining Institute (formerly the Mining Department of Jiaotong University), Northwest Academy of Fine Arts and Northwest Conservatory of Music (both reformed from Northwest Art College), Xi'an Chemical Engineering College, Xi'an Teachers College, Xi'an Highway College, and Xi'an Machine Building College were added. It is also possible that three new colleges will be established this year. Thus, Xi'an and its vicinity will have more than twenty higher education institutions, becoming a new cultural center.

The number of students enrolled in higher education institutions in our province before 1956 was 22,322, and in 1958 it was 35,059. The number of new students enrolled was 3,791 in 1955 and 11,169 in 1958. Whether from the number of schools or the number of students, the leap forward in quantity of higher education institutions in our province is significant.

The leap forward and reform in quality also have very significant achievements. We will talk about four issues in this regard, namely: 1. The improvement of teachers' and students' ideological understanding in the great education reform; 2. Vigorously engaging in scientific research; 3. New teacher-student relationships; 4. How to further implement the integration of teaching and productive labor.

Teachers' and students' ideological understanding have improved

I. The improvement of teachers' and students' ideological understanding. Here, we must first talk about the issue of Party leadership. Before the education revolution, most teachers had a vague understanding of the Party's leadership. They believed that the Party's leadership in schools was mainly in political and ideological aspects, and they doubted whether the Party could lead teaching and business, let alone lead scientific research. The understanding of the Party's leadership was abstract, not absolute, and not concrete. They had considerable respect for the school Party committee, but they often relied on their seniority and disregarded the grassroots Party branches, especially the older teachers. After the ideological criticism and heart-to-heart movement in 1958, teachers had a preliminary understanding of the Party's leadership and understood that they should not only listen to the words of the higher Party organizations, but also listen to the words of the Party's grassroots organizations. However, this understanding was still relatively abstract. Then, through academic thought criticism, teachers began to realize their "three detachments" and that they were only half-intellectuals. They understood that without relying on the Party and the masses to transform themselves, it would be difficult to undertake the task of cultivating talents for the country. Since the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on education work were issued, most teachers, in the initial stage, still had some doubts about the absolute leadership of the Party in schools, the mass line of education, and the three-way combination. They questioned whether the Party could lead scientific research, whether productive labor would reduce the quality of teaching, and how much initiative students could play in teaching. However, the Party's strong leadership and the brilliant achievements it has obtained in the education revolution have educated everyone, causing everyone to change from doubt to firm support for the Party's education policy, and to actively participate in its implementation, thereby achieving very good results. Examples of this are countless. For example, the Biology Department of Shaanxi Normal College, in conjunction with the wildlife plant survey organized by the Provincial Planning Commission, identified more than 750 species of wild plants, collected more than 10,500 specimens, and compiled more than 300,000 words of "Technical Data on the Utilization of Wild Plants in Shaanxi Province," thereby enriching the teaching content and providing valuable reference materials for local industry. For example, more than a thousand teachers and students from the geology, geography, and other departments of Northwest University went to the mountains to survey and investigate the Daba Mountains and Qinling Mountains, discovering many mineral deposits and proposing a comprehensive utilization plan for the Xunhe River water conservancy, and also conducted a more comprehensive survey of the flora and fauna of this region, thereby greatly enriching the teaching materials and contributing to industrial and agricultural construction. For example, after teachers and students of Northwest Agricultural College went to the countryside to eat, live, and work with farmers, they put down their airs and corrected their erroneous views of belittling labor and theory being divorced from reality. In compiling teaching materials, they also initially combined the specific realities of China's agricultural production great leap forward and corrected the past practice of simply copying from books. In 1959, they launched a thousand people to the countryside to participate in the wheat rust prevention team, contributing to the further leap forward of agricultural production. For example, the teachers and students of the Xi'an section of Jiaotong University, through vigorously engaging in production, built steelmaking, aluminum smelting, enameled wire, electromagnetic, and power machinery factories on campus; designed several factories for Xi'an and Yan'an prefectures outside the campus; established more than 100 small blast furnaces for Shangluo Prefecture; trained 5,000 technical workers; and made many designs and participated in the construction for Shaanxi's water conservancy construction. In this way, not only has the school taken a big step forward in linking theory with practice, but it has also played a certain role in the industrial and agricultural construction of Shaanxi Province; at the same time, it has improved relations with the working people in the Northwest, erasing the Northwest working masses' view of Jiaotong University's teachers and students being pampered and spoiled. The above examples are just a few, and each school can give many similar examples. From these vivid facts, the vast number of teachers realized that teaching and scientific research must be led by the Party, that productive labor can greatly improve the quality of teaching, that theory must be closely integrated with practice, and that the mass line is a teaching method that achieves more, faster, better, and more economically. They reversed the erroneous views of education being divorced from production, theory being divorced from reality, and belittling labor for more than two thousand years, and preliminarily realized that education cannot be separated from politics, that the education revolution is a revolutionary work of the struggle between the two roads of promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism, and that education must serve the proletariat. They also preliminarily established an atmosphere of loving labor and respecting working people. We believe that this is the glorious victory of higher education institutions in Shaanxi Province in 1958, a great improvement in the quality of teaching, and it has laid a good foundation for further implementing the Party's education policy in the future.

Launched a mass scientific research campaign

II. Vigorously engaging in scientific research. The scientific and technological research strength of higher education institutions in our province was not too weak after 1957, but before 1958, scientific research work was still very bleak, especially collective and mass scientific research work, which was even rarer. At that time, most of the older and more mature teachers were lazy to work, young teachers mystified scientific research and dared not intervene, and students dared not even think about scientific research. In the autumn of 1958, due to the Party's call to break superstitions, liberate thoughts, and the masses vigorously engaging in scientific research became a trend. The participation surface of scientific research work expanded from a few teachers to all teachers and to students. For example, the extraction of rare elements and the synthesis of high-grade plastics in the Chemistry Department of Northwest University, the research on semiconductors and photoresistors in the Physics Department, and the mathematical research related to production in the Mathematics Department improved the quality of teaching through scientific research and solved the problem of scientific research being linked to production. For example, the research on agricultural tool reform and disease prevention at Northwest Agricultural College; the production of pesticides, reactive dyes, and other chemical products, and the extraction of rare elements at Shaanxi Normal College are all helpful for linking theory with practice and improving the quality of teaching. The Education Teaching and Research Group of Shaanxi Normal College, under the leadership of the Party committee, organized teachers and students to go deep into the countryside, factories, and primary and secondary schools to conduct investigations and research, held 141 forums, and collectively compiled a "Special Lecture Notes on Education" with a strong ideological content that combined China's actual situation. For example, the teachers and students of the Xi'an section of Jiaotong University worked together to complete 22 cutting-edge major scientific research projects as a gift for New Year's Day in 1959, including electromechanical equipment related to the Three Gorges, atomic energy, semiconductors, mathematical integrator, AC calculator, alloy steel system, and free piston gas turbine. This year, more than 60 cutting-edge major scientific research projects are underway as gifts for the National Day. Due to the strong leadership of the Party committees of various schools, the scientific research work of various schools has shifted from a bleak situation where a few people engaged in scientific research to a hot and lively situation where the masses vigorously engaged in scientific research. It broke superstitions, liberated thoughts, enabled young teachers and students to start working, and also promoted the enthusiasm of older teachers, thereby improving the quality of teaching on the one hand, and also embarking on the journey to surpass Britain in academics on the other hand. This is another great victory for higher education institutions in Shaanxi Province in 1958.

Established new teacher-student relationships

III. New teacher-student relationships. New teacher-student relationships have also been established from the education revolution. In the past, teacher-student relationships were unequal. Students might not admire some teachers in their hearts, but due to tradition, they were somewhat superstitious and did not easily offer opinions; young teachers were the same to older teachers. Teachers to students or older teachers to younger teachers inevitably put on a little false airs. Because theory was seriously divorced from reality, they sometimes pretended to understand when they didn't, misleading themselves and others. After academic criticism and the education revolution, false airs were put down, and criticism and self-criticism were initially launched, creating conditions for seeking truth from facts and learning from each other, thereby greatly improving the quality of teaching. For example, in terms of compiling teaching materials, under the leadership of the Party, the teaching materials compiled by teachers and students working together or collectively were indeed much better than those done by individuals alone. The "Special Lecture Notes on Education" of Shaanxi Normal College mentioned above is one example. Such teaching materials could not be written by individuals without collective cooperation. For example, the Water Conservancy Department of Jiaotong University, through the cooperation of teachers and students, including agricultural and water conservancy technicians transferred from all over the country for short-term training, compiled teaching materials on water conservancy management, which are of great value for teaching and water conservancy construction. For example, Northwest Agricultural College is now using the collective compilation of teaching materials through teacher-student cooperation as the school's current key work. Of course, the benefits of teacher-student cooperation are not only reflected in the compilation of teaching materials. In some schools, learning leadership groups for each course have been established in the education revolution, thereby embodying the Party's leadership, the active role of the masses, and the leading role of teachers in the regular and specific teaching work, and improving the quality of teaching. Due to the Party's leadership, the enthusiasm of teachers has been promoted. For example, teachers have generally strengthened preparation and tutoring, and older teachers have also gone to the laboratory to participate in the preparation and guidance of experiments.

Regarding the issue of the leading role of teachers in teaching, we believe that this does not contradict the equal and democratic relationship between teachers and students. For teachers to play a leading role in teaching, they must: 1. Be under the leadership and support of the Party; 2. Be under the conditions of respecting teachers and loving students, learning from each other, and full equal cooperation between teachers and students; 3. Be under the condition that their political level is constantly improving. Only in this way can their leading role be solid and improve the quality of teaching. Regarding the question of whether teachers should be fully responsible for students, we believe that they should, so we must speed up the transformation. However, we cannot wait until the comprehensive transformation is completed before fully taking responsibility or playing a leading role. Therefore, service must be closely coordinated with transformation. More transformation means more service; and transformation must be combined with service. More service also means more practical transformation.

How to further implement the policy of combining teaching with productive labor

IV. How to further implement the policy of combining teaching with productive labor. We believe that the task of combining with productive labor has two aspects. On the one hand, productive labor can improve the political awareness of teachers and students; on the other hand, if productive labor can be combined with the major, it can closely link theory with practice, thereby helping to improve the quality of teaching. For students majoring in engineering and agriculture, it is relatively easy to combine labor with their major as much as possible. For students majoring in science and medicine, it can also be combined. For example, the Physics Department of Northwest University established a machine factory, and students who work in the factory can reach the level of a third-grade technician upon graduation; for example, the Mathematics Department of Shaanxi Normal College produced several kinds of calculation and surveying tools through factory labor; for example, the Xi'an Medical College established a bacterial fertilizer factory, all of which helped to improve the quality of teaching. We believe that even in liberal arts and social sciences, students participating in labor not only helps to cultivate character, but also enriches students' social practice and general knowledge, even though it may not be direct, thereby also helping to improve the quality of teaching.

Why did various schools in our province achieve such brilliant results in 1958? We believe that the first is due to the Party's correct education policy, the second is the strong leadership of the Party committees of various colleges and universities, and the third is the gradual improvement of the political awareness of the masses through successive political movements. We believe that to further implement the Party's education policy in the future, the ideological transformation of the vast number of teachers and students - further promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism - is still a very important link.

The four of us serve at Shaanxi Normal College, Northwest University, Northwest Agricultural College, and Jiaotong University, so the examples cited are biased towards the above four schools, not to say that other schools do not have better examples. The four of us do not have a deep understanding of the Party's education policy, and there may be erroneous arguments. Please criticize and correct them. The four colleges and universities where we work also had some shortcomings in the great education revolution in 1958. But due to the Party's strong leadership, the achievements are the main thing, and the shortcomings are secondary and individual.

Finally, we would like to say a few words about the Tibet issue. Putting down the rebellion in Tibet is entirely our internal affair, and no foreigner has the right to interfere. Some Indian politicians also talk about adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but in reality, first, they have condoned our rebellious elements to continue using Kalimpong as the center of rebellious activities for a long time; second, their government officials have distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" under obviously false pretenses. The rhetoric in this statement is absurd and full of loopholes, even failing to mention the Dalai Lama's three personal letters, and even saying that Tibetans are not Chinese. Is this adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in action? As for the expansionist elements in India, they are even openly clamoring to interfere in our internal affairs, to inherit the traditional policy of British imperialism, nominally demanding "Tibetan independence," but in reality, they want to expand India's influence into Tibet, which is helping the imperialists and fully undermining Sino-Indian friendship. According to their argument, we cannot help but ask: Are the people of some native states and ethnic minorities in India not Indians? Should they all be independent from India?

The rebellion of a few reactionary elements in Tibet has been basically put down, and the urgent demands of the vast majority of people in Tibet, more than 98% of the people, for democratic reform and social reform will be realized. The Tibetan people have the responsibility and right to change the dark and backward face of the Tibetan region. Whether the ambitious people sympathize with it or not will not affect the social and democratic reform in Tibet in the slightest. We cherish the long-term friendship between China and India very much, but we also have the right to ask our Indian friends to cherish this friendship equally.

We want to advise the great political leaders of our great neighbor, India, to be calm, that it is extremely unrealistic, extremely unwise, and also very dangerous for a newly independent nation to inherit the expansionist policy of the imperialists and take the old road of the imperialists. We advise you to be careful not to fall into the trap of the imperialists, be used by the imperialists, and walk into a dead end that you cannot escape from."

The above are our four immature opinions, please representatives correct them.

Wish the conference a successful conclusion and the representatives good health.

    陕西省高等院校的跃进与改革
    原政庭　虞宏正岳劼恒　陈大燮代表的发言
    首先我们完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，并表示愿意全力为总理所提出的一九五九年的经济战线与文化教育战线上的任务奋斗。我们也完全同意两位李副总理和彭副委员长的报告。我们现在要在大会上谈一谈一九五八年陕西省高等院校跃进与改革的情况。
    一九五八年是全国大跃进的一年，陕西省高等院校也不例外。首先来谈谈数量上的改变。一九五六年时陕西省的高等院校，比之现在来讲，是不太多的。那时有西北大学、西北工院、西北农院、西安师院、陕西师院、西安医学院、西安艺专、西安体院、西北俄专及第四军医大学共十个院校。到一九五八年秋后，除上述院校外，又增加了西北工业大学（原西北工院的一部分与南京迁来的航校合并而成）、交通大学、西安第二医学院、西安冶金学院（西安建院改）、西安矿业学院（交通大学采矿系改）、西北美专及西北音专（两校由西北艺专改）、西安化工学院、西安师专、西安公路学院、西安机器制造学院，还可能要在今年度再成立三个新的学院。如是西安及其附近将拥有二十余所高等院校，已成为一个新的文化重心。
    我省高等学校在校学生一九五六年以前为二万二千三百二十二人，一九五八年为三万五千零五十九人。招收新生数一九五五年为三千七百九十一人，一九五八年为一万一千一百六十九人。不论从学校数目或学生人数来看，我省高校在数量上的跃进是巨大的。
    质量上的跃进与改革也有其十分显著的成绩。这方面我们将谈四个问题，即：1、在教育大改革中师生在思想认识上的提高；2、大搞科学研究；3、新的师生关系；4、如何进一步贯彻教学与生产劳动相结合。
    师生思想认识都有了提高
    一、师生思想认识上的提高。这里首先要谈到党的领导问题。教育革命以前，大多数教师对党的领导是模糊的。认为党在学校里主要是政治思想上的领导，对党能否领导教学业务还有怀疑，至于能否领导科学研究，更难置信。对党的领导的认识是抽象的，不是绝对的，不是具体的。对于校党委还有相当的尊重，但对基层党支，尤其是年老教师，往往依老卖老，等闲视之。经过一九五八年的思想批判与交心运动，教师们对于党的领导有了初步认识，也明白了不但应该听上级党组织的话，也应该听党的基层组织的话，但认识也还是比较抽象的。接着经过学术思想批判，教师们初步认识了自己的“三脱”，只是一个半知识分子，明白了非依靠党、依靠群众来改造自己，难以负担为国家培养人才的任务。自从中共中央和国务院关于教育工作的指示下达以后，大多数的教师在开始阶段，对于党在学校中的绝对领导，教育的群众路线及三结合，还多少有些怀疑，如党能否领导科学研究，劳动生产会不会降低教学质量，学生能对教学起多大的主动作用等等。但党的坚强领导，及其在教育革命中所获得的辉煌成绩，教育了大家，使大家对党的教育方针，从将信将疑转变到坚决拥护，并且积极投身进去，贯彻执行，从而取得了很好的结果。这方面的例子，是不胜枚举的。如陕西师范学院生物系结合省计委所组织的野生植物调查，认识了七百五十多种野生植物，搜集了一万零五百多份标本，编写了三十余万字的“陕西省野生植物利用技术资料”，从而丰富了教学内容，也对地方工业提供了有价值的参考资料。又如西北大学的地质、地理等系，师生千余人上山，对大巴山及秦岭地区作了勘查与调查，发现了许多矿藏，提出了一个综合利用洵河水利的规划，也对这一地区的动植物作了较全面的调查，从而大大地丰富了教材内容，也对工农业建设作出了贡献。又如西北农学院经过师生下乡与农民同吃同住同劳动，放下了架子，纠正了轻视劳动和理论脱离实际的错误观点，在编写教材上，也初步结合了我国农业生产大跃进的具体实际，改正了已往书本搬家的作风。于一九五九年又发动千人下乡，参加了小麦防锈大队，为农业生产的再跃进，贡献了力量。又如交通大学西安部分的师生经过大搞生产，在校内筹建了炼钢、炼铝、漆包线、电磁、动力机械等厂；在校外为西安及延安专区设计了若干工厂，为商雒专区建立了一百余个小高炉，培训了五千个技术工人，为陕西水利建设作了不少的设计并参加施工。这样，不但该校在理论联系实际上往前大大迈进了一步；也对陕西省的工农业建设，起了一定的作用；同时也改善了与西北劳动人民间的关系，抹去了西北劳动大众对交大师生娇生惯养的看法。以上所举的例子，只是少数的几个，每个学校都可以举出类似的不少的例子。从这些活生生的事实，使广大教师认识到教学与科学研究必须由党领导，生产劳动可以大大提高教学质量，理论必须密切结合实际，群众路线是多快好省的教学方法，扭转了二千余年教育脱离生产，理论脱离实际和轻视劳动的错误观点，初步认识到教育不能脱离政治，教育革命是一个兴无灭资两条道路斗争的革命工作，和教育必须为无产阶级服务，也初步树立了热爱劳动和尊重劳动人民的风气。我们认为这是陕西省高等院校一九五八年的辉煌胜利，是教学质量的大提高，也为今后更深入贯彻党的教育方针，打下了良好的基础。
    开展了群众性的科学研究
    二、大搞科学研究。我省高等院校的科技研究力量，一九五七年以后已是不太薄弱的了，但是在一九五八年以前，科学研究工作仍是十分冷冷清清，尤其是集体的和群众性的科学研究工作，更是寥若晨星。其时，大多数年老而比较成熟的教师，懒于动手；青年教师把科学研究神秘化了，不敢插手；学生对科学研究更不敢设想。一九五八年秋由于党的号召，破除迷信，解放思想，群众大搞科学研究成为风气。科学研究工作的参加面，由少数教师扩大到教师全体，扩大到学生。如西北大学化学系的稀有元素的提炼，高级塑料的合成，物理系半导体及光敏电阻的研究，数学系的联系生产的数学研究等，经过科学研究提高了教学质量，又解决了科学研究联系生产的问题。又如西北农院的农具改革及病害防止的研究；陕西师院化学系的农药、活性染料、及其他化学品的生产，稀有元素的提炼等，都有助于理论联系实际，也提高了教学质量。陕西师院教育学教研组又在党委领导下组织师生深入农村，工厂，中小学，调查研究，举行了一百四十一次座谈会，集体编写了一本结合我国实际，思想性较强的“教育学专题讲稿”。又如交通大学西安部分师生共同努力，完成了一九五九年元旦献礼的尖端重大科学研究项目共二十二项，其中有有关三峡的机电设备、原子能、半导体、数学积分机、交流计算台、合金钢系统、自由活塞燃气轮机等，今年又在进行六十余项国庆献礼的尖端重大科学研究项目。由于各校党委的坚强领导，使各校的科学研究工作，从冷冷清清少数人搞科学研究，转变到热火朝天群众大搞科学研究。打破了迷信，解放了思想，使青年教师与学生大家动手，也促进了老年教师的积极性，从而一方面提高了教学质量，另方面也为在学术上超过英国，跨上了征鞍。这又是我省高等院校一九五八年的一个伟大胜利。
    建立了新的师生关系
    三、新的师生关系。从教育革命中也建立了新的师生关系。以往的师生关系是不平等的。学生对于某些老师，可能心里不佩服，但忸于传统，多少有些迷信，不轻提意见；年青教师对年老教师亦然如此。教师对学生或年老教师对年青教师，则不免要摆一点虚架子。由于理论严重脱离实际，有时还要不懂装懂，误人误己。经过学术批判和教育革命，虚架子放下了，批评与自我批评初步展开了，造成了实事求是，教学相长的条件，从而大大的提高了教学的质量。如以编写教材而论，在党的领导下，师生合作或集体所编出的教材，确乎要比单干的好得多。上面所举陕西师院“教育学专题讲稿”就是一个例子。这样的教材，非集体合作，个人是写不出来的。又如交通大学水利系经过师生合作，其中有全国各地调来短期受训的农田及水利技术人员，编出关于水利管理方面的教材，于教学，于水利建设都有极大的价值。又如西北农院更以师生合作集体编写教材作为该校目前的重点工作。当然，师生合作的好处，不仅表现在编写教材方面，若干学校在教育革命中，建立了各课程的学习领导小组，从而在经常的具体的教学工作中，体现了党的领导，群众的积极作用，也发挥了教师的主导作用，提高了教学的质量。由于党的领导，促进了教师的积极性，如教师一般都加强了备课与辅导，老年教师也都下实验室，参加了筹备实验与指导实验的工作。
    关于教师在教学上的主导作用问题，我们认为这是与师生间的平等民主关系并不矛盾的。教师在教学上起主导作用，必须：1、在党的领导和支持下；2、在尊师爱生，教学相长，师生充分平等合作下；3、在自己的政治水平不断提高下，才有可能。唯有如此，其主导作用才是踏实的，可以提高教学质量的。关于教师是否要对同学全面负责的问题，我们认为是应该的，所以我们必须加紧改造。但又不能等待，等全面改造以后再来全面负责或起其主导作用，所以服务又必须与改造密切配合，服务不忘改造，多一分改造，便多一分服务；而改造又要结合服务，多一分服务也多一分改造的实践。
    如何进一步贯彻教学与生产劳动相结合的方针
    四、如何进一步贯彻教学与生产劳动相结合的方针。我们认为，结合生产劳动的任务，是两方面的。一方面通过生产劳动可以提高师生的政治觉悟；另方面如生产劳动有可能结合专业的话，又可以使理论密切联系实际，从而有助于提高教学的质量。对于工科及农科的学生来讲，劳动尽可能结合专业，是比较容易办到的。对于理科和医科来讲，也可以结合。如西北大学物理系办了机工厂，同学下厂劳动毕业时可以达到三级技工的水平；如陕西师院数学系通过了工厂劳动，制出了若干种计算及测绘工具；如西安医学院办了细菌肥料厂，都有助于教学质量的提高。我们认为，即使在文科与社会科学方面，学生参加劳动，不但有助于品质的培养，尽管可能不是直接的，也丰富了学生的社会实践，丰富了一般知识，从而也有助于教学质量的提高。
    我省各校在一九五八年为何能取得这样的辉煌战果呢，我们认为首先是由于党的正确的教育方针，其次是各院校党委的坚强领导，再次是群众经过历次政治运动的政治觉悟的逐步提高。我们认为今后更深入的贯彻党的教育方针，对广大师生的思想改造——进一步的兴无灭资，仍是一个十分重要的环节。
    我们四人是在陕西师院、西北大学、西北农院、交通大学服务的，所以所举例子偏重于以上四个学校，并不是说其他学校没有更好的例子了。我们四人对党的教育方针体会不深，可能有错误的论点。请予批评指正。我们参加工作的四个院校，在一九五八年教育大革命中，也有些缺点。但由于党的坚强领导，成绩是主要的，缺点则是次要而个别的。
    最后，我们还要就西藏问题讲几句话。平定西藏叛乱，完全是我国内政，任何外国人没有权来干涉。有某些印度的政治家，口上也讲遵守五项原则，但实际上，第一，纵容我国的叛乱分子长期而继续以噶伦堡作为叛乱活动的中心；第二，由他们的政府官员散发显系假借名义的所谓“达赖喇嘛声明”。这个声明中言论荒谬，漏洞百出，甚至无法提到达赖喇嘛的三封亲笔信，还说什么西藏人不是中国人。这难道是在行为上遵守五项原则吗？至于印度的扩张主义分子，更公然叫嚣，要干涉我国内政，要继承英帝国主义的传统政策名义上要求“西藏独立”，实际上要把印度的势力扩张到西藏去，那更是为帝国主义者张目，在全力破坏中印的友谊了。根据他们的论点，我们不禁要问：印度某些土邦的人民和少数民族是不是印度人？是不是都应该从印度独立出去？
    西藏少数反动分子的叛乱，已基本上平定，西藏极大多数人民，百分之九十八以上的人民，他们的迫切的民主改革和社会改革的要求，将要实现。西藏人民有责任和权利来改变西藏地区的黑暗落后面貌。野心家们的同情也罢，不同情也罢，是丝毫不能影响西藏的社会与民主改革的。我们十分珍视中印之间的长期友谊，但也有权利要求印度的朋友们同样珍视这个友谊呵。
    我们要奉劝我们的伟大邻邦——印度——的伟大政治领袖们，头脑冷静一点，一个新的民族独立国家，要继承帝国主义者的扩张政策，走帝国主义者的老路，是极不现实，极不明智，也是十分危险的。劝你们小心一些，不要钻进帝国主义者的圈套，为帝国主义者所利用，自己走到死胡同里去而无法脱身的。”
    以上是我们四人不成熟的意见，请代表们指正。
    祝大会胜利成功，代表们身体健康。
