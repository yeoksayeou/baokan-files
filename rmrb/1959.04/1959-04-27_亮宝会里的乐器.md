Musical Instruments at the Treasure Exhibition
　　Mao Jizeng
　　When Princess Wencheng went to Tibet, she also brought a band with her. The musical instruments left behind by this band have been treasured by the Tibetan people and kept in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa. Due to the dry climate in Tibet, the musical instruments have not been damaged much to this day. These instruments are usually locked in a large warehouse sealed with lacquer stamps. Only during the Treasure Exhibition on the thirtieth day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar each year are these instruments and other cultural relics preserved in the temple taken out. People can see them during the parade and exhibition in Lhasa. The instruments are brightly colored and exquisitely made, totaling more than fifty pieces (it is said that this is only a part of them, mixed with Tibetan musical instruments). The vast majority are plucked string instruments, some resembling the Xinjiang instrument "Harlong," and some resembling the Bulgarian folk instrument "Gadulka" ...
　　There are not many Tang Dynasty musical instruments preserved in our country today. This batch of instruments is a valuable asset that cannot be ignored in the history of Chinese music. Its sorting and research should be a glorious task for Tibetan and Han music workers in the future.

    亮宝会里的乐器
    毛继增
    文成公主入藏时，还带去了一个乐队，这个乐队所遗留下来的乐器，一直被西藏人民珍贵地保存在拉萨大昭寺里。由于西藏气候干燥，乐器至今没有多大损坏。这些乐器平时都锁在盖有漆印的大仓库里，只有在每年藏历二月三十日的亮宝会上，这批乐器才和保存在这座寺庙里的其他文物一齐搬出来。在拉萨城里游行亮宝的时候，人们便能观光到。乐器色泽鲜艳，制作精美，共有五十多件，（据说这只是其中的一部分，内杂有藏族乐器），绝大多数都是弹拨乐器，有的像新疆乐器“哈龙”，有的像保加利亚民族乐器“札杜尔卡”……
    现在我国保存的唐代乐器，已经不多，这批乐器在我国音乐史上是一笔不可忽视的宝贵财富，对它的整理和研究，应该是今后藏汉音乐工作者的一项光荣任务。
