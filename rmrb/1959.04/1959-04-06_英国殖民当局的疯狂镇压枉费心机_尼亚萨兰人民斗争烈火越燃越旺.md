The large-scale anti-colonial rule struggle of the people of Nyasaland, which began in late January, has persisted for more than seventy days. During these seventy-plus days, the British colonial authorities have transferred large numbers of military police from Tanganyika, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and South Africa to carry out frantic suppression. On March 1 alone, as many as seventy troop transport planes flew from Southern Rhodesia to Blantyre. On March 3, the British colonial authorities further declared a "state of emergency" in Nyasaland, wantonly arresting and killing Nyasaland national independence fighters. To date, more than one hundred Africans have been killed by colonial military police, and nearly one thousand Africans have been arrested, including Nyasaland African National Congress President Banda, Legislative Council member Chipembere, and other leaders of the national independence movement.

Despite the British colonial authorities' strict news blockade, it can be seen from between the lines of Western news agencies and African newspapers that the colonial authorities' frantic suppression has failed to achieve its intended purpose. Southern Rhodesia's "Citizen" said: Although the leaders of the Nyasaland African National Congress have been arrested, "the seeds have been sown," and a new spirit of resolute struggle "is on the rise" among the people of Nyasaland. A reporter for South Africa's "Golden City Post" also specifically reported on the situation of Nyasaland nationalists going underground to prepare for guerrilla warfare. The British "Manchester Guardian" also acknowledged that the colonial military police's frantic suppression activities have caused the anger of the vast majority of the people of Nyasaland to "reach the boiling point."

The struggle of the people of Nyasaland against colonial rule has caused great shock in Britain. The American "National Guardian" reported that the impact of the African national independence struggle on Britain has exceeded any event in recent years except for the Suez incident. This has put the British authorities in an awkward situation of being attacked from both inside and outside on the Nyasaland issue.

In order to get rid of this awkward situation, the British authorities launched a large-scale "sweep" for nine days from mid-March to late March, vainly attempting to quickly quell the situation in Nyasaland. On March 23, the British government also published a white paper on the recent situation in Nyasaland, justifying the bloody suppression by the British military police. The white paper openly fabricated a so-called "conspiracy plan" by the Nyasaland African National Congress, insisting that the people of Nyasaland planned to hold a "riot" on "R" day, between the sixteenth and twenty-first days after Banda's arrest, to "massacre" all Europeans and Asians, attempting to incite racial hatred and divert people's attention from the bloody suppression by British colonialism.

However, recent facts have proved that this trick of the British authorities has also failed. The large-scale "sweep" for nine days was met with resolute resistance from the people of Nyasaland. Western news agencies revealed the situation of this sweep, saying that "people from entire villages came out to attack patrols with rifles, mortars and light machine guns." The "resistance" of the people of Nyasaland "is increasing day by day." People destroyed roads and planted corn. Women prepared food for the national fighters and passed on messages. Fully armed colonial military police are in a very isolated situation among the angry African people.

The British authorities' white paper has also aroused new widespread dissatisfaction and attacks from domestic public opinion. The British public indignantly exposed the shameful act of fabricating facts in the white paper. Even the "Scotsman" and the "Manchester Guardian" believe that the white paper "only provides one side of the story" and its authenticity "cannot be judged." The "Times" also pointed out that the white paper attempts to get rid of the accusations that are constantly raised, but it is difficult to estimate the authenticity of the "conspiracy." Reuters reported that "the general view" in London "is that" the white paper has failed to provide strong evidence for the "so-called 'massacre conspiracy'."

Under these circumstances, the British colonial authorities have once again used another political deception trick that was clearly planned. According to the British government's announcement, the British government will organize a fact-finding mission to "investigate" the Nyasaland incident. British Commonwealth Relations Secretary Home also flew to Central Africa on March 30. Before his departure, Home said that "something completely new is needed in the history of the" Central African "Federation." He intends to peddle a "plan for the future constitutional development phase of the Federation" in Central Africa.

The volcano of the African national independence movement has erupted one after another. The colonial authorities are desperately trying to block the lava-rolling crater, but this is clearly a foolish effort. (Attached picture)

    英国殖民当局的疯狂镇压枉费心机
    尼亚萨兰人民斗争烈火越燃越旺
    本报讯　尼亚萨兰人民大规模的反殖民统治斗争，自1月下旬开始以来，迄今已坚持达七十余天。在这七十多天里，英国殖民当局先后从坦噶尼喀、南北罗得西亚和南非地区调进大批军警，进行疯狂镇压。仅在3月1日一天内，自南罗得西亚前往布兰泰尔的运兵飞机即达七十架之多。3月3日，英国殖民当局又进一步宣布尼亚萨兰进入“紧急状态”，大肆逮捕和杀害尼亚萨兰民族独立战士。到目前为止，已有一百余名非洲人遭到殖民军警的杀害，将近一千名非洲人被捕，其中包括尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达、立法会议议员契佩姆贝雷等民族独立运动领导人物。
    尽管英国殖民当局实行了严密的新闻封锁，但是，从西方通讯社和非洲报纸字里行间可以看出，殖民当局的疯狂镇压，并未能达到它们预期的目的。南罗得西亚的“公民报”说：尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的领袖虽已被捕，“可是种子已经撒下了”，在尼亚萨兰人民中新的坚决斗争的情绪“正在抬头”。南非“金城邮报”的记者还具体地报道了尼亚萨兰民族主义者转入地下，准备进行游击战争的情况。英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”也承认：殖民军警的疯狂镇压活动，已使尼亚萨兰广大人民的愤怒“达到了沸腾的程度”。
    尼亚萨兰人民的反对殖民统治的斗争，在英国国内引起了极大的震动。美国“国民前卫报”报道说：非洲民族独立斗争给予英国的影响，超过除了苏伊士事件以外的近几年任何一次事件。这样，就使英国当局在尼亚萨兰问题上处于内外夹攻的尴尬境地。
    英国当局为了摆脱这种尴尬的处境，自3月中旬到3月下旬，发动了为期九天的大规模“扫荡”，妄想借此迅速平定尼亚萨兰的局势。3月23日，英国政府又发表了一份有关尼亚萨兰最近局势的白皮书，为英国军警的血腥镇压辩解。这份白皮书公然捏造了一个尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的所谓“阴谋计划”，硬说尼亚萨兰人民计划在班达被捕后第十六到二十一天之间的“R”日，举行“暴动”，“屠杀”所有的欧洲人和亚洲人，妄图借此煽起种族仇恨，转移人们对于英国殖民主义血腥镇压的注意力。
    但是，最近的事实证明，英国当局这一套手法也落了空。为期九天的大规模的“扫荡”，遭到了尼亚萨兰人民的坚决抵抗。西方通讯社透露这次扫荡的情况说，“整个村庄的人们都出来袭击拥有步枪、迫击炮和小型机枪的巡逻队”。尼亚萨兰人民的“抵抗正在日益加强”。人民破坏了公路，而且种上了玉米。妇女们为民族战士准备食物，传递消息。全副武装的殖民军警在愤怒的非洲人民中间处境十分孤立。
    英国当局的白皮书，也引起了国内舆论的新的广泛的不满和攻击。英国公众愤慨地揭露白皮书捏造了事实的可耻行径。连“苏格兰人报”和“曼彻斯特卫报”都认为白皮书“只提供了一面之词”，其真实性“无法判断”。“泰晤士报”也指出，白皮书企图摆脱人们不时提出的指责，但很难估计“阴谋”的真实性。路透社报道说，伦敦“一般的看法是”，白皮书并未能对“所谓‘大屠杀阴谋’提出有力的证据”。
    在这种情况下，英国殖民当局又施展了显然是计划好了的另一政治欺骗伎俩。据英国政府宣布，英国政府将组织一个调查团“调查”尼亚萨兰事件。英国联邦关系大臣霍姆也在3月30日飞往中非访问。霍姆在临行前说，在中非“联邦历史上需要一些完全新的东西”。他打算在中非贩卖“联邦未来的制宪发展阶段的计划”。
    非洲民族独立运动的火山在此起彼伏地爆发起来。殖民当局拚命企图堵塞熔岩滚滚的火山口，但是，这显然是一种愚蠢的努力。（附图片）
