Comrades,

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The crimes of British imperialism and Indian expansionists in instigating the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique to betray the motherland and launch an armed rebellion have been resolutely opposed and sternly condemned by the people of all ethnic groups across the country.

In the four years from the first session of the First National People's Congress to the present, our country, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, has achieved brilliant victories on all fronts of socialist construction. In the midst of this, ethnic work has also made great achievements. Now, more than 90% of the minority nationalities in concentrated areas have implemented ethnic regional autonomy, more than 95% of the minority nationalities population have completed democratic reform and socialist transformation, the economy and culture of the minority nationalities have been greatly developed, and the people's living standards have also improved significantly. This has brought about profound changes of great historical significance in the social outlook of the minority nationalities, and the relations of unity, equality, friendship, and cooperation between the unification of the motherland and all nationalities have been unprecedentedly consolidated and developed on a new socialist basis.

Just as the people of all nationalities across the country are leaping forward along the socialist road, British imperialism and Indian expansionists have instigated the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique to openly betray the motherland, launch an armed rebellion, and attempt to use the guise of "Tibetan independence" to split Tibet from the motherland and turn it into their colony or protectorate. This crime of British imperialists, Indian expansionists, and the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique has been resolutely opposed and sternly condemned by the people of all nationalities across the country. Because the people of all nationalities deeply know from their own experience the profound disasters that imperialism, foreign reactionaries, and their lackeys in all nationalities have brought to the people of all nationalities; they also deeply know the tremendous progress and development that the unity and mutual assistance between all nationalities in the unified family of the motherland has brought and will bring to the people of all nationalities.

The Inner Mongolian nationality has crushed the conspiracy of reactionary upper-class elements to collude with imperialism and sell out national interests, implemented national regional autonomy, embarked on the broad road of socialism, and its various construction undertakings have developed rapidly.

Take the Inner Mongolian nationality as an example. In the nearly one hundred years before liberation, the Inner Mongolian nationality suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, the domestic reactionary ruling class, and reactionary forces within the nationality. It was in a state of extremely backward social production, extreme poverty in people's lives, and a sharp decline in population, facing a dying situation. In order to get rid of this situation, the Inner Mongolian people have carried out heroic struggles many times. At that time, there were two completely different roads in front of the Inner Mongolian nationality. One was the road taken by the reactionary upper-class elements: just like the current Tibetan upper-class reactionary elements who collude with British imperialism and Indian interventionists in an attempt to split Tibet, they collude with imperialism and its agents in China, sell out national interests, and engage in so-called puppet governments such as the "Mengjiang Autonomous Government" under the conspiracy of their master, Japanese imperialism, to split China. Traitors such as Demchugdongrub (De Wang) and Li Shou-hsin are the chief culprits representing this road. This road of imperialist lackeys, which once caused great damage to the Inner Mongolian people, has long been severely judged by history, and Mongolian traitors such as Demchugdongrub and Li Shou-hsin, who were once rampant, have also been arrested and brought to justice by the people after liberation. The other road in Inner Mongolia is the road of people's revolution taken by the working people and revolutionary intellectuals: they closely link the fate of their nationality with the fate of the people of all nationalities across the country, jointly opposing imperialist aggression and the rule of the domestic reactionary ruling class. They accepted the leadership of the Communist Party of China, merged their nationality's struggle for liberation into the general current of the great revolution of the entire Chinese people, and actively participated in the revolutionary struggle led by the Communist Party of China, until they achieved complete liberation together with the people of all nationalities across the country and embarked on the broad road of socialism. This is a road that fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the Inner Mongolian people, and it is the only road to victory.

In 1945, after the people of the whole country achieved victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Inner Mongolian people actively carried out preparations for national regional autonomy, and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947. Since then, the Inner Mongolian people have carried out democratic reforms, abolished the feudal system, restored and developed various productions, and actively participated in the Third Revolutionary Civil War. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, along with all ethnic minority areas in the country, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also achieved a great victory in the socialist revolution, and realized the people's commune movement throughout the region. The development of the economy and culture is also very rapid. In particular, the Great Leap Forward in 1958 greatly promoted the great development of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry production and socialist construction in all aspects of the entire autonomous region. Compared with 1958 and 1947, the year the autonomous region was established, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the region increased from 553.8 million yuan to 2,973.2 million yuan, an increase of more than four times; the industrial (including handicraft) output value increased from 52.96 million yuan to 1,156.49 million yuan, an increase of twenty times; the total grain output increased from 3,469 million jin to 11.8 billion jin, an increase of 2.4 times; and the total number of livestock increased from 8.28 million head to 24.47 million head, an increase of nearly two times. On the basis of continuous development of production, the material and cultural life of the people of all nationalities has also been greatly improved. The purchasing power of urban and rural people increased by an average of four and a half times in 1958 compared with 1947. When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established in 1947, there were no institutions of higher learning at all. By 1958, there were 18 institutions of higher learning with 6,041 students. In 1947, there were only 29 secondary schools, which had developed to 700 by 1958; in 1947, there were only 3,769 primary schools, which had developed to 14,700 by 1958. The number of students in secondary schools in 1958 increased nineteen times compared with 1947, and the number of students in primary schools increased by four and a half times. In the eleven years from 1947 to 1958, the number of hospitals increased by thirty-nine times, and the number of beds increased by twenty-five times. Due to the improvement of people's lives and the universal development of health care, the population of all nationalities has increased greatly. Among them, the Mongolian population increased by more than 300,000 people in the eleven years from 1947 to 1958. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is full of a thriving new atmosphere.

The complete victory of the Inner Mongolian people's liberation struggle and the tremendous development achieved since the implementation of regional autonomy fully prove that the road taken by the Inner Mongolian people is the only correct road, and the correctness of this road has also been confirmed by the experiences of other fraternal ethnic minorities in the country. However, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique chose another road, which is the road taken by Mongolian traitors Demchugdongrub (De Wang), Li Shou-hsin, and others who have suffered shameful failures: colluding with imperialism, splitting the unity of the motherland, and selling out national interests.

The so-called "Tibet was a historically independent country" is a complete fallacy. The iron historical fact that Tibet is Chinese territory cannot be denied or overthrown by anyone.

Under the instigation of British imperialism and Indian expansionists, in order to achieve the heinous goal of splitting Tibet from the big family of the motherland, Tibetan traitors shamelessly fabricated various lies, saying that "Tibet was a historically independent country." This is a completely absurd fallacy that Tibetan reactionaries have been clamoring for a long time. We, the Inner Mongolian people, have a long-standing friendship with the Tibetan people, and we regard the fate of the Tibetan people as the same as our own, so we cannot help but say a few more words. Everyone knows that the Tibetan region has long been Chinese territory and an inseparable part of our great motherland. As early as before the Sui and Tang dynasties, the Han and Tibetan peoples had established extensive political, economic, and cultural ties. In the Tang Dynasty, this relationship greatly developed. In the Yuan Dynasty, Emperor Shizu Kublai Khan unified the then divided Tibet and in 1251 granted the title of "Great Yuan Imperial Preceptor" to the Sakya Lama Phagpa of Tibet, and placed the Tibetan region under the administration of the Sakya Lama. Since then, the Tibetan region has been definitively and formally incorporated into the territory of the great motherland. The title of Dalai Lama was also established by the Mongol Khan in the 16th century. The Ming Dynasty also conferred official titles and titles on the Kagyu Lama of Tibet at that time. As soon as the Qing Dynasty was established, the Fifth Dalai Lama went to Beijing to pay homage, and Emperor Shizu (Shunzhi) of the Qing Dynasty conferred the title of "The Great Good Self-Sufficient Buddha Leading the World's Buddhist Teachings, Universal Vajradhara Dalai Lama" on the Fifth Dalai Lama in 1653. Emperor Shengzu (Kangxi) of the Qing Dynasty conferred the title of "Panchen Erdeni" on the Sixth Panchen Lama in 1713. Emperor Gaozong (Qianlong) of the Qing Dynasty established a resident minister in Tibet to handle Tibetan affairs. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the later Kuomintang government also had an office in Lhasa, and the Tibetan local government also had an office in Nanjing. The enthronement ceremony of the current 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso was also presided over by personnel sent by the Kuomintang government at that time. These iron historical facts cannot be denied or overthrown by anyone. The small group of Tibetan traitors who fled to India ignore historical facts and insist that Tibet is an "independent country." What else can this illustrate other than the fact that they have betrayed the motherland and the Tibetan nationality and sold themselves to British imperialists and Indian expansionists?

The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique also presents the argument that "Tibetans are different from Han people" as a basis for their attempt to split Tibet from the family of the motherland, which is also not worth refuting. As far as ethnic relations are concerned, Tibetans and Han Chinese are of course different. But ethnic differences cannot be a reason for Tibet to secede from China. There are many countries in the world composed of multiple ethnic groups. For example, India is a multi-ethnic country, but we have not heard Indian politicians advocate that the various ethnic groups in India should secede from India simply because they are different from the Hindustani people. Obviously, ethnic differences cannot be used as an excuse to split the motherland. Precisely because our country is a multi-ethnic country, and the Han nationality is the main ethnic group in our country, and its political, economic, and cultural development are ahead of all fraternal ethnic groups, strengthening the unity and cooperation between all ethnic groups centered on the Han nationality has become a basic condition for building our socialist motherland and promoting the development and prosperity of all ethnic minorities, and has become a major issue related to the vital interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. The fundamental reason why the economic and cultural construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has developed so rapidly is that the Mongolian and Han peoples have implemented unity and cooperation and jointly struggled under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Years of experience have fully proven that the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups centered on the Han nationality is not only the inevitable result of the historical development of our country, but also the basic guarantee for the development and prosperity of all ethnic groups, and the common highest interest of the people of all ethnic groups. Anyone who attempts to separate their own nationality from the family of the motherland, or opposes unity and cooperation with the Han people within the unified family of the motherland, not only undermines the common interests of the people of all nationalities, but also violates the fundamental interests of their own nationality. This is absolutely not allowed by the people of all nationalities and the people of their own nationality. If they must do so, they can only end up bloodied and suffer a shameful defeat. The rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique and its failure have proven such an undeniable truth with their negative actions.

The Tibetan traitorous clique also falsely claimed that we have not given the Tibetan people the right to "autonomy" and that "the Tibetan local government has not enjoyed any degree of autonomy." This is naturally a lie that is both inconsistent with the facts and has ulterior motives. In China, almost all ethnic minorities with concentrated settlements have implemented regional autonomy, become masters of their own affairs, and manage their own internal affairs. The Inner Mongolian nationality has implemented autonomy for twelve years. It is only in Tibet that the establishment of an autonomous region has not been formally established due to the obstruction of the upper-class reactionary clique. Even the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, established in April 1956, did not do any work because of the sabotage of the upper-class reactionary clique. As mentioned earlier, what they want is not regional autonomy, but the so-called "Tibetan independence" that imperialist aggressors have been planning for many years. Of course, their conspiracy will never be realized.

The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique and their foreign masters have completely miscalculated, and they have chosen the road to rapid death for themselves.

The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique violated the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, opposed social reform in Tibet, and vainly attempted to permanently preserve their serf system. On this issue, in order to wait for the awakening of a small number of upper-class elements in Tibet who were unwilling to reform, the central government had announced that reforms would not be carried out before 1962, and whether reforms would be carried out during the third Five-Year Plan after 1962 would depend on the situation at that time. However, under the instigation of British imperialism and Indian expansionists, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique attempted to separate Tibet from China, openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and launched a rebellion. They thought that this might force the central government to make greater concessions, but unexpectedly, the rebellion was quickly quelled, the connection between Tibet and the motherland and the connection between the Tibetan ethnic group and the ethnic groups in our motherland became more consolidated, and the Tibetan people could embark on the road of democracy and socialism sooner. The rebels objectively did a good thing. Turning a bad thing into a good thing was something that the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique and their foreign masters did not expect. They completely miscalculated and chose the road to rapid death for themselves. The Tibetan serf system is an extremely dark, backward, reactionary, and cruel social system in the world today. There, secular feudal lords and religious feudal lords, who account for about 5% of the population, and their so-called local governments, own all the land and other means of production, while the vast number of serfs not only own nothing, but even their own wives and children are subject to the disposal of the serf owners. Serf owners register the children born to serfs in their account books as property. Serf owners can arbitrarily inflict various corporal punishments on serfs, including flogging, torture, cutting off noses, gouging out eyes, cutting off hands and feet, and cruel executions. Serf owners can also give serfs along with the manor to others as a gift, or as dowry property. Although serfs receive a "share" of land from the serf owner, they must spend most of their time each year performing uncompensated labor on the lord's land, and they must also provide various corvées to the local government, monasteries, and serf owners without compensation. The little time left can only be used to cultivate their own land, so many of the serf's lands are barren. Serfs live an extremely miserable life. In order not to starve to death, serfs can only borrow money from serf owners. More than 71-80% of the serfs in Tibet owe debts to serf owners, many of which are debts that cannot be repaid for generations and that serf owners do not allow to be repaid. Under the cruel oppression and exploitation of the serf owners, serfs have no way out but to fight against the lords by escaping. According to investigation materials, in the past hundred years, the number of serfs who escaped in Tibet has been very alarming. As a result, the productive forces of Tibetan society have been severely damaged, and the development of Tibetan socio-economic development has been greatly hindered. Now, serfs who have been subjected to cruel oppression for generations will soon be liberated, and the Tibetan nation will embark on the road of rapid development and prosperity. Here, we warmly congratulate the rebirth of the Tibetan nation.

Our adherence to the policy of freedom of religious belief does not mean that we can organize rebellions and betray the motherland in the name of religious belief without being subject to sanctions by the state and the people.

The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique also put forward the slogan of "protecting religion" in an attempt to confuse the masses and expand the rebellion. But their hopes also failed. Because facts are ultimately the most eloquent. In recent years, the People's Liberation Army and staff working in Tibet have strictly implemented the Party and the state's policy of freedom of religious belief, earnestly respected the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people, effectively protected the lama temples, and widely united patriotic people from all walks of life in the religious community. Even in the process of quelling the rebellion, the People's Liberation Army did everything possible to protect the lama temples and cultural relics. These facts have been seen by the Tibetan people with their own eyes. No matter how much the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique slanders and smears, they cannot obliterate these iron facts, nor can they undermine the high prestige established by the Party and the state among the Tibetan people. Of course, our adherence to the policy of freedom of religious belief does not mean that we can organize rebellions and betray the motherland in the name of religious belief without being subject to sanctions by the state and the people, nor does it mean that the lama temples can become bases and shelters for counter-revolutionary rebellious armed forces to attack the People's Liberation Army, while the People's Liberation Army cannot fight back. Anyone who betrays the motherland and carries out a rebellion, no matter what religion they believe in, must be punished by state law and punished by the people. This is what they deserve. The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique verbally shouted "protecting religion," but in reality they instructed the rebels to openly burn, kill, loot, and harm the masses. The lives and property of the people cannot be preserved, so what freedom of religious belief is there to speak of? Obviously, only by eliminating this rebellious group can the Tibetan people obtain true freedom of religious belief.

Reactionaries in all nationalities often disguise themselves as defenders of national interests, but in reality, they are traitors to national interests. What they care about is not the interests of the laboring people who account for more than 90% of the nationality, but the selfish interests of a very small number of exploiting classes. For this reason, they do not hesitate to sell out their own nationality, betray their own motherland, and collude with imperialism and foreign reactionaries. This was the case with the reactionaries in Inner Mongolia in history, and it is also the case with the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique today. Only by resolutely and thoroughly quelling the rebellion in the Tibetan region, eliminating all the remaining forces of imperialism and foreign reactionaries in Tibet, can we consolidate the unification of the motherland and further strengthen the unity between all ethnic groups in our country, ensure the victorious progress of our socialist construction cause, and thus enable the Tibetan nation to quickly embark on the road to happiness and prosperity.

All those who truly care about Sino-Indian friendship and uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence must be highly vigilant against the sabotage of Sino-Indian friendly relations by imperialists and Indian expansionists.

Finally, it must be pointed out that the Tibetan rebellion and the quelling of the Tibetan rebellion are both China's internal affairs, and no foreign country is allowed to interfere. It is worth noting that after the Tibetan rebellion occurred, some Indian officials and political activists showed special "enthusiasm" and "sympathy" for the small group of Tibetan traitors, as if they were their own flesh and blood. Some Indian expansionists openly issued various clamors to interfere in China's internal affairs, saying that China's sovereignty over Tibet has "no historical basis," that the relationship between India and Tibet is a "mother-son relationship," and so on, simply regarding China's Tibet as part of India. Imperialism, while frantically attacking the Chinese people, desperately started up propaganda machines to provoke friendly relations between China and India. In this case, all those who truly care about Sino-Indian friendship and uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence must be highly vigilant against the sabotage of Sino-Indian friendly relations by imperialists and Indian expansionists. The people of all nationalities in China have always cherished the friendship with the Indian people very much, but British imperialists and Indian expansionists have regarded our friendly expressions as weakness and vulnerability, and have increasingly shown interference in our internal affairs, wanting to split Tibet from China through the hands of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary elements and turn it into their colony or protectorate. We want to warn those Indian expansionists who have inherited the inglorious legacy of British imperialism on the Tibetan issue to keep your heads cool. The 600 million Chinese people have stood up, and the era of China being bullied and oppressed is gone forever. No foreign reactionary forces can split Tibet from China, cannot save the demise of the Tibetan reactionaries, and cannot stop the Tibetan people from advancing along the road of democracy and socialism!

Let those imperialists and reactionaries howl! Victory belongs to the people of all nationalities in China!

专栏：

    正告英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子
    休想把西藏从中国分裂出去！
    乌兰夫代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策动西藏上层反动集团背叛祖国，发动武装叛乱的罪行，受到全国各族人民的坚决反对和严正声讨
    从第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议到现在的四年多时间中，我们的国家在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，在建设社会主义的各个战线上都取得了辉煌的胜利。在这中间，民族工作也取得了伟大的成就。现在，百分之九十以上的聚居的少数民族已经实行了民族区域自治，百分之九十五以上的少数民族人口完成了民主改革和社会主义改造，少数民族的经济和文化得到了巨大的发展，人民生活也有了显著的改善。这就使少数民族的社会面貌发生了具有重大历史意义的深刻变化，祖国的统一和各民族之间的平等、团结、友爱、合作的关系在新的社会主义的基础上获得了空前的巩固和发展。
    正当全国各民族人民沿着社会主义道路飞跃前进的时候，英帝国主义和印度的扩张主义分子竟策动西藏上层反动集团公然背叛祖国，发动了武装叛乱，企图借“西藏独立”的幌子把西藏从祖国分裂出去，成为它们的殖民地或保护国。英帝国主义者、印度扩张主义者和西藏上层反动集团的这种罪行受到了全国各民族人民的坚决反对和严正声讨。因为各民族人民从他们的切身体验中深深地知道，帝国主义、外国反动派和他们在各民族中的走狗，曾经给各民族人民带来过如何深重的灾难；他们也深深地知道，在统一的祖国大家庭中，经过各民族间的团结互助，已经并将使各民族人民获得何等巨大的进步和发展。
    内蒙古民族粉碎了反动上层分子投靠帝国主义出卖民族利益的阴谋，实行了民族区域自治，走上了社会主义的广阔大道，各项建设事业飞跃发展
    就拿内蒙古民族来说吧。内蒙古民族在解放以前的近百年来，饱尝了帝国主义、国内反动统治阶级和民族内部反动势力的残酷压迫和剥削，长期处于社会生产极为落后、人民生活极为贫困和人口急剧下降的衰亡境地。内蒙古人民为了摆脱这种状况，曾经多次进行过英勇的斗争。当时在内蒙古民族面前存在着两条截然不同的道路。一条是反动的上层分子所走的道路：就如同现在西藏的上层反动分子投靠英帝国主义和印度干涉者企图把西藏分裂出去一样，他们投靠帝国主义及其在国内的代理人，出卖民族利益，并且在他们的主子——日本帝国主义分裂中国的阴谋下搞什么所谓“蒙疆自治政府”之类的傀儡政府。如臭名彰著的德穆楚克栋鲁布（德王）、李守信等蒙奸就是代表这个道路的首恶分子。这条曾经给内蒙古人民以极大损害的帝国主义走狗的道路早已受到了历史严正的判决，而曾经嚣张一时的德穆楚克栋鲁布、李守信之类的蒙奸分子也在解放后被人民一一逮捕，归案法办。内蒙古的另一条道路是劳动人民和革命知识分子所走的人民革命的道路：他们把自己民族的命运同全国各民族人民的命运紧紧联系起来，共同反对帝国主义侵略和国内反动统治阶级的统治。他们接受中国共产党的领导，把自己民族求解放的斗争汇入全中国人民大革命的总流中来，并且积极参加中国共产党所领导的革命斗争，直至和全国各民族人民一起获得彻底解放，走上社会主义的广阔大道。这是一条完全符合内蒙古民族人民根本利益的道路，也是唯一的胜利道路。
    一九四五年在全国人民取得了抗日战争的胜利后，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，内蒙古人民积极地进行了民族区域自治的准备工作，并在一九四七年建立了内蒙古自治区。此后，内蒙古人民进行了民主改革，废除了封建制度，恢复和发展了各项生产，并且积极参加了第三次国内革命战争。中华人民共和国成立之后，和全国各民族地区一道，内蒙古自治区也取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利，并且在全区实现了人民公社化。在经济、文化的发展方面，也是很迅速的。特别是一九五八年的大跃进，大大地促进了全自治区工、农、牧、林业生产和各方面社会主义建设的大发展。以一九五八年和自治区成立的一九四七年相比，全区工农业总产值由五亿五千三百八十多万元增至二十九亿七千三百二十万元，增长了四倍以上；工业（包括手工业）产值由五千二百九十六万元增至十一亿五千六百四十九万元，增长了二十倍；粮食总产量由三十四亿六千九百多万斤增至一百一十八亿斤，增加了二点四倍；牲畜总头数由八百二十八万多头增至二千四百四十七万多头，增加了近两倍。在生产不断发展的基础上，各族人民的物质和文化生活也有了很大的改善。城乡人民的购买力，一九五八年比一九四七年平均增加四倍半。在一九四七年内蒙古自治区成立的时候，根本没有高等学校，到一九五八年已有高等学校十八所，学生六千零四十一人。中等学校一九四七年只有二十九所，一九五八年已发展到七百所；小学校一九四七年只有三千七百六十九所，一九五八年已发展到一万四千七百所。中学在校学生一九五八年比一九四七年增加了十九倍，小学在校学生增加了四倍半。在一九四七年到一九五八年的十一年内，医院增加了三十九倍，病床增加了二十五倍。由于人民生活的提高，卫生保健事业的普遍展开，各民族人口都有了很大增长，其中蒙古族人口在一九四七年到一九五八年的十一年里，增加了三十多万人，内蒙古自治区到处呈现了一片欣欣向荣的新气象。
    内蒙古人民解放斗争的彻底胜利和实行区域自治以来所取得的巨大发展，充分证明了内蒙古人民所走的道路是唯一正确的道路，这条道路的正确性也已经同样地被国内其他兄弟少数民族的经验所证实。但是西藏的上层反动集团却选择了另外的一条道路，这就是蒙奸德穆楚克栋鲁布（德王）、李守信等所走过并且已经遭受了可耻失败的，投靠帝国主义、分裂祖国统一和出卖民族利益的道路。
    所谓“西藏在历史上是一个独立国”，是彻头彻尾的谬论。西藏是中国领土这一铁的历史事实，是谁也抵赖不了、推翻不倒的
    西藏的卖国贼在英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的指使之下，为了达到把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去的罪恶目的，无耻地捏造各种谎言，说什么“西藏在历史上是一个独立国”，这是西藏反动分子叫嚣已久的一种彻头彻尾的谬论。我们内蒙古人民同西藏人民有悠久的友谊，对于西藏人民的命运看得同我们自己的命运一样，不能不多说几句话。谁都知道，西藏地方长期以来就是中国的领土，是我们伟大祖国不可分割的一部分。远在隋唐以前，汉、藏两族人民就建立了政治、经济、文化各方面的广泛联系。在唐朝，这种关系有了很大的发展。到了元朝，世祖忽必烈统一了当时四分五裂的西藏，于一二五一年封西藏萨迦法王八思巴为“大元帝师”，并将西藏地方交由萨迦法王管理。从此以后，西藏地方就确定不移地正式地纳入了伟大祖国的版图。达赖喇嘛的称号，也是后来十六世纪的蒙古可汗规定的。明朝对当时的西藏噶举法王也封了官爵，授予封号。清朝一建立，五世达赖就到北京朝拜，清世祖（顺治）于一六五三年封五世达赖为“西天大善自在佛所领天下释教普通瓦赤喇怛喇达赖喇嘛”。清圣祖（康熙）又于一七一三年封六世班禅为“班禅额尔德尼”。清高宗（乾隆）在西藏设置了驻藏大臣，处理西藏事务。后来的国民党政府蒙藏委员会也在拉萨驻有办事处，西藏地方政府也在南京驻有办事处。现在的十四世达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措的坐床典礼，也是在当时国民党政府派员主持下进行的。这些铁的历史事实，是谁也抵赖不了、推翻不倒的。西藏的逃亡印度的一小撮卖国贼不顾历史事实，硬说西藏是什么“独立国”，这除了说明他们已经背叛祖国、背叛西藏民族而卖身给英帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子以外，还能说明什么呢？
    西藏上层反动集团，还拿出什么“西藏人不同于汉人”来作为他们妄图把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去的论据，这也是不值一驳的。作为民族关系来说，藏族和汉族当然是不同的。但是民族的不同绝不能成为西藏应从中国分裂出去的理由。在世界上有许多由多民族组成的国家，例如印度就是一个多民族的国家，但是，我们并没有听说印度的政治家们主张印度的各个民族因为和印度斯坦族不同就应当从印度分裂出去。很明显，民族的不同绝不能作为分裂祖国的借口。正因为我国是一个多民族的国家，而汉族又是我国的主体民族，它的政治、经济、文化发展都走在各兄弟民族的前面，所以加强以汉族为中心的各民族之间的团结合作，就成为建设我们的社会主义祖国和促进各少数民族的发展与繁荣的一个基本条件，就成为关系到我国各民族人民的切身利益的一个重大问题。内蒙古自治区的经济、文化建设之所以发展的这样快，根本原因就是因为在中国共产党的领导下，蒙族人民和汉族人民实行了团结合作、共同奋斗的结果。多年来的经验已经充分证明，祖国的统一和以汉族为中心的各民族之间的团结，这不仅是我国历史发展的必然结果，而且是各民族获得发展与繁荣的基本保证，是各民族人民共同的最高利益。任何人如果企图把自己的民族从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，或者反对在统一的祖国大家庭内与汉族人民实行团结合作，就不仅破坏了各民族人民的共同利益，而且首先是违背了本民族人民的根本利益，这是各民族人民和本民族人民绝对不能允许；如果他们一定要这样作，就只能使他们自己碰得头破血流，遭到可耻的失败。西藏上层反动集团的叛乱及其失败，就是用他们的反面行动证明了这样一个颠扑不破的真理。
    西藏叛国集团还胡说什么我们没有给西藏人民“自治”权利，“西藏地方政府没有享受任何程度的自治”。这自然也是一种既不符合事实而又别有用心的谎言。在中国几乎所有有聚居区的少数民族都已经实行了区域自治，当家作主，自己管理着自己的内部事务，内蒙古民族实行自治已经有十二年之久。只是在西藏这一块地方，由于上层反动集团的阻挠，直到现在还没有正式成立自治区，即使是在一九五六年四月成立的西藏自治区筹备委员会，也因为上层反动集团的破坏而没有做什么工作。如前所说，他们要的并不是什么区域自治，而是英帝国主义侵略者多年来策划的所谓“西藏独立”。当然他们的这种阴谋是永远也实现不了的。
    西藏上层反动集团和他们的外国主子的算盘完全打错了，他们自己给自己选择了迅速死亡的道路
    西藏上层反动集团违反和平解放西藏的十七条协议，反对在西藏实行社会改革，妄想永远保存他们的农奴制度。中央在这个问题上为了等待西藏少数不愿改革的上层分子的觉悟，曾经宣布在一九六二年前不进行改革，在一九六二年后的第三个五年计划期间是否进行改革，还要到那时看情况再定。但是西藏的上层反动集团在英帝国主义和印度的扩张主义分子的指使之下，想把西藏从中国分裂出去，公开地撕毁十七条协议，发动了叛乱。他们以为这样也许可以迫使中央作更大的让步，却不料叛乱被迅速平息，西藏同祖国的联系、藏族和我们祖国大家庭的各民族的联系更加巩固，西藏人民因此可以早日走上民主和社会主义的大道，叛乱分子在客观上却是作了好事了。坏事变成好事，这是西藏上层反动集团和他们的外国主子没有预料到的。他们的算盘完全打错了，自己给自己选择了迅速死亡的道路。西藏的农奴制度，是现在世界上的一种极端黑暗、落后、反动和残酷的社会制度。在那里，占人口5％左右的世俗封建主和宗教封建主以及他们的所谓地方政府，占有着全部的土地和其他生产资料，而广大的农奴不仅一无所有，而且连他们自己的妻室子女也是听任农奴主支配的。农奴主把农奴生下的子女如同财产一样，登记在自己的帐簿上。农奴主可以随便对农奴施加各种肉刑，包括鞭笞、拷打、割鼻、挖眼、砍去手脚和残酷处死。农奴主并且可以把农奴连同庄园一起赠送给别人，还可以作为陪嫁的财产。农奴虽然从农奴主手里领得“一分”土地，但是每年要以大部分时间在领主的土地上进行无偿的劳动，并且还要无偿地给地方政府、寺院和农奴主支服各种差役，剩下来的一点时间才能耕种自己的份地，所以农奴的份地许多都是荒芜的。农奴过着极为悲惨的生活。农奴为了不被饿死，只有向农奴主借债。全西藏百分之七十一八十以上的农奴都欠着农奴主的债，其中很多是世世代代不可能还清和农奴主不允许还清的子孙债。在农奴主的这种残酷的压迫和剥削下，农奴无路可走，只有用逃亡的办法和领主进行斗争。根据调查材料，近百年来，西藏农奴逃亡的数量十分惊人，西藏社会的生产力因此遭到了严重的破坏，西藏社会经济的发展也因此受到了极大的阻滞。现在世世代代受着残酷压迫的农奴不要很久就可以获得解放了，西藏民族从此将要走上迅速发展和繁荣的道路。在这里我们热烈地为西藏民族的新生道贺。
    我们坚持宗教信仰自由政策，决不是说可以借宗教信仰之名组织叛乱、背叛祖国，而不受国家和人民的制裁
    西藏上层反动集团还提出什么“保护宗教”的口号，企图以此来迷惑群众，扩大叛乱。但是他们的希望也落空了。因为事实终究是最雄辩的。几年来，进藏人民解放军和工作人员严格地执行了党和国家的宗教信仰自由政策，认真地尊重了西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，切实保护了喇嘛寺庙，广泛地团结了宗教界各阶层的爱国人士；即使在平息叛乱的过程中，人民解放军也尽一切可能保护了喇嘛寺庙和文物古迹。这些事实都是西藏人民亲眼看到的。西藏上层反动集团再怎么造谣中伤，也抹煞不了这些铁的事实，也破坏不了党和国家在西藏人民中树立起来的崇高威信。当然，我们坚持宗教信仰自由政策，决不是说可以借宗教信仰之名，组织叛乱、背叛祖国而不受到国家和人民的制裁，更不是说喇嘛寺庙可以成为反革命叛乱武装进攻人民解放军的根据地和掩体，而人民解放军却不能对之还击。任何人如果背叛祖国，实行叛乱，不管他信仰什么宗教，都必须受到国法的制裁和人民的惩罚，这是他们罪有应得的。西藏上层反动集团在口头上高喊“保护宗教”，而在实际上却指使叛匪明目张胆地烧杀淫掠，残害群众。人民的生命财产都不能保全，还有什么宗教信仰自由可言呢？很明显，只有剿除了这个叛乱集团，才能使西藏人民获得真正的宗教信仰自由。
  　一切民族中的反动派，都常常把自己打扮成民族利益的维护者，实际上他们却是民族利益的叛卖者，他们所关心的不是占民族中百分之九十几的劳动人民的利益，而是极少数剥削阶级一己的私利。为此，他们就不惜出卖自己的民族，背叛自己的祖国，投靠帝国主义和外国反动派。历史上内蒙古的反动派是如此，今天西藏的上层反动集团也是如此。只有坚决、彻底地平息西藏地区的叛乱，肃清帝国主义和外国反动派在西藏的一切残余势力，才能巩固祖国的统一和进一步加强我国各民族之间的团结，保障我国社会主义建设事业的胜利进行，从而也使西藏民族迅速地走上幸福和繁荣的道路。
    一切真正关心中印友好和拥护和平共处五项原则的人，都必须高度警惕帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子对中印友好关系的破坏
    最后，必须指出，西藏叛乱和西藏叛乱的平定，都是中国的内政，绝不允许任何外国加以干涉。值得注意的是，在西藏叛乱发生以后，一些印度的官方人士和政治活动家，对西藏的一小撮卖国贼表现了特别的“热心”和“同情”，好像是他们的亲骨肉一样。一些印度的扩张主义分子则露骨地发出了各种干涉中国内政的叫嚣，说什么：中国对西藏的主权“没有历史根据”，印度和西藏的关系是“母子关系”，等等，简直把中国的西藏当成了印度的一部分。而帝国主义则在疯狂攻击中国人民的同时，拼命开动宣传机器，挑拨中国和印度的友好关系。在这种情况下，一切真正关心中印友好和拥护和平共处五项原则的人，都必须高度警惕帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子对中印友好关系的破坏。中国各民族人民从来就是很珍视和印度人民的友谊的，但是英帝国主义者和印度的扩张主义分子，却把我国的这种友好表现，当做软弱可欺，愈来愈多地表现了对于我国内政的干涉，要经过西藏上层反动分子的手把西藏从中国分裂出去，成为它们的殖民地或保护国。我们要警告那些在西藏问题上继承了英国帝国主义不光荣遗产的印度扩张主义分子，还是把你们的脑袋放冷静一点吧，六亿中国人民已经站起来了，中国任人欺侮和压迫的时代已经永远过去了。任何外国反动力量都不能把西藏从中国分裂出去，都不能挽救西藏反动派的灭亡，都不能阻止西藏人民沿着民主和社会主义大道前进！
    让那些帝国主义和反动派去嚎叫吧，胜利是属于中国各民族人民的！
