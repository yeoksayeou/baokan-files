Presidium, fellow representatives:

    We fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress."

    Premier Zhou's report comprehensively and correctly analyzed and summarized the achievements and experiences of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction in various aspects over the past few years, especially in 1958. It clearly pointed out the various tasks, guidelines, and policies for 1959, which has given us profound education and great encouragement. We will resolutely carry out work in various aspects according to the direction indicated, ensuring the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the various production and construction tasks assigned to Shenyang City by the state.

    Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of Shenyang City, like the people of the whole country, achieved unprecedentedly great victories in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, whether on the political and ideological front or on the economic and cultural front.

    In 1958, the city's total industrial output value completed 115.4 percent of the state plan, an increase of 73.4 percent over 1957. The technical level of industrial production also improved rapidly. More than 4,000 new products were successfully trial-produced throughout the year. Capital construction completed 112 percent of the total state investment, an increase of 73.8 percent over 1957. Railway transportation, highway transportation, agricultural production, as well as other financial and trade, scientific research, cultural, educational, and health aspects have all made great progress. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in production, the people's material and cultural life has also been improved accordingly. Not only has the family income of workers increased, but the retail price of goods has also decreased by 3.2 percent compared with the previous year. All these facts, as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, show that the development of our country's national economy in 1958 was not a general advance, but a huge and comprehensive leap forward.

    1959 is the second year of our country's Second Five-Year Plan for socialist construction, and it is a year of decisive significance. The draft national economic plan for 1959, proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and adopted by the Seventh Plenary Session, is a magnificent and comprehensive leap forward plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. To complete and overfulfill this plan is the glorious task of the people of the whole country. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: The most urgent task of the machinery industry at present is to quickly manufacture the mining equipment, coal washing equipment, coking equipment, steel rolling equipment, power station equipment, irrigation and drainage equipment, and locomotive vehicles stipulated in the plan. Shenyang is an industrial city centered on the machinery industry and bears a significant responsibility in ensuring the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipment. The people of the city are fighting with soaring enthusiasm and hundredfold confidence to resolutely ensure the early completion of the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state.

    We have many favorable conditions in completing the tasks of 1959: (1) The wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is the fundamental guarantee for our victory; (2) The general line of socialist construction illuminates the road of the Great Leap Forward, and the policy of "the whole country as a chessboard" and "walking on two legs" points out a clear direction; the new and favorable situation after the people's commune is constantly developing; (3) The political awareness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly enhanced, and their enthusiasm and persistence have become even higher. A massive and vigorous new upsurge of production and construction is taking shape; (4) This year's leap forward indicators have been meticulously and repeatedly calculated. Therefore, it is built on a very reliable objective basis. Moreover, we started early this year, five months earlier than last year; (5) A series of practical and feasible organizational work and specific measures have been preliminarily adopted from the city to the grassroots units; (6) We have preliminarily gained experience in launching mass movements on a large scale, carrying out technical revolution on a large scale, tapping potential, overcoming difficulties, and organizing production upsurges; (7) During the First Five-Year Plan period, thanks to the care of the Party and the state, with the help of Soviet experts, and with the support of fraternal cities across the country, Shenyang has been built into one of the industrial bases with modern equipment, with relatively good technical conditions; and since Shenyang is a comprehensive city centered on the machinery industry, it is easy to organize large-scale production cooperation. All these favorable conditions are a reliable guarantee for us to complete and overfulfill the 1959 leap forward plan.

    In order to resolutely guarantee the completion of the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipment and the comprehensive leap forward plan, we have taken and are taking the following actions and measures:

    First, continue to adhere to putting politics in command and launch mass movements on a large scale. In order to mobilize the masses of workers to ensure the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipment are completed on time, in quantity, with quality, and as a set, we have successively convened a city-wide broadcast meeting for competitions, a mass meeting of more than 35,000 people, a meeting of labor models and advanced producer representatives, and the recently convened five-level cadre meeting. All enterprises have convened worker congresses or worker representative congresses. Leading cadres at all levels have directly met with the masses, deeply publicized the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, summarized the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, conducted education on "the whole country as a chessboard," and clarified the situation and tasks of 1959. After mass airing of views, debates, and discussions, cadres at all levels and the broad masses of workers have further established a communist style, with soaring enthusiasm. The Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant received an urgent task from the state at the end of January to produce 80 coal washing machines, to be completed by early May. At that time, the first quarter plan had already been tightly scheduled. To complete the task of 80 coal washing machines, there were many difficulties in terms of manpower, equipment, and technology. However, because they understood that completing the 80 coal washing machines one month ahead of schedule would allow for the production of an additional 5.76 million tons of washed coal, which would play an important role in supporting 18 million tons of steel, they quickly launched a high-yield, high-quality red flag competition led by the Party committee, centered on coal washing machines and technical revolution, and based on putting politics in command, concentrating manpower and material resources, shortening the front line, and breaking through one by one, launching an annihilation war on coal washing machines. As a result, they overcame various difficulties and completed the task 43 days ahead of schedule. The soaring enthusiasm and the practice of concentrating forces to fight an annihilation war by the plant's workers reflects the enthusiasm and labor passion of the city's workers.

    Second, unified arrangements, implement plans, seize measures, seize progress, and launch high-yield, high-quality red flag competitions on a large scale. In order to strengthen leadership and ensure the completion of the six major equipment on time, in quantity, with quality, and as a set, the Municipal Party Committee organized a production headquarters, led by the secretary, with six leading groups established. From the city to the factory, based on the principle of concentrating forces, ensuring key points, and specialized division of labor, the production tasks were ranked according to the principle of urgent and important, and the production plan was arranged with the six major equipment as the main focus. Give full play to the role of specialized factories, organize factories with similar processes to cooperate with them, and uniformly mobilize casting and forging forces to serve the six major equipment. According to the length of the technological process, the speed of production progress, the complexity of the product, and the supply of raw materials, production progress was arranged, thereby shortening the production process of the six major equipment.

    Inspection work has been strengthened from the city to the factory. The Municipal Party Committee dispatched 180 cadres to form 26 inspection groups, which went to key factories to help and inspect work. Factory leaders seized it once a day, and workshops and groups seized it several times a day, forming a situation where the whole factory seized the plan, and everyone seized the plan.

    While implementing the plan and seizing measures on a large scale, high-yield and high-quality red flag competitions were widely and deeply carried out. A red flag competition craze was launched between factories and factories, workshops and workshops, groups and groups, individuals and individuals, work types and work types, comparing ideology, comparing enthusiasm, comparing production, comparing quality, comparing innovation, comparing collaboration, comparing safety, and comparing learning. "Full of red flags in April, high-yield and high-quality celebrate May Day"; "Leap forward again, strive for the red flag in Beijing"; have become the slogans of action for the broad masses of workers. Various enterprises have created many novel forms of competition, such as high-quota and bumper harvest competitions, key competitions, full of red flags competitions, red flag hand competitions, thousand-machine-hour competitions, and so on. The competition movement is in full swing, which has played a significant role in ensuring the completion of the six major equipment tasks on time, in quantity, with quality, and as a set. After the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant launched the "Double Leap Forward (ideology and production) Thousand-Machine-Hour" red flag competition, by March 25, the entire plant had 221 workers, 35 machine tools, 39 groups, and one section that had achieved the thousand-machine-hour target according to schedule, and some even reached "Double Thousand-Machine-Hours." The production efficiency of the entire plant increased by 11.9 percent compared with the highest month in the Great Leap Forward last year, effectively ensuring the timely manufacturing success of the 750 primary rolling mill and the four-roller cold press. The workers of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, in order to ensure the completion of the six major equipment tasks on time and ahead of schedule, organized a full of red flags competition, doing practical work, doing skillful work, everyone working together, working together with one heart, and "offering treasures" to each other. In March, ten "workshop full of red flags days" of high production, high quality, and safety appeared one after another. The workers sang in praise:

    "Water pump workers have high enthusiasm, a great battle to protect six, see today;
    Leap forward, leap forward again, triple it still not giving up;
    Show great skills to seize high production, strive for the red flag to fly throughout the factory."

    Third, "Pass five passes, slay six generals," making a big fuss about technological revolution and technical innovation. Because the task of the six major equipment is large, the requirements are urgent, the technology is complex, and there are still some difficulties in raw materials, equipment, manpower, electricity, transportation, etc., whether it can be completed on time, in quantity, with quality, and as a set is a serious test for the city's workers. Under the leadership of the Party, under the ideological guidance of despising difficulties strategically and valuing difficulties tactically, and under the encouragement of the battle cry of "passing five passes, slaying six generals," the city's workers are making a big fuss about technological revolution and technical innovation in response to the "five passes." Making a big fuss about raw material substitution, modification, utilization, saving, and selection; making a big fuss about product design revolution; tapping the potential of equipment, making a big fuss about indigenous equipment; improving labor organization; making a big fuss about process and tool reform; and making a big fuss about mechanization and automation. The Shenyang Water Pump Factory accepted the task of more than 700 5KC water pumps for power station supporting equipment in various places, but there were difficulties in the materials and castings for making this kind of water pump, and they could not be put into production in time. In order to solve this key, the factory's leading cadres, workers, and technicians worked hard to study and repeatedly experiment, and finally reformed the 3K6 water pump with the same flow rate, reducing the weight of each unit by four-fifths, shortening the manufacturing man-hours by one-tenth, and improving the water pump efficiency by 5 percent. This innovation alone can save the state more than 300 tons of steel. The reform of the water trough part of the coal washing machine and the conversion of the vertical air cylinder to a horizontal one by the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant doubled the product performance and saved the state 240 tons of steel. The 10,000 kVA electric furnace transformer produced by the Shenyang Transformer Factory, which was originally large, bulky, and heavy, has been reformed into small, exquisite, and precise, reducing the weight from the original 42 tons to 23 tons, and saving 50 percent of transformer oil, 70 percent of exhaust pipes, 50 percent of copper wire, and 30 percent of silicon steel sheets.

    The casting, forging, and riveting workshops, where the proportion of manual labor is relatively large, are weak links in completing the tasks of the six major equipment. Therefore, mechanization and toolization movements have been widely carried out in these workshops, thereby rapidly increasing production capacity. The casting workshop of the Shenyang Xingjian Punching and Shearing Machine Tool Factory fully mobilized the masses to carry out a mechanization movement. In just 50 days, the main processes such as sand screening, modeling, sand mold transportation, and pouring were basically mechanized, greatly improving labor conditions, increasing production efficiency by more than 40 percent, completing the first quarter plan five days ahead of schedule, and reducing the scrap rate to 0.39 percent.

    Cultivating technical strength and improving technical level is an important method to solve the shortage of labor force. This year, the production tasks of many factories have increased several times, and it is difficult to complete the tasks by relying only on the original old workers. How to cultivate the existing huge team of apprentices and rapidly improve their technical level has become an important issue in completing the tasks of the six major equipment. Many factories have accelerated the improvement of apprentices' technical level through the method of one teacher with multiple apprentices, the method of those who are capable as teachers, and the principle of combining ideological education and technical education. A workshop of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory adopted the method of "one talk, two studies, and three boldness" (one talk is that the master talks about operating methods and safety knowledge; two studies are that the apprentice studies theory and studies practical knowledge; three boldness is that the master teaches boldly, the apprentice learns boldly, and does boldly after learning) to train apprentices. Now most of the 201 apprentices in this workshop have learned how to hammer and help pliers work. The old worker Zhang Weixian in the casting workshop of the factory took 19 apprentices alone, and in just over three months, they generally reached the level of Grade 2 to Grade 3 workers.

    From the large-scale breaking of the "five passes" and the large-scale technological revolution and technical innovation movement in various factories, it can be further seen that the principles and methods such as putting politics in command, breaking superstitions, respecting science, and implementing the three-in-one combination have been mastered by the broad masses of cadres and workers, and are constantly exerting tremendous power in production and construction.

    Fourth, implement the policy of the whole country as a chessboard, and organize city-wide large-scale cooperation. As Premier Zhou instructed in his report, centralized leadership, unified arrangements, obeying the overall situation, and ensuring key points are important principles for our country to build socialism. In order to ensure the completion of the six major equipment tasks undertaken by our city, and to solve the contradictions of large quantity, complex technology, urgent deadlines, untimely supply of raw materials, and insufficient equipment, electricity, and manpower, we, based on the spirit of one chessboard, mobilized the entire Party and the entire people, and organized a city-wide large-scale communist cooperation, mobilizing the city's equipment, manpower, and material resources to serve the early completion of the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipment. In terms of production, more than 90 large enterprises and more than 100 district and county-owned factories were organized to cooperate, forming a complete production cooperation system including main factories, cooperative factories, and component supporting factories. In order to study and solve problems in production in a timely manner, each factory formed a production technology guidance group, and supported each other in the method of old factories leading new factories, summarized and exchanged experiences, and solved problems in a timely manner, thereby avoiding the phenomenon that a difficulty in one aspect of a factory would affect the entire task. In terms of materials, all usable materials in factories and enterprises were mobilized to support the production of the six major equipment. After five city-wide material adjustments, warehouses were cleared, and more than 10,000 tons of steel and other urgently needed materials suitable for the six major equipment were adjusted to support the production of the six major equipment, alleviating the shortage of raw materials. Transportation and commercial departments also took the initiative to serve the six major equipment. Transportation and power command were formed. For the transportation of materials, parts, etc. belonging to the six major equipment, it was done as soon as it was called, as much as it could be transported, without delay or error. The electricity needed for factories producing the six major equipment was satisfied as much as possible. The commercial department took the initiative to go to the factory to understand the needs of the six major equipment parts and actively organized the supply. Other aspects such as capital construction, culture and health consciously and actively served around this center for their work.

    While taking the above-mentioned measures, we implemented the policy of seizing production and seizing life at the same time, and paid attention to arranging the material and cultural life of the workers. Ensuring that workers eat well, sleep well, and rest well, thereby continuously improving the workers' labor enthusiasm and effectively ensuring the completion of production tasks.

    After taking the above series of measures, various difficulties in production have been basically overcome, ensuring that the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipment assigned to our city by the Party and the state can be completed on time, in quantity, with quality, and as a set. For example, 67.5 percent of power station supporting equipment has been completed; 71.5 percent of mining equipment has been completed; 23.1 percent of locomotive vehicles have been completed; especially irrigation and drainage equipment, which has been completed and over-fulfilled ahead of schedule on April 20; coal washing equipment will complete the national task one month ahead of schedule at the end of April.

    Although we have achieved the above-mentioned results, our experience is still insufficient, and there are still many shortcomings in our work. We must, according to the spirit indicated by Premier Zhou, more fully mobilize the city's workers, make a big fuss about technological revolution and technical innovation, further improve labor productivity, launch a national campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to comprehensively over-fulfill the various production and construction tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state, with the six major equipment as the focus, and to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan in 1959.

    The unification of the motherland is the supreme interest of all ethnic groups in the country. Recently, the original local government of Tibet and a small handful of upper-class reactionary groups, under the instigation and instigation of British imperialists and Indian expansionist elements, carried out armed rebellion and undermined the crimes of national unity, which has been shamefully defeated and aroused the resolute opposition and stern condemnation of the people of the whole country, including the Tibetan people. We express our utmost indignation at the despicable and shameless conspiracy of British imperialism and Indian expansionist elements in the Tibetan issue to split our country's unity and interfere in our internal affairs. We, the strong and great 650 million Chinese people who have stood up, want to warn you imperialists and expansionists: if you don't stay awake and continue to be obsessed with carrying out activities that undermine our country's unity and interfere in our internal affairs, the result will be that you will be bruised and shattered and completely crushed. We express our lofty respect for the glorious victory of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the active support of the Tibetan monks and lay people, in quickly suppressing the rebellion and sweeping away the remnants of the bandits; we are proud that our country has such a heroic and well-trained People's Liberation Army to defend our great motherland. We express our sincere wishes to the Tibetan people who are about to get rid of the shackles of the serf system and build Tibet into a democratic and socialist paradise on earth. The people of Shenyang City guarantee to the conference: under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, together with the people of the whole country, in the struggle against the invasion of Tibet by British imperialists and Indian expansionist elements and interference in our internal affairs, and in the cause of supporting the Tibetan people in carrying out democratic and socialist construction, we will make our due contributions with practical actions.

    确保六大设备按期按量按质按套完成
    刘宝田　张凯代表的联合发言主席团、各位代表：
    我们完全同意和拥护周总理所作的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理所作的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理所作的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，和彭真副委员长所作的“全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告”。
    周总理的报告，全面而正确地分析和总结了几年以来特别是一九五八年我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个方面的成绩和经验，明确地指出了一九五九年的各项任务和方针政策，给我们以深刻的教育和极大的鼓舞，我们一定坚决地按照指示的方向去进行各个方面的工作，保证完成和超额完成国家交给沈阳市的各项生产建设任务。
    沈阳市人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在中共辽宁省委的直接领导下，和全国人民一样，在一九五八年大跃进中，无论在政治、思想战线上，无论在经济、文化战线上，都取得了空前巨大的胜利。
    一九五八年，我市工业总产值完成了国家计划的百分之一百一十五点四，比一九五七年增长了百分之七十三点四；工业生产的技术水平也迅速提高了，全年共试制成功四千多种新产品；基本建设完成了国家投资总额的百分之一百一十二，比一九五七年增长了百分之七十三点八。铁路运输、公路运输、农业生产以及其他财贸、科学研究、文教卫生等方面都有很大发展。在生产大跃进的基础上，人民的物质、文化生活也得到了相应的改善，不仅职工的家庭收入有了增加，而且零售物价比上年度还降低了百分之三点二。这一切事实，正如周总理在报告中所指出的，一九五八年我国国民经济的发展，不是一般的前进，而是一个巨大的、全面的跃进。
    一九五九年是我国进行社会主义建设第二个五年计划的第二年，是具有决定意义的一年。党的八届六中全会所提出的、七中全会所通过的一九五九年国民经济计划草案，是以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的宏伟的全面的跃进计划，完成与超额完成这一计划，是全国人民的光荣任务。周总理在报告中指出：机械工业目前最迫切的任务，在于迅速地把计划规定的采矿设备、洗煤设备、炼焦设备、轧钢设备、电站设备、排灌设备和机车车辆制造出来。沈阳是一个以机械工业为中心的工业城市，在保证六大设备的制造任务中担负着重大责任，全市人民正在以冲天的干劲和百倍的信心，为坚决保证提前完成党和国家交给我们的光荣任务而战斗。
    我们在完成一九五九年的任务中，具有很多的有利条件：（一）党中央和毛主席的英明领导，是我们取得胜利的根本保证；（二）社会主义建设总路线照亮了大跃进的道路，“全国一盘棋”和“两条腿走路”的方针，指出了明确的方向；人民公社化以后的新的有利形势，正在不断发展；（三）广大职工群众政治觉悟大大提高，干劲和钻劲更加高涨，一个声势浩大、轰轰烈烈的生产建设新高潮正在形成；（四）今年的跃进指标，经过了细致反复的计算，因此，它是建立在十分可靠的客观基础之上的；而且今年动手早，比去年要早五个月；（五）从市到基层单位已经初步采取了一系列的切实可行的组织工作和具体措施；（六）我们已经初步取得了大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，挖掘潜力、战胜困难，组织生产高潮的经验；（七）在第一个五年计划期间，由于党和国家的关怀，由于苏联专家的帮助，在全国各兄弟城市的支援下，沈阳已经建设成为一个具有现代化设备的工业基地之一，有比较良好的技术条件；而且由于沈阳市是一个以机械工业为中心的综合性的城市，这就便于组织大规模的生产协作。这一切有利条件是我们完成和超额完成一九五九年跃进计划的可靠保证。
    为了坚决保证完成六大设备的制造任务和全面的跃进计划，我们已经采取和正在采取以下的行动和措施：
    第一，继续坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。为了动员职工群众确保六大设备的制造任务按期、按量、按质、按套地完成，先后召开了全市性的竞赛广播大会，三万五千余人的群众大会，劳动模范、先进生产者代表会议以及最近召开的五级干部会议；各企业都召开了职工大会或职工代表大会，各级领导干部直接和群众见面，深入地宣传了党的八届六中全会的精神，总结了一九五八年大跃进的成绩和经验，进行了“全国一盘棋”的教育，讲清了一九五九年的形势和任务；经过群众大鸣大放大辩论以后，各级干部和广大职工群众进一步树立了共产主义风格，干劲冲天。沈阳矿山机器厂在一月底接到国家生产八十台洗煤机的紧急任务，要在五月上旬全部完成。当时一季度计划已经排的很紧，要完成八十台洗煤机的任务，在人力、设备、技术等方面都有许多困难，但是，由于他们懂得提前一个月完成八十台洗煤机，就能多生产五百七十六万吨洗煤，对于支援一千八百万吨钢具有重要作用。因而在党委领导下，迅速掀起了以洗煤机为纲，以技术革命为中心，以政治挂帅为基础的高产优质红旗竞赛，集中人力、物力，缩短战线，各个击破，对洗煤机展开了歼灭战。结果战胜了种种困难，提前四十三天完成了任务。该厂职工这种冲天干劲和集中力量打歼灭战的作法，反映了全市职工群众的积极性和劳动热情。
    第二，统一安排，计划落实，抓措施，抓进度，大搞高产优质红旗竞赛。为了加强领导，确保六大设备按期、按量、按质、按套地完成，市委组织了生产指挥部，书记挂帅，下设六个领导小组。从市到厂，本着集中力量、保证重点、专业分工的原则，把生产任务按着重重急急的原则进行排队，以六大设备为纲安排生产计划。充分地发挥专业厂的作用，组织工艺相近的工厂与其协作，并统一调动铸造、锻造力量为六大设备服务。按工艺过程长短，生产进度快慢，产品繁简以及原材料供应情况等排出生产进度，从而缩短了六大设备的生产过程。
    从市到厂都加强了检查工作，市委抽调了一百八十名干部组成二十六个检查组，分别到各重点工厂帮助与检查工作。厂领导干部每天抓一次，车间、小组一天抓几次，形成全厂抓计划，人人抓计划。
    在计划落实，大抓措施的同时，广泛深入地开展了高产优质红旗竞赛，厂与厂、车间与车间、小组与小组、个人与个人、工种与工种之间，掀起了比思想、比干劲、比生产、比优质、比革新、比协作、比安全、比学习的八比红旗竞赛热潮；“四月满堂红，高产优质庆五一”；“跃进再跃进，争取北京领红旗”；已成了广大职工群众的行动口号。各企业创造出许多新颖的竞赛形式，如高额丰产竞赛，关键竞赛，满堂红竞赛，红旗手竞赛，千台时竞赛等等。竞赛运动热火朝天，对于保证按期、按量、按质、按套地完成六大设备任务，发挥了显著作用。沈阳重型机器厂开展了“双跃进（思想和生产）千台时”红旗竞赛之后，到三月二十五日全厂已有二百二十一名工人，三十五台机床，三十九个小组和一个工段，按进度实现了千台时指标，有的竟达到“双千台时”。全厂生产效率比去年大跃进中最高月份还提高百分之十一点九，有效地保证了750初轧机和四辊冷压机按时制造成功。沈阳水泵厂职工，为保证六大设备任务按时和提前完成。组织了满堂红竞赛，实干、巧干、大家合干、齐心协力、互相“献宝”，在三月份先后出现了十个高产、优质、安全的“车间满堂红日”。提前七天完成了第一季度跃进计划。工人歌颂说：
    “水泵工人干劲高，大战六保看今朝；
    跃进跃进再跃进，翻了三番还不饶；
    大显身手夺高产，争取全厂红旗飘。”
    第三，“过五关、斩六将”，大闹技术革命和技术革新。由于六大设备的任务量大，要求急，技术复杂，在原材料、设备、人力、电力、运输等方面还存在着若干困难的情况下，能不能按期、按量、按质、按套地完成，对全市职工来说，是一场严重的考验。全市职工在党的领导下，在战略上藐视困难、战术上重视困难的思想指导下，在“过五关、斩六将”的战斗口号的鼓舞下，针对“五关”大闹技术革命和技术革新。大搞原材料的代、改、利、省、拣；大搞产品设计革命；挖掘设备潜力，大搞土设备；改进劳动组织；大搞工艺、工具改革，大搞机械化、自动化。沈阳水泵厂接受了各地电站配套用七百多台5KC水泵的任务，但做这种水泵的材料和铸件都有困难，不能及时投入生产。为了解决这个关键，该厂领导干部、工人和技术人员苦心钻研，反复试验，终于把同流量的3K6水泵加以改革，使每台减轻了五分之四的重量，制造工时缩短了十分之一，水泵效能还提高了百分之五。仅这一项革新就可以为国家节约钢铁三百余吨。沈阳矿山机器厂对洗煤机水槽部分的改革和将立式风缸改成卧式之后，使产品性能提高一倍以上，并为国家节约二百四十吨钢材。沈阳变压器厂生产的一万千伏安电炉变压器，以原来的大、笨、重，改革为小、巧、精，使重量由原来的四十二吨减轻到二十三吨，并可节约百分之五十的变压油，百分之七十的排管，百分之五十的铜线和百分之三十的矽钢片。
    在手工劳动比重较大的铸、锻、铆车间，是完成六大设备任务中的薄弱环节。因而在这些车间中普遍地开展了机械化、胎具化运动，从而迅速地提高了生产能力。沈阳兴建冲剪机床厂铸工车间，充分发动群众，开展了机械化运动，仅五十天内，就把筛砂、造型、砂型输送、浇注等主要工艺过程，基本上实现了机械化，大大改善了劳动条件，提高生产效率百分之四十以上，提前五天完成了一季度计划，废品率降低到百分之零点三九。
    培养技术力量，提高技术水平，是解决劳动力不足的重要方法。今年许多工厂的生产任务成倍地增长，只靠原有的老工人是难以完成任务的。如何把现有庞大的徒工队伍培养起来，迅速提高他们的技术水平，就成为完成六大设备任务的重要问题。不少的工厂通过一师多徒、能者为师的方法和贯彻思想教育和技术教育相结合的原则加速地提高了徒工的技术水平。机车车辆厂一个车间采取“一讲、二学、三大胆”的方法（一讲是师傅讲操作方法和安全知识；二学是徒弟学理论、学实际知识；三大胆是师傅大胆教，徒弟大胆学，学了大胆干）培养徒工，现在这个车间的二百零一名徒工绝大部分学会了开锤和帮钳工作。该厂铸造车间老工人张维贤一人带十九个徒工，仅三个多月时间，普遍达到二至三级工的水平。
    从各厂大破“五关”，大闹技术革命和技术革新运动中，可以进一步看到：政治挂帅，破除迷信，尊重科学，贯彻三结合等原则和方法，已经为广大干部和职工所掌握，并在生产建设中不断发挥着巨大的威力。
    第四，贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，组织全市性的大协作。正如周总理在报告中所指示的，集中领导，统一安排，服从整体，保证重点，是我国建设社会主义的重要原则。为了保证我市所承担的六大设备任务的完成，解决数量大、技术复杂、限期急而原材料供应不及时以及设备、电力、人力等不足的矛盾，我们本着一盘棋的精神，全党全民齐动员，组织了全市性的大规模的共产主义大协作，调动全市的设备、人力和物力，为提前完成六大设备制造任务服务。在生产方面，组织了九十多个大企业和一百多个区、县属的工厂进行协作，组成了一个主体厂、协作厂、部件配套厂等完整的生产协作体系，为了及时研究和解决生产中的问题，各厂分别组成了生产技术指导小组，并以老厂带新厂的办法，互相支援，及时总结交流经验，解决问题，从而避免了一个厂在某一方面有困难而影响整个任务的现象。在物资方面，调动了工厂、企业中的一切可以使用的材料，支援六大设备的生产。经过五次全市性的物资调剂，清查仓库，调剂出了一万多吨适合于六大设备需用的钢材和其它急需物资，支援了六大设备的生产，缓和了原材料不足的局面。交通运输和商业部门，也都主动地为六大设备服务。组成了交通运输和电力指挥部，凡属于六大设备的材料、部件等运输，作到随叫随到，有多少运多少，不压不误；生产六大设备的工厂所需用的电力，尽先满足。商业部门主动到厂了解六大设备的配件需要情况，积极组织供应。其他如基本建设、文化卫生等方面，都自觉而主动地把自己的工作围绕这一中心而服务。
    采取上述各项措施的同时，我们贯彻了抓生产同时抓生活的方针，注意安排了职工的物质文化生活。保证职工吃好、睡好、休息好，从而不断地提高了职工劳动热情，有效地保证了生产任务的完成。
    通过采取上述一系列的措施以后，基本上克服了生产中的各种困难，保证了党和国家交给我市的六大设备制造任务能以按时、按量、按质、按套地完成。如电站配套设备已完成百分之六十七点五；矿山设备已完成百分之七十一点五；机车车辆完成了百分之二十三点一；特别是排灌设备，在四月二十日已提前并超额完成了生产任务；洗煤设备在四月底将提前一个月完成国家任务。
    虽然我们已经取得了以上成绩，但是我们的经验还不足，工作中的缺点还不少，我们一定要根据周总理所指示的精神，更加充分地发动全市职工，大闹技术革命和技术革新，进一步提高劳动生产率，开展全民性的增产节约运动，为全面地超额地完成党和国家交给我们的以六大设备为重点的各项生产建设任务，为实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进计划而奋斗。
    祖国的统一是全国各族人民的最高利益。最近，原西藏地方政府和一小撮上层反动集团在英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的策动、嗾使之下，进行武装叛乱、破坏祖国统一的罪行，已遭到可耻的失败，并激起了全国人民包括西藏人民在内的坚决反对和严正声讨。我们对英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子在西藏问题上所进行的分裂我国统一，干涉我国内政的卑鄙无耻的阴谋鬼计，表示万分愤慨。我们已经站了起来的坚强伟大的六亿五千万中国人民，要警告你们这些帝国主义和扩张主义分子：如果你们不放清醒些，还执迷不悟，胆敢继续进行破坏我国统一，干涉我国内政的勾当，其结果，将使你们碰得头破血流，遭到彻底粉碎。我们对英勇的中国人民解放军在西藏僧俗人民的积极支持下，迅速平定叛乱、扫荡残匪所取得的辉煌胜利，表示崇高的敬意；对我国有这样一支英勇善战、纪律严明的人民解放军捍卫着我们伟大的祖国而感到自豪。我们对西藏人民即将摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，把西藏建设成为一个民主的、社会主义的人间乐园而表示真诚的祝愿。沈阳市人民向大会保证：在党中央、毛主席和国务院英明、正确领导之下，同全国人民一道，在反对英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子侵略我国西藏、干涉我国内政的斗争中，在支援西藏人民进行民主的、社会主义的建设事业中，将以实际行动作出我们应有的贡献。
