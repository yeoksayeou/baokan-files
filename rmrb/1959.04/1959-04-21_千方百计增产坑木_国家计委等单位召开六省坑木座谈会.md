    Strive to Increase the Production of Pit Props
    State Planning Commission and Other Units Convene Pit Prop Symposium of Six Provinces
    (Our dispatch) In order to open up production avenues from various aspects and vigorously increase the production of pit props to meet the needs of the great leap forward in mining and coal production this year, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Forestry recently jointly convened a pit prop production symposium in Beijing with the participation of Liaoning, Shanxi, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Henan provinces.
    The meeting held that: This year's mining and coal output has greatly increased, and the production of pit props must be correspondingly increased. In the past, these six provinces did not produce pit props in large quantities themselves, and the pit props they needed were mostly transferred from the Northeast and the South. Such long-distance transportation resulted in considerable waste of transport capacity. In order to fundamentally solve this problem, the meeting suggested that these six provinces should adopt a "walking on two legs" approach: relying both on the province itself and on other provinces; seeking sources both from virgin forests and from scattered trees around houses and villages; forestry departments should work hard to increase production, and non-forestry departments should also undertake certain tasks, seeking economical substitute materials; both expanding the scope of self-extraction and expanding procurement business, implementing the policy of combining mechanized production and handicraft production. The production and supply of pit props for local mines in the six provinces will not only be of great significance in meeting the growing needs of pit props nationwide, but will also be very beneficial to alleviating the tense situation of railway transportation.

    千方百计增产坑木
    国家计委等单位召开六省坑木座谈会
    本报讯　为了从多方面开辟生产门路，大力增产坑木，满足今年采矿、煤炭生产大跃进的需要，最近，国家计委、煤炭工业部、林业部在北京联合召开了辽宁、山西、河北、陕西、山东、河南六省坑木生产座谈会。
    会议认为：今年采矿和煤炭的产量都有很大的增长，坑木的生产必须相应地赶上去。由于这六省过去自己不大量生产坑木，需用的坑木，多是从东北、南方调运去的。这样经过长距离的运输，运力的浪费是相当大的。为了从根本上解决这一问题，会议建议这六个省要采取两条腿走路的方法：既依靠省内，又依靠省外；既要从原始森林中找来源，又要从四旁零散树木中找来源；既要林业部门努力增产，又要非林业部门担负起一定的任务，寻找节约代用材料；既要扩大自采范围，又要扩大收购业务，实行机械生产和手工业生产并举的方针。六省地方矿井坑木由省内生产供应，不仅在满足全国坑木日益增长的需要方面有重要意义，同时对缓和铁路运输紧张状况也是十分有利的。
