Chairman, fellow committee members:

I wholeheartedly endorse the work reports of Premier Zhou and several other government leaders, and I fully agree with Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee. I only intend to talk about my own experiences regarding the Great Leap Forward. If there is anything inappropriate, please criticize and correct me.

In the past few years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, China's industrial construction has made great progress. In addition to expanding the existing industrial sectors, we have also added some new industrial sectors, and we have also increased the self-sufficiency rate of various materials and equipment. We have shaken off the phenomenon of lacking various major materials and established the initial foundation for socialist industrialization. All this rapid development was unimaginable in our past state of poverty and blankness.

The Great Leap Forward of 1958 increased China's total industrial and agricultural output value by another 65 percent. This leap forward was entirely realized under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line. This unprecedented achievement in human history fully proves that the Party can lead science and technology, and that its leadership art is many times higher than that of bourgeois intellectuals. It once again gave a powerful counterattack to the absurd remarks of the rightists.

The achievements of the Great Leap Forward are not only reflected in the existing material achievements, but also in great gains in ideological construction. Because China's industry was relatively backward in the past, many people held the view of insufficient self-confidence. Not only did we not dare to do what other countries did not have, but we were also afraid that China would not be able to do what other countries already had. As a result, some reasonable suggestions, or suggestions that could be used as directions for improvement and experimentation, were often rejected under the saying "Don't act rashly." During the Great Leap Forward, we accomplished many things that we previously thought China could not do, and we even did some things that other countries had not done. For example, the large-scale bumper harvests in agriculture, the refining of some rare metals, etc., are not already in books. There are even more new working methods and improved designs. Daring to think and dare to act will inevitably produce beneficial results, which is already an ironclad fact. The past idea of regarding Chinese wisdom as second-rate has been largely eliminated. This victory on the ideological front will inevitably play a significant role in our future development.

Although the achievements of the Great Leap Forward are undeniable, there are still some individuals who view it with skeptical eyes. They see that individual Great Leap Forward plans have failed, and they think this is simply terrible, and even doubt whether we should dare to think and dare to act. This view must be corrected. For scientific and technological work, daring to think and dare to act should obviously be based on known experience or theory to seek solutions to problems, and then verified and corrected through experiments. On the other hand, it may also be based on the deduction of experience or theory to question existing theories, and thus through experiments, the solution of the problem has a new direction. This practice of combining theory with practice is what the Party has always taught us in the past. If some suggestions are proven to be incorrect in the work, this is also bound to happen (if all new suggestions are necessarily correct, we don't need to experiment anymore). We must not stop thinking and stop acting because of this. If the original deadlines for certain tasks were too short, and therefore the tasks could not be completed as scheduled, then it was only a mistake of "underestimating the enemy tactically." After correction, the final victory will inevitably be achieved. After gaining last year's work experience, we will undoubtedly complete or overfulfill the established goals in a Great Leap Forward manner this year, daring to think and daring to act.

Premier Zhou also mentioned in his report that work should be carried out with emphasis, which is naturally absolutely necessary. However, I have also heard individual comrades believe that since their work is not a priority, they do not need to intensify their work. There are also individual raw material supply units who, because the orderer is not a key project, are unwilling to supply even though the contract has expired and there are materials in the warehouse (for fear that key projects will need them in the future). This practice will inevitably create a skewed phenomenon. If non-priority work (in engineering, that is, projects that do not belong to mining, coal washing, coking, steel rolling, power stations, irrigation and drainage, and locomotives and vehicles) is slowed down casually, then the passive phenomenon of "treating the head when the head hurts, and treating the foot when the foot hurts" will inevitably occur in the future. There is no need to say more about this reason. It is possible that what I heard is only a very individual phenomenon, but I also mention it here in passing.

Finally, as an old intellectual, I would like to talk about the requirements of the Great Leap Forward situation for the self-transformation of intellectuals. For the vast majority of intellectuals, following the Party and listening to the Party is already heartfelt today. Therefore, in the work, under the leadership of the Party, they have also achieved some small achievements (individual comrades may have achieved relatively large achievements), but these achievements are obviously still unable to meet today's needs. Without a good self-transformation, old intellectuals not only have difficulties in grasping the work guidelines, but may also lose their way on key issues. Even in specific business work, mechanical materialist views often occur, delaying the development of the work. For example, last year, we received many achievements from workers and young intellectuals, and some of them were once criticized by old intellectuals in the work process. The reason for this criticism is often due to the mechanical application of old empirical formulas or data, without using a dialectical point of view to analyze whether the local theory they used is suitable for the existing objective conditions, and thus got the wrong conclusion, hindering the development. In addition, some people neither say "yes" nor say "no," and adopt a reserved attitude towards everything, which is also because they have not grasped the law, and therefore cannot give strong support to correct opinions. From this, it can be seen that without thoroughly breaking with the bourgeois world outlook and truly grasping the world outlook of the working class, although one can work, the work efficiency will not be very high.

If we look at the problems in the aspect of the mass line again, the shortcomings of the old intellectuals are even more prominent. Some comrades may think that this is just a problem of working methods, but if we analyze it in depth, we can see that this working method has its class background. In the old society, the kind working class absolutely could not tell their hard-earned experience and knowledge to their hostile class in order to strive for survival. The same is true for intellectuals, who are unwilling to tell others everything they know completely. Under this situation, it is naturally impossible to take the mass line in engineering technology to serve the bourgeoisie, because the bourgeoisie has no mass base. Today, ten years after liberation, all objective conditions have long changed, but the ideological consciousness remaining in the minds of our old intellectuals has not changed much. They only see the superiority of themselves compared with each mass (in engineering technology knowledge), but do not see the power of the collective wisdom of the masses. This mechanical materialist view of only seeing trees but not forests can only be eliminated in the gradual self-transformation, and only then can the old intellectuals truly transform into members of the working class, give full play to their knowledge, and work well for the great socialist construction.

### 有了跃进的经验　必能更好地跃进  梁守槃委员的发言

    有了跃进的经验　必能更好地跃进
    梁守槃委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周总理和其他几位政府首长的工作报告，完全同意李维汉副主席的常务委员会工作报告。现在只打算就跃进方面谈一谈自己的体会。有不妥的地方，请批评指正。
    在过去的几年中，由于党中央和毛主席的正确领导，我国的工业建设有了很大的进展。除了旧有的工业部门的加大以外，还增加了一些新的工业部门，而且还提高了各种材料和设备的自给率。摆脱了缺乏各种主要物资的现象，建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础，这一切的迅速发展，都是我们在一穷二白的过去情形下所一直不能想像的。
    一九五八年的大跃进，使我国的工农业总产值又增加了百分之六十五。这一跃进，完全是在党的总路线的光辉照耀之下实现的。这种人类历史上未有过的跃进成绩，充分证明了党能够领导科学技术，而且领导艺术比资产阶级的知识分子们高了不知道多少倍。对右派分子们的荒谬言论，又一次给以有力的反击。
    大跃进的成绩，不仅仅是表现在已有的物质成果上，在思想建设上也有很大的收获。由于我国过去工业比较落后，不少的人们存着有自信心不足的看法。不但是别的国家没有的我们不敢去作，就是别的国家已有的，也还是怕中国作不成。这样一来，就有些合理的或是可以作为改良和试验方向的建议，就常常在“不要轻举妄动”的说法下被否定了。在大跃进中，我们作成了很多过去认为中国作不到的事，并且还作了一些别的国家没有作到过的事。例如农业的大面积丰收，一些稀有金属的提炼等，都不是书本上所已有的。其他新的工作方法和改进设计，更是所在多有。敢想敢作必然会产生有利的结果，已经是铁一般的事实，过去那种把中国人智慧看作第二流的想法，已经大部分被铲除了。这一个思想战线上的胜利，对我们将来的发展，必然会起着重大的作用。
    虽然大跃进的成绩是不容否定的，但也有一些个别的人用怀疑的眼光来看。他们看到了个别的跃进计划未能成功，就认为这简直不得了，甚而怀疑到是否应当敢想敢作，这种看法是必需予以纠正的。对科学技术工作来说，敢想敢作，显然是应当根据已知的经验或理论，寻求解决问题的方法，然后通过试验来证实和修正原有的建议。另一方面，也可能是根据经验或理论的推断，对已有的理论产生怀疑，因而通过试验，使问题的解决有了新的方向。这种理论结合实际的作法，是党在过去一直教导我们的。如果在工作中，有些建议被证明是不对的，这也是必然会发生的事（如果一切新的建议就必然对，我们就不必再作试验了）。不能因此而不想不作。如果有某些工作的原定期限太短，因而未能如期完成任务，那也只是犯了“在战术上轻视敌人”的错误，纠正之后，必然是会取得最后的胜利的。在已取得去年的工作经验以后，我们今年将无疑地以跃进的方式，敢想敢作，完成或超额完成既定的目标。
    在周总理的报告中还提到应当有重点地开展工作，这自然是绝对必需的。但我也听到有个别同志认为，既然自己的工作不是重点，就可以不必加紧工作。也有个别的原料供给单位，因为订货方不是重点工程，虽然合同到期，库房有料也不肯供应（怕重点工程将来要）。这种作法，必然将造成偏枯现象。如果非重点的工作（在工程上，就是不属于采矿、洗煤、炼焦、轧钢、电站、排灌和机车车辆的项目）就随便放慢，则将来必然发生“头痛医头、脚痛医脚”的被动现象。这理由不必多说。可能我所听到的只是极个别的现象，但也顺便在此提一下。
    最后，作为一个旧知识分子，我想谈一下大跃进的形势对知识分子自我改造的要求。对于绝大多数的知识分子来说，跟着党走、听党的话今天已经是心悦诚服了。因此，在工作中也就在党的领导之下，取得了一些微小的成绩（个别的同志可能是取得比较大的成绩），但这些成绩，显然还是不能满足今天的需要的。在没有很好地自我改造以前，旧知识分子不但在掌握工作方针上有困难，可能在关键的问题上迷失方向。即便在具体的业务工作中，也常常发生机械唯物论的看法，延迟了工作的发展。例如在去年中，我们得到了不少工人和青年知识分子的成就，而其中的一部分，是曾经在工作过程中受到旧知识分子的非难的。这种非难的原因，有不少是由于机械地应用了旧的经验公式或数据，没有用辩证的观点，分析自己所用的局部理论是否适合于现有的客观条件，因而得到了不对的结论，妨碍了发展。另外也有的人既不说“是”也不说“不是”，对一切采取保留的态度，这同样也是由于没有掌握规律，因而对正确的意见不能予以有力的支持。由此可见，在没有彻底地同资产阶级的世界观决裂，真正掌握工人阶级的世界观以前，虽然可以工作，但工作效率将是不很高的。
    如果我们再看一看在群众路线方面的问题，则旧知识分子的缺点就更加突出了。可能有些同志认为这只是工作方法上的问题，但我们深入分析一下，就可以看到，这种工作方法是有它的阶级背景的。在旧社会中，善良的工人阶级为了争取生存，绝对不可能把自己辛苦得到的经验和知识告诉自己的敌对阶级。知识分子也是一样，不愿意把自己所知完全告诉别人。在这种情形下，自然不可能在工程技术上走群众路线来为资产阶级服务，因为资产阶级本来是没有群众基础的。在解放十年的今天，一切客观条件早已改变了，但留在我们旧知识分子头脑中的思想意识却改变得不多，只看到自己和每一个群众对比的优越性（在工程技术知识上），看不到群众集体智慧的力量。这种只见树木不见森林的机械唯物观点，只有在逐步的自我改造中才能消除，也只有到那时候，旧知识分子才能够真正转变成为工人阶级中的一员，充分发挥自己的知识，为伟大的社会主义建设很好地工作。
