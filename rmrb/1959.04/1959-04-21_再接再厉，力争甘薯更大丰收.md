Continue the Effort and Strive for a Greater Sweet Potato Harvest
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Sweet Potato Research Institute

    In 1958, sweet potatoes achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest nationwide, with unit area yield increasing by 172% compared to 1957. From Liaoning to Guangdong, from Sichuan to Fujian, high-yield fields with yields exceeding 10,000 jin per mu emerged everywhere. This is a fruitful result under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction.

    This year is the decisive year of the Second Five-Year Plan. Sweet potatoes have great potential for increased production and strong resistance to adversity, making them the most reliable aspect of food crops. To fulfill and overfulfill the national grain production increase task for 1959, we must build on last year's foundation, continue our efforts, and strive for a greater sweet potato harvest.

    Compared to 1958, this year's situation is even more favorable for sweet potato production. First, through last year's practice, from leaders to the masses, rich experience has been gained in sweet potato production. Especially after the people's communes were established, striving for excellence has become the guiding principle of the broad masses of working people. Suqian and Ganyu counties in Jiangsu Province completed sweet potato soil turning and fertilizer delivery work as early as February, increasing the amount of seed retained three to four times compared to previous years, and possessing thousands of technicians familiar with heating seedling cultivation and cultivation techniques. These are the basic guarantees for achieving a greater sweet potato harvest.

    Currently, for the vast majority of regions across the country, it is the beginning of the sweet potato production season. As the saying goes, "A careful beginning yields double the results." Based on some experiences from last year, the following questions are proposed for everyone's discussion and research.

    Heating Seedling Cultivation

    Except for the southern regions of Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan provinces, where sweet potatoes can be planted year-round, sweet potatoes in the remaining regions can basically be divided into two types: one is planted when the temperature is suitable (generally called spring sweet potatoes); the other is restricted by the stubble and must be planted after the previous crop is harvested (generally called summer or autumn sweet potatoes). For summer or autumn sweet potatoes, heating seedling cultivation is not necessarily required, but spring sweet potatoes must be heated seedling cultivation (using fermentation materials or heated beds). Because sweet potatoes are perennial plants, sweet potato tubers do not have a clear maturity period. The longer the growing period, the higher the yield. Also, because it is a thermophilic plant, the growing period is limited in general areas. The method of heating seedling cultivation is to artificially create high-temperature conditions, cultivate seedlings in advance, and free up more time for them to grow in the field, to increase tuber yield. This is a means of overcoming and utilizing nature.

    Therefore, there is no basis for doubting the superiority of heating seedling cultivation. Some people think that heating seedling cultivation is necessary in the north, but not necessary in the south. In fact, except for overwintering sweet potato areas, spring sweet potatoes should all be heated seedling cultivation. For example, in Fuqing and Fuzhou areas of Fujian Province, the temperature is relatively high, and planting can generally be done in early April, but if heating seedling cultivation is not used, sweet potato seedlings will not grow until the end of May, reducing the field growing period and reducing yield.

    The practice in 1958 proved that the heating seedling cultivation bed area must be adapted to the spring sweet potato area. If the seedbed area is not enough, the phenomenon of planting spring sweet potatoes in summer will occur. The seedbed area required per mu of spring sweet potatoes varies depending on variety characteristics, planting density, bed temperature, seedbed management, and cutting density. According to the Sweet Potato Research Institute's survey of more than 3,000 hotbeds, the amount of seed sown in mid-March (Victory No. 100) in a 40-square-foot glass fermentation material hotbed is 160 jin, and the temperature is maintained between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius (the appropriate temperature is about 32 degrees Celsius in the initial stage; after emergence, maintain it at about 28 degrees Celsius). 800 to 1,000 seedlings are cut on April 20, 1,000 to 1,200 seedlings are cut on April 30, and 1,000 to 1,200 seedlings are cut on May 10, for a total of 2,800 to 3,400 seedlings in three cuttings. This figure can be used as a reference for seedling cultivation.

    Deep Plowing and Fertilization

    Through last year's practice, it can be seen that the yield increase effect of deep plowing is very obvious, especially when plowing in winter, the effect is even better. How deep should the land for planting sweet potatoes be plowed? According to the survey results of Suqian, Ganyu, and Yixing counties in Jiangsu Province, deep plowing of 1.5 chi can increase yield by up to 160.2% compared to general plowing, while there is no significant difference in yield between deep plowing of 3 chi and deep plowing of 1.5 chi; from our own experimental results, increasing the plowing depth from 0.5 chi to 0.8 chi, 1.2 chi, and 1.5 chi, the yields increased by 40.1%, 47.7%, and 52.5% respectively. Based on these results, under the current cultivation conditions, a plowing depth of 1 chi to 1.5 chi is appropriate.

    The amount of fertilizer, the type of fertilizer, and the method of application all directly affect sweet potato yield. In 1958, we found in a survey of Yixing, Ganyu, and Suqian counties in Jiangsu that high-yield fields with yields exceeding 10,000 jin per mu applied 80,000 to 200,000 jin of coarse fertilizer (wall soil, pond mud, etc.) and 10,000 to 50,000 jin of compost and manure fertilizer per mu, indicating that to obtain high yield, more fertilizer must be applied. The experience of farmers in the Huaibei area is that 1 jin of manure fertilizer yields 1 jin of sweet potatoes. The ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is about 2:1:3. The types of fertilizer include pond mud, wall soil, compost, garbage, pig and cattle manure, ash, green manure, and human and animal excrement. Some high-yield fields also used sea fertilizer. In terms of fertilization methods, basal fertilizer generally accounts for about 90%. The most important thing is that these farm fertilizers must be weathered and decomposed before use (preferably applied to the field in winter). The experimental results of Xiaodian Commune in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, showed that applying unfermented pond mud reduced yield by 22.4% compared to not applying fertilizer.

    To solve the problem of fertilizer sources, we believe that planting green manure is a good method. The sweet potato yield in Zhoushan area of Zhejiang Province has been very high over the years, which is inseparable from the planting of alfalfa.

    High Ridge Double Row Dense Planting

    Sweet potatoes often produce very large tubers when planted individually or sparsely, which often creates the illusion that sweet potatoes do not need to be densely planted. The experience of Hunan Province shows that to obtain a bumper harvest, the number of tubers must be considered in addition to the size of the tubers. The East China Agricultural Science Institute once observed that there was no difference in the unit area weight of stems and leaves between 3,700 plants per mu with dense planting and 1,850 plants per mu with sparse planting, but the number of tubers per unit area increased by one time, and the weight of tubers increased by 10%. This experiment shows that dense planting yields higher than sparse planting.

    In addition to increasing the number of plants per mu, the method of increasing the number of tubers per mu can also be done by horizontal cutting. Last year's experimental results showed that horizontal cutting increased the average number of tubers per plant by three and increased yield by 11.3% compared to direct cutting; from the observation results of five communes in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, horizontal cutting increased yield by 11%-41% compared to direct cutting, with an average increase of 19.2%.

    The degree of dense planting and the method of dense planting are the key issues in dense planting. Huan Dun Commune in Ganyu County, Jiangsu Province, had a high-yield field with a yield of more than 21,000 jin per mu, with more than 3,100 plants per mu. Another high-yield field in the commune with a yield of more than 15,000 jin per mu had more than 3,500 plants per mu; a high-yield field in Yangbei Commune in Suqian with a yield of 10,200 jin per mu had more than 3,700 plants per mu. It seems that under conditions of long growing period and sufficient fertilization, 3,000 to 4,000 plants per mu is more appropriate.

    The experimental results of Xiaodian Commune in Suqian show that under general fertilization conditions, increasing summer sweet potatoes from 3,000 plants per mu to 6,000 plants per mu increased yield by 12.9%, while planting 8,000 plants per mu reduced yield by 4% compared to planting 3,000 plants per mu. Our experimental results showed that increasing from 2,000 plants per mu to 5,000 plants per mu increased yield by 34%. According to the experimental results of ten communes in Suqian County, under general fertilization conditions, regardless of spring or summer sweet potatoes, planting 4,000 plants per mu generally increased yield compared to planting more than 2,000 plants per mu. Therefore, for general fields, there should be no less than 4,000 plants per mu, and in areas similar to Suqian, the maximum should not exceed 6,000 plants per mu.

    From the perspective of dense planting methods, high ridge double row dense planting is a better method. The three high-yield fields in Ganyu and Suqian counties mentioned above all adopted this method. In theory, this method has good drainage because the ridges are made higher; it also has good moisture retention because the ridges are made wider; at the same time, it has good ventilation because planting is done on both sides of the ridges, which is suitable for the characteristic of tubers liking air. Last year, many places tried using three rows, four rows, or more per ridge, but the tubers in the inner rows grew smaller, mainly due to the poor ventilation.

    The advantage of high ridge double row dense planting is that it meets the requirement of density with sparseness. Our test proved that planting the same 5,000 plants per mu, 2 chi × 0.6 chi single row reduced yield by 5% compared to 3 chi × 0.8 chi double row. This shows that excessively reducing the plant spacing will cause poor ventilation and light transmission, poor plant growth, and reduce yield.

    Select Good Varieties and Cultivate Strong Seedlings

    On the issue of sweet potato varieties, the urgent need to be solved is the issue of good variety breeding. In recent years, several new varieties bred domestically, such as North China 117, Beijing 553, 51-16, 51-93, etc., have been confirmed in many areas to be better than Victory No. 100. If a good variety breeding system can be established, not only can good varieties be popularized in a short period of time, but also the phenomenon of degradation of existing varieties can be solved.

    In sweet potato good variety breeding, we believe that giving seed retention fields good cultivation conditions and continuous selection every year is definitely beneficial. The experience of the masses in Hunan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, and the experiments of the East China Agricultural Science Institute, all consistently prove that summer sweet potato seed retention is better than spring sweet potato seed retention; the experiments of the East China Agricultural Science Institute also prove that the average single plant weight of the 51-93 variety increased by 33% after two consecutive years of mixed selection compared to the unselected variety, and the stem and leaf decline period was delayed.

    Shallow Soil Cultivation and Multiple Cultivation

    The roots of sweet potatoes like sufficient air in the soil. Violating this characteristic will affect tuber formation and reduce the tuber swelling speed. Last year, some areas cultivated the ridge soil very thickly, and some even filled two ridges with soil to form one ridge, which did not receive good results. This is mainly because it affects the air permeability of the soil, and the same is true for the reason that cutting too deep does not form tubers and that excessive rain affects the tuber swelling speed.

    Soil cultivation should be combined with mid-cultivation. Mid-cultivation can enable sweet potatoes to form and increase the number of tubers early in an excellent environment with appropriate air and moisture, large soil temperature changes, and concentrated fertilizer.

    Disease Prevention

    Sweet potatoes have many diseases. Here, we will only talk about black spot disease and toxin disease.

    Black spot disease is extremely harmful in many areas. We have investigated in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, and the phenomenon of rotten seeds and rotten seedlings in the seedbed is inseparable from this disease. In addition to directly causing yield reduction (including spoilage in the field and in storage), this disease also indirectly affects early planting and dense planting. According to our survey results in several counties in northern Jiangsu in 1958, to completely eliminate this disease, it is necessary to implement comprehensive prevention methods, which must pay attention to high cutting seedlings and prevent other transmission routes. It is best to combine with good variety breeding fields and implement a series of disease prevention measures to eliminate the disease.

    Toxin disease occurs particularly seriously in the Victory No. 100 and 51-93 varieties. Its harmfulness is generally not noticed, especially when the symptoms are invisible under high temperature conditions. In fact, this disease can seriously reduce sweet potato yield. According to the experimental results of the former North China Agricultural Science Institute, it can reduce yield by 20%-40%. At present, in addition to selecting healthy seedlings to prevent this disease, it is necessary to combine with good variety breeding fields, select disease-free seedlings, and select tubers from disease-free plants for seed at harvest to achieve disease prevention effects.

    再接再厉，力争甘薯更大丰收
    中国农业科学院甘薯研究所
    1958年在全国范围内甘薯获得空前大丰收，单位面积产量比1957年增加172％。从辽宁到广东，从四川到福建，到处都涌现亩产万斤以上的丰产田，这是在社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下所结出的硕果。
    今年是第二个五年计划决战的一年。甘薯增产潜力大，抗逆性强，是粮食作物中最可靠的一个方面军，为完成和超额完成1959年国家粮食增产任务，必须在去年的基础上，再接再厉，力争甘薯更大丰收。
    今年的情况比起1958年，对甘薯生产是更加有利的，首先是通过去年的实践，从领导到群众，在甘薯生产上都取得了丰富的经验。尤其是人民公社化以后，鼓干劲、争上游已成为广大劳动人民行动的准则。江苏宿迁、赣榆等县早在2月份就完成甘薯翻土和送肥工作，留种量比往年增加三至四倍，并且拥有数以千计熟悉加温育苗和栽培的技术员，这些都是取得甘薯更大丰收的基本保证。
  目前，就全国绝大部分地区说，正是甘薯生产季节开始的时候，常言说得好：“慎始者功倍半”。仅据去年的一些经验提出以下几个问题，以供大家讨论研究。
    加温育苗
    我国除了福建、广东和台湾三省南部地区，可常年种植甘薯外，其余地区的甘薯基本上可分为两种类型：一种是温度适宜时就开始扦插（一般叫春薯）；另一种是受茬口限制，必须等前茬收获后才能扦插（一般叫夏薯或秋薯）。对于夏薯或秋薯说，不一定要进行加温育苗，但春薯就必须进行加温育苗（用酿热物或火炕），因为甘薯是多年生植物，薯块没有明显的成熟期，生长期愈长，产量也愈高，又因为它是喜温植物，在一般地区生长期是有一定限制的。加温育苗的办法就是人工创造高温条件，提前育出薯苗，腾出更多时间，让它在大田生长，以提高薯块产量，这是克服和利用自然的一种手段。
    所以，怀疑加温育苗的优越性是没有任何根据的，有人以为在北方要进行加温育苗，在南方可以不必采用，事实除越冬薯地区外，春薯都应该进行加温育苗。如福建省福清和福州一带，气温是较高的，一般在4月上旬就可以栽插，但如果不利用加温育苗，就要到5月底才能长出薯苗，缩减了大田生长期，减少产量。
    1958年实践证明，加温育苗的苗床面积，必须和春薯面积相适应；如果苗床面积不够，就会发生春薯夏栽的现象。每亩春薯所需的苗床面积因品种特性、排种的稀密、床温的高低、苗床管理的好坏以及扦插密度等而有出入。根据甘薯研究所调查三千多个温床结果，每四十平方尺的玻璃酿热物温床，3月中旬播种（胜利百号）量一百六十斤，温度保持在摄氏二十五至三十度（适当的温度是，初期应该在摄氏三十二度左右；出苗后保持在摄氏二十八度左右）之间，4月20日剪苗八百到一千株，4月30日剪苗一千至一千二百株，5月10日剪苗一千至一千二百株，三次共剪苗二千八百至三千四百株。这个数字可供育苗时参考。
    深翻土地和施肥
    通过去年实践，可以看出深翻土的增产效果是十分明显的，尤其在冬季翻，效果更好。种甘薯的土地应该翻多深？从江苏宿迁、赣榆、宜兴等县调查结果看，深翻一尺半的比一般翻耕的最高能增产160.2％，而深翻三尺和深翻一尺半的产量没有明显区别；从我们自己作的试验结果看，翻土深度从半尺增至八寸、一尺二寸、一尺半，产量分别增加40.1％、47.7％和52.5％。根据这些结果看来，在目前的栽培条件下，翻土深度以一尺到一尺半为宜。
    施肥量和施肥种类以及使用方法都直接影响甘薯产量。1958年我们在江苏宜兴、赣榆、宿迁等三县调查发现，万斤以上的丰产田，每亩施粗肥（墙土、塘泥等）达到八万至二十万斤，堆、厩肥达到一万至五万斤，说明要得到高产必须多施肥。淮北地区农民的经验是一斤厩肥、一斤薯，氮、磷、钾三要素的比例约为二比一比三，肥料的种类有塘泥、墙头土、堆肥、垃圾、猪、牛圈肥、草木灰、绿肥、人粪尿等，一些丰产田还使用了海肥。在施肥方法上，基肥比重一般占90％左右，最重要的是这些农家肥料都必须经过风化腐熟后才能使用（最好在冬季施入田中）。江苏宿迁县晓店公社试验结果，施用没有腐熟的塘泥，比未施肥的反减产22.4％。
    解决肥源问题，我们认为栽种绿肥是个好办法，浙江舟山一带历年甘薯产量都很高，和种植黄花苜蓿是分不开的。
    高垄双行密植
    甘薯在单栽或稀植的情况下，经常能结出很大的薯块，这样往往造成一种错觉，以为甘薯不必密植。湖南省的经验说明，要得到丰产，在考虑薯块大小的基础上，还必须考虑到薯块的多少。华东农业科学研究所曾观察，每亩密植三千七百株比每亩稀植一千八百五十株的单位面积茎叶重量没有分别，单位面积薯块数则增加一倍，而薯块重量增加10％。这个试验说明密植比稀植产量要高。
    增加每亩薯块数的方法，除用增加每亩株数外，还可以用水平扦插的办法。去年我们试验的结果，水平插比直插平均单株结薯数增加三个，产量增加11.3％；从江苏宿迁县五个公社观察结果，水平插比直插增产11％—41％，平均增产19.2％。
    密植程度和密植方式是密植中的关键问题。江苏干榆县欢墩公社有一块亩产二万一千多斤的丰产田，每亩为三千一百多株，该社另一块亩产一万五千多斤的丰产田，每亩为三千五百多株；宿迁洋北公社一块亩产一万零二百斤的丰产田，每亩为三千七百多株。看来在生长期长、施足肥的情况下，每亩株数以三千至四千株较合适。
    宿迁晓店公社试验结果证明：在一般施肥情况下，夏薯每亩从三千株增至六千株，增产12.9％，而每亩栽八千株比每亩栽三千株的减产4％。我们试验结果，每亩从二千株增至五千株，增产34％。又据宿迁县十个公社的试验结果：在一般施肥情况下，不拘春、夏薯，每亩栽四千株的一般比每亩栽二千多株的增产。因此，就一般田说，每亩不应低于四千株，而在和宿迁类似的地区，每亩最高不必超过六千株。
    从密植方式看，高垄双行密植是较好的一种方式，前面提到的干榆和宿迁县的三块丰产田都是采取这种方式的。从道理上说，这种方式由于垄子做得较高，所以排水好；又由于垄子做得较宽，所以保墒也较好；同时，由于栽植在垄子的两边，所以通气较好，适合于薯块喜欢空气这一特点。去年曾有好多地方试用一垄三行、四行或更多的，结果里行薯块长得较小，主要是通气性较差的关系。
    高垄双行密植的好处，还在于符合密中有稀这一要求。我们的试验证明，每亩同样栽五千株，2尺×0.6尺单行的比3尺×0.8尺双行的减产5％。这说明，过于缩小株距，会使通风透光不良，植株生长不好，减低产量。
    选用良种　培育壮秧
    在甘薯品种问题上，迫切需要解决的是良种繁育问题。近年来，国内选育的几个新品种如华北117、北京553、51—16、51—93等，在不少地区已肯定这些品种比胜利百号好。如果能建立一套良种繁育制度，不但能在短期内普及良种，而且能解决现有品种退化的现象。
    在甘薯良种繁育上，我们认为应该给留种田以好的栽培条件和每年不断选择，这肯定是有好处的。湖南、江苏、浙江群众的经验和华东农业科学研究所的试验，都一致证明夏薯留种比春薯好；华东农业科学研究所试验还证明51—93品种经连续两年混合选择，比未选择的平均单株重增加33％，并且茎叶衰退期延迟。
    浅培土　多中耕
    甘薯的块根欢喜土壤中有足够的空气，违反了这个特点，就会影响结薯和减低薯块膨大速度。去年有些地区，把垄土培得很厚，还有把两垄用土填并成一垄的，都没有收到好效果，这主要是因为影响土壤透气性的关系，和因扦插过深不结薯块以及多雨影响薯块膨大速度是同样道理。
    培土应结合中耕进行。中耕能使甘薯在空气水分适量、地温变异大、肥分集中的优良环境下，早结和多结薯块。
    防治病害
    甘薯的病害很多，这里只谈谈黑斑病和毒素病问题。
    黑斑病在不少地区为害极为严重，我们曾在浙江、江苏、安徽几省调查，苗床里烂种烂苗现象都和这种病害分不开，这种病除直接造成减产（包括大田和贮藏中腐烂），还间接影响到早栽和密植。据我们1958年在苏北几个县调查结果，要彻底肃清这个病害，必须贯彻综合防治的办法，既要注意高剪苗，还要杜绝其它传染途径，最好能结合良种繁育田，贯彻一系列的防病措施，就可以将病害消灭。
    毒素病在胜利百号、51—93两个品种上发生得特别严重，它的为害性一般不被注意，特别在高温情况下病征就看不到了。事实上，这种病害可以使甘薯严重减产。据前华北农业科学研究所试验结果，它能减产20％—40％。目前防治这种病害除选用健苗外，还应结合良种繁育田，选用无病的苗，收获时选用无病植株上的薯块做种，可以收到防病效果。
