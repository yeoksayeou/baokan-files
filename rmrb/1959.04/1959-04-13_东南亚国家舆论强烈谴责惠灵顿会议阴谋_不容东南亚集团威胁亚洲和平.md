　　Southeast Asian Countries' Public Opinion Strongly Condemns Wellington Conference Conspiracy
　　Southeast Asia Bloc Must Not Threaten Asian Peace
　　Vietnamese "People's Daily" Points Out
　　Southeast Asia Bloc's Spearhead Points at Peace-Loving Countries
　　U.S. Imperialism's Frenzied Activities Are a Sign of Weakness
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 12th: The "People's Daily" published a commentary today pointing out that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council's Wellington Conference, which concluded on April 10th, once again exposed the aggressive nature of this bloc.
    The commentary pointed out that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, controlled by U.S. imperialism, has been continuously engaged in activities that undermine peace and the national independence of Southeast Asian countries since its establishment.
    The commentary exposed in detail the conspiracies plotted at the Wellington Conference to carry out military provocations and subversive activities. The commentary pointed out that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is stepping up its efforts to direct its aggressive spearhead at the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and other peace-loving countries in Asia. The commentary said that this situation shows that U.S. imperialism and its vassals are constantly trying every possible means to create tension around the world; U.S. imperialism is clearly still unwilling to abandon its "brink of war" policy.
    The commentary pointed out that such frenzied activities by U.S. imperialism and its bloc can only prove that they are weak, not strong.

　　The United States Wants to Lock Its Asian Partners Inside
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 11th: Indian newspapers have condemned the recent Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting in Wellington for plotting aggressive conspiracies.
    The political and economic magazine "India" said that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is intensifying its military activities in Asia. The magazine wrote: "The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is increasingly becoming a livestock pen, and the colonialists and the main leaders of this bloc are attempting to lock inside the Southeast Asian countries that are already under their control." The magazine said that "the policies of the leading countries of the military bloc, especially the policies of the United States, pose a serious danger to other Southeast Asian countries, especially India."
    The "Leader" published an editorial on April 10th saying that concluding such military alliances in the name of opposing communism "is not only of no benefit to Asian countries, but also causes them great harm." The newspaper criticized the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization for discussing the Kashmir issue and condemned the United States' policy of using Asians to fight Asians.
    The "Assam Tribune" published an editorial on April 9th expressing support for the Soviet Union's accusation against this aggressive bloc of being defensive in name but offensive in purpose. The newspaper said that the Soviet Union "has completely exposed the conspiracy of the United States to further escalate tensions in Asia." The newspaper accused the United States of "bringing the horror of nuclear war to Asian soil."

    The resolution pointed out that the formation of such a force only shows that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries intend to further interfere in the internal affairs of countries in the Southeast Asian region and threaten the peace of this part of the world.
    The resolution demanded constant attention to the activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states that threaten world peace.
　　Indonesian "Eastern Star" Points Out
　　Wellington Conference Is a Threat to Indonesia
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Indonesian "Eastern Star" recently published an editorial pointing out that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's Wellington Conference and the bloc's military exercises are a threat to Indonesia.
    The editorial, while condemning the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's naval exercises held east of Malaya, said that it is not impossible for the military bloc's warships to provocatively violate Indonesian territorial waters, because the bloc has always opposed the Indonesian government's decision to extend its territorial waters to twelve nautical miles.
    The newspaper believes that the Australian military advisor to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Dowling, claimed that he intended to pull Indonesia into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and these words were not accidental.
　　Razak Says Without the Consent of the Malayan Government
　　Southeast Asia Bloc Cannot Use Malaya as a Base
    Xinhua News Agency, April 11th, Kuala Lumpur Dispatch: The acting Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of the Federation of Malaya, Razak, reiterated today that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization cannot use Malaya as its base without obtaining the consent of the government of the Federation of Malaya.
    Razak made the above remarks in response to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council's Wellington Conference plotting to establish a mobile aggression force for this military bloc. According to the plan of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting, the British Commonwealth forces in Malaya will be used to form this mobile aggression force. The British Commonwealth forces stationed in Malaya have been used to suppress the Malayan National Liberation Army.
    Razak said that according to the British-Malayan military agreement, without Malaya's consent, the Commonwealth forces cannot use their bases in Malaya to fight against foreign countries. He said, "Under no circumstances will we change such provisions."

　　东南亚国家舆论强烈谴责惠灵顿会议阴谋
　　不容东南亚集团威胁亚洲和平
　　越南“人民报”指出
　　东南亚集团矛头指向爱好和平国家
　　美帝国主义的疯狂活动是脆弱表现
    新华社河内12日电　“人民报”今天发表评论指出，在4月10日结束的东南亚条约组织理事会惠灵顿会议再次暴露了这个集团的侵略性质。
    评论指出，由美帝国主义控制的东南亚条约组织自从成立以来，不断进行破坏和平和东南亚各国的民族独立的活动。
    评论详细揭露了惠灵顿会议所策划的进行军事挑衅和颠覆活动的阴谋。评论指出，东南亚条约组织正在加紧把它的侵略矛头指向越南民主共和国、中国和其他亚洲爱好和平的国家。评论说，这种情况表明，美帝国主义及其附庸们不断千方百计地在世界各地制造紧张局势；美帝国主义显然仍不甘心放弃它的“战争边缘”政策。
    评论指出，美帝国主义和它的集团的这种疯狂活动只能证明它们是脆弱的，而不是强大的。
　　印度舆论谴责惠灵顿会议
　　东南亚集团正日益成为牲畜栏
　　美国想把它的亚洲伙伴关进去
    新华社新德里11日电　印度报纸谴责最近在惠灵顿举行的东南亚条约组织理事会会议策划侵略阴谋。
    政治和经济杂志“印度”说，东南亚条约组织正在亚洲加紧它的军事活动。这家杂志写道：“东南亚条约组织正在日益成为一个牲畜栏，殖民主义者和这个集团的主要头领，企图把已经处在他们控制下的东南亚国家关在里面。”这家杂志说，“军事集团的领导国家的政策，首先是美国的政策，对东南亚其他国家，特别是对印度造成了严重的危险。”
    “领袖报”10日发表社论说，以反对共产主义为名缔结这种军事联盟，“不仅对亚洲国家没有什么好处，反而对它们造成很大的害处。”这家报纸批评东南亚条约组织讨论克什米尔问题，并且谴责美国的利用亚洲人打亚洲人的政策。
    “阿萨姆论坛报”4月9日发表的社论表示支持苏联对这个侵略集团提出的以防御为名以进攻为目的的指责。这家报纸说，苏联“已经完全揭穿了美国企图在亚洲进一步加剧紧张局势的阴谋。”这家报纸指责美国“把核战争的恐怖带到亚洲土地上。”
    “甘露市场报”也批评东南亚条约组织是“对和平的潜在威胁”。
　　缅甸民族团结阵线揭露
　　东南亚集团策划组织机动侵略军
　　企图进一步干涉东南亚各国内政
    新华社仰光12日电　缅甸民族团结阵线主席团在11日举行的会议上通过了一项决议，强烈谴责东南亚条约组织理事会会议策划组织一支机动侵略部队的阴谋。
    决议指出，组成这样的一支部队只是表明，东南亚条约组织国家打算进一步干涉东南亚地区各国的内政，并且威胁世界的这个部分的和平。
    决议要求经常注意东南亚条约组织成员国的威胁世界和平的活动。
　　印度尼西亚“东星报”指出
　　惠灵顿会议是对印度尼西亚的威胁
    据新华社讯　印度尼西亚“东星报”最近发表社论指出，东南亚条约组织惠灵顿会议以及这个集团的军事演习——是对印度尼西亚的威胁。
    社论在谴责东南亚条约组织在马来亚东面举行的海军演习时说，这个军事集团的军舰挑衅性地侵犯印度尼西亚的领海，不是不可能的。因为这个集团一直反对印度尼西亚政府把领海扩大到十二海里的决定。
    这家报纸认为，东南亚条约组织的澳大利亚军事顾问陶林声称，他打算把印度尼西亚拉入东南亚条约组织，这番话不是偶然的。
　　拉扎克说未得马来亚政府同意
　　东南亚集团不能把马来亚作为基地
    新华社11日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚联合邦代理总理兼国防部长拉扎克今天重申，在没有获得马来亚联合邦政府的同意以前，东南亚条约组织不能把马来亚作为它的基地。
    拉扎克是针对东南亚条约组织理事会惠灵顿会议策划建立这个军事集团的机动侵略部队这件事发表上述谈话的。根据东南亚条约组织理事会会议的计划，在马来亚的英联邦军队将被用来组成这支机动侵略部队。驻在马来亚的英联邦军队一直被用来镇压马来亚民族解放军。
    拉扎克说，根据英国——马来亚军事协定，在没有取得马来亚的同意以前，英联邦的军队不能使用它们在马来亚的基地来同外国作战。他说，“在任何情况下，我们都不会改变这样的一些条款。”
