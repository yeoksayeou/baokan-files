    Lenin Participates in Communist Voluntary Saturday Labor
    --Recollections of People Who Participated in Voluntary Saturday Labor with Lenin
    By Our Correspondent Li Nan
    May 1, 1920, was a sunny and joyful day in Moscow. The great initiative – Communist Voluntary Saturday Labor – had just completed its first anniversary. To commemorate and develop this significant movement, this day was declared the first All-Russian Voluntary Labor Day. Instead of resting and celebrating, the people of all Soviet Russia welcomed this festival of working people with labor.
    On this day, the responsible comrades of the Central Committee at that time also fully participated in physical labor as ordinary workers, setting an example. Kalinin went to work beside a lathe at the Mikhelson factory, Dzerzhinsky went to work on the Moscow-Kazan railway line, and Lenin participated in voluntary labor cleaning the Kremlin.
    Nearly forty years have passed. Now, as the spring of comprehensive communist construction in the Soviet Union is spreading, and the movement of communist labor teams is flourishing, people cannot help but recall the dedicated examples of the older generation of Soviet Communist Party members and the working class in those difficult circumstances. People want to recall the great Lenin, who first supported and personally participated in this movement.
    At the Veterans Association, I met Solodov and Antonov, who had participated in this voluntary Saturday labor with Lenin. Forty years ago, they were young soldiers at the Kremlin Military School, and now they have both retired from their work. With infinite respect and affection, they talked about that unforgettable era and those moving scenes that would never fade.
    The Kremlin was sunny and picturesque, but in some places, it still appeared somewhat disorganized. During the October Revolution, the White Guards stubbornly defended their positions from high ground; the Kremlin was only transferred to the people after fierce fighting. The traces of war were everywhere. Cleaning up every corner of the Kremlin and removing the remaining fortifications, barbed wire, bricks, and wood blocks became one of the tasks of the first All-Russian Voluntary Saturday Labor.
    At nine o'clock in the morning, eight or nine hundred students from the military school were lined up in the Kremlin Square. Military flags were waving, and military music was loud and clear. At this time, everyone did not know that Lenin was coming to participate in the labor. Lenin walked out of the People's Committee building and quickly went to the front of the line on the square. Lenin was wearing simple dark blue clothes, high-topped shoes, and a peaked cap. Borisov, the person in charge of the military school, reported to Lenin and asked, "Comrade Lenin, are you here to participate in voluntary Saturday labor with us?" Lenin replied, "That's right." Everyone cheered.
    The teams immediately divided into groups and participated in labor on Ivanovskaya Square. Lenin worked alongside everyone, energetic and sweating profusely, carrying scattered wood blocks. Lenin always picked up the big and heavy ones, and when he was with others, he always stood on the heavy end. This situation naturally made everyone uneasy, so they advised him not to do this. Everyone said to him: Comrade Lenin, you are old, and your body has been injured. We are all strong and young. Lenin seemed to feel wronged by this persuasion. He replied: "Since I am older and you are younger, then you should listen to the elders and not disobey them."
    Lenin worked with a military school student named Belmiyakov, who was a very strong and sturdy young man, always rushing to carry the heaviest end. When Lenin saw this, he immediately smiled and told him that he shouldn't do that. After saying that, Lenin lifted the heavy end himself.
    During the labor, Borisov asked Lenin to take a photo, but Lenin did not agree. This also shows how modest Lenin was. The moving scene of Lenin participating in this voluntary Saturday labor was therefore not preserved. It was not until after Lenin's death that it was discovered that someone had taken a picture at the time, but because it was taken secretly when Lenin was not paying attention, the picture was very dark and only Lenin's profile was captured.
    When Lenin worked with everyone, he constantly talked and laughed with everyone, often asking those around him if they felt too tired, and quickly made everyone feel at ease. When he carried the wood blocks and returned empty-handed, he saw two people carrying a six-meter-long wood block. He immediately stood in the middle to help carry it. After putting it down, Lenin asked the two comrades if they felt lighter. They replied that it was much lighter with one more person. Lenin smiled and said that one person felt heavy, two people were lighter, and three people were even lighter. This is called the power of the collective.
    During the break, Lenin sat with everyone on a pile of wood to rest, asking about everyone's life and family situation. When talking about the voluntary Saturday labor movement, Lenin told everyone that we will build our socialist country in this way. Through the voluntary Saturday labor movement, we will transition to communist labor.
    During the break, Lenin saw that many people were smoking, so he told everyone that tobacco is poisonous and smoking is harmful to health. When everyone asked Lenin if he had ever smoked, Lenin said that he had smoked when he was young, but then he decided not to smoke and never smoked again.
    The labor became heavier and heavier. Everyone was afraid that Lenin was too tired and advised him to go back earlier. Everyone said that in the People's Committee, there were more important things than physical labor waiting for him to deal with, and that even if one person was missing here, the work could still be completed. Lenin resolutely refused to leave early. He said that regardless of their position, everyone must participate in voluntary Saturday labor. Today, this work is the most important work.
    Lenin worked with everyone until the end. He only left when someone came to invite him to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony for the Marx and Engels monument, which was only a few minutes before the end of work. Lenin said goodbye to the soldiers of the military school and congratulated them on participating in this meaningful first All-Russian Voluntary Saturday Labor.
    In this way, forty years ago, Lenin not only pointed out the great significance of the voluntary Saturday labor movement, but also personally participated in this movement, setting an example of loving labor and abiding by discipline. Forty years later, today, as the Soviet Union enters the comprehensive development of communist construction, on the occasion of commemorating the 89th anniversary of Lenin's birth, Lenin's prophecy about communist labor has been realized.

    列宁参加共产主义义务星期六劳动
    ——和列宁一道参加义务星期六劳动的人的回忆
    本报记者　李楠
    1920年5月1日，在莫斯科是个晴阳灿烂，喜气洋洋的日子。伟大的创举——共产主义义务星期六劳动诞生刚刚满了第一周年。为了纪念和发展这一有重大意义的运动，这一天被宣布成立第一个全俄义务劳动日。代替休息和庆祝，全苏维埃俄罗斯的人民用劳动来迎接这个劳动人民的佳节。
    这一天，当时中央的负责同志们也完全以普通劳动者的身份，以身作则参加体力劳动。加里宁到米哈尔松工厂的车床旁边去工作，捷尔任斯基到莫斯科—喀山铁路线上去工作，列宁参加了清扫克里姆林的义务劳动。
    将近四十年的时间过去了。现在当苏联共产主义全面建设的春光弥漫，共产主义劳动队的运动蓬勃开展的时候，人们不禁要回想起，在当年艰苦的环境下，老一代的苏联共产党员和工人阶级的献身榜样。人们更要想起首先支持并且亲身参加了这个运动的伟大的列宁。
    在退伍军人协会里，我遇见了曾和列宁一起参加这个义务星期六的索洛多夫和安东诺夫两人，他们四十年前是克里姆林军事学校的青年战士，而今都已经从工作岗位上退休了。他们带着无限崇敬和亲切的心情谈起那个永远不会使人遗忘的年代，永远不会磨灭的动人的场面。
    克里姆林宫阳光明媚，景色宜人，但是在有些地方却还显得有些零乱无序。十月革命时节，白卫军居高固守，负隅顽抗；克里姆林宫经过剧烈战斗，才转到人民手中。战争的遗迹累累皆是。把克里姆林宫各个角落整理清洁，清除遗留下来的防御工事、铁丝网、砖头、木块就成为第一个全俄义务星期六中的一个任务。
    早上九点钟，克里姆林宫的广场上排列着军事学校的学生八、九百人。军旗招展，军乐嘹亮。这时大家还不知道列宁要来参加劳动。列宁从人民委员会的大厦中走了出来，迅速走到广场上队伍的前面。列宁穿着简便的暗蓝色服装，半统鞋，鸭舌帽。军校的负责人鲍利索夫向列宁作了报告以后问道：“列宁同志，你是来和我们一道参加义务星期六劳动吗？”列宁回答说：“正是这样。”大家都欢呼起来。
    队伍立刻分成小组在伊凡诺夫广场上参加劳动。列宁和大家一道，精神抖擞，满头流汗，搬运散乱的木块。列宁总是捡大的重的，和别人一道时，也是站在沉重的一端。这种情况，自然使大家感到不安，于是劝他不要这样。大伙儿对他说：列宁同志，你岁数大了，而且身体还受过伤，我们都身强力壮，岁数年轻。列宁对这种劝说，像是受到一种委曲，他这样回答说：“既然我年长，你们年轻，那么你们就听从长者，不要违反他。”
    列宁和一个叫别尔米雅科夫的军校学生一起搭伴搬运木块，后者是个身体非常结实健壮的青年人，他总是抢着肩负最粗重的一头。列宁看到这种情况，立刻笑着和他说不应该这样。说了之后，列宁就把重的一头抬了起来。
    在劳动进行中，鲍利索夫要求列宁照相，但是列宁不同意。这点也表现出列宁是如何的谦逊。列宁参加这个义务星期六的动人场面因此未能保存下来。直到列宁逝世以后，才发现当时有人拍了一张，不过因为是暗中趁列宁不注意时拍摄的，所以画面很暗，而且只照到了列宁的侧面。
    列宁和大家一块劳动时，不断和大家一块谈笑，常常询问旁人是否感觉太累，很快就使大家一点也不感到拘束。他抬了木块，空着手回来时，看见有两个人抬着一块六公尺长的木块，他立刻站在中间帮助抬。放好以后，列宁问这两个同志是否觉得轻一些。他们回答，多一个人要轻得多。列宁笑着说，一个人感到沉重，两个人就较轻便，三个人就更轻便一些。这就叫做集体的力量。
    到了歇息时间，列宁和大家一道坐在木堆上休息，询问大家的生活和家庭情况。谈到义务星期六运动时，列宁告诉大家说，我们将这样来建立我们的社会主义国家。经过义务星期六运动我们将过渡到共产主义劳动。
    休息时，列宁看到许多人都在吸烟，便对大家说烟草有毒害，抽烟损害健康。大家问列宁是否曾经抽过烟时，列宁说，青年时代曾经抽过，但是以后决心不抽，就一直不抽烟了。
    劳动越来越重。大家怕列宁太累了，都劝他早点回去。大家说，在人民委员会里，还有比体力劳动更重要的事情在等着他处理，这里少一个人，照样可以把活干完。列宁坚决不愿意提前离开。他说，不论职位如何，都必须参加义务星期六劳动。今天这个工作就是最重要的工作。
    列宁和大家一道一直劳动到结束的时刻。直到有人来请他去参加马克思、恩格斯纪念碑奠基典礼的时候，他才离开，这时距收工的时刻已经只有几分钟了。列宁和军事学校的战士们道了再见，祝贺他们今天参加了这个富有意义的全俄第一个义务星期六劳动。
    列宁就这样在四十年前，不仅指出了义务星期六运动的伟大意义，并且亲身参加了这一运动，树立了热爱劳动，遵守纪律的榜样。在四十年后的今天，在苏联进入全面开展共产主义建设的今天，在纪念列宁诞辰八十九周年的时候，列宁这一关于共产主义劳动的预言实现了。（附图片）
