Underground Heroes are All Ingenious

    Water Gun Driver Song Yongming
    In the hydraulic coal mining area of ​​Tangjiazhuang Mine, there is a water gun driver named Song Yongming. Recently, he created a new record of mining more than 900 tons of coal in one shift.
    At the beginning, the water gun team could only mine about 150 tons of coal. With such low efficiency, Lao Song felt pressured.
    One day, he splashed water on the ground, and the water didn't flow back; he splashed water on the wall, and it immediately splashed back. He thought: Splashing water on the ground is like the water from the water gun penetrating the coal and running into the old tunnels, with little coming back; splashing it on the wall causes it to splash back. That's right, if a small coal wall is left above the coal hole that has been penetrated, wouldn't the water bounce back! He immediately ran to the mine and went down the well, holding the water gun tightly. He left a small wall on each working face. The water bounced back off the wall, and the small pieces of coal flowed down quickly. The faster the coal flowed down, the more motivated Lao Song became. After one shift, he finished a pile and produced more than 170 tons of coal.
    One contradiction was resolved, and another arose. Lao Song was holding the water gun in his shift, shooting with great enthusiasm, when suddenly, a large piece of hard coal about one meter thick from the upper front of the coal fell down, blocking the trough opening, and the coal flowed down slowly again. It took several minutes to crush the piece of hard coal that was blocking it, which affected the efficiency of coal production. This happened for several days in a row. This problem troubled Lao Song so much that he couldn't sleep, pacing back and forth in his room. One day, he saw two eaves tiles buckled on the windowsill. He used his fist to "crack" and broke the convex one. He punched the concave tile again, and the tile shook a few times but didn't break. So he thought: If I change the method, first punch a hole in the coal, hollow out the inside, and then shoot the outside, just like smashing a convex tile. He went down the well that day and tried this method. By the time he finished two piles at the end of the shift, the efficiency had doubled.
    The increase in production could never satisfy this old miner with constantly revolutionary ideas. He always felt that the coal mining efficiency was low. He always felt that it took too long to flush the groove for coal extraction, requiring an hour. One day, he was mesmerized by the way a two-kick firecracker exploded in the air. He thought: The efficiency of coal digging is low, but after blasting, more coal is produced. Why can't the water mining face use this method? That's right, give it a try. He returned from the road to the bathhouse and went to the coal mining area office, told the district leaders, and they adopted his suggestion. The second shift went down the well and drilled three shot holes in the front of the coal where the groove was to be made. When the shot went off, a large kiln appeared on the coal face. Lao Song operated the water gun for twenty minutes, and a groove was made. The coal production per shift increased from more than 150 tons in the past to more than 700 tons, and the highest reached more than 900 tons.

    Resourceful and Courageous Xie Shimin
    Xie Shimin is a worker in the Hao Liguang tunneling team in the third tunneling area of ​​Tangshan Mine. Although he usually doesn't talk much, he is courageous and resourceful when he works.
    He has been in the mine for four years, doing work such as transporting materials, carrying coal, loading cars, and pushing cars. Some people think that doing this kind of work only requires strong arms and great strength, and there are no tricks to be found. However, Xie Shimin does not see it that way. With the deepening of the coal seizing battle in this mine, everyone is clamoring that there are not enough coal cars and not enough manpower. However, Xie Shimin carefully pondered the Party committee's call for clever work and carefully observed everywhere. He thought, if the idle tracks are used, and each shift digs and lays tracks, wouldn't it save a lot of coal cars and manpower? He put forward this suggestion and discussed it with the squad leader, Wang Wen, who supported him. They immediately started the experiment, and it was successful. It used to take six people to push the car, but now it only takes four.
    Wherever there is a key point, Xie Shimin can use his wisdom to overcome it. Due to production needs, he was recently transferred to tunneling work, and he is doing very well. Tunneling is fast, so the sheds must keep up. Others rely on their eyesight to cut pillars, which is slow and cannot guarantee quality. He studied the method of comparing the size of the pillar holes first, which is fast and does not require rework, doubling the efficiency. When making pillar eyes, it used to take two people to make them, with a shift progress of two meters, but now two people can make a shift progress of two and a half meters.
    Xie Shimin is not only good at improving production efficiency by improving operations, but he is also very good at arranging production time, without wasting a single minute or second. Every day when he goes to work, he sees that too much coal affects tunneling, so he grabs coal first. When other workers dig pillar nests, he prepares materials to ensure work continuity, so that the shed materials are ready before the pillar nests are dug.

    Liu Huanzhen Makes Use of Every Available Space
    The Liu Huanzhen tram team of Kailuan Linxi Mine is responsible for 40% of the mine's total transportation volume. Although the task is arduous, they have completed it excellently.
    Since the all-round leap forward, coal production has been increasing day by day, and the transportation volume has also been increasing. The mine leaders gave the Liu Huanzhen team a combat mission: to travel a distance of 7,624 meters from the No. 3 wellhead underground to the 29th roadway in the Fourth West District within 110 minutes for one cycle. Liu Huanzhen, this daring and capable young man, stood in front of the mine leaders and said with full confidence on behalf of all the workers in the team: "Our team is full of tigers, and we guarantee to meet the leaders' requirements." After Liu conveyed the leaders' requirements to the team members at the pre-shift meeting, the trams departed one after another. At this time, Liu's heart was pounding. He was not sure whether he could complete the task. He couldn't sit or stand still, so he followed the tram tracks and walked quickly to the roadway, then turned back to the No. 3 wellhead, carefully observing the operation of each train along the way. When the shift changed, Liu ran to the car house as if he were flying. The first thing he asked the drivers was: "How many minutes is one cycle?" "One hundred and five minutes," the workers replied. At this time, Liu felt relieved. Then he convened everyone for a meeting. Liu said: "Today, we only exceeded the requirement by five minutes, which is very dangerous! If there is a little accident, we will not be able to meet the requirement." At the same time, he solemnly pointed out several problems in driving. And said: If we drive fast, there will always be two locomotives in the roadway, one sending empty cars in and one pulling heavy cars out, which can save a lot of time for the cycle. Everyone agreed with Liu's opinion. The next day, each cycle was 85 minutes, shortening it by another 20 minutes.
    One day, the general branch secretary called him and said: "Xiao Liu, another task has come. On high-yield days, you must not only ensure that the coal is pulled out, but also send the materials used on the working face in." At that time, he represented the entire team and confidently expressed that he would definitely guarantee the completion of the task. After accepting the task, Liu calculated on the way home: In the past, coal was always produced during the two o'clock shift and materials were transported during the ten o'clock shift. This time, coal is produced day and night. When can we transport materials! Liu couldn't sleep well all night. The next day, he went down the well very early. At this time, work had not yet started, and the trams were parked in the car house. He thought, is it okay to send a load of materials now, even if it's not full! After a while, the tram drivers also came. Liu said to everyone: "Can't we send materials now?" When the drivers heard this, they said, "Yes!" Everyone immediately checked the vehicles and seized the time to transport them. Dozens of cars of wood were transported to the roadway on the working face before work started. The workers of the tram team called this method of transporting materials "making use of every available space."

    井下英雄个个巧
    水枪司机宋永明
    唐家庄矿水力采煤区有个水枪司机叫宋永明，最近他创造了一班采煤九百多吨的新纪录。
    开始，水枪一班只能采煤一百五十吨左右，效率这样低，老宋心里压的慌。
    一天，他往地上泼水，水不往回流；他把水泼到墙上，马上溅回来了。他想：水泼在地上等于水枪的水冲透了煤跑到老塘里，回来的少；往墙上泼就溅回来。对，要是把冲透了的煤洞上方留个小煤墙，水不也就碰回来了吗！他立刻跑到矿上下了井，紧把着水枪，每个掌子面都留一堵小墙，水在墙上碰回来了，冲的小碎片煤往下流的可快了，老宋看着煤往下流的越快，他的干劲越足，一班冲完了一个垛，出了一百七十多吨煤。
    一个矛盾解决了，一个矛盾又出现了。老宋在班上把着水枪，正冲的很来劲，呼啦一下子，煤的前面上方一块一公尺来厚的硬煤大块被冲下来，堵在槽子口上，煤又往下流的慢了，好几分钟才把这块堵上的硬煤冲碎，出煤的效率受到了影响。一连几天总是这样。这个难题压得老宋觉都睡不好，在屋子里来回转圈。一天，他看见窗台上扣着两片屋檐瓦，他用拳头
  “咔”的一下，就把那块凸的打碎了，又往那块凹的瓦上打了一拳，那片瓦摇晃了几下没有坏，于是他联想到：如果我改变方法，先把煤冲个洞，把里边掏空，然后再冲外边，就像砸凸瓦一样了。他当天下井按着这个方法一试，到下班冲完了两个垛，效率提高一倍。
    产量的提高对这位有不断革命思想的老矿工来说，是永远满足不了的。他总嫌采煤效率低。他总嫌冲煤拉槽口需要冲一个钟头时间太长。一天，他看着二踢脚在空中爆炸出了神。他想：刨煤效率低，实行放炮后，煤就出的多了，为甚么水采掌不能使这个办法呢？对，试一试。他由去澡塘子的路上返回来，到了采煤区办公室，向区领导一说，采纳了他的建议。第二班下井，在煤的前面拉槽子的地方打了三个炮眼，炮一响，煤面上出现了一个大窑。老宋操着水枪冲了二十分钟，一个槽子就拉好了，一班产煤由过去一百五十多吨，提高到七百多吨，最高达到过九百多吨。

    智勇双全的谢士民
    谢士民是唐山矿第三掘进区郝立广掘进队的工人，平时虽然不爱说话，但他干起活来，却是有勇有谋。
    他入矿四年，一直做运料、坌煤、装车、推车等工作，有些人认为干这种活，只要胳臂粗、力气大就行，没有什么窍门可找。可是谢士民却不这样看。随着这个矿夺煤大战的深入发展，大家都叫喊煤车不够用，人也不够使。可是，谢士民却仔细琢磨着党委关于巧干的号召，各处留心察看。他想，如果把闲置不用的车道，每班自己动手边掘进边往里铺，不是可以节省不少煤车和人力吗？他把这个建议提出来和小队长王文同志商量，王文支持他。马上动手试验，一试，果然成功了。原来六个人推车还不够，现在四个人就可以了。
    哪里有关键，谢士民都能用智慧战胜它。由于生产需要，最近把他调作掘进工作，他干得十分出色。掘进掘的快，棚棚子的必须赶上去，别人凭眼力砍柱子，又慢又不能保证质量，他就研究出按柱子坑先比好尺寸，砍的又快，还不出返手活，效率提高了一倍。做垛眼时，过去两个人做，班进两公尺，现在做到两个人班进两公尺半。
    谢士民不但善于用改进操作的办法提高生产效率，他还非常善于安排生产时间，一分一秒也不放过。每天一上班，他看到煤多影响掘进，他就先抢煤。别的工人刨柱窝，他为了保证工作衔接，就抓紧作材料，等柱窝刨完，棚棚子的材料也就早准备好了。

    刘焕珍见缝插针
    开滦林西矿刘焕珍电车小组担负着全矿40％的运输量，任务虽然艰巨，可是他们却出色地完成了。
    全面跃进以来，煤的产量一天比一天高，随着运输量也一个劲地增长，矿领导交给刘焕珍小组一项战斗任务：由井下三号井口到四西区二十九道石门七千六百二十四公尺的距离，要用一百一十分钟内走一个循环。刘焕珍这个敢想敢干的小伙子，站在矿领导的面前，代表全组工人信心百倍地说：“我们小组都是虎将，保证实现领导要求。”小刘在班前会上向组员们传达了领导的要求后，电车一辆接一辆地出发了，这时小刘的心里却七上八下的，能不能完成任务，他心里并没有底，他坐不稳立不安，就顺着电车道往石门里紧走，到二十九道石门又折回来奔向三号井口，一路上细心察看每列车的操作。换班了，小刘飞也似地跑到车房，第一句话就问开车的伙计们：“一个循环多少分钟？”“一百零五分钟”。工人们回答说。这时小刘才放心了。接着他又召集大家开会。小刘说：“今天才超过要求五分钟，多险哪！如果出一点事故就达不到要求了。”同时他又向大家郑重地提出了行车中的几个毛病。并说：如果我们行车快，叫石门里总有两个车头，一个往里送空车，一个往外拉重车，循环起来节省的时间可就多了。大家都很赞成小刘的意见。第二天每个循环是八十五分钟，又缩短了二十分钟。
    一天，总支书记把他叫去说：“小刘，又来任务了，你们在高产日不但要保证把煤拉出来，还要把掌子上用的材料送进去。”当时他代表全小组，信心十足地表示一定保证完成任务。接受任务后小刘在回家的路上就盘算：过去总是两点班出煤十点班运料，这回昼夜出煤，什么时候运料哇！小刘一夜翻来复去地也没睡好觉。第二天，他很早就下井了。这时还未开工，电车在车房放着，他想现在要送一趟材料不满可以吗！一会电车司机们也来了，小刘对大家说：“现在不就可以送材料吗？”司机们一听，对呀！大家马上检查车辆，抓紧运输，好几十车木料在掌子面上还未开工时就运到石门了。这天小刘又跟着车跑起来，他指挥着各个列车，一进空车就往煤罐里装小柱子，利用一切时间往石门里运材料，电车组的工人们管这种运料方法叫“见缝插针”。
