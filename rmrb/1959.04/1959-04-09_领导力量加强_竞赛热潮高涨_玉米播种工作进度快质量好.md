(Xinhua News Agency) The spring corn planting work is gradually unfolding from south to north. Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong and other provinces and autonomous regions have generally started planting. Guizhou Province has planted 3,968,000 mu of corn. Guangxi has planted 5,880,000 mu of corn, exceeding the planting plan by 15.7%. The early corn seedlings are now more than eight inches tall, and the medium corn seedlings are three or four inches tall. Provinces in the Yangtze River basin, such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan, are seizing the time to plant. Anhui Province has planted 520,000 mu of spring corn. By April 1st, the Huaiyin Special Zone in Jiangsu Province had planted 1,830,000 mu of corn and sorghum, accounting for 46.9% of the planned planting area for this special zone this year. Some areas in the Yellow River basin, such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Ningxia, have begun planting. Provinces in the Northeast, such as Liaoning, are stepping up preparations to meet the upcoming planting tasks.

This year, the corn planting work in various places has been fast and of good quality. Many places have strengthened the leadership of the corn planting work, adjusted the labor force, and expanded the corn planting team. Funing County in Yunnan Province transferred 6,489 strong laborers to form a professional team for corn planting, which accelerated the planting progress and improved the planting quality. More than 32,700 mu of corn have been planted here, about fifteen days earlier than in previous years. People's communes in the Bijie Special Zone of Guizhou Province have opened training classes for planting technicians, training a total of 490,000 people in the region. Therefore, the planting progress is fast, and the quality is also higher than in previous years.

This year, a new technology - corn directional planting method - has been promoted in corn planting. In order to strive for large-scale and high-yield corn production on 10 million mu of land in the province this year, Sichuan Province is vigorously promoting the corn directional planting method created by Zhang Mingde, Secretary of the Shangxia People's Commune Party Committee in Xuanhan County, during the Great Leap Forward last year. Using this method, the corn leaves can grow to both sides in the specified direction, solving the contradiction between ventilation, light transmission, and close planting.

In order to grasp the planting stage well, many regions have set off a heatwave of competition between communes, teams, groups, and individuals. In Guihua People's Commune, Jianshi County, Hubei Province, a five-comparison competition movement was launched between teams and individuals, comparing the completion of planting plans, etc. The enthusiasm of the masses has doubled, and corn planting has been fast and good. The commune has completed this year's task of planting 15,000 mu of corn. In the Huaiyin Special Zone of Jiangsu Province, communes, teams, groups, and individuals found their own opponents, setting off a climax of communes, teams, and individuals striving to be the best. By April 1st, more than two million laborers in the region had planted 1,830,000 mu of corn and sorghum.

This year, the preparation for corn planting has been more sufficient and solid than in previous years. According to inspections in various places, deep plowing is generally three to four inches deeper than in previous years, and fertilizer has also increased significantly, generally applying about 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. Various places have also promoted hybrid corn varieties and improved varieties such as Jin Huanghou and Da Mayazi. Before reasonable close planting, the seeds were also treated for disease and pest control. The corn planted in the Bijie Special Zone of Guizhou Province is generally deeply ploughed more than eight inches, with 50,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu, and 3,000 to 4,000 nests planted per mu. The eight million mu of corn and sorghum fields in the Xuzhou Special Zone of Jiangsu Province have been deeply ploughed and finely harrowed. Where irrigation conditions are available, ridge fields have been created, and about 10,000 jin of fertilizer are applied per mu, doubling last year. The Guihua Commune in Hubei Province inspected 4,000 mu of planted corn, all deeply ploughed one chi, with 10,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu.

    领导力量加强　竞赛热潮高涨
    玉米播种工作进度快质量好
    据新华社讯　春玉米播种工作正由南向北逐步展开。云南、贵州、四川、广西、广东等省、自治区已普遍播种。贵州省已种玉米三百九十六万八千亩。广西播种玉米五百八十八万亩，超额15.7％完成播种计划，现早玉米苗生长八寸多高，中玉米苗三、四寸高。长江流域的江苏、安徽、湖北、湖南等省正在抢时间进行播种。安徽省已播春玉米五十二万亩。江苏省淮阴专区到4月1日已播玉米和高粱一百八十三万亩，占今年这个专区计划播种面积的46.9％。黄河流域的陕西、甘肃、河南、山东、山西、宁夏等省区部分地区开始播种。东北的辽宁等省正在突击进行准备工作，迎接即将到来的播种任务。
    今年，各地玉米播种工作进度快，质量好。许多地方都加强了玉米播种工作的领导，并调整了劳动力，扩大了玉米播种队伍。云南省富宁县抽调六千四百八十九个精壮劳动力组成专业队伍进行玉米播种工作，加快了播种进度，提高了播种质量。这里已播下三万二千七百多亩玉米，播种时间比往年提早了十五天左右。贵州省毕节专区各人民公社开办了播种技术人员训练班，全区共训练了四十九万人，因此，播种进度快，质量也比往年高。
    今年在玉米种植方面，推广了一种新的技术——玉米定向种植法。四川省为了争取全省今年一千万亩玉米大面积高产，正在大力推广宣汉县上峡人民公社党委书记张明德在去年大跃进中创造的玉米定向种植法。采用这种方法，可使玉米叶片按照指定的方向向两侧生长，解决通风透光和密植的矛盾。
    不少地区为了抓好播种关，掀起了社与社、队与队、组与组、人与人竞赛的热潮。湖北省建始县桂花人民公社队与队、人与人之间掀起了比完成播种计划等五比竞赛运动，群众的干劲倍增，播种玉米又快又好，全社已完成了今年播种一万五千亩玉米的任务。江苏省淮阴专区全区社与社、队与队、组与组、人与人自找对手，掀起了社社、队队、人人争上游的高潮，全区二百多万劳动大军到4月1日已播种玉米、高粱一百八十三万亩。
    今年玉米播种准备工作比往年充分、扎实。据各地检查表明，深耕一般比往年深三到四寸，肥料比往年也增加不少，一般每亩施底肥一万斤左右，各地还推广了玉米杂交品种和金皇后、大马牙等良种，在合理密植播种前，还对种子进行了防病虫害的处理。贵州省毕节专区播种的玉米，一般都深耕八寸以上，每亩施肥料五万斤，每亩种三千窝到四千窝。江苏徐州专区八百万亩玉米、高粱田，都进行了深耕细耙，有灌溉条件的做到了畦田化，每亩施肥在一万斤左右，比去年增加一倍。湖北省桂花公社检查播种的四千亩玉米，都深耕一尺，每亩施肥一万斤。
