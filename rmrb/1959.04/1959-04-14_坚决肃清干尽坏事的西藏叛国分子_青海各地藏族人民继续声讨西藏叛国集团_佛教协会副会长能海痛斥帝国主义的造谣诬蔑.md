Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 13th: The Tibetan people in various parts of Qinghai Province continue to denounce the towering crimes of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique in betraying the motherland and harming the people.
　　Zha Xi Caiwang Duojie, the governor of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which is adjacent to Tibet, said that the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique's conspiracy to separate Tibet from the big family of the motherland will never be realized, because the Tibetan people know that they can only have a happy life under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. He cited the situation in Yushu area as an example, saying that before liberation, the Tibetan people here did not have enough food to eat or clothes to wear, and their families were destroyed and displaced, reaching the point where nine out of ten houses were empty. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the face of Yushu area has completely changed. By last year, the number of livestock of all kinds had more than doubled compared with the initial period of liberation in 1949, and the average yield per mu of grain in the whole prefecture had also increased from dozens of jin before liberation to hundreds of jin. Over the years, the people's government has also allocated more than 420,000 yuan in loans to Yushu area to support poor farmers and herdsmen in developing production. Before liberation, Yushu had no industry or roads at all, and now 48 factories and mines have been put into production, and more than 780 kilometers of roads are open to traffic. Before liberation, there was only one primary school in the whole prefecture, and it was not allowed to use Tibetan or study Tibetan language. Now there are 99 primary schools, 14 middle schools, and literacy classes everywhere in the whole prefecture. These schools and study classes are all learning Tibetan characters. More than 90% of school-age children and young adults have the opportunity to study. Health organizations have been established in prefectures, counties, and districts, greatly reducing the suffering of the masses from diseases. People's religious beliefs are completely free.
　　Zha Xi Caiwang Duojie particularly talked about the situation in Yushu area after the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy under the leadership of the Party, where the Tibetan people are the masters in managing their own ethnic affairs. He said that before liberation, the Tibetan people in Yushu did not even have a tax office director. Now, from the governor and deputy governors of the prefectural people's committee to the township-level government, the main positions are held by Tibetan cadres. There are already more than 780 Tibetan cadres in various work positions throughout the prefecture. These facts clearly show who created happiness for the Tibetan people and who drove the Tibetan people into the abyss of suffering. He said: "For the interests of our Tibetan people, and in order to enable the Tibetan people to get rid of the backward state as soon as possible and develop into an advanced nation as soon as possible, we, the Tibetan people of Yushu, fully support the order of the State Council."
　　Mi Futang (Tibetan), the deputy governor of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, also said that only after liberation did the Tibetan people see the sun after breaking through the dark clouds, ending their past miserable life and starting to live an equal, free, and happy life. The towering crime of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique attempting to split the motherland will surely be唾骂(tuò mà - cursed) by future generations of Tibetans.
　　Mo Ji, the vice chairman of the CPPCC of Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said that the Golog Tibetan people have a deep feeling for the Tibetan people and have close exchanges and contacts for a long time. We deeply know that the vast number of Tibetan people love the motherland and the Communist Party. We feel extremely angry about the crimes of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique in carrying out armed rebellion against wishes of the Tibetan people and destroying the happy life of the Tibetan people.
　　Wang Mo (Tibetan), the deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Women's Federation, said that the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique's attempt to stop the progress of the Tibetan people will inevitably be crushed into powder by the wheel of history. She said: Tibetan women have only gained freedom and seen the sun since liberation. In order to safeguard the unification of the motherland and enable all Tibetan people to live a happy life forever, I warmly support the order of the State Council.
　　Huangnan, Hainan, and Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures have also held symposiums to denounce the Tibetan traitorous clique. Zhuo Jia (Tibetan), the secretary of the CPC Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Committee, said: We deeply know that the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups are the guarantee for the smooth socialist construction of the people of all ethnic groups in the country and the maintenance of the happy life of the people of all ethnic groups. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in Huangnan will cherish the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups as they cherish their own eyeballs, and resolutely oppose any conspiracy to create national divisions and undermine the unification of the motherland.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Neng Hai, vice president of the Buddhist Association of China, issued a statement saying that the imperialists and foreign reactionaries' slander against our country's policy of freedom of religious belief is completely futile.
　　He said that the imperialists and foreign reactionaries, in lamenting the shameful failure of the Tibetan rebellion they had planned, have wantonly spread rumors and slanders, saying that China is "destroying religion." They are deliberately fabricating this clumsy lie, which cannot deceive anyone. May I ask: Who kidnapped the Dalai Lama? Who installed cannons in the Potala Palace? Who robbed the precious offerings from the temples? Isn't it those traitorous elements who did it? The traitorous elements have committed all kinds of evil, and the People's Liberation Army was ordered to suppress the bandits, precisely to protect the interests of the Tibetan people and protect freedom of religious belief.
　　In his speech, Neng Hai also used the facts he witnessed in Tibet before and after liberation to illustrate that the Tibetan traitorous elements cannot expect to gain the support of the Tibetan people, and that they are digging their own graves by launching a rebellion. He said, I went to Lhasa to study Buddhism and lived in Tibet for more than ten years. Before liberation, the vast number of Tibetan people were under the threat of hunger, disease, due to imperialist aggression from outside, the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries from inside, and the corrupt social system. At the same time, due to the instigation of the imperialists, internal disputes often occurred within the Tibetan nation, bandits were rampant, and people were struggling to survive. The corruption and darkness of the Tibetan local government, its greed and accumulation of wealth, and its oppression of the people were exactly the same as those of the reactionary rulers in the interior. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the PLA troops stationed in Tibet and the personnel entering Tibet did a lot of good things for the Tibetan people and were warmly loved by the Tibetan people. The protection of Lama temples and the implementation of the policy of freedom of religious belief were carried out extremely meticulously and thoughtfully. All the Tibetan religious figures I came into contact with sincerely expressed their gratitude. However, a small handful of Tibetan upper-class reactionary cliques, in order to maintain their extremely corrupt rule, in order to ride on the heads of the vast number of Tibetan people forever, colluded with imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, and openly launched an armed rebellion. These traitorous elements violated the will of the Tibetan people and cannot expect to gain the support of the Tibetan people. They are digging their own graves.
　　The famous figure in Buddhist circles also pointed out that the future of the Tibetan people is inseparable from the unification and prosperity of the motherland. The imperialists' attempt to separate Tibet from the big family of the motherland is always a dream. The enlightened vast number of Tibetan monks and lay people will not be deceived by them. The rapid suppression of the Lhasa rebellion illustrates this fact.
　　Neng Hai concluded by saying that I firmly support the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and completely quell the rebellion, and will do everything in my power to support the Tibetan people in completing the tasks set forth in the State Council's order.

　　青海各地藏族人民继续声讨西藏叛国集团
　　佛教协会副会长能海痛斥帝国主义的造谣诬蔑
    新华社西宁13日电　青海省各地的藏族人民继续声讨西藏上层反动集团背叛祖国、残害人民的滔天罪行。
    毗邻西藏的玉树藏族自治州的州长扎喜·才旺多杰说，西藏上层反动集团妄想把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去的阴谋是永远不会实现的，因为藏族人民都知道，他们只有在中国共产党的领导下才会有幸福的生活。他举玉树地区的情况为例说，解放以前这里的藏族人民粮不果腹、衣不蔽体，人民家破人亡，流离失所，已经到了十室十空的地步。解放后，在共产党的领导下，玉树地区的面貌完全改观了。到去年为止，各类牲畜比解放初期的1949年增加了一倍多，全州粮食的平均亩产量也由解放前的几十斤提高到几百斤。历年来，人民政府还给玉树地区拨付了四十二万多元的贷款，扶植贫苦农牧民发展生产。解放前玉树根本没有一点工业，一条公路，现在已经有四十八个厂矿投入生产，七百八十多公里畅通无阻的公路。解放前全州只有一所小学，还不准用藏语、学藏文，现在全州已有九十九所小学，十四所中学，扫盲识字班到处都是，这些学校和学习班都在学习藏族文字。90％以上的学龄儿童和青壮年都有机会学习。州县区都建立了卫生机构，大大减少了群众的疾病痛苦。人民的宗教信仰完全自由。
    扎喜·才旺多杰特别谈到玉树地区在党领导下实行民族区域自治以后，藏族人民在管理本民族事务中当家作主的情形。他说，解放前玉树藏族连一个当税务所长的人都没有，而现在从州人民委员会的正、副州长一直到乡级政权，主要的职务都是由藏族干部担任，全州各个工作岗位上已有七百八十多名藏族干部。这些事实明显地说明了是谁为藏族人民缔造幸福，谁把藏族人民驱进苦难的深渊。他说：“为了我们藏族人民的利益，为了使藏族能早日摆脱落后的状态，尽快发展为先进的民族，我们玉树藏族人民完全拥护国务院的命令。”
    玉树藏族自治州副州长米福堂（藏族）也发表谈话说，只有解放以后藏族人民才拨开乌云见了太阳，结束了过去悲惨的生活，开始过着平等自由和幸福的日子。西藏上层反动集团妄图分裂祖国的滔天罪行，必将为藏族后代子孙所唾骂。
    果洛藏族自治州政协副主席默济说，果洛藏族人民和西藏人民有着深厚的感情，长期以来有着密切的来往和联系，我们深知西藏广大人民是热爱祖国、热爱共产党的。我们对西藏上层反动集团违背西藏人民意愿进行武装叛乱、破坏西藏人民幸福生活的罪行感到无比愤怒。
    青海省妇女联合会副主任王莫（藏族）说，西藏上层反动集团妄想阻挡西藏人民的进步，其结果必将被历史的巨轮辗成粉碎。她说：解放后藏族妇女才得到了自由，看见了太阳。为了维护祖国统一和使全体藏族人民都能永远过幸福生活，我热烈拥护国务院的命令。
    黄南、海南、海北藏族自治州也都纷纷举行座谈会，声讨西藏叛国集团。中共黄南藏族自治州州委书记卓加（藏族）说：我们深知祖国的统一和各民族的团结，是全国各族人民顺利地进行社会主义建设维护各族人民幸福生活的保证。因此，黄南各族人民将像爱护自己的眼珠一样来维护祖国的统一和各民族的团结，坚决反对任何制造民族分裂和破坏祖国统一的阴谋。
    新华社13日讯　中国佛教协会副会长能海发表谈话说，帝国主义和外国反动派对我国宗教信仰自由政策的造谣诬蔑，完全是白费心机。
    他说，帝国主义和外国反动派在哀叹他们策划的西藏叛乱遭到可耻失败之余，大肆造谣诬蔑，说什么中国在“毁灭宗教”。他们别有用心地编造这种拙劣的谎言，欺骗不了任何人。试问：劫持达赖喇嘛的是谁？在布达拉宫架设大炮的是谁？劫走寺庙贵重供器的是谁？不正是那些叛国分子干的吗？叛国分子干尽了坏事，人民解放军奉命讨伐叛匪，正是为了保护西藏人民的利益和保护宗教信仰自由。
    能海在谈话中还以解放前后在西藏目睹的事实，说明西藏叛国分子不可能指望得到西藏人民的支持，他们发动叛乱是在自掘坟墓。他说，我曾到拉萨学习佛法，先后在西藏住了十余年。解放以前的西藏，外有帝国主义的侵略，内有国民党反动派的压迫，加上腐朽的社会制度，西藏广大人民处于饥寒疾病的威胁之下。同时由于帝国主义者的挑拨，西藏民族内部也时常发生纷争，土匪为患，民不聊生，西藏地方政府的腐败黑暗，贪污聚敛，压榨人民，与内地的反动统治者如出一辙。西藏和平解放以后，人民解放军驻藏部队和进藏工作人员，给西藏人民作了很多好事，受到西藏人民的热烈爱戴。对于保护喇嘛寺庙，贯彻宗教信仰自由政策，执行得极为细密周至。凡我所接触到的西藏宗教界人士，无不衷心地表示感激。但是一小撮西藏上层反动集团，为了维护他们腐败透顶的统治，为了永久骑在广大西藏人民的头上，竟勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，公然发动武装叛乱。这些叛国分子违背了西藏人民的意志，是不可能指望得到西藏人民支持的，他们是在自掘坟墓。
    这位佛教界著名人士还指出，西藏人民的前途，和祖国的统一与富强不可分割。帝国主义者妄图使西藏脱离祖国的大家庭，这永远是梦想，觉悟了的广大西藏僧俗人民，是不会受他们蛊惑的。拉萨叛乱的迅速平息，就说明了这一事实。
    能海最后说，我坚决拥护国务院关于解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛乱的命令，并尽自己一切力量，支援西藏人民完成国务院命令所提出的任务。
