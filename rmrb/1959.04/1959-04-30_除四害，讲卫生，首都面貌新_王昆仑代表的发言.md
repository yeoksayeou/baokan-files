Comrades,

I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. Now I will speak to the congress on Beijing's patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests and eradicating major diseases.

To Achieve a Great Leap Forward in Patriotic Health, We Must Turn the Capital into a City Free of Four Pests

In the ten years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, Beijing has undergone a great socialist revolution and socialist construction, fundamentally changing a long-standing, decadent consumer city. As the capital of our socialist New China, Beijing's appearance has been completely renewed. With the development of industrial and agricultural production and various urban construction projects, Beijing achieved a great leap forward in the patriotic health movement centered on "eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eradicating diseases" in 1958. Under the loving care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, the people enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and the provisions of the National Programme for Agricultural Development, issuing the oath to "turn the capital into a city free of four pests," and enthusiastically participated in the movement. In one year, sixteen city-wide campaigns were launched successively, eliminating 5.07 million rats, 6.59 million sparrows, and countless mosquitoes and flies. In order to eliminate breeding grounds for flies and mosquitoes, 340,000 toilets were renovated in conjunction with fertilizer accumulation, and mud-sealing composting was initially promoted using organic waste and human and animal excrement. In conjunction with municipal construction and water conservancy projects, more than 12,000 stagnant water pits were treated. The renovated pits in the urban and suburban areas were equivalent to forty-six Taoranting Lakes. The dredged ditches were equivalent to twenty-three Dragon Beard Ditches. The large stinking ditch near the urban area was transformed into ten artificial lakes with a fresh environment suitable for production. In order to prevent major infectious diseases in Beijing, medical personnel combined with the masses to launch a mass movement, resolutely fighting against dysentery and measles, flattening the dysentery peak of last August and controlling the expansion and spread of severe measles in winter. Dysentery incidence decreased by about half compared with 1957, encephalitis decreased by about one-sixth, and the mortality rate of tuberculosis decreased by about one-fifth. Based on last year's work, this spring, combined with the collection of agricultural fertilizer, we continued to vigorously carry out environmental sanitation, digging and destroying maggots, and swatting sparrows. Recently, the people of the city are launching a sanitation blitz to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day.

Production Needs Hygiene, Hygiene is for Production; Turn the Unfavorable into the Favorable, Protect People's Health

Hygiene work serves production, so it is necessary to closely combine with production and obey the needs of production. Our patriotic health movement has played a positive role in ensuring the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various socialist construction undertakings in the capital. More than forty industrial and mining units, such as the Capital Iron and Steel Company in Shijingshan, have significantly improved the health levels of their employees by vigorously promoting hygiene. In 1958, the average absenteeism rate due to illness decreased by approximately 33% compared to 1957. The Beijing Third General Machinery Plant combined civilized production with vigorous hygiene efforts, forming a conscious movement. Each workshop has workers who serve as safety and hygiene officers, implementing three-time cleaning (early morning, noon, and after shift), dividing areas of responsibility, sweeping the workshop weekly (small sweep), and monthly (big sweep). Hygiene is evaluated alongside production, with advanced units receiving red flags. Therefore, although production is busy, the workshop is orderly and the environment is exceptionally clean. The factory pays special attention to the dietary hygiene of employees, adhering to the inspection and acceptance, and disinfection system of the cafeteria. Last year, the incidence of dysentery decreased by approximately 91%. In 1958, the absenteeism rate due to illness decreased by 52% compared to 1957. In 1958, the annual leap forward plan was completed 25 days ahead of schedule. The Beijing No. 3 Leather Factory, formerly known as the "stinky leather factory," used to be plagued by flies, dysentery, and a pervasive odor, causing disturbance to the surrounding neighbors. After a vigorous hygiene campaign, all factory employees were determined to "turn the stinky leather factory into a fragrant leather factory." They regularly ensure the cleanliness of the environment, workshops, and themselves, completely changing the phenomenon of "fine hair flying everywhere and scrap leather littering the ground." Male and female employees are healthy and in good spirits. They created electric air blowers to replace the unhealthy method of blowing hair with their mouths, increasing work efficiency by eight times. In the first quarter of this year, daily, ten-day, and monthly output exceeded the targets, the output value increased by 28%, and labor productivity increased by 31%.

The broad masses of farmers have improved some aspects of rural hygiene in conjunction with agricultural production. In order to "turn water hazards into water conservancy and turn stagnant water into living water," 1,599 water pits in the suburbs were transformed into small reservoirs and canals, which can be used for irrigation and fish farming, and can also eliminate mosquito breeding. The promotion of mud-sealing composting added more than 1 billion jin of high-quality fertilizer last year. This spring, in order to meet the needs of agricultural production, combined with improving environmental hygiene, the city mobilized to sweep streets and courtyards, clear garbage, empty toilets, and dig ditch mud, accumulating a large amount of fertilizer.

In order to protect the labor force and protect people's health, medical institutions at all levels organized medical teams. Twenty-two hospitals and medical schools sent more than 1,200 people to form medical teams to go deep into factories, communes, and carry out disease prevention and treatment work, help grassroots units establish clinics, set up simple sickbeds, assist people's communes in training "three personnel" (health workers, childcare workers, and cooks), guide the hygiene work of canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens in urban streets and suburban communes, protect children's health, and also ensure the production and labor of mothers. The medical team of Beijing Third Hospital went deep into the mold-casting workshop of Beijing First Machine Tool Plant, which had the highest absenteeism rate, followed workers' shifts, studied the causes of illness, and helped improve operating methods, so that the absenteeism rate of workers due to illness quickly dropped by 40%.

Eliminate Ideological Obstacles, Cultivate Hygienic Habits; Seize Advanced Models, Boost Mass Enthusiasm

The great leap forward in Beijing's hygiene work in 1958 was fundamentally due to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, putting politics in command, and implementing the mass line. Party and government leaders at all levels grasped planning, grasped publicity, grasped inspection, and mobilized the masses, constantly setting off a high tide of mass movement. The in-depth development of the movement has brought about great changes in the ideology and life of the broad masses of people, and has achieved the effect of inspiring everyone and changing customs. In the process of movement development, there were many ideological obstacles: "Mosquitoes and flies can't be eliminated, rats and sparrows can't be stolen," "Flies and mosquitoes are trivial matters, not worth making a fuss about," "Production work can't be finished, how can there be time to talk about hygiene," "Houses are old, dilapidated, and there are many sundries, conditions are not good, can't do it." Through presenting facts, calculating detailed accounts, organizing exhibitions, organizing visits, holding on-site meetings, and other measures, erroneous ideas were corrected, and the consciousness of the masses was improved, so that people deeply realized that this is a matter of the health of the broad masses of people, ensuring production, and benefiting future generations, and established the confidence and determination to "make sparrows have no way to heaven, make rats have no way to enter the ground, and make mosquitoes and flies have no offspring!" Grasping advanced models, launching point-to-area, conducting evaluations and competitions, can constantly encourage the masses to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced. In the previous battles, wherever the Party pointed, the masses went, fighting high-spiritedly and striving to be first. To eliminate house rats, every household put down rat traps, rat poison, moved boxes and overturned cabinets to block rat holes. To eliminate ditch rats, with a shot of artillery, everyone mobilized together, smoking 420 kilometers of underground ditches in the urban area, digging artificial lakes, not afraid of the cold or freezing, not afraid of freezing into thousands of kilograms of ice, workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and merchants all went to the battlefield together. To eliminate sparrows, three million people fought for three days, bombing, poisoning, hitting, and digging, supporting each other, demonstrating a high degree of collectivism and organization and discipline. The masses sang heroic verses: "The sparrow extermination battle shows heroism, the people's enthusiasm soars to the sky, waving flags and beating drums, thousands of troops move, to make the sparrows' souls disappear!"

The habit of paying attention to hygiene has also gradually been cultivated among the masses. Several advanced units have basically maintained the regular four cleans (clean streets, clean courtyards, clean rooms, clean toilets). In the past, the Taoyuan Neighborhood Committee outside Yongdingmen was full of garbage and casually poured sewage. Some people said, "To make hygiene good, unless iron trees bloom and horses grow horns." However, with the development of the movement and changes in thinking, all residents not only participated in production but also fundamentally changed the sanitary appearance. They said, "We are poor and blank, but our enthusiasm is high, production and hygiene are both beautiful flowers." In Liulitun, Yongfeng People's Commune in the suburbs, agricultural production doubled last year, labor was well arranged, and commune members swept the streets before going to the fields every day and after finishing work. Men, women, old, and young engaged in hygiene, which became a regular habit. Several canteens of people's communes have achieved the requirement of not only eating well but also eating cleanly. The Youanmen Production Station of Nanyuan People's Commune made coarse grains finely and fine grains skillfully, which was both nutritious and hygienic, and everyone was satisfied.

In order to control infectious diseases that seriously endanger people's health, Beijing launched a mass disease prevention movement with medical personnel as the backbone. Traditional Chinese and Western medicine cooperated closely in visiting work and medical work, implemented the principle of combining cadres, medical personnel, and the masses under the leadership of the Party organization, went out of hospitals, went to factories, went to the countryside, went to the land, and played a valuable role in serving the people. The broad masses of people gained knowledge of disease prevention from medical personnel and were moved by their enthusiasm. Medical personnel were also encouraged by the masses. In the summer fly-swatting and dysentery prevention campaign, medical personnel went from house to house, visiting, publicizing, and treating, and brought microscopes to show the masses flies and germs, enhancing the effect of publicity and education. In the winter prevention and treatment of measles, they put forward the slogan of "patients do not go out, medicine is delivered to the home." The urban area was divided into 124 disease prevention areas, and more than 1,130 medical personnel were assigned to each area to take charge of the front line of disease prevention. Because of the rectification movement, medical personnel improved their political awareness and sense of responsibility to the people. One doctor visited a sick child's home more than 41 times until he recovered. A doctor in a commune guarded a child with pneumonia for three days and nights. Doctors and nurses in many hospitals worked day and night, doing everything possible to rescue critically ill children, and many people gave their blood for emergency treatment, and many mothers shed tears of emotion. Many moving events showed the noble communist style of our medical personnel.

Combining Blitzes with Regular Efforts, Combining Curing Symptoms with Addressing Root Causes, Combining Mass Movements with Technical Measures

We have adopted three combined working methods to increase the combat power of eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating diseases. First, combine blitzes with regular efforts. The effect of the blitz is to improve, and the role of regularity is to consolidate. According to the living rules of the four pests, the epidemic situation of diseases, combined with the habits of the people, hold several city-wide blitzes in a year, stipulate goals, and concentrate forces, which can achieve great results. After the blitz, it is necessary to establish a system, develop habits, and adhere to regular work, in order to consolidate and improve the results of the blitz. Blitzes and regularity must be carried out alternately and continuously, forming a wave-like movement. Second, combine curing symptoms with addressing root causes. The four pests are large in number and reproduce quickly, so comprehensive measures must be taken to repeatedly eliminate them. The measures taken against rats are beating, poisoning, blocking, and fumigating; against sparrows, they are bombing, poisoning, hitting, and digging; against mosquitoes and flies, they are swatting, smoking, and spraying drugs. And it is necessary to adapt to the season to "fight early, fight small, and fight them off." In order to eliminate and eradicate them, we must also take measures to address the root causes. For flies, we must renovate toilets and treat feces; for mosquitoes, we must turn over pots and cans and treat stagnant water. Curing symptoms and addressing root causes are indispensable. Third, combine mass movements with technical measures. The elimination of pests and diseases mainly relies on carrying out mass movements on a large scale, but there must also be technical measures to strengthen its effect, and simple and easy technical measures must be gradually mastered by the masses themselves.

The achievements of our hygiene work are inseparable from the mutual support and cooperation of all parties. First, we resolutely implemented "block by block responsibility, line by line implementation." With this kind of working method that combines blocks and lines, the urban and suburban districts can strengthen unified leadership, and each line system can also play a role in promoting. Many central organs and troops stationed in Beijing not only regularly do a good job in their own hygiene work but also actively support the local masses' blitz movements, playing a leading role among the masses. In addition, we have learned advanced experiences from fraternal provinces and cities and have been encouraged and supported by them, which has also been a driving force for us.

Persist Unremittingly, Fight Repeatedly, Continue to Leap Forward and Strive for the Upstream

The new situation in 1959 brings new requirements to the patriotic health movement. This year, Beijing's industrial and agricultural production and urban construction must have a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. The more intense production labor is, the more necessary it is to ensure the health of the labor force; the new situation requires further implementation of the policy of serving production with hygiene. Rural people's communes have universally established collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens. The new situation requires close attention to the lives of the masses and doing a good job in hygiene work in collective life. This year is the tenth anniversary of our great National Day. Like people all over the country, the people of the capital will use outstanding labor achievements to welcome the celebration. Further eliminating more of the four pests and greatly reducing major diseases, and presenting a clean and fresh city to the tenth anniversary of the National Day is the common wish of the people of the capital.

Although Beijing's hygiene work has made many achievements in the past year, there are still many problems. The four pests have not been completely eliminated, and as long as there are breeding conditions, they will take the opportunity to breed and rise again. The people's hygienic habits have not been universally developed or cannot be consolidated, and the arduousness of the work is obvious. However, with the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the successful experience of 1958, and the vigorous enthusiasm of the people of the city, these are all favorable conditions. As long as we persist in implementing the mass line, combining hygiene workers with the masses, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, persisting unremittingly, fighting repeatedly, going all out, and striving for the upstream, Beijing's patriotic health movement in 1959 will surely achieve a greater leap forward.

China's Internal Affairs Must Not Be Interfered with by Foreign Countries; Tibet Will Always Be Tibet of China

I fully agree with the speeches of all the representatives on the Tibet issue, and firmly support the central government's policy and guidelines for Tibet and the resolute measures to thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits. Tibet is Chinese territory, which has been known to the world from ancient times to the present. Tibetan insurgents hijacked the Dalai Lama and fled to India. India is a friendly neighbor that coexists peacefully with China. Indian diplomatic officials have even distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," and a group of expansionists have wantonly clamored and slandered, attempting to undermine China's unity and split the solidarity of Chinese nationalities. There have even been insults to the image of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, which is really intolerable to all Chinese people. I believe that the Indian government, facing this situation, should feel responsible for its friendly neighbor, China. I express my great anger at the Indian expansionists here; I give a sincere warning to the Indian authorities, and I urge the Indian authorities to cherish the friendship between China and India, strictly abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and must take due measures against the conspiracy to undermine China's territorial sovereignty that exists in India. The Chinese people will never allow the conspiracy of imperialism and foreign reactionaries to undermine China's unity and national solidarity to succeed. Their arrogant attempt will surely meet with a shameful defeat in front of the Chinese people.

I want to shout loudly here: China's internal affairs will never be allowed to be interfered with by foreign countries! Tibet will always be Tibet of China!

专栏：

    除四害，讲卫生，首都面貌新
    王昆仑代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告。现在我就北京市开展以除四害、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动向大会发言。
    实现爱国卫生大跃进一定要把首都变成四无城
    解放十年，在党和政府的领导下，北京市进行了伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，使一个古老陈腐的消费城市，起了根本性的变化；作为我们社会主义新中国首都的北京，面貌已经焕然一新。随着工农业生产和各种城市建设事业的发展，一九五八年北京市实现了以
  “除四害讲卫生消灭疾病”为中心的爱国卫生运动的大跃进。在党中央、毛主席亲切关怀和北京市委、市人民委员会的领导下，人民群众热烈响应党的号召，贯彻执行党中央和国务院的指示以及农业发展纲要的规定，发出了“一定要把首都变成四无城”的誓言，踊跃参加运动。在一年之中连续发动全市范围的十六次大战役，消灭老鼠五百零七万只，麻雀六百五十九万只，扑灭蚊蝇难以数计。为了消灭苍蝇、蚊子的孳生场所，结合积肥，改造了三十四万座厕所，利用有机垃圾和人畜粪便，初步推行了泥封堆肥，结合市政建设和兴修水利，处理了一万二千多处积水坑洼，仅城区、近郊改造的坑洼，相当于四十六个陶然亭湖。把城区附近的大臭水坑，变成了十个环境清新可以生产的人工湖。疏通的沟渠等于二十三条龙须沟。为了防治北京市主要传染病，医务人员和群众相结合，大搞群众运动，向痢疾、麻疹作坚决的斗争，曾经削平了去年八月的痢疾高峰，控制冬季来势凶猛的麻疹的扩大蔓延。痢疾发病比一九五七年约降低一半，脑炎约减少六分之一，肺结核病死率约降低五分之一。在去年工作的基础上，今年春季结合收集农肥继续大搞环境卫生，挖灭蛆蛹，扑打麻雀。最近全市人民正在展开迎接“五一”国际劳动节的卫生突击运动。
    生产需要卫生，卫生为了生产  变不利为有利，保护人民健康
    卫生工作是为生产服务的，所以首先要紧密结合生产，服从生产的需要。我们的爱国卫生运动，对于保证首都工农业生产和各项社会主义建设事业的大跃进，起了积极的作用。首都石景山钢铁厂等四十多个工矿单位，职工大搞卫生，健康水平提高，一九五八年因病缺勤率比一九五七年平均降低了约百分之三十三。北京第三通用机械厂，结合文明生产大搞卫生，形成自觉的运动，每一个车间有工人兼任安全卫生员，平时实行三趁（趁早、趁中午、趁交班）、分片包干、打扫车间；每周一小扫，每月一大扫，评比生产的同时评比卫生，先进单位插红旗。因此虽然生产繁忙而车间秩序井然，环境异常整洁。工厂特别注意职工的饮食卫生，坚持食堂的检查验收、消毒制度，去年痢疾发病率降低了约百分之九十一。一九五八年因病缺勤率比一九五七年降低了百分之五十二。一九五八年提前二十五天完成了全年跃进计划。曾被称为臭皮行的北京市皮毛三厂，以往是苍蝇成群，痢疾传播，臭气洋溢，四邻不安。经过大搞卫生运动，全厂职工下定决心“要把臭皮行变成香皮行”。他们经常保证环境、车间和个人的清洁卫生，彻底改变了“细毛满天飞，碎皮满地扔”的现象。男女职工身体健康，心情舒畅，他们创造了电力吹风，代替了有害健康用口吹毛的操作方法，提高了工作效率八倍。今年第一季度检查日产、旬产、月产都超额完成任务，产值增加百分之二十八，劳动生产率提高百分之三十一。
    广大农民结合农业生产，改进了若干农村的卫生面貌。为了“变水害为水利，变死水为活水”，把郊区一千五百九十九个水坑改造成小型水库和水渠，既可灌溉、养鱼，又能消灭蚊子的孳生。泥封堆肥的推行，去年一年中增加了优质肥料十亿多斤。今春为了适应农业生产需要，结合搞好环境卫生，全市动员扫街院、清垃圾、掏厕所、挖沟泥，聚积了大量的肥料。
    为了保护劳动力，保护人民健康，各级医疗机构组织医疗队，二十二个医院和医校派出一千二百多人，组成医疗队深入工厂、公社，进行防治疾病工作，帮助基层建立医务室，设立简易病床，协助人民公社训练“三员”（保健员、保育员、炊事员），指导城区街道和郊区公社的食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，改进卫生工作，保护儿童健康，也保证了妈妈们的生产劳动。北京第三医院医疗队深入北京第一机床厂缺勤最多的模铸车间，跟班劳动，研究发病原因，协助改进操作方法，使工人因病缺勤率迅速下降了百分之四十。
    破除思想障碍，培养卫生习惯  抓住先进典型，大鼓群众干劲
    一九五八年北京市卫生工作取得大跃进，根本是由于党和政府的正确领导，政治挂帅，贯彻了群众路线。各级党政领导抓规划、抓宣传、抓检查、发动群众，不断地掀起来群众运动的高潮。运动的深入发展，使广大人民在思想上、生活上起了很大的变化，收到了人人振奋、移风易俗的效果。在运动发展过程中，是存在着不少思想障碍的：“蚊蝇灭不尽，鼠雀偷不穷”“苍蝇蚊子是小事，值不得兴师动众”“生产工作忙不完，那有工夫讲卫生”“房子旧、破烂多，条件不好搞不了”。通过摆事实，算细账，搞展览，组织参观，开现场会等等措施，纠正了错误的思想，提高了群众的自觉，使人们深切认识到这是关系广大群众身体健康，保证生产的问题，是造福万代儿孙的事业，树立了“让麻雀上天无路，让老鼠入地无门，让蚊蝇断子绝孙”的信心和决心。抓住先进典型，发动以点带面，进行评比竞赛，就能不断地鼓舞群众学先进、赶先进、超先进的干劲；广大群众在历次战役中，党指向哪里，就走向哪里，斗志昂扬，争先恐后。灭家鼠、家家户户下鼠夹、投鼠药、搬箱倒柜堵鼠洞。灭沟鼠，一声号炮响，大家齐动员，熏了城区的四百二十公里的地沟，挖人工湖，不怕天寒地又冻，不怕冻块千斤重，工农兵学商，一齐上战场。灭麻雀，三百万人大战三天，轰、毒、打、掏，互相支援，表现了高度的集体主义精神和组织性、纪律性。群众唱出豪迈的诗句：“灭雀战役逞英豪，人民干劲冲九霄，挥旗打鼓千军动，要叫麻雀魂胆消！”
    讲卫生的习惯，在群众中也逐渐培养起来。若干先进单位基本上保持了经常的四洁（街道洁、院内洁、室内洁、厕所洁）。过去永定门外桃园居民委员会，到处堆垃圾，随手泼污水，有人说“要把卫生搞得好，除非铁树开花，马生角”，可是随着运动的展开、思想的改变，居民劳动力既全部参加了生产，又根本改变了卫生面貌。他们说“我们是又穷又白干劲大，生产卫生一枝花”。郊区永丰人民公社六里屯，去年农业生产翻一番，劳动力安排好，社员们每天下地前、收工后，打扫街道，男女老幼搞卫生，成了经常的习惯。若干人民公社的食堂，实现了既吃得好，又吃得干净的要求。南苑人民公社右安门生产站粗粮细做，细粮巧做，既营养，又卫生，人人满意。
    为了控制严重危害人民健康的传染病，北京市展开了以医务人员为骨干的群众性的防病运动。中西医在访视工作和医疗工作中密切合作，执行在党组织领导下干部、医务人员与群众相结合的方针，走出医院，下厂、下乡、下地段，发挥了为人民服务的可贵的积极性；广大群众从医务人员中得到了防病的知识，受到他们热情的感动，医务人员也受到了群众的鼓舞。夏季灭蝇防痢运动，医务人员穿街入户，边访视、边宣传、边治疗，并且带着显微镜，给群众看苍蝇，看病菌，增强了宣传教育的效果。冬季防治麻疹，他们提出“病人不出门，医药送到家”的口号。在城区划分了一百二十四个防病地段，一千一百三十多位医务人员分片包干，把住了防病第一线。由于经过整风运动，医务人员提高了政治觉悟和对人民的责任感。有一个医生到一个病儿家中访视，达四十一次之多，直到康复为止，有一个公社的医生，抢救一个转肺炎的病儿，亲自守护三昼夜。多少个医院的医生、护士，废寝忘餐，千方百计，抢救危重病儿，不少人输出自己的鲜血进行急救，多少妈妈流了感动的眼泪。许多动人的事例，表现了我们医务人员崇高的共产主义风格。
    突击与经常相结合，治标与治本相结合，群众运动与技术措施相结合
    我们采取了三种相结合的工作方法，增加了除四害讲卫生消灭疾病的战斗力量。第一、突击与经常相结合。突击的效果是提高，经常的作用是巩固。根据四害生活规律，疾病流行情况，结合人民习惯，在一年中举行若干次全市性的突击，规定目标，集中力量，可以取得巨大的战果。在突击后又必须能建立制度，养成习惯，坚持经常性的工作，才能把突击的战果巩固提高，突击和经常，必须更番连续，形成波浪式的运动。第二、治标与治本相结合。四害数量多、繁殖快，必须采用综合措施反复歼灭。对老鼠采取的是打、毒、堵、熏；对麻雀是轰、毒、打、掏；对蚊蝇是扑打、烟熏、药物喷洒。并且要适应季节“打早、打小、打了”。为了除尽灭绝，还要采取治本的办法。对苍蝇，要改造厕所，处理粪便；对蚊子要翻盆倒罐，处理积水。治标、治本，缺一不可。第三、群众运动与技术措施相结合。除害灭病主要靠大搞群众运动，但也必须有技术措施来加强它的效果，并且要把简单易行的技术措施逐步使群众自己掌握起来。
    我们的卫生工作取得成绩是和各方面的互相支援协作分不开的。首先是坚决执行了“块块负责、条条贯彻”。这样一种条块相结合的工作方法，城郊各区既能加强统一领导，各条条系统也能发挥推动作用。不少中央机关和驻京部队，既经常搞好自己的卫生工作，又积极支援地方群众的突击运动，在群众中起了带头的作用。此外，我们向各兄弟省市学习先进经验和受到他们的鼓舞支援，也都是对我们的促进力量。
    坚持不懈，反复斗争，继续跃进争上游
    一九五九年的新形势，给爱国卫生运动带来了新的要求。首都今年的工农业生产、城市建设都要有更大、更好、更全面的跃进，生产劳动越紧张，就越需要保证劳动大军的健康；新的形势要求进一步贯彻卫生为生产服务的方针。农村人民公社普遍建立公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业，新的形势要求密切关心群众生活，把集体生活中的卫生工作做好。今年是我国伟大国庆的十周年，首都人民同全国各地一样，都要以出色的劳动成就，来迎接大典。进一步消灭更多的四害，大力减少主要的疾病，以一个整洁清新的城市向国庆十周年献礼，是首都人民共同的愿望。
    虽然过去一年中北京市卫生工作取得了不少的成绩，但也存在着不少的问题。四害还没有除尽灭绝，只要有孳生条件，就会乘隙繁殖、回升；群众的卫生习惯还没有普遍养成或不能巩固，工作任务的艰巨性是很明显的。可是，有党和政府的正确领导，有一九五八年成功的经验，有全市人民朝气蓬勃的冲天干劲，都是有利的条件。只要坚持贯彻群众路线，卫生工作人员同群众相结合，中西医相结合，经常不懈，反复斗争，鼓足干劲，力争上游，北京市一九五九年的爱国卫生运动一定能够取得更大的跃进。
    中国内政决不许外国干涉，西藏永远是中国的西藏各位代表：
    我完全同意各位代表对西藏问题的发言，坚决拥护中央政府对西藏地方的政策方针，以及彻底肃清残余叛匪的坚决措施。西藏是中国领土，这是从古至今举世皆知的事。西藏叛乱分子挟持达赖喇嘛逃往印度，印度是和中国和平共处的邻邦，竟然有印度外交官员散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，一批扩张主义分子肆意叫嚣诬蔑，挑拨煽动，明显地要破坏中国的统一，分裂中国民族的团结。甚至还发生了污辱中国人民伟大领袖毛主席像的事情，这实在使全中国人不能容忍，我认为印度政府面对着这种情况，应当感到自己对友好邻邦中国应负的责任。我在这里对印度扩张主义者表示极大的愤怒；对印度当局提出忠告，要求印度当局珍视中印两国的友谊，严格遵守和平共处的五项原则，对印度境内存在着的破坏中国领土主权的阴谋活动，不能不采取应有的措施，中国人民决不允许帝国主义和外国反动派破坏中国统一、民族团结的阴谋得逞。他们的狂妄企图一定会在中国人民面前遭到可耻的失败。
    我要在这里大声疾呼：中国的内政永远不容许外国干涉！西藏永远是中国的西藏！
