Developing Pastoral Resources to Prosper the Economy of All Ethnic Groups
Yuan Renyuan, Secretary of the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee and Governor of Qinghai Province

"Qinghai is vast and rich in resources, a very lovable place in the motherland." This is what Vice Chairman Zhu De said when he praised Qinghai's vastness and abundance of resources during his visit last year. These words are filled with love for Qinghai and great hope for its future, bringing great encouragement and strength to cadres at all levels and people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai. Indeed, Qinghai is a very lovable place in the motherland. On this vast land of 820,000 square kilometers, there are not only rich agricultural resources, but also unlimited potential in industry, especially in the pastoral areas, which account for more than 97% of the province's area and have great potential.

People who have not been to pastoral areas may think that pastoral areas only have grasslands and cattle and sheep. This is mainly because they have not been to pastoral areas and do not understand the situation. Qinghai's pastoral areas have more than 800 million mu of grassland that can be utilized, most of which are lush with water and grass. If slightly improved, the carrying capacity can be increased four to five times on the existing basis. Animal husbandry is a major aspect of production development in pastoral areas and accounts for a large proportion of the national economy. However, the resources of pastoral areas are multifaceted. In terms of industry, geological personnel have discovered more than 1,100 mineral deposits of copper, iron, lead, zinc, borax, petroleum, coal, gold, silver, salt, alkali, etc. in some areas in recent years, of which more than 300 have industrial mining value. In agriculture, there are about 30 million mu of arable land, and the soil is fertile and the water source is abundant, suitable for planting wheat, highland barley and other food crops. Last year, grain and vegetables were successfully trial-planted in Yushu, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and other places, and the harvest was good. In addition, there are also precious medicinal materials such as pilose antler, musk, rhubarb, caterpillar fungus, fritillaria, and rare birds and animals such as snow leopards, lynx, and swans, some of which enjoy a high reputation in domestic and foreign markets.

Although Qinghai's pastoral areas have such abundant resources, these rich resources have never been utilized and developed due to the cruel exploitation by the feudal ruling class and the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma bandit gangs. There is no industry here at all. Although there is a small amount of agriculture, the output is very low due to backward farming technology. Even animal husbandry production has been severely damaged. At the time of liberation in 1949, there were only 7.15 million head of livestock in the entire province, a decrease of more than 40% compared with 1937, and the lives of the vast number of herders were in a very difficult situation.

In the past few years since liberation, under the kind concern and correct leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao, the Party and government leaders at all levels in Qinghai Province have carried out a series of arduous tasks in pastoral areas in a step-by-step manner, correctly implemented the ethnic policies, trained a large number of ethnic minority cadres, vigorously built roads to develop transportation, issued a large number of loans, reasonably adjusted and increased the purchase prices of livestock products, established many state-owned farms, ranches, breeding farms, and animal disease prevention and control institutions, and vigorously supported herders to develop production. In 1958, after the socialist revolution in pastoral areas, the people's commune system was realized, which fundamentally destroyed the feudal rule of the reactionary herdbosses that had lasted for thousands of years, greatly strengthened ethnic unity, and further liberated the productive forces. The laboring herders began to implement settled rotational grazing. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also made great progress, and many social welfare facilities have been established. The spiritual outlook of the vast number of herders has been completely renewed, and their enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. The face of the pastoral areas is changing with each passing day.

The future of the pastoral areas is very bright. Although the current situation has changed greatly and is changing rapidly, it is undeniable that it is still relatively backward in some aspects. Therefore, how to further vigorously develop and build pastoral areas is a very important issue. Now the Provincial Party Committee has determined the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations" in pastoral areas, which is comprehensive and correct. The implementation of this policy will play a decisive role in the prosperity of the economy of all ethnic groups in Qinghai.

With the development of the entire pastoral area, accelerating the change of the economic face of the pastoral area has become the strong desire of the herders. To completely change the face of the pastoral area, it is necessary to give full play to and rely on the high political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the herders, and vigorously carry out mass movements centered on animal husbandry to ensure a net increase of 24.7% in various livestock within the year. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously combine agriculture and animal husbandry, mobilize the herders to reclaim a large amount of wasteland, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency in grain and feed in 1960. Developing agricultural production is an active measure to change the economic face of pastoral areas. This is not only of great significance for meeting the food needs of the herders, but also can establish a solid feed and forage base, which will play an important role in the stable and rapid development of animal husbandry. In addition, it is also necessary to use the natural resources of the pastoral areas to actively develop various industries, vigorously develop sideline production, and continuously improve and improve the living standards of the herders. In recent years, the transportation industry in pastoral areas has made great progress, but due to the vast area, transportation in some places is still inconvenient. In order to ensure the smooth completion of various construction undertakings in pastoral areas, road construction should also be vigorously carried out this year. At present, the Party and government cadres at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas are making unremitting efforts to accelerate the socialist construction of pastoral areas.

Pastoral areas are vast and sparsely populated, with a lack of labor force and a weak production base. Although the development and construction of pastoral areas should mainly rely on the self-reliance of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai, support from all parts of the country is also a major force. In recent years, all brother provinces (cities) have given our province great support in terms of human, material, and technical resources, which has a significant impact on the development of pastoral areas and the promotion of the economic and cultural prosperity of all ethnic groups.

Strengthening the Party's leadership and vigorously carrying out mass movements are always the fundamental guarantees for all tasks, and also the fundamental guarantees for the development and construction of pastoral areas. We are convinced that as long as we resolutely implement the general line of socialist construction, unite the people of all ethnic groups, adhere to the principle of combining revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit, and continue to work hard, diligently, and cleverly, it can be expected that in the near future, we will be able to build this very lovable place in Qinghai into a socialist paradise with granaries and meat depots, factories and schools standing in great numbers, transportation and postal communications forming a network, and flourishing culture.

　　开发牧区资源繁荣各族人民经济
　　中共青海省委书记青海省省长  袁任远
    “青海地大物博，是祖国的一个十分可爱的地方。”这是去年朱德副主席来到青海以后在赞扬青海地大物博时所说的一句话。这句话充满着对青海的热爱和对它的未来所寄予的莫大希望，给青海的各级党政干部和各族人民带来了极大的鼓舞和力量。的确，青海是祖国的一块十分可爱的地方。在这幅员辽阔面积达八十二万平方公里的土地上，不仅有着富饶的农业资源，而且在工业上还有着无限的潜在力量，特别是占全省面积97％以上的牧业区，更是大有可为。
    没有到过牧业区的人们，以为牧业区似乎唯一的就是草地和牛羊，这主要是由于没有到过牧业区，对牧业区的情况不了解所致。青海牧业区可资利用的草原有八亿多亩，大都水草丰美，如果稍加改良，就可以在现有的基础上提高载畜量四到五倍。畜牧业是牧业区生产发展的一个主要方面，在国民经济中占有很大比重。但是，牧业区的资源是多方面的，在工业上，仅经地质人员近年来在部分地区的勘察，就发现了铜、铁、铅、锌、硼砂、石油、煤炭、金、银、盐、碱等各种矿点一千一百多个，其中具有工业开采价值的达三百多处。在农业上，约有三千万亩可垦荒地，而且土壤肥沃，水源充沛，宜于种植小麦、青稞等各种粮食作物。去年，在玉树、果洛藏族自治州等地，粮食和蔬菜就已经试种成功，并且收获良好。此外，在这里还有着鹿茸、麝香、大黄、冬虫草、贝母等名贵药材和扫雪、猞猁、天鹅等珍禽异兽，有些并在国内外市场上享有盛名。
    青海牧业区虽然有如此丰富的资源，但是由于历代封建统治阶级和蒋、马匪帮施行残酷剥削的结果，这些富饶的资源，从来没有利用和开发。这里根本没有工业，虽然有一小块农业，由于耕作技术落后，产量很低，就是畜牧业生产也遭受到严重的破坏。1949年解放时，全省仅有各种牲畜七百一十五万头，比起1937年还减少了40％以上，广大牧民群众的生活处于十分贫困的境地。
    解放几年来，在中央和毛主席的殷切关怀和正确领导下，青海省各级党政领导在牧业区有步骤地进行了一系列的艰巨工作，正确贯彻执行了民族政策，培养了大批民族干部，大力修筑公路发展交通运输，发放了大批贷款，合理调整和提高了畜产品的收购价格，建立了许多国营农场、牧场、种畜场以及兽疫防治机构，大力扶助牧民发展生产。1958年，在牧业区，经过社会主义革命，实现了人民公社化，从根本上摧毁了几千年来反动牧主头人的封建统治，大大增强了民族团结，生产力就得到了进一步解放。劳动牧民开始实行了定居轮牧。文化教育卫生事业也有了很大进步，并且建立了许多社会福利设施，广大牧民的精神状态焕然一新，生产积极性空前高涨。牧业区的面貌正在日新月异地变化着。
    牧业区的远景是十分美好的。虽然现在情况已有很大改变和正在迅速改变。但是，不可否认，在某些方面还是比较落后的。因此，如何进一步大力开发和建设牧业区是一个十分重要的问题。现在省委在牧业区确定“以牧为主，农牧结合，开展多种经营”的方针，是全面的正确的。这个方针的贯彻，将对青海各族人民经济的繁荣起着决定性的作用。
    随着整个牧业区形势的发展，加速改变牧业区的经济面貌，已成为当前牧民群众的强烈愿望。要彻底改变牧业区的面貌，就要充分发挥和依靠牧民群众的高度政治热情和生产积极性，大搞以畜牧业为中心的群众运动，保证各种牲畜年内净增24.7％。同时，必须大搞农牧结合，发动牧民群众大量开垦荒地，争取在1960年达到粮食、饲料自给。发展农业生产是改变牧业区经济面貌的一项积极措施。这不仅对满足牧民群众的粮食需要有着极其重要的意义，还可以建立巩固的饲料、饲草基地，对于稳定地高速发展畜牧业将起重要作用。此外，还要利用牧业区的天然资源积极发展各种工业，大搞副业生产，不断改善和提高牧民生活水平。几年来，牧业区的交通运输事业有很大发展，但由于地域辽阔，有些地方交通还不方便。为了保证牧业区各项建设事业的顺利完成，今年还应大搞公路建设。目前，牧业区的各级党政干部和各族人民一起，正在不懈地为加速牧业区的社会主义建设而奋斗。
    牧业区地广人稀，劳动力缺乏，生产基础薄弱，开发和建设牧业区虽然主要应依靠青海各族人民的自力更生，但是来自全国各地的支援也是一支重大力量。近年来，各兄弟省（市）无论在人力、物力以及技术等方面都给我省以极大的支援，这对开发牧业区，促进各民族经济、文化的繁荣，有着重大的影响。
    加强党的领导和大搞群众运动，永远是各项工作的根本保证，同样也是开发和建设牧业区的根本保证。我们确信：只要坚决贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，团结各族人民群众，坚持革命热情和科学精神相结合的原则，继续实干、苦干、巧干，可以预期：在不久的日子里，就一定能够把青海这一块十分可爱的地方建设成为一个粮仓肉仓、工厂学校林立、交通邮电成网、文化昌盛的社会主义乐园。
