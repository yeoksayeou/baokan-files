Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I am honored to participate in the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and I also attended the National People's Congress (NPC) as a non-voting delegate. I was excited to hear Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Chairman Li Weihan's CPPCC work report, Director Li Fuchun's report on the national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state budget and final accounts, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the NPC Standing Committee. These reports were profoundly enlightening and educational for me, and I feel greatly encouraged. I express my heartfelt support.

Under the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have made unprecedented achievements, transforming our country's backwardness of "poverty and blankness" for thousands of years, and striding forward towards socialism and communism. Especially in the extraordinary year of last year, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the whole nation was full of vigor. Not only did industry and agriculture leap forward, but also culture, education, health, science and technology, commerce, transportation, and other fields advanced simultaneously. Moreover, people's mental outlook has also undergone great changes. This comprehensive Great Leap Forward is not accidental. We deeply understand that it is due to the correct leadership of the Party and the superiority of the socialist system. On the basis of the victory of the nationwide rectification campaign, the broad masses of people have been inspired by the General Line, their socialist consciousness has been further enhanced, and their labor enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high, thus launching a vigorous Great Leap Forward. In the future, on the basis of summarizing experience, there will surely be more, greater, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forwards. At the same time, we further realize that the Party is the core force leading the Chinese people, and without the leadership of the Party, no cause can possibly succeed.

Under the encouragement and impetus of this situation, members of the Anhui Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA), like members of the two associations across the country, feel that the situation is pressing and realize that they must further strengthen self-transformation. However, although most of us have made varying degrees of progress in self-transformation after the education of the rectification campaign and participation in labor training, from all aspects, most people still have dual personalities and are still far from the working people. In particular, the weariness of transformation exists to varying degrees and is quite widespread. This weariness of transformation is not only incompatible with the rapid development of the country, but also a countercurrent on the road of self-transformation for us industrialists and businessmen. It has its corrosiveness and tendency to spread. If it is not overcome in time, it will inevitably hinder our self-transformation; hinder us from better serving the socialist cause. Its development is very dangerous and cannot but arouse our serious vigilance. Therefore, in January of this year, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the CDNCA, under the leadership and care of the Party, convened a joint meeting. Through discussion, they unanimously recognized the harm of weariness of transformation and admitted that fundamental transformation must continue to be strengthened. From here, I deeply thank the Party for giving us unparalleled care and warmth. Whenever we are at a critical juncture, the Party timely extends a warm hand to guide us onto the right track. Since liberation, the Party's application of the policy of peaceful redemption of national capitalists, embodies its warmth and care everywhere, so the people in our industrial and commercial circles feel more and more cheerful and lively every day, which fully proves the complete correctness of the peaceful redemption policy.

Of course, we still need to continue to carry out fundamental transformation under the education and help of the Party. Take myself, for example. After the heart-to-heart talk, I also felt complacent and thought that the transformation was almost complete. This emotion is a manifestation of weariness of transformation—no need for transformation. Is it really unnecessary to transform? No. Because the old poisons are too deeply infected, thorough transformation is still a very arduous process. For example, the working people are all working hard and happily. Especially when the worker comrades accept tasks, they always muster up energy and drill deeply, trying every means to overcome difficulties and overfulfill tasks. But when I accept tasks, I always consider this and that, afraid of taking the first step, and have many concerns. Compared with the working people's energy and drive, it is far behind. When the iron and steel movement was in full swing last year, although I also ate with the worker comrades, from the phenomenon, I achieved "eating together", but ideologically, I felt that such eating was not nutritious enough, and I always wanted to get more meat dishes to supplement nutrition when I came home; when the people's commune movement started, although I also believed that the Party's leadership would surely lead us to a happier road, because the big and public nature of the people's commune impacted my small and private nature, so I also had some incorrect concerns, such as thinking that the commune should distribute according to work, my labor is not as good as others, and I have no technical expertise, I am afraid to reduce life; worrying that the supply part is more than the wage part, and the pocket money is not enough, and so on. These incorrect concerns of mine are far from the enthusiasm of the working people, who are wholeheartedly and enthusiastically welcoming the people's communes. Just giving the above examples shows whether my political stance problem does not need to continue to carry out fundamental transformation?

Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "All our achievements are created by the united strength of all patriotic people in our country. In the past, we united all those who could be united; in the future, we will continue to do so." "Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, unite closely, and use active actions to complete and overfulfill the 1959 plan to greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland—the People's Republic of China." This instruction touched me deeply and greatly encouraged me. What is touching is: I am a member of the People's Republic of China, I feel honored, I feel that I have this glorious task. What is encouraging is: the beautiful prospect greatly encourages our confidence and determination to strengthen self-transformation. Specifically to our industrial and commercial circles, an important task at present is the issue of combining transformation and service. If we combine strengthening transformation and actively serving well, give play to our role, contribute more to the country, and benefit individual transformation, it is to support Premier Zhou's call with active actions.

In Anhui, some industrialists and businessmen lack a correct understanding of the relationship between transformation and service. They only want to be practical and do not want to be theoretical, thinking that it is enough to do a good job in business in the enterprise. Of course, doing a good job in business is one aspect, but it is impossible to imagine that people who have not solved their political thoughts can serve the socialist cause well. We believe that transformation and service are equal to walking on two legs, both are indispensable. Strengthening transformation and actively serving is the process of "establishing the middle and breaking the old" for us industrialists and businessmen. Actively serving to promote transformation, and strengthening transformation as a driving force to promote oneself to actively serve socialism. In this way, we can continuously give play to our positive side and overcome our negative side in transformation and service, and make more contributions to the socialist cause. I deeply feel that the more transformation, the more service, the bad transformation, the bad service, and the impossible to serve the socialist cause without transformation.

The above is my superficial understanding of "transformation and service", which is of course very incomplete.

Premier Zhou pointed out: "The general characteristic of the current international situation is the rapid development of socialist forces, national independence movements, and other peace-loving forces, while the imperialist policies of aggression and war are in great difficulty. As Chairman Mao said: 'The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day'." This situation is greatly beneficial to the peace-loving people of the world. The unlucky ones are only a small handful of imperialist war mongers. We feel very excited. However, we must remain vigilant as long as imperialism exists. The anti-imperialist struggle is also our main task at present. I firmly express that, under the leadership of the Party, through the path of political and ideological transformation as the commander, labor and practice as the foundation, and the job post as the base, we will combine transformation and service, actively contribute to the socialist cause, and support the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies with practical actions; to welcome the great tenth anniversary of the National Day.

The above is my speech. If there are any inappropriate points, please criticize and correct me.

Finally, I wish all committee members and comrades good health!

    工商业者必须加强改造
    孙友樵委员谈改造和服务的关系主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我光荣地参加了全国政协会议，同时，又列席了全国人民代表大会，兴奋地听到了周总理所作的政府工作报告、李维汉副主席所作的政协工作报告，李富春主任关于国民经济计划的报告，李先念副总理关于国家预算决算的报告，彭真副委员长关于人大常委会的工作报告。以上一系列的报告给我启发、教育极为深刻，并感到莫大的鼓舞，我表示衷心拥护。
    我国人民，在党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，作出了前人从来没做过、甚至想也没有想过的丰功伟绩，大大改变了我国千百年来“一穷二白”的落后面貌，迈着巨人的步伐，向着社会主义、共产主义挺进。特别是不平常的去年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全民干劲冲天，不仅工业、农业飞跃进展，文教、卫生、科学技术、商业、交通等方面，齐头并进，而且人们的精神面貌，亦有很大的改变。这种全面大跃进，不是偶然的，我们深深体会到这都是由于：党的领导正确和社会主义制度的优越性。广大群众，在全民整风运动胜利的基础上，受到了总路线的鼓舞，社会主义觉悟更加提高，劳动热情空前高涨，因而轰轰烈烈地掀起了大跃进的高潮。今后在总结经验的基础上，一定不断地更多、更大、更全面的大跃进。同时我们进一步认识到党是领导中国人民的核心力量，一切事业，如果没有党的领导，肯定是不可能成功的。
    在这样形势的鼓舞和推动下，我们安徽省的民建和工商联两会成员，亦与全国各地两会成员一样，感到形势逼人，认识到非进一步加强自我改造不可。但是我们中间多数人，虽然经过整风运动的教育和参加劳动锻炼，在自我改造方面有了不同程度的进步，但从各方面来看，多数人两面性依然存在，和劳动人民之间还有很大距离，尤其是对改造的厌倦情绪不同程度地、相当普遍地存在着。这种厌倦改造情绪，不仅与国家一日千里飞跃进展的形势不相适应，而且是我们工商业者自我改造前进道路上的一股逆流，有其腐蚀性和泛滥性，如不及时加以克服，必然要阻碍我们的自我改造；阻碍我们更好地为社会主义事业服务，发展下去，十分危险，不能不引起我们严重的警惕。因此，今年一月我们全国工商联和民建中央，在党的领导和关怀下，召开了联席会议，通过务虚，一致认识到厌倦改造的危害性，并承认必须继续加强根本的改造。从这里我深深感谢党给我们无比的关怀和温暖，每当我们紧要关头，党就及时地伸出了温暖的手，引导我们走上正轨。解放以来，党对我们民族工商业者和平改造政策的运用，随处体现他的温暖和关怀，所以我们工商界中人，一天一天的感到心情舒畅，生动活泼，这就充分证明了和平改造政策的完全正确。
    当然，我们还需要在党的教育和帮助下，继续进行根本的改造。就拿我个人来讲，在交心以后，亦感到自满，以为改造得差不多了。这种情绪，也就是厌倦改造——不需要改造的表现，事实上是不是不需要改造呢？不是的。由于旧的毒素感染太深，彻底改造，尚是一个很艰巨的过程，如：劳动人民，都在紧张而愉快地进行辛勤的劳动，特别是工人同志接受任务时，总是鼓足干劲和钻劲，千方百计地克服困难，超额完成任务，而我接受任务时，总是考虑这个，考虑那个，畏首畏尾，顾虑多端，比之劳动人民的干劲和钻劲，差得很远；去年大搞钢铁运动时，我虽然亦是与工人同志一同吃饭，从现象看，是做到了“同吃”，但思想上觉得这样吃，营养不够，回家来总要多搞点荤菜来补充营养；在人民公社运动开始时，虽然我亦相信党领导我们一定走向更幸福的道路，但是，由于人民公社的大和公，冲击着我的小和私，因而亦有些不正确的顾虑，如：认为公社要按劳分配，自己劳动力不及别人，而又无技术专长，怕要降低生活；顾虑供给部分多于工资部分，零用钱不够等等。我这些不正确的顾虑，与劳动人民的一心一意欢欣鼓舞，迎接人民公社的热情相比，又是差得很远的。仅仅举出以上几个例子，就说明了我的政治立场问题，是不是不需要继续进行根本的改造呢？
    周总理报告中指出：“我们的一切成就是我国全体爱国人民团结一致的力量创造的。在过去，我们团结了一切能够团结的人；在今后，我们也将继续这样做。”“让我们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导下，紧密地团结起来，用完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，来迎接我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年”。这一指示，更使我深受感动，深受鼓舞。感动的是：我是中华人民共和国的一分子，我感到光荣，我感到有这个光荣的任务。鼓舞的是：美丽的前景，大大鼓舞了我们加强自我改造的信心和决心。具体到我们工商界来讲，摆在当前一个重要的课题，就是改造与服务相结合的问题，我们如果把加强改造和积极服务很好的结合起来，发挥作用，对国家贡献更多，对个人改造有利，也就是以积极行动来拥护周总理的号召了。
    我们安徽，有些工商业者，对改造与服务的关系问题，还缺乏正确的认识，他们只愿务实，不愿务虚，以为只要在企业搞好业务就够了，当然，搞好业务是一方面，但不可能设想政治思想没有解决的人，而能够很好的为社会主义事业服务。我们认为改造与服务等于两条腿走路，缺一不可。加强改造积极服务，是我们工商业者“立中破”的过程。积极服务来推动改造，又以加强改造为动力，推动自己积极为社会主义服务。这样，就可以在改造与服务中，不断发挥自己积极的一面，克服自己消极的一面，为社会主义事业作出更多的贡献。我深深地感到：改造多一分，就服务多一分，改造不好，就服务不好，不改造就根本不可能为社会主义事业服务。
    上面是我对“改造与服务”的肤浅认识，当然是很不全面的。
    周总理指出：“目前国际形势总的特点，就是社会主义的力量、民族独立运动的力量和其他爱好和平的力量迅速发展，而帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策则陷入重重困难之中。正如毛主席所说：“敌人在一天天烂下去，我们在一天天好起来”。这一形势大大有利于全世界爱好和平的人民，倒霉的仅是一小撮帝国主义战争贩子，我们感到十分兴奋。但是，帝国主义存在一天，我们都必须保持警惕。反帝斗争，亦是我们当前主要任务，我坚决表示，在党的领导下，通过以政治思想改造为统帅，以劳动和实践为基础，以工作岗位为基地的途径，把改造和服务结合起来，积极为社会主义事业贡献力量，以实际行动来支援反对国内外敌人的斗争；来迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    以上我的发言，不妥当的地方，请同志们予以批评指正。
    最后，祝各位委员，各位同志身体健康！
