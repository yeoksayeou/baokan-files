Chongqing Industry in Full Bloom
Speech by Representative Liao Suhua

Mr. Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the various reports of the conference. I would now like to make the following remarks on the industrial situation in Chongqing.

In 1958, thanks to the great victory of the Rectification Campaign and the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for building socialism, under the direct leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee, Chongqing achieved great successes in industrial production. Steel production fulfilled and overfulfilled the state plan ahead of schedule, an increase of 78.58 percent compared to 1957. The output of machine tools and electric motors increased more than sixfold compared to 1957, and generators increased more than eightfold compared to 1957. Other industrial products also had huge increases. This year, 4,564 new products were successfully trial-produced, including rolling mills, jeeps, trucks, tractors, copper-containing steel rails, seamless steel pipes, reactive dyes, chlorobutyl rubber, etc. Many products that were previously considered impossible to manufacture have now been manufactured. The quality of general products has also greatly improved, and the quality of many products has reached advanced levels at home and abroad.

In 1958, many new technologies were adopted and many advanced experiences were promoted in various industries in the city, such as double-bagging steel tapping, double-notch steel tapping, three-notch steel tapping, step-by-step charging, mixed steelmaking and rapid kiln firing in the steel industry; multi-tool multi-edge, multi-clamp "living," multi-process, multi-machine tool management, and "ants gnawing bones" in the machinery industry; multi-cycle operation, hydraulic mining, shield support mining, and methane extraction in the coal industry; non-stop power maintenance and remote operation in the power industry; double-row spindles, centrifugal spindles, double-layer weaving, electrostatic flocking, and electrostatic spinning in the textile industry; rapid railway locomotive inspection and washing, truck trailerization, and electric navigation marks in transportation, as well as rapid construction in capital construction, etc. These new technologies and advanced experiences are blooming flowers under the sunshine of the General Line, bearing the fruitful results of the great leap forward in industrial production in 1958.

The experience of 1958 proves that only a great leap forward in thinking can promote a great leap forward in production.

The great victory on Chongqing's industrial front in 1958 fully demonstrates the complete correctness of the Party's General Line, and fully demonstrates the complete correctness of the principle of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, the principle of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements, and the whole set of principles of "walking on two legs." It vividly illustrates that once the working class and all the people break superstitions, liberate their minds, they can unleash tremendous wisdom and infinite power, and create many miracles that many people could not have imagined in the past.

The great victory of Chongqing's industrial production in 1958 was the result of vigorously launching mass movements and making great efforts in technical revolution under the leadership of the Party. The movement was roughly divided into three stages. The development of each movement always started with political movements and ideological leaps forward, from political upsurges to production upsurges, and from ideological leaps forward to production leaps forward. The entire mass movement was always full of revolutionary spirit and advanced ideas, constantly pushing it to new heights. In the first stage, taking advantage of the victory of the Rectification Campaign, the "three winds" and "five airs" were swept away, outdated rules and regulations were broken down, cadres participated in labor, and workers participated in management, fundamentally improving the internal production relations and cadre-mass relations of socialist enterprises. The sense of responsibility of the working masses as masters was greatly enhanced, and communist ideas were greatly promoted. A set of socialist enterprise management systems conducive to production development was gradually established. In the second stage, the reform of rules and regulations moved to technical innovation, greatly changing process regulations and operating methods. In terms of political ideology, the education of the General Line was carried out vigorously, advocating breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, and promoting the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. The political enthusiasm of the working masses soared to unprecedented heights, and the tide of technical revolution surged forward. Everyone competed to be all-rounders, implemented multi-machine tool management, and creations and inventions emerged one after another. Advanced figures emerged continuously. Productive forces developed rapidly. The production efficiency of some types of work increased by several times, dozens of times, even hundreds or thousands of times. In the third stage, the large-scale mass steelmaking campaign drove a greater leap forward in machinery production. In the mass steelmaking campaign, more than one million people in the city, men and women, old and young, all threw themselves into the battle. "To turn steel water into sea water, to turn the mountain city into a steel city" became the battle cry of the whole people. The nationwide political and production movement stimulated the political enthusiasm of machinery workers even more. At the same time, it placed greater demands on the machinery industry. In the face of urgent tasks and insufficient raw materials, it prompted the in-depth development of technical revolution to revolutionize the machines. From reforming the parts of the machines to transforming the entire machine's design, structure, and manufacturing, to make it more scientific and more applicable, hundreds of types of thousands of simple machines were manufactured in one quarter, rapidly strengthening the machinery and equipment and increasing the capacity of machine production. These three stages deepened step by step and combined with each other. The wisdom of the working masses shone brightly. A total of 8.36 million innovation proposals were put forward throughout the year. Under the leadership of the Party, the "Industrial Constitution" of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" was gradually implemented and became the basis for launching mass movements and making great efforts in technical revolution in industrial and mining enterprises.

In the process of Chongqing's great leap forward in industrial production in 1958, there was absolutely no struggle. In fact, the process of the great leap forward in 1958 was the process of establishing the revolutionary idea of striving for high speed, opposing conservative ideas, and also the process of struggle between the two lines and two ideologies of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and "less, slower, worse, and more expensive." In the struggle, we refuted the "skeptics," criticized conservative ideas, and achieved victory. Those who held skeptical and wait-and-see attitudes about whether we could achieve a great leap forward have already lost everything in the face of the facts. But the struggle has not ended. When we proposed to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959, those who believed that the production potential had been exhausted, the "production has reached its peak" theorists, showed their heads again. Their argument also does not stand up.

The Great Leap Forward in 1958 laid a solid foundation for continuing the Great Leap Forward this year.

The great leap forward in Chongqing's industrial production in 1958 is not only reflected in the multiple increase in industrial products, but also gave us very favorable conditions, laying a solid foundation for continuing the great leap forward this year, so that this year's greater leap forward has a higher and broader starting point. The great leap forward in 1958 greatly changed the production appearance of industrial and mining enterprises and improved the production level of enterprises; it trained and strengthened the ranks of the working class, the communist consciousness and communist style of the working class were greatly promoted, they mastered many new technologies, and more than 100,000 advanced producers emerged; and it further changed the face of the city, gradually changing the past consumer city into a production city. Hundreds of thousands of street residents and family members of employees participated in production, and it has already achieved "everyone has work, every household has no idlers"; particularly important is that through this great practice in 1958, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we not only found a broad road to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, but also gained rich experience on this broad road. With all this, it not only enables us to continue the great leap forward in 1959, but also has the possibility to leap forward even better.

The facts are also true. Not long after 1959 began, Chongqing's industrial production, like that of other parts of the country, quickly set off a new production upsurge. On the basis of the victory in 1958, Chongqing's working class advanced victoriously, lashed the horse and spurred it on, eliminated the many difficulties on the road forward, and won the victory in the first quarter. Compared with the same period last year, steel and coal have both increased several times. This fact is a powerful refutation to those who hold a skeptical attitude towards this year's greater leap forward.

In the process of further greater leap forward in production, Chongqing's industrial production encountered difficulties such as insufficient raw materials, electricity, coking coal, and transportation. But these material difficulties, these difficulties in the process of advancing, have always been "no problem" for the working class. In the face of difficulties, they exerted soaring energy and tenacious fighting spirit, made great efforts in technical revolution, and constantly overcame difficulties to continue the leap forward. Not only that, but difficulties tempered the working class, enabling them to learn a lot of skills to overcome difficulties and gain rich spiritual wealth. In achieving a greater leap forward in steel production this year, Chongqing steel workers encountered the difficulty of high sulfur content in pig iron. They concentrated their efforts to launch a mining campaign and created a set of effective methods to surround and suppress sulfur from the material yard to the iron-making furnace and the steel-making furnace, and finally turned the local iron with a sulfur content of up to 0.4 percent into qualified foreign steel.

The experience of the great leap forward in 1958 proves that the fundamental method for a great leap forward in production in factories and mines is to launch mass movements and make great efforts in technical revolution. In 1959, when achieving a greater leap forward, this experience not only needs to be continued, but also needs to be continuously developed. Since this year, the mass movement on Chongqing's industrial front has been continuing to advance along this direction. In February this year, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company created the experience of organizing production in a vertical and horizontal "one-dragon" within the enterprise. On this basis, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized departments closely related to steel production, such as coking coal, machinery, electricity, capital construction, and transportation, to carry out a joint competition with steel as the key link, forming a large-scale mass movement of "one-dragon" inside and outside the enterprise, making the inside and outside of the enterprise a whole, promoting each other, promoting each other, and creating a new and greater production upsurge.

Starting in the second quarter, a mass movement with high output and high quality as the goal and technical revolution as the center is rapidly unfolding in various factories and mining enterprises in Chongqing. At the same time, a mass-scale movement of great blooming and contending with improving the level of enterprise management as the center is also unfolding fiercely. It can be predicted that on this basis, the production upsurge that has already formed will be pushed to a greater peak.

Since the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the notice to convene the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers, "Create new achievements, strive to go to Beijing" has become the action slogan of the vast number of workers in Chongqing. The Chongqing working class will never live up to the expectations of the Party and the government. They are working hard to create outstanding production achievements to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Day, and strive to come to the capital of the motherland to see our dear leader Chairman Mao.

The above speech is for your criticism and correction.

    重庆工业春花怒放
    廖苏华代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意大会的各项报告，现就重庆市工业方面的一些情况，作以下发言。
    一九五八年，由于整风运动的伟大胜利和党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀，在中共四川省委和省人民委员会的直接领导下，重庆市的工业生产取得巨大的成就。钢产量提前和超额完成了国家计划，比一九五七年增长了百分之七十八点五八，机床和电动机的产量比一九五七年增长了六倍多，发电机比一九五七年增长了八倍多。其他工业产品也有巨大的增长。今年试制成功的新产品达四千五百六十四种，其中有轧钢机、吉普车、载重汽车、拖拉机、含铜钢轨、无缝钢管、活性染料，氯酊橡胶等等，许多过去认为不能制造的产品，现在已经制造出来了。一般产品的质量也有很大的提高，不少产品的质量已经达到了国内外先进的水平。
    一九五八年在市的各个产业中，都采用了许多新的技术，推广了许多先进经验，如炼钢工业中的双包出钢、双槽出钢、三槽出钢、分步装料、混合炼钢和快速烧窑；机械工业中的多刀多刃、多夹“生活”，多工序、多机床管理，“蚂蚁啃骨头”；煤炭工业中多循环作业，水力采煤，掩护支架采煤，抽放瓦斯；电力工业中的不停电检修，远距离操作；纺织工业中的双排锭，离心锭，双层织布，静电植绒，静电纺纱；交通运输业中的铁路机车快速检洗，汽车列车化，船运航标电气化以及基本建设的快速施工等等，这些新的技术和先进经验，是在总路线的阳光照耀下的迎春怒放的朵朵鲜花，结出了一九五八年工业生产大跃进的丰硕的果实。
    一九五八年的经验证明，只有思想大跃进才能推动生产大跃进
    一九五八年重庆工业战线上的巨大胜利，充分证明了党的总路线的完全正确，充分证明了以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针、集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针和用“两条腿走路”的一整套方针的完全正确。它生动地说明了工人阶级和全体人民，一旦破除了迷信，解放了思想，就能发出巨大的智慧和无穷的力量，创造出许许多多过去很多人意想不到的奇迹。
    一九五八年重庆工业生产的巨大胜利，是在党的领导下，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命的结果。运动大致分为三个阶段。每次运动的发展总是从政治运动思想大跃进开始，从政治热潮掀起生产高潮，由思想大跃进推动生产大跃进，整个群众运动始终充满了革命精神和先进思想，不断推向新的高峰。第一阶段，乘着整风运动的胜利，横扫“三风”“五气”，大破陈旧的规章制度，实行干部参加劳动，工人参加管理，从根本上改进了社会主义企业内部的生产关系，干群关系，空前融洽，工人群众主人翁的责任感大大提高，共产主义思想大大发扬，一套有利于生产发展的社会主义企业管理制度逐步建立起来。第二阶段，由改革规章制度进入到技术革新，大改工艺规程和操作方法，在政治思想上，大张旗鼓地进行总路线的教育，提倡破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格。工人群众的政治热情，空前高涨，技术革命的浪潮，汹涌澎湃，大家争作多面手，实行多机床管理，创造发明，层出不穷，先进人物，不断涌现。生产力迅速发展。有的工种生产效率几倍，几十倍，乃至几百倍几千倍的提高。第三阶段，声势浩大的全民炼钢运动，带动了机械生产的更大跃进。在全民炼钢运动中，全市一百多万人民，男男女女，老老少少，一齐投入了战斗，“要把钢水变海水，要把山城变钢城”成为全民的战斗口号，全民性的政治运动和生产运动，激发机械工人的政治热情更加高涨，同时也向机械工业提出了更大的要求，在任务紧迫和原材料不足的情况下，促使技术革命深入发展到革机器的命，由于改革机器的部分配件到改造整个机器的设计、结构和制造，使之更科学、更适用，一个季度制造了几百种数以千计的简易机器，迅速加强了机器设备，提高了机器生产的能力。这三阶段步步深入，而又互相结合，工人群众奋战的智慧大放光彩，全年提出了八百三十六万多件革新建议，在党的领导下，“两参一改三结合”的“工业宪法”逐步贯彻，并成为在取得工矿企业中大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命的基础。
    重庆市一九五八年工业生产大跃进的过程中，绝不是没有斗争的。事实上，一九五八年大跃进的过程，就是树立力争高速度的革命思想，反对保守思想的过程，也是“多快好省”和“少慢差费”两条路线、两种思想的斗争过程。在斗争中我们驳斥了“怀疑派”，批判了保守思想，取得了胜利。那些对我们能不能大跃进持怀疑和观望态度的人们，已经在事实面前输光了。但斗争并没有结束，在我们提出实现一九五九年更大跃进的时候，那种认为生产潜力已挖尽的“生产到顶论”者又露头了，他们的这种论调，也是站不住脚的。
    1958年大跃进，为今年继续大跃进打下了雄厚基础
    一九五八年重庆工业生产的大跃进，不仅表现在工业产品的成倍增长，而且给了我们十分有利的条件，为今年继续大跃进打下了雄厚的基础，使今年的更大跃进有了更高更广的起脚点。一九五八年的大跃进，大大改变了工矿企业的生产面貌，提高了企业的生产水平；锻炼和壮大了工人阶级的队伍，工人阶级共产主义觉悟和共产主义风格大大发扬，掌握了很多新的技术，涌现了十万以上的先进生产者；而且进一步的改变了城市的面貌，将过去的消费城市逐步改变为生产城市了，数十万街道居民和职工家属参加了生产，已经做到了“人人有工作，户户无闲人”；特别重要的是通过一九五八年这个伟大的实践，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，我们不仅找到了一条多快好省地建设社会主义的康庄大道，而且在这样的康庄大道上取得了丰富的经验，有了这一切，不仅使我们在一九五九年能够继续大跃进，而且有可能跃进得更好。
    事实也正是如此，一九五九年刚刚开始不久，重庆市的工业生产和全国各地一样，很快掀起了一个新的生产高潮。重庆市的工人阶级在一九五八年胜利的基础上，乘胜挺进，快马加鞭，排除前进道路上的重重困难，夺取了第一季度的胜利。第一季度与去年同期比较，钢铁煤都是成倍地增长。这个事实对于那些对今年的更大跃进持怀疑态度的人们，正是一个有力的驳斥。
    在生产进一步更大跃进途程中，重庆市的工业生产遇到了原材料、电力、煤焦和交通运输等方面不足的困难。但这些物质上的困难，这些前进当中的困难，对于工人阶级来说，一向都是“不在话下”的，在困难面前他们发挥了冲天的干劲和顽强的战斗精神，大闹技术革命，不断地克服困难，继续跃进。不仅如此，困难锻炼了工人阶级，使他们学到了很多克服困难的本领，取得了丰富的精神财富。重庆钢铁工人在实现今年钢铁更大的跃进中，遇到了生铁含硫高的困难，他们集中力量展开了一场攻矿大战，创造了一套从料场管理到化铁炉、炼钢炉重重围歼硫磺的有效方法，终于把含硫高达百分之零点四的土铁，炼成了合格的洋钢。
    一九五八年大跃进的经验证明：厂矿企业生产大跃进的根本方法是大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，在实现更大跃进的一九五九年，这个经验不仅需要继续运用，而且需要不断发展。今年以来，重庆市工业战线上的群众运动，正在沿着这个方向，继续推进。今年二月，重庆钢铁公司创造了在企业内部纵横“一条龙”组织生产的经验，在此基础上，中共重庆市委组织与钢铁生产密切相关的煤焦、机械、电力、基本建设、交通运输等部门，开展了一个以钢为纲的联合大竞赛，形成了企业内外“一条龙”的规模浩大的群众运动，使企业内外结成了一个整体，互相推动，互相促进，造成了一个新的更大的生产高潮。
    第二季度开始，一个以高产优质为目标，以技术革命为中心的群众运动，正在重庆各个厂矿企业中迅速开展。与此同时，一个以提高企业管理水平为中心的群众性大鸣大放运动也正在猛烈开展，可以预料在此基础上，已经形成的生产高潮行将推向更大的高峰。
    自从党中央和国务院发出了召开全国先进集体和先进生产者代表大会的通知后，“创造新成绩，争取上北京”已经成为重庆市广大职工的行动口号。重庆工人阶级决不辜负党和政府的期望，他们正在努力创造优异生产成就来向国庆十周年献礼，并争取到祖国的首都来见我们亲爱的领袖毛主席。
    以上发言，请各位代表批评、指正。
