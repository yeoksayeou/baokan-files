Standing Firm on the People's Position, Forever Loyal to the Party and the Motherland

Chairman, Esteemed Committee Members:

I wholeheartedly endorse the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, as well as the reports on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee, the 1959 National Economic Plan, the 1958 National Final Accounts, and the 1959 National Budget made by other responsible comrades. Through these reports, I have further realized that under the brilliant illumination of the General Line for socialist construction, and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, our country's socialist construction is developing rapidly on a larger scale and at a higher speed. The most ideal communist society for mankind is already shining brightly in our country. The great unity of all ethnic groups in our country is more consolidated, our country's international status is rising day by day, and the strength of the socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is incomparably strengthened. All of this makes the people of all ethnic groups in our country and our friends feel proud and honored. However, our enemies at home and abroad are trembling with fear because of this, restless day and night, watching for opportunities, and doing everything possible to sabotage our country's socialist construction and national unity. Recently, the original Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, and under their guidance, openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and launched an armed rebellion. This serious crime of betraying the motherland, undermining unity, and destroying national solidarity is absolutely intolerable to the people of all ethnic groups in the country. I fully support the State Council's order to quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion. This is entirely in line with safeguarding the unity of the motherland and the interests of national unity. The occurrence of the Tibetan rebellion may seem like a bad thing, but because the State Council took timely and correct measures, the People's Liberation Army quickly quelled the rebellion, the rebel group will be completely eliminated, we will accelerate socialist construction in the Tibetan region, the Tibetan people will be reborn, and the Tibetan region will smoothly embark on the road to prosperity and happiness. The reason why the Tibetan incident occurred was, of course, due to the instigation of imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang, but on the other hand, the reactionary group among the upper strata of the Tibetan local government did not accept reform after the peaceful liberation, their feudal and stubborn reactionary thoughts were deeply rooted, and the reactionary class nature of the great serf owners did not change. Therefore, they adopted an attitude of outwardly compliant but inwardly opposed, half-hearted, and disloyal to the leadership and policies of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, eventually developing into open armed rebellion and betraying the motherland. We must firmly remember this lesson, stand firm on the people's position, and always be loyal to the Party and the motherland.

The Communist Party Brought Prosperity and Happiness to the Pastoral Areas

In 1958, our country's socialist construction achieved unprecedented and great victories. Like all parts of the country, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, has also made great achievements in various construction undertakings. Industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production, as well as scientific and cultural construction, have all experienced a great leap forward, and the people's communes have been realized in rural and pastoral areas.

Recently, I inspected the livestock production and people's communes in the pastoral areas of the Yikezhao League and the Xilingol League of the Autonomous Region. Although the time was short, the impression it left on me was extremely profound. First of all, the pastoral areas have achieved both population and livestock prosperity, presenting a thriving new scene. The Baiyanhanggai production team of the Bayanzhuuhe Commune, which I inspected, suffered from the exploitation and oppression of princes and herdsmen before liberation, as well as the harassment of Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The herdsmen lived a life of poverty and suffering year after year. At that time, the entire team of ninety-four herdsmen households had only more than 3,000 head of livestock. Some herdsmen households had only one head of livestock, and some herdsmen grazed for herdsmen or worked as slaves for temple granaries. They could not eat their fill or keep warm, venereal diseases were rampant, and the population declined sharply, with few children to be seen. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the efforts of local Party and government officials and people of all ethnic groups, the population has greatly increased and livestock has greatly developed in recent years, completely presenting a scene of population and livestock prosperity and thriving. The livestock of the production team has developed from 3,000 head at the time of liberation to 12,354 head, an increase of more than three times. The member Zhanbulazabu had only one head of livestock in 1946, but now he has developed to more than 300 head. The herdsman woman Daoligeer was a slave to the temple granary before liberation, but now she has more than 300 head of livestock. Thanks to the care of the Party and the government for ethnic minorities, vigorous efforts have been made to eradicate venereal diseases. The pastoral people have eradicated syphilis, and women who had not been able to have children for many years have had children after the venereal diseases were eradicated. The team has had eighty-four children in the past seven years, an increase of 21% in population. A mother hero, Baatar, from the team gave birth to eight children, all of whom are very healthy, and received care from the Party and material rewards from the government. I also took a photo with this mother hero with Vice Minister Hou Debang as a memento. In the two communes we visited, the children were in groups, forming clumps, and they surrounded us when we left, which was encouraging. New houses have been built in the communes and residential areas, and primary schools and clubs have been built. Some communes have also installed electric lights and wired broadcasting. I have been in Inner Mongolia for more than twenty years, and I have never seen such an encouraging new atmosphere in the pastoral areas before liberation. This makes me deeply feel that only today, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, can a new pastoral area with population and livestock prosperity, thriving, prosperous and happy emerge.

Secondly, before and after the people's communes in the pastoral areas, the policy of focusing on animal husbandry, combining agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry, running industries on a large scale, and diversified operations was implemented, and the eight measures for animal husbandry production were implemented, so that animal husbandry has been developed at a high speed, and income has been increased and the living standards improved. For example, the Baiyin Hangai production team carries out the division of labor and specialization, rationally arranges labor, and improves feeding management. They have established animal husbandry production teams, grass cutting teams, agricultural groups, sideline groups, breeding stations, and lambing and epidemic prevention groups, adjusted the herds, implemented the four-fixation methods of fixing people, fixing herds, fixing water and grass, and fixing sheds, moved pastures for grazing, carried out night grazing, extended grazing time, so that cattle and horses reached full fat, and sheep fat also increased compared with the past. In the past, the herdsmen only grazed and did not produce grain or vegetables at all. In the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they planted 752 mu of land, harvested 42,482 jin of grain and 2,798 jin of vegetables, creating good conditions for developing feed bases in pastoral areas and achieving grain self-sufficiency. They enthusiastically responded to the Party's call for running industries on a large scale, organized mining groups, carpentry groups, sewing groups, and dairy processing groups, and also established pig and chicken farms. In sideline production, they sold one million jin of sheep manure, increasing income and improving life, and hunted 290 yellow sheep, reducing consumption of domestic sheep.

Third, the economy of the herdsmen was transformed, livestock production was developed, and their living standards were improved. In the pastoral areas, the transformation of the economy of the herdsmen was carried out in three forms: joining cooperatives, running joint public-private livestock farms, and joining state-owned livestock farms. Because of the Party's correct policy of transforming the economy of the herdsmen, it was supported by the herdsmen. The forms adopted were also acceptable to the herdsmen. After the herdsmen joined joint-stock farms or state-owned farms, they were arranged to work, held positions, and had the power to perform their duties, and their skills and expertise were also brought into play. Thanks to the victory of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, not only the livestock of poor herdsmen has been developed and their lives have been improved, but also the livestock of the herdsmen has also been developed, and their income has not only not been reduced, but has increased compared with the past.

People's Communes Showed Great Superiority

In terms of the development of animal husbandry in the whole region: in 1958, the number of livestock increased by 9.3% compared with 1957, completing 124.5% of the annual plan for net increase in livestock. The pregnancy rate of large livestock in the whole region reached more than 85%, and the pregnancy rate of sheep reached more than 95%. Due to the adoption of pregnant mare serum injection, some ewes can obtain twin and multiple births. 2.8 million head of improved sheep were bred, and the Chenbarhu Banner also created a record of one sheep breeding ten thousand lambs. 7 billion jin of grass were cut, and 2.2 million mu of feed base were sown, which increased the number of sheds and opened up large areas of water-deficient grassland. More than 10,000 wells were drilled, and 33 million head of livestock were prevented and treated for epidemics. These series of production and construction achievements have increased by several times, even several times and dozens of times, compared with 1957. Houses have been built in the settlement points of pastoral areas, and schools, clubs, medical stations, etc. have been established. In short, there has also been a great leap forward in basic construction, industrial production, etc. In terms of the people's commune movement in pastoral areas, by the end of 1958, the people's communes had been realized in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia on the basis of cooperativization. The original more than 2,000 pastoral production cooperatives have developed into 163 people's communes, and the number of herdsmen joining the communes has accounted for 97.9% of the total number of herdsmen, and the number of livestock joining the communes has also reached more than 90% of the total number of livestock. Although the establishment time of the people's communes in pastoral areas is not long, it has already shown great superiority.

First, after the establishment of people's communes in pastoral areas, the new atmosphere of high-speed development of animal husbandry production was presented. The people's communes strengthened feeding management and vigorously prevented and controlled various livestock epidemics, so that the number of livestock that died of diseases throughout the year decreased by 70% compared with 1957, and the survival rate of winter lambs averaged more than 93%.

Second, the people's communes unified the use of manpower, materials and funds to carry out the unified planning and utilization of grassland pastures, and carried out large-scale basic construction in pastoral areas.

Third, the establishment of people's communes has also promoted the comprehensive development of industrial, agricultural, forestry and sideline production in pastoral areas. At present, most of the communes' settlement points have small processing factories such as iron and wood, brick and tile, leather, fur, wool spinning, sewing, and food, and pig and chicken farms have been established. Some communes have begun to plant trees and afforest the grasslands.

Fourth, the establishment of people's communes has created favorable conditions for accelerating settlement. The decentralization of state-owned farms, supply and marketing, credit, and cooperative enterprises has increased the state-owned components of the people's communes, and at the same time, these enterprises can be used as the center to start establishing economic center points.

Fifth, after the establishment of people's communes, national unity has been further consolidated and developed. There are many Han Chinese handicraft workers in pastoral areas, and some Han Chinese farmers also do temporary grazing and help establish feed bases in pastoral areas. After the establishment of people's communes, they joined the communes with local herdsmen, which is conducive to national unity and jointly building new socialist pastoral areas.

The realization of the people's communes in pastoral areas has opened up broad avenues for high-speed development of animal husbandry and various productions such as industry, agriculture, forestry, and sideline occupations, and has laid a solid foundation for further large-scale pastoral construction and the realization of technological and cultural revolutions in pastoral areas. I deeply feel that only under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao can the people of all ethnic groups in the vast pastoral areas get rid of poverty and backwardness and move towards a prosperous and happy socialist and communist society.

    内蒙古牧区欣欣向荣
    孙兰峰委员的发言
    站稳人民立场永远忠于党和祖国主席、各位委员：
    我衷心地拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，及其他各位负责同志所作的政协会务工作报告、一九五九年度国民经济计划报告和一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算的报告。通过这些报告，使我进一步认识到，我国的社会主义建设事业在总路线的光辉照耀下，在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，正以更大的规模和更高的速度，向前飞跃发展，人类最理想的共产主义社会，在我国已经灿烂在望。我国各族人民的大团结更加巩固，我国的国际地位日益提高，以苏联为首的社会主义和平民主阵营的力量无比壮大。所有这一切都使我国各族人民和我们的朋友感到骄傲和自豪。但是我们的国内外敌人确为此而胆战心惊，日夜不安，窥伺时机，千方百计，对我国的社会主义建设和民族团结进行破坏。最近原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，在勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，并在他们的指引下，公然撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，劫持达赖喇嘛，发动武装叛乱。这种背叛祖国、破坏统一、破坏民族团结的严重罪行，是全国各族人民所绝对不能容忍的。我完全拥护国务院发布的平息西藏叛乱、解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的命令，这是完全符合维护祖国统一和民族团结利益的。西藏叛乱事件的发生看起来是一件坏事，但是，经国务院及时地采取了正确措施，人民解放军迅速地平息了叛乱，叛乱集团将被彻底消灭，我们将加速西藏地区社会主义建设，西藏人民将获得新生，西藏地区也将顺利地走上繁荣幸福的道路。西藏事件之所以发生，固然是由于帝国主义和蒋匪帮的指引，但另一方面，西藏地方上层人士中的反动集团在和平解放后，不接受改造，封建的顽固的反动思想根深蒂固，大农奴主的反动阶级本质没有改变，因此，对党中央和国务院的领导和各项政策采取了阳奉阴违、三心二意、离心离德的态度，以致最后发展到公开武装叛乱，背叛祖国的危险地步。我们必须牢牢记取这一教训，站稳人民立场，永远忠于党忠于祖国。
    共产党给牧区带来了繁荣幸福
    一九五八年，我国各项社会主义建设事业获得了空前伟大的胜利。内蒙古自治区同全国各地一样，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，各项建设事业也取得了巨大成就，工农牧业生产，科学文化建设全面大跃进，农村牧区实现了人民公社化。
    最近我视察了自治区的伊克昭盟和锡林郭勒盟畜牧业生产和牧区人民公社，时间虽短，但留给我的印象是极其深刻的。首先，牧区实现了人畜两旺，呈现着欣欣向荣的新景象。我视察的巴彦朱日和公社白彦杭盖生产队，解放前由于遭受王公、牧主的剥削压迫和日本帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的扰害，牧民们成年累月的过着贫困痛苦的生活。全队九十四户牧民户在那个时候牲畜仅有三千多头，有的牧户仅有一头牲畜，有的牧民给牧主放牧或给庙仓做奴隶，终日食不得饱，衣不得暖，性病蔓延和流行，人口直线下降，很少看到小孩。解放后，在党和毛主席的正确领导及当地党政和各族人民的努力下，几年来，人口大增加，牲畜大发展，完全呈现了人畜两旺、欣欣向荣的景象。该生产队的牲畜由解放当时三千头，发展到一万二千三百五十四头，增加三倍以上，社员占布拉扎布，一九四六年仅有一头牲畜，现在已发展到三百多头，牧民妇女道力格尔，解放前给庙仓当奴隶，现在已有三百多头牲畜。由于党和政府对少数民族的关怀，大力开展了驱梅工作，牧区人民驱除了梅毒，过去多年不生小孩的妇女，驱梅后生了小孩。该队七年来生了八十四个小孩，人口增加百分之二十一，该队的一位母亲英雄巴特尔，她生了八个小孩，个个都很健壮，受到党的关怀和政府的物质奖励。我还与侯德榜副部长同这位母亲英雄照像留念。我们所到过的两个公社，孩子都是成群结队，一群一伙的，在我们离去时，孩子们前护后拥，令人振奋。公社和居民点盖起了新房子，修建了小学校、俱乐部，有的公社还装上了电灯和有线广播。我在内蒙古已有二十多年了，解放前从没有见到过牧区这样令人振奋的新气象。这使我深深感到，只有今天，在党和毛主席的正确领导下，才会出现人畜两旺、欣欣向荣、繁荣幸福的新牧区。
    其次，牧区人民公社化前后，执行了以牧为主，农牧林结合，大办工业，多种经营的方针，贯彻了牧业生产八项措施，畜牧业得到高速度发展，增加了收入，提高了生活水平。如白音杭盖生产队，进行分工分业，合理安排劳动力，改善饲养管理。他们建立了牧业生产队、打草队、农业组、副业组、配种站、接羔防疫组，调整了畜群，实行定人、定群、定水草、定棚圈的四定办法，移场放牧，进行夜牧，延长放牧时间，牛、马达到满膘，羊膘也较过去增加。过去牧民们只是放牧，根本不生产粮食、蔬菜，在一九五八年大跃进当中，他们种了七百五十二亩地，收获粮食四万二千四百八十二斤，蔬菜二千七百九十八斤，为牧区发展饲料基地，做到粮食自给创造了良好条件。他们热烈响应党大办工业的号召，组织了采矿组、木工组、缝纫组、乳品加工组，还建立了养猪、养鸡场。在副业生产上出卖羊粪一百万斤，增加了收入，改善了生活，打黄羊二百九十只，减少了对家羊的消费。
    第三、改造了牧主经济，发展了畜牧业生产，并提高了他们的生活水平。在牧区对牧主经济的改造是采取加入合作社、办公私合营牧场和加入国营牧场等三种形式。由于党对牧主经济改造政策的正确，受到牧主的拥护。所采取的形式也为牧主乐于接受。牧主加入合营牧场或国营牧场后，安排了工作，担任了职务，有职有权，他们的技术和专长也得到发挥。由于畜牧业社会主义改造的胜利，不但贫苦牧民的牲畜得到发展，生活得到改善，而牧主的牲畜也有所发展，收入不但没有降低，反而较前有所增加。
    人民公社显示了巨大优越性
    就全区畜牧业发展的情况来说：一九五八年牲畜头数比一九五七年纯增百分之九点三，完成全年牲畜纯增计划的百分之一百二十四点五。全区大畜怀胎率达百分之八十五以上，绵羊怀胎率达百分之九十五以上。由于采取妊娠马血清注射，部分母羊可获双胎及多胎。配种改良绵羊二百八十万只，陈巴尔虎旗还创造了一羊配万羔的丰产纪录。打草七十亿斤，播种饲料基地二百二十万亩，增加了棚圈，开辟了大片缺水草场。打井一万多眼，对三千三百万头牲畜进行了疫病防治。这一系列的生产建设成就，比一九五七年都是成倍的甚至几倍和十几倍的增长。牧区的定居点上盖起了房子，建立了学校、俱乐部、医疗站等，总之在基本建设、工业生产等方面也有很大跃进。在牧区人民公社化运动方面，到一九五八年底，内蒙古牧区在合作化的基础上已经实现了人民公社化。由原来的两千多个牧业生产合作社，发展成为一百六十三个人民公社，入社牧户已占总牧户的百分之九十七点九，入社牲畜也达到牲畜总头数的百分之九十以上。牧区人民公社建立的时间虽然不久，但它已经显示了巨大的优越性。
    第一、牧区人民公社成立以后，使畜牧业生产呈现了高速度发展的新气象。各人民公社加强了饲养管理，大力防治各种牲畜疫病，全年因病死亡的牲畜比一九五七年减少百分之七十，冬羔成活率平均达到百分之九十三以上。
    第二、人民公社统一运用了人力、物力和资金，进行草原牧场的统一规划和利用，进行牧区大规模的基本建设。
    第三、人民公社的建立，也促进了牧区工、农、林业和副业生产全面大发展。现在绝大部分公社的定居点上都有铁木、砖瓦、皮草、毛纺、缝纫、食品等小型加工厂，建立了养猪、养鸡场，有的公社已开始在草原上植树造林。
    第四、人民公社的建立为加速定居创造了有利条件。国营牧场、供销、信用、合作等企业部门的下放，增加了人民公社全民所有制的成分，同时又可以这些企业为中心，开始建立起经济中心点。
    第五、人民公社建立后，民族团结更进一步巩固和发展了。牧区有不少汉族手工业工人，也有些汉族农民在牧区做临时放牧和帮助建立饲料基地。人民公社建立后，他们和当地牧民一起参加了公社，有利于民族团结和共同建设社会主义的新牧区。
    牧区实现了人民公社化，就为高速度发展畜牧业及工、农、林、副业等各项生产开辟了广阔的道路，为进一步大规模的牧区建设，实现牧区的技术革命与文化革命打下了稳固的基础。我深切地感到，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，广大牧区的各族人民才能摆脱贫困和落后，走向繁荣幸福的社会主义和共产主义社会。
