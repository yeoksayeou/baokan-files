Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Omar U Sidiq, head of the Algerian military delegation, delivered a speech at the capital's people from all walks of life rally supporting the Algerian people's struggle for national independence. The full text is as follows:

Mr. Chairman Guo Moruo, Marshal Chen Yi, dear comrades and friends:

I am honored to extend to you the fraternal respect of the Algerian revolution. Today, with excitement, I represent the Algerian people to speak to our Chinese brothers and to the various organizations that organized the Support Algeria Week.

The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, at its meeting in New Delhi, pointed out the seriousness of the Algerian war and stated that only negotiations that take into account the Algerian people's desire for independence can restore the necessary peace.

The Algerian war is expanding and becoming more serious. This war could spread to the entire North Africa every day, which is a terrible danger. The Algerian war has become a factor in the Cold War. It deepens international tensions. Therefore, the French government and the Algerian government must immediately negotiate to end the Algerian war. The inhumane massacres carried out by France in Algeria must be stopped.

On March 31, 1958, a representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front reported to you from this same platform the barbaric and cruel acts of France in Algeria. He told you about the collective massacres, bombings, economic blockades, the division of Algeria to create death zones, and the situation of Algerian refugees carried out by France in Algeria. This representative also described to you the cruel war waged by the Algerian people alone against 800,000 French troops and police equipped by NATO and funded by imperialism. This representative told you the numbers of Algerian deaths and disappearances. He clearly expressed to you the Algerian people's firm determination to liberate themselves. He also affirmed to you that Algeria's guarantee—the Algerian National Liberation Army will fight to the end until independence is achieved. The suffering endured by the Algerian people will only strengthen their confidence in the struggle and their will for liberation.

Since that time, events that have occurred in the military, diplomatic, and political fields have proven the urgency of stopping the Algerian war. French colonialists have intensified their repression of the Algerian people. The occupying forces have established hundreds of concentration camps. The enemy calls these concentration camps "regroupment centers." The enemy drove Algerians from their original homes and cultivated lands to these places. The enemy surrounded these concentration camps with barbed wire. These Algerians live in terrible conditions. The French newspaper "Le Monde" reported on March 12, 1959, that as many as one million Algerians have been imprisoned in such concentration camps.

In Algeria, the French army brutally wages war against the Algerian masses in an attempt to isolate the Algerian National Liberation Army and destroy the people's national aspirations. The enemy's behavior towards the Algerian people is a true act of extermination. Many Algerian children aged one to four have been stabbed to death with sharp needles. Psychological warfare experts in the French army in Algeria use concentration camps as large laboratories. They destroy the nervous systems of Algerians, starve them, and torture them until they are emaciated before releasing them. This is how the Algerian people live in anxiety, terror, and pain. The tasks of the Algerian fighters are even more arduous. They must fight against the invaders and protect the people at the same time. The supply and organization of hundreds of thousands of people wandering in remote areas has become a serious concern for the Algerian National Liberation Army. These people must be provided with clothing, housing, and food. In addition, weapons, ammunition, administration, and funds are needed.

From a political point of view, the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on September 19, 1958, affirmed the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue. On September 26, 1958, Mr. Ferhat Abbas, Prime Minister of the Algerian Provisional Government, declared in a government statement in Cairo that the Algerian government was prepared to negotiate with France on the peaceful resolution of the issue. To this initiative, General de Gaulle responded with a proposal for a "peace of the brave," in other words, unconditional surrender.

On January 27, 1959, Mr. Mohammed, the Algerian Minister of Information, stated in his reply to French Prime Minister Michel Debré: "French officials have still not understood that Algeria's independence, like that of other regions in Africa, is an inevitable trend. Algeria's independence is inevitable. If the door to the hope of peace in Algeria is still closed, France alone should be responsible for this."

The war in Algeria is suffocating the French economy. The French government has appealed to foreign capital to indirectly share the costs of the war. This sharing is done through foreign investment in Algeria to develop the country's natural resources, especially the oil in the Sahara. We want to emphasize that the contracts recently signed by the French government and many foreign oil companies are unreliable.

The reason why peace has not yet come to Algeria should be entirely blamed on France. The Algerian government is prepared to negotiate in Algeria, and it is also prepared to fight on, even if this war lasts for another ten years. After its establishment, the Algerian government immediately distributed many modern weapons to the National Liberation Army, thereby strengthening its military strength, and soon launched a campaign for recognition. The Algerian government was very excited to learn that the Government of the People's Republic of China immediately recognized it after its establishment. Six hundred and fifty million Chinese people openly stand on the side of Algeria. China's support for the independence movement is not just empty talk. People's China is one of the main initiators of the Bandung Principles. People's China recognizes that we are following the Bandung Principles. Many Asian and African countries have also recognized the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. We hope that all Asian and African governments, representing three-fifths of the world's population, will recognize the Algerian government, so that they will contribute to saving peace in Algeria. Diplomatic support is an effective way to fight colonialism.

Last year, the Chinese people enthusiastically held Algerian Support Day. March 30, 1958, was a day of great significance. All mass organizations in China expressed their support for the Algerian people in struggle. Several groups financially supported the Algerian people's struggle. The inhumane massacres carried out by France in Algeria were severely condemned. Six hundred and fifty million Chinese people declared their will to forever stand on the side of the Algerian people in struggle. With the support of this popular will, the Chinese government recognized our government. It once invited a delegation from the Algerian government to visit China. Today, the first Algerian military delegation sent abroad has also arrived in Beijing. Now, various Chinese people's organizations are holding a Support Algeria Week. This Support Algeria Week was decided by the Asian-African Solidarity Council held in Cairo on February 11, 1959. The Council made the following resolution on the Algerian issue: "Recommend that Asian and African governments that have not yet recognized the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria do so as soon as possible; support the Algerian people against those who plunder its Saharan resources; request the people of Asian and African countries to do their best in the future to prevent all assistance to the French government." Like the resolutions of other Asian-African conferences, the Council also requested the people of Asian and African countries to economically boycott France.

The Chinese people are faithful to the Bandung spirit. Today—April 5, 1959—she once again stands up to support the suffering Algerian people. The Chinese people are willing to help the 500,000 Algerian refugees wandering in Morocco and Tunisia.

The Chinese people, who have suffered from hunger, and have been colonized, support the Algerian people. The Chinese people have suffered from aggression. Today, she continues to fight against American interference. The Chinese people support us against the collusion of imperialists. She will support us in repelling the aggression of NATO. She will support us in treating those who have been wounded by American bullets. She will ensure that the Algerian revolution is not destroyed by American tanks, American shells, and American bombs. She supports our fight against the threat of US General Norstad.

The Chinese people and the Algerian people are closely linked together. The Chinese people will fight to ensure that Algeria does not become a base for aggression, and does not become a land for colonial plunder. China will mobilize all forces to stand by our side, so that Algeria's Sahara will not become a French atomic bomb test site. The Chinese people who are helping the Algerian people will do everything possible to strive for the victory of the Bandung spirit, and for the victory of Algeria and world peace.

The Algerian people are united and fight firmly until final victory is achieved.

Long live Asian-African solidarity!

Long live the Chinese people!

Long live Algeria!

    中国人民和我们站在一起
    阿尔及利亚人民一定争取最后胜利
    乌西迪克在首都各界人民支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争大会上的讲话
    新华社5日讯　阿尔及利亚军事代表团团长奥马尔·乌西迪克在首都各界人民支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争大会上的讲话，全文如下：郭沫若主席先生，陈毅元帅，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我很荣幸地向你们致以阿尔及利亚革命的兄弟般的敬意。今天，我怀着激动的心情，代表阿尔及利亚人民，向中国的兄弟们，向组织支持阿尔及利亚周的各个团体讲话。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会在新德里举行的会议，曾经指出阿尔及利亚战争的严重性，并声称，只有举行注意到阿尔及利亚人民独立愿望的谈判才有可能恢复必要的和平。
    阿尔及利亚战争日趋扩大和严重。这一战争每天都有可能蔓延到整个北非去，这是一种可怕的危险。阿尔及利亚战争已经变成冷战的一个因素。它加深着国际紧张局势。因而法国政府和阿尔及利亚政府必须立即进行谈判以结束阿尔及利亚战争。法国在阿尔及利亚进行的灭绝人性的屠杀必须制止。
    1958年3月31日，一位阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表，曾经在这同一讲坛上向你们报告过法国在阿尔及利亚的野蛮残酷行为。他向你们谈到法国在阿尔及利亚进行的集体屠杀、轰炸、经济封锁、分割阿尔及利亚造成死亡区，以及阿尔及利亚难民的情况。这位代表也向你们描述了阿尔及利亚人民单独地对由北大西洋公约组织装备并得到帝国主义资助的八十万法国军队和警察所进行的残酷战争。这位代表曾把阿尔及利亚人死亡和失踪的数字告诉了你们。他明确地向你们表示了阿尔及利亚人民解放自己的坚定决心。他还肯定地向你们表示过，阿尔及利亚的保证——阿尔及利亚民族解放军将斗争到底，直到获得独立为止。阿尔及利亚人民所遭受的痛苦，只会坚定他们斗争的信心和解放的意志。
    从那个时候起，在军事、外交以及政治方面所发生的事情，都证明了制止阿尔及利亚战争的迫切性。法国殖民主义者加强了对阿尔及利亚人民的镇压。占领军建立了数以百计的集中营。敌人把这些集中营称之为集结营。敌人把阿尔及利亚人从他们原来居住的房屋和耕作的土地上赶到那里。敌人用铁丝网把这些集中营包围起来。这些阿尔及利亚人生活在可怕的环境中。1959年3月12日法国“世界报”报道说，被禁锢在这样的集中营里的阿尔及利亚人已达一百万之多。
    在阿尔及利亚，法国军队残暴地对阿尔及利亚群众进行战争，以图孤立阿尔及利亚民族解放军和摧毁人民的民族愿望。敌人对阿尔及利亚人民群众的行为，是一种真正的灭绝人性的行为。许多一岁到四岁的阿尔及利亚儿童被用尖针刺死。在阿尔及利亚的法国军队中的心理战专家把集中营当成大的实验室。他们破坏阿尔及利亚人的神经系统，使这些人受饥挨饿，折磨得骨瘦如柴之后才放回去。阿尔及利亚人民就是这样生活在忧虑、恐怖和痛苦中。阿尔及利亚战士们的任务是更加艰巨了。他们必须一面进行反侵略者的斗争，一面保护人民。对几十万流浪在穷乡僻野的人们的供养和组织，成为阿尔及利亚民族解放军严重关切的问题。必须供给这些人穿、住、吃。此外，还需要武器、弹药，需要行政管理，需要经费。
    从政治观点来说，1958年9月19日阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，肯定了和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的可能性。1958年9月26日，阿尔及利亚临时政府总理费尔哈特·阿巴斯先生在开罗发表的政府声明中宣称：阿尔及利亚政府准备和法国谈判和平解决的问题。对这个倡议，戴高乐将军却报之以“勇士的和平”的建议，换句话说，就是无条件投降。
    1959年1月27日，阿尔及利亚宣传部长穆罕默德先生在他给法国总理米歇尔·德勃雷的答复中，曾经声明说：“法国官方还远远没有了解，阿尔及利亚获得独立，同非洲的其他地区一样，已是大势所趋。阿尔及利亚获得独立是不可避免的。如果说，在阿尔及利亚，和平希望的大门还关闭着，唯一应该对此负责的就是法国。”
    阿尔及利亚的战争窒息着法国的经济。法国政府曾向外国资本呼吁，要求间接地分担战争的费用。这种分担是通过外国在阿尔及利亚进行投资，开发这个国家的自然资源，特别是撒哈拉的石油的方式来进行的。我们要强调指出，最近法国政府和许多外国石油公司所签订的合同是靠不住的。
    阿尔及利亚的和平所以还没有到来，应该完全归咎于法国。阿尔及利亚政府准备在阿尔及利亚进行谈判，同样地它也准备打下去，即便这场战争还要延续十年。阿尔及利亚政府成立后，立刻把许多现代化武器发给民族解放军使用，从而加强了它的军事实力，不久，就发起了一个争取承认的战役。阿尔及利亚政府非常兴奋地获悉，紧接着它的成立，中华人民共和国政府就予以承认。六亿五千万中国人民公开地站在阿尔及利亚这一边。中国对独立运动的声援，不是一句空话。人民中国是万隆原则的主要倡议者之一。人民中国承认我们是遵循万隆原则。很多亚非国家也承认了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府。我们希望代表着地球五分之三人口的一切亚非国家政府承认阿尔及利亚政府，这样他们将对拯救阿尔及利亚和平作出贡献。外交上的声援是反殖民主义斗争的一个有效的方式。
    去年，中国人民振奋人心地举行了声援阿尔及利亚日。1958年3月30日是一个意义重大的日子。中国的一切群众组织都表示声援斗争中的阿尔及利亚人民。若干团体在经济上支持了阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。法国在阿尔及利亚进行的灭绝人性的屠杀，受到了严正的谴责。六亿五千万中国人民宣布了他们永远站在斗争中的阿尔及利亚人民一边的意志。在这种人民意志的支持下，中国政府承认了我国政府。它曾经邀请了阿尔及利亚政府代表团访问中国。今天，阿尔及利亚派往外国的第一个军事代表团也来到了北京。现在中国各人民团体又举办了支援阿尔及利亚周。这个支援阿尔及利亚周是1959年2月11日在开罗举行的亚非团结理事会所决定的。这个理事会曾经就阿尔及利亚问题作出了下列决议：“建议尚未承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的亚非各国政府，尽快予以承认；支持阿尔及利亚人民反对那些掠夺它撒哈拉资源的人；请求亚非各国人民今后尽力阻止一切对法国政府的援助。”正如同其它亚非会议的决议一样，理事会还请求亚非各国人民从经济上抵制法国。
    中国人民忠实于万隆精神。今天——1959年4月5日——她又一次地挺身而出，支援蒙受灾难的阿尔及利亚人民。中国人民愿意帮助五十万流浪在摩洛哥和突尼斯的阿尔及利亚难民。
    曾经受饥挨饿、受过殖民统治的中国人民支持阿尔及利亚人民。中国人民曾经遭受过侵略。今天她还继续为反对美国的干涉而斗争。中国人民支援我们对付帝国主义者的勾结。她将支援我们击退北大西洋公约组织的侵略。她将支援我们医治那些被美国子弹打伤的人。她将使阿尔及利亚革命不为美国坦克、美国炮弹和美国炸弹所摧毁。她支持我国对付美国诺斯塔德将军的威胁。
    中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民紧密地联结在一起。中国人民将进行斗争，使阿尔及利亚不成为侵略基地，不成为殖民掠夺的土地。中国将动员一切力量站在我们一边，使阿尔及利亚的撒哈拉不成为法国的原子弹试验场所。援助阿尔及利亚人民的中国人民，将尽一切努力争取万隆精神的胜利，争取阿尔及利亚和世界和平的胜利。
    阿尔及利亚人民团结在一起，坚定地斗争下去，直到获得最后胜利为止。
    亚非团结万岁！
    中国人民万岁！
    阿尔及利亚万岁！
