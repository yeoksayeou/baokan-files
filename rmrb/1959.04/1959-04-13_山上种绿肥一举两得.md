　　Planting Green Manure on Mountains Achieves Two Goals at Once
    Zhao Jiawu Production Team of Linpu Commune, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, is a semi-mountainous area. They have planted fruit trees, mulberry, and tea on the mountains. Due to the high mountains and steep slopes, fertilizer is scarce, and soil and water are difficult to conserve. In order to solve this contradiction, the production team selected 25 mu (with slopes of about 30 degrees) in the fruit tree mountains last September to trial planting alfalfa. It is now blooming and generally reaches three chi in length. Currently, the peach and other fruit trees in Zhao Jiawu are full of flowers and have begun to bear fruit, and tea is starting to be picked. It is the season when fertilizer is needed, so the commune members are turning and burying this alfalfa in the soil as fertilizer.
    Planting green manure on the mountains conserves soil and water and accumulates fertilizer, truly achieving two goals at once. Places with fruit tree mountains may also wish to try it.

### 山上种绿肥一举两得

　　山上种绿肥一举两得
    浙江省萧山县临浦公社赵家坞生产队是一个半山区，他们在山上种了果树和桑、茶。由于山高坡陡，肥料很缺，水土也难保持。为了解决这个矛盾，生产队于去年9月在果木山中选择二十五亩（坡度在三十度左右），试种了苜蓿，现已开花，一般都有三市尺长。目前，赵家坞满山遍野的桃树等果木已花谢孕果，茶叶开始采摘，正是需要肥料的季节，社员们就把这些苜蓿翻埋土中作为肥料。
    山上种绿肥，又保水土、又积肥，真是一举两得。有果木山的地方，也不妨试一试。
