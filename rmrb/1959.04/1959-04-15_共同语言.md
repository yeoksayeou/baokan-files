    One evening, I was invited to participate in a farewell party held in Xiamen by the Northeast Comfort Mission for the soldiers and civilians on the front lines. This mission, leading ten art troupes totaling over 300 people from various provinces and cities in the Northeast, had conducted extensive and in-depth comfort performances for the officers and soldiers of the three armed services and the people on the front lines for two months. According to comrades in the mission, they had visited the front lines close to the enemy, small islands, scattered duty outposts, and any place with even a small contingent of troops stationed there. Their requirement was: not to let a single soldier miss their performances. In addition to performing, they also helped the frontline soldiers with a lot of work, carrying water, chopping firewood, cooking, sewing clothes, wiping cannons, carrying shells, repairing fortifications, digging tunnels, standing guard for the soldiers, and sometimes even participating in combat, carrying submachine guns, shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, patrolling the coast in the front. All the comrades participating in the comfort work received a profound education through this period of intense activity, increased their love for the soldiers and civilians on the front lines, and expressed that after returning to the Northeast, they would convey and report to the 50 million people of the Northeast the heroic struggle of the frontline soldiers and civilians on the coastal defense front and various heroic model examples, to inspire them to make even greater achievements on the production front.
    The frontline soldiers and civilians expressed deep gratitude to the comfort mission from afar. Through their comfort activities, the frontline soldiers and civilians, especially the officers and soldiers, were deeply moved by the model examples of the people in the rear working hard in production and the meticulous care and love shown to them. They put forward letters of determination, vowing to repay the Party and the people's kindness with practical actions of patriotism, striving to kill the enemy, and striving to learn military science and technology well. At this meeting, several heroic soldiers who had made meritorious service on the front lines and labor models who both produced and fought expressed their determination and gratitude, completing the farewell ceremony in a warm and excited atmosphere.
    I have attended many, many such meetings. Not to mention the past. Since the more intense artillery battles began on the Xiamen front last August, the capital and many provinces and cities across the country have formed large-scale frontline comfort missions to carry out comfort activities on the front lines. The national literary and art circles and the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese... have also organized large comfort teams separately to carry out extensive and in-depth comfort activities. Each comfort mission's work begins with a welcoming conference and ends with a farewell conference. The forms and methods of comfort work are similar. But every time I attend a meeting of this nature, I always feel an indescribable sense of joy, excitement, and freshness, as if within such a generally consistent form, there are endless new people and new things waiting to be discovered, and endless new educational meanings waiting to be enlightened.
    Just as the Resist America, Aid Korea movement played a huge role in promoting the restoration and transformation of China's socio-economy after liberation, our battles in the Taiwan Strait have also had a great inspiring effect on socialist construction. The people in the front and the rear constantly report to each other on the achievements of construction and combat, constantly exchange successful experiences on the production and military fronts, and constantly encourage and inspire patriotic enthusiasm, making everyone feel that under the leadership and education of the Party, they are all enthusiastically, conscientiously, and tirelessly doing the same cause in different positions. In this way, the front and the rear are united as one, and the military and civilians are integrated. Large-scale consolation and comfort work plays a very meaningful bridging role in this. In our country, every mass work becomes the most effective work of unity and education. Regardless of whether it is in the north or south of the country, or at the ends of the earth, we all have a common language. How far we have left the past Chinese society! How deep and widespread the Party's educational and ideological work is!

    一天晚上，我应邀参加了东北慰问团在厦门市举行的告别前线军民的晚会。这个慰问团率领着东北各省市的十个艺术剧团，共三百余人，在前线各地慰问演出两个月，对前线三军将士和前线人民进行了广泛深入的慰问活动。据慰问团同志说，在逼近敌人的前沿阵地，在小岛上，在分散值勤的小分队，在任何有零星部队留守的地方，他们都去过了，他们的要求是：不让一个战士没有看到他们的演出。除演出外，他们还帮助前线战士做了不少工作，为他们担水，劈柴，作饭，缝衣服，擦大炮，扛炮弹，修阵地，打坑道，替战士站岗，有时还参加战斗，背着冲锋枪，和战士肩并着肩，一起在前沿的海边巡逻。所有参加慰问工作的同志，通过这一段时间的紧张活动，受到了深刻的教育，增加了他们对前线军民的热爱，并表示他们回东北后，将把前线军民在海防前线的英勇奋斗情形和各种英雄模范事例，向东北五千万人民传达汇报，以激励他们在生产战线上做出更多更大的成绩。
    前线军民对来自远方的慰问团更是表示深厚的感激情绪。经过他们的慰问活动，前线军民，特别是部队官兵对祖国后方人民努力生产的模范事例和对于他们表示的无微不至的关怀和爱护，深受感动，纷纷提出决心书，要以爱国主义的实际行动，努力杀敌，努力学好军事科学技术，来报答党和人民的恩情。在这个会上，几位在前线立了功的英雄士兵和边生产边战斗的劳动模范都表示了决心与谢意，在热烈而激动的气氛中，完成了告别仪式。
    我参加这样形式的会，已经有许多许多次了。过去的不讲。自去年8月厦门前线展开较激烈的炮战以后，首都和全国许多省市地区，都组成了大规模的前线慰问团，到前线进行慰问，全国文艺界，全国侨联……也都分别组织庞大的慰问队伍，展开广泛深入的慰问活动。每个慰问团的工作，由欢迎大会开始，由告别大会结束，慰问工作的形式和做法，都差不多。但我每次参加这种性质的会，总感到有说不出的愉快、兴奋和新鲜的感觉，好像在那样大体一致的形式里，有无限待发现的新人新事物，有无限待启发的新的教育意义。
    正如同抗美援朝运动，曾经对我国刚解放后的社会经济恢复和改造起过了极大的推动作用一样，我们在台湾海峡的战斗，也对社会主义建设发生了莫大的激励作用，前方后方的人民，不断相互汇报建设和战斗的成绩，不断交流生产战线和军事战线的成功经验，不断相互鼓舞激励起爱国主义热情，使大家感到在党的领导和教育下，彼此都是在不同岗位上，热情地，认真地，不怕辛苦地做着同一的事业。这一来，前方后方联成为一体，军民打成了一片。大规模的慰劳慰问工作，就在其中起了极有意义的桥梁作用。在我们国家，每一件群众性的工作，都成为最有效的团结教育工作。无间于天南地北或海角天涯，我们都有了共同的语言。我们该离开了过去的中国社会多么远啊！党的教育思想工作，该是多么深入普遍啊！
