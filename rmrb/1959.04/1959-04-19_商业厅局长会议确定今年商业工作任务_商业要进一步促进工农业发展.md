Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch. The National Conference of Commercial Bureau Directors, which concluded today, determined that the central task of commercial work in 1959 is to strive to realize the national economic plan centered on the four major targets, further promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, and do our best to arrange the market well.

The conference believes that in order to complete the above tasks, the following measures should be taken to further promote the development of industrial and agricultural production:

	I. Focusing on solving the raw material problem, further strengthen cooperation between industry and commerce to promote industrial development. In addition to doing a good job in the distribution of materials allocated by the state to the market, we must first vigorously strengthen the procurement, processing, and transportation of agricultural and sideline products, local products, and "waste products"; secondly, we must assist industrial departments in rationally allocating and using raw materials, and closely cooperate with industrial departments to actively assist in organizing and promoting those effective methods of saving and substituting raw materials; we must also clear warehouses and tap all usable raw material potential to make them play their due role.

	II. Continue to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" and do a good job in the supply of means of production. In terms of agricultural means of production, in addition to the portion supplied by the state, we must also actively cooperate with industrial and agricultural departments, rely on the people's communes, vigorously develop indigenous fertilizers and indigenous pesticides, and make extensive use of indigenous iron and steel to manufacture simple water-lifting tools and farm tools, striving for accessories and some small hardware to solve the needs in production.

	III. Continue to implement the policy of "collect more, collect quickly, collect well, and collect sufficiently" and strengthen the procurement of major agricultural products. The "four on-the-spot" methods adopted last year (i.e., on-the-spot inspection and grading at the commune, on-the-spot weighing at the commune, on-the-spot settlement at the commune, and on-the-spot direct transportation to processing plants) have achieved great results, and these experiences should be affirmed. This year, we must continue to adopt the methods of relying on the people's communes, vigorously launching mass movements, and combining shock procurement with regular procurement to achieve the goals of collecting more, collecting quickly, collecting well, and collecting sufficiently. In order to adapt to the huge task of agricultural and sideline product procurement this year, we must also cooperate closely with transportation departments, rely on and help the communes to solve short-distance transportation problems.

	IV. Promote the contract system to promote the development of the diverse economy of the communes. The major agricultural and sideline product production and sales agreements signed by the agricultural and commercial departments of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in January of this year should be specifically implemented in the form of contracts to the communes and production teams to ensure the complete realization of the general agreement.

The conference believes that in arranging market work, the following measures must be grasped: 1. Organize the circulation of goods well. 2. Do a good job in the rational distribution of goods. 3. Resolutely guarantee the completion of the state's established export plan. 4. Continue to carry out the technical revolution and cultural revolution to improve labor efficiency and cultivate and train commercial cadres who are both red and expert.

In addition, the conference also proposed that commercial departments must continue to improve business management and strive to reduce commodity circulation costs by another 10% this year. At the same time, on the basis of keeping the existing system unchanged, commercial organizations should be appropriately strengthened, and commodity management, planning, statistics, finance, and accounting systems should be conscientiously implemented.

The conference resolved that in order to complete the tasks of commercial work this year, it is necessary to continue to vigorously launch mass movements and widely and deeply carry out the "Six Good" Red Banner movement passed by this conference among all employees. The conference called on all employees in the commercial system to work hard to complete this year's tasks and come up with more outstanding achievements to welcome the fourth quarter's meeting of advanced collectives and advanced producer representatives.

During the conference, Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the meeting and gave important instructions.

　　商业厅局长会议确定今年商业工作任务
　　商业要进一步促进工农业发展
    新华社17日讯　今天闭幕的全国商业厅局长会议确定：为实现以四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而努力，进一步促进工农业生产的发展，尽力把市场安排好。这是1959年商业工作的中心任务。
    会议认为：为了完成上述任务，在进一步促进工农业生产发展的工作中，应当采取以下措施：
    一、以解决原料问题为中心，进一步加强工商协作，以促进工业的发展。除了做好国家调拨给市场的物资分配工作外，首先要用大力加强农副产品和土产“废品”的收购、加工、调运工作；其次要协助工业部门合理调配使用原料，并与工业部门密切协作，对那些行之有效的节约代用原料的办法，积极协助组织推广；还要清理仓库，把一切可用的原料潜力挖掘出来，使它们发挥应有的作用。
    二、继续贯彻两条腿走路的方针，作好生产资料的供应工作。在农业生产资料方面，除了国家供应的部分外，还要积极协同工农业部门，依靠人民公社，大搞土化肥、土农药、并大量地利用土钢土铁制造简易提水工具、农具，力争配件和部分小五金，以解决生产中的需要。
    三、继续贯彻“多收、快收、收好、收足”的方针，加强主要农产品的收购工作。去年采用“四就”方法（即就社验级，就社过磅，就社结算，就社直运加工厂）已取得很大成绩，这些经验应当肯定下来。今年还要继续采取依靠人民公社、大搞群众运动、突击收购与经常收购相结合的方法，以达到多收、快收、收好、收足的目的。为了适应今年农副产品收购的巨大任务，还要与交通运输部门密切协作，依靠和帮助公社，解决短途运输问题。
    四、推广合同制度，促进公社多种经济的发展。使各省、市、自治区农业和商业部门在今年1月份签订的主要农副产品产销协议书，用合同形式具体落实到公社和生产队，以保证总协议的完满实现。
    会议认为在安排市场的工作中，要抓紧以下措施：一、把商品的流通工作组织好。二、作好商品的合理分配。三、坚决保证完成国家已定的出口计划。四、继续开展技术革命和文化革命运动，以提高劳动效率和培养训练又红又专的商业干部。
    此外，会议还提出商业部门必须继续改进经营管理，争取在今年内把商品流转费用再降低10％。同时要在现行体制不变的基础上，适当地加强商业机构，并认真执行商品管理和计划、统计、财务、会计等制度。
    会议决议：要完成今年商业工作的任务，必须继续大搞群众运动，把这次会议通过的“六好”红旗运动，在全体职工中广泛、深入地开展起来。会议号召商业系统全体职工，努力完成今年的任务，拿出更出色的成绩来迎接第四季的先进集体和先进生产者代表会议。
    会议期间，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念，曾到会作重要指示。
