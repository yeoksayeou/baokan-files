Committee members,

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of the leading comrades.

Since 1954, when the Party called on us in the agricultural sector to organize the agricultural heritage of the motherland, agricultural colleges and research institutions have begun to pay attention to this issue. In April 1955, the Ministry of Agriculture convened experts and scholars from various fields in Beijing to discuss specific methods for organizing the agricultural heritage of the motherland. Since then, a small number of senior teachers or young teachers with a good command of ancient Chinese books from the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Agricultural University, Nanjing Agricultural College, South China Agricultural College, Northwest Agricultural College, etc., formed small groups. Under the leadership and encouragement of the Party, they have been engaged in this arduous and glorious work and have achieved considerable results in recent years.

The Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has proofread and annotated the "Di Yuan" chapter of "Guanzi" from the 3rd and 4th centuries BC and the four articles including "Shang Nong" preserved in "Lüshi Chunqiu." Beijing Agricultural University has published "Bibliography of Chinese Agricultural Books," "Ten Kinds of Area Planting," and "Qin Jin Agricultural Sayings." The Chinese Agricultural Heritage Research Office of Nanjing Agricultural College has published "Research on Supplement to the Book of Agriculture," compiled selected works of Chinese agricultural heritage on rice, wheat, and cotton, and annotated "Fan Shengzhi's Book." South China Agricultural College has studied the history of terraced fields. Northwest Agricultural College has "Modern Explanation of Fan Shengzhi's Book," "Modern Explanation of Qimin Yaoshu," "Organization of Flower Mirror," and "Annotation of Nong Yan Zhu Shi." There are also many papers scattered in various academic journals. These studies are all in line with the requirements of the "Plan for Organizing the Cause of Chinese Agricultural Scientific Heritage." Some of the research has analyzed and critically examined some important ancient books and the valuable agricultural knowledge recorded in them, which have been buried and difficult to understand for thousands of years, and some have also made summaries. Some studies have introduced the long history and superior functions of area fields, terraced fields, and soil and water conservation in our country, as well as the development history of certain major crops. This series of excavations of the agricultural heritage of the motherland has undoubtedly played a certain role in increasing agricultural production, directly or indirectly. The achievement of these preliminary results is the result of the leadership and promotion of the great and wise Party.

Both medicine and agriculture in the motherland have a long history and unique and rich content. In recent years, under the attention of the Party, Chinese medicine has been further developed and promoted by combining Chinese and Western medicine. For thousands of years, the working people of the motherland have had many valuable experiences and creations in agriculture, and many outstanding agronomists have made theoretical summaries. Since liberation, the working people have become their own masters, and the development of agricultural technology has entered a process of sudden change, and it has advanced by leaps and bounds. However, some of us in the agricultural sector still seem to have a phenomenon of "valuing foreign things over Chinese things." The Party's socialist educational policy is very wise and correct, and in particular, it calls on us to learn from the peasants, which is of even greater significance. However, while we are summing up the miracles of abundant harvests of the working people today, it is also inappropriate to not pay attention to studying the experiences proven by the working people in historical production struggles and the principles summarized by agronomists.

Recently, the People's Daily published an article by Mr. Cheng Yusi saying: "Believing in the ancients, indulging in old paper piles, and escaping from reality will eventually lead to 'knowing the past but not knowing the present,' and will never have much success. However, forgetting ancestors, severing history, and adopting a nihilistic attitude towards the scientific and cultural heritage of mankind cannot be considered Marxists." I hope that our agricultural sector will, under the leadership of the Party and under the principle of "making the past serve the present," conscientiously organize and study the agricultural heritage of the motherland, so that we can more easily understand the process of agricultural development in China and the creative spirit of the working people.

The agricultural heritage of the motherland is mostly preserved in the practice of the working people. As for the records in the classics, in addition to being scattered in "local chronicles" and classics, history, philosophy, and collections, those belonging to the category of agricultural books: According to the preliminary records of the "Bibliography of Chinese Agricultural Books" by Beijing Agricultural University, there are more than 470 kinds in total, 224 kinds of which still exist; 143 kinds have been lost; 9 kinds have been collected; and about 100 kinds whose existence or loss needs to be further investigated. Among them, "Zhao Ren Ben Ye" in the era of Wu Zetian was a popular agricultural book at that time (it is said that Japan still has it). Another example is the outstanding scholar Wang Chuanshan's "Nan Chuang Wai Ji," which may still be preserved among the people. These can only be collected by the library community. The most lost books are in the field of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine: 52 kinds have been lost; only 9 kinds have been preserved or partially preserved; and 14 kinds whose existence or loss are to be investigated. The loss of records of this kind of breeding and medical experience is a loss to our vigorous development of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. The most preserved books are in the horticulture and flower part, which may be of great reference value for the socialist landscaping construction of our country. The "Bibliography of Chinese Agricultural Books" of Beijing Agricultural University has not yet included books related to farmland water conservancy and soil and water conservation, which can be supplemented later.

The agricultural heritage of our country is so rich and colorful, and today, under the shining light of socialism, the achievements of agriculture are so great. Our agricultural sector has the responsibility to extract the essence from the agricultural heritage of the motherland, discard its dross, and combine it with the highest achievements of modern science to compile a set of agricultural technology books for the new China. Now that the Party calls for the compilation of agricultural specialty textbooks to be combined with the agricultural heritage of China, the work of organizing the agricultural heritage of the motherland also needs to be further developed. The following are some immature opinions on the work of organizing the agricultural heritage of the motherland at the present stage:

(1) Strengthen the unified leadership of the Party and establish a unified leading body: In the past, various research institutions did not have enough contact and could not exert collective strength. If the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences or the Chinese Academy of Sciences establishes an institute or research office in the future to uniformly lead the work of relevant research and organization of the agricultural heritage of the motherland in various colleges and research institutions, and fully exert the potential of human and material resources, it will certainly be more in line with the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and will not repeat or take detours.

(2) Organization of comprehensive agricultural books: Comprehensive agricultural books appeared in our country as early as the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, such as the four articles of "Shang Nong" in "Lüshi Chunqiu." After that, there were "Fan Shengzhi's Book" in the Han Dynasty, "Qimin Yaoshu" in the Later Wei Dynasty, and "Chen Fu's Book of Agriculture" in the Song Dynasty, and "Complete Treatise on Agriculture" in the Ming Dynasty. They all summarized the practical experience of the working people of the predecessors or contemporaries. Their richness and greatness cannot be compared with any country in the same era in the world. The basic principles of writing these books are mostly similar to what "Qimin Yaoshu" said: "Gathering from the classics" - examining relevant records in the literature; "Even and ballads" - referring to the experience of the masses without written records, and agricultural proverbs obtained from practice; "Asking the elders" - learning from experienced old farmers; "Verifying the actions" - and observing practice by oneself. The writing methods of these agricultural books were indeed very careful, and the authors had many outstanding insights when writing: For example, Jia Xie of the Northern Wei Dynasty said, "If you follow the seasons and measure the benefits of the land, you will use less effort and achieve more success," which illustrates the principle of adapting agriculture to the seasons and adapting to the local conditions; Chen Fu of the late Northern Song Dynasty said, "In farming, steal the time and benefits of heaven and earth... It is said that you should not rise before the time; you should not shrink after the time. Therefore, agricultural affairs must know the time and seasons of heaven and earth. Then there is nothing that cannot be achieved in life, storage, growth, education, completion, and ripening." It illustrates the spirit of fighting against nature and man will conquer nature; Xu Guangqi's "Irrigation of Dry Fields":"Irrigation has methods... This is to save from drought, equalize the water in the fields, and the water and soil are compatible... This is to eliminate drought... Dredging and controlling can store and release, this is to save from floods. In the months of the three summers, heavy rains often occur, which is the time for agricultural fields to use water. If the land is cultivated everywhere, and the ditches are crisscrossed, water is stored in the middle to support its irrigation, and the water of the rivers will be reduced greatly. The late minister Zhou Yong said: 'If everyone in the world manages the fields, then everyone will manage the rivers.'" It is an extremely fine method of soil and water conservation. Other principles and principles recorded in comprehensive agricultural books are too numerous to mention. In the past stage of organizing the agricultural heritage of the motherland, the organization and summary of comprehensive agricultural books has completed a part. If we adhere to the principle of "making the past serve the present" in the future and analyze and criticize it with the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism, systematically summarizing the essence of the agricultural heritage of the motherland and scientific theories for the reference of agricultural workers is also very meaningful. The Northwest Agricultural College has searched for the principles and principles of adapting to the seasons and adapting to the local conditions in which the working people have made achievements in agriculture for thousands of years from agricultural books, systematically linked them together, and initially made a "Agricultural Book System Diagram," and initially drafted a "Outline for Studying the Excellent Traditions of the Agricultural Heritage of the Motherland from the Standard of the Eight-Character Constitution" for research, attached at the end, hoping that comrades will give guidance.

However, the organization of this kind of systematic and comprehensive agricultural book has complex content and requires the cooperation of many parties, especially the vigorous help of comrades who study natural sciences.

(3) On the organization of professional agricultural books: such as animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, sericulture, tea, citrus, etc., it can be completed by professional institutions. In addition, agricultural books with local characteristics can be completed by a local institution, such as "Research on Supplement to the Book of Agriculture" and "Annotation of Nong Yan Zhu Shi," which have achieved great results because they are easy to understand the actual situation of the local area.

(4) On the organization of agricultural proverbs and local chronicles: Agricultural proverbs "are agricultural books written by farmers in our country throughout the ages, and are a treasure house of agricultural knowledge in our country. If agricultural proverbs from all over the country are comprehensively and systematically organized and studied, and annotated with modern scientific knowledge, a excellent Chinese agricultural book can be compiled" (quoted from Beijing Agricultural University's "Achievements of Ancient Chinese Agricultural Science"). The Party attaches great importance to the collection of agricultural proverbs and the copying of agricultural information in local "local chronicles." These are indeed important materials in our agricultural heritage. If we use the method of bottom-up, local research institutions will first organize and annotate, and then the central leading body will centrally select and extract its essence, so that we can summarize some very valuable knowledge.

My personal knowledge of Chinese and foreign agriculture is extremely superficial. The above-mentioned one-sided views are for reference only. Finally, I wish the conference a victory! I wish the comrades good health! Attachment 1: "Agricultural Book System Diagram" Attachment 2: "Outline for Studying the Excellent Traditions of the Agricultural Heritage of the Motherland from the Standard of the Eight-Character Constitution" 1. Basic Principles: "Man will conquer nature"
        (1) Adapt to the seasons: Use stellar signs and phenology as seasonal indicators
        (2) Adapt to local conditions:
                1. Understanding of soil properties: ① Earliest classification (Yu Gong) ② Indicator plants (Di Yuan) ③ Cultivation improvement (Shang Nong)
                2. Utilization of poor land: ① Irrigation (water) ② Washing away saline-alkali (Shi Qi) (soil)
                3. Special technical measures: ① Terraces (water) ② Intercropping (dense) ③ Intercropping (dense) ④ Area planting (soil) 2. Direction of exerting human effort:
        1. Follow the seasons and measure the benefits of the land: (Developed from Fan Shengzhi's "Seek time and harmony with the soil" and "Planting crops without a fixed period, depending on the time according to the land.")
        2. "Deep plowing and easy hoeing" and "Cultivate or plant" (soil conservation).
        3. Utilize green manure, manure, compost, and various organic matter (legume intercropping) (fertilizer)
        4. Seed selection (seed) and seedling training (management)
        5. Utilize asexual reproduction to overcome climate restrictions (ginger, taro, sweet potato, sugarcane) (protection, management)
        6. Carefully store harvested products (cellar storage, warehousing) (protection) and processing (drying, fresh, pickling) (management)
        7. Diversified management - "Planting must be mixed with five kinds," in addition, attention should be paid to sericulture, oil crops, fibers, coatings, timber, poultry, livestock, and brewing (management) at the same time
        8. Grafting (seed)
        9. Protection (frost prevention, frost scraping, pest removal, veterinary medicine) (protection)
        10. Greenhouse cultivation of vegetables and flowers (protection, management) 3. Achievements made:
        1. Rich varieties: ① Grains, vegetables, fruits, oil crops, fibers, flowers, medicinal materials, trees... all have excellent varieties that the world does not have. ② Special cases of introducing new varieties: grapes and alfalfa in the Han Dynasty... vegetables and fruits in the Tang Dynasty (those marked with the word "Hu" were mostly imported in the Han Dynasty; those marked with the word "Fan" were mostly imported in the Tang Dynasty; those marked with the word "Hai" were mostly imported in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties; those marked with the word "Yang" were mostly imported in the Qing and modern times), Champa rice imported during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty (Champa rice), cotton imported in the early Yuan Dynasty... ③ Domestication of wild plants ④ Utilization - (disaster preparedness) 2. Farmland water conservancy (water, engineering) 3. Agricultural tools

### 在“古为今用”的原则下  如何整理祖国农学遗产  辛树帜委员的发言

    在“古为今用”的原则下  如何整理祖国农学遗产
    辛树帜委员的发言
    各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的报告。
    自一九五四年党号召我们农学界，整理祖国农学遗产，各农业院、校以及农业科学研究机关，才开始重视这一问题。一九五五年四月，中央农业部邀集各方面的专家学者在北京座谈了整理祖国农学遗产的具体办法。此后中国科学院植物研究所、北京农业大学、南京农学院、华南农学院、西北农学院等有少数对中国古籍较有修养的老教师或青年教师，小型组合，在党的领导和支持鼓舞下，从事这一艰巨而光荣伟大的工作，几年来取得了不少的成绩。
    中国科学院植物研究所，已将公元前三、四世纪的“管子”“地员”篇和保存于“吕氏春秋”的“上农”等四篇作了校释；北京农业大学出版了“中国农学书录”、“区种十种”以及“秦晋农言”等；南京农学院中国农业遗产研究室出版了“补农书研究”、编辑了中国农学遗产选集稻、麦、棉三种以及辑释了“汜胜之书”；华南农学院研究了梯田的历史；西北农学院有“泛胜之书今释”、“齐民要术今释”，“花镜整理”、“农言著实注释”等；其他散见于各学报的论文，为数也不少。这些研究都是符合于“整理中国农业科学遗产事业规划”要求的。有一部分研究已把数千年沈埋难读难懂的一些重要古籍及其中记载的宝贵农业知识，分析、批判，有的还作了总结。有一部分研究介绍了祖国历史悠久而优越的区田、梯田和水土保持的功用以及某些主要作物的发展史等等。这一系列的祖国农学遗产的发掘，无疑的或多或少直接间接对农学增产起了一定的作用。这些初步成绩的获得，都是伟大英明的党的领导和提倡的结果。
    祖国的医学和农学，都有其悠久的历史和独特的丰富内容，几年来中国的医学在党的重视下，中西结合更发扬光大了。祖国的农业，几千年来劳动人民有许多宝贵的经验和创造，也有许多杰出的农学家，作了理论性的总结。自解放后，劳动人民自己当家作主，农业技术的发展，更进入了突变过程，已飞跃式的前进。但是我们农学界的人士，似乎还有点“厚外薄中”的现象。党的社会主义的教育方针，是十分英明而正确的，尤其号召我们拜农民为师，意义更是深长。但是我们在总结今日劳动人民丰产奇迹的同时；而不注意研究历史上劳动人民从生产斗争实践中证实过的经验和农学家总结过的原理原则，也是不恰当的。
    最近人民日报刊载了成于思先生的文章说：“迷信古人，沉醉于故纸堆中，逃避现实，到头是‘知古不知今’，固然是永远不会有多大出息。但是忘掉祖宗，割断历史，对人类科学文化遗产采取了一种虚无主义的态度，也不算是马克思主义者。”我希望我们农学界在党的领导下，在“古为今用”的原则下，认真地整理和学习祖国农学遗产，使我们更容易体会中国农业发展的过程和劳动人民的创造精神。
    祖国农学遗产，大部分保存在劳动人民的实践中。至于典籍记载，除散见于“方志”以及经、史、子、集外，属于农书范畴的：据北京农大的“中国农学书录”的初步记载，共有四百七十余种，现存者二百二十四种；佚失者一百四十三种；辑佚九种；存佚尚待进一步调查的约百余种。其中像武则天时代的“兆人本业”，是当时民间流传的一部农书（据闻日本尚有），又如杰出的学者王船山氏的“南窗外记”可能还留存在民间，这些只有待于图书界的搜罗了。佚失以畜牧兽医部分为最多：失传的五十二种；保存及残存的仅九种；存佚待调查的十四种。这种饲养医疗经验的记载的佚去，在我们大力发展畜牧兽医事业方面是一种损失。保存最多的书籍，要算园艺花卉部分，这对我国社会主义的园林化的建设，或有极大的参考价值。北京农大的“中国农学书录”中，尚未将有关农田水利及水土保持的书籍列入，以后似可补充。
    我国农学遗产既如是的丰富多采，而今日在社会主义的光辉照耀下，农业的成就，又如是的伟大；我们农学界，从祖国农学遗产中摘取其精华：扬弃其糟粕，结合现代科学的最高成就，编成一套新中国的农业技术书是有责任的。党现号召编写农学专科教科书应结合中国农学遗产，那么，整理祖国农学遗产的工作，也需要进一步的开展。兹提出个人对现阶段整理祖国农学遗产的工作一些不成熟的意见：
    （一）加强党的统一领导，并设立统一领导机构：过去阶段各个研究机构，联系不够，不能发挥集体力量。此后如果由中国农业科学院或中国科学院设立研究所或研究室，统一领导各院校及研究机构的有关研究整理祖国农学遗产方面的工作，充分发挥人力物力的潜力，一定更能符合“多快好省”的原则，而不至重复或走弯路。
    （二）综合性的农书的整理：我国公元前三、四世纪，即有综合性的农书出现，如“吕氏春秋”“上农”等四篇。此后若汉之“泛胜之书”、后魏的“齐民要术”、及宋之“陈旉农书”，明之“农政全书”等。都是总结前人或当代的劳动人民的实践经验；其丰富伟大是世界同时代任何国家所不能比拟的。这些书的写作基本原则，大多类似“齐民要术”所说的：“采捃经传”——考查文献中的有关记录；“爰及歌谣”——参照无文字记载的群众经验，而由实践中得来的农谚；“询之老成”——向有经验的老农学习；“验之行事”——而且自己观察实践。这些农书的写作方法固然很精慎，而作者写作时又有许多卓越的识见：如北魏贾勰的“顺天时，量地利，则用力少而成功多”，说明了农业的因时制宜，因地制宜的原则性；北宋末陈旉的“在耕稼盗天地之时利……传曰，不先时而起；不后时而缩。故农事必知天地时宜。则生之蓄之，长之育之，成之熟之，无不遂矣”。说明了向自然斗争，人定胜天的精神；徐光启的“旱田用水疏”：“灌溉有法……此救旱也，均水田间，水土相得……此弭旱也……疏理节宣，可蓄可泄，此救潦也。三夏之月，大雨时行，正农田用水之候，若遍地耕垦，沟洫纵横，畜水于中，资其灌溉，必减大川之水。 先臣周用曰：‘使天下人人治田，则人人治河也。’”是水土保持的极精方法，其他见于综合性农书方面的原理原则性记载，不胜枚举。在过去阶段整理祖国农学遗产中，综合性的农书整理和总结已完成了一部分，今后如果坚持“古为今用”的原则，用马克思、列宁主义的观点分析批判，系统的总结祖国农学遗产的精华和富有科学性的理论，以供农学工作者的参考，也是很有意义的。西北农学院曾从农书中，找寻几千年来劳动人民在农业上有成就的因时因地制宜的原理原则，把它们系统的联系起来，初步制成了一个“农书系统图”，又初步拟出“用八字宪法的标准看祖国农学的优良传统”以待研究的一个提纲，附录在后，希望同志们指教。
    不过这一类系统性综合性的农书整理，内容复杂，是需要多方面的协作，尤其是需要研究自然科学方面的同志大力帮助。
    （三）关于专业性农书的整理：如畜牧、兽医、蚕桑、茶、柑橘等等，似可由专业机构完成。又富有地方性的农书，可由某一地方机构完成，例如“补农书研究”、“农言著实注释”等，都有很大的成绩，因易于理解当地的实际情况的缘故。
    （四）关于农谚与方志的整理：农谚“是我国历代农民自己写出的农书，是我国农业知识的一个宝藏，如果将全国各地的农谚，加以全面的有系统的整理和研究，并且用现代科学知识注释出来，就可以编成一部出色的中国农书”（引北京农大“中国古代农业科学的成就”）。党是非常注重农谚的收集以及地方“方志”中有关农学资料的抄录，这些的确是我国农学遗产中的重要资料，如果运用由下而上的方法，由地方研究机构先行整理注释，再由中央领导机构集中选择、采其精华，这样我们又可以总结一些很有价值的知识。
    个人对中外农学的知识，都是极其肤浅的，上面所说的这一些片面的看法，谨提供参考。最后祝大会胜利！同志们身体健康！附件一：“农书系统图”附件二：“用八字宪法的标准，看祖国农学的优良传统”提纲一、基本原则：“人定胜天”
