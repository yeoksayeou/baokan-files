Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th: The peak of this year's Yellow River peach blossom flood entered the sea at Lijin at 14:00 on the 6th. This flood peak reached Huayuankou on the 2nd, with a water level of 92.70 meters and a flow rate of 3,100 cubic meters per second. It reached Luokou, Shandong on the 5th, with a water level of 27.59 meters and a flow rate of 3,380 cubic meters per second.

Due to the importance attached to the defense work by Party and government leaders at all levels, although the Yellow River's water level this year is 0.3 to 0.5 meters higher and the flow rate is 600 to 2,000 cubic meters per second greater than in the same period of previous years, the river projects remained stable and safe during the passage of the flood peak. The wheat seedlings on both banks were also well protected.

    黄河桃汛洪峰入海
    新华社郑州9日电　今年黄河桃汛洪峰已在6日十四时过利津入海。这次洪峰2日到达花园口，水位九十二点七零公尺，流量三千一百秒公方，5日到山东泺口，水位二十七点五九公尺，流量三千三百八十秒公方。
    由于各级党政领导重视防守工作，今年黄河水位虽然较往年同期高零点三到零点五公尺，流量大六百到二千秒公方，但在洪峰通过期间，沿河工程都平稳无险。两岸麦苗也保护得很好。
