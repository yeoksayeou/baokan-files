Government Work Report
Delivered at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress on April 18, 1959
By Premier Zhou Enlai

Comrades,

I am now reporting to the First Session of the Second National People's Congress on behalf of the State Council.

1. The Great Achievements of the First Five-Year Plan Period and the First Year of the Second Five-Year Plan—1958

During the more than four years of the First National People's Congress, our country has undergone a series of significant historical changes.

When the First National People's Congress convened in 1954, socialist economy had already taken the leading position in our national economy. However, there were still large amounts of capitalist industry and commerce, and individual agriculture and handicrafts. The mutual aid movement in the countryside had already spread widely, with about 60% of the households participating in agricultural mutual aid teams. However, only about 2% of the households had joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. At that time, our country had completed the task of economic recovery and had started large-scale, planned economic construction. However, whether we could establish the foundation of socialist industrialization in such a short period for a country with over 600 million people was yet to be proven by facts. Now, everyone can see that after just over four years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved such glorious achievements in both socialist revolution and socialist construction!

In 1955 and 1956, our country carried out comprehensive socialist transformations of capitalist industry and commerce, agriculture, and handicrafts, basically completing the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production. Now, except for a few minority areas, our country basically has only two forms of ownership of the means of production: socialist state ownership and socialist collective ownership. In 1957 and the first half of 1958, the Chinese people carried out the nationwide rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, achieving great victories in the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts. Thus, in the struggle between the two roads, socialism has basically triumphed over capitalism in all aspects.

Our socialist construction is carried out simultaneously with and promotes the socialist revolution. From 1953 to 1957, our country implemented the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. When we proposed this plan, imperialists declared it to be a doomed fantasy. However, in fact, we not only completed this plan ahead of schedule in 1957 but also started implementing an even more ambitious Second Five-Year Plan in 1958.

Due to the completion and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, our country's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 1,387.4 billion yuan in 1957, an increase of 68% compared to 827.1 billion yuan in 1952. Among these, industrial output value reached 650.2 billion yuan, an increase of 141% compared to 270.1 billion yuan in 1952; handicraft output value reached 133.7 billion yuan, an increase of 83% compared to 73.1 billion yuan in 1952; agricultural output value reached 603.5 billion yuan, an increase of 25% compared to 483.9 billion yuan in 1952.

The total investment in basic construction of the economic and cultural sectors by the state during the First Five-Year Plan period amounted to 493 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan of 427.4 billion yuan by 15.3%. Over five years, 10,000-plus industrial and mining construction projects were started, of which 921 were above the designated scale, 227 more than the planned number of projects; by the end of 1957, 537 of the above-scale industrial and mining construction projects had been fully or partially completed and put into production.

Due to the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, we not only greatly strengthened the existing industrial sectors but also began to establish many new industrial sectors that did not exist before, such as metallurgical equipment manufacturing, mining equipment manufacturing, power generation equipment manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, advanced machine tool manufacturing, as well as high-grade alloy steel smelting and important non-ferrous metal smelting, etc. Technical strength has also increased significantly. In 1957, the number of engineering and technical personnel in the national industry reached 175,000, an increase of 100% compared to 58,000 in 1952; the number of workers and staff in industry and basic construction reached 10,119,000, an increase of 66% compared to 6,115,000 in 1952. Due to the increase in industrial output and the addition of new varieties, the self-sufficiency rate of industrial materials and equipment has also been improved, such as the self-sufficiency rate of steel in 1957 has reached 86%, and the self-sufficiency rate of mechanical equipment has reached more than 60%. At the same time, the proportion of industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry has undergone important changes.

In the total industrial and agricultural output value, the proportion of industry and handicrafts increased from 41.5% in 1952 to 56.5% in 1957. In the total industrial output value, the proportion of means of production industry increased from 39.7% in 1952 to 52.8% in 1957.

Therefore, it can be said that due to the completion and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, our country has established the preliminary foundation of socialist industrialization.

The first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, that is, 1958, saw an unprecedented leap in our national economy.

In 1958, our country's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 2,050 billion yuan, an increase of 65% compared to 1,241 billion yuan in 1957. Among these, the total industrial and handicraft output value reached 1,170 billion yuan, an increase of 66% compared to 704 billion yuan in 1957; the output of products such as pig iron, steel, coal, power generation equipment, locomotives, automobiles, and power machinery all increased by more than 100% compared to 1957, including a part of pig iron and steel being crude iron and crude steel. The total agricultural output value reached 880 billion yuan, an increase of 64% compared to 537 billion yuan in 1957; the output of products such as grain, cotton, and flue-cured tobacco also all increased by more than 100% compared to 1957. Through the state budget, the total investment in basic construction reached 214 billion yuan, an increase of 70% compared to 126 billion yuan in 1957.

Many industrial and agricultural products increased in quantity in 1958 more than they did from 1957 to 1952. For example, from 1957 to 1952, steel increased by 400 million tons, coal increased by 640 million tons, machine tools (excluding simple machine tools) increased by 14,300 units, grain increased by 612 billion jin, and cotton increased by 67.3 million dan; while from 1958 to 1957, steel increased by 573 million tons, coal increased by 140 million tons, machine tools increased by 22,000 units, grain increased by 380 billion jin, and cotton increased by 335.8 million dan.

Alongside the leap in industry and agriculture, significant progress was also made in transportation, postal services, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings.

In 1958, our country made a great creation in social organization, which is the establishment of people's communes in rural areas across the country based on the demand of the broad masses of peasants. More than 120 million peasant households, on the basis of agricultural production cooperativization, further formed more than 26,000 large-scale, integrated, and unified people's communes that combine industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. The people's commune is a form of organization that emerged to meet the needs of the great development of industry and agriculture in our country. It will have extremely significant implications for the development of our country's social economy. Under our country's conditions, it is not only the best form to promote the continuous development of productive forces, accelerate socialist construction, but also the best form for the transition from socialist collective ownership to state ownership in rural areas across the country, and from a socialist society to a communist society in the future.

Obviously, the development of our national economy in 1958 is not just a general advance, but a great and comprehensive leap.

The speed of development of our national economy is something that has never been seen and is impossible under the capitalist system. Take steel, for example. Britain, as early as 1880, had an annual output of 13.1 million tons, but it took until 1935 for the annual output to reach 102 million tons. Our country's steel output was 13.5 million tons in 1952, but it increased to 1,108 million tons in 1958. This means that in terms of steel output, Britain took more than 50 years, while we only took 6 years. Take coal, for example. Britain, as early as 1854, could already produce 657 million tons, roughly equal to our country's production level of 664.9 million tons in 1952. After more than 50 years, by 1907, Britain's coal output reached 2.7 billion tons, while our country only took 6 years to reach this level in 1958. Britain's coal output in the early 20th century had twice approached 3 billion tons, but in the past 20-plus years, it has been in a state of decline and stagnation, reaching only about 2.2 billion tons in 1958, already lagging behind our country.

Imperialists, especially American imperialists, have tried to deny our country's great leap forward in the national economy because they know that this fact will inevitably strengthen the confidence of people around the world in the superiority of socialism and deepen doubts about the capitalist system. When they cannot deny the fact of the great leap forward, they distort and slander our great leap forward in various ways. No matter how hard they rack their brains, they will not achieve their goals. They say we have implemented slave labor here. Originally, workers and peasants working voluntarily and enthusiastically for their own happiness is called "slave labor," while being forced to work for capitalists and landlords under the threat of hunger is called "free labor." But why is it that in the vast "free" labor force of the Western world, there is so much sorrow and pain, while in the so-called "slave" labor force of socialism, there is so much joy and hope? They say we have sacrificed the living standards of the broad masses. But when the capitalist world is plagued by unemployment, the socialist system not only fundamentally eliminates the phenomenon of long-term unemployment left over from our old society but also guarantees that the living standards of our 600 million-plus people will gradually improve with the development of production. In the great leap forward of 1958, the average annual number of workers and staff increased by about 8 million compared to the previous year, and the expansion of the urban employment market reached an unprecedented level; in rural areas, millions of female laborers were liberated from household chores and participated in agricultural production; but due to the comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the pace of mechanization in our country could not be so fast, the urban and rural labor force still felt insufficient. The income of our people has increased significantly, and social purchasing power has greatly increased, with the total retail sales of social commodities increasing by 16% compared to the previous year. It is particularly worth noting that during our leap forward in the means of production industry, the output value of consumer goods industry increased by 34% in 1958. Such a rate of increase, has the capitalist world ever had it? Let the old gentlemen of the Western bourgeoisie shout, our workers and peasants, except for losing the freedom of unemployment and hunger, have lost nothing else.

The reasons for our great leap forward are something that imperialists cannot understand and do not want to understand. What are the reasons for our great leap forward?

The great leap forward of 1958 appeared on the basis of the victory of the socialist revolution and the completion of the First Five-Year Plan. Our country has been "poor and blank" in economy and culture for a long time, not because we lack manpower and natural resources, but because we lack a social system that can adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces. Everyone knows that our country has a large population, rich resources, and good climatic conditions, all of which are very favorable for the development of productive forces. However, the same population and geographical conditions, not only in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, could not have any leap forward; even after liberation, before the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and individual agriculture and handicrafts, and before the revolutionary victory on the political and ideological fronts, it was also impossible to have a 1958-style great leap forward. At the same time, due to the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, a number of large-scale modernized backbone enterprises have been built, and a number of personnel who can master new technologies have been trained. We are already able to design and build some relatively large-scale and technologically complex industrial enterprises ourselves, such as steel and iron combined enterprises with an annual output of 150 million tons of steel, coal mines with an annual output of 240 million tons of coal, hydropower stations with a total installed capacity of 1 million kilowatts and thermal power stations with 650,000 kilowatts, etc. Without such material and technological foundations, we would not have had the great leap forward of 1958.

However, the most important reason for the great leap forward of 1958 is that in the spring of 1958, we summarized the experience of the First Five-Year Plan, began to find a better way to build socialism in our country, and formulated the general line of building socialism with great effort, striving to catch up and surpass, and building socialism in a way that is fast, good, and economical. The general line formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong is a line that fully estimates the enthusiasm of more than 600 million people for building socialism after the victory of the socialist revolution, mobilizing all positive factors to the fullest. The great leap forward of 1958 appeared under the guidance of this general line.

According to the general line, in the industrial sector, we implemented the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry under the guidance of putting steel as the key link and achieving an overall leap forward. Steel is currently the most important material in industrial production and basic construction, and the shortage of steel in our country hinders the development of the entire national economy. Therefore, in 1958, we mobilized the strength of the whole people to increase steel production, making the steel output increase from 535 million tons in 1957 to 1,108 million tons. The leap forward in steel production directly promoted the leap forward in the coal industry and created the conditions for the simultaneous leap forward of the machinery industry and other industries. Why could the steel industry and other industries have such a high rate of development? This is because, in the industrial sector, we implemented the policy of simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, large enterprises and medium and small enterprises, and modern production and traditional production, and in industrial management, we implemented the method of combining centralized leadership with mass movements. This has found a specific path for the fast, good, and economical development of industry. In 1958, we expanded the authority of local management of industrial construction and industrial production, thereby greatly enhancing the enthusiasm of local organizations and the masses at all levels to develop industry, greatly accelerating the pace of construction, and rapidly increasing industrial output. In 1958, there were more than 1,000 new and expanded industrial and mining enterprises above the designated scale jointly established by the central government and the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, of which about 700 were fully or partially completed and put into production, more than the total of 537 industrial and mining enterprises fully or partially completed and put into production during the First Five-Year Plan period; provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, prefectures, and counties established a large number of industrial and mining units below the designated scale that combine modern and traditional methods, and most of these industrial and mining units were completed or partially completed and put into production in 1958. In addition, people's communes also established many industrial and mining units that are basically produced by traditional methods. Due to these constructions, the industrial production capacity of our country has rapidly increased.

Of course, the leap forward in industry in 1958 mainly relied on the increased production of existing enterprises. In existing enterprises, through the expansion of equipment, the increase of manpower, the improvement of management, the improvement of equipment utilization rate and labor productivity, the output has greatly increased. A large number of enterprises implemented the method of workers participating in management, cadres participating in production, and the combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses, launching a mass movement to improve operating techniques, improve equipment, improve product design, rationally use raw materials, materials, fully utilize existing equipment, trial-produce and produce new products, improve production organization, and reform unreasonable regulations and systems, thereby greatly tapping the production potential of existing industrial enterprises.

The great achievements on the agricultural front in 1958 also proved the power of the socialist construction general line, proved that industry and agriculture should be developed simultaneously and can be developed simultaneously, and proved that agriculture can also develop at a high speed like industry. In fact, the leap forward of industry and agriculture in 1958 started from agriculture. Our country has few agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, but after fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the peasants, the unit yield of agricultural products can still be rapidly increased. The revised national agricultural development outline in 1957 stipulated that by 1967, the unit yield of grain in the three categories of regions across the country should reach 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin respectively, and the unit yield of cotton should reach 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin respectively. In fact, in 1958, most counties and cities across the country had already achieved the grain production targets stipulated in the agricultural development outline ahead of schedule, and most cotton-producing areas across the country had also achieved the cotton production targets stipulated in the agricultural development outline ahead of schedule. In 1958, grain and cotton both had many high-yield fields.

The measures taken by the peasant masses to increase the unit yield include soil (soil), fertilizer (fertilizer), water (irrigation), seed (seed), density (dense planting), protection (plant protection), management (field management), and tools (tool reform), which are commonly known as the "eight-character constitution" of agriculture. In terms of soil, a large amount of work has been done in deep plowing, improving soil quality, and leveling land. In terms of fertilizer, more sources of fertilizer have been opened up compared to previous years, and a large number of small-scale factories and workshops for manufacturing and processing various fertilizers have been established. In terms of irrigation, the irrigated area across the country in 1958 increased by 4.8 billion mu, an increase of more than 90%. In terms of seeds, the main crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton have basically popularized high-quality seeds, and high-quality seeds have been exchanged between various regions. In terms of dense planting, different degrees of dense planting have been widely implemented, and many experiences have been gained in the experiments of reasonable dense planting. In terms of plant protection and pest control, a large amount of work has been done. Field management in 1958 has made remarkable achievements; various places have promoted high-yield fields and experimental fields, and some places have tried to cultivate fields in a garden-like manner, all of which have played an active role in the agricultural technological revolution. Tool reform has made initial progress across the country; the promotion of car transportation and ball bearings has been welcomed by the peasants; various new agricultural tools have emerged in large numbers.

The various measures to increase production in industry and agriculture could be promoted and effective because they were inseparable from the close connection between the Party and the masses and the improvement of the masses' socialist consciousness caused by the rectification movement. The principle of Party committee leadership and political command has been accepted by the broad masses. Across the country, methods such as cadres participating in physical labor, cadres planting experimental fields, cadres being sent down, and cadres living and working with the masses have been implemented, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of workers and peasants. A series of measures have been taken on various fronts to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, advocate communist style, advocate daring to think, speak, and act, and daring to innovate and create, conduct visits and evaluations, and launch socialist competitions and cooperation. All of these have strongly promoted the high tide of production and construction, ensuring the realization of the comprehensive leap forward of the national economy.

In the cause of socialist construction in our country, the various countries of the socialist camp, with the great Soviet Union at the forefront, have given us assistance in many aspects. The 166 major construction projects assisted by the Soviet Union during our First Five-Year Plan have played a significant role in the development of our economic construction. The rich experience of the Soviet Union since its founding is also an important basis for us to formulate and implement economic construction plans.

Our achievements are great. However, for a country with more than 600 million people, the level of industry and agriculture we have now reached is still very low. To meet the huge needs of economic development and improvement of people's lives, we must continue to struggle hard. The time we have spent building socialism is still short, and the time we have implemented the general line of socialist construction proposed by the Party is even shorter. Our experience is still insufficient, and there are still many shortcomings in our work. We must continue to learn humbly and have no reason to be complacent. We should, on the basis of the great victory of 1958, continue to advance along the path opened up in 1958 and strive for greater victories on all fronts in 1959.

2. Our Tasks on the Economic Front in the Second Year of the Second Five-Year Plan—1959

1959 is the year when the Chinese people, under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction, implement the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. At the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held in November 1958, the main tasks and policies for the development of the national economy in 1959 were discussed, and the four indicators of 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 105 billion jin of grain, and 1 billion dan of cotton were proposed. In early April this year, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on these indicators and the production and construction situation in the first quarter of this year, approved the draft of the 1959 national economic plan. This draft has been approved by the State Council and is submitted to this session of the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision. We believe that the main task of the people across the country this year is to actively strive to complete and over-fulfill this national economic plan centered on the four major indicators.

The 1959 national economic plan is a plan for continued leap forward. Everyone can see from the draft that the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1959 will increase by 40% compared to 2,050 billion yuan in 1958, reaching 2,870 billion yuan; among these, the total industrial and handicraft output value will be 1,650 billion yuan, and the total agricultural output value will be 1,220 billion yuan. In the 32 major industrial products, the output of 17 products such as pig iron, steel, crude oil, sulfuric acid, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics, power generation equipment, locomotives, freight cars, tractors, grain combine harvesters, powered threshers, power machinery, cotton spinning machinery, papermaking equipment, sugar-making equipment, and sugar will increase by more than 50%; the output of other products, except for a few, will also increase by more than 30%. Some products' output will increase by several times. For example, power generation equipment, which produced only 800,000 kilowatts in 1958, will produce 2.8 million to 3 million kilowatts in 1959, an increase of 250% to 275%. In major agricultural products, the output of products such as grain, cotton, hemp, jute, sugarcane, sugar beet, peanuts, rapeseed, and the number of pigs raised will increase by more than 40%.

The total investment in basic construction in 1959, through the state budget, is planned to be 270 billion yuan, an increase of 26% compared to 214 billion yuan in 1958. Among the projects above the designated scale to be constructed this year, there are a total of 1,092, including 51 steel and iron enterprises, 33 non-ferrous metal enterprises, 154 mechanical manufacturing enterprises, 184 power stations, 83 coal enterprises, 19 oil extraction and refining enterprises, 53 chemical industry enterprises, 105 building materials and timber harvesting enterprises, 161 light industry enterprises, 28 water conservancy projects, and 5,500 kilometers of new main lines, double lines, branch lines, and enterprise-dedicated lines for railways, etc. The investment in these projects above the designated scale accounts for about two-thirds of the total investment for the year. The remaining investment will be used to construct a large number of projects below the designated scale.

To provide the necessary transportation conditions for the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and basic construction, the plan stipulates that the freight volume of railways in 1959 will reach 520 million tons, an increase of 36% compared to 380 million tons in 1958; the freight volume of enterprises directly under the Ministry of Communications will reach 350 million tons, an increase of 25% compared to 280 million tons in 1958. On the basis of the continued leap forward of agricultural and light industrial production, the plan stipulates that the total retail sales of social commodities in 1959 will reach 650 billion yuan, an increase of 19% compared to 548 billion yuan in 1958.

The 1959 plan is formulated based on the general line of building socialism with great effort, striving to catch up and surpass, and building socialism in a way that is fast, good, and economical, and based on the policy of simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, central industry and local industry, large enterprises and medium and small enterprises, and modern production and traditional production. This plan considers both the objective possibilities of our country's material and technological conditions and the subjective initiative of the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm; it considers both the requirements of mutual adaptation between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, production and transportation in development, and it insists on the principle of having priorities and giving priority to the development of heavy industry, especially the development of raw material and material industries and the policy of putting steel as the key link. Producing 18 million tons of steel is the most important task on the industrial front. To achieve this task, the plan has, based on possible conditions, striven to improve the production indicators of pig iron, coal, electricity, and transportation, and has stipulated the task of rapidly manufacturing mining equipment, coal washing equipment, coking equipment, rolling equipment, power station equipment, and transportation equipment for the machinery industry. To change the situation where raw material and material industries and power industries lag behind processing industries, we have increased the growth rate of the output of products such as steel, copper, aluminum, sulfuric acid, and electricity. According to the requirement of simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, the plan stipulates that the production of means of production in 1959 will increase by 46%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 34%. For the increase in production of some daily industrial goods that are necessary for people's lives, especially those that were insufficient in production in the past period, the plan has made provisions. According to the requirement of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, the plan stipulates that the total industrial and handicraft output value in 1959 will increase by 41% compared to 1958, and the total agricultural output value will increase by 39% compared to 1958. To make the increase in various agricultural and livestock products adapt to the development of light industry and the improvement of people's living standards, in 1959, while ensuring the continued leap forward of grain and cotton production, the growth rate of crops such as hemp, sugarcane, rapeseed, and livestock such as pigs, cattle, and horses has been increased. Industry will also strengthen its support for agriculture, providing more irrigation and drainage machinery, tractors, grain combine harvesters, powered threshers, rubber-wheeled handcarts, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides.

The realization of the magnificent 1959 national economic development plan will further expand the material foundation of our socialist country, will prepare more conditions for the continuous leap forward of our industry and the mechanization of agriculture, will achieve the goal of increasing grain and cotton production stipulated in the national agricultural development outline ahead of schedule and in excess, and will ensure the continued improvement of people's material living standards.

The percentage increase in the indicators stipulated in the 1959 plan compared to the previous year is higher than the percentage increase in 1958 compared to the previous year for many products, such as electric power, sulfuric acid, chemical fertilizers, freight cars, cotton spinning machinery, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, edible vegetable oil, and sugar, and agricultural products such as hemp, jute, sugarcane, rapeseed, large livestock, and pigs. There are also some products whose percentage increase in planned output in 1959 is lower than in 1958, but the absolute increase is higher. For example, the output of steel increased by 107% in 1958 compared to 1957, an increase of 573 million tons; in 1959, it is planned to increase by 62% compared to 1958, but the absolute increase is 692 million tons. The situation of the total industrial and agricultural output value is also like this: in 1958, it increased by 65% compared to 1957, an increase of 809 billion yuan; in 1959, it is planned to increase by 40% compared to 1958, but the absolute increase is 820 billion yuan. It can be seen that when observing the growth rate, one cannot only look at the percentage but must also look at the absolute number. If one thinks that the total industrial and agricultural output value and the output of each product must increase by a higher percentage each year than the previous year to be considered a leap forward, that is not practical.

Not only that, but for some industrial and agricultural products, especially for some agricultural products, in the process of leap forward, the output increase in the latter year may also be lower than the output increase in the previous year. The 1959 plan requires a 40% increase in grain production, which is undoubtedly a very high and rarely seen speed in history. One should see that the increase in grain production is greatly restricted by natural conditions, and it is impossible to double the increase year after year or to increase by the absolute amount of 1958 each year. Under the condition that agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers are still few, even if the increase is 10% to 20% each year, it would already be considered a leap forward. The absolute increase in grain in 1959 will reach 300 billion jin, which is a very large number. Everyone knows that the total grain output in our country, in the year with the highest production before liberation, 1936, was only 2,774 billion jin. After liberation and the recovery of the economy in 1952, it was still only 3,088 billion jin. After the efforts during the First Five-Year Plan period, it reached 3,700 billion jin in 1957. Now we want to increase the grain production by 300 billion jin on the basis of the 3,800 billion jin increase in 1958, which is undoubtedly a leap forward plan that requires great effort to achieve.

To achieve the high-speed, large-scale 1959 plan, the people across the country must continue to struggle bravely, work hard, work smart, and strive to overcome difficulties. In the great development of the national economy, it is impossible not to encounter difficulties, and this is even more so in our country, which is economically backward and has a thin foundation. In the current period, the situation where many important raw materials, materials, electricity, and transportation capacity cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the national economy will not be fundamentally changed soon, which is one of the difficulties we face. In addition, we may also encounter some unforeseen difficulties, such as suffering serious natural disasters in agriculture. We should be fully prepared for these difficulties and strive to overcome them. As long as we are prepared and strive to overcome them, then no difficulties can stop us from achieving victory.

We have many favorable conditions for completing the 1959 plan. The great leap forward of 1958 has created the general premise for our continued leap forward. We have a stronger material and technological foundation than in 1958. We have people's communes that can promote the development of social productive forces. More than 600 million people, due to the victories on various fronts in 1958, have greater confidence and enthusiasm, more experience and methods. The general line of socialist construction and a set of "two-legged" policies formulated by the Party have been grasped by more cadres and masses after the practice of 1958. All of these are our favorable conditions.

To achieve the 1959 plan, what issues should we pay attention to? The most important issue at present is to strengthen centralized leadership, make overall arrangements, grasp various organizational tasks and specific measures, and vigorously launch mass movements on various economic fronts.

On the industrial front, it is especially necessary to strengthen centralized leadership to combine the strength of the central government and local governments, the strength of the state and the masses, and make overall arrangements according to the requirements of the unified national plan, first ensuring the needs of key construction and the completion of overall tasks.

Due to the victory of the socialist revolution, the inspiration of the general line of socialist construction, and the success of the people's commune system, the enthusiasm of cadres and masses on various local and front lines has reached an unprecedented level, and everyone wants to quickly develop the construction they need. This demand is completely understandable and reflects the thriving situation of our country. However, our plan must be based on objective possibilities. Our material and technological foundation is still very weak. Our manpower, financial resources, and material resources, after meeting the needs of certain key aspects, cannot equally meet the needs of other aspects. To solve this contradiction, we must adopt the principle of local service to the whole and first ensure the key points. We have formulated the 1959 industrial production and construction plan based on this principle, and we must also implement this plan based on this principle. All adjustments of production and basic construction tasks, the allocation and dispatch of important raw materials, materials, and equipment, the increase and allocation of enterprise employees, the change of labor and wage systems, and the arrangement of technical forces must be firmly grasped and unifiedly commanded by the central government and the provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional governments. For specific production and construction tasks, they should be arranged from top to bottom according to the situation of light and heavy, urgent and not urgent, and the possible supply of raw materials, materials, and equipment. For example, the most urgent task for the machinery industry at present is to quickly produce the mining equipment, coal washing equipment, coking equipment, rolling equipment, power station equipment, and irrigation equipment stipulated in the plan. The raw materials and materials unifiedly dispatched by the state should first ensure the need to produce these equipment. The machinery manufacturing departments, when specifically arranging the production tasks of these equipment, should also arrange the production of which equipment and which models first, to ensure the needs of key departments in production and construction in terms of time and variety.

To complete the huge tasks of industrial production and basic construction in 1959 on time, in quantity, and in quality, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership work and regularly conduct practical inspections of various links in production and construction. Important products and construction projects should arrange progress tables by week, month, or quarter, and the leading organs of the central government and the provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional governments should designate personnel to go deep into workshops or construction sites to inspect progress and quality, ensuring the accurate realization of plan indicators.

As proven by the experience of previous years, especially the experience of 1958, the most basic guarantee for completing the industrial plan is to implement the mass line method in work, to combine centralized leadership with the launch of a vigorous mass movement. All industrial enterprises must implement the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, and must seriously observe reasonable and necessary regulations and systems. The phenomenon of no one being responsible for production and construction and violating necessary regulations and systems is not allowed. However, the centralized leadership we need is centralized leadership based on democracy. Centralized leadership should not hinder the mobilization of the masses but should ensure the full mobilization of the masses. We should actively lead the masses of workers and staff to discuss the tasks stipulated in the national plan through workers' congresses and other meetings, using the method of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," to come up with ideas and methods, and strive to complete and over-fulfill the tasks. Important meetings of enterprises should widely absorb the cadres and active elements of grassroots units; all major decisions should seek their opinions. All methods that have been effective in developing mass movements in 1958, such as the Party committee secretary taking the lead, leading cadres managing "experimental fields," convening on-site meetings, conducting visits and evaluations, launching red flag competitions, the method of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management, the method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses, should be continued and further developed and improved.

The mass movement of small-scale enterprises and traditional production on the industrial front should continue to be developed and improved. This small-scale enterprise traditional production still undertakes important tasks in industrial production this year, for example, in mining, coal washing, coking, copper smelting, and the production of building materials; in iron smelting and steel smelting, after improving technology, it will still occupy a certain proportion. Some crude iron and crude steel products and other traditional production products, although their quality is not good and their cost is relatively high, are suitable for the needs of certain ranges in our country at present, especially the needs of vast rural areas. Therefore, we must not underestimate their role; otherwise, we will make mistakes. "Combining modern and traditional methods" is our long-term policy for developing industry. The combination of modern and traditional methods is a permanent thing, although the content and form of "modern" and "traditional" in the future will be different from now. Of course, regardless of the industry, small-scale enterprise traditional production should pay attention to improving technology, improving operating methods and labor organization, striving to improve labor productivity, improve product quality, and reduce product cost. Small-scale enterprises should gradually adopt some modern technologies and transform into so-called modern production. This is a necessary task. This task should be solved faster for those traditional productions that occupy more labor and raw materials.

As on the industrial front, on the fronts of agriculture, transportation, postal services, and commerce, to complete the 1959 plan, we must insist on the mass line work method and launch vigorous mass movements.

On the agricultural front, the broad masses of peasants have already done a lot of preparatory work for production in the autumn and winter of last year. However, to achieve the leap forward plan this year, we must continue to mobilize the masses and launch a mass movement for large-scale high yield. The cadres of communes and counties must go deep into the fields and unite with the community members, struggle for a great harvest in the summer and autumn of this year, struggle for the implementation of the ten proposals put forward at the National Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialism Construction in January this year, and struggle to complete and over-fulfill the production plans for grain, cotton, oil crops, hemp crops, sugar crops, various sideline products, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline industries, and fisheries this year.

The agricultural leap forward in 1958 provided rich experience in the eight technical measures for increasing production: soil, fertilizer, water, seed, density, protection, management, and tools. These experiences show us that different measures should be taken to adapt to different natural conditions and different crops, and not to be uniform; various measures are interrelated and interdependent, and one cannot be satisfied with only taking one or a few measures. We must summarize these experiences well, so that each commune and production team can, based on their specific conditions, determine various appropriate technical measures for increasing production and implement them seriously.

The continued leap forward in agriculture, before the realization of agricultural mechanization, requires a large amount of labor. The realization of the people's commune system and the establishment of public canteens and nurseries have liberated tens of thousands of women from household chores, but due to the great increase in production tasks, the labor force in rural areas is still insufficient. Under the current conditions, the labor force engaged in agriculture (including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline industries, and fisheries) in rural areas should generally not be less than 80%. To meet the needs of the labor force in rural areas, urban industrial and mining enterprises should stop recruiting workers from rural areas for a period of time and send back the surplus temporary workers recruited from rural areas. Counties and people's communes should establish industrial and mining enterprises and other basic construction projects generally in accordance with the agricultural season, more in the off-season and less in the busy season. The administrative management personnel and service personnel of communes should also be strictly streamlined, and those who can use semi-labor force and auxiliary labor force should use less or no strong labor force.

The fundamental way to solve the shortage of labor in rural areas is to improve the labor productivity of agriculture, to gradually realize technological innovation and technological revolution, and to gradually realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural tools. The agricultural tool reform movement launched in 1958 must continue, and the proven improved agricultural tools should be seriously promoted and popularized.

The consolidation of the people's commune is the premise for the smooth development of agricultural production. The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee made the broad cadres and masses correctly understand the socialist collective ownership nature of the people's commune in the current stage, understand that the people's commune must implement distribution according to labor, equal exchange, unified leadership, graded management, graded accounting, democratic management of the commune, and thrifty management of the commune, which has played a decisive role in the consolidation of the people's commune. After nearly three months of commune rectification work, the management system of the people's commune is gradually being improved, and the style of work of the cadres has also improved significantly. In the near future, all people's communes across the country should hold a community representatives' congress, summarize the commune rectification work, inspect and arrange production, sort out the commune accounts, discuss summer harvest distribution, and elect the commune management organization. We believe that after doing a good job in these rectification and construction work, the people's commune will be able to better mobilize the enthusiasm of all community members, people will have more enthusiasm, and the completion of the 1959 agricultural increase production task will be more guaranteed.

In transportation, especially in railway transportation, to achieve the 1959 plan, we must strive to strengthen transportation organization work, effectively tap the potential of various existing transportation equipment, and complete the basic construction tasks in a planned manner.

The transportation department should improve the planning of transportation work, strive to shorten the cargo handling time, accelerate the turnover of vehicles and ships, save fuel consumption, and complete more transportation tasks with the existing transportation equipment. For transportation tasks, they should be arranged appropriately according to the situation of light and heavy, urgent and not urgent, and first ensure the timely transportation of important production materials such as steel and iron, coal, and important living materials such as grain and sideline products. Special attention should be paid to the combination of long-distance transportation and short-distance transportation, and the combination of land transportation and water transportation. To strengthen short-distance transportation, we should vigorously organize the vehicles and ships of the people's communes in rural areas to make up for the shortage of modern transportation equipment. Various industrial departments and commercial departments should actively help the transportation department to reasonably organize transportation and reduce or eliminate unreasonable phenomena such as circular transportation, overlong transportation, and repeated transportation.

To ensure the necessary supply of materials and maintain the continued stability of the market, the commercial department has a heavy task in 1959. As mentioned earlier, the total retail sales of social commodities in 1959 will reach 650 billion yuan, an increase of 19% compared to 548 billion yuan in 1958; if compared to 170 billion yuan in the early days of the founding of the nation in 1950, it has increased by 2.8 times; if compared to 348 billion yuan in the first year of the First Five-Year Plan—1953, it has also increased by 87%. Due to the large population of our country, even if each person consumes a little more, it will add up to a very large number. Under the condition that the production of consumer goods cannot meet the needs, the phenomenon of temporary shortage of supply and demand of this kind of material or that kind of material is difficult to completely avoid. To make overall arrangements for the national market, to do a good job in the supply of consumer goods, and to prevent and reduce the phenomenon of supply and demand imbalance is an important task for the commercial department at present.

Various levels of commercial institutions should strive to strengthen the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and daily industrial goods, do a good job in the procurement of various "waste" materials as industrial raw materials, and promote the development of agricultural and sideline products production through the contract system of purchase and sale. At the same time, they should also strengthen the management of export trade, so that the state's export plan can be completed on time, in quantity, and in quality.

Whether on the industrial, agricultural, transportation, or commercial front, the central link of the mass movement should be to improve labor productivity, increase production, practice thrift, and oppose waste. The scale of the 1959 national economic plan is magnificent, and the task is arduous. However, it cannot be said that our potential has been exhausted, and the plan indicators can no longer be exceeded. In production and construction, the possibility of technological innovation and technological revolution is limitless. Improving tools, improving equipment, improving equipment utilization rate, improving product design and construction design, improving operating methods and construction methods, saving labor, raw materials, and materials, using various substitutes and various "waste" materials, improving product quality and project quality, reducing the rate of defective and substandard products, all of these can improve labor productivity and reduce costs. As long as we resolutely implement political command, improve the ideological awareness of cadres and masses, make everyone understand the great political significance of the 1959 plan and the current problems, and mobilize the masses, then we will definitely be able to find a thousand ways to increase production and practice thrift. For example, the national coal mines increased their average daily output from 9.6 million tons in January and February to 11.3 million tons in March after launching a competition movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution among the broad masses of workers and staff in early March, thereby over-fulfilling the first quarter plan task. Such mass movements are not only appearing in the coal industry but also in other industries, and in agriculture and transportation. Now is the beginning of the second quarter, which is a crucial time to complete the annual plan. We should mobilize the enthusiasm of every worker, peasant, intellectual, and every patriotic citizen in every corner of the country, from the ideological and political aspects, to immediately launch a nationwide movement of increasing production and practicing thrift. We believe that as long as everyone can seriously launch this movement and persist to the end, our 1959 national economic plan will definitely be completed, and it will be over-fulfilled!

3. Our Tasks on the Cultural and Educational Front

With the arrival of the socialist economic upsurge, a socialist cultural upsurge has begun to rise in our country. After the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the leading position of the proletariat has been established and strengthened in various departments and units of cultural and educational undertakings, ensuring the political guarantee for the rise of culture and education. In 1958, not only did various cultural and educational undertakings established by the state develop rapidly, but the broad masses of workers and peasants, feeling the urgent need to grasp culture, also used their own strength to establish schools, conduct scientific research, engage in cultural activities, and create a situation of a broad mass cultural revolution. The intellectuals on the cultural and educational front, in the process of self-reform, have generally improved their socialist enthusiasm, strengthened their connection with the workers and peasants and production labor, and actively played a role in the popularization and improvement of culture. Continuing to mobilize all positive factors on the cultural and educational front, advancing the cause of cultural revolution, popularizing socialist culture, and continuously consolidating and improving work on the basis of popularization, so that the development of cultural and educational work can meet the needs of the entire socialist construction, this is our task.

In the past few years, especially in 1958, our country's educational undertakings have developed greatly. The number of students in our country's institutions of higher learning was 190,000 in 1952, reaching 440,000 in 1957, an increase of more than 100%; in 1958, it increased by 50% compared to 1957, reaching 660,000. The number of students in secondary schools was more than 3 million in 1952, reaching more than 7 million in 1957, also an increase of more than 100%, and in 1958, it increased by 70% compared to 1957, reaching 12 million. The number of primary school students was 51.1 million in 1952, reaching 64.4 million in 1957, an increase of 26%, and in 1958, it increased by 34% compared to 1957, reaching 86 million. The cultural, technical, and political education of workers and peasants in 1958 adopted various forms and developed greatly. The work of eliminating illiteracy also made great progress.

The achievements of educational undertakings are not only reflected in the development of quantity. More importantly, under the condition that the Party's leadership of educational work has been greatly strengthened, we have implemented the policy of serving the politics of the working class, combining education with productive labor, and combining education with production, thereby launching a great and profound revolution in educational undertakings.

Title: For the Political Service of the Working Class, For the Cause of Socialism
Author:

Page: 1

Serving the political needs of the working class and the cause of socialism is the fundamental starting point of our educational endeavors. In our schools, we must seriously conduct socialist and communist ideological and political education to raise students' socialist consciousness. We must ensure that our children and youth systematically and step-by-step master cultural knowledge and modern scientific achievements, and in the process of learning, cultivate the habit of engaging in productive labor, so that they can engage in both mental and physical labor. Those who hold the educational views of the exploiting classes of the old society will naturally oppose our policy. In fact, the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes all conduct ideological and political education in their schools to maintain their class interests. The bourgeois society only provides workers with some shallow and narrow knowledge, and in ideological and political terms, it strives to deceive, numb, and corrupt them. The bourgeoisie has consistently used the spirit of separating theory from practice and mental labor from physical labor to cultivate intellectuals who serve the exploitative system. Our educational policy is fundamentally opposed to this bourgeois policy. Our policy is to arm workers, peasants, and intellectuals with the scientific, revolutionary worldview of the proletariat, to eliminate all influences of the exploiting classes' ideology; to make education serve the laboring people, to make culture mastered by the laboring people, and to combine mental labor with physical labor.

In our schools, we have already begun to formally include productive labor in the educational curriculum, organizing students to participate in a certain amount of productive labor according to different situations. Through the practice of productive labor, the vast number of teachers and students have gained more practical production knowledge and fostered a spirit of loving labor and respecting laborers. In higher education institutions, productive practice has also strongly promoted scientific research work. It has been proven that the correct combination of education and productive labor can help strengthen the connection between schools and society, help combine theory with practice, and help gradually combine mental labor with physical labor, making schools increasingly develop into new-type schools that cultivate communist new people. Of course, for such a thorough revolution in the educational sector, we currently only have initial experience, and there are still shortcomings in our work, as well as some problems that need further research and resolution. We should continue to accumulate and summarize experience, continuously improve our work, and better implement the policy of combining education with productive labor.

The development of our country's educational sector must adopt a method that combines popularization with improvement. To achieve the popularization of culture and to meet the urgent needs of the current national construction, in addition to various levels of full-time regular schools, we should, based on actual possibilities, continue to develop half-day schools, rural, and factory and mine evening schools. Mass literacy campaigns should be actively promoted. At the same time, we must pay special attention to improving the teaching quality of various schools. Last year, various levels of schools all developed significantly, and now we need to carry out consolidation, improvement, and enhancement work on this large development foundation. In various levels of full-time regular schools, improving teaching quality should be a constant basic task, and we should first concentrate our efforts to develop a batch of key schools to cultivate higher-quality specialized talents for the country, rapidly promoting the improvement of our country's scientific and cultural level.

The patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests and major diseases, and the sports movement aimed at enhancing the physical fitness of the people, achieved significant results in 1958 and must continue to be promoted. In health work, we should continue to implement the mass line, combining experts with the masses to quickly and effectively improve the health conditions of our people. We should unite traditional and Western medicine, organizing them to jointly serve the people's health cause, jointly develop our country's medical heritage, and develop medical science. In sports work, we should implement the policy of combining popularization with improvement, widely promote mass sports activities, and gradually improve our country's sports level.

In 1958, in the field of scientific and technological work, a mass movement of thousands and tens of thousands of people advancing towards science began, achieving results in various aspects; the scientific and technological workforce also developed significantly. Many scientific researchers and engineering and technical personnel in scientific research institutions, higher education institutions, and industrial and agricultural production fronts have shown very high enthusiasm in serving the cause of socialist construction.

In science and technology, we are still backward and must strive harder. The task of directly serving production and construction should be given top priority. On the various fronts of production and construction, there are countless technical issues, and scientific and technological workers should divide labor and cooperate to work hard to solve these issues. Advanced science and technology must also be developed; for those conditions that are not yet in place, we should currently prepare conditions from all aspects. Basic theoretical research has a profound impact on the development of science and technology and must be given sufficient attention.

Theoretical research in the social sciences should also be actively developed and strengthened. Ignoring its importance is not allowed. We should encourage social science theorists to conduct systematic, long-term efforts under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, fully grasp relevant materials, and engage in independent, creative research. In the literary and artistic front, whether it is the work of professional writers and artists or the amateur literary and artistic activities of workers and peasants, a vibrant scene has emerged. We should encourage professional writers and artists to, through hard work, educate the people with works of higher ideological and artistic quality, and meet the cultural life needs of the people. At the same time, we should actively lead the people's literary and artistic activities, pay attention to cultivating literary and artistic talents emerging from the working people.

To ensure the healthy development of science and art, we should, on the basis of serving socialism, implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." This policy points out the path for the prosperity and development of our country's science and culture, giving great encouragement to the entire scientific and cultural community. After the Party proposed this policy in 1956, right-wing elements soon distorted this policy, posing as socialist "fragrant flowers" to attack the Party and socialism, attempting to seize the leadership of the cultural sector. The victory of the anti-rightist struggle shattered their reactionary plots. This created favorable conditions for implementing this policy. The leap forward in socialist construction and the high tide of the cultural revolution among the masses have opened up a broad horizon for the "hundred flowers blooming and a hundred schools of thought contending" in science and art. We believe that through free debates among different schools of thought in science and free competitions among different forms and styles in art, it will not take long for our scientific and cultural undertakings to enter a prosperous era and achieve great achievements. (Applause)

Building a team of millions of working-class intellectuals is a great historical task on the cultural front. This team will be formed by cultivating new intellectuals and transforming old intellectuals.

The work of self-transformation by old intellectuals has recently shown a gratifying phenomenon: many among them not only sincerely accept the Party's leadership and serve the construction of socialism but have also begun to go deep into the masses, regularly go to factories and villages, participate in labor, and gained new experiences of living and working with the laboring people, raising their ideological awareness. Some bourgeois intellectuals, after long-term and serious self-transformation, have begun to transform into working-class intellectuals, and some advanced elements among them have successively joined the Communist Party of China. These facts all prove that the Party and the state's consistent policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals is completely correct. Old intellectuals, standing politically on the side of socialism and working with the broad masses, can use the knowledge and technology they master to play their roles in the socialist cause and be welcomed by the people. Of course, they need a relatively long period to thoroughly break with the bourgeois worldview and truly master the proletarian worldview. It is wrong to think that old intellectuals no longer need to undergo self-transformation or that they must complete a thorough transformation in a very short time, otherwise, they cannot work. All old intellectuals who are willing to walk the socialist path should continue to strive to gradually achieve self-transformation in the long-term work practice ahead. We should properly arrange their work, value their enthusiasm in work, and help them achieve more results in work. At the same time, we should help them study Marxism-Leninism, help them have more opportunities to get close to the masses, understand the actual situation, and, based on voluntariness, appropriately participate in physical labor.

A large number of young intellectuals are growing like bamboo shoots after a rain. They are bravely advancing towards being both red and expert and have already made initial contributions in various aspects of work. We should guide them to achieve greater results, encourage them to continuously climb the peaks of scientific knowledge, and educate them not to be arrogant at any time. Young intellectuals also have the task of constantly undergoing self-transformation. No matter what position they are in, they should, while striving to improve their professional level, seriously study Marxism-Leninism, participate in the masses' production and struggle practice, participate in physical labor, and strictly demand themselves in politics, ideology, and work. Young intellectuals should humbly learn from learned elders, and older intellectuals should also learn from the strengths of young intellectuals. All patriotic intellectuals should unite under the banner of socialism and work together to build a great motherland. (Applause)

IV. On the Political Life of the State

The people's democratic dictatorship and the unity within the people in our country, after achieving decisive victories on various fronts of the socialist revolution, have been more consolidated than ever before. (Applause) This is because, first, in the industrial and commercial sector, we have basically replaced the capitalist ownership of the means of production with state ownership of the means of production, while paying capitalists a fixed interest, thus basically resolving the economic contradictions between the laboring people and the industrial and commercial bourgeoisie; second, in the agricultural and handicraft sectors, we have replaced individual ownership of the means of production by peasants and handicraftsmen with collective ownership of the means of production, thus resolving the contradictions within the peasantry and handicraftsmen caused by individual ownership, as well as the contradictions between individual economies and socialist planned economies; third, on the ideological and political fronts, we have launched a struggle against the right-wing elements of the bourgeoisie, smashing their anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist attacks, raising the socialist consciousness of the people of various strata, and isolating the right-wing elements among the people; fourth, we have conducted rectification movements among the people, especially among the advanced elements of the people, carrying out debates and education on the two-line struggle, and struggles against bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism, greatly strengthening the connection between cadres and the masses.

Our country has basically eliminated the remaining counter-revolutionaries, and social order is more secure; however, there are still a few counter-revolutionaries who must be continued to be eliminated. For the counter-revolutionaries who have been apprehended, we will continue to implement the policy of combining punishment with leniency that has been effective in the past few years. For the right-wing elements of the bourgeoisie, we have adopted a lenient treatment method to help them undergo transformation, not depriving them of their civil rights, and appropriately arranging their work and living conditions to gradually transform as many people as possible into new people.

Now, American imperialism in the Western Pacific has occupied many places and is threatening us at any time. Therefore, we must continue to consolidate national defense and strengthen national defense construction to safeguard the peaceful construction of our people. (Applause)

In the people of our country, as mentioned above, due to the victory of the socialist revolution, especially the deepening of the rectification movement, and the gradual implementation of the correct handling of contradictions among the people proposed by Chairman Mao, people's democracy has achieved significant development. In the future, we should solidify the good practices of the rectification movement in our political life, consult with the masses on matters, fully discuss different opinions. We should regularly convene cadre meetings, mass meetings, post big-character posters, adhere to the principle of "speakers are not guilty, listeners take heed," allowing people to speak freely, not fearing "singing counter-songs," because only when contradictions are fully exposed can problems be more quickly and appropriately resolved. Whether in rural or urban areas, we must utilize the forms of three-level, four-level, five-level, or six-level cadre meetings, utilize cadre meetings with the participation of grassroots cadres and advanced and non-advanced elements among the masses, allowing the policies of the Party and the state and the decisions of higher authorities to directly face grassroots cadres and the masses, and allowing the opinions of the masses and grassroots cadres to directly face higher authorities. Experience has proven that such meetings are most convenient for concentrating the wisdom of the masses and strengthening unity among the people, and are an effective weapon for promoting people's democracy.

In the past year, state workers have made significant progress in deepening their connection with the masses. A large number of cadres have corrected their varying degrees of detachment from the masses' ideology and style, overcome the bureaucratic, stagnant, arrogant, and pampered attitudes inherited from the old society, and appeared among the masses in the guise of ordinary laborers. More than a million cadres in national organs at the county level and above have been sent to rural areas, factories, and mines to participate in physical labor and grassroots work. At the same time, rural work leading cadres regularly become members of communes, factory leading cadres regularly become workers in workshops, military commanders regularly become soldiers in platoons, and all leading cadres with physical conditions regularly participate in physical labor, forming a new trend. This is a revolutionary, communist trend. This not only opens up a new path for the combination of cadres and the masses but also opens up a new path for the combination of mental and physical labor. In 1959, national organs at all levels should, based on the experience of 1958, continue to organize cadres to systematically and regularly go down to the grassroots and participate in physical labor.

The foundation of the great unity of the Chinese people is the alliance between workers and peasants. Through the people's commune movement and the leap forward of the entire socialist cause, this alliance has become increasingly consolidated. There are still some strata that do not belong to workers and peasants. On the premise of further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, during the period of socialist construction, we will continue to maintain the alliance between the laboring people and the non-laboring people who can cooperate.

After the struggle against the right-wing elements, various democratic parties and members of the national bourgeoisie have also conducted more in-depth rectification movements. Many among them have made varying degrees of progress through study, work, and labor training. Many members of democratic parties and other democratic personages participating in state work, except for a small group of right-wing elements, have generally fulfilled their duties at their respective posts. Various democratic parties have rectified their organizations during the rectification; they continue to play an active role in uniting different social forces to serve the cause of socialism. In the future, in our country, we will continue to consolidate and develop the united front of people's democracy on the basis of serving socialism. Under the premise of acknowledging the leadership of the Communist Party, the Communist Party and various democratic parties will coexist for a long time, mutually supervise each other, which is beneficial to the people's cause. For capitalists, the state will pay them fixed interest according to the original agreed period and will actively help them undergo self-education and self-transformation while participating in the construction of socialism.

In the work of ethnic minorities, in the past four years, the government, based on the provisions of the Constitution, has continued to implement regional autonomy for ethnic minorities under the principle of ensuring national unity and achieving ethnic equality, achieving significant results. In addition to the existing Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have been successively established, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has also been established. In addition, 29 autonomous prefectures and 54 autonomous counties have been established in Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces and autonomous regions. These ethnic autonomous areas include more than 30 ethnic groups.

In the ethnic minority areas, except for Tibet and a few other places, democratic reforms have been completed, and socialist transformation has been basically completed, and people's communes have been established on this basis. Many ethnic minorities, who were previously oppressed by feudal systems and even slave systems, have now embarked on the bright path of socialism. They are truly developing at a rapid pace. (Prolonged applause)

In 1958, the economy and culture of ethnic minorities also made great leaps forward. According to statistics, the four autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Ningxia increased their total industrial output value by 88% in 1958 compared to 1957, and their grain production also increased by 83%. The number of ethnic minority students in the country is growing rapidly. In the first half of 1958, there were 3,190,000 primary school students, 310,000 middle school students, and 16,000 higher education students. Among the 36 million ethnic minority population in the country, the total number of students has reached 3,510,000. Compared to before liberation, the number of primary school students has increased by more than six times, the number of middle school students has increased by 79 times, and the number of higher education students has increased by 27 times. Many ethnic minorities that previously had no written language have now formulated writing schemes and have books and newspapers published in their own languages.

Due to the correct implementation of ethnic policies, the friendship and unity between the Han people and various ethnic minorities and among various ethnic minorities have been greatly strengthened. (Applause) In the Han cadres, the struggle against the tendency of Han chauvinism has been carried out for many years. In many ethnic minority areas, during the rectification movement, struggles against various forms and degrees of local nationalism have also been carried out. The broad ethnic minority cadres and masses, through the tempering of the rectification movement and the practice of economic and cultural construction, are continuously raising their awareness, and a large number of advanced elements are emerging among them. This is a reliable force for the further rapid development of the socialist cause in ethnic minority areas. (Applause)

The unity of the motherland is the highest interest of all ethnic groups in the country. China, as a unified, multi-ethnic country, is the result of long-term historical development. After imperialists began to invade China, they have consistently attempted to disintegrate China's unity and destroy the unity of the Chinese ethnic groups, but they have not achieved this goal. The imperialist invasion has instead made the vast majority of the Chinese people deeply aware of their common fate and the value of a unified country. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have brought the ethnic groups within the country even closer together. The patriotic people of various ethnic groups, from the lessons of historical facts, have realized that only in a unified family of the motherland, which has completely rid itself of imperialist oppression and embarked on the socialist path, can ethnic groups thrive. They have realized that the people's democratic state led by the Communist Party has fundamentally eliminated ethnic oppression and is striving to eliminate the residual psychological remnants of ethnic discrimination left over from history. Under the capitalist system, more developed and powerful ethnic groups always strive to keep other ethnic groups in a backward state to oppress and exploit them. Under the socialist system, the situation is the opposite. In our country, ethnic groups are not only politically equal but also in economic, political, and cultural aspects, the more advanced ethnic groups that are in the majority have the responsibility to help the more backward ethnic groups that are in the minority, so that everyone can progress together and develop together. (Applause)

Recently, the armed rebellion launched by the original local government of Tibet and the upper-class reactionary clique to betray the motherland and disrupt unity has suffered a humiliating failure. The government has ordered the dissolution of the original local government of Tibet (i.e., the Kashag) and the exercise of local government powers by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, so that Tibet can quickly achieve ethnic regional autonomy and gradually carry out democratic reforms. This measure has been warmly welcomed by the broad patriotic Tibetan monks and laypeople. This is a great victory for China's policy of ethnic unity. (Prolonged applause)

The Central People's Government has always had a clear policy towards the local government of Tibet. We have consistently advocated the unity of all ethnic groups within the country and the unity of the Tibetan people themselves, advocating the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy in Tibet. The Central People's Government has consistently implemented a policy of freedom of religious belief and has taken various active measures to assist the economic and cultural development of the local government of Tibet. All of this has been warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people. According to the 17-point agreement for the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, the local government of Tibet should unite the people and expel imperialist invaders from Tibet; the backward social system of Tibet must be reformed. Considering the ideological situation of the upper-class people in Tibet, we have allowed the reform in Tibet to be slower, giving the original local government of Tibet and the upper-class people enough time to consider. However, the original local government of Tibet and the upper-class reactionary clique have continued to collude with imperialists, the Kuomintang bandits, and foreign reactionaries, attempting to rely on their strength to split the motherland, restore imperialist influence in Tibet, and preserve Tibet's backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system. They have never intended to implement democratic local autonomy with the participation of the people and have consistently obstructed the progress of the preparatory work for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Their actions seriously violate the interests of the Tibetan people and the common interests of all ethnic groups within the country. Therefore, their rebellious actions have immediately been met with the resolute opposition of all ethnic groups in the country and, first of all, the resolute opposition of the broad Tibetan people, including many patriotic and progressive upper-class elements. (Applause) These reactionaries have completely misjudged the situation; they do not know that the era of imperialists interfering in China's internal affairs has long passed. (Prolonged applause)

Now, the situation in Tibet is completely under the control of the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. The troops of the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region, with the active support of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, are continuing to sweep away the remaining rebel elements hiding in remote areas. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has begun to exercise local government powers. Regarding the future social reforms in Tibet, the Central Government will conduct thorough consultations with the upper, middle, and lower-level patriotic personages in Tibet and various strata of the people to decide on the timing, steps, and methods of implementing the reforms. In any case, the reforms will be gradually carried out under the condition of fully considering the characteristics of Tibet, and during the reform process, the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people will be fully respected, and the excellent culture of the Tibetans will be respected and promoted. Although the Dalai Lama has been abducted to India, we still hope that he can break free from the control of the rebel elements and return to the motherland. (Applause)

Tibetan reactionaries often put on a pious appearance, saying that they hope people will ascend to heaven, but they themselves have turned Tibet into a hell on earth and want the Tibetan people to live in a life without sunlight, trapped in a darkness more barbaric and cruel than medieval Europe. They also often put on a peaceful appearance, but they actually incite bandits to burn, kill, and loot, harming the people, and in the end, they themselves dared to launch a crazy armed rebellion, thus walking the path of self-destruction. Tibet, including the three regions of Changdu, U-Tsang, and Dbus-gtsang, has a population of 1.2 million, and only about 20,000 people participated in the rebellion, most of whom were deceived and coerced into participating, and also included a portion of rebel elements who fled from the original Xikang Province east of the Jinsha River, known as the Khamba people. Among the Tibetan people who demand reforms and the upper-class progressive elements who support reforms, as well as the middle elements who can be persuaded, there are more than 110,000 people. Now, some people in the world, who claim to sympathize with the Tibetan people, have not distinguished which part of the people they sympathize with. Is it the sympathy for the more than 110,000 laboring people, progressive elements, and middle elements who demand and support reforms, or is it the sympathy for the extremely small number of reactionary elements? We hope that all well-intentioned friends (the well-intentioned friends here refer to those who are willing to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with our country and declare non-interference in China's internal affairs), (the entire venue is lively) will first clarify this obvious distinction between the vast majority and the extremely small minority. If people understand the real situation within Tibet, they should sympathize with the vast majority of Tibetan laboring people who are oppressed by the old system and sympathize with their demand for social reform. Due to the failure of the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionaries, the Tibetan people now have the opportunity to break free from the shackles of the serf system and realize their aspirations for democratic autonomy and social progress. They will, with the help of all ethnic groups in the country, gradually turn the Tibetan plateau into a true paradise on earth. This is a matter of great joy for the Tibetan people, all ethnic groups in the country, and all true sympathizers of the Tibetan people in the world. (Applause)

Tibet is Chinese territory, and the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionaries and the suppression of this rebellion are China's internal affairs, even the imperialists who attempt to invade Tibet cannot deny this. After the Tibetan rebellion event and after the Dalai Lama was abducted to Indian territory by the rebel elements, our great friendly neighbor India, Prime Minister Nehru, issued consecutive statements on non-interference in China's internal affairs and the continued consolidation of Sino-Indian friendship, and we welcome this. (Applause) China and India have a history of more than two thousand years of friendship, and both are countries that first advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and we have no reason to shake our friendship and the diplomatic principles jointly adhered to by the two countries because of a small group of Tibetan rebels. Indeed, before the failure of the Tibetan rebellion, the Tibetan reactionaries and some foreign reactionaries had used certain border areas of China and India to carry out activities that disrupted China's unity and Sino-Indian friendship. However, the plans of these reactionaries have now failed. We hope that with the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, through the joint efforts of China and India, the friendly relations between the two great peaceful countries in Asia, each with a population of over a billion, will have a more solid foundation and better development. Those who maliciously attempt to sabotage Sino-Indian friendship will only be in vain. (Prolonged applause)

V. On Foreign Policy

While achieving great victories on various fronts at home, we have also made important progress in our foreign relations. Our country, together with the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples, has made tremendous efforts for the cause of safeguarding world peace. In the past four years, the number of countries that have established diplomatic relations and semi-diplomatic relations with our country has increased from 20 to 33; the number of countries and regions that have established economic relations with our country has reached 93; the number of countries and regions that have established cultural ties and conducted friendly exchanges with our country has reached 104. The attempt of American imperialism to isolate and exclude New China in international affairs has been failing day by day. (Prolonged applause)

The general characteristics of the current international situation are that the forces of socialism, the forces of national independence movements, and other peace-loving forces are rapidly developing, while the aggressive and war policies of imperialism are encountering numerous difficulties. As Chairman Mao said, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. (Stormy applause)

The socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is rapidly advancing. The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have achieved great successes in developing the national economy, improving people's welfare, strengthening the power of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, and maintaining world peace. After launching the world's first artificial Earth satellite, the Soviet Union has launched the world's first artificial planet. Not long ago, the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted a grand seven-year plan for the development of the national economy. This plan marks that the Soviet Union has entered an important historical period—the period of fully developing the construction of communist society, and it heralds the imminent arrival of the infinitely beautiful communist society to all humanity. (Prolonged applause) Other socialist countries are also rapidly developing their national economies. The entire socialist camp is now in the midst of an economic construction high tide. It can be confidently said that in a not very long historical period, the Soviet Union will surpass the United States in terms of per capita production, China will become an advanced industrial power, and the entire socialist camp will significantly surpass the imperialist camp in material production, thereby ensuring world peace. (Prolonged applause) The unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union has been further strengthened. (Applause)

Consolidating unity with the Soviet Union and consolidating unity with all socialist countries is our fundamental policy. In recent years, our country's friendly and mutually supportive brotherly relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have developed significantly. We have worked together closely in maintaining world peace, promoting human progress, and other common causes. In the past year and a half, our country has signed three agreements with the Soviet Union on Soviet assistance to our country in major scientific and technological research, assistance to our country in building 47 enterprises, and assistance to our country in building 78 enterprises, as well as a trade and navigation treaty. Our country has also signed a series of agreements with Albania, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Bulgaria to develop friendly cooperation and strengthen economic, trade, and cultural ties. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have provided tremendous assistance to our country's socialist economic and cultural construction. Here, on behalf of the government and people of our country, I express deep gratitude to the governments and peoples of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. (Applause) Based on our personal experience, we deeply feel that the mutual support and cooperation among socialist countries are important conditions for the smooth development of socialist countries. In the future, we will continue to actively strengthen our country's cooperation with the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries in politics, economy, technology, culture, and other aspects, and continue to strengthen the education of proletarian internationalism among the people.

Imperialists and reactionaries in various countries have always feared the unity of the peoples of various countries, especially the unity of the peoples of socialist countries. Recently, they have come up with various despicable ideas, attempting to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union, the two largest socialist countries. They hate the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries because this friendly unity is a strong bastion for safeguarding the cause of human peace and progress, which is beneficial to the peoples of the world and beneficial to world peace, but only detrimental to the imperialist aggressors and reactionaries in various countries. However, the iron fortress of friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union and all socialist countries is built on the basis of common interests and common ideals, and it is unbreakable, and it will never be broken. (Applause) The more the enemy wants to destroy it, the more the peoples of the world will realize that it is the reliance for the bright future of humanity, and the more the peoples of the world will unite around this fortress. (Applause)

Socialist countries have always consistently supported the efforts of all peoples and all peace-loving countries in the world to maintain peace, supported the struggles of all oppressed nations against aggression and colonialism, and supported the cause of maintaining national interests and developing national economies of newly independent countries. It is clear that the more the forces of aggression are suppressed, the more the cause of peace will be guaranteed. (Applause)

In recent years, the national independence movement has been surging, and the imperialist colonial system is continuing to disintegrate. Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which were once the rear bases of imperialism, have now become the front lines of anti-aggression and anti-colonialism. The spokesperson of the U.S. government also admits that the pillar of modern colonialism, American imperialism, is now in a "real whirlwind." Just as imperialism's aggression against Egypt and its threat to Syria in the past met with humiliating failure, in 1958, imperialism's subversive activities against Indonesia, and its armed invasions of Lebanon and Jordan also suffered serious setbacks. The national revolutionary movement in Iraq broke through the heavy oppression of imperialism and domestic reactionaries, achieving a brilliant victory. The long-suffering peoples of Africa, who have been enslaved and plundered by imperialism, are rapidly awakening. Many new independent countries have emerged on the African continent. The brave fighting Algerian people have established their own government. The struggles of the oppressed peoples in the Congo, Cameroon, Nyasaland, and other regions of Africa for freedom and independence are flourishing. The day when the peoples of Africa will once again become the masters of the African continent is approaching. (Applause) In Latin America, the national independence movement is combined with the struggle for democracy and against dictatorship. After a long period of armed struggle, the Cuban people finally overthrew the dictatorial regime of Batista, which was supported by American imperialism. This is a sign of the new surge in the national democratic movement in Latin America. (Applause)

Imperialist colonial forces will not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history, and the struggle for and maintenance of national independence will not be smooth. Imperialist colonial forces strive to maintain or restore their control over newly independent countries. In addition to directly carrying out military threats and armed suppression, they are also forming military alliances, signing military treaties, establishing military bases, intensifying economic aggression, instigating military coups, and organizing subversive activities. It is particularly noteworthy that imperialism is now using all means to disrupt the internal unity of these countries, disrupt the unity among these countries, and disrupt the unity between these countries and socialist countries, in order to achieve the goal of "divide and rule." Therefore, all countries struggling for and maintaining national independence, in order to achieve complete victory, not only need to defeat the armed intervention and aggression of imperialism but also need to break the various tricks and schemes of imperialism. (Applause)

The Chinese people have always sympathized with all anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, anti-aggression, and anti-intervention struggles in the world because our country was once a semi-colonial country that suffered greatly from imperialist aggression, and now the forces of imperialism are still occupying our territory of Taiwan. We are willing to provide support and assistance within our capabilities to all national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the recent anti-imperialist struggles of the Arab nations, we have always stood on the side of the peoples of the Arab countries. Recently, the Arab national independence movement has encountered some complex situations. Some figures in power in the United Arab Republic launched attacks on the Iraqi Republic and then launched attacks on the great friend of the Arab peoples, the Soviet Union. It is clear that such actions are not conducive to the cause of Arab national independence and will not gain the sympathy of the Arab peoples. We, like all friends of the Arab nations, hope that the difficulties encountered by the Arab national independence cause can find a way to overcome, so that the malicious plots of imperialists to harm the Arab nations will not succeed. (Applause)

Our country has developed good diplomatic relations with a series of newly independent countries in Asia and Africa. India, Indonesia, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Nepal, Afghanistan, some Arab countries, and African countries all pursue a policy of peace and neutrality in international affairs. They oppose war, reject being dragged into aggressive military alliances. In the common struggle against the aggressive and war policies of imperialism, in the common efforts to maintain the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, our country has widely established friendship with these countries. We cherish this friendship and are very grateful to many friendly countries for their support in international affairs. (Applause) Since 1958, our country has signed agreements with Yemen, Burma, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, and other countries to strengthen economic and trade ties and cultural cooperation, and has also expanded friendly exchanges with other Asian and African countries. Many countries in Southeast Asia are either bordering or near our country, and our country has common interests with these countries and no disputes that cannot be resolved peacefully, so we can and have formed a peaceful region in Asia. We hope that this peaceful region will continue to exist and expand to the entire Asia. (Applause)

American imperialism, in order to sow discord between many Southeast Asian countries and our country, to cover up its own aggression against these countries, deliberately spreads rumors that our country will be a "terrible threat" to the neighboring countries of Southeast Asia. The Yugoslav revisionist clique, which has betrayed the unity of socialist countries, after failing in their attempts to sow discord, is now trying to sabotage the friendly relations between Asian and African countries and our country and other socialist countries. However, all these attempts to sow discord are doomed to fail. (Applause) People know that our country has never invaded the territory of any neighboring country, has never interfered in the internal affairs of any neighboring country, and will always be so in the future. Even in the situation where the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits who fled to Burma have been harassing our border for a decade, threatening our security, our country has only strictly guarded the border and patiently waited for our friendly neighbor, the Burmese government, to handle it. The unresolved border issues between our country and some Southeast Asian neighbors and the nationality issues of overseas Chinese have been used by provocateurs as propaganda materials. However, people know that the unresolved borders between our country and some neighbors are the result of many historical reasons, primarily the long-term aggression of imperialism. Our country has always advocated resolving this issue through peaceful negotiations based on the Five Principles with the relevant countries. Before this issue is resolved, we believe that maintaining the status quo and not allowing the imperialist provocations to succeed is in the interest of both sides. As for the issue of overseas Chinese, the government of our country has always advised overseas Chinese to respect the laws and customs of the countries they reside in, not to participate in local political activities, and to strive to help the local people develop the economy. For the nationality of overseas Chinese choosing the nationality of the country they reside in based on the principle of voluntariness, our government also adopts a supportive attitude. Some Southeast Asian countries have adopted erroneous policies of expelling Chinese, which is completely a result of falling for the imperialist propaganda and provocation. We hope that this phenomenon can be corrected, and the legitimate interests of overseas Chinese can be protected. In addition, imperialism has also widely propagated the so-called "dumping" and "economic expansion" of our country in Southeast Asia. However, everyone knows that socialist countries do not need to carry out any "economic expansion" or "dumping." The domestic market of our country is very broad, and our imports and exports to capitalist countries account for only one-thousandth of the total imports and exports of the capitalist world, and our exports to Southeast Asian countries account for only one percent of their imports, so there is no question of "dumping" or "seizing foreign markets." Of course, there is the possibility of developing economic cooperation between our country and these countries on the principles of voluntariness, equality, and mutual benefit. In the future, we will continue to develop this mutually beneficial cooperation.

Imperialists are always busy interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, busy trying to put the entire globe, even the moon, under their military control, (laughter) but they cannot manage their own affairs. (laughter) Imperialist countries are being hit by economic crises. Their conflicts with each other are surfacing. Although imperialist countries are still looking for some compromises to temporarily ease their contradictions, their contradictions are irreconcilable, and the law of uneven development of capitalism makes these contradictions increasingly sharpened, and their trend of splitting up is inevitable. A gloomy and chaotic scene is shrouding the entire imperialist camp, and the Western bourgeoisie has lost confidence in tomorrow. (Applause)

Socialist countries have always advocated coexistence and peaceful competition with capitalist countries. In the past four years, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries have made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and safeguard the peace and security of the peoples of all countries. They have proposed major peace initiatives such as disarmament, banning the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs, holding a summit meeting of the governments of Eastern and Western countries, establishing nuclear-free zones and collective security systems in Europe and Asia and the Pacific, and these peace initiatives and efforts have inspired all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, becoming a decisive factor in promoting the easing of the international situation. However, the imperialist war bloc has always opposed these peace initiatives, attempting to use a new war to reverse the wheel of historical development. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are still active, and the United States is continuing to expand its global military base network, continuing to produce atomic and hydrogen bombs, and using these weapons to arm the militaries of a series of countries.

The danger of war still exists seriously, and all peace-loving forces in the world must continue to be vigilant in safeguarding peace and opposing war. Even within the imperialist camp, those with clearer minds have begun to realize that under the conditions of the unprecedented strength of the socialist camp and the resolute opposition of the broad masses of the peoples of various countries to war, launching a new world war will not bring a favorable outcome to imperialism, but will only accelerate the complete collapse of imperialism and the victory of socialism in the world. (Applause)

American imperialism is particularly committed to reviving German and Japanese militarism, hoping to use these two old war bases in Europe and Asia to exacerbate international tensions. This cannot but attract the serious attention of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world.

American imperialism, in the long period after the war, has consistently pursued a policy of dividing Germany and reviving West German militarism. To eliminate the threat to European and world peace, to promote the direct negotiations between the two Germanys to solve the national task of uniting the German people's homeland, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have put forward a series of reasonable proposals and made unremitting efforts. Not long ago, the Soviet government again put forward proposals to end the occupation system of West Berlin and make West Berlin a free city, as well as proposals for the relevant countries to convene a conference to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany. Our government supports these proposals of the Soviet government. Due to the consistent efforts of the Soviet government and the strong demands of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, the United States, Britain, and France have been forced to agree to the Soviet proposal to convene a foreign ministers' meeting and a summit meeting. We hope that these meetings will help resolve the mature international issues, first of all, the issue of the German peace treaty and the Berlin issue, thereby opening the way to easing international tensions.

In the East, American imperialism has consistently supported the revival of Japanese militarism. The Japanese monopoly capitalist group also hopes to realize its potential imperialist ambitions by relying on the United States. Recently, the Kishi government has actively prepared to revise the Japan-U.S. "security treaty," engage in new military collusion with the United States, and attempt to equip the Japanese military with nuclear weapons. This poses a serious threat to the security of Asian countries, especially our country. The Chinese people have always supported the Japanese people's desire to break free from American control, adopt a policy of peace and neutrality, and make Japan an independent, peaceful, and democratic country.

To promote the normalization of relations between China and Japan, our government has not held past grievances and has treated the vast majority of war criminals of the Japanese invasion of China with leniency, and has also actively assisted in the repatriation of Japanese residents, the development of trade between the two countries, and the friendly exchanges between the two peoples. The fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement was signed on March 5, 1958, under the assistance of our government, breaking through various obstacles. However, the Kishi government refused to give the necessary guarantees, making the agreement unenforceable. In May 1958, under the encouragement of the Kishi government, the incident of insulting our national flag occurred in Nagasaki. In October 1958, after our People's Liberation Army shelled Jinmen, Kishi himself publicly slandered our country as "aggressors," ranting that we cannot allow the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. Thus, Sino-Japanese relations have fallen into a state of almost complete interruption. The reactionary policies of the Kishi government have aroused great anger among the Japanese people. The Kishi government, although it has to express a willingness to resume Sino-Japanese trade under pressure from the Japanese people, actually continues to follow the United States, is hostile to China, plays the trick of "two Chinas," and continues to obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, making the wish of the Chinese and Japanese peoples to improve relations and resume trade between the two countries still unfulfilled. The interests of the Chinese people and the Japanese people are the same. The Chinese people cannot sit idly by and watch the revival of Japanese militarism, nor can they tolerate the Kishi government continuing its hostile policy towards China. The Chinese people welcome the great efforts made by the Japanese people to develop friendly relations between the two peoples. We believe that the series of proposals put forward by the representatives of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese Socialist Party during their successive visits to China regarding the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations are completely correct. We believe that the Japanese people will eventually break through all obstacles and develop peaceful and friendly relations with the Chinese people. (Applause)

While further reviving Japanese militarism, American imperialism has intensified its aggressive and war-preparation activities in East Asia. Recently, the United States gathered the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to hold the Wellington meeting, which was to plot new aggressive and subversive activities in the East Asia region, create new tensions, and further tighten its control over the Asian member countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. American imperialism is striving to obstruct the unification of Vietnam, strengthen its military deployment in South Vietnam, incite the Laotian government to abandon the Geneva Agreement, and attempt to turn Laos into its military base. The United States, using the countries it controls, is carrying out blatant subversive activities against the Kingdom of Cambodia. After our People's Volunteer Army voluntarily withdrew from Korea last year, American imperialism not only refused to withdraw its invading troops from South Korea but also, in an escalated manner, transported a large number of military equipment, including nuclear and rocket weapons, to South Korea, supporting the Lee Myung-bak group to call for completely tearing up the Korean Armistice Agreement. The aggressive activities of American imperialism in the East Asia region seriously threaten the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the peace of East Asia. As a party to the Geneva Agreement and the Korean Armistice Agreement, we will absolutely not allow the United States to destroy these agreements and realize its plot of expanding aggression. We are willing to establish and develop friendly and good-neighborly relations with all neighboring countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We advocate the establishment of a nuclear-free zone and a peace zone in the entire East Asia and Pacific region. We believe that this is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of East Asia and the Pacific. China does not want to threaten anyone, does not want to harm anyone, and does not require anyone to change the social and political systems they have chosen. However, we also want to remind those who follow American imperialism, are hostile to our country, and threaten our country that if they insist on this approach, they must bear all the consequences that arise from it. (Applause)

China is willing to establish equal diplomatic relations with all countries. Currently, there are no diplomatic relations between China and the United States, and the relations are very bad. The whole world knows that the responsibility for this situation does not lie with us. We have not run to the United States to show off our military might, blockade it, occupy its territory, or create two Americas. (Laughter) There is only one America in the world, just as there is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. We will definitely liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu. (Stormy applause) All American armed forces in the Taiwan region must withdraw. (Applause) Any plot to split Chinese territory and create "two Chinas" is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. (Applause) Based on this principle, all countries that wish to establish diplomatic relations with our country must sever their so-called diplomatic relations with the Kuomintang group and must respect our legitimate rights in international affairs. We are willing to establish contacts and cooperate with other countries in international organizations and international conferences, but we will not participate in any international activities where the situation of "two Chinas" may arise. The path for the Chinese people to maintain and develop friendly relations with the peoples of all countries is unblocked. The trick of "two Chinas" played by American imperialists and their followers is the same as the American policy of "non-recognition of China," which can only lead them into a dead end. (Prolonged applause)

Comrades! Regarding our cause, whether at home or abroad, the situation is good. Our cause is flourishing and advancing rapidly in all aspects because our cause is a just cause and is supported by the broad masses of the people. (Stormy applause)

Our country will celebrate its glorious tenth anniversary on October 1, 1959. (Applause) When we look back at the development of the past ten years, our hearts are filled with joy and conviction. (Applause) All our achievements are created by the united strength of all patriotic people in our country. (Applause) In the past, we have united all those who can be united; in the future, we will continue to do so. This conference will pass the 1959 national economic plan, and this grand plan requires mobilizing the strength of the entire country to complete. (Applause) During this conference, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is also in session. We believe that these two conferences will make significant contributions to the completion of the tasks of the 1959 plan. (Applause) Let us, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, guided by the general line of building socialism with great, diligent, and practical efforts, with a spirit of striving to catch up and surpass, unite closely, (Applause) use the active actions of completing and overfulfilling the 1959 plan to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, the People's Republic of China! (Everyone stands up, prolonged stormy applause)

　　政府工作报告
　　一九五九年四月十八日在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
　　国务院总理  周恩来
　　各位代表：
　　我现在根据国务院的决定，向第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议作政府工作报告。
　　一、第一个五年计划时期内和第二个五年计划的第一年——一九五八年的伟大成就
　　在第一届全国人民代表大会的四年多的任期中间，我们的国家经历了一系列的具有重大历史意义的变化。
　　当一九五四年第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议召开的时候，我国社会主义经济已经在国民经济中居于主导的地位，但是，我国还存在着大量的资本主义的工业和商业，并且大量地存在着个体的农业和手工业。农村中劳动互助运动已经广泛地发展起来，参加农业劳动互助组的农户达到了百分之六十左右，但是，组成农业生产合作社的农户还只占农户总数的百分之二左右。在那时候，我国已经完成了经济恢复时期的任务，开始了大规模的、有计划的经济建设。但是，究竟我们能不能在一个较短的时间内，使我国这样一个有六亿多人口的大国，建立起社会主义工业化的基础来，还有待于事实的证明。而现在呢？大家看到，只经过四年多的时间，我国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，已经在社会主义革命方面和在社会主义建设方面，获得了多么辉煌的成就！（鼓掌）
　　在一九五五年和一九五六年，我们国家对资本主义工商业和对农业、手工业进行了全面的社会主义改造，基本上完成了在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命的任务。现在，除了个别的少数民族地区以外，我国基本上只有两种生产资料所有制，这就是社会主义的全民所有制和社会主义的集体所有制。在一九五七年和一九五八年上半年，我国人民又进行了全民整风运动和反右派斗争，在思想战线和政治战线方面取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利。这样，在两条道路的斗争中，社会主义就在各个方面基本上战胜了资本主义。（鼓掌）
　　我国的社会主义建设是跟社会主义革命同时进行和互相促进的。从一九五三年到一九五七年，我国执行了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。当我们提出这个计划的时候，帝国主义者曾经宣称那是一个注定要失败的幻想。但是事实上，我们已经在一九五七年超额完成了这个计划，并且在这个基础上，从一九五八年开始执行更加宏伟的第二个五年计划。

　　由于第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成，我国的工农业总产值在一九五七年达到了一千三百八十七亿四千万元，比一九五二年的八百二十七亿一千万元增长百分之六十八。其中，工业总产值达到了六百五十亿二千万元，比一九五二年的二百七十亿一千万元增长百分之一百四十一；手工业总产值达到了一百三十三亿七千万元，比一九五二年的七十三亿一千万元增长百分之八十三；农业总产值达到了六百零三亿五千万元，比一九五二年的四百八十三亿九千万元增长百分之二十五。
　　〔注〕第一个五年计划期间的工农业产值，是以一九五二年的价格作为不变价格计算的。这里列举的一九五七年和一九五二年的工农业产值，就是这样计算的。由于一九五七年调整了部分工农业产品的价格，第二个五年计划期间的工农业产值，都改以一九五七年的价格作为不变价格计算。因此，一九五七年同第二个五年各年度相比的时候，就应当按照一九五七年价格计算。这样，一九五七年的工农业总产值就应当是一千二百四十一亿元，工业和手工业总产值是七百零四亿元，农业总产值是五百三十七亿元。
　　第一个五年计划期间，国家对经济和文化部门的基本建设投资总额共为四百九十三亿元，超过原定计划四百二十七亿四千万元的百分之十五点三。五年内施工的工矿建设单位有一万多个，其中限额以上的有九百二十一个，比计划规定的单位数多二百二十七个；到一九五七年底，全部建成和部分建成而投入生产的限额以上的工矿建设单位有五百三十七个。
　　由于第一个五年计划的完成，我们不仅大大加强了原有的工业部门，而且开始建立了过去没有过的许多工业部门，如冶金设备制造业、采矿设备制造业、发电设备制造业、飞机制造业、汽车制造业、新式机床制造业，以及高级合金钢冶炼业、重要有色金属冶炼业，等等。技术力量也有了很大的增长。一九五七年全国工业中的工程技术人员达到十七万五千人，比一九五二年的五万八千人增长两倍；工业和基本建设方面的职工达到一千零一十九万人，比一九五二年的六百一十五万人增长百分之六十六。由于工业产量的增长和品种的增加，工业材料和设备的自给率也有了提高，如一九五七年钢材的自给率已经达到百分之八十六，机械设备的自给率已经达到百分之六十以上。同时，工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的比重发生了重要的变化。
　　在工农业总产值中，工业和手工业所占的比重，一九五二年为百分之四十一点五，一九五七年上升为百分之五十六点五。在工业总产值中，生产资料工业所占的比重，一九五二年为百分之三十九点七，一九五七年上升为百分之五十二点八。
　　因此，可以说，由于第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成，我国已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。（鼓掌）
　　第二个五年计划的第一年，即一九五八年，出现了一个我国历史上前所未有的国民经济的大跃进。　（鼓掌）
　　一九五八年我国工农业总产值达到了二千零五十亿元，比一九五七年的一千二百四十一亿元增长百分之六十五。其中，工业和手工业总产值达到了一千一百七十亿元，比一九五七年的七百零四亿元增长百分之六十六；生铁、钢、煤炭、发电设备、机车、汽车、动力机械等产品的产量，都比一九五七年增长一倍以上，其中生铁和钢包括一部分土铁土钢。农业总产值达到了八百八十亿元，比一九五七年的五百三十七亿元增长了百分之六十四；粮食、棉花、烤烟等产品的产量，也都比一九五七年增长一倍以上。通过国家预算的基本建设投资总额达到二百一十四亿元，比一九五七年的一百二十六亿元增长百分之七十。
　　许多工农业产品的产量，在一九五八年一年增加的数量，超过了一九五七年比一九五二年增加的数量。例如，一九五七年比一九五二年，钢增加了四百万吨，煤增加了六千四百万吨，机床（不包括简易机床，下同）增加了一万四千三百台，粮食增加了六百一十二亿斤，棉花增加了六百七十三万担；而一九五八年比一九五七年，钢增加了五百七十三万吨，煤增加了一亿四千万吨，机床增加了二万二千台，粮食增加了三千八百亿斤，棉花增加了三千三百五十八万担。
　　跟工业和农业的跃进同时，在运输邮电方面，商业方面，文化教育事业方面，也都出现了巨大的跃进。
　　在一九五八年的大跃进中，我国人民在社会组织方面有了一个伟大的创造，这就是全国农村中根据广大农民的要求而建立的人民公社。　（热烈鼓掌）
　　全国一亿二千万户农民在农业生产合作化的基础上，进一步组成了二万六千多个大规模的、工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社。人民公社这种组织形式是适应我国工农业生产大发展的需要而出现的。它对于我国社会经济的发展将具有极为重大的意义。在我国条件下，它不仅是推动生产力继续向前发展、加速社会主义建设的最好形式，而且是将来全国农村从社会主义集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，从社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好形式。（热烈鼓掌）
　　显然，一九五八年国民经济的发展，不是一般的前进，而是一个巨大的、全面的跃进。　（热烈鼓掌）
　　我国国民经济发展的速度，在资本主义制度下是从来没有过的，也是不可能有的。拿钢来说，英国早在一八八○年，年产量就已经达到一百三十一万吨，到一九三五年，年产量才增加到一千零二万吨。我国的钢产量在一九五二年是一百三十五万吨，到一九五八年就增加到一千一百零八万吨。这就是说，在钢产量上，英国走了五十多年的路，我们只花了六年。（鼓掌）拿煤来说，英国早在一八五四年就已经能够生产六千五百七十万吨，同我国一九五二年生产六千六百四十九万吨的水平大体相等。经过了五十多年的时间，到一九○七年，英国的煤产量才增加到二亿七千万吨，而我国也只花了六年的时间，就在一九五八年达到了这个水平。（鼓掌）英国的煤产量在二十世纪初期曾经两次接近三亿吨，但是，最近二十多年来，一直处于下降和停滞的状态，到一九五八年只有二亿二千万吨左右，已经落在我国的后边。（热烈鼓掌）
　　帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者曾经竭力抹煞我国国民经济的大跃进，因为他们知道，这个事实不可免地要增强全世界人民对于社会主义优越性的信念，加深人们对于资本主义制度的怀疑。当他们无法否认大跃进的事实的时候，又对我们的大跃进进行各种各样的歪曲和诬蔑。他们尽管绞尽脑汁，终究达不到自己的目的。他们说我们这里实行了奴隶劳动。原来，工人农民为自己的幸福而自觉自愿地积极工作，叫做什么“奴隶劳动”，而在饥饿的威胁下不得不替资本家地主当牛马，反而叫做什么“自由劳动”。但是，为什么在西方世界的广大的所谓“自由”劳动者中间充满了忧愁和痛苦，而社会主义的所谓“奴隶”劳动者中间却充满了欢乐和希望呢？他们说我们这里牺牲了广大人民的生活福利。但是，当资本主义世界到处闹着失业的时候，社会主义制度却不仅从根本上消灭了我国旧社会长期遗留下来的失业现象，并且还保证我国六亿多人民的生活水平随着生产发展而逐步提高。在一九五八年的大跃进中，全国职工全年的平均人数比上年增加了约八百万人，城市就业面的扩大达到了空前的程度；在农村，广大的妇女劳动力也从家务劳动中解放出来，参加了农业生产；可是由于工农业生产的全面跃进，而我国机械化的进度又不可能那样快，因而使得城乡劳动力仍然感觉不足。我国人民的收入显著地增加了，社会购买力大大地提高了，社会商品零售总额比上年增加了百分之十六。值得特别指出的是，在我们的生产资料工业跃进的时候，生活资料工业的产值在一九五八年一年中间也增长了百分之三十四，这样的增长速度难道是资本主义世界有过的吗？让西方资产阶级的老爷们叫嚷吧，我们的工人和农民除了失去了失业和挨饿的自由以外，什么也没有失掉。（长时间地热烈鼓掌）
　　我们的大跃进的原因，是帝国主义者所不能够了解和不愿意了解的。我们的大跃进的原因究竟何在呢？
　　一九五八年的大跃进，是在我国社会主义革命胜利和第一个五年计划完成的基础上出现的。我国长时期以来在经济上和文化上“一穷二白”，并不是因为我们缺乏人力和自然资源，而是因为缺乏一个能够适应生产力发展的需要的社会制度。大家知道，我国人口众多，资源丰富，气候条件良好，这些对于发展生产力都极为有利。但是，同样的人口条件和地理条件，不但在半殖民地半封建的旧中国，根本不可能有什么跃进；就是在解放以后，在资本主义工商业和个体农业手工业没有实行社会主义改造以前，在政治战线思想战线没有取得革命性的胜利以前，也不可能发生一九五八年式的大跃进。同时，由于完成了第一个五年计划，建成了一批大规模的现代化的骨干企业，培养了一批能够掌握新技术的人材，我们已经能够自己设计和建设一些比较大型的和技术比较复杂的工业企业，象年产一百五十万吨钢的钢铁联合企业，年产二百四十万吨煤的煤矿，设备总容量为一百万瓩的水电站和六十五万瓩的火电站，等等。如果没有这样的物质技术基础，我们也就不能够有一九五八年的大跃进。
　　但是，一九五八年大跃进的最重要的原因，是在于我们在一九五八年春季总结了第一个五年计划的经验，开始找到了我国建设社会主义的更好的方法，制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。中共中央和毛泽东主席所制定的这条总路线，是一条充分估计到在社会主义革命胜利以后的六亿多人民建设社会主义的积极性，把一切积极因素充分动员起来的路线。一九五八年的大跃进，就是在这条总路线的指引下出现的。　（鼓掌）
　　根据总路线，在工业方面，我们在优先发展重工业、重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针下，实行了以钢为纲、全面跃进。钢是目前工业生产和基本建设中最重要的材料，我国钢产量的不足，妨碍着整个国民经济的发展。因此，我们在一九五八年动员全民的力量增产钢铁，使钢产量由一九五七年的五百三十五万吨增长到一千一百零八万吨。钢产量的跃进直接促进了煤炭工业的跃进，并且造成了机械工业以及其他工业同时跃进的条件。钢铁工业和其他工业为什么能够有这样高的发展速度呢？这是因为，我们在工业战线上实行了中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针，同时在工业管理中实行集中领导同大搞群众运动相结合的工作方法，这就为多快好省地发展工业找到了具体的道路。在一九五八年，我们扩大了地方管理工业建设和工业生产的权限，从而大大提高了各级地方组织和劳动群众大办工业的积极性，大大加快了建设的进度，迅速提高了工业的产量。一九五八年由中央和省、市、自治区两级举办的限额以上的新建和扩建的工矿企业共有一千多个，其中全部建成和部分建成而投入生产的约有七百个，比第一个五年计划期间全部建成和部分建成而投入生产的工矿企业的总和五百三十七个还多；由省、市、自治区、专区、县兴办了大量的限额以下的洋土结合的工矿单位，这些工矿单位绝大部分在一九五八年内已经建成或者部分建成投入生产。此外，人民公社还举办了很多基本上是采用土法生产的工矿单位。由于这些建设，我国的工业生产能力就迅速地增长起来了。
　　当然，一九五八年工业的跃进，主要地还是依靠原有企业的增产。在原有企业中，经过扩充设备、增加人力、改进管理、提高设备利用率和劳动生产率，产量大大增长。大量的企业实行了工人参加管理、干部参加生产，领导人员、技术人员和工人群众互相结合的办法，展开了改进操作技术、改良设备、改进产品设计、合理利用原料、材料、充分利用原有设备、试制和生产新产品、改进生产组织、改革不合理的规章制度的群众运动，从而大大地发挥了原有工业企业的生产潜力。
　　一九五八年农业战线上的伟大成就，同样证明了社会主义建设总路线的威力，证明了工业和农业应当同时并举，可以同时并举，证明了农业和工业同样可以高速度地发展。事实上，一九五八年工农业的跃进，还是由农业开始的。我国农业机械和化学肥料还很少，但是，在把农民的积极性充分发动以后，农产品的单位面积产量却仍然可以迅速地提高。一九五七年修订的全国农业发展纲要，规定粮食的单位面积产量，到一九六七年在全国三类地区分别达到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标，棉花的单位面积产量分别达到六十斤、八十斤、一百斤的指标。实际上，一九五八年全国多数县市就提前实现了农业发展纲要规定的粮食生产指标，全国大部分的产棉地区也提前实现了农业发展纲要规定的棉花生产指标。一九五八年粮食和棉花都出现了不少的大面积高额丰产田。（鼓掌）
　　农民群众采取的提高单位面积产量的措施，包括土（土壤）、肥（肥料）、水（水利）、种（种子）、密（密植）、保（植物保护）、管（田间管理）、工（工具改革）八个方面，也就是通常所说的农业“八字宪法”。在土壤方面，进行了深翻、改良土质和平整土地的大量工作。在肥料方面，去年比过去更加广泛地开辟了肥料来源，并且大量地建立了制造和加工各种肥料的小型工厂和作坊。在水利方面，一九五八年全国灌溉面积比一九五七年增加了四亿八千万亩，即增加了百分之九十以上。在种子方面，稻谷、小麦、棉花等几种主要作物基本上普及了良种，并且在各个地区之间进行了良种交流。在密植方面，广泛地实行了程度不同的密植，并且在合理密植的试验中取得了不少的经验。在植物保护、防治病虫害方面，进行了大量的工作。田间管理在一九五八年有显著的成就；各地推广了丰产田、试验田，某些地方试行了耕作园田化，这些都在农业技术革新中起了积极的带头作用。工具改革在全国范围内得到了初步的进展；运输车子化和滚珠轴承的推广，受到了农民的欢迎；各种新农具的发明创造大量地涌现出来。
　　工农业方面的各种增产措施所以能够推广和奏效，是同整风运动所造成的党同群众的密切联系和群众社会主义觉悟的提高分不开的。党委领导、政治挂帅的原则，已经为广大群众所接受。在全国范围内，实行了干部参加体力劳动、干部种试验田、干部下放、干部同群众同吃同住同劳动等项办法，大大鼓舞了工人和农民的干劲。在各个战线上采取了一系列的措施，反对保守，破除迷信，提倡共产主义风格，提倡敢想敢说敢做、大胆发明创造，进行参观评比，开展社会主义的竞赛和协作。所有这些，都有力地推动了生产建设的高潮，保证了国民经济全面大跃进的实现。　（鼓掌）
　　在我国的社会主义建设事业中，以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国给了我们多方面的援助。苏联在我国第一个五年计划期间帮助我们建设的一百六十六个重大建设项目，对于我国经济建设的发展，起了显著的作用。苏联建国以来的丰富经验，也是我们制订和实现经济建设计划的一项重要的依据。（热烈鼓掌）
　　我们的成绩是巨大的。但是，对于一个六亿多人口的国家说来，我国工农业现在达到的水平仍然是很低的。为了满足经济发展和人民生活改善的巨大需要，我们必须继续进行艰苦的奋斗。我们建设社会主义的时间还很短，实行党所提出的社会主义建设总路线的时间更短，我们的经验还很不足，工作中的缺点还不少，必须继续虚心地学习，没有任何理由自满。我们应当在一九五八年的巨大胜利的基础上，沿着一九五八年所开辟的道路，继续跃进，争取一九五九年在各个战线上获得更大的胜利。（长时间地热烈鼓掌）
　　二、我们在第二个五年计划的第二年——一九五九年经济战线上的任务
　　一九五九年是我国人民在社会主义建设总路线的指导下，执行发展国民经济第二个五年计划的第二年。在一九五八年十一月召开的中国共产党第八届中央委员会第六次全体会议上，曾经讨论了一九五九年发展国民经济的主要任务和方针，提出了钢产量一千八百万吨、煤产量三亿八千万吨、粮食产量一万零五百亿斤、棉花产量一亿担的四项指标。今年四月初，中国共产党第八届中央委员会的第七次全体会议，根据这些指标和今年第一季度生产和建设的情况，通过了一九五九年国民经济计划草案。这个草案，已经由国务院通过，提请这次人民代表大会审议和决定。我们认为，今年全国人民的主要任务，就是积极努力，为完成和超额完成这个以四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而奋斗。　（鼓掌）
　　一九五九年的国民经济计划，是一个继续大跃进的计划。大家从计划草案中可以看到：一九五九年的工农业总产值将比一九五八年的二千零五十亿元增长百分之四十，达到二千八百七十亿元；其中，工业和手工业总产值为一千六百五十亿元，农业总产值为一千二百二十亿元。在三十二种主要工业产品中，产量将增长百分之五十以上的有生铁、钢、原油、硫酸、化学肥料、抗菌素、发电设备、机车、货车、拖拉机、谷物联合收割机、机动脱粒机、动力机械、棉纺机、造纸设备、制糖设备、糖等十七种；其他的产品，除很少数的几种以外，产量也将增长百分之三十以上。有一些产品的产量将成倍地以至几倍地增长。如发电设备，一九五八年我国只生产八十万瓩，一九五九年将生产二百八十万到三百万瓩，增长百分之二百五十到二百七十五。在主要的农业产品中，产量将增长百分之四十以上的有粮食、棉花、黄麻、洋麻、甘蔗、甜菜、花生、油菜子以及猪的饲养头数。
　　一九五九年基本建设投资总额，通过国家预算的部分，拟定为二百七十亿元，比一九五八年的二百一十四亿元增长百分之二十六。在今年进行建设的限额以上的项目共有一千零九十二个，其中包括五十一个钢铁企业，三十三个有色金属企业，一百五十四个机械制造企业，一百八十四个电站，八十三个煤炭企业，十九个采油和炼油企业，五十三个化学工业企业，一百零五个建筑材料企业和木材采伐企业，一百六十一个轻工业企业，二十八个水利工程，五千五百公里的铁路新干线、复线、支线和企业专用线，等等。这些限额以上的建设项目的投资额，约占全年投资总额的三分之二。其余的投资，将用来建设大量的限额以下的项目。
　　为了给工农业生产和基本建设的迅速发展提供必要的运输条件，计划规定，一九五九年的铁路货物运输量将达到五亿二千万吨，比一九五八年的三亿八千万吨增长百分之三十六；交通部直属企业的货物运输量将达到三千五百万吨，比一九五八年的二千八百万吨增长百分之二十五。在农业和轻工业生产继续跃进的基础上，计划规定一九五九年的社会商品零售总额将达到六百五十亿元，比一九五八年的五百四十八亿元增长百分之十九。
　　一九五九年的计划，是根据党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线拟定的，是根据在优先发展重工业的基础上实行工业和农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的一套“两条腿走路”的方针拟定的。这个计划既考虑了我国物质技术条件的客观可能性，也考虑了人民群众革命干劲的主观能动性；既考虑了工业和农业、重工业和轻工业、生产和运输在发展中必须互相适应的要求，也坚持了建设必须有重点、必须优先发展重工业、首先是发展原料、材料工业和以钢为纲的方针。生产一千八百万吨钢，这是工业战线上最重要的任务。为了实现这个任务，在计划中，已经根据可能的条件，努力提高了生铁、煤炭、电力的生产指标和运输的指标，并且对机械工业规定了迅速制造采矿设备、洗煤设备、炼焦设备、轧钢设备、发电设备和运输设备的任务。为了改变原料、材料工业和动力工业落后于加工工业的状况，我们提高了钢材、铜、铝、硫酸、电力等产品产量的增长速度。按照重工业和轻工业同时并举的要求，计划规定一九五九年生产资料的生产增长百分之四十六，生活资料的生产增长百分之三十四。对于人民生活所必需的、特别是在过去一个时期内生产不足的某些日用工业品的增产，在计划中都作了规定。按照工业和农业同时并举的要求，计划规定，一九五九年的工业和手工业总产值比一九五八年增长百分之四十一，农业总产值比一九五八年增长百分之三十九。为了使各种农产品和畜产品的增产同轻工业的发展、人民生活水平的提高这些情况相适应，一九五九年在保证粮食和棉花生产继续大跃进的前提下，提高了麻类、甘蔗、油菜子等作物和猪、牛、马等牲畜的增长速度。工业也将加强对于农业的支援，给农业提供更多的排灌机械、拖拉机、谷物联合收割机、机动脱粒机、胶轮手推车、化学肥料和农药。
　　实现一九五九年的宏伟的国民经济发展计划，将继续扩大我国社会主义的物质基础，将为我国工业的不断跃进和农业的机械化准备更多的条件，将提前超额完成全国农业发展纲要关于粮棉增产的要求，将保证人民的物质生活水平的继续提高。（鼓掌）　
　　一九五九年计划规定的指标比上年增长的百分数，有不少高于一九五八年比上年增长的百分数，如发电量、硫酸、化学肥料、货车、棉纺机、棉纱、棉布、纸、食用植物油、糖等工业产品，和黄麻、洋麻、甘蔗、油菜子、大家畜、猪等农业产品，都是这样。也有一些产品，一九五九年计划产量增长的百分数比一九五八年低，但是，增加的绝对数却比一九五八年高。例如，钢的产量，一九五八年比一九五七年增长了百分之一百零七，即增加了五百七十三万吨；一九五九年比一九五八年计划增长百分之六十二，增长的绝对数却是六百九十二万吨。工农业总产值的情况也是这样：一九五八年比一九五七年增长百分之六十五，即增加了八百零九亿元；一九五九年比一九五八年计划增长百分之四十，增长的绝对数却是八百二十亿元。可见，观察增长的速度不能只看百分比，必须同时看绝对数。如果认为工农业总产值以及每一种产品的产量，每年增长的百分数都必须高于前一年才算是跃进，那是不切实际的。
　　不但如此，有一些工农业产品，特别是有一些农业产品，在跃进的过程中，后一年增加的产量也可能低于前一年增加的产量。一九五九年计划要求粮食增产百分之四十，这无疑是一个非常高的、在历史上少见的速度。应当看到，粮食的增产受到自然条件的很大限制，年复一年地成倍地增长，或者都按一九五八年的增长绝对数增长，是不可能的。在农业机器和化学肥料还很少的条件下，即使每年增产百分之十到二十，就已经算得是跃进了。一九五九年粮食增加的绝对数将达到三千亿斤，这是一个非常巨大的数字。大家知道，我国的粮食总产量，在解放前产量最高的一九三六年，只有二千七百七十四亿斤。在解放以后经济得到恢复的一九五二年，也还只有三千零八十八亿斤。经过第一个五年计划期间的努力，一九五七年才达到了三千七百亿斤。现在我们要在一九五八年增产三千八百亿斤的基础上，再使粮食产量增加三千亿斤，这当然是一个要用极大努力才能实现的跃进计划。
　　〔注〕这里列举的各年粮食总产量，都扣除了大豆的产量。
　　为了实现速度很高、规模宏大的一九五九年计划，全国人民必须继续英勇奋斗，苦干实干巧干，努力克服困难。在国民经济的大发展中，不可能没有困难，在我们这样经济落后、底子薄的国家中更加是如此。在目前一段时期内，许多重要的原料、材料、电力和运输能力赶不上国民经济发展需要的状况，还不可能很快得到彻底改变，这就是我们面临的困难之一。此外，我们也还可能遇到某些难于预料的困难，例如在农业上遭受严重的自然灾害。对于这些困难，我们应当有充分的精神准备，应当用充分的努力去克服。只要我们有准备，并且努力去克服，那末，任何困难都不能阻挡我们取得胜利。（经久不息的掌声）
　　我们有完成一九五九年计划的许多有利条件。一九五八年的大跃进，造成了我们继续大跃进的总前提。我们有了比一九五八年更强大的物质技术基础。我们有了能够促进社会生产力发展的人民公社。六亿多人民由于一九五八年各个战线上的胜利，已经有了更大的信心和干劲，更多的经验和办法。党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，经过一九五八年的实践，已经为更多的干部和群众所掌握。所有这一切，都是我们的有利条件。（鼓掌）
　　为了实现一九五九年的计划，我们应当注意些什么问题呢？当前最重要的问题，就是要加强集中领导，全面安排，抓紧各项组织工作和具体措施，大力开展各个经济战线上的群众运动。
　　在工业战线上，特别需要加强集中领导，以便把中央的力量和地方的力量、国家的力量和群众的力量充分地结合起来，按照国家统一计划的要求，进行全面安排，首先保证重点建设的需要，保证全局性任务的完成。
　　由于社会主义革命的胜利、社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞和人民公社化的成功，各个地方、各个战线上的干部和群众的积极性空前高涨，大家都要求迅速地发展自己所需要的建设事业。这种要求是完全可以理解的，它反映了我们国家的蒸蒸日上的兴旺气象。但是，我们的计划必须建立在客观可能性的基础上。我们的物质技术基础毕竟还很薄弱。我们的物力、财力和人力满足了一定的重点方面的需要，就不可能同样地满足其他各个方面的需要。要解决这种矛盾，就必须采取局部服从整体、首先保证重点的原则。我们根据这个原则制定了一九五九年工业的生产和建设计划，我们也必须根据这个原则执行这个计划。凡是生产和基本建设任务的调整，重要的原料、材料、设备的分配和调度，企业职工的增加和调配，劳动工资制度的改变，以及技术力量的安排，都应当由中央和省、市、自治区两级切实掌握，统一指挥。对于各项生产、建设的具体任务，都应当按照轻重缓急的情况，并且按照原料、材料和设备供应的可能，自上而下地进行排队。例如，机械工业目前最迫切的任务，在于迅速地把计划规定的采矿设备、洗煤设备、炼焦设备、轧钢设备、电站设备、排灌设备和机车车辆制造出来。国家统一调度的原料、材料，就应当首先保证制造这些设备的需要。机器制造部门在具体安排这些设备的制造任务的时候，也应当排定先生产什么设备和什么样型号的设备，以便在时间上和品种上保证重点部门生产和建设的需要。
　　为了按时、按量、按质地完成一九五九年工业生产和基本建设的巨大任务，必须加强组织领导工作，对于生产和建设中的各个环节，经常地进行切实的检查。重要的产品和建设项目，应当排定按旬、按月或者按季的进度表，并且由中央和省、市、自治区两级的领导机关，指定专人，深入到车间或者工地，检查进度和质量，保证计划指标准确地实现。
　　如同历年的经验特别是一九五八年的经验所证明的，完成工业计划的最基本的保证，就是要在工作中贯彻执行群众路线的方法，要使集中领导同开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动结合起来。所有工业企业都必须贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制，都必须认真遵守合理的、必要的规章制度，生产中和建设中无人负责和违背必要的规章制度的现象是不容许的。但是，我们所需要的集中是民主基础上的集中，集中领导不应当妨碍发动群众，而应当保证放手发动群众。应当积极领导职工群众通过职工代表大会和其他会议，采用大鸣大放大辩论的方式，讨论国家计划规定的任务，出主意，想办法，为完成和超额完成任务而奋斗。企业的重要会议，应当广泛地吸收基层单位的干部和群众中的积极分子参加；一切重大事情的决定，都要征求他们的意见。凡是一九五八年已经行之有效的发展群众运动的各种方法，例如党委书记挂帅、领导干部搞“试验田”、召集现场会议、参观评比、开展红旗竞赛的方法，干部参加劳动、工人参加管理的方法，领导人员、技术人员、工人群众互相结合的方法，都必须坚持下去，并且继续加以发展和提高。
　　工业战线上的小型企业、土法生产的群众运动，应当继续开展，逐步提高。这种小型企业的土法生产，在今年的工业生产中，例如，在采矿、洗煤、炼焦、炼铜、建筑材料的生产中，仍然担负着重大的任务；在炼铁、炼钢方面，经过提高技术以后，也仍将占有一定的比重。有些土铁土钢和其他土法生产的产品，虽然质量不够好，成本比较高，但是它们适合于我国目前某些范围内的需要，特别是广大农村的需要。因此，千万不可以小看了它们的作用，小看了就会犯错误。“洋土并举”，这是我们发展工业的长远的方针。“洋土结合”这种事情，是永远存在的，不过将来的“洋”和“土”，在内容上和形式上跟现在不同罢了。当然，无论是那个行业，小型企业的土法生产，都应当注意改进技术、改进操作方法和劳动组织，努力提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量和降低产品成本。小型企业的土法生产逐步采取某些现代化的技术，向所谓洋法生产转化，这是一项必要的任务。这个任务，对于那些占用劳动力和原料比较多的土法生产，应当更快地解决。
　　同在工业战线上一样，在农业、运输邮电和商业的战线上，为了完成一九五九年的计划，都必须坚持群众路线的工作方法，开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
　　在农业战线方面，广大农民已经在去年秋季和冬季，为今年的生产做了大量的准备工作。但是，为了实现今年的跃进计划，还必须继续动员群众，开展大面积丰产的群众运动。公社的干部和县的干部必须深入田间，同社员打成一片，为今年夏季和秋季的大丰收而斗争，为实现今年一月全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议所提出的十大倡议而斗争，为完成和超额完成今年的粮食、棉花、油料作物、麻类作物、糖料作物、各类副食品和林业、牧业、副业、渔业等项生产计划而斗争。
　　一九五八年的农业大跃进，提供了土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工八个方面的增产技术措施的丰富经验。这些经验使我们看到，适应于不同的自然条件和不同的作物，应当采取不同的措施，而不应当千篇一律；各种措施又是互相关连互相依靠的，不能够满足于仅仅采取某一种或某几种措施。我们必须很好地总结这些经验，使各个公社、各个生产队根据自己的具体条件，确定各种适当的增产技术措施，认真执行。
　　农业的继续大跃进，在没有实现农业机械化以前，需要大量的劳动力。人民公社化的实现，公共食堂、托儿所的建立，虽然从家务劳动中把成千成万的妇女解放出来了，但是，由于生产任务大大增加了，所以农村劳动力仍感不足。在目前条件下，从事农业（包括农、林、牧、副、渔各业）的农村劳动力，一般应当不少于百分之八十。为了满足农村劳动力的需要，城市的工矿企业在一个时期内应当停止从农村招工，并且让从农村中招来的多余的临时工回到农村去。县和人民公社举办工矿企业和其他的基本建设，一般要适应于农事季节，农闲时多办，农忙时少办。公社的行政管理人员和生活服务人员也必须厉行精简，凡是可以利用半劳动力和辅助劳动力的，都应当少用或者不用强壮的劳动力。
　　解决农村劳动力不足的根本途径，是提高农业的劳动生产率，是逐步实现技术革新和技术革命，逐步实现农具的半机械化和机械化。在一九五八年开展的农具改革运动，必须继续进行，并且把已经证明合用的改良农具认真地推广和普及。
　　人民公社的巩固，是农业生产顺利发展的前提。党的八届六中全会的决议，使广大干部和群众正确地认识了人民公社在现阶段的社会主义集体所有制性质，认识了人民公社必须实行按劳分配、等价交换，必须实行统一领导、分级管理、分级核算，必须实行民主办社、勤俭办社，这对于人民公社的巩固起了决定性的作用。经过近几个月的整社工作，人民公社的管理制度正在逐步健全起来，干部的作风也有了很大的改进。在最近期间，全国的人民公社都应当召开一次社员代表大会，总结整社工作，检查和布置生产，整理公社账目，讨论夏收分配，并且选举公社的管理机构。我们相信，人民公社在做好这些整顿和建设工作以后，一定会把全体社员的积极性更好地调动起来，人们的干劲会更足，一九五九年的农业增产任务的完成也就会更有保证。（鼓掌）
　　在运输方面，首先是铁路运输方面，为了实现一九五九年的计划，应当努力加强运输组织工作，有效地发挥现有各种运输设备的潜力，同时有计划地完成基本建设的任务。
　　运输部门应当提高运输工作的计划性，力求缩短货物装卸时间，加速车辆和船舶的周转，节约燃料的消耗，以现有的运输设备完成更多的运输任务。对于运输任务，应当分别轻重缓急，适当安排，首先保证钢铁、煤炭等重要生产资料和粮食、副食品等重要生活资料的及时调运。应当特别注意长途运输和短途运输相结合，陆路运输和水路运输相结合。为了加强短途运输，应当大力组织农村人民公社中的车辆和船只，以补充现代运输设备的不足。各个工业部门和商业部门，应当积极地帮助运输部门合理地组织运输，减少以至消除对流运输、过远运输、重复运输等不合理现象。
　　为了保证必要的物资供应，保证市场的继续稳定，商业部门在一九五九年担负着繁重的任务。如前所说，一九五九年的社会商品零售总额将达到六百五十亿元，比一九五八年增长百分之十九；如果同建国初期的一九五零年的一百七十亿元作比较，则增长二点八倍；同第一个五年计划的第一年——一九五三年的三百四十八亿元作比较，也增长了百分之八十七。由于我国人口很多，每人多消费一点，合起来就是一个极大的数量。在生活资料的生产还不能满足需要的情况下，这一种物资或者那一种物资暂时供不应求的现象，是难以完全避免的。对全国市场进行全面安排，尽力做好生活资料的供应工作，尽力防止和减少供求脱节的现象，是当前商业部门的重要任务。
　　各级商业机构，应当努力加强农副产品和日用工业品的收购工作，做好作为工业原料的各种“废品”的收购工作，应当通过购销合同制度，推动农副产品生产的发展，扩大城乡物资交流。同时，还应当加强出口贸易的管理，使国家的出口计划能够按时、按量、按质地完成。
　　无论工业、农业、运输业或者商业战线上，群众运动的中心环节都应当是提高劳动生产率，增加生产，厉行节约，反对浪费。一九五九年国民经济计划的规模是宏伟的，任务是艰巨的。但是，决不能说，我们的潜力已经挖完了，计划指标再不能够超过了。在生产和建设中，技术革新和技术革命的可能性是无限的。改良工具，改善设备，提高设备利用率，改进产品设计和建筑设计，改进操作方法和施工方法，节约劳动力和原料、材料，利用各种代用品和各种“废品”，提高产品质量和工程质量，降低废品次品率，所有这些，都能够提高劳动生产率和降低成本。只要我们坚决地实行政治挂帅，提高干部和群众的思想觉悟，使大家认识一九五九年计划的伟大政治意义和当前问题所在，放手发动群众，那末，我们就一定可以找到增产节约的千方百计。例如，全国煤矿在一二两月份平均的日产量是九十六万吨，三月初在广大的职工群众中开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的竞赛运动以后，三月份的平均日产量迅速上升到一百一十三万吨，从而超额完成了第一季度计划规定的任务。这样的群众运动，不仅在煤炭工业方面，而且在其他工业方面，在农业和运输业方面，也都在开始出现。现在是第二个季度的开始，正是完成年度计划的关键性时机。我们应当在全国的每一个角落，从思想上政治上动员每一个工人、农民、知识分子和每一个爱国的公民的积极性，立即开展一个增产节约的全民运动。我们相信，只要大家能够认真地把这个运动开展起来，坚持到底，我们的一九五九年国民经济计划就一定能够完成，而且能够超额完成！（长时间地热烈鼓掌）
　　三、我们在文化教育战线上的任务
　　随着社会主义的经济高潮的到来，在我国开始兴起了一个社会主义的文化高潮。经过整风运动和反右派斗争以后，在文化教育事业的各个部门、各个单位中间，确立和加强了无产阶级的领导地位，使文化教育的高涨获得了政治的保证。在一九五八年，不但国家举办的各种文教事业都有迅速的发展，而且广大的工人、农民由于迫切地感到掌握文化的需要，也用自己的力量办学校、办科学、办文化，进行各种业余的文艺活动，造成了一个广大群众性的文化革命的局面。文教战线上的知识分子在进行自我改造中，多数人都提高了自己的社会主义积极性，加强了同工农群众和生产劳动的联系，在文化的普及和文化的提高方面积极地发挥了作用。继续调动文教战线上的一切积极因素，向前推进文化革命的事业，普及社会主义的文化，并且不断地在普及的基础上进行巩固和提高的工作，使文教工作的发展能够适应整个社会主义建设的需要，这就是我们的任务。（鼓掌）
　　在过去几年里，特别是在一九五八年，我国的教育事业有了很大的发展。我国的高等学校的学生，一九五二年有十九万人，到了一九五七年已经有四十四万人，即增加一倍多；一九五八年又比一九五七年增加百分之五十，达到六十六万人。中等学校的学生，一九五二年有三百多万人，一九五七年已经有七百多万人，也增加一倍多，一九五八年又比一九五七年增加百分之七十，达到了一千二百万人。小学生，一九五二年有五千一百多万人，一九五七年已经有六千四百多万人，增加百分之二十六，一九五八年又比一九五七年增加百分之三十四，达到了八千六百万人。工人和农民中的业余文化技术政治教育，在一九五八年采取了多种形式，发展很大。扫除文盲的工作也有很大进展。
　　教育事业的成就不只是表现在数量的发展上。更重要的是，在党对教育工作的领导大大加强的条件下，我们按照工人阶级的世界观和社会主义、共产主义的教育原则，贯彻执行了教育为工人阶级的政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，从而展开了教育事业的巨大的深刻的革命。
　　为工人阶级的政治服务，为社会主义事业服务，是我们的教育事业的根本出发点。在我们的学校里必须认真地进行社会主义、共产主义的思想政治教育，提高学生的社会主义觉悟；必须使我们的儿童和青年有系统地一步步地掌握文化知识和现代科学成就，并且在学习过程中养成从事生产劳动的习惯，使他们既能从事脑力劳动，又能从事体力劳动。抱着旧社会中剥削阶级办教育的观点的人，当然要反对我们的方针。其实，资产阶级和其他剥削阶级都在他们的学校中，进行维护他们阶级利益的思想政治教育。资产阶级社会只给工人以一些粗浅的狭隘的知识，而在思想政治上竭力地蒙蔽、麻痹和腐蚀他们。资产阶级一贯地用理论和实际相脱离、脑力劳动和体力劳动相脱离的精神，去培养为剥削制度服务的知识分子。我们的教育方针，是和资产阶级的这种方针根本对立的。我们的方针是要用无产阶级的科学的革命的世界观来武装工人、农民和知识分子，扫除一切剥削阶级思想的影响；要使教育为劳动人民服务，要使文化为劳动人民所掌握，使脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合。
　　在我们的学校中，已经开始把生产劳动正式列入教育计划，按照不同的情况，组织学生参加一定时间的生产劳动。通过生产劳动的实践，广大师生更多地掌握了实际生产知识，树立了热爱劳动和尊重劳动者的风气。在高等学校中，生产实践还有力地推动了科学研究工作。事实证明，教育和生产劳动实行正确的结合，能够有助于加强学校和社会的联系，有助于理论和实际相结合，有助于脑力劳动和体力劳动的逐步结合，能够使得学校日益发展成为培养共产主义新人的新型学校。当然，对于教育事业上的这样一个彻底的革命，我们现在还只具有初步的经验，工作中还有缺点，也还存在着一些需要进一步研究解决的问题。我们应当继续积累和总结经验，不断地改进工作，以便更好地贯彻执行教育和生产劳动相结合的这个方针。
　　我国的教育事业的发展，必须采取普及和提高相结合的办法。为了实现文化的普及，为了能够适应当前国家建设事业发展的迫切需要，除了各级全日制正规学校以外，还应当根据实际可能，继续发展半日制学校、农村和厂矿的业余学校。群众性的扫盲工作应当积极推行。同时，我们必须特别注意提高各类学校的教学质量。去年一年，各级学校都有了很大的发展，现在需要在这个大发展的基础上进行整顿、巩固和提高的工作。在各级全日制的正规学校中，应当把提高教学质量作为一个经常的基本任务，而且应当首先集中较大力量办好一批重点学校，以便为国家培养更高质量的专门人才，迅速促进我国科学文化水平的提高。
　　以除四害、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动和以增强人民体质为目的的体育运动，一九五八年有了很大的成绩，今后必须继续开展。在卫生工作中，应当继续贯彻执行群众路线，使专家和群众结合起来，迅速有效地改进我国人民的卫生面貌。应当团结中西医，组织他们共同为人民卫生事业服务，共同发扬祖国医学遗产和发展医药科学。在体育工作中，应当贯彻执行普及和提高相结合的方针，广泛开展群众性的体育运动，逐步提高我国的体育水平。
　　一九五八年，在科学技术工作方面，开始形成了千军万马向科学进军的群众运动，获得了多方面的研究成果；科学技术工作队伍也有了很大的发展。科学研究机关、高等学校中和工农业生产战线上的许多科学工作者和工程技术人员，在为社会主义建设事业服务中表现了很高的积极性。
　　在科学技术上，我们现在还是落后的，必须加紧努力。直接为生产建设服务的任务，应当放在首要的地位。在生产建设的各个战线上，存在着千千万万的技术课题，科学技术工作者应当分工协作，为解决这些课题而努力。尖端科学技术也必须注意发展；对于条件还不具备的，目前应当从各方面准备条件。基础理论的研究，对于科学技术的发展具有深远的影响，必须给以足够的重视。
　　社会科学方面的理论研究工作也应当积极发展，加强领导。忽视它的重要性是不允许的。应当鼓励社会科学理论工作者在马克思列宁主义指导下，进行有系统的、长时间的努力，充分掌握有关的资料，从事独立的、创造性的研究。在文学艺术战线上，无论是专业的文学家、艺术家的工作，还是工农群众的业余文学艺术活动，都出现了生气勃勃的景象。我们应当鼓励专业的文学家、艺术家，经过艰苦的努力，用思想性和艺术性更高的作品来教育人民群众，满足人民群众的文化生活要求。同时，应当积极地领导群众的文学艺术活动，注意培养从劳动人民中涌现出来的文学艺术人才。
　　为了科学和艺术的健全发展，应当在为社会主义服务的基础上贯彻执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。这个方针指出了我国科学文化繁荣发展的道路，给了整个科学界和文化界以巨大的鼓舞。在一九五六年党提出这个方针以后不久，资产阶级右派分子曾经歪曲这个方针，冒充社会主义的“香花”，向党和社会主义进攻，企图夺取文化事业上的领导权。反右派斗争的胜利粉碎了他们的反动企图。这就造成了执行这个方针的有利条件。社会主义建设的跃进，群众性文化革命的高涨，为科学艺术的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”开辟了广阔的天地。我们相信，经过科学上不同学派、不同见解的自由争论，艺术上不同形式、不同风格的自由竞赛，不要很久，我们的科学文化事业一定能够进入一个昌盛的时代，并且获得伟大的成就。（热烈鼓掌）
　　建立一支成千万人的工人阶级知识分子队伍，是文教战线的一项伟大的历史任务。这支队伍要依靠培养新知识分子和改造旧知识分子而产生。
　　旧知识分子的自我改造工作，近来出现了一个可喜的现象，就是在他们中间有不少人不但真诚地愿意接受党的领导、为建设社会主义服务，而且开始深入群众，定期下厂下乡，参加劳动，取得了同劳动人民在一起生活和劳动的新经验，提高了自己的思想觉悟。有些资产阶级知识分子在长期地认真地进行自我改造以后，已经开始转变为工人阶级的知识分子，他们中间的一些先进分子陆续地加入了中国共产党。这些事实都证明，党和国家一贯执行的团结、教育和改造知识分子的政策是完全正确的。旧知识分子在政治上站到社会主义这一方面来，同广大人民在一起，就能够在社会主义事业中运用他们所掌握的知识和技术，发挥他们的专长，受到人民的欢迎。当然，他们要进一步彻底地同资产阶级的世界观决裂，真正掌握工人阶级的世界观，那还需要一个较长的时期。以为旧知识分子已经不需要再进行自我改造，或者以为他们必须在很短的时间内完成彻底的改造，否则就不能做工作，都是不对的。一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造。我们应当妥善地安排他们的工作，重视他们在工作中的积极性，帮助他们在工作中作出更多的成绩来。同时，要帮助他们进行马克思列宁主义的学习，帮助他们有更多的机会接近群众，了解实际情况，并且根据自愿，适当地参加体力劳动。
　　大量的年青的知识分子，正在象雨后春笋一样地生长起来。他们向着又红又专的方向勇敢地前进，并且已经在各方面的工作中初步作出了他们的贡献，我们应当引导他们努力做出更大的成绩，鼓励他们不断地攀登科学知识的高峰，教育他们在任何时候都不要骄傲自满。年青的知识分子也有经常进行自我改造的任务，他们不论在什么工作岗位上，都应当在努力提高自己的业务水平的同时，认真地学习马克思列宁主义，参加群众的生产和斗争的实践，参加体力劳动，在政治思想上和在工作中严格地要求自己。年青的知识分子要虚心地向有学问的前辈学习，年长的知识分子也要学习青年知识分子的长处。一切爱国的知识分子都应当在社会主义的旗帜下面团结起来，共同为建设伟大的祖国而努力。（热烈鼓掌）
　　四、关于国家的政治生活
　　我国的人民民主专政，人民内部的团结，在各个战线上的社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利以后，比以前任何时期都更加巩固了。（鼓掌）这是因为，第一，在工商业方面，我们基本上用生产资料的全民所有制代替了生产资料的资产阶级所有制，同时付给资本家以定息，从而基本上解决了劳动人民和工商业资产阶级之间的经济上的矛盾；第二，在农业和手工业方面，我们用生产资料的集体所有制代替了农民和手工业者的个体所有制，从而解决了由于个体所有制而产生的农民内部和手工业者内部的矛盾，以及个体经济同社会主义计划经济之间的矛盾；第三，在思想战线和政治战线方面，我们展开了反对资产阶级右派的斗争，粉碎了他们的反共反人民反社会主义的进攻，提高了各阶层人民群众的社会主义觉悟，使右派分子在人民群众中间完全孤立；第四，我们在人民群众首先是人民群众的先进分子的队伍中进行了整风运动，展开了两条道路问题的辩论和教育，展开了反官僚主义、反宗派主义、反主观主义的斗争，大大加强了干部和群众的联系。
　　我国已经基本上肃清了残余的反革命，社会秩序的安定更加有了保障；但是，现在还有极少数反革命分子，必须继续加以肃清。对于被查获的反革命分子，我们将继续执行在过去几年中行之有效的惩办与宽大相结合的政策。对于资产阶级右派分子，我们采取了帮助他们进行改造的宽大处理办法，不剥夺他们的公民权，并且适当地安排他们的工作和生活，以便把一切可以改造的人尽可能地逐步地改造成为新人。
　　现在美帝国主义在西太平洋占领了许多地方，并且占领了我国的台湾，随时都在威胁着我们。因此，我们必须继续巩固国防，加强国防建设，来保卫我国人民的和平建设。（热烈鼓掌）
　　在我国人民内部，如上所说，由于社会主义革命的胜利，特别是由于整风运动的深入，由于毛泽东主席所提出的正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针的逐步贯彻执行，人民民主得到了重大的发展。在今后，应当把整风运动中的一切好办法在我们的政治生活中固定下来，有事要同群众商量，有不同的意见要进行充分讨论。要定期召开干部会、群众会，贴大字报，坚持“言者无罪、闻者足戒”的原则，使人们畅所欲言，不要怕“唱对台戏”，因为只有矛盾充分暴露出来，问题才容易比较迅速、比较妥当地得到解决。无论农村城市，一定要利用三级、四级、五级、六级干部会议的形式，利用有基层干部参加的、有群众中的先进分子和非先进分子参加的干部会议的形式，使党和国家的政策和上级的决定直接同基层干部和群众见面，使群众和基层干部的意见直接同上级见面。经验证明，这种会议最便于集中群众智慧，加强人民内部的团结，是发扬人民民主的一种有效的武器。
　　在过去一年中，国家工作人员在深入群众方面有了显著的进步。广大干部纠正了不同程度的脱离群众的思想和作风，克服了从旧社会沾染来的官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，并且以普通劳动者的姿态在群众中出现。全国县级以上的各级国家机关中，有一百万以上的干部下放到农村，到工矿企业，参加体力劳动和基层工作。同时，农村工作的领导干部定期到公社当社员，工厂的领导干部定期到车间当工人，部队的指挥员定期到连队当兵，一切有体力条件的领导干部定期参加体力劳动，正在形成新的风气。这是一种革命的、共产主义的风气。这不但给干部和群众相结合开辟了新的道路，而且为脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合开辟了新的道路。在一九五九年，全国的各级国家机关应当在总结一九五八年经验的基础上，继续组织干部有计划地、定期地下放和参加体力劳动。
　　我国人民大团结的基础是工人和农民的联盟。通过人民公社运动和整个社会主义事业的跃进，这一联盟是愈来愈巩固了。现在也还有某些不属于工人农民的阶层。在继续加强工农联盟的前提下，在社会主义建设时期，我们将继续保持劳动人民同可以合作的非劳动人民的联盟。
　　经过反右派斗争以后，在各民主党派成员和民族资产阶级分子中间也进行了比较深入的整风运动。他们中许多人通过学习、工作和劳动锻炼，有了不同程度的进步。参加国家工作的许多民主党派成员和其他民主人士，除了一小撮右派分子以外，多数都在自己的工作岗位上尽了他们的职责。各民主党派在整风中都整顿了自己的组织；他们在团结不同的社会力量来为社会主义服务的事业中，仍然起着积极的作用。今后在我国仍然需要在为社会主义服务的基础上继续巩固和发展人民民主统一战线。在承认共产党领导的前提下，共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督，对于人民事业仍然是有益的。对于资本家，国家将按照原定的期限付给定息，并且将积极地帮助他们在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造。
　　在民族工作方面，过去四年中，政府根据宪法的规定，在保证国家统一、实现民族平等的原则下，继续推行民族区域自治，已经收到很大的成效。除了原有的内蒙古自治区以外，先后成立了新疆维吾尔自治区、广西僮族自治区、宁夏回族自治区，并且成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会。此外，还在青海、甘肃、新疆、云南、四川、贵州和其他若干省、自治区内成立了二十九个自治州，五十四个自治县。这些民族自治地方包括三十几个民族。
　　在少数民族地区内，除了西藏和其他很少一些地方以外，都已经完成了民主改革和基本上完成了社会主义改造，并且在这个基础上实现了人民公社化。许多少数民族昨天还受着封建制度甚至奴隶制度的束缚，今天已经走上了社会主义的光明大道。他们真正是在一日千里地向前发展。（经久不息的掌声）
　　在一九五八年，少数民族的经济和文化，也有了巨大的跃进。据统计，内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏四个自治区，一九五八年工业总产值比一九五七年增长百分之八十八，粮食产量也增长了百分之八十三。全国少数民族的学生数目增长得很快。一九五八年上半年小学生有三百一十九万人，中等学校学生三十一万人，高等学校学生一万六千人。在全国的三千六百万的少数民族人口中，学生总数达到三百五十一万人。同解放前比较，小学生增加了六倍以上，中等学校学生增加了七十九倍，高等学校学生增加了二十七倍。有许多过去没有文字的少数民族，现在已经制定了文字方案，有了用自己的文字出版的书籍和报纸。
　　由于民族政策的正确执行，汉族和各兄弟民族以及各兄弟民族之间的友好团结，已经大大加强了。（鼓掌）在汉族干部中，多年以来一直进行着反对大汉族主义倾向的斗争。在许多少数民族地区，在整风运动中，也进行了反对各种形式各种程度的地方民族主义的斗争。广大的少数民族干部和群众，经过整风运动的锻炼和经济文化建设工作的实践，觉悟程度正在不断提高，在他们中间，大批的先进分子正在生长起来。这是少数民族地区的社会主义事业进一步迅速发展的可靠力量。（鼓掌）
　　祖国的统一是全国各民族的最高利益。中国作为一个统一的、多民族的国家，是长期历史发展的结果。帝国主义者开始侵略中国以后，一贯企图瓦解中国的统一，破坏中国各民族的团结，但是他们没有能够达到这个目的。帝国主义的侵略反而使中国各民族的最大多数人民深切感到他们的共同命运，感到统一的国家的可贵。中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的建立，把国内各民族更加紧密地团结在一起了。各族的爱国人民从历史事实的教训中认识到只有在彻底摆脱帝国主义压迫、走上社会主义道路的祖国统一的大家庭中，各民族才能兴旺起来。他们认识到，共产党所领导的人民民主国家，已经从根本上消灭了民族压迫，并且正在努力消除从历史上遗留下来的民族歧视的残余心理。在资本主义制度下，比较发达的、强大的民族总是竭力使别的民族保持落后状态，以便对他们进行压迫和剥削。在社会主义制度下，情形恰恰相反。在我们的国家里，各个民族不但在政治上是平等的，而且在经济、政治、文化各方面，比较先进的、居于多数地位的民族有责任帮助比较落后的、居于少数地位的民族，使大家一起进步，共同发展。（热烈鼓掌）
　　最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的背叛祖国、破坏统一的武装叛乱，已经遭到可耻的失败。政府已经命令解散原西藏地方政府（即噶厦），由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，使西藏迅速实现民族地方自治和逐步进行民主改革。这一措施，受到西藏广大爱国僧俗人民的热烈欢迎。这是我国民族团结政策的一个伟大胜利。（长时间地热烈鼓掌）
　　中央人民政府对于西藏地方的方针历来是明确的。我们根据宪法规定，历来坚持国内各族人民之间的团结和西藏人民本身的团结，主张在西藏实行民族地方自治。中央人民政府一贯坚持宗教信仰自由的政策，并且采取各种积极措施，扶助西藏地方的经济和文化的发展。所有这一切，受到西藏人民的热烈欢迎。根据一九五一年和平解放西藏的十七条协议，西藏地方政府应当团结人民，驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出西藏；西藏的落后的社会制度，必须改革。鉴于西藏上层人士的思想情况，我们曾经允许西藏的改革可以放慢一些，让原西藏地方政府和上层人士有一个充分考虑的时间。但是，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，却继续勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，企图依靠他们的力量来分裂祖国，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力，保存西藏的落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度。他们根本不想实行有人民参加的民主的地方自治，一贯阻挠西藏自治区筹备工作的进行。他们的这种行为，严重地违反了西藏人民的利益和国内各民族的共同利益。所以他们的叛乱行为立即遭到全国各族人民的坚决反对，并且首先遭到西藏的广大人民、包括许多爱国的进步的上层分子的坚决反对。（鼓掌）这些反动分子把形势完全估计错了；他们不知道，帝国主义摆布中国内政的时代早已过去了。（长时间地热烈鼓掌）
　　现在，西藏的局势已经完全在人民解放军西藏军区和西藏自治区筹备委员会的控制之下。人民解放军西藏军区部队，在西藏僧俗人民的积极支持下，正在继续扫荡一些流窜在偏僻地区的残余叛乱分子。西藏自治区筹备委员会已经开始行使地方政府职权。关于西藏今后的社会改革，将由中央同西藏上中层爱国人士和各界人民群众进行充分的协商，以决定实行改革的时机、步骤和办法。无论如何，改革将在充分照顾西藏特点的条件下逐步进行，在改革过程中将充分尊重藏族人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，尊重和发扬藏族的优秀文化。达赖喇嘛虽然已经被劫往印度，我们仍然希望他能够摆脱叛乱分子的挟持，回到祖国来。（鼓掌）
　　西藏反动分子常常装出一付虔诚的模样，说是希望人们同登天堂，但是，他们自己却把西藏变成人间地狱，并且想使西藏人民永远过着暗无天日的生活，陷于比欧洲中世纪更加野蛮、更加残酷的黑暗深渊。他们也常常装出爱好和平的模样，但是，他们实际上却指使匪徒烧杀淫掠，残害群众，并且到了最后，他们自己竟敢疯狂地发动武装叛乱，因而走上了自取灭亡的道路。西藏，包括昌都、前藏、后藏三部分地方，共有人口一百二十万，参加叛乱的人只有两万左右，其中多数是被欺骗裹胁参加的，而且还包括一部分由金沙江以东原西康省地区逃跑去的叛乱分子，即所谓康巴人。在西藏要求改革的劳动人民和赞成改革的上层进步分子以及可以说服的中间分子，共有一百一十几万人。现在世界上有一些人，口口声声说他们同情西藏人，他们却没有区别自己所同情的究竟是那一部分人。是同情一百一十几万要求和赞成改革的劳动人民、进步分子以及可以说服的中间分子呢，还是同情极少数的反动分子呢？我们希望一切好心的朋友（这里所说的好心朋友，是指那些愿意坚持同我国实行和平共处五项原则，和声明不干涉中国内政的人们），（全场活跃）对于这种明显的绝大多数和极少数的划分，应当首先弄清楚。如果人们认识了西藏内部的真实情况，就应当同情受旧制度压迫的绝大多数的西藏劳动人民，同情他们的社会改革的要求。由于西藏反动派叛乱的失败，西藏人民现在已经有可能摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，实现民主自治和社会进步的愿望。他们将在全国各族人民的帮助下，逐步地把西藏高原建成一个真正的人间乐园。（热烈鼓掌）这对于西藏人民、全国各族人民和世界上一切藏族人民的真正同情者，是多么值得高兴的事情啊！（鼓掌）
　　西藏是中国的领土，西藏反动分子的叛乱和这一叛乱的平定，是中国的内政，甚至力图侵略西藏的帝国主义者也无法否认这一点。西藏叛乱事件发生以后，以及达赖喇嘛被叛乱分子劫往印度境内以后，我们伟大的友好邻邦印度尼赫鲁总理连续发表了不干涉中国内政和继续巩固中印友好关系的声明，我们对此表示欢迎。（热烈鼓掌）中印两国有两千多年的友好历史，并且同是首倡和平共处五项原则的国家，我们两国都没有任何理由因为西藏的一小撮叛乱分子而动摇互相间的友谊和两国共同遵守的外交原则。的确，在西藏叛乱失败以前，西藏的反动分子和某些外国的反动分子，曾经利用中印边界的某些地区，进行破坏我国统一和中印友好的活动。但是，这些反动分子的打算现在已经落空了。我们希望，随着西藏叛乱的平定，通过中印双方的共同努力，亚洲两个共有人口超过十亿的伟大的和平国家的友好关系，将获得更加巩固的基础和更好的发展。那些蓄意破坏中印友谊的人们的一切恶意挑拨，不过是枉费心机。（长时间地热烈鼓掌）
　　五、关于对外政策
　　在国内各个战线上取得伟大胜利的同时，我们在对外关系方面，也有了重要的进展。我国同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国在一起，同所有爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，对于保卫世界和平的事业，作了巨大的努力。四年来，同我国建交和半建交的国家，已经由二十个增加到三十三个；同我国建立经济关系的国家和地区，已经有九十三个；建立文化联系和进行友好往来的国家和地区，已经有一百零四个。美帝国主义在国际事务中孤立和排斥新中国的企图，已经一天一天遭到了失败。（经久不息的掌声）
　　目前国际形势的总的特点，就是社会主义的力量、民族独立运动的力量和其他爱好和平的力量迅速发展，而帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，则陷入重重困难之中。正如毛泽东主席所说，敌人在一天天烂下去，我们在一天天好起来。（暴风雨般的掌声）
　　以苏联为首的社会主义阵营正在迅速地向前发展。苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，在发展国民经济、提高人民福利、加强苏联和社会主义阵营的威力、维护世界和平方面，取得了伟大的成就。苏联在首先发射了人造地球卫星之后，又发射了世界上第一个人造行星。不久以前，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，通过了发展国民经济的宏伟的七年计划。这个计划，标志着苏联已经进入一个重要的历史时期——全面开展共产主义社会建设的时期，在全人类面前预告无限美好的共产主义社会的到来，已经为期不远。（经久不息的掌声）其他社会主义国家，也都在迅速地发展着自己的国民经济。整个社会主义阵营现在都处在经济建设的高潮中。完全可以肯定，在一个不很长的历史时期内，苏联将在按人口平均计算的生产水平方面超过美国，中国也将变成一个先进的大工业国，整个社会主义阵营将在物质生产方面显著地超过帝国主义阵营，从而使得世界和平得到充分的保障。（长时间地热烈鼓掌）以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，是更加巩固了。（鼓掌）
    巩固同苏联的团结，巩固同一切社会主义国家的团结，这是我国的根本方针。几年来，我国同苏联和其他社会主义国家友好互助的兄弟关系，有了很大的发展。我们在维护世界和平、促进人类进步的共同事业中，团结一致地紧密合作。一年多以来，我国同苏联签订了关于苏联帮助我国进行重大科学技术研究、帮助我国建设四十七项企业、帮助我国建设七十八项企业的三个协定和通商航海条约，我国同阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古、德意志民主共和国、越南民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、保加利亚，也分别签订了一系列发展友好合作和加强经济、贸易、文化联系的协定。苏联和其他社会主义国家，对于我国的社会主义的经济建设和文化建设，给了巨大的援助。我在这里代表我国政府和人民，向苏联和其他社会主义国家的政府和人民表示深切的感谢。（热烈鼓掌）我们根据亲身的经验深深地感到，社会主义各国互相间的支援和协作，是社会主义各国顺利发展的重要条件。在今后，我们将继续积极地加强我国同苏联和其他兄弟国家在政治、经济、技术、文化和其他方面的合作，并且继续在人民中加强无产阶级国际主义的教育。
　　帝国主义者和各国反动派从来害怕各国人民的团结，尤其害怕社会主义各国人民的团结。近来，他们想出各种卑鄙的主意，企图挑拨中国和苏联这两个最大的社会主义国家之间的友谊。他们仇视中苏两国和社会主义各国之间的友好团结，因为这种友好团结是保卫人类的和平事业和进步事业的强大堡垒，它有利于全世界的人民，有利于全世界的和平，仅仅不利于帝国主义侵略者和各国反动派。但是，中苏两国以及所有社会主义国家友好团结的钢铁堡垒，是以共同利益和共同理想为基础建立起来的，是任何人冲不破的，是永远冲不破的。（热烈鼓掌）敌人愈是要破坏它，就只能使全世界人民更加认识它是人类光明前途的依靠，使全世界更多的人民在这个堡垒的周围团结起来。（鼓掌）
　　社会主义国家始终一贯地声援全世界人民和一切爱好和平国家的维护和平的努力，声援一切被压迫民族反对侵略、反对殖民主义的斗争，声援新独立国家维护民族利益和发展民族经济的事业。很明显，侵略的势力越是受到抑制，和平的事业就越是有保证。（鼓掌）
　　几年来，民族独立运动愈来愈高涨，帝国主义殖民体系正在继续瓦解。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，过去是帝国主义的后方，现在已经成为反对侵略和反对殖民主义的前线。美国政府的发言人也承认，现代殖民主义的支柱美帝国主义已经处在“真正的旋风里”。正象帝国主义过去对埃及的侵略和对叙利亚的威胁遭到了可耻的失败一样，在一九五八年，帝国主义对印度尼西亚的颠复活动，对黎巴嫩、约旦的武装侵略，也遭到了严重的挫败。伊拉克的民族革命运动，冲破了帝国主义和国内反动派的重重压迫，获得了辉煌的胜利。长期遭受帝国主义奴役和掠夺的非洲人民，正在迅速地觉醒起来。非洲大陆上出现了许多新的独立国家。英勇战斗中的阿尔及利亚人民已经成立了自己的政府。刚果、喀麦隆、尼亚萨兰以及非洲其他地区被压迫民族争取自由、独立的斗争，正在蓬勃地发展起来。非洲人民重新成为非洲大陆主人的日子，已经越来越临近了。（热烈鼓掌）在拉丁美洲，民族独立运动同争取民主、反对独裁的斗争结合在一起。古巴人民经过长期的武装斗争之后，终于推翻了美帝国主义一手扶植的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权。这是拉丁美洲民族民主运动新高涨的标志。（鼓掌）
　　帝国主义殖民势力不会自动退出历史舞台，争取和维护民族独立的斗争不会是一帆风顺的。帝国主义殖民势力力求继续保持或者恢复对于新近获得独立的国家的控制。他们在直接进行武力威胁和武装镇压以外，还在拼凑军事集团，缔结军事条约，建立军事基地，加紧经济侵略，策动军事政变，组织颠复活动。特别值得注意的是，帝国主义最近正在用一切办法破坏这些国家的内部团结，破坏这些国家互相之间的团结，破坏这些国家同社会主义国家之间的团结，以达到各个击破、分而治之的目的。因此，一切争取和维护民族独立的国家，为了取得完全的胜利，就不但需要打败帝国主义的武装干涉和侵略，而且需要击破帝国主义的各种阴谋诡计。（鼓掌）
　　中国人民一向同情世界上一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义、反侵略、反干涉的斗争，因为我们的国家不久以前就是一个饱受帝国主义侵略的半殖民地，而现在帝国主义的势力也还盘据在我国的领土台湾。我们对于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的一切民族独立运动，都愿意给予我们力所能及的支持和援助。在近几年阿拉伯民族的反帝斗争中，我们始终是站在阿拉伯各国人民一边的。最近，阿拉伯民族独立运动中出现了某种复杂的情况。阿拉伯联合共和国的一些当权人物发动了对于伊拉克共和国的攻击，并且接着发动了对于阿拉伯各国人民的伟大朋友苏联的攻击。很明显，这种行动不利于阿拉伯民族的独立事业，因而不可能获得阿拉伯各国人民的同情。我们同阿拉伯民族的一切朋友一样，希望阿拉伯民族独立事业所遇到的这个困难能够找到克服的方法，使帝国主义者陷害阿拉伯民族的恶毒的阴谋不能得逞。（鼓掌）
　　我国同亚洲和非洲的一系列新独立的国家发展着良好的外交关系。印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、柬埔寨、锡兰、尼泊尔、阿富汗，一些阿拉伯国家和非洲国家，在国际事务中执行着和平中立的政策。他们反对战争，拒绝被拖入侵略性的军事集团。在反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的共同斗争中，在维护和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的共同努力中，我国同这些国家广泛地建立了友谊。我们很珍视这种友谊，并且很感谢许多友好国家在国际事务中对于我国的支持。（热烈鼓掌）一九五八年以来，我国同也门、缅甸、印度尼西亚、阿联、锡兰、突尼斯、摩洛哥、伊拉克等国先后签订了加强经济贸易联系和文化合作的协定，同时也扩大了同其他一些亚非国家的友好往来。东南亚的许多国家是同我国接壤或者靠近的，我国同这些国家具有共同的利益而没有不能和平解决的争端，因此，我们同这些国家能够而且已经形成亚洲的和平地区。我们希望，这种和平地区将持久地存在下去，并且一直扩大到整个亚洲。（热烈鼓掌）
　　美帝国主义为了挑拨许多东南亚国家同我国的关系，来掩盖它自己对这些国家的侵略活动，故意散布谣言，说什么我国对于东南亚邻国将是“可怕的威胁”。投靠美帝国主义的南斯拉夫修正主义集团，在他们挑拨社会主义各国团结的活动遭到失败以后，也在竭力破坏亚非国家同我国和其他社会主义国家的友好关系。但是，所有这些挑拨离间都是注定要失败的。（鼓掌）人们知道，我国从来没有侵犯过任何邻国的领土，没有干涉过任何邻国的内政，今后也永远是这样。逃窜缅甸的国民党残匪十年来不断骚扰我国边境，威胁我国安全，即使在这种情况下，我国也只是严守边防，仍然耐心地等待我们的友好邻邦缅甸政府自行处理。我国和某些东南亚邻国之间的未定界问题和海外华侨的国籍问题，曾经被挑拨者当做宣传资料。但是，人们知道，我国同一些邻国的未定的边界，是许多历史原因、首先是帝国主义的长期侵略所造成的。我国一向主张根据五项原则，通过和平协商，同有关的国家合理解决这个问题。在这个问题还没有得到解决以前，我们认为，维持现状，不让帝国主义挑拨离间的阴谋得逞，是符合双方利益的。至于华侨问题，我国政府一向劝告海外华侨尊重侨居国的法令和习惯，不参加当地的政治活动，努力帮助当地的人民发展经济；对于华侨根据自愿的原则选择侨居国的国籍，我国政府也采取赞助的态度。有些东南亚国家采取了错误的排华政策，这完全是中了帝国主义造谣挑拨的奸计。我们希望这种现象能够得到纠正，华侨的正当利益能够得到保护。此外，帝国主义还大肆宣传我国在东南亚的所谓“倾销”和“经济扩张”。但是大家知道，社会主义国家根本不需要实行什么“经济扩张”和什么“倾销”。我国国内市场十分广阔，我国对资本主义国家的进出口额只占资本主义世界进出口总额的千分之五，我国对东南亚国家的出口额在这些国家的进口额中也只占百分之一，根本谈不到什么“倾销”，什么“争夺国外市场”。当然，我国和这些国家在自愿和平等互利的原则下发展经济合作的可能性是存在着的。在今后，我们将继续发展这种对双方有益的合作。
　　帝国主义者总是忙着要干涉一切外国的内政，忙着要把整个地球甚至要把月球放在自己的武力控制之下，（笑声）但是，他们却不能管好自己的家务。（笑声）帝国主义国家正在受着经济危机的冲击。他们互相间的冲突正在表面化。尽管帝国主义各国还在寻找某些妥协的办法，暂时和缓他们之间的矛盾，但是，他们的矛盾是无法调和的，资本主义发展不平衡的规律使得这种矛盾日益尖锐化，他们走向四分五裂这一总的趋势是不可避免的。一片暗淡和混乱的景象笼罩着整个帝国主义阵营，西方资产阶级已经失去了对于明天的信心。（鼓掌）
　　社会主义国家始终主张同资本主义国家和平共处，和平竞赛。四年来，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家，为和缓国际紧张局势、保障世界各国人民的和平和安全作了不懈的努力，提出了关于裁军、禁止原子武器和氢武器的试验、举行东西方国家政府首脑会议、建立欧洲的和亚洲及太平洋地区的无原子区和集体安全体系等重大的和平倡议。社会主义国家的这些和平努力和倡议，鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，成为推动国际局势趋向和缓的决定因素。但是，帝国主义好战集团却一直反对这些和平倡议，他们企图用新的战争来扭转历史发展的车轮。北大西洋公约集团、巴格达条约集团、东南亚条约集团还在积极活动，美国还在全世界继续扩展它的军事基地网，还在继续生产原子武器和氢武器，并且用这种武器去武装一系列国家的军队。
　　战争的危险仍然严重地存在着，全世界一切爱好和平的力量必须继续警惕地维护和平，反对战争。甚至在帝国主义阵营内部，头脑比较清醒的人也开始认识到，在社会主义阵营空前强大和各国广大人民坚决反对战争的条件下，发动新的世界战争决不会带来对帝国主义有利的结局，相反，这只会加速整个帝国主义的灭亡和社会主义在世界范围内的胜利。（热烈鼓掌）
　　美帝国主义特别致力于复活德国的和日本的军国主义，指望通过欧洲的和亚洲的这两个老的战争策源地来加剧国际紧张局势。这不能不引起全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的严重注意。
　　美帝国主义在战后长时期以来，一直执行分裂德国和复活西德军国主义的政策。为了消除对欧洲和世界和平的威胁，促进两个德国通过直接谈判解决德意志人民统一祖国的民族任务，苏联和德意志民主共和国提出了一系列合理的建议，并且作了不懈的努力。不久以前，苏联政府又提出了结束西柏林的占领制度和使西柏林成为自由城市的建议，以及由有关国家召开和会讨论并签订对德和约的建议。我国政府支持苏联政府的这些建议。由于苏联政府的一贯努力和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的强烈要求，美、英、法三国已经不得不同意苏联关于召开外长会议和政府首脑会议的建议。我们希望，这些会议将有助于解决成熟了的国际问题，首先是对德和约问题和柏林问题，从而为和缓国际紧张局势打开道路。
　　在东方，美帝国主义一贯扶植日本军国主义复活。日本垄断资本集团，也指望依靠美国，实现其潜在的帝国主义野心。最近，岸信介政府又积极准备修改日美“安全条约”，同美国进行新的军事勾结，并且企图用原子武器装备日本军队。这对于亚洲各国的安全，特别是我国的安全，形成了严重的威胁。中国人民一向支持日本人民要求摆脱美国的控制，采取和平中立政策，使日本成为一个独立、和平、民主国家的正当愿望。
　　为了促进中日两国关系的正常化，我国政府不咎既往，宽大处理了日本侵略中国战争中的绝大部分战争犯罪分子，并且对于日侨的遣返、两国民间贸易的开展和两国人民的友好往来，给予了积极的协助。第四次中日民间贸易协定，就是在我国政府的这种协助下，冲破种种障碍，在去年三月五日签订的。但是，岸信介政府却拒绝给予应有的保证，致使协定无法实施。去年五月，在岸信介政府的纵容下，长崎发生了侮辱我国国旗的事件。去年十月，我国人民解放军炮击金门以后，岸信介本人又公然诬蔑我国是“侵略者”，叫嚣什么不能让中国人民解放台湾。这样，就使得中日关系陷于几乎完全中断的状态。岸信介政府这种反动政策，激起了日本人民极大的愤怒。岸信介政府现在虽然为了应付日本人民的压力，不能不在口头上表示愿意恢复中日贸易，实际上却继续追随美国，敌视中国，玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，继续阻挠中日关系的正常化，致使中日两国人民改善两国关系、恢复两国贸易的愿望至今不能实现。中国人民和日本人民的利益是一致的。中国人民不能坐视日本军国主义的复活，也不能容忍岸信介政府继续采取敌视中国的政策。中国人民欢迎日本人民为了发展两国人民友好关系所作的巨大努力。我们认为，最近日本共产党和日本社会党的代表团在先后访华期间所提出的关于改善中日关系、恢复中日邦交的一系列主张，是完全正确的。我们相信，日本人民终将冲破一切障碍，发展同中国人民的和平友好关系。（热烈鼓掌）
　　美帝国主义在进一步复活日本军国主义的同时，加紧了它在东亚的侵略和备战的活动。最近，美国纠集东南亚条约集团，举行惠灵顿会议，就是为了在东亚地区策划新的侵略和颠复活动，制造新的紧张局势，并且进一步加紧对于东南亚条约集团的亚洲成员国的控制。美帝国主义竭力阻挠越南的统一，加强在南越的军事部署，嗾使老挝当局毁弃日内瓦协议，企图把老挝变为它的军事基地。美国利用它所控制的国家，对柬埔寨王国进行露骨的颠复活动。在中国人民志愿军去年主动地全部撤出了朝鲜以后，美帝国主义不但拒绝从南朝鲜撤走它的侵略军队，而且变本加厉地向南朝鲜运进包括核武器和火箭武器在内的大批军事装备，支持李承晚集团发动完全撕毁朝鲜停战协定的叫嚣。美国在东亚地区的这些侵略活动，严重地威胁到越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国的安全和东亚的和平。作为日内瓦协议和朝鲜停战协定的有关方面，我们绝对不能容许美国破坏这些协议和实现它扩大侵略的阴谋。我们愿意根据和平共处的五项原则，同所有邻邦建立和发展友好的睦邻关系。我们主张在整个东亚和太平洋区域建立无原子武器地区，建立和平地区。我们认为，这是符合于东亚和太平洋各国人民的根本利益的。中国不想威胁任何人，不想损害任何人，不要求任何人改变他们所选择的社会政治制度。但是，我们也要提醒那些追随美帝国主义、敌视我国和威胁我国的人们，如果他们坚持这种做法，他们必须承担由此引起的一切后果。（鼓掌）
　　中国愿意同一切国家建立平等的外交关系。现在中美两国没有外交关系，而且关系很恶劣。全世界都知道，造成这种情况的责任并不在我们方面。我们并没有跑到美国去耀武扬威，封锁它，占领它的领土，或者制造两个美国。（笑声）世界上只有一个美国，同样，世界上只有一个中国。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。我们一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖。（暴风雨般的掌声）台湾地区的一切美国武装力量必须撤走。（鼓掌）任何割裂中国领土、制造“两个中国”的阴谋，都是中国人民绝对不能容许的。（鼓掌）根据这个原则，一切愿意同我国建交的国家，就必须断绝同蒋介石集团的所谓外交关系，必须在国际事务中尊重我国的合法权利。我们愿意在国际组织和国际会议中同其他国家建立联系和进行合作，但是，凡是有可能出现所谓“两个中国”局面的国际活动，我们决不参加。中国人民同世界各国人民保持和发展友好关系的途径是堵塞不了的。美帝国主义者及其追随者制造所谓“两个中国”的把戏，同美国的所谓“不承认中国”的政策一样，只能把他们自己带进死胡同。（长时间地热烈鼓掌）各位代表！对于我们的事业，无论在国内方面，或者是在国际方面，形势都是好的。我们的事业，各方面都在欣欣向荣，都在快步前进，这是因为我们的事业是正义的事业，是受到广大人民支持的事业。（暴风雨般的掌声）
　　我们的国家在今年十月一日将渡过它的光荣的十周年。（鼓掌）当我们回顾十年来的发展的时候，我们大家的心里都充满了愉快和信念。（鼓掌）我们的一切成就是我国全体爱国人民团结一致的力量创造的。（鼓掌）在过去，我们团结了一切能够团结的人；在今后，我们也将继续这样做。我们的这次大会将通过一九五九年的国民经济计划，这个宏伟的计划需要动员全国一切的力量来完成。（鼓掌）在我们这次大会期间，同时举行着中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的会议。我们相信，这两个会议一定能够对于完成一九五九年计划的任务作出重大的贡献。（鼓掌）让我们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导下，紧密地团结起来，（鼓掌）用完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，来迎接我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年！（全体起立，长时间暴风雨般的掌声）
