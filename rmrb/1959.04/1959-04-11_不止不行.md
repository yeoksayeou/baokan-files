　　"Not stopping is not possible."
　　An ancient saying goes: "Not stopping is not possible." That is to say, when walking, the foot must touch the ground. Touching the ground is "stopping." Without "stopping," it is impossible to take another step forward.
　　Tool reform is an eternal advance. However, in the process of reform, the work of sample selection and standardization must be done. Standardization is also "stopping." It cannot be said that because tools need to be continuously improved, standardization is not needed. Without standardization, it is not conducive to promotion, nor is it conducive to continued progress.

    “不止不行”
    古语云：“不止不行。”就是说，走路的时候，脚总是要着地的。着地的时候，就是“止”。不“止”，就不可能再迈步向前。
    工具改革是永远前进的。可是，在改的过程中，必须做选样定型的工作。定型，也就是“止”。不能说，工具要不断地改进，就不需要定型。不定型，就不利于推广，也不利于继续前进。
