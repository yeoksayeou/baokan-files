Title: A Farce Without an Audience

The hypocritical face put on by the Indian expansionists after the failure of the rebellion in Tibet cannot help but remind us of the hypocrisy depicted by Molière. Look how ridiculous this farce they have personally written and performed is! They are reading their lines with tearful eyes and strained voices, talking about "helping Tibetan refugees," and how Tibet is "a very small and weak neighbor that should receive pity and sympathy," etc., etc., as if they are the number one arbiters of justice in the world. But the game is up; beneath these pathetic words is nothing but a pile of unspeakable filth.

They do indeed have sympathy and offer help. But they sympathize with and help not the broad masses of the Tibetan people, but a small handful of Tibetan rebels. This small handful of rebels is the mountain weighing down on the heads of the Tibetan people, the stumbling block preventing the Tibetan people from embarking on the broad road to freedom and happiness, and should be punished by everyone; yet the Indian expansionists want to reach out their arms to welcome them, to speak up for them, and even to handle statements on their behalf, vainly hoping to fish in troubled waters. Although these clowns, before taking the stage, use clumsy tricks to write the words "justice" on their foreheads, disguising themselves as gentlemen who sympathize with the weak, in order to confuse the public, it is all in vain. Just like the thief who covers his ears while stealing the bell, he can only prevent his own covered ears from hearing the bell, but can he prevent others from hearing it? We advise the actors of this farce of "hypocrisy" to retreat backstage and lower the curtain as soon as possible, given the sparse audience and the chorus of boos!

    没有观众的丑剧
    李素
    印度扩张主义分子在西藏叛乱失败后装出的一副假慈悲面孔，不禁使我们想起了莫里哀所描绘的“伪君子”的丑态。请看，由他们亲自编演的这一幕丑剧是多么滑稽可笑啊！他们眼泪汪汪、声嘶力竭地在那儿读台词，什么“帮助西藏难民”，什么西藏“是个非常弱小的邻人，它应该得到怜悯和同情”，等等，等等，好像他们真正是天字第一号主持公道的人一样。但是，西洋镜戳穿了，在这些可怜巴巴的话语掩盖之下，不过是一团见不得人的脏东西罢了。
    他们也确是有所同情，有所帮助的。但他们同情帮助的不是西藏广大人民，而是一小撮西藏叛乱分子。这一小撮叛乱分子，是压在西藏人民头上的大山，是阻碍西藏人民走上自由幸福的康庄大道的绊脚石，是人人得而诛之的；可是印度扩张主义分子却要伸出双臂去欢迎他们，去为他们奔走呼吁，甚至包办声明，妄想混水摸鱼捞上一把。尽管这些丑角在上台之前，使用拙劣的伎俩在自己额上写上正义的字眼，把自己装成是同情弱小的君子，以求混淆视听，结果也是枉然。正如掩耳盗铃的小偷，只能使他自己被掩住的耳朵听不见铃声，难道能使别人也听不见铃声么？奉劝这一出“伪君子”的丑剧的扮演者们，在观众寥落、嘘声四起的情况下，还是早点退入后台，拉下幕布吧！
