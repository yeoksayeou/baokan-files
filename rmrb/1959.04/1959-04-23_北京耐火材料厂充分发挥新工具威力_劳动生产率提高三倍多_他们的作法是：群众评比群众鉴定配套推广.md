    Beijing Refractory Materials Factory Fully Utilizes the Power of New Tools
    Labor Productivity Increases More Than Threefold
    Their Approach: Mass Appraisal, Mass Assessment, Coordinated Promotion
    (By our reporter Zhou Dingfang) The many new tools created by the construction workers of the Beijing Refractory Materials Factory, after being standardized, coordinated, and universally promoted, doubled the daily output value within half a month, increased labor productivity by three to five times, and greatly accelerated the progress of the project.
    The Beijing Refractory Materials Factory is one of Beijing's key projects, with a construction area of over 49,000 square meters. The construction period is tight, the amount of on-site transportation is large, and a large amount of concrete needs to be poured on-site, requiring a large number of laborers and timber. According to the existing construction strength of the construction site at that time, to ensure the project is completed on schedule, it would be necessary to add 300 workers, 8,100 fir poles, and 1,500 cubic meters of timber. After actively promoting the achievements of the technical revolution, this construction site not only did not need to increase manpower and materials but instead transferred 450 workers and more than 3,000 fir poles to support the construction of other key projects; the construction period is expected to be shortened by one month compared to the original plan.
    The approach taken by this construction site in the technical revolution, of standardizing, coordinating, and promoting, is as follows: The Party branch of the construction site first organized the masses to conduct appraisal and assessment of more than 200 kinds of simple machines created by the workers. During the assessment, the workers, based on the principles of truly improving efficiency, saving raw materials, reducing labor intensity, ensuring quality and safety, and after mutual research and improvement, selected 44 of the most suitable new tools for standardization and promotion. Liu Fengchao, the head of the bricklayers, created a mobile scaffold that could be used to build bricks without scaffolding. When the bricklayers assessed it, they believed that the advantage of this tool was that it was very simple and could save a lot of raw materials, but the disadvantage was that the scaffold was raised and lowered with ropes, which was neither safe nor convenient. After everyone's research and improvement, these shortcomings were overcome; as a result of the standardization and promotion, a total of more than 10,000 fir poles were saved. The mobile formwork for pouring concrete created by carpenter Li Qingfu was also standardized after four assessments and improvements by the carpenters. Using this formwork to pour concrete can save 99.4% of timber.
    In the process of universally promoting standardized new tools, contradictions arose between the connected processes where production could not proceed in a balanced manner. According to the characteristics of the interconnection of various processes in the construction industry, the Party branch of the construction site promptly coordinated the 44 standardized tools into 13 sets of tools. Each set of tools became a complete sequence of operation and transportation, so that the upper, lower, left, and right sides of each process were closely coordinated. Therefore, labor efficiency was increased by three to five times compared to the time of standardization. When promoting the method of continuous transportation using one winch to drive seven buckets, the transportation efficiency from the ground to the high altitude was increased by five times, while the transportation on the ground remained at the level of three loading and unloading operations in the past. After the leaders of the construction site discovered this problem, they immediately used a dual-purpose trolley that could push and lift, created by workshop director Gu Minzu, in conjunction with the continuous transportation. This trolley can send bricks from the ground to the bricklayers building at high altitude with just one loading and unloading operation, increasing the efficiency of continuous transportation by more than three times. When promoting mobile formwork, because of the high-altitude operations, moving cement up and down often affected the pouring speed. The concrete workers coordinated the mobile vibrator for mixing cement, the live-bottom ash bucket, and the lifting work platform they created into a complete set of tools for promotion. This not only doubled the speed of pouring concrete and reduced the number of operators by one-third, but also made the poured concrete smooth and flat with good quality. The bricklayers coordinated the three new tools of rope ladder, earth winch, and mobile work platform into a set, which could be used to build a chimney as high as 25 meters without scaffolding inside and out, saving more than 40 cubic meters of timber, two-thirds of the labor force, and speeding up the construction period by two times.
    The Beijing Refractory Materials Factory construction site adopts the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians to standardize, coordinate, and promote new tools. They assess and promote simultaneously, so that the achievements of the technical revolution quickly serve production. The workers said: "This technical revolution is more detailed and more practical than in the past. In the past, more models were made, and fewer were used in production. This time, we learn what is good, learn it and use it, and it is effective when used." (Attached picture)

    北京耐火材料厂充分发挥新工具威力
    劳动生产率提高三倍多
    他们的作法是：群众评比群众鉴定配套推广
    本报讯　记者周定舫报道：北京耐火材料厂工地职工创造的许多新工具，经过定型、配套和普遍推广以后，半个月内就使日产值翻了一番，劳动生产率提高三倍到五倍，大大加快了工程的进度。
    北京耐火材料厂是北京市重点工程之一，建筑面积达四万九千多平方公尺。它的工期紧，场内运输量大，现场浇灌混凝土多，需要大批劳动力和木料。根据当时工地现有的施工力量计算，要保证工程如期竣工，还需要增添工人三百名、杉槁八千一百根和木料一千五百立方公尺。在积极地推广技术革命成果以后，这个工地不仅不需要增加人力和材料，反而抽出了四百五十名工人和三千多根杉槁，去支援其他重点工程的建设；工期预计比原计划还能缩短一个月。
    这个工地在技术革命中采取定型、配套、推广的做法是这样的：工地的党支部首先把职工创造的二百多种简易机械，发动群众进行一次评比和鉴定。在鉴定中，职工们根据确实能够提高效率、节约原材料、减轻劳动强度、保证质量和安全的原则，经过相互研究和改进，选择出四十四种最能适用的新工具，定型推广。瓦工队长刘凤潮创制成一种不用搭脚手架就能砌砖的活动脚手板，瓦工们在给它作鉴定时，认为这种工具的优点是十分简易，能够节约大量原材料，缺点是脚手板用绳索升降，既不安全，又不方便。经过大家研究改进后，克服了这些缺点；定型推广的结果，总共节省了一万多根杉槁。木工李庆福创造的浇灌混凝土的活动模板，也经过木工们四次鉴定和改进才定了型。采用这种模板浇灌混凝土，能够节省99.4％的木料。
    在普遍推广定型新工具的过程中，各个相连接的工序之间出现了生产不能平衡进行的矛盾。工地党支部根据建筑业各个工序互相连接的特点，及时地把四十四种定型工具，配合成十三套工具，每套工具都成为一套完整的操作和运输的序列，使各个工序的上下左右之间得到紧密的配合，因此劳动效率又比定型时提高了三倍到五倍。在推广用一架卷扬机带动七个吊斗的连串运输方法时，地面到高空一段的运输效率提高了五倍，而地面一段的运输，仍旧停留在过去三次装卸的水平。工地领导部门发现这个问题后，立刻把工号主任顾民祖创造的一种能推、能吊的两用小车和连串运输配在一起使用。这种小车只要经过一次装卸就能把砖从地面送到在高空砌砖的瓦工手里，使连串运输的效率又提高了三倍以上。在推广活动模板时，因为在高处作业，上下搬运水泥常常影响浇灌速度。混凝土工人就把自己创造的搅拌水泥用的活动震捣器、活底盛灰桶和能升降的操作台，配成一套完整的工具加以推广，不仅使浇灌混凝土的速度加快一倍，操作工人减少三分之一，而且浇灌成的混凝土也光滑平整，质量良好。瓦工们把绳梯、土卷扬机和活动操作台三种新工具配成一套，可以不用搭里外脚手架，就能砌成一座高达二十五公尺的烟囱，节约木料四十多立方公尺，劳动力三分之二，工期还能加快两倍。
    北京耐火材料厂工地给新工具定型、配套、推广，都是采取领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的方法进行的。他们边鉴定、边推广，使技术革命的成果迅速地为生产服务。工人们说：“这次技术革命比过去做得更细致，更踏实。过去做模型多，用在生产上少。这次是好的就学，学了就用，用了就见效。”（附图片）
