Concentrating Superior Forces to Rush Rice Transplanting
An'yi Ensures Completion of Planting Tasks from Organizational, Ideological, and Technical Aspects
Liuyang Suburban Commune Mobilizes Masses to Contribute Ideas and Suggestions to Tap Labor Potential
    Our newspaper, Nanchang, 12th dispatch: An'yi County, Jiangxi Province, has adopted ten measures to ensure the completion of early rice transplanting tasks on time, with guaranteed quality, and according to plan.
    An'yi County plans to plant 220,000 mu of early rice this year, with the aim of increasing the yield per mu from 800 jin last year to 1,200 jin. This year, the early rice transplanting season has been brought forward, and crops such as cotton, oilseeds, and miscellaneous grains also need to be planted simultaneously. Time is short, and labor is strained. After organizing mass discussions and repeated studies, the An'yi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward ten measures from organizational work, ideological work, and technical work to ensure the smooth completion of the early rice transplanting task. The ten measures are:
    1. The entire population participates in rice transplanting. During the transplanting period, it is determined that more than 90% of the labor force will be invested in the planting campaign. The methods of mobilizing labor are "squeeze, compress, stop, and replace." "Squeeze": Employees in organs, factories, enterprises, and shop assistants should be used as two people, squeezing out as much as possible; "Compress": Resolutely compress industrial and sideline labor that can be compressed; "Stop": Temporary sideline businesses that can be suspended should be suspended; "Replace": Service personnel such as in canteens should implement "four replacements" (female replace male, old replace young, weak replace strong, novice transplanters replace skilled transplanters). Through these methods, strong labor is freed up to participate in transplanting.
    2. Cadres at all levels go to the front line. County, commune, brigade, and production team levels establish transplanting command posts, and party secretaries and members at all levels, brigade and production team cadres, and all rural work cadres take the lead and act as "three personnel" (commanders, combatants, and technicians). They also implement "three guarantees" at each level (guarantee ideological education, guarantee the implementation of various technical measures, and guarantee the completion of transplanting tasks on time, with guaranteed quality, and according to plan), with each level being responsible.
    3. In order to concentrate forces and maximize the role of everyone in the county, the transplanting campaign is arranged in "four battles" in stages. These are: before the end of March, fight a "guerrilla war" and start trial planting universally; before "Qingming" (Tomb Sweeping Day), fight a "mobile war" and complete part of the planting task; before "Guyu" (Grain Rain), fight the "Huaihai Campaign" and complete 60%-70% of the planting task; and before the end of April, fight a "mopping-up war" and end the planting task. During the transplanting period, work points should be evaluated and recorded in the fields.
    4. Achieve "ten requirements" to improve the quality of transplanting. The "ten requirements" are: the field should be level and the mud should be thick; planting should be uniform; handle seedlings gently; use the three-finger method for transplanting; align with the wind; plant upright; seedlings should be pulled and planted the same day; pull seedlings neatly; meet specifications; and complete the task on time.
    5. Use advanced tools to speed up transplanting. Require that every team has transplanting machines. Hold on-site transplanting meetings to train transplanting machine operators. At the same time, make full use of tractors for plowing fields; in areas with insufficient water sources, install water pumps to ensure that the seedlings have enough water after transplanting.
    6. Do a good job in experimental fields, set up banners, set examples, and drive large-area high-yield fields.
    7. Persist in appraisals and competitions, and implement "daily inspections, daily appraisals, small awards every day, and big awards every five days." The reward methods include sending good news reports, honor rolls, inserting red flags, recording merits, and verbal praise. Through appraisals and competitions, create a lively, cheerful, pleasant labor atmosphere, where everyone strives to be the best and everyone inserts red flags, so as to promote the transplanting campaign.
    8. Achieve "five on the fields," namely, medical teams on the fields, barbers on the fields, peddlers on the fields, cooks delivering tea and meals on the fields, and supply of production materials on the fields.
    9. Carry out "five cooperations" in terms of labor, cattle, farm tools, and seedlings, namely, cooperation between areas with less land and areas with more land; cooperation between areas with late seasons and areas with early seasons; cooperation between areas with more cattle and areas with fewer cattle; cooperation between areas with surplus seedlings and areas with a shortage of seedlings; cooperation between areas with slow progress and areas with fast progress. Cooperation should adhere to the principle of equivalent exchange.
    10. Before transplanting, widely organize commune members to conduct a major debate, and formulate different reasonable close planting specifications and methods that are conducive to local yield increases according to different situations and last year's experience. During transplanting, each commune organizes specialized technical guidance groups and inspection groups to provide guidance and inspection plot by plot to ensure that each plot meets the close planting specifications.
    At present, the people of An'yi County are implementing the above ten measures. The county has transferred more than 4,000 strong laborers from logistics and other departments to participate in transplanting; through organizing commune members to debate, the communes and production teams have formulated reasonable close planting specifications and transplanting methods; each team has manufactured transplanting machines and trained a large number of skilled transplanters.

    Our newspaper, Changsha, 12th dispatch: The Liuyang Suburban People's Commune in Hunan Province has adopted various effective measures to overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor during the early rice transplanting season.

    On the one hand, the commune party committee mobilized cadres and the masses to carry out a major debate, so that everyone realized the importance of ensuring that the farming season is not missed in order to strive for a bumper harvest of early rice; at the same time, it also mobilized the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions, and found many effective ways to solve the problem of insufficient labor. These methods are: First, implement the queuing of agricultural work, and arrange them uniformly according to the season. Around early rice transplanting, as well as the sowing of other crops and the harvesting of winter crops, there are a total of ten major production contents and one hundred and three agricultural tasks. Among these agricultural tasks, there are twenty-eight items such as cultivating sweet potato seedlings, planting sugarcane, and jute that can be appropriately advanced, and twelve agricultural tasks can be appropriately postponed. In this way, what can be advanced should be resolutely advanced, and what can be postponed should be appropriately postponed, so as to avoid squeezing them into one time after the transplanting is fully started. Second, tap potential and adopt the methods of "two finds" (find labor potential, find tricks to improve work efficiency) and "three cleans" (clean up logistics service personnel, clean up young and middle-aged labor, clean up various production personnel) to find more than 4,000 laborers to invest in the transplanting battle, ensuring that 85% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture. The labor force used in agricultural production is divided into three routes before transplanting: the first route is to grasp plowing and harrowing and fertilizer production and transportation with 72% of the labor force; the second route is to grasp seedling cultivation, seedling protection, and cultivation of strong seedlings with 8% of the labor force; and the third route is to grasp summer harvest crops and the sowing and cultivation of economic crops with 20% of the labor force. Once transplanting begins, arrange 80% of the labor force for transplanting, 15% of the labor force for plowing and harrowing, and 5% of the labor force to do a good job in the field management of the early rice sown earlier. Third, continue to vigorously carry out tool reform. Repair and add 8,500 earth carts, convert 4,300 earth carts to flatbed carts, and promote 5,345 pieces of various successfully tested new-style tools. In addition, all the tools required for transplanting, such as row markers, are repaired, and each person has a set of rain gear to ensure that they are unimpeded by wind and rain. Fourth, carry out labor competitions between teams, groups, and individuals with the content of comparing progress, comparing work efficiency, comparing the implementation of plans, comparing the completion of tasks, comparing labor organization, and comparing ideological mobilization. Fifth, promote advanced operating methods. Sixth, all departments fully cooperate, resolutely do a good job in mass life, supply and marketing cooperatives implement door-to-door delivery, health departments prevent and treat diseases in the fields, and canteens must ensure that commune members eat enough and eat well, and have plenty of energy.
    Through comprehensive arrangements, not only has the team been organized reasonably, but also the confidence of the masses has been further boosted. At present, the commune's twenty-five brigades have established transplanting command posts, and also formed 5,870 transplanting battle groups, and more than 27,000 transplanting technicians have been trained. A high work efficiency competition movement with the preparation for transplanting as the central content is being carried out between teams, groups, and individuals.

　　集中优势兵力突击插秧
　　安义从组织、思想、技术各方面保证完成栽种任务
    浏阳城郊公社发动群众献计献策挖掘劳动潜力
    本报南昌12日电　江西省安义县采取十项措施，保证按时按质按计划完成早稻插秧任务。
    安义县计划今年种植二十二万亩早稻，亩产量要在去年八百斤基础上提高到一千二百斤。今年早稻插秧的季节提前，棉花、油料、杂粮等作物也同时要耕种。时间短，劳力紧张。中共安义县委经过组织群众讨论和反复研究，从组织工作、思想工作、技术工作等方面提出了十项措施，以保证过好早稻插秧关。十项措施是：
    一、全民参加栽秧。插秧期间，确定以90％以上的劳动力投入栽种运动。调集劳力的办法是“挤、压、停、换”。“挤”：机关、工厂、企业中的职工和商店营业员，一个人当两个人用，能挤的尽量挤出来；“压”：凡是可以压缩的工业和副业劳力，坚决压缩；“停”：可停办的临时性副业一律停办；“换”：食堂等服务性人员，实行“四换”（女换男，老换少，弱换强，插秧生手换插秧熟手）。通过这些办法，腾出强劳力参加插秧。
    二、各级干部都上前线。县、公社、大队、生产队等层层成立插秧指挥部，各级党委书记和委员，大队和生产队干部，以及所有农村工作干部都身先士卒，当好“三员”（指挥员、战斗员、技术员）。并层层实行“三包”（包思想教育，包贯彻执行各项技术措施，包按时按质按计划完成插秧任务），层层负责。
    三、为了便于集中力量突击，发挥全县每一个人的最大作用，将插秧运动安排为“四个战役”分段进行。这就是：3月底以前打“游击战”，普遍开始试栽；“清明”以前打“运动战”，完成一部分栽种任务；“谷雨”以前打“淮海战”，完成栽种任务60％—70％；4月底以前打“扫尾战”，结束栽种任务。插秧时期，要实行田头评工记分。
    四、作到“十要”，提高插秧质量。“十要”是：要田平泥糊；要栽得均匀；要手脚轻放；要用三指法插秧；要顺风定行；要栽得端正；要日扯日栽；要扯秧整齐；要合乎规格；要按时完成任务。
    五、采用先进工具，加快插秧速度。要求队队有插秧机。召开插秧现场会，训练插秧机手。同时，充分利用拖拉机耕田；水源不足的地区，安装好抽水机，保证秧苗插下后就有足够用的水。
    六、搞好试验田，树立旗帜，做出榜样，带动大面积丰产田。
    七、坚持评比竞赛，实行“天天检查、日日评比，一天一小奖，五天一大奖”。奖励办法采用送喜报、光荣榜、插红旗、记功、口头表扬等形式。通过评比竞赛，造成生动活泼、心情舒畅、劳动愉快、个个争上游、个个插红旗的局面，以推动插秧运动。
    八、作到“五上田”，即医疗队上田、理发员上田、货郎担上田、炊事员送茶送饭上田、生产资料供应上田。
    九、在劳力、耕牛、农具、秧苗等方面开展“五协作”，即田少地区与田多地区协作；季节晚地区与季节早地区协作；牛多地区与牛少地区协作；余秧地区与缺秧地区协作；进度缓地区与进度快地区协作。协作要坚持等价交换原则。
    十、插秧前，广泛组织社员进行一次大辩论，根据不同的情况和去年的经验，因地制宜地制定不同的有利当地增产的合理密植的规格和方式。插秧时，各公社组织专门的技术指导组、检查组逐丘指导、检查，保证丘丘符合密植规格。
    目前，安义县人民正在贯彻执行上述十项措施。全县已从后勤等部门抽调出四千多个强劳力投入插秧；各公社生产队通过组织社员辩论，已制定出了合理的密植规格和插秧的方式；队队制造了插秧机，训练了大批插秧能手。
    本报长沙12日电　湖南浏阳城郊人民公社，采取各种有效措施，克服早稻插秧时期劳力不足的困难。
    公社党委会一方面发动干部和群众开展大辩论，使大家认识到，保证不误农时，对争取早稻丰收的重要意义；同时，又发动群众献计献策，找到了许多解决劳力不足问题的有效办法。这些办法是：第一、实行农活排队，根据季节，统一进行安排。围绕早稻插秧，以及其他作物的播种和冬种作物的收获，共有十大生产内容，一百零三项农活。这些农活中有培育薯秧、种甘蔗、黄麻等二十八项可以适当提前，还有十二项农活可以适当推后。这样能够提前的就坚决提前，能够推后的就适当推后，以免在插秧全面开始后挤在一个时间去作。第二、挖潜力，采取“两找”（找劳动潜力、找提高工效窍门）、“三清”（清理后勤服务人员、清理青壮年劳动力、清理各种生产用人）的办法，找出了四千多个劳动力投入插秧战斗，保证有85％的劳力搞农业。用在农业生产方面的劳动力在插秧以前兵分三路：第一路是以72％的劳力抓犁耙和制肥运肥；第二路是以8％的劳动力抓育秧、护秧、培育壮秧；第三路以20％的劳力抓夏收作物和经济作物的播种和培育。一到插秧开始，就安排80％的劳动力插秧，15％的劳动力搞犁耙，5％的劳动力作好先播下的早稻的田间管理。第三、继续大闹工具改革。修理和添置土车子八千五百部，土车改板车四千三百部，推广试验成功的各种新式工具五千三百四十五件。此外，插秧所需要的划行器等工具全部修好，并做到每人有一套雨具，保证风雨无阻。第四、开展以比进度、比工效、比计划贯彻执行、比完成任务、比劳动组织、比思想发动为内容的队与队、组与组、人与人之间的劳动竞赛。第五、推广先进的操作方法，第六、各部门全力协作，坚决搞好群众生活，供销社实行送货上门，卫生部门到田间防治疾病，食堂要保证社员吃饱吃好，精力充沛。
    通过全面安排，不仅合理地组织了队伍，还更进一步鼓舞了群众的信心。目前，全社二十五个大队，队队成立了插秧指挥所，还组成了插秧战斗小组五千八百七十个，已训练好插秧技术员二万七千多人。一个以作好插秧准备为中心内容的高工效竞赛运动，正在队与队、组与组、人与人之间开展着。
