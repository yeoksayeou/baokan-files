Esteemed Presidium Members, Esteemed Committee Members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, as well as the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Li Weihan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Now, I would like to discuss the issue of higher education for overseas Chinese students, and also touch upon the remedial education for some of these students.

Our country has a large number of overseas Chinese, distributed all over the world, numbering over 12 million. Especially in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, which are located by the sea and have well-developed transportation, a significant number of overseas Chinese ventured across the oceans to make a living abroad.

Since liberation, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party and the government, the socialist construction has progressed rapidly; our country's international standing has greatly improved. This thriving atmosphere attracts vast numbers of overseas Chinese. Moreover, the Party and the country's meticulous care for overseas Chinese makes them feel the infinite warmth of the motherland. The vast majority of overseas Chinese and compatriots living in Hong Kong and Macau are willing to send their children back to the motherland to receive the education of the Party and the motherland.

1958 was a year of great leap forward for our great motherland in industrial and agricultural production as well as cultural and educational construction. In order to meet the urgent needs of the socialist construction, cultural revolution, and technological revolution, and to satisfy the ardent desire of overseas Chinese students to enter institutions of higher learning, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference proposed, and the State Council approved, the establishment of a comprehensive university in Guangdong last autumn with the task of training overseas Chinese students. This university adopted the name "Jinan University." The pre-liberation Jinan University also focused on training overseas Chinese students, but in terms of educational policy and content, there is an essential difference between the old and new Jinan University.

In 1958, this new university opened five departments: Mining and Metallurgy, Aquatic Products, Navigation, Chinese Language, and History.

In addition, it also established a one-year preparatory course for overseas Chinese students and a two-year preparatory course for worker-peasant students. It is also responsible for the business guidance of the Guangzhou Returned Overseas Chinese Students' Remedial School. The undergraduate and preparatory courses currently have 1,276 students, with overseas Chinese students accounting for 65% of the total. The remaining students are mostly children of workers and peasants. The Overseas Chinese Remedial School currently has 737 students, all of whom are overseas Chinese.

Jinan University currently has more than 160 teachers, with the most support coming from Sun Yat-sen University. Hubei University and other brother schools and some other institutions have also provided support. The school has a collection of more than 200,000 books. Sun Yat-sen University, the Shanghai Cultural Bureau's library institutions, the Beijing Library, and Tongji University and other brother schools have enthusiastically supported it, donating more than 90,000 books in total. In addition, the funds are mainly allocated by the government, but also supported by people enthusiastic about overseas Chinese education.

Jinan University's overseas Chinese students and Hong Kong and Macao students grew up in capitalist countries or colonies, and were educated under capitalism or colonialism. Their lives and thoughts have certain characteristics. They do not have sufficient understanding of the corrupt nature of capitalism and the superiority of socialism, nor do they have sufficient understanding of the educational policies and policies of the motherland. Their cultural level also has a certain distance from domestic students due to the disparity in education at home and abroad. On the other hand, they are far away from the motherland, residing overseas. Seeing the prosperity of socialist construction in the motherland and the increasing international status, as well as the meticulous care for them, they love the motherland and the Communist Party. Although they do not fully understand the socialist content of the motherland, they have at least patriotism; their fathers and brothers are mostly overseas, and they have no home in the country, taking the school as their home, and also love the school; they are full of enthusiasm for work and a spirit of unity and friendship; after enlightenment, they can pursue progress and are unwilling to lag behind; they are also easy to accept new things; they can obey leadership, respect teachers, and their lives are diversified, lively, like sports, can sing and dance, and so on. We believe that overseas Chinese youth and domestic youth have common points such as loving the motherland, being more receptive to new things, etc., but overseas Chinese youth also have their own characteristics as mentioned above. The education problem of overseas Chinese students is how to implement the Party's education policy based on the policy of "treating overseas Chinese students equally and giving appropriate care."

In the short practice of nearly one year, Jinan University, based on the Party's education policy and the policy of working with overseas Chinese students, combined with the characteristics of overseas Chinese students, conducted socialist education on overseas Chinese students and gained some initial experiences. There are mainly the following three aspects:

1.  Combining the actual situation of overseas Chinese students, strengthen political and ideological education, and implement the Party's education policy.

As mentioned above, overseas Chinese students have been educated in bourgeois environments for a long time. The vast majority have not received socialist education, or the period of socialist education they have received is short and the influence is not deep. Therefore, many overseas Chinese students have more prominent bourgeois individualistic thoughts and styles. Therefore, there is a contradiction between their learning goals, their views on labor, and the Party's education policy. Many overseas Chinese students' motives for applying to institutions of higher learning are for fame and fortune, for finding a way out of life, or hoping to "stand out." This exposes the bourgeois concept of hierarchy. Many overseas Chinese students also have incorrect views on productive labor. Some believe that physical labor will damage their health or hinder their studies; some believe that physical labor is not commensurate with the status of students; some believe that going to the countryside to work cannot learn good qualities; some overseas Chinese students in liberal arts believe that going to the countryside to exercise has little to do with their major, so there are varying degrees of resistance. Some domestic students also have similar wrong views and dissatisfaction with productive labor.

The school Party committee and administration believe that correcting the students' learning attitude and their view of labor is the first problem that must be solved. The leadership firmly grasped this link and implemented the policy of "treating overseas Chinese students equally and giving appropriate care" in their education. At the beginning of the school year, taking the study of Chairman Mao's remarks on education and the Party's education policy as the guide, they carried out a great airing of views, a great debate, and unified the school's staff's educational ideas and methods, and also enabled overseas Chinese students to receive socialist education and correct their learning attitudes and methods. Subsequently, the school Party committee put forward the clear goals of "fighting for steel" and "training people in steelmaking," guiding overseas Chinese students and all students to participate in the rush to build a railway line dedicated to transporting steel, and to participate in the coking team. They also established a steel plant in the school and engaged in indigenous steelmaking to enthusiastically respond to the Party Central Committee's grand call to double steel production. After completing this political labor, the school Party committee and administration, combined with the characteristics of each major, arranged work in the countryside (History Department), factories (Mining and Metallurgy Department, Chinese Department), ships (Navigation Department), and fishing areas (Aquatic Products Department), and carried out on-site teaching and scientific research through labor training, laying the foundation for cultivating red and expert laborers. After a period of labor training this semester, they returned to school one after another. The school Party committee and administration, based on the principle of "consolidating and improving as the main task, and appropriately developing," took teaching as the center and comprehensively arranged school work. After fully mobilizing their thoughts and adjusting the teaching and learning organization, they focused on the teaching link, implemented the two "three combinations" teaching methods and the teaching principle of linking theory with practice, put politics in command, and launched teaching reforms to continuously improve teaching quality and learning efficiency.

In this series of measures, overseas Chinese students have been continuously cared for, encouraged, cultivated and educated by the school Party committee and administration, and their political and ideological awareness has been continuously improved. Their understanding of the Party's education policy has changed from doubt and resistance to gradually understanding and supporting it. Their confidence in the school and major has gradually established a correct learning attitude and professional thinking, and they have gone from superstitious about book knowledge to realizing the importance of linking theory with practice. Students who originally thought that physical labor was harmful to their health later revealed their experience, saying: "After labor training, my insomnia has been cured, and my physique has gradually improved." Overseas Chinese students from various departments and all teachers and students of the school also received great tests and training when building railway lines. A student from Hong Kong and Macao originally thought that porters had thick skin and coarse flesh, but changed this wrong view after building the railway line. The students of the Overseas Chinese Remedial School maintained discipline and organization in road construction, gave full play to the spirit of cooperation and soaring energy, and won the red flag award from the school Party committee and administration. Many overseas Chinese students believe that it is "the most valuable exercise." In the process of labor training, they learned a lot of vivid knowledge. For example, the Aquatic Products Department spent more than a month in the Beihai fishing area, and discovered many problems from the combination of professional production practice, and completed more than 100 research projects, such as the comprehensive utilization of puffer fish and the production of preservatives and activated carbon, which showed that to cultivate independent thinking ability, it is necessary to implement the principle of linking theory with practice, thereby overcoming the past tendency of theory being divorced from practice, and achieving certain results. Overseas Chinese students from the History Department reflected that they learned investigation and research and a lot of professional knowledge in the short period of time they were sent to the countryside, and they had a double harvest of ideology and business. Students who previously lacked confidence in the school and major no longer disliked their major after labor training and production practice, but loved their own major, and were more confident in the future of the school. They felt the working class's love of labor and selfless spirit in working with the workers, and initially established the ideological feelings of the working class.

Jinan University also conducted teaching and scientific research closely combined with labor training in the last semester. For example, teachers and students of the Mining and Metallurgy Department compiled a more complete textbook on Bessemer converter steelmaking with more than 100,000 words during their factory training; teachers and students of the freshwater and seawater aquaculture major of the Aquatic Products Department also wrote a variety of scientific research papers in the work and investigation of participating in the breeding farm; recently, the department also made achievements in the artificial incubation of silver carp, which is of great significance to fish farming. Teachers and students of the Chinese Department carried out productive labor in the school and went to Jiangcun to participate in coking at the coking plant, wrote many folk songs and papers, and compiled a collection of South China folk songs with rich content of "Lychee is full of mountains in a red," which has been published by the Writers Publishing House. Teachers and students of the History Department were sent to Panyu to participate in the People's Commune, wrote the Nanpu Investigation Report and the 240,000-word Panyu History. From the establishment of Jinan University to the end of December 1958, a total of 462 scientific research projects were completed in four months, including the project of the mathematics group making electronic computers.

This semester, focusing on the teaching link, implementing the two "three combinations" teaching methods, all students of the school, including overseas Chinese students, under the care and encouragement of the Party, went all out, gave full play to the collective strength of the learning organization on the basis of individual efforts, and improved the efficiency of learning. Under the leadership of the Party, teachers and students combined to conduct collective lesson preparation, and put forward opinions after class, put forward some correct views and other valuable opinions to help teachers improve teaching.

After the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Remedial School resolutely implemented the Party's education policy and implemented the overseas Chinese policy, correcting the past biases. Overseas Chinese students often participated in voluntary labor in nearby People's Communes and were praised. They were more actively involved in the torrent of national steelmaking related to the fate of the country, and fought for 10.7 million tons of steel. In this series of labor exercises, the socialist consciousness of overseas Chinese students has been greatly improved, their lives are simple, their studies are active, and their enthusiasm for labor is very high. Last year, overseas Chinese students who were assigned to study in middle schools across the country participated in almost 100% of the school's various labors, except for those who were sick; many overseas Chinese students performed very well and played an active leading role. They are also very active in learning and various social activities; they have become the backbone of various schools, and the schools are satisfied with the progress of overseas Chinese students.

From this we can see that as long as we strengthen political and ideological education and resolutely implement the Party's education policy, we can quickly improve the political and ideological level of overseas Chinese students and mobilize their enthusiasm, so that they can study hard for the socialist construction of the motherland.

2.  Start from perceptual knowledge and raise it to rational knowledge to educate overseas Chinese students.

According to the characteristics of overseas Chinese students who love the motherland, are easy to accept new things, and are attracted by the vigorous atmosphere of socialist construction in the motherland and return to China to study, through visits, interviews, heart-to-heart talks, or holding exhibitions, inviting heroes of the People's Liberation Army and other aspects to make reports, etc., using mass self-education, conducting symposiums and debates, and transforming perceptual knowledge into rational knowledge, helping them to continuously improve their political and ideological level is also one of the effective methods of educating overseas Chinese students.

In the first semester of 1958, overseas Chinese students from various departments of Jinan University, together with teachers and domestic students, went to the countryside, factories, ships, and fishing areas to engage in productive labor in conjunction with their majors. They saw with their own eyes the brilliant achievements of industry and agricultural production in the motherland during the Great Leap Forward, the great progress of the People's Commune movement, the remarkable achievements made in implementing the Party's education policy, and the many new people and new things they saw in the countryside and factories, as well as the new look of the fishing village, and they were moved. Therefore, they loved the Party and the motherland more, loved the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union more, and cared more about the international communist movement and the national liberation movement. They enthusiastically participated in demonstrations in support of the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and cheered for the Soviet cosmic rocket going to the sky after three earth satellites, and the spirit of patriotism and internationalism gradually developed.

Recently, the Overseas Chinese Remedial School organized 60 new overseas Chinese students who had just returned from overseas to visit the People's Commune, sugarcane chemical factory, and various industrial and agricultural socialist construction in Jiangmen City and Xinhui County, and listened to the reports of the responsible comrades of Xinhui County and Jiangmen City. They saw with their own eyes the face of the motherland's Great Leap Forward, the new life and new social relations of the members of the People's Commune, and heard firsthand the true and vivid reports of the leaders, which solved some of their doubts before returning to China and shattered the enemy's shameless and malicious propaganda, and gained a lot. They said: "After the visit, it is better than reading books for ten years. In the past, I did not completely believe the rumors overseas, but I could not convince others. Now I have a way"; "The iron facts are in front of me, my mind has changed, and my doubts have been resolved"; "This visit was a rich and vivid political lesson, and the impression was very deep"; "From the visit, I learned to look at problems comprehensively, and to specifically analyze problems by comparing ten fingers with one finger or half a finger." After this visit, their doubts were dispelled, they felt comfortable, their political and ideological awareness was improved, and their enthusiasm for learning was also very high.

3.  Resolutely implement the Party's overseas Chinese policy, "treat overseas Chinese students equally," and also "give appropriate care."

After returning to China, overseas Chinese students generally do not want to accept special care for them, and we should not create special figures for them. As mentioned above, Jinan University has achieved success in giving overseas Chinese students a free hand in exercise, strengthening education, and this shows the correctness of the "equal treatment" policy, but we should not grasp the "equal treatment" side and ignore the "appropriate care" side. Because overseas Chinese students have just moved from a capitalist environment to a socialist university for socialist construction, and because overseas Chinese students and domestic students are actually different, their families are overseas and have overseas remittances; their living habits are also different, they like cultural and sports activities and are more active. This is a small difference in the big picture; moreover, because their ideological development laws are different and their levels of awareness are inconsistent, they still need to be given appropriate care in political thought for a certain period of time to solve their difficulties in life and learning. The education of overseas Chinese students is also done by grasping both ends and bringing the middle along. However, more encouragement, persuasion, and education should be carried out. Appropriate criticism should be given for their wrong thoughts or actions, but they should not be rushed, and they should be patiently guided to gradually improve their political and ideological awareness. When their awareness is improved, they will demand their own continuous progress. However, they have not been tested and their persistence is poor, so their progress must continue to be consolidated. If they make progress in their thinking, learning, and life, they should be encouraged and praised in a timely manner to mobilize their positive factors. For individual overseas Chinese students who are worse, a serious attitude should be adopted, patient and meticulous education should be carried out, and they should be dealt with in accordance with the specific situation.

In order to adapt to the habits of overseas Chinese students who are active and like cultural and sports activities, more beneficial cultural and sports activities should be organized. Education should be carried out on overseas Chinese students through these activities to make their spirits happy and their minds open. For some overseas Chinese students with a higher level of awareness and the ability to work, they should be selected to take on social work to strengthen their sense of responsibility and exercise and improve in work practice.

In addition, we should warmly receive overseas Chinese students, care for them politically, ideologically, academically, and in life, and establish a new type of teacher-student relationship that is equal, democratic, and mutually caring. In this way, they will get closer to the teachers, dare to tell their inner thoughts, talk about thoughts, and talk about problems, which makes it easy to carry out education. It also makes overseas Chinese students feel warm and regard the school as their home, thus loving the school and the motherland more.

We believe that as long as we resolutely implement the overseas Chinese policy of treating everyone equally and giving appropriate care, give overseas Chinese students a free hand in exercise, strengthen education, and give them the necessary care. Do not let them go their own way, do not underestimate their active role, combine their characteristics, give appropriate care, be good at enlightening and educating them, patiently guide them, transform negative factors into positive factors, and continuously improve their political and ideological awareness, then it is entirely possible to train overseas Chinese students into workers with socialist awareness, specialized knowledge and skills, and healthy physique.

In order to train more and better socialist construction talents for the motherland, in order to further meet the urgent need of more and more overseas Chinese students to enter institutions of higher learning, Jinan University will add four departments of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and economics in 1959, six majors of mathematics, physics, chemistry, finance and trade, foreign trade, and industrial economics, and add the Department of Oriental Languages ​​and Literature in 1960. In terms of scientific research, Jinan University will cooperate with the Guangdong Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to establish the Southeast Asia Research Institute and the Marine Research Institute to conduct scientific research on the history, culture, political economy and other aspects of Southeast Asia, as well as marine issues. Each department will consider establishing a number of research offices as bases for scientific research.

Jinan University was founded not long ago. Teachers in various departments need to be enriched; basic construction is still in progress; basic construction materials need to be supplied; books and instruments need to be supplemented; and many other works need to be improved. It is hoped that under the leadership of the Party and the government, we can continue to receive strong support from brother schools and other units, as well as the continued care and support of the vast number of overseas Chinese and people from all walks of life. Our education work for overseas Chinese students has just begun and we still lack experience. We put forward these superficial experiences and sincerely hope for criticism and corrections so that our future work can be carried out smoothly.

Because overseas Chinese students have families overseas and have close ties with overseas Chinese, the education of overseas Chinese students not only educates them and trains them to become cultural workers with socialist awareness, contributing their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland. And through them, it will affect the vast number of overseas Chinese. Therefore, the education of overseas Chinese students is an extremely important and serious task. We will work with domestic overseas Chinese education workers, under the leadership of the Party and the government, to do our best to further implement the Party's education policy, implement the central government's education policy for overseas Chinese students, and strive to do a good job in the education of overseas Chinese students!

专栏：

    归侨学生的高等教育问题
    王越委员的发言主席团、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、李维汉副主席、彭真副委员长的报告。
    现在我想就侨生的高等教育问题谈一谈，并涉及部分侨生的补习教育。
    我国华侨众多，分布在世界各地，数达一千二百万人以上，尤其是广东、福建两省，濒临大海，交通发达，远涉重洋，到海外谋生的华侨，为数甚巨。
    解放以来，在党和政府英明正确的领导下，社会主义的建设事业，一日千里；祖国在国际上的地位，大大提高。这种欣欣向荣的气象，吸引着广大的海外侨胞；更由于党和祖国对侨胞们无微不至的关怀，使他们更感到祖国的无限温暖，绝大多数的海外侨胞与住在港、澳地区的同胞，都愿意遣送他们的子弟，回到祖国来，接受党和祖国的教育。
    一九五八年是我们伟大祖国在工、农业生产上以及文教建设上大跃进的一年。为了适应祖国社会主义建设以及文化革命和技术革命的迫切需要，为了满足侨生考升高等学校的热烈要求，经中共广东省委员会、广东省人民委员会及中国人民政治协商会议广东省委员会的倡议，国务院批准，去年秋天在广东成立一所负有培养侨生任务的综合大学，这所大学沿用了“暨南大学”的校名。解放前的暨南大学也是以培养侨生为主，但从教育方针及教育内容来看，新旧暨南大学是有本质上的区别的。
    这所新大学在一九五八年度开设了矿冶、水产、航海、中文和历史五个系。
    此外，还办了一年制的华侨学生预科和二年制的工农学生预科，对广州归国华侨学生补习学校，在业务上，也负有领导的责任。本科和预科现有学生一千二百七十六人，侨生占总人数百分之六十五，其余同学，多属工农子弟，华侨补校现有学生七百三十七人，全属侨生。
    暨大现有教师一百六十多人，中山大学支援最多，湖北大学等兄弟学校及其他一些机构也予以支援。学校藏书二十多万册，中山大学、上海文化局所属图书机构、北京图书馆以及同济大学等兄弟学校热烈支持，共赠送了九万多册书籍。此外，经费方面主要是由政府拨给，但也得到热心华侨教育的人士的支持。
    暨大侨生和港澳生生长在资本主义国家或殖民地，受资本主义或殖民地的教育，他们的生活及思想情况有其一定的特点，他们对资本主义的腐朽本质与社会主义的优越性认识不足，对祖国的教育方针和政策也没有足够的认识；他们的文化程度，由于国内外教育的悬殊，也和国内同学有一定的距离。另一方面，他们远离祖国，侨居海外，看到祖国社会主义建设欣欣向荣，国际地位日益提高，以及对他们无微不至的关怀，因而热爱祖国，热爱共产党。他们虽对祖国的社会主义内容不大了解，却有着起码的爱国主义精神；他们的父兄多在海外，国内无家，以校为家，也热爱学校；富有工作热情和团结友爱的精神；经过启发，能够追求进步，不甘落后；对新事物也容易接受；能服从领导，尊敬老师，以及生活多样化，生动活泼，喜欢运动，能歌善舞等等。我们认为华侨青年与国内青年有其共同之点如热爱祖国，较易接受新事物等，但华侨青年亦有其如上面所举的特点。对侨生的教育问题，是如何根据对侨生“一视同仁，适当照顾”的政策，来贯彻党的教育方针问题。
    在将近一年的短短的实践过程中，暨大依据党的教育方针与对侨生工作的政策，结合侨生的特点，对侨生进行社会主义教育，获得了一些初步体会。主要有下列三方面：
    一、结合侨生的实际，加强政治思想教育，贯彻党的教育方针。
    正如上面所述，侨生在海外长期受资产阶级的教育，绝大部分没有受过社会主义的教育，或者受过社会主义教育，为期尚短，熏陶不深，因此，许多侨生资产阶级个人主义的思想作风较为突出，因而他们的学习目的、对劳动的看法和党的教育方针存在着矛盾。不少侨生投考高等学校的动机，是为了名利，为了找生活出路，或希望能够“出人头地”。这里就暴露了资产阶级的等级观念。许多侨生对生产劳动也有着不正确的看法，有的认为体力劳动会损害健康或会妨碍学习；有的认为体力劳动和学生的身分不相称，有的以为下乡劳动学不到优良品质；文科的一些侨生认为下乡锻炼和专业没有多大关系，因而存在着不同程度的抵触情绪。有些国内同学，对生产劳动也有类似的错误看法与不满情绪。
    学校党委和行政认为端正同学们的学习态度和对劳动的看法，是必须首先解决的问题。领导方面紧紧抓住了这一环，并贯彻对侨生教育的“一视同仁，适当照顾”的方针，在开学的初期，以学习毛主席关于教育工作的言论和党的教育方针为纲，大鸣大放，大争大辩，统一了全校员工的办学思想与办学方法，也使侨生受到了社会主义的教育，端正了学习态度和学习方法。接着，学校党委提出：“为钢铁而战”，“在炼钢中炼人”的明确目标，引导侨生和全校学生一起，参加了抢修为运输钢铁专用的铁路线，并参加了炼焦团，在学校里又建立钢厂，并搞土法炼钢，以实际的行动，热烈响应党中央的钢铁翻一番的宏伟号召。在完成了这项政治性的劳动之后，学校党委和行政，又结合各专业的特点，安排下乡（历史系）、下厂（矿冶系、中文系）、下船（航海系）、下渔区（水产系）的工作，并通过劳动锻炼，进行现场教学和科学研究，为培养又红又专的劳动者打下基础。这学期他们经过了一段时期劳动锻炼之后，又相继回校，学校党委和行政，本着“巩固提高为主、适当发展”的原则，以教学为中心，全面安排学校工作，并在思想充分动员与调整教学和学习组织之后，即大抓教学这一环节，贯彻两个“三结合”的教学方法与理论联系实际的教学原则，政治挂帅，展开教学改革，为不断提高教学质量与学习效率而努力。
    在这一系列的措施中，侨生得到学校党委和行政的不断关怀、鼓舞、培养和教育，政治思想觉悟不断地提高，他们对党的教育方针从怀疑、抗拒到逐渐认识和拥护，对学校和专业由缺乏信心而逐渐树立正确的学习态度与专业思想，从迷信书本知识到体会理论联系实际的重要性。原来认为体力劳动有害于身体健康的同学，后来却道出自己的体验说：“经劳动锻炼之后，治好我的失眠症，我的体质也日渐好转。”各系侨生和全校师生一起，在修筑铁路专线的时候，也受到很大的考验和锻炼。一位港澳学生，原来认为搬运工人皮厚肉粗，在修铁路专线后，改变了这种错误的看法。华侨补校的同学们，在筑路中守纪律、有组织，充分发挥协作的精神与冲天干劲，获得学校党委与行政的红旗奖。不少侨生认为是：“最难得的锻炼”。他们在劳动锻炼的过程中，学到了不少活生生的知识，例如水产系在下放北海渔区一个多月的时间，从结合专业的生产实践中，发现了许多问题，完成了一百多项研究工作，如河豚的综合利用与防腐剂和活性碳的制出，显示出要培养独立思考能力就必须贯彻理论联系实际这条原则，从而克服了过去理论脱离实际的偏向，收到一定的效果。历史系的侨生反映，在下放的短短期间内，学会了调查研究和很多业务的知识，思想业务两丰收。从前对学校和专业缺乏信心的同学，经过了劳动锻炼与生产实践之后，不再厌恶专业而是爱好他们自己的专业了，对于学校的前途，也较有信心了。他们在与工人一起工作中，体会到工人阶级热爱劳动、大公无私的精神，初步建立起工人阶级的思想感情。
    暨大在上学期紧紧结合劳动锻炼，也进行了教学和科学研究。例如矿冶系师生，在工厂锻炼中，编出了十万多字比较完整的贝氏转炉炼钢教材；水产系淡海水养殖专业师生，在参加养殖场工作与调查研究中，也写出多种科学研究论文来；最近该系又在鲢鱼的人工孵化方面，做出成绩，这对于鱼类养殖有重大的意义。中文系师生，在校里进行生产劳动和到江村去参加炼焦厂炼焦，写出了不少民歌与论文，编出了“荔枝满山一片红”的内容丰富的华南民歌选集，已由作家出版社出版。历史系师生下放到番禺参加人民公社，写出了南浦调查报告和二十四万字的番禺史志。暨大自建校以来至一九五八年十二月底，四个月中，共完成科学研究达四百六十二项，包括数学组制成电子计算机等项目。
    这学期抓紧教学这一环节，贯彻两个“三结合”的教学方法中，全校同学包括侨生在内，在党的关怀和鼓舞下，鼓足干劲，在个人努力学习的基础上，发挥学习组织的集体力量，提高了学习的效率。他们在党的领导、教师、学生三结合中，进行集体备课，并在课后提意见，提出了一些正确的观点与其他宝贵的意见，帮助老师改进教学。
    广州华侨补校，经过反右派斗争和整风运动之后，坚决贯彻党的教育方针和执行华侨政策，纠正了过去的偏向。侨生们经常到附近人民公社参加义务劳动，受到了表扬。他们更积极投身于关系到国家命运的全民炼钢的洪流里，为一千零七十万吨钢铁而奋斗。在这一系列的劳动锻炼中，侨生们的社会主义觉悟大大提高，生活朴素，学习积极，劳动的干劲很大。去年分配到全国各中学学习的侨生，在学校的各项劳动中，除病号外，几乎是百分之百地参加；好些侨生表现得很出色，起了积极的带头作用。他们在学习和各项社会活动中，也表现得很积极；他们已成为各校的骨干力量，各校对侨生的进步感到满意。
    由此我们可以看出，只要加强政治思想教育，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，就能够迅速提高侨生的政治思想水平，调动他们的积极性；使他们为祖国社会主义建设事业而努力学习。
    二、从感性认识入手，提高到理性认识，对侨生进行教育。
    根据侨生热爱祖国，易于接受新鲜事物，被祖国社会主义建设的蓬勃气象所吸引而归国升学的特点，通过参观、访问、谈心或举行展览会，请解放军及其他方面的英雄人物作报告等活动，利用群众自我教育，进行座谈辩论，通过感性认识，提高到理性认识，帮助他们不断提高政治思想水平，也是教育侨生的有效方法之一。
    一九五八年度上学期，暨大各系侨生，和老师及国内同学一起，下乡、下厂、下船、下渔区，结合专业从事生产劳动。他们亲眼看到祖国在大跃进中工、农业生产的辉煌成就，人民公社运动的巨大进展，贯彻党的教育方针所取得的显著成就，和他们在农村和工厂里，看到不少的新人新事，以及渔村的新面貌，感动万分。因而就更加热爱党和祖国，更热爱以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，更加关心国际共产主义运动和民族解放运动，他们热情参加支持亚非地区和拉丁美洲民族解放运动的示威游行，欢呼苏联宇宙火箭继三个地球卫星之后上了天，爱国主义与国际主义的精神，逐步培养起来。
    最近，华侨补校组织新从海外回国的侨生六十人，到江门市和新会县参观人民公社、甘蔗化工厂，以及各项工、农业的社会主义建设，和听了新会县及江门市负责同志的报告，他们亲眼看到祖国大跃进的面貌，人民公社社员们新的生活，新的社会关系，亲耳听到首长们千真万确的生动的报告，解决了他们在归国前的一些怀疑，和粉碎了敌人的无耻的恶意宣传，收获很大。他们说：“参观以后，胜读十年书。过去海外的谣言自己虽不完全相信，但不能说服别人，现在有办法了”；“铁的事实摆在我的面前，我的脑筋转了，我的怀疑解决了”；“这次参观，是一堂丰富的、生动的政治课，印象很深”；“从参观中学会了全面看问题，要从十个指头与一个指头或半个指头对比来具体分析问题”。经过这次参观，他们的怀疑冰释，心情舒畅，政治思想觉悟有了提高，学习的劲头也很大。
    三、坚决贯彻党的华侨政策，对侨生“一视同仁”，也必须“适当照顾”。
    侨生回国以后，一般上不愿意接受对他们的特殊照顾，我们也不应当给他们造成特殊的人物。正如上面所述，十个月来，对侨生放手锻炼，加强教育，暨大收到了成效，说明了“一视同仁”的政策的正确性，但也不应抓住了“一视同仁”的一面，就忽略了“适当照顾”的一面。因为侨生刚从资本主义环境转到社会主义建设的社会主义大学来，由于侨生和国内学生事实上有所不同，他们家人在海外，有侨汇；生活习惯上也有所不同，喜欢文体活动，比较好动些，这是大同中的小异；更由于他们的思想发展规律不同，觉悟程度也不一致，因之还须在一定期间在政治思想上给他们以适当的照顾，解决他们生活上和学习上的困难。对侨生的教育，同样是用抓两头带中间的方法。但应多进行启发、说服、教育，对他们错误的思想或行动，须进行适当的批评，但不能操之过急，应耐心地引导他们的政治思想觉悟逐步提高。觉悟提高了，他们就会要求自己不断进步。但他们还没有经过考验，持久性较差，必须继续巩固其进步。他们在思想上、学习上和生活上如有所进步，应及时予以鼓励和表扬，以调动他们的积极因素。对个别比较坏些的侨生，则应采取严肃的态度，进行耐心细致的教育，并针对具体情况予以处理。
    为了适应侨生个性好动和喜欢文体活动的习惯，要多组织有益的文体活动。通过这些活动，对侨生进行教育，使他们的精神愉快，心境开朗。对一些觉悟程度较高和有工作能力的侨生，应选拔他出来担任社会工作，以加强他们的责任感，并在工作实践中锻炼和提高。
    此外，我们应热情地接待侨生，从政治思想上、学习上、生活上去关怀他们，和他们建立平等的、民主的、互相关怀的新型的师生关系。这样，他们就会和老师接近起来，敢于倾诉自己的心里话，谈思想，谈问题，容易进行教育。也使侨生感到温暖，视校如家，从而更热爱学校、热爱祖国。
    我们认为：只要坚决贯彻一视同仁，适当照顾的华侨政策，对侨生放手锻炼，加强教育，予以必要的照顾。不要让他们放任自流，不要低估他们的积极作用，结合他们的特点，适当照顾，善于对他们进行启发、教育，耐心诱导，化消极因素为积极因素，不断提高他们的政治思想觉悟，那么要把侨生培养为有社会主义觉悟的有专门知识技能的体格健康的劳动者，那是完全可能的。
    为了为祖国培养更多更好的社会主义建设人才，为了进一步满足越来越多的侨生考进高等学校学习的迫切需要，暨大将于一九五九年度增设数学、物理、化学、经济四个系，数学、物理、化学、财贸、外贸、工业经济等六个专业，并于一九六○年度，增设东方语言文学系。在科学研究方面，暨大将与科学院广东分院协作，成立东南亚研究所和海洋研究所，进行对东南亚的历史、文化、政治经济等方面以及有关海洋问题的科学研究，各系将考虑成立若干研究室，作为科学研究的据点。
    暨大创办不久，各系师资，有待充实；基本建设，尚在进行，基建材料，有待供应；图书仪器，有待补充；其他许多工作，尚须改进，希望在党和政府领导之下，能够继续得到各兄弟学校和其他单位的大力支援，以及广大海外侨胞与社会人士的继续关怀和支持。我们对侨生的教育工作刚刚开个头，还缺少经验。我们把这些粗浅的体会提出来，衷心地希望批评和指正，使我们今后的工作，能够顺利地开展。
    由于侨生家在海外，和海外侨胞有着密切的联系，对侨生的教育工作，不但教育其本人，培养他们成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者，为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献出力量。而且将通过他们，影响广大海外侨胞。因此，对侨生的教育，是一件极端重要的严肃的工作，我们将和国内侨教工作者一起，在党和政府的领导下，尽我们的力量，为进一步贯彻党的教育方针，贯彻中央对侨生的教育政策，为办好对侨生的教育工作而奋斗！
