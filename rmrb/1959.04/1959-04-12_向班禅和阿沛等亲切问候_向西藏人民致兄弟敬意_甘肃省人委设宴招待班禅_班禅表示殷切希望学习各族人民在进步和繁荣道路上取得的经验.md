Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, April 11th: The Gansu Provincial People's Committee hosted a banquet at noon today in honor of Panchen Erdeni, a representative of the National People's Congress and Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

Also invited to attend the banquet were Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, a representative of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region; Jamyang Jigme and Sherab Dhendup, representatives of the National People's Congress; Ngapoi Tseten Drolkar, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; officials accompanying Panchen Erdeni; and Liang Xuanxian, Secretary of the CPC Xigaze Sub-district Committee, who accompanied Panchen Erdeni to Beijing.

Among those attending the banquet were Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee; Deng Baoshan, Governor of Gansu Province; Lieutenant General Xian Henghan, Commander of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lanzhou; and Vice Governors Huang Zhengqing and Ma Qingnian.

In his speech, Gansu Governor Deng Baoshan, on behalf of the Gansu Provincial People's Committee and the people of all ethnic groups in Gansu, extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to Panchen Erdeni, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and all accompanying officials, and expressed brotherly respect to the people of Tibet. He said that the people of all ethnic groups in Gansu, like the people of the whole country, sincerely congratulate Tibet on opening a new page in its history and congratulate the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region on the complete success of its first plenary session in exercising the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet. We express a warm welcome and support for the efforts made by Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni to safeguard the unification of the motherland and strengthen ethnic unity, and for the patriotic stance of Vice Chairman Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme.

Panchen Erdeni spoke at the banquet, thanking the people of all ethnic groups in Gansu for their strong support to the people of Tibet. He said that on this trip to the capital, I was thinking in my heart about the loveliness of our great motherland, and that the brave and industrious people of all ethnic groups, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction, are leaping forward to a happy life at a speed equal to twenty years in one day. The brilliant victories achieved today on all fronts of the motherland and the happy life enjoyed by the people of all ethnic groups have fully demonstrated the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. He said that during my visit to Lanzhou, I personally saw the vigorous development and construction here, and compared with Lanzhou, which I visited in 1955, a brand-new change has taken place. The new Lanzhou is full of the vigor of the Great Leap Forward everywhere. He said that now the people of Tibet and patriotic people are more closely united around the Party, and together with the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, are working hard to resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion, maintain peaceful order, defend the unification of the motherland, carry out reforms at an early date, and resolutely take the socialist road. We sincerely hope to learn from the valuable experiences gained by all ethnic groups in the country on the road to progress and prosperity, so as to successfully complete the task of building a new Tibet under the leadership of the central government and with the support of all ethnic groups in the country.

During the banquet, Panchen Erdeni raised his glass and proposed a toast to the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country and to the health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups.

The banquet was filled with an atmosphere of unity and joy.

This morning, Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, visited Panchen Erdeni, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Jamyang Jigme, and had cordial conversations with them.
