　　Seven-Function Desk Clock
    The commonly used desk clock (also known as an alarm clock) can only display hours, minutes, seconds, and set a time for the alarm to ring. Now, the Beijing Clock Factory has successfully trial-produced a seven-function desk clock, which can not only measure hours, minutes, and seconds, and set a time for the alarm to ring, but also measure months, days, and days of the week.
