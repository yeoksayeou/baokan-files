In Front of the Health Center
    Shu Fan

Since the health center was established at the foot of these snow-capped mountains, it's been almost three months. The open space in front of the gate has always been my responsibility to sweep. But these past few days, a strange thing has happened – whenever I go out with my broom, the ground is always clean.

Once or twice is nothing, but after three mornings in a row, I couldn't stand it anymore. At mealtime, after portioning out the food, I stood in the courtyard and said, "Comrades, listen while you eat, from now on, no one is allowed to sweep the floor for me!"

Everyone looked at each other.

I continued, "Aren't you comrades tired enough? Outpatient visits, house calls, taking care of hospitalized patients, plus carrying firewood, gathering grass, and planting vegetables. It's a revolutionary division of labor. Chores are handled by us in the cooking班. You cure the Tibetan villagers of their illnesses, and I'll be..."

"Alright! Just eat your food," interrupted Director Li. "Even if someone did sweep the floor for you, what's the big deal?"

That night, I simply didn't sleep. I stayed up with the nurse on duty in the emergency room, rolling cotton balls, keeping an eye on the road to the gate, determined to see who it was!

Sure enough, my "mobilization report" had some effect; nothing happened all night.

As dawn broke, the deep horns of the lamasery sounded for morning prayers. I picked up my pine branch broom, opened the gate, and almost tripped – a fat, big roe deer was lying across the entrance. Upon closer inspection, it had been shot with a firearm. And the ground had been swept clean again.

This was no longer a "personal matter" for me. Who was helping the health center sweep the floor? Who was secretly sending this gift? Director Li assigned me the task of finding out.

The task wasn't difficult. I moved my "observation post" to the gate, wrapped myself in an old sheepskin coat, and dozed against the doorframe. Around the fourth watch [2-4am], I heard the rustling sound of sweeping.

I shone my flashlight, and a figure ran away from me. But I caught up with three quick steps, and when I grabbed them and looked, oh! Wasn't it Auntie Chezha Ma?

Auntie Chezha Ma was in her fifties, living in the village below the lamasery, an elderly orphaned couple with no children. Their family had been "Geba" of the noble manor for generations. "Geba," translated into Han Chinese, means serf.

Chezha Ma's husband, Luosang, made a careless remark that offended the manor's steward and was struck with a waist knife. The steward also threatened him, forbidding him from coming to the health center for treatment, because that guy knew that the people sent by Chairman Mao were against harming the people.

Xiao Wang found out about this that very day. Xiao Wang, being a young woman, went house to house and was familiar with everyone. Despite Auntie Chezha Ma's reservations, saving a life was paramount, and we carried Luosang here.

Director Li personally gave emergency treatment, injecting tetanus antitoxin and penicillin. Old Luosang had lost too much blood, and the comrades in our hospital donated their own blood, finally pulling him through the danger. Now, Old Luosang is recovering at home.

The old couple said many words of gratitude. But what was there to it? This was our duty. Chairman Mao sent us here to guarantee the health of the villagers!

But Auntie Chezha Ma never forgot this...

I said, "Auntie, you're..."

Auntie grabbed my hand, "You don't want to accept gifts, and I can't afford to give any gifts, but if I don't do something, I just feel..."

"Don't do this, Auntie, never again..."

Auntie shook her head repeatedly, not answering my words.

My "reconnaissance" mission was only half completed; the person who sent the roe deer was never found. Luosang's injury hadn't healed yet, and besides, his family didn't have a hunting rifle.

Who was it? Maybe it was Zhaxi, maybe it was Daojie, maybe it was Baima Dengzhu's son Pengduo, or maybe it was the families on the pasture who had seen a doctor. Anyway, people giving gifts to the hospital were there every day. We refused what we could refuse, and had to accept what we couldn't, otherwise the villagers would get angry. Now this anonymous method had come up.

Some comrades suggested organizing a small group to take turns on night duty to "deal with" the secret gift-giving. The Party branch didn't adopt this suggestion. Director Li – our Party branch secretary – said, "The people give us love, we can only repay it with love, let's devote all our energy to our work!"

### 卫生院的门前

    卫生院的门前
    舒凡
    自从卫生院在这雪山脚下建立，快三个月了，大门口的空场一向归我打扫。这几天却出了怪事——每当我掂着扫帚出去，地总是干干净净的。
    一次两次不打紧，接连三个早晨，实在耐不住了。开饭时，我把菜分好，就站在当院心说：“同志们，一边吃一边听着，从今以后，谁也不准替我扫地！”
    大家你看看我，我看看你。
    我接着说：“同志们还不够累的吗？门诊、出诊，照顾住院病人，外搭背柴、拾草、种菜。革命分工嘛，杂务事包给我们炊事班，你们给藏族老乡把病治好，我心里就……”
      “行啦！快吃你的饭吧。”李院长打断了我的话：“就算谁帮你扫了地，又有什么大不了的？”
    这夜晚我干脆不睡觉，跟急诊室值班护士一道搓棉花球，眼睛留神着通大门口的路，倒要看看你是谁！
    真不坏，我的“动员报告”还是起了作用，一宵无事。
    天擦亮了，喇嘛寺早祷的大号呜呜地响起，我拿起松枝扫帚，拉开大门，差点绊了一个跟斗——一只又肥又大的獐子横在门口，细察看，是火枪打死的。而地，又已扫得干干净净。
    这就不是我的“个人问题”了。是谁帮助卫生院扫了地呢？是谁悄悄送来这份礼物呢？李院长指定我负责把这件事搞清楚。
    任务不难，我把“观察所”推进到大门口，身上裹了件老羊皮大衣，依着门框打盹。约摸四更时分，就听见沙沙的扫地声。
    我把电筒一亮，一个人影背着我跑开。可是被我三脚两步就撵上了，拉住一看，哟！这不是彻扎玛大娘吗？
    彻扎玛大娘五十多岁了，住在喇嘛庙底下的村子里，一对孤老夫妻，没儿没女。她们家世代是贵族庄园的“格巴”，“格巴”翻成汉话，就是农奴的意思。
    彻扎玛的老伴罗桑两句不打紧的话，冒犯了庄园上的管家，挨了一腰刀。管家还威吓他，不准到卫生院来治，因为那家伙懂得，毛主席派来的人，是反对残害人民的。
    这事当天就让小王知道了，小王这姑娘家家串，谁都跟她熟。尽管彻扎玛大娘有顾虑，救人要紧，我们还是把罗桑抬了来。
    李院长亲自急救，注射了破伤风抗毒素和青霉素。老罗桑流血过多，我们医院的同志输出了自己的血，终算把危险顶住了，现在，老罗桑正在家里养伤。
    老两口说了不少感激的话。可这有啥呢？这是我们分内的事，毛主席派我们来，就是为了保证老乡们的健康嘛！
    可彻扎玛大娘，老也不忘这件事……。
    我说：“大娘，你这是……”
    大娘拉住我的手：“你们不愿意收礼物，我也送不起啥礼物，可我要不做点什么，心里总觉着……”
      “不要这样，大娘，往后绝不要……”
    大娘连连摇头，不回答我的话。
    我的“侦察”任务只完成了一半，送獐子的人到头也没找见。罗桑伤还没好，再说他家也没有猎枪。
    是谁呢？也许是扎西，也许是刀杰，也许是白马登珠的儿子彭朵，还兴许是牧场上那些看过病的人家。反正，给医院送礼的人天天都有，能拒绝的拒绝了，拒绝不了的就得收下，要不然老乡就生气。如今又来了这种不照面的办法。
    有的同志提议，组织那么个小组，轮流值夜，来“应付”暗中送礼的。党支部没有采纳这个建议，李院长——我们的支部书记说：“群众给我们爱，只有用爱来还，把我们的精力全部用到工作上去罢！”
