　　Saying "Compare"
　　Huang Gan
　　"Ten fingers are of different lengths," and the development process of any matter is unbalanced. In mass movements, there are also differences between the advanced and the backward. This is the objective basis for the socialist red flag emulation campaign of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, which is vigorously unfolding on the industrial front.
　　To compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced, we must first start with comparison. The reasoning is very simple: to catch up with the advanced, we must first learn from the advanced, and to learn from the advanced, we must first clarify the direction of learning. Comparing means promoting advanced things to point out the direction for backward phenomena to move forward. As the saying goes, "You are not afraid of not knowing the goods, but only afraid of comparing goods with goods." Without comparison, the contradiction between the advanced and the backward is not easily perceived by people; once compared, who is advanced and who is backward becomes clear at a glance. Through comparison, we can not only establish advanced banners, stimulate and encourage the vast number of workers to strive for progress and catch up quickly, and prompt the advanced to work harder and strive to be more advanced; but also facilitate the discovery and summarization of advanced experiences, and guide people to the specific road forward.
　　The significance and role of comparison are very obvious. The question is how to compare.
　　We say that there are three ways to compare. First, the comparison must be comprehensive. There is no such thing as perfection in the world. The so-called advanced and backward are also relative. In actual production activities, the differences between advanced and backward are often intricate and complex, with backwardness in the advanced and advancement in the backward. Advanced units cannot be "flawless," and backward units are not necessarily without merit. People often see such examples in daily life. Therefore, wherever there are differences between advanced and backward, we must compare there. Whoever has a skill in a certain aspect, everyone must learn from his strength. Only in this way can our competition truly reflect the principles of mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses, and common improvement, and through comparison, achieve mutual promotion and common leap forward.
　　Second, the comparison must be deep. Comparison is only a means. The purpose is to establish opposites, expose contradictions, take measures, resolve contradictions, and promote the continuous progress of the movement. Therefore, it is important to look through the phenomena and compare the essence, that is, not only to compare who is advanced and who is backward, where the advanced is, and in which aspects the backward is, but also to compare the reasons for the advanced and backward. This means that we must vigorously develop advanced thinking through comparison, seize the opportunity to summarize and promote advanced experiences, and at the same time, warmly help the backward, and promote the backward to study hard and catch up with the advanced.
　　Third, the comparison must be continuous. Advanced and backward are objective existences. In the production movement, it always starts with a few advanced people and advanced units leading the way. When the general people and general units catch up with the few advanced people and advanced units, new advanced people and advanced units will inevitably appear, thus forming new differences between advanced and backward. It can be seen that new differences are constantly replacing old differences, and the changes in the differences themselves are endless. At the same time, advanced and backward are relative. Sometimes this group of people and this group of units are in the lead, and sometimes another group of people and another group of units are in the lead. Therefore, in the competition, we must not only compare year after year and season after season, but also month after month, ten days after ten days, and even day after day, and at all times. Only by comparing diligently can we spur the backward to work harder and catch up, so that the advanced have no time to be proud and go further on the road to advancement, thereby promoting production to surge one wave after another, one wave higher than another.
　　Socialist competition is a revolutionary friendship competition. Therefore, in the competition, we must promote the spirit of communist cooperation and advocate mutual learning and mutual assistance. The advanced must have the spirit of tireless teaching and selflessly teach their experiences to others. The backward must have the enthusiasm to strive for progress and actively learn from and catch up with the advanced.

### 说“比”

　　说“比”
　　黄淦
    “十个指头有长短”，任何事物的发展过程都是不平衡的。在群众运动中，也存在先进与落后的差别。这是目前工业战线上正在蓬勃开展的比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义红旗竞赛运动的客观基础。
    比先进、学先进、赶先进，首先要从比入手。道理很简单：要赶先进，必先学习先进，而要学习先进，又必先明确学习的方向。比，就是发扬先进事物，去为落后现象指明前进的方向。俗话说得好：“不怕不识货，只怕货比货”。不比，先进与落后的矛盾不易为人们察觉；一比，谁先进，谁落后，就一目了然。通过比不但可以树立先进旗帜，激发和鼓舞广大职工力争上游，急起直追，促使先进者倍加努力、争取更先进；而且便于发现和总结先进经验，为人们指引前进的具体道路。
    比的意义和作用是很明显的。问题是怎么比法。
    我们说，比法有三。一要比的全。世界上十全十美的事情是没有的，所谓先进与落后，也是就比较而言的。在实际生产活动中，先进与落后的差别，往往错综复杂，先进中有落后，落后中有先进。先进单位不可能“白璧无瑕”，落后单位也不致于一无可取。这种事例，在日常生活中，人们屡见不鲜。所以，哪里有先进与落后的差别，就要往哪里比，谁在某一方面有一技之长，大家就要向他的这一长处学习。只有这样，我们的竞赛才能真正体现互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高的原则，并且通过比，达到相互推动，共同跃进。
    二要比的深。比只是一种手段，目的是通过比，树立对立面，揭露矛盾，采取措施，解决矛盾，推动运动不断前进。因此，重要的是透过现象，比本质，也就是不仅要比出谁先进，谁落后，先进在什么地方，落后在哪些方面，而且要比出先进和落后的原因所在。这就是要通过比大力发展先进思想，抓紧总结和推广先进经验，同时热忱地帮助落后，促使落后的努力学习，赶上先进。
    三要不断的比。先进与落后是客观存在，在生产运动中，开始总是由少数先进的人，先进的单位走在前头，当一般人、一般单位赶上少数先进的人、先进单位的时候，新的先进者、先进单位又必然出现，从而形成新的先进与落后的差别，可见，新的差别不断地代替旧的差别，差别本身的变化则永无止境。同时，先进与落后又是相对的，有时候这一部分人、这一部分单位走在前头，有时候，另一部分人、另一部分单位领先。所以，在竞赛中，不仅要年年比、季季比，而且要月月比、旬旬比、甚至要日日比，时时比、只有这样比的勤，才能鞭策落后的加劲，迎头赶上，使先进的没有骄傲的时间，百尺竿头，更进一步，从而促进生产一浪推一浪，一浪高一浪。
    社会主义竞赛是革命的友谊竞赛，因此，在竞赛中，就要发扬共产主义协作精神，提倡相互学习，相互帮助。先进者要有诲人不倦的精神，无私地把自己的经验教给别人、落后者要有力争上游的热情，积极学习并赶上先进。
