Xinhua News Agency, April 24th. Xirao Jiacuo, a renowned scholar of Buddhist studies in Tibet for 33 years and President of the Buddhist Association of China, today spoke to our reporter, indignantly condemning the so-called statement published on the 22nd in the name of the Dalai Lama as nothing more than a falsehood built upon falsehood, using lies to cover up lies.

Master Xirao Jiacuo said: The second so-called statement by the Dalai Lama, by explicitly admitting that the first so-called statement was "published under the Dalai Lama's authorization," has already exposed that the statement was not written by the Dalai Lama. However, Indian Foreign Service official Menon still insisted on the same day that the second so-called statement was published: "There is no doubt that the statement was written by the Dalai Lama." This completely proves that someone is determined to impose shameless slander on the Dalai Lama.

Master Xirao Jiacuo is 76 years old this year. He is proficient in Buddhist scriptures and Tibetan literature and history, and also has a knowledge of Sanskrit, etc. His students are all over the front and back Tibet and the three major monasteries. Master Xirao Jiacuo pointed out: From the Tibetan writing style and grammatical structure, it is clear at a glance that the so-called statement by the Dalai Lama is not at all in the Tibetan style. It makes one suspect that the statement was initially drafted in English. He said: First, everyone knows that the letters and articles written by the Dalai Lama in the past, the orders and announcements issued, all used first-person pronouns such as "I," "myself," and "we," for example, "Kho-Rang" and "Da" in Tibetan, and never used the third-person pronoun "he." Even when others refer to the Dalai Lama, they use the most honorable titles such as "Your Presence," "Inside," "Buddha," and "Savior." It is absolutely impossible to use the word "he" to refer to the Dalai Lama in documents. Second, there is no such word as "suzerainty" in Tibetan. "Lord" and "authority" express almost the same meaning in Tibetan, which is the same concept as sovereignty. He said: I don't know what the meaning of creating the term "suzerainty" is. Xirao Jiacuo said: Third, the first so-called statement by the Dalai Lama exposed an absurd argument from the very beginning. The fact that Han people and Tibetan people are different is common knowledge that is easily understood by ordinary people. The statement actually uses this as a reason to separate Tibet from the motherland, which is a big joke. Only the most stupid person would say such a thing. I understand very well that the Dalai Lama is definitely not such a stupid person.

Xirao Jiacuo then sternly condemned the despicable act of the statement's drafters who disregarded historical facts and violated the Dalai Lama's opinions, and refuted the fallacy that "Tibet is acting as an independent country." He said: From the historical point of view, when the Dalai Lama issued orders in the past, he had to write "By Imperial Mandate, King of Dharma in the Western Buddha Land, Religious Leader on Earth, Omniscient, Vajradhara Dalai Lama" in front of the announcement. During the reign of the seventh Dalai Lama in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, the Kashag (i.e., the Tibetan local government) was established with the approval of the Qing court. The thirteen ranks of officials in the Kashag had to be approved and appointed by the Qing court, and they were all under the leadership of the Qing Dynasty's resident minister in Tibet. This shows the relationship between Tibet and the motherland. The drafters of the statement are now talking nonsense about so-called "independent countries" and "autonomy," portraying the Dalai Lama as a person who pretends to obey but actually disobeys, and portraying the Dalai Lama as an ignorant person. Xirao Jiacuo said: I express my great indignation at this.

Master Xirao Jiacuo finally said: Liars try to defend their lies, and the loopholes become more and more numerous. Their lies may appear like ocean waves in the future. Even if they fabricate so-called statements a hundred more times, they cannot deceive people. How can truth be found in falsehood?

    喜饶嘉错怒斥盗用达赖名义的卑鄙勾当
    假话里怎能找出真理  用谎言怎能掩盖谎言
    新华社24日讯　在西藏研究佛学达三十三年的著名学者、中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错大师今天向本社记者发表谈话，愤慨地谴责22日盗用达赖喇嘛名义发表的所谓声明，不过是假上作假，用谎言掩盖谎言。
    喜饶嘉错大师说：第二次所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，既然明白地承认了第一次所谓声明是在达赖喇嘛“授权下发表的”，这就已经暴露了那个声明不是达赖喇嘛写的。但是，印度外交官员梅农竟然在第二次所谓声明发表的同一天，还坚持说：“毫无疑问，声明是达赖喇嘛写的”。这就完全证明有人硬要将无耻的诽谤强加在达赖喇嘛身上。
    喜饶嘉错大师今年已经七十六岁，他精通佛典和西藏的文学和历史，并旁通梵文等，他的学生遍及前藏后藏和三大寺。喜饶嘉错大师指出：从藏文的文体和语法结构来看，一眼就看出所谓达赖喇嘛的声明根本就不是西藏的文体，使人不能不怀疑，这个声明头一遍就是用英文起草的。他说：第一、大家都清楚，达赖喇嘛过去写的信件和文章，发的命令和布告，都是用“我”、“自己”、“吾”等等第一人称的字样来表达的，例如藏语中“可我”、“达”，而从来没有用过第三人称的“他”字。就是别人称呼达赖喇嘛，也是用“驾前”、“里面的”、“佛”、“救主”等等最尊贵的称呼，是决不能用“他”的字样在文件里称呼达赖喇嘛的。第二、藏文中根本没有“宗主权”这个词汇，“主”和“权”在藏文中表达的几乎是同一个意思，和主权是同一个概念。他说：我不知道制造“宗主权”这个名词，到底是什么意思。喜饶嘉错说：第三、第一次所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，一开头就暴露了一个荒谬的论点。汉人和藏人不同，本是一般人容易了解的常识，声明居然把这当做使西藏从祖国分裂出去的理由，真是个天大的笑话。只有最愚蠢的人才说这样的话，我很了解，达赖喇嘛决不是这样愚蠢的人。
    喜饶嘉错接着严厉谴责了声明起草人不顾历史事实，强奸达赖喇嘛意见的卑鄙勾当，批驳了所谓“西藏是作为一个独立国家进行活动”的谬论。他说：从过去的历史上看，达赖喇嘛在发布命令的时候，都是要在布告前面写明“钦命西方佛土法王·地上教主·一切智·金刚持达赖喇嘛”的字样。到清乾隆第七世达赖喇嘛时，由清廷批准成立了噶厦（即西藏地方政府），噶厦的十三级官职，都必须由清廷批准任命，并且都属清朝驻藏大臣的领导，这就说明了西藏和祖国的关系。声明的起草人现在妄谈所谓“独立国家”和“自治”，把达赖喇嘛说成是种阳奉阴违的人，把达赖喇嘛说成是种无知的人。喜饶嘉错说：我对此表示极大愤慨。
    喜饶嘉错大师最后说：说谎者自己辩解谎言，漏洞越来越多。他们的谎言今后可能还会象海波一样地出现，那怕是再制造一百次所谓声明，也是骗不了人的，假话里面怎么能够找出真理呢？
