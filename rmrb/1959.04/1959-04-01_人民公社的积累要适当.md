The rectification and construction of people's communes require a lot of work. Correctly handling the relationship between accumulation and consumption in the income of people's communes is an important aspect of this.

Some people believe that in the early days of people's communes, it is impossible to both ensure the improvement of the lives of commune members and ensure the appropriate expansion of the commune's accumulation. However, facts have given the opposite answer. As everyone knows, based on the great leap forward in production in 1958, many people's communes established collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly, achieving "eating without money," and implemented a system combining wages and supply, which improved the material living standards of the vast number of peasants. At the same time, people's communes carried out large-scale capital construction and accumulated a large amount of wealth. The small industrial production units run by people's communes reached several million. People's communes also built many simple roads and some earthen railways, dredged many waterways, built many primary and secondary schools, and built many public houses. The improvement of the lives of commune members has stimulated a high degree of enthusiasm, and the increase in accumulation has strengthened the material and technical strength of the communes. The combination of these two aspects will enable the production and construction of people's communes to continue to leap forward in the future.

Of course, to handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption well, we need to carry out many detailed tasks. The current situation in our country is: on the one hand, in order to widely realize national industrialization, commune industrialization, and agricultural mechanization and electrification within fifteen, twenty, or more years, the state and the people's communes must continuously increase accumulation; on the other hand, neither the country as a whole nor each commune has fundamentally changed its backward economic outlook, labor productivity is still not high, and the level of people's lives is still relatively low, and the increase in accumulation cannot but be subject to certain restrictions. This is a contradiction. In this situation, it is even more necessary for us to seriously and cautiously handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption, especially the relationship between accumulation and consumption in the income of people's communes.

To develop production at high speed, it is necessary to continuously expand accumulation. However, it cannot be assumed that the current objective conditions can be ignored and accumulation can be expanded indefinitely. Our people's communes have just been established, and there are indeed many things to be done. If the comrades in charge of this part of the work advocate doing more of this kind of thing, and the comrades in charge of that part of the work advocate doing more of that kind of thing, attempting to do all the things at once, then it is inevitable to expand accumulation indefinitely. This is obviously impossible. Forcing it will not only disperse manpower, material resources, and financial resources, making it impossible to do those necessary things, but may also become detached from the masses and cause political losses. The result is that wanting to do more will actually result in less; wanting to do it faster will actually result in slower progress. On the contrary, if we concentrate our efforts on doing the most necessary and most important things first, it may seem that things are being done less and slower from a temporary and local perspective, but in reality, they will be more and faster. If we do nothing or do less in the secondary aspects, we can achieve great things in the primary aspects. If we first do well the things that are most necessary to do at present, we will create conditions for doing more things in the future. That is to say, contradictions must be resolved one by one, and first and foremost, the main contradictions must be resolved; once the main contradictions are resolved, the secondary contradictions will be easier to resolve. To resolve contradictions, there needs to be every possible means; only one means is not enough. We not only do not oppose but also encourage more ideas and more methods. However, for leaders, they should choose the plan that is of decisive significance to the development of our cause from among many plans, and choose the most effective methods and measures from among many methods and measures, and should not be "多端寡要" [having many ideas but few key points].

When people's communes are being rectified and constructed, they should improve the lives of commune members and expand accumulation based on their income, according to possibility and need, so as to take the overall situation into consideration. Under the premise of ensuring the completion of the state-stipulated tax tasks, rationally arrange the proportion of wages, in-kind distribution, public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, production costs, and management expenses within the commune, so that more than 90% of the commune members can increase their income, the remaining commune members will not reduce their income, and the commune can gradually and appropriately increase accumulation year by year, in order to correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption. At the same time, the production and construction of industry, agriculture, and other undertakings should be appropriately arranged according to the situation of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, in order to correctly handle the relationship between agricultural construction and industrial construction, and between productive construction and non-productive construction.

In people's communes, the Party's policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture should continue to be implemented. However, it must be seen that without the sound development of the agricultural economy, the sound development of the industrial economy is impossible. The development of industry in communes should be carried out under the premise of ensuring the rapid development of agriculture; the funds and labor force of communes should be mainly used for agriculture. In our country's agriculture at present, the accumulation of funds is growing year by year, but it is still impossible to provide as much accumulation as large industrial enterprises. At the same time, under the conditions that agriculture has not yet realized mechanization and electrification, the development of agricultural production and construction can only mainly rely on the full exertion of manpower and the gradual improvement of existing farm tools. If too much accumulation is extracted from agriculture for industrial investment, or too much labor force is transferred from agriculture to industry, it will inevitably hinder the rapid development of agriculture. In this way, although commune industry may develop faster for a period of time, it will be difficult to develop sustainably and healthily, and thus ultimately the goal of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture will not be achieved. Therefore, communes should run industries in a step-by-step manner, and should not run too many at once. If too many have been run, they should be adjusted, and the excessive funds and labor force occupied by industry should be transferred back to agriculture.

The focus of commune capital construction is productive construction, and non-productive construction must not spend too much money, and the construction standards must not be too high. Otherwise, it will not only cause waste of material resources, but will inevitably increase a large number of non-productive personnel, causing waste of labor. It is necessary for communes to carry out some long-term construction according to the state's plan and the commune's long-term development plan, such as building water conservancy projects, planting large areas of forests, improving soil, mining mineral resources, and improving living conditions. However, this kind of construction should also not occupy too much funds and labor, hindering the development of current production.

In order to use accumulation appropriately and give play to the initiative of the commune's various levels of organization, the commune should avoid the shortcomings of the commune management committee concentrating too much and too rigidly when handling the relationship between accumulation and consumption and when using accumulation, and should implement the principle of "unified leadership, decentralized management" of the people's communes adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In this way, our people's communes will be rapidly consolidated and developed.

    人民公社的积累要适当
    洪行
    整顿和建设人民公社，需要做很多的工作。正确地处理人民公社收入中积累和消费的关系，是其中重要的一项。
    有人认为，在人民公社初创时期，既要保证社员的生活有所改善，又要保证公社的积累适当扩大，是办不到的。但是，事实却作了相反的答复。大家知道，在1958年生产大跃进的基础上，许多人民公社创办了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等集体福利事业，做到了“吃饭不要钱”，实行了工资制和供给制相结合的制度，提高了广大农民的物质生活水平。同时，人民公社进行了大规模的基本建设，积累了大量的财富。人民公社举办的小型工业生产单位，达到了几百万个。人民公社还修建了很多简易公路和一些土铁路，疏通了很多航道，建设了很多小学和中学，盖起了许多公共房屋。社员由于生活改善而发挥了高度的积极性，公社由于积累增加而壮大了自己的物质技术力量，这两方面相结合，将使人民公社的生产、建设事业，在今后能够继续大跃进。
    当然，要把积累和消费的关系处理得很好，需要我们进行许多细致的工作。我国目前的情况是：一方面，为了在十五年、二十年或者更多一些的时间内，广泛地实现国家工业化、公社工业化和农业机械化电气化，国家和人民公社都必须不断地增加积累；另一方面，无论是全国或者每个公社，经济落后的面貌还没有得到根本的改变，劳动生产率还不高，人民生活的水平也还比较低，积累的增加不能不受到一定的限制。这是一个矛盾。在这种情况下面，就更加要求我们严肃地对待和审慎地处理积累和消费之间的关系，特别是人民公社收入中的积累和消费之间的关系。
    要高速度地发展生产，就必须不断地扩大积累。但是，不能认为可以不顾当前的客观条件，无限度地扩大积累。我们的人民公社刚刚建立起来，要兴办的事情的确很多。如果管这一部分工作的同志主张多办这种事情，管那一部分工作的同志又主张多办那种事情，企图把所有的事情都一下子办起来，那就必然要无限度地扩大积累。这显然是不可能的。勉强去做，不仅会分散人力、物力和财力，使那些必需办的事情办不起来，而且可能脱离群众，造成政治上的损失。结果是：想搞得多，反而会少；想搞得快，反而会慢。相反，如果我们集中力量首先去办那些最必需的、最主要的事情，可能从一时一地看来，事情好像办得少一些和慢一些，而实际上反而会多一些和快一些。我们在次要的方面有所不为，或者少有所为，就可以在主要的方面大有所为。我们首先办好了当前最必需办的事情，也就为以后办更多的事情创造了条件。这就是说，矛盾必须一个一个地解决，而首先必须解决主要的矛盾；主要的矛盾解决了，次要的矛盾也就比较容易解决。要解决矛盾，就需要有千方百计，只有一方一计是不行的。我们不仅不反对而且提倡多出主意、多想办法。但是，对于领导人员来说，应当在许多方案中选择对我们事业的发展有决定意义的方案，在许多办法和措施中选择最有效的办法和措施，而不能“多端寡要”。
    人民公社在进行整顿和建设的时候，应当根据自己收入的情况，根据可能和需要，改善社员的生活和扩大积累，做到统筹全局。在保证完成国家规定的税收任务的前提下，合理地安排社内的工资、实物分配、公积金、公益金、生产费用、管理费用的比例，做到90％以上的社员能够增加收入，其余的社员不致减少收入，做到公社能够逐年地、适当地增加积累，以便正确地处理积累和消费之间的关系。同时，应当根据人力、物力和财力的状况，适当地安排工业、农业和其他事业的生产和建设，以便正确地处理农业建设和工业建设之间、生产性建设和非生产性建设之间的关系。
    在人民公社中，应当继续贯彻党的工业和农业同时并举的方针。但是，必须看到，如果没有农业经济的健全发展，工业经济的健全发展是不可能的。公社发展工业，要在保证农业迅速发展的前提下进行；公社的资金和劳动力，应当主要是用于农业方面。我国目前农业中，资金的积累正在逐年增长，但是还不可能像大工业企业那样提供大量的积累。同时，在农业还没有实现机械化电气化的条件下，农业生产和建设的发展还只能主要依靠人力的充分发挥和对现有农具的逐步改进。如果从农业中抽取过多的积累用于工业的投资，或从农业中抽调过多的劳动力用于工业方面，就势必妨碍农业的迅速发展。这样，公社工业虽然在一个时期内可能得到较快的发展，但是却很难持久地健全地发展下去，因而最后也就达不到工业和农业同时并举的目的。所以，公社举办工业，要有步骤地进行，而不要一下子办得过多。办得过多了的，要加以调整，把工业占用的过多的资金和劳动力转回到农业方面来。
    公社基本建设的重点是生产性的建设，非生产性建设决不能花费过多的资金，建设的标准也不能过高。否则，不仅会造成物力的浪费，而且势必会增加大量的非生产人员，造成劳动力的浪费。公社根据国家的计划和本社的长远发展规划，进行一些长远性的建设，如兴修水利工程、大片造林、改良土壤、开采矿藏、改善居住条件等等，是必要的。但是，这种建设同样不能占用过多的资金和劳动力，妨碍当前生产的发展。
    为了使积累用得恰当，并且发挥公社各级组织的积极性，公社在处理积累和消费之间的关系以及在使用积累的时候，应当避免公社管理委员会集中过多过死的缺点，应当贯彻执行党的八届六中全会关于人民公社实行“统一领导、分级管理”的原则。这样，我们的人民公社才会迅速地得到巩固和发展。
