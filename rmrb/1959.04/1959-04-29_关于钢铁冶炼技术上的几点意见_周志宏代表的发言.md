Speech by Representative Zhou Zhihong

Presidium, fellow representatives:

I would now like to express my opinions on the question of how to guarantee this year's steel production "with steel as the key link".

Last year, China's steel production was 11.08 million tons. This was a remarkable achievement under the leadership of the Party and on the basis of the great leap forward in mass consciousness. This year, the planned steel production is 18 million tons. In today's situation of an even greater leap forward, we have reason to believe that it is possible to overfulfill this year's production target.

These two figures—11.08 million tons and 18 million tons—are not simple. They illustrate two points: first, they signify that China has transformed from a backward country to an industrialized one, and the situation is compelling us to rapidly and dramatically stride towards industrialization, which is a very encouraging thing; second, they demonstrate the greatness and correctness of the Party's policies, and that the Party is good at and dares to mobilize the masses and follow the mass line, which is fully reflected in steel production.

Not long ago, when the nationwide "with steel as the key link" mass steelmaking campaign was in full swing last year, some people held skeptical attitudes. Their reasons for doubt were: first, that making steel through mass campaigns was too costly in terms of raw materials and not worth the effort; second, that indigenous steel was not steel and had quality problems. I believe that these skeptical views have already been resolved in the face of today's facts. A mass steelmaking campaign of the scale of last year was not only unprecedented in the history of Chinese steelmaking, but also something that no Western country would dare or be able to imagine. In the past, only a few people ran the steel industry in old China. Now, all the new Chinese people are personally participating in the steelmaking ranks, completely breaking the mysterious view of steelmaking. This has laid a solid foundation for the development of China's steel industry, taken root, and unprecedentedly strengthened the steelmaking ranks. The scale and speed of training skilled professional technicians and cadres in this way is also something that no Western country can achieve.

Some people also believe that indigenous steel cannot be called steel. In fact, this is a narrow view. There is a great need for indigenous steel in the vast rural areas of the country. Professor Aston in the United States acknowledged the excellent properties of indigenous steel in his research report. He even set up a factory to produce this kind of steel using synthetic methods and promoted its use. This is one example. Thanks to the mass steelmaking campaign, not only was the production of 10.07 million tons of steel guaranteed, but also some larger-scale steel plants were able to free up time to expand their equipment and further expand their smelting capacity. The great achievements of China's "with steel as the key link, mass steelmaking" movement prove that economically backward countries, as long as they rely on the people and are determined, can completely rely on their own hands to build their own huge steel industry through self-reliance!

This year, China's planned steel production is 18 million tons. This is not a simple matter. It involves many economic sectors and affects the entire national economy. To achieve this great target, we must do everything possible and go all out. Here, I would like to express some opinions only on steelmaking technology:

(1) On strengthening the technical measures for small blast furnaces and converters: In this year's iron production plan, the production of small blast furnaces accounts for 50% of the total output, and in the steel production plan, converter steel will account for more than 50% of the total output. Therefore, how to normalize the production of small blast furnaces and converters across the country and further achieve the goal of high output is the main key to ensuring the successful completion of this year's 18 million tons of steel. The Steel Department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the relevant research departments, institutes, and factories have already done a lot of work in this area and have achieved certain successes. How to normalize the production of small blast furnaces and converters? This is an important issue at present. From my personal observation, after vigorously promoting coal washing and coking and strengthening transportation, the supply of raw materials and the sulfur content will be improved to a certain extent. In the future, we can focus on improving furnace age, increasing smelting temperature, and strengthening operating techniques as key measures. Large blast furnaces can continuously produce for six or seven years after being put into operation. The life of small blast furnaces should be able to be maintained for three to five years without any problems. However, the furnace age of general small blast furnaces is not high at present, and there may be some problems with the furnace type and operation. The main reason is still the refractory materials. This situation is also reflected in the converter linings, especially the alkaline linings, and is particularly serious, becoming a problem that needs to be solved urgently. The current situation is that converter linings need to be replaced after smelting from 20 to 30 or 50 to 60 heats. Often, production is forced to stop due to insufficient reserves, which affects normal production. Therefore, in order to strengthen the production of small blast furnaces and converters, we must first improve the quality of refractory materials and strengthen the testing and research of refractory materials. Among them, the research on the life of dolomite linings, I believe, can be listed as one of the important research topics (dolomite is available everywhere, but its properties are not the same. The research on the life of dolomite linings can be carried out in a regional manner). In addition, the method of stabilizing dolomite is also worth testing and researching.

Smelting temperature is another important key in steelmaking technology. The development from reverberatory furnaces to open-hearth furnaces and from tube-type hot blast stoves to Cowper stoves fully illustrates this point. Increasing the hot blast temperature and supplying sufficient air volume can make the blast furnace run smoothly, increase production, and reduce the coke ratio. Domestically, individual small blast furnaces have increased the hot blast temperature to 700 degrees Celsius (according to reports), and have completely produced qualified pig iron. The hot blast stove used by such small blast furnaces should be quickly field tested, and its furnace type, pipe structure, pipe materials, etc. should be standardized and promoted. The melting furnaces in converter shops also need hot blast operation, so that the molten iron temperature can be increased. If alkaline linings and alkaline slag are used at the same time, desulfurization can also be carried out. According to the current situation, it is increasingly necessary to strengthen the construction of hot blast alkaline melting furnaces and the hot blast devices used, and to further select typical ones for promotion.

Technical operation has a certain impact on the smooth operation and life of the furnace. In last year's mass steelmaking campaign, a strong steel team has been rapidly expanded, but the level of technical proficiency is uneven. Training should be strengthened and experience exchanges should be expanded. Basically, we must first be able to master the operating procedures.

(2) Expanding the variety of steel products: This year, the output of converters will account for half of the total output. Therefore, the types of steel produced in the future must not be limited to smelting low-carbon structural steel. More new types of steel should be produced using converters. Open-hearth furnaces should be used to smelt more alloy steel, and electric furnaces should undertake the task of trial-smelting various high-alloy steel varieties. At present, iron alloys are being produced normally in China, but the variety is still relatively small. The large-scale production is still limited to silicon iron and some manganese iron, which cannot meet the needs of the increasingly developing situation. Increasing the variety of iron alloys, such as tungsten, chromium, vanadium, titanium, and other iron alloys, as well as other composite iron alloys, is not only used to meet the needs of making complex high-grade alloy steel, but some of these iron alloys are also strong and effective degassing agents.

(3) Increasing the production rate and utilization rate of steel: There is a certain loss from steel ingots to steel products. The average loss is about 20% to 25%. Improving the riser can significantly reduce shrinkage cavities, but the total loss is still large. According to the continuous casting method that is effective abroad, metal can be saved by 15% to 20%. There are already five continuous casting workshops in normal production in the Soviet Union. In China, Shanghai, Chongqing, the Northeast and other regions, especially Shanghai, have successfully trial-produced this kind of ingot casting machine as early as the end of 1957. If it is combined with converters and put into experimental production in a relatively short period of time, and then promoted for large-scale use after gaining certain experience, it will greatly help increase the output of steel.

How to improve the utilization rate of steel in mechanical processing is also an important issue. For example, the utilization rate of steel materials in bearing manufacturing may vary greatly depending on the different processing methods, from 25% to 75%. The steel material utilization rate of some factories in China is still not high, and we need to strengthen this aspect. For example, changing bar stock to tubing, using rolling instead of turning, and reducing the allowance not only improves the material utilization rate, but also enhances the strength of the shaft sleeve. Obviously, this is an important direction, and other manufacturing processes can also develop in this direction, such as reducing processes, precision forging and casting, and extrusion. The above two measures can allow the same amount of molten steel to produce more steel and more products.

(4) Adopting new technologies: The promotion and use of continuous casting in converter plants is conducive to continuous operation and can save steel, as has been mentioned earlier. In addition, there are some other new technologies worth adopting and promoting, such as the use of top-blown oxygen in converters. The advantage of this method is that it can improve the quality of converter steel to be equal to that of open-hearth steel. Domestically, it still needs to go through the stage of production-style testing and then to full-scale promotion. However, the main key to adopting this method is still the large and cheap supply of oxygen. The problem of the supply of oxygen machines must be solved. In this regard, some qualified factories can be designated to actively prepare and conduct trial production. Oxygen machines are not only needed for top-blown converters, but also have their uses in open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, and even blast furnaces.

"Liningless" melting furnaces have been put into normal production in several foreign countries. They not only have a high melting rate, but can also work for a long time. Hot air can be used and suitable slag can be selected. Another feature is that iron and slag are discharged separately by siphon, and a thick layer of molten slag is maintained in the hearth, which has more contact with the molten iron, which is conducive to desulfurization.

These favorable conditions make it an ideal iron-melting tool in alkaline converter shops. Several factories can be selected in China for trial use, so that it can be fully promoted after success is achieved.

For example, the mixed steelmaking method is an effective method to improve quality. Open-hearth furnaces and converters can be combined with electric furnaces. Some factories in China have had successful trials and can be vigorously promoted.

(5) Training technical cadres: With the mass steelmaking campaign, an unprecedentedly strong steel team has grown rapidly, but from the perspective of the needs of the increasingly developing steel industry, training a large number of technical cadres is still an important issue. In the newly built large-scale steel plants, there are still not many technical cadres who have graduated from junior colleges and universities. Therefore, metallurgical technical cadres are not more, but less, at present and for a considerable period of time, and need to be vigorously trained. Last year, the preparations for establishing metallurgical majors in various provinces and cities were powerful measures to meet the needs of the current situation. However, the common problems that exist are the lack of teachers and the shortage of equipment, which need to be solved first. Therefore, while blossoming everywhere, I believe that it is necessary to strengthen and enrich those metallurgical departments and institutes that already have the conditions and foundations, so that they can take on more and take on earlier the task of training technical cadres. Strengthening and enriching those metallurgical professional institutions that already have the conditions and foundations provides seeds for blossoming everywhere! It is in line with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical and walking on two legs!

The above are my personal views on increasing this year's steel production. I believe that these are some of the main issues at present. Some of them are already underway, and some are about to be carried out. It should be pointed out that in order to complete this year's great steel production target, we must not only ensure the quantity of 18 million tons of steel, but also ensure the quality of 18 million tons of steel. Therefore, the task is extremely arduous. At the same time, striving for time is also an important factor that cannot be ignored.

Fellow representatives: This year, China's steel production will leap to 18 million tons. As someone who has been engaged in metallurgical work for many years, I am particularly excited, excited, and proud of this. New China and the new Chinese steel industry, like the rising sun, have infinitely beautiful and broad prospects and development. I firmly believe that our new Chinese steel industry, under the leadership of the Party, will have a greater and faster leap forward. Let us cheer for the greater and faster leap forward of the new Chinese steel industry! And make the greatest and best efforts for this!

专栏：

    关于钢铁冶炼技术上的几点意见
    周志宏代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我现在就“以钢为纲”如何保证今年钢产量的问题发表意见。
    去年我国的钢产量为一千一百零八万吨。这是在党的领导下，群众觉悟大跃进的基础上出色完成的；今年预定钢的产量为一千八百万吨。在更大跃进形势下的今天，来看今年的产量数字，我们有理由相信，有可能可以超额完成。
    这两个数字——一千一百零八万吨和一千八百万吨不是很简单的。说明了两个问题：第一，它标志着我国已经由落后的国家走向工业化，而且形势逼人，在迅速、大踏步地走向工业化了，这是令人十分欢欣鼓舞的一件事；第二，它说明了党的政策的伟大和正确，说明了党是善于和敢于发动群众、走群众路线的，在钢铁生产方面也充分的体现了这一点。
    时间还相隔不久，当去年全国开展着轰轰烈烈的“以钢为纲”、全民炼钢运动的时候，有过一些人是抱着怀疑态度的。他们怀疑的理由：第一是以运动方式炼钢，原材料过费，得不偿失，第二认为土钢不是钢，质量上有问题。这些怀疑的观点，我想在今天的事实面前是已经获得了解决的。像去年那样声势浩大的全民炼钢运动不但是在我国钢铁冶炼史上所从来没有过的，而且也是任何西方国家所不敢所不能想像的事情。过去在旧中国只有少数人办钢铁工业，现在新中国人人都亲身参加到炼钢行列中去，彻底打破了炼钢的神秘观点，这就为中国钢铁工业的发展打下了牢固的基础，扎下了根，空前地壮大了炼钢队伍。像这样培养熟练专业技工干部的规模与速度，可以说，也不是任何西方国家所能办得到的。
    也有些人认为土钢不能称之为钢。其实，这是一种所见不广的看法。在全国广大农村中对土钢有很大的需要。在美国阿斯登教授的研究报告中就承认了土钢的优良性质，还设厂用合成方法制成这种钢，并且在推广它的用途，这是一个例子。由于全民炼钢运动，不但保证了一千零七十万吨钢的产量，而且使一些较大规模的钢厂有可能腾出时间来进行扩充设备，进一步扩大熔炼能力。我国“以钢为纲，全民炼钢”的运动所取得的伟大成就，证明了经济落后的国家，只要它依靠人民，下定决心，就完全有可能依靠自己的双手，自力更生地建立起自己的巨大钢铁工业！
    今年我国的预定钢产量是一千八百万吨，这不是一件简简单单的事情，牵涉到很多经济部门，影响到整个国民经济，为实现这一伟大指标，我们必须千方百计，全力以赴。这里，只是就钢铁冶炼技术方面发表一些意见：
    （一）关于加强小高炉和转炉的技术措施问题：在今年铁的生产计划中，小高炉的生产占全部产量的百分之五十，而在生产钢的计划中，转炉的钢将占全部产量百分之五十以上，因此怎样使全国的小高炉和转炉生产正常，并进而达到高产量的目标，是确保今年一千八百万吨钢胜利完成的主要关键。冶金部的钢铁司和钢铁有关的研究处、院及各厂在这方面已经做了不少工作，并取得了一定的成就。怎样使小高炉和转炉生产正常化？这是当前的一个重要问题。就我个人的观察，在大力推动洗煤炼焦和加强运输以后，原料的供应和含硫的情况将得到一定程度的改善，今后可以把提高炉龄，提高冶炼温度和加强操作技术三个方面，列为重点措施。大型高炉开炉后，可以连续生产六、七年，小高炉的寿命维持三、五年应该是不成为问题的。但目前一般小高炉的炉龄不高，炉型和操作可能有些问题，而主要的原因还在耐火材料，这一情况同样反映在转炉炉衬，特别是碱性炉衬上面格外严重，成为一个急待解决的问题。目前的情况是：转炉炉衬从二十至三十炉到五十至六十炉吹炼后需要更换，往往由于备用不继被迫停炉，以致影响了正常生产，所以为了加强小高炉、转炉的生产，必须首先提高耐火材料的质量，加强对耐火材料的试验与研究，其中对白云石炉衬寿命的研究，我认为，可以列为重要的研究课题之一（白云石到处皆有，但它的性质并不一致，对白云石的炉衬寿命研究，可以采取分区进行方式）。此外，对白云石的稳定方法同样也是值得试验与研究的。
    冶炼温度是钢铁冶炼技术上又一重要关键。由倒焰炉发展到平炉，管式热风炉发展到古柏式炉，充分说明了这一论点。提高热风温度，鼓足风量可使高炉顺行，增产和降低焦比，在国内已有个别小高炉提高风温到摄氏七百度（根据报道），完全可以生产合格的生铁的经验，对于这样小高炉所采用的热风炉，应该迅速进行现场试验，就其炉型、管道结构，管材等等取得定型并予以推广。转炉车间的化铁炉，同样需用热风操作，这样才可以提高铁液温度，如果用碱性炉衬和碱性渣同时还可以进行脱硫。根据当前的情况，越来越需要对热风碱性化铁炉的构造和所采用的热风装置等加强采取措施，进一步的选择典型予以推广。
    技术操作对炉子的顺行和寿命等有其一定的影响。在去年全民炼钢运动中，已迅速壮大了一支有力的钢铁队伍，但是技术熟练的程度不一，应该加强训练，扩大经验交流，基本上先要做到能掌握操作规程。
    （二）扩大钢铁新品种：今年转炉的产量要占到全部总产量的一半，因而今后所生产的钢种就势必不能单纯地冶炼低炭结构钢。应该利用转炉制炼出更多的新钢种。应该让平炉多炼合金钢，电炉担负起试炼多种高合金钢品种的任务。现时国内已在正常生产铁合金，但从品种上来说，还是比较少的，大量的生产还只限于矽铁及部分锰铁，这是不能满足日益发展的形势需要的。增加铁合金的新品种如钨、铬、钒、钛等铁合金及其他复合铁合金的生产不仅用以适应制炼复杂高级合金钢的需要，而且其中的一些铁合金是强有效的脱气剂。
    （三）增加钢材的生产率和利用率：从钢锭到钢材有其一定的损耗，平均损耗约为百分之二十至二十五左右，改善冒口，可使缩空显著减少，但总损耗仍然大，根据国外行之有效的连续浇注方法，可以节省金属达到百分之十五至二十，在苏联已有五个连续铸锭车间在正常生产，在我国上海、重庆、东北等地区，其中尤以上海最早，远在一九五七年底均已先后试制成功这种铸锭机，如与转炉配合，在较短的时间内投入试验性的生产，并在取得一定经验后推广大量使用，对于提高钢材的产量是有很大的帮助的。
    在机制加工中，怎样提高钢材利用率也是一个重要的问题。例如轴承制造用不同的加工方法，钢料利用率可能相差很大，从百分之二十五至七十五。国内有些厂的钢料利用率还不高，在这方面有待于我们的加强。又如改棒材为管材，用碾压的方法代替车制，降低留量，这样不但提高了材料利用率，而且增强了轴套的强度。显然，这是一个重要的方向，其他制造工艺也都可以向这一方向发展，如减少工序，精密锻铸和挤压等等。上述两项措施可以使同量的钢液，得到更多的钢材，生产出更多的制品。
    （四）采用新技术：连续铸锭在转炉厂推广使用有利于连续的作业，并可节约钢材，已在前面述及。除此以外，还有一些新技术值得采用推广，例如转炉顶吹氧气的采用。这个方法的优点是能使转炉钢的质量提高到与平炉钢相等，国内在这方面还须要经过生产式的试验进而到全面推广的阶段。但是采用这个方法的主要关键还在于氧气的大量和廉价的供应。要解决氧气机的供应问题。在这方面可以指定一些有条件的工厂积极准备，进行试制，氧气机不仅为顶吹转炉所需要，在平炉电炉以至高炉都有它的用途。
    “无衬”化铁炉，在国外已有好几座正常投入生产，不仅熔化率高，而且可以长期工作。可以采用热风，选用适合的炉渣。另一特点用虹吸的方式分别出铁出渣，炉缸内保持一层较厚的熔渣，与铁液有较多的接触，有利于脱硫。
    这些有利条件，使它成为碱性转炉车间中一个理想的熔铁工具。在国内可以选择几个厂进行试用，以便在取得成效后，从事全面推广。
    又如混合炼钢法是改进品质的一种有效方法，平炉转炉都可与电炉配合进行，国内已有一些厂试有成效，可以大力推广。
    （五）培养技术干部：随着全民炼钢运动，一支空前壮大的钢铁队伍已经迅速成长起来了，但从钢铁日益发展的形势需要来说，培养大量技术干部仍然是重要的课题。在新建的大型钢铁厂中，专科、大学毕业的技术干部还是为数不多，所以冶金技术干部在目前以至一个相当长的时间不是多了，而是少了，需要大力进行培养，去年各省、市在筹办冶金专业设置，正是适应当前形势需要的有力措施。但是存在着的共同问题是师资缺乏和设备不足等，这是需要首先大力解决的。因此，在遍地开花的同时，我认为，有必要把那些已有条件的、有基础的冶金系、院加强和充实，使它们能多担负起、早担负起培养技术干部的任务，加强和充实那些已有条件的有基础的冶金专业机构，正是为遍地开花提供了种子！是符合多、快、好、省、两条腿走路的精神的！
    以上是我个人对提高今年钢铁产量的看法，认为这是当前的一些主要问题。其中有些是已经在进行的，有些是将要进行的，应该指出：为了完成今年的伟大的钢铁生产指标，不仅要确保一千八百万吨钢的数量，而且要确保一千八百万吨钢的质量，因此任务是异常艰巨的。同时在时间上的争取也是不可忽视的一个重要因素。
    各位代表：今年我国的钢产量将要跃进到一千八百万吨了。作为一个多年来从事冶金方面工作的我，对此格外感到激动、兴奋和骄傲，新中国和新的中国钢铁工业，正如初升的太阳一样，有着无限美好广阔的前途和发展，我坚决相信，我们新中国的钢铁工业，在党的领导下，将有更大更快的跃进。让我们为新中国的钢铁工业更大更快的跃进欢呼！并为此作出最大最好的努力！
