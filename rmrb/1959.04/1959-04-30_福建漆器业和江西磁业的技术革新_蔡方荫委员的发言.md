In full support of Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, which not only summarizes the great achievements our country has made in industry, agriculture, transportation, culture, education, science and technology, as well as politics and diplomacy in the past few years, but also correctly points out that the development of our national economy in 1958 was "a huge and comprehensive leap forward," laying a solid foundation and preparing favorable conditions for the continued great leap forward of the national economy in 1959.

I only spent a little over two weeks inspecting some projects in Fujian and Jiangxi provinces this time. It was a fleeting look, and my work was obviously not in-depth. Now, I will only use the famous lacquerware industry in Fuzhou and the porcelain industry in Jiangxi as examples. Based on my personal observation and experience, I will use the method of "using the small to illustrate the big" and "using one example to represent ten thousand" to illustrate the situation of the great leap forward in 1958 and the prospects for the continued great leap forward in 1959 in our industrial construction after the great technical revolution based on the principle of "combining foreign and indigenous methods."

Under the guidance of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," leading cadres, technicians, and workers combined with each other, giving full play to the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work. In terms of clever work, they carried out a great technical revolution, and according to the principle of "combining foreign and indigenous methods," they improved many tools, equipment, and operating methods. On the one hand, they greatly increased labor productivity and overfulfilled production tasks. On the other hand, they dared to think and dared to act, creating many new products, and achieving a huge leap forward in both aspects.

In the above-mentioned great leap forward of China's two famous light industries, there are many achievements in improving tools, equipment, and operating methods based on the principle of "combining foreign and indigenous methods." I cannot and need not list them all here, but will only cite one or two examples from each.

When making wooden bodies for Fuzhou lacquerware, all were previously done by hand, but now some machines are used, and these machines are all steel and wood combined, using both foreign and indigenous methods. The raised designs on lacquerware were also previously done entirely by hand, but now the raised designs are prefabricated with molds and then glued onto the lacquerware. Applying lacquer to the body was previously done with brushes, but now some have been changed to sprayers. There are many such improvements in tools, equipment, and operating methods, all of which greatly increase labor productivity.

In addition, they dared to think and dared to act, creating many new lacquerware products that imitated ancient bronze and ancient porcelain. They also used the method of using hemp cloth for the body to make a pair of large lions like those in front of Tiananmen Square, a large vase about three or four meters high, and a tripod with a diameter of more than one meter, as gifts for the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Jingdezhen, Jiangxi is the porcelain capital of China, and is well-known historically and internationally. Before liberation, Jingdezhen's porcelain industry was declining. After liberation, it has been valued and supported by the Party and the government, and has been developing day by day, with the establishment of the Ceramic Research Institute, Ceramic School, and Ceramic Museum to promote the improvement of the porcelain industry. In the great leap forward, the improvement of Jingdezhen's porcelain industry mainly includes the following five aspects:

First, the creation of dozens of "foreign and indigenous" machines. For example, multi-blade pressing machines, automatic circulating blank pressing machines, automatic glazing machines, etc., have greatly increased labor productivity, with the most reaching more than twenty times.

Second, painting on porcelain is a slow operation, and they have created many methods to improve the productivity of painting. For example, using paper to draw the outline of the picture, printing it on the porcelain, using rubber stamps to print patterns, and using underglaze decal paper, etc., among which underglaze decal paper is a huge achievement in the great technical revolution.

Third, the restoration of various color glazes that had been lost for a long time before liberation, such as black gold glaze, sacrificial red glaze, and tea dust glaze, etc., more than fifty kinds. In addition, many new color glazes have been created, such as rose red, firework red, etc., more than thirty kinds.

Fourth, the improvement of sculptural porcelain products. The porcelain figures, birds and animals are lifelike. In the great leap forward, the "eight curly-haired kittens and small pandas" were created, which are vivid and lively, with true-to-life forms, and the quality exceeds that of France, defeating Japan in the international market.

Fifth, the expansion of the application of porcelain in industry and construction. In the past, the application of porcelain in industry and construction was limited to porcelain for power transmission, porcelain for sanitation, and ceramic tiles. Now it has been expanded to blowers, water pumps, paper machines, water pumps, loudspeakers, radiators, alcohol distillation towers, mud mixers, and ball bearings, etc., not only completing the task of "replacing steel with porcelain" and saving steel, but also supporting the production of steel.

Although these two light industries can earn considerable foreign exchange for the country and are worthy of our attention, as I have explained before, the above is only to illustrate the great leap forward of our country's various industries and various aspects of the national economy in 1958 by borrowing from the great leap forward of these two light industries that I have personally experienced. This kind of great leap forward can only be realized under the guidance of the general line, implementing the Party's leadership, implementing the mass line, giving prominence to politics, and giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of leading cadres, technicians, and workers.

As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "The possibilities of technical innovation and technical revolution are unlimited." For the continued great leap forward in 1959, it is still necessary to carry out a great technical revolution according to the principle of "combining foreign and indigenous methods" and strive to improve tools, equipment and operating methods. For example, the natural drying of lacquer is too slow, which makes the time for lacquerware products too long and affects the turnover of funds. If infrared light can be used to accelerate the drying of lacquer, just like baking the paint on car bodies, the time for lacquerware products can be greatly shortened. A certain automobile manufacturing expert also believes that this is feasible. Another example is that the machines for making porcelain blanks can be greatly improved and become a semi-automatic assembly line method, so that labor productivity can be further improved.

In addition, there are still some difficulties in the development of Jingdezhen's porcelain industry that need to be solved urgently. For example, high-grade porcelain still needs wood to burn kilns, not coal, and wood needs to be transported by car from quite a distance, and wood is becoming less and less, so it is necessary to switch to coal completely. The primary power supply in Jingdezhen cannot meet the demand. There is not enough electricity, and other machines such as diesel engines are not easy to buy, so that the mud mixer of a certain porcelain factory cannot be turned, and the mud mixing still needs to be partially operated by the very slow indigenous method by hand. It is hoped that the relevant agencies can study and solve this problem as soon as possible, so that Jingdezhen's porcelain industry can have a greater leap forward in 1959.

In short, judging from the examples of these two light industries, the achievements of the great leap forward of our national economy in 1958 are brilliant, and the prospects for the continued great leap forward in 1959 are beautiful; but there are also considerable difficulties. We should, under the leadership of the Party, give prominence to politics, mobilize the masses, and carry out a great technical revolution to strive for the realization of the continued great leap forward in 1959!

    福建漆器业和江西磁业的技术革新
    蔡方荫委员的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，它不但总结了我国过去几年来在工业、农业、交通运输、文化教育、科学技术以及政治、外交等方面的伟大成就，并且正确地指出一九五八年我国国民经济的发展，“是一个巨大的、全面的跃进”，为一九五九年国民经济的继续大跃进，打好了坚实的基础，准备了有利的条件。
    我这次仅用两周多的时间在福建与江西两省视察了一些项目，走马看花，工作显然未能深入。现在我仅就我国两项著名的轻工业——福州的漆器工业和江西的磁器工业为例子。据我亲眼的观察和亲身的体验，用“以小喻大”和“以一例万”的方式，来说明我国工业建设根据“洋土结合”的方针，大闹技术革命以后，一九五八年大跃进的情况和一九五九年继续大跃进的前景。
    在“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线照耀下，领导干部、技术人员和工人群众互相结合，发挥了实干苦干巧干的精神。在巧干方面，他们大闹技术革命，根据“洋土结合”的方针，改进了许多工具设备和操作方法，一方面使劳动生产率大大地提高，超额完成了生产任务；另一方面敢想敢做，创了许多种的新产品，在这两个方面都实现了巨大的跃进。
    在上述我国两个著名轻工业的大跃进中，根据“洋土结合”的方针，改进工具设备与操作方法的成就是很多的，在这里我不能也不必一一列举，只各举一、二件作为例子。
    福州漆器在制造木胎时，以往全用手工，现在改用一些机器，而这些机器都是钢木合用，洋土结合的。漆器上的堆花，以往也是全用手工，现在堆花是用模子预制而后粘在漆器上的。胎上上漆，以往都是用刷子，现在有些改用喷雾器。诸如此类，在工具设备和操作方法上的改进是很多的，都大大地提高劳动生产率。
    此外，他们还敢想敢做，创造许多仿古铜和仿古磁的漆器新产品。他们又用麻布脱胎的方法，制成了一对像天安门前面的大狮子，一个高约三、四公尺的大花瓶和一个直径约为一公尺多的三足鼎，作为国庆十周年的献礼。
    江西景德镇是中国的磁都，在历史上和在国际上都是很闻名的。在解放前，景德镇的磁业日趋衰落。解放后，得到党和政府的重视和支持、日益发展，办有陶磁研究所，陶磁学校及陶磁馆，以促进磁业的改进。在大跃进中，景德镇磁业的改进主要有下列五个方面：
    一、创造几十种“洋土结合”的机器。例如多刀压胚机，自动循环压坯机，自动上釉机等，大大地提高了劳动生产率，最多的达到二十余倍。
    二、磁上绘画是迟缓的操作，他们创造了许多方法来提高绘画的生产率。例如，用纸画成图画的轮廓，印在磁上，用橡皮图章印花，及釉下贴花纸等，其中釉下贴花纸是大闹技术革命中的一项巨大的成就。
    三、恢复解放前长期失传的种种色釉，例如乌金釉，祭红釉，茶叶末釉等五十余种。此外，并创造了许多新的色釉，例如玫瑰红，焰火红等三十余种。
    四、改进了雕塑磁产品。磁制的人物、禽兽，栩栩如生。在大跃进中，创制了“八只卷毛小猫和小熊猫”，生动活泼，形态毕真，质量超过法国，在国际市场上打败了日本。
    五、扩大了磁器在工业和建筑上的应用。以往磁器在工业和建筑上的应用只限于输电用磁，卫生用磁和磁砖等。现在扩大到鼓风机，抽水机，造纸机，水泵，广播喇叭筒，暖气片，酒精蒸馏塔，练泥机以及滚珠轴承等，不但完成“以磁代钢”，节约钢材的任务，并且支援了钢铁的生产。
    虽然这两个轻工业都能为国家赢得相当的外汇，值得我们的重视，但如前已说明，以上只是借我亲身所体验到的这两个轻工业大跃进来说明一九五八年我国各项工业以及国民经济各方面的大跃进。这种大跃进，只有在总路线的照耀下，贯彻党的领导，执行群众路线，政治挂帅，充分发挥领导干部、技术人员、工人群众的积极性和创造性，才能实现。
    正如周总理在报告中所指出：“技术革新和技术革命的可能性是无限的。”为了一九五九年的继续大跃进，仍然要根据“洋土结合”的方针，大闹技术革命，努力改进工具设备和操作方法。例如漆的天然干燥太慢，使漆器成品的时间太长，影响资金的周转，假如能像烘干汽车外壳漆一样，用红外线光来加速漆的干燥，就可大大缩短漆器成品的时间，某汽车制造专家也认为这是切实可行的。又如制磁坯的机器还可大大地改进，并成为一种半自动化的流水作业方法，使劳动生产率更加提高。
    此外，景德镇磁业的发展尚存在一些困难，亟待解决。例如，高级磁器仍需木材烧窑，不能用煤，而木材又需汽车从相当远的地方运来，而且木材也越来越少，因此，全改用煤是必要的。景德镇的原动力供不应求，电力既不够，其它机器如柴油机又不易买到，致使某一磁厂的练泥机不能转动，而练泥仍须部分用手工操作的很慢的土法。希望有关机关能加以研究，早日解决，使景德镇的磁业在一九五九年能有更大的跃进。
    总之，从这两个轻工业的例子看来，我国国民经济一九五八年大跃进的成就是辉煌的，一九五九年继续大跃进的前景是美好的；但也是有相当困难的。我们应当在党的领导下，政治挂帅，发动群众，大闹技术革命，为实现一九五九年的继续大跃进而奋斗！
