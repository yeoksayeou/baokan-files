Let's not mention Princess Wencheng's matrimonial ties,
Let's not mention Princess Jincheng's cultural contributions,
Let's not mention the qin, se, pipa in the Jokhang Temple,¹
Let's not mention the golden cup tales between nephew and uncle,²
Let's just talk about the 'Phags-pa of seven hundred years ago.
It was he, as Imperial Preceptor, who went to Beijing to spread Buddhism;
It was he who was enfeoffed, governing 130,000 households. ³
The name "Tibet" was established from then on,
And it was included in our country's administrative divisions from then on.

Let's look again at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty,
When the Karma Kagyu's Manjushri was appointed as Imperial Preceptor,
As Diligent Duke, as Grand Situ,
Governing the three parts and 130,000 households of Tibet.
His descendants inherited his steps,
Receiving the jade books and golden seals from the court generation after generation.
The Elucidation King established a stronghold in the Western lands,
The Empowerment Guru spread the milk of the Dharma.⁴
Countless are the historical anecdotes of the Ming Dynasty.

Two great scholars promoted Tsongkhapa,
Golden books and golden seals were presented to the Dalai Lama,
And the Panchen Erdeni jointly presided over religious affairs.⁵
The Kangxi Emperor established the Kalon; the Qianlong Emperor established the Kashag;⁶
Conferred the Golden Urn; ⁷
Cast the Zhangka coin;⁸
Increased the military quota;⁹
Equalized the Ula corvée;¹⁰
Detailed planning was made for local military and political affairs.

Sent a large army to repel the invading Gurkha troops,?
Protecting the motherland's borders,
Also protecting the Potala Palace,
The Tibetan people, the people of the whole country,
Are as close as flesh and blood, a family.

The history of the past does not allow for fabrication,
The facts of today do not allow for slander.
Who doesn't know our unprecedented unity of all ethnic groups?
Who doesn't know that our religious freedom is earnestly implemented?
Who doesn't know that the people of the whole country support Tibet's construction?
Who doesn't know the Tibetan compatriots' gratitude to the Communist Party?
Chairman Mao's kindness,
Is as evergreen as pine and cypress, as inexhaustible as rivers!

To attempt to separate Tibet from the motherland,
Is nothing but a futile effort,
Courting self-destruction.

What's the use of saying "Tibetans are different from Han people"?
It's like saying Tamils and Assamese are different from Hindi speakers.
Does that prevent them from living in the same India?
Is that a reason to change the map?
Isn't this the same trick as the British imperialist conspiracy?
Hypocritically raising the smokescreen of ethnicity and religion,
What you sympathize with are national scum and religious traitors.

As a Buddhist,
I want to accuse,
Those who kill, steal, commit adultery, lie, do all kinds of evil, destroy religious rules, and insult monks,
Are precisely that small group of big serf owners who insist on dark rule.

Slander cannot damage the reputation of the sun and moon;
Shouting cannot interfere with the language of wind and thunder;
Conspiratorial activities cannot stop the Chinese people from advancing.

The Himalayas are dancing with colorful flower rain;
The Yarlung Tsangpo River is singing joyous songs;
The Tibetan people have won paradise,
Away from hell,
Abandoning a small pile of garbage for the demons to pick up.

Respectable gentlemen,
Go ahead and grieve and cry for your darlings,
But their good times are gone forever,
Leaving you with nothing,
But ah: "Helplessly, flowers fade away!"

¹ The Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, built by Princess Wencheng, houses Tang Dynasty musical instruments.
² Legend says that the son of Princess Jincheng was taken by another concubine. The Tibetan king hosted a banquet for the relatives of both families, and handed a golden cup to the three-year-old prince to toast his maternal uncle, in order to identify his biological mother. The prince gave the golden cup to a Han person, saying: "I am a Han nephew."
³ In 1269, 'Phags-pa went to Beijing and was enfeoffed by Emperor Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty to administer the 130,000 households in Tibet.
⁴ After the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, successive Tibetan kings were enfeoffed as "Elucidation Kings," and some were concurrently enfeoffed as "Empowerment Gurus."
⁵ In 1652, the Fifth Dalai Lama went to Beijing and was enfeoffed by Emperor Shunzhi of the Qing Dynasty as "The Dalai Lama, All-Knowing Vajradhara, the Great Benevolent Buddha of the Western Paradise, Leader of the Buddhist Faith Under Heaven." In 1713, the Fifth Panchen was enfeoffed by Emperor Kangxi as "Panchen Erdeni."
⁶ The Kangxi Emperor established the Kalon official position, and the Qianlong Emperor established the Kashag as the local administrative organ of Tibet, under the leadership of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and the Amban. It had four Kalons, stipulated as one monk and three laymen.
⁷ When multiple reincarnated "living Buddhas" of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama are found at the same time, it is stipulated that their names be written and placed in the golden urn bestowed by the Qing Emperor, and lots are drawn in front of the Buddha to decide.
⁸ Zhangka is the name of the Tibetan currency, stipulated as one tael of silver and five li per Zhangka.
⁹ During the Qianlong period, the regular Tibetan local army was established, with the establishment increased to 3,000 troops, to strengthen border defense.
¹⁰ Ula is the system of corvée labor in Tibet. In the past, the general poor people bore a heavy burden, while nobles and wealthy families could be exempted from corvée. During the Qianlong period, exemption licenses were revoked, and it was stipulated that corvée labor should be evenly distributed. The above are all systems established by the central government for Tibet during the Qianlong period.
? In 1791, the Gurkhas invaded Tibet. The Qing government accepted the request of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama and sent a large army to drive out the invaders.

    无可奈何花落去
    ——告所谓“同情西藏”的先生们
    赵朴初
    且不提文成公主结成的姻娅，
    且不提金城公主传播的文化，
    且不提大昭寺的琴瑟琵琶，①
    且不提甥舅间的金杯佳话，②
    只谈七百年前的八思巴。
    是他，当国师，到北京宣扬佛化；
    是他，受册封，十三万户归他管辖。
    ③西藏的名儿从此定下，
    从此列入了我国的行政区划。
    再看一看明朝开国之初，
    曾经册封噶举派的曼殊为国师，
    为勤国公，为大司徒，
    统御西藏三部十三万户。
    他的后人继承了他的步武，
    代代受了朝廷的玉册金符。
    阐化王屏藩着西土，
    灌顶国师流传着法乳。④
    数不完有明一代的掌故。
    两大士绍隆了宗喀巴，
    金册金印赠封了达赖喇嘛，
    和班禅额尔德尼同掌教化。⑤
    康熙设置了噶伦；乾隆成立了噶厦；⑥
    赐金瓶； ⑦
    铸章卡；⑧
    增兵额；⑨
    均乌拉；⑩
    地方军政有了详细的规划。
    派大军击退了廓尔喀入侵的兵马，?
    保卫祖国边疆，
    也就保卫了布达拉，
    西藏人民，全国人民，
    骨肉相连是一家。
    过去的历史不容许胡扯，
    今天的事实更不容诬蔑。
    谁不知道我们各民族空前的团结？
    谁不知道我们宗教自由认真贯彻？
    谁不知道全国人民支援着西藏建设？
    谁不知道西藏同胞对共产党的感谢？
    毛主席的恩情，
    松柏长青，江河不竭！
    妄想把西藏从祖国分裂，
    无非是枉费心机，
    自取毁灭。
    说“西藏人不同于汉人”有什么用处？
    正如说塔米尔人、阿萨姆人不同于印地族。
    难道这就会阻止他们同住在一个印度？
    难道这就是理由要改变版图？
    难道这不是英国人侵略阴谋的依样葫芦？
    假惺惺还张起民族和宗教的烟幕，
    你们同情的原来是民族败类、宗教叛徒。
    作为一个佛教徒，
    我要控诉，
    杀盗淫妄、无恶不作、破坏教规、污辱僧徒，
    正是那一小撮坚持黑暗统治的大农奴主。
    诽谤损伤不了日月的名誉；
    叫嚣干扰不了风雷的言语；
    阴谋活动阻挡不了中国人民前进的道路。
    喜马拉雅山飞舞着缤纷的花雨；
    雅鲁藏布江高唱着欢乐的歌曲；
    西藏人民赢得了天堂，
    远离了地狱，
    抛弃了一小撮垃圾让魔鬼捡取。
    可敬的先生们，
    尽管为你们的宝贝们悲伤哭泣吧，
    只是他们的美景良辰一去不复返了，
    剩下给你们的，
    不过是啊：“无可奈何花落去”！
    ①拉萨大昭寺，文成公主所建，藏有唐代乐器。
    ②相传金城公主所生之子，为另一王妃所夺，藏王宴请两家亲戚，以金杯交给三岁的王子向母舅敬酒，借以识别生母是谁。王子将金杯交与汉人，说：“我是汉甥。”
    ③1269年八思巴到北京，受元世祖册封管理西藏十三万户地方。
    ④明永乐以后，代代藏王均受册封为“阐化王”，有的兼封为“灌顶国师”。
    ⑤1652年五世达赖到北京，受清顺治帝册封为“西天大善自在佛所领天下释教普通瓦赤喇怛喇达赖喇嘛”。1713年五世班禅受康熙帝册封为“班禅额尔德尼”。
    ⑥康熙始设噶伦官职，乾隆设立噶厦，作为西藏地方行政机关，受达赖、班禅和驻藏大臣的领导，内设噶伦四人，规定一僧三俗。
    ⑦达赖、班禅“转生”的灵童，同时找到数人时，规定将名字写置清帝所赐金瓶内，在佛前抽签决定。
    ⑧章卡是西藏币名，规定每一章卡银一分五厘。
    ⑨乾隆时成立西藏地方正规军，编制增至三千名，以加强边防。
    ⑩乌拉是西藏人民服劳役的制度，过去一般贫苦人民负担苛重，而贵族豪家可以免役，乾隆时收回免役执照，规定平均负担差役。以上均是乾隆时中央政府为西藏地方所订的制度。
    ?1791年廓尔喀人侵入西藏，清政府接受了达赖、班禅两人的请求，派大军前往将侵略者驱出。
