What is "Road Maintenance"?

"Road maintenance" is the abbreviation for road maintenance. After a road is built, it is continuously worn and eroded by vehicles, livestock, and other traffic, as well as by sun, rain, wind, and freezing. To maintain the flatness of the road surface and the integrity of bridges, culverts, and other equipment, it is necessary to improve the technical condition of the original road in a planned and systematic way, and gradually improve the quality of use, so that traffic always remains smooth. This work is called "road maintenance." Road maintenance is an important task, and we should ensure that every road we build is well maintained.

　　什么叫“养路”？
    “养路”是养护公路的简称。当公路修成后，在使用过程中，由于各种车辆、牲畜等不断通过，再加上日晒、雨淋、风吹、冰冻，使公路不断受到磨损、侵蚀。为了维护公路路面的平直和桥梁、涵洞等设备的完好，必须有计划有系统地改善原有公路的技术状况，逐步提高使用质量，使得行车永远保持通畅。这个工作就叫“养路”。养路是一项重要工作，应该做到修好一条，就养好一条。
