　　Jiangxi Random Verses
　　by Xie Juezai
　　The August 1st Bridge and August 1st Avenue in Nanchang
　　The August 1st Bridge connects the August 1st Avenue,
　　The bridge is as flat as a whetstone, the avenue like a field,
　　Four rows of flowers and trees, three lanes for roads,
　　Roads and gardens, this is the pioneer.
　　Jinggang Mountain
　　Jinggang Mountain, ah!
　　You are a lighthouse,
　　Illuminating the path forward for hundreds of millions of people;
　　You are a giant thunderbolt, destroying the two great mountains weighing on the shoulders of hundreds of millions of people.
　　Fire! What a great fire,
　　It spreads all over the country, reaching boundless overseas and the sky.
　　A prairie fire starts from a single spark!
　　Dajing, Dalong, Ciping, Maoping, Wangyangjie, Bamianshan, Zhushachong...
　　That is where these lovely and great sparks reside.
　　The fire of truth will forever illuminate the human mind, creating an infinitely beautiful future.
　　Jinggang Mountain, ah!
　　You are also a pearl, you contain endless wealth,
　　Many outstanding sons and daughters rush into your embrace to decorate you in a modern way,
　　Making you the number one mountain in China.
　　Jinggang Mountain, ah!
　　Congratulations to you for being the number one mountain in China in the past,
　　And for always being the number one mountain in China in the future.
　　Watching a Rural People's Commune Entertainment Performance
　　Some recite poetry like a play,
　　Some perform plays like poetry,
　　Labor dances combined with literary language,
　　Spring comes, and everywhere are tea-picking songs.
　　Passing Through Ji'an
　　Last year's bumper harvest left surplus grain,
　　Still need to increase production of fish, vegetables, and pigs,
　　This year, for the sake of field consolidation,
　　One harvest must yield two crops of rice.
　　Visiting the Cloud People's Commune in Lushan
　　No worries about living, travel, clothing, and food,
　　Fixed schedule for both physical and mental labor,
　　I am for everyone, and everyone is for me,
　　Originally, life was in the clouds.
　　Climbing Lushan Mountain
　　Climbing the mountain, the winding road is like a rope,
　　Colorful ropes tie down precious pearls,
　　Exquisite carvings, suspected to be the work of gods.
　　Red buildings and green tiles cover the peaks and valleys,
　　Sometimes flying chariots replace ascending and descending, (1)
　　Not a Buddhist temple, but a people's palace.
　　A bridge cuts off thousands of valleys of water,
　　Accumulating into a lake several meters deep,
　　And there is even a pavilion in the heart of the lake.
　　Planning to drive away the mist on the top of the peak,
　　Artificial rain has already been successfully tested. (2)
　　Agriculture, industry, mining, animal husbandry, and fishing are all flourishing,
　　Fir, pine, camphor, tea, and fruits compete to flourish.
　　Everyone subdues dragons and tigers,
　　Every commune has good flowers and bumper harvests.
　　Western tourists sigh in vain,
　　The immortals in the cave blink their eyes.
　　(1) Refers to automobiles
　　(2) Comrades of the Lushan Administration Bureau said: Last year, there was an artificial rain, and the effect was good. There is also a way to dispel the fog on the mountain.
　　Visiting Jingdezhen
　　Every process is meticulous and precise,
　　Shaping and painting, the art is outstanding,
　　Only then do I know that ordinary daily necessities,
　　Once cost the workers infinite effort;
　　The style of the four similarities is passed down from ancient times, (1)
　　The wheels carry fame across the oceans,
　　The porcelain capital's leap forward is just beginning now,
　　Both quantity and quality need to be doubled. (1)
　　Jingdezhen porcelain style:
　　As white as jade, as thin as paper, as bright as a mirror, and its sound like a chime.
　　Bees Going to the Countryside (1)
　　A million new honeycomb foundations have been added, (2)
　　Hundreds of billions of offspring need to be housed,
　　Spring comes, and fragrant and beautiful flowers bloom together,
　　Laboring bees also go to the countryside.
　　(1) On March 18th, I inspected the Jiangxi Province Disabled Servicemen's Sanatorium. The sanatorium raises many bees, and now the beehives are distributed to various places to collect flowers. Some have already reached the border of Hunan. They said, "Bees are going to the countryside."
　　(2) A honeycomb base made of wax and paper, called a honeycomb foundation, reduces the work of the bees. Buying honeycomb foundations from outside costs four or five yuan per sheet, while making them yourself only costs one or two yuan.
　　Leaving Nanchang with a Farewell Poem
　　Cement replaces iron, porcelain replaces steel,
　　Half of the machine workers are women.
　　Technical skills are constantly improving,
　　Although the number of personnel is small, it doesn't matter.
　　Breaking through five barriers and advancing together,
　　Four marshals take the stage, and ten thousand horses are strong.
　　Looking south at Ruijin and north at Guling,
　　The red glow fills the sky, a rising sun.

　　江西杂咏
　　谢觉哉
　　南昌八一桥和八一道
    八一桥联八一道，
    桥平如砥道如田，
    四行花木三行路，
    道路园林此是先。
    井冈山
    井冈山呵！
    你是个灯塔，
    照亮着亿万人民前进的道路；
    你是个巨雷，摧毁了压在亿万人民肩上的两架大山。
    火！好大的火，
    她燎遍全国，燎向无边的海外和天空。
    燎原之火，起于星星！
    大井、大垅、茨坪、茅坪、汪洋界、八面山、朱砂冲……
    就是这可爱的伟大的星星所在。
    真理的火，永远照亮着人类的心灵，创造着无穷美好的未来。
    井冈山呵！
    你又是颗珍珠，你蕴蓄着无穷财富，
    许多优秀的儿女奔扑你的怀抱要把你现代化地装饰起来，
    成为中国的第一山。
    井冈山呵！
    祝贺你以前是中国的第一山，
    今后永远是中国的第一山。
　　看农村公社文娱会演
　　几人诵诗诗似剧，
　　几人演剧剧如诗，
    劳动舞加文学语，
　　春来遍是采茶歌。
    过吉安
　　去岁丰登谷有余，
    尚须增产鱼蔬猪，
    今年为着田休整，
    一造须收两造禾。
　　访问庐山云中人民公社
    住行衣食无忧虑，
    体脑勤劳有定程，
　　我为人人人为我，
    本来生活在云中。
    上庐山
　　登山环山路如绳，
    彩绳系定珍珠珍，
    精雕细镂疑神工。
    红楼碧瓦遍巅谷，
    时有飞辇代降升，（一）
    不是梵宫是人宫。
    一桥截断千谷水，
    潴蓄成湖念米深，
    翼然还有湖心亭。
    拟驱峰顶雾迷惘，
    已经试制雨成功。（二）
    农工矿牧渔全盛，
　　杉松樟茶果竞荣。
    人人降龙又伏虎，
    社社花好并年丰。
    西来游客空叹息，
    洞里仙人眨眼睛。
  （一）指汽车
  （二）庐山管理局同志说：去年下了一次人工雨效果还好，山上的雾也有法子把它驱散。
    游景德镇
　　道道工序细且精，
　　塑形绘影艺超群，
　　才知日用寻常品，
　　曾费工人无限心；
　　风格四如传古代，（一）
　　车轮载誉越重瀛，
　　磁都跃进今方始，
　　量质都需加倍成。（一）
　　景德镇瓷器风格：
　　白如玉、薄如纸、明如镜、声如磬。
    蜂儿下乡（一）
　　巢础新添百万张，（二）

　　春来香艳花齐放，
　　劳动蜂儿也下乡。
　　（一）3月18日视察江西省残废军人教养院，教养院养蜂很多，现把蜂箱分到各地采花，一部已到湖南边界，他们说“蜂儿下乡”。
　　（二）以蜡和纸印成蜂巢底子名巢础，减少蜂儿工作。巢础向外买进要四、五元一张，自造只费一、二元。
    离南昌留题
　　水泥代铁磁代钢，
　　机械工人半女郎。
　　技术拔尖尖不已，
　　人员虽少少无妨。
　　五关突破齐头进，
　　四帅登场万马强。
　　南望瑞金北牯岭，
　　漫天红艳正朝阳。
