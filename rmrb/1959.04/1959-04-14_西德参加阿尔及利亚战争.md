　　West Germany Participates in the Algerian War
　　Ya. Aitinge'er
    West Germany directly participated in the colonial war in Algeria. First, Bonn financially supported France's military operations in Algeria. According to a report in the Cologne newspaper "Vorwärts" on April 18, 1958, West German Defense Minister Strauss admitted in response to an inquiry in the Bundestag that from January 1 to April 1958, France received more than one billion marks from West Germany, of which 630 million marks were directly used for the Algerian War. The "Bavarian Review," published in Dortmund on April 21, 1958, emphasized the great significance of Bonn's financial support to Paris. The newspaper said: "Due to the huge expenses of the Algerian War, France's national finances have long been on the verge of bankruptcy. However, if Paris has been able to avoid financial collapse until now, it is primarily because the Federal Republic of Germany has given it a large amount of money. In other words, the Federal Republic of Germany is subsidizing the Algerian War."
    Second, West Germany also sent weapons and ammunition to Algeria. In the first quarter of 1957 alone, France received 26 million francs worth of military supplies from the Federal Republic of Germany for the Algerian War.
    Furthermore, Bonn also provided the French command with cadres to conduct this colonial war. Many former SS members and Wehrmacht officers who had not been employed by the Federal Armed Forces were recruited into the French Foreign Legion (the shock troops of the colonial army). According to materials published by the German Unification Issues Committee in September 1958, the total number of Germans incorporated into this legion after the war exceeded 400,000. Recruitment offices were located in Strasbourg and Metz, from where these legionnaires were sent to Algeria. According to a report in the Hamburg newspaper "Die Welt" on December 2, 1958, approximately 70% of the soldiers and officers in the Foreign Legion in Algeria were of West German origin. There were also many West German mercenaries in the French parachute units.
    It can be said with certainty that Bonn intends to send regular troops of the Federal Armed Forces to Algeria. In particular, there is a plan to use West German troops under the command of NATO in this colonial war. According to a report in the "Frankfurter Rundschau" on February 2, 1959, this issue was discussed during Strauss's visit to Paris in January 1959.
    The Bonn regime, which supports French colonialists, also extradites Algerian patriots. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany does not recognize Algerians as political exiles and persecutes them.
    What are the reasons for the Federal Republic of Germany's practical participation in the Algerian War? Obviously, it is not trying to pull chestnuts out of the fire for France; the ruling groups in West Germany are acting out of their own imperialist interests. They fear the victory of the national liberation movement of the African people, because this will threaten the positions of West German monopoly capital in Africa.
    The resources of Algeria, especially the oil and iron ore discovered in the Saharan part of Algeria, are eagerly sought by Ruhr concerns. The ruling groups in Bonn believe that maintaining France's military and political control over Algeria can safeguard the positions of West German capital there. Bonn's militarists also take into account the strategic position of Algeria. In November 1957, Chief of Staff of the Federal Armed Forces Heusinger emphasized in a speech in Hamburg the need to "maintain control over Algeria, which is of decisive importance to the strategy of NATO."
    Algeria has become a place for West Germany to train its air force units. This air force is part of NATO's armed forces. Recently, senior officers of the Federal Armed Forces have frequently visited Algeria.
    It is quite clear that Bonn's policy towards Algeria exposes the myth of the Federal Republic of Germany's "anti-colonial policy" in Asia and Africa. This deepens the gap between West Germany and the awakened East. Therefore, some people in West Germany are very dissatisfied with this policy. Under public pressure, in January 1959, a question was raised in the West German parliament about the Federal Republic of Germany's covert participation in the Algerian War. However, the members of the ruling Christian Democratic Union considered it inappropriate to discuss this issue and overturned the proposal.

### 西德参加阿尔及利亚战争

　　西德参加阿尔及利亚战争
　　雅·艾廷格尔
    西德直接参加了阿尔及利亚的殖民战争。首先，波恩以金钱资助法国在阿尔及利亚的军事行动。据1958年4月18日科隆的“前进报”报道，德意志联邦共和国国防部长施特劳斯在国会答复质询时承认，从1958年1月1日到4月，法国从西德得到了十亿以上马克的巨款，其中有六亿三千万马克被直接用于阿尔及利亚战争。1958年4月21日在多特蒙德出版的一期“巴伐利亚评论报”，强调了波恩的财政支援对巴黎的重大意义。这家报纸说：“由于阿尔及利亚战争的庞大开支，法国的国家财政早已濒于破产的境地。然而，如果说直到现在巴黎居然能够免于财政上的崩溃，那末这首先是因为德意志联邦共和国给了它大批的款子。换句话说，就是德意志联邦共和国在资助阿尔及利亚战争。”
    其次，西德还把武器和弹药送到阿尔及利亚去。仅1957年第一季度，法国为了进行阿尔及利亚战争而从德意志联邦共和国得到的军需物资就达二千六百万法郎。
    再有，波恩还向法国统帅部提供进行这场殖民战争的干部。联邦部队尚未采用的许多前党卫军分子和国防军军官，被召募到法国的外籍军团（殖民军队的突击部队）里去。据1958年9月德国统一问题委员会发表的材料，战后被编入这一军团的德国人总共达四十万以上。在斯特拉斯堡和美茨设有招兵处，从那里把这些参加军团的分子送到阿尔及利亚去。据1958年12月2日汉堡的“世界报”消息，在阿尔及利亚的外籍军团中大约70％的士兵和军官是西德出身的。法国的伞兵部队中也有不少的西德籍雇佣兵。
    可以有把握地说，波恩打算把联邦部队的正规军派到阿尔及利亚去。特别是有一个在这场殖民战争中使用由北大西洋公约组织统辖的西德军队的计划。据1959年2月2日“法兰克福评论报”报道，在1959年1月施特劳斯访问巴黎期间曾讨论过这个问题。
    支持法国殖民者的波恩政权，还向他们引渡阿尔及利亚爱国者。德意志联邦共和国政府，不承认阿尔及利亚人是政治流亡者，而加以迫害。
    德意志联邦共和国实地参加阿尔及利亚战争的原因何在呢？显然，它不是想替法国火中取栗；西德的统治集团是从自己的帝国主义利益出发的。他们害怕非洲人民民族解放运动的胜利，因为这会威胁西德垅断资本在非洲的阵地。
    阿尔及利亚的富源，特别是阿尔及利亚境内撒哈拉部分已发现的石油和铁矿，鲁尔的康采恩急欲染指。波恩的统治集团认为，维持法国在军事政治上对阿尔及利亚的控制，可以保障西德资本在那里的阵地。波恩军国主义者还考虑到阿尔及利亚的战略地位。1957年11月，联邦部队参谋长豪辛格在汉堡讲话时曾强调必须“保持对阿尔及利亚的控制，这对北大西洋公约组织的战略具有决定性作用”。
    阿尔及利亚成了西德训练空军部队的地方。这个空军部队，是北大西洋公约组织武装力量的组成部分。近来，联邦部队的高级军官频频访问阿尔及利亚。
    十分明显，波恩对阿尔及利亚的政策，戳穿了德意志联邦共和国在亚非的“反殖民主义政策”的神话。这加深了西德和觉醒了的东方之间的鸿沟。因此，西德某些人士对于这种政策很不满。在舆论的压力下，1959年1月在西德议会里曾提出了有关德意志联邦共和国暗中参加阿尔及利亚战争的问题。但是，执政的基督教民主联盟的议员，认为讨论这个问题不合时宜而推翻了这个提案。
