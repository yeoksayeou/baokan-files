    The Mystery of the Shells
    Tian Ma
    In the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," it says, "On March 17, mortar shells were fired at the Norbulingka Palace, two or three of them. Fortunately, the shells all landed in a nearby pond."
    Nehru said, "...according to the statement (referring to the so-called Dalai Lama's statement), those shells or something landed on his palace..."
    The pond and the palace,
    Not very far apart,
    One day they chatted,
    Exchanging pleasantries.
    The palace spoke first:
    "Old friend, you're in danger,
    I heard that at your home,
    Three shells landed there."
    The pond, hearing this,
    Stared with both eyes:
    "Old friend, you jest,
    Your words are careless.
    My home is safe and sound,
    No shells have landed here.
    But I did hear tell,
    Your home met disaster.
    Said you were unlucky,
    Hit by a shell;
    Or some such thing,
    Landed on you there."
    The palace chuckled:
    "That's utter nonsense,
    Your eyes aren't blind,
    Can't you see I'm whole?
    What strange thing is this,
    So mysterious and vague?
    You can't see it,
    Nor can you hear it!"
    After this conversation,
    Both felt relieved:
    Shells and other things,
    Were all made up!

    炮弹之谜
    天马
    在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”里说，“3月17日，迫击炮朝着罗布林卡宫打了两三炮。幸而炮弹都落到附近的一个池塘里去了。”
    尼赫鲁说，“……据声明（按即所谓达赖喇嘛的声明）说那些炮弹或者什么东西落在他的宫殿上……”
    池塘和宫殿，
    相距不很远，
    有天把话拉，
    互相问寒暖。
    宫殿先说话：
    “老兄可危险，
    听说你的家，
    落下三炮弹”。
    池塘听此言，
    瞪起一双眼：
    “老兄开玩笑，
    说话失检点。
    我家很平安，
    从未落炮弹。
    倒是我听说，
    你家遭灾难。
    说你运不好，
    身上中炮弹；
    或者啥东西，
    落在你上面。”
    宫殿打哈哈：
    这是胡扯淡，
    你眼又不瞎，
    看我可健全？
    什么怪东西，
    那样玄又玄？
    看又看不到，
    听又听不见！”
    说完一席话，
    彼此心放宽：
    炮弹及其他，
    原来是胡编！
