"Tall Tales" and Reality
By Our Correspondent Su Lan

Three Big "Tall Tales"

On April 6th, the British government released its budget report for the next fiscal year. Many bourgeois newspapers lauded it as a "prosperity budget." A few days prior, the economic white paper, published in preparation for this budget, also emphasized that since 1959, Britain's economic situation had become much stronger than a year ago.

Faced with a general election, the Conservative government, through these two documents, gives the impression that "a pleasant economic outlook seems to have emerged."

The British government is boasting and asserting that the economy will "improve" this year based on nothing more than three points: First, industrial production has shown signs of rising; second, in terms of trade balance of payments, it has reversed the previous deficit and has a large surplus; third, the pound has never been so "strong," and gold, dollars, and foreign exchange reserves have reached a record high.

Distorted "Recovery"

It is true that in the fourth quarter of last year and in January of this year, British industrial production had a slight rebound. For example, the production index for August, September, and October of last year was 105 (with 1954 as 100), while November, December, and January all rose to 107. However, if we understand the true situation of each industrial sector, we can see that this rise is distorted. The industries with a slight increase in production are automobiles, food, tobacco, and alcohol; on the other hand, the production of steel, coal, aircraft, shipbuilding, construction, and other industries continues to decline. Orders for machine tools are only half of what they were a year ago. This shows that the new increase in the production of consumer goods is accompanied by a serious decline in the production of means of production. In other words, this partial recovery has not stimulated investment in industry.

It is said that the increase in the production of consumer goods is the result of increased consumer demand. However, it is difficult to believe that consumer demand would increase in a situation of wage freezes, rising prices, increasing unemployment, and declining purchasing power. In the final analysis, this "increase" must be "attributed" to the several relaxations of bank credit and the abolition of installment payment restrictions. The British government is using the method of expanding people's debt to "activate" the domestic retail market, thereby stimulating the production of consumer goods. This did play a role in the fourth quarter of last year. According to official statistics, installment loan borrowing increased by 89 million pounds in the fourth quarter of last year, and bank withdrawals by individuals and businesses increased by 50 million pounds. As a result, consumer spending increased by 3% in the fourth quarter of last year, reaching the highest level since 1954. Retail sales of many durable consumer goods, such as automobiles, refrigerators, televisions, and furniture, have increased significantly.

However, the increase in the production of consumer goods has not increased the index of overall industrial production. From the third quarter of 1957 to the third quarter of 1958, British industrial output fell by a full 3%. Even with the addition of some of the production increases in the fourth quarter of last year, the overall production index for 1958 was still 1% lower than in 1957.

It should be particularly pointed out that the relaxation of bank credit and the abolition of installment purchase restrictions, such artificial measures, will not fundamentally improve production. The British magazine "Economic Review" admits that these two measures "have only a temporary impact on the economy." "If sales are to be maintained at the current level, the total amount of consumer debt must continue to increase." However, at present, consumers are already heavily indebted, and this rise in false purchasing power has reached a saturation point. The burden of debt is overwhelming. Therefore, it is already very difficult to further expand people's debt. In January of this year, installment purchase debt increased by only 19 million pounds, indicating that consumer spending has slowed down. By February of this year, the index of overall industrial production had fallen slightly compared to January. This is the result of a decline in retail trade. If the Conservative government does not take "new measures," consumer spending will inevitably continue to decline. From this point of view, artificial stimulation can only make the development of capitalist production more and more unbalanced, and cannot help to fundamentally improve production.

"Robber-like" Surplus

The British government's second "tall tale" is even more shameful. Everyone knows that Britain has a deficit in its foreign trade of goods every year, but in 1958, it actually had a surplus of 120 million pounds. This is not the result of a large increase in exports; on the contrary, British exports fell by 3.5% last year. The fact is that Britain has shifted the burden of the crisis onto the shoulders of raw material producing countries. In the past year, Britain made a fortune due to the fall in raw material prices in the capitalist world. The white paper frankly admits that the average price of imports from foreign countries fell by 8%, while the price of exports from Britain fell by only 1%. In this way, Britain gained 7% for nothing. Therefore, the British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" calls this balance of payments surplus a "robber-like surplus."

This trade surplus means a great strengthening of exploitation of backward countries. Most backward countries and British colonies have suffered significant losses due to the fall in raw material prices. This is not absolutely beneficial to Britain itself. These countries, due to the decline in purchasing power, have had to reduce or restrict imports; Commonwealth countries and other countries in the Sterling Area, in order to make up for the trade deficit, have withdrawn their Sterling deposits from the City of London in large quantities (82 million pounds in 1958). This cannot but have a reverse impact on Britain itself. It is already very difficult for Britain to maintain such a large trade surplus in the future. Since the fourth quarter of last year, Britain's exports to the Sterling Area (especially raw material producing countries) have fallen sharply. Therefore, in terms of trade of goods, Britain's surplus in the first half of last year was 141 million pounds, but in the second half of the year, there was a deficit of 20 million pounds.

Reserves Appear Strong but are Weak Inside

The balance of payments surplus is the main reason for the increase in Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves. By March of this year, Britain's gold, dollars, and other foreign exchange reserves amounted to approximately 1.121 billion pounds. Judging from this figure alone, it seems that Britain's reserves have indeed "improved." However, it is very difficult for Britain to continue to maintain this high level of reserves. First of all, the 200 million pounds that it borrowed from the International Monetary Fund during the Suez adventure will be repaid for the first time this year, totaling 71 million pounds. Secondly, Britain must also pay 98 million pounds in gold for the new share of the International Monetary Fund. Thus, the total is 169 million pounds. In addition, the annual overseas military expenditure of approximately 216 million pounds and other debts that need to be repaid must be taken from these reserves. At the same time, it is impossible for the balance of payments surplus to increase significantly in the future. Therefore, Britain's reserves are not only unstable, but also likely to decline.

New "Stimulant"

Of course, the British government is fully aware that its economic situation has not really improved. Precisely because of this, it must seek a new "stimulant" to "promote" production after the measures of relaxing credit and encouraging hire purchase have failed.

According to the budget report, the new measures that the British government will take are: 1. Investment subsidies: Immediate restoration of investment subsidies for capital consumption. The investment subsidy rate for new factories and new equipment is 20%, and the investment subsidy rate for the construction of industrial buildings is 10%. The first batch of subsidies for the former is 10%, and the first batch of subsidies for the latter is 5%. 2. In the next fiscal year, reduce income tax by 229 million pounds and reduce purchase tax by 81.25 million pounds.

It is quite obvious that this budget, in addition to wanting to lure some voters to vote for the Conservative Party in the next general election, mainly wants to encourage private investment and expand people's consumer spending through tax cuts, thereby curbing the downward trend in industrial production. However, even the bourgeois newspapers believe that cutting more than 300 million pounds in taxes will not have a significant effect. The "Manchester Guardian" pointed out: "These concessions in taxation are not enough to promote a major development of the economy."

    “法螺”与现实
    本报记者　苏蓝
    三大“法螺”
    4月6日，英国政府发表了下一财政年度的预算报告，许多资产阶级报纸，都把它吹嘘成为“繁荣的预算”。而几天之前，为此预算作准备所发表的经济白皮书，也强调指出：从1959年开始，英国的经济情况比一年以前强得多了。
    面临大选的保守党政府，通过这两个文件，给人这样一种印象：“一个愉快的经济前景似乎出现了。”
    英国政府大吹法螺，并断定今年经济将会“好转”的根据，不外三点：第一、工业生产已经有了上升的迹象；第二、在贸易支付平衡方面，竟一变过去入超现象而大有结余；第三、英镑从来没有这么“硬”过，黄金、美元和外汇储备达到最高纪录。
    畸形的“回升”
    不错，在去年第四季度和今年1月，英国的工业生产有了一点回升。例如，去年8、9、10月份的生产指数是一零五（以1954年为一百），而11月、12月和今年1月都上升到一零七。但如果了解一下各个工业部门的真实情况，就可以看出，这样上升的现象是畸形的。生产略有上升的工业是：汽车、食品、烟酒等；而另一方面，钢、煤、飞机、造船、建筑工业等的生产则继续下降。工作母机的订货，只等于一年前的一半。这说明，消费资料生产的新的增加，伴随着生产资料生产的严重下降。也就是说，这种局部的回升，丝毫没有刺激起工业方面的投资。
    据说，消费资料生产的上升，是消费需求增加的结果。但是，人们很难相信，在工资冻结、物价上涨、失业增加、人民购买力日益下降的情况下，消费的需求会有增加。归根结蒂，这种“增加”不能不“归功”于银行信贷的数次放宽以及分期付款限制的取消。英国政府以扩大人民债务的办法，来“活跃”国内零售市场，从而刺激消费品的生产。这在去年第四季度的确起了一些作用。据官方统计，去年第四季度分期付款的借贷增加了八千九百万英镑，而个人和企业的银行提款增加了五千万英镑。结果是：去年第四季度的消费支出增加了3％，达到1954年以来的最高水平。许多耐用消费品，如汽车、冰箱、电视机、家具等的零售额都大有增加。
    但消费品生产的上升，并没有使整个工业生产的指数增加。从1957年第三季度到1958年第三季度，英国工业产量整整下跌了3％。即使加上去年第四季度生产的某些上涨，整个1958年的生产指数仍比1957年低1％。
    特别应该指出的是，银行信贷的放宽和分期付款购买限制的取消，这种人为措施，是不会使生产根本好转的。英国的“经济回顾”杂志承认：这两个措施，“对经济的影响本身就是临时性的。”“如果要使出售维持目前水平，消费者的债务总数必须继续增加。”但是在目前，消费者已经负债累累，这种虚假购买力的上升已经达到了饱和点。借贷债务压得人们喘不过气来。因此，再想扩大人民的债务，已经是很困难的了。今年1月，分期付款的赊购债务只增加一千九百万英镑，这表明消费支出已经缓慢下来。到今年2月，整个工业生产的指数，又比1月份下降了一点。这是零售贸易下降的结果。如果保守党政府不采取“新的措施”，消费支出势必继续下降。由此看来，人为的刺激只能使资本主义生产的发展越来越不平衡，而不能有助于生产的根本改善。
    “强盗式的”结余
    谈到英国政府的第二个“法螺”，更是见不得人的。大家都知道，英国对外有形贸易，每年都有赤字，而1958年竟然结余达一亿二千万英镑。这并不是大量增加出口的结果，相反地，英国去年的出口下降了3.5％。事实是，英国把危机的负担，转嫁到原料出产国的肩上。在去年一年内，英国由于资本主义世界原料价格下跌而发了横财。白皮书直率地承认：从外国进口的物价平均下降了8％，而从英国出口的物价只下降了1％。这样，英国平白地沾了7％的便宜。因此，英共“工人日报”把这种支付平衡的结余，称之为“强盗式的结余”。
    这种贸易结余，意味着对落后国家剥削的大大加强。大部分落后国家和英国的殖民地，都由于原料价格的下跌，遭到了重大的损失。这对于英国本身并不是绝对有利的。这些国家由于购买力的降低，不得不减少或限制进口；联邦国家以及英镑区的其他国家，为了弥补贸易上的赤字，大量从伦敦城提取它们的英镑存款（1958年即提取了八千二百万镑）。这就不能不反转来影响英国本身。英国要在今后再维持这么多的贸易结余，已经是非常困难的了。从去年第四季度起，英国对英镑区（特别是原料生产国家）的输出已大大下降。所以，在有形贸易方面，英国去年上半年的结余是一亿四千一百万镑，到下半年，就有二千万镑的赤字。
          储备外强中干
    支付平衡的结余，是使英国黄金和外汇储备增加的主要原因。到今年3月，英国的黄金、美元及其它外汇储存约合十一亿二千一百万英镑。单从这个数字看，似乎英国的储备确有了“好转”。但是，英国要想继续保持这种高度储备水平，是非常困难的。首先，它在苏伊士冒险时所借的“国际货币基金组织”的二亿镑，今年要进行第一次偿还，共七千一百万镑。其次，英国还必须以黄金来支付“国际货币基金组织”新的份额九千八百万镑。这样，总计是一亿六千九百万镑。再加上维持海外军事开支一年约需二亿一千六百万英镑以及需要偿付的其它债务，都要从这些储备中提取。与此同时，收支平衡结余今后不可能再有大的增加。因此，英国的储备不仅是不稳定的，而且有可能下降。
    新的“强心剂”
    当然，英国政府完全知道，它的经济情况并没有真正好转。正因为这样，它必须在放宽信贷和鼓励赊购等办法失灵之后，寻求新的“强心剂”，以“促进”生产。
    根据预算报告，英国政府将采取的新措施是：一、投资补贴：立即恢复资本消费方面的投资补贴。新工厂和新设备的投资补贴率为20％，工业建筑物建造的投资补贴率为10％。前者的首批补贴为10％，后者的首批补贴为5％。二、在下一财政年度内，削减所得税二亿二千九百万镑，削减购买税八千一百二十五万镑。
    十分明显，这个预算除了想诱惑一部分选民在下届大选中投保守党的票以外，主要是想通过免税来鼓励私人投资，扩大人民的消费支出，从而遏止工业生产下降的趋势。但是，即使资产阶级的报纸，也认为减三亿多英镑的税，起不了太大作用。“曼彻斯特卫报”就指出：“这些在税收方面的让步，不足以促使经济的重大发展。”
