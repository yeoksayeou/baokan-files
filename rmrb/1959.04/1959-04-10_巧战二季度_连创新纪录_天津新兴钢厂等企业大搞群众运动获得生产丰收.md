    Skillfully Fighting the Second Quarter, Continuously Breaking Records
    Tianjin New Steel Plant and Other Enterprises Launch Mass Movements and Achieve Production Success
    (Our report) The Tianjin New Steel Plant's employees have seen new records emerge one after another in the decisive second quarter. From March 28th to April 6th, the output of the three-ton converter shift has continuously set six new records. The new five-ton converter, on April 7th and 8th, reached furnace ages of fifty and forty-seven heats respectively, exceeding the daily production plan for high-quality welding rod steel by 17%.
    In the Red Flag Competition, the New Steel Plant greatly promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. Steelworkers and workers in the iron smelting, feeding, bricklaying, furnace repair, and casting sections worked together as one. On April 6th, the first shift of the new five-ton converter shortened the smelting time, and estimated that they could produce several more heats of steel. They asked the iron smelting workers for assistance. The iron smelting workers kept the molten iron fully prepared. With their strong cooperation, the first shift finally created a new record of seventeen heats per shift.
    (Our report) The No. 1 thirteen cubic meter blast furnace of the Baoding New Life Steel Plant had a great start to the second quarter, setting a new record of 20.749 tons of iron produced on April 4th, with a furnace utilization coefficient of 1.596. After setting a high production record of 18.854 tons of iron produced on March 29th, all employees of this furnace immediately put forward the bold slogan of "Catching up with Benxi, surpassing Pingshan, and striving to be the champion of the province," setting off a competition upsurge to create miracles and go to Beijing. In the competition, in order to achieve high production and high quality, break through the key to production, they firmly grasped the three major measures of strong wind and high temperature, material selection before the furnace, and careful processing of coarse grains, and adopted pre-furnace meetings to strengthen the analysis, research, and adjustment of furnace ore, ensuring the normal production of the blast furnace. Now all employees unanimously stated that while stabilizing high production, they will resolutely strive for a new record of 30 tons of iron produced per day.
    (Our Tianjin, April 9th dispatch) The Tianjin Steam Engine Factory fully mobilized its employees, carried out technical revolution on a large scale, and did everything possible to tap potential. Since April, it has comprehensively overfulfilled the production plan every day. As of the 8th, the output value has increased by more than double compared with the same period last month.
    This factory is a factory that undertakes the manufacture of coal washing and coking equipment reducers, belt conveyors, and drainage and irrigation equipment. When the April task was issued, the Party branch immediately convened a meeting to study it, further explained the task to the employees, and mobilized them to speak out and discuss, setting off a production upsurge centered on technical revolution.
    The employees were very enthusiastic and put forward fifteen major technical innovation proposals in just two days, and implemented them while proposing them. Yang Zeming, Ding Zhanju, and other employees of the milling and planing group in the second workshop reformed the tools, reducing the time required to process the plane of the coal washing equipment reducer housing from six hours to two hours. Old workers Han Yuliang and Liu Jieying led more than twenty apprentices to use the method of ants gnawing bones, increasing the efficiency of silicon steel gear rings from three and a half work shifts per gear to one work shift per gear.
    After the lathe workers improved their output, the foundry workers could not keep up, casting only five to six pieces a day, which could not meet the production needs of the lathe workers. At this time, the secretary of the factory Party branch went deep into the foundry workshop and personally mobilized the employees to find solutions. The employees put forward guarantees and formulated measures, adjusted the labor organization, and changed the operating method of modeling, which quickly improved the output and quality. Now, twelve castings can be cast every day, and the percentage of qualified products has increased from about 75% in the past to 100%.
    In this way, many problems were solved easily, and the production of the entire factory overfulfilled the production plan every day. (Attached picture)

### 巧战二季度　连创新纪录  天津新兴钢厂等企业大搞群众运动获得生产丰收

    巧战二季度　连创新纪录
    天津新兴钢厂等企业大搞群众运动获得生产丰收
    本报讯　天津新兴钢厂职工在决定性的第二季度里，新纪录层出不穷，从3月28日到4月6日，三吨转炉班产量已经连续创造六次新纪录；新五吨转炉在7日和8日两天，炉龄分别达到五十和四十七炉，超额17％完成了优质焊条钢的日产计划。
    新兴钢厂在红旗竞赛中，大大发扬了共产主义协作精神，炼钢工人和化铁、进料、打砖、修炉、浇铸工段的工人拧成一股绳。6日新五吨转炉甲班缩短了冶炼时间，估计还可以多出几炉钢，就向化铁炉工人求援，化铁炉工人把铁水始终准备得足足的，在他们的大力配合下，甲班终于创造了班产十七炉的新纪录。
    本报讯　保定新生钢铁厂一号十三立方公尺高炉，第二季度开门大吉，在4月4日创日产铁二十点七四九吨的新纪录，高炉利用系数达到了一点五九六。这个炉的全体职工在3月29日创日产铁十八点八五四吨的高产纪录以后，紧接着又提出了“赶本溪、超平山，力争全省当状元”的豪迈口号，掀起了创奇迹上北京的竞赛热潮。在竞赛中，为了实现高产优质，突破生产关键，紧紧地抓住了强风高温，炉前选料，粗粮细作三大措施，并且采取炉前会议，加强了对炉矿的分析研究和调整，保证了高炉正常生产。现在全体职工一致表示在稳定高产的同时，坚决争取日产铁三十吨的新纪录。
    本报天津9日电　天津市蒸汽机厂充分发动职工，大搞技术革命，千方百计挖掘潜力，4月份以来天天全面超额完成生产计划。截至8日，产值比上月同期增加了一倍多。
    这个工厂是承制洗煤炼焦设备减速机、皮带运输机及排灌设备的工厂。当4月份任务下达后，党支部立即召集会议进行研究，并将任务进一步向职工交了底，发动他们鸣放讨论，掀起了以技术革命为中心的生产高潮。
    职工们干劲很大，在短短的两天中就提出了十五项重大的技术革新建议，并且边提边实现。二车间铣刨组职工杨泽明、丁占举等改革了工具，使加工洗煤设备减速机外壳平面所需的时间由六小时压缩到两小时。老工人韩玉良、刘杰英带了二十多个徒工用蚂蚁啃骨头的办法，使矽钢牙轮由原来三个半工旋一个提高到一个工旋一个。
    车工提高了产量以后，铸工却赶不上来，一天只能铸五到六个，满足不了车工的生产需要。这时工厂党支部书记又深入到铸工车间，亲自发动职工想办法，职工们纷纷提保证订措施，调整了劳动组织，改变造型的操作方法，很快就提高了产量和质量。现在每天可以铸出十二个铸件，正品率由过去的75％左右提高到100％。
    这样，许多问题都迎刃而解，全厂的生产也就日日超额完成了生产计划。（附图片）
    沈阳矿山机器厂全体职工猛干巧干，提前四十三天完成了八十台洗煤机的任务。这是工人在起运板状给料机。
