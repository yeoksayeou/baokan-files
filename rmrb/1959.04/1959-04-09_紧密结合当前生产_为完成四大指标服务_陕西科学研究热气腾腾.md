Closely Integrate with Current Production to Serve the Completion of the Four Major Indicators
Shaanxi's Scientific Research is in Full Swing

(Our report) Xi'an - Shaanxi Province's scientific research work is closely integrated with current production, actively serving the completion of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and has already achieved significant results.

The Xi'an Metallurgical Industry Research Institute and the Oriental Machinery Factory cooperated to successfully test the use of raw dolomite as a lining for alkaline converters and alkaline iron smelting furnaces in one and a half months. According to preliminary estimates, if Shaanxi Province uses raw dolomite instead of calcined dolomite for furnace linings this year, it can save 800,000 to 1,000,000 yuan. Due to the lack of alkaline refractory materials such as magnesite in Shaanxi Province, steelmaking converters and iron smelting furnaces used acidic refractory materials as linings in the past, and the problem of desulfurization and dephosphorization could not be solved for a long time, which affected the quality of steel. For this reason, the relevant departments decided to switch to alkaline iron smelting furnaces and converters this year, using calcined dolomite instead of magnesite as the lining to ensure the production of good iron and good steel. However, a large amount of dolomite powder forms after calcination, and the recovery rate is only about 30%, which increases transportation volume and cost, and the output is very low, which is far from meeting production needs. Using raw dolomite as the lining for alkaline converters and magnesium smelting furnaces can solve the above problems.

While agricultural science research departments are conducting research closely around this year's grain and cotton production increase, they are also paying attention to laying the foundation for long-term agricultural construction. In order to better utilize and improve the soil and effectively increase the yield per unit area, the soil survey, identification, utilization, and planning work in Shaanxi Province has been fully launched. The soil survey of 2.95 million mu of land in Xingping and Chang'an counties, where work progressed earlier, has been completed. It is expected that the soil survey work in the province will be completed by the end of April. The Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other units have transferred more than 130 technical cadres and organized 22 working groups to conduct technical guidance for soil surveys in various counties (cities). Through soil surveys, communes have generally formulated soil distribution maps, soil erosion maps, soil grade maps, soil deep plowing maps, soil improvement zoning maps, and land rational utilization planning maps. Through these maps, it is possible to clearly understand the characteristics of each piece of land in the commune, the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium it contains, and the indicators suitable for deep plowing, which will play a great role in current deep plowing, fertilization, and crop distribution. Many communes, in conjunction with soil survey and identification work, have comprehensively arranged the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries of the entire commune, and planned residential areas, roads, and public cemeteries. This soil survey also provided valuable data and basis for future soil scientific research.

In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest and eliminate the most serious wheat stripe rust disease, agricultural science workers in Shaanxi Province have studied and mastered the occurrence and development law of stripe rust in the Guanzhong area, and combined with the production experience of the masses, they have found a set of methods to eliminate stripe rust, such as using soil burying leaf cutting and spraying ammonium sulfate. Relevant departments have formed a thousand-person technical corps and gone to various places to provide guidance. This set of methods has been promoted throughout the province and has basically controlled the development of stripe rust. In order to meet the requirements of this year's large-scale wheat bumper harvest and save labor, the Agricultural Machinery Research Institute has cooperated with farmer special researcher Liu Hengjie to improve the horse-drawn wheat harvester that was promoted last year, and is currently producing it in large quantities. The newly improved harvester can harvest in wheat fields with a yield of 600 to 800 jin per mu. The deep plowing plow and long-distance smoke sprayer researched by the institute have also been basically trial-produced. The Coal Industry Research Office is summarizing the experience of the masses and researching a set of methods to solve the problems of ventilation, lighting, transportation, and drainage in small coal kilns, and the experience of using indigenous methods to drill large wells.

Various scientific research institutions in Shaanxi Province pay special attention to combining with the masses to conduct research. Now, many professional research institutions transfer research topics that can be researched and tested at the grassroots level or by the masses to the people's communes or factories and mines, and cooperate with factories and mines and people's communes to conduct research, which not only improves work efficiency, but also enables research results to be promoted immediately. For example, the Irrigation Experiment Station jointly established by the Shaanxi Agricultural Science Branch and the Weihui Canal Administration, systematically transferred dozens of research topics to the ChunGuang and other people's communes in Xingping County, and cooperated with the masses to conduct research. All research projects can be completed within one or two years, which is equivalent to the workload of more than ten years by more than a dozen full-time researchers in the past. Moreover, the quality is improved compared with the separate research of professional researchers, and the research results can be promoted immediately.

Various scientific research units have transferred a large number of technical cadres to people's communes and factories and mines and other grassroots units. In conjunction with the current scientific research work, they have further summarized, improved, and promoted the rich production experience and advanced technologies related to steel, grain, cotton, coal, etc. created by the masses during the Great Leap Forward. In addition to transferring cadres to help the province with soil surveys and stripe rust control, the Agricultural Science Branch also transferred more than a dozen technical cadres to organize working groups to the ShuangWang Brigade of the Chengguan People's Commune in Weinan County to summarize the team's large-scale cotton and wheat production experience over the years. After the Weihui Canal Irrigation Experiment Station cooperated with the ChunGuang Commune last year to research an advanced irrigation method for underground irrigation (which has been promoted in the province's wheat satellite fields), it summarized last year's experience and further researched the relevant tools and technical issues of underground irrigation, so that this advanced experience can be applied in large-scale high-yield fields with different geographical conditions. Units such as the Industrial Machinery Research Institute have sent people to large factories or county and commune factories to investigate and study the design, manufacture, and use of indigenous machine tools, and plan to research and design a set of indigenous equipment suitable for county and commune industries from the systematic summary of mass experience.

    紧密结合当前生产　为完成四大指标服务
    陕西科学研究热气腾腾
    本报讯　陕西省科学研究工作紧密结合当前生产，积极为完成钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标服务，现已获得显著成绩。
    西安冶金工业研究所和东方机械厂合作，在一个半月时间内试验用生白云石作碱性转炉和碱性化铁炉炉衬成功。据初步估算，今年陕西如果全部用生白云石代替焙烧后的白云石作炉衬，可节约八十万至一百万元。陕西省由于缺乏镁砂等碱性耐火材料，过去炼钢转炉和化铁炉都是用酸性耐火材料作炉衬，脱硫脱磷问题长期不能解决，影响钢的质量。为此，有关部门决定今年全部改用碱性化铁炉和转炉，以焙烧后的白云石代替镁砂作炉衬，保证生产好铁好钢。但是白云石焙烧后大量粉化，回收率只有30％左右，因此增加了运输量和成本，产量很少，远不能满足生产需要，用生白云石作碱性转炉和化镁炉炉衬，就可解决上述问题。
    农业科学研究部门在与紧密围绕今年粮棉增产进行研究工作的同时，并注意为长远农业建设打下基础。为了更好的利用和改良土壤，有效地提高单位面积产量，陕西全省范围的土壤普查鉴定利用规划工作已经全面展开。工作进展比较早的兴平、长安两县的二百九十五万亩土地已经普查完毕，预计4月底全省土壤普查工作即可全部结束。中国农业科学院陕西分院等单位抽调一百三十多名技术干部，组织二十二个工作组，分别到各县（市）进行土壤普查的技术指导。通过土壤普查，各公社普遍制定了土壤分布图、土壤侵蚀图、土壤等级图、土壤深耕图、土壤改良区划图、土地合理利用规划图等。通过这些图纸，可以清楚地了解公社每一片土地的特性，含氮、磷、钾的数量及适合深耕的指标等，这对当前的深耕、施肥、确定作物分布等将起很大作用。很多公社结合土壤普查鉴定工作，对全社的农、林、牧、副、渔进行了全面安排，并对居民点、道路、公墓等进行规划。通过这次土壤普查还为今后开展土壤科学研究工作提供了宝贵的资料和依据。
    陕西省农业科学工作者们为确保小麦丰收，消灭危害小麦最严重的条锈病，研究掌握了条锈病在关中地区发生发展规律，并结合群众中的生产经验，找出了用埋土切叶法、喷射硫酸铵等消灭条锈病的一套办法。有关部门组成了千人技术兵团，分赴各地指导，这套办法已经在全省推广，并基本上控制了条锈病的发展。农业机械研究所为适应今年小麦大面积丰产的要求，节约劳动力，已经同农民特约研究员刘恒杰合作，将去年推广的马拉小麦收割机又作了改进，目前正在大量生产。新改进的这种收割机能在亩产六百斤至八百斤的麦田中进行收割。该所研究的深翻犁和远距离烟雾喷射器，也基本上试制成功。煤炭工业研究室正在总结群众经验，研究出一套解决小煤窑通风、照明、运输、排水等问题的办法和土法打大井的经验。
    陕西各个科学研究机构特别注意和群众结合进行研究。现在很多专业研究机构将基层研究单位或群众中能够研究试验的题目下放到人民公社或厂矿，同厂矿和人民公社合作进行研究，这样既提高了工作效率，研究成果也能立即推广。例如陕西农业科学分院与渭惠渠管理局合办的灌溉试验站、有计划地把几十个研究题目下放到兴平县春光等人民公社，与群众合作进行研究。一、二年内就可以将所有研究项目全部完成，相当于过去十余个专职研究人员十年至十五年的工作量。而且比专业研究员单独研究还提高了质量，研究成果可以马上推广。
    各科学研究单位抽调了大批技术干部到人民公社和厂矿等基层单位，结合目前的科学研究工作，把大跃进中群众创造的有关钢、粮、棉、煤等丰产经验和先进技术，进一步总结提高和推广，农业科学分院除抽调干部帮助全省搞土壤普查和条锈病外，还抽调了十多个技术干部组织工作组，到渭南县城关人民公社双王大队总结该队历年来棉花大面积丰产和小麦大面积丰产经验。渭惠渠灌溉试验站去年和春光公社合作研究出地下灌溉的先进灌溉办法（已在全省小麦卫星田中推广）后，又总结去年经验，进一步研究地下灌溉的有关工具和技术问题，以便使这个先进经验在不同地理条件的大面积丰产田中应用。工业机械研究所等单位已派人到大型工厂或县、社工厂调查研究土机床的设计、制造和使用情况，计划从系统的总结群众经验中研究设计出一套适合县、社工业用的土设备。
