Xinhua News Agency, April 29th (Reported by Indian News Service): Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in the Lok Sabha on the 27th regarding the situation in Tibet. The full text is as follows:

I have spoken in the Lok Sabha several times about the situation in Tibet. The last speech was delivered on April 3rd, at which time I informed the Lok Sabha that the Dalai Lama, along with a large entourage, had entered the territory of the Indian Federation. I would like to provide the latest information on this matter and report to the Lok Sabha on the new facts we have in our possession.

A few days ago, the Dalai Lama and his party arrived in Mussoorie, where the government made arrangements for their residence. Since then, I had the opportunity to visit Mussoorie and have a long conversation with the Dalai Lama.

In recent days, we have received reports that a considerable number, several thousand Tibetans, have recently crossed the border into the Kameng region of the Northeast Frontier Agency, and in addition, about several hundred people have entered the territory of Bhutan. They have requested asylum, and we have agreed. Those among them who carried weapons have been disarmed. We do not yet know their exact number. Temporary arrangements are being made in a camp to settle them until they can be dispersed according to their wishes, while considering the needs under the circumstances. We cannot leave these refugees helpless. In addition to involving humanitarian considerations, there are also issues of law and order to consider. We thank the Assam government for its assistance and cooperation in this matter.

As for the Dalai Lama and his entourage, we cannot but take full measures, both for security reasons and to protect them from the harassment of large numbers of Indian and foreign journalists. These journalists, eager to obtain first-hand information about this world event, are likely to trouble the Dalai Lama and his entourage and almost overwhelm them. We are eager to provide protection to the Dalai Lama and his entourage, and at the same time we agree to allow these journalists appropriate opportunities to see him. I have received nearly seventy-five applications from news agencies and newspapers issued from Tezpur, requesting me to grant them this opportunity. Therefore, a senior official from the Ministry of External Affairs was sent to Tezpur in advance to deal with the press representatives and photographers gathered in this small town in Assam. The official made the necessary administrative arrangements to satisfy the journalists' desire to meet and photograph the Dalai Lama as much as possible. Shortly after entering India, the Dalai Lama expressed his wish to issue a statement. We were later notified that the statement would be issued in Tezpur. Our officials made arrangements to distribute translations of the statement to newspaper reporters.

In view of certain irresponsible accusations that have been made, I would like to make it clear that the Dalai Lama is entirely responsible for this statement and the shorter statement he subsequently issued in Mussoorie. Our officials had nothing to do with the drafting or preparation of either statement.

I need not tell the Lok Sabha that the Dalai Lama entered India entirely of his own free will. We never suggested that he come to India at any time. We naturally considered the possibility that he might seek asylum in India, and when such a request was made, we granted it without hesitation. His entry into a remote corner of our country with a large number of people has created special problems in terms of transportation, organization, and security. We sent an official to Bomdila to meet the Dalai Lama and his entourage and escort them to Mussoorie. The reason for choosing this official was that he had served as Consul-General in Lhasa and was therefore to some extent familiar to the Dalai Lama and his officials. The choice of Mussoorie as the Dalai Lama's place of residence was finalized after understanding his own wishes on this matter and with his agreement. We did not want to impose any inappropriate restrictions on him, but in special circumstances, some arrangements had to be made to prevent any misfortune. It should be remembered that the final developments in Tibet leading to the Dalai Lama's departure from Lhasa to India caused great concern among the Indian people and the world press. After his arrival in Mussoorie, measures were taken to prevent the Dalai Lama from being troubled by crowds and journalists who wanted to see him. Apart from this, there were no restrictions on his movements. He was told that he and his entourage were free to move around Mussoorie. It should be remembered that the Dalai Lama has not only recently undergone a long and arduous journey, but has also encountered a sad experience that even the most hard-hearted person cannot but be shaken by. And he is only twenty-four years old.

These are some very obvious facts, but behind these facts lie serious developments that may have far-reaching consequences. A tragedy has occurred and is occurring in Tibet, and people have become impulsive, making various accusations and using language that will only make the situation worse and damage our relations with our northern neighbor. I am sure the Lok Sabha will agree with me that when considering such an important issue, we should be restrained and use wisdom, using mild and precise language. In the current Cold War era, there is a tendency to use unrestrained language and often make unreasonable and violent accusations. Fortunately, we have always stayed out of the Cold War, and I hope that this time, as on any other occasion, we will not use the language of the Cold War. The problem is too serious to be dealt with in a casual or excited manner. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the press and the public to speak with restraint. I regret that we on this side occasionally lose restraint. I particularly regret that a few days ago, someone showed serious disrespect to the portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, the head of state of China. This was done in Mumbai by a few irresponsible people. We must not allow ourselves to be pushed down the wrong path in a moment of excitement.

I cannot be the one to issue any similar appeals to the leaders, newspapers, and people of China. All I can say is that I am very saddened by the tone of the comments and accusations made by the responsible people in China about India. They have used the language of the Cold War, regardless of the facts and etiquette. This is especially sad when it happens in a great country with a cultural tradition of thousands of years, known for its measured behavior and courtesy. The accusations made against India are so absurd that I find it difficult to address them. One accusation is that we abducted the Dalai Lama. The Chinese authorities should certainly know how we operate in this country, what our laws and constitution are like. Even if we had such an intention, we would not be able to impose some kind of detention on the Dalai Lama against his will. And there is simply no question of us wanting to do so. We would gain nothing by doing so, but only bear the burden of difficult problems. In any case, this issue can be easily clarified. The Dalai Lama can return to Tibet or go to any place he wishes at any time. Because the Panchen Lama has made some particularly strange remarks, I have stated that we welcome him to India to meet the Dalai Lama in person. If he is willing to do so, he will be treated with all due courtesy. I have also said that the Chinese Ambassador or any other envoy of the Chinese government can come to India for this purpose to meet the Dalai Lama. Anyone who wants to come to India peacefully will not encounter any obstacles. Whether we agree with his views or not, we will treat him with the courtesy due to a guest.

Another, even stranger, claim has been made about "Indian expansionists," who are said to be the inheritors of the British imperialist and expansionist traditions. It is perfectly true that British policy was to pursue a policy of expansion in Tibet, and that they used force to implement this policy earlier this century. In our view, this was a senseless and brutal adventure, which caused great harm to the Tibetan people. As a result of this venture, the British government in India at that time established certain extraterritorial rights in Tibet. When India became independent, we inherited some of these rights. Since we are completely opposed to having any of these extraterritorial rights in another country, we did not want to maintain them. But the Lok Sabha knows very well that in the early days after independence and partition, we were very busy and had to deal with very difficult situations in our own country. We did not pay attention to Tibet, if I may say so. As we were unable to find suitable personnel to serve as our representative in Lhasa, for a period of time we allowed the original British representative to continue to serve in Lhasa. Later, an Indian replaced him. Shortly after the Chinese army entered Tibet, the issue of these extraterritorial rights was raised, and we agreed without hesitation to abandon these rights. No matter what developments might occur in Tibet, we would always have relinquished these rights. We withdrew our troops from certain parts of Tibet and handed over Indian postal and telecommunications facilities and rest houses. We stipulated the Five Principles of Panchsheel, placing our relations with the Tibetan region on a new basis. We were very concerned to maintain the traditional links between India and Tibet in terms of pilgrimage and trade. The actions we took on this matter and what we did later concerning Tibet are sufficient to prove our policy, sufficient to prove that India has no political or ulterior motives in Tibet. Indeed, even from the narrowest practical point of view, any other policy would be wrong and useless. Since then, we have not only striven to abide by the agreements we have concluded, but also to seek the friendship of China and the Chinese people.

Therefore, it is something that makes us feel deeply regretful and surprised that these accusations, which are both inappropriate and completely unfounded, have been made. We have expressed this deep regret to the Chinese government, especially at the speeches made at the recent session of the National People's Congress in Beijing.

I said earlier that our broad policy is governed by three factors: firstly, maintaining India's security and integrity; secondly, our desire to maintain friendly relations with China; and thirdly, our deep sympathy for the Tibetan people. We will continue to pursue this policy, because we believe that it is not only the right policy at present, but even more so in the future. It would be a tragedy if India and China, the two great countries of Asia, two countries that have been harmonious neighbors for generations, were to develop hostile feelings towards each other. We for our part will pursue this policy, but we hope that China will do the same, we hope that nothing will be said or done that would endanger the friendly relations between the two countries, which are so important from the point of view of broader Asian and world peace. One of the Five Principles stipulates mutual respect. If unfounded accusations are made and the language of the Cold War is used, this mutual respect will be seriously undermined.

I have made it clear before that the accusation that Kalimpong is a center of Tibetan rebellion is completely unfounded. A large number of people of Tibetan descent reside in our India as Indian citizens. We also have some Tibetan immigrants in India. All these people greatly respect the Dalai Lama. Among them, some are extremely unhappy about the developments in Tibet; some undoubtedly have anti-Chinese sentiments. We have made it clear to them that they are not allowed to carry out any subversive activities from India, and I must say that, in general, their actions have followed the instructions of the Indian government. Obviously, I cannot say that someone has not secretly done something, but it seems to me that it takes a great deal of imagination, and ignores obvious facts, to imagine or say that a small group of people living in Kalimpong organized a large-scale disturbance in Tibet.

The Khampa rebellion occurred more than three years ago in areas of mainland China close to Tibet. Is Kalimpong to be held responsible for this? This rebellion gradually expanded, and undoubtedly made a strong impression on the minds of many Tibetans who did not participate in the rebellion. Fear and anxiety for their future controlled their minds, and ardent nationalist sentiments dominated their emotions. Their fears may be unfounded, but there is no denying that such fears exist. To properly deal with such emotions, only gentler means than war can be adopted.

When Premier Zhou Enlai was here two or three years ago, he was kind enough to discuss the issue of Tibet with me in considerable detail. We had a frank and full discussion. He told me that although Tibet has been a part of China for a long time, they do not regard Tibet as a province of China. The people there are different from the people of mainland China, just as the people of other autonomous regions of China are different from the people of mainland China, even though they constitute a part of the country. Therefore, they consider Tibet to be an autonomous region that will enjoy autonomy. He also told me that it would be absurd for anyone to think that China would impose communism on Tibet. Communism cannot be imposed on a very backward country in this way, and they do not want to do so, although they hope to gradually implement reforms. They intend to postpone even these reforms for quite some time.

Around that time, the Dalai Lama was also here, and I had a long conversation with him at the time. I told him about Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly attitude and his assurances about respecting Tibet's autonomy. I suggested that he sincerely accept these assurances, cooperate to maintain this autonomy, and implement certain reforms in Tibet. The Dalai Lama agreed at the time that his country, although he said it was advanced in spiritual terms, was very backward in social and economic terms and therefore needed reform.

To what extent these friendly intentions and attitudes have been realized is not for us to say. The situation is undoubtedly difficult. On the one hand, there is a vibrant, rapidly advancing society; and on the other hand, there is a static, unchanging society that is worried about what might be done to it in the name of reform. The distance between the two is great, and it seems difficult to find any meeting point. At the same time, some form of change inevitably came to Tibet. Transportation has developed rapidly, and Tibet's long-standing isolation has been partially broken. Although material obstacles have gradually been removed, psychological and emotional obstacles have increased. Obviously, attempts to break down these psychological and emotional barriers either have not been made, or have not been made successfully.

To say that this is entirely the responsibility of certain "upper-class reactionaries" in Tibet seems to be an extraordinarily simplistic way of explaining a complex situation. Even according to information obtained from the Chinese side, the scale of the Tibetan riots was quite large, and the basis of this riot must be a strong nationalist sentiment, which affects not only the upper classes, but also others. There is no doubt that vested interest groups participated in the riots and tried to benefit from them. Trying to explain the situation with rather outdated words, phrases and slogans is of little help.

When news of these unpleasant developments reached India, it immediately aroused a strong and widespread reaction. This reaction was not caused by the government. Nor was this reaction essentially political. This reaction was mainly one of sympathy based on emotional and humanitarian reasons. It was also based on the close feelings caused by the long-standing religious and cultural ties with the Tibetan people. This was an instinctive reaction. It is true that some people in India did try to steer this reaction in inappropriate directions and benefit from it. However, the reaction of the Indian people is an obvious fact. If the reaction here is already like this, then it is not difficult to imagine what the reaction of the Tibetans themselves is like. Perhaps other Buddhist countries in Asia also have this reaction. When such a strong sentiment, which is essentially non-political, exists, it cannot be handled merely with political methods, let alone with military methods. We do not want to interfere in Tibet at all; we very much hope to maintain the friendship between India and China; but at the same time, we are very sympathetic to the Tibetan people, and we feel very sorry for their difficult situation. We still hope that the Chinese authorities will adopt a wise attitude, not use their great power to deal with the Tibetans, but win them over through friendly cooperation based on their own guarantees of autonomy for the Tibetan region. First of all, we hope that the current fighting and killing will stop.

I said above that I had a long conversation with the Dalai Lama in Mussoorie three days ago. He talked to me about the various difficulties he had to deal with, the growing resentment of his people towards the situation there, how he tried to restrain them, and the idea that Buddhism, which he considered more important than life, was under threat. He said that he did not want to leave Lhasa until the last moment arrived. It was only on the afternoon of March 17, when, according to him, a few shells hit his palace, landing in the nearby pond, that he suddenly decided to leave Lhasa. Within a few hours of that day, he and his entourage left Lhasa and began the dangerous journey to the Indian border. The departure was so hasty that it was not even possible to bring enough clothes and other supplies. When I met with the Dalai Lama, none of his entourage was present. Even the interpreter was our own. The Dalai Lama told me that the two statements previously issued were entirely his own. There was no question of anyone forcing him to issue them. Although he is very young, I find it hard to imagine that he would be forced to do something he does not want to do. I fully sympathize with this young man. He has had to shoulder heavy burdens and assume great responsibilities at a young age. He has been very tired both physically and mentally in the past few weeks. I advised him to rest for a period of time and not to make any hasty decisions. He felt very unhappy about the situation in Tibet, and he was particularly eager for the fighting to stop.

### 尼赫鲁在印度人民院就西藏局势发表的讲话

    尼赫鲁在印度人民院就西藏局势发表的讲话
    新华社29日讯　据印度新闻处报道：印度总理尼赫鲁27日在人民院就西藏局势发表了讲话。全文如下：
    我曾在人民院就西藏局势讲过几次话。上一次讲话是在4月3日发表的，那时我通知人民院说，达赖喇嘛带着一大批随从，已经进入印度联邦的领土。我愿提供关于这方面的最新的情况，并且向人民院报告一下我们所掌握的这些新事实。
    几天以前，达赖喇嘛和他的一行人到达穆索里，在那里，政府为他们的居留作了安排。那以后，我曾有机会访问穆索里，并且同达赖喇嘛作了一次长谈。
    最近几天，我们接到的报告说，有相当多的、为数几千名西藏人最近越界进入东北边境特区的卡门地区，此外约有几百人进入了不丹领土。他们要求避难，我们同意了。他们当中带武器的人被解除了武装。我们还不知道他们的确切人数。在能够按照他们的愿望、同时考虑这种情况下的需要，使他们散去以前，现在正在一个营地作出暂时安排来安顿他们。我们不能让这些难民无依无靠。除了牵涉到人道考虑之外，也还有法律秩序问题需要考虑。我们感谢阿萨姆政府在这件事情上给予的协助和合作。
    就达赖喇嘛和他的一行人来说，我们不能不采取充分的措施，这是为了安全着想，也是为了使得他们免于受到大批印度和外国记者的骚扰。这些记者们由于渴望取得关于这件世界大事的第一手材料，很可能会使达赖喇嘛和他的一行人麻烦，并且几乎会使他们应接不暇。我们急切希望给予达赖喇嘛和他的一行人保护，同时我们也同意让这些新闻记者有适当的机会见到他。我接到了通讯社和报纸的将近七十五个代表从提斯浦尔发出的申请，要求我给他们这种机会。因此事先派了一名外交部的高级官员到提斯浦尔去，去应付聚集在这个阿萨姆邦小城的报界代表和摄影记者们。这位官员作了必要的行政上的安排，来尽可能地满足新闻记者们要会见达赖喇嘛和替他摄影的愿望。达赖喇嘛在进入印度之后不久，就表示希望发表声明。我们后来得到通知，这个声明将在提斯浦尔发表。我们的官员为向报纸记者们分发声明译文作了安排。
    鉴于所提出的某些不负责任的指责，我愿意说清楚，达赖喇嘛对于这项声明以及其后他在穆索里发表的较简短的声明完全负责。我们的官员同这两个声明的草拟或者准备没有关系。
    我无需对人民院说，达赖喇嘛完全是出于他自己的意愿进入印度的。我们在任何时候都从未建议他来印度。我们自然曾考虑到他谋求在印度避难的可能性，当这样的请求提出时，我们就毫不犹豫地答应了。他带着大批人进入我国偏僻的一隅，这在运输、组织和安全方面造成了特别的问题。我们派了一名官员在邦迪拉迎接达赖喇嘛和他的一行人，并且护送他们到穆索里。其所以选择这位官员，是因为他曾任驻拉萨总领事，因此在某种程度上是为达赖喇嘛和他的官员所熟悉的。选择穆索里作为达赖喇嘛的居留地是在了解了他本人在这个问题上的愿望和在他同意之后才最后确定的。我们方面并不想对他施加任何不恰当的限制，但是在特殊情况下，不能不作某种安排来防止任何不幸。应该记住，在西藏发生的最后发展到达赖喇嘛离开拉萨进入印度的那种种事件，在印度人民中间和世界报界中引起了极大的关切。在他到达穆索里以后，就采取了措施来防止达赖喇嘛受到要想见他的群众和新闻记者的麻烦。除此之外，对他的行动没有任何限制。曾经告诉他，他和他的随行人员可以在穆索里随意走动。应当记住，达赖喇嘛最近不仅经过了一次艰苦危险的长途跋涉，而且遭遇了一场令人哀伤的经历，甚至硬心肠的人也不能不感到震动的。而他不过刚刚二十四岁。
    这就是某些十分明显的事实，但是在这些事实背后隐藏着可能有深远后果的严重发展。西藏发生了而且正在发生着悲剧，人们冲动了起来，发出了种种指责，并且使用了只会使局势更糟、使我们同我们北方邻国的关系恶化的语言。我确信，人民院会同意我的看法：在考虑这样重要的问题的时候，我们应当有节制和运用智慧，使用温和确切的语言。在现在的冷战时代中，有一种使用放纵的语言和常常提出毫无道理的、狂暴的指责的倾向。我们幸而一直置身于冷战之外，我希望在这一次，就像在任何其他时候一样，我们将不使用冷战的语言。问题太严重了，不能以随便的或者激动的态度来处理。因此，我愿呼吁报刊和公众说话时要有节制。我感到很遗憾，我们这方面偶尔也有失去节制的时候。我特别感到遗憾的是，几天以前，有人对中国国家元首毛泽东主席的画像表现了严重的不礼貌。这是少数不负责任的人在孟买干的事。我们不能让自己在一时激动的情况之下被推上错误的道路。
    向中国的领袖、报纸和人民发出任何类似的呼吁的事，不能由我来做。我所能说的只是，对于中国的负责人士对印度所作的评论和指责的语调，我感到非常难过。他们不顾事实真相和礼节，使用了冷战的语言。这种情况发生在一个有着数千年文化传统、以行为有度和彬彬有礼著称的伟大国家，就尤其令人难过。对印度所作的指责如此荒诞，我觉得很难对待这些指责。有一种指责说我们劫持达赖喇嘛。中国当局肯定应当知道我们在这个国家中是如何行事的，我们的法律和宪法是什么样的。即令我们有这样的意向，我们也无法违背达赖喇嘛的意志而对他实行某种拘留。而且根本不存在我们想这样做的问题。我们这样做，不能得到什么，而只会得到困难问题的负担。不管怎样，这个问题是能够容易地澄清的。达赖喇嘛任何时候都可以回到西藏或者到他愿意去的任何地方去。由于班禅喇嘛特别发表了某些奇怪的言论，我已经声明，我们欢迎他到印度来亲自会见达赖喇嘛。如果他愿意这样做，他将受到一切礼遇。我还说过，中国大使或中国政府的任何其他使者可以为此目的前来印度会见达赖喇嘛。任何人要和平地到印度来都不会遇到障碍。不管我们是否同意他的看法，我们将给予他一位客人应受的礼遇。
    还提出了另一个甚至更奇怪的关于“印度扩张主义分子”的说法，据说，“印度扩张主义分子”是英国的帝国主义和扩张的传统的继承者。英国的政策是对西藏实行扩张的政策，而且他们在本世纪早期曾以武力来执行这种政策，这是完全正确的。在我们看来，这是毫无道理的、残酷的冒险，它给西藏人带来了很大的损害。由于这种冒险的结果，当时印度的英国政府在西藏建立了某些治外法权。当印度独立时，我们继承了这些权利中的一些。由于我们是完全反对在另一个国家拥有任何这些治外法权的，我们不想保持这些权利。但是人民院知道得很清楚，在独立和分治后的早期，我们非常忙，而且我们必须应付我们自己国内的非常困难的局面。我们没有去注意西藏，如果我可以这样说的话。由于不能够找出适当的人员来担任我们驻拉萨的代表，有一段时期我们让原有的英国代表继续在拉萨留任。后来印度人代替了他的位置。在中国军队进入西藏以后不久，这些治外法权的问题就提出了，我们毫不犹豫地同意放弃这些权利。不管西藏可能出现什么事态发展，我们本来总是要放弃这些权利的。我们从西藏的某些地方撤出了我们的部队，移交了印度的邮电设施和休息所。我们规定了潘查希拉五项原则，把我们同西藏地区的关系放在新的基础之上。我们非常关切的是维护印度和西藏之间在香客往来和贸易方面的传统联系。我们在这个问题上采取的行动以及我们后来有关西藏的所作所为足以证明我们的政策，足以证明印度在西藏没有政治的或者不可告人的野心。的确，甚至从最狭窄的实际观点来看，任何其他的政策都会是错误的和无用的。自从那时以来，我们一直不仅竭力遵守我们缔结的协议，而且竭力谋求中国和中国人民的友谊。
    因此，竟然提出这些既不适当又完全没有根据的指责，这是使我们感到深为遗憾和惊讶的事。我们已经向中国政府表达了这种深刻的遗憾情绪，特别是对最近在北京的全国人民代表大会本届会议上的发言的深刻遗憾情绪。
    我前些时候说过，我们的广泛政策是受三个因素支配的：第一，维护印度的安全和完整；第二，我们跟中国保持友好关系的愿望；第三，我们对西藏人民的深切同情。我们将继续奉行这种政策，因为我们认为，这不仅在目前是正确的政策，在将来更其是正确的政策。如果印度和中国这两个亚洲的伟大国家，这两个过去世世代代一直是和睦的邻邦的国家竟然彼此产生了敌对情绪，这将是一个悲剧。我们这方面将奉行这个政策，但是我们希望中国也会这样做，我们希望不要说出什么话或者做出什么事来危及从更广泛的亚洲和世界和平的观点来看是如此重要的两国之间的友好关系。五项原则之中就有一项规定互相尊重。如果提出毫无根据的指责、使用冷战的语言，这种互相尊重就要受到严重的损害。
    我以前已经说清楚，关于噶伦堡是西藏叛乱中心的指责是完全没有根据的。有众多的西藏血统的人作为印度国民居住在我们印度。我们印度还有一些西藏移民。所有这些人都非常尊敬达赖喇嘛。在他们中，有些人对于西藏的事态发展感到极不愉快；有些人无疑是有反中国情绪的。我们已经向他们表明，不允许他们从印度进行任何颠覆性活动，我要说，一般说来，他们的行动是遵照了印度政府的指示的。显然我不能够说某人没有秘密地干某件事情，但是在我看来，如果想像或者说住在噶伦堡的一小批人组织了西藏的一次大规模骚乱，这似乎要拿出很大的想像力，并且不顾明显的事实。
    康巴暴乱是三年多以前在中国本部靠近西藏的地区发生的。难道要噶伦堡对此负责吗？这次暴乱逐渐扩大，而且无疑在没有参加这次暴乱的众多的西藏人思想上造成了强烈的印象。对他们的前途的恐惧和忧虑控制着他们的心灵，激昂的民族主义感情支配着他们的情绪。他们的恐惧也许是没有根据的，但是这种恐惧无疑是不能否认的。要适当地对待这种情绪，只能采取比战争温和的办法。
    当周恩来总理两三年前到这里来的时候，承蒙他同我相当详细地讨论了西藏问题。我们进行了一次坦率和充分的会谈。他对我说，虽然西藏长时期以来一直是中国的一部分，但是他们不认为西藏是中国的一个省。那里的人民不同于中国本部的人民，正如中国的其他自治地区的人民不同于中国本部的人民一样，尽管他们构成这个国家的一部分。因此，他们认为西藏是一个将享有自治权的自治地区。他还对我说，谁要是以为中国将把共产主义强加于西藏，那是荒谬的。共产主义是不能以这种方式强加在一个非常落后的国家的，他们不想这样做，尽管他们希望逐步地实行改革。他们打算甚至把这种改革也推迟相当的时候。
    大约在那个时候，达赖喇嘛也在这里，我当时同他作了长谈。我告诉他周恩来总理的友好的态度和他关于尊重西藏自治的保证。我当时建议他真心诚意地接受这些保证，进行合作来保持这种自治，并在西藏实现某些改革。达赖喇嘛当时同意，他的国家虽然据他说在精神方面是先进的，但是在社会和经济方面是非常落后的，因而需要改革。
    这些友好的意图和态度究竟实现到了什么程度，这不是由我们来说的事。情况无疑是困难的。一方面，是一个活跃的、迅速前进的社会；而另一方面，是一个静止的、没有改变的、担心可能会在改革的名义下对自己采取什么行动的社会。两者之间的距离很大，看来很难有任何会合点。与此同时，某种形式的改变不可避免地来到了西藏。交通迅速地发展了，西藏长期的与世隔绝的状态部分地被冲破了。虽然，物质上的障碍逐步消除了，可是心理上和感情上的障碍却增加了。显然，冲破这些心理上和感情上的障碍的尝试或者没有作，或者作了没有成功。
    如果说这完全要由西藏若干“上层反动分子”负责，看来这种说法是把一种复杂的情况异乎寻常地简单化了。甚至根据得自中国方面的消息，西藏暴乱的规模也是相当大的，这个暴乱的基础一定是强烈的民族主义情绪，这种情绪不仅影响着上层阶级的人，而且影响着其他人。毫无疑问，既得利益集团参加了暴乱，并且企图从中得利。试图用颇为陈旧的字眼、措辞和口号来解释情况，是很少有甚么帮助的。
    当这些不愉快的事态发展的消息传到印度来的时候，立即引起了强烈的普遍的反应。这种反应并不是政府引起的。这种反应实质上也不是政治性的。这种反应主要是一种基于情感和人道原因的同情。也还基于同西藏人民久远的宗教和文化联系所造成的亲密感情。这是本能的反应。不错，印度有些人的确企图把这种反应引导到不适当的方向而从中得利。但是，印度人民的反应却是明摆着的事实。如果这里的反应尚且如此，那么人们就不难设想西藏人自己的反应怎样了。也许亚洲的其他佛教国家也有这种反应。当这种实质上不是政治性的强烈情绪存在的时候，那是不能仅仅用政治方法来处理的，更不能用军事方法来处理了。我们一点也不想干涉西藏；我们非常希望保持印度和中国之间的友谊；但是同时，我们非常同情西藏人民，我们对于他们的困难处境感到非常难过。我们仍然希望，中国当局会采取明智的态度，不使用他们巨大的力量来对付西藏人，而根据他们自己就西藏地区的自治作出的保证通过友好合作来争取他们。首先，我们希望，目前的战斗和杀戮将会终止。
    我在上面已经说过，三天前我在穆索里同达赖喇嘛进行了一次长谈。他向我谈到了他不得不应付的各种困难，他的人民对于那里的情况的日益增长的愤懑，谈到他如何设法约束他们，谈到他认为对他来说比生命还重要的佛教正在受到威胁的想法。他说，在最后时刻来到以前，他还不想离开拉萨。只是在3月17日下午，据他说几发炮弹向他的宫殿打过来时，落在附近的池塘中时，他才突然决定离开拉萨。在当天的几个小时内，他和他的随行人员离开了拉萨，开始了前往印度边境的危险的旅程。离开是这么匆忙，甚至不可能携带足够的衣服等杂物。当我和达赖喇嘛会谈时，他的随行人员一个也没有在场。连译员也是我们自己的。达赖喇嘛告诉我，先前发表的两个声明完全是他自己的。不存在任何人强迫他发表的问题。尽管他很年青，可是我很难想像他会被迫做他所不希望做的事情。我完全同情这个青年人。他在年轻的时候就不得不担起重担和承担巨大的责任。在过去几个星期，他身心十分劳累。我劝他休息一个时期而不要作出任何仓卒的决定。他对于西藏的情况感到很不愉快，他特别切望战斗停止。
