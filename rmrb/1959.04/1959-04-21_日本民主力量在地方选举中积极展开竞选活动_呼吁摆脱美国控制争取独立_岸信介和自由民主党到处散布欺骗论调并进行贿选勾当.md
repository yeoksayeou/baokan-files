Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The local election campaign struggle between Japanese democratic forces and reactionary forces, centering on the issues of peace and independence, has entered a tense stage.

Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo, Japanese Communist Party Chairman Nosaka Sanzo, as well as Japanese Prime Minister and Liberal Democratic Party President Kishi Nobusuke, and leaders of various parties have been traveling by plane or train to major cities and regions such as Osaka, Hokkaido, Kyoto, and Fukuoka in the past two days to deliver campaign speeches.

Nosaka Sanzo, in a speech in Osaka yesterday, condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for adhering to a policy of hostility towards China and exposed the conspiracy of the US-Japan revision of the "Security Treaty" to establish a US-Japan military alliance. Nosaka said that the Japanese Communist Party has nominated 767 candidates in this local election. He also expressed confidence that the number of Communist Party members in local councils will greatly increase.

Suzuki Mosaburo said in a speech in Hokkaido yesterday that the Socialist Party must put in more effort in the Hokkaido gubernatorial election in particular. He also stated that the Socialist Party would pursue Kishi Nobusuke's responsibility on issues such as Japan-China relations and the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

Kishi Nobusuke flew to Hokkaido today, planning to conduct two days of deceptive propaganda.

The Tokyo gubernatorial and assembly elections are the most intense battlegrounds between democratic forces and conservative forces in this local election. In the gubernatorial election, the candidate nominated by the "Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for Peace and Democracy," jointly formed by the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and mass organizations, is Arida Hachiro; the candidate nominated by the Liberal Democratic Party is Azuma Ryotaro. In the assembly election, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party have nominated 63 and 21 candidates respectively.

Kasuga Shoichi, chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, has recently delivered many campaign speeches in various locations. In each speech, Kasuga emphasized that abolishing the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and withdrawing US military bases from Japan are prerequisites for achieving Japanese independence and also for the prosperity of Tokyo. Kasuga also pointed out that the Tokyo District Court's ruling on the Sunagawa Incident, declaring the US-Japan "Security Treaty" unconstitutional, is of great significance. He said that we must urge the US military to withdraw all military bases established within Tokyo and recover the Ogasawara Islands, which were originally under Tokyo's jurisdiction.

Kasuga emphasized that Japan's security can only be maintained through neutralization and the guarantee of Japan's neutrality by the Soviet Union, China, and the United States.

The Japanese Communist Party's assembly candidates also emphasized the importance of abolishing the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and withdrawing US military bases in their campaign speeches.

The Socialist Party, led by Secretary-General Asanuma Inejiro as the head of the election countermeasures headquarters, is conducting a campaign. Asanuma and Socialist Party's Tokyo gubernatorial candidate Arida Hachiro emphasized in their speeches exposing the corruption of the Liberal Democratic Party government and stated that the Socialist Party will strive to achieve "clean politics." They also stated that they must strive to declare Tokyo a city of peace.

Asanuma and Arida jointly called on citizens to be vigilant against the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to turn Tachikawa and Niijima bases into missile bases, and pointed out that the root of this danger lies in the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

On the other hand, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is trying its best to falsely use the good names of "peace" and "independence," spreading deceptive fallacies, and carrying out extensive vote-buying and other bribery activities. As a result, violations of election laws have occurred on a large scale in Japan. As of the 16th, 129 people had been arrested for violating election laws, and the police authorities had issued 10,505 warnings.

    呼吁摆脱美国控制争取独立
    岸信介和自由民主党到处散布欺骗论调并进行贿选勾当
    新华社讯　东京消息：日本民主力量同反动势力围绕和平和独立问题在各地展开的地方选举竞选斗争，已进入紧张阶段。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎、日本共产党主席野坂参三以及日本首相、自由民主党总裁岸信介和各政党的领导人这两天都分别乘飞机或火车到大阪、北海道、京都、福冈等重要城市和地区，发表竞选演说。
    野坂参三昨天在大阪发表谈话，谴责岸信介政府坚持敌视中国的政策，并且揭露美日修改“安全条约”的阴谋是建立日美军事同盟。野坂说，日本共产党在这次地方选举中共推荐了七百六十七名候选人。他并且表示相信，共产党在地方议会中的议员将大大增加。
    铃木茂三郎昨天在北海道发表谈话说，社会党特别要在北海道的知事选举中多付出力量。他并且表示社会党要在日中关系、修改日美“安全条约”等问题上追究岸信介的责任。
    岸信介今天乘飞机到北海道，计划进行两天的欺骗宣传。
    东京的知事选举和议员选举是民主力量同保守势力在这次地方选举中竞争最剧烈的地方。在知事选举方面，社会党、共产党和群众团体联合组成的“东京都维护和平和民主共同斗争会议”提出的候选人是有田八郎；自由民主党提出的候选人是东龙太郎。在议员选举中社会党和共产党分别提出了六十三名和二十一名候选人参加竞选。
    日本共产党东京都委员会委员长春日正一最近在各处发表了许多次竞选演讲。春日在每次演讲中都着重指出，废除日美“安全条约”和撤销日本境内的美军基地是争取日本独立的前提条件，也是使东京繁荣的前提条件。春日并且指出，东京地方裁判所在对砂川事件的判决中宣布日美“安全条约”违反日本宪法是有重要意义的。他说，我们必须促使美军撤销设立在东京境内的一切军事基地，并且收回原来归东京管辖的小笠原群岛。
    春日强调指出，只有中立化和由苏联、中国、美国保障日本的中立，日本的安全才能保持。
    日本共产党的议员候选人们也都在他们的竞选演讲中强调废除日美“安全条约”和撤销美军基地的重要性。
    社会党由书记长浅沼稻次郎担任选举对策总部部长，领导展开竞选运动。浅沼和社会党东京都知事候选人有田八郎在演讲中着重揭露自由民主党政府的贪污和腐败，并表示社会党将为实现“廉洁的政治”而努力。他们并且表示，他们一定要争取宣布东京为和平城市。
    浅沼和有田一致呼吁市民警惕岸信介政府要把立川和新岛基地变成导弹基地的阴谋，并且指出这种危险的根源在于日美“安全条约”。
    另一方面，执政的自由民主党极力假借“和平”和“独立”的美名，散布欺骗性的谬论，并且大肆进行收买选票等贿选活动。因此，日本违反选举法的事件大量发生。到16日为止，因违反选举法而被捕的有一百二十九人，警察当局发出的警告已达一万零五百零五次。
