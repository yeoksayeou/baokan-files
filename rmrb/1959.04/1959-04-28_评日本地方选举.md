    A Commentary on the Japanese Local Elections
    The results of the Japanese unified local elections have been revealed. Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out that the results of the Japanese local elections prove that Japan's patriotic and democratic forces are advancing step by step in a down-to-earth manner. The Japanese Socialist Party also estimates that the local elections have made steady progress. In particular, the victories in Fukuoka and Ibaraki prefectures, and the emerging trend of breaking the control of the Liberal Democratic Party in some rural areas, are of special significance. It is undoubtedly entirely correct to measure the results of the Japanese local elections in this way. Under the close control of U.S. imperialism and Japanese potential imperialist elements, the mobilization of police pressure, and the bribery and enticement of financial groups with a large amount of money, only naive people can imagine that election victories can be smoothly achieved in central cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. Therefore, the Japanese people have actually achieved a victory in this local election, and its significance should not be underestimated. Only the Nobusuke Kishi group and the Liberal Democratic Party are boasting about the results of this local election. They have made a big fuss about the Liberal Democratic Party seizing the majority of governor positions in twenty prefectures in Japan, saying that it is a great victory for the Liberal Democratic Party in this local election, as if the unified local election held on April 23 was only to elect governors. Some leaders of the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party have even openly declared that the foundation of the Nobusuke Kishi regime has been "stabilized" due to the results of the local elections.
    However, facts show that these boasts of Nobusuke Kishi are nothing more than a trick. As everyone knows, the Japanese unified local elections are regular elections held every four years, in which the heads of local autonomous organizations and local council members are re-elected nationwide at the same time. The Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party have long intended to use the local elections held in April this year to replace the local governors of the Japanese Socialist Party and other democratic forces, and to greatly increase the number of Liberal Democratic Party members in local councils, in order to change the current local autonomy system implemented in Japan and establish a political rule system commensurate with the so-called "new era of Japan-U.S. relations" advocated by Nobusuke Kishi. At the beginning of this local election campaign, the Nobusuke Kishi group brazenly stated that the Liberal Democratic Party would occupy all the governor positions in Japan and increase a large number of local council members. In order to achieve this goal, the Nobusuke Kishi group, with the full support of his master, U.S. imperialism, and monopoly capital, used all despicable and dirty means. And all the bureaucratic politicians headed by Nobusuke Kishi in Tokyo and other places worked so hard that even the Japanese bourgeois newspapers sighed that it was "unprecedented." But what was the result? According to the vote count on the evening of the 24th, the Liberal Democratic Party not only failed to occupy all the governor positions in the twenty prefectures, but also failed to achieve its wishes in the four key areas (Tokyo, Osaka, Hokkaido, and Fukuoka) where conservative and progressive parties competed fiercely. Only a slight majority was obtained in Tokyo and Osaka, and a disastrous defeat was suffered in Fukuoka. Judging from the votes obtained by each party in this gubernatorial election: the Socialist Party had 4,147,575 votes; the Liberal Democratic Party had 3,061,253 votes; independents had 11,818,463 votes; and the Communist Party had 485,356 votes. The facts prove that the power of the Liberal Democratic Party is gradually weakening, while the democratic forces are gradually increasing. This situation is also clearly reflected in the election of local councils nationwide. According to the results of this election of council members in forty-six prefectures in Japan, the number of seats held by the Socialist Party in all local councils increased from 459 to 562, an increase of 103 seats compared to before the election. In particular, in the Fukuoka Prefectural Council, the Socialist Party, with 33 seats, overwhelmed the Liberal Democratic Party, which held 31 seats, and became the largest party. In the local councils of Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagano, Hokkaido, etc., the democratic forces have also exceeded one-third. The proportion of seats held by progressive forces in the national prefectural-level local councils has increased from one-fifth before the election to one-quarter. Conversely, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost 155 seats in the local councils. It can be seen that the great victory touted by Nobusuke Kishi and the Liberal Democratic Party is nothing but a bluff. In fact, it is not the Liberal Democratic Party that has truly achieved success in this election, but the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other patriotic and democratic forces that it has attacked so much.
    It should be pointed out that the achievements of the Japanese Socialist Party and other patriotic and democratic forces in this local election were achieved under very difficult conditions, and therefore are of particular importance. In Japan, this local election is generally regarded as the preliminary battle for the House of Councillors election to be held in June, and therefore has been highly valued by the Japanese monopoly capital represented by the Nobusuke Kishi government. Especially today, when the Japanese people strongly oppose the Nobusuke Kishi group's intensification of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and increasingly dragging Japan onto the road of war, and the reactionary conservative forces in the traditional strongholds of the Liberal Democratic Party are being weakened; the Nobusuke Kishi group and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have tried their best to reverse their decline through this election, and openly slandered and defamed the Socialist Party as "carrying out activities according to the instructions of Communist China." The Nobusuke Kishi group attempted to confuse the public and belittle the significant role played by the Socialist Party in Japanese political life in recent years due to its demands for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality; and eliminate the great influence that the Socialist Party has increasingly generated among the masses due to its efforts to improve Sino-Japanese relations. In the campaign activities, the Nobusuke Kishi group and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party spared no effort to abuse power and money, and used a series of despicable methods such as bribery and the use of the police to obstruct the election of candidates from democratic forces. It is reported that the Japanese monopoly capital group has allocated astronomical amounts of money for bribery for the Liberal Democratic Party to participate in this local election and the House of Councillors election. Before the Nobusuke Kishi government officially announced the start of the election campaign, Japanese monopoly capital had already spent 120 million yen on bribery and other illegal activities for the Liberal Democratic Party's Dong Longtaro to run for governor of Tokyo. On the eve of the vote, the Nobusuke Kishi government even illegally arrested the campaign cadres of the Japanese Socialist Party and other democratic forces under false pretenses. It also used the wedding of the Japanese Crown Prince to publicize and issue amnesties to expand its political influence.
    The various means used by the Nobusuke Kishi group and the Liberal Democratic Party that violate the Japanese election law have made this local election an "unprecedentedly dark election" in Japan. The victory of the Japanese Socialist Party and other patriotic and democratic forces under such circumstances powerfully demonstrates that the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other patriotic and democratic forces insist on implementing an independent, autonomous, peaceful, and neutral policy, smashing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system, restoring diplomatic relations between China and Japan, and improving the people's lives, which have increasingly gained the support of the Japanese people.
    Faced with ironclad facts, the Nobusuke Kishi group and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party stubbornly tout their own victory and publicize the "failure" of the Socialist Party, which is obviously with ulterior motives. In addition to making a show of force for themselves and openly criticizing the Socialist Party, they also attempt to sow discord among the Japanese patriotic and democratic forces represented by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, in order to weaken the progressive forces. Look, in the statement issued by the Liberal Democratic Party on the 24th, isn't it clearly publicized that one of the reasons for the "failure" of the Socialist Party is that it was "dragged down by the pro-Communist factions inside and outside the party"? The cunning of the Nobusuke Kishi group can be seen from this. However, just as the Japanese people will not change their support for the Socialist Party because of Nobusuke Kishi's vicious attacks, the Japanese patriotic and democratic forces, who have deeply realized the importance of unity in the struggle, will not be easily fooled by this kind of despicable divisive conspiracy. Such self-deceiving propaganda by the Nobusuke Kishi group and the Liberal Democratic Party is certainly futile; even the purpose of making a show of force cannot be achieved. Now, even within Japanese monopoly capital, some people believe that the Japanese political situation after the local elections "cannot be blindly optimistic." They admit that the "advantage" of the Liberal Democratic Party "is not necessarily a reflection of the general public's trust in Prime Minister Kishi, and the atmosphere of demanding that Prime Minister Kishi reflect is very strong."

    评日本地方选举
    日本统一地方选举结果已经揭晓。日本共产党总书记宫本显治指出，日本地方选举结果，证明日本爱国民主力量正在一步步脚踏实地地前进。日本社会党也估计这次地方选举是稳步取得的进展。尤其是福冈县和茨城县的胜利，以及在一些农村中开始出现了打破自由民主党把头控制下的框子的趋势，具有特别的意义。这样衡量日本地方选举的结果，毫无疑义是完全正确的。在美帝国主义和日本潜在帝国主义分子的严密控制，动员警察施加压力，和财阀使用大量金钱的收买利诱的情况下，只有天真的人才能想象像东京大阪这样的中心城市能够顺利地取得选举胜利。因此，日本人民在这次地方选举中，实际上是取得了一个胜利，对它的意义是不应低估的。只有岸信介集团和自由民主党正在就这次地方选举的结果大吹大擂。他们对自由民主党在日本二十个都、道、府、县的知事选举中攫取到多数职位这件事，大事宣扬；把它说成是自由民主党在这次地方选举中的巨大胜利，似乎4月23日举行的这次统一地方选举，仅仅是选举知事而已。岸信介政府和自由民主党的某些领导人甚至公开扬言，由于地方选举的结果，岸信介政权的基础已经“稳定”了。
    然而，事实说明，岸信介的这些大吹大擂不过是在玩弄一种障眼法。大家知道，日本统一地方选举是每四年举行一次的定期选举，在这个选举中同时改选全国地方自治机构的负责人和地方议会议员。岸信介政府和自由民主党久已有心通过今年4月举行的地方选举，刷清日本社会党和其他民主力量的地方知事，大力增加自由民主党在地方议会中的议员；以便改变目前日本实行的地方自治体制，确立一套同岸信介提倡的所谓“日美关系新时代”相称的政治统治体制。早在这次地方竞选活动开始之初，岸信介集团就曾大言不惭地表示自由民主党将全部占有日本全国各地的知事职位，并增加大量地方议员。为了实现这个目的，岸信介集团在他的主子美帝国主义和垄断资本的全力支持下，使用了一切卑鄙肮脏的手段。而以岸信介为首的一切官僚政客在东京以及各地简直卖力到连日本资产阶级报纸都叹为“从未曾有”的地步。但结果究竟如何呢？根据24日晚上的计票结果，自由民主党在这次二十个都、道、府、县的知事选举中，非但未能全部占有知事职位，连保守政党和进步政党激烈竞争的四个重点地区（东京都、大阪府、北海道、福冈县），也没有偿其所愿。东京和大阪仅仅取得微弱的多数，福冈还遭到了惨败。而就各政党在这次知事选举中得票的情况来看：社会党四百一十四万七千五百七十五票；自由民主党三百零六万一千二百五十三票；无党派人士一千一百八十一万八千四百六十三票；共产党四十八万五千三百五十六票。事实证明，自由民主党的力量是在逐步削弱，而民主力量却在逐步增强。这种情况同样明显地反映在全国地方议会的选举中。根据日本这次四十六个都、道、府、县议会议员的选举结果，社会党在所有地方议会中的议席从四百五十九席增加到五百六十二席，比选举前增加了一百零三席。特别是福冈县议会，社会党以三十三议席压倒了占有三十一议席的自由民主党，成为第一大党。在东京都、大阪府、京都府、长野县、北海道等地方议会里，民主力量也都超过了三分之一。进步力量在全国县一级地方议会里所占的议席比数已经从选举前的五分之一增加到四分之一。相反的，执政的自由民主党在地方议会中却丧失了一百五十五议席。由此可见，岸信介和自由民主党所极力鼓吹的巨大胜利，不过是虚张声势。实际上，真正在这次选举中取得成就的恰恰不是自由民主党，而是被它大肆攻击的社会党、共产党和其他爱国民主力量。
    应当指出，日本社会党和其他爱国民主力量这次地方选举的成就是在十分困难的条件下取得的，因而具有特别重要的意义。在日本，这次地方选举被普遍认为是将于6月举行的参议员选举的前哨战，因而得到以岸信介政府为代表的日本垄断资本的非常重视。尤其是在日本人民强烈反对岸信介集团加紧修改日美“安全条约”、把日本日益拖上战争道路，自由民主党在各传统地盘的反动保守势力正被削弱的今天；岸信介集团和执政的自由民主党竭力企图通过这次选举，挽回自己的颓势，公然诬蔑和诽谤社会党是“根据共产党中国的指示进行活动的”。岸信介集团企图以此混淆视听，贬低社会党近年来由于要求和平、独立、民主、中立，而在日本政治生活中发挥的显著作用；消除社会党因为努力改善中日关系而在群众中日益产生的巨大影响。在竞选活动中，岸信介集团和执政的自由民主党更不惜滥用权力和金钱，施展收买和利用警察等一系列的卑劣手法，阻挠民主力量的候选人当选。据报道，日本垄断资本集团，为自由民主党参加这次地方选举和参议员选举拨出了天文数字的收买费用。在岸信介政府正式宣布竞选开始以前，日本垄断资本为了自由民主党的东龙太郎竞选东京都知事，用于贿买和其它违法活动的选举费已达一亿二千万日元。在投票前夕，岸信介政府甚至假借名义非法逮捕日本社会党和其他民主力量的竞选干部。还利用日本皇太子的结婚大肆宣传并发布特赦来扩大政治影响。
    岸信介集团和自由民主党这种种违反日本选举法的手段，使这次地方选举成为日本“史无前例的黑暗选举”。日本社会党和其他爱国民主力量在这样的情况下取得胜利，有力地表明了日本共产党、社会党和其他爱国民主力量坚持执行独立自主和平中立的政策，粉碎日美“安全条约”体系，恢复中日邦交以及改善人民生活的主张，已越来越得到日本人民的支持。
    面对着铁一般的事实，岸信介集团和执政的自由民主党偏偏吹嘘自己的胜利，宣传社会党的“失败”，显然是别有用心的。他们除了为自己虚张声势，公开抨击社会党，还企图在以社会党、共产党为代表的日本爱国民主力量中间进行挑拨，以便削弱进步势力。请看，自由民主党在24日发表的声明中，不是明白宣传社会党“失败”的原因之一，就是因为它“被党内外的容共派拖着跑”吗？岸信介集团的诡计多端，由此可见。然而，正如日本人民不会因为岸信介的恶毒攻击而改变他们对于社会党的支持一样，在斗争中深刻体会到团结重要的日本爱国民主力量，也不会由于这种卑劣的分化阴谋而轻易上当。岸信介集团和自由民主党这类自欺欺人的宣传，肯定是徒劳无益的；甚至虚张声势的目的也达不到。现在，即使是日本垄断资本内部，一部分人也认为地方选举后的日本政局“不能一味地乐观”。他们承认自由民主党的“优势”“不一定就是一般群众信任岸首相的反映，而要求岸首相进行反省的空气很强”。
