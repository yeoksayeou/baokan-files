    The Heroic Algerian People's Struggle for Independence
    Xu Ba
      A Hundred-Year-Old Oath
    "…Our people can only feed you bullets. Even if you stay in our country for a hundred years, all your tricks will be useless to us." This was the oath issued by the Arab tribes of the Mascara region of Algeria in 1841 to the French invading forces in their final ultimatum. A hundred years have passed, and although the Algerian people have suffered from the oppression and enslavement of French imperialism during this period, they still inherit the cause of their ancestors and fight heroically to completely get rid of colonial rule and strive for national independence.
    Half a Century of Anti-French War
    Algeria is a country with a long history. Before the French invasion, Algeria was an independent country and had established diplomatic relations with many countries in the world (including France). However, in order to plunder Algeria's rich resources and enslave the Algerian people without restriction, French imperialism blatantly destroyed the friendly relations between the two countries and invaded Algeria in 1830. Since then, the glorious history of the Algerian people's successive struggles for national independence has unfolded.
    From the first day of the French invasion, the Algerian people launched a heroic anti-aggression struggle. The large-scale anti-French war led by Imam Abd-el-Kader lasted for fifteen years. At that time, the French colonists mobilized 100,000 troops, organized so-called "hell columns" and "death light infantry," and implemented a scorched-earth strategy to deal with the poorly armed insurgents. But the heroic insurgent people dealt a heavy blow to the French invaders. Although this epic anti-French struggle failed, it forever inspires the Algerian people's struggle. Today, the green and white flag with the red crescent and star of the Algerian National Liberation Army is the flag of Abd-el-Kader.
    From 1848 until the recent uprising, Algeria carried out a total of fifty anti-French uprisings. Among them, the most famous was the Great Kabylie Uprising in 1871 led by Muhammad Mokrani, which was attended by as many as 200,000 people. The Algerian people's anti-French war continued until 1890, that is, after about half a century of brutal war, France completely conquered Algeria.
      The November 1954 Uprising
    After World War I, especially after World War II, encouraged by the tremendous development of the socialist movement and the national independence movement worldwide, the Algerian national liberation movement developed vigorously. All Algerian nationalist parties, such as the Movement for the Victory of Democratic Liberties, the Association of Reformist Ulama, and the Democratic Union of the Algerian Manifesto, gradually united to form the National Liberation Front, pushing the national liberation movement to a new climax. Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, the Algerian people finally unveiled the armed struggle from victory to victory on November 1, 1954.
    When the Algerian people's armed forces began their uprising, there were only 3,000 guerrillas, using shotguns and dilapidated weapons. For almost two years after the uprising, the guerrillas' area of activity was limited to Tizi Ouzou in the northern Greater Kabylie region and the Aurès Mountains in the east. However, after 1956, the combat effectiveness of the National Liberation Army, which was warmly supported by the Algerian people, increased day by day, and the war zone expanded to the entire territory of Algeria, from the border of Tunisia in the east to the border of Morocco in the west, including the Aurès Mountains, Constantine region, Algiers region, Oran region, Kabylie region, and the desert region. Later, in order to adapt to the war situation, the National Liberation Army merged the six war zones into three major war zones: east, west, and central. Except for a few large cities, mines, railways, and highways, which are still occupied by the French colonial army, the rest have become areas of activity for the National Liberation Army.
    With the expansion of the liberated areas, the National Liberation Army has also continued to grow. This guerrilla force, originally composed of thousands of poorly equipped and scattered people, has now grown into a regular army of 130,000 people, and there are also 100,000 militiamen who can be mobilized at any time, as well as guerrillas all over the country. They have truly talented officers, personnel who are good at commanding guerrilla warfare and conducting modern military training. They have progressed from activities carried out by only a few people in the past to now being able to frequently concentrate forces of more than 5,000 people to attack French military positions. As for equipment, they seized the weapons and equipment of the French colonial army to equip themselves, and now they have many quite modern weapons, so they can carry out coordinated infantry and artillery operations and attack French bunkers and armored forces. The Maurice Line, which the French colonial army once boasted was "impenetrable," 300 kilometers long and half a kilometer wide between Algeria and Tunisia, was broken through by the National Liberation Army at the end of last year. At the same time, the air force of the Algerian National Liberation Army is also growing rapidly.
    A People's Army That Grows Stronger in Battle
    The Algerian National Liberation Army has grown from nothing, from small to large, and from weak to strong. This development process was carried out under extremely difficult conditions. At the beginning of the uprising, the French colonists had only 50,000 troops in Algeria, but now there are 600,000 regular troops and about 200,000 various security forces. The French colonial army not only greatly outnumbered the Liberation Army but also had modern weapons and equipment. It used its superior equipment to bomb and strafe the Algerian people, create "death no-man's lands," and even inhumanely implement a scorched-earth policy of burning, killing, and looting, attempting to cut off all sources of supply for the Algerian National Liberation Army. Moreover, this ferocious French colonizer has always received the support of US imperialism. But the Algerian National Liberation Army has not only not been suppressed, but its strength has grown day by day.
    The reason why the National Liberation Army has been able to grow and develop is that it is waging a just war, a war to liberate the motherland from French enslavement, and therefore it has received the support of all upright people inside and outside Algeria. The members of the Algerian National Liberation Army come from the people, especially the peasants, and the army and the people have formed a close relationship. The French military high command has also had to admit: the officers and soldiers of the Liberation Army come from local residents, "their parents, brothers, and sisters all agree with and support the army's fighting." An army that has the support of the people has become stronger and stronger through the tempering of battle.
  Consolidation and Development of Revolutionary Base Areas
    The National Liberation Army has done a great deal of work to consolidate the revolutionary base areas. As early as August 1956, the then leading body, the National Liberation Front, established military and political organs at various grass-roots units in accordance with the decisions of the People's Congress to direct operations and manage civil affairs. Each village and town has a democratically elected People's Council. The People's Council has departments of civil administration, justice, religion, finance, police, and health. At present, this kind of regime has been effectively established in two-thirds of the residential areas completely controlled by the National Liberation Army, especially in the mountainous areas. In the revolutionary base areas, peasants have been allocated land and have received agricultural loans from the revolutionary government to purchase seeds. The revolutionary government also attaches special importance to cultural, educational, and health work. Literacy campaigns have begun, and each village is required to establish a school, where children from the age of six to ten can receive compulsory education. Health work has greatly developed, such as hospitals and clinics have been established in some areas, and the poor can receive free treatment. At the same time, commerce and social welfare work have also been developed. With the development of political power construction, the people's lives have also improved. Such a base area has become a reliable rear base and source of development for the National Liberation Army.
    The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic last September has further strengthened the leadership of the revolutionary base areas and made the revolutionary regime more consolidated and developed. This is a reliable guarantee for the Algerian people's armed struggle for independence and freedom to advance from victory to victory.
    Supported by People All Over the World
    The struggle of the Algerian National Liberation Army has not only won the support of broad sections of the population at home but has also won the respect and support of the people of Arab countries and the peace and democratic forces of the world. Since the Algerian people launched their struggle for liberation, waves of support for the Algerian people's struggle have been surging around the world. The Bandung Asian-African Conference held in April 1955, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held last year, the African States Conference, the Maghreb Conference, and the All-African People's Conference have all repeatedly passed resolutions supporting the Algerian people's struggle for independence. After the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, it has been recognized by fourteen countries, including China.
    The just struggle of the Algerian people has dealt a heavy blow to French colonialism. According to incomplete statistics, in the past few years, the French colonial army, excluding its auxiliary forces, has suffered more than 100,000 casualties; from 1956 to 1958, France spent 2.1 trillion francs in the Algerian war. At present, the Algerian war costs France an average of 2 billion francs in military spending every day. As a result of persisting in the colonial war against Algeria, France's political and economic crisis has deepened and its international status has declined. Now, while intensifying the colonial war, the de Gaulle government is implementing a policy of merging Algeria, but this can never save it from its inevitable fate of failure. The heroic struggle of the Algerian people for independence and freedom has greatly inspired the national liberation movements in Arab, Asian-African, and Latin American countries, and is a major contribution to world peace.

    英雄的阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争
    徐拔
      一百年前的誓言
    “……我国人民只能让你们吃子弹。即使你们留在我国一百年不走，你们的一切诡计，对我们都毫无办法。”这是远在1841年阿尔及利亚的马斯喀拉区的阿拉伯部族对当时法国侵略军的最后通牒发出的誓言。一百年过去了，尽管在这期间阿尔及利亚人民受尽了法国帝国主义的压迫和奴役，但是他们仍然继承着祖先的事业，英勇不屈地为彻底摆脱殖民统治和争取民族独立而斗争。
    半世纪的抗法战争
    阿尔及利亚是一个有悠久历史的国家。在法国侵入之前，阿尔及利亚曾是一个独立国家，并且和世界上许多国家（包括法国在内）建立了外交关系。可是法帝国主义为了无限制地掠夺阿尔及利亚的富源和奴役阿尔及利亚人民在1830年悍然破坏两国的友好关系，侵入阿尔及利亚。从此展开了阿尔及利亚人民前仆后继地争取民族独立斗争的辉煌历史。
    从法国侵入的第一天起，阿尔及利亚人民就展开了英勇的反侵略斗争。在阿波德——卡德尔教长领导下进行的规模宏大的抗法战争，曾经坚持了十五年。当时，法国殖民者动员十万大军，组织所谓“地狱纵队”、“死亡轻步兵”，实行焦土战略，来对付武装窳陋的起义者。但英勇的起义人民给了法国侵略者以沉重的打击。这场可歌可泣的抗法斗争虽然失败了，但是它永远激励着阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。今天阿尔及利亚民族解放军的绿白两色红月红星旗，就是当年阿波德—卡德尔的旗帜。
    从1848年以后直到最近这次起义之前，阿尔及利亚一共进行了五十次反法起义。其中著名的如1871年由穆罕默德·莫克腊尼领导的卡比利大起义，参加的人数达二十万之众。阿尔及利亚人民的抗法战争一直延续到1890年才算结束，也就是说，经过了约半个世纪的残酷战争，法国才全部征服阿尔及利亚。
      1954年11月起义
    第一次世界大战特别是在第二次世界大战以后，由于受到世界范围的社会主义运动和民族独立运动巨大发展的鼓舞，阿尔及利亚民族解放运动有了蓬勃的发展。阿尔及利亚的一切民族主义政党争取民主自由胜利运动、贤哲会、阿尔及利亚宣言民主联盟等逐渐团结起来，组成了民族解放阵线，把民族解放运动推向一个新的高潮。在民族解放阵线的领导下，阿尔及利亚人民终于在1954年11月1日揭开了从胜利走向胜利的武装斗争。
    阿尔及利亚人民的武装力量开始起义的时候，仅有三千个游击队员，使用的是猎枪和破旧的武器。在起义后差不多两年的时间里，游击队活动的地区还仅限于北部的大卡比利地区的蒂齐·乌佐和东部的奥雷斯山区。然而到1956年以后，这支受到阿尔及利亚人民热烈支持的民族解放军的战斗力日益加强，战区扩大到阿尔及利亚全境，东抵突尼斯西至摩洛哥边界，包括了奥雷斯山区、君士坦丁区、阿尔及尔区、阿兰区、卡比利区和沙漠区等六个战区。以后民族解放军为适应战争形势，把六个战区合并为东西中三大战区。除了若干大城市、矿山、铁路和公路等点、线仍由法国殖民军盘据以外，其余都成为民族解放军的活动地区。
    随着解放区的扩大，民族解放军也不断壮大。这支原来由几千人组成的装备极差并分散在各地的游击队现在已成长为拥有十三万人的正规军，并且还有十万名随时可以集中的民兵队伍以及遍布全国各地的游击队员。他们拥有真正有才干的军官，拥有善于指挥游击战争和进行现代化军事训练的人才。他们由以前少数几个人进行活动到现在可以经常集中五千人以上的部队进攻法军阵地。至于装备，他们夺取了法国殖民军的武器装备了自己，现在他们已拥有许多相当现代化的武器，因而能够实行步炮兵的协同作战，进攻法军的碉堡和装甲部队。法国殖民军一度吹嘘为“不可突破的”在阿尔及利亚和突尼斯之间的长三百公里宽半公里的摩里斯防线，就曾在去年底被民族解放军所突破。同时阿尔及利亚民族解放军的空军部队也在迅速成长。
    愈战愈强的人民军队
    阿尔及利亚民族解放军就是这样由无到有、由小到大、由弱到强。而这一发展过程是在极其艰难的条件下进行的。在起义开始的时候，法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚还只有五万军队，但是现在已有六十万正规军和二十万人左右的各种保安部队。法国殖民军不仅在人数上大大超过解放军，而且在装备上也都是现代化的武器。它利用着优势的装备向阿尔及利亚人民进行轰炸扫射，制造“死亡的无人地带”，甚至灭绝人性地实行烧光、杀光、抢光的焦土政策，企图切断阿尔及利亚民族解放军的一切供应来源。而且这个凶恶的法国殖民者一直得到了美帝国主义的支持。但是阿尔及利亚民族解放军非但没有被镇压下去，而且力量日益壮大。
    民族解放军之所以能够成长、壮大，是由于它在进行的是正义的战争，是为了把祖国从法国奴役下解放出来，因而它得到阿尔及利亚内外的一切正直的人民的支持。阿尔及利亚民族解放军的成员来自人民，特别是农民，军队和人民之间结成了血肉关系。法军最高统帅部也不得不承认：解放军官兵来自当地居民，“他们的父母、兄弟和姐妹都赞同和支持这支军队的战斗。”得到人民支持的军队，经过战斗的锻炼，已愈来愈强大了。
  革命根据地的巩固和发展
    民族解放军对巩固革命根据地进行了巨大的工作。早在1956年8月的时候，当时的领导机构民族解放阵线就根据人民代表大会的决定，在各个基层单位建立了军政机构，指挥作战和管理民政。每个村镇设有民选的人民会议。人民会议下设民政、司法、宗教、财经、警察和卫生等部门。目前这种政权已经在民族解放军完全控制的三分之二的居民区中特别是山区有效地建立起来。在革命根据地，农民已经分到了土地，并且领到了革命政权发放的购买种籽的农业贷款。革命政权还特别重视文教卫生工作。扫盲工作已经开始，每个村庄规定要建立一个学校，自六岁到十岁的儿童都可以受到义务教育。卫生工作有很大发展，如在有些地区已经设立了医院和诊疗所，贫民还可以免费治疗。同时商业和社会福利工作也得到了发展。随着政权建设的发展，人民的生活也得到了改善。这样的根据地就成了民族解放军的可靠的后方基地和发展源泉。
    去年9月，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，更进一步加强了对革命根据地的领导，使革命政权更加巩固和发展。这是阿尔及利亚人民争取独立自由的武装斗争从胜利走向胜利的可靠保证。
    得到全世界人民的支持
    阿尔及利亚民族解放军的斗争不仅获得了国内广大阶层的支持，而且也赢得了阿拉伯各国人民和全世界和平民主力量的尊敬和支持。自从阿尔及利亚人民展开争取解放的斗争以后，全世界各地就掀起了一个又一个声援阿尔及利亚人民斗争的浪潮。在1955年4月举行的万隆亚非会议、去年举行的亚非人民团结大会、非洲国家会议、马格里布会议和全非人民大会等都一再通过决议，支持阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立后，已得到包括中国在内的十四个国家的承认。
    阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，已给以法国殖民主义者以沉重的打击。据不完全统计，在过去几年中，法国殖民军不包括它的辅助部队在内，已经伤亡十万人以上；从1956年到1958年法国在阿尔及利亚战争中花去了二万一千亿法郎。目前阿尔及利亚战争平均每天要花去法国二十亿法郎的军费。法国由于坚持对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争的结果，已使它的政治经济危机日益加深，国际地位日益下降。现在戴高乐政府在加紧殖民战争的同时，实行合并阿尔及利亚的政策，但这决不能挽救它的必然失败的命运。阿尔及利亚人民争取独立自由的英勇斗争，大大鼓舞着阿拉伯和亚非、拉丁美洲各国民族解放运动，并且是对世界和平的重大贡献。
