　　"Longevity Star" Blast Furnace Remains Strong
　　Hechuan Steel Plant's No. 1 Blast Furnace Well-Maintained, High Output
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Chongqing, April 17th) The workers of No. 1 Blast Furnace at Hechuan Steel Plant in Sichuan Province, recognized as the "oldest" small blast furnace at the National Small Blast Furnace Conference, are now making further efforts to strengthen blast furnace maintenance, striving to avoid major repairs this year and make greater contributions to exceeding the national plan.
    This blast furnace is an old furnace with a volume of 35 cubic meters, expanded in June 1955. It has been producing normally ever since. Its furnace age has now reached three years and nine months, with an average utilization coefficient of around 1, and a coke ratio reduced to below 1. Due to the long furnace age and smooth operation, it has overfulfilled the pig iron production plan every year, and the cost per ton of pig iron has been reduced to 130 yuan.
    The main experience of this blast furnace in achieving longevity and high yield is to prioritize political and ideological work. As early as when the blast furnace was overhauled and completed in 1955, the plant's Party committee promptly put forward the target of a two-and-a-half-year furnace age for this generation, calling on workers to strengthen maintenance and pointing out a clear goal for the workers to strive for. By June of last year, a major overhaul should have been carried out, but under the inspiration of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the call of the plant's Party committee to "fight hard for a year and increase the furnace age," the workers waged a tenacious struggle to maintain the life of the blast furnace. They strengthened measures to spray water to cool the hearth and belly plates, installing two rows of cold water spray pipes on the blast furnace plates, which were kept running continuously. Workers cleared away scale as soon as it appeared on the plates. Wind nozzles, slag tapping holes, and iron tapping holes were frequently inspected and repaired, and sprayed with water for cooling. In terms of operating technology, a strict shift handover system was implemented, with the shift leader conducting an inspection during each shift handover. If any unqualified areas were found, they were immediately repaired. The charging process adopted a system where the edge gas flow was slightly higher than the center, to prevent excessive edge temperatures from damaging the furnace wall. At the same time, the amount of limestone used was reduced, the slag ratio was lowered, and the corrosion of the furnace wall by slag was prevented.
    Since Sichuan Province launched a steel production surge campaign in March this year, all the workers of this blast furnace have dispelled the idea of a quarterly major overhaul, seized the time to produce, and striven to extend the furnace age by another year, to win the "longevity" red flag for small blast furnaces.

### “寿星”高炉老当益壮  合川钢铁厂一号高炉维护好产量高

　　“寿星”高炉老当益壮
　　合川钢铁厂一号高炉维护好产量高
    本报重庆17日电　在全国小高炉会议上被公认为小高炉“老寿星”的四川省合川钢铁厂一号高炉的职工，目前正再接再厉，加强高炉维护工作，力争今年不大修，为超额完成国家计划作出更大的贡献。
    这座高炉是1955年6月扩建成的三十五立方公尺的老炉子，一直生产正常，到现在炉龄已达三年零九个月，平均利用系数为一左右，焦比降低到一以下。由于炉龄长、炉况顺行，历年来都超额完成了生铁生产计划，每吨生铁成本降低到一百三十元。
    这座高炉长寿丰产的主要经验，是政治思想工作先行。早在1955年高炉检修完工时，厂党委就及时向全体职工提出了本代炉龄二年半的指标，号召职工加强维护，给职工指出了明确的奋斗目标。到去年6月，本来应该进行大检修，但在党的社会主义建设总路线和厂党委提出的“苦战一年，增长炉龄”的号召鼓舞下，职工们对维护高炉寿命作了顽强的斗争，加强了喷水冷却炉缸和炉腹围板的措施，在高炉围板上装了两排冷淋水管，长期不断地开着；围板生了水垢，工人们随时加以清除。对风嘴、出渣口和出铁口，经常检查维修，并喷水冷却。在操作技术方面，严格执行交接班制度，每班交班时由班长进行检查。如发现不合格的地方就立即进行修补。装料采用边缘煤气流稍高于中心的装料制度，以防止边缘热度过高，损坏炉壁。同时减少石灰石用量，降低渣比，防止了炉渣浸蚀炉壁。
    今年3月，四川省展开钢铁突击运动以后，这座高炉的全体职工又打消了季度大检修的念头，抓紧生产，力争再延长炉龄一年，夺取小高炉“长寿”红旗。
