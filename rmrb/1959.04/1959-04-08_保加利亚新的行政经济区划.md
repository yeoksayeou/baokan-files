Bulgaria's New Administrative and Economic Zoning

    The elections for administrative and economic regions and township people's committees held throughout Bulgaria on April 5th were conducted to adapt to the new administrative zoning recently implemented in Bulgaria. This reorganization of administrative and economic zoning is a major measure taken by Bulgaria to improve economic management. Its purpose is to make the state management organs more adapted to the tremendous changes that have taken place in Bulgaria's national economy in recent years, while simplifying state management organs, bringing them closer to the grassroots level, in order to maximize local initiative and accelerate the pace of socialist construction.

    In order to greet Bulgaria's greater economic leap forward and simplify and improve state management organs, the Bulgarian National Assembly issued an order on January 22nd, based on the suggestions made by Comrade Zhivkov in his report outline, regarding changes in administrative zoning. In this reorganization of administrative zoning, it was decided to abolish the thirteen states and one hundred and seventy counties and units of equal status throughout the country, and establish thirty administrative and economic regions as basic-level administrative and economic units, including three municipalities directly under the central government equivalent to administrative and economic regions. The new zoning has two levels: regions and townships. Since this reorganization is essentially a shift from the principle of management by sector to the principle of management by region, each administrative and economic unit after the reorganization will formulate a comprehensive economic development plan for its respective region and manage the national education, health care, and cultural life of its respective region. However, centralized planning, centralized mobilization of funds, and centralized allocation of resources will still be maintained in the important directions of national economic development.

    After the reorganization, most of the administrative and economic regions, which have been re-divided, have roughly equal land areas and populations. In addition, the historical and natural conditions of each region, especially the development prospects of these regions, and other political factors were also considered during the division. The area of the new administrative and economic regions ranges from 2,000 to 8,000 square kilometers, with a population of about 200,000 to 700,000. More than half of the regions have an average of 30 to 50 industrial enterprises. Most of the regions account for about 2% to 5% of the country's total industrial output. After this reorganization of administrative and economic zones, Bulgaria abolished seven central ministries, so the various specialized ministries and competent authorities will transfer some of the practical powers of leading the national economy to local organizations. Comrade Zhivkov pointed out in his report outline on accelerating national economic development that the transfer of the national economic center to the local level will bring the economic leadership closer to enterprises and production, which will be of great significance for developing local economic potential, solving urgent problems in a timely and rapid manner, and enhancing the enthusiasm of the people and mobilizing them to participate in state management.

    The basic economic production unit in agriculture in the administrative and economic region will be the agricultural production cooperative. Rural handicraft production cooperatives and some existing local industrial enterprises will also be merged into this expanded agricultural production cooperative. The basic production unit in industry in the administrative and economic region is the industrial enterprise, which will be directly under the leadership of the people's congress of the administrative and economic region. In order to make fuller use of the full potential of industry, similar enterprises in the republic and local industries will be merged.

    保加利亚新的行政经济区划
    4月5日保加利亚在全国各地所进行的行政经济区和乡人民委员会的选举，是为了适应不久前保加利亚所开始实行的新的行政区划而举行的。这次行政经济区划的改组，是保加利亚为了改善经济管理而采取的一项重大措施。它的目的是为了使国家管理机构更加适应近年来保加利亚在国民经济方面所发生的巨大变化，同时简化国家管理机构，使它们更加接近基层环节，以便最大限度地发挥地方积极性，加快社会主义建设的速度。
    为了迎接保加利亚经济上的更大跃进，简化和改善国家管理机构，保加利亚国民议会在今年1月22日根据日夫科夫同志在他的报告提纲中所提出的建议，发布了关于变更行政区划的命令。在这次行政区划的改组里，决定撤销全国的十三个州和一百七十个县以及平级的单位，建立三十个行政经济区作为基层行政经济单位，其中包括有三个相当于行政经济区的直辖市。新的区划共分区和乡两级。由于这次改组实质上是从按部门管理的原则转变为按地区管理的原则，因此改组后的每个行政经济单位将单独制订各该地区的全面经济发展计划，并管理各该地区的国民教育、保健和文化生活。但是在发展国民经济的重要方向上，仍将保持着集中的计划，资金的集中调动以及资源的集中支配。
    改组后经过重新划分的大部分行政经济区的土地面积和人口，都是大致相等的。此外，在划分时还考虑到了每个区的历史、自然条件，特别是这些区的发展远景和其他一些政治因素。新的行政经济区的面积为二千到八千平方公里，人口从约二十万到七十万。一半以上的区里平均拥有三十个到五十个工业企业。大部分的区约占全国工业总产量的2％到5％。在这次行政经济区划改组后，保加利亚共撤销了七个中央部，因此各专业部和主管机关将把一些实际领导国民经济的职权交给地方组织。日夫科夫同志在关于加速国民经济发展的报告提纲中指出，国民经济中心转到地方后，就使得经济领导机构接近了企业和生产，这样将对发展地方经济潜力，及时迅速地解决亟待解决的问题，提高人民群众的积极性和发动他们参加国家管理有着巨大的意义。
    行政经济区在农业方面的基本经济生产单位将是农业生产合作社，农村的手工业生产合作社和一部分现有的地方工业企业，也将合并到这种扩大了的农业生产合作社里去。行政经济区在工业方面的基本生产单位是工业企业，这些企业将直属行政经济区人民会议领导。为了更充分地利用工业的全部潜力，共和国和地方工业的同类企业将要进行合并。
