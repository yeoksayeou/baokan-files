Talking about "General Talent" Shan Wensheng

At first glance of this title, perhaps everyone will mistakenly think I am here to discuss military issues, but that is not the case. I am just talking about this issue in a general sense.

What is "general talent"? I think this refers to leadership ability, including various different natures of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, as well as work in all aspects of the Party, government, military, and people. No matter what work is done, within a range of varying sizes, some people must bear certain leadership responsibilities, and they need to possess a certain "general talent." In this way, "general talent" is not mysterious at all, but can be encountered anytime and anywhere in daily work. We should cultivate a large number of "general talents," popularize "general talent," and make them serve the broad masses of people and the socialist cause.

I don't know who was the first person to talk about "general talent." As far as I know, it was Sun Wu, an out-and-out military strategist in ancient China, who systematically discussed the issue of "general talent." It is difficult to determine now whether this military strategist of the Spring and Autumn Period really wrote the "Thirteen Chapters on the Art of War." However, according to research, seven or eight out of ten parts of this book were deleted, supplemented, and reorganized by Cao Cao, based on Sun Wu's fragmented writings. This credit should be recorded in Cao Cao's account, which is the right thing to do.

Sun Wu was naturally a great general talent of ancient times, while Cao Cao, compared to Sun Wu, was an even more comprehensive general talent. He was not only a great military strategist, but also a great politician and a great writer. In Cao Cao's edited "Sun Tzu's Art of War," there is a famous saying that can be regarded as a definition of "general talent." This is: "The general is wise, trustworthy, benevolent, brave, and strict."

This definition can be said to be the initial theoretical summary of "general talent." The proposal of this definition was a rare initiative under the historical conditions at that time. However, from our perspective today, this definition is certainly incomplete and far from meeting our requirements. Because history has advanced for more than a thousand years, the relationship between our generals and soldiers, generals and generals, and soldiers and soldiers has undergone earth-shaking changes with the transformation of the socio-economic foundation that forms these relationships. No matter how brilliant the ancients were, they could not be compared with us in any way. Therefore, we must re-examine the ancients' arguments from today's perspective, interpret them critically, absorb some of their essence, and discard their dross, in order to achieve the purpose of serving the present with the past.

In our view now, the so-called "wisdom" means requiring a leader to be resourceful and decisive; to be good at exchanging opinions with the people around him, especially to be able to humbly listen to opposing opinions; to be good at observing the situation, and to be able to make decisive decisions. Such a leader must not only have a high level of political understanding; but also have rich practical experience and various knowledge, be able to flexibly use theoretical principles to guide practice, and in turn, enrich the treasure trove of theory.

The so-called "trustworthiness," as we see it now, not only requires leaders to lead by example and gain the trust of the people; but also requires leaders to do what they say, faithfully implement the Party's guidelines and policies, implement the Party's decisions and instructions, be honest and realistic, not exaggerate or minimize achievements and shortcomings, tell the truth, do practical things, and unify our infinite loyalty to the Party and our absolute responsibility to the people, and unify the long-term interests of socialism and communism with the immediate interests of the people.

The so-called "benevolence," in our view now, is the fearless spirit of sacrificing everything, even one's own life, for the great cause of revolution and construction. We must unconditionally obey the truth, and we must resolutely fight against everything that violates the truth, without any mercy or favoritism.

The so-called "bravery" is not only daring to take responsibility, not being afraid of difficulties, not being dejected because of setbacks in work, not blaming others or fate, and not retreating or evading the arduous struggle of reality; but also actively working hard to complete tasks, fully exerting one's creativity, daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and persevering in the revolution to the end.

The so-called "strictness" also has several aspects of meaning, that is: to adopt a serious and responsible attitude towards all problems, not ambiguous, not perfunctory, not equivocal, not prevaricating; in the face of major issues of right and wrong, the attitude should be especially clear, the position should be clear and firm, the boundaries between right and wrong should be clearly distinguished, never compromising on the wrong, and fully supporting the right; the requirements in work should be strict, with rewards and punishments, strict discipline, and close supervision and inspection, opposing liberalism.

The era we are in now is more than 1,700 years away from Cao Cao, and more than 2,500 years away from Sun Wu. Their experience at that time is certainly far from comparable to today. We are not people who value the past over the present, and we will never worship the ancients, especially Cao Cao. The reason why I say these words is nothing more than to achieve the goal of serving the present with the past, so that people today know that the ancients had already paid attention to leadership talent and accumulated a lot of rich experience. Shouldn't we pay more attention to the art of leadership, cultivate more leadership talents, and serve the great cause of socialist construction?

专栏：

　　谈“将才”单文生
    一看见这个标题，也许大家会误认为我是来谈论军事问题的，其实不然。我只是从一般的意义上来谈这个问题。
    什么是“将才”呢？我以为这是指的领导才能，包括工农商学兵各种不同的性质和党政军民各方面的工作都在内的。不管做什么工作，在大小不等的范围之内，总要有一些人担负一定的领导责任，他们就需要具备一定的“将才”。这样说来，“将才”毫不神秘，而是日常工作中随时随地可以遇见的。我们应该培养大批的“将才”，普及“将才”，使他们为广大人民服务，为社会主义事业服务。
    最早谈论“将才”的人不知是谁。据我所知，在中国古代有系统地谈论“将才”问题的倒是一个不折不扣的军事家——孙武子。这位春秋时代的军事家是否真的著了“兵法十三篇”，现在很难断定。但是，据考证，这部书十之七八是由后来的曹操依照孙武的零篇断简，加以删削补充整理而成的。这笔功劳应该记在曹操的账上，才是正理。
    孙武自然是古代的大将才，而曹操比起孙武，却是更全面的将才。他不但是大军事家，而且是大政治家，大文学家。在曹操整理的“孙武子兵法”中，有一句名言可以看成是关于“将才”的定义。这就是说：“将者，智、信、仁、勇、严也。”
    这个定义可以说是关于“将才”的最初的理论概括。这个定义的提出，在当时的历史条件下是难能可贵的创举。但是，由我们今天的眼光看来，这个定义当然是不完全的，十分不能符合我们的要求。因为历史前进了一千几百年，我们今天的将帅和士兵、将帅和将帅、士兵和士兵之间的关系，随着形成这些关系的社会经济基础的变革，已经发生了翻天覆地的改变。不管古人多么高明，他们无论如何是不足以与我们相比拟的。所以我们必须从今天的角度去重新研究古人的论点，加以批判性的诠释，吸取其中某些精华，而扬弃其糟粕，以达到古为今用的目的。
    在我们现在看来，所谓“智”，就是要求一个领导人员足智多谋，英明善断；要善于与自己周围的人交换意见，特别是要能虚心听取相反的意见；要善于观察形势，而又能当机立断。这样的领导人员不但要具有高度的政治水平；而且要有丰富的实际斗争经验和各种知识，能够灵活地运用理论原则去指导实践，又反过来充实理论的宝库。
    所谓“信”，这在现在看来，不但是要求领导人员能够以身作则，取信于民；而且要求领导人员说到哪里就做到哪里，忠实地执行党的方针和政策，贯彻实现党的决定和指示，老老实实，实事求是，不夸大也不缩小成绩和缺点，说实话、干实事，把我们对于党的无限忠诚和对人民的绝对负责精神统一起来，把社会主义和共产主义的长远利益，与人民群众的眼前利益统一起来。
    所谓“仁”，在我们现在看来，这就是为了革命和建设的伟大事业而不顾牺牲自己的一切，甚至牺牲自己的生命也在所不惜的那种大无畏精神。对于真理，我们要无条件地服从，而对于一切违反真理的，就必须坚决进行斗争，毫不容情，毫不徇私。
    所谓“勇”，这不但是要敢于负责，不怕困难，不因为工作受到挫折而垂头丧气，不怨天尤人，不退缩和逃避现实的艰苦斗争；而且要积极地为完成任务而奋勇工作，充分发挥自己的创造性，敢想、敢说、敢干，坚持革命到底。
    所谓“严”，也有几方面的意义，就是说：对待一切问题要采取严肃认真的态度，不含糊，不苟且，不模棱两可，不敷衍搪塞；在大是大非的面前，态度尤其要明确，立场鲜明而坚定，把是非的界线划分得清清楚楚，对于错误的决不妥协，对于正确的全力支持；在工作中要求严格，有赏有罚，纪律严明，并且抓紧督促检查，反对自由主义。
    现在我们所处的时代，与曹操相距一千七百多年，与孙武相距二千五百多年，他们那时候的经验当然远远不足以比拟于今天。我们更不是厚古薄今者流，绝对不会去崇拜古人，尤其不会去崇拜曹操。我所以说出这一篇话，无非是想做到古为今用，让现在的人们知道，古人早已注意领导的才能，积累了许多丰富的经验，我们难道还不应该更加注意领导的艺术，培养更多的领导人才，为社会主义建设的伟大事业服务吗？
