　　Seeking Key Measures Through Uninhibited Airing of Views and Debate
　　Launching a Production Upsurge in Tianjin Factories by Implementing the Spirit of Rectification

　　(Reported by our newspaper) The broad masses of workers and staff in Tianjin are currently engaging in uninhibited airing of views and debate, focusing on the production tasks of their respective units, expressing opinions, proposing measures, exposing contradictions, and tapping production potential. A more vibrant and lively political situation has emerged in the factories, propelling the production surge forward.

　　Under the leadership of the District Party Committees of the Chinese Communist Party, various factories have openly shared their "bottom line" with the workers and staff, and then boldly mobilized them to engage in uninhibited airing of views and debate around the question of how to realize this year's Great Leap Forward.

　　In the past few days, the airing of views and debate in many factories has reached a climax. The broad masses of workers and staff have been expressing their opinions to their hearts' content in order to better complete their production tasks. At group meetings and discussion forums, veteran workers, grassroots cadres, and activists have been vying to speak, and many factories have been plastered with various kinds of big-character posters. According to preliminary statistics from seventeen factories in Hedong District, workers and staff have expressed more than 73,000 opinions. Statistics from fifteen factories in Hexi District show that more than 28,000 big-character posters were put up on the day before yesterday alone.

　　In order to enable the workers and staff to air their views thoroughly and deeply and to express all their opinions, the leadership of many factories has repeatedly mobilized the workers and staff in conjunction with sharing the "bottom line". In addition to mobilizing workers and staff to air their views at group meetings, some factories have also held discussion forums for different types of people, such as veteran workers, grassroots cadres, and technical personnel, opening up new venues for airing views. The leaders of units such as the XinXing Steel Factory and the GuangKai Paper Mill took the lead in putting forward opinions on their work, encouraging everyone to air their views. Party and government leading cadres of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory went to the workshops and groups to listen to the workers' opinions. The broad masses of workers and staff truly achieved freedom of speech, and the tens of thousands of opinions they put forward around production pointed out the potential and improvement measures; at the same time, they also exposed problems in enterprise management and shortcomings in the leadership style. Workers and staff of the First Workshop of GuangKai Paper Mill put up many big-character posters against problems such as unreasonable labor organization and inappropriate personnel arrangements, demanding that the leadership make serious improvements. Some units also launched debates on different opinions in the airing of views. In the airing of views, veteran workers, grassroots cadres, and activists played a huge role. With their rich practical experience, they put forward pertinent opinions on tapping production potential and solving key problems. Due to the realization of "surrounding disc production" in the Third Workshop of the Third Steel Rolling Mill, production has increased a lot, bringing about the problem of insufficient handling and packaging capacity. When the leadership shared the "bottom line" with the workers and staff this time, they raised this problem and mobilized everyone to think of solutions. In the airing of views, four veteran workers, Wei Zhaode, Liang Zhubin, Liu Youcun, and Sun Yuting, collectively studied this key issue and put forward a total of six plans for the leadership to choose from, and finally determined two of them. According to the methods they proposed, the original dropping of the rebar, one disc at a time, was changed to two discs at a time, greatly improving the efficiency of handling and packaging.

　　While actively carrying out the airing of views, seeking key measures, and proposing measures, the broad masses of workers and staff are also implementing the measures as they propose them, so that new production achievements are constantly emerging. Shao Weiji and Wang Jinming, veteran workers of the Fifth Workshop of the WeiJin Chemical Factory, suggested using the idle calendering machine to solve the key problem of insufficient pressure equipment, and they personally experimented and put it into production quickly, which increased the daily output of a certain plastic product sixfold. It is expected that the production task for the second quarter can be completed in April.

　　Through the uninhibited airing of views and debate by the broad masses of workers and staff, many leading cadres of factories have also been educated, their thinking has been improved, and their confidence has been strengthened. In the manufacture of hydro-generators in Tianjin Power Equipment Factory, due to the large model and lack of technical experience, some leading cadres had little confidence. The leadership of this factory handed over this batch of tasks to the workers and mobilized them to air their views, propose measures, and seek key solutions. The workers of the whole factory were full of confidence, and the next day they put forward several hundred innovation suggestions, and many measures were implemented on the same day. The factory director said with emotion: "As long as we resolutely rely on the masses, share the bottom line with the masses, and solve any difficulties."

### 大鸣大放找关键提措施  天津各厂贯彻整风精神掀起生产高潮

　　大鸣大放找关键提措施
　　天津各厂贯彻整风精神掀起生产高潮
    本报讯　天津市广大职工正在围绕本单位的生产任务，发议论、提措施、揭露矛盾、挖掘生产潜力，进行大鸣大放。工厂中出现了更加生动活泼的政治局面，推动生产浪潮滚滚向前。
    各工厂在中共区委的领导下纷纷向职工交“底”，接着放手发动职工围绕如何实现今年的大跃进，展开大鸣大放大辩论。
    这几天，许多工厂的鸣放已经进入高潮。广大职工围绕更好地完成生产任务，尽情地发表自己的意见。在小组会、座谈会上，老工人、基层干部、积极分子都争先恐后地发言，很多工厂贴满了各式各样的大字报。据河东区十七个工厂的初步统计，职工鸣放意见已达七万三千多件。河西区十五个工厂统计，前天一天就贴出大字报两万八千多张。
    为了使职工群众鸣深放透，把所有的意见都发表出来，许多厂领导上都结合交“底”，向职工进行反复动员。有些厂除了发动职工在小组会上鸣放以外，还召开了老工人、基层干部、技术人员等不同类型的座谈会，开辟了新的鸣放园地。新兴钢厂、广开造纸厂等单位的领导都带头提出了工作中的意见，鼓舞大家的鸣放。天津自行车厂的党、政领导干部分头深入车间、小组，倾听工人们的意见。广大职工真正做到了畅所欲言，围绕生产提出的数以万计的意见，指出了潜力所在和改进措施；同时，他们也揭发了企业管理当中的问题和领导作风上的缺点。广开造纸厂一车间职工针对劳动组织不够合理、人员安排不当等问题贴了许多大字报，要求领导认真改进。有些单位，还针对鸣放当中的不同意见展开了辩论。在鸣放当中，老工人、基层干部、积极分子发挥了巨大作用。他们以自己丰富的实践经验，在挖掘生产潜力、解决关键问题方面提出了中肯的意见。轧钢三厂三车间由于实现了“围盘化”，生产提高了很多，带来了搬运、包装能力不足的问题。这次领导上向职工交底时，把这个问题提出来，发动大家想办法。在鸣放中，魏兆德、梁柱斌、刘有村、孙玉亭等四位老工人，围绕这项关键集体研究，一共提出了六个方案交给领导上选择，最后确定了两项。根据他们提出的办法，把原来落盘条由一盘一落改为两盘一落，使搬运、包装效率大大提高。
    广大职工在积极开展鸣放、找关键，提措施的同时，还边提边干，动手实现措施，使生产新成就不断涌现。卫津化工厂第五车间的老工人邵维辑、王金明建议使用闲置的压延机来解决压力设备不足的关键问题，并亲自动手试验，很快就投入生产了，使一种塑料制品的日产量提高了六倍，预计第二季度的生产任务，4月份就可以完成。
    通过职工群众大鸣大放，也使不少工厂领导干部受到了教育，提高了思想，坚定了信心。天津发电设备厂在制造水轮发电机中，由于型号较大，又缺乏技术经验，有的领导干部信心不大。这个厂的领导上把这批任务交给了职工，发动职工大鸣大放，提措施、找关键，全厂工人信心十足，第二天就提出了革新建议好几百条，许多措施在当天就落实了，这个厂的厂长感动地说：“只要坚决依靠群众，向群众交清底，多大的困难也能解决。”
