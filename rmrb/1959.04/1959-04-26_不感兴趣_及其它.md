	"Not Interested" and Other Things
	Zhong Huai

When discussing the Tibet issue, Mrs. Pandit, the Indian High Commissioner in London and Prime Minister Nehru's sister, actually said in London: "I am not interested in China's rule over Tibet."

The words were spoken to reporters. This is not merely a private monologue, but a public declaration.

So, what is Mrs. Pandit interested in? This lady is relatively restrained and doesn't say it directly. However, another well-known figure in Indian political circles, the Socialist leader Narayan, said the following: among Asian countries, only India can "help" Tibet achieve peaceful reform in a way that "conforms to the interests of Tibetans." It seems that this passage just reveals what Mrs. Pandit did not say directly.

It is only natural and not at all surprising that expansionists are "not interested in China's rule over Tibet." However, if they also want to raise the banner of "Panchsheel" and turn around to accuse China of "violating the spirit of Panchsheel," it is particularly ridiculous.

Indian expansionists are said to be so fanatical about the rebellion in Tibet because Indians and Tibetans have a special "spiritual connection."

Religious and cultural ties between the Indian people and the Tibetan people of China naturally exist and have a long history. However, the "spiritual connection" that expansionists constantly emphasize does not refer to this. If it really did, would the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion cause even the slightest damage to the religious and cultural ties between the Chinese and Indian peoples, requiring Indian expansionists to flex their muscles to maintain them?

Certainly not. As Master Xirao Jiacuo said, the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" forcibly issued by the Dalai Lama, who was held hostage by the rebel group in Tezpur, India, is completely different from the Dalai Lama's statements over the past eight years, and is exactly the same as the old tune of Tibetan independence constantly issued by imperialists and foreign reactionaries. You see, one side is "not interested in China's rule over Tibet," and the other side is colluding with foreign countries, facing India and turning its back on the motherland. This is not just a "spiritual connection," it's practically wearing the same pants. Isn't the answer to why Indian expansionists are clamoring so hysterically about the failure of the Tibetan rebels right here?

Speaking of spirit, one cannot help but think of matter. Indian expansionists emphasize the spiritual connection between Indians and Tibetans, so what about the material connection?

An article in the Japanese "Akahata" on April 4 had some introductions. The newspaper said that in the past, Indian merchants had always made exorbitant profits by exploiting the Tibetan people of China. They used their collusion with the upper-level reactionary groups in Tibet and the inconvenient transportation in Tibet to sell daily necessities at high prices and buy Tibetan wool at low prices, making profits of 300% to 800%. However, after the liberation of Tibet, they could only make a profit of 3% or 4% on the sale of goods. The newspaper said that it cannot be denied that such merchants have influence in the Indian parliament.

So that's how it is! In the end, matter determines spirit. Understanding this "material connection" will make one feel that the "spiritual connection" emphasized by Indian expansionists is not a tree without roots or water without a source.

Of course, Indian expansionists are not happy to make public the suffering of this "material connection." They try their best to put on makeup, as if they are really compassionate and fighting for the freedom and happiness of the Tibetan people, rather than enjoying privileges in Tibet and taking more things from the pockets of Tibetans.

However, "our Tibetan people have strong Buddhist beliefs and even sharper wisdom eyes" (Xirao Jiacuo). Who can be fooled by this clumsy disguise of Indian expansionists? If you don't believe it, please prick up your ears and listen to the huge voices of the Tibetan representatives on the National People's Congress rostrum these days!

    “不感兴趣”及其它
    锺怀
    谈到西藏问题，印度驻伦敦高级专员、尼赫鲁总理的妹妹潘迪特夫人在伦敦居然说：“我对中国统治西藏不感兴趣”。
    话是对新闻记者说的。这就不只是内心的独白，而是当众的扬言了。
    那么潘迪特夫人感到兴趣的是什么呢？这位夫人还算比较含蓄，没有直说。不过另一位印度政界的知名人士——社会党领袖纳拉扬却说了下面一段话：在亚洲国家中，只有印度能够以“符合西藏人利益的方法”来“帮助”西藏实现和平改革。看来，这段话刚好道出了潘迪特夫人所没有直说的东西。
    扩张主义分子“对中国统治西藏不感兴趣”，是理所当然，丝毫也不奇怪的。不过如果还想打起“潘查希拉”的旗帜，反咬一口，说中国“违反了潘查希拉的精神”，那就特别叫人感到滑稽了。
    印度的扩张主义分子所以对西藏的叛乱表现得如此狂热，据说是因为印度人和西藏人有着特别的“精神联系”。
    印度人民和中国的西藏人民之间的宗教和文化联系自然是存在的，而且有着长久的历史。不过扩张主义分子口口声声强调的“精神联系”，并非指此。要真是指的这个，难道中国政府平定了西藏叛乱，对于中印人民之间的宗教和文化联系有一丝一毫损伤，需要印度的扩张主义分子磨拳擦掌加以维护吗？
    非也。喜饶嘉错大师说得好，受叛乱集团挟持的达赖喇嘛，在印度提斯浦尔被迫发表的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，同达赖喇嘛八年来的言论完全不同，同帝国主义及外国反动派不断发出的西藏独立的陈腔谰调则如出一辙。你看，一方是“对中国统治西藏不感兴趣”；另一方是里通外国，向着印度，背着祖国。这岂止是“精神联系”，简直是穿上一条裤子了。印度扩张主义分子对西藏叛匪的失败所以这样声嘶力竭地叫嚣，答案不就在这里么？
    提到精神，不免想起物质。印度的扩张主义分子强调印度人和西藏人的精神联系，那么物质联系又如何呢？
    日本“赤旗报”4月4日的一篇文章中有过一些介绍。这家报纸说，印度的大商人过去一直高利盘剥中国的西藏人民。他们利用和西藏上层反动集团的勾结，利用西藏交通不便的情况，高价卖出日用品，低价收购西藏的羊毛，获利达300％到800％。可是西藏解放以后，他们出卖商品只能获利3％或者4％。报纸说，不能否认，这类商人对印度议会是有影响的。
    原来如此！到底还是物质决定精神。了解这种“物质联系”，对印度扩张主义分子所强调的“精神联系”就不会感到是无本之木、无源之水了。
    当然，印度的扩张主义分子是不乐于把这种“物质联系”方面的苦衷公之于世的。他们尽力涂脂搽粉，好像自己真是慈悲心肠，为了西藏人民的自由和幸福而斗争，而不是为了在西藏享受特权、从西藏人的口袋里掏去更多的东西似的。
    但是，“我们藏族人民有强烈的佛教信仰，更有锋利的慧眼”（喜饶嘉错），印度扩张主义分子这种拙劣的打扮又骗得了谁？不信，请把耳朵竖起，听一听这几天全国人民代表大会讲坛上藏族代表的巨大的声音！
