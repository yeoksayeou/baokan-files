Then, they presented mandalas (a kind of precious offering) and hadas to Panchen Erdeni. Panchen Erdeni also affectionately touched heads with Xi Rao Jia Cuo (a most intimate etiquette), and gave each of the other people who came to pay homage a blessing by touching their heads and presented them with "blessing" knots (a kind of red silk ribbon).

After the homage ceremony, Panchen Erdeni had a cordial conversation with the people who came to pay homage to him. Panchen Erdeni said: "I hope that Buddhists, under the leadership of the Party, will love the motherland. I believe that the National Buddhist Association, under the leadership and care of the Party, will do its work better." Xi Rao Jia Cuo told Panchen Erdeni about the specific situation of religious life and material life of Buddhists across the country being taken care of under the care of the Party. Finally, Xi Rao Jia Cuo also expressed cordial greetings to Panchen Erdeni on behalf of Buddhists across the country. On April 15, more than 20,000 Lhasa citizens solemnly held a demonstration demanding the complete suppression of the rebellion.
