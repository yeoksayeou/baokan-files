Fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report." I will now summarize my inspection findings as follows:

During my inspection in Hebei Province, I first went to Tianjin and visited the Hongshunli Urban People's Commune, the Tractor Factory, the May First Watch Factory, the Bicycle Factory, the Power Machine Factory, the First Machine Tool Factory, and the Steel Rolling Mill No. 1. All are large-scale and produce excellent products. I also inspected the Shengfang Depression transformation and the Tianjin Haihe River renovation project. The miracles I witnessed were truly exciting and thought-provoking. Some factories, during last year's Great Leap Forward, exerted great effort, strived for excellence, and exhausted their intelligence to seek technological innovation. Often, things they couldn't manufacture themselves in the past are now being made by them. This is an extremely progressive achievement, contributing to building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, blossoming everywhere and shining brightly. However, factories inevitably encounter difficulties in terms of business responsibilities and material usage. But these difficulties are temporary and not long-lasting. If the whole country acts as one, each doing their best, and material allocation is determined according to their assigned business production responsibilities, it naturally won't be a problem.

The Tianjin Haihe River is the main channel for the confluence of five major rivers—the South Grand Canal, the Ziya River, the Daqing River, the Yongding River, and the North Grand Canal—into the sea. Every summer, when floods from these five rivers occur simultaneously, Tianjin city is bound to be flooded. Furthermore, years of river siltation have made the Dagukou harbor shallow, and seagoing ships must wait for high tide to enter. Also, Tianjin's sewage and drainage systems all flow into the Haihe River. In spring and autumn, when the water level drops, seawater intrudes, mixing with sewage, making it salty, bitter, and dirty, and unsuitable for use. During the reactionary government era, although Haihe River renovation was repeatedly discussed, no good plans were made. Now, within half a year of our government's rule, a dam has been built inside the mouth of the Haihe River. Diversion canals are being excavated on both banks of the Haihe River. On the left bank diversion canal, a tide prevention gate is being built, with complete settings. On the right bank diversion canal, a fishing boat lock is being built to facilitate fishing boat access. With the completion of this gate and dam project, the Haihe River's water level will rise, and the salty seawater will not be able to flow into the river, separating salt water from fresh water. Furthermore, the entire city's sewage system has been consolidated into six systems, and large horseshoe-shaped pipelines have been constructed, connecting over 200 kilometers. From now on, all city sewage will no longer flow into the Haihe River, diverting clear water from turbid water. In addition, at the confluence of the South Grand Canal, Ziya River, and Daqing River in the upper reaches of the Haihe River, the Xibei River gate is being built, turning Dongdianzi into a reservoir, preventing silt from the three rivers from flowing into the Haihe River. With the Haihe River now under control both upstream and downstream, the size of floods can be controlled by humans. From now on, not only will flood damage be avoided, but water conservancy benefits will also be obtained. This grand project, completed by the government leading the masses in a short period, demonstrates the great power of the Party's leadership combined with the masses, which is truly astonishing and unforgettable. The entire project has now been completed. According to locals, there are plans to excavate another seagoing ship lock river to the right of the New Port seagoing ship lock river, which can allow 10,000-ton seagoing ships to navigate the Haihe River and dock at the city's wharves. If this plan is feasible, it should be promoted for early realization to complete the entire effort.

From Tianjin, I went to the Baoding Special District and inspected Anguo and Xushui counties, and then to the Shijiazhuang Special District. In these two special districts, I visited factories and people's communes. Among the factories, the Baoding Chemical Fiber Factory and the Shijiazhuang North China Pharmaceutical Factory are the largest in scale. The Fiber Factory has not yet fully started production. The Pharmaceutical Factory went into full production last year and is divided into three major parts: an antibiotics factory, a starch glucose factory, and a glass factory. The glass factory specializes in manufacturing bottles and tubes of various sizes, which are used for the factory's equipment storage. According to factory personnel, the various products are not considered excellent because boron sand must be added to the glass to make it strong and beautiful. This raw material is currently lacking. The starch factory requires the most corn as raw material every day, and white corn is best. I think that after last year's Great Leap Forward, imbalances are expected to occur temporarily, but a solution will soon be found. The quality of raw materials will not be a problem. Now, during the spring planting season, there is an opportunity to solve the raw material problem. The Hebei Provincial People's Committee should notify the people's communes in each county to consider their situation and plant more white corn. After the autumn harvest, the procurement can be specially used by the pharmaceutical factory as raw material. In terms of human consumption, there is no significant difference between white corn and yellow corn. As for boron sand, according to the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory, Xinjiang and Qinghai both have boron sand mines, which should be identified and mined for use by glass and enamel factories.

During my inspections everywhere, I saw that land that was originally dry land has now become paddy fields. Especially in Anguo and Xushui counties, the land is as flat as a mirror, with ridges as straight as lines, divided into square fields of thousands to tens of thousands of mu, which can be used to plant various crops. In addition to river water and spring irrigation, most of the fields are irrigated by machine wells using drainage machines. With this situation, rural water conservancy and electrification can be realized soon. However, among the fields I saw in the local area, there are still many old brick wells that use waterwheels or winches to irrigate the fields. This requires a lot of labor, and only a few mu can be irrigated each day. If machine wells and drainage machines are used, dozens of mu can be irrigated. The provincial and municipal governments should urge the people's communes in each county to drill machine wells, install drainage machines, and delineate the area around the wells to facilitate irrigation. If the county and commune's economic strength is insufficient, the provincial and municipal governments should provide support. If this is done, in two or three years, electricity can be used to power water conservancy and irrigate farmland everywhere, so that rural electrification can be realized soon. The few opinions I mentioned above are, of course, things in the government's plan. I am mentioning them because I want to talk about what I saw during my inspection, so I am mentioning them incidentally. Whether they are feasible can be regarded as a matter for research.

### 咸淡分家，清浊分流  李培基委员谈视察兴修海河水利

    咸淡分家，清浊分流
    李培基委员谈视察兴修海河水利各位委员：
    我对周总理的“政府工作报告”十分拥护，今将我视察的事实概述如下：
    我此次到河北省视察，先至天津，参观了鸿顺里城市人民公社，拖拉机制造厂，五一表厂，自行车厂，动力机厂，第一机床厂，轧钢一厂等。都是规模宏大，产品精良。并视察胜芳洼地改造与天津海河改造工程。所见到的各项奇迹，实在令人兴奋，可发深省。有的工厂在去年的大跃进中，鼓足干劲，力争上游，竭尽智能，务求技术革新。往往过去不能自行制作的东西，现在也由自己制造出来了。这是一个极其进步的事迹。为多快好省地建设社会主义、遍地开花、大放异彩。但各厂在业务责任上、材料使用上，难免不发生困难。不过这种困难问题，本是属于暂时的情形，并非长久的现象。若果全国一盘棋，各尽其所能，按照他所分担的业务生产的责任、决定材料的分配使用，自然不成为问题。
    天津海河，为南运河、子牙河、大清河、永定河、北运河五大河流入海的要道。每至夏季，五河洪水齐发，天津市区必被水灾。且历年河沙淤积，大沽海口水浅，海船须俟潮满方能进口。又天津市区的污水、下水道都通入海河，春秋水落，海潮内侵，与污水混合，咸苦污秽不利使用。在反动政府时代，虽屡议兴修海河，终无良谋。现在我政府未到半年期间，在海河口内，建筑拦河大坝。于海河两岸另行开挖引河，左岸引河上，建筑防潮闸，设置实在完备；右岸引河上，建筑渔船闸，便利渔船出入。此项闸坝工程完成，海河水位提高，海潮的咸水不能流入河内，使咸水淡水分了家。又将天津全市下水道，归纳为六条系统，修建马蹄式的大管道，连接起来有二百多公里。全市污水从此不再流入海河，使清水浊水各自分流。此外，又在海河上游，南运河、子牙河、大清河的会流处，建筑西河闸门，使东淀子成为水库，三河泥沙不再流入海河。而海河上下皆有了管束，洪水的大小可以由人操纵。从此不但免除水害，并可得到水利。是此宏大工程，政府领导群众在短促期限即能大功完成，这是党的领导与群众相结合的伟大力量，实在是令人惊悟感念不尽。今全部工程已经竣事，据地方人云，尚计划在新港海船闸河的右边，再开挖一条海船闸河，可以通行万吨的海船，由海河航行直到市区码头停泊。此计划如果可行，应促其早日实现，以竟全功。
    我由天津到了保定专区，视察了安国、徐水两县，又到了石家庄专区，在这两个专区，参观的都是工厂及人民公社。在工厂则以保定化学纤维厂，石家庄华北制药厂，规模最为宏大。纤维厂尚未全部开始生产。制药厂于去年全部投入生产，全厂分为三大部分，一为抗生素厂，二为淀粉葡萄糖厂，三为玻璃厂，此厂专以制造大小瓶管等品，备为本厂装置存储的用具。据厂方人云，各项产品，不算是十分精良，因为制造玻璃须要加入硼砂，方能品质坚美，此项原料，现感缺乏。又淀粉厂，每日需用原材料，最多的为玉米，且用白玉米为最好。我想经过去年的大跃进，不平衡的现象，是一时间应有的情形，不久必能得到解决的办法。原料的质量不成为问题。惟现在春耕的时候，正为解决此项原料问题的机会。应由河北省人民委员会通告各县人民公社，酌量情况，多种白玉米，一俟秋收征购，专备药厂充作原料。在人民食用方面，白玉米黄玉米实无有很大的区别。至于硼砂，据石家庄搪瓷厂的人说，新疆、青海皆有硼砂矿，应即查明开采，以备玻璃搪瓷各厂应用。
    我在各处视察，沿途所见到的早年原为旱地，现在已成为水田。尤其是安国、徐水两县，真是地平如镜、埂直如线，分成由千亩至万亩的方田，可以分类播种各项的农作物。田地除了河水泉源灌溉，多半是机器井，用排水机灌溉。是此情形，农村水利化、电气化，不久就可实现。惟在地方所见田地中，仍是旧日砖井很多，用水车或辘轳浇田，大部分需要劳力，并且每日浇地不过数亩，若用机井排水机器，可以浇田数十亩。应即由省市督促各县人民公社，一律穿凿机井，安置排水机器，划成井周围的区田，以便灌溉。若是县社经济力量不足，省市方要加以支持。如此办理完成，二、三年内，到处皆可用电力发动水利灌溉田亩，使农田电气化可以早日实现。我在上边所说的几点愚见，当然为政府计划中的事情，我因为要说说我视察的事实，所以连带说及，是否可行，不妨视为研究的问题。
