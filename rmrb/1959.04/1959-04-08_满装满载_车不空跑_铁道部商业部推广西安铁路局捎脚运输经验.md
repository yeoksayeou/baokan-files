Xi'an, April 7th (By our reporter) The employees of the Xi'an Railway Bureau have created a complete set of experiences in incidental transportation (transporting goods without requiring additional vehicles or loading and unloading time is called incidental transportation). This integrates and develops measures such as non-detachment operations, mixed loading of light and heavy goods, and the utilization of return trips, greatly tapping the potential of railway transportation. This provides a new method for solving the current shortage of transportation capacity. The Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee jointly held an on-site meeting on incidental transportation in Xi'an to promote this advanced experience nationwide.

The main point of the incidental transportation experience is to use returning empty cars, freight cars with insufficient weight or volume, cabooses used by conductors, baggage cars, and railcars used for railway maintenance to transport goods or passengers, while ensuring the normal and safe operation of trains. Due to the comprehensive implementation of incidental transportation work, the Xi'an Railway Bureau has greatly reduced and eliminated the phenomenon of cargo backlog and freight yard congestion. Less-than-carload (LCL) cargo is basically loaded as soon as it arrives. Without increasing the number of vehicles, a large number of essential production and daily necessities are delivered to the places where they are most needed, strongly supporting the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. From November of last year to March 20th of this year, this railway bureau has used all available vehicles to transport more than 96,300 tons of goods and 244,900 passengers, equivalent to saving 4,561 freight cars and 245 passenger trains.

The implementation of incidental transportation by the Xi'an Railway Bureau proves that it has many advantages. First, it can fully tap the potential of railway transportation and transport large quantities of goods in a timely manner without increasing the number of vehicles, solving the problem of LCL cargo backlog that has long existed in the railway sector. Before November of last year, the Weinan Station had a backlog of many goods for more than one or two months. After the implementation of incidental transportation, it basically achieved "every car is fully loaded, every trip is not empty, goods are loaded on the same day they arrive, achieving a daily clean sweep."

Second, it better implements the transportation policy of ensuring both key points and taking care of general needs. It can use the main transportation force to complete the transportation of key materials, and also incidentally transport non-staple foods into cities and daily necessities to rural areas.

Third, incidental transportation has greatly strengthened the cooperation between various types of work within the railway, between the railway and commercial departments, and other consigning units. In the past, there was insufficient coordination between railway dispatching departments and stations, between stations, and between transportation and loading and unloading work. In particular, conflicts often occurred between trains and stations. For example, conductors, fearing delays, often emphasized that there were no cargo spaces and were unwilling to load more; when stations loaded goods onto cars, they often affected continued loading due to irregular stacking. After the implementation of incidental transportation, conductors and freight handlers took the initiative to contact the station, requesting to load more goods, and personally participated in loading and unloading; stations sometimes sent people with the train to clear cargo spaces and made preparations for loading and unloading in advance to ensure the on-time departure of the train.

At this on-site meeting, representatives from the railway bureaus and commercial departments (bureaus) of twenty-three provinces and cities unanimously agreed that incidental transportation is a revolution in railway transportation work. It has not only caused great changes in regulations and systems and transportation organization work, but also caused some major changes in internal and external relations of the railway, and the thinking of cadres and the masses. These changes are very beneficial to the greater leap forward in railway transportation this year. The meeting believes that if this experience is promoted nationwide, it will greatly improve the transportation capacity of the railway sector. According to relevant departments, the national railways have about 10,000 empty cars returning every day. If only 10% of these empty cars are used to incidentally transport goods, it can increase the number of freight cars by 1,000 every day.

The meeting decided that in promoting this experience nationwide, incidental transportation should not only be carried out between stations within a railway bureau, but also between bureaus, in order to further tap the potential of railway transportation. (Picture attached)

### 满装满载　车不空跑  铁道部商业部推广西安铁路局捎脚运输经验

    满装满载　车不空跑
    铁道部商业部推广西安铁路局捎脚运输经验
    本报西安7日电　西安铁路局职工创造了一套完整的捎脚运输经验（不另要车辆，不另要装卸时间把货物运走，叫做捎脚运输），把铁路运输的不摘车作业、轻重货物拼装、回空利用等措施合而为一，并且加以发展，大大发掘了铁路运输潜力，为解决当前运输力量不足的问题，提供了新的办法。铁道部、商业部和陕西省人民委员会联合在西安召开了捎脚运输现场会议，向全国推广这种先进经验。
    捎脚运输经验的主要点，是在保证列车正常安全运行的条件下，利用回送空车、不足重量或容积的货车、车长工作用的守车、行李车、铁路维修工作用的轨道车等装运货物或旅客。西安铁路局由于全面开展了捎脚运输工作，大大减少和消灭了货物积压和货场堵塞现象，零担货物基本上做到随到随装，在不增加车辆的情况下，把大量生产和生活必需品及时送到了最需要的地方，有力地支援了工农业大跃进。从去年11月到今年3月20日，这个铁路局利用一切可以利用的车辆捎脚运输货物九万六千三百多吨，货车带人二十四万四千九百多人，等于节约货车四千五百六十一辆和旅客列车二百四十五列。
    西安铁路局实行捎脚运输，事实证明有很多好处。首先，能充分挖掘铁路运输潜力，在不增加车辆的情况下，及时把大批货物运输出去，解决了铁道部门长期存在的零担货物积压的问题。渭南车站在去年11月份以前，有很多货物积压一、两个月以上；开展捎脚运输以后，基本上做到“车车满载走，趟趟不落空，当天货物当天装，达到天天一扫光”。
    第二，更好地贯彻了既保证重点又照顾一般的运输方针。既能用主要运输力量完成重点物资的运输，又能捎带着将副食品等运进城市，将日用百货等运往农村。
    第三，通过捎脚运输大大加强了铁路内部各工种之间、铁路与商业部门及其他托运单位之间的协作。过去铁路调度部门与车站之间、车站与车站之间、运输与装卸等工种之间，配合联系不够密切，尤其是列车和车站之间经常发生矛盾。例如车长怕拖长时间，常常强调没有货位，不愿多装；车站往车上装货物时，也常常由于堆放不整齐，影响了继续装货。实行捎脚运输后，车长和货运员主动同车站联系，要求加装货物，并亲自参加装卸；车站有时派人随车腾空货位，并且事先做好装卸准备工作，保证列车正点开行。
    在这次现场会议上，二十三个省、市的铁路局和商业厅（局）的代表一致认为，捎脚运输是铁路运输工作上的一个革命，不但引起了规章制度、运输组织工作上的大变化，也引起铁路内外关系、干部和群众思想上的一些重大变化，而这些变化十分有利于今年铁路运输的更大跃进。会议认为，如果在全国范围内推广这个经验，将大大提高铁路部门的运输能力。据有关部门计算，全国铁路每天回送空车一万辆左右，如果只利用其中10％的空车捎运货物，每天就能增加货车一千辆。
    会议决定在向全国推广这个经验中，不仅要在一个铁路局内各站之间开展捎脚运输，还要在局与局之间开展，以便进一步把铁路运输潜力挖掘出来。（附图片）
