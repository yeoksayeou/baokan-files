Under the Leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Diligent Efforts of All Ethnic Groups, and the Selfless Assistance of the Soviet Union and Other Brotherly Countries:
Our Country's First Five-Year Plan Achieves Brilliant Success
　　By the end of 1957, the Five-Year Plan had been overfulfilled, with infrastructure investment reaching 55 billion yuan, and more than 10,000 new and expanded industrial and mining enterprises and units; total industrial output value increased by 141%, and total agricultural and sideline output value increased by 25%; in the total industrial and agricultural output value, the proportion of industry and handicrafts increased to 56.5%.
　　Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: The State Statistical Bureau issued a "Communique on the Results of the Implementation of the First Five-Year (1953 to 1957) Plan for the Development of the National Economy" on the 13th (the full text of the communique can be found on the second page).
　　The communique stated that our country began implementing the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy in 1953. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and through the diligent efforts of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, it was successfully overfulfilled by the end of 1957. The successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan has enabled our country to achieve great achievements in both socialist transformation and socialist construction. Significant changes have taken place in our country's socio-economic structure and the face of the national economy.
　　The communique published the completion and over-completion of various plans in our country during the First Five-Year Plan in seven parts. These parts are: (1) Socialist Transformation; (2) Basic Construction; (3) Industrial Production; (4) Agricultural Production; (5) Transportation and Posts and Telecommunications; (6) Domestic and Foreign Commerce; (7) People's Material and Cultural Life.
　　The communique detailed the great achievements made by our country in basic construction and industrial production during the First Five-Year Plan. The communique stated that the total amount of basic construction investment completed nationwide in five years reached 55 billion yuan. Most of the construction projects stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan have been completed, and many new construction projects have been added. More than 10,000 industrial and mining construction units have been put into construction within five years. Due to the commissioning of a large number of newly built and expanded enterprises, the backwardness of old China's industry has begun to change. In terms of industrial production, the total industrial output value in 1957 exceeded the original five-year plan by 21%, an increase of 141% compared to 1952. The original plan averaged an annual increase of 14.7%, but actually reached 19.2%, while the growth rate in 1956 reached 31.1%. The total output value of handicrafts in 1957 increased by 83% compared to 1952, with an average annual increase of 12.8%. The rapid development of industrial production has significantly changed the status of industry in the national economy. The proportion of total industrial and handicraft output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 41.5% in 1952 to 56.5% in 1957. Of the 46 major products stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, 27 had already reached the 1957 level in 1956. During this period, the national industrial sector produced many new industrial products that our country had never had before.
　　Regarding agricultural production, the communique stated that although agricultural production has suffered natural disasters of varying degrees in the past five years, the vast number of organized farmers across the country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have given full play to their high level of enthusiasm and creativity, waged arduous struggles against natural disasters, and achieved significant victories.
　　In 1957, the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations of farmers completed 101% of the original plan, an increase of 25% compared to 1952, with an average annual increase of 4.5%. The total grain output reached 370 billion catties, completing 102% of the original five-year plan, an increase of 20% compared to 1952. The total cotton output reached 32.8 million dan, completing the plan, an increase of 26% compared to 1952. Comparing the total output of the five years with the five years from 1932 to 1936, when the harvests were better before liberation: grain increased by more than 410 billion catties, an increase of approximately 32%; cotton increased by more than 76 million dan, an increase of approximately 1.2 times.
　　The communique pointed out that with the development of production, the material and cultural living standards of the people of our country have also been significantly improved. By the end of 1957, the number of employees in our country had reached 24.51 million, and a large number of unemployed people left over from old China had been basically resettled. In 1957, the average wage of employees nationwide reached 637 yuan, an increase of 42.8% compared to 1952. On the basis of the development of agricultural production, the lives of more than 500 million farmers have been gradually improved. In 1957, the income of farmers nationwide increased by nearly 30% compared to 1952. Education has greatly developed. Within five years, a total of 560,000 students were enrolled in universities, a total of 1.12 million students were enrolled in secondary vocational schools, a total of 8.75 million students were enrolled in ordinary middle schools, and a total of 88 million students were enrolled in primary schools. Mass education, spare-time cultural learning, and literacy work have all made great progress.
　　The communique concluded that the economic construction and cultural construction during the First Five-Year Plan were unprecedented feats in our country's history, and the achievements made were significant. However, because our country's original economy was very backward, even today after the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan, our country's industry is still not strong enough, and the development of agricultural production cannot fully meet the growing needs of industrial production and people's lives. In order to further fundamentally change the backwardness in our country's economy and culture, the people of the whole country, under the guidance of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, are full of confidence and are striving forward to realize our country's more magnificent Second Five-Year Plan.

　　党中央和毛主席的领导　各族人民的辛勤努力　苏联等兄弟国家的无私援助
　　我国执行第一个五年计划成绩辉煌
    到1957年底已经超额完成五年计划，基建投资达五百五十亿元，新建扩建一万多个工矿企业单位；工业总产值增长141％，农副业总产值增长25％；在工农业总产值中，工业和手工业的比重提高到56.5％
    新华社13日讯　国家统计局13日发表了“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年（1953年到1957年）计划执行结果的公报”（公报全文见第二版）。
    公报说，我国从1953年开始执行的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，在中共中央和毛主席的领导下，经过全国各族人民的辛勤努力，并且得到了苏联和其他兄弟国家的援助，到1957年底已经胜利地超额完成了。第一个五年计划的胜利完成，使我国在社会主义改造和社会主义建设两个方面都取得了巨大的成就。我国社会经济结构和国民经济面貌已经发生了重大的变化。
    公报分七个部分公布了第一个五年计划期间我国各方面计划的完成和超额完成的情况。这些部分是：（一）社会主义改造；（二）基本建设；（三）工业生产；（四）农业生产；（五）运输邮电；（六）国内外商业；（七）人民的物质生活和文化生活。
    公报详细地叙述了第一个五年计划期间我国在基本建设和工业生产方面取得的巨大成就。公报说，五年内，全国完成的基本建设投资总额达到五百五十亿元。第一个五年计划规定的建设项目，绝大部分都已建成，并且增加了很多新的建设项目。五年内施工的工矿建设单位达一万个以上，由于大批新建和扩建企业的投入生产，开始改变了旧中国工业的落后面貌。在工业生产方面，1957年工业总产值超过原定五年计划21％，比1952年增长141％。原定计划平均每年增长1.47％，实际达到19.2％，而1956年的增长速度达到31.1％。1957年手工业总产值比1952年增长83％，平均每年增长12.8％。工业生产的迅速发展，使工业在国民经济中的地位发生了显著的变化。在工农业总产值中，工业及手工业总产值所占的比重由1952年的41.5％提高到1957年的56.5％。五年计划规定的四十六种主要产品，有二十七种在1956年就已经达到1957年的水平。在这个期间，全国工业部门生产了许多种我国从来所没有的新的工业品。
    关于农业生产，公报说，五年来，农业生产虽然遭受了不同程度的自然灾害，但组织起来的全国广大农民，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，对自然灾害作了艰苦的斗争，获得了重大的胜利。
    1957年农业和农家副业总产值完成原定计划101％，比1952年增长25％，平均每年增长4.5％。粮食总产量达到三千七百亿斤，完成原定五年计划102％，比1952年增长20％。棉花总产量达到三千二百八十万担，完成了计划，比1952年增长26％。五年产量合计与解放前收成较好的1932到1936年五年比较：粮食增加四千一百余亿斤，约增加了32％；棉花增加七千六百余万担，约增加了一点二倍。
    公报指出，随着生产的发展，我国人民的物质生活水平和文化生活水平，也有了显著的提高。1957年底，我国职工人数已经达到二千四百五十一万人，旧中国遗留下来的大批失业人员已经基本上得到了安置。1957年全国职工的平均工资达到六百三十七元，比1952年增长42.8％。在农业生产发展的基础上，五亿多农民的生活得到了逐步的提高。1957年全国农民的收入，比1952年增加近30％。教育事业有很大发展，五年内，高等学校共招生五十六万人，中等专业学校共招生一百一十二万人，普通中学共招生八百七十五万人，小学共招生八千八百万人。群众办学、业余文化学习、扫盲工作都有了很大的发展。
    公报最后说，第一个五年计划期间的经济建设和文化建设，是我国历史上的空前壮举，获得的成就是很大的。但是由于我国原来的经济十分落后，所以即使在第一个五年计划胜利完成后的今天，我国的工业还不够强大，农业生产的发展还不能完全满足工业生产和人民生活日益增长的需要。为了进一步地从根本上改变我国的经济和文化的落后面貌，全国人民在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导下，正满怀信心，为实现我国更宏伟的第二个五年计划而奋勇前进。
