    The Era of National Regional Autonomy in Tibet Begins
    Zong Zidu, Guo Chaoren
    In the Xuesecheng Linka in Lhasa, there stands a tall building with a golden roof and upturned eaves, built in the Tibetan architectural style. This is the office building of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Over a million Tibetan people watch it with concern and trust, while a small group of reactionaries see it as a thorn in their side.
    In the two years leading up to the Lhasa rebellion, figures like Suokang Wangqingele, Liu Xia Tudengtaba, Xianka Jumeduojie (Xiasu), Gazhang Luosangrizeng, and Pala Tudeng Weideng could often be seen in this building. They sat on the committee seats, attending meetings and working on the surface, talking eloquently and wearing deceitful smiles, while secretly plotting various schemes of sabotage. Therefore, for a long time, the road ahead for the Preparatory Committee was fraught with hidden reefs, making progress difficult, and paralyzing the overall institution. During the rebellion in March of this year, it was these very people—Suokang, Liu Xia, Xiasu, Gazhang, Pala…—who gathered rebel forces to surround the Potala Palace, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and even more brazenly sabotaged the Preparatory Committee. Despite seeing that over 90% of the members of the Preparatory Committee were Tibetans, they still denigrated the Preparatory Committee as a “Jiaxiong” (Han Chinese organ), threatening Tibetan personnel working in the agency to withdraw and "repent and reform," or face murder. However, in a short time, the traitorous elements who hated the implementation of national regional autonomy by the Tibetan people have embarked on the path of destruction, and the Preparatory Committee has become stronger and more united than ever before.
    On April 8, under the chairmanship of Panchen Erdeni, the Acting Chairman, the Preparatory Committee successfully held its first plenary session of committee members exercising the functions of the Tibetan local government. It made five resolutions on implementing the State Council’s order of March 28, and improving and strengthening the institutions of various departments of the Preparatory Committee, which were warmly supported by the people of Tibet. The Tibetan committee members and cadres of the Preparatory Committee were even more delighted and motivated. They said excitedly: In the past, whenever we encountered the evil eyes of those traitorous elements in our building, we felt like a stone was stuck in our hearts. Today, the situation of the Preparatory Committee is different. We feel relaxed, no one is obstructing our work, and the Tibetan people’s right to national regional autonomy will no longer be undermined.
    This year, April 22, is the third anniversary of the founding of the Preparatory Committee.
    On the eve of this day, we visited the Preparatory Committee. Stepping into the large office on the second floor, we saw people coming and going, and the telephones on the desks ringing constantly, with everyone very busy. In front of a large table on the south side, a young cadre wearing a dark Tibetan robe was intently working on a steel plate, stenciling an official document. The wax paper was densely filled with neat lines of Tibetan characters. This was a notice from the General Office of the Preparatory Committee, requiring all departments to quickly formulate a staffing plan for the new institutions and a work plan for this year.
    In the conference room next to the office, most of the committee members and cadres of the Preparatory Committee were holding a discussion on Premier Zhou's government work report at the National People's Congress. Secretary-General Apé Awang Jinmei had gone to Beijing to attend the National People's Congress, and the discussion was chaired by Deputy Secretary-General Laming Yexi Chuchen. He was happily chatting with the newly appointed Tibetan member of the State Council, Gadeng Chiba, the successor of the Yellow Sect founder Tsongkhapa, who sat next to him. The old man, draped in a cassock, nodded and smiled at the Deputy Secretary-General from time to time. At this discussion, nine people spoke, unanimously expressing their agreement with and support for Premier Zhou's government work report on the Tibetan issue.
    During the break, Chen Jingbo, the only Han Chinese Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, and Laming Yexi Chuchen walked out together to discuss the issue of organizing celebrations for the third anniversary of the Preparatory Committee. Laming said that he had consulted Deputy Director Pabala Zhuolie Langjie, who was recovering in the hospital, about this issue the day before. Deputy Director Pabala said that the celebrations must be grand and warm, and decided to write a celebratory article himself. Then Laming outlined the arrangements he had made.
    Laming Yexi Chuchen and Chen Jingbo have been working together for several years, respecting each other, consulting each other, and establishing a close friendship.
    We came to the Culture and Education Department, where several responsible cadres were also holding a meeting. They were excitedly discussing the opening date of the newly established Lhasa Third Primary School. Before the suppression of the rebellion, there were only two primary schools in Lhasa, and many children were afraid to go to school due to the obstruction and sabotage of reactionary elements. After the rebellion was suppressed, the number of parents requesting their children to enroll increased two or three times. The original two primary schools could not accommodate them, so the Preparatory Committee decided to immediately open a third primary school. This new primary school was decided to be established in the northern suburbs of Lhasa.
    The film projection team of the Culture and Education Department is drafting a plan to show movies to the citizens in rotation. In the past, when this projection team showed movies to the citizens at night, the rebels often gathered crowds to throw stones at the projector and even shot at the projection staff. Now, in the Lhasa urban area where order has been restored, no one will interfere with people's cultural life anymore.
    Just as we were about to leave the Preparatory Committee, Jiangjin Wangqiujiebu hurriedly walked in. He was originally the Deputy Chief of the Secretariat Section of the General Office and has now been promoted to Deputy Director of the General Office. There are a total of four Directors and Deputy Directors in the General Office, all of whom are Tibetans. The other three directors are all out on official business, and he is responsible for handling all the affairs of the General Office.
    As soon as Jiangjin Wangqiujiebu stepped in, a female secretary asked him to answer the phone. The call was from a work team of the Lhasa Military Control Commission, reporting that a woman who was wandering the streets and whose life was in danger due to illness had been sent to the hospital. They were searching for the old woman’s family and preparing to provide relief as appropriate. Jiangjin Wangqiujiebu expressed his agreement on the phone.
    Jiangjin Wangqiujiebu is a lively and energetic young man. During the Lhasa rebellion, the rebels specifically ordered that he be killed. He said: "The rebels are not targeting me personally, but mainly want to undermine the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, prevent the Tibetan people from realizing national regional autonomy, and continue to maintain their dark and reactionary rule."
    When we asked him what his thoughts were on the third anniversary of the founding of the Preparatory Committee, he pondered for a while and then said: "There are too many things to think about. But I just want to say one thing: The Chinese Communist Party's policy of national regional autonomy has brought happiness to our Tibetan people. From the first day the Preparatory Committee was established, I have been working here. In the past three years, I have deeply felt that the Central People's Government has not only given the Tibetan people the right to autonomy but also taken many positive measures to promote the realization of national regional autonomy. What is hateful is that those reactionary elements have undermined it in many ways, preventing many things that the Preparatory Committee should have done and could have done from being accomplished."
    Leaving the office building of the Preparatory Committee, it was already evening. The golden roof of the building was bathed in the sunset, and the willow trees of Xuesecheng Linka rustled softly in the breeze. We sincerely congratulate the Tibetan people on starting a new life of national regional autonomy.

    西藏民族区域自治的时代开始了
    宗子度　郭超人
    在拉萨雪策林卡里，耸立着一幢金顶飞檐，具有西藏建筑风格的高大楼房，这是西藏自治区筹备委员会的办公大楼。一百十几万西藏人民用关切和信任的心情注视着它，一小撮反动分子却把它看作眼中钉。
    拉萨叛乱前两年多来，在这座大楼里，也经常可以看到索康·旺清格勒、柳霞·土登塔巴、先喀·居美多杰（夏苏）、噶章·洛桑日增、帕拉·土登为登等人，他们坐在委员席上，也参加开会办公，表面上高谈阔论，堆着满脸奸笑，背地却满腹鬼胎，想各种诡计进行破坏。因此长期以来，在自治区筹委会前进的道路上，暗礁四伏，举步艰难，全盘机构陷于瘫痪状态。在今年3月叛乱事件中，也就是这些人，索康、柳霞、夏苏、噶章、帕拉……聚集叛乱武装包围罗布林卡，劫持达赖喇嘛，同时更加大肆嚣张地破坏筹委会。尽管他们也看到筹委会中90％以上的成员是藏族人，但仍然诋毁筹委会是“甲雄”（汉人的机关），威胁参加筹委会工作的藏族人员退出机关，“悔过自新”，否则就加以杀害。然而曾几何时，仇视西藏人民实行民族区域自治的叛国分子们已走上了灭亡的道路，自治区筹委会变得比任何时候更加壮大和团结了。
    4月8日，筹委会在代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼主持下，圆满地举行了它行使西藏地方政府职权的第一次全体委员会议，作出了关于贯彻执行国务院3月28日命令，以及健全和加强筹委会各部门机构等五项决议，受到全西藏人民的热烈拥护。筹委会的藏族委员和干部更是欢欣鼓舞，干劲冲天。他们兴奋地说：过去在我们的大楼里，一碰到那些叛国分子的邪恶眼光，心里就像塞上了一块石头。今天，筹委会的情况不同了，我们心情舒畅了，工作没有人阻挠了，西藏人民的民族区域自治权利再也不会受到破坏了。
    今年4月22日，是筹委会成立三周年日子。
    在这个日子到来的前夕，我们访问了筹委会。走进二楼的大办公室，看到这里人来人往，案头电话铃声不断，一切都很忙碌。南边大台桌前，一个身穿深色藏袍的青年干部，正聚精会神地伏在钢板上刻写公文。腊纸上密排着一行行整齐的藏文，这是筹委会办公厅的一份通知，通知要求所属各部门迅速拟订新机构的编制方案和今年度工作规划。
    在办公室隔壁的会议室里，筹委会的大部分委员和干部正在开会座谈周总理在人代大会上所作的政府工作报告。秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美去北京参加人代大会了，座谈会由副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣主持。他正和坐在他旁边的国务院新任命的藏族委员、黄教祖师宗喀巴的继承人噶登赤巴在愉快的交谈。这位身披袈裟的老人不时地向副秘书长点头微笑。在这次座谈会上，有九个人发了言，他们对于周总理政府工作报告中所谈到的西藏问题一致表示赞同和拥护。
    休息时，筹委会唯一的一位汉族副秘书长陈竞波和拉敏·益喜楚臣一道走出来，共同商讨筹办筹委会成立三周年庆祝活动问题。拉敏说，前天他就这个问题向正在医院养病的帕巴拉·卓列朗杰副主任委员请示过，帕巴拉副主任委员说，庆祝活动一定要隆重热烈，并决定自己写一篇庆祝文章。接着拉敏概述了他所作的安排。
    拉敏·益喜楚臣和陈竞波在一起工作好几年了，他们互相尊重，协商办事，建立了亲密的友谊。
    我们来到文教处，这里的几位负责干部也在开会。他们正兴奋地讨论新开办的拉萨第三小学的开学日期。叛乱平息前，拉萨只有两所小学，由于反动分子的阻挠破坏，许多孩子们不敢去上学。叛乱平息后，家长们要求孩子入学的一下增加了两三倍。原来两所小学容纳不下，所以筹委会决定立即新开办第三所小学。这所新小学决定设立在拉萨北郊。
    文教处的电影放映队，正在拟制轮流给市民放映电影的计划。过去，这个放映队在夜间为市民放映电影时，叛乱分子常纠众用石块打放映机，甚至开枪射击放映人员。现在，在秩序已经恢复的拉萨市区，再没有谁来干扰人们的文化生活了。
    我们刚要离开筹委会，江金·旺秋杰布匆匆走了进来。他原是办公厅秘书科副科长，现在被提升为办公厅副主任。办公厅一共四位正副主任，全是藏族，其他三位主任都因公外出，办公厅的一切事务都由他处理。
    江金·旺秋杰布一跨进门，一位女秘书就请他去听电话。电话是拉萨军管会的一个工作队打来的，他们报告说，一位流浪街头、因病生命垂危的妇女已被送进了医院，他们正在寻访老妇人的家属，准备酌情救济。江金·旺秋杰布在电话里表示同意。
    江金·旺秋杰布是个生气勃勃的青年人。拉萨叛乱期间，叛匪指名要打死他。他说：“叛匪倒不是对付我个人，主要是想搞垮自治区筹委会，不让西藏人民实现民族区域自治，继续维持他们黑暗反动的统治。”
    当我们问他，在筹委会成立三周年的时候有什么感想？他沉思了一会，然后说：“想到的东西太多了。但我只想说一点：中国共产党的民族区域自治政策给我们西藏人民带来了幸福。从筹委会成立第一天起，我就在这里工作，三年来，我深深感到中央人民政府不仅给了藏族人民自治权利，还采取了许多积极的措施来促进民族区域自治的实现。可恨的是那些反动分子们多方破坏，使筹委会许多应该办也能够办的事都没有办成。”
    从筹委会的办公大楼出来，已经傍晚了。大楼的金顶沐浴在霞光里，雪策林卡的柳林在微风中发出轻柔的声响。我们衷心祝贺西藏人民开始了民族区域自治的新生活。
