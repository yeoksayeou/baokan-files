This reporter Jin Yukun reports from Kunming on the 12th: The Fuyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, relying on the masses, has summarized the experience of arranging food crop varieties in agricultural production over the years. It determines the planting area of ​​various crops according to local conditions in river valleys, dam areas, semi-mountainous areas, mountainous areas, and alpine mountainous areas, to further develop the characteristics of different regions and ensure increased grain production this year.
    The county's natural conditions are relatively complex, and the climate, soil, water conservancy, and other conditions vary greatly between regions. This spring, when the First Secretary of the County Party Committee went to Housuo Commune in the mountainous area to inspect work and discussed with farmers how to arrange the planting area of ​​various crops, he found that the commune planned to plant 5,000 mu of rice according to the original plan. In fact, only 3,000 mu had irrigation, and planting rice could definitely increase production; the remaining 2,000 mu were unsuitable for planting rice, and it was estimated that only 200 to 300 jin could be harvested, which was half the yield of planting corn. This incident inspired the county party committee to seriously mobilize the masses to summarize the experience of adapting to local conditions over the years. In the summary, many valuable experiences and lessons were discovered. For example, it is a good thing to change dry land into paddy fields, just as the farmers say, "Three droughts are not as good as one water," but in mountainous and alpine mountainous areas, the situation is just the opposite. Due to the low temperature and cold water, the rice yield is often lower than that of corn. For example, in the Luna Management Area of ​​Shuijing Commune, at an altitude of more than 2,500 meters, the average temperature is 12 to 14 degrees Celsius, and the average corn yield can reach more than 400 jin, but rice will not mature if planted; another example is that in some areas of the river valley, the corn yield is higher than that of potatoes, but in the alpine mountainous areas, the potato yield is higher than that of corn; there are also some alpine mountainous areas where the yield of potatoes and corn is low, and some are not easy to mature, but buckwheat can be harvested at 200 to 300 jin per mu. Therefore, crops should be planted based on specific conditions. After summarizing and researching, the county party committee initially made a planting plan for the main crops in river valleys, dam areas, semi-mountainous areas, mountainous areas, and alpine mountainous areas, and also made arrangements for flue-cured tobacco and other cash crops.
    After the county party committee put forward this plan, it mobilized the masses to discuss: Is it better to plant rice or corn on the 800 mu of land in Yantou, Gangchang Commune? The masses presented many facts, stating that in 1956, this land was planted with corn and suffered frequent waterlogging, with only more than 300 jin per mu; however, after changing to rice last year, it received more than 700 jin. In this way, everyone decided to plant rice. More than 70 mu of sloping land in Dongshan Commune has high terrain, low temperature, and barren soil. The corn grown in previous years was always "dwarf officials," but one year the yield of potatoes reached more than 2,000 jin per mu, so everyone decided to plant potatoes. As a result of arranging crop varieties through mass discussion, everyone is more confident in achieving the production increase plan, and the spring plowing and sowing in the county immediately formed a climax. The attendance rate of various communes has generally increased, work efficiency has improved, and the season has been advanced. The fertilizer that has been accumulated in the county accounts for 84% of the fertilizer used for the major spring crops. After discussion by the masses, the county party committee concentrated the opinions of the masses and further revised the planting plan. In this way, this year's production increase plan is based on a more reliable foundation.

　　富源县委发动群众讨论什么地方种什么好
　　因地制宜种植庄稼
　　本报昆明12日电　记者金雨困报道：中共云南富源县委依靠群众总结了历年农业生产中安排粮食作物品种的经验，分别河谷、坝区、半
  山区、山区、高寒山区因地制宜确定各种作物的种植面积，进一步发挥不同地区的特长，确保今年粮食增产。
    这个县的自然条件比较复杂，各个地区间的气候、土质、水利等条件极不相同。今春县委第一书记到山区后所公社去检查工作，和农民一道座谈怎样安排各种作物种植面积时，发现这个社按照原定计划要种植水稻五千亩，实际上只有三千亩解决了灌溉问题，种水稻肯定可以增产；其余二千亩因条件不适宜，种水稻估计仅能收二、三百斤，比种包谷产量要低一半。这件事情启发了县委认真地去发动群众总结历年因地制宜的经验。在总结中发现了许多非常宝贵的经验和教训。如把旱地改为水田本是好事，正如农民们所说“三旱不如一水”，但在山区和高寒山区情况恰恰又相反，因受气温低、水冷的限制，水稻产量往往低于包谷。如水井公社鲁纳管理区，在海拔二千五百公尺以上，平均温度是十二度到十四度，包谷产量平均可达四百斤以上，但种水稻就不会成熟；又如在河谷的一些地区种包谷产量比洋芋高，但在高寒山区种洋芋又比包谷产量高；也有部分高寒山区种洋芋、包谷产量都低，有的还不易成熟，但种荞麦每亩可收二、三百斤。因此，应当从具体情况出发，针对具体条件来种植作物。县委经过总结研究以后，初步作出了全县河谷、坝区、半山区、山区、高寒山区主要作物的种植品种计划，对烤烟等经济作物也作了安排。
    县委提出这个规划后，又发动群众讨论：钢厂公社岩头八百亩地，究竟种水稻好还是种包谷好？群众摆出许多事实，说明1956年这块地种包谷因常遭涝害，每亩只收三百多斤；但去年改种水稻后收到七百多斤。这样，大家就决定种水稻。东山公社七十多亩下坡地，地势高、气温低、土瘦，往年种出的包谷总是“矮老官”，但有一年种洋芋亩产量却达二千斤以上，大家就决定种洋芋。通过群众讨论安排作物品种的结果，大家对实现增产计划信心更足，全县的备耕春播立即形成高潮。各公社普遍出勤增加、工效提高、季节提早，全县已积的肥料占大春用肥量的84％。经过群众讨论以后，县委集中群众意见，进一步修订了种植计划。这样，就使今年的增产计划建立在更可靠的基础上了。
