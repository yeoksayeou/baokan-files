    Let Envelopes Also Contribute to Propaganda Work
    Recently, I saw a friend receive a letter from Shenyang, with two slogans printed on the back of the envelope: one was "Realize the General Line" and the other was "Yankee Imperialists Get Out!", I couldn't help but applaud.
    I think the back of envelopes can not only be printed with songs, but also with good short poems, cartoons, and maxims. In this way, each envelope becomes a very good propaganda item.

    让信封也为宣传工作出力
    最近，我看到一位朋友接到一封从沈阳寄来的信，信封的背面印着两个歌子：一是“实现总路线”，一是“美英帝国主义滚出去”，不禁拍手称好。
    我觉得，信封背面不仅可以印上歌曲，而且可以选印一些好的短诗、漫画以及格言等。这样，每个信封又成了很好的宣传品了。
