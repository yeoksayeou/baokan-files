    Nantong Museum
    Years of restoration have made it a sight to see,
    Cultural relics and potted plants are arranged in every way.
    This achievement could only be accomplished today,
    The new garden is even better than the old one.
  　The museum's collection and gardens were completely lost and destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War. After liberation, the buildings were repaired. The displayed cultural relics and potted plants are all donations from various sources. The flowers and trees are thriving, and no one would have imagined that it was a wasteland ten years ago.

    南通博物馆
    数年恢复已堪观，
    文物盆栽罗百般。
    此绩亦惟今可致，
    新园更胜旧时园。
  　这个馆的收藏和园林，抗战期间全部散失和破坏。解放以后修复屋宇。陈列的各种文物和盆栽，都是各方捐赠的。花木欣欣向荣，谁也想不到十年前是个废园。
