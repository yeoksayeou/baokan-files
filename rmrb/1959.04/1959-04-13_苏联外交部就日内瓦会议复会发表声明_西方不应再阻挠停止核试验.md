Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 12th regarding the resumption of the Geneva Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests, scheduled for the 13th. The statement said that the Soviet government believes that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference should do everything possible to reach an agreement as soon as possible on the outstanding issues in concluding an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests.
	The statement pointed out that the Soviet government believes that if the United States and Britain could demonstrate the same desire to reach an agreement as the Soviet Union, then the Geneva Conference could immediately find a way to resolve the issues before the conference in a way that is in line with the interests of peace.
	In the statement, the Soviet Foreign Ministry listed facts to refute the rumors and propaganda spread by certain people in the United States, who insisted that the difficulties in the work of the Geneva Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests were caused by the position taken by the Soviet Union. The statement emphasized that it was precisely because of the Soviet Union's initiative and efforts that the conference was previously able to reach agreement on seven articles of the agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests. However, the process of the Geneva Conference showed that the United States and Britain were not only not eager to reach an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, but, on the contrary, took various steps to obstruct the work of the conference and obstruct the conclusion of an agreement.
	The statement pointed out that the United States and Britain attempted to revise the recommendations drafted by the Geneva Experts Conference last summer, groundlessly demanded to guarantee their dominant position in the Supervisory Committee, and put forward various other demands, which were absolutely not based on the task of effectively supervising the cessation of atomic and nuclear weapon tests, but were intended to increase the difficulties of the Geneva Conference and ultimately bring the conference to a standstill.
	In the statement, the Soviet government once again proposed that a voting procedure must be sought for the Supervisory Committee that would preclude the possibility of using this institution to serve the interests of one side and ensure equal status for all parties.
	The statement emphasized that the Soviet Union is not seeking a privileged position in the supervisory organization, as the United States propaganda machine claims, but is trying to establish a procedure that can equally guarantee the interests of all parties.
	The statement said that analyzing the proposals made by the United States and Britain on the supervisory organization leads to the conclusion that the Western countries are not interested in establishing international supervision, but in obtaining reconnaissance materials about the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union does not need this supervision, which is essentially reconnaissance, because the Soviet Union has no intention of aggression and never intends to attack anyone.
	The statement pointed out that the Western countries at the Geneva Conference are currently, in effect, still in the same position they were in when they first participated in the conference. The Soviet government expressed the hope that the progress made by the Geneva Conference in reaching agreement on a series of important articles will enable the conference to reach agreement on the articles on which no consensus has yet been reached after its resumption on April 13. In this way, the way can be cleared for the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, which the people of all countries eagerly await.

### 苏联外交部就日内瓦会议复会发表声明  西方不应再阻挠停止核试验

　　苏联外交部就日内瓦会议复会发表声明
　　西方不应再阻挠停止核试验
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部12日就定于13日复会的日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议发表了声明。声明说，苏联政府认为参加日内瓦会议的国家应该竭尽全力来使在缔结停止核武器试验协定方面尚未解决的问题尽快地达成协议。
    声明指出，苏联政府相信，如果美英两国能够像苏联那样，也表现出想达成协议的意愿，那么，日内瓦会议就能够立即找到符合和平利益的、解决摆在会议面前的问题的办法。
    苏联外交部在声明中列举事实，驳斥了美国某些人士的造谣宣传，他们硬说什么日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议的工作之所以发生困难，似乎是由于苏联所采取的立场而引起的。声明强调指出，正是由于苏联的倡议和努力，会议在这以前才能就关于停止核武器试验协定的七项条款达成协议。然而，日内瓦会议的过程表明，美英两国不仅不急于达成关于停止核武器试验的协定，而且，相反地采取了各种步骤来阻挠会议的工作和阻挠缔结协定。
    声明指出，美英两国企图修改去年夏天日内瓦专家会议所拟定的建议，毫无根据地要求保证自己在监督委员会中的统治地位，并且提出其他种种要求，而这些要求绝对不是从对停止原子武器和核武器试验进行有效监督的任务出发的，而是为了要增加日内瓦会议工作的困难，并且使会议最后陷于僵局。
    苏联政府在声明中再一次提出，必须为监督委员会寻求出这样一种表决程序，这种表决程序要能排除利用这个机构来为某方面的利益服务的可能性，并要能保证各方面享有平等地位。
    声明强调指出，苏联并不像美国宣传机构所说的那样在为自己谋求在监督机构中的特权地位，而是努力想确立一种可以同等地保证各方面利益的程序。
    声明说，把美国和英国就监督机构提出的建议加以分析，便可以得出这样的结论：西方国家感兴趣的不是建立国际监督，而是获得有关苏联的侦察材料。苏联不需要这种实质上是要进行侦察活动的监督，因为苏联没有侵略的意图，它从来不打算进攻任何人。
    声明指出，西方国家在日内瓦会议上目前实际上仍然停留在它们当初参加会议时的那种立场上。苏联政府表示希望，日内瓦会议在这以前在一系列重要条款达成协议方面所取得的进展，将使得会议有可能在4月13日复会以后就还没有取得一致意见的条款取得协议。这样，就可以为缔结各国人民殷切瞩望的、停止试验核武器协定扫清道路。
