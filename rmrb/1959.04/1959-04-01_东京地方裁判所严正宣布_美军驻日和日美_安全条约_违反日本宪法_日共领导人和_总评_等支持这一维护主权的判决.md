Xinhua News Agency, March 31st Dispatch from Tokyo: The Tokyo District Court yesterday declared that the U.S. military presence in Japan and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" violate the Japanese Constitution, and acquitted seven workers and students who opposed the expansion of the U.S. military base in Tachikawa. This action has received enthusiastic support from the Japanese public.

    Shiga Yoshio, a member of the Central Committee Presidium of the Japanese Communist Party, stated in an article published in "Akahata" (Red Flag) today that Kishida Nobusuke once stated in the Diet that the U.S. military stationed in Japan is "not restricted by the Constitution." However, shortly after this statement, the Tokyo District Court issued this ruling, which is of great significance.

    Shiga also stated that the people of the entire nation should unite more closely to uphold the Constitution and further develop the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement."

    Miyamoto Kenji, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, stated yesterday that this ruling is of great significance in the history of Japanese jurisprudence. He highly praised the courage of the judge for making a ruling based on the obligation to protect the Constitution.

    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) issued a statement yesterday stating that this ruling shows that the war policy adopted by the Kishida Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party violates the Constitution, and that our struggle to defend peace, independence, and democracy is just.

    Yasui Iku, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, told reporters today that this is a major ruling with historical significance. The council will strengthen its activities to extricate Japan from the U.S. atomic strategy system.

    The Japan Socialist Party sent a representative today to meet with Chief Cabinet Secretary Akagi Munenori, demanding that the Kishida Nobusuke government immediately stop the negotiations to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" based on the Tokyo District Court's ruling.

    This ruling by the Tokyo Court has caused unease among U.S. authorities. Kyodo News Agency reported from Washington that a Japanese affairs expert "closely related to the (U.S.) State Department" expressed concern that the ruling would cause the negotiations to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to "effectively come to a standstill." The U.S. side also threatened Japan through so-called "legal experts familiar with Far Eastern issues," saying that "if the Japanese Supreme Court supports this acquittal, the U.S. government may hold the Japanese government accountable for failing to fulfill its treaty obligations. If this issue develops into the worst-case scenario, the U.S. government may sue in the International Court of Justice."

    The Kishida Nobusuke government decided at a cabinet meeting today not to change its interpretation of the Constitution, nor to stop the negotiations to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and would explain this to the U.S. side. Kishida Nobusuke announced at a plenary session of the House of Representatives today that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement" are "valid," and that his government would not change its policy of holding negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty." Kishida Nobusuke revealed that his government will appeal to the High Court. Japanese newspapers revealed that the Kishida Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party, fearing that this ruling would have an adverse impact on them in local elections and the House of Councillors elections, are attempting to get the Supreme Court to overturn the Tokyo Court's ruling.

    东京地方裁判所严正宣布
    美军驻日和日美“安全条约”违反日本宪法
    日共领导人和“总评”等支持这一维护主权的判决
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：东京地方裁判所昨天宣布美军驻在日本和日美“安全条约”违反日本宪法，并判决反对扩大美军立川基地的七名工人和学生无罪的行动，得到了日本公众的热烈支持。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员志贺义雄今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话指出，岸信介曾经在国会里发表谈话说，驻日美军“不受宪法的限制”，但是在这以后不久，东京地方裁判所就作出了这个判决，这个意义是非常大的。
    志贺还说，全国人民应该更加团结，来维护宪法，并且为废除日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”而进一步展开斗争。
    日本共产党总书记宫本显治昨天发表谈话说，这个判决在日本裁判史上有着重要意义。他对法官根据保卫宪法的义务作出判决的勇气给以很高的评价。
    日本工会总评议会昨天发表声明说，这个判决表明，岸信介政府和自由民主党采取的战争政策是违反宪法的，我们保卫和平、独立和民主的斗争是正当的。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁今天向新闻记者发表谈话说，这是一次带有历史意义的重大判决。协议会今后将加强活动，为使日本脱离美国的原子战略体系而奋斗。
    日本社会党今天派代表会见了内阁官房长官赤城宗德，要求岸信介政府根据东京地方裁判所的判决，立刻停止修改日美“安全条约”的谈判。
    东京裁判所的这一判决已经引起了美国当局的不安。共同社发自华盛顿的消息说：“同（美国）国务院有密切关系”的日本问题专家表示担心这个判决会使修改日美“安全条约”的谈判“在事实上陷于中断”。美国方面还通过所谓“通晓远东问题的法律家”向日本威胁说：“假如日本最高裁判所支持这个无罪的判决，美国政府恐怕会追究日本政府不履行条约义务的责任。假如这个问题发展到最坏的情况的话，美国政府可能会向国际法院起诉。”
    岸信介政府今天在内阁会议上决定不改变它对宪法的解释，也不停止修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，并且要向美国方面进行说明。岸信介今天在众议院全体会议上宣布，日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”是“有效的”，他的政府不改变要举行修改“安全条约”的谈判的政策。岸信介透露，他的政府将向高等法院上诉。日本报纸透露，岸信介政府和自由民主党由于担心这个判决会在地方选举和参议员选举中对它们产生不利影响，正企图使最高裁判所否定东京裁判所的判决。
