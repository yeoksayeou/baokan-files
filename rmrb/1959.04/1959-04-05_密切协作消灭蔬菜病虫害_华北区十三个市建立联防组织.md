Closely Collaborate to Eliminate Vegetable Pests and Diseases
Thirteen Cities in North China Establish Joint Prevention Organization

(Our dispatch) The joint prevention zone of thirteen cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding to eliminate vegetable pests and diseases recently held its first meeting in Beijing to discuss the organization of a joint prevention agency and to approve the 1959 joint prevention plan for the elimination of vegetable pests and diseases.

The meeting decided that thirteen cities in the joint prevention zone, including Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Jinan, Qingdao, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Datong, Xi'an, and Baoji, should closely cooperate and jointly make great leaps forward in eliminating vegetable pests and diseases, in order to ensure a greater bumper harvest of vegetables.

The joint prevention plan stipulates the main targets and basic requirements for the prevention and control of vegetable pests and diseases in 1959: eliminate downy mildew, powdery mildew, aphids, and red spiders that harm cucurbit vegetables, ensuring that leaves do not dry, curl, or yellow; eliminate damping-off, eggplant blight, tomato leaf mold, and red spiders and cotton bollworms that harm solanaceous vegetables, ensuring no dead seedlings, no rotten fruits, no wormholes in fruits, and no disease spots or white spots on leaves; focusing on Chinese cabbage and radishes in autumn vegetables, eliminate vegetable aphids, cabbage caterpillars, flea beetles, and beet armyworms, ensuring that vegetable leaves are not bitten by insects and do not wither. It also requires focusing on the effective prevention and control methods for Chinese cabbage downy mildew, soft rot, and mosaic virus. In addition, each city can formulate other pest and disease prevention and control measures according to local conditions to carry out comprehensive prevention and control.

The plan also determined this year's specific work plan and stipulates that cities within the joint prevention zone regularly exchange information and experiences on the prevention and control of vegetable pests and diseases; forecasting and prediction organizations should communicate information at any time, so that each city can jointly grasp the trends of pest and disease occurrence and development, and prepare early to carry out prevention and control work in a timely manner.
