The Inevitable Road to Being Both Red and Expert
Representative Liu Chengzhao Reports on the Gains of Sichuan Medical College's Teachers and Students Going to the Countryside and Mountains

Mr. Chairman, esteemed delegates:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I will strive to realize the magnificent leap forward plan for 1959.

In order to resolutely implement the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, Sichuan Medical College, on the basis of vigorously developing work-study programs, running factories and farms, smelting iron and steel, and participating in epidemic prevention work last year, organized 1,156 students from the medical, health, dental, and pharmaceutical departments (third and fourth years) and 116 teachers and doctors in December of last year to go to 35 counties in the five special districts (autonomous prefectures) of Liangshan, Xichang, Ya'an, Leshan, and Mianyang to carry out pest elimination and disease control work, and to move some teaching and scientific research work to the field. After three months of practical work, the gains have been great. They have not only contributed to ensuring the health of the masses but have also undergone relatively profound changes in their thinking, gradually establishing the view that medical and health work must serve the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and socialist construction. At the same time, they have also explored some experiences in implementing the principle of combining theory with practice in teaching and further improving teaching.

This group of teachers and students who went to the countryside and mountains, under the leadership of the local party and government, actively carried out pest elimination and disease control work and achieved certain results. After arriving in various places, the teachers and students immediately launched a campaign to eliminate the "seven pests" and promote hygiene, and worked with the masses to carry out pest elimination and disease control. Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, which had poor sanitary conditions due to historical conditions, basically changed its past sanitary outlook in a short period of three months with the joint efforts of the masses and the teachers and students. From December last year to the end of February this year, a total of more than 480,000 rats and more than 490,000 sparrows were eliminated, as well as a large number of mosquitoes and flies. A large number of sewage ditches were cleared, and a large number of polluted mud pits were filled. More than 80 million catties of fertilizer were accumulated, and more than 31,000 toilets were built, separating humans from livestock, and changing the phenomenon of "no toilets for people and no pens for livestock" that had existed in Liangshan Autonomous Prefecture for thousands of years. From cities to villages, households generally cleaned up many times. People who never washed their faces or changed their clothes began to wash their faces, wash clothes, brush their teeth, and take baths, changing old habits that had existed for thousands of years and establishing a new atmosphere of hygiene. At the same time, health surveys were conducted, with 553,464 people surveyed, accounting for 92.24 percent of the total population of the eight counties in the state, basically clarifying the distribution of common diseases in Liangshan, proposing prevention and treatment plans, and carrying out partial prevention and treatment work for key diseases. In order to consolidate the results, many areas also universally mobilized the masses to establish personal and collective hygiene covenants and hygiene systems on a voluntary basis and further helped the masses in various places establish medical and health care networks. For example, the teachers and students working in the Xichang area trained more than 2,300 health workers, health aides, and midwives for the local area by means of lectures and apprenticeships, and established 121 health centers and clinics. In Liangshan, a total of 4,521 "three-member teams" were trained, laying the foundation for the development of health care work in the future. While eliminating pests and diseases, they also actively conducted folk custom and talent-gathering work. According to incomplete statistics, the teachers and students in various places collected more than 30,000 folk remedies, tested prescriptions, and secret formulas, 177 handwritten copies of various traditional Chinese medicine books, and nearly 5,000 pieces of collected drug specimens. Undoubtedly, this is of positive significance for implementing the policy of traditional Chinese medicine and promoting the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, in on-site teaching, although the areas were dispersed and there was a shortage of teachers, on-site teaching was conducted based on the specific situation and the principle of teaching what was available. For example, encephalitis was prevalent in Hongya and Meishan counties, and teachers explained to students the causes, symptoms, treatment, and prevention of encephalitis, and demonstrated and practiced physical signs, combining textbook knowledge with practice, with good results.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's education policy, more than 1,000 teachers and students of our college who went to the countryside and mountains have achieved a bumper harvest in both ideology and knowledge in a short period of three months, which is specifically manifested in the following aspects:

1. They eliminated squeamishness and cultivated a tenacious will and the spirit to overcome difficulties. Most of the areas where the teachers and students went were mountainous areas with sparse populations and relatively harsh environments. This was a relatively severe test for teachers and students who had lived in cities for a long time, but the vast majority of teachers and students passed this test and became stronger in the face of difficulties. For example, some teachers and students in Ningnan, Xichang, got up early every day after arriving from the county to the district, took the initiative to clean the courtyard, carry water, chop firewood, wash rice, and cook, which was praised by local cadres and the masses. When they first arrived, many people could not walk on mountain roads, and their feet swelled after walking for a day, and they were tired and unable to work after walking four or five miles. But later, not only could the men walk long distances, but also the female students could carry luggage and climb mountains. Although the clinical course for third-year students had not yet started, and there were many problems in medical treatment due to the lack of equipment, many difficulties were overcome due to diligent study and hard work in the work. For example, when students treated the masses, they used large-headed pins and sewing needles to first pierce themselves when they did not have silver needles, and then gave them to the patients after success, and achieved good results. When treating a patient with severe soft tissue laceration of the lower extremities, sewing needles were used as surgical instruments for suturing due to the lack of equipment, and good results were also achieved. Some used small bamboo tubes to replace tracheal intubation to perform tracheotomy on a baby with laryngeal obstruction and saved the patient's life.

2. They strengthened the relationship with workers and peasants, cultivated the feelings of the working class, and promoted the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism. Teachers and students went deep into the countryside and lived, ate, and worked with the masses. On the one hand, they learned the noble qualities of diligence, simplicity, and bravery from the peasants, and further realized the necessity of intellectuals participating in labor and ideological remolding. On the other hand, they also deeply understood the pain of the masses suffering from diseases and their urgent need for medical workers, which further stimulated their revolutionary humanitarian spirit and cultivated the feelings of the working class. A student in Yanyuan County, in order to rescue a sick child, took off his coat at night and wrapped it around the child, and braved the harsh cold wind to walk more than 20 miles to the county for emergency treatment, and the child's mother was deeply grateful. Some students in Shaping District encountered a sick child suffering from measles. The doctor in the commune hospital thought that he could not be saved. After everyone's active rescue and all-night care, the sick child was finally rescued from danger. These examples deeply moved the masses, who said: "These are really good students trained by Chairman Mao."

3. They implemented the principle of combining theory with practice and cultivated the ability to work independently. When third-year medical students first arrived in the countryside, many people could not distinguish between stage one and stage two trachoma when they opened their eyelids. Through mutual discussion and asking for advice from traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and teachers, they learned to examine the body, ask about illnesses, physically diagnose six diseases, identify the main symptoms and treatments of common diseases, and acupuncture. Some students said: "In the past, when the teacher talked about pertussis, I turned over the various symptoms in the book, but I could never distinguish them clearly. This time a child came to see a doctor and coughed once. A classmate pointed out that this was a typical symptom of pertussis. I will never forget this disease again, and I remember it better than anything else." Not only that, through health surveys and disease treatment, teachers and students widely came into contact with various diseases and gained a lot of perceptual knowledge, laying a good foundation for future theoretical study; teachers also increased their knowledge through practice. The teachers and students in Emei found that many miners suffered from colds, but they did not know the reason. Later, they participated in labor with the miners and deeply understood from the labor that the huge difference in air inside and outside the mine was the main cause of the disease. The teachers explained this problem to the students and made rationalization proposals to the factory leaders, changing the above-mentioned phenomenon. Although the third-year students in Xichang had studied the basics of internal medicine, they did not know how to contact patients, understand complete medical histories, and conduct comprehensive physical examinations. Although the fourth-year medical students had studied parasitology, infectious diseases, and environmental hygiene, they did not know how to perform routine stool examinations and identify various parasite eggs, let alone give vaccinations or smallpox vaccinations. Through this practical work of going to the countryside and mountains to eliminate pests and diseases, adhering to the principle of combining theory with practice, and adopting the method of working, learning, and applying at the same time, all students have basically mastered the knowledge of eliminating pests and diseases and promoting hygiene. At the same time, they have practical experience in common general diseases and epidemics, and have learned some skills in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention measures. Through collecting folk customs and interviewing talented people, and vigorously collecting medicinal wild plants, they not only exercised and cultivated the students' ability to collect medicines and identify medicinal wild plants, but also consolidated and improved their knowledge of pharmacognosy, enriching and enriching the content of pharmacognosy. In addition, in this pest elimination and disease control work, due to the requirements of the work and the pressure of the situation, most of the students worked independently, which prompted them to study seriously and strive to improve their ideological level and professional ability. For example, three fourth-year medical students in Jiage County had never seen a doctor before, but they saw more than 10,000 patients in just two months.

4. They further clarified the correctness of the policy that education must serve proletarian politics and education must be combined with productive labor. Before going to the countryside and mountains, teachers and students only understood some of the principles of this policy, but they did not have a deep understanding. Through practice, they personally saw that the Yi compatriots had long been ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries and the slave system, and there were no medical and health conditions at all. After liberation, especially after the democratic revolution, the slave owners were defeated and the slave system was overthrown, and they urgently needed medical and health knowledge. They welcomed the teachers and students who went to the countryside and mountains and thought that it was the care of the Party and Chairman Mao for them. This greatly educated the teachers and students, and they realized that doing a good job in the health work of minority areas also meant implementing the Party's ethnic policy, which was of great political significance. At the same time, in the work of eliminating pests and diseases, they came into contact with the working people and saw that the working people could not participate in labor and production due to the torment of diseases, especially when infectious diseases were prevalent, which directly affected industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, they deeply understood that medical education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor in order to train health cadres who serve socialist construction.

The above gains are a major victory for our college in the education revolution. Although this kind of on-site teaching is a relatively new problem for us, and some problems remain to be further studied and improved, I firmly believe that as long as we resolutely continue to implement the Party's education policy and constantly sum up experience and improve teaching methods, we will definitely be able to achieve greater victories in our future work and train medical and health workers who are both red and expert for the country.

    又红又专的必由之路
    刘承钊代表报告四川医学院师生上山下乡的收获主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告并为实现一九五九年宏伟的跃进计划而奋斗。
    四川医学院为了坚决贯彻教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，在去年大力开展勤工俭学，大办工厂农场，大炼钢铁以及参加防疫工作等取得胜利的基础上，于去年十二月组织了医疗、卫生、口腔三、四年级及药学系三年级部分学生一千一百五十六人，教师医生一百一十六人到凉山、西昌、雅安、乐山、绵阳五个专区（自治州）的三十五个县展开了除害灭病工作，并把部分教学与科学研究工作搬到现场进行。经过三个月实际工作的锻炼，收获很大。他们不仅对保障群众身体健康作出了贡献，而且在思想上起了比较深刻的变化，逐渐地树立起医药卫生工作必须为工农业生产大跃进服务，为社会主义建设服务的观点。同时在贯彻理论联系实际的教学原则和进一步改进教学方面，也摸索到了一些经验。
    这批上山下乡的教师和学生，在当地党政领导下，积极开展除害灭病工作，取得了一定的成绩。师生到达各地后，立即展开了除七害、讲卫生的宣传活动，并和群众一起大搞除害灭病工作。曾受历史条件影响、卫生条件较差的凉山彝族自治州，在广大群众和师生的共同努力下，经过短短三个月的时间，就基本上改变了过去的卫生面貌。从去年十二月到今年二月底共消灭老鼠四十八万多只，麻雀四十九万多只，以及大批蚊蝇，清理了大批污水沟，填平了大量的污坭坑，积肥达八千多万斤，修建厕所三万一千多个，使人畜分居，改变了凉山自治州千百年来“人无厕所牲畜无圈”的现象。全州从城市到乡村家家户户一般都多次打扫清洁，从来不洗脸不换衣的人开始洗脸洗衣，刷牙洗澡，改变了千百年的旧习惯，树立起讲卫生的新风气。与此同时，并进行健康普查，普查了五十五万三千四百六十四人，占该州八个县总人口的百分之九十二点二四，基本上摸清了凉山常见疾病的分布情况，提出了防治方案，并对重点疾病进行了部分防治工作。为了巩固成绩，不少地区还普遍发动群众，在自觉自愿的基础上，订立了个人和集体卫生公约与卫生制度，并进一步帮助各地群众建立了医疗保健网。如在西昌地区工作的师生，采取讲课和带徒弟的办法为当地训练了卫生员、保健员、接生员二千三百多人，建立了保健院所一百二十一个；在凉山培训了“三员”共达四千五百二十一人，为今后发展保健工作扎下了根基。在除害灭病的同时，还积极进行了采风访贤工作，据不完全统计，各地师生收集到的民间单方、验方和秘方达三万多个，各种中医中药手抄本一百七十七本，采集的药物标本近五千件。无疑，这对贯彻中医政策，发扬祖国医学遗产等方面都有积极意义。此外，在现场教学上，虽然由于地区分散，师资不足，但都根据具体情况和有什么教什么的原则，进行了现场教学。如洪雅、眉山县流行脑炎，教师就给学生讲解了脑炎的发病原因、症状和处理预防，并作了体症的示教和实习，使书本知识和实践结合起来，效果很好。
    在党的教育方针的光辉照耀下，我院一千多名上山下乡的师生，经过短短三个月的时间，无论在思想上或知识上都获得了丰收，具体表现在以下几方面：
    1．打掉了娇气，培养了顽强的意志和勇于克服困难的精神。这批师生所到地区多是山区，地广人稀，环境比较艰苦。这对于长期生活在城市的师生说来，是一个比较严重的考验，但绝大多数师生都经受了这个考验，在困难中把自己锻炼得更加坚强。如在西昌宁南的部分师生，由县到区后，每天起得很早，主动打扫庭院，担水劈柴，淘米做菜，受到了当地干部和群众的好评。刚去时，不少人走不来山路，走一天就走肿了足，走四、五里路就疲倦不能工作，但到后来不仅男的能走长途，而且女同学也能背着行李，翻山越岭了。三年级学生的临床课虽未入门，加上器械缺乏，在医疗上存在不少问题，但由于在工作中勤学苦钻，边学边作，许多困难都被克服了。如学生们为群众治病时，没有银针就用大头针和缝衣针先在自己身上试扎，成功后，再给病人扎，同样取得良好疗效。在治一个下肢严重软组织撕裂的病人时，器械不足，就用缝衣针作外科手术器械进行缝合，也取得良好效果。有的在抢救一个患喉头阻塞病的娃娃时，用小竹筒代替气管插管作了气管切开术，救活了病人。
    2．密切了和工农群众的关系，培养了工农阶级感情，发扬了革命人道主义精神。师生深入农村和广大群众同吃、同住、同劳动，一方面向农民学习了勤劳、朴实、勇敢的高贵品质，进一步认识到知识分子进行思想改造参加劳动锻炼的必要性；另一方面也深切了解到群众遭受疾病折磨的痛苦和他们对医务工作者的迫切需要，这就更加激发了他们的革命人道主义精神，培养了工农阶级感情。盐源县一个同学，为了抢救一个病孩，在夜里脱了自己的大衣裹住小孩，冒着凛冽的寒风，走二十多里山路送往县上进行急救，病孩的母亲深为感激。有些学生在沙坪区遇到一个患麻疹的病孩，公社医院的医生认为无法救了，经过大家积极抢救，通夜护理，终于将病孩从危险中抢救过来。这些事例，都深深感动了群众，他们说：“这真是毛主席培养出来的好学生。”
    3．贯彻了理论联系实际的原则，培养了独立工作能力。医学三年级学生初到农村时，不少人翻开眼皮分不清砂眼是一期还是二期的。通过互相讨论，请教中医和教师，学会了查体问病，物理诊断六病，识别常见疾病的主要症状和治疗方法以及针灸等。有的学生说：“过去老师讲百日咳，我翻了书本上的各种症状，总是分辨不清。这次小孩来看病，咳了一声，一个同学指点我说，这是典型的百日咳症状，我就再不会忘记这种病症，比什么都记得清楚。”不仅如此，师生通过健康普查和治疗疾病，广泛地接触了各种病症，得到了不少感性知识，为今后理论学习打下很好的基础；教师们通过实践，也增长了知识。在峨眉的师生发觉了很多矿工患感冒，但不知原因，后来他们同矿工一起参加劳动，从劳动中深入了解到矿井内外的空气悬殊太大是造成疾病的主要根源，教师把这问题对学生作了讲解，并向该厂领导上提出合理化建议，改变了上述那种现象。到西昌的三年级学生虽然读过内科的基础，但还不知如何接触病人，了解完整的病史和进行全面的体格检查；医学四年级学生虽读了寄生虫病传染病学和环境卫生学，但不知作大便常规检查和识别各种寄生虫卵，更从未作过预防注射、种牛痘。通过这次上山下乡除害灭病的实际工作，坚持理论联系实际的原则，采取边工作、边学习、边应用的办法，全体学生已基本上掌握了除害灭病讲卫生的知识，同时，对于常见的一般疾病和流行病都有了实际的体会，对于诊断治疗和预防措施都学到了一些本领。通过采风访贤，大力收集药用野生植物，不仅锻炼和培养了同学们的采药和识别药用野生植物的能力，同时还巩固和提高了生药学的知识，充实和丰富了生药学的内容。此外，在这次除害灭病工作中，由于工作的要求和形势所迫，学生们大多独当一面的工作，这就促进他们必须进行认真学习，努力提高自己思想水平和业务能力。如呷咯县有三个医疗系四年级的学生原来没有看过病，但在这次仅仅两个月的时间里就看病一万多人次。
    4．进一步明确了教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，教育必须与生产劳动相结合的方针的正确性。在未下乡上山之前，教师和学生对这个方针仅仅懂得一些道理，但体会不深。通过实践，他们亲眼看到了彝族同胞过去长期受着国民党反动派和奴隶制度的统治，根本没有医药卫生条件；解放后，特别是经过民主革命，打垮了奴隶主，推翻了奴隶制度，他们迫切需要医药卫生知识，对上山下乡的师生很欢迎，认为是党和毛主席对他们的关怀。这使师生受到很大的教育，认识到搞好少数民族地区的卫生工作，也就是贯彻了党的民族政策，政治意义是很大的。同时在除害灭病的工作中，接触了劳动人民，看到劳动人民由于疾病的折磨，不能参加劳动生产，特别是传染病流行时直接影响工农业生产，因而深深地懂得了医学教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须与生产劳动相结合，才可能培养出为社会主义建设服务的卫生干部。
    以上这些收获，是我院在教育革命中的一个重大胜利。虽然这种现场教学对我们来说是比较新的问题，有些问题尚待进一步研究和改进，但我深信，只要今后坚决继续贯彻党的教育方针，并不断总结经验，改进教学方法，我们一定能够在今后工作中取得更大的胜利，为国家培养出又红又专的医药卫生工作人员。
