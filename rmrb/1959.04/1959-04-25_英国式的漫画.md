    British-Style Cartoons
    Migǔ
    In recent days, many so-called "cartoons" reflecting the Tibet issue have appeared in some Indian newspapers. You might mistakenly think they are the "masterpieces" of the British at first glance. Their style, brushstrokes, layout, and even the format of the signature are British-style. However, the content, which reverses black and white, slanders China, and opposes peaceful coexistence, is no less than that of some Western reactionary cartoons, almost birds of a feather. But, on second thought, it is not surprising, because the authors of these cartoons originally did not have their own skills and ambitions. They merely inherited the mantle left by their former masters completely, from form to thought.
    To be a cartoonist, the most important thing is to have one's own mind, to avoid being like a groundhog, unable to see the situation clearly, unable to hear the voices of the real people, and relying solely on the breath of declining politicians. What I say may not be appropriate for these painters, because in their lives they only know US dollars, pounds, and rupees.
    Drawing cartoons also requires reason and logic. This is indeed a difficult problem for those who stand on the position of expansionism, and if they are not careful, they will reveal their true colors and make fools of themselves. Let us give an example: On March 30, the Indian "Mail" had a work like this: the author distorted China's Premier into a ferocious hunter, who shot and killed a yak representing "Tibet"; next to him, an Indian said to him: "Nehru felt uneasy after hearing a gunshot." We will not talk about whether it is appropriate to vilify the Premier of a friendly country, nor will we talk about the principle that quelling the Tibetan rebels is to save millions of Tibetan people from fire and water. We just want to ask the author: The Tibetan rebels opened fire on us three years ago, and not just once. Why did you feel so "at ease" at that time? Why did he suddenly feel "uneasy" when the People's Liberation Army was ordered to quell the rebellion and when all Chinese people were celebrating? We Chinese cartoonists have not yet taken up our pens to counterattack the shameful conspiracy of Indian expansionists to interfere in China's internal affairs. To be honest, it is not that we cannot see through their tricks, nor that we have any good feelings for them, but because we are rational and mindful of the overall situation. We know that the weapon of cartoons is sharp. We hope that Indian expansionists can be more sober-minded and have some self-control. Then, considering the friendship between China and India, it is not impossible for us to temporarily not use this weapon. I wonder if these words are "playing the lute to a cow" again?

    英国式的漫画
    米谷
    连日来在印度一些报纸上出现了不少反映西藏问题的所谓“漫画”，冷不防你会把它们误认为英国人的“杰作”，其风格、用笔、布局、甚至签名的格式都是英国式的，而内容之颠倒黑白、诬蔑中国、反对和平共处并不下于一些西方反动漫画，几乎是一丘之貉。但是，细想想也觉得并不奇怪，因为这些漫画的作者原并没有什么自己的本领与志气，他们不过是从形式到思想完全继承了他们以前的主子留下来的衣钵罢了。
    要想做一个漫画家，最忌没有自己的头脑，像土拨鼠般地看不清局势，听不到真正人民的呼声，一味仰仗没落政客的鼻息。我这样讲，也许对这些画家是不合适的，因为在他们一生中原只知美元、英镑和卢比而已。
    画漫画，也要讲道理、讲逻辑。这对站在扩张主义立场的人的确是难题，弄得不好就会露马脚、出洋相。让我们举一个例吧：3月30日印度“邮报”上有这样一幅作品：作者把中国的总理歪曲成一个凶暴的猎手，打死了一头代表着“西藏”的牦牛；旁边一个印度人在对他说：“尼赫鲁听到一声枪响深感不安。”我们先不谈丑化友邦总理是否应该，也不谈平定西藏叛匪就是挽救百万西藏人民出水火的道理。我们只要问一下这位作者：西藏叛乱分子三年前就已向我们开了枪，并且不止一枪，你们那时候为什么倒感到很“安”呢？为什么当解放军奉命平乱的时候，全中国人都在额手相庆的时候，他却突然感到“不安”起来了呢？对于印度扩张主义者企图干涉中国内政的可耻阴谋，我们中国漫画家至今尚未提笔反击。说实话，不是我们看不透他们的鬼计，更不是我们对他们有什么好感，而是因为我们是有理性的，顾全大局的。我们知道漫画这一武器是锐利的，我们希望印度扩张主义分子头脑能够清醒些，有些自制。那么，我们顾念中印两大国的友谊，暂时不用这一武器，也未尝不可。不知我这些话是否又在“对牛弹琴”了？
