The two sides emphasized the consistency of their foreign policies. Severely condemned the United States for interfering in South Vietnam, undermining the Geneva Accords, and its aggressive policies in Asia. The two parties believe it is necessary to resolutely struggle against modern revisionism. The two sides signed an agreement in which the Hungarian government granted Vietnam a long-term loan of 10 million rubles.
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 26th: A joint communiqué was issued here tonight by the delegations of the Vietnam Democratic Republic's Lao Dong Party and government and the Hungarian People's Republic's Socialist Workers' Party and government.

The communiqué was signed by the head of the Vietnamese delegation, Pham Van Dong, member of the Political Bureau of the Lao Dong Party Central Committee and Prime Minister of the Vietnamese government, and the head of the Hungarian delegation, Munnich Ferenc, member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee and Prime Minister of the Hungarian government.

The communiqué said that the party and government delegations of the two countries exchanged views on major current international issues and various issues related to the two countries, as well as issues of strengthening friendly cooperation between the two countries. "The talks were conducted in a cordial atmosphere. The two sides reached a complete consensus on all the issues discussed."

Regarding the current international situation, the communiqué emphasized the consistency of the two countries' foreign policies. The communiqué said: "The Soviet Union's unremitting struggle to defend world peace and security is increasingly gaining the sympathy and support of the people of all countries. The government of the Vietnam Democratic Republic and the government of the Hungarian People's Republic fully support the Soviet Union's peace initiatives and are determined to fight by all means to achieve these initiatives."

The communiqué emphasized that the revival of German fascist militarism and revanchism under the support of the United States seriously threatens peace in Europe and the world. The communiqué condemned the revival of fascism in West Germany and the provocative policies of the Bonn government, and expressed firm support for the Soviet government's proposals on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and other suggestions.

The communiqué severely condemned the aggressive and interventionist policies of the United States in Southeast Asia and the Far East, and pointed out that this policy threatens the peace and tranquility of the people in this region.

The communiqué said that since the cessation of the Indochina War, the United States government has been trying to create tension in this region. The communiqué said: The United States' placing of South Vietnam within the so-called "protection zone" of the Southeast Asia Treaty aggressive bloc is a blatant violation of the 1954 Geneva Accords.

The communiqué condemned the US imperialism's increasingly deep interference in the internal affairs of Laos, its conspiracy to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty military aggressive bloc, its instigation of Laotian reactionaries to abandon the Geneva Accords on the Laotian issue, and its creation of tension in the region.

The communiqué emphasized that the unification of Vietnam must be achieved by peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, and believes that the Geneva Accords have been grossly violated by US imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities.

The communiqué said: "The two sides severely condemn US imperialism for interfering in South Vietnam, undermining peace, suppressing and persecuting South Vietnamese patriots and former resistance fighters. The recent poisoning of more than 1,000 Vietnamese patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp in South Vietnam is one of the most barbaric consequences of US imperialism's interference in South Vietnam. The two sides strongly condemn this shocking crime to world public opinion and demand that US imperialism leave South Vietnam."

The communiqué said: "The two sides warmly congratulate the growing anti-colonialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The two sides declare their firm support for this struggle and will forever be friends of all nations that are striving for and consolidating their independence."

The communiqué said: "The two sides condemn the following acts of US imperialism that seriously threaten peace in the Far East: militarily supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, constantly provoking the People's Republic of China, and maintaining the artificial division of Korea at all costs."

The communiqué emphasized: "US imperialism must get out of Taiwan and South Korea!"

The communiqué emphasized the great contribution of the 1957 Moscow Declaration to the international revolutionary movement and the important international significance of the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

The communiqué said: "The two sides emphasize that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with its rich and important experience, its theoretical level, and its consistent Marxist-Leninist policies, has become the leader of the large family of communist and workers' parties of all countries."

The communiqué said: "The delegations of the two fraternal parties believe that they have the task of resolutely fighting against the main crisis that is threatening the international workers' movement - modern revisionism. Faced with the conspiracy of modern revisionism to distort revolutionary theory, the two parties, together with the communist and workers' parties of all countries in the world, vigilantly maintain the purity of Marxism-Leninism."

In discussing the relations between Vietnam and Hungary, the communiqué said that the two sides' delegations noted with great satisfaction that the political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries have developed. The communiqué said:
    "In the process of studying the issues of economic cooperation between the two countries, the two sides' delegations exchanged views on the measures that the Hungarian People's Republic could take to help the Vietnam Democratic Republic promote industrial growth. The two sides' delegations signed an agreement, according to which the Hungarian People's Republic government granted the Vietnam Democratic Republic a long-term loan of 10 million rubles (payable in goods) to purchase the entire machinery and equipment of an electrical equipment factory. The two sides' delegations also exchanged views on ways for experts from the two countries to exchange experiences, and on providing scholarships for Vietnamese students studying abroad, etc."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 26th: 70,000 Hanoi citizens held a grand rally in Ba Dinh Square today to welcome the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government delegation headed by Prime Minister Munnich Ferenc.
