    "Early," "Dense," and Cultivating Strong Seedlings, Deep Plowing, and Applying Sufficient Base Fertilizer are Inseparable.
    All Measures to Increase Production Form a Unified Whole.
    A Reporter's Commentary on the Early Rice Production Increase Measures of Xiaoyou Management District, Chengjiang Commune
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 8th. Reporter Jin Sha's Commentary: Early sowing, cultivating strong seedlings, rational close planting, appropriate deep plowing, and applying sufficient base fertilizer are an inseparable whole and must be closely integrated. Neglecting any one of these will prevent the achievement of high early rice yields. The Xiaoyou Management District of Chengjiang Commune in Huangyan, Zhejiang, paid attention to combining these aspects, making production increase measures more effective, and greatly increasing the enthusiasm of the masses for striving for large-scale high yields.
    Early sowing and early transplanting can increase early rice yield, as has long been proven in Xiaoyou Management District. Last year, the Chengjiang Production Team had two fields with identical conditions. One field was sown and transplanted five days earlier, yielding 750 jin per mu; the other field was sown five days later, yielding only 640 jin. The same land, the same variety, the same fertilizer, and the same management, only the sowing time was different, and the yield differed by more than 100 jin! Other production teams had similar situations. Therefore, this year, all production teams in this management district generally paid attention to early sowing. Last year, transplanting generally started six days after Qingming Festival; this year, it started six days before Qingming Festival. To achieve this, the management district adopted various methods. For example, a small portion of the large fields used direct seeding; green manure fields used the method of plowing and transplanting simultaneously. By doing so, the first batch of seedlings was transplanted around April 7th.
    Experience has also proven that early transplanting must be based on cultivating strong seedlings, appropriate deep plowing, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and rational close planting.
    "Good seedlings are half the harvest," as every farmer knows. To have good seedlings, two tasks must be done well: (1) Select superior varieties with large ears, many grains, full grains, fertilizer tolerance, and high yield. Last year's experience showed that early rice yielding over 2,000 jin per mu used high-yielding varieties such as Nantete. This year, Xiaoyou Management District first paid attention to selecting superior varieties. This year, the Meili Production Team in this management district used superior varieties such as Nantete No. 16, Xiongjiao, and Atomic No. 2 for 70% of its rice seeds; 30% were relatively good early japonica varieties. Inferior seeds were no longer used. Not only were superior varieties selected, but before sowing, they were all subjected to sun drying, winnowing, screening, and disinfection. After these superior varieties were sown, they germinated quickly and emerged uniformly. (2) Cultivate strong seedlings carefully. This year, Xiaoyou Management District adopted semi-dry seedling beds to cultivate seedlings. Commune members call this type of semi-dry seedling bed a high-yield seedling bed because it is simple and convenient to manage, and the seedlings grow vigorously. They paid attention to selecting experienced commune members to be responsible for cultivation and established a seedling bed management responsibility system. The commune members responsible for managing the seedling beds took care of the seedlings as if they were their own children. After Hua Bingman of the Meili Production Team took on the task of managing the seedling beds, he not only frequently went to the seedling beds during the day to check the growth of the seedlings, but also got up twice at night. Because he was so responsible, when a very small number of seedling leaves developed yellow spots, Hua Bingman was able to discover them quickly and treat them. One night, Hua Bingman woke up and felt a little cold, so he immediately mobilized four commune members to cover the seedling beds with straw mats to prevent frost. Because of this, the seedlings Hua Bingman was responsible for cultivating were all very strong.
    There is a significant difference in yield between dense planting and not dense planting, rational dense planting and irrational dense planting. Last year, Xiaoyou Management District conducted such an experiment: in one mu of land, two fen were planted densely at 2×5 inches, and two fen were planted densely at 3×5 inches. As a result, the former yielded 191 jin, and the latter yielded 150 jin. This means that the yield per mu of 2×5 inch dense planting was 955 jin, while the yield per mu of 3×5 inch dense planting was 750 jin. Of course, the degree of dense planting should be determined according to local conditions. It is correct that Xiaoyou Management District adopted several different dense planting specifications based on land and other conditions.
    To plant densely, it is necessary to plow deeply accordingly. A commune member from the Wuxing Production Team in Xiaoyou Management District made a good analogy regarding the relationship between dense planting and deep plowing. He said: deep plowing is like the foundation of a house, and dense planting is like a tall building. Without a good foundation, a tall building cannot be built; even if it is built, it will collapse. Indeed, it is so. Last year's facts proved that after deep plowing, the early rice's resistance to lodging was enhanced, the rate of empty grains was reduced, and the yield increased by more than 30% compared to shallow plowing. Having accepted this experience, Xiaoyou Management District carried out appropriate deep plowing this year. According to statistics as of April 1, of the 700 mu of large fields that had been plowed, about 500 mu were plowed to a depth of six to eight inches. Last year, the depth of plowing was mostly around four inches.
    To be early and dense, it is also necessary to apply sufficient base fertilizer accordingly. One of the fundamental experiences of early rice production increase last year was to apply sufficient base fertilizer and good topdressing. The ratio of base fertilizer to topdressing was 8:2. This is because early rice needs more fertilizer in the early stages for rooting, tillering, and leaf growth, and this period also prepares nutrients for the later stages of jointing, stalk growth, and ear formation. Insufficient base fertilizer and excessive topdressing often lead to early lodging. This year's spring flowering crops provided such experience: those with sufficient base fertilizer and good topdressing grew thick stalks and large ears, without lodging; conversely, those with thin stalks and small ears experienced severe lodging. This year, each production team in Xiaoyou Management District generally increased fertilizer application by more than 30% compared to last year. The various fertilizers applied totaled 60 to 70 dan of standard fertilizer. A few production teams applied even more fertilizer to the fields. Compared to last year, the Meili Production Team increased fertilizer application by about one time. Therefore, the Meili Production Team and the Wuxing Production Team are still continuing to dredge river mud. They plan to apply an additional 30 dan of river mud per mu.
    Because the leading cadres and commune members clearly understand the interrelationship of various production increase measures, this management district tightly grasped the work of dense planting, deep plowing, etc. while "seizing time and catching up with the season." The leadership found that the dense planting of individual teams did not meet the specifications, and that the transplanting speed of individual teams was not fast enough even though they paid attention to the dense planting specifications. Therefore, on April 3, they immediately convened an on-site meeting, demanding that each production team learn from the two advanced production teams with the best dense planting and the fastest sowing speed. The branch secretaries, production team leaders, and operation group leaders who attended the meeting all said that they must catch up with these two production teams.
    The reporter also saw some areas where, although great attention was paid to "early" and "dense," the work of seedling cultivation, deep plowing, and manure accumulation was done relatively poorly. In this way, early transplanted and densely planted early rice will not be able to stand firmly, and high yields will not be reliably guaranteed. To ensure high yields of early rice, we should do as the Xiaoyou Management District did, and closely integrate the various production increase measures.

    “早”“密”和培育壮秧、深耕、施足基肥不可分离
    各项增产措施是一个整体
    本报记者述评澄江公社孝友管理区的早稻增产措施
    本报杭州8日电　记者金沙述评：提早播种、培育壮秧、合理密植、适当深耕、施足基肥，这些增产措施是一个不可分离的整体，必须密切结合。忽略其中任何一项，都不能达到早稻丰产目的。浙江黄岩澄江公社孝友管理区在这几个方面注意了相互结合，增产措施就显得更加有力，大家争取大面积丰产的热情也分外高涨。
    早播早插可以增加早稻产量，这在孝友管理区早已证实。澄江生产队去年有两块条件相同的田，其中一块田早播早插五天，每亩产量是七百五十斤；另有一块田迟种五天，产量就只有六百四十斤。同样的土地，同样的品种，同样的肥料，同样的管理，只因为播种时间不同，产量就相差一百多斤！在其他生产队也有这样的情况。因此，这个管理区的各个生产队今年普遍注意了提早播种。去年一般在清明后六天开始插秧，今年在清明前六天就开始插秧。为了做到这一点，这个管理区采用了各种方法。例如：少部分大田采用直播的方法；绿肥田采用边耕边插的方法。这样做，4月7日左右就插完第一批秧。
    经验也证实了：提早插秧必须以培育壮秧、适当深耕、施足基肥和合理密植为基础。
    “秧好一半稻”，这是每个农民都知道的。要秧好，就要做好两项工作：（一）选用穗大、粒多、粒饱、耐肥、高产的优良品种。去年的经验证明，亩产二千斤以上的早稻，都是选用了南特号等高产良种。孝友管理区今年首先注意选用良种。这个管理区的美丽生产队今年有70％的谷种是良种南特十六号、熊交、原子二号；30％是比较好的早粳。不好的种子，已经不再采用。不仅选用良种，而且在播种之前，还都经过了晒种、风选、筛选和消毒等工作。这些良种播下以后，发芽快，出苗齐。（二）精心培育壮秧。孝友管理区今年采用了半旱秧田培育秧苗。社员把这种半旱秧田叫做丰产秧田，因为这种秧田管理简单方便，秧苗生长茁壮。他们注意挑选有经验的社员负责培育，并建立了秧田管理责任制。负责管理秧田的社员，就像照顾自己儿女一样照顾秧苗。美丽生产队的华炳满担负管理秧田的任务以后，不但白天经常到秧田检查秧苗生长情形，就是夜里也要起来两次。正因为这样负责，当有极少数秧苗叶子发生黄斑时，华炳满就能很快发现，加以医治。有一次夜里，华炳满醒来觉着身上有点冷，就立刻动员四个社员一起去给秧田盖上席子，防止了霜冻。正因为如此，华炳满负责培育的秧苗都非常茁壮。
    密植与不密植，合理密植与不合理密植，产量显著不同。孝友管理区去年曾作了这样的试验：在一亩田中，有二分是2×5寸密植，有二分是3×5寸密植。结果，前者的产量是一百九十一斤，后者的产量是一百五十斤。这也就是说：2×5寸密植的亩产量是九百五十五斤，而采用3×5寸密植的亩产量是七百五十斤。当然，密植程度要根据当地的条件来决定。孝友管理区根据土地等条件，分别采用了几种不同的密植规格，这样做是正确的。
    要密植，就必须相应地深耕。对于密植和深耕的关系，孝友管理区的五星生产队的一个社员作了一个很好的比喻。他说：深耕就好像房基，密植就好像高楼，没有好的房基，高楼就修不起来；即使修起来了，也会倒塌。的确如此。去年的事实证明：深耕以后，早稻抗倒伏力增强，秕谷率降低，比浅耕的可以增加产量30％以上。孝友管理区正是接受了这个经验，今年进行了适当的深耕。根据到4月1日的统计，已耕的七百亩大田中，深耕六寸到八寸的约有五百多亩。而去年耕地的深度大部分是四寸左右。
    要早，要密，还必须相应地施足基肥。去年早稻增产根本经验之一是基肥施得足，追肥施得好。基肥与追肥的比例是8∶2。因为早稻前期扎根、分蘖、长叶需要较多的肥料，这一时期还要为后期拔节、长秆、孕穗准备养料。基肥不足，追肥过多，往往会造成早期倒伏。今年的春花作物就提供了这样的经验：基肥足、追肥好的就长得秆粗穗大，没有倒伏；反之，就秆细穗小，倒伏现象比较严重。孝友管理区各生产队今年比去年普遍增施肥料30％以上。所施的各种肥料折合标准肥达六十担到七十担。少数生产队施到田里的肥料更多。美丽生产队同去年比较，增加一倍左右。因此，美丽生产队、五星生产队，现在还在继续捞河泥。他们计划每亩田还增施三十担河泥。
    正因为领导干部和社员群众都明确地认识各项增产措施的相互关系，所以这个管理区在“抢时间、赶季节”的时候，紧紧地抓住密植、深耕等工作。领导上发现有个别队的密植不大符合规格，有个别队虽然注意了密植规格，但是插秧速度不够快，就立即在4月3日召开了现场会议，要各个生产队学习密植最好的和播种速度最快的两个先进生产队。参加会议的分支书记、生产队长和操作组长，都表示一定要赶上这两个生产队。
    记者也看到一些地区，虽然对于“早”和“密”十分注意，但育秧、深耕、积肥等工作却做得比较差。这样，早插、密植的早稻就会站不稳脚跟，丰产也就没有可靠的保证。要确保早稻丰产，就应该像孝友管理区这样做，把各项增产措施密切结合起来。
