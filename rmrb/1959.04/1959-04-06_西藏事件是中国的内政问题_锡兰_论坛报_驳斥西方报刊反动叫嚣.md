Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, April 3rd: The Ceylon "Tribune" published an editorial on the 3rd stating that the Tibetan issue is China's internal affair.

The newspaper said, "Within the People's Republic of China, Tibetans are a minority nationality. There is no doubt that, as far as minority nationalities are concerned, China implements an enlightened and progressive policy."

After explaining the series of propaganda by the West against China on the Tibetan issue, the newspaper said, "The people of India and Ceylon can easily understand how foreign reactionaries are trying to assist local reactionaries in carrying out treasonous activities."

The latest issue of the Ceylon bi-weekly "Forward" refuted the nonsense of some Ceylon newspapers attempting to portray the Tibetan issue as a struggle by Buddhist monks for their nation and their religion. It pointed out that the fact that these rebels "were so quickly supported by Chiang Kai-shek and President Eisenhower shows which way the wind is blowing."

    西藏事件是中国的内政问题
    锡兰“论坛报”驳斥西方报刊反动叫嚣
    新华社科伦坡3日电　锡兰“论坛报”3日发表社论说，西藏事件是中国的内政问题。
    这家报纸说，“在中华人民共和国内，西藏人是少数民族。没有疑问，就少数民族而言，中国执行一种开明的和进步的政策。”
    这家报纸在说明了西方就西藏事件对中国进行的一系列的宣传以后说，“印度和锡兰的人们能够容易地了解，外国反动派如何力图援助地方上的反动派进行叛国活动。”
    锡兰“前进”双周刊最近一期驳斥了锡兰某些报纸企图把西藏事件描绘成为佛教僧侣为他们的民族和他们的宗教而进行斗争的胡说。它指出，这些叛乱者“那样迅速地受到了蒋介石和艾森豪威尔总统的支持一事就表明了风向是什么”。（附图片）
