　　Fell, haul, clear, and replant simultaneously
　　Ensure forest regeneration keeps up with felling
    Last year's regeneration speed saw unprecedented improvement; this year, continue to leap forward.
    Xinhua News Agency, 15th. This year, all provinces have been grasping forest regeneration work early and tightly, implementing plans and specific measures, and attaching importance to seedling cultivation. Heilongjiang Province successively held on-site meetings in Dailing and Meixi to study this year's regeneration work, and promoted the Yichun area's experience of "long-term integration (integrating regeneration into regular felling), short-term blitz (vigorously blitzing during the most favorable regeneration season), two major mobilizations (mobilizing the entire Party and all employees), and three major assaults (regeneration seedling cultivation, clearing forest farms, and seed collection)." The province will launch a ten-thousand-person corps assault week or assault month during the spring regeneration season. Sichuan Province aims to basically achieve simultaneous felling, hauling, clearing, and regeneration this year. Strengthen seedling cultivation work, adopt measures such as deep plowing and fertilization to promote early seedling emergence and ensure regeneration needs. In mid-March, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region issued instructions on further strengthening forest regeneration work, requiring all localities to resolutely implement the policy of simultaneous felling and regeneration while vigorously producing timber. Jilin Province put forward the fighting slogan of "Break through the regeneration barrier and strive for regeneration to catch up with felling this year," requiring the completion of 70% of the regeneration tasks in the spring.
    Under the fighting slogan of "Cut trees with one hand and plant trees with the other," forest regeneration work across the country is leaping forward. According to materials from sixteen provinces (regions) alone, a total of 372,900 hectares of regeneration was completed in the past year, basically approaching the forest felling area of ​​the same year. In the five provinces and regions of Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu and Sichuan, the forest regeneration area of ​​twelve forestry bureaus has caught up with or exceeded the felling area. The quality of regeneration work has also improved compared with previous years. The survival rate of artificial seedling planting and regeneration is generally above 80%. Many regions have also launched a technical reform movement centered on reforming tools. The Yichun Daixiu Factory and the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory have created China's first powered weeding machines and digging machines of various types, laying a good foundation for the continued leap forward in regeneration work.
    However, the current forest regeneration in our country still cannot meet the needs of the high-speed development of national construction. In particular, in some key felling areas, the regeneration area has not kept up with the felling area. For example, in Heilongjiang Province last year, the regeneration area only accounted for 63.5% of the felling area of ​​the same year, and the survival rate of regenerated seedlings was not high in some areas.
    In order to expand the forest area, the Ministry of Forestry held a forest regeneration symposium in the five provinces and regions of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Xinjiang in March, summarizing the experience of the great leap forward in forest regeneration in 1958, and planned the specific tasks for forest regeneration in 1959.

　　随采伐　随集材　随清林　随更新
　　确保森林更新赶上采伐
    去年更新速度空前提高，今年要继续跃进
    新华社15日讯　今年，各省对森林更新工作都抓的早，抓的紧，计划落实，措施具体，并重视了种苗的培育工作。黑龙江省先后在带岭、美溪两地召开现场会议，研究今年的更新工作，并推广伊春地区“长结合（在常年采伐中结合更新）、短突击（在更新最有利季节大力突击）、两大动员（全党动员、全体职工动员）、三大突击（更新育苗、清理林场、采种）”的经验。全省要在春季更新季节开展一个十万人大兵团的突击旬或突击月。四川省今年要基本上做到随采伐、随集材、随清林、随更新。加强育苗工作，采取深翻、施肥等措施，促使苗木提早出圃，保证更新需要。内蒙古自治区在3月中旬发出关于进一步加强森林更新工作的指示，要求各地在大力生产木材的同时，坚决贯彻执行采伐与更新并举的方针。吉林省提出“冲破更新关，力争今年更新赶上采伐”的战斗口号，要求春季完成70％的更新任务。
    在“一手砍树，一手栽树”的战斗口号下，全国各地的森林更新工作在大步跃进。仅据十六个省（区）的材料，过去一年中共完成更新面积三十七万二千九百多公顷，基本上接近了当年的森林采伐面积。内蒙古、吉林、黑龙江、甘肃和四川五省区已有十二个林业局的森林更新面积赶上或超过了采伐面积。更新工作的质量也较往年有所提高。人工植苗更新成活率一般在80％以上。许多地区还开展了以改革工具为中心的技术改革运动。伊春大修厂和哈尔滨林业机械厂创制出我国第一台各式动力除草机和挖坑机，为更新工作的继续大跃进打下了良好的基础。
    但是，目前我国森林更新事业还不能适应国家建设高速度发展的需要。特别是一些重点采伐地区，更新面积还赶不上采伐面积。如黑龙江省去年更新面积只占当年采伐面积的63.5％，更新的树苗成活率在一些地区还不高。
    为了扩大森林面积，林业部在3月召开的黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古、甘肃、新疆五省区森林更新座谈会上，总结了1958年森林更新工作大跃进的经验，规划了1959年森林更新的具体任务。
