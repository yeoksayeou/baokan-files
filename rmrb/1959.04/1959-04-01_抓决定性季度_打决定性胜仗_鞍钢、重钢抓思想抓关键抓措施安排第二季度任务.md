(People's Daily, Anshan, March 31st) The Chinese Communist Party's Anshan Iron and Steel Company Committee convened a meeting of factory directors and Party secretaries on the 28th to summarize first-quarter production and arrange second-quarter tasks.

The meeting believed that the second quarter is a crucial season for Anshan Iron and Steel's production to leap forward, and the tasks for the second quarter are greater than those of the first quarter. Major measures for completing the annual plan are almost all concentrated in the second quarter. Completing the various tasks in the second quarter will lay the foundation for a greater leap forward in the second half of the year. To ensure the overfulfillment of production in the second quarter, the meeting required Party organizations in all factories and mines to first grasp ideological work. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to summarize the work of the first quarter, explain the current situation, and encourage all employees to exert greater effort and work diligently and cleverly; the main responsible cadres of the Party committees, general branches, and branches should immediately go deep among the masses to mobilize them and push the production upsurge to a higher stage. Second, grasp the key points. Launch an in-depth technical revolution movement around solving the key problems and weak links in current production and construction. Factories, mines, workshops, work sections, teams, and even individuals are required to make plans for technical revolution and technical innovation, and concentrate efforts in each period to overcome one or two technical difficulties. Party organizations and trade unions at all levels should strengthen leadership and conduct regular evaluations. Each factory and mine should evaluate once a month, each workshop and work section once every ten days or every week, and the company decided to conduct a major evaluation and comparison every quarter. Third, grasp the measures. There are 120 measures to be implemented in the second quarter, including 32 capital construction projects and 86 technical measures. These major measures require unified arrangement, clear responsibilities, and ensure completion on schedule and with quality. The progress of each major measure should be checked once a day. The company and the company Party committee decided to check the implementation of the measures once a week.

In addition, the meeting also required Party organizations in all factories and mines to strengthen enterprise management inspection and consolidate existing rules and regulations, and continue to care for the lives of the workers and masses.

(People's Daily, Chongqing, March 31st) Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is vigorously grasping the plans and measures for the second quarter, and intensifying various production preparations.

As of March 28th, the company had already overfulfilled the first quarter's production plans for pig iron and steel. At the same time, it has also explored some new methods in production management and organization. These achievements have further strengthened the confidence of the workers in achieving greater victories, creating favorable conditions for completing the production plan for the second quarter.

The second quarter's production tasks for this company are heavier than those of the first quarter. To ensure the successful completion of the second quarter's production plan, the company's Party committee is further strengthening the Party's political and ideological work. In the first quarter, the company transferred a group of cadres to work as workers and organized eight work groups to go deep into the workshops to provide specific assistance. At the same time, leading cadres took the lead in participating in labor, timely solved some key production problems, and improved business work, which played a significant role in production. However, the weaknesses of insufficient leadership work, unclear responsibilities in certain links, and no one being responsible have not been completely overcome. In order to give full play to the core and leading role of Party groups and Party members, the company recently held an on-site meeting to exchange experiences in Party group work, emphasizing that Party groups must grasp production and care for the lives of workers through grasping political ideology. The entire company is launching a four-package (i.e., package completion of production tasks, package political and ideological work, package care for the masses' lives, package safe production) and four-comparison (compare soaring enthusiasm, compare overcoming difficulties, compare contacting the masses, compare Party spirit) competition among Party members. The coal gas team of the rail section of the large rolling mill originally had more ideological problems, and the workers were not united enough, which affected the completion of production tasks; after recently strengthening the Party's political and ideological work and leadership over production with Party members as the core and uniting the Communist Youth League members and activists, the workers achieved unprecedented unity, their work efficiency was significantly improved, and the isothermal time of the rails was reduced from 55 minutes in the past to 30 minutes. At the same time, the company's Party organization also strengthened its leadership over production teams and trade union groups.

In improving management work, the company's factories and workshops are currently establishing and improving the responsibility system in raw material management, production scheduling, equipment maintenance and repair, and technical management; at the same time, a post responsibility system is being established among employees, and "four determinations" are being implemented (determining posts, determining people, determining responsibilities, and determining specifications among workers, and determining people, determining things, determining responsibilities, and determining progress among cadres). In the process of establishing the responsibility system, the factories and workshops adopted the method of great airing, great contending, big-character posters, and great debate, airing and contending while improving.

In order to produce more and better steel in the second quarter, the company has studied and decided on the construction methods for transforming the furnace structure of large and small open-hearth furnaces, and is currently actively carrying out preparations before construction.

    抓决定性季度　打决定性胜仗
    鞍钢、重钢抓思想抓关键抓措施安排第二季度任务
    本报鞍山31日电　中共鞍山钢铁公司党委在28日召开厂矿长、党委书记会议，总结第一季度生产，安排第二季度任务。
    会议认为，第二季度是鞍钢生产大踏步前进的关键性季节，第二季度的任务要比第一季度大。完成全年计划的重大措施几乎都集中在第二季度。完成第二季度的各项任务，将给下半年更大跃进打下基础。为保证第二季度生产超额完成，会议要求各厂矿党组织，首先要抓紧思想工作。要发动群众总结第一季度工作，讲清当前形势，使全体职工鼓起更大干劲，切切实实地苦干巧干；党委、总支和支部的主要负责干部要立即深入群众，发动群众，把生产高潮推向更高阶段。其次，抓关键。围绕解决当前生产建设上的关键问题和薄弱环节，深入开展技术革命运动。要求厂矿、车间、工段、班、组以至个人都作出技术革命和技术革新的规划，每个时期集中力量攻克一、两个技术难关。各级党组织和工会要加强领导，并定期进行评比。各厂矿每月评比一次，车间、工段每旬或每周评比一次，公司决定每季大评大比一次。第三，抓措施。在第二季度施工的一百二十项措施，其中有基本建设工程三十二项，技术措施八十六项。这些重大措施要求统一安排，明确职责，确保按期、按质完成。每项重大措施每天检查一次进度。公司和公司党委决定每周检查一次措施执行情况。
    此外，会议还要求各厂矿党组织加强企业管理检查和整理现有规章制度，继续关心职工群众的生活。
    本报重庆31日电　重庆钢铁公司正在大抓第二季度的计划、措施，加紧进行各项生产准备工作。
    到3月28日为止，这个公司已经提前超额完成了第一季度生铁和钢材的生产计划。同时，在生产管理和组织工作方面，也摸索出了一些新的方法。这些成就更加增强了职工们取得更大胜利的信心，为完成第二季度的生产计划，创造了有利条件。
    这个公司第二季度生产任务要比第一季度繁重。为了保证第二季度的生产计划完满地完成，公司党委正进一步大力加强党的政治思想工作。在第一季度，这个公司下放了一批干部当工人、组织了八个工作组深入车间进行具体帮助。同时领导干部带头跟班参加劳动，及时解决了一些生产关键问题，改进了业务工作，对生产起了很大作用。但是，领导工作不够踏实、某些环节责任不明和无人负责的弱点还未完全克服。为了很好地发挥党小组和党员的核心、带头作用，公司最近开了交流党小组工作经验的现场会议，强调党小组必须通过抓政治思想来抓生产和关心职工的生活。全公司正在党员中发动开展四包
  （即包生产任务完成，包政治思想工作，包关心群众生活，包安全生产）、四比（比干劲冲天、比战胜困难、比联系群众、比党性）的竞赛运动。大型轧钢厂钢轨段煤气二班职工原来思想问题较多，工人之间不够团结，影响生产任务的完成；在最近以党员为核心，团结共青团员、积极分子加强了党的政治思想工作和对生产的领导以后，工人之间达到了空前的团结，工作效率显著提高，钢轨的等温时间由过去的五十五分钟减少到三十分钟。与此同时，公司党组织还加强了对生产小组和工会小组的领导。
    在改进管理工作上，目前这个公司各厂、各车间正在原材料管理、生产调度、设备维护检修、技术管理等方面建立和健全责任制；同时，在职工当中建立岗位责任制，实行“四定”（在工人中定岗位、定人、定责任、定规格，在干部中定人、定事、定责任、定进度）。在建立责任制过程中，各厂、各车间采取大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，一边鸣放，一边改进。
    为了在第二季度生产更多更好的钢，这个公司已经研究和决定了改造大小平炉的炉型构造的施工方法，目前正积极进行施工前的准备工作。（附图片）
    重庆钢铁公司正在加紧扩建，新的高炉和焦炉将要在“七一”和“八一”出铁和出焦。这是重钢建设工地一角。本报记者　刘诗临摄
