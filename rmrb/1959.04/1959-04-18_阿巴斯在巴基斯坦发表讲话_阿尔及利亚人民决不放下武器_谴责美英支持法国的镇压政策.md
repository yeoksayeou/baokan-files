Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, April 15th: After a three-day visit to Pakistan, the Prime Minister of the Algerian Provisional Government left Karachi today.

Prime Minister Abbas visited Ms. Jinnah today. On the evening of the 14th, he met with President Ayub Khan.

During his visit to Pakistan, Abbas repeatedly condemned French imperialism and the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said that the repressive policies implemented by France in Algeria are supported by the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—the United States and the United Kingdom.

He pointed out that France is not only able to command its North Atlantic Treaty Organization army divisions in Algeria, but also able to use North Atlantic Treaty Organization weapons in Algeria. He said that with the help of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the French are creating famine and massacring civilians, including women and children, in his country.

Abbas said, however, that the Algerian people have vowed never to lay down their arms until they achieve their goal of independence.

Many newspapers here published editorials on the 14th and 15th, welcoming Abbas and supporting the struggle of the Algerian people. "Today's News" said that the people of Pakistan are very sympathetic to the Algerian people. The newspaper said that the people of Pakistan regret that their government has not yet recognized the Algerian government. "Today's News" said, however, that the people of Pakistan sincerely recognize the Provisional Government as the only government representing Algeria.

The "Karachi Times" pointed out that the structure of imperialism is collapsing today under the pressure of the national movements in Asia and Africa. The newspaper said, "It is time for France and its Western allies to abandon their cruel policies, because the crimes of genocide and aggression will ultimately not benefit them."

Students at the University of Karachi presented Prime Minister Abbas with a letter written in blood on the 15th. The letter stated that they are willing to help the cause of Algerian independence.

News reports indicate that the students also sent a telegram to President Ayub Khan, requesting that the Pakistani government recognize the Algerian Provisional Government.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 14th: Karim Belkacem, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of the Algerian Provisional Government, told a reporter from the American magazine "Newsweek" yesterday that he is full of confidence in the victory of the Algerian national independence struggle. He said: "Time is on our side. If the (Algerian) war continues, within a year France will become an economic colony of Germany (West Germany)." He said that the morale of the Algerian National Liberation Army is very high. He also pointed out that this force has the deep support of the Algerian people. He said: "If I had weapons to give them, I could double the force in a month."

He stated that the Algerian Provisional Government opposes "autonomy within the French Community." It is willing to hold negotiations with France to comprehensively resolve the Algerian issue, and is willing to meet with representatives of the French government "in any neutral country proposed by France." At the same time, it rejects France's proposal for negotiations on a "ceasefire" because this may be a trick by France. He also pointed out that the current French plan to re-equip its army in Algeria and modernize it is "a bad omen" for negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo: The headquarters of the Algerian National Liberation Army issued a war report on the evening of the 10th, saying that from the 3rd to the 5th, the Algerian National Liberation Army launched seventeen attacks on French colonial army strongholds, engaged in seven battles, and ambushed French military convoys six times. The Algerian National Liberation Army shot down a French military aircraft near the town of Mettra, destroyed three French armored vehicles, and captured a large number of weapons and ammunition in these battles.

　　阿巴斯在巴基斯坦发表讲话
　　阿尔及利亚人民决不放下武器
　　谴责美英支持法国的镇压政策
    新华社卡拉奇15日电　阿尔及利亚临时政府总理在巴基斯坦访问三天后，今天离开卡拉奇。
    阿巴斯总理在今天拜访了真纳女士。14日晚上，他曾会见阿尤布汗总统。
    阿巴斯在巴基斯坦访问期间，曾一再谴责法帝国主义以及北大西洋公约组织国家。他说，法国在阿尔及利亚执行的镇压政策得到北大西洋公约组织成员国——美国和英国的支持。
    他指出，法国不仅能够在阿尔及利亚指挥它的北大西洋公约组织的陆军师，而且能够在阿尔及利亚使用北大西洋公约组织的武器，他说，法国人在北大西洋公约组织的帮助下，正在他的国家中制造饥荒和屠杀平民，其中，包括妇女和儿童。
    阿巴斯说，然而，阿尔及利亚人民立誓在他们达到独立目标之前，决不放下武器。
    这里许多报纸在14、15日发表社论，表示欢迎阿巴斯和支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。“今天报”说，巴基斯坦人民非常同情阿尔及利亚人民。这家报纸说，巴基斯坦人民对他们的政府至今还不承认阿尔及利亚政府感到很遗憾。“今天报”说，但是巴基斯坦人民真诚地承认临时政府，认为它是唯一代表阿尔及利亚的政府。
    “卡拉奇时报”指出，帝国主义的结构在亚非民族运动的压力下今天正在崩溃中。这家报纸说，“现在是法国和它的西方盟国放弃残忍的政策的时候了，因为种族绝灭和侵略的罪行到头来并不会使他们得到好处”。
    卡拉奇大学的学生在15日交给阿巴斯总理一封他们用血写成的信。信中表示，他们愿意帮助阿尔及利亚的独立事业。
    消息说，学生们还致电阿尤布汗总统，要求巴基斯坦政府承认阿尔及利亚临时政府。
    据新华社14日讯　纽约消息：阿尔及利亚临时政府副总理兼国防部长克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆昨天在接见美国“新闻周刊”记者时表示，他对阿尔及利亚民族独立斗争的胜利充满信心。他说：“时间对我们有利。如果（阿尔及利亚）战争继续下去，一年之内法国就要成为德国（西德）在经济上的殖民地。”他说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军的士气很高。他还指出，这支部队深得阿尔及利亚人民的拥护。他说：“假如我有武器给他们的话，在一个月内我就可以把部队扩大一倍。”
    他表示，阿尔及利亚临时政府反对“在法兰西共同体内的自治”。它愿意同法国举行全面解决阿尔及利亚问题的谈判，并且愿意同法国政府的代表“在法国建议的任何中立国家”里会谈。同时，它拒绝法国关于谈判“停火”的建议，因为这可能是法国的诡计。他还指出，目前法国计划重新装备它在阿尔及利亚的军队并且使它现代化，这种作法对谈判来说是“一个恶兆”。
    新华社开罗讯　阿尔及利亚民族解放军总部10日晚上发表战报说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在3日到5日期间，向法国殖民军队的据点发动了十七次攻击，进行了七次战斗，并且对法军运输队进行了六次伏击。阿尔及利亚民族解放军在迈特拉镇附近击落了一架法国军用飞机，击毁了三辆法军装甲车，并且在这些战斗中缴获了大量武器和弹药。
