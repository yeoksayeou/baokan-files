Xinhua News Agency, April 12th: The employees of the Twelfth Team of the Jiulongshan Motor Vehicle Depot of the Beijing Transportation Company have collectively created the "tractor-trailer swap body transport method," increasing transportation efficiency more than fourfold. Currently, each truck in this team transports 108 tons of goods per day, increased from the previous 20.8 tons. Three trucks can now complete the tasks that previously required eighteen trucks.

This team primarily transports grain and coal. The "tractor-trailer swap body transport method" has been implemented continuously in this team for several months with very good results. Now, the "one truck, three trailers" motorcade has increased from transporting four times a day to nine times a day. Due to the concentration of loading and unloading work, the number of loaders has also been reduced by more than half compared to the past.

　　北京创“拖车甩挂运输法”  运输效率提高了四倍多
    据新华社12日讯　北京市运输公司九龙山汽车场第十二小队职工集体创造“拖车甩挂运输法”，提高运输效率四倍多。目前这个小队每辆汽车每天拖运的货物由过去二十点八吨提高到一百零八吨，三辆汽车就能完成过去十八辆汽车才能完成的任务。
    这个小队主要是运输粮食和煤，“拖车甩挂运输法”在这个小队连续实行几个月以来，成绩很好。现在，“一车三挂”的汽车列车已经由每天运输四次提高到九次。由于装卸工作集中，装卸工人也比过去减少了一半以上。
