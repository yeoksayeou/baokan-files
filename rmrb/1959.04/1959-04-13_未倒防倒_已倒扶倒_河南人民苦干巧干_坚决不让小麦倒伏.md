　　Prevent lodging before it happens, support lodged wheat after it happens.
　　The people of Henan work hard and skillfully to resolutely prevent wheat lodging.
    (Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 12th dispatch) Currently, Henan Province is focusing on preventing lodging in high-yield wheat fields and launching a campaign to eliminate third-class wheat seedlings, ensuring a bumper wheat harvest and high yields per mu this year.
    This year, wheat growth throughout the province is generally good. However, along with the good growth, there are many differences in farming practices compared to previous years, which have led to some new problems and contradictions. For example, this year, wheat has been widely deep-plowed and densely planted, promoting early development and rapid growth of wheat seedlings. In particular, some satellite fields are even more lush and growing vigorously. Although various regions have taken doubled measures in management compared to previous years in response to this year's production characteristics, they are still not fully adapted to the demands of dense planting and vigorous growth. Therefore, some satellite fields are already beginning to lodge due to excessive density and poor ventilation. As the weather warms up and wheat grows rapidly, the trend of lodging is developing further. According to incomplete statistics, lodging has occurred in more than 700,000 mu of wheat fields across the province. To prevent and salvage lodged wheat, all regions in the province are taking lodging prevention as a major measure in current wheat field management. Many regions are using the experience of local people to create many methods to prevent lodging. There are approximately five practical and effective methods that have been summarized across the province:
　　(1) Remove weak seedlings, old leaves, and yellow leaves. Yanshi, Wuyang, Lushan, Zhengzhou and other places have had good results using this method to prevent wheat lodging. Pruning leaves before lodging occurs increases light exposure, inhibits excessive growth, and promotes thick and hard basal roots and reduces internode length. Wheat fields that have taken this measure early generally do not lodge. (2) Thinning seedlings. Changge, Zhongmu and other counties have appropriately thinned weak seedlings in densely planted experimental fields and high-yield fields, which has also promoted the robust growth of wheat seedlings and prevented lodging. In the youth experimental field of Zengfumiao People's Commune in Changge County, one row of wheat seedlings is removed every foot to facilitate ventilation and sunshine. The removed seedlings can still sprout and produce ears later. (3) Soil cultivation. Experiments at the Kaifeng Prefectural Agricultural Science Institute have shown that appropriate soil cultivation between wheat rows not only allows wheat to ventilate and receive light, but also buries some ineffective tillers, reduces nutrient consumption, and makes the stems thick. (4) Increase the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and wood ash. (5) For excessively dense experimental fields, scaffolding and netting can be used. Nanyang Prefecture has already built lodging prevention frames in more than 350,000 mu of wheat fields.
　　The enthusiasm of the masses across the province to prevent lodging is very high. In order to salvage the lodged wheat, many regions have organized professional teams to work hard in shifts day and night. The Zengfumiao People's Commune in Changge County has more than 10,000 laborers who are working around the clock to prevent and control lodging in wheat. In two days, they rescued all the more than 2,000 mu of lodged wheat fields in the commune and applied phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and wood ash to the large fields.
　　The Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences recently held an on-site conference on lodging prevention in the suburbs of Zhengzhou to summarize and exchange experiences in lodging prevention from various places, preparing to promote them throughout the province.
　　While preventing lodging, a campaign to eliminate third-class seedlings is booming throughout the province. According to recent statistics from inspection stations and teams in various places, there are still about 10 million mu of third-class wheat fields across the province. In order to eliminate third-class seedlings, various regions have adopted methods of applying more water and fertilizer. Luoyang Prefecture has applied top dressing to more than 290,000 mu of third-class wheat; Lin County in Xinxiang Prefecture has 150,000 people involved in the campaign to eliminate third-class seedlings every day. All of the county's 74,000 mu of third-class wheat has been eliminated, and more than 80% has caught up with or surpassed the original second-class wheat seedlings. Yiyang County in Luoyang Prefecture proposed in the campaign to eliminate third-class seedlings: not only should third-class wheat fields be eliminated, but also third-class seedlings in first- and second-class wheat fields should be eliminated, and a campaign of block-by-block inspection and comprehensive investigation of all areas has been carried out throughout the county.

### 未倒防倒　已倒扶倒  河南人民苦干巧干  坚决不让小麦倒伏

　　未倒防倒　已倒扶倒
　　河南人民苦干巧干  坚决不让小麦倒伏
    本报郑州12日电　河南省当前大抓防止丰产田小麦倒伏和突击消灭三类麦苗，确保今年小麦块块丰收、亩亩高产。
    今年全省各地的小麦生长普遍良好，但是随着生长好的情况，和耕作制度上与往年有许多不相同的地方，因而出现了一些新问题和新矛盾。比如，今年小麦普遍深耕、密植，促使麦苗发育早，生长快，特别是部分卫星田更是茂密，猛长，虽然各地针对今年生产的特点，在管理上已经采取了比往年加倍的措施，但是与密植、猛长的要求还是不完全相适应。因此，当前有些卫星田由于过密，影响通风已经开始倒伏，随着天气转暖，小麦猛长，倒伏的趋势还在发展。据不完全统计，全省有七十多万亩麦田已经发生了倒伏的现象，为了防止和挽救倒伏的小麦，全省各个地区都把防倒伏作为当前麦田管理的一项主要措施。不少地区都运用当地群众的经验，创造了许多防止倒伏的办法。全省综合起来大约有五种切实可行、效果显著的办法：
  （1）剔瘦苗、去老叶、黄叶。偃师、舞阳、鲁山、郑州等地使用这种办法防止小麦倒伏效果很好。在没有倒伏的时候剪叶，增加光照，抑制陡长，促使基根粗硬，减少节间长度，凡是及早采取了这种办法的麦田，一般都没有倒伏。（2）疏苗。长葛、中牟等县在密度过大的试验田和丰产田中，适当疏除弱苗，也促使了麦苗生长粗壮，防止了倒伏。长葛县增福庙人民公社青年试验场，每隔一尺铲去一垅麦苗，以利通风向阳，被铲的苗日后照样可以发出芽头、出穗。（3）培土。开封专区农业科学研究所的试验，在麦垅行间进行适当培土，不仅能使小麦通风透光，而且掩埋了一部分无效分蘖，减少养分消耗，使茎节粗壮。（4）增施磷钾肥和草木灰。（5）过密的试验田可搭架拉网。南阳专区已在三十五万多亩的麦田中搭好了防倒伏架。
    全省广大群众防倒伏的劲头非常高，很多地区为了把倒伏的麦子挽救过来，都组织了专业大军，日夜轮番苦战。长葛县增福庙人民公社有一万多劳力，日夜突击防治倒伏的小麦，在两天内，把全社已倒伏的二千多亩麦田全部抢救过来，并且对大田普施了一次磷钾肥料和草木灰。
    省农业科学研究所最近也在郑州市郊召开了防倒伏的现场会议，总结交流各地防倒伏的经验，准备在全省推广。
    在防倒伏的同时，一个以消灭三类苗的突击运动正在全省蓬勃的开展。据最近各地检查站、队的统计，全省还有一千万亩左右的三类麦田，为了突击消灭三类苗，各地都采取偏浇水，偏施肥的办法。洛阳专区已对三类麦施追肥二十九万多亩；新乡专区的林县，每天有十五万人投入突击消灭三类苗运动。全县七万四千多亩三类麦已经全部消灭，并且有80％以上已经赶上或超过原来的二类麦苗。洛阳专区宜阳县在突击消灭三类苗运动中，提出：不仅要消灭三类麦田，还要消灭一、二类麦田中的三类苗，在全县开展了块块查、片片普查的运动。　（方徨）
