Touring Sichuan and Seeing New Trends
Written collectively by our newspaper's correspondents in Sichuan

In the hopeful spring, touring Sichuan, the "Land of Abundance," the abundant harvest scenes and the people's soaring enthusiasm fill people with boundless joy for the great leap forward of the motherland this year.

	Fresh Wheat Seedlings, Fragrant Rapeseed
Along the continuous "bumper harvest road," passing through the vast Chengdu Plain, across the undulating banks of the Yangtze River, and all the way to the foot of the towering Daba Mountains, on the fertile fields of the thousand-mile basin, the green wheat and golden rapeseed, like waves of the vast ocean, roll forward. The province's 23 million mu of wheat and 6 million mu of rapeseed are heading, flowering, and podding, and a great harvest is already in sight. Each mu of wheat seedlings generally has 300,000 to 500,000 ears, and even more in high-yield areas. Some farmers say, "When you're tired from working, go to the slope and look at the wheat, and you'll have even more energy!"

The high-yield team members of the Wanchun People's Commune in Wenjiang County manage 50 mu of high-yield wheat, with the number of effective plants generally exceeding 800,000, and each ear bearing 30 to 40 grains. In order to prevent the wheat from lodging later and overcome wind and rain, they are strengthening their field management work more and more. Everyone takes turns guarding the fields day and night, ensuring "support if it falls, prevent it from falling if it doesn't, and support it while it's falling." In addition to applying a lot of phosphorus fertilizer, grass ash, and special anti-lodging agents, they have built layers of bamboo fences around the wheat ridges, inserted branches and bamboo strips in the middle of the wheat ridges, and even set up windbreaks on the windward side. It is truly step-by-step defense, block-by-block protection. Most of the wheat in the fields is growing extra strong. A small amount of wheat that has fallen has been rescued, and stands upright again, gazing proudly at the sky.

When we arrived in Xindu County, which launched a national rapeseed high-yield competition, the more than 50,000 mu of robust rapeseed here were already more than one person tall in some places. The tall and tender green branches are covered with golden rapeseed flowers, a brilliant scene and rich fragrance, attracting many butterflies and bees, and receiving much praise from visitors!

Parting the dense branches of rapeseed on both sides, along the small path in the field, Liu Faxiu, the branch secretary of the first cultivation area of the Guihu People's Commune, led us to their 594 mu of victory rapeseed field. The rapeseed here grows entirely like small bushes, with the main stem as thick as two or three thumbs. The crisscrossing branches seal the earth, making it impossible for people to enter, and even sparrows can't fly in!

"How can you topdress this?" we asked in surprise.

"We have already topdressed more than ten times, and we plan to topdress three to five more times. Come and see," Liu Faxiu said, bending down, parting the branches, and pointing to the ground covered with fertilizer, "People can't get in, but water can always flow in. In addition, we have also created a tool: a long bamboo tube and a piston. People stand on the edge of the field, pour the liquid manure from one end of the bamboo tube, and it flows from the other end to the roots of the rapeseed."

Spring plowing is surging forward
The scene of summer harvest crops with great hopes for a bumper harvest has promoted spring plowing and set off an even greater upsurge.

When reporters came to the old revolutionary base area in the Daba Mountains of northern Sichuan on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, smoke from the fertilizer-making kilns rose in the melting snow-covered mountains and dense forests, and songs flew over the vast fields where people were deep-plowing the land and sowing seeds. The upsurge of spring plowing production among the people in the old revolutionary base areas along the Tongjiang and Jialing Rivers is like a turbulent river, surging, with every person and every family involved in the movement.

"People's voices roar, red flags flutter, high-yield enthusiasm shakes the mountains," this is a portrayal of the upsurge of production competitions on both sides of the Yangtze River in southern Sichuan. In order to ensure that the rice is fully planted, tens of thousands of waterwheels were erected along the Tuo River and the Yangtze River, and commune members stripped to the waist and stepped on them quickly. These dozens or even hundreds of waterwheels connected together are like giant dragons, with one end stretched into the river, sucking up the river water, crossing the heavy hills, and spewing it into the terraced fields.

When we arrived at the Shidong People's Commune in Luxian County, the spring sowing competition between teams was just being announced. Unexpectedly, this time the banner was taken by the Yihe Production Team, which was often rated as a backward team.

"There's no secret to winning the award, as long as you are determined to learn from the advanced, you will definitely catch up!" The production team leader said excitedly to the people while accepting the award banner.

In order to catch up with the advanced, they specially sent more than 60 cadres and commune members to the best Shuming Production Team in the commune to "learn from experience" at the beginning of spring sowing. These representatives included branch secretaries, team leaders, and commune members, who visited their respective "counterparts" and compared them with their own work, and found out the lessons from experience. After returning from the visit, the entire team immediately held a mobilization meeting to convey and discuss the deeds of the cadres and masses of the Shuming Production Team working together diligently and skillfully, and set the goals for the competition. They loudly put forward the slogan "Remove the third-class hat and plant red flags in the whole team." From then on, everyone worked hard with one heart and one mind, and finally became the champion in terms of fast sowing progress and good quality.

"If we don't get it this time, we'll see how it goes next time," the other production teams that lagged behind in the evaluation were determined to catch up.

Everyone's enthusiasm soared
In the Shunjiang Commune on the banks of the Tuo River, we visited the family of commune member Zheng Yinsheng. This ordinary commune member family, three generations of people, everyone has their own aspirations in the Great Leap Forward. His son, Zheng Shunyuan, is cultivating one mu of high-yield rice with others; his daughter-in-law is raising two cattle alone; Zheng Yinsheng is nearly seventy years old and is responsible for guarding one mu of wheat striving for 5,000 jin per mu; his old partner, Zheng Fuxian, is as old as him, and also manages one mu of peas striving for 500 jin per mu; the child Zheng Bamin is studying in high school and is also trying to grow one mu of high-yield sugar cane with the teacher at school. This elementary school student proudly wrote in his notebook: "Our family, grandpa, grandma, dad, mom, and I, all have our own high-yield goals this year!"

Female Communist Party member Chen Jiying and Youth League member Xu Xiyun are an unmarried couple and are also the captain and deputy captain of the Youth High-Yield Team of the Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County. The youth planting team they led was famous throughout the province last autumn for creating a new record for high-yield mid-season rice. This year, the 22 young people in the team are determined to build on last year's experience and work with other commune members to go to a higher level and strive for a larger area of ​​high-yield production. To achieve this ideal, they have been accumulating fertilizer day and night, and have prepared 250,000 jin of "grass food" per mu. When the reporter saw them, the entire team was working hard in the fields. Chen Jiying wiped her sweat and said:

"Look at their enthusiasm, moving mountains will collapse, splitting rivers will open up, no difficulties can stop us!"

Spring plowing is like fighting a war, and young and middle-aged people are all heading to the front line; those who stick to the rear are also doing their best to contribute their strength.

"What I dream of, what I do when I wake up, is how to make all the commune members eat their fill, eat well, be strong, and fight the battle of spring plowing!" Dai Shuyu, the model cook of the Hongguang Central Canteen, who was cooking, said that every day when people are still asleep, they get up to light the fire and cook. Their canteen not only has a variety of dishes, good taste, but also clean and hygienic.

    周游四川看新潮
    本报驻四川记者集体采写
    在充满希望的春天里，周游一下“天府之国”的四川，出现在眼前的大丰收景象和人民的冲天干劲，使人们对祖国今年的大跃进，感到无比欢欣。
        麦苗鲜　油菜香
    沿着连绵的“丰产路”，穿过辽阔的川西平原，越过起伏不平的长江两岸，直到高峻的大巴山下，千里盆地的沃野上，绿荡荡的小麦，金闪闪的油菜，像汪洋大海的波涛，滚滚向前。全省二千三百万亩小麦，六百多万亩油菜，正在吐穗扬花，开花结荚，大丰收已经在望。每亩麦苗一般都有三、五十万穗，高产地更多。有些农民说：“干活干累了，到坡上看看小麦，身上的干劲就更大了！”
    温江县万春人民公社高产队队员们经营的五十亩高产小麦，有效株数普遍在八十万株以上，每穗结子三四十粒。为了防止小麦后期倒伏，战胜风雨袭击，他们的田间管理工作，越来越加强了，大家日夜轮番在田野里看守着，做到“有倒扶倒、无倒防倒、边倒边扶”。他们除了增施许多磷肥、草木灰和特制的防伏素外，麦垅四周扎起层层竹栏杆，麦垅中间插上树枝和竹条，向风的一面还设有防风栅。真是步步为营、块块设防。大部分田里的麦子都长得分外健壮。少数倒了的麦子，经抢救后，重新站立起来，傲然地望着天空。
    我们到达向全国发起油菜高产竞赛的新都县时，这里的五万多亩茁壮的油菜，有些长的一人多高了。高大嫩绿的枝苔上，披戴着金色的菜花，灿烂的景色、浓郁的花香，招来多少蝶飞蜂唱，得到多少参观者的诵扬！
    拨开两旁油菜繁茂的枝叶，顺着田中小道，桂湖人民公社第一耕作区支部书记刘发修，把我们引到他们经营的一片五百九十四亩胜利油菜田里。这儿的油菜长得全像小树丛一样，主干有两三个大拇指粗。纵横交错的枝苔，密封大地，莫说人进不去，就是落进麻雀也飞不起呢！
    “这怎样能追肥呢？”我们惊异地问道。
    “我们已经追过十多次肥料，还准备再追三五道，你来看，”刘发修说着弯下腰，拨开枝苔，指着铺满肥料的地面，“人进不去，水总是能流进去的。另外，我们还创造了一种工具：一根长长的竹筒，一根活塞，人站在地边上，把水粪从竹筒这头灌进去，它就从竹筒那边流到油菜的根部。”春耕热潮浪滔滔
    大有丰收希望的夏收作物的景象，推动了春耕生产，掀起更大的高潮。
    当记者来到川北大巴山区川陕边境的老根据地时，积雪开始融化的丛山密林里，造肥的火灰窑冒出的烟雾弥漫，广阔的田野上，深翻土地和播种的人群歌声飞扬。通江河嘉陵江两岸老根据地的人民，春耕生产热潮像湍急的江流，波浪汹涌，每一人、每一个家庭全都卷到运动中来了。
    “人声吼，红旗飘，高产干劲动山摇”，这是川南长江两岸生产竞赛热潮的写照。为了保证水稻满栽满插，沿着沱江、长江，架起了数以万计的水车，社员们打着赤膊在上面飞快地踩着。这些几十架甚至上百架连在一起的水车，像一条条巨龙，一头伸在江里，把江水吸起来，翻过重重山岗，喷吐到层层叠叠的梯田里。
    我们到达泸县石洞人民公社访问时，那里队与队短兵相接的春播竞赛，正好揭晓。出人意料的是，这次帅旗竟被常被评为落后队的义和生产队拿去了。
    “得奖没有啥秘密，只要决心学先进，那就准会赶得上！”生产队长在接受奖旗时兴奋地向人们说道。
    他们为了赶上先进，春播一开始，就专门派了六十多名干部和社员到全社最好的树明生产队“取经”。这些代表中有支部书记、队长、社员，他们分别访问了自己的“同行”，并和本身的工作进行对比，从中找出经验教训。访问回来后，全队立刻召开了誓师大会，传达讨论了树明生产队干部群众齐心合力、苦干巧干的事迹，订出了竞赛努力的目标。响亮地提出“摘掉三类帽，全队插红旗”的口号。从此上下一心，埋头苦干，终于成为播种进度快、质量好的冠军。
    “这次没评上，下次见高低”，在评比中落后了的其他生产队都决心迎头赶上。
      人人干劲冲天
    在沱江岸边的顺江公社里，我们访问了社员郑银盛的家庭。这一户普通的社员，一家三代人，人人在大跃进里，都有自己的志向。儿子郑顺元和别人一起培植一亩高产水稻；儿媳一人饲养了两头耕牛；郑银盛已经年近七十，负责看管争取一亩亩产五千斤的小麦；他的老伴郑富仙和他一样高龄了，也管了一亩争取亩产五百斤的豌豆；小孩子郑柏民在高小读书，也在学校和老师一起试种了一亩高产甘蔗。这个小学生，在笔记本上自豪地写道：“我们家里爷爷、奶奶、爸爸、妈妈和我，今年都有自己的高产目标！”
    女共产党员陈季英和青年团员徐希云，是一对未婚夫妇，又是郫县红光人民公社青年高产队正副队长。他们领导的青年种植组，去年秋天，曾以创造中稻高产的新纪录闻名全省。今年全队的二十二个青年，决心根据去年的经验，和其他社员一起，更上一层楼，争取更大面积的高额丰产。为实现这个理想，他们日夜积肥，已给每亩准备好了二十五万斤的“草粮”。当记者看到他们的时候，全队人员正在田野上紧张劳动。陈季英揩着汗说道：
    “你看他们那股干劲，搬山山倒，劈河河开，什么困难也不能把我们挡倒！”
    春耕像打仗一样，青壮年都开赴第一线；坚守后方的人，也都千方百计贡献着自己的力量。
    “我梦里想的，醒来做的，就是怎么样叫全体社员吃饱、吃好，身强力壮，打好春耕这一仗！”正在炒菜的红光中心食堂的模范炊事员戴淑玉说，每天当人们还在熟睡的时候，他们就起来烧火做饭了。他们的食堂，不但饭菜花样多，味道好，而且清洁卫生。
