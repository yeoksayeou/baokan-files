Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of the various leading comrades.

The Great Achievements of Bridge Construction in 1958

In the process of vigorously developing our national economy to build a socialist society, 1958 marked a year of extreme brilliance and leap-forward progress since liberation. This was specifically embodied in the remarkable achievement of doubling the annual steel and grain output. These achievements are not only unprecedented in our country's history, but also have never been seen in any advanced country in the world.

Since the achievements of the bridge construction industry are a correct reflection of the achievements in the construction of the national transportation industry, and the development of the transportation industry is an important link in developing the national economy, the huge bridge construction tasks completed by the Railway Ministry's Bridge Engineering Bureau in 1958 fully demonstrated the unprecedented victory of the comprehensive leap forward in our national economic construction.

Under the correct leadership of the Party, and because of the implementation of the Party's general line for building socialism, the Railway Ministry's Bridge Engineering Bureau, based on the successful completion of the first major bridge over the Yangtze River in our country – the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in 1957 – actually completed 39.08 million yuan in the execution of the 1958 national bridge construction capital construction plan with a total investment of 28.06 million yuan, fulfilling 139% of the annual plan. This is entirely in line with the situation of the comprehensive leap forward in national economic construction.

The projects completed and put into use throughout the year include: (1) Han River Railway Bridge double-track girder erection project, (2) Hankou Jiefang Avenue overpass project, (3) Zhongyun Canal temporary bridge project, (4) Tongguan Yellow River temporary bridge project, (5) Zhang River Bridge project, (6) Ji River Bridge project, (7) Anyang River Bridge project, (8) Second Songhua River Bridge girder erection project, (9) Min River Bridge girder erection project, (10) Hutuo River Bridge project, (11) Wuchang Niuyutao Bridge project, (12) Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Corp. trestle bridge, and other twelve projects. The total length of the bridges transferred was 5,195.61 meters, including 133 spans of steel beams, weighing a total of 8,181 tons, 24 spans of reinforced concrete beams, and 24,654 cubic meters of poured concrete and reinforced concrete.

The newly started projects throughout the year include: (1) Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge project, which started on May 14, 1958; (2) Zhongyun Canal main bridge project, which started on June 19, 1958; (3) Nanchang Gan River Bridge project, which started on September 30, 1958; (4) Chongqing Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge project, which started on September 10, 1958; (5) Pearl River Bridge project, which started on October 19, 1958.

In addition, the emergency repair project of the old Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge was completed in a concentrated effort over seven days and nights in late July, and technical support tasks for the Mingshan Reservoir and Baotou Steel (Group) Corp. pumping station projects were also completed.

The above situation specifically illustrates the comprehensive great leap forward in 1958. The fundamental reasons for this great leap forward are the correct leadership of the Party and the Ministry of Railways, the personal involvement of Party committees at all levels, the launching of a vigorous mass movement, and the great power exerted by the Party's general line for socialist construction.

The Grand Plan for Bridge Construction in 1959

The railway bridge construction plan for 1959, in order to ensure the completion of the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton in the national economy in 1959, especially the task of 18 million tons of steel, the bridge construction tasks we undertake are even more grand than in 1958. This is a plan that is even more of a leap forward than in 1958.

The main progress of each project is as follows: (1) Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge project: the substructure can be completed in the first half of this year, and the entire project can be completed by the end of this year if the steel beams are supplied in time; (2) Chongqing Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge project: the substructure can be completed in May, and the entire project can be completed by the end of this year; (3) Nanchang Gan River Bridge project: the substructure can be completed by the end of May, and the entire project can be completed by the end of this year if the steel beams are supplied in time; (4) Guangzhou Pearl River Bridge project: the substructure can be completed by the end of July, and the entire project can be completed by the end of this year if the steel beams are supplied in time; (5) Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge project: this year, the main task is to complete all construction preparation work and the test pier project, and to carry out the construction of the approach bridge project.

In addition, three outsourced projects will be completed according to the scheduled progress: (1) Zhongyun Canal main bridge project, (2) Beijing Dongbianmen Canal Bridge project, (3) Jinsha River Bridge girder erection project.

Comprehensive of the above situation, it can be seen that the 1959 plan is an active plan. In order to realize this plan, we must continue to exert full effort, make full use of favorable conditions, and overcome various difficulties in the course of advancement and development.

Accumulating Rich Experience and Creating Advanced Technology

As long as we take measures in every possible way and make full use of favorable conditions, all kinds of difficulties can be solved easily. Our existing favorable conditions are: (1) the full attention and strong support of the whole Party and the whole people for bridge construction; (2) after last year's great leap forward, the vast number of employees in the bureau created many advanced experiences in the vigorous mass movement. As long as we continue to adhere to the policy of launching a large-scale mass movement in the future, and further promote and improve these rich experiences, more potential will continue to emerge; (3) the Ministry of Railways has given favorable status in the arrangement of investment and the allocation of materials, especially steel.

The reason why the Bridge Engineering Bureau was able to achieve a great leap forward in bridge construction tasks in 1958 and is expected to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959 is determined by the continuous improvement and development of the advanced pipe pile drilling method in terms of engineering technology. Through the practice of various bridge projects after the Wuhan Bridge project, we have achieved a leap forward in the construction methods of sinking pipe piles and building bridge pier foundations. Therefore, we were able to build a deep-water bridge pier foundation with a large pipe pile of 5.8 meters in diameter in an average of twelve days in the Nanchang Gan River Bridge, creating an unprecedented miracle in bridge engineering.

The accumulation and enrichment of these experiences has laid a good foundation for us to build the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, which is built in more difficult natural conditions and more complex technology. The arduousness and complexity of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in terms of engineering technology far exceeds that of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which we successfully completed in 1957. From the perspective of engineering volume, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is equivalent to 2.5 to 3.3 times that of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. In fact, from the perspective of the arduousness and complexity of underwater engineering, the degree to which the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge exceeds the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is difficult to express by simple numerical ratios. The depth of the pier foundation of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is comparable to that of the extremely famous Golden Gate Bridge in the world. Therefore, in the process of building the Nanjing Bridge, we must further develop new technologies for the pipe pile drilling method, which requires further research and exploration in theory and further experimentation, exploration, and invention in construction. Therefore, we have already organized many domestic universities, scientific research institutes, and related manufacturing units to carry out 39 special research projects on bridge engineering technology, in order to give full play to the infinite wisdom of the masses and achieve the effect of collective wisdom. At the same time, on the issue of bridge science and technology research, we also maintain close contact with relevant scientific research institutions in the Soviet Union to absorb and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

The Socialist System is the Source and Guarantee of Victory

It should be emphasized that the reason why we can carry out the great bridge building task of "building a bridge to turn any ravine into a thoroughfare" on any major river in our country today is inseparable from the establishment of the people's democratic power. Before liberation, although our country also built several relatively famous bridges domestically, not only were there very few of them, but they were also greatly flawed in terms of effectiveness and engineering quality. What is even more regrettable is that they were all built by imperialism on our behalf. For example, the old Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge was built by French and Belgian imperialism on our behalf, and the Jinan Yellow River Bridge was built by the German imperialist Meng'an Company on our behalf. The Pearl River Bridge, which we are currently building, was also once started by the American imperialist Mackton Company on our behalf. However, this bridge was not only not completed, but the parts that had already been built were of very poor quality. For example, only five of the six piers of the east bridge of the bridge were made, and the caissons were all skewed. Only six of the seven piers of the west bridge were made, and none of them reached the design elevation, and all of them were tilted. Now, when we are building this bridge, although we have spent a lot of effort to reinforce and utilize the piers of the east bridge, we have had to completely abandon the piers of the west bridge and build new piers separately. This specific example in front of us, as well as the stagnant and backward state of bridge construction in our country before liberation, and the sharp contrast between the rapid development of leaps and bounds today, fully illustrates that if the state power is not in the hands of the people – that is, in the hands of the working class vanguard Communist Party, the country is completely impossible to carry out construction, and the country's construction will not be built well. On the contrary, after the people have mastered the power, the country can leap forward and realize a series of earth-shattering construction work that was difficult for predecessors to carry out, and can thoroughly do these works one by one. The achievements of a series of major bridge engineering construction that the Bridge Engineering Bureau has already completed and is carrying out in recent years since liberation provide the most powerful and undeniable demonstration.

### 任何天堑都能变通途  顾懋勋委员的发言

    任何天堑都能变通途
    顾懋勋委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的报告。一九五八年桥梁建设的巨大成就
    在大力发展我国国民经济以建设社会主义社会的过程中，一九五八年标志着解放以后备极光辉灿烂和飞跃前进的一年，具体体现在钢的年产量和粮食年产量的加番增长的卓越成就上，这些成就不特在我国系属史无前例，就是在世界任何先进国家里也是从未曾有的。
    由于桥梁建设事业的成就系为国家交通运输事业建设成就的正确反映，而发展交通运输事业系为发展国民经济的重要环节，铁道部大桥工程局在一九五八年所完成的巨大桥梁建设任务充分表明了我国国民经济建设全面跃进的空前胜利。
    在党的正确领导下，由于贯彻了党在建设社会主义时期的总路线，铁道部大桥工程局在我国第一大川——长江上的第一座大桥——武汉长江大桥于一九五七年胜利完成的基础上，在执行一九五八年国家建桥基本建设计划投资总额二千八百零六万元的大桥建设任务中，实际完成了三千九百零八万元，完成年度计划的百分之一百三十九，这是完全符合于国民经济建设全面跃进的形势的。
    全年竣工交付使用的工程计有：（1）汉水铁路桥复线架梁工程，（2）汉口解放大道跨线桥工程，（3）中运河便桥工程，（4）潼关黄河便桥工程，（5）漳河大桥工程，（6）泲河桥工程，（7）安阳河桥工程，（8）第二松花江桥架梁工程，（9）岷江桥架梁工程，（10）滹沱河大桥工程，（11）武昌鲇鱼套桥工程，（12）武钢栈桥等十二项工程。全部移交工程桥梁总长为五千一百九十五点六一公尺，其中钢梁一百三十三孔，共重八千一百八十一吨，钢筋混凝土梁二十四孔，灌注混凝土和钢筋混凝土二万四千六百五十四立公方。
    全年新开工的工程计有：（1）郑州黄河大桥工程，于一九五八年五月十四日开工；（2）中运河正桥工程，于一九五八年六月十九日开工；（3）南昌赣江大桥工程，于一九五八年九月三十日开工；（4）重庆白沙沱长江大桥工程，于一九五八年九月十日开工；（5）珠江大桥工程，于一九五八年十月十九日开工。
    此外，于七月下旬以七昼夜的时间突击完成了郑州黄河大桥老桥的抢修工程，另又完成了明山水库与包钢水泵站工程的技术支援任务。
    以上情况，具体说明了一九五八年全面大跃进的情况。出现这个大跃进的根本原因是党和铁道部的正确领导，是各级党委亲自挂帅，掀起轰轰烈烈的群众运动，是党的社会主义建设的总路线所发挥出来的伟大的力量。
    一九五九年桥梁建设的宏伟计划
    一九五九年铁路桥梁建设计划，为了确保一九五九年国民经济的钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的完成，特别是一千八百万吨钢的任务完成，我们担负的建桥任务较一九五八年更为宏伟，这是比一九五八年更为跃进的计划。
    各项工程主要进度为：（1）郑州黄河大桥工程，今年上半年下部建筑可全部完成，在钢梁及时供应的情况下，今年年底可完成全部工程；（2）重庆白沙沱长江大桥工程，于五月下部建筑可全部完成，于年底可完成全部工程；（3）南昌赣江大桥工程，五月底下部建筑可全部完成，在钢梁及时供应的情况下，今年年底可完成全部工程；（4）广州珠江大桥工程，七月底下部建筑可全部完成，在钢梁及时供应的情况下，今年年底可完成全部工程；（5）南京长江大桥工程今年主要完成全部施工准备工作和试验墩工程，并进行引桥工程的修建工作。
    此外，还要按照预定进度完成三项外委工程：（1）中运河正桥工程，（2）北京东便门运河桥工程，（3）金沙江桥架梁工程。
    综合以上情况，可见一九五九年的计划是一个积极的计划。为了实现这个计划，必须继续鼓足干劲，充分运用有利条件，并克服各种前进中和发展中的困难。
    积累了丰富经验创造着先进技术
    只要千方百计地采取措施，充分运用有利条件，各种困难都可迎刃而解的。我们现有的有利条件是：（1）全党全民对桥梁建设的十分重视和大力支持；（2）经过去年的大跃进，全局职工轰轰烈烈的群众运动中创造出不少的先进经验，只要今后继续坚持大搞群众运动的方针，进一步推广和提高这些丰富的经验，就会有更多的潜力不断涌现出来；（3）铁道部在投资的安排和材料特别是钢材的分配上，都给了有利的地位。
    大桥工程局所以能够取得一九五八年建桥任务的大跃进以及预期在一九五九年取得更大的跃进，在工程技术上，系决定于先进的管柱钻孔法的不断改进和发展。通过武汉大桥工程以后的各个大桥工程的实践，我们在下沉管柱和修建桥墩基础的施工方法上得到了飞跃的发展，因此我们能在南昌赣江大桥以平均十二天的时间修成一个五点八公尺直径大型管柱的深水桥墩基础，创造了桥梁工程上前所未有的奇迹。
    这些经验的积累和丰富就替我们对修建在自然条件更为困难，技术更为复杂的南京长江大桥打好了良好的基础。南京长江大桥在工程技术上的艰巨性和复杂性远远超过了我们在一九五七年胜利完成的武汉长江大桥。从工程量来看，南京长江大桥相当于武汉长江大桥的二点五至三点三倍；事实上，从水下工程的艰巨性和复杂性来看，南京长江大桥所超过武汉长江大桥的程度，是难以用简单的数字比例加以表达出来的。南京长江大桥桥墩基础的深度已和世界上极为著名的旧金山海峡大桥不相上、下。因此，在修建南京大桥的过程中，我们还须进一步发展管柱钻孔法的新技术，这就有待于在理论方面进一步的研究和探讨以及施工方面进一步的试验、摸索和创造发明。因此，我们业已组织了国内许多大专学校、科学研究所和有关制造生产单位进行三十九个桥梁工程技术上的专题研究项目，借以发挥广大群众的无穷智慧并收到集思广益的效果。同时，在桥梁科学技术研究问题上，我们还经常和苏联有关的科学研究机构保持密切的联系，以吸取并学习苏联的先进经验。
    社会主义制度是胜利的源泉和保证
    应当着重指出，我们今天所以能够在我国任何大江巨川上进行“一桥飞架天堑变通途”的伟大建桥任务是和人民民主政权的确立分不开的。在解放以前，我国虽然也曾修过几座国内较为著名的大桥，但是它们不仅为数寥寥无几，而且在效用上和工程质量上都是大有缺陷。更应引为遗憾的是：它们都是由帝国主义包办代替修建的，例如旧的郑州黄河大桥是由法比帝国主义包办代替修建的，济南黄河大桥是由德帝国主义孟阿恩公司包办代替修建的。就是现在我们正在进行修建的珠江大桥也是一度曾经由美帝国主义马克顿公司包办代替开始修建的，但是这座桥不仅没有修建完成，而且就是已经修起的部分工程都是质量很坏，如该桥东桥的六个桥墩只做了五个，沉井均发生偏斜，西桥七个桥墩只做了六个，都没有做到设计标高，全部倾斜。现在，我们在进行修建这座大桥时，虽然费了很大的力气加固利用了东桥的桥墩，但西桥的桥墩就不得不全部予以废弃，另行修筑新墩。这个摆在我们面前的具体事例，以及解放前我国桥梁建设事业停滞不进和被动落后状态，和今天的一日千里、突飞猛进的飞跃发展情况两者之间的鲜明对比，充分说明了：如果国家的政权不掌握在人民的手里——就是工人阶级先锋队共产党的手里，国家是完全不可能进行建设的，国家的建设也是建设不好的。相反的，在人民掌握了政权之后，国家就可突飞猛进地实现一系列前人所万难进行的经天纬地的建设工作，并且就能把这些工作一个一个地彻底搞好。大桥工程局在解放以后近几年来所已经完成的和正在进行的一系列的大桥工程建设的成就，提供着无可争辩的最为有力的论证。
