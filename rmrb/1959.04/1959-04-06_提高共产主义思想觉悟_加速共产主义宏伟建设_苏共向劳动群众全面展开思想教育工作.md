    Enhance Communist Ideological Awareness and Accelerate the Grand Construction of Communism
    The CPSU Comprehensively Launches Ideological Education Work for the Working Masses

    Our Moscow dispatch on the 5th – The political and ideological education work of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) for the broad masses is being deepened and strengthened day by day. The central content of this education work is to widely organize the study of the documents of the 21st CPSU Congress throughout the country, combining theory with practice, focusing on publicizing the Soviet Union's historical achievements, the tasks and significance of the Seven-Year Plan, and the theory of the Soviet Union's transition to communism in the period of comprehensive communist construction and the party's leading role. Through the current mass ideological education work, the communist ideological consciousness of the broad masses throughout the Soviet Union will be further enhanced, so as to better realize the magnificent Seven-Year Plan.

    After the 21st Congress, the ideological work of the CPSU entered a new period. The Party organizations of each union republic, border region, state, and district, in accordance with the instructions of the 21st CPSU Congress on strengthening ideological education work, carried out large-scale work. During this period, party organizations at all levels first strengthened and adjusted the ranks of party propagandists and activists in various localities, and vigorously publicized the various resolutions of the 21st Congress. Afterwards, they dispatched a large number of party cadres to the countryside and factories to specifically organize and lead the ideological education work of the masses. For example, Ukraine successively dispatched thousands of party cadres, and Kazakhstan and Krasnodar Krai also dispatched more than 700 party cadres. They went deep into the grassroots and, together with local party propagandists, organized the masses to carry out political study. At present, the main form of this study is to hold report discussion meetings based on the various issues in the report and resolutions of the 21st Congress. In Belarus, over a month, such report discussion meetings were held more than 10,000 times in rural areas alone, and Abkhazia Autonomous Region of Georgia also held more than 10,000 times. These report discussion meetings, due to the strong leadership of the party and the close integration of theory with practice, had very rich discussion content, and the masses had high enthusiasm for discussion. Generally, they turned from extensive to in-depth, from discussing the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan to discussing specific production increase targets for individuals and groups; from general discussions on the corruption of Western capitalism, to discussing the need to seriously fight against some existing bad ideological remnants. Through such specific ideological education, not only has the ideological understanding of the working masses been improved, but also their enthusiasm for production has been stimulated. For example, Ivanov, an electrical assembler at the Baltic Shipyard in Leningrad, said: "We understand that our factory is not simply producing oil tankers, refrigerated ships, and icebreakers, our factory is the cornerstone of communism, and we workers are precisely the builders of this cornerstone." The production team led by Subov in the factory, with all 18 members, overfulfilled the production plan by 170%-180% every day. And Simina's production team is striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years. Now many industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union have stipulated normal political and ideological study time every month and week, and have increased party political courses in workers' spare-time schools and night schools. Through political and ideological education work, thousands of communist labor teams in factories and collective farms throughout the Soviet Union have been further consolidated and developed, and the mass social supervision force—worker inspection teams and Communist Youth League member sentry posts—have emerged in large numbers everywhere.

    During this period, the propaganda work of newspapers and radio stations, as an important force for the Party to strengthen political and ideological education of the masses, has been done better. Before the 21st CPSU Congress, the central and local newspapers and periodicals of the Soviet Union published many articles discussing the tasks and significance of the Seven-Year Plan from various aspects; after the Congress, this work has been further strengthened. The CPSU Central Committee's "Pravda" continuously published a series of important theoretical articles on communist construction, such as "From Socialism to Communism," "The Establishment of the Material and Technical Base of Communism," and "The Decisive Stage of the Economic Competition between Socialism and Capitalism," written by Soviet Academy of Sciences academicians Fedoseyev, Leontiev, and Ajumanyan. These articles expounded the theoretical and practical issues of communist construction from various angles. Many newspapers and magazines have added special pages on issues such as the Seven-Year Plan, attracting the broad masses to participate in discussions.

    At present, actively publicizing the resolutions of the 21st CPSU Congress has become the responsibility of every party member. Leaders of party, government agencies, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League at all levels have also personally participated in this work. Many grassroots party organizations in Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, and Azerbaijan have deepened the mass political education work to streets and residential buildings.

    In the ideological work carried out by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the present stage, it pays great attention to strengthening the political education of young people.

    In conjunction with educational reforms, schools in various places are further educating students to be close to life and close to production. Many enterprises use holidays to organize young workers to meet with veteran revolutionaries and organize young communist shock workers, etc., to educate young people, which has achieved great results.

    In order to further carry out mass political and ideological education work, the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Turkmenistan have recently successively held meetings to summarize the mass political work in the previous stage, and unanimously believe that political and ideological education work centered on publicizing the documents of the 21st Congress is an important and relatively long-term task of the Party at present, and must be fully completed in accordance with the instructions of the CPSU Central Committee.

    Not long ago, the CPSU Central Committee also adopted a resolution on the situation of the political work of the working masses in the Stalin Oblast and its improvement measures. This resolution is of great significance for further improving mass political work throughout the Soviet Union.

### 提高共产主义思想觉悟　加速共产主义宏伟建设  苏共向劳动群众全面展开思想教育工作

    提高共产主义思想觉悟　加速共产主义宏伟建设
    苏共向劳动群众全面展开思想教育工作
    本报莫斯科5日电　苏联共产党对广大群众进行的政治思想教育工作正在日益深入和加强。这个教育工作的中心内容，是在全国广泛组织结合理论又联系实际地对苏共第二十一次代表大会各项文件的学习，集中宣传苏联历史性成就，宣传七年计划的任务和意义，以及苏联在进入全面建设共产主义时期向共产主义过渡的理论与党的领导作用。通过现阶段的群众性思想教育工作，将进一步提高全苏广大群众的共产主义思想觉悟，来更好地实现雄伟的七年计划。
    在第二十一次代表大会之后苏联共产党的思想工作进入了新的时期。各加盟共和国、边疆区、州和区的党组织，根据苏共第二十一次代表大会关于加强思想教育工作的指示，进行了大规模的工作。这期间，各级党组织首先加强并调整了各地党的宣传员和积极分子队伍，大张旗鼓地宣传二十一次代表大会的各项决议。之后，又派遣了大批党的干部下乡、下厂，具体组织领导群众思想教育工作。如乌克兰先后派出了上千党的干部，哈萨克斯坦和克拉斯诺达尔边疆区也都派出了七百多党的干部。他们深入基层，与地方党的宣传员一起，组织群众进行政治学习。目前这种学习的主要形式是，根据第二十一次代表大会的报告和决议中的各项问题，举行报告讨论会。白俄罗斯一个多月内仅在农村中进行了这样的报告讨论会就达一万多次，格鲁吉亚阿布卡兹州也举行过一万多次。这些报告讨论会由于党的领导强，紧密地理论结合了实际，因此讨论内容非常丰富，群众讨论热情很高。一般的都由广泛转向深入，由谈论七年计划控制数字、发展到讨论个人和小组具体增产指标；由对西方资本主义腐朽的一般讨论，联系到谈论应该严肃地与目前还存在的一些不良思想残余作斗争。经过这样具体的思想教育，不仅提高了劳动群众的思想认识，而且激发了他们的生产积极性。如列宁格勒巴尔蒂工厂电器装配工伊万诺夫说：“我们懂得了我们的工厂不单纯在生产油船、冷藏船、破冰船、我们的工厂是共产主义的基石，而我们工人正是这块奠基石的建造者”。该厂由苏波夫领导的生产小组，全组十八个人，天天超额170％—180％完成生产计划。而西米纳的生产小组争取五年完成七年计划。现在苏联许多工业企业都规定了每月每周的正常政治思想学习时间，并在工人业余学校和夜校中增加党的政治课程。通过政治思想教育工作，全苏各地工厂和农庄里成千上万的共产主义劳动队进一步获得巩固和发展，群众性的社会监督力量——工人纠察队、共青团员岗哨已在各地随之大批涌现出来。
    这期间作为党对群众加强政治思想教育工作中的重要力量——报刊和电台的宣传工作，做得更好了。在苏共第二十一次代表大会之前，苏联中央和地方报刊，登载了许许多多从各个方面讨论七年计划的任务和意义的文章；在代表大会之后这方面工作更有加强。苏共中央的“真理报”连续刊发了一系列重要的共产主义建设理论问题文章，如苏通讯院士费多谢耶夫、列昂节夫、阿朱马尼安等所写的“从社会主义到共产主义”、“共产主义物质技术基础的建立”“社会主义同资本主义经济竞赛的决定性阶段”等文章。这些文章从各个角度阐述了共产主义建设的理论和实践问题。许多报刊杂志增辟了对七年计划等问题的专页，吸引广大群众参加讨论。
    目前积极宣传苏共二十一次代表大会决议，已成为每个党员的责任。各地党、政府机关、工会、共青团的领导人，也都亲自参加了这一工作。列宁格勒、斯维尔德洛夫、阿塞拜疆的许多基层党组织，把群众政治教育工作深入到街道和居民住宅。
    苏联共产党在现阶段展开的思想工作中，非常注意加强对青年的政治教育。
    各地学校结合教育改革，进一步对学生进行着接近生活、接近生产的教育。许多企业利用假日组织青年工人与老革命家会见和组织青年共产主义突击手等等形式教育青年，获得很大成绩。
    为了进一步展开群众性政治思想教育工作，最近阿尔明尼亚、白俄罗斯、格鲁吉亚、哈萨克斯坦、拉脱维亚、立陶宛、爱沙尼亚、土库曼共和国党中央，先后召开了会议总结了前阶段群众政治工作，并一致认为以宣传第二十一次代表大会文件为中心的政治思想教育工作，是目前党的重要任务，也是较为长期的任务，必须遵照苏共中央指示全力完成。
    不久前苏共中央还通过了关于斯大林州劳动群众政治工作状况及其改善措施的决议，这个决议对全苏进一步改进群众政治工作具有着重大意义。
