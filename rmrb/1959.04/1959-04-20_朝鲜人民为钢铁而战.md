　　Korean People Fight for Steel
　　By Our Correspondent　Wang Yuzhang
    “Steel and machinery are the kings of industry,” this is the slogan put forward on the industrial front in 1959, the second year of Korea striding forward on the "Chollima". To produce more than twice as much steel as last year, the Korean people are launching a magnificent battle. Recently, the restored and newly built blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and converters have been put into production one after another. In the first quarter of this year, Korea's pig iron production increased two to three times compared with the same period last year, and steel increased by 33%. They are determined to strive to produce 1.12 million tons of iron and 880,000 tons of steel this year. If this plan is completed, Korea's steel production per capita will exceed that of Japan.
    In the resolution of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party at its September plenary session last year, it was pointed out: "To realize socialist industrialization and carry out technical transformation in all sectors of the national economy, the development of the metallurgical industry, especially the steel industry, occupies an extremely important position. Without steel, it is impossible to produce machinery and equipment, to strengthen the technical equipment of the national economy, and to carry out capital construction." The resolution emphasized: Rapidly developing the steel industry is the most urgent task facing the Korean people. To accomplish this task, the Workers' Party called on the entire party and all the people to concentrate their efforts on fighting for increased steel production.
    Under this great call, the steelworkers took the lead and launched a competition to increase steel production. They improved equipment utilization, promoted advanced technologies and operating methods, implemented mechanization and automation, and did everything possible to increase steel production.
    When I recently visited the Kangson Steel Works in the western suburbs of Pyongyang, I saw a moving scene of workers fighting to increase steel production. This steel plant is a medium-sized plant, but the workers' ambition and drive are very high. They want to produce 330,000 tons of steel this year, making steel and steel product output three times that of last year. The "Chollima" operating team on Electric Furnace No. 3 adopted rationalization proposals put forward by workers in the first quarter of this year, and has already reduced the time for smelting a furnace of steel from about ten hours last year to about seven and a half hours. Other furnaces and teams are learning from the "Chollima" operating team and are catching up. They are striving to reduce the time for each furnace of steel to six and a half hours. In the rolling mill, the workers automated two sets of rolling mills at the beginning of this year, and another set is being modified. Workers installed an anti-circumferential disc on the wire rolling mill, and 20 cm steel like a fire snake, automatically passed through four rolling mills as if flying, was rolled into 8 cm wire, and automatically coiled into a coil. After automation, the output increased sevenfold. Last year, the daily output was 30 tons, but now it has increased to 200 tons, while the number of workers has been reduced by half.
    At the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works, although the two blast furnaces have just been restored and undergone major repairs, the struggle to reduce the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace has achieved remarkable results. Blast Furnace No. 1 was put into production in late March, and reached a level of 612 tons per day on the thirteenth day. The workers want to reach 800 tons per day before May Day and reduce the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace to 0.6 in the second quarter. The five open-hearth furnaces of the Hwanghae Iron Works also created a new record of 1,000 tons per day in the first quarter.
    Korea's steel industry suffered serious damage during the war. Good steel plants were turned into piles of scrap iron. In the five years after the war, through the arduous efforts of the Korean people, steel giants stood up one by one. By the end of last year, three blast furnaces and many steelmaking and rolling equipment had been restored. Last year, 320,000 tons of pig iron and 365,000 tons of steel were produced.
    In order to rapidly increase steel production, the capital construction tasks of the steel sector this year are twice as large as last year. All five steel plants in northern Korea are undergoing large-scale expansion. Among them, there is the restoration project of the No. 2 blast furnace and the new construction project of the No. 2 coking furnace in the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Works, and there are three converter steelmaking workshops with a total annual production capacity of more than 600,000 tons, which are being built in three plants respectively, as well as open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, and various rolling mills. The restoration and completion of these facilities will make Korea's steel production grow rapidly in the next one or two years.
    It is naturally very difficult to carry out so many construction projects in one year. But the Korean people have taken on this heavy burden with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. Korea's machinery factories and steel plants themselves undertake the manufacturing task of 20,000 tons of equipment required for these projects, including complete sets of blast furnaces and coking furnaces, as well as rolling equipment. From September last year to the beginning of this year, more than 12,000 young people poured into the steel sector to support this construction task.
    Walking to the construction site of the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Works, a magnificent picture of workers and students working together to carry out construction unfolds before people's eyes.
    On the construction site of Blast Furnace No. 2, workers have completely removed the furnace body of the blast furnace, which was riddled with holes by bombing during the war. Now, the square in front of the blast furnace foundation is piled with iron plates and blast furnace equipment of various shapes. The workers are welding and riveting, and they want to rebuild the blast furnace before "August 15th". After the expansion, the output of this fourth blast furnace restored by the Korean people after the war will be doubled compared with the Japanese rule period. Kim Hyong-sam, the chief engineer of the factory, told reporters: After the No. 3 blast furnace is restored next year, the factory will have the capacity to produce one million tons of iron per year.
    On the construction site of the thick plate and thin plate rolling mill of this factory, students from Haeju Normal University wearing blue work clothes are digging the foundation of the thick plate rolling mill. Regardless of the mud splashing all over their bodies and faces, the men dig, and the women carry, working very hard. The students' enthusiasm for building the motherland is enough to melt even steel.
    The Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works is also undergoing a huge construction project. This factory will be built into Korea's largest steel enterprise with an annual output of 2.5 million tons of iron in the next four or five years. Based on Korea's characteristics of abundant electricity and shortage of coking coal, Korea is building an electric ironmaking plant with an annual output of 500,000 tons each in Kangson Steel Works and Hungnam, which can be completed by 1961.
    In order to mobilize multiple potentials and increase steel production. On the steel front in Korea, while building large-scale factories, local factories are also being built. While using modern technology, handicraft technology is also being used.
    Now many places in northern Korea have built small blast furnaces for iron smelting. The small blast furnaces built in Songrim City and Kaesong City last year have been producing well. Now Kaesong City is building three more small blast furnaces. Many factories have also built small blast furnaces and cupolas, striving for self-sufficiency in pig iron.
    In the Pyongyang Food Machinery Manufacturing Plant, workers also used simple machines to produce seamless steel pipes for the first time in Korea. On the day the reporter visited the factory, it was raining. The machines for producing seamless steel pipes were installed in an open space, and the factory building had not yet been built. The workers were producing a batch of 60 cm to 70 cm seamless steel pipes in the open air despite the rain. The factory has already supplied 30 tons of seamless steel pipes to the Chongjin Steel Plant, and is now rushing to produce a batch of seamless steel pipes for two artificial fiber plants in Chongjin and Sinuiju. At present, workshops for producing such seamless steel pipes are also being built in Kangson and other places. In this way, the potential in all aspects has been tapped, and Korea's steel production is developing at a faster rate.

　　朝鲜人民为钢铁而战
　　本报记者　王玉章
    “钢铁和机械是工业之王”，这是朝鲜跨上“千里马”的第二年——1959年在工业战线上提出的口号。朝鲜人民为了在今年生产比去年多一倍还多的钢铁，正在展开一场规模壮阔的大战。最近，恢复和新建起来的高炉、平炉、转炉，一座一座地投入生产。今年第一季度，朝鲜的生铁产量比去年同期增长了两三倍，钢增加了33％。他们决心争取在今年生产出一百一十二万吨铁、八十八万吨钢。完成了这个计划，朝鲜的钢铁产量按人口平均计算将超过日本。
    朝鲜劳动党中央在去年9月全会的决议中曾指出：“要实现社会主义工业化，并在人民经济各部门进行技术改造，发展冶金工业特别是钢铁工业就占有极其重要的地位。没有钢材就不能生产机械设备，不能加强人民经济的技术装备，不能进行基本建设。”决议强调：迅速发展钢铁工业是摆在朝鲜人民面前的最迫切的任务。为了完成这个任务，劳动党号召全党全民集中力量为增产钢铁而战。
    在这个伟大的号召下，钢铁工人一马当先，展开了增产钢铁的竞赛。他们提高设备利用率，推广先进技术和作业法，实行机械化和自动化，千方百计地增产钢铁。  
    记者最近访问平壤西郊降仙炼钢厂时，看到工人们为增产钢铁而斗争的动人情景。这个炼钢厂是个中型厂，但工人们的雄心和干劲却大得很，他们今年要生产三十三万吨钢，使钢和钢材的产量达到去年的三倍。三号电炉上的“千里马”作业班在今年第一季度内采纳了工人提出的合理化建议，已经把炼一炉钢的时间由去年的十小时左右缩短到七小时半左右。其他各炉各班都在向“千里马”作业班看齐，并且迎头赶上去。他们正在争取使电炉每出一炉钢的时间缩短到六小时半。在轧钢车间里，工人们今年年初把两套压延机自动化了，另一套正在进行改装。工人在线材压延机上装上反围盘，二十糎的钢材像一条火蛇，像飞一般地自动穿过四座压延机，被轧成了八糎的线材，而且自动地盘成了盘。自动化以后产量陡增了七倍，去年日产三十吨，现在增加到二百吨，工人却减少了一半。
    在金策制铁所，二座高炉虽然刚刚恢复和进行了大补修，但降低高炉利用系数的斗争已取得了显著的成就。第一号高炉3月下旬投入生产，第十三天就达到日产六百一十二吨的水平。工人们要在“五一”节前使它达到日产八百吨，在第二季度内使高炉利用系数降低到零点六。黄海制铁所的五座平炉在第一季度也创造了日产一千吨的新纪录。
    朝鲜的钢铁工业在战时曾经遭到严重的破坏。大好的钢铁厂都变成了破铁堆。战后五年来，经过朝鲜人民的艰苦努力，一个一个的钢铁巨人站起来了。到去年年底，已经恢复了三座高炉和许多炼钢、轧钢设备。去年生产了三十二万吨生铁和三十六万五千吨钢。
    为了迅速地增产钢铁，今年钢铁部门的基本建设任务比去年大了一倍。朝鲜北部所有的五个钢铁厂都在进行着大规模扩建。其中，有黄海制铁所的第二号高炉的恢复工程和第二号炼焦炉的新建工程，有分别建设在三个厂的总年产能力六十多万吨的三个转炉炼钢车间，另外还有平炉、电炉、各种轧钢车间等。这些设备的恢复和建成，将使朝鲜的钢铁生产在今后一、二年内飞跃增长。
    在一年内进行这样多的建设工程，自然是十分艰巨的。但朝鲜人民以冲天的革命干劲，担起了这副重担。朝鲜的各机械厂和钢铁厂自己担当起这些工程所需的两万吨设备的制造任务，其中包括整套的高炉和炼焦炉以及轧钢设备等。从去年9月到今年年初，有一万二千多名青年涌入钢铁部门，支援这一项建设任务。
    走到黄海制铁所的建设工地上，一幅工人、学生齐心努力进行建设的壮丽图景展现在人们眼前。
    在二号高炉的工地上，工人们已把战时被炸得百孔千疮的高炉炉体完全拆走了。现在，高炉基础面前的广场上，堆满了铁板和各种形状的高炉设备，工人们正焊的焊、铆的铆，要在“八·一五”以前把高炉重建起来。经过扩建以后，这座战后朝鲜人民恢复起来的第四座高炉的产量将比日本统治时期增加一倍。这个厂的总工程师金衡三对记者说：明年第三号高炉恢复后，这个厂就具有年产一百万吨铁的能力了。
    在这个厂的厚板、薄板压延车间建设工地上，穿着蓝色劳动服的海州师范大学的学生们正在挖厚板压延机的基础。他们不顾泥浆溅得满身满脸，男的挖，女的背，干得十分起劲。学生们建设祖国的热情，就是钢铁也要被熔化的。
    金策制铁所也正在进行庞大的建设工程。这个厂在今后四、五年内要建成年产二百五十万吨铁的朝鲜最大的钢铁企业。根据朝鲜电力丰富、炼焦煤缺少的特点，朝鲜正在降仙炼钢厂和兴南各建一座年产五十万吨的电气炼铁厂，到1961年就可以建成。
    为了动员多方面的潜力，增产钢铁。朝鲜在钢铁战线上，在建设大规模的工厂的同时，也建设地方工厂。在利用现代化技术的同时，也利用手工业技术。
    现在朝鲜北部有许多地方兴建了炼铁的小高炉，松林市和开城市去年建成的小高炉一直生产得很好。现在开城市又在修建三座小高炉。许多工厂也修建了小高炉和化铁炉，争取自给生铁。
    在平壤食品机械制造所，工人们还用简单的机器在朝鲜第一次造出了无缝钢管。记者去访问这个工厂的那天，正下着雨，生产无缝钢管的机器安设在一片空地上，厂房还没有盖起来，工人们就冒着雨在露天里生产着一批六十糎到七十糎的无缝钢管。这个厂已经供应了清津炼钢厂三十吨无缝钢管，现在正在为清津和新义州两个人造纤维厂赶制一批无缝钢管。目前，在降仙等地方也在开始建设这样的生产无缝钢管的车间。这样，多方面的潜力都挖掘出来了，朝鲜的钢铁生产正以更快的速度发展着。
