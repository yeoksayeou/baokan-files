　　Promote Balanced Development of All Types of Production Teams
    Hengyang Prefecture Draws a Large Number of Cadres to Production Teams with Weak Work
    Shihe Brigade of Jiekou Commune in Conghua County, Guangdong Province, Vows to Work Hard for a Year to Catch Up with Advanced Teams
    Changsha, April 15th (This newspaper dispatch) - In order to achieve balanced development and synchronized leaps forward in the production of all types of production teams, and to first win the battle of spring plowing production and strive for a greater harvest this year, the Hengyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province recently drew more than 11,400 cadres from various counties, communes, and brigades to go deep into teams with weak economic foundations, backward teams, remote teams, and large-scale production teams to strengthen the leadership of these teams.
    This year, spring plowing production in the Hengyang area has made great leaps forward in all aspects compared with last year, but there are still 35% of the teams (according to statistics from six counties) lagging behind the advanced teams. There are many reasons for being relatively backward: either due to poor material conditions, or due to a poor work foundation, or due to the remoteness of the area, which is not convenient for leadership, and there are fewer cadres, or due to the large size of the team, the large scope, and the work is more繁重, and the cadres cannot handle it. Therefore, there is an urgent need to send key personnel to these teams to enrich the strength and strengthen the leadership, so that we can comprehensively fight the battle of spring plowing production in the whole region and realize this year's continued great leap forward.
    All the cadres in the Hengyang area recently seriously discussed the decision of the Prefectural Committee on strengthening the grassroots and strengthening the leadership of the four types of teams, and unanimously believed that this decision is of great significance for promoting the high tide of agricultural production this year and further consolidating the People's Commune. Cadres at the county, commune, and brigade levels warmly responded to the call of the Prefectural Committee and actively signed up to request to be transferred downwards. Many cadres also put forward resounding slogans: "Go to the most remote, most difficult, and most needed places! We will not come back until we change the face of these areas!" The Party Committee of Jingtouxu Commune in Dong'an decided to send Deputy Director Feng Zhiyun to a team with a weak economic foundation that has suffered from drought for three consecutive years. He said: "We are not afraid of lagging behind in our work. As long as we work hard, things can be done, and we can catch up with the advanced." He also made three guarantees to the Party Committee: First, go deep into the masses and resolutely eat, live, and work with the masses; second, go deep into production and discover and solve various key problems in production; and third, definitely change the face of this production team in a short period of time.
    After this group of cadres went down, they generally ate, lived, and worked with the masses, consulted with the masses when there was something to do, and overcame difficulties with the masses, thus further inspiring the confidence of cadres and the masses and solving many problems. The Damaoping Brigade of Xiamadu Commune in Qiyang, which has a weak economic foundation, needed 30,000 jin of lime in the spring plowing, but could not buy it back due to lack of funds. After Shi Youde, a member of the Commune Party Committee, arrived at this brigade, in addition to borrowing money from the commune to buy back lime, he also studied with the masses and made two fishing boats to fish for fry, and soon recovered more than 1,100 yuan, which, in addition to repaying the loan, could also solve part of the wage problem. The Jianlou Production Team (remote team) of Yingpo Commune in Hengyang originally had few cadres, the backbone strength was not strong, and the production progress was slow. After Commune cadres Hong Xiaogao and Hu Derong became the captain and deputy captain of this team, they held a forum for basic masses, and immediately took off their shoes and socks to work in the fields, driving the broad masses of commune members, and plowed 160 mu of land in only four days, eliminating the hardened fields. The fertilizer was also rapidly increased from 200 dan per mu to 400 dan.

    Guangzhou, April 15th (This newspaper dispatch) - Shihe Production Brigade of Jiekou People's Commune in Conghua County, Guangdong Province, which originally had a relatively poor production base, recently analyzed the reasons for its past "backwardness", promoted positive factors, formulated a practical production plan in light of local conditions, and proposed a production competition initiative to the advanced team, Xiongfeng Brigade, in the commune. They are determined to work hard for a year under the unified leadership of the commune and catch up with "Xiongfeng." Now, this production brigade, which used to transplant rice seedlings until "Lixia" (the beginning of summer), has basically completed the transplanting seven days after "Qingming" (Tomb Sweeping Day), catching up with the progress of "Xiongfeng"; diversified operations have also been initially developed.
    Shihe Production Brigade is located in a hilly area, with high terrain in the northwest and low terrain in the southeast. In the past, either the highlands were drought-stricken or the lowlands were flooded. Before 1957, 450 mu of the brigade's more than 2,100 mu of cultivated land were often drought-stricken, and 740 mu were flooded, and production was not very stable. Therefore, in the past, commune members generally believed that their conditions were not as good as others, and coupled with the large amount of land and the lack of labor, they lacked confidence in catching up with the advanced, so the production level has always been in a "backward" state.
    In this recent rectification campaign, after full discussion, this brigade affirmed that although its natural conditions were relatively bad, the main reason for its past "backwardness" was that cadres and commune members were bound by the "theory of conditions only," and did not give full play to their subjective initiative and actively promote various technological reforms. For example, last year, the early rice was not transplanted until after "Lixia," which was delayed for more than 40 days, and it was still transplanted in sizes of 7×8 inches or 8×9 inches, and the fertilizer was only 40 or 50 dan per mu, so the yield was relatively low. Now, thanks to the commune's construction of the Longtan Reservoir and the Baxiang water conservancy project, plus the brigade's own construction of four mountain ponds and two drainage canals, drought and flood disasters have been basically eliminated. In terms of natural conditions, although this is a hilly area and the soil conditions are not as good as the plains, it is unparalleled in the plains in terms of developing forests, fruits, and diversified operations.
    After this analysis, the commune members were ambitious and practically formulated a production plan of "adapting to local conditions, working hard for a year, and catching up with the advanced," and proposed a competition initiative to the advanced team in the commune - Xiongfeng Brigade.
    In order to ensure the realization of the plan, all 23 cadres of the Shihe Brigade are now participating in production and leading production in the posture of both commanders and combatants; at the same time, the brigade has implemented a labor management system of assigning tasks to teams, setting quotas to people, and paying according to work, and has launched competitions between teams, groups, and people. The Commune Party Committee also dispatched a secretary to reside in this brigade to strengthen leadership. As of the 12th, in just over ten days, the brigade had basically completed the transplanting of 1,400 mu of early rice, catching up with the progress of the advanced teams. Now, this team has shifted its main strength to field management, vigorously grasping mid-tillage and topdressing, so that every hill has drainage and irrigation rulers, and shallow irrigation and fine weeding are carried out.

### 促使各类生产队平衡发展  衡阳专区抽调大批干部到工作薄弱的生产队去  广东从化县街口公社石合大队立志大干一年赶上先进队

　　促使各类生产队平衡发展
    衡阳专区抽调大批干部到工作薄弱的生产队去
    广东从化县街口公社石合大队立志大干一年赶上先进队
    本报长沙15日电　为了使各种不同类型生产队的生产平衡发展，齐步跃进，并首先打好春耕生产这一仗，力争今年获得更大的丰收，中共湖南衡阳地委最近从各县、公社和大队里抽调了一万一千四百多名干部，深入到经济基础薄弱的队、后进队、边远队和规模较大的生产队去，加强这些队的领导。
    衡阳地区今年春耕生产各方面都较去年大大跃进了一步，但是目前还有占35％（据六个县的统计）的队落在先进队的后面。比较后进的原因很多：或者由于物质条件较差，或者由于工作基础较差，或者由于地区偏僻，不便于领导，干部力量也较少，或者由于队大、范围大，工作比较繁重，干部抓不过来。因此，迫切需要加派骨干到这些队去，充实力量，加强领导，这样，才能在全区范围内全面地打好春耕生产这一仗，实现今年的继续大跃进。
    衡阳地区全体干部最近认真讨论了地委关于加强基层、加强对四种队的领导的决定，一致认为这一决定对于促进今年农业生产高潮、进一步巩固人民公社，关系十分重大。县、公社、大队各级干部热烈响应了地委号召，纷纷报名要求下放。许多干部还提出响亮的口号：“到最偏僻、最困难、最需要的地方去！不改变这些地区的面貌不回来！”东安井头墟公社党委决定副社长冯志云到一个连续三年遭干旱的经济基础薄弱的队去。他说：“不怕工作落后，只要发奋努力，事在人为，就能赶上先进。”他并向党委提出三项保证：一、深入群众，坚决和群众同吃同住同劳动；二、深入生产，发现和解决生产中的各种关键问题；三、一定在短期内改变这个生产队的面貌。
    这批干部下去以后，普遍做到了与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，有事和群众商量，有困难和群众共同克服，因而进一步鼓舞了干部和群众的信心，解决了许多问题。祁阳下马渡公社经济基础薄弱的大茅坪大队，在春耕中需要三万斤石灰，但因缺乏资金，无法买回来。公社党委委员石友德到这个大队以后，除了向公社借钱买回石灰以外，还和群众一起研究，做了两只渔舫捞鱼苗，很快就收回一千一百多元，除归还借款以外，还可解决一部分工资问题。衡阳英陂公社建楼生产队（边远队）原来干部少，骨干力量不强，生产进度较慢，公社干部宏效高、胡德荣到这个队担任正、副队长以后，召开了基本群众的座谈会，并且立即脱鞋袜下田，带动了广大社员，只四天就犁田一百六十亩，消灭了板田。肥料也由每亩二百担迅速增到四百担。
    本报广州15日电　原来生产基础比较差的广东省从化县街口人民公社石合生产大队，最近分析了过去“落后”的原因，发扬了积极的因素，因地制宜地订出了切实可行的生产规划，向公社里的先进队雄峰大队提出生产竞赛的倡议。他们决心在公社统一领导下，发奋图强，大干一年，赶上“雄峰”。现在，这个去年插秧插到“立夏”的生产大队已在“清明”后七天基本插完秧，赶上“雄峰”的进度；多种经营也初步发展起来。
    石合生产大队位于丘陵地区，地势西北高、东南低，向来不是高地受旱，便是低地受涝。1957年以前，全大队二千一百多亩耕地经常受旱的有四百五十亩，受涝的有七百四十亩，生产不很稳定。因此，过去社员普遍认为自己的条件不如别人，加上土地多，劳力少，对赶上先进缺乏信心，因而生产水平一直处于“落后”的状态。
    在最近这次整社运动中，这个大队经过充分的讨论，肯定自己的自然条件虽然比较坏，但过去“落后”的原因，主要是干部和社员受“唯条件论”的束缚，没有充分发挥主观能动性，没有积极推行各项技术改革。如去年早稻到“立夏”后才插完，拖了四十多天，而且还是插7×8寸或8×9寸的规格，肥料每亩也只有四、五十担，因此产量就比较低。而现在，由于公社修建了龙潭水库和八乡水利工程，加上大队自己建了四个山塘和两条排水渠，旱涝灾害已基本消除。在自然条件方面，这里虽然是丘陵地区，土壤条件不如平原好，但在发展林木、水果和多种经营方面，却是平原比不上的。
    经过这样分析后，社员们雄心勃勃，又切切实实地订出了一个“因地制宜，大干一年，赶上先进”的生产规划，并向公社里的先进队——雄峰大队提出了竞赛倡议。
    为了保证规划的实现，现在石合大队全队二十三名干部个个都以既是指挥员又是战斗员的姿态，参加生产领导生产；同时，全大队贯彻了任务到组、定额到人、按工计酬的劳动管理制度，并展开了队与队、组与组、人与人之间的竞赛。公社党委还抽调了一名书记长驻这个大队，加强领导。到12日止，仅仅十多天，全队一千四百亩早稻便基本上插完，赶上了先进队的进度。现在，这个队已把主要力量转上田间管理，大抓中耕追肥，做到丘丘有排灌尺，浅灌细耘。
