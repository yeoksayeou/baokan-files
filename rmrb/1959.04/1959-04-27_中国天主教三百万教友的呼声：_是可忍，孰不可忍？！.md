The cry of three million Chinese Catholic believers:
Is this tolerable, what is not?!
Pi Shushi, Dong Wenlong, Yang Shida, Wang Wencheng, and Zhang Jiashu said in a joint statement:
Chinese Catholic believers resolutely oppose the despicable behavior of imperialists, the Vatican, and Indian expansionists in using religion and the Tibetan rebellion to interfere in our internal affairs! Indian expansionists have become dizzy with ambition, clamoring wildly, and even insulting our people's leaders. This is tolerable, what is not!
Chairman, fellow committee members:
We fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, and the various reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.
Nearly two years have passed since the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In these two years, whether from a global or Chinese perspective, there has been a great turning point.
Globally, the general trend is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. Imperialism is rotting away day by day due to the impact of the increasingly severe economic crisis and the vigorous development of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; while the socialist world is achieving production leaps, rising prestige, and unprecedented unity, getting better day by day. This situation has greatly encouraged all peace-loving and freedom-seeking people around the world.
In China, 1958 was the most decisive and glorious year in the history of our Chinese nation. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the victory of the nationwide rectification campaign, the heroic struggle and creative labor of more than 600 million people, and the rich experience and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, our socialist construction has achieved splendid and brilliant victories on all fronts, presenting a prosperous and encouraging scene.
China's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958 laid the foundation for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. Facts have proved that the socialist road is the only road that can lead China to prosperity and strength, and is the only bright road that leads more than 600 million Chinese people (including our three million Catholic believers) to a free and happy life. History proves that only the Communist Party can lead us on the socialist road, because only it truly loves the people and serves the people wholeheartedly. How can we not support such a good social system and such good leadership! Therefore, the vast majority of clergy and believers wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Communist Party and resolutely take the socialist road.
However, the Vatican has always served colonialism, opposed socialism, and adopted a hostile attitude towards New China. It has done everything possible to undermine and obstruct Chinese Catholic clergy and believers from supporting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and taking the socialist road. Facts over the years have proved that the Vatican not only used Chinese Catholicism to serve colonialism for a long time before our liberation, but also tried to continue to use Chinese Catholicism as a tool for imperialism to oppose our socialist cause after liberation.
There are many examples of the Vatican colluding with imperialists and using religion to carry out aggression against our country. To name a few important ones: After the September 18th Incident in 1931, when Japanese imperialism occupied our Northeast and created the puppet state of Manchuria, the Vatican was the first to recognize it, appointing the French imperialist element Gao Dehui as the Vatican's representative to the puppet state of Manchuria, and issuing "proclamations" and "orders" requiring Catholic believers to support the puppet state of Manchuria, pray for the puppet state of Manchuria, and support the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
In July 1937, when Japanese imperialism launched a war of aggression against China, during the years when the Chinese people were engaged in a heroic resistance, the Vatican instructed Catholic missionaries in China to support Japanese actions, requiring bishops and priests in various Chinese dioceses to practice Sino-Japanese friendship and help Japanese imperialism consolidate its rule in the occupied areas.
In December 1946, the Vatican sent Liberi as "Envoy to China" to assist Chiang Kai-shek in launching a civil war. After arriving in Nanjing, Liberi called on Chinese Catholic believers to concentrate their efforts to maintain close ties with the Kuomintang government. He personally flew to Northeast and North China on American military planes to help Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people war.
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Liberi was expelled from China by the Chinese people for continuing to engage in espionage and sabotage activities, plotting to establish the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," and attempting to subvert our People's Republic of China. The Vatican still sent him to Taiwan as "Envoy" to the Chiang Kai-shek clique to continue carrying out activities to undermine New China.
Not only that, the Vatican also used religion to instruct imperialist elements and counter-revolutionaries hiding within the Chinese Catholic Church to carry out various sabotage activities. It constantly used "encyclicals" and "orders" to incite Chinese Catholic believers to oppose the Chinese Communist Party, oppose the People's Government, and undermine the socialist construction cause. It forbade believers from participating in any organization under the leadership of the Communist Party, and forced believers to "shed blood and sacrifice their lives" to realize its reactionary political conspiracies. It even used so-called "apostasy" and "schism" as well as means such as "depriving of sacred power," "suspending of sacred duties," and "excommunication" to threaten and attack patriotic clergy and believers. Recently, echoing Dulles, it has fabricated rumors and slanders against our people's communes and the 1958 nationwide Great Leap Forward.
In addition, the Vatican twice unreasonably denied the legitimacy of Zhang Shilang (member of the National Committee of the CPPCC), the acting bishop of the Shanghai Diocese, in March and July 1957. In March 1958, it also denied the legitimate election of bishops in the Hankou and Wuchang dioceses, and used "super excommunication" to intimidate, attempting to keep these dioceses in a state of chaos for a long time in order to continue its conspiracy to use the Chinese Catholic Church to carry out anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities.
After the recent Tibetan rebellion, it followed the US imperialism and issued shameless slanders. US imperialism described our government's just measures to suppress national traitors, national sinners, and religious scum as "destroying religion"; the US imperialist echo—the Vatican—also described our government's pacification of the Tibetan rebellion as "the human nature of people whose basic rights have been harmed." And the Indian expansionists, who inherited the mantle of British imperialism, even attempted to use the Tibetan rebellion to realize their expansionist ambitions, placing our sacred territory of Tibet under Indian control and dragging the Tibetan people into deep water again. This is a delusional and arrogant idea. Recently, Indian expansionists have regarded our people's strict adherence to the "Five Principles" and sincere attitude of good neighborliness as weakness that can be bullied. They have become even more dizzy with ambition, ignoring the condemnation and opposition of the Chinese people and the fair world opinion, intensifying their frenzy, and wantonly slandering and vilifying our country, even organizing "demonstrations" to insult the image of our people's leader Chairman Mao. This is tolerable, what is not!
We solemnly warn the Indian expansionists that China's sacred unity will never allow anyone to undermine it under any pretext. Trying to gain some "advantage" on the Tibet issue is absolutely impossible. Tibet is an inseparable part of China, and any conspiracy that dares to invade Tibet will surely be smashed to pieces by the united iron fist of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.
China's three million Catholic believers resolutely support the government's wise measures to order the dissolution of the Tibetan local government that plotted the rebellion and to quell the rebellion, and resolutely oppose the British imperialism, the Vatican, and the Indian expansionists' vicious means of using religion and the Tibetan rebellion to interfere in our internal affairs. We cheer for the great victory achieved by the heroic People's Liberation Army in quelling the Tibetan rebellion, and we rejoice for the further consolidation of the motherland's unity and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.
The various conspiracies and sabotage activities of the Vatican in using religion to serve imperialism and colonialism not only cannot deceive us awakened Chinese Catholic believers and shake our anti-imperialist and patriotic stance, but also make us sharpen our eyes, strengthen our fighting spirit, and further recognize the reactionary nature of the Vatican, recognize that the relationship between Chinese Catholicism and the Vatican is a matter of two fundamentally opposed political stances; we also see more clearly that, in order to safeguard the independence and dignity of the motherland and the interests of more than 600 million people, and in order to safeguard the interests of Chinese Catholicism and three million believers, the Chinese Catholic Church must continue to deeply develop the anti-imperialist and patriotic movement, completely get rid of all control by the Vatican, and resolutely and thoroughly realize the task of independently running the church.
We, the three million Chinese Catholic believers, are determined to contribute all our strength, together with the people of the whole country, to complete and overfulfill the magnificent leap forward plan for 1959, to build our country into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern socialist science and culture in fifteen to twenty years or more. We believe that our socialist construction cause, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, and with the close unity and joint efforts of the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life across the country, will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements.

### 中国天主教三百万教友的呼声：  是可忍，孰不可忍？！

    中国天主教三百万教友的呼声：
    是可忍，孰不可忍？！
    皮漱石　董文隆　杨士达　王文成　张家树委员在联合发言中说：
    中国天主教教友坚决反对帝国主义、罗马教廷和印度扩张主义分子利用宗教和西藏叛乱事件干涉我国内政的卑鄙行为！印度扩张主义分子热昏了头脑，疯狂叫嚣，甚至侮辱我人民领袖，是可忍，孰不可忍！主席、各位委员：
    我们完全同意并衷心拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席所作的各项报告。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第二届第三次会议到现在将近二年了。二年来，无论就世界说，或者就中国说，都是一个伟大的转折。
    就世界说，总的趋势是东风压倒了西风。帝国主义由于日益加剧的经济危机的冲击和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，正在一天天烂下去；而社会主义世界则是生产跃进、威望日高、空前团结，一天天好起来。这种形势大大鼓励了全世界一切爱好和平、争取自由的人们。
    就中国来说，一九五八年是我们中华民族历史上最有决定性和最光荣的一年。我国社会主义建设事业，由于以毛主席为首的党中央的英明领导，由于总路线的光辉照耀，由于全民整风运动的胜利，由于六亿多人民的英勇奋斗和创造性的劳动，由于苏联和各兄弟国家的丰富经验和无私的援助，在各个战线上都取得了灿烂辉煌的胜利，出现了一片繁荣昌盛、令人欢欣鼓舞的景象。
    我国一九五八年的工农业大跃进，给一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进奠定了基础。事实证明，社会主义道路是唯一能使中国走向繁荣、富强的道路，是使六亿多中国人民（包括我们三百万天主教友）走向自由幸福生活的唯一的光明大道。历史证明只有共产党才能领导我们走社会主义道路。因为只有它是真正爱人民的，是全心全意为人民服务的。这样好的社会制度，这样好的领导，我们怎么能不拥护呢！因此，广大的神职人员和教友，莫不衷心拥护共产党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路。
    但是，罗马教廷一贯为殖民主义者服务，反对社会主义，采取敌视新中国的态度。它多方破坏和阻挠中国天主教神职人员和教友拥护中国共产党的领导走社会主义道路。多年来的事实证明，罗马教廷不仅在我国解放前长期利用中国天主教为殖民主义者服务，而且在解放后仍然力图继续利用中国天主教作为帝国主义反对我国社会主义事业的工具。
    罗马教廷与帝国主义者勾结利用宗教对我国进行侵略的事例很多。举其要者，如：一九三一年九一八事变，日本帝国主义侵占我东北，制造了伪满洲国后，罗马教廷首先予以承认，委派了法帝国主义分子高德惠，为教廷驻伪满洲国代表，并发出“布告”、“命令”，要天主教友拥护伪满洲国，为伪满洲国祈祷，拥护大东亚共荣圈。
    一九三七年七月，日本帝国主义发动对中国的侵略战争，当着中国人民进行英勇抗战的岁月里，罗马教廷却指示在中国的天主教传教士支持日本行动，要中国各教区主教、神甫，实行中日亲善，帮助日本帝国主义巩固它在占领地区的统治。
    一九四六年十二月，罗马教廷派黎培里为“驻华公使”，协助蒋介石发动内战。黎培里到南京后，就号召中国天主教友要集中力量与国民党政府密切联系。并乘美国军用专机亲自到东北、华北等地，帮助蒋介石的反人民战争。
    一九四九年，中华人民共和国成立以后，黎培里因继续进行间谍破坏活动，策划建立反动组织“圣母军”，企图颠复我中华人民共和国等罪行，被中国人民驱逐出境，罗马教廷仍派他到台湾去作驻蒋介石集团的“公使”，继续进行破坏新中国的活动。
    不仅如此，罗马教廷还利用宗教指使暗藏在中国天主教会内的帝国主义分子和反革命分子进行各种破坏活动。不断地以“通论”、“命令”来煽动中国天主教友反对中国共产党，反对人民政府，破坏社会主义建设事业。不准教友参加共产党领导下的任何组织，强令教友为实现它的反动政治阴谋“流血致命”。甚至以所谓“叛教”、“裂教”的罪名，和“摘神权”、“停神功”、“弃绝”（开除教籍）等手段来威胁打击爱国的神职人员和教友。近来并与杜勒斯相呼应，对我国人民公社和一九五八年全民全面大跃进，进行造谣诬蔑。
    此外，罗马教廷于一九五七年三月和七月两次无理否认了上海教区合法代理主教张士琅（全国政协委员）。又于一九五八年三月否认了汉口、武昌两教区的主教合法选举，并以“超级绝罚”施行恫吓，企图使这些教区长期处于混乱状态，以实现它继续利用中国天主教会进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋。
    最近西藏叛乱事件发生后，仍复追随美帝国主义，发表无耻谰言。美帝国主义把我国政府讨伐国家叛徒、民族罪人、宗教败类的正义措施，说成是“摧毁宗教”；美帝国主义的应声虫——罗马教廷也把我国政府平息西藏叛乱说成是“基本权利受到损害的人类的天性”。而继承英帝国主义衣钵的印度扩张主义分子，竟企图利用西藏叛乱事件，实行其扩张野心，把我国神圣领土西藏，置于印度的控制之下，把西藏人民再拖入水深火热之中，这是痴人作梦的狂妄想法。最近以来，印度扩张主义分子把我国人民严格遵守“五项原则”、睦邻友好的诚挚态度，认为是软弱可欺。他们更热昏了头脑，不顾中国人民和全世界公正舆论的谴责和反对，变本加厉的疯狂叫嚣，对我国百般诋毁和诬蔑，甚至组织“示威游行”侮辱我人民领袖毛主席的像。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    我们严正地警告印度扩张主义分子，中国的神圣统一，是决不允许任何人以任何借口加以破坏的。想在西藏问题上讨点“便宜”，是绝对办不到的。西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，任何胆敢侵略西藏的阴谋，一定会在中国各族人民团结的铁拳下被打得粉碎。
    中国天主教三百万教友，坚决拥护政府命令解散策划叛乱的西藏地方政府和平息叛乱的英明措施，坚决反对英帝国主义、罗马教廷和印度扩张主义分子这种恶毒的利用宗教和西藏叛乱事件，干涉我国内政的卑鄙手段。我们为英勇的人民解放军，在平息西藏叛乱中所取得的伟大胜利而欢呼，我们为祖国统一的更加巩固和西藏人民的获得新生而庆幸。
    罗马教廷利用宗教为帝国主义和殖民主义服务的种种阴谋破坏活动，不仅不能欺骗我们觉悟了的中国天主教友，和动摇我们反帝爱国的立场，反而使我们更加擦亮了眼睛，坚定了斗志，进一步认识到罗马教廷的反动本质，认识到中国天主教与罗马教廷的关系，是两个根本对立的政治立场问题；也更加看清了：为了维护祖国的独立尊严和六亿多人民的利益，为了维护中国天主教和三百万教友的利益，中国天主教会必须继续深入开展反帝爱国运动，彻底摆脱罗马教廷的一切控制，坚决彻底实现独立自主自办教会的任务。
    我们中国三百万天主教友决心与全国人民一道，为完成和超额完成一九五九年宏伟的跃进计划贡献出一切力量，并为在十五年到二十年或更多一些时间，把我国建成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而努力奋斗。我们相信，我们的社会主义建设事业，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国各族各界人民紧密团结共同努力下，定会取得更加辉煌的成就。
