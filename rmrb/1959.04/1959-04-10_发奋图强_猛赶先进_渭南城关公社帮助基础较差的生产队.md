Work Hard and Strive for Progress, Vigorously Catch Up with the Advanced
Chengguan Commune in Weinan Helps Production Teams with Poor Foundation

    (Reported by our correspondent Yuan Mu) The Party organizations of the Chengguan People's Commune and its production brigades in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, have closely integrated the leadership methods of holding on-site evaluation meetings and concentrating efforts to tackle lagging points in the bumper harvest competition. This has effectively encouraged the enthusiasm of production teams with weaker economic and working foundations to be self-reliant, and sparked a competition upsurge throughout the commune to catch up with the advanced.

    Within the rural communes, there were varying degrees of differences in production development levels and working foundations among the production brigades (i.e., administrative districts) and production teams. The Chengguan People's Commune Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Weinan County and the general branch committees of the brigades noticed this issue after the establishment of the commune last year. They held multiple on-site evaluation meetings to promote advanced experiences, pushing the relatively backward brigades and production teams to catch up with the advanced ones. Initially, most of the on-site meetings were held in one or two advanced teams, which, although effective, also generated some inferiority complex among a few cadres and members in the relatively backward teams: "The advanced teams have the leadership's attention and good production conditions, we can't compare"; "The leadership doesn't pay attention to us, we only seek to be neither too high nor too low, neither too left nor too right, and avoid making mistakes." After discovering this situation, the commune and brigade Party organizations changed their approach. While continuing to do a good job with the advanced teams and promote their experiences, they, on the one hand, transferred cadres to the relatively backward production teams to participate in labor, understand the situation, and help the production team cadres do their work; on the other hand, they concentrated their efforts to help them achieve significant results in a certain task as quickly as possible. Then, they would hold an on-site meeting here to introduce the experience, and at the same time conduct a mass inspection of the team's other work, encouraging them to continue to move forward. This greatly encouraged the backward teams and also promoted the advanced teams.

    At the beginning of this year, when the Baiyang Production Brigade of this commune was formulating a leap forward plan, some cadres believed that the brigade had many slopes and sandy land, and the conditions were not good, so the production increase targets and measures could not match the advanced teams. The commune Party committee, on the one hand, used the fact that places with worse conditions than the Baiyang Brigade had also achieved substantial production increases, to educate everyone at the commune cadre meeting and increase their confidence in increasing production. On the other hand, it helped and urged the brigade to vigorously develop high-yield wheat plots to drive large-scale high-yield. After making achievements, the commune Party committee immediately held an on-site meeting here for the entire commune to vigorously develop high-yield wheat plots and ensure high yields on large areas of wheat, organizing more than 3,000 cadres from various brigades to visit and evaluate. After the meeting, the enthusiasm of all the members of the Baiyang Brigade doubled, ensuring high yields in high-yield wheat plots, and this year the average yield per mu of all wheat fields will catch up with the most advanced brigades. The members applied 40,000 jin of top dressing per mu within half a month, catching up with the advanced teams. Men and women, old and young, of the Tianjia Village Production Team went into action to tackle the third-class wheat seedlings. By the beginning of March, the fertilizer applied per mu had reached 100,000 jin, jumping to first place in the wheat field management of the entire commune's production teams. The work of the Zhuwang Village Production Team of the Shuangwang Brigade has always been relatively poor. Not long ago, the brigade's general branch sent cadres to help this team establish a responsibility system with fixed quality, fixed quantity, and individual responsibility for each area. They conducted mass inspections and evaluations in the competition and carried out enthusiastic production mobilization work. After these tasks achieved results, the entire brigade held an on-site meeting here to introduce the Zhuwang Team's experience. The cadres and members of the Zhuwang Team expressed at and after the meeting that: "Work is done by people. We vow to completely turn over this year and catch up with and surpass the advanced teams." The team's various tasks are now showing a new look.

    The commune Party committee and brigade general branches notify the production team where an on-site meeting is to be held in advance, encouraging them and other teams to do a good job to welcome the meeting. Therefore, the preparation work for each on-site meeting is a great promotion for each team, and a new leap forward climax appears in each team when the meeting is held. After each meeting, the team's work has progressed, especially the backward teams have made new achievements, which are notified to the entire commune or the brigade sends people to visit and learn, further improving the enthusiasm of the backward teams and promoting the continued progress of each team.

    A torrent of competition in which you chase me has now formed in this commune. At the beginning of this year, when the Shuangwang Brigade of this commune initiated a competition to all commune production brigades in Shaanxi Province with a target of an average yield of 3,000 jin of wheat per mu, many brigades and production teams in the commune did not dare to respond. Now, even the teams with the weakest foundations are proposing to "learn from Shuangwang and catch up with Shuangwang". An average wheat yield of 3,000 jin per mu has become the goal of most production teams in the entire commune this year. Last year, only one group in the entire commune caught up with the level of Zhang Qiuxiang, a cotton-growing expert in this commune, who produced more than 3,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Now, many groups in each production team are stepping up cotton field preparation, determined to work hard to "learn from Qiuxiang and catch up with Qiuxiang", and compete with Zhang Qiuxiang.

    发奋图强　猛赶先进
    渭南城关公社帮助基础较差的生产队
    本报讯　记者袁木报道：陕西省渭南县城关人民公社和各生产大队的党组织，在丰产竞赛中，把召开现场评比会议和集中力量突击落后点的领导方法紧密结合起来，有力地鼓励经济基础和工作基础较差的生产队自力更生的积极性，在全公社掀起了赶先进的竞赛热潮。
    农村公社内各生产大队（即管理区）和生产队之间，原来生产发展水平和工作基础有程度不同的差别，中共渭南县城关人民公社委员会和各生产大队的总支委员会，在去年公社成立后就注意到这个问题，曾多次召开现场评比会议推广先进经验，推动较落后的大队和生产队赶上先进队。开始时大部分现场会议都在一两个先进队召开，收效虽然不小，但在较落后的队的少数干部和社员中，也产生了一些自卑情绪：“先进队领导重视，生产条件好，咱不能比”；“领导不重视咱们，咱们但求个不上不下，不左不右，不犯错误就行了”。公社和各大队的党组织发现这种情况后，就改变了做法。他们除继续做好先进队的工作和推广他们的经验外，一方面抽调干部到比较落后的生产队，参加劳动，了解情况，帮助生产队干部做好工作；一方面集中力量尽快地帮助他们把某一项工作搞出显著成绩，然后就在这里召开现场会议，介绍经验，同时对这个队的其他工作进行一次群众性的检查，鼓励他们继续前进。这样做，对落后队鼓舞极大，对先进队也起了促进作用。
    今年初，这个公社的白杨生产大队在制定跃进计划时，有的干部认为本大队坡地和沙地多，条件不好，增产指标和措施都不能向先进队看齐。公社党委一面以比白杨大队条件更坏的地方也大幅度增产的事实，在公社干部会上教育大家，提高增产的信心，一面帮助和督促这个大队大搞小麦丰产方，以丰产方带动大面积丰产。做出成绩以后，公社党委立即在这里召开全社大闹小麦丰产方和保证大面积小麦高产的现场会议，组织各大队三千多干部前来参观评比。会后，白杨大队全体社员干劲倍增，保证小麦丰产方高额丰产，今年全部麦田平均亩产要赶上最先进的大队。社员们在半个月内每亩追肥四万斤，赶上了先进队。田家村生产队男女老幼齐上阵，突击三类麦苗，3月初每亩施肥已达十万斤，在全公社生产队的麦田管理工作中一跃而居第一位。双王大队朱王村生产队的工作一向较差，不久前，大队总支派干部帮助这个队建立定质定量和人人分片包干的责任制，在竞赛中大搞群众性的检查评比，并且开展了热火朝天的生产鼓动工作。这些工作取得成绩后，全大队在这里召开现场会议介绍了朱王队的经验。朱王队的干部和社员在会上和会后都纷纷表示：工作是人做的，咱们立誓在今年彻底翻身，赶上和超过先进队。这个队现在的各项工作都气象一新。
    公社党委和大队总支每决定在那个生产队召开现场会议，都提前通知这个队和其他队，鼓励他们做好工作，迎接会议。因此，每次现场会的准备工作都是对各队的很大促进，会议召开时各队就出现了新的跃进高潮。每次会后，那个队的工作有了进展，特别是落后队做出了新成绩，都通报全公社或大队派人去参观学习，进一步提高落后队的积极性，并推动各队继续前进。
    这个公社现在已经形成一股你追我赶的竞赛洪流。今年初这个公社的双王大队以平均亩产小麦三千斤的指标向全陕西省各公社的生产大队发起竞赛时，公社内不少大队和生产队还不敢应战，现在连基础最差的队也提出要“学双王、赶双王”，亩产小麦三千斤已成为全公社绝大部分生产队今年的奋斗目标。去年全公社只有一个组赶上这个公社植棉能手张秋香亩产籽棉三千多斤的水平，现在各个生产队都有不少组正在加紧棉田备耕，决心加劲“学秋香，赶秋香”，同张秋香比个高低。
