    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," the reports by the two Vice Premiers Li, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report. Now, I will discuss how I achieved high yields by intercropping vegetables in cotton fields.
    In 1957, we successively participated in the national and Shaanxi Provincial agricultural advanced producer representative conferences, and listened to the introduction of many representatives' high-yield experiences, especially Wang Baojing of Liquan County's agricultural scientific research and Zhang Qiuxiang of Weinan County's cotton planting experience, which deeply impressed me! I felt that achieving high and abundant yields requires diligent research in technology. I thought, "If others can do it, why can't I?" But, from what direction should I start? After repeated consideration, I thought that our cooperative has a large population but little land. If we could intercrop several crops on one piece of land in a year, wouldn't that result in high yields? So I decided to intercrop several kinds of vegetables in the cotton field. When I submitted this idea to the cooperative management committee for discussion, it was opposed by most people. Finally, with the support of the Party committee, I first experimented with one mu.
    My method was: deeply plow the land more than one chi, apply 15 cartloads of base fertilizer, make a ridge every two chi, plant hot radishes (that is, early-maturing water radishes) on both sides of the ridge, plant onions in the ridge, and plant cotton on the ridge beam with a plant spacing of seven cun, more than 3,700 plants per mu. As soon as the three crops emerged, they grew to cover the ground. Passersby ridiculed and said, "There's no way they can grow." Liu Jianbang, the director of the cooperative's supervisory committee, also jokingly said to me, "Cooperative leader Lu, you are so cruel! The crops have collapsed the land! The land will sue you." I ignored these comments and still painstakingly cultivated them day and night. However, technical difficulties arose: hot radishes and onions need more water, but cotton seedlings are afraid of too much water. If I water, it will be detrimental to the cotton; if I don't water, it will affect the growth of the hot radishes and onions. What should I do? After working hard with the branch secretary, deputy director, and technicians, we finally found a solution. I gave the hot radishes and onions small ditch irrigation, so that the water would not flood the ridge; I applied more wall-dug soil and chemical fertilizer to the cotton, and carried out intertillage to loosen the soil and increase the soil temperature. As a result, the vegetables and cotton grew very well. The first crop to be harvested was hot radishes, with a yield of more than 1,780 jin per mu, which was more than 300 jin higher than the yield of single cropping vegetables. The yield of the second crop, onions, was 2,020 jin, which was almost half as much as the general yield per mu.
    After the vegetables were harvested, the cotton was yellow and thin at this time. Some people worried about me; others satirized and said: "They have anemia." At that time, I felt very strenuous in my heart, and knew that new measures had to be taken, so I applied wall-pit soil twice in a row, five carts each time. After seven days, I shallowly irrigated once, and hoeed it once while it was moist. The cotton quickly turned black and thickened, and the stalks became thick and strong. Later, I prevented and controlled insect pests nine times, sprayed phosphorus twice, and pruned more than 20 times. Therefore, the cotton grew very well, with 19 layers of fruit branches, an average of more than 40 peaches per plant, and an actual yield of more than 1,140 jin of seed cotton per mu, which was more than 700 jin higher than the general cotton in the local area.
    During this experiment, we maintained close contact with the nearby cooperatives and teams, often exchanged experiences with them, observed and learned from each other. The intercropping method spread, with some intercropping vegetables in cotton fields, and others intercropping cotton in vegetable fields. Last year, our cooperative achieved a bumper harvest of cotton, with an average of more than 130 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The production team where I planted the experimental field averaged 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    This year, we will continue to experiment with and promote the method of intercropping vegetables in cotton fields. We will use wide and narrow rows for cotton, leaving 4,500 cotton plants per mu. In addition to intercropping early-maturing radishes and onions in the cotton rows, we will also intercrop a season of vegetables in the autumn, striving for high yields in everything.
    My education level is very low and my scientific knowledge is limited. In the future, I must diligently study in practice, humbly learn from agricultural experts, learn from experienced farmers, and learn from advanced producers in other places. I will resolutely listen to the Party's words, closely connect with the masses, and strive to victoriously complete the 1959 grain and cotton production tasks!

### 棉花蔬菜套种　三料庄稼丰收  鲁桂兰委员的发言

    棉花蔬菜套种　三料庄稼丰收
    鲁桂兰委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周总理的“政府工作报告”，两位李副总理的报告和李维汉副主席的工作报告。现在，谈谈我是怎样在棉花地里套种蔬菜而获得丰产的。
    一九五七年，我们先后参加了全国和陕西省的农业先进生产者代表大会，听了许多代表的丰产经验介绍，特别是醴泉县王保京进行的农业科学研究，渭南县张秋香植棉的一套经验，使我深深敬佩！我感到要取得高额丰产，不在技术上刻苦钻研是不行的。我想：“别人能办到，我为什么不能呢？”但是，究竟从什么方向搞起呢？经过反复琢磨，我想到我们社人多地少，如果能在一块土地上一年套种几料作物，不是可以高产吗？于是我决定在棉花地里套种几料蔬菜。当我把这个意见提交社管会讨论时，遭到了多数人的反对。最后在党委的支持下，我先搞了一亩作为试验。
    我的作法是：地深翻一尺多，施底肥十五车，每隔二尺打一畦子，畦梁两侧点种热萝卜（就是早熟的水萝卜），畦子里栽洋葱，畦梁上点种棉花，棉花株距七寸，每亩三千七百多株。三料庄稼一出土，就长得盖了地面。过路的人都讥笑说：“没办法生长。”社监察主任刘建邦也开玩笑地对我说：“鲁社长，你好心狠，庄稼把地都压塌啦！土地要告你的状了。”我没有理会这些，仍然经心地日夜培育着。但是，发生了技术困难：热萝卜、洋葱需要较多水分，棉花幼苗却怕水多。浇水吧，对棉花不利；不浇吧，会影响热萝卜、洋葱生长。怎么办呢？经过和支部书记、副主任、技术员一块苦心研究，终于找到了办法。我给热萝卜、洋葱进行小沟灌水，使水不淹畦梁；给棉花增施了坑土、化肥，并且进行了中耕松土，增加地温。结果蔬菜、棉花都长得很好。第一料先收热萝卜，每亩产量达一千七百八十多斤，比一般蔬菜地单作还高出三百多斤。第二料洋葱产量二千零二十斤，比一般亩产高出几乎一半。
    蔬菜收获后，这时棉花又黄又瘦，有的人为我担心；有的人讽刺说：“得了贫血病。”当时我心里很吃力，知道不采取新的措施不行了，就接连施了两次墙坑土，每次五车，七天以后浅灌一次，趁墒锄了一遍，棉花很快叶子发黑变厚，秆茎粗壮了。以后又防治虫害九次，喷磷两次，整枝二十多次，因而，棉花长得很好，有十九层果枝，平均每株结桃四十多个，每亩实产籽棉一千一百四十多斤，比当地一般棉花高出七百多斤。
    我们在进行这一试验的过程中，与附近的社、队保持了密切的联系，经常和他们交流经验，互相观摩，互相学习。套种的办法传开了，有棉花地里套菜的，也有菜地里套棉花的。去年我们社里的棉花获得了丰收，平均每亩收皮棉一百三十多斤。我种试验田的那个生产队，每亩平均产皮棉二百斤。
    今年我们还继续试验和推广棉田套种蔬菜的办法。棉花采用宽窄行，每亩留棉花四千五百株，在棉行里除套种早熟萝卜和洋葱外，秋季还要套种一季蔬菜，争取样样高产丰收。
    我的文化程度很低，科学知识有限，今后一定要在实践中刻苦钻研，虚心向农业专家学习，向老农学习，向外地的先进生产者学习，坚决听党的话，密切联系群众，为胜利完成一九五九年粮棉生产任务而奋斗！
