    Broad Masses of Workers Use Practical Actions to Accelerate Socialist Construction
    Poland, Hungary, and Romania Triumphantly Complete First Quarter Production Plans
    Poland
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 21st - Encouraged by the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish working class has overfulfilled the first quarter production plan for this year, achieving a successful first battle in the struggle to realize the Party's development directives for Poland in 1959-1965.
    In the key sector of Poland's national economy - the coal mining industry - miners mined 850,000 tons of coal more than planned, of which 300,000 tons were mined by miners during voluntary Sunday labor to pay tribute to the Party's "Third Congress."
    Enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry overfulfilled the quarterly plan by 4%. The steelworkers achieved the most outstanding results, with steelmakers creating a record of producing 500,000 tons of steel per month for the first time in the history of the Polish metallurgical industry. In the first quarter, Poland produced a total of 1.5 million tons of steel, which is 100,000 tons more than Poland's total steel production in 1938.
    Polish power workers produced more than 6.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first three months, more than 160 million kilowatt-hours more than planned, fully meeting the electricity needs of industry and residents. In addition, power workers saved the country 110,000 tons of coal.
    The total output value of the chemical industry in the first quarter of this year increased by 17% compared with the same period last year. The production of all products in the chemical industry exceeded the original plan by 2% to 4%. Among them, the production of nylon exceeded the original plan by 17%.
    At the beginning of this year, millions of Polish workers launched a production upsurge to welcome the Party's "Third Congress," and many workers put forward guarantees to overfulfill the first quarter production plan. Many factories also organized shock brigades and launched heated competitions. The Matylda coal mine in Silesia completed 114% of its daily output plan on the first day of the "Third Congress." Due to the high enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, not only did most factories complete the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule, but even enterprises that had consistently failed to complete their plans overfulfilled their plans this time.
    Hungary
    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 22nd - The Hungarian Central Statistical Office pointed out in its recent communique on the implementation of the national economic plan for the first quarter of this year that Hungarian state-owned industry completed 100% of the first quarter production plan, with an average daily output increase of 5% compared with the same period last year, a labor productivity increase of 1%, and a 4% increase in the number of workers.
    The chemical and pharmaceutical industries achieved great results in the first quarter. Nitrogen fertilizer production increased by 138%, and vitamin production roughly doubled.
    In the first quarter, Hungary's coal production reached 6.2 million tons, an increase of 3% over the original plan; electricity reached 1.7 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 9% compared with the same period last year; coke increased by 12% compared with the same period last year, pig iron increased by 3%, and hot-rolled steel increased by 5%.
    In terms of consumer goods, milk production increased by 10%, and bacon increased by 20%.
    In terms of foreign trade, exports increased by 15% compared with the same period last year, and imports increased by 3%.
    Residents' income increased by 5% compared with the same period last year. Domestic trade retail sales increased by 7% compared with the same period last year.
    According to statistics from all sides, Hungary achieved great success in the socialist transformation of agriculture in the first quarter of this year. As of March 31, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the country reached 4,490, with a total of 523,000 cooperative members and a cultivated area of 2.91 million hectares. At present, the cultivated area of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 49% of the country's cultivated area, of which the cultivated area of production cooperatives accounts for 35%.
    This year, Hungary's spring plowing and sowing work was very timely and completed better than in previous years. Agricultural production cooperatives used more than twice as much chemical fertilizer as last year. As of April 1, agricultural machinery stations in various places had overfulfilled the spring plowing and sowing plan by 60%.
    Romania
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, April 21st - It was announced here that Romania's industrial sectors have overfulfilled the first quarter production plan for this year.
    The entire heavy industry sector completed 103.1% of the original task for the first quarter. Among them, the metallurgical industry achieved the most outstanding results, completing 106.4% of the original plan, exceeding the production of 34,948 tons of steel and more than 12,000 tons of steel. Some of the larger steel mills completed the first quarter production plan more than ten days ahead of schedule.
    In other heavy industrial sectors, the coal mining industry completed 103.3% of the original plan, and the national coal mines increased production by 45,000 tons of coal. The building materials industry produced enough materials to build 545 apartments above the plan. The oil processing industry produced 9,900 tons of gasoline and 2,793 tons of other fuels above the plan, and oil drilling workers drilled 8,300 meters above the plan. The 1959 national economic development plan of Romania stipulates that the total industrial output value will increase by 10% compared with last year, reaching more than five times that of 1948. In order to complete and overfulfill the 1959 industrial production plan, the broad masses of workers across the country enthusiastically launched a socialist labor competition in the first quarter. In the competition, many factories and mines greatly improved labor productivity and equipment utilization. For example, the labor productivity of the Hunedoara Metallurgical United Factory increased by 23% compared with the original target. The utilization rate of the Martin furnace in the Crosh wire factory increased by 24%, and the utilization rate of the electric furnace increased by 13.7%.
    In terms of saving raw materials, factories and enterprises generally achieved good results in the first three months of this year. The "Ernst Thälmann" tractor factory saved a total of 500 tons of metal in the first quarter, exceeding the original savings plan by 32%. The Roman Steel Plant reduced production costs by 14%.

    波匈罗三国首季生产计划胜利完成
    波兰
    新华社华沙21日电　在波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会决议的鼓舞下，波兰工人阶级超额完成了今年第一季度生产计划，在实现党关于1959—1965年波兰发展指示的斗争中首战告捷。
    在波兰国民经济的重点部门——采煤工业部门中，矿工们比原计划多采了八十五万吨煤，其中有三十万吨煤是矿工们为了向党的“三大”献礼，在义务星期日劳动中采掘的。
    重工业部所属各企业超额4％完成了季度计划。其中钢铁工人的成绩最为出色，炼钢工人在波兰冶金工业史上第一次创造了月产五十万吨钢的纪录。在第一季度中波兰共生产一百五十万吨钢，这比1938年波兰全年的钢产量还多十万吨。
    波兰电力工人在头三个月中共生产了六十五亿多度电，比原计划多生产了一亿六千多度，完全满足了工业和居民用电的需要。此外，电力工人还为国家节约了十一万吨煤。
    今年第一季度化学工业生产总值比去年同一时期增长了17％。化学工业所有产品的生产量都超过了原计划2％到4％。其中尼龙的生产量超过了原计划的17％。
    今年一开始，波兰就有几百万工人掀起了迎接党的“三大”的生产热潮，许多工人都提出了超额完成第一季度生产计划的保证。许多工厂还组织了突击队，展开了热烈的竞赛。西里西亚的马提耳达煤矿在“三大”的第一天就完成了日产量计划的114％。由于广大工人的劳动热情高涨，不仅大部分工厂提前完成了第一季度生产计划，连一向完不成计划的企业这次也超额完成了计划。
    匈牙利
    新华社布达佩斯22日电　匈牙利中央统计局在最近发表的关于今年第一季度国民经济计划执行情况的公报中指出，匈牙利国营工业百分之百地完成了第一季度的生产计划，平均日产量比去年同时期增加了5％，劳动生产率增长了1％，工人数目增加了4％。
    化学和医药工业在第一季度中获得了很大的成绩。氮肥生产增加了138％，维生素的生产增加一倍左右。
    在第一季度中，匈牙利煤产量达六百二十万吨，比原计划增加了3％；电力十七亿度，比去年同时期增加了9％；焦炭比去年同期增加了12％，生铁增加了3％，热轧钢增加了5％。
    在消费品方面，牛奶的产量增加了10％，咸肉增加了20％。
    在对外贸易方面，出口额比去年同时期增加了15％，进口额增加了3％。
    居民的收入比去年同时期增加了5％。国内贸易零售额比去年同期增加了7％。
    据各方面的统计材料，匈牙利今年第一季度在农业的社会主义改造方面取得了很大的成就。到3月31日为止，全国农业生产合作社已达四千四百九十个，合作社社员的总数达五十二万三千人，耕地面积达到二百九十一万霍尔特。目前国营农场和农业生产合作社的耕地面积已占全国耕地面积的49％。其中生产合作社的耕地面积占35％。
    今年，匈牙利春耕春播工作非常及时，比往年都完成得好。农业生产合作社使用化肥的数量比去年增加了两倍多。各地的农业机器站到4月1日为止，超额60％完成了春耕春播计划。
    罗马尼亚
    新华社布加勒斯特21日电　据这里宣布，罗马尼亚各工业部门超额完成了今年第一季度生产计划。
    整个重工业部门第一季度的生产完成了原订任务的103.1％，其中，冶金工业成绩最为突出，完成了原订计划106.4％，超额生产了三万四千九百四十八吨钢和一万二千多吨钢材。一些规模较大的炼钢厂都提前十多天完成了第一季度生产计划。
    在其他重工业部门方面，采煤工业完成了原订计划的103.3％，全国煤矿增产了四万五千吨煤。建筑材料工业超计划生产的材料可以修建五百四十五套住房。石油加工业超计划生产了九千九百吨汽油和二千七百九十三吨其他油料，石油钻井工人超计划钻进了八千三百公尺。罗马尼亚1959年国民经济发展计划规定，工业总产值将比去年增加10％，达到1948年的五倍以上。全国广大职工为完成和超额完成1959年工业生产计划，在第一季度中热烈地展开了社会主义劳动竞赛。在竞赛中，许多厂矿都大大提高了劳动生产率和设备利用率。例如，洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的劳动生产率比原订指标还提高了23％。克罗什的铁丝工厂的马丁炉的利用率提高了24％，电炉利用率提高了13.7％。
    在节约原材料方面，各工厂企业在今年头三月中普遍获得了良好的成绩。“恩斯特·台尔曼”拖拉机工厂在第一季度中共节约了五百吨金属，超过原订的节约计划32％。罗曼钢铁厂把生产成本降低了14％。
