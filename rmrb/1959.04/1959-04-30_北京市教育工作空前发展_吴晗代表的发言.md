Beijing's educational work has developed unprecedentedly
Comrade Representatives:

Under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and with the vigorous support of all fraternal provinces and cities, the various tasks in Beijing have developed rapidly and achieved great results, with the people of the city exerting their utmost efforts. The same is true of education. We must not be complacent about the achievements we have made, but we must give them a correct assessment.

Proportion of Students Enrolled to Population: One-tenth before liberation, now one-quarter; primary and junior high school education is now universal

At present, there are more than 98,000 students in various universities and colleges in Beijing. There are more than 265,000 students in secondary schools, including more than 223,000 students in ordinary middle schools. There are more than 820,000 primary school students. There are more than 370,000 children in kindergartens. The total is 1.56 million, accounting for about one-quarter of the city's population, with one in four people being students. In addition, there are 356,000 workers and peasants participating in spare-time university, middle and primary school studies.

Before liberation, Beijing was known as a city of culture. Taking the figures of 1949 as an example, there were only more than 14,200 university students. There were more than 43,200 secondary school students, including more than 40,100 students in ordinary middle schools. There were more than 142,300 primary school students. There were more than 2,200 children in kindergartens. The total was 200,200 people. Compared with the population at that time, only one in ten people was a student.

After ten years of development, the number of students increased from 200,000 to 1.56 million, excluding the increase due to the newly划区 (newly demarcated districts) but also 1.228 million people, an increase of about six times, and the proportion of the population increased from one-tenth to one-quarter, which should be said to be very fast. The particularly fast year was 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward. The previous year's figures were more than 80,900 university students. There were more than 201,900 secondary school students, including more than 171,200 students in ordinary middle schools. There were more than 468,500 primary school students. There were more than 66,100 children in kindergartens. The total was 827,000 people. Only one year later, it leaped to 1.228 million people (excluding the increase due to the newly划区), an increase of about 48.5 percent. This speed of development is unprecedented. One of the reasons is that the people's communes have been established, and the need for primary schools and kindergartens is particularly urgent. The number of children in kindergartens in the city accounts for 53 percent of the 600,000 children aged 3 to 6, of which about 80 percent of the children in the suburbs are in kindergartens. Second, we mobilize the masses and use the method of "walking on two legs," combining state-run and mass-run education. The state allocates certain investments for the construction of new schools in the suburbs, and the townships and communes allocate land and organize the masses to build them. The combination of state power and mass power has smoothly completed the construction of schools. In the four counties in the remote suburbs, in addition to developing public middle schools, the masses were mobilized to run 65 private middle schools. The cause of preschool education is basically the mobilization of the masses, and the townships, communes, and street residents run it themselves. If we do not use the method of "walking on two legs," if we do not combine state-run and mass-run, then preschool education will not be able to be run so quickly and so much.

The construction of the school network has also made great progress. There are currently 3,682 primary schools and 390 middle schools. Every village has a primary school, and every township has a junior high school. There are 102 high schools. Each district in the remote suburbs has at least two high schools, and each of the four counties also has a high school. Each district and county has a normal school. In the city as a whole, primary and junior high school education has been popularized.

Combining Education with Productive Labor, Students Achieve a Triple Harvest of Reading, Labor, and Ideology

Where do these achievements come from? This is mainly because we have implemented the central government's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, which has fundamentally changed the situation of education being divorced from productive labor for thousands of years.

Since the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the decision to improve the quality of education in June 1954, the quality of education and teaching has been significantly improved through the efforts of teachers and students at all levels of schools in the city. Since Chairman Mao put forward the educational policy of cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, our education work has entered a new stage. In the second half of 1957, all middle schools generally organized students to participate in various labor activities. Students in rural areas mainly participated in agricultural labor, and students in cities participated in public welfare labor and social service labor inside and outside the school. Through these labor activities, students came into contact with workers and peasants, and began to change their incorrect views on labor and working people. Since the spring of 1958, a campaign of diligence and thrift in studying has been launched. After the summer vacation, according to the central government's instructions on education work, students were further organized to participate in industrial and agricultural labor. Middle schools and factories were generally linked up, and students were organized to work in factories. Some factories set up workshops in schools, and some schools also set up workshops themselves. Hundreds of thousands of teachers and students participated in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, and participated in deep plowing, autumn harvest, and steelmaking. They showed a high degree of socialist labor enthusiasm in their labor, and their socialist consciousness was significantly improved. Their labor views were strengthened, and they were close to the working people in their thoughts and feelings, and loving labor and working people has become a common practice. Through the exercise of labor production, their organization and discipline have been strengthened, their collectivist thinking has been promoted, their life experience has become richer, and their bodies have also been exercised.

After half a year of practice, although the gains were great, some difficulties were also encountered. The main problems are that students have to travel a long way to work in factories, which takes time; factories require relatively continuous and fixed manpower for production, while students can only participate intermittently and in rotation; the problems of raw materials, sales, and transportation are not easy to solve for schools running their own workshops, and so on. In order to further implement the Party's education policy, it is necessary to summarize past experience, carry out rectification, and make unified arrangements for students' learning and labor. The method is to combine public welfare labor, agricultural labor, and organizing factories to set up workshops in schools. The students' working hours are eight hours per week for high school students and six hours per week for junior high school students, all of which are carried out twice. Among them, the problems of organizing factories to set up workshops in schools, raw materials, sales, transportation, and the rational arrangement of students' study time and working hours have all been solved. Not only do students save time traveling to and from the factory, but it also creates more favorable conditions for teachers to participate in labor and to implement the principle of linking theory with practice in teaching. Teachers and students participate in labor regularly and fixedly, and labor becomes a formal course in the school, so that students can both work well and study well.

From last December to now, 88 of the 92 middle schools in the four urban areas of the capital have been linked up with 105 factories. One hundred and sixty-three workshops have been set up in schools. Among them, there are 88 electromechanical workshops, 25 chemical workshops, and 50 other types of workshops. The Party secretaries and factory directors of many factories have gone to the schools to arrange and guide the work of establishing workshops, and try their best to arrange the workshops to suit the combination of teaching. And sent more than 600 workers to the school to guide and participate in production. In this way, students not only enter the classroom to learn book knowledge, but also enter the classroom to learn production knowledge and technology; students not only have teachers who teach book knowledge, but also have teachers who teach production knowledge. Students are not only students in schools, but also workers and peasant students at the same time. Students participate in the ranks of the working people, realize the greatness of labor and working people, and the working class's organization, discipline, and the quality of cherishing public property and cherishing the collective are gradually forming. The students' thoughts and feelings have changed. In the past, they were afraid of getting dirty and tired, and disliked oil and mud, but now they have changed their views. One student wrote a poem: "In the past, I only disliked the oil for being dirty, but today I smell the oil and it smells good. The oil is on my body, like wearing a flower." Many schools' students have not only undergone great changes in their thinking, but also learned and learned some production knowledge, and can not only use their brains, but also use their hands. From labor practice, the knowledge learned in the classroom has been deepened and consolidated, and the quality of learning has been improved. In well-arranged schools, students have achieved a triple harvest of reading, labor, and ideology.

Some schools have very small sites, and some schools are close to factories, so they continue to organize students to work in factories. In addition to participating in industrial labor, students in urban areas should also participate in agricultural production appropriately. Students in rural schools are mainly organized to participate in agricultural production, and some industrial production labor is organized according to the needs of rural areas and the situation of raw materials. At the same time, students in both urban and suburban areas also participate in some public welfare labor and social service labor outside the school.

Teaching and Learning from Each Other, Teachers Play a Leading Role

Many teachers also participate in labor with the students. Not only have their thoughts and feelings changed significantly, but their relationship with the students has also changed. Collective labor has broken down the barriers between teachers and students. They learn from each other and teach and learn from each other. Through labor practice, teachers can teach better and teach better. In teaching, teachers better play a leading role. Teachers feel comfortable and truly understand the joy of being both a student and a teacher. Some of the teachers had doubts about the Party's education policy in the past. After a year of practice, they realized that as long as it is well arranged, learning and labor can promote each other, and they are willing to work hard to implement the Party's education policy and become promoters. The vast ranks of teachers are beginning to undergo qualitative changes.

At the same time, factories establish workshops in schools, incorporating the production labor of more than 100,000 middle school students in urban areas into the national production plan, becoming a supplementary force in industrial production and supporting the Great Leap Forward in industry. For example, one middle school produced 3,919 resistance starters and 1,795 safety transformers in the fourth quarter of last year, worth 890,000 yuan, which strongly supported the factory's leap forward plan, which is a clear example.

It should also be pointed out that our work has only just begun a new chapter and explored a set of methods, but there are still many problems in our work that need to be further resolved. First of all, with the urban reconstruction and the development of modern factories, the combination of factories and schools and the production projects of schools must be considered and arranged from the overall situation of the city. Secondly, the factories and schools that have established cooperation should sum up experience at any time to consolidate and improve. Thirdly, we must strengthen the ideological education of students. At present, a small number of students neglect the study of book knowledge, thinking that it is enough to work well. It does not matter whether book knowledge is learned well or not. Therefore, it is necessary to educate them to correctly understand the relationship between learning and labor, and must adhere to the efforts to learn culture well and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

In the future, our task is to further carry out the work of rectification, consolidation and improvement on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. Under the strong leadership of the Party, we firmly believe that Beijing's education work, like other work in the city and the country, will achieve greater results and better serve the politics of the working class and the socialist cause.

    北京市教育工作空前发展
    吴晗代表的发言各位代表：
    北京市的各项工作，在党中央和国务院的直接领导下，各兄弟省市大力支持，全市人民鼓足干劲，发展很快，成绩很大。教育工作也是如此。我们对于已得的成绩决不能自满，但是，必须予以正确的估计。
    在学学生按人口比例：解放前为十分之一，现在为四分之一；小学和初中教育已普及
    目前，北京各高等学校共有学生九万八千多人。中等学校学生二十六万五千多人，其中普通中学学生二十二万三千多人。小学学生八十二万多人。幼儿园幼儿三十七万多人。总数为一百五十六万人。约占全市人口的四分之一，每四个人中就有一个是在学的学生。另外还有参加业余大、中、小学学习的职工和农民三十五万六千人。
    北京在解放以前，就号称为文化城市了。那时候的情况，举一九四九年的数字作例，高等学校学生才一万四千二百多人。中等学校学生四万三千二百多人，其中普通中学学生四万零一百多人。小学学生十四万二千三百多人。幼儿园幼儿二千二百多人。总数是二十万零二千人。和当时人口比较，十个人里头才有一个是在学的学生。
    经过十年的发展，在学学生数从二十万增加到一百五十六万，除因新划区而增加的以外也还有一百二十二万八千人，约增加了六倍，按人口比例从十分之一增加到四分之一，应该说是很快的。其中特别快的一年是一九五八年，也就是大跃进的一年。前一年的数字是高等学校学生八万零九百多人。中等学校学生二十万一千九百多人，其中普通中学学生十七万一千二百多人。小学学生四十六万八千五百多人。幼儿园幼儿六万六千一百多人。总数为八十二万七千人。只隔一年，就跃进到一百二十二万八千人（不包括因新划区而增加的数字），约增长百分之四十八点五。这个发展速度是空前的，原因之一是人民公社化了，小学和幼儿园的需要特别迫切，全市入园幼儿占三岁至六岁六十万幼儿的百分之五十三，其中，郊区入园幼儿约占百分之八十。第二是发动群众，用两条腿走路的办法，国家举办和群众自办相结合大办教育。郊区新建学校由国家拨给一定的投资，乡社拨出土地，并组织群众力量进行修建，国家力量与群众力量结合，顺利地完成了建校工作。在远郊的四个县，除发展公立中学外，还发动群众办了六十五所民办中学。幼儿教育事业基本上是发动群众，由乡、社和街道居民自己办起来的。如果不用两条腿走路的办法，如果不是国家举办和发动群众自办并举，那末幼儿教育根本不可能办得这样快和这样多。
    学校网的建设也有很大的发展，现有小学三千六百八十二校，中学三百九十校。已经做到村村有小学，乡乡有初中。高中达到一百零二校，远郊区每区至少有两所高中，四个县每县也有了一所高中。每区、县都有一所师范学校。在全市来说，小学和初中教育已经做到普及了。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，学生获得了读书、劳动、思想三丰收
    这些成绩从何而来呢？这主要是贯彻执行了中央的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，基本上改变了几千年来教育脱离生产劳动的状况。
    从一九五四年六月中共北京市委发布了提高教育质量的决定以后，通过全市各级学校师生的努力，教育和教学质量有了显著的提高。从毛主席提出了培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者的教育方针以后，我们的教育工作又进入一个新的阶段。一九五七年下半年，各中学都普遍组织学生参加各种劳动，在农村的学生主要参加农业劳动，城市的学生参加校内外的公益劳动和社会服务性的劳动。通过这些劳动，学生接触了工农，开始扭转了对劳动、对劳动人民的不正确的看法。从一九五八年春天起，又普遍展开了勤工俭学劳动。暑假以后，根据中央对教育工作的指示，进一步组织学生参加工农业劳动，中学和工厂普遍挂钩，组织学生到工厂劳动，有的工厂在学校设立了车间，有些学校自己也办起了车间。几十万师生参加了工农业生产大跃进的行列，参加了深翻土地、秋收和炼钢。他们在劳动中表现了高度的社会主义的劳动热情，社会主义觉悟有了显著的提高。他们的劳动观点加强了，在思想感情上和劳动人民接近了，热爱劳动和劳动人民，已经形成风气，经过劳动生产的锻炼，他们的组织性纪律性加强了，集体主义思想发扬了，生活经验更加丰富了，身体也受到锻炼。
    经过半年的实践，虽然收获很大，但是也遭遇到一些困难。主要的问题是学生到工厂去劳动，有的要跑很远的路，来回费时间；工厂要求比较连续地固定人手生产，而学生则只能间断地轮流参加；学校自办车间，原料、销路、运输等问题都不好解决等等。为了进一步贯彻党的教育方针，有必要总结过去经验，进行整顿，对学生的学习和劳动加以统一安排。办法是实行公益劳动、农业劳动和组织工厂在学校设车间相结合。学生的劳动时间，高中每周八小时，初中每周六小时，都分两次进行。其中组织工厂在学校设车间，原料、销路、运输，和学生学习时间、劳动时间的合理安排等问题都解决了。不但学生节省了到工厂的往返时间，也为教师参加劳动，和给教学中贯彻理论联系实际的原则创造了更有利的条件。师生参加劳动经常化了，固定化了，劳动成为学校的正式课程，使学生既能劳动好，又能学习好。
    从去年十二月到现在，首都四个城区九十二所中学已经有八十八校和一百零五个工厂挂了钩。在学校设立了一百六十三个车间。其中有机电车间八十八个，化工车间二十五个，其他工种车间五十个。许多工厂的党委书记和厂长到学校安排和指导建立车间的工作，尽量设法把车间安排得适合于结合教学。并且派出六百多工人到学校指导和参加生产。这样，学校的学生不但进学习书本知识的课堂，又进了学习生产知识和技术的课堂了；学生不但有传授书本知识的老师，又有传授生产知识的老师了。学生不只是学校里的学生，也同时是工人，是农民的学生了。学生参加了劳动人民的行列，体会到劳动和劳动人民的伟大，工人阶级的组织性、纪律性和爱护公物、爱护集体的品质在逐渐形成了。学生的思想感情起了变化，过去怕脏怕累，厌恶油泥，现在改变看法了。有一个学生写了一首诗：“过去光嫌机油脏，今日闻着机油香，机油沾在我身上，好像戴上花一样。”不少学校的学生不仅在思想上有很大的转变，而且学到和学会了一些生产知识，不只会用脑子，也会用手了。从劳动实践中，加深和巩固了课堂所学得的知识，学习的质量提高了。在安排得好的学校里，学生得到了读书、劳动、思想的三丰收。
    也有些学校场地很小，有些学校邻近工厂，就继续组织学生到工厂劳动。城区学生除了参加工业劳动以外，还要适当地参加农业生产。农村学校的学生主要是组织他们参加农业生产，并且根据农村的需要和原料的情况，组织一些工业生产劳动。同时，不论城郊区的学生，也还参加一些校外的公益劳动和社会服务性的劳动。
    教学相长，教师发挥了主导作用
    许多教师也和学生一起参加劳动，不但思想、感情有了显著的改变，和学生的关系也改变了，集体的劳动打破了师生间的隔阂，切磋琢磨，教学相长，教师通过劳动的实践，书好教了，也教得好了。在教学中教师更好地发挥了主导的作用。教师的心情舒畅了，真正懂得了又当学生又当老师的乐趣。其中也有一部分教师过去曾对党的教育方针有怀疑，经过这一年的实践，认识到只要安排得好，学习和劳动是可以互相促进的，愿意努力贯彻党的教育方针，成为促进派了。广大教师队伍正在开始起着质的变化。
    同时，工厂在学校建立车间，把城区十多万中学生的生产劳动纳入国家的生产计划，成为工业生产中的一支补充力量，支援了工业的大跃进。例如有一个中学在去年第四季度生产了三千九百一十九台电阻起动器和一千七百九十五台安全变压器，价值八十九万元，有力地支援了工厂的跃进计划，就是一个明显的例子。
    也应该指出，我们的工作还仅仅是开始了新的一章，摸索了一套办法，但是，工作中还存在不少问题有待于进一步的解决。首先是随着城市的改建和现代化工厂的发展，厂、校的结合和学校的生产项目都要从全市一盘棋出发考虑安排。其次已经建立协作的厂、校，要随时总结经验，作到巩固和提高。第三要加强对学生的思想教育，目前有少数学生忽视书本知识的学习，认为只要劳动好就行了。书本知识学得好不好没有关系，因而必须要教育他们正确地认识学习和劳动的关系，必须坚持努力学好文化，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    今后我们的任务是在去年大跃进的基础上，进一步进行整顿、巩固和提高的工作。在党的坚强领导下，我们坚信，北京的教育工作，将会和全市全国其他工作一样，取得更大的成绩，更好地为工人阶级的政治服务，为社会主义事业服务。
