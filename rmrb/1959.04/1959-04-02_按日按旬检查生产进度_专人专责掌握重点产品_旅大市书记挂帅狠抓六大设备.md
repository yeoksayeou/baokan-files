　　Check Production Progress Daily and Every Ten Days
　　Assign Dedicated Personnel to Grasp Key Products
　　Lüda City Secretary Takes Command to Vigorously Grasp Six Major Pieces of Equipment
(Our Newspaper Lüda, April 1st dispatch) The CCP Lüda Municipal Committee has adopted various practical and effective measures to mobilize the city's industrial forces, speed up the production of six major key products such as rolling mills and mining machinery, and ensure the completion of tasks in terms of quantity, quality, and on schedule.
　　The six major key products currently being rushed to produce in Lüda City include: eight sets of large and medium-sized rolling mills, twenty-four sets of large and medium-sized power station equipment, one hundred and sixty-nine thousand horsepower of diesel engine and other irrigation and drainage equipment, fifty sets of washing and sorting equipment, nine items of supporting products for rolling mills, etc., four hundred locomotives, and one thousand five hundred cranes for metallurgical and other purposes. The first five of these key equipment items will be completed in the second quarter, according to national requirements.
　　In order to ensure the timely completion of the second quarter's tasks, the CCP Lüda Municipal Committee decided to establish a headquarters headed by Secretary of the Secretariat Hu Ming to uniformly dispatch the city's manpower, electricity, equipment, and raw materials to support the Dalian Shipyard, General Machinery Factory, Lüda Machinery Factory, Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, and other factories and mines manufacturing key equipment. Currently, more than twenty units across the city have transferred the most experienced veteran workers to key units that produce large parts for sand casting and turbine blade processing. Recently, major factories have also established corresponding command organizations to specifically arrange production progress, compile quarterly, monthly, ten-day, and daily operation plans, and check production progress by parts, by day, and by ten days. The city headquarters has also established a system of special commissioners and inspectors in key units to discover and solve problems in collaboration and manufacturing at any time. All key products implement a system of dedicated personnel, dedicated projects, and dedicated responsibility, so that the progress and specifications of thousands of parts distributed in hundreds of factories are coordinated with each other.
　　Before taking these emergency measures, the CCP Lüda Municipal Committee held an enlarged meeting. In accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard," it put forward the slogan of "exerting full effort, overcoming difficulties, vigorously carrying out collaboration, and ensuring key points" to the people of the city, and organized cadres and workers to study, further establishing the concept of facing the whole country and focusing on key points in production activities, and launched a city-wide large-scale collaboration to rush production of key products. The main manufacturing plants and collaborating plants have all transferred their main manpower and material resources to the main attack front, so that the vast amount of collaborative parts have been completed within the city. Because the Dalian General Machinery Factory and the Lüda Machinery Factory did not have equipment for casting large steel parts, they encountered difficulties when undertaking the production of two sets of medium plate rolling mills and two sets of thin plate rolling mills. The Dalian Shipyard, Crane Factory, and other five units took out their own equipment in the midst of their busy schedules and promoted new technologies such as electroslag welding to undertake the production task of one thousand four hundred tons of steel castings. Dozens of units, such as the Dalian Chemical Factory, Refrigeration Machine Factory, and Wood Factory, also adopted technical measures to break down professional boundaries and joined the ranks of rushing to produce key products.
　　In order to increase the "supporting role" strength in manufacturing key equipment, party committees at all levels are vigorously rectifying and improving the more than six thousand civilian-run factories, large enterprise satellite factories, school work-study factories, and county and district industries that have been established since last year, and gradually incorporating the production, supply, and sales of important parts into the national plan to make parts for large factories.
　　The CCP Lüda Municipal Committee recently launched more than one hundred factories, mines, schools, and organizations in the city to clear inventories and calculate materials that can be transferred externally to support key products. According to incomplete statistics, in less than a week, various units have calculated more than four thousand tons of coal, three thousand tons of iron, steel, and one hundred and forty-eight sets of mechanical and electrical equipment, and reported them to relevant units in the city for unified distribution.

### 按日按旬检查生产进度  专人专责掌握重点产品  旅大市书记挂帅狠抓六大设备

    按日按旬检查生产进度
    专人专责掌握重点产品
    旅大市书记挂帅狠抓六大设备
    本报旅大1日电　中共旅大市委采取各种切实有效的措施调动全市工业力量，加紧赶制轧钢机、矿山机械等六大重点产品，保证按量、按质、按期完成任务。
    旅大市目前正在赶制的六大重点产品计有：大中型轧钢机八套，大中型电站设备二十四套，柴油机等排灌设备十六万九千马力、洗选设备五十台、为轧钢机等配套产品九项、机车四百台、冶金及其他用途的起重机一千五百台等。这些重点设备的前五项，按国家要求将分别在第二季度内全部完成。
    为了保证按时完成二季度任务，中共旅大市委决定成立以书记处书记胡明为首的指挥部，统一调度全市的人力、电力、设备和原材料等，支援大连造船厂，通用机器厂和旅大机器厂、机车车辆厂等制造重点设备的厂矿。目前全市二十多个单位，已把最有经验的老工人调到生产大型部件翻砂和汽轮机叶片加工的关键单位去。各重点工厂最近也建立了相应的指挥机构，具体安排生产进度，编排季、月、旬、日作业计划，并按部件、按日、按旬检查生产进度。全市指挥部并在重点单位建立了特派员和检查员制度，随时发现解决协作和制造中的问题。全部重点产品都实行了专人、专案、专责制，以便使成千上万的部件在上百个工厂分散配制中，进度和规格等都相互协调。
    在这采取紧急措施以前，中共旅大市委举行了扩大会议，根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，向全市人民提出了“鼓足干劲、攻破困难、大搞协作、保证重点”的号召，并组织干部和工人进行了学习，进一步在生产活动中树立了面向全国，面向重点的观点，展开了全市性的赶制重点产品的大协作。各主制厂和协作厂都把主要人力和物力调集到主攻战线上来，因而浩繁的协作件都在本市落了底。大连通用机器厂和旅大机器厂因都没有铸大型钢件的设备，在承制两套中板轧机和两套薄板轧机的时候，遇到了困难，大连造船厂、起重机厂等五个单位，就在百忙中拿出本厂设备，并推行电渣焊等新技术，担负了一千四百吨铸钢件的生产任务。大连化工厂、冷冻机厂和木工厂等数十个单位，也采取技术措施，打破专业界线，加入到赶制重点产品的行列中来。
    为了增加制造重点设备的“配角”力量，各级党委正大力整顿提高去年以来办起的六千多个民办工厂、大企业卫星工厂、学校勤工俭学工厂和县区工业等，把重要部分的产、供、销都逐步纳入国家计划，为大工厂作配件。
    中共旅大市委最近还发动全市一百多个厂矿、学校和机关，清查库存，核算可供外调，支援重点产品的物资。据不完全统计，在不到一星期的时间内，各单位就核算出四千多吨煤、三千多吨钢铁、钢材和一百四十八台机电设备等，报请市内有关单位统一分配。
