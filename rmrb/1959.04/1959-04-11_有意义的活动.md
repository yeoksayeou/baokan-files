　　Holding materials exchange meetings at each level is a very meaningful activity for promoting current industrial and agricultural production and invigorating the urban and rural economy.

　　The small rural and local specialty products produced and managed by the production teams of the people's communes and individual members are complex in variety and large in quantity. It is difficult for the national commercial departments to understand clearly which regions produce small commodities and which regions need small commodities all at once. Holding such materials exchange meetings can enable direct contact between producers and sellers, facilitate the sale of small commodities and local products, facilitate mutual exchange and adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies between communes, teams, and commercial departments, and promote cooperation.

　　Successfully holding rural materials exchange meetings is one of the important tasks for promoting the economic development of the people's communes. Through the exchange and distribution of materials, production is promoted and conditions are further created for expanding the scope of distribution. Therefore, materials exchange meetings are an important activity of the commercial departments, and the production departments must actively cooperate and provide strong support.

　　有意义的活动
    逐级召开物资交流会，对于推动当前工农业生产，活跃城乡经济，是一个很有意义的活动。
    人民公社生产队与社员个人所生产经营的小宗农村土特产品，品种复杂，数量繁多，国家商业部门对什么地区生产小宗商品和哪些地区需要小宗商品，也难一下了解清楚。召开这种物资交流会，就可以使产销直接见面，便于小商品小土产的出售，便于社与社、队与队及商业部门之间互通有无、调剂余缺，开展协作。
    开好农村物资交流会，是促进人民公社经济发展的重要工作之一。通过物资交流和分配，就促进了生产并进一步为扩大分配范围创造条件。因此，物资交流会是商业部门的一项重要活动，生产部门必须积极配合并给以有力的支持。
