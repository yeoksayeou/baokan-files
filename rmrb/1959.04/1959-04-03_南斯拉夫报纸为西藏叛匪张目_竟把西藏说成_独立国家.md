Xinhua News Agency, April 1st dispatch from Belgrade: Yugoslavian newspapers, in publishing news about the Tibetan rebellion, have openly referred to Tibet as an "independent country."

    The "Politika" newspaper, on March 25th, when publishing a map of Tibet, placed Tibet and Xinjiang outside of China's national border. This newspaper used the same type of border line to delineate China, Tibet, Xinjiang, India, and Burma. On March 20th, "Borba," in introducing Tibet's geographical situation, again referred to Tibet as a "country" surrounded by mountains. Another newspaper, "Vecernje Novosti," said that Tibet was a "country of lamas and priests."

    Yugoslavian newspapers have shown particular interest in the Tibetan rebellion. They have prominently published a large number of carefully selected and edited telegrams according to their needs. From these newspapers, one can see the following reports which completely distort the truth: "The direct cause of the current disturbances is the Chinese government's order for the Dalai Lama to go to Beijing without his usual entourage" ("Borba," "Politika"); the Chinese government "attempted to arrest the Dalai Lama" ("Borba," "Politika"); "In Lhasa, there was an uprising against the Chinese occupying forces and administrators" ("Oslobodjenje"); "The Chinese authorities are increasingly undermining and compressing" the "certain autonomous rights" given to Tibet ("Borba," "Politika"), and so on.

    南斯拉夫报纸为西藏叛匪张目
    竟把西藏说成“独立国家”
    新华社1日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫报纸在刊载有关西藏叛乱的消息时，公然把西藏说成是一个“独立的国家”。
    “政治报”3月25日在刊登西藏地图时，把西藏和新疆划在中国的国界线以外。这家报纸把中国、西藏、新疆、印度和缅甸用同样的国界线加以划分。3月20日的“战斗报”在介绍西藏的地理情况时，又把西藏说成是一个为群山环绕的“国家”。另外一家报纸“新闻晚报”则说西藏是一个“喇嘛和牧师的国家”。
    南斯拉夫报纸对西藏叛乱事件表现了特别的兴趣。它们以显著地位刊登了大量根据它们需要而精心加以挑选和编辑的电讯。从这些报纸上可以看到如下的完全歪曲事情真相的报道：“目前骚扰的直接原因是中国政府要达赖喇嘛不带自己通常的随从到北京去的命令”（“战斗报”、“政治报”）；中国政府“企图逮捕达赖喇嘛”（“战斗报”、“政治报”）；“在拉萨发生了反对中国占领军和管理者的起义”（“解放报”）；“中国当局正在愈益破坏和压缩”给予西藏的“某些自治权”（“战斗报”、“政治报”）等等。
