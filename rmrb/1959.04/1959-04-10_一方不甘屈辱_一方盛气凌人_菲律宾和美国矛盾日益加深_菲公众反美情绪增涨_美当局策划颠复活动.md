    This newspaper reports that as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meets in Wellington, the conflict between the Philippines, one of the organization's only three Asian member states, and the United States continues to develop.

    After returning home for lengthy consultations with Washington authorities, U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Bohlen returned to the Philippines in late February and began negotiations with the Philippine government on disputed issues between the two countries. Negotiations have been conducted in secret for more than a month. According to Philippine newspapers, the negotiations encountered significant obstacles on the first item on the agenda—revising the U.S.-Philippine military base agreement. This is because the United States stubbornly refuses to abandon its original plan on the issue of jurisdiction. The United States insists on only recognizing the Philippines' jurisdiction over "off-duty" U.S. military personnel who commit crimes within the base, while the right to determine whether someone is "on-duty" ultimately belongs to the commander of the U.S. military base. In other words, Americans will still decide whether or not to stand trial.

    The U.S.-Philippine military base agreement is an unequal treaty imposed on the Philippines by the United States. Proposals submitted in the Philippine Senate require: the implementation of Philippine law on U.S. bases; Philippine courts to have jurisdiction over all criminal cases on the bases; recognition of the Philippines' rights over resources within the base area; and the United States must obtain the Philippines' consent before using these bases for combat. Judging from the arrogant attitude of the United States in the negotiations, which disregards Philippine sovereignty, the United States has no intention of considering these Philippine demands at all. Therefore, after the news spread, public opinion in the Philippines from all walks of life was extremely indignant. In late March, fifteen members of parliament from the ruling party and the opposition jointly submitted a proposal advocating the safeguarding of Philippine sovereignty over U.S. military bases within the country. The Speaker of the Senate and many senators expressed their support for this proposal. On March 27, a group of influential parliamentarians launched a movement to eliminate the unequal phenomena in the existing U.S.-Philippine treaties.

    Recently, U.S. and Philippine officials have both stated that the base negotiations "have entered the final stage." However, even if the base negotiations come to an end, many other contentious issues between the U.S. and the Philippines will be brought up one by one. There are still many proposals pending in both houses of the Philippine Congress, such as requests to abolish the so-called "Parity Rights Amendment," which allows U.S. monopoly capital to completely control the economic lifeline of the Philippines; and requests to revise the U.S.-Philippine trade agreement, which allows the United States to dump goods into the Philippines. On April 4, Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano reviewed U.S.-Philippine trade relations, saying: Our more than 50 years of connection with the U.S. market has not been beneficial to our country. On April 6, Philippine Congressman Noel Sosa delivered a speech in the House of Representatives. He said that Filipinos have recognized the following facts about Philippine-U.S. relations: U.S. economic assistance is not only insufficient and inadequate but also comes with conditions; the Philippines' legitimate claims for compensation from the United States have not been resolved; and some U.S. expatriates in the Philippines have begun to launch a smear campaign against the Philippines.

    The growing nationalism within the Philippines has caused unease in Washington. The propaganda machine controlled by the United States has wantonly slandered so-called "extreme nationalists," claiming that nationalism is a "minority sentiment." Philippine politicians have resolutely refuted this. Philippine Senator Edmundo Cea believes that nationalist sentiment is entirely legitimate, saying: "The Philippine nationalist movement is aroused by the belief of the Filipino people that they have an obligation and a right to control their economy, and they should rely on themselves rather than on foreigners to restore their economy." Prominent Senator Retoke also retorted, saying: Nationalism "is not a minority sentiment, but almost the sentiment of the entire nation."

    On the one hand, the U.S. authorities continue to implement a set of colonial master's coercive policies, refusing to concede to the demands made by the Philippine public, while at the same time secretly stepping up the planning of subversive activities. Not long ago, the Philippine government uncovered the "Anderson-Fil-American Guerrilla Comrades Association" subversive case. On April 7, the "Manila Chronicle" reported that a Philippine congressman condemned certain U.S. groups for funding the opposition to overthrow the current Philippine government.

    The development of U.S.-Philippine contradictions has become a prominent event in the contradictions between Asian member states and the United States and other imperialist countries within the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. On April 5, a dispatch from United Press International revealed: "The United States and the Philippines have apparently had another disagreement—a disagreement over the future of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." It seems that U.S.-Philippine contradictions will continue to develop.

    一方不甘屈辱　一方盛气凌人
    菲律宾和美国矛盾日益加深
    菲公众反美情绪增涨　美当局策划颠复活动
    本报讯　在东南亚条约组织理事会在惠灵顿开会的时候，这个组织仅有的三个亚洲成员国之一的菲律宾同美国的矛盾，继续在发展着。
    美国驻菲律宾大使波伦在返国同华盛顿当局进行长期磋商后，2月下旬回到菲律宾，同菲律宾政府开始就两国争执的问题举行谈判。近一个多月来谈判一直在秘密进行。据菲律宾报纸透露，谈判在第一项议程上——修改美菲军事基地协定问题上就遇到很大的障碍。因为美国在裁判权问题上死不肯放弃原来的方案。美国主张只承认菲律宾对在基地内犯罪的“非值勤”的美国军人有审判权，而最后确定是否“在值勤”的权利属于美军基地的司令官。这也就是说，还是要由美国人来决定是否去受审。
    美菲军事基地协定是美国强加在菲律宾身上的一个不平等条约。菲律宾参议院里提出的提案要求：在美国基地上实施菲律宾的法律；菲律宾法院对基地上的一切犯罪案件有审判权；承认菲律宾对基地范围内的资源的权利；美国利用这些基地作战时必须征得菲律宾的同意等。从美国在谈判中坚持那种无视菲律宾主权的蛮横态度来看，美国根本不想考虑菲律宾的这些要求。因此，消息传出后，菲律宾的各界舆论异常激愤。3月下旬，执政党和反对党的十五名议员联名提出提案，主张维护菲律宾对本国境内美军基地的主权。参议院的议长和许多议员纷纷表示支持这个提案。3月27日，一批有势力的议员，展开了一个消除现行美菲各项条约中的不平等现象的运动。
    日前，美菲官方人士都表示基地谈判“已经进入最后阶段”。但是，即便基地谈判告一段落，美菲两国间的其它许多争执问题，还将一个一个地提上议程。现在菲律宾国会两院里还摆着不少的提案，如要求废除使美国垄断资本得以完全控制菲律宾经济命脉的所谓“平等权利法”；要求修改使美国得以向菲律宾倾销商品的美菲贸易协定，等等。4月4日，菲律宾外交部长塞兰诺回顾美菲贸易关系说：我们同美国市场有了五十多年的联系，这并不利于我们的国家。4月6日，菲律宾众议员努埃尔·索萨在众议院发表演说。他说，菲律宾人已经认识到菲美关系方面的下列事实：美国的经济援助不仅是不充分和不够的，而且附有条件；菲律宾对美国提出的合法赔偿要求一直没有得到解决；某些旅菲美侨已经开始发动对菲律宾进行诽谤的运动。
    菲律宾国内日益增长的民族主义情绪，已引起了华盛顿的不安。美国的御用宣传机器大肆辱骂所谓“极端民族主义者”，并说什么民族主义是“少数人情绪”。对此，菲律宾的政界人士坚决地加以驳斥。菲律宾参议员埃德蒙多·塞亚认为民族主义情绪是完全正当的，他说：“菲律宾民族主义运动，是菲律宾人民的这样一种信念所激起的，这个信念是，他们有义务和权利来控制他们的经济，他们应当依靠自己而不是依靠外国人来恢复他们的经济。”著名参议员雷托克也反驳说：民族主义“这不是少数人的情绪，而几乎是全国人民的情绪。”
    美国当局一方面仍然执行一套宗主国的高压政策，不肯向菲律宾公众提出的要求让步，同时在暗中加紧策划颠复活动。不久前，菲律宾政府破获了“安德逊菲美游击同志会”颠复案。4月7日“马尼拉纪事报”报道，菲律宾的一个众议员谴责美国某些团体正在资助反对派来推翻菲律宾目前的政府。
    美菲矛盾的发展，已成为东南亚条约组织内部亚洲成员国同美国及其它帝国主义国家的矛盾中的突出事件。4月5日，合众国际社的一则电讯透露：“美国和菲律宾显然又发生了另外一个分歧——对东南亚条约组织前途问题的分歧。”看来，美菲矛盾还将继续发展。
