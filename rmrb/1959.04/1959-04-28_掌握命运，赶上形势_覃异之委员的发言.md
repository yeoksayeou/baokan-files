Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Work Report at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, and the report made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    Our current meeting is convened under the circumstances of the all-round Great Leap Forward in our socialist construction and the unprecedented great unity of the people of the whole country. A more beautiful, more comprehensive, and more magnificent prospect of a continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, even better than 1958, is unfolding before us. I am willing to contribute my strength to realize this beautiful prospect.

    **You cannot master the weapons of Marxism-Leninism without discarding the baggage of bourgeois ideology**

    I deeply feel proud to be a Chinese person in the era of Mao Zedong! In order to better serve the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, I believe that it is necessary to strengthen self-transformation, master one's own destiny, and catch up with the development of the current situation. Thanks to the Party's great united front policy, I, a member of the upper strata of the reactionary ruling class, was able to transfer to the ranks of the people. Furthermore, due to the Party's patient education, through social practice and theoretical study, I have initially come to understand the laws of social development and the principles of class struggle, thereby recognizing my past reactionary nature and increasingly feeling the need for thorough self-transformation. My process of understanding is also a process of repeated self-struggle in my thinking. Taking the two most fundamental of the six political criteria as an example, namely, the attitude towards the leadership of the Communist Party and the path of socialism. Before the anti-Rightist struggle, I also believed that supporting the leadership of the Communist Party and taking the socialist road were requirements of objective laws of development, and there should be no doubt about this. It seemed that these two criteria should be no problem for me. But this was not the case. When the Rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, proposing the fallacy that there were "walls" and "ditches" between the Party and non-Party members, it resonated with me. The so-called "walls and ditches" of the Rightists were essentially manifestations of class contradictions. Similarly, when the Rightists used the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" to confront the Party, not only did I not see that this was a struggle between the proletarian dictatorship and anti-proletarian dictatorship, but I also thought it was socialist democracy. Likewise, because I had serious bourgeois democratic ideas, I could not see that the reactionary arguments put forward by the Rightists, such as "political design institute," "rehabilitation committee," and "fixed interest is not exploitation," were a struggle between two roads with antagonistic natures. I regarded these as issues of the Hundred Schools of Thought contending. This fully proves that if a bourgeois or bourgeois intellectual does not transform their position and dig out the old roots of bourgeois ideology, it is impossible to master the weapons of Marxism-Leninism. Even if they have learned some Marxist-Leninist terms, once they encounter specific problems, it is impossible to analyze them from a class perspective, and even use Marxist-Leninist phrases as decorations for their own reactionary ideas. This is the most profound lesson I learned in the anti-Rightist struggle! Of course, learning Marxist-Leninist knowledge is helpful for ideological transformation, but it does not mean that this is transformation. I deeply realize that the transformation of the political stance of a bourgeois or bourgeois intellectual must be based on a certain degree of ideological transformation, and the transformation of the political stance must take precedence over ideological transformation. It is not difficult to understand that the transformation of the political stance plays a promoting role in ideological transformation, but only through ideological transformation can the transformation of the political stance be consolidated.

    **Confide in the Party, comb through ideological pigtails, formulate self-transformation plans, and delve into ideological revolution**

    Chairman Mao told us that we should use the arrow of Marxism-Leninism to shoot the target of the Chinese revolution. Applying this principle to self-transformation means using the arrow of Marxism-Leninism to shoot the target of our own thinking. Therefore, I believe that correctly understanding oneself, that is, using a class perspective to make a correct analysis of one's own ideology and work style, is an important basis for self-transformation. Just as we did in the rectification movement, through confiding in the Party, combing through ideological pigtails, and formulating self-transformation plans, this is a process of gradually deepening self-understanding, and it is also a process of self-ideological struggle. In this series of movements, I found a starting point for self-transformation. Now the problem is very clear, that is, the contradiction between my existing bourgeois ideology and work style and the socialist system. If this contradiction is not resolved, it will be impossible to master my own destiny. We all know that the anti-Rightist struggle and the all-people rectification movement are aimed at resolving the contradiction between the political stance and ideology of the bourgeoisie and the socialist economic base. This is a sharp class struggle on the political and ideological fronts. This includes two types of contradictions with different natures: antagonistic and non-antagonistic. The mistakes I made when the Rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party reflected the serious problems with my position. Judging from the class roots, historical roots, and ideological roots of my mistakes, they cannot be resolved by a single movement. If this form of error is resolved, another form of error may be committed under other conditions. Because if the inevitability of class contradictions is not resolved, it will be exposed through various accidental events. This also shows the repetitive and arduous nature of ideological transformation, and it is necessary to have the determination of long-term self-transformation to thoroughly transform. Precisely because of this, ideological transformation must be effective through the mass line. The idea of ​​thinking behind closed doors cannot solve the problem. On this point, I was most profoundly inspired during my studies at the Socialist Academy. The education of the Socialist Academy is based on the principles of "consciousness, voluntariness, and freedom," and adopts the method of "self-transformation and mutual education," which is carried out through the form of criticism and self-criticism. Each study unit must go through the release of big-character posters, and then conduct debates in groups and conferences, and finally the leaders or teachers of the academy will make a summary report. I think this is really a fast, good, and economical education method. Since adopting this set of learning methods, the students have gradually realized the benefits of "unity, criticism, unity," and their ideological level has been significantly improved. At the same time, according to the physical strength of the students, under voluntary circumstances, they gradually established labor viewpoints through forms such as labor, light labor, and visiting labor. Some students said: "This is beneficial to both thought and health." It can be seen that the policy of combining education with productive labor is also applicable to older people. In addition, combining each study unit with visits is also the method that students feel is most rewarding. Therefore, I believe that participating in political school studies is also one of the main ways for democratic people to strengthen self-transformation.

    **The Party's mass line working method has generated tremendous power among the masses**

    Recently, I went to Guangdong for inspection. Guangdong's industry and agriculture have doubled in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. I saw that the vast majority of leading cadres at all levels went deep into the masses and personally directed the production front. The soaring enthusiasm of the masses is touching! They implemented the Party's policies and policies through cadres' conferences at the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels. The Party's mass line working method has generated tremendous power among the masses. A situation of "both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and individual ease of mind and lively and vigorous" is forming. What particularly moved me was the hard work spirit of many demobilized officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the production front, which played an inspiring role among the masses. Seeing their selfless communist style of labor, compared with my own bourgeois selfish and self-interested thinking, I not only felt ashamed, but also felt ashamed! Asking myself: For the prosperity of the motherland, for the happiness of future generations, and for mastering my own destiny, can't I still bear to throw away this stinky bourgeois baggage?

    The Party's united front policy has brought me a new political life, and the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming old intellectuals has opened my eyes and taught me how to behave. Before I was aware, the Party patiently waited for me. When I showed a little progress, the Party encouraged me. When I encountered difficulties, the Party promptly helped and cared for me. During the frenzied attack of the Rightists, I once lost my way, and the Party promptly rescued me. The phrase "being selfless and impartial" was a guise for the reactionary ruling class to cover up their crimes in the old society. Today, I have only realized the true meaning of being selfless and impartial from my relationship with the Party. Therefore, I am increasingly feeling the warmth of the Party!

    History has long proven that only the Communist Party can lead the Chinese nation to get rid of the situation of being oppressed and enslaved, and only the Communist Party can lead the 650 million Chinese people to change from poor to rich and from weak to strong. The Party is the embodiment of the interests of the people of the whole country, and it is also the concentration of the wisdom of the people of the whole country. The Party and the people of the whole country are connected by flesh and blood. Any individual or organization will lose its way if it leaves the Party, and relying on the Party will have the strength to overcome all difficulties. Only by linking one's own destiny with the destiny of the Party can one master one's own destiny. This requires thorough self-transformation. Only through thorough self-transformation can we achieve sharing the same fate and breathing the same breath with the Party. Under the leadership of the Party, our country is leaping forward to the great goal of communism at a speed of "one day equals twenty years." The communist ideology and work style are emerging more and more widely among the working people. In the face of this favorable situation, and with the education of the Party and the help of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, I am confident that I will achieve a complete victory in the struggle for self-transformation.

    My political life was given by the Party, and I will dedicate my future life to the Party and to the great cause of socialism!

    Finally, I wish the conference success and wish all committee members good health!

### 掌握命运，赶上形势  覃异之委员的发言

专栏：

    掌握命运，赶上形势
    覃异之委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的工作报告，李维汉副主席代表中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会所作的报告。
    我们这次的会议，是在我国社会主义建设全面大跃进，和全国人民空前大团结的形势下召开的。我们面前正展开着比一九五八年更好更全面更宏伟的一九五九年继续大跃进的美景。我愿为实现这一美景贡献自己的力量。
    不丢掉资产阶级思想的包袱就不能掌握马列主义的武器
    我深深感到做一个毛泽东时代的中国人而自豪！为了更好的为社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业服务，我认为必须加强自我改造，掌握自己命运，以赶上当前形势的发展。由于党的伟大的统一战线政策，使我这样一个反动统治阶级的上层分子，能够转到人民的行列中来，又由于党的耐心教育，通过社会实践和理论学习，使我初步懂得社会发展规律和阶级斗争的道理，从而认识自己过去的反动本质，越来越感觉到有彻底自我改造的必要。我的认识过程，也是思想上反复自我斗争的过程。以六条政治标准中最根本的两条来说，即对于共产党的领导和走社会主义道路的态度。在反右派斗争以前，我也认为拥护共产党的领导，走社会主义的道路是客观发展规律的要求，对此不应有所怀疑，好像这两条标准对我来说，应该无问题了，其实不然，当右派向党猖狂进攻，提出党与非党之间有“墙”有“沟”的谬论时，我却起了共鸣，而右派所谓“墙沟”，实质是阶级矛盾的表现。又如右派利用“长期共存、互相监督”的方针向党分庭抗礼时，我不但没有看出，这是无产阶级专政与反无产阶级专政的斗争，而且还认为这是社会主义的民主。同样，由于我有严重的资产阶级民主的思想，对于右派提出的“政治设计院”，“平反委员会”，“定息不是剥削”等反动的论点，就不可能看出这是敌我性质的两条道路的斗争。我把这些都看成是百家争鸣的问题，这充分证明，一个资产阶级或资产阶级知识分子，如果不改造立场，挖掉资产阶级思想的老根，要想掌握马列主义的武器是不可能的。虽然学了一些马列主义的名词，一旦遇到具体问题，就不可能运用阶级观点来进行分析，甚至把马列主义的词句作为自己反动思想的装饰品。这是在反右斗争中给我最深刻的教训！当然，学马列主义的知识，对于思想改造是有帮助的，但不等于这就是改造了。我深深体会到，一个资产阶级或资产阶级知识分子，政治立场的改造，必须有一定的思想改造为基础，而政治立场的改造又必须优先于思想改造，不难理解，政治立场的改造对思想改造是起推动作用的，但必须经过思想改造，政治立场的改造才能巩固下来。
    向党交心，梳思想辫子，订自我改造规划，深入思想革命
    毛主席告诉我们，要以马列主义之矢，射中国革命之的，把这个道理用到自我改造来，就是用马列主义之矢射自己思想之的。因此，我认为，正确地认识自己，也就是运用阶级观点对自己的思想作风作正确的分析，是自我改造的重要根据。正如我们在整风运动中所做的那样，通过向党交心、梳思想辫子、订自我改造规划等，这是自我认识逐步深化的过程，同时也是自我思想斗争的过程。在这一系列的运动中，我找到了自我改造的下手处。现在问题是很清楚的，就是我所存在的资产阶级思想作风与社会主义制度的矛盾，这个矛盾不解决，就不可能掌握自己的命运。我们都知道，反右派斗争和全民整风运动，就是要解决资产阶级的政治立场和意识形态与社会主义经济基础的矛盾。这是政治战线和思想战线上一场尖锐的阶级斗争。这中间包含着对抗性与非对抗性两种不同性质的矛盾。在右派向党猖狂进攻时我所犯的错误，反映了我存在着严重的立场问题。从我犯错误的阶级根源、历史根源、思想根源来看，绝不是一次运动所能解决的。这个形式的错误解决了，在另一种条件下可能又犯另一个形式的错误。因为阶级矛盾的必然性不解决，它将通过各种偶然性暴露出来。这也说明思想改造的反复性和艰巨性，必须有长期自我改造的决心才能彻底改造过来。正因为这样，所以思想改造必须通过群众路线才能收效，那种闭门思过的想法是不能解决问题的。关于这一点，我在社会主义学院学习中，受到最深刻的启示。社会主义学院的教育，是以“自觉、自愿、自由”的原则为基础，采取“自我改造，互相教育”的办法，通过批评与自我批评的形式来进行。每个学习单元，都要经过大字报的鸣放，然后在小组和大会上进行辩论，最后由学院的领导或教师做总结报告。我认为这实在是多快好省的教育方法。自从采取这一套学习方法以后，同学们逐渐体会“团结、批评、团结”的好处，思想水平显著提高了。同时根据同学们体力的强弱，在自愿的情形下，分别通过劳动、轻微劳动、参观劳动等形式逐步建立劳动观点，有的同学说：“这对思想与健康两有益处”。由此可见，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，对于年龄较大的人，同样是适用的。此外，结合每一学习单元，进行参观，这也是同学们感到收获最大的办法。因此，我认为参加政治学校学习也是民主人士加强自我改造主要途径之一。
    党的群众路线的工作方法已在群众中产生巨大力量
    最近我曾到广东视察，广东省的工农业，在一九五八年的大跃进中翻了一番，我看到各级领导干部，绝大多数都深入群众中去，亲到生产战线上指挥，群众的冲天干劲，令人感动！他们通过四级、五级、六级等的干部大会来贯彻党的方针政策，党的群众路线的工作方法，已在群众中产生了巨大的力量。正在形成“既有集中，又有民主，既有纪律，又有自由，既有统一的意志，又有个人心情舒畅，生动活泼”的局面。特别使我受感动的是许多转业的解放军官兵，他们在生产战线上的苦干精神，在群众中起了鼓舞作用。看到他们那种忘我劳动的共产主义的风格，与自己资产阶级自私自利的思想相比，不仅觉得惭愧，而且觉得可耻！扪心自问：为了祖国的富强，为了子孙万代的幸福，为了掌握自己的命运，难道我还舍不得丢掉这个资产阶级的臭包袱吗？
    党的统战政策给我带来新的政治生命，党对旧知识分子的团结教育改造政策，给我打开眼界，知道如何做人。在我未觉悟之前，党耐心的等待我，在我稍有进步表现时，党就鼓舞我，当我遇到困难时，党及时的帮助我关怀我，在右派猖狂进攻中，我一度迷失方向，党又及时地挽救我。“大公无私”这句话，在旧社会是反动统治阶级掩盖罪恶的幌子，今天我从对党的关系中才体会到大公无私的真实意义。因而也越来越感到党的温暖！
    历史早已证明，只有共产党才能领导中华民族，摆脱被压迫被奴役的境地，也只有共产党才能领导六亿五千万中国人民由穷变富，由弱变强。党是全国人民利益的体现者，也是全国人民智慧的集中者，党和全国人民是血肉相连的。任何个人或组织，离开了党就会迷失方向，依靠党就有力量克服一切困难。只有把自己的命运和党的命运联系起来，才能掌握自己的命运。这就需要彻底地进行自我改造。只有彻底地自我改造，才能做到与党共命运、同呼吸。我们国家在党的领导下，正以“一天等于二十年”的速度，向共产主义的伟大目标飞跃前进。共产主义的思想作风，正在劳动人民中，日益广阔地涌现出来，面对这种有利的形势，又有党的教育和民革组织的帮助，我有信心在自我改造的斗争中，取得彻底的胜利。
    我的政治生命是党所给的，我将把我今后的生命贡献给党，贡献给社会主义的伟大事业！
    最后，祝大会成功，祝各位委员健康！
