The separation and antagonism between mental and manual labor emerged alongside the division and antagonism of classes

Labor is the use of labor power, the state of labor power acting on nature. Labor power is the sum of various physical and mental abilities existing in the human body. When people transform natural objects into useful objects, they use this labor power.

In the early days of humanity, primitive people relied on simple and crude tools to hunt or gather animals and plants from nature for sustenance. Because the productive forces at that time were very rudimentary, there was no surplus product, and the practice of engaging in mental labor exclusively, detached from manual labor, could not occur. Later, as productive forces developed slightly and a surplus product began to emerge, and as a matriarchal clan divided into many sub-clans, many public affairs within the clan needed to be handled, such as armed organizations to defend against attacks from other clans, internal management of irrigation, production and distribution, conflict resolution, religious sacrifices, magic, healing, and a series of other matters. These required someone to do. Those who performed these tasks were jointly elected by all members of the clan and only held these positions temporarily, not completely detached from manual labor. As productive forces continued to develop, the surplus product increased, and the clan further divided into many families. Patriarchal system replaced the matriarchal system, and each family acquired some private property. Feeling the shortage of labor power, war captives were distributed to each family, thus forming domestic slavery and the initial distinction between slaves and masters. On the other hand, with the division of labor between animal husbandry and agriculture, there also occurred a division of labor between agriculture and handicrafts. Consequently, the profession of commerce emerged. Exchange initially took place between clans, and later within clans as well. Commerce corrupted clan society, and increasing private property became the goal of people's pursuit. Land that was previously periodically allocated to families for use later became the private property of each family. The group of people who were previously elected by the clan to hold public office later became hereditary. These people holding public office used their special power to expand their private property. From then on, a great divergence occurred in the private property of each family within the clan. Due to the prevalence of land mortgages and interest-bearing loans, the poor became slaves of the rich because they could not repay their debts. Thus, society was divided into two major classes, masters and slaves, and human history entered the era of slave society. At the same time, with the division and antagonism of classes, the separation of mental and manual labor, which was previously only in its embryonic stage, transformed into the antagonism between the two. From then on, mental labor became the prerogative of the exploiting class, while manual labor was exclusively borne by the exploited class. The entire history of class society is a history of the antagonism between mental labor and manual labor.

In slave society, the slave-owning class generally participated in the public affairs of ruling the slave class, and a class of intellectuals belonging to this class emerged in particular. "Knowledge requires necessary leisure." These intellectuals were supported entirely by slaves and became the idle class. They had ample time to engage in the study of philosophy, science, literature, art, etc., thus creating the brilliant culture of ancient times (entirely irrigated by the blood and sweat of slaves). As for the slaves, they were regarded as mere talking tools, engaged in heavy manual labor year-round under the whips of their masters, and never had the opportunity to improve their intelligence. This antagonism between mental and manual labor was simply the antagonism between the exploiters and the exploited.

In feudal society, the antagonism between the landlord class and the peasant class was expressed as the antagonism between "those who labor with their minds" and "those who labor with their strength." "' Those who labor with their minds' govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others." "'Those that govern others are fed by others, and those governed by others feed others.'" This fully illustrates that the relationship between mental laborers and manual laborers is one of exploiters and exploited. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "In China, only the landlords have culture, and the peasants have no culture. But the landlord's culture is created by the peasants, because what creates the landlord's culture is nothing other than the blood and sweat extracted from the peasants." (See "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan")

In capitalist society, with the deepening of class contradictions, the antagonism between mental and manual labor reached an unprecedented height. All the research of the bourgeois intellectuals in philosophy, natural science, and humanities became tools for the bourgeoisie to strengthen its rule and exploitation over the proletariat. The proletariat became mere attachments to the machine, monotonously and mechanically repeating the same operations. Such manual labor became the drudgery of the workers, and they could not and did not want to exert any creativity. The bourgeois intellectuals actually became enemies of the working class. As Stalin pointed out, under the capitalist system, workers treat factory directors, managers, engineers, and other technical personnel as if they were their enemies. In the thousands of years of class society, the ruling class and its intellectuals, in order to consolidate the rule of their class, deliberately portrayed manual labor as base and mental labor as noble. In addition, they also said that mental laborers are the embodiment of spirit and manual laborers are the embodiment of matter, and that spirit is higher than matter and precedes matter (this is one of the roots of the idealism of the exploiting class). Therefore, despising and demeaning manual labor became a traditional bad habit of all exploiting classes.

The Combination of Mental and Manual Labor is the Law of Social Development

Socialist society is a new society established by the working people under the leadership of the Communist Party after overthrowing all systems and classes of exploitation. The working people are the masters of their own affairs, and they must use their own labor to build socialism and transition to communism. Labor has become a glorious and heroic undertaking. Since the founding of the People's Republic, the workers in factories and mines have demonstrated their enthusiasm and creativity in labor, improved labor productivity, and put forward countless rationalization proposals based on their own experience. They have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, carried out technological innovations, and created new machines, manufactured many products that our country did not have before, and many engineers, technicians, and model workers have emerged. This shows that the reason why workers can exert such creative labor is the result of combining their developed intelligence and physical strength. Secondly, after the peasants embarked on the socialist road, their enthusiasm for labor soared to unprecedented heights. They worked hard and skillfully, created many miracles, and produced many experts and model workers. Under the guidance of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture (water, fertilizer, soil, seed, close planting, plant protection, tools, and management), they created new agricultural production technologies, thus obtaining the unprecedented bumper harvest of 1958. This also shows that the reason why peasants can exert such creative labor is the result of combining their developed intelligence and physical strength. In recent years, the broad masses of workers and peasants have universally studied culture, science, technology, and philosophy, written poems and articles. Their intelligence will inevitably gradually improve, and their labor productivity will also continue to increase. This marks that mental labor and manual labor will be combined at a high level. At present, the people's communes have been established in our country's rural areas. Each people's commune will universally establish schools at all levels. The children of the working people will study from primary school to middle school, and even graduate from university, in a combination of work and study. Everyone will be a mental laborer and a manual laborer. Everyone can be a philosopher, scientist, writer, and artist. By that time, mental labor and manual labor will be combined at a high level, and society will enter the communist era.

From this, it can be seen that the combination of mental and manual labor is the law of social development.

Concrete Ways to Gradually Eliminate the Differences Between Mental and Manual Labor in Our Country

At the current stage, there are still some bourgeois elements (including their intellectuals) and some educated youth in our country whose mental labor has not yet been combined with manual labor. There are also working cadres (including original revolutionary cadres) who have either never participated in productive labor or have been separated from productive labor for a long time. They must also participate in manual labor in order to combine it with their mental labor. To this end, the Party Central Committee issued a decision on cadres taking turns to participate in labor at the grassroots level. In terms of school education, the Party also put forward the training goal of "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture" and formulated the educational policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combining with productive labor." These policies, decisions, and training goals are aimed at taking certain measures to gradually narrow the gap between mental and manual labor and even to combine the two. However, when the Party Central Committee's policies and decisions were issued, bourgeois elements and some educated youth, clinging to the bad habits of the old era of despising and demeaning labor, held resistance, especially some educated youth, who voiced many opinions, such as: "If we have to be ordinary laborers after graduating from university, why bother studying and then laboring?" Another said: "Farmers have no knowledge. Going to the countryside to labor won't teach you anything." Another said: "In the communist era, there will still be a need for someone to tackle cutting-edge science and invent and create. This shows that mental labor and manual labor will still be separate then." Another said: "In the communist era, manual labor will not exist, and only mental labor will exist." These absurd and bizarre arguments are nothing more than excuses for disliking labor and avoiding labor.

As everyone knows, if we want to build socialism and transition to communism, we must develop productive forces at a high speed and achieve a high degree of industrialization and agricultural electrification and mechanization. This requires many people with a fairly high level of culture to engage in labor in this area in order to be competent. Those who do not study and have no culture are not competent.

Secondly, Chairman Mao has already criticized the idea that farmers are disliked for not having knowledge and that nothing can be learned from laboring in the countryside. He said: "There are many intellectuals who think they are very knowledgeable and put on airs of knowledge, but they do not know that these airs are bad, harmful, and hindering their progress. They should know a truth, that many so-called intellectuals are actually the most unknowledgeable, and sometimes workers and peasants have more knowledge than they do." (See "Rectify the Party's Style of Work") The knowledge of workers and peasants is sometimes indeed more than that of intellectuals, as can be testified by any intellectual who has ever worked and been tempered in factories and villages.

Again, the new people of the communist era are "multi-skilled" people trained under the condition of combining work and study. They have a high level of scientific and cultural knowledge, understand the entire production process, and can engage in both manual labor and mental labor. As for who will tackle cutting-edge science and invent and create, it will be allocated by the planning agencies according to the special expertise of each person, and those who are decided to do this kind of work will not be completely detached from manual labor either. Some people imagine: at that time, everyone will do their best, and everyone will choose mental labor. Who will engage in manual labor? This idea is incorrect. Although communist society has no state (the state's external functions still exist when the capitalist encirclement still exists), the organization of society and the system of planning agencies are very strict. The labor power of all members of society is uniformly allocated and comprehensively arranged by the organization. Members of society with a high degree of communist moral character completely obey the allocation of the organization. In such a society, manual labor and mental labor are combined at a high level, and the phenomenon of engaging in mental labor exclusively without engaging in manual labor is impossible.

Finally, it must be said that in the communist era, manual labor will still exist. The statement that "manual labor does not exist, and only mental labor exists" is incorrect. Manual labor is the foundation for the development of mental labor. Without creative manual labor, people's physical and intellectual strength cannot develop harmoniously, and they cannot acquire various scientific knowledge about the objective world. Therefore, there is no question of inventions and creations in science and technology. In that era, manual labor still exists. The difference is that it has gotten rid of its cumbersome nature and is combined with a high degree of mental labor. As Engels put it, in the communist era, "productive labor provides each person with the possibility of fully developing and exercising all his physical and intellectual abilities. It is no longer a means of enslaving people, but a means of liberating people. Therefore, productive labor changes from a heavy burden into a pleasure." ("Anti-Dühring")

The trend of mental labor and manual labor shifting from separation to combination is an inevitable trend in the development of socialist society. At present, the relationship between mental labor and manual labor is no longer one of exploitation and being exploited, and the antagonism between the two has disappeared, but they are still at a distance. The measures taken by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao regarding cadres and students participating in productive labor are precisely aimed at gradually shortening the distance between mental labor and manual labor and making the two tend to combine. Now, all universities and middle schools across the country stipulate that students participate in two to four months of productive labor each year, and some schools have also implemented a combination of work and study. Judging from this trend, graduates of all levels of schools will become educated laborers in the future. On the other hand, the broad masses of workers and peasants will also become educated laborers due to the popularization and improvement of culture. Educated laborers throughout the country engaging in productive labor can greatly improve labor productivity and accelerate the process of high industrialization and agricultural electrification and mechanization, and thus accelerate the process of building socialism and transitioning to communism. There is no doubt about this.

    脑力劳动和体力劳动从分离必然走向结合
    李达
    随着阶级的分裂和对立，脑力劳动和体力劳动萌芽状态的分离也对立起来
    劳动是劳动力的使用，是劳动力作用于自然的状态，劳动力即是劳动能力，是存在于人类肉体中的种种物理的精神的能力的总和，当人们改造自然物为有用物的时候，就使用这种劳动力。
    在人类的初期时代，原始人利用简单粗糙的工具猎取或采集自然界的动植物为生，因为当时的生产力非常幼稚，没有剩余产物，那种脱离体力劳动而专做脑力劳动的事情是不能发生的。往后，生产力稍见发展，开始有了剩余产物，同时一个母氏族分化为许多子氏族，于是氏族中许多公共事务就需要有人去做，如对外防御他族袭击的武装组织，对内掌管疏水灌溉、生产和分配、排难解纷、宗教祭祀、魔术、治病等一系列的事情，需要有人去做，做这类事的人是由氏族全体人员共同推选的，并且他们也只是暂时担任这类工作，还不是完全脱离体力劳动的。随着生产力向前发展，剩余产物多起来了，同时氏族又分化为许多家族，父家长制代替了母家长制，各家族有了一些私有财产。由于感到劳动力的不足，就把战争所得的俘虏分配给各家族，于是形成了家内奴隶制，开始有了奴隶与主人的差别。在另一方面，随着畜牧业与农业的分工，又发生了农业和手工业的分工。于是又有商业这一门行业出现了。交换最初是在氏族与氏族之间进行的，后来也在氏族内部实行了。商业腐蚀了氏族社会，增加私有财产成为人们追逐的目标，从前定期分配给各家族使用的土地，后来也变成各家族的私产了，从前由氏族推举担任公职的一群人，后来变成世袭了。这类担任公职的人，就利用特殊势力来扩大自己的私产。从此，氏族内部各家族的私产发生了很大的分歧。由于土地抵押和利息借贷的流行，穷人负债不能偿还，就沦为富人的奴隶。于是社会分为主人与奴隶两大阶级，人类的历史进到了奴隶制社会的时代，同时，随着阶级的分裂和对立，从前那种只是萌芽状态的脑力劳动和体力劳动的分离，就转变为两者的对立了，从此，脑力劳动成为剥削阶级的特权，而体力劳动就专由被剥削阶级负担了。阶级社会全部的历史是脑力劳动
    和体力劳动对立的历史
    在奴隶制社会中，奴隶主这一阶级，一般地参与统治奴隶阶级的公共事务，特别地产生了属于这个阶级的知识分子。“知识是必要的闲暇。”这类知识分子专靠奴隶养活，成了有闲阶级，他们有充分的时间，去从事哲学、科学、文学、艺术等的研究，因而创造出古代的灿烂的文化（这完全是奴隶的血汗灌溉出来的）。至于奴隶们，则被当作是只能说话的工具，终年在主人们鞭挞之下干着笨重的体力劳动，永远也没有增进智力的机会。这种脑力劳动和体力劳动的对立，简直是剥削者与被剥削者的对立。
    在封建社会中，地主阶级与农民阶级的对立，表现为“劳心者”与“劳力者”的对立。“‘劳心者’治人，劳力者治于人”。“治人者食于人，治于人者食人”，这充分说明了脑力劳动者和体力劳动者的关系是剥削者和被剥削者的关系。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“中国历来只是地主有文化，农民没有文化。可是地主的文化是由农民造成的，因为造成地主文化的东西，不是别的，正是从农民身上掠取的血汗。”（见“湖南农民运动考察报告”）
    到了资本主义社会，随着阶级矛盾的加深，脑力劳动和体力劳动的对立也达到空前的高度。资产阶级知识分子所有关于哲学、自然科学、人文科学的研究，都成为资产阶级加强对于无产阶级的统治和剥削的工具。无产阶级则成为机器的附件，单调地、机械地重复同一的操作。这样的体力劳动，成为工人们的苦役，他们不能也不愿发挥任何创造性。资产阶级知识分子，实际上成了工人阶级的敌人。正如斯大林所指出的，在资本主义制度下，工人对待厂长、经理、工程师及其他技术人员，就好像对待自己的敌人一样。在几千年的阶级社会中，统治阶级及其知识分子，为了巩固自己阶级的统治，有意把体力劳动说成是下贱的，把脑力劳动说成是高贵的。此外，他们还说脑力劳动者是精神的化身，体力劳动者是物质的化身，精神高于物质，先于物质（这是剥削阶级唯心论产生的根源之一）。因此，轻视和贱视体力劳动，就成了一切剥削阶级传统的恶习惯。脑力劳动和体力劳动的结合
    是社会发展的规律
    社会主义社会，是劳动人民在共产党领导下，推翻了一切剥削制度和剥削阶级后建立起来的新社会，劳动人民当家做主，要用自己的劳动建成社会主义，并过渡到共产主义，劳动变成了光荣豪迈的事情。人民共和国成立以来，厂矿的工人们发挥了劳动的积极性和创造性，提高了劳动生产率，他们根据自己的经验，提出了无数合理化建议；他们学习了苏联先进经验，进行技术革新，还创造了新的机器，制造了我国从前所没有的许多产品，并且出现了许多工程师、技师和模范。这表明着工人们所以能够发挥这样的创造性劳动，是他们把发展了的智力和体力相结合的结果。其次，农民们在走上了社会主义道路以后，劳动热情空前高涨，他们苦干实干巧干，创造了许多奇迹，出现了许多专家和模范。他们在水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管八字宪法指导下，创造了新的农业生产技术，因而获得了1958年的空前大丰收。这也表明着农民们所以能够发挥出这样的创造性的劳动，是他们把发展了的智力和体力相结合的结果。近年以来，广大的工农群众，普遍地学文化、学科学、学技术、学哲学，写诗歌、写文章，他们的智力必将逐步提高，他们的劳动生产率也将不断提高。这标志着脑力劳动和体力劳动将在高度的水准上结合起来。目前，我国农村已经人民公社化，各个人民公社都将普遍设立各级学校，劳动人民的子弟都要在半工半读中从小学到中学，直到大学毕业，人人都是脑力劳动者兼体力劳动者，人人都可以做哲学家、科学家、文学家、艺术家，到了那个时候，脑力劳动和体力劳动就在高度水准上结合起来了，社会也就将进到共产主义时代了。
    由此可见，脑力劳动与体力劳动的结合，是社会发展的规律。
    我国逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别的具体途径
    在现阶段，我国还有一些资产阶级分子（包括它的知识分子）和一些知识青年，他们的脑力劳动还没有和体力劳动结合起来。还有工作干部（包括原有的革命干部），他们或者未曾参加过生产劳动，或者脱离生产劳动已久，他们也必须参加体力劳动，以便和他们的脑力劳动结合起来。为此，党中央发布了干部轮流下放参加劳动的决定，在学校教育方面，党也提出了“有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者”这一培养目标；并制定了“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”这一教育方针。这些方针、决定和培养目标，就是采取一定的措施，使脑力劳动和体力劳动逐步缩小距离以至于使两者结合起来。可是当着党中央的方针、决定发出的时候，资产阶级分子和一些知识青年，狃于过去轻视和贱视劳动的旧时代的恶习，抱有抵触情绪，特别是一些知识青年，曾经发出了许多议论，例如说：“大学毕业后还要做普通劳动者，何必读书，然后劳动，”又如说：“农民无知识，下乡劳动，学不到什么。”又如说：“共产主义时代，还需要有人攻尖端科学，发明创造，可见那时脑力劳动和体力劳动还是分离的。”又如说：“共产主义时代，体力劳动不存在，只有脑力劳动存在。”这些奇谈与怪论，无非是厌恶劳动和回避劳动的借口。
    大家知道，我们要建成社会主义并向共产主义过渡，就必须高速度地发展生产力，实现高度工业化和农业电气化、机械化。这就要求很多具有相当高度的文化的人去从事这方面的劳动，才能胜任。那种不读书而无文化的人是不能胜任的。
    其次，那种嫌恶农民没有知识，下乡劳动学不到什么的思想，毛主席早已批评过了。他说：“有许多知识分子，他们自以为很有知识，大摆其知识架子，而不知道这种架子是不好的，是有害的，是阻碍他们前进的。他们应该知道一个真理，就是许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点。”（见“整顿党的作风”）工农分子的知识有时的确比知识分子多一点，凡是曾经下厂下乡劳动锻炼过的知识分子都可以作证。
    再次，共产主义时代的新人，都是在半工半读条件下培养出来的“一专多能”的人，既有高度的科学文化水平，又通晓整个生产的过程，既能从事体力劳动，也能从事脑力劳动。至于什么人去攻尖端科学，去发明创造，则是由计划机关按照各人的特长去调配的，并且被决定做这类工作的人也不是完全脱离体力劳动的。有人设想：那时各尽所能，人人都要选择脑力劳动，谁去从事体力劳动呢？这种想法是不正确的。共产主义社会虽然没有国家（在资本主义的包围还存在的时候，国家的对外职能还存在），而社会的组织和计划机关的系统却是很严密的，社会全体成员的劳动力是由组织统筹分配，全面安排的。具有高度共产主义道德品质的社会成员是完全服从组织的调配的。在这种社会中，体力劳动和脑力劳动是在高度的水准上结合着，那种专搞脑力劳动而不搞体力劳动的现象是不可能有的。
    最后要说的是：在共产主义时代，体力劳动还是存在的，所谓“体力劳动不存在，只有脑力劳动存在”的说法，是不正确的，体力劳动是脑力劳动所以发达的基础，如果没有创造性的体力劳动，人们的体力和智力就不能和谐地发展，就不能获得关于客观世界的各种科学的知识，因而也就谈不上什么科学技术方面的发明和创造。在那个时代，体力劳动还是存在的，所不同的地方是：它已摆脱了笨重的性质，并与高度的脑力劳动结合着，恩格斯说得好，在共产主义时代，“生产劳动供给每人以全面发展并运用自己一切体力智力的可能，它不再是奴役人们的手段，而是解放人们的手段，因此，生产劳动从一种繁重负担变成一种快乐。”（“反杜林论”）
    脑力劳动和体力劳动由分离而趋向结合，这是社会主义社会发展的必然趋势。目前，脑力劳动和体力劳动的关系已不是剥削和被剥削的关系，两者的对立已经消失，但它们仍然是有距离的。党中央和毛主席关于干部和学生参加生产劳动的措施，正是要逐步缩短脑力劳动和体力劳动的距离，并使两者趋向于结合。现在，全国各高等学校和中等学校都规定了学生每年参加两个月到四个月的生产劳动，有的学校还实行了半工半读。从这种趋势看，将来各级学校的毕业生都将成为有文化的劳动者。在另一方面，广大的工人和农民群众，由于文化的普及和提高，也都将成为有文化的劳动者。全国有文化的劳动者从事生产劳动，就可以大大提高劳动生产率，就可以促速国家高度工业化和农业电气化、机械化，因而就可以加快建成社会主义并向共产主义过渡的过程，这是没有疑义的。
