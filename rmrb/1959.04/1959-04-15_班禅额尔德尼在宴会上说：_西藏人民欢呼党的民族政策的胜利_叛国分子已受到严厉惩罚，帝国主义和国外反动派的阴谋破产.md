　　Panchen Erdeni said in his speech at the banquet:
　　The Tibetan People Cheer the Victory of the Party's Ethnic Policies
　　Traitors Have Been Severely Punished, the Conspiracy of Imperialism and Foreign Reactionaries Has Gone Bankrupt
    Panchen Erdeni then gave a speech at the banquet, saying: "Today, at this cordial and joyous grand banquet, I would first like to extend, with immense excitement, on behalf of the Tibetan people, greetings to our beloved leader Chairman Mao and the leading comrades of the Central Committee, and to express our heartfelt gratitude and highest respect to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee for their kind care and guidance.
    "This time, Vice Chairman Apei and other representatives from the Tibetan region attended the first session of the Second National People's Congress and the first session of the Third Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in the capital, Beijing. Along the way, we were warmly welcomed, seen off, and warmly received by leading cadres from local organs and troops, and people from all walks of life. This has once again deeply impressed us with the boundless warmth and meticulous care of the united, mutually-assisting, and friendly big family of the motherland. For this, I express my deep gratitude. "During our trip to the capital, we personally witnessed that, inspired by the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland have entered a great construction period where one day equals twenty years. The communist ideology of the masses of people has been aroused, and on this basis, they have unleashed soaring enthusiasm, promoting our country's socialist cause to leap forward at an unprecedented speed in history. Countless miracles have been created in industrial and agricultural production, cultural and educational undertakings, and the establishment of people's communes and the rapid development of various undertakings of the communes fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the inexhaustible creative power of the people. "Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the wise leadership and kind care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's great ethnic policies, with the joint efforts of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, all staff members, and the Tibetan people, great achievements and development have been made in various works in the Tibetan region. The great Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have thus received the unanimous support and love of the Tibetan people. However, just as the Tibetan people were advancing together with the people of the whole country towards a prosperous and happy socialist society, most of the Kalons and the upper-class reactionary group of the former Tibetan local government, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, openly launched a full-scale armed rebellion in Lhasa, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and openly betrayed the country. These jackals, waving the banner of safeguarding 'national interests' and wearing the cloak of religion, engaged in acts of betraying the motherland, undermining the unity of the motherland and ethnic groups, burning, killing, looting, and endangering the people. These traitors are the scum of the nation and religion, and the public enemy of the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. Their serious crimes of betraying the motherland and betraying the people have already been severely punished by the people. The conspiracy of imperialism and foreign reactionaries has been completely exposed and bankrupt.
    "Now, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the direct leadership of the Tibet Work Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Tibetan people wholeheartedly support the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and quell the rebellion, and are closely working with the People's Liberation Army to continue to wipe out the remaining bandits in other areas. Now, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has exercised the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government and held its first plenary meeting. A new page has been turned in the history of Tibet, and the Tibetan people cheer the great victory of the Party's ethnic policies. We firmly believe that, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the strong support and assistance of the 650 million people of all ethnic groups across the country, the Tibetan people will fundamentally get rid of poverty and backwardness, and together with the people of the whole country, move towards a prosperous and happy socialist society, and enter the glorious ranks of advanced socialist nations."
    Panchen Erdeni finally proposed a toast to the savior of all ethnic groups – the Communist Party of China, to the unity and unification of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and to the longevity of our beloved leader Chairman Mao! A toast to the health of the leading comrades headed by Premier!

    班禅额尔德尼接着在宴会上致词，他说：“今天，在这个亲切欢聚的隆重宴会上，我首先以万分兴奋的心情，代表西藏人民的意愿，向我们敬爱的领袖毛主席和中央各位首长问候，并对毛主席和中央的亲切关怀和教导致以衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    “这次我和阿沛副主任委员以及西藏地区的其他代表，到首都北京出席第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和政协第三届第一次会议，我们在沿途受到了各地机关、部队的领导干部和各界人民的热烈欢迎、欢送和亲切的招待，这使我们又一次深深地感受到了团结、互助、友爱的祖国大家庭的无限温暖和无微不至的关怀，对此我深表感谢。“在我们来首都的途中，亲眼看到祖国各族人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，已经进入了一天等于二十年的伟大建设时期，人民群众的共产主义思想焕发，并在这个基础上，发挥出了冲天的干劲，推动着我国的社会主义事业以历史上从未有过的高速度飞跃地向前发展，工农业生产和文化教育事业等都创造了无数奇迹，人民公社的建立和公社各项事业的迅速发展，这些都充分显示出社会主义制度无比的优越性和人民群众无穷无尽的创造力量。“西藏和平解放以来，在党中央、毛主席的英明领导与亲切关怀下，在党的伟大的民族政策的光辉照耀下，在进藏人民解放军、全体工作人员和西藏人民的共同努力下，西藏地区的各项工作是取得了巨大成就和发展的，从而伟大的共产党和人民解放军受到了西藏人民一致的拥护与爱戴。但是当西藏人民正在和全国人民一道向着繁荣幸福的社会主义社会迈进的时候，原西藏地方政府多数噶伦和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和国外反动派，在拉萨公然掀起全面的武装叛乱，劫持达赖喇嘛，公开叛国，这些打着维护‘民族利益’旗号和披着宗教外衣的豺狼，干着背叛祖国、破坏祖国统一和民族团结、烧杀抢掠、危害人民的勾当，这些叛国分子是民族和宗教的败类，是西藏人民和全国人民的公敌，他们这种背叛祖国、背叛人民的严重罪行，已经受到人民的严厉的惩罚。帝国主义和国外反动派的阴谋已经被彻底戳穿和破产了。
    “现在西藏人民在党中央的正确领导和中共西藏工委的直接领导下，全心全意拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和平息叛乱的命令，正在密切地和人民解放军一起，继续扫荡其他地区的叛匪。现在，西藏自治区筹备委员会已经行使西藏地方政府的职权，并举行了第一次全体会议，西藏的历史已经翻开新的一页，西藏人民欢呼党的民族政策的伟大胜利。我们坚信，在中国共产党的英明领导下，在全国六亿五千万各族人民的大力支援和帮助下，西藏人民一定会从根本上摆脱贫困落后的面貌，和全国人民一道，走向繁荣、幸福的社会主义社会，进入先进的社会主义民族的光荣行列。”
    班禅额尔德尼最后提议，为各族人民的救星--中国共产党，为祖国各族人民的团结和统一，为我们敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆而干杯！为以总理为首的各位首长身体健康而干杯！
