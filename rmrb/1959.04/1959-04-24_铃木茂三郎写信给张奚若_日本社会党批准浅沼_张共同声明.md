Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, received a letter from Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party. The full text is as follows:

Mr. Zhang Xiruo,

Some time ago, when the delegation headed by Secretary-General Asanuma of our party visited your country, it received a warm welcome from you and various related organizations, for which I express my heartfelt gratitude.

In particular, the Asanuma-Zhang Joint Statement was issued amidst the warm welcome of the Chinese people, pointing out the way forward for the people of Japan and China, which fills me with joy. Based on the detailed report made by the delegation within the Japan Socialist Party, the Central Executive Committee formally approved the Joint Statement. We firmly believe that this Joint Statement will bring new progress to the struggle to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China and to strive for our country's independence and peace.

I am now reporting to you the formal decision of our party's Central Executive Committee. The Japan Socialist Party is determined to move forward further based on this Joint Statement, and at the same time deeply appreciates the warm hospitality you extended to the delegation.

I wish for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and wish you good health.

Suzuki Mosaburo
Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party
April 6, 1959
