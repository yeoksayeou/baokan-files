Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said in his speech at the commemorative meeting of the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference held by people from all walks of life in the capital this evening that a few Indian expansionists, even some Indian politicians, disregarding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, openly supported the armed rebellion in Tibet and interfered in China's internal affairs, attempting to separate Tibet from China. This is a complete inheritance of the mantle of British imperialism. Such conspiracies are doomed to fail.

Guo Moruo solemnly warned that in today's era, whoever caters to the wishes of imperialism, betrays the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, betrays the Bandung Spirit, and engages in activities that are detrimental to Asian-African solidarity, will absolutely come to no good end.

In his speech, Guo Moruo said that recently, US imperialism and its servants—modern revisionists and some pro-American reactionary forces in Asian and African countries—have used the Tibet issue to clamor, slanderously accusing our country's suppression of the rebellion as aggression and expansion, and as a violation of the Five Principles, attempting to stir up a counter-current against China and undermine the Five Principles, and to provoke friendly relations between our country and India and Southeast Asian countries. Guo Moruo said that such despicable means by imperialism and foreign reactionaries cannot deceive the eyes and ears of the Asian and African people. Everyone knows that Tibet has been Chinese territory since the 13th century, and the Chinese people suppressing the rebellion in their own territory is purely China's internal affair, and no one can interfere in any form.

On this glorious festival of the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, more than 3,000 people from all walks of life in the capital solemnly held a commemorative meeting at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall this evening, expressing that the 650 million Chinese people are willing to work together with the people of Asian and African countries to safeguard and promote the Bandung Spirit, to strive for further victories in the anti-colonial struggle of the Asian and African people, and to further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries.

The meeting was attended by heads of mass organizations, democratic parties, and relevant departments in Beijing, as well as heads of the China-Indonesia, Iraq, India, Nepal, Burma, UAE, and Pakistan Friendship Associations. They were Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Li Siguang, Li Dequan, Liu Changsheng, Chu Tunan, Liu Geping, Da Punsheng, Luo Jun, Wu Han, Hu Yuzhi, Zhou Jianren, Liang Sicheng, Chen Hansheng, Shao Zonghan, Liu Xiyuan, Hu Qili, and others.

The meeting was presided over by Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee. In his speech, he said that looking back over the past four years, under the mobilization and encouragement of the "Bandung Spirit," the Asian and African people have launched a powerful impact on imperialism and colonialism, achieved great victories, and brought about tremendous changes in the Asian-African situation. The famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles adopted by the Bandung Conference have not only taken root in the hearts of the people in the Asian and African regions, but are also being recognized by more and more countries around the world as the criteria for handling international affairs.

Amid thunderous applause, Guo Moruo took the stage and delivered a long speech. He first excitedly said that in the past four years, the seeds sown by the Bandung Conference have blossomed and borne fruit everywhere on the vast land of Asia and Africa. We are pleased to see that many Asian and African countries that have already achieved independence have achieved a series of victories in the struggle to safeguard national independence and adhere to peaceful neutrality.

Guo Moruo said that the great Bandung Spirit has long transcended regional boundaries and has had an increasingly profound impact on the world, especially Latin America. In recent years, the people of Latin America have achieved a series of major victories in the struggle against American control, safeguarding national independence, and striving for democracy and freedom. These victories cannot but greatly encourage and influence the national liberation struggles of the Asian and African people.

Guo Moruo said that China is a participating country in the Bandung Conference and the initiator of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The mutual support between our people and the people of Asian and African countries in the struggle against imperialist aggression, safeguarding national sovereignty, and striving for national independence has further tested and developed our friendship and solidarity.

Guo Moruo emphasized that while hailing the great victory of the Asian-African national independence movement, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the new aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. After listing the aggressive acts and conspiracies of imperialism, especially US imperialism, against the Asian and African regions, Guo Moruo said that the struggle of the Asian and African people against imperialism and colonialism is still a serious task. However, in some Asian and African countries, some politicians actually believe that the anti-imperialist task has ended and that the spearhead of the struggle can be directed at the people, which is exactly what imperialism wants. Guo Moruo said that we hope that they can recognize the goal of anti-imperialism, continue to stand with the people, and complete the great cause of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. If they insist on abandoning the banner of anti-imperialism, they will surely be spurned by the people. When Guo Moruo exposed the more insidious methods used by US imperialism in attempting to split Asian-African solidarity from within and undermine the Asian-African national independence movement, he also severely condemned modern revisionists for willingly serving as servants of US imperialism and working to realize the conspiracies of US imperialism.

Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, spoke at the meeting one after another, warmly congratulating the victory of the Asian and African people's struggle and congratulating the Bandung Spirit for becoming more and more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

In their speeches, they unanimously pointed out that on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, people cannot but vigilantly see that imperialists and Indian expansionists are using the rebellion of the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet to interfere in our country's internal affairs. They solemnly declared: Tibet is our country's territory, and no one is allowed to interfere in our country's internal affairs. The "Bandung Spirit" will surely continue to be carried forward, and imperialism and all reactionaries will eventually be completely defeated.

Today's meeting was jointly held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation.

Foreign guests from Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, India, Iran, Japan, Thailand, Algeria, Ghana, Guinea, Gambia, Nigeria, Senegal, New Zealand and other countries who are in Beijing were invited to attend the meeting.

Today, the conference expressed its active support for the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students' call for holding "World Youth Anti-Colonialism and Peaceful Coexistence Day" and "National Students' Anti-Colonialism Struggle Solidarity Month."

    首都各界人民在纪念万隆会议大会上警告印度扩张分子
    干涉中国内政的阴谋注定失败
    迎合帝国主义背离万隆精神的人不会有好下场
    新华社23日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若，今天晚间在首都各界人民纪念万隆会议四周年大会上的讲话中说，印度的少数扩张分子，甚至某些印度的政治家，不顾和平共处的五项原则和万隆精神，竟公然支持西藏武装叛乱，干涉中国内政，企图把西藏从中国分裂出去。这是完全继承了英帝国主义的衣钵。这样的阴谋注定是要失败的。
    郭沫若严正警告说，在今天的时代里，谁要迎合帝国主义的意旨，背离和平共处五项原则，背离万隆精神，进行不利于亚非团结的勾当，谁就绝对不会有什么好的下场。
    郭沫若在讲话中说，最近，美帝国主义和他的仆从们——现代修正主义者和某些亚非国家的亲美反动势力，利用西藏问题大肆叫嚣，诬蔑我国平息叛乱是侵略、扩张，是违反五项原则，企图掀起一个反对中国、破坏五项原则的逆流，挑拨我国同印度和东南亚各国的友好关系。郭沫若说，但是帝国主义和外国反动派这种卑鄙手段是蒙蔽不了亚非人民的耳目的。谁都知道，西藏自十三世纪以来就是中国的领土，中国人民在自己的领土上平定叛乱，这纯粹是中国的内政，任何人都不能以任何的形式来进行干涉。
    在万隆会议四周年这个光辉的节日里，首都各界人民三千多人今晚在中山公园音乐堂隆重举行纪念大会，表示六亿五千万中国人民愿与亚非各国人民一道，为维护和发扬万隆精神，为争取亚非人民反殖民主义斗争的进一步胜利，为进一步加强中国人民和亚非各国人民的友好合作关系而共同努力。
    出席大会的有群众团体、民主党派和北京市有关方面的负责人，中国同印度尼西亚、伊拉克、印度、尼泊尔、缅甸、阿联、巴基斯坦友好协会的负责人。他们是李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、陈叔通、李四光、李德全、刘长胜、楚图南、刘格平、达浦生、罗俊、吴晗、胡愈之、周建人、梁思成、陈翰笙、邵宗汉、刘西元、胡启立等。
    大会由中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志主持，他在致词中说，回顾过去四年，亚非人民在“万隆精神”的动员和鼓舞下，向帝国主义和殖民主义发动了强大的冲击，取得了伟大的胜利，使亚非形势发生了巨大的变化。著名的和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议通过的十项原则，不仅在亚非地区已经深入人心，而且在全世界正被越来越多的国家公认为处理国际事务的准则。
    在雷鸣般的掌声中，郭沫若登台发表了长篇讲话。他首先兴奋地说道，四年来，万隆会议播下的种子，已经在亚非广阔的土地上到处开花结果。我们高兴地看到许多已经取得独立的亚非国家，在维护民族独立、坚持和平中立的斗争中，取得了一系列的胜利。
    郭沫若说，伟大的万隆精神早已超出了地区的界限，对全世界特别是拉丁美洲发生了越来越深远的影响。近几年来，拉丁美洲人民在反对美国控制、维护民族独立和争取民主自由的斗争中，取得了一连串的重大胜利，这些胜利不能不对亚非人民的民族解放斗争发生极大的鼓舞和影响。
    郭沫若说，中国是万隆会议的参加国，又是和平共处五项原则的发起国。我国人民同亚非各国人民在反对帝国主义侵略，在维护国家主权、争取民族独立的斗争中的相互支持，进一步考验和发展了我们彼此间的友谊和团结。
    郭沫若强调指出，在欢呼亚非民族独立运动的伟大胜利的时候，我们必须对帝国主义新的侵略阴谋保持高度的警惕。郭沫若列举帝国主义特别是美帝国主义对亚非地区进行的侵略行为和阴谋后说，亚非人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的斗争仍然是一个具有严重性的任务，但是，在某些亚非国家中居然有些政治家认为反帝任务已经结束，可以把斗争的锋芒指向人民，这正中了帝国主义的下怀。郭沫若说，我们希望他们能够认清反帝的目标，继续和人民在一起，来完成反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的大业。如果他们一定要放弃反帝的旗帜，他们就一定会遭受到人民的唾弃。郭沫若在揭露美帝国主义施展更阴险的手法，企图从内部分裂亚非团结、破坏亚非民族独立运动时，还严厉谴责现代修正主义者甘心作美帝国主义的仆从，为实现美帝国主义的阴谋效劳。
    全国总工会副主席刘长胜、全国妇联副主席李德全、全国青联主席刘西元和全国学联主席胡启立先后在会上讲话，热烈祝贺亚非人民斗争的胜利，祝贺万隆精神愈益深入人心。
    他们在讲话中一致指出，在纪念万隆会议四周年的时候，人们不能不警惕地看到，帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子利用西藏上层反动集团的叛乱事件干涉我国的内政。他们庄严地宣称：西藏是我国的领土，不允许任何人干涉我国的内政。“万隆精神”必将继续发扬光大，帝国主义和一切反动派最后必将遭到彻底失败。
    今天的大会，是由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会联合举行的。
    正在北京的朝鲜、蒙古、越南、印度、伊朗、日本、泰国、阿尔及利亚、加纳、几内亚、冈比亚、尼日利亚、塞内加尔、新西兰等国的外宾应邀参加了大会。
    今天，大会对世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会关于举行“世界青年反对殖民主义争取和平共处日”和“各国学生反对殖民主义斗争团结月”，表示积极的支持。
