　　Establish Professional Organizations; Vigorously Propagate Improved Varieties
　　Guangdong and Other Provinces' Communes Comprehensively Arrange for Improved Seed Breeding
　　This newspaper reports that many communes have already established improved seed breeding farms. According to incomplete statistics from Guangdong, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Hunan, Henan, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces (regions), there are already more than five thousand. Many commune management districts or production brigades have established specialized seed teams while the commune establishes improved seed breeding farms.
    Many provinces have comprehensively arranged this year's improved seed breeding work. In Guangdong's Zhanjiang, Shaoguan, Shantou, Foshan, and other special districts, the communes in forty-two counties have established more than one thousand one hundred improved seed breeding farms, and the management districts have established more than three thousand nine hundred specialized seed teams (numbers for Foshan Special District are missing), averaging one to two farms per commune and two to three teams per management district. The improved seed breeding farms of each commune generally have thirty to forty mu of land, in addition to breeding improved varieties, they also rejuvenate seeds that show signs of degradation. The improved seed breeding farms of eight people's communes in Wugang County, Hunan, are making comprehensive arrangements for realizing indica rice transforming to japonica rice and improved seed standardization next year. According to preliminary statistics from Xuchang Special District in Henan, more than one thousand one hundred improved seed breeding farms and more than two thousand two hundred improved seed breeding teams have been established, with more than seventy-three thousand eight hundred management personnel responsible for improved seed breeding. The Xinjiang Agricultural Department has notified all communes to establish improved seed breeding farms and improved seed breeding teams to prepare conditions for realizing the improved seed breeding base network.
    The establishment of improved seed breeding organizations by the people's communes has promoted the breeding of improved crop varieties. Experiences in Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces have proven that breeding improved varieties through these professional organizations facilitates commune leadership and management, better accumulates experience, and cultivates more seed technology cadres. "Building in the spring, growing in the summer, and not managing in the fall" was a common bias in many seed field establishment works in the past. With specialized seed organizations, this bias can be corrected.
    The focus of this year's improved seed breeding work is to breed improved varieties with large ears, many grains, heavy grains, or many bolls, many pods, and large tubers. To accelerate the realization of this task, some provinces and special districts have specifically contracted state-owned farms or communes to carry out improved seed breeding work. Jiangsu Province has reserved five thousand mu in state-owned farms to breed improved varieties of sunflowers such as "Su No. 1," "Su No. 2," and "Hung No. 2." Shanxi Province has contracted 195,000 mu at the provincial level to breed improved varieties, which can produce 120 million jin of improved seeds, and more than 500,000 mu at the special district level, which is expected to produce more than 180 million jin of improved seeds. Shanxi Province has contracted thirty-six excellent varieties of cotton, wheat, corn, sorghum, millet, and tuber, bean, and oil crops.

　　建立专业组织  大力繁殖良种
　　广东等省公社全面安排良种繁殖
    本报讯　许多公社已经建立了良种繁殖场，据广东、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、浙江、江苏、山西、湖南、河南、内蒙古等省（区）不完全统计，已有五千多个。不少公社的管理区或生产大队，在公社建立良种繁殖场的同时成立了种子专业队。
    许多省都全面安排了今年的良种繁殖工作。广东湛江、韶关、汕头、佛山等专区四十二个县的公社，已建良种繁育农场一千一百多个，管理区建立的种子专业队共三千九百多个
  （缺佛山专区数字），平均每社有一至二个场，每个管理区有二至三个队。各公社的良种繁殖场一般有土地三、四十亩，除繁殖良种外，还复壮有退化现象的种子。湖南武冈县八个人民公社的良种繁殖场正为明年实现籼改粳和良种标准化作了全面安排。河南许昌专区据初步统计，已建立良种繁殖场一千一百多个，良种繁殖队二千二百多个，负责良种繁殖的管理人员就有七万三千八百多人。新疆农业厅通知各公社建立良种繁殖场、良种繁殖队，为实现良种繁育基地网准备条件。
    人民公社建立繁殖良种组织，推动了农作物良种繁殖培育工作。黑龙江、江苏等省经验证明，通过这些专业组织繁殖良种，既便于公社领导和管理，也可以更好地积累经验，培养出更多的种子技术干部。“春建、夏长、秋不管”是过去许多建立种子田工作中的偏向。有了种子专业组织，这种偏向就可以纠正了。
    今年良种繁殖工作的中心是繁殖穗大、粒多、粒重或铃多、荚多、块大的良种。为了加速实现这项任务，有些省、专区已经特约国营农场或公社进行良种繁殖工作。江苏省已预约本省各国营农场繁殖
  “苏1号”、“苏2号”、“匈2号”等向日葵良种五千亩。山西省省一级特约繁殖良种的面积十九万五千亩，可产良种一亿二千万斤，专区一级特约繁殖良种的面积五十多万亩，预计可产良种一亿八千多万斤。山西省特约繁殖的有：棉花、小麦、玉米、高粱、谷子和薯类、豆类、油料等作物的优良品种三十六个。
