Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands on April 10, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, extending warm congratulations. The telegram reads as follows:
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands:
    On the occasion of the glorious 40th anniversary of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm fraternal congratulations to you and, through you, to the Communist Party of the Netherlands and the Dutch people.
    Over the past forty years, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, the Communist Party of the Netherlands has gone through a glorious and arduous road, persistently leading the Dutch working class and the Dutch people in their struggle for democracy and social progress. During the Second World War, it united the Dutch people and carried out a heroic struggle against the fascist bandits. In the post-war period, it made outstanding efforts to oppose the aggression and war policies of the war bloc headed by US imperialism, to safeguard national sovereignty, and to defend world peace. The Communist Party of the Netherlands has demonstrated a great spirit of internationalism in consistently supporting Indonesia's struggle against colonialism and for national independence.
    The Communist Party of the Netherlands has firmly defended the principles of the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, resolutely opposed Yugoslav modern revisionism, and at the same time, within the Dutch Party, has victoriously carried out the struggle against the revisionist group, defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism, consolidated the unity of the Party, and strengthened the Party's combat effectiveness.
    The current international situation is increasingly favorable for the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace, strive for democracy and social progress. We sincerely congratulate the fraternal Communist Party of the Netherlands, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Paul de Groot, on achieving greater success in the struggle against the aggression and war policies of US imperialism, to defend world peace, and to strive for democracy and social progress for the Dutch people.
          The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, April 6, 1959

    中共中央致电荷共中央
    祝贺荷兰共产党成立四十周年
    新华社9日讯　4月10日是荷兰共产党成立四十周年纪念日，中国共产党中央委员会打电报给荷兰共产党中央委员会，致以热烈的祝贺。电文如下：荷兰共产党中央委员会：
    值此光荣的荷兰共产党四十周年的时候，中国共产党中央谨向你们、并通过你们向荷兰共产党和荷兰人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    四十年来，荷兰共产党在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，经历了光荣的和艰苦的道路，坚持不懈地领导着荷兰工人阶级和荷兰人民进行了争取民主和社会进步的斗争。在第二次世界大战时期，团结荷兰人民，同法西斯匪帮进行了英勇的斗争。在战后时期，为反对以美帝国主义为首的战争集团的侵略和战争政策，为维护国家主权，为保卫世界和平作了卓越的努力。荷兰共产党在一贯地支持印度尼西亚反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争中，表现了伟大的国际主义精神。
    荷兰共产党坚定地维护了社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言的原则，坚决地反对了南斯拉夫现代修正主义；同时在荷兰党内，胜利地进行了反对修正主义集团的斗争，保卫了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，巩固了党的团结，加强了党的战斗力。
    现在的国际形势，对于全世界人民保卫和平、争取民主和社会进步的斗争是日益有利的。我们衷心地祝贺兄弟的荷兰共产党，在以保尔·特·格鲁特同志为首的中央委员会领导下，在为反对美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策、保卫世界和平、争取荷兰人民民主和社会进步的斗争中取得更大的成就。
          中国共产党中央委员会　1959年4月6日
