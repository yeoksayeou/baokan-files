Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Taipei: Taiwan National Assembly member Ma Xiaojun was killed by a U.S. military vehicle more than a month ago. The murderer, U.S. Army Sergeant Droumzs, under the protection of the U.S. military command in Taiwan, still runs free and has not been punished in any way.

According to Hong Kong newspaper reports, the United States and pro-American "officials" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique have also been persecuting Fang Fusheng, Ma Xiaojun's wife, threatening this old woman, who is lying in the hospital after being seriously injured, to sign a letter to the U.S. "Ambassador" to Taiwan, Drumright, which was written in advance by pro-American "officials" of the Kuomintang. The content of this letter is not to demand punishment of the murderer, but to ask the U.S. authorities to "handle the case leniently." The U.S. "Ambassador" to Taiwan, Drumright, immediately replied, saying that he "would take the request for leniency into consideration." After these two letters were published in the Taiwan Kuomintang "Central Daily News" on March 12, they aroused indignation among the people of Taiwan and many Kuomintang military and government personnel. People believe that this is the United States and pro-American "officials" in the Chiang Kai-shek clique trying to exonerate the U.S. military murderer, and insulting and persecuting Fang Fusheng, who was harmed by the American soldier, losing her husband and being injured herself.

According to Taiwan newspaper reports, because the U.S. military enjoys so-called "diplomatic immunity" in Taiwan, about two thousand U.S. military officers and soldiers who drove vehicles and killed or injured Taiwanese compatriots last year have not been punished in any way.

    蒋集团亲美官员为凶犯开脱
    杀害马晓军美兵仍逍遥法外
    台湾人民表示愤慨
    新华社2日讯台北消息：台湾国民党立法委员马晓军被美国军车撞死已有一个多月。杀人凶犯美军上士德鲁姆兹在侵台美军司令部的包庇下，至今仍然逍遥法外，没有受到任何的惩处。
    据香港报纸消息，美国和蒋介石集团亲美“官员”还向马晓军之妻方福生横施迫害，威胁这个受重伤后躺在医院的老妇人，在一封由国民党亲美“官员”事先写好的给美国驻台湾“大使”德鲁姆赖特的信上签名。这封信的内容不是要求惩凶，而是要美国当局对凶手“作宽恕之处理”。美国驻台湾“大使”德鲁姆赖特也马上复信，表示“承嘱从宽处理一点，更使吾人同感”。在3月12日的台湾国民党“中央日报”刊出这两封信后，引起了台湾人民和许多国民党军政人员的愤慨。人们都认为这是美国和蒋介石集团中的亲美“官员”为了要替美军杀人犯开脱罪责，而对被美国兵害得夫死己伤的方福生进行侮辱和迫害。
    另据台湾报纸消息，因美军在台湾享有所谓“外交豁免权”，去年驾车撞死撞伤台湾同胞的美军官兵约有二千名，都没有受到任何惩处。
