Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: A nationwide mobilization to launch a broad and deep increase production and practice economy campaign, guaranteeing the comprehensive completion of the 1959 national economic plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton – this was the focus of the discussion at the Second National People's Congress, First Session, at the afternoon meeting today.

The representatives pointed out in their speeches at today's meeting that China's Great Leap Forward in 1958 was unprecedented. Following the path opened up in 1958, the Chinese people will muster even greater effort, work hard, work practically, and work cleverly, determined to achieve even more brilliant achievements on all fronts this year.

Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Seventh Office Deng Zihui, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court Gao Kelin, Minister of Metallurgical Industry Wang Heshou, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Minister of Commerce Cheng Zihua, Minister of Light Industry Li Zhuchen, Minister of Coal Industry Zhang Linzhi, Vice Minister of Railways Lu Zhengcao, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission He Xiangning and Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Ningyi and other government leaders all spoke at today's afternoon meeting, expressing their opinions on various aspects of the work.

Representative Wang Heshou said in his speech that this year's plan to produce 18 million tons of steel is a huge leap forward target. After this target is achieved, the face of China's steel industry will undergo a major change. The many small steel plants established last year in the vast majority of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions will form relatively complete steel enterprises; the number of large steel enterprises will increase, and new steel bases will appear in areas that previously had no steel industry.

When talking about how to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's huge leap forward task in the steel industry, Wang Heshou said: Continuing to resolutely implement the policy of vigorously launching mass movements in industrial production and construction, and giving full play to the production potential of existing enterprises, is an important guarantee for completing this year's steel industry production targets.

Representative Zhang Linzhi spoke on the coal production situation in China. He said that in order to victoriously complete and over-fulfill the 1959 production and construction tasks of the coal industry, a vigorous and magnificent large-scale high-yield, high-quality red flag competition movement has been universally launched in coal mining enterprises across the country. Coal mines in various regions are continuing to deeply carry out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements, to increase the output of all coal mining working faces, and achieve the goal of large-scale high yield. Zhang Linzhi said that coal mine workers across the country will certainly be able to complete and over-fulfill the production task of 380 million tons, and will certainly be able to realize the Great Leap Forward in the coal industry in 1959.

Representative Deng Zihui said that the 1959 grain, cotton, and agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production increase targets must be strived for and over-fulfilled. This is a glorious and arduous task on the agricultural front, and we must make the greatest efforts to continue to leap forward and strive for a greater harvest in 1959.

In his speech, Deng Zihui expressed his opinions on comprehensively and appropriately implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture according to local conditions, carrying out a large-scale high-yield movement; resolutely overcoming natural disasters; implementing diversified operations; and continuing to do a good job in the rectification and construction of people's communes. He pointed out that after several months of rectification and construction, people's communes in various regions will certainly further demonstrate their superiority in the agricultural Great Leap Forward, which is a reliable guarantee for realizing a greater agricultural harvest this year. Deng Zihui also gave a brief explanation of the Yellow River management situation over the past few years in his speech today.

Representative Lu Zhengcao said in his speech that this year, with the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the railway transportation industry will also have great development. He said that to complete this year's huge transportation task, the railway department must take coal transportation as the key link, make overall arrangements, and rationally use transportation capacity.

Lu Zhengcao required all railway workers to accelerate railway infrastructure construction and at the same time, vigorously strengthen transportation organization work, and fully tap the potential of existing equipment. He said that this is an effective method that does not cost money or costs little money, and can rapidly increase transportation capacity.

After introducing the specific situation of the further accelerated development of light industry this year, Li Zhuchen said that on the basis of the continued leap forward of China's national economy and the increase in people's purchasing power in 1959, light industry must and can have another Great Leap Forward. He said that under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, vigorously launching mass movements, carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in existing enterprises, and running industries in people's communes are the basic methods for realizing the leap forward in light industry.

Representative Liu Ningyi called on workers across the country to launch an increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, and to comprehensively complete the various indicators of the 1959 national plan in terms of output, quality, variety, cost reduction, and reduction of various consumption quotas.

Liu Ningyi said that constantly resolving the contradiction between the advanced and the backward is the most important method for improving the production level of the entire society. The most effective method to transform the level of a few advanced producers into the universal production level of the vast number of workers is competition and appraisal. He pointed out that only through competition and appraisal, establishing pace-setters, and raising the banner of the advanced can the enthusiasm of the masses to strive for progress be stimulated, the backward be encouraged to catch up quickly, and the advanced producers be promoted to work harder.

Minister Cheng Zihua pointed out in his speech that the commercial work in 1959 should, on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, earnestly do a good job in the purchase, sale, transfer, and storage of commodities, vigorously support the continued Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, arrange the market well, and strive to realize the 1959 national economic plan. Cheng Zihua said that in order to ensure the completion of this year's commercial work tasks, commercial departments at all levels should, under the leadership of the central and local Party committees and governments, continue to extensively, deeply, and practically carry out a "six-good" red flag movement with the content of promoting good production, good policy implementation, good plan completion, good business management, good service quality, and good advance towards becoming both red and expert.

Representative Shen Yanbing's speech depicted the flourishing scene of cultural and artistic work that has emerged with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. He said that mass amateur cultural activities were unprecedentedly active in 1958; literary and artistic creation blossomed like a hundred flowers; tens of thousands of active amateur literary and artistic activists emerged from the worker, peasant, and soldier masses, greatly strengthening the ranks of China's cultural and artistic undertakings.

Shen Yanbing hoped that cultural and artistic workers across the country would continue to muster their efforts in 1959, further strengthen their integration with the worker and peasant masses, do a good job in cultural popularization work and improvement on the basis of popularization, conscientiously implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, and under the leadership of the Party and the government, push literary and artistic creation and the entire cultural work to a more prosperous stage, and be worthy of our great era.

Representative Zhang Dingcheng reported on the procuratorial work of the past four years in his speech. He said that with the brilliant achievements of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, the struggle on the socialist legal front has also achieved great victories.

Zhang Dingcheng said that our country has entered a new historical period of people's communalization, our country is more consolidated, the level of consciousness and organization of the people has been further improved, and counter-revolutionaries are fewer and weaker, so the scope of dictatorship is gradually shrinking, and the democratic life of the people is further expanding. However, the dictatorship function of the socialist legal system against the enemy cannot be relaxed, and state laws must be used to sanction all counter-revolutionary elements and other criminals who engage in sabotage, and rely on the broad masses of the people to further strengthen the transformation of past landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, to maintain the socialist legal system and defend socialist construction.

Representative Gao Kelin said in his speech that since 1955, the number of cases accepted by people's courts at all levels across the country has generally shown a downward trend. In 1958, due to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially after the realization of the people's commune in the national rural areas, the downward trend in the number of cases accepted became even more significant. This is a reflection of the great victory of our socialist revolution and construction. It shows that our country has become more consolidated, and social order has become more stable.

After reporting on the work of the Supreme People's Court over the past four years at the meeting, Gao Kelin pointed out that in 1959, it is necessary to continue to implement the mass line and the policy of combining judicial work with productive labor, and to guarantee the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959 from the perspective of judicial work.

The joint speech of Li Shunda, the first director, and Shen Jilan, the second director, of the Xigou People's Commune in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, vividly illustrated that their poor mountain village that "lacked all five elements" has now become "possessing all five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth." A large iron mine has been opened there, and carts of ore have been pulled to the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant; bald mountains have grown "hair," and the plan of ten thousand mu of forests and one thousand mu of gardens has been realized; the Baili Beach has been fought against, and more than one hundred large and small reservoirs have been built; there is coal and electricity; and soil erosion has been basically controlled. Before liberation, the grain yield per mu there was 180 jin, and last year's Great Leap Forward saw the yield per mu suddenly increase to 803 jin. They said that we will never relax our efforts and be complacent, and we will continue to leap forward every year, turning small "possession" into large "possession," all the way to communism.

Representative He Xiangning introduced the achievements of overseas Chinese work and domestic overseas Chinese affairs work. She said that in recent years, the Party and the government have led returned overseas Chinese, their relatives, and the people of the whole country to carry out the socialist revolution, led them to actively participate in socialist construction, and at the same time, based on their characteristics and proceeding from the interests of 600 million people, made overall plans, took into account all aspects, made appropriate arrangements for them, and gave them appropriate care. The vast number of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives have made great contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland. In the Great Leap Forward since last year, they warmly supported the people's commune, 100% of the overseas Chinese households in rural areas joined the people's commune, and actively participated in the construction work of the people's commune.

He Xiangning said that the motherland is very concerned about overseas Chinese and does its best to protect the legitimate interests of overseas Chinese. We earnestly hope that overseas Chinese can better unite and cooperate, and consolidate and develop the close friendship with the local people.

The speech of Chen Jiageng, chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, sternly condemned the Indian expansionist elements for supporting the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in China's internal affairs. He said that Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory, and the Chinese people will not agree to anyone who wants to destroy it, and the overseas Chinese will never agree. Chen Jiageng said that the conspiracy of the British imperialists to create so-called "Tibetan independence" has long gone bankrupt, and now some people want to accept this shameful conspiracy as a precious heritage, which cannot but be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, and the result will inevitably be a complete failure.

Chen Jiageng pointed out that imperialism should be the common enemy of the Chinese and Indian people, and the Chinese people will absolutely not do things that the Indian people do not want to do. Similarly, the Indian people should not allow ambitious politicians to do things that the Chinese people do not want to do. If some ambitious people dare to provoke the Chinese people, they will be moths flying into a flame.

All the representatives who spoke at the meeting continued to sternly condemn the imperialists and Indian expansionists for supporting the Tibetan rebellion and their attempt to split China.

All members of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC attended the meeting as observers.

The executive chairmen of today's afternoon meeting were: Lin Boqu, Zeng Xisheng, Shen Yanbing, Li Dequan, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Liu Geping, Zhu Kezhen, Shao Lizi, Li Shunda, Hu Juewen.

Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: The Second National People's Congress, First Session, continued to hold a plenary session this morning.

The representatives used a large number of facts to illustrate that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. Liu Wenhui, director of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, said after talking about the new face he saw in the rural areas of Sichuan Province during his recent inspection that the unprecedented leap forward in agricultural production, the establishment, development, and consolidation of the people's commune since 1958 are all victories of the Party's leadership and the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction. Liu Jianxi, chief engineer of the Guiyang Railway Bureau, introduced the rapid development of railway construction in Guizhou Province in his speech. He said, why has railway construction in Guizhou Province progressed so rapidly? The answer from the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province is: It is not that we are magical, but that the power of the Party is boundless.

In their speeches, the representatives also praised the soaring enthusiasm and rich wisdom of the people from all aspects. Zhou Jianren, governor of Zhejiang Province, said that all special districts and counties in Zhejiang Province held "on-site comparison of skills" meetings during rice transplanting to exchange technical experience, which had good results.

In their speeches, many representatives also recounted the thriving scene of scientific research work based on their own experiences. Zhang Hanying, Vice Minister of Water Resources and Electricity, introduced the rapid development of water conservancy science and technology work.

Dapu Sheng, vice chairman of the China Islamic Association, and many other members sternly condemned the treasonous crimes of the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet at the meeting. The members expressed great indignation at the fact that the imperialists and Indian expansionists actually used the Tibetan rebellion to interfere in China's internal affairs.

A total of 39 members spoke at the two venues of the CPPCC this morning. They reflected the prosperous scene of China's Great Leap Forward from all aspects, talked about the situation and experience of members of democratic parties, industrialists and businessmen, and old intellectuals in carrying out self-transformation while serving socialism, and put forward suggestions and opinions on various tasks. Lu Xinyuan, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, said in his speech that the increasing strength of the motherland has given overseas Chinese great encouragement. In the past four years, a total of 115,800 overseas Chinese have returned to China. They have received the kind concern, education, and thoughtful care of the Party and the People's Government.

The speeches of many members showed that China's education cause had a leap forward in the past year and experienced a huge and profound revolution. Yang Yizhou, deputy governor of Hebei Province, said that the ideal of popularizing education for many years has been initially realized in Hebei Province. At present, a wave of national learning has formed throughout the province. Sangre Gyatso, director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Education, especially mentioned that due to the in-depth development of the socialist revolution in the pastoral areas of Qinghai, the establishment of people's communes on the grasslands, the herdsmen urgently demanded to learn culture and technology, and the education cause also showed a vigorous development.

  　全民动员开展增产节约运动
    人大代表和政协委员强调保证完成今年经济计划
    继续严斥帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政
    新华社24日讯　动员全国人民广泛深入地开展增产节约运动，保证全面地完成以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的1959年国民经济计划，这是第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议今天下午大会讨论的中心。
    代表们在今天的大会发言中指出，我国1958年的大跃进是史无前例的。沿着1958年开辟出来的道路，我国人民将鼓足更大干劲，苦干实干巧干，决心在今年的各个战线上取得更辉煌的成就。
    国务院副总理兼第七办公室主任邓子恢、最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞、最高人民法院副院长高克林、冶金工业部长王鹤寿、文化部长沈雁冰、商业部长程子华、轻工业部长李烛尘、煤炭工业部长张霖之、铁道部副部长吕正操、华侨事务委员会主任何香凝等政府负责人和中华全国总工会主席刘宁一，都在今天下午的大会上发言，就各方面的工作发表了意见。
    王鹤寿代表在发言中说，今年我国生产一千八百万吨钢的计划是一个巨大的跃进指标。这个指标完成以后，我国钢铁工业的面貌就会有重大的改观。全国绝大多数省、市、自治区去年建立起来的许多小型钢铁厂将形成比较完整的钢铁企业；大型钢铁企业的数目增加，过去没有钢铁工业的地区，将出现新的钢铁基地。
    在谈到如何保证完成和超额完成今年钢铁工业的巨大跃进任务时，王鹤寿说：在工业生产建设中继续坚决贯彻大搞群众运动的方针，发挥现有企业的生产潜力，是完成今年钢铁工业生产指标的重要保证。
    张霖之代表就我国煤炭生产情况发言。他说，为了胜利地完成和超额完成1959年煤炭工业的生产建设任务，一个声势浩大、规模壮阔，以高产、高质为中心的大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动，已在全国煤矿企业中普遍展开。各地煤矿正在继续深入开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，以提高全部采煤工作面的产量，达到大面积丰产的目的。张霖之说，全国煤矿职工今年一定能够完成和超额完成三亿八千万吨的生产任务，一定能够实现煤炭工业1959年的大跃进。
    邓子恢代表说，1959年的粮食、棉花以及农、林、牧业各项增产指标，必须力争完成和超额完成。这是农业战线上光荣而艰巨的任务，我们必须尽最大的努力，继续跃进，争取1959年更大的丰收。
    邓子恢在发言中，就全面地因地制宜地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”、开展大面积丰产运动；坚决战胜自然灾害；实行多种经营；继续做好人民公社的整顿和建设工作等问题发表了意见。他指出：各地人民公社经过了几个月的整顿建设以后，一定在农业大跃进中进一步发挥它的优越性，这是实现今年农业更大丰收的可靠保证。邓子恢今天在发言中还对几年来的黄河治理情况又作了简要说明。
    吕正操代表在发言中说，今年，随着工农业生产的增长，铁路运输事业也将有很大的发展。他说，完成今年巨大的运输任务，铁路部门必须以煤运为纲，全面安排，合理使用运输力。
    吕正操要求全路职工在加速铁路基本建设的同时，必须大力加强运输组织工作，充分挖掘现有设备的潜力。他说，这是不花钱或者少花钱，而能迅速增长运输能力的有效办法。　　　　
    李烛尘在介绍了今年轻工业进一步加速发展的具体情况以后说，在1959年我国国民经济继续跃进和人民购买力提高的基础上，轻工业必须而且可能再来一个大跃进。他说，在各级党和政府领导下大搞群众运动，在现有企业中开展技术革新和技术革命与在人民公社中举办工业，这是实现轻工业跃进的基本方法。
    刘宁一代表号召全国职工开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，保证在产量、质量、品种上，在降低成本方面和降低各种消耗定额方面，全面地完成1959年国家计划的各项指标。
    刘宁一说，不断地解决先进同落后的矛盾，是提高整个社会生产水平的一个最重要的方法。把少数先进生产者的水平变为广大职工普遍的生产水平，最有效的方法就是竞赛评比。他指出，只有通过竞赛评比，树立起标兵，把先进的旗帜高高地举起，才可以激发群众力争上游的热情，鼓舞落后者急起直追，促进先进生产者更加努力。
    程子华部长在发言中指出，1959年的商业工作应该在去年大跃进的基础上，认真作好商品的购、销、调、存工作，大力支持工农业生产的继续大跃进，安排好市场，为实现1959年国民经济计划而努力。程子华说，为了保证完成今年的商业工作任务，各级商业部门应该在中央和各级党委、政府的领导下，继续广泛地深入踏实地开展一个以促进生产好、执行政策好、完成计划好、经营管理好、服务质量好和向红专进军好为内容的“六好”红旗运动。
    沈雁冰代表的发言，描绘了随着工农业生产大跃进而出现的文化艺术工作的繁荣景象。他说，1958年群众业余文化活动空前活跃；文学艺术创作有如百花盛开；成千上万业余的文学艺术活动积极分子从工农兵群众中涌现出来，大大壮大了我国文化艺术事业的队伍。
    沈雁冰希望全国文化艺术工作者在1959年继续鼓足干劲，进一步密切同工农群众的结合，做好文化普及工作和在普及基础上的提高工作，认真贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，在党和政府的领导下，把文学艺术创作和整个文化工作推向更加繁荣昌盛的阶段，而无愧于我们这个伟大的时代。
    张鼎丞代表在发言中报告了四年来的检察工作。他说，随着我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得辉煌成就，我国社会主义法制战线上的斗争，也取得了巨大的胜利。
    张鼎丞说，我们的国家已经进入了一个人民公社化的新的历史时期，我们的国家更加巩固了，人民群众的觉悟程度和组织程度更加提高了，反革命更少、更弱了，因而专政的范围在逐步缩小，人民民主生活在进一步扩大。但是，社会主义法制对敌人的专政作用，仍然不能放松，必须用国家的法律去制裁一切进行破坏的反革命分子和其他犯罪分子，并依靠广大人民群众，进一步加强对过去的地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的改造工作，以维护社会主义法制，保卫社会主义建设。
    高克林代表在发言中说，从1955年以来，全国各级人民法院受理的案件数量总的看来是下降的趋势。在1958年，由于工农业生产的大跃进，特别全国农村中实现了人　民公社化以后，收案数量下降的趋势更加显著。这是我国社会主义革命和建设取得伟大胜利的一种反映。它说明了我们的国家已经更加巩固，社会秩序更加安定。
    高克林在会上报告了最高人民法院四年来的工作以后指出，在1959年，要继续贯彻群众路线和司法工作与生产劳动相结合的方针，从司法工作方面，来保障1959年工农业生产的大跃进。
    山西平顺县西沟人民公社第一主任李顺达代表和第二主任申纪兰代表的联合发言，生动地说明他们那“五行俱缺”的穷山沟，现在变成“金木水火土五行俱有”了。那里已经开采大铁矿，一车车矿石拉到了长治钢铁厂；一座座秃山长起“头发”，实现了万亩林千亩园的计划；大战百里滩，修起了一百多个大小水库；有了煤，也有了电；基本控制住了水土流失。解放前，那里粮食亩产一百八十斤，去年大跃进，亩产量突增到八百零三斤。他们说，我们决不松劲自满，还要年年大跃进，把小“有”变成大“有”，一直到有了共产主义。
    何香凝代表介绍了华侨工作和国内侨务工作的成绩。她说，几年来党和政府领导归侨、侨眷和全国人民一道进行社会主义革命，领导他们积极参加社会主义建设，同时也根据他们的特点和从六亿人民的利益出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排，对他们作了适当照顾。广大归侨、侨眷在祖国社会主义建设事业中作出了很大贡献。在去年以来的大跃进中，他们热烈拥护人民公社，农村中百分之百的侨户加入了人民公社，积极参加了人民公社的建设工作。
    何香凝说，祖国对国外华侨寄予很大的关怀，并且尽力保护华侨的正当利益。我们热切希望华侨能更好地团结合作，并巩固与发展和当地人民的亲切友谊。
    全国侨联主席陈嘉庚代表的发言，严正地谴责了印度扩张主义分子支持西藏叛乱和干涉中国内政的行为。他说，西藏是中国不可分割的领土，任何人想把它加以破坏，中国人民不会答应，华侨也决不会答应。陈嘉庚说，英帝国主义者制造所谓“西藏独立”的阴谋早已破产了，现在竟有人要把这个可耻的阴谋当为宝贵的遗产来接受，这不能不遭到中国人民包括西藏人民的坚决反对，其结果也必然遭到彻底的失败。
    陈嘉庚指出，帝国主义应该是中国人民和印度人民的共同敌人，中国人民绝对不会做出印度人民所不愿意的事情，同样的，印度人民也不应该放任怀有野心的政治家作出中国人民所不愿意的事情，如果某些野心家敢于向中国人民进行挑衅，将是飞蛾扑火。
    所有在大会上发言的代表，都继续严厉地斥责了帝国主义和印度扩张主义者支持西藏叛乱和妄图分裂中国的阴谋。
    政协第三届全国委员会全体委员列席参加会议。

    据新华社24日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，今天上午继续进行大会发言。
    代表们用大量事实说明，党的领导是社会主义建设事业大跃进的根本保证。民革四川省委员会主任委员刘文辉代表在谈到他最近视察四川省农村时看到的新面貌后　说，1958年以来农业生产的空前跃进，人民公社的建立、发展和巩固，都是党的领导的胜利，党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利。贵阳铁路局总工程师刘建熙代表在发言中介绍了贵州省铁路建设迅速发展的情形。他说，为什么贵州省的铁路建设进展这样迅速，贵州省各族人民的回答是：不是我们神通广，而是党的力量大无边。
    代表们在发言中，还从各方面赞扬了人民群众的冲天干劲和丰富智慧。浙江省省长周建人代表说，浙江全省各专区、县在插秧中都召开了“现场比巧”大会，交流技术经验，效果很好。
