    The Total Age of Animals
    Modern humans have existed on Earth for a total of only about one hundred thousand years.

    Modern dogs, pigs, and tapirs have existed for about twenty million years from their ancestors to the present, while cats, horses, sheep, and camels have existed for seven to eight million years from their ancestors to the present.

    The oldest animals—octopuses, squids, sponges, starfish, and the ancestors of mollusks—appeared on Earth more than 500 million years ago, while the most "youthful" reindeer have only been around for a total of 350,000 years.

    Eagles are one of the oldest birds, their ancestors having existed 55 million years ago; ducks, pelicans, shrikes, and wagtails have existed for 25 million years, while storks and nuthatches have only existed for a few million years in total.

    动物的总年龄
    现代人类在地球上生存了总共不过十万年左右。
    现代狗、猪、獏从它们的祖先到现在生存了两千万年左右，而猫、马、羊、骆驼从他们的祖先到现在生存了七、八百万年。
    最古老的动物——章鱼、乌贼、海绵、海星和软体动物的祖先在地球上出现在五亿多年前，而最“年轻”的北方鹿总共只有三十五万年。
    雕是最古老的鸟类之一，它的祖先在五千五百万年前就已经生存了；鸭、鹈鹕、伯劳、鹡鸰生存了两千五百万年，而鹳、鳾总共还只生存几百万年。
