By our correspondent Sun Ruogang from Harbin on the 20th: Under the guidance of the "nation as a single chessboard" ideology, large, medium, and small mechanical factories in Heilongjiang Province are actively undertaking the glorious task of producing complete sets of heavy machinery and equipment through comprehensive collaboration.

During the First Five-Year Plan, Heilongjiang initiated departmental collaboration in key construction projects and achieved some success. In recent years, departmental collaboration has evolved into regional collaboration, and industrial collaboration has expanded into comprehensive collaboration between industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, and industry and commerce. This has formed a collaborative network within and outside the province, connecting departments and regions, vertically and horizontally, embodying the "nation as a single chessboard" ideology. This year, complete sets of large power generation equipment and heavy metallurgical equipment will be supplied to support the entire country. This is a new task in organizing production collaboration. This year, the production task of Harbin power station equipment has increased nearly tenfold compared to last year. The supporting equipment for the three main engines of the power station (boilers, turbines, and generators) totals more than 8,300 pieces, and the supporting equipment for auxiliary machines far exceeds that of the main engines. It requires organizing more than 100 factories to collaborate in order to complete the complete set task.

In order to effectively organize large-scale production collaboration, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a collaboration conference to seriously discuss collaboration ideology, equipment materials, and task arrangements. The conference was attended by industrial ministers from prefectural and municipal party committees throughout the province and leading cadres from many factories. They used the method of "stating facts, reasoning, and comparing weights" to conduct repeated research. At the same time, many big-character posters were put up. The meeting believed that the key to doing a good job in collaboration is to put politics in command and promote the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration.

The conference not only solved the "nation as a single chessboard" ideology in collaboration ideologically, but also guaranteed the implementation of the "nation as a single chessboard" policy in the arrangement of equipment, materials, and tasks. It rationally adjusted the collaboration tasks and adopted some new collaboration measures to ensure that every item of supporting products is arranged and every piece has a destination. In the utilization of equipment, the method of large and small exchanges is adopted, so that the large equipment of large factories and the medium and small equipment of medium and small factories can fully play the role of collaboration and supporting. For example, some large factories in Qiqihar originally produced non-standard equipment for their own expansion. After this adjustment, it was determined that these large factories should undertake the task of manufacturing large castings and forgings, and the original tasks were assigned to small and medium-sized factories. This solved the important key to manufacturing a large number of rolling mills this year. The conference also adopted the method of "everyone taking on the burden of one family's difficulties" to ensure the completion of Harbin's batch of coal washing equipment supporting tasks. Important parts such as diesel engine crankshafts, injection pumps, and air pressure gauges cannot be produced by every factory. After overall consideration, it was decided that these several precision parts should all be made in four large factories. For example, Jiamusi area is undertaking the manufacturing task of 140 mining hoists this year, but at present they only have a half-ton steam hammer, and the forging capacity is very low, which makes it very difficult to complete this task. If relying solely on external collaboration, it will not only cause waste in round-trip transportation, but also make it difficult to complete the task on time. The conference decided that the Qiqihar factory should produce a three-ton steam hammer for them, so that the Jiamusi area can process some larger forgings themselves in the future, so as to complete the production task of mining equipment on time.

### 摆事实比轻重一家困难大家承担  黑龙江组织配套大协作

    摆事实比轻重一家困难大家承担
    黑龙江组织配套大协作
    本报哈尔滨20日电　记者孙若刚报道：在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，黑龙江省的大型和中、小型机械工厂正以全面协作的积极行动担负着重型机械设备配套生产的光荣任务。
    第一个五年计划期间黑龙江在重点工程建设中曾经发起部门协作，收到一定的成效。几年来，由部门协作发展到地区协作，由工业之间的协作发展到工业和农业、城市和乡村、工业和商业之间的全面协作。形成了省内和省外部门和地区、条条和块块纵横交错体现“全国一盘棋”思想的协作网。今年，支援全国的大型发电设备和重型冶金设备都要配套供应。这在组织生产协作工作中，是一项更新的任务。今年，哈尔滨电站设备生产任务比去年增长将近十倍，电站三大主机（锅炉、汽轮机、发电机）的配套设备，共有八千三百多件，辅机的配套设备更是远远超过了它的主机。需要组织一百多个工厂进行协作，才能完成配套任务。
    为了有效地组织生产大协作，中共黑龙江省委在最近一次协作会议上对协作思想、设备材料、任务安排等方面又认真地进行一次讨论。参加这次会议讨论的有全省的地、市委工业部长和许多工厂的领导干部。他们用“摆事实、讲道理、比轻重”的方法，进行了反复的研究。同时还贴出了许多张大字报。会议认为搞好协作的关键首先是政治挂帅，发扬共产主义大协作的精神。
    会议不仅从思想上解决了协作中的“全国一盘棋”的思想，而且在设备材料任务的安排上，保证了“全国一盘棋”方针的贯彻。合理地调整了协作任务和采取一些新的协作措施，保证配套产品项项有安排，件件有着落。在设备的利用上，采取大小对调的办法，使大厂的大设备和中小型工厂的中小型设备都能充分发挥协作配套的作用。像齐齐哈尔一些大工厂原来自己生产扩建用的非标准设备，经过这次调整确定这些大工厂要担负起制造大型铸件和锻件的任务，原有的任务让给中小工厂去做，这样，解决了今年制造大批轧钢机的重要关键。这次会议还采取“一家困难大家承担”的办法，保证哈尔滨大批洗煤设备配套任务的完成。像柴油机的曲轴、射油泵、汽压计等重要部件却不是每个工厂都能生产的，经过全盘考虑，决定这几种精密的部件全部放在四个大工厂里去做。又如佳木斯地区，今年他们担负着一百四十台矿山卷扬机的制造任务，但是目前他们只有半吨的汽锤，锻压能力很低，对完成这项任务有很大困难。如果单靠外地协作，不仅造成往返运输上的浪费，而且很难按时完成任务。会议决定由齐齐哈尔的工厂给他们生产一台三吨的汽锤，让佳木斯这个地区今后能够自己加工一部分较大的锻件，以便按时完成矿山设备生产任务。
