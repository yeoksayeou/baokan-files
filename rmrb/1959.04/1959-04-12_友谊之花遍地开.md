Flowers of Friendship Bloom Everywhere
　　Xie Shiyan, Ma Yuping

　　In March, we visited the Zhangyi People's Commune in Guyuan County, north of the Liupan Mountains, jointly formed by the Hui and Han people.
　　When we arrived at the commune, we saw poems praising the Great Leap Forward, written by Hui and Han commune members, posted everywhere on walls and streets. One poem read:
　　The wisdom of the masses is the source,
　　With a hoe, ten thousand poems come forth;
　　United production leaps forward greatly,
　　Hui and Han people rejoice with smiling faces.
　　In the early spring weather, the Liupan Mountains were still covered with silvery snow, but the valleys and riverbanks below were filled with beautiful scenes of Hui and Han commune members vigorously engaging in spring plowing. In the morning, as the sun just rose from the light mist on the mountain ridges, Hui and Han commune members from each village drove their oxen, carried their seeders, and rushed to the fields. In an instant, every mountain gully was caught up in the intense spring sowing.
　　Along a small river, we visited the Huangbao Production Brigade of this commune. This was a production team composed of two hundred and thirty-seven Hui households and fifty-seven Han households. As early as 1955, during the period of elementary cooperatives, Hui and Han farmers had formed agricultural cooperatives, one of which was named "Unity Cooperative." It was newly established, small and weak, with few livestock, but the Hui and Han members united as one to overcome various difficulties. In the first year of its establishment, the crops yielded a great harvest. From the agricultural collectivization to the establishment of the commune, the Hui and Han members of the entire team diverted water from the Liupan Mountain valleys to irrigate the drought-stricken fields for many years, building a total of seven channels, which could irrigate nearly four thousand mu of land, turning all the basic farmland into irrigated land. We saw the melting snow water from the Liupan Mountains flowing along the newly opened channels into the soft fields.
　　This year, the team's cultivation is even more meticulous. All of the team's six hundred plus mu of high-yield fields are being cultivated using the method of intercropping, deep plowing more than one chi deep, and implementing "three plows, three harrowings, and three rollings," as well as building small ridges. The members divided the basic farmland and large areas of high-yield fields into three grades, applying fertilizer at a rate of between twenty thousand jin and thirty thousand jin per mu. Some high-yield fields not only had base fertilizer applied but also had a layer of fertilizer applied along the plow furrow during sowing. The technical committees and advisory groups composed of Hui and Han veteran farmers, and the selected experts in sowing and operating seeders, conducted a comprehensive technical discussion on spring sowing before sowing, formulating sowing measures and technical standards. When the members talked about this year's intensive farming, everyone smiled and said: "This year, we are all like embroiderers and weavers, decorating every field with gold and embroidery."
　　Throughout this commune, one can see moving scenes of Hui and Han members uniting in production. When we arrived at the Luotuo Ji team, dozens of miles away from the Huangbao team, the youth shock brigade organized by Hui and Han members was vigorously transporting fertilizer to the high-yield fields. Team leader Guo Hongru told us many moving stories about the unity of the Hui and Han members of this team. Before communization, this team was a senior cooperative formed by merging six elementary cooperatives from Hui and Han villages. During the elementary cooperative period, the Liu Zhuang cooperative needed a threshing ground, but there was no flat land near the village. After hearing this news, the Forward Cooperative, composed of Hui people, voluntarily found Liu Zhuang Cooperative and exchanged a piece of flat land near Liu Zhuang for them. The members of Liu Zhuang Cooperative wanted to give them more land to express their gratitude, but the Hui members refused, and in the end, they exchanged one mu for one mu. That autumn, the Forward Cooperative couldn't harvest the crops due to a shortage of labor. Seeing that the wind and snow season was approaching, and any further delay would damage the crops, Liu Zhuang Cooperative immediately dispatched ten people, one large cart, and thirty head of livestock to help with the harvesting and transporting. Some Hui members said: "This is truly one family of Hui and Han unity." After the establishment of the commune, this relationship was further developed. Last winter, most of the male labor force from each production team went far away to build water conservancy projects and participate in copper smelting. The Honglian team, more than twenty miles away, was building a reservoir irrigating one hundred and eight mu; because of the shortage of labor, the women of the Honglian team couldn't finish the work. Although the Luotuo Xiang team didn't have much labor, six young Hui women volunteered to go to the Honglian team in the bitter cold and helped build the reservoir until it was completed. When they parted, they held each other's hands like sisters, reluctant to leave. The women of the Honglian team said gratefully: If you have any difficulties in the future, we will definitely come to help. During the Spring Festival this year, the Hui and Han members of the Luotuo Xiang team held an unprecedented grand celebration, and the members of the Honglian team were also invited to participate. Sheds were set up and decorated in the streets, and plays were performed for three whole days, celebrating their leap forward achievements and welcoming even greater victories this year.
　　When we were at the commune, whenever we talked with people, we always heard the same sentence: "Unity is strength, unity is happiness." Every member we met deeply loved the collective, loved the people's commune, and loved this big family of Hui and Han unity. Last year, elementary education greatly developed, and many remote Hui villages lacked teachers. The Han production team transferred teachers from their own villages to Hui villages. The Han teacher Yang Fancheng knew that many people in the Hui villages were still illiterate, so he resolutely went to the remote Jinqi Brigade, where Hui people lived, to become a teacher. After arriving there, he not only actively mobilized Hui children to enroll in school but also frequently visited the students' parents and helped the Hui villages carry out cultural and recreational activities. During this year's spring plowing preparation, he saw that the Hui members were very tired from transporting fertilizer, so he studied with them and helped them build a high-line transportation line on a mountain to transport fertilizer, which could transport fertilizer for more than one hundred and fifty mu per day, increasing fertilizer efficiency by more than ten times and saving a large amount of labor.
　　The Ma Chang team, where Hui people are the majority, has only twelve Han households. In the past, due to the constraints of old habits, the Hui people believed that doing breeding work was not honorable, but in order to develop animal husbandry production, breeders were necessary. Seeing this situation, the Han member Wang Tingjie broke through the difficulties and voluntarily requested to be a breeder. In his first year as a breeder, the team added six mule foals. Wang Tingjie's actions of actively carrying out livestock breeding work in the Hui villages moved many Hui members. They all praised Wang Tingjie's spirit of serving everyone and elected him as the deputy captain of the production brigade and a member of the livestock management committee. Wang Tingjie was loved and respected by the Hui members, and his work became more active. Before the start of spring plowing production this year, many of the team's farm implements were broken. Wang Tingjie checked them one by one and personally led the carpenters in the team's farm implement repair station to repair them. In less than half a month, all the large and small farm implements were completely repaired, ensuring timely spring plowing production.
　　The people's commune has opened up a new path of life for the Hui and Han people. Under the common goal of building a socialist motherland, they are using outstanding labor achievements and soaring enthusiasm to welcome another spring of greater leap forward.

　　友谊之花遍地开
　　谢石言　马玉平
    3月里，我们访问了六盘山以北固原县回汉族人民联合组成的张易人民公社。
    我们到公社，看到墙头、街头到处张贴着回汉族社员歌颂大跃进的诗篇。有一首诗写道：
    群众智慧是源泉，锄头一举诗万卷；
    团结生产大跃进，回汉人民喜开颜。
    早春天气，六盘山上还披着皑皑银装，然而山下的每个山谷、河岸旁，却到处是回汉族社员大闹春耕生产的美丽图景。早晨，太阳刚从山岗上的薄雾中升起，每个山庄回汉族社员就赶着耕牛，扛着耧耙，奔向田野。霎时，每个山沟都卷入了紧张的春播之中。
    沿着一条小河，我们访问了这个公社的黄堡生产大队。这是一个由二百三十七户回民，五十七户汉民组成的生产队。还在1955年初级社的时候，回汉族农民就组成了农业社，其中有一个社取名“团结社”。它刚刚成立，社小力量单薄，牲畜又少，但回汉族社员团结一心克服种种困难。建社第一年，庄稼就获得了大丰收。从农业合作化到成立公社以来，全队回汉族社员，从六盘山谷引水浇灌多少年来干旱的田地，一共修了七条渠道，可以灌地将近四千亩，基本农田全部成为水地。我们看到六盘山消融的雪水，正顺着新开的条条渠道，潺潺流进松软的田地。
    今年这个队的耕作更加细致了。全队六百多亩丰产田，全用套耕的办法，深翻一尺以上，并且实行了“三耕、三磨、三碾”，还打了小畦。社员们把基本农田和大面积丰产田，分为三级，每亩施肥都在两万斤到三万斤，有的丰产田不但施了底肥，播种时还顺犁沟施了一层肥。去年冬天，这些田地大都进行了冬灌，春播前又来了一次春灌。由回汉族老农组成的技术委员会、顾问小组，选出的播种、摆耧能手，播种前对春播进行了全面的技术讨论，制订了播种措施和技术标准。社员们谈到今年精耕细作的情况时，个个眉开眼笑地说：“今年我们都像绣工织女一样，块块田都要描金绣花。”
    在这个公社里，到处都可以看到回汉社员团结生产的动人景象。我们到离黄堡队几十里路外的骆驼基队时，回汉族社员组织的青年突击队，正生龙活虎般地在往丰产田运送肥料。队长郭鸿儒给我们介绍了许多关于这个队回汉社员团结的动人故事。公社化以前，这个队是由六个回汉族山庄的初级社合并建成的高级社。初级社时，刘庄社需要一个打谷场，但靠近村庄没有一块平整土地，回民组成的前进社听到这个消息后，就自动找刘庄社把一块和刘庄相近的平地换给他们，刘庄社的社员为了感谢他们，要多给几亩地，回民社员不肯要，结果就一亩换一亩了。那年秋天，前进社因为劳力少，庄稼收割不回来，眼看风雪季节就要到来，再耽误庄稼就要受损失，刘庄社知道以后，立刻出动了十个人、一辆大车、三十头牲畜，帮助收割和驮运。有的回民社员说：“这真正是回汉团结一家人”。成立公社以后，这种关系得到了进一步发展。去年冬天，各个生产队的大部分男劳动力都远出修水利和参加炼铜去了。相距二十多里路远的红联队当时正兴修一个灌溉一百零八亩的蓄水池；因为劳动力少，红联队的妇女修不过来，骆驼巷队的劳力虽然不多，但有六个回民青年妇女自动报名，在数九寒天到红联队，一直帮助把蓄水池修成。临分别的时候，她们像亲姊妹一样互相拉着手，依依不舍。红联队的妇女们感激地说：以后你们有啥困难，我们一定来帮助。今年过春节的时候，骆驼巷队的回汉族社员举行了一次空前的大联欢，红联队的社员也被邀请来参加。街头上搭棚结彩，整整演了三天戏，庆贺他们跃进的成绩，迎接今年更大的胜利。
    我们在公社的时候，和人们谈起来，总是听到这样一句共同的话：“团结就是力量，团结就是幸福。”我们遇到的每一个社员，他们都是十分热爱集体，热爱人民公社，热爱这个回汉人民团结的大家庭。去年小学教育大发展，许多偏僻的回民村庄缺少教师，汉民生产队就把自己村庄的教师调给回民村庄。汉民教师杨范成知道回民村庄有很多人还是文盲，他就坚决到回民聚居的偏僻的金旗大队当教师。到那里以后，他不但积极动员回民子女入学，还经常访问学生家长，帮助回民村庄开展文化娱乐活动。今年备耕生产中，他看到回民社员运肥很劳累，就共同研究，帮助他们在一座山上架了一条运肥的高线运输线，一天可以运肥一百五十多亩，运肥效率提高了十多倍，节省了大批劳动力。
    回民居多数的马昌队，只有十二户汉民。过去回民因受旧习惯的束缚，认为作配种工作是不光荣的事，但是为了发展畜牧业生产，又不能不要配种员。汉族社员王廷杰看到这种情况，就突破困难，自动要求当配种员。他当配种员第一年，这个队就增加了六个骡驹。王廷杰到回民村庄积极进行牲口配种工作的事迹感动了许多回族社员，他们都连声称赞王廷杰为大家服务的精神。并把他选为生产大队的副队长和牲畜管理委员。王廷杰受到回族社员的爱戴和尊重，工作更加积极了。今年春耕生产开始前，队里的农具有很多坏了，王廷杰就逐一检查，并亲自带领队里农具修配站的木工进行修理，不到半月的时间，大小农具都完全修好，及时保证了春耕生产。
    人民公社化给回汉人民开拓了一条崭新的生活道路。他们在建设社会主义祖国大家庭的共同目标下，正在用出色的劳动成果和以冲天的干劲，迎接着又一个更大跃进的春天。
