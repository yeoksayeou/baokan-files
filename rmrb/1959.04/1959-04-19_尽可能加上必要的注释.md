    Add Necessary Annotations Whenever Possible

    In the news report "Zhouzhi County Comprehensively Encircles and Suppresses Wheat Stripe Rust" on the first edition of April 4th, there was a footnote: "Zhouzhi is pronounced Zhou Zhi (zhōu zhì). Yuanhe Records state: 'A mountain bend is called Zhou, and a water bend is called Zhi.' Zhouzhi County is located in western Shaanxi, bordering the Qinling Mountains to the south and the Wei River to the north, and is named for being surrounded by mountains and rivers." I think this kind of annotation is very good. If the news and articles in the newspaper could add necessary annotations for obscure place names, surnames, and some difficult-to-understand technical terms, how convenient it would be for readers! Recently, there have been more and more such annotations in the People's Daily. However, sometimes there are still some places that need annotations but are not annotated. For example, on the same day, the People's Daily's fourth edition had several reports and articles about Hungary's socialist construction achievements, and several places mentioned the harvest of "per Hold of land." But we don't know how much area one "Hold" actually is, which hinders us from better understanding the achievements of our fraternal country. Yi Fan

    尽可能加上必要的注释
    4月4日第一版上“盩厔县全面围剿小麦条锈病”这篇新闻报道中有一条注释：“盩厔读舟至zhou　zhi，元和志注：‘山曲曰盩，水曲曰厔’，盩厔县在陕西西部，南依秦岭，北濒渭河，因山环水绕而得名。”我觉得这样的注释很好。如果报上的新闻和文章，能够把生僻的地名、姓氏，以及一些不易懂的专门术语等加上必要的注释，对读者的便利是多么大！近来，人民日报上这样的注释越来越多了。但是，有时也还有一些需要注释的地方没有注释。例如在同一天人民日报第四版上有几篇关于匈牙利社会主义建设成就的报道和文章，好几处提到“每霍尔特土地”的收成。但是我们不知道一“霍尔特”的面积究竟是多少，这就妨碍了我们更好地了解兄弟国家的成就。　一凡
