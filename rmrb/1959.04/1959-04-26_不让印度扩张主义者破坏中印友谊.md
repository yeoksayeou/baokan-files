To the Editor:

We greatly cherish the friendly relations between China and India, but we see that these relations are being undermined by some expansionist elements in India. The so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" was disseminated by Indian diplomatic officials. Many Indian newspapers and some politicians are using this "statement" to attack our country, interfere in our internal affairs, and nonsensically claim that our suppression of the rebellion is an attack on "religious freedom." They clamor about "Chinese aggression against Tibet" and advocate allowing Tibetan rebels to openly engage in treasonous activities on Indian soil. This is a blatant violation of the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" advocated by both China and India and is a serious undermining of Sino-Indian friendship.

We solemnly declare: Tibet is an inseparable part of China, and the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is entirely our internal affair, and no outside interference is allowed. We angrily condemn the Indian expansionist elements for interfering in our internal affairs and sternly warn these interferers: Be clear-headed and shut up immediately!

### 不让印度扩张主义者破坏中印友谊

    不让印度扩张主义者破坏中印友谊编辑同志：
    我们非常珍视中印友好关系，但是我们看到，这种关系正在受到来自印度一些扩张主义分子的破坏。所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”是由印度外交官员散发的，印度不少报纸和一些政治家利用这个“声明”攻击我国，干涉我国内政，胡说什么我国平定叛乱是进攻“宗教自由”叫嚣什么“中国侵略西藏”，主张让西藏叛匪在印度土地上公开进行叛国活动，这是公然违背中印两国所倡导的“和平共处五项原则”的，是严重破坏中印友谊的。
    我们庄严表示：西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，平定西藏叛乱完全是我国的内政，绝不容许外人干涉。我们愤怒谴责印度扩张主义分子对我国内政的干涉，严正警告这些干涉者：头脑清醒些，立即住口！
