What the Tibetan upper-class reactionary elements committed – the shameful crime of rebellion – in the eyes of the Indian expansionists, suddenly became an enchanting "revolutionary" great undertaking worthy of "deep sympathy." Look at a resolution passed by the National Executive Committee of the Indian Praja Socialist Party on April 17. This resolution stated that the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet was a "sudden eruption of emotions that had been simmering in secret for the past four years into a people's revolution against those attempting to eliminate Tibet's distinct characteristics – gentleness, self-sufficiency, and non-aggression," and therefore they expressed deep "sympathy" for it.

What beautiful terms! What a beautiful face! But people can't help but ask, what kind of revolution are they making?

Is it against the aggression of foreign imperialism? If not, is it against domestic reactionary rule? One of the two must be the case.

The ringleaders of the Tibetan rebellion were all lackeys fostered by foreign imperialism. The primary figure in this rebellion, the former Chief Kalon of the Tibetan local government, Surkhang Wangchen Gelek, was a typical representative of colluding with foreign countries and betraying the motherland. He bought training methods and weapons from Britain, and tried in every way to facilitate the entry and occupation of Tibet by British imperialism. At the same time, he was also the largest serf owner in Tibet, owning more than 10,000 serfs and collecting more than 30,000 "kets" (one ket is about 25 catties) in rent every year.

What kind of revolution would such a group of people make! Opposition to their own reactionary rule? Opposition to imperialist aggression? Nothing! So, what exactly are they "sympathizing" with?

The barbaric and brutal nature of the reactionary rule in Tibet is world-renowned. The main producers in Tibet, the serfs, own no land at all. Serfs have to spend more than two-thirds of their time each year using their own cattle and farm tools to perform unpaid labor on the land of the serf owners. Serf owners can arbitrarily impose horrific punishments such as gouging out eyes, cutting off noses, pulling out tongues, gouging out hearts, chopping off hands and feet, skinning, and tendon-drawing on serfs. Compared with the "feeding people to beasts" type punishments of medieval Europe, these are even worse.

This fully illustrates how backward, dark, and cruel the serf system was in Tibetan society under the rule of the upper-class reactionary group. This situation is well known even to a newspaper in West Germany, the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung," thousands of miles away from China. This newspaper wrote: "Slavery is still widespread in Tibet"; "Perhaps it can be affirmed that Tibet, under whatever rule, cannot and probably would not want to maintain its medieval state forever." This situation should be even clearer to the politicians of our neighboring country, India, right?

However, the Indian expansionists show such deep "sympathy" and such fervent admiration for this brutal serf system. Well, dear sirs, if that's the case, why don't you also have a "people's revolution" in your own country to promote this extremely lovable system?

Gentlemen of the Indian Praja Socialist Party, since you love this "revolution" so much, why not openly write in your program: "The program of this party is as follows: colluding with foreign countries, betraying the motherland, brutal rule, burning, killing, looting, and raping..." Frankness is the best policy, as the saying goes!

The people of all ethnic groups in China, including the Tibetan people, believe that Tibet should undergo social reform. The seventeen-article agreement between the central government and the Tibetan local government also made clear provisions for this. The Dalai Lama has also expressed his support for this desire for reform more than once. Indian Prime Minister Nehru's conversation with reporters on April 24 served as a witness for him. He said: "When the Dalai Lama came here (referring to India) two or three years ago, he told me that he hoped to implement reforms in Tibet." Anyone who truly "sympathizes with the Tibetan people" should sympathize with their social reforms.

It should be noted that we have always believed that the Tibetan local government should carry out this social reform on its own initiative, and the central government should not force it. This is also clearly stated in the seventeen-article agreement. In 1956, the central government announced to the original Tibetan local government that democratic reforms could not be carried out in Tibet within six years, that is, before 1962.

For the benefit of the Tibetan people and for the prosperity and progress of Tibet, reform is absolutely necessary. But what does this have to do with our neighboring country, India? Didn't the Indian Congress Party recently pass a resolution to carry out land reform? Didn't they say they were going to organize agricultural production cooperatives? Does any other country have the right to interfere with such reforms in India?

    他们“同情”什么
    邹林
    西藏上层反动分子可耻的叛乱罪行，在印度扩张主义分子的眼中，一下变成了值得“深切同情”的迷人的
  “革命”伟业。请看4月17日印度人民社会党全国执行委员会通过的一项决议。这个决议说，西藏上层反动分子的叛乱，是“过去四年来一直暗中沸腾的情绪突然爆发成为反对企图消灭西藏鲜明特性——和善、自给和不侵犯别人——的人民革命”，因而他们对此表示深切“同情”。
    多么动听的名词啊！多么美丽的面孔啊！可是，人们不禁要问，他们是革什么命啊？
    是反对外国帝国主义的侵略吗？不然的话，是反对国内的反动统治吗？二者必居其一。
    西藏叛乱的首脑分子，统统是外国帝国主义所豢养的奴才。这次叛乱的首要分子、原西藏地方政府首席噶伦索康·旺清格勒，就是一个里通外国，背叛祖国的典型的代表。他从英国贩买练兵方法，购买军火武器，处处想给英帝国主义以进入西藏、盘踞西藏的方便。同时，他也是西藏最大的农奴主，拥有农奴一万多人，每年收租达三万多克（一克约二十五市斤）。
    这样的一批人物，他们会革什么命呢！反对自己的反动统治吗？反对帝国主义的侵略吗？什么也不是！那末，“同情”他们的究竟是什么呢？
    西藏反动统治的野蛮残暴，是举世闻名的。西藏的主要生产者农奴，完全没有土地。农奴每年要以三分之二以上时间用自己的耕牛、农具在农奴主的土地上进行无偿劳动。农奴主对农奴可以随意施用挖眼、割鼻、抽舌，剜心，剁手、剁脚、剥皮、抽筋之类骇人听闻的刑罚。如果同“引兽食人”的中世纪欧洲刑罚相比，也是有过之无不及。
    这就充分说明：在西藏上层反动集团统治下的西藏社会制度，是一个多么落后的、黑暗的、残酷的农奴制度。这种情况，甚至在远隔中国好几千公里的西德的一家“法兰克福汇报”也知道得很清楚。这家报纸写道：“西藏还广泛存在着奴隶制”；“也许可以肯定：西藏无论是在哪种统治之下，是不能、而且恐怕也不会想永远保持它的中世纪的状态”。这种情况，对于我们邻国的印度政治家们说来，是应当更清楚的罢？
    但是，印度的扩张主义分子对于这种残暴的农奴制度，却寄以那么深厚的“同情”，给以那么狂热的推崇，好罢，亲爱的先生们，既然如此，你们为什么不在自己的国内也来一次“人民革命”，推行这种万分可爱的制度呢？
    印度人民社会党的先生们，你们既然如此热爱这种“革命”，为什么不在你们的纲领中公开的写道：“本党纲领如下：里通外国，背叛祖国，残暴统治，烧杀抢淫……。”明人不作暗事，此之谓也！
    中国各族人民包括西藏人民在内，都认为西藏是应该进行社会改革的。在中央和西藏地方政府的十七条协议中，也作了明确的规定。这种改革的愿望，达赖喇嘛也不止一次地表示赞成。印度尼赫鲁总理4月24日对记者的谈话，更为他作了证人。他说：“当达赖喇嘛两三年前到这里（指印度）来的时候，他曾对我说，他希望在西藏实行改革”。谁要是真正“同情西藏人”的话，就应该同情他们进行社会改革。
    需要说明的是，这种社会改革，我们一直认为西藏地方政府应自动进行，中央不加强迫。这也有明文载于十七条协议中。1956年，中央曾向原西藏地方政府宣布：在六年以内，即1962年以前，在西藏可以不进行民主改革。
    为了西藏人民的利益，为了西藏的繁荣和进步，改革是完全必要的。但是，这对于邻国的印度来说，又是干卿何事呢？印度国大党不久前不是也通过了要进行土地改革的决议吗？不是说要组织农业生产合作社吗？对于印度的这样的改革，难道别的国也有权干涉么？
