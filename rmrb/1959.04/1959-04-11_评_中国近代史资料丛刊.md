　　Review of "A Collection of Materials on Modern Chinese History"
　　Edited by the Chinese Historical Society, Published by Shanghai People's Publishing House, New Knowledge Publishing House, Shenzhou Guoguang Society
　　Dai Yi
　　The "Collection of Materials on Modern Chinese History" (hereinafter referred to as the "Collection"), edited by the Chinese Historical Society, has published nine kinds from 1951 to now ("Opium War", "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom", "Nian Army", "Hui People's Uprising", "Sino-French War", "Sino-Japanese War", "Wuxu Reform", "Boxer Rebellion", "Xinhai Revolution"), totaling about 20 million words. This is a large-scale historical data collation work. The publication of the "Collection" has played a certain role in promoting the teaching and scientific research of modern history.
　　Providing historical facts and accumulating materials are of great significance to historical science. The task of historical research is to analyze specific historical processes with the Marxist stand, viewpoint, and method, and to reveal the development law of social life and class struggle from the intricate and complex historical facts. Historical workers must first arm themselves with historical materialism to avoid being captured by the chaotic and vast historical materials. At the same time, historical workers must also master accurate and rich historical materials. Only by comprehensively analyzing a large number of historical materials can we understand the true process of history and scientifically summarize objective history, just as Marx said, "Research must collect a wealth of material, analyze its different forms of development, and explore the internal connections of these various forms. Without first completing this work, there can be no proper explanation of the real movement." (Preface to the second edition of "Das Kapital")
　　However, historical workers face many difficulties in mastering modern history materials. Modern history materials are very rich, and their quantity is probably calculated in hundreds of billions of words. People often use "sweating oxen filling houses" to describe the richness of ancient Chinese history books, but due to the development of modern culture and the recent era, the number of modern history materials retained far exceeds that of ancient history books. Researchers are limited by their energy and cannot delve into them one by one. Moreover, modern history materials are very scattered and chaotic, and have not undergone large-scale整理work. Many precious historical materials are covered in dust and buried in piles of paper, unknown to people. This is an important factor hindering the further development of modern history research.
　　The publication of the "Collection" has largely solved the problem of the lack of modern history materials and is helpful for the development of teaching and research work. The "Collection" has the following advantages: First, the editors followed a unified policy, taking class struggle as the clue, and provided a large amount of information about modern revolutionary movements. Although due to the limitations of data sources, the "Collection" can only record many reactionary records, the editors' political inclination can be seen through the preface, bibliography annotations, editor's notes, arrangement methods, and even the "People's Anti-Qing Struggle" column compiled from scattered materials in "Xinhai Revolution". Historical materials are generally records of class struggle. Even for the most preliminary整理work, the issue of position should be the first to be noted, otherwise, one will inevitably fall into the errors of objectivism or trivialism.
　　Second, the editing method of the "Collection" generally adopts the editing method of encyclopedias, that is, dividing modern history into several major events, combining them into a collection, and dividing each album into several related categories according to the development of the event. Various historical materials are attached to different categories according to their content. Although this editing method sometimes inevitably splits a complete work, from the perspective of using historical materials, in order to control a large amount of data with different contents, so that it is coherently connected and clearly categorized, the method of compiling by category is necessary.
　　Third, the editors of the "Collection" carried out hard work in collecting, selecting, excerpting, punctuating, and collating. According to the editors of "Boxer Rebellion", they browsed more than 300 kinds of historical materials, but only selected 48 kinds, which shows the arduousness of the整理work. In particular, many historical materials have many defects due to official deletions and blurred errors in printing and copying. The editors sought various versions for collation, or directly extracted and supplemented them from the archives. This work is very beneficial to the utilization and research of historical materials.
　　Fourth, the editors generally no longer selected materials that had been printed in large quantities. Therefore, many of the materials collected in the "Collection" are unpublished manuscripts, rarely circulated printed books, and original archives. The publication of these rare books alone is a great encouragement to researchers. In the era of reactionary rule, these rare materials were either in the hands of a few people or buried in old paper piles, and the general public and historical workers had no chance to see them at all; only in the new China where the people are the masters of the country, only with the strong support of the Party and the state and the gradual improvement of the ideological awareness of many bibliophiles, can these valuable materials be整理out and made public to the world, becoming the common property of all the people.
　　Because the "Collection" has collected rich and valuable materials and collated them, it has high research value; on the other hand, it has also undergone preliminary selection and a certain arrangement, has a certain political inclination and order, and can also be used as a general reference for teaching.
　　Of course, there are also some aspects of the editing work of the "Collection" that are worth discussing. In terms of the overall system, the "Collection" attaches great importance to the historical materials of each revolutionary climax and war, which is correct, but it completely ignores the historical materials of the revolutionary low tide period. Everyone knows that class struggle is constant, but it only forms revolutionary climaxes and armed conflicts at specific times. Although the revolutions and wars in modern history are particularly high-spirited and frequent, they can never replace the overall situation of historical development. Taking the history of imperialist aggression against China as an example, on the one hand, there were open armed aggressions such as the Opium War, the Sino-French War, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Eight-Power Allied Forces. On the other hand, even in peaceful times, imperialism gradually penetrated its aggressive forces into China through various diplomatic means, and the Chinese people also had countless spontaneous and regional resistance struggles. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire process of imperialist aggression against China, various diplomatic negotiations and people's anti-foreign religion materials are indispensable. Unfortunately, the "Collection" did not provide anything in these areas. Similar situations can be cited a lot, such as the evolution of various systems, the living conditions of the people, secret societies, the development of border areas, the social conditions of ethnic minorities, the division of spheres of influence by imperialism, etc., all need to be supplemented.
　　There are also some aspects of the specific compilation and selection of the "Collection" that can be discussed. Most of the albums are classified according to the content of the historical materials, but the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" album is mainly classified according to the source of the materials (divided into revolutionary records, Qing records, foreign records, etc.), the "Wuxu Reform" album considers the content of the historical materials, but focuses on the form of the historical materials (divided into monographs, imperial edicts, memorials, letters, etc.), and the classification of the "Nian Army" album is too general. In the above three albums, the contents included under the same category are too complex, making it inconvenient for readers to browse. Moreover, the materials compiled and selected in each volume also have problems of omission, repetition, or redundancy. For example, most of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" includes Qing official private records, and focuses on the Jiangzhe battlefield that was opened up very late, while the materials about the main battlefield of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom--Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei--are very few, so it is impossible to reflect the full picture of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. For example, the information about the Shanghai Small Sword Society goes beyond the scope of this volume and should be compiled into another album with the Heaven and Earth Society and Small Sword Society of Fujian and Guangdong. The "Nian Army" does not include any memorials, which is also worth considering. Because only local materials are selected and even the most important memorials are completely rejected, this makes this volume of materials seem very scattered. Since the diplomatic archives in the "Sino-French War" and "Sino-Japanese War" volumes have been selected, it is better to strive for perfection. As they are now, the archives after selection still have more than 1.2 million words, which can easily make readers daunted. The "Collection" is basically close to the nature of an encyclopedia and cannot be overly demanding. As for the complete publication of the archives, it should belong to another special book. In addition, the "Sino-Japanese War" lacks a column on all levels of opposition to the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the "Wuxu Reform" completely excludes important academic works, the "Boxer Rebellion" data is completely concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhili, and Shandong, and the anti-imperialist struggle in other provinces (especially the Northeast) is not given attention, the "Xinhai Revolution" lacks the anti-American struggle in 1905 and the recovery of road rights and mining rights movements in various places, and the opposing opinions and activities in the debate between Min Bao and Xinmin Congbao are not properly recorded, etc. These shortcomings should be avoided as much as possible for a systematic collection of materials.
　　Finally, the "bibliography annotations" attached to some materials are very interesting. The "bibliography annotations" introduce a large number of materials that are not included in the "Collection", which opens up readers' horizons and makes them understand the general situation of the current materials on related topics, which is very meaningful. Unfortunately, these "bibliography annotations" are still just straightforward introductions, with very few insightful comments, and the introductions are mostly too brief. In order to improve the quality of historical material整理work, it is a good direction for future material work to conduct a comprehensive introduction and commentary on the materials based on Marxist principles, and to explain the source, nature, and value of the materials from the social relations at that time. When compiling the Siku Quanshu 200 years ago, a huge Siku Quanshu General Catalogue Summary was produced, which became a beacon for later scholars to seek knowledge. With the increasing prosperity of the cultural undertakings of the new China and the continuous development of the整理and publication of various classics, a new type of ancient book summary compiled with Marxism is obviously also very necessary. I hope to promote and develop the form of "bibliography annotations" in the future, and gradually prepare conditions for compiling a new type of ancient book summary.

　　评“中国近代史资料丛刊”
　　中国史学会主编　上海人民出版社、新知识出版社、神州国光社出版
　　戴逸
    中国史学会主编的“中国近代史资料丛刊”（以下简称“丛刊”），从1951年到现在，已经出版了九种（“鸦片战争”、“太平天国”、“捻军”、“回民起义”、“中法战争”、“中日战争”、“戊戍变法”、“义和团”、“辛亥革命”），共约两千万字。这是一桩规模较大的史料整理工作。“丛刊”的出版对于近代史的教学和科学研究工作起了一定的推动作用。
    提供史实，积累材料，对于历史科学具有非常重要的意义。历史研究的任务是要用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，来分析具体历史过程，从错综复杂的史实中间揭露社会生活和阶级斗争的发展规律。历史工作者首先必须用历史唯物主义来武装自己，以免被纷乱浩繁的史料所俘虏。同时，历史工作者又必须掌握确切而丰富的史料。只有对大量史料进行了综合和分析，才有可能洞察历史的真实过程，才有可能对客观历史进行科学的概括，正像马克思所说，“研究必须搜集丰富的材料，分析它的不同的发展形态，并探寻出这各种形态的内部联系。不先完成这种工作，便不能对于现实的运动，有适当的说明。”（“资本论”第二版跋）
    但是，历史工作者在掌握近代史资料方面却存在着许多困难。近代史资料十分丰富，其数量大概要以百亿千亿字计。人们常用“汗牛充栋”来形容中国古代史书的丰富，可是由于近代文化发达和时代较近的关系，保留下来的近代史资料的数量还要远超过古代史书。研究工作者限于精力，势不能一一涉猎。并且，近代史资料又很分散、杂乱，没有经过大规模的整理工作，许多珍贵史料，秽积尘封，埋藏在纸堆里，不为人所闻知。这是妨碍近代史研究工作进一步开展的重要因素。
    “丛刊”的出版，在很大程度上解决了近代史资料缺乏的问题，有助于教学和研究工作的开展。“丛刊”具有以下几个优点：第一，编者们遵循着统一的方针，以阶级斗争作为线索，提供了有关近代革命运动的大量资料。尽管由于资料来源的限制，“丛刊”中还只能录入许多反动方面的记载，但是通过序言、书目解题、按语、编排方法以至像“辛亥革命”中从零散资料汇辑的“人民反清斗争”专栏，都可以看出编者们的政治倾向性。历史资料一般都是阶级斗争的记录，即使进行最初步的整理工作，立场问题也是首先应该注意的，否则必将陷入客观主义或烦琐主义的错误。
    第二，“丛刊”编辑方法大体上采用了类书的编辑方法，即把近代历史分成若干重大事件，合则成为丛刊，分则成为专辑，每个专辑又按照事件的发展区分成相互联系的若干类目，各种史料分别按照其内容而系于不同的类目之中。这种编辑方法虽然有时不免要把一本完整著作割裂开来，但是从利用史料的角度来看，为了驾驭大量不同内容的资料，使之绳联玉贯、条目分明，按类编纂的方法是必要的。
    第三，“丛刊”的编者们在搜集、选择、摘录、标点、校勘方面进行了辛勤的劳动。仅据“义和团”的编者说，他们涉猎了三百多种史料，而仅仅选录了四十八种，由此即可见整理工作的艰巨性。特别是许多史料因经过官方的删改和因印刷抄写的模糊讹错，缺陷甚多，编者们多方觅求各种本子进行校勘，或者直接从档案中抽补，这种工作对于史料的利用和研究是非常有益的。
    第四，编者们对于曾经大量印行过的资料，一般不再选录，因此，“丛刊”中所收集的很多是未经刊刻的抄本、流传很少的印本和原始档案。单是这些稀见本的刊行，对于研究工作者就是一种很大的鼓舞。在反动统治时代，这种稀见资料或者掌握在少数人手中，或者埋藏在旧纸堆中，广大群众和一般历史工作者根本没有见到的机会；只有在人民当家作主的新中国，只有在党和国家的大力支持以及许多藏书家的思想觉悟逐步提高的今天，这些珍贵资料才会被整理出来和公之于世，成为全体人民的共同财产。
    由于“丛刊”一方面搜集了丰富和珍贵的资料，并进行了校勘，所以它具有较高的研究价值；另一方面，它又经过初步的选择和一定的编排，具有一定的政治倾向性和条理性，也可以作为教学上一般参考之用。
    当然，“丛刊”的编辑工作也还有值得商榷的地方。在总的体例方面，“丛刊”很重视每次革命高潮和战争的史料，这是正确的，可是它对于革命低潮时期的史料却完全忽略了。大家都知道，阶级斗争是经常存在的，但是只有在特定的时间内才会形成革命高潮和武装冲突。近代史上的革命和战争虽然特别高昂和频繁，但是它们也总不能代替历史发展的全局。拿帝国主义侵略中国的历史来说，一方面固然有鸦片战争、中法战争、中日战争、八国联军等公开的武装侵略，另一方面即使在和平年代，帝国主义也通过了各种外交手段，逐步地把侵略势力渗入中国，中国人民也相应地有无数自发的、地区性的反抗斗争。因此，从帝国主义侵略中国的整个过程说来，各种外交交涉和人民反洋教的史料就是不可缺少的。可惜“丛刊”在这些方面没有提供什么东西。类似的情况还可以举出不少，如各种制度的演变、人民的生活状况、秘密会党、边疆地区的开发、少数民族的社会情况、帝国主义划分势力范围等方面的资料，都还需要加以补充。
    “丛刊”在具体的编选方面也有可以商榷的地方。多数专辑都是按照史料的内容来分类的，可是，“太平天国”专辑却主要按照资料的来源分类（分成革命方面记载、清方记载、外人记载等），“戊戍变法”专辑虽然考虑了史料内容，但是偏重于史料的形式（分成专著、上谕、奏议、书牍等），“捻军”专辑的分类也过于笼统。以上三个专辑，在同一类目之下，收录的内容太庞杂，读者翻检不便。并且，各辑编选的资料也有遗漏、重复或冗长的毛病。例如，“太平天国”中所收录的大多是清方私人记载，又偏重在很晚才开辟的江浙战场方面，而有关太平天国的主要战场——安徽、江西、湖北方面的资料却反而很少，这样就不可能反映太平天国的全貌。又如，有关上海小刀会资料更是越出了该辑的范围，应该和福建、两广的天地会、小刀会另编专辑。“捻军”中对于奏议一概不录，这也是值得考虑的。由于只选地方性资料而连最重要的奏议也完全摈弃了，这就使这一辑资料显得很零散。“中法战争”和“中日战争”两辑中的外交档案，既然是经过了选录的，那就不妨精益求精，而像现在那样经过选录以后的档案，仍有一百二十多万字，易使读者望而生畏。“丛刊”基本上接近于类书的性质，不能过分求全求备；至于档案的全部刊布，应该另属专书。此外，“中日战争”中缺少各阶层反对签订马关条约的专栏，“戊戍变法”完全不录重要的学术著作，“义和团”的资料完全集中在京、津、直隶、山东，而对于其他各省的反帝斗争（特别是东北）未予重视，“辛亥革命”中缺少1905年的反美斗争和各地的收回路权矿权运动，在民报与新民丛报的论战中也未适当著录反对派的言论和活动，等等。这些缺点，作为一个系统的资料集来说是应该尽量避免的。
    最后，有些资料所附的“书目解题”，很能引起人们的兴趣。“书目解题”内介绍了大量未被录入“丛刊”的资料，使读者的视野豁然开朗，了解到有关专题目前资料的大体情况，这是非常有意义的。可惜这些“书目解题”还只是平铺直叙的介绍，很少有高瞻远瞩的评论，而且介绍也大多太简略些。为了提高史料整理工作的质量，根据马克思主义的原则，对资料进行全面的介绍和评论，从当时的社会关系中阐明资料的来源、性质和价值，这不失为今后资料工作的一个方向。二百年前编纂四库全书的时候，曾经产生了一部巨大的四库全书总目提要，成为后代学者寻求知识的津梁。随着新中国文化事业的日益繁荣和各种典籍整理出版工作的不断开展，一部用马克思主义编写的古籍提要显然也是十分需要的。我希望今后推广和发扬“书目解题”的形式，逐步为编写一本新型的古籍提要准备条件。
