Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th: The Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Council of Ministers announced today that in the first quarter of this year, Soviet industry completed 105% of the state production plan. Compared with the same period last year, the total industrial output value of the country increased by 11%, and the production of some important industrial sectors increased even more. For example, the output value of the machine manufacturing and metal processing industry increased by 13%, and the output value of the building materials industry increased by 25%.

The Soviet Council of Ministers' Central Statistical Bureau's communique was published in various newspapers today. The communique pointed out that the socialist competition enthusiastically launched by employees in various industrial sectors of the Soviet Union to realize the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union guaranteed the smooth completion of the Soviet Union's industrial production plan for the first quarter of this year.

In the first quarter, all Soviet republics completed the total industrial output value plan and the production plans for most extremely important industrial products. The quarterly industrial production plans of all National Economic Councils were overfulfilled.

The communique stated that in the first quarter of this year, the production plans of many products in the Soviet heavy industry sector and consumer goods industry were overfulfilled. According to the materials provided in the communique, the growth rate of many products was significantly higher than the average growth rate of the entire industry. For example, compared with the same period last year, in the first quarter of this year, the output of gas, steel pipes, cement, prefabricated reinforced concrete components and parts, sugar, meat products, and whole milk products increased by 28%, 15%, 18%, 39%, 35%, 46%, and 27% respectively.

In the first quarter of this year, the Soviet Union produced a total of 10.5 million tons of pig iron, 14.5 million tons of steel, 11.4 million tons of steel products, 22.6 million tons of iron ore, 126 million tons of coal, 29.8 million tons of oil, 9.2 billion cubic meters of gas, 56.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 1.495 billion square meters of various textiles, 95 million pairs of leather shoes, and 1.6 million tons of sugar.

Compared with the first quarter of last year, pig iron increased by nearly one million tons, steel increased by 1.2 million tons, steel products increased by 740,000 tons, coal increased by 4.15 million tons, oil increased by 3.4 million tons, electricity increased by more than 6 billion kilowatt-hours, textiles increased by 66 million square meters, and leather shoes increased by nearly 8 million pairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th: With the development of the Seven-Year Plan construction work, the "Communist Labor Brigade" movement in the Soviet Union is now developing more deeply. This mass movement, which expresses the Soviet people's desire to accelerate the construction of a communist society, has recently added a new dimension: many workers have put forward the slogan of striving to become "Communist Labor Shock Workers."

The slogan of striving to become a "Communist Labor Shock Worker" was put forward under the following circumstances: After the vigorous development of the "Communist Labor Brigade" movement, almost all factories in the Soviet Union had a portion of workers who were unable to participate in this movement because their work nature determined that they could only work alone. Thus, a question arose before them: could they not put forward a communist slogan for themselves because they did individual work? Of course not. Therefore, they put forward the slogan of striving to become "Communist Labor Shock Workers."

The workers of the "Red Presnya" factory in Moscow were one of the first factories to launch the movement to strive to become "Communist Labor Shock Workers." Klimov, a boring machine worker in this factory who works alone, put forward the slogan that individuals should "work, study, and live in the spirit of communism." He guaranteed that his individual Seven-Year Plan would be completed in six years, and that he would intensify his studies to reach the cultural level of a secondary technical school. In his work, he would teach three apprentices well and put forward at least two rationalization proposals.

Klimov's initiative was quickly responded to by other workers in the factory. Veteran workers Nurimanov and Stalchinov proposed that they should strive to complete their individual Seven-Year Plans in five and a half years, cultivate ten apprentices each in seven years, and vigorously help young workers.

The "Red Presnya" factory also challenged the employees of other factories in Moscow, calling on them to participate in the movement to strive to become "Communist Labor Shock Workers." (The right picture shows a open hearth workshop of the Zaporozhye Steel Plant) (Attached picture)

    苏联七年计划第一个春天高奏凯歌
    首季工业生产计划超额完成　重要工业品产量显著增长
    广大职工热情高涨争作共产主义劳动突击手
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联部长会议中央统计局今天宣布，今年第一季度苏联工业完成了国家生产计划105％。和去年同期比较，全国工业总产值增加了11％，一些重要工业部门的生产增加得更多，例如，机器制造和金属加工工业的产值增加了13％，建筑材料工业产值增加了25％。
    此间各报今天发表了苏联部长会议中央统计局的公报。公报指出，苏联各工业部门职工热烈展开的争取实现苏共第二十一次代表大会决议的社会主义竞赛，保证了苏联今年第一季度工业生产计划的顺利完成。
    在第一季度里，苏联所有加盟共和国都完成了工业总产值计划和大多数极重要的工业产品的生产计划。所有国民经济委员会的季度工业生产计划都超额完成了。
    公报说，今年第一季度，苏联重工业部门的许多产品和消费品工业的生产计划都是超额完成的。根据公报提供的材料，有许多产品的增长速度大大高于全国整个工业的平均增长速度。例如，和去年同期比较，今年第一季度瓦斯、钢管、水泥、预装配钢筋混凝土构件和部件、砂糖、肉类制品和全乳制品的产量就分别增加了28％、15％、18％、39％、35％、46％和27％。
    今年第一季度，苏联总共生产了一千零五十万吨生铁、一千四百五十万吨钢、一千一百四十万吨钢材、两千二百六十万吨铁矿砂、一亿二千六百万吨煤、二千九百八十万吨石油、九十二亿立方公尺瓦斯、五百六十八亿度电力、十四亿九千五百万平方公尺各种纺织品、九千五百万双皮鞋、一百六十万吨砂糖。
    和去年第一季度比较，生铁增加了将近一百万吨，钢——一百二十万吨，钢材——七十四万吨，煤——四百一十五万吨，石油——三百四十万吨，电力——六十多亿度，纺织品——六千六百万平方公尺，皮鞋——将近八百万双。
    新华社莫斯科14日电　随着七年计划建设工作的展开，苏联的“共产主义劳动队”运动现在发展得日益深入了。这个表达了苏联人民加快建设共产主义社会的心愿的群众运动，最近又增添了一项新的内容，许多工人提出了争取做“共产主义劳动突击手”的口号。
    争取做“共产主义劳动突击手”的口号是在这样的情况下提出来的：“共产主义劳动队”运动蓬勃展开以后，几乎苏联所有的工厂中都有一部分工人没有能够参加这一运动，因为他们的工作性质决定了他们只能单人工作。这样，在他们面前就出现了一个问题，难道因为做单人工作就不能给自己提出一个共产主义的口号吗？当然不是。于是，他们就提出了争取做“共产主义劳动突击手”的口号。
    莫斯科“红色普列斯尼雅”工厂的工人是首先发起争取作“共产主义劳动突击手”运动的工厂之一。这个工厂的搪床工人克里莫夫是单独工作的，他提出个人要“按照共产主义的精神来工作、学习和生活”的口号。他保证他个人的七年计划要在六年内完成，并加紧学习，争取达到中等技术学校的文化水平。在工作上，他要教好三个徒弟，并且至少提出两条合理化建议。
    克里莫夫的这一倡议，很快就得到这个工厂的其他工人的响应。老工人努里马诺夫和斯塔尔钦诺夫提出，要争取在五年半内完成个人的七年计划，七年中每个人要培养出十个徒弟，并且要大力帮助青年工人。
    “红色普列斯尼雅”工厂还向莫斯科其他工厂的职工提出挑战，号召他们参加争取做“共产主义劳动突击手”的运动。（右图为萨坡罗什炼钢厂一个平炉车间）（附图片）
