    A Day of Sowing Corn
    —A Glimpse of Field Production Organization in the Shigezhuang Production Team
    By Our Correspondent Rui Yingjie
    Just as the east was turning white, more than a hundred members of the Shigezhuang Production Team of the Houyi People's Commune in Baxian County, Hebei Province, pulled carts, harnessed plows, and carried iron hoes, streaming from the village towards the fields in all directions. Upon reaching the fields, they didn't stop, but hurriedly unloaded seeds from the carts, harnessed the plows, and began working according to the assigned tasks. One person plowed, another spread manure, another planted seeds... Near and far, the fields were immediately filled with clusters of busy people. The sowing work began early in the morning.
    Yesterday after dinner, the team held a meeting of the squad leaders to discuss corn sowing. Wu Guangti, the team's Party branch secretary, and He Jianzhang, the production team leader, proposed whether to launch a "shock week," concentrating efforts to finish sowing all 1,251 mu of spring corn ahead of schedule within seven days. First, spring corn is the team's main food crop, and planting it one day earlier means a greater chance of an early harvest and a larger yield. Second, they had to be determined to snatch the mobile red banner from the Li Fengxian Production Team of the commune. Which squad leader didn't have this ambition! They all unanimously agreed. Immediately, each squad calculated how much they had to complete each day, how many plows to use, and how much labor to invest, based on the acreage of spring corn to be planted. What were the specifications? The production team required 2,300 plants per mu (not counting interplanted beans), a row spacing of 1.8 chi, and nine seedlings every two *gong*. In deeply plowed fields, use drills or plows to plant in furrows; in fields that haven't been deeply plowed, the method everyone discussed was to plow out furrows and then use iron hoes to dig holes, then plant seeds in the holes. Although this was a bit more work, the soil would be looser and better at retaining moisture and seedlings. Someone at the meeting also proposed launching a competition between squads, comparing speed and quality, and seeing who came out on top after seven days. Wang Zhilin, the second squad leader, went back after the meeting and immediately gathered the members to discuss: which plot to plant first, which plot to plant later, who would be in which group, who would hold the plow, who would spread manure. They also agreed: go to the fields at five in the morning, and eat breakfast and lunch in the fields, so that they would definitely do more work than other teams. But they never expected that when Wang Zhilin and the others got up early this morning, they found that other teams had gotten up even earlier than they had. After all, who didn't know that starting early could mean planting two more mu! They rushed to the fields as if in a race, and started working with their plows. Now, Wang Zhilin is wearing only a small jacket, driving the plow, covered in sweat, pulling the plow for 240 *gong* in one breath, while also directing the people.
    At this time, production team leader He Jianzhang was helping the third squad plow furrows. He was responsible for this squad. In the morning, he arrived even earlier than the members, helping the squad's agriculture officer, He Jianlin, divide the plot into three sections, with one set of plows responsible for each section. After the lines were drawn, the members arrived at the field, and He Jianzhang immediately began plowing. This young man is quite strong, and when it comes to heavy labor, he can match anyone. But when it comes to this technical work, the animals in front aren't very cooperative, and the plowing isn't very fast. But why are the people digging holes not keeping up? Three people were digging holes behind each set of plows—this was the ratio that everyone had discussed last night. Now, a round trip is being missed in the time it takes to smoke a cigarette. He put down the plow and looked back, the young men digging holes were working hard, digging and turning the soil over and patting it down, which was indeed intense. The people planting seeds behind them seemed more relaxed, always having time to rest. Also, look at the way they were planting, not grabbing three or four seeds at a time, but grabbing a large handful and scattering ten or so seeds at a time. Wasn't this a waste of seeds? He Jianzhang looked and thought, and talked to He Zhongmin, the squad leader who was spreading manure, about this matter. He Zhongmin looked up and realized that it was indeed poorly organized. During the break, he gathered the members to discuss it. Old member Sun Baoming said that this was a bit of a waste of time, and the efficiency was not high. He believed that one more person should be added to each plow—four people—and one person should follow every two sets of hoes to plant seeds. Moreover, he said, "Those planting seeds must grab three or four seeds at a time; more than that is a waste." The squad leader reorganized the labor force according to this suggestion, and this time everyone was in sync. He Jianzhang plowed for a while longer, watching the order improve a lot. Now he wanted to go to the fifth squad in the east to see if they also had this situation. He walked and calculated that with this change, one set of plows could plant three or four more mu than before.
    At this time, Party branch secretary Wu Guangti was rushing from the fourth squad's field to the first squad's field. He had been digging holes in the fourth squad, and from a distance he saw that the two people digging holes in one squad were not even bending over, but were running forward, how could they dig well? When he went over to take a look, they hadn't even dug an inch deep. Wu Guangti told them that digging so shallow would not achieve the purpose of loosening the soil and retaining moisture. He took the shovel, dug a pillow deep, turned the soil over, and patted it down, while demonstrating and explaining why it was necessary to do so. The two young men smiled and said: We were doing it like this just now, but we got more and more anxious and just wanted to win the red banner. The secretary said: "Is winning the banner more important or producing a thousand catties per mu more important? Besides, if the quality of planting isn't good, you won't be able to win the banner at all." The two stuck out their tongues, bent over, and then dug deeply. Squad leader Wu Haishen came over, and Wu Guangti said that it is not enough for our cadres to participate in production just to play the role of labor; we should always pay attention to directing production. Labor problems and quality problems, relying solely on "three guarantees and one reward" is not enough, we must constantly pay attention to discovering and solving problems in practice, so that we can effectively organize production.
    Wu Guangti and He Jianzhang exchanged information at the field head: It seems that these squads are very motivated to compete; however, there are still problems in the field organization of production. You can't be too superstitious about a set of systems defined in the office, because there will inevitably be some discrepancies between the system and reality. It seems that more rationally allocating labor in the field and closely paying attention to quality are two major issues. Also, the fertilizer is not being spread evenly in many places, and a lot of fertilizer remains at the bottom of the piles, so the seedlings will be high in some places and short in others. Should we find the squad leaders again in the evening to discuss and share information… The two were discussing when agriculture officer Wu Zengli came over from the cornfield in the distance with a five-foot pole. He said that he had walked through several squads' plots and checked, and the row spacing and plant spacing were generally in line with specifications. Some groups, the quality at the head of the field was good, but the quality in the middle was worse, and the agricultural technicians of each squad were responsible for checking and solving the problems as they went along. He Jianzhang said that in order to emphasize quality, he would propose at the evening meeting that quality be the first condition for the competition. Saying this, he quickly returned to the third squad, and the secretary returned to the fourth squad and continued to work.
    After dinner, the squad leaders and agricultural officers immediately went to the team headquarters to meet. The secretary and the team leader each talked about the problems they had discovered and solved in the day's production, and put forward the opinions they had researched. The squad leaders all agreed. Then they talked about the situation and gathered today's results: In addition to the fourth squad, the other four squads planted a total of 150 mu. At this rate, the seven-day plan could be completed in six days. But why hasn't the fourth squad leader, Wu Guangxiao, arrived yet? Everyone guessed: This guy must be working overtime! Sure enough, at this moment, the members of the fourth squad were still in the fields. They planted more than 40 mu of this plot today, and there were still 5 mu left unfinished when it got dark. Many members proposed to finish planting it in a rush, so they wouldn't have to come again tomorrow. Wu Guangxiao agreed and worked with the members until it was completely dark. Now, as soon as he entered the door of the team headquarters, everyone started talking: "Working overtime is not a good skill, we won't admit defeat when we evaluate." The secretary said: "There's a little bit left, and the members asked to finish it in a rush, this is not intentional overtime." The squad leaders laughed when they heard this. (Attached picture)

    播种玉米的一天
    ——石各庄生产队田间组织生产一瞥
    本报记者　芮英杰
    东边刚发白，河北省霸县后奕人民公社石各庄生产队的一百多个社员就拉着车、套着犁、扛着铁铣，一伙一伙地从村里涌向四面八方的田野。到地头上，人们一停也没停，赶忙从车上卸下种子，套好犁杖，按着既定的分工忙了起来。前边一犁过，后边撒粪的撒粪、点种的点种……。远处近处，田野顿时布满了一簇簇紧张忙碌的人群。一大早，播种工作就都开始了。
    昨天晚饭后队上开过小队长会议，研究玉米播种的事情。队支部书记武广提和生产队长何建章提议，是不是来个突击周，集中力量在七天内把一千二百五十一亩春玉米全部提前播完。一来，春玉米是全队的主要粮食作物，早种一天，就多一分早收、多收的把握；二来，得立志把公社插在李奉先生产队的流动红旗夺过来。小队长们谁没有这个雄心！都异口同声地赞成。当下，各个小队都根据要种的春玉米亩数，把每一天得完成多少、得用多少张耠子、投入多少劳力的账算了又算。规格呢？生产队的要求是一亩（间种豆子不算）两千三百棵、一尺八寸一个垄、两弓远九棵苗。在深翻的地里使耧耩或者是耠沟点种；在没有深翻的地里，大伙儿商量的办法是耠出沟来以后，后边再使铁铣掘个穴，然后在穴里点种，这虽然费点事，可是土更松、保墒又保苗。会上还有人提议开展小队之间的竞赛，比时间、比质量，七天以后看高低。二小队队长王之林开罢会回去，马上把社员们找到一块儿商量：先种那块、后种那块，谁和谁一组、谁扶耠子、谁撒粪。他们还商量好：早上五点就下地，早饭、午饭都在地里吃，这样一定比别的队多出活儿。可是万万没有想到，王之林他们今天大早起来一看，别的队比他们起得还早。本来嘛，谁不知道挂点早就能多种二亩地！他们好像赛跑一样急忙赶到地里，插起耠子就干开了。现在，王之林身上只穿件小褂，驾着耠子，满头大汗，二百四十弓的地段一口气拉到头，一边拉还一边指挥着人们。
    这时候，生产队长何建章正在第三小队扶耠子耠沟。他分工包管这个小队。早晨，他比社员们来得更早，帮助小队农业股长何建林把这地段划成三节，一套耠子负责一节地。把线划完，社员们才到地，何建章又马上扶着耠子耠起来了。他这小伙子，体格倒是挺壮，要是干粗拉活计满能一个顶一个。干这技术活儿，前边的牲口也不受使，耠的并不是很快的。可是，为什么后边掘穴的人总跟不上来呢？一张耠子后边三个人掘穴，这是昨天晚上大伙儿研究的比例。现在，抽一根烟的工夫就丢下了一个来回。他把耠子放下，回过来看了看，掘穴的几个小伙子干得很起劲，掘一下，把土翻过来还要拍一下，确是紧张。后边那点种的人倒轻快，总有歇着的空儿。还有，你看那点种的法儿，不是一次抓三四个粒，而是一回抓一大把，一撒手就是十来粒。这不是浪费种子吗？何建章看着想着，找到正在撒粪的小队长何中敏谈了这件事。何中敏抬头一看，可不是，组织得就是不好。休息时间，把社员们找到一块儿商量。老社员孙宝明说，这样就是有点窝工，效率不高。他认为，一张犁后边再增加一个掘穴的——放四个人，每两张铣后头跟着一个人点种就够了。而且，他说：“点种的一定要一回捏三四个粒，多了白搭。”小队长按照这个意见重新布置了力量，这回干起来都接上趟了。何建章又扶了一会儿耠子，看着秩序好多了。现在他要到东边的五小队看看，是不是也有这种情况。他走着算着，这么一改，一套犁能比原来多种三四亩地。
    这时候，支部书记武广提从四小队的地里奔向一小队来了。他刚才在四小队掘穴，打远处就看见一队掘穴的那两个人连腰也不弯，一个劲地往前跑，那能掘得好吗？过去一看，掘的还没一寸深。武广提告诉他们，掘这样浅就达不到松土、保墒的目的。他把锨拿过来，掘下一枕深，把土翻个懒身，又拍一下，一边做着样子，一边解说为什么要这样做。两个小伙子笑了，说：刚才我们也是这样干的，只是越干越急，总想夺红旗。支书说：“是夺旗要紧还是亩产一千斤要紧？再说，质量种不好，也根本夺不来红旗。”两个人伸伸舌头、弯下腰，这才深深地掘开了。小队长吴海深走过来了，武广提说，咱们干部参加生产，光起个劳动力的作用是不够的，应该时刻注意指挥生产。劳力问题、质量问题，光靠有了“三包一奖”还不行，还得在实践当中不断注意发现和解决问题，这才能把生产切实组织好。
    武广提和何建章在地头上交换了一下情况：看这几个小队竞赛的劲头是很足；不过在田间组织生产方面看来还有问题。对于在办公室里定的一套制度不能过于迷信，因为制度和实际总免不掉有点出入。看来在田间更合理地支配劳力和严密注意质量是两个大事。还有那施肥，很多地方撒得不匀，肥堆底子剩得很大，将来苗子出来就会高一块矮一块的。晚上是不是找小队长们再研究一下，碰碰情况……俩人正在研究，农业股长武增利拿着个五尺杆从远处玉米地里插过来了。他说，走了几个小队的地块、检查了一遭，行距、株距一般还都符合规格。有的组，地头质量好、当中差一些，已由各小队农业技术人员负责随检查随解决了。何建章说，为把质量强调一下，晚上开会要提议把质量作为竞赛的头一个条件。说着，他又快步地返回三小队，支书回到第四小队，接着干开了。
    晚饭后，小队长和农业股长们马上就到队部碰头。支书和队长分别把白天生产当中发现解决的问题说了一下，提出了他们研究出的那些意见。小队长们都同意。接着说了说情况，汇集了今天的战果：除第四小队外，其他四个队一共播种一百五十亩。照这样，七天计划六天就能完成。可是，第四小队长武广孝为什么现在还没来？大伙儿猜测着：这家伙准是“加夜班”哪！果然，就在这时候，四小队的社员们还在地里，他们今天种的这块地四十多亩，傍黑时差五亩没完。好多社员提议突击种完它，省得明天再来一遭，武广孝同意了，一直跟社员们一起干到天大黑。现在他刚一进队部的门，大伙儿就说开了：“加班不算好本事，评比时我们不认输。”支书说：“剩下一点，社员要求突击完，这不是有意的加班。”小队长们听这样说，就都笑了。（附图片）
