    Credit Cooperatives Raising Funds
    Staff members of the Panzhong People's Commune Credit Cooperative and bank branch in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, are actively raising production funds.

    In order to allocate spring plowing production funds in a planned manner, they first calculated three accounts: income, expenditure, and savings. Under the leadership of the commune party committee, they conducted a publicity and education campaign on deposits and savings for all commune members, enabling the masses to understand the relationship between expanding reproduction and improving living standards. As a result, 98% of households in the commune have participated in savings from December of last year to the present.

    To facilitate the smooth development of credit business, credit sub-branches were established in each management area, and savings service stations were set up in production teams. The credit cooperative plans to issue 50,000 yuan in loans this spring to support the commune in purchasing agricultural tools and machinery in order to improve spring plowing production.

    信用部筹集资金
    江西永新县泮中公社信用合作部和银行营业所的工作人员，正积极筹集生产资金。
    他们为了有计划地投放春耕生产资金，首先算好了收入、支出、储蓄等三笔账。又在公社党委的领导下，向全社社员进行了一次存款、储蓄的宣传教育活动，使群众懂得扩大再生产和改善生活的关系，积极地参加储蓄，从去年12月到目前为止，全社98％的户都参加了储蓄。
    为了使信用业务更顺利地开展，在各管理区成立了信用分部，生产队设立了储蓄服务站。信用部计划规定在今春要发放五万元贷款，支援公社购买农具和药械，以便搞好春耕生产。
