Schools Adopt Diverse Teaching Methods Based on Children's Characteristics
Tianjin Elementary School Students Develop Morally, Intellectually, and Physically in an All-Round Way

    (Our report) Tianjin's more than 600 elementary schools, based on the principle of education first and the characteristics of children, have adopted various forms of moral, intellectual, and physical education, fundamentally changing the face of elementary education.

    In implementing the Party's education policy last year, Tianjin's elementary schools successively established more than 1,000 small factories and small farms. Under the guidance of teachers, workers, and farmers, children participated in various kinds of labor within their capabilities. Through these productive practices, the children gradually developed a love for labor and a love for the collective, and learned many production skills. Last year, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also commended and rewarded 2,000 outstanding Young Pioneers.

    Since the beginning of this semester, schools have formally included labor in their teaching plans based on the age, physical strength, knowledge level, and interests of elementary school students. They have adjusted the schools' labor bases and rationally arranged labor time. For example, Chongde Li Elementary School has partnered with nearby factories, eliminating some factories that were not suitable for elementary school students and adjusting from the original twenty-plus factories to seven small processing plants for brush making, weaving, and toys. Senior students work three times a week for about six hours, middle-grade students work about four hours a week, and younger students are organized to do labor games or cleaning activities within their capabilities. Jinzhong Bridge Elementary School also pays attention to cultivating students' labor concepts in production labor. When the students of the sixth grade, second class, began to work in the spinning workshop to wind bobbins, they thought the work was simple and did it carelessly. They didn't fix the broken ends before continuing to wind, and the wound bobbins were often not up to standard. In response to these situations, the school invited veteran workers to explain the entire weaving process to the students. The students quickly became able to consciously abide by the operating procedures, and the product quality continued to improve.

    Under the guidance of the Party's education policy, schools have further arranged teaching while comprehensively arranging various tasks. In addition to the principal frequently attending classes, regularly going to factories and villages, connecting with actual production, and actively improving teaching, workers and farmers with practical production experience are also invited to give lectures. The language teacher of Ditou Qianjie Elementary School invited an old worker from the Sixth Tool Factory to give a lecture on "The Red Flag of Communist Ideology" to the fifth-grade students. The students gained a lot after listening. Sixth-grade students at Chongde Li Elementary School used to find some nouns and concepts in natural science and geography difficult to understand, and they were not very interested in learning. In the fifth grade, about half of the students failed the exam. In response to this situation, the teachers used the school's teaching aid factory to organize students to make mountains, rivers, etc., when lecturing and assigning homework, and used holidays to lead students to the field to collect specimens related to rocks, etc. This stimulated students' interest in these subjects and deepened their impression of the knowledge they learned. In the geography exam last semester, twenty-six of the thirty-five students in the sixth grade, second class, scored five, and nine scored four.

    Elementary schools have also actively taken measures to strengthen students' political and ideological education. At present, the vast majority of elementary schools have established political common sense courses in the senior grades and revolutionary story courses in the middle and lower grades. Before giving students a political common sense class on "The Superiority of the Socialist System," Changde Road Elementary School first led the children to visit an exhibition of "Comparison of Life Before and After Liberation" at a brother school, and then told the children about the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland. Finally, they led the children to visit the Tianjin Bicycle Factory, so that everyone could see the workers' selfless enthusiasm for labor and inspire everyone to love the new society more deeply. Many schools also organize students to read newspapers collectively, open communist education corridors, hold photo exhibitions, organize them to visit and hold forums with workers, farmers, and Liberation Army uncles, and other diverse forms to conduct socialist and communist education for the children. As a result of in-depth and meticulous political and ideological education, students' political awareness has been significantly improved. For example, Jinwei Bridge Elementary School saw 843 good deeds and good people who loved the motherland, loved the collective, and loved learning in six weeks. Students at Huangwei Road Elementary School have developed the habit of reading newspapers. All 1,100 students in the senior and middle grades of the school have subscribed to 990 copies of "China Young Pioneers News" and "New Young Pioneers News".

    In order to enrich and enliven the lives of children, schools also frequently hold science evenings, poetry recitations, music appreciation meetings, and movie screenings. They organize art groups, dance groups, and small bands to help children establish cultural and recreational activity bases, establish "Cultural and Recreational Corners for Squadrons," organize "Homes for Platoons," and tutor students in the two-part system to establish various family interest groups, making children's lives rich, colorful, and full of fun.

　　学校根据儿童特点采取多种多样形式教学
　　天津小学生德育智育体育全面发展
    本报讯　天津市六百多所小学校，根据以教育为主和少年儿童的特点，采取多种形式，进行德育、智育、体育的教育，使小学教育的面貌发生了根本的变化。
    天津各小学，去年在贯彻党的教育方针中，先后建立了一千多个小工厂、小农场。少年儿童在教师、工人和农民的指导下，参加了力所能及的各种劳动。通过这些生产实践，使孩子们逐步养成了热爱劳动、热爱集体的思想感情，并学会了许多生产技能；去年共青团天津市委，还表扬和奖励了二千名优秀的少先队员。
    这学期开学以来，各学校根据小学生的年龄、体力、知识水平和爱好，把劳动正式列入教学计划，调整了学校的劳动基地，合理安排了劳动时间。如崇德里小学和附近的一些工厂挂钩，取消了一些不适合小学生进行劳动的工厂，由原来的二十多个工厂调整成制刷、编织、玩具等七个小加工厂。高年级学生每周劳动三次，约六小时，中年级学生每周劳动四小时左右，低年级学生年龄小，每周组织做一些劳动游戏或力所能及的清洁卫生活动。金钟桥小学，在生产劳动中，还注意培养学生的劳动观念。该校六年级二班学生们，开始到纺纱车间作缠线轴工作时，认为工作简单，做起活来马虎了草。断头后不接好就继续缠，缠的线轴常常不合规格。针对这些情况，学校请老工人给学生们讲解整个织布的操作过程，学生们很快就能够自觉地遵守操作规程，产品质量不断地提高。
    在党的教育方针的指导下，各学校全面安排各项工作时，也进一步安排了教学。除校长经常下课堂听课，定期下厂下乡，联系生产实际，积极改进教学外，还请有实际生产经验的工人、农民讲课。堤头前街小学的语文教师邀请第六工具厂的一位老工人给五年级学生讲“共产主义思想的红旗”一课，学生们听完后，收获很大。崇德里小学的六年级学生过去学习自然、地理课时，感到有些名词、概念难懂，学习时兴趣不大，在五年级时有半数左右的学生考试不及格。针对这种情况，教师在讲课和布置作业时利用学校的教具工厂，组织学生制做山脉、河流等，并利用假日带领学生到野外采集岩石等有关部分的标本。激发了学生对这些学科的兴趣，加深了所学知识的印象。六年级二班三十五名学生，上学期考试地理课，有二十六人得五分，九人得四分。
    各小学校还积极采取措施，加强对学生的政治思想教育。目前，绝大多数小学校已在高年级设立了政治常识课，在中、低年级设立了革命故事课。常德道小学在给学生们讲“社会主义制度优越性”的政治常识课之前，先领孩子们参观了兄弟学校的一个“解放前后生活对比”的展览会，然后把祖国大跃进的情形，讲给孩子们听，最后又领孩子们去天津自行车厂参观，让大家亲眼看看工人叔叔们忘我劳动的热情，激发大家更深刻地热爱新社会。许多学校还组织学生们集体读报，开辟共产主义教育走廊，举办图片展览，组织他们参观访问，同工人、农民、解放军叔叔们举行座谈等多种多样的形式，对孩子们进行社会主义与共产主义教育。由于深入细致进行政治思想教育的结果，学生们的政治觉悟有了显著提高。如锦衣卫桥小学，在六个星期里就涌现出爱祖国、爱集体、爱学习的好人好事八百四十三件。黄伟路小学的学生，已养成了阅读报纸的习惯，全校高、中年级一千一百多名学生共订了九百九十份“中国少年报”和“新少年报”。
    为了丰富活跃少年儿童的生活，各学校还经常举办科学晚会、诗歌朗诵会、音乐欣赏会、看电影，组织美术小组、舞蹈小组、小小乐队等，帮助少年儿童建立文娱活动阵地，成立“中队文娱角”，组织“小队之家”，辅导二部制的学生成立各种各样的家庭兴趣小组，使孩子们的生活丰富多采，充满乐趣。（洪敏生）
