Everyone's Heart is Set on a Bumper Harvest; Farming is Like Embroidering a Carpet
Ningxia Hui and Han Peasants Unite to Energetically Engage in Spring Plowing

This dispatch reports that the two million Hui and Han peasants of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, united as one, are comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production, making spring plowing and sowing both fast and good, laying a good foundation for a greater agricultural harvest this year.

In last year's Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the Hui and Han peasants of the Ningxia region united and helped each other, working together and achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. Grain output increased by 76% compared to 1957, and the average grain per person increased from more than 600 jin in 1957 to more than 1,100 jin. This year, the Hui and Han peasants are advancing on their victories with even greater ambitions. They have loudly proclaimed: The Hui and Han are of one heart, everyone's heart is set on a bumper harvest, our energy will break through the sky, a great battle in this crucial year. At present, spring sowing in the Yellow River irrigation area of the Yinchuan Plain has been successfully completed ten days earlier than last year. Spring sowing in the southern mountainous areas has also been successfully completed.

This year's deep plowing and intensive cultivation is better than in previous years. More than 85% of the region's 2.5 million mu of wheat fields have been deep-plowed to about one foot, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased by more than double that of last year. High-yield fields generally receive 50,000 to 60,000 jin of base fertilizer, and some even reach more than 100,000 jin. Forty thousand mu of wheat fields have implemented layered fertilization in conjunction with deep plowing; seeds have generally undergone careful selection and treatment, and close planting in rows has been universally implemented, greatly reducing row spacing. In preparing the land to conserve moisture, multiple tillage methods combining raking, harrowing, and rolling have been adopted. Generally, the land is shallowly plowed once, raked once, and harrowed once before sowing; and then raked once and harrowed once after sowing. The technical specifications for deep plowing, fertilization, land preparation, and sowing have been particularly well implemented on more than one million mu of high-yield fields. Each wheat field is square and orderly, the ditches and dikes are in a straight line, and the ground is as flat as a mirror.

This year, the region plans to produce 1.7 billion jin of native fertilizer, several times more than last year. Progress has also been made in tool reform this year. All localities are actively improving tools in accordance with the principles of adapting to local conditions and combining indigenous and modern methods. Many communes have basically achieved a situation where communes have repair and assembly plants, brigades have repair and assembly stations, and production teams have repair and assembly groups. In terms of water conservancy, this year's plan is to expand the irrigated area by more than one million mu, which is more than five times that of 1957. The scale of irrigation area is also larger than last year. The Yellow River Plain irrigation area has already mobilized thousands of troops and horses to start the spring repair of canals. The drainage and irrigation systems are being fully renovated, canals and drainage ditches are being added, and engineering equipment for regulating water volume is being increased. In addition, the ten large reservoirs being built in the southern mountainous areas can completely fulfill the task of expanding the irrigated area and ensure that the existing 4 million mu of irrigated land has sufficient water.

In order to combine soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis and better implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production, an agricultural scientific research network is being formed throughout the region. More than 800 scientific research institutions of various types have been established in the region. The Autonomous Region Plant Protection Station has also begun to study ways to eliminate 13 kinds of pests and diseases, such as underground insects and wheat sucking bugs, and strive to eliminate four kinds of insect pests this year, including wheat sucking bugs, sesame oil leakage bugs, and sugar beet weevils.

During the spring sowing period, the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation between regions and among members of all ethnic groups has been further developed, and everywhere is filled with the revolutionary enthusiasm and joyful scenes of members of all ethnic groups uniting and helping each other and engaging in production. Some regions, after discovering that some communes and teams lacked good seeds during inspections, immediately organized cooperation, exchanged seeds with each other, and supplied good seeds to the communes and teams that lacked them. Some regions with small populations, large amounts of land, and scarce labor, and poor fertilizer, immediately provided assistance to regions with more labor and fertilizer during spring plowing; regions with later sowing seasons mobilized labor and agricultural tools to support regions with earlier spring sowing. In order to better improve labor efficiency, the production teams of the communes jointly formed by the Hui and Han nationalities used each nationality's team member's strengths to arrange work for each person to the best of their ability. Specialized production teams were set up for accumulating fertilizer, delivering manure, preparing land, selecting and mixing seeds, improving tools, and sowing. Methods were adopted such as key breakthroughs, centralized large tasks, and decentralized small tasks to solve the problem of insufficient labor and improve work efficiency. During spring plowing, a large number of Hui and Han cadres from various counties also united, took the lead, and went deep into the grassroots, appearing as ordinary laborers to lead production. Thanks to the concerted efforts and high enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and members of all ethnic groups, although they encountered two cold waves and two snowfalls during the sowing period, they still overcame various difficulties without affecting the progress and quality of spring sowing. In carrying out the revolutionary competition for large-scale high-yield production, the spirit of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, learning from each other's strengths, and leaping forward together by the commune members was particularly prominent. After the Honghua Commune, jointly formed by Hui and Han peasants in Yinchuan City, proposed to launch an agricultural production increase competition throughout the region, it was immediately warmly responded to by the people's communes throughout the region. Communes and communes, production teams and production teams of the communes, also issued challenges and reply forms to each other, and repeatedly revised measures to launch competitions, pushing the agricultural production increase campaign to a new climax.

After achieving victory in spring sowing, the farmers of all ethnic groups are now continuing to advance on their victories, proposing to break through the "five barriers": wheat field management, accumulating and applying topdressing fertilizer, deep plowing autumn crop land, field management work, and sowing economic crops to ensure a comprehensive and bumper agricultural harvest.

　　人人心向大丰收　种田如像绣花毯
　　宁夏回汉农民齐心大闹春耕
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区二百万回汉农民，拧成一股劲，全面贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”，把春耕播种做得又快又好，为今年农业更大丰收奠定良好基础。
    在去年的农业大跃进中，宁夏地区回汉农民团结互助，齐心协力，获得了史无前例的大丰收。粮食产量比1957年增长76％，每人平均粮食由1957年的六百多斤增加到一千一百多斤。今年，回汉农民乘胜前进，雄心更大。他们响亮地提出：回汉团结一条心，人人心向大丰收，干劲冲破天，大战关键年。目前，银川平原黄河灌溉区的春播已经比去年提前十天胜利完成。南部山区的春播也已胜利完成。
    今年深耕细作的情况，比往年都好。全区二百五十万亩麦田中，85％以上深翻了一尺左右，施肥量比去年增加一倍以上。高额丰产田一般都施基肥五、六万斤，有的达十万多斤。有四万亩麦田结合深翻实行了分层施肥；籽种普遍经过精选和处理，并普遍实行条播密植，大大缩小了行距。整地保墒，采取了耙、?、磙相结合的多次整地方法，一般土地都在播种前浅犁一遍，耙一遍，?一遍；播种后再耙一遍，?一遍。一百多万亩高额丰产田，深耕施肥、整地、播种的技术规格贯彻得格外好，块块麦田，成方似阵，沟坝一条线，地平如镜面。
    今年全区计划生产土化肥十七亿斤，超过去年好几倍。在工具改革方面，今年也作得较好。各地都按因地制宜，土洋结合的原则，积极改进工具。不少公社还基本上达到社有修配厂，大队有修配站，生产队有修配组。在水利方面，今年计划扩大灌溉面积一百多万亩，等于1957年的五倍多。灌溉面积规模之大，也超过去年。黄河平原灌溉区目前已经出动千军万马，开始渠道春修工程。全面整修排灌系统，增修渠道和排水沟，增加调剂水量的工程设备。加上南部山区正在兴修的十座大水库，完全可以完成扩大灌溉面积任务，并保证现有四百多万亩水地有充足的用水。
    为了使冲天干劲和科学分析相结合，更好地贯彻农业生产的“八字宪法”，全区的农业科学研究网也正在形成。全区已经建立的各种科学研究机构有八百多处。自治区植物保护站也开始研究地下虫和吸浆虫等十三种病虫害的消灭办法，争取在今年内消灭小麦吸浆虫、胡麻漏油虫、甜菜象鼻虫等四种虫害。
    春播期间，各地区和各族社员之间的互助协作精神得到进一步的发扬，到处充满各族社员团结互助，大搞生产的革命干劲和欢乐景象。有些地区在检查中发现有的社队缺良种以后，立即组织了协作，互相调换，给缺少良种的社队供应了良种。有些地区人口少，土地多，劳力少，肥料差，春耕中劳力多，肥料多的地区，也立即给以帮助；播种季节较迟的地区，调动劳力，农具，支援了春播较早的地区。为了更好地提高劳动效率，回汉联合组成的公社各生产队都根据各族社员的特长，因人使用，人尽其材，分别组成积肥、送粪、整地、选种拌种、改良工具和播种等各种专业生产队，采取重点突击，大活集中，小活分散等办法，解决了劳力不足的问题，提高了工效。春耕中，各县的大批回、汉族干部，也团结一致，身先士卒，深入基层，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，领导生产。由于各族广大干部和社员齐心协力，干劲高涨，播种期间，虽然遇到了两次寒流，并降了两次雪，仍然克服了各种困难，没有影响春播的进展和质量。在开展大面积高额丰产革命竞赛中，各公社社员的学先进、赶先进、取长补短齐跃进的精神，表现得特别突出。银川市回汉农民联合组成的红花公社，向全区提出开展农业增产竞赛的倡议后，立即得到全区人民公社的热烈响应。公社与公社之间，公社的生产队与生产队之间，也互相下挑战书，递应战表，一再修订措施，开展竞赛。把农业增产运动推上了一个新的高潮。
    各族农民在春播取得胜利后，现在正继续乘胜前进，提出再破“五关”：小麦田间管理关、积造追肥关、深翻秋作物地关、田园化工作关、经济作物播种关，确保农业全面大丰收。（王得温）
