Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 10th: Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, delivered a report at the plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee on the 8th. The full text is as follows:

Deputy Chairman Zhang, Deputy Chairman Apai, esteemed members, friends, and comrades:

Due to the majority of Kalons in the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique colluding with imperialism and various counter-revolutionary elements, abducting the Dalai Lama, tearing up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and engaging in the heinous activities of betraying the motherland, betraying the Tibetan people, and selling out national interests, the State Council issued an order on March 28th to dissolve the Tibetan local government and entrusted the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region with the functions and powers of the local government, and ordered the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region to thoroughly quell the rebellion in the Tibetan region and maintain social order. All these measures are entirely in line with the wishes and interests of all monks and laypeople in Tibet, conducive to the progress and development of various construction undertakings in the Tibetan region, and entirely correct. We warmly support this order and are determined to complete the various tasks put forward in the order.

Since the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Dalai Lama, has been abducted by rebellious elements, the State Council has decided that during the Dalai Lama's abduction, I shall act as Chairman. This is the trust of the country and the people in me, giving me great honor, and also giving me a great responsibility. I am determined, under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, under the direct leadership and assistance of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, and with the support of all members and staff of the Preparatory Committee and all monks and laypeople in Tibet, to conscientiously complete the glorious and important tasks assigned to me by the country and the people, and to repay the trust of the country and the people in me. At the same time, I personally feel sympathy and concern for the Dalai Lama's situation of being abducted by rebellious elements and for his safety.

From the day the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion launched by the reactionary forces in Lhasa was completely quelled, the situation in Tibet has been undergoing tremendous changes in all aspects. We can affirm that this change will further consolidate the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities, and enable the Tibetan people to embark on the road to a prosperous and happy socialist life at an early date. Under this new situation, in accordance with the matters stipulated in the order of the State Council, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region must hold a plenary meeting to discuss and resolve the future tasks and related issues, so as to better shoulder its responsibilities. Now I solemnly announce that the first plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region to exercise the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government is open.

First of all, we all know very well that although the armed rebellion launched by the rebellious elements in Lhasa has been completely crushed, there are still a certain number of armed rebellious elements in Tibet. They are still burning, killing, looting, raping women, persecuting patriotic and progressive people, and engaging in heinous activities of harming the people and betraying the motherland. The State Council has clearly ordered the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion. To fully support and assist the People's Liberation Army in carrying out the work of quelling the rebellion is a major task for our Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and all the people of Tibet at present. We must go all out to earnestly complete this glorious task, so as to quickly restore peace and order and enable the Tibetan people to engage in production with peace of mind. To this end, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the various Jiqiao-level offices must lead and organize all monks and laypeople to do a good job in supporting the work. They should provide information to the quelling troops, transport supplies, and organize condolences, etc., to ensure that the People's Liberation Army successfully completes the task of quelling the rebellion.

By order of the State Council, the Preparatory Committee is to exercise the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government, and is to fully support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion. Therefore, it is necessary to establish some new institutions and increase the number of cadres on the existing basis, according to the needs of the current work, in order to improve and strengthen the organizational structure of the Preparatory Committee. When we select and use cadres, we should base it on two criteria: being patriotic and progressive politically; and being able to competently undertake the work assigned to them and actively and conscientiously complete the tasks. Only in this way can we ensure that the various tasks of our Preparatory Committee are done well.

At the same time, we must further strengthen and consolidate the unity among all nationalities and within Tibet. In the future, we must break down the old boundaries and old concepts, eliminate those factors that are not conducive to unity, and unite on a new basis. This basis is patriotism, progress, and taking the socialist road. That is to say, we must unite under the leadership of the Communist Party, learn together, and make progress together.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, the People's Liberation Army and the working personnel entering Tibet have always implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, but a small number of religious scum, wearing religious cloaks, participated in the rebellion, especially in the armed rebellion launched by the reactionary elements in Lhasa this time. Many counter-revolutionary elements in the religious circles attacked the People's Liberation Army together with the rebellious elements. In order to thoroughly quell the rebellion, the People's Liberation Army was forced to engage in combat with the rebellious elements. Even during the quelling of the rebellion, the People's Liberation Army and the working personnel entering Tibet resolutely protected the patriotic and law-abiding temples and religious figures. All monks who are patriotic and law-abiding, abide by their duties, and recite scriptures properly can be protected by the government.

In short, this meeting of ours is a meeting of far-reaching significance. At this meeting, we must fully discuss and decide on many important issues. I fully believe that we will be able to unite as one, hold this meeting well, and create a good start for our future work. This meeting is also the beginning of a new historical period in Tibet. Here, I would like to extend warm congratulations to all members, friends, and comrades. Extend warm congratulations and cordial greetings to all the people of Tibet; extend warm congratulations to the patriotic and progressive people among the officials of the original Tibetan local government, headed by Deputy Chairman Apai, and congratulate them on their victory in their resolute struggle against the reactionary elements of the original Tibetan local government. Pay the highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and the great leader Chairman Mao. Pay tribute to the heroic People's Liberation Army. Extend deep condolences to the relatives of the patriotic and progressive person Kanqiong Soinam Jiatso, who was killed by the rebellious elements, and to Comrade Sangpo Tseten Rinchen, a member who was wounded by the rebellious elements. Finally, I propose that everyone stand up and pay tribute to the martyrs of the People's Liberation Army and the patriotic and progressive person Kanqiong Soinam Jiatso who bravely dedicated their precious lives in this battle to quell the rebellion.

　　西藏新的历史时期的开端
　　班禅额尔德尼在西藏自治区筹委会全体会议上的报告
    新华社拉萨10日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼8日在筹委会全体委员会议上的报告，全文如下：张副主任委员、阿沛副主任委员、各位委员、朋友们、同志们：
    由于西藏地方政府多数噶伦与上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和各种反革命分子，劫持达赖喇嘛，撕毁了和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，进行了背叛祖国、背叛西藏人民、出卖民族利益的罪恶活动，国务院于3月28日发布命令，解散了西藏地方政府，责成西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府的职权，并责令人民解放军西藏军区彻底平息西藏地区的叛乱，维护社会秩序。这一切措施，是完全符合西藏全体僧俗人民的愿望和利益的，是有利于西藏地区各方面建设事业的进步和发展的，是完全正确的。我们热烈拥护这一命令，并要坚决完成命令中提出的各项任务。
    由于西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员达赖喇嘛被叛国分子劫持而去，国务院决定在达赖喇嘛被劫持期间，由我代理主任委员的工作。这是国家和人民对我的信任，给我的极大的光荣，同时也给了我重大的责任。我决心在中国共产党中央、中央人民政府的英明领导下，在中共西藏工委的直接领导和帮助下，在筹委会全体委员、全体工作人员以及西藏全体僧俗人民的支持下，兢兢业业地去完成国家和人民交给我的光荣而重大的任务，回答国家和人民对我的信任。同时，对达赖喇嘛被叛国分子劫持的处境及他的安全，我个人深感同情和悬念。
    从反动势力在拉萨发动的反革命武装叛乱被彻底平息的那一天起，西藏各方面的情况正在起着巨大的变化。我们可以肯定，这一变化将更加巩固祖国的统一和民族的团结，使西藏人民早日走向繁荣幸福的社会主义大路，在此新的情况下，遵照国务院命令中规定的事项，西藏自治区筹备委员会必须举行一次全体会议，商讨并解决今后的任务以及与此有关的问题，以便更好地担负起自己的任务。现在我郑重地宣布，西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权的第一次全体委员会议开幕了。
    首先，我们大家都清楚地知道，叛乱分子在拉萨市所发动的武装叛乱虽然已经完全被粉碎了，但是在西藏还有一定数量的武装叛乱分子，他们仍在烧杀抢劫，奸淫妇女，迫害爱国进步人士，进行着残害人民，背叛祖国的罪恶活动。国务院已明令人民解放军彻底平息叛乱。全力支援和协助人民解放军进行平叛工作，就是目前我们西藏自治区筹备委员会和全体西藏人民的一项主要任务。我们必须全力以赴，认真地完成此一光荣任务，以便迅速恢复和平秩序，使西藏人民安心从事生产。为此，西藏自治区筹备委员会及各基巧级办事处必须领导和组织全体僧俗人民，做好支援工作。应该对平叛部队介绍情况，运输补给和组织慰问等，保证人民解放军胜利地完成平叛任务。
    奉国务院的命令，筹委会要行使西藏地方政府的职权，并要全力支援人民解放军平息叛乱，因而有必要在现有的基础上，根据目前工作的需要，增设一些机构，增加一些干部，健全和充实筹委会的组织机构。我们选拔使用干部时，应该根据两条标准：在政治上爱国进步；能胜任地担负起分配他的工作，并能积极认真地去完成任务。只有这样，才能保证把我们筹委会的各项工作做好。
    同时，我们必须进一步加强和巩固各民族间和西藏内部的团结，今后我们必须打破旧有界线和旧的观念，消除那些不利于团结的因素，在新的基础上团结起来。这个基础就是爱国进步和走社会主义道路。也就是说我们必须团结在共产党的领导下，共同学习，共同进步。
    在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，人民解放军和进藏工作人员向来都是贯彻执行宗教信仰自由政策的，但是少数宗教界的败类，披着宗教外衣参加叛乱，特别这次在拉萨反动分子所发动的武装叛乱中，有不少宗教界的反革命分子与叛乱分子一起，向人民解放军发起全面进攻，人民解放军为了彻底平息叛乱，被迫与叛乱分子展开战斗。就是在平叛期间人民解放军和进藏工作人员也是坚决保护爱国守法的寺庙和宗教界人士的。所有僧众只要爱国守法，安分守己，好好念经，都可以受到政府保护的。
    总之，我们这次的会议是一次具有深远意义的会议，在这次会议上我们要充分地讨论并决定许多重大问题。我完全相信我们一定能够团结一致，开好这次会议，为我们今后的工作创造一个良好的开端。这次会议也是西藏新的历史时期的开端。在此我谨向各位委员、朋友们、同志们致热烈的祝贺。向西藏全体人民致热烈的祝贺和亲切的慰问；向以阿沛副主任委员为首的原西藏地方政府官员中的爱国进步人士致以热烈的祝贺，祝贺他们同原西藏地方政府的反动分子进行了坚决斗争而取得了胜利。向中国共产党、中央人民政府和伟大领袖毛主席致崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。向英勇的人民解放军致敬。向被叛国分子杀害了的爱国进步人士堪穷索朗降措的亲属，以及被叛国分子打伤的桑颇·才旺仁增委员致深切的慰问。最后我并提议大家起立，向在此次平叛战斗中英勇献出自己宝贵生命的人民解放军烈士和死难的爱国进步人士堪穷索朗降措致哀。
