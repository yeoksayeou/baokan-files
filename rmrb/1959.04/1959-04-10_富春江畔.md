On the banks of the Fuchun River
Mao Naiguang

The beautiful Fuchun River flows quietly...

Spring is warm and flowers bloom. Climbing the Diaotai (Fishing Terrace) on the bank of the Fuchun River and looking down, the turquoise water is like a mirror. The mountain looks like a camel's hump, covered with green moss, like a green carpet. The fields are full of flowers, verdant and lush, and the scenery is extremely charming.

About three kilometers downstream from the Diaotai is the exit of the Qililong Gorge. Right here, a large hydropower station is under construction. It is currently in a tense construction phase. The first phase of bamboo and wooden cage cofferdams has encircled half of the riverbed. Within the cofferdam, thousands of workers are fighting the earth day and night. The motors roar all night long, the sound of pumping water, the sounds of pneumatic drills rising and falling one after another, and the sound of pile drivers, awaken this sleeping valley. When night falls, the stars and the moon are in the sky, and the construction site is dotted with lights. It is hard to tell which are the stars and which are the lights.

In the morning, after a loud explosion from the opening mountain cannon, the youth shock teams rush to work where the dust rises. The swift-footed young porters are racing with "Liberation" brand transport vehicles, and the excavators who can pull mountains are waving their giant arms to compete with the excavators. "Resolutely run ahead of the flood, complete the excavation ahead of schedule, welcome the large-scale concrete pouring, and ensure power generation by 'June 1st' next year." This is the bold statement of the people of Fuchun River.

People are fighting hard and cleverly. If there is no cement, they burn it themselves; if there is no steel, they smelt it themselves. In order to solve the shortage of concrete mixers, veteran workers and technicians worked closely together and finally trial-produced a batch of wooden concrete mixers, solving the concrete construction task facing them in April.

This project started last year and will generate electricity in the first half of next year. Such a large project would normally take four or five years to complete, but now the time has been compressed by almost half. This is a riverbed hydropower station. The power plant building, which blocks water, is on the left bank, the spillway dam is in the middle, and there is a ship lock on the right side for navigation. There are also two "fish ladders" specially designed for fish breeding and passage. The Fuchun River Chinese herring is a well-known specialty in the country, and the Chinese herring near Diaotai is particularly valuable. It is said that this fish has a characteristic: it goes upstream to the Diaotai to spawn in winter, and the fry go downstream to forage during the spring flood season. With the "fish ladder", fish can pass unimpeded, ensuring a bumper harvest of Chinese herring.

Fuchun River, you have ushered in true prosperity and spring!

    富春江畔
    毛乃光
    美丽的富春江静静地流着……
    春暖花开，登上富春江岸的钓台，俯瞰台前，碧流如镜，山势宛如驼峰，山上绿茸茸的，好像铺上一片绿色毯子，四野繁花似锦，苍翠蓊郁，景色迷人极了。
    在钓台下游约三公里，是七里泷峡谷的出口处，就在这里，正在兴建一座大水电站。现在正是施工紧张阶段，第一期竹木笼围堰把河床拦腰围住一半，围堰内成千名工人不分昼夜地在跟大地搏斗。彻夜轰鸣的马达声，抽水声，此起彼落的风钻机声，打桩机声，震醒了这沉睡的山谷。每当夜幕降临，当空星光明月，工地上灯光棋布，到底哪是星星，哪是灯光，也分辨不清了。
    早晨，一阵开山炮的巨响以后，尘烟起处，青年突击手们就奔忙开了，健步如飞的青年抬运工在与“解放牌”装运车竞赛，力能拔山的开挖工齐挥巨臂与挖土机比高低。“坚决跑在洪水前面，提前完成开挖，迎接混凝土大浇捣，确保明年‘六一’发电”。这就是富春江人的豪言壮语。
    人们苦干加巧干地战斗着。没有水泥自己烧，没有钢材自己炼。为了解决混凝土拌和机不足，老工人与技术人员密切协作，终于试制成一批木质混凝土拌和机，解决了4月份面临的混凝土施工任务。
    这个工程去年开工，到明年上半年要发电，这样大的工程，在往常，总要四、五年才能建成，而现在，在时间上几乎压缩了一半。这是一个河床式水电站，靠左岸一段是挡水的发电厂房，中间是滚水坝，右边还有一道船闸，以便航运，还有两道“鱼梯”，专为鱼类繁殖与通行而设的。富春江鲥鱼是全国驰名的特产，钓台附近的鲥鱼尤为名贵。据说这种鱼有个特性，冬季要到钓台上游去产卵，待春汛期，鱼苗再到下游觅食。有了“鱼梯”，鱼类就可通行无阻，保证了鲥鱼的丰产丰收。
    富春江呵，你迎来了真正的富饶和春光！
