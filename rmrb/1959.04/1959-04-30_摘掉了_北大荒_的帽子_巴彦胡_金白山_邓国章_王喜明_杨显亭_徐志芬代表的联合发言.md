Chairman, fellow representatives:

We wholeheartedly support the various reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen at the conference, and express our determination to strive to fulfill the various tasks proposed in the reports in our work in 1959.

In the past, people always called Heilongjiang the "Great Northern Wilderness." Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the support of the people of the whole country, after long-term construction, especially in the extraordinary great leap forward of 1958, all undertakings have developed rapidly. In addition, with the realization of communization, the label of "Great Northern Wilderness" has now been removed. This title can only be used as a historical record and will never return. Below, we will only talk about the leap forward in grain production in the areas where we work in 1958.

The issue of increasing grain production is the issue that the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country are most concerned about. Grain production has increased greatly in recent years, but it has never increased as much as in 1958.

Looking at our areas:

Unit:			1957 Total Grain Output	1958 Total Grain Output	Increase Over Previous Year
Zhaoyuan County	Around 140 million jin	Around 500 million jin	257%
Suihua County Qiyi Management Area	1.34 million jin		2.973 million jin		121%
Keshan County Shuguang Management Area	1.866 million jin		3.918 million jin		109%
Boli County Baoken Management Area	1.06 million jin		2.14 million jin		100%
Jiamusi City Xinghuo Management Area	2.02 million jin		4.02 million jin		100%

Such a great harvest in grain production in 1958 has never happened before. This is the fruitful result of the Great Leap Forward and the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction. Judging from the situation and conditions at the time, completing this task was not smooth sailing. It was precisely achieved after overcoming many struggles in thought, material, and natural disasters.

First of all, in our area, because the land area burdened by the labor force is large, each labor force bears an average of about 50 to 70 mu of land. According to the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the workload in terms of water conservancy projects, fertilizer application, deep plowing of land, tool reform, etc., has increased several times compared with the previous year. In addition, large-scale perennial water conservancy projects, diversified operations, large-scale steel production, and large-scale industry also occupied a large amount of labor, which correspondingly reduced the labor force directly participating in agricultural production at that time. Especially Zhaoyuan County suffered a serious flood in 1957; houses were destroyed, farmland was flooded, agricultural tools were damaged, and there was a shortage of food and grass. It had to repair houses, build bridges and roads, drain floodwater, transport grain and grass; at the same time, it had to send manure, turn the land, reform tools, and build water conservancy projects. The task of struggle at that time was extremely arduous. It was necessary to fight against difficulties and disasters, and also to fight against right-leaning conservative ideas; it was necessary to produce for self-relief and to achieve the target of 400 jin per mu proposed in the agricultural development program in the same year. Judging from the situation at the time, the large amount of various tasks put a lot of pressure on cadres and the masses. However, after the great rectification movement and the in-depth implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the broad masses of peasants unleashed enormous power in overcoming difficulties and conquering production tasks. Although under the threat of serious disasters, the broad masses of peasants marched forward with their heads held high and did not bow their heads and give up. Because in their hearts, there was a torrent of enthusiasm for building socialism that was more vigorous than burning flames, just like when they were escaping from the flood at that time, the peasants would rather abandon their property and first hold Chairman Mao's portrait in their arms. They said: "With our Party and our Chairman Mao, we are not afraid of anything." Therefore, the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward, which coincided with the wishes of the broad masses of people, were bound to produce its great power after being grasped by the masses. The peasants said: "After the flood in 1932, people suffered from hunger and cold, and families were broken up; after the flood in 1957, people lived a warm and full life, and people and property were both prosperous." This is full of the broad masses of peasants' love for the socialist system. Therefore, in the Great Leap Forward in 1958, no matter how many difficulties they encountered, they showed their soaring energy. For example, in the summer of 1958, there was no rain for 40 to 60 days, and the drought was very serious. When the seedlings turned yellow and did not grow, despite the large area of land and the small number of people, the lack of water sources, and the incomplete tools, the broad masses of commune members picked up all the tools that could be used and launched a large-scale water irrigation campaign. The broad masses of peasants said:

"Don't look at the old man in the sky making a big drought,
We have the Party's general line;
If it doesn't rain, people will irrigate it,
Quickly, well, and economically irrigate the land,
Let's have an ant moving a mountain 'art,'
All the people are of one mind to overcome the drought."

In this way, a tenacious drought resistance struggle was launched all over the mountains and plains, and finally the drought was overcome, and the growth and development of the seedlings were protected. Throughout the year, whether in the struggle against natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, and insects, or in completing various production increase measures, it was all solved by fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses for building socialism. We have consistently adhered to the principle of "if there are difficulties, organize the masses to 'debate,' if there is experience, organize the masses to 'see,' if there are pacesetters, mobilize the masses to 'compare,' and never stop 'doing' regardless of the size of the difficulties." In this way, we have always maintained the tenacious and vigorous fighting spirit of the broad masses of peasants. Because people's subjective initiative is the most active factor in the struggle for production. Of course, while fully mobilizing the subjective initiative of the broad masses and overcoming various difficulties, the agricultural production in 1958 basically grasped and implemented the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, improved and improved many farming methods and systems, and improved the agricultural production technology level of the broad masses, so that the labor army for increasing grain production has both courage and resourcefulness, both soaring energy and a certain degree of production increase technology. This was also a great progress in 1958, and it was also an important reason for the unprecedented bumper harvest last year.

Despite this, due to the emergence of the overall Great Leap Forward situation in 1958, coupled with the arduous task of increasing agricultural production, in the first half of the year, we were always "willing but not able" in terms of diversified operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The outstanding performance was that we were restricted by insufficient labor force and the seasonality of production, and the manpower could not be spared. Only after the realization of communization in September last year and the establishment of public canteens and nurseries, which liberated the broad masses of rural women from tedious housework, thereby replenishing and expanding the main force of the labor force, did this sharp contradiction gradually ease. Take the fishery production in Zhaoyuan County as an example: In the past, the annual output of freshwater fish in the county was only about 8 million jin. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it increased to 16 million jin (doubled). However, after the efforts of all commune members from last winter to this spring, the annual output of fish in 1959 may reach about 600 million jin, which will be more than 37 times higher than the Great Leap Forward output in 1958. Other aspects of diversified operation production will also have great development. The peasants said: "The mutual aid group is a mud bowl, the primary cooperative is a porcelain bowl, the advanced cooperative is an iron bowl, and the people's commune is a gold bowl." They described their hopes for the commune and said: "The commune has only been established for half a year, like a flower blooming halfway; if it takes a few more years, the power will be stronger than the sky."

Judging from these preliminary achievements alone, the people's commune has shown such great superiority. From the perspective of farmers' income, take the Qiyi Management Area of Suihua County as an example. In the total income in 1958 (excluding the income of about 200 yuan per household from household sideline occupations), after deducting state taxes, next year's production expenses, public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and management fees, the increase in the income of commune members compared with the previous year is as follows:

Year	Average Income per Household		Average Income per Person per Household
1957		348 yuan						62 yuan
1958		600 yuan						105 yuan
1959 (estimated)	Around 1300 yuan		Around 220 yuan

In the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the income level of farmers was significantly improved, and their lives were further improved. In this Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of farmers also received a profound exercise. The broad masses also deeply realized that following the Party's general line, fully carrying forward the enthusiasm of the broad masses for building socialism, and listening to the Party's words, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome.

Fellow representatives, just as our great motherland is in such a glorious and splendid era, and the people of the motherland are galloping on the broad road of building a peaceful and happy life, with brilliant achievements, a small handful of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, under the instigation and support of Indian expansionists, openly launched an armed rebellion, betrayed the motherland, and attempted to restore the aggressive forces of imperialism in Tibet, so that the Tibetan people would forever be reduced to a dark and hopeless hell on earth. This heinous treasonous crime aroused great indignation among the people of the whole country. This Tibetan reactionary traitorous group not only abducted the Dalai Lama into India, but also distributed a so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" by Indian diplomatic officials in Tezpur, India on April 18. We express our great anger at this. This so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" fully exposes the distortion of facts and the reversal of black and white. This is purely a fabrication jointly made by foreign aggressors and Tibetan rebels. We want to solemnly tell them that the people of our country will never allow any foreign reactionaries to interfere in China's internal affairs, and no foreigners are allowed to interfere in all major and minor matters within the Chinese people. The Chinese people, who have embarked on a happy and prosperous life, fully understand who is the enemy and who is the friend. What we want is sincere friendship, and we can fully see who is playing tricks there. We want to warn the imperialists and those who interfere in our internal affairs with sweet words and bitter hearts that any conspiracy of yours against the Chinese people is in vain. You must know that the Chinese people love peace, but we will never allow anyone to bully us. All those who wanted to bully us in the past suffered losses, and those of us who never wanted to bully others have flourished. Remember this historical lesson!

We were extremely excited to hear the tasks for 1959 proposed in the Premier's report, and we have a high degree of confidence in overfulfilling the glorious tasks that we should complete. In this first year of communization and to welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, we must, together with the broad masses of people, further implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Eight-Character Charter for agriculture, earnestly run the commune better, and we must strive with full confidence to win a more victorious battle in increasing grain production this year than last year.

    摘掉了“北大荒”的帽子
    巴彦胡　金白山　邓国章  王喜明　杨显亭　徐志芬代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们衷心拥护周总理，李富春、李先念副总理，彭真副委员长在大会上所作的各项报告，并表示决心在一九五九年的工作中，为实现报告中所提出的各项任务而努力奋斗。
    过去人们总把黑龙江称为“北大荒”，由于党的正确领导，全国人民的支持，经过长期建设，尤其在一九五八年这样一个不平凡的大跃进中，各项事业都有了突飞猛进的发展，再加上公社化的实现，现在“北大荒”的帽子已被摘掉了，这个称号只能作为历史记载，一去不复返了。下边仅从我们工作的地区谈谈一九五八年粮食生产的跃进情况。
    增产粮食的问题，是党中央，毛主席以及全国人民最关心的问题，几年来粮食产量均有很大提高，但是总没有像一九五八年这样增长的多。
    从我们这几个地方看：
    单位：  一九五七年粮食总产量  一九五八年粮食总产量  比上年增长
    肇源县　1.4亿左右　             5.0亿左右　           257％
    绥化县七一管理区　134万斤       297.3万斤　           121％
    克山县曙光管理区　186.6万斤　   391.8万斤　           109％
    勃力县抱垦管理区　106万斤　     214万斤　             100％
    强佳木斯市星火管理区　202万斤　 402万斤             　100％
    一九五八年粮食生产上取得这样大的收获，在过去是没有过的。这是大跃进的硕果，党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利。按当时的情况和条件来讲，完成这个任务并不是一帆风顺的，恰恰是经过战胜了许多思想上、物质上、与自然灾害的斗争所取得的。
    首先在我们那里因为劳动力负担的土地面积大，每个劳力平均负担的土地，一般均在五十至七十亩左右，按照一九五八年大跃进的要求，无论在水利工程，施肥数量，深翻土地，工具改革等等方面的工作量都比上年成倍的增加，加上大规模常年性的水利工程，多种经营，大搞钢铁，大办工业等方面也要占用大量的劳力，因而使当时直接参加农业生产的劳力相应的减少了。尤其像肇源县一九五七年全县遭受了严重的水灾；房屋冲毁，耕地积水，农具损坏，缺粮缺草的情况下，就不得不一面在修造房屋、建桥筑路，排水治洪，运粮运草；一面送粪、翻地，改革工具兴修水利等，当时的斗争任务是异常艰巨的。既要向困难和灾害作斗争，又要同右倾保守思想作斗争；既要生产自救，又要当年实现农业发展纲要提出的亩产四百斤指标。就当时的情况来讲，各种工作量之大，对干部，对群众都是有很大压力的。但是广大农民经过伟大的整风运动和深入的贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线以后，就在克服困难，战胜生产任务方面，发生了巨大的威力。虽然处在严重灾害的威胁之下，广大农民昂首阔步的前进，并未低下头来自甘暴弃。因为在他们的内心里有一股比燃烧的烈火还旺盛的建设社会主义的热流，就像当时在水灾脱险中，农民宁肯舍弃他们的财物，也要首先把毛主席的像抱在怀里，他们说：“有咱们党，有咱们的毛主席，我们什么也不怕”。所以说，吻合了广大人民心愿的党的社会主义建设总路线和大跃进，被群众掌握之后必然要产生出它的巨大威力。农民们说：“一九三二年的水灾后，人们饥寒交迫，家破人亡；一九五七年的水灾后，人们生活饱暖，人财两旺。”这里充满了广大农民对社会主义制度的热爱。所以在一九五八年的大跃进中，无论遇到多大的困难，他们都拿出了冲天的干劲。比如一九五八年夏季四十至六十多天没下雨旱灾十分严重，禾苗发黄不长的时候，尽管地多人少，水源不足，工具不全，广大社员拿起一切可以利用的工具，大规模的展开了水浇地运动。广大农民说：
    “别看老天它闹大旱，
    我们有党的总路线；
    天不下雨就用人浇，
    多快好省的把地灌，
    来它个蚂蚁搬山‘术’，
    万众齐心闯过旱关。”
    就这样满山遍野的展开了一场顽强的抗旱斗争，终于战胜了天旱，保住了禾苗的生长发育。在全年里无论是抗击旱、涝、风、虫等各方面的自然灾害斗争中，或者在完成各项增产措施上，都是在充分发挥广大群众的建设社会主义的干劲中，得到解决的，我们是常年的坚持贯彻了“有困难就组织群众‘辩’，有经验就组织群众‘看’，有标兵就发动群众‘比’，无论困难大小也不停止的‘干’”。这样经常的保持了广大农民顽强旺盛的斗志。因为人的主观能动性是生产斗争中最活跃的因素。当然，在充分发挥广大群众的主观能动作用，克服了各种困难的同时，一九五八年在农业生产上基本上掌握和执行了农业“八字宪法”的要求，提高了和改进了许多耕作方法、制度，提高了广大群众的农业增产技术水平，从而使增产粮食的劳动大军，既有勇、又有谋、既有冲天干劲，又掌握了一定的增产技术，这在一九五八年也是一个很大的进步，这同时也是去年空前丰收的重要原因。
    尽管如此，由于一九五八年全面大跃进的形势出现，加之农业增产任务的艰巨，所以在上半年对林、牧、副、渔等多种经营上，总是“心有余而力不足”。突出的表现在受着劳力不足，生产季节性的限制，人力调不开扇。只有从去年九月实现了公社化之后，建立了公共食堂，托儿所，从繁琐的家务劳动中解放了广大农村妇女，从而使她们补充和扩大了劳动力的主力军，才逐渐缓和了这个尖锐矛盾。仅举肇源县的渔产为例：过去全县淡水鱼的年产量只在八百万斤左右，一九五八年大跃进之后，提高到一千六百万斤（翻了一番）。但是在公社化以后，经过全体社员去冬今春的努力，一九五九年鱼的年产量，将有可能达到六亿斤左右，这将比一九五八年跃进产量提高三十七倍多。其他方面的多种经营生产，也都要有个大发展。农民们说：“互助组是泥饭碗，初级社是瓷饭碗，高级社是铁饭碗，人民公社是金饭碗”。他们形容对公社的希望说：“公社成立刚半年，好比鲜花开半边；要是再过几年后，力量就要胜过天”。
    仅从这些初步的成就上看，人民公社就显示了这样大的优越性。从农民的收入上看，举绥化县七一管理区为例，在一九五八年的总收入中（不包括家庭副业每户约二百元左右的收入在内）扣除国家税收，下年的生产费用，公积金，公益金，管理费，社员收入比上年增加的情况是：
    年　度　  每户平均收入        　每户每人平均收入
   一九五七年　三四八元      　        六二元
    一九五八年　六○○元　            一○五元
    一九五九年（预计）一三○○元左右　二二○元左右
    在一九五八年的大跃进中，农民的收入水平有了更显著的提高，生活得到了又进一步的改善，在这个大跃进中，广大农民也受到了一次深刻的锻炼。广大群众也深刻的认识到，按照党的总路线，充分发扬广大人民建设社会主义的干劲，好好听党的话，没有克服不了的困难。
    各位代表，正当我们伟大祖国处在如此光辉灿烂的时代，祖国人民正在建设和平幸福生活的康庄大道上，万马奔腾，成绩辉煌的时候，西藏一小撮上层反动分子却在印度扩张主义者的指使和支持下，公开武装叛乱、背叛祖国，妄图在西藏恢复帝国主义的侵略势力，使西藏人民永远沦为暗无天日的人间地狱。这一滔天叛国罪行引起了全国人民的莫大愤慨。这个西藏反动叛国集团，不但把达赖喇嘛劫入印度境内，而且又于四月十八日在印度的提斯浦尔地方，竟然由印度外交官员散发了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，对此，我们表示极大的愤怒。这篇所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，充分的暴露了完全是歪曲事实，颠倒黑白的捏造。这纯粹是外国侵略者和西藏叛乱分子共同捏造的东西。我们要正告他们，我国人民决不允许任何外国反动派干涉中国内政，中国人民内部的一切大事小事，决不允许任何外国人插手。已经走上了幸福美满生活的中国人民，完全明白谁是敌人，谁是朋友，我们要的是真诚的友谊，我们完全可以看出谁在那里玩鬼把戏。我们要警告帝国主义和那些嘴甜心苦干涉我国内政的那些人，你们对中国人民的任何阴谋诡计都是枉费心机的，你们要知道，中国人民是热爱和平的，但也决不是谁都可以欺负我们的。凡是过去想欺负我们的人，吃亏的都是他们，兴盛昌隆的还是我们这些从来不想欺负别人的人们。你们记住这个历史教训吧！
    我们听了总理的报告中所提出的一九五九年的任务，我们极为兴奋，并有高度的信心去超额完成我们应该完成的那些光荣任务。我们一定要为在这公社化的第一年和迎接我们伟大祖国的国庆十周年中，同广大人民一道进一步深入贯彻执行党的建设社会主义总路线与农业八字宪法，认真的把公社办的更好，一定要信心百倍的争取今年在增产粮食上，打一个比去年还胜利的仗。
