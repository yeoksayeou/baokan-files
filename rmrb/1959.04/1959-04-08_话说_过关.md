    On "Passing the Barrier"
  　Xiāo Pī'ān
    The expression "passing the barrier" is being borrowed more and more in our country's socialist construction Great Leap Forward. For example, the machinery industry must overcome the barriers of insufficient capacity and low technology; the forestry industry must overcome the "three barriers" of developing new forest areas, comprehensive utilization of resources, and technological revolution. After winter wheat passes the greening-up stage, it must then pass the jointing stage, and so on. "Passing the barrier" is a good and vivid metaphor. In the struggle to complete various construction tasks, clearly pointing out which barriers must be overcome means grasping the main contradictions and key points. This will give builders a clear understanding and direction, making it easier to deploy forces effectively, break through the fortresses on the road ahead one by one, and resolve the contradictions one by one. Each resolution of a contradiction means passing a barrier, and each passage of a barrier is a step closer to the established goal, reaching a new realm and a new peak.
    Of course, overcoming barriers in construction undertakings is not like Guan Yu passing five barriers back in the day, relying solely on courage. This is because the barriers to be overcome do not have the names of passes and the flags of defending generals written on them. What barriers need to be overcome must be discovered from the complicated phenomena of things. That is to say, in the specific process of practice, one must possess a large amount of material about the object of one's work, and find its objective laws through scientific analysis, in order to discover where the barriers lie. Only then can forces be deployed correctly, command be appropriate, obstacles be removed, and the barrier be conquered. If the target is mistaken and the wrong barrier is found, even if a brave attack is launched, it will still be ineffective. Here, scientific analysis is extremely important. Correctly pointing out where the barriers lie in one's work is precisely the skill that a leader must learn.

    话说“过关”
  　萧丕安
    “过关”这个字眼，在我国社会主义建设大跃进中，越来越多地被借用着了。比如，机械工业要过好能力不足、技术不高的关；森林工业要过好开发新林区、资源综合利用和技术革命这“三关”。冬小麦在过了返青关以后，接着就要过拔节关，等等。“过关”，这是个形象化的好比喻，在为完成各项建设任务的斗争中，明确指出要过哪几关，这就是抓住了主要矛盾和主要关键，这会使建设者心中有数，方向明确，便于更好地部署力量，把横在前进道路上的堡垒一个一个地攻破，把矛盾一个一个地解决。每解决一个矛盾，就是过了一关，而每过了一关，又都是向既定的奋斗目标接近了一步。达到一个新的境界和新的高峰。
    当然，在建设事业中的过关，不像关云长当年过五关那样只凭勇力就行。因为，所要过的关并没有写着关隘的名字和守将的旗号，究竟要过哪些关，这是要在头绪纷繁的事物现象中去发现的，也就是说要在具体的实践过程中，对自己工作的对象，占有大量的材料，经过科学分析，找到它的客观规律，才能够发现关隘所在。然后才能正确地部署力量，指挥得宜，拔除阻碍，夺关前进。如果弄错了目标，找错了关口，虽然也进行了勇猛的冲击，仍然会不得要领。在这里，科学的分析就是极为重要的了。而正确指出自己工作中的关隘所在，这正是一个领导者所必须学会的本领。
