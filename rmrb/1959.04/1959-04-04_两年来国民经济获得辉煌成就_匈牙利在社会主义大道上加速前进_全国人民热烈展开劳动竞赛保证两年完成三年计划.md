Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 3rd - The Hungarian people have made brilliant achievements in socialist construction over the past two years. Currently, the people throughout the country are joyfully accelerating socialist construction.

In the past two years, thanks to the correct policies implemented by the Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, the proletarian regime and the worker-peasant alliance have been increasingly consolidated. Industrial and agricultural production in 1957 exceeded the level of 1955. The people's lives have also generally improved.

In the first half of 1958, the Party and the Government proposed a three-year plan for developing the national economy. The completion of this plan will lay a solid foundation for the new five-year plan. Last year, the Hungarian people successfully completed the first year's tasks stipulated in the three-year plan. In 1958, the total value of industrial production increased by 12% compared to 1957, exceeding the original plan by 4.7%; the production cost of industrial departments was originally planned to be reduced by 3%, but it actually decreased by 5%; labor productivity was originally planned to increase by 6.4%, but it actually increased by 8%.

Although agricultural production was affected by the weather last year, it still completed the targets stipulated in the original plan, increasing by 5% compared to 1957, due to the development of animal husbandry and the bumper harvests of grapes and fruits.

In 1958, in terms of foreign trade, the export plan was overfulfilled by 12%, and the import plan was overfulfilled by 2%.

Great achievements were also made last year in adjusting the structure of industrial production. In the past, about 80% of basic raw materials had to rely on imports. In 1958, on the one hand, the production of basic raw materials was increased, and on the other hand, the production of some unnecessary products was reduced or stopped. In order to solve the difficulty of raw material supply, a movement to save raw materials was also launched among employees throughout the country, and a supervisor system was established.
Agricultural Cooperativization Movement Enters a New Upsurge This Spring
Forty Percent of Villages Have All Farmers Joining Cooperatives

In the past two years, certain achievements have also been made in the socialist transformation of agriculture. The cooperative movement has developed rapidly. In the past year alone, more than 400 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established across the country, and the area of land joining the cooperatives has increased by 250,000 hectares. In 1958, the grain income per hectare of cooperatives was 20% higher than that of individual farmers.

Since the beginning of spring this year, the agricultural cooperativization movement has continued to develop at a rapid pace. In just three months, the cultivated land area of cooperatives has increased from 26.5% at the end of last year (of which the cultivated land area of state-owned farms accounted for about 13%) to 48%. Now, all farmers in more than 1,300 villages across the country have joined cooperatives, accounting for 40% of the country's villages. The Győr-Sopron region has fully realized cooperativization.

Workers throughout the country are vigorously supporting the development of the cooperative movement. They have proposed to oversupply agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and building materials. Many employees have also personally participated in the propaganda and organizational work of cooperatives, helping farmers build cattle and horse sheds and repair agricultural tools.
This Year's Industrial Production Plan is Well Completed
Spring plowing and sowing are progressing rapidly, and fertilizer application has greatly increased

At present, Hungarian farmers' production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. This year's spring plowing and sowing work is the earliest completed in the past decade, and deep plowing and careful cultivation have been achieved. The amount of fertilizer applied per hectare of land has also greatly increased compared to the past.

The industrial plans for January and February this year have also been well completed. The total output value of state-owned industries has increased by 5% compared to the same period last year, and the average export volume has increased by 21% compared to the same period last year.

On March 6th this year, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held a plenary session, calling on the people throughout the country to strive to complete the main targets of the three-year plan within two years. The working people of the country enthusiastically responded to this call. Party organizations, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, industrial enterprises, and rural areas at all levels have universally discussed the decision of the Party Central Committee and have successively put forward guarantees to complete this task.

Currently, a vigorous socialist labor emulation campaign to complete the three-year plan ahead of schedule has been universally launched across the country. (Attached picture)

    两年来国民经济获得辉煌成就
    匈牙利在社会主义大道上加速前进
    全国人民热烈展开劳动竞赛保证两年完成三年计划
    工农业生产迅速地恢复和发展
    三年计划第一年任务胜利完成
    新华社布达佩斯3日电　匈牙利人民两年来在社会主义建设方面已取得辉煌的成就。目前全国人民正在欢欣鼓舞地加速社会主义的建设。
    两年来，由于社会主义工人党和工农革命政府执行了正确的政策，无产阶级政权和工农联盟日益巩固。工农业生产在1957年便超过了1955年的水平。人民的生活也普遍提高。
    1958年上半年党和政府提出了发展国民经济的三年计划。这个计划的完成，将为新的五年计划奠定巩固的基础。去年，匈牙利人民胜利地完成了三年计划规定的第一年的任务。1958年工业生产总值较1957年增长了12％，超过原定计划的4.7％；部属工业的生产成本原定降低3％，实际降低了5％；劳动生产率原定提高6.4％，而实际提高了8％。
    去年农业生产虽然受气候影响，但由于畜牧业的发展和葡萄、水果的大丰收，仍然完成了原计划规定的指标，较1957年增加了5％。
    1958年在对外贸易方面，出口计划超额完成了12％，进口计划超额完成了2％。
    在调整工业生产结构方面，去年也获得了很大的成绩。过去约80％的基本原料要依靠进口，在1958年，一方面提高了基本原料的生产，另一方面减少或停止了一些不必要的产品生产。为了解决原料供应的困难，全国职工还掀起了节约原料的运动，并建立了监督员制度。农业合作化运动今春进入新高潮
  百分之四十的村庄全体农民入社
    过去两年来，在农业社会主义改造方面也取得了一定的成绩。合作化运动发展得很快，仅在去年一年内全国就新成立了四百多个农业生产合作社，入社土地增加了二十五万霍尔特。1958年合作社每霍尔特的谷物收入比个体农民多20％。
    今年开春以来，农业合作化运动继续以飞快的速度发展着。在短短的三个月内，合作社的耕地面积就从去年年底的26.5％（其中国营农场的耕地面积占13％左右）增加到48％。现在全国有一千三百多个村庄的全村农民加入合作社，占全国农村的40％。吉厄尔—索普伦等州已经全部实现了合作化。
    全国工人大力支援合作化运动的发展，他们提出要超额供应农业机器、化学肥料和建筑材料；很多职工并亲自参加合作社的宣传和组织工作，帮助农民建设牛马房和修理农具等。今年工业生产计划完成得好
  春耕春播进展迅速施肥大增
    目前，匈牙利农民的生产情绪空前高涨，今年的春耕春播工作是十年来完成得最早的一年，并且做到深耕细作，每霍尔特土地所施的肥料也比以前大大增加。
    今年1、2月份的工业计划也完成得很好，国家工业的总产值比去年同一时期增加了5％，出口量平均比去年同一时期增加了21％。
    今年3月6日匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会举行了全会，号召全国人民在两年内争取完成三年计划的主要指标。全国劳动人民热烈地响应了这一号召。各级党组织、工会、共青团、各工业企业和农村都普遍讨论了党中央的决定，并且纷纷提出了完成这一任务的保证。
    目前，一个轰轰烈烈的为提前完成三年计划的社会主义劳动竞赛已在全国普遍地展开。（附图片）
