Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, Belgrade Dispatch: After the Tibetan rebellion, Yugoslav newspapers blatantly stood on the side of imperialism, singing the same tune, and launched vicious slanders and attacks against China.

In reporting and commenting on the Tibetan rebellion, the newspapers of the Yugoslav revisionist clique deliberately distorted the nature and cause of the event. They tried hard to create the impression that the events in Tibet were not an armed rebellion planned by a small number of reactionary upper-class elements in Tibet in collusion with foreign reactionaries, but an "uprising against Chinese occupation troops and administrators." (Liberation Daily, Yugoslavia, March 26)

The People's Army Daily on April 10 further slandered that the cause of the Tibetan rebellion "can only be found in the shortcomings of the Chinese central government's ethnic policies."

The News Weekly on April 12 carried out malicious defamation, saying that "the Chinese leadership is essentially following the same path as the old imperial China on the issue of nationalities." Borba (The Struggle) described the rebellion as an event "on a national scale," insisting that "no matter who the leaders of the rebellion are, the rebellion has certain national characteristics."

Although some Yugoslav newspapers had to admit that the Tibetan armed rebellion was China's internal affair, and that Tibet was a part of China, they indirectly denied this point. Apart from the map published by Politika which included Tibet and Xinjiang within the Chinese borders, Borba said that the Tibetan rebellion took place in a "country that demonstrates national characteristics." The Liberation Daily's supplement "The World" said that Tibet was "the only country where monks control all—religious and secular—power," and that it was a "country of farmers, herdsmen, and Buddhist monks." The News Weekly on April 12 even forcibly linked the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in handling relations between countries with China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, a purely internal affair, saying that the events that have occurred and are occurring in Tibet "indirectly" "violate" the "Panchsheel" (Five Principles). This weekly even arrogantly said: "For the Asian region, Tibet is not just a part of China."

Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, April 23rd: In recent days, Yugoslav newspapers have actively promoted the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement."

Borba on the 19th published a Reuters report on the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" with a prominent four-column headline. The headline of the newspaper was: "The Dalai Lama left Tibet and arrived in India according to his own will." Politika on the same day published the same news with a two-column headline.

However, Borba on the 21st only published a very brief "Xinhua News Agency on the Dalai Lama's statement" (headline) in the "Latest News" section with a one-column headline. This commentary by a Xinhua News Agency political reporter, after being processed by the newspaper, was completely distorted.

### 铁托集团又逞诽谤本领  南报刊竟说西藏叛乱是“起义”

    铁托集团又逞诽谤本领
    南报刊竟说西藏叛乱是“起义”
    新华社24日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫报刊在西藏叛乱事件发生后，公然同帝国主义站在一边，一个鼻孔出气，向中国发出了恶毒的污蔑和攻击。
    南斯拉夫修正主义集团的报刊在报道和评论西藏叛乱事件时，对事件的性质和起因进行了别有用心的歪曲。它们竭力企图给人造成这样的印象，好像在西藏发生的事件并不是西藏少数上层反动分子勾结外国反动派所策划的武装叛乱，而是对“中国占领军和管理者的起义”。（南斯拉夫3月26日“解放报”）
    4月10日的“人民军报”更诬蔑说，西藏叛乱的原因“只能到中国中央政府的民族政策的缺点中去找寻”。
    4月12日的“新闻周报”进行了恶毒诽谤，说什么“中国领导在民族问题上实质上同帝王的旧中国走的是同一条道路”。“战斗报”把这次叛乱描绘成为“一个民族范围的”事件，硬说“不管叛乱的领袖是谁，叛乱具有一定的民族特点。”
    南斯拉夫的一些报刊虽然也曾不得不承认西藏的武装叛乱是中国的内政，承认西藏是中国的一部分，但是它们又旁敲侧击地否认这一点？除了“政治报”刊登的地图把西藏和新疆划在中国国界之外，“战斗报”曾说什么西藏叛乱发生在一个“表现出民族特性的国家里”。“解放报”的副刊“世界”说西藏是“唯一的僧侣掌握全部——宗教的和世俗的——权力的国家”，是“农夫、牧民和佛教僧侣的国家”。4月12日的“新闻周报”更把处理国与国之间关系的和平共处五项原则硬同中国平定西藏叛乱这一纯属内政问题乱扯在一起，说什么在西藏已经发生和正在发生的事件“间接地”“触犯”了“潘查希拉”（五项原则）。这家周报竟狂妄地说：“对亚洲地区来说，西藏不只是中国的组成部分。”
    新华社贝尔格莱德23日电　近几天的南斯拉夫报纸积极地为所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”作宣传。
  　19日的“战斗报”曾以四栏标题的显著地位发表了路透社报道的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。报纸的标题是：“达赖喇嘛离开西藏到达印度是根据自己的意志的”。同一天的“政治报”以两栏标题发表了同一消息。
    而21日的“战斗报”在“最后消息”中仅以一栏标题的地位极简短地刊登了“新华社谈达赖喇嘛的声明”（标题）。经报纸加工后的这则新华社政治记者的评论已是面目全非。
