Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, Washington Dispatch: Some representatives of the reactionary ruling group in the United States continue to fan the flames in Asia by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion, and seize the opportunity to promote the aggressive policies pursued by American imperialism in Asia.

U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy on the 22nd slandered our country's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as the "ruthlessness of the Chinese Communists," which "revealed its true colors" in front of the so-called "free world."

Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson, known for his hostility towards the Chinese people, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 21st and made a vicious slander against China. He called the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion in Tibet a "shocking suppression of freedom," and he attempted to use this nonsense to "illustrate" China's "ever-increasing arrogance." Robertson also maliciously referred to the small group of rebellious elements in Tibet as the "Tibetan people," and he slandered the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion as "taking up arms against the Tibetan people."

Robertson also deliberately provoked in his speech, saying that "the bloody and unreasonable actions of Communist China have exposed its true face to its Asian neighbors." But the actual situation is that Robertson revealed in his speech the American ruling group's intention to use the Tibetan rebellion to fan the flames in Asia and promote the U.S. aggressive policy. He immediately advocated that the Far Eastern countries need American "help" to "deal with the threats and difficulties they face." He clamored that the United States "is worth paying all costs" for the "freedom" of the Far East.

U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations Lodge, in a speech at a gathering of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations on the 23rd, slandered the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion as an "unspeakable atrocity." He hysterically shouted that the rebellion in Tibet "shows that there is an imperialism in Beijing."

This spokesperson for Wall Street then advocated using the Tibetan rebellion to support the U.S.'s consistent reactionary stance of obstructing the restoration of our country's legitimate seat in the United Nations. He clamored: "This barbaric action of the CCP once again proves that everything we have done to prevent Communist China from entering the United Nations is correct." He said that the U.S. government will use the Tibetan rebellion "once again to spare no effort" to make this policy "victorious."

The "New York Post" published an article by Mrs. Roosevelt yesterday, in which she warned the so-called "free world" in an obviously provocative tone not to place their future on written agreements reached with the Communists. She slandered China's suppression of the rebellion as "tearing up agreements" and "achieving goals by force."

    美国利用西藏叛乱鼓吹侵略
    统治集团代表人物大肆诬蔑我国以图迷惑亚洲国家
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国反动统治集团的一些代表人物继续利用西藏叛乱事件在亚洲煽风点火，并乘机宣扬美帝国主义在亚洲所推行的侵略政策。
    美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊22日诬蔑我国镇压西藏叛乱是“中国共产党的残酷无情”，是在所谓“自由世界”面前“现了原形”。
    以敌视中国人民著称的美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊21日在众议院外交委员会作证时，对中国进行了一次恶毒的诬蔑。他把中国政府平定西藏的武装叛乱叫做是“对自由的令人震惊的镇压”，他并且企图用这种胡说来“说明”中国的“有增无已的蛮横态度”。罗伯逊还恶意地把西藏的一小撮叛乱分子称作“西藏人民”，他诬蔑中国政府镇压武装叛乱是“拿起武器对付西藏人民”。
    罗伯逊在讲话中还别有用心地挑拨说，“共产党中国的这种血腥和蛮不讲理的行动已经向它的亚洲邻居暴露了它的真面目。”但是实际情况恰恰是罗伯逊在自己的讲话中暴露了美国统治集团想利用西藏叛乱事件在亚洲煽风点火，推行美国侵略政策的目的。他在讲话中紧接着就鼓吹远东国家需要美国的“帮助”来“对付它们所遭到的威胁和困难”。他叫嚣美国为了远东的“自由”“值得付出一切代价”。
    美国驻联合国首席代表洛奇23日在芝加哥外交学会集会的演说中，诬蔑中国政府镇压叛乱是“不可言喻的暴行”。他歇斯底里地叫喊说，西藏的叛乱“说明在北京有着一个帝国主义”。
    这个华尔街的代言人接着就鼓吹利用西藏叛乱事件来支持美国一贯阻挠恢复我国在联合国合法席位的反动立场。他叫嚷道：“中共这一次野蛮的行动再一次证明，我们为了不让共产党中国进入联合国而做的一切是正确的。”他表示美国政府将利用西藏叛乱“再一次不遗余力地”使这个政策“获得胜利”。
    “纽约邮报”昨天刊登了罗斯福夫人的一篇文章，她以明显的挑拨语气向所谓“自由世界”提出警告，要它们不要把将来寄托在同共产党达成的文字协定上。她诬蔑中国镇压叛乱是“撕毁协定”，“用武力达到目的”。
