Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 25th: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation led by Marshal Peng Dehuai arrived in Szczecin, a coastal city in northwestern Poland, on April 25th for a visit. Accompanying the delegation was Bo Zhiwowski, Deputy Minister of National Defense of Poland and Chief of the General Staff of the Polish People's Army.

　　In the evening, the delegation attended the 14th anniversary celebration of the liberation of Szczecin.

　　Speeches were given at the meeting by Polish United Workers' Party Central Political Bureau member and Minister of National Defense Spychalski, who had traveled from Warsaw to attend the meeting. He emphasized the significance of Polish-Soviet friendship in defending the Oder River border, and he also spoke about the role of the Warsaw Pact.

　　Marshal Peng Dehuai then spoke at the meeting. First, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he extended sincere congratulations and high respect to the citizens of Szczecin, and through them, to the Polish people and the Polish People's Army.

　　Marshal Peng Dehuai emphasized that the general trend of the current world situation is: the enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day. However, the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States is not reconciled to its defeat and is still painstakingly plotting and carrying out aggressive activities. The reactionary ruling group in West Germany, with the help of the United States, is plotting to annex the German Democratic Republic and is attempting to undermine the existing peaceful border between Poland and Germany in order to realize its territorial ambitions towards Poland. However, the imperialists' conspiracy will not succeed. Any provocations and attacks against the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and other socialist countries will inevitably be resolutely countered by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the world's peaceful and democratic forces, and will end in shameful failure.

　　Today, the delegation visited the Szczecin Shipyard and then visited the Szczecin troops of the Polish Coastal Military Region. During a meeting with the soldiers, Marshal Peng Dehuai gave a speech. He emphasized the friendship between the armies of China and Poland.

    我军事代表团访问什切青
    参加什切青市解放十四周年庆祝大会
    据新华社华沙25日电　由彭德怀元帅率领的中国军事友好代表团，25日乘飞机到达波兰西北部的滨海城市什切青访问。陪同代表团访问的是波兰国防部副部长、波兰人民军总参谋长博齐沃夫斯基。
    当晚，代表团参加了什切青市解放十四周年庆祝大会。
    从华沙赶来参加大会的波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基在会上讲了话。他强调指出了波苏友谊对保卫奥得河边界的意义，他并且谈到了华沙条约的作用。
    彭德怀元帅接着在会上讲了话。他首先代表中国人民和中国人民解放军向什切青市民并通过他们向波兰人民和波兰人民军致以衷心的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    彭德怀元帅强调指出，目前世界局势总的趋势是：敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团并不甘心自己的失败，仍在处心积虑地策划和进行侵略活动。西德反动统治集团正在美国的帮助下，阴谋吞并德意志民主共和国，并且妄图破坏波、德之间现存的和平边界，以实现它对波兰的领土野心。但是，帝国主义者的阴谋是不能得逞的，他们对德意志民主共和国、波兰和其他社会主义国家的任何挑衅和进攻，都必将遭到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界和平民主力量的坚决回击，而归于可耻的失败。
    代表团今天参观了什切青造船厂，随后，又访问了波兰沿海军区驻什切青部队。在和士兵们会见时，彭德怀元帅讲了话。他强调指出了中波两国军队之间的友谊。
