Chairman, fellow representatives:

    I represent Wang Xingyao, Shi Mukang, Liu Jingji, Hu Ziying, Hu Juewen, Rong Yiren, Sheng Pihua, Tang Diyi, and Wei Ru to make a joint statement.
    We attended this conference with excitement and enthusiasm, listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. We deeply recognize the great significance of this meeting, which is a conference of unity and a conference of great leaps forward. In the reports of the leading comrades of the Party and the government, the glorious achievements made by the Party and Chairman Mao in leading the people of the whole country in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country in the past few years were summarized, especially the unprecedented Great Leap Forward movement launched by the people of the whole country under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" last year. The production of steel, iron, grain, cotton, etc. in our country doubled that of 1957, and equally great achievements have been made on other fronts. Based on the victorious achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the 1959 National Economic Plan, centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, was proposed. The absolute value of the total industrial and agricultural output value will exceed the 80.9 billion yuan increase from 1957 to 1958, reaching 82 billion yuan, and a total of 1,092 projects above the construction limit will be carried out. The leap forward in 1958 was an unprecedented leap forward; and the national economic plan in 1959 is a larger, better, and more comprehensive continuous leap forward. This fully proves the correctness and greatness of the Party's wise leadership, the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, and the infinite wisdom and strength of the working people. The rapid development and grand scale of our country's socialist construction are beyond the reach of even the most developed capitalist countries, causing them to be panic-stricken. Looking back on the past, the flags of victory are flying everywhere; looking forward to the future, a great socialist motherland with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture is as if before our eyes. We not only feel fortunate and glorious, but also, thanks to the Party's continuous education and training for the past ten years, we are determined and confident to join the nationwide continuous Great Leap Forward under the leadership of the working class and the broad masses of working people, strengthen self-reform, and actively contribute all our strength to the cause of socialist construction.
    In the past year, we Shanghai industrialists and businessmen, under the leadership of the Party, have undergone profound education through the rectification movement of breaking the bourgeois stand and establishing the socialist stand, and have made varying degrees of improvement politically and ideologically. After the rectification, the vast majority of people formulated self-reform plans, and, on the basis of increasing understanding, launched the "three togethers" movement of eating, living, and working together with the working people, and the "double dedication" movement of dedicating skills and dedicating ideas. Many people went to workshops, counters, and lower-level labor training, supported agricultural production, etc., stayed with workers and peasants, learned their noble qualities, and also had some performance in production labor, initially improving their relationship with the working people. Under the supervision and help of the working masses, some people have performed well in their jobs, some have worked with workers in enterprises to trial-produce new products, some have overcome some cutting-edge science and technology, some have provided rationalization proposals and improved production tools, and some have improved business management, contributing some strength to the implementation of the general line of socialist construction and the national Great Leap Forward with steel as the key link.
    In our work practice, we deeply realize that any achievements we have made in the past year are inseparable from the Party's leadership and concern, and the help and support of the working masses. With the Party pointing out the direction for us and the working masses leading the way for us, it is possible for us to play a certain role in socialist construction. However, compared with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and laborers, it is negligible and far behind. At the same time, since our political stance has not been completely resolved and duality still exists, there are still many problems in our thinking or in our actions. The development of the "three togethers" and "double dedication" movements of Shanghai industrialists and businessmen is uneven. Some people do not have enough understanding of the significance of "three togethers," and some are perfunctory in "double dedication"; sometimes they are cold and sometimes they are hot in their work, sometimes they are active and sometimes they are passive; they understand this problem, but they do not understand that problem; for this year's greater leap forward, on the one hand, they feel excited and want to do something, but sometimes they feel nervous and cannot bear it; they want to "get on the horse," but they are afraid of "getting on the horse," worrying too much, and hesitating; although they have a certain understanding of the Party's leadership and the Party's greatness and correctness, we often suspect and speculate about the Party in our actual actions or ideological activities, and are restless; although we know that we must learn from the working masses, we often cannot humbly ask for advice in our work. These facts hinder us from serving better and also show that our transformation is still a long-term, repeated, and arduous process. Chairman Mao taught us: "The complete transformation of industrialists and businessmen must be in the process of work. They should work with the workers and staff in the enterprise and take the enterprise as the base for self-transformation." Premier Zhou also pointed out in the Government Work Report: "For capitalists... we will actively help them continue their self-education and self-transformation in participating in socialist construction." We have had a certain improvement in our ideological understanding through the education of the anti-rightist rectification campaign. We have the conditions and the possibility to gradually overcome shortcomings and strengthen self-reform in actively serving. We must follow the teachings of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, resolutely implement the guiding principle of taking political and ideological transformation as the commander, taking labor and production practice as the foundation, taking enterprises or work posts as the base, and combining the three, actively participate in socialist construction, establish socialist positions and ideas, break capitalist positions and ideas, gradually cultivate love for the socialist cause, more sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, learn the revolutionary vigor of workers and peasants, and strive to give play to subjective initiative in different work posts, go all out, persevere, overcome difficulties, and make achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of our great motherland!
    Fellow representatives, when all ethnic groups in our country, including Tibetan compatriots, are closely united around the Chinese Communist Party and are courageously advancing towards this year's greater leap forward, striving to build our country into a great socialist country as soon as possible, a small handful of the original Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary groups dream of forever preserving the cruel serf system, colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, openly carrying out armed rebellion, and attempting to split the motherland and turn Tibet into a colony and protectorate. This armed rebellion, which betrays the motherland and undermines unity, has been resolutely opposed by the broad masses of monks, nuns, and people in Tibet and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and has suffered a shameful defeat. We Shanghai industrialists and businessmen firmly support the government's policy of thoroughly crushing the rebellion activities of reactionary elements. What makes us indignant is that India, our great neighbor who has suffered from imperialist oppression like our country in the past and jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with our country, has a group of expansionists who are making a clamor to interfere in our country's internal affairs and colluding with our country's rebellious elements who have fled to India, attempting to play the trick of so-called Tibetan "independence" and trying to separate Tibet from our motherland. What surprises us even more is that the content of the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," which was openly displayed on the 18th of this month in Tezpur, India, with the banner of Tibetan "independence," was distributed by Indian diplomatic officials. Prime Minister Nehru has said that "political activities against another country are not allowed to be carried out in India." Was the Indian official unaware that such a political document openly attacking the Chinese government was being distributed by Indian diplomatic officials? We solemnly tell the Indian expansionists that Tibet has long been an inseparable part of Chinese territory, which is universally recognized by the whole world, including India. Our country's action to quell the rebellion is entirely China's internal affair. The Chinese people who have stood up will never tolerate any foreign interference. The era when imperialism and foreign reactionary forces split China and manipulated China's internal affairs has long gone forever. We must also point out that the activities of Indian expansionists in interfering in China's internal affairs violate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which will inevitably be opposed by the vast number of peace-loving people in India. Now that the Tibetan rebellion has been quelled, the Tibetan people will surely be able to unite with the people of all ethnic groups in the country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, get rid of the shackles of the serf system, and build a democratic, prosperous, and happy new Tibet. This is something that no one can stop.

    消除疑虑　继续积极改造
    王性尧　史慕康　刘靖基胡子婴　胡厥文　荣毅仁  盛丕华　汤蒂因　魏如代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我代表王性尧、史慕康、刘靖基、胡子婴、胡厥文、荣毅仁、盛丕华、汤蒂因、魏如作联合发言。
    我们出席了这次大会，满怀着兴奋和激动的心情，听取了周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划的报告、李先念副总理的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算的报告、彭真副委员长的全国人大常务委员会工作报告，深刻认识到这次会议的重大意义，这是一次团结的大会，是跃进的大会。党和政府领导同志的报告中，总结了几年来党和毛主席领导全国人民在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得的辉煌成就，特别是去年在党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民掀起了史无前例的一个大跃进运动，我国的钢、铁、粮、棉等等生产比一九五七年的产量翻了一番，在其它各个战线上也同样取得了巨大的成就。并且在一九五八年大跃进取得胜利的基础上提出了以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的一九五九年国民经济计划。工农业总产值的绝对数将超过一九五八年比一九五七年增长的八百零九亿元而达到八百二十亿元，进行建设的限额以上的项目共有一千零九十二个。一九五八年的跃进是史无前例的跃进；而一九五九年的国民经济计划是更大、更好、更全面的继续跃进。这充分证明了党的英明领导的正确和伟大，社会主义制度的无比优越性，和劳动人民的无限智慧和力量。我们国家的社会主义建设事业的飞速发展和宏伟气魄，即使是那些最发达的资本主义国家也是望尘莫及而使他们惊惶失措。我们回顾既往，处处都是胜利的旗帜迎风飘扬；瞻望将来，一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义祖国如在眼前。我们不仅感到幸运和光荣，而且，由于十年来党对我们的不断教育和培养，我们有决心、有信心在工人阶级和广大劳动人民的带领下，投进全国继续大跃进的热潮中，加强自我改造，积极为社会主义建设事业贡献我们的全部力量。
    我们上海工商业者，过去一年中，在党的领导下，通过了破资产阶级立场，立社会主义立场的整风运动，受到了深刻的教育，政治上思想上有了不同程度的提高。整风以后，绝大多数人订立了自我改造规划，并且，在提高认识的基础上开展了和劳动人民同吃、同住、同劳动的“三同”运动和献技、献计的“双献”运动，不少人下车间、上柜台、下放劳动锻炼，支援农业生产等，和工人农民在一起，学习他们的高贵品质，在生产劳动中也有了一些表现，初步改善了和劳动人民的关系。在工人群众的督促和帮助下，有些人在工作岗位上有了较好的表现，有些人在企业中和工人一道试制了新产品，有的攻克了一些尖端科学技术，有的提供了合理化建议和改进了生产工具，有的改善了经营管理，在贯彻社会主义建设总路线和以钢为纲的全民大跃进中，贡献了一些力量。
    我们在工作实践中深深体会到，我们在去年一年中的任何成绩，都是和党的领导与关怀，和工人群众的帮助支持分不开的。有党给我们指出了前进的方向，工人群众在我们前面带路，我们才有可能在社会主义建设中起到一定的作用。但是，和工农广大劳动人民比起来，却是微不足道的，是相差很远的。同时，由于我们的政治立场还没有彻底解决，两面性依然存在，无论在思想上或在行动表现上还存在着不少问题。我们上海工商业者的“三同”和“双献”运动，发展是不平衡的，有的对“三同”的意义认识不够，有的对“双献”敷衍塞责；在工作中时冷时热，有时积极，有时消极；对这一问题通了，对那一个问题又不通；对于今年更大的跃进，一方面感到兴奋，想有所作为，但有时又感到紧张，吃不消；既想“上马”，又害怕“上马”，患得患失，顾虑多端；对党的领导和党的伟大和正确，虽有一定认识，但是我们往往在实际行动或思想活动中，对党怀疑猜测，动荡不安；我们虽然知道要向工人群众学习，但是我们在工作中往往不能虚心请教。这些事实，障碍了我们更好的服务，同时也说明了我们的改造仍是一个长期的、反复的、艰巨的过程。毛主席教导我们说：“工商业者的彻底改造，必须在工作中间，他们应当在企业内同职工一起劳动，把企业作为自我改造的基地。”周总理在政府工作报告中也指出：“对于资本家……将积极帮助他们在参加社会主义建设中继续进行自我教育和自我改造。”我们经过了反右整风的教育，思想认识有了一定的提高。我们有条件也有可能在积极服务中逐步克服缺点，加强自我改造。我们一定要遵照毛主席和周总理的教导，坚决贯彻以政治思想改造为统帅，以劳动和生产实践为基础，以企业或工作岗位为基地，并把这三者结合起来的方针，积极参加社会主义建设，立社会主义立场和思想，破资本主义立场和思想，逐步培养对社会主义事业的热爱，更真诚地接受党的领导，学习工人农民热火朝天的革命干劲，力争在不同的工作岗位上发挥主观能动性，全力以赴，锲而不舍，克服困难，作出成绩，来迎接我们伟大的祖国国庆十周年！
    各位代表，当我们全国各族人民，包括藏族同胞在内，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，为着今年的更大跃进，争取把我国早日建设成为伟大的社会主义国家而奋勇前进的时候，一小撮原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团却梦想永远保存残酷的农奴制度，勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，公开进行武装叛乱，企图分裂祖国使西藏沦为殖民地和保护国。这个背叛祖国，破坏统一的武装叛乱，受到西藏广大僧俗人民和全国各族人民的坚决反对，已经遭到可耻的失败。我们上海工商业者坚决拥护政府采取的彻底粉碎反动分子叛乱活动的方针。使我们感到愤慨的是过去和我国同样遭受过帝国主义压迫并和我国共同创议和平共处五项原则的我们伟大的邻邦印度，竟有一批扩张主义分子发出一片干涉我国内政的叫嚣，和逃入印度的我国叛乱分子勾结，企图搞所谓西藏“独立”的把戏，想把西藏从我们祖国分裂出去。更使我们惊异的是本月十八日在印度提斯浦尔地方公开打出西藏“独立”旗帜的内容十分荒谬的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”竟是由印度的外交官员散发的。尼赫鲁总理说过“不允许在印度进行反对另一个国家的政治活动”，而这样一个公开攻击中国政府的政治性文件由印度外交官员散发，难道印度官方事先不知道吗？我们严正的告诉印度的扩张主义分子，西藏很久以来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这是全世界包括印度在内所公认的。我国平息叛乱的行动完全是中国的内政，站起来了的中国人民决不能容忍任何外国的干涉，帝国主义和外国反动势力分裂中国和摆布中国内政的时代早已一去不复返了。我们还要指出印度扩张主义分子干涉中国内政的活动是违背和平共处五项原则的，这必然是印度爱好和平的广大人民所反对的。现在西藏叛乱已经平息，西藏人民一定能够在中国共产党的领导下，和全国各族人民团结一致，摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，建设成为一个民主、繁荣、幸福的新西藏。这是任何人所阻挡不了的。
