Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1958 State Final Accounts and the 1959 Draft State Budget," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and I will resolutely implement them.

The Democratic Reform in the Yi and Tibetan agricultural areas of Sichuan has been completed. The slave system of the Yi people in Liangshan, Sichuan, and the feudal serfdom in the Tibetan agricultural areas have become things of the past.

The democratic reform in the Yi areas and Tibetan agricultural areas of Sichuan Province was fully completed in the years before last and last year respectively. The democratic reform in the Tibetan pastoral areas also began last autumn and is expected to be completed this year. In the reform, more than 600,000 slaves were liberated, more than 70% of the Tibetan and Yi people were allocated land, more than 10,000 ethnic minority cadres above the district level were trained, and a large number of Party and Youth League members were developed. Three regiments and one battalion of Tibetan and Yi public security forces and more than 160,000 militia were established; the grass-roots political power, completely managed by the Tibetan and Yi working people, is more consolidated and sound. Now we can say that the slave system of the Yi people in Liangshan, Sichuan, and the feudal serfdom in the Tibetan agricultural areas have become historical terms and will never return.

Following the victory of the democratic reform, we universally carried out socialist education and launched a mutual aid and cooperation movement. By the end of 1958, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture had basically achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization, and a portion of people's communes were experimentally established. In the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, more than 30% of peasant households had joined agricultural cooperatives, and basic cooperativization could also be achieved this year. On the above basis, the consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups has been greatly raised, and the enthusiasm for production is very high. A socialist national relationship of great unity, great cooperation, mutual learning, mutual support, common labor, and common development among the people of all ethnic groups has emerged. Inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Tibetan and Yi people have launched a high tide of great leap forward in production and construction. In 1958, grain production in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture increased by more than 100%, in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture by nearly 50%, and in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture by 19.2%. There has also been great development in industry, transportation, culture, education, and health. The Tibetan and Yi people of our province are advancing along the happy road of socialism and are rapidly changing the poverty and backwardness left over from history.

The above-mentioned victory of great historical significance did not come easily, especially in the Tibetan areas of Sichuan Province, because the upper-class reactionary elements launched an armed rebellion, and the rebellion was directly and indirectly planned and directed by imperialists, foreign reactionaries, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and Tibetan reactionaries. Therefore, it can be said that the victory of the democratic reform in the Tibetan areas of Sichuan, which is of great historical significance, was achieved through a very arduous and complex struggle.

In the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" issued by S. Sen, Joint Secretary of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs on April 18, it was nonsensically stated that "by the end of 1955, the struggle had already begun in the Kham region... Chinese armed forces destroyed many monasteries." The "Kham region" actually refers to the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture area of the former Xikang Province, which is now under the jurisdiction of Sichuan Province; the so-called "struggle" is actually the rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary elements of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. I must make a solemn statement and a serious rebuttal to this.

First of all, I must point out that the backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system in the Tibetan areas is a stumbling block hindering the progress of the Tibetan people and is incompatible with the continuous and significant victories of all ethnic groups in our country in the construction of the great motherland. It must be abolished and buried from our territory!

Before the reform, the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture was truly a hell on earth. The masses were not only subjected to extremely cruel economic exploitation, but also to extremely barbaric political rule.

Please allow me to talk about the situation of the feudal serf system in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province. Before the reform, the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province still retained the feudal serf system. The main means of production, such as land and pastures, were all owned by the serf owners. The serfs were bound to the land, and the serfs' personal freedom was also attached to the serf owners. This serf system was established on the basis of ruling and cruelly exploiting slaves. Serf owners were actually mostly Tusi headmen, and the Tusi headmen's "official residences" were both organizations of the feudal regime and operating agencies for extracting so-called taxes and issuing usurious loans for super-economic exploitation. Serfs had to cultivate land, perform services, pay taxes, and go on expeditions for the serf owners generation after generation without compensation. Therefore, most of the serfs' time and labor were used for cultivating and serving the serf owners, and only a small amount of time and strength were used for cultivation on their own small pieces of land. Serf owners also exploited the serfs' property through festivals, weddings, funerals, "eating up the industry," and creating disputes, especially usury, which was an important way for serf owners to cruelly exploit the serfs. Generally, it was lending two and repaying three, and some even lent one and repaid two; some serf owners only allowed paying interest and did not allow repayment of principal, binding the serfs to debt for generations. There was a kind of usury called "immortal cow" that could not be repaid for generations. Serfs who were forced to borrow this kind of cow had to pay a certain amount of butter every year, and even after the cow died, they still had to pay butter. Some serf owners also engaged in feudal commercial activities, forcing serfs to buy local products at low prices and sell various products at high prices, or even simply allocating or conscripting various local products without compensation. In addition, there were all kinds of extortions that were too numerous to mention. According to investigations, the amount of various exploitations by serf owners on serfs generally accounted for more than 70% of their annual income. The serfs could not bear the suffering, and many risked fleeing. Those who were fortunate enough to escape drifted to other places, begging for a living, or were caught by serf owners in other places and became serfs again.

In politics, the serf owners possessed a relatively complete system of extremely cruel ruling privileges. The Tusi were hereditary. Within their jurisdiction, the Tusi were the highest authority. Under the Tusi, there were several large headmen who were in charge of special privileges such as finance, justice, and military affairs. Below them, there were several small headmen who directly ruled the people. This was actually the political organization of the serf system. Relying on feudal privileges and feudal armed forces, courts, prisons, etc., they arbitrarily violated personal freedom, seized other people's wives and daughters, robbed other people's property, and put people to death. In addition to using torture instruments such as whips, shackles, handcuffs, iron chains, and wooden yokes to torture the people, they also had more than 100 kinds of extremely cruel and barbaric tortures such as gouging out eyes, cutting off noses, cutting off ears, cutting off lips, tearing out tongues, pulling tendons, branding with irons, nailing bamboo nails, chopping off hands, breaking feet, cutting open bellies, gouging out hearts, skinning, burying alive, throwing into rivers, putting into boiling oil, boiling in boiling water, chopping people into minced meat, burning red iron wires through people's heads, sewing people into wet cowhide bags and exposing them to the sun to death, hanging them on trees to starve to death and dry. Not long ago, we dug out the corpses of farmers who had been buried alive in the residences of some upper-class reactionary elements, dug out six human heads and severed hands and feet, and also found eight human skins (including the skin of a three-year-old child) and a human heart. The criminal rule of the feudal serf system has simply become a hell on earth!

The productive forces under the serf system were already very low. Coupled with the severe political oppression and economic exploitation, the people simply lived a life worse than cattle and horses. Therefore, events such as escape, resistance to rent, and resistance to debt occurred from time to time. In the years since liberation, the people's spontaneous struggles have increased day by day, and the demand for democratic reform is becoming increasingly urgent and universal. This shows that this backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system can no longer be maintained. Only by implementing democratic reform and abolishing the serf system can the Tibetan people move towards prosperity and development. This is the common demand of the broad masses of the Tibetan people. Before carrying out democratic reform, we fully consulted with representatives of the upper classes and obtained their agreement and approval.

In the reform, in addition to mainly solving the problem of changing the land ownership of the serf owners, great concessions were made in other aspects. However, a small number of extremely reactionary serf owners regarded our concessions as weakness and deception. They waved the banner of nationality and religion, created rumors, provoked national relations, obstructed and sabotaged democratic reform and socialist transformation, and frantically put forward reactionary slogans such as "Drive out the Han people and never reform," openly carrying out armed rebellion, coercing the masses to go to the mountains to become bandits, attacking government agencies, warehouses, and work teams, killing cadres, activists, and the masses, raping, plundering, and doing everything.

The so-called rebellion of the Khampa people was planned by the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet. After the failure of the rebellion, the rebels fled into the Tibetan region and were taken in by the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet.

These reactionary serf owner elements also used temples as the center for planning and organizing rebellions. Therefore, some temples were used as supply stations and intelligence stations for rebels, and some temples became the headquarters and command posts for rebellions. They used their feudal political privileges to force the masses to become bandits. For example, the upper-class rebel elements in Litang stipulated that all people between the ages of sixteen and sixty must follow them to participate in the rebellion, otherwise the whole family would be burned and killed; the upper-class rebel elements in Batang coerced the people to participate in the rebellion, stipulating that if they did not go for one day, they would be fined one horse, and if they did not go for two days, half of their property would be confiscated. In order to resist democratic reform, these reactionary serf owners used two pretexts to deceive the masses, one pretext called "protecting religion." Delegates! Please see how they "protect religion"! At the same time, the truth about the so-called destruction of temples in the democratic reform in the Kham region, as nonsensically stated in the Dalai Lama's statement, can be shattered. In fact, these upper-class rebel elements built fortifications and dug trenches on "sacred mountains," hid guns and ammunition in the bellies of Bodhisattvas, dug gun holes in the walls of temples, used scriptures as fortifications, used the temple's sacrificial drums, conches, and suonas as horns for rebellion, and used so-called sacred guns and sacred knives as weapons to kill the masses, and used the temple's scripture halls and Buddha halls as places for rebel leaders to plan and command rebellions. They also spread rumors everywhere, saying, "Killing a cadre is equivalent to building a scripture pagoda." May I ask: are these behaviors of "protecting religion" and "protecting temples"? The fact is already very clear. It is by no means the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army that destroy religious freedom and temples, but the rebels themselves. The People's Liberation Army and the People's Government have always adhered to the policy of religious freedom and vigorously protected temples from being destroyed. The rebels' shameless crimes of destroying temples in the rebellion cannot be tolerated by the broad masses of patriotic monks and lay people.

The other pretext used by the upper-class rebel elements to deceive the masses was called "protecting national interests," but they killed, set fires, raped, and plundered everywhere, and their hands were stained with the blood of the Tibetan people. According to incomplete statistics from Xinlong County in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, since the reform, 121 people have been killed by upper-class reactionary elements, and 138 people have been maimed for life by having their eyes gouged out, tendons pulled, noses cut off, and ears cut off. In the words of our Tibetan people, the rebellious crimes of the upper-class reactionary elements are "bigger than the sky, denser than the stars, longer than the river, and deeper than the sea!" The suffering of the Tibetan people is difficult to describe in words.

The armed rebellion launched by the reactionary serf owners in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture was quite rampant for a period in 1956. This was not only because they still controlled a large number of armed forces at that time, but also mainly due to the planning and command of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet under the instigation of imperialism and foreign reactionaries.

In 1955, for the benefit of their foreign masters and to obstruct the democratic reform in the Tibetan areas of our province, thereby maintaining the dark rule of the Tibetan serf owners, the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet dispatched Chijiang·Luosang Yixi and Chupugama Ba·Ribeduoji, taking advantage of the opportunity to accompany the Dalai Lama to the mainland, to the southern and northern counties of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture respectively. They committed crimes of plotting rebellion for a long time. These crimes of plotting rebellion were later completely evidenced from all aspects, including the mouths of those who were incited to rebel at the time. It was confirmed that the rebellion that occurred in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in early 1956, that is, the so-called rebellion of the Khampa people, was the direct result of the conspiracy and planning of Chijiang·Luosang Yixi and Chupugama Ba·Ribeduoji and others, upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet. When the rebellion failed, some of the remaining bandits fled into the Tibetan region, but the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet took them in and resupplied them with British-made guns and ammunition, and crossed the Jinsha River secretly, engaging in rebellions again and again, robbing, killing, and burning everywhere. The confessions of prisoners and various material evidences also confirmed that the backstage boss of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet was imperialism and foreign reactionaries. The upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet had already extended the claws of rebellion into the Tibetan areas of the neighboring province - Sichuan Province. It can be seen that these rebellious elements' conspiracy is really not small. However, the Tibetan people have stood up, they have cut off the claws of the Tibetan reactionary upper class that have stretched into the Tibetan areas of our province, and they will certainly be able to uproot the roots of these rebellious elements!

The Tibetan people must be liberated from the shackles of feudal serfdom. This is an inevitable trend of historical development, and no force can stop it.

The State Council's order to thoroughly quell the rebellion and dissolve the original Tibetan local government (Kasha), as well as Premier Zhou's statement in his report that "the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region should exercise the functions and powers of the local government so that Tibet can quickly achieve national regional autonomy and gradually carry out democratic reform" and other major measures, represent the interests of all ethnic groups happily living in the big family of the motherland, and express the urgent desire of the broad masses of the Tibetan people. I, on behalf of the 700,000 Tibetan people of Sichuan, express my warm support.

The whole world knows that Tibet is an indivisible part of the People's Republic of China, and the Tibetan people are members of the big family of our various ethnic groups. The so-called "Tibetan independence" of the Tibetan traitors is actually a synonym for splitting the motherland and siding with the imperialists. Guaranteeing the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups is our common and primary sacred task. I want to warn the Indian expansionists, please put away the tattered clothes you inherited from British imperialism! Your illusions will soon burst like soap bubbles. I want to warn the small handful of traitors in Tibet, what can you do? In addition to digging your own graves and burying yourselves quickly, you can't do anything.

History is constantly moving forward. The feudal serf system in the Tibetan areas has collapsed in Gansu, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Sichuan. The path taken by the Tibetan people in Gansu, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces is exactly the path that the Tibetan people will take. The Tibetan people must be liberated from the shackles of feudal serfdom. This is an inevitable trend of historical development, and no force can stop it.

The broad masses of patriotic monks and lay people in Tibet have closely united around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, actively cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to fight for the rapid and thorough quelling of the rebellion and for the construction of a democratic and socialist new Tibet. The Tibetan people of Sichuan Province will, together with the people of all ethnic groups across the country, contribute all their strength to safeguarding the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups, and to supporting the struggle of the Tibetan people.

Let the imperialists and Indian expansionists howl! Let some foreigners suddenly say that the three letters from the Dalai Lama to Tan Guansan are fake, and then have to admit that they are real! We Tibetan people will move from victory to victory along the road of democracy and socialism in the big family of the motherland!

专栏：

    印度扩张主义者的幻想会像肥皂泡一样的破灭
    桑吉悦希代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”及彭真副委员长“关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”，并坚决贯彻执行。
    四川彝族地区和藏族农业地区的民主改革已先后完成。四川凉山彝族的奴隶制度和藏族农业区的封建农奴制度已经一去不复返了
    四川省彝族地区和藏族农业地区的民主改革，已于前年和去年先后全部完成，藏族牧业区的民主改革亦已于去秋开始，预计今年内可以完成。在改革中，六十多万奴隶得到了解放，百分之七十以上的藏彝族人民分得了土地，培养了一万多名区级以上的民族干部，发展了大批党、团员；建立了三个团又一个营的藏、彝民族的公安部队和十六万多名民兵武装；完全由藏、彝族劳动人民当家作主的基层政权是更加巩固和健全起来了。现在我们可以这样说：四川凉山彝族的奴隶制度和藏族农业区的封建农奴制度已经变成了历史上的名词而一去不复返了。
    紧接着民主改革的胜利，我们普遍地进行了社会主义教育，开展了互助合作运动。截至一九五八年底，凉山彝族自治州和阿坝藏族自治州已经基本实现了高级农业合作化。并试办了一部分人民公社，甘孜藏族自治州加入农业合作社的农户已达百分之三十以上，今年内也可以基本合作化。在上述基础上，各族人民的觉悟大大提高，生产劲头很大，已经出现了各民族人民大团结、大协作、互相学习、互相支援、共同劳动、共同发展的社会主义的民族关系。在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，藏、彝族人民掀起了生产建设大跃进的高潮，一九五八年的粮食，凉山彝族自治州增产一倍以上，阿坝藏族自治州增产近百分之五十，甘孜藏族自治州增产百分之十九点二。工业、交通和文教卫生等方面也有很大的发展。我省藏、彝族人民正在沿着社会主义的幸福大道前进，正在迅速地改变着历史上遗留下来的贫困和落后状况。
    上述具有伟大历史意义的胜利，得来并不容易，特别是从我们四川藏族地区来说，因为上层反动分子发动了武装叛乱，而叛乱又是直接和间接在帝国主义、外国反动派、蒋介石匪帮和西藏反动派的策划和指挥之下进行的。所以说具有伟大历史意义的四川藏族地区民主改革的胜利，它是经过了非常艰巨、复杂的斗争而取得的。
    四月十八日经由印度外交部联合秘书斯·森散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中胡说“到一九五五年年底，斗争已经在康省开始了，……中国武装部队摧毁了许多寺院”。所说的“康省”实际上是指的原西康省现在已划归四川省管辖的甘孜藏族自治州地区；所谓“斗争”实际上就是甘孜藏族自治州上层反动分子所发动的叛乱。对此，我必须作郑重的说明和严正的驳斥。
    我首先要指出，藏族地区落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度是阻碍藏族人民前进的绊脚石，与我们全国各民族在伟大祖国建设中不断获得重大胜利的情况是不相适应的，必须予以废除，必须从我们的领土上把它埋葬掉！
    改革以前的甘孜藏族自治州，是真正的人间地狱，群众不但在经济上受着极残酷的剥削，在政治上也受着极野蛮的统治
    请允许我在这里谈一谈四川省甘孜藏族自治州的封建农奴制度的情况。四川省甘孜藏族自治州在改革以前还保存着封建农奴制度，主要的生产资料，如土地、牧场等都为农奴主所有。农奴被束缚在土地上，农奴的人身也依附于农奴主。这种农奴制度是在统治和残酷剥削奴隶的基础上建立起来的。农奴主实际又多系土司头人，而土司头人的“官寨”，既是封建政权的组织，又是榨取所谓税款和发放高利贷超经济剥削行为的办事机关。农奴必须世世代代为农奴主无代价地种地、服役、纳税、出征。因之，农奴们的大部分时间和大部分的劳力是为农奴主耕种和服役，只有很少的时间和力量在自己小块土地上耕作。农奴主还通过年节、婚丧、“吃绝业”和制造纠纷等来搜刮农奴们的财产，特别是高利贷，更是农奴主残酷剥削农奴的重要方式，一般是借二还三，甚至有的是借一还二；有些农奴主只准付利不许还本，世世代代把农奴束缚在债务上。在高利贷中有一种叫做“不死牛”的就是世世代代还不清的，被强迫贷放了这种牛的农奴每年要交纳一定数量的酥油，牛死后照交酥油。有些农奴主还兼营封建性商业，向农奴强迫低价收购土特产和高价推销各种产品，甚至干脆无偿摊派或强征各种土特产，此外，还有各种各样的敲诈勒索是举不胜举的。据调查，农奴主对农奴的各种剥削量，一般在年收入的百分之七十以上，农奴不堪其苦，有不少的冒险逃亡，有幸而逃出的，就流落外乡，乞讨度日，或者又被外乡的农奴主抓去当了农奴。
    在政治上，农奴主拥有一套比较完整的极端残酷的统治特权制度。土司是世袭的。土司在其所辖的范围内，是最高的权威者，土司之下，有若干大头人，分掌财政、司法、军事等特权，下面还有若干小头人直接统治人民，这实际就是农奴制的政权组织。他们凭借着封建特权和封建武装、法庭、监狱等，任意侵犯人身自由，霸占人家妻女，强夺人家财产，处死人命；他们除用皮鞭、脚镣、手铐、铁链、木枷等刑具摧残人民外，还有挖眼睛、割鼻子、割耳朵、割嘴唇、扒舌头、抽脚筋、烙铁烙、钉竹钉、砍手、断脚、剖腹、剜心、剥皮、活埋、丢河、下油锅、开水煮、把人剁成肉酱、烧红铁丝穿人头、把人缝在湿牛皮包里曝晒致死、吊在树上饿死风干等等极端残酷野蛮的刑法不下一百余种。不久以前，我们在某些上层反动分子的住所挖出活埋了的农民尸首，挖出六个人头和被砍断的手、脚，还搜出八张人皮（其中有三岁小孩的人皮）和一颗人心。封建农奴制度的罪恶统治，简直成了人间地狱！
    农奴制度下的生产力，本来就是十分低的，加以惨重的政治压迫和经济剥削，人民简直过着牛马不如的生活。所以，逃亡、抗租、抗债等事件时有发生。解放几年来，人民自发性的斗争日益增多，对于民主改革的要求，是日益迫切普遍的。说明这种落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度已经不可能继续维持下去了，只有实行民主改革，废除农奴制度，藏族人民才有可能走向繁荣和发展。这是广大藏族人民的共同要求。在进行民主改革之前，我们同上层代表人士进行过充分协商，取得了他们同意和赞成。
    在改革中，除了主要解决改变农奴主的土地占有制以外，其它方面都作了很大的让步。但是，少数极端反动的农奴主们，竟把我们的让步认为是软弱可欺。他们打着民族和宗教旗帜，制造谣言，挑拨民族关系，阻挠与破坏民主改革和社会主义改造，猖狂地提出“赶走汉人，永不改革”等反动口号，公开进行武装叛乱，并胁迫群众上山为匪，袭击政府机关、仓库和工作队，残杀干部、积极分子和群众，奸淫掳掠，无所不为。
    所谓康巴人的叛乱，就是西藏上层反动分子一手策划的，叛乱失败以后，叛乱分子又逃入西藏地区，被西藏上层反动分子收容起来
    这些反动的农奴主分子，还利用寺庙作为策划和组织叛乱的中心，因此，有些寺庙被利用为叛匪的补给站和情报站，有些寺庙则变成了叛乱的参谋部和司令部。他们利用其封建政治特权强迫群众为匪，例如理塘的上层叛乱分子曾规定：凡年满十六岁到六十岁的人都要跟随他们参加叛乱，否则烧杀全家；巴塘的上层叛乱分子胁迫人民参加叛乱，规定一天不去罚马一匹，两天不去没收一半家产。这些反动农奴主为了抵抗民主改革，用来欺骗群众的有两个幌子，一个幌子叫着什么“保护宗教”，代表们！请看他们是如何“保护宗教”吧！同时也就可以粉碎所谓达赖喇嘛的声明中，胡说什么在康省进行民主改革中，所谓对于寺庙的破坏的真实情况了。实际是这些上层叛乱分子在“神山”上筑工事、挖战壕，在菩萨肚子里藏枪弹，在寺庙围墙上挖枪眼，还把经书拿来作工事，把寺庙敬神的法鼓、海螺、琐呐等用作叛乱的号角，把所谓神枪、神刀作为屠杀群众的凶器，把寺庙的经堂、佛殿当作匪首策划和指挥叛乱的场所。他们还到处宣传说：“杀死一个干部，等于造一座经塔”。试问：这些就是“保护宗教”“保护寺庙”的行为吗？事实已经非常明白了，破坏宗教信仰自由和破坏寺庙的，绝不是人民政府和人民解放军，而是叛乱分子自己，人民解放军和人民政府是始终坚持宗教信仰政策和用大力保护寺庙不致遭受破坏的。叛乱分子在叛乱中无耻破坏寺庙的罪行，是为广大的爱国僧俗人民绝不能容忍的。
    上层叛乱分子用来欺骗群众的另一个幌子叫着“保护民族利益”，但是，他们却到处杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，双手沾满了藏族人民的鲜血。据甘孜藏族自治州新龙县不完全的统计，改革以来被上层反动分子杀害的群众达一百二十一人，被挖眼睛、抽脚筋、割鼻子、割耳朵等而致终身残废的有一百三十八人。用我们藏族人民的话来说，上层反动分子的叛乱罪恶是“比天大、比星密、比河长、比海深！”藏族人民受害之惨，是难以用言语形容的。
    反动的农奴主在甘孜藏族自治州发动的武装叛乱，在一九五六年中，曾经有一个时期相当嚣张，这不单是他们当时还掌握着大批武装，更主要的还是由于在帝国主义和外国反动派指使下的西藏上层反动集团的策划和指挥。
    一九五五年西藏上层反动集团为了他们外国主子的利益和为了阻挠我省藏区进行民主改革，从而维护西藏农奴主的黑暗统治，派遣赤江·罗桑益西、楚普噶玛巴·日贝多吉，乘随同达赖喇嘛来内地的机会，分别到了甘孜藏族自治州的南路各县和北路各县，他们分别进行了长时期策划叛乱的罪行。这些策划叛乱的罪行，后来从各方面包括当时被煽动叛乱的人的口中得到了完全的证据，证实了甘孜藏族自治州在一九五六年初发生的叛乱，即是所谓康巴人的叛乱，正是西藏上层反动分子赤江·罗桑益西和楚普噶玛巴·日贝多吉等人阴谋策划的直接结果。当叛乱失败后，一部分残余叛匪逃入了西藏地区，而西藏上层反动分子却把他们收容起来，并重新供给他们以英国制造的枪弹，又偷越金沙江，一次再次的进行叛乱，到处抢劫、烧杀，俘虏的口供和种种物证，还确凿地证实了西藏上层反动集团的后台老板是帝国主义和外国反动派。西藏上层反动集团早已把叛乱的魔手伸入到邻省——四川省的藏族地区来了，可见这些叛乱分子的阴谋真不小。但是，藏族人民已经站起来了，他们已经把西藏反动上层伸入我省藏区的魔手斩掉了，而且他们也一定能把这个叛乱分子的根子拔掉！
    西藏人民一定要从封建农奴制的枷锁中解放出来，这是历史发展的必然趋势，任何力量也阻挡不了
    国务院命令彻底平息叛乱和解散原西藏地方政府（噶厦），以及周总理在报告中说“由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，使西藏迅速实现民族地方自治和逐步进行民主改革”等等重大措施，代表了幸福地生活在祖国大家庭里的各族人民的利益，道出了广大藏族人民的迫切愿望，我代表四川七十万藏族人民表示热烈的拥护。
    全世界都知道，西藏是中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分，藏族是我们各民族祖国大家庭中的一员。西藏叛国分子的所谓“西藏独立”实际上就是分裂祖国，投靠帝国主义者的代名词。保证祖国统一和各民族团结，是我们各族人民共同的、首要的神圣任务。我要警告印度的扩张主义分子，请把你们在英帝国主义那里继承来的破烂的衣钵收起来吧！你们的幻想只不过像肥皂泡一样很快就会破灭的。我要警告西藏的一小撮叛国分子，你们能做什么呢？除了自掘坟墓，很快埋葬你们自己之外，是不能有什么作为的。
    历史在不断的向前发展，藏族地区的封建农奴制度已经在甘肃、青海、云南、四川崩溃了。甘肃、青海、云南、四川等省藏族人民走的道路，正是西藏人民将要走的道路。西藏人民一定要从封建农奴制度的枷锁中解放出来。这是历史发展的必然趋势，是任何力量也阻挡不了的。
    西藏广大的爱国僧俗人民已经紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，积极地协同人民解放军部队，为迅速地、彻底地平息叛乱，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。我们四川省的藏族人民将和全国各民族人民一道，为维护祖国统一和各民族的团结，为支援西藏人民的斗争贡献出一切力量。
    让帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子去嚎叫吧！让有些外国人忽而说达赖喇嘛给谭冠三的三封信是假的，忽而又不得不承认是真的吧！我们藏族人民将在祖国的大家庭中，沿着民主和社会主义的道路，从胜利走向胜利！
