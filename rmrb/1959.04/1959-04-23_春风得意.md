    Riding on the Spring Breeze
    Feng Jiannan
    I left the fort and headed towards the grain processing plant and hydroelectric power station, following the direction pointed out by Old Yang, the Party General Branch Secretary of the management area.
    It was spring, and new green had painted the wild grass and willow branches. Coupled with the clear, sandstorm-free weather, and the beautiful scenery of the place, nestled against the mountains and beside the water, I felt joyful and quickly walked up the hillside. Looking west, I saw several large trees about half a kilometer away, covering several adobe houses, beautifully resembling a landscape painting. Even more interesting was the red object hanging high, high above the adobe houses – was it a flag? A kite? Or a wine curtain? It hung so high, rolling in the spring breeze, beckoning me to hurry forward.
    As I approached the adobe houses, I saw a sign hanging at the entrance: Grain Processing Plant. Looking up, I saw that fluttering above the roof and in mid-air was actually a "Superiority Red Flag." How unique, I had never seen a brocade flag hung like this! I walked in. I saw the whole room was full of grinding discs, wooden pillars and belts rotating. Indeed, just as Old Yang had told me, adding grain, grinding flour, sifting, and bagging were all automated and mechanized. Several old men were looking after the machines. The belts and grinding discs moved rapidly, singing loudly, while the old men, on the contrary, worked very leisurely and peacefully.
    After watching for a while, a man who looked old but had bright eyes walked in. As soon as he saw me, he introduced himself as Wang Hancheng. It seemed that Old Yang had mentioned me to him. I knew that Wang Hancheng was the factory director, a Communist Party member.
    Comrade Old Wang led me to see how the grain was being processed. He pointed out every detail to me and gave me necessary explanations. When he opened the door of the wooden hopper supported between two hollow wooden pillars, letting me see clearly the flour sifting operation inside, he suddenly disregarded everything else, led me to the corner of the west wall, pointed to the wooden planks embedded in the ground and said: "Here, there used to be a set of wooden frames. For sifting flour, people would step on it, step on it, and I did this job for twenty years - even in the freezing cold, I would be covered in sweat!"
    After this, he led me out of the back door, walked along the outside of the west wall, and down the stone steps. At the end of the stone steps was a stone wall, and a small door was tightly blocked by several layers of thick straw mats. He moved the straw mats one by one, letting me look inside: Ah, power, this is the power, flowing water was hitting the wheel and spinning with splashing waves...
    Old Wang still blocked the small door tightly. We walked up the stone steps, not entering the house, but walking along the canal. After walking for twenty or thirty feet, there was a small bridge across the canal. We stood at the head of the bridge, watching the brocade flag flying high. Suddenly, I heard Old Wang say loudly:
    "Ha, ha, it's getting warmer, the ice is thawing!"
    He spoke so loudly that I was slightly surprised. Because he had been speaking to me in a low voice, he was clearly a calm person who didn't easily show his emotions. This sentence was a bit strange. I felt that this sentence was not just for me. It was for me, for himself, and for spring.
    But he quickly calmed down again. He faced me again and spoke in a low voice.
    "This morning, I climbed onto the roof and pulled the red flag we won in the year-end evaluation as high as possible, letting it fly in the wind. We don't have a house for office meetings here, no place to hang it. Hanging it out, it's also good for the people in the production team to see our leaping progress this year!
    "This canal water is drawn from the Yang River and the Old Crow River. I serve it in winter and summer, it's very hard work! In the coldest days of winter, the water in the canal freezes. You have to break the ice and push it away so that the water flows down. If the ice freezes too much, too thick, you have to go into the water to break the ice - look, my cotton clothes..."
    His cotton clothes and cotton trousers had obviously been soaked in water countless times, turning yellow with many water stains.
    "In the summer, when mountain floods occur, the Yang River rises, the canal is full of water, and if it overflows, it will damage the land. I have to go into the water to manage the water blocking and releasing gates.
    "My wife quarrels with me, she says, don't do this anymore, someone should come and replace you. I ignore her. If a Communist Party member doesn't do this job, who will? She just keeps talking about it all day long. Her awareness is not high enough, but you can't blame her too much. A family of seven relies on me to earn enough food, and the commune has to find ways to help every year; she doesn't earn many work points, it's difficult for her to go to the fields, there are no elderly people at home, who will take care of the children? She gets anxious and says, tell the eldest son not to go to school anymore, go to the fields, and earn some work points; the second is a daughter, she says, don't let her study either, bring her back to take care of the younger ones, so I can be free to go to the fields. I don't agree. I criticize her for her short-sightedness - I, this old illiterate, just finished sweeping away illiteracy, and you want to create new little illiterates? We are in the midst of a great cultural and technological revolution, and you bring this up? In the end, she still says the same thing: you should switch jobs with someone else.
    "Unexpectedly, the technological revolution has spread to this mill. Last April, Old Liu came here to be the township Party secretary (he transferred from the army, now he is the deputy director of the commune). He walked into this room and said, it's too hard for you to do this work, and it's not very productive, you have to find a way to innovate! He took the train to Zhangjiakou overnight to find his chief of staff (Old Liu was a battalion commander in the People's Liberation Army), the chief of staff also transferred with him and worked in a flour mill. In that flour mill there were electric mills, Old Liu pointed to the electric mill and said to Old Hu (the chief of staff's surname is Hu): come down to the countryside with me to transform the water mill! You have automation here, why shouldn't I have automation there? The battalion commander and chief of staff came and laid out blueprints, mobilized manpower, directed the battle, and in a few days, automation was achieved, and ten or so young and middle-aged laborers were freed up to go to the fields. I was also freed up from the wooden frames, and I can consider more business management. However, all the good laborers were transferred away, and the ones who came were all old men, in winter, breaking the ice and going into the water, I can't rely on them, I have to do it myself, fortunately I am used to it...
    "As soon as the People's Commune was established, canteens and kindergartens were set up, and the children were taken care of! My wife came back from the fields, brought the five children, sat down in the canteen, rolled up her sleeves, served rice and dishes, and ate with her mouth open! She was satisfied and no longer quarreled with me. She came from a suffering background, only thirty-six years old, there is no work in the fields that she can't do! She always has a smile on her face, goes to the fields and sings! I feel happy in my heart, and I say to her: this is good, you are liberated from the three hearths, but I am still turning with the millstone! But I am willing! You can rest assured and work hard!..."
    Old Wang's words were so calm and peaceful, but I heard the excitement in his heart. His words and his expression were like the flowing water in the canal in front of him, his heart and his thoughts were like the power generated at the end of the flowing water. The water in the canal seemed to have no rhythm, no waves, but just twenty or thirty feet away, the canal water cascaded down, making a rumbling sound and generating huge power, driving the wheels, grinding discs, and belts to spin rapidly...
    At this moment, two people came out of the mill: Old Yang, the Party General Branch Secretary of the management area, and Old Liu, the Deputy Director of the Commune. As soon as Old Liu saw Old Wang, he shouted: "Good news! Good news! Come, let's go to the power station and study it!" I followed them across the bridge, turned a corner, and walked into the power station. Old Liu put a paper roll on the kang, opened it, and it turned out to be the "East Wind People's Commune Construction Plan," a very finely and clearly printed blueprint. He pointed with his finger and said: "Look, from east to west, passing through your place, our commune is going to open such a clear water river, next to the clear water river, we are going to build twelve power stations - the power station and grain processing plant here will all be expanded...construction is about to begin. Once the clear water river is opened, it will be connected to the Yang River, and it will be able to irrigate 20,000 mu of paddy fields. Old Wang, relying only on this canal, it won't be a big deal, do you agree?"
    Old Wang did not answer - no, he answered, because he smiled, smiled with a face full of spring breeze. I felt the spring breeze outside the window and the spring breeze inside the house were convecting, making people feel particularly comfortable. Suddenly looking up, I saw outside the skylight, the Superiority Red Flag was laughing happily, rolling in the spring breeze, playing with the blue sky and white clouds, and beckoning for new victories.

    春风得意
    冯健男
    我出了堡子，按照管理区党总支书记老杨指的方向，朝粮食加工厂和水力发电站走去。
    春天了，野草上、柳条上染上了新绿，加上这天天气晴朗，没有风砂，这个地方又很美，依山傍水，我心中欢喜，很快就走上山坡。向西一望，只见前面一里地外，几棵大树，覆盖着几间土屋，优美得像是一幅风景画，更有趣的，是土屋之上，高高地、高高地挂起一面红色的——是旗帜？是风筝？还是酒帘？它挂得那么高，在春风里翻卷，招引着我快快前去。
    我走近土屋，只见门口挂着牌子：粮食加工厂；抬头一望，屋顶上、半空中飘扬着的，原来是一面“优胜红旗”。真别致，未曾见过这样张挂锦旗的！我走了进去。只见满屋的磨盘、木柱和皮带在旋转。真的，正像老杨告诉我的，添粮、磨面、过筛、装袋，完全自动化、机械化了。几个老人在照管着机器。皮带和磨盘疾速地运动着，大声地歌唱着，而老人们则相反，他们工作得很悠闲，很安详。
    我看了一会儿，一个看来苍老、但两眼有神的人走了进来，一见了我，自己介绍说他是王汉诚。看来，是老杨对他提起过我了。我知道，王汉诚就是厂长，共产党员。
    老王同志领我观看粮食在怎样加工。他指给我看每一个细节，对我作必要的解说。当他打开支在两个空心木柱之间的木斗的门，让我看清那里面在进行着罗面的操作之后，忽然不顾其它，把我领到西面的墙角，指着地上嵌着的木板说道：“在这里，原来有一套木架子，为了罗面，人们在上面蹬呀，蹬呀，我就干了二十年这个活——哪怕天寒地冻，也累得满身大汗！”
    在这以后，他领着我走出了后门，挨着西墙外边，走下石阶。石阶的尽头有一道石墙，一个小门被好几层厚厚的草席堵得严严的；他把草席一张一张挪开，让我朝里看：呵，动力，这就是动力，流水在冲击着轮子带着浪花飞旋……
    老王照旧把那小门堵严。我们走上石阶，不进屋，却沿着渠道走。走了两三丈远，有一座小桥横跨渠上。我们站在桥头，眼看着那面锦旗在高处飞舞。忽听得老王高声说：
    “哈，哈，天暖和啦，解冻啦！”
    他这样大声说话，叫我微微吃惊。因为，他一直是低声地在跟我说话的，他显然是一个沉静的、情绪不易外露的人。这句话说得有些异样。我感到，这句话不只是对我说的。是对我，对他自己，并且对春天说的。
    但他很快又平静下来。他又面对着我低声说话了。
    “今天早晨，我爬上屋顶，把我们年终评奖得的红旗扯得高高的，让它迎风飘。我们这儿又没个办公开会的屋子，没个地方好挂。挂出去，也好让生产队的人们瞧瞧我们今年的跃进劲头儿！
    “这渠水，是从洋河和老鸦河引来的。冬天和夏天，我伺候它，可辛苦啦！在数九寒天，渠里水要结冰。得把冰块打破、排开，让水流下去。冰结多了，结厚了，得下水打冰——你看，我这身棉衣……”
    他的棉衣、棉裤，显然是在水里浸过多少次的，发黄，有许多水迹。
    “夏天呢，发了山洪，洋河水涨，渠里水满，溢出去，就会冲坏了地。我得下水管住那拦水放水的闸。
    “我的老婆跟我吵，她说，别再干这个啦，也该有人来跟你换换班啦。我不理她。这个活，我共产党员不干，谁干？她呀，就整天在你身边说个没完。她觉悟不够高，可也不能多责怪她。一家七口，靠我挣不够吃粮，年年得社里想办法；她挣分不多，下地有困难，家里没个老人，谁照看小孩？她急了，就说，叫大小子别念书啦，下地去，多少也挣点分；二的是闺女，她说，也别念啦，拉回来照看小的，腾出我来好下地。我不同意。我批评她见识短——我这老文盲刚扫完，又让长出小文盲来？正在大闹文化革命技术革命，你提这个？临了，她还是那句话：你跟人换个活干吧。
    “想不到技术革命一闹就闹到这个磨坊里来。去年4月，老刘到这里来当乡党委书记（他从部队转业来这儿的，现在是公社副主任）。他走进这屋里一看，就说，你们这活干得多费劲，又不出活，得想办法革新呀！他连夜坐火车上张家口去找他的参谋长（老刘在解放军是营长），参谋长跟他一块转业，在面粉厂工作。那面粉厂里有电磨，老刘指着电磨对老胡（参谋长姓胡）说：快跟我下乡改造水磨去！你这儿自动化，我那儿就不要自动化？营长参谋长一来，摆开图样，调动人力，指挥打仗，几天工夫，就自动化了，十来个青壮年劳力都从这儿腾出来，下了地了。我也从木架子上腾出来，可以多考虑点经营管理了。不过，好劳动力都调走了，换来的都是老汉，冬天打冰，下水，可不能靠他们，得我一人干，好在我是惯了的……
    “人民公社一成立，办了食堂幼儿园，孩子有人照看了！我那老婆从地里回来，带了大小五个小孩，往食堂里一坐，卷起袖子，盛了饭菜，张口就吃！她心满意足，再不跟我吵了。她受苦人出身，才三十六岁，地里的活，哪一样不会干？成天露着个笑脸，下地干活，还唱歌哩！我心里一乐，对她说：这倒好，你从三台里解放出来了，可我哩，还是伴着磨台转！可我甘心情愿！你就放心大胆地好好干活吧！……”
    老王的这一席话，说得那么平静，安详，但是，我听出了他心头的激动。他的话、他的表情就像眼前渠中的流水，他的心、他的思想却像这流水尽头处所发生的动力。渠中流水看来没有节奏，没有波澜，但是，就在那两三丈以外的地方，渠水跌荡奔泻而下，发出轰轰的响声和巨大的力量，推动着轮子、磨盘、皮带天旋地转……
    正在这时，从磨坊走出两个人来：管理区党总支书记老杨、公社副主任老刘。老刘一见了老王，就喊：“好消息！好消息！来，咱们到发电站研究研究！”我随着他们过了桥，拐个弯，走进发电站。老刘把一个纸卷放在炕上，摊开一看，原来是“东风人民公社建设规划图”，印得非常精细清晰的蓝图。他用手指点着说：“瞧，从东往西，经过你们这儿，我们公社要开这样一条清水河，清水河旁边，要修十二个发电站，——你们这儿的发电站和粮食加工厂，都要扩建……就要动工了。清水河一开成，跟洋河串通起来，就能灌溉两万亩水稻。老王，光靠这道渠，是成不了大气候的，你说是吗？”
    老王没有回答——不，他回答了，因为他笑了，笑得满面春风。我感到窗外的春风和屋里的春风在对流，使人特别舒畅。猛抬头，只见天窗外边，那面优胜红旗正在欢笑着，翻卷着春风，嬉弄着蓝天白云，招唤着新的胜利。
