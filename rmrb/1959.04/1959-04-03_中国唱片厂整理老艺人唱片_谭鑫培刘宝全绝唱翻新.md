    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. The Shanghai China Record Factory is currently organizing and replicating some of the recordings of the deceased famous Peking Opera actors Tan Xinpei, Liu Hongsheng, and Liu Baoquan, who was famous for Jingyun Dagu, and more than ten other people. These records include Tan Xinpei's "Si Lang Visits His Mother," Liu Hongsheng's "Beheading Huangpao," "Zha Mei'an," Liu Baoquan's "The Grand West Chamber," "Wulongyuan," Jin Shaoshan's "Stealing the Horse," "Mu Hu Crying Qin," and others.
    Tan Xinpei, Liu Hongsheng, and other famous old Peking Opera artists have mostly passed away twenty or thirty years ago, and their records have also been out of print for more than twenty years. Some records cannot be found from the existing old record templates. Some of the old films used by the China Record Factory for replication were borrowed from some collectors after sending people to search for them everywhere.
    Due to the poor record production conditions decades ago, a record could only be played for five or six minutes, and there was a lot of noise. In the replication process, the China Record Factory not only tried to eliminate noise and improve sound quality, but also combined the original several records into one.
    The China Record Factory has also recently successfully trial-produced a new type of microgroove record that can be rolled up for storage—the art record. This art record is made by pressing a smooth, transparent plastic film and a colorful art card. The colorful pictures on the art card are the content of the record's song. This record factory has also successfully trial-produced two types of microgroove records with speeds of 16 and two-thirds revolutions per minute and 45 revolutions per minute, and one record can be played for more than an hour and a half.

    中国唱片厂整理老艺人唱片
    谭鑫培刘宝全绝唱翻新
    新华社上海2日电　已故著名京剧演员谭鑫培、刘鸿声和以京韵大鼓闻名的刘宝全等十多人的一部分录音唱片，现在正由上海中国唱片厂陆续整理和复制。这些唱片包括谭鑫培的“四郎探母”，刘鸿声的“斩黄袍”、“铡美案”，刘宝全的“大西厢”、“乌龙院”，金少山的“盗马”、“牧虎哭秦”等。
    谭鑫培、刘鸿声等著名京剧老艺人大都已逝世二、三十年，他们的唱片也都绝版二十多年了，有些唱片从现有的旧唱片模版中已无法找到，中国唱片厂用来复制的一部分旧片，是派人四出向一些收藏家探寻、借到的。
    由于几十年前唱片制作条件较差，一张唱片往往只能放唱五、六分钟，而且杂音很多，中国唱片厂在复制过程中，不仅设法剔除杂音，提高音质，而且把原来几张唱片合为一张。
    中国唱片厂最近还试制成功了一种可以卷起来存放的新密纹唱片——美术唱片。这种美术唱片由一种润滑透明的塑料薄膜和一张彩色的美术卡压制而成。美术卡上的五彩图画，就是唱片歌唱的内容。这个唱片厂还试制成功了每分钟转十六又三分之二圈和四十五圈的两种密纹唱片，一张唱片可以放唱到一个半小时以上。
