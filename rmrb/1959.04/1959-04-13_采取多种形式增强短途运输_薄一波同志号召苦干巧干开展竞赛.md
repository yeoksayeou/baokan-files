Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Comrade Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke at an expanded national teleconference on transportation convened by the Ministry of Communications. The full text is as follows:
    Comrades, all staff and workers on the transportation front!
    The teleconference convened by the Ministry of Communications calls on everyone to launch a vigorous red flag competition movement on the transportation front to strengthen the work on the transportation front to ensure the completion of the 1959 national economic plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. A few days ago, the Ministry of Railways held a mobilization meeting for the red flag competition on the railway front, and this movement has already been launched on the railways. All staff and workers on the transportation front will certainly not lag behind and will certainly launch this movement shoulder to shoulder with your brothers on the railways, supporting and promoting each other to make this movement even better. Now, I will say a few words to you.
    Last year, you have already achieved great results in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. Thanks to the strengthening of the leadership of the Party committees at all levels over the transportation industry, the implementation of the policy of taking steel as the key link and a comprehensive leap forward, and overcoming many difficulties in transportation work, we have ensured the completion of various transportation tasks centered on 10.07 million tons of steel. The total volume of cargo transportation completed by water, land, and air throughout the year increased by more than double compared to 1957. Many advanced experiences have been created, and many inspiring and admirable deeds have emerged. You have played an extremely important role in promoting the overall Great Leap Forward of the national economy. Here, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend warm congratulations to all staff and workers on the transportation front!
    This year, China's socialist construction will continue to leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. Recently, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party discussed and approved the draft national economic plan for 1959. This draft plan was prepared based on the four major indicators of 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 1050 billion jin of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the production and capital construction situation in the first quarter of this year. The preparation of this draft plan has given serious consideration to both the objective possibility of China's material and technical conditions and the subjective initiative of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people. This is a magnificent plan that can realize the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy. This draft plan will be submitted by the State Council to the First Session of the Second National People's Congress for deliberation. The Central Committee of our Party firmly believes that under the glorious illumination of the general line of socialist construction, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Chinese people will continue to exert their efforts, continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and ingenious work, give full play to the potential strength of all aspects, and launch a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy. We will certainly be able to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan. The 1959 national economic plan brings even more arduous tasks to the transportation sector, requiring all staff and workers on the national transportation front to make greater efforts and achieve better results. From the perspective of the total volume of cargo transportation by waterways, highways, and airlines across the country this year, you are undertaking a great task. This is a plan for continued Great Leap Forward. To complete this plan, all aspects of water transport, land transport, and air transport must simultaneously grasp both the completion of current transportation tasks and the task of doing a good job in capital construction, and they must be done well. In particular, the current transportation tasks must be done well. In terms of local transportation, both long-distance transportation and short-distance transportation must be well grasped. Currently, special attention must be paid to short-distance transportation, which should be combined with the use of various transportation equipment and the role of various transportation tools should be brought into play. Not only should the transportation departments and all aspects cooperate and collaborate in an all-round way, but also all relevant departments of the national economy should cooperate and collaborate in an all-round way. Everyone should do a good job in transportation, especially short-distance transportation. On the transportation front, short-distance transportation plays an important role. This year, there are some difficulties in completing the greatly increased transportation tasks for the transportation sector, but these difficulties can be overcome through everyone's efforts. I fully agree with the requirements put forward by the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Communications to everyone. As long as we rely on everyone's enthusiasm and creativity, make a big technical revolution, launch a red flag competition for socialist construction on all fronts of national transportation, continue to exert our efforts, strive for the top, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and set off a new upsurge in production and construction, certain difficulties existing in front of us will certainly be overcome by us, and this year's transportation tasks will certainly be successfully completed.
    In the current transportation work, all regions must attach great importance to short-distance transportation. I have already said above that short-distance transportation is currently the weakest link. As everyone knows, since the realization of people's communes in rural areas, production has developed rapidly, and the amount of cargo transportation has increased a lot, but the increase in cars and ships is not enough to meet the needs of transportation tasks. What method should be used to solve this problem? It is necessary to use a large number of various types of civilian transportation tools. The provincial, municipal, prefectural, and county party committees of our party must strengthen their leadership over short-distance transportation. Because the collection and distribution of materials in rural areas and small towns mainly rely on people's communes and production teams. It is necessary to appropriately arrange the labor force necessary for short-distance transportation so that short-distance transportation has a fixed professional transportation team, as well as a sideline transportation team. For these personnel, it is necessary to implement the socialist principle of distribution according to work, that is, the principle of more work, more pay, and determine their labor remuneration. This remuneration can take the form of a basic wage system plus a bonus system, or the method of work evaluation and point recording, to give full play to the enthusiasm of people's communes in running transportation, especially production teams in running transportation. At the same time, in short-distance transportation, it is also necessary to gradually change the mode of transportation by carrying on shoulders and backs, and vigorously engage in technical revolution. According to the principles of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, we will continue to vigorously promote vehicleization, railization, cablewayization, and chuteization, adopt various methods to enhance the capacity of short-distance transportation, and gradually improve the technical level of transportation tools to save labor. At present, people's communes in various places have accumulated a lot of experience in running transportation, and this requires summarizing and exchanging good experiences for promotion. Only in this way can it be conducive to the overall Great Leap Forward of the national economy, conducive to industrial and agricultural production, conducive to the diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery of people's communes, and also conducive to increasing the income of commune members. We require people's communes in various places to launch a red flag competition for socialism in short-distance transportation, and conduct competitions between each county, each commune, and each team to see who runs short-distance transportation well! Comrades, I cannot explain the importance of short-distance transportation one by one in this place. In short, in our country where transportation is not very developed, modern transportation, railway or automobile transportation, air transportation, should be carried out simultaneously with our handicrafts, handcarts, wooden boats, wooden sailboats, etc., and the method of walking on two legs should also be implemented. And today, it is of particular importance to use these old-fashioned transportation tools for transportation in short-distance transportation.
    In addition, all aspects of the transportation front should pay attention to improving labor productivity, continue to carry forward the communist spirit, break superstitions, liberate their minds, and create new achievements.
    We require water transportation to give full play to the power of existing ships and wooden sailboats, make full use of water transportation, strengthen ship turnover, improve port loading and unloading efficiency, expand port throughput capacity, actively manage waterways, extend navigable mileage, improve ship repair quality, and speed up ship repair time. This is the requirement for water transportation.
    We require highway transportation to promote trailer transportation, do a good job in maintenance and repair, save fuel and accessories, and do a good job in road construction and maintenance so that the strength of automobile transportation can play a greater role on highway trunk lines. Actively improve civilian transportation tools, give full play to the use of hundreds of thousands of professional transportation vehicles and millions of sideline transportation vehicles throughout the country, and become a huge transportation team in short-distance transportation. This is the requirement for land and highway transportation. In addition, civil aviation transportation is required to strengthen technical management, ensure flight safety, improve transportation efficiency, and better complete various flight tasks in terms of passenger and freight transportation and professional flights.
    All transportation departments, whether it is water, land, or air transportation, must pay attention to safety. This is an important condition for completing the transportation plan.
    Comrades! Everyone has seen the joint notice issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on March 21. That is to say, a conference of representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers will be held in the fourth quarter of this year to commend advanced collectives and advanced producers emerging in industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade, and to summarize and promote advanced experience. Now, the broad masses of workers and staff in various parts of the country are vigorously launching a socialist red flag competition to welcome the convocation of this conference. Such a competition movement is also being launched on the transportation front. I hope that everyone will make outstanding achievements and that more advanced collectives and advanced figures will emerge, using more, better, and more outstanding achievements to complete and overfulfill the national production and construction plan to welcome our tenth anniversary of the National Day!

　　采取多种形式增强短途运输
　　薄一波同志号召苦干巧干开展竞赛
    新华社12日讯　中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波在交通部召开的全国交通运输扩大电话会议上的讲话。全文如下：
    交通运输战线上的全体职工同志们！
    交通部召开的这次电话会议，号召大家在交通运输战线上展开一个轰轰烈烈的红旗竞赛运动，加强交通运输战线上的工作，来保证完成1959年以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国民经济计划。前几天，铁道部已经召开了铁路战线上的红旗竞赛动员大会，在铁路上已经展开了这个运动。全体交通运输战线上的职工同志们一定不会落后，一定会同你们铁路上的兄弟们肩并肩地展开这个运动，相互支援、相互促进，把这个运动搞得更好。现在，我向你们讲几句话。
    去年，你们在社会主义建设大跃进中，已经取得了很大的成绩。由于我们党的各级党委加强了对交通运输事业的领导，贯彻执行了以钢为纲全面跃进的方针，克服了运输工作上的许多困难，从而保证了为完成一千零七十万吨钢为中心的各种运输任务。全年水运、陆运、空运三方面所完成的货物运输量，比1957年增加了一倍还多。创造了许多先进经验，出现了许多令人鼓舞和钦佩的事迹。你们在国民经济全面大跃进中，起了极为重要的促进作用。我在这里代表党中央和国务院，向交通运输战线上的全体职工同志们，致以热烈的祝贺！
    今年，我国社会主义建设将在去年大跃进的基础上继续大跃进。最近我们党的八届七中全会讨论通过了1959年的国民经济计划草案。这个计划草案，是根据八届六中全会提出的钢产量一千八百万吨、煤产量三亿八千万吨、粮食产量一万零五百亿斤、棉花产量一亿担这四大指标和今年第一季度生产和基本建设的情况而编制的。这个计划草案的编制，对于我国物质技术条件的客观可能性和人民群众革命干劲的主观能动性，都作了认真的考虑，这是一个能够实现国民经济继续大跃进的宏伟计划。这个计划草案将由国务院提交第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议审议。我们党的中央委员会深信，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，我国人民继续鼓足干劲，继续发扬苦干、实干、巧干精神，充分发挥各方面的潜在力量，开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，一定能够完成和超额完成1959年国民经济计划。1959年国民经济计划给交通运输部门带来了更为艰巨的任务，要求全国交通运输战线上的全体职工同志们尽更大的努力，做出更好的成绩来，从全国水路运输、公路运输、航空运输三个方面今年货物运输量的总数来看，你们担负的任务是很大的。这是一个继续大跃进的计划。要完成这个计划，水运、陆运、空运各个方面，都要把完成当前的运输任务和搞好基本建设的任务同时都抓起来，而且要搞好。特别是要把当前的运输任务搞好。在地方交通方面要把长途运输和短途运输都很好地抓起来，当前特别要抓好短途运输，要结合利用各种运输设备，发挥各种运输工具的作用。不仅交通运输部门和各个方面应当互相配合，全面协作，而且国民经济的各个有关部门，也要互相配合，全面协作，大家来搞好交通运输，特别是短途运输。在交通运输战线上，短途运输具有重要的作用。今年交通运输部门要完成大量增长的运输任务是存在一些困难的，但是这些困难经过大家努力也是可以克服的。我完全同意交通部各负责同志对大家提出的要求。只要依靠大家的积极性和创造性，大闹技术革命，在全国交通运输各个战线上展开社会主义建设的红旗竞赛，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，学先进、赶先进，掀起一个生产建设的新高潮，在我们面前存在的某些困难，一定能够被我们克服，今年的运输任务一定能够胜利完成。
    在当前的运输工作中，各地都要十分重视短途运输。我在上面已经说过了，短途运输是目前一个最为薄弱的环节。大家知道，农村实现人民公社化以后，生产发展很快，货物运输数量增加很多，但是汽车、轮船增加的不够多，不能满足运输任务的需要。用什么办法来解决这个问题呢？就是要大量使用各种民间运输工具。我们党的省委、市委、地委、县委都要加强对短途运输的领导。因为农村和小城镇的物资的集散，主要依靠人民公社以及生产队来办。要适当地安排短途运输所必需的劳动力，使短途运输有固定的专业运输队，同时也要有副业运输队。对于这些人员，必须贯彻执行社会主义的按劳分配的原则，即多劳多得的原则，确定他们的劳动报酬。这种报酬可以采取基本工资制加上奖励制度，或者采取评工记分的办法，充分发挥人民公社办运输，特别是生产队办运输的积极性。同时，在短途运输上还要逐步改变肩挑人背的运输方式，大搞技术革命。根据因地制宜和就地取材的方针，继续大搞车子化、轨道化、索道化、滑道化，采取多种方式增强短途运输的能力，逐步提高运输工具的技术水平，以节省劳动力。目前，各地人民公社办运输已经有了许多经验，这就要进行总结，把好的经验，加以交流推广。只有这样，才有利于国民经济全面大跃进，有利于工农业生产，有利于人民公社农林牧副渔的多种经营，并且有利于增加社员的收入。我们要求各地人民公社在短途运输方面展开社会主义的红旗竞赛，每县、每社、每队之间进行比赛，看谁的短途运输办得好！同志们，关于短途运输的重要性，我在这个地方不能够一一地讲。总之，在我们这个交通不大发达的国家，现代化的交通，铁路或者汽车运输，航空运输，要跟我们的手工业的手推车、木船、木帆船等等要同时并举，也要贯彻两条腿走路的办法。而今天在短途运输上用这些旧式运输工具来进行运输有特殊重要的意义。
    此外，交通运输战线上的一切方面，都要注重提高劳动生产率，继续发扬共产主义精神，破除迷信，解放思想，创造出新的成绩来。
    我们要求水路运输方面，充分发挥现有轮船和木帆船运输工具的力量，充分利用水路运输，加强船舶周转，提高港口装卸效率，扩大港口通过能力，积极地治理航道，延长通航的里程，提高修船的质量，加快船舶修理时间，这是对水路运输的要求。
    我们要求公路运输方面，推广挂车运输，做好保养修理，节约使用油料和配件，做好道路修建和养护工作，使汽车运输力量在公路干线上发挥更大的作用。积极改良民间运输工具把全国几十万辆专业运输车辆和几百万辆副业运输的车辆充分使用起来，成为短途运输上的一支庞大的运输队伍。这是对陆路、公路上的运输的要求。此外，要求民用航空运输，加强技术管理，确保飞行安全，提高运输效率，在客货运输和专业飞行方面更好地完成各种飞行任务。
    所有运输部门，不管是水路、陆路、或者航空运输，都要注意安全，这是完成运输计划的一个重要条件。
    同志们！大家都已看到了中共中央和国务院3月21日联合发出的一个通知。就是要在今年第四季度召开先进集体、先进生产者代表会议，表扬工业、交通运输业、基本建设和财贸战线上涌现出来的先进集体和先进生产者，总结和推广先进经验。现在全国各地职工群众，正在轰轰烈烈地展开了社会主义的红旗竞赛，来迎接这次会议的召开。在交通运输战线上也正在展开这样的竞赛运动。我希望大家做出卓越的成绩来，有更多的先进集体和先进人物涌现出来，用更多、更好、更卓越的成就，完成和超额完成国家的生产建设计划，来迎接我们的国庆十周年！
