　　Comprehensive Development of Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Fishery
　　Wulian People Enjoying Well-being and Prosperity

　　Jinan, April 6th (Report from our newspaper) The Wulian Mountain area in Shandong, one of the old revolutionary base areas, is now presenting a picture of comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, with a prosperous and flourishing rural economy.

　　Currently, 310,000 mu of lush green wheat in this county is growing vigorously.

　　During spring wheat field management, the people of Wulian focused on addressing the water issue, resolving the serious difficulties in irrigation water in the mountainous area. Now, the clear water in all the mountain streams, gullies, mountain springs, ponds, and reservoirs in the county is flowing through more than 580 large and small channels to the vast majority of wheat fields.

　　The task of deep plowing of more than 430,000 mu of spring fields in this county has been largely completed. Among them, half have reached a depth of one to three Chinese feet, and more than 100,000 mu with thinner soil layers are also above seven or eight inches. Combined with deep plowing and deep turning, most of the terraced fields have been renovated. Spring sowing work is about to begin in full swing.

　　While grasping agricultural production, the people of Wulian have also focused on diversified operations. Now, the county has developed to: sixteen types of animal husbandry including cattle, donkeys, mules, horses, pigs, and sheep; sixteen types of planting including tussah, mulberry, fruit trees, and medicinal herbs; ten types of harvesting including medicine, pine nuts, and wild hemp; and eleven types of weaving including mats, baskets, hampers, and creels. Because each level of Party committee had a secretary in charge of sow breeding last winter, very few of the more than 30,000 sows in the county are not pregnant. During this recent period, approximately 1,500 piglets are being bred daily.

　　All mountains are green, and all water is clear. The large and small mountains in the Wulian Mountain area have been planted with various economic and other trees. From early summer cherries to early winter honey peaches, the county produces fruits in all three seasons of the year. This year, the county plans to produce 15.13 million jin of dried and fresh fruits, striving for 20 million jin, including 800,000 jin of apples, an increase of nine times compared to last year.

　　In order to develop diversified economy, the leading organs of this county have trained more than 5,000 technical personnel; established various bases such as horticultural farms, livestock farms, forest farms, silkworm farms, and livestock breeding farms. Each level of Party committee has dedicated personnel in charge of this work. There are a total of more than 26,000 professional personnel in the county serving the development of diversified economy. A beautiful picture has already emerged before the people of Wulian: herds of mules and horses, pig pens full, cattle and sheep scattered across the mountains; ponds and reservoirs full of fish, ponds full of lotus roots, chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits bustling in the villages; forests shading the sun, roads lined with trees, fragrant melons and fruits sweeter than honey. Their slogan is: turn scattered vacant lots into mulberry fields, turn hillsides into orchards; no commune leaves an inch of land idle, no team wastes a fraction of a mu; making Wulian a prosperous and happy place with abundant food and clothing, thriving people and livestock, beautiful mountains and rivers, and singing birds and fragrant flowers.

    农林牧副渔全面大发展
    五莲人民康乐繁荣
    本报济南6日电　老革命根据地之一的山东五莲山区，现在呈现着一幅农林牧副渔全面大发展、农村经济繁荣昌盛的景象。
    现在，这个县三十一万亩茂密葱绿的小麦正在茁壮地成长。
    在春季麦田管理中，五莲人民突出地抓了水的问题，解决了山区灌溉用水的严重困难。现在，全县所有山涧、沟壑、山泉、塘库内清澈见底的水，通过五百八十多条大小渠道，潺潺地流向绝大部分麦田。
    这个县的四十三万多亩春田，深翻任务大部完成。其中半数达一市尺至三市尺，土层较薄的十万多亩也在七、八寸以上。结合深耕、深翻，梯田已大部整修。春播工作即将全面展开。
    在抓农业生产的同时，五莲人民同时也抓住了多种经营。现在全县已经发展到：牛、驴、骡、马、猪、羊等十六养；柞、桑、果树、药材等十六栽；药、松子、野麻子等十采，和席、篮、筐、篓等十一编。由于去冬各级党委都有一个书记抓母猪配种，全县三万多头母猪很少空怀。在最近这一时期内，每天约繁殖仔猪一千五百头左右。
    有山皆绿，无水不清。五莲山区的大小山岭都已经栽种了各种经济林木及其它林木。从初夏的樱桃到初冬的蜜桃，全县一年三季都产水果。今年全县计划产干、鲜果一千五百一十三万斤，争取二千万斤，其中苹果八十万斤，比去年增加九倍。
    这个县的领导机关为了发展多种经济，训练了约五千多名技术人员；建立了园艺场、畜牧场、林场、蚕场、畜牧繁殖场等各种基地。各级党委都有专人分工负责这项工作。全县共有二万六千多人的专业队伍在为发展多种经济服务。一幅美丽的图景已经呈现在五莲人民的眼前：骡马成群猪满圈，牛羊牲畜遍群山；渔满塘库藕满池，鸡鸭鹅兔闹庄园；林木蔽日路成阴，瓜果芳香赛蜜甜。他们的口号是：零星隙地变桑田，山坡山腰成果园；社社不闲一寸土，队队不丢一厘田；使五莲成为丰衣足食、人畜兴旺、山川秀丽、鸟语花香的繁荣康乐之乡。　（王建林、姜文品）
