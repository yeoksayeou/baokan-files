Grasp Both Ends Simultaneously

    "Grasping both ends and leading the middle" is an important leadership method. "Grasping both ends" means grasping both the advanced and the backward. Generally speaking, the focus should be on grasping the advanced; however, one should not only grasp the advanced and abandon the backward. There are different ways to grasp the backward. The main way to grasp the backward should be to strengthen leadership and provide concrete assistance, enabling them to achieve better results under relatively difficult conditions. This will have a great motivating effect on the overall situation, which is much more effective than simply criticizing.

    The Party Committee of Chengguan Commune in Weinan County changed its previous practice of only focusing on advanced teams and ignoring backward teams, and transferred cadres to help production teams with weaker foundations to do their work well. When the backward teams achieved results, on-site meetings were held there. Facts have proved that this can both encourage backward teams to work hard and strive for improvement, and promote the continuous progress of advanced teams. Since backward teams can catch up with advanced teams, general teams can be even more confident. In this way, a high tide of overall leap forward can be formed.

    However, grasping the backward and grasping the advanced cannot be separated. Only by grasping the advanced can we better lead the backward, and only by grasping the advanced well can we make grasping the backward more effective. We must be good at using the experience of advanced units to enable backward units to catch up with advanced units more quickly.

    两头一齐抓
    “抓两头、带中间”，是一项重要的领导方法。所谓“抓两头”，就是抓先进和落后。一般地说，应以抓先进为主；但是，却不可只抓先进，而丢了落后。抓落后，也有不同的抓法。对落后的，主要的抓法应该是加强领导、具体帮助，在比较困难的条件下做出较好的成绩。这样做，对全局都会起很大的激励作用，要比单纯批评有效得多。
    中共渭南县城关公社党委改变了以往那种只重视先进队、不管落后队的做法，抽调干部帮助基础较差的生产队做好工作。落后队做出了成绩，就在那里召开现场会议。事实证明，这样做既可以鼓励落后队发奋图强，也可以促使先进队不断前进。既然落后队能赶上先进队，一般队就可以更有信心。这样，就可以形成全面跃进的高潮。
    但是，抓落后和抓先进不能分开，只有抓先进，才好带动落后，只有抓先进抓得好，才能使抓落后更有效；要善于运用先进单位的经验，才能使落后单位更快地赶上先进单位。
