(Staff report) Italian Communist Party Delegation Leader Giancarlo Pajetta spoke at a grand welcome rally held on the 13th in Shanghai, attended by over 2,500 representatives of Communist Party members and working people. The following is a summary of his speech:

Comrades: We are very pleased to gather with you and receive your brotherly welcome. On behalf of all Italian communists and all working people, I extend sincere and comradely greetings to the Chinese people.

Our bourgeoisie and reactionary leading groups insist that they cannot recognize the new China and your great People's Republic. This shows that the bourgeoisie does not even possess basic geographical knowledge and refuses to acknowledge or learn from history. Although the bourgeoisie dares not admit it, the Italian working people and communists understand the new China. They know the history of the glorious and protracted revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. They know that your People's Army carried out the world-renowned Long March; they know that the Chinese People's Volunteers waged a heroic struggle against imperialist countries on the Korean battlefield and achieved a great victory. They were excited and moved by this. They also know that your Party has always carried out patient and wise work; they also know the great thought of Chairman Mao Zedong. These ideas are not only a vital part of your Party's theory and policy, but also belong to the entire international workers' movement and the international communist movement.

Shanghai, what a dear name to us! When we were engaged in underground struggles and armed struggles, when we were brutally tortured by the enemy in prison, hearing this name gave us encouragement. When we learned that imperialism and reactionaries attempted to strangle your revolutionary movement with blood, we felt boundless anger. But when we heard of your revolutionary victory and the news of the liberation of Shanghai, we were so happy and excited that tears streamed down our faces.

The respect we express to you is a respect in battle, and the handshake between us is a comradely handshake. We are proud to be communists. Like your party, our party has also suffered the pain of sacrifice. Our leader and mentor, the founder of the party, Comrade Gramsci, sacrificed his life in a fascist bandit prison. But we have also tasted the joy of victory. On the eve of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, we personally captured Mussolini and hanged him with our own hands, allowing the entire working class of Milan to see the fate of this national traitor.

Dear Comrades! I have only stayed in your country for a few days. Your country is so large that it is certainly impossible to have a comprehensive understanding in just a few days. However, there is one thing I have indeed seen, and that is that your Party is very knowledgeable about the actual situation. What your Party cares most about is how to closely connect with the working masses, live, work, and struggle with them, so as to better lead them to achieve the Great Leap Forward.

We have had various contacts with your cadres, party members, workers, farmers, youth, and technicians, so we understand your achievements, your work, and the prospects that lie ahead of you, which are closely related to the great experience of your Party. Your Party has never lost any contact with the masses, so it can stand at the forefront of the masses to lead the struggle. This morning, we visited the No. 2 State Cotton Factory. The leaders and workers there told us that the No. 2 State Cotton Factory is using old machines, which may no longer be used in capitalist countries, but they are still being used in your factory, and they are being used even better. This shows that there is something very advanced in your factory, and that is the socialist system based on the people. In the capitalist world, even if they have some advanced technologies, there is one thing that is already decadent, and that is the capitalist system of man exploiting man.

Dear Comrades, in Italy, we are currently engaged in a difficult struggle to counter the attacks of the bourgeoisie. In recent years, the Italian bourgeoisie has launched a fierce attack on the mass movement. They are trying to regain the achievements we gained in the anti-fascist liberation struggle and hinder us from moving towards socialism. They have repeatedly clamored that the Italian Communist Party is facing a crisis. They thought that this would weaken our strength. But they have been defeated every time.

Our enemies have carried out various repressions against the progressive movement of the working class and the working people. They have squeezed out and attacked communists among workers, in factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools. They thought that this would allow them to seize millions of votes from the Communist Party in the elections. But what is the actual situation? In 1953, we received 6.1 million votes, and in 1958, we received 6.7 million votes. After this general election, the Fanfani government attempted to strengthen the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and subjugate the petty bourgeoisie and working people to its totalitarian rule. However, the Italian working class and petty bourgeoisie, under the leadership of the Party, responded to such attempts with heroic struggles, preventing the Fanfani government's conspiracy from succeeding. The goal of our current struggle is to defend and expand the democratic rights of the working people and to demand the implementation of the Republican Constitution, which has been repeatedly sabotaged by reactionary groups. We must develop this struggle forward until we finally crush the capitalist system. To ensure the victory of this struggle, we are constantly striving to achieve a broader unity of workers, farmers, and all democratic forces. And to achieve such unity, the unity of the working class itself becomes a very important issue. Our current struggle is not only to maintain the unity of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, but also to strengthen this unity through struggle. Recently, although some actions by the upper echelons of the Socialist Party have weakened such political unity, the strength of this unity and the desire for unity have progressed in the struggle of the working class. At present, the Italian working people are living and struggling under difficult economic conditions. This year, 2 million workers are unemployed in Italy, and another 3 million farmers will be evicted from their land within a few years. The Italian Communist Party is uniting all working people to fight for labor rights. Our struggle follows the principle of not forgetting the strategy because of current tactics, that is, not losing the direction of socialism because of immediate struggles. Similarly, we cannot ignore tactics because of strategy, ignoring the leadership of the working people in their daily struggles.

The Italian working class and working people must not only fight against domestic enemies, but also against enemies from abroad. We are suffering under the heavy burden of the American imperialist occupation. Current politicians are attempting to link Italy with the "European Common Market." At the same time, our government has made a more serious decision, which is to accept the will of American imperialism and establish nuclear missile bases on Italian territory, directly endangering the lives of our people. Therefore, we believe that the struggle for peace is a fundamental issue in our struggle. We follow this spirit and fully support the Soviet Union's peace policy and peace proposals. We believe that the solution to the Berlin issue is a condition for guaranteeing European peace and security. Following the same spirit, we also fully support the struggles of all countries and peoples in the world who are suffering from colonial oppression against imperialism and for national independence and freedom. We are also carrying out such struggles in our own country, with the aim of freeing our country from the oppression of American imperialism and becoming an independent and sovereign nation. Therefore, our struggle for peace and freedom and against imperialism is part of the struggle of progressive humanity in the world.

The Italian Communist Party has consistently stood at the forefront of the struggles of the working masses, consistently strived to implement correct struggle policies, and resolutely opposed revisionism and sectarianism.

In our struggle, we are loyal to our own people on the one hand, and loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism on the other. It was in this spirit that we participated in the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties in 1957. Recently, we also participated in the 21st Congress of the CPSU in the same spirit. This congress pointed out the path towards building communism. We are also watching with great interest your achievements in the Great Leap Forward. Similarly, we are strengthening the struggle for the Italian road to socialism.

Dear Comrades, please accept our respects once again. I extend the respects of the Italian Communist Party, the working class, farmers, intellectuals, artisans, and all the Italian people to all the Communist Party members in China and Shanghai, the vanguard of the proletarian revolution, and to the working people of China and Shanghai.

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party! Long live the Soviet Union!
Long live the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world!
Long live Marxism-Leninism!
Long live the eternal friendship between the Italian and Chinese peoples!

　　意大利共产党积极团结一切民主力量
　　反击资产阶级进攻和摆脱美国的压迫
    本报讯　意大利共产党代表团团长贾·巴叶塔在13日上海市共产党员和劳动人民的代表二千五百多人举行的盛大欢迎集会上讲了话，他的讲话摘要如下：
    同志们：我们非常愉快地和你们欢聚一堂，受到你们兄弟般的欢迎。我代表意大利全体共产党人，全体劳动人民向中国人民致以真挚的、兄弟般的同志的问候。
    我国的资产阶级和反动的领导集团，硬说他们不能承认新中国，不承认你们这样伟大的人民共和国，这说明资产阶级甚至连地理常识也没有，说明资产阶级和反动领导集团不承认历史和吸取历史的教训。尽管资产阶级不敢承认，但是，意大利劳动人民和共产党人却了解人民的新中国。他们知道中国人民和中国共产党光荣的长期革命斗争的历史，他们知道你们的人民军队进行过闻名世界的长征；他们知道中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上对帝国主义国家进行了英勇的斗争，并且获得了伟大的胜利。他们曾经为此兴奋而感动。他们也知道你们党一直进行耐心的明智的工作；他们也知道毛泽东主席伟大的思想。这些思想，不仅是你们党的理论和政策的一个极重要的部分，同时也是属于整个国际工人运动和国际共产主义运动的。
    上海，这个名字对我们是多么亲切啊！我们在进行地下斗争和武装斗争的时候，在监狱里受到敌人的残酷折磨的时候，听到了这个名字就得到了鼓舞。当我们知道帝国主义和反动派企图用血来扼杀你们革命运动的时候，我们感到无比的愤怒。但是，当我们听到你们革命的胜利，听到上海解放消息的时候，我们又是多么的愉快和兴奋，以至流下了激动的眼泪。
    我们向你们表示的敬意是战斗中的敬意，我们之间的握手是同志间的握手。我们为我们是共产党员而自豪。我们的党同你们一样，也曾遭受过牺牲的痛苦，我们的领袖和导师、党的创始人葛兰西同志就牺牲在法西斯强盗的监狱中。但是，我们也曾尝到胜利的愉快。在世界反法西斯战争胜利的前夜，我们曾经亲自抓住墨索里尼，并用自己的双手把他吊死，使米兰市全体工人阶级看到这个民族叛徒的下场。
    亲爱的同志们！我只在你们的国家逗留了几天，你们的国家是这样大，当然不可能在几天之内就能有全面的了解。但是，有一件事情，我确实已经看到了，这就是你们党是非常了解实际情况的。你们党所最关心的就是如何能够密切联系劳动群众，和他们共同生活、共同劳动、共同斗争，以便更好地领导他们实现大跃进。
    我们曾经和你们的干部、党员和工人、农民以及青年、技术人员进行了各种接触，所以我们了解你们的成就、你们的工作以及在你们前面所展示的前景，这些都和你们党的伟大的经验有着密切的联系。你们的党从来没有和群众失去任何联系，所以能够站在群众的前列，来领导斗争。今天早晨，我们去参观了国棉二厂，那里的领导人和工人告诉我们，国棉二厂在使用着旧的机器，这些旧的机器也许在资本主义国家里已经不再使用了，可是在你们的工厂里却还在使用着，而且使用得更好。这说明，在你们这个厂里有着一件非常先进的东西，这就是以人民为基础的社会主义制度。在资本主义世界，即使他们还有一些先进的技术，但是有一件东西已经是腐朽的了，这就是人剥削人的资本主义制度。
    亲爱的同志们，我们在意大利正在进行着反击资产阶级进攻的艰苦斗争。意大利资产阶级在最近几年来，向群众运动进行了猛烈的进攻。他们企图夺回我们在反法西斯的解放斗争中所获得的成就，阻挠我们走向社会主义。他们曾经多次叫嚣：意大利共产党面临危机了。他们以为这样，就可以削弱我们的力量。但是，他们每次都遭到了失败。
    我们的敌人曾经对工人阶级和劳动人民的进步运动进行各种镇压。他们在工人中间，在工厂、企业、机关、学校中排挤和打击共产党人。他们以为这样就可以在选举中夺取共产党的几百万张选票。但是，实际情况怎样呢？在1953年，我们所得到的票数是六百一十万张，而1958年，我们得到的票数就增加到了六百七十万张。在这次大选以后，范范尼政府曾经企图强化资产阶级的专政，使小资产阶级和劳动人民屈服在它的极权主义的统治下。但是，意大利工人阶级和小资产阶级在党的领导下以英勇的斗争回击了这样的企图，使范范尼政府的阴谋不能得逞。我们现在斗争的目标是要保卫和扩大劳动人民的民主权利，要求执行一再遭到反动集团破坏的共和国宪法。我们要把这个斗争向前发展下去，以至最后粉碎资本主义制度。为了保证这个斗争的胜利，我们在不断争取实现工人、农民和一切民主力量的更广泛的团结。而要实现这样的团结，工人阶级自己的团结就成为一个非常重要的问题。我们现在正在进行的斗争不仅是使共产党和社会党保持团结，并且通过斗争加强这种团结。最近，虽然由于社会党的上层分子的一些做法使这样的政治团结遭受到一些削弱，但是，这种团结的力量和团结的愿望却在工人阶级的斗争中有所进展。目前，意大利劳动人民在困难的经济情况下生活着和斗争着。今年在意大利有二百万工人失业，还有三百万农民将在几年之内被驱逐离开他们的土地。意大利共产党正在团结着全体劳动人民进行争取劳动权利的斗争。我们的斗争是遵循着这样的原则：不要因为当前的策略而忘记了战略，也就是说，不要因为眼前的斗争失去了社会主义的方向。同样地，也不能因为战略而忽视策略，忽视领导劳动人民进行日常的斗争。
    意大利工人阶级和劳动人民不仅要同国内的敌人作斗争，还要同来自国外的敌人作斗争。我们遭受着美帝国主义占领的重担。现在的政界人士企图把意大利和“欧洲共同市场”联系起来，同时，我国政府又作出了一个更严重的决定，这就是接受美帝国主义的意旨，在意大利领土上设立原子导弹基地，直接危害我国人民的生命。因此，我们认为，争取和平的斗争是我们斗争中的一个根本问题。我们遵循了这样的精神，全力支持苏联的和平政策和和平的建议。我们认为，柏林问题的解决，是一个保证欧洲和平和安全的条件。遵循着同样的精神，我们也全力支持世界上一切遭受殖民主义压迫的国家和人民所进行的反对帝国主义、争取民族独立和自由的斗争。我们在自己的国家也进行着这样的斗争，目的是使我们的国家摆脱美帝国主义的压迫，成为独立主权的国家。所以，我们的争取和平、自由，反对帝国主义的斗争是世界进步人类斗争的一部分。
    意大利共产党是一贯站在劳动群众斗争的前列，一贯努力执行正确的斗争政策，坚决反对修正主义和宗派主义。
    我们在斗争中，一方面忠于本国人民，同时，也忠于马克思列宁主义的原则，忠于无产阶级国际主义。我们就是本着这样的精神在1957年参加了莫斯科共产党、工人党会议。在最近，我们也本着同样的精神参加了苏共二十一次代表大会。这次代表大会给人们指出了走向建设共产主义的道路。我们也以极大的兴趣注视着你们在大跃进中的成就。同样，我们也正在为走向社会主义的意大利道路而加强斗争。
    亲爱的同志们，请再次接受我们的敬意，我向中国和上海市的全体共产党员、无产阶级革命的先锋队伍，向中国和上海市的劳动人民，转达意大利共产党、工人阶级、农民、知识分子、手工业者，以及全体意大利人民的敬意。
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    中国共产党的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！苏联万岁！
    世界共产党和工人党团结万岁！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
    意大利人民和中国人民之间的永恒的友谊万岁！
