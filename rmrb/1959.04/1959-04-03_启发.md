Inspiration

	The constant emergence of advanced figures at the forefront of the struggle is a characteristic of our country. Just a few days ago, I read the news about Li Tianzhu loving the commune as his home, doing the work of two people alone, and accumulating over six hundred workdays in a year. Today, we see the story of production team leader Zhang Jiangkao, who is both skilled in office work and physical labor. The production team he leads excels in all aspects of work, with the team's grain yield increasing from 403 jin per mu in 1957 to 616 jin per mu. He himself accumulated 610 workdays in a year, becoming the person with the most workdays in the entire team.
    This event has given us great inspiration.
    Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, with heavy workloads and many tasks, and when cadres need to devote more energy and time to leadership work, why is it that Zhang Jiangkao not only does his job well, but also does his physical labor so well? Doesn't a contradiction exist between carrying out leadership work and participating in physical labor for him?
    Contradictions do exist, but he has found a way to resolve them. Every contradiction has its opposing side, but it also has its unified side. Under certain conditions, contradictions can be transformed and resolved. How is the contradiction between work and labor resolved in Zhang Jiangkao's case? It is because he has a strong production perspective and mass perspective. Therefore, he can do his job better through labor and by relying on the masses, and also stay ahead of others in labor.
    Zhang Jiangkao has a clear understanding that the fundamental task of a production team leader is to improve production. He said: "If production is improved, it proves that you are doing a good job. If production is not improved, then it means that you have not done your job well." Well said, profoundly said, grasping the key to resolving the contradiction between work and labor. Under the guidance of this idea, he tightly grasped production, strived to improve working methods, and brought work to the fields, working while laboring. Therefore, he can more timely discover and raise problems in his work, and more easily avoid and overcome bureaucratic and subjective errors. This is precisely the first reason why Zhang Jiangkao's work is so vibrant and his labor is stronger than the average person.
    Secondly, Zhang Jiangkao also understands that building socialism is everyone's desire, and developing production is everyone's requirement. To improve production, everyone must work together with one heart. How to give full play to everyone's enthusiasm? Zhang Jiangkao does not point fingers at the masses with the "airs" of a cadre, but rather appears among the masses as an ordinary laborer, using his own practical actions as an example to influence the masses. Because he is willing to work hard in everything and take the lead everywhere, the masses have developed deep feelings and trust for him, seeing him as one of their own. They say, "As long as Jiangkao says something, we'll do whatever he asks us to do." The masses are a great force and have infinite wisdom. With the vast masses to rely on, what can Zhang Jiangkao not do well!
    The reason why Zhang Jiangkao has become a cadre who is good at both work and labor is not only because he has implemented the production perspective and mass perspective in his work, but also because he has scientific working methods and the habit of diligent production. Working methods are the means to achieve policies and tasks. Without scientific working methods, correct policies and tasks cannot achieve the expected results. Zhang Jiangkao has a clear production perspective and a strong mass perspective, and at the same time he has a way to combine work and production, which enables him to not only do his job well, but also labor well. Of course, the reason why Zhang Jiangkao can get more workdays than others despite having less labor time than the average commune member is also related to his love of labor and his ability to labor. He came from a poor peasant family and developed a habit of diligent production, learning good skills, all of which are worth learning from.
    This is an inspiration. Since Zhang Jiangkao can combine work and labor so well and become a cadre skilled in both office work and physical labor, other commune captains and cadres must also be able to combine work and production well. We believe that in the near future, various fronts will surely produce their own "Zhang Jiangkaos" in batches.

    启发
  　丁山
    不断地涌现着走在斗争前面的先进人物，是我们国家的一个特色。前几天刚刚读了李天柱爱社如家，一人做活顶两人，一年做了六百多个劳动日的消息；今天又出现了生产队长张江考善文善武的事迹。他领导的生产队，样样工作做得出色，全队粮食产量由1957年的每亩四百零三斤提高到六百一十六斤；他自己在一年中还做了六百一十个劳动日，成为全队劳动日最多的人。
    这件事，给了我们很大的启发。
    为什么在大跃进的形势下，在工作多、任务重的情况下，需要干部用更多的精力、更多的时间进行领导工作的时候，而张江考不仅能把工作做得很好，他自己的劳动也能做得那样好？难道在他面前不存在着进行领导工作和参加体力劳动的矛盾吗？
    矛盾是存在的，只是他找到了解决矛盾的办法。任何矛盾都有它对立的一面，但也有它统一的一面。在一定的条件下，矛盾是可以转化，可以解决的。工作和劳动的矛盾在张江考身上怎样解决的呢？就是因为他具有坚强的生产观点和群众观点，因此他能通过劳动、依靠群众把工作做得更好，劳动也走在别人的前面。
    张江考有一个明确的认识，生产队长的根本任务是把生产搞好。他说：“生产搞好了，证明你工作做得好；生产搞得不好，那也就说明你的工作没有做好。”说得好，说得深刻，抓住了解决工作和劳动的矛盾的关键。在这种思想指导下，他紧紧地抓住了生产，努力改进工作方法，把工作带到田间去，一边劳动一边工作，因此他能更及时地发现和提出工作中的问题，比较容易地避免和克服官僚主义和主观主义的错误。这正是张江考的工作做得有声有色，劳动也比一般人强的第一个原因。
    其次，张江考还懂得，建设社会主义是大家的愿望，发展生产是大家的要求，要搞好生产，必须大家齐心合力共同努力。怎样把每个人的积极性都充分发挥起来？张江考不是以干部的“派头”对群众指手划脚，而是用普通劳动者的身份出现在群众之中，用以身作则的实际行动来影响群众。由于他事事肯干，处处带头，群众对他产生了深厚的感情和信任，把他看作自己人，他们说，“只要江考说句话，叫咱干啥就干啥”。群众是伟大的力量和无穷的智慧。张江考有了广大群众作依靠，那还有什么办不好的事呢！
    张江考所以成为一个工作好、劳动好的干部，除了因为他在工作中贯彻了生产观点和群众观点之外，还因为他有科学的工作方法和勤劳生产的习惯。工作方法是实现方针任务的手段。没有科学的工作方法，正确的方针任务也就不能收到预期的效果。张江考有了明确的生产观点和坚强的群众观点，同时又有把工作和生产结合起来的办法，这就使他不仅工作做得好，也能劳动得好。当然，张江考所以能在劳动时间比一般社员少，而得到的劳动日却比人多，还和他爱劳动，会劳动有关系。他出身贫农家庭，养成了勤劳生产的习惯，学得一手好技术，这些都是值得我们学习的。
    这是一个启发。张江考既然能把工作和劳动结合得很好，成为善文善武的干部；其它公社的队长和干部也一定能把工作和生产结合得很好。我们相信，在不久的将来，各个战线一定会成批地出现自己的“张江考”。
