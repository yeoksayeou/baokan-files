Xinhua News Agency, April 11th - After fighting a beautiful battle in production in the first quarter, capital workers have again completed the total output value plan for the first ten days of April with a surplus of 1.7%. Among them, major products with ten-day plans, such as cement, coke, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, bearings, and boiler locomotives, have all completed or overfulfilled their plans. In addition, the pig iron output already completed in these ten days is close to one-half of the monthly plan, coal and electricity are close to one-third of the monthly plan, and steel and steel products have completed more than one-quarter of the monthly plan.

The "Three Highs" (high output, high quality, high efficiency) red flag competition conference held at the end of March has pushed the production enthusiasm of the capital's workers to a new level. In the first ten days of April, all walks of life in the city used the "Three Highs" as the guiding principle to organize competition teams, find targets (find competitors), and launched large-scale competitions between shifts, groups, individuals, and different industries in the same trades.

In the competition, some units currently in the lead have paid attention to adopting work methods of timely evaluation, discovering typical examples, establishing pacesetters, and driving the general. This allows everyone to actively find the advanced factors of others, everyone has clear goals to catch up with, and everyone is involved in the torrent of the technical revolution. The weaving workshop of the Beijing Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory vigorously publicized the advanced deeds of the skillful girl Liang Xiaofen. Liang Xiaofen's output was 25.14% higher than the average of the entire workshop, and the quality was 24.23% higher. Weaver Ping Xiuwen's production performance was not as good as Liang Xiaofen's in the past, but after learning from Liang Xiaofen's advanced experience, her current rate of qualified products has reached 92.6%, surpassing Liang Xiaofen's level. Three of the four weavers in the entire workshop have now caught up with Liang Xiaofen. Liang Xiaofen is also not willing to lag behind and is stepping up her efforts to move forward. In order to give laggards the confidence to catch up and to make the advanced even more advanced, many units have paid attention to summarizing the specific experiences of one person and one thing at any time in the competition, and have promptly held various forms of technical research conferences and on-site meetings to study and promote these advanced experiences. Some units have also sent people to workshops to guide and spread experience, so that the majority of employees have "pacesetters" to chase and specific experiences to learn from.

In the booming mass competition upsurge, leading cadres of some units that are currently in a relatively leading position have paid special attention to going deep into workshops and groups, and conducting daily and shift-by-shift checks on each topic according to the arranged production schedule. At the same time, they work with workers and technicians to solve key problems in production. After the leading cadres of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company went to the No. 1 blast furnace of the ironmaking plant as "soldiers," they found that there was a lot of coking inside the blast furnace, the air volume was insufficient, and the iron tapping was not smooth. They studied with workers and technicians, and finally made a firm decision to wash the furnace three times in a row with average slag. As a result, the furnace was indeed improved, and the production situation improved day by day. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace increased from 1.38 to about 1.6.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 11th - Since April, the vast number of workers on the industrial front in Tianjin have launched a greater production upsurge. According to preliminary statistics, more than 300 factories in the city have completed or overfulfilled their plans for the first ten days of April.

Many factory workers who are rushing to manufacture rolling mills, mining equipment, irrigation and drainage equipment, and coal washing and coking equipment have been working with soaring enthusiasm since the beginning of the month. The Xin Gonglian Machine Factory accepted the production task of 117 coal washing machines in April. The workers immediately put forward the action slogan of "competing for every second and racing against time," and set off a heat wave of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. By the 10th, 77 units had been completed. The drilling machine parts factory, which produces mining equipment, has vigorously carried out technical revolution and technical innovation through group competitions, machine competitions, and individual competitions, and organized special forces to check the implementation of various measures at any time. As of the 6th, it has completed the plan to produce 4,000 mining drill bits for the entire month ahead of schedule.

The workers of the Tianjin Paper Mill, who fully completed the production plan in the first quarter, continued to overproduce every day in April, and by the 9th, they had overfulfilled the national plan for the first ten days by 5.42%. In order to ensure a greater leap forward in production in April, the workers of the Tongsheng Chemical Plant, which produces chemical raw materials, have put forward more than 160 innovation proposals and technical measures in the past few days, and 64 of them have been realized. The entire plant completed the plan for the first ten days of April on the 8th, and the average daily output increased by 30% compared with March.

Since entering April, many industrial leading departments and factories have made specific arrangements according to projects and products, and have assigned special personnel to be responsible for supervising and inspecting on time, day by day, and ten days by ten days; they have also adopted the method of grasping tightly, vigorously, and practically for various measures. This has played a significant role in ensuring that each factory completes the production plan on time, day by day, and ten days by ten days.

　　超额完成四月上旬工业总产值计划
　　首都工人更上一层楼
　　天津三百多个工厂抓紧抓狠抓实创造出色成绩
    新华社11日讯　第一季度在生产上打了漂亮仗的首都工人，又以额超1.7％的成绩完成了4月上旬的总产值计划。其中，水泥、焦炭、棉纱、棉布、轴承、锅驼机等有旬计划的主要产品，都完成或超额完成了计划，此外，在这十天里已经完成的生铁产量，接近月计划的二分之一，煤、电接近月计划的三分之一，钢和钢材则完成了月计划的四分之一以上。
    3月底举行的高产、高质、高效率的“三高”红旗竞赛大会，把首都工人群众的生产积极性又推向一个新的水平。4月上旬，全市各行各业都以“三高”为纲编辫子（组织竞赛队伍），找对象（找竞赛对手），分别开展了声势浩大的班与班、组与组、个人与个人之间和各行业间的同工种的竞赛。
    在竞赛中，目前处于领先状态的一些单位，都注意采取了及时评比，发现典型，树立标兵，带动一般的工作方法，使人人都主动地去找别人先进的因素，人人都有明确的追赶目标，人人都卷进技术革命的洪流。北京机织印染厂织场车间大张旗鼓地宣传了巧姑娘梁小芬的先进事迹。梁小芬的产量比全车间平均高25.14％，质量高24.23％。织布工平秀文过去生产成绩不如梁小芬，可是学习了梁小芬的先进经验后，她现在的正品率已经达到了92.6％，超过了梁小芬的水平。全车间四个织布车工现在已有三个追上了梁小芬。梁小芬也不甘落后，正在加紧往前赶。为了使落后者有信心赶上去，使先进者更加先进，许多单位在竞赛中都注意随时总结一人一事的具体经验，并且及时召开各种形式的技术研究会、现场会，研究和推广这些先进经验，有的单位还派人下车间指导传播经验，使广大职工既有“标兵”可追，又有具体的经验可以学习。
    在轰轰烈烈的群众竞赛高潮中，目前比较领先的一些单位的领导干部，都特别注意深入车间、小组，按照排定的生产进度表逐日逐班逐题地进行检查，同时和工人、技术人员一起解决生产中的关键问题。石景山钢铁公司领导干部下到炼铁厂一号高炉“当兵”后，发现高炉里面结焦多，风量不足，出铁不够顺当，就和工人、技术人员一起研究，最后下了一个狠心，连着三次加均炉渣洗炉，这一来，炉子果然好了，生产情况一天胜过一天，高炉利用系数由一点三八提高到一点六左右。
    新华社天津11日电　4月份以来，天津市工业战线广大职工掀起了更大的生产高潮。据初步统计，全市有三百多个工厂完成或提前完成了4月上旬计划。
    正在赶制轧钢、矿山、排灌、洗煤炼焦设备的许多工厂职工，月初以来干劲冲天。新工联机器厂4月份接受了一百一十七台洗煤机的生产任务，职工们立即提出“争分秒、赶时间”的行动口号，掀起了学先进比先进赶先进热潮，到10日已经完成了七十七台。生产矿山设备的钻探机零件厂，通过小组赛、机台赛和个人赛，大搞技术革命和技术革新，组织专门力量随时检查各项措施的实现情况，截至6日已提前完成了全月生产四千个矿山用钻头的计划。
    在第一季度里全面完成生产计划的天津造纸总厂职工，4月份继续作到了日日超产，到9日就超额5.42％全面完成了上旬国家计划。生产化工原料的同生化工厂职工，为了保证4月份的生产更大跃进，全厂几天来共提出了一百六十多件革新建议和技术措施，有六十四件已经实现。全厂在8日就完成了4月上旬计划，平均日产量比3月份提高30％。
    进入4月份以来，许多工业领导部门和工厂都按项目、按产品作了具体安排，并且设有专人负责按时按日按旬督促检查；对于各项措施也采取了抓紧抓狠抓实的办法。这对保证各厂按时按日按旬完成生产计划起了重大作用。
