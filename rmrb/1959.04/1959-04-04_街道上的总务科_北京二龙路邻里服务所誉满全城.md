    The Erlong Road Neighborhood Service Center in Beijing is Praised Throughout the City
    (Our Newspaper Reporter Shen Lizhu reports) The service spirit of the Erlong Road Neighborhood Service Center in Xicheng District, Beijing, affectionately known by residents as the "Street General Affairs Office," has been praised throughout the city. On the 2nd, the Beijing Women's Federation held an on-site meeting to introduce their experiences in serving production and the masses.
    This neighborhood service center was established last August by four street activists based on the demands of the masses. At that time, a large number of housewives participated in productive labor. In addition to sending their children to nurseries and eating in canteens, they also had many trivial matters in their lives that needed help. The Erlong Road Neighborhood Service Center gradually met these needs. Initially, the center only sold newspapers, handled bank savings business, and paged telephones. Later, the scope of services gradually expanded, and the number of temporary and regular service items increased to more than forty, receiving an average of about two hundred people every day.
    The service center's services are rich and diverse, from mending clothes and socks to taking care of patients, fetching water, sweeping houses, and taking children to see doctors; from beautifying homes to writing letters and claiming lost items; from collecting rent and utility bills to selling theater tickets, books, and newspapers; it also helps people move, hire vehicles, and even store keys for residents.
    Nearby residents praised the service center's spirit of service. People who come to the service center often "frown when they arrive, and leave with smiles." Zheng Mengrong, a mother of six children, joined street production, and the neighborhood service center mended all the children's clothes and socks. A woman at No. 36, Xijingji Road, was about to give birth in the middle of the night, and the neighborhood service center called a taxi to take her to the hospital. A cadre living in Dasha Gu Hutong was getting married but had no time to clean up the house. The neighborhood service center sent three people to help him rush for an evening, tidying up the new house beautifully. When it was hot, an old woman selling popsicles came to the center every day to inquire about the weather forecast to determine how much stock to purchase. If a pedestrian discovered that a button on their clothes was about to fall off, they would come in, and the people at the neighborhood service center would immediately sew it on firmly.
    The neighborhood service center currently has six service personnel, all of whom were housewives who stepped out of their families last year. Because the service center has many temporary businesses that require a mobile workforce, the service center has linked up with more than thirty residents nearby who cannot participate in productive labor, and they are invited to participate in service work when the work is busy.
    The neighborhood service center charges lower fees for its services. Mending a pair of socks costs only one or two jiao, and washing a quilt costs only five jiao. Residents participating in production also receive a 20% discount. Some service items, such as selling theater tickets, writing letters, and hiring vehicles, are temporarily free of charge.
    Li Shufang, a service worker at the neighborhood service center, said at the on-site meeting to more than six hundred housewives and street cadres: We are doing work to serve production and the masses. There are many service targets, and the service content is very complex and trivial. Therefore, all the service workers in our center have made plans to continuously improve their ideology of serving the people, improve their service attitude, and improve their business level so as to serve everyone better and more thoughtfully.

### “街道上的总务科”  北京二龙路邻里服务所誉满全城

    “街道上的总务科”
    北京二龙路邻里服务所誉满全城
    本报讯　记者沈骊珠报道：被居民们亲切地称为“街道总务科”的北京市西城区二龙路邻里服务所的服务精神已经誉满全城。2日，北京市妇女联合会特召开现场会议，介绍他们为生产为群众服务的经验。
    这个邻里服务所是去年8月由四个街道积极分子根据群众要求办起来的。当时大批家庭妇女参加生产劳动，她们除了把孩子送进托儿所、到食堂用饭以外，还有很多生活琐事需要有人帮助处理。二龙路邻里服务所逐步地满足了她们的这种要求。最初，这个所只卖报纸、代办银行储蓄业务、传呼电话，后来服务范围逐步扩大，临时性和经常性的服务项目增加到四十多种，平均每天接待二百人左右。
    邻里服务所的服务内容丰富多样，从拆洗缝补衣袜到代为服侍病人、挑水扫房、带小孩看病；从美化家庭到代写书信，招领失物；从代收房租水电费到代售戏票、图书报刊；还帮助群众搬家，代雇车辆，以至为居民存放钥匙。
    附近居民对服务所的这种服务精神，交口赞扬。来服务所的人常常是“来时锁眉头，走时笑颜开。”六个孩子的妈妈郑梦荣参加街道生产后，孩子们的衣袜全是邻里服务所给缝补。西京畿道三十六号一个妇女半夜要生孩子，邻里服务所给她叫了出租汽车送她到医院。住在大沙果胡同的一个干部要结婚了，没有时间整理房子，邻里服务所去了三个人帮助他突击了一个晚上，把新房收拾得漂漂亮亮。天热时，一个卖冰棍的老太太天天到所里来打听天气预报，决定自己进货多少。行人发现衣服扣子要掉了，走进来，邻里服务所的人便立刻为他缝牢。
    邻里服务所现在共有六个服务员，她们全部是去年才走出家庭的家庭妇女。因为服务所有许多临时性的业务，需要有一批机动的劳动力，因此服务所同附近三十多名不能出来参加生产劳动的居民挂了钩，工作忙时就请他们参加服务工作。
    邻里服务所在服务中收费较低，补一双袜子只收费一两角，拆洗一条被子只收费五角，对参加生产的居民还给以八折的优待。有些服务项目，如代售戏票、代写书信、代雇车辆等等则暂不收费。
    邻里服务所的服务员李淑芳在现场会议上向六百多个家庭妇女和街道干部说：我们做的是为生产为群众服务的工作，服务对象很多，服务内容又非常复杂琐碎，因此我们全所的服务员都订了规划，决心不断提高自己为人民服务的思想，改进服务态度，提高业务水平，以便为大家服务得更好、更周到。
