Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 5th: Shanghai's steel plants are actively taking measures to prepare for heatstroke prevention and cooling before the arrival of summer.

Due to the continuous increase in steelmaking equipment, the number of steelworkers in Shanghai working in high temperatures this year is about double that of last year. In addition to conducting heatstroke prevention and cooling publicity for workers, the factories are also preparing heat insulation and cooling equipment for high-temperature workshops, such as fans, high-speed atomizers, and cold air showers. The furnace for melting soda ash at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 originally had no top, causing soda ash to fly around and the temperature to be high. Now they have converted the furnace to a reverberatory furnace with a covered top, eliminating the ash and reducing the temperature by 15 degrees Celsius. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 have partially enclosed some cranes and installed air-conditioning equipment to protect crane operators from rising heat and dust.

The factories have also erected large sunshades for workers mining ore and other outdoor workers.

The factories attach great importance to utilizing existing conditions for ventilation and cooling. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and the newly built Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 have demolished temporary sheds and other buildings outside the factory buildings that obstruct ventilation, making full use of the factory windows for ventilation. With the help of teachers and students from Tongji University, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 is preparing to dig a well next to the rolling mill in the new medium plate workshop and use air ducts to draw the cold air from the well into the workshop. The factories are also paying attention to adjusting labor organization to prevent workers from suffering heatstroke due to fatigue. Workers in the high-temperature workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 implement a small shift adjustment method within the shift, allowing each person to rest for ten to twenty minutes after working for two hours. All factories have set up some cool rest areas.

Improving canteen hygiene and other aspects of hygiene in daily life is also an aspect that all factories value.

### 上钢及早准备防暑降温

    上钢及早准备防暑降温
    据新华社上海5日电　上海各钢铁厂正在积极采取措施，做好夏季到来前的防暑降温准备工作。
    由于炼钢设备的不断增加，今年上海市在高温中工作的钢铁工人比去年增加一倍左右。各厂除了向工人进行防暑降温宣传以外，还在为高温车间准备风扇、高速喷雾器、冷空气淋浴等隔热降温装备。上钢一厂熔化纯碱的炉子本来没有顶，碱粉飞扬，温度也高，现在他们把炉子改为反射炉，炉顶有了盖，碱粉不飞了，温度降低了十五度（摄氏）。上钢一厂和上钢三厂将部分行车密闭，并且安装了冷气设备，使行车工人不受地面上升的热气和灰尘的侵袭。
    各厂还为露天打矿石的工人和其他露天作业的工人搭起了遮太阳的大席棚。
    各厂十分重视利用现有条件来通风降温。上钢一厂和新建的上钢五厂，拆掉了厂房外面阻碍通风的临时工棚等建筑物，充分利用厂房的窗户通风。上钢三厂在同济大学师生的帮助下，准备在新建的中板车间轧钢机旁边开一个水井，用风管将井内冷气抽到车间。各厂并注意调整劳动组织，使工人不致因疲劳引起中暑。上钢一厂高温车间工人，在班内实行小调班的办法，每人劳动两小时就可以休息十分钟到二十分钟。各厂都设立了一些凉爽的休息室。
    改善食堂卫生和其他生活方面的卫生工作，也是各厂重视的一个方面。
