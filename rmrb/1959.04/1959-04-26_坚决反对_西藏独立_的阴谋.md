To the Editor:

We are sincerely happy and resolutely support the State Council's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government.

The former Tibetan local government colluded with imperialists and foreign reactionaries, undermining the unity of the motherland and national solidarity, launching a rebellion, and announcing the long-planned "Tibet independence." This is a sinful act that the 1.1 million Tibetan working people and patriotic upper and middle class figures cannot tolerate.

On April 18, Indian Foreign Ministry officials distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." This "statement" distorted the facts and confused right and wrong, and we express our resolute opposition.

This "statement," issued in the name of the Dalai Lama, is a groundless and contradictory thing. The "statement" uses the argument that "Tibetans and Chinese Han people are different" and actually says that Tibet should be "independent." This is complete nonsense. The "statement's" claim that "Tibetans have always had a strong desire for independence" is even more ridiculous. We want to ask: When did the vast majority of Tibetan people express their desire to secede from the motherland and live the darkest and most miserable colonial life in the world? If you—the expansionist elements in India—are referring to that small group of traitorous Tibetans, those enemies of the Tibetan working people, the imperialist running dogs, the devils who grew up eating human flesh and drinking human blood, who want to rely on imperialism and ride on the backs of the people, shouting "Tibet independence," that is indeed the case. However, a small group of reactionaries cannot represent the 1.1 million Tibetan people and have already been abandoned by the Tibetan people.

Tibet has always been Chinese territory; this is a fact recognized worldwide. The Tibetan people have repeatedly bravely resisted the invasion of imperialist colonialists together with the people of the motherland to defend the motherland. In 1904, Britain dreamed of seizing Tibet. At that time, the patriotic monks and laypeople were unwilling to leave the embrace of the motherland and bravely rose up to fight, using backward firelocks and throwing stones against the most ferocious invading army. At that time, the flames of anti-aggression burned fiercely, and the voices of anti-aggression shook the heavens and the earth. The British invaders falsely claimed to be negotiating peace, but killed two Daipon in Gyantse and massacred many monks and laypeople in Gyantse on the spot, with blood flowing like rivers. The blood of these martyrs irrigated the land of Tibet, and they used their blood to defend the Tibet of the motherland.

In the days that followed, all British imperialist activities in Tibet were resisted by the Tibetan people. British imperialism had troops and commissioners stationed in Lhasa and Gyantse, and their every move was met with contempt by the Tibetan people. Some people spat at them when they saw them, and some recited evil curses. In order to cultivate some slaves, British imperialism established a school in Zhongjilinka, Lhasa. The Tibetan people hated this school to the extreme. When those British "teachers" appeared in the streets and alleys, people sang behind them: "The teacher is a British big-nosed ghost, and the students are thorns in our eyes." These two lines are still circulating among the citizens of Lhasa today. The British imperialists were later forced to stop the plan to run this slave school.

The above facts show that the Tibetan people love the motherland. The Tibetan people hate imperialism. All the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and its running dogs have gone bankrupt under the sharp eyes and struggles of the Tibetan people. The vast working people of Tibet are in the darkest feudal serf system in the world. In order to achieve complete liberation and seek a happy life, they can only take the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group always tried every means to resist the central government's policies and repeatedly blocked the Tibetan people's eager desire for democratic reform. In March of this year, they openly colluded with imperialists and foreign reactionaries, gathered rebels from all over Tibet, and launched an armed rebellion, attempting to permanently maintain a parasitic life without labor.

Completely contrary to the wishes of the reactionary traitorous group and its masters, Tibet has been reborn since then, and a democratic socialist new Tibet is about to be realized. We Tibet will forever get rid of the shackles of serfdom and, together with our fraternal nationalities in the motherland, jointly build the socialist family of the motherland. We are all Tibetan youths trained and educated by the Party and will definitely contribute all our strength to the revolution and construction of the new Tibet!

### 坚决反对“西藏独立”的阴谋

    坚决反对“西藏独立”的阴谋
    编辑同志：
    国务院下令解散原西藏地方政府，我们从心里高兴，并且坚决支持。
    原西藏地方政府勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，破坏祖国统一和民族团结，发动叛乱，并宣布蓄谋已久的“西藏独立”，这是我们西藏一百一十几万劳动人民和爱国中上层人士不能容忍的一件罪恶行为。
    4月18日，印度外交部官员散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这个“声明”颠倒黑白，混淆是非，我们表示坚决反对。
    以达赖名义发表的这个“声明”，是毫无事实根据、矛盾百出的一个东西。“声明”中把“西藏人和中国的汉人不同”作为论据，竟然说西藏应该“独立”。这完全是骗人的鬼话。“声明”中所说的“西藏人一向有一种要求独立的强烈愿望”更是胡言乱语。我们要问：绝大多数的藏族人民什么时候表露过要从祖国分裂出去，去过人世间最黑暗最悲惨的殖民地生活？如果你们——印度的扩张主义分子指的是那一小撮叛国的西藏人，他们——西藏劳动人民的死敌、帝国主义的走狗、吃人肉喝人血长大的魔鬼，想依附帝国主义，骑在人民头上，叫嚷“西藏独立”，这倒是事实。然而，一小撮反动分子是代表不了一百一十几万藏族人民的，而且已经为西藏人所抛弃。
    西藏一向是中国的领土，这是全世界公认的事实。西藏人民为了保卫祖国曾多次英勇地同祖国人民一起反抗过帝国主义殖民者的侵略。1904年，英国梦想霸占西藏。那时，爱国的广大僧俗人民，不愿意离开祖国的怀抱，英勇地起来斗争，用落后的鸣火枪、掷石子对付最凶狠的侵略军。当时反侵略之火熊熊燃烧，反侵略的声音撼天动地。英国侵略者伪称讲和而把江孜的两名代本杀死，而且把江孜的很多僧俗人民当场屠杀，血流成河。这些烈士的鲜血灌溉了西藏的土地，他们用鲜血保卫了祖国的西藏。
    在以后的日子里，英帝国主义者在西藏的一切侵略活动都受到藏族人民的反抗。英帝国主义在拉萨和江孜有驻军和专员，他们的一举一动，都遭到藏族人民的白眼。见了他们有人吐口水，有人念恶咒。英帝国主义为了想培养一些奴才曾在拉萨的仲吉林卡设立一所学校。藏族人民讨厌这所学校到了极点。当那些英国“教员”出现在大街小巷时，人们就在他们身后唱道：“老师是英国大鼻子鬼，学生是我们的眼中钉。”这两句歌直到现在还流传在拉萨的市民中间。英帝国主义者后来被迫停止了办这个奴才学校的计划。
    上述事实表明，西藏人民是热爱祖国的。西藏人民是仇视帝国主义的。帝国主义及其走狗的一切阴谋诡计都在西藏人民的雪亮眼睛下面和斗争中破产了。西藏广大劳动人民处在世界上最黑暗的封建农奴制社会里，为了彻底解放，求得幸福生活，只有在中国共产党领导下，走社会主义道路。但是原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团总是千方百计抵抗中央方针，对于西藏人民如饥似渴的民主改革的愿望一再阻拦，今年3月竟公然勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，纠集西藏各地叛匪，发起武装叛乱。企图永远保持不劳而获的寄生虫生活。
    与反动的叛国集团及其主子的愿望完全相反，西藏从此获得了新生，一个民主的社会主义新西藏即将实现，我们西藏将永远摆脱农奴制枷锁，与祖国各兄弟民族一道，共同建设祖国社会主义大家庭。我们都是在党的培养和教育下的藏族青年，一定为了新西藏的革命和建设，贡献自己的全部力量！
