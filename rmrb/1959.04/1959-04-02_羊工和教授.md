    Sheep Worker and Professor
    By our reporter Ma Ming
    In early March, when I revisited Ning Huatang, an old sheep worker in Wayaoshang, Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, he and the other sheep workers were busy preparing for the spring lambing season.

    Ning Huatang excitedly told me that this year, more ewes were pregnant with twins than in previous years, and the plan to have ewes give birth to triplets would soon be realized. The intensive breeding of sheep brings many new tasks for the herders: twenty more sheep pens are needed to keep the newborn lambs warm; to compensate for the ewes' insufficient milk supply, a large amount of artificial milk and crude chlortetracycline feed needs to be prepared, and more nursing staff are needed. I was surprised that during my first visit last fall, the news of a few ewes giving birth to twins was still considered a rare event. Only one winter has passed since then, and now a large number of ewes will be able to give birth to twins and triplets. How was this achieved?

          New Methods for New Matters

    The story is as follows:

    Last September, Associate Professor Lü Xiaowu and teaching assistants Li Zhenying and Wu Dehu from the Animal Husbandry Department of Shanxi Agricultural College came to Wayaoshang, just in time for the sheep breeding season. For this breeding, Ning Huatang had purchased eight excellent rams in advance and formulated a plan for each ewe to produce twins. However, he felt insecure because he lacked new technical measures to achieve the plan. Lü Xiaowu intended to promote the new technology of injecting pregnant mare serum to promote estrus and increase lambing. However, after arriving here, he heard that there were very few mares in estrus, and felt that this method was also unreliable. Finally, the four of them decided that Ning Huatang should first introduce in detail how he discovered the secret of ewes producing twins, and how he gradually transformed the accidental phenomenon of sheep mating blindly into preliminary artificial control. He had also explored the objective laws of needing to gain autumn fat and conduct double and repeat mating to produce twins. On the one hand, Lü Xiaowu took the scientific principles summarized and elevated from Ning Huatang's practical experience and explained them back to Ning Huatang, enabling him to elevate his original perceptual knowledge to a theoretical level of understanding. On the other hand, he also pointed out the shortcomings in Ning Huatang's breeding experience and jointly studied improvements with Ning Huatang. For example, in the past, Ning Huatang's experience of ewes producing twins was to adapt to the estrus and double and repeat mating patterns to ensure that each mature egg had a chance to be fertilized, using artificial assistance to allow sheep to mate naturally. This was a great improvement over allowing sheep to mate blindly in the past, but it was not yet completely controlled by planned artificial intervention. After repeated research by the two experts, one local and one foreign, they finally agreed to adopt artificial integrated insemination and multiple insemination breeding methods, which retained the basic content of Ning Huatang's original double and repeat mating experience and supplemented the part of artificial insemination that was lacking in Ning Huatang's experience.

    In order to do a good job in artificial integrated insemination and multiple insemination, Lü Xiaowu and the two teaching assistants personally renovated and whitewashed an original sheep pen and turned it into a clean and hygienic operating room and insemination room. Teaching assistant Li Zhenying also traveled four hundred li to Shanxi Agricultural College to retrieve a set of artificial insemination equipment. In this way, a goat artificial insemination station was born in Wayaoshang. Here, sheep workers, professors, and teaching assistants persisted for more than twenty days, from morning to night, and completed the breeding task for five hundred and twenty-six ewes.

        The Old Sheep Worker's Interest

    Ning Huatang now leads the sheep flock work of the Wayaoshang Production Brigade of the Taishan People's Commune. The number of sheep in his flock has increased from several hundred last year to more than 18,000. Since the Party Committee of Shanxi Agricultural College sent professors and teaching assistants to help with the work, his enthusiasm has grown. Take learning artificial insemination for example:

    From semen collection to insemination, from mastering temperature and pressure to sterilizing equipment, it requires learning quite complex operating techniques, which is very difficult for an old sheep worker who is illiterate and has been herding sheep for forty years. At first, even he himself lacked confidence. After he understood that this new technology could guarantee sheep breed improvement and intensive breeding, his interest in learning grew stronger. He carefully observed how Lü Xiaowu used the equipment to operate, and repeatedly asked Lü Xiaowu for advice. Lü Xiaowu explained the operating methods to him, and also held his hand to teach him the technology of goat artificial insemination. After half a month of painstaking study, he finally mastered the operating techniques of artificial insemination and began to work wearing a white coat.

    According to Lü Xiaowu's suggestion, he also improved the hygiene of the sheep pens and conducted comparative tests on several drugs to induce estrus in all ewes, that is, to number all the ewes that had used drugs to induce estrus one by one, and carefully observe which drug had a good effect on inducing estrus and producing more lambs when lambing.

    Ning Huatang also had a small setback in accepting new sheep raising techniques. At first, he did not believe in injections, thinking that they were not good for the sheep, and he also doubted whether goats could give birth twice a year. The reason was that he had seen sheep develop festering sores after being injected. Regarding this, Lü Xiaowu told him that it was due to improper disinfection during injection or errors in the preparation of drugs, and not the problem of the injection itself. He also demonstrated the actual operation for him to see. He believed it and quickly learned how to use the syringe. As for the problem of ewes giving birth twice a year, he carefully calculated that each pregnancy requires five months, and two births a year would mean ten months of pregnancy, which would be too tiring for the ewes. If they all produced twins, not only would the time be tight, but the milk would not be enough for the lambs. What should be done? Later, he learned that giving birth twice a year had been successfully tested in Xinjiang. He thought of the similar phenomenon of large livestock being bred twice a year in the local area, and saw Lü Xiaowu's repeated successful experiments on hot mating (i.e., two matings) of domestic rabbits. Finally, he figured it out. To achieve two births a year, it is necessary to do a good job in artificial estrus induction, hot mating, early weaning of lambs, and strengthening artificial milk and chlortetracycline feeding. In this way, the new contradiction was resolved, and sheep breeding could also be planned and controlled artificially.

      The Professor's Unexpected Harvest

    People may not imagine that Lü Xiaowu would take Ning Huatang as his teacher. When he first came to Wayaoshang to learn from the local expert, he still had a knot in his mind: on the one hand, he felt that Ning Huatang's forty years of sheep herding experience was rich and valuable, but on the other hand, he felt that his experience was piecemeal, fragmented, and unremarkable. This old professor, who had been studying and lecturing in the animal husbandry department of the university for more than twenty years, began to embark on the road of combining theory and practice with such contradictory and complex feelings.

    In Wayaoshang, Lü Xiaowu and the two teaching assistants lived, ate, and worked together with Ning Huatang and other sheep workers. They followed the sheep flock to graze on the mountains, and repeatedly asked Ning Huatang to explain his four seasons of grazing experience on the grazing site. After this practical learning for the past half a year, Lü Xiaowu has realized that his original idea was wrong, and realized that Ning Huatang has accumulated many systematic and complete experiences in grazing, breeding, lamb rearing, identification, local disease treatment, weather forecasting, and maintaining the sheep flock in the fight against natural disasters. These experiences cannot be learned from the old sheep raising books.

    From learning Ning Huatang's sheep grazing experience, Lü Xiaowu not only increased his perceptual knowledge, enriched the theory of sheep raising, and gained a deeper understanding of the theory he had learned in the past, but also broke his blind faith in some of the outdated arguments of the old sheep raising science. The old sheep raising science determined that rams with a single testicle have less and weaker sperm, and are generally not used as breeding rams, and rams with undescended testicles must not be used as breeding rams. However, the joint practice of Ning Huatang and local sheep workers proves that rams with a single testicle can not only be used as breeding rams, but also the lambs they produce are mostly ewes. One year, among the one hundred ewes mated by a ram with a single testicle, sixty to seventy lambs were ewes. Lü Xiaowu believes that such experience can be scientifically summarized to open up a reliable path for artificially controlling the sex of sheep.

    When I visited Lü Xiaowu, he said that his biggest gain was overcoming dogmatism in teaching. In the past, he could only explain according to the articles in the book, and could not specifically connect with reality. Shanxi Province has many mountains and is a mountain pasture, with many differences in terrain, topography, and sheep's living habits. However, the content of the lectures in the past was abstract and empty. Most of them were based on the book and only talked about the experience of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia and the plains. Ning Huatang's experience of ewes producing twins is very important for promoting sheep breeding, but there is no such thing in the book. Learning from Ning Huatang's experience, he realized the importance of practice, and that theory comes from practice. He also recognized the correctness of the Party's call for "the able are teachers" and "combining indigenous and foreign methods." Originally, Lü Xiaowu and Ning Huatang were completely unfamiliar with each other, but now no one can do without the other.

    Now, Lü Xiaowu and Li Zhenying and Wu Dehu have compiled three books based on the sheep herding experience collected from Ning Huatang: "Ning Huatang's Sheep Herding Experience," "How to Make Ewes Give Birth to More Lambs," and "One Hundred Sheep Herding Songs." They will be published soon, and the entire book of 250,000 words in six chapters, "Chinese Sheep Raising Science," is being drafted. Three chapters have already been completed and will continue to be supplemented and revised.

    Feelings of mutual learning are intertwined

    The deeds of Ning Huatang and Lü Xiaowu, these two sheep raising experts who combined with each other, attract people. People know that they have different backgrounds and experiences, and originally had different views on certain issues of sheep raising. However, they are both Communist Party members, have the common ideal of developing socialist sheep raising, and especially under the guidance of the Party's correct policy of "the able are teachers" and "combining indigenous and foreign methods," they have united these two experts, one local and one foreign. This has made the feelings of mutual learning and striving for the other party to learn everything they have always intertwined in the days they spent together. (Attached pictures)

    羊工和教授
    本报记者　马明
    3月初，当我再次访问山西省晋城县瓦窑上老羊工宁华堂时，他和羊工们正在繁忙地进行着春季接羔的准备工作。
    宁华堂首先兴奋地告诉我：今年母羊比往年怀了更多的双羔，一胎产三羔的计划，马上就要实现。羊的密集繁殖，给牧工带来许多新的工作：增加二十间羊房，才能使新生的小羊御寒；为补救母羊的奶水不足，需要赶制大量的人工奶、粗制金霉素饲料和增加哺乳的护理人员。使我惊奇的是，去年秋天第一次来这里访问的时候，人们还把少数母羊一胎产双羔的消息，当作珍闻传播。从那时起到现在，中间只隔一冬，而大批母羊将能一胎产双羔和一胎产三羔了。这是怎样达到的呢？
          新事新办
    事情的经过是这样的：
    去年9月，山西农学院畜牧系副教授吕效吾和助教李振英、武德虎来到瓦窑上，正好碰上羊群的配种季节。为配种这件事，宁华堂事前购买了八只优良公羊，并且制订了头头母羊产双羔的计划。但是，缺乏实现计划的新技术措施，使他心里很不落实。吕效吾打算推行注射孕马血清的新技术，促进母羊发情、多产羔。可是来到这里以后，听说发情的母马很少，觉得这种办法也完全靠不住。最后四个人商量的结果，决定先由宁华堂详细介绍他是怎样发现母羊产双羔的秘密，又怎样使原来由羊盲目交配的偶然现象，逐步变成由人工初步控制，而且摸索到配双羔必须先抓秋膘和进行双配复配的客观规律。吕效吾一方面把从宁华堂的实际经验中，总结提高起来的科学原理，反回来再讲给宁华堂听，使他能够对自己原有的感性知识，上升到理论高度去理解。另一方面，也提出宁华堂配种经验中不足的地方，和宁华堂共同研究改进。比如过去宁华堂母羊产双羔的经验，是适应羊的发情和双配复配使每个成熟卵子都有授精机会的规律，经过人工辅助使羊进行自然交配。这比过去听任羊的盲目自然交配有了很大进步，但是它还没有完全被有计划的人工所控制。两位土洋专家经过反复的研究，最后商定：采取人工综合授精和多次授精的配种方法，既保留了宁华堂原有双配复配经验的基本内容，又补充了宁华堂经验中不足的人工授精部分。
    为了做好人工综合授精和多次授精的工作，吕效吾和两位助教亲自动手，把一所原来的羊房，整修、粉刷，改成了清洁卫生的操作室和输精室。助教李振英又往返跑到四百里以外的山西农学院取来一套人工授精器械。就这样一所山羊人工授精站在瓦窑上诞生了。在这里，羊工、教授和助教从早到晚，坚持了二十多天，完成了给五百二十六只母羊的配种任务。
        老羊工的兴趣
    宁华堂现在领导泰山人民公社瓦窑上生产大队的羊群工作，有羊工二十三人，放牧的羊群已经由去年的几百只增加到一万八千多只。自从中共山西农学院党委会派来教授、助教帮助工作以后，他的劲头越来越大了。就从学习人工授精来说吧：
    从采精到输精，从掌握温度、压力到器械消毒，需要学习相当复杂的操作技术，这对一个一字不识，放羊四十年的老羊工来说，是很困难的。开始连他自己的信心也不足。当他懂得这种新技术能够保证羊种改良和羊的密集繁殖的道理以后，学习的兴趣就浓厚起来。他仔细地观察吕效吾是怎样使用器械操作，还一次又一次地请教吕效吾，吕效吾一面给他讲解操作方法，一面又用手握着他的手，教给他山羊人工授精的技术。经过半月的苦心钻研，他终于初步掌握了人工授精的操作技术，开始穿上白色工作服工作了。
    按照吕效吾的建议，他还改善了羊圈的卫生，并且对全部母羊进行了几种药物促情的比较试验，这就是把所有使用过药物促情的母羊一一编号，在产羔时仔细察看哪种药物促情多产羔的效果良好。
    宁华堂在接受新的养羊技术上，也有过一段小波折。一开始，他对注射就不相信，认为对羊没有好处，对山羊一年能产二次也表示怀疑。理由是，他看到过羊在注射以后，身上长了浓疮。对这一点，吕效吾告诉他，那是注射时消毒不严密，或者配用药物发生差错，并不是注射本身的毛病。又实际操作做出样子让他看。他相信了，很快就学会注射器的使用方法。至于母羊一年产两次羔的问题，他仔细计算过母羊每胎需要怀五个月，一年产两次，一年就有十个月的怀孕期，母羊太累了，如果都产了双羔，不但时间紧迫，奶也不够小羊吃，这怎么办呢？后来，他知道一年产两次羔已经在新疆试验成功，想到当地大牲畜也有一年配种两次的类似现象，又看到吕效吾对家兔热配（即两次交配）的反复试验成功。最后，想通了。要做到一年产两次羔，就要做好人工促情、热配，让小羊提前断奶和加强人工乳、粗制金霉素的哺乳工作。这样，新的矛盾解决了，羊的繁殖也可以有计划的由人工控制了。
      教授的意外收获
    人们也许想像不到，吕效吾拜宁华堂为师。他初来瓦窑上向土专家学习的时候，思想上还结着一个疙瘩：一面感觉到宁华堂放羊四十年的经验丰富宝贵，一面又觉得他的经验点滴、片断、零碎，没有什么了不起。这位在大学畜牧系已经学习、讲课二十多年的老教授，就是在这样矛盾复杂的心情下，开始踏上理论和实践相结合的道路的。
    在瓦窑上，吕效吾和两个助教，同宁华堂与其他羊工在一起，同吃同住同劳动。他们跟随羊群上山放牧，特别是在放牧的现场再三请宁华堂讲解他的四季放羊经验。经过最近半年的这种实际学习，吕效吾已经察觉出他原来的想法是错了，认识到宁华堂从长期的牧羊的实践中，已经在放牧、配种、育羔、鉴定、土法治病、预测气候和维护羊群向自然灾害斗争方面，积累了许多系统、完整的经验。这些经验，都是从旧养羊学的书本上学不到的。
    吕效吾从学习宁华堂的放羊经验中，不但增长了许多感性知识，充实了养羊学的理论，使过去学到的理论有较深的理解，而且破除了他对旧养羊学的某些陈腐论调的迷信。旧养羊学断定：单睪公羊精虫少精虫弱，一般不作种羊，阴睪公羊绝对不能作种羊，而在宁华堂和当地羊工的共同实践证明：单睪公羊不仅可以作种羊，而且配生的羊羔多数是母羔。有一年宁华堂用单睪公羊所配的一百只母羊中，有六十至七十只羊羔是母羊。吕效吾认为这种经验加以科学的总结，就能给人为的控制羊的性别，打开一条可靠的道路。
    我访问吕效吾的时候，他说他的最大收获，就是在教学中克服了教条主义，过去只能照书本条文讲解，而不能具体联系实际。山西省山多，是山地牧场，地势、地形和羊的生活习性都有许多不同。但是，过去讲课的内容抽象空洞，绝大部分是按书本只讲新疆、内蒙古地区和平原地区的经验。宁华堂母羊产双羔的经验，对促进羊的繁殖很重要，可是书本上没有这一条，学习宁华堂的经验，才认识到实践的重要，理论是从实践中产生，认识到党所提出的“能者为师”、“土洋结合”的正确。原来，吕效吾和宁华堂完全生疏，现在是谁也离不开谁了。
    现在，吕效吾和李振英、武德虎，已经根据收集到宁华堂的牧羊经验，编写了“宁华堂牧羊经验”、“怎样使母羊多下羔”和“牧羊歌诀百首”三本书。不久即可出版，正在着手起草的全书二十五万字共分六章的“中国养羊学”，已经有三章脱稿，将要继续补充、修改。
    互相学习的心情交织在一起
    宁华堂和吕效吾，这两位养羊专家相互结合的事迹吸引着人们。人们知道他俩有着不同出身、经历，原来在养羊的某些问题上有不同的见解，但是，他们都是共产党员，具有发展社会主义养羊事业的共同理想，特别是在党的“能者为师”、“土洋结合”的正确方针指引下，又把这两位土洋专家统一起来。这就使他们在相处的日子里，激动着互相学习而又力争对方学到自己所有一切的心情，始终交织在一起。（附图片）
