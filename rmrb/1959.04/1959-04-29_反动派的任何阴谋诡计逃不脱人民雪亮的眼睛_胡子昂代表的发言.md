Chairman, fellow representatives, fellow committee members:

    I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. I cheer for the Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan with soaring enthusiasm and creative labor, and achieved the unprecedented Great Leap Forward in 1958.

    Seeing the Abundant Harvest Scene, My Heart is Filled with Joy, and I Must Serve Practically and Contribute More Forcefully

    In the past ten years, in our country, everything I have seen with my own eyes and everywhere my feet have stepped has been constantly changing and developing. It is truly changing with each passing day, which makes me feel extremely excited. I lived in Chongqing for many years. In the past, under the rule of warlords and reactionary governments, taxes became more and more numerous, and levies became heavier and heavier. The ditches were filled with sewage, and rats swarmed everywhere. There was never any construction to speak of. Today, after ten years of liberation, factories have sprung up everywhere, the city has a completely new look, the city is clean and tidy, and the whole city is greened. It has become an industrial city and a beautiful garden city. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Sichuan had dreamed of for decades, became a reality in a few years, and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was extended, passing through Guangyuan and the Qinling Mountains. Many foreign friends came to visit and exclaimed that it was a miracle of the world. For thousands of years, people always said "the road to Shu is difficult," but from now on, it will no longer be difficult for the Chinese people. In the past year or two, I also visited the Yangtze River Bridge and visited the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, the Heavy Machinery Plant, the Lanzhou Oil Refinery, the Fertilizer Plant, the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, etc. I saw thousands of oil pipes, a long flow of molten steel, and countless original components. The products are really new. I have also been to Guizhou, a remote area that used to be called "no three sunny days in the sky, no three feet of flat land, and no three cents of silver for the people," but now it is gradually becoming a modern industrial base. I used to work in industry, and the miserable scene of old China's industry is still fresh in my memory. However, today, thousands of factories have been built everywhere. Many precision machines that could not be manufactured in the past can now be manufactured by ourselves. Many cutting-edge industries that were unimaginable in the past have also been established one by one. I have also visited the people's communes in Zhengzhou and Xushui, and everywhere is filled with socialist songs. When I visited the Xushui People's Commune, I compared heights with many people under a "corn tree" that grew more than thirty ears of corn, and counted the cotton bolls under a cotton tree that grew two hundred and dozens of cotton bolls. Seeing this abundant harvest scene, my heart is truly filled with infinite joy. All of these are just some fragmented impressions that I have personally come into contact with. Compared with the entire great achievements of our country, they are just a drop in the ocean. However, thinking of these things cannot help but make people happy and encouraged, and their spirits lifted. Who brought us such happy days? Who pointed us to such a bright future? We cannot but thank the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we cannot but be filled with a sense of patriotism and unlimited confidence in the future from the bottom of our hearts.

    In this meeting, a construction plan for 1959 with a higher speed and a more magnificent scale has been presented to us. Mobilizing all forces to fully complete and overfulfill this magnificent plan, uniting, uniting more closely, leaping forward, leaping forward on a larger scale, is the task of the people of the whole country. As a member of the industrial and commercial circles and a member of the China Democratic National Construction Association, I deeply feel that this is also the task of every industrialist and businessman. We must contribute our humble opinions and skills, and at the same time regard it as our greatest honor. Many of us in the industrial and commercial circles have certain production technology and management knowledge. The Party and the state have long pointed out that if they can be correctly utilized, it is a wealth of the country; the Party and the state have also taken various measures so that we can work with peace of mind, transform ourselves with peace of mind, and fully exert our strength. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the workers, we have received a lot of education and training. In particular, through the anti-Rightist rectification movement, we have made progress to varying degrees in political thought and have done some work and made certain contributions to the national construction cause. Some people have also made relatively significant achievements. Now is a great time for us to contribute more forcefully and play a role. We must immediately get started, muster our energy, make full use of our knowledge and talents, humbly learn from the working people, and make as many contributions as possible to the national construction cause. We industrialists and businessmen are patriotic, and to be patriotic is to love socialism. We must firmly follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Party and be determined to serve socialism for the rest of our lives, and strengthen our self-education and self-transformation in active service, and better combine service and transformation, and gradually transform ourselves into workers. Only by mustering our energy, serving practically, and accumulating over time to break the capitalist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, and establish socialist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods in socialist work positions and labor and other practical activities can we completely realize our fundamental transformation; and only by gradually transforming our political standpoints and thoughts can we contribute our technology and experience on the basis of constantly improving our consciousness and play a better role in serving socialism. We know that on our road to socialism, knowledge and practice, transformation and service, are unified and inseparable. There is no distinction between importance and difficulty between them, and they influence and promote each other. Any ideas and practices that oppose or separate the two are wrong.

    Accept the Leadership of the Party Wholeheartedly and Continue to Move Forward on the Road of Self-Transformation

    How can we industrialists and businessmen achieve strengthening transformation in active service? I think the most ordinary but most fundamental issue is to accept the leadership of the Party without reservation. We have all gone through ten years under the leadership and education of the Party. Countless facts have proved that since the Communist Party came, a prosperous atmosphere has been created everywhere in New China. Where there is the leadership of the Party, there is a constant move from victory to victory. As far as our industrial and commercial circles are concerned, for ten years, the Party has consistently adopted a policy of peaceful transformation, not only giving us the same political status as the people of the whole country in politics, but also giving us appropriate care in the economy and life; any positive performance in socialist transformation and socialist construction is affirmed and encouraged, while negative thoughts and behaviors are patiently educated, and we are constantly promoted to conduct self-education and self-transformation, helping us to gradually abandon capitalist positions and thoughts, to align with socialism, and to gradually move towards the road of socialism. The only problem is whether we are honest and sincere, accepting the leadership of the Party wholeheartedly, or half-hearted? From my own personal experience, these years of recollection show that the Party is concerned about us, teaching us, and earnestly hoping that we will strengthen transformation and make contributions all the time. If we have made a little bit of progress, it is all due to the Party's concern, education, and training. Facts have proved that as long as we industrialists and businessmen accept the leadership of the Party wholeheartedly, we can continuously move forward on the road of self-transformation, and we can do our work well in the socialist work positions. The Party represents the truth, and the Party is our lighthouse. As long as we sincerely lean towards the Party, we can get the Party's education, help, and trust. We see that hundreds of millions of working people across the country are connected to the Party by flesh and blood and breathe the same air. Under the leadership of the Party, they have exerted soaring energy in the Great Leap Forward, generated the power to overturn mountains and seas, and made great contributions to the socialist construction cause. They express their love for the Party and socialism with the vivid language of "the Party is the eyeball, and the commune is the lifeline." Their noble spirit and style are really worthy of our good learning. Now, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, an infinitely beautiful and bright future has been unfolded before our eyes, and an era of great brilliance is calling us to contribute to socialism. We industrialists and businessmen must, together with the people of the whole country, actively respond to all the calls of the Party and the state, revitalize our spirits, immediately throw ourselves into the magnificent movement of increasing production and practicing economy, actively offer suggestions and techniques, participate in the technological revolution, and dedicate all our useful knowledge and talents to the great motherland, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 construction plan, and greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland.

    Certain Self-Interested Politicians in India, Willing to Inherit the Mantle of Imperialism, Will Inevitably Suffer a Shameful Defeat

    Just as the people of all ethnic groups in our country are united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, constantly leaping forward and building our great motherland, reactionary elements at home and abroad are trying every possible means to sabotage us. Recently, a small group of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, under the instigation of imperialism and foreign reactionaries, launched an armed rebellion, attempting to split our motherland and undermine the unity of our various ethnic groups; they also repeatedly fabricated so-called statements by the Dalai Lama, distorting the facts and reversing black and white. It is worth noting that this so-called statement was distributed by Indian diplomatic officials, and at the same time, some Indian and foreign reactionary newspapers took the opportunity to spread rumors and slander our country. These facts once again prove that the heinous activities of this small group of reactionary traitors are the conspiracies and plans of imperialism and Indian expansionist elements. We feel great indignation at this. We resolutely support the various measures proposed by Premier Zhou in his report on quelling the Tibetan rebellion. This is China's internal affair and no one is allowed to interfere in it. Tibet is a part of our country's sacred territory. At present, some imperialist and Indian expansionist elements are colluding with a small group of traitors in Tibet, doing unspeakable deeds. We must solemnly warn them that no matter what conspiracies and tricks you play, you cannot escape the sharp eyes of the Chinese people. The Chinese people who have stood up must thoroughly eliminate the Tibetan bandits and must smash all the conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad; we are fully capable of thoroughly eliminating the Tibetan bandits, and we are fully capable of thoroughly smashing all the conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad. Now, certain Indian politicians have adopted a very ambiguous and even openly supportive attitude towards the Tibetan traitors, condoning them to carry out various political activities against our country in India, and even violating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India, attempting to interfere in our country's internal affairs. Their behavior of abandoning righteousness for profit has aroused the righteous anger of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have always cherished the deep friendship between the Chinese and Indian people and are determined not to allow a few self-interested people to undermine our friendship. Moreover, in fact, if these self-interested Indian politicians do not stop in time, willingly inherit the mantle of imperialism, they will certainly not get the support of the people and will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. Let the reactionary elements at home and abroad continue to daydream! Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in our country must unite even better and build the country even better. Our great motherland will forever stand like a giant in the world.

    反动派的任何阴谋诡计逃不脱人民雪亮的眼睛
    胡子昂代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告，并为我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，以冲天的干劲和创造性的劳动，胜利地完成了第一个五年计划，实现了史无前例的一九五八年的大跃进而欢呼。
    看到丰产景象，心里无限欢乐，要踏踏实实服务，更好地贡献力量
    十年来，在我们的国家里，从我两眼所看到的一事一物，两脚踏过的一切地方，都在不断的变化、不断的发展，真是日新月异，令人感到无比兴奋。我在重庆住过多年，过去在军阀和反动政府统治下，税是越来越多，捐是越来越重，臭水满沟，老鼠成群，从来没有过什么建设可说。在解放十年的今天，已经工厂林立，面目一新，市容整洁，全城绿化，成为一个工业城市，同时又是一座美丽的花园城市了。四川人民几十年来梦寐以求的成渝铁路，几年间变成了现实，并延修了宝成铁路，出广元，通过了秦岭天险，许多外国朋友来此参观，都叹为人间的奇迹。千百年来总说“蜀道难”，从此再也难不倒我国人民了。我在这一、二年间还到过长江大桥，参观过武汉钢铁厂、重型机器厂、兰州炼油厂、化肥厂、北京电子管厂等等，看到了油管万千，钢水长流，看到了无数创制的机件，真是产品翻新。我还到过贵州，过去所谓“天无三日晴，地无三尺平，人无三分银”的偏远地区，而今也逐渐成为一个现代工业的基地。我过去是干过工业的，旧中国的工业凄惨景象记忆犹新，但是，今天已经到处兴建起成千上万的工厂，过去不会制造的精密机器，现在很多都能够自己制造了，过去梦想不到的许多尖端工业，也一一建立起来了。我还访问过郑州、徐水的人民公社，到处洋溢着社会主义的歌声，我在参观徐水人民公社的时候，同很多人在一棵生长三十几个玉米的“玉米树”下比过高低，在一棵生长二百几十个棉桃的棉树下数过棉桃。看到这种丰产气象，心里真是无限的欢乐。所有这些，仅仅是我个人所接触到的一些片断的观感，同我们国家整个伟大成就比较起来，不过是沧海之一粟。但是，一想到这些，就不禁使人欢欣鼓舞，精神振奋。是谁给我们带来这样幸福的日子？是谁给我们指引这样美好的前途呢？不能不感谢中国共产党和毛主席领导的英明、正确，不能不使我们从心底里充满了爱国主义的自豪感和对未来的无限信心。
    在这次会议中，一个速度更高、规模更加宏伟的一九五九年建设计划又呈现在我们的眼前。调动一切力量，全面完成和超额完成这个宏伟的计划，团结，更加紧密地团结，跃进，更大规模地跃进，是我们全国人民的任务。作为工商界的一分子和一个民主建国会的成员，我深切地感觉到，这也是我们每一个工商业者的任务，我们一定要贡献我们的一得之见和一技之长，同时把它当作我们莫大的光荣。我们工商界中的很多人，是具有一定的生产技术和经营管理知识的，党和国家早已指出，如果能够正确地发挥出来，是国家的一笔财富；党和国家并且采取了种种措施，使我们可以安心工作，安心改造，来充分发挥自己的力量。几年来，我们在党的领导和职工群众的帮助下，受到了许多的教育和锻炼，特别是通过了反右整风运动，在政治思想上都有不同程度的进步，在国家建设事业中做了一定的工作，有了一定的贡献，有些人还做出了比较显著的成绩。现在正是我们更好地贡献力量，发挥作用的大好时光，我们一定要立即上马，鼓足干劲，充分利用自己的知识和才能，虚心向劳动人民学习，为国家建设事业作出尽可能多的贡献。我们工商业者是爱国的，爱国就要爱社会主义，我们一定要在党的领导下坚定地走社会主义的道路，决心一辈子为社会主义服务，并且在积极服务中加强自我教育和自我改造，把服务和改造更好地结合起来，逐步把自己改造成为一个劳动者。只有在社会主义工作岗位上以及劳动和其他各项实践中鼓足干劲，踏踏实实地服务，日积月累地破资本主义的立场、观点和方法，立社会主义的立场、观点和方法，我们才能够彻底实现我们根本的改造；也只有逐步改造我们的政治立场和思想，才能够使我们在不断提高自觉的基础上，贡献出我们的技术和经验，在为社会主义服务方面发挥更好的作用。我们知道，在我们走向社会主义的道路上，认识与实践、改造与服务，是统一而不可分割的，它们之间并没有轻重之分，也没有难易之别，是互相影响，互相推动的。积极服务是加强改造的主要基础，而加强改造又是积极服务的必要条件，任何把二者对立起来或割裂开来的想法和做法，都是不对的。
    一心一意地接受党的领导，在自我改造的道路上继续前进
    我们工商业者究竟怎样才能做到在积极服务中加强改造呢？我认为一个最平凡但是最根本的问题，就是要不折不扣地接受党的领导。我们大家在党的领导和教育下，已经经过了十年，无数事实证明，自从来了共产党，新中国就到处产生出一片兴旺的气象。那里有了党的领导，那里就不断地从胜利走向胜利。就我们工商界来说，十年来，党一贯采取和平改造的政策，不仅在政治上给予我们同全国人民一样的政治地位，而且在经济上、生活上也一直加以适当的照顾；对于我们在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中的任何积极表现，都加以肯定和鼓励，对于消极思想和行为，则是耐心教育，不断地推动我们进行自我教育和自我改造，帮助我们逐步抛弃资本主义立场和思想，向社会主义挂钩，逐步走向社会主义的道路。唯一的问题，在于我们自己究竟是忠诚老实，一心一意，来接受党的领导呢？还是三心二意？从我自己的切身感受来说，这些年来的回忆，党无时无地不在关怀我们，教导我们，殷切希望我们加强改造，作出贡献，如果说我们有一点一滴的进步，都是由于党的关切、教育和培养所得来的。事实证明，我们工商业者只要一心一意接受党的领导，就能够在自我改造道路上不断地前进，就能够使我们在社会主义的工作岗位上做好我们的工作。党代表了真理，党是我们的灯塔，只要我们真心诚意地向党靠拢，就能够得到党的教育、帮助和信任。我们看到，全国几亿劳动人民对党是血肉相连、呼吸相通的，他们在党的领导下，在大跃进中发挥了冲天的干劲，产生出倒山倒海的力量，在社会主义建设事业中作出了伟大的贡献。他们以“党是眼珠子，社是命根子”的生动语言，来表达对党、对社会主义的热爱。他们这种高尚的精神和风格，实在值得我们很好的学习。现在，我们的国家在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，一个无限美好的光明前景已经展现在我们的眼前，光芒万丈的时代在召唤着我们为社会主义做出贡献。我们工商界一定要和全国人民一道，积极响应党和国家的一切号召，抖擞精神，立即投入波澜壮阔的增产节约运动，积极地献计献技，参加技术革命，把我们一切有用的知识和才能全部献给伟大的祖国，为完成和超额完成一九五九年建设计划，迎接我们伟大祖国建国十周年而奋斗。
    印度某些别有用心的政治家们，甘心承继帝国主义的衣钵，一定会遭到可耻的失败
    正当我们全国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，团结一致，不断跃进，建设我们伟大的祖国的时候，国内外反动分子却在千方百计地设法破坏我们。最近西藏一小撮上层反动分子在帝国主义和外国反动派的策动下，发动武装叛乱，企图分裂我们的祖国，破坏我们各民族的团结；还一再制造所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，歪曲事实，颠倒黑白。值得注意的是，这个所谓声明是由印度外交官员散发的，同时，一些印度和外国反动报纸也乘机大肆造谣，诬蔑我国。这些事实，再一次证明了这一小撮反动叛国分子的罪恶活动，是帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的阴谋和策划。我们对此感到极大的愤慨。我们坚决拥护周总理在报告中提出的关于平息西藏叛乱的各项措施，这是中国的内政，决不容许任何人横加干涉。西藏是我国神圣领土的一部分，目前帝国主义和印度的一些扩张主义分子正在和西藏的一小撮叛国分子勾勾搭搭，干着不可告人的勾当。我们必须严正警告他们，无论你们玩什么阴谋诡计，都逃不了中国人民雪亮的眼睛，站起来了的中国人民一定要彻底肃清西藏的叛匪，一定要粉碎一切国内外敌人的阴谋；我们完全有力量彻底肃清西藏的叛匪，我们完全有力量彻底粉碎一切国内外敌人的阴谋。现在，某些印度政治家对于西藏叛国分子采取了十分暧昧甚至公开支持的态度，纵容他们在印度进行种种反对我国的政治活动，竟不惜违反中印两国所共同提倡的和平共处五项原则，企图干涉我国的内政，他们这种见利忘义的行为，已经激起了我国人民正义的愤怒。我国人民一向珍惜中印人民深厚的友谊，决不愿意让少数别有用心的人来破坏我们的友谊，而且事实上，如果这些别有用心的印度政治家们，不及时罢手，甘心承继帝国主义的衣钵，一定不会得到人民的支持，一定会遭到可耻的失败。让国内外反动分子们尽管去白日作梦吧！我国各族人民一定要在中国共产党的领导下，团结得更好，把国家建设得更好。我们伟大的祖国将永远永远像巨人般屹立于世界。
