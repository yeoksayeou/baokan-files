Comrade Chairman, fellow deputies, fellow members,

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959," and the work reports made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen and Vice Chairman Li Weihan on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, respectively. I believe that any patriotic and sensible person who has heard these reports, seen the great achievements our country has made in all fields in the past ten years, especially during the first Five-Year Plan, and witnessed the comprehensive Great Leap Forward on all fronts of our country in 1958, will feel joyful and encouraged; will feel that the country is developing rapidly, that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are leading well, and that the superiority of the socialist system is unparalleled; and will greet the greater leap forward of 1959 with greater confidence and energy.
(Applause)

This year is a crucial year for the second Five-Year Plan in our country. Our national economic plan for 1959 is a plan for continuing the leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, a plan that is both ambitious and completely reliable. All the four major indicators and other indicators in the plan have been proposed after fully estimating the possibilities. Taking the steel production target as an example, the proposal to produce 18 million tons of steel this year actually exceeds 16 million tons based on the steelmaking capacity of only eighteen key enterprises. We know that the Great Leap Forward did not come out of thin air. If we had not had the great achievements of the first Five-Year Plan, the great victory of the anti-rightist and rectification movements, and the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, it would have been impossible to achieve such a huge leap forward as in 1958. Today, the objective conditions are even more favorable for us. On the basis of the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan, we have the rich experience and material and technical foundation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the grassroots social organization of the people's commune which can greatly promote production development, the increasingly improved ideological consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. This enables our 1959 plan targets to exceed last year in many aspects on a reliable basis. Although the percentage increase of some indicators may seem slightly lower than last year on the surface, the absolute numbers are still greatly increased. In our country, the Party and the government do everything from reality, and we do what we say. The great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 have given the so-called "wait-and-see faction" and "account-settling faction" a great lesson. If there are still "wait-and-see faction" and "account-settling faction" today, then the facts will certainly give them a better lesson.

Our national economic plan this year is the product of the Party and the state's general line for socialist construction. This plan fully embodies the Party's established policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously developing modern and indigenous methods of production, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry; it fully embodies the policy of taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward in industry; at the same time, it also embodies the objective law of planned and proportionate high-speed development of the national economy, and implements the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard." All of these are determined by the Party based on the specific circumstances of our current construction. Practice has proved that the policies and guidelines adopted by the Party have played and are playing unlimited power in our national construction. The development of various departments of the national economy is interdependent, mutually promoting, and mutually restricting. In the high-speed development of the national economy, there must be both emphasis and generality; both leap forward and balance. In the development of all things, balance is a temporary and relative phenomenon, while imbalance is a constant and absolute phenomenon. The balance we need is a balance in which the key points drive the general, and the advanced promote the backward; that is, on the basis of the rapid development of various economic sectors, we should take into account the proportional relationship between all aspects as much as possible, and constantly organize new balances; that is, a balance that implements the policy of "walking on two legs" and "the whole country as one chessboard." In high-speed development, temporary disconnections in certain aspects cannot be completely avoided and can be overcome. For example, in the Great Leap Forward in 1958, there was a shortage of certain commodities. From the perspective of consumers, this may be a shortcoming, but from the overall interests of the 600 million people, comparing it with the great achievements of the entire national leap forward, it is the relationship between nine fingers and one finger. We demand to constantly overcome shortcomings and constantly organize new balances, but we must never deny the achievements of the Great Leap Forward because of this, and we should not hinder the high-speed development of all aspects in order to pursue and maintain a mechanical balance. In fact, in our Great Leap Forward, the Party has long proposed the policy of the whole country as one chessboard, and all aspects have carried forward the spirit of communist cooperation. With the further development of the Great Leap Forward, there is no doubt that this spirit of communist cooperation will be greatly improved in 1959 and in the future. (Applause)

	Industrial and commercial people should combine accepting reform and actively serving socialism, and recognize that: without political and ideological reform, active service has no soul or direction; without active service, strengthening reform becomes empty talk.

Our plan this year is a plan to go all out, aim high, and achieve more, faster, better, and more economically. In order to better complete this plan, we must continue to implement the Party's policy of combining centralized leadership and mass movements. Over the past few years, under the leadership and education of the Party, our people have become increasingly aware of the greatness and correctness of the Party. This is because all the Party's lines, policies, and guidelines are completely in line with the greatest interests and demands of the people, and the spirit of the mass line has been implemented at all times and in all places. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the Party has conducted in-depth ideological education on socialism and communism among the broad masses of the people, and ideological education on the Party and the state's general line for socialist construction; hundreds of thousands of cadres have been sent to rural areas and grassroots industrial and mining enterprises to eat, live, and work with the masses; leading cadres at all levels regularly go to the countryside to be farmers and to workshops to be workers, appearing as ordinary laborers and becoming one with the masses; under the repeated teachings of the Party, many mass line work experiences and methods have also been created, such as cadres planting experimental fields, regularly holding meetings of cadres at all levels, and implementing two participations, one reform, and three combinations in industrial and mining enterprises, etc. This has formed a new atmosphere and ethos among the broad masses of the people, further strengthened the ties between cadres and the masses, and greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the working people. Wherever the Party points, they rush there. All instructions and calls of the Party, once they penetrate into the masses, become endless power. This soaring enthusiasm of the working people under the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for all work to go from victory to victory, and it is also the fundamental guarantee for realizing our greater leap forward in 1959.

In order to better comprehensively complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan, we must continue to strengthen political and ideological work. Political and ideological work is the foundation of all work. If politics takes command, everything will be easier. The Party has always attached great importance to ideological education. In fact, the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958 was the result of the national people, under the leadership of the Party, breaking superstitions, emancipating their minds, and working hard, practically, and skillfully on the basis of the victory of the national rectification movement and under the illumination of the Party and the state's general line for socialist construction. Everyone has seen that when the broad masses of the people responded to the Party's call, broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, and began to establish the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, thousands upon thousands of amazing miracles immediately appeared on the industrial and agricultural production fronts and other fronts, making the wave of the Great Leap Forward higher and higher. It can be seen from this that to have the action of a leap forward, we must first have the thought of a leap forward. To be able to achieve continuous leap forwards, we must continuously carry out political and ideological work in depth. It should be recognized that accelerating the construction of socialism and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism requires not only material conditions and foundations, but also spiritual conditions and foundations. They are complementary and indispensable. Therefore, under any tense work or urgent tasks, we must not relax or ignore the work of grasping ideological education. Here, as a member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, I especially hope that our industrialists and businessmen should attach great importance to the relationship between political and ideological reform and serving socialism. Premier Zhou pointed out in his government work report that our industrialists and businessmen must continue to conduct self-education and self-reform in the work of participating in socialist construction in the future. We should follow Premier Zhou's instructions and closely combine accepting reform and actively serving. On the one hand, we must immediately get on the horse, catch up with the situation, respond to the call of the Party and the government, participate in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, contribute ideas and skills, contribute to the vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy, and actively serve the country's socialist construction. On the other hand, we must firmly and loyally accept the leadership of the Party, accept the supervision and assistance of the working class, learn from the workers and masses with an open mind, gradually overcome bourgeois individualism, gradually establish the collectivism of the working class, cultivate the socialist labor attitude and labor viewpoint, and learn socialist management. We must constantly break the capitalist position and thought and establish the socialist position and thought in work, labor, and other social practices, and in political study, and strengthen the fundamental reform of the political position and thought according to the six political criteria proposed by Chairman Mao. We must recognize that without political and ideological reform, active service has no soul or direction; without active service, strengthening reform becomes empty talk. More reform, more service; similarly, more service, more reform. To serve socialism well, we must combine it with political and ideological reform.

Indian expansionists' actions seriously threaten Sino-Indian friendly relations and the Five Principles

Fellow deputies, fellow members: The rapid leap forward of our country is greatly feared by imperialism headed by the United States. The US imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan. Imperialism and all domestic and foreign reactionaries are not reconciled to the increasing failures they are encountering everywhere, and they are still racking their brains and conspiring to disrupt and undermine our independence and construction. The treasonous crimes publicly launched by the former local government of Tibet and a handful of upper-class reactionary groups in Tibet are a good proof. Now, a handful of Tibetan traitors who have fled to India are further colluding with imperialism and Indian expansionists to continue to kidnap the Dalai Lama and issued a so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" full of loopholes and reversing black and white on April 18, and are still carrying out other ulterior activities. We cannot help but ask: What is the reason and what is the reason that a handful of Tibetan traitors and foreign reactionaries can openly carry out activities against our country in India? Why are some people in India so good and so close to those reactionaries, and why do they keep saying that "Tibetans are different from Chinese Han people"? Don't they know that China has always been a multi-ethnic family, and that the Tibetan, Han, Mongolian, Hui, and dozens of other ethnic groups are all Chinese? (Warm applause) In India, some people even shouted "Tibetan independence." Can they close their eyes and deny that Tibet has always been an inseparable part of China, and think that people do not know that the so-called "Tibetan independence" is actually another name for the imperialist conspiracy to occupy Tibet? (Applause) I hope that the people in India will recognize the following fact, that is: the handful of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet who are currently fleeing in India are the scum of the Tibetan people, and 99 percent of the broad masses of the Tibetan people firmly support the unity and integrity of the motherland, firmly oppose the criminal acts of these traitors, and are irreconcilable with the traitors. We also want to solemnly point out that China and India have always been friendly neighbors, and the people of our two countries have always been close friends. The governments of China and India are the initiators of the "Five Principles." As friends, we should join hands to oppose imperialism, and as friends, we should work together to maintain friendly relations between the two countries. Now, the support of the Indian expansionists for the handful of Tibetan traitors who have fled to India has seriously threatened the friendly relations between China and India and the Five Principles, which is intolerable to the Chinese people. (Applause) Can the Chinese people, who are heroically building socialism, allow foreign forces to damage our independence and unity, and interfere with and manipulate our internal affairs? I believe that all upright Indian people will not tolerate for long the collusion between Tibetan traitors and Indian expansionists to carry out criminal activities against China in their country. (Applause)

We want to warn imperialism and all domestic and foreign reactionaries that your vicious and exhausted criminal actions cannot move the Chinese people by half a hair. The Chinese people will never relax their vigilance against you at any time. If you dare to take any risks, you will not escape the giant palm of the Chinese people, and you will definitely break your heads and bleed. (Warm applause) Our people of all ethnic groups throughout the country must unite better, mobilize all positive factors, go all out under the leadership of the Party and the state, take big steps, continue to leap forward, work hard, practically, and skillfully, and strive to the end to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan, and to accelerate the construction of socialism. (Long and warm applause)

    警告印度扩张主义分子必须停止对友好邻邦的不友好行动
    陈叔通代表的发言主席，各位代表，各位委员：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”、李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”、彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席分别代表人大常务委员会和政协常务委员会所作的工作报告。我想，任何一个爱国明理的人，听到了这些报告，看到了十年来特别是第一个五年计划期内我们国家在各方面的伟大成就，看到了一九五八年我们国家在各个战线上的全面大跃进，都一定会感到欢欣鼓舞；一定会感到国家发展得快，共产党和毛主席领导得好，社会主义制度的优越无比；一定会以更大的信心和干劲，来迎接一九五九年更大的跃进。
    （鼓掌）
    今年是我国第二个五年计划苦战三年带有决定意义的一年，我们一九五九年的国民经济计划，是一个在一九五八年大跃进的基础上继续跃进的计划，是一个气魄宏伟而又完全可靠的计划。所有计划中的四大指标和其他各项指标，都是充分估计了可能性之后提出来的。以钢产量指标为例，今年提出产钢一千八百万吨，实际上仅以十八个重点企业的炼钢能力计算，就超过一千六百万吨。我们知道，大跃进不是凭空而来的。如果我们没有第一个五年计划的伟大成就，没有反右、整风运动的伟大胜利，没有党的社会主义建设的总路线的光辉照耀，就不可能得到一九五八年那样巨大的跃进。今天，客观条件对于我们更加有利了，在第一个五年计划胜利实现的基础上，我们又有了一九五八年大跃进的丰富经验和物质技术基础，有了人民公社这样可以大大促进生产发展的基层社会组织，有着越来越提高的人民思想觉悟和革命干劲，还有苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私援助，这就使我们一九五九年的计划指标在可靠的基础上很多方面都超过了去年，有些指标的增长百分比虽然表面上看起来略低于去年，但绝对数字还是有很大的增加。在我们的国家里，党和政府办一切事情都是从实际出发，说到那里就做到那里的。一九五八年大跃进的巨大成就，给了所谓“观潮派”和“算帐派”以很大的教训，如果今天还有“观潮派”和“算帐派”的话，那末事实也一定会给他们以更好的教训。
    我们今年的国民经济计划，是党和国家的社会主义建设总路线的产物。在这个计划里，充分地体现着党所制定的，在优先发展重工业的基础上实行工业和农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的一套“两条腿走路”的方针；充分体现了工业以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针；同时，也体现了国民经济有计划按比例高速度发展的客观规律，贯彻了“全国一盘棋”的精神。所有这些，都是党根据我们当前建设的具体情况决定的。实践证明了党所采取的这些政策方针，已经而且正在我们国家建设事业中发挥无限的威力。国民经济各部门的发展，是相互依存、相互推动、相互制约的，在国民经济高速度的发展中，必须既有重点，又有一般；既有跃进，又有平衡。在一切事物的发展中，平衡是暂时的、相对的现象，不平衡则是经常的、绝对的。我们所需要的平衡，是一种重点带动一般，先进推动落后的平衡；也就是在经济各部门飞跃发展的基础上，尽可能照顾到各方面的比例关系，不断地组织起来的新的平衡；也就是贯彻“两条腿走路”、“全国一盘棋”的方针的平衡。在高速度发展中，在某些方面出现暂时的脱节现象是不能完全避免的，也是可以克服的。例如，我们在一九五八年大跃进中，出现了某些物品供应紧张的现象，这在消费者的角度看来可能是一个缺点，但是，从六亿人民的整体利益出发，把它和整个国家大跃进的巨大成就比较起来，就是九个指头和一个指头的关系。我们要求不断地克服缺点，不断地组织新的平衡，决不能因此就否定大跃进的成就，更不应当为了追求保持机械的平衡，而去阻碍各方面高速度的发展。事实上，在我们的大跃进中，党早已提出了全国一盘棋的方针，各方面都发扬了共产主义大协作的精神，随着大跃进的进一步发展，毫无疑义，一九五九年和今后，这种共产主义的大协作精神一定会有更大的提高。（鼓掌）
    工商业者应该把接受改造和积极为社会主义服务结合起来，要认识到：离开了政治思想改造，积极服务就没有灵魂和方向；离开了积极服务，加强改造也就变成了空谈
    我们今年的计划，是一个鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省的计划，为了更好地完成这个计划，必须继续贯彻党的集中领导和群众运动相结合的方针。我们全国人民，几年来在党的领导和教育下，越来越清楚地认识到党的伟大和正确。这是因为，党的一切路线、方针和政策，都完全符合人民群众的最大利益和要求，不论何时何地，都贯彻了群众路线的精神。特别是大跃进以来，党在广大的人民群众中间，深入进行了社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，进行了社会主义建设总路线的思想教育；成百万的干部下放到农村和基层工矿企业，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动；各级领导干部定期到农村当农民、到车间当工人，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和群众打成了一片；在党的反复教导下，还创造了许许多多的群众路线工作经验和方法，如干部种试验田，定期召开各级干部会，在工矿企业中实行两参、一改、三结合等等，这就在广大的人民群众中形成了一种新的气象和风气，进一步密切了干部和群众的联系，大大地鼓舞了劳动人民的积极性，党指到那里，就奔到那里，党的一切指示和号召，一经深入到群众中去，就成为无穷无尽的力量。劳动人民这种在党的领导下所发挥出来的冲天干劲，是一切工作从胜利走向胜利的根本保证，也是实现我们一九五九年更大跃进的根本保证。
    为了更好地全面完成和超额完成一九五九年国民经济计划，还必须继续加强政治思想工作。政治思想工作，是一切工作的根本，政治挂帅，一切工作也就好办了。党从来都是十分重视思想教育工作的，实际上，一九五八年的全面大跃进，就是在全民整风运动的胜利的基础上，在党和国家的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，全国人民在党的领导下破除迷信、解放思想、苦干实干巧干的结果。大家都已经看到，当广大的人民群众响应党的号召，破除了迷信、解放了思想，开始树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格以后，就立刻在工农业生产战线和其他各个战线上，出现了成千成万的惊人的奇迹，使大跃进的巨浪越来越高。由此可见，要有跃进的行动，首先要有跃进的思想，要能够做到继续不断的跃进，必须继续不断地深入进行政治思想工作。应当认识到，加速建设社会主义，逐步由社会主义过渡到共产主义，不但需要物质的条件和基础，还需要精神的条件和基础，它们是相辅相成的，都是不可缺少的。因此我们在任何工作紧张或者任务紧急的情况下，决不能够丝毫放松或者忽视抓紧思想教育的工作。在这里，我作为一个全国工商业联合会的一个成员，特别希望我们工商业者，要十分重视政治思想改造和为社会主义服务的关系这一问题。周总理政府工作报告中已经指出，我们工商业者今后必须在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造。我们应当遵照周总理这一指示，把接受改造和积极服务密切地结合起来。一方面，我们要立即上马，赶上形势，响应党和政府的号召，参加到大跃进行列中去，献计献技，在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中贡献力量，积极地为国家的社会主义建设事业服务；另一方面，必须在积极服务中，坚定不移地忠诚接受党的领导，接受工人阶级的监督和帮助，虚心向工人群众学习，逐步克服资产阶级个人主义，逐步树立工人阶级的集体主义，培养社会主义的劳动态度和劳动观点，学会社会主义的经营管理。要在工作、劳动和其他各项社会实践中，在政治学习中，不断地破资本主义的立场和思想，立社会主义的立场和思想，按照毛主席所提出的六项政治标准，来加强政治立场和思想的根本改造。我们一定要认识到，离开了政治思想改造，积极服务就没有灵魂和方向，离开了积极服务，加强改造也就变成了空谈，多一分改造、多一分服务；同样，多一分服务，多一分改造，要为社会主义服务得好，就要和政治思想改造结合起来。
    印度扩张主义分子的行为严重威胁着中印友好关系和五项原则
    各位代表，各位委员：我们的国家一日千里地向前跃进，是以美国为首的帝国主义所十分害怕的，美帝国主义现在还霸占着我们的台湾。帝国主义和一切国内外反动派还不甘心于它们到处所遭遇到的越来越多的失败，还在处心积虑，阴谋扰乱和破坏我们的独立和建设。最近原西藏地方政府和一小撮上层反动集团在西藏公开发动的叛国罪行，就是一个很好的证明。现在，逃到印度的一小撮西藏叛国分子，正在与帝国主义以及印度的扩张主义分子进一步勾结起来，继续劫持达赖喇嘛，在4月18日发表了一个漏洞百出、颠倒黑白的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，并且还在进行其他种种不可告人的活动。我们不禁要问：是什么原因、什么理由使一小撮西藏叛国分子和国外反动分子可以公然在印度进行反对我国的活动呢？为什么印度有些人和那些反动分子那么要好，那么亲热，也口口声声说什么“西藏人同中国汉人不同”呢？难道不知道中国从来就是一个多民族的大家庭，不知道藏族和汉族、蒙古族、回族以及其他几十个民族一样，都是中国人吗？（热烈鼓掌）在印度，有些人甚至高叫什么“西藏独立”，难道他们可以闭眼否认西藏从来就是中国不可分割的一部分，以为人们不知道所谓“西藏独立”实际上就是帝国主义阴谋侵占西藏的别名吗？（鼓掌）我希望印度的人士认清下面的一个事实，那就是：目前逃亡在印度的一小撮西藏上层反动分子，正是藏族的败类，而百分之九十九的广大的藏族人民，是坚决拥护祖国的统一和完整、坚决反对这些叛国分子的罪恶行为、和叛国分子势不两立的。我们还要严正的提出，中印两国从来都是友好的邻邦，我们两国人民从来都是亲密的朋友，中印两国政府是“五项原则”的倡议者，是朋友就该携起手来反对帝国主义，是朋友就该共同努力来维护两国间的友好关系。现在，印度的扩张主义分子对逃跑到印度的一小撮西藏叛国分子的种种支持，使中印两国的友好关系和五项原则遭到严重的威胁，这是中国人民不能容忍的。（鼓掌）难道正在英勇地建设社会主义的中国人民还能容许外国势力来损害我们的独立和统一，来干涉、摆布我们的内政吗？我相信所有正直的印度人民也不会长期容忍西藏的叛国分子和印度的扩张主义者勾结起来在他们的国内进行反对中国的罪恶活动的。（鼓掌）
    我们要警告帝国主义和一切国内外反动派，你们这种穷凶极恶、心劳日绌的罪恶行动，动不了中国人民半根毫毛，中国人民任何时候也不会放松对于你们的警惕，如果你们敢于作任何的冒险，就难逃中国人民巨掌，就一定会碰得头破血流。（热烈鼓掌）我们全国各族人民，一定要更好地团结起来，调动一切积极因素，在党和国家领导下鼓足干劲，迈开大步，继续跃进，苦干实干巧干，为迎接建国十周年、为完成和超额完成一九五九年国民经济计划、为加速建设社会主义而奋斗到底。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
