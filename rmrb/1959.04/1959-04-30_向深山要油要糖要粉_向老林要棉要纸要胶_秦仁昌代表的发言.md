Fellow Representatives:
	I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government and the reports of other national leaders. These reports once again prove the correctness of the General Line for Socialist Construction formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. They bring boundless strength and great encouragement to the people of the whole country in their great leap forward to complete and overfulfill the various production targets of the state in 1959.
	I am a botanist. In the period of more than a year since the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress, I and botanists across the country have unanimously recognized that the General Line for Socialist Construction formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has opened up a vast world for the development of our country's scientific undertakings, and the unprecedented national economic leap forward in our country in 1958 has powerfully driven the great leap forward in scientific research. On the front of plant science in our country, as with other scientific work, great achievements have also been made, playing a powerful auxiliary role in many aspects of national economic construction. Among the more important ones are: a relatively systematic summary of the effective indigenous pesticides used by our country's farmers for thousands of years, the completion of our country's first vegetation zoning and a 1:4,000,000-scale vegetation map of China, a summary of plant physiology and cell morphology issues in China's agricultural high-yield production, the discovery of some new medicinal plants, the rectification of naming confusions of many commercial medicinal materials, and the carrying out of a mass nationwide expansion of the utilization of wild plants, etc. Today, I will make a simple report to the people of the whole country on the magnificent movement to expand the utilization of wild plants.
	First of all, due to the superiority of its natural geographical conditions, the richness of our country's plant resources is world-renowned. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 30,000 species of higher plants have been discovered, most of which are raw materials for light industry, and many are medicinal materials closely related to people's health. For thousands of years, the working people of our country have accumulated rich experience in the utilization of wild plants, but due to the shortcomings of detachment from reality in plant science work for a long time, we have only had a one-sided understanding of the details of our country's plant resources. Many treasures are buried in the mountains and have not yet been paid attention to for development and utilization. Since the State Council issued the "Instructions on the Utilization and Collection of Wild Plant Raw Materials in Our Country" on April 7, 1958, people in various places have cooperated with commercial purchasing agencies to go up the mountains to collect treasures, launching a vigorous movement to utilize wild plants, providing diverse plant raw materials for socialist construction, and botanists in various places have combined with the masses to compile dozens of types of "Local Resource Plant Chronicles". These achievements have played an important role in supplementing light industry raw materials and promoting the economic prosperity of rural areas, especially mountainous areas. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year alone, about 2,000 kinds of useful wild plants have been discovered, which can be used as raw materials for oils and fats, spices, textiles, papermaking, food, brewing, rubber baking, natural rubber, hard rubber, insecticides, coatings, plastics, dyes, starch, and many medicinal materials, creating a lot of wealth for the country. For example, among the plant essential oil raw materials discovered, the value of only Litsea cubeba is 26 million yuan. Many rubber baking raw materials have replaced imported goods, saving the country more than 20 million yuan in foreign exchange. The fiber raw materials can spin 600,000 pieces of yarn, which can be woven into three chi of cloth per capita for the whole country. The oil raw materials can squeeze 54,000 tons of oil, and the oil cakes can feed 3 million pigs. The starch raw materials can save the country 1.1 million tons of grain. Last year, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces alone processed 180,000 dan of "artificial cotton" from wild fiber raw materials, which is equivalent to the output of 180,000 mu of cotton fields.
	From the above examples, it can be seen how abundant the reserves of our country's wild useful plant resources are and how infinite the potential that can be tapped is. What was considered grass in the past has now become treasure. Farmers in Sichuan said it well, "Break through the mountains, open the treasure house, seek oil, sugar, and flour from deep mountains, and seek cotton, paper, and rubber from old forests." In fact, fully utilizing wild plants can not only greatly promote the development of oil, textile, papermaking, medicinal materials, rubber baking, dyes, coatings, and other production, but also increase export sources and earn foreign exchange. What is particularly important is that before the "three-three" system of land utilization is implemented, the large-scale use of wild plants to extract fibers, oils, and spices can solve the contradiction between cotton and grain, and oil and grain competing for land in rural areas to a certain extent, and provide an extremely important outlet for the people's growing need for living materials in the future.
	According to preliminary investigations, our country's wild plants are also particularly rich in raw materials for advanced industry and special medicine. Yunnan, known as the "Kingdom of Plants" in the world, has particularly rich plant resources. According to preliminary investigations, among the more than 1,000 known wild industrial plant raw materials, those with relatively abundant reserves include a shrub that can be used to extract borneol and camphor oil, called Neocinnamomum, a new Litsea cubeba that extracts the advanced fragrance raw materials dihydrocitronellal and dihydrocitronellol, Gaultheria which contains up to 99% methyl salicylate, Rauvolfia verticillata, discovered to treat hypertension, can produce 200,000 jin per year in Xichou County alone, and several Dioscorea plants containing saponins, which are the main raw materials for refining cortisone hormones. Among the fiber plant raw materials, Asclepias syriaca, a raw material plant for making advanced rayon and artificial silk, has been discovered, and it has great prospects for development in the arid Honghe Valley.
	Among the discovered wild plant raw materials, many species have high comprehensive utilization value. For example, Diospyros mollis, which is produced in Yunnan and Guangdong, can be used as raw materials for extracting rubber baking, dyes, starch, and saponins. Alocasia macrorrhizos, which is widely distributed in southern Yunnan, its stalks can be made into rayon, its roots can extract high-grade starch, and its leaves can be used as feed. The fruits of Litsea cubeba, which is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of our country, are not only an important raw material for essential oils, but can also extract 33% of solid oil for industrial use, and its leaves can be distilled to obtain geraniol oil. Konjac is a widely distributed and high-yielding wild vegetable in our country. Many people have eaten it, but it is a superior industrial raw material for replacing imported building materials, Cyrtomium fortunei, and for sizing, plastics, coatings, etc.
	One of the most prominent features of wild plants in our country is the discovery that some plant species objectively existing in nature can completely meet the requirements of people's subjective wishes in the past. As everyone knows, natural camphor and camphor oil are distilled from the wood of camphor trees. Camphor trees of 40 to 60 years or more can be felled and utilized, which is an insurmountable shortcoming of camphor trees. However, there is a kind of camphor tree in Yunnan that is like a mulberry tree, and camphor and camphor oil are extracted from its leaves, which can be used every year. Therefore, after afforestation, it can be used for a long time. Cymbopogon winterianus, a kind of citronella that extracts essential oils, is cultivated on Hainan Island by cutting down forests, while in southern Yunnan, a kind of citronella grass that can extract dihydrocitronellal essence has been discovered, which has always been wild and grows densely all over the mountains and fields, and can be used in large quantities. For example, the machine manufacturing industry needs a high-grade release agent called lycopodium powder, which has always been imported. Now that the demand is increasing and the foreign supply is experiencing difficulties, the machine industry has put forward the task of finding lycopodium powder in China to plant scientists. Now it has been discovered that among the domestic lycopodium plants, the spore powder of five kinds of lycopodium can completely meet the requirements of machine manufacturing in terms of yield and quality, supporting the production of the machine industry and saving foreign exchange. From these facts, we can see how rich and diverse the species of our country's plant resources are. It seems that we can find whatever we subjectively want.
	In addition to tropical and subtropical regions, wild industrial plant raw materials are also quite abundant in other regions of our country. The problem is that in the past, everyone regarded them as useless weeds and did not study them. For example, in Jiangsu Province, where agricultural management is highly intensive in our country, there are relatively few plant species, but after the results of the general survey and analysis in 1958, among the plant raw materials with higher utilization value, according to preliminary statistics, there are 188 kinds of fiber plants, 111 kinds of starch plants, 142 kinds of oil plants, 70 kinds of rubber baking plants, 198 kinds of medicinal plants, 110 kinds of insecticide plants, 27 kinds of tea substitutes, etc. Of course, the wild plant raw materials in many other provinces and regions are much richer than those in Jiangsu Province.
	From this, it can be seen that wild plants are an inexhaustible source of wealth in our country. When talking about the great potential of China's plant resources, some people have compared China to an omnipotent great chemical factory. This green natural chemical factory does not need to burn a jin of coal or spend a degree of electricity, and every day it automatically produces a large number of food, clothing raw materials, medicinal materials, wood, fuel, and tens of thousands of industrial raw materials for the people of the whole country. But only today, under the leadership of the Party, have the Chinese people who have turned over become the real masters of this green factory. We must all manage this fully automated factory well so that it will always produce more and better wealth to serve socialist to communist construction.
	1959 is a year for striving for greater, more, and more comprehensive great leaps forward on all production fronts in our country. It is also a year for plant scientists across the country to march towards wild plants. Now, a team of four to five thousand people has been formed across the country. Under the leadership of the Party committees of each province (region), they start from the Greater Khingan Mountains and Changbai Mountains in the north, to Hainan Island and the Shiwan Mountains in the south, from the coast in the east, to the Yunnan-Tibet Plateau in the west, and the Kunlun Mountains, Tianshan Mountains, and Altai Mountains in the northwest. They are carrying out an unprecedented and in-depth and meticulous survey and utilization of wild plant resources. Everyone is full of energy, overcoming difficulties, climbing high mountains, and going deep into old forests, with full confidence in exploring more and better industrial raw materials and special medicinal materials for the socialist construction of the motherland to support the country's production and construction.
	It should be pointed out that the survey of wild plants and the local and national "Economic Plant Chronicles" to be published next year are only the first step for us to expand the utilization of wild plant resources. To find out the details of our country's extremely rich wild plant resources, there is a series of scientific problems that need to be solved, which requires the communist great collaboration between relevant economic departments, such as commerce, agriculture, forestry, light industry, and many scientific research institutions and universities. The current surveys are only some point and line work, which is not comprehensive and detailed enough. The scientific groups under the leadership of the Science and Technology Association in the rural people's communes will be the basic team for further carrying out a comprehensive survey and utilization of wild plants in various regions. It is hoped that plant societies and research institutions in various places will establish close business contacts with them as soon as possible so that plant science can take root in rural areas and plant science knowledge can be mastered by the masses.
	On the other hand, in the work of utilizing wild plant resources, we must implement the "Localities must conduct investigations and research, conduct overall planning, and adopt the principle of full utilization and active development for wild plant raw materials" in the State Council's instructions. This means that collection and protection should be combined, utilization and proliferation should be combined. While fully utilizing wild plants, we must ensure that they can continue to grow and reproduce. We should not drain the pond to catch fish or kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. For many wild plants with high value and wide uses, including medicinal plants, we must first cultivate them artificially in their place of origin to quickly increase their yield and quality so that these areas can gradually become production bases for these plant raw materials.
	Fellow representatives, please allow me to guarantee to the Congress on behalf of plant scientists across the country that, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, we must go all out to complete the tasks assigned to us by the state in 1959, especially to discover more than 2,000 kinds of wild plant industrial raw materials with high economic value and medicinal plants with good efficacy nationwide, to accelerate the development of our country's light industry and the prosperity of people's health care, to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland.

### 向深山要油要糖要粉  向老林要棉要纸要胶  秦仁昌代表的发言

    向深山要油要糖要粉  向老林要棉要纸要胶
    秦仁昌代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意和衷心拥护周总理关于政府工作的报告以及其他国家领导人员的报告，这些报告都又一次证明了党中央和毛主席制定的社会主义建设总路线的正确性和社会主义制度的无比优越性，并且给全国人民在为完成和超额完成国家一九五九年各项生产指标的大跃进中带来了无限力量和极大鼓舞。
    我是个植物学工作者，在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议以来的一年多的时期里，我和全国植物学工作者一致认识到党中央和毛主席制定的社会主义建设总路线对发展我国科学事业开辟了广阔天地，而一九五八年在我国历史上出现空前未有的国民经济大跃进，有力地带动了科学研究的大跃进。在我国植物学工作战线上，如同其他科学工作一样，也取得了很大成绩，对国家经济建设的许多方面起了有力的助手作用，其中较为重要的有：比较系统地总结了我国农民几千年来行之有效的土农药，完成了我国第一个植被区划和四百万分之一的中国植被图，总结了我国农业丰产中植物生理学和细胞形态学问题，发现了一些新的药用植物，和整理了许多商品药材命名上的混乱问题，开展了群众性的全国野生植物的扩大利用等等。今天仅就波涛壮阔的野生植物扩大利用运动向全国人民做个简单汇报。
    首先，由于所处自然地理条件的优越，我国植物资源的丰富程度是世界闻名的，据不完全的统计，现已发现的高等植物种类将近三万种，其中大多数种类是轻工业原料，还有许多是同人民健康密切有关的药材。数千年来我国劳动人民对野生植物的利用也积累了丰富经验，但由于长期以来在植物学工作中存在着脱离实际的缺点，一直对我国植物资源的底细只有片面的了解，很多宝藏埋没山野，还未注意开发利用。自从一九五八年四月七日国务院发布了“关于利用和收集我国野生植物原料的指示”以后，各地群众配合商业收购机构纷纷上山采宝，开展了一个轰轰烈烈的野生植物利用运动，为社会主义建设提供了多种多样的植物原料，并且各地植物学工作者与群众结合一起编写了数十种的“土资源植物志”。这些成果在对轻工业原料提供了重要补充的同时，对农村特别是山区的经济繁荣起了不少作用。根据不完全的资料统计，在过去一年内就发现了大约两千种的有用野生植物，可做油脂、香料、纺织、造纸、食品、酿造、烤胶、橡胶、硬橡胶、杀虫药、涂料、塑料、染料、淀粉和许多药材的原料，替国家创造了不少财富。例如在发现的植物芳香油原料中，仅山苍子一种价值就在二千六百万元，许多烤胶原料代替了进口货，为国家节约外汇二千万元以上，纤维原料可纺织六十万件纱，可织成全国每人平均分得三尺的布，油料可榨油五万四千吨，油饼可喂猪三百万头，淀纷原料可给国家节约粮食一百一十万吨。仅四川、云南两省去年利用野生纤维原料加工制成的“人造棉”就有十八万担，约相当于十八万亩棉田的产量。
    从上面几个例子，可见我国野生有用植物资源的蕴藏量是何等雄厚，可发掘的潜力是无穷的。过去认为是草，现在都成了宝。四川农民说得好，“攻破山头，打开宝库，向深山要油，要糖，要粉，向老林要棉，要纸，要胶。”其实，充分利用野生植物，不仅可以大大促进油料，纺织，造纸，药材，烤胶，染料，涂料等生产的发展，还可以增加出口货源，换取外汇，特别重要的是在土地利用的“三三”制还未实行以前，大量利用野生植物提取纤维，油脂和香料，可以在一定程度上解决目前在农村中棉粮争地，油粮争地的矛盾，和今后人民对生活资料日益增长的需要提供一项极其重要的出路。
    根据初步调查，我国野生植物中还特别富于高级工业和特种医药原料。在被誉为世界“植物王国”的云南，植物资源特别丰富。经过初步调查，在已知的一千多种野生工业植物原料中，蕴藏量比较丰富的有可供提取龙脑香和樟油的一种灌木，叫新樟，提取高级香精原料雄刈萱醛和雄刈萱醇的一种新木姜子，有含水杨酸甲脂高达百分之九十九的透骨草，发现治高血压症的萝芙木仅西畴一县就可年产二十万斤，有好几种含皂甙的薯蓣植物，为提炼肾皮激素的主要原料。在纤维植物原料中，发现了可制高级人造棉和人造丝原料植物牛角瓜，在气候干旱的红河谷地有极大的发展前途。
    在已发现的野生植物原料中，许多种类有较高的综合利用价值，例如产在云南、两广的薯莨可以作为提取烤胶、染料、淀粉和皂甙的原料，在云南南部分布很广的芭蕉芋，它的杆可制人造棉，根可提取高级淀粉，叶可作饲料。分布在我国热带亚热带的木姜子的果实不仅是芳香油的重要原料，还可榨取百分之三十三的供工业用的固体油，而且它的叶可蒸取香叶醇油。磨芋在我国是一种分布广、产量大的野生蔬菜，许多人都吃过的，但它是代替进口的建筑材料鸡脚菜和浆纱，塑料，涂料的上等工业原料，等等。
    在我国的野生植物中最突出的一个情况是：发现自然界中客观存在的一些植物种类能够完全符合于过去人们主观愿望的要求。大家知道，天然樟脑和樟油是从樟树的木材蒸馏出来的。四十至六十年以上的樟树才能被砍伐利用，这是樟树的一个不可克服的缺点。但在云南却有一种樟树，好像桑树一样，是用它的叶子提出樟脑和樟油的，每年都能利用，因此，一次造林后，可以长期利用。提取芳香油的一种香茅在海南岛是砍掉森林来栽培的，而在云南南部，却发现一种可以提取雄刈萱醛香精的香茅草，从来就是野生的，漫山遍野长得密不可入，可以大量利用。又如机器制造工业中需要一种高级脱模剂，叫石松粉，过去一直是进口的，现在需要量增加，国外供应发生困难，机器工业就对植物学工作者提出了在国内寻找石松粉的任务，现在发现，在国产石松植物中，有五种石松的孢粉在产量和质量上完全可以满足机器制造的要求，支援了机器工业的生产，并且节省了外汇。从这些事实，可以看到我国植物资源的种类是何等丰富多采。好像我们主观想要什么就能找到什么。
    除热带和亚热带地区以外，野生工业植物原料在我国其他地区也是相当丰富的，问题在于过去大家都把它们看成无用的野草，不加钻研。例如在我国农业经营高度集约的江苏省，植物种类是比较不多的，可是经过一九五八年的普查分析结果，在有较高利用价值的植物原料中，据初步统计，就有纤维植物一百八十八种，淀粉植物一百一十一种，油料植物一百四十二种，烤胶植物七十种，药用植物一百九十八种，杀虫剂植物一百一十种，代茶植物二十七种，等等。其他许多省区的野生植物原料，当然比江苏省更加丰富多了。
    由此可见，野生植物在我国是取之不尽的财源。在谈到中国植物资源的巨大潜力时，有人曾把中国比喻成为一个万能的伟大化工厂。这个绿色的天然化工厂，不需要烧一斤煤，费一度电，每天都在为全国人民自动化地生产出大批的食物，衣服原料，药材，木材，燃料和数以万计的工业原料。但只有到了今天在党的领导下翻了身的中国人民才真正成为这个绿色大工厂的主人。我们大家一定要管理好这全自动化的大工厂，使它永远生产更多更好的财富为社会主义到共产主义建设服务。
    一九五九年是我国各个生产战线上争取更大更多更全面大跃进的一年，也是全国植物学工作者向野生植物大进军的一年。现在全国已组成了一支四五千人的队伍，在各省（区）党委领导下，北起大兴安岭，长白山，南迄海南岛，十万大山，东自海边，西达滇藏高原，西北到昆仑山，天山，阿尔泰山，正在开展一个史无前例的，深入细致的野生植物资源普查利用工作。他们个个干劲冲天，踏破铁鞋，克服困难，攀登高山，深入老林，满怀信心地为祖国社会主义建设发掘更多更好的工业原料和特种药材，支援国家的生产建设。
    应该指出，野生植物的普查以及明年将要出版的地方的和全国的“经济植物志”，只不过是我们对于野生植物资源扩大利用的第一步。要摸清我国十分丰富的野生植物资源的底细，有一系列科学问题需要解决，这就要靠有关经济部门，如商业，农业，林业，轻工业和许多科学研究机构以及高等学校之间的共产主义大协作。目前的调查只是一些点线工作，还不够全面细致。农村人民公社在科协领导下的科学小组，将是各地区进一步开展野生植物全面普查利用的基本队伍，希望各地植物学会和研究机构尽快地同它们在业务上得到密切联系，使植物学在农村生根，植物学的知识为广大群众所掌握。
    另一方面，在野生植物资源利用工作中，必须贯彻国务院指示中的“各地对于野生植物原料，必须经过调查研究，进行全面规划，采取充分利用，积极发展的方针”，这就是说要采集与保护相结合、利用与增殖相结合，在充分利用野生植物的同时，要保证它们能够继续生长繁殖，不要竭泽而渔，杀鸡取卵，对许多价值高、用途广的野生植物，包括药用植物，还得首先在它们的原产地进行人工栽培，迅速提高它们的产量和质量，使这些地区逐渐成为这些植物原料的生产基地。
    各位代表，请允许我代表全国植物学工作者向大会提出保证，在党的领导下和全国人民的支援下，我们一定要鼓足干劲，出色地完成一九五九年国家交给我们的任务，特别要在全国范围内发现两千种以上的经济价值高的野生植物工业原料和效力好的药用植物，以加速我国轻工业的发展和人民保健事业的繁荣，来迎接我们伟大祖国诞生的十周年国庆。
