　　The Wellington Conference's Anti-Peace Conspiracy
    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Council meeting held in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, hastily concluded on April 10. Most of the meeting was conducted in secret, but based on information revealed from various sources and the final communique issued by the meeting, it can be seen that the purpose of the United States in convening this meeting was to plot new aggression and subversion in the Far East, create new tensions, and further intensify its control over the Asian member states of SEATO. The Wellington Conference was convened against the backdrop of the United States' power politics repeatedly running into obstacles, the bleak prospects of the North Atlantic Group, the complete collapse of the Baghdad Pact due to Iraq's announcement of its withdrawal, and the surging tide of the world peace movement, with people yearning for the melting of the "Cold War" ice. Under these circumstances, the United States is stepping up its aggression in Asia, aiming not only at the Asian people, but also attempting to poison the entire international situation, in order to prevent any easing of the international situation.
    Under the guise of so-called "defense," the Wellington Conference first plotted a conspiracy to intensify military aggression in the Far East. The conference communique acknowledged the need for the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" to continue strengthening its military activities and so-called "deterrent forces." According to a Reuters dispatch from Wellington, the secret meeting discussed a "military strategy report" and planned to establish a so-called "mobile force." This aggressive force would be used to deal with "domestic unrest" in Southeast Asian countries and "take action according to pre-arranged blueprints." The planners of this conspiracy even called this aggressive army a "fire brigade" to "deal with emergencies." The Asian and African people are no strangers to the imperialist "fire brigade." When Britain and France launched a military invasion of Egypt, didn't they also call themselves a "fire brigade"? When U.S. and British imperialism armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, didn't they also claim to be going to "deal with" some "emergency"? The so-called "fire brigade" is precisely an arson squad, to suppress the national liberation movement in Asia and threaten peace in Asia with force at any time. Isn't this clear?
    Under the guise of so-called "anti-subversion," the Wellington Conference also plotted subversive activities against Southeast Asian national independent states and further expanded the scope of SEATO's aggression. In recent times, U.S. imperialism has been carrying out aggressive conspiracies to seize the entire Indochina, and at this Wellington Conference, Washington's conspiracy was even more exposed. The participants in the meeting actually referred to South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as "protected states" of SEATO. They even secretly discussed the "political and economic situation in Laos and the need for greater military strength." This group of conspirators also believed that the "political system in Laos was weak and powerless," and formulated a "blueprint" for the invasion of Laos, and studied the "strategic necessity" of Cambodia and South Vietnam, and so on. According to a Reuters dispatch on April 8, "Laos has in fact abolished the Geneva Accords that restrict military assistance from foreign countries, and can therefore freely accept foreign military assistance." This irrefutably proves that the United States directed the Lao authorities to tear up the Geneva Accords precisely in order to carry out a large amount of military infiltration into Laos, so as to further control Laos. As everyone knows, recently, the United States has successively plotted subversive conspiracies against Cambodia, using South Vietnam and Thailand as bases, in order to realize its wild ambition to swallow the entire Indochina. This series of aggressive conspiracies planned by U.S. imperialism through the Wellington Conference cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the people of Asian countries.
    The United States also wanted to turn the Wellington Conference into a platform for attacking and smearing China, in order to cover up U.S. aggression and subversion in Asia, provoke relations between China and other Asian countries, and force the Asian member states of SEATO to interfere in China's internal affairs with it. In order to achieve this goal, U.S. representative Dillon took the lead at the beginning of the meeting in shouting that the so-called "conscience of free nations" cannot tolerate the "atrocities of the Communists in Tibet." He openly supported the Tibetan rebels and praised them as "heroic people." At the same time, Dillon-style arguments also appeared in the conference communique, saying that SEATO expressed "disgust" at the "violence and oppressive measures" used to deal with the Tibetan rebels. This is of course not surprising. Imperialist support and encouragement of the rebellion in Chinese Tibet is just like their support and encouragement of the rebellion in Indonesia, which is a well-known fact. When imperialism constantly plots subversive activities in peace-loving countries, supports traitors to use violence to undermine the independence, unity, and security of their motherland, their "conscience" never has any problems; but whenever these rebellions are struck down and the people celebrate victory, the imperialists express "sadness." This kind of shameful face is truly disgusting!
    The U.S. imperialists probably also know that their hackneyed tunes about "Communist aggression" have been repeated so often that people's ears are calloused, and few people still listen to them. Therefore, they have invented a new anti-communist argument, called opposing the "economic expansion" of socialist countries. The Wellington Conference communique insisted that "the economic activities of the Communists are obviously politically motivated" and should be "exposed." This is truly absurd. As everyone knows, the foreign economic activities of socialist countries are based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, with the aim of mutual exchange and promotion of international cooperation. If there is a political motive here, then what is wrong with this motive? On the contrary, the foreign economic activities of imperialism are not only aimed at mad plunder and exploitation, but also always try to use its economic power to enslave and control other countries, in order to achieve the goal of harming others and benefiting oneself. The United States has forced many countries to implement an "embargo" against China, attempting to suffocate the Chinese people; now it wants to destroy China's normal trade and economic cooperation with Asian and African countries under the guise of opposing "Communist economic expansion," in order to facilitate its own real economic expansion. All these activities are unequivocally based on the most despicable political motives and should be exposed and opposed.
    It is worth noting that the United States' use of SEATO to plot various conspiracies and tricks not only runs into obstacles everywhere in Asia, but is also often not so smooth within the group itself. The Wellington Conference showed that the divisions within SEATO, especially the divisions between the United States and the three Asian member states, have become increasingly apparent. The three Asian member states repeatedly demanded the strengthening of the "economic aspects" of SEATO at this conference. This is not difficult to understand. As a result of Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines participating in the U.S. military bloc and following the U.S. policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, they have been driven to poverty and exhaustion, with numerous difficulties, and the entire country is in a state of devastation. Even the Wellington Conference communique admitted to the "excessive burden caused by defense preparations" for member states. However, the United States has never been interested in developing the independent economic strength of these member states. The so-called "Council recognizes the importance of raising living standards and providing opportunities for development" in the conference communique is nothing more than empty talk. In fact, with the development of the capitalist world economic crisis, the United States will only intensify its plunder and expansion of underdeveloped countries. Not only that, but the United States, for its own selfish purposes, has also introduced another "cooperator" to Southeast Asian countries, namely Japanese monopoly capital represented by the Nobusuke Kishi government. Eisenhower's recent public support for Japan's expansion into Southeast Asia is definitely not good news for the people of Southeast Asian countries. It can be seen that it would be an illusion for the Asian member states of SEATO to rely on U.S. "aid" to solve their economic problems.
    In order to conceal the aggressive nature of SEATO, the Wellington Conference deliberately reiterated in its communique that member states "guarantee to seek peaceful means to resolve international disputes and not to engage in threats in international relations." The communique also stated that since the establishment of SEATO, "trust and stability in the region have increased significantly." However, based on what SEATO has done, people can only prove that this is a series of lies. What kind of "peaceful means" has SEATO sought in the more than four years since its establishment? Ignoring the universal desire of the people of Asian countries for peaceful coexistence, it has always rejected the various peace proposals of all peace-loving countries, and insisted on implementing the U.S. policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, establishing U.S. military bases on the territories of Asian countries, stationing U.S. troops, and frequently conducting military exercises, intimidating the Asian people. SEATO has also continuously interfered in the internal affairs of Asian countries, carrying out subversive activities, and threatening the security and independence of these countries. All of this will of course only create antagonism between Asian countries and tension in Asia, and keep peace in the Asian region in a long-term state of instability.
    The vast people of Asia have increasingly seen the harm of the U.S.-manipulated SEATO to peace in Asia. The anti-peace conspiracies planned by the Wellington Conference have aroused condemnation from the people of Asia and the world. Statements from the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and Korea, as well as fair public opinion in various countries, all unanimously pointed out that peace-loving people must further unite to stop imperialism from creating new tensions in Asia. The Asian people, like the people of the world, resolutely demand the realization of peaceful coexistence between the people of all countries, the consolidation and expansion of the Asian peace zone, the maintenance of the independence and freedom of the people of all countries, and the promotion of friendly cooperation between the people of all countries. This is an irresistible trend of the times. The United States' assembling of military blocs everywhere and its insistence on the "Cold War" and aggressive policies are doomed to have no future. Those who disregard their own national interests, are obsessed and unwilling to repent, and are willing to follow U.S. imperialism will also have to bear all the consequences caused by U.S. aggressive policies.

### 惠灵顿会议的反和平阴谋

　　惠灵顿会议的反和平阴谋
    在新西兰首都惠灵顿举行的东南亚条约组织理事会会议，已在4月10日草草收场。这个会议的大部分时间都是秘密进行的，但是根据各方面透露的消息和会议所发表的最后公报可以看出，美国纠集这次会议的目的是要在远东地区策划新的侵略阴谋和颠复活动，制造新的紧张局势，并进一步加紧对于东南亚集团的亚洲成员国的控制。惠灵顿会议是在美国实力政策到处碰壁、北大西洋集团前景黯淡、巴格达条约由于伊拉克的宣布退出而彻底垮台，而世界和平运动的洪流汹涌澎湃、人心渴望“冷战”冰块消融的形势下召开的。在这种情况下，美国加紧在亚洲的侵略活动，其矛头就不仅是针对亚洲人民，而且企图借此毒化整个的国际局势，达到阻止国际局势的任何和缓的目的。
    惠灵顿会议在所谓“防御”的幌子下，首先策划了在远东加紧军事侵略的阴谋。会议的公报承认，“东南亚条约组织”有必要继续加强军事活动和所谓“威慑力量”。据路透社发自惠灵顿的电讯透露，秘密会议曾讨论了一个“军事战略报告”，并策划成立一支所谓“机动部队”。这支侵略部队将要用来对付东南亚各国的“国内骚乱”，并“根据事前拟订的蓝图采取行动”。这个阴谋的策划者竟把这支侵略军队称为“应付紧急事件”的“救火队”。亚非人民对于帝国主义的“救火队”一点也不陌生。当英国和法国对埃及发动军事侵略的时候，他们不是也自命为“救火队”的吗？当美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的时候，他们不也是自称是去“应付”什么“紧急事件”的吗？所谓“救火队”，恰恰是放火队，是为了随时用武力镇压亚洲地区民族解放运动和威胁亚洲和平，难道这不是清清楚楚的吗。
    惠灵顿会议也在所谓“反颠复”的幌子下，策划了颠复东南亚民族独立国家的阴谋活动，并进一步扩大了东南亚集团的侵略范围。最近一个时期以来，美帝国主义一直在进行着夺取整个印度支那的侵略阴谋，而在这次惠灵顿会议上，华盛顿的这一阴谋更加暴露无遗。会议的参加者们居然把南越、老挝和柬埔寨称为东南亚集团的“保护国”。他们更秘密地讨论了“老挝的政治和经济以及需要有更大的军事力量”的问题。这一群阴谋家们还认为“老挝政治制度软弱无力”，而拟订了侵略老挝的“蓝图”，并研究了柬埔寨和南越的“战略必要性”等等。据路透社4月8日电讯透露，“老挝事实上废除了限制从外国得到军事援助的日内瓦协定，因而可以自由地接受外国的军事援助”。这就无可置辩地证明了美国指使老挝当局撕毁日内瓦协议，正是为了对老挝进行大量的军事渗入，以便进一步控制老挝。大家知道，最近一个时期，美国以南越和泰国为基地接连地策划了对柬埔寨的颠复阴谋，也就是为了实现它吞噬整个印度支那的狂妄野心。美帝国主义通过惠灵顿会议策划的这一系列侵略阴谋是不能不引起亚洲各国人民的严重警惕的。
    美国还想把惠灵顿会议变为一个攻击和污蔑中国的讲台，以掩盖美国在亚洲的侵略和颠复活动，挑拨中国和其他亚洲国家的关系，并强使东南亚集团的亚洲成员国同它一起干涉中国内政。为了实现这个目的，美国代表狄龙在会议的一开始就带头叫嚷所谓“自由国家的良心”不能容忍“共产党在西藏的暴行”。他公开支持西藏叛乱分子，把他们誉为“英勇的人们”。同时，在会议公报中也出现了狄龙式的论调，说什么东南亚集团对于用来对付西藏叛乱分子的“暴力和压迫措施”表示“憎恶”。这当然并没有任何奇怪。帝国主义支持和鼓励中国西藏的叛乱，正同它们支持和鼓励印度尼西亚的叛乱一样，是人所共知的事实。当帝国主义在爱好和平的国家里不断地策划颠复活动，支持叛国分子使用暴力破坏祖国的独立、统一和安全的时候，它们的“良心”是从来不发生问题的；可是每当这些叛乱遭到打击而人民欢庆胜利的时候，帝国主义者就表示“难过”起来。这种可耻的嘴脸，才是真正令人感到憎恶的！
    美帝国主义者大概也知道，他们关于“共产主义侵略”之类的滥调已经讲得使人们耳朵里生茧了，很少有什么人还听得进去。于是，他们就又发明了一种新的反共论调，叫做反对社会主义国家的“经济扩张”。惠灵顿会议公报硬说，“共产党的经济活动显然出于政治动机”，应该加以“揭露”。这真是荒唐之至。谁都知道，社会主义国家的对外经济活动，是以平等互利为原则，以互通有无和促进国际合作为目的的。如果说这里有政治动机的话，那么这种动机又有什么不好呢？相反，帝国主义的对外经济活动，却不仅以疯狂掠夺和剥削为目的，而且总是力图利用它的经济势力，奴役和控制别的国家，达到损人利己的目的。美国强迫许多国家对中国实行“禁运”，企图窒息中国人民；现在又想在反对“共产党经济扩张”的幌子下，破坏中国同亚非国家的正常贸易和经济合作，以便于它自己的真正的经济扩张。这一切活动才是不折不扣地出于最卑鄙的政治动机，应该受到揭露和反对。
    值得注意的是，美国利用东南亚集团策划种种阴谋诡计，不但在亚洲地区到处碰壁，而且在这个集团的内部，也往往不是那么顺利的。惠灵顿会议表明，东南亚集团内部的分歧，特别是以美国为首的帝国主义国家同三个亚洲成员国之间的分歧，已经日益表面化。三个亚洲成员国在这次会议上一再要求加强东南亚条约组织的“经济方面”。这是不难理解的。巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾参加美国军事集团和追随美国扩军备战政策的结果，已经弄得民穷财尽，困难重重，整个国家陷于千疮百孔的地步。甚至连惠灵顿会议公报也承认了成员国“由于防务准备而造成的过分负担”。但是，对于发展这些成员国的独立的经济力量，美国从来是不感兴趣的。会议公报所谓“理事会认识到提高生活水平和提供发展的机会”的重要性，只不过是一句空话。事实上，随着资本主义世界经济危机的发展，美国只会变本加厉地对不发达国家进行掠夺和扩张。不仅这样，美国为了自私的目的，还为东南亚国家介绍了另一个“合作者”，那就是以岸信介政府为代表的日本垄断资本。艾森豪威尔最近公开支持日本向东南亚扩张，这对于东南亚各国人民来说，绝对不是好消息。由此可见，东南亚集团的亚洲成员国想要依赖美国的“援助”来解决它们的经济问题，那只会是一种幻想。
    惠灵顿会议为了掩饰东南亚集团的侵略性质，在它的公报中故意重申成员国“保证谋求用和平手段来解决国际争端，并且在国际关系中不进行威胁”。公报还说，自从东南亚集团成立以来，这个地区的“信任和稳定有了显著的增长”。可是，人们根据东南亚集团的所作所为，只能证明这是一连串的谎话。东南亚集团成立四年多来，究竟谋求过什么样的“和平手段”呢？它不顾亚洲各国人民要求和平共处的普遍愿望，始终拒绝一切爱好和平国家的种种和平建议，而坚持执行美国的扩军备战政策，在亚洲国家的领土上建立美国的军事基地，驻扎美国军队，并经常举行军事演习，恫吓亚洲人民。东南亚集团并且不断地干涉亚洲国家内政，进行颠复活动，威胁这些国家的安全和独立。所有这些当然只会造成亚洲国家之间的对立和亚洲的紧张局势，使亚洲地区的和平长期处于不安定的状态。
    亚洲广大人民已经越来越看清美国所操纵的东南亚集团对亚洲和平的危害。惠灵顿会议所策划的反和平阴谋，已经激起亚洲以及全世界人民的谴责。苏联、越南和朝鲜的声明，以及各国的公正舆论，都一致指出，爱好和平的人民必须进一步团结起来，制止帝国主义在亚洲制造新的紧张局势。亚洲人民，同全世界人民一样，坚决要求实现各国人民之间的和平共处，要求巩固和扩大亚洲的和平地区，要求维护各国人民的独立自由，要求促进各国人民的友好合作。这是一个势不可挡的时代潮流，美国到处拼凑军事集团，坚持“冷战”和侵略政策，是注定没有前途的。那些不顾自己的民族利益，执迷不悟，甘心追随美帝国主义的人们，也将不得不承担美国侵略政策所引起的一切后果。
