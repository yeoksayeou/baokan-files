Comrades Chairman, Representatives, and Committee Members:
　　I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC.
　　Like everyone else, I am participating in the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with great excitement. The simultaneous holding of these two meetings brings together representatives and committee members of all nationalities from all over the country to discuss the major affairs of the country, which vividly demonstrates the unprecedented great unity of the people of all nationalities in our country. This is a meeting of unity and a meeting of great leap forward. Since the First Session of the First National People's Congress in 1954, in the short period of more than four years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have changed the poor, weak, and backward features of old China in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and have achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements. The overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1957 increased by 68% compared with 1952. At the same time, important changes have also taken place in the proportion of industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry. In the total industrial and agricultural output value, the proportion of industry and handicrafts has increased from 41.5% in 1952 to 56.5% in 1957. In the total industrial output value, the proportion of the means of production industry has increased from 37.9% in 1952 to 52.8% in 1957. Thus, it laid a preliminary foundation for the industrialization of our country. Through the movement of the whole-people rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, on the basis of achieving a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, the Chinese Communist Party summed up the experience of the First Five-Year Plan and timely formulated the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, mobilized all positive factors, and inspired the people of the whole country. As a result, in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, that is, in 1958, a comprehensive great leap forward appeared in our national economy and on all fronts. The total industrial and agricultural output value in 1958 increased by 65% compared with 1957. The output of steel, coal, grain, cotton, and other products has increased several times. This amazing leap-forward development is really beyond the reach of capitalist countries. Premier Zhou's report comprehensively summarized the achievements and experiences of the First Five-Year Plan and the great leap forward in 1958, and put forward the task of a greater leap forward in 1959, calling on us to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the national economic plan centered on the four major indicators of 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 1,050 billion catties of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton. I believe that the Party's proposal of this grand annual plan is based on the combination of the objective possibility of material conditions and the subjective initiative of the people in giving full play to hard work, practical work, and skillful work. Under the correct leadership of the Party and under the shining of the general line, the people of our country will surely be able to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the glorious 1959.
　　The 600 million Chinese people are peace-loving and cherish friendship, but they are not weak and will never allow stupid pig snouts to drill into our beautiful garden.
　　This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic of China, and also the tenth anniversary of the world's peace-loving people's movement to safeguard peace. Since the founding of the country, our government and people have made their greatest efforts and outstanding contributions to the lofty cause of defending world peace. The Chinese people and the Soviet people have established unbreakable friendly cooperation, forming a powerful fortress for defending human peace and progress. Consolidating the internationalist unity with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries is our country's fundamental policy. It is precisely because of the close unity of China and the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp; because the Soviet Union and our country and the entire socialist camp have always consistently provided strong support to countries that maintain national independence and carry out national liberation struggles, that the flames of war ignited by imperialism in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East have been extinguished, that the forces of aggression have been suppressed, and that the cause of peace has been guaranteed. Since the founding of the country, our country has pursued a peaceful foreign policy that is in line with the essence of the socialist system, and has consistently followed the principle of peaceful coexistence with countries with different systems in international affairs. Our national leaders have made unremitting efforts at the Geneva Conference, the Bandung Conference, and in their visits to neighboring friendly countries to advocate principles for handling international relations, to uphold international morality and human justice, to eliminate tensions, and to resolve international disputes through peaceful negotiations. Our country has developed good diplomatic relations with a series of newly independent countries in Asia and Africa. Because these countries pursue a policy of peace and neutrality in international affairs, refuse to participate in aggressive military blocs, and refuse to allow aggressive forces to establish military bases within their borders, they have common interests with our country in opposing war, eliminating international tensions, and striving for a peaceful environment to engage in domestic construction. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report this time: "In the common struggle against the imperialist policy of aggression and war, in the common effort to uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, we have extensively established friendship with these countries. We cherish this friendship very much." Practice has proved that for several years, our country has fulfilled its responsibilities of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation with neighboring friendly countries in equal and mutually beneficial trade, in negotiating undetermined borders, in the nationality of overseas Chinese, and in technical assistance for certain economic undertakings. We cherish this friendship, especially the friendship with our friendly neighbor, India, with whom we have never resorted to war for two thousand years. Regrettably, recently a small group of reactionary elements in Tibet attempted to maintain their most barbaric and darkest serf system in Tibet. After they launched a rebellion and suffered a shameful defeat, they fled to India and colluded with imperialists and Indian expansionists to play the trick of so-called Tibetan "independence." The Indian expansionists and many newspapers even issued a cry to interfere in China's internal affairs. Some Indian politicians also expressed "sympathy" for the rebels and "unease" about our country's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. The situation is developing even more severely. On the 18th of this month, in Tezpur, India, a so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" was publicly distributed by Indian diplomatic officials, which is truly shocking! The Indian government is not only condoning the Indian expansionists to carry out anti-China clamor, but also condoning the distribution of this extremely absurd political document that openly attacks the Chinese government. Moreover, recently, some upper-level figures of the Indian ruling party have even carried out vicious slander against our country. Do these activities of betrayal of faith and undermining friendly relations conform to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence? Not only is it not preventing the Tibetan rebel elements from performing the "independence" trick within Indian territory, but on the contrary, it is either cheering from the sidelines or secretly instigating. Is this an attitude that a so-called friendly country should adopt? Tibet has been Chinese territory since ancient times. China maintains its territorial integrity and handles its own internal affairs, yet it is being interfered with by outsiders. Is this something that a nation with self-esteem can tolerate? I want to ask the Indian expansionist gentlemen, what are your plans? Do you think that the Chinese people's repeated concessions and restraint mean that they are weak and can be bullied? Are you so arrogant and think that you can inherit the political mantle of British imperialism and dare to covet China's sacred territory? You have miscalculated! The 600 million Chinese people are peace-loving and cherish friendship, but they are not weak and will never allow stupid pig snouts to drill into our beautiful garden. The Indian expansionists' destruction of Sino-Indian friendship will only benefit imperialism and will not benefit India. In order to safeguard international peace and to abide by peaceful coexistence, I sincerely hope that the Indian politicians in power who co-sponsored the "Panchsheel" will cherish their past reputation, handle the situation well, and avoid falling into the trap of imperialism. The US imperialism recently held a meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Wellington, scheming to link the Manila Treaty with the North Atlantic Treaty and the Baghdad Treaty, these aggressive groups. Their spearhead of aggression is not only aimed at China, but also at India. Everyone knows that the most insidious plot of imperialism is to try every means to divide the unity of the newly independent nationalist countries and the socialist countries, first of all to divide the unity of China and India, in order to achieve their goal of defeating them one by one and ruling by division. We should point out to the Indian expansionists: Your foolish attempt to create a split between China and India, two friendly countries, will only benefit imperialist aggression and will not benefit India.
　　China's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet and its democratic reforms in Tibet are all China's internal affairs, and no external interference is allowed. All fraternal nationalities across the country have the responsibility to help the Tibetan people completely eliminate the rebellion, implement national regional autonomy, and gradually carry out social reforms, so that the political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings in the Tibetan region will advance in tandem with the regions of other nationalities across the country, and will gradually become prosperous and progressive.
　　Representatives and Committee Members: Under the leadership of the glorious, great, and correct Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Chairman Mao, the 600 million people of our country are enthusiastically engaged in socialist construction and are fulfilling their responsibilities for justice, peace, and the lofty cause of mankind. As a member of the people, I feel proud and honored! We are holding a meeting of unity and a meeting of great leap forward here. The warm atmosphere of the meeting gives great encouragement to everyone. Let us sing praises to the Chinese Communist Party, sing praises to the great motherland, hold high the red flag of the great leap forward and continue the great leap forward, and advance victoriously!

    期望印度当权的政治家对当前形势善于自处
    邵力子代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，彭真副委员长的“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”和李维汉副主席的政协常务委员会工作报告。
    我同大家一样，以万分兴奋的心情参加这次第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议。这两个会议的同时举行，使来自全国各地的各民族的代表和委员，聚集一堂，共襄国家大计，这就生动地表明了我国各族人民的空前大团结。这是团结的大会，也是跃进的大会。自一九五四年第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议以来，在不长的四年多的时间里，我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，已经在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面，改变了旧中国贫弱落后的面貌，取得了史无前例的辉煌成就。第一个五年计划的超额完成，一九五七年工农业总产值比一九五二年增加了百分之六十八，同时，工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的比重也发生了重要的变化，在工农业总产值中，工业和手工业所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之四十一点五上升到一九五七年的百分之五十六点五。在工业总产值中，生产资料工业所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之三十七点九上升到一九五七年的百分之五十二点八。从而奠定了我国工业化的初步基础。通过全民整风和反右派斗争的运动，在政治战线、思想战线取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利的基础上，中国共产党总结了第一个五年计划的经验，适时地制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，调动了一切积极因素，鼓舞了全国人民，因而在第二个五年计划的第一年，即一九五八年，出现了我国国民经济和各个战线上的全面大跃进。一九五八年的工农业总产值又比一九五七年增长了百分之六十五，其中钢、煤、粮、棉和其他产品的产量都有成倍的增长。这种惊人的飞跃发展，真使资本主义国家望尘莫及。周总理的报告，全面地总结了第一个五年计划和一九五八年大跃进的成就和经验，并提出了一九五九年更大跃进的任务，号召我们为完成和超额完成以钢产量一千八百万吨、煤产量三亿八千万吨，粮食产量一万零五百亿斤、棉花产量一亿担等四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而奋斗。我相信，党提出这个宏伟的年度计划是依据物质条件的客观可能性和人民群众发挥苦干、实干、巧干的主观能动性，两者相结合而制定的，在党的正确领导下，在总路线的照耀下，光辉的一九五九年，我国人民一定能够争取更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    中国六亿多人民是讲和平的，珍视友谊的，但并不软弱，决不让愚蠢的猪鼻子钻进我们美丽的花园里来
    今年是我们伟大的中华人民共和国建国十周年，也是世界爱好和平人民维护和平运动的十周年。建国以来，我国政府和人民对于保卫世界和平的崇高事业，曾经尽了最大的努力并作出了卓越的贡献。中国人民和苏联人民建立了牢不可破的友好合作，形成了保卫人类和平事业和进步事业的强大堡垒。巩固同苏联和一切社会主义国家的国际主义的团结，是我国的根本方针。正是由于中苏两国和整个社会主义阵营的紧密团结；由于苏联和我国和整个社会主义阵营始终一贯地给予维护民族独立、进行民族解放斗争的国家以有力的支援，才熄灭了帝国主义在东南亚、在东欧、在中近东点燃的战火，才使侵略的势力受到压抑，和平事业得到保障。建国以来，我国奉行与社会主义制度本质相符合的和平外交政策，在国际事务中始终一贯地遵循着与不同制度的国家和平共处的方针。我们国家领导人在出席日内瓦会议上、万隆会议上，以及在邻近友好国家的访问中，对于倡导处理国际关系的原则，维护国际道义和人类正义事业，消除紧张局势，以和平谈判方式解决国际争端问题等等，都曾进行了不懈的努力。我国同亚洲和非洲的一系列新独立的国家发展着良好的外交关系，由于这些国家在国际事务中执行着和平中立的政策，拒绝参加侵略性的军事集团，拒绝侵略势力在境内建立军事基地。他们在反对战争、消除国际紧张局势、争取和平环境以从事国内建设这些方面，同我国具有共同的利益。正如周总理在这次报告中所指出的：“在反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的共同斗争中，在维护和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的共同努力中，我们同这些国家广泛地建立了友谊。我们很珍视这种友谊。”实践证明：若干年来，我们同邻近友好国家在平等互惠的贸易上，在谈判未定界的国界问题上，在华侨的国籍问题上，在若干经济事业的技术援助上，我国克尽了和平共处和友好合作的职责。我们珍视这个友谊，尤其十分珍视两千年来与我国从未诉诸战争的友好的邻邦——印度的友谊。令人遗憾的，最近西藏一小撮反动分子企图维持他们在西藏最野蛮、最黑暗的农奴制度，他们发动叛乱遭到了可耻的失败之后，又逃到印度同帝国主义和印度的扩张主义分子勾结起来，要搞所谓西藏“独立”的把戏，而印度的扩张主义者和不少报纸，竟然发出一片干涉中国内政的叫嚣，印度的某些政治家也对叛乱分子表示“同情”，而对我国平定西藏叛乱表示“不安”。事情还变本加厉地在发展，本月十八日在印度的提斯浦尔地方，出现了由印度外交官员公然散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，真令人万分惊讶！印度政府既纵容印度扩张主义分子进行反对中国的叫嚣，又纵容散发这个十分荒谬的公开攻击中国政府的政治性文件，而且最近印度执政党的一部分上层人物竟然对我国进行恶毒的诽谤，这种种背信弃义、破坏邦交的活动，难道符合于和平共处的五项原则吗？对于西藏叛乱分子在印度境内表演的“独立”把戏不但不加阻止，相反地，或在一旁喝采帮腔，或在暗地发纵指使，难道是一个号称友好国家所应该采取的态度吗？西藏自古是中国的领土，中国维护自己的领土完整，处理自己的内政，竟遭到外人干涉，难道是一个具有自尊心的民族所能容忍的吗？我要问印度的扩张主义者先生们，你们究竟作怎样的打算？你们觉得中国人民一再忍让、克制，便以为懦弱可欺么？你们竟夜郎自大，以为可以继承英帝国主义的政治衣钵，胆敢觊觎中国的神圣领土么？你们的算盘打错了！中国六亿多人民是讲和平的，珍视友谊的，但并不软弱，决不会让愚蠢的猪鼻子钻进我们美丽的花园里来。印度扩张主义分子破坏中印友谊，只会对帝国主义有利，决不会对印度有利为了保卫国际和平，为了遵行和平共处，我殷切地盼望同我国首倡“潘查希拉”的印度当权的政治家珍惜以往声誉，善于自处，以免堕入帝国主义的圈套。美帝国主义最近在惠灵顿举行的东南亚条约组织会议，阴谋策划把马尼拉条约与北大西洋条约、巴格达条约这几个侵略集团联系在一起，它们侵略的矛头决不是单对中国，也要对着印度。大家知道：帝国主义最阴险的图谋，是要想尽一切方法来分化新独立的民族主义国家与社会主义国家的团结，首先要分化中印两大国家的团结，以达到它们各个击破、分而治之的目的。我们应该向印度的扩张主义者指出：你们这样愚蠢地要造成中印两个友好国家的分裂，其结果，只能有利于帝国主义的侵略，而不利于印度。
    中国平定西藏的叛乱，进行西藏的民主改革，都是属于中国的内政，决不容许外人加以干涉。全国各兄弟民族有责任帮助西藏人民彻底消弭叛乱，实行民族区域自治，逐步进行社会改革，使西藏地区的政治、经济和文化等各项事业与全国其他民族的地区齐头并进，日趋于繁荣进步。
    各位代表、各位委员：在光荣、伟大、正确的中国共产党和人民领袖毛主席的领导下，我国六亿多人民正在热火朝天地进行社会主义的建设，正在为正义、和平、为人类的崇高事业而履行职责。作为人民一分子，我感到骄傲和自豪！我们在这里举行团结的大会，跃进的大会，大会的热烈气氛，给予每个人以极大的鼓舞。让我们歌唱中国共产党，歌唱伟大的祖国，举着跃进、再跃进的红旗，胜利前进！
