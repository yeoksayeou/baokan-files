Hearken, Expansionist Elements of India!
Withdraw Your Meddling Black Hands!
To the Editor:
　　Your newspaper's April 21st publication of the Xinhua News Agency political reporter's commentary, "On the So-Called Dalai Lama's Statement," is completely correct, and we express our support.

　　Tibet is Chinese territory, and the rebellion of Tibetan reactionary elements and the quelling of this rebellion are China's internal affairs. This is the truth, and no outsider has the right to interfere.

　　Indian expansionist elements, under the guise of the Dalai Lama, fabricate claims such as "the Tibetan people have always had a strong desire for independence." In the eyes of our six hundred million Chinese people, this is nothing but a shameful lie. Tibetans are Chinese people, and like other ethnic groups in China, they have always loved their motherland. However, the reactionary clique of the Tibetan upper class colluded with imperialism and betrayed the motherland, attempting to plunge the Tibetan people back into misery. This is something our working class will never tolerate.

　　We solemnly warn the expansionist elements of India that you should respect the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and India. The six hundred million Chinese people will never allow interference from any foreigners.

The Victory Will Belong to the Chinese People
Misfortune Will Be the Lot of Those Who Interfere
To the Editor:
　　We can no longer tolerate the recent statements by certain Indian newspapers and expansionist elements interfering in our internal affairs, and we feel it is necessary to counterattack!

　　Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, just as Wales is a part of Britain and Mumbai is a part of India. Therefore, any foreign actions that undermine China's unity, or advocate for Tibetan "independence," attempting to interfere in Tibetan affairs, constitute interference in our internal affairs, and we cannot stand idly by.

　　Recently, certain politicians in India have shown ulterior motives by expressing great "enthusiasm" and "sympathy" for the rebellion of a small number of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, expressing "unease" about China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, and busying themselves among Tibetan rebels, engaging in secretive activities. We warn the expansionist elements of India that the Chinese people are not to be bullied. Trying to put pressure on China is targeting the wrong people. If you insist on acting recklessly, it will not cause us any loss. The rebellion has been basically quelled. The Tibetan people are moving towards prosperity and happiness, and victory belongs to us. Misfortune will be the lot of you expansionist elements and the rebels you support. All words and actions that undermine Sino-Indian friendship will be resolutely opposed by the people of both countries.

Any Attempt to Separate Tibet From the Motherland
Will Be Crushed by the Wheels of History
To the Editor:
　　We—all the drama workers of the China Youth Art Theater—after discussing the so-called "Dalai Lama's Statement," unanimously expressed great contempt and indignation.

　　We believe that Tibet is forever a part of China, and the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is entirely China's internal affair. This is an undeniable fact. Any wishful thinking to separate Tibet from the motherland's big family and obstruct the rebirth of Tibet will be crushed by the wheels of history rolling forward with the force of a thunderbolt.

　　The fact that the Dalai Lama was abducted to India and that the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs distributed this "statement" that distorts history and ignores reality brings great displeasure to our Chinese drama workers who have always strived to promote Sino-Indian art. We protest to the behind-the-scenes directors: your actions have sullied and undermined Sino-Indian friendship, sullied and undermined the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Such activities will only benefit the more despicable activities of colonialists and are detrimental to the sacred "Panchsheel." Our attitude is: on the one hand, we must continue to work hard to promote Sino-Indian cultural exchange and promote Sino-Indian friendship; on the other hand, we must use artistic weapons to oppose all interferers!

### 外国野心家们听着：中国内政决不容他人干涉

    外国野心家们听着：中国内政决不容他人干涉
    警告印度的扩张主义分子：
    收起干涉的黑手吧！编辑同志：
    你报21日发表的新华社政治记者评“所谓达赖喇嘛的声明”一文是完全正确的，我们表示支持。
    西藏是中国的领土，西藏反动分子的叛乱和这一叛乱的平定是中国的内政，这是真理，任何外人也无权过问。
    印度扩张主义分子，假借达赖喇嘛的名义，捏造什么“西藏人一向有一种要求独立的强烈愿望”，这种话在我们六亿中国人民看来，不过是可耻的谎言而已。西藏人是中国人，他们和中国其他各族人民一样一向是热爱祖国的。但是，西藏上层的反动集团勾结帝国主义、叛变祖国，企图把西藏人民重陷于水深火热之中。这是我们工人阶级决不能容忍的。
    我们郑重警告印度的扩张主义分子，你们应当尊重中印共同倡议的和平共处五项原则，六亿中国人民决不容许任何外国人的干涉。
    北京国棉二厂织布甲班
    七、八工区全体工人胜利的将是我们中国人民
    倒霉的将是那些干涉者编辑同志：
    我们对印度某些报刊和扩张主义分子最近干涉我国内政的言论，实在忍无可忍，觉得有必要予以反击！
    西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，正像威尔士是英国的组成部分，孟买是印度的组成部分一样。因此任何外来破坏中国统一，或鼓吹什么西藏“独立”，妄图干涉西藏事务的言行，就是干涉我国内政，我们不能坐视不理。
    最近印度的某些政治家竟然别有用心的对西藏少数上层反动分子的叛乱表示很大的“热心”和“同情”，对我国平定西藏叛乱表示“不安”，并来往奔忙于西藏叛乱分子之间，进行着不可告人的勾当。我们警告印度的扩张主义分子们，中国人不是好欺负的，要想对中国施加压力，是找错了对象。如果你们还要蛮干，对我们来讲，丝毫没有损失。叛乱已经基本平定。西藏人民正在走向繁荣幸福，胜利是属于我们的。倒霉的将是你们这些扩张主义分子以及你们所维护的叛乱分子们。一切破坏中印友谊的言行，都将受到两国人民的坚决反对。
    北京协和医院徐鸣国等四十八人
    任何想使西藏脱离祖国的企图
    都将要被历史车轮辗得粉碎编辑同志：
    我们——中国青年艺术剧院全体话剧工作者，座谈了关于所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”以后，一致表示极大的蔑视和愤慨。
    我们认为，西藏永远是中国的一部分，平息西藏叛乱，完全是中国的内政，这是钢铸铁打的事实。任何使西藏脱离祖国大家庭和阻挠西藏新生的痴心妄想，都将被以雷霆万钧之势向前滚动的历史车轮辗得粉碎。
    达赖喇嘛被劫持到了印度，而且由印度外交部官员散发了这篇歪曲历史、不顾现实的“声明”，这一事实给一向努力传播中印艺术的我国话剧工作者带来极大的不愉快。我们向幕后导演表示抗议：你们的行为沾污和破坏了中印友好，沾污和破坏了和平共处五项原则，这种活动只会有利于殖民主义者的更卑鄙的活动，而不利于圣洁的“潘查希拉”。我们的态度是：一方面要继续努力，促进中印文化交流，促进中印友好；另一方面我们要运用艺术武器，反对一切干涉者！
                  中国青年艺术剧院全体工作人员
