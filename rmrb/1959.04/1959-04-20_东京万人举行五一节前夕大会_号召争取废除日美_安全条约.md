　　Tokyo: Ten Thousand People Hold Pre-May Day Rally
　　Calling for the Abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 18th: Ten thousand workers and citizens in Tokyo enthusiastically held a "Pre-May Day Rally" at the gymnasium building today. Representatives from various sectors who spoke at the meeting expressed their determination to fight for the victory of democratic forces in the local elections and to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    This rally was organized by the "Tokyo Pre-May Day Rally Executive Committee," jointly formed by more than a hundred labor unions and democratic organizations in Tokyo.
    Ushitaro Okamoto, Chairman of the Executive Committee, first addressed the meeting, calling on workers to unite, further develop the labor movement, and strive for the victory of democratic forces in the local elections. Ichizo Suzuki, member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously called for strengthening the struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and to deliver a heavy blow to the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and conservative forces in this local election.
    Suzuki emphasized that Dulles and Adenauer have already stepped down, and in Asia, the time is approaching for the collapse of puppets like Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Nobusuke Kishi.
    Iwai exposed the deceptive nature of the minimum wage law drafted by the Kishi Nobusuke government, which was recently passed by the Diet. He pointed out that we must organize the struggle again to strive for a minimum wage system that can truly guarantee the minimum living standards of workers.
    Hachiro Arita, the Socialist Party's candidate for Governor of Tokyo, called on the people attending the meeting to strengthen unity in the gubernatorial election and work to overthrow the conservative forces. He said that this is the first step in the struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.
    All the attendees responded to the speakers with warm applause.
    Choral performances, dramas, dances, and other cultural programs were also performed at the meeting.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 18th: A commentary published by Japan Press Service stated: "The main purpose of revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is to openly establish a joint defense system between the U.S. and Japan." It pointed out that, under the new security treaty, Japan will be able to participate in U.S. combat activities under the guise of joint exercises and become closely integrated with the U.S. nuclear strategy system.
    The commentary, published in the April 8th issue of the Japan Press Service's weekly, stated that the mission of Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" is clearly written in the "Defense White Paper" published by the "Defense Agency" at the end of 1957. This white paper was drafted under the guidance of U.S. military leaders. The white paper states: "The Self-Defense Forces will be backed by the U.S. military's core attack force as a deterrent force and act as a minimum resistance force in local wars."
    The commentary said that Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" held its largest military exercises last year, including many joint air defense exercises and joint army-air force exercises with U.S. forces stationed in Japan.
    The commentary also pointed out: "The U.S. Air Force stationed in Japan and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force have some military operation agreements, including agreements that the U.S. Air Force can provide advice to the Japan Air Force and invite the Japan Air Force to participate in joint air force exercises. Therefore, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force is effectively under the command of the U.S. military in the Pacific."

　　东京万人举行五一节前夕大会
　　号召争取废除日美“安全条约”
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：东京一万名工人和市民今天在体育馆大厦热烈举行“五一节前夕大会”。在会上讲话的各方面的代表表示要为民主力量在地方选举中获得胜利和阻止修改日美“安全条约”而斗争。
    这个大会是由东京的一百多个工会和民主团体联合组成的“东京五一节前夕大会实行委员会”主持举行的。
    实行委员会委员长冈本丑太郎首先在会上致词，号召工人们团结起来，使工人运动更加发展，并为民主力量在地方选举中获得胜利而努力。日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员铃木市藏和日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章也分别在会上讲话。他们一致号召加强为阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，并且要在这次地方选举中对岸信介内阁和保守势力给以沉重打击。
    铃木强调指出，杜勒斯和阿登纳已经下台，在亚洲，李承晚和蒋介石以及岸信介等傀儡垮台的时期也即将到来。
    岩井揭穿了不久前国会通过的岸信介政府拟制的最低工资法的欺骗性质。他指出，我们必须再一次组织斗争，以争取真正能够保障工人最低生活的最低工资制度。
    社会党东京都知事候选人有田八郎在讲话中号召到会的人们在知事选举中加强团结，为打倒保守势力而努力。他说，这是为打倒岸信介内阁而斗争的第一步。
    全体与会者对讲话者报以热烈的掌声。
    会上还演出了合唱、戏剧、舞蹈等文娱节目。
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本新闻社发表的一篇评论说：“修改日美安全条约的主要目的是要公开建立日美两国的共同防御体制”。它指出，根据新的安全条约，日本将能够在共同演习的幌子下参加美国的作战活动，并且紧密地和美国的原子战略体制结合在一起。
    日本新闻社的周报在4月8日出版的一期发表的这篇评论说，日本“自卫队”的任务已经清楚地写在“防卫厅”于1957年年底发表的
  “国防白皮书”里。这个白皮书是在美国军事首脑们的指导下拟订的。白皮书说：“自卫队将以美军攻击力量的核心阻击力量为后盾，在局部战争中作为最低的抵抗力量。”
    这篇评论说，日本“自卫队”在去年举行了规模最大的军事演习，其中包括许多同驻日美军共同举行的防空演习、陆空军联合演习等。
    评论还指出：“驻日美国空军和日本航空自卫队有着一些军事行动的协议，其中有美国空军可以向日本空军提供建议并邀请日本空军参加联合空军演习的协议。因此，日本航空自卫队实际上处于太平洋的美国军队的指挥之下。”
