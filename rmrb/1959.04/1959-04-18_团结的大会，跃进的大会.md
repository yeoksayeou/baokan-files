　　A Congress of Unity, A Congress of Great Leap Forward
    The First Session of the Second National People's Congress officially opens today. The First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also begins. Representatives from all ethnic groups and all social strata across the country gather in the capital to jointly discuss national affairs. This event itself vividly demonstrates the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. These two congresses will summarize the great achievements of our socialist construction and mobilize the people of the whole country to realize this year's continued Great Leap Forward. These two congresses are congresses of great unity and a Great Leap Forward of all ethnic groups of our country. The convening of these two congresses is a major event in the political life of the people of our country, which is worth celebrating warmly.
    It has only been a little over four years since the First Session of the First National People's Congress. Four years, what a short period in human history. However, in these short four years, tremendous changes have taken place in our country. Looking back, there is a feeling of "how long has it been, the country cannot be recognized again".
    In the past four years, the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country has been unprecedentedly strengthened. In the rural areas across the country, after the realization of cooperativization, the people's commune was realized, which fundamentally solved the contradiction between the individual economy of peasants and the socialist planned economy, thereby strengthening the unity between the working class and peasants, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. In industry and commerce, the public ownership of the means of production replaced the bourgeois ownership of the means of production, which basically solved the economic contradiction between the working people and the industrial and commercial bourgeoisie. The implementation of our Party's policy of mobilizing all positive factors to carry out socialist construction has further developed the alliance between the working people and all non-working people who can cooperate. Thanks to the long-term education against Han chauvinism among Han cadres, and the education against local nationalism among ethnic minorities, and because the vast majority of ethnic minorities have implemented ethnic autonomy and various social reforms in the past few years, the friendly unity between the Han and fraternal ethnic groups, as well as between the fraternal ethnic groups, has been greatly enhanced. The Central People's Government ordered the suppression of the rebellion launched by the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet, safeguarding the unity of the motherland and national unity. The rectification movement that began in the summer of 1957, the debate and education on the two roads of socialism and capitalism, greatly improved the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and people, and greatly improved their relations with each other. The victory of the struggle against the bourgeois rightists and the complete isolation of the rightists among the people not only strengthened our country's people's democratic dictatorship, but also strengthened the unity within the people. All this has further consolidated and developed our country's people's democratic united front. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in our country are united around the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government as never before. The representatives and members attending these two meetings, including a wider range of representatives from all aspects than in the past, is a powerful proof.
    In the past four years, our country's socialist cause has also made great progress. The high tide of agricultural and handicraft cooperativization and the high tide of joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, which were set off across the country from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, and the nationwide rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle that began in the summer of 1957, enabled the people of our country to achieve a decisive and great victory in the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. Simultaneously with these decisive victories, socialist construction has also made extremely great achievements. Our country's first five-year plan, which was once determined to fail by our enemies, was not only successfully completed, but also overfulfilled, thereby laying the initial foundation for our country's industrialization. On this basis, in 1958, the first year of the second five-year plan, the party formulated the general line for building socialism, mobilized the people of the whole country, and realized the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. In 1958, the output of steel, coal, grain, and cotton all increased several times. During the period of the first five-year plan, the total industrial output value of our country increased by an average of 19.2％ per year, and the total agricultural output value increased by an average of 4.2％ per year. This speed was already not low; and in 1958 alone, the total output value of industry and agriculture increased by 66％ and 64％ respectively. This speed is not only unprecedented in our country, but also makes those self-proclaimed most developed capitalist countries that have always looked down on us beyond reach.
    All these achievements fully prove the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Under the socialist system, we have rapidly transformed a country with multiple economic components into a country with a single socialist economy. The socialist system itself guarantees that we can continuously resolve the contradictions within the people, continuously adjust the relations within the people, thereby fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the entire people, greatly unleashing production potential, and carrying out socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Our cause is a glorious and great cause, and the achievements made by our people are unprecedented in the history of our country. However, the tasks before us are still very arduous. Because our country's foundation is "poor and blank," even though our achievements are great, they have not fundamentally changed the "poor" and "blank" face of our country. Compared with many economically and culturally developed countries in the world, our country is still lagging behind in many aspects. Today, our country has indeed undergone earth-shaking changes compared with the poor yesterday of the old society, but it is indeed insignificant compared with the great tomorrow. It will take the people of our country a very arduous effort in ten, fifteen, or more years to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture.
    This year is the second year of the three years of hard struggle. At the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, which opens today, the 1959 national economic construction plan and the 1959 national budget corresponding to this plan will be discussed and finally decided. This plan and budget will reflect the desire of the people of the whole country to realize a continued Great Leap Forward. We have the material and technical foundation accumulated during the first five-year plan period, especially in the Great Leap Forward of 1958; we have the soaring enthusiasm of the closely united people of the whole country; and we have the great assistance of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries: these are all favorable conditions for realizing the 1959 national economic plan. As long as we have both a vigorous revolutionary spirit and a down-to-earth work style; both full confidence in completing the plan and practical and reliable specific measures, then we will surely win another Great Leap Forward in 1959.
    This National People's Congress will also elect new leaders of the state organs. The CPC Central Committee has, based on Comrade Mao Zedong's suggestion, agreed that he will not be a candidate for Chairman of the People's Republic of China in this session. The Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee, which was held not long ago, has decided on the nominations for the leaders of the state organs in this session, and has consulted with all parties in the past few days.
    Whether in the past or in the future, we need to rely on the united strength of all patriotic people to achieve any success. The great unity of more than 600 million people is an important guarantee for the consolidation and development of our country, and it is the source of creating the miracle of the Great Leap Forward. In the past, we united all those who could be united, and thus achieved victory in the revolutionary struggle and production construction; in the future, we must continue to work tirelessly for this. The convening of this National People's Congress and the National Committee of the CPPCC will further strengthen the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country.
    We have already made great achievements, and we must continue to make great achievements. We are always confident optimists because we always believe in the masses of the people. Our future is infinitely bright, and the tasks are extremely arduous. On this great road forward, it is impossible to have no difficulties. Comrade Mao Zedong often tells us to despise difficulties strategically and pay attention to difficulties tactically. The communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, which has been universally advocated since last year, must of course continue to be carried forward. What needs to be emphasized at present is to seriously treat difficulties and resolutely guard against arrogance and complacency. "Our people should work hard, study hard the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, be honest and diligent, encourage and help each other, resolutely guard against any exaggeration and pride, and prepare to build our country, which is now economically and culturally backward, into an industrialized great country with a high degree of modern culture within several five-year plans." These words spoken by Comrade Mao Zedong in the opening speech of the First Session of the First National People's Congress are still the guide for the struggle of the people of our country today.
    Now, the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have opened! We firmly believe that these two congresses will make significant contributions to the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and the Great Leap Forward in 1959. We wish these two congresses success. Let us unite more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, and strive for greater victories in 1959!

### 团结的大会，跃进的大会

　　团结的大会，跃进的大会
    第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议今天正式开幕。中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议也开始举行。来自全国各地的各个民族的各个社会阶层的代表人物，云集首都，济济一堂，共襄国家大计。这件事情本身，就生动地表明了我国各民族人民的大团结。这两个大会将总结我国社会主义建设的巨大成就，动员全国人民实现今年的继续大跃进。这两个大会，是我国各民族人民大团结的大会，大跃进的大会。这两个大会的召开，是我国人民政治生活中的值得热烈欢庆的大事。
    第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议以来，只有四年多的时间。四年，这在人类历史上是一个多么短暂的时期。可是，就在这短短的四年内，我们的国家却发生了巨大的变化。回顾既往，真有“曾几何时，江山不可复识”的感觉。
    四年多来，我国各民族人民的团结空前地加强了。在全国农村，在实现了合作化之后又实现了人民公社化，这就从根本上解决了农民个体经济同社会主义计划经济之间的矛盾，从而加强了工人阶级同农民之间的团结，巩固了工农联盟。在工商业中生产资料的全民所有制代替了生产资料的资产阶级所有制，使劳动人民同工商业资产阶级之间经济上的矛盾基本上解决了。我们党的调动一切积极因素进行社会主义建设的方针的贯彻执行，使劳动人民同一切可以合作的非劳动人民之间的联盟有了进一步的发展。由于在汉族干部中进行了反对大汉族主义的长期教育，少数民族中又进行了反对地方民族主义的教育，由于绝大多数少数民族在过去几年中实行了民族自治和各项社会改革，汉族同各兄弟民族之间以及各兄弟民族相互之间的友好团结大大增强了。中央人民政府下令平定西藏上层反动集团所发动的叛乱，维护了祖国的统一和民族团结。1957年夏季开始的整风运动，关于社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的辩论和教育，使广大干部和群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高了，他们相互之间的关系大大改进了。反对资产阶级右派的斗争的胜利，右派分子在人民群众中完全孤立了，这不但加强了我国的人民民主专政，也加强了人民内部的团结。所有这一切，都使我国的人民民主统一战线获得了进一步的巩固和发展。现在，我国各民族人民，空前紧密地团结在中国共产党和中央人民政府周围。出席这两个会议的代表和委员，包括了比过去更广泛的各方面的代表人物，就是一个有力的证明。
    四年多来，我国的社会主义事业，也有了巨大的发展。1955年冬到1956年春，在全国范围内掀起的农业、手工业合作化的高潮和资本主义工商业实行公私合营的高潮，和1957年夏天开始的全民整风运动和反右派斗争，使我国人民在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上取得了社会主义革命的决定性的伟大胜利。与这些决定性的胜利同时，社会主义建设也取得了极伟大的成就。曾经被我们的敌人断定要失败的我国第一个五年计划不但胜利完成，而且超额完成，从而奠定了我国工业化的初步基础。在这个基础上，在1958年，也就是第二个五年计划的第一年，党制定了建设社会主义的总路线，动员全国人民，实现了工农业生产的大跃进。1958年的钢、煤、粮食和棉花的产量，都有成倍的增长。在第一个五年计划期间，我国工业总产值平均每年增长19.2％，农业总产值平均每年增长4.2％，这个速度已经是不低的了；而在1958年的一年中，工农业的总产值更分别增长66％和64％。这种速度，不仅在我国是空前的，就是对于那些一向瞧不起我们的自命不凡的最发达的资本主义国家来说，也使它们望尘莫及。
    所有这些成就都充分证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。在社会主义的制度下，我们已经迅速地把多种经济成分的国家，改造成为单一的社会主义经济的国家。社会主义制度本身，保证我们有可能不断地解决人民内部矛盾，不断调整人民内部的关系，从而充分地调动全体人民的积极性，大大地发挥生产潜力，多快好省地进行社会主义建设。
    我们的事业是光荣伟大的事业，我们的人民所取得的成就在我国历史上是前所未有的。可是，摆在我们面前的任务，仍然十分艰巨。由于我们国家的底子是“一穷二白”，我们的成就纵然很大，也还没有根本改变我们国家“穷”和“白”的面貌。比起世界上很多经济文化发达的国家来，我们国家在很多方面还是落后的。我们国家的今天，比起旧社会的穷困的昨天，确实有了翻天覆地的变化，可是比起伟大的明天，又确实是微不足道的。把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，需要我国人民在十年、十五年或者更多一些的时间内作十分艰巨的努力。
    今年是苦战三年的第二年。在今天开幕的第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，将要讨论和最后决定1959年国民经济建设计划，以及和这个计划相适应的1959年国家预算。这个计划和预算将体现全国人民实现继续大跃进的意愿。我们有第一个五年计划期间、特别是1958年大跃进中积累的物质技术基础；有紧密团结的全国人民的冲天干劲；还有苏联和各兄弟国家的伟大援助：这些都是实现1959年国民经济计划的有利条件。只要我们既有轰轰烈烈的革命干劲，又有踏踏实实的工作作风；既有完成计划的充分信心，又有切实可靠的具体措施，那末，我们就一定能在1959年再赢得一个大跃进。
    这次人民代表大会，还将选举新的国家机构领导人员。中共中央已经根据毛泽东同志的建议，同意他不作为这一届中华人民共和国主席的候选人。不久前召开的中共中央八届七中全会，已决定了这一届的国家机构领导人员候选人的提名，并且已经在过去几天中同各方面进行了协商。
    无论在过去或者在今后，我们要取得任何的成就，都需要依靠全体爱国人民团结一致的力量。六亿多人民的大团结，是我们国家巩固和发展的重要保证，是创造大跃进奇迹的源泉。过去，我们团结了一切能够团结的人，因而取得了革命斗争和生产建设的胜利；今后，我们也一定要继续为此而努力不懈。这次人民代表大会和政协全国委员会的召开，将进一步加强全国各民族人民的大团结。
    我们已经取得了巨大的成就，还要继续取得巨大的成就。我们永远是信心充沛的乐观主义者，因为我们永远相信人民群众。我们的前途无限远大，任务极其繁重。在这个伟大的前进道路上，不可能没有困难。毛泽东同志经常告诉我们，战略上要藐视困难，战术上要重视困难。去年以来普遍提倡的敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格当然还要继续发扬。目前需要十分强调的是要认真地对待困难，力戒骄傲自满。“我国人民应当努力工作，努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，准备在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。”毛泽东同志在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的开幕词中所讲的这些话，依然是今天我国人民奋斗的指针。
    现在，第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议开幕了！我们深信，这两个大会将对我国各民族人民的大团结和1959年的大跃进作出重大贡献。我们预祝这两个大会的成功。让我们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，更加紧密地团结起来，为争取1959年的更大的胜利而奋斗！
