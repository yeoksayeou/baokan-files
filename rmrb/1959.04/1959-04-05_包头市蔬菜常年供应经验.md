Baotou is one of China's heavy industrial bases. In recent years, with the rapid development of the industrial base, the population has also increased sharply. This new situation has brought many new problems to the industrial base that has risen from the ground up. Vegetable production and supply are among them. Vegetables are related to the vital lives of the vast number of workers and the masses, and are both an economic and a political matter. While concentrating our main efforts on building industrial bases, we must also appropriately meet the needs of workers and the masses for vegetables. The solution is mainly to increase vegetable production, supplemented by transfer and regulation. The characteristics of the Baotou area are: cold weather, little rain, strong winds and sand, high altitude, and low temperature, with a frost-free period of only about 130 days. Therefore, vegetables cannot be grown in the open field for seven months of the year, which makes vegetable production unable to adapt to objective needs. In the past few years, in the face of this situation, Baotou has taken many effective measures, mainly to increase vegetable production, supplemented by transfer and regulation, thereby basically ensuring the minimum requirements of workers and the masses for vegetables.

What measures has Baotou taken in its vegetable production and supply work to achieve year-round vegetable supply?

First, strengthened organizational leadership measures. With the development of industrial construction and the rapid increase of population, solving the vegetable problem has become a very important political task. The Party and government here have put vegetable production and sales on the agenda; and clarified the policy, and made a resolution at the Municipal Party Congress and the Municipal People's Congress to "work hard for three years to build a non-staple food base"; and often have the secretary in charge, the mayor in charge, and the heads of the Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, the Bureau of Commerce, the suburban Party committee secretary, and the district head personally lead the vegetable production and sales work, and also engage in experimental fields. From the perspective of the production department, the Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy and the suburbs have set up special personnel to manage non-staple food production, and townships and cooperatives also have special personnel to manage it; the commercial department also has special administrative agencies and management departments. This has formed a strong organizational leadership structure for vegetable production and sales.

While strengthening organizational leadership, the following methods were also adopted here:

1.  Highlighting water and fertilizer. To develop new vegetable fields, we must "prepare soldiers and horses, and food and grass go first". Water and fertilizer are the main keys to developing vegetables.

2.  Solving technical problems. In the past, Baotou not only had no experience in growing vegetables, but also its field management was very extensive. In the past few years, the method of "sending out and inviting in" has been adopted to impart technology, and people have been sent to fraternal cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Anshan to visit and study, with a total of 123 people.

3.  To do a good job in vegetable supply, it is not only necessary to have a large quantity, but also a wide variety to meet the needs of the majority of consumers. The number of vegetable varieties has increased from 18 in 1953 to 23 in 1958.

4.  To lead vegetable production and sales work, we must act early and take the initiative, otherwise we will be passive. In arranging production and sales, we have held production and sales cooperation meetings before sowing and during the growing season, so as to avoid the large-scale backlog and out-of-stock of vegetables.

While strengthening organizational leadership, Baotou also grasped production measures. According to our experience, advancing, delaying, and arranging in the middle is a very important measure to solve the balanced supply throughout the year. In the past, farmers here had an old rule of growing vegetables, that is, spring planting and autumn harvest, leaving everything to fate, which could not make fresh vegetables continuously available throughout the year, but rather caused a severe shortage in the off-season and slow sales in the busy season. The main problem in the Baotou area is that the off-season is too long, but after adopting the experience of the Dalian and Lushun cities of advancing, delaying, and arranging in the middle in 1956, the off-season was greatly shortened, and the situation of concentrated marketing of some small vegetables in July, causing backlogs, was alleviated. It has been proven in the past two years that this is an important method to solve the year-round supply in a faster, better, and more economical way.

Strengthening "protected land" vegetable production is also one of the basic measures to regulate the supply of vegetables in the off-season. In areas with cold climates and short growing seasons, vegetable "protected land" cultivation accounts for a very important proportion in solving the year-round supply of vegetables. Last year, people here could eat three ounces of fresh vegetables produced in "protected land" every day in winter.

    包头市蔬菜常年供应经验
    包头市农林水利局
    包头市是我国的重工业基地之一，几年来，随着工业基地建设的飞跃发展，人口也在急剧增加。这样的新形势，给平地起家的工业基地，带来不少的新问题。蔬菜生产和供应，就是其中的一个。蔬菜是关系广大职工和群众切身生活的问题，是经济工作，也是政治工作。我们在集中主要力量建设工业基地的同时，也必须适当满足职工群众对蔬菜的需要。解决的办法，主要是增加蔬菜生产。而包头地区的特点是：天寒、雨少、风砂大、海拔高、气温低，无霜期仅一百三十天左右。因此全年有七个月不能露地栽培蔬菜，更使蔬菜的生产不能适应客观需要。几年来，面对着这种情况，包头采取了不少有效措施，主要是增加蔬菜生产，辅之以调入调剂，从而基本上保证了职工群众对蔬菜的起码要求。
    包头在蔬菜生产供应工作中，采取哪些措施而达到蔬菜周年供应呢？
    第一是加强了组织领导措施。随着工业建设的发展和人口的迅速增加，解决蔬菜问题，已经成为一项十分重要的政治任务。这里的党、政已经把蔬菜产、销工作提到议事日程上来了；并明确了方针，在市党代表大会和市人民代表大会作了“苦战三年建成副食品基地”的决议；并经常有书记抓，市长管，农林水利局长、商业局长、郊区党委书记、区长都亲自领导蔬菜产、销工作，并搞了试验田。从生产部门来看，农林水利局、郊区都设了专人管理副食品生产，乡、社也有专人管理；在商业部门也设有专管行政机构和经营部门。这就形成了对蔬菜产、销工作的强有力的组织领导机构。
    这里在加强组织领导的同时，还采取了以下办法：
    1、突出抓水、肥。发展新菜田，必须“兵马未动，粮草先行”，水、肥是发展蔬菜的主要关键。
    2、解决技术问题。包头过去不但种蔬菜没有经验，就是大田经营也很粗放。几年来这里采取了“派出去，请进来”办法来传授技术，先后派人到北京、天津、鞍山等兄弟城市参观学习，人数达一百二十三人。
    3、做好蔬菜供应不但要数量多，而且还要品种多，才能满足广大消费者需要。在增加蔬菜品种上已由1953年十八种增加到1958年的二十三种。
    4、领导蔬菜产、销工作，必须早动主动，否则就要被动。在安排产、销上，我们都在播种前和生长期召开了产、销协作会议，这样就避免了蔬菜的大量积压和脱销。
    在加强组织领导的同时，包头还抓了生产上的措施。根据我们的体会，提前、延后、中间排开，是解决全年均衡供应的一项十分重要的措施。以往这里农民种菜有个老规矩，就是春种秋收、听天由命，不能使鲜菜周年供应不断，而是淡季奇缺，忙季滞销。包头地区主要的是淡季过长，可是在1956年采取旅大市提前、延后、中间排开的经验生产以后，大大缩短了淡季，并缓和了7月份一部分小菜集中上市造成积压的情况。二年来证明，这是多快好省的解决周年供应的一个重要方法。
    加强“保护地”蔬菜生产，也是调剂淡季蔬菜供应的基本措施之一。在气候寒冷，生长期短的地区，蔬菜“保护地”栽培对解决蔬菜周年供应上，占着很重要很大的比重。去年这里的人们在冬天每天也能吃到“保护地”生产的三两鲜菜。
