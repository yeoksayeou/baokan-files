The Second National People's Congress Budget Committee, after listening to Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft, conducted a detailed review of the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft. Now, on behalf of the Budget Committee, I will report the results of the review as follows:

The Budget Committee believes that the execution of the 1958 national budget was good. The 1958 National Final Accounts show a total revenue of 41.86 billion yuan and a total expenditure of 40.96 billion yuan, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 900 million yuan. Both revenue and expenditure greatly exceeded the original budget. Since the founding of the People's Republic, the annual increase in China's fiscal revenue has averaged around 3.5 billion yuan, but the increase in 1958 compared to 1957 exceeded 10 billion yuan. While revenue increased, expenditure in 1958 also increased by more than 10 billion yuan. This rate of increase in revenue and expenditure in the 1958 National Final Accounts clearly demonstrates the tremendous leap forward in national finance based on the great leap in production.

The Budget Committee believes that the good results achieved by the national finance in 1958, as pointed out by the delegates in their discussions, are a victory for the general line of socialist construction and a victory for the overall great leap forward in the national economy. The rapid increase in fiscal revenue in 1958 was mainly due to the high-speed development of production in state-owned enterprises and the reduction of enterprise costs, and not due to increased burdens on the people. In terms of the use of fiscal funds in 1958, the portion exceeding the budget was mainly used for production and construction, rather than for non-productive expenditures. Moreover, all departments and regions generally implemented the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, saving various expenditures, improving the effectiveness of the use of funds, and achieving the requirements of developing socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The achievements are very significant.

The Budget Committee recommends that the National People's Congress approve the 1958 National Final Accounts submitted by the State Council.

The 1959 National Budget Draft submitted by the State Council shows revenue and expenditure of 52.001 billion yuan each, an increase of more than 10 billion yuan over 1958. The Budget Committee has carefully reviewed the 1959 National Budget Draft and believes that this budget is one that continues to implement the increase production and practice economy campaign, supports the continued leap forward in the national economy, and is a peaceful, construction-oriented, and great leap forward budget, as well as an active and reliably based budget. This budget reflects the prosperous and thriving scene of our country, fully embodies the strong will of the Chinese people to continue to accelerate socialist construction, and embodies the spirit of implementing the combination of centralized leadership and decentralized management under the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game," ensuring the requirements of national key construction and also taking into account the needs of various secondary construction aspects. The realization of this budget will ensure that China's socialist construction cause will achieve even more brilliant victories in 1959.

In the 1959 national budget revenue, payments from state enterprises account for 87.9 percent. The continuous improvement of the management level of state-owned enterprises is of decisive significance for the completion of the national budget. Therefore, in 1959, we must further implement the mass line in enterprises, fully promote the enthusiasm of cadres and workers, strengthen economic accounting, strengthen the production management and financial management of enterprises, actively tap potentials, vigorously improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and strive to increase enterprise revenue on the basis of high output and high quality, to ensure the victorious completion of the national budget.

In the 1959 national budget expenditures, expenditures for economic construction and social, cultural, and educational undertakings account for 72 percent, expenditures for national defense account for 11.2 percent, and expenditures for administrative management account for 5.2 percent. The vast majority of the national budget expenditures are used to develop the economy and culture, while the proportion of defense spending and administrative management expenses in the entire national budget is lower than last year. The arrangement of the 1959 national budget powerfully illustrates that the Chinese people are engaged in a great peaceful construction undertaking, which forms a clear contrast to the arms expansion and war preparation budgets of imperialist countries.

In the 1959 national budget expenditures, basic construction investments for economic construction, social, cultural, and educational aspects totaled 27 billion yuan, accounting for 52% of the total expenditure, which is an important guarantee for realizing the continued leap forward in socialist construction in 1959. All departments and regions should, under the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game" and overall planning, take all effective measures to complete this year's basic construction plan with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

The 1959 national budget arrangements provide necessary support for rural people's communes. The rural people's communes have been established for less than a year, and they have already fully demonstrated their superiority. In 1959, the state continued to adopt a policy of stabilizing burdens on rural people's communes. The proportion of the burden borne by the people's communes in the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations will decrease from 7 percent last year to 5.2 percent this year. On the other hand, the state also allocated 1 billion yuan from the budget to support the people's communes, mainly to help people's communes and production teams with originally weak economic foundations to develop production and expand construction. These two measures will inevitably help accelerate the development of the commune's production cause.

Based on the above situation, the Budget Committee is satisfied with the arrangements for the 1959 national budget and recommends that the National People's Congress approve this budget and authorize the State Council to adjust the budget in a timely manner according to the changes in the situation during the budget implementation process, as needed and as possible. When weak links are discovered, the state finance should, in conjunction with the available manpower and material resources, increase necessary investment to promote the better and more planned and proportionate development of the national economy.

The current political and economic situation is extremely favorable, and the revolutionary zeal and production enthusiasm of the people throughout the country are booming. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and through the concerted efforts of the people of all nationalities throughout the country in accordance with the Party's general line for socialist construction, the 1959 national economic plan and national budget can certainly be completed and overfulfilled. The above opinions are submitted to the congress for review.

    第二届全国人民代表大会预算委员会关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的审查报告
    第二届全国人民代表大会预算委员会主任委员　曾山
    第二届全国人民代表大会预算委员会，在听了国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告以后，对一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案进行了详细的审查。现在，我代表预算委员会将审查的结果报告如下：
    预算委员会认为，一九五八年国家预算的执行情况是良好的。一九五八年国家决算，总收入四百一十八亿六千万元，总支出四百零九亿六千万元，收入大于支出九亿元，收入和支出都大大超过了原来的预算。开国以来，我国每年财政收入增长的数额，平均在三十五亿元左右，一九五八年比一九五七年增长数额却超过了一百亿元。在收入增长的同时，一九五八年的支出也增加了一百亿元以上。一九五八年国家决算收支的这种增长速度，很清楚地表明了这一年国家财政在生产大跃进基础上的巨大跃进。
    一九五八年国家财政获得这样良好的成绩，正如各位代表在讨论中所指出的，这是社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是国民经济全面大跃进的胜利。一九五八年财政收入的迅速增长，主要是依靠国营企业生产的高速度发展和企业成本的降低，并不是由于增加人民负担。这一年，在财政资金的使用方面，超过预算的部分主要是用于生产建设，而不是用于非生产性的开支。而且各部门、各地区一般都执行了勤俭建国、勤俭办企业和勤俭办一切事业的方针，节约了各项开支，提高了资金的使用效果，实现了少花钱，多办事，多快好省地发展社会主义建设事业的要求，成绩是非常显著的。
    预算委员会建议，全国人民代表大会批准国务院所提出的一九五八年国家决算。
    国务院提出的一九五九年国家预算草案，收入和支出都是五百二十亿零一千万元。比一九五八年各增加一百亿元以上。预算委员会详细地审查了一九五九年国家预算草案，认为这个预算是一个继续贯彻增产节约，支持国民经济继续跃进的预算，是一个和平的、建设的、大跃进的预算，是一个积极的、有可靠根据的预算。这个预算反映了我们国家繁荣昌盛、欣欣向荣的景象，充分体现了我国人民继续加快社会主义建设的强烈意志，体现了在“全国一盘棋”的原则下，贯彻执行集中领导和分级管理相结合的精神，既保证国家重点建设的要求，也照顾了各项次要建设方面的需要。这个预算的实现，将保证一九五九年我国的社会主义建设事业取得更为辉煌的胜利。
    一九五九年国家预算的收入，来自国家企业的缴款占百分之八十七点九。国营企业经营管理水平的不断提高，对于国家预算的完成具有决定性的意义。因此，一九五九年必须在企业中进一步贯彻执行群众路线，充分发扬干部和职工群众的积极性，加强经济核算，加强企业的生产管理和财务管理工作，积极挖掘潜力，大力提高劳动生产率，降低成本，力争在高产优质的基础上，增加企业的收入，保证国家预算的胜利完成。
    一九五九年国家预算的支出，用于经济建设和社会文教事业方面的支出占百分之七十二，用于国防方面的支出占百分之十一点二，用于行政管理方面的支出占百分之五点二。国家预算支出的绝大部分用来发展经济文化事业，而国防费和行政管理费在整个国家预算中所占的比重都比上年有所降低。一九五九年国家预算支出作这样的安排，有力地说明了我国人民正在从事巨大的和平建设事业，它同帝国主义国家的扩军备战的预算形成了一个鲜明的相反的对照。
    一九五九年国家预算的支出，用于经济建设、社会文教等方面的基本建设投资共为二百七十亿元，占总支出的52％，这是实现一九五九年社会主义建设继续跃进的重要保证。各部门、各地区应当在“全国一盘棋”、统筹安排的原则下，采取一切有效措施，多快好省地完成今年的基本建设计划。
    一九五九年国家预算的安排，对于农村人民公社给了必要的支持。现在农村人民公社成立还不到一年，它已经充分地显示了优越性。一九五九年国家对农村人民公社继续采取了稳定负担的政策，人民公社负担占农副业总产值的比例，将由去年的百分之七下降为今年的百分之五点二。另一方面，国家还从预算中，拨出十亿元支援人民公社，主要帮助原来经济底子较薄的人民公社和生产队发展生产，扩大建设。这两方面的措施，必然会给加快公社生产事业的发展以帮助。
    根据上述情况，预算委员会对一九五九年国家预算的安排表示满意，建议全国人民代表大会批准这个预算，并授权国务院在预算执行过程中，根据情况的变化，按照需要和可能，及时地调整预算。在发现薄弱环节的时候，国家财政要结合当时人力、物力的情况，增加必要的投资，以促进国民经济更好地有计划按比例地发展。
    目前的政治经济形势都极为有利，全国人民的革命干劲和生产热情正在蓬勃发展。我们相信，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，经过全国各族人民按照党的社会主义建设总路线一致努力，一九五九年的国民经济计划和国家预算一定可以完成和超额完成。以上意见，请大会审查。
