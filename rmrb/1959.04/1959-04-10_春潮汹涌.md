The Spring Tide is Surging
	Lin Bi

	Even when the bitter winds and snows were still howling, people said: There is no winter in the era of the Great Leap Forward. Sure enough, in factories and mines, people never stopped moving; in the countryside, the drums of war for accumulating fertilizer and preparing for planting never ceased. Thus, we greeted and saw off the first quarter of this year in a lively manner. Now, the spring tide is surging, ten thousand horses are galloping, red flags are fluttering, spirits are high, everyone is of one mind, and everything is going smoothly, forming a vigorous and massive upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy.

	We seem to be immersed in a battlefield with drums and gongs sounding in unison. The sound of the war drums is deafening, and the red flag spectrum dazzles us. We have heard the bold statements at those competition meetings and seen the production targets rising along the red arrows. We have seen steelworkers advancing valiantly on the production and construction front, and coal miners have already overfulfilled their production plans for the first quarter. We have seen mechanical workers concentrating all their efforts on attacking the six major equipment projects; we have also seen spring wheat sown in the north, and early rice transplanted in the south. Cotton has just been planted at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, and cotton has already sprouted on both sides of the Red River.

	Looking at the rivers and mountains, the spring scenery is boundless. This lively situation is the best time to win a decisive victory. Time waits for no one, and opportunities must not be missed. It is urging people to advance victoriously and fight the battle of the second quarter. "Time" is indeed unforgiving. It doesn't care whether you are ready or what you think of it; it always moves forward according to its own laws, without stopping for even a second. Losing time and missing the good spring is something that no one can make up for. As for "opportunity," it is even more fleeting. Complex things and diverse scenes require you to distinguish the mainstream and grasp the main contradictions. A moment of relaxation, a missed opportunity, and it will be "too late to regret." As the saying goes, "After this village, there will be no such shop." Shops will naturally still exist, but they are no longer what you need.

	Eternal spring always belongs to those who tirelessly create it; only those brave warriors who dare to face the tide can catch up.

	Our heroes on all fronts are precisely such people. They are all clear-headed and down-to-earth realists. They are seizing every minute and second, not letting go of any good opportunity. Haven't many factories and mines proposed to complete the state plan on a shift-by-shift and day-by-day basis? In the April 9th newspaper, we read the good news that the workers of the Youth No. 1 Machine Group of the Tianjin Paper Mill were racing against time, not letting go of every ounce, and completing the plan shift by shift and day by day. From this one group, can't we see the tide of industrial production in the second quarter? On the vast plains of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, winter wheat, under the careful care of the people, has passed one barrier after another and is growing vigorously like children in kindergarten, with many ears per stalk and full grains, and we seem to already smell the fragrance of wheat for miles.

	However, they are also passionate romantics. They are far-sighted, not only seeing today but also seeing tomorrow. They are down-to-earth but also have a magnificent spirit. Precisely because they have found the key to the door to the future and have seen the colorful and splendid picture of the future, they can so accurately and tightly grasp every key to the present, becoming masters of nature. They can also see the warmth of spring and fragrant flowers in the severe winter, and in this spring-like second quarter, they can foresee the good news of completing this year's state plan ahead of schedule at the end of the year.

    春潮汹涌
    林碧
    当严寒的风雪还在呼啸着的季节，人们就说过：大跃进的年代没有冬天。果然，在工厂矿山，人们丝毫没有停过脚步，在农村，积肥备耕的战鼓敲个不歇，就这样热热闹闹地迎来了又送走了今年的第一季度。如今，春潮汹涌，万马奔腾，红旗招展，群情振奋，上下一心，左右逢源，正形成一个轰轰烈烈大搞增产节约的局面。
    我们仿佛投身在金鼓齐鸣的战场上。战鼓声震耳欲聋，红旗谱使我们眼花缭乱。我们听到了那些比武大会上的豪言壮语，看到了生产指标沿着红箭头上升。我们看到了钢铁工人在生产和建设战线上分兵猛进，看到煤矿工人已经超额完成了第一季度的生产计划，看到了机械工人正在集中全力进攻六大设备；我们也看到北方播种了春麦，南方插罢了早秧。天山脚下的棉花刚种下，红河两岸的棉花已经破土了。
    极目河山，春色无边。这热热闹闹的局面，正是赢得决定性胜利的最好的时机，时不再来，机不可失，正催促着人们乘胜前进，打响第二季度这一仗。“时”的确是不饶人的，它不管你有没有准备好，不管你对它是什么样的看法，它总是要按自己的规律，一分一秒也不停歇地往前走。丧失了时间，错过了大好春光，那是任凭谁也补不起来的。至于“机”，更是稍纵即逝。错综复杂的事物，千差万别的景象，需要你辨清主流，抓住主要矛盾。一放松，错过了机会，那就“悔之晚矣”。俗话说，“过了这个村，就没有这个店。”店，自然还会有，但那已经不再是你所需要的了。
    永恒的春天，永远是属于那些不懈地创造着春光的人们；能够迎着潮头赶上去的，也只有那些胆大心细的勇士。
    我们的各个战线上的英雄们，正是这样的人。他们都是头脑清醒、脚踏实地的现实主义者。他们正紧紧地抓住每分每秒，不放过一切良机。许多工矿不是都提出按班按日地完成国家计划吗？就在4月9日的报上，我们读到天津造纸总厂青年一号机小组工人分秒必争、斤两不让、班班日日完成计划的喜讯，从这一个小组，难道我们不能看到第二季度工业大生产的潮头吗？在长江黄河的广阔平原上，冬小麦在人们细心护理下，过了一关又一关，像幼儿园的孩子们一样茁壮地成长，穗穗粒多，粒粒饱满，我们仿佛已经闻到千里麦香了。
    然而他们又都是热情洋溢的浪漫主义者。他们高瞻远瞩，不仅看到今天也看到明天，他们脚踏实地却又气壮山河。正因为他们找到了通往未来大门的钥匙，看清了那未来的五彩绚烂的画面，他们才那样准确而又紧紧地抓住当前的每一个主要关键，成为自然的主人。他们也才能够在严冬看到春暖花香，而在这春光似锦的第二季度，就能预见到年终时提前超额完成今年的国家计划的喜报了。
