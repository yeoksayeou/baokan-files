Comrades Chairman, Representatives, and Committee Members:
	I fully endorse the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, the Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959 made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference delivered by Vice Chairman Li Weihan at the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. These reports comprehensively summarize the achievements and experiences of our country's Great Leap Forward since the First Session of the First National People's Congress more than four years ago, especially in 1958, and put forward the grand tasks for 1959. They centrally express the common will and aspirations of the people of our country, and also encourage the people of our country to contribute all their strength to the completion of a greater leap forward in 1959.
	Only a little over four years have passed since the First Session of the First National People's Congress in 1954, and our country has undergone tremendous positive changes. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country have achieved brilliant achievements in both the socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, and various constructions throughout the country in 1958 under the brilliant guidance of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction. This has achieved the unprecedented miracle of doubling the output of several major products compared to 1957, rapidly changing the face of industrial and agricultural production in our country, and creating and universally establishing in the countryside the best social organizational form that combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrates government and commune -- the people's commune, which is suitable for the current situation and future development of our country. This has more powerfully promoted the continued development of our country's productive forces and accelerated the victorious advance of socialist construction. The two documents recently published by the State Statistical Bureau, the "Communiqué on the Implementation Results of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" and the "Communiqué on the Development of the National Economy in 1958," fully illustrate these facts. The year of the Great Leap Forward in our country is not only unprecedented in our country's history, but also has written a glorious and brilliant page in human history. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we have a hundredfold confidence that we will catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the shortest possible time.
	While achieving great victories on various fronts at home, in international affairs, our country, together with the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and with all peace-loving countries and peoples, has made tremendous efforts for the cause of safeguarding world peace and has achieved brilliant achievements. The fraternal relations of friendship, unity, and mutual assistance between our country and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have greatly developed; the good diplomatic relations between our country and a series of newly independent countries in Asia and Africa are also developing day by day; the number of countries that have established diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with our country is also increasing day by day; and the policy of the United States imperialism to isolate and exclude our country in international affairs is becoming increasingly unpopular and bankrupt.
	All these victories can only be achieved in the new China after liberation, by following the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Conversely, if we do not accept the leadership of the Communist Party and follow the socialist road, we will absolutely not be able to obtain these victories. Therefore, we also recognize a truth, that is, the Great Leap Forward that has occurred in our country for more than a year is inseparable from the great victory achieved by the people of our country under the leadership of the Communist Party in the nationwide rectification campaign and anti-rightist struggle in the period from 1957 to 1958. The anti-rightist struggle and the nationwide rectification movement are a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. After this struggle, the confidence of the people of the whole country in moving forward to socialism has become more firm, and the bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals have also received a profound education in the struggle, thereby enabling them to have a certain degree of improvement in politics and ideology. Therefore, the great victory of this movement embodies that socialism has basically defeated capitalism on the political and ideological fronts in our country. This new political and ideological foundation is an important factor in promoting the accelerated progress of our socialist construction, and it is undoubtedly an indispensable important factor for our country to realize the Great Leap Forward in 1958. As Premier Zhou said in the Government Work Report, "Our socialist construction is carried out simultaneously with and promotes each other with the socialist revolution."

	The progress of the democratic parties is only the beginning of fundamental transformation, because this transformation is a complex, arduous, long-term, and repetitive process.
	The members of the democratic parties, including the leaders, have undergone a serious test and received a profound class education through the year and a half of the anti-rightist rectification movement. As far as the Zhi Gong Party is concerned, after the anti-rightist rectification, most members have a relatively clear understanding of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and taking the socialist road. Generally speaking, the political level has been improved, and most members have also taken a step to the left in their political stance, and there have also been some good manifestations of serving socialism. But this can only be said to be the beginning of the fundamental transformation of a bourgeois political party. We have initially realized that self-fundamental transformation is a complex, arduous, and long-term task, and there is also repetition in the process of transformation. We have already used the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao as the criteria for self-fundamental transformation, and formulated a transformation plan suitable for the actual situation to spur ourselves and work hard to transform ourselves, hoping that our members can gradually meet Chairman Mao's six criteria politically, and change the Zhi Gong Party from a bourgeois political party to a political party that truly accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and serves socialism. Only in this way can we adapt to the needs of socialist construction. Only in this way can we realize the glorious future of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the Communist Party.
	In the past four years, our country's achievements in various fields have been great, but we will never forget that our victories will always be vilified and undermined by the imperialists and their echoers who are bent on being enemies with us. We must be vigilant and smash their conspiracies and tricks at any time. From the time when the people's communes began to be established last year, our enemies have carried out all kinds of malicious rumors and slanders against them. But the rising sun of the people's communes has developed and consolidated day by day, which has become a well-known fact. Let the imperialists and their lackeys tremble and slander! The newborn just cause cannot be slandered or destroyed.

	Indian expansionist gentlemen who inherited the mantle of British imperialism, don't think that our country's greatest restraint in attaching importance to Sino-Indian friendship is weak and can be deceived. The era when China was at the mercy of others is gone forever.
	When the people of all ethnic groups across the country were advancing victoriously under the leadership of the Communist Party, the original Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique colluded with the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and foreign reactionaries to launch an armed rebellion on March 10 this year to betray the motherland, undermine the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity, and abducted the Dalai Lama to India. Our government has ordered the dissolution of the original Tibetan local government, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will exercise the functions and powers of the local government. During the period when the Dalai Lama was abducted, the Panchen Lama will act as the director of the Preparatory Committee, and the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will be responsible for completely suppressing the rebellion. Now, the Tibetan troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the support of the monks and lay people in Tibet, have completely crushed this reactionary armed rebellion in a very short period of time. This small handful of reactionary cliques has suffered a shameful defeat. I firmly support all the measures taken by our government for Tibet and the foreign policy mentioned by Premier Zhou in the Government Work Report. I am convinced that the monks and lay compatriots in Tibet will realize the democratic reform in Tibet earlier and carry out socialist construction after eradicating the small handful of reactionaries pressing on their heads this time. A new page is unfolding in the history of the Tibetan people, and the great unity of all ethnic groups in our country will be further consolidated. Tibet is a part of Chinese territory and has been for more than 700 years. The Tibetan people are one of the ethnic groups in the big family of all ethnic groups in China. Our country's action to quell the rebellion of a small handful of rebels in Tibet is entirely our country's internal affair, and no one has the right to interfere. These are all very clear. However, in our neighboring country India, some people have copied the tone of the imperialists and insisted that Tibetans are different from Chinese people. Some Indian politicians have also publicly expressed great "enthusiasm" for the rebellion of a few upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet, and even recently, Indian government officials distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." We firmly oppose these. Because any support for Tibetan traitors by any outsider is an interference in China's internal affairs, which we can never allow. We have always cherished the friendship between China and India and are willing to work to consolidate and develop this friendship. Therefore, we will never tolerate Indian expansionists undermining the long-standing friendly relations between the two countries and peoples of China and India. We will never allow Indian expansionists to interfere in our internal affairs. Indian expansionist gentlemen who inherited the mantle of British imperialism, don't think that our country's greatest restraint in attaching importance to Sino-Indian friendship is weak and can be deceived. Restraint is limited. The era when China was at the mercy of others is gone forever, and it is absolutely impossible for any outsider to try to interfere in China's internal affairs.

	We must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, follow the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. On the basis of the victory in 1958, we will continue to contribute all our strength to the completion and overfulfillment of the 1959 national economic plan centered on the four major indicators proposed by the Party: 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 1050 billion jin of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton, to fully realize a greater leap forward in 1959.

### 对西藏叛国分子的支持就是对我国内政的干预  陈其尤代表的发言

    对西藏叛国分子的支持就是对我国内政的干预
    陈其尤代表的发言主席，各位代表，各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来理所作的政府工作报告，李富春副总理所作的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理所作的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告，和李维汉副主席在中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议上所作的人民政协常务委员会工作报告。这些报告全面地总结了第一届人民代表大会第一次会议四年多以来，特别是一九五八年我国大跃进的成就和经验，并提出了一九五九年宏伟的任务，它们集中地表达了我国人民的共同意志和愿望，也鼓舞着我国人民为完成一九五九年更大跃进而贡献一切力量。
    从一九五四年第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议召开到现在只经过四年多的时间，我们的国家已发生了巨大的积极的变化。全国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，在社会主义革命方面和社会主义建设方面都获得了辉煌的成就，特别是一九五八年在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下在全国范围内工农业和各种建设的全面大跃进，实现了若干主要产品比一九五七年的生产量翻一番的史无前例的奇迹，迅速地改变了我国工农业生产的面貌，在农村中创造和普遍建立了适合我国目前情况和今后发展的工、农、商、学、兵相结合、政社合一的最好的社会组织形式——人民公社，更有力地推动着我国生产力继续向前发展，加速社会主义建设胜利前进。最近国家统计局发表的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划执行结果的公报”和“关于一九五八年国民经济发展情况的公报”两个文件，充分说明了这些事实。我国大跃进的一年不仅在我国历史上是空前的而且在人类历史上也写下了光辉灿烂的一页。回顾既往，瞻望将来，我们有百倍的信心，将在最短时间内赶上和超过英国。
    在国内各个战线上取得了伟大胜利的同时，在国际事务中，我国同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国在一起，同所有爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，对于保卫世界和平的事业，作出了巨大的努力，取得了光辉的成就。我国同苏联和其他社会主义国家的友好团结互助的兄弟关系，有了很大的发展；我国同亚洲和非洲的一系列新独立的国家的良好外交关系也在日益发展；同我国建立外交关系和经济文化关系的国家也日益增加；美帝国主义企图在国际事务中孤立排斥我国的政策，越来越不得人心和日益破产。
    所有这一切胜利，只有在解放后的新中国，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下走社会主义的道路才能实现。反之，如不接受共产党的领导和走社会主义的道路，我们是绝对得不到这些胜利的。因此，我们也认识了一个真理，即一年多来我们国家所出现的大跃进，是与一九五七年至一九五八年这个时期我国人民在共产党领导下，进行的全民整风和反右派斗争取得伟大的胜利分不开的。反右派斗争和全民整风运动是社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争；经过这一斗争，全国人民向社会主义快步前进的信心更加坚定了，资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子在斗争中也受到了一次深刻的教育，从而使他们在政治上和思想上有了一定程度的提高。因此，这个运动的伟大胜利体现出我国人民在政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义基本上战胜了资本主义。这种政治上和思想上的新基础是促进我国社会主义建设加速进行的重要因素，无疑的它也是我国实现一九五八年的大跃进所不能缺少的重要因素。正如周总理在政府工作报告中所说“我国的社会主义建设是跟社会主义革命同时进行和互相促进的”。
    民主党派的一些进步，只是根本改造的开始，因为这个改造是一个复杂、艰巨、长期而且会有反复的过程
    民主党派的成员，包括领导人在内，经过一年半的反右整风运动，都经受了一次严重的考验和受到了一次深刻的阶级教育。就致公党来说，经过反右派整风以后，多数成员对于接受共产党领导走社会主义道路比较有了明确的认识，一般说来政治水准有所提高，大多数成员在政治立场上也向左转化了一步，为社会主义服务的态度也有了一些好的表现。但是这只能说是一个资产阶级性政党的根本改造的开始。我们初步认识到自我根本改造是一个复杂、艰巨而长期的工作，在改造的过程中，还有反复性。我们已经以毛主席所指示出的六条政治标准作为自我根本改造的标准，制定出适合实际情况的改造规划，鞭策自己，努力改造，希望我们的成员能够逐步在政治上基本上符合于毛主席的六条标准，把致公党从一个资产阶级性的政党改变成为一个真正接受共产党领导为社会主义服务的政党。只有这样，我们才能适应社会主义建设的需要。只有这样，我们才能实现与共产党长期共存互相监督的光荣前途。
  四年多来，我国在各方面的成就是伟大的，但我们绝不会忘记，我们的胜利，总要遭到一心与我们为敌的帝国主义和它的应声虫们的诬蔑和破坏，我们必须提高警惕，随时粉碎它们的阴谋诡计。从去年人民公社开始建立的时候起，我们的敌人就对于它进行一切恶毒的造谣诬蔑。但是人民公社这个初升的太阳，一天一天的发展和巩固起来，已成为人所共见的事实了。让帝国主义和它的仆从们去发抖吧，诽谤吧！新生的正义的事业是诽谤不了，破坏不了的。
    继承英帝国主义衣钵的印度扩张主义先生们，你们不要以为我国以中印友好关系为重而表现的最大克制，是软弱可欺，中国任人欺侮的时代已经一去不复返了
    当全国各族人民在共产党的领导下胜利前进的时候，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮以及外国反动派在本年三月十日发动背叛祖国、破坏祖国统一和民族团结的武装叛乱，并将达赖喇嘛劫往印度。我们政府已经下令解散原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，在达赖喇嘛被劫持期间，筹备委员会主任一职由班禅喇嘛代理，并责成中国人民解放军西藏军区彻底平息叛乱。现在，中国人民解放军驻藏部队在西藏僧俗人民的支持下，在很短几天中，就彻底粉碎了这一反动武装叛乱。这一小撮反动集团是已经遭到了可耻的失败了。我坚决拥护我国政府对于西藏的一切措施，和周总理在政府工作报告中所说的对外政策。我深信西藏的僧俗同胞们在这次根除了压在他们头上的一小撮反动派之后，将更提早实现西藏地方的民主改革，和进行社会主义的建设。西藏人民的历史正在展开新的一页，我国各民族的大团结，将更进一步地得到巩固。西藏是中国领土的一部分，已有七百多年，西藏人民是中国各民族大家庭中的一个民族，我们国家平定西藏地方一小撮叛乱分子的行动，完全是我国的内政，任何人没有权利干涉，这些都是非常明白的事。但是，在我们的邻邦印度，竟有人抄袭帝国主义的口吻硬说西藏人与中国人不同，某些印度的政治家还公开对西藏少数上层反动分子的叛乱表示很大的“热心”，甚至在最近竟然由印度政府官员散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这些，都是我们坚决反对的。因为任何外人对西藏叛国分子的支持，都是对于中国内政的干预，是我们所决不能容许的。我们一贯珍重中印两国之间的友谊，并愿为巩固和发展这种友谊而努力，因此，我们绝不能容忍印度的扩张主义分子破坏中印两国和人民之间长期以来建立的友好关系，我们决不许印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政，继承英帝国主义衣钵的印度扩张主义先生们，你们不要以为我国以中印友好关系为重而表现出的最大克制是软弱可欺，克制是有限度的。中国任人家欺侮的时代是已经一去不复返了，任何外人妄想干预中国内政是绝对不行的。
    我们一定要在共产党的领导下，遵循着党的鼓足干劲力争上游多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，在一九五八年胜利的基础上继续为完成和超额完成党所提出的以钢一千八百万吨、煤三亿八千万吨、粮食一万零五百亿斤、棉花一亿担的四大指标为中心的一九五九年国民经济计划而贡献一切力量，全面实现一九五九年更大的跃进。
