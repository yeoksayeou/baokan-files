Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi – Vietnam's first modern knitting factory, the Dong Xuan Knitting Factory, was inaugurated on the 13th. This is one of the eighteen factories and mines that China helped Vietnam build in 1958 under the Sino-Vietnamese economic cooperation agreement. The factory has more than 200 automatic knitting machines and can manufacture elastic bands, waistbands, socks, underwear, and mosquito netting fabric. The output of its various products is sufficient to supply the needs of northern Vietnam for these products. Construction of the factory began in May of last year. In order to meet the needs of the people, the factory started production while still under construction from the fourth quarter of last year, and has already exceeded its production plan for the first quarter of this year, producing more than forty kinds of new products.

At the factory's inauguration ceremony today, Vietnamese Deputy Minister of Industry Vu Anh said that the completion of the Dong Xuan Knitting Factory has added a flower to the industrial garden of North Vietnam, and it is also a flower of "Vietnam-China friendship" blooming in this crucial year of Vietnam's Three-Year Plan (1958-1960).

    越南建成首座针织厂
    新华社河内讯　越南第一座现代化的针织厂——冬春针织厂于13日宣告落成。这是中国在1958年根据中越经济合作协定帮助越南建设的十八个厂矿中的一个。这座工厂拥有二百多台自动针织机，可以制造松紧带、腰带、袜子、卫生衣、蚊帐布。它的各种产品的产量足够供应越南北方对这些产品的需要。这座工厂在去年5月间开始建厂。为了适应人民的需要，从去年第四季度起，工厂边建设边生产，并且已经超额完成了今年第一季度的生产计划，生产了四十多种新产品。
    在今天举行的工厂落成仪式上，越南工业部副部长武英讲话说，冬春针织厂的落成，使北越工业园地增添了一朵花，这也是在越南的三年计划（1958—1960）带关键性的一年里开放的一朵“越中友谊”之花。
