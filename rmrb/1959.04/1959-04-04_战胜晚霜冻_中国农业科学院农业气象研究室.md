Overcoming Late Spring Frost
Agricultural Meteorology Research Office, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

This year's climate is warming up earlier than in previous years. The period of lowest temperatures occurred in early January, ten to fifteen days earlier than in previous years. Since late January, the weather has been unusually warm for fifteen days, and most areas south of the Yellow River basin have successively returned to spring. However, according to meteorological data analysis, it is estimated that the termination date of late spring frost in areas north of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and south of the Hai River basin this year will be slightly later than usual.

Due to the early warming this year, crops are developing ahead of schedule; however, the delayed end of frost will pose a greater threat to production. The later the stage of growth, the weaker the crop's resistance to cold. Even mild frosts can cause serious damage.

The harm of frost to crops is mainly due to the effect of low temperatures, which can cause crops to freeze to death, either partially or entirely. Throughout the years, the losses caused by frost to agricultural production have been very serious. For example, in mid-April 1953, a late frost caused frost damage to approximately 100 million mu of wheat in the Huanghuai area alone, resulting in losses of approximately 7 billion jin. All regions should pay close attention to late spring frost this year and make preparations for frost prevention in advance.

The harm of frost is serious, but it can be overcome. Late frosts are generally not very intense. As long as the temperature in the fields is artificially raised slightly when frost occurs, the harm of low temperatures to crops can be greatly reduced or even avoided.

In order to overcome frost, preparations must be made in advance. First of all, the right-leaning sentiments of some cadres and the masses who believe that frost cannot be overcome should be eliminated, and the belief that man can conquer nature should be established. Since the occurrence of frost this year may be later than in previous years, people may easily think that the frost period has passed and relax their vigilance. This point should also be emphasized in publicity. All regions can establish frost prevention organizations in advance, implement a system of special personnel responsible, level-by-level responsibility, and contract responsibility for different areas. At the same time, meteorological stations and outposts in various regions can be organized into frost intelligence groups to closely monitor the occurrence of frost. The Chinese people have accumulated a lot of frost prevention experience in production, and smoking, covering, and irrigation are relatively effective and applicable methods.

The smoking method has been widely adopted in various parts of China. Its function is mainly direct heating and the heat preservation effect of the smoke screen. This method has many creations and improvements in application, forming various styles, such as ground straw smoking, small kiln smoking, frost prevention trenches, frost prevention pits, and frost prevention carts. It can be widely used in areas with sufficient fuel.

Smoking should start one or two hours before frost and stop after sunrise the next day, and there should be no open flames. This will not only achieve good results but also save fuel.

The covering method is reliable and suitable for the seedling stage of crops. Its function is mainly to prevent the ground from cooling rapidly. Covering materials can be obtained locally. Rice straw, wheat straw, mats, oil paper, etc. can be used, and wheat bran, plant ash, and livestock manure can also be used. Cover well before frost and remove after frost.

The irrigation method is also widely used at present and can be used in areas with sufficient water sources. The function of irrigation is mainly because the water temperature is high, which raises the temperature and humidity of the soil and near-surface air after irrigation, weakening the cooling effect. The effect of irrigation can last for several days, and the closer the irrigation date is to the arrival of frost, the better the effect.

In addition, timely sowing, reasonable fertilization, and strengthening field management can all reduce the damage of frost.

Some areas use ropes to pull off frost and sweep off frost after frost, which does not raise the temperature and is prone to causing mechanical damage to crops, aggravating the degree of damage. This method should not be used.

If frost has already caused damage, in less severe cases, it can be restored as long as timely fertilization and irrigation are carried out and management is strengthened; especially since wheat has a strong tillering ability, a certain harvest can still be obtained after recovery. Since conditions vary from place to place and crop types vary, the methods should also be applied differently according to the time, place, and specific crop to achieve good results.

    战胜晚霜冻
    中国农业科学院农业气象研究室
    今年的气候比往年暖得早。温度最低的时期出现在1月上旬，较往年提早十天至十五天。1月下旬以来，十五天气异常温暖，黄河流域以南大部分地区已先后回春。但根据气象资料分析，估计今年长江中下游以北、海河流域以南各地区，春季晚霜冻的终止日期将比常年略迟。
    由于今年回暖早，作物生育提前；而霜冻延迟结束，这将给生产带来较大的威胁。愈到生育后期，作物抗寒能力愈弱，不强的霜冻也能造成严重危害。
    霜冻对作物的危害主要是由于低温的作用，使作物部分乃至全部冻死。历年来由于霜冻给农业生产造成的损失是十分严重的。例如1953年4月中旬一次晚霜冻，使黄淮地区仅小麦就约有一亿亩遭受冻害，损失达七十亿斤左右。各地应密切重视今年晚霜冻，事先作好防霜准备。
    霜冻的危害是严重的，但也是能够战胜的。后期晚霜冻一般强度都不太大，只要在霜冻来临时，用人工方法稍微提高田间的温度，就可以大大减弱以至避免低温对农作物的危害。
    为了战胜霜冻，要事先作好准备工作。首先应消除部分干部和群众认为霜冻无法战胜的右倾情绪，树立起人定胜天的信念。由于今年的霜冻出现可能比往年迟，人们很容易认为霜冻期已过而放松警惕，这一点也应注意宣传。各地可以在事先建立起防霜冻组织，实行专人负责，层层负责，分片包干的办法。同时可将各地的气象站、哨等组成霜冻情报组，严密地监视霜冻的发生。我国人民在生产中已经积累了不少防霜经验，比较有效和适用的有熏烟、复盖和灌溉等方法。
    熏烟法在我国各地已广泛采用，它的作用主要是直接增温和烟幕的保温作用。这种方法在应用中有了很多创造和改进，形成了各种样式，如地面堆草熏烟、小土窑熏烟、防霜壕、防霜坑、防霜车等。在燃料充足地区可以广泛采用。
    熏烟时间要在霜冻前一、二小时开始，次日日出后再停止，并且不要发生明火。这样既能得到良好效果，又能节省燃料。
    复盖法效果可靠，在作物苗期比较合适，它的作用主要是防止地面急剧冷却。复盖物可就地取材，稻草、麦秸、席子、油纸等都可以，麦糠、草木灰、牲畜粪等也都能利用。霜冻前盖好，霜后撤回。
    灌溉法目前应用也很广，水源充足地区可以采用。灌溉的作用主要是由于水温高，灌后提高了土壤和近地面空气的温度和湿度，削弱了降温作用。灌水的效果可延续数日，灌水日期离霜冻来临愈近效果愈好。
    此外适时播种，合理施肥加强田间管理都能够减轻霜冻的为害。
    有些地区在霜后用绳子拉霜和扫霜，这并不能使气温提高，反容易对作物造成机械损伤，加重了受害程度。这种办法不宜采用。
    如果霜冻已经为害，在不太严重的情况下，只要及时施肥灌水加强管理，是可以恢复的；尤其是小麦分蘖力很强，恢复以后还能获得一定的收成。由于各地条件不同，作物种类不同，在方法上，也要因时、因地，按作物分别对象来应用，才能获得良好效果。
