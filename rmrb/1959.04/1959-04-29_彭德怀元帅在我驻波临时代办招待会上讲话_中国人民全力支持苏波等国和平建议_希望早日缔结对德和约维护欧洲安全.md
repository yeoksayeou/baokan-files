Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 27th: Yao Guang, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of our embassy in Poland, held a reception tonight for the Chinese military friendship delegation headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai, which is visiting Poland.

Among those invited to the reception were Polish party and state leaders Cyrankiewicz, Jendrychowski, Ochab, Rapacki, Spychalski, and other responsible comrades of the Polish government, as well as senior generals of the Polish army, totaling more than two hundred people.

Foreign ministers of various countries attending the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the China Foreign Ministers' Meeting were also invited to attend the reception. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Poland also attended the reception.

Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Yao Guang delivered a speech at the meeting first. Subsequently, Marshal Peng Dehuai spoke at the meeting.

Peng Dehuai first expressed his gratitude to the Polish people and the Polish People's Army for the warm hospitality and enthusiastic welcome the Chinese military friendship delegation received during its visit to Poland. He then said that we came with the friendship of the Chinese people and army, and we will leave full of the friendship of the Polish people and army. We are pleased to see that the hard-working Polish people are diligently engaged in peaceful labor on the beautiful and rich land of their motherland. The new socialist Poland has been built on the ruins of war. Our close comrades-in-arms, the Polish People's Army, under the leadership and care of the United Workers' Party, has become even stronger. It has become a strong people's army, and it stands firmly with the powerful Soviet army and the armies of socialist countries, vigilantly defending the security of the motherland and safeguarding European and world peace.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that we are in an era of vigorous development of socialism and the decaying death of capitalism. No force in the world can stop the victorious advance of peace and the cause of human progress. If the Western imperialist bloc dares to risk launching a war, it will eat its own bitter fruit and suffer a complete defeat.

Peng Dehuai emphasized that the Chinese government and people fully support the reasonable proposals and major efforts made by the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries regarding the peaceful resolution of the German question, safeguarding European collective security, and easing international tensions. We hope for the early conclusion of a German peace treaty and the early victory of the cause of peaceful reunification of Germany. We believe that the reactionary ruling clique of West Germany's clamoring for non-recognition of the existing peaceful border between Poland and Germany exposes their malicious territorial ambitions towards Poland. We fully support the just struggle of the Polish people to defend the security of their motherland. The more than 600 million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will always be with the Polish people and army, with the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and with the world's peace and democracy forces, fighting against imperialist aggression and safeguarding lasting world peace.

Polish Minister of National Defense Spychalski also spoke at the meeting. He said that in order to realize our country's socialist construction tasks and ensure the welfare of our people's lives, we need lasting peace. Historical experience tells us that we need strong and good friends. Now we know that we are not isolated, and with us are all the socialist countries from the shores of the Pacific to the Elbe River—the great socialist camp, and with us are the advanced and powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. He also said that historical experience tells us that imperialism cannot be trusted, because imperialism means war. The suffering that the people endured during the fascist era keeps them vigilant. Therefore, our government's plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe and all the Soviet Union's peace initiatives are understandable. He said that the peaceful aspirations of our camp and the measures taken to consolidate peace are reflected in the current meeting of foreign ministers of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and China.

    彭德怀元帅在我驻波临时代办招待会上讲话
    中国人民全力支持苏波等国和平建议
    希望早日缔结对德和约维护欧洲安全
    新华社华沙27日电　我国驻波兰大使馆临时代办姚广今晚为以彭德怀元帅为首的中国军事友好代表团访问波兰举行招待会。
    应邀出席招待会的有波兰党和国家领导人西伦凯维兹、英德里霍夫斯基、奥哈布、腊帕茨基、斯彼哈尔斯基，以及波兰政府的其他负责同志、波兰军队高级将领等二百多人。
    出席华沙条约缔约国和中国外长会议的各国外长也应邀参加了招待会。出席招待会的还有各国驻波兰外交使节。
    姚广临时代办在会上首先致词。随后，彭德怀元帅在会上讲了话。
    彭德怀首先对中国军事友好代表团在波兰参观访问期间所受到的盛情招待和热情欢迎向波兰人民和波兰人民军表示感谢。他接着说，我们带着中国人民和军队的友情而来，又将满载波兰人民和军队的友情而去。我们高兴地看到勤劳的波兰人民在美丽富饶的祖国土地上辛勤地进行着和平的劳动。社会主义的新波兰已经在战争的废墟上建设起来了。我们亲密的战友波兰人民军在统一工人党的领导和关怀下，已经更为坚强了。它已经成为一支坚强的人民军队，并且同强大的苏联军队，同社会主义国家的军队牢固地站在一起，警惕地保卫着祖国的安全，保卫着欧洲和世界和平。
    彭德怀元帅说，我们正处在社会主义蓬勃发展，资本主义腐朽死亡的时代。世界上没有什么力量能够阻止和平和人类进步事业的胜利前进。如果西方帝国主义集团胆敢冒险发动战争，它将自食其果，遭到彻底的失败。
    彭德怀强调说，中国政府和人民全力支持苏联、波兰等国关于和平解决德国问题、维护欧洲集体安全和缓和国际紧张局势所提出的合理建议和所作的重大努力。我们希望早日缔结对德和约，希望德国的和平统一事业早日胜利。我们认为，西德反动统治集团不承认波德之间现存和平边境的叫嚣，暴露了他们对波兰抱有恶毒的领土野心。我们全力支持波兰人民为保卫祖国安全所进行的正义斗争。六亿多中国人民和中国人民解放军将永远地同波兰人民和军队在一起，同以苏联为首的社会主义各国在一起，同世界和平民主力量在一起，为反对帝国主义侵略，保卫世界持久和平而奋斗。
    波兰国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基也在会上讲了话。他说，为了实现我国社会主义的建设任务，保证我国人民的生活福利，我们需要持久的和平。历史经验告诉我们，我们需要强大的好朋友。现在我们知道，我们并不是孤立的，和我们在一起的有从太平洋岸到易北河的所有社会主义国家——伟大的社会主义阵营，和我们在一起的有世界上先进的、强大的社会主义国家苏联和中华人民共和国。他又说，历史经验告诉我们，不能相信帝国主义，因为帝国主义就是战争。人民在法西斯主义时代所受的痛苦使他们保持着警惕，因此，我国政府关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的计划和苏联的所有的和平倡议，都是可以理解的。他说，我们阵营的和平愿望和为巩固和平所采取的措施表现在在目前华沙条约缔约国和中国的外长会议上。
