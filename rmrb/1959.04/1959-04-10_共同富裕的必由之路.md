    The Inevitable Road to Common Prosperity
    The Principle of Distribution According to Labor Must Be Upheld

    The mode of distribution, in the final analysis, depends on the mode of social production and the ownership of the means of production. What kind of mode of production there is, there is what kind of mode of distribution, and this is not transferred by people's will.

    Although the mode of distribution depends on the mode of production, every outdated mode of distribution disappears with the elimination of the outdated mode of production, and the new mode of distribution arises with the emergence of the new mode of production, but once the new mode of distribution is produced, it does not merely play a passive role of adaptation to the mode of production. On the contrary, it plays an active role in promoting and improving the productive forces and consolidating and developing the relations of production. The mode of production and the mode of distribution are a unity of opposites, which are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. Therefore, in determining the mode of distribution, it must be based on the nature of the mode of production, and it must take into account the level of development of the productive forces and the degree of consciousness of the masses. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people be fully mobilized, which is conducive to the development of production and the consolidation and improvement of the people's communes.

      "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work" is the socialist principle of distribution, which has unparalleled superiority compared with the capitalist system of not working and gaining, working without gain, and more work and less gain. Under the socialist system, the working people not only jointly own the means of production and the products of labor, but also jointly enjoy the equal right and equal obligation of labor, and jointly enjoy the fruits of labor according to the quantity and quality of labor, more work more gain, less work less gain, and no work no gain. This principle of distribution is in line with the requirements of socialist construction, and it is also in line with the interests of the broad masses of working people. It is fair and reasonable under the historical conditions of our country at the present stage.

    To recognize the principle of distribution according to work is essentially to recognize differences. Due to the different production bases and different levels of economic development, some production bases are good and the level of economic development is high; some production bases are poor and the level of economic development is low. Therefore, there are differences in the degree of prosperity between communes and communes, management areas and management areas, and production teams and production teams. Due to different business management, some business management is good, and some business management is not good, so the income of each commune, management area, and production team also has certain differences. Due to the difference in people's physical strength, technology and labor, some are strong, some are weak, some have more production experience and high technical level, some have less production experience and low technical level, some have good labor attitude, some have bad labor attitude, some are engaged in complex labor, some are engaged in simple labor, some are engaged in mental labor, some are engaged in physical labor, and each person's contribution to the society is different, so each person's income should also have many differences. These differences are objective and must be recognized. At the same time, it must be pointed out that the nature of these differences is fundamentally different from the differences between the exploiting class and the exploited class, and does not carry the brand of class exploitation and the difference between the rich and the poor caused by the internal class differentiation of peasants before agricultural cooperation. This is the difference caused by different production bases and levels of economic development, the difference between advanced and backward in business management, and the difference shown by the people internally in labor. Precisely because of the differences in the above objective and subjective conditions, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of distribution according to work in the handling of the distribution problem in 1958 and the formulation of the distribution plan in 1959, correctly formulate relevant economic policies according to the requirements of this principle, and correctly implement these policies.

    Today we recognize differences and implement the principle of distribution according to work precisely to create conditions for the future, eliminate differences, and implement the principle of distribution according to need. Marxism believes that recognizing differences and eliminating differences are opposed and unified, which is the dialectic of the development of things. Some differences can be eliminated, and some differences will always exist even in communist society, at most they can only be reduced to the minimum. For those that can be eliminated, it is necessary to actively create conditions to gradually eliminate them. If the objective conditions are ripe, it is wrong not to actively eliminate them. If the objective conditions are not yet ripe, it is also wrong to artificially eliminate them with subjective wishes alone.

    At present, there are various views on this issue. In the final analysis, there are only two kinds. Some people believe that to eliminate differences, we should adhere to the principle of more pay for more work in the people's commune, vigorously develop production, and in the process of production development, make the rich society richer and make the less rich society quickly catch up with and surpass the rich society. Only in this way can the differences between various communes, management areas, production teams, and the differences in the income of the members caused by these differences gradually tend to be balanced. Undoubtedly, this view is correct. If it is considered that it is not necessary to have any process to eliminate this difference, and therefore an attempt is made to adopt the method of leveling distribution is obviously wrong. The reason why it is wrong is that they have left the high development of production and adopted a simple method. The result of doing so will inevitably be contrary to expectations.

            How to Become Rich
    Poverty and wealth are two opposite sides of unity. Chairman Mao said: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change." Change is transformation, that is, making poverty transform into wealth and move towards the opposite. Here, it is first necessary to distinguish between two different kinds of poverty and wealth. Before liberation, poverty was the poverty of the exploited class, the poverty of the majority; wealth was the wealth of the exploiting class, the wealth of a few. After liberation, the situation is fundamentally different. The means of production have been grasped by the working people and become collective and all-people ownership. The class roots of the opposition between poverty and wealth have been eliminated; but the problem of transforming from poverty to wealth has not been completely solved. This is because: First, China is a large country with a large population, but the original economic foundation is extremely weak and production is backward. Although there was a great leap forward last year, producing 11 million tons of steel, 750 billion catties of grain, and 67 million dan of cotton, this is an amazing achievement; but on a per capita basis, the production quantity is still not large, and the level of economic development is not high enough. Second, in the development of production, some units have developed rapidly and have quickly gotten rid of the poverty left over from the old society, while some units have developed slowly and have not completely changed their original appearance. It can be seen that the difference between poverty and wealth still exists. We must recognize that this difference between poverty and wealth is essentially different from the disparity between poverty and wealth before liberation. After liberation, compared with before liberation, our country's production and people's lives have been greatly improved through land reform, the cooperation movement, the people's commune movement, and the great leap forward in production, but the level of improvement is still different.

    Different methods should be adopted to solve contradictions of different natures. The contradiction between poverty and wealth in the old society was antagonistic, and we adopted the method of armed struggle and changing the social system to solve it. This revolution has been victorious.

    After liberation, the road from poverty to wealth is the road of organization, the road of cooperation, the road of people's communes, and the road of the Great Leap Forward, which is the road of taking socialism now and communism later. This is the inevitable road from poverty to wealth. Practice has proved that this wealth is wealth for everyone, is the road to common prosperity, not the road to the prosperity of a few.

    On the road of socialism, there are still differences between various production units. Differences are contradictions, but this contradiction is not antagonistic. The principle of resolving this difference, from the perspective of those poor units, should be based on self-reliance, fully utilizing internal potential, supplemented by state support, and rapidly improving production to catch up with rich units. From the leadership's perspective, poor units should be given as much attention and help as possible. Helping poor units catch up with rich units is in line with the leadership method of grasping both ends. Grasping both ends means using the advanced to drive the middle, while helping the backward to catch up with the advanced, so as to promote production forward. This leadership method is a good method that conforms to the objective laws of development. It is entirely necessary for us to help the poor catch up with the rich by various methods, especially in terms of cadres, materials, and technology. In this way, the poor will become rich, and the rich will become richer, and the face of our countryside will change faster.

    Is there a way to make the poor become rich quickly? There are the following ways.

    First, strengthen political and ideological work. The key is to first strengthen the leadership of the Party and strengthen political and ideological work. As some comrades have said, of all the lines, political and ideological work is the first line. This is originally needed to do any work well. Some masses in poor units may have special ideological problems, such as thinking that the foundation is weak, and having a dependent mentality, etc. We must work on these specific thoughts. We must educate them to make up their minds, set great ambitions, and catch up with rich units in a relatively short period of time. As long as there is ambition and determination, the situation can be changed quickly. The "poor stick" cooperative of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, cited by Chairman Mao can serve as proof, and countless similar communes in our Anhui Province can also serve as proof. As long as we do a thorough job of ideological work and give full play to the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses, it is not only possible to turn over economically, but the time will not be very long. Not only can a poor commune quickly become a rich commune, but a poor county can also quickly become a rich county.

    Second, transform nature. The reason why some areas and production units are poor is often due to many disasters and poor soil quality, among other reasons. These areas must eradicate the roots of poverty. The social roots of poverty have been resolved, but the natural roots have not been fundamentally resolved. Therefore, we must fight against nature and must vigorously build water conservancy projects and improve the soil. After water conservancy is built and the soil is improved, water disasters can be transformed into water conservancy, bad land can be transformed into good fields, no harvest can be transformed into more harvest, and low yield can be transformed into high yield. In short, as a result of the struggle against contradictions, unfavorable conditions will inevitably be transformed into favorable conditions, so that poverty is transformed into wealth.

    Third, technological reform. To transform nature quickly and well, and to achieve the goal of spending less labor and producing more efficiently, it is necessary to carry out technological reforms and improve labor efficiency.

    In addition to the above methods, those poorer units should also plant more high-yield economic crops, develop diversified economies, and carry out sideline production according to the unified plan of the state and the specific conditions of the unit, so as to make economic strength grow faster.

    It is of great significance for us to use a very fast speed to turn poor units into rich units. This is an important struggle, a great struggle to transform the objective world, and also a great struggle to transform the subjective world. This is not only a problem for these units themselves, but also a problem related to the overall situation.

### 共同富裕的必由之路

    共同富裕的必由之路
    要坚持按劳分配的原则
    分配方式，归根结底，取决于社会生产方式，取决于生产资料的所有制。有什么样的生产方式，就有什么样的分配方式，这是不以人们的意志为转移的。
    分配方式虽然取决于生产方式，每一种过时的分配方式，都随着过时的生产方式的消灭而消灭，新的分配方式，又随着新的生产方式的产生而产生，但是新的分配方式一旦产生，对于生产方式决不只是起消极的适应作用，相反，它对生产力的促进和提高，生产关系的巩固和发展都起着积极的推动作用。生产方式和分配方式是对立面的统一，是互相联系互相促进的，所以在确定分配方式时，就必须依据于生产方式的性质，就必须考虑到生产力发展的水平和人民群众的觉悟程度。只有如此，才能充分调动广大劳动群众的积极性，才有利于生产的发展以及人民公社的巩固和提高。
      “各尽所能，按劳分配”是社会主义的分配原则，它与资本主义的不劳而获，劳而不获，多劳少获比较起来，具有无比的优越性。在社会主义制度下，劳动人民不仅共同占有生产资料和劳动产品，并且也共同享有劳动的平等权利和平等义务，共同依据劳动的数量和质量，享有劳动成果，多劳多得，少劳少得，不劳不得。这种分配原则，是符合于社会主义建设要求的，也是符合于广大劳动人民的利益的，它在我国现阶段的历史条件下，是公平的、合理的。
    承认按劳分配原则，实质上就是要承认差别。由于生产基础的不同，经济发展的水平不同，有的生产基础好，经济发展水平高；有的生产基础差，经济发展水平低。所以公社和公社之间，管理区和管理区之间，生产队和生产队之间，就有富裕程度上的差别。由于经营管理的不同，有的经营管理得好，有的经营管理得不好，所以各个公社、管理区和生产队的收入，也就有着一定的差别。由于人们的体力、技术和劳动的不同，有的体力强，有的体力弱，有的生产经验多，技术水平高，有的生产经验少，技术水平低，有的劳动态度好，有的劳动态度不好，有的从事复杂劳动，有的从事简单劳动，有的从事脑力劳动，有的从事体力劳动，各个人对社会的贡献不同，所以各个人的收入，也就应该有多少的差别。这些差别是客观存在的，必须承认它。同时也必须指出，这些差别的性质根本不同于剥削阶级与被剥削阶级之间的差别，根本不带有阶级剥削和农业合作化之前由于农民内部阶级分化而引起的贫富差别的烙印。这是生产基础、经济发展水平不同所引起的差别，这是经营管理上先进与落后的差别，这是人民内部在劳动上所表现出来的差别。正由于有上述各方面的客观条件和主观条件的差别，因此在对1958年分配问题的处理，1959年分配计划的制定，都必须坚决贯彻按劳分配的原则，根据这个原则的要求，正确地制定有关的经济政策，并正确地执行这些政策。
    今天我们承认差别，实行按劳分配的原则，正是为将来创造条件，消灭差别，实行按需分配的原则。马克思主义认为，承认差别和消灭差别是对立的又是统一的，这是事物发展的辩证法。有的差别是能够消灭的，有的差别即使到了共产主义社会也会永远存在，至多只能够把它缩小到最小限度。对于能够消灭的，就必须积极地创造条件，逐步地消灭它。如果客观条件已经成熟，不积极地去消灭它是错误的。如果客观条件还不成熟，单凭主观愿望，人为地去消灭它也是错误的。
    目前，对于这个问题的认识，存在着各式各样的看法，归根结底，不外两种。一种人认为，要消灭差别，就应该在人民公社中，坚持按劳分配多劳多得的原则，就应该大力发展生产，在生产发展的过程中，使富裕的社更加富裕，使不太富裕的社迅速地赶上并超过富裕的社。只有这样，才能使各个公社之间、管理区之间、生产队之间的差别，以及由这些差别而引起的社员收入多少的差别，逐渐趋于平衡。无疑的这种看法是正确的。如果认为消灭这种差别，无须乎要什么过程，因而企图采取拉平分配的办法显然是错误的。其所以错误，就在于他们离开了生产的高度发展，采取了简单的办法。这样做的结果，必然是事与愿违。
      （摘自山西“前进”第四期社论：“按劳分配、承认差别”）
            如　何　变　富
    穷与富，是统一性的两个对立面。毛主席说：“穷则思变”。变就是转化，就是使穷转化为富、走向反面。在这里，首先要区别两种不同性质的穷与富。在解放以前，穷是被剥削阶级的穷，是多数人穷；富是剥削阶级的富，少数人富。解放后，情况根本不同了。生产资料已经掌握在劳动人民手里，成为集体和全民所有。穷富对立的阶级根源已经消灭了；但由穷变富的问题还没有完全解决。这是因为：第一，中国是一个大国，人口众多，原来经济基础却极为薄弱，生产落后，虽然去年大跃进，生产了一千一百万吨钢，七千五百亿斤粮食，六千七百万担棉花，这是惊人的成就；但按人口平均，生产数量还不大，经济发展水平还不够高。第二，在生产的发展中，有些单位生产发展得快，摆脱旧社会遗留下来的贫困状态也快，有些单位生产发展得慢，还没有完全改变原来面貌。可见穷富差别还是存在的。我们必须认识，这种穷富差别，与解放前的穷富悬殊是有本质区别的。解放以后，经过土地改革、合作化运动、人民公社化运动和生产大跃进，我国的生产和人民的生活与解放前比较，已有很大提高和改善，只是提高和改善的水平还有所不同。
    对不同性质的矛盾，要采取不同方法去解决，旧社会的穷富矛盾，是对抗性的，我们采取了武装斗争、变革社会制度的方法来解决。这种革命，已经取得胜利了。
    在解放以后，由穷变富的道路，是组织起来的道路，是合作化的道路，是人民公社化的道路，是大跃进的道路，也就是现在走社会主义、以后走共产主义的道路。这是由穷变富的必由之路。实践证明，这种富是所有人都富，是共同富裕的道路，不是少数人富裕的道路。
    在社会主义的道路上，各生产单位之间，还存在差别，差别就是矛盾，但这种矛盾不是对抗性的。解决这种差别的原则，从那些穷的单位来说，应以自力更生为主，充分发挥内在潜力，加上国家的支援为辅，迅速地把生产搞好，赶上富的单位，从领导上来说，对于穷的单位，应尽可能予以关照和帮助。帮助穷的单位，赶上富的单位，这是符合抓两头的领导方法的。抓两头，就是用先进来带动中间，同时帮助落后赶上先进，这样来推动生产向前发展，这种领导方法是合乎客观发展规律的好方法。我们用各种方法，特别是要从干部、物质和技术等方面来帮助穷的赶上富的，是完全必要的。这样穷的变富，富的更富，我们农村的面貌，就会更快地改变过来。
    有没有办法，使穷很快变富呢？有以下几种办法。
    一，加强政治思想工作。关键首先要加强党的领导，加强政治思想工作。正如有些同志所说，千条万条线，政治思想工作是第一条线。这本来是做好任何工作都需要的。穷的单位，有些群众可能有特殊思想问题，如认为底子薄，有依赖思想等等。我们要针对这些具体思想进行工作。要教育他们下决心，立大志，在较短的时间赶上富的单位。只要有志气、有决心，局面很快就能够改变。毛主席所举的河北省遵化县的“穷棒子”合作社可作证明，我们安徽省有无数类似的公社也可作证明。我们只要思想工作做得深透，充分发挥群众的干劲和智慧，在经济上翻身不但可能，而且时间也不会很长。不仅一个穷的公社可以很快变为富的公社，一个穷的县也可以很快变为富的县。
    第二，改造自然。有些地区和生产单位之所以穷，除其他原因外，往往由于多灾和土质不好。这些地区，要挖掉穷根，穷的社会根源已经解决，自然根源还没有根本解决，因此必须与自然作斗争，必须用大力兴修水利和改良土壤。水利兴修起来，土壤改良以后，水患就可以变为水利，坏地可以变为良田，不收变为多收，低产可以变为高产，总之，矛盾斗争的结果，不利条件必然向有利条件转化，这样穷就转化为富。
    第三，技术改革。改造自然要改造得快改造得好，要达到花劳动力少、生产效果高，就必须进行技术改革，提高劳动效率。
    除以上办法以外，那些较穷的单位，还应根据国家的统一计划和本单位的具体条件，多种一些高产、经济作物，发展多种经济和开展副业生产，使经济力量更快的增长。
    我们要用很快的速度来使穷的单位变为富的单位，这有很重要的意义。这是一场重要的斗争，是改造客观世界的伟大斗争，也是改造主观世界的伟大斗争。这不仅是这些单位本身的问题，而且是关系到全局的问题。
