New Achievements in Liangyu Well Construction Technology
"One-Time Well Completion" Speed Increased by 32%
The employees of the Liangyu Shaft of the Hebi Coal Mine in Henan Province created the "one-time well completion" method of well construction during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, opening up a new path for mine construction in our country.

In the past, vertical shaft wellbore construction was done by equipping (installing tank beams and tank lanes) the wellbore after the wellbore was sunk to the bottom. "One-time well completion" changes this practice; the lower section is excavated in the wellbore, and the upper section is lined. As soon as a section is lined, it is immediately installed. In this way, excavation, lining, and installation are carried out in parallel and crosswise, so that the wellbore is completed at one time, which can greatly speed up the construction. After the Liangyu Shaft used the "one-time well completion" method, it created a new record of 97.33 meters per month, and the average speed of the entire shaft was 32% higher than the average speed stipulated by the state.

While implementing "one-time well completion," they also creatively utilized permanent equipment, permanent headframes, permanent hoists, and related permanent building construction, which greatly simplified the layout of the ground and wellbore and saved about one-third of the wellbore construction equipment. Thus, this new method of well construction has been further improved and enhanced.

Using this new method of well construction, the Liangyu Mine has saved the state 180,000 yuan in investment and shortened the entire well construction period by three and a half months in the past year.

    梁峪建井技术上的新成就
    “一次成井”速度提高32％
    河南省鹤壁煤矿梁峪竖井职工在1958年大跃进当中，创造了“一次成井”的建井方法，为我国矿井建设开辟了一条新的道路。
    过去竖井井筒建设都是在井筒做到底以后才装备（安装罐梁罐道）。“一次成井”就是改变这种做法，在井筒中，下段掘进，上段砌井，砌完一段，立即安装。这样掘进、砌井、安装平行交叉作业，使井筒一次建成，可以大大加快施工速度。梁峪竖井运用“一次成井”的方法后，曾创造月进九十七点三三公尺的新纪录，全井平均速度比国家规定的平均速度高32％。
    在实行“一次成井”的同时，他们还创造性地利用了永久设备、永久井架、永久绞车和有关永久建筑物施工，使地面和井筒布置大大简化，节省井筒施工设备三分之一左右，因而把这种建井新方法更加完善和提高了一大步。
    梁峪矿采用这种新方法建井，一年来，为国家节省了十八万元投资，并缩短整个建井工期三个半月。
