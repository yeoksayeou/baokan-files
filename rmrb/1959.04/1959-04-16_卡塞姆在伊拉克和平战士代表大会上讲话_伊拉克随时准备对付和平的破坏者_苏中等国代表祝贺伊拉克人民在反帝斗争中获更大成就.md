Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 14th: Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem said at the Second Peace Partisans Congress held here today that Iraq "is a neutral and peaceful country, and it will not launch aggression against any country. But if anyone challenges us and launches aggression against us, we will stop him and defeat his attempt."

Prime Minister Kassem welcomed the guests from all over the world who came to attend the congress. He said, "They all have the noble aspiration to resist aggression and win peace."

Prime Minister Kassem said that Iraq is going through a difficult stage, but the power of the people is very strong, and they are confident that they can overcome any difficulties and obstacles. "We must be patient and firmly believe that we can achieve even greater achievements than we have now."

Prime Minister Kassem expressed his belief that peace will always triumph. He said, "Aggression will never succeed; it will eventually be crushed. Whether it is collective or individual aggression, it is bound to be crushed." Prime Minister Kassem said that he himself will always fight for peace. He also said that Iraq has prepared its military forces to deal with those who undermine peace.

Prime Minister Kassem told the peace partisans of Iraq, "Some conspiratorial splitters have infiltrated your ranks in order to sow discord and undermine the democratic spirit in your midst. Therefore, beware of them, because we do not want this democratic spirit to be undermined in this country after it has escaped humiliation and the status of no rights, and after it has gained freedom."

Prime Minister Kassem reiterated that he does not belong to any tendencies or trends, nor to any political parties. He said that he is working for the welfare of all the people and serving them.

He added, "I support and sympathize with all political parties, as long as their purpose is to serve the motherland, to serve freedom and peace. Nothing can separate me from them, whether it is religion, language, or ethnicity. We are marching hand in hand in the ranks of freedom and peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 14th: Aziz Sharif, Secretary-General of the Iraqi National Committee of Peace Partisans, said in his opening speech at the Second Iraqi Peace Partisans Congress this morning that the purpose of holding this congress is: "First, to continue to mobilize domestic and international public opinion in order to fight against activities that threaten and aggress against our republic; second, to work with the world peace movement to continue to strive for the settlement of various issues related to world peace, and to prepare for the Stockholm Peace Conference to be held on the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the World Peace Council."

Aziz Sharif pointed out that the Iraqi peace partisans participated in the ranks of the people's liberation struggle under the old regime. Many of them gave their lives, or suffered imprisonment, torture, exile, and deprivation of nationality.

He said that the Iraqi and Arab people will never forget the strong support of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries for the Republic of Iraq, and will not forget the demonstrations held by 300 million Chinese people to support the Iraqi revolution.

Aziz Sharif continued, the Shawwaf rebellion was quickly defeated because "the forces of peace and freedom are with us. The powerful peace camp is with us, and its powerful strength is invincible to imperialism and the forces of war."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 15th: The Second Iraqi Peace Partisans Congress held its first day of meetings on the 14th in a warm atmosphere.

Foreign delegations invited to attend the congress delivered congratulatory speeches at the congress.

Soviet representative Zadakh paid tribute to the victories achieved by the Iraqi people in their struggle for peace, freedom, and national independence in his speech. He assured that the Soviet Union supports the Arab countries. He said: "The friendship of the Soviet Union is reliable, and it never forgets its responsibility to its friends who oppose imperialism and strive for national independence." At the end of his speech, he read out the congratulatory message from the Soviet Committee for the Defense of World Peace to the Congress.

Chinese representative Burhan pointed out that the struggle for national independence is part of the struggle for peace. The Iraqi people have made great contributions to world peace. He wished the Iraqi peace partisans greater achievements in opposing imperialism and defending the republic and world peace.

Representatives from the World Peace Council, Iran, Lebanon, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania also spoke at the meeting. They all congratulated the congress and expressed their full support for the Iraqi peace movement.

    苏中等国代表祝贺伊拉克人民在反帝斗争中获更大成就
    新华社巴格达14日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆今天在这里举行的第二次和平战士代表大会上说，伊拉克“是中立的、和平的国家，它不会对任何国家发动侵略。但是如果有谁向我们挑战和对我们发动侵略的话，我们将制止他并且击败他这种企图。”
    卡塞姆总理对从世界各地来参加这次代表大会的来宾表示欢迎。他说，“他们都有反抗侵略和争取和平胜利的高尚愿望。”
    卡塞姆总理说，伊拉克正在经历着可能是困难的阶段，但是目前人民的力量非常强大，他们深信他们能够克服任何困难和障碍。“我们必须耐心，坚信我们能够取得比我们现有成就更大的成就。”
    卡塞姆总理表示相信，和平将永远胜利。他说，“侵略是决不会得逞的，它终将被粉碎。不论是集体或者个人的侵略都必然要遭到粉碎。”卡塞姆总理说，他本人将永远为和平而奋斗。他还说，伊拉克已经准备好军队力量，以便用来对付那些破坏和平的人。
    卡塞姆总理对伊拉克的和平战士们说，“某些搞阴谋活动的分裂分子已经渗入到你们的队伍里，以便在你们中间散布不和的种子和破坏国内的民主精神。因此要提防他们，因为我们不希望在这个国家摆脱了屈辱和没有权利的地位以后，在获得了自由以后，这种民主精神受到破坏。”
    卡塞姆总理重申，他不属于任何倾向和趋势，不属于任何党派。他说，他正在为全体人民的福利而努力，并且为他们服务。
    他又说，“我支持和同情一切政党，只要它们的目的是为祖国服务，为自由和和平服务。没有什么东西能够把我同它们隔开，无论是宗教、语言或者民族。我们在自由和和平的行列里携手并进。”
    新华社巴格达14日电　伊拉克和平战士全国委员会秘书长阿齐兹·谢里夫今天上午在伊拉克第二次和平战士代表大会上致开幕词时说，举行这次代表大会的目的是，“第一、继续动员国内和国际舆论，以便同威胁和侵略我们共和国的活动进行斗争；第二、同世界和平运动一起，继续为争取解决有关世界和平的各项问题而努力，并且为在世界和平理事会建立十周年时将要举行的斯德哥尔摩和平大会进行准备。”
    阿齐兹·谢里夫指出，伊拉克的和平战士在旧政权统治下参加了人民解放斗争的行列。他们之中的很多人付出了生命，或者遭受监禁、拷问、流放和被剥夺国籍。
    他说，伊拉克和阿拉伯人民将永远不会忘记苏联和其他社会主义国家对伊拉克共和国的有力支持，并且不会忘记三亿中国人民举行示威游行来声援伊拉克革命的行动。
    阿齐兹·谢里夫继续说，沙瓦夫的叛乱迅速被击败了，这是因为“和平和自由的力量同我们在一起。强大的和平阵营同我们在一起，它的强大的力量是帝国主义和战争势力所不能战胜的”。
    据新华社巴格达15日电　伊拉克第二次和平战士代表大会14日在热烈的气氛中举行了第一天会议。
    应邀参加大会的外国代表团在大会上致词祝贺。
    苏联代表扎达赫在发言中向为和平、自由和民族独立而斗争的伊拉克人民所取得的胜利致敬。他保证苏联支持阿拉伯国家。他说：“苏联的友谊是可靠的，它决没有忘记对反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的朋友尽它的责任”。他在发言结束时宣读了苏联保卫世界和平委员会致代表大会的贺电。
    中国代表包尔汉指出，争取民族独立的斗争是争取和平的斗争的一部分。伊拉克人民对世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。他祝伊拉克和平战士在反对帝国主义以及保卫共和国和世界和平方面取得更大成就。
    在会上讲话的还有世界和平理事会、伊朗、黎巴嫩、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的代表。他们都向代表大会致贺，并且表示完全支持伊拉克和平运动。
