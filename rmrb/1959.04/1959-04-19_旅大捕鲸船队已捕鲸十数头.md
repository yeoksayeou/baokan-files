Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 16th - The Lüda whaling fleet has achieved initial success this year. Since setting out to sea in early spring, the fleet has captured three fin whales and eleven minke whales, totaling over 120 tons. Whaling ships No. 1 and No. 504 have both set a record of catching three whales in a single day.

At the beginning of this year, the whalers here, based on the earlier-than-usual warming trend, broke with convention and set out to sea in mid-March, one month earlier than in previous years. On the first and second days at sea, they discovered schools of minke whales. After concentrated operations by the whaling fleet's three whaling ships, they captured six minke whales. On April 6th, Xu Xiyi, a young gunner with a background in naval artillery, hit a fin whale weighing over 30 tons with a single shot. Due to the excellent cooperation among the three whaling ships, they set a record of catching three fin whales in a single day. Currently, schools of whales are abundant at sea, ranging from three to five to over a hundred. The whalers are seizing the opportunity to continue the hunt.

　　旅大捕鲸船队已捕鲸十数头
    新华社旅大16日电　旅大的捕鲸船队今年首战告捷。这个船队自春初出海以来，已捕获了三头长须鲸、十一头小鳁鲸，共重一百二十多吨。捕鲸船一号和五零四号都创造了日捕三头鲸的纪录。
    今年年初，这里的捕鲸手们根据气温转暖较早的情况，打破常规，比往年提前一个月在3月中旬先后出海。出海第一、二天，他们就发现了鳁鲸群，经过捕鲸船队三艘鲸轮集中作业，捕获了六头小鳁鲸。4月6日，海军炮兵出身的青年炮手徐熙义一炮便命中了一头重三十余吨的长须鲸。由于三艘鲸轮互相协作得好，创造了日捕三头长须鲸的纪录。目前，海上的鲸鱼成群，少则三五头，多的有百余头。捕鲸手们正在乘胜追捕中。
