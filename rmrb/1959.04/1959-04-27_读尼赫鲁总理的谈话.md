Reading Premier Nehru's Talk
Commentator of this newspaper

    Indian Prime Minister Nehru gave several talks before and after meeting the Dalai Lama on April 24. Prime Minister Nehru's remarks after meeting the Dalai Lama confirmed the truthfulness of the letters written by the Dalai Lama about his abduction by Tibetan reactionaries. This will certainly help clarify many incorrect opinions on this issue in Indian public opinion and political circles. In addition, Prime Minister Nehru also expressed his continued willingness to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and repeatedly expressed his hope that those in India who are making a big issue of the Tibet issue would "exercise wisdom and self-control and be responsible in what they say on this matter." We welcome these expressions from Prime Minister Nehru that are beneficial to Sino-Indian friendship.
    The three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan are an important key to understanding the nature of the Tibetan rebellion and the Dalai Lama's situation after March 10. In these three letters, the Dalai Lama not only, as Prime Minister Nehru said, "hoped to avoid conflict with the Chinese." He repeatedly pointed out that he was being "obstructed," "endangered," and his "life was not guaranteed," and that those who "protected" him in name but obstructed him and endangered him were "bad people," "reactionary bad elements," "illegal" "reactionary groups," "arrogant," "seriously alienating the relationship between the central and local governments," and "reactionary elements" who "opposed the revolution." The Dalai Lama was "infinitely saddened" by being kidnapped by these reactionary elements and was "ashamed and anxious, in a state of helplessness." Does this not fully prove that he was indeed kidnapped? Although the Dalai Lama "tried to calm" the illegal acts, "ordered the illegal People's Conference to be dissolved immediately, and ordered the reactionary elements who had arrogantly entered the Norbulingka in the name of protecting me to withdraw immediately," and "educated more than seventy representatives of government officials, etc.," it is very clear that his government officials, who had already betrayed him, did not listen to his orders at all. According to Khenchung Thupten Damba, who participated in the meeting convened by the Dalai Lama on March 14, the Dalai Lama clearly declared at this meeting to educate government officials: "Some people may think it is better for me to go to India. This approach is only for personal comfort. I have been to Yadong before, and I also went to India the year before last. It is not possible to live there. I only want to enjoy karma in my own land." According to the Dalai Lama's third letter to General Tan Guansan on March 16, his plan at the time was to "go to the military region in a secret manner" in a few days and request the military region to "also take reliable measures." Until 4 p.m. on March 17, according to Prime Minister Nehru's talk, the Dalai Lama still had no intention of leaving Lhasa and going into exile in India. Suddenly, Prime Minister Nehru continued, when "according to the statement (Indian Press Trust note refers to the statement issued by the Dalai Lama in Tezpur) ‘those shells or something fell on his palace’—whatever the reason—this then had a strong impact on his thinking. Since everything was over, ‘let's go,’ so they left within six hours." Please note: According to the Tezpur statement on April 18, "two or three mortar shells were fired," "fortunately, the shells all fell into a nearby pond." Only six days later, "or something" was added behind the shells, the "pond" became the "palace," and "no matter what the reason" was added! Two or three unknown things for unknown reasons fell into the palace or a nearby pond, which would suddenly give the kidnapped Dalai Lama freedom and power to "voluntarily" leave Lhasa with the reactionary elements he deeply hated to a place he did not want to go! Can all this convince anyone with an objective attitude and a calm mind? Does this not clearly prove that the rebellious elements who kidnapped the Dalai Lama arbitrarily fabricated a rumor to intimidate the Dalai Lama (which is what the Tezpur statement called "the advisors realized the danger to the Dalai Lama's person... leaving Lhasa became very urgent") and kidnapped him from Lhasa to India without explanation? As the Bengali daily "Yugantar" in India commented on April 20: if the Dalai Lama's three letters to General Tan Guansan "have even a certain degree of truth, then what is the value of the Dalai Lama's current statement (referring to the Tezpur statement)?" We sincerely hope that all Indian friends, including our respected Prime Minister Nehru, will finally be able to reach the same conclusion as us, that is: since the Dalai Lama himself confirmed the authenticity of the three letters he wrote to General Tan Guansan, he was indeed kidnapped, and the Tezpur statement is still a product of kidnapping, completely unable to represent the Dalai Lama's will and completely unable to reflect the true situation of the Tibetan rebellion.
    Prime Minister Nehru said to members of the Congress Party on the 24th that the Tibet incident has created difficult problems for India. The Indian government is facing a difficult situation that has already caused confusion. Prime Minister Nehru's mood is understandable. Prime Minister Nehru said that it is irresponsible to express opinions on some complex issues without understanding all the facts. We believe that the Indian government's troubles are caused or increased to a considerable extent by this.
    The Indian government has repeatedly stated that Tibet is a part of China's territory and that India has no territorial or political ambitions in Tibet. However, some Indian politicians are so enthusiastic about interfering in China's internal affairs in Tibet that it far exceeds what a patient and friendly neighbor can tolerate. The People's Republic of China is a serious country, and it holds a solemn attitude towards what it declares it will implement. China must liberate Tibet, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army did indeed enter Tibet. The Central People's Government of China signed the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet with the Tibetan Local Government, stipulating that national regional autonomy should be implemented in Tibet. The Central People's Government did indeed strictly implement the Seventeen-Article Agreement and actively prepared for Tibetan local autonomy, which would have been realized long ago (just like in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Ningxia) if it were not for the vigorous obstruction of the original Tibetan local government. China and India signed the Agreement on Trade and Communication between the Tibet Region of China and India, which first stipulated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government did indeed strictly abide by this agreement, strictly implement the Five Principles, not interfere in India's internal affairs, and also refuse any foreign interference in China's internal affairs. Our Indian friends are familiar with this attitude of China and have no reason to criticize China's attitude. Since this is the case, why do some Indian politicians have to doubt the official documents of the Chinese government on the Tibet issue and insist on carrying out propaganda of distrusting China and interfering in China's internal affairs, thus creating troubles for themselves?
    Prime Minister Nehru said: We cannot turn a deaf ear to everything we say to others. This probably refers to the recent counterattack by the Chinese people against Indian expansionists' interference in China's internal affairs. Indeed, the long-standing friendly relations between China and India have been damaged in the past few weeks, which is regrettable. But this is not China's fault. Everyone knows that China has not interfered in India's internal affairs, and Tibet is not Indian territory. However, before the outbreak of the Tibetan rebellion, from February this year, many newspapers in India spread many remarks predicting that a rebellion would occur in Tibet. After the outbreak of the Tibetan rebellion, many newspapers in India were simply as if they had encountered a festival, and published a large number of unfriendly remarks against China. According to statistics of twenty-nine Indian newspapers and periodicals from February 24 to April 7 (not including the more surging twenty days recently), more than 310,000 words of news and comments on the Tibetan rebellion were published. But everyone knows that China's reaction has been exceptionally restrained for a long time. Even after some people slandered the Chinese government in the Indian parliament and organized anti-China demonstrations in front of the Chinese embassy and consulates in India, Premier Zhou Enlai still expressed the hope that the friendly relations between the two countries would continue to develop in his report to the National People's Congress, and did not condemn these extremely unfriendly words and deeds. However, all this did not make those expansionists in India know how to restrain themselves. They used the so-called Dalai Lama's statement to launch a large-scale attack on China, openly demanding "Tibetan independence," demanding a round table meeting of New Delhi, Beijing, and Lhasa, publishing cartoons insulting the Chinese head of state in newspapers, and even organizing demonstrations insulting the Chinese head of state. This is tolerable, but what is intolerable?! Only at this time did the Chinese people express their irrepressible righteous indignation. Even so, the Chinese people, who cherish Sino-Indian friendship, have never acted like some Indians who deliberately undermine Sino-Indian friendship. On the contrary, our struggle is limited to opposing Indian interventionists and expansionists, and the counterattack against these people is necessary. Since Indian expansionists have poured a torrential rain of poison on Sino-Indian friendly relations, necessary disinfection work must be carried out. Otherwise, Sino-Indian friendship cannot be consolidated.
    Prime Minister Nehru expressed concern about the future of the Dalai Lama. We are of course more concerned about the future of the Dalai Lama. We believe that after confirming the authenticity of the Dalai Lama's letters to General Tan Guansan, this issue should be easily resolved. The Dalai Lama was originally unwilling to go to India. Even if believing the words of his advisors, it was only two unknown things that fell into his palace or a nearby pond for unknown reasons that forced him to leave Lhasa inexplicably. If people really sympathize with the Dalai Lama, instead of sympathizing with those heinous bandits who kidnapped the Dalai Lama, they have a moral responsibility to help him realize his wishes in his letters to General Tan Guansan. We believe that unless the people who kidnapped the Dalai Lama are determined to force the Dalai Lama to permanently withdraw from Tibetan political life, and the Indian side also supports their determination, the Dalai Lama will eventually return to his lovely motherland.

    读尼赫鲁总理的谈话
    本报评论员
    印度总理尼赫鲁在4月24日会见达赖喇嘛之前和以后，接连发表了几次谈话。尼赫鲁总理在会见达赖以后发表的谈话，证实了达赖喇嘛所写的关于他被西藏反动分子劫持的信件是真实的。这当然会促使印度舆论界和政界在这个问题上的许多不正确意见得到澄清。此外，尼赫鲁总理还表示仍然愿意坚持和平共处的五项原则，并且一再表示希望印度的那些就西藏问题大发议论的人们“运用智慧和自制，在这个问题上说什么话的时候要有责任感”。我们欢迎尼赫鲁总理的这些有益于中印友好的表示。
    达赖喇嘛写给谭冠三将军的三封信，对于认识西藏叛乱的性质和达赖喇嘛在3月10日以后的处境，是一个重要关键。在这三封信里，达赖喇嘛不仅像尼赫鲁总理谈话所说，“希望避免同中国人发生冲突”而已。他再三指明他是被“拦阻”，被“危害”“生命难保”，而那些以“保卫”他为名而拦阻他、危害他的人是“坏人”，是“反动的坏分子”，是“违法”的“反动集团”，是“狂妄”的、“严重离间中央与地方关系”的、“反对革命”的“反动分子”。达赖喇嘛因为受到这些反动分子的劫持而“无限忧伤”，而“害羞难言，忧虑交加，处于莫知所措的境地”。这还不是完全证明了他确是被劫持了吗？达赖喇嘛虽然“设法平息”违法行为，“责令非法的人民会议必须立即解散，以保卫我为名而狂妄地进驻罗布林卡的反动分子必须立即撤走”，并“向政府官员等的代表七十余人进行了教育”，但是非常明显，他的已经背叛了的政府官员根本不听他的命令。据参加达赖喇嘛在3月14日召集的会议的堪穷土登丹巴证明，达赖喇嘛在这次向政府官员进行教育的会议上曾经明白宣布：“有些人可能认为我到印度去为好，这种作法只能是为了个人的安乐。以前我去过亚东，前年也去过印度。住在那边是不行的，我只想在自己的土地上享受因果。”根据达赖喇嘛3月16日写给谭冠三将军的第三封信，他当时的计划还是在几天以后“采取秘密的方式前往军区”，并要求军区“亦采取可靠的措施”。直到3月17日下午四时，据尼赫鲁总理的谈话说，达赖喇嘛仍然没有想到离开拉萨，流亡印度。忽然，尼赫鲁总理接着说，当“据声明（印度报业托辣斯原注是指达赖喇嘛在提斯浦尔发表的声明）说‘那些炮弹或者什么东西落在他的宫殿’——不管是什么原因——的时候，这于是就对他的想法产生了强烈的影响。既然一切都完了，‘我们走吧’，于是他们就在六小时以内离开了。”请注意：据4月18日提斯浦尔声明，是“迫击炮打了两三炮”，“幸而炮弹都落到附近的一个池塘里去了。”只隔了六天，炮弹后面就加上了“或者什么东西”，“池塘”就变成了“宫殿”，而且加上“不管是什么原因”！两个或者两三个不知什么东西不知什么原因落到宫殿或者附近的一个池塘里，就会使被劫持的达赖喇嘛忽然得到自由和权力，“自愿”同他所深恶痛绝的反动分子离开拉萨到他不愿意去的地方！这一切难道能使任何有客观态度冷静头脑的人信服吗？这还不是明明证明，劫持达赖喇嘛的叛乱分子向达赖喇嘛任意编造了一个恐吓他的谣言，（也就是提斯浦尔声明所谓“顾问们认识到对于达赖喇嘛人身的危险……离开拉萨就成为十分紧迫的了”。）就此不由分说，把他劫出拉萨，劫到印度去了吗？印度孟加拉文日报“划时代报”4月20日的评论说得好：如果达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信“甚至有一定程度的真实性的话，那么达赖喇嘛目前的声明（指提斯浦尔声明）还有什么价值呢？”我们恳切地希望，所有印度的朋友，包括我们尊敬的尼赫鲁总理，终于能够达到同我们一样的结论，即：既然达赖喇嘛亲自证实了他写给谭冠三将军的三封信，他就是确实被劫持了，而提斯浦尔的声明就仍然是被劫持的产物，完全不能代表达赖喇嘛的意志，完全不能反映西藏叛乱的真实情况。
    尼赫鲁总理在24日对国大党人说：西藏事件为印度造成了困难问题。印度政府正面临着一种已经引起了混乱的困难局面。尼赫鲁总理的这种心境是可以理解的。尼赫鲁总理说，在还不了解全部事实的时候就对一些复杂的问题表示意见，是不太负责的做法。我们以为，印度政府的烦恼在相当的程度上是由此而引起或者由此而增加的。
    印度政府再三声明，西藏是中国的领土的一部分，印度对西藏决没有领土的和政治的野心。但是印度某些政界人士对于中国在西藏的内政如此热心于干预，却远远超过了一个耐心的友好的邻人所能忍受的程度。中华人民共和国是一个严肃的国家，它对于它所宣布要实行的东西持有郑重的态度。中国一定要解放西藏，
  中国人民解放军就果然进驻西藏。中国的中央人民政府同西藏地方政府签订了和平解放的十七条协议，规定在西藏要实行民族区域自治，中央人民政府就果然严格执行十七条协议，积极筹备西藏地方自治，这种自治本来早已会实现了（就像在内蒙、新疆、广西、宁夏一样），如果不是原西藏地方政府竭力阻挠的话。中国和印度签订了关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定，其中首先规定了和平共处的五项原则，中国政府就果然严格遵守这个协定，严格执行五项原则，不干涉印度的内政，也拒绝任何外国干涉中国的内政。我们的印度朋友熟知中国的这种态度，而且没有理由非难中国的态度。既然如此，印度的某些政界人士为什么硬要在西藏问题上怀疑中国政府的正式文告，硬要进行不信任中国和干预中国内政的宣传，因而自寻烦恼呢？
    尼赫鲁总理说：我们对别人说我们的一切话不能充耳不闻。这大概是指中国人民近日对于印度扩张主义分子干涉中国内政的反击。诚然，中印两国具有悠久历史的友好关系，在过去几个星期中受到了损害，这是令人惋惜的。但是这并不是中国方面的过错。谁都知道，中国并没有干涉印度的内政，而西藏并不是印度的领土。但是在西藏叛乱事件发生以前，从今年2月开始，印度的一些报纸上就散布了许多预告西藏将要发生叛乱的言论。而在西藏叛乱事件发生以后，印度的许多报纸简直就像遇到了节庆一般，连篇累牍地发出了大量的对中国不友好的言论。据对二十九家印度报刊从2月24日到4月7日（没有包括最近更高涨的二十天）的统计，就发表了有关西藏叛乱的新闻和评论三十一万余字。但是大家知道，中国的反应在长时间内是异常克制的。甚至有人在印度的国会中诽谤中国政府，并且在中国驻印度的使馆和领事馆门前组织了反华示威之后，周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会上的报告中仍然表示希望两国的友好关系继续发展，并没有对这些极不友好的言行加以谴责。但是，这一切并没有使印度的那些扩张主义分子知所检点。他们利用所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，对中国大肆攻击，公然要求“西藏独立”，要求召集新德里、北京、拉萨三方面的圆桌会议，在报纸上发表污辱中国元首的漫画，甚至组织污辱中国国家元首的示威。是可忍，孰不可忍？！直到这时，中国人民才表示了不能抑止的义愤。虽然如此，珍惜中印友谊的中国人民，始终没有像一些蓄意破坏中印友谊的印度人那样地行动。相反，我们的斗争限于反对印度的干涉者和扩张主义分子，对于这些人的回击是必要的。印度扩张主义分子既然在中印友好关系上下了倾盆毒雨，就不能不进行必要的消毒工作。否则，中印的友谊就无法巩固。
    尼赫鲁总理表示关心达赖喇嘛的前途。我们当然更关心达赖喇嘛的前途。我们以为，在证实了达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的信件的真实性以后，这个问题应当是容易解决了。达赖喇嘛本来不愿意到印度。即令相信他的顾问们的话，也只是两个不知什么东西不知什么原因掉在他的宫殿或者附近的池塘里，才迫使他莫名其妙地离开拉萨。人们如果真的同情达赖喇嘛，而不是同情那些劫持达赖喇嘛的万恶的叛匪，就有道义上的责任帮助他实现他在给谭冠三将军的信件中的愿望。我们相信，除非劫持达赖喇嘛的人下定决心，硬要使达赖喇嘛永远退出西藏的政治生活，而印度方面也赞助他们的这种决心，否则，达赖喇嘛终于会回到可爱的祖国来的。
