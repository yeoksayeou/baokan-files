　　Returning to Fuzhou
　　Gao Shiqi
　　In this most beautiful time of spring, we have returned to Fuzhou for inspection.

　　We see that this city of beautiful mountains and clear waters is renewing its appearance day by day.

　　The streets have changed, the roads have been widened, and new buildings are being built one after another. High-rise buildings have replaced tile-roofed wooden houses. The roadsides have been greened, and today's Fuzhou is even more beautiful.

　　In my childhood memories, Fuzhou was not so good. In the old Fuzhou under reactionary rule, it was narrow and dilapidated, with floods almost every year and epidemics rampant.

　　After liberation, the Party and the People's Government cared about the people's suffering. In 1952, a thick and solid Minjiang River flood control dike was built to protect Fuzhou from floods.

　　Over the years, under the leadership of the Party, the patriotic health campaign, with the elimination of the four pests as its main focus, has been very successful. Mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows have been greatly reduced, and plague and cholera have long been eradicated.

　　The long-awaited waterworks was also completed last year. This is a modern waterworks, and its design and installation were all done by our own people. All inspection and disinfection procedures meet the latest scientific standards.

　　Since the direct train from Shanghai to Fuzhou was opened, the freight traffic has been continuous, which has given a strong impetus to Fuzhou's industry, promoting its development and prosperity.

　　In the past, Fuzhou did not have a single factory. Even if there were one or two lathes, they only did repair work. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant light of the General Line, many newly built factories, such as the Fuzhou Paper Mill, the Fuzhou General Machinery Factory, and the Fuzhou Enamel Factory, have recently been put into production. Many factories are still under construction, and the construction workers are extremely busy. The world-famous Fuzhou bodiless lacquerware has also established a factory, transitioning from handicraft to semi-mechanized production. Although there are still difficulties in industrial production, such as insufficient supply of raw materials, insufficient power, and weak technical strength, the people's soaring enthusiasm and ideological liberation, and the spirit of bold creation and bold innovation, will surely completely overcome these difficulties.

　　The waves of the Great Leap Forward are also washing away the backwardness of the countryside, setting off a high tide of industrial and agricultural production.

　　In the rural areas of Fuzhou suburbs, we inspected the Chengmeng, Gushan, and Gaishan People's Communes. After listening to the reports, we were deeply moved. The commune is really a good place and a good organization. Here, we see that due to the enthusiasm and creativity of the members, agricultural production has achieved a great harvest. For example, the Chengmeng Commune's total grain output in 1958 doubled that of 1957, and the "small year" for tangerines became a "big year," with an increase of 20% over 1957.

　　Here, we see that the members have established many factories and ranches. The Chengmeng Commune has 480 factories of all sizes and 56 ranches, raising more than 1,200 dairy cows and nearly 30,000 pigs. They also operate many other sideline businesses, such as raising chickens, bees, and fish. There are public canteens and unmanned shops, nurseries, kindergartens, laundry groups, and sewing groups, and women's labor is greatly liberated, truly achieving equality between men and women. There are homes for the elderly, so that the elderly's happy old age is taken care of.

　　Very different from the past, all public places, canteens, houses, and streets are cleaned up. The garbage dumps and rubble fields of the past have been planted with flowers, plants, and trees, and have become small parks by the roadside. This is the initial achievement of rural landscaping. Everywhere in the commune, we can see many slogans, poems, and cartoons of the Great Leap Forward on the walls. This is a major feature of today's Chinese countryside. On a wall in the Chengmeng Commune, we also saw poems and paintings left by the poet Tian Jian and the painter Mi Gu.

　　What interests me most is a juvenile farm in the Gushan Commune. This juvenile farm covers an area of about ten mu. The children take turns coming here to cultivate during their spare time, which plays a certain role in cultivating the younger generation's habit of loving labor.

　　Fuzhou, this heroic city, faces the arduous tasks of fighting the enemy and supporting the front lines, and at the same time can carry out industrial and agricultural production labor in a faster, better, and more economical way, and fight for the construction of a socialist motherland. This is encouraging and commendable.

### 回到福州

　　回到福州
　　高士其
    在这春光春色最明媚的时候，我们又回到福州来视察。
    我们看到这个山明水秀的城市，它的面貌日日在更新。
    街道改观、马路加宽，新的建筑物一座一座地兴建起来，高楼大厦代替了瓦屋木房，道旁都已绿化，今天的福州更加美丽了。
    在我童年的回忆里，福州并没有这样好。在反动统治下的旧福州，它是又狭窄又破烂，几乎每年都有洪水为灾，疫疠流行。
    解放后，党和人民政府关心人民的疾苦，在1952年就已建成厚而坚固的闽江防洪堤，使福州免除水患。
    历年来，在党的领导下，以除四害为主的爱国卫生运动作得很有成绩，蚊、蝇、鼠、雀大为减少，鼠疫、霍乱早已绝迹了。
    盼望已久的自来水厂，也于去年完成，这是一座现代化的自来水厂，它的设计和安装都是由我国人民自己办的，一切检查和消毒手续，都合乎最新科学标准。
    自从上海到福州的直达火车通车以后，来往的货运络绎不断，这给福州的工业以有力的刺激，促进它的发展和繁荣。
    过去，福州没有一个工厂，就是有一两台车床，也只是做修配工作。大跃进以来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，有许多新建的工厂，如福州造纸厂、福州通用机器厂、福州搪瓷厂等最近都投入了生产，有许多工厂还在基建中，建筑工人大忙特忙。著名于世的福州脱胎漆器，也设立了工厂，由手工业过渡到半机械化生产了。虽然在目前工业生产上还存在着原料供应不上、电力不足和技术力量薄弱的困难，但是，人们的冲天干劲和思想解放，大胆创造、大胆革新的精神，一定可以把这些困难完全克服的。
    大跃进的浪涛，也冲洗着农村的落后面貌，掀起了工农业生产的高潮。
  在福州郊区农村，我们视察了城门、鼓山、盖山三个人民公社，听过了汇报之后，我们都深深地受到感动。公社真是一个好地方、好组织。在这里，我们看到由于发挥社员的积极性和创造性，农业生产获得大丰收，例如城门公社，1958年的粮食总产量比1957年翻了一番，甘枸“小年”变“大年”，比1957年增产了20％。
    在这里，我们看到社员们兴办了许多工厂和牧场，城门公社就办有四百八十个大大小小的工厂，五十六个牧场，养奶牛一千二百多头，养猪近三万只；还经营了许多其他副业，如养鸡、养蜂、养鱼等等。这里有公共食堂和无人商店，有托儿所、幼儿园、洗衣组和缝纫组，妇女劳动力得到大解放，真正作到男女平等；有敬老院，使老人的幸福晚年都得到了照顾。
    和过去大不相同，各公共场所、食堂、房屋和街道都收拾得干干净净，过去的垃圾堆和瓦砾场，都种植了花草树木，变成路旁的小公园了，这是农村园林化的初步成绩。在公社到处都可以看到墙壁上出现了许多跃进的标语、诗歌和漫画，这是今天中国农村一大特色。在城门公社里，有一处墙上，我们还看到诗人田间和画家米谷留下的诗和画。
    使我最感兴趣的，就是鼓山公社的一个少年农场，这个少年农场，占地约十亩，孩子们在课余的时间轮流来到这里耕种，这对培养少年儿童一代热爱劳动的习惯，是起了一定的作用的。
    福州，这个英雄的城市，面临着对敌斗争和支援前线的繁重任务，同时又能多快好省地进行工农业生产劳动，为建设社会主义的祖国而斗争，这是令人鼓舞和赞扬的。
