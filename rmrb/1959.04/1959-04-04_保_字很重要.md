"Protect" is very important
Pests and diseases are the great enemies of agricultural production. No matter how good the seeds, seedlings, and grains are, they will suffer serious losses once they are attacked. In order to avoid such unexpected disasters, the "Agricultural Charter" specifically stipulates a "protect" character, which requires people to pay attention to preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests while carrying out intensive cultivation, protecting crops to grow safely, and protecting the fruits of people's hard work from damage.

After compiling the news about the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests—especially the annihilation of rice field insects by the Shiquan People's Commune's Shantian Brigade in Hengshan County—we were greatly encouraged, and at the same time, we are more firmly convinced that as long as everyone takes action, prevents early, and vigorously eliminates and treats them, it is entirely possible to completely eliminate diseases and insect pests.

    “保”字很重要
    病虫害是农业生产的大敌，不管怎样好的种子、禾苗和籽粒，一旦受到它的侵袭，便会造成严重损失。为了免除这种意外灾害，“农业宪法”中特别规定了一个“保”字，就是要人们在精耕细作的同时，还要时刻注意防治病虫害，保护农作物平安生长，保护人们辛勤劳动的果实不受损害。
    编完防治病虫害——特别是衡山县沙泉公社山田大队歼灭稻田虫的消息后，受到很大鼓舞，同时也更加坚定地相信，只要人人动手，及早预防，大力除治，彻底消除病虫害是完全可能的。
