　　Tapping the Potential of Time
　　Hua Gong
    Within the prescribed working hours, how are we utilizing our time? Is there potential to be tapped? This is a question worthy of deep consideration.

    Time has always been precious to us. Currently, in order to shake off the backward state of economic "poverty and blankness" as soon as possible, we must race against time in our labor. However, labor time is limited, because workers need ample time for learning, recreation, rest, and dealing with their personal affairs. But, in order to make our country economically prosperous and rapidly improve the people's lives, we need to do many, many things. Since daily working hours are fixed, this requires us to engage in more effective and creative labor during our working hours.

    The waste of working hours is not just an isolated phenomenon in many factories and mines. In many units, the waste of working hours caused by poor preparation before production, late and unspecific planning arrangements, lack of close coordination between various processes, and other reasons exists to varying degrees. Therefore, mobilizing the masses to carefully calculate whether working hours have been fully utilized and fully exploiting the potential of working hours is a very meaningful task.

    There is a saying that to achieve a leap forward in production, working hours must be extended. The actual situation is not entirely like this. Superficially, a factory may appear very busy from morning to night, but this does not mean that every process, every link, and every worker is making full use of their working time. If we conduct a careful investigation and study, and do the math, we will find all kinds of loopholes, big and small. This means there is still potential in working time. Those who hold such an idea have not seen this potential. The best way to see this potential and bring it into play is to calculate the utilization.

    The more detailed the economic work, the more detailed the accounting must be, because once the accounts are calculated, many problems become clear. It can solve both ideological and practical problems.

### 挖时间的潜力

　　挖时间的潜力
　　华工
    在规定的作业时间内，我们对时间利用的情况如何？有没有潜力可挖？这是很值得深思的问题。
    时间对我们来说，从来都是宝贵的。当前，我们为了早日摆脱经济上“一穷二白”的落后状况，必须分秒必争地进行劳动。但劳动的时间是有限制的，因为要使劳动者有充分的时间进行学习、娱乐、休息和处理自己的生活问题。但是，为了使我们的国家经济上富裕起来，人民的生活迅速得到提高，我们需要做很多很多的事情，但每天的劳动时间是有规定的，这就要求在作业时间，更有效地进行创造性的劳动。
    工时浪费状况，在许多厂矿企业中并不仅仅是个别的现象。在许多单位内，因生产前的准备工作不好，计划安排得晚，不具体，各工序间协作配合不密切等等原因，而造成浪费工时的情况，都不同程度的存在着。因此，发动群众，算一算作业时间是否已经充分利用的细账，把作业时间的潜力充分发挥出来，是件很有意义的工作。
    有这样一种说法，认为生产要跃进，必须延长工时。实际情况并非完全如此，从表面上看，一个工厂内从早到晚很紧张，但这并不等于每个工序，每个环节，每个工人都把作业时间充分利用起来了。假如仔细调查研究一番，算算账，就会发现大大小小的各种漏洞。这就是说，工作时间上还有潜力。有这种思想的人，就是没有看到这种潜力。要看到这种潜力，并把它发挥出来，最好的办法就是算算利用账。
    经济工作愈做愈细，账也要愈算愈细，因为账一算，很多问题就清楚了，既能解决思想问题，也能解决实际问题。
