Xinhua News Agency, April 17th. When the Polish People's Army men's and women's volleyball teams held their second friendly match in Beijing tonight, the women's team lost to the Chinese Youth Women's Volleyball Team with a score of 0 to 3 (5 to 15, 11 to 15, 9 to 15); the men's team defeated the Chinese Youth Men's Volleyball Team with a score of 3 to 2 (15 to 12, 15 to 13, 7 to 15, 14 to 16, 15 to 10).

　　Tonight's men's team match was the most intense. The Polish People's Army men's team had relatively comprehensive offensive and defensive techniques. Each player mastered a variety of spiking and dinking techniques, posing a great threat to the Chinese Youth Team. The Chinese Youth Team players were agile and had more tactical changes, but they were not calm enough in the match. In the fifth game, which determined the outcome, they made continuous mistakes and finally lost to the experienced visiting team.

　　Panchen Erdeni, representative of the National People's Congress and Acting Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Zhang Jingwu, Central Government Representative in Tibet, attended the friendly match tonight. Panchen Erdeni's accompanying officials also watched the game tonight.

　　Polish Ambassador to China, Kirylok, also attended the friendly match tonight.

　　波人民军排球队在京举行第二次比赛
    新华社17日讯　波兰人民军男、女排球队今晚在北京举行第二次友谊比赛时，女子队以○比三（五比十五、十一比十五、九比十五）败给中国青年女子排球队；男子队以三比二（十五比十二、十五比十三、七比十五、十四比十六、十五比十）战胜中国青年男子排球队。
    今晚男子队的比赛最紧张。波兰人民军男子队进攻和防守技术比较全面，每个队员都掌握了多样的扣球和吊球技术，给中国青年队很大威胁。中国青年队队员动作灵活，战术变化比较多，但他们在比赛中不够沉着，在决定胜负的第五局中，连续失误，最后败给了有经验的客队。
    全国人民代表大会代表、西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼和中央驻西藏代表张经武一起，出席观看了今晚的友谊比赛。观看今晚球赛的，还有班禅额尔德尼的随行官员。
    波兰驻中国大使基里洛克也出席观看了今晚的友谊比赛。
