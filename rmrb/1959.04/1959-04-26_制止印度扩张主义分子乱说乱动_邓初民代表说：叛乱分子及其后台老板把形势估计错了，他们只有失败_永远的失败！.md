Deputy Deng Chumin Says: The Rebels and Their Backstage Bosses Have Misjudged the Situation; They Will Only Fail—Forever!

Chairman, fellow deputies:

Spring has arrived! The spring breeze has blown open the flowers, turned the earth green, and brought the good news of the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959. In this season of renewal, with birds singing and flowers fragrant, people are working selflessly with a hundredfold, a thousandfold, a myriadfold diligence, preparing to offer bountiful gifts to the evergreen motherland, to the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. It was in such an inspiring season that I, dragging a body sick for ten years, went to Wuhan, Shashi, Xinchang (my hometown), Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places for inspection. I traveled all over the cities, villages, construction sites, scenic spots, factories, mines, schools, hospitals, and people's communes, learned a lot, and collected a lot of materials, which I have reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress by means of communications. Now I will only summarize some impressions and feelings.

Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, it is not just that we have entered a blooming spring, but in this era of the Great Leap Forward, our motherland has no winter at all. Therefore, what I have seen is that, no matter on which front of the economy, politics, or culture, on which post, people have not stopped their steps for a single second. I saw the No. 1 blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation flowing out furnace after furnace of molten iron; the workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation are going to complete more than 30 three-dimensional projects of nine large factories and mines this year, including the No. 2 (now completed) and No. 3 blast furnaces, which are even higher and larger than the No. 1 blast furnace; I saw the mechanical workers concentrating their efforts on attacking the six major equipments; I saw the wheat, rapeseed, and early rice in Jiangnan, with patches of green and patches of yellow dazzling the eyes; I saw the herds of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese of the communes, strong and fat; I saw the drums of accumulating fertilizer and preparing for farming, reforming agricultural tools, and preparing for drainage and irrigation beating non-stop; I saw the various production indicators rising continuously along the red arrow; I saw and heard the heroic words of the red flag high-quality and high-yield competition and striving to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, deafening. During these two months, I seemed to be on the battlefield of thousands of troops and horses, my sick body turned into a strong man, I couldn't wait to raise my arms, split a mountain, scoop up a river of water, and I was always full of the joy of engaging in a fierce battle and hard work.

Naturally, the more energetic people are, the faster the leap forward is, and the more comfortable people feel. The beautiful scenes of songs all over the cities and countryside and poems and paintings on the walls made me feel that there is endless spring in the vast land.

In this fighting atmosphere of boundless spring, red flags flying, high morale, and unity from top to bottom, people's mood is comfortable and people's lives are democratic. This is because under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have established a political situation that is not only democratic but also centralized, not only free but also disciplined, not only unified in will but also comfortable and lively.

This has changed the relationship between people, brought into play the initiative and creativity of the people, established the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and seeking truth from facts, embodied the great unity of all nationalities, united around the Party and Chairman Mao, and formed a democratic and harmonious unified family of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all different religious beliefs. In our unified multi-ethnic motherland family, more than 50 fraternal nationalities live together, distributed in vast areas. These fraternal nationalities have been jointly laboring and producing on the land of the motherland since ancient times, and have long-standing and close economic cooperation and cultural exchanges with each other, jointly creating the history and culture of the motherland.

Therefore, I specially visited the branch of the Central Institute for Nationalities in Wuhan and its affiliated Cultural Relics Museum. The college includes 19 ethnic groups, including Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Hui, Dong, Li, Tujia, and Gaoshan, who are as close as brothers and sisters and are treated preferentially. All students are given people's scholarships by the school, with a monthly food allowance of 11.5 yuan per person, plus a stipend: 3 yuan for specialized courses and 2.5 yuan for preparatory courses. Textbooks and stationery are provided by the school, and those with special difficulties can also apply for subsidies. After receiving education on the Marxist-Leninist view of nationalities, students deeply understand that the Party's nationality policy, the unity of the motherland, and the unity of all nationalities are in the fundamental interests of all nationalities. In recent years, students who have graduated and left school to participate in socialist construction have played an important role in the progress of all nationalities, national regional autonomy, and democratic reforms. The love and support of the people of all ethnic groups for the Party and Chairman Mao is deepening day by day, and they sing songs everywhere such as "Chairman Mao is the sun" and "The Communist Party is the savior." The former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary elements violated their faith and launched a rebellion, which was immediately defeated and aroused unanimous condemnation from the entire Tibetan monks and lay people and people of all ethnic groups. This is a very natural result. The rebels and their backstage bosses have misjudged the situation, and they will only fail—forever!

Unexpectedly, a small group of rebels fled to India, and with the support of imperialism and foreign reactionaries, and with the assistance of the Indian authorities who claim to maintain Sino-Indian friendship, published the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama." This statement talked at length about Tibetan independence and arbitrarily attacked the Chinese government. This is an extremely serious incident in international life and cannot but arouse the unparalleled anger of the entire Chinese people. This time, on the forum of the National People's Congress, the highest organ of power in our country, representatives of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all different religious beliefs unanimously exposed the falsehood and extreme absurdity of the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama." This is the loud voice of 650 million people. Imperialists and domestic and foreign reactionaries, especially those hot-headed politicians in India, must understand: the Chinese people who have stood up cannot be infringed upon. China's internal affairs brook no interference from anyone. If they are obsessed with their own ways and attempt to continue to interfere in China's internal affairs by using the Tibetan rebellion without being countered, then it is too naive and ridiculous. Be smart! Making a wrong estimate of the situation, failing to assess one's own virtues and abilities, and speaking and acting recklessly will be the most tragic thing for someone with at least a political mind. On April 22, another forged Dalai statement was issued, which only tried to cover up the truth. It seems that Indian expansionists have still not woken up, but the great unity of all ethnic groups in our country can never be undermined.

The relationship between people is not only reflected in the great unity of all nationalities, but also in all aspects of social life. I haven't been back to my hometown for decades. The older generation in my hometown are all dead, and very few people know me. That is to say, there are not many relatives. Unexpectedly, as soon as my feet stepped on my lovely homeland, regardless of whether they knew me or not, men, women, old and young, especially the Party cadres of the county and commune, treated me as if I were a relative, no, even more than a relative.

In addition, on the trains on all railway lines, on the ships on the Yangtze River, in the liaison offices and guest houses of the people's committees of various provinces and cities, male and female service personnel serve anyone as if they were relatives. They truly make you feel the warmth of the motherland's big family. And those service personnel almost forget themselves for you. They only know that they must wholeheartedly contribute everything they have to the Party, to the people, and to the great collective, and they show selfless actions in all the trivial details of life. This is the communist style, the spirit of collectivism, and a new moral realm, which is generally formed among the general working people.

This is the concrete manifestation of the socialist system itself, which makes it possible to continuously resolve contradictions within the people and continuously adjust the relationship between individuals and the collective, thereby fundamentally changing the relationship between people.

To sum up, my impression of this inspection is this:

In the ten years since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have not only built a material world for ourselves economically, which is constantly leaping forward, prosperous and affluent, and where people's lives are constantly improving and continuously improving, but also built a spiritual world for ourselves in terms of the relationship between people, which is united, democratic and harmonious, gradually establishing communist morality, and where everyone's heart is filled with joy and belief.

Fellow deputies! The First Session of the Second National People's Congress is meeting again in the capital. This is a congress of unity and a congress of leap forward. This congress will make greater contributions to the great unity of all ethnic groups in our country and the Great Leap Forward in 1959. Let us unite more closely and leap forward more under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao to welcome our great 10th National Day!

Fellow deputies! The season of spring is beautiful and rich, but the spring in the hearts of the people of our evergreen motherland far exceeds the spring in the seasons.

Finally, I sincerely support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and other reports. The "Government Work Report" is, as all representatives have recognized, "an epic of heroism summarizing our country's comprehensive Great Leap Forward." Let us recite this inspiring epic together! Let the domestic and foreign reactionaries, especially those Indian politicians who sympathize with a small group of Tibetan rebels and are hot-headed, tremble in our recitation!

    制止印度扩张主义分子乱说乱动
    邓初民代表说：叛乱分子及其后台老板把形势估计错了，他们只有失败——永远的失败！主席、各位代表：
    春到人间！春风吹开了百花，吹绿了大地，吹来了一九五九年继续大跃进的喜讯。在这万象更新、鸟啼莺鸣的季节里，人们正在以百倍、千倍、万倍的辛勤，从事忘我的劳动，准备向常春的祖国，向伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席奉献出丰硕的礼品。我就是在这样一种令人振奋的季节里拖着病了十年的身体去到武汉、沙市、新厂（我的故乡）、南京、上海、杭州等地视察的。我走遍了城市、乡村、基建工地、风景区、工厂、矿山、学校、医院、人民公社，学习了不少东西，搜集了很多材料，已用通讯方式陆续向人大常委会作了汇报。现仅概括地说一些印象和感想。
    在伟大的中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，不要说我们已进入了春暖花开的春天，而在这大跃进的年代里，我们的祖国是根本没有冬天的。从而我所看到的，不论是在经济、政治、文化那一条战线，那一个岗位上，人们都没有一分一秒停止过他们的脚步。我看到武钢的第一号高炉流出一炉一炉的铁水，武钢的职工们，今年要完成九座大型厂矿的三十多个立体工程，其中包括比一号高炉更高更大的二号（现已建成）、三号高炉；看到机械工人正在集中力量进攻六大设备；看到江南的小麦、菜花、早秧，绿一片，黄一片的令人眼花缭乱；看到公社的牛群、羊群、猪群、鸡鸭鹅群，健壮肥大；看到积肥备耕、改革农具、准备排灌的战鼓敲个不停；看到各项生产指标沿着红色箭头不断上升；看到和听到红旗优质高产竞赛、争取上北京见毛主席的豪言壮语，震耳欲聋。我在这两个多月的日子里，也好像置身在千军万马的战场上，病躯变成壮汉，恨不得举起双臂，劈开一座山，掬起一江水，始终充满着投入一场剧烈战斗和辛勤劳动所持有的喜悦。
    自然，人们的干劲愈足，跃进愈快，人们的心情也就愈舒畅。城乡歌声遍野，诗画满墙的美丽景象，更使我感到极目河山，春色无边。
    在这春色无边，红旗招展，群情振奋，上下一心的战斗气氛中，人们的心情是舒畅的，人们的生活是民主的。这由于我们在党和毛主席的领导下，建立了既有民主，又有集中，既有自由，又有纪律，既有统一意志，又有心情舒畅生动活泼的政治局面。
    这样就改变了人与人的关系，发挥了人民的积极性、创造性，树立了敢想敢说敢干、实事求是的共产主义风格，体现了各民族的大团结，团结在党和毛主席的周围，形成了各民族、各民主阶层、各民主党派、各人民团体、各宗教信仰不同的民主和睦的统一的大家庭。在我们统一的多民族的祖国大家庭里，共同居住着五十多个兄弟民族，分布在辽阔的各地区。这些兄弟民族，从远古以来就开始在祖国土地上，共同劳动和生产，相互间有着悠久而亲密的经济上的合作和文化上的交流，共同创造了祖国的历史和文化。
    因此，我在武汉特别去参观了中央民族学院分院及其所属文物馆。该院包括僮、瑶、苗、回、侗、黎、土家、高山族等十九个民族，他们亲如手足，受到优待，全体学生由学校发给人民助学金，每人每月膳费十一元五角，加发津贴：专科三元，预科二元五角。课本文具均由学校供给，特别困难的，还可申请补助金。学生经过马列主义民族观的教育，深深懂得党的民族政策，祖国的统一，各民族的团结，是符合各民族的根本利益的。几年来学生毕业离校，参加社会主义建设事业，对于各民族的进步和民族区域自治以及民主改革都起了重要的作用。各族人民对于党和毛主席的爱戴和拥护，日益加深，到处唱出“毛主席是太阳”，“共产党是救星”的颂歌。原西藏地方政府和上层反动分子背信弃义，发动叛乱，立即遭到失败，引起西藏全体僧俗人民及各民族人民一致声讨，这是很自然的结果。叛乱分子及其后台老板把形势估计错了，他们只有失败——永远的失败！
    不料一小撮叛乱分子逃窜到了印度，居然在帝国主义和外国反动派的支持下，在号称维护中印友好关系的印度官方协助下，发表了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这个声明大谈其西藏独立，任意攻击中国政府，这是国际生活中一个极严重的事件，不能不引起全中国人民的无比愤怒，这次在我国最高权力机关的全国人民代表大会的讲坛上，各民族、各民主阶层、各民主党派、各人民团体、各宗教信仰不同的代表，都一致揭穿了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的虚伪性与极端荒谬，这是六亿五千万人民的宏亮声音，帝国主义和国内外反动派，特别是印度那些头脑发热的政治家，必须懂得：站起来了的中国人民是不好侵犯的。中国的内政绝不容许任何人横加干涉，如果执迷不悟，企图利用西藏叛乱继续干涉中国内政而不遭到回击，那就太幼稚可笑了。还是放聪明些吧！把形势估计错误，不度德，不量力，乱说乱动，对于一个起码具有政治头脑的人来说，将是最可悲的。四月二十二日又伪造了一个达赖声明，只是欲盖弥彰，看起来，印度扩张主义分子仍然没有清醒过来，但我国各民族的大团结是永远不可能被破坏的。
    人与人的关系，不仅表现在各民族的大团结方面，而且表现在社会生活的各方面。我几十年没有回过老家，家乡老一辈的死光了，认识我的人很少了。也就是说亲人不多了。不料两只脚一踏上我可爱的乡土，不论识与不识，男女老少，特别是党的县社干部，都把我当着亲人一般，不，比亲人还亲。
    此外，在各铁路线的火车上，在长江的轮船上，在各省市人委会的交际处、招待所，男女服务员都是把任何人当着亲人服侍的。真正使你感到祖国大家庭的温暖。而那些服务员为着你，几乎把自己忘掉了。他们只知道要全心全意地向党、向人民、向伟大的集体，贡献出自己的一切，而在一切生活的细微末节中都表现出忘我的行动。这是共产主义的风格，集体主义的精神，新的道德境界，普遍地在一般劳动人民中形成起来的具体表现。
    这是社会主义制度本身，有可能不断解决人民内部矛盾，不断调整个人和集体的关系，从而使人与人之间的关系起了根本变化的具体表现。
    总结起来说，我这次视察的印象，就是这样：
    建国十年来在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，不仅已为我们在经济上构筑了一个不断跃进、繁荣富庶、人民生活日益改善和不断提高的物质世界，同时，也为我们在人与人的关系上构筑了一个全民团结、民主和睦，逐步树立共产主义道德，每一个人的心里都充满了愉快和信念的精神世界。
    各位代表！第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议又在首都开会了，这是一次团结的大会，跃进的大会，这次大会对我国各民族的大团结和一九五九年的大跃进，将作出更大的贡献。让我们在党和毛主席的领导下更加团结，更为跃进，来迎接我们伟大的国庆十周年！
    各位代表！春暖花开的季节是浓郁美好的，但我们常春的祖国的人们心里的春天，是远远超过季节上的春天的。
    最后我竭诚拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和其他各项报告。“政府工作报告”诚如各代表所公认是：“总结我国全面大跃进的英雄史诗”。让我们齐声朗诵这首振奋人心的史诗吧！让国内外反动派、特别是那些同情一小撮西藏叛乱分子，头脑发热的印度政治家们在我们的朗诵声中发抖吧！
