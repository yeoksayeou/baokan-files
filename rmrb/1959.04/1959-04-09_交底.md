Explanation

		Shāo Zhōu

To explain the task to the broad masses of workers, to explain the significance of completing the task, to explain the favorable and difficult conditions for completing the task, to explain the methods for overcoming difficulties and the measures for completing the task, etc., to explain both the existing assets and the assets to be invested. Explaining, is the application of the Party's mass line in industrial enterprise production.

The clearer the explanation, the brighter the masses' hearts, the clearer the direction, the more energetic they are to work, and the better the work results will be. The successful completion of production plans is related to this word "explanation." This is an important part of our rich experience in carrying out mass movements. Explaining, is being consciously and skillfully used by the vast majority of enterprise management cadres. However, there are also some comrades who are not good at explaining in their work, or who fail to fully explain when the work is urgent. In addition to the need to improve their leadership skills, the more important reason is that they underestimate the strength and wisdom of the broad masses of workers and emphasize the contradiction between tasks and the masses' awareness.

Only in a socialist country where the working masses are the masters of the enterprise can the trend of explaining flourish; only when workers understand the situation can they manage the household well. If they are the masters of the enterprise, is there nothing to explain? The answer is no! Because the division of labor of each worker is different, their understanding of the assets and their plans for "getting rich" will inevitably have certain limitations. When workers understand the situation and manage the household, they will know the cost of living, and their sense of responsibility as masters will inevitably increase. Explaining, is not only a method of realizing economic plans, but also an important political task.

Explaining is not pushing away and ignoring. The explanation itself is not laissez-faire, but the embodiment of the Party's leadership. It embodies both the ideological method of Marxism-Leninism and the working method of the mass line. The process and result of explaining will inevitably be the process of advanced ideas overcoming conservative ideas. A good explanation will bring about the development of production, the leap forward of work, and the improvement of ideology.

Explaining must be thorough. Economic indicators, production measures, and ideological work, if they cannot be implemented, may fall through. Therefore, the method of implementing them layer by layer, and carrying them out to the end, should be greatly promoted. For every task of the revolutionary cause, thoroughness is always the highest and best standard of work.

The situation is also constantly changing. This month's assets are thicker than last month's assets; the investment required is also higher than last month's requirements. Therefore, the situation must be explained frequently.

    交底
    梢舟
    向广大职工交任务，交完成任务的意义，交完成任务的有利条件和困难条件，交克服困难的办法和完成任务的措施等等，既交现有的家底，也交要垫的家底。交底，是党的群众路线在工业企业生产上的运用。
    底交得越清，群众心里越亮，奔头越明确，干起来越有劲，工作效果也就会越好。生产计划完成的好，都和这个交字有关。这是我们大搞群众运动的丰富经验中的重要一条。交底，在我们绝大部分的企业管理干部中，都在自觉地、熟练地运用着。但是，也还有的同志，在工作中不善于交底，或工作紧迫时交不到底。这除了在领导艺术上尚待提高以外，更重要的原因是对广大职工的力量和智慧估计不足，强调任务与群众觉悟的矛盾。
    只有职工群众是企业主人的社会主义国家，交底之风才能大兴；职工才能摸清家底当好家。既是企业的主人，是否就无交底之可说？答曰：否！因为每一个职工工作分工之不同，对家底的了解和“发家”的计划，不可能不有其一定的局限性。职工摸清了家底，当家方知柴米贵，主人翁的责任感，也必然增强。交底，不光是一个实现经济计划的方法，也是一项重要的政治工作。
    交，不是一推不管。交的本身不是放任自流，而是党的领导作用的体现。它既体现着马列主义的思想方法，也体现着群众路线的工作方法。交的过程和结果，又必然是先进思想克服保守思想的过程。交得好，就会带来生产的发展、工作的跃进和思想的提高。
    交底要交到底。经济指标也好，生产措施也好，思想工作也好，落不了实，就可能落空。所以层层贯彻，一杆子插到底的方法，应该大大提倡。对革命事业的每一项工作来说，彻底，什么时候也是工作的最高和最好的标准。
    底，也是不断变化的，这个月的家底，就比上个月的家底厚；要垫的底，也比上个月要求的高。所以，底要经常地交。
