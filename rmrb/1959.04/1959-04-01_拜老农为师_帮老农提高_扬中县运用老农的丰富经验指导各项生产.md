Yangzhong, Jiangsu, March 31st (from our newspaper) – Cadres at all levels in Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, are giving full play to the role of experienced farmers in leading the agricultural production movement. In the current spring planting preparation work, experienced farmers have played a very important guiding role in seed selection, germination, and leveling rice seedling fields. Recently, the county selected more than 300 skilled planters from among experienced farmers to participate in spring planting.

Learning from experienced farmers in production has become a common practice in Yangzhong County. Zhu Weizhong, the county party secretary, formally took Huang Meishan, an old model of agricultural production in Yangzhong County, as his teacher at a meeting of more than 2,000 people. They often worked and studied agricultural production issues together in the process of conducting wheat and rice experimental fields last year. Zhu Weizhong learned a lot of valuable experience from Huang Meishan, and also learned many technical farming skills. This spring, the wheat in Yangzhong County was affected by the excessive river mud applied in winter, which affected the wheat's "rising." Zhu Weizhong immediately went to consult his master. Huang Meishan told him: "In winter, soil fertilizer is the 'home' of wheat, protecting it from wind and rain; in spring, too much soil will become the 'shackles' of wheat, so you must smash or remove these clods." After they discussed specific methods, they immediately mobilized the masses to carefully crush the clods, and in places with too much mud, they removed the mud by hand, so that the wheat that had been pressed down smoothly passed the greening stage.

Responsible cadres of the Yangzhong County Party Committee, young people among the cadres of various communes, brigades, and production teams, and those who are not familiar with agricultural production, generally take experienced farmers as teachers and invite experienced farmers to be consultants. In the middle of discussing agricultural production technical issues, the county party committee never easily draws conclusions when there are different opinions, but instead goes separately to study with their masters. Everyone brings the opinions of the experienced farmers to the meeting for further discussion, and then makes a decision. When the agricultural departments formulate technical operating procedures for various crops, they generally hold forums for experienced farmers to widely solicit their opinions; after analysis and improvement, they formulate various technical requirements that are in line with local conditions.

In the movement to strive for a yield of 1,000 kilograms of wheat per mu, cadres at all levels in Yangzhong County paid special attention to giving play to the role of experienced farmers. At every stage of wheat development, they studied specific measures with experienced farmers as early as possible. At a forum to study how to get through the greening stage, experienced farmers Huang Meishan, Zhang Youde, and others especially raised the issue of preventing spring cold and spring frost, and suggested establishing smoke kilns in the northwest corner of the wheat fields, and using rice roots to burn soil to create smoke when necessary. This can not only prevent cold and frost, but also smoke the soil to create fertilizer, and also dig out the old nests of diseases and insects, killing three birds with one stone. The leadership adopted this suggestion, and this kind of smoke kiln was generally established throughout the county, with very good results. Experienced farmers Wei Chengming, Liu Jifu, and others analyzed the situation that the weather was not cold last winter, the wheat seedlings were denser than in previous years, and it was conducive to the occurrence of diseases and insect pests, and proposed to do all the preparations for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests as early as possible, so as to achieve "early treatment, small treatment, and complete treatment." According to this opinion, the agricultural department opened technical training classes for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in late February, repaired and added sprayers, and actively collected and manufactured indigenous pesticides.

As soon as the wheat turned green, cadres at all levels held forums at each level to discuss what to do when the wheat passed the jointing stage. County Magistrate Liu Guosheng talked with several experienced farmers in the Xingfu Brigade of the Baqiao Commune. Shi Luhe, who was sixty years old, said: Smoking the soil kiln cannot be stopped overnight, and grinding snails cannot be stopped for a moment. When the wheat is jointing, it needs to grow stalks and ears, so it depends on these two kinds of fertilizer. Be sure to sift the ash fertilizer carefully, and do not break the wheat. Liao Yongnian, who was sixty-seven years old, said: "Stop weeding at Qingming, and stop watering at Guyu." This year, the wheat is developing early, and fertilization should also be advanced, so we need to come up with a blitz. The county magistrate listened carefully to their opinions, and also asked the experienced farmers about some topdressing methods and the problems that might be encountered in topdressing. The county party committee and the party committees of various communes concentrated the opinions of the experienced farmers and proposed that during the jointing period, the main attack direction was to accumulate and create large amounts of phosphate and potash fertilizers, apply them to the fields according to the seedlings, and promote strong wheat stalks, large ears, and full grains.

Experienced farmers are also good doctors for various crops. When natural disasters occur, or when abnormal phenomena occur in the growth of crops, cadres at all levels rushed to invite experienced farmers to "consult," find the root cause of the disease, and immediately take effective measures. During the wintering period of wheat this year, the wheat seedlings generally turned yellow. Some communes thought that the wheat was sick and sent the wheat seedlings to the county for identification. However, no bacteria were found, and the cause could not be found for a while. The cadres immediately dispatched to the countryside to hold forums for experienced farmers to conduct "field consultations." As a result, three major causes were found: the first situation was that the soil layers were disrupted during deep plowing; the second situation was that the weather was dry and fertilizers were not easy to decompose, and some fields still lacked fertilizer; the third situation was that some fields were too rotten when sown after rain, and then the weather dried up, the land became hardened and not easy to ventilate. After the causes were found, the experience of the experienced farmers was concentrated, and various measures such as topdressing, drought resistance, and loosening the soil were taken separately. Ten days later, all the yellowed wheat seedlings turned green, reversing the abnormal wheat growth at that time.

Yangzhong County not only attaches importance to giving play to the role of experienced farmers in production, but also attaches great importance to cultivating experienced farmers. The county's science and technology conferences and conferences for deploying and studying agricultural production tasks are all invited to participate by experienced farmers. Popular science and technology reading materials on agriculture are often printed and distributed to experienced farmers to read, and they are absorbed to participate in various science and technology training classes, so that they have the opportunity to learn new scientific knowledge. At the same time, the county party committee also focuses on cultivating some experienced farmers. As early as 1953, the county sent a technical cadre and labor model Huang Meishan to work together, and through production practice, helped him sort out and summarize the experience of cultivating rice and wheat, and also assigned a special person to help him learn culture. The agricultural technology promotion station also takes summarizing and improving the production experience of experienced farmers as one of its main tasks.

Under the cultivation and education of the Party, many experienced and ideologically progressive old farmers have been admitted to the Party and elected as cadres of communes, brigades, and production teams. In the process of implementing the garden-style management of wheat fields, Yangzhong County, due to its emphasis on cultivating and relying on experienced farmers, made examples at all levels, ensuring that there were no deviations from top to bottom and that the quality of all parts of the county was very high, winning the red flag of the entire special zone.

    拜老农为师　帮老农提高
    扬中县运用老农的丰富经验指导各项生产
    本报扬中31日电　江苏省扬中县各级干部在领导农业生产运动中，充分发挥老农作用。在目前春播准备工作中，老农在选种、催芽、平整秧田等方面都起了很重要的指导作用。最近，全县在老农中选出三百多个播种能手，参加春播工作。
    生产上以老农为师，在扬中县已形成一种风气。县委书记朱维中在二千多人的大会上，正式拜老农黄美善为师。黄美善是扬中县农业生产老模范。他们在去年一同搞麦子和水稻试验田的过程中，经常在一起劳动，在一起研究农业生产上的问题。朱维中向黄美善学到了许多宝贵的经验，很多技术性农活也学会了。今春，扬中县麦子由于冬季河泥压得多，影响麦子“起身”。朱维中马上去请教师傅。黄美善告诉他：“冬天，土肥是麦的‘家’，起风落雨要它遮；春天，过多的土就会变成麦的‘枷’了，一定要把这些土块敲碎或者搬掉。”他们商量出具体办法以后，马上发动群众精细地打碎土块，泥多的地方就用手把泥搬掉，使压倒的麦子顺利地过了返青关。
    扬中县委的负责干部，各公社、大队、生产队干部中的年青人，和对农业生产不熟悉的人，普遍拜老农为师，请老农当参谋。县委在讨论农业生产技术问题中间有了不同意见，从不轻易做出结论，而是分头去和师傅研究。大家把老农的意见带到会上再展开讨论，然后做出决定。农业部门在制定各项作物的技术操作规程的时候，普遍召开老农座谈会，广泛征求老农意见；经过分析提高，拟订出切合当地情况的各项技术要求。
    在争取麦子亩产千斤的丰产运动中，扬中县各级干部特别重视发挥老农的作用。在麦子的每一个发育阶段，都及早地和老农研究具体措施。在一次研究如何过好返青关的座谈会上，老农黄美善、张耰德等人特别提出防春寒、春冻的问题，建议在麦田的西北角建立熏土窑，必要时可用稻根烧土熏烟。这既可以防寒防冻，又可以熏土造肥，还可以挖掉病虫的老窝，一举三得。领导方面采纳了这个意见，全县普遍建立了这种熏土窑，效果很好。老农韦成明、刘纪福等分析了去冬天气不冷、麦苗比往年密、有利于病虫害发生的情况，提出要及早做好防治病虫害的一切准备，做到“治早、治小、治了”。农业部门根据这个意见，提前在2月下旬就开办了防治病虫害的技术训练班，修理和添置了喷雾器，并积极搜集和制造土农药。
    麦子刚刚返青，各级干部又层层召开座谈会，商量下一步麦子过拔节关的时候该做些什么。县长刘国生在八桥公社幸福大队找了几个老农谈心。六十岁的施掳和说：烧熏土一夜不能歇，磨螺蛳一刻不能停。麦子拔节的时候，要长秆长穗，就要靠这两种肥。下灰肥千万要筛细，不能压断麦子。六十七岁的廖永年说：“清明断薅，谷雨断浇”，今年麦子发得早，下肥还要提前，要来个突击。县长仔细地倾听他们的意见，还提出一些追肥方法和在追肥中可能碰到的问题向老农请教。县委和各公社党委集中了老农的意见，提出在拔节期间，主攻方向是大积大造磷钾肥，分类看苗施下田，促使麦秆粗壮，穗大粒饱。
    经验丰富的老农，也是各种农作物的良医。当自然灾害发生的时候，或者是庄稼的生长发生了不正常现象的时候，各级干部就纷纷请老农“会诊”，找出病根，立即采取有效措施。今年麦子越冬期间，麦苗普遍发黄。有些公社以为是麦子生病了，把麦苗送到县里鉴定。但没有查出病菌，一时又找不出原因。干部们马上四乡出动，召开老农座谈会，进行“田头会诊”。结果，找出了三大病因：第一种情况是深翻时翻乱了土层；第二种情况是天气干旱，肥料不易分解，有些田肥料还不足；第三种情况是部分雨后播种的田太烂，后来天一干，土地板结，不易通气。病因找出后，又集中了老农的经验，分别采取追肥、抗旱、松土等各种措施。十天后，发黄的麦苗全部转青，扭转了当时麦子生长不正常的现象。
    扬中县不但重视发挥老农在生产上的作用，同时也很重视培养老农。县里的科学技术会议、布置和研究农业生产任务的会议，都邀请老农参加。经常印发农业科学技术通俗读物给老农阅读，吸收他们参加各种科学技术训练班，让他们有机会学习新的科学知识。同时，县委还有重点地培养一些经验丰富的老农。早在1953年，县里就派了一个技术干部和劳动模范黄美善在一起劳动，通过生产实践，帮助他整理总结栽培水稻和麦子的经验，还固定专人帮他学文化。农业技术推广站也都把总结提高老农的生产经验作为主要任务之一。
    在党的培养教育下，很多经验丰富、思想进步的老农已被吸收入党，并被选为公社、大队和生产队的干部。在实行麦子田间管理园田化的过程中，扬中县由于重视培养老农，依靠老农，层层做样子，做到了从上到下不走样，全县各地的质量都很高，夺得了全专区的红旗。
