　　Carry Forward and Enhance
　　Li Jiuzhe
　　More than 1,000 cadres from the Fuzhou Special District of Jiangxi Province, after returning from working as commune members, have been using their experiences to further improve their leadership methods and work styles. They have adopted several methods to strengthen regular contact with the masses, maintain regular contact with the masses, so that the opinions and demands of the broad masses can be promptly reflected to the leading organs. This is a very gratifying phenomenon and a very valuable practice.
　　One of the purposes of cadres participating in physical labor is to improve leadership methods and work styles, thereby better leading the masses in socialist construction. Therefore, it requires cadres sent to lower levels to take participation in physical labor for a certain period as a starting point, constantly improve their work style, and continuously strengthen contact with the masses. It is obviously wrong to regard participating in physical labor as a simple "task" and hold an attitude of "returning to camp upon completion and everything will be fine." The commendable aspect of the cadres sent to lower levels in Fuzhou Special District lies in the fact that after returning to their work posts, they immediately applied the experiences gained during their time at the lower levels to their work, carrying forward and enhancing the achievements, transforming from "five-good" commune members to "five-good" cadres.
　　The main experiences used by cadres sent to lower levels in Fuzhou Special District are two: one is to maintain direct contact with commune members, and the other is to go deep into the masses "from top to bottom."
　　Some cadres have established "base households" and "friend households" in the communes where they worked, while others have established regular meeting and communication systems with production teams or commune members. They maintained direct contact with the masses or production teams, understood the situation, listened to the opinions of the masses, exchanged work opinions and experiences with the production teams, and helped the production teams to discover and solve problems in a timely manner and improve production work. These methods of direct contact with the masses can be promoted. If thousands upon thousands of cadres across the country, through participating in physical labor for a certain period, establish direct contact with several commune member households or several production teams, what a huge number of masses and production teams the cadres at all levels will maintain direct contact with!
　　As for "from top to bottom," it is also a new method of going deep into the masses adopted by some cadres after having a deep understanding while working as commune members. For example, Shi Zhenzong, Deputy Secretary of the Nancheng County Party Committee, before working as a commune member, although he had selected his own work base commune, his work often only remained at the commune Party committee meetings; and he only had contact with cadres at this level, rarely going deep into production teams, production groups, and commune member families, so he rarely heard opinions directly from the commune members, could not fully understand the situation, and therefore, his work arrangements sometimes could not be in line with reality. After working as a commune member, he changed his working methods. Now, when he arranges work, he first goes deep into the production teams, production groups, and commune members to conduct investigations and research, and then repeatedly studies and arranges the work with the commune cadres. In this way, the work he arranges can be in line with reality, and it can be carried out more smoothly. Adopting this method of "from top to bottom" makes the work progress faster, the enthusiasm of the masses is high, and a new high tide of production is surging.
　　The methods of contacting the masses and going deep into reality adopted by cadres sent to lower levels in Fuzhou Special District after returning to their work posts are in line with the working methods of the mass line repeatedly told to us by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. They can truly listen to the opinions of the masses from various aspects and discuss with the masses more, so they can discover and solve problems in a timely manner, powerfully promote the current great production movement, and specifically embody the principle of "from the masses, to the masses." This method should be carried forward and enhanced.

　　发扬光大
　　李久泽
    江西抚州专区一千多名干部下放当社员回来之后，运用在当社员期间的体会和经验，进一步改进领导方法和工作作风。他们采取若干方法，加强与群众的经常联系，保持与群众的经常接触，使广大群众的意见和要求能够及时地反映到领导机关来。这是一个十分可喜的现象，是一种十分可贵的作法。
    干部参加体力劳动的目的之一，是改进领导方法，改进工作作风，从而更好地领导群众进行社会主义建设。因此，它要求下放干部以参加一定时期的体力劳动为起点，不断地改进自己的工作作风，不断地加强与群众的联系。那种把当社员参加体力劳动看作是一个单纯的“任务”，持“期满回营、万事大吉”的态度，显然是不对的。抚州专区下放干部的可贵之处，就在于他们当完社员回到工作岗位之后，立即把下放期间的体会和经验运用到工作中去，把取得的成绩发扬光大，从“五好”社员成为“五好”干部。
    抚州专区下放干部运用的体会和经验主要有两条：一是保持与社员群众的直接联系，一是“一竿子到底”地深入群众。
    一部分干部在自己劳动过的公社中建立“基点户”，“朋友户”，另一部分干部则与生产队或社员建立定期会面、通信等联系制度。他们同群众或生产队保持了直接联系，了解情况，听取群众意见，同生产队交换工作意见和经验，帮助生产队及时发现问题、解决问题，搞好生产工作。这些直接同群众联系的办法，都是可以推广的。如果全国成千上万的干部，通过参加一定时期的体力劳动，都与几户社员或几个生产队建立了直接的联系，那么，各级干部保持直接联系的群众和生产队将是多么大的一个数字啊！
    至于“一竿子到底”，也是一部分干部在当社员时有了深切体会后所采取的深入群众的一种新方法。例如：南城县委副书记石振宗，在当社员以前，虽然选定有自己的工作基点社，但他的工作往往只停留在公社党委会议上；并只同这一级的干部有联系，很少深入到生产队、生产小组、社员家庭里去，以致很少听到直接来自社员群众的意见，不能全面了解情况，所以，布置工作有时就不能切合实际。经过当社员以后，就改变了自己的工作方法。现在，他在每次布置工作的时候，首先深入到生产队、生产小组和社员中去，进行调查研究，然后再和公社干部反复研究，进行布置。这样，他所布置的工作就能够切合实际，进行起来也较顺利。采取这种“一竿子到底”的方法，就使工作进展较快，群众干劲十足，生产新高潮汹涌澎湃。
    抚州专区下放干部回到工作岗位后所采取的联系群众、深入实际的作法，是符合于党中央和毛泽东同志屡次告诉我们的群众路线的工作方法。他们既能够真正多方听取群众意见，多同群众商量，就能够及时发现问题，解决问题，有力地推进了当前的大生产运动，也就具体地体现了从群众中来、到群众中去。这种方法，应当发扬光大。
