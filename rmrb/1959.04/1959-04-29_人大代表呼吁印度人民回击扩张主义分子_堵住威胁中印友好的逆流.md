Xinhua News Agency, April 28th. During the general assembly discussion at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress this morning, many deputies continued to denounce the words and deeds of Indian expansionists in interfering in China's internal affairs. Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, said: A small handful of expansionists in India and certain Indian politicians, fearing that the world is not chaotic enough, resort to means such as fabricating rumors, slandering, and distorting historical facts to agitate people's minds. According to them, it is not the imperialists and their echoers who are interfering in China's internal affairs, but China is interfering in India's internal affairs. This is a complete reversal of black and white, and extremely shameless. Their voices are already identical or indistinguishable from "Voice of America." This is a countercurrent that is currently threatening the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indian peoples, and it deserves serious vigilance from Indian friends and the Indian people. He said that the people of China and India are rising to repel the provocations of imperialist interferers and their echoers, fighting to defend the great tradition of friendship and the "Panchsheel," and to consolidate Asian peace and security and the friendly relations of the people of all countries. This struggle will surely be victorious. Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Education, said that our government cherishes the friendly relations between China and India very much, but these friendly relations are now being undermined by Indian expansionists. All imperialists and reactionaries should be clear: The six hundred million Chinese people who have stood up will never tolerate others interfering in China's internal affairs and undermining China's territorial integrity. Ma Yinchu, Zhu Kezhen, Shao Lizi, Bei Shizhang, Xu Baoju, Gu Gongxu, Zhao Zhongyao, Liu Kaiqu, Dong Yimao, Pan Tianshou, Lu Shijia, Yan Jingyao, Tang Xunze, Feng Binfu, Yu Pingbo, Ye Xichun, Yu Zuochen, Ni Feijun, Tong Dizhou, Cai Banghua, Xu Chiwen and twenty-one other representatives pointed out in a joint statement that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become increasingly popular among the people of Asia and Africa and have increasingly strong vitality. Whoever caters to the wishes of imperialism and abandons the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will be abandoned by the people of Asia and Africa and will not have a good end. The Chinese people have always been faithful to the Five Principles and have always strived tirelessly to defend them. Zha Xi Wangxu, a Tibetan representative from Qinghai Province, said that it will be a serious choice for certain politicians in India to be friends with the six hundred million Chinese people or to be friends with a small handful of Tibetan reactionaries who are spurned by the Chinese people. He said that our people are friendly to the Indian people; in the past, present and future, we will do our best to maintain and consolidate this friendly relationship, which is beneficial to the people of China and India and to maintaining world peace.

Many people's representatives from the industrial front emphasized in the general assembly discussion this morning the important significance of launching the movement to increase production and practice economy in realizing this year's national economic plan. Wang Shoudao, Minister of Communications, pointed out in his speech that this year's great leap forward plan for the national economy, centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, has set glorious and arduous tasks for the transportation sector. After vigorously launching mass movements and vigorously carrying out technological revolutions, transportation departments across the country have already achieved great results in the first quarter. Since entering the second quarter, all employees have launched a red flag competition movement for increasing production and practicing economy, centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. This movement requires multi-pulling, multi-loading, fast loading and unloading, accelerating the turnover of transportation vehicles, improving labor productivity, increasing transportation capacity, and reducing transportation costs under the premise of ensuring safety and improving quality, and doing everything possible to tap transportation potential in order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in the national economy. Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in his speech that Shanghai's total industrial output value in 1959 is expected to increase by about 45% compared with the previous year, which is equivalent to more than four times the total industrial output value in 1952. The most important method to achieve this plan is to launch a large-scale mass movement to increase production and practice economy, so that Shanghai's industrial labor productivity will increase by 40% or more this year without increasing the number of workers. Cao Diqiu emphasized that the primary link in fully mobilizing the masses in factories and enterprises is to continue to carry forward the spirit of rectification, continue to implement putting politics in command, continue to adhere to the appearance of leading cadres as ordinary workers, and always maintain the democratic style of consulting with the masses on everything. Chen Jingsha, Vice Governor of Hubei Province, Song Yiping, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Tang Wuyuan, Vice Mayor of Wuhan, and Zhu Zaodi, Li Dongqing, Peng Yangqin, Yang Dezhong, Bao Ding and other representatives introduced the situation of the vast number of employees in Wuhan City launching the movement to increase production and practice economy since this year in a joint speech.

Also speaking at the general assembly this morning were National People's Congress representatives Jin Shuliang, Wazhamuji, Yang Fuqing, Zhang Tianfang, Maimaitihawuli, Lou Erkang, Su Guangming, Ling Daqi, Cheng Shengsan, Zhang Yan, Li Tingshun, Zhu Dehai, Jin Baishan, Jin Shilong, Yu Guanghan, Jin Xinshu, Zhang Xiruo, Zhou Shutao, Rong Gaotang, Li Bozhao, Liu Peizhi, Yue Weifan, Guo Menghe, Jiang Cisheng, Gao Jianjun, Renqin Zhamusu, Zhang Shouyin, Mao Henian, Zhu Xianyi, Yu Aifeng, Fei Guangtai, Pang Guanxiang, Chen Yuan, Chen Li, Liu Huimin, Hong Shunli, Wang Yanan, Feng Yuanjun, Dai Yucai, Meng Qingyuan, Zhang Xi, Zhu Xi, Chen Yousheng, Li Chengzhi, Liu Tonggao, Feng Yunhe, Cai Banghua, Xie Fumin, Hou Debang, Yang Xiandong, He Guiyan, Yuan Huizhuo, Peng Chong, Wang Meigong, Xia Jianbai, Ye Xichun, Li Kezuo, Wang Yusheng, Sun Dehe, Liu Fei, Xu Shigao, Lei Rongke, Li Siguang, Mao Yisheng, Ding Ying, Huang Jiashe, Liu Chengzhao, Du Guoxiang, Yan Jici, Zhou Peiyuan, Xia Kangnong, Lin Yuechuan, Chen Side, Shao Liangchu, Ding Lide, Wang Shenlin, Liu Minsheng, Liu Xianzhi, Lin Zun, Xia Nai, Chen Lei, Zhang Gongzhi, Zhou Ren, Xu Zuoxia, Xu Meisheng, Guo Yonghuai, Zhang Hanying, Guo Yicheng, Jin Baozhen, Bi Dexian, Guo Dihuo, Deng Wenzhao, Huang Jie, Chen Qiuan, Xie Nanguang, Chen Zongji, Wu Yixiu, Wu Huanxing, Liu Simu, Su Buqing, Chen Wangdao, Chen Jianggong, Wu Ruoan, Jin Zhonghua, Zhao Chaogou, Shu Xincheng, Liao Shicheng and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhu Yuanding, Zhu Shuping, Zhao Dexian, Cui Cai, and Fan Changjiang.

    人大代表呼吁印度人民回击扩张主义分子
    堵住威胁中印友好的逆流
    新华社28日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议今天上午举行的大会讨论中，许多代表继续斥责印度扩张主义分子干涉中国内政的言行。中印友好协会会长丁西林代表说：印度一小撮扩张主义分子和某些印度的政治家惟恐天下不乱，不惜用造谣、污蔑和歪曲历史事实等手段来煽惑人心。按照他们的说法，好像不是帝国主义者及其应声虫在干涉中国的内政，而是中国在干涉印度内政似的。这真是颠倒黑白，无耻已极。他们的声音已经和“美国之音”异曲同工或者毫无二致。这是目前威胁到中印两国人民友好关系的一股逆流，值得印度朋友们和印度人民严重警惕的。他说，中印两国人民正在奋起回击帝国主义干涉者及其应声虫的挑衅，为保卫伟大的友谊传统和“潘查希拉”，为巩固亚洲和平安全和各国人民的友好关系进行斗争，这个斗争一定会得到胜利。教育部部长杨秀峰代表说，我国政府十分珍视中印两国的友好关系，但是，这种友好关系现在正受着来自印度扩张主义分子的破坏。一切帝国主义者和反动派应该清楚：站起来的中国六亿人民决不容忍他人干涉中国内政、破坏中国领土的完整。马寅初竺可桢、邵力子、贝时璋、许宝驹、顾功叙、赵忠尧、刘开渠、董聿茂、潘天寿、陆士嘉、严景耀、唐巽泽、冯宾符、俞平伯、叶熙春、俞佐宸、倪斐君、童第周、蔡邦华、徐赤文等二十一位代表在联合发言中指出，和平共处五项原则已经在亚非人民中越来越深入人心，具有越来越强大的生命力，谁要迎合帝国主义的意旨，背弃和平共处的五项原则，谁就会遭到亚非人民的唾弃，不会有什么好的下场。中国人民一贯忠实于五项原则，并始终为捍卫五项原则而不懈奋斗。青海省藏族代表札喜旺徐说，同六亿中国人民为友，还是同坚持与中国人民唾弃的一小撮西藏反动派为友，这对印度的某些政治家将是一个严重的抉择。他说，我国人民同印度人民是友好的；过去现在和将来我们都将竭力维护和巩固这种友好的关系，这是有利于中印两国人民和维护世界和平利益的。
    来自工业战线的许多人民代表，在今天上午的大会讨论中，着重谈到开展增产节约运动对实现今年国民经济计划的重要意义。交通部部长王首道代表在发言中指出，今年，以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国民经济大跃进计划，为交通运输部门提出了光荣而艰巨的任务。全国各地交通运输部门，经过大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，在第一季度已经取得了很大成绩。进入第二季度以来，全体职工又开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约红旗竞赛运动。这个运动要求在保证安全和提高质量的前提下，多拉多载、快装快卸，加速运输工具周转，提高劳动生产率，增加运输能力，降低运输成本，千方百计地挖掘运输潜力，以适应国民经济大跃进的需要。中共上海市委书记处书记曹荻秋代表在发言中指出，1959年上海工业总产值预计比上年增长45％左右，相当于1952年工业总产值的四倍多。实现这个计划，最主要的方法是开展一个规模巨大的增产节约的群众运动，在不增加工人的条件下，使今年上海工业劳动生产率比去年增长40％或者更多一些。曹荻秋着重指出，在工厂企业中，充分发动群众的首要环节，是继续发扬整风的精神，继续贯彻政治挂帅，继续坚持领导干部以普通劳动者的姿态出现，永远保持遇事同群众商量的民主作风。湖北省副省长陈经畬代表、中共武汉市委书记处书记宋一平代表、武汉市副市长唐午园代表和朱早弟、李冬青、彭仰钦、杨德重、鲍鼎等代表在联合发言中介绍了今年以来武汉市广大职工开展增产节约运动的情况。
