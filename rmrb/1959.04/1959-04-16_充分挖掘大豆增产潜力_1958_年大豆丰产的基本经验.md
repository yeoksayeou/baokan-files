　　Fully Exploiting the Potential for Increased Soybean Production
　　-- Basic Experiences in High-Yield Soybean Production in 1958 --
　　Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

    In 1958, China's soybean production experienced a leap forward, with the national average yield per mu reaching approximately 170 jin, representing 161.8% of the 1957 figure. Numerous new records of large-scale high-yield and exceptionally high-yield production emerged across the country.

    Production practice has demonstrated that changing from no-tillage to tillage or deep plowing, from no fertilization to fertilization, and from sparse planting to rational close planting are the main keys to increasing soybean production. Although the national soybean yield per unit area in 1958 increased by about 61.8% compared to 1957, it still lagged far behind the growth rate of crops such as grain and cotton. Judging from high-yield examples in various regions, the potential for increased soybean production is still significant. Through analyzing high-yield soybean cultivation materials and investigation results, we have summarized the 1958 soybean high-yield experiences and put forward suggestions for high-yield soybean cultivation technical measures in 1959.

    Deep Plowing is the Foundation for Increased Production

    Deep plowing is the foundation for increasing soybean production. Soybeans are deep-rooted crops; under good cultivation conditions, the main root penetrates deep into the soil. Conversely, the main root is underdeveloped, and most of the lateral roots are confined to the topsoil.

    According to the comparison results from Xiangzhou Village, Zhucheng County, Shandong Province in 1958, tilled land yielded 15%-20% more than untilled land. Materials from the 1958 Hunan Province soybean on-site meeting showed that the number of root nodules per plant on tilled land was 42 more than on untilled land. In 1958, our institute conducted a tillage comparison at a key point in Shouzhang County, and the tilled land had more grains per plant, longer main roots, higher yields, and did not lodge, while the untilled land showed lodging. Deep plowing not only makes plants robust and tall, with more nodes and branches, and increases the yield per plant and per unit area, but also allows the main root to develop in depth, which strengthens the plant's stability and creates conditions for close planting. This negates the erroneous views such as "no need to plow the land for soybeans" and "uneven emergence from plowing, better to leave ridges." As for the plowing depth for large-scale high-yield soybean cultivation, it should be determined according to local conditions, generally around one chi to one and a half chi.

    In the northern spring soybean production areas, after the previous crop is harvested, stubble should be dealt with immediately, and plowing should be completed before freezing, with immediate harrowing to break up large clods after plowing. The earlier the spring plowing, the better; it can be carried out when the thawing depth reaches the plowing depth, plowing and harrowing immediately to prevent moisture loss. Deep plowing in the Huanghuai Plain often involves turning the upper layer and loosening the lower layer. After deep plowing has weathered through the winter, the land should be harrowed and leveled immediately when it thaws in the spring to avoid moisture loss. Some adopt the method of large-scale irrigation to promote soil consolidation and increase soil moisture. For sandy soils, some also use stone rollers with a diameter of more than one chi for compaction to prevent collapse and air leakage. For wheat stubble soybeans, the stubble should be dealt with immediately after the wheat harvest, basal fertilizer should be applied, and the land should be plowed. At this time, the temperature is high and evaporation is high, so the land should be harrowed in time to conserve moisture.

    The quality of land preparation directly affects the quality of sowing and emergence. Therefore, it is required that the cultivated layer be loose on top and firm underneath, that is, the lower layer is firm and contains sufficient moisture, and the upper layer is flat and loose to reduce soil moisture evaporation. In 1958, various regions created the experience of layered fertilization and multiple tillages combined with deep plowing, achieving fertilization at every layer and soil-fertilizer integration, so that the soil formed a thick cultivated layer in a short period.

    Soybeans Also Need Fertilizer

    Fertilization practices vary in different soybean production areas in China, but most areas have long been accustomed to not applying fertilizer. Although some areas apply fertilizer, the amount is very small, making it difficult to meet the needs of soybean growth. Some people believe that soybeans are highly adaptable and have rhizobia to fix free nitrogen, so they do not need fertilizer, which is incorrect. It cannot be denied that soybeans are more tolerant of barrenness than other crops such as wheat and corn, but this does not mean that soybeans do not need fertilizer. It is true that rhizobia fix nitrogen, but it is inappropriate to think that they can supply most of the nitrogen needed for soybean growth and development. Some people also believe that applying too much fertilizer (especially nitrogen fertilizer) will cause lodging and excessive growth, so they have concerns about fertilization, which is also unnecessary. Judging from high-yield cultivation materials in various regions, taking measures such as applying sufficient basal fertilizer, applying topdressing fertilizer in stages, and increasing the proportion of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers on the premise of applying more nitrogen-rich fertilizers is an important key to high yield.

    1. Apply sufficient basal fertilizer, apply in layers, and combine slow-release and quick-acting fertilizers: Experience in various regions shows that basal fertilizer is of great significance for ensuring high-yield soybean production. For example, according to the comparison results in Xiangzhou Village, Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, applying basal fertilizer increased yield by 30% compared to not applying basal fertilizer. According to the comparison results of our institute's base point in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, applying 8,000 to 10,000 jin of basal fertilizer (farm manure) per mu increased yield by more than 25% compared to not applying basal fertilizer.

    2. Increase the proportion of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers on the premise of increasing nitrogen fertilizers: Soybeans need more nitrogen than other crops. From the materials of Soviet A.B. Vladimirov and others, it is known that their nitrogen demand (when forming the same amount of dry matter) is 1.3 times more than spring wheat. High-yield fields in various regions generally apply a considerable amount of nitrogen-rich human and animal manure, ammonium sulfate, etc. In the Huanghuai Plain and its southern regions, the application of human and animal manure is still relatively common in high-yield soybean fields, and a considerable amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers such as pig manure, ash, and superphosphate are also applied to meet the needs of soybean growth.

    3. Apply topdressing fertilizer in stages: Topdressing fertilizer in stages is mostly carried out around the seedling stage, flowering stage (before and after the first flowering), and podding stage. For example, in the Huanghuai Plain and some other regions, high-yield soybean fields mostly apply human and animal manure rich in nitrogen and phosphorus elements after thinning seedlings; quick-acting nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers can be applied during the flowering stage. Soybean lodging occurs during the flowering stage, so potassium fertilizer should be applied before flowering.

    4. Pay attention to fertilization methods: Slow-release fertilizers should be applied early as basal fertilizers, and some quick-acting fertilizers can also be applied as basal fertilizers. The remaining quick-acting fertilizers should be applied in stages, preferably in strips near the roots by opening ditches. Topdressing should be carried out before or after irrigation and rainfall to fully exert the effectiveness of the fertilizer. Inoculating soybeans with rhizobia is a simple and effective measure to increase production, and it has different degrees of yield increase effects in various regions.

    5. Fertilizer application rate: According to the level of 1,000 to 2,000 jin of soybeans per mu, the application of basal fertilizer (manure) should be no less than 20,000 jin per mu. Three to five hundred jin of dried human feces per mu, used as basal fertilizer and topdressing during the seedling stage. Ammonium sulfate and superphosphate are suitable for application during the seedling and flowering stages, and the application rate per mu can be 30-50 jin each. The latter can also be used for basal fertilizer and the podding stage, and 400-500 jin of wood ash per mu. Other fertilizers such as lime, shell ash, and trace elements can be applied at the discretion of the soil conditions in each region.

    Also Need Appropriate Close Planting

    Reducing the ridge spacing, increasing the number of rows, and increasing the sowing rate to 8 to 15 jin per mu can result in approximately 16,000 to 30,000 plants per mu. In areas where the number of days suitable for soybean growth is shorter, the density can be increased appropriately. In the past, wider row spacing was mostly adopted, with a small sowing rate of only 4-5 jin per mu, with no more than 12,000 to 16,000 grains. It was thought that planting soybeans too densely would result in poor ventilation and light transmission, saying "beans grow beside stalks, wheat grows in rows," and "sparse wheat and dense beans kill people." This statement can only reflect the soybean cultivation techniques in the past under shallow tillage, less fertilizer, or even no fertilizer conditions. The fact that soybean production was high in 1958 has broken this conventional wisdom. Generally speaking, within a suitable density range and nutritional conditions, when the density is increased, although the number of branches and the productivity per plant will be reduced, the increase in yield due to the appropriate increase in the number of plants greatly exceeds the value reduced per plant after the number of plants is increased.

    Judging from the deeds of high-yield soybean cultivation, the results of experimental investigations, and the existing density range in 1958, the potential for appropriately increasing density is very large.

    For close planting methods, the general approach is to appropriately reduce row spacing and increase the sowing rate while maintaining a certain plant spacing. Some areas also widen the sowing width.

    Seize the Sowing Season

    The majority of farmers have a deep understanding of seizing the sowing season. In 1958, high-yield soybean fields in various parts of the Northeast correspondingly advanced the sowing time, generally advancing the sowing time to mid-April (southern part) to early May (northern part). Appropriate early sowing can not only avoid early spring seedling drought, but also increase the number of days for growth and development. The experience of Yuanliuzhuo Commune in Putian County, Fujian Province is that it is best to sow seven days before the vernal equinox, which can reduce the harm of soybean pod borers and avoid the drought during the podding stage. Summer and autumn soybeans should be sown as early as possible. The results of the sowing date experiment conducted by our institute at the base point (formerly Minsheng Commune) in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province in 1957: sowing on June 17 increased yield by 17.4% compared to sowing five days later. The sowing date for summer soybeans should not be later than mid-June. Autumn soybeans should be planted before the beginning of autumn.

    Strengthen Field Management

    1. Implement early thinning and timely thinning: Adopting thinning measures can make seedlings grow vigorously without growing excessively. After the seedlings have emerged completely, they should be thinned immediately to give them a certain interval and reduce the consumption of water and nutrients. When the seedlings are four to five inches tall (after the appearance of compound leaves), the seedlings should be thinned at equal intervals. In the cold and cool areas of early spring, the seedlings can be thinned multiple times due to slow growth; in the summer and autumn soybean areas, the temperature is high and the growth is fast during the seedling stage, so the seedlings can be thinned once or not thinned, and the seedlings can be thinned in time.

    2. Intertillage and weeding: The depth and number of intertillage and weeding should be determined according to the development of the soybean root system, soil moisture, soil compaction, and the degree of weed growth. Generally, intertillage can be carried out two to four times; intertillage should be combined with thinning and topdressing. Multiple intertillage during the seedling stage can inhibit seedling overgrowth and promote vigorous branching. Harrowing the land before and after emergence is an effective way to eliminate weeds and destroy compaction, but technical attention must be paid to mastering it. In areas with earthing habits, the amount of soil for the first earthing should be small because the seedlings are small, and the amount of earthing can be gradually increased later. In fields with many weeds, a plowing method can be adopted to suppress weeds. Earthing also has the effect of preventing lodging and facilitating drainage. In areas where the malignant weed dodder occurs, field inspections should be strengthened at all times to prevent its spread, and measures should also be taken to prevent its spread. Quarantine weeds must be completely eliminated.

    3. Irrigation and drainage: Soybeans need a lot of water, but it also varies depending on the growth stage. They are more drought-tolerant before flowering, and too much water during this period will make the main roots underdeveloped, which will reduce the drought resistance in the later stage. During the flowering and podding stages, more water is needed. The agricultural saying "beans bloom, shrimp are caught in the ditch" means this. Drought during the flowering period will lead to an increase in the rate of flower and pod abscission, which will reduce yield. Therefore, irrigation can be carried out during the flowering and podding stages to supplement water. Of course, irrigation should also be carried out if there is drought in each development stage.

    Attention should also be paid to drainage when cultivating soybeans. Cloudy weather and excessive rainfall easily lead to flower abscission and pod abscission, and more attention should be paid to this in low-lying, cold, and cool areas.

    The soybean high-yield achievements in various regions show that the selection of fine varieties is also one of the keys to high yield. Under the conditions of deep plowing, increasing fertilizer application, setting up irrigation equipment, and rational close planting, new requirements have also been put forward for varieties. For example, high-yielding varieties with compact plant types, smaller leaves or narrow-elongated leaves, more pods on the main stem, no lodging, and strong resistance are the most popular.

　　充分挖掘大豆增产潜力
　　——1958年大豆丰产的基本经验——
　　中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    1958年我国大豆生产飞跃发展，全国大豆平均亩产一百七十斤左右，为1957年的161.8％。全国各地出现了不少大面积丰产和高额丰产的新记录。
    生产实践证明，改不耕为耕翻或深耕，改不施肥为施肥，改稀植为合理密植，是大豆增产的主要关键。虽然1958年全国大豆单位面积产量比1957年增长61.8％左右，但仍大大落后于粮棉等作物的增长速度。从各地丰产事例来看，大豆增产潜力还很大。我们通过分析大豆丰产栽培材料和调查研究结果，总结了1958年大豆丰产经验，并提出对1959年大豆丰产栽培技术措施的意见。
    深耕是增产的基础
    深耕是大豆增产的基础。大豆是深根作物，在良好耕作条件下，主根深入土中；反之，主根不发达，支根多局限于土壤表层。
    据山东省诸城县相州村1958年的对比结果，耕地比不耕地增产15％—20％；湖南省1958年大豆现场会材料表明，耕地的每株根瘤比不耕地的多四十二个。1958年我所在寿张县基点进行耕地对比结果，耕地的比不耕地的每株粒数多、主根长、产量高，而且不倒伏，不耕的就有倒伏现象。深耕不仅使植株健壮高大、节数多、分枝多、单株和单位面积产量增加，主根得以向纵深发展，这就加强了植株的牢固程度，也为密植创造了条件。这就否定了“种豆不用犁地”、“犁地种豆子出不齐，好楞青”等错误看法。至于大豆大面积丰产栽培的耕翻深度，应因地制宜的加以规定，一般可在一尺到一尺半左右。
    北方春大豆产区，在前作物收获后，应即处理残茬，并在封冻前翻耕完毕，翻后立即耙碎大垡块。春翻地越早越好，在化冻深度达到耕翻深度时即可进行，随耕随耙防止跑墒。黄淮平原的深翻地多采取上层翻动、下层松土办法。深翻地经一冬风化，至来春解冻时立即耙地平整田面，避免跑墒。有的采取大水浇灌方法，促使土壤塌实，增加土壤水分。对砂质土壤也有用直径一尺多的石滚进行镇压的，以防止塌陷透风。麦茬大豆要在小麦收获后，立即处理残茬，铺上底肥翻地，此时气温高，蒸发量大，应及时耙地保墒。
    整地好坏直接影响播种和出苗质量，因之要求耕作层上虚下实，即下层塌实含有充足水分，上层平坦疏松以减少土壤水分蒸发。1958年各地创造了结合深耕的分层施肥和多耕耙的经验，做到层层有肥，土肥交融，使土壤在较短时期内形成肥厚的耕作层。
    大豆同样需要肥料
    我国各大豆产区施肥情况各有不同，但大部分地区长期习惯于不施肥料。有些地区虽施肥，但施肥量甚少，难以满足大豆生长的需要。有些人认为大豆适应性强，又有根瘤菌固定游离态氮素，可不施肥，这是不对的。不可否认大豆比起其他作物如小麦、玉米等耐瘠性强，但绝不意味着大豆不需要肥料。根瘤菌固定氮素是事实，但认为它能供给大豆生长发育所需氮素的大部也是不合适的。也有些人认为施肥（尤其是氮肥）多了会倒伏、徒长，以至对施肥有顾虑，这也是不必要的。从各地丰产栽培材料来看，在多施用富于氮素肥料前提下，采取施足底肥、分期追肥、增加磷钾质肥比例等措施，正是丰产的重要关键。
    1、施足底肥，分层施入，迟效肥速效肥并举：各地经验表明，基肥对保证大豆丰产有重要意义。如山东省诸城县相州村对比结果，施基肥的比不施基肥的增产30％。我所在山东省寿张基点对比结果，每亩施用基肥（圈肥）八千到一万斤的比不施用基肥的增产25％以上。
    2、在增施氮素肥料前提下，增加磷钾肥的比例：大豆需氮量比其他作物为多，从苏联A·B·符拉基米洛夫等材料得知，其所需氮量（形成等量干物质时）要比春小麦多一点三倍。各地丰产田一般均施用了相当数量含氮量高的人粪尿、硫酸铵等。黄淮平原及其以南地区，大豆丰产田施用人粪尿还是比较普遍的，同时还配合施用相当数量的磷、钾肥，如猪粪、草木灰以及过磷酸钙等等，以供大豆生育需要。
    3、分期追肥：分期追肥多围绕苗期、开花期（初花前后）、结荚期三个生长发育阶段进行。如黄淮平原和一些地区的大豆丰产田多在定苗后追施富于氮、磷元素的人粪尿；开花期可追施速效性氮、磷肥。大豆倒伏发生在开花阶段，故应在开花前追施钾肥。
    4、注意施肥方法：迟效肥应早施做基肥用，一部分速效性肥也可做基肥施用，其余的速效肥应分期追施，以接近根部开沟条施为好。要在灌水、降雨前后趁墒追施，以充分发挥肥料效力。给大豆接种根瘤菌是简而易行的有效增产措施，在各地都有不同程度增产效果。
    5、肥料施用量：按亩产大豆一千到二千斤水平，每亩施用基肥（厩肥）应不少于二万斤。人粪干每亩三到五百斤，做基肥和苗期追施。硫酸铵和过磷酸钙均宜于苗期、开花期施用，每亩施用量可各为三十——五十斤，后者也可供基肥及结荚期施用，草木灰每亩四百——五百斤。其他肥料如石灰、壳灰、微量元素等可根据各地区的土质情况酌情施用。
    也要适当密植
    缩垅增行，播种量增加为每亩八到十五斤，每亩株数可在一万六千到三万株左右。在适宜大豆生长的天数较短的地区，密度还可适当增加；过去多采用较宽行距，播种量小，每亩才四——五斤，粒数不过一万二到一万六千粒。认为豆子种密了通风透光不好，说“豆打旁秸麦打齐”、“稀麦稠豆坑死人”。这种说法只能反映以往在浅耕少肥甚至无肥条件下的大豆栽培技术，1958年大豆丰产事实已经打破了这种常规。一般说来，在适宜的密度范围和营养条件下，增加密度时，分枝数和单株生产力虽然会有所降低，但由于适当增多了株数所增加的产量大大超过因增多株数后单株所减低之值。
    从1958年大豆丰产栽培事迹、试验调查结果以及现有密度范围来看，适当增加密度的潜力很大。
    密植方式，一般多采取在保持一定株距前提下，适当缩小行距、增加播种量等办法。也有些地区加宽播幅。
    抓紧播种季节
    广大农民对抓紧播种时期都有很深的认识。1958年东北各处大豆丰产田均相应提早播种，一般将播种时期提早至4月中旬（南部）到5月上旬（北部）。适当早播不仅可以避免早春苗期干旱，也增加了生长发育日数。福建省莆田县原柳卓社经验是在春分前七天播种为好，这可减轻豆荚螟为害和避过结荚期的干旱。夏、秋大豆播种愈早愈好。1957年我所在山东省寿张县基点（原民生社）所进行的播种期试验结果：6月17日播种比晚播五天的增产17.4％。夏大豆的播种期不宜迟于6月中旬。秋大豆应在立秋前种完。
    加强田间管理
    1、实行早疏苗，适期定苗：采用疏苗措施可使幼苗健旺生长而不至于徒长。苗出齐后，即应疏苗，使之均有一定间隔，减少水分养分消耗。苗高四寸到五寸时（出现复叶后），应按等距定苗。在早春冷凉地区，因生长迟缓，可多次疏苗；在夏秋大豆区，苗期气温高，生长快，可疏一次苗或不疏苗，适时定苗就可以了。
    2、中耕除草：中耕除草的深度和次数要根据大豆根系发育状况、土壤水分及其板结情况和杂草滋生程度来决定。一般可中耕二次到四次；中耕要结合间苗、追肥进行。苗期多次中耕可抑制幼苗徒长，并促进旺盛分枝。出苗前后耙地是消灭杂草、破坏板结的有效办法，但在技术上须留意掌握。在有培土习惯地区，第一次培土因苗小土量宜少，以后可逐渐增多培土量。在杂草多的田块，可采取先趟一犁的办法抑制杂草。培土也有防止倒伏和便于排水的作用。在有恶性野草菟丝子发生的地区，要时刻加强田间检查，防止蔓延，同时也要采取措施杜绝它的传播途径。对检疫性杂草要彻底消除。
    3、灌水排水：大豆需水量较多，但也因不同的生育阶段而异。开花前较为耐旱，在此期间水分过多，主根反而不发达，会降低后期抗旱能力。开花结荚阶段，需要较多水分。农谚“豆子开花，沟里摸虾”就是这个意思。花期干旱将招致花、荚脱落率增多，就会减产。因之，开花结荚阶段可进行灌溉增补水分。当然，各发育阶段如逢干旱，也应灌溉。
    栽培大豆也要注意排水问题，天气阴晦、雨水过多，每易?花、?荚，在低湿冷凉地区更应注意。
    各地大豆丰产成就表明，选用良种也是丰产关键之一。在深耕土地、增施肥料、设置灌溉设备和合理密植的情况下，也为品种提出了新的要求。如株型紧凑、叶较小或叶型窄长、主茎结荚多、不倒伏、抗逆性强的丰产品种是最受欢迎的。
