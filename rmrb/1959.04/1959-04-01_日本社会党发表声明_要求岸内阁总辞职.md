Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 30th. - The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today demanding the immediate collective resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet. The statement said that the Socialist Party advocates opposing rearmament and believes that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement" violate the Japanese Constitution. The Socialist Party has always opposed the establishment of U.S. military bases in Japan and opposed the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan. However, the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling party, relying on its majority seats in the Diet, trampled on the Constitution, implemented rearmament, turned Japan into a U.S. military base, and embarked on the road to war. The statement also said that the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet also misinterpreted the Constitution, stubbornly claiming that Japan's nuclear armament and dispatch of troops abroad were "legal," and embarked on the dangerous road of preparing for nuclear war. The statement said that during this period, the Japanese people's struggle to safeguard the Constitution and strive for peace and independence has become a nationwide movement. However, the Nobusuke Kishi government has mobilized the police and procuratorial authorities to do their utmost to suppress the people's struggle.

    日本社会党发表声明
    要求岸内阁总辞职
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，要求岸信介内阁立即实行总辞职。声明说，社会党主张反对重整军备，并且认为日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”是违反日本宪法的。社会党一直反对在日本建立美国军事基地，反对美军驻扎在日本。可是岸信介政府和执政党依仗它在国会中的多数议席蹂躏宪法，实行重整军备，把日本变成美国的军事基地，走上战争的道路。声明还说，岸信介内阁还曲解宪法，硬把日本实行核武装和派兵出国的行为说成是“合法”的，走上了准备核战争的危险道路。声明说，在这期间，日本人民维护宪法、争取和平和独立的斗争已经成为全民性的运动。但是，岸信介政府却动员警察和检察当局竭力镇压人民的斗争。
