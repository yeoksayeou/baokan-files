Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan. After attending the first session of the Second National People's Congress, I was greatly educated and inspired by Premier Zhou's Government Work Report. What is most encouraging is that, for more than four years, thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved extremely brilliant achievements in the great cause of socialist revolution and construction. Not only have we successfully completed and overfulfilled my country's First Five-Year Plan, but in 1958, the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, a great leap forward in the national economy unprecedented in my country's history occurred. At the same time, people's communes combining workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrating government and communes, have been formed in rural areas across the country, promoting the continued development of productive forces. I firmly believe that under the glorious guidance of the Party's general line for building socialism, we will certainly be able to complete and overfulfill the 1959 plan with a higher speed and on a larger scale than in 1958.

Recently, the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, launched an armed rebellion betraying the motherland and undermining unity, attempting to return the Tibetan people to a dark and impoverished state, enslaved by imperialism. All these crimes are intolerable to the people of the whole country, and therefore they are bound to suffer a shameful defeat. For the sake of the unity of the motherland, for the sake of safeguarding national unity, and for the sake of the complete liberation of the working people of Tibet, I firmly support the measures proposed by Premier Zhou in his report regarding quelling the rebellion in Tibet, so that national regional autonomy can be quickly realized in Tibet and democratic reforms can be gradually implemented.

As a medical worker, I would like to express some opinions on issues related to eliminating pests and diseases. Before liberation, due to the indifference of successive ruling classes to the suffering of the masses, the people's lives were extremely poor, and it was impossible to effectively fight against diseases, resulting in the prevalence of various diseases. In rural areas, parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, malaria, kala-azar, filariasis, and hookworm disease were the most harmful, seriously affecting people's health and agricultural production. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, in accordance with the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program, we fought against the above-mentioned five major parasitic diseases and achieved great results. Especially in 1958, in the upsurge of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, inspired by Chairman Mao's poem "Farewell, God of Plague," a vigorous great leap forward also emerged on the front line of prevention and treatment of the five major parasitic diseases. Take kala-azar as an example. It has been prevalent in fifteen provinces and regions north of the Yangtze River for about a hundred years and has now reached basic elimination. Shandong Province is the area with the most serious prevalence of kala-azar, with the number of patients accounting for about one-third of the total number of patients in the country. In the past, most farmers who contracted kala-azar could not get treatment and had to let nature take its course, resulting in countless deaths every year. Many terrible folk songs once circulated in various parts of my province, such as "If big belly swelling (a folk name for kala-azar) gets on you, the King of Hell is tying your heels"; "If you get big belly swelling, nine out of ten die, if you have money you can see a doctor, if you don't have money you can only die," and so on. However, through active prevention and treatment in recent years, the number of patients has decreased significantly. Especially in 1958, my province put forward the fighting slogan of "Fighting for a hundred days to basically eliminate kala-azar," mobilizing and organizing more than 20,600 medical personnel to conduct a general survey and prevention and treatment throughout the province, reducing the incidence of kala-azar from 35 per 10,000 in 1950 to 0.3 per 10,000, a decrease of 99.1 percent. Efforts are currently being made to eradicate this disease. The vast number of farmers in my province have greatly improved their health conditions due to being freed from the harm of kala-azar, thereby ensuring the development of agricultural production. The reason why we have been able to achieve great achievements in the prevention and treatment of kala-azar is mainly due to the leadership of the Party and relying on the strength of the masses. Facts have proved that only under the superior social system of New China can various diseases be effectively prevented and eliminated.

Premier Zhou pointed out in his report that the main task of the people of the whole country this year is to actively strive to complete the national economic plan centered on the four major indicators of industrial and agricultural production. In order to better serve production, patriotic health campaigns centered on eliminating pests and diseases must be carried out more deeply and extensively in the field of health work. We should take active actions to strive to basically eliminate the five pests and eliminate the five major parasitic diseases this year to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. Based on the experience of the great leap forward in 1958, as long as we continue to strengthen the leadership of the Party, implement political command, closely integrate with production, vigorously carry out mass movements, resolutely implement the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, further give play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine, and adopt the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," we will certainly be able to complete this glorious task. I am willing to unite with the vast number of medical personnel in future work, continue to move forward, and work together to build a great motherland.

### 彻底肃清叛匪　解救西藏人民  王兆俊委员的发言

    彻底肃清叛匪　解救西藏人民
    王兆俊委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意李维汉副主席所作的关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。在列席第二届全国人民代表大会首次会议上，听了周总理的政府工作报告，我受到了很大的教育与启发。最令人欢欣鼓舞的是，四年多来我国人民，由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，在伟大的社会主义革命和建设事业中取得了极其辉煌的成就，不但胜利完成和超额完成了我国第一个五年计划，而且在一九五八年，也就是第二个五年计划的第一年，出现了在我国历史上前所未有的国民经济大跃进。同时在全国农村中组成了工农商学兵相结合的、政社结合的人民公社，推动了生产力的继续向前发展。我深信在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我们一定能够完成和超额完成比一九五八年速度更高、规模更为宏大的一九五九年计划。
    最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，发动了背叛祖国和破坏统一的武装叛乱，妄想使西藏人民重新回到黑暗、贫困的境地，受帝国主义的奴役。这一切罪行是全国人民所不能容忍的，因此他们必然要遭到可耻的失败。为了祖国统一，为了维护民族团结，为了西藏劳动人民的彻底解放，我坚决拥护周总理在报告中提出的关于平息西藏叛乱的措施，使在西藏迅速实现民族地方自治和逐步实行民主改革。
    作为一个医务工作者，我愿再就除害灭病方面的有关问题发表一些意见。解放前，由于历代统治阶级对群众疾苦漠不关心，人民的生活极端贫困，不可能同病害作有效的斗争，造成了各种疾病的流行。在农村中以血吸虫病、疟疾、黑热病、丝虫病、钩虫病等寄生虫病的危害最大，严重地影响了人民健康和农业生产。解放后，我们在党和政府的正确领导下，根据全国农业发展纲要中的规定，向上述五大寄生虫病作斗争，取得了很大的成绩，特别是一九五八年在全国工农业生产大跃进高潮中，在毛主席所做送瘟神诗的鼓舞下，在五大寄生虫病防治战线上也出现了一个轰轰烈烈的大跃进局面。以黑热病为例，流行在长江以北的十五个省区，约有百年的历史，现已达到基本消灭。山东省是黑热病流行最严重的地区，患病人数约占全国病人总数的三分之一，因为过去农民得了黑热病，大都得不到治疗，只好听其自然，每年因此而死亡的不计其数，在我省各地曾经流传着很多可怕的民谣，如“大肚子痞（黑热病俗名）缠了身，阎王拴着脚后跟”；“得了大肚痞，十患九人死，有钱能看病，无钱只好死”等等。但是通过这几年来的积极防治，患病人数有了显著的下降，特别是在一九五八年我省提出了“奋战百日，基本上消灭黑热病”的战斗口号，发动组织了二万零六百余名医务人员，在全省范围内进行了普遍的调查和防治，使黑热病的患病率由一九五○年的万分之三十五，降至万分之零点三，减少了百分之九十九点一。目前正在为根除这一疾病而努力。我省广大农民由于摆脱了黑热病的危害，健康状况有了很大的改善，从而保证了农业生产的发展。我们在黑热病防治工作中所以能够取得巨大的成就，主要是由于党的领导，依靠了群众的力量。事实已经证明，只有在新中国这样优越的社会制度下，才能有效地防治和消灭各种疾病。
    周总理在报告中指出，今年全国人民的主要任务，就是积极努力，为完成以工农业生产的四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而奋斗。为了更好地为生产服务，在卫生工作方面必须更深入更广泛地开展以除害灭病为中心的爱国卫生运动。我们应以积极的行动，争取在今年基本上除尽五害，消灭五大寄生虫病，来迎接建国十周年。根据一九五八年大跃进的经验，只要继续加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，密切结合生产，大搞群众运动，坚决贯彻党的中医政策，进一步发挥中医中药的作用，并采取“土洋结合”的方针，我们一定能够完成这一光荣任务。我愿在今后工作中，与广大医务人员团结一起，继续前进，共同为建设伟大的祖国而努力。
