Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 23rd: Tibetan members of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in Lhasa, and Tibetan responsible cadres from various departments of the Preparatory Committee, studied the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials in Tezpur on April 18 at a meeting on the 21st. These individuals, who personally experienced and witnessed the Lhasa rebellion, unanimously pointed out that this clumsy document, which is full of sophistry, lies, and loopholes, is extremely hypocritical and was created by certain foreigners in the name of the Dalai Lama.

The Tibetan members and cadres pointed out that the tone, wording, and grammatical structure of this statement are completely inconsistent with the habits of the Tibetan people and do not align with the views expressed by the Dalai Lama in the past. They expressed extreme indignation at the many lies in the statement that distort the truth and reverse black and white. Jiang Jin·Suolangjebu, head of the Culture and Education Department, refuted the lie in the statement that Tibet sometimes acted as an independent country, saying: Tibet has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The Dalai Lamas of successive generations had to be conferred by the central government, and senior officials had to be appointed by the central government. The many imperial edicts, seals, and cultural relics that are still preserved are powerful proof of this. The fact that Tibet is the territory of the motherland is a well-known and historically verifiable fact; it is groundless to say that Tibet is "independent." Zhan Dong·Luosanglangjie, head of the Construction Department, said that since Tibet is Chinese territory, the claim that the central government interferes in Tibet's internal affairs is fundamentally untenable. Moreover, the central government has faithfully implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement and there has been no interference whatsoever with the Dalai Lama's inherent status and powers, Tibet's religious beliefs, customs, and habits.

Jiacuo Lin Living Buddha, Deputy Director of the Religious Affairs Committee and tutor of the Dalai Lama, said that since the March 10th incident, he had been living in Norbulingka and had never heard or heard of the People's Liberation Army firing two or three shells at Norbulingka. On the contrary, the rebels who surrounded Norbulingka often fired guns and injured people. Jiacuo Lin Living Buddha said that a few days before the Dalai Lama was scheduled to go to the military district auditorium to see a performance, he asked the Dalai Lama for leave because he had something to do. The Dalai Lama told him: "Do not ask for leave, I will go to the military district to see a performance on March 10th, and you must accompany me." Jiacuo Lin Living Buddha said that this fact shows that the date of going to the military district auditorium to see a performance on March 10th was known to the Dalai Lama in advance. However, the statement nonsensically claims it was a "sudden decision," which is clearly an attempt to find an excuse for the treasonous clique to abduct the Dalai Lama.

Lamin·Yixi Chuchen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, said that the appearance of the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" is not surprising. In the future, the Tibetan traitors who have fled abroad will also collude with Indian expansionists and imperialists to engage in shameless activities in the name of the Dalai Lama. However, facts can refute all lies, and any such or such statements will not have any impact on the political and religious life of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people have already embarked on the road to freedom and happiness, and no external interference can stop the rebirth of Tibet.

### 在拉萨的藏族官员纷纷指出  所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”是冒牌假货  一看而知是某些外国人假借达赖名义泡制的

    在拉萨的藏族官员纷纷指出
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”是冒牌假货
    一看而知是某些外国人假借达赖名义泡制的
    新华社拉萨23日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会在拉萨的藏族委员和筹委会各部门的藏族负责干部，21日在一次会议上研究了4月18日在提斯浦尔经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这些拉萨叛乱事件的亲身经历者和目击者一致指出，这个理屈词穷、谎话连篇、漏洞百出的拙劣文件具有极大的虚伪性，它是某些外国人借着达赖喇嘛的名义制造出来的。
    藏族委员和干部们指出，这个声明的语气、用词和语法结构完全不合西藏人民的习惯，并且和达赖喇嘛过去所表示的见解不合。他们对声明中许多颠倒黑白、歪曲事实的谎言极为愤慨，文教处处长江金·索郎杰布驳斥了声明中所谓西藏有时是作为一个独立国家进行活动的谎言，他说：西藏自古以来就是中国的领土，历代的达赖喇嘛都要接受中央政府的册封，高级官员都要接受中央政府的任命，现在还保存着的许多诏书、印鉴、文物就是有力的证明。西藏是祖国的领土是世所周知、有史可查的事实；说西藏是“独立”的，是毫无根据的。建设处处长詹东·洛桑郎杰说，西藏既然是中国的领土，所谓中央干涉西藏内部事务的说法就根本不能成立，何况中央忠实地执行了十七条协议，对达赖喇嘛固有的地位和职权、西藏的宗教信仰、风俗习惯等，根本不存在什么干涉的事。
    宗教事务委员会副主任、达赖喇嘛的侍读嘉措林活佛说，自从3月10日事件发生后，他一直住在罗布林卡里，根本没有听见或听说过人民解放军向罗布林卡打了两三炮的事，倒是包围罗布林卡的叛乱分子经常鸣枪打人。嘉措林活佛说，达赖喇嘛准备去军区礼堂看戏的前几天，他有事向达赖喇嘛请假，达赖喇嘛告诉他说：“你不要请假，3月10日我就要到军区去看戏，你一定要陪我去。”嘉措林活佛说，这个事实可以看出，3月10日去军区礼堂看戏这个日子，是达赖喇嘛事先早就知道的，声明却胡说什么“突然决定”，这分明是企图为叛国集团劫持达赖喇嘛寻找借口。
    筹委会副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣说，所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的出现并不令人感到意外，今后，潜逃国外的西藏叛国分子还会和印度的扩张主义分子以及帝国主义勾结起来，假借达赖喇嘛的名义进行无耻的活动，但是事实可以驳倒一切谎言，任何这样或那样的声明，对西藏人民的政治和宗教生活都不会发生任何影响。西藏人民已经走上了自由幸福的大道，任何外来的干涉都不能阻挡西藏的新生。
