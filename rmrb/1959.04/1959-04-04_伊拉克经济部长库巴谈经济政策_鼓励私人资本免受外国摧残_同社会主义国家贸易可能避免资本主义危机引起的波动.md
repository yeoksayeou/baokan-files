Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 2nd. Iraqi Economy Minister Kuba said today, when meeting with reporters from the Iraqi "News," that the most important principle of the Iraqi government's economic policy is to encourage private capital to become active.

Kuba said that this principle is determined by the nature of the Iraqi revolution. He said, "Our revolution is a democratic revolution based on full cooperation from all classes of the nation. The middle class will play a very important role. Therefore, the private sector will receive the government's attention and encouragement, and be protected by the government from devastation by foreign competition."

The "News" reporter asked to what extent private capital could invest in factories built under agreements concluded with the Soviet Union. Kuba replied, "The factories built according to the agreements have different characteristics. Some of these factories are of a heavy industrial nature, and for various economic reasons, this type of factory must of course belong to the state-owned industrial sector. The most important reason is that this type of industry affects and relates to the vital interests of the country. Moreover, this type of industry requires a huge amount of capital, which is difficult for anyone other than the state to provide; at the same time, this investment cannot generate profits quickly. Light industry or consumer goods industry are sectors in which the government encourages private investment. To this end, the government has decided to start building some model factories to attract private capital."

Kuba said, "The government has taken important practical measures to prepare for the construction of a large number of small-scale industries, which can be completed within a few months and require only a small amount of capital. The government has conducted friendly negotiations with some friendly countries in order to study these projects in a concrete and in-depth manner. The government intends to call on capital owners to make full and partial investments after receiving these research reports."

Kuba said that the Iraqi government will also train Iraqi technical and administrative cadres to build and manage enterprises.

Kuba also answered another question from the "News" reporter: What impact will the economic agreements signed with socialist countries have on Iraq's economy, both now and in the future? Kuba said, "Of course, these agreements cannot take effect immediately overnight. Perhaps one of the most important characteristics of trading with socialist countries is that it makes it possible for the Iraqi government to formulate long-term trade policies, and thus makes it possible to avoid fluctuations caused by capitalist crises on the export side."

The minister added, "The important thing is that a start has been made, and trade and private contacts are developing day by day, bringing many good results to the parties concerned. Although the time since the signing of the above-mentioned agreements is short, Iraq has signed many important contracts with socialist countries, including the famous date transaction with the People's Republic of China, the cotton, wheat, and sugar transaction with the Soviet Union, and many other transactions with other socialist countries."

### 伊拉克经济部长库巴谈经济政策  鼓励私人资本免受外国摧残  同社会主义国家贸易可能避免资本主义危机引起的波动

    伊拉克经济部长库巴谈经济政策
    鼓励私人资本免受外国摧残
    同社会主义国家贸易可能避免资本主义危机引起的波动
    新华社巴格达2日电　伊拉克经济部长库巴今天在接见伊拉克“消息报”记者时说，伊拉克政府经济政策的最重要原则，是要鼓励私人资本活跃起来。
    库巴说，这个原则是由伊拉克革命的性质所决定的。他说，“我们的革命是以全国各阶级充分合作为基础的民主革命。中产阶级将起非常重要的作用。所以，私营部分将受到政府的注意和鼓励，并受到政府的保护，免受外国竞争所摧残。”
    “消息报”记者问到，私人资本可以在多大程度上向那些根据同苏联缔结的协定而建造的工厂进行投资，库巴回答说，“根据协定建设的工厂具有不同的性质。其中有些工厂是属于重工业性质的，由于种种经济原因，这种类型的工厂当然必须属于国营工业部分。最重要的原因是这种类型的工业影响和关系到国家的重要利益。而且，这种工业需要的资本是庞大的，除了国家之外，其他任何人是很难提供的；同时，这种投资也不能很快就获得利润。轻工业或者消费品工业是政府鼓励私人投资的部门。为了这个目的，政府决定开始建造一些示范性的工厂来吸引私人资本。”
    库巴说，“政府已经采取重要的实际措施来筹备建设大批小型工业，这些工程能在几个月内建成，同时只需要少量的资金。政府同某些友好国家进行了友好谈判，以便具体深入地研究这些工程。政府打算在接到这种研究报告后号召资本所有主进行全部和部分的投资”。
    库巴说，伊拉克政府还要培养伊拉克的技术干部和行政管理干部，以便建设和管理企业。
    库巴还回答了“消息报”记者的另一个问题：同社会主义国家签定的经济协定在目前和将来对伊拉克的经济有什么影响。库巴说，“当然，这些协定不能在一夜之间便立刻见效。同社会主义国家进行贸易的最重要特点之一也许是使伊拉克政府有可能制定长期贸易政策，因而有可能在出口方面避免资本主义危机所引起的波动。”
    这位部长又说，“重要的是，已经有了开端，贸易和私人接触日益发展，从而为有关方面带来许多良好的结果。尽管签定上述协定以来的时间很短，但是伊拉克已经同社会主义国家签定了许多重要合同，包括同中华人民共和国进行的著名的椰枣交易，同苏联进行的棉花、小麦和糖的交易以及同其它社会主义国家进行的其它许多交易。”
