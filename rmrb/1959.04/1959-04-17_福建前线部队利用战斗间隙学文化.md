Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Fujian, 16th—The People’s Liberation Army of various services and branches on the Fujian front has launched a cultural learning upsurge, focusing on popularizing secondary education among officers.

	Artillery and infantry units stationed in the forward areas of Xiamen, Lianhe, and other places have opened hundreds of spare-time cultural schools on the front lines. Whenever there is a lull in the fighting, officers bury themselves in studying middle school Chinese and mathematics courses. Officers and soldiers of the naval units use the docks and decks as classrooms, studying diligently against the sea breeze. They write poems describing their learning life, saying: "Every sailor comes out of the cabin, the deck is used as a literacy board, dipping seawater to write new characters, you ask, I answer, remembering in my heart. Waves crash to erase the words, marveling at how quickly the sailors learn." Officers and soldiers of the coastal defense units guarding the outpost islands also make their own blackboards and compasses from old wood and bamboo, and other teaching aids for learning. Xiang Shunyu, a part-time cultural teacher of a certain coastal artillery company, and two others, used four Sundays to print seventy-six copies of textbooks; many units also negotiated with local secondary schools to borrow or purchase a large number of old textbooks.

　　福建前线部队利用战斗间隙学文化
    据新华社福建前线16日电　福建前线人民解放军各军种各部队掀起了以普及干部中等教育为主的文化学习热潮。
    驻守厦门、莲河等前沿地区的炮兵和步兵部队，在前线开办了几百所业余文化学校。每逢战斗空隙，军官们便埋头攻读中学语文和数学课程。海军部队的官兵们把码头和甲板当课堂，冒着海风手不释卷地学习。他们写诗描写自己的学习生活道：“个个水兵出舱来，甲板当作识字牌，手蘸海水写生字，你问我答记心怀。浪花扑来擦字迹，惊叹水兵学的快。”守卫在前哨岛屿上的海防部队的官兵们，还自己动手用旧木料、竹子制作黑板、圆规等各种教具进行学习。海岸炮兵某连兼职文化教员相顺渔等三人，利用四个星期天刻印了课本七十六份；许多单位还和驻区中等学校协商，借用或购买了大批的旧课本。
