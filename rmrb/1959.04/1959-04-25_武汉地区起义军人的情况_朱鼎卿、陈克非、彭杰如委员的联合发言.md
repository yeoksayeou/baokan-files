Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

We express our heartfelt support for Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and Vice Chairman Li's Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee, and we are determined to implement them resolutely.

The three of us are all former military personnel of the old army. We feel extremely honored and excited to attend this conference together. We all come from Wuhan. Since Wuhan was the political and economic center of Central South China in the past and is now a rising industrial city, there are many uprising military personnel transferred here from various locations. Based on our united front activities, we have been in contact with uprising personnel in the Wuhan area. Therefore, we would like to report to the conference on the situation of uprising military personnel in the Wuhan area, especially the changes since the Great Leap Forward.

Transformation

Among the uprising military personnel transferred to the Wuhan area, there are more than 130 officers of the rank of colonel and above. In the past few years, thanks to the Party's patient education, they have all made some progress in their political understanding. Compared with the early days of the uprising, the situation is completely different. This is the first thing we must report to the Party and the people with relief. In terms of work and political treatment, they have all been properly arranged due to the Party's overall consideration. Among them, there are two deputy governors, one deputy mayor, two members of the provincial and municipal people's committees, seventeen directors and deputy directors of provincial and municipal departments and bureaus, and more than twenty people's representatives and members of the provincial and municipal CPPCC committees above the provincial and municipal levels. The rest are working as leaders or general cadres in state organs, schools, and enterprises. Everyone enjoys the same treatment as transferred cadres of the People's Liberation Army. Units with trade union organizations have the right to participate in trade unions and have their length of service calculated from the date of the uprising. In terms of living standards, thanks to the Party's care and consideration, salary grades are generally higher, and special subsidies are sometimes provided based on specific circumstances. Because the Party has been so meticulous in its care for uprising military personnel, the uprising military personnel in the Wuhan area are infinitely grateful to the Party and the people based on their personal feelings, and they wholeheartedly support the Party's uprising policy of "no blame for the past, rewarding meritorious service, education and use, and each according to their ability." However, there are still a few uprising personnel whose ruling privileged ideas from the old era have not been fundamentally eradicated. They do not consider issues from the overall interests of the Party and the people, nor do they consider issues from their own specific conditions, but only haggle over their personal, endless fame, position, and gains, and bargain with the Party, causing many difficulties for the Party. In particular, a very small number of right-wing elements are deliberately spreading discontent among the uprising personnel and inciting the relationship between the uprising military personnel and the Party. These fully demonstrate that the political stance and ideological understanding of the uprising personnel still need to be further strengthened and transformed, otherwise, it is extremely inconsistent with the requirements of the objective situation and the glorious title of uprising military personnel.

The nationwide magnificent rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the uprising military personnel in the Wuhan area, like the people of the whole country, also received a profound class education. In particular, the elimination of a very small number of right-wing elements among the uprising personnel awakened those in the middle who had wavering positions, and they actively transformed to the left. Then, in the face of the realistic education of the Great Leap Forward in production, our uprising personnel more clearly realized that our awareness, our contribution, our drive, and our loyalty to the Party and the socialist cause are far behind the selfless labor of the workers and peasants. And our positions and our lives are far above the workers and peasants. Thus, our ideology improved with the situation of the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, the past unhealthy trend of comparing status and comparing lives has been transformed into the positive spirit of comparing progress and comparing contributions. Under the correct leadership and specific help of the Party, in various positions, uprising comrades emerged as heroes, models, and advanced workers. Uprising comrades holding leadership positions also put forward the goal of striving for upstream and becoming both red and expert. For example, Tu Jiantang, Deputy Director of the Hubei Water Conservancy Department, Duan Chengtang and Duan Guojie, Deputy Directors of the Transportation Department, Wu Changxu, Deputy Director of the Labor Department, and Zeng Zhang, Deputy Director of the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, etc., not only gradually trained and mastered the specialized technology related to their own professional work, but also made great progress and good performance in their work and leadership methods. Uprising comrades working as counselors in the provincial and municipal people's committees also actively joined the ranks of steelmaking during the national campaign to make steel, and even now, more than 20 comrades are still working at the furnace front in the steel plant organized by the Hubei Provincial CPPCC. Their slogan is: "We must use a thousand hammers and hundred refinements to squeeze out all our reactionary bourgeois ideas like slag." Because everyone's thoughts and feelings have undergone major changes, those who had negative emotions in the past have become optimistic and positive, and those who were afraid of movements in the past now realize that education through movements is the rescue for themselves. Everyone believes that the Party's work arrangements and care for our lives are secondary, while education and transformation are the main things. Everyone has put forward the goal of continuing to transform themselves according to the six political criteria advocated by Chairman Mao, and has established a clear goal of becoming leftists within three to five years in their self-transformation plans.

The above-mentioned transformation situation is insignificant when measured by the leap forward of the people of the whole country, but from the specific situation of the uprising personnel, it cannot be said that it is a good phenomenon, and this good phenomenon is also sufficient to show that the Party's brilliant policy for the uprising personnel is not only in line with the interests of the people of the whole country, but also in line with the interests of the uprising military personnel themselves. This is what we, the uprising military personnel on the mainland today, have personally experienced together. We believe that it is also what the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, who are hesitating and at a crossroads, can strive to achieve.

Refuting Rumors

The Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan have doubts and distortions about the great policies of the Communist Party. This is the result of historical prejudices and the obscuring of factual truths. It is said that Taiwan spread rumors as early as 1952 that Zhu Dingqing had been suppressed. This malicious propaganda also has its one-sided basis, because in terms of Zhu Dingqing's historical crimes, it is difficult to obtain the understanding of the masses after awakening, especially the understanding of the people of Hubei. However, the Party's uprising policy not only guarantees Zhu Dingqing's life, but also gives him extremely preferential treatment in all aspects. When Zhu Dingqing suffered from acute myocardial infarction last year, he was once in extreme danger. The leading comrades of the Hubei Party mobilized Wuhan Chinese and Western famous doctors for consultation, and after several rescues, the result turned from danger to safety, and he quickly recovered his health. If it were not for the Party's cordial care, then Zhu Dingqing would not be able to come to the capital today to participate in such a grand conference. Furthermore, regarding Chen Kefei and Peng Jieru, Chen Kefei is both a Whampoa student and a native of Zhejiang. In Chiang Kai-shek's mind in the past, he had a double sectarian relationship. Before the liberation of the Southwest, Chen Kefei's family fled to Taiwan and has not returned yet. These signs will inevitably make the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan believe that Chen Kefei will not have good results. Peng Jieru is a graduate of the first class of Whampoa, a student of Chiang Kai-shek, who betrayed the revolution after the Northern Expedition and was a long-term enemy of the people, especially participating in the so-called "anti-communist encirclement and suppression" in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border area, which was a heinous crime. At the beginning of the uprising in Hunan, he had doubts and fears that he would be retaliated against in the future. However, Chen Kefei and Peng Jieru have been constantly cared for and trusted by the Party since the uprising in 1949, and their political status and living standards far exceed those of the former reactionary rule. From these iron facts, it all shows that the Party's great policy is completely based on the interests of the country and the people, no matter what his history and what social relations are, and no matter how great the past crimes were, as long as he truly stands under the banner of patriotism and contributes to the socialist cause of the motherland, he will be treated equally.

Now the whole world is in a climax of peace people opposing aggression and opposing war. Whether it is from the aspects of large population, popular support, production development, scientific and technological achievements, and military superiority, the east wind prevails over the west wind, and the peace forces are rising day by day, and the aggression forces are weakening day by day. Under such a favorable international situation for us, it is a good time for the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan to judge the situation and choose a way out. The three of us used to be long-term soldiers with many old friends in Taiwan, who have experienced many hardships. Now we are living a peaceful and happy life in the strong motherland family, while they are still drifting on the island, humiliated under the iron hooves of American imperialism. The bitterness of their situation is understandable. I am with ten thousand points of enthusiasm, hoping that they will carry forward the national spirit, on the premise of loving the country as one family, and loving the country regardless of priority, and strive to jointly drive away American imperialism, realize the peaceful liberation of Taiwan as soon as possible, and complete the great cause of the reunification of the motherland.

    武汉地区起义军人的情况
    朱鼎卿、陈克非、彭杰如委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    周总理所作的政府工作报告，李副主席所作的第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，我们表示衷心拥护，并坚决贯彻执行。
    我们三人，都是旧军人，这次同来出席大会，感到无比光荣和兴奋。我们都来自武汉，由于武汉地区过去是中南政治经济中心，现在又是新兴的工业城市，因而从各方面转业来到此地的起义军人为数不少，我们基于统一战线的活动，曾对武汉地区起义人员进行过联系工作，因而，我们想就武汉地区起义军人的情况，特别是大跃进以来的变化情况，向大会汇报一下。
    转变
    转业到武汉地区的起义军人中，计有上校以上的一百三十多人，几年来，由于党的耐心教育，在政治认识上，都有一定程度的进步，拿起义初年来作比较，则前后迥然不同，这一点须首先向党和人民告慰的。在工作和政治待遇上，由于党的统筹兼顾，都得到了适当安排，其中有副省长二人，副市长一人，省市人委委员二人，省市厅局长级十七人，省市以上人民代表和省市政协委员共二十多人，其余都在国家机关学校企业各个方面，做领导或一般干部工作，每个人享有与人民解放军干部转业的同等待遇。有工会组织的单位，享有参加工会，并有自起义之日起计算工龄的权利。在生活待遇上，由于党的关怀照顾，薪级评定一般较高，而且根据具体情况，有时还得到特别补助。由于党对起义军人这样的无微不至，因而武汉地区的起义军人，在切身感受之下，对党和人民都怀着无限的感激，对党的“既往不咎，立功受奖，教育使用，各得其所”的起义政策，表示衷心拥戴。但是其中也还有少数起义人员，由于旧时代的统治特权思想，没有得到根本铲除，他们不从党和人民的整体利益考虑问题，也不从自己的具体条件考虑问题，而只是斤斤计较个人无止境的名位和得失，向党讨价还价，给党造成许多困难，特别是其中极少数右派分子，竟别有用心的在起义人员中，散布不满情绪，挑拨起义军人与党的关系，这些充分说明起义人员的政治立场和思想认识，还有待于进一步的加强改造，否则是与客观形势的要求，和起义军人的光荣称号，是极不相称的。
    全国波澜壮阔的整风运动，和反右派斗争，武汉地区的起义军人，也和全国人民一样受到一场深刻的阶级教育，特别是起义人员中清除了极少数的右派分子，更惊醒了立场动摇的中间状态，积极向左转化。接着在生产大跃进的现实教育面前，使我们起义人员更清楚的认识到我们的觉悟、我们的贡献、我们的干劲，比之忘我劳动、对党和社会主义事业有无限忠诚的工农群众，处处都相差甚远，而我们的职位，我们的生活，都是远远超过工农群众之上，这样在思想上，随着大跃进的形势有所提高，因而，过去比地位、比生活的歪风，一变而为比进步、比贡献的正气了。在党的正确领导和具体帮助下，各个岗位上的起义同志，出现了功臣、模范、先进工作者，担任领导工作的起义同志，也提出力争上游、红透专深的奋斗目标，如湖北水利厅副厅长涂建堂，交通厅副厅长段成涛、段国杰，劳动厅副厅长伍昌续，市建筑工程局副局长曾章等，在积极从事自己所担任的专职业务上，不仅逐步的锻炼和掌握了与自己业务有关的专门技术，而且在工作和领导方法上，也有很大的进步和好的表现。在省市人委做参事工作的起义同志，在全民大办钢铁的时候，也纷纷主动的投入炼钢行列，直到现在，还有二十多位同志在湖北省政协所组织的炼钢厂，坚持炉前工作，他们的口号是：“要在千锤百炼中，把自己一切反动的资产阶级思想，象炼渣一样的挤掉”。由于大家的思想感情，起了重大的变化，所以过去有消极情绪的现在变成了乐观积极态度，过去怕运动的人，现在更体会到通过运动的教育，才是对自己的挽救，大家都认为党对我们的工作安排和生活的照顾，是次要的，而教育改造，才是主要的。每个人都提出要以毛主席所昭示的六项政治标准，来继续改造自己，并在自我改造规划中，确立三至五年内成为左派的鲜明目标。
    上述这些转变情况，从全国人民的跃进来衡量，是微不足道，但从起义人员具体情况来说，不能不说是一种良好的现象，而这种良好现象，亦足以说明党对起义人员的英明政策，是既符合于全国人民的利益，更符合于起义军人的本身利益，这是今天我们在大陆上的起义军人所共同亲身体会得到的，我们认为也是徘徊歧路的台湾国民党军政人员，可以争取得到的。
    辟谣
    台湾国民党军政人员，对共产党的伟大政策，存有怀疑和歪曲，这是历史成见和事实真相被蒙蔽的结果。听说台湾方面在一九五二年就传说朱鼎卿已被镇压，这种恶意宣传，也有他片面造谣的根据，因为就朱鼎卿的历史罪恶来说，是难以取得觉悟后的群众所谅解的，特别是难以取得湖北人民所谅解的，但是党的起义政策不仅保障了朱鼎卿的生命，而且在各方面还给予了极其优厚的待遇。去年朱鼎卿患急性心肌梗塞病时，一度极其危险，湖北党的领导同志，动员武汉中西名医会诊，几经抢救，结果转危为安，很快就恢复健康。要不是党的亲切关怀，那朱鼎卿今天也不可能来到首都参加这样的盛大会议了。再就陈克非和彭杰如来说，陈克非既是黄埔生又是浙江人，过去在蒋介石的心目中，是双重宗派关系，在西南解放前夕，陈克非的家属逃走台湾，至今还没有返回。这些迹象，在台湾国民党军政人员必然会认为陈克非不会有好的结果的。彭杰如是黄埔第一期毕业，为蒋介石门生，北伐后背叛革命，长期与人民为敌，尤其是参加豫鄂皖边区所谓“反共围剿”，罪大恶极，在湖南起义之初，心存疑虑，深怕将来会受到报复。可是，陈克非和彭杰如自一九四九年起义后，始终不断的得到党的关怀和信任，在政治地位上和生活待遇上远远超过从前反动统治时期。从这些铁的事实，在在都说明党的伟大政策是完全从国家人民的利益出发的，不管他是什么历史和什么社会关系，也不管过去有多大罪恶的人，只要他是真正站到爱国主义旗帜下面来为祖国社会主义事业贡献力量，都会得到一视同仁的待遇的。
    现在全世界正处在和平人民反对侵略、反对战争的高潮时期，无论是从人口众多、人心归向、生产发展、科学技术成就以及军事优越各个方面来说，都是东风压倒西风，和平力量日益高涨，侵略势力日益削弱，在这样有利于我们的国际形势下，正是台湾国民党军政人员审时度势选择出路的良好时机。我们三人过去与台湾许多旧友们，都是长期戎马奔驰，饱经忧患，而今我们在强盛的祖国大家庭里，过着和平安乐的幸福生活，而他们仍然飘零海岛，屈辱在美帝铁蹄之下，其况味之苦是可以理解的。我是怀着万分热忱，希望他们发扬民族精神，在爱国一家，爱国不分先后的前提下，为共同赶走美帝国主义，早日实现和平解放台湾，完成祖国统一的大业而奋斗。
