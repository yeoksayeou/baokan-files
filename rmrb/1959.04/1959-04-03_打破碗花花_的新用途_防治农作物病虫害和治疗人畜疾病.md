Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 2nd. Hongguang Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, recently developed "Hongguang Bactericidal Insecticide" using "Broken Bowl Flower" (also known as wild cotton) as the main raw material. It not only eliminates mosquitoes and flies but also effectively prevents and treats crop pests and diseases, and treats human and animal ailments.

The "Hongguang Bactericidal Insecticide" achieves 100% efficacy when used to control sclerotinia, aphids, and cabbage white butterfly larvae. Hongguang Mielai Liquid No. 1, made from Broken Bowl Flower, can also treat pig mange. It has already cured more than 300 mange-ridden pigs in various communes in Pixian County. Hongguang Mielai Liquid No. 3 is also very effective in treating human scabies. Some patients with scabies who had not grown hair for seven or eight years have started growing hair after using the medicine.

In March of last year, Chairman Mao, after discovering in Hongguang Commune that Broken Bowl Flower could eliminate mosquitoes and flies, encouraged commune cadres and members to find ways to use it to prevent and control crop pests and diseases. The cadres and members of Hongguang Commune were greatly inspired and encouraged. After the establishment of the Hongguang People's Commune in the fall of last year, they immediately established a pesticide factory. Following Chairman Mao's instructions and with the help of the Provincial Department of Agriculture working group, they studied the use of Broken Bowl Flower to manufacture pesticides. After many indoor and outdoor experiments, they extracted an effective medicine for preventing and controlling plant sclerotinia – Hongguang Bactericidal Insecticide – using Broken Bowl Flower and "Green Vitriol" as raw materials. They applied this medicine to a 2.4 mu plot of rapeseed field, while applying "foreign" pesticide "Ceresan" mixed with lime powder to another plot of over 1 mu of rapeseed field. Comparative experiments proved that the efficacy was the same, and the insecticidal efficiency reached 100%.

The Pixian County Party Committee attaches great importance to the promotion of Broken Bowl Flower pesticides. So far, it has successively held three on-site meetings in Hongguang Commune. More than 2,000 cadres above the level of team leader from people's communes throughout the county have participated in the on-site meetings and learned the methods of manufacturing the pesticides. They unanimously agreed that "Hongguang Bactericidal Insecticide" is easy to obtain, low in cost, and remarkably effective, and is worthy of vigorous promotion.

Currently, it is the growing season for Broken Bowl Flower, and the Broken Bowl Flower in various parts of Pixian County is generally six or seven inches tall. All sixteen communes in the county are manufacturing "Hongguang Bactericidal Insecticide." Some communes have already applied this pesticide in vegetable fields. (Attached pictures)

    “打破碗花花”的新用途
    防治农作物病虫害和治疗人畜疾病
    新华社成都2日电　四川郫县红光社最近以“打破碗花花”（又名野棉花）为主要原料，制成“红光杀菌杀虫剂”，不但能灭蚊虫，用来防治农作物病虫害和治疗人、畜疾病效果也很好。
    “红光杀菌杀虫剂”用于防治菌核病、蚜虫、黄白粉蝶幼虫时，药效达到百分之一百。用打破碗花花制成的红光灭癞液一号，还可以治疗猪癞疫，现在郫县各公社已用它治好癞子猪三百多头。红光灭癞液三号治疗人的癞疾，效果也很好，有些七、八年不长头发的癞疾患者用药后，已经长出头发来了。
    去年3月，毛主席在红光社发现用打破碗花花能消灭蚊蝇后，曾鼓励社干部和社员想办法把它用来防治农作物的病虫害，红光社的干部和社员们受到很大启示和鼓舞。去年秋季红光人民公社建成后，就马上成立了农药厂，遵循着毛主席的指示，在省农业厅工作组的帮助下，研究用打破碗花花制造农药。经过多次室内外的试验，用打破碗花花和“青矾”两种原料，提炼出防治植物菌核病的特效药——红光杀菌杀虫剂。他们把这种药剂施在一块二亩四分大的油菜田里，同时把“洋”农药“赛力散”加石灰粉施在另一块一亩多的油菜田里，经过对比试验，证明效力相同，杀虫效率都达到百分之百。
    中共郫县县委很重视打破碗花花药剂的推广工作。到目前为止，已在红光社先后召开了三次现场会议，全县人民公社中队长以上干部二千多人，都参加过现场会，并学习了制造药剂的方法。他们一致认为“红光杀菌杀虫剂”取材方便、成本低、效果显著，值得大力推广。
    目前，正是打破碗花花生长期，郫县各地的打破碗花花一般已长到六、七寸高。全县有十六个公社队队都在制造“红光杀菌杀虫剂”。有的公社已经在菜田里施用这种药剂了。（附图片）
