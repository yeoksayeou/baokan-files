Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 3rd: The Rangoon "Burmese People's Daily" published an editorial today pointing out that the Tibetan rebellion "has been portrayed by interested parties as a 'Buddhist rebellion'," but "correctly viewed, there is no reason to worry that the actions taken by the Chinese authorities against the Tibetan rebels are actions taken against Buddhists or Buddhism itself."

This editorial calls on Buddhists to carefully observe the Tibetan rebellion, and emphasizes that "if one is not careful, many people are likely to be deceived by the active propaganda of Western bloc countries and other small countries that succumb to the Western bloc."

    “缅甸人报”评西藏叛乱事件
    要求佛教徒不上西方欺骗宣传的当
    新华社仰光3日电　仰光“缅甸人报”今天发表社论指出，西藏叛乱“被有关方面描绘成为‘佛教徒叛乱’”，但是“正确地看来，没有理由担心，中国当局对西藏叛乱分子所采取的行动，是对佛教徒或者佛教本身所采取的行动。”
    这篇社论要求佛教徒小心观察西藏的叛乱，并且强调说，“如果不小心，许多人很可能被西方集团国家和屈服西方集团的其它小国家的积极宣传所欺骗。”
