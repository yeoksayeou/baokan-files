Reading through a pile of exam papers, Cai Shulian, a professor in the Chemistry Department of Fudan University, could not hide her joy: the students' ability to understand and analyze the principles of analytical chemistry had improved significantly. Several papers, worthy of a score of four, were even completed by students who usually struggled with their studies. The teachers in the teaching group, sharing the same feeling as Mr. Cai, graded all the exam papers overnight on the day of the exam. Early the next morning, they posted a bulletin to all the second-year students of the Chemistry Department: "We are satisfied with your performance in this exam…." When the students saw the bulletin, they sincerely felt grateful and respectful to the teachers. Three small classes were considering who should receive the red flag for this period of study, because they were all so close in performance. But when someone suggested giving the red flag to the teachers, all the students in each class unanimously agreed. They said that one of the important reasons for the good results in this exam was that the teachers followed the mass line in teaching and further developed their leading role in teaching. Professor Cai Shulian accepted the red flag on behalf of the Analytical Chemistry Teaching and Research Group. She said: This is the victory of the Party's education policy. Now I am really beginning to understand the role and significance of the mass line in teaching.

Now, the second-year students of the Chemistry Department have finished studying Mr. Cai's course, but many students still go to Mr. Cai for consultation whenever they have time. They feel that Mr. Cai can seriously discuss the students' opinions. A new and lively relationship of mutual teaching and learning, respecting teachers and loving students, has begun to form between Mr. Cai and the students.

Speaking of this new relationship established with the students, Mr. Cai said sincerely: There is really nothing to it. The students like to associate with me simply because they know that I am willing to listen to their opinions and willing to discuss problems with them.

This is not so easy to do. Mr. Cai said: "In the past, I always felt that there would be no problems in my teaching. At first, when I heard students raise many opinions about teaching, I couldn't understand it. Was I teaching more and more confused? I even thought these opinions were deliberately making things difficult for me. So at that time, although I heard the opinions, I didn't cherish them."

"But in the great debate on teaching work, so many opinions were raised about our course all at once, which made my emotions fluctuate very strongly. I asked the Party group leader: Can I continue to teach this course? He replied: There are many things we should do in teaching that we haven't done! We don't know much about the students' learning situation. Besides, this is not just a matter for one teacher, we all have a responsibility."

"What to do? Do what the masses say. But this also won't work. Because this student raises this opinion, and that student raises that opinion, which opinion should I teach according to? This stumped me again."

Speaking of this, Professor Cai Shulian found the tortuous and complex thoughts at that time funny. She said: "This shows that I haven't understood the problem of taking the mass line in teaching. But I was afraid of raising opinions, so I simply didn't want to take much responsibility in teaching."

Later, Professor Cai Shulian went to the students to see how they were learning. The students' tenacious spirit of learning moved her and aroused her sense of responsibility in teaching. Her views gradually changed. She said: "The students' tenacious spirit of learning is rare in the past. The time for doing experiments has been shortened, but the quality has been improved, and redoing experiments is already an individual phenomenon. A student from a dockworker's background named Wang Zenggui has a poor foundation of knowledge, but he studies every question so carefully and deeply, and he also scored four points in analytical chemistry. This made her deeply feel that it is appropriate for students to make higher demands on teachers, and she also began to understand what students are asking teachers for."

At the same time, the questions raised by students to teachers in their studies are also becoming more and more weighty. Mr. Cai gave an example: Once, she talked about the enrichment of a certain rare metal by coprecipitation, and the students asked her: Can trace metal ions be enriched by coprecipitation? And they gave many examples one by one to ask for explanations. She told the students at the time that she needed to check the literature again to answer these questions. She said that this situation was rare in the past. In the past, students' questions generally did not go beyond the scope of notes. Now, after students have participated in labor by running factories, their horizons have been broadened, their understanding of problems has deepened, and their ability to combine theory with practice has been improved. So now, for a question-and-answer session, full preparation is needed in advance, while in the past, most of the time there was no preparation in advance.

"Isn't this mutual teaching and learning!" She concluded from this: In addition to teaching students, teachers can also get education from students. Therefore, the opinions raised by students must be carefully analyzed. She called this process the three-part movement of changing the teaching style: from not listening to opinions, to not refusing anyone, and finally to seriously treating students' opinions. Mr. Cai said: Now I understand that when encountering problems in teaching, we must rely on the Party organization and also find the masses.

At this time, Mr. Cai and some young teachers were already walking around in the student dormitories. She said that it was a bit awkward at first, and she always felt that she was not as popular as the young teachers. When young teachers arrived in the student dormitories, the students greeted them, asked questions, and were as close to each other as brothers and sisters. What about herself? The boundary between herself and the students was very clear. Why is this? After thinking for a long time, I found the answer: It is not enough to just run around among the students in form. We must treat the students' learning with full enthusiasm, do everything possible to teach the course well from the perspective of the students' learning, and be responsible for the students. At this time, Mr. Cai emphatically emphasized: The improvement of my own understanding bit by bit is due to the education of the Party organization. At the same time, in the teaching group, the young teachers reflected the students' opinions on the one hand, and analyzed these opinions on the other hand, which made her feel all the time that she was not teaching this course alone, but that there was a collective helping her and supporting her. Therefore, when the Party organization asked teachers to clearly recognize their leading role in teaching and to fully play this role, Mr. Cai said: This is to ask us to be conscientious and responsible in teaching, to do our best to teach well, and to enable students to learn well. How to do everything possible to teach the course well? So that students can learn well? In the past, Mr. Cai regarded teaching two lessons well as fulfilling his responsibility as a teacher. Now, she believes that relying solely on classroom lectures cannot fully reflect the leading role of teachers. She began to delve into all aspects of teaching, to tutor and answer questions for students, and to take students to do experiments. Sometimes she accompanied students to do experiments until late at night. She often discovered problems from tutoring and experiments, checked and summarized her teaching content, and absorbed students to participate in discussions on improving teaching content. In this way, she grasped all aspects of teaching, from beginning to end, and Mr. Cai was able to keep the quality of his course in mind and improve the quality of teaching, and thus he obviously felt his leading role. At the beginning of this semester, Mr. Cai spent half a day every day in the teaching and research group to tutor students. Because she had a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the students' learning situation, the quality of tutoring was also greatly improved.

It is the greatest comfort for teachers to see students learn well. Mr. Cai modestly said: The students' good learning is due to the good guidance of the Party, the high enthusiasm of the students for learning, and the specific and in-depth tutoring of the young teachers. She herself only did a small part of the work. She said: "Under the leadership and education of the Party, we must further play our leading role. In order to do this, we need to keep in mind the teachings of the Party: put politics in command, and continue to work hard to overcome our own individualism."

    师生　同志　朋友　
    中兴
    捧读着一份份考卷，复旦大学化学系教授蔡淑莲掩饰不住喜悦的心情：学生理解分析化学原理的能力显著提高了。有几份够上四分的卷子，竟是平日学习比较吃力的学生做出来的。教学小组的教师怀着和蔡先生同样的心情，就在考试的当天，连夜把全部试卷批改好。第二天一早，他们就给化学系二年级全体学生贴出一张喜报：“我们对你们这次考试成绩感到满意……。”学生看见了喜报，也由衷地产生了对教师的感谢与敬意。有三个小班正在考虑这次学习的红旗应该给谁的问题，因为评来评去都不相上下。可是当有人提议要把这面红旗送给教师时，各个班的学生都一致赞成。他们说，这次考试成绩好，重要原因之一是教师的教学走群众路线，进一步发挥了在教学中的主导作用。蔡淑莲教授代表分析化学教研组接受了这面红旗。她说：这是党的教育方针的胜利。现在我才真正开始体会到教学工作中群众路线的作用和意义。
    现在，化学系二年级学生已经结束了蔡先生的课程的学习，但是不少的学生一有空，还到蔡先生那里去请教，他们觉得蔡先生能够认真地讨论学生的意见。在蔡先生与学生之间，开始形成了新的生动的教学相长，尊师爱生的关系。
    提起这种与学生之间建立起的新关系，蔡先生诚挚地说：这实在没有什么。同学们喜欢和我来往，只是因为他们知道我愿意听他们的意见，愿意和他们一道讨论问题罢了。
    这也不是那么轻易就能做到的。蔡先生说：“过去总觉得自己在教学上不会有什么问题。一开始，听到学生对教学提出很多意见，我想不通，难道我教书越教越糊涂了？甚至认为这些意见是故意和我为难。所以那个时候虽然听到了意见，却并不珍视这些意见。”
    “但是在教学工作大辩论中，对我们课程的意见一下子提了那么多，这使我情绪波动得很厉害，就找党小组长问：我这个课还能不能再教下去？他回答我：我们教学上是有许多应该做的事情没有做呀！对学生的学习情况不大了解。再说，这也不是某一个教师的事，我们大家都有责任。”
      “怎么办？就照群众的意见办吧。但是，这也不成。因为这个学生提这样意见，那个学生又提那样意见，到底按谁的意见教呢？这，又把我难住了。
    谈到这里，蔡淑莲教授为当时的那种曲折复杂的想法感到好笑。她说：“这说明我对教学中要走群众路线的问题还没有通。但是又怕提意见，因此在教学上就索性不愿多负责任。”
    后来，蔡淑莲教授就到学生中间去，去看学生学习的情况。学生顽强的学习精神感动了她，也激起了自己在教学中的责任感，她的看法逐渐改变了。她说：“学生那种顽强学习精神是过去少见的。做实验的时间缩短了，但是质量却提高了，返工重做的实验已经是个别的现象了。有位码头工人出身的学生名叫王增贵，基础知识差，但他在学习中对每个问题都钻得那么细、那么深，分析化学也考了四分。这使她深深感到，学生对教师提出更高的要求是应当的，她也开始明白了学生对教师提意见究竟为了什么。
    同时，学生在学习上向教师提出的问题，也越来越有份量了。蔡先生举了一个例子：有一次，她讲某种稀有金属用共沉淀法富集，学生就问她：微量金属离子是否都可以用共沉淀法富集？并且一个一个地举出很多例子来要求说明。她当时告诉学生，需要再查查文献才好回答这些问题。她说，这种情形过去是少见的。过去学生的提问一般的越不出笔记的范围，现在学生经过办工厂参加劳动，眼界开阔了，对问题的理解深了，理论联系实际的能力都提高了。所以现在上一节答疑课，事先需要作充分的准备，从前多半是事前没一点准备的。
      “这不是教学相长吗！”她从这里得出结论：教师除了教学生外，还能从学生那里得到教益。因此，对待学生提出的意见，一定要认真分析。她把这一过程称作是教学作风转变的三部曲：从不听意见到来者不拒，最后是认真对待学生的意见。蔡先生说：现在我懂得了，教学上碰到问题，要依靠党组织，也要找群众。
    这时，蔡先生已经和一些青年教师到学生宿舍走动了。她说，开头有点别扭，总感到自己不像青年教师那么受欢迎。青年教师到了学生宿舍，学生打招呼、提问题，互相亲热得像兄弟姊妹一样。自己呢？与学生之间的界限很清楚。这是为什么？想了很久，才找到了答案：形式上到学生中跑跑还不行，必须满腔热情地对待学生的学习，从学生学习情况出发千方百计地把课教好，对学生负责。这时，蔡先生着重地强调：从我自己认识上一点一滴的提高，都是由于党组织的教育。同时在教学小组里，青年教师一面反映学生的意见，一面又分析这些意见，使她时时感到不是自己一个人在教这门课，有一个集体在帮助她、支持她。所以，当党组织要求教师明确地认识自己在教学上的主导作用和充分发挥这种作用的时候，蔡先生说：这是要我们在教学上认真负责，尽一切努力教得好，使学生学得好。怎样千方百计地把课教好？使学生学好？从前，蔡先生是把上好两节课当作是尽到了做教师的责任。现在，她认为单靠课堂讲课还不能完全体现教师的主导作用了。她开始深入教学的各个环节，到学生中去辅导、答疑，带学生做实验。有时陪同学生做实验到深夜。经常从辅导和实验中发现问题，检查总结自己的教学内容，并且吸收学生参加改进教学内容的讨论。这样，把教学各个环节都抓了起来，一竿子到底，蔡先生就能对自己的课程质量经常做到心中有数，提高了教学质量，因而也就明显地感到自己的主导作用了。本学期一开学，蔡先生每天抽半天时间在教研组里专门为学生辅导。由于全面深入地了解了学生的学习情况，辅导质量也就大大提高。
    学生学得好，这对于教师来说是最大的安慰。蔡先生谦虚地表示：学生学得好，是党教导得好，学生学习热情高，青年教师具体深入地进行辅导，她自己不过尽了很少的一分力量。她说：“在党的领导和教育下，要进一步发挥自己的主导作用。为了做到这样，需要牢记党的教导：政治挂帅，继续努力克服自己身上的个人主义。”
