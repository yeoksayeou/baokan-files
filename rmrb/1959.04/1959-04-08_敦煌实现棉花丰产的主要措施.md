    The Main Measures for Achieving High Cotton Yields in Dunhuang
    The CCP Dunhuang County Committee
    Dunhuang County is located at the westernmost end of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province, and has a long history of cotton cultivation. According to research, cotton cultivation began here more than a thousand years ago. However, before liberation, Dunhuang's cotton production, like other undertakings, was devastated, with the cotton planting area maintained at only about 10,000 mu, and the yield of ginned cotton per mu was only 30 to 40 jin.
    After liberation, under the strong leadership and support of Party committees at all levels, and through the efforts of the people of the county, cotton production developed rapidly. By 1957, the cotton planting area had expanded to more than 77,000 mu, and the yield per mu had risen to 105.5 jin, making it one of the five counties (cities) in the country with a yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Last year, the cotton planting area was expanded to over 90,000 mu, and the average yield per mu more than doubled. Many high-yield fields also appeared, with the highest yield reaching over 5,200 jin of seed cotton per mu. From this, it can be seen that the potential for cotton production in Dunhuang County is very large. As long as technology is continuously innovated, the yield will inevitably continue to leap forward.
    Based on local natural conditions and the characteristics of cotton production, we mainly focused on the two basic links of ensuring seedling emergence and promoting early maturity, and improved a series of yield-increasing technical measures:
        Land Preparation to Conserve Moisture
    Conserving moisture is an important key to ensuring seedling emergence. After the wheat harvest in the previous year, the land should be plowed to a depth of seven to eight inches in the autumn, turning and sun-drying the soil to increase soil weathering and create a suitable environment for cotton root development. For continuous cropping or stubble land, deep plowing should be carried out before the ground freezes. The land that has been plowed in autumn and winter should be irrigated with root-settling water in the spring, and harrowed with a chain harrow or a disc harrow to make it flat. Spring plowing should be avoided to prevent excessive loss of soil moisture, which is not conducive to seedling emergence. According to the investigation of the Second Production Team of the Hexi Brigade, the seedling deficiency rate of land plowed in autumn and harrowed in spring was 7.3%, while that of stubble root spring plowed land was 21.8%. This fully proves the superiority of autumn plowing. Before sowing, continuous operations of fine harrowing, fine raking, and fine leveling should be carried out to make the ground flat and fine. The corners of the ridges should also be harrowed and leveled to provide sufficient conditions for cotton seeds to emerge and ensure full seedling emergence. For land with salt spots, the masses' method of digging and leveling was used to basically eliminate the phenomenon of no seedlings due to salt spots.
    Timely Early Sowing, Close Planting, and Full Seedling Emergence
    The soil temperature in Dunhuang in mid-April can meet the needs of cotton seed development, and late frosts usually occur from late April to early May. In order to make full use of the growing season to avoid late frost damage, timely early sowing is necessary. The whole county generally starts sowing around the Grain Rain (谷雨) solar term and ends before the Beginning of Summer (立夏) solar term. All seeds used are the improved variety Si 3173, which have been selected by grain, and the sowing amount per mu is 20 to 25 jin. The sowing depth is generally between 1.2 inches and 1.8 inches, and all are implemented with strip sowing and equidistant close planting. The number of seedlings retained per mu is 9,000 to 12,000, with row spacing of 9 inches to 1 foot 1 inch, and plant spacing of 5 inches to 6 inches. Equidistant close planting not only increases the number of plants per unit area, but also makes the plants evenly distributed, with a suitable nutritional area, which can improve yield and early maturity.
      Early Seedling Determination, Frequent Cultivation
    After the cotton seedlings emerge and rows become visible, thinning and weeding should be carried out. When two or three true leaves have grown, seedlings should be determined according to plant spacing with a ruler and weeds should be removed. This can avoid overcrowding of cotton seedlings. Cultivation should be carried out immediately after thinning, to a depth of three to four inches. The second cultivation should be carried out when determining seedlings, to a depth of two to three inches. After the first irrigation, when the soil surface is slightly dry, cultivate again to a depth of 1.5 to 2 inches. After the second irrigation, shallow cultivation should be carried out for small cotton plants according to the growth and luxuriance of cotton plants in different plots, and the hard shell on the ground should be broken with a curved hoe for tall plants. Cotton fields need to be cultivated four to five times to keep the soil in a loose state at all times, which is conducive to root development in the early stage and moisture conservation and drought resistance in the later stage.
    Careful Topping and Pruning
    When a fruit branch appears on the cotton plant, "removing the trouser legs" should be carried out, that is, all buds and leaves below the first fruit branch should be removed. Then, according to the growth of the cotton plant, the top of the cotton plant should be removed before the Great Heat (大暑) and Beginning of Autumn (立秋) solar terms, leaving eight to ten fruit branches. Last year, the cotton growth in the whole county was particularly good, with many flower buds and large cotton plants. Therefore, in August, in Class 1 cotton fields, topping and removing redundant buds were carried out appropriately, and in September, the lower four or five old leaves were removed. Timely and careful pruning reduces cotton boll shedding, increases boll weight, and promotes early maturity.
    Small Irrigation, Frequent Fertilization
    During the cotton growing season, small irrigation and frequent watering were adopted to shorten the watering cycle and improve the irrigation effect. Last year, cotton fields were generally irrigated three times during the growing season: the first time was during the budding stage, with a ground water depth of two to three inches; the second time was during the peak flowering period, with a ground water depth of 1.5 to 2 inches; and the third time was during the peak boll-setting period, with shallow irrigation. Irrigation in the early stage was combined with fertilization to quickly exert the fertilizer effect. Generally, about 20,000 jin of base fertilizer (organic fertilizer and soil fertilizer) were applied per mu in cotton fields throughout the county. Many high-yield fields also applied 20 to 30 jin of superphosphate and ammonium sulfate before sowing. During the seedling determination period and the first two irrigations, 20 to 30 jin of fast-acting nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers were applied each time. Before the third irrigation, two to three foliar sprays of phosphorus were applied to Class 1 and 2 cotton fields, and 20 jin of soil fertilizer was applied to Class 3 cotton fields. A few cotton fields were also sprayed with ammonium acetate growth stimulant to protect bolls and increase boll weight. Generally, layered and multi-stage fertilization was achieved according to growth needs.
    Blocking at Every Stage, Preventing and Controlling Disasters
    The main disaster in Dunhuang County is frost. Local people have two prevention methods: one is to skip the frost period, that is, to estimate the late frost time according to data and seasonal conditions, determine the sowing time, so that the cotton can avoid frost before emergence; or to mix about 30% of dry seeds into the cotton seeds, these seeds emerge slowly, even if some of the first seedlings are frozen to death, they can continue to emerge later. The second is to avoid the initial frost by adopting the method of "not meeting each other", using timely cultivation, topping, removing old leaves, weeding, fertilizing, etc., to enhance frost resistance and promote early maturity, turning post-frost flowers into pre-frost flowers. For various diseases and insect pests with great harm, we have adopted the method of blocking at every stage, timely prevention, timely control, and timely elimination, so that various insect pests in cotton fields were basically eliminated last year.

    敦煌实现棉花丰产的主要措施
    中共敦煌县委会
    敦煌县位于甘肃省河西走廊最西端，有悠久的植棉历史。据考证，一千多年前这里就已开始种植棉花。但在解放前，敦煌的棉花生产和其它事业一样受到摧残，植棉面积仅维持在万亩左右，亩产皮棉仅三十斤到四十斤。
    解放后，在各级党委大力领导支持下，经过全县人民努力，棉花生产迅速发展。到1957年植棉面积扩大到七万七千多亩，亩产量上升到一百零五点五斤，成为全国五个百斤皮棉县（市）之一。去年植棉面积扩大为九万余亩，平均亩产量又翻了一番以上，其中还出现许多高额丰产田，最高的一块亩产籽棉五千二百余斤。由此可见，敦煌县的棉花生产潜力是很大的，只要不断革新技术，产量必然会不断跃进。
    根据当地自然条件和棉花生产特点，我们主要围绕保苗和促使早熟两个基本环节，改进了一系列的增产技术措施：
        整地保墒
    保墒是保苗的重要关键。在前一年麦田收获后，立即秋耕七到八寸，翻土晒土，以增加土壤的风化作用，给棉花根系发育创造适宜的环境。连作或谷槎地，要在冻前进行深翻；秋冬耕过的地块，要在春季灌上安根水，用耖耖地或用圆盘耙耙地，使其平整，春季不再耕翻，以避免土壤水分过多损失，不利于出苗。据河西大队二生产队的调查，秋耕春耙地的缺苗率为7.3％，而槎根春耕地为21.8％，这充分证明秋耕的优越性。播种前再进行一次细耖、细耙、细耱的连续作业，使地面达到平整细致，地埂四角也要力求耖到、耱到，为棉籽出土和保证全苗提供充分条件。有盐斑的地块，沿用群众挖补平整的方法，做到了基本消灭因盐斑而无苗的现象。
    适时早播、密植全苗
    敦煌土壤温度在4月中旬已能满足棉籽发育需要，晚霜均在4月下旬至5月上旬。为了充分利用生长期以躲过晚霜冻害，要适时早播。全县一般均在谷雨前后开始播种，立夏前结束。所用种子全部为斯3173号良种，并进行了粒选，每亩播种量二十到二十五斤，下种深度一般在一点二寸到一点八寸之间，并全部实行条播与等距密植。每亩地留苗株数分别在九千到一万二千株，行距九寸到一尺一寸，株距五寸到六寸。等距密植不但增加了单位面积株数，而且植株分布均匀，有适宜的营养面积，可提高产量和早熟。
      早定苗、勤中耕
    棉苗出土显行后即行间苗锄草，长出二三片真叶时，按株距以尺子定苗并锄草，这就能避免棉苗过于拥挤。间苗后紧接中耕，深至三、四寸。定苗时进行第二次中耕，深度二、三寸。头水后地皮稍干，再中耕一寸半到二寸，灌二水后，根据不同地块棉株生长繁茂情况，矮小的进行浅中耕，高大的用弯锄破碎地面硬壳。棉田共需中耕四至五次，使土壤始终保持疏松状态，以有利于前期根系发育和后期的保墒抗旱。
    细致进行摘心整枝
    棉株出现一根果枝后即行“脱裤腿”，即去掉第一果枝下的全部芽叶；再根据棉株生长情况，在大暑、立秋前分别先后打去棉株顶尖，留果枝八至十个。去年全县棉花生长特别良好，蕾铃多，棉株大，所以在8月中在一类棉田中，适当进行了打群尖摘赘芽工作，9月份又打去下部四、五片老叶。及时而细致地整株，减少了棉铃脱落，增加了铃重和促进早熟。
    小水勤灌、分次施肥
    棉花生长期灌溉采取了小水勤灌，从而缩短了轮水期距，提高灌水效果。去年棉田生长期一般灌了三水：第一次在现蕾期，地面水深二至三寸；第二次在开花盛期，地面水深一点五寸至二寸；第三次在结铃盛期，浅灌薄灌。前期灌水并与施肥相结合，使肥效迅速发挥。全县棉田一般每亩施基肥（有机肥料土肥）两万斤左右，不少丰产田播前并施入过磷酸钙和硫铵二、三十斤。在定苗期及灌头二次水时，每次均分别施入速效性氮磷化肥各二、三十斤。灌三水前，一、二类棉田根外喷磷二、三次，三类棉田追施土化肥二十斤，少数棉田还喷了一次乙酸铵生长刺激素，以保铃和增加铃重。一般都达到根据生长需要分层分次施肥。
    关关卡住、防治灾害
    敦煌县的灾害主要是霜冻。当地群众有两种防治方法：一是跳越霜冻期，即根据资料和季节情况估计晚霜时间，确定下种时间，使棉花在出苗前避过霜冻；或是在棉种内掺入约30％的干种籽，这些种子出苗慢，即使先出苗被冻死一部分，以后还可继续出苗。二是对初霜冻采用了“两不见面”的办法避开，用及时中耕打尖打老叶锄杂草施肥等办法，增强抗霜能力和促使早熟，变霜后花为霜前花。对危害性大的各种病虫害，采取了关关卡住及时防治及时消灭的方法，因而在去年基本消灭了棉田上的各种虫害。
