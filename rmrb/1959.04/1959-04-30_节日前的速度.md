Speed Before the Holiday
　　Jing Hua
　　Beijing presents a prosperous festive scene on the eve of "May Day".

　　The Tiananmen Gate tower has been renovated. Tiananmen Square, which was previously piled with many building materials, has been cleaned up, and electric lights have been installed on the Tiananmen Gate tower and nearby tall buildings. At night, the lights are brilliant, looking like a pearl palace from afar. The newly repaired East and West Chang'an Avenue, forty to fifty meters wide, is lined with green poplars, and brand-new red buses run smoothly on the flat roads. On "May Day," the parade will surge from Jianguomen directly to Tiananmen Square. On the evening of the 27th, more than 100,000 workers, cadres, students, and citizens sang and danced in the square to celebrate the election of the new national leaders. On May 1st, people will once again be reviewed here by Chairman Mao and his close comrades-in-arms.

　　Before "May Day", good news kept coming from various factories and mines: As of the 28th, more than 200 factories in the city had completed their April state plans ahead of schedule. The plans for pig iron, steel, and steel materials have also been completed two days ahead of schedule.

　　Workers at the No. 1 blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have developed measures such as expanding the use of marginal gas and promoting small-batch charging, and have vigorously attacked the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace, increasing it by more than 13% compared to last month. The workers of the Beijing Steel Plant are determined to overcome the difficulties of using earthy iron to refine good steel. Yesterday morning, the workers braved high temperatures and repaired an electric furnace in almost half the time allotted. The steelworkers are using such steely will to greet their holiday.

　　Workers at the Jingxi Coal Mine achieved more than 100 holiday gift indicators and measures in one week, and new records continue to appear. Workers at the Chengzi Mine are conducting competitions in the early, middle, and late shifts, with each shift leading the others. They are celebrating this universal holiday with outstanding achievements.

　　All employees of the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory have further discussed the conditions for competition between people and between groups. Mu Zhonghui, a model young worker in the factory, plans to complete four technical innovations in a few days. He made a tool for punching paper pads from waste materials, which increased efficiency tenfold. More than 700 workers at the Tongyi Water Pump Factory have become red banner bearers, each being equal to two, three, or five people, thanks to vigorous technical innovation. The outstanding work of the machinery workers has added a lot of glory to our holiday.

　　Many spinning frames in the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory are decorated with colorful silk. The female workers have taken Chen Ai'e, a fast yarn joining expert from the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, as their model and are learning from her. Some female workers even use rows of tender green cypress trees as spinning frames after work, walking between them to learn Chen Ai'e's touring experience. They are determined to participate in the "May Day" parade with excellent production results. When these girls, dancing with colorful ribbons, see our leaders in front of Tiananmen, how happy they will be!

　　The people of the capital are using rapid speed and outstanding achievements on the industrial and agricultural production fronts to welcome this joyous holiday.

    节日前的速度
    晶华
      “五一”前夕，北京呈现一片节日的繁荣景象。
    天安门城楼已被修饰一新。不久前还堆存许多建筑材料的天安门广场，已经清理干净，天安门城楼和附近的高大建筑物都安装了电灯。入夜灯火辉煌，远远看去，宛如珍珠宫殿一般，新修过的四、五十公尺宽的东西长安街旁栽满了绿色的白杨，红色的崭新的公共汽车在平坦的马路上畅通无阻地行驶。“五一”那天，游行队伍将由建国门直涌天安门广场。27日晚上，十万多工人、干部、学生和市民刚在广场上载歌载舞庆祝了新的国家领导人员的选出，5月1日，人们又将在这里接受毛主席和他的亲密的战友们的检阅。
      “五一”前，各厂矿不断地传来好消息：到28日为止，全市已有二百多个工厂提前完成了4月份国家计划。生铁、钢和钢材的计划也已提前两天完成。
    石景山钢铁公司第一高炉的工人们，钻研出发展边缘煤气、推行小批下料等措施，猛攻高炉利用系数，比上月提高了13％以上。北京钢厂工人们决心闯过吃土铁炼好钢的大关。昨天上午，工人们冒着高温，修好一座电炉的时间比规定时间快了将近一倍。钢铁工人们就是用这样的钢铁意志，来迎接自己的节日的。
    京西煤矿工人们，在一周中就实现了一百多件节日献礼指标和措施，新纪录不断出现。城子矿的工人们早班、中班、晚班开展竞赛，一班比一班领先。他们用出色的成就来庆贺这普天同庆的节日。
    第一机床厂全体职工，又深入讨论了人与人、组与组竞赛的条件。厂的标兵青年职工穆仲辉计划在几天中完成四项技术革新，他用废料制成冲纸垫的工具，效率提高了十倍。同益水泵厂工人，大搞技术革新当中，有七百多人成了一人顶二人、顶三人、顶五人的红旗手。机械工人的出色劳动，使我们的节日增添了不少的光辉。
    北京第二棉纺织厂的许多细纱机装饰上了彩绸。女工们把快速接头能手武汉棉纺一厂细纱女工陈爱娥，当成自己的标兵来学习，有的女工下班后，还把一排排嫩绿的小柏树当作细纱机，串行其间，学习陈爱娥的巡回经验。她们决心带着优异的生产成绩去参加“五一”游行。当这　些手舞彩霞的姑娘们，在天安门前，看到我们领袖的时候，她们将是多么开心啊！
    首都的人民，正在工农业生产战线上，用飞快的速度，用出色的成就，来迎接这个欢乐的节日。
