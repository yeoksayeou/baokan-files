Xinhua News Agency, Caracas: Workers at the Venezuelan branches of "U.S. Steel" and "Orinoco" mining companies recently went on strike to protest the company authorities' mistreatment of workers. Workers' representatives also accused the company of taking a "hostile attitude" towards their demands.

The "U.S. Steel Corporation" of the American Morgan Consortium, along with two other companies – "Bethlehem Steel Corporation" and "Republic Steel Corporation" – control all of Venezuela's iron mines, and most of the iron ore produced is shipped to the United States for steelmaking.

Bolivia
Xinhua News Agency, La Paz: Eight thousand tin miners in the Catavi region of Bolivia recently went on strike again, opposing the government's decision to partially abolish subsidies for mining area stores starting in April. Thanks to these subsidies, impoverished miners can buy food and clothing items for more than 30% cheaper than market prices.

The abolition of this subsidy was demanded by the American-controlled "International Monetary Fund" to the Bolivian government. It repeatedly threatened that unless the Bolivian government eliminates this "economic ill," it should forget about getting the organization's $26 million loan for this year.

Puerto Rico
Xinhua News Agency, San Juan: According to the "Justicia" newspaper on March 31, the strike by Puerto Rico Telephone Company workers demanding wage increases has disrupted telephone service in the country. The Telephone Company Workers Union is demanding wage increases and re-grading for workers. It is demanding that workers be paid during holidays and sick leave and be given medical benefits.

Chile
Xinhua News Agency, Santiago: Sixteen thousand coal miners in Lota, Coronel, Plegarias and other places in Chile continue to persist in their wage-increase strike, which has lasted for more than half a month. In order to support the coal miners' strike, all sectors of Chilean society established a committee last week dedicated to organizing and arranging moral and material support from the masses and various trade unions for the coal miners. It is reported that during the strike, seventeen workers' children have died due to hunger and lack of medical treatment.

Argentina
Xinhua News Agency, via TASS: Workers from ten trade unions in Argentina held a six-hour strike in the capital, Buenos Aires, on the 3rd to protest government interference in trade union affairs.

Strikers held a demonstration in the city center, demanding that the government release arrested trade union leaders, reinstate laid-off meatpacking workers, and increase wages. Strikers also shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism." The procession was attacked by three thousand police officers. Police rushed into the procession, attacking workers with tear gas and other weapons, leading to clashes with the workers.
