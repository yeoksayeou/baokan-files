　　Remembering Happiness Gully
　　Bing Xin
　　We, a dozen or so people, walked in a long line, carefully stepping on the ridges of the fields, towards what was once "Ghost Market Gully" and is now "Happiness Gully."

　　In Wenjia Village, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, there is such a long gully, filled with small graves. Even on clear, moonlit nights, people dared not pass through it, because this gully was a ghost market! Before liberation, it was a desolate and lonely place, rarely visited. People said that every night, in the deep darkness, ghostly figures vaguely floated, and faint, weeping ghost sounds could be heard. The name Ghost Market Gully spread.

　　Ghost Market Gully was where the dead of Wencun gathered, and the land where the living of Wencun lived and cultivated was also a place with "few trees, much sand, deep gullies, bald mountains, soft rocks, and loose soil!" "It rots one day when it rains, and is dry for three days after the rain." After mountain floods, soil and water were lost, cultivated land decreased year by year, and the river became larger year by year, but water for drinking and use had to be fetched from more than ten miles away. Every year there was either drought or flood, and no grain was harvested. Before liberation, the number of people who fled famine accounted for about 80% of the total population. Wencun has many folk songs, which are records of the painful lives of the local people in the past.

　　Wencun land, chaotic mountain ridges
　　Apply manure every year, wash away every year,
　　If you don't apply manure for one season, it's hard to harvest enough seeds
　　Plant crops every season, never harvest every year.

　　This poor and remote place, and the painful years, affected the thirty-four men in the local Nangou Village, thirty-two of whom could not find partners. One family with five brothers had four without wives, and another family with seven girls had five willing to go down the mountain! Wencun also has a folk song that says:

　　Don't marry a daughter to Wencun Village,
　　Sandy ridge cannot become rich,
　　Mountains are poor, gullies are deep, there is no water,
　　Drinking water from deep wells breaks the tendons,
　　The land is far, the slopes are large, sandy beaches,
　　Going to the fields wears out the heels,
　　No harvest every year due to drought and flood,
　　Drinking water still has to be sought far away,
　　If you want to live a good life,
　　Unless you move away from Wencun.

　　For many years, the people of Wencun had this idea: "There is so much water here when it rains, it would be so good if we could store it up and use it!" The masses of Wencun are hardworking and courageous and wise, but before the leadership of the Party, the courage and wisdom of the people, like soil and water, were lost with the mountain floods every year!

　　After liberation, Wencun, like a withered tree meeting spring, sprouted on every dry branch. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, cadres and the masses launched a arduous struggle against nature. From 1949 to 1954, the area of irrigated land was expanded from the previous two hundred and eighty mu to five hundred and ninety mu. Although this number was not small, the masses and cadres felt that the progress was not fast enough, and the problem of drinking water was not completely solved. A leading cadre said: "At that time, anyone who poured out their face-washing water while working locally was considered to be detached from the masses." Because water was so difficult to obtain and precious locally, a basin of water was used by the mother-in-law, then the daughter-in-law and son, then the grandchildren, and finally left to mix with coal!

　　Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, coupled with the people's communization, under the leadership of the Party, the development of water conservancy work in Wencun was like a trapped dragon, happily awakening on a spring night with thunder and rain, shaking off the muddy shallows, and flying to the sky with shimmering scales! The work of harnessing mountains and rivers began vigorously. They pooled their efforts, collected years of experience fighting mountain floods, and planned and acted simultaneously to "cut through the head of Mount Song and block the Ying River!" In the two months of last spring, four projects and thirty-seven kinds of soil and water conservation works were built on the high slopes of the mountain, closely integrated with promoting agricultural production, building and using them at the same time. In the past year, thirty reservoirs, more than sixty large canals, and more than one thousand valley dikes have been built. Eleven mountain tops have been harnessed, more than 300,000 cubic meters of earth and stone have been excavated, and the irrigated area has been expanded to more than 20,000 mu. The masses have poems to describe their soaring enthusiasm and the results of their labor:

　　Red flags fluttering all over the mountains,
　　People like the sea and the mountains everywhere.
　　Bright lights at night,
　　Sky-high enthusiasm during the day.

　　High mountains are green again,
　　Mountain valley reservoirs are sparkling,
　　Taming dragons and subduing tigers change the face,
　　Celebrate the harvest twice a year.

　　Combined with soil and water conservation, forestry in Wencun has also made great progress. Now there are more than 520 mu of gardens, 510 mu of nurseries, and 6.3 million trees. The masses have poems saying:

　　Engineering and afforestation go hand in hand,
　　Become a treasure after three years,
　　Clear water flows everywhere,
　　Fruit bumps into you on the road.

　　Now, the "Happiness Gully" that we are rushing to is transformed from the "Ghost Market Gully" of thousands of disasters!

　　I was excitedly thinking about the transformation of Wencun, while bowing my head and walking quickly. The girl beside me, with cheeks as red as ripe apples, smiled and stopped me, saying: "Walk slower, look, Happiness Gully is ahead!"

　　Looking up, in the middle of the green terraced fields on both sides, there is a winding valley. Layers of valley dikes divide this valley into dozens of "steps," planted with dense small trees. At this time, the peaches are in bloom, and the willows are budding. Under the brilliant sunshine, the mountains and valleys are filled with overflowing spring! Within a year or two, it really will be "clear water flowing everywhere, fruit bumping into you on the road," and "Ghost Market Gully" will become a forgotten name!

　　This apple-faced girl helped me walk all the way up to the head of the Happiness Gully canal on the top of the mountain, pointing out to me: the stone pool below the canal head, three or four feet square, is a stilling basin, which is to prevent the soil in the valley from being washed away when mountain floods rush down. In the small ditches extending from both sides of the stilling basin, rows of stones are arranged at short intervals, which are called "ditch waistbands"; on the slopes of the fields, there are diagonal earthen ridges, which are called "earth pockets," all to prevent soil erosion. In addition, there are fish-scale pits, contour lines, etc., which I couldn't understand or remember clearly. These small pieces of water storage, like thousands of mirrors, shimmer in the sun. I thought: After the plan of "thousands of reservoirs and ten thousand dikes" is completed, I don't know how much more beautiful the entire territory of Wencun will be!

　　Reluctantly, we left Happiness Gully, walked down the high slope, and crossed the dry riverbed to visit the Yuejin Canal, which was under construction. On the dam, people were carrying soil and tamping, the crowd was like the sea, and the cheers shook the earth! I took the hand of the big girl and said with a smile: "You wouldn't want to marry down the mountain, would you!" She shook her head with a smile, but pointed to the women in red clothes and red pants in the crowd of tamping workers, and said: "Those are all brides from our village, who came to work on the dam the day after they got married!" As she spoke, her eyes flashed with joy and pride…

　　Looking at her face, a spring-like feeling of gratitude surged in my heart. Like the people of Wencun, I am grateful for the great and correct leadership of the Party. I am even more grateful to our dear Party and the masses of Wencun for allowing me to see that the masses closely united around the Party are an invincible force in the world!

　　记幸福沟
　　冰心
    我们十几个人，排成长长的队伍，小心地踩着田垅，向着从前的“鬼集沟”，现在“幸福沟”走去。
    在河南省登封县文家村，有这么一条长长的山沟，沟里尽是一座座小小的坟头，就是月白风清之夜，人们也不敢从那里经过，因为这条沟是个鬼集！解放前，是个荒凉寂寞，人迹不到的地方。人们传说：天天夜里，沉沉的夜色之中，恍惚浮动着的幢幢的鬼影，隐约听到了如泣如诉的鬼声。鬼集沟的名字就传开了。
    鬼集沟是文村死人聚居之所，而文村的活人所居住耕种的，也是一片“林少沙多，沟深山秃，石软土松”的土地！“有雨一天烂，雨后三天旱”，山洪过后，水土流失，耕地逐年减少，河水逐年变大，吃水用水却要到十几里外去取。每年非旱即涝，颗粒不收，解放前，出外逃荒的人数，在总人口的80％左右。文村有不少的歌谣，都是本地人民对于从前痛苦生活的记载。
    文村地，乱山垅
    年年上粪年年冲，
    一季不上粪，难以收够种
    季季种庄稼年年没收成。
    这个穷僻的地方，痛苦的年月，影响到本地南沟村里三十四个男子，有三十二个找不到对象。有一家弟兄五人，有四个没有妻子，另一家有七个姑娘，却有五个愿意下山！文村又有歌谣说：
    有女不嫁文家村，
    砂岭不能发富根，
    山穷沟深没有水，
    吃水井深累断筋，
    地远坡大沙石滩，
    上地磨烂脚后跟，
    年年旱涝无收成，
    吃水还得远处寻，
    要想日子过得好，
    除非搬家离文村。
    多少年来，文村的人民个个都有这个想法：“这里一下雨就有那么多的水，若能把这些水存起来用，那够多好！”文村群众是刻苦耐劳的，也有勇气和智慧，但是在没有党的领导以前，人民的勇气与智慧，也像水土一样，年年随着山洪流失了！
    解放后的文村，像枯木逢春一样，每一条干枝上都发了芽，在共产党的正确领导下，干部和群众一起向大自然展开艰苦的斗争，从1949年到1954年，把水浇地从以前的二百八十亩，扩大到五百九十亩，这数目虽然不小，但群众和干部都认为进展得不够快，而且社社分开，吃水用水问题，也没有彻底解决，有一位领导干部说：“那时在当地工作的，谁要把洗脸水泼掉，他就是脱离群众。”因为水在当地是那样地艰难宝贵，群众的一盆水公婆洗过，媳妇儿子洗，孙儿孙女洗，最后还留下和煤呢！
    1958年大跃进以来，再加上人民公社化，在党的领导下，文村水利工作的发展，又像一条困龙，在雷雨交加的一个春夜，欣然醒起，摆脱了泥泞的浅沼，鳞甲闪耀地飞上了九天！治山治水的工作，雄壮浩荡地开始了。他们群策群力，收集起积年和山洪搏斗的经验，边规划边行动地“砍破嵩山头，挡住颍河流！”去年春天的两个月之中，在山顶高坡上修了四项三十七种水土工程，密切地结合着推进着农业生产，边兴修边利用，一年来兴修了三十个水库，六十多个大渠，一千多个谷坊。治理山头十一个，挖土石方三十多万方，扩大灌溉面积到两万多亩。群众有诗歌描写他们冲天的干劲，和他们劳动的成果：
    满山红旗招展，
    遍地人海人山。
    夜间灯火辉煌，
    白天干劲冲天。
    高山青又青，
    山谷水库亮晶晶，
    降龙伏虎改面貌，
    一年两季庆收成。
    结合着水土保持，文村的林业也有了很大的发展，现在已经有园林五百二十多亩，育苗五百一十亩，树木六百三十万棵。群众有诗说：
    工程造林一齐搞，
    三年以后变成宝，
    清水遍地流，
    行路果碰头。
    现在我们这些人急忙奔赴的“幸福沟”，就是从那千灾百难的“鬼集沟”转变而成的！
    我心里激动地在思索着文村的转变，一面低头快快地走。身旁那个脸蛋红得像熟透了的大苹果一样的姑娘，笑着拉住我说：“慢点走吧，你看，前面就是幸福沟了！”
    抬头望时，在两旁绿油油的梯田中间，有一条弯弯曲曲的山谷，一层一层的谷坊，把这道山谷分成几十层“台阶”，上面种的密密的小树，这时桃正开花，柳正萌芽，在灿烂的阳光下，满山满谷，弥漫着盈盈的春意！一两年内，真是“清水遍地流，行路果碰头”，“鬼集沟”成了被忘却的名字了！
    这个苹果脸的大姑娘搀住我，一路走上山顶幸福沟的渠头，指点给我看：渠头下面三四尺见方的石池是消力池，是防止山洪冲下的时候，把谷里的土冲走的。消力池两边引伸出去的小沟里，相隔不远就排着一行一行的石块，那叫做“沟腰带”；坡地上的田地里，斜斜地一道道的土畦，那叫做“土布袋”，都是防止水土流失的。此外还有鱼鳞坑，水平线等等，我也听不懂记不清了。这一小块一小块的蓄水，像千百面明镜一般，在阳光下闪烁，我想：等到“千库万坊”的计划完成以后，文村的全境更不知如何美丽呢！
    我们恋恋不舍地离开幸福沟，走下高坡，穿过干涸的河床，去参观正在筑坝的跃进渠，大坝上挑土的，打夯的，人山人海，欢声动地！我拉着那个大姑娘的手，笑说：“你不会想嫁到山下去了吧！”她笑着摇了摇头，却指给我看打夯的人丛中的几个穿红衣和穿红裤的妇女，说：“那几个都是我们村里的新娘子，都是结婚的第二天就上坝来工作的！”她说着眼里闪着欢乐和自豪的光气……
    我看着她的脸，心头涌起一股清泉似地感谢的情感，我和文村的人民一样，感谢党的伟大正确的领导，我更感谢我们的亲爱的党和文村的群众，让我看到了紧密团结在党的周围的群众，是天地间战无不胜的力量！
