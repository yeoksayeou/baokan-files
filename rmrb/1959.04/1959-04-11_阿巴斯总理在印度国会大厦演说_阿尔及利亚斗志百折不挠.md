　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 9th: Algerian Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas, while addressing Indian Congress Party parliamentarians at the Indian Parliament building this afternoon, emphasized the Algerian people's unyielding determination to fight against French colonialists.

　　He also stated that he is willing to hold talks with de Gaulle as a leader of the Algerian people, on equal terms.

　　Prime Minister Abbas briefly narrated the heroic and glorious liberation war that the Algerian people have been waging against French colonial rulers. He accused the French authorities of declaring Algeria a province of mainland France and portraying the Algerian national liberation war as a "rebellion." He hoped that the Indian people and government would help the Algerian people morally and materially.

　　Prime Minister Abbas called on India to recognize the Algerian Provisional Government. He believes that failure to recognize the Algerian Provisional Government will encourage the French government to declare to the world that they are merely suppressing "rebels." Prior to this, Prime Minister Abbas and his entourage had held talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the 8th.

　　阿巴斯总理在印度国会大厦演说
    阿尔及利亚斗志百折不挠
    新华社新德里9日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯今天下午在印度国会大厦向印度国大党议员发表演说时强调了阿尔及利亚人民百折不挠地同法国殖民主义者进行战斗的决心。
    他还说，他愿意在平等的条件上，以阿尔及利亚人民领袖的身份同戴高乐举行会谈。
    阿巴斯总理扼要叙述了阿尔及利亚人民为反对法国殖民统治者一直在进行的英勇的和光荣的解放战争。他指责法国当局宣布阿尔及利亚是法国本土的一个省，并且把阿尔及利亚民族解放战争说成是“叛乱”。他希望印度人民和政府在道义上和物质上帮助阿尔及利亚人民。
    阿巴斯总理呼吁印度承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府。他认为，不承认阿尔及利亚临时政府将鼓励法国政府向世界表白，他们只是在镇压“叛乱分子”。在这之前，阿巴斯总理和他的随行人员曾在8日同印度总理尼赫鲁进行了会谈。
