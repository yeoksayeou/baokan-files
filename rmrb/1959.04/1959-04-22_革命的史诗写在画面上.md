The "Hungarian Revolutionary Art Exhibition" deeply impressed me: the suffering and unyielding struggle of the Hungarian people during those stormy years were never overlooked by Hungarian artists; rather, they passionately transformed those moving poems into vivid and powerful artistic images. Hungarian artists have fulfilled their historical responsibility and created brilliant art worthy of that era.

These artworks, due to their profound ideological content and excellent artistic techniques, have left us with unforgettable impressions.

Derkovics Gyula, an outstanding painter from the working class, was not defeated by a lifetime of painful torment in his revolutionary will and artistic talent. His art was born in the flames of revolution; a crystallization of revolutionary enthusiasm and genius. The "1514" series is a set of inspiring woodcuts. With bursting passion and powerful expressive techniques, the artist depicted the famous peasant uprising in Hungarian history in 1514. The peasant masses unleashed a surging revolutionary torrent in order to break free from the shackles of slavery. Their unstoppable anger and fighting will are fully expressed in the pictures. This series was once held high during a mass demonstration on September 1, 1930. After seeing the original propaganda posters displayed at the exhibition, it is not difficult to imagine the enormous mobilizing role this work played among the masses at that time.

Hungarian artists are keen to use the genre of series, in the form of prints, to express famous revolutionary struggles in history. Everyone should remember the darkness and terror that the counter-revolutionary events of October 1956 brought to the Hungarian people - a painful lesson that should never be forgotten. Artists naturally did not abandon such an important theme, and we saw Erik Sandor's "Souvenir Series" and Vári Zoltán's "October 23, 1956" series, both on the subject of the October events. These images are true records of a shocking history; a poem of blood, tears, and heroic struggle of the revolutionary Hungarian people. If we look at these two series in conjunction with Kadar György's "Concentration Camp Series" and Uitz Béla's "General Ludd Series," people will clearly understand what the imperialist fascist bandits have brought to the peace-loving people of the world. Naturally, works that sharply expose the insidious and ugly faces of these international murderers with sharp artistic images can also include the names of many other artists at the exhibition, such as Nyári Lóránt, Szinte Gábor, Bíró Mihály, and Szalay Lajos.

The scope of so-called "revolutionary art" certainly does not only mean limiting the subject matter to directly depicting revolutionary struggles. Those who have mastered the weapons of revolutionary struggle or who have been ideologically armed by the revolution, and even kind people who are unwilling to be slaves and oppressed by the rulers, depicting their work, labor, and even the minutiae of daily life, if handled skillfully by artists, will also appear to have revolutionary significance. Hungarian artists, due to their wide range of subjects and diverse expressive techniques, make this exhibition even more rich and colorful.

Fényes Adolf's "Mother" depicts the noble maternal love of a poor woman. With a compact structure and concise and fluent artistic language, the author expresses the inseparable and intimate feelings of a mother and child depending on each other, and expresses deep sympathy for the characters he depicts. Rudnay Gyula's "Fugitives" depicts a turbulent scene. The author uses the effect of light to express the tense and terrified expressions of the agitated crowd, forming a turbulent and tragic atmosphere on the screen. Kernstok Károly's "Orator in the Factory Canteen" is a complete composition with careful consideration. This artist is known for his ability to gain insight into people's psychological activities and portray character traits. We might as well pay attention to the eyes of the two workers with bare upper bodies who are so engrossed and determined when facing the agitator in a group of characters, and how their different positions and identities are so distinct compared to the well-dressed person who is hesitating.

This exhibition allows us to see the history of the Hungarian people's struggle; to appreciate the talents of Hungarian artists, especially their spirit of closely linking art to the people and the reality of revolutionary struggle, and their superb skills in portraying characters, which Chinese artists should be very grateful for.

    革命的史诗写在画面上
    王琦
    看了“匈牙利革命艺术展览会”，我深深地感到：匈牙利人民在风暴岁月里的苦难经历和坚强不屈的斗争，始终没有从匈牙利艺术家的视野和笔下疏忽过去，恰好是被他们以那样激动的心情，把那些感人的诗篇转化成为生动有力的艺术形象。匈牙利艺术家已经担负了他们应尽的历史责任，创造了无愧于那个时代的光辉的艺术。
    这些艺术作品，由于它深刻的思想内容和卓越的艺术技巧，给我们留下了难以忘却的印象。
    德柯维奇·久拉是一位出身自劳动人民的杰出的画家，一生痛苦的折磨并没有挫折他的革命意志和艺术才能。他的艺术是在革命的烈火中产生的；是革命热情和天才的结晶。“1514”组画是激动人心的一套木刻画。艺术家以迸发的热情和强有力的表现手法，表现了1514年匈牙利历史上著名的农民起义。农民群众为了挣脱奴役的锁链而掀起了汹涌澎湃的革命怒潮。他们的不可阻挡的愤怒情绪和战斗意志，都从画面上充分地表现出来。这套组画在1930年9月1日的群众示威游行中，曾经被人们高举着前进。看了展览会上陈列的宣传画的原作，不难想见这件作品在当时广大群众中是发挥了怎样巨大的鼓动作用。
    匈牙利艺术家乐于运用组画的体裁，以版画的形式来表现历史上有名的革命斗争事件。大家应该记得1956年10月反革命事件给匈牙利人民带来的黑暗与恐怖这是令人永世难忘的惨痛教训。艺术家自然不会放弃这样重要的主题，以十月事件为题材的作品，我们看到有艾克·山道尔的“纪念品组画”和伐里·佐尔丹的“1956年10月23日”组画。这些画面是惊心动魄的历史的真实记录；是匈牙利革命人民的血泪与壮烈的诗篇。如果把这两套组画和卡达尔·久吉的“集中营组画”和乌以慈·贝拉的“卢德将军组画”联系起来一看，人们便非常清楚地了解帝国主义法西斯匪徒们给全世界和平人民究竟带来些什么。自然，以尖锐的艺术形象来戳穿这些国际杀人犯的阴险丑恶面目的作品，还可以举出展览会上其他许多艺术家如倪亚里·洛兰、幸茨·久拉、毕洛·米哈依、沙拉·狄波尔那些可敬的名字。
    所谓“革命艺术”的范围，当然不只意味着在题材上限制在直接描写革命的斗争。那些掌握了革命斗争武器或是在思想上经过革命武装的人民、甚至是不甘受统治者的奴役和压迫的善良人士，描写他们的工作、劳动、以及日常生活的细微末节，如果经过艺术家巧妙的处理，也会显得具有革命的现实意义。匈牙利艺术家由于其广泛的取材和多方面的表现手法，使这个展览会更显得丰富多彩。
    芬涅·阿道芬的“母亲”，描写了贫苦妇人的崇高母爱，作者以紧凑的结构、简洁流畅的艺术语言，表现了母子相依为命的不可分离的亲密感情，并对他所描写的人物寄予了深厚的同情。鲁德那伊·居拉的“逃亡者”是描绘一个动乱的场面，作者运用了光的效果来表达那些骚动人群的紧张恐怖的表情，画面上形成了一股动荡不安的悲惨的气氛。克恩斯多尔·卡洛伊的“在工厂食堂里的鼓动者”，是经过了严密构思的完整的构图。这位艺术家是以善于洞察人物心理活动和刻划性格特征著称的，我们不妨留心一下在面对着鼓动者的一组人物中，两个裸着上身的工人那样入神和意志坚定的目光，和那个衣冠楚楚的正在犹豫不决的人物比起来，他们之间不同的地位和身份，不正是那样截然分明么？
    这个展览会使我们看到匈牙利人民的斗争历史；欣赏到匈牙利艺术家们的才能，特别是他们那种使艺术紧密联系人民、联系革命斗争现实的精神和刻划人物的高超技巧，这是中国美术家们应该十分感谢的。
