Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives,
    I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, and I agree with the various reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I support the State Council's order to quell the rebellion in Tibet, and I resolutely oppose the collusion between British imperialism and Indian expansionists in interfering in China's internal affairs. Their conspiracies and intrigues have already failed under the strong unity of all ethnic groups in our country. If they dare to continue interfering in our internal affairs, they will surely suffer a bloody nose and suffer even greater failures.
    At the opening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, Chairman Mao taught us: "The people of our country should work hard, diligently learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, be honest and diligent, encourage and help each other, refrain from any exaggeration or pride, and prepare to build our current economically and culturally backward country into a great industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture within a few five-year plans." Chairman Mao's instruction profoundly educated us and gave the people of the whole country tremendous encouragement and strength. Now, although it is only the second year of the Second Five-Year Plan, as the Premier's report says, our country has undergone a series of historically significant changes and has achieved extremely brilliant achievements in both socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    In recent years, the people of Anhui have followed Chairman Mao's instructions and made unremitting efforts to change Anhui's backwardness as quickly as possible, and the achievements have been great. Despite the fact that Anhui suffered two years of heavy floods, one year of severe drought, and severe pests and diseases during the First National People's Congress, under the correct leadership and strong support of the Central Committee, and through the arduous struggle of the people of the province, the various production and construction undertakings have still developed relatively rapidly, especially the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, which greatly exceeded the previous few years. In 1958, we overcame the rare drought and severe pests and diseases and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The province's grain output reached 42 billion jin, an increase of more than 70 percent compared with the prosperous year of 1957; cotton output reached 2.83 million dan, an increase of nearly two times compared with 1957; compared with the output before liberation in 1948, grain increased 3.8 times and cotton increased 10.7 times. The Great Leap Forward in agriculture powerfully promoted the Great Leap Forward in industry. Last year, the total industrial output value reached 4 billion yuan, an increase of 1.6 times compared with 1957 and more than 13 times compared with 1948. The absolute figure of the annual increase was equivalent to 1.1 times the total increase in the previous nine years. The proportion of industrial output value in the total output value of industry and agriculture has reached 33 percent. The total investment in industrial capital construction throughout the year was more than half as much as the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period.
    In short, after several years of efforts, especially the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our province has not only laid a good foundation in agriculture, but also greatly changed the original extremely backward face in industry. Here, I would like to focus on reporting on the development of industry in Anhui.

    Anhui's modern industry has grown from scratch, with continuous improvement in output and quality, and continuous increase in product types.
    Before liberation, Anhui had virtually no modern industry except for two or three bureaucratic capitalist enterprises with outdated equipment and backward management. The few private factories were dilapidated, mainly operated by hand, and had very low production efficiency. According to statistics in 1949, the annual output value of the province's industry was only more than 200 million yuan, and the annual output of several major industrial products was: only 1.14 million tons of raw coal, only 24 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, only 1,900 pieces of cotton yarn, and only 32,000 tons of edible oil. After several years of construction, especially the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the face of industry in Anhui has undergone tremendous changes. By the end of 1958, there were more than 8,600 state-owned factories and mines in the province, with a total of more than 1.09 million employees. In the second half of last year, the province's rural areas realized the communization of the people, and the movement of the whole people to run industry formed a magnificent situation. The people's communes not only extracted a large number of laborers to support the national industrial construction, but also directly established more than 250,000 various small factories and mines. The achievements of the whole people in running the steel industry were even more prominent. From September last year, in just five months, more than 1,100 small blast furnaces of 8 cubic meters or more and more than 630 small steel converters were built. Last year, the province produced 130,000 tons of steel and 1.07 million tons of iron, and the product quality has always maintained a good level. Under the policy of "taking steel as the key link," other industrial sectors have also developed greatly, forming a situation of "overall leap forward." The output of machinery in this year reached 33,000 tons, the output of raw coal reached 8.66 million tons, the output of electricity reached 419 million kilowatt-hours, the output of cotton yarn reached 98,800 pieces, and the output of edible oil reached 130,000 tons. Compared with 1957, the output of several major industrial products increased 56 times for steel, 4 times for iron, 3.4 times for machinery, 0.7 times for raw coal, 1.1 times for electricity, 1.1 times for cotton yarn, and 1.5 times for edible oil. Compared with 1949, raw coal increased 6.5 times, electricity increased 16 times, cotton yarn increased 50 times, and edible oil increased more than 3 times. Products such as steel, iron, and machine tools could not be produced at all in 1949.
    The development of industry is not only reflected in output, but also in product types and quality. In recent years, the output and variety of industrial products in Anhui have increased year by year. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many new products were successfully trial-produced. Now our province can not only produce a considerable amount of light industrial products to meet the needs of the people's lives, but also produce machine tools, mining machinery, metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, agricultural machinery, etc., providing equipment for industrial and agricultural production and capital construction. Last year, most of the equipment used to build so many small blast furnaces in our province was produced by the province's machinery industry.
    The great achievements we have made on the industrial front in 1958, like other fronts, are fundamentally the result of conscientiously implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies on the basis of the great victory of the nationwide rectification movement.
    In 1959, under the unified plan of the state, in addition to striving to complete the targets of 60 billion jin of grain, 4.2 million dan of cotton, and other items in agriculture, the main production targets in industry are: 1.8 million tons of pig iron, 230,000 tons of steel, 16 million tons of coal, 710 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, 170,000 pieces of cotton yarn, and more than 210,000 tons of edible oil. Compared with last year's actual results, iron increased by 68.1 percent, steel increased by 76.9 percent, coal increased by 84.7 percent, electricity increased by 69.4 percent, cotton yarn increased by 72 percent, and edible oil increased by 61.5 percent. On the surface, the percentage increase in some industrial production this year is smaller than last year, but the absolute increase is even greater than last year, because the industrial base has expanded more than in the past. On this new basis, each 1 percent increase this year contains a much larger absolute number than last year. Taking pig iron as an example, each 1 percent increase last year was equivalent to an increase of 2,090 tons, while this year each 1 percent increase is an increase of 10,700 tons. Therefore, we say that this year's industrial production targets are still Great Leap Forward targets. In order to accelerate socialist construction and strive to fundamentally change the face of Anhui after a few years of hard work, such a leap forward target is completely necessary, and from a subjective and objective point of view, it is completely possible to complete this target. This year we have many more favorable conditions than last year, such as: the broad masses of people have received a profound education in the general line and have been encouraged by the Great Leap Forward last year, and their enthusiasm is even higher; after the Great Leap Forward last year, the material and technical conditions for developing industrial production in our province have been initially improved; there is also more experience in industrial production and construction; especially, the people's communes throughout the province have been further consolidated and developed after rectification, and they are not only the main reliance for developing agriculture, but also an important guarantee for developing industry. As long as we give full play to these favorable conditions and strengthen subjective efforts, this year's production targets can be completed and overfulfilled. The situation in the first quarter of this year in implementing the plan is good. Compared with the same period last year, the total industrial output value increased by 1.5 times, the amount of capital construction work increased by 0.7 times, the output and quality have been significantly improved, and the types of products have also been continuously increasing. The labor productivity of industry has increased by 5.4 percent compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Of course, the production targets in the first quarter were not fully and evenly completed by some units, and even the plan was not completed, but from the overall point of view, it is an overall leap forward. Looking at the whole year from the first quarter, we have full reason to draw an optimistic conclusion on completing this year's plan.

    Overcome difficulties such as insufficient raw materials and technical strength, and advance victoriously
    But this does not mean that completing this year's plan does not require overcoming any difficulties. Difficulties still exist, and the difficulties of insufficient raw materials, tight transportation, and insufficient technical strength are still the most prominent problems at present. These difficulties are temporary difficulties in the course of advancement, and they are better than the difficulties encountered in the large-scale steel production last year. In the second half of last year, we completed such arduous capital construction and production tasks in the steel industry in a short period of time under the condition of weak industrial base. At that time, the difficulties were more and greater than this year. However, the difficulties did not scare us, but were overcome one by one. For example, if there are insufficient raw materials, we will concentrate and save use, first ensuring the needs of key projects and major aspects, while general projects and secondary things will use substitutes, and massively increase the production of various possible raw materials, such as refractory materials, ore, coal, coke, wood, etc. In this way, the needs of the construction of more than 12,700 cubic meters of blast furnaces and other production and construction were basically solved. Tight transportation, in addition to paying attention to the layout of industrial bases in terms of raw materials and transportation, and shortening transportation distances as much as possible, we also strengthened the planning of transportation work, accelerated the turnover rate of vehicles and ships, vigorously carried out technological reform movements in transportation, mobilized the masses to reform and manufacture various transportation tools, and vigorously built roads and dredged waterways, thereby greatly improving transportation capacity and transportation efficiency. In the fourth quarter of last year alone, the province's road and shipping freight volume reached 7.84 million tons, accounting for nearly half of the annual freight volume. This spring, we rectified transportation, and transportation became more rational. Insufficient technical strength, we adopted methods such as on-site training, short-term training, master-apprentice system, old-new system, and rapid training to train more than 100,000 technical workers in a short period of time and expand the technical team; and adopted the method of leading by leading cadres, mobilizing the masses, and combining cadres, workers, and technicians to run "experimental fields" on a large scale, carry out technological innovation, combine foreign and local methods, and simplify foreign methods, and finally overcame the difficulties and basically solved the technical and equipment problems of large-scale steel production. Obviously, since we overcame such difficulties last year and overfulfilled the task, the conditions this year are much better than last year, the material foundation is more solid, the production equipment capacity has been greatly increased, the technical team has been expanded, the technical level has been improved, the practical experience is more abundant, and there is more close cooperation with fraternal provinces and cities. What difficulties can stop our greater leap forward?
    Of course, in order to overcome various difficulties and successfully complete this year's industrial production and construction tasks, the most basic thing is to continue to implement the general line for socialist construction, continue to implement the policy of "walking on two legs," carry out mass movements on a large scale, continue to exert greater effort, and combine soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, and combine hard work, practical work, and skillful work. In order to give full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and accelerate various construction projects, since this spring, we have been widely carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy throughout the province, and have set off a red flag competition upsurge with "ten comparisons" (namely, comparing ideas, comparing enthusiasm, comparing research, comparing products, comparing quality, comparing varieties, comparing efficiency, comparing costs, comparing safety, and comparing cooperation) as the content. A vigorous new upsurge in production is rising day by day. The broad masses of workers are working selflessly, carrying out technological revolution on a large scale, and doing everything possible to overcome various difficulties, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's various production targets.
    After several years of development, especially the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the backward economic face of Anhui has undergone great changes, laying the foundation for greater leap forward in the future. Anhui's resources are rich, the natural conditions are very good, and there are many favorable conditions for developing industrial and agricultural production. Under the wise leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the general line for socialist construction, and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year and the communization of the people throughout the province, we have full determination and confidence to complete the tasks given by the state and build Anhui into a modern industrial base and a modern agricultural base of the motherland as quickly as possible.

### 安徽工业一日千里  黄岩代表的发言

    安徽工业一日千里
    黄岩代表的发言主席，各位代表，
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告，同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的各项报告。拥护国务院平息西藏叛乱的命令，坚决反对英帝国主义与印度扩张主义分子狼狈为奸，干涉中国内政。他们的阴谋诡计，在我国各族人民坚强的团结下，已经失败了，他们如果胆敢继续干涉我国内政，必将碰得头破血流，遭受更大的失败。
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕的时候，毛主席曾这样教导我们：“我国人民应当努力工作，努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，准备在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家”。毛主席的这个指示，深刻地教育了我们，给了全国人民以莫大的鼓舞和力量。现在，虽然才是第二个五年计划的第二年，但是正如总理报告中所说的，我们的国家已经经历了一系列的具有重大历史意义的变化，在社会主义革命方面和社会主义建设方面，都获得了极其辉煌的成就。
    几年来，我们安徽人民遵循着毛主席的指示，为尽可能迅速地改变安徽的落后面貌，作了不懈的努力，取得的成就也是很大的。尽管在第一届全国人民代表大会期间，安徽又遭受两年大水、一年大旱和严重的病虫害的袭击，但在中央的正确领导和大力支持之下，经过全省人民的艰苦奋斗，各项生产建设事业仍然得到了较为迅速的发展，特别是一九五八年大跃进的成就，更大大超过了以往几年。一九五八年，我们战胜了罕见的大旱和严重的病虫害，获得了空前的大丰收。全省粮食产量达到四百二十亿斤，比风调雨顺的一九五七年增长了百分之七十以上；棉花产量达到二百八十三万担，比一九五七年增长近两倍；如和解放前一九四八年的产量相比，则粮食增长三点八倍，棉花增长十点七倍。农业的大跃进有力地推动了工业的大跃进。去年的工业总产值达到四十亿元，比一九五七年增长一点六倍，比一九四八年增长十三倍多，一年增长的绝对数字，相当于以前九年增长总和的一点一倍。工业产值占工农业总产值的比重，已经达到百分之三十三。全年用于工业的基本建设投资比第一个五年计划期间的投资总和还多半倍以上。
    总之，经过几年来的努力，特别是一九五八年的大跃进，我省不仅在农业方面已经打下了一个较好的基础，在工业方面也大大改变了原来极为落后的面貌。在这里，我想着重汇报一下安徽工业发展的情况。
    安徽现代工业从无到有，产量质量不断提高，产品种类不断增加
    安徽在解放前，除了两三家设备陈旧、管理落后的官僚资本主义企业外，简直没有现代工业。为数很少的私营工厂，都是破破烂烂，主要靠手工操作，生产效率很低。据一九四九年统计：全省工业的年产值仅二亿多元，几种主要工业产品的年产量：原煤只有一百一十四万吨，发电量只有二千四百万度，棉纱只有一千九百件，食用油仅有三万二千吨。经过几年来的建设，特别是一九五八年的大跃进，安徽工业的面貌起了巨大变化，到一九五八年底，全省共有国营厂矿达八千六百多个，职工共达一百零九万多人。去年下半年，全省农村实现了人民公社化，全民办工业的运动更形成了波澜壮阔的局面，人民公社不仅抽出了大量劳动力支援国家工业建设，还直接举办了各种小型厂、矿二十五万多个。全民办钢铁运动取得的成就更为突出，从去年九月起，在短短五个月内，就建成了八立方公尺以上的小洋高炉一千一百多座，小型炼钢转炉六百三十多座。去年全省生产了十三万吨钢、一百零七万吨铁，产品质量也一直保持着较好的水平。在“以钢为纲”的方针下，其他各项工业也都有很大的发展，形成了“全面跃进”的局面。这一年的机械产量达三万三千吨，原煤产量达八百六十六万吨，发电量达四亿一千九百万度，棉纱产量达九万八千八百件，食用油产量达十三万吨。几种主要工业产品产量，与一九五七年相比，钢增加五十六倍，铁增加四倍，机械增加三点四倍，原煤增加零点七倍，发电量增加一点一倍，棉纱增加一点一倍，食用油增加一点五倍。如与一九四九年相比，原煤增加六倍半，发电量增加十六倍，棉纱增加五十倍，食油增加三倍多。钢、铁、机床等产品在一九四九年还根本不能生产。
    工业的发展不仅表现在产量上，也表现在产品种类和质量上。几年来，安徽工业产量同品种一年比一年增加，一九五八年大跃进中，试制成功的新产品很多。现在我省不仅能生产相当数量的轻工业产品，供应人民生活的需要，而且还能生产机床、矿山机械、冶金设备、发电设备、农业机械等，为工农业生产和基本建设提供了装备，去年我省建设那样多小洋高炉所用的设备，绝大部分是由本省机械工业生产出来的。
    一九五八年我们在工业战线上所取得的巨大成就，也正如其他战线一样，归根结底是在全民整风运动伟大胜利的基础上，认真地执行了党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针的结果。
    一九五九年，在国家的统一计划下，我省除了在农业方面要力争完成六百亿斤粮食，四百二十万担棉花和其他各项指标外，在工业方面的主要生产指标是：生铁一百八十万吨，钢二十三万吨，煤一千六百万吨，发电量七亿一千万度，棉纱十七万件，食油二十一万多吨。这个指标和去年的实绩相比，铁增长百分之六十八点一，钢增长百分之七十六点九，煤增长百分之八十四点七，电增长百分之六十九点四，棉纱增长百分之七十二，食油增长百分之六十一点五。从表面看来，今年有些工业生产增长的百分比是比去年小了些，但是增加的绝对数却比去年更大了，因为工业的基础比过去扩大了，在这个新的基础上，今年每增加百分之一，其所包含的绝对数都比去年大得多。以生铁为例，去年每增加百分之一，等于增加二千零九十吨，而今年每增加百分之一，就增加一万零七百吨。所以我们说：今年的工业生产指标仍然是大跃进的指标。为了加速社会主义建设，力争在苦战几年以后基本上改变安徽面貌，这样一个跃进指标是完全必要的，从主观和客观条件来看，完成这个指标也是完全可能的。今年我们有比去年多得多的有利条件，比如：广大群众受到总路线的深刻教育和受到去年大跃进的鼓舞，干劲更高了；经过去年的大跃进，我省发展工业生产的物质和技术条件初步改善了；工业生产和建设的经验也比较多些了；特别是全省的人民公社在经过整顿之后，已得到进一步巩固和发展，它不仅是发展农业的主要依靠，也是发展工业的重要保证。只要充分地发挥这些有利条件，加强主观的努力，今年生产指标是有把握完成和超额完成的。今年第一季度执行计划的情况是良好的，与去年同期比较，工业总产值增长一点五倍，基本建设工作量增长零点七倍，产量质量都有显著提高，产品种类也不断增多，工业的劳动生产率比去年第四季度还提高了百分之五点四。当然，也有些单位第一季度的生产指标完成得不够全面、不够均衡，甚至未完成计划，但从总的方面看，是全面跃进的。从第一季度看全年，我们有充分根据对完成今年计划得出乐观的结论。
    克服原材料和技术力量不足等困难，乘胜前进
    但这并不是说完成今年的计划不需要克服任何困难了，困难还是有的，原材料不足、交通运输紧张和技术力量不足的困难，仍然是目前最突出的问题。这些困难都是前进中的暂时的困难，同去年大办钢铁中所遇到的困难情况比起来毕竟要好些。去年下半年我们是在工业基础薄弱的情况下，又是在很短的时间内，完成那样繁重的钢铁工业基本建设和生产任务的，当时的困难要比今年更多更大。但是，困难并没有吓倒我们，而是一个一个地被我们战胜了。例如：原材料不足，我们就集中使用，节约使用，首先保证重点项目和主要方面的需要，一般项目和次要的东西则利用代用品，并大量增产各种可能生产的原材料、如耐火材料、矿石、煤炭、焦炭、木材等等，这样，就基本上解决了一万二千七百多立方公尺的高炉建设和其他生产建设的需要。交通运输紧张，我们除了在工业基地的布局上注意就原料，就交通，尽量缩短运输距离外，并加强运输工作的计划性，加速车、船的周转率，大力开展交通改革技术运动，发动群众改革和制造各种运输工具，大力修建道路和疏浚航道，从而大大提高了运输能力和运输效率，在去年第四季度全省仅公路、航运完成的货运量即达七百八十四万吨，占全年货运量将近一半。今春我们对交通运输进行了整顿，运输更加趋于合理。技术力量不足，我们就采取现场培训、短期训练、以师带徒、以老带新、快速培训等方法，在短期内培训了十多万技术工人，扩大了技术队伍；并采取领导带头，发动群众，干部、工人、技术人员三结合的办法，大办“试验田”，大搞技术革新，洋土结合，土法洋化，洋法简化，终于克服了困难，基本解决了大办钢铁的技术问题和设备问题。很明显，我们既然战胜了去年那样的困难，而且超额完成了任务，今年的条件要比去年好得多，物质基础更加雄厚了，生产设备能力大大增加了，技术队伍扩大了，技术水平提高了，实际经验更加丰富了，又有各兄弟省、市更加密切的协作，还有什么困难能挡住我们更大的跃进呢？
    当然，要克服各种困难，胜利完成今年的工业生产和建设任务，最基本的一条，还是要继续贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，继续贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，大搞群众运动，继续鼓足更大的干劲，把冲天干劲和科学分析结合起来，把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来。为了充分发挥群众的革命干劲，加速各项建设，自今春以来，我们在全省范围内广泛开展着增产节约运动，掀起了以“十比”（即比思想、比干劲、比钻研、比产品、比质量、比品种、比效率、比成本、比安全、比协作）为内容的红旗竞赛热潮，一个轰轰烈烈的生产新高潮正在日益高涨。广大职工正在忘我地劳动，大搞技术革命，千方百计地克服各种困难，力争完成和超额完成今年的各项生产指标。
    经过几年的发展，特别是一九五八年的大跃进，安徽经济落后的面貌已经有了很大的改变，为今后更大的跃进打下了基础。安徽的资源是丰富的，自然条件是很好的，对发展工农业生产有着很多的有利条件。在中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的指导下，在去年大跃进和全省人民公社化的基础上，我们有充分的决心和信心来完成国家所给予的任务，尽可能快地把安徽建设成为祖国的一个现代工业基地和现代农业基地。
