Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 12th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on the 11th, the Vietnam Buddhist Association issued a statement condemning the Tibetan upper-class reactionary rebel group and supporting the Chinese Communist Party and the government's policy of quelling the rebellion.

The statement said that the Tibetan rebellion was launched by landlords, bad elements in religious clothing, and Tibetan upper-class reactionaries with the assistance of foreign imperialism. The statement said that they attempted to split the motherland, undermine national unity, and oppose the establishment of a happy life for the Tibetan people, thereby hoping to continue to maintain the system of oppression and exploitation of the Tibetan people.

The statement welcomed the Chinese government's action to quell the Tibetan rebels and considered it "legitimate and necessary" because it was in the interests of the Tibetan people and all the Chinese people. The statement said that, in fact, Buddhist monks and believers, as well as all Chinese working people, wholeheartedly support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebels, thereby helping to quickly restore normalcy in Lhasa. The statement warmly welcomed Panchen Erdeni's arrival in Lhasa to serve as Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. The statement pointed out, "This is a positive action, which fully conforms to the wishes and interests of the Tibetan people."

The statement continued, "We heartily welcome the great policy of equality among all nationalities of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, the great policy of Chairman Mao Zedong leading the timely suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, and especially their firm policy of freedom of religious belief."

The statement concluded by saying that the victory of the Chinese people in Tibet is the shameful failure of the American-Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The Presidium of the Burmese National United Front believes that the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is purely China's internal affair and opposes using this event to attack China.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, April 12th: A resolution passed at a meeting of the Presidium of the Burmese National United Front on the 11th stated that the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet is entirely China's internal affair.

The resolution condemned certain elements in Myanmar for using the Tibetan rebellion to attack the People's Republic of China. The resolution said that some people in Myanmar are also trying to use the events in Tibet as a tool to influence Myanmar's neutral foreign policy.

An article in the Indian "Blitz" weekly pointed out that Tibet is a part of China, which is a historical fact, and that the collusion between the rebels and the Taiwan group clearly constitutes treason.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 12th: A recent article in the "Blitz" weekly regarding the Tibetan rebellion stated, "Tibet is a part of China, and although many people may not like this acknowledgment, it is a historical fact."

The article said, "To talk about Tibetan independence at this moment is detrimental to the cause of the Tibetan people; moreover, it is tantamount to alienating India and China."

The article, entitled "Is There a National Rebellion in Tibet?" pointed out that "the rebels in Lhasa used modern weapons" and that "the leader of the Taiwan group, notorious in the world, has now finally admitted that he has formed an alliance with the rebels and that he has supplied them with weapons. It is not difficult to judge the nature and characteristics of the so-called national uprising in Tibet."

The article listed two basic facts about Tibet, explaining that the Chinese central government's policy in its relations with Tibet is correct. One is that Tibetan reactionaries wanted to have private armies of large feudal lords; the other is that they opposed any reform, including land reform.

The article asked, "Let us carefully consider here: which central government can tolerate private armies on its territory?" The article said, "The 1951 agreement also included land reform. The social system of Tibet must be reformed. Although large-scale land reform has been carried out throughout China, it has not touched Tibet. It should be said that this is thanks to Beijing."

The article exposed the Tibetan traitors' fabrication of the slogan "religion is in danger" to oppose the reform movement, saying, "It is a foolish political judgment to think that if their religious leaders oppose social progress, the backward masses will also rise up to oppose it."

　　中国平息西藏叛乱　帝国主义阴谋失败
    越南佛教协会发表声明支持我政府平定叛乱的政策谴责西藏上层反动叛乱集团
    新华社河内12日电　据越南通讯社11日报道，越南佛教协会发表声明，谴责西藏上层反动叛乱集团，并且支持中国共产党和政府平定叛乱的政策。
    声明说，西藏的叛乱是地主、披着宗教外衣的坏分子和西藏上层反动分子在外国帝国主义的协助下发动起来的。声明说，他们企图分裂祖国、破坏民族团结、反对为西藏人民建立幸福的生活，从而希望继续保持压迫和剥削西藏人民的制度。
    声明欢迎中国政府平定西藏叛乱分子的行动，并且认为这是“合法的和必要的”，因为这是符合西藏人民和全体中国人民的利益的。声明说，实际上，佛教僧侣和信仰佛教的人以及全体中国劳动人民竭诚地支持人民解放军平定叛乱分子，从而有助于迅速恢复拉萨的正常局面。声明热烈欢迎班禅额尔德尼到达拉萨以担任西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员的职务。声明指出，“这是一个积极的行动，它完全符合西藏人民的愿望和利益。”
    声明继续说，“我们衷心地欢迎中国共产党中央委员会和政府的各民族一律平等的伟大政策，欢迎毛泽东主席领导及时平定西藏叛乱的伟大政策，特别是他们的信仰自由的坚定的政策。”
    声明最后说，中国人民在西藏的胜利就是美国—蒋介石集团的可耻失败。
    缅甸民族团结阵线主席团认为平定西藏叛乱纯属中国内政反对利用这一事件攻击中国
    新华社仰光12日电　缅甸民族团结阵线主席团在11日举行的会议上通过的一项决议说，中国政府平定西藏的叛乱完全是中国的内政。
    决议谴责缅甸的某些方面利用西藏叛乱事件来攻击中华人民共和国。决议说，缅甸的某些人还设法把在西藏发生的事件作为影响缅甸的中立外交政策的工具。
    印度“闪电”周报的文章指出西藏为中国的一部分原是历史事实叛匪和台湾集团勾结显系叛国性质
    新华社新德里12日电　最近一期的“闪电”周报刊载的一篇关于西藏叛乱事件的文章说，“西藏是中国的一部分，尽管许多人可能不喜欢这种承认，这是历史事实。”
    文章说，“在这个时刻空谈西藏独立是有害西藏人的事业的；而且，这等于是在离间印度和中国”。
    这篇题为“在西藏有民族叛乱吗？”的文章指出，“叛乱分子在拉萨使用现代化的武器”，并且“在世界上声名狼籍的台湾集团的领袖现在终于供认，他同叛乱分子结成了联盟，他曾经供应他们武器。要对西藏的所谓民族起义的性质和特征作出判断，是不难的”。
    文章列举了西藏的两个基本事实，说明中国的中央政府在同西藏关系方面的政策是正确的。一个是西藏反动分子要有大封建主的私人军队；另一个是他们反对任何改革，包括土地改革。
    文章问道，“让我们在这里仔细考虑一下：有哪一个中央政府能够容忍在它的领土上有私人军队呢？”文章说，“1951年的协议也包括土地改革。西藏的社会制度必须加以改革。虽然整个中国都进行了大规模的土地改革，但是没有触及西藏。应该说，这要归功于北京”。
    文章揭露了西藏叛国分子捏造“宗教在危险中”的口号来反对改革运动，文章说，“如果以为他们宗教领袖反对社会进步，落后群众也一定会起来反对，这是一种愚昧的政治判断。”
