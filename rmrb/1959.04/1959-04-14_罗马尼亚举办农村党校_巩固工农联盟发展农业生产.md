Bucharest, April 13th (By our correspondent) – Romania’s rural party school studies, which began last winter and spring, have concluded. A total of 237,000 party members, alternate party members, and non-party activists participated in the studies.

Since the Romanian Workers' Party's Sixth Plenary Session last June, party organizations at all levels have placed greater emphasis on the education of party members, and the number of people participating in party school studies in both urban and rural areas has greatly increased. In 1958, there were more than 5,000 people teaching party classes in rural party schools.

The main content of the 1958 rural party school studies included the history of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Party Constitution, the documents of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and important resolutions of the Romanian Workers' Party in the past two years. The rural party school studies paid special attention to issues closely related to rural socialist construction. For example, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, consolidating and developing socialist agriculture, and rapidly increasing agricultural products occupied an important position in the studies. Through this study, rural party members have greatly improved their political level and have a clearer understanding of the party's tasks in rural areas.

　　罗马尼亚举办农村党校
　　巩固工农联盟发展农业生产
    本报布加勒斯特13日电　罗马尼亚去冬今春进行的农村党校学习已经结束。参加学习的党员、候补党员和非党积极分子共二十三万七千人。
    罗马尼亚自从去年党的六月全会后，各级党组织都更加重视对党员的教育工作，在城市和农村中参加党校学习的人数也有了很大增加。1958年度，在农村党校讲授党课的人员有五千多名。
    1958年度农村党校学习的主要内容是罗马尼亚工人党党史、党章，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会文件和罗马尼亚工人党最近两年的重要决议等。农村党校的学习特别注意了同农村社会主义建设密切联系的问题。例如巩固工农联盟，巩固和发展社会主义农业和迅速增加农产品等问题在学习中占有重要地位。农村党员通过这次学习，大大提高自己的政治水平，对党在农村中的任务也更加明确了。
