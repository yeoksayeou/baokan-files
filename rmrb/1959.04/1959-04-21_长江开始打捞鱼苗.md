    Yangtze River Begins Salvaging Fish Fry
    Groups of parent fish in the Yangtze River are swimming upstream towards Yidu and the Three Gorges area. Relevant departments predict that a large number of fish fry are about to be produced. Hubei Province, a nationally renowned freshwater fish production area, has recently begun salvaging fish fry. Currently, the county Party secretaries or county heads of all counties along the Yangtze River in Hubei Province have formed fish fry and fish species production headquarters. More than 30,000 skilled fish fry salvagers on both sides of the Yangtze River, equipped with more than 140,000 “geng nets” (a tool for salvaging fish fry), have set up thousands of “geng sheds” along the riverbank from Yichang to Jiujiang, a distance of more than 1,000 li, waiting for the arrival of large numbers of fish fry. Fish fry purchasing personnel from twenty-two provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have successively arrived in Wuhan, preparing to purchase and transport fish fry back to develop local freshwater fish farming.

    长江开始打捞鱼苗
    长江成群的亲鱼正逆水游往宜都、三峡一带。据有关部门预计，大批鱼苗即将生产。全国著名的淡水鱼产地的湖北省，最近已经开始打捞鱼苗。目前，湖北省沿江各县都以县委书记或县长为首成立了鱼苗、鱼种生产指挥部。长江两岸的三万多名打捞鱼苗的能手，已带着十四万多个绠网（一种捞鱼苗的工具），在从宜昌到九江一千多里的江岸线上，搭起成千的绠棚，等待大批鱼苗到来。来自二十二个省、市、自治区的鱼苗采购人员，陆续到达武汉，准备购运鱼苗回去，发展当地淡水养鱼。
