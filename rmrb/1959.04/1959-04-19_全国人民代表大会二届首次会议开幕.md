Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The first session of the Second National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China solemnly opened at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai at 3:00 p.m. today. Chairman Mao Zedong presided over the opening ceremony. Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the "Government Work Report" on behalf of the State Council.

Members of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, responsible persons of various government departments, and senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who were also meeting in Beijing, attended the meeting as observers.

At 3:00 p.m., Chairman Mao Zedong announced the opening of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. The entire audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically. The band played the national anthem.

Premier Zhou Enlai then delivered the "Government Work Report" to the Congress.

Premier Zhou's Government Work Report was divided into five parts: the great achievements during the period of the First Five-Year Plan and the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan – 1958, our tasks on the economic front in the second year of the Second Five-Year Plan – 1959, our tasks on the cultural and educational front, on the political life of the country, and on foreign policy.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that during the four-year term of the First National People's Congress, our country has undergone a series of changes of great historical significance. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the struggle between the two roads, socialism has basically triumphed over capitalism in all aspects. Due to the completion and overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, our country has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization, and on this basis, in 1958, there was an unprecedented great leap forward in the national economy in our country's history. In industry and agriculture, in transportation and postal services, in commerce, and in cultural and educational undertakings, there have been tremendous leaps forward. In the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese people have made a great creation in terms of social organization, which is the people's commune established in rural areas throughout the country according to the demands of the broad masses of peasants.

When analyzing the reasons for the Great Leap Forward, Premier Zhou emphasized that the most important reason for the Great Leap Forward in 1958 was that we summarized the experience of the First Five-Year Plan in the spring of 1958, began to find a better way for our country to build socialism, and formulated the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The general line formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong is a line that fully estimates the enthusiasm of the more than 600 million people in building socialism after the victory of the socialist revolution, and fully mobilizes all positive factors.

He pointed out that in our country's socialist construction cause, the countries of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union have given us assistance in many aspects. The 166 major construction projects that the Soviet Union helped us build during our country's First Five-Year Plan have played a significant role in the development of our country's economic construction. The rich experience of the Soviet Union since its founding is also an important basis for us to formulate and implement economic construction plans.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that in 1959, we should continue to leap forward on the basis of the great victory in 1958, along the road opened up in 1958, and strive to achieve greater victories on all fronts.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the 1959 national economic plan submitted to this People's Congress for review and approval is a plan for continued great leap forward. The total output value of industry and agriculture in 1959 will increase by 40% compared with 1958, reaching 287 billion yuan. This plan, formulated according to the Party's general line for socialist construction, takes into account both the objective possibility of our country's material and technical conditions, and the subjective initiative of the revolutionary spirit of the people; it takes into account both the requirements that industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, production and transportation must adapt to each other in development, and it adheres to the principle that construction must have a focus, must prioritize the development of heavy industry, especially the development of raw materials and materials industries, and take steel as the key link. He said that the realization of the magnificent national economic plan for 1959 will continue to expand the material basis of our country's socialism, will prepare more conditions for the continuous leap forward of our country's industry and the mechanization of agriculture, will complete and overfulfill the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program regarding increased grain and cotton production ahead of schedule, and will guarantee the continued improvement of the people's material living standards.

Premier Zhou pointed out that in order to realize the 1959 plan with its high speed and large scale, the people of the whole country must continue to fight heroically, work hard, work practically, and work cleverly, and strive to overcome difficulties. The most important issue that should be paid attention to at present is to strengthen centralized leadership, make overall arrangements, seize various organizational work and specific measures, and vigorously carry out mass movements on various economic fronts. Whether on the industrial, agricultural, transportation, or commercial front, the central link of the mass movement should be to increase labor productivity, increase production, practice strict economy, and oppose waste. We should immediately launch a national movement to increase production and practice economy in every corner of the country.

On the cultural and educational front, Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that our task is to continue to mobilize all positive factors, advance the cause of cultural revolution, popularize socialist culture, and continuously carry out consolidation and improvement work on the basis of popularization, so that the development of cultural and educational work can meet the needs of the entire socialist construction.

He said that we have carried out a huge and profound revolution in education by adhering to the working class's worldview and the educational principles of socialism and communism, and implementing the policy of education serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor. He called for better implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor.

Premier Zhou said that for the sound development of science and art, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" should be implemented on the basis of serving socialism. This policy points out the road to the prosperity and development of our country's science and culture, and has given great encouragement to the entire scientific and cultural circles. We believe that after free debates between different schools of thought and different opinions in science, and free competition between different forms and styles in art, it will not be long before our scientific and cultural undertakings will surely enter an era of prosperity and achieve great achievements.

Premier Zhou pointed out that the self-transformation work of the old intellectuals has made many achievements, and young intellectuals are also growing up in large numbers. He called on all patriotic intellectuals to unite under the banner of socialism and work together to build a great motherland.

Premier Zhou Enlai then said that our country's people's democratic dictatorship and the unity of the people have become more consolidated than ever before after the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on all fronts. Due to the victory of the socialist revolution, especially the in-depth development of the rectification movement, and the gradual implementation of the policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people put forward by Chairman Mao Zedong, people's democracy has been greatly developed. He said that the foundation of the great unity of the people of our country is the alliance of workers and peasants. Under the premise of continuing to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, we will continue to maintain the alliance of the working people with the non-working people who can cooperate during the period of socialist construction. In the future, it will be necessary to continue to consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front in our country on the basis of serving socialism.

Premier Zhou said that in the past four years, the implementation of national regional autonomy under the principle of ensuring national unity and realizing national equality has achieved great results. In addition to the original Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region , the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and the Ningxia HuiAutonomous Region have been established successively, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has also been established. In addition, 29 autonomous prefectures and 54 autonomous counties have been established in Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces and autonomous regions. These ethnic autonomous areas include more than 30 ethnic groups. In the minority areas, except for Tibet and a few other places, democratic reform has been completed and socialist transformation has been basically completed, and on this basis, people's communes have been realized. Many minority nationalities have embarked on the bright road of socialism and are developing rapidly. Due to the correct implementation of national policies, the friendly unity between the Han nationality and all fraternal nationalities, as well as among all fraternal nationalities, has been greatly strengthened.

Premier Zhou mentioned the Tibet issue in his report. He said that the armed rebellion launched by the original local government of Tibet and the reactionary clique of the upper class has suffered a shameful defeat. The government ordered the dissolution of the original local government of Tibet, and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region exercised the functions and powers of the local government, so that Tibet could quickly realize national local autonomy and gradually carry out democratic reforms. This measure was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of patriotic monks and lay people in Tibet. This is a great victory for our country's national unity policy. He said that now, the situation in Tibet is completely under the control of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region has begun to exercise the functions and powers of the local government. Although the Dalai Lama has been kidnapped to India, we still hope that he can get rid of the coercion of the insurgents and return to the motherland.

Premier Zhou said that Tibet is Chinese territory. The rebellion of the Tibetan reactionaries and the suppression of this rebellion are China's internal affairs. Premier Zhou welcomed the statements made successively by Indian Prime Minister Nehru that he would not interfere in China's internal affairs and would continue to consolidate Sino-Indian friendly relations. He said that China and India have a history of friendly relations of more than 2,000 years and are both initiators of peaceful coexistence. There is no reason for our two countries to shake their friendship and the diplomatic principles that both countries abide by because of a small group of insurgents in Tibet. We hope that with the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet, through the joint efforts of China and India, the friendly relations between the two great peaceful countries in Asia, which together have a population of more than one billion, will be given a more solid foundation and better development.

In the last part of the report, Premier Zhou Enlai analyzed the international situation and elaborated on our country's foreign policy.

He said that the overall characteristics of the current international situation are that the strength of socialism, the strength of the national independence movement, and other peace-loving forces are developing rapidly, while the imperialist policy of aggression and war is falling into heavy difficulties. As Chairman Mao Zedong said, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day.

He said that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is now in the high tide of economic construction. It is completely certain that in a not very long historical period, the Soviet Union will surpass the United States in terms of per capita production level, China will also become an advanced major industrial country, and the entire socialist camp will significantly surpass the imperialist camp in terms of material production, thereby fully guaranteeing world peace.

Premier Zhou emphasized that consolidating unity with the Soviet Union and consolidating unity with all socialist countries are our country's fundamental policies. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, he expressed deep gratitude to the Soviet Union and the governments and peoples of other socialist countries for their assistance in our country's socialist construction. He said that the iron fortress of friendship and unity between China and the Soviet Union and all socialist countries cannot be broken by anyone and will never be broken.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people have always sympathized with all struggles in the world against imperialism, colonialism, aggression, and interference. We are willing to provide support and assistance within our capabilities to all national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He said that in the common struggle against the imperialist policy of aggression and war, and in the common effort to uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, our country has extensively established friendship with a series of newly independent countries in Asia and Africa. We cherish this friendship very much and are very grateful for their support for our country in international affairs. We and many countries in Southeast Asia can and have formed an area of peace in Asia. We hope that this area of peace will last permanently and continue to expand to the entire Asia. He said that in the anti-imperialist struggles of the Arab nations in recent years, we have always stood by the people of the Arab countries. Recently, some complex situations have emerged in the Arab national independence movement. Some people in power in the United Arab Republic attack Iraq and the Soviet Union, which is detrimental to the cause of Arab national independence and cannot win the sympathy of the people of Arab countries. We hope that this difficulty encountered by the cause of Arab national independence can find a way to overcome it, so that the imperialists' vicious conspiracy to harm the Arab nations cannot succeed.

Premier Zhou pointed out that imperialist countries are being hit by economic crises. Their conflicts with each other are becoming apparent, and the general trend of their going towards disintegration is inevitable.

He said that socialist countries have always advocated peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with capitalist countries, but imperialist warmongering groups have always attempted to use new wars to reverse the wheels of historical development. U.S. imperialism is particularly committed to reviving German and Japanese militarism, which cannot but arouse the serious attention of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world. Our government supports the Soviet government's proposal to end the occupation system in West Berlin and make West Berlin a free city, as well as the proposal to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany. Due to the consistent efforts of the Soviet government and the strong demands of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, the United States, Britain, and France have had to agree to the Soviet proposal to convene a meeting of foreign ministers and a summit meeting. We hope that these meetings will help solve mature international issues, first of all the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin issue, thereby opening the way to easing international tensions.

Premier Zhou said that the Chinese people cannot sit idly by and watch the revival of Japanese militarism, nor can they tolerate the Kishi Nobusuke government continuing to adopt a policy of hostility towards China. The Chinese people welcome the great efforts made by the Japanese people to develop friendly relations between the two peoples. We believe that the series of proposals put forward by the delegations of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese Socialist Party during their visits to China one after another regarding improving Sino-Japanese relations and restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations are completely correct. We believe that the Japanese people will eventually break through all obstacles and develop peaceful and friendly relations with the Chinese people.

He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is stepping up its aggression and war preparations in East Asia, seriously threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the People's Republic of China, as well as peace in East Asia. As a party concerned to the Geneva Accords and the Korean Armistice Agreement, we absolutely cannot allow the United States to undermine these agreements and realize its conspiracy to expand its aggression.

Premier Zhou said that we are willing to establish and develop friendly and good-neighborly relations with all neighboring countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We advocate the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone and a zone of peace in the entire East Asia and Pacific region. China does not want to threaten anyone, does not want to harm anyone, and does not ask anyone to change the social and political system they have chosen. However, we must also remind those who follow U.S. imperialism, are hostile to our country, and threaten our country that if they persist in this approach, they must bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

Premier Zhou reiterated that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and we must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. All U.S. armed forces in the Taiwan area must withdraw. Any conspiracy to split Chinese territory and create "two Chinas" is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out as he was about to conclude his report that our cause is thriving in all aspects and is advancing rapidly, because our cause is a just cause and a cause supported by the broad masses of the people.

In the last part of the report, he said, all our achievements were created by the united strength of all patriotic people in our country. In the past, we united all who could be united; in the future, we will continue to do so. Let us unite closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction, and use the positive actions of completing and overfulfilling the 1959 plan to greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland—the People's Republic of China!

Premier Zhou Enlai's report was more than 30,000 words long and lasted for two hours and thirty-five minutes. His report was frequently interrupted by stormy applause from the audience.

Today's meeting ended at 6:00 p.m.

Foreign envoys and diplomatic officials stationed in China, as well as some foreign guests, were invited to attend today's meeting as guests of the meeting.

Tomorrow, NPC deputies and CPPCC members will discuss Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" in groups.

    三时，毛泽东主席宣布中华人民共和国第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕。全场起立，热烈鼓掌。乐队高奏国歌。
    周恩来总理接着向大会作了“政府工作报告”。
    周总理的政府工作报告共分五个部分：第一个五年计划时期内和第二个五年计划的第一年——1958年的伟大成就，我们在第二个五年计划的第二年——1959年经济战线上的任务，我们在文化教育战线上的任务，关于国家的政治生活，关于对外政策。
    周恩来总理说，在第一届全国人民代表大会的四年多的任期中间，我国经历了一系列具有重大历史意义的变化。我国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，已经在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面获得了辉煌的成就。在两条道路的斗争中，社会主义在各个方面基本上战胜了资本主义。由于第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成，我国已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础，并且在这个基础上，1958年出现了我国历史上前所未有的国民经济大跃进。在工业和农业方面，在运输邮电方面，在商业方面，在文化教育事业方面，都有了巨大的跃进。在大跃进中，我国人民在社会组织方面有了一个伟大的创造，这就是全国农村中根据广大农民的要求而建立的人民公社。
    周总理分析大跃进的原因时着重指出，1958年大跃进的最重要的原因，是在于我们在1958年春季总结了第一个五年计划的经验，开始找到了我国建设社会主义的更好的方法，制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。中共中央和毛泽东主席所制定的这条总路线，是一条充分估计到在社会主义革命胜利以后的六亿多人民建设社会主义的积极性，把一切积极因素充分动员起来的路线。
    他指出，在我国的社会主义建设事业中，以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国给了我们多方面的援助。苏联在我国第一个五年计划期间帮助我们建设的一百六十六个重大建设项目，对于我国经济建设的发展，起了显著的作用。苏联建国以来的丰富经验，也是我们制订和实现经济建设计划的一项重要的依据。
    周恩来总理说，1959年，我们应当在1958年的巨大胜利的基础上，沿着1958年所开辟的道路，继续跃进，争取在各个战线上获得更大的胜利。
    周恩来总理说，提请这次人民代表大会审定的1959年国民经济计划，是一个继续大跃进的计划。1959年的工农业总产值将比1958年增长40％，达到二千八百七十亿元。这个根据党的社会主义建设总路线拟定的计划，既考虑了我国物质技术条件的客观可能性，也考虑了人民群众革命干劲的主观能动性；既考虑了工业和农业、重工业和轻工业、生产和运输在发展中必须互相适应的要求，也坚持了建设必须有重点、必须优先发展重工业、首先是发展原料、材料工业和以钢为纲的方针。他说，实现1959年的宏伟的国民经济计划，将继续扩大我国社会主义的物质基础，将为我国的工业的不断跃进和农业的机械化准备更多的条件，将提前超额完成全国农业发展纲要关于粮棉增产的要求，将保证人民的物质生活水平的继续提高。
    周总理指出，为了实现速度很高、规模宏大的1959年计划，全国人民必须继续英勇奋斗，苦干实干巧干，努力克服困难。当前应当注意的最重要的问题，是要加强集中领导，全面安排，抓紧各项组织工作和具体措施，大力开展各个经济战线上的群众运动。无论工业、农业、运输业或者商业战线上，群众运动的中心环节都应当是提高劳动生产率，增加生产，厉行节约，反对浪费。我们应当在全国的每一个角落，立即开展一个增产节约的全民运动。
    在文化教育战线方面，周恩来总理指出，我们的任务是要继续调动一切积极因素，向前推进文化革命的事业，普及社会主义的文化，并且不断地在普及的基础上进行巩固和提高的工作，使文教工作的发展能够适应整个社会主义建设的需要。
  他说，我们按照工人阶级的世界观和社会主义、共产主义的教育原则，贯彻执行了教育为工人阶级的政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，从而展开了教育事业的巨大的深刻的革命。他要求更好地贯彻执行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针。
    周总理说，为了科学和艺术的健全发展，应当在为社会主义服务的基础上贯彻执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。这个方针指出了我国科学文化繁荣发展的道路，给了整个科学界和文化界以巨大的鼓舞。我们相信，经过科学上不同学派、不同见解的自由争论，艺术上不同形式、不同风格的自由竞赛，不要很久，我们的科学文化事业一定能够进入一个昌盛的时代，并且获得伟大的成就。
    周总理指出，旧知识分子的自我改造工作取得了很多成绩，年青的知识分子也正在大量成长起来。他号召一切爱国的知识分子在社会主义的旗帜下团结起来，共同为建设伟大的祖国而努力。
    周恩来总理接着说，我国的人民民主专政，人民内部的团结，在各个战线上的社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利以后，比以前任何时期都更加巩固了。由于社会主义革命的胜利，特别是由于整风运动的深入，由于毛泽东主席所提出的正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针的逐步贯彻执行，人民民主得到了重大的发展。他说，我国人民大团结的基础是工人和农民的联盟。在继续加强工农联盟的前提下，在社会主义建设时期，我们将继续保持劳动人民同可以合作的非劳动人民的联盟。今后在我国仍然需要在为社会主义服务的基础上继续巩固和发展人民民主统一战线。
    周总理说，过去四年中，在保证国家统一、实现民族平等的原则下，推行民族区域自治，已经收到很大的成效。除了原有的内蒙古自治区以外，先后成立了新疆维吾尔自治区、广西僮族自治区、宁夏回族自治区，并且成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会。此外，还在青海、甘肃、新疆、云南、四川、贵州和其他若干省、自治区内成立了二十九个自治州，五十四个自治县。这些民族自治地方包括三十几个民族。在少数民族地区内，除了西藏和其他很少一些地方以外，都已经完成了民主改革和基本上完成了社会主义改造，并且在这个基础上实现了人民公社化。许多少数民族已经走上了社会主义的光明大道，正在一日千里地向前发展。由于民族政策的正确执行，汉族和各兄弟民族以及各兄弟民族之间的友好团结，已经大大加强了。
    周总理在报告中谈到了西藏问题。他说，西藏原地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的武装叛乱已经遭到可耻的失败。政府命令解散原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，使西藏迅速实现民族地方自治和逐步进行民主改革，这一措施受到西藏广大爱国僧俗人民的热烈欢迎。这是我国民族团结政策的一个伟大胜利。他说，现在，西藏的局势已经完全在人民解放军西藏军区和西藏自治区筹备委员会的控制之下。西藏自治区筹备委员会已经开始行使地方政府职权。达赖喇嘛虽然已经被劫往印度，我们仍然希望他能够摆脱叛乱分子的挟持，回到祖国来。
    周总理说，西藏是中国的领土。西藏反动分子的叛乱和这一叛乱的平定，是中国的内政。周总理对印度尼赫鲁总理连续发表不干涉中国内政和继续巩固中印友好关系的声明，表示欢迎。他说，中印两国有两千多年的友好历史，并且同是首倡和平共处的国家。我们两国都没有任何理由因为西藏的一小撮叛乱分子而动摇相互间的友谊和两国共同遵守的外交原则。我们希望，随着西藏叛乱的平定，通过中印双方的共同努力，亚洲两个共有人口超过十亿的伟大的和平国家的友好关系，将获得更加巩固的基础和更好的发展。
    周恩来总理在报告的最后部分分析了国际形势，阐述了我国的对外政策。
    他说，目前国际形势的总的特点，就是社会主义的力量、民族独立运动的力量和其他爱好和平的力量迅速发展，而帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，则陷入重重困难之中。正如毛泽东主席所说，敌人在一天天烂下去，我们在一天天好起来。
    他说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营现在都处在经济建设的高潮中。完全可以肯定，在一个不很长的历史时期内，苏联将在按人口平均计算的生产水平方面超过美国，中国也将变成一个先进的大工业国，整个社会主义阵营将在物质生产方面显著地超过帝国主义阵营，从而使得世界和平得到充分的保障。
    周总理着重指出，巩固同苏联的团结，巩固同一切社会主义国家的团结，是我国的根本方针。他代表我国政府和人民向苏联和其他社会主义国家的政府和人民对我国社会主义建设的援助表示深切的感谢。他说，中苏两国以及所有社会主义国家友好团结的钢铁堡垒是任何人冲不破的，是永远冲不破的。
    周恩来总理说，中国人民一向同情世界上一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义、反侵略、反干涉的斗争，我们对于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的一切民族独立运动，都愿意给予我们力所能及的支持和援助。他说，在反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的共同斗争中，在维护和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的共同努力中，我国同亚非一系列新独立的国家广泛地建立了友谊。我们很珍视这种友谊，并且很感谢他们在国际事务中对于我国的支持。我们同东南亚许多国家能够而且已经形成亚洲的和平地区。我们希望这种和平地区将持久地存在下去，并且一直扩大到整个亚洲。他说，在近几年阿拉伯民族的反帝斗争中，我们始终是站在阿拉伯各国人民一边的。最近，阿拉伯民族独立运动中出现了某种复杂的情况。阿联的一些当权人物攻击伊拉克和苏联，不利于阿拉伯民族独立事业，不可能获得阿拉伯各国人民的同情。我们希望阿拉伯民族独立事业所遇到的这个困难能够找到克服的方法，使帝国主义者陷害阿拉伯民族的恶毒阴谋不能得逞。
    周总理指出，帝国主义国家正在受着经济危机的冲击。他们相互间的冲突正在表面化，他们走向四分五裂的总的趋势是不可避免的。
    他说，社会主义国家始终主张同资本主义国家和平共处，和平竞赛，但是帝国主义好战集团却一直企图用新的战争来扭转历史发展的车轮。美帝国主义特别致力于复活德国的和日本的军国主义，这不能不引起全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的严重注意。我国政府支持苏联政府提出的结束西柏林的占领制度和使西柏林成为自由城市的建议，以及由有关国家召开和会讨论并签订对德和约的建议。由于苏联政府的一贯努力和全世界爱好和平国家和人民的强烈要求，美英法三国已经不得不同意苏联关于召开外长会议和政府首脑会议的建议。我们希望，这些会议将有助于解决成熟了的国际问题，首先是对德和约问题和柏林问题，从而为和缓国际紧张局势打开道路。
    周总理说，中国人民不能坐视日本军国主义的复活，也不能容忍岸信介政府继续采取敌视中国的政策。中国人民欢迎日本人民为了发展两国人民友好关系所作的巨大努力。我们认为，最近日本共产党和日本社会党的代表团在先后访华期间所提出的关于改善中日关系，恢复中日邦交的一系列主张，是完全正确的。我们相信，日本人民终将冲破一切障碍，发展同中国人民的和平友好关系。
    他指出，美帝国主义正在加紧它在东亚的侵略和备战活动，严重地威胁到越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国的安全和东亚的和平。作为日内瓦协议和朝鲜停战协定的有关方面，我们绝对不能容许美国破坏这些协议和实现它扩大侵略的阴谋。
    周总理说，我们愿意根据和平共处的五项原则，同所有邻邦建立和发展友好的睦邻关系。我们主张在整个东亚和太平洋区域建立无原子武器地区，建立和平地区。中国不想威胁任何人，不想损害任何人，不要求任何人改变他们所选择的社会政治制度。但是，我们也要提醒那些追随美帝国主义、敌视我国和威胁我国的人们，如果他们坚持这种做法，他们必须承担由此引起的一切后果。
  周总理重申，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，我们一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖。台湾地区的一切美国武装力量必须撤走。任何割裂中国领土、制造“两个中国”的阴谋，都是中国人民绝对不能容许的。
    周恩来总理在将要结束他的报告时指出，我们的事业，各方面都在欣欣向荣，都在快步前进，这是因为我们的事业是正义的事业，是受到广大人民支持的事业。
    他在报告的最后说，我们的一切成就是我国全体爱国人民团结一致的力量创造的。在过去，我们团结了一切能够团结的人；在今后，我们也将继续这样做。让我们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的指导下，紧密地团结起来，用完成和超额完成1959年计划的积极行动，来迎接我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年！
