Strive for Every Cotton Seed to Sprout
Shandong Holds On-Site Meeting in Linqing to Strengthen Planting Preparation
Shaanxi Formulates Eight Technical Measures to Improve Sowing Quality

Our newspaper dispatch from Jinan, April 1st: Shandong Province held a cotton field meeting in Linqing City to promote the experience of Linqing City in preparing for cotton planting, and further studied how to grow cotton well and ensure full emergence at once.

Linqing City, a major cotton-producing area, has done an exceptionally good job in preparing for cotton planting this year, building on the bumper harvest of 1958. This city plans to plant 500,000 mu of cotton this year, with a yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, including 250,000 mu of high-yield fields with a yield of 1,500 jin of seed cotton per mu. In order to achieve this grand leap forward target, they proposed as early as last winter to plan early, arrange early, seize time, and strive for initiative, requiring one sowing to achieve full, uniform, and vigorous seedlings. Therefore, the planting preparation work of this city has become a model for the entire province. From December of last year, all people's communes in the city carried out free airing of views and debates on the 1959 planned targets from top to bottom. Through debates, the plan took root among the masses. Subsequently, party committees at all levels led more than 100,000 laborers in large-scale deep plowing of cotton fields. After 50 days of arduous struggle, all 500,000 mu of cotton fields were plowed more than eight inches deep. Fertilizer was applied along with plowing. Currently, the general application of base fertilizer has reached 20,000 to 30,000 jin per mu, an increase of three to four times compared to last year. At present, special attention is being paid to the issue of moisture retention. The water conservancy conditions of all cotton fields are also well prepared. In addition to 5,0349 machine wells and water wells in the city, four large and small trunk canals and 2,380 canals at all levels have been built, providing abundant water sources, ensuring a bumper cotton harvest even without rain. At this time when sowing is about to begin, the communes are also launching a mass movement to cultivate cotton seedlings. At the same time, more than 1,000 iron and wood workers were organized to repair farm tools, and a large number of technicians were trained to be responsible for management in separate areas.

This city won the honorary title of "Insect-Free City" last year, which greatly contributed to increased cotton production. This year, they launched two insect eradication campaigns, eliminating a large number of overwintering pests. At present, all communes and teams have prepared sufficient pesticides, ready to eliminate pests and diseases outside the cotton fields. Representatives from various places visited the city's cotton sowing preparations and praised them repeatedly, greatly encouraged. After the meeting's visits and introductions and exchange of experiences, the attending representatives' confidence in a bumper cotton harvest was enhanced.

Our newspaper dispatch from Xi'an, April 1st: At the provincial cotton conference held in Shaanxi Province from March 21st to 23rd, eight major technical measures for sowing cotton this year were formulated based on past experience. The meeting decided to immediately conduct an inspection and acceptance work throughout the province and further promote Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting technology.

The eight major technical measures formulated at the meeting are: 1. Plant all cotton on deeply plowed land. This work should be completed before the end of March. All deeply plowed land should be plowed, harrowed, and rolled at the same time, striving to make the land as flat as a mirror and the ridges and furrows like lines. 2. Ensure sufficient base fertilizer is applied. Generally, apply about 30,000 jin of manure and compost per mu of ordinary land, and at least 50,000 jin per mu of high-yield land, applying it in deep layers or deep in furrows. 3. Strive to irrigate all cotton fields once and plant cotton on the basis of sufficient and good moisture. 4. Fully realize the use of improved varieties, ensuring that each mu of cotton field retains an average of one and a half sets of seeds. 5. Reasonably close planting, requiring appropriate widening of row spacing and narrowing of plant spacing for dry land, retaining 5,000 to 6,000 seedlings per mu. Use wide and narrow row planting for paddy fields, retaining 4,000 to 5,000 seedlings per mu. 6. Implement row sowing and eliminate large plow-furrow sowing. Vigorously promote north-south rows to facilitate ventilation and light transmission. Ensure uniform sowing, no breaks in the rows, and no missed sowing. 7. Seeds must be selected (grain selection), dried (dried for about three days), soaked (warm water soaking), and mixed (treated with Ceresan) before sowing, striving to have every seed sprout. 8. Sow early at the right time. After the cotton seedlings emerge, prevent and control pests and diseases in a timely manner.

This year, the cotton planting preparation work in various parts of Shaanxi is more solid and meticulous than in previous years. At present, the deep plowing of cotton fields throughout the province has been basically completed, most of the base fertilizer has been applied, and one-half of the cotton fields have been irrigated. The land preparation is also flatter than in previous years, achieving loose top and firm bottom, with no clods of soil on the ground. In pest control, various places have successively removed weeds from the five edges (well edges, village edges, road edges, field edges, grave edges) and sprayed elm trees, alfalfa, pomegranate trees, and other places prone to breeding cotton pests with pesticide powder.

    要粒粒棉籽都出苗
    山东在临清召开现场会加强备耕工作
    陕西制定八项技术措施提高播种质量
    本报济南1日电　山东省在临清市召开棉花现场会议，推广临清市棉花播种准备工作经验，进一步研究了如何种好棉花，确保一次全苗。
    盛产棉花的临清市在1958年大丰收的基础上，对今年棉花播种的准备工作搞得特别好。这个市今年计划播种棉花五十万亩，亩产籽棉一千斤，其中搞大面积丰产田二十五万亩，亩产籽棉一千五百斤。为了实现这个宏伟的跃进指标，他们在去冬就提出了早规划、早安排、抢时间、争主动，一次播种，苗全齐旺的要求，因此，这个市的播种准备工作已成为全省的标兵。全市的各人民公社从去年12月就从上到下对1959年计划指标开展了鸣放辩论，通过辩论使计划在群众中扎下根。接着各级党委带动十万多名劳动大军，大搞棉田深翻，经过五十天的艰苦奋战，五十万亩棉田全部耕翻八寸以上。随翻地随施肥，现在一般每亩已施底肥二、三万斤，比去年增加三至四倍。当前又突出地抓住保墒问题，所有棉田的水利条件也准备得很好，全市除五万零三百四十九眼机井、水井外，又修了大小干渠四处，各级渠道二千三百八十条，水源充沛，天不下雨也可以保证棉花大丰收。在这即将播种的时刻，各公社还开展了群众性的培育棉苗的运动。在这同时还组织了一千多名铁木工大修农具，并且训练了大批的技术员，分片包干进行管理。
    这个市去年曾获得无虫市的光荣称号，对棉花增产作用很大。今年他们开展了两次灭虫战役，消灭了大量的越冬害虫。现在各社、队已备足各种农药，准备将病虫害消灭在棉田以外。各地代表们参观了这个市的棉花播种的各项准备工作，莫不连声称赞，大受鼓舞。会议经过参观介绍，交流经验，增强了到会代表对棉花大丰收的信心。

    本报西安1日电　陕西省在3月21日到23日举行的全省棉花会议上，根据已往经验制订了今年播种棉花的八大技术措施。会议决定立即在全省范围内进行一次检查和验收工作，进一步推广张秋香的植棉技术。
    会议制定的八大技术措施是：一、把全部棉花种在深翻的土地上，这项工作在3月底以前全部结束。所有深翻过的土地都随翻、随耙、随耱，争取作到地平如镜，垅沟似线。二、保证施足底肥，一般田每亩施圈肥、堆肥三万斤左右，丰产田至少施五万斤，分层深施或开沟深施。三、争取全部棉田灌溉一次，把棉花种在墒饱、墒好的基础上。四、全部实现良种化，保证每亩棉田平均留足一套半种子。五、合理密植，要求旱地适当放宽行距，缩小株距，每亩留苗五千到六千株。水地用宽窄行播种，每亩留苗四千到五千株。六、实行条播，消灭大犁溜种。大力推行南北行，以利通风透光。保证做到下种均匀，不断条，不漏播。七、种子下种前必须进行选（粒选）、晒（晒三天左右）、浸（温汤浸种）、拌（赛力散拌种），争取种一粒出一粒。八、适时早播。棉苗出土后，要及时防治病虫害。
    今年陕西各地的棉花备耕工作比往年扎实、细致。目前，全省棉田已经基本深翻完毕，大部分施了底肥，有二分之一的棉田进行了灌溉。土地的整理也较往年平整，做到了上松下实、地无土块。在防虫工作上，各地先后铲除了五边（井边、村边、路边、地边、坟边）杂草，用药粉喷洒了榆树、苜蓿、石榴树等容易孳生棉花害虫的地方。
