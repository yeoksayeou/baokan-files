Factory Among the Green Trees

　　Clusters of white clouds, clumps of green trees, and children strolling along tree-lined paths. This is not a park, nor is it a sanatorium, but the factory buildings and residences of the Shanxi Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory.

　　Who would have thought that before 1952, this was still a desolate wilderness? In spring, sandstorms assaulted the area; in summer, the scorching sun blazed down. Where could green shade be found? In 1952, along with the establishment of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, all the factory workers began planting trees and making forests. After six or seven years of hard work, what is presented before people's eyes is these clumps and forests of pines, cypresses, and poplars... Sandstorms and scorching sun have lost their former power here.

　　绿树丛中的工厂
    一簇簇白云，一丛丛绿树，林荫道上，孩子们在散步。这里不是公园，也不是疗养所，而是山西经纬纺织机械厂的厂房和住所。
    谁会想到，在一九五二年以前，这里还是一片荒凉的旷野，春天，风沙袭人；夏天，赤日炎炎，哪里有绿荫可寻？一九五二年，在建立经纬纺织机械厂的同时，全厂职工就开始了植树造林。经过六、七年的辛勤劳动，呈现在人们眼前的，就是这成丛成林的松柏和杨柳，……风沙和烈日，在这里已失去了当年的威风了。
