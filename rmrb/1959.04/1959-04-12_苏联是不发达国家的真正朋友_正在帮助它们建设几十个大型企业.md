Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th - According to the Soviet "Labor News," the Soviet Union is increasingly expanding its assistance to underdeveloped countries in establishing national industries. According to technical assistance agreements signed between governments, the Soviet Union is helping these countries build dozens of large enterprises.

The Soviet Union has signed technical assistance agreements with countries such as India, the United Arab Republic, Afghanistan, Ceylon, Burma, Indonesia, Yemen, and Iraq.

In order to help India establish a national heavy industry, the Soviet Union is vigorously assisting India in building a large steel plant in Bhilai with an annual output of one million tons of steel. The first blast furnace, coking oven, central thermal power station, and some auxiliary projects of this steel plant have already been put into production. The Soviet Union will help India build a heavy machinery manufacturing plant and a mining equipment manufacturing plant. The heavy machinery manufacturing plant will produce enough equipment annually to equip a metallurgical enterprise with an annual production capacity of one million tons; the mining equipment manufacturing plant can produce equipment to equip twenty mines within a year. In addition, the Soviet Union will also help India build optical glass manufacturing and other enterprises, as well as a thermal power plant with a generating capacity of 250,000 kilowatts, some coal mines, and other industrial projects. Soviet experts have also helped India discover industrial natural gas fields in Punjab and rich oil deposits in Bombay.

In the Syrian and Egyptian regions of the United Arab Republic, the Soviet Union will help build textile factories, oil refineries, chemical plants, and machine manufacturing plants, and will help build a hydroelectric power station with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts and railways on the Euphrates River. An agreement has been signed to help build the Aswan High Dam. After the completion of the oil refinery built with Soviet assistance, the United Arab Republic will no longer need to import petroleum products; the completion of the Alexandria shipyard will lay the foundation for the UAR's own shipbuilding industry.

The Soviet Union has agreed to help Indonesia build two small steel mills. In addition, it will also help it build a superphosphate factory, approximately 700 kilometers of roads, and two mechanized rice farms. Furthermore, twelve ships will be given to Indonesia in the form of loans.

With the help of Soviet experts, Ceylon is using Soviet machinery to clear 5,000 hectares of jungle. Currently, the Soviet Union is also helping Ceylon prepare for the construction of Ceylon's first steel plant, a factory for manufacturing automobile tires from natural rubber, and other projects.

Yemen, with Soviet assistance, is building the port of Hodeida, which can accommodate ocean-going vessels.

According to the agreement recently signed between Iraq and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will help Iraq build steel mills, machine manufacturing plants, chemical plants, as well as light industrial and food industrial enterprises.

In Burma, a technical college and hospital accommodating one thousand students are being built with Soviet assistance. Cambodia is also building a large hospital with Soviet assistance.

    苏联同印度、阿拉伯联合共和国、阿富汗 、锡兰、缅甸、印度尼西亚、也门、伊拉克等国都签订了技术援助协定。
    为了帮助印度建立民族重工业，苏联正在大力帮助印度在比莱建设一个年产一百万吨钢的大型钢铁厂。这个钢铁厂的第一号高炉、炼焦炉、中央热电站和一些辅助工程，目前已经投入生产。苏联将帮助印度建设一个重型机器制造厂和一个矿山设备制造厂，这个重型机器制造厂每年生产的设备，足够装备一个年生产能力为一百万吨的冶金企业；那个矿山设备制造厂一年之内生产的设备可以装备二十个矿井。此外，苏联还将帮助印度建设光学玻璃制造等企业以及一个发电能力为二十五万瓩的火力发电站、一些煤矿和其他工业工程。苏联专家还帮助印度在旁遮普邦发现了工业用的天然瓦斯产地，在孟买邦找到了石油富藏。
    在阿拉伯联合共和国的叙利亚地区和埃及地区，苏联将帮助建设纺织厂、炼油厂、化工厂和机器制造厂，将帮助在幼发拉底河上建设发电能力为十万瓩的水力发电站、铁路。签订了帮助建筑阿斯旺高水坝的协定。苏联帮助建设的炼油厂建成后，阿拉伯联合共和国将完全不需要进口石油产品；亚历山大港造船厂的建成将为阿联本国的造船工业奠定基础。
    苏联已经同意帮助印度尼西亚建设两个小型炼钢厂。此外，还将帮助它建设一个过磷酸钙工厂以及约七百公里长的公路和两个种植稻子的机械化农场。此外，还以贷款形式交给印度尼西亚十二艘船只。
    在苏联专家的帮助下，锡兰正利用苏联的机器展开了清除五千公顷丛林的工作。目前，苏联还帮助锡兰筹建锡兰第一个钢铁厂、用天然橡胶制造汽车轮胎的工厂和其他项目。
    也门在苏联的帮助下，正在建设荷台达大海港，这个海港可以吞吐远洋轮船。
    根据伊拉克和苏联最近签订的协定，苏联将帮助伊拉克建设钢铁厂、机器制造厂、化工厂以及轻工业和食品工业企业。
