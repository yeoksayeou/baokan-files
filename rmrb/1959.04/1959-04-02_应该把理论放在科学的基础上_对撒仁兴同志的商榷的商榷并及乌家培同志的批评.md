After I published the article "Further Discussion on Eliminating Bourgeois Rights," Comrades Sa Renxing and Wu Jiapei raised objections to it. Problems always become clearer with more discussion. I welcome opinions from anyone. Here are my views.

I believe Comrades Sa and Wu have misunderstood my article. They made a big fuss about this paragraph from my article: "Regarding the direct relationship between capitalists and workers, the amount of wages they pay to this or that worker is, in principle, measured by the worker's labor, that is, 'how much work you do, how much money you get,' either calculated by labor days or by the quantity of products; more work, more pay; less work, less pay..." Their articles are mainly based on this paragraph. However, before this paragraph, I clearly stated my premise. That passage was: "...Only in capitalist society do the bourgeoisie use the method of 'equal exchange' to purchase the labor power of hired workers, producing surplus value for them. Exploiting surplus value—this is the secret of the bourgeoisie's unearned wealth..." Then, I said: "The bourgeoisie gets rich by exploiting the surplus value of hired workers. However, as everyone knows, the surplus labor that produces surplus value is mixed with the necessary labor that produces the materials needed for the hired worker's family life, that is, the value of labor power. Therefore,..." This ellipsis is where Comrades Sa and Wu quoted from. I believe that "the bourgeoisie uses the method of 'equal exchange' to purchase the labor power of hired workers" indicates that labor power has become a commodity. The statement that "the surplus labor that produces surplus value is mixed with the necessary labor that produces the value of labor power" includes the meaning that wages are the price of labor power. But Comrades Sa and Wu completely disregarded this part, and therefore, they also omitted the connecting word "therefore" that precedes the passage they quoted. Why did they do this? Only they themselves can answer.

After presenting all of this as a premise, I said: "Regarding the direct relationship between capitalists and workers, the amount of wages he pays to this or that worker is measured by labor." A ruler is a measuring tool, and its function is to measure how many units something (like cloth) has. Here, "how much work you do, how much money you get" refers to how many units of work you do, how many units of money you get. As for how much money is given for one unit, that is, whether the capitalist pays the worker the full value of what he produces, that is another matter. It is precisely because I was referring to "measured by labor," that is, the wage form in which wages increase or decrease in direct proportion to labor, that I said, "This method of 'payment according to labor'..." At the time, I also considered: Is it good to say it this way? I also learned from Marx that there was originally a "contradiction between principle and practice" in the world, that is, there is a set of contradictions like "contradiction between principle and practice" and "unity of principle and practice." Therefore, I believed that the "distribution according to labor" implemented in capitalist society among workers is a "distribution according to labor" with a "contradiction between principle and practice." Therefore, I said in this passage "...in principle, measured by the worker's labor..." and then said: "Under these conditions (private ownership changed to public ownership), the contradiction between the principle and practice of 'distribution according to labor' is eliminated, and it is no longer a method for the exploiting classes to exploit the working people (capitalist exploitation), but becomes the main principle for distribution among the working people." Isn't this very clear? But Comrades Sa and Wu, for some reason, did not pay attention to this passage either. As for the principle mentioned later when discussing whether "distribution according to labor" is opposed to the capitalist principle of distribution, it of course also refers to the principle of "measured by labor" that extracts the content of whether the distribution is equal to the production earnings. In short, in my article, as long as Comrades Sa and Wu were more responsible, the meaning would be very clear. Precisely because they did not do this, the articles they wrote, especially Comrade Wu's article, have little to do with my article, and therefore the batch of "hats" that Comrade Wu threw at me, which seemed to be his only weapons, such as "politically harmful," "comforting workers," "helping the bourgeoisie to corrupt the revolutionary consciousness of workers," "putting lipstick on capitalist society," etc., did not land on my head but fell on the empty ground.

I believe that discussion is to clarify the problem, and one should not take excerpts from other people's articles out of context to create one's own article, because that is not in line with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts.

But the problem needs further discussion.

      In capitalist society, laborers are severely exploited, but it cannot be said
  that laborers do not participate in social distribution at that time.

I believe that as scientific research, it is strange that Comrade Sa does not find it strange to say that the principle of distribution in capitalist society is unearned wealth and labor without gain, but finds it strange that I say that it is not the principle of distribution in capitalist society. Why does he say this? This time, following his prompt, I looked at Sa's "On Breaking the Bourgeois Rights Concept." Only then did I realize that he originally advocated that the principle of distribution in capitalist society is unearned wealth and labor without gain.

I believe that our class stance is consistent with our scientific stance, and our revolutionary spirit is unified with our scientific spirit. Therefore, in discussing problems, we must hold a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. The reason why I said "unearned wealth, labor without gain" is not the principle of distribution in capitalist society is because, first, in capitalist society, laborers are severely exploited, but it cannot be generally said that labor is without gain. Second, unearned wealth and labor without gain are not unique characteristics of capitalist society, because they are phenomena common to all private ownership societies. Comrade Sa defended his argument, saying: Workers obtain wages, "essentially it should be said 'labor without gain,' because the wages workers receive are the price they sell their labor power for, and they are completely separated from the fruits of their own labor." So that is how labor without gain is explained! No wonder he doesn't admit that workers participate in social distribution in capitalist society. Comrade Sa said: "Workers cannot participate in the distribution of the value they create through their own labor. They can only obtain in advance the wages they exchange for selling their labor power." Although when he put forward the original argument "distribution according to labor power" to oppose the saying "distribution according to labor", he said that workers were "distributed" to a certain amount of means of subsistence. But that "distribution" is in quotation marks. Later, he said more clearly: "The scale of capitalist distribution of wealth appreciation is the possession of the means of production. Because the working class does not possess the means of production, it does not have the right to participate in distribution." What is the meaning of "wealth appreciation" here? Does it refer to surplus value? Workers certainly do not participate in the distribution of surplus value. But is the discussion of social distribution only about the distribution of surplus value? Political economy textbooks refer to distribution as the distribution of national income among members of society. If these political economy textbooks are correct, then, as everyone knows, whether wages are paid in advance or afterwards, as far as social distribution is concerned, the wages workers receive are always a part of the value created by the workers, a part of the national income. How can it be said that workers do not participate in the social distribution? It is true that wages are the price of workers selling their labor power, but as far as social distribution is concerned, production workers participate in social distribution in the form of obtaining wages. This distribution is extremely unfair. But workers do participate after all. The Soviet-published "Political Economy Textbook" says: "Under the capitalist system, the distribution of national income is determined by the fact that the ownership of the means of production is concentrated in the hands of capitalists and landlords who exploit the proletariat and peasants. Therefore, the distribution of national income is unfavorable to laborers and favorable to the exploiting classes." Very clearly, the distribution is unfavorable to laborers, not that laborers do not participate in distribution. It can be seen that denying the participation of workers in social distribution in capitalist society is unscientific.

        "Distribution according to capital" is correct in one sense, but using it to generalize the distribution of
  capitalist society is incorrect.

After Comrade Sa completely denied the participation of laborers in social distribution, he put forward his argument that capitalist society is "distribution according to capital." This argument is correct in one sense. But using it to summarize the distribution of the entire capitalist society is incorrect. According to Comrade Sa's statement, so-called distribution according to capital refers to the fact that society uses the possession of the means of production as the scale to carry out distribution. In this way, first, laborers do not have the means of production, and measured by this scale, it is zero, so they cannot obtain distribution. As mentioned above, this is inappropriate. Second, according to that statement, "distribution according to capital" is also the principle of distribution in slave society and feudal society. But Marx said: "The distribution relationship is only one side of the expression of the production relationship, and the capitalist distribution is different from the distribution form generated by other production methods." (See "Capital") According to Comrade Sa's statement, what is the difference between the distribution of the three private ownership societies?

Comrade Sa said that my counter-evidence—if it is said that "distribution according to labor is the negation of the capitalist principle of distribution or the negation of bourgeois rights, then, when the principle of distribution according to need is implemented in the communist stage, it is the negation of the negation of the capitalist principle of distribution or bourgeois rights"—is using "confused logical reasons" and is a "mess." Okay, let's say my logic is confused! We can look at how it is according to Comrade Sa's statement. According to Comrade Sa's statement, slave society, feudal society, and capitalist society share a principle of distribution. The principle of distribution of these three private ownership societies has no "negation" at all. Only the principles of distribution in the two stages of communist society have negation. The principle of distribution in its lower stage negates the principle of distribution in capitalist society, and the principle of distribution in its higher stage is both the negation of the principle of distribution in its lower stage and the negation of the principle of distribution in capitalist society, that is, the principle of distribution in slave society and feudal society. Such clear logic makes people's minds confused.

Moreover, from the counter-evidence Comrade Sa put forward when refuting my above words: "That is like saying that socialism is the negation of the negation of feudal society, which cannot be established," it also exposed another viewpoint of Comrade Sa, that is: he completely equated the relationship between the two stages of communism with the relationship between the three societies of private ownership. This is also inappropriate.

What makes Comrade Sa so embarrassed? Where is the key to the problem?

The key lies in the fact that Comrade Sa denies that the working people participate in social distribution in capitalist society, and only pays attention to the generality of things in the distribution problem, while ignoring its particularity. Chairman Mao said: "For every form of motion of matter, we must pay attention to the common points between it and other forms of motion. But, especially important, the thing that becomes the basis of our understanding of things, is that we must pay attention to its special points, that is, pay attention to the difference in quality between it and other forms of motion. Only by paying attention to this point is it possible to distinguish things." (See "On Contradiction," emphasis added by the author). Comrade Sa has an article "On the Question of Equality" in the second issue of "Philosophical Research" published this year, criticizing the view that "the core of bourgeois rights is the hierarchy system," saying that this view only has a "treat all the same" view for bourgeois rights and feudal rights, and does not have a "different" view, so it is not comprehensive. I think Comrade Sa's statement is correct. But in that article and his this article, the principle of distribution in capitalist society is simply said to be "distribution according to capital." In this way, in the distribution problem, he only has "treat all the same" and does not have "different" for the three societies of private ownership. That is to say, Comrade Sa's method of observing problems is contradictory before and after. We can only say that capitalist society is first distributed according to capital, but we cannot say that all is distributed according to capital. Comrade Sa's simplification of the principle of distribution in capitalist society as "distribution according to capital" is obviously incorrect.

Distribution is the distribution of the means of production, so it is subject to the specific conditions of production. And to achieve production, there must be production conditions: means of production and labor power. Since the emergence of private ownership society, the means of production have been monopolized by the exploiting classes. The class that monopolizes the means of production is also the ruling class in politics. In this way, the working people, in order to seek means of subsistence and carry out production, cannot but be constrained by the class that occupies the means of production. Therefore, the class that occupies the means of production can occupy (that is, exploit) the products produced by the working people according to its occupation of the means of production. In this sense, in class society, products are first distributed according to the situation of occupying the means of production. Capitalist society is like this, and so are feudal society and slave society. Therefore, it is said that distributing products according to the situation of occupying the means of production is primary, but it is common to the three private ownership societies. This is consistent with the view that maintaining private property is the most fundamental, but also common, thing about the rights of these three private ownership societies. But this is only one side of the matter.

      What capitalist society implements among the working people is a "distribution according to labor" with "contradiction between principle and practice."

On the other hand, how the exploiting classes exploit the laborers, and what form the vast number of working people obtain distribution in, are different in the three societies. This is determined by the other side of the relations of production, that is, the specific relationship between the exploiting classes and the working people. In slave society, the slave owners have a personal possession relationship with the slaves; in feudal society, the feudal class has a semi-possession relationship with the peasants, so the distribution methods that adapt to these relationships arise. I mentioned these briefly in that article. Now, let's talk only about capitalist society. In this society, the bourgeoisie no longer has a relationship of personal possession with the laborers. Therefore, the way the bourgeoisie exploits the laborers, and the way capitalist society carries out social distribution among the working people, are also different from the previous two societies. The bourgeoisie purchases the labor power of the workers by means of "equal exchange," and produces surplus value for them. That is to say, the bourgeoisie exploits the working people, generally speaking, not through extra-economic coercion, but through economic means. Its politics are tools to maintain this exploitation in an economic way. Wages are the price of labor power, and the social wage level is determined by the law of value, but the price of this labor power is realized through the measure of labor.

      "It's measured by labor again, and he's still defending the bourgeoisie!"—Comrade Wu would say this.

It seems that it is impossible not to give examples here. Then let's give examples. For example: according to the law of value, the price of a worker's labor power is 1.2 yuan per day. How does the capitalist pay him this price? He must work fourteen or twelve hours to pay him this price. Let's take twelve hours as an example, then the capitalist can determine that one hour of work is worth 0.1 yuan. In this way, a worker must work twelve hours a day to get this 1.2 yuan, that is to say, through the measure of labor, the law of value of labor power is realized. If, as Comrade Sa said, it is "distribution according to labor power" or his "exact" statement: "They obtain the minimum means of subsistence that can maintain life and continue offspring according to the price of labor power." Then, as everyone knows, if a worker works eight or ten hours a day, he will not eat less because he works four or two hours less, his housing expenses will be less, and the natural needs of his son's (offspring's) belly will also be less. That is to say, the price of the worker's labor power is still the same as in the past. According to Comrade Sa's statement, a worker who works eight or ten hours a day would also be given 1.2 yuan. But this is something everyone knows is not the case. The fact is that if he works eight or ten hours, he can only get 0.8 yuan or 1 yuan. At this time, their whole family can only further tighten their belts. What is the meaning of Comrade Sa's "distribution according to labor power" or that "exact" statement? Isn't it the capitalist who uses labor as a measure to force the worker to carry out the highest intensity of labor in order to obtain the price of his labor power? Is it scientific for Comrades Sa and Wu to deny this "measured by labor"? Is that the steadiest position? But please rest assured, Comrade Sa, I will not be as undiscriminating as Comrade Wu, saying that you are putting lipstick on the bourgeoisie. I think you are only temporarily inconsiderate.

      "Marx said: The more he works, the less wages he gets."—Comrade Wu said again.

Yes, Marx said that. But does that mean that in the same time, under the same standard, the more you work, the less you get paid? Does Marx mean that wages and labor are inversely proportional? Of course, he means that in capitalist society, as long as the labor intensity of a considerable number of workers reaches a new and higher level, the capitalist will reduce the unit price of wages for making each product. But under the new standard of unit price, the relationship between wages and labor is still a proportional relationship. The capitalist's exploitation of surplus value does not arise from this proportional relationship where wages and labor are proportional to each other, but arises from the actual difference between the value produced by each unit of labor and the wages obtained by this unit under this proportional relationship. Therefore, another aspect of wages being proportional to labor is that surplus value is also proportional to labor. How can the fact that the capitalist pays workers wages "measured by labor" be understood as only referring to the fact that the wages workers receive are equal to the value produced by their labor, and therefore think that saying "measured by labor" means that the bourgeoisie has not exploited them? On the contrary, I believe that this "payment according to labor" by the bourgeoisie is precisely a means for the bourgeoisie to force the laborers to carry out high-intensity labor and to cruelly exploit the laborers by economic means.

From the perspective of the mode of exploitation, using this method of "payment according to labor" to exploit the laborers; from the perspective of social distribution, using this method of "distribution according to labor" to carry out distribution among the working people, in terms of social universality, is unique to capitalist society. This is indeed the material basis of that "equality," that is, false equality, which is a characteristic of bourgeois rights. That "equality" which is a characteristic of bourgeois rights, first of all reflects this situation. Therefore, it is not wrong to say that it is bourgeois rights. The following sentence of Marx's in "Critique of the Gotha Program," which Comrade Sa quoted: "This equal right is still restricted by the bourgeois scope in one aspect," is followed by "the right of the producers is proportional to the labor they supply; equality lies in measuring with an equal scale—labor." This sentence was again "neglected" by Comrade Sa, but I think this sentence is precisely the explanation of the above sentence.

However, from another point of view, this "distribution according to labor" implemented by the bourgeoisie among the working people is a "distribution according to labor" with "contradiction between principle and practice," that is to say, this "distribution according to labor" hides the bourgeoisie's serious exploitation of the laborers. What the capitalists pay to the workers seems to be the wages for one day's labor, but in reality, it is the value produced by the workers in half a day (for example), that is to say, what the laborers get through this "distribution according to labor" is only the value of labor power, not the value of labor. Half or most of the value produced by their labor (for example, the value produced in that half day) is quietly taken away by the capitalist in the form of surplus value. The separation of principle and practice is a prominent feature of exploiting society, especially capitalist society. Isn't this a fact?

Let me say it again: the principle of distribution in capitalist society among the working people is only the principle of what is used as a measure, which is "distribution according to labor." But in terms of the distribution obtained and the labor obtained, it is seriously inconsistent, so this "distribution according to labor" is a "distribution according to labor" with "contradiction between principle and practice."

      Socialist society transforms "distribution according to labor" from "contradiction between principle and practice"
  to "unity of principle and practice."

      "No, no! It is unimaginable for two modes of production to share a form of distribution. Only bourgeois economists would say that!" Comrade Wu might be angry.

It should be pointed out that things here are not unimaginable, but Comrade Wu himself has not imagined them carefully. Socialist society abolished private ownership, thus transforming the situation of "distribution according to labor" from a situation of "contradiction between principle and practice" to a situation of "unity of principle and practice." Is "distribution according to labor" with "contradiction between principle and practice" and "distribution according to labor" with "unity of principle and practice" a form of distribution? I feel that transforming "distribution according to labor" from a situation of "contradiction between principle and practice" to a situation of "unity of principle and practice," that is, freeing the working people from the position of being exploited, is an earth-shaking change. This is the result of the working people's years of bloodshed and sacrifice. Saying this does not underestimate the superiority of socialism in the slightest, nor does it confuse the boundaries between capitalism and socialism, but when it comes to the principle of distributing "measured by labor," we have basically not changed it. We will transform it into "measured by need," but because of various specific conditions, first of all, because products have not yet been greatly enriched and the ideological awareness and moral character of the people have not yet been greatly improved, this transformation cannot be realized now. Therefore, this "distribution according to labor" with "unity of principle and practice" is the main principle of distribution in the first stage of communism, that is, socialist society. This "distribution according to labor" is the principle of distribution that is unique to socialist society.

I believe that in speculation, we should always pay attention to Chairman Mao's method of concrete analysis of contradictions. What and what are a set of contradictions? What is the relationship between this set of contradictions and that set of contradictions? This should be clarified first, otherwise the concepts will be mixed and it will be impossible to distinguish between right and wrong. What is used as the scale of distribution, such as distribution according to capital, distribution according to labor, and distribution according to need, is a set of contradictions. Under the distribution of "measured by labor," that is, "distribution according to labor," is the distribution obtained the full value of its production? Such as: "not the full value of its production," that is, "contradiction between principle and practice," and "is the full value of its production," that is, "unity of principle and practice," is another set of contradictions. Obviously, this set of contradictions is subordinate to the distribution of "measured by labor," that is, "distribution according to labor." Socialism transformed that general "distribution according to capital" (which also existed in slave society and feudal society) that existed among the exploiting classes into "distribution according to labor," and those who do not work will not eat. However, the principle of "measured by labor," that is, "distribution according to labor," which is unique to capitalist society among the working people, has only been transformed from a situation of "contradiction between principle and practice" to a situation of "unity of principle and practice." This situation precisely illustrates that socialist society is a society that has just emerged from capitalist society, and inevitably retains some traces of capitalist society on its body; and the "distribution according to labor" in the true sense also has a development process, and did not fall from the sky. It is not in line with the historical and scientific point of view to say that socialism transforms "distribution according to labor" from "contradiction between principle and practice" to "unity of principle and practice" and must say that this principle of distribution of "measured by labor" was something that fell to the earth the day private property was abolished. Is that unswerving Marxism?

It should also be stated that my article only argued about the relationship between the "distribution according to labor" in socialist society and the "distribution according to labor" with "measured by labor" carried out among the working people in capitalist society, after taking it for granted that the bourgeoisie exploited the laborers and occupied a large amount of social wealth. Therefore, I said: "It cannot be said that 'distribution according to labor' is the negation of the capitalist principle of distribution..." If the "distribution according to capital" carried out among the bourgeoisie is also included, then this statement should be changed to "It cannot be said that 'distribution according to labor' is the negation of the principle of distribution carried out among the working people in capitalist society." But the problem is not that Comrades Sa and Wu pointed out that my original formulation was not complete enough, but that Comrades Sa and Wu, after distorting the meaning of my article, fundamentally did not recognize the existence of "distribution measured by labor" among the working people in capitalist society. And Comrade Sa has a series of views that seem inconsistent with science. To summarize these views, they are: fundamentally do not recognize that wages, from the perspective of social distribution issues, are a form of distribution carried out among the working people in capitalist society; fundamentally do not recognize that the working people participate in social distribution in capitalist society; fundamentally oppose the fact that the wage level in capitalist society is based on the value of labor power as a guideline and that the embodiment of this law is that wages are paid measured by labor, and therefore fundamentally do not recognize that capitalists pay wages "measured by labor," that is, in direct proportion to labor; In order to oppose distribution "measured by labor", he proposed "distribution according to labor power" or his so-called "exact" statement, thus denying the fact that the bourgeoisie forced the laborers to carry out high-intensity labor through the method of paying wages "measured by labor"; He made an arbitrary conclusion that "wages under capitalism have nothing to do with 'distribution according to labor'"; Due to neglecting the particularity of capitalism and denying the participation of the vast number of working people in social distribution, the principle of distribution in capitalist society is simply said to be "distribution according to capital"; The relationship between the two stages of communism, which were just produced by capitalist society and developed on their own basis, is completely equated with the relationship between the three societies of private ownership, and so on. It can be seen from this that the "titles" such as "confused logic", "absurd", "mess", and "very problematic" given to my article by Comrade Sa should be added to whose article cannot be determined by Comrade Sa alone, but should be determined by objective facts.

If there are any inappropriate points in the above comments, I hope Comrades Sa and Wu will correct them.

    应该把理论放在科学的基础上
    ——对撒仁兴同志的商榷的商榷并及乌家培同志的批评
    郑季翘
    在我发表了“再谈削除资产阶级法权”的文章后，撒仁兴同志和乌家培同志对这篇文章提出了意见。问题总是越讨论越明白。对于任何人的意见，我都是欢迎的。下边说一说我的意见。
    我认为撒、乌二同志对我的文章有误会。他们引来大作文章的是我的文章的这一段：“就资本家与工人的直接关系来说，他们付给这个工人或那个工人多少工资，原则上则是以工人的劳动为尺度，即‘做多少活，给多少钱’，或以劳动日计，或以产品数量计，多做多给，少做少给……。”他们的文章，主要是根据这一段做出来的。但是，在这段文字之前，我很清楚地摆出我的前提。那段话是：“……只有到了资本主义社会，资产阶级用‘等价交换’的方式，购买雇佣工人的劳动力，为他们生产剩余价值。剥削剩余价值——这是资产阶级不劳而获的秘密……”接着，我说：“资产阶级是用剥削雇佣工人的剩余价值的办法来发财致富的。但是，大家知道，生产剩余价值的剩余劳动和生产雇佣工人家庭生活需用的物资即劳动力的价值的必要劳动是混和在一起的。所以，……”这划删节号的地方，才是撒、乌两同志所引的那一段。我认为“资产阶级用‘等价交换’的方式，购买雇佣工人的劳动力”，就说明劳动力成为商品了。“生产剩余价值的剩余劳动和生产劳动力的价值的必要劳动混和在一起”的话，就包含了工资是劳动力的价格的意义了。但撒、乌二同志却根本不要这段文字，因而连他们所引的那段文字前面的那个连接词“所以”也不要了。他们为什么这样做呢？那只有他们自己才能回答。
    在把这一切当作前提提出之后，我才说：“就资本家和工人的直接关系来说，他付给这个工人或那个工人多少工资，则是以劳动为尺度的”。尺是一个量具，它的作用是量物（如布）有多少个单位。这里“做多少活，给多少钱”，就是指做多少个单位的活，给多少个单位的钱，至于一个单位给多少钱，也就是说，资本家给工人的工资是不是他所生产的全部价值，那是另外一回事。正因为我所指的是“以劳动为尺度”即工资与劳动按正比例增减的这个工资形态，所以我才说“这种‘按劳付酬’的办法……。”我当时也考虑：这样说好不好？又从马克思那里，知道世界上原来还有个“原则和实践的矛盾”，也就是说，还有“原则与实践矛盾”和“原则与实践统一”这样一组矛盾。因而，我认为资本主义社会在工人中所实行的那种“按劳分配”，是“原则和实践矛盾”的“按劳分配”。因此，才在这段文字里说“……原则上是以工人的劳动为尺度……”，稍后又说：“在这种条件下（私有制改为公有制），‘按劳分配’的原则和实践的矛盾消除了，就不再是剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的方式（资本主义剥削），而成为在劳动人民中进行分配的主要原则了”。这不很明白吗？而撒、乌两同志又不知因为什么原故，对这段文字也没有注意。至于后边在谈到“按劳分配”是不是和资本主义的分配原则相对立时所说的原则，当然也是指抽掉分配是否与生产所得相等的内容的那个“以劳动为尺度”的原则的。总之，我的那篇文章，只要撒、乌两同志更加负责一些，意思是很清楚的。正因为他们没有这样做，所以他们写出来的文章，特别是乌同志的文章，和我那篇文章关系并不大，因而乌同志向我投来的看来是他仅有的武器的那一批“帽子”，例如“政治上有害”呀，“安慰工人”、“帮助资产阶级腐蚀工人的革命意识”呀，“给资本主义社会擦脂抹粉”呀之类，就投不在我的头顶而纷纷落在空地上。
    我认为，讨论是为了把问题弄明白，不应对别人的文章断章取义，来作成自己的文章，因为那是不符合实事求是的科学精神的。
    但是问题还需要进一步讨论。
      在资本主义社会，劳动者是遭受严重剥削的，但不能说
  那时劳动者不参与社会分配
    我认为，作为科学研究，撒同志不认为说资本主义社会的分配原则是不劳而获，劳而不获为奇怪，却认为我说那不是资本主义社会的分配原则为奇怪，是奇怪的。他为什么这样说呢？这一次，遵照他的提示，我看了看撒著“论破除资产阶级法权观念”。才知道，原来他就是主张资本主义的分配原则是不劳而获，劳而不获的。
    我认为，我们的阶级立场与科学立场是一致的，我们的革命精神与科学精神是统一的。因此，在讨论问题中，必须抱持实事求是的科学态度。我所以说“不劳而获，劳而不获”不是资本主义的分配原则，因为第一，在资本主义社会，劳动者是遭受严重剥削的，但却不能一般地说劳而不获。第二，不劳而获，劳而不获也不是资本主义社会所独具的特征，因为那是所有私有制社会共有的现象。撒同志为他的主张辩护，说：工人获有工资，“实质上应该说是‘劳而不获’，因为工人所得的工资，是他们出卖劳动力的价格，他们与自己劳动创造的果实是完全脱离系关的”。原来劳而不获是这样解释的！怪不得他不承认在资本主义社会工人参与社会分配了。撒同志说过：“工人并不能参与他自己劳动所创造的价值的分配。他只能事先获得他出卖劳动力所换来的工资”。虽然他在为反对“按劳分配”的说法而提出那个独创的论点“按劳动力分配”时，说到工人被“分配”到一定生活资料。但那分配是划引号的。以后，他更明白地说：“资本主义分配财富增殖的尺度是生产资料的占有，工人阶级因为没有占有生产资料，所以没有参与分配的权利”。这里“财富增殖”的意思是什么？是指剩余价值么？工人当然不参与剩余价值的分配。但讲社会分配问题，就是只讲剩余价值的分配么？政治经济学教科书讲到分配，都是指国民收入在社会成员中的分配的。如果这些政治经济学教科书是对的话，那末，大家知道，不管工资是事先付，还是事后付，就社会分配来说，工人所得的工资，总是工人所创造的价值的一部分，国民收入的一部分。怎么能说工人不参与社会的分配呢？不错，工资是工人出卖劳动力的价格，但就社会分配来说，生产工人正是以获得工资的形式参与社会分配的。这种分配是极不公平的。但工人毕竟是参与的。苏联出版的那本“政治经济学教科书”上说：“在资本主义制度下，国民收入的分配是由生产资料所有权集中在剥削无产阶级和农民的资本家和地主手中这一点决定的。因此，国民收入的分配不利于劳动者，而有利于剥削阶级”。很明白，分配是对劳动者不利，而不是劳动者不参与分配。可见，否认资本主义社会的工人参与社会分配，是不合乎科学的。
        “按资分配”在一种意义上说是对的，但用它来概括资
  本主义社会的分配，却是不对的
    撒同志根本否认了劳动者参与社会分配之后，提出了他的资本主义社会是“按资分配”的论点，这个论点在一种意义上说是对的。但以它来概括全资本主义社会的分配，却是不对的。依据撒同志的说法，所谓按资分配是指社会以生产资料的占有状况为尺度来进行分配的。这样，第一，劳动者没有生产资料，以这个尺度去衡量是个零，所以就得不到分配。这在上面已经说过，是不妥当的。第二，按照那样的说法，则“按资分配”也是奴隶社会和封建社会的分配原则。但马克思说过：“分配关系不过是表示生产关系的一面而已，资本主义的分配，与由别种生产方式发生的分配形态是有区别的”。（见“资本论”）按照撒同志的说法，私有制三个社会的分配的区别到底在哪里呢？
    撒同志把我那段反证的话——如果说“按劳分配是资本主义分配原则的否定或资产阶级权利的否定，那末，到了共产主义阶段实行按需分配的分配原则时，便是资本主义分配原则或资产阶级权利的否定的否定了。”——说成是用了“混乱的逻辑上的理由”，是“乱套”。好，就算我的逻辑是混乱的吧！咱们可以按照撒同志的说法来看看怎样。按照撒同志的说法，则奴隶社会、封建社会和资本主义社会共有一个分配原则。这三个私有制社会的分配原则根本没有“否定”，唯独共产主义社会两个阶段的分配原则，它们有否定，而其低级阶段的分配原则否定了资本主义的分配原则，高级阶段的分配原则既是其低级阶段的分配原则的否定；又是资本主义的分配原则亦即奴隶社会和封建社会的分配原则的否定。这样的清晰的逻辑倒使人们的脑子陷入混乱之中了。
    而且，从撒同志反驳我以上的话时提出的反证：“那样如同说社会主义是封建社会的否定的否定，是不能成立的”这话里，也暴露了撒同志的另外一个观点，就是：他把共产主义的两个阶段的关系和私有制的三个社会的关系完全等同起来了。这也是不妥当的。
    什么东西使撒同志这样尴尬呢？问题的关键在什么地方呢？
    关键就在于撒同志否认在资本主义社会劳动人民参与社会分配，并在分配问题上只注意了事物的一般性，而忽略了它的特殊性。毛主席说：“对于物质的每一种运动形式，必须注意它和其他各种运动形式的共同点。但是，尤其重要的，成为我们认识事物的基础的东西，则是必须注意它的特殊点，就是说，注意它和其他运动形式的质的区别。只有注意了这一点，才有可能区别事物”。（见“矛盾论”，着重点是引者加的）。撒同志在今年出版的“哲学研究”第二期上有一篇文章“关于平等问题”，批判那种认为“资产阶级法权的核心是等级制度”的说法，说这种说法对于资产阶级法权和封建权利，只有“一视同仁”的观点，没有“有所不同”的观点，所以是不全面的。撒同志的这种说法，我认为是对的。但在那一篇文章和他的这一篇文章里，都把资本主义社会的分配原则，单纯地说成是“按资分配”，这样，在分配问题上，他对私有制的三个社会，只有“一视同仁”而没有“有所不同”了。也就是说，撒同志观察问题的方法前后矛盾了；我们只能说资本主义社会首先是按资分配而不能说全部是按资分配，撒同志把资本主义的分配原则单纯地归结为“按资分配”显然是不正确的。
    分配是对于生产品的分配，因此它服从于生产的具体状况。而实现生产，就需要有生产条件：生产资料和劳动力。自从私有制社会出现之后，生产资料就被剥削阶级垄断了。垄断生产资料的阶级同时是政治上的统治阶级。这样，劳动人民为了求得生活资料而进行生产，就不能不受占有生产资料的阶级的篐迫。从而占有生产资料的阶级就可以依据其占有生产资料的状况占有（即剥削）劳动人民生产出来的产品。在这一种意义上说，在阶级社会，首先是按照占有生产资料的状况进行分配的，资本主义社会是这样，封建社会、奴隶社会也是这样。所以说，按照生产资料占有的状况来分配产品是首先的，但却是三个私有制社会所共有的。这与所说的维护私有财产是这三个私有制社会的权利的最根本的、然而却是共同的东西的观点是一致的。但这只是事情的一面。
      资本主义社会在劳动人民中实行的是“原则和实践矛盾”
  的“按劳分配”
    另一方面，剥削阶级用一种怎样的办法来剥削劳动者，广大劳动人民由一种怎样的形式得到分配，则这三个社会是各不相同的。这是由生产关系的另一面即剥削阶级和劳动人民之间的具体关系来决定的。在奴隶社会，奴隶主对奴隶是人身占有的关系；在封建社会，封建阶级对农民是半占有的关系，因而就产生了与这些关系相适应的分配方式。这些我在那篇文章中简略地都提到了。现在单说资本主义社会。在这个社会里，资产阶级对于劳动者，不是人身占有的关系了。所以资产阶级剥削劳动者的方式，资本主义社会在劳动人民中间进行社会分配的方式，也就和前两个社会不同了。资产阶级以“等价交换”的办法，购买工人的劳动力，为他们生产剩余价值。也就是说，资产阶级剥削劳动人民，总的说来不是超经济的强制，而是用经济的方式了，其政治则是维护这种用经济方式进行剥削的工具。工资是劳动力的价格，社会的工资水平是为价值规律所决定的，但这劳动力的价格却是通过劳动的尺度来实现的。
      “又是以劳动为尺度，还在为资产阶级辩护！”——乌同志会这样说。
    看来，这里不举例说明是不行了。那就举例说明吧。例如：按照价值规律，工人劳动力的价格每天是一元二角，资本家怎样付给他这个价格呢？是要他工作十四小时或十二小时才付给他的。就以十二小时说吧，那么资本家就可确定劳动一小时，工资一角。这样一个工人每日必须工作十二小时才可以拿到这一元二角，也就是说，通过劳动的尺度，实现了劳动力的价值规律。如果如撒同志所说是“按劳动力分配”或者他的那个“确切”的说法：“他们按照劳动力的价格得到仅能维持生命和延续后代的最低限度的生活资料”。那末，大家知道，工人如果一天工作八小时或十小时，也不会因为他少工作了四小时或两小时，他自己就吃得少一些，他的住房用费就少一些，他的儿子（后代）的肚皮的自然需要也少一些，也就是说，工人的劳动力的价格和过去还是一样的。按照撒同志的说法，则一个工人每日工作八小时或十小时，资本家也给他一元二角钱。而这个，是谁都知道不是事实的，事实是如果他工作八小时或十小时，只能拿回八角钱或一元钱，这时，他们全家只有再进一步勒紧腰带了。撒同志的“按劳动力分配”或那个“确切”的说法，到底有什么意义呢？难道资本家不是用以劳动为尺度的办法，迫使工人进行最高强度的劳动，才获得他的劳动力的价格吗？撒、乌二同志否认这个
  “以劳动为尺度”，是科学的吗？那样就是立场最稳的吗？但是，请放心，撒同志，我不会如乌同志那样敌我不分，说你是给资产阶级擦脂抹粉。我认为你只是一时考虑不周。
      “马克思说过：他工作得愈多，他所得的工资愈少。”——乌同志又这样说。
    是的，马克思说过这样的话。但那是指在同一个时间内，同一个标准下，工作得愈多工资就愈少吗？难道马克思是指工资和劳动是反比例的关系吗？他当然是指在资本主义社会，只要相当多的工人的劳动强度达到新的更高的水平时，资本家就会降低制作每件产品的工资单价。但是在新的单价的标准下，工资和劳动的关系还是正比例的关系。资本家剥削剩余价值，不是产生于工资和劳动成正比例的这个比例关系上，而是产生于在这个比例关系之下，每个单位的劳动所生产的价值和这个单位所得工资的实际差额上。因此，工资与劳动成正比例的另一面，剩余价值也是与劳动成正比例的。怎么能够把资本家付给工人工资是“以劳动为尺度”这句话理解为只是指工人所得工资与其劳动所生产的价值相等，因而认为说“以劳动为尺度”就是指资产阶级没有剥削呢？相反，我认为：资产阶级的这个“按劳付酬”，正是资产阶级用经济的办法迫使劳动者进行高强度的劳动、对劳动者进行残酷剥削的手段。
    从剥削的方式来看，用这种“按劳付酬”的办法来剥削劳动者；从社会分配的角度来看，用这种“按劳分配”的办法来在劳动人民间进行分配，就社会的普遍性来说，是资本主义社会所特有的。这确是作为资产阶级权利的特征的那个“平等”即假平等的物质基础。作为资产阶级权利的特征的那个“平等”，首先是反映这种状况的。所以，说它是资产阶级权利，并不算错。撒同志引用的马克思在“哥达纲领批判”里的那一句话“这个平等的权利有一方面还仍然受着资产阶级范围的限制”的下面，接着就有“生产者们的权利是与他们供给的劳动成正比例的；平等就在于以平等的尺度——劳动——来计量”的话。这句话又被撒同志“疏忽”了，但我却认为这句话，正是上面那句话的解释。
    但是，从另一个角度来看，资产阶级在劳动人民中实行的这种“按劳分配”，是“原则和实践矛盾”的“按劳分配”，就是说，这个“按劳分配”里边，隐藏着资产阶级对于劳动者的严重的剥削，资本家付给工人看来是一天劳动的工资，实际是工人半天（比方）所生产的价值，也就是说劳动者们通过这个“按劳分配”所得到的，只是劳动力的价值，而不是劳动的价值。他们的劳动所生产的价值的一半或大部分（比如那半天所生产的价值）为资本家以剩余价值的形式悄悄地拿走了。原则上是“按劳分配”，实践上却不是真正的“按劳分配”。原则和实践的分离，是剥削社会，特别是资本主义社会的一个显著特点，这难道不是事实吗？
    再说一次：资本主义社会在劳动人民间进行分配的原则，仅仅是以什么为尺度的那个原则，是“按劳分配”。但就其分配所得和劳动所得来说，却是严重的不一致的，所以这种“按劳分配”是“原则和实践矛盾”的“按劳分配”。
      社会主义社会使“按劳分配”由“原则和实践矛盾”转
  化为“原则和实践统一”
      “不行，不行！两种生产方式共有一种分配形式，是不可想像的事情。只有资产阶级的经济学家才会那样说！”——乌同志可能要生气。
    应该指出，这里的事情并没有使人不可想像，而是乌同志自己没有去仔细想像。社会主义社会取消了私有制，因而使“按劳分配”由“原则和实践矛盾”的情况转化为“原则和实践统一”的情况。“原则和实践矛盾”的“按劳分配”和“原则和实践统一”的“按劳分配”，这是一种分配形式吗？我觉得使“按劳分配”由“原则和实践矛盾”的情况转化为“原则和实践统一”的情况，也就是说，使劳动人民脱离了被剥削的地位，这是翻天复地的变化。这是劳动人民多少年来流血流汗、牺牲奋斗的结果。这样说丝毫没有低估了社会主义的优越性，也没有混淆了资本主义和社会主义的界限，但是说到“以劳动为尺度”来进行分配的这个原则，我们现在还基本上没有把它改变。我们将要使它转化为“以需要为尺度”，但因为各种具体条件，首先是因为产品还没有极大的丰富和人民思想觉悟、道德品质还没有极大的提高，因而这种转化现在还不能实现。所以，这个“原则和实践统一”的“按劳分配”，就是我们在共产主义第一阶段即社会主义社会的主要的分配原则，这个“按劳分配”，才是社会主义社会特具的分配原则。
    我认为，在思辨中，我们应该经常注意毛主席教导的具体分析矛盾方法。到底什么和什么是一组矛盾？这组矛盾和那组矛盾是什么样的关系？这是应该首先弄清楚的，否则概念混杂，辨不出孰是孰非。以什么为分配的尺度，例如按资、按劳、按需，这是一组矛盾。在“以劳动为尺度”进行分配即“按劳分配”之下，分配所得是不是其生产的全部价值，如：“不是其生产的全部价值”即“原则与实践矛盾”，“是其生产的全部价值”即“原则与实践统一”，又是一组矛盾。很显然，这组矛盾是从属于“以劳动为尺度”的分配即“按劳分配”的。社会主义使那个在剥削阶级中存在的一般性的（在奴隶社会、封建社会也有的）“按资分配”转化为“按劳分配”了，不劳动者不得食了。但资本主义社会所特有的那个在劳动人民中“以劳动为尺度”即“按劳分配”的原则，则只是由“原则和实践矛盾”的状况转化为“原则和实践统一”的状况。这种状况，正是说明：社会主义社会是一个刚从资本主义社会脱胎出来的社会，在它身上还不可避免地存留着一些资本主义社会的痕迹；而名副其实的“按劳分配”，也有一个发展过程，并非从天而降。不说社会主义使“按劳分配”由“原则和实践矛盾”转化为“原则和实践统一”，一定要把这个“以劳动为尺度”的分配原则说成是在取消私有财产的那天才降落到人间的东西，那是符合历史观点和科学观点的么？那就是不折不扣的马克思主义么？
    还应该说明：我的那篇文章是把资产阶级剥削劳动者、占有大量社会财富这一事实当作前提带过之后，仅就社会主义的“按劳分配”和资本主义社会在劳动人民间进行分配“以劳动为尺度”的那个“按劳分配”的关系来立论的。因此，我说：“不能说‘按劳分配’是资本主义分配原则的否定……”，如果要把在资产阶级中进行分配的“按资分配”也打在内，那末这话就应改为“不能说‘按劳分配’是资本主义社会在劳动人民间进行分配的原则的否定”。但问题不是撒、乌两同志指出我原来那个提法有不够完整之处，而是撒、乌两同志在曲解了我的文义之后，根本不承认资本主义社会在劳动人民间存在“以劳动为尺度”的分配。而撒同志又有一系列的看来和科学并不相符的观点。这些观点总结一下，就是：根本不承认工资在社会分配问题的角度看来是资本主义社会在劳动人民间进行分配的形式；根本不承认在资本主义社会劳动人民参与社会分配；把资本主义社会的工资水平是以劳动力的价值为准绳和体现这个规律是以劳动为尺度付与工资根本对立起来，因而根本不承认资本家付给工资是“以劳动为尺度”即与劳动成正比例；为了和“以劳动为尺度”进行分配相对立，提出了“按劳动力分配”或他那个所谓“确切”的说法，因而否定了资产阶级通过“以劳动为尺度”付与工资的办法迫使劳动者进行高强度劳动的事实；作出“资本主义下的工资和‘按劳分配’毫不相干”的武断性的结论；由于忽视了资本主义的特殊性和否定了广大劳动人民参与社会分配，把资本主义社会的分配原则单纯地说成是“按资分配”；把刚由资本主义社会产生出来和在自身基础上发展了的共产主义的两个阶段的关系与私有制的三个社会之间的关系完全等同起来，等等。由此可见，撒同志对我那篇文章赠予的“混乱的逻辑”、“荒谬”、“乱套”、“很成问题”等“头衔”，到底应该加在谁的文章上，不能由撒同志一言为定，而是应该由客观事实去作决定的。
    以上意见，如有不妥之处，希撒、乌二同志指正。
