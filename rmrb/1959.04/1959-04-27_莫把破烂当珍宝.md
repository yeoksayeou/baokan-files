Title: Don't Treat Rubbish as Treasure

According to a United Press of India (UPI) report from Mussoorie: Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated at a press conference on the 24th that he disagreed with the Chinese side's accusation of Indian expansionist elements. He said, "I have found in reports from Beijing that they are deeply influenced by the past history of Tibet. There is no doubt that the British government acted in that way in Tibet at that time." (People's Daily, April 26)

We are very clear about what British imperialism did. What we want to say now is this: British imperialism left a pile of disgraceful legacy during its rule in India. After Britain was forced to withdraw from India, Indian patriots, people of justice, and nationalists wanted to throw this pile of disgraceful legacy into the Indian Ocean as rubbish. However, British imperialism also cultivated a group of Indian expansionist elements during its long rule in India. This group of people is willing to violate the wishes of the Indian people, insist on treating rubbish as treasure, and shamelessly say that they want to inherit the British imperialist "monopoly rights" over Tibet.

Such a group of Indian expansionist elements have ulterior motives and are sinister. They probably have not forgotten "the past history." Let us copy a fragment of history.

In the early years of the Republic of China, Britain attempted to prevent the then central government from exercising sovereignty in Tibet. Under British threat, the central government of our country at that time sent personnel to Simla, India, to hold a meeting. On January 12, 1914, the British side put forward six proposals at the meeting, including not allowing our government to exercise sovereignty in Tibet, not allowing Tibet to be changed into a province, and not allowing troops to be stationed in Tibet, etc. In addition, there were two extremely unreasonable clauses: "The Indian government shall adjudicate when there are disputes between China and Tibet" (Article 4), and "The internal affairs of Tibet shall be temporarily supervised by the Indian government" (Article 6), and so on.

The purpose of our copying these clauses is to ask some expansionist elements in India today to think deeply: You have pushed yourselves back to 1914 and are sitting side by side with the British imperialists of that time.

In the past month, Indian expansionist elements have spared no effort to plan the Tibetan rebellion. Please see: the Chinese Tibetan issue is openly discussed in the Indian Parliament, government personnel welcome and protect Tibetan rebels, diplomatic officials distribute the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," some newspapers propose holding some kind of round table conference, and those expansionist elements even organize some kind of "Support Tibet Committee." All these activities seem to be pretending to "adjudicate" and "supervise" China's internal affairs. This cannot but arouse the great anger of the Chinese people.

We can answer Prime Minister Nehru by saying: "The British government did act in that way in Tibet at that time." Are the current Indian expansionist elements not inheriting this rubbish and "acting in that way"? In the past, after Britain occupied India, it did not want to just stand still in India. It always wanted to use India as a springboard to jump onto Tibet and make Tibet a "continuation of India." Today, if expansionists are willing to sit side by side with imperialists, the result will certainly be the same as that of British imperialism, ending up being spurned by everyone.

    莫把破烂当珍宝
    梅碧华
    据印度报业托辣斯穆索里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁二十四日在记者招待会上表示不同意中国方面对于印度扩张主义分子的指责。他说：“我从来自北京的报道中发现，他们深受西藏过去的历史的影响。毫无疑问，那时的英国政府在西藏的确是那样行事的。”（四月二十六日人民日报）
    英帝国主义的所作所为，我们是十分清楚的。我们现在想说的倒是：英帝国主义在统治印度期间留下了一大堆不光彩的遗产。在英国被迫退出印度之后，印度的爱国者、正义人士和民族主义者要把这堆不光彩的遗产当作破烂丢进印度洋里去。但是，英帝国主义在长期统治印度的期间也培养了一批印度扩张主义分子。这批人就甘愿违反印度人民的愿望，硬把破烂当珍宝，大言不惭地说是要继承英帝国主义对西藏的“垄断权利”。
    这么一批印度扩张主义分子，是别具肺腑、心术不端的，大概他们也不会忘记“过去的历史”。让我们抄一点历史片断吧。
    民国初年，英国曾经企图阻止当时的中央政府在西藏行使主权。在英国的威胁下，当时我国中央政府曾经派出人员到印度的西姆拉城举行会议。1914年1月12日，英方在会上提出提案六条，其中包括不许我国政府在西藏行使主权，不许把西藏改为行省，不得在西藏驻军等等。此外，还有极端无理的两条：“中国与西藏有纷争时印度政府得判决之”（第四条），“西藏内政暂由印度政府监督”（第六条），如此等等。
    我们抄录这些条文的目的，是在于请今天的印度的一些扩张主义分子深思一番：你们已经把自己推回到1914年，并且和当时的英帝国主义并排坐在一起了。
    最近一个月来，印度扩张主义分子为了策划西藏叛乱，费尽九牛二虎之力。请看：在印度议会里公然讨论中国西藏问题，政府人员迎护西藏叛乱分子，外交官员散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，某些报纸提出召开什么圆桌会议，那些扩张主义分子甚至居然组织什么“支援西藏委员会”，所有这些活动，看来是在煞有介事地妄想对中国内政“判决”一番、“监督”一番了。这就不能不引起中国人民的极大的愤怒。
    我们可以回答尼赫鲁总理说：“那时英国的政府在西藏的确是那样行事的”，现在的印度扩张主义分子，又何尝不是继承了这份破烂，在“那样行事的”呢？从前，英国占领了印度之后，它并不想就在印度踏步不前，它总是妄想以印度为跳板，跳上西藏，使西藏成为“印度之续”；今天，如果扩张主义者甘愿和帝国主义并排坐在一起，其结果一定也会和英帝国主义一样，落得一个人人唾骂的下场。
