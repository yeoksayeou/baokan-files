Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th – On the Heilongjiang plains where ice melts and snow disappears, thousands of tractors and tens of thousands of sets of new-style animal-drawn farm tools are galloping back and forth, sowing spring wheat.

Heilongjiang Province plans to plant more than ten million mu of spring wheat this year, with tractors and new-style animal-drawn farm tools being used for more than 80% of the planting. Mechanized and semi-mechanized farm tools have replaced old farm tools, displaying enormous power and bringing obvious changes to this year's spring wheat sowing. Across the province, spring wheat is generally being sown with dense straight rows at a spacing of 7.5 centimeters, or with dense cross rows at a spacing of 15 centimeters, resulting in twice as many wheat seedlings per mu compared to wide-ridge, sparse planting. The wheat fields planted with tractors and new-style animal-drawn farm tools have fine, crumbly soil, with a tightly compressed surface but loose soil underneath. Although the spring wind is strong and evaporation is high, the soil is moist three inches below the surface.

The spring planting in Heilongjiang this year began half a month earlier than in previous years, and counties that started early have already completed their spring planting tasks.

    冰化雪消现沃壤　铁牛奔驰春播忙
    黑龙江
    新华社哈尔滨4日电　在冰化雪消的黑龙江原野上，成千台拖拉机和上万套新式畜力农具正在往来奔驰地播种春麦。
    黑龙江省今年计划种一千多万亩春小麦，使用拖拉机和新式畜力农具播种的，占80％以上。机械化和半机械化农具代替了旧农具，显出了巨大的威力，给今年春麦播种带来了明显的变化。全省春麦播种普遍达到七点五公分行距的直条密植和十五公分行距的交叉密植，每亩麦苗比宽垅稀植多一倍。用拖拉机和新式畜力农具种过的麦地，土粒细碎，表面镇压的很紧，表土下却很疏松。虽然春风急，蒸发量很大，但是三寸以下就是湿土。
    黑龙江今年春播的时间比往年提前半个月，动手早的县份春播任务已经完成。
