[Editor's Note] The Second National People's Congress is about to convene its first session. In the lead-up to the meeting, the representatives have been inspecting work and writing poems, essays, and notes, bringing our readers countless good tidings of the Great Leap Forward in our motherland. Today, we are publishing articles and poems by five comrades: Xu Guangping, Deng Chumin, Dai Yucai, Zang Kejia, and Gao Shiqi. The rest will be published successively.

　　The willows had just sprouted goose-yellow buds and tender green leaves, and the bitter cold had not yet completely retreated when I left the capital and arrived in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province, which resembles Jiangnan. In the third month of the lunar calendar, as spring deepened, tens of thousands of seedlings sprouted, peach blossoms turned red, and willows turned green. It was already a fascinating place.

　　The inspection team selected this area not only because of the favorable timing and geographical advantages but more importantly because the people of Henan achieved outstanding results on all fronts during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In the self-deprecating words of the local people, this was due to the benefits of being "poor and blank."

　　We inspected some people's communes in Henan. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we often only took a cursory look without having the chance to experience them carefully. Therefore, I feel that introducing some of my impressions to the readers is like trying to summarize the Twenty-Four Histories—I don't know where to begin. Here, I will only talk about some matters related to women.

　　In Zhengzhou, I met Old Granny Pan Shouning, who attended the National Congress of Women Activists last year. Since liberation, she has consistently been active in collective endeavors. During the Great Leap Forward last year, she said, "People say the peony is the king of flowers, but I love the factory even more." Now she leads a clothing factory (mostly women) with more than 300 people. Residents of the Wu Ying neighborhood had never learned production skills before, but after a short period of training, they used scrap iron wire to make wire mesh sieves, which are used exclusively for sifting sand during road construction and house building. Even more remarkable are the female comrades of the Water Conservancy Bureau. As a result of their hard work and ingenuity, they have now produced high-quality bacterial fertilizers and glass fertilizers. This glass fertilizer, like taking vitamins, only needs to be sprinkled on the land at a rate of four liang to half a jin per mu and can last for two to three years. Now their products are selling well everywhere. On the day we visited the site, they were smelting waste glass. The furnace foreman and her comrades were holding steel bars and wearing protective clothing, engaging in intense combat, full of heroic spirit, making people admire them immensely.

　　Due to the realization of people's communes, the vast majority of women in rural areas have participated in production. The relationships between people in the family and society are very different from before. Previously, women could not leave the stove, the kang, or the millstone, and were often in a position of holding a child in one hand and asking her husband for money in the other. Now they proudly say, "I also receive my own salary." The feudal patriarchal system that had been passed down for thousands of years from the old society has been broken. In the past, some women did not engage in production, focused only on enjoyment, and compared themselves to others in terms of food, clothing, leisure, wealth, and husbands. Now this social atmosphere has changed. They still compare themselves to others, but the content of the comparison is very different. It is now about comparing labor, progress, technology, and unity, and, in addition, comparing who loves the commune more. In a certain village in Dengfeng, an old woman did not participate in water conservancy construction due to her age, but she automatically picked up the stones on the main road to ensure that the masses engaged in water conservancy construction could walk smoothly, whether day or night. As for young women, they are even more ambitious and full of energy, not at all inferior to their male comrades. Whether in the wheat fields or by the blast furnaces, in any position in the commune, they dare to speak and act, demonstrating a heroic spirit. With such lovable people, what difficulties cannot we overcome, what things cannot we achieve?

　　The people's communes grasp production with one hand and life with the other. Because the welfare of life has been properly resolved, it has further stimulated people's enthusiasm for labor.

　　In Zhengzhou, we saw many kindergartens and nurseries, all of which were well-run. The Zhengzhou Nursery Teacher Training School also trains childcare workers for various communes. Because the children are well taken care of, the mothers work more smoothly. As the poem goes:

　　　　Xiaoping is just over two years old this year,
　　　　When she sees her mother, she throws a tantrum,
　　　　I said I had to go to work, she cried,
　　　　Her eyes were full of tears,
　　　　Since the establishment of the people's commune,
　　　　It's so much fun in the nursery,
　　　　Full of rosy complexion and energetic,
　　　　She has gained more than ten pounds,
　　　　Learning to dance and sing,
　　　　She is polite and lively,
　　　　The tears of the past are all gone,
　　　　Laughing happily,
　　　　Where does happiness come from?
　　　　The Communist Party leads with boundless grace.

　　This poem can be said to represent the feelings of millions of mothers. Nurseries not only reduce the burden of housework for women, but also directly provide good education for children. How can people not warmly welcome them?

　　The canteens in various places are generally well-run. In the Daye People's Commune, we saw a Happiness Canteen, which has not only made many improvements in cooking techniques, such as modifying the millstone to increase production fourfold, building its own water tower to reduce labor, and manufacturing advanced cooking utensils such as multi-stove pots and drawer steamers, but they have also set up reception halls, mother-child halls, and elderly halls to receive guests based on different needs. The reception hall is specifically used to entertain guests of the commune members' families. The elderly hall and mother-child hall are set up because the elderly and children eat food that is different in terms of softness and hardness from ordinary people, and the pace of eating is different, so it is not good to mix them together. On the lintel above each dining hall, there are four lines of poetry, expressing the cook's expectations and love for his guests. In the poem above the lintel of the elderly hall, there are two sentences saying that they also take care of boiling medicine for patients. This meticulous care for people deeply moved every representative who visited that day. The Party Secretary of the commune said: The Chinese people have always had the fine tradition of respecting the old and loving the young. Now that our people's communes have been established, we should think more thoroughly!

　　What moved me particularly was the Kangfu Paradise of the Daye People's Commune. This organization combines the obstetrics and gynecology hospital with the nurseries and kindergartens. Women rest in the Kangfu Paradise for a total of forty-five days, half a month before childbirth and one month after childbirth. Both mothers and children receive extremely good care. This is a remote mountain town, but they have managed to provide showers for pregnant women, have doctors care for them during childbirth, and distinguish between accommodation for the first week after childbirth and after the first week. If a mother enters the hospital with a child who is just one or two years old, someone else will take care of the child. In the past, many women needed someone to take care of them during childbirth, but there was a lack of personnel, so she had to take care of many household chores herself, which damaged her health. Now, the people's communes have completely solved this problem. No wonder, when I talked to the women about these issues, each of them gratefully said: The people's commune is really good, it has thoroughly thought about everything for us!

　　中州记行
　　全国妇女联合会副主席　许广平
　　〔编者的话〕第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议就要举行了。会议前夕，代表们在视察工作的时候，写下了许多诗文、随笔和手记，他们给我们的读者带来了祖国大跃进的无数喜讯。今天我们先发表许广平、邓初民、戴玉才、臧克家、高士其等五位同志的文章和诗，其余的将陆续发表。
    杨柳刚吐出鹅黄嫩绿，严寒尚未退尽的时候，我离开首都，来到了有似江南一般的河南省会郑州。暮春三月，万苗齐发，桃红柳绿，这里已然是一片令人无限神往的境地了。
    视察组选中这个地区，不仅因为天时地利。更重要的是因为河南人民在1958年的全民大跃进中在各个战线上都有出色的成绩，用当地人民自我谦虚的话来解释，这就是由于“一穷二白”所给的好处。
    我们在河南视察了一些人民公社。可惜由于时间紧迫，我们往往都是走马观花，没有来得及仔细地体味，所以感到要向读者介绍一些看过以后的印象，又觉得好似一部二十四史，不知从何说起。在这里，我只向大家说一些妇女方面的事情。
    我在郑州见到了去年出席全国妇女积极分子大会的潘寿宁老大娘。她在解放以后，一贯积极于集体事业，去年大跃进高潮中，她曾经这样说过：“人说牡丹是花王，我爱牡丹更爱厂”，现在她领导着一个拥有三百多人的被服厂（大部分是妇女）。武英里的街道居民，过去从未学习过生产劳动，但是经过短时期的学习，她们就把废铁丝拿来改制成铁丝网箩，专供修路和建筑房屋时筛砂之用。更不简单的是水利厅的妇女同志，由于她们苦干巧干的结果，现在已经做出了质量很高的细菌肥料和玻璃肥料，这种玻璃肥料，如同人们服用维生素一般，每亩地只要撒上四两到半斤，可以支持两年到三年之久，现在她们的这种产品，已经畅销各地了。我们到现场参观的那天，她们正在冶炼废旧玻璃，炉长和她的几个战友，都手执钢条，身穿劳动保护服装进行紧张的战斗，英姿勃勃，使人敬佩不已。
    由于实现了人民公社化，农村中绝大多数妇女，都参加了生产。在家庭和社会中，人与人的关系和以前大有不同了。以前妇女离不开锅台、炕台、磨台，经常处在一种一手抱孩子一手向丈夫要钱的地位，现在她们自豪地说：“我也领到自己的工资了。”旧社会遗留下来的几千年相沿已久的封建家长制度，从此被打破了。过去有些妇女，不事生产，专讲享受，和别人比吃穿，比清闲，比钱多，比爱人，现在这种社会风气已经改变了，她们和别人不是不比，而是比的内容大有不同了，这就是比劳动，比进步，比技术，比团结，此外，还要加一条，比谁爱社了。登封某村有一位老太太，因为年纪大，没有去参加兴修水利的工作，但是她自动把大路上的石头拾得干干净净，为的是无论白天或黑夜，让那些兴修水利的群众，走得平平稳稳。至于青年妇女，那更是壮志凌云，干劲十足，一点不比男同志差多少。无论在麦田里还是在高炉边，无论在公社的任何一个岗位上，她们真是敢说敢做，表现出一股英雄气概。有了这样可爱的人民，我们有什么困难不能克服，有什么事情不能做到呢？
    人民公社一只手抓生产，一只手又抓生活。由于生活福利得到了妥善的解决，因而更激发了人们的劳动积极性。
    在郑州，我们看了很多幼儿院和托儿所，都办得很好，郑州幼师还为各个公社培养保教人员。由于孩子得到了妥善的安置，妈妈工作起来就格外顺心。有诗为证：
      小平今年两岁多，
      见了妈妈就撒泼，
      我说上班她哭闹，
      两眼汪汪泪水多，
      人民公社成立起，
      托儿所里真快乐，
      满面红光精神爽，
      体重增了十斤多，
      学跳舞，学唱歌，
      又懂礼貌又活泼，
      往日眼泪全不见，
      欢天喜地笑哈哈，
      试问幸福哪里来，
      共产党领导恩情多。
    这一首诗，可以说代表了千千万万妈妈的心情。托儿所不但减轻了妇女的家务劳累，而且直接对小孩进行了良好教育。这样，人们焉能不热烈的欢迎它呢？
    各地的食堂，一般都办的很好，在大冶人民公社，我们看到一个幸福食堂，它不但在做饭技术方面，作了很多改进，如改装磨台，增加生产四倍，自造水塔，减轻劳力，一灶几锅，抽屉蒸笼等先进炊具的制造，在食堂他们还另设了招待厅、母子厅、老年厅等，分别不同对象接待客人。招待厅专门用来招待社员家里的客人，老年厅和母子厅都是因为老年人和小孩子同一般人吃的饭软硬不一，且快慢不等，因此不好混在一起。在每个饭厅的门楣上面，都贴有四句诗歌，表明炊事员对他的客人的期待和热爱，在老人厅门楣上面的诗歌中，有两句话说他们还兼管替病人煎药。对于人的这种无微不至的关怀，那天在场参观的每个代表，莫不深切感动。公社的党委书记说：中国人民历来都有敬老爱幼的优良传统，现在我们人民公社化了，应当设想的更周到些才是！
    使我特别感动的，还有大冶人民公社的康福乐园。这一个组织，把妇产院和托儿所、幼儿园连在了一起。妇女产前半月，产后一月，一共四十五天都在康福乐园休息，母亲和孩子都得到了极其良好的照顾，这里是一个偏背的山镇，但是他们却能设法让产妇淋浴，分娩时有医生照顾，产后一星期内的住处和一星期后都有区别，如果妈妈进院时还带着一个刚生一、两岁的孩子，那就另外有人照顾。过去许多妇女在生产期间需要有人照顾但又缺人，以致使她不得不亲自料理许多家务，因而损害了她的健康。现在，人民公社却把这个问题彻底解决了。难怪，当我一和妇女们谈到这些问题时，她们每一个人都感激的说：人民公社实在好，它替我们把什么问题都想透了！
