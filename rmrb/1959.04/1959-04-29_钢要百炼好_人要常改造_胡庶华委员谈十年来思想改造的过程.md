Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report on the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    The Chinese people will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with unparalleled excitement and joy on October 1st this year. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have accomplished many great undertakings that no predecessors had done or could have done, and our motherland has embarked on unprecedented happiness and prosperity. We are living a life where "one day equals twenty years," and everything is leaping forward.

    Premier Zhou's report is rich in content and broad in scope, a concrete manifestation of the full development of living Marxism-Leninism in China, and provides us with many instructions and inspirations. Now, allow me to talk about my ten-year process of self-reform and my experiences.

    Premier Zhou said in his report: "Building a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals is a great historical task on the cultural and educational front. This contingent will be produced by relying on the training of new intellectuals and the remolding of old intellectuals." Analyzing these few sentences, we can derive three important meanings: First, the issue of remolding old intellectuals has never been interrupted in the past ten years, but today the standards for remolding are different, the standard being working-class intellectuals. Second, the usefulness of old intellectuals lies in their knowledge, which must serve the politics of the working class and cannot be privately owned. Third, it is necessary and possible for them to be transformed into working-class intellectuals, otherwise it will affect the development of productive forces and the consolidation of relations of production, which is detrimental to our socialist construction.

    I am an old intellectual in my seventies. Thanks to the Party's consistent special care for old intellectuals and its continuous efforts to unite, educate, and remold us, it should be affirmed that the vast majority of old intellectuals have been moved and have carried out self-reform. However, there are differences in age, physique, methods, and requirements, and therefore the progress of reform varies. As for myself, I am old, my methods are clumsy, and my physique is not very good, but my desire is very urgent, so I can only rely on the Party's education and continuous learning. The past ten years can be divided into three learning stages, which are also three stages of reform. The first stage was from October 1949 to August 1952, the second stage was from September 1952 to September 1956, and the third stage was from October 1956 to the present.

    Three Stages

    I arrived in Beijing on October 17, 1949, a day that marked my transition from darkness to light. At that time, the vibrant atmosphere of Beijing was worlds apart from the Beijing I remembered when I studied at the Translation School. Soon after, the metallurgical specialty program affiliated with the Beijing Advanced Industrial Vocational School was short of teachers, and I gladly volunteered to go, with the aim of reforming my bourgeois educational ideology. I joined the trade union and participated in trade union group learning. In August 1950, this metallurgical specialty program was merged into the Department of Metallurgy of North China University (now Beijing Institute of Technology). I also transferred to the Department of Metallurgy to teach. When the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, I served as the leader of the metallurgical department's trade union study group, gaining more opportunities to learn. During the Three-Anti and Loyalty-Honest movements, I thoroughly cleansed myself of the filth I had brought from the old society. Colleagues and students organized a group to help me, especially four Communist Youth League members who came to my home one evening to talk to me, and as a result, I was completely persuaded to abandon my mistaken belief that I had no accomplices in the old society. I negated everything in the past. This profound education is something I will never forget. This was the first stage of my self-reform. In this stage, I realized: 1. Without great destruction, there can be no great construction. 2. Old bottles cannot be filled with new wine unless the old wine is poured out. 3. The Party will not wrong a good person and looks at cadres from a developmental perspective. 4. Accept criticism without fear of pain or shame. 5. Get rid of arrogance, affectation, and saving face. 6. Thought reform requires long-term planning. I resolved to spend ten years as a preliminary time for self-reform.

    In September 1952, I arrived at the newly established Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, which was formed by merging the metallurgy departments of five universities and colleges. Its own campus had not yet been built, so it temporarily borrowed part of the buildings of Tsinghua University as a temporary campus. I met more old friends. Because my sense of inferiority was particularly strong, I felt particularly ashamed when I saw old friends, especially progressive friends or students. In fact, this approach lost the help of progressive friends and was wrong. Tsinghua ran a crash course in Russian, and I shaved off my long beard, which I had kept for more than twenty years, before going to study. These remnants of bourgeois face-saving and fear of shame still existed. In the spring of 1953, a steel plant in Yangshupu, Shanghai, was privately owned by capitalists, and its business was very good. It wanted to expand production and needed to hire a chief engineer, with a monthly salary of eight thousand catties of millet. Someone asked for my consent, and I declined, which was a test for me. If I had gone, I would have fallen into the quagmire of the bourgeoisie and it would have been even more difficult to reform. In December 1954, I was nominated as a member of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, which was an honorable political task given to me by the Party. However, my social activities increased. I used to have to go to the city frequently to attend various meetings and study sessions of the headquarters and the municipal committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, and I already felt that a lot of time was lost in transportation. In addition, occupational diseases and purely technical viewpoints played a role. Although I served as the director of the library of the Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, I started from personal interests and did not want to miss the opportunity to read books, and I did not fulfill my responsibilities for administrative work. There was also a bourgeois intellectual thought, which was the thought of "one book doctrine" and "making a great splash," always wanting to write a book or invent the fastest steelmaking method, that is, the one-step steelmaking method. These muddled thoughts made me feel tired of many studies. There was also an not completely correct thought, which was to emphasize the need to systematically study theory. These thoughts were reflected in my speeches and proposals at the Second Plenary Session of the Second CPPCC National Committee in February 1956 and the Third Plenary Session of the CPPCC National Committee in March 1957. This was the second stage of self-reform. Although some incorrect or not completely correct thoughts occurred in this stage, thanks to the frequent education and help from the Party Committee of the Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, my incorrect thoughts were clarified, and my enthusiasm was also encouraged. In addition, the colleagues in the library (including Party and Youth League members), especially Deputy Curator Chen Fang (a Party member), gave me a lot of help. I never felt that the rightists' slander of "having a position without power" was true. In this stage, my mood was comfortable, but complacency grew, and I thought that the reform was almost complete. If I had not studied at the Academy of Socialism, there was a great possibility that I would have declined.

    On October 15, 1956, the Academy of Socialism opened. The original study period was one year, specializing in three courses: Marxist-Leninist Philosophy—Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, Political Economics, and the History of the Chinese Revolution. In addition, there were special reports, visits, and group discussions. Until the end of April 1957, this period of study was relaxed and pleasant, and great progress was made. In May, the Great Blooming and Contending began. Unexpectedly, the rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, and I suddenly felt nervous. The regular classes were suspended. After June 8, the anti-rightist struggle began, which was a lesson I had never properly learned. In the Five Great Movements and Three Great Transformations, I had never struggled against others, nor had I been struggled against myself. Moreover, I brought some decadent ideas from the thread-bound books of the old society, such as the "Doctrine of the Mean," "Do not go too far," and "Stop at the right time," which made me regard such a fierce class struggle, a struggle between two roads and a life-and-death struggle, as a matter of thought, rather than a matter of political stand. Only after reading the People's Daily editorial did I realize the seriousness of this issue, and I also participated in many criticism meetings, but the fighting spirit was not strong enough. It was not until I bared my soul to the Party in March 1958 that I formulated a personal self-reform plan after group discussions and assistance, which ended in late July. In this stage, I discovered that I still had duplicity and sentimentalism, especially that the bourgeois individualistic ideas of fame and position were my big watermelon. At the end of September, I began to study socialist education, and after visiting the people's communes in Xushui and Anguo, I also studied the Party's resolution on several issues concerning the people's communes and other current affairs policies. I participated in productive labor at the Wanfeng Station and Wanshou Station of the Sijiqing People's Commune in the suburbs. I revised the self-reform plan. These are all huge gains brought to us by the nationwide rectification movement. It is also the stage of my personal transformation and remolding.

    Eight Experiences

    In this stage, I have the following eight experiences: 1. Studying theory must be combined with practice. If you only study Marxism-Leninism in books and do not combine it with your own ideological practice and work practice, it is easy to make mistakes. 2. As long as you study dialectical materialism deeply and thoroughly, you can learn historical materialism by yourself. 3. After learning the experience of class struggle, your sense of smell will be more sensitive, and your vigilance will also be improved. 4. Physical labor can indeed accelerate our self-reform. 5. As long as you sincerely accept the Party's leadership, any difficulty can be overcome. 6. Self-reform must first reform your political stand, and then carry out ideological reform on this basis. 7. Ideological reform requires ideological struggle. Correct ideas must often struggle with incorrect ideas. 8. When you are humble, correct ideas will inevitably triumph. When you are arrogant, incorrect ideas will prevail. Chairman Mao taught us that "modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind," which is our constant warning.

    In general, my political thought and position reform in the past ten years has been a wave-like progress, rather than a spiral-like ascent. Now I realize that self-reform is truly a long-term, arduous, and repetitive process. However, we must make "long-term" leap forward, let "arduous" bow its head, and shatter "repetition." As long as we have the indomitable determination and the courage to move mountains and create seas, we will inevitably be able to move Mount Tai, accept the Party's leadership unswervingly, and never change the socialist path even if the seas dry up and the rocks crumble. For me, if I cannot achieve this kind of reform, it is meaningless even if I live to be one hundred and twenty years old. I must be transformed into a working-class intellectual, otherwise I will never give up. Now I have turned the language of the ancient working people into a poem: Distance tests the strength of a horse, strong winds reveal the sturdiness of grass, true gold fears no fire, and steel needs a hundred refinements. It reflects my experience in the whole process.

    A Message to Indian Friends

    Finally, I would like to send this poem to the friends of India, a country with whom we have had friendly relations for more than two thousand years, for reference. We old Chinese intellectuals deeply realize that the Chinese Communist Party is the core force leading the Chinese people's revolution and construction. We consciously and voluntarily carry out thorough reform, and then we can, together with the working people of the whole country, accept the Party's leadership wholeheartedly and embark on the bright road of socialism. Today, the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people is a flesh-and-blood relationship like that of parents and children. This is not easy for you to understand. However, it is easy for you to understand that the Chinese people are willing to make "confidants" and friends who can "share weal and woe." Recently, a group of expansionists in India, attempting to inherit the illegal and unjust privileges that British imperialism had obtained by force in Tibet in the past under the guise of the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" and "Tibetan independence," is tantamount to enjoying the fruits in the hands of past robbers, which is very unfriendly. If you insist on doing so, you will inevitably be bruised and battered by the copper wall and iron wall of the Chinese people closely united around the Chinese Communist Party, and you will suffer a shameful defeat.

    钢要百炼好　人要常改造
    胡庶华委员谈十年来思想改造的过程主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李维汉副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    中国人民将在今年十月一日以无比兴奋和无限欢乐的心情庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的国庆。十年来中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，做了不少前人未曾做而且也不可能做的伟大事业，我们祖国走上了史无前例的康乐与繁荣。我们正在过着“一天等于二十年”的生活，一切都在大跃进。
    周总理报告的内容丰富，范围广大，是活生生的马克思列宁主义在中国充分发展的具体表现，给我们的指示和启发是很多的。现在只请让我谈一谈十年来自我改造的过程和体会。
    周总理在报告中说：“建立一支成千万人的工人阶级知识分子队伍，是文教战线的一项伟大的历史任务。这支队伍要依靠培养新知识分子和改造旧知识分子而产生。”从这几句话里加以分析，就得到三点重要意义：一、旧知识分子改造问题，十年来未尝间断，而今天要求改造的标准不同了，标准是工人阶级知识分子。二、旧知识分子之所以有用，就在于他们有知识，这些知识必须为工人阶级的政治服务而不能私有。三、他们有必要而且可能改造成工人阶级知识分子，否则就会影响生产力的发展和生产关系的巩固，对我们的社会主义建设事业是不利的。
    我是一个七十多岁的旧知识分子，由于党一贯地对旧知识分子特别关怀，不断地对我们进行团结、教育和改造，应当肯定地说，绝大多数旧知识分子都受到感动，进行了自我改造。不过年龄、体格、方法和要求有差别，因而改造的进度有所不同。就我个人来说，年龄大，方法笨，体格也不算太好，而要求则十分迫切，只有依靠党的教育和不断的学习。十年来可分为三个学习阶段，也就是三个改造阶段。从一九四九年十月到一九五二年八月为第一阶段，从一九五二年九月到一九五六年九月为第二阶段，从一九五六年十月到现在为第三阶段。
    三个阶段
    一九四九年十月十七日我到了北京，这是从黑暗走向光明的一天。当时我看到北京的蓬勃气象与过去我在北京译学馆读书时的北京相比，真有天壤之别。不久，北京高级工业职业学校附设的冶金专修科尚缺少教员，我欣然愿去，目的在于改造我的资产阶级教育思想。我进了工会，参加了工会小组学习。一九五○年八月这个冶金专修科并入了华北大学（即现在的北京工业学院）冶金系。我亦转到冶金系教课。抗美援朝运动开始，我担任了冶金系工会学习小组长，获得了更多学习的机会。在三反运动和忠诚老实运动中，我把从旧社会带来的一身肮脏，彻底干净地洗了澡。同事和同学组织了一个小组，对我进行帮助，特别是有四位团员同学在一个晚上到我家里谈话，结果，对我自以为在旧社会没有帮凶的错误看法完全说服了。我否定了过去的一切。这一场深刻的教育是我终身不能忘的。这是我自我改造的第一阶段。在这个阶段里，我认识到：1．没有大破，不能大立。2．旧瓶装新酒，旧酒不倒去，新酒不进来。3．党不会冤枉一个好人，而且是从发展来看干部的。4．接受批评，不要怕痛怕丑。 5．打掉骄气、臭架子和面子。6．思想改造要有长期打算。我下了决心，要花十年工夫，作为初步自我改造的时间。
    一九五二年九月我到了新成立的北京钢铁学院，这个学院是由五个大学和学院的冶金系合并组成的。自己的校舍尚未建成，暂借用清华大学的一部分房屋作为临时校舍。我遇到的老朋友更多了。由于我的自卑感特别浓厚，见到老朋友，特别是进步的朋友或学生，大有自惭形秽之感。其实，这种做法，失掉了进步朋友的帮助，是错误的。清华办了俄文突击班，我把留了二十多年的长胡子剃掉了，才去学习。这些资产阶级好面子、怕丑的思想残余仍然存在。一九五三年春间，上海杨树浦有一个炼钢厂是资本家私人经营的，营业很好，想扩大生产，要请一位总工程师，月薪小米八千斤。有人征求我的同意，我谢绝了，这对我是一个考验。如果去了，就掉到资产阶级的泥坑，更不容易改造。一九五四年十二月我被提名为政协第二届全国委员会委员，这是党给我一个光荣的政治任务。可是我的社会活动增加了，原来要时常进城参加民革总部和市委会的各种会议和学习会，已经感觉在交通上损失的时间很多，加上职业病和纯技术观点作怪，虽然担任了钢铁学院图书馆馆长，而我从个人利益出发，不想放过看书的机会，而对行政工作没有尽到责任。还有一种资产阶级知识分子的思想，就是“一本书主义”和“一鸣惊人”的思想，总想写一本书或者发明一个最快的炼钢方法即一步炼钢法。这些糊涂思想，使得我对许多的学习，感到厌倦。还有一种不完全正确的思想，就是强调要有系统地学习理论。这些思想，有一部分在一九五六年二月政协二届全委会二次全体会议和一九五七年三月政协全委会三次全体会议上的发言和提案中都反映出来了。这是自我改造的第二阶段。在这一阶段里虽然发生一些不正确或者不完全正确的思想，由于钢铁学院的党委的经常对我教育和帮助，澄清了我的不正确的思想，也鼓励了我的积极性。还有图书馆的工作同志（包括党、团员），特别是副馆长陈放（党员）同志，都给了我不少的帮助。右派分子“有职无权”的谰言，我从来没有这样的感觉。在这一阶段里，心情是舒畅的，但是，滋长了自满情绪，自己以为改造差不多了。如果不到社会学院学习，大有走下坡路的可能。
    一九五六年十月十五日社会主义学院开学了。原定学习期限一年，专修马克思列宁主义哲学——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义、政治经济学和中国革命史三种课程，此外还有专题报告、参观和小组讨论等等。一直到一九五七年四月底以前，这一段的学习是轻松愉快，而且进步很大。五月开始大鸣大放，不料右派分子向党猖狂进攻，顿觉紧张，正课停了，六月八号以后，开始了反右派斗争，这正是我从来没有好好学习的一课。在五大运动三大改造中，我没有斗争过别人，自己也没有受到斗争。又从旧社会的线装书里带来什么“中庸之道”、“不为已甚”、“适可而止”等等腐朽思想，使我对这样激烈的阶级斗争，两条道路和你死我活的斗争，看成为思想问题，而不是政治立场问题。读了人民日报的社论以后，才认识到这个问题的严重性，也参加了很多的批判会，而斗争性不够强。一直到一九五八年三月向党交心，经过小组的讨论和帮助，制定了个人自我改造规划，至七月底才告结束。在这个阶段里，发现了我还有两面性和温情主义存在，特别是，资产阶级个人主义的名位思想是我的大西瓜。九月底开始社会主义教育的学习，参观了徐水、安国的人民公社以后，又学习了党的关于人民公社若干问题的决议和其他时事政策。参加了郊区四季青人民公社万丰站和万寿站的生产劳动。修订了自我改造规划。这都是全民整风运动给我们带来的巨大收获。也是我个人脱胎换骨的改造阶段。
    八点体会
    在这一阶段里，有下列八点的体会：1．学习理论必须联系实际，如果仅仅学习了书本上的马克思列宁主义，而没有结合自己的思想实际和工作实践是容易犯错误的。2．只要把辩证唯物主义学习得深和透，就可以自学历史唯物主义。3．学习了阶级斗争的经验以后，嗅觉就比较灵敏，警惕性也提高了。4．体力劳动确实可以加速我们的自我改造。5．只要真诚地接受党的领导，什么困难都可以克服。6．自我改造，首先要改造政治立场，在这个基础上再进行思想改造。7．思想改造要进行思想斗争，正确的思想必须经常同不正确的思想作斗争。8．虚心的时候，正确的思想必然取得胜利，骄傲的时候，不正确的思想就会占了上风。毛主席教导我们说“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。是我们时时刻刻的警钟。
    总的来说，十年来我的政治思想和立场的改造是波浪式的前进，而不是螺旋式的上升。现在我认识到自我改造真正是长期的、艰巨的反复的过程。但是，我们必须叫“长期”跃进，让“艰巨”低头，把“反复”粉碎。只要我们有百折不挠的决心，移山造海的勇气，就必然做到泰山可移，接受党的领导不能动摇，海枯石烂，走社会主义的道路不能改变，对我来说，如果不能做到这样改造，纵然活到一百二十岁也没有意义。我必须改造成为一个工人阶级知识分子，否则决不罢休。我现在把古代劳动人民的语言做成一首诗：路遥知马力，疾风知劲草，真金不怕火，钢要百炼好。反映我在整个过程中的体会。
    奉告印度朋友
    最后，我想把这首诗也送给我们有两千多年友好关系的国家——印度的朋友们参考。我们中国旧知识分子深深地认识到中国共产党是领导中国人民革命和建设的核心力量，自觉自愿地进行彻底改造，然后能同全国劳动人民一道心悦诚服地接受党的领导，走社会主义的光明大道。今天中国共产党同中国人民的关系是父母儿女似的血肉相连的关系。这是你们所不容易了解的。但是，中国人民愿意交“知己”的和能“共患难”的朋友是你们容易了解的。最近印度有一批扩张主义分子，企图在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”和“西藏独立”的幌子下，阴谋继承英帝国主义过去在西藏用暴力得来的非法和违反正义的特权，这就等于要享受过去强盗手中的果实，这是很不够朋友的。如果你们一定要这样做，就必然会被中国人民紧密团结在中国共产党周围的铜墙铁壁碰得头破血流，而遭到可耻的失败。
