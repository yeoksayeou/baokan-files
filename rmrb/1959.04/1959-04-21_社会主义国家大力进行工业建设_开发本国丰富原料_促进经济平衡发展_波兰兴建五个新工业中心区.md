Socialist Countries Vigorously Carry Out Industrial Construction
    Developing Abundant Domestic Resources, Promoting Balanced Economic Development
    Poland Builds Five New Industrial Centers

(Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw) Poland is building five new industrial center zones. These new industrial zones will all be based on the utilization and development of domestic resources and will be built in the areas where the resources are produced.

One huge industrial center, which is under intense construction, is located in the Konin-Kujawy region, which is rich in lignite and salt mines. The main construction projects are concentrated in Konin, including three lignite mines and three large power stations. In seven years, it will be able to produce 10 million tons of lignite annually. This area will also be a base for the production of chemical products in the future. Kujawy has abundant salt mines, and in seven years, its annual salt production will increase to 3 million tons.

Another new industrial zone under construction is Tarnobrzeg in Rzeszów Province. Four years ago, large amounts of sulfur deposits were discovered here, and the proven reserves now rank first in Europe. Sulfur mining began here in 1958, and a second mine will be built in 1961. By 1965, the annual sulfur production will reach 2.2 million tons.

The third industrial zone under construction is the Głogów-Legnica area in Wrocław Province. Recently, huge copper deposits were discovered in this area. Preparations are now underway to build copper mines, copper foundries, and ore dressing plants. In 1965, the copper production in this area will reach more than 2 million tons.

The other two industrial zones under construction are the Turów area and the area where Rzeszów Province and Kraków Province intersect. In the Turów area, Europe's largest thermal power station and a large number of lignite mines are currently under construction. In the area where Rzeszów and Kraków intersect, the main project is the comprehensive utilization of the already discovered natural gas. In the next seven years, Poland will build nearly two hundred industrial enterprises. Many of these enterprises are expected to be built in the above-mentioned new industrial zones. The establishment of these new industrial zones will promote the balanced economic development of various provinces and regions, and make many regions in the country prosperous. (Attached picture)

Poland is formulating a long-term plan for the development of the metallurgical industry. It is estimated that Poland will produce 12.5 million tons of steel annually in 1975. This is the steel rail manufactured by the Kościuszko Iron and Steel Works in Chorzów, Poland.

    社会主义国家大力进行工业建设
    开发本国丰富原料　促进经济平衡发展
    波兰兴建五个新工业中心区
    据新华社华沙讯　波兰正在兴建五个新的工业中心区。这些新工业区都将以利用和开发本国的原料为基础，在原料产地兴建起来。
    一个正在紧张地进行建设的巨大工业中心，位于盛产褐煤和盐矿的科宁—库雅维地区。主要的建设项目集中在科宁，其中包括三个褐煤矿井和三座大型电力站。七年后，这里每年将可以生产一千万吨褐煤。这一地区将来还是化学产品的生产基地。库雅维拥有丰富的盐矿，七年后，它的盐的年产量将增加到三百万吨。
    正在建设的另一个新工业区是热舒夫省的塔诺布惹克。四年前，这里发现了大量的硫磺矿，现在查明的储量已经占欧洲第一位。1958年这里已开始开采硫磺，1961年将要建设第二座矿井，到1965年，硫磺年产量将可以达到二百二十万吨。
    第三个正在建设的工业区是弗罗茨瓦夫省的格沃古夫—累格尼察地区。不久前，在这一带发现了巨大的铜矿。现在这里正准备建设铜矿、铸铜厂和选矿厂。1965年，这一地区铜的产量可达到二百万吨以上。
    正在建设的另外两个工业区是图鲁夫地区、热舒夫省和克拉科夫省交界的地区。在图鲁夫地区目前正在建设欧洲最大的火力发电站和大批的褐煤矿井。在热舒夫和克拉科夫交界的地区，主要是建设综合利用现在已经发现的天然瓦斯的工程。在今后七年内，波兰将兴建将近二百个工业企业。其中许多企业预计要建设在上述新工业区。这些新工业区的建立将促进各省、各地区的经济的平衡发展，使国内许多地区都繁荣起来。（附图片）
