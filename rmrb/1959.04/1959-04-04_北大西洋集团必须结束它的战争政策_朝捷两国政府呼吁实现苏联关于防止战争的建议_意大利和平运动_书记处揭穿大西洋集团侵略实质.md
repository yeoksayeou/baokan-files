Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 3rd: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement fully supporting and endorsing the peace proposals put forward by the Soviet government in its statement of March 29 regarding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

	The statement said, "The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the implementation of this proposal by the Soviet government not only conforms to the interests of world peace, but also fully conforms to the national interests of the Korean people." "The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly maintains that the participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should accept this proposal by the Soviet government and immediately end their pursuit of a policy of war."

	The statement said, "The only way to ensure world peace and human security is not to organize military blocs, but to adhere to the principles of peaceful coexistence among all countries and to strengthen and develop mutual cooperation."

	The statement said, "All the actual activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the past decade have clearly shown that this institution is an aggressive institution that promotes the arms race and the 'Cold War,' and provokes new wars." "The fact that Western imperialists are actively using this institution to oppose the increasingly widespread national liberation movements today also exposes the aggressive nature of this institution."

	The statement said, "The Korean people clearly remember that most member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, headed by US imperialism, participated in the shameful war of aggression against the Korean people, bringing immeasurable pain and hardship to the Korean people." The statement said, "The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea opposes the stationing of foreign imperialist aggressor troops in any country in Asia; opposes turning any country or any region in Asia into an atomic base for the US aggressor forces; and once again clarifies its position in favor of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone throughout Asia."

Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: Today, the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, on behalf of the government, issued a statement saying that the ten years since the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have fully proven that the purpose of this military bloc's activities since its establishment has been to fuel the "Cold War," create animosity between countries, intensify the arms race, and prepare to launch a war against socialist countries.

	The statement pointed out that the United States' practice of establishing military bases on the territory of other countries and deploying atomic weapons and rocket weapons on these bases is irrefutable proof of the aggressive policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

	The statement specifically mentioned the danger of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's policy on the German question and emphasized that, due to the Federal Republic of Germany's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the support of the United States, German militarism has rapidly revived, and West Germany has become the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's strike force in Europe, second only to the United States, which is also a danger to other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

	The statement pointed out that the spearhead of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's policy is not only directed at socialist countries but also at the national liberation movements in Asia and Africa.

	The statement concluded that the Czechoslovak government believes that the conclusion of a mutual non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact is of great significance. Such a treaty can powerfully deter the activities of any aggressor.

Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd: According to TASS, Rome, April 2nd: On the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Secretariat of the "Italian Peace Movement" issued a statement exposing the aggressive nature of the organization.

	The statement emphasized that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization claims to be committed to peace, but the governments of the member states of this group oppose all concrete measures for disarmament and relaxation of tension.

	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization proclaims itself as a bastion of the freedom of all peoples, but everyone knows that it is with the help of the weapons of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that the freedom of the Algerian people has been suppressed, the independence of many countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas has been eliminated or restricted, and the complete unification of the Chinese people has been obstructed.

	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization proclaims itself as a defensive organization, but at the same time, it is expanding the network of the most powerful offensive weapons—atomic missile bases.

	The statement said that the Italian people, with unease and indignation, point out that the Italian government's response to various demands for easing world tension is: attempting to establish an Italo-Franco-German triangular alliance within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, hindering any progress conducive to peace, refusing to resolve the Berlin issue, attempting to perpetuate the Cold War, and allowing West German revanchism to develop arbitrarily.

	The Secretariat of the "Italian Peace Movement" called on the Italian people to resolutely oppose the Cold War policy and the arms race policy, and to especially oppose the establishment of US missile bases on Italian territory.

    北大西洋集团必须结束它的战争政策
    朝捷两国政府呼吁实现苏联关于防止战争的建议
    “意大利和平运动”书记处揭穿大西洋集团侵略实质
    新华社平壤3日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天发表声明，表示完全支持和赞同苏联政府在3月29日发表的关于北大西洋公约组织的声明中所提出的和平建议。
    声明说：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，实现苏联政府的这一建议不但符合世界和平的利益，而且也完全符合朝鲜人民的民族利益。”“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚决主张，北大西洋公约参加国应接受苏联政府的这一建议，立即结束他们追求的战争政策。”
    声明说：“保证世界和平和人类安全的唯一出路不是组织军事集团，而是遵守一切国家间和平共存的原则，加强和发展互相合作。”
    声明说：“过去十年来北大西洋公约集团的一切实际活动明白地显示了这一机构是鼓吹军备竞赛和‘冷战’、挑拨新战争的侵略机构。”“西方帝国主义者积极利用这一机构来反对今天日益广泛发展的民族解放运动的事实，也暴露了这一机构的侵略本质。”
    声明说：“朝鲜人民清清楚楚地记得以美帝国主义为首的北大西洋公约集团的大部分成员国参加了反对朝鲜人民的可耻的侵略战争，给朝鲜人民带来了不可估量的痛苦和艰难。”声明说：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府反对外来帝国主义侵略军队驻扎在亚洲的任何一个国家；反对把亚洲的任何一个国家或任何一个地区变成美国侵略军的原子基地；同时再一次阐明它主张在亚洲整个地区建立无原子武器区的立场。”
    新华社2日讯　今天捷克斯洛伐克外交部代表政府发表声明说，北大西洋公约组织建立以来的十年充分证明，这个军事集团自其建立之日起，它活动的目的就是要助长
  “冷战”、制造各国之间的敌意、加剧国际紧张局势、加紧扩充军备的运动和准备向社会主义国家发动战争。
    声明指出，美国在别国领土上建立军事基地并在这些基地上设置原子武器和火箭武器的做法，就是北大西洋公约组织侵略政策无可争辩的证明。
    声明特别提到北大西洋公约组织对德国问题的政策的危险性，并强调指出，由于德意志联邦共和国加入了北大西洋公约组织，由于美国的支持，德国军国主义已迅速复活，西德成了北大西洋公约组织在欧洲的仅次于美国的一支突击部队，这对北大西洋公约组织其他成员国也是一种危险。
    声明指出，北大西洋公约组织政策的矛头不仅指向社会主义国家，而且还指向亚非国家的民族解放运动。
    声明最后说，捷克斯洛伐克政府认为北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约之间缔结互不侵犯条约具有重大的意义。这种条约能有力地阻止任何侵略者的活动。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社罗马2日讯：在北大西洋公约组织成立十周年的时候，“意大利和平运动”书记处发表了一项声明，声明揭露了这个组织的侵略性质。
    声明着重指出，北大西洋公约组织声称它愿意致力于和平，但是，这个集团成员国的政府却反对裁减军备和缓和紧张局势方面的一切具体措施。
    北大西洋公约组织自命为各国人民自由的堡垒，但是大家都知道，正是在北大西洋公约组织成员国的武器的帮助下，阿尔及利亚人民的自由才横遭镇压，亚洲、非洲和美洲许多国家的独立被消灭或受到限制，中国人民的完全统一遭到阻挠。
    北大西洋公约组织宣称它是防御性组织，但是，它同时却在扩大最强大的进攻武器——原子导弹基地网。
    声明说，意大利人民怀着不安和愤慨的心情指出，意大利政府对缓和世界紧张局势的各种要求的回答是：企图在北大西洋公约组织范围内建立意—法—德三角联盟，阻碍任何有利于和平的进展，拒绝解决柏林问题，企图使冷战经常化，使西德的复仇主义可以任意发展。
      “意大利和平运动”书记处号召意大利人民坚决反对冷战政策和军备竞赛政策，并且要特别反对在意大利境内建立美国导弹基地。
