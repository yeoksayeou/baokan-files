Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 18th: The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council issued a statement on the 17th, calling on the Asian-African Solidarity Committees of Asian and African countries to do their best to support the Algerian people in their struggle.

The Secretariat suggested that the activities of "Algeria Week," which began on April 18, should include: raising funds to be sent to the Ministry of Finance of the Provisional Government of Algeria, organizing mass rallies, sending protest telegrams to the United Nations and the French government, and organizing newspapers and radio stations to expose the terrorist acts of French imperialism in Algeria.

The Secretariat also called on people all over the world to condemn the actions of French imperialism in Algeria and demanded that some countries refuse to provide France with military supplies to be used in the barbaric war against the Algerian people.

The statement also said, "The battle of Algeria is also the battle of Cameroon, Congo, East and West Africa, and it is also the battle of all colonial peoples."

The statement pointed out that because the French imperialists in Algeria know that they are facing their end, they are strengthening tyranny, terror, and persecution in Algeria. They are increasing their troops there and starting new offensives. But Algerian nationalists are capable of repelling these offensives and will inflict heavy losses on the French imperialists. The Algerian people know that their struggle is supported by the people of Asia and Africa and that people all over the world care about them.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 18th: The working people of Pyongyang held a mass rally on the evening of the 17th for "Algeria Week," warmly supporting the heroic struggle of the Algerian people for national independence and freedom.

Han Seol-ya, Chairman of the Korean Asian-African Solidarity Committee, said in a report at the meeting that the Korean people once again expressed warm support for the Algerian people's struggle for freedom and independence during "Algeria Week," and resolutely condemned the French colonialists' massacre of the Algerian people.

Han Seol-ya said that all good people in the world demand the restoration of peace in Algeria. We will further strengthen the struggle to stop the aggressive policies of the common enemies of the Korean and Algerian peoples—the US imperialists and the French colonialists. Victory will belong to the Korean people and the Algerian people who are fighting for justice.

The meeting passed a letter to the Algerian people. The letter stated that the Korean people will firmly stand on the side of the Algerian people who are fighting for independence and freedom.

"Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today saying that all conscientious people in the world are resolutely condemning the heinous acts of the French colonialists against the Algerian people.

The editorial pointed out that the only way to solve the Algerian problem is for France to recognize Algeria's independence and negotiate with the true representatives of the people of that country.

"Democratic Korea" published an editorial today pointing out that the French colonialists must immediately stop their brutal armed suppression and fully and forever recognize the inalienable right of the Algerian people to national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 18th: The Mongolian People's Republic began "Algeria Week" today. Social organizations in Ulaanbaatar held a mass rally on this day to support the struggle of the Algerian people.

The meeting opened under the chairmanship of L. Zagd, Secretary-General of the Mongolian Asian-African Solidarity Committee.

The meeting sent a telegram to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, expressing the Mongolian people's support for the Algerian people's struggle for national independence.

An article published in the Mongolian newspaper "Unen" today emphasized that no terror, no persecution can suppress the heroic struggle of the Algerian people. There is no doubt that the heinous and bloody war launched by French imperialism and the de Gaulle government against the Algerian people will be shamefully defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 18th: Somalilanders in Cairo issued a statement today during "Algeria Week" saying that they deeply sympathize with and wholeheartedly support their Algerian brothers in their struggle against evil and tyranny and for independence.

The statement pointed out that the heroic actions of the Algerian people in their struggle have left a deep impression on the people of the world.

The statement emphasized that they believe that victory will belong to the Algerian nationalists because, in the face of the heroic struggle of the Algerian people, the attempt of the de Gaulle elements to undermine the African, and especially the Algerian, nationalist movement is doomed to failure.

　　阿尔及利亚的斗争就是亚非人民的斗争
　　亚非人民团结理事会号召全力支持阿尔及利亚人民
    平壤和乌兰巴托举行群众大会谴责法国殖民者罪行
    新华社开罗18日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处在17日发表声明，号召亚非各国的亚非团结委员会尽力支持在斗争中的阿尔及利亚人民。
    书记处建议，在4月18日开始的“阿尔及利亚周”的活动应该包括：募集款项送交阿尔及利亚临时政府财政部，组织群众集会，向联合国和法国政府发出抗议电，以及组织报纸和电台揭露法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚的恐怖行为等。
    书记处还要求全世界人民共同谴责法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚的行为，要求一些国家拒绝向法国提供军火来用于对阿尔及利亚人民的野蛮战争。
    声明又说，“阿尔及利亚的战斗，也就是喀麦隆、刚果、东西非的战斗，而且也是全体殖民地人民的战斗”。
    声明指出，由于在阿尔及利亚的法帝国主义者知道他们已经面临他们的末日，他们正在阿尔及利亚加强暴政、恐怖和迫害。他们正在那里增加兵力，开始发动新的攻势。但是阿尔及利亚民族主义者是能够反击这些攻势的，并且将使法帝国主义者遭到惨重的损失。阿尔及利亚人民知道，他们的斗争得到亚非人民的支持和全世界人民对他们的关怀。
    新华社平壤18日电　平壤市劳动人民在17日晚上举行“阿尔及利亚周”群众大会，热烈声援阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族独立和自由而进行的英勇斗争。
    朝鲜亚非团结委员会委员长韩雪野在会上作报告说，朝鲜人民在“阿尔及利亚周”对阿尔及利亚人民争取自由和独立的斗争再次表示热烈的声援，并且坚决谴责法国殖民主义者对阿尔及利亚人民的屠杀。
    韩雪野说，全世界一切善良的人们要求恢复阿尔及利亚的和平。我们将进一步加强为制止朝阿两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义者和法国殖民主义者的侵略政策的斗争。胜利将属于为正义而斗争的朝鲜人民和阿尔及利亚人民。
    大会通过了给阿尔及利亚人民的信。信中表示，朝鲜人民将坚决站在为争取独立和自由而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民这边。
    “劳动新闻”今天发表社论说，全世界有良心的人们都在坚决谴责法国殖民主义者对阿尔及利亚人民的丧尽天良的行为。
    社论指出，解决阿尔及利亚问题的唯一途径是法国承认阿尔及利亚的独立，并且同这个国家人民的真正代表进行谈判。
    “民主朝鲜报”今天发表社论指出，法国殖民主义者必须立即停止野蛮的武装镇压，完全和永远承认阿尔及利亚人民不可剥夺的民族独立的权利。
    新华社乌兰巴托18日电　蒙古人民共和国今天开始举行“阿尔及利亚周”。乌兰巴托的社会团体在这一天举行了声援阿尔及利亚人民的斗争的群众大会。
    大会在蒙古亚非团结委员会秘书长勒·扎格德主持下开幕。
    大会致电亚非人民团结理事会，表示蒙古人民支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争。
    蒙古“真理报”在今天发表的一篇文章中强调指出，任何恐怖，任何迫害都不能镇压阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争。毫无疑问，法帝国主义和戴高乐政府对阿尔及利亚人民发动的万恶的血腥战争必将遭到可耻的失败。
    新华社开罗18日电　在开罗的索马里兰人今天在举行“阿尔及利亚周”的时候发表声明说，他们深深同情和衷心支持阿尔及利亚兄弟为反对罪恶和暴政，为争取独立而进行的斗争。
    声明指出，阿尔及利亚人民在斗争中所表现的英雄行动给全世界人民留下深刻的印象。
    声明强调说，他们相信，胜利将属于阿尔及利亚民族主义者，因为在阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争的行动面前，戴高乐分子想破坏非洲的、特别是阿尔及利亚的民族主义运动的企图是注定要失败的。
