New Victories in the Anti-Colonialist Struggle

Recently, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the people of socialist countries, and all peace-loving, freedom-loving, and justice-seeking people around the world have jointly held "Algeria Week," "Africa Freedom Day," the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, and the commemoration of "Anti-Colonialism Day." These successive international activities and the importance attached to them by progressive humanity demonstrate that the historical torrent of anti-colonialism and the struggle for and defense of national independence are irresistible, and are shaking the entire imperialist colonial system with increasing intensity.

In the past year, especially since the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution in July last year, the national independence movement has experienced a new upsurge and achieved new victories, accelerating the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system.

First, the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution and the establishment of the Republic of Iraq broke the backbone of imperialist colonial rule in the Middle East, transforming Iraq from an imperialist base of aggression and the central fortress of the Baghdad Pact into a frontier of the struggle for national independence and peace. The failure of the US-British aggressors' armed intervention in the Middle East strengthened the determination and confidence of people around the world to carry out anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles. Second, in Africa, the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria in September last year and the independence of Guinea in October struck at the political deception schemes played by French imperialism, such as the "French Community." Third, the launch of the Congolese people's anti-colonialist struggle and the victory of the Cuban revolution at the beginning of January this year pushed the national independence movement to a new stage. The entire "Dark Continent" is in turmoil. In particular, the large-scale uprising of the people of Nyasaland further shook British colonial rule in Central Africa, East Africa, and South Africa. The heroic people of Cameroon, after three years of armed struggle, are continuing their efforts. The people of Angola, under the tight control of Portuguese colonialists, have also launched an organized struggle for national independence. The Cuban people's victory in the revolution through armed struggle has become a driving force for the national independence movement throughout Latin America. The anti-US struggles of the people of Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, and other countries have been newly encouraged and strengthened. Obviously, the so-called "backyard" of US imperialism has become the front line of the struggle against US imperialism.

Characteristics of the Current Anti-Colonialist Struggle

In the past six months or so, the anti-colonialist struggle for and defense of national independence has not only been growing in scale and momentum, and involving an increasingly wide geographical range, but has also undergone some major changes, which are reflected in the following aspects:

First, judging from the current situation of the national liberation struggle, the people of many colonies and dependent countries have gradually reached maturity in politics and organization. The banner of national independence is becoming more and more distinct, the leading organizations of the national movement are becoming more and more sound, and its mass base is becoming wider and wider. Taking Iraq and Cuba as examples, Kassem, leading the patriotic soldiers, and Castro, leading the "July 26th Movement," seized power through armed coups and long-term armed struggles, respectively, raised the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and received the support of people from all walks of life and their political organizations in a national united front, with a broad mass base; therefore, it has the nature of a profound people's revolution. After the success of the revolution, the national democratic revolutions in these two countries continue to deepen and advance. In addition, the increasing development of the workers' movement and its combination with the national independence movement is also a noteworthy situation in the current national liberation struggle in Africa and Latin America. Organized, led, with clear struggle goals, and with a broad mass base, these are the guarantees for the decisive victory of the national independence movement.

Second, the national independence movements in Asian and African countries, and even in Latin America, have gradually embarked on the road of unity and cooperation, and mutual support. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in 1957, the Conference of Independent African States in 1958, the All-African People's Conference, and other important international conferences held by Asian and African countries during this period, have become links connecting the people of Asian and African countries. The struggle of Nyasaland has been responded to by the people of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, and supported by the people of British East Africa and South Africa. On "Africa Freedom Day," nationalist leaders from nine African countries, including Algeria, Zanzibar, South Africa, Kenya, Cameroon, Somaliland, Uganda, Nigeria, and Eritrea, gathered in Cairo, demanding that British, French, Belgian, Portuguese, and Italian colonialists immediately withdraw from the African continent. These examples show that the common struggle against colonialism by the people of various parts of Africa is being increasingly strengthened. In Latin America, the connections between nationalists in exile from several dictatorial countries have also become closer. Although there are some differences and contradictions between some nationally independent countries in Asia and Africa, or between some nationalist leaders, unity is still the mainstream. Unity is strength, which is the most powerful blow to the imperialist conspiracy of "divide and rule."

Third, since the Suez incident, a series of eloquent facts have proved that the national liberation struggle and the struggle of nationalist countries to maintain political and economic independence can expect to receive selfless assistance and strong support from socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and thus the friendly and cooperative relationship between nationalist forces and socialist forces has further developed. The recent economic and technological cooperation agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Iraq, granting Iraq a huge loan, is one example. The Algerian government delegation and military delegation have successively visited China, strengthening the friendship between the two countries, is another example. Nationalist forces and socialist forces join hands to jointly conduct the struggle against imperialism, which is a powerful guarantee for the victory of the national independence movement.

The Task of Anti-Imperialist Struggle Is Far from Complete

Recently, imperialist countries are being hit by economic crises, and the vigorous development of the national independence movement has further intensified the general crisis of world capitalism. Originally, the East Wind had already prevailed over the West Wind, and the accelerated disintegration of the colonial system has further weakened the strength of imperialism.

However, as Premier Zhou pointed out in his government work report at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress: "Imperialist colonial forces will not automatically withdraw from the historical stage, and the struggle for and defense of national independence will not be smooth sailing." Precisely because the recent great development and victory of the national independence movement has dealt a heavy blow to the imperialist colonial forces, making it face collapse, it will desperately struggle to continue to maintain its colonial rule. Those illusions that the task of opposing colonialism and imperialism in certain regions can be ended or is nearing completion are not only wrong, but also very harmful.

The fact is that the imperialists are still alive, and they are still running rampant in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Taking Asia as an example, some countries have only nominally gained independence, but are firmly tied to the chariots of the imperialists by the ropes of military treaties, and are subject to varying degrees of control by the imperialists in politics, economy, and military affairs. In the Arab world, ten countries have gained varying degrees of independence, but seven countries are still imperialist protectorates or colonies. Even among the ten independent countries, seven of them either have imperialist troops stationed in them or have imperialist military bases, and their independence is still incomplete. Taking Africa as an example, more and more countries are independent, but the countries or regions that have not yet achieved independence still account for more than half of the total area and population of Africa. As for the vast majority of the twenty countries in Latin America, they are still economically controlled by US monopoly capital, and some even follow Washington's lead in politics. In addition, Puerto Rico is still a US colony. Therefore, whether in Asia, Africa, or Latin America, the anti-imperialist cause is far from being completed victoriously.

Moreover, the colonizers are using all means to extinguish the liberation struggle of the people who have not yet achieved national independence. They either carry out cruel repression, massive arrests, and massacres; or play political deception tricks, giving the colonies names such as "autonomy," "republic," or "federation"; or use both soft and hard tactics. Of course, the oppressed nations who have awakened cannot be suppressed or deceived, but these struggles by the imperialists and colonizers show that they still want to cling to their exploited territories and are unwilling to let go.

New Imperialist Conspiracies

Even with regard to countries that have achieved varying degrees of political independence, the imperialists are still trying their best to maintain control, and even stage a comeback. For this sinister purpose, they are still piecing together military blocs, concluding military treaties, establishing military bases, instigating military coups, and organizing subversive activities. In the Middle East region, the recently concluded bilateral military agreements between the United States and Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, respectively, threaten the security of nationally independent countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and even India. In the Southeast Asian region, in addition to increasingly infiltrating Laos through the pro-US forces in Laos, US imperialism is also using Thailand and South Vietnam as bases to carry out blatant subversive activities against the Kingdom of Cambodia; recently, it has even gathered the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to hold the Wellington Conference, attempting to expand the scope of aggression of this group to Laos and Cambodia. The US imperialists are even unwilling to relax their grip on Cuba, which has just achieved revolutionary victory. They are stepping up the provision of weapons and money to the pro-US regimes in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Haiti, and are promoting military plans in the Caribbean region to threaten Cuba. In addition, the United States is also attempting to use the "Organization of American States" to plan the establishment of a Pan-American police force to interfere in the internal affairs of Cuba and other Latin American countries.

As Premier Zhou pointed out, "It is particularly noteworthy that imperialism is recently using all means to undermine the internal unity of these countries (nationally independent countries - translator's note), to undermine the unity between these countries, and to undermine the unity between these countries and socialist countries." For example, in order to undermine the mass base of the Cuban revolutionary regime and weaken the strength of Cuban national independence, in addition to using clichés such as the so-called "communist threat" to scare the Cuban people and divide the unity of the Cuban people, US imperialists also sent special agents to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, to stir up relations between blacks and whites, and to split the Cuban armed forces. In Indonesia, US imperialists have also done their utmost to sow discord in order to turn the army against the people. Recently, the imperialists have been trying their best to create divisions between Arab countries, attempting to create a situation in which Arabs fight Arabs, which is even more sinister. In order to undermine the friendly and cooperative relationship between nationally independent countries and socialist countries, and to place the former in an isolated and helpless position, imperialism is also resorting to all kinds of extremes: spreading the rumors of "Soviet communist imperialism" among Arab countries is one example. In Southeast Asian countries, slandering our country as a "terrible threat" to neighboring countries and engaging in "economic expansion" is another example. Recently, the US diplomatic authorities are instigating some Latin American countries behind the scenes to oppose the Soviet Union, attempting to create tense relations between Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico, and the Soviet Union. What is particularly noteworthy is that the imperialists are taking advantage of the rebellion of the reactionary upper strata of Tibet to desperately provoke the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indian peoples. In these dirty deals, there is also a share of the Yugoslav revisionists. Not long ago, Tito's trip to Asia and Africa was to play the role of Shen Gongbao in the "Investiture of the Gods" for the US imperialists. The awakened people of Asian and African countries must be highly vigilant against these conspiracies of imperialism.

Still Have to Break Free from Economic Shackles

Finally, it must also be pointed out that the achievement of political independence by an oppressed nation is only the beginning of the realization of national independence; if after achieving political independence, it cannot get rid of the control of imperialism in the economy and still has to rely on foreign monopoly capital, then its political independence will not be reliable. It is well known that the economies of Latin American countries are still controlled by Wall Street financiers, and even in many newly independent countries in Asia and Africa, imperialists still retain their economic power. Taking India as an example, its economic lifeline is still in the hands of Britain. Since 1948, foreign capital in India has increased from more than 2.8 billion rupees to 4.8 billion rupees in 1955. During the same period, British capital increased from more than 2 billion rupees to 3.9 billion rupees. Taking the UAR as another example, foreign capital in the Egyptian region reached 580 million Egyptian pounds in 1958, while the total amount of national capital was only more than 240 million Egyptian pounds. While shifting the economic crisis to these countries, US, British, and other imperialists are precisely using the economic weaknesses of nationalist countries to carry out economic aggression and infiltration. Recently, the rightward regression of the Frondizi government in Argentina, although there are various reasons, one of the main reasons is that it swallowed the bait of economic "aid" and increased investment thrown out by the United States, and thus politically succumbed to US imperialism, and violated the direction of democracy and national independence advocated during the election.

For Complete Victory

From all this, we can see that the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have indeed achieved great victories, but the struggle against colonialism and aggression is far from over; the life of the imperialists will not be long, but they still have to make dying struggles and do everything possible to retain colonial rule as their "life-sustaining soup." Therefore, the anti-colonialist struggle must be persisted in, expanded, and carried through to the end. In order to achieve the complete victory of the anti-colonialist struggle, the nationalist forces of all countries must abandon the superstition that imperialism is powerful and invincible, abandon any illusions about imperialism; they must dare to break with imperialism and resolutely struggle against imperialism; they must strengthen domestic unity, strengthen the unity between countries striving for and defending national independence, and strengthen unity with socialist forces.

It must be known that "in all countries striving for and defending national independence, any political force must solve such a problem: either break with imperialism, rely on and mobilize the power of the people, unite with socialist countries and all anti-imperialist forces in the world, so that it is possible to achieve a complete victory in the struggle against imperialism; or compromise with imperialism, fear and even suppress the power of the people; and be hostile to socialist countries and all anti-imperialist forces, so that it is inevitable to become a traitor to national interests" (quoted from "Red Flag" No. 7, 1959, Yu Zhaoli: "Imperialism is the Deadly Enemy of Arab National Liberation"). From a global perspective, with the support of socialist countries, the national independence movement is an irresistible historical trend, and it must achieve a complete victory. No countercurrent can change this general trend. However, in order to end the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly US imperialism, as soon as possible, and to achieve the victory of the national independence movement on a worldwide scale as soon as possible, nationalist forces must defeat the countercurrent and carry the anti-colonialist struggle through to the end.

    把反殖民主义斗争进行到底
    思慕
    反殖民主义斗争的新胜利
    最近，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民、社会主义国家人民以及全世界爱好和平、自由与正义的人民在一起，相继举行了“阿尔及利亚周”、“非洲自由日”、纪念万隆会议四周年、纪念“反殖民主义日”等活动。这些接踵而来的国际活动和进步人类对它们的重视，正说明了反殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争这一个历史洪流不可抗拒，日益剧烈地震撼着整个帝国主义殖民制度。
    最近一年以来，特别是去年7月伊拉克人民革命取得胜利以来，民族独立运动有了新的高涨，取得了新的胜利，帝国主义殖民体系加速地土崩瓦解。
    首先，伊拉克人民革命的胜利和伊拉克共和国的成立，打断了帝国主义在中东的殖民统治的脊梁，使伊拉克从帝国主义的侵略基地、巴格达集团的中心堡垒转变为争取民族独立、争取和平的斗争的前哨。美英侵略者武装干涉中东的失败，加强了世界各地人民进行反帝、反殖民主义斗争的决心和信心。其次，在非洲方面，去年9月阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立和10月几内亚的独立，打击了法帝国主义玩弄的什么“法兰西共同体”一类的政治欺骗阴谋。再次，今年1月初，刚果人民反殖民主义斗争的发动和古巴革命的胜利又把民族独立运动推进到新的阶段。整个“黑暗大陆”都在沸腾之中。特别是尼亚萨兰人民的大规模暴动进一步动摇了英国在中非、东非和南非的殖民统治。英雄的喀麦隆人民坚持了三年的武装斗争，正在再接再厉。在葡萄牙殖民者严密控制下的安哥拉人民也开展了有组织的争取民族独立的斗争。古巴人民通过武装斗争而取得革命的胜利，成为推动整个拉丁美洲民族独立运动的动力。委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、巴拿马等国人民的反美斗争都得到了新的鼓舞力量而加强起来。显然的，美帝国主义的所谓“后院”已变成了反对美帝国主义斗争的前线。
    当前反殖民主义斗争的特点
    在这大半年中，反殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，不但规模和声势日益浩大，所牵涉的地理范围日益广泛，而且也发生了一些重大的变化，这表现于如下的几个方面：
    第一，从目前民族解放斗争的形势来看，许多殖民地和附属国的人民在政治上和组织上已经逐渐达到成熟。民族独立的旗帜越来越鲜明，民族运动的领导组织越来越健全，它的群众基础也越来越宽广。以伊拉克和古巴为例，卡塞姆所领导的爱国军人和卡斯特罗所领导的“7月26日运动”分别通过武装政变和长期的武装斗争取得了政权，揭橥了反帝反封建的旗帜，得到了各阶层人民及其政治组织的民族统一阵线的支持，有广泛的群众基础；因而具有深刻的人民革命的性质。在革命成功以后，这两个国家的民族民主革命还是继续深入和前进。此外，工人运动的日益发展和它与民族独立运动的结合，也是目前非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放斗争一个值得注意的情况。有组织、有领导、有明确的斗争目标，有广泛的群众基础，这些是民族独立运动取得决定性胜利的保证。
    第二，目前亚非各国以至拉丁美洲的民族独立运动，已经逐渐走上团结合作、互相支持的道路。1957年的亚非人民团结大会、1958年的非洲独立国家会议、全非人民大会以及在这期间亚非国家举行的青年、学生和其他一些重要的国际会议，成为联系亚非各国人民的纽带。尼亚萨兰的斗争得到了南、北罗得西亚人民的响应和英属东非和南非人民的声援。在举行“非洲自由日”那一天，阿尔及利亚、桑给巴尔、南非、怯尼亚、喀麦隆、索马里兰、乌干达、尼日利亚和厄立特里亚等九个非洲国家民族主义领导人在开罗集会，要求英、法、比、葡、意殖民者立即退出非洲大陆。这些事例说明了，非洲各地人民的反殖民主义的共同斗争已在日益加强。在拉丁美洲方面，几个独裁国家的民族主义流亡者之间的联系也密切起来。虽然在亚非地区某些民族独立国家之间或某些民族主义领导人之间，存在着一些分歧、矛盾，但团结还是主流。团结就是力量，这是对于惯用“分而治之”的帝国主义阴谋的最有力的打击。
    第三，从苏伊士事件以来，一连串的雄辩的事实证明，民族解放斗争和民族主义国家维护政治和经济独立的斗争可以指望得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的无私援助和大力支持，因而民族主义力量与社会主义力量的友好合作关系也有了进一步的发展。苏联最近同伊拉克签订了经济和技术和合作协定，给予伊拉克以巨额的贷款，是一个例子。阿尔及利亚政府代表团和军事代表团先后访问中国，加强了两国的友谊，又是一个例子。民族主义力量同社会主义力量携起手来，共同进行反对帝国主义的斗争，是民族独立运动取得胜利的有力保证。
    反帝斗争任务远还没有完成
    最近，帝国主义国家正在受着经济危机的冲击，民族独立运动这样的蓬勃发展，更加剧了世界资本主义总危机。本来，东风已经压倒了西风，殖民体系的这样加速瓦解，更大大削弱了帝国主义的势力。
    但是，正如周总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的政府工作报告所指出：“帝国主义殖民势力不会自动退出历史舞台，争取和维护民族独立的斗争不会是一帆风顺的。”正因为最近民族独立运动的巨大发展和胜利给帝国主义殖民势力以沉重的打击，使它面临着崩溃，它就越发要拚命地挣扎，力求继续保持它的殖民统治。那些认为某些地区反对殖民主义、反对帝国主义的斗争任务可以结束或接近完成的幻想，不但是错误，而且是非常有害的。
    事实是，帝国主义者目前还是在活着，他们依然在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲横行霸道。以亚洲而论，有些国家仅在名义上获得独立，而却被帝国主义者用军事条约的绳索牢牢地缚在他们的战车之上，在政治、经济和军事上都受到帝国主义的不同程度的控制。在阿拉伯世界，已经有十个国家获得不同程度的独立，但还有七个国家依然是帝国主义的保护国或殖民地。就是在十个独立国家中，有七个国家或者驻扎有帝国主义的军队，或者设有帝国主义的军事基地，它们的独立还是残缺不全。以非洲而论，独立的国家越来越多了，但尚未取得独立的国家或地区仍占非洲总面积和人口的一半以上。至于拉丁美洲二十个国家中极大多数在经济上仍然受美国垄断资本的操纵，有些甚至在政治上也听从华盛顿的摆布，此外，波多黎各还是美国的殖民地。因此，无论在亚洲、非洲或拉丁美洲，反帝事业远还没有胜利完成。
    而且，对于那些尚未取得民族独立的人民的解放斗争，殖民者正在用尽一切方法来加以扑灭。他们或者进行残酷的镇压，大肆逮捕和屠杀；或者玩弄政治欺骗把戏，给殖民地以“自治”“共和国”或“联邦”一类的名义；或者是软硬兼施，双管齐下。固然，已经觉醒起来的被压迫民族是压不下去，也骗不了的，但帝国主义和殖民者这些挣扎，说明了他们还是要死抱着他们的剥削地盘，不肯放手。
    帝国主义的新阴谋
    即以取得不同程度的政治独立的国家而论，帝国主义者还是要千方百计地保持控制，以至卷土重来。为了这个罪恶目的，他们还在拼凑军事集团，缔结军事条约，建立军事基地，策动军事政变，组织颠复活动。在中东地区，新近美国分别同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦订立的双边军事协定，就威胁到伊拉克、阿富汗以至印度等民族独立国家的安全。在东南亚地区，美帝国主义除了通过老挝的亲美势力，日益渗入老挝之外，还以泰国和南越为基地，对柬埔寨王国进行露骨的颠复活动；最近更纠集东南亚条约集团举行惠灵顿会议，企图把这个集团的侵略范围扩大到老挝和柬埔寨去。对于新取得革命胜利的古巴，美帝国主义者更不肯放松，它正在加紧以武器和金钱给予多米尼加、尼加拉瓜和海地的亲美政权，并在加勒比海地区推行军事计划，威胁古巴。此外，美国还企图利用“美洲国家组织”，策划建立泛美警察部队来干涉古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家的内政。
    正如周总理所指出，“特别值得注意的是，帝国主义最近正在用一切办法破坏这些国家（民族独立国家——笔者）的内部团结，破坏这些国家互相之间的团结，破坏这些国家同社会主义国家之间的团结”。举例来说，为了破坏古巴革命政权的群众基础，削弱古巴民族独立力量，美帝国主义者除了用所谓“共产主义威胁”一类的陈腔滥调来吓唬古巴人民和分裂古巴人民的团结以外，还派遣特务渗入革命队伍，挑拨黑人同白人的关系，分裂古巴武装部队。在印度尼西亚，为了使陆军同人民对立起来，美帝国主义者也尽挑拨离间的能事。最近，帝国主义者竭力在阿拉伯国家之间制造分裂，企图造成用阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人的局面，更是用心险恶。为了破坏民族独立国家同社会主义国家的友好合作关系，使前者陷于孤立无援的地位，帝国主义也是无所不用其极：在阿拉伯国家中间散播“苏联共产帝国主义”的谰言是一个例子。在东南亚国家中间，污蔑我国对于邻国是“可怕的威胁”，进行“经济扩张”，又是一个例子。最近，美国外交当局正在幕后煽动一些拉丁美洲国家反对苏联，企图在乌拉圭、阿根廷、墨西哥和苏联之间造成紧张关系。尤其值得注意的是，帝国主义者利用西藏上层反动集团叛乱事件，拚命挑拨中印两国人民的友好关系。在这些肮脏的勾当中间，也有南斯拉夫修正主义者一份儿，前不多时铁托的亚非之行，就是替美帝国主义者扮演“封神榜”中申公豹那样的角色。觉醒的亚非国家人民对帝国主义的这些阴谋不能不要严加提防。
    还要挣脱经济枷锁
    最后，还得提出，一个被压迫民族取得政治独立只是实现民族独立的初步；如果在取得政治独立之后，在经济上却不能摆脱帝国主义的控制，仍要依存于外国垄断资本，那末，它的政治独立也不会牢靠。人所共知，拉丁美洲各国在经济上还是受华尔街财阀的控制，就在亚非许多新独立的国家中，帝国主义者也仍保留有它们的经济势力。以印度为例，它的经济命脉还是在英国的掌握里。自从1948年以来，在印度的外国资本已经从二十八亿多卢比，增加到1955年的四十八亿卢比。同时期内，英国资本从二十多亿卢比，增加到三十九亿卢比。再以阿联为例，1958年埃及地区的外国资本达五亿八千万埃镑，而民族资本总数不过二亿四千多万埃镑。美英等帝国主义者在向这些国家转嫁经济危机的同时，正是利用民族主义国家在经济方面的弱点，进行经济侵略和渗透。最近，阿根廷的弗朗迪西政府右倾倒退，虽有种种原因，但其中一个主要原因，就是它吞了美国所抛出的经济“援助”和增加投资的钓饵，在政治上也就屈从了美帝国主义，而违反了竞选时所标榜的民主和民族独立的方向。
    为了彻底的胜利
    由此种种，我们可以看到，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动诚然已经取得巨大的胜利，但反对殖民主义、反对侵略的斗争远还没有结束；帝国主义者的寿命不会久长了，但他们还要作垂死的挣扎，还要尽一切力量保留殖民统治作为他们的“续命汤”。因此，反殖民主义斗争必须坚持、扩大、进行到底。而为了取得反殖民主义斗争的彻底胜利，各国民族主义力量就必须丢掉对帝国主义强大不可战胜的迷信，丢掉对帝国主义的任何幻想；就必须敢于同帝国主义决裂，坚决同帝国主义斗争；就必须加强国内的团结、加强各个争取和维护民族独立国家之间的团结，加强同社会主义力量的团结。
    要知道，“在一切争取和维护民族独立的国家中，任何政治力量都必须解决这样一个问题：或者是同帝国主义决裂，依靠和发动人民群众的力量，联合社会主义国家和世界上一切反帝力量，这样就有可能取得反对帝国主义斗争的彻底胜利；或者是向帝国主义妥协，畏惧以至镇压人民群众的力量；敌视社会主义国家和一切反帝力量，这样就难免成为背叛民族利益的罪人”（引自“红旗”1959年第七期，于兆力：“帝国主义是阿拉伯民族解放的死敌”）从全局来说，在社会主义国家支持之下，民族独立运动是不可抗拒的历史潮流，一定要获得全胜，任何逆流都不可能改变这个总的趋势。但是，为了早日结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，早日取得民族独立运动在全世界范围内的胜利，民族主义力量就必须击退逆流，把反殖民主义斗争进行到底。
