    Unity Between Teachers and Students Has a Weapon

    In the Xiamen Glass Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Xiamen City, the masters were all from Shanghai and did not understand the Minnan dialect. However, the apprentices were all local and could only speak the Minnan dialect. Because of the language barrier, there were always quarrels between teachers and students, making it difficult to communicate feelings and have heart-to-heart talks in life. Once, an apprentice invited his master to visit Nanputuo Temple in the local dialect, but the master did not understand and angrily said, "Don't make fun of me!" A good thing turned into a bad thing.

    After studying the factory's language situation, the Party organization believed that promoting Mandarin Chinese, so that everyone spoke Mandarin, was an important weapon for strengthening the unity of employees in the factory. It was decided to launch a high tide of learning Mandarin throughout the factory. Therefore, the Party committee took the lead, mobilized the masses, supervised each other, taught each other, and set up a Mandarin Chinese red flag competition platform to promote the learning of Mandarin from all aspects.

    Sure enough, after several months of hard work, a new situation emerged in the factory, and everyone spoke Mandarin. Whether at work, in meetings, or during cultural and recreational activities, teachers and students were harmoniously together. People from Shanghai and people from Minnan were chatting and laughing together. (Wen Xuan) (with picture)

    师徒团结有武器
    在厦门市的地方国营厦门玻璃厂，师傅都是上海人，不懂闽南话；可是学徒都是当地人，只会说闽南话。语言不通，师徒间老是闹别扭，生活感情上难以通气，很难谈心。有一次，一位学徒用当地话邀请他的师傅去南普陀玩，师傅听不懂，生气地说：“你们不要拿我开玩笑！”好事变成了坏事。
    厂里党组织研究了全厂的语言情况后，认为推广普通话，人人都说普通话，是工厂加强职工团结的重要武器，决定在全厂掀起学习普通话的高潮。于是，党委挂帅，发动群众，互相监督，互相教学，设立了普通话红旗竞赛台，从各方面促进普通话的学习。
    果然，经过几个月的努力，全厂出现了新的局面，大家都讲普通话了。师徒间不管上班、开会、文化娱乐活动，都融洽地在一起。上海人和闽南人在一起有说有笑了。　（文宣）（附图片）
