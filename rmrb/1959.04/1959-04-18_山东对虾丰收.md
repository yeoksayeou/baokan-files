Xinhua News Agency report: Reports of abundant shrimp harvests are constantly coming from coastal fishing grounds in Shandong. As of April 12, the province had caught more than 3.58 million jin of shrimp, exceeding the output of the same period last year by four times.

Since the main shrimp group entered Shandong's coastal fishing grounds in late March, more than 8,000 fishing boats and 36,000 fishermen throughout the province have cast their nets to intercept shrimp everywhere from Qingdao in the south to Penglai outer sea in the north, and from Rongcheng Lidong in the east. In Penglai County, where shrimp groups are relatively concentrated, the fishermen are particularly motivated, catching more than 1 million jin of shrimp in five days.

At present, the vanguard of the shrimp group has entered the Bohai Bay. Fishermen in the northern coastal areas of Changwei are standing by, determined to set off another high tide of shrimp fishing in the Bohai Bay.

　　山东对虾丰收
    据新华社讯　对虾丰收的捷报不断从山东沿海各渔场传来，截至4月12日，全省已捕获对虾三百五十八万多斤，超过去年同期产量四倍。
    自3月下旬对虾主群进入山东沿海渔场后，全省八千多艘渔船、三万六千余渔民，在南起青岛，北至蓬莱外海，东自荣成俚岛一带，到处投下网具截捕对虾。对虾群比较集中的蓬莱县，渔民的干劲特别高，五天就捕获对虾一百多万斤。
    目前，对虾群的先头部分已进入渤海湾，昌潍北部沿海的渔民正严阵以待，决心在渤海湾中再掀起一个捕虾高潮。
