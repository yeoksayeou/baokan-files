Brotherly Countries Construction

    In previous years, the fields of Bulgaria were quiet during the cold winter, a time of agricultural inactivity. But last winter and this spring were truly extraordinary! Although frost and snow still covered the Bulgarian land, the fighting people broke with convention and marched towards nature despite the cold. Throughout Bulgaria, a vigorous campaign has been launched to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, and reclaim land, transforming slopes, wastelands, and areas of soil erosion into fertile fields, vineyards, and rose gardens.
    The slogan of the Bulgarian people is, "Complete the agricultural tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in three years!" The main task of Bulgarian agriculture at present is to increase crop yields, and therefore the full and rational use of land is of paramount importance. There are five million decares (each decare equals 1.5 mu) of unused land in Bulgaria. The Third Five-Year Plan has set a major task for agriculture: requiring the country's arable land to increase by one million decares each year. However, Bulgarian farmers have proposed to reclaim 2.5 million decares of new arable land in 1959. In order to accomplish this task, many places are currently launching a shock month for reclaiming new arable land. In the past three or four months, they have already opened up 600,000 decares of newly reclaimed land. The crops planted on these terraced lands will produce hundreds of millions of catties of fruits, grapes, tobacco, cotton, feed and other products, which will greatly increase the income of agricultural cooperatives and the entire national economy.

    充分地利用土地
    往年，在严寒的冬季里，保加利亚的田野上是静悄悄的，这正是农闲季节。去冬今春，是多么不平凡的季节！虽然冰冻积雪还复盖着保加利亚的大地，但是战斗的人们打破了惯例，他们不顾寒冷在冰天雪地下向大自然进军。在保加利亚全国，热火朝天地开展了兴修水利，积肥，开垦，变斜坡地、荒地和水土流失地为良田、葡萄园和玫瑰园的运动。
    保加利亚人民的口号是，“三年完成五年计划规定的农业任务！”目前保加利亚农业的主要任务是提高作物的产量，因此充分合理地利用土地具有头等重要的意义。保加利亚全国有五百万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）的土地未被利用。第三个五年计划给农业提出了一个重大的任务：要求全国耕地每年增加一百万狄卡尔。但是，保加利亚农民提出在1959年就要开垦新耕地二百五十万狄卡尔。为了完成这一任务，目前许多地方都展开了开垦新耕地的突击月。他们在最近三、四个月里就已开拓了新垦地六十万狄卡尔。在这些修筑梯田的土地上种植的作物，将生产亿万斤水果、葡萄、烟叶、棉花、饲料和其他产品，这将为农业社和整个国民经济增加大量收入。（附图片）
