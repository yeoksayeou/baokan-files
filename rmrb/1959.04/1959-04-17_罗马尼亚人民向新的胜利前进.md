　　The Romanian People Advance Towards New Victories
　　Ding Yuanhong
    In these days of warm spring breezes and the revival of all things, the diligent and courageous Romanian people, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, are spirited and full of fighting spirit, working hard on every front of the socialist economic construction of their motherland, and engaging in selfless labor to victoriously complete the 1959 economic plan.

    From Victory to Victory
    In 1958, Romania achieved brilliant results in all aspects of the national economy. The total value of national industrial production increased by 9.7% compared to 1957, exceeding the annual plan. Key sectors of national industrialization, such as steel and the chemical industry, advanced by leaps and bounds, with output increasing by 19% in one year; the socialist industrial base is growing stronger day by day. Significant progress has also been made in the socialist transformation of agriculture. People's lives have also improved greatly; the real wages of workers and staff in the socialist economic sector have increased by 26% compared to 1955.

    In order to achieve even greater victories on the basis of this victory, the Romanian Workers' Party has put forward to the people the task of accelerating the development of socialist industrialization and establishing a stronger socialist material and technical base. Last November, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party discussed the draft national economic development plan for 1959, and a magnificent construction plan was formulated after extensive mass discussion. The plan stipulates that in 1959, national income should increase by 13.5%, and total industrial output should increase by 10% compared to 1958, reaching more than five times the total industrial output in 1948. The steel, chemical, and machine-building industries will develop at a faster rate, with output increasing by 38%, 27.5%, and 14% respectively. In one year, steel production will increase from 950,000 tons to 1.3 million tons, fertilizer production will double, petroleum processing equipment will increase more than threefold, and basic construction investment will increase by 15%... These figures alone are enough to outline the scale of Romania's industrial construction this year. Agricultural production will also grow rapidly. This year, Romanian agriculture plans to make great progress in collectivization, mechanization, chemicalization, as well as soil improvement and water conservancy.

    Production Upsurge Surges Higher
    The Party's call was immediately met with an enthusiastic response from the people. The slogan "Resolutely complete the 1959 economic plan" resounded throughout Romania like spring thunder. After the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party, the working people in various regions held meetings to discuss and study the production plan, and unanimously expressed their determination to respond to the Party's call with practical actions.

    A large-scale movement to "achieve maximum savings" quickly unfolded throughout the country. Eight enterprises in the capital, Bucharest, took the lead, first proposing to accumulate 160 million lei (Romanian currency) for the country by increasing labor productivity, reducing costs, reducing the consumption of raw materials, and improving product quality. This initiative received a widespread response. Workers across the country put forward fighting slogans such as "Every worker saves at least 1,000 lei per month in production" and "Every worker proposes at least one suggestion for tapping internal potential." The production upsurge surged higher and higher, and socialist labor enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high.

    Vow to Seize 1.3 Million Tons of Steel
    Increasing steel production is an important part of completing this year's plan. The Party proposed to increase steel production by 38% compared to last year, reaching 1.3 million tons. This is a considerable task. Under the slogan of "Produce more steel and steel materials for the motherland," socialist competitions were launched in steel mills of all sizes across the country. The broad masses of workers and staff actively tapped potential, shortened smelting time, increased utilization coefficients, improved product quality, and strived to overfulfill the plan. The national steel industry center—Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine—challenged fraternal factories with advanced indicators of overproducing 45,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of iron, 6,000 tons of steel materials, and increasing labor productivity by 27%. The Reșița Steel Combine responded with overproduction of 30,000 tons of steel, 6,000 tons of steel materials, and 5,000 tons of iron. Friendly competition stimulated people's fighting spirit and promoted the production upsurge.

    Encouraging good news followed one after another. The Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine overfulfilled the January plan, producing more than 5,600 tons of steel, reaching the highest monthly output record of the factory. The Reșița Steel Combine broke through the indicators of the January and February plans, and the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces increased from 3.89 tons per square meter per day last year to 6.2 tons, achieving the highest standard since the factory was built; the Roman Steel Rolling Mill completed the first quarter plan half a month ahead of schedule. Currently, steel workers are determined to overproduce 109,000 tons of steel, 35,000 tons of iron, and 35,000 tons of steel materials, increasing steel production by about 50% within a year, reaching more than 1.4 million tons.

    The advanced banner of the steel workers is flying high, promoting the rapid advance of other industrial sectors. Coal miners in the Jiu Valley proposed to support the battle for steel with a large amount of coking coal and high-quality iron ore. The oil center of Prahova Oblast proposed to drill 10,000 meters more oil wells. All departments greatly promoted the spirit of communist collaboration and strived for greater victories.

    Strive for Agricultural Harvests
    Agricultural workers are also fighting with the same enthusiasm for a bumper harvest in agricultural production. Currently, a wave of spring plowing and sowing has been launched across Romania. A series of favorable conditions allow the broad masses of farmers to confidently guarantee increased production. First of all, the socialist component of agriculture has expanded, and the technical force has grown stronger. By the beginning of this year, there were more than 44,000 tractors and nearly 9,000 combine harvesters in the country; the broad masses of farmers plowed a total of 4.1 million hectares of land, creating the highest record in history, 44% more than in 1957, laying a good foundation for spring sowing. In order to increase grain production, various measures were taken in various places; in addition to applying chemical fertilizers during spring sowing, farmers also applied a large amount of natural fertilizers, and at the same time, launched a vast water conservancy project, and also planned to improve 370,000 hectares of land this year, of which 80,000 hectares will become irrigated land. At present, the masses of farmers are enthusiastically participating in water conservancy work, and hundreds of dams, drainage and irrigation projects have been under construction. Only five states, including Bucharest and Constanța, have proposed to expand cultivated land by 100,000 hectares and increase irrigation area by 45,000 hectares.

    The state has actively supported the farmers' plan to strive for a bumper harvest. This year, the state plans to invest 2.9 billion lei in agriculture, and a large number of agricultural machines: more than 9,000 tractors and nearly 5,000 combine harvesters will continuously enter the fields to participate in the battle. The chemical industry sector is also prepared to provide twice as much fertilizer and pesticides to supply farmers than last year. These measures provide a reliable guarantee for agricultural harvest.

    State-owned farms, which own more than 1.3 million hectares of land and powerful technical equipment, are the main force in striving for a bumper harvest; they will become the center of the national agricultural product reserves. In order to give full play to the role of state-owned farms, the Romanian Workers' Party and the government have recently made a resolution to strengthen the Party's leadership over state-owned farms. This will play a decisive role in the bumper harvest of state-owned farms.

    Collectivization Movement Flourishes
    While hundreds of thousands of farmers are working hard to strive for a bumper harvest, a climax of the national agricultural collectivization movement has also appeared. Years of practice have proved that organized farmers have great strength. For example, last year, although there was a drought, the average yield of wheat per hectare in Constanța Oblast, which was completely collectivized, was 500 kilograms higher than before liberation, and collective farms and mutual aid teams in Suceava Oblast obtained much higher yields than individual farmers, with 355 kilograms more wheat per hectare and 500 kilograms more corn. The situation is the same in other states. These vivid examples have deeply educated the masses of farmers, and at the same time, due to the in-depth and meticulous educational and persuasion work carried out by the Party organizations, more and more farmers have embarked on the bright road of socialist agriculture. The number of farmers participating in various cooperative organizations was only about 390,000 at the end of 1955, and by January 13 this year, it had developed to more than 1.9 million, accounting for 53.5% of the total number of farmers in the country. Since the beginning of this year, the collectivization movement has advanced at a faster pace. In the first two months of this year alone, ten counties and many townships have achieved collectivization. At present, among the 3.6 million farmers in the country, more than 2 million farmers have joined socialist agricultural organizations such as collective farms and mutual aid teams. The total land area of the entire agricultural socialist component (including state-owned farms) has accounted for more than 60% of the total cultivated area of agriculture. Now, a climax of the collectivization movement has appeared in various parts of Romania. Constanța Oblast has fully realized collectivization, and Galați, Timișoara and other states are rapidly advancing towards full collectivization.

    Brilliant Prospects
    At present, Romania is formulating the six-year plan for national economic development (1960-1965). As Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out not long ago, through the realization of the six-year plan tasks, the Romanian people "will enter a new stage—the stage of completing socialist construction." Brilliant prospects are presented before the people, and the Romanian people are advancing towards new victories in socialist construction with heroic strides.

　　罗马尼亚人民向新的胜利前进
　　丁原洪
    在这春风和煦，万物复苏的日子里，勤劳勇敢的罗马尼亚人民，在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，正意气风发、斗志昂扬地奋战在祖国社会主义经济建设的各个岗位上，为胜利完成1959年经济计划进行着忘我的劳动。
    从胜利走向胜利
    1958年罗马尼亚国民经济各方面都取得了辉煌的成就。全国工业生产总值比1957年增长了9.7％，超额完成了年度计划。国家工业化的重点部门如钢铁、化学工业更是大踏步地前进，产量在一年内就增加了19％；社会主义工业基础日益壮大。农业社会主义改造运动也获得了显著的进展。人民生活也有很大改善；社会主义经济部门的职工的实际工资比1955年增加了26％。
    为了在这个胜利的基础上获得更大的胜利，罗马尼亚工人党向人民提出了加速发展社会主义工业化建立更加强大的社会主义物质技术基础的任务。去年11月罗马尼亚工人党中央全会讨论了1959年国民经济发展计划草案，一个经过群众广泛讨论的宏伟建设计划制定了。计划规定，在1959年国民收入要增加13.5％，工业总产量比1958年还要大10％，达到1948年工业总产量的五倍以上。钢铁、化学、机器制造工业将以更快的速度发展，产量分别增加38％、27.5％和14％。在一年里，钢产量要从九十五万吨增加到一百三十万吨，化肥生产增加一倍，石油加工设备增加三倍多，基本建设投资增加15％……。仅仅这一些数字就足以勾画出罗马尼亚今年工业建设的规模了。农业生产也要迅速增长。今年，罗马尼亚农业在合作化、机械化、化学化以及改良土壤、兴修水利方面计划要取得很大的进展。
    生产热潮逐浪高
    党的号召立即得到人民的热烈响应。“坚决完成1959年经济计划”的口号犹如春雷一般，响遍了全罗马尼亚。在党中央全会后，各地的劳动人民纷纷集会，讨论研究生产计划，一致表示要以实际行动响应党的号召。
    一个规模宏大的“实现最大的节约”的运动迅速地在全国范围展开。首都布加勒斯特的八个企业一马当先，首先提出用提高劳动生产率、降低成本、减少原材料的消耗和改进产品质量的方法为国家多积累一亿六千万列伊（罗币名）的资金。这一倡议得到了广泛的响应。全国各地的工人纷纷提出“每个工人每月在生产中至少节约一千列伊”、“每个劳动者至少提一条发掘内部潜力的建议”等战斗口号。生产热潮一浪高一浪，社会主义劳动热情空前高涨。
    誓夺一百三十万吨钢
    增加钢铁产量是完成今年计划中重要的一环。党提出要将钢产量比去年提高38％，达到一百三十万吨。这是一项相当艰巨的任务。在“为祖国生产更多的钢铁和钢材”的口号下，全国各地大小钢铁厂展开了社会主义竞赛。广大职工积极地挖掘潜力，缩短冶炼时间，提高利用系数，改进产品质量，争取超额完成计划。全国钢铁工业中心——洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业，以超额生产四万五千吨钢、二万吨铁、六千吨钢材、提高劳动生产率27％先进指标向兄弟厂提出挑战。累希擦钢铁联合工厂以超额生产三万吨钢、六千吨钢材、五千吨铁来应战。友谊竞赛激发着人们的斗志，推动着生产高潮。
    鼓舞人心的捷报接踵而来。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业超额完成了1月份计划，多生产了五千六百多吨钢，达到了这个厂月产量最高纪录。累希擦钢铁联合工厂突破了1、2月份计划的指标，平炉利用系数从去年每平方公尺日产三点八九吨提高到六点二吨，取得建厂以来最高标准；罗曼轧钢厂提前半个月完成了第一季度计划。目前钢铁工人决心要超额生产十万九千吨钢、三万五千吨铁、三万五千吨钢材，一年内使钢产量增加50％左右，达到一百四十多万吨。
    钢铁工人的先进旗帜迎风招展，推动了其他工业部门大步前进。日乌河谷的煤矿工人提出要以大量焦煤和优质铁矿支援夺钢的战斗。石油中心普罗也什蒂州提出要多钻一万公尺的油井。各部门之间大大发扬了共产主义的协作精神，争取更大的胜利。
    争取农业丰收
    农业劳动者也以同样的热情为农业生产丰收奋斗。目前，罗马尼亚全国已掀起了春耕、春播的热潮。一系列的有利条件使广大农民满怀信心地来保证增产。首先是农业社会主义成份扩大了，技术力量壮大了。到今年年初，全国已有四万四千多台拖拉机、近九千台联合收割机；广大农民共翻了四百一十万公顷土地，创历年来最高纪录，较1957年多44％，为春播打下了良好的基础。为了增产粮食，各地采取了各种措施；农民在春播中除去施用化肥以外，大量施用了天然肥料，同时展开了浩大的兴修水利工程，还计划今年内改良三十七万公顷的土地，其中八万公顷将成为灌溉地。目前农民群众正踊跃地参加兴修水利的工作，全国有成百个堤坝、排涝和灌溉工程已施工。仅仅布加勒斯特、康斯坦萨等五个州就提出要扩大耕地面积十万公顷，增加灌溉面积四万五千公顷。
    国家对农民争取丰收的计划给予了积极的支持。今年国家计划的农业投资达二十九亿列伊，大批的农业机器：九千多台拖拉机、近五千台联合收割机将源源进入田野参加战斗。化学工业部门也准备提供比去年多一倍的化肥和农药供应农民。这些措施为农业丰收提供了可靠的保证。
    拥有一百三十多万公顷土地和强大技术设备的国营农场，是争取丰收的主力；它们将成为国家农产品储备的中心。为了充分发挥国营农场的作用，最近罗马尼亚工人党和政府已作出决议，加强党对国营农场的领导。这对国营农场生产丰收会起决定性的作用。
    合作化运动蓬勃发展
    在成千上万的农民为争取丰收而努力的时候，全国农业合作化运动也出现了高潮。几年来的实践证明，组织起来的农民具有巨大的力量。例如去年，虽然天旱，但全盘集体化的康斯坦萨州的小麦每公顷平均产量较解放前还要高五百公斤，苏恰瓦州的集体农庄和共耕社比个体农民所获得的产量高很多，小麦每公顷多收三百五十五公斤，玉米多收五百公斤。其他州的情况也一样。这些生动的事例深深地教育了农民群众，同时由于党组织进行了深入细致的教育说服工作，愈来愈多的农民走上了社会主义农业的光明大道。参加各种合作组织的农户在1955年底时仅仅约有三十九万户，到今年1月13日为止已发展到一百九十余万户，占全国农户总数的53.5％。今年以来合作化运动以更快的步伐前进，仅在今年头两个月就有十个县和许多乡实现了集体化。目前在全国三百六十万农户中，已经有二百万以上农户加入集体农庄和共耕社等社会主义农业组织。整个农业社会主义成份（包括国营农场）的土地面积已占农业总耕地面积的60％以上。现在，罗马尼亚各地已出现了合作化运动的高潮，康斯坦萨州已全部实现了合作化，加拉齐、底密索拉和其它州正在很快地向全部合作化前进。
    灿烂的远景
    目前，罗马尼亚正在制订国民经济发展的六年计划（1960—1965）。正如乔治乌—德治同志不久前所指出的，通过六年计划任务的实现，罗马尼亚人民“将要进入一个新阶段——完成社会主义建设的阶段”。灿烂的远景呈现在人们的眼前，罗马尼亚人民正以豪迈的步伐向社会主义建设的新的胜利前进。
