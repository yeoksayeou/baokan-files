Xuzhou 209 is an excellent cotton variety newly selected and bred by the Xuzhou Prefectural Agricultural Science Research Institute in Jiangsu. According to tests and observations in various provinces of the Yellow River Basin, its growth, ginning percentage, and fiber properties are similar to those of Dai Zi No. 15, but its yield per unit area is higher than that of Dai Zi No. 15. In cotton-growing areas north of the Yellow River with short frost-free periods, this variety's advantages of early maturity and high yield are particularly significant.

Liantang Early is an early indica rice variety developed by the Jiangxi Agricultural Science Research Institute using hybridization methods. This variety has the advantages of large panicles, many grains, full grains, strong stalks, fertilizer resistance, disease resistance, and good rice quality. The growing period in the paddy field is generally between 74 and 112 days. The average yield per mu of "Liantang Early" in Jiangxi is 560 jin, and the average yield per mu in Zhuji, Zhejiang, is 587 jin, both exceeding the yield of local early-maturing varieties by more than 15%.

Luganbai is a local fine variety in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, with a cultivation history of more than 30 years. This variety has well-developed root systems, thick and strong stems, strong resistance, and stable yield. It is suitable for use as a wheat crop after rice in double-cropping rice-wheat areas, and can also be used as a late rice crop in double-cropping rice systems.

Railway Rice, also known as Tiegandao, Andong Liangshui, etc., is a japonica rice variety. This variety has large panicles, many grains, early maturity, high and stable yield. Its wide adaptability and strong cold and drought resistance are other excellent characteristics. The unit yield of this variety in Liaoning is more than 41% higher than that of "Luyu 132" and 18%-40% higher than that of "Weiguo".

　　几个稻、棉优良品种
    徐州二○九是江苏徐州专区农业科学研究所新选育出的一个优良棉花品种。据黄河流域各省试验观察，它的成长、衣分和岱字十五号相近，单位产量则比岱字十五号高。在黄河以北无霜期短的各棉区，这个品种的早熟丰产等优点表现特别显著。
    莲塘早是江西农业科学研究所用杂交方法育成的一个二季早籼类型品种。这个品种具有穗大、粒多、粒满、秆硬、耐肥、抗病、米质好等优点，本田生育期一般在七十四天到一百一十二天。“莲塘早”在江西的平均亩产量是五百六十斤，在浙江诸暨平均亩产五百八十七斤，都比当地早熟品种增产15％以上。
    芦干白是江苏宜兴县的一个已有三十多年栽培历史的农家良种。这个品种根系发达，茎秆粗硬，抗逆力强，产量稳定，适宜作稻麦两熟地区小麦的后作，也可以作为双季稻的晚稻。
    铁路稻又叫铁秆稻、安东凉水等，是粳稻类型的一个品种。这个品种穗大、粒多、成熟早、产量高而稳定。适应性广，抗寒抗旱力强也是它的另一优良特性。这个品种的单位产量在辽宁比“陆羽一三二”高41％多，比“卫国”增产18％—40％。
