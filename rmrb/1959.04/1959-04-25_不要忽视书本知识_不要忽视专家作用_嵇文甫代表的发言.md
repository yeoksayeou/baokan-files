Chairman, fellow delegates:

    I fully agree with the various reports presented at the conference. Now, I would like to raise two issues regarding education:

    (1) On the issue of combining education with productive labor. Regarding this issue, after studying and discussing the educational方針 (fangzhen – policy/guideline) over the past year, and especially after more than a year of educational practice, generally speaking, everyone has a relatively clear understanding. Looking back a few years ago, it seemed like a big deal that some graduates from primary and secondary schools could not continue their studies and instead turned to industrial and agricultural production. But now, not only primary and secondary school students, but even university students, not only students, but even cadres, not only administrative cadres, but even teachers, are participating in various kinds of physical labor. During the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production last year, the vast number of teachers and students worked day and night, forgetting meals and sleep, and fought enthusiastically on various fronts. Through this experience, they have tasted the flavor of labor and developed feelings for the working people. A new atmosphere of loving labor and glorifying labor has clearly formed in society. This will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the gradual elimination of the differences between mental and physical labor, and between those who labor with their minds and those who labor with their bodies. From an educational perspective, this is indeed a major revolution. We are delighted and congratulate this great achievement. However, it should be noted that the principle of separating mental and physical labor has dominated educational work for thousands of years, and the idea of ​​disregarding labor and the working people is deeply rooted in bourgeois intellectuals. People with this kind of thinking will inevitably use various opportunities and adopt various forms to oppose the Party's educational方針 (fangzhen – policy/guideline). Eradicating this kind of thinking is by no means an easy task and requires long-term work and struggle. Therefore, in implementing the educational方針 (fangzhen – policy/guideline) in the future, we must continue to emphasize the importance of productive labor, and continue to criticize the exploitative class’s ideological viewpoints that look down on productive labor. We must not think that this issue has already been resolved and is no longer a problem.

    Of course, we must also prevent such a bias, that is, thinking that labor can completely replace education. Some students once thought that since they would have to participate in productive labor sooner or later anyway, it would be better to go home and work early than to work at school; some even said that students who paid attention to studying were taking the "white and expert road"; and some people simply started from solving the shortage of labor. Obviously, these understandings are not comprehensive enough. Education must be combined with productive labor, and labor is an indispensable part of school education. However, this does not mean that labor can completely replace education. Our educational方針 (fangzhen – policy/guideline) is to cultivate laborers, but we want to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and not laborers without culture. We know that theory comes from practice, and practice is the source of knowledge, but theory and practice are not the same thing, and practice is not equal to theory. Based on this understanding, naturally we should not completely regard the practice of productive labor and the learning of cultural and scientific knowledge as the same thing, and we should not completely replace the learning of cultural and scientific knowledge with the practice of productive labor. In terms of the relationship between direct knowledge and indirect knowledge, all indirect knowledge comes from direct knowledge. Direct knowledge is very important. Without participating in productive labor practice and without direct experience, our knowledge is one-sided and incomplete. However, in terms of the knowledge possessed by an individual, direct knowledge is always relatively small, while a large amount is indirect knowledge. The great socialist and communist construction requires us to have rich and diverse ancient and foreign indirect knowledge, and this indirect knowledge needs to be well obtained by relying on careful reading and learning. From this, it can be seen that it is inappropriate to completely oppose or completely equate labor and learning.

    (2) On the issue of the mass line in education. Relying on the masses, boldly mobilizing the masses, and following the mass line have been our Party's consistent working methods for many years. In the Great Leap Forward last year, the power of the masses was truly brought into full play. In terms of education, the masses created various new forms. Red and Expert Schools and agricultural middle schools sprang up everywhere. The masses engaged in writing poetry and painting, the masses engaged in science and technology, and the masses talked about philosophy, reversing the desolate situation of relying on a few intellectuals in the past, and creating a booming and lively climax of cultural revolution. The masses brought into play their soaring enthusiasm, dared to think, dared to speak, dared to do, and broke the superstition of those so-called "experts." Even some cutting-edge sciences that were simply unimaginable in the past have been started. Some universities have implemented the Party's leadership and the "three-way combination" of teachers and students in compiling teaching materials. With the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping, there are no fortresses that cannot be conquered. Scientific satellites have been launched, and bulky books have been written. This is truly an unprecedented spectacle. After this mass movement, profound changes have taken place in all aspects of our educational work, and its impact is also very far-reaching.

    However, we must not forget to "walk on two legs." It is naturally wrong to take the expert line without taking the mass line; it is also wrong to neglect the role of experts because of taking the mass line. Of course, the deceptive tricks of those fake experts must be exposed. But we cannot deny that there are still many experts with real talent and practical knowledge. Generally speaking, teachers still have some book knowledge and basic theories. As mentioned earlier, the knowledge we need does not necessarily have to be direct knowledge. Those book knowledge and basic theories are still useful to us. We are against dogmatism, but we cannot call everything that comes from books dogmatism, just as we cannot oppose experience in general because we oppose empiricism; we cannot say that it is "eating-ism" just because we see someone eating. We must try our best to absorb the useful knowledge of teachers and respect the leading role of teachers in teaching. This is not incompatible with the "three-way combination" and our following the mass line.

    In short, labor training and the mass line have played a huge role in our current educational revolution, making us feel extremely encouraged and invigorated. However, with the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, some new problems have naturally emerged. We must continue to advance on the basis of our current victory and strive for new and greater victories. If there is anything inappropriate, please correct me, fellow delegates.

### 不要忽视书本知识　不要忽视专家作用  嵇文甫代表的发言

    不要忽视书本知识　不要忽视专家作用
    嵇文甫代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意大会中的各项报告。现在我提出教育上的两个问题谈一谈：
    （一）关于教育与生产劳动结合的问题。关于这个问题，经过去年一年间对教育方针的学习讨论，特别是经过一年多来的教育实践，一般说来，大家已经有了比较明确的认识。回想几年前，由于一部分中小学毕业生不能升学，转而从事工农业生产，好像是多么不得了的事。可是现在呢，不仅中小学生，连大学生，不仅学生，连干部，不仅行政干部，连教师，都参加了各种体力劳动。在去年工农业生产大跃进中，广大师生没明没夜，废寝忘食，热火朝天地奋战于各个战线上。通过这一锻炼，对于劳动的滋味有所体会了，对于劳动人民发生感情了。社会上显然形成一种热爱劳动，劳动光荣的新风气。这对于脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，劳心和劳力的差别之逐渐消灭，无疑将发生深远的影响。从教育上说，这实在要算是一大革命。我们欢欣鼓舞祝贺这一伟大成就。但是应该看到，劳心与劳力分离的原则，在教育工作中统治了几千年，轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民的思想，在资产阶级知识分子中是根深蒂固的。具有这种思想的人，必然会利用各种时机，采用各种形式出来反对党的教育方针。肃清这种思想，决不是一件轻而易举的事，需要经过长期的工作和斗争。因此，在今后贯彻教育方针中还必须继续强调生产劳动的重要性，继续批判那些轻视生产劳动的剥削阶级的思想观点，不要认为这个问题已经解决，不成问题了。
    当然，我们也要防止这么一种偏向，即认为劳动可以完全代替教育。曾经有些学生认为反正早晚都得参加生产劳动，在校劳动还不如早回家劳动好；甚至有人把注意学习的学生说成是走“白专道路”；还有些人单纯地从解决劳动力紧张出发。很显然，这些认识都是不够全面的。教育必须与生产劳动结合，劳动是学校教育中决不可少的一部分，但是，这并不是说，劳动可以完全代替教育。我们的教育方针是培养劳动者，但是，我们要培养的是有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，而并不是没有文化的劳动者。我们知道，理论来源于实践，实践是认识的源泉，但是，理论和实践并不是一回事，实践并不等于理论。根据这样的理解，自然我们就不应该把生产劳动的实践和文化科学知识的学习完全看成一回事，就不应该用生产劳动的实践来完全代替文化科学知识的学习。就直接知识和间接知识的关系来说，一切间接知识都是从直接知识产生的。直接知识是非常重要的。不参加生产劳动实践，没有直接的经验，我们的知识就是片面的，不完全的。但是，就一个人所具有的知识来说，直接知识总是比较少数的，而大量的则是间接的知识。伟大的社会主义和共产主义建设，需要我们具有丰富的、各种各样的古代的、外域的间接知识，而这种间接知识是需要依靠认真读书和学习才能很好获得的。从这里可以看出，把劳动和学习完全对立起来或完全等同起来都是不妥当的。
    （二）关于教育上的群众路线问题。依靠群众，放手发动群众，群众路线，是我们党多年来的一贯的工作方法。在去年大跃进中，群众的力量真是大大发挥出来了。就教育方面来看，群众创造出各种各样的新形式。红专学校、农业中学，遍地开花，群众搞写诗作画，群众搞科学技术，群众讲哲学，一反从前依靠少数几个知识分子那种冷冷清清的局面，而造成轰轰烈烈，热闹沸腾的文化革命高潮。群众发挥起冲天干劲，敢想、敢说、敢做，打破了对于那些所谓“专家”的迷信。连过去简直不敢设想的一些尖端科学都搞起来了。有些高等学校，在编写教材中实行党的领导，教师和学生“三结合”的办法。在万马奔腾的气势下，没有攻不破的堡垒。科学卫星放起来了，大部头著作写出来了。这真是千古未有的奇观。经过这一番群众性的运动，在我们教育工作的各方面都引起了深刻的变化，它的影响也是很深远的。
    但是，我们不要忘记了“两条腿走路”。走专家路线而不走群众路线，这自然是不对的；因走群众路线而就忽视了专家的作用，这也是不对的。当然，那些假专家的骗人伎俩必须予以揭穿。可是我们不能否认，有真才实学的专家还是不乏其人。就一般教师来说，书本知识，基本理论，总多少还有些的。如前面所说，我们所需要的知识，不一定都得是直接知识。那些书本知识和基本理论对于我们还是有用的。我们反对教条主义，但是不能把凡从书本上得来的都叫作教条主义，犹之乎不能因为反对经验主义，就一概反对经验；不能一见吃饭就说那是吃饭主义一样。我们要尽量吸收教师那些有用的知识，要尊重教师在教学上的主导作用。这和“三结合”，和我们走群众路线，是并不相妨的。
    总之，劳动锻炼，群众路线，在我们当前教育革命中起了巨大作用，使我们感到极大的鼓舞和振奋。但是随着大跃进的新形势，也很自然地出现些新问题。我们要在当前胜利的基础上继续前进，争取新的更大的胜利。是否有当，请各位代表指教。
