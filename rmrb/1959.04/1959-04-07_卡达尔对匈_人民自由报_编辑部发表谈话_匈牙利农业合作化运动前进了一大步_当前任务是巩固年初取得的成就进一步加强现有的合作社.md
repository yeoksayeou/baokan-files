Budapest dispatch, April 6th. The rapid progress of the Hungarian agricultural cooperativization movement in the past three months is the most significant social event in Hungary in recent years, apart from the defense and consolidation of the people's regime. This was pointed out by János Kádár, First Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, in answering several questions from the editorial department of "People's Freedom Daily" regarding the agricultural cooperativization movement. "People's Freedom Daily" published this conversation of Kádár's on the 4th.

Kádár said that the number of peasants joining cooperatives this year has increased by 354,000, and the cooperative farmland has increased by nearly 2 million holds. This fact has not only had a tremendous impact on the peasants but has also powerfully affected the lives of the entire Hungarian people and the development of socialism. He pointed out that for ten years, a contradiction has existed in Hungary between the socialist nature of industry, transportation, and commerce and the non-socialist nature of the majority of agriculture. This duality hindered the development of the national economy. At present, this duality has been greatly reduced due to the large progress of the cooperativization movement, with nearly half of the country's cultivated land becoming socialist property.

Kádár pointed out that one of the main characteristics of the agricultural cooperativization movement in recent months has been the large number of middle peasants joining the cooperatives. They generally have rich experience in managing land, especially in animal husbandry. This is a great gain for some cooperatives and even the entire cooperativization movement.

The second characteristic is that the vast majority of farmers in many villages have simultaneously embarked on the road of socialism, with one production cooperative established in one village, thus eliminating the need to adjust land. Moreover, it is possible to make better use of local conditions for public construction.

The third characteristic is that the cooperativization movement in Győr-Sopron, Szolnok, Veszprém, and Fejér counties has developed extremely rapidly, while other counties have developed relatively slowly. This is because the cooperativization movement was formed in different regions under different conditions, through different methods, and in different periods. Therefore, the unevenness of development is also natural.

Kádár said that the resolution of the Central Committee of the Party in December last year on continuing to carry out the agricultural production cooperativization movement greatly promoted the progress of agricultural cooperativization. He believes that the rapid development of the cooperativization movement this year is healthy, and its main driving force is the growing socialist consciousness of the Hungarian peasant masses.

In discussing the reasons for these achievements, Kádár pointed out that every achievement of socialism is due to the correct policies of the Party and the government and the support of the working masses for these policies, and the achievements of the cooperativization movement are also the same. Through arduous struggles, the Party eliminated the reactionary, anti-people tendencies in agricultural policy. This tendency reached its peak during the counter-revolutionary period of October 1956, the purpose of which was not only to eliminate cooperatives but also to attempt to deprive our people of all the achievements they had made after liberation. In addition, we also overcame the right-leaning compromise attitude that emerged under the influence of the enemy's rampant attacks and the erroneous views of revisionists, as well as the sectarian attitude of distrust of the peasant masses. The principled and political firm stance of the Party Central Committee produced the correct policies and measures of the Party and the government.

The achievements of some old cooperatives, which were established early and have been tested in the past few years, have also set an example for individual farmers. The pension system for cooperative members, the dividend system for joining the cooperative with land, and the correct handling of the issue of rich peasants have all promoted the rapid development of cooperatives.

The achievements that have been made are also inseparable from the unwavering propaganda and mobilization work carried out in the countryside. After experiencing the counter-revolutionary events, Hungarian peasants have a clearer understanding of the true faces of the old judges, gendarmes, fascists, and landlords who are eager for revenge, and they also see their powerlessness. On the other hand, the peasants also saw the selfless fighting spirit of the Hungarian communists and the solidarity shown to us by the Soviet people and the people of other countries in the socialist camp. Today, every Hungarian peasant sees that the old Hungary is gone forever, and the cause of the Hungarian people, relying on the unity of the socialist camp, is invincible.

Kádár pointed out that the most important tasks of the current cooperativization movement are to consolidate the achievements made at the beginning of the year and further strengthen existing cooperatives. In particular, we must lay the foundation for large-scale management in the newly established cooperatives in winter. He emphasized that consolidating production cooperatives should be seen as the task of the entire society, just as the large-scale quantitative development of the cooperativization movement in the past few months has been the task of the entire society. Everyone should understand that consolidation work is an indispensable condition for the further development of the entire cooperativization movement.

Establishing Party and Youth League organizations in cooperatives is the most important political condition for consolidating cooperatives. If there is a force of communists united with the members of the cooperative in every cooperative, then any conspiracy of the enemy will not succeed.

Kádár pointed out that newly established cooperatives and cooperatives expanded after mergers still have many difficulties. Hundreds of holds of land need seeds, fertilizers, and machines. The concentrated livestock need barns. The Central Committee of the Party, the government, and the entire working class should provide assistance in all aspects as much as possible. But more importantly, the cooperative itself should comprehensively mobilize all forces and utilize all possibilities to solve these problems. Kádár also pointed out that strengthening leadership is also an important link in consolidating cooperatives.

When talking about the Party's policy towards individual farmers, Kádár said that the worker-peasant alliance is the most important political foundation of the country, and the peasants include cooperative members and individual farmers. We must resolutely engage in the socialist transformation of agriculture, but only by respecting and trusting individual farmers and explaining the truth to them can we guide them to the broad road of socialism. The Party and the government will continue to assist individual farmers so that small-scale farming can also improve production according to actual conditions.

Kádár finally expressed his belief that all working peasants will work diligently and will achieve greater success this year than last year in both crops and animal husbandry.

    卡达尔对匈“人民自由报”编辑部发表谈话
    匈牙利农业合作化运动前进了一大步
    当前任务是巩固年初取得的成就进一步加强现有的合作社
    本报布达佩斯6日电　匈牙利农业合作化运动在过去三个月中的迅速进展是匈牙利国内近几年来除了人民政权的得到保卫和巩固之外，最具有重大意义的社会事件。这是匈牙利社会主义工人党第一书记卡达尔在回答“人民自由报”编辑部所提出的关于农业合作化运动的若干问题时指出的。“人民自由报”4日刊载了卡达尔的这篇谈话。
    卡达尔说，今年参加合作社的农民增加了三十五万四千人，合作社耕地增加了将近二百万霍尔特。这一事实不但对农民产生了巨大的影响，而且也有力地影响着整个匈牙利人民的生活和社会主义的发展。他指出，匈牙利十年来一直存在着工业、交通业以及商业的社会主义性质和农业的绝大部分的非社会主义性质间的矛盾。这种两重性阻碍着国民经济的发展。目前这种两重性由于合作化运动大进展以后，全国耕地已将近一半成为社会主义性质的财产这一事实而大大地缩小了。
    卡达尔指出，几个月来农业合作化运动发展的主要特点之一，是大批中农入社。他们一般都有丰富的经营土地的经验、特别是从事畜牧业的经验。这对某些合作社，乃至整个的合作化运动都是很大的收获。
    第二个特点是许多村的绝大多数农户都同时走上社会主义道路，一个村成立一个生产合作社，这样便不必再进行调整土地了。而且能够更好地利用地方条件来进行公共建设。
    第三个特点是吉厄尔—索普伦、索尔诺克、维斯普雷姆和费耶尔等州的合作化运动发展得极为迅速，但其他州则相对地发展较慢。这是因为合作化运动是在不同地区的不同条件下，通过不同的方式，在不同时期内形成的。因此发展的不平衡性也是自然的。
    卡达尔说，去年12月党中央全会关于继续开展农业生产合作化运动的决议大大推动了农业合作化的进展。他认为今年合作化运动的迅速发展是健康的，它的主要推动力是匈牙利农民群众日益提高的社会主义觉悟。
    在谈到取得这些成就的原因时，卡达尔指出，社会主义的每一个成就都是由于党和政府的正确政策以及劳动群众对这种政策的支持而得到的，合作化运动的成绩也是如此。党经过顽强的斗争消除了在农业政策中反动的、反人民的倾向。这种倾向在1956年10月反革命时期达到了顶峰，其目的不仅是为了消灭合作社，而且还企图剥夺我国人民在解放以后所取得的全部成就。此外，我们还克服了在敌人猖狂进攻和修正主义分子错误观点影响下出现的右倾妥协态度，以及宗派主义的对农民群众不信任的态度。党中央委员会在原则上和政治上的坚定立场产生了党和政府的正确政策和措施。
    早期成立的，并在过去几年中经过考验的一些老社所取得的成绩。也对个体农民起了示范的作用。合作社社员的养老金制度，入社土地的分红制度以及对富农问题的正确处理，都促进了合作社的迅速发展。
    已取得的成就也是同在农村中进行的坚定不移的宣传鼓动工作分不开的。匈牙利农民经历过反革命事件后，更清楚地认识了急于复仇的旧法官、宪兵、法西斯分子和地主们的真面目，同时也看到这些人的无能为力。另一方面，农民们还看到匈牙利共产党人那种奋不顾身的战斗精神以及苏联人民和社会主义阵营其他各国人民对我们表现的团结精神。今天每一个匈牙利农民都看到、旧的匈牙利已经一去不复返，而依靠社会主义阵营的团结的匈牙利人民的事业是不可战胜的。
    卡达尔指出，当前合作化运动最主要的任务是：巩固年初取得的成就，进一步加强现有的合作社。特别要在冬季新成立的合作社中奠定大规模经营的基础。他强调说，应把巩固生产合作社看作是整个社会的任务，正如在过去几个月中合作化运动大规模的数量上的发展曾是整个社会的任务一样。每个人都应该明白，巩固工作是整个合作化运动进一步发展不可缺少的条件。
    在合作社里建立党和团的组织是巩固合作社最重要的政治条件。如果每一个社里都存在着组织起来的同社员团结一致的共产党人的力量，那么敌人的任何阴谋都不会得逞的。
    卡达尔指出，新成立的合作社和合并后扩大的合作社还有很多困难，几百霍尔特土地需要种子、肥料和机器。集中起来的牲口需要畜舍。党中央委员会、政府和全体工人阶级在各方面都要尽可能予以帮助。但是更重要的是合作社自身应全面地动员一切力量，利用一切可能性来解决这些问题。卡达尔还指出，加强领导也是巩固合作社的一个重要环节。
    在谈到党对个体农民的政策时，卡达尔说，工农联盟是国家最主要的政治基础，而农民则包括合作社社员，也包括个体农民。我们要坚决地从事农业的社会主义改造，但是只有在尊重和信任个体农民，向他们讲清道理时，才能把他们引导到社会主义的大路上来。党和政府仍将协助个体农民，以便使小农经济也能根据实际条件提高生产。
    卡达尔最后表示相信全体劳动农民都将勤奋地劳动，今年不论在农作物或畜牧业方面，都将比去年获得更大的成就。
