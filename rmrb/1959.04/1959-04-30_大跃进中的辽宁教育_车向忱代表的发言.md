Liaoning Education in the Great Leap Forward
Speech by Representative Che Xiangchen

Fellow Representatives:
    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I will earnestly implement them in my work.

    Close Integration of Education and Productive Labor
    For thousands of years, those who labored with their minds governed others, and those who labored with their bodies were governed. Mental labor was opposed to physical labor, with the belief that "all professions are lowly, only studying is noble," and physical labor was seen as lacking promise. After the introduction of capitalist education into China at the end of the Qing Dynasty, it remained detached from reality. As a result, the students produced were still "foreign students" who couldn't lift a basket or carry a load. Since the founding of New China, some educators have constantly told students that labor is glorious, but students have not paid much attention to labor, and labor education has always failed to be implemented effectively. Since 1957, when Chairman Mao put forward the educational policy of cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and with the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, Liaoning Province, like other provinces and cities across the country, has made great leaps forward in education under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Taking general education as an example, the province eliminated illiteracy among 2.27 million young and middle-aged people, equivalent to 96.5 percent of the 1957 level (consolidation work still needs to be continued). There are approximately 2.18 million people in industrial, agricultural, and spare-time education in primary, secondary, and higher education, and over 860,000 people in preschool education, an increase of 22 times compared to 1957. In primary education, there are a total of 11,350 schools in the province (including 2,163 privately run schools), with 3.5 million primary school students (including 500,000 in privately run schools), and the enrollment rate for school-age children has reached 92 percent. In secondary education, there are 492 junior high schools, 34 senior high schools, and 155 complete secondary schools, totaling 681 schools (including 20 teacher training schools and 315 secondary vocational schools), an increase of more than six times compared to 1949, with over 560,000 students. There are 2,861 privately run secondary schools with over 270,000 students. There are a total of 136 institutions of higher learning (reduced to 50 after rectification), with 44,900 students, an increase of 73 percent compared to 1957. Not only has the quantity increased several times, but the quality of teaching has also made greater leaps forward. What is particularly worth mentioning is that: First, the vast number of young students in schools have linked their participation in labor with building socialism. They have lofty ideals and full enthusiasm for building socialism, and they have worked with the laboring people to build water conservancy projects, fight drought, smelt iron, make steel, and carry out autumn harvesting and deep plowing. This has not only effectively tempered their thinking and transformed themselves, but also greatly supported the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. Many labor conditions are arduous, but the young students have overcome various natural conditions and difficulties in life with unparalleled perseverance, revolutionary optimism, and revolutionary soaring drive. Kangping Middle School reclaimed 1,600 mu of wasteland hoe by hoe this year. At the beginning of the reclamation, the ground was frozen very hard. Each strike of the hoe caused the hands to ache and go numb, but this did not scare the young students. Instead, they became more and more motivated. They planned a month's work, but in just half a month they reclaimed 1,600 mu of land.

    Through labor training, especially in the process of working together with the laboring people, the students deeply realized the greatness of the laboring people, changed their thoughts and feelings towards the laboring people, and began to have a common language with the laboring people. As some students said: "In the past, I thought there was nothing to learn from workers and peasants. This idea was wrong. In fact, workers and peasants have many noble qualities that cannot be learned from books." In labor, many students have learned skills from workers and peasants, and workers and peasants have been very patient in teaching them and helping them solve various technical difficulties. The relationship is very harmonious.

    The students' enthusiasm for labor and their changes have been deeply praised by the people. In the process of supporting the county's large-scale water conservancy efforts, 150 students from Xinmin Normal School were rewarded, and 14 outstanding collectives received certificates. There are many similar situations in other places. This has greatly encouraged the students' enthusiasm for labor training.

    Improved Teaching Quality
    Second, the close integration of education and productive labor, and the establishment of small factories in schools for machinery, smelting, forging, chemicals, woodworking, etc., have greatly improved the quality of teaching. According to the understanding of over 50 schools, since the development of work-study programs, students' academic performance has greatly improved. This is not only reflected in the large increase in the number of students with grades of 4 and 5, but more importantly, work-study programs have fundamentally enabled students to closely integrate the book knowledge they have learned with the practice of productive labor. In the past, some students could memorize the plant course very well, but when they came into contact with reality, they could not distinguish between corn and sorghum (two or three inches tall), and even could not distinguish between chives and wheat, let alone practical operation. The phenomenon of students not being able to lift a basket or carry a load was also very common. But work-study programs have fundamentally changed this situation. Now, many students can not only generally apply the theories learned in class to labor practice, but also learn faster, remember more firmly, and have more enthusiasm for learning theories because they have more perceptual knowledge. Through work-study programs, students have learned a variety of practical knowledge and skills such as prospecting, steelmaking, ironmaking, oil refining, machine building, fertilizer production, brick burning, salt drying, farming, sericulture, and raising livestock and poultry. What is particularly worth mentioning is that work-study programs have greatly promoted the ideological liberation of students. Many students have created many new products that approach or exceed international levels due to their communist style of daring to think and act. The students' creative power is amazing. For example, Quan Yongde, a senior high school student at Kaiyuan Middle School, successfully created a "leg measuring instrument" based on the theorem of right-angled triangles, which is both more economical (imported ones cost 10,000 yuan, while his design only costs 20 yuan) and more suitable than imported ones. In order to respond to the call for the entire people to smelt iron and steel, the teachers and students of Dalian No. 6 Middle School worked hard for twelve days and nights, using a stinky oil barrel to smelt steel containing only 0.14 percent carbon. Even some aviation schools have trial-produced an airplane. Universities have even created cutting-edge machinery with international standards.

    Through work-study programs, students' horizons have broadened, and their thoughts and feelings have become richer. In the past, it took a lot of effort to write an article, but the things written were full of empty words and had no content. Now, because they have participated in labor, have life experience, and their thoughts and feelings have changed, they have written many excellent works of poetry, fiction, essays, and plays. Many cities and counties have published collections of student works, which are highly praised by the people. And some college students can even write lecture notes. This is a glorious achievement that cannot be found in any era or any country.

    Enhanced Students' Physical Fitness
    Third, it has enhanced the students' physical fitness. As of the end of 1958, the number of students in the province who passed the labor-defense system was more than 1.11 million, which is about eight times the total number of students who passed the labor-defense system in the previous three years, accounting for about 80 percent of the number of middle school students. This is certainly related to the large-scale mass sports movement, but it is also inseparable from the fact that work-study programs have promoted the increase in students' physical fitness. It is generally reported everywhere that students' illnesses have decreased after work-study programs, and I have personally seen that mild tracheitis, pulmonary infiltration, neurasthenia, and stomach diseases have been eliminated through labor. They are more energetic and have gained weight. According to a survey of two classes at Dalian No. 8 Middle School, one class gained an average of 9.9 catties in weight, while the other class gained an average of 12.4 catties.

    Promoted the Ideological Transformation of Teachers
    Fourth, it has promoted the ideological transformation of teachers and major teaching reforms. In addition to participating in labor with students, the majority of teachers have also engaged in production, which is of great significance for teachers to transform their thinking, increase their production knowledge, and enrich teaching content. A teacher at Haicheng No. 3 Middle School said: "I have lived for more than fifty years, and this is the first time I have taken a dung fork. I have really lived half my life in vain." In the past, some teachers talked to farmers using nouns and terms, such as kale and tomatoes. Later, when farmers saw him, they would say, "Here comes kale." These fully illustrate that the intellectuals' detachment from the masses is very serious. In general, many teachers closely link natural science teaching with production realities and conduct teaching in connection with their hometowns. For example, physics and chemistry teachers have led students to make many instruments and teaching aids, which not only saves the state's expenditure but also consolidates the knowledge that students have acquired in the classroom. Liberal arts teachers, due to having practical experience and understanding the students, have made teaching more closely linked to reality. For example, in the past, language teachers always did a poor job of teaching political essays, but now some teachers teach them very vividly and specifically. A biology teacher at a certain middle school grafted moonflowers and sweet potatoes, but because the theory was divorced from reality, they never survived. The teacher found many "reasons" for the deaths, but none of them were the real cause. Later, he personally participated in labor for experimentation and learned from the old farmers. As a result, when he grafted two buds and applied slurry to the junction, they survived.

    Because the Party's educational policy has been implemented, the quality of teaching has been improved, the students' thinking has been tempered, and the teachers' thinking has also been transformed. However, we cannot be satisfied with the status quo and must continue to consolidate and improve.

    While Liaoning education achieved great success in 1958, certain shortcomings also emerged, that is, the amount of labor time was a bit too much, which delayed some classes. But this is, after all, a ratio of nine fingers to one finger, and besides, the few hours of class that were missed can be quickly made up. The "watchers" are bound to fail in the face of ironclad facts.

    What to do in the future? Only by earnestly implementing the Party's educational policy and combining education with productive labor well. We must resolutely, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, strictly abide by the labor time proposed by the Central Committee, and arrange it properly, neither shrinking nor exceeding it.

    In short, we must study hard, neither despise theoretical knowledge in books, nor separate it from the practice of productive labor, and truly cultivate young students into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

    Finally, I express my great indignation towards the upper-level traitors in Tibet and write a poem:

    Fantasizing about independence by relying on the enemy,
    All ethnic groups unite to denounce them,
    Quickly eliminate the remnants of the rebels,
    Expansionists, stop dreaming,
    Imperialism is bound to perish.
    Who is the enemy and who is the friend, the Tibetan compatriots know,
    They increasingly feel that the Party is dear,
    The new life of Tibet is very promising,
    Building a paradise everywhere is new,
    All ethnic groups are more united,
    The Party's policies are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

### 大跃进中的辽宁教育  车向忱代表的发言

专栏：

    大跃进中的辽宁教育
    车向忱代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并要认真贯彻到工作当中去。
    教育和生产劳动紧密结合
    过去几千年来都是劳心者治人、劳力者治于人，把脑力劳动与体力劳动对立起来，以为“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”，把体力劳动看成是没有出息的。等到清末资本主义教育输入中国以后，仍旧还是理论脱离实际的，结果造就出来的学生仍然是手不能提篮、肩不能担担的洋学生。新中国建国以来有些教育工作者对学生天天在叫劳动光荣，劳动光荣，但学生对劳动上不甚重视，劳动教育总是贯彻不下去。自从一九五七年毛主席提出培养有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者的教育方针以后，又加一九五八年工农业的大跃进，辽宁省和全国各省市的教育一样，都在党中央和毛主席的领导下大大的跃进了。拿普通教育来说，全省扫盲扫除了二百二十七万青壮年的文盲，等于一九五七年的百分之九十六点五（巩固工作尚须继续努力）。工农业余教育大中小学约有二百一十八万人左右，幼儿教育八十六万人以上，比一九五七年增加二十二倍。小学教育，全省共有一万一千三百五十所（其中民办的二千一百六十三所），小学生三百五十万（其中民办五十万），适龄入学率达百分之九十二。中等教育初中四百九十二所，高中三十四所，完全中学一百五十五所，共六百八十一所（其中包括师范二十所，中等专业三百一十五所），比一九四九年增加六倍以上，学生五十六万以上。民办中学二千八百六十一所，学生二十七万以上，高等学校共一百三十六所（经整顿后为五十所），学生四万四千九百人，比一九五七年增加百分之七十三，不但在数量上翻了几番，即是在教学质量上也有更大的跃进。特别值得提出的是：第一，广大青年学生在学校里把自己参加劳动同建设社会主义联系起来，他们对建设社会主义都怀着崇高的理想，满腔的热情，与劳动人民一起兴修水利、抗旱、炼铁、炼钢和进行秋收深翻。这不仅有力地锻炼了思想，改造了自己，而且大大地支援了工农业大跃进。有许多劳动条件是艰苦的，但青年学生们都以无比的毅力，革命乐观主义精神和革命冲天干劲，战胜了各种自然条件和生活上的困难。康平中学今年一镐一镐地开垦了一千六百亩荒。开荒之初，地冻得很坚硬，刨一下震得手又疼又麻，但这些并未吓倒青年学生，反而干劲越来越大。计划一个月的活，结果仅用半个月时间就开了一千六百亩地。
    通过劳动锻炼，特别是同劳动人民一起进行劳动的过程中，使学生深深体会到劳动人民的伟大，改变了对劳动人民的思想感情，开始和劳动人民有了共同语言。正如有的学生说：
  “过去，我认为向工人，农民没啥可学的，这种想法错了。事实上，工人、农民很多高贵品质，在书本上是学不到的。”在劳动中，很多学生向工人农民拜师学艺，而工人农民也非常耐心教导他们帮助他们解决技术上的各种困难。关系非常融洽。
    学生这种劳动热情，这种变化深受人民的赞扬。新民师范学校学生在支援全县大搞水利化的劳动过程中，有一百五十名学生受到奖励，十四个优秀集体得了奖状。其他地方也有许多类似情况。这更大大鼓舞了学生劳动锻炼的热情。
    提高了教学质量
    第二，使教育和生产劳动密切结合起来，在学校里搞机械、冶炼、锻造、化工、木工等等小工厂，大大地提高了教学质量。根据五十几个学校的了解，自从开展勤工俭学以来，学生的学业成绩大大提高了。这不仅表现在四、五分的学生大量增加，而且更重要的是由于勤工俭学，从根本上使学生学得的书本知识同生产劳动实践密切结合起来了。过去有的学生学习植物课把它背得很熟，但一接触实际连包米和高粱（二、三寸高的）都分辨不清，甚至韭菜和小麦都分不清，更不用说实际操作了。在学生中手不会提篮，肩不会担担的现象也很普遍。但通过勤工俭学就根本改变了这种情况。现在很多学生不仅一般能在劳动实践中应用在课堂上所学得的理论，而且由于感性知识多了，因而在学习理论时，也比过去学得快，记得牢，学习劲头也足。通过勤工俭学使学生学会了找矿、炼钢、炼铁、炼油、造机器、产化肥、烧砖、晒盐、种田、养蚕、饲养牧畜家禽等多种实际知识和技术。特别值得提出的是，通过勤工俭学大大促进了学生的思想大解放。很多学生由于发挥了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，创造了很多接近或超过国际水平的新产品。学生的创造力量是惊人的。如开原中学高二学生全用德，根据直角三角形的定理，创造成功“测股仪”，比进口的既经济（进口的需要一万元，他设计的只要二十元钱）又适用。大连六中为了响应全民炼钢铁的号召，师生苦战十二昼夜，用一个臭油桶，炼出了仅含炭百分之零点一四的钢。更有的航校还试制出飞机一架。大学里更造出尖端的有国际水平的机械来。
    通过勤工俭学，学生的眼界开阔了，思想感情丰富了。过去写一篇文章费力很大，但写出来的东西却是空话连篇，毫无内容。现在，由于参加了劳动，有了生活体验，思想感情起了变化，因而写出很多诗歌、小说、论文、剧本等优秀作品。很多市县刊出了学生作品集子，很受人们赞扬。而大学生有的还能写出讲义来。这是在任何时代和任何国家也找不到的辉煌成绩。
    增强了学生体质
    第三，增强了学生的体质。截至一九五八年底统计，全省合格劳卫制的学生人数为一百一十一万多，相当于前三年劳卫制合格总人数的八倍左右，占中学学生人数的百分之八十左右。这固然与在体育上大搞群众运动有关，但也和勤工俭学促进了学生体质的增加分不开的。各地普遍反映，经过勤工俭学学生疾病减少了，我亲眼看到有轻微的气管炎、肺浸润、神经衰弱和胃病等症，都通过劳动而消灭了。精神充沛了，体重增加了。据大连八中两个班的调查，一个班平均体重增九点九斤，另一个班则平均增十二点四斤。
    促进了教师的思想改造
    第四，促进了教师思想改造和教学大改革。广大教师除了与学生一起参加劳动外，有的还搞了生产地，这对教师改造思想，增加生产知识，丰富教学内容都有很大意义。海城三中有一位老师说：“我活了五十多岁，这是第一次拿粪杈子，真白活半辈子”。有的教师过去和农民谈话，不是名词、就是术语，什么甘兰、蕃茄等，以后农民见到他就说“甘兰来了”。这些充分说明了知识分子脱离群众是十分严重的。很多教师在自然科学教学中，一般都密切联系生产实际，联系乡土进行教学。如理化教师领导学生作了很多仪器、教具，既节省了国家开支，又巩固了学生在课堂上所获得的知识。文科教师，由于有了实际体验，了解了学生，从而使教学结合了实际。如语文教师过去讲政论文，总是讲不好，现在有的教师讲的很生动具体了。某中学有一位生物教师嫁接月光花和甘薯时，由于理论脱离实际，总接不活。该教师找了很多死亡“理由”，但皆非真正原因。以后，亲自参加劳动进行实验，向老农学习，结果，接两个芽，并在接合处涂浆，就活了。
    由于贯彻了党的教育方针，把教学质量提高了，把学生的思想锻炼了，把教师的思想也改造了，但我们不能满足现状，还得不断地巩固和提高。
    一九五八年辽宁教育在取得巨大成绩的同时，也出现了一定的缺点，就是劳动的时间多了一些，误了几课，但这毕竟是九个指头与一个指头之比，况且误几点钟的课很快就可以补上的。观潮派在铁的事实面前，必定是失败了。
    今后怎办呢？只有认真的贯彻党的教育方针，把教育与生产劳动很好的结合起来。我们要坚决的在各级党的领导下，严格遵照中央提出的劳动时间，恰当的安排好，既不要缩小，又不要超过。
    总之，要好好读书，既不能轻视书本上的理论知识，又要把理论知识和生产劳动的实际结合起来，真正把青年学生培养成为有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者。
    最后我对西藏上层叛国分子非常愤慨，写诗一首：
    幻想独立靠敌人，
    各族团结齐声讨，
    叛匪残余快除根，
    扩张分子休梦想，
    帝国主义必自殒。
    谁敌谁友藏胞晓，
    愈来愈觉党可亲，
    西藏新生大有望，
    建成乐园处处新，
    各族人民更团结，
    党的政策入人心。
