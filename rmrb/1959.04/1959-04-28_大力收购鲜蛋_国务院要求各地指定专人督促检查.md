Xinhua News Agency, 26th – It is currently the peak season for fresh egg production. The Fifth Office of the State Council recently issued a notice requiring commercial departments in all regions to strengthen the work of purchasing fresh eggs.

The notice said that since the peak season for fresh egg production began, the amount of fresh eggs entering the market has been increasing daily, and the state's purchase volume has also been gradually rising. For example, Hubei Province purchased an average of 140,000 jin per day in mid-March, and the daily purchase volume rose to 240,000 jin in late March. The purchase volume of Hunan, Anhui and other provinces has also increased significantly. However, the purchase work in some areas has not kept pace accordingly, which should be taken seriously by all regions.

The notice requires people's committees at all levels to strengthen leadership, organize all forces, seize the current peak season for fresh eggs, and vigorously carry out purchase work. Commercial departments at all levels, especially grassroots commercial departments, must have dedicated agencies or designate specific personnel to focus on fresh egg purchase work, and conduct supervision and inspection on a ten-day, monthly, and quarterly basis. The sales contracts signed by commercial departments and people's communes should be implemented to the production teams.

The notice said that local industrial and commercial administrative departments must strengthen the market management of fresh eggs. In order to transport fresh eggs to cities or processing plants in a timely manner and avoid spoilage, all regions should actively raise packaging materials and organize transportation forces to ensure the smooth completion of export and transfer tasks. A comprehensive arrangement should also be made for the processing of frozen eggs, dried eggs, and wet eggs.

    大力收购鲜蛋
    国务院要求各地指定专人督促检查
    新华社26日讯　目前正是鲜蛋生产旺季。国务院第五办公室最近发出通知，要求各地商业部门加强对鲜蛋的收购工作。
    通知说，鲜蛋生产自进入旺季以来，上市量日渐增多，国家的收购量也逐步上升。如湖北省3月中旬平均日收十四万斤，下旬日收量上升至二十四万斤。湖南、安徽等省的收购量也有很大的增长。但是，有些地区收购工作还没有相应地跟上去，应该引起各地重视。
    通知要求各级人民委员会加强领导，组织各方面的力量，抓紧当前鲜蛋上市旺季，大力开展收购工作。各级商业部门特别是基层商业部门必须有专责机构或指定专人来抓鲜蛋收购工作，按旬、按月、按季进行督促检查。商业部门与人民公社签订的交售合同应落实到生产队。
    通知说，各地工商行政部门必须加强鲜蛋的市场管理。为了及时把鲜蛋运到城市或加工厂，避免腐臭变质，各地应积极筹措包装物料和组织运输力量，以保证出口和外调任务的顺利完成。对冰蛋、干蛋、湿蛋等加工工作也要进行全面安排。
