Xinhua News Agency, 16th. Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, pointed out in his speech at the National Mechanical Industry Workers' Competition Broadcast Meeting on Completing the Six Major Equipments Quickly, Well, and Economically that the national mechanical industry workers are vigorously launching a battle to manufacture the six major equipments. This is not an ordinary battle, but a crucial battle to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's grand plan for the continued great leap forward in the national economy! He asked all workers in the mechanical industry front to fight this battle well.

Bo Yibo proposed that to fight this battle well, we must first engage in a major technical revolution and overcome the technical barriers. Although the production of the six major equipments does not all involve new technologies, the production technology of most products is relatively complex, and many factories are producing them for the first time, so the workers are still relatively unfamiliar with them; at the same time, there are still some problems with equipment capacity. Taking the manufacture of rolling steel equipment as an example, many large castings and forgings are needed in terms of blanks, but general factories lack large thermal processing equipment, such as large furnaces, large forging equipment, and large cranes; in terms of cold processing, many key processes, such as equipment for processing herringbone gears, spline shafts, and reduction gears, are weak links in some factories. Therefore, to successfully complete the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipments, we should vigorously engage in technical revolution and strive to overcome the technical barriers. In last year's Great Leap Forward, many factories made many valuable creations in improving tools and equipment, improving product design, improving processes, and saving raw materials, and constantly broke through technical barriers. I firmly believe that as long as we continue to break superstitions, engage in major technical revolution, and humbly learn from and study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries, certain technical difficulties in manufacturing that stand in our way can be overcome.

Second, we must ensure the quality of products. Not only must we have a great leap forward in quantity, but also in quality. It should be emphasized here that our mechanical factories should ensure the quality of every screw, every part, and every set of equipment. Comrades know that the quantity and time limit we require are all based on ensuring quality; if the quality is not up to standard, even if it is manufactured on time and in quantity, it will not be able to truly exert its due role, and may even cause great waste, which deserves special attention. Many factory workers have already noticed this, which is very good, and should be given constant attention in the future. However, many enterprises do not pay enough attention to product quality. In order to ensure the quality of products, in addition to improving the quality of product design, we must abide by process discipline in manufacturing; modifications to product designs and operating procedures should be approved by a certain authority; a product inspection system should be established and improved; and the use of substitute materials should be tested.

Third, we must do a good job in the complete supply of equipment. The complete set issue of the six major equipments is a very important issue. We know that the manufacture of each piece of modern industrial equipment must go through thousands of processes and requires the cooperation of several, dozens, or hundreds of factories to produce. In addition to the main equipment, each set of equipment also has many auxiliary equipment. The so-called auxiliary equipment is not something that is dispensable, it is an indispensable condition for the operation of the entire set of equipment, and without it, production cannot be carried out. For example, a three-ton steelmaking converter has a body and blower weighing about 40 tons, but the auxiliary equipment that cooperates with it for production, such as cranes, steel ladles, iron ladles, slag pans, ingot molds and casting base plates, ingot cars, pig iron furnaces, charging cans, and scales, requires a total of 79 sets, with a total output of more than 270 tons. The same is true for power station equipment. In addition to the three main equipments of generators, turbines, and boilers, a thermal power station also needs more than 100 kinds of auxiliary equipment such as heat exchangers, condensers, deaerators, coal crushing equipment, electric meters, switches, transformers, cables, and electrical porcelain to cooperate into a complete set. If the power generation equipment is not complete, it cannot generate electricity. Therefore, the mechanical industry department must not only deliver goods to the country as soon as possible, with guaranteed quality and quantity, but also ensure that the manufactured equipment is complete. Therefore, as long as it is a factory that undertakes the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipments, whether it is a large factory or a small factory, whether it produces main engines or auxiliary machines or parts, or even produces screws, it should feel the importance and glory of the tasks it undertakes, and should go all out to ensure supply.

Fourth, we must do a good job in collaboration. In order to do a good job in the complete set of equipment, so as to complete the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipments quickly, well, and economically, we must do a good job in collaboration. Within the mechanical industry department, we should give full play to the spirit of communist cooperation, support each other, and work together in accordance with the principle of the whole country as a chessboard. This is the only way to ensure that the products are complete. The staff of departments closely related to mechanical industrial production, such as metallurgy, coal, and chemical industry, should also provide strong support to ensure the timely supply of raw materials, collaborative parts, and accessories needed by the mechanical industry; railway and other transportation departments should ensure timely transportation, so that the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipments can be successfully completed.

Fifth, we must launch a mass movement. The most reliable guarantee for completing the manufacturing tasks of the six major equipments in a more, faster, better, and more economical way is to launch a mass movement under the unified leadership of the Party. This is the case for small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is also the case for large enterprises. The practice of many enterprises has proved that the current mass movement on the industrial front must be centered on technical revolution and aimed at increasing production and practicing economy. In order to fully mobilize the masses to engage in major technical revolution, we must continue to implement the system of cadres participating in production, workers participating in management, reforming unreasonable rules and regulations, establishing reasonable rules and regulations, and combining leading cadres, workers, technicians, and staff members. To better follow the mass line, I suggest that the industrial leading organs in various regions should convene a five-level cadre meeting every year at an appropriate time, with the participation of factory directors, workshop directors, work section chiefs, production team leaders, and activists from the masses. The meeting can be held two to three times a year, with each session lasting five to seven days. At the meeting, discuss production tasks and study specific measures to ensure the completion of the tasks, and explain the tasks and measures to all employees, let everyone debate, so that the factory's production indicators become the goal of struggle for every employee, and that every measure can be implemented among the masses to achieve the expected results.

### 薄一波同志在机械工业职工竞赛广播大会上提出  一定要打好制造六大设备这一仗

　　薄一波同志在机械工业职工竞赛广播大会上提出
　　一定要打好制造六大设备这一仗
    新华社16日讯　中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波，今天在全国机械工业职工多快好省地完成六大设备竞赛广播大会上讲话中指出，全国机械工业职工正在轰轰烈烈地开展制造六大设备的战斗。这不是普普通通的战斗，而是一场为保证完成和超额完成今年国民经济继续大跃进的宏伟计划的关键性战斗！他要求机械工业战线上的全体职工同志们一定要打好这一仗。
    薄一波提出，要打好这一仗，首先要大闹技术革命，过好技术关。六大设备的生产虽然不都是新的技术，但是，多数产品的生产技术比较复杂，而且许多工厂又都是第一次生产，职工同志们对它还比较生疏；同时，在设备能力上也还存在一些问题。拿轧钢设备的制造来说，在毛坯方面需要很多大型的铸件和锻件，可是一般工厂都缺乏大型的热加工设备，如大炉子、大锻压设备、大吊车等；在冷加工方面的很多关键性的工艺，如加工人字齿轮、梅花轴槽、减速齿轮等部件的设备，在一些工厂也都是薄弱环节。因此，要胜利地完成六大设备的制造任务，应当大搞技术革命，努力过好技术关。在去年大跃进中，很多工厂在改进工具、设备方面，在改进产品设计方面，在改进工艺方面，在节约使用原材料方面，都有不少宝贵的创造，不断地突破了技术关。我深信只要继续破除迷信，大搞技术革命，虚心学习和钻研苏联的以及其他国家的先进经验，横在我们面前的制造技术上的某些困难，都是可以克服的。
    第二，要确实保证产品的质量。不但要数量上大跃进，而且在质量上也要大跃进。这里要强调地提到，我们的各个机械工厂，应当从每个螺丝钉，每个部件，直到每台每套设备，都要保证质量。同志们知道：我们要求的数量、期限，都是以保证质量为前提的；质量不合格，即使如期、如数地制造了出来，也不能够真正地发挥出它的应有的作用，甚至会造成很大浪费，这值得特别注意。现在许多工厂的职工，已经注意到了这一点，这很好，今后还要经常加以重视。但是，也有不少企业对于产品质量重视不够。为了保证产品的质量，除了提高产品设计的质量以外，在制造方面，必须遵守工艺纪律；修改产品设计和操作规程应当经过一定机关的批准；应当建立和健全产品的检验制度；使用代用材料应当经过试验。
    第三，要做好设备的成套供应工作。六大设备制造的成套问题，是一个十分重要的问题。我们知道，现代工业的每一种设备的制造，都要经过成千上万道工序，需要几个、几十个或者上百的工厂配合协作才能生产出来。每套设备，除了主要设备以外，还有许多辅助设备。所谓辅助设备，并不是可有可无的东西，它是整套设备进行运转所不可缺少的条件，少了它，就不能进行生产。如一座三吨的炼钢转炉，它的炉体、鼓风机等主体设备的重量大约四十吨，但是配合它进行生产的辅助设备，如起重吊车、钢水缶、铁水缶、渣盘、钢锭模和浇铸底盘、钢锭车、化铁炉、加料缶、磅秤等设备则共需七十九台（套），总产量达二百七十吨之多。电站设备也是这样，一个火力发电站，除了发电机、汽轮机、锅炉三大主要设备以外，还要有热交换器、凝气器、除氧器、给煤破碎设备、电表、开关、变压器、电缆、电瓷等一百多种辅助设备，才能配合成套。发电设备如果不成套，就发不出电来。因此，机械工业部门，不但要尽早地按质、按量地向国家交货，并且一定要使制造出来的设备都能成套。因此，只要是担负六大设备制造任务的工厂，不论它是大厂，还是小厂；也不论是生产主机、还是辅机或者配件，甚至是生产螺丝钉，都应当感到自己所担负任务的重大和光荣，都应当全力以赴，保证供应。
    第四，要搞好协作。为了做好设备成套的工作，以便多快好省地完成六大设备的制造任务，必须搞好协作。在机械工业部门内，应当根据全国一盘棋的方针，发挥高度的共产主义协作精神，互相支援，通力合作。这样才能确保产品成套。同机械工业生产有密切联系的部门，如冶金、煤炭、化工等部门的职工，也要大力支援，保证机械工业所需要的原料材料、协作件、配件的按时供应；铁路等交通运输部门要保证及时运输，使六大设备的制造任务胜利完成。
    第五，要大搞群众运动。多、快、好、省地完成六大设备的制造任务，最可靠的保证是在党的统一领导下大搞群众运动。这在中小型企业是如此，大型企业也是如此。许多企业的实践证明，当前工业战线上的群众运动必须以技术革命为中心，以增产节约为目标。为了充分发动群众大搞技术革命，要继续贯彻执行干部参加生产，工人参加管理，改革不合理的规章制度，建立合理的规章制度，领导干部、工人、技术人员和职员相结合的制度。要更好地走群众路线，我建议各个地区的工业领导机关今后每年应当在适当的时机召开有厂长、车间主任、工段长、生产组长和群众中的积极分子参加的五级干部会议，一年可以召开两次到三次，每次会期五天到七天，在会议上讨论生产任务和研究保证完成任务的具体措施，并且把任务和措施向所有的职工交代清楚，让大家进行辩论，使工厂的生产指标成为每一个职工的奋斗目标，使每一项措施都能够在群众中贯彻执行，以收到预期的效果。
