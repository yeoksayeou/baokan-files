    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 4th: Rice seedlings are green before willow branches turn green. In the Hangjiahu area of Zhejiang Province, where early rice seedlings were usually sown around the time of the Qingming Festival, all sowing was completed before the "Vernal Equinox" this year, one to two weeks earlier than in previous years. This year, some rice seedlings sprouted earlier than the willow trees, becoming the earliest harbingers of spring. Transplanting is about to begin.
    In order to cultivate strong early rice seedlings, the Hangjiahu area has carefully managed the seedling fields sown early in the cold. The Secretary of the Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and leaders at all levels have gone deep into the people's communes to conduct experiments on the earliest batch of sown and strong seedlings, specifically leading the seedling cultivation work of early-sown seedling fields in the entire region. Under the leadership of leaders at all levels, about hundreds of thousands of commune members slept in the fields, caring for the growth of seedlings meticulously. In some places, because it was cold and the rice seeds did not sprout, people dug pits at both ends of the seedling fields and set up stoves, using rice husks, weeds, and turf as fuel, burning ash fertilizer on one side, and pouring the heated water into the seedling field ditches, raising the field water temperature to 30 degrees Celsius. This not only ensured the germination of the rice seeds but also promoted the rapid growth of the seedlings.

    春分不到播完种　柳枝未青秧先绿
    浙江
    据新华社杭州4日电　柳枝未青秧先绿，以往要到清明前后才开始早稻播种育秧的浙江杭嘉湖地区，今年在“春分”前就已全部播种完毕，比往年提早了一、二十天。今年有的秧苗比柳树还先绽新芽，成了最早的报春使者。目前插秧即将开始。
    杭嘉湖地区为了培育早稻壮秧，对凌寒早播的秧田进行了精心管理。中共嘉兴地委书记和各级领导干部都深入到人民公社，进行最早一批播种育壮秧的试验，具体领导全区早播秧田的育秧工作。在各级领导干部的带动下，全区约有十多万个社员睡到田头，无微不至地关心秧苗的生长。有的地方因为天凉，谷种出不来芽，人们就在秧田的两头挖坑设灶，用砻糠、杂草、草皮作燃料，一面烧制灰肥，一面把烧热的水灌进秧田沟里，使田水温度升高到摄氏三十度，这样，不仅保证了谷种出芽，还催使秧苗快速生长。
