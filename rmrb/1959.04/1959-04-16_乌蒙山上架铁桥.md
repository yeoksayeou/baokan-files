　　Iron Bridge Erected on Wumeng Mountain
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On Wumeng Mountain, which the Red Army passed during the Long March, Railway Corps soldiers and civilian workers are speeding up the construction of the Tianshengqiao (Natural Bridge) Bridge on the Neijiang-Kunming Railway line. This bridge spans the Kedu River at the junction of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and is an important part of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway project. It is 530 meters long and 76 meters high.
    Currently, thousands of Railway Corps soldiers are quarrying stone on the steep cliffs, some are drilling into the mountainside amidst the clouds and fog to fell timber, and others are pouring concrete for the bridge piers. One-sixth of the bridge project has now been completed.
    There was originally a "Natural Bridge" at the junction of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and the Kedu River below the bridge was originally called the "Uncrossable River." According to local legend, ten thousand years ago, two "immortals" saw that the "Uncrossable River" was like a sharp blade inserted between Yunnan and Guizhou, preventing people on both sides from passing. Therefore, they built a "Natural Bridge" between the two mountains, and people renamed the "Uncrossable River" the Kedu River (Crossable River). However, this matter was blocked by the evil god of Wumeng Mountain, who sent fierce beasts to guard the bridgehead, harming passing pedestrians. From then on, there was no human habitation within a hundred miles, and transportation between Yunnan and Guizhou was cut off. For thousands of years, the local people have hoped to restore this transportation line, but they have never been able to find kind-hearted "immortals" again. Now, the Railway Corps soldiers and civilian workers are using their own hands to turn the people's wishes into reality, which is deeply welcomed by the local people.

### 乌蒙山上架铁桥

　　乌蒙山上架铁桥
    据新华社讯　在红军长征时经过的乌蒙山上，铁道兵和民工们正在加紧修建内昆铁路线上的天生桥大桥。这座大桥横跨云贵两省交界处的可渡河，是内昆铁路的重要工程之一。长五百三十公尺，高七十六公尺。
    目前，成千上万的铁道兵正在陡壁上劈山采石，有的钻进了山腰云雾间砍伐木材，或给桥墩灌注混凝土。现在，已经完成大桥工程的六分之一。
    云贵两省交界处原来就有一座“天生桥”，桥下的可渡河原来叫做“不可渡河”。据当地人民传说：在万年以前，有两个“仙人”因为看到“不可渡河”像一把利刃般地插在云贵之间，使两岸人民无路可通。因此在两山之间筑起了一座“天生桥”，人们便把“不可渡河”改名为可渡河了。但是，这事为乌蒙山恶神所阻，派来猛兽镇守桥头，伤害过往行人，从此百里之内没有人烟，云贵交通也因此断绝了。几千年以来，当地人民就盼望能恢复这一条交通线，但是却再也找不到好心的“仙人”了。现在，铁道兵和民工们正在用自己的双手，把人民的心愿变成现实，深受当地人民的欢迎。
