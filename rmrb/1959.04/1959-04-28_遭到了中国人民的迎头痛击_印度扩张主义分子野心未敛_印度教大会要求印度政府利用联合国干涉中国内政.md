Xinhua News Agency, April 27th dispatch from New Delhi: The Chairman of the Indian Socialist Party, Limaye, arrogantly attacked the Chinese government at the Third Annual Conference of the party held in Benares on the 25th. He clamored, "I cannot find words strong enough to condemn the bloody suppression of the Tibetan people's rebellion by the Chinese Communist government."

He described our country's peaceful liberation of Tibet, exercising its sacred sovereignty, as "aggression," saying: "Prime Minister Nehru must bear primary responsibility for this tragedy, because he acquiesced eight years ago to China's aggression against Tibet in the name of Panchsheel and a reactionary, outdated concept. This concept is the suzerainty of major nations over peace-loving, smaller nations."

The Working Committee meeting of the All-India Hindu Congress, which closed in Lucknow on the 26th, even passed a resolution demanding that the Indian government submit the Tibetan rebellion, which is purely China's internal affair, to the United Nations, attempting to seek help from the reactionary forces in the United Nations to usurp the name of the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs.

This resolution also arrogantly demanded that the Indian government point out to the Chinese government that "due to India's spiritual, social, religious, and geographical connections with Tibet, India actively hopes that China will recognize and respect Tibet's 'autonomy,' guarantee the Tibetan way of life, and declare unequivocally that it will never attempt to forcibly impose international communism in Tibet."

People can clearly see that after the Indian expansionists were hit head-on by the Chinese people, they should have understood that their ambition to secede China's territory could not be realized, but this resolution shows that they have not abandoned this ambition.

Xinhua News Agency, April 26th dispatch: According to the Indian News Service, the Indian so-called "Support Tibet Committee" issued a statement in Mumbai on the 24th, clamoring that the speeches of Panchen Erdeni and others at the National People's Congress were "rude slander" against India and an "insult to the dignity and integrity of the Indian government."

This reactionary organization of Indian expansionists, which openly aims at interfering in China's internal affairs and supporting the Tibetan rebellion, was established as early as March 27th. Its chairman is Morias, the editor-in-chief of the pro-American "Indian Express," who has been very active in this anti-China movement.

This organization, which fundamentally does not represent the will of the Indian people, is trying its best to damage the friendly feelings between the people of India and China. In its statement, it incited the Indian people to say, "Every Indian will unreservedly refute these rude slanders against our people and government."

This statement, in the identity and tone of an unglamorous heir to British imperialism, said that India "gave up" all the privileges it inherited from Britain in Tibet; on the contrary, China not only did not give up its "privileges," but also wanted to "completely annex Tibet" to expand its "privileges."

This "committee" also advocated using the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. It "called on" the Indian government to "submit" the issue of China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion to the United Nations, thereby "safeguarding the Tibetan people's demands for national independence and self-determination."

### 遭到了中国人民的迎头痛击  印度扩张主义分子野心未敛  印度教大会要求印度政府利用联合国干涉中国内政

    遭到了中国人民的迎头痛击
    印度扩张主义分子野心未敛
    印度教大会要求印度政府利用联合国干涉中国内政
    新华社27日讯　新德里消息：印度社会党的主席利马伊，25日在这个党在贝拿勒斯举行的第三届年会上嚣张地攻击中国政府。他叫嚷说，“我找不到足够有力的字眼来谴责中国共产党政府对西藏人民的叛乱进行的血腥镇压”。
    他把我国行使神圣主权和平解放西藏，说成是“侵略”，说什么：“尼赫鲁总理必须对这次悲剧负主要责任，因为他八年前默许中国在潘查希拉和一个反动的过时的概念的名义下侵略西藏。这个概念就是主要民族对爱好和平的弱小民族的宗主权。”
    26日在勒克瑙闭幕的全印度教大会工作委员会会议居然通过决议，要印度政府把纯属中国内政的西藏叛乱事件提交联合国，妄图求助于联合国中的反动势力盗用联合国的名义来干涉中国内政。
    这项决议还狂妄地要印度政府向中国政府指出，“由于印度同西藏在精神、社会、宗教和地理上的联系，印度积极希望，中国承认并尊重西藏的‘自治’，保障西藏人的生活方式，并且毫不含糊地宣布，决不企图强行在西藏推行国际共产主义”。
    人们清楚地看到印度扩张主义分子遭到中国人民迎头痛击之后，理应明白它们妄图割裂中国领土的野心无法实现，但是这项决议表明它们还没有放弃这种野心。
    新华社26日讯　据印度新闻处报道，印度所谓“支援西藏委员会”24日在孟买发表声明，叫嚣说班禅额尔德尼等在全国人民代表大会上的发言是对印度的“粗暴诽谤”，是“对印度政府的尊严和正直的侮辱”。
    这个公开以干涉我国内政、支持西藏叛乱为宗旨的印度扩张主义者的反动组织早在3月27日即已成立。它的主席是这次攻击中国的运动中十分卖力的亲美的“印度快报”的主编摩里亚斯。
    这个根本不代表印度人民意志的组织竭力企图损害印中两国人民的友好感情，它在声明中向印度人民煽动说，“每个印度人都会毫无保留地驳斥对我国人民和政府的这些粗暴的诽谤”。
    这篇声明以英帝国主义不光采的衣钵继承者的身份和口吻说，印度“放弃了”它从英国手里继承的在西藏的一切特权；相反，中国不仅仅没有放弃它的“特权”，反而要“完全吞并西藏”，来扩大它的“特权”。
    这个“委员会”也鼓吹利用联合国来干涉中国内政，它“呼吁”印度政府把中国平定西藏叛乱的问题“提交”联合国，从而“维护西藏人民对民族独立和自决权的要求”。
