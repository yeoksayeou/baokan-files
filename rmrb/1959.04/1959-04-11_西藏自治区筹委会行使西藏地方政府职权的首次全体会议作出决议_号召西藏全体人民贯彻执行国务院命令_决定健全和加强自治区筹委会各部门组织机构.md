Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 10th - Resolution of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region on implementing the State Council's order of March 28.

The local government of Tibet and the reactionary upper-class clique have openly embarked on the criminal road of betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people. They have colluded with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, gathered bandits to carry out rebellion, harm the people, kidnap the Dalai Lama, tear up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and on the night of March 19, directed the local Tibetan army and rebels to launch a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa. We express our utmost indignation at this crime of betraying the motherland and the people. At the same time, we express our heartfelt thanks and cordial greetings to the heroic People's Liberation Army which quickly quelled the Lhasa rebellion. We fully support the State Council's order of March 28 on thoroughly quelling the rebellion, dissolving the local government of Tibet, and having the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercise the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet. We will resolutely and thoroughly implement the order to quell the rebellion and the central government's policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service" towards the rebels. In order to quickly and thoroughly quell the rebellion, we call on all monks and laypeople of all ethnic groups and circles in Tibet to take immediate action, earnestly implement the State Council's order and the regulations and tasks announced in the proclamations of the Tibet Military Region and local military control committees, vigorously support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion, eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and stabilize social order. Do not listen to the rumors of reactionary elements, and actively engage in production. Administrative personnel at all levels of the former local government of Tibet should immediately register with the local military control committee or military representative, and be effectively responsible for the safekeeping of public property and documents, awaiting disposition, and must not engage in any sabotage or illegal activities. Administrative personnel at all levels of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, as well as all monks and laypeople, must unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, work together, assist the People's Liberation Army to quickly quell the rebellion, consolidate national defense, consolidate the unity of the motherland and national unity, protect the interests of all ethnic groups, stabilize social order, and strive to build a new, democratic, and socialist Tibet. April 8, 1959
