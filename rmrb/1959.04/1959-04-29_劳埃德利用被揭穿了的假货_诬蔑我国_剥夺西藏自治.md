Xinhua News Agency, April 28th, London Dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd once again spoke yesterday in the British House of Commons about the Tibetan issue, which is purely China's internal affair. He groundlessly slandered the Chinese government for "depriving Tibet of autonomy."

When a member of parliament asked Lloyd to make a statement on the situation in Tibet, Lloyd, in his response, first quoted the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian foreign officials in Tezpur on April 18, which stated that "In fact, after the Chinese army occupied Tibet, the Tibetan government did not enjoy any degree of autonomy, even in internal matters, and the Chinese government exercised full power over Tibetan affairs." He used this passage as a basis to slander China. He said, "The Queen's government has always believed that Tibet should be regarded as an autonomous region. Therefore, we express our regret for any actions taken by the Chinese government to deprive Tibet of its autonomy."

Lloyd avoided touching on the fact that the so-called "autonomy" of British imperialism is a euphemism for dividing other countries' territories. He also dared not answer the Chinese public opinion's condemnation that British imperialism in the past, under the guise of so-called "Tibetan autonomy," carried out the aggressive act of splitting China's territory of Tibet.

When Lloyd spoke absurdly about the implementation of regional autonomy in Tibet, he forgot the fundamental point: no matter what the situation in Tibet is, it is China's internal affair, and the British government is not allowed to interfere. The era of British aggression and manipulation of Tibet is gone forever.

### 劳埃德利用被揭穿了的假货  诬蔑我国“剥夺西藏自治”

    劳埃德利用被揭穿了的假货
    诬蔑我国“剥夺西藏自治”
    新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德昨天又一次在英国下院谈论纯属中国内政的西藏问题。他毫无根据地诬蔑中国政府“剥夺西藏自治”。
    有议员要劳埃德就西藏局势发表声明，劳埃德在答复时首先引用了4月18日由印度外交官员在提斯浦尔散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中说的“事实上，在中国军队占领西藏以后，西藏政府没有享受任何程度的自治，甚至在内部问题上也是这样，而中国政府对西藏的事务行使全权。”这段话作为根据来诽谤中国。他说：“女王政府一直认为应当把西藏看成是自治区，因此，对于中国政府所采取的任何剥夺西藏自治的行动，我们都表示遗憾。”
    劳埃德避免触及英帝国主义所谓的“自治”就是分割别国领土的代名词。他也不敢答复中国舆论谴责英帝国主义过去就是在所谓“西藏自治”的幌子下，割裂中国的领土西藏的侵略行为。
    当劳埃德妄谈什么西藏实行区域自治时，却忘记了根本的一点，就是：不论西藏的情况如何，都是中国的内政，不容英国政府干涉，英国侵略和操纵西藏的时代已经一去不复返了。
