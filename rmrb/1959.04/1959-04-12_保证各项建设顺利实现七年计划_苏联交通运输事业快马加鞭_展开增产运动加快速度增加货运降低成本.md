　　To Ensure the Smooth Realization of Various Construction Projects in the Seven-Year Plan
　　The Soviet Transportation Industry is Moving at Full Speed
　　Launching a Production Increase Campaign to Accelerate Speed, Increase Freight Volume, and Reduce Costs
    Our Moscow dispatch on the 11th: At present, as the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan has begun to be successfully implemented and various sectors of the national economy are developing rapidly, all sectors of the Soviet transportation industry have launched a vigorous mass movement to ensure the smooth progress of construction projects. Their slogan is: accelerate transportation speed, increase freight volume, and reduce transportation costs.
    The transportation industry, like other economic sectors, will also experience tremendous development this year. This year alone, more than 1,900 kilometers of new railways will be built, of which more than 1,200 kilometers will be entirely new routes connecting new industrial areas. In addition, more than 1,900 kilometers of railways will be electrified. The largest of the new railways is the Siberian railway from Abakan to Tayshet, which is more than 700 kilometers long. After the completion of this railway, the abundant coal and iron resources of this area will be transported to the Kazakh Republic and Central Asia via the shortest route. In order to better mobilize vehicles and increase transportation speed, automatic adjusters and television equipment will also be installed on approximately 20,000 kilometers of railway lines this year.
    Regarding improving transportation efficiency, Soviet railway workers last year worked with local National Economic Councils to find ways to maximize the use of local materials or materials from nearby sources, reducing unnecessary long-distance transportation or shortening transportation routes. In 1958, due to the implementation of this principle, the average length of railway freight transportation was shortened by 13 kilometers nationwide, saving the country hundreds of millions of rubles. This work will continue to develop this year. The goal now put forward by Soviet railway workers is to shorten it by another ten kilometers. The main method to achieve this goal is to further strengthen the planning of transportation and better utilize the potential of automobile transportation and inland river navigation.
    According to the plan, this year's freight volume will increase by 60 to 65 billion ton-kilometers compared to last year. If converted into railcars, the daily transportation volume should increase by 11,000 railcars compared to last year. However, Soviet railway workers, with their high enthusiasm for labor, are striving to overfulfill this target under the encouragement of the Seven-Year Plan. In the first two months of this year alone, Soviet railway workers transported 900,000 railcars of goods above the plan. Komakov, a dispatcher on the Kuibyshev railway line, also invented a new method for quickly dispatching oil tankers. The implementation of this method has greatly increased the transportation speed of freight in the petroleum industry.

### 保证各项建设顺利实现七年计划　苏联交通运输事业快马加鞭　展开增产运动加快速度增加货运降低成本

　　保证各项建设顺利实现七年计划
　　苏联交通运输事业快马加鞭
　　展开增产运动加快速度增加货运降低成本
    本报莫斯科11日电　目前，当苏联七年计划已经胜利开始实现，国民经济各部门都在飞跃发展的时候，苏联交通运输业各部门为了保证建设事业的顺利进行，展开了一项热烈的群众运动。它们提出的口号是：加快运输速度，增加货运数量，降低运输成本。
    交通运输业在今年也像其他经济部门一样，将有巨大的发展。仅今年一年就将建成一千九百多公里新铁路，其中有一千二百多公里完全是联系新工业区的新路线。除此以外，还将有一千九百多公里的铁路实现电气化。在新建的铁路中最大的一条是西伯利亚的从阿巴根到泰谢特的铁路。它的全长达七百多公里。这条铁路建成后，将使这个地方丰富的煤铁资源从最短的线路运往哈萨克共和国和中亚各地。为了更好地调动车辆，提高运输速度，今年还将在二万公里左右的铁路线上安装自动化调整器和电视设备。
    在提高运输效率方面苏联的铁路工人在去年就与各地国民经济委员会一起想办法，尽量发挥就地取材或近处取材的精神，减少不必要的远程运输或缩短运输路线。在1958年，由于实行了这一原则，铁路货运的平均长度在全国缩短了十三公里，为国家节省了数亿卢布。今年，这一工作还将继续发展。现在苏联铁路工人提出的奋斗目标是再缩短十公里。达到这项目标的主要方法是进一步加强运输的计划性，更好地发挥汽车运输与内河航运的潜力。
    按照计划，今年的货运量将比去年增加六百到六百五十亿吨公里。如果折合成车皮，那末每昼夜应比去年增加一万一千车皮的运输量。但是，劳动热情高涨的苏联铁路工人在七年计划的鼓舞下还在争取超额完成这项指标。仅今年前两个月，苏联铁路工人就超计划运输了九十万车皮货物。古比雪夫铁路线调度员科马科夫还发明了一种快速调度油车的新方法。由于这一方法的实行，大大提高了石油工业货运的运输速度。
