Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 29th: The Bucharest newspapers published on the 28th the resolution of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers on strengthening the Party's leadership and supervision of state farms, as well as several measures to improve the economic work of state farms.

In the resolution, the Party and the government require state farms to produce large quantities of grain and livestock products with minimal expenditure and increased labor productivity. State farms should ensure the continued growth of grain production and strive to become the center of the country's agricultural product reserves.

The resolution pointed out that in order to accomplish this extremely important task, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's overall leadership and supervision over the work of state farms, while continuously improving the leadership of the business management of state farms, and strengthening the sense of responsibility of farm managers and other leading cadres. To this end, the Party and the government decided to establish a council in the state farms, composed of the farm manager, the person in charge of the Party, leading cadres at all levels of the farm, and the heads of the trade union and the Labor Youth League.

    加强党对国营农场领导
    新华社布加勒斯特29日电　首都各报28日刊登了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会和部长会议关于加强国营农场的党的领导和监督，以及改善国营农场经济工作的若干措施的决议。
    在决议中，党和政府要求国营农场以最少的开支和提高劳动生产率的办法来生产大量的粮食和畜产品。国营农场应当保证粮食生产的继续增长，并尽量使其成为国家农产品储备的中心。
    决议指出，为了完成这个异常重要的任务，有必要加强党对国营农场的全盘工作的领导和监督作用，同时要不断改善国营农场的经营管理工作的领导，并加强场长和其他领导干部的责任心。为此，党和政府决定，在国营农场中成立一个理事会，由场长、党的负责人、农场各级领导干部和工会、劳动青年联盟的负责人组成。
