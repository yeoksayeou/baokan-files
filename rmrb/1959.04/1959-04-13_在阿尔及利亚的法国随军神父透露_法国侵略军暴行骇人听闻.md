Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 12th – Algiers Dispatch: Thirty-five French military chaplains stationed with the French invasion forces in Algeria recently revealed, in a letter to the French weekly "Catholic Witness," the numerous atrocities committed by the French army in Algeria.

The letter stated that in Algeria there have been many "arbitrary arrests and detentions," and that "interrogations are often conducted in a manner that we can only call torture."

The letter revealed that the immediate execution of civilians and prisoners of war decided by "illegitimate authorities" "is not an isolated incident," and that people are often executed for being falsely accused of trying to escape. Official news often does not report such matters.

The letter also stated that "killing the wounded in battle is also a common occurrence."

　　在阿尔及利亚的法国随军神父透露
　　法国侵略军暴行骇人听闻
    新华社12日讯　阿尔及尔消息：驻在阿尔及利亚的法国侵略军中的三十五名法国随军神父最近在写给法国“天主教证言报”周刊的信中，透露了法军在阿尔及利亚干出的累累暴行。
    这封信说，在阿尔及利亚曾经发生了许许多多“任意逮捕和拘留人的事件”，“审讯常常是用我们只能称为虐待的方式进行的”。
    信中透露，由“不合法的当局”决定立即处死平民和战俘的事情“并不是个别的”，人们常常由于被人捏造说要逃跑而被处死。而官方消息则往往不报道这种事情。
    这封信还说，“在战斗中杀死伤兵也是常事”。
