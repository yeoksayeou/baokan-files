Visiting Several Factories in Hangzhou
Chen Shaomin

In late March, I visited several factories in Hangzhou and listened to comrades introducing the production situation there. After the Great Leap Forward last year, the economic outlook of Hangzhou has changed greatly.

I visited Hangzhou in May 1952. At that time, the industrial base there was still very poor. There was no heavy industry; light industrial factories were small and scattered. There were only a few factories with more than five hundred people, and thousands of small factories with a few people or dozens of people. The technology was backward, the machinery and equipment were outdated, and most of the operations were manual. In just seven years, Hangzhou in the Great Leap Forward has built heavy industrial factories such as steel and machinery, and can manufacture its own mechanical equipment. Many large factories have been newly built and expanded. Factories with five or six hundred people are called "small factories" by them. Manual operations have been changed to automation. The Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, famous for its brocade weaving, had only ninety people and thirty hand-pulled wooden machines in 1952. Now it has developed into a large factory with nearly two thousand people and more than four hundred and twenty electric motors, with an output value increased by more than eighty times. I visited the Huafeng Paper Mill, which is an old factory with relatively outdated equipment. Before the Great Leap Forward last year, there were only more than 1,300 people. Now it has developed into a factory with more than 3,000 people and diversified operations. They built blast furnaces, converters, and foundries from scratch through self-reliance, manufactured indigenous machine tools and blowers, built new rayon workshops, and also established twenty-five key factories to produce products such as cement, coke, and sulfuric acid, and successfully trial-produced more than fifty new products. Hangzhou's industrial production has greatly developed, and the material and cultural life of workers has also improved accordingly. There are many more spare-time schools, nurseries, canteens, and dormitories... I felt that this was not like visiting a factory, but like seeing a fascinating picture. The famous scenic spot of Hangzhou appears even more beautiful.

The rapid industrial development in Hangzhou proves the correctness of the Party's leadership and the correctness of the mass line working method. Under the cultivation of the Party, the level of consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly improved. In order to accelerate socialist construction, they have launched a vigorous technical revolution under the leadership of the Party and overcome various difficulties. Zhejiang is short of coal, so hardworking Hangzhou workers dig mud from West Lake to burn boilers as fuel. With the spirit of continuous revolution, they broke through all kinds of obstacles of conservative thinking and solved the new problems that emerged in the Great Leap Forward.

The Huafeng Paper Mill's ability to make a Great Leap Forward was due to continuous revolutionary struggles. When the leap forward plan was formulated last year, conservatives came out to discourage it. When the leadership handed the plan over to the masses for discussion, and a leap forward target of doubling the output value was set, the onlookers and head-shakers said: This is talking about the "Investiture of the Gods." In order to increase production, the workers demanded to speed up the machine, but the onlookers said again: Increasing the speed is destined to fail. The factory leadership supported the workers' initiative and organized six or seven groups of people to go to advanced factories in Northeast China, Tianjin, Shanghai and other places to "seek experience and treasure." After the workers worked hard, worked diligently, and worked skillfully, they carried out technical innovation, increasing the machine speed from 115 meters per minute to 180 meters per minute. However, insufficient drying capacity became a problem. The workers were not intimidated by the difficulties. With the spirit of "If there is one point of difficulty, use ten points of brainpower," they added charcoal fire to dry the paper, solving the drying problem. The paperboard workshop caught fire due to negligence in the work, burning down the factory building. At this time, the onlookers sarcastically said: "The factory building is burned down, how can you still have a leap forward!" But the papermakers did not lose heart. They spent six days building a new factory building and quickly resumed production. As production increased, the pulp supply could not keep up. The pulp section increased from seventy-six people to one hundred and fifty-nine people, and the work was still very tiring. They learned from the experience of advanced factories and made their own pulp conveying machines; without steel, they used wood to make them, implemented continuous pulping and mechanized pulp conveying methods, changed the production process, greatly reduced labor intensity, and saved manpower. The entire section was reduced from one hundred and fifty-nine people to eighty-four people. The number of people has decreased, but the work is easier than before. After the completion of the last innovation project, this section can be reduced to sixty people. The factory workers also improved the equipment with a revolutionary spirit, and through self-reliance, manufactured eight papermaking equipment, overcame the difficulties of raw materials, manufactured high-grade paper, and comprehensively overfulfilled the leap forward plan.

During the Great Leap Forward, factories in Hangzhou, like the Huafeng Paper Mill, created rich experiences. According to the spirit of the provincial and municipal Party committees' industrial conferences, the Party committees of various factories organized political, industrial, and Youth League cadres and workers to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and formulate the leap forward plan for 1959. The workers were very enthusiastic and demanded to continue the Great Leap Forward. The plans formulated after mass discussions were all larger than the national plans. For example, the original plan of the Huafeng Paper Mill was already much larger than the actual completed figure last year, but the masses were not satisfied. The plan formulated after discussion was 54,000 tons. This figure is larger than the national plan and doubled the actual output completed last year. The workers are most familiar with production and know their own production capacity best. The plans they formulated are in line with the actual situation. They say where to go and do it where they say. Many factories reported good news with gongs and drums and completed the first quarter plan ahead of schedule. Red flags were fluttering by the West Lake, creating a lively atmosphere.

The Party, government, trade union, and Youth League cadres and the broad masses of workers in various factories in Hangzhou have done a lot of work to strive to complete the first quarter plan ahead of schedule and ensure the over-fulfillment of the 1959 leap forward plan. The leadership actively implemented the Party's mass line, "one delivery," "two participations," "three combinations," "four bigs," and "five inspections," summarized and promoted advanced experiences, launched mass movements on a large scale, and made a big technical revolution, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. The masses demanded to quickly set off a new upsurge in production. According to the instructions of the Party committee, the trade union cooperated with the administration to mobilize the masses to widely carry out top-down, leadership-mass combination, in-depth and meticulous socialist labor competitions. They created a variety of lively competition experiences that combined "horizontal and vertical" aspects, such as "operation selection competitions," "skill contests," "individual vs. individual," "collective vs. collective," and "one-dragon" competitions organized according to the upper and lower procedures of varieties. The workers in the wide-width cloth workshop of the Hangzhou Cotton Textile Factory launched an operation selection competition and a skill contest. During the skill contest, the workers themselves elected commanders, judges (experienced veteran technicians), supervisors, inspectors, propagandists... The masses, leading cadres, and technicians jointly took responsibility for evaluating advanced workers and summarizing experiences. The masses were visitors, judges, experience summarizers, and learners of advanced experience. More and more people learned from and caught up with advanced workers. More than 90% of the workers set plans to catch up with the skilled workers. After the "skill contest" was launched in mid-January this year, the workshop could complete the plan on a daily basis, and overfulfilled the monthly plan for the first time in January, ensuring the successful completion of the first quarter plan. Experience has proven that as long as we follow the mass line and fully mobilize the masses, we can overcome all difficulties and achieve a Great Leap Forward.

The spring of West Lake is beautiful, and the spring on the industrial front in Hangzhou is even more moving!

　　看了杭州的几个工厂
　　陈少敏
    3月下旬，我到杭州看了几个工厂，听同志们介绍了那里的生产情况。经过去年的大跃进，杭州的经济面貌大大地改变了。
    1952年5月我到过杭州。那时候，那里的工业基础还很差。没有重工业；轻工业工厂小而分散。五百人以上的厂只有几个，几个人、几十个人的小厂有几千个。技术落后，机械设备陈旧，大部分是手工操作。时间仅七年，大跃进中的杭州已经建设起钢铁、机械等重工业工厂，自己能制造机械设备了。新建和扩建了许多大工厂，五、六百人的工厂，他们叫“小厂子”。手工操作的改成自动化了。以织锦闻名的都锦生丝织厂，1952年只有九十人，三十台手拉木机，现在发展成为有将近二千人、四百二十多台电动机的大厂了，产值增长了八十多倍。我参观了华丰造纸厂，这是个设备比较陈旧的老厂，在去年大跃进以前只有一千三百多人，现在已经发展成为三千多人、多种经营的工厂了。他们从无到有，自力更生，兴建了高炉、转炉、铸工场，制造了土洋结合机床、鼓风机，新建了人造丝车间，还办了二十五个重点工厂，生产水泥、焦炭、硫酸等产品，试制成功了五十多种新产品。杭州市的工业生产大大发展了，职工的物质文化生活也随着改善了。业余学校、托儿所、食堂、宿舍增加了很多……。我感到这不像看工厂，而是像看到了一幅引人入神的图画。著名的风景区杭州，显得更加美丽了。
    杭州的工业发展得这样快，证明了党领导的正确、群众路线工作方法的正确。广大职工群众在党的培育下，觉悟水平大大提高了，他们为加速社会主义建设，在党的领导下，大闹技术革命，克服了种种困难。浙江缺煤，勤劳的杭州工人，就挖西湖里的泥巴当燃料烧锅炉。他们以不断革命的精神，冲破保守思想的种种阻挠，解决了大跃进中出现的新问题。
    华丰造纸厂能够大跃进是进行了不断革命斗争。去年订跃进计划时，保守主义者出来促退。当领导把计划交群众讨论，定出产值翻一番的跃进指标以后，观潮派、摇头派说：这是在讲“封神榜”。职工们为了提高产量，要求加快车速，观潮派们又说：提高车速注定要失败。厂的领导支持了群众的倡议，组织了六、七批人员，分赴东北、天津、上海等地先进厂“求经取宝”。经过职工们实干、苦干、巧干，进行了技术革新，使车速由每分钟一百一十五公尺，逐步提高到一百八十公尺。可是烘干能力不足又成了问题。职工们没有被困难吓倒，他们以“困难有一分，脑筋动十分”的精神，加炭火烘，解决了烘干的问题。纸版车间由于工作中的疏忽，失了火，把厂房烧了。这时观潮派又讽刺说：“厂房都烧了，还跃进么！”但是造纸工人们并没有泄气，他们花了六天功夫，盖起了新的厂房，迅速恢复了生产。产量增加了，纸浆又供不上。纸浆工段由七十六人增加到一百五十九人，工作仍然很累，他们就学习先进厂的经验，自己制造输浆机；没有钢铁，就用木头做，实行了连续打浆和机械化输浆法，改变了生产过程，大大减轻了劳动强度，节省了人力。全工段由一百五十九人减到八十四人。人减少了，工作反比以前轻松了。待最后一个革新项目完成以后，这个工段可减少到六十人。该厂职工又以革命精神，改进了设备，自力更生制造了八台造纸设备，克服了原材料困难，制造出了高级纸张，全面超额完成了跃进计划。
    在大跃进中杭州各工厂和华丰造纸厂一样，创造了丰富的经验。各厂党委根据省、市委工业会议精神，组织政、工、团干部和职工群众总结了1958年大跃进经验，订出了1959年的跃进计划。职工群众干劲很大，他们要求继续大跃进。经过群众讨论订出的计划都比国家计划大。如华丰造纸厂，原订的计划已经比去年实际完成的数字大得多，但群众不满足，讨论以后订出的计划是五万四千吨。这个数字比国家计划大，比去年实际完成的产量翻了一番。职工群众最熟悉生产，最了解自己的生产能力，他们订的计划是合乎实际情况的，他们说到哪，做到哪。许多厂都敲锣打鼓报捷，提前完成了第一季度计划。西子湖畔红旗招展，一片热闹气氛。
    杭州各厂的党、政、工、团干部和广大职工群众，为争取提前完成第一季度计划，保证超额完成1959年跃进计划，做了很多工作。领导上积极贯彻执行党的群众路线，“一交”“两参”“三结合”“四大”“五检查”，总结推广先进经验，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，充分发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性。群众要求迅速掀起新的生产高潮，工会按照党委指示，配合行政，发动群众广泛开展自下而上的、领导与群众相结合的、深入细致的社会主义劳动竞赛。创造了“操作选拔赛”“能手比武”“个人与个人”、“集体与集体”以及按品种上下工序组织起来的“一条龙”竞赛等等“条条块块”相结合的、多种多样的、生动活泼的竞赛经验。杭州棉纺织厂宽幅布车间职工开展了操作选拔赛，能手比武竞赛。在能手比武时，工人自己选出了指挥员、评判员（有经验的老技工）、监督员、检查员、宣传鼓动员，还有记者……。群众和领导干部、技术人员共同负责，评定先进，总结经验。群众是参观者、评判者、经验总结者，又是先进经验的学习者。学先进、赶先进的人越来越多。90％以上的工人订了赶上能手的规划。这个车间今年1月中旬开展“能手比武”以后，就能按日完成计划，1月份第一次超额完成月计划，保证了第一季度计划的胜利完成。经验证明：只要走群众路线，充分发动群众，就能克服一切困难，就能大跃进。
    西湖的春天是美丽的，杭州的工业战线上的春天更是动人！
