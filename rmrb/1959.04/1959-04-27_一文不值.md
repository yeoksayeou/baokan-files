    Worthless
    Qian Xin
    Regarding the Tibet issue, the US imperialism is currently adopting what is said to be a "strategic silence policy."

    The "silence" being called "strategic" inevitably reminds one of an Eastern proverb: The tiger crouches down, but not out of kindness.

    United Press International revealed that the reason the United States wants to maintain "strategic silence" is based on the assumption that: one word spoken by people from non-aligned Asian countries is more valuable than thousands upon thousands of anti-communist words spoken by the US government.

    Is one word really more valuable than thousands upon thousands of words? That depends on what word it is. If it is the voice of truth and justice, then one word is of course greater than thousands of anti-communist slanders. If it is lies and smears, the trite clichés of imperialism (such as "independent Tibet"), then no matter who says it, whether it is one word or a million words, in the eyes of the people, it is actually worthless.

    Everyone knows that Tibet has a total population of only 1.2 million, and the rebellion was participated in by only a small number of reactionary elements. A "late newspaper" in Cairo described the rebellion of this small number of people as "a revolution of three million people against Chinese rule." Another newspaper, "Today's News," had even more fertile imagination, and actually said that the reason for the rebellion was that "the Chinese Communist government forced the implementation of a communist system in family life in Tibet," and that this "communist system in family life" was supposedly "husbands will not have fixed wives, and no one will have a fixed son."

    Those who say these things are also considered "people from non-aligned countries," and they have said far more than just one word. But what value is there in spreading such rumors and slanders that are below common sense, even if you said them on several trains?

    一文不值

    关于西藏问题，目前美帝国主义采取的据说是“战略性的沉默政策”。
    “沉默”而有所谓“战略性的”，这就不免叫人想起东方的一句谚语：老虎蹲下来决不是发慈悲。
    合众国际社透露，美国所以要保持“战略性的沉默”，是根据这样的设想：亚洲非集团国家的人说的一个字要比美国政府说成千上万个反共字眼还要有价值。
    一个字当真比成千上万个字的价值大？这要看是什么字。如果是真理和正义的声音，一个字当然大过千言万语的反共谰言。如果是说谎和诬蔑，是帝国主义的陈腔滥调（例如“西藏独立国”之类），那么不管出自谁人之口，不管是一个字还是一百万字，在人民的眼中，其实都是一文不值的。
    谁都知道，西藏总共只有一百二十万人口，参加叛乱的不过是一小撮反动分子。开罗的一家“晚报”却把这一小撮人的叛乱说成“三百万人反对中国统治的革命”。另一家“今日消息报”的想像力更丰富了，竟说什么叛乱的原因是“中国共产党政府在西藏强迫在家庭生活中实行共产主义制度”，而这种“家庭生活中的共产主义制度”据说是“丈夫将没有固定的妻子，谁也没有固定的儿子”。
    说这些话的也算是“非集团国家的人”，而且远远不止说了一个字。但是像这种常识以下的造谣和诬蔑，就是说上几火车，又有什么价值之可言呢？
