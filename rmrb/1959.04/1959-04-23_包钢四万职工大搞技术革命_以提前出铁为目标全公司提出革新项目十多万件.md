Baotou, April 22nd (This newspaper dispatch) — The technical revolution and technical innovation movement launched by Baotou Iron and Steel Company, aimed at fully implementing the general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and with the current goal of achieving early iron production, has reached a climax.

According to incomplete statistics, approximately 40,000 employees, more than half of the total workforce, are directly involved in this movement. Since the beginning of the year, employees have proposed over 100,000 technical innovation projects, about 15% of which have already been implemented. These innovations have begun to demonstrate their power in accelerating construction progress, ensuring quality, saving manpower and materials, and improving labor productivity. In the first quarter, despite shortages of materials and equipment, construction units directly related to iron production, such as the iron mine, steel plant, coking plant, electromechanical installation company, and pipeline company, all overfulfilled their quarterly plans.

The technical revolution and technical innovation movement at Baotou Steel has now entered a stage of clear goals, close integration with production and construction, and comprehensive blooming.

In terms of construction, the movement is centered around key projects and key issues for early iron production. The Second Team of the Metal Structure Company, which previously set new records for high-quality and rapid installation during the installation of blast furnaces and hot blast stoves, has recently set three new records for rapid installation, becoming a model of hard work combined with ingenuity. This team, through production technology meetings involving leaders, workers, and technicians in a "three-way combination," mobilized the masses to identify key issues and propose suggestions. Relying on more than ten skilled veteran workers, they installed a 15-ton capacity, over 60-meter high tower crane in four days; installed two 39-meter high gas scrubbing towers in just over three days; and completed the installation of three 21-meter high electric dust collector shells in only 24 hours. The coking plant, which is about to go into production, has implemented over 1,000 technical innovation proposals since holding a technical revolution mobilization meeting in early March. To save time before the arrival of some equipment, employees have independently manufactured various machines and tools, such as coal charging cars and copper tools for production. Electromechanical installation workers constructing the coking plant, when installing a large blower with high precision, the deputy captain Man Shi'an, a veteran worker, cooperated with technicians and workers to develop a method of "positioning all three major components together and leveling them simultaneously," shortening the installation period by five days.

The technical innovation movement has opened up a new avenue for solving the urgent need for auxiliary materials and equipment. The electromechanical installation company undertakes most of the installation tasks for key projects, which are technically complex, and there are insufficient machines and tools. In response to this situation, employees have independently established six small processing factories in recent months, manufacturing 150 pieces of indigenous and foreign-made machinery, increasing the efficiency of some types of work by one to dozens of times. The metal structure company's fabrication plant is responsible for the production of large steel pipes for water pipelines, and the project requires urgent completion, but the plant lacks hoisting and transportation equipment. Employees took the initiative to add three electric trolley lines, three railway switches, and improved key equipment such as edge planers, more than doubling output in March. In the first quarter, small factories born from the technical innovation movement in various units produced more than 800 tons of cement and more than 50 tons of welding rods and calcium carbide.

The Baotou Steel Design Institute and the Baotou Metallurgical Science Experiment Institute not only closely served production and construction in the movement, but also conquered some cutting-edge technological strongholds. The Design Institute, by implementing the combination of design with construction and production, and the combination of leaders and technicians with workers, went out of the design building to design and solve problems on-site. In the first quarter, they implemented over 1,600 technical innovation projects, rationally modified some engineering designs, and could save 3,600 tons of steel and more than 2.5 million yuan in investment. The construction designs for the large blooming mill and the largest water tower in China, which they previously considered too technically complex to design, have also been successfully designed. The Metallurgical Science Experiment Institute, in the initial stage of construction with incomplete personnel and equipment, not only accepted tens of thousands of chemical analysis and testing projects, actively preparing for Baotou Steel's production, but also created a series of rapid analysis methods.

From the second quarter onwards, Baotou Steel's various factories and mines have listed technical revolution and technical innovation as the central content of the red banner competition. The head office has established a Science and Technology Work Committee to lead the technical revolution movement; grassroots units have also strengthened their leadership over this movement to ensure its healthier development.

### 包钢四万职工大搞技术革命  以提前出铁为目标全公司提出革新项目十多万件

    包钢四万职工大搞技术革命
    以提前出铁为目标全公司提出革新项目十多万件
    本报包头22日电　包头钢铁公司开展的以全面贯彻多快好省方针、以提前出铁为当前目标的技术革命和技术革新运动，已经形成高潮。
    据不完全统计，目前直接投入这一运动的职工约四万人占职工总数一半以上。从年初到现在，职工们提出的技术革新项目已达十多万件，15％左右已经实现，在加快建设进度、保证质量、节约人力物力和提高劳动生产率方面，都开始显示了威力。第一季度，在材料、设备赶不上需要的情况下，铁矿山、炼铁厂、焦化厂、机电安装公司、管道公司等与出铁直接有关的施工单位，都超额完成了季度计划。
    包钢的技术革命和技术革新运动，目前已进入了目标明确、密切结合生产建设和全面开花的阶段。
    在施工方面，运动是围绕着早出铁的关键工程和关键问题展开的。在高炉和热风炉本体安装过程中，曾经创造优质快速安装新纪录的金属结构公司第二队，最近又创造了三项快速安装新纪录，成为苦干加巧干的一面红旗。这个队通过领导干部、工人群众和技术人员“三结合”的生产技术会议，发动群众找关键、提建议，依靠十多名技术精湛的老工人，四天安装起了一台起重能力十五吨、高六十多公尺的塔式吊车；三天多时间安装了两座高三十九公尺的煤气注涤塔；三座高二十一公尺的电力除尘器外壳，安装时间只用了二十四小时。即将投入生产的焦化厂，3月初举行技术革命誓师大会以后，已实现了技术革新建议一千多件，职工们在部分设备未到前，为争取时间，自制了装煤车和生产用的铜工具等多种机具。在焦化厂施工的机电安装工人，安装一台精密度很高的大鼓风机的时候，老工人出身的副队长满世安和技术员、工人合作，研究出鼓风机三大件“一起就位、同时找平”的方法，使安装工期提前了五天。
    技术革新运动，为解决急需的辅助性材料设备开辟了一条新的途径。机电安装公司担任着各重点工程大部分安装任务，技术复杂，机械和工具不够用。他们针对这个情况，几个月来，职工群众自办起六个小加工厂，自制土洋结合的机械一百五十台，使部分工种提高效率一倍到几十倍。金属结构公司制作厂担任了输水管线大型钢管制作任务，工程需要紧迫，厂内吊装运输设备不足。职工们就自己动手，增设了三条电动走线滑子，三股铁路道岔，改进了刨边机等关键设备，在3月份使产量翻了一番多。第一季度各单位由技术革新运动中诞生的小工厂，生产了水泥八百多吨，电焊条和电石五十多吨。
    包钢设计院和包钢冶金科学试验所，在运动中不仅密切地为生产建设服务，还攻克了一些尖端技术堡垒。设计院由于贯彻了设计与施工和生产结合，领导和技术人员与工人群众结合，走出设计楼，到现场设计和解决问题，一季度就实现了技术革新项目一千六百多件，合理修改了部分工程设计，可以节约钢材三千六百吨，节省投资二百五十多万元。他们过去认为技术太复杂，不敢设计的大型初轧机和国内最大的水塔等的施工设计，也都设计成功了。冶金科学试验所在人员不齐，设备不全的初建阶段，不仅接受了数万个化学分析和试验项目，积极为包钢生产作准备，同时创造了一系列快速分析方法。
    从第二季度起，包钢各厂矿单位已把技术革命和技术革新列为红旗竞赛的中心内容。总公司已成立了科学技术工作委员会，负责领导技术革命运动；各基层单位也加强了对这一运动的领导，以保证运动更健康地向前发展。
