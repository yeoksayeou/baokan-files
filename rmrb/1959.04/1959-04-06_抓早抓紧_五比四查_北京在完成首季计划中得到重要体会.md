    Seize the Day and Press Ahead: "Five Comparisons and Four Checks"
    Beijing Gains Important Experience in Completing First Quarter Plans
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Lei Runming reports: In overfulfilling the first quarter industrial production plan, the capital's workers deeply realized that seizing the day and pressing ahead, resolutely implementing the thought of "the whole nation as a single chessboard," and vigorously carrying out appraisal and competition are important guarantees for organizing production leaps forward and completing the national plan ahead of schedule.
    According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics: The total industrial output value completed in the city in the first quarter exceeded the plan by 7.5%, an increase of 167.9% compared with the same period last year. In terms of the output of major products, steel, steel products, pig iron, raw coal, cement, hoists, mine cars, water pumps, switchboards, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, wool fabrics, etc., all exceeded the plan.
    The early and tight grasp by relevant departments and factories and mines is an important reason for the overfulfillment of Beijing's first quarter industrial production plan. Starting at the end of last year, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee launched the city's workers to study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, establishing the idea of a greater leap forward. The city's workers held heated discussions on this year's national plan, and many factories and mines not only formulated their own unit's leap forward plan, but also formulated specific measures for workshops, groups, and individuals to leap forward and complete the plan, achieving advanced plans and specific measures. Therefore, it ensured that the city completed the plan every month in the first quarter; except for early March, all other ten-day periods within the three months were completed on schedule and ahead of schedule.
    After the enthusiasm of the masses was aroused, the Party organizations at all levels in Beijing, based on the Party's policy of "the whole nation as a single chessboard," carried out a series of ideological education and organizational work. In each industry, according to the principle of taking steel as the key link, ensuring key points, and driving the general, the allocation of raw materials, labor, machinery and equipment, and transportation capacity was planned in a unified way, ensuring the scheduled completion of the city's steel, steel products, pig iron, and other key products plans.
    In order to fully tap the potential of existing equipment and realize a more comprehensive leap forward, workers in factories and mines throughout the city also launched a "five comparisons and four checks" campaign in the first quarter, comparing efficiency, variety, quality, cost, and safety, and checking consumption quotas, warehouses, semi-finished products, and personnel quotas. As a result of this campaign, many factories set off a wave of learning from and catching up with advanced units, further unleashing the potential of enterprises. Under the circumstances of monthly increases in coal production, the Jingxi Coal Mine carried out the "five comparisons and four checks" campaign, resulting in a 12.9% reduction in the cost per ton of coal in the first quarter compared to the plan, and a 26.6% reduction compared to last year.
    Although Beijing's industrial production achieved great results in the first quarter, the development of various factories and mines is unbalanced. Some factories have not yet completed their production plans, and the plans for some products have not been completed well enough. The production task for the second quarter is even greater and more arduous, and it is the key quarter to complete the annual plan. Now, the city's workers are using the experience gained in the first quarter to seize the production of the second quarter earlier and more tightly, concentrating more power, and further launching a red flag competition movement for high production, high quality, and high efficiency, establishing advanced "pacesetters," making great efforts in technological revolution, and organizing appraisals according to the requirements of "three highs". The Municipal Party Committee also requires relevant departments and factories and mines to strengthen specific leadership over the competition, and the workshops and groups of each factory and mine should draw up a product schedule for the workshop and a daily schedule for major products, and around these schedules, draw up a schedule for supporting products and a schedule for the realization of important measures, and check the progress of product production and the realization of measures by ten-day periods and by day.

### 抓早抓紧　五比四查  北京在完成首季计划中得到重要体会

    抓早抓紧　五比四查
    北京在完成首季计划中得到重要体会
    本报讯　记者雷润明报道：首都工人在超额完成第一季度工业生产计划中，深切地体会到抓得早、抓得紧，坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的思想，大搞评比竞赛，是组织生产跃进，提前完成国家计划的重要保证。
    据北京市统计局统计：全市第一季度完成的工业总产值超过计划7.5％，比去年同期增长167.9％。在主要产品的产量方面，钢、钢材、生铁、原煤、水泥、卷扬机、矿车、水泵、开关板、棉布、棉纱、毛织品等，都超额完成了计划。
    有关部门和厂矿企业抓得早抓得紧，是北京市首季工业生产计划超额完成的重要原因。从去年底开始，中共北京市委就发动全市职工学习党的八届六中全会文件，树立了更大跃进的思想。全市职工对今年的国家计划进行了热烈讨论，很多厂矿企业不但订出了本单位的跃进计划，还订出了车间、小组和个人的跃进计划和完成计划的具体措施，做到了计划先进，措施具体。因此保证了全市在第一季度里月月完成计划；三个月内除3月上旬外，其他各旬都如期和超额完成了计划。
    在群众的干劲鼓舞起来以后，北京市的各级党组织根据党的“全国一盘棋”的方针，曾进行了一系列的思想教育工作和组织工作。在各个行业中都根据以钢为纲、保证重点带动一般的原则，对原材料、劳动力、机械设备以及运输力量等进行了统筹安排，保证了全市钢、钢材、生铁和其他一些重点产品计划的如期完成。
    为了充分挖掘现有设备潜力，实现更全面的跃进，全市厂矿企业职工在第一季度里还开展了比效率、比品种、比质量、比成本、比安全和查消耗定额、查仓库、查半成品、查人员定额的“五比四查”运动。这一运动开展的结果，很多工厂掀起了学先进、赶先进的热潮，使企业的潜力得到进一步发挥。京西煤矿在煤产量月月提高的情况下，开展“五比四查”的结果，第一季度每吨煤的成本比计划降低12.9％，比去年降低了26.6％。
    第一季度北京的工业生产虽然有很大成绩，但各厂矿的发展状况是不平衡的，一部分工厂还没有完成生产计划，有些产品的计划还完成得不够好。第二季度的生产任务更大更艰巨，是完成全年计划的关键季度。现在全市职工正在运用第一季度所取得的经验，使第二季度生产抓得更早，抓得更紧，力量更加集中，同时进一步开展高产高质高效率的红旗竞赛运动，树立先进“标兵”，大闹技术革命，按照“三高”的要求，组织评比。市委还要求各有关部和厂矿企业加强对竞赛的具体领导，各厂矿车间和小组要排出车间产品进度表和主要产品的日进度表，并围绕着这些进度表排出配套产品进度表，重要措施实现的进度表，按旬按日检查产品生产进度和措施实现情况。
