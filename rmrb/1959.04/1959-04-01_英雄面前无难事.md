Nothing is Difficult Before Heroes
By our reporter Shi Yue'e

The Xi River was frozen solid. There wasn't a single crack in the ice, only the water pump pipes of the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant in Liaoning Province were deeply inserted into its embrace, greedily sucking its withered milk, emitting hurried, rattling noises.

Inside the plant's return water pump room, a stream of clear water overflowed. At the mouths of the two return water pipes connected to the concentration tank, white foam splashed everywhere, rushing in like waterfalls, only to turn around and flow back through the pipes. Return water, supplemented by a small amount of clear water, flowed continuously throughout the plant, and all nineteen ore dressing systems in the plant turned along with it. Since February, the output of fine ore powder has been surging upward: 7,000 tons, 8,000 tons, 9,000 tons, 10,000 tons...

The Xi River is still the same Xi River, and the water source hasn't changed. But why was there frequent downtime waiting for water in January, while in February all the equipment was able to operate?

    The Threat of Drought

The entire production process of the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant involves working with water. With sufficient water, the machines can run and produce high-quality fine ore powder. The plant needs more than 5,000 tons of water per hour, and the only water source is a small, nameless river – the Xi River. As production leaped forward, the flow of the Xi River not only didn't increase, but since winter, the water volume had decreased, and the plant suffered a severe water shortage. Water! Water! Water! Everywhere there were cries for water. The Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant encountered a serious threat of drought on its path forward!

Production was intermittent, the machines started and stopped, and Yang Chunze, the leader of the first and second workshops' third shift, and the workers, couldn't remain calm, anxiously pacing in the workshop. After attending the old workers' symposium convened by the Party committee, Yang Chunze felt somewhat calmer. The meeting proposed a method to increase the ore discharge concentration. But would the ore discharge port become blocked after reducing the water and increasing the concentration? No one was sure.

Yang Chunze and other workers decided to formally test the operating methods of increasing the ore feed and discharge concentrations.

In late January, Yang Chunze and his shift workers came to the workshop in the cold morning wind. When they took over, only three systems in the first and second workshops were running, and six systems were stopped. After taking over, the workers took their positions, and the key water valves and critical water-using equipment were personally controlled by experienced workers. They slowly reduced the central water valve circle by circle, retreating from a maximum opening of a dozen circles to three circles. The ore feed concentration on the ball mill increased from 20% to 40%, and the ore discharge concentration of the dewatering trough and magnetic separator increased from 30% to 50%. They mastered the principle of "adjusting the water according to the amount of ore": when there was more ore, they slightly opened the valve, and when there was less ore, they closed the valve a little. In this way, the three systems operated continuously for four hours, and everything was normal. Not only was there no blockage, but the tailings loss was even lower than before.

"Run one more system!" As soon as Yang Chunze thought of this, he immediately climbed East Hill and looked into the reservoir. Good, the water level wasn't low! He happily returned to the workshop and said to the old worker Zhou Qingming, "Go and start the fourth system! But use the water sparingly!" Three hours later, the ball mills started to turn one by one. Near the end of the shift, seven of the workshop's nine systems were running, creating a new record of 331 tons of shift output, a fine ore powder iron content as high as 65.76%, and tailings of 10.93%. Seeing this achievement, Yang Chunze was extremely happy. But what about the third and fourth workshops? He hurriedly picked up the phone receiver to ask, and heard the voice of the shift leader Gao Junfeng on the other end:

"Normal!" The dialogue spread throughout his body through the current, and both of them simultaneously emitted light laughter.

How exactly were the third and fourth workshops operating normally? A few days ago, shift leader Gao Junfeng thought, Yang Chunze is trying high-concentration operation to save water, we also have to clean up the "water guzzlers". The "water guzzlers" refer to the most water-intensive dewatering troughs and magnetic separators. There are thirty of them in the whole workshop, each using more than three tons of water per hour. "Can we shut down one in each ball milling system?" On this day, while maintaining the grinding capacity, they shut down nearly ten dewatering troughs and magnetic separators, strictly controlling the use of water valves, cooperating with the plant's actions, and finally won the victory. Under the condition of unchanged water source, all nineteen systems in the plant were running.

    Continuous Circulation

The plant's production water—clear water and recycled water—is a complete system. Above and below ground, there are spiderweb-like water pipes everywhere. Especially the wastewater and impurities from the third and fourth workshops after repeated ore dressing flow into the concentration tank, which is fifty meters wide in diameter. After sedimentation, a large amount of water returns to the production process for application. The only drawback is that the first and second ore dressing systems don't have this equipment, and water loss is significant. Building a concentration tank not only involves a large amount of engineering, but also is a distant solution to an immediate problem. Therefore, the Party committee required maximizing the application of recycled water under the existing conditions. This call touched the hearts of the maintenance workers, and they immediately held a meeting to discuss and decided to first connect the two key pipelines of the first and second workshops.

Connecting the wastewater from the two-stage dewatering troughs of the second grinding system to the secondary classifier is only eight meters away, but because of the large water flow, iron pipes with a diameter of four inches are necessary. However, the material warehouse happened to be out of this type of pipe. At the group meeting, Liu Zhenqing, the maintenance team leader, raised this difficulty and asked everyone to come up with ideas. Geng Xicai, a worker, had just replaced a few thick pipes from the shaking table a few days ago and threw them in the scrap iron pile at the time. As soon as he heard about repairing the water pipes, he immediately went to the scrap iron pile and found the pipes. The workers connected the four pipelines that day and blocked the clear water pipeline. In this way, the wastewater flowed according to people's will, rushing to the classifier through the pipes.

A few days later, the maintenance workers repaired a 300-meter-long pipe and sent 300 tons of wastewater per hour from the three-stage dewatering trough of the second ore dressing system to drive the ore grinding machine of the first ore dressing system. From then on, the only "water guzzler" in the plant that used only clear water and no recycled water was reduced from more than 540 tons per hour in the past to more than 240 tons. This circulating system connected the first and second ore dressing systems. As long as the second ore dressing system operates normally, the first ore dressing system will also operate effortlessly.

    Cherishing Water Like Oil

Every process here involves ore powder and water, and there are water pipes and valves everywhere. The operating site inevitably has mud and slurry overflowing. In the past, when the water source was sufficient, leather water hoses were often used to flush the site, using a lot of water. But no one had ever calculated it. Now, seeing the machines stop running due to lack of water, the workers said they would no longer use water to wash the floor, and used brooms to sweep the floor. In the past, leaks could be found everywhere in the workshop, but now they have all been blocked. Even when workers wash their hands and faces after work, they try to use as little water as possible. After washing, they also pour the sewage into the dewatering trough for the machine to use repeatedly.

The mass water-saving movement has reversed the difficulty of the severe water shortage in the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant. The plant's hourly clear water consumption has been reduced from more than 6,000 tons in the past to more than 3,000 tons, and the water consumption per ton of raw ore has been reduced from nine tons to five and a half tons. This is equivalent to opening a new Xi River invisibly.

    英雄面前无难事
    本报记者　史越峨
    细河严密地封冻了。河身上没有一点缝隙，只是辽宁南芬选矿厂的水泵管深深地插在它的怀里，贪婪地吸吮它那枯干的乳汁，急躁地发出咔喳、咔喳的声音。
    在厂内复水泵房里，溢进来一股清水，那通浓缩池的两根复水管口，白沫四溅，哗啦、哗啦的像瀑布一样涌进来，一个翻身，又顺着管道流去了。复水加小量清水，在厂内循环不息地流动着，全厂十九个选矿系统也跟着转动了。2月份以来，精矿粉产量一股劲儿往上窜：七千吨、八千吨，九千吨，一万吨……。
    细河还是这条细河，水源没有变化，可是为什么1月份经常停机待水，2月份却使全部设备转动了呢？
      干旱的威胁
    南芬选矿厂整个生产过程的每一个工序都是和水打交道的。水源充足，机器就可以转动，选出质量好的精矿粉。选矿厂每小时需水五千多吨，唯一的水源是一条无名的小河——细河。生产在跃进，细河流量不但没有增加，入冬以来，水量反而减少，厂内供水奇缺。水！水！水！到处是一片要水的声音。南芬选矿厂在前进的道路上遭到了干旱的严重威胁！
    生产时断时续，机器转转又停停，一、二车间的三班长杨春泽和工人们，怎么也不能平静，急得在车间里直绕圈儿。参加党委召开的老工人座谈会之后，杨春泽心里多少平静了点。会议提出了提高排矿浓度的办法。但少给水提高浓度之后，排矿口是不是会堵塞呢？谁也没有把握。
    杨春泽和其他工人决心正式试验一下提高给矿和排矿浓度的操作方法。
    1月下旬头一天，杨春泽和同班工人一道，迎着清晨的寒风来到车间。接班时，一、二车间只转动三个系统，六个系统停着。接班之后，工人们各就各位，几个中心水阀和关键用水设备，都由老工人亲自掌握。只见中心水阀一圈一圈地慢慢往回缩小，从最大开放十几圈退回到三圈，球磨机上给矿浓度从20％上升到40％，脱水槽、磁选机的排矿浓度从30％，提高到50％。他们掌握了“看米下锅水”的原则：来矿多了，阀门稍稍开大一点，来矿少了，阀门开小点。这样三个系统连续运转四个小时，各方面都很正常，不但没有堵塞，尾矿流失比过去还低。
    “再多转动一个系统！”杨春泽想到这一点就立即爬上东山头，朝蓄水池里一望，好，水位不低！乐得他急忙回到车间，向老工人周清明说：“你快去开动第四系统吧！可要细水长流啊！”三个钟头以后，球磨机一个一个跟着转动起来了，快到交班时，车间九个系统转动了七个，创造了班产三百三十一吨，精矿粉含铁量高达65.76％，尾矿10.93％的新纪录。看到这个成绩，杨春泽高兴极了。可是，三、四车间怎样了呢？他急忙拿起电话听筒来问，只听得那边班长高俊丰的声音：
    “正常！”对话通过电流传遍全身，两个人同时发出了轻快的笑声。
    三、四车间究竟怎么样正常的呢？几天前，班长高俊丰想，杨春泽在闹高浓度操作，节约用水，我们也得把“吃水龙”收拾一下。“吃水龙”指的是最费水的脱水槽和磁选机，全车间有三十台，每台每小时要用水三吨多。“能不能在每一个球磨系统中关闭一台呢？”就在这一天，他们在磨矿能力不变的情况下，关闭了脱水槽和磁选机近十台，严格控制水阀用水，配合全厂行动，终于赢得了胜利。在水源不变的条件下，全厂十九个系统全部转动起来了。
      循环不息
    选矿厂的生产用水——清水和循环水，是一个完整的体系。地上地下，到处是蛛网般的水管。尤其是三、四车间的流水经过反复选矿之后，最后的废水、杂质，都顺着水管流进直径五十公尺宽的浓缩池里，经过沉淀，大量流水又返回到生产过程中应用，美中不足的是，一、二选矿系统没有这套设备，用水流失很大。兴建浓缩池后不仅工程量大，而且远水不能救近火，因此党委要求在现有条件下最大限度地把复水应用起来。这个号召打动了检修工人的心，他们立即开会商量，决定先接通一、二车间的两根关键管路。
    把第二磨矿系统两段脱水槽的废水接通给二次分级机用，距离只有八公尺，但因为流水量大，一定要直径四寸的铁管，可是材料库里恰巧没有这种管子。小组会上，检修组长刘振清把这个困难提出来，让大家一起想办法。工人耿希才前几天刚从摇床上换下来几根粗管子，当时就丢在废铁堆里了。他一听说修复水管的事，马上到废铁堆里把管子找了出来。工人们当天就把四个管路接通。又把清水管道堵住。这样，废水便按着人们的意志，顺着管子一股一股地向分级机涌去。
    几天之后，检修工人又修通了三百公尺长的一根管子，把二选三段脱水槽上每小时三百吨的废水，送去带动一选磨矿机。从此，全厂唯一只用清水不用复水的“吃水龙”从过去每小时用水五百四十多吨降低到二百四十多吨。这个循环系统把一选和二选连接起来了，只要二选正常运转，一选也就毫不费力地转动了。
      爱水如油
    这儿的每一个工序都是矿粉和水，到处是水管，水阀，操作场地免不了泥浆溢流。过去水源充足的时候，常用皮水管子冲刷场地，用水很多。可是过去谁也没计算过。现在，工人们眼看着因为缺水机器停止转动的情景，说什么也不再用水洗地了，扫地用起扫帚来。以前，车间里到处可以找到滴水的漏洞，现在也全部堵塞住了。甚至工人们下班以后洗手、洗脸，也尽量少用些水；洗过之后，还把污水倒进脱水槽里，让机器反复使用。
    群众性的节流运动挽回了南芬选矿厂用水奇缺的困难，全厂每小时耗用清水量从过去的六千多吨降低到三千多吨，每吨原矿石耗水量从九吨降低到五吨半。这就等于在无形中新开辟了一条细河。
