    Li Runchu Surpasses Shen Nong
  　Our reporter, Liu Yangshen
    According to ancient Chinese legend, Shen Nong tasted all kinds of herbs to treat diseases for the people, making immortal contributions. Today, Comrade Li Runchu, the Party Branch Secretary of Nixi Brigade, Dahe Dam People's Commune, Sinan County, on the banks of the Wujiang River in Guizhou, has also tasted all kinds of herbs and prepared various pesticides in order to eliminate crop pests and diseases. The commune members say with respectful tones: "Our old Li has surpassed Shen Nong."
    Whenever thirty-two-year-old Li Runchu leaves his house, he is either biting on some kind of grass root or chewing on some kind of tree bark. Several times his mouth was corroded by poisonous weeds, his tongue couldn't distinguish between sour, sweet, bitter, or spicy, and his teeth hurt so much he couldn't eat. What power supports him in doing this?
    Last year, when he led the commune members in drawing up a plan for increased agricultural production, the masses all said, "We are not afraid of lacking fertilizer or water, only afraid of pests in the fields." Yes, the key lies in solving the problem of pesticides for killing insects. However, pesticides such as DDT and BHC are in short supply and too expensive, and a distant water source cannot quench immediate thirst. At this time, Li Runchu thought of using herbal medicine to kill insects. In the past, when herding cattle for the landlords, weren't cherry leaves, walnut leaves, and elm leaves used to kill lice on the cattle? Wasn't the water boiled with *tiger hemp* used to extinguish the leaf beetles on vegetables? Also, in the past, when cutting grass for the cattle, if you accidentally got the sap of the *nodding parasol leaf* on your body, it would become red, swollen, and itchy. Could these things not kill insects? Li Runchu became happy when he thought of this. He decided to go up the mountain to find medicinal herbs that kill insects.
    Seeing that the pests were about to emerge from the soil, the task was so urgent. He visited herbal medicine doctors, traditional Chinese veterinarians, and experienced old farmers as teachers, while learning the basic knowledge of herbal medicine and climbing all over the nearby mountains and ridges. As long as he saw new and strange plants, he would pick them, smear the juice on his hands, or put them in his mouth to taste. In this way, he was once poisoned, his body was swollen, his mouth and tongue were numb, and he even fainted. But he did not waver in his determination to find medicinal herbs to kill insects.
    With the support of the masses, Li Runchu finally discovered that there were more than 160 kinds of poisonous weeds on the nearby mountains, of which more than 40 kinds were produced in large quantities and were highly effective.
    Li Runchu collected a large pile of jars and cans. These jars and cans contained medicinal liquids or powders made from different poisonous weeds. Then he caught some pests and put them in the jars for testing. He found that insects and sparrows dared not eat seeds mixed with "snake corn" (a kind of herb). He found that using wild tobacco to make medicinal pellets to kill rice stem borers, corn borers, and wheat flea beetles was not very effective, because these pests have a layer of fine hairs on the outside of their bodies, making it impossible for the medicinal pellets to come into contact with the insects' flesh. However, spraying an aqueous solution made from tobacco stalks could kill the insects. There are many such examples.
    The success of Li Runchu's use of local pesticides to control insects has strengthened the confidence of the commune members of Nixi Brigade in eradicating pests. More than 6,000 commune members collected 102 kinds of herbal medicines in ten days and applied them to more than 1,800 mu of paddy fields, killing stem borers within three hours. After winning the first battle, they advanced victoriously, using water soaked with wild cotton and tobacco stalks to kill wheat thrips and cotton red spiders, and the effect was also very good. Last year, thanks to the great power of local pesticides, grain production increased by nearly one-half compared with 1957. The saying that Li Runchu surpassed Shen Nong has therefore spread among the masses.
    Last autumn, Li Runchu attended the First Guizhou Provincial Science Conference as a local pesticide expert, which gave him great encouragement. Now he is determined to study the life history of crop pests and improve the efficacy of local pesticides, in addition to doing a good job as the secretary of the Party general branch. He also plans to write materials on using local pesticides to kill insects this year for reference by various places. (Attached picture)

    黎润初赛神农
  　本报记者　刘扬深
    我国古代相传神农遍尝百草，为人们治疗疾病，立下不朽的功劳；而今，贵州乌江江畔的思南县大河坝人民公社泥溪大队党支部书记黎润初同志，为了消灭农作物的病虫害，也尝遍了百草，配制各种农药。社员们带着尊敬的口吻说：“我们的老黎赛过了神农。”
    三十二岁的黎润初一出家门，不是咬咬这种草根，就是嚼嚼那种树皮，有好几次口腔被毒草腐蚀了舌头，分不出酸甜苦辣，牙齿也疼得不能吃东西。是什么力量支持他这样做呢？
    去年他领导社员订农业增产计划时，群众都说“不怕无肥缺水，只怕地里生虫。”是的，关键在于解决杀虫的农药问题。可是滴滴涕、六六六等杀虫农药供不应求，价钱太贵，远水救不了近火。这时黎润初想起了利用草药杀虫的办法。过去给地主家放牛时，不是用樱桃叶、核桃叶、麻柳叶杀死牛身上的虱子吗？蔬菜上的铁甲虫，不是用老虎麻熬水扑灭了吗？还有，过去割牛草时身上一不小心沾上灯台草的浆液，就会红肿痒痛，难道这些东西不能杀死害虫？黎润初想到这些高兴起来了，他决心上山找杀虫的药草。
    眼看害虫要出土，任务是这样紧迫。他到处拜草药医生、中兽医和老农为师，一边学习草药的基本知识，一边爬遍附近的大山峻岭，只要看到新奇的植物就采摘下来，把汁液抹在手上，或是放在嘴里尝尝。就这样他曾经中毒，身体浮肿了，口舌麻木了，甚至昏倒了。但他没有因此动摇寻找药草杀虫的决心。
    在群众的支持下，黎润初终于发现附近山上有毒草一百六十多种，其中四十多种出产多、效力大。
    黎润初搜集了一大堆坛坛罐罐，在这些坛坛罐罐里，装有不同毒草配做成的药液或药粉，然后捕捉一些害虫放在坛子里作试验。他发现用“蛇包谷”（一种草药）拌的种子，虫子和麻雀都不敢吃；他发现用野烟制药粒杀水稻螟虫、玉米钻心虫、小麦金花虫的效力不大，因为这些害虫身体外边都有一层细毛，使药粒接触不到虫子的肉体；但是用烟秆制成水剂喷射，就可以杀死虫子。这样的例子还很多。
    黎润初用土农药治虫成功的事实，使泥溪大队的社员坚定了根治虫害的信心。六千多名社员在十天内采集了一百零二种草药，加工后施在一千八百多亩稻田里，三小时内杀死了螟虫。第一仗打胜了，他们乘胜前进，用野棉花和烟秆泡水杀小麦吸浆虫和棉田红蜘蛛，效果也很好。去年由于土农药大显威风，粮食比1957年增产将近二分之一。黎润初赛过神农的说法，也因此在群众中传开了。
    去年秋后，黎润初以土农药专家身份出席了贵州省第一次科学工作会议，这给了他很大的鼓舞。现在他决心在做好党总支书记的工作外，研究农作物害虫的生活史和提高土农药效力等专题，并计划在今年写出用土农药杀虫的材料，供给各地参考。（附图片）
