	Zhang Qiuxiang and Xue Junxiu, nationally renowned cotton-growing experts, helped each other in the competition and openly shared their methods for increasing production. People praise this story as a fine example. Zhang Qiuxiang and her counterpart did a great job! They are the people who understand the true meaning of competition. Because, even if one person has boundless strength, it is still as insignificant as a drop in the ocean when it comes to the grand construction cause of the whole nation. However, tiny streams can converge into the sea, and the combined wisdom and energy of everyone can move mountains and fill seas. Let's take Zhang Qiuxiang's story as an example to calculate the benefits. Although the several mu of cotton that Zhang Qiuxiang planted had already reached the high-yield record of a thousand catties of seed cotton per mu since 1955, these several thousand catties of seed cotton are insignificant compared to the needs of the people of the whole country. However, if nearly 100 million mu of cotton fields across the country could achieve the same high yield as Zhang Qiuxiang's, then we would harvest more than tens of millions of dan of cotton every year!
	Now, Zhang Qiuxiang has long been actively teaching her cotton-planting techniques to everyone who comes to learn from her, and selflessly helping her competitor Xue Junxiu eliminate cotton pests and learn new technologies... Now, Xue Junxiu has not only learned Zhang Qiuxiang's techniques, increasing the yield of seed cotton per mu from more than forty catties in the past to three thousand catties in 1958, but also learned Zhang Qiuxiang's spirit of utter devotion to the collective, and is helping her competitors and those around her. Doing so has further promoted her own greater leap forward. Last year, the cotton Zhang Qiuxiang planted also yielded as high as more than two thousand nine hundred catties per mu, doubling the yield of 1957. The story of these two cotton-growing experts soaring together can further inspire profound thought: In the great socialist competition, how can the spirit of revolutionary heroism be maximized between advanced individuals? The purpose of our competition is not to judge who is superior or inferior, but to advance together and accelerate the pace of socialist construction. Here, the honor belongs to our socialist system, to our collective cause, and to those advanced individuals who enthusiastically help others!

    展翅齐飞
    杨眉
    全国闻名的植棉能手张秋香和薛俊秀在竞赛中互相帮助，彼此向对方公开了增产措施。这个故事，人们传为美谈。张秋香她们做得好！她们是懂得了竞赛的真正意义的人。因为，纵然一个人的力大无比，对于全国如此宏伟的建设事业说来，只好比沧海之一粟，实在渺小得很。然而，涓涓细流能够汇成大海，每一个人的最大智慧、最大干劲汇总起来，就能够移山填海。以张秋香的故事为例来算一笔账吧。张秋香种的几亩棉花，虽然从1955年起就已经达到亩产千斤籽棉的丰产纪录，但是这几千斤籽棉，同全国人民的需要比起来，是微乎其微的。然而，倘若全国近亿亩棉田都能像张秋香的一样高产，那么，我们每年收获的棉花何止几千万担！
    现在，张秋香早就积极地把自己的植棉技术传授给每一个来向她学习的人，并且无私地帮助她的竞赛者薛俊秀除棉虫，学习新技术……现在，薛俊秀不但学会了张秋香的技术，把籽棉的亩产量从过去的四十多斤提高到1958年的三千斤，而且还学会了张秋香的大公无私的精神，正在帮助着她的竞赛者和周围的人。这样做，又促进了自己更大的跃进。张秋香去年种的棉花，每亩产量也高达二千九百多斤，比1957年翻了一番。这两位植棉能手展翅齐飞的故事，能更加发人深省：在社会主义大竞赛中，在先进者与先进者之间，怎样才能最大地发挥革命英雄主义的精神？我们竞赛的目的，并不是为评个高低，比个上下，而是为了共同前进，加快社会主义建设的步伐。在这里，荣誉是属于我们的社会主义制度，属于我们的集体的事业，属于那些热情地帮助别人的先进分子！
