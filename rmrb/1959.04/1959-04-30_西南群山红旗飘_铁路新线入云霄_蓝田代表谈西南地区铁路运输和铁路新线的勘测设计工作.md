Comrades Representatives:
    I fully support the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am determined to implement them resolutely.
    Now, I will give the assembly a brief report on the leap forward situation in railway transportation and new railway construction survey and design work in the Southwest region.
    1958 was a year of great leaps forward in all aspects of work in our country. Railway transportation operations and new railway construction survey and design work in the Southwest region, under the correct leadership of the Party, also made great leaps forward and achieved great successes, just like all other aspects of work.
    First, the broad masses of staff and workers of the entire institute and bureau conscientiously implemented the Party’s General Line for Socialist Construction, liberated their thinking, broke down superstitions, and launched a mass movement for a great leap forward in production centered on technological and cultural revolution, achieving victory in the struggle between the two lines of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results versus achieving fewer, slower, worse, and more expensive results. This victory powerfully impacted right-leaning conservative ideas such as "survey and design work cannot achieve a high-speed leap forward" and "there is no possibility of creation or invention in this kind of work," thereby greatly raising the ideological consciousness of all staff and workers, establishing a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and a style of hard work, clever work, and practical work. In order to conquer nature and support the iron and steel industry, they despised all difficulties, singing the magnificent poem "Pioneers run ahead, not afraid of knife-edge mountains, difficulties are like paper tigers, they'll be defeated when they meet the pioneers" at all times and places, marching into mountainous areas of the Tibetan Plateau at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, passing through the highest peaks of the Daba Mountains where few people tread, scaring away the poisonous snakes and ferocious beasts in the primitive forests on both banks of the Hongshui River, and running across a large area of 1.3 million square kilometers, conducting survey and design for more than 110 routes, planting bright red flags all over the large and small mountains of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, forming the railway network of the Southwest region, closely connecting with the national railway network plan, making the country's railways extend in all directions, as dense as a spider web.
    Secondly, in terms of transportation, 10,052,600 tons of goods were transported in 1958, an increase of 38.2 percent compared to 1957. Passenger transportation volume reached 10,113,000 people, an increase of 23 percent compared to 1957. Freight car turnaround time was 1.53 days, a reduction of 0.07 days compared to 1957, and freight car net load was 32.8 tons, an increase of 1.3 times compared to 1957. Transportation costs were reduced by 10.6 percent. Basic construction investment was 68.02 million yuan, 113 percent of the plan. Under the circumstances of a sharp increase in transportation and insufficient equipment, the national plan was overfulfilled, ensuring the transportation needs of large quantities of materials with steel as the key link. The survey and design work of the Second Design Institute completed a total of 6,754 converted kilometers and 5,105 file kilometers in 1958, more than three times the task stipulated in the March base construction meeting last year (1,627 converted kilometers, 1,182 file kilometers), equivalent to 2.4 times the total task completed during the first Five-Year Plan period. Such a high-speed increase is unprecedented. In terms of quality, there has also been a great improvement. The design documents of the past year have been well received by all parties after appraisal and construction testing. In order to meet the requirements of the rapid development of industry and agriculture and the continuous increase in transportation volume, powerful traction designs such as internal combustion and electrification have been adopted to improve route standards, increase curve radius, adopt gentle slopes, lengthen station platform length, and increase passing capacity, to meet the needs of engineering and transportation. In the implementation of the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, many achievements have also been made. In survey and design, we relied on the Party, relied on the local areas, relied on the masses, ran around more, asked more questions, made more comparisons, and conducted more research to find routes that were both economical and reasonable. Adhering to the technical policies of "strengthening the main line and weakening the branch lines," "consolidating the foundation and simplifying the details," "building the branch lines before the main line," and "no changes without a main line," we recognized the primary and secondary, carefully calculated, and used local materials. On the basis of ensuring quality, we reduced project costs. For example, in survey expenses, the actual expenditure per converted kilometer in 1958 was 1,058 yuan, a decrease of 87.6 percent compared to the 8,560 yuan per converted kilometer during the first Five-Year Plan period. In terms of technological revolution and cultural revolution, in 1958, staff and workers of the entire institute contributed more than 168,000 suggestions, of which 361 were major innovations. Twenty-one items were exhibited in Beijing and reached the national level after appraisal, 180 items reached the institute level, and 216 advanced experiences were promoted. For example, the inclined slope stadia method, rapid leveling method, and flat panel cross-section instrument improved work efficiency four to six times. Other instruments such as the double-inclined ruler triangle instrument and precision stadia rod also improved work efficiency several times, greatly reducing labor intensity, thereby enabling survey work to advance at a high speed. In 1958, eight scientific research projects were also completed, such as the derivation of the Coulomb earth pressure formula, the summary of arch culvert design, the research on lightweight prefabricated houses, and the trial production of lightweight drilling machines, all of which may be successful in the short term. Other new technologies such as internal combustion traction, electric traction, earthen humps, mechanical humps, microwave communication, electrical centralization, automatic blocking, and large-span bridges, high bridges, and long tunnels have gradually been mastered.
    Over the past year, the acquisition of the above-mentioned great achievements has been mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party, the adherence to putting politics in command, the resolute implementation of the General Line, the strong support of local party and government at all levels and the masses of the people, and the sky-high enthusiasm and hard work of all staff and workers. As mentioned earlier, our work achievements in 1958 were great, and our experience was rich, but it cannot be denied that there are still some shortcomings in our work. For example, although the quantity of survey and design documents last year increased greatly compared with the past, the quality is not high enough; the development of internal and external production is still unbalanced; the grasp of technical policies and technical principles is not stable enough; and industrial accidents have not been completely eliminated, all of which need to be overcome and improved through hard work.
    1959 is a year of decisive significance in our country's three years of hard struggle. The greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production gives the railway transportation industry an even heavier task. In order to do this year's work better and faster, we propose the following guarantees: (1) Every technician must complete 9.4 converted kilometers and 6.3 file kilometers within one year; (2) In terms of quality, we require that the route direction is correct, errors are eliminated, and all documents should meet the requirements of construction and transportation; (3) We should carefully calculate, use local materials, save a large amount of steel and cement, reduce costs, and the average survey cost per kilometer should not exceed 945 yuan; (4) We should strengthen production safety and eliminate accidents; (5) We should grasp production with one hand and life with the other, and continuously improve the material and cultural life of staff and workers on the basis of improving production.
    This year, most of the new routes in the Southwest region are in snow-capped mountain areas and more primitive forest areas, with high altitude and cold weather, inconvenient transportation, many glacier landslides, and extremely bad geology. In addition, the technical force is insufficient, so we will encounter many difficulties in our work. However, we firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, as long as we rely on the masses, continue to liberate our minds, oppose conservatism, vigorously carry out mass movements, vigorously engage in technological revolution, combine sky-high enthusiasm with scientific analysis, resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs," and fight bravely, we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the arduous and glorious task that the state has given us this year.

    西南群山红旗飘　铁路新线入云霄
    蓝田代表谈西南地区铁路运输和铁路新线的勘测设计工作各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    现在，我把西南区铁路运输和铁路新建的跃进情况向大会作一简要的汇报。
    一九五八年是我国各项工作大跃进的一年，西南地区的铁路运输业务和铁路新建的勘测设计工作，在党的正确领导下，也和其他各项工作一样，有很大的跃进，取得了巨大的成绩。
    首先，全院、局广大职工，认真贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线，解放了思想，破除了迷信，开展了以技术革命和文化革命为中心内容的生产大跃进的群众运动，取得了多快好省与少慢差费两条路线斗争的胜利，这一胜利，有力冲击了“勘测设计工作不可能高速度跃进”、“这种工作没有什么可能创造发明”等等右倾保守思想，从而大大地提高了全体职工的思想觉悟，树立了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格和苦干、巧干、实干的作风。为了征服自然，支援钢铁，他们藐视一切困难，随时随地唱着那雄伟的“尖兵跑在前，不怕尖刀山，困难好比纸老虎，碰上尖兵就完蛋”的诗歌，向高山深谷进军。他们深切地体会到“修通幸福路，先行走在前，山区人民天天望，干劲怎能不冲天。”凭他们的忘我劳动和大无畏的精神，进入了西藏高原拔海四千余公尺的山区，穿过了人迹罕到的大巴山最高峰，吓走了红水河两岸原始森林中的毒蛇猛兽，跑遍了一百三十万平方公里的大面积，进行了一百一十多条路线的勘测设计，把鲜红的红旗插遍了川、云、贵、桂的大小山峰，构成了西南区的铁路网，与祖国的路网规划密切接连起来，使祖国的铁路四通八达，密如蛛网。
    其次，在运输方面，一九五八年运送货物一千零五十二万六千吨，比一九五七年增长百分之三十八点二。旅客运输量完成一千零一十一万三千人，比一九五七年增长百分之二十三。货车周转时间完成一点五三天，较一九五七年压缩零点零七天，货车净载重完成三十二点八吨，较一九五七年提高一点三倍，运输成本降低百分之十点六。基本建设投资完成六千八百零二万元，为计划的百分之一百一十三。在运输猛增，设备不足的情况下，超额完成了国家计划，保证了以钢为纲的大批物资运输的需要。第二设计院的勘测设计工作，一九五八年共完成六千七百五十四折算公里，五千一百零五文件公里，等于去年三月基建会议规定任务（一千六百二十七折算公里，一千一百八十二文件公里）的三倍多，相当于第一个五年计划期中所完成任务总和的二点四倍。这样高速度的增长，是从所未有的。在质量方面，也有很大的提高。一年来的设计文件，经过鉴定和施工考验，均得到各方面的好评。为适应工农业飞跃发展和运量不断增长的要求，曾采用内燃化、电气化的强力牵引设计，提高路线标准，加大曲线半径，采用缓坡度，加长站坪长度，增加通过能力，适应了满足工程和运输的需要。在贯彻勤俭办企业的方针方面，也取得了不少成绩。在勘测设计中，做到了依靠党，依靠地方，依靠群众，多跑、多问、多比较、多研究，找出既经济、又合理的路线。本着“强干弱支”、“固本简末”、“先支后干”、“无干不变”的技术政策，来认识主次，精打细算，就地取材。在保证质量的基础上，降低工程造价，如在勘测费用开支上，一九五八年每一折算公里的实际支出为一千零五十八元，较第一个五年计划期内每一个折算公里八千五百六十元降低了百分之八十七点六。在技术革命和文化革命方面，一九五八年全院职工献计献策十六万八千多条，其中有重大革新的三百六十一条，在京展览经过鉴定达到全国水平者二十一项，达到全院水平者一百八十项，推广先进经验二百一十六项。如斜坡视距法，快速抄平法，平板横断面仪等，提高工效四至六倍。其他如双斜尺三角仪，精密视距尺等都提高工效数倍以上，大大减轻了劳动强度，从而使勘测工作得到高速度地前进。一九五八年还完成了科学研究项目八项，诸如库伦扩土墙公式的推导，拱形明洞设计的总结，轻型装配式房屋的研究，轻型探钻机的试制等，在短期内都可能获得成功。其余如内燃牵引，电气牵引，土驼峰，机械驼峰，微波通讯，电气集中，自动闭塞以及大跨度桥，高桥，长隧道等等新技术已逐渐被掌握。
    一年来，上述巨大成就的获得，主要是由于党的领导正确，坚持了政治挂帅，坚决贯彻执行了总路线，各级地方党政和人民群众的大力支持以及全体职工干劲冲天，辛勤劳动的结果。如前所述，一九五八年我们工作成就是巨大的，经验也是丰富的，但不能否认，我们在工作中也还存在一些缺点。如去年勘测设计文件的数量虽比过去增加很大，但质量还不够高；在内外生产上发展尚不平衡；对技术政策和技术原则的掌握上还不够稳，以及公伤事故未完全消灭等，均待努力克服和改进。
    一九五九年是我国苦战三年中具有决定意义的一年。工农业生产的更大跃进，给予铁路运输业的任务更加繁重。为了把今年的工作作的更好，更快，我们提出如下保证：（一）每一个技术人员一年内必须完成九点四折算公里，六点三文件公里；（二）在质量上要求路线方向正确，消灭差错，所有文件均应适应施工要求和运输要求；（三）精打细算，就地取材，大量节约钢材和水泥，降低造价，勘测费用平均每公里不超过九百四十五元；（四）加强生产安全，消灭事故；（五）一手抓生产，一手抓生活，在提高生产的基础上，不断改善职工的物质和文化生活。
    今年西南区的新建路线多在雪山区域和较多的原始森林地区，地势高寒，交通不便，有许多冰川滑坡，地质极其恶劣；加之技术力量不足，在工作中是会遇到不少困难的。但是我们深信，在党的领导下，只要我们依靠群众，继续解放思想，反对保守，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，把冲天干劲和科学分析结合起来，坚决贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，奋勇战斗，我们一定能够完成和超额完成今年国家给予我们艰巨而光荣的任务。
