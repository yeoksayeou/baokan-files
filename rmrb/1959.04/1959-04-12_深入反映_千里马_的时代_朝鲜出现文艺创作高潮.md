To deeply reflect Korea’s current "Chollima" era, Korean artists have launched a high tide of creation and performance. Various forms of excellent artistic works are constantly emerging, and the stages in Pyongyang and other places are showing a prosperous scene this spring.

This year, Korean artists are preparing to create thirty dramas and dance dramas, more than one hundred musical and dance programs, and twenty-five art films. This is much more than last year, and the production of art films will be three times that of last year.

Recently, theaters in Pyongyang performed new works by Korean artists this spring. The dance drama "Red Heart," performed at the National Dance Theater, which depicts steel workers fighting for steel, and the drama "Chollima," performed by the Ministry of Transportation Art Theater, were warmly welcomed by the audience. These works were created through the collective wisdom of many young artists after delving deeply into life. Currently, more than 80% of writers and more than half of the artists have gone deep into factories and rural areas to carry out creative activities.

　　深入反映“千里马”的时代
　　朝鲜出现文艺创作高潮
    朝鲜的艺术家们为了深入反映朝鲜当前的“千里马”时代，掀起了一个创作和演出的高潮。各种形式的优秀艺术作品正在不断涌现出来，平壤等地的舞台今春呈现着繁荣景象。
    今年朝鲜的艺术家们准备创作三十个话剧和舞剧，一百多个音乐舞蹈节目，以及二十五部艺术影片。这比去年增加很多，艺术影片的产量将相当于去年的三倍。
    最近平壤市各剧院演出了朝鲜艺术家们今年春天的新作品。在国立舞蹈剧场演出的表现钢铁工人为钢铁而战的舞剧“红心”和交通省艺术剧场演出的话剧“千里马”等都受到了观众的热烈欢迎。这些作品都是许多青年艺术家深入生活以后，以集体的智慧创作出来的。目前有80％以上的作家和半数以上的艺术家深入到工厂和农村进行创作活动。
