On the Question of How to Break Away from the Dynastic System When Writing Our Country's History

How to break away from the dynastic system and write our country's history according to social nature-based periodization is a question that China's historical circles have long been concerned about. There have always been several different views on this issue, but they have not sparked widespread discussion. The Chinese historian Jian Bozan published an article in "New Construction" in March 1959, presenting his personal views on this question.

He does not agree with the view held by some comrades that breaking away from the dynastic system requires excluding the dynastic titles and the history of the dynasties themselves from the general history of China. He says, first, dynastic titles are an objective reality that we should respect; second, dynastic titles are symbols of the times, and one dynasty appearing after another is precisely a milestone in the development of Chinese history; third, dynastic titles, like AD and centuries, do not prevent us from discovering the regularity of history; what prevents us from discovering the regularity of history is the dynastic system.

Therefore, he believes that "we have the right to break away from the dynastic system, but we have no right to arbitrarily delete dynastic titles, because the former is the historian's viewpoint, while the latter is a historical fact." The task of historical research lies in starting from the specific historical facts of these dynasties, and revealing the regularity of history through analysis and generalization of these historical facts. He advocates using AD and century dating in the general history of China, but when the dynastic title is needed to strengthen the concept of time, it is best to write the dynastic title, because for the history of a specific country, the dynastic title of that country is a clearer symbol of the times than AD and centuries. The time indicated by the dynasty is not general time, empty time, but time filled with specific historical content. Writing the dynastic title only has advantages and no disadvantages. He says that perhaps some people say that the dynasty has drawn some unnecessary paragraphs for us in history: some dynastic changes do not show socio-economic changes, such as the Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen dynasties; on the other hand, when paragraphs should be divided in history, the dynasty has not changed, for example, Chinese society before and after the Opium War obviously underwent essential changes, but the Qing dynasty did not collapse because of this change. This situation brings some unnecessary trouble to historians. He believes that historians should bear this trouble and find out the context, tendency, and regularity of the entire historical development from this complicated historical fact of indecisiveness when needed and decisiveness when not needed. He also disagrees with deleting the activities of emperors, generals, and ministers, the internal struggles of the ruling class, and political systems and political evolutions that are traditionally considered very important. He says that the history based on the masses of the people does not exclude the role of individual figures in history, just as Lenin said, "The whole history is composed of the actions of individuals who are undoubtedly activists," and these activists include emperors, generals, and ministers. The change of dynasties in the history of China's feudal period draws a curve of political fluctuations, and this political fluctuation cannot be unrelated to socio-economic factors, so political evolution cannot be completely ignored, and talking about evolution is also to highlight the mainstream of history.

Following Jian Bozan, "New Construction" published an article by Tang Lan in its April issue. Tang Lan believes that what should be broken is the "dynastic history system" with a long tradition in Chinese history, not "breaking the dynastic system." The author advocates using peasant uprisings as the mainstream of history, and writing about the dynasties after these uprisings. The author believes that this will not only highlight the uprisings of the peasant masses, but also basically realistically write about the historical facts of the dynasties. The author believes that if the Republican Uprising is regarded as the first uprising of the Chinese people against the ruling class, there were nine major uprisings before the Opium War.

1. Republican Uprising. Later, it went through King Xuan of Zhou, King You, King Ping, the Spring and Autumn Period, the Warring States Period to the Qin Dynasty. The collapse of slave society went through division and separation to the formation of a centralized feudal state.
2. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang's uprising. Later, Liu Bang established the Han Dynasty.
3. Red Eyebrows uprising. Later, Liu Xiu established the Han Dynasty.
4. Yellow Turban uprising. Later, it went through the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Sui Dynasty, from division to reunification.
5. Dou Jiande's uprising. Later, Li Yuan and Li Shimin established the Tang Dynasty.
6. Huang Chao's uprising. Later, it went through the Five Dynasties of division and separation to the Song Dynasty, reunifying again.
7. Fang La's uprising. Later, it went through the Southern Song and Jin divisions and separations to the Yuan Dynasty, reunifying again.
8. Xu Fushou and Han Lin'er's uprising. Later, Zhu Yuanzhang established the Ming Dynasty.
9. Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong's uprising. Later, the Manchurian soldiers entered the customs and established the Qing Dynasty.

### 在编写我国历史时  如何打破王朝体系的问题

    在编写我国历史时
    如何打破王朝体系的问题
    如何打破王朝体系按照社会性质分期来写我国的历史，这是我国历史学界长期关心的问题。对这个问题历来也存在几种不同的看法，只是没有引起很广泛的讨论。我国历史学家翦伯赞，在“新建设”1959年3月号上发表了一篇文章，就这个问题提出了他个人的看法。
    他不赞成对目前有些同志认为要打破王朝体系就连王朝的称号和王朝本身的历史，也要从中国通史中排除出去的见解。他说，第一、王朝的称号是一种客观存在，我们应该尊重；第二、王朝称号是时代的符号，一个跟着一个出现的王朝，正是中国历史在其发展进程中的里程碑；第三、王朝的称号和公元和世纪一样，并不妨碍我们去发现历史的规律性；妨碍我们发现历史规律性的是王朝体系。
    因此，他认为，“我们有权打破王朝体系，但无权任意删去王朝的称号，因为前者是史学家的观点，而后者是历史事实”。历史研究的任务就在从这些王朝的具体史实出发，通过对这些史实的分析概括，揭示历史的规律性。他主张在中国通史中采用公元和世纪纪年，但需要用王朝的称号加强时间概念的地方最好写上王朝称号，因为对于特定国家的历史来说，那个国家的王朝称号，比之公元、世纪是一种更明确的时代符号。王朝所指示的时间，不是一般的时间、空洞的时间，而是种特定的历史内容充实了的时间。写上王朝的称号，只有好处，没有坏处。他说，也许有人说，王朝替我们在历史上划出了一些不必要的段落：有些王朝更替并不表现社会经济的变革，例如宋、齐、梁、陈就是如此；另一方面，在历史上应该划分段落的时候，王朝又没有更替，例如鸦片战争以前和鸦片战争以后的中国社会，显然起了本质上的变革，而清朝并没有因为这种变革而垮台。这种情况就替史学家带来了一些不必要的麻烦。他认为史学家应该承担这种麻烦，从这种当断不断、不当断而断的错综复杂的历史事实中，找出整个历史发展的脉络、倾向及其规律性。他也不同意将帝王将相的活动，统治阶级内部的斗争，以及传统上视为十分重要的政治制度、政治沿革都予以删减。他说，以人民群众为主的历史，并不排除个别人物在历史上的作用，正像列宁所说的“全部历史正是由那些无疑是活动家的个人行动构成的”，而这些活动家是包括帝王将相在内的。王朝的更替，在中国封建时期的历史中，画出了一条政治波动的曲线，这种政治波动不能不和社会经济有关，因此政治沿革也不能完全不讲，而讲沿革也是为了突出历史的主流。
    继翦伯赞之后，“新建设”4月号又发表了唐兰的一篇文章，唐兰认为应该打破的是中国历史上有很久传统的“王朝史体系”而不是“打破王朝体系”。作者主张以农民起义作为历史的主流，而把王朝放在这些起义以后来写，作者认为这样就既突出了农民群众的起义，也基本上能如实地写出王朝的历史事实。作者认为，如果把共和起义作为中国人民反抗统治阶级的第一次起义的话，到鸦片战争之前共有九次大起义。
    一、共和起义。以后经过周宣王、幽王、平王、春秋、战国而至秦。由奴隶社会的崩溃经过分裂割据到中央集权的封建国家的形成。
    二、陈胜吴广等起义。以后刘邦建立了汉王朝。
    三、赤眉等起义。以后刘秀建立了汉王朝。
    四、黄巾等起义。以后经过魏晋南北朝而至隋，经分裂而重新统一。
    五、窦建德等起义。以后李渊、李世民建立了唐王朝。
    六、黄巢等起义。以后经过五代分裂割据而至宋，重新统一。
    七、方腊等起义。以后经过南宋和金分裂割据而至元，重新统一。
    八、徐福寿韩林儿等起义。以后朱元璋建立了明王朝。
    九、李自成张献忠等起义。以后满洲兵入关，建立了清王朝。
