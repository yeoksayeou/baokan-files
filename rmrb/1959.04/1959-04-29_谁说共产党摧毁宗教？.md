    Who Says the Communist Party Destroys Religion?

    To the Editor:
    Indian expansionists fabricate rumors, saying that "the Communist Party destroys religion."
    We are Buddhists, and here we must specifically mention the issue of religion. We Buddhists throughout China have had very profound personal experiences in the nearly ten years since liberation. The Party and the People's Government have helped Buddhists repair countless temples and cultural relics, and the monks and nuns also have full material guarantees for their lives. Chanting scriptures, worshiping Buddha, and holding Dharma assemblies are all carried out as usual. We Bhikkhus from all over the country are studying and researching Buddhism at the Buddhist academy of the Buddhist circles of New China, the Buddhist Academy of China, living a Buddhist life in accordance with the Dharma. The facts are there, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, too many to list. No rumors from any foreign reactionaries can make Chinese Buddhists doubt the policy of freedom of religious belief, and any attempt to incite our country's Buddhists and foreign Buddhist friends to oppose the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government is a futile attempt.
    Historically, our country and India have always had friendly exchanges and peaceful coexistence. Buddhist Bhikkhu scholars have also exchanged visits to study and propagate the Dharma. After the founding of New China, our Premier Zhou Enlai and Indian Prime Minister Nehru pioneered the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The people of our country are friendly to the people of India, and many friends in India also support our country's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, which is welcome. However, for some Indian expansionists to unscrupulously advocate declaring "Tibetan independence" and shamelessly say that India should inherit the so-called "monopoly rights" of British imperialism over Tibet is a conspiracy to grossly interfere in our country's internal affairs. This is intolerable! We solemnly warn you that today's New China is no longer the old China of the past. The era when imperialism ran rampant and did whatever it wanted on our country's territory is gone forever. Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and no foreign reactionaries can separate Tibet from Chinese territory.
        All members of the Buddhist Academy of China

    谁说共产党摧毁宗教？编辑同志：
    印度的扩张主义分子捏造谣言，说什么“共产党摧毁宗教”。
    我们是佛教徒，这里特别要提一下宗教问题。我们全中国的佛教徒在解放近十年来的亲身体会是非常深刻的。党和人民政府帮助佛教徒修了无数的寺庙、文物古迹，僧尼的生活也有充分的物质保证。念经拜佛做法会都是照常进行。我们来自全国各地的比丘在新中国佛教界的学府中国佛学院学习和研究佛学，过着如法的佛教生活，事实俱在，数如恒沙，举不胜举。任何外国反动分子的任何造谣都不能使中国佛教徒对于宗教信仰自由政策产生怀疑，任何妄想煽动我国佛教徒和外国佛教朋友反对中国共产党和人民政府都是枉费心机的。
    我国和印度在历史上一直是友好往来与和平相处的，佛教比丘学者亦彼此往来学法和传教弘法。新中国成立后，我国周恩来总理又和印度尼赫鲁总理首创和平共处的五项原则。我国人民对于印度人民是友好的，而印度有许多朋友也都是支持我国平定西藏叛乱的，这是值得我们欢迎的。可是，对于印度的某些扩张主义分子肆无忌惮地主张宣布“西藏独立”，并且无耻地说印度应当继承英帝国主义对西藏的所谓“垄断权利”，这是粗暴干涉我国内政的阴谋。是可忍，孰不可忍？我们严正警告你们，今天的新中国已不是已往的旧中国了，帝国主义在我国领土上横行霸道为所欲为的时代永远一去不复返了，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，任何外国反动分子都不能把西藏从中国领土上分裂出去。
        中国佛学院全体人员
