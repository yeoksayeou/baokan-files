Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 15th. The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Affairs" published an article on the 14th entitled "Who is Secretly Undermining Arab Unity?" stating that Yugoslav revisionists are playing the shameful role of a "Trojan horse" in the Arab national liberation movement. The article pointed out that recent events have shown that imperialism and reactionaries are not only engaging in slanderous propaganda and intimidation, but also conducting conspiracies and directly participating in organizing reactionary rebellions and provocations against the Republic of Iraq. When these conspiracies were thoroughly defeated, some people frantically engaged in anti-communist and anti-Soviet activities.

The article stated that Yugoslav sham Marxists are not lagging behind in the ranks of those clamoring against Arab communists. According to their divisive line, the Belgrade revisionists are making every effort to isolate the communist parties of Arab countries and push them onto the so-called "Yugoslav road." This road is opposed to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, other Marxist-Leninist parties, and the entire international communist movement; it is a road of division and surrender to the most vicious enemies of the people of all countries - imperialism.

The article went on to point out that the firm attitude of the communist parties of Arab countries and their unity shattered this despicable conspiracy of the Yugoslav revisionists. The communist parties of Arab countries, working in complex environments, are infinitely loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and no trickery has or can ever push them onto dangerous deviations. This greatly angered the revisionists in Belgrade. Thus, they openly and shamelessly attacked the Syrian Communist Party, the Iraqi Communist Party, and other Arab communist parties, especially opposing the leaders of these national parties. The hoarse voices of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's leadership group are mixed in with the howling against Arab communists.

The article emphasized that the only difference between the Yugoslav leadership group's attacks on Arab communists and the imperialists' rumors and slanders is that the former is masked by a thin veil—Marxist phrases. Belgrade's attacks, Cairo's slanders, and the West's hostile clamor are all directed towards a common goal: to weaken the unity between Arab countries and to set the Arab peoples against their best friends—the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

### 保“工人事业报”发表文章揭露  铁托集团奉帝国主义意旨  竭力破坏阿拉伯国家团结

    保“工人事业报”发表文章揭露
    铁托集团奉帝国主义意旨
    竭力破坏阿拉伯国家团结
    新华社索非亚15日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”14日以“谁暗中破坏阿拉伯的团结？”为题发表文章说，南斯拉夫修正主义者在阿拉伯民族解放运动中起着“特洛伊木马”的可耻作用。文章指出，最近发生的事件表明，帝国主义和反动派不仅进行污蔑宣传和恫吓，而且进行阴谋活动，直接参加组织反对伊拉克共和国的反动暴乱和挑衅。当这些阴谋遭到彻底失败后，某些人就疯狂地进行反共反苏。
    文章说，在叫嚣反对阿拉伯共产党的人们的行列中，南斯拉夫冒牌马克思主义者并不落后。贝尔格莱德修正主义者按照他们所奉行的分裂主义路线，竭力企图孤立阿拉伯国家的共产党，并把他们推向所谓的“南斯拉夫道路”。而这一道路则是同苏联共产党、其他马克思列宁主义政党，以及整个国际共产主义运动对立的道路，分裂主义的道路和在各国人民最凶恶的敌人——帝国主义面前投降的道路。
    文章接着指出，阿拉伯各国共产党的坚决态度和它们之间的团结粉碎了南斯拉夫修正主义者的这种卑鄙阴谋。在复杂的环境中进行工作的阿拉伯国家的共产党是无限忠于无产阶级国际主义原则的，任何诡计没有、也绝不能把它们推向危险的歧途。这就大大激怒了贝尔格莱德的修正主义者。于是他们就公开无耻地攻击叙利亚共产党、伊拉克共产党和其他阿拉伯国家的共产党，特别是反对这些国家党的领导人。在反对阿拉伯共产党人的嚎叫声中，混杂着南共领导集团的嘶哑声音。
    文章强调指出，南斯拉夫领导集团对阿拉伯共产党人的攻击与帝国主义的造谣、诽谤之间的不同之处，仅仅在于前者蒙上了一层薄薄的面纱——马克思主义词句。贝尔格莱德的攻击、开罗的诽谤、西方的敌意叫嚣都是指向一个共同的方向：削弱阿拉伯国家之间的团结，使阿拉伯各国人民同他们的最好的朋友——苏联以及其他社会主义国家对立起来。
