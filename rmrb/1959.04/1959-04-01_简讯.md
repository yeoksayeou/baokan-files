    Mining Corundum
    Hebei Province's Ping Shan County is organizing the masses to mine corundum in large quantities. Guangyu People's Commune alone has signed a contract with relevant industrial departments in Tianjin to produce 120,000 jin of corundum.
    Corundum is an important raw material in industry used to make grinding wheels and polishing materials for precision machine parts. It is a fine ore hidden deep in the mountains.
    奇特的煤 (Qí tè de méi)
    Bizarre Coal
    The Xinqiu Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau in Liaoning Province discovered an unusual seam of coal in its new open-pit mine. It is black and shiny, light and brittle, and ignites with just a match. The soil and stones within half a meter around this coal seam also ignite easily. Initial tests show that its oil content is over 80%, and it also contains valuable carbon black and more than a dozen by-products.

    Straw Cardboard Boxes
    Employees of the Shantou Special District Confectionery and Native Products Station in Guangdong Province, without any tools or technical knowledge, used straw to manufacture a type of thick cardboard to replace wood for packaging. This cardboard is sturdy and attractive in quality and can be used not only to make boxes in place of wood, but also as soundproofing panels.

    奇异的煤
    辽宁省阜新矿务局新丘矿在新露天发现一槽少见的煤。颜色黑亮，又轻又脆，只要用火柴一点就着。在这槽煤周围半公尺以内的土和石头也一点就着。经过初步化验，它的含油量占百分之八十以上，其中还含有非常贵重的炭黑和十几种副产品。

    稻草制纸板箱
    广东省汕头专区糖果菜站和土产站的职工，在完全没有工具、不懂技术的情况下，用稻草制造了一种厚纸板代替木材作包装用。这种纸板的质量坚固美观，不但可以代替木材做箱子，而且可以做隔音板。
