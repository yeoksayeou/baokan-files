Chemical City Under the Qionglai Mountains
By Our Correspondent Li Ce

In the fields of the suburbs of Dayi County, Sichuan, stand factories producing chemical products with indigenous methods. This year, a batch of new factories are also under intensive construction. To date, the county has built ten factories, successfully trial-produced thirty-seven products, and put twenty-five into production. These include basic chemical products such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and caustic soda, as well as important chemical raw materials such as activated carbon, calcium acetate, furfural, and alcohol. There are also calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer and chlortetracycline and aureomycin for livestock production to serve agricultural production, as well as maltose and glucose, which are directly related to people's lives.

Dayi County does not have any particularly advantageous conditions for establishing a chemical industry. The county is located on the western edge of the Sichuan Plain, with crisscrossing ditches and abundant agricultural products, with an average yield of 1000 jin per mu last year. However, the foundation of local industry is quite weak. Before 1958, the chemical industry was a blank slate. However, in 1958, driven by the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the chemical industry experienced a leapfrog development. Last spring, in order to increase grain production, the county's rural areas established more than 1,200 indigenous chemical fertilizer and pesticide factories, which played a significant role in increasing grain production. However, these factories were temporary, starting work when needed and stopping production when not needed, and could not provide advanced chemical products. The county's large-scale chemical industry began in September of last year. At that time, the situation was: agriculture had a bumper harvest, requiring economical and rational processing of various agricultural and sideline products, especially the comprehensive utilization of more than 400 million jin of sweet potatoes; people's communes were developing diversified operations, requiring antimicrobial feed to promote the breeding and growth of livestock and poultry; and the entire people were engaged in large-scale steel production, urgently needing to produce sulfuric acid, caustic soda, and explosives in mining, smelting, and road construction. Finally, in order to meet the diverse needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives this year, various chemical industries must also keep up. To run the chemical industry, requesting foreign aid in terms of technology, equipment, etc., was difficult. Supply personnel traveled to major and medium-sized cities in the province, but returned empty-handed. County Party Secretary Wang Yucheng said: "This series of problems made us realize even more that we must rely on our own efforts and use indigenous methods to start the chemical industry. If we rely on large urban industries to solve the county's huge needs, it will not only increase the burden on the cities, but also put us in a more passive position." Therefore, the county party committee educated cadres to break down the mysterious view of the chemical industry and launched a movement to vigorously develop the chemical industry. At the same time, the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Chemical Industry also took Dayi County as a pilot project, sending working groups and providing strong assistance in factory design, product trial production, production technology, and personnel training.

In September of last year, under the leadership of the county party committee, Dayi County agencies, enterprises, schools, and people's organizations first used their own personnel, equipment, and funds to vigorously develop the chemical industry, in order to gain experience and popularize it in rural areas. The Bureau of Commerce established a chemical fertilizer factory to supply the countryside; the Bureau of Grain established alcohol, maltose, and glucose factories to process sweet potatoes; the County Anti-epidemic Station used its own equipment and technology to establish an aureomycin factory; the County Communist Youth League mobilized young people to establish a sulfuric acid factory; the County Women's Federation established an antibiotic factory, and so on. Without the state allocating a single yuan, ten small chemical factories were built. By the end of the year, the total output value reached more than 41,000 yuan.

These factories were all established using indigenous methods. In addition to using existing buildings, the newly built factory buildings were also entirely made of earth and wood. In the workshops, there were no machines, motors, or generators, only indigenous machines and tools made of ceramics, glass, bamboo, wood, and pig iron. Only in the electrolytic stone salt factory could one see a 0.75-kilowatt rectifier, which was the only foreign equipment. The antibiotic factory connected ceramic pipes, running them through the roof and ground of the greenhouse, and passing steam through them to replace the heating. The iron tower of the sulfuric acid factory was also connected with large ceramic tubes.

Running the factory relied on self-reliance, and technical personnel were also solved through their own efforts. The county held various chemical training classes. Some young people with primary or junior high school education, after short-term study and preliminary mastery of operating techniques, participated in factory construction and production. Yang Mingzhi, a technician at the sulfuric acid factory, was a young man from the countryside with only a primary school education. He only studied for more than ten days and attended an on-site meeting on sulfuric acid production in another place. After returning, he led people to the mountains to find minerals and participated in the design and construction of the factory, and is now responsible for the factory's production technology work. Chen Yuzhen, the director of the antibiotic factory, was originally the director of the township women's federation and only had a primary school education. She studied hard and worked hard for two months, not only mastering all the operating techniques for manufacturing chlortetracycline, but also being able to explain the production principles to visitors. The chlortetracycline produced by this factory had significant effects in promoting hair growth in pigs last winter, and nearby people's communes submitted order plans one after another, and the products were in short supply. Now, these factories have trained thirty-four technicians and more than three hundred skilled workers, establishing a technical team for the chemical industry.

Dayi County has abundant chemical industrial raw materials, and some basic raw materials are even inexhaustible. The rural areas have abundant agricultural and sideline products and wild plants, such as tubers, rice husks, corn cobs, red roots, acorns, etc., which can be used to produce a wide variety of chemical products if widely utilized. For example, Dayi County uses sweet potatoes to make alcohol, butanol, butadiene-sodium rubber, glucose, and maltose; and uses corn cobs and rice husks to make furfural. Recovering calcium acetate from charcoal kilns only requires adding a pot, a wooden bucket, and a few bamboo poles, without increasing labor, and the output value is doubled, which is equal to the cost of making charcoal. Now more than forty charcoal kilns in the county are equipped with these devices. Some factories in Chongqing have come to order them.

Now, these factories have been united into a county-owned chemical general factory, and a batch of new factories have been established. This year's output value will increase 350 times compared to last year, and major products such as acids, alkalis, and chemical fertilizers will be self-sufficient and will also be transferred out to support large cities.

Now, as pilot projects for popularizing the chemical industry to the countryside, pesticide, chlortetracycline, wood charcoal dry distillation, and alcohol factories have been established in Jinping, Heming, Xinchang, and Anren. The general factory and other chemical factories have also established cooperative relationships, such as providing semi-finished products for the general factory to process; the general factory manufactures nitric acid, which is then used by other chemical factories to produce soil nitrate; and the general factory engages in new product trial production and provides certain important raw materials. This has promoted the development of the chemical industry throughout the county.

    邛崃山下化工城
    本报记者　李策
    在四川大邑县郊区的田野，矗立着一座座用土法生产化学产品的工厂。今年还有一批新建的工厂正在加紧施工。到目前为止，全县已经建成十个厂，试制成功三十七种产品，投入生产的有二十五种。其中有硫酸、硝酸、烧碱等基本化学产品，有活性炭、醋石、糠醛、酒精等重要化工原料，还有为农业生产服务的钙镁磷肥、畜用土霉素、金霉素，也有与人民生活有直接关系的饴糖、葡萄糖。
    大邑县在建立化学工业方面并没有什么优越的条件。这个县在四川平原的西部边缘，境内沟渠交错，农产富饶，去年平均亩产千斤。地方工业的基础却相当薄弱，1958年以前，化学工业更是一张白纸。但是，在1958年，在工农业生产大跃进的带动下，化学工业有了飞跃的发展。去年春天，为了增产粮食，这个县的农村举办了一千二百多个土化肥厂和农药厂，对粮食增产起了不小的作用。可是，这些厂是带有临时性，用时开工，不用时停产，不能提供高级化学产品。全县大搞化学工业是从去年9月份开始的。当时的情况是：农业大丰收，需要经济合理地处理各种农副产品，特别是要对四亿多斤红苕进行综合利用；人民公社发展多种经营，需要促进家畜家禽繁殖和生长的抗菌饲料；全民大搞钢铁，在采矿、冶炼、修路方面，又急需生产硫酸、烧碱和炸药；最后，为了适应今年工农业生产建设和人民生活多方面的需要，各种化学工业也必须跟上去。要办化学工业，可是不论在技术、设备等任何方面，要求外援，都是困难的。供应人员走遍了省内大中城市，结果空手而回。县委书记王玉成同志说：“这一系列的问题使我们更加体会到，必须自力更生，用土办法搞起化学工业；如果依靠城市大工业来解决本县的庞大需要，不仅会加大城市的负担，而且将会使我们陷于更被动的地位。”于是，县委教育干部破除对化学工业的神秘观点，掀起了大办化学工业的运动。同时，中央化工部、四川省化工局也以大邑县作为试点，派来了工作组，并在厂房设计、产品试制、生产技术和人员培训等方面给以大力协助。
    去年9月，大邑县机关、企业、学校和人民团体在县委领导下，首先利用自己的人员、设备、资金大搞化学工业，以便摸索经验，向农村普及。商业局兴办化学肥料厂，供应农村；粮食局办了酒精、饴糖和葡萄糖厂处理红苕；县防疫站用自己的设备、技术，办了金霉素厂；县团委动员广大青年办起了硫酸厂；县妇联办了抗生素厂，等等。不用国家拨一元钱，十座小型化工厂就建设起来了。到年底，总产值达到四万一千多元。
    这些工厂都是用土办法建立的，除了利用原有的房屋以外，新建的厂房，也完全是土木建筑，在车间里看不见机器、马达、发电机，到处只是陶瓷、玻璃、竹木和生铁制成的土机器和工具。只能在电解石盐厂看见一只0.75瓩的整流器，算是唯一的一件洋设备。抗生素厂把陶管连接起来，贯穿在温室的屋顶和地面，通上蒸汽，代替了暖气。硫酸厂的铁塔也是用大型陶筒连起来的。
    办厂是自力更生，技术人员也是自寻门路解决的。县上举办了各种化工训练班，一些具有高小、初中文化程度的青年，经过短期学习，初步掌握操作技术以后，就参加建厂和生产。硫酸厂技术员杨明治是从农村来的仅有高小文化程度的青年。他只学了十几天，到外地参加了一次制硫酸的现场会议，回来就带人上山找矿，参加工厂的设计、施工，现在负责全厂的生产技术工作。抗生素厂厂长陈宇贞，原来是乡妇联主任，只有初小文化程度。她苦学苦干两个月，不仅掌握了制造土霉素的全部操作技术，而且能向参观者讲解生产的原理。这个厂的土霉素在去年冬天催毛猪方面效果显著，附近人民公社纷纷提出订货计划，产品供不应求。现在，这些厂已经培养了三十四名技术员和三百多名技术工人，建立了一支化学工业的技术队伍。
    大邑县的化学工业原料相当丰富，有些基本原料甚至是取之不尽的。农村中有丰富农副产品和野生植物，如薯类、稻谷壳、玉米心、红根、橡子，等等，如广泛加以利用，可以生产多种多样的化工产品。例如，大邑县用红苕制成酒精、丁醇、丁钠橡胶、葡萄糖、饴糖；用玉米心、稻谷壳制成了糠醛。从木炭窑里收回醋石，只是添一口锅、一个木桶、几根竹子，不增加劳动力，产值就增加一倍，等于烧木炭的成本。现在全县四十多个炭窑都安上了这些装置。重庆一些工厂已前来订购。
    现在，这些厂已经联合成为县属的化工总厂，并建立了一批新厂。今年产值将比去年增长三百五十倍，酸、碱、化学肥料等主要产品将达到自给自足，并有一部分外调，支援大城市。
    现在，作为向农村普及化学工业的试点——锦屏、鹤鸣、新场和安仁等地已建立了农药、土霉素、木炭干馏和酒精厂。总厂和其他化工厂还建立起协作关系，如给提供半成品，总厂进行加工；总厂制造硝酸就由其他化工厂生产土硝；总厂从事新产品试制，提供某些重要原料。这样就促进了全县化学工业的发展。
