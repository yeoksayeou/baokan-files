Xinhua News Agency, April 11th, Santiago dispatch: "El Siglo" published on the 10th a statement by the General Secretary of the Argentine Communist Party, Codovilla, to the newspaper's correspondent in Buenos Aires regarding the domestic situation.

　　Codovilla pointed out that the Frondizi government's current policy is anti-democratic, anti-progressive, and pro-imperialist because this policy unprecedentedly benefits big landowners, big capitalists, and foreign monopoly capital, especially American monopoly capital, while cruelly shifting the burden of the economic crisis onto the working people. Codovilla also said that if the people do not rise up in united action to stop it in time, the Frondizi government's policy will completely turn the country into a colony and cause the country to lose its political sovereignty.

　　Codovilla pointed out that since the Frondizi government implemented its economic plan, the living standards of the Argentine people have declined sharply, and the cost of living has risen sharply. The recent upsurge of large-scale strikes by the Argentine working people against the government's starvation policy and its surrender to imperialism is clear evidence of this.

　　Codovilla pointed out that despite the repression, the patriotic and democratic people's movement is still developing and growing. Currently, the Argentine government has closed down Communist Party offices in various places, as well as the "Times" and "Our Word" weekly newspapers. Codovilla pointed out that despite this, today is no longer an era of dictatorship and colonialism, and the path of the working class and progressive forces cannot be blocked. They are fighting to create a prosperous, democratic, politically and economically independent Argentina.

　　阿根廷共产党总书记论国内局势
　　阿根廷爱国民主运动风起云涌
    新华社11日讯　圣地亚哥消息：“世纪报”10日刊登了阿根廷共产党总书记柯都维亚对这一家报纸驻布宜诺斯艾利斯特派记者关于国内局势的谈话。
    柯都维亚指出，弗朗迪西政府今天的政策是反民主、反进步、亲帝国主义的政策，因为这个政策空前地有利于大地主、大资本家和外国垅断资本、特别是美国垅断资本，同时却把经济危机的重担残酷地转嫁到劳动人民的头上。柯都维亚又说，假如人民不起来一致行动，及时地加以制止的话，弗朗迪西政府的政策会使国家完全沦为殖民地，使国家丧失政治主权。
    柯都维亚指出，弗朗迪西政府推行它的经济计划以后，阿根廷人民的生活水平直线下降，生活费用直线上升。阿根廷劳动人民反对政府的饥饿政策，反对它向帝国主义投降，近来掀起了风起云涌的大罢工，就是明证。
    柯都维亚指出，尽管遭到镇压，爱国、民主的人民运动仍在发展壮大。目前，阿根廷政府封闭了各地的共产党党部，封闭了“时报”和“我们的话”周报。柯都维亚指出，尽管如此，今天已经不是独裁统治和殖民主义的时代了，工人阶级和进步力量前进的道路是堵塞不住的，他们正在为创造一个繁荣、民主、政治和经济独立的阿根廷而奋斗。
