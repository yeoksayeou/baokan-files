Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 8th: The female workers of the Clever Girls Group in the 25th Workshop of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory had completed fifteen months of work in three months and five days by April 5th. For more than three months, the whole group has basically exceeded the plan every day and increased production every month. The product qualification rate reached 99.75%, and there were no work-related injuries, making it a red banner for female worker groups and youth groups throughout the factory.

This Clever Girls Group was established in November last year. Almost all of the twenty-seven girls in the group are young people around twenty years old, most of whom were new apprentices who entered the factory in the fourth quarter of last year. The lathes they use, except for one new one, are all belt-driven lathes that are much older than they are. However, because the girls in the group work hard and constantly improve process equipment and increase production efficiency, they have been exceeding the state plan every ten days and every month since the beginning of this year.

In the vigorous technical revolution movement this year, this group has implemented more than 4,300 innovation proposals of all sizes, of which 434 are important. All of their lathes have implemented multi-tool, multi-edge, and multi-chuck operations, so one lathe can do the work of several. After many processing methods have been tested, researched, and innovated, the work efficiency has been significantly improved. According to the original processing method, it took two days to turn a "handle". In March, with the help of experienced workers, the girls used a flat arc broach to clear the corners and extended the tap head for processing, and each "handle" only took fifty minutes to turn.

In February and March, the Clever Girls Group also designed and used waste materials to make homemade lathes, broaching machines, tapping machines, punching dies and other equipment, which improved the group's equipment processing capabilities. For example, it was very inefficient to turn tenons on a lathe, but now using a specially made broaching machine, the work efficiency has increased by 1,200 times. Due to the increased equipment capacity, the number of work hours completed by the group each month is several times greater than the planned work hours.

While vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, the Clever Girls Group also seriously carried out intra-group and extra-group competitions and evaluations, which made everyone's enthusiasm for work more and more vigorous. These competitions included "Thousand Minutes" competitions and "Five Goods" (good quality, high output, good safety, good shift handover, good unity and mutual assistance), and "Three Quicks" (quick to discover problems, quick to solve problems, quick to learn from the advanced). In these competition activities, they conscientiously checked every day, evaluated every week, and evaluated every month, which greatly promoted production. After the group launched the "Thousand Minutes" competition in March, more than 80% of the girls reached the "Thousand Minutes" target, thus completing the entire month's task in sixteen days.

Currently, this group is further improving labor organization and production technology with a spirit of continuous leap forward. They have implemented the "three fix" method of fixed machine tools, fixed personnel, and fixed tasks in April. Doing so will motivate everyone to better study technology and improve work efficiency. Because there are many types of products and the quality requirements are getting higher and higher, the entire group is launching an activity in which everyone designs and manufactures native-made templates, so that each product has a template for inspection to improve the qualification rate of product parts.

    巧姑娘小组事事巧
    三个月零五天完成十五个月的工作量
    据新华社重庆8日电　重庆建设机床厂二十五车间巧姑娘小组的全体女工，到4月5日止，已在三个月零五天的时间里完成了十五个月的工作量。三个多月来全组基本上做到天天超额完成计划，月月生产加番；产品合格率达到99.75％，没有发生任何工伤事故，成为全厂女工小组和青年小组的一面红旗。
    这个巧姑娘小组是去年11月成立的，全组二十七个姑娘差不多全是二十岁上下的年轻人，大部分是去年第四季度才进厂的新学工。她们使用的车床除了一部是新的以外，其余都是比她们年龄大得多的皮带车床。但是，由于全组姑娘在苦干的同时，不断改进工艺设备，提高生产效率，今年以来一直是按旬按月地超额完成国家计划。
    这个小组今年在大闹技术革命运动中，已经实现了大大小小的革新建议四千三百多项，其中重要的有四百三十四项。她们的全部车床都实行了多刀、多刃和多卡活，因而一部车床能顶几部用。许多加工方法经过试验研究加以革新以后，工效显著提高。按原来的加工方法车制“手柄”，要两天才能车一根。3月份姑娘们在老师傅帮助下，采用平面弧型绞刀清角和把丝攻头接长的方法进行加工，每根“手柄”只要五十分钟就车出来了。
    巧姑娘小组在2、3两月份还自己设计和利用废旧料制成了土元车、轧梢机、攻丝机、冲模等设备，提高了全组设备加工能力。例如原来在车床上车梢子，效率很低，现在用专门制造的轧梢机轧，工效提高了一千二百倍。由于增加了设备能力，全组每月完成的工时要比计划工时大好几倍。
    在大闹技术革命同时，巧姑娘小组又认真展开了组内和组外的竞赛评比，使大家的劳动热情越来越旺盛。这些竞赛包括“千分钟”竞赛和“五好”（质量好、产量高、安全好、交接班好、团结互助好）、“三快”（发现问题快、解决问题快、学习先进快）的活动。她们在这些竞赛活动中，认真做到了天天检查，周周评比，月月评比，因此大大推动了生产。3月份全组开展“千分钟”竞赛活动后，有80％以上的姑娘达到了“千分钟”的指标，因而十六天就完成了全月任务。
    目前，这个小组正以不断跃进的精神，进一步改进劳动组织和生产技术。她们4月份已经实行了定机床、定人、定任务的“三定”办法。这样做会发动大家更好地钻研技术，提高工效。由于产品种类多，质量要求愈来愈高，全组正在掀起一个人人设计制造土样板的活动，使每种产品都有样板用来检查，以提高产品零件的合格率。（附图片）
