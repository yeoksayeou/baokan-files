Heighten Vigilance and Strictly Prevent Wheat from Frost Damage
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute
According to reports from our comrades working in the field, this year's wheat is mostly growing strong. In the main wheat-producing areas, wheat has entered the stages of jointing, booting, and heading. Everywhere is lush green, and a bumper harvest is expected. During this period, in addition to doing everything possible to prevent wheat lodging, close attention must also be paid to the occurrence of frost. According to predictions, the spring cold may be longer this year, and the possibility of frost is greater. In recent years, through practical experience and observation summaries in various places on frost prevention, there is now a clearer understanding of frost damage knowledge and prevention and remedial measures. Here, we briefly present them for reference.

General Laws of Frost Occurrence

I. Occurrence of Frost: Cold high-pressure air masses move southward from Siberia or Mongolia. During movement, the northerly wind strengthens. When the center of the cold high pressure reaches a location, if the wind weakens, the sky is clear, and the ground radiation cooling effect is strong at night, the temperature drops sharply below zero degrees Celsius, which can cause frost damage to crops that have been growing in warm conditions. Frost appearing on the leaves is called white frost, and damage from low temperatures without frost on the leaves is called black frost. Black frost damage is often more severe.

To prevent frost, it is necessary to correctly judge frost conditions and pay close attention to the frost forecasts from weather stations. When the evening sky is clear, and there is no wind, frost is most likely to occur, and proactive defense should be taken.

II. Time of Harmful Late Frost in China and Areas Where Wheat is More Affected: Except for warmer areas such as valleys and plains in South China and Southwest China where low temperatures in February can harm wheat, the severe frosts that have occurred in recent years include the following: On April 12, 1953, the temperature dropped to minus four degrees Celsius (Linfen), and the affected area spread to southern Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui. On April 20, 1954, the temperature dropped to minus five point eight degrees Celsius (Linfen), and the affected area spread to southern Shanxi, southern Hebei, and northern Henan. The frost that occurred on May 3, 1955, only slightly damaged central Shanxi due to the weaker cold air. Judging from the laws of frost damage, frost in mid-to-late April is the most dangerous. At this time, wheat in the main wheat-producing areas in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins has entered the booting stage and requires a higher temperature of over ten degrees Celsius. Low temperatures can adversely affect wheat, and special vigilance should be raised to prevent frost damage.

III. Critical Temperature for Frost Damage and Sensitive Period for Wheat: Because of differences in the intensity, migration route, and speed of cold high pressure, differences in ground properties, and differences in the developmental stage of wheat in the north and south of China, as well as differences in wheat varieties, the degree of frost damage varies greatly from place to place. Based on our observations in a wide area in 1953 and 1954, when the temperature in the Stevenson screen drops to minus four degrees Celsius at night, due to strong ground and leaf radiation cooling, the low temperature on the side of the wheat leaves can reach minus ten degrees Celsius. If the Stevenson screen temperature drops to zero degrees Celsius at 10 PM, and the sub-zero temperature lasts for more than seven hours, the ground plants of wheat can be completely frozen to death. If the degree of low temperature is the same, but the sub-zero temperature only lasts for about three hours, then only wheat in unfavorable terrain will be damaged. If the Stevenson screen temperature only drops to minus two degrees Celsius, although the duration of sub-zero temperatures is longer, the ground plants will not be completely frozen to death, and only the leaves or exposed spikelets will be slightly damaged. In the early stage of wheat jointing, although the frost resistance is weaker than before jointing, the above low temperatures can only damage the tip of the leaves. Our preliminary observation results show that the critical temperature for severe wheat damage is around minus three degrees Celsius in the Stevenson screen, and the duration of low temperature is three to five hours. The most sensitive period for wheat damage is from booting to flowering.

IV. Different Terrain Conditions and Agricultural Techniques Can Affect the Degree of Wheat Damage: Farmers have long had the saying "Wind hits the mountain ridges, frost hits the depressions." The severely affected areas in Shanxi Province in 1953 and 1954 were all in the Fen River basin in southwestern Shanxi. In 1954, a survey in the old Fencheng County showed that the wheat in the mountainous area along the Gushe Mountains in the northwest of the county had almost no frost damage; the terrain in Lidun and Bei Lier villages in the north was higher, with 33% damage; the urban area was lower, with 42%-72% damage; and the eastern and southern villages, such as Dongbao, Zhao Kang, and Bei Zhong, which were the lowest, suffered 95% damage. In the same year, another survey in Linfen showed that wheat on the top of a two-zhang high peak suffered 7.1% damage, while the two depressions between the two peaks suffered 78% and 81% damage respectively. This is because cold air is not easy to accumulate at the high altitude of the peak, but gradually settles in low-lying areas, so the latter suffers more damage.

In addition, wheat in the leeward area in front of the village and under the trees, on the side of lakes and seas, and on moist land is also less affected.

In terms of agricultural technology: the selection of varieties has a significant impact on frost damage. Varieties that start growing later are often less affected by frost than varieties that start growing earlier; late sowing is less affected by frost than early sowing; and wheat that has been rolled before jointing is less affected than wheat that has not been rolled.

In short, the degree of frost damage depends on the degree of low temperature and the duration of the low temperature, and also depends on the developmental stage of the wheat. When wheat enters the most sensitive period for frost damage, from booting to flowering, it is most susceptible to damage when encountering frost of greater intensity and longer duration.

Frost Can Be Prevented

I. Irrigation Method: Increasing soil moisture can raise the temperature near the plants, so irrigating wheat fields before frost occurs is extremely effective in preventing frost damage. Wheat fields that were irrigated in 1953 and 1954 suffered significantly less damage than those that were not irrigated. We suggest that in areas prone to frost damage, the wheat fields be thoroughly irrigated once during the booting stage. In the North China Plain, this is the time when wheat itself needs the most water, so irrigation can kill two birds with one stone.

II. Smudging Method: Smudging can cover crops with dense smoke to reduce heat loss from the ground. This is an effective frost prevention method that Chinese farmers have used for a long time. Three to four smoke piles should be placed per mu, each pile accumulating about a hundred catties of smoke-producing material. The smoke pile can be placed in a container, or built on the ground with bricks, or half-exposed on the ground, or dug in the ground. This can make the smoke screen lower. The smoke piles should be lit when the temperature drops to close to zero degrees Celsius. The smoke piles should be tight, dense, and appropriately moist to avoid burning too quickly. A dense smoke screen must be maintained until after the sun comes out the next morning. Smoke-producing materials can be obtained locally, such as straw, leaves, dead branches, weeds, and garbage (frost prevention smudging can also be combined with manure accumulation). The smudging container has a small mouth and a large bottom. Generally, the diameter of the smoke outlet at the upper end is about one chi, the diameter of the bottom is about one chi and five cun, and the depth is about one chi and yu. A ventilation hole is left on the side for ignition and adding fuel. After the fuel is piled up, a smoke outlet of about three cun is left in the middle, and the upper part is tightly sealed with wet soil.

A smoke stove made of gasoline drums, with three or four smoke pipes at the top and an air inlet at the bottom, and other stove devices, can be placed on a wheeled cart and pushed to the upwind location for smudging when frost occurs. This can save fuel, produce good smoke, and be easy to move.

Smudging is an effective frost prevention measure, but it requires a lot of materials and the technology is more complicated. It should be handled by designated personnel and cannot be done simply. According to past experience, if the smoke screen is not produced well, or the smudging time is too short, the effect will not be great, and manpower and material resources will be wasted.

III. Spraying Method: When frost is likely to occur, spraying fine water droplets on the wheat plants with various spraying equipment can reduce frost damage. During the frosty night, continuous spraying should be carried out, and the plants should be kept moist until sunrise to increase the temperature near the wheat plants.

IV. Soil Mulching Method: According to experiments by the former East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, mulching the wheat roots with fine soil can effectively reduce frost damage and prevent lodging. The soil mulching material can be mixed with farmyard manure, plant ash, and wheat bran, which can also act as topdressing.

V. Upper Covering Method: For small-area satellite fields, in order to completely avoid frost damage, it can be combined with tying anti-lodging frames, making the frames slightly higher than the wheat plants, and covering them with straw curtains before frost occurs. Remove them after sunrise the next day. In an emergency, oilcloth, bed sheets, etc. can be used to cover them. The covering should not be too heavy to avoid breaking the wheat stalks.

Among the above frost prevention measures, the most significant effect is the irrigation method, which should be used as the main measure for frost prevention in the future, because it can not only be combined with the needs of wheat growth, but also can be widely promoted in various places. Although the effect of the soil mulching method is not as good as the former, its main purpose is to effectively prevent wheat lodging, which is a very suitable measure at present.

Actively Process and Salvage After Frost

After wheat has been frosted, it will be damaged to some extent. In areas with particularly severe frost or unfavorable terrain, the damage may be great. According to our observations, the upper plants, where the temperature drops and rises sharply during frost, often cannot withstand it and die. However, the ground temperature does not change much, so the underground wheat tillering nodes and roots are not damaged. Wheat is also a plant with strong regeneration ability. After the original stalks are frozen to death, if fertilizer and water are sufficiently supplied, the original small tillers or dormant buds can still grow rapidly. In Linfen in 1954, it was observed that after cultivation, new tillers of frosted wheat could grow 2.8 centimeters per day, and these tillers had passed the vernalization stage and could normally head and bear grain. Although the spikes of the new tillers are smaller and mature later, the number is often more than the original tillers. After sufficient fertilization, irrigation, and weeding, the original yield can be restored to about 70%; the recovery is poorer if the fertility is poorer. Therefore, after wheat is frozen, you must not relax or turn over the land and replant. You should actively encourage the masses to work hard and carry out a post-frost fertilization, irrigation, processing, and weeding campaign, so that a bumper harvest can still be achieved.

After freezing, some people cut off the dead seedlings. According to observations, the spikes of new tillers that are not cut off are larger and the grains are fuller. This may be because the old tillers can protect the growth of the new tillers. Cutting can cause a large amount of water to evaporate from the cut, and at the same time, cutting can cut off some of the new buds and damage the wheat roots. Therefore, it is better not to cut them.

    提高警惕，严防小麦受霜冻
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    根据本所在外工作同志报告，今年各地小麦绝大部分生长健壮，主要产麦区的小麦已分别进入拔节孕穗露苞时期，到处一片葱绿，丰收有望。这个期间，除了千方百计防止小麦倒伏以外，还要严密注意发生霜冻。根据预测，今年春寒可能较长，发生霜冻的可能性较大。几年来，通过各地对防止霜冻的实践及观察总结，对霜害知识及预防补救方法已有较明确的认识，这里简要提出以供参考。
    霜冻发生的一般规律
    一、霜冻的发生　冷高压气团由西伯利亚或蒙古向南移动。在移动时北风增强。当冷高压中心到了一个地方以后，若是风力减弱，天晴无云，夜间地面辐射冷却作用强烈，气温骤降到零度以下，对已在温暖条件下生长的作物即能发生冻害。叶面上现霜的叫白霜，叶面上并不见霜而受低温为害的叫黑霜。黑霜危害往往更为严重。
    预防霜冻，必须对霜冻进行正确判断，要密切注意气象站的霜冻预报。在晚间晴空万里、寂静无风时，最易发生霜冻，应积极进行防御。
    二、我国发生有害晚霜的时间及小麦受害较多的地区　除华南西南山谷平原较温暖地带2月低温能为害小麦外，最近数年发生的严重霜冻有这几次：1953年的4月12日，温度降到摄氏零下四度（临汾），为害区域波及晋南、河南、山东及苏北、皖北一带。1954年的4月20日，温度降到摄氏零下五点八度（临汾），为害波及晋南、冀南、豫北一带。1955年5月3日发生的霜冻，因寒流较弱，只山西中部略有损害。根据霜害规律来看，4月中下旬的霜冻最为危险。此时黄河及长江流域一带小麦主要产区的小麦已进入孕穗阶段，需要有摄氏十度以上的较高温度，低温会使小麦遭受不利影响，应特别提高警惕，预防霜害。
    三、霜冻为害的临界温度及小麦受害敏感时期　因为冷高压强度、移行路线及速度的不同，地面性质的差异，以及我国南北小麦所处发育时期的不同，小麦品种的不同，各地霜冻为害程度有很大的差别。我们根据1953、1954两年在广大地区的观察，夜间百叶箱内温度降到摄氏零下四度的时候，因地面和叶面辐射冷却强烈，麦叶侧低温可能达到摄氏零下十度。若晚间十点钟百叶箱温度即降到摄氏零度，零下温度持续七小时以上时，小麦地面植株能全部冻死。低温程度相等，但零下温度只持续三小时左右，则只有不利地势的小麦受损伤。若百叶箱温度只降低到摄氏零下二度，虽零下持续时间较长，地面植株不致完全冻死，仅叶部或已露穗小花受些损害。在小麦拔节初期，抗冻力虽弱于拔节前，但以上低温只能损伤叶尖。我们初步观察结果，小麦严重为害的临界温度为百叶箱内摄氏零下三度左右，低温持续时间为三至五小时。小麦受害最敏感时期是打苞到开花期间。
    四、不同的地势条件及农业技术可影响小麦受害程度　农民很早就有“风打山梁霜打洼”的谚语，山西省1953、1954两年的受害严重区域都在晋西南汾河流域盆地。1954年在旧汾城县调查，县西北为姑射山脉，沿山地带小麦几无霜害；北部理墩、北李二村地势较高，受害33％；城区较低，受害42％—72％；东南部最低的东堡、赵康、北众等村受害达95％。同年另在临汾调查，在二丈高的峰顶上小麦受害为7.1％，两峰之间的两个洼地则分别为78％及81％。这是因为在峰顶高处冷空气不易积留，而逐渐沉积在低洼地区，所以后者受害严重。
    此外，在村前背风地带和树下，在湖海边侧及湿润土地上，空气里的小麦受害也较轻。
    在农业技术方面：选用品种对冻害有显著的影响，起身较晚的品种，常较起身早的品种受霜冻轻；播种迟的冻害较早播的为轻；拔节以前镇压过的比未经镇压的受害较轻。
    总而言之，霜冻为害程度，一方面决定于低温程度及持续时间，另一方面也决定于小麦所处的发育时期。当小麦进入对冻害最敏感的打苞到开花时期，遇到强度较大、持续时间较长的霜冻，最易受害。
      霜冻是可以预防的
    一、灌水法　土壤水分增多，可以提高植株附近温度，所以在霜冻发生前进行麦田灌溉，对预防霜害极为有效。1953及1954两年灌溉麦田较不灌溉的受害显著减轻。我们建议在霜害较易发生地区，在小麦孕穗期间饱灌一水。华北平原一带，这时候正是小麦本身需水最殷切的时候，灌水可以一举两得。
    二、熏烟法　熏烟可以在农作物表面笼罩浓密烟幕，以减少地面散失热度，这是我国农民长久以来的防霜有效方法。每亩须堆置三至四个烟堆，每堆堆积发烟材料百斤左右。烟堆可放一容器内，或用砖砌在地面，或半露地面，或在地下挖穴，这样可以使烟幕低一些。烟堆的点燃应在气温降低到接近摄氏零度时开始。烟堆要紧要密要适当湿润，以免燃烧过快。要不断保持浓密烟幕直到翌晨太阳出来以后。发烟材料可就地取材，秸秆、树叶、枯枝、杂草、垃圾屑都可以（防霜熏烟还可以结合积肥）。熏烟容器口小底大，一般上端出烟孔直径约一尺，底直径约一尺五，深约一尺余。侧面再留一通气孔道，并作点火及添燃料之用。燃料堆积后中留约三寸的出烟孔道，上部用湿土糊严。
    用汽油桶制成熏烟炉，上部装三、四个出烟筒，下部有进风口，其余如炉子装置，放在有轮车上，可在霜冻发生时推到上风地点熏烟，能节省燃料，出烟良好并移动方便。
    熏烟法是有效的防霜措施，但费料较多，技术比较复杂，应指定专人掌握，不能简单从事。根据以往经验，凡烟幕产生不好，或熏烟时间过短效果都不大，同时也浪费了人力物力。
    三、喷雾法　在霜冻可能发生的时候，用各种喷雾设备，在麦株上喷以细小水珠，可减轻冻害。在霜冻发生的夜间应不断喷射，在日出以前都保持湿润状态，可提高麦株附近温度。
    四、地面培土法　根据前华东农业科学研究所试验，在小麦根部培以细土，可有效减轻霜害，同时能防止倒伏。培土材料可掺用厩肥、草木灰及麦糠等，同时可以起追肥的作用。
    五、上部覆盖法　小面积卫星田，为了完全不受霜害，可结合扎防倒伏架子，使架子略高于麦株，在霜冻发生前用草帘盖好，到次日日出后取去。在紧急情况下，可利用油布、被单等加以复盖，复盖物不宜过重，以免压断小麦茎秆。
    以上各种防霜措施，效果最显著的是灌水法，这应该作为今后预防霜冻的主要措施，因为它不仅可以结合小麦生长需要来进行，而且有条件在各地普遍推广。培土法的效果虽不如前者，但除防霜冻外，更主要的是它可以有效地防止小麦倒伏，这在目前是一个非常适宜的措施。
    霜冻后要积极加工挽救
    小麦经过霜冻以后，多少受些损伤，霜冻特殊严重或地势不利地区可能受害很大。根据我们观察，发生霜冻时气温下降和上升剧烈的上部植株常不能忍受而死去。但地温则变化不大，因此地下的小麦分蘖节及根部都不受损伤。小麦又是再生力强的植物。原有茎秆冻死后，若肥水供应充分，原来的小蘖或潜伏芽还能迅速生长。1954年在临汾观察，受冻小麦经过培育，新分蘖每日能生长二点八厘米，而且这种分蘖都已通过春化阶段，可以正常出穗结实。新生分蘖穗子虽较小，成熟虽较迟，但数目常较原有分蘖还多。在充分施肥灌水锄地之后，可以恢复到原来产量的七成左右；肥力较差的恢复也就较差。因此小麦遭冻后决不可以松劲，也不必翻地另种，应积极鼓起群众干劲，大搞冻后施肥灌水加工锄地运动，这样仍能取得丰收。
    冻后死苗，群众有割去的，根据观察结果，不割的新蘖穗子较大，粒子较饱。可能由于旧分蘖可保护新分蘖的生长，割口能引起水分大量蒸发，同时割时能将一部分新芽割去，并损伤麦根。所以以不割为好。
