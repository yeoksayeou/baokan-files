Pyongyang dispatch from our newspaper on the 10th – The Korean working class, advancing at a gallop on the "Chollima" (Thousand-Li Horse), has launched a widespread technical innovation movement this year to fulfill the production increase target of doubling industrial output. This movement includes the application and promotion of advanced technologies and work methods, improving equipment utilization rates, and implementing mechanization and automation. The technical innovation movement has driven the rapid development of production in various industrial sectors.

Steelworkers are actively striving to shorten smelting times and reduce utilization coefficients to produce more than twice as much steel this year as last year. The "Chollima" work team of No. 3 electric furnace at the Kangson Steel Plant adopted six or seven rationalization proposals in the first quarter of this year, extending the life of the furnace roof and improving the charging process, reducing the average smelting time per furnace in the first quarter to about seven hours, nearly three hours shorter than the average smelting time per furnace for the entire last year. Workers at the other four electric furnaces at the Kangson Steel Plant are now learning from the "Chollima" work team. The No. 1 blast furnace of the Hwanghae Iron Works, which only went into production on "May Day" last year, has achieved a daily output of more than 700 tons through the workers' diligent research. They are striving to increase this to 850 tons per day before "August 15th," reducing the blast furnace utilization coefficient to below 0.6.

A high-speed tunneling movement of digging 100 meters per month is being enthusiastically carried out in various coal mines. At the Aoji Coal Mine, one of Korea's largest anthracite producing areas, eleven advanced teams exceeded the target of digging 100 meters per month in March. The Kugane Coal Mine adopted advanced hydraulic mining methods, increasing work efficiency by two times. The coal miners are determined to produce 1.6 times more coal this year than last year.

The high-speed cutting movement of cutting 100 meters per minute launched by workers in various machinery factories has created a lively scene. At the Heechon Machine Tool Plant, Korea's largest machine tool plant, the average cutting speed of each lathe has now reached more than 90 meters. Turners Kim Sang-won and Park Kye-chun have increased the cutting speed to more than 125 meters after manufacturing more than 40 kinds of new gauges. The workers at this factory are full of confidence in completing a production task this year equal to three times that of last year. Workers in various machinery factories have also demonstrated their creativity, designing and manufacturing many simple lathes themselves. The Deokcheon Automobile Factory recently manufactured more than 30 such lathes. Currently, the factory's production capacity has reached more than five times that of the same period last year.

Workers in various textile factories in Korea are making their machines run faster in order to provide each person in northern Korea with 20 meters of cloth this year. The 2,000 looms at the Pyongyang Textile Factory have now increased their speed from 180 to 190 revolutions per minute last year to the current 212 to 220 revolutions per minute. Each weaver in the factory's No. 1 weaving workshop now weaves one and a half times more cloth than in September last year. The factory's spinning workers are also not lagging behind, increasing the speed of the spindles by 150 revolutions per minute compared to last year, producing more cotton yarn.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th – The Korean Central News Agency reported today that Korea achieved great success in industrial production in the first quarter of this year. According to data provided by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Korean State Planning Commission, the gross industrial output value in the first quarter of this year increased by 80% compared to the same period last year. Judging from the production situation in the first quarter, Korea's industrial sector is expected to complete the First Five-Year Plan two years and four months ahead of schedule before the 14th anniversary of Korea's liberation on "August 15th" this year.

The growth rates of the output of various important industrial products in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year are as follows: milled iron increased by 2.3 times; steel 33%; steel products 23%; bituminous coal 59%; anthracite 47%; metal-cutting machine tools 2.2 times; chemical fertilizers 36%; cement 100%; cotton fabrics 20%; silk fabrics 62%; and rayon 1.2 times.

The report said that this tremendous achievement was achieved by the entire working people of Korea under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, launching a collective technical innovation movement. Currently, all employees in the industrial sector are responding to the call of the February Plenary Session of the Labor Party Central Committee and launching a new innovation movement and production increase competition to improve product quality and welcome "May Day."

　　争取今年工业生产翻一番
　　朝鲜工人大搞技术革新运动
    第一季度工业总产值比去年同期增长了80％
    本报平壤10日电　跨上“千里马”飞步前进的朝鲜工人阶级，今年为了完成使工业生产提高一倍的增产目标，广泛地展开了技术革新运动。这个运动的内容包括运用和推广先进技术、先进工作法，提高设备利用率，实行机械化、自动化等。技术革新运动推动了各个工业部门的生产迅速发展。
    钢铁工人为了在今年生产比去年多一倍多的钢铁，正积极为缩短冶炼时间、降低利用系数而斗争。降仙炼钢厂三号电炉“千里马”作业班，今年第一季度采纳了六、七件合理化建议，延长了炉顶寿命，改进了装料工序，使第一季度平均每炼一炉钢的时间缩短到七小时左右，比去年全年平均炼一炉钢的时间缩短了将近三小时，现在降仙炼钢厂的其他四个电炉的工人正在向
  “千里马”作业班看齐。去年“五一”节才投入生产的黄海制铁所的第一号高炉，经过工人们的苦心钻研，现在日产量已达七百吨以上。他们正争取在“八·一五”以前提高到日产八百五十吨，使高炉利用系数降低到零点六以下。
    在各个煤矿中正热烈开展每月掘进一百公尺的高速度掘进运动。朝鲜最大的烟煤产地之一的阿吾地煤矿，在3月份有十一个先进小组突破了每月掘进一百公尺的指标。古干原煤矿采用了先进的水力采煤法，工作效率提高了两倍。煤矿工人们决心要在今年生产比去年多一点六倍的煤。
    各机械厂的工人们所展开的每分钟切削一百公尺的高速度切削运动，形成热火朝天的景象。朝鲜最大的机床厂——熙川机床厂现在平均每个车床的切削速度已达到九十公尺以上。旋工金尚元、朴桂椿两人在制造了四十多种新量具后，把切削速度提高到一百二十五公尺以上。这个厂的工人对于今年将完成等于去年三倍的生产任务满怀信心。各机械厂的工人还发挥创造精神，自己设计和制造了许多简易车床，德川汽车厂最近就制造了三十多台这种车床。目前，这个工厂的生产能力已达到去年同时期的五倍以上。
    朝鲜各纺织工厂的工人为了今年使朝鲜北部每人有二十公尺布，正在使机器转动得更快。平壤纺织工厂的两千台织布机，现在每分钟的转速已由去年的一百八十到一百九十转提高到目前的二百一十二到二百二十转。这个厂的第一织布厂每个织布工现在织的布比去年9月增加了一倍半。这个厂的纺纱工也不落后，他们使纱锭的转速比去年提高了一百五十转，生产了更多的棉纱。
    新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜中央通讯社今天报道，朝鲜今年第一季度的工业生产取得了很大的成就。据朝鲜国家计划委员会中央统计局提供的资料，今年第一季度的工业总产值比去年同期增长了80％。从第一季度的生产情况看来，朝鲜的工业部门可望在今年“八一五”朝鲜解放十四周年纪念日以前，提前二年四个多月完成第一个五年计划。
    今年第一季度各重要工业产品的产量比去年同期增长的比例如下：铣铁增长了二点三倍；钢33％；钢材23％；烟煤59％；无烟煤47％；金属切削机床二点二倍；化学肥料36％；水泥一倍；棉织品20％；丝织品62％和人造丝一点二倍。
    报道说，这个巨大的成就是朝鲜全体劳动人民在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的英明领导下，展开集体技术革新运动而取得的。现在工业部门的全体职工正响应劳动党中央2月全会的号召，为提高产品的质量，为迎接“五一”节而展开新的革新运动和增产竞赛。
