    Improving Commodity Packaging
    By a People's Daily Commentator

    People need clothes, and commodities need packaging. Some packaging, like clothing, mainly serves a protective function. Packaging also has its unique functions, such as facilitating transportation, sales, storage, and use. Medicines cannot leave the factory without packaging; it would be difficult to transport grain from rural areas to cities without sacks; how would consumers take sugar home from stores if it weren't packaged? Packaging may seem like a small matter, but it is an indispensable condition for the circulation of many commodities. Poor packaging can lead to losses, especially for export commodities, where packaging quality is even more crucial.

    Packaging requires packaging materials. Among these, sacks, wrapping paper, wooden boxes, bamboo baskets, iron drums, and glass bottles are the most widely used, along with some specialized packaging supplies. In recent years, along with the development of industrial and agricultural production, the output of packaging materials in our country has also greatly increased. Last year, the national output of sacks increased by 38% compared to 1957. However, due to the Great Leap Forward in production, commodity output has increased rapidly, and the supply of certain packaging materials is relatively insufficient. This to some extent hinders the circulation of commodities. To ensure that commodities can be shipped from factories quickly and are not damaged during transportation and storage, relevant departments in all regions need to pay attention to the issue of commodity packaging.

    Solving the problem of packaging materials requires a three-pronged approach: arranging production, organizing recycling, and using them rationally.

    Properly arranging the production of packaging materials is the key to solving the problem of commodity packaging. Relevant departments in all regions should arrange the production and supply of packaging materials in a unified manner while arranging commodity production. Factories responsible for producing large quantities of packaging materials should fully utilize the capacity of existing equipment and strive to increase production. Those factories that previously produced packaging materials but "switched to other industries" last year should quickly "return to their posts" and resume production of their original products as needed. The production of packaging supplies such as bamboo, wicker, reeds, grass, ceramics, and native paper, which fall within the scope of agricultural and sideline production, should be incorporated into the production plans of the people's communes; commercial departments should encourage people's communes to increase the production of woven goods through contracts and other means. Commercial departments should make overall arrangements for the packaging supplies they need and incorporate them into the national plan through the commercial authorities.

    Doing a good job in recycling used packaging materials is also very important. We can usually see many empty bottles, cans, boxes, etc., in government offices, enterprises, and residents' homes. As long as commercial departments strengthen their procurement efforts, these used packaging supplies can be collected and transformed from useless to useful.

    Reasonably improving commodity packaging is also a good way to solve the problem of packaging materials. Relevant departments in all regions should launch mass technical innovations while ensuring that commodities are not damaged or deteriorated, and use methods of conservation and substitution to enable the same packaging materials to play a greater role. Commercial departments should also cooperate with railway departments to vigorously promote "container" transportation methods, in order to save packaging materials and reduce transportation resources.

    改进商品包装
    本报评论员
    人需要穿衣服，商品需要包装。包装的效用有的像穿衣服一样，主要为了起保护作用，包装也有它独特的作用，是为了运输、销售存放和使用的方便。药品不包装就不能出厂；粮食如果没有麻袋，很难从农村运进城市；砂糖不包装起来，消费者怎么从商店拿回家去？包装看来事小，但它是很多商品在流通中不可缺少的条件。并且商品如果包装得很不好，就会受到损失。尤其是出口商品，更要注意包装质量。
    要包装就要有包装材料。包装材料当中，麻袋、包装纸、木箱、席篓、铁桶、玻璃瓶等用途最广，另外还有些特殊的包装用品。几年来，随着工农业生产的发展，我国包装材料的产量也大大增加。去年全国麻袋的产量，就比1957年增长了38％。但是由于生产大跃进，商品产量增加很快，某些包装用品相对地感到供应不足。这在一定程度上妨碍着商品的流转。为了使商品能迅速出厂，并在运输和存放中不受损失，各地有关部门需要重视商品包装问题。
    解决包装材料要三管齐下：安排生产，组织回收，合理使用。
    妥善安排包装材料的生产，是解决商品包装问题的关键。各地有关部门在安排商品生产的同时，要统一安排包装材料的生产和供应工作。负责生产大宗包装材料的工厂，应该充分发挥现有设备的能力，努力增加生产。那些过去生产包装材料、去年“转业”的工厂，应该根据需要迅速“归队”，恢复生产原来的产品。属于农副业生产范围的竹、荆、苇、草、陶瓷、土纸等包装用品的生产，应该纳入人民公社的生产计划之内；商业部门要通过合同制等，促使人民公社增产编织物品。商业系统需要的包装用品，应该由自己统筹安排，并通过商业主管部门纳入国家计划。
    做好旧包装用品的回收工作，也很重要。平常我们可以看到在机关、企业和居民家中，都有不少空瓶、空罐、空箱等等，只要商业部门加强收购，便可以把这些旧包装用品收集起来，变无用为有用。
    合理地改进商品包装，也是解决包装材料问题的好办法。各地有关部门应该在保证商品不损坏、不变质的前提下，发动群众大搞技术革命，用节约、代用的办法，让同样的包装材料发挥更大的作用。商业部门还应该同铁路部门协作，大力推行“集装箱”运输方法，以便节约包装材料，节省运输力量。
