Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 10th. Pabała Gélig Namgyai, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, presented a written report at the plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee on the 8th. The full text is as follows:

　　Acting Chairman, Vice Chairmen, Members, Comrades:

　　Yesterday, after I saw the notice of the convocation of the plenary meeting of the committee, I felt particularly happy. However, due to my poor health and being ill, I cannot personally attend this grand meeting, and I feel deeply sorry. I fully agree with the five proposals to be discussed and adopted at this meeting, and I wholeheartedly support the order of the State Council.
    For the past eight years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Chinese Communist Party and the central government have been very concerned about the progress and development of Tibet and have given great help in many ways. As a result, Tibet's political, economic, and cultural construction has made certain progress, and the lives of the Tibetan people have begun to improve. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet and the working personnel entering Tibet have faithfully implemented the Chinese Communist Party and the central government's ethnic policies and religious freedom policies, as well as the Seventeen-Article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, thereby greatly strengthening the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities and enhancing the patriotic ideology of the Tibetan people. However, the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, in order to maintain their ruling position of oppressing the working people, and under the pretext of protecting religious and national interests, colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionary forces to carry out armed rebellion, attempting to place the Tibetan people back under the dark rule of imperialism and its running dogs. In the past, the central government, with a broad-minded attitude, repeatedly urged the Tibetan local government to severely punish the rebels and maintain social order. However, the Tibetan local government disobeyed in secret, not only failing to take responsibility for quelling the rebellion but also condoning and supporting it, thereby fueling the arrogance of the rebels. On March 10th, it further joined forces with the rebels, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, brazenly betrayed the motherland, undermined unity, and openly launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa on the night of March 19th. All their actions are fundamentally contrary to the will of the Tibetan people, thus arousing great indignation and strong opposition from the monks and laypeople of Tibet. On March 28th, the State Council ordered the dissolution of the rebellious Tibetan local government, the exercise of the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the complete suppression of the rebellion. This wise measure is completely in line with the wishes and interests of the Tibetan monks and laypeople and has been warmly supported by all the Tibetan monks and laypeople.

　　The Chinese Communist Party and the central government have always protected patriotic and law-abiding monasteries and implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief. All of us monks should continue to uphold the order of the State Council with practical actions of patriotism and law-abiding, and respond to the care and love of the central government.

　　From now on, all of us Tibetan monks and laypeople must closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, under the direct leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, unite as one, actively assist the People's Liberation Army to quickly and thoroughly quell the rebellion, maintain social order, consolidate the unity of the motherland and national unity, and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

　　Long live the great motherland!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live the great unity of all nationalities in our country!

　　Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in our country!

　　紧密团结在中国共产党周围
　　帕巴拉·卓列朗杰在西藏自治区筹委会全体会议上的报告
    新华社拉萨10日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰8日在筹委会全体委员会议上的书面报告，全文如下：
    代理主任委员、副主任委员、各位委员、各位同志：
    昨天我看了召开全体委员会议的通知之后，心中感到分外高兴。但由于我身体不好，正在病中，不能亲自前来参加这次盛会，深感歉然。关于要在这次会议上讨论通过的五个议案，我完全同意，并衷心地拥护国务院的命令。
    西藏和平解放八年来，中国共产党和中央人民政府非常关怀西藏的进步和发展，曾多方给予大力帮助，因而西藏的政治和经济、文化等建设事业都获得了一定的发展，西藏人民的生活也开始有所改善。人民解放军驻藏部队和进藏工作人员忠实地执行了中国共产党和中央人民政府的民族政策和宗教信仰自由政策，以及关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，因而大大地加强了汉藏民族的团结，提高了西藏人民的爱国主义思想。但是西藏地方政府与上层反动集团，为了维持他们压迫劳动人民的统治地位，以保护宗教和民族利益为借口，勾结帝国主义和国外反动势力进行武装叛乱，妄想把西藏人民重新置于帝国主义及其走狗的黑暗统治之下。过去，中央本着宽大为怀的态度，一再责成西藏地方政府严惩叛乱分子，维护社会治安。但西藏地方政府阳奉阴违，不但不负责平息叛乱，反而纵容支持，助长叛匪气焰。到3月10日，更进一步与叛匪结成一起，劫持达赖喇嘛，撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，悍然背叛祖国，破坏统一，并于3月19日夜间公然向驻拉萨的人民解放军发动全面进攻。他们的这一切做法都是根本违背西藏人民的意志的，因而引起了全藏僧俗人民的极大愤慨和强烈的反对。3月28日国务院命令解散叛国的西藏地方政府、由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权和彻底平息叛乱，这一英明措施是完全符合西藏僧俗人民的愿望和利益的，因而受到了全西藏僧俗人民的热烈拥护。
    中国共产党和中央人民政府一向是保护爱国守法的寺庙和执行宗教信仰自由政策的，我们全体僧众应继续以爱国守法的实际行动来拥护国务院的命令，并以此来回答中央的关怀和爱护。
    今后，我们全藏僧俗人民要紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，在中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹备委员会的直接领导下，团结一致，积极协助人民解放军迅速彻底平息叛乱，维护社会秩序，巩固祖国统一和民族团结，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而努力。
    伟大的祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    我国各民族大团结万岁！
    我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
