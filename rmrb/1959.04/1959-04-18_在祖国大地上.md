　　On the Land of the Motherland
　　Jin Zhonghua
    Since the beginning of this year, the two words people hear most often, wherever they go, are "ten years." A child grows to ten years old, which is when they are most full of vitality. Our motherland is newly born ten years old, and at this time, on the infinitely vast land, vibrant and magnificent scenes are appearing everywhere.
    From the Spring Festival to now, in two months, I have traveled to some places and seen some factories, villages, and cities. Some were visits and tours, others were just brief stopovers. But, there is a general impression: everything is leaping forward and changing rapidly. People's mental outlook is changing, the landscape of the earth is changing, the relationship between people is changing, and the relationship between people and nature is changing. This is truly a season of spring filling the world, and all things growing vigorously!
    In early spring, I took a trip to some islands on the east coast of the motherland to visit the coastal defense troops and fishermen brothers. The short ten days left a lasting and unforgettable impression. These islands were places where bandits and secret agents ran rampant before liberation, and the lives of the fishermen were bleak. They called these places "poor mountains and evil waters." Now, they have completely turned themselves around, and everything has changed. In the past, they only caught fish for two seasons a year, but now they produce in all four seasons; in the past, women did not go to sea, but now it is "thousands of women making waves in the sea"; in the past, no crops were grown on the islands, but now reservoirs have been built in the mountain depressions, and the mountain slopes are lush green; in the past, fishermen sold their children and women, and families were torn apart, but now communes have been established on every island, with public canteens, elementary schools, nurseries, and clinics everywhere, and everyone is beaming with joy. The relationship between people has undergone profound changes. In the past, men cursed women: "Boats fear headwinds, and men fear ghosts in the bed," women were always unlucky. Now, when you see the harmonious atmosphere of a family, men, women, old and young, sitting together in the canteen eating, and see the lively atmosphere of them watching performances together in the square, you will think about how strong they will be when they work!
    In Shanghai, I saw some factories. The industrial base in the suburbs, with a series of factories such as smelting, machinery, and electrical machinery connected together, is like a new city. A newly built workshop in a boiler factory is even larger than the entire factory of the old imperialist "foreign merchants." Thousands of tons of hydraulic presses and tens of thousands of kilowatts of steam turbines are being built. These high-end and large-scale things could not be done without imports in the past. Now, not only are large factories making large machines, but even small factories are doing big things. Some small factories with only a hundred or so people are also performing the miracle of "ants gnawing on bones" and producing big things. This is the result of the socialist great leap forward in the past year, where everyone liberated their minds, broke superstitions, dared to think and dared to do. People's subjective initiative has been fully utilized. The Party's great mass line has opened up an infinitely broad road for our country's industrial construction. We can not only build high-end and large-scale machines, but also build many precision and cutting-edge things. In a watch factory, we saw rows of workers on assembly lines, many of whom were young, quietly and orderly operating delicate tools, carefully crafting and assembling metal flakes and screws that were almost invisible to the eye. The modern environment is very clean, not allowing a speck of dust to stick to the precision parts. We only started this industry two or three years ago, but we have already made highly accurate products. Last year, they produced more than 100,000 pieces; this year, they said proudly that the target they set was 350,000 pieces, and they would strive to exceed 400,000 pieces.
    This year, an inspiring slogan for Shanghai workers striving to complete the leap forward target is "Increase production without increasing manpower." How to do it? Work hard and cleverly, relying on technological innovation. I went to a shipyard. We visited it a year ago, when they were opening up the factory site and filling in the mud pits; this year, when we went again, we saw several ship hulls neatly arranged in the dock, and the workers were working hard with great enthusiasm. Here, what attracted our interest the most was that the comrades in the workers were engaging in technological innovation on a large scale. Some young workers enthusiastically pointed out to us how they and the master craftsmen worked together to create various new things. For example, the copper workshop created an automated lathe that could bend cold steel pipes without heating them red, increasing production efficiency by dozens of times; the woodworking workshop installed four and six knives to operate simultaneously, reducing many processes and greatly improving production efficiency. These are just the beginning of technological innovation. We cannot help but think that the spirit of tenacious struggle and the advanced ideas of daring to break through all difficulties, like those in the drama "People Who Dare to Think and Dare to Do," are playing such a great role in our thousands of factories, mines, fields, workshops, and even laboratories.
    Recently, due to a chance opportunity, I took a trip and passed through the southwest. It was just a fleeting moment, but the majestic and magnificent scenes left in my eyes were infinitely exciting. Ancient cities that have been around for thousands of years are changing their appearance day by day, and are putting on more and more beautiful new clothes. From Kunming to Taiyuan, cities are appearing with wide roads, tall buildings, and majestic factories; railways that pass through mountains and ridges, and powerful high-voltage power lines, are injecting infinite and huge vitality into the southwestern and northwestern plateaus. During the short visit, what impressed me the most was the Nationalities Museum in Kunming. There, we can see how the various ethnic minorities are living such happy and joyful new lives under the leadership of the Communist Party, in our harmonious and united motherland family, since liberation. This is the most powerful answer to the recent rebellion by a small number of reactionary elements in the upper echelons of Tibet and the rumors of imperialism.
    From the coast of the East China Sea to the southwestern plateau, everything is undergoing unprecedented changes in every corner of our motherland. These fragmented but profound impressions over the past two months illustrate one point: the change of people is the root of all changes. Here, people have become the masters of machines, the masters of nature, and the true masters of their own destiny!

　　在祖国大地上
　　金仲华
    今年以来，无论到哪里，人们最多听到的两个字，是“十年。”一个孩子长到十岁，正是最充满着活力的时候。我们祖国的新生十年了，这时候，在无限辽阔的大地上，到处都出现着蓬勃、壮丽的景象。
    从春节到现在，两个月间，我走了一些地方，看了一些工厂、农村和城市。有的是参观访问，有的只是匆匆过路。但是，有一个总的印象：一切在飞跃前进，迅速变化。人的思想面貌在变化，大地的景物形象在变化，人与人的关系在变化，人与自然的关系在变化。这真是一个春满人间，万物茁长怒壮的季节啊。
    春初，我曾在祖国东海岸的一些岛上走了一趟，慰问海防部队和渔民兄弟。短短十天，留下了久久难忘的印象。那些海岛，解放以前是土匪特务横行的地方，渔民的生活暗无天日。他们把这些地方叫做
  “穷山恶水”。现在，彻底翻身了，一切都变了。过去一年只捕两季鱼，现在四季都生产了；过去妇女不出海，现在是“千女闹海”了；过去岛上不种庄稼，现在山窝里筑起水库，山坡上一片青葱了；过去渔民卖儿鬻女，妻离子散，现在个个岛上成立公社，到处有公共食堂、小学校、托儿站、医疗所，人人都喜笑颜开了。人与人的关系起了深刻的变化。过去，男人骂女人：“船怕顶头风，人怕床头鬼”，女人永远是倒霉的。现在，你看一家男女老幼团团地坐在食堂吃饭的和乐气象，看他们一道在广场上看演出的活跃气氛，你会想到，这些人干起活来会有多么粗壮的劲头啊！
    在上海，我看了一些工厂。郊区的工业基地，冶炼、机械、电机等一系列的工厂连在一起，像一座座新的城市。一个锅炉厂新建的车间，比旧时帝国主义“洋商”的整个厂还要大。几千吨的水压机，几万瓩的汽轮机，都在造起来了。这些高级、大型的东西，过去不靠进口是没有办法的。现在，不仅大厂在造大机器，甚至小厂也要办大事，有些百把个人的小厂，也在表演着“蚂蚁啃骨头”的奇迹，搞出大东西来。这就是一年来社会主义大跃进，人人解放思想、破除迷信、敢想敢做的结果。人的主观能动性充分发挥出来了。党的伟大的群众路线，给我们祖国的工业建设打开了一条无限宽阔的道路。我们不仅能造高级、大型的机器，而且也要造许多精密、尖端的东西。在一个手表制造厂，我们看到一排排流水作业的工人，许多是年青的，在静静地有秩序地操作着精巧的工具，琢磨着和拼装着眼睛几乎看不见的金属薄片和螺丝钉。非常整洁的现代化环境，不让一点尘土沾上精密的机件。我们创始这种工业还不过二、三年的历史，但是已经做出高度准确的产品了。去年产了十多万只；今年，他们豪迈地说，订的指标是三十五万只，还要争取超过四十万只。
    今年，上海工人争取完成跃进指标中的一句动人口号，是“增产不增人”。怎样做到呢？苦干加巧干，靠技术革新。我到了一个造船厂。一年前，我们去过，那时正在开拓厂地，填平泥坑；今年再去，见到的是几条船身整齐地排列在船坞，工人们正叮叮当当地鼓足干劲工作着。在这里，最吸引我们兴趣的就是工人同志们大搞技术革新。一些青年工人兴致勃勃地指给我们看，他们和老师傅在一起，怎样搞起各种各样的新东西来。例如，铜工车间创制一台自动化的车床，把冷钢管不用烧红就能加以弯曲，生产效率提高了几十倍；木工车间装了四把刀、六把刀同时操作，减少了许多工序，把生产效率大大提高。这些还不过是技术革新初露苗头。我们不能不想到，像话剧“敢想敢做的人们”中的那种顽强苦斗的精神，那种敢于突破一切困难的先进思想，正在我们成千上万的工厂、矿山、田野、车间、以至试验室里，起着多么伟大的作用。
    最近，由于偶然的机会，我作了一次旅行，路过西南。只是匆匆而过，但是留在我眼底的雄伟壮阔的景象，却是令人无限兴奋的。千百年来的古老城市，正在日新月异地改变面貌，换上愈来愈美丽的新装。从昆明到太原，一个个城市，都在出现宽阔的马路，高大的建筑，雄伟的工厂；穿山过岭的铁路，刚劲有力的高压电线，正在给西南、西北高原地带灌注着无限巨大的生命力。在短短的参观中，给我印象最深的，是昆明的一个民族博物馆。在那里，我们可以看到解放以来，在共产党的领导下，在我们和睦团结的祖国大家庭中，各少数民族是过着多么愉快幸福的新生活。这对于最近西藏一小撮上层反动分子的叛乱和帝国主义的造谣，正是最有力的回答。
    从东海之滨到西南高原，在我们祖国大地上的每一个角落，一切都在起着空前的变化。两个月来这些片断的然而深刻的印象，说明了一点：人的变化是一切变化的根本。在我们这里，人已经做了机器的主人，做了自然的主人，做了自己命运的真正主人了！
