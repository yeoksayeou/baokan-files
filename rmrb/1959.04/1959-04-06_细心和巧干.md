Title: Diligence and Ingenuity

Zhang Shou Gong was able to accumulate over 700 workdays last year, and it seems the key lies in two words: "Ingenuity" and "Diligence." He pays attention to trivial matters that most people overlook; with slight calculation and reform, he solves big problems.

Here are two examples. Last spring, more than thirty commune members transported fertilizer from the back hills to the fields, separated by a small stream, requiring a detour of one hundred and forty *zhang* (approximately 467 meters). One day, Zhang Shou Gong joined the fertilizer transport and quickly realized that this detour wasted time. He conveniently cut down a few trees and built a simple bridge, eliminating the detour and increasing work efficiency by 21%. On another occasion, the commune used a boat to transport more than 160 *dan* (approximately 8,000 kilograms) of lime for fertilizer, which stopped at a small river five *li* (2.5 kilometers) away from the commune. In previous years, they always transported the lime to the commune and then to the riverbank when needed for application in the fields. Moving the lime twice cost a lot of labor. Last year, Zhang Shou Gong suggested storing the lime in commune members' homes near the river for convenient access. This saved more than twenty workdays of transporting lime.

These things seem to be extremely ordinary and trivial, things that exist in large quantities in the countryside, and things that everyone can easily do. However, some cadres and commune members do not pay much attention to these small matters. In their view, either focus on major tool reforms, or these sesame-sized small things are not worth much effort. This view is obviously one-sided. Admittedly, vigorously carrying out tool reforms is the main way to solve the current labor shortage. However, one should never ignore finding ways to save time from all the small places. The more ordinary the small things, the more universal they are. As long as everyone pays attention, the potential for increasing work efficiency is great.

Take the example of building a simple bridge: without the bridge, a person carrying fertilizer would have to walk an extra one hundred and forty *zhang*. One hundred and fifty *zhang* is one *li*. One person would have to walk nearly one *li* extra each time they carried fertilizer, and thirty people would walk more than thirty *li* extra in one trip. If hundreds of millions of farmers across the country paid attention to this type of "small thing," how much time could be saved! Small things add up to big things and can solve big problems.

"Having a plan when doing things" is a fine tradition of our country's farmers. Zhang Shou Gong has precisely inherited this fine tradition, promoted the spirit of being masters of one's own house, being diligent every day, everywhere, and in everything, calculating carefully in everything, no matter how big or small, and creating miracles in ordinary labor.

    细心和巧干
    胡坚
    张守功去年为什么能够做七百多个劳动日？看来关键在两个字上：一曰“巧”，二曰“细”。在一般人不大注意的细小事情上，他随时随地都很注意；稍稍盘算一下、改革一下，就解决了大问题。
    这里只举两个例子。去年春天，三十多名社员从后山运肥下田，中间隔着一条小港，要绕道一百四十丈。有一天张守功参加运肥，很快就发觉这样绕道浪费时间。他顺便砍了几株树，搭了一条便桥，运肥的人不再走弯路，就提高工效21％。还有一次社里用船运一百六十多担做肥料用的石灰，停在离社里五里路的小河边。往年，他们总是把石灰运到社里，到需用的时候再运到河边，施到田里。石灰搬两次家，花费许多工。去年张守功建议把石灰寄存在河边社员家里，就近取用。这样就节约了二十多个运石灰的劳动日。
    这些事情，看起来都是极其平凡的、细小的事情，是农村中大量存在的事情，也是每个人轻而易举地可以办得到的事情。但是，有些干部和社员还不太关心这些小事情。在他们看来，要么就大搞工具改革，在这些芝麻样的小事情上，没有多大油水。这种看法显然是片面的。诚然，大搞工具改革是解决当前劳力不足的主要途径。但是，任何时候也不能忽视从一切小地方想办法节约时间。越是平凡的小事情，越带有普遍性。只要大家注意，提高工效的潜力是很大的。
    就拿搭便桥的例子来说吧：没有便桥，一个人挑一次肥料多走一百四十丈。一百五十丈就是一里路。一个人运一次肥料要白白地多走将近一里路，三十个人一次就要多走三十多里路。如果全国几亿农民都注意这一类“小事情”，能节约多少时间啊！小事情聚起来就成了大事情，就能解决大问题。
      “做事有盘算”，本是我国农民的优良传统。张守功正是继承了这种优良传统，发扬了当家作主的精神，日日勤、处处勤、事事勤，事无大小精打细算，就在平凡的劳动中创造了奇迹。
