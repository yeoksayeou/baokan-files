    The Year of the Great Leap Forward in Culture and Education
    Speech by Committee Member Chen Wangdao

    Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. I would like to discuss some of my personal experiences regarding the cultural and educational aspects of Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, based on my work unit and my observations of the cultural and educational situation in Shanghai.

    Last year was a year of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in our country, and also a year of the Great Leap Forward in culture and education. The leap forward in culture and education is primarily reflected in quantity, especially in the quantity of spare-time education. Last year, Shanghai launched a mass movement to establish spare-time schools. In September and October alone, Shanghai established more than 6,200 spare-time schools, which were later merged into more than 5,200. Factories established schools, hospitals established schools. All those who had the conditions to establish schools did so. Such a large-scale school establishment movement was unprecedented.

    In addition to the rapid leap forward in quantity, there have also been significant changes in the spiritual essence of culture, education, and health, mainly reflected in the following aspects:

    (1) Great achievements have been made in implementing the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. Last year, in addition to factories and rural areas, a surge of participation in productive labor also swept through full-time institutions of higher learning. The original work-study programs in schools, which universally became linked with factories and agricultural cooperatives, developed into schools running their own factories and farms. Students and teachers gradually eliminated the idea of ​​belittling labor and laborers, and gradually developed the habit of participating in productive labor. This is a fundamental negation of the erroneous idea of ​​"those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others" that has existed for thousands of years, and also a fundamental elimination of the source of ridicule by the working people of "lack of physical labor and ignorance of the five grains" that has existed for thousands of years. As Premier Zhou said in his report, this is "a huge and profound revolution in education." Not only does productive labor itself have its noble value, but it also has a profound influence on education and academics. Education completely divorced from productive labor can no longer stand, and the style of neglecting the present and seeking far away, valuing the ancient over the modern, and emphasizing the foreign over the Chinese can no longer stand. This lays a solid foundation for conducting academic discussions and academic criticism based on Marxism-Leninism. Several universities we inspected already have a new atmosphere in this regard. We saw teachers and students working happily in factories and fields, and they also had some new creations.

    (2) The Party's prestige in cultural and educational undertakings has been fully established. Before the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, the clamoring of those who said that outsiders could not lead insiders, and that the Party should lead politics while experts should lead academics, has disappeared. During our inspection, we had discussions with many elderly and young teachers and students. They all thanked the Party for helping them achieve success in various aspects:

    (A) Providing them with correct guidelines and policies at any time, giving their work a guiding principle. For example, Shanghai's Guangci Hospital has now become a famous hospital for rescuing critically ill patients. It became famous for rescuing worker Qiu Cai Kang from burns. Qiu Cai Kang's burn area reached 89.3%, which was generally considered hopeless, but the Party decided to save him. The hospital carried out rescue, finally saving him, and now he is in good health. This is an example. Once this example was set, the communist spirit of rescuing critically ill patients became a trend in various hospitals.

    (B) Vigorously organizing collaboration for them. For example, rescuing Qiu Cai Kang once involved multifaceted collaboration, achieving unprecedented results. The work of revising the "History of Chinese Literature" written by students of Fudan University, which is currently being discussed in the Shanghai Jiefang Daily, has also been organized through multifaceted collaboration, which has played a greater role than usual. Because division of labor and collaboration can better lead to the concentrated exertion of everyone's wisdom and strength.

    (C) Because the direction is clear and the strength is concentrated, it is easier to give full play to everyone's enthusiasm and creativity. Therefore, it is often possible to create miracles and do things that cannot be done without leadership or concentration.

    (3) The mass line was implemented in teaching and academic discussions, giving full play to the strength and role of the masses, and great achievements were made. In teaching and scientific discussions, various universities, in addition to using the methods of great contending, great blooming, and big-character posters, also adopted the method of teachers and students combined under the leadership of the Party committee to carry out a large amount of work in compiling teaching materials and academic discussions. Due to putting politics in command, combining theory with practice, and giving full play to collective wisdom, the general quality, especially the ideological quality, is relatively high.

    These are all relatively prominent manifestations of last year. In the various tasks of last year, the democratic parties and members of the democratic parties have done some work and made certain contributions under the leadership of the Party.

    The most problematic thing in cultural, educational, and health work now is that the quality cannot meet the needs of the ever-changing development. We must try every means to improve quality. On the issue of improving quality, I once put forward two "unreserved" suggestions to encourage members of democratic parties:

    First, unreservedly transform oneself and improve oneself;

    Second, unreservedly impart knowledge and cultivate young people.

    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's words: "It is wrong to think that the old intellectuals no longer need to carry out self-transformation, or that they must complete a thorough transformation in a very short period of time, otherwise they cannot do work. All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-transformation in the long-term practice of work." "We...must help them study Marxism-Leninism, help them have more opportunities to approach the masses, understand the actual situation, and, based on voluntary participation, appropriately participate in physical labor." Premier Zhou also said: "Young intellectuals also have the task of constantly carrying out self-transformation. No matter what position they are in, they should strive to improve their professional level, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, participate in the practice of mass production and struggle, participate in physical labor, and strictly demand themselves politically and ideologically and in their work. Young intellectuals should humbly learn from the knowledgeable elders, and older intellectuals should also learn from the strengths of young intellectuals. All patriotic intellectuals should unite under the banner of socialism and work together to build a great motherland."

    I hope everyone will take Premier Zhou's words as our motto.

    As for the imperialists and foreign reactionaries using the armed rebellion of a few rebellious elements in Tibet to kidnap the Dalai Lama and flee to India, stirring up trouble in an attempt to interfere in our country's internal affairs, I, like everyone else, feel infinite indignation. Our country will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, nor will it allow other countries to interfere in our country's internal affairs. If anyone attempts to interfere in our country's internal affairs, no matter what name they use, no matter what face they put on, they will be resolutely opposed by the people of our country, and they will suffer a shameful defeat.

### 文化教育大跃进的一年  陈望道委员的发言

    文化教育大跃进的一年
    陈望道委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告。我想就周总理政府工作报告中关于文化教育的部分，结合我的工作单位和我在上海视察所及的文化教育的情况略述一些个人的体会。
    去年是我国工农业大跃进的一年，也是文化教育大跃进的一年。文化教育的跃进，首先表现在数量上，特别是表现在业余教育的数量上。去年在上海曾经掀起一个大办业余学校的群众运动，单是去年九、十两个月，上海就办了六千二百余所业余学校，后来合并成为五千二百余所。工厂办学校，医院办学校。凡是有条件办学校的也都办学校。这样声势浩大的办学运动是前所未有的。
    除了数量上有飞速跃进的发展外，在文化教育卫生的精神实质上，也有了显著的变化，主要表现在下列几个方面：
    （一）在贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的工作方针下取得的巨大的成就。去年除了工厂、农村外，在全日制的高等学校里，也曾经普遍掀起参加生产劳动的热潮，从原有的学校开展勤工俭学运动，普遍同工厂、农业社挂钩，发展成为学校自办工厂、农场。学生、教师逐渐消除了轻视劳动和轻视劳动者的思想，逐渐养成了参加生产劳动的习惯。这是对几千年来“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的错误思想的根本的否定，也是几千年来“四体不勤，五谷不分”被劳动人民讥笑的来源的根本的消除。这正如周总理报告中所说：是“教育事业的巨大的深刻的革命”，不但生产劳动本身有其崇高的价值，而且在教育上、学术上也有其深刻的影响。完全脱离生产劳动的教育从此站不住，厚古薄今，重外轻中等忽近图远的脱离实际的作风，从此更其站不住。这就为根据马克思列宁主义进行学术讨论、学术批判打下坚实的基础。我们视察过的几个高等学校在这方面都已经有一种新风气，我们看见师生都在工厂在田间愉快的工作，而且还有一些新的创造。
    （二）党在文教事业中的威信已经完全确立起来。整风反右以前，曾经有人叫嚷的什么外行不能领导内行，以及党领导政治，专家领导学术等等说法已经绝迹了。我们视察时曾经同许多老年、青年教师和学生进行座谈，他们都感谢党在种种方面使他们有成就：
    （甲）为他们随时定出正确的方针政策，使他们的工作有了准绳。例如上海的广慈医院，现在已经成为抢救危急病人的一个著名医院，它从抢救工人丘财康烫伤出名。丘财康烫伤面积达百分之八十九点三，一般以为无救，而党决定要救，医院就进行抢救，终于救活，而且现在健康很好。便是一个例子。这个例子一开，抢救危急病人的共产主义精神便在各个医院形成为一种风气。
    （乙）为他们大力组织协作。例如抢救丘财康曾经组织多方面通力协作，取得了前所未有的成绩。现在上海解放日报上正在讨论的修改复旦大学学生写的“中国文学史”的工作，也曾经组织多方面通力协作，也发挥了比之寻常更大的作用。因为分工协作更能有领导地集中地发挥各人的智慧和力量。
    （丙）因为方针明确，力量集中，更能发挥大家的积极性和创造性。所以往往能够特创奇迹，做出无领导不集中时所不能做出的事情。
    （三）在教学工作和学术讨论中贯彻了群众路线，发挥了群众的力量和作用，取得了很大的成绩。各高等学校，在教学工作和科学讨论，除了运用大鸣大放大字报的方法外，并采取在党委领导下的教师、学生三结合的方法，进行了大量的编写教材、学术讨论的工作。由于政治挂帅，结合实际，发挥集体智慧，一般质量特别是思想性比较高。
    像这种种都是去年较为特出的表现。在去年的各种工作中，民主党派和民主党派的成员都曾在党的领导下做了一定的工作，有了一定的贡献。
    现在文教卫生工作中最成问题的是质量不能适应日新月异的发展的需要，必须千方百计，设法提高质量。在提高质量的问题上，我曾经提出两个“无保留”与民主党派的成员互相劝勉：
    一是无保留地改造自己，提高自己；
    一是无保留地传授知识，培养青年。
    我完全同意周总理说的话：“以为旧知识分子已经不需要再进行自我改造，或者以为他们必须在很短的时间内完成彻底的改造，否则就不能做工作，都是不对的。一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造。”“我们……要帮助他们进行马克思列宁主义的学习，帮助他们有更多的机会接近群众，了解实际情况，并且根据自愿，适当地参加体力劳动。”周总理又说：“年青的知识分子也有经常进行自我改造的任务，他们不论在什么工作岗位上，都应当在努力提高自己的业务水平的同时，认真地学习马克思列宁主义，参加群众的生产和斗争的实践，参加体力劳动，在政治思想上和在工作中严格地要求自己。年青的知识分子要虚心地向有学问的前辈学习，年长的知识分子也要学习青年知识分子的长处。一切爱国的知识分子都应当在社会主义的旗帜下面团结起来，共同为建设伟大的祖国而努力。”
    我希望大家都以周总理的这句话作为我们的座右铭。
    至于对于帝国主义和外国反动派假借西藏少数叛乱分子武装叛乱劫持达赖喇嘛逃亡到印度，兴风作浪企图干涉我国内政，我也同大家一样，感到无限的愤慨。我国决不干涉别国内政，也决不容许别国干涉我国的内政。如果企图干涉我国内政，无论他假借任何名义，他装作任何嘴脸，都要遭到我国人民坚决的反对，都将遭到可耻的失败。
