Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: Shanghai's machinery industry is accelerating the production of rolling mills by concentrating its efforts on destroying the enemy one set at a time. In the first quarter, fifteen sets of small and medium-sized rolling mills with an annual steel production capacity of 1.475 million tons were completed. The majority of the rolling mill manufacturing tasks for the whole year can be completed in the first half of the year.

This year, Shanghai has a large task of manufacturing rolling mills, and the time is tight. If we proceed simultaneously, we will inevitably disperse our strength. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Machinery has organized several collaborative networks for complete set production according to various types of rolling mills. Within each collaborative network, one or two large and medium-sized factories are the main force, surrounded by dozens of factories, completing one set before starting another. For each set of rolling mills, from the main engine and auxiliary engine to key components, the Machinery Bureau has drawn up a schedule, designated specific personnel to be responsible, and regularly checks the progress by set, ensuring that the manufacturing of each part of a set of rolling mills can be interconnected. This makes it easier to concentrate manufacturing power and materials and shorten the manufacturing cycle. For example, the three sets of sheet mills that began manufacturing at the beginning of the year were originally produced separately by three small collaborative networks. Due to the dispersion of raw materials and machining power, all three sets would not be completed until April. In early March, it was changed to a large collaboration, producing one set at a time. The first set of sheet mills was basically completed by the end of March, and the other two sets can also be completed in April. This also makes scheduling more flexible and problems can be solved quickly. For example, in mid-March, the Machinery Bureau found that the main engine was being manufactured faster, but some auxiliary machines were not keeping up, so it quickly organized the power of more than a dozen factories to help rush the production of auxiliary machines, thereby ensuring the need for rolling mill matching.

In each factory, various methods are also adopted to ensure that the rolling mills are completed on schedule and in complete sets. Hudong Shipyard had to manufacture a set of section steel rolling mill with an annual output of 250,000 tons, but the machine tool processing could not keep up, so the workers first used air cutting tools and other means to replace the machine tools for the rough processing of the frame; the cadres of the locomotive workshop also went to each machine tool group to participate in labor, grasping the progress of each part and the connection between the upper and lower processes. Whichever link was weak, they would attack it, so that no part of the rolling mill was missing.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: All the equipment for the No. 2 simple coke oven, which was arranged to be produced in early February, has been manufactured and delivered ahead of schedule. The production task of a large number of No. 3 simple coke oven equipment has also been arranged recently. The equipment for simple coal washing plants is also being rushed. Eighty simple coal washing machines, which were arranged to be produced in early February, have been manufactured ahead of schedule by Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, and another 170 belt conveyors have been manufactured by Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory and Shenyang Belt Conveyor Factory.

Various places are stepping up the construction of simple coal washing plants and simple coking ovens so that these equipments can be quickly installed and put into production. As of late March, more than 1,100 No. 2 simple coke ovens and more than 100 simple coal washing plants have been under construction throughout the country. In terms of simple coke ovens, the start-up rate in Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Henan, Gansu and other places is relatively high, and the number of start-ups has reached 50% to 94% of the planned figures. Hebei, Anhui, Shandong and other places are working hard to speed up the progress of the project. Areas with fewer start-ups such as Sichuan and Shanxi are also catching up. In terms of simple coal washing plants, 19 of the 24 planned to be built in Hebei Province have started construction. The number of start-ups in Anhui, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Ningxia, Gansu, Liaoning and Sichuan has also accounted for more than 50% of the planned number.

In order to quickly meet the needs of the steel industry, the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission and the State Construction Commission all believe that the construction of simple coke ovens and simple coal washing plants should be accelerated on the premise of fully ensuring the quality of construction. Judging from the current manufacturing and construction situation, simple coal washing plants should be caught up with greater efforts so that after the coke ovens are completed, qualified washed coal can be used for coking to ensure the quality of coke.

    组织协作网　赶制轧钢机
    上海加强组织领导专人负责按套检查进度加快
    各地提前完成二号简易焦炉设备生产任务
    新华社上海6日电　上海市机械工业在赶制轧钢机中，采取集中力量一套一套地打歼灭战的办法，进度加快。第一季度完成十五套年产能力共为一百四十七点五万吨钢材的中小型轧钢机，全年轧钢机制造任务，大部分都能在上半年完成。
    今年上海制造的轧钢机任务大，时间急。如果齐头并进，势必分散力量。上海市机械局按照各种不同类型的轧钢机，组织了好多个成套生产的协作网。每一个协作网内，又以一两个大中型的工厂为主，周围环绕几十家工厂，做完一套再做一套。对每一套轧钢机，从主机、辅机一直到关键性的零部件，机械局都排出进度表，指定专人负责，并且经常按套进行检查，保证一套轧钢机的各个部分的制造都能互相衔接。这样做，就便于更集中地使用制造力量和材料，缩短制造周期。比如年初开始制造的三套薄板机，原来是分成三个小协作网分头进行生产的，由于原材料和机械加工力量分散，三套都要到4月份才能完成。3月上旬改为大协作，一套一套地生产以后，第一套薄板机在3月底就基本上完成，另外两套4月份也能完成。这样做，调度也更灵活，问题解决起来快。例如3月中旬机械局发现主机制造较快，有些辅机没有跟上，就很快组织十多家工厂的力量帮助赶制辅机，从而保证了轧钢机配套的需要。
    在每家工厂里，也采取各种办法保证轧钢机按期按套地完成。沪东造船厂要制造一套年产二十五万吨的型钢轧机，但是机床加工来不及，工人们就先用风割工具等代替机床进行机架的粗加工；造机车间的干部还分头到每个机床小组参加劳动，抓每个零件的进度和上下道工序的衔接，那一环薄弱就攻那一环，结果使轧钢机上的零件一个不少地生产出来。
    据新华社6日讯　2月初布置生产的二号简易焦炉全部设备，已经提前制成交货。大批三号简易焦炉设备的生产任务，又在最近作了安排。简易洗煤厂的设备，目前也在加紧赶制中。2月初布置生产的简易洗煤机，已有八十台在沈阳矿山机器厂提前制成，还有一百七十台皮带运输机已经在张家口矿山机器厂和沈阳皮带机厂制成。
    各地正在加紧建设简易洗煤厂和简易炼焦炉，以便使这些设备迅速安装起来投入生产。截至3月下旬，全国各地已有一千一百多座二号简易焦炉和一百多个简易洗煤厂在施工。在简易焦炉方面，内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、上海、江苏、浙江、湖北、河南、甘肃等地开工率较高，开工的座数已达计划数字的50％到94％。河北、安徽、山东等地正在努力加快工程进度。四川、山西等地开工较少的地区也在迎头赶上。在简易洗煤厂方面，河北省计划建设的二十四座已有十九座开工。安徽、内蒙古、黑龙江、宁夏、甘肃、辽宁和四川开工数也已占计划数50％以上。
    为了迅速满足钢铁工业的需要，国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会和国家建设委员会都认为，简易焦炉和简易洗煤厂还应当在充分保证施工质量的前提下，加快建设进度。从目前实际制造和建设的情况看，简易洗煤厂应该用更大的气力赶上来，使焦炉建成后，能够有合格的洗煤来炼焦，以保证焦炭的质量。
