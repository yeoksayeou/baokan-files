    At the Post of People's Police
    By our reporter Zhu Zemin

    Must reunite mother and daughter
    Liu Jingsheng, a police officer from the Xiaoguan Street Police Station in Tianjin, led a woman in her twenties across streets and into a home. As soon as they entered, Liu Jingsheng pointed to an elderly woman with white hair and said to the young woman, "This is your mother, from whom you have been separated for thirteen years." Before Liu Jingsheng could finish speaking, the mother and daughter were already embracing and crying with excitement.

    What was the story behind this? It turned out that last winter, the Xiaoguan Street Police Station received a letter from Wang Xuemin, a nurse at Qingdao Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, requesting the People's Police to help her find her mother from whom she had been separated for thirteen years. The letter only stated: "My mother's surname is Song, from Xiaodian. It is said that after my father died, she married an electrical worker named Wang Wu, who lives in the Xiaoguan Street area..." After reading the letter, police officer Liu Jingsheng searched through all the household registration books within his jurisdiction, but could not find anyone named Wang Wu. He then used his spare time to visit old residents, and based on the clue that Wang Wu was an electrical worker, he visited all the electrical workers in his jurisdiction, but still found nothing. One Saturday evening, everyone was happily enjoying their weekend, but Liu Jingsheng had no intention of having fun. The matter of Wang Xuemin searching for her mother was always on his mind. "I must reunite this mother and daughter who have been separated for thirteen years!" he thought, and took out the letter to examine it carefully. When he saw "My mother's surname is Song, from Xiaodian," a thought suddenly struck him. "Xiaodian? There is a Xiaodian in the suburbs of Tianjin, maybe the letter mistakenly wrote 'Dian' as 'Dian'." He decided to go to Xiaodian. The next day was Sunday, and he set off early in the morning braving the biting cold wind. Upon arriving in Xiaodian and asking around, there were over a hundred households with the surname Song, which presented another challenge. But he immediately made up his mind: "Even if there are over a hundred households, I will get to the bottom of this!" The Party Branch Secretary of Xiaodian also helped him visit old residents, asking everyone to provide clues. Coincidentally, a farmer knew about it, saying: "Grandma Song has a daughter who married someone named Wang Wu, who doesn't live in Xiaoguan Street, but in the Jinzhonghe area." Upon hearing this, Liu Jingsheng said happily: "I've found them!" Without even bothering to eat, he immediately rushed back to Tianjin, and finally found Wang Xuemin's mother, reuniting the mother and daughter who had been separated for thirteen years!

      Fighting the Fire
    The screech of a fire engine broke the silence of midnight. Upon receiving a fire alarm from the Hongqi Oil Factory, the firefighters of Tianjin Fire Brigade 7 immediately geared up and set off.

    The fire was spreading fiercely. The oil pressing and refining workshops were ablaze, and huge flames were directly threatening the oil factory's core, the oil storage depot. Workers were anxiously shouting, "Comrades, you must protect the oil storage depot!" To protect every plant and tree of socialism is the firefighter's duty. At that moment, Communist Party member Liu Yuntang rushed into the workshop. The fire was burning fiercely, and the thick smoke was suffocating. Bricks and tiles were collapsing everywhere from the roof, and flames were shooting up three or four zhang high. In such a dangerous situation, Liu Yuntang showed no fear, wielding a water gun and battling the flames. In order to subdue the fire from a commanding position, he gritted his teeth and climbed up the iron ladder, which had already been scorched hot, and finally extinguished the flames.

    In order to protect every plant and tree of socialism, and to protect the safety of the people's lives, Liu Yuntang demonstrated the heroic character of a Communist Party member at every fire scene.

    Rescuing Children from Danger
    Gao Lianfen, a female traffic police officer in Tianjin, was directing the endless flow of traffic. Suddenly, a four or five-year-old boy ran across the road from the sidewalk. When he reached the middle of the road, a tram was coming, and the situation was extremely dangerous. It was too late for the tram to brake. Gao Lianfen immediately rushed forward bravely, pushing the child to the side of the road, and covering the child with her own body. At that moment, the tram passed by. Although Gao Lianfen herself was injured by the tram, she felt indescribably happy knowing that she had prevented a serious accident.

    Incidents like this have happened more than once to this Communist Party member. One day, a tricycle full of goods overturned. She rushed over and saw that the tricycle worker trapped underneath was seriously injured, and his cotton coat was already soaked with blood. It was quite difficult for Gao Lianfen, who was of small stature, to carry the worker on her back, but she did not hesitate. She used all her strength to lift the tricycle worker and carry him towards the hospital. On another occasion, Gao Lianfen saw an old woman faint. She immediately escorted her to the hospital. Later, from a piece of paper in the old woman's pocket, she found the address of her granddaughter, Wang Xiuli. Gao Lianfen immediately called to notify her. When Wang Xiuli arrived at the hospital, she tightly grasped Gao Lianfen's hand, speechless for a long time, her eyes filled with tears.

    In a letter of commendation to Gao Lianfen, tricycle worker Qi Baogui wrote: "You are a person full of communist spirit."

    在人民警察的岗位上
    本报记者　朱泽民
    一定要让母女团聚
    天津市小关街派出所民警刘经升领着一个二十多岁的妇女穿过一条条的马路，走进一家人家。一进屋，刘经升就指着一位白发苍苍的老大娘对年青的妇女说：“这就是和你分离了十三年的母亲。”刘经升的话还没有说完，母女俩已经激动得搂着哭做一团。
    这是怎么回事呢？原来在去年冬天，小关街派出所收到了青岛中医医院护士王学敏的来信，要求人民警察帮助她寻找分离了十三年的母亲。信中只是说：“我母亲姓宋，小店人，据说父亲死后又嫁给一个叫王五的电料工人，住小关街一带……。”民警刘经升看了看信，翻遍了管界内的户口册，也没有王五这个人。他就每天利用休息时间去访问老住户，又根据王五是电料工人的线索，访问了管界内所有的电料工人，也没有着落。一个星期六的晚上，人们都愉快地度周末去了，可是刘经升根本没有心思玩，王学敏寻找母亲的事情总在脑子里萦绕着。“我一定要让分离了十三年的母女团聚！”他想着想着，又拿出信来仔细琢磨。当他看到“我母亲姓宋，小店人”的时候，突然心里一动。“小店？天津郊区有个小淀，也许是信里把淀写成店了。”他决定到小淀去一趟。第二天是星期日，一早就冒着刺骨寒风出发了。到了小淀一问，姓宋的有一百多户，这一下难题又来了。但是他立刻下了决心：“就是一百多户也要找个水落石出！”小淀的党支部书记也帮助他访问老住户，让大家提供线索。可巧一个农民知道了，他说：“宋奶奶有个女儿嫁给一个叫王五的，不是住在小关街，是住在金钟河一带。”刘经升一听，高兴地说：“可找到了！”他也顾不得吃饭，立刻赶回天津，终于找到了王学敏的母亲，使分离了十三年的母女重新团聚！
      同大火搏斗
    一声消防车的尖叫，划破了午夜的寂静。天津市消防七队的战士们，在接到红旗油厂的火警以后，立刻就整装出动了。
    火势在凶猛地蔓延着。榨油、清油等车间都烧着了，巨大的火舌直向油厂的心脏储油库扑过去。工人们急得直喊：“同志们，你们一定得把储油库保住啊！”保卫社会主义的一草一木，这是消防队员的天职。这时，共产党员刘云棠一头就闯进了车间。大火在燃烧着，滚滚的油烟呛得人透不过气来，屋顶的砖瓦四处乱崩，火苗窜出有三、四丈高，在这样危险的情况下，刘云棠毫无惧色，端着水枪和火舌搏斗。他为了居高临下制服大火，咬紧牙关爬上了已经被烧得热热的铁梯，终于扑灭了火焰。
    为了保卫社会主义的一草一木，保卫人民的生命安全，刘云棠在每一个火场都表现了一个共产党员的英雄本色。
    抢救孩子出险
    天津市女交通民警高连芬正在指挥着来往不绝的车辆。突然，一个四、五岁的小男孩从边道上穿过马路跑来，跑到马路中央，正好一辆电车开过来，情况非常危险，电车刹车已经来不及了。高连芬立刻奋不顾身地疾步跑上前去，把小孩推向路边，又把自己的身体伏在孩子身上，这时，电车一下开过去了，虽然高连芬自己被电车碰伤了，可是她想到避免了这次严重事故的时候，心里却有说不出来的高兴。
    像这样的事情，发生在这位共产党员的身上，已不止一次了。有一天，一辆满载货物的三轮车翻倒了，她急忙跑过去一看，被砸在底下的三轮工人伤势很重，鲜血已经浸透棉袄。身材矮小的高连芬要背起这个工人来，确实是相当吃力的，可是她没有犹疑，用尽力气一下子就把三轮工人背起来，走向医院。还有一次高连芬看到一位老太太晕倒了，立刻就把她护送到医院，后来从老太太的口袋里的一张纸条上才发现了她孙女王秀丽的地址，高连芬马上用电话通知她。当王秀丽赶到医院以后，紧紧地握住高连芬的手，半天没说出话来，只是激动得两眼涌出了热泪。
    三轮工人祁宝贵在给高连芬写的一封表扬信中说：“你是一个充满共产主义风格的人。”（附图片）
