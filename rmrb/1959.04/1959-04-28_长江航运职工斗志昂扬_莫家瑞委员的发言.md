Yangtze River Shipping Workers Show High Morale
Speech by Committee Member Mo Jiarui

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the reports by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

These reports profoundly analyze and comprehensively summarize the great achievements of our socialist construction over the past four years, especially in 1958. From our actual struggles and real life, we deeply understand the correctness of these reports.

In 1958, the Yangtze River Shipping workers completed the Third Book of Accounts ahead of schedule, with cargo volume increasing by 31 percent and cargo turnover increasing by 21 percent compared to 1957. However, this does not fully illustrate the leap forward situation. In the latter half of last year, especially after August, the water transport situation suddenly presented a fierce, heavy-duty, and time-sensitive situation.

Under the leadership of the Party, all employees issued a resounding slogan: "Take steel as the key link," act as the "vanguard," transport whatever Marshal Steel needs, and transport it wherever it needs to go, with soaring enthusiasm and high morale. As a result, the cargo volume from September to December increased by 56 percent and the cargo turnover increased by 30 percent compared to the same period in 1957.

Completing such arduous tasks was not without difficulties. The increase in transport capacity could not keep up with the increase in transport volume. The heavier the task, the more prominent this contradiction became. However, difficulties did not scare us, nor did they stop us from advancing victoriously.

Using Advanced Soviet Experience to Fully Exploit Ship Horsepower

The Party's general line for socialist construction illuminates our path forward. If transport capacity is insufficient, we will engage in a vigorous technical revolution and do everything possible to tap the potential of ships. On the port side, we will vigorously improve loading and unloading efficiency and shorten ship berthing time to accelerate ship turnover. In terms of motorized vessels, we will liberate horsepower and tonnage, thereby increasing horsepower by approximately 40,000 horsepower, about 40 percent of the original horsepower, and increasing deadweight by 88,000 tons. If these horsepower and tonnage were calculated based on newly built ships, it would require an investment of approximately 50 million yuan.

We also fully exploited the horsepower of ships and used the advanced Soviet experience of push-towing. The "Youth" tug once pushed thirteen iron barges downstream. The successful remote automatic control experiment, combining driving and engine operation, has begun a major change on ships, and push-towing will have a greater development, and the potential of ships will be further tapped.

Everyone knows that the Sichuan River has many scenic spots and historical sites, but in the past, those engaged in shipping were headache at the mere mention of this section of the Yangtze River, because the road is tortuous, there are many hidden reefs, the water flow is turbulent and rapid, and there are whirlpools, backflows and eddies in the river, and the water conditions are very bad. There are dozens of large and small dangerous shoals, and navigation conditions are very bad in some places, such as Qingtan and Xietan. Sometimes the water level above and below the shoals differs greatly. The Kongling section is particularly dangerous, with narrow and winding waterways and bad water conditions. Therefore, in the past, some people said, "Qingtan and Xietan don't count as shoals, Kongling is the gate of hell."

However, the dangers of the shoals cannot deter the shipping personnel of the Mao Zedong era. Since liberation, I have been driving ships on the Sichuan River and have safely navigated 400,000 kilometers. Day and night navigation and push-towing have become a common phenomenon in the Great Leap Forward last year. Now, with the efforts of all navigation workers, we not only have night navigation beacons along the route, but also the beacons along 411 li have been electrified (together with the past, more than 700 kilometers of beacons have been electrified). This greatly illustrates the navigation of ships and accelerates the turnover of ships.

In the Great Leap Forward last year, the vast number of employees worked hard, cleverly, and self-reliantly to meet difficulties and overcome difficulties. Where did our enthusiasm come from? The leadership of the Party is the source of our strength. The Party led us in rectification and the struggle against right-wing elements. In political movements and in communist education, we were tempered, our political awareness was greatly improved, we broke superstitions, and we emancipated our minds.

Created the Highest Monthly Output in the History of Yangtze River Shipping, Holding High the Red Flag and Advancing Victoriously

The Party's general line for socialism guides the direction of our progress, and the Party's concern and support are the greatest encouragement to us. Last March, Chairman Mao had a cordial conversation with us on the Jiangxia Wheel, expressing great concern for our work and life. This conversation greatly encouraged all of our water transport workers, and it is unforgettable for me. Every time I think about it, I am full of energy.

With the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the difficulties facing the people of our country will inevitably be overcome, and the tasks will surely be completed.

This year is a year of continued Great Leap Forward in our country. The Party and the state have put forward a national economic plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. It is a magnificent plan for continued leap forward, which fully conforms to the wishes and requirements of the people of our country.

In order to realize a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, at the end of February, the Yangtze River's entire workforce held a mobilization meeting. Everyone expressed their determination, made guarantees to the Party, and launched four modernizations: automation of driving operations, mechanization of heavy labor, scientification of operation and management, and multi-skilled technology for everyone. Three Goods: good potential exploitation, good maintenance and repair, and good savings in raw materials and fuel. One elimination: eliminate accidents and guarantee the technical revolution of safe quality.

In the battle of March, everyone was full of enthusiasm and high enthusiasm, carried forward the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration, created unprecedented achievements, and overfulfilled the March plan, completing more than 160,000 tons of cargo volume and more than 1.13 billion kilometers of cargo turnover for the whole month, creating the highest monthly output in the history of Yangtze River shipping. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the water transport workers are making persistent efforts, holding high the red flag, and advancing victoriously. We will, together with the working class and the people of the whole country, continue to exert our efforts, strive for the top, and guarantee a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward to strive to overfulfill the national economic plan for 1959.

### 长江航运职工斗志昂扬  莫家瑞委员的发言

专栏：

    长江航运职工斗志昂扬
    莫家瑞委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告。
    这些报告深刻地分析了和全面地总结了四年来，特别是一九五八年，我国社会主义建设的伟大成就。从我们的实际斗争中和现实生活中，深深地体会到这些报告的正确。
    一九五八年，长江航运职工提前完成了第三本账，货运量比一九五七年增长百分之三十一，货运周转量增长了百分之二十一。可是这还不能完全说明跃进情况。去年下半年，特别八月以后，水运方面，突然地出现了来势猛、任务重、时间紧的局面。
    全体职工，在党的领导下，发出了响亮的口号：“以钢为纲”，当好“先行”，钢元帅需要运什么，我们就运什么，需要运到那里，我们就运到那里，干劲冲天，斗志昂扬。结果九月至十二月货运量比一九五七年同期增长百分之五十六，货运周转量增长百分之三十。
    完成这么繁重的任务不是没有困难的。运力增加赶不上运量增长的需要。任务越重，这一矛盾越突出。然而困难吓不倒我们，挡不住我们胜利前进的道路。
    运用苏联先进经验充分发挥船舶马力
    党的社会主义建设总路线照耀我们前进的道路。运力不足，我们就大闹技术革命，千方百计地挖掘船舶潜力。港口方面，大力提高装卸效率，缩短船舶停泊时间，以加速船舶周转。机动船舶方面解放马力，解放吨位，从而增加马力约四万匹，约为原有马力的百分之四十，增加载重八万八千吨。这些马力和吨位，如按新建船舶计算，约需投资五千万元。
    我们还充分发挥了船舶的马力，运用苏联的先进经验顶推法。青年号曾下水顶推十三艘铁驳。遥远自动操纵试验成功，驾驶、轮机合一，船上的重大变革已经开始，顶推法即将有很大的发展，船舶潜力亦将进一步发挥出来。
    谁都知道，川江有许多名胜古迹，但是，过去干航运的人，一提长江的这一段航运，这一段就是头痛，这是因为道路曲折，暗礁很多，水流汹涌湍急，河道中漩涡、回流泡水，水势很坏，共有大小险滩几十处，有些地方航行条件很坏，如青滩、泄滩等，有时滩上滩下水位高低相差很大。在崆岭一段尤其险恶，航道又狭，又弯曲，水又坏。所以从前有人说，“青滩、泄滩不算滩，崆岭才是鬼门关”。
    然而滩险难不倒毛泽东时代的航运人员。从解放以来，我就在川江驾驶船舶，就已安全航行了四十万公里。日夜航行顶推，在去年大跃进中已成为普遍现象。现在，在全体航道工作人员的努力下，我们不仅在沿线都有夜航灯标，而且四百一十一里的灯标已电气化了（连同过去，已有七百多公里灯标电气化）。这就大大地说明了船舶的航行，加速了船舶的周转。
    在去年大跃进中，广大职工苦干、巧干、自力更生，迎接困难，战胜困难。我们的干劲那里来的呢？党的领导是我们力量的泉源。党领导我们整风，进行反对右派分子的斗争，在政治运动中，在共产主义教育中，我们得到了锻炼，政治觉悟有了很大提高，破除迷信，解放思想。
    创造了长江航运史上最高月产量，高举红旗，乘胜前进
    党的社会主义总路线指导我们前进的方向，党的关心与支持，对我们是最大的鼓舞。去年三月在江峡轮上，毛主席就曾和我们作过亲切的谈话，对我们的工作和生活，他老人家表示极大的关怀。这次谈话大大鼓舞了我们全体水运职工，对我来说，更是终身难忘。每一想起就浑身是劲。
    有了党和毛主席的英明领导，摆在我国人民面前的困难必然能够克服，任务必定完成。
    今年是我国继续大跃进的一年，党和国家提出了以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国民经济计划。它是个宏伟的继续跃进计划，完全符合我国人民的愿望和要求。
    为了实现一九五九年更大、更好、更全面的跃进，二月底，长江全线职工举行了誓师大会，大家表示了决心，向党提出了保证，展开了四化：驾驶操作自动化，繁重劳动机械化，操作管理科学化，人人技术多面化。三好：潜力挖掘好，养护修理好，原材燃料节约好。一消灭：消灭事故，保证安全质量的技术革命运动。
    在三月份大战中，人人干劲冲天，热情高涨，发扬了共产主义大协作的精神，创造了空前战绩，超额完成了三月份计划，全月共完成了货运量十六万多吨，货运周转量十一亿三千万多公里，创造了长江航运史上有史以来的最高月产量。现在水运职工在党的领导下，再接再厉，高举红旗，乘胜前进，我们将和全国工人阶级、全国人民一起，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，保证以更大、更好、更全面地跃进，争取超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划。
