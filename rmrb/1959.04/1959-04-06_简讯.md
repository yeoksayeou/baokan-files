	Songhua River Opens Early
	The ice-sealed Songhua River, after five months, has thawed and opened for navigation. At noon on the 3rd, the passenger and cargo ship "Siping" set sail from Harbin, fully loaded with passengers and goods, heading upstream to Zhaoyuan and Dalai in Jilin Province. This year, the Songhua River thawed and opened twelve days earlier than in previous years, a first in fifty years.

	Plastic Mailbox
	Employees of the Lushun Post and Telecommunications Bureau successfully trial-produced plastic mailboxes using bittern, talc powder, sawdust, bittern and other materials. Mass production is now underway.

	One Printing Cylinder Prints Eight-Color Cloth
	The Lixin Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory in Wuxi City successfully used one printing cylinder to print eight-color floral fabric in a single pass. This not only doubles the efficiency of the machines but also avoids defects such as splashing, detachment, and uneven pressure caused by multi-cylinder production, reducing the labor intensity of workers.
