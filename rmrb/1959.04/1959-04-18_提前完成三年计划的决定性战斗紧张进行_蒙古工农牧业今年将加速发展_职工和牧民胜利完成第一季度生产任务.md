Ulan Bator, April 17 (By our reporter) -- 1959 is a year of decisive significance for Mongolia to realize the 1958-1960 three-year plan. The 1959 national fiscal budget approved by the Third Session of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia not long ago shows that Mongolia's national economy and cultural construction will be greatly developed this year.

Mongolia's national budget revenue for this year is 815.3 million Tugriks (Mongolian currency), an increase of 5.5% over the completed budget revenue of last year. This year's national budget expenditure is 809.9 million Tugriks, an increase of 13.2% over the completed budget expenditure of last year.

From the allocation of this year's national budget expenditures, we can see Mongolia's determination to further accelerate the pace of socialist construction. The budget expenditure for developing the national economy is 350.4 million Tugriks, and the expenditure for developing social and cultural aspects is 312.3 million Tugriks. These two expenditures account for 81.8% of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 11.5% compared with last year.

Among the budget expenditures for developing the national economy, the appropriation for developing agricultural and animal husbandry production is 111.7 million Tugriks, an increase of 12.6 million Tugriks compared with last year, which shows Mongolia's emphasis on vigorously developing agricultural and animal husbandry production. According to the recently revised three-year plan, Mongolia should vigorously develop agriculture while developing animal husbandry. By 1960, the cultivated area should be expanded to 257,200 hectares, an increase of more than 50,000 hectares compared with the original plan. The area of land reclamation and cultivation this year has also increased. This is a major measure to meet domestic grain needs and establish a solid feed base to further develop animal husbandry production. In terms of industry, a number of factories and enterprises will be built, expanded, renovated and rebuilt this year. The planned expenditure for industrial construction funds is 103.1 million Tugriks.

The state's total investment in capital construction in 1959 has increased significantly compared with last year, with a planned investment of 291 million Tugriks, an increase of 25.2% compared with last year.

While vigorously developing the national economy, the state will allocate a large amount of funds to develop social and cultural undertakings. This year's budget expenditure for social and cultural aspects has increased by 51.4 million Tugriks compared with last year, an increase of 19.7%.

As in the past, the basic income of the national budget this year is mainly the income of the socialist economic sector, which is expected to be 750 million Tugriks, an increase of 52 million Tugriks compared with last year, accounting for 92% of the budget revenue. This year's tax revenue is 65.3 million Tugriks, a decrease of 9.7 million Tugriks compared with last year, accounting for 8% of the budget revenue. The reduction in tax revenue will increase the income of the Mongolian people. The annual increase in Mongolia's national budget revenue is the result of the increase in the number of livestock and the further increase in the output of livestock products and industrial output. This fact fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist economic system. Mongolia's fiscal revenue is based on a solid and reliable booming economic foundation.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator -- Encouraged by the slogan of striving to complete the three-year plan ahead of schedule, Mongolian workers and the broad masses of herdsmen have excellently completed the production tasks for the first quarter of this year.

Mongolia's largest coal mine, the Nalaikha Coal Mine, completed the first quarter's coal production plan ahead of schedule on March 25, and exceeded the coal mining by 10,000 tons. The State Printing Plant overfulfilled the first quarter's production plan by 7.2%, and also saved the state 7,000 Tugriks. The Mongolian Industrial Union Factory, the Ulan Bator Central Heating and Power Plant, the Dongbaiyin Oil Mine, and the transportation and handicraft production departments in many provinces have all successfully completed the first quarter's production plan.

After the basic realization of agricultural and animal husbandry cooperation throughout the country, Mongolian herdsmen have achieved the first victory in the key work of lambing and protecting lambs to increase livestock. From the beginning of this year to the beginning of April, according to incomplete statistics, more than 2.44 million lambs have been delivered throughout the country, with a survival rate of 96.5%.

Mongolia's workers and herdsmen are now widely discussing the recently adopted revised three-year (1958-1960) plan, and have expressed their determination to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the tasks assigned by the Party.

　　提前完成三年计划的决定性战斗紧张进行
　　蒙古工农牧业今年将加速发展
　　职工和牧民胜利完成第一季度生产任务
    本报乌兰巴托17日电　1959年是蒙古实现1958—1960年三年计划有决定性意义的一年。不久前蒙古大人民呼拉尔第三次会议批准的1959年国家财政预算，说明了蒙古今年的国民经济和文化建设事业将有很大发展。
    蒙古今年的国家预算收入为八亿一千五百三十万图格里克（蒙币）；比去年预算收入的完成数字增加5.5％。今年国家预算支出为八亿零九百九十万图格里克，比去年预算支出完成数增加13.2％。
    从今年国家预算支出的分配情况，可以看到蒙古进一步加快社会主义建设速度的决心。预算支出用于发展国民经济的拨款是三亿五千零四十万图格里克，用于发展社会文化方面的拨款是三亿一千二百三十万图格里克，这两项支出占整个预算支出总额的81.8％，比去年增加了11.5％。
    在发展国民经济的预算支出中，对发展农牧业生产的拨款是一亿一千一百七十万图格里克，比去年增加一千二百六十万图格里克，这表明蒙古对大力发展农牧业生产的重视。按最近修订的三年计划规定，蒙古在发展牧业生产的同时，要大力发展农业。到1960年，耕地面积要扩大到二十五万七千二百公顷，比原计划增加了五万多公顷。今年的开荒和耕种面积也增加了。这是满足国内粮食需要和建立巩固的饲料基地进一步发展牧业生产的重大措施。工业方面，今年要兴建和扩建改建一批工厂企业。工业的建设资金预定支出一亿零三百一十万图格里克。
    1959年国家对基本建设的总投资比去年有了显著的增加，预定投资两亿九千一百万图格里克，比去年增加25.2％。
    在大力发展国民经济的同时，国家将拨出大批款项发展社会文化事业，今年对社会文化方面的预算支出比去年增加了五千一百四十万图格里克，即增加19.7％。
    像过去一样，今年国家预算的基本收入主要是社会主义经济部门的收入，预计为七亿五千万图格里克，比去年增加五千二百万图格里克占预算收入的92％。今年的税收额为六千五百三十万图格里克，比去年减少九百七十万图格里克，占预算收入的8％。税收减少将使蒙古人民的收入有所增加。蒙古国家预算收入的逐年增加，是由于耕畜头数的增殖和畜产品产量、工业产量进一步增加的结果。这个事实充分表明了社会主义经济制度的优越性。蒙古的财政收入是建立在稳固可靠的蓬勃发展的经济基础上的。
    据新华社乌兰巴托电　在争取提前完成三年计划口号的鼓舞下，蒙古职工和广大牧民出色地完成了今年第一季度的生产任务。
    蒙古最大的煤矿——那来河煤矿提前在3月25日完成了第一季度的产煤计划，并且超额采煤一万吨。国家印刷厂超额7.2％完成了第一季度生产计划，同时还为国家节约了七千图格里克的资金。蒙古工业联合工厂、乌兰巴托中央热电站、东白音石油矿、以及许多省的交通运输和手工业生产部门都很好地完成了第一季度的生产计划。
    在全国基本上实现了农牧业合作化以后，蒙古牧民在接羔保羔这一增殖牲畜的关键性的工作中取得了第一个胜利，从今年开始到4月上旬的不完全统计，全国已接产幼羔二百四十四万多头，成活率达到96.5％。
    蒙古的职工和牧民现在正在广泛讨论最近通过的修订后的三年（1958—1960）计划，并表示决心，保证完成和超额完成党交给的任务。
