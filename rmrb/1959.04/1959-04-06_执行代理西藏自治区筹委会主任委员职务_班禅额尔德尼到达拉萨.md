Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th: Panchen Erdeni, the Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, arrived in Lhasa from Xigaze this afternoon.

Panchen Erdeni's visit to Lhasa this time is to implement the State Council's order of March 28 regarding the dissolution of the Tibet local government, the exercise of the functions and powers of the Tibet local government by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the appointment of Panchen Erdeni as the Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee during the Dalai Lama's abduction. He will preside over the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region after it exercises the functions and powers of the Tibet local government, and will then travel from here to Beijing to attend the first session of the Second National People's Congress.

At 3:10 p.m., Panchen Erdeni arrived by car at the square below Drepung Monastery in the western suburbs of Lhasa, where he was warmly welcomed by Zhang Guohua, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and Commander of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army; Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Political Commissar of the Military Region; Apei A Wang Jinmei, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region; Zhou Renshan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Zhan Huayu, Deputy Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region; Deng Shaodong and Sampo Tenzin Dondup, Deputy Commanders; Langdun Gongga Wangqiu, Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region; Dingjie Living Buddha, Deputy Director of the Religious Affairs Committee; and Gyaco Lamu Living Buddha, Vice President of the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China.

Also present to warmly welcome Panchen Erdeni were all Tibetan and Han staff members of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in Lhasa, Tibetan and Han cadres from various Lhasa agencies, students from Lhasa Middle School, personnel from various people's organizations and the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, and Muslims from Lhasa.

As Panchen Erdeni stepped out of the car with a smiling face, the band played welcoming music, and several young people ran up to present him with flowers. Zhang Guohua, Tan Guansan, Apei A Wang Jinmei, Zhou Renshan, Zhan Huayu, Deng Shaodong, Sampo Tenzin Dondup, and others presented hadas to Panchen Erdeni, and Panchen Erdeni also returned hadas to them. Subsequently, accompanied by the welcomers, Panchen Erdeni entered a specially erected welcome tent to rest.

Panchen Erdeni had a cordial conversation with everyone. Zhang Guohua told him that the peaceful order in Lhasa had recovered quickly and that everything was gradually returning to normal. He welcomed Grand Master Panchen to preside over the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercising the functions and powers of the Tibet local government before attending the first session of the Second National People's Congress in Beijing.

Panchen Erdeni expressed his deep gratitude for everyone's welcome and said he was very pleased with the rapid restoration of peaceful order in Lhasa. He said that this time in Lhasa, he must take good responsibility for the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. He said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Tibet will have a bright future not only in quelling the rebellion but also in all aspects.

Panchen Erdeni once again expressed his concern for the situation of the Dalai Lama, who was abducted by traitors. After resting, Panchen Erdeni traveled by car to the new palace of Xueselin, where he will reside and work.

Along the way, many Lhasa citizens burned pine branches to pay homage to him.

Panchen Erdeni's car passed by the north side of Norbulingka and the foot of the Potala Palace, places where rebels were entrenched half a month ago. Now, the dense willows in Norbulingka are a lush green, the Potala Palace stands tall in the brilliant sunshine, and the ancient city of Lhasa is filled with a peaceful, new spring. Panchen Erdeni seemed very happy with these new scenes. (Photo attached)
