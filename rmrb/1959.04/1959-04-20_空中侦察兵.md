    The Civil Aviation Survey Team's aircraft are highly active on the industrial and agricultural production fronts, "building bridges and paving roads" for socialist construction, becoming a capable and agile "airborne scout."
    During the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the railway department, in order to facilitate transportation between the southwestern provinces and the interior and accelerate the flow of materials, decided to build a railway trunk line between Guiyang and Rongfeng. However, this area is located in towering mountains and ridges, with dangerous cliffs and high terrain, making it very difficult to select a safe and economical route in a short period of time.
    In early 1958, at the request of the railway department, the Civil Aviation Survey Brigade sent aircraft deep into the mountains to conduct aerial photography between Guiyang and Rongfeng. In just two months, they completed a large-scale survey of 3,225 square kilometers and produced a detailed topographic map. Because the topographic data provided by aerial photography was very accurate and reliable, the railway department was able to compare it according to the map and comprehensively consider it, and quickly determined a reasonable route. The route selected based on aerial photography was 36 kilometers shorter than the original route planned based on ground surveys, which could save 14.4 million yuan in project investment. Moreover, after the railway is completed, the shorter transport distance will greatly save transportation time and reduce transportation costs.
    During the upsurge of the nationwide steelmaking campaign last year, Baotou Iron and Steel Company planned to carry out large-scale expansion in order to further improve its production capacity. However, at that time it was the rainy season, and the water level of the Yellow River rose sharply. Due to the unclear water situation, Baotou Steel's expansion plan was affected, and production could not proceed normally. Under this emergency, the Civil Aviation Survey Team promptly sent an aircraft to Baotou to conduct aerial photography of the flood area, producing a detailed water condition map for Baotou Steel. This water condition map covered an area of 465 square kilometers, and the photography time only took one hour and thirty minutes. Baotou Iron and Steel Company determined the location of the Yellow River channel during the flood season from the water condition map, and then quickly formulated a correct expansion plan.
    With the rapid advancement of the country's socialist construction, the "airborne scouts" have also traveled all over the country. Last year, they measured wasteland in the Beidahuang reclamation area, selected sites for the construction of large-scale hydropower stations in the Nijiang River basin, surveyed forest resources in remote mountainous areas, and conducted comprehensive surveys in vast plains, making outstanding contributions to national construction and receiving praise from all sides.

    民用航空测量队的飞机，在工业和农业生产战线上十分活跃，为社会主义建设“架桥开路”，成为一支精干灵巧的“空中侦察兵”。
    在工农业生产大跃进中，铁道部门为了便利西南各省和内地之间的交通来往，加速物资流转，决定在贵阳—榕峰之间修建一条铁路干线。但是，这个地段处在崇山峻岭之中，危崖林立，地势高险，要在短时间内选定一条安全、经济的路线，的确很不容易。
    1958年初，民用航空测量大队应铁道部门的要求，派飞机深入群山腹地，在贵阳—榕峰之间进行空中摄影，只用两个月的时间，就完成了三千二百二十五平方公里的大面积测量，制成了一幅详细的地形图。由于航空摄影提供的地形资料十分准确可靠，铁道部门能够按图比较，全面考虑，很快就确定了一条合理的路线。根据航空摄影选定的这条路线，比原来根据地面测量规划的路线要短三十六公里，可以节省工程投资一千四百四十万元，而且在铁路建成以后，由于运程缩短，将大大节省运输时间，降低运输成本。
    在去年全民炼钢的热潮中，包头钢铁公司为了进一步提高生产能力，计划进行大规模的扩建。但是，当时正逢雨季，黄河水位猛升，由于对水势不明，使包钢的扩建计划受到影响，生产不能正常进行。在这种紧急的情况下，民用航空测量队及时派了飞机来到包头，对涨水区域进行航空摄影，为包钢摄制了一幅水情详图。这幅水情图包括周围四百六十五平方公里的地区，摄影时间只花了一小时三十分钟。包头钢铁公司从水情图上判明了黄河在涨水季节的河床位置，于是很快拟订了一个正确的扩建规划。
    随着国家社会主义建设的突飞猛进，“空中侦察兵”的踪迹也遍及到全国各地。去年，他们在北大荒垦区测量荒地，在泥江流域为修建大型的水电站选择地点，在边远的山区调查森林资源，在辽阔的原野进行综合勘测，为国家建设屡建战功，受到了各方面的赞扬。
