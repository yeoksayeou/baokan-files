Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, Sichuan Province: Since last year, more than 1,500 primary and secondary school teachers in Sichuan Province have honorably joined the Communist Party of China.

The primary and secondary school teachers who were admitted to the Party have all been tested by the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, and are advanced elements who actively implement the Party's education policy. Yao Fangpu, a chemistry teacher at Chengdu No. 15 Middle School who was admitted to the Party at the end of last year, has shown an active attitude and firm position in various political movements. Last year, when the school launched a work-study program, she and her students overcame many difficulties and established a cardboard factory as a base for the school to implement the work-study program, which was praised by teachers and loved by students. Recently, she was selected as an advanced worker in the city. Hao Rongde, the principal of Yuquan Street Primary School in Chengdu, has been engaged in primary school education for decades and has always loved education. After liberation, she actively safeguarded the interests of the Party and earnestly implemented the Party's policies. She was admitted to the Party at the end of last year. Since last year, more than 170 primary and secondary school and kindergarten teachers in Chongqing have been admitted to the Party. Song Biqiu, the director of a street kindergarten who was admitted to the Party, has consistently been loyal to the Party's cause for several years and has worked actively and excellently. She was once selected as an advanced producer in Chongqing and attended the National Women's Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction.

Before these new Party members joined the Party, they all underwent serious review and education by the Party organization. Party organizations in various places absorbed them to listen to Party lectures, organized them to study the Party Constitution, and conducted individual education for them to help them overcome shortcomings and improve their ideological awareness. Some middle schools in Chengdu and other places also held amateur Party schools to conduct more systematic Party education for them.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th: Since last year, 750 outstanding primary and secondary school teachers in the Shijiazhuang area of Hebei Province have honorably joined the Communist Party of China.

Among these new Party members, there are old teachers who have served in education for many years, as well as young teachers. They all love the people's education cause, work diligently, and have been tempered and tested by various political movements. Wang Baocheng, a history teacher at Shijiazhuang No. 6 Middle School, usually attaches great importance to the study of political theory and the study of his profession, and the quality of teaching has been continuously improved. He prepares carefully before each lesson and patiently guides during the lesson. If individual students perform poorly, he uses his spare time to help them with remedial lessons until all the students understand. He was also very active in his work as the leader of the group that compiled the history teaching syllabus for middle schools in the city. He not only works well, but also labors well. He was rated as an activist when he participated in the construction of the Huangbizhuang Reservoir. Zhang Jiaju, a teacher at Hengshui County Middle School, teaches Chinese to two classes and is also a class teacher for one class. The class he was responsible for originally did not have good academic performance and had poor discipline. After he became one with the students, strengthened contact with the students' families and villages, gradually grasped the students' ideological situation, and patiently taught them, the class made great progress in all aspects. Zhang Jiaju often thinks about how to teach students well and studies his profession assiduously, and his work performance is outstanding. Last year, he attended the county model worker conference and won a certificate of merit issued by the county. Kou Sitong, a teacher at Jinzhou Xiguan Primary School in Shulu County, is considerate of students everywhere and cares about their studies. Under the premise of ensuring the completion of teaching tasks, he also often leads students to participate in some physical labor in their spare time to cultivate primary school students' habit of loving labor.

Party organizations at all levels in the Shijiazhuang area attach great importance to helping primary and secondary school teachers improve their political awareness. The county party committees of various counties have adopted the method of large-scale concentration or small-scale joint meetings to regularly organize primary and secondary school teachers to study current affairs and the Party's education policy and other policies and policies to help them strive for self-transformation, so that the broad masses of primary and secondary school teachers can closely keep up with the leap-forward development of the country's socialist construction situation in ideological awareness. On the basis of the rectification movement, the Party organization also organized primary and secondary school teachers to study the basic knowledge of the Party, and absorbed non-Party teachers to attend plenary meetings of all Party members or the admission ceremony of new Party members. Through these methods, their political awareness was further improved.

    积极贯彻党的教育方针　勤勤恳恳从事教育事业
    四川省和石家庄一批中小学教师入党
    新华社成都电　四川省去年以来有一千五百多名中、小学教师光荣地加入中国共产党。
    被吸收入党的中、小学教师都经过整风运动和反右派斗争的考验，并且是积极贯彻党的教育方针的先进分子。去年年底被吸收入党的成都第十五中学化学教师姚芳璞在各项政治运动中表现积极，立场坚定，去年学校开展勤工俭学活动，她和学生们一起克服了许多困难，办起了一个纸板厂，作为学校实行勤工俭学的基地，受到教师的赞扬和学生的爱戴。最近她被选为全市的先进工作者。成都市玉泉街小学校长郝容德，做了几十年小学教育工作，一贯热爱教育事业，解放后，她积极维护党的利益，认真执行党的方针、政策，去年年底被吸收入党。重庆市去年以来被吸收入党的中、小学和幼儿园教师有一百七十多人。被吸收入党的街道幼儿园园长宋碧秋几年来一贯忠于党的事业，工作积极、出色，曾经被选为重庆市先进生产者和出席全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议的代表。
    这些新党员入党前，都经过党组织的认真审查和教育。各地党组织曾吸收他们听党课，组织他们学习党章，并对他们进行个别教育，帮助他们克服缺点，提高思想觉悟。成都等地一些中学还举办业余党校，对他们进行比较系统的党的教育。
    新华社天津8日电　河北省石家庄地区去年以来有七百五十名优秀中小学教师光荣地加入中国共产党。
    在这批新党员中，有服务教育工作多年的老教师，也有青年教师。他们都热爱人民教育事业，在工作中勤勤恳恳，并且经过历次政治运动的锻炼和考验。石家庄市第六中学历史教师王宝成，平时很重视政治理论学习和钻研业务，教学质量不断提高。他每讲一课之前都认真作好准备，在讲课时耐心诱导。如有个别学生成绩不好，他就利用课余时间帮助补习，直到学生全部弄懂为止。他在担任全市中等学校编写历史教学大纲的组长期间，工作也很积极。他不但工作好，劳动也好，曾在参加修建黄壁庄水库时被评为积极分子。衡水县中学教师张家驹，担任着两个班的语文课，并兼任一个班的班主任。他负责的那个班，原来学习成绩不够好，纪律也比较差。经过他同学生们打成一片，加强同学生家庭所在村的联系，逐步掌握了学生们的思想情况，耐心教导，这样就使这个班在各方面都有了很大进步。张家驹每天常想的都是怎样教好学生，刻苦地钻研业务，工作成绩很出色。去年他出席全县模范工作者会议，荣获了县里发给的奖状。束鹿县晋州西关小学教师寇思童，处处体贴学生，关心学生们的学习。在保证完成教学任务的前提下，他还经常带领学生在课余时间参加一些体力劳动，培养小学生爱劳动的习惯。
    石家庄地区各级党组织非常重视帮助中小学教师提高政治觉悟。各县县委采取大集中或小片联合的方法，定期组织中小学教师学习时事和党的教育工作方针和其他各项方针政策，帮助他们努力进行自我改造，从而使广大中小学教师在思想觉悟上紧紧跟上祖国社会主义建设形势的飞跃发展。在整风运动的基础上，党组织又组织中小学教师们学习党的基本知识，吸收党外教师列席全体党员大会或新党员入党仪式，通过这些方式，进一步提高了他们的政治觉悟。
