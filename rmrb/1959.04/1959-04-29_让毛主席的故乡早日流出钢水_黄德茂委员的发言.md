Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of the leading comrades, and I will conscientiously implement them in my future work.

    I am a steel reinforcing worker with over thirty years of experience. I used to work at the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Industry Company, and was transferred to Hunan last year to build the Xiangtan Iron and Steel Company. In 1952, I created the steel reinforcing assembly line method and improved fourteen kinds of steel reinforcing bending tools, turning manual operations into mechanization. As a result, I was rated as a special-class labor model in Anshan City and participated in the National Advanced Producers Representative Conference and the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In 1956, I was promoted to deputy director of the steel reinforcing workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Industry Company. All these honors and positions were given to me by the Party. Without the Party's cultivation, education, and assistance, I would not have been able to achieve these results in my work, nor would I have received so many honors. These achievements should be attributed to the Party and to everyone.

    In March 1958, based on the needs of our national construction, I and some other comrades from our company were transferred from the Northeast to Hunan to build the Xiangtan Iron and Steel Company. When we heard this news, we were extremely happy. Because Xiangtan, Hunan, is Chairman Mao's hometown, and it did not produce steel in the past. Now we are asked to participate in the construction of Chairman Mao's hometown and build the first iron and steel company there with our own hands. What a glorious and historically significant task this is! Therefore, we all determined to go all out and build the Xiangtan Iron and Steel Company as soon as possible, so that steel would flow from Chairman Mao's hometown soon. After arriving in Xiangtan, we immediately plunged into intense labor. All cadres and technicians worked with the laborers to level the ground and carry soil to prepare for the start of construction. On July 1st, the Xiangtan Iron and Steel Company officially started construction. During the construction, all employees were full of energy and enthusiasm. Because it often rained in Hunan, in order to prevent the rain from affecting the progress of the project, we put forward the slogan "Seize sunny days, grasp cloudy days, treat light rain as good weather; don't stop working in heavy rain, work harder in light rain, one sunny day is worth two days." When pouring the concrete foundation for blast furnaces No. 1 and No. 2, we shortened the original plan of thirty hours to twenty-one hours by adopting rapid construction methods, creating a new national record for pouring large blast furnace concrete foundations. With the efforts of all employees, by December, in addition to completing the concrete foundation pouring project for blast furnaces No. 1 and No. 2, we had basically built four workshops: steel wire, steel rope, machine repair, and rivet forging, so that these workshops were put into production first, and the annual output value plan was overfulfilled by 165%. Now, we are accelerating the construction of coke ovens No. 1 and No. 2, coal storage towers, rolling mill, blooming mill, and iron ore mines, striving to produce iron and steel as soon as possible.

    When I attended the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1956, Chairman Mao talked to me. He was very concerned about the health and production of our workers. After that meeting, I kept Chairman Mao's words firmly in mind. In addition to paying attention to physical health, I also worked with comrades in our workshop to research and create a small rolling mill to roll steel bars using scrap steel plates. This not only saved the country's wealth but also solved the difficulty of insufficient steel supply. Last year, when building the Xiangtan Iron and Steel Company, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient material supply and build Chairman Mao's hometown steel plant faster, I suggested to the leadership to use the past experience in the Northeast to manufacture small rolling mills and roll the required steel bars ourselves. After this suggestion was approved by the leadership, I and the comrades in the workshop began designing in August. With the care of the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel and the brotherly support of the old hero Meng Tai, the small rolling mill was completed on January 25th this year and officially put into production. Now, we are preparing to further manufacture cold drawing machines, cold drawing pipe machines, and nail making machines in order to save more wealth for the country and put the Xiangtan Iron and Steel Company into production as soon as possible.

    Some of the workers in our company are from the Northeast, and some are locals from Hunan. Therefore, we have paid close attention to strengthening the unity between workers from the North and South, and between old and new workers. At the same time, we have also vigorously strengthened the work of training new workers. In our workshop alone, we trained twenty steel reinforcing technicians and fourteen rolling mill workers last year, and we plan to continue training sixteen rolling mill workers and thirty steel reinforcing workers this year so that the technical force will grow rapidly. With the new technical force, Chairman Mao's hometown can be built faster and better.

    Committee members, the task we are undertaking now is very glorious. We have the confidence and determination to build the steel plant faster and better under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    Just as the people of the whole country are striving with soaring enthusiasm to realize the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 proposed by the Party Central Committee, the upper-class reactionary clique in the Tibet region, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, betrayed the motherland and the people, and openly launched an armed rebellion in Lhasa. This is a violation of the interests of the people of the whole country, especially the interests of the monks and lay people of Tibet. I firmly support all the measures taken by the State Council to quell the rebellion in Tibet. I hope to completely eliminate the rebels in Tibet and realize a socialist New Tibet as soon as possible.

### 让毛主席的故乡早日流出钢水  黄德茂委员的发言

    让毛主席的故乡早日流出钢水
    黄德茂委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长报告，在今后工作中认真贯彻执行。
    我是一个做了三十多年工的钢筋工人，原来在鞍钢建筑工业公司工作，去年才调到湖南去建设湘潭钢铁公司。在一九五二年，我曾经创造过钢筋流水作业法，还改进了十四件弯钢筋的工具，使手工操作变成了机械化，因而被评为鞍山市的特等劳动模范，并参加了全国先进生产者代表会议和政协二届二次会议，一九五六年并提拔为鞍钢建筑工业公司钢筋车间的副主任。我的这些荣誉和地位，都是党给我的，没有党的培养教育和帮助，我在工作上是不能作出这些成绩来，也不会得到这么多荣誉的。这些成绩的取得应该归功于党，归功于大家。
    一九五八年三月，根据我们国家建设事业的发展的需要，我和我们公司的其它一些同志，从东北调到湖南去建设湘潭钢铁公司。当我们听到了这个消息后，感到万分高兴。因为湖南湘潭是毛主席的故乡，而这里过去是不出钢铁的。现在要我们参加毛主席故乡的建设，由我们亲手在那里建设起第一个钢铁公司来，这是一个多么光荣的和有历史意义的任务！因此，我们都下定决心，一定要鼓足干劲，尽快地把湘潭钢铁公司建设起来，让毛主席的故乡早日流出钢水来。到湘潭以后，我们立即投入了紧张的劳动，所有干部和技术工人，都与壮工在一起平地挑土，做好开工前的准备工作，到七月一日湘潭钢铁公司就正式开工兴建。在建设中间，我们全体职工干劲十足，热情高涨。由于湖南经常下雨，为了不致因下雨影响工程的进度，我们提出了“抢晴天、抓阴天，毛毛细雨当好天；大雨不停工，小雨加劲干，晴天一天顶两天”的口号。在浇灌一、二号高炉的混凝土基础时，由于我们采取了快速施工方法，由原计划三十个小时，缩短到二十一个小时，创造了全国浇灌大型高炉混凝土基础的新纪录。在全体职工的努力下，到十二月间，除了完成了浇灌一、二号高炉混凝土基础工程外，并基本建成了钢丝、钢绳、机修、铆锻四个车间，使这些车间先投入了生产，全年超额完成了百分之一百六十五的产值计划。现在，我们正在加快建设一、二号焦炉、贮煤塔、成材厂、初轧厂和修建铁矿，争取早日出铁出钢。
    一九五六年我参加政协二届二次会议时，毛主席同我谈过话，他很关心我们工人的健康和生产。在那次会议以后，我紧记住毛主席的这些话，除了注意身体的健康外，并和我们车间的同志一起研究创造了小型轧钢机，利用废钢板边子轧制钢筋，不但节约了国家财富，并解决了钢材供应不足的困难。去年在建设湘潭钢铁公司时，为了解决材料供应不足的困难，更快地把毛主席故乡的钢厂建设起来，我向领导上建议利用过去在东北的经验，制造小型轧钢机，自己轧制需要的钢筋。这个建议经领导上批准后，八月间我和车间同志就开始设计；在鞍钢领导上的关怀及孟泰老英雄兄弟般的支援下，在今年一月二十五日，小型轧钢机已经制成并正式投入生产。现在，我们准备进一步制造冷拔钢丝机、冷拔钢管机和制钉机，以便为国家节约更多的财富，并使湘潭钢铁公司早日投入生产。
    我们公司中有一部分是东北来的工人，有一部分是湖南本地人，因此，我们认真注意了加强南北工人、新老工人之间的团结，同时，还大力加强了培养新工人的工作。光是我们一个车间，在去年一年中已培养了二十名钢筋技术工人，十四名轧钢工人，并计划在今年继续培养十六名轧钢工人和三十名钢筋工人，使技术力量迅速成长起来。有了新的技术力量以后，毛主席的故乡也就能建设得更快、更好。
    各位委员：我们现在担负的任务是十分光荣的。我们有信心和决心在党和毛主席的领导下，把钢铁厂建设得更快更好。
    正当全国人民以冲天的干劲，为实现党中央所提出的一九五九年继续大跃进而奋斗的时候，西藏地区的上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，背叛祖国、背叛人民，公开在拉萨发动武装叛乱，这是违反全国人民的利益，首先是西藏僧俗人民的利益的。我坚决拥护国务院平定西藏叛乱的一切措施，希望彻底消灭西藏的叛乱分子，早日实现人民的社会主义的新西藏。
