Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates:

	I completely agree with the reports made to the Congress by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I firmly support Premier Zhou's decision in his report on completely quelling the rebellion in Tibet.

	For a long time, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique have been engaged in various criminal activities betraying the motherland. Especially since May and June of last year, the hidden rebellious elements have become even more rampant. They even established a "base area" in the Shannan area, accepted assistance from imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, organized rebellious armed forces, destroyed highways, destroyed vehicles, and ambushed the People's Liberation Army and working cadres entering Tibet. On March 10, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary elements openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement, launched an armed rebellion, and launched a full-scale attack on our army's troops stationed in Lhasa on the night of March 19. The rebellious elements inhumanly raped and plundered everywhere, cruelly harmed the people, and committed all kinds of evil. Under the banner of "protecting religion," they engaged in the shameless acts of burning temples, killing lamas, and raping nuns. The ugly faces of this small group of reactionary elements betraying the motherland, undermining unification, and undermining national unity have now been completely exposed. The crimes of the rebellious elements aroused the boundless anger of the broad masses of Tibetan people and officers and soldiers of our army stationed in Tibet. The masses in the Lhasa area are now rising up to accuse the rebels of their atrocities and requesting the People's Liberation Army to quickly quell the rebellion.

	The so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" distributed by Indian foreign affairs officials on April 18 is a thoroughly distorted, rumor-mongering, and extremely absurd document. It even said that "the Dalai Lama and his government have done their best to abide by the Seventeen-Article Agreement, but the Chinese authorities have been interfering," and that after the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, "the Tibetan government did not enjoy any degree of autonomy," etc. This is purely a rumor that completely reverses black and white. Since the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, it has faithfully fulfilled the Seventeen-Article Agreement, resolutely implemented the Party's national policy, respected the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people, sought the welfare of the Tibetan people in every possible way, and strived to help the Tibetan people carry out various construction work, which has won the enthusiastic support of the Tibetan people. And almost no Tibetan internal affairs were not handled by the former Tibetan local government. The facts of the past eight years have proved that it was precisely the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique themselves who consistently obstructed and undermined the implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement. The agreement stipulated that imperialist forces should be expelled from Tibet, but they colluded with imperialism; the agreement stipulated that the People's Liberation Army should be assisted in consolidating national defense, but they launched an armed rebellion and attacked the People's Liberation Army; the agreement stipulated that regional autonomy should be implemented under the unified leadership of the central government, but they undermined national unity and conspired to realize the "Tibetan independence" that imperialism wanted. In short, no fact can be found that the former Tibetan local government abided by the agreement.

	In order to safeguard the unity of the motherland and national unity, and to relieve the suffering of the people in the Tibetan region, our Tibet Military Region troops were ordered to suppress the rebels, quickly quell the rebellion in the Lhasa area, and then smash the rebel group in the area south of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and control the entire northern border line of our country in the Himalayas. In the battles to quell the rebellion, our army strictly abided by the various policies and disciplines stipulated in the Tibet Military Region's proclamation, and received the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of Tibetan people. The coerced elements left the rebel ranks one after another and returned home to production. At present, our army is continuing to wipe out the remaining rebels who are fleeing in remote areas. The evil conspiracy of the rebellious elements has suffered a shameful defeat, and a new page has been turned in the history of Tibet in the motherland.

	Tibet is Chinese territory, and the rebellion of Tibetan reactionary elements and the suppression of this rebellion are entirely China's internal affairs, and no outsiders are allowed to interfere. Our troops stationed in Tibet must, under the leadership of the Central Government, the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Tibet Military Region, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely wipe out the remaining bandits, safeguard the security and unity of the motherland, maintain the unity of all ethnic groups, and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet!

### 所谓达赖喇嘛的声明  纯系颠倒黑白的胡说  魏志英代表的发言

    所谓达赖喇嘛的声明  纯系颠倒黑白的胡说
    魏志英代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长向大会所作的各项报告，并且坚决拥护周总理在报告中指出的关于彻底平息西藏叛乱的决定。
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，长期以来就进行着背叛祖国的各种罪恶活动，特别从去年五、六月以后，潜藏的叛乱分子气焰更加嚣张，他们竟在山南地区建立“根据地”，接受帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的援助，组织叛乱武装，破坏公路，击毁汽车，伏击人民解放军和进藏的工作干部。三月十日，原西藏地方政府和上层反动分子，公开撕毁十七条协议，发动武装叛乱，并且在三月十九日夜间向我军驻拉萨部队发动了全面进攻。叛乱分子毫无人性地到处奸淫虏掠，残害人民，无恶不作，他们打着“保护宗教”的旗帜，干着焚烧寺庙，残杀喇嘛，奸淫尼姑的无耻勾当。这一小撮反动分子背叛祖国，破坏统一，破坏民族团结的丑恶面目，至此已暴露无遗。叛乱分子的罪行，激起了广大藏族人民和我军驻藏官兵的无比愤怒，拉萨地区的群众现在正纷纷起来控诉叛匪的暴行，请求解放军迅速平息叛乱。
    四月十八日由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，是一个彻头彻尾歪曲事实、造谣污蔑、极端荒谬的文件。其中竟说什么“达赖喇嘛和他的政府曾经尽最大力量来遵守十七条协议，但是中国当局一直进行干涉”，中国人民解放军进驻西藏后“西藏政府没有享受任何程度的自治”等等，这纯粹是颠倒黑白的胡说。人民解放军自进驻西藏以后，就完全忠实地履行了十七条协议，坚决地执行了党的民族政策，尊重藏族人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，处处为藏族人民谋福利，并努力帮助西藏人民进行了各项建设工作，获得了藏族人民的热烈拥护。而西藏内部的事务，几乎没有哪一件不是经由原西藏地方政府负责进行的。八年来的事实证明，一贯阻挠和破坏十七条协议执行的却正是原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团自己。协议规定要驱逐帝国主义势力出西藏，他们却勾结帝国主义，协议规定要协助人民解放军巩固国防，他们却发动武装叛乱，进攻解放军，协议规定要在中央统一领导下实行区域自治，他们却破坏祖国统一，阴谋实现帝国主义所要的“西藏独立”。总之，找不出任何一件原西藏地方政府遵守协议的事实。
    为了维护祖国统一和民族团结，解救西藏地区人民的痛苦，我西藏军区部队奉命讨伐叛逆，迅速平息了拉萨地区的叛乱，接着又粉碎了雅鲁藏布江以南地区的叛乱集团，控制了喜马拉雅山北部我国的全部国境线。在平叛战斗中，我军严格地遵守了西藏军区布告中所规定的各项政策纪律，得到了藏族广大人民的热烈支持，被裹胁的分子纷纷脱离叛匪队伍，回家生产。目前我军正继续肃清流窜在偏僻地区的残余叛乱分子。叛乱分子的罪恶阴谋已经遭到了可耻的失败，祖国西藏的历史已经翻开了新的一页。
    西藏是中国的领土，西藏反动分子的叛乱和这一叛乱的平定，完全是中国的内政，绝不容许任何外人干涉。我们驻藏部队官兵一定在中央、中共西藏工委和西藏军区的领导下，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清残余匪帮，保卫祖国的安全和统一，维护各族人民的团结，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗！
