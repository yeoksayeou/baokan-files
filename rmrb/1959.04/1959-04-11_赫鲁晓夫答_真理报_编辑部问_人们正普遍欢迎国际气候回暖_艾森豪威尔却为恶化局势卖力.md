　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 10th: TASS Moscow, April 10th: The editorial department of "Pravda" posed some questions to Khrushchev regarding the speech delivered by U.S. President Eisenhower in Gettysburg on April 4th. "Pravda" today published Khrushchev's responses to these questions.

　　Khrushchev said that the speech in Gettysburg cannot help but surprise people. Now people are generally welcoming the news that various countries have agreed to convene foreign ministers' meetings and high-level meetings to resolve outstanding international issues. Therefore, everyone feels that there is a certain warmth in the international atmosphere, and there is hope that national leaders may reach an agreement and that peace may be guaranteed. However, judging from various signs, not everyone is happy about this. Now, some people are trying to make nerves tense and intensify the situation. It cannot but be thought that President Eisenhower has also put in some effort in this regard.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that the U.S. President repeated in his speech almost all the main arguments that the most fanatical defenders of the "brink of war" policy have said to the Soviet Union more than once. Khrushchev emphasized, when talking about President Eisenhower's claim that there is some kind of danger from the Soviet Union, that the Soviet state has never had, and will never have, any aggressive intentions towards other countries. The sole and main goal of Soviet domestic policy is to create a life that conforms to the beautiful ideals of mankind. The sole and constant goal of Soviet foreign policy is to prevent war and ensure the peace and security of itself and all countries. Every step taken by the Soviet state in foreign policy, including the recent steps taken in the preparation for negotiations between East and West, vividly proves this point.

　　Khrushchev emphasized, when talking about the so-called U.S. joint "security guarantee" plan and Eisenhower's statement that this plan serves the purpose of maintaining peace, that this plan cannot serve the interests of guaranteeing peace. Khrushchev said that, in reality, the purpose of this plan is to enable the United States to rudely interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and to make other countries more closely dependent on the Western military bloc in which the United States plays a leading role.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet government hopes to solve the problem of eliminating mutual distrust and suspicion while ensuring the security of the Soviet Union without harming the security of other countries. He said that we hope to strengthen mutual trust and eliminate suspicion between countries. We believe that this can be achieved through peaceful coexistence, through the gradual resolution of disputed issues such as the German peace treaty and the status of West Berlin, and through reaching agreements on disarmament. This is the only reliable way to eliminate the "Cold War". We put internal conditions and domestic policy issues outside the scope of international relations. Lifestyle is the inalienable right of all peoples, and only experience will show which lifestyle is better.

　　Khrushchev said that, according to the speech in Gettysburg, it can be seen that the U.S. government is adhering to another position.

　　Khrushchev then talked about the Berlin issue mentioned by the U.S. President in his speech. Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union does not intend to take West Berlin from anyone, it only hopes to eliminate the tense situation in West Berlin and the dangerous source of possible military conflict. Khrushchev said that the issue now is to show patience and not do anything that might hinder the correct resolution of the Berlin issue and the German peace treaty issue and other pressing international issues in the interest of consolidating peace and taking into account the interests of all parties.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that Western leaders who create difficulties or hinder the upcoming negotiations at such an important historical juncture will bear serious responsibility to the people of all countries for the consequences that may arise as a result. Khrushchev emphasized that not to sharpen the situation, not to deepen the divisions between countries, but to seek ways to bring the positions of all parties closer and to seek necessary common solutions, this is what must be done first now.

　　赫鲁晓夫答“真理报”编辑部问
　　人们正普遍欢迎国际气候回暖
　　艾森豪威尔却为恶化局势卖力
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社莫斯科10日讯：“真理报”编辑部就美国总统艾森豪威尔4月4日在葛底斯堡发表的演说向赫鲁晓夫提出了一些问题。“真理报”今天刊载了赫鲁晓夫对这些问题的答复。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在葛底斯堡的演说不能不使人感到惊讶。现在人们普遍欢迎这样的消息：各国商定召开外长会议和高级会议来解决悬而未决的国际问题。因此，大家都感到在国际气氛中有了一定的暖气，出现了国家领导人可能达成协议以及和平可能得到保障的希望。但是，根据种种迹象判断，并不是所有的人都对这一点感到高兴。现在，有人企图使神经紧张起来，使局势白热化。不能不认为，艾森豪威尔总统在这方面也卖了一定的力气。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，“战争边缘”政策的最狂热的维护者不止一次地对苏联说过的那些主要论调，美国总统在自己的演说中差不多都加以重复。赫鲁晓夫在谈到艾森豪威尔总统说什么有来自苏联的某种危险的时候强调指出，苏维埃国家从来没有、也不会对其他国家抱有什么侵略意图。苏联国内政策的唯一的和主要的目标是，创造符合人类美好理想的生活。苏联的外交政策的唯一的、始终不变的目标是：防止战争，保障和平和本国以及所有国家的安全。苏维埃国家在外交政策方面所采取的每一个步骤，其中包括最近在东西方谈判的准备工作方面所采取的步骤，都生动地证明了这一点。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到所谓美国共同“保障安全”计划和艾森豪威尔所说这个计划服务于维护和平的目的这种说法时强调指出，这个计划不可能服务于保障和平的利益。赫鲁晓夫说，实际上，这个计划的目的是使美国粗暴地干涉别国的内政，是为了使其他国家更紧地依附于由美国扮演主要角色的西方国家军事集团中。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联政府希望在保障苏联的安全而又不损害别国安全的情况下，解决消除互不信任和互相猜疑的问题。他说，我们希望，国与国之间加强相互信任，消除猜疑。我们认为，通过和平共处，通过逐步解决对德和约、西柏林地位等争论问题以及就裁军问题达成协议等办法，可以做到这一点。这是消除“冷战”的唯一可靠的办法。我们把内部状况和国内政策问题放在国际关系范围之外。生活方式是各国人民的不可剥夺的权利，而只有经验才会表明，哪种生活方式更好。
    赫鲁晓夫说，根据在葛底斯堡的演说可以看出，美国政府所坚持的是另外一种立场。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了美国总统在演说中涉及的柏林问题。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联不打算从任何人手中夺取西柏林，它所希望的只是在西柏林消除紧张局势和可能发生军事冲突的危险策源地。赫鲁晓夫说，现在的问题是，要表现耐心，不做任何可能妨碍为了巩固和平并在考虑各方利益的情况下正确解决柏林问题以及对德和约问题等等迫切国际问题的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在如此重要的历史关头，制造困难或者阻碍即将开始的谈判的西方国家领导人必将对由此而可能产生的后果向各国人民负严重责任。赫鲁晓夫强调说，不使局势尖锐化，不加深国与国之间的分歧，而要寻求途径使各方立场接近，求得必要的共同解决的办法，这就是现在必须首先要做的事情。
