Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, April 1st: The Mongolian "Truth News" published a commentary today on the Tibetan rebellion, saying that the fact that the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique colluded with imperialism to launch a rebellion fully exposes the hideous faces of imperialism and the most reactionary serf owners in Tibet.

	The commentary said that the Mongolian people extremely despise the criminal acts of the Tibetan reactionary forces in colluding with imperialism in an attempt to split national unity and violate the interests of the Tibetan people.

	The commentary pointed out that the rebellion launched by the Tibetan reactionary forces has suffered a shameful defeat. This shows that the Tibetan people warmly support the Chinese Central People's Government's policies towards Tibet and support the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet. The commentary also said that the Mongolian people are deeply convinced that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the support of the monks and laypeople of Tibet, will completely crush the rebellion and quickly restore normal order in the Tibetan region.

	Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 1st: The Czechoslovak "People's Front" newspaper said in a commentary today on the rebellion of Tibetan reactionaries that the Tibetan people have always supported the policies of the Chinese Central People's Government, which for them means liberation and a happy and prosperous life.

	The newspaper said that the purpose of the recent open rebellion by agitators is clear. The rebels probably have not broken ties with Chiang Kai-shek, but they have no contact with the people. Therefore, this armed rebellion was quickly quelled.

	Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 1st: The Polish "Warsaw Life News" and "Voice of Labor" newspapers today published commentaries on the recent rebellion in Tibet.

	"Warsaw Life News" pointed out that Tibet has always been and is now a part of China. The newspaper wrote that the recent events in Tibet show that feudal forces and reactionary forces have not fallen asleep. But they have been defeated.

	"Voice of Labor" wrote that the calculations of the Tibetan rebels and their ringleaders were wrong.

	Because they did not receive the support of the masses and Tibetan patriots, the rebellion was crushed. The Chinese army restored order in Tibet. The attempt by the reactionaries, supported by imperialism, to turn back the wheel of history has once again suffered a defeat.

    帝国主义和西藏叛匪的阴谋失败了
    蒙捷波等国报纸支持我国平定西藏叛乱
    新华社乌兰巴托1日电　蒙古“真理报”今日就西藏叛乱事件发表评论说，中国西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义发动叛乱这一事实，充分暴露了帝国主义以及西藏最反动的农奴主的狰狞面目。
    评论说，蒙古人民极其鄙视西藏反动势力勾结帝国主义企图分裂国家统一、违反西藏人民利益的罪恶行为。
    评论指出，西藏反动势力发动的叛乱已经遭到可耻的失败。这表明，西藏人民是热烈拥护中国中央人民政府对西藏的政策，拥护中国人民解放军驻西藏部队的。评论还说，蒙古人民深信，中国人民解放军在西藏僧俗人民的支持下将彻底粉碎叛乱，迅速恢复西藏地区的正常秩序。
    新华社布拉格1日电　捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”今天在一篇评论西藏反动分子叛乱的文章中说，西藏人民一向支持中国中央人民政府的政策，这个政策对他们来说意味着解放和幸福而富裕的生活。
    这家报纸说，至于最近煽动者进行的公开叛乱的目的是清楚的。叛乱分子大概没有同蒋介石断绝连系，但他们和人民倒是没有联系的。因此这次武装叛乱很快就被平息了。
    新华社华沙1日电　波兰“华沙生活报”和“劳动之声报”今天就西藏最近发生的叛乱事件发表评论。
    “华沙生活报”指出，西藏过去和现在始终是中国的一部分。这家报纸写道，西藏的最近事件表明，封建势力和反动势力没有沉睡。但是它们遭到了失败。
    “劳动之声报”写道，西藏叛乱者和他们的魁首们的算盘打错了。
    由于得不到群众和西藏爱国人士的支持，叛乱被粉碎了。中国军队恢复了西藏秩序。帝国主义支持下的反动派想倒转历史车轮的企图又一次遭受了失败。
