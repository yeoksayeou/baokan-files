Xinhua News Agency, April 24th dispatch: Tokyo - The "Asahi Shimbun" Washington correspondent, Kawamura, pointed out in a recent report that the United States government has been "very concerned" about the armed rebellion of reactionary elements in Tibet from the very beginning, and is "deeply concerned" that the relationship between India and China will "change" due to the Tibetan issue.

Kawamura said, "From the repeated public statements made by the U.S. government and the reports in the newspapers, it can be seen that the United States was very concerned about the Tibetan rebellion from the start." Newspapers have devoted entire pages to reporting news about Tibet every day, and editorials have repeatedly commented on the issue.

At the same time, Kawamura also said, "Although the U.S. government authorities and newspapers are concerned about the Tibetan rebellion itself," they are "particularly concerned" about how the relationship between China and India and other neutral countries "will evolve." This reporter said that the United States had been dissatisfied with the attitude of countries like India toward China, believing that they "cannot recognize the aggressive nature of Communist China" and adopt a "weak attitude" towards China. "The reason why the U.S. government authorities are paying attention to what impact this Tibetan rebellion will have on the policies of India and other countries toward Communist China lies in this."

The reporter said that the United States has a "good impression" of the anti-China clamor issued by some Asian countries regarding the Chinese Tibetan rebellion.

Kawamura pointed out that the U.S. government "abhorred" China's suppression of the Tibetan armed rebellion and "expressed support" for the Tibetan rebels. However, Kawamura believes that "the U.S. government appears somewhat confused." On the one hand, it wants to slander China's dissolution of the Tibetan local government that launched the rebellion as a violation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, while on the other hand, it says that it has never recognized this agreement.

    日本“朝日新闻”驻华盛顿记者报道
    美国对反华叫嚷甚感满意
    密切注视着印度对我国态度的变化
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：“朝日新闻”驻华盛顿记者河村在不久前的一篇报道中指出，美国政府从一开始就“非常关心”西藏反动分子的武装叛乱，而且“深切关心”印度同中国之间的关系会因西藏问题而“发生变化”。
    河村说，“从美国政府屡次作的公开表示和报纸的报道情况可以看出，美国一开始就非常关心西藏叛乱”。报纸每天都以整版的篇幅大量地刊载有关西藏的消息，社论也一再评论这个问题。
    同时，河村又说，“美国政府当局和报纸虽然关心西藏叛乱本身”，但是，它们“表示特别关心”的事情却是：中国同印度以及其他中立国家的关系“将会怎样演变”。这个记者说，本来，美国在心里不满印度这样一些国家对中国的态度，认为它们“不能识别共产党中国的侵略性质”，对中国采取的是“软弱态度”。“美国政府当局之所以注意这次西藏叛乱将对印度等国的对共产党中国政策产生什么影响，原因就在于此。”
    记者说，美国这次对亚洲一些国家在中国西藏叛乱事件上发出的敌视中国的叫嚣有着“良好印象”。
    河村指出，美国政府对中国平定西藏武装叛乱是“深恶痛绝”的，并且对西藏叛乱分子“给予声援”。但是，河村认为“美国政府显得有些混乱”，它一方面要污蔑中国解散发动叛乱的西藏地方政府是违反和平解放西藏办法的协议，而另一方面却又说它从来没有承认过这个协议。
