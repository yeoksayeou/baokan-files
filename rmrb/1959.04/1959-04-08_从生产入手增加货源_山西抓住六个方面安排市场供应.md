Shanxi, April 7th (By Our Own Correspondent) The Shanxi Provincial Financial and Trade Work Conference, adhering to the principle of increasing the source of goods by starting with production, proposed to do a good job in this year's market supply from six aspects.

The six aspects are: actively organizing the production of daily-use industrial products; vigorously promoting the development of non-staple food production; strengthening the procurement and supply of agricultural products, and continuing to implement the state's unified purchase and sales policy; organizing the production and supply of means of production; strengthening foreign trade; and promoting the contract system between agricultural departments and commercial departments.

The conference proposed that in arranging daily-use industrial products, commercial departments should actively assist industry in building and expanding some light industry factories, give full play to the potential of handicraft production, and effectively help industrial departments solve difficulties in raw materials, equipment, etc., and assist in improving product quality and trial-producing new products.

For non-staple foods, it is necessary to adhere to the principles of unified leadership, regional balance, local production, and guaranteed supply, and strive to improve the supply situation in the shortest possible time. In pig production, actively promote collective breeding; in chicken production, implement the policy of attaching equal importance to collective breeding by communes and family breeding by members, and ensure the purchase of 700,000 fat pigs and 20 million catties of eggs throughout the year. In addition to continuing to consolidate and expand production bases in cities and industrial and mining areas, large-scale pig farms should be established in the three cities of Taiyuan, Datong, and Yangquan, and chicken farms should be established in the suburbs of the city, gradually achieving self-sufficiency in most of the pigs and all of the chickens. The commune canteens and organs, organizations, and schools below the county level should achieve self-sufficiency in the pork they need. Communes should incorporate vegetable production into the agricultural production plan, so that each team can grow vegetables, be self-sufficient and have a surplus to support other areas.

For the procurement and supply of agricultural products, it is necessary to resolutely implement the unified purchase and sales policy for grain, cotton, and oil, and correctly arrange for the needs of the state and the lives of the masses. We must also do a good job in the processing, transportation, and storage of grain, cotton, and oil.

The supply of means of production must be based on the principle of self-reliance as the main factor and purchasing from other places as a supplement. In addition to assisting industrial departments in arranging production, commercial departments should strive to purchase raw materials, find substitutes, and solve the difficulties of insufficient raw materials.

The production and supply of materials provided for national export should be included in the national economic plans of counties and cities, and be assigned to various factories, mines, and people's communes so that arrangements can be made as early as possible.

The contract system between agricultural departments and commercial departments is an effective measure for the state to implement planned leadership over people's communes and promote the rapid development of commodity production in people's communes, and should be vigorously promoted.

The conference proposed that the main tasks of the financial and trade departments in Shanxi Province this year are: to actively support the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and promote the completion of the national economic plan; according to the spirit of grasping both production and life, vigorously promote the development of daily-use industrial products and diversified economy, actively arrange the economic life of the masses, and ensure the normal supply of people's necessities; arrange the market by starting with arranging production; support the consolidation and development of rural people's communes in all aspects; further improve the financial and trade management system, establish necessary systems, rectify and manage the property of the financial and trade system, and ensure the timely supply of construction funds.

    从生产入手增加货源
    山西抓住六个方面安排市场供应
    本报太原7日电　山西省财贸工作会议本着从生产入手，增加货源的方针，提出从六个方面来做好今年的市场供应工作。
    这六个方面是：积极组织日用工业品的生产；大力促进副食品生产发展；加强农产品采购供应工作，继续贯彻执行国家的统购统销政策；组织生产资料的生产和供应；加强对外贸易；推行农业部门与商业部门之间的合同制度。
    会议提出在安排日用工业品方面，商业部门要积极协助工业新建与扩建一些轻工业工厂，充分发挥手工业生产的潜力，切实帮助工业部门解决原料、设备等方面的困难，协助提高产品质量和试制新产品。
    对于副食品，必须本着统一领导、分区平衡、就地生产、保证供应的原则，力争在最短时期内改善供应状况。猪的生产，积极地提倡集体饲养；鸡的生产，贯彻公社集体饲养和社员家庭饲养并重的方针，全年保证收购七十万头肥猪和二千万斤鸡蛋。城市和工矿区除继续巩固与扩大生产基地以外，要在太原、大同、阳泉三市大办养猪场，城市郊区要建立养鸡场，逐步做到猪的大部分和鸡的全部自给；公社食堂和县以下机关、团体、学校，所需要的猪肉要做到自给；公社要把蔬菜生产纳入农业生产计划之内，做到队队种菜，自给有余，支援外地。
    农产品的采购供应，要坚决贯彻粮食、棉花、油料的统购统销政策，正确地安排国家的需要和群众的生活。还要做好粮、棉、油的加工、调运、保管工作。
    生产资料的供应，必须贯彻以自力更生为主，以向外地采购为辅的方针。商业部门除了协助工业部门安排生产以外，要努力收购原料，寻找代用品，解决原料不足的困难。
    提供国家出口的物资的生产供应，要列入县、市国民经济计划，并且下达各厂矿和人民公社，以便早作安排。
    农业部门同商业部门之间的合同制度，是国家对人民公社实行计划领导，促进人民公社迅速发展商品生产的有效措施，应当大力推行。
    这次会议提出，今年山西省财贸部门的主要任务是：积极支援工农业生产大跃进，促进国民经济计划的完成；根据既要抓生产又要抓生活的精神，大力促进日用工业品和多种经济的发展，积极安排群众经济生活，保证人民生活必需品的正常供应；从安排生产入手安排市场；从各方面支援农村人民公社的巩固和发展；进一步改进财贸管理体制，建立必要的制度，把财贸系统的财产整顿好管理好，保证建设资金及时供应。
