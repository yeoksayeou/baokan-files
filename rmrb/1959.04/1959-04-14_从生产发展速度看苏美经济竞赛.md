　　Viewing the Soviet-American Economic Competition from the Perspective of Production Development Speed
　　Luo Fen
    The Soviet Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy, adopted by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is a magnificent program for transitioning to communism. The completion of this plan will allow the Soviet Union to take a decisive step in fulfilling its basic economic task, namely, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output in the shortest historical period. Therefore, the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan has brought the economic competition between the world socialist system and the capitalist system into a new and decisive stage.

    The speed of economic development plays a decisive role in the economic competition between the two systems. The practice of economic development in socialist countries has proven that the advantage in development speed belongs to the world socialist system. The world socialist system's high-speed economic development has already achieved significant victories in the economic competition with the capitalist system, and will soon achieve decisive victories.

    In the forty-one years since the Russian October Revolution, capitalist countries, especially the United States, have enjoyed more favorable objective conditions for developing their production than the Soviet Union. In 1913, Tsarist Russia's total industrial output ranked only fifth in the world, behind the United States, Britain, Germany, and France. At that time, Russia's industrial production level was less than one-fourteenth of that of the United States, one-fifth of that of Germany, and one-quarter of that of Britain. The First World War and the long period of civil war and foreign military intervention following the October Revolution severely damaged Russia's productive forces, causing devastating destruction to the already backward Russian economy. At the same time, the United States not only remained unaffected by the war, but on the contrary, took advantage of the war to amass wealth, enabling its economy to develop to a certain extent. Therefore, although the Soviet Union had healed its war wounds by 1929 and restored its national economy to pre-war levels, its industrial output at that time was even lower than that of the United States, with the United States exceeding it by seventeen times.

    In 1929, the Soviet Union began implementing its first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy. This plan was completed ahead of schedule in early 1933, taking only four years and three months. Subsequently, the Soviet Union immediately entered the period of implementing the second Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy. In the last year of the second Five-Year Plan, 1937, due to the high-speed economic development, the Soviet Union's industrial output experienced a tremendous increase, reaching one-fifth of the industrial output of the United States. This means that the Soviet Union only spent eight years to narrow the gap between the industrial output of the Soviet Union and the United States significantly.

    In 1941, the German fascist invasion of the Soviet Union interrupted the full implementation of the Soviet Union's third Five-Year Plan. Like the First World War, the Second World War brought different impacts to the economic development of the Soviet Union and the United States. During the four years of the war, the Soviet people endured tremendous sacrifices in manpower and material wealth to defend their motherland and liberate the people of Eastern European countries from fascist tyranny. The areas occupied by German fascists accounted for one-third of the Soviet Union's total industrial output before the war. The United States, far from the battlefield, increased its industrial production during the war by seizing the markets of belligerent and some neutral countries. Therefore, after the end of the Second World War, the gap in industrial output between the Soviet Union and the United States widened somewhat compared to the pre-war period.

    After the end of the Second World War, the Soviet people immediately began to heal the wounds of war and vigorously restore the national economy that had been destroyed by the war. In 1948, the Soviet Union's industrial production recovered to pre-war levels. The gap in industrial production between the Soviet Union and the United States then narrowed sharply. In 1953, the Soviet Union's industrial output reached one-third of that of the United States. By 1957, the Soviet Union's industrial output was more than one-half of that of the United States. At this time, in Europe, the Soviet Union's total industrial output not only caught up with but also greatly exceeded that of the most developed capitalist countries. The Soviet Union's industrial output in 1957 was approximately 2.5 times that of West Germany, four times that of Britain, and 6.6 times that of France. In 1958, due to the continued growth of Soviet industrial production and the decline of American industrial production, the ratio of industrial production between the Soviet Union and the United States narrowed even further.

    This is the situation of the peaceful economic competition between socialist Soviet Union and the most developed capitalist country, the United States, over the past forty years. This situation shows that despite the United States having more favorable conditions for developing its economy, despite the United States having taken advantage of the war to amass wealth, and despite the Soviet Union having had to spend almost twenty years (1917 to 1928 and 1941 to 1948) engaged in war and healing the wounds that war brought to the national economy, and only twenty years to carry out peaceful economic construction, the Soviet Union has achieved such great accomplishments in economic development!

    The reason why the Soviet Union was able to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in Europe and reach more than half of the total industrial output of the world's most developed capitalist country – the United States – in the short span of forty years, and during which it also suffered serious damage from two wars, is because the Soviet Union has an economic development speed in developing its economy that no capitalist country could ever imagine. From 1918 to 1957, including the war years, the average annual growth rate of Soviet industry was 10.1%, while that of the United States was only 3.2%, Britain was 1.9%, and France was 3%. If we do not count the war years and the period of economic recovery, the average annual growth rate of Soviet industry was 16.2%, while that of the United States was only 2.9%, Britain was 3.3%, and France was 2.6%.

    The Soviet Union's recent economic task is not only to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist country—the United States—in terms of total industrial and agricultural output, but also to catch up with and surpass it in terms of per capita output. Currently, the Soviet Union's total industrial output is about half of that of the United States, and its per capita output is more than half that of the United States. The Soviet Union's total agricultural output is 20% to 25% lower than that of the United States, and its per capita output is more than 40% lower. The task of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is to increase industrial output by 80% and agricultural output by 70%. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that when the Soviet Union completes its plan, the absolute output of some of its most important industrial products will exceed the current industrial production level of the United States, while the output of other products will approach the current level of the United States. By that time, the total output and per capita output of the Soviet Union's most important agricultural products will exceed the current level of the United States.

    Some people once believed that speed does not explain everything, and that due to the differences in the absolute output of industry and agriculture between the Soviet Union and the United States, although the Soviet Union's production speed exceeds that of the United States, the difference in absolute output will continue to widen. There was indeed such a period in the production development of the Soviet Union and the United States, but as Comrade Khrushchev said: that era has passed. In the past eight years, the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in the absolute increase in output of a series of the most important products (steel, pig iron, iron ore, coal, cement, woolen fabrics). In the next seven years, even if the average annual growth rate of industry and agriculture in the United States can reach 2%, rather than stagnating as it did in 1957 and even decreasing as it did in 1958, it is not difficult to see that the Soviet Union, with more than half of the United States' industrial output and more than three-quarters of its agricultural output, is developing at a rate more than four times higher than that of the United States, and will obviously soon catch up with the United States in production and leave it behind.

    After the completion of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, the balance of power between the world socialist system and the world capitalist system will undergo tremendous changes. Currently, the world socialist system occupies a quarter of the world's land, a third of its population, more than a third of its industrial output, and almost half of its grain output. Seven years later, due to the completion and over-fulfillment of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy, and due to the high-speed economic development of our country and all other socialist countries, economists estimate that the total industrial output of the countries in the world socialist system will account for more than half of the world's total industrial output. By then, as Comrade Khrushchev said in his report to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, socialism will attract millions of new believers, strengthen the world's peace forces, weaken the forces of war, and cause tremendous changes throughout the world. At that time, life will be even more difficult for the world capitalist system.

　　从生产发展速度看苏美经济竞赛
　　罗焚
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所通过的苏联发展国民经济七年计划，是一个向共产主义过渡的宏伟纲领。这个计划的完成，将使苏联在实现基本经济任务方面，即在最短的历史时期内，在按人口平均计算的产品产量上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家方面，迈出决定性的一步。因此，七年计划的实施，已使世界社会主义体系和资本主义体系之间的经济竞赛，进入了新的、决定性的阶段。
    经济发展的速度，在两个体系的经济竞赛中，起着决定性的作用。社会主义国家经济发展的实践证明，发展速度方面的优势，是属于世界社会主义体系的。世界社会主义体系的高速度的经济发展，已经在同资本主义体系的经济竞赛中，取得了重大的胜利，而且不久还将取得决定性的胜利。
    俄国十月革命后的四十一年间，资本主义国家，特别是美国，在发展自己的生产上，曾经得到了比苏联远为顺利的客观条件。1913年，沙皇俄国的工业生产总额，只占世界第五位，次于美国、英国、德国和法国。当时俄国的工业生产水平还占不到美国的十四分之一、德国的五分之一和英国的四分之一。第一次世界大战和十月革命后的长期的国内战争和外国军事干涉，严重地毁坏了当时俄国的生产力，使本来就落后的俄国经济遭到了毁灭性的破坏。但同时，美国却不仅没有受到战争的影响，而且相反，美国却利用了这次战争大发横财，使自己的经济得到了一定发展。因此，到1929年，苏联虽然已经医好了自己的战争创伤，使国民经济恢复到了战前的水平，但当时苏联的工业生产量却比美国低的更多，美国高出它十七倍。
    1929年，苏联开始实现发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。这个计划在1933年初提前完成，仅仅用了四年零三个月的时间。随后，苏联紧接着便进入实现发展国民经济的第二个五年计划时期，在第二个五年计划的最后一年，即1937年，由于经济的高速度发展，苏联的工业生产量有了巨大的增长，已达美国工业生产量的五分之一。这就是说，苏联仅仅花了八年时间，就把苏美两国工业生产量之间的差距缩短了很多。
    1941年，德国法西斯对苏联的进攻中断了苏联发展国民经济第三个五年计划的完全实现。同第一次世界大战一样，第二次世界大战也给苏美两国的经济发展带来了不同的影响。在四年的战争中，苏联人民为保卫祖国和从法西斯暴政下解放东欧各国人民，在人力和物质财富上经受了巨大的牺牲。被德国法西斯占领的地区，战前提供的工业生产量，占苏联全部工业生产量的三分之一。而远离战场的美国，由于夺取了交战国和一些中立国家的市场，在战争中的工业生产却增加了。因此，第二次世界大战结束之后，苏美两国在工业生产量上的差距较战前有所增大。
    第二次世界大战结束之后，苏联人民立即开始医治战争的创伤，大力恢复被战争破坏了的国民经济。1948年，苏联的工业生产恢复到了战前水平。苏美两国在工业生产上的差距接着便急剧缩小。1953年，苏联的工业生产量已达美国工业生产量的三分之一。到1957年，苏联的工业生产量已为美国工业生产量的二分之一以上。这时，在欧洲，苏联的工业生产总量不仅赶上而且大大超过了最发达的资本主义国家。苏联1957年的工业生产量已经大约为西德工业生产量的二点五倍，英国的四倍，法国的六点六倍。1958年，由于苏联工业生产的继续增长，美国工业生产的下降，苏美两国的工业生产比例更加缩小了。
    这就是四十年来，社会主义的苏联同最发达的资本主义国家美国的和平经济竞赛的情况。这一情况说明，尽管美国有着发展经济的更为顺利的条件，尽管美国曾利用战争大发横财，也尽管苏联曾经不得不用几乎是二十年（1917年至1928年和1941年至1948年）的时间来从事战争和医治战争给国民经济带来的创伤，而只不过以二十年的时间来进行和平的经济建设，但苏联却在经济发展上取得了多么大的成就！
    苏联之所以能在短短的四十年的时间内，而且其间还遭受两次战争的严重破坏，在经济上赶上和超过欧洲最发达的资本主义国家，达到世界上资本主义最发达的国家——美国工业生产总量的一半以上，是因为苏联在发展自己的经济上具有任何资本主义国家所不能设想的经济发展速度。从1918年到1957年，包括战争的年份在内，苏联工业增长的速度，平均每年为10.1％，而美国不过为3.2％，英国为1.9％，法国为3％。如果不算战争年份和恢复经济时期，苏联工业平均每年增长的速度则为16.2％，美国仅为2.9％，英国为3.3％，法国为2.6％。
    苏联最近时期的经济任务是：不仅要在工农业的总产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家——美国，而且要在按人口平均计算的产量方面也赶上和超过它。目前，苏联工业总产量约比美国工业总产量低一半，按人口平均计算则比美国低一半以上。苏联农业总产量比美国低20％到25％，按人口平均计算低40％多。苏联七年计划的任务是在工业产量方面提高80％，农业产量方面提高70％。因此，不难看出，苏联在完成计划时，它的工业的某些最主要的产品的绝对产量将超过美国现在的工业生产水平，而其他某些产品的产量将接近于美国现在的水平。到那时候，苏联最重要的农产品的总量和按人口平均计算的产量，都将超过美国现在的水平。
    曾经有人认为，速度并不能说明一切问题，由于苏美两国在工农业绝对产量方面的不同，虽然苏联的生产速度超过了美国，但绝对产量之间的差数仍将扩大。在苏美两国的生产发展上，的确存在过这样一个时期，但正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说：这种时代已经过去了。最近八年来，苏联在一系列最重要产品（钢、生铁、铁矿砂、煤、水泥、毛织品）的绝对增产量方面，已超过了美国的指标。今后七年，即令美国工农业每年平均增长速度能达到2％，而不是像1957年那样发生停滞和1958年那样甚至减产，那也不难看出：有着等于美国工业产量一半以上和农业产量四分之三以上的苏联，却以高于美国四倍以上的速度发展，显然很快即将在生产上赶上美国并把它抛在后面。
    苏联七年计划完成后，世界社会主义体系和世界资本主义体系之间的力量对比，将发生巨大的变化。目前，世界社会主义体系占有世界四分之一的土地，三分之一的人口，三分之一以上的工业产量，几乎一半的粮食产量。七年以后，由于苏联发展国民经济七年计划的完成和超额完成，由于我国和所有其他社会主义国家经济的高速度发展，据经济学家计算，世界社会主义体系各国的工业总产量将占世界工业总产量的一半以上，到那时，正如赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上的报告中所说，社会主义将吸引来千百万新的信仰者，将加强世界的和平力量，削弱战争力量，将在全世界引起巨大的变化。那时候，对世界资本主义体系来说，日子就将更加不好过了。
