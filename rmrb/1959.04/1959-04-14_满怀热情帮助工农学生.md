　　Helping Worker-Peasant Students with Enthusiasm

Recently, many institutions of higher learning, while strengthening their teaching work, have paid special attention to caring for the studies of worker-peasant students and have taken various measures to strengthen their tutoring. This is very necessary. To build socialism, it is necessary to expand the ranks of worker-class intellectuals, and the active care and cultivation of educators play an important role in the growth of this force. Worker-peasant students at Sun Yat-sen University, under the care of the school's Party organization and the enthusiastic and patient guidance of teachers, have rapidly improved their learning quality.

Over the past year, higher education institutions have made great achievements in implementing the class line and the educational policy of opening the door to workers and peasants. The proportion of worker-peasant students is constantly rising, and the erroneous ideas of underestimating worker-peasant students and the bourgeois idea of genius education have been severely criticized. A contingent of worker-peasant intellectuals needed to build socialism is growing stronger.

How to better cultivate worker-peasant students still requires further establishing the idea and atmosphere of loving worker-peasant students in schools, and taking active and effective measures in teaching. It is unimaginable to cultivate and teach worker-peasant students well without establishing the ideological sentiment of loving them; without specific measures and methods to help worker-peasant students learn, it is also impossible to effectively cultivate and teach them well.

Worker-peasant students have many advantages in learning: high class consciousness, great revolutionary drive, high enthusiasm for learning, clear goals, willingness to study hard, and most have relatively rich practical experience, strong understanding of things, and good academic performance. However, due to their poor foundation in the past, they still have many difficulties in learning. Therefore, it is an important issue in teaching work for school leaders and teachers to carry forward the advantages possessed by worker-peasant students and constantly help them overcome difficulties in learning.

Currently, after criticizing the idea of underestimating worker-peasant students, most teachers have correctly recognized the importance of cultivating them. They realize that the teaching attitude towards worker-peasant students is the best measure of their own class consciousness and class stand. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party committee, many teachers have begun to establish the ideological sentiment of loving worker-peasant students. They are now not only able to care about the learning of worker-peasant students, but also actively think of some ways to help them overcome various difficulties in learning. For example, some teachers often go deep to understand the problems in the learning of worker-peasant students, prepare lessons meticulously before lecturing, provide individual tutoring outside of class, and pay attention to inspiring worker-peasant students to think independently, guiding them to proceed step by step, master learning laws, and use good learning methods. Some teachers also kindly introduce their accumulated learning methods and experiences to worker-peasant students, encourage their learning confidence, and encourage them to study hard and move forward continuously. Such teachers have been warmly welcomed and loved by worker-peasant students.

However, there are also a few teachers who, although they have begun to recognize the importance of cultivating worker-peasant students, have not yet truly achieved enthusiastic treatment of their studies in terms of ideological sentiment, so they still need to further improve their sense of teaching responsibility and show full enthusiasm to care for the learning of worker-peasant students.

At present, helping worker-peasant students to study well and further enabling each of them to obtain excellent academic results has become one of the important tasks of leaders and teachers in many institutions of higher learning. The Party organizations of many schools have assigned teachers with rich teaching experience and progressive political ideology to be responsible for the teaching and tutoring of worker-peasant students. This has made a good start for valuing, caring for and cultivating worker-peasant students, and loving them.

　　满怀热情帮助工农学生
    最近，许多高等学校在加强教学工作的同时，特别注意了关怀工农学生的学习，采取各种措施，加强对工农学生的辅导工作。这样做是十分必要的。建设社会主义，必须扩大工人阶级的知识分子队伍，而这支队伍的成长，教育工作者的积极关怀和培养，是起着重要作用的。中山大学的工农学生，就是在学校党组织的关怀和教师的热情耐心教导下，迅速提高了学习质量的。
    一年来，高等学校在贯彻阶级路线，贯彻向工农开门的教育方针上，取得了很大的成绩。工农学生的比例不断在上升，轻视工农学生的错误思想，资产阶级的天才教育思想已经受到了严肃的批判。一支建设社会主义所需要的工农知识分子队伍正在壮大成长。
    如何更好地培养工农学生，还需要在学校中进一步树立热爱工农学生的思想和风气，并在教学上采取积极有力的措施。如果没有树立起热爱工农学生的思想感情，而能够培养和教好工农学生，是不可想像的；如果没有具体地帮助工农学生学习的措施和办法，也是不能有效地培养和教好工农学生的。
    工农学生在学习上具备着许多优点：阶级觉悟高，革命干劲大，学习热情高，目标很明确，肯刻苦钻研，而且大多具有比较丰富的实际经验，对事物的理解能力强，学习成绩是较好的。但是，他们由于过去的基础较差，学习上还是有许多困难的。因此，学校领导上和教师们要发扬工农学生所具备的优点，不断帮助他们克服学习中的困难，是教学工作中重要的问题。
    目前在批判了轻视工农学生的思想以后，大多数教师都正确地认识了培养工农学生的重要意义。他们认识到对待工农学生的教学态度，也就是最好地衡量自己的阶级觉悟、阶级立场的一个标准。因此，不少教师在党委的领导下，开始树立了热爱工农学生的思想感情。他们现在不仅能够关心工农学生的学习，而且主动想了一些办法，积极帮助工农学生克服学习中的各种困难。例如，有的教师经常深入了解工农学生学习上存在的问题，在讲课前细致地备课，在课外进行个别辅导，并注意启发工农学生独立思考，引导他们循序渐进，掌握学习规律，运用良好的学习方法。有的教师还亲切地把自己过去积累的学习方法和经验，认真介绍给工农学生，鼓舞他们的学习信心，勉励他们努力学习，不断前进。这样的教师，受到了工农学生的热烈欢迎和爱戴。
    但是，也还有少数教师，虽然开始认识到培养工农学生的重要，但还没有从思想感情上真正做到热情对待工农学生的学习，所以还需要他进一步努力提高自己的教学责任感，拿出满怀热情，关心工农学生的学习。
    目前，帮助工农学生学好功课，进一步使他们个个获得优良的学习成绩，已经成为许多高等学校领导上和教师们重要工作之一。许多学校的党组织把教学经验丰富、政治思想进步的教师分配来负责担任工农学生的教学和辅导工作。这就为重视、关怀培养工农学生，和热爱工农学生作了良好的开端。
