Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 4th: The early rice transplanting work on Hainan Island has been basically completed. Most areas have invested their main force in the field management of early rice and have begun the battle to eliminate third-class seedlings. At the same time, the sowing and seedling cultivation of mid-season rice has also begun.

　　By the end of March, Hainan Island had transplanted more than 1.48 million mu of early rice, accounting for more than 90% of this year’s early rice planting plan. The early rice transplanted in various places is generally densely planted with 400,000 to 500,000 seedlings per mu. Wanning, Lehui, Qiongdong, Yaxian, and Chengmai, where transplanting began earlier, are currently focusing on field management. Wanning, Lehui, Qiongdong and other counties have launched a vigorous upsurge to eliminate third-class seedlings. Nearly half of the field management team of more than 100,000 people are camping in the fields; commune members are rushing to burn plant ash and produce indigenous fertilizers overnight, and applying top dressing twice to more than 60,000 mu of third-class seedlings in the county, applying 150 to 200 dan of fertilizer per mu; nearly 40,000 dan of indigenous pesticides have been manufactured and applied to fields where diseases and insect pests have occurred.

　　Hainan Island also plans to plant more than 1 million mu of sweet potatoes and mid-season rice this year. In Yaxian, where the season is earlier, the sowing and seedling cultivation of mid-season rice has already begun.
