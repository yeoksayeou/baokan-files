    Free Air Travel

    On April 5th, a beautiful British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) jet landed at San Francisco Airport in the United States. Fourteen passengers disembarked from the plane. They boarded this BOAC global route aircraft in Hong Kong and Tokyo, respectively. The passengers greeted people cheerfully. One passenger said, "I am an experienced air traveler, but this is the first time I have flown for free. This free trip saved me two hundred pounds." However, the BOAC personnel present frowned and remained silent, as if they had some unspeakable suffering.

    Free long-distance travel is rare on international air routes. It is even more perplexing that BOAC is offering free travel, given that it suffered a huge loss of 4.75 million pounds in the fiscal year ending March 31st.

    In the past month or two, BOAC has been advertising extensively, claiming that it was the first company to open a global jet route, and announced that the final link of the global jet route would be completed after the opening of its new Hong Kong-Tokyo-Honolulu-San Francisco Pacific route on April 5th. BOAC was confident in opening the new Pacific route because, according to the 1946 Anglo-American Aviation Agreement, BOAC had the right to operate aviation services in the Pacific. As early as October 23, 1958, it applied to the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) for a permit for its aircraft to fly through the Pacific route from Tokyo to San Francisco.

    As the opening date approached, the U.S. CAB delayed issuing the permit. It turned out that Northwest Airlines had put pressure on the U.S. CAB. Northwest Airlines was worried about competition from BOAC and complained that Britain had not given Northwest Airlines the right to fly from Tokyo to Hong Kong. The company publicly stated that if Britain promptly agreed that Northwest Airlines aircraft had the right to land in Hong Kong, Northwest Airlines would immediately withdraw its opposition from the U.S. CAB.

    The tactics of Northwest Airlines and the delay by the U.S. CAB aroused widespread indignation in Britain. The "Times" and the "Financial Times" both reported the news of the sabotage of BOAC's global travel plan by Northwest Airlines in the most prominent positions and in a condemnatory tone. The British Foreign Office instructed the British Ambassador to the United States to lodge a protest with the State Department and summoned the U.S. Ambassador to Britain to express the British government's concern about the U.S. CAB's delay in issuing BOAC's Pacific route permit. The British Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation also issued a strong statement, vehemently condemning Northwest Airlines for using the CAB's procedures to exert pressure on Britain, so that Britain was "either forced to concede valuable navigation rights (to American companies) or to give up exercising the rights that the U.S. government has already promised to grant."

    BOAC's experience also caused a stir in the British Parliament. Labour MP Brown said angrily: "This incident once again proves the aggressive and brutal policies of the American trade and business circles towards Britain... British patience is limited."

    The opening day of BOAC's Pacific route arrived. Passengers had already booked their seats. However, the permit had still not been issued. Without a permit, tickets for this route could not be sold, but BOAC was unwilling to succumb and stubbornly endured the pain to hold a free air travel event.

    According to a report in the "Times" on April 11, the U.S. CAB had still not made a final decision on BOAC's application, but BOAC was no longer able to continue to offer free air travel and had decided to temporarily suspend the flight of this new jet route. (Leshan)

    免费的空中旅行
    4月5日，英国海外航空公司的一架漂亮的喷气式客机，在美国旧金山的机场降落了。从飞机上走下来了十四名乘客。他们是分别在香港、东京搭乘英国海外航空公司环球航空线的这架客机的。乘客们兴高采烈地向人们打招呼。有一个乘客说：“我是空中旅行的老手，可是免费坐飞机，这还是第一次。这次免费旅行使我节省了两百英镑。”可是在场的英国海外航空公司的人员却愁眉苦脸地一言不发，仿佛有什么难言的苦衷。
    在国际航空线上，免费的长途旅行是罕有的事情。而英国海外航空公司举办免费旅行更属令人不解，因为在以3月31日为截止日期的会计年度中，英国海外航空公司亏损达四百七十五万英镑之巨。
    最近一两个月以来，英国海外航空公司在各地大登广告，宣传英国海外航空公司是第一个开辟喷气式客机环球航线的公司，并宣布4月5日该公司新辟的香港—东京—檀香山—旧金山太平洋航线开航以后，喷气式飞机环球航线最后的一环便完成了。英国海外航空公司开辟太平洋新航线是胸有成竹的，因为根据1946年英美航空协定，英国海外航空公司有权经营太平洋的航空事业，而且早于1958年10月23日，就向美国民用航空局申请发给该公司飞机通过从东京到旧金山这一段太平洋航线航行的许可证。
    开航的日期近了。美国民用航空局一直拖延不发许可证。原来，美国的西北航空公司向美国民用航空局施加了压力。美国西北航空公司担心英国海外航空公司的竞争，又抱怨英国没有给美国西北航空公司从东京飞到香港的权利。这个公司公开地说，如果英国及时同意美国西北航空公司的飞机有权在香港降落，那么美国西北航空公司就立刻从美国民用航空局撤回它的反对。
    美国西北航空公司的手法、美国民用航空局的拖延，在英国激起了普遍的愤慨。英国“泰晤士报”、“金融时报”都以最显著的地位，用谴责的口吻报道英国海外航空公司环球航行计划遭受美国西北航空公司破坏的消息。英国外交部一面训令英国驻美大使向国务院提出抗议，一面召见美国驻英大使，说明英国政府对美国民用航空局拖延颁发英国海外航空公司太平洋新航线许可证一事，表示关切。英国运输与民用航空部又发表了一个强硬的声明，猛烈谴责美国西北航空公司利用民用航空局的程序来对英国施加压力，使英国“不是被迫让予（美国公司）以有价值的航行权，就是放弃行使美国政府已经答应给予的权利。”
    英国海外航空公司的遭遇，在英国议会里也激起了一阵风波。工党议员布朗愤激地说：“这个事件又一次证明了美国的贸易界、商界以英国为对象的侵略、粗暴的政策……英国的忍耐是有限的。”
    英国海外航空公司的太平洋航线开航的日子到了。旅客们早已预定了舱位。可是许可证仍旧没有发下来。没有许可证就不能发售这条航线的客票，但是，英国海外航空公司不甘屈服，硬着头皮忍痛举办一次免费的空中旅行。
    据“泰晤士报”4月11日的消息，美国民用航空局对英国海外航空公司的申请，仍旧没有作最后的决定，可是英国海外航空公司已无力继续举办免费的空中旅行，已经决定暂时停止这条喷气式客机新航线的飞行了。　（乐山）
