Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: In order to guarantee the smelting of good iron and good steel and to smoothly complete this year's steel production tasks, China is accelerating the construction of eight modern coal washeries. The civil engineering of five plants, including Matou (Hebei), Handan, Taiyuan, Zhuzhou, and Xing'an Taiwan (Heilongjiang), has been basically completed, and the electromechanical installation engineering has also been completed by about 50% to 70%. It is expected to be put into production within June; the three plants in Zhongliangshan (Sichuan), Yongrong (Sichuan), and Baotou are also under tense construction.

These coal washeries are all key projects above the quota limit. After they are all completed, they can wash 12.95 million tons of raw coal annually. Among them, the five plants planned to be put into production in June can wash 8.8 million tons of raw coal annually and are expected to wash 1.95 million tons of raw coal this year. Because these coal washeries are highly mechanized, the quality of the washed refined coal is excellent, the ash content can be below 10% to 11%, the moisture content can be below 8% to 12%, and the recovery rate is generally 55% to 70%. The large amount of refined coal washed by these coal washeries is mainly supplied to key steel enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Baotou Iron and Steel Company, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company.

The workers who are building these coal washeries have launched a red flag competition movement centered on technological revolution in order to strive for the early completion of the project and put it into production. In the competition, the attendance rate of many groups reached 100%. The battle slogans put forward by the workers are: work hard, work practically and work skillfully, ensure quality and safety, strive to deliver production ahead of schedule, and our hearts will not be satisfied without inserting the red flag.

The relevant central departments attach great importance to the construction of these coal washeries. The Ministry of Coal Industry has allocated ten locomotives, two hundred and fifty bottom-discharge vehicles, and a large number of heavy rails to the five plants planned to be put into production in June, and is responsible for supplying materials such as steel, cement, and wood. The First Ministry of Machine Building will also prioritize solving the more than 1,000 tons of main equipment required by these five plants. In late March, the State Basic Construction Commission, together with the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, machinery, commerce and other relevant departments, also held a meeting to specifically study effective measures to speed up the construction of these five plants.

　　快给钢铁企业更多的精煤
　　八个现代化洗煤厂加速兴建
    据新华社11日讯　为了保证炼出好铁好钢，顺利地完成今年钢铁生产任务，我国正在加速建设八个现代化的洗煤厂。其中马头（河北）、邯郸、太原、株洲、兴安台（黑龙江）等五个厂的土建工程已基本完成，机电安装工程也已完成50％至70％左右，预计在6月份内即可投入生产；中梁山（四川）、永荣（四川）、包头等三个厂也正在紧张施工中。
    这批洗煤厂都是限额以上的重点工程，它们全部建成后，每年可以入洗原煤一千二百九十五万吨，其中计划在6月份投入生产的五个厂，每年可以入洗原煤八百八十万吨，今年内要入洗一百九十五万吨原煤。由于这批洗煤厂的机械化程度高，洗出的精煤质量优良，灰分可在10％至11％以下，水分在8％至12％以下，回收率一般为55％至70％。这批洗煤厂洗出的大量精煤主要是供应武汉钢铁公司、包头钢铁公司、太原钢铁公司等重点钢铁企业。
    建设这批洗煤厂的职工，为了争取工程提早完成并投入生产，纷纷掀起以技术革命为中心的红旗竞赛运动。在竞赛中，许多小组出勤率达到了100％。职工们提出的战斗口号是：苦干实干加巧干，确保质量和安全，力争提前交生产，不插红旗心不甘。
    中央有关部门对这批洗煤厂的建设都非常重视。煤炭部已经把十台机车、二百五十台底开车和大批重轨，拨给计划在6月份投入生产的五个厂，并且负责供应钢材、水泥、木料等材料。第一机械工业部也要优先解决这五个厂所需的一千多吨主要设备。3月下旬，国家基本建设委员会，还和国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会、机械、商业等有关部门开会，具体研究了加快建设这五个厂的有效措施。
