Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 28th: Some expansionist elements in India are increasingly revealing their ambitions and true colors. The General Secretary of the Indian People's Alliance, Upadhyaya, clamored on the 27th that the Indian People's Alliance intends to send a "volunteer army" to Tibet to participate in some kind of "fight for freedom against the Chinese."

The "Hindustan Times" published on the 28th the remarks of this Indian political party leader in Agra, advocating for Tibet's "independence" in order to serve as a so-called "guarantee of lasting peace in Asia."

He also said that India's approach of only allowing the Dalai Lama "asylum" "cannot help Tibet, nor can it satisfy the feelings of the people."

According to the "Times of India" Benares, the agenda committee of the Indian Socialist Party's national conference passed a resolution on the 25th, viciously defaming China. It nonsensically claimed that "to exterminate the Tibetan nation is to fundamentally strike at Sino-Indian friendship."

The resolution stated that "the entire theory about China having suzerainty over Tibet is a hateful imperialist doctrine."

The resolution complained that the Indian government handed over to China the rights it had obtained from its predecessor, the British government. It said that Tibet should have been allowed to become "independent" like Nepal. It also absurdly proposed that India, China, and Tibet conclude a treaty not to use any party's "territory" against another party.

The resolution favored granting "full facilities" to Tibetan rebels seeking refuge in India.

    印度人民同盟总书记竟用“热战的语言”
    公然叫嚣要派“志愿军”去西藏
    新华社新德里28日电　印度的一些扩张主义分子越来越暴露出他们的野心和真面目。印度人民同盟总书记乌帕德亚亚在27日公然叫嚣说，印度人民同盟打算派“志愿军”到西藏参加什么“反对中国人的争取自由的战斗”。
    “印度斯坦时报”28日登载的这个印度政党领袖在亚格拉发表的谈话，鼓吹让西藏“独立”，以便作为所谓“亚洲的持久和平的保证”。
    他还说，印度只让达赖喇嘛“避难”的这种作法“既不能帮助西藏，也不能满足人民的感情。”
    据“印度时报”贝拿勒斯消息，印度社会党全国会议议题委员会在25日通过了一次决议，恶毒地诽谤中国。它胡说什么“要绝灭西藏民族，那就是要从根本上打击印中友谊。”
    决议说，“关于中国对西藏拥有宗主权的整个理论是一种可憎的帝国主义学说。”
    决议抱怨印度政府把它从它的前任英国政府那里得到的权利交给中国。它说，本来应当像让尼泊尔独立那样让西藏“独立”。它还极为荒谬地主张由印度、中国和西藏缔结不利用任何一方的“领土”来反对另一方的条约。
    决议赞成给西藏叛乱分子在印度避难的“充分的便利”。
