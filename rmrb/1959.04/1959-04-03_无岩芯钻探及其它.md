Industrial Common Sense

    I. Coreless drilling is a drilling method where only the hole is created, and no rock core is extracted. Core extraction involves bringing underground rock samples to the surface, requiring the drilling to stop and the drilling tool to be raised each time a certain depth is reached. Drilling hundreds of meters deep would require repeatedly raising the drilling tool, costing a lot of time. Coreless drilling eliminates the need for repeatedly raising the drilling tool, thus making it more efficient than core extraction drilling.

    II. Coreless Drilling Electric Logging Interpretation Method: Well logging is one of the exploration methods. Depending on the instruments and methods used, it is divided into electric logging, magnetic logging, gas logging, etc. Currently, electric logging is widely used in coalfields. Its working principle is: different resistivities, artificial induced potentials, and natural potentials will produce curves of different amplitudes, and the location and thickness of the coal seam are analyzed based on the curves. When electric logging was first utilized, it was only used as an auxiliary means of exploration to locate coal seams that were missed or thinned out during drilling. After the development of coreless drilling, the interpretation mainly relied on electric logging data. This is called the coreless drilling electric logging interpretation method. Its advantages are high efficiency and low cost. However, when the electrical properties of the rock in a certain area are poor, or when high-resistivity limestone or sandstone interlocks with coal seams, it is difficult to determine whether there is coal. This defect has been solved by a new logging method—radioactive logging.

    III. Radioactive Logging: Radioactive logging is divided into two types: natural radioactive logging and artificial radioactive logging.

    Natural radioactive logging can be used to find uranium deposits and to cooperate with coreless drilling to create borehole columnar diagrams. Artificial radioactive logging, also known as density logging, is the peaceful use of atomic energy in geological exploration. It uses the artificial radioactive isotope Cobalt-60 as a radioactive source. Cobalt-60 can emit gamma rays that have even more energy than X-rays. After these rays enter the rock formation, they are absorbed. The degree of absorption of the rays differs depending on the density of the rock, and the amount of scattered rays that return also differs, which is reflected in different curves. There is a large difference in density between coal and other surrounding rocks, and the reflected curves have obvious differences. Therefore, this type of radioactive logging can accurately determine the location and thickness of coal.

    无岩芯钻探及其它
    一、无岩芯钻探是在钻探时光打眼，不取岩芯。取岩芯是把地下深部的石头取上来，这样每钻进一定深度就要停钻提钻具一次；打几百公尺深的钻孔，需要反复提多次钻具。这要费很多时间。无岩芯钻探就不必反复提钻具了，因此它比取岩芯钻探的效率高。
    二、无岩芯钻探电测解释法：测井是勘探的手段之一。根据利用的仪器和方法的不同，分为电测井、磁测井、气测井，等等。目前在煤田中广泛应用的是电测井。它的工作原理是：不同的电阻牵、人工次生电位、自然电位，会反应出不同幅度的曲线，根据曲线来分析出煤层位置和煤层厚度。电测井开始被利用时，只作为勘探的辅助手段，用来找钻探打丢和打薄的煤。开展无岩芯钻探以后，便主要依靠电测井资料进行解释。这叫做无岩芯钻探电测解释法。它的优点是效率高，成本低。但是，在一个地方岩石的电性不好或高电阻的石灰岩、岩砂与煤层交互存在时，就难确定是否有煤了。这个缺陷又被新的测井方法——放射性测井解决了。
    三、放射性测井：放射性测井又分天然放射性测井和人工放射性测井两种。
    天然放射性测井可以用来找铀矿和配合无岩芯钻探作钻孔柱状图。人工放射性测井又称密度测井，是原子能在地质勘探中的和平利用。它是利用人工放射性同位素钴60作放射源。钴60能放出一种比X光能量还强的伽玛射线。这种射线打入岩层后就会被吸收。岩石的密度不同，对射线吸收的程度就不同，散射回来的射线多少也就不同，随之反应出不同的曲线。煤和其他围岩之间在密度上有很大差异，反应的曲线就有明显区别，因此，这种放射性测井可以准确地探明煤的位置和厚度。
