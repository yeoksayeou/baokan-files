    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 1st: According to a report by the Polish News Agency, the Polish government fully supports the Soviet government's proposal regarding the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The Polish government also supports the Soviet government's proposals on concluding a peace treaty with Germany, resolving the West Berlin issue, and other proposals aimed at eliminating the threat of war.
    The Polish Foreign Ministry Spokesman made the above remarks to reporters from the Polish News Agency regarding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting and the Soviet government's statement on March 29th. He also said that the Polish Foreign Ministry fully agrees with the Soviet government's assessment in the statement regarding the activities of the North Atlantic Group and its role in the development of international relations.
    He said that the North Atlantic Treaty, from the very beginning, has been the main tool for opposing socialist countries and conducting the Cold War. He pointed out that, in order to defend their own security and peace in Europe, socialist countries signed the Warsaw Treaty.
    Out of a desire to ease tensions in the center of Europe, the Polish government has put forward the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The Polish government supports this proposal, which was reiterated in the Soviet government's statement, and it believes that the realization of this proposal would make an important contribution to strengthening European security and the cause of peace. He said that now there are conditions to consolidate peace through consultation and in the spirit of co-existence and cooperation among nations through resolving disputes. We hope that the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the planned summit of major powers will help achieve this goal.

    波兰外交部发言人发表谈话
    支持苏联提出的和平建议
    指责北大西洋集团反对社会主义国家和进行冷战
    新华社华沙1日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰政府完全支持苏联政府提出的关于北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织之间缔结互不侵犯条约的建议。波兰政府也支持苏联政府提出的关于缔结对德和约的建议、关于解决西柏林问题的建议以及其他旨在消除战争威胁的建议。
    波兰外交部发言人就北大西洋公约组织理事会会议和苏联政府3月29日的声明，向波兰通讯社记者发表了上述谈话。他还说，波兰外交部完全同意苏联政府在声明中对北大西洋集团的活动和在国际关系发展中的作用所作的评价。
    他说，北大西洋公约从一开始就是反对社会主义国家和进行冷战的主要工具。他指出，为保卫自己的安全和欧洲的和平，社会主义国家签订了华沙条约。
    本着缓和欧洲中心紧张局势的愿望，波兰政府提出了建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议。波兰政府支持苏联政府声明中再次提出的这一建议，它相信，实现这一建议就会对加强欧洲安全和和平的事业作出重要贡献。他说，现在有条件通过协商以及本着各国人民共处和合作的精神以解决争端的途径来巩固和平。我们希望，外长会议和计划中的大国首脑会议将有助于实现这一目的。
