Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 1st (TASS dispatch): TASS reporter Artemov said in an article that the process of Soviet collective farms transitioning to a system of paying members monetary wages on a monthly basis is currently developing rapidly. This appears to be one of the most important qualitative changes currently taking place in the Soviet countryside. Collective farms are gradually converging with modern state-owned enterprises in terms of their industrial production skills and commodity production rate. Artemov wrote in the article that thirty years ago, when the Soviet Union began to unite peasants into collective farms, life itself suggested a more reasonable labor wage system—namely, a wage system calculated by labor days. This wage system involved distributing the collective farm's income at the end of the year (after deducting certain social funds) to the farmers according to the number of labor days they had worked.

The reporter wrote that in the early days of the establishment of collective farms, when their commodity production was lower and their material foundation was insufficient, the labor day wage system was the only form that could guarantee the members a secured wage and monthly cash payment. This form could encourage farmers to participate in the entire collective farm's production and ensure payment according to work.

However, this wage system itself had its disadvantages. The most important was the hypothetical nature of labor remuneration because members could not accurately know how many labor days they could do in a year. In addition, the time between completing the work and paying the remuneration was also relatively long.

The reporter then wrote that in order to transition to a guaranteed daily payment of labor remuneration for members, collective farms must not only have a high level of production but also a solid financial foundation. The series of measures implemented in Soviet agriculture in the past five years has created conditions for a leap forward along the road of further developing the collective farm economy. The monetary income of collective farms has more than doubled in six years. It is precisely because of this that it has been possible for collective farms to transition to a guaranteed monthly payment of monetary wages.

    塔斯社记者评述由劳动日工资制过渡到货币工资制
    新华社莫斯科1日电　据塔斯社讯：塔斯社记者阿捷莫夫在一篇文章中说，目前苏联集体农庄过渡到按月支付庄员货币工资制的过程获得了急剧的发展，看来，这是目前苏联农村正在发生的最重要的质变象征之一。集体农庄在自己的工业生产技能和生产商品率方面逐渐与现代化的国营企业趋于同一水平。阿捷莫夫在文章中写道，三十年前，当苏联开始把农民团结到集体农庄中时，生活本身提示了更为合理的劳动工资制——即按劳动日计算的工资制。这种工资制是在年底把集体农庄的收入（除扣除它们的一定社会基金外）按照庄员所作的劳动日数分配给农民。
    记者写道，在集体农庄建立的初期，当它们的商品生产较少和物质基础不足时，为了保证庄员的有保障的工资和按月支付现金，劳动日工资制是唯一的一种形式，这种形式能够鼓励农民参加整个农庄的生产和保证按劳取酬。
    但是，这种工资制本身有它不利的一面，最主要的是劳动报酬的假定性，因为庄员在一年之内不能精确地知道能做多少劳动日，另外，在完成工作与支付报酬的时间也离得较远。
    记者接着写道，为了过渡到有保障的按日支付庄员的劳动报酬，集体农庄不仅有高度的生产，而且还要有一个稳固的财经基础。最近五年来，在苏联农业中所实行的一系列的措施，创造了沿着进一步发展集体农庄经济的道路跃进的条件。集体农庄的货币收入在六年内已增加了两倍多。正由于此，才有可能使集体农庄过渡到有保证的按月支付货币工资制。
