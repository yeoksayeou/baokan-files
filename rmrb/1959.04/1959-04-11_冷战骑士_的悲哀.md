The peaks of the Alps are still covered with thick snow, but the whole of Southern Europe has already donned the green attire of spring. Lake Como, a resort in northern Italy, is once again attracting its annual tourists with its charming lake scenery, azure sky, and echoing church bells.

The peak season for Lake Como is between late spring and early summer. However, the 83-year-old Mr. Konrad Adenauer has now decided to vacation there. As he prepared to leave Bonn for Lake Como, news was spreading that the West German Chancellor had been nominated as a candidate for the West German presidency, attracting much discussion in various countries. However, the serene and beautiful scenery around Lake Como will probably hardly calm Mr. Adenauer's confused mind. Because the situation at the leadership meeting of his party, the Christian Democratic Union, still lingers in his mind. At this meeting held on April 7, fifty-five party leaders preemptively passed a resolution, even without Adenauer's consent, asking him to give up the position of Chancellor and serve as a presidential candidate. Like a person who has lost his soul, Adenauer "meditated for two and a half hours" in his rose garden on the Rhine River, and finally reluctantly agreed to this decision. In West Germany's constitution, the Chancellor has the power to determine the government's policy direction, while the President is "strictly stipulated not to interfere in politics," its "position is higher but without real power." Therefore, Adenauer's nominal "promotion" is actually, in the words of Western news agencies, being "kicked upstairs."

This misfortune of Adenauer's had been brewing for some time. As early as April 1956, Adenauer was only willing to choose his two confidants, Kaiser and Hassel, as vice-chairmen of the Christian Democratic Union, but his party's national congress forced the old man to finally agree to elect two more people he disliked: Federal Council Speaker Gerstenmaier and the former chairman of North Rhine-Westphalia, Karl Arnold. The Associated Press said that Adenauer's failure within the party was the first since the war. Shortly afterward, someone even circulated a petition in the lower house of the Federal Parliament to oust him. In recent years, Adenauer has felt the threat from his subordinates even more. The most serious of these came from the "stocky, cigar-chomping" 62-year-old Bavarian, Deputy Chancellor and Minister of Economic Affairs Erhard. In order to prevent this dangerous opponent in advance, Adenauer had put pressure on Erhard to run as a presidential candidate. But unexpectedly, this ambitious Bavarian actually "paid him back in his own coin," instead wanting Adenauer to take a "step up," while expressing that he himself still wanted to "remain on the active political stage." In this recent parliamentary group meeting, this open and covert struggle finally ended with Adenauer's retirement.

One can see this change in Adenauer's political career as a result of the power struggles within his party. But the more important and deeper reason lies in the unpopularity of Adenauer's personal and arbitrary domestic and foreign policies. Adenauer has always been known as a stubbornly unyielding "Cold War knight." He opposes all proposals and suggestions that help to peacefully resolve the German question and ease international tensions, regardless of where they come from. As West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer said: Adenauer's "old trick" is: "Always say no, change nothing, keep everything as it is." "New York Times" commentator Reston believes that the close relationship between Adenauer and Dulles is of great importance to the policies of the "Western alliance," "and sometimes even decisive for the formulation of the entire NATO policy." The recent Washington meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which continued to adhere to its stubborn attitude on German policy, is also inseparable from the rigidity of Adenauer's foreign policy. According to Western news agencies, West German Foreign Minister Brentano, accepting Adenauer's instructions, "used all the arguments he could muster to harden Western policy" and "froze the attitude of the allies." British newspapers believe that "Adenauer hopes the current stalemate will continue."

Adenauer's policy not only made himself "no longer fully supported" and increasingly isolated, but also is dragging West Germany into a difficult and dangerous situation. Therefore, the British "Daily Express" wrote in an article entitled "The Conspiracy to Abandon Adenauer" some time ago: Those in West Germany who hope to overthrow Adenauer are "uneasy about his foreign policy," "dislike his lack of flexibility," and "most surprisingly, his plan to equip the German army with atomic weapons... undermines the possibility of reunification." Adenauer's ostensible promotion but actual demotion, of course, does not equate to a fundamental change in the current policy of the West German government. But at least it reflects that the extremely stubborn and unyielding policy Adenauer is now pursuing has become difficult to maintain without any change under the pressure of domestic and foreign people's demands for a peaceful resolution of the German question and the easing of tensions. In addition to this reason, the Christian Democratic Union now insists on discarding this old stubborn Adenauer also to clear obstacles for winning the victory in the general election scheduled for 1961.

According to reports, Adenauer will spend several weeks in this resort in Italy until the eve of the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference before returning to Bonn. During this period, thousands of thoughts will flood the mind of this current Prime Minister. The current disappointment may only be comforted by recalling the past. This Cologne citizen, born in the Bismarck era, was influenced by the spirit of "Greater Germany" and "great men" in his early years. But his experiences in the first half of his life do not seem to be smooth. Because it was not until the First World War that he climbed to the position of Mayor of Cologne and began to show his talent. His real "golden age" began after the Second World War. At the age of over sixty—seventy-three years old—he was supported by the Americans and put on the throne of West German Federal Chancellor. When West Germany joined the North Atlantic aggressive bloc in 1955, according to the "New York Times," Adenauer's career simply reached its "peak." In the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, where the North Atlantic Council meeting was held at that time, the red, black, and yellow tricolor flag of West Germany was flying for the first time among the other fourteen member countries. US Secretary of State Dulles couldn't help but call him a "great statesman." This could not but move the Prime Minister to tears, and he stated at the meeting that he would definitely do his best in his remaining years to realize his "ambition": to unify the entire Germany under his banner of imperialism and militarism.

However, the "peak" of victory is the beginning of failure. This policy of rearming and joining the North Atlantic bloc, while winning Dulles' applause, also aroused the opposition and contempt of the German people and the people of all countries in the world. Since then, Adenauer has been on the decline: "His prestige and health have declined as well." In recent years, the call for a peaceful resolution of the German question has become increasingly irresistible. Today, Adenauer is not only mentally and physically exhausted, but also alienated by the masses. In the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind and the German Democratic Republic is strong and consolidated, his "grand ambition" is even more渺茫. And waiting for this "Cold War knight" is a sad ending of being almost pushed out of West German real politics.

　　“冷战骑士”的悲哀
　　陈有为
    阿尔卑斯山的峰峦还复盖着厚厚的积雪，但是整个南欧却已披上了绿色的春装。意大利北部的疗养胜地科摩湖，现在又以它媚人的湖光山色，蓝湛湛的晴空，和回荡的教堂钟声开始吸引一年一度的观光者了。
    科摩湖的全盛季节是在春末夏初之交。但是八十三岁的康拉德·阿登纳先生现在就决定要到那里去度假了。当他准备离开波恩前往科摩湖的时候，关于这位西德总理已被推选为西德总统候选人的消息，正在传播开来，并且引起了各国舆论的许多议论。不过，科摩湖畔一片宁静幽美的景色，现在大概很难镇定阿登纳先生纷繁的心绪。因为在他的脑际仍然萦回着他的党——基督教民主联盟领导人员会议的情形。在4月7日举行的这次会议上，五十五名党的领导人甚至不等阿登纳的同意，就在会上先发制人地通过决议，要他放弃总理职位而充当总统候选人。阿登纳像一个丧魂落魄的人那样，在他来因河畔的玫瑰花园里“沉思两个半小时”以后，终于无可奈何地同意了这个决定。在西德的宪法里，总理有权决定政府的政策方针，而总统却被“严格规定不干预政治”，它的“职位更高而毫无实权”。因此，阿登纳名义上的“晋升”，实际上用西方通讯社的话来说是被人“踢到楼上”去了。
    阿登纳的这个厄运早就有苗头了。还在1956年4月时，阿登纳只愿挑他的两个亲信——凯撒和哈塞尔当基督教民主联盟的副主席，但是他的党的全国代表大会却逼使这个老头儿最后不得不同意另外再选两个他所厌恶的人：联邦议院议长格斯登美尔和北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州的前主席卡尔·阿诺德。美联社说阿登纳在党内的这种失败是战后的第一次。此后不久，有人甚至在联邦议院的下院中散发请愿书，要倒他下台。近年来，阿登纳更加感到他手下对于他的威胁。其中最严重的来自那个“身材矮胖，衔着雪茄”的六十二岁的巴伐利亚人、副总理兼经济部长艾哈德。为了预先防止这个危险的对手，阿登纳曾经对艾哈德施加压力，要他出任当总统候选人。但想不到这个野心勃勃的巴伐利亚人居然“以其人之道，还治其人之身”，反要阿登纳“高升”一步，而表示他自己还想“留在活跃的政治舞台上”。在最近这一次议会党团会议上，这一场明争暗斗，终于以阿登纳的引退而告终了。
    人们可以把阿登纳政治生涯的这种变迁，看成是他党内的争权夺利的结果。但更主要也更深刻的原因，还在于阿登纳的个人独断的内政外交的不得人心。阿登纳是一向以顽固不化的“冷战骑士”闻名的。他反对一切有助于和平解决德国问题和缓和国际紧张局势的主张和建议，不管它们来自任何方面。就像西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔所说的：“阿登纳的老一套”是：“永远说不，什么都不改变，原封不动”。“纽约时报”的评论员赖斯顿认为：阿登纳和杜勒斯之间的密切联系对“西方联盟”的政策有极大的重要性，“有时甚至对制订北大西洋公约组织的整个政策，都有决定性的意义”。最近北大西洋集团理事会华盛顿会议在对德政策上继续坚持其顽固态度，也是同阿登纳对外政策的僵硬分不开的。据西方通讯社报道，接受阿登纳指示的西德外长勃伦塔诺“利用了他所能拿出的全部论点来硬化西方政策”，“冻结了盟国的态度”。英国报纸认为，“阿登纳希望目前僵局继续下去”。
    阿登纳的这种政策不但使他自己“不再得到充分的支持”，日益孤立，而且也正在把西德拖入困难和危险的境地。因此，英国“每日快报”前些日子在一篇题为“抛弃阿登纳的阴谋”的文章中写道：西德那些希望推翻阿登纳的人对“他的外交政策惶惑不安”，
  “不喜欢他缺乏灵活性”，而“最令人惊奇的是他以原子武器装备德军的计划，……破坏了重新统一的可能性。”阿登纳的明升暗降，当然并不等于西德政府现行政策的根本改变。但至少反映了阿登纳现在奉行的这种极端顽固不化的政策，在国内外人民要求和平解决德国问题与缓和紧张局势的压力之下，已经很难再丝毫不改地坚持下去了。除了这个原因之外，基督教民主联盟现在所以一定要把阿登纳这尊老顽固扔开，也是为了给预定在1961年举行的大选中取得胜利扫除障碍。
    据消息报道，阿登纳将在意大利的这个疗养胜地度过几个星期，直到日内瓦东西方外长会议的前夕再返回波恩。在这一段日子里，千思万绪将会涌上这位现任总理先生的心头。眼下的失意也许只有从往事的回忆中去求得慰借了。这位出生在俾斯麦时代的科隆公民，早年就受到了“大德意志”“伟人”的精神的熏陶。但是前半生的经历似乎说不上顺利。因为直到第一次世界大战期间，他才爬到了科隆市长的地位而初露头角。他的真正的“黄金时代”还是从二次大战以后开始的。在已经年逾花甲——七十三岁那年，他被美国人捧上了西德联邦总理的宝座。而到1955年西德参加北大西洋侵略集团时，按照“纽约时报”的说法，阿登纳的事业简直达到了“顶点”。在当时举行北大西洋集团理事会的巴黎夏乐宫里，西德的红黑黄三色旗第一次飘扬在其他十四个成员国中间。美国国务卿杜勒斯情不自禁地称他为“伟大的政治家”。这不能不使这位总理先生感动得老泪纵横，而在会上表示：一定要尽他的余年之力来实现自己的“壮志”：让整个德国都统一到他的帝国主义和军国主义旗帜下来。
    但是，“胜利”的顶点却是失败的开始。重新武装起来参加北大西洋集团的这种政策，虽然博得了杜勒斯的喝彩，却同时也招来了德国人民和世界各国人民的反对与唾弃。从这以后，阿登纳就走下坡路了：“他的威望和健康一样地衰退”。这些年来，要求和平解决德国问题的呼声越来越势不可挡。到了今天，阿登纳不但心劳日拙，而且众叛亲离。在东风压倒西风和德意志民主共和国强大巩固的今天，他的“宏愿”是更加渺茫了。而等待着这个“冷战骑士”的，却是一个几乎要被从西德的实际政治中排挤出去的可悲的结局。
