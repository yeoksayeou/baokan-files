    The Furnace is Dead…
    Huang Han
    Zhang Wenjin, an advanced producer at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company’s open-hearth steelmaking plant, recently said: “Last year, I created the ‘two-step charging method,’ which was a successful experiment achieved by thoroughly liberating my mind, with the support of the Party and the help of my comrades. I remember that during the experiment, I not only encountered many difficulties, but also faced opposition from people with conservative ideas who said I was ‘determined to break the furnace.’ But I did not get discouraged. I relied closely on the Party and the masses, and after fifteen consecutive trials, I finally succeeded, increasing steel production by eight to ten tons per furnace without prolonging the smelting time. This made me further realize: the furnace is dead, but people are alive. As long as we break superstitions, dare to think and dare to act, we can definitely find new ways to increase steel production.”
    "The furnace is dead, but people are alive." This phrase is concise and meaningful, and thought-provoking.
    Everything in nature is constantly changing and moving, which is absolute; but compared to people, they are relatively less "alive." People not only have life, but also have hands, feet, and brains, as well as complex thoughts and wisdom. This enables people to gradually dominate nature. Lenin said that human intelligence has discovered many amazing things in nature and will discover even more, thereby increasing its power over nature.
    People are "alive," and "alive" people can, according to the laws of things themselves, make them serve us humans according to our will. Water flows downwards, but we humans, based on its laws, lead it up the mountain. Black things easily absorb sunlight and heat. The people and scientific departments of Gansu Province sprinkled black substances such as grass and wood ash on the ice and snow of the Qilian Mountains to advance and expand the melting of ice and snow, solving the water conservancy problems of farmland in the Hexi region. Of course, the so-called "people are alive" and "things are dead" should not be absolutized—we cannot exaggerate the subjective initiative of people to the point where it can transcend the laws of things; only according to the laws of things can people dominate things.

### 炉子是死的……

    炉子是死的……
  　黄涵
    重庆钢铁公司平炉炼钢厂先进生产者张文金最近说：“去年，我创造‘两步装料法’，就是彻底解放思想，在党的支持和同志们的帮助下试验成功的。记得在试验过程中，我不光是遇到了许多困难，还遇到有保守思想的人的反对，说我是‘安心要把炉子装垮’。但我没有泄气，我紧紧依靠党和群众，连续试验十五炉，终于成功了，每炉增产钢八至十吨，冶炼时间并没有拖长。这使我更进一步体会到：炉子是死的，人是活的，只要破除迷信，敢想敢干，增产钢的新办法一定能找到。”
    “炉子是死的，人是活的”，这话词简意赅，耐人深思。
    自然界的万物总都是在变化着和运动着的，这是绝对的；但它们和人比较，相对地来说，又都不如人来得那样“活”。人不唯有生命，而且有手脚和脑袋，还有复杂的思想和智慧。这使人能够逐步支配自然。列宁说过，人的智力在自然界中曾经发现了许多惊人的东西，并且还将发现更多惊人的东西，因而增加着它对于自然界的支配力。
    人是“活”的，“活”的人能够根据物本身的规律，让它们按照人的意志为我们人类服务。水是往下流的，我们人根据它的规律把它引上了山。黑色的东西容易吸收阳光和热，甘肃省的人民和科学部门就在祁连山冰雪上撒上草木灰等黑色物质，提早和扩大冰雪的融化，解决了河西地区农田的水利问题。当然，所谓人是“活”的，东西是“死”的，也不能把它绝对化——不能把人的主观能动作用，夸大到了可以超越事物的规律性；只有根据事物的规律，人才能支配物。
