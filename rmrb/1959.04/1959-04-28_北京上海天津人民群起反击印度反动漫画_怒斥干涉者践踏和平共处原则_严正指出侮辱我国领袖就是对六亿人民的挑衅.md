Xinhua News Agency, April 27th. The people of all circles in the capital, upon seeing that some Indian newspapers published cartoons insulting our leaders, were filled with indignation and gathered to express their belief that this was a serious act of provocation and must be resolutely opposed.

More than 10,000 members and cadres of the China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune, after reading the "Indian Times" and the Indian "Mail" carrying cartoons insulting our leaders, were extremely indignant. They unanimously wrote to the People's Daily expressing their determination to resolutely counterattack the Indian expansionists' shameless conspiracy to deviate from the spirit of the Bandung Conference, undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and instigate the Tibetan rebellion. Wu Zhiren, a member of the Nanyuan People's Commune, said: "Some bad elements in India, insulting our most beloved leaders, are provoking our 600 million people. We are very angry and firmly oppose them."

Workers at the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, after seeing the photos of the crimes committed by the Khampa rebels, angrily said that these extremely savage and brutal rebels were not religious believers at all, but beasts in human skin. The Indian expansionists are supporting such people, which makes it easy to see what kind of faces the Indian expansionists have.

At a forum held by workers at the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, workers Meng Fuyan, Qin Ziping, Zhang Yong'an, and others angrily said: "Recently, Indian thugs have organized anti-China demonstrations in front of the Chinese Embassy in India and insulted our national leaders. This kind of crazy and barbaric action can only more clearly expose their ambition to interfere in China's internal affairs. We express our firm opposition."

Shanghai

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 27th. This afternoon, the people of Shanghai, seeing the two cartoons reprinted in the People's Daily from the "Indian Times" and "Mail" that compared our leaders to "snowmen" and "savages," were extremely angry. People gathered and held forums, questioning the Indian expansionists and the Indian authorities: Is this the attitude one should have towards a friendly neighbor? Is this the adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that Indian politicians are constantly proclaiming? Next to these two cartoons were five photos exposing the atrocities of the Khampa rebels, and some of the leaders of these rebels are now in India, receiving "courtesies" from some people in India. People indignantly questioned: What exactly is the Indian expansionists' motive for supporting this small group of rebels who skin and flay people, and for reversing right and wrong, calling the rebellion a "people's revolution," and repeatedly expressing "sympathy" for the Tibetan rebellion?

After work, the workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard saw the day's People's Daily and, without even changing their clothes, immediately began discussing it indignantly on the shipways and in the workshops. Chen Xingxin, an old worker in the machine repair workshop, said angrily: "The Indian expansionists have gone from supporting the Tibetan rebellion and undermining our country's unity to blatantly and directly insulting our leaders, which further exposes their reactionary nature."

When the newspaper arrived at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, the workers in the steel casting workshop all rushed to the dispatch room. When they saw the Indian reactionary cartoons and the photos of the rebels' crimes in the newspaper, there was a great uproar. Cao Dabang, the foreman of the gas furnace, said: "We warn these Indian expansionists to clear their heads. China is no longer a country that can be bullied and trampled upon." The workers unanimously expressed that they would go all out, speed up production, and use the practical action of overfulfilling the state plan to counterattack foreign interferers.

Faculty and students of Fudan University gathered again today to denounce the Indian expansionists and some Indian politicians who openly interfere in our internal affairs. Zhu Dongrun, director of the Chinese Department, said indignantly: "I cannot help but feel extremely angry that the Indian expansionists dare to openly insult our leaders." Meng Xiancheng, president of East China Normal University, said excitedly after reading today's People's Daily: "The upper-class reactionary group in Tibet is guilty of heinous crimes; the Indian expansionists, on the one hand, sympathize with the Tibetan rebels, and on the other hand, clamor to slander and vilify our leaders. Is this to maintain Sino-Indian friendship, or to undermine Sino-Indian friendship? Is it to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and India, or to trample on these five principles?"

In recent days, people from religious, medical, literary, and minority circles in Shanghai have also held forums, unanimously and solemnly pointing out that the facts are now glaringly obvious, and the Indian expansionists' conspiracy to use the Tibet issue to interfere in our internal affairs and undermine our country's unity has been completely exposed.

Tianjin

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 27th. The broad masses of the people in Tianjin, after seeing the reactionary remarks and cartoons in the Indian reactionary press that slander our leaders and interfere in our internal affairs, were extremely angry and unanimously condemned the Indian expansionists, expressing their determination to step up production to counterattack foreign interferers.

Workers at the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant held meetings and wrote big-character posters, denouncing the shameless behavior of the Indian expansionists. The big-character poster posted by the youth steelmaking furnace Yu Junyou group said that the 650 million Chinese people are not to be deceived, and if the Indian expansionists are obsessed, they will surely be battered and bloody. Wang Qifa, the stoker who was directing steelmaking, said: "I have decided to use the practical action of making more steel and high-quality steel to counterattack the Indian expansionists' provocations against our country."

More than 2,500 representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers from the industrial, transportation, and capital construction sectors of Hebei Province, who are attending a meeting in Tianjin, unanimously condemned the unreasonable behavior of the Indian expansionists in openly slandering our people's leaders. They said that any shameless conspiracy by Indian expansionists to use the Tibetan rebellion to realize their expansionist ambitions will never succeed.

More than 9,000 faculty, students, and staff of Tianjin University held a radio rally. Professor Fan Enkun, deputy director of the Civil Engineering Department, said with irrepressible anger: "The Indian expansionists have completely trampled on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We solemnly warn these expansionists: do not take our Chinese people's friendly and patient attitude towards neighboring countries as weakness and bullying. The Chinese people who have stood up will surely give a heavy counterattack to this serious provocation."

All the cadres of the Tianjin Women's Federation expressed with great anger that the Indian authorities not only disregarded our people's stern warnings and failed to take effective measures to stop the acts of interfering in our internal affairs, but also allowed the reactionary newspapers to slander our great leaders, which we can no longer tolerate. We once again warn the Indian expansionists that any conspiracy to interfere in our internal affairs will be defeated. (Attached picture)

Teachers of the Political Education Department of Beijing Normal University, after reading the cartoons in the Indian reactionary newspapers that viciously insulted our leaders, immediately wrote to the People's Daily, expressing their great anger.

    新华社上海27日电　今天下午，上海人民看到人民日报转载的“印度时报”和“邮报”的两幅把我国领导人比作“雪人”和“野蛮人”的漫画，愤怒到了极点。人们纷纷集会、座谈，质问印度扩张主义分子和印度当局：难道这是对一个友好邻邦应有的态度吗？这就是印度政治家们口口声声宣扬的坚持和平共处五项原则吗？这两幅漫画的旁边是揭露的康巴叛乱分子暴行的五张照片，而这些叛乱分子的一些头领，现在正在印度，受着印度某些人士的“礼遇”，人们义愤地责问：印度扩张主义分子，支持这一小撮抽人筋、剥人皮的叛乱分子，并颠倒是非，把叛乱说成是什么“人民的革命”，对西藏叛乱一再表示“同情”，骨子里究竟是为了什么？
    江南造船厂的工人下班以后，看到当天的人民日报，来不及换衣服，立即在船台上、车间里，激愤地讨论起来。修机车间老工人陈杏新愤怒地说：“印度扩张主义分子从支持西藏叛乱，破坏我国统一，进一步明目张胆地直接侮辱我国领导人员，这就进一步暴露出他们的反动本质。”

    连日来，上海市举行座谈会的还有宗教界、医务界、文艺界和少数民族的人士，人们一致严正地指出：现在事实已经昭然若揭，印度扩张主义分子阴谋利用西藏问题来干涉我国内政，破坏我国统一的阴谋，已经彻底败露。
