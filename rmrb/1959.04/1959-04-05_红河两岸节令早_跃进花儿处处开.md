    Red River Banks See Early Season, Leap Forward Flowers Blooming Everywhere
    Yunnan
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 4th: As of March 27th, the 600,000-strong army of spring planting in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province had sown over 600,000 mu of early rice, mid-season rice, cotton, corn, sugarcane, flue-cured tobacco, and sweet potatoes. Many people's communes have nearly completed their spring planting plans. The Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture is located in a subtropical zone, where the agricultural season is inherently early. This year, based on the experience of last year's early planting and harvesting, the people of all ethnic groups have further advanced the sowing time. Now, on both banks of the Honghe River, the early rice fields are a lush green, the water surface of the mid-season rice seedling fields is showing new buds, the early sown cotton is breaking ground, and the early sown wheat is expected to have a bumper harvest and will soon be harvested in a few days.
    The Honghe River originates from Erhai Lake in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture and flows through most areas of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture. The land on both sides is fertile and suitable for the growth of multiple crops year-round. At the beginning of March, spring planting activities began here. In many places, a great leap forward situation has emerged with seven sets of gongs and drums beating simultaneously for sowing early rice, cotton, sugarcane, mid-season rice seedling cultivation, sweet potato seedling cultivation, fertilizer accumulation, and fertilizer delivery. This year's spring plowing and planting are not only progressing quickly but also of high quality. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 80 billion jin of fertilizer have been prepared for spring sowing in various parts of the autonomous prefecture, greatly exceeding previous years. Dozens of improved varieties of early and mid-season rice have been promoted, and the fields have been deeply plowed better than in previous years. The Hani ethnic group's commune members praised the spring planting scene this year, saying: "A single tree does not make a forest, a single stone does not make a mountain. With the establishment of people's communes, leap forward flowers bloom everywhere."

    红河两岸节令早  跃进花儿处处开
    云南
    据新华社昆明4日电　云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州的六十万春种大军到3月27日止，已播种早稻、中稻、棉花、玉米、甘蔗、烤烟、红薯等六十多万亩，许多人民公社的春种计划已接近完成。红河哈尼族彝族自治州地处亚热带，农事节令本来就早，今年各族人民根据去年早种早栽的丰收经验，更提早了播种时间。现在，红河两岸，早稻田一片油绿，中稻秧田水面已露出新芽，早播的棉花正在破土，去冬早播的小麦丰收在望，再过几天就要开镰收割了。
    红河发源于大理白族自治州洱海，流经红河哈尼族彝族自治州内大部分地区，两岸土地肥沃，常年宜于多种作物成长。3月初，这里就开始了春种活动，许多地方都出现了播种早稻、棉花、甘蔗、中稻育秧、红薯育秧和积肥、送肥等七套锣鼓一齐响的大跃进局面。今年的春耕春种不但进展速度快，而且质量高。据不完全统计：自治州各地为春播准备的肥料近八百亿斤，大大超过了往年，并且推广了早、中稻良种数十种，田地深翻得也都比往年好。哈尼族的社员们称赞今年的春种情景说：独木不成材，独石不成岩，人民公社办起来，跃进花儿处处开。
