　　Japanese Communist Party and Socialist Party Leaders Meet
　　No Disagreements on Peace and National Independence Issues
　　Confirm that US Imperialism is the Common Enemy of the People of Japan and China
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: According to today's "Akahata" report, Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto and Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma held talks on the 6th.

    During the talks, both sides agreed that US imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Japan and China. Both sides also pointed out that the American people should not be regarded as enemies of the people of Japan and China.

    The meeting was held in the Diet Building. Takeji Torao, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, also attended the meeting.

    Inejiro Asanuma said during the talks that it is natural for the Socialist Party to strive for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. He pointed out that China should be the first country that Japan should conclude a peace treaty with after the war, because China is the country that suffered the most from the Japanese war of aggression.

    The Socialist Party Secretary-General advocated that Japan should sever all military ties with the United States, pursue a policy of active neutrality, and not participate in any military blocs.

    Kenji Miyamoto expressed support for the Socialist Party's policy on Japan-China relations. He said that there are no differences between China and the Japanese Socialist Party, and between the Japanese Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party, on the issue of defending peace and national independence.

    Kenji Miyamoto expressed hope that the Socialist Party would, based on the joint statement issued by Inejiro Asanuma and Zhang Xiruo, resolutely strike at the enemies of peace and national independence.

　　日本共产党和社会党领袖会谈
　　双方对和平和民族独立问题没有分歧
　　确认美帝国主义是日中两国人民公敌
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党总书记宫本显治和社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在6日举行了会谈。
    在会谈中，双方一致认为，美帝国主义是日本和中国两国人民的共同敌人。双方还一致指出不应该认为美国人民也是日中两国人民的敌人。
    会谈是在国会大厦举行的。出席会谈的还有共产党中央干部会委员听涛克己。
    浅沼稻次郎在会谈中说，社会党为争取早日恢复日本和中国的外交关系而努力，这是很自然的。他指出，中国应该是日本在战后首先要同它缔结和约的国家，因为中国是遭受日本发动的侵略战争灾害最大的国家。
    这位社会党书记长主张日本断绝同美国的一切军事关系，奉行积极的中立政策，而不要参加任何军事集团。
    宫本显治表示支持社会党关于日中关系方面的政策。他说，中国同日本社会党之间，以及日本社会党同日本共产党之间在保卫和平和民族独立问题上是没有分歧的。
    宫本显治表示希望社会党根据浅沼稻次郎和张奚若发表的共同声明，坚决打击和平和民族独立的敌人。
