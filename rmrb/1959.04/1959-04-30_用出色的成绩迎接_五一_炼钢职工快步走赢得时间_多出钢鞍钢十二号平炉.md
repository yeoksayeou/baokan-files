    Using Outstanding Achievements to Welcome "May Day"
    Steelmaking Workers Speed Up to Gain Time
    Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 12 Open Hearth Furnace Produces More Steel
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 29th—The workers of the No. 12 open hearth furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Steelmaking Plant skillfully overcame the challenge of furnace body maintenance. They overfulfilled the April production plan by more than 250 tons of high-quality steel six days ahead of schedule, and the furnace bottom utilization coefficient increased by 1.54 tons compared to the average in March.
    This open hearth furnace was originally scheduled to undergo four days of maintenance in April to re-brick the furnace body. In order to produce more high-quality steel for the country in April, the skilled steelmakers strengthened the maintenance of the furnace body. They learned from the experience of the Youth Solidarity Furnace and the No. 15 open hearth furnace, and used a mixture of dolomite, iron filings, magnesia refractory mud, and tar to repair the furnace before the steel was completely melted, ensuring the normal production of the furnace's front wall. The workers of the C shift did an particularly excellent job of maintaining the furnace body. In addition, this open hearth furnace also received strong support and cooperation from workers in various brother work sections in April. The operators launched a red flag competition for charging materials, greatly shortening the time for charging a furnace, which shortened the time for each furnace of steel by 23 minutes compared to March.

    According to this newspaper, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company completed the state plans for steel, iron, steel materials, and cast pipes ahead of schedule in April. Among them, steel production was completed two days ahead of schedule on the 28th. The qualified rate of steel ingots reached 98.44%; the production of pig iron and cast pipes was completed three days ahead of schedule; and the production of steel materials was completed five days ahead of schedule.
    The company launched a "three-high" competition for high output, high quality, and high efficiency in April. At the beginning of April, the company's factories formulated a gift plan to welcome "May Day" and improve the production level. All employees of the company launched a mass movement to implement measures around the gift plan. The Ironmaking Plant adopted measures such as increasing smelting intensity and desulfurization outside the furnace. The recent production level of No. 1 blast furnace has increased by 17.5% compared with March, with average daily production exceeding March by one hundred tons of pig iron, and the utilization factor reaching above 1.7. The steelmaking workers in the converter workshop have realized measures to expand the volume of the converter, and the production level has increased every ten days. The output of qualified steel per furnace has increased by more than 500 kilograms.

    Three Steelmaking Units in Qingdao
    Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao—Good news comes from Qingdao City, one of Shandong Province's major steelmaking regions: After launching a high-yield, high-quality red flag competition, the steelmaking units of Qingdao Steel Plant No. 5, Qingdao State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6, and the steelmaking workshop of the Vehicle Factory completed the April steel production plan nine days ahead of schedule on the 21st.
    In the process of carrying out the competition, the steelmaking workshop of the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 established a "three-comparison competition board" to compare output, quality, and cost, and conducted daily shift-based statistics and evaluations, which greatly encouraged the employees. In terms of operation, they promoted advanced experience, which increased the average daily output by 54.18% compared to March, the qualified product rate reached 95.52%, and the cost was also reduced by 9.59% compared to March.
    The steelmaking workshop of Qingdao Vehicle Factory not only completed the April steel production plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, but also achieved 71.75% of grade-one steel, and the cost decreased by 16.72% compared to March. After learning from the experience of the steelmaking workshop of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6, Qingdao Steel Plant No. 5 increased its average daily output by 1.42 times compared to the previous month.

    用出色的成绩迎接“五一”
    炼钢职工快步走赢得时间
    多出钢鞍钢十二号平炉
    新华社鞍山29日电　鞍钢第二炼钢厂十二号平炉的职工巧破炉体维护关，提前六天超产二百五十多吨优质钢完成了4月份生产计划，炉底利用系数比3月份平均提高一点五四吨。
    这座平炉原计划在4月份要检修四天，重新砌炉体砖。炼钢能手们为了在4月里给国家多增产优质钢，加强了对炉体的维护工作。他们学习了青年团结炉和十五号平炉的经验，在炼钢未熔化完以前就用白云石掺铁皮、镁火泥、焦油混合补炉，保证了炉子前墙的正常生产。丙班工人维护炉体特别出色。此外，这座平炉4月以来还得到了各兄弟工段工人的大力支援和配合。运转手们展开装料红旗竞赛，装一炉料的时间大大缩短，从而使这座平炉每炼一炉钢的时间比3月份缩短了二十三分钟。石钢
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司提前完成4月份钢、铁、钢材、铸管国家计划，其中钢产量已于28日提前两天完成。钢锭合格率达到98.44％；生铁和铸管产量提前三天完成；钢材产量提前五天完成。
    这个公司在四月份开展了高产、高质、高效率的三高竞赛，4月初公司所属各厂即制订了迎接“五一”，把生产水平提高一步的献礼计划，全公司职工都围绕着献礼计划展开了大搞措施的群众运动。炼铁厂采取提高冶炼强度和炉外脱硫等措施，一高炉最近的生产水平比3月份提高了17.5％，平均每天比3月份多出一百吨生铁，利用系数达到了一点七以上。转炉车间的炼钢工人实现了扩大转炉容积的措施，生产水平逐旬提高。每炉的合格钢产量增加了五百公斤以上。

    青岛三个炼钢单位
    新华社讯山东省主要炼钢地区之一的青岛市传来捷报：青岛钢铁五厂、青岛国棉六厂和车辆厂的炼钢车间三个炼钢单位，开展高产优质红旗竞赛运动后，提前九天于21日完成4月份产钢计划。
    国棉六厂炼钢车间在开展竞赛中，建立比产量、质量、成本的“三比竞赛牌”，按日分班统计评比，对职工的鼓舞很大。在操作方面，他们推广先进经验，使平均日产量比3月份提高54.18％，产品合格率达到95.52％，成本也比3月份降低9.59％。
    青岛车辆厂炼钢车间不仅提前超额完成4月份产钢计划，而且一级钢占到71.75％，成本比3月份下降16.72％。青岛钢铁五厂在学习了国棉六厂炼钢车间的经验后平均日产量比上月提高1.42倍。
