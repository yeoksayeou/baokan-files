　　On Close Planting

　　Plants possess an extraordinary ability to transform air, soil moisture, and simple inorganic nutrients into complex organic substances like starch, sugar, fiber, and fats under sunlight. Dry matter in crops, excluding water, consists of 90% to 95% organic material. Approximately nine-tenths of these organic substances are created through this remarkable plant capacity known as "photosynthesis." Crop yield depends on the quantity of organic matter produced through "photosynthesis." This process primarily occurs in the leaves, where air, water, and nutrients are initially processed before being transported elsewhere for further refinement. Close planting aims to maximize the total leaf area available for "photosynthesis," thereby optimizing the utilization of soil moisture, nutrients, air, and solar light and heat to produce the most organic matter, fostering abundant, rapid, large, and high-quality growth of roots, stems, leaves, and particularly fruits and seeds.

　　Too Sparse or Too Dense is Undesirable

　　If crops are planted too sparsely, the available nutrients, water, sunlight, air, etc., will be wasted, preventing the attainment of maximum yield.

　　Conversely, if crops are planted too densely, exceeding a certain limit, the needs of the crops for nutrients, sunlight, etc., cannot be met, hindering normal growth and also preventing the attainment of maximum yield.

　　High yields can only be achieved by ensuring both the maximum number of plants per unit area and that each plant fully utilizes "photosynthesis," resulting in robust plants with long, large ears and plump, heavy grains.

　　Many examples illustrate that, under certain conditions and within certain limits, denser planting leads to higher yields; however, lacking certain conditions or exceeding certain limits results in decreased yields.

　　In 1958, the Shandong Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute conducted a close planting experiment with summer corn. Under favorable water and fertilizer conditions, using medium-maturity corn varieties, they planted between 666 and 13,332 plants per mu. The highest yield was obtained with 5,328 plants per mu. Starting from 8,000 plants per mu, the higher the density, the lower the yield. Plots with over 10,000 plants per mu received significantly more fertilizer but still yielded less.

　　Last year, the Unity Production Team of the Qianrenqiao Commune in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, had 2.4 mu of medium rice planted at a close spacing of 3x5 inches, yielding 3,005 jin per mu. Another 3 mu of the same variety, under the same conditions, were planted at 2x5 inches, which resulted in lodging after the ears emerged, yielding only 610 jin per mu. The Chongyang Production Team of the same commune had 1.3 mu of "Nante No." early rice planted at 3x6 inches, yielding 4,742 jin per mu. Under the same conditions, another plot of early rice was sparsely planted at 8x12 inches, yielding only 370 jin per mu. According to investigations in Shucheng, the highest yields last year were obtained with densities between 3x5 inches, 3x6 inches, and 4x6 inches. Denser planting resulted in fewer tillers, lodging, and more empty grains, leading to lower yields; sparser planting resulted in more ineffective tillers and wasted land and sunlight, also leading to lower yields.

　　Last year, in the Meishan Brigade of the Wuxing Commune in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, many paddy fields were fertilized with over 300 dan of farmyard manure per mu and planted with the "Hongmi Early" rice variety. Those with a close spacing of 5x3 inches yielded over 100 jin per mu more than those with 5x2 inches, and over 50 jin per mu more than those with 5x4 inches. The paddy fields of the Shexing Brigade with 5x2 inches spacing had a significantly increased yield compared to the sparse planting in 1957, but yielded over 200 jin per mu less than those with 5x3 inches.

　　An old farmer in this commune said, "Load the cannon with the right amount of powder to ensure the loudest and most accurate shot." This analogy is excellent. The specific conditions of each field vary, so different densities should be determined for each field.

　　Breaking Through Conventions

　　Too sparse is undesirable, and too dense is also undesirable. So, how dense is ideal? This cannot be generalized and must be determined based on the conditions. There are two types of conditions: one is man-made conditions, such as deep plowing, fertilizer, water conservancy, tools, the amount and skill of labor, and the strength of leadership; the other is natural conditions, such as climate, geology, soil quality, sunlight, and the characteristics of the crops themselves. Generally speaking, the man-made conditions on China's agricultural front are much better than they were a few years ago, and the ability to conquer and adapt to natural conditions has also greatly increased. Thus, the degree of close planting can be greatly increased compared to the past.

　　Previously, some agricultural scientists did not comprehensively and systematically examine the interrelationships between various conditions and close planting. They conducted isolated close planting experiments under conditions of shallow plowing and little fertilizer, thus reaching the erroneous conclusion that rice should not exceed 30,000 holes or 300,000 ears per mu, believing that more ears would reduce the number of grains per ear, more plants would cause lodging, and yields would decrease. Last year, under the leadership of the Party, Chinese farmers greatly demonstrated their creativity and initiative, and this "limit" of rice close planting has been broken.

　　According to statistics from fifteen mu of high-yielding fields in Zhejiang that yielded over 2,000 jin per mu last year, twelve mu had over 700,000 effective ears per mu, and three mu had over 1 million ears. Advanced farmers also reformed a series of cultivation techniques centered on close planting. Some people previously believed that too much fertilizer would cause rice to lodge, which was also a conclusion reached under conditions of shallow plowing and sparse planting; after deep plowing and close planting, the rational amount of fertilizer greatly exceeded the "limit" set by people in the past.

　　Furthermore, according to a survey of 48 single-cropping late rice fields in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province: those with about 250,000 ears per mu had an average of 67.03 grains per ear; those with 300,000 ears had 67.17 grains; those with 350,000 ears had 62.46 grains; and those with 700,000 ears had 59.86 grains. Compared to the first two densities, the number of ears increased by 50,000 (one-fifth), while the number of grains per ear did not decrease; compared to the latter two densities, the number of ears doubled, while the number of grains per ear only decreased by 2.6 grains, a decrease of 4.2%.

　　In the past, many people also believed that if the density of wheat exceeded 500,000 ears per mu, it would lodge and become small-eared with few grains. However, in 1958, many high-yielding fields with yields of over 3,000 jin per mu had over 1 million ears per mu; the wheat in these fields was not only large-eared, numerous-eared, grain-rich, and heavy-grained, but also did not lodge. The reason is that measures to increase production, such as soil, fertilizer, water, and seeds, as well as sowing and management techniques, have been greatly improved.

　　The same is true for other crops. Take soybeans, for example, which have always been considered "killed" if planted too densely. This is also a conclusion drawn under past conditions of shallow plowing, little fertilizer, or even no fertilizer. In fact, under certain conditions and within certain limits, after increasing the density of soybeans, although the number of branches per plant will decrease somewhat, the increase in yield due to the increase in the number of plants greatly exceeds the loss from the decrease in the number of branches.

　　Determine Density Based on Conditions

　　How dense is ideal? It should be determined based on the existing experience of various regions and with reference to changes in specific conditions. At the same time, efforts should be made to create better conditions for close planting.

　　In the rice experimental fields of Duotian Township, Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, one plot was planted with 81,521 holes per mu, plowed to a depth of eight inches, with roots distributed to a depth of 24 centimeters and a width of 12 centimeters, yielding 5,333 jin per mu. Another plot was planted with 53,667 holes per mu, plowed to a depth of five inches, with roots distributed to a depth of about 15 centimeters and a width of 8 centimeters, yielding 1,203 jin per mu.

　　At the Liuzhou Work Station of the Guangxi Agricultural Science Research Institute, on the same experimental field, one side was planted with 300,000 seedlings per mu, with sufficient fertilizer, and the average number of grains per ear at harvest was 97 to 123, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. The other side was planted with 500,000 to 800,000 seedlings per mu, with more seedlings and more ears, but lacking fertilizer, and the number of grains per ear at harvest was only 30 to 47, with a yield of just over 1,000 jin per mu.

　　In the Lianmeng Brigade of the Wuxing Commune in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, under the same close planting conditions, the use of the "Sandong Early" japonica rice variety yielded 184 jin per mu more than the general "Hongmi Early" seed; in close planting fields under the same conditions in the plain area, deep plowing to one foot yielded 200 jin per mu more than plowing to six inches.

　　The density should also vary depending on the crop cultivation period. Early rice has a short growth period, the temperature is not high during the tillering stage, and the temperature rises during the heading stage, so the heading is early and fast. Planting it slightly denser can promote early maturity and provide a reserve number of plants in case some seedlings do not tiller due to the cold weather, so that the total number of plants does not decrease excessively. The characteristics of medium rice are similar to those of early rice, but it coincides with high temperatures after transplanting, and tillering is earlier, making it prone to row closure, so it should be planted sparser than early rice. The temperature is even higher when late rice is transplanted, making it easier to tiller and close rows, so it should be sparser than medium rice.

　　Among early, medium, and late rice, the density should also vary depending on the variety. The early Sha Geng variety does not tiller as easily as the indica rice "Nante No.", so it can be denser; the early-maturing "Guihua Qiu" medium rice can be denser than the "Huangke Early" which is of the same type but matures slightly later.

　　For the same variety, the density should also vary depending on the time of transplanting. For example, early rice planted earlier can be denser than early rice planted later because the temperature is not high; conversely, late rice planted later should be denser than late rice planted earlier because of insufficient vegetative growth and a smaller amount of tillering and a high mortality rate.

　　Efforts should be made to adapt the density to the characteristics of the crop variety, and efforts should also be made to cultivate varieties suitable for close planting. For example, the "Duotao Cotton" selected by the masses in Linzhang County, Hebei Province, and the "Furong Cotton" selected by the Furong Farm in Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, are both new varieties with tall stems, short branches, many bolls, and deep roots, which are suitable for close planting.

　　Improve Planting Methods

　　Under the same number of plants per mu, different planting methods will also result in considerable differences in yield.

　　One of the main methods to improve planting methods is to rationally adjust the spacing between plants and rows. Generally speaking, cultivated crops (corn, rice, cotton, etc.) should focus on reducing the spacing between plants while maintaining a certain row spacing; non-cultivated crops (wheat, etc.) should distribute plants as evenly as possible and ensure that each plant has a certain nutritional area. Regardless of the crop, the needs of ventilation and light transmission and the convenience of field management should be considered when determining row spacing and plant spacing; at the same time, the characteristics of the crop should also be considered.

　　Experiments at the Guanghui Farm of Shenyang Agricultural College have shown that rectangular close planting of rice is better than square close planting. With the same amount of seedlings per mu, rectangular close planting tillers earlier and accumulates more nutrients. For the same variety with 300,000 seedlings per mu, 6x6 inches spacing yielded 77.57 grains per ear and 793.1 jin per mu; 6x3 inches spacing yielded 79.4 grains per ear and 862.7 jin per mu. With 300,000 seedlings per mu, 6x6 inches spacing yielded 826.9 jin per mu; 6x3 inches spacing yielded 918.9 jin per mu. Square close planting with 4x4 inches and 3x3 inches spacing became closed during the peak tillering period, with poor ventilation and light transmission, and it was not conducive to field management, resulting in weak plants and more ineffective tillers.

　　The cotton planted in Daxinzhuang, Linqing, Shandong last year, with the same 4,444 plants per mu, yielded 8.6% more with a row spacing of two chi than with a row spacing of one chi and eight cun, and 18% more than with a row spacing of one chi and five cun.

　　Another method to improve planting methods is rational intercropping. For example, crops with taller stems such as corn and cotton can be intercropped with crops with shorter stems or more shade-tolerant crops such as potatoes and beans. Multi-row intercropping is more effective than single-row intercropping.

　　Sichuan Province is promoting "directional cultivation" of corn (growing leaves neatly in the same direction), which is also a way to improve planting methods.

　　Rely on Main Ears? Rely on Tillers?

　　More ears may lead to increased production. How to increase the number of ears? For crops with tillering characteristics, there are two different opinions. Some advocate relying on the main ears, that is: to make a single plant grow from a single seed as much as possible, so that the nutrients absorbed by this plant are concentrated on this single plant, and large ears grow on this single plant; and believe that this can reduce or even eliminate ineffective tillers, and can make the ripening time of the ears consistent. Others advocate relying on tillers, that is: the amount of sowing may not be increased or increased less, and various methods are used to make each crop tiller more and produce more ears; and believe that this is suitable for the nature of crops with tillering characteristics.

　　Which view is correct? It cannot be fully concluded at present. Judging from some situations, it should rely mainly on the main ears, and also have an appropriate number of effective tillers.

　　Judging from the situation of spring wheat in Delingha Farm, Qinghai Province last year: with 28 jin of seeds per mu, there were 474 ears per square meter, the main ears accounted for 52.1%, the average number of grains per main ear was 26.9, the average number of ineffective tillers per plant was 0.62, and the yield per mu was 815.5 jin; with 40 jin of seeds per mu, there were 756 ears per square meter, the main ears accounted for 75.8%, the average number of grains per main ear was 27, the average number of ineffective tillers per plant was 0.46, and the yield per mu was 1,012.8 jin.

　　Surveys of rice in many regions have also shown that the number of grains in the main ears is greater than the number of grains in the tiller ears. The yield of those with more main ears and fewer tillers is higher than those with fewer main ears and more tillers.

　　However, in the case of highly dense planting, single plants that do not tiller at all may not necessarily grow well. Judging from the current growth of winter wheat in the ground, in wheat fields with similar total number of plants, the seedlings of single plants that do not tiller are generally taller, but weaker, and the lower leaves are yellow; the seedlings that tiller normally are generally shorter, but stronger, and the color is oily green. It can be seen that the robust growth of wheat may be related to its tillering characteristics, and simply relying on single plants that do not tiller may not be reliable.

　　Of course, if there are too many tillers, it will inevitably increase ineffective tillers, waste land, and be unfavorable to ventilation and light transmission. Some varieties tiller less to begin with, so they should be planted denser. Under some conditions (such as changes in temperature) that are unfavorable to crop tillering, they should also be planted denser.

　　Whether rice production relies on main ears or tillers is not only related to the number of holes planted per mu, but also to the number of seedlings per hole.

　　In the past, many places were accustomed to large plants (more seedlings per hole) and sparse planting; later, they promoted small plants (fewer seedlings per hole) and dense planting. These are all relying on more tillers to increase the total number of ears per unit area. In this way, if the climate is unfavorable to tillering, it is often difficult to ensure that there are enough ears; when there are many tillers, it is difficult to control ineffective tillers. Last year, under conditions of deep plowing and more fertilizer, many places switched to "medium plant dense planting", and yields increased greatly.

　　In Guangsixi County, Guangdong, double-cropping late rice was planted with 20,000 holes per mu with five seedlings per hole in 1957, with an average yield of more than 200 jin per mu. In 1958, close planting was done at 5x1 inches with four to six seedlings per hole, and with other measures, the yield per mu increased to about 2,000 jin. Some places used close planting at 6x3 inches with about ten seedlings per hole, and the yield was also relatively high.

　　Last year, the Fuling Production Team of the Xingzi Commune in Shuangfeng County, Hunan, had three paddy fields planted at 3x6 inches, and the other conditions were the same. Among them, one field had four or five seedlings per hole and yielded 823 jin per mu; one field had nine or ten seedlings per hole and yielded 1,358 jin per mu; and another field had twelve to fourteen seedlings per hole and yielded 1,000 jin per mu. This also shows that too many or too few seedlings per hole is not good.

　　How density and close planting methods are best? Many places have explored valuable experience. However, the significant increase in the degree of close planting and the significant increase in the area of close planting have only emerged in the past one or two years; its relationship with various aspects of the conditions is very intricate and complex. It cannot be assumed that we have uncovered all the secrets of close planting and increased production. However, as long as we rely on the strength and wisdom of the masses, and continuously experiment and improve, we will be able to more and more correctly and richly grasp the objective laws of close planting and increased production and the specific methods adapted to local conditions.

    关于密植
    植物有一种奇异的本领，能在太阳光下，把空气、土里的水分和简单的无机质养料变成复杂的有机物质——淀粉、糖、纤维、脂肪等。农作物除去水分以外的干物量，有90％到95％是有机物质。这些有机物质，十分之九是靠植物的这种奇异的本领造成的。这种本领就叫做“光合作用”。农作物产量的大小，就看通过“光合作用”产生的有机物质的多少。“光合作用”主要是靠叶子进行的。在叶子里把空气、水分、养料初步加工以后，再输送到别的地方去进一步加工。密植，就是为了尽可能增加能进行“光合作用”的叶子的总面积，以便最大限度地利用地里的水分、养分，地上的空气，太阳的光和热，制造最多的有机物质，使根、茎、叶，特别是果实、种子长得又多又快又大又好。
        太稀、太密都不好
    如果庄稼种得太稀，就会使可以利用的养料、水分、阳光、空气等等白白地浪费掉，就得不到最高的产量。
    如果庄稼种得太密，超过了一定的限度，就不能满足庄稼对养料、阳光等等的需要，就会使庄稼不能正常地生长，也得不到最高的产量。
    既要在单位面积上有最多的植株，又要使每一株都能充分地发挥“光合作用”，都是茁壮的、穗长穗大、粒多粒重的，才能达到高产。
    许多例子都可以说明：在一定条件下，在一定限度内，庄稼种得越密，产量越高；缺少一定条件，超过一定限度，产量又要降低。
    山东省农业科学研究所1958年作了夏玉米密植试验：在良好的水肥条件下，用中熟玉米品种，每亩分别种了六百六十六株到一万三千三百三十二株。其中以种植五千三百二十八株的产量最高。从每亩八千株的开始，密度越大，产量越低。每亩一万株以上的，比别的地多施不少肥料，产量仍然很低。
    安徽舒城县千人桥公社团结生产队，去年有二亩四分中稻是3×5寸密植，每亩收三千零五斤；这个队另有三亩同样品种同样条件的中稻，2×5寸密植，穗子抽齐后就全部倒伏，每亩只收六百一十斤。这个社的重阳生产队有一亩三分“南特号”早稻，3×6寸密植，每亩收四千七百四十二斤；同样品种、同样条件下，另有一块8×12寸稀植的早稻，每亩只收三百七十斤。据舒城各地的调查材料，当地去年密植3×5寸、3×6寸、4×6寸之间的产量最高。比这密的，分蘖少，易倒伏，瘪谷多，产量低；比这稀的，无效分蘖多，浪费地力和阳光，产量也低。
    福建南安县五星公社美山大队，去年许多山田都是每亩下三百多担土杂肥，都是采用
  “红米早”稻种，采用5×3寸密植的，比5×2寸的每亩多收一百来斤，比5×4寸的每亩多收五十多斤。社星大队5×2寸的山田，比1957年稀植是大大增产了，可是比5×3寸的每亩少收二百多斤。
    这个社的一位老农说：“多大的炮装多少药，保证这一炮打得最响最准”。这个比喻好得很。各丘田的具体情况不同，应该分丘确定不同的密度。
            突破了陈规
    太稀不好，太密也不好，究竟密到什么程度才好？这不能一概而论，要看条件如何而定。条件有两种，一种是人为的条件，像深耕、肥料、水利、工具、劳动力的多少和技术高低、领导强弱等等；一种是自然的条件，像气候、地质、土质、光照、作物本身的特性等等。一般地说，目前我国农业战线上人为条件是比几年前大大进步了，对自然条件的征服力和适应力也大大增加了。这样，密植的程度就可以比过去大大提高。
    以前，有些农业科学工作者没有全面地综合地系统地考查各种条件同密植的相互关系，而是在浅耕、少肥等条件下孤立地进行密植试验，因而做出了水稻每亩不能超过三万穴或三十万穗的错误结论，认为穗数多了每穗粒数就要减少，株数多了就要倒伏，产量都会降低。去年，在党的领导下，我国农民大大发挥了创造性、积极性，水稻密植的这个“极限”已经被突破了。
    据去年浙江十五丘亩产二千斤以上的丰产田统计：每亩有效穗数在七十万以上的有十二丘，一百万穗以上的有三丘。先进的农民并且以密植为中心，改革了一系列的栽培技术。有些人过去认为肥料上多了水稻就要倒伏，这也是在浅耕、稀植的条件下得到的结论；深耕密植以后，合理施肥量就大大突破了过去人们定下的“极限”。
    又据江苏省常熟县四十八块单季晚稻田调查结果：每亩二十五万穗左右的每穗平均六十七点零三粒；三十万穗的六十七点一七粒；三十五万穗的六十二点四六粒；七十万穗的五十九点八六粒。前两个密度相比，穗数增加五万
  （五分之一），而每穗粒数却并未减少；后两个密度相比，穗数增加一倍，而每穗粒数只减少二点六粒，即降低4.2％。
    小麦，过去许多人也认为密度超过每亩五十万穗就要倒伏，就要变得穗小粒少。可是，1958年许多亩产三千斤以上的高额丰产田，每亩都有一百万穗以上；这些麦田里的麦子，不但穗大、穗多、粒多、粒重，而且也没有倒伏。原因是土、肥、水、种等等增产措施和播种、管理的技术都大大提高了。
    别的作物也是这样。以大豆来说，从来认为种得稠了“坑死人”。这也是在过去浅耕少肥甚至无肥的条件下得出的结论。其实，在一定条件下和一定限度内，大豆增加了密度之后，每株的分枝数虽然会减少一些；但是，由于株数增多所增加的产量，却大大超过枝数减少的损失。
          看条件定密度
    密度怎样才好，要根据各地已有的经验，参照具体条件的变化来决定。同时，也要力求为密植创造更好的条件。
    江苏兴化县垛田乡的水稻试验田，一块每亩插了八万一千五百二十一穴，耕深八寸，根系分布达到二十四公分深、十二公分宽，亩产五千三百三十三斤。另一块每亩插了五万三千六百六十七穴，耕深五寸，根系分布约十五公分深，八公分宽，亩产一千二百零三斤。
    广西农业科学研究所柳州工作站，同一块试验田，一边亩插三十万苗，肥料足，收获时平均每穗九十七粒到一百二十三粒，亩产达到一千斤。另一边亩插五十万到八十万苗，苗多穗多，但缺肥，收获时每穗只有三十至四十七粒，亩产量也只一千斤多一些。
    福建南安县五星公社联盟大队，同样的密植田，用“三冬早”粳稻良种的，比用一般的“红米早”种子的，每亩多收一百八十四斤；平原地区同样条件的密植田，深翻一尺的比翻六寸的，每亩多收二百来斤。
    作物栽培期不同，密度也应该有所不同。早稻生育期短，发棵时气温不高，出穗时气温升高，抽穗早而快，种得稍密些，既可促使早熟，又可以在有些苗因天冷不分蘖的情况下提供后备的株数，使总株数不致过分减少。中稻特性近于早稻，但栽秧后正逢高温，发棵较早，容易封行，应该比早稻种得稀一些。晚稻栽插时气温更高，更容易发棵封行，又应该比中稻稀一些。
    在早、中、晚稻之中，品种不同，密度也应不同。早沙粳不如籼稻“南特号”容易发棵，可较密一些；中稻成熟早的“桂花球”，又可以比同一类型但成熟稍晚的“黄壳早”较密一些。
    同一品种，由于栽插时间先后不同，密度也要有所差别。如先栽的早稻，因气温不高，比后栽的早稻就可以密一些；相反，后栽的晚稻，因营养生长期不足，分蘖少、死亡率大，应该比先栽的晚稻密一些。
    既要力求使密度适应作物品种的特性，又要力求培育适合密植的品种。例如河北临漳县群众选育出来的“多桃棉”和江西彭泽县芙蓉农场选育出来的“芙蓉棉”，就都是茎高、枝短、桃多、根深的，适宜密植的新品种。
          改进种植方式
    在每亩株数相同的情况下，种植方式不同，产量也会有相当大的差别。
    改进种植方式的主要方法之一，是合理地调整株距和行距。一般地说，中耕作物（玉米、水稻、棉花等）应当以缩小株距为主，保持一定行距；非中耕作物（小麦等）要使植株尽可能分布均匀，并保证单株有一定的营养面积。不论哪种作物，在确定行距、株距的时候，都要考虑到通风、透光的需要和田间管理的方便；同时，也要考虑到作物的特性。
    沈阳农学院光辉农场试验证明，水稻长方形密植比正方形密植好，每亩用秧量相同，长方形密植的分蘖早，积累养分多。同为每亩十万苗的同一品种，6×6寸的每穗七十七点五七粒，亩产七百九十三点一斤；6×3寸的每穗七十九点四粒，亩产八百六十二点七斤。每亩三十万苗的，6×6寸的亩产八百二十六点九斤；6×3寸的亩产九百一十八点九斤。4×4寸，3×3寸的正方形密植，到了分蘖盛期田间就郁闭起来，通风透光不良，并且不利于田间管理，植株软弱，无效分蘖多。
    山东临清大新庄去年种的棉花，同是每亩四千四百四十四株，行距二尺的比行距一尺八寸的多产8.6％，比行距一尺五寸的多产18％。
    改进种植方式的另一种方法是合理间作。例如玉米、棉花等茎秆较高的作物，可以同马铃薯、豆类等茎秆较矮的或比较耐荫的作物间作。多行间作比单行间作效果更好。
    四川省正在推行玉米“定向培植”（使叶子整整齐齐地向同一方向生长），也是改进种植方式的一种。
        靠主穗？靠分蘖？
    穗数多，才可能多增产。怎样使穗数增多呢？对于有分蘖特性的作物来说，有两种不同的意见。有人主张依靠主穗，就是说：尽可能使一粒种子只长出一个单株，让这株作物吸收的养分集中在这个单株上，在这单株上长出大穗来；并且认为这样可以减少以至消灭无效分蘖，可以使穗子的成熟时间一致。另外有人主张依靠分蘖，就是说：可以不增加或少增加播种量，而用各种方法使每一株作物多分蘖，多出穗；并且认为这样才适合有分蘖特性的作物的本性。
    究竟哪一种意见是正确的呢？目前还不能完全作出定论。从一些情况着来，应以依靠主穗为主，同时也要有适当数目的有效分蘖。
    从去年青海省德令哈农场的春小麦的情况来看：每亩二十八斤种子的，每平方公尺四百七十四穗，主穗占52.1％，主穗平均粒数为二十六点九，平均每株无效分蘖数为零点六二，亩产量为八百一十五点五斤；每亩四十斤种子的，每平方公尺七百五十六穗，主穗占75.8％，主穗平均粒数为二十七，平均每株无效分蘖数为零点四六，亩产量为一千零一十二点八斤。
    许多地区对水稻所作的调查，也说明了主穗粒数比分蘖穗粒数多。主穗较多、分蘖较少的，比主穗较少、分蘖较多的产量高。
    但是，在高度密植的情况下，完全不分蘖的单株也不一定能生长得很好。从目前地里冬小麦的生长情况看来，在总株数相近的麦田里，不分蘖的单株的幼苗一般长得比较高，但比较纤弱，下部叶片发黄；正常进行分蘖的幼苗一般长得比较矮，但比较粗壮，颜色油绿。可见，小麦的健壮生长同它的分蘖的特性可能是有一定关系的，单纯依靠不分蘖的单株不一定靠得住。
    当然，如果分蘖太多，也势必会增多无效分蘖，浪费地力，也不利于通风透光。有些品种分蘖本来就比较少，应该种得较密些。在有些条件下（如气温发生变化）不利于作物分蘖，也要种得较密些。
    水稻增产靠主穗还是靠分蘖，不但同每亩插秧的穴数有关，还同每穴的本秧苗数有关。
    过去，许多地方习惯大株（每穴用秧苗较多）稀植；后来，又推广了小株（每穴用秧苗较少）密植。这都是依靠分蘖多来增加单位面积内的总穗数。这样，有时气候不利于分蘖，往往难以保证有足够的穗数；在分蘖多的时候，又难控制无效分蘖。去年，在深耕、多肥等条件下，许多地方改为“中株密植”，产量大增。
    广东广四县双季晚稻，1957年亩插二万穴，每穴五苗，平均亩产二百多斤。1958年，5×1寸密植，每穴四至六苗，加上其他措施，亩产增至二千斤左右。有些地方采用6×3寸密植，每穴十苗左右，产量也比较高。
    湖南双峰县杏子公社附铃生产队去年有三丘田都是插的3×6寸，其他条件也相同。其中一丘每穴四、五根苗，亩产八百二十三斤；一丘每穴九根、十根苗，亩产一千三百五十八斤；另一丘每穴十二根到十四根苗，亩产一千斤。这也说明，每穴苗数过多过少都不好。
    密度和密植方式究竟怎样好？许多地方已经摸索出来了很宝贵的经验。但是，密植程度的大大增加和密植面积的大大增加，都是近一两年才出现的事；它同各方面的条件的关系又是十分错综复杂的。不能认为，我们已经揭破了密植增产的全部秘密。但是，只要依靠群众的力量和智慧，不断地试验和改进，一定能越来越正确、越来越丰富地掌握密植增产的客观规律和因地制宜的具体方法。
