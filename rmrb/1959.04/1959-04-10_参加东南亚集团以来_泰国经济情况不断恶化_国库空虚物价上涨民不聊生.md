Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 9th Dispatch: Due to the Thai government's pursuit of the U.S.'s policy of arms expansion and war preparation and its neglect of developing the national economy, the country's economic situation is deteriorating daily. Thai Prime Minister Nai Sarit, in a statement to the press in February, said that what was giving him a headache at this time was the financial problem. Finance Minister Nai Chote Khunnakaem also admitted that Thailand's current financial and economic situation is very difficult, the national treasury is empty, prices are rising, and most people are living in extreme poverty.

Since joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Thailand has been following a policy of arms expansion and war preparation under the direction of the United States for many years. The substantial increase in military expenditure is the main reason for the country's financial difficulties. It is revealed that Thailand's armed forces, including the police, have expanded from approximately 160,000 in 1956 to more than 200,000 at present. The Thai government's direct or indirect expenditure on military affairs each year often accounts for about 50% of the total budget expenditure, resulting in alarming deficits in the annual budget. According to Thai official statistics, in the eight years up to last year, the total deficit in the government budget reached 9,561.1 million baht, with an average annual deficit of approximately 1.2 billion baht. The Thai government's method of making up for the deficit is to borrow money, increase taxes, and issue currency excessively. According to statistics, the Thai government's domestic and foreign debt has now reached more than 8 billion baht. Inflation and currency devaluation are making people's lives increasingly difficult.

Under the circumstances of the cruel plunder and exploitation of Thailand by imperialist countries headed by the United States, Thailand's national economy is shrinking day by day, and foreign trade has been in a disadvantageous position of huge import surpluses. According to statistics published by the Thai government, from 1953 to 1957, Thailand's import surplus in foreign trade totaled 3,607.7 million baht, with an average annual import surplus of 721.4 million baht.

The large-scale dumping of U.S. surplus agricultural products has seriously affected Thailand's rice exports. Currently, only 14 of the 80 large rice mills nationwide in Thailand are able to maintain production, and only 2,000 of the 3,000 small rice mills are actually operating. The "embargo" policy imposed on Thailand by the United States has caused Thailand huge losses. From 1951 to 1956, Thailand's rubber trade suffered losses of nearly 3 billion baht due to U.S. monopoly and price cuts.

Thailand's other important export commodity, tin, is also experiencing sharp declines in production and output. The textile and timber industries are also facing great difficulties. Three-quarters of the country's textile factories have declared bankruptcy.

With the Thai government signing the "Thai-U.S. Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement" and the "Thai-U.S. Military Assistance Agreement" with the United States in 1950, U.S. military "advisors" and various "experts" poured into Thailand's military, economic, and government departments, wantonly interfering in Thailand's internal affairs. People familiar with the Thai political situation point out that the frequent political turmoil in Thailand is closely related to U.S. interference.

After Thailand joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the United States also used the country as a base for aggression and subversion against neighboring countries. In order to realize this sinister attempt, the United States has built strategic highways, airports, and naval bases in Thailand, and transported rocket weapons into Thailand. This situation actually threatens Thailand's own security. At the same time, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, controlled by the United States, has also continuously held military exercises in Thailand, using them to threaten Southeast Asian countries and to intimidate the Thai people who are demanding that the country embark on the path of peace, independence, and democracy.

The broad masses of the Thai people have increasingly recognized the aggressive face of the United States. In the past two years, the Thai people have continuously demanded the immediate withdrawal from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the abolition of the unequal treaties signed with the United States, the pursuit of a peaceful and neutral policy, and the establishment of friendly relations with all countries. Thai social opinion has repeatedly pointed out that only by getting rid of U.S. control and pursuing an independent and autonomous policy can Thailand eliminate the current economic and political crisis.

### 参加东南亚集团以来  泰国经济情况不断恶化  国库空虚物价上涨民不聊生

    参加东南亚集团以来
    泰国经济情况不断恶化
    国库空虚物价上涨民不聊生
    新华社9日讯　曼谷消息：由于泰国政府追随美国执行扩军备战政策和忽视发展民族经济，这个国家的经济情况正在日益恶化。泰国总理乃沙立在2月间向报界发表谈话时说，这个时期使他感到非常头痛的是财政问题。财政部长乃触·坤那格森也曾经承认，目前泰国的财政和经济情况十分困难，国库空虚，物价上涨，大多数人民生活非常困苦。
    泰国自从加入东南亚条约组织以后，多年来一直在美国指使下奉行扩军备战的政策。军费开支的大量增加是造成这个国家财政困难的主要原因。据透露，泰国的武装部队包括警察在内，已经从1956年的约十六万人扩充到目前的二十多万人。泰国政府每年直接或间接用于军事方面的开支往往要占整个预算支出的50％左右，从而使得每年的预算出现惊人的赤字。据泰国官方统计，到去年为止的八年间，在政府预算中出现的赤字共达九十五亿六千一百多万铢，平均每年出现赤字约十二亿铢。泰国政府弥补赤字的办法就是借债、加重税收和滥发通货。据统计，泰国政府的国内外债务目前已经达到八十多亿铢。通货膨胀和货币贬值使得人民生活日益困难。
    在以美国为首的帝国主义国家对泰国推行残酷的掠夺和剥削政策的情况下，泰国的民族经济日益萎缩，对外贸易一直处于巨额入超的不利地位。据泰国政府发表的统计数字，从1953年到1957年，泰国对外贸易的入超额共达三十六亿零七百多万铢，平均每年入超七亿二千一百多万铢。
    美国剩余农产品的大量倾销，严重影响了泰国的大米出口。目前，在泰国全国的八十家大碾米厂中，只有十四家能够维持生产，在三千家小型碾米厂中，实际开工的只有二千家。而美国强加在泰国头上的“禁运”政策，更使泰国蒙受了巨大损失。从1951年到1956年，泰国的橡胶贸易由于美国垄断、压价而遭受的损失将近三十亿铢。
    泰国的另一种重要出口物资——锡的产量和输出量也都在锐减。纺织业和锯木业也遭到极大困难。这个国家的纺织厂已有四分之三宣告倒闭。
    随着泰国政府在1950年同美国签订了“泰美经济技术援助协定”和“泰美军事援助协定”，美国的军事“顾问”和各种各样的“专家”就蜂涌侵入泰国的军事、经济和政府部门，肆无忌惮地进行干预泰国内政的活动。熟悉泰国政情的人士指出，泰国政局的经常发生动荡同美国的干涉有密切联系。
    在泰国参加了东南亚条约组织以后，美国还把这个国家作为侵略和颠复邻近国家的基地。为了实现这种罪恶企图，美国在泰国修建了战略公路、飞机场和海军基地，并且把火箭武器运入泰国。这种情况实际上为泰国本身的安全带来威胁。与此同时，由美国控制的东南亚条约组织还不断在泰国举行军事演习，借以威胁东南亚国家，并且恫吓要求使国家走上和平、独立和民主的道路的泰国人民。
    泰国广大人民已经日益认清美国的侵略面目。最近两年来，泰国人民不断要求立即退出东南亚条约组织，废除同美国签订的不平等条约，奉行和平中立政策，同一切国家建立友好关系。泰国社会舆论一再指出，只有摆脱美国的控制，推行独立自主的政策，泰国才能消除目前的经济和政治危机。
