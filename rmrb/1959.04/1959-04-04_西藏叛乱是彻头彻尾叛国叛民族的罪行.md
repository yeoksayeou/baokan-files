The majority of the Kalons of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, colluding with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, have outrageously and publicly torn up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and launched an armed rebellion, which is extremely infuriating. This is entirely against the will of the Tibetan people, obstructing and undermining the consistent efforts of the Central People's Government to thoroughly realize the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and a conspiracy to split and undermine national unity. It is a serious crime of thoroughly betraying the motherland and the interests of the nation. It has aroused great anger among the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country, who have unanimously condemned it, and therefore it will inevitably be spurned by the people.

The Tibetan rebellion is a planned, organized, and long-premeditated rebellion against the Central People's Government and against socialism. Imperialists and foreign reactionaries, as well as the rebels, have wantonly slandered and spread rumors, reversed black and white, and deceived the masses, saying that the People's Liberation Army's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is "destroying religious and political autonomy." The rebels claim that they are protecting "national interests" and "protecting religion." This statement is a complete distortion of facts, confusing right and wrong, and misleading the masses. We must distinguish between right and wrong, recognize good and evil, and see through and shatter the enemy's conspiracy.

We know that this Tibetan rebellion has a long history. For a long time, the Tibetan rebels have gathered bandits, roamed around, disrupted transportation, robbed merchants and travelers, raped and killed, and harmed the people. The Central Government has long adopted a policy of patient waiting and leniency, prioritizing the unity of the motherland and national unity, doing its utmost, repeatedly advising and expecting them to repent and start anew. However, they have been ungrateful and, with the support of imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, have split the unity of the motherland, undermined national unity, and engaged in armed rebellion. The occurrence of the Tibetan rebellion is by no means accidental. The enemy has consistently tried every means to prevent the Tibetan people from gradually moving towards a prosperous and happy socialist society through democratic reforms, and to prevent the Tibetan people from living a happy life.

From the reactionary slogans put forward by the rebels, they openly proposed "Tibetan independence" and "drive out the Han people," which has very bluntly exposed their hideous faces. The rebels attempted to make the Tibetan people lose the care and help of the Central People's Government, the great leader Chairman Mao, and the Han people, and to make the Tibetan region get rid of the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, so that the Tibetan people would forever be in a state of being enslaved and insulted, and make the Tibetan people leave the big family of the motherland, and offer Tibet to the imperialists. From these, we can clearly see their ambition and serious crime of betraying the motherland.

The rebels launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa and the central government agencies, and the Tibetan people were not spared either. The rebels killed Kanqiong Soinam Drazin, a Tibetan official of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibetan Autonomous Region who opposed the rebellion, and wounded Sangpo Tenzin Dhondup, the Tibetan deputy commander of the Tibet Military Region, and others, endangering the Dalai Lama under the pretext of protecting his safety. During the rebellion, they carried out arson, killing, robbery, and looting against the people of all ethnic groups in Lhasa. All this is sufficient to fully illustrate the enemy's deep-seated hatred for the Central People's Government and for all ethnic groups. Can it be said that this inhuman behavior is in the interests of the broad masses of monks and laypeople? Is it in the national interest? No, it is completely against the interests of the nation. Therefore, this is by no means a national issue.

Protecting freedom of religious belief is stipulated in the Constitution. In fact, for many years, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet have always strictly observed discipline, respected local religious beliefs and customs, and did not take a single needle or thread from the masses, and were warmly loved by the Tibetan people. These facts were witnessed by me when I went to Tibet in 1956. However, while the state protects freedom of religious belief, religious believers must also love the country and abide by the law. As early as in the report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Liu Shaoqi clearly pointed out: "Our country will, as in the past, effectively guarantee citizens' right to freedom of religious belief, but guaranteeing freedom of religious belief and guaranteeing freedom of counter-revolutionary activities are absolutely two different things. Our constitution and all laws will never allow those who carry out counter-revolutionary activities under the cloak of religion to get any convenience." The Tibetan rebels kidnapped the Dalai Lama, killed and insulted monks and nuns. Is this "protecting religion"? Their treasonous behavior not only violates the Constitution and laws, but also completely violates Buddhist precepts, and they are wolves in Buddhist clothing. Buddhist teachings teach monks to be pure, self-disciplined, patriotic, and law-abiding. The Tibetan rebels actually betrayed the country, violated the law, and violated the teachings.

The Central People's Government has consistently adhered to the policy of national unity, national equality, gradually realizing national regional autonomy, and gradually realizing democratic reforms in Tibet. However, the reactionary group in Tibet fundamentally does not want regional autonomy, openly engages in rebellion, and attempts to plot "Tibetan independence" and organize illegal so-called "people's meetings." Facts have proved that only under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government can there be true regional autonomy and a bright future. We Tibetan people, like other fraternal ethnic groups, have the ideal of building socialism and communism and living a happy life, but without the unity of the motherland, it is simply impossible. Take our Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture as an example. Before liberation, we suffered the pain of national oppression for a long time, and the Tibetan people lived a life worse than cattle and horses. At that time, the reactionary rulers took various cruel measures to try to eliminate us. Our Tibetan people were not treated as human beings during the reactionary rule, and the economy and culture were very backward. Since liberation, our Gannan Tibetan people have truly seen the light of day after clearing away the clouds. Under the light of the central government's ethnic policy, our Tibetan people are as equal, free, and closely united as all fraternal ethnic groups. In 1953, national regional autonomy was established in Gannan, realizing the right of our own nation to be masters of its own affairs. For more than nine years since liberation, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, we have fully exercised our autonomous rights, and the economic and cultural undertakings in the Gannan region have been unprecedentedly developed, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved. Especially under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for building socialism, last year, after the anti-feudal struggle, we swept away the feudal oppression and exploitation system with overwhelming force, paving the way for socialist development. We are entering a new historical period of people's communes with a speed of one day equals twenty years and with a heroic revolutionary pace, crossing several eras. The Gannan Tibetan people have completely got rid of feudal oppression, the class consciousness has been unprecedentedly improved, and the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of working farmers and herdsmen has been fundamentally changed. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the autonomous prefecture's various economic and cultural construction undertakings have been unprecedentedly developed in the past few years, and a scene of prosperity is everywhere. As of the end of 1958, Gannan, which had no modern factories before, has now built more than 19,500 industrial units, and the output value has increased by 13.4 times compared with 1957. Steel overfulfilled the original production plan by 225%, and pig iron overfulfilled by 192%. Grain has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output of the entire autonomous prefecture reached more than 320 million catties, an increase of more than 80% compared with 1957, turning the former grain-deficient area into a surplus area. Animal husbandry, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings have also been greatly developed. In the past, the vast majority of Tibetan working people were poorly clothed and fed, but now they are well-fed and clothed. From my personal experience before and after liberation, I deeply realize that listening to Chairman Mao and following the Communist Party will always bring happiness. What we need is to develop production and construction, live and work in peace and contentment, and absolutely not to destroy production and construction and disrupt social order; what we need is revolutionary progress, and absolutely not counter-revolutionary retrogression. Years of practice have proved a truth: only under the unified leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao can all ethnic minorities have a bright and unlimited future.

The rebellion of the Tibetan reactionaries will definitely fail completely and be quelled. The Tibetan people will establish a stable order and realize regional autonomy. The future of the Tibetan people is bright and promising. I believe that under the unified leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao, the Tibetan people will, together with the people of the whole country, strive to build a prosperous and happy socialist new Tibet.

    西藏叛乱是彻头彻尾叛国叛民族的罪行
    甘肃省副省长  甘南藏族自治州州长  黄正清
    西藏地方政府的多数噶伦和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，竟丧尽天良公然撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，劫持达赖喇嘛，发动武装叛乱，使人万分愤慨。这完全是违背西藏人民的意愿，阻挠和破坏中央人民政府的一贯为彻底实现和平解放西藏所作的努力，分裂与破坏民族团结的阴谋活动，是彻头彻尾背叛祖国背叛本民族利益的严重罪行。它引起了西藏人民以及全国人民的极大愤怒，同声声讨与谴责，因此也必然被人民所唾弃。
    西藏叛乱是有计划、有组织、蓄谋已久的反对中央人民政府、反对社会主义的叛乱。帝国主义和外国反动派以及叛乱分子，大肆污蔑造谣，颠倒黑白，欺骗群众，说人民解放军平定西藏叛乱是什么“摧毁宗教和政治自治”。叛乱分子自称他们自己是保护“民族利益”“保护宗教”的人。这种说法，完全是歪曲事实，混淆是非，迷惑群众，我们必须分辨大是大非，认清善恶，识破与粉碎敌人的阴谋。
    我们知道，这次西藏叛乱由来已久。长期以来，西藏的叛乱分子即纠集匪徒，窜扰各地，破坏交通，劫掳商旅，奸淫烧杀，残害人民。中央长期来采取了耐心等待和宽大为怀的政策，以祖国的统一为重，以民族团结为重，仁至义尽，再三忠告并期待他们悔过自新，悬崖勒马。但是，他们却忘恩负义，在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的支持下，分裂祖国的统一，破坏民族团结，进行武装叛乱。西藏叛乱的发生，绝不是偶然的，敌人一贯来千方百计地阻挠西藏人民经过民主改革逐步走向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，不让西藏人民过美满幸福的生活。
    从叛乱分子所提出的反动口号来说，他们公开提出“西藏独立”、“赶走汉人”，这已十分露骨地暴露出他们的狰狞面目。叛乱分子企图使藏族人民失去中央人民政府、伟大的领袖毛主席和汉族人民的关怀和帮助，妄图使西藏地区摆脱中央人民政府的统一领导，使藏族人民永远处于被奴役被侮辱的地位，使西藏人民脱离祖国的大家庭，并且把西藏奉送给帝国主义。这些，显然可以看出他们的野心与背叛祖国的严重罪行。
    叛乱分子向人民解放军驻拉萨部队和中央机关全面进攻，藏族人民也不能幸免。叛乱分子打死反对叛乱的西藏自治区筹备委员会藏族官员堪穷索朗降措，打伤西藏军区藏族副司令员桑颇·才旺仁增等人，借口保护达赖喇嘛的安全而进行着危害他的活动。在叛乱期间，他们对拉萨各族人民进行烧杀抢劫。这一切，足以充分说明敌人对中央人民政府对各族人民的刻骨仇恨。难道说这种惨无人道的行为是符合广大僧俗人民的利益吗？是合乎民族利益吗？不是的，完全违背本民族的利益。因此，这绝不是什么民族问题。
    保护宗教信仰自由，这是宪法所规定了的。实际上，多年来进驻西藏的人民解放军部队，一贯严守纪律，尊重当地宗教信仰和风俗习惯，不拿群众一针一线，受到西藏人民群众的热诚爱戴。这些事实，我1956年去西藏是亲眼见到的。但是国家保护宗教信仰自由，而宗教信徒也必须爱国守法。刘少奇委员长早在关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告中即已明确指出：“我们的国家将如同过去一样切实地保障公民有宗教信仰自由的权利，但是，保障宗教信仰自由和保障反革命活动自由，是绝对不能混同的两件事，我们的宪法和一切法律同样是永远不会让那些披着宗教外衣进行反革命活动的分子得到一点方便的。”西藏叛乱分子劫持达赖喇嘛，杀害和侮辱僧尼，这难道是在“保护宗教”吗？他们的叛国行为不仅违反了宪法和法律，而且也完全违反佛教教规，是披着佛教外衣的豺狼。佛教教义教导僧众应当清戒修持爱国守法。西藏叛乱分子竟叛国违法，违背教义。
    中央人民政府对于西藏一贯地坚持祖国统一、民族团结、民族平等，逐步实现民族区域自治，逐步实现民主改革的政策。但是西藏的反动集团根本不要区域自治，公开进行叛乱，妄图策划“西藏独立”，组织非法的所谓“人民会议”。事实证明：只有在中央人民政府统一领导之下，才可能有真正的区域自治，才可能有光明的前途。我们藏族人民和其他各兄弟民族人民一样，有着建设社会主义和共产主义，过美满幸福生活的理想，但是没有祖国的统一，是根本不可能的。就拿我们甘南藏族自治州来说吧，解放前长期遭受民族压迫的痛苦，藏族人民过着不如牛马的生活，当时反动统治者采取种种残酷手段，企图消灭我们。我们藏族人民在反动统治时期是不被当作人看待的，经济、文化都很落后。解放以来，我们甘南藏族人民真算是拨开乌云见青天，在中央的民族政策照耀下，我们藏族同各兄弟民族一样平等自由，亲密团结。1953年在甘南建立了民族区域自治，实现了本民族当家作主的权利。解放九年多来，在中央人民政府领导下，充分行使了自治权，甘南地区的经济、文化事业得到了空前发展，各族人民生活得到了显著的改善。特别是在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，去年经过反封建斗争，以排山倒海之势，横扫了封建压迫和剥削制度，铺平了向社会主义发展的道路。又以一天等于二十年的速度，以豪迈的革命步伐，跨越几个时代，进入到人民公社化的新的历史时期。甘南藏族人民彻底摆脱了封建压迫，阶级觉悟空前提高，广大劳动农牧民的精神面貌根本改观。在中央人民政府的领导下，几年来自治州各项经济文化建设事业得到空前发展，到处呈现着一片繁荣的景象。截至1958年底为止，从前没有一座现代化工厂的甘南，现在已建起一万九千五百多个工业单位，产值比1957年增长十三点四倍，钢超额225％、生铁超额192％完成原订生产计划。粮食获得空前丰收，全自治州粮食总产量达到三亿二千多万斤，比1957年增产80％以上，使过去的缺粮区变为余粮区。畜牧业、交通运输业和文教事业也都有巨大发展。广大藏族劳动人民过去穿不暖吃不饱，现在是丰衣足食。我从解放前后的亲身经历中，深深体会到，听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，就永远是幸福。我们需要的是发展生产建设，安居乐业，绝不是破坏生产建设，破坏社会秩序；我们需要的是革命的前进，绝不是反革命的倒退。多年来的实践，证明了一条真理：只有在中央和毛主席的统一领导下，各少数民族才有光明无限的前途。
    西藏反动分子的叛乱定会彻底失败和平息。西藏人民将建立起安定的秩序，实现区域自治。藏族人民的前途是光明远大的。我相信，在中央和毛主席的统一领导下，西藏人民将和全国人民一起，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。　　　（新华社兰州3日电）
