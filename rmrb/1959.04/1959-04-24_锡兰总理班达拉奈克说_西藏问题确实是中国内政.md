Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, April 22nd: Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike said in Parliament tonight that the Tibet issue is indeed China's internal affair.

Prime Minister Bandaranaike made the remarks on the Tibet issue in response to a question raised by N.M. Perera.

After tracing the history of China's sovereignty over Tibet, Bandaranaike said, "There is no question that Tibet has always been considered a part of China. Even India recognized this after independence. Moreover, India also recognized this status of Tibet."

Bandaranaike pointed out that the Chinese government established the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1956, with the Dalai Lama as its chairman, in order to develop Tibet economically, politically, and culturally. He said that after that, the rebellion broke out.

He said he could not judge the reasons for the rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet. Was it because certain feudal interest groups or vested interest groups in Tibet were infringed upon and supported the anti-government rebellion, or was it because the government did not abide by the terms of the agreement, as stated in the Dalai Lama's statement? He said that even after reading the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," he still could not make a judgment on this issue. He said, "We do not know what caused the breakdown of the agreement." But he affirmed, "This is purely China's internal affair."

When talking about the Dalai Lama being abducted to India, Bandaranaike said that some Buddhists and others in Ceylon felt uneasy about "such a sacred person like the Dalai Lama" having to "seek refuge" in another country. But he said, "Did the Chinese government, as the Dalai Lama said, overstep its authority, or did they not in fact overstep their authority? This is a question." He also said that Ceylon naturally does not want anyone to suffer. He believes that the people of Asia and the world certainly hope that this issue will reach some kind of satisfactory solution. According to this solution, the Chinese continue to exercise suzerainty while allowing the Tibetan people to follow their way of life.

The Prime Minister of Ceylon also expressed that if Ceylon could offer any mediation with its small strength to achieve a satisfactory solution or promote understanding among the people of Asia and the world, it is very willing to do so at any time.

### 锡兰总理班达拉奈克说  西藏问题确实是中国内政

    锡兰总理班达拉奈克说
    西藏问题确实是中国内政
    新华社科伦坡22日电　锡兰总理班达拉奈克今晚在议会说，西藏问题确实是中国的内政问题。
    班达拉奈克总理是在答复纳·麦·佩雷拉提出的问题时发表关于西藏问题的谈话的。
    班达拉奈克追溯了中国对西藏的主权的历史后说，“毫无问题，西藏一直被认为是中国的一部分。印度甚至在独立以后也承认这一点。而且，印度还承认了西藏所处的这种地位。”
    班达拉奈克指出，中国政府在1956年成立了以达赖喇嘛为主任委员的西藏自治区筹备委员会，以便在经济上、政治上和文化上发展西藏。他说，之后，叛乱就爆发了。
    他说他对于西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱的原因究竟是由于西藏某些封建利益集团或既得利益集团受到侵犯而支持发动反政府叛乱的分子呢，还是如达赖喇嘛声明所说的是政府不遵守协议条款？他说，即使在看了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”以后，他仍然不能对这个问题作出判断。他说，“我们不知道协议是由于什么问题而破裂的。”但是他肯定说，“这纯粹是中国的内政问题。”
    在谈到达赖喇嘛被劫往印度一事的时候，班达拉奈克说，锡兰有些佛教徒和其他的人对于“像达赖喇嘛这样一个神圣的人”不得不到别的国家“谋求避难”而感到不安。但是他说，“中国政府有没有像达赖喇嘛所说的，超越了权力，或者，事实上他们并没有越权呢？这是一个问题。”他还说，锡兰自然不希望任何人受苦。他认为，亚洲和全世界人民当然希望，这个问题会达成某种圆满的解决办法。根据这种解决办法，中国人继续行使宗主权而让西藏人民遵循他们的生活方式。
    锡兰总理还表示，如果锡兰能够以微小的力量提供它所能够提供的任何斡旋，来实现圆满的解决或增进亚洲和全世界人的谅解，它十分愿意在任何时候这样做。
