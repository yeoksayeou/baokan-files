　　The Struggle of the Colombian People
　　By Joaquín Moreno, Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Colombia

　　Colombia is located in South America, bordering the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It has a population of over thirteen million and a territory of over 1.13 million square kilometers, with fertile land and abundant mineral resources. Colombia has many large waterfalls, and the navigable Magdalena River runs through the fields of the motherland, connecting the central areas of the country with the Atlantic Ocean. The geographical and climatic conditions are suitable for the production of various fruits, vegetables, and grains, and parts of the plains are used as extensive pastures. Colombia is an extremely wealthy country, but its people live in great poverty.

　　Like other American countries, Colombia suffers from the domination of American big capital in its economy, resulting in its political situation being subjected to the trite rhetoric of "people's capitalism" and the American system of so-called "free enterprise," and the people's democratic freedoms are greatly deprived.

　　Colombia's economy relies primarily on coffee. Coffee is the main export product, and the United States is the main, almost the only, buyer. Colombia ranks second in the world in coffee production and first in quality. However, the price of Colombian coffee set by American buyers is extremely low. Two years ago, the price of coffee in the United States was $0.90 per pound, but now it has fallen to $0.42 per pound.

　　As the United States reduces its coffee purchases, the price of Colombian coffee falls accordingly, resulting in a surplus of coffee production. This creates a rather disturbing economic situation: consumer goods are becoming increasingly expensive, while wages remain stagnant, and the people's purchasing power is constantly declining.

　　As a result, the Colombian currency has also greatly devalued. Today, one peso (one hundred cents) can only buy what was worth twenty-seven cents five years ago. Three years ago, one US dollar was worth 2.5 Colombian pesos; today, one US dollar is worth more than 8 pesos. While the prices of Colombian exports to the United States have fallen, the prices of American products that Colombia must import have greatly increased. Something that could be bought for 2.5 pesos three years ago must now be bought for more than 8 pesos, but employees and workers still receive the same amount of pesos as they did three years ago. This shows that the increase in salaries and wages in Colombia has not only not kept pace with the rise in consumer goods, but in many cases, salaries and wages have even decreased. In addition to coffee, the main product of the national economy, American imperialism also exploits our country's other wealth. Colombian oil is controlled by several American companies belonging to Mobil Oil Corporation; the profits from oil extraction do not go to Colombians but to American capitalists. Furthermore, gold, manganese, mercury, and other minerals are also operated by Americans. Through agreements that are one-sidedly beneficial to it, the United States almost seizes all the products produced by Colombian workers in our motherland.

　　American imperialists dominate Colombia not only politically and economically but also culturally through vulgar magazines, color pictures, and movies. American imperialists spread their "American way of life." The main plots of American movies shown in our country involve unscrupulous bank robberies and the abduction of women; the games children play in parks also reflect the adverse effects of war propaganda on children, and the "heroic deeds" of thugs become entertainment in the innocent games of young people.

　　The above is merely a rough description of imperialism's rule in Colombia. To achieve its goal of dominating Colombia, imperialism has found support from pro-imperialist forces in Colombia, who shamelessly betray their country and unconditionally serve imperialism.

　　In the past, the Colombian government was ruled by feudal reactionary forces, which unconditionally succumbed to imperialism and reactionaries. After ten years of brutal dictatorial rule, the bourgeoisie seized power. This was the first time the Colombian bourgeoisie directly controlled the state apparatus.

　　Over the past thirty years, Colombia's industry, especially the textile and sugar industries, has made great progress. Despite the fact that American imperialists have refused to sell machinery and provide technicians, and have created various difficulties for us, the Paz del Río steel plant has still been built.

　　The development of the processing industry has led to the emergence of an industrial proletariat in our country. Before 1949, Colombia had a strong unified trade union movement, mainly organized and led by communists, which strived to achieve various important demands for workers and the general population. The bourgeois leaders were frightened by the surge of the trade union movement. Under the direction of imperialists and the heads of the Catholic Church's "Jesuits," they carried out a serious campaign to split the trade unions, using every means from persecution to bribery to achieve their goal of division and almost eliminate independent workers' organizations.

　　Urban trade union organizations were brutally destroyed by the terrible dictatorial rule, while at the same time the peasants carried out heroic armed resistance. Guerrilla units were formed by the peasants themselves. The guerrilla movement grew stronger and stronger, and the dictatorial regime was unable to suppress the brave guerrillas. The peasant guerrilla armed forces made a significant contribution to the overthrow of the dictator Rojas Pinilla.

　　After ten years of tyrannical rule that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Colombians, the dictatorship was finally overthrown by a broad movement formed by public opinion. From right-wing bourgeois Catholics to communists, and non-party people in urban and rural areas, all supported each other to oppose the dictatorship and drive away the former military dictator.

　　In the face of the widespread development of popular revolutionary forces, the bourgeoisie tried to block the development of new left-wing political forces. The ruling bourgeoisie forcibly implemented constitutional reforms through a referendum, dividing the state apparatus equally between the two bourgeois parties. They attempted to use this method to "legally" prevent the Communist Party and other democratic political forces from electing their spokespersons to the parliamentary bodies. Currently, we communists can vote, but people cannot vote for us communists.

　　The bourgeoisie wants to forcibly implement this anti-democratic system for twelve or sixteen years. However, the two-party system has already begun to encounter serious obstacles, and such an attempt will certainly not succeed. The democratic movement is growing; the working class is rebuilding their trade union organizations, and the unity of the proletariat is taking shape. The peasants keep their weapons safe, and the guerrillas transform into trade union organizations to legally advance their struggle.

　　The peasants are fighting for land, and in some places they have in fact seized land, forcing landlords and the government to distribute some estate lands. Workers and people in the cities oppose the high cost of living and have held several demonstrations against rising transportation costs. Students have taken their positions in the struggle, protesting high prices and low wages together with the people.

　　After ten years of underground life, the Communist Party, although still subject to various restrictions, such as not being able to elect its representatives to the parliamentary bodies, has gained legal status. In the past, it was a party that waged a resolute struggle under dictatorial rule, so today it enjoys high prestige among the masses of the people. Anti-communism is unpopular because it was the banner used by past reactionary dictators to persecute all patriots.

　　The Communist Party's Eighth National Congress, held last December, summarized the party's work during the difficult years of the repression period; revised the Party Constitution to bring it into line with today's conditions; formulated a strategic line based on the domestic political situation; adopted a program declaration; and, on the basis of the rich experience of underground struggle, advanced the organizational, ideological, and political construction. The experience of fraternal parties in various countries, especially the fraternal parties in the socialist camp, is of great help to us. The experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China is an extremely powerful and valuable contribution to the training of our communist parties in Latin America.

　　The struggle for democratic freedoms and national independence is the central political task of the Colombian communists. To achieve this goal, there must be a strong Communist Party; therefore, the main task set by the Party's Eighth National Congress is to build the party nationwide to advance the great tasks of the anti-imperialist and land revolution.

　　In its policy, the Communist Party has put forward the slogan of a national democratic front to oppose the remnants of dictatorial rule and any subversive coup plots against the current government (which the party recognizes as a legitimate constitutional government), because the forces attempting to overthrow the current government are the most reactionary forces of the overthrown dictatorial rule, who want to rebuild an anti-people reign of terror.

　　There is no doubt that the Colombian people, led by workers and peasants, with the growing progressive forces and the Communist Party, know how to liberate the country from the oppression of American imperialism and national traitors. Every victory of the socialist camp is a blow to imperialism and also a support for the struggles of the peoples of Latin American countries. Therefore, we say that the peoples of Latin American countries are fighting against a common enemy together with the peoples of other countries in the world.

　　哥伦比亚人民的斗争
　　哥伦比亚共产党政治局委员  侯阿金·毛列诺
    哥伦比亚位于南美洲，濒临太平洋和大西洋。人口一千三百多万人，领土一百一十三万多平方公里，土地肥沃，矿藏丰富。哥伦比亚有许多大瀑布，通航的马格达雷纳河纵贯祖国的原野，把国内的中心地区和大西洋联接起来。地理和气候条件适宜于生产各种水果、蔬菜和粮食，部分的平原地区用作粗放的牧场。哥伦比亚是一个极其富庶的国家，但人民的生活非常贫困。
    哥伦比亚和其他美洲国家一样，在经济上遭受着美国大资本的统治，结果在政治上也处在“人民资本主义”的滥调和所谓“自由企业”的美国制度的统治之下，人民的民主自由被大大地剥夺了。
    哥伦比亚的经济基本上是依靠咖啡。咖啡是主要的出口产品，美国是主要的、几乎是唯一的买主。哥伦比亚的咖啡在产量上占世界第二位，而质量则占第一位。但是美国买主所规定的哥伦比亚咖啡价格却极为便宜。两年前在美国的咖啡价格每磅零点九美元，现在却下降到零点四二美元了。
    随着美国对咖啡购买量的缩减，哥伦比亚咖啡的价格因之下跌，结果形成了咖啡的生产过剩。这就造成了一种相当令人不安的经济状况：消费品日益昂贵，工资却保持不动，人民的购买力不断下降。
    哥伦比亚的货币也因此大大贬值，今天一个比索（一百分）只能买到五年前值二十七分钱的东西。三年以前，一美元值二点五哥伦比亚比索，今天一美元值八比索以上。哥伦比亚输出品在美国跌价的同时，哥伦比亚必须进口的美国产品却大大涨价。三年以前只要二点五比索就能买到的东西，今天必须用八比索多才能买到，但是，职员和工人现在仍然领取与三年前同样多的比索。这说明了哥伦比亚的薪金和工资的增加不但没有跟消费品上涨成正比例，而且在许多场合里薪金和工资都下降了。除了国民经济中的主要产品咖啡以外，美帝国主义还榨取我国的其他财富。哥伦比亚石油掌握在美孚油公司的几家美国公司手中；开采石油所得的收益不归哥伦比亚人，而归美国资本家，此外，金、锰、水银以及其他矿物也都由美国人经营。美国通过对它片面有利的协定，几乎把哥伦比亚工人们在我们祖国生产的全部产品攫走。
    美帝国主义者不只在政治上和经济上，而且通过下流杂志、彩色图片和电影在文化生活上统治着哥伦比亚。美帝国主义者传播他们的“美国生活方式”。在我国放映的美国电影的主要情节是肆无忌惮地抢劫银行和诱拐女人；儿童在公园里进行的游戏也反映了战争宣传对儿童的恶劣影响，暴徒们的“英雄事迹”成了青年人天真游戏中的娱乐。
    以上情况仅仅是帝国主义在哥伦比亚进行统治的一个粗略叙述，帝国主义为了达到统治哥伦比亚的目的。寻找到了哥伦比亚亲帝国主义势力的支持，这些人无耻地背叛了自己的国家，无条件地为帝国主义效劳。
    过去哥伦比亚政府受封建反动势力的统治，这些势力无条件地向帝国主义和反动派屈服。经历了十年的残暴独裁统治以后，资产阶级掌握了政权。这是哥伦比亚资产阶级第一次直接控制国家机器。
    近三十年来，哥伦比亚的工业，特别是纺织工业和制糖工业得到了很大的发展。尽管美帝国主义者拒绝出售机器和提供技术人员，并且给我们制造了各种困难，但巴斯·德尔·里奥的炼钢厂还是建设起来了。
    加工工业的发展使我国出现了工业无产阶级。1949年以前，哥伦比亚有过主要由共产党人组织和领导的强大的统一工会运动，并且争取实现了工人和一般人民的各种重要的要求。资产阶级的领袖们被工会斗争的高涨吓坏了，他们在帝国主义者和天主教会“耶稣会”首脑分子的指使下，曾经进行了一次严重的分裂工会运动的活动，他们使尽了从迫害到贿赂的各种办法，达到了分裂的目的，并且几乎消灭了工人的独立组织。
    城市里的工会组织被恐怖的独裁统治野蛮地破坏了，而同时农民进行了英勇的武装抵抗。游击队是农民自己组成的。游击运动日益壮大起来，而独裁统治无力镇压勇敢的游击队员。农民的游击武装力量对推翻独裁者罗哈斯·皮尼亚作出了巨大的贡献。
    在使哥伦比亚人民成千上万地丧失生命的十年恐怖暴政统治之后，独裁统治终于被由公众舆论所形成的广泛运动所推翻。从右翼的资产阶级天主教徒，直到共产党人、城乡无党无派人士，都互相支援来反对独裁统治，并赶跑了过去的军事独裁者。
    在人民革命力量广泛发展的面前，资产阶级力图阻挡新的左翼政治力量的发展。当政的资产阶级通过公民投票，强制施行了宪法改革，把国家机器由两个资产阶级政党平分。他们企图用这样的办法达到“合法”地阻止共产党和其他民主政治力量把自己的发言人选到议会机构里去的目的。目前我们共产党人可以投票选举，但是人们不能投我们共产党人的票。
    资产阶级想把这个反民主的制度强制施行十二年或十六年。但是两党制的政体已经开始遇到严重的障碍了，而且这样的企图也一定不会实现的，民主运动正在增长；工人阶级正在重建他们的工会组织，而且无产阶级的统一正在形成。农民保存好他们的武器，游击队改变为工会组织来合法地推进他们的斗争。
    农民正在为争取土地进行斗争，在某些地方事实上他们已夺取了土地，强迫地主和政府分配了某些庄园土地。城市里的工人和人民反对生活费用昂贵，并进行了好几次示威游行，反对交通费用上涨。学生们走上了他们的斗争岗位，和人民一起抗议高昂的物价和低微的工资。
    共产党在经历了十年地下生活以后，虽然现在还受着各种限制，例如不能把自己的代表选到议会机构里去，但它已取得了合法地位。它在过去是一个在独裁统治下进行坚决斗争的党，因此今天在人民群众中享有很高的威信。反共已不得人心，因为这是过去历届反动独裁统治者为了迫害所有爱国者而打出来的旗子。
    共产党在去年12月举行的第八次代表大会总结了党在镇压时期的艰苦年月里所进行的工作；修改了党章，使它符合今天的条件；根据国内政治形势拟定了策略路线；通过纲领宣言；以及在地下斗争的丰富经验的基础上，把组织、思想和政治建设推进了一步。各国兄弟党，特别是社会主义阵营的各国兄弟党的经验对我们有很大帮助。苏联共产党和中国共产党的经验对于锻炼我们拉丁美洲各国共产党是一个极其有力和宝贵的贡献。
    争取民主自由和民族独立的斗争是哥伦比亚共产党人的中心政治任务。为了达到这个目的必须有一个坚强的共产党；所以党的第八次代表大会所规定的主要任务是在全国范围内建设党，来推进反帝和土地革命的各项巨大任务。
    共产党在其政策中提出了民族民主阵线的口号，反对独裁统治的残余，反对任何反对现政府（党承认它是合法的立宪政府）的颠复性的政变阴谋，因为企图打倒现政府的力量就是已被推翻的独裁统治的最反动的力量，他们想要重建反人民的恐怖政权。
    毫无疑问，以工人和农民为首的哥伦比亚人民，有了日益增长的进步势力和共产党，懂得怎样把国家从美帝国主义和民族叛徒的压迫下解放出来。社会主义阵营的每一个胜利都是对帝国主义的一个打击，也是对拉丁美洲各国人民斗争的支援。因此我们说，拉丁美洲各国人民正在同世界其他各国人民一起进行着反对共同敌人的斗争。（本报特约稿，赵铭贤译）
