The Story of Technician Xu Junyi
Wu Dazhi

At the Guangjiwei Workshop of the Anqing Iron and Steel Plant, worker comrades told me the story of technician Xu Junyi.

“Do you know our technician Lao Xu? His name is Xu Junyi. He came to us last autumn during the great upsurge in the iron and steel industry. Recently, during the great technical revolution, he made two very meaningful improvements and innovations that have greatly impacted blast furnace production… Oh! Are you interested in this? Good, then let me introduce him to you.

“His first creation is called the water-sealed dust collector. Our original dust collector wasn’t very efficient. A lot of dust from the gas was carried into the hot blast stove, sticking to the hot air pipes in large quantities, sometimes up to an inch thick, causing the wind temperature to drop by two to three hundred degrees, which greatly affected production. At the same time, the flues were often blocked by dust. Last December, the flue of No. 1 blast furnace was blocked, and the gas couldn’t burn in the hot blast stove. At that time, there was no way to solve this except the workshop director had to crawl in and clear it. Of course, the factory Party committee criticized him for this, because it was very dangerous and could easily lead to gas poisoning. Also, cleaning the dust collector was very troublesome. Every time, we had to cut off the gas, which meant we could only send cold air. All these things had a great impact on production, and sometimes even caused hearth-freezing accidents.

“Technician Lao Xu was very worried when he saw this. He thought about it for a long time, and one night he and the workshop director ran to the blast furnace to study it together. He proposed implementing water-based dust removal. Don’t you know what water-based dust removal is? It’s very simple. It means sealing the explosion-proof door of the original dust collector, installing a water inlet pipe on the top, a water outlet pipe on the bottom, keeping a certain water level inside, and extending the gas downcomer a little longer so that it is inserted underwater, so that the gas is filtered by the water before entering the hot blast stove for combustion. The workshop director, who is also a very dedicated person, thought that Lao Xu’s method was very good and immediately agreed. To be on the safe side, the two of them returned to the dormitory and inserted a glass tube into a teacup, blowing smoke into it with their mouths. The color of the smoke after it came up from underwater was much lighter than before, indicating that the water had a great filtering effect. The next day, the factory Party committee learned about this. The Party secretary, Comrade Zhang Fengcheng, said to the workshop director: ‘Go ahead and do it boldly! Don’t worry, the factory Party committee supports you.’ At that time, No. 3 and No. 4 blast furnaces were under repair, so we took advantage of this gap to modify the dust collector. After it was done, the effect was really good. The gas could be basically cleaned after filtering by the water. You just visited the hot blast stove of our No. 3 and No. 4 blast furnaces. You opened the air control valve. Didn’t you see any ash spraying out? This shows that the inside of the hot blast stove is very clean. In this way, the wind temperature can always be maintained between 620 degrees and 740 degrees, the periodic decrease phenomenon is gone, the furnace condition is naturally stable, and the troubles of cleaning the hot blast stove and clearing the flue are gone. Just twist open the drain pipe to release the dust in the dust collector. See how good that is! At the same time, because the water seals the gas downcomer, the gas will not flow back and cause an explosion in the dust collector, so we call this dust collector a water-sealed dust collector.

“Our technician also created a local method of steam blast. This story is also very interesting. Our small blast furnace had a strange phenomenon in production before: the output was often higher at night than during the day. Most people didn’t notice this, but it was discovered by Xu Junyi. He thought that, except for the fact that the air was more humid at night, all other conditions were the same as during the day. This made him think of the large blast furnaces using boiler steam blast. But we don’t have a boiler. What should we do? Our Lao Xu thought about it and came up with a solution. One night, in the blower room of No. 1 blast furnace, he filled a teapot with water and opened the faucet to add water to the inlet pipe (about 40 kilograms of water per hour). An hour later, he looked into the furnace from the tuyere and saw that the fire was burning very brightly. Originally, there were many poorly burned coke near the tuyere, but they quickly became as bright as the inside. This shows that the furnace temperature has increased significantly. Rechecking the blower, the blower was no longer heating up. Wow! It's really unexpected that adding a little water to the inlet pipe would have such benefits. In this way, the local method of steam blast was created here.

“Now, water-based dust removal has been used in two blast furnaces, and local steam blast has been used in all blast furnaces. In addition, we have improved the hot blast stove and adopted high wind temperature and high wind pressure operation. The production of pig iron has increased rapidly. The output in early March increased by 143% compared with early February, and the quality is also very good. Our technician is very hardworking and has recently been praised by the factory Party committee. His innovations and improvements are also very valuable. I heard that other places have not done this yet. Comrade reporter, please introduce us in the newspaper so that these advanced experiences can blossom and bear fruit in small blast furnaces throughout the province.”

    技术员徐君毅的故事
    吴达之
    在安庆钢铁厂广济圩车间，工人同志们向我讲了技术员徐君毅的故事。
      “你认识我们的技术员老徐吗？他叫徐君毅，是去年秋天大办钢铁工业时，来到我们这里的。最近在大闹技术革命中，他作出了两项很有意义的改进和创造，对高炉生产起很大作用……噢！你对这有兴趣？好，那就让我给你介绍介绍吧。
      “他的头一个创造叫做水密封式除尘器。我们原来的除尘器除尘效率不高，煤气里的许多灰尘都带进热风炉里，大量附着在热风管上，有时厚达一寸多，使风温下降二、三百度，对生产影响很大。同时，烟道也经常被灰尘堵塞。去年12月份，一号高炉烟道堵塞了，煤气烧不到热风炉里去，当时没有办法，车间主任钻进去才把它掏通，当然这次受到了厂党委的批评，因为这样做十分危险，很容易发生煤气中毒事故。还有，清除除尘器里的灰尘也很费事，每次都要把煤气切断，这样就只能送冷风了。所有这些，对生产的影响都很大，有时甚至造成结底事故。
      “技术员老徐看到这个情况很着急，他想了很久，有一天夜里又和车间主任一起跑到高炉上进行研究。他提议实行水法除尘。水法除尘你不懂？说起来也很简单，就是把原来除尘器的防尘器的防爆门封起来，上面装上进水管，下面装上出水管，里面保持一定水位，再把煤气下降管接长一些，插到水下，使煤气经过水的过滤，再进入热风炉燃烧。车间主任也是一位很有钻劲的人，觉得老徐提的这个办法很好，立即表示赞成。为了慎重起见，两个人又回到宿舍里，把一支玻璃管插在茶杯里，用嘴向里面吹烟进行试验，烟气从水下翻上来后，颜色比原来淡得多了，说明水的过滤作用很大。第二天，厂党委知道了这件事，党委书记张凤城同志对车间主任说：‘你们大胆干吧！不要有顾虑，厂党委支持你们。’当时正好三、四号高炉检修，我们就利用这个空隙对除尘器进行了改造。搞好以后一试，效果可真好，煤气经过水的过滤之后，灰尘可以基本除净。刚才你参观过我们三、四号高炉的热风炉，打开空气调节阀，没看有灰喷出来吧！这说明热风炉里面很清洁。这样一来，风温可以始终保持在六百二十度到七百四十度之间，周期性的下降现象没有了，炉况自然也就稳定了，清理热风炉、通烟道等各种麻烦也没有了，除尘器里的灰尘只要扭开出水管就放出来了。你看这该有多好！同时，因为水把煤气下降管密封住，煤气也不会倒流而引起除尘器爆炸事故了，所以我们把这种除尘器叫作水密封式除尘器。
    “我们的技术员还创造一种土法蒸汽鼓风。这件事讲起来也很有意思。我们的小高炉以前在生产中有一个奇怪的现象，常常是夜里产量比白天高。这件事一般人并没有注意，但是却被徐君毅发现了。他想，除了夜里空气比较潮湿以外，其他任何条件都和白天一样，这一下使他联想到大高炉用锅炉蒸汽鼓风的事。可是我们没有锅炉，怎么办呢？我们的老徐想来想去，又有了办法。一天夜里，他在一号高炉鼓风机房里，把茶桶装上水，打开龙头向进风管里加水（每小时大约加水四十公斤），一个钟点以后，他又从高炉风眼中向炉里一看，呵！里面的火烧得可旺啦。原来靠风眼旁边，有不少烧得不好的焦炭，都很快变得和里面一样明亮了。这说明炉温已经显著提高。再检查鼓风机，鼓风机也不发热了。嗬！真想不到在进风管里加点水会有这样的好处。就这样，土法蒸汽鼓风就在我们这儿创造出来了。
    “现在，水法除尘已经在两座高炉上使用，土法蒸汽鼓风已在全部高炉上使用，加上我们又改进了热风炉、采取了高风温、高风压操作，生铁产量有了飞快提高，3月上旬产量比2月上旬增加了143％，质量也很好。我们的技术员钻劲很大，最近受到了厂党委的表扬，他的创造和改进价值也很高，听说别的地方还没有这么做。记者同志，就请你给我们在报纸上介绍一下，让这些先进经验在全省的小高炉上开花结果吧。”　　　　　　　　　　（原载3月31日安徽日报）
