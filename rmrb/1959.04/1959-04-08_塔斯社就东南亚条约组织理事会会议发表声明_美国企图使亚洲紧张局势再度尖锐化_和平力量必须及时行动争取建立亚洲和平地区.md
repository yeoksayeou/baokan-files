Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th - TASS issued the following statement on the upcoming Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Council meeting on the 6th:

    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), a military-political bloc, will hold its regular council meeting on April 8, 1959, in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand.

    It has been more than four years since this military bloc cobbled together by colonial powers came into being. During this period, the nature and purpose of SEATO have been fully exposed as an aggressive bloc established as a tool for war preparations in the Southeast Asian region. Over the years, the actions of SEATO have clearly shown that the purpose of this military bloc is to maintain and consolidate the economic and political positions of the imperialist countries and to suppress the national liberation movements of the peoples of the East.

    To conceal the aggressive and anti-popular essence of this bloc, the representatives of the main countries of SEATO brazenly claim to be "peace-loving." However, there is a saying in the East that a tiger crouching down is never a sign of mercy. Indeed, the facts show that the measures taken by SEATO always lead to the escalation of tensions in Southeast Asia.

    From the official statements of military and political leaders of SEATO member states, it can be seen that the upcoming meeting of the SEATO Council in Wellington will formulate plans for the further rampant activities of this military-political bloc. The nature of the issues on the agenda of the Wellington meeting indicates that the Western countries, especially the United States, which plays a major role in this organization, are attempting to sharpen tensions in Asia again.

    The upcoming meeting of the SEATO Council will first draft a strategic plan to intensify the war preparations of SEATO member states. Since the "Baghdad Pact" lost Baghdad, the United States and other colonial countries have repeatedly attempted to consolidate their crumbling positions and strengthen the various blocs they have established, including SEATO. One fact alone proves this: the SEATO Military Advisors' Conference held in Bangkok in September 1958 adopted a special decision on formulating a new plan for Southeast Asian "defense." The "defense" referred to here actually means making the member states of this military bloc even more subservient to Washington's military strategic plans.

    The excuse that these plans are "defensive" is difficult to deceive the people of Asian countries, who are increasingly beginning to understand that dirty deals are being done behind the heavy curtains of SEATO headquarters.

    At the Wellington meeting, the main members of this bloc will try to set up military bases for nuclear weapons and rocket weapons on the territories of their Asian allies, thus turning the territories of some Asian countries, such as Thailand, Pakistan, and the Philippines, into offensive bases in the event of a rocket-nuclear war. This is a fatal threat to these countries, so where is the "defense" that they are talking about?

    The plan to use this session of the SEATO Council to unite the three aggressive blocs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and SEATO cannot but cause serious concern to the people of all countries. In this regard, it should be noted that SEATO Secretary-General Nai Pote Sarasin recently visited the main member states of NATO and the Baghdad Pact Organization. It is known that the leaders of these military treaties intend to establish a specialized coordination mechanism composed of the three blocs of NATO, the Baghdad Pact, and SEATO. The purpose of all these measures is to ensure that SEATO eventually becomes an appendage of NATO, the main aggressive bloc. If, in the past, the SEATO bloc was de facto subordinate to NATO, now it is necessary to fix this subordinate relationship in an organizational form. In this way, SEATO is increasingly becoming a fence, and the colonialists and the main heads of this group are trying to keep those Southeast Asian countries that are subordinate to them in this fence.

    It is also intriguing that the colonial countries intend to draw up plans in Wellington to combat so-called "subversive activities" in Southeast Asian countries. It has long been known that the "subversive activities" mentioned by the United States and the ruling groups of other SEATO members usually refer to the people's struggle to get rid of the remnants of colonial oppression and their efforts to strengthen national independence.

    Not long ago, the rebels in Indonesia, with the assistance of SEATO, attempted to overthrow the legitimate government that firmly opposed joining military blocs. The heroic struggle of the freedom-loving Indonesian people shattered this sinister plan. However, judging from newspaper reports, the generals of SEATO have apparently not given up their conspiracy.

    The leaders of SEATO recently attempted to replicate the "Indonesian method" in Cambodia. In recent years, certain groups in the United States have spent a lot of effort, with the assistance of those countries that depend on it, to constantly exert pressure on Cambodia, and have attempted to force the Cambodian people to abandon their neutral policy by creating border provocations and plotting subversive activities in Cambodia. It is known that certain member states of SEATO directly assist the traitors of the Cambodian people with weapons and funds. These traitors attempt to overthrow the current government of Cambodia and drag the country onto the dangerous path of joining aggressive blocs.

    The policies of the leaders of the military bloc, especially the US leaders, also pose a serious danger to other Southeast Asian countries, including India, a point to which the Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru himself have justly drawn attention.

    Not long ago, the United States signed new bilateral agreements with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan, which enabled those who manipulate SEATO to link the countries that depend on them more closely with their own adventurous plans.

    It can be seen that the clamor against "subversive activities" is nothing but a disguise for those who are trying to promote old colonial policies in Southeast Asia by new means. If we face the facts, we should admit that it is SEATO that is carrying out subversive activities against countries that insist on taking the path of independent national development. Actions such as clumsy displays of military strength also serve these purposes of the colonialists.

    In order to exert pressure on the people of Southeast Asian countries, SEATO members are widely conducting military exercises and learning how to use nuclear weapons. It is worth noting that, according to newspaper reports, the largest military exercise in peacetime is scheduled to take place before the SEATO Council meeting in Wellington.

    The Soviet Union consistently pursues a foreign policy aimed at maintaining and consolidating peace, and firmly believes that the necessary trust and good neighborly relations between countries with different social systems, as well as strengthening peaceful exchanges between the peoples of all countries, can only be achieved by adopting measures to establish collective security, rather than by establishing military blocs of some countries and intensifying the activities of already established military blocs.

    Establishing a zone of peace in the Pacific region and throughout Asia, and first of all establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, is an important step in this regard. The fact that those countries with the vast majority of the population of the Far East and Southeast Asia firmly defend the cause of peace and advocate the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction shows that there is a practical possibility of realizing this step.

    The timely actions taken by the forces of peace to establish such a region will help the countries of this region make a significant contribution to the common cause of safeguarding international security, thereby saving Asian countries from the threat of devastating nuclear and rocket wars, and making the Pacific Ocean no longer a dangerous place for NATO member states to test atomic and hydrogen weapons. Only by adopting this method to solve the urgent security problems faced by the Asian people can the historically significant resolutions of the Bandung Conference be fully realized, a resolution that the Soviet Union has supported in the past and will continue to support.

    塔斯社就东南亚条约组织理事会会议发表声明
    美国企图使亚洲紧张局势再度尖锐化
    和平力量必须及时行动争取建立亚洲和平地区
    新华社莫斯科7日电　塔斯社6日就东南亚条约组织理事会将要举行会议，发表声明如下：
    东南亚军事政治集团——东南亚条约组织理事会例会即将于1959年4月8日在新西兰首都惠灵顿开幕。
    自从殖民国家拼凑的这个军事集团出现以来，已经四年多。在这段期间，东南亚条约组织的本质和目的已经暴露无遗，它是作为在东南亚地区进行备战的工具而建立起来的侵略集团。这些年来，东南亚条约组织的所作所为清楚地表明，这个军事集团的目的是维护和巩固帝国主义国家的经济和政治阵地，是镇压东方各国人民的民族解放运动。
    东南亚条约组织主要国家的代表为了掩饰这个集团的侵略实质和反人民实质，竟大言不惭地声称自己“爱好和平”。但是，东方有一句话说，老虎蹲下来决不是发慈悲。诚然，事实说明，东南亚条约组织所采取的措施总是导致东南亚地区紧张局势的加剧。
    从东南亚条约组织成员国军政领导人的正式声明中可以看出，在东南亚条约组织理事会即将举行的会议上将制定这个军事政治集团进一步猖狂活动的计划。列入惠灵顿会议议程的问题的性质，说明西方国家，首先是在这个组织中扮演主要角色的美国，企图使亚洲紧张局势再度尖锐化。
    东南亚条约组织理事会即将举行的会议将首先起草战略计划，以便加紧东南亚条约组织成员国的备战活动。自从“巴格达条约”失掉了巴格达之后，美国和其他殖民国家就一再企图巩固它们摇摇欲坠的阵地，加强它们所建立的各种集团，其中包括东南亚条约组织。只要举出下面一个事实就可以证明这一点，1958年9月在曼谷举行的东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议曾经通过一项关于制订东南亚“防务”新计划的特别决定，这里所指的“防务”其实就是促使这个军事集团的成员国更加屈从于华盛顿的军事战略计划。
    说什么这些计划是“防御性的”，这种借口很难迷惑亚洲国家的人民，他们日益开始明白，在东南亚条约组织大本营的重重黑幕中，干的是肮脏的勾当。
    在惠灵顿会议上，这个集团的主要成员国将设法在它们的亚洲盟国的领土上设置核武器和火箭武器军事基地，从而使泰国、巴基斯坦、菲律宾这样的一些亚洲国家的领土在一旦发生火箭—核战争的时候变成进攻基地，这种作法对这些国家是一种致命的威胁，既然如此，又哪里谈得上什么“防务”呢？
    利用东南亚条约组织理事会本届会议来联合北大西洋公约组织、巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织三个侵略集团的这一计划，也不能不引起各国人民严重的不安。在这方面应当注意到，东南亚条约组织秘书长乃朴·沙拉信不久以前曾经到北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约组织的主要成员国去访问。大家知道，这些军事条约的领导人打算成立由北大西洋公约组织、巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织这三个集团组成的一个专门的协作机构。所有这些措施的目的是保证东南亚条约组织最后变成北大西洋公约组织这个主要的侵略集团的附属品。如果说，以前东南亚条约组织集团是实际上从属于北大西洋公约组织的，那么，现在就是要把这种从属关系以组织形式固定下来。这样一来，东南亚条约组织日益变成一种围栏，殖民主义者和这个集团的主要头目企图把那些隶属于它们的东南亚国家关在这个围栏里。
    殖民主义国家打算在惠灵顿编制反对所谓在东南亚国家的“颠复活动”的计划，这也是耐人寻味的。大家早就知道，美国和东南亚条约组织其他成员国的统治集团所说的“颠复活动”，通常是指各国人民为摆脱殖民主义压迫的残余所作的斗争和加强民族独立所作的努力。
    不久以前，印度尼西亚的叛乱分子在东南亚条约组织的协助下，曾经打算推翻坚决反对参加军事集团的合法政府，这件事大家记忆犹新。爱好自由的印度尼西亚人民的英勇斗争粉碎了这种罪恶的计划。但是，从报纸消息看来，东南亚条约组织的将领显然没有放弃他们的阴谋。
    东南亚条约组织的领导人不久以前曾经企图把“在印度尼西亚的搞法”在柬埔寨如法炮制。最近几年来，美国的某些集团曾经花了不少工夫，在依附它的那些国家的协助下，经常对柬埔寨施加压力，并且企图通过制造边境挑衅事件和在柬埔寨国内策划颠复活动的办法来使柬埔寨人民放弃中立政策。大家知道，东南亚条约组织的某些成员国直接以武器和资金来帮助柬埔寨人民的叛徒，这些叛徒企图推翻柬埔寨的现政府，并且把这个国家拖上参加侵略集团的危险道路。
    军事集团的领导人，首先是美国领导人的政策，对东南亚其他国家，其中包括印度，也造成严重的危险，印度政府和尼赫鲁总理本人公正地提醒注意这一点。
    不久以前，美国和伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦签订了新的双边协定，这就使操纵东南亚条约组织的人能够把依附于他们的国家同他们自己的冒险计划更紧密地联结在一起。
    由此可见，什么反对“颠复活动”的叫嚷不外是企图用新的手法在东南亚推行旧的殖民主义政策的那些人的伪装而已。如果我们正视事实，那就应该承认，正是东南亚条约组织在对那些坚持走独立的民族发展道路的国家进行颠复活动。拙劣地显示军事力量等这样一些举动，也是为殖民主义者的这些目的服务的。
    为了对东南亚各国人民施加压力，东南亚条约组织的成员国广泛举行军事演习，并且在学习使用核武器。值得注意的是，据报纸报道，在东南亚条约组织理事会惠灵顿会议召开之前，预先安排了和平时期规模最大的一次军事演习。
    苏联一贯执行目的在于维护和巩固和平的外交政策，并且坚信，要想在不同社会制度的各国之间建立必要的信任和睦邻关系，以及加强各国人民的和平往来，只有采取建立集体安全的办法，而不是采取建立一些国家的军事集团和使已经建立的军事集团加紧活动的办法。
    在太平洋区域和在整个亚洲建立和平地区，首先是建立无核武器地区，是在这个方面的一个重要步骤。有着远东和东南亚绝大多数人口的那些国家，坚决地捍卫和平事业和主张禁止大规模毁灭性的武器，这一事实说明有实现这一步骤的实际可能性。
    和平力量为了建立这样的地区而及时采取的行动有助于使这个地区的国家对保障国际安全的共同事业作出重大贡献，从而使亚洲国家免受毁灭性的核、火箭战争祸害的威胁，而使太平洋不再是北大西洋公约组织成员国试验原子武器和氢武器的危险场所。只有采取这种办法来解决亚洲人民所面临的迫切的安全问题，才能够使万隆会议有历史意义的决议得以完全实现，而苏联过去拥护并且还将继续拥护这项决议。
