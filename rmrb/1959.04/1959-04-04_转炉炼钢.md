    Bessemer Steelmaking
    The furnace body of a Bessemer converter is pear-shaped, with a furnace capacity generally ranging from hundreds of kilograms to hundreds of tons. Due to the different properties of the refractory materials used for the furnace lining, it is divided into acidic Bessemer converters and basic Bessemer converters.
    Bessemer steelmaking does not require fuel heating. It relies solely on blowing air (oxygen) into the furnace to oxidize elements such as carbon, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus in the molten iron, thereby obtaining chemical heat energy to raise the temperature of the molten steel for steelmaking.
    The investment in building a Bessemer converter is relatively small, the speed is fast, the steelmaking time is short, and the output is also high. However, its disadvantage is that the quality of the steel is relatively poor, and it generally produces low-carbon steel and medium-carbon steel. Due to the splashing of molten iron during the blowing process, the loss of metal is large. Therefore, the consumption of pig iron to produce one ton of steel is generally 1.2 tons to 1.3 tons. Mixing Bessemer converters with electric furnaces for steelmaking can smelt high-quality alloy steel.

    转炉炼钢
    转炉的炉体成梨形，炉容量一般的从几百公斤到百吨。由于炉衬使用耐火材料性质的不同，分为酸性转炉及碱性转炉。
    转炉炼钢，它不需要燃料加热，只靠吹入炉内的空气（氧），氧化铁水中的炭矽、锰、磷等元素而获得化学热能来提高钢水温度进行炼钢。
    建设转炉的投资比较少，速度快，炼钢时间短，产量也高。但它的缺点是钢的质量较差，一般生产低炭钢和中炭钢。由于在吹炼过程中有铁水喷溅，金属的损失大，所以炼一吨钢消耗的生铁一般为一点二吨到一点三吨。转炉与电炉混合炼钢，可以冶炼出质量良好的合金钢。
