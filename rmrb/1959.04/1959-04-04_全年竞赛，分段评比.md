    Year-Round Competition, Segmented Evaluation
    Fu Jun
    This year’s spring production upsurge sees competition unfolding in various regions. With unity from top to bottom, and everyone encouraged, competition has become a good method for leading mass production movements—a mass line leadership approach.
      "Nothing is feared more than comparison; a comparison reveals who is superior and who is inferior!" After one evaluation and two comparisons, the advanced and the backward, the experiences and the lessons, become crystal clear. Therefore, in competition, evaluations must be conducted frequently and promptly. The "Year-Round Competition, Segmented Evaluation" system implemented by the Shihe People's Commune in Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, is a good method. In this way, there is an overall annual goal, new requirements for each segment, regular inspections and evaluations, and a final year-end assessment, which ensures that the key principles are clear and each segment is well-defined. With the development of production and the surge in mass enthusiasm for production, competition will inevitably be pushed from one climax to another.
    The benefits of "Year-Round Competition, Segmented Evaluation" are obvious. First, it allows for the timely summarization and exchange of experiences, preventing many good experiences and new creations in the work from being buried for long periods. Second, it enables the timely discovery and resolution of problems, preventing work-related issues from piling up. Third, it ensures that the focus of the work is always grasped from beginning to end, with a clear center, rather than a scattershot approach without specific targets. Fourth, it allows for the establishment of role models, continuously learning from and catching up with the advanced, and constantly maintaining and promoting the enthusiasm and fighting spirit of the masses. Overall, the adoption of year-round competition and segmented evaluation not only keeps the leading cadres well-informed about the work for the year and each stage but also keeps the masses informed. Timely inspections and evaluations ensure that the competition movement progresses wave after wave, each wave higher than the last, which will play a significant role in ensuring the completion of this year’s production plan.
    To implement "Year-Round Competition, Segmented Evaluation," a series of tasks must be carried out diligently. The commune Party committee secretary must frequently supervise, inspect, and participate in this work, ensuring that inspections and evaluations are uninterrupted. The leadership must not only comprehensively arrange the annual production plan but also carefully study the work priorities for each period with the masses, being adept at grasping the key points and the crucial issues as the center of competition and evaluation for each period. For example, the Shihe Commune previously focused on accumulating fertilizer and cultivating seedlings as the center of evaluation, and the next stage will focus on seedling field management. This clearly points out the main direction of the battle for the masses. At the same time, ideological education must be constantly strengthened. After each evaluation, the advanced must not be arrogant, and the backward must not be discouraged. "Tall people don't bend down, short people grow hard. As long as we have great ambitions and sufficient drive, we will definitely catch up!" Yangqiao Production Brigade, which had relatively poor production, showed this heroic spirit in the recent evaluation in Shihe Commune. After the evaluation, this brigade immediately formulated a concrete plan on how to catch up with the advanced teams and immediately began a new battle. Yuqiao Brigade, as a model team, is even more confident and is doing everything possible to maintain its model honor. In this way, whether it is an advanced team or a backward team, the enthusiasm of the masses is greater after each evaluation. To help the backward catch up with the advanced, the commune must also strengthen its leadership over the backward teams after the evaluation, provide more specific assistance, and strengthen the confidence of the backward teams in catching up with the advanced.
    March, with its warm sun and gentle breezes, is the season for heroes to show their skills on the production front. Let the tide of competition be higher and greater! Let's see who has more heroes on this year's competition list!

    全年竞赛，分段评比
    傅钧
    今年春季生产高潮，各地都在开展竞赛。上下一心，人人鼓劲竞赛已成为领导群众生产运动的好方法。群众路线的领导方法。
      “凡事只怕比，一比见高低！”经过一评二比，先进和落后，经验和教训，就显得清清楚楚。因此，在竞赛中，必须经常地及时地进行评比。安徽省桐城县石河人民公社实行“全年竞赛、分段评比”，是个好办法。这样做，一年有一年的总目标，一段有一段的新要求，定期检查评比，年底进行总评，就能做到纲举目张，段落分明。随着生产的发展，群众生产积极性的高涨，竞赛必然会不断地从一个高潮推向另一个高潮。
    “全年竞赛，分段评比”的好处是很显然的。首先，可以及时总结经验、交流经验，使工作中许多好的经验和新的创造，不致长期埋没。其次，可以及时发现问题、解决问题，不致使工作中的问题成堆。第三，可以自始至终抓住工作重点，中心明确，不是漫无目标一把抓。第四，可以树立旗帜，不断地学先进、赶先进，经常保持并发扬群众的热情和斗志。总起来说，采取全年竞赛、分段评比的办法，对一年和每一阶段的工作，不仅领导干部心中有数，而且群众心中有数，及时检查评比，竞赛运动一浪逐一浪，一浪比一浪更高，对保证完成今年生产计划会起很大作用。
    实行“全年竞赛，分段评比”，必须认真做好一系列的工作。公社党委书记必须经常督促、检查和参加这个工作，保证检查评比不间断。领导方面既要全面安排好一年的生产计划，又要认真地和群众研究每一个时期的工作重点，善于抓住重点，抓住关键问题，作为每一时期竞赛评比的中心。例如石河公社前一时期评比以积肥和育秧为中心，下一阶段就以秧田管理为中心。这样，就非常明确地给群众指出了战斗的主攻方向。同时，还必须经常加强思想教育工作。在每次评比以后，都要使先进者不骄傲、落后者不气馁。“高个子不弯腰，矮子狠狠长，只要志大干劲足，一定能赶上！”最近石河公社评比中，生产较差的杨桥生产大队就有这种英雄气魄。这个大队在评比后立即拟订了如何赶上先进队的具体计划，立即开始新的战斗。作为模范队的余桥大队，更是信心百倍，千方百计地要保持模范的荣誉。这样，不管是先进队或是落后队，群众的干劲在每次评比以后都更大了。为了帮助落后的赶上先进的，公社在评比以后还必须加强对落后队的领导，多给予具体的帮助，加强落后队赶上先进队的信心。
    阳春三月，风和日丽，在生产战线上，正是英雄用武的季节。让竞赛的浪潮更高更大吧！请看今年竞赛榜，竟是谁家英雄多！
