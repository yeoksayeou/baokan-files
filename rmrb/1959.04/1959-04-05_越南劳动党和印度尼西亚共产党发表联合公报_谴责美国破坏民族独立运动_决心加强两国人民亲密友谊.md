Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 4th: The Vietnam Workers' Party and the Indonesian Communist Party today issued a joint communiqué stating that the current paramount task is to fight for the preservation of peace.

The communiqué stated that both sides will strive for step-by-step, supervised disarmament, the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and the elimination of policies regarding the establishment of military aggression blocs and military bases in foreign countries.

The delegation of the Indonesian Communist Party, headed by General Secretary D.N. Aidit, visited Vietnam from March 28th to April 4th. The communiqué stated that the Indonesian Communist Party delegation exchanged views with members of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party in a brotherly and cordial atmosphere on international issues and issues related to the two countries. Both sides expressed great satisfaction with the complete agreement reached on the issues raised.

The communiqué stated that both sides were pleased with the brilliant achievements of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This congress not only demonstrated a new stage of development in the Soviet Union, but also opened a new era for humanity, namely, a new era in which progressive humanity possesses an increasing practical ability to stop wars.

The communiqué stated that both sides warmly welcomed the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit conference to discuss and resolve the most pressing and important current issues such as the signing of a peace treaty with Germany and West Berlin.

The communiqué stated that, regarding the situation in the regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, both sides were pleased to see the increasing development of the Bandung spirit, the independence already achieved by many countries, and the growing strength of the national liberation movement, which will surely achieve greater victories, thereby accelerating the final collapse of colonialism and imperialism.

The communiqué stated that both sides unanimously and firmly support the heroic struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence. At present, imperialism is still conspiring to undermine the national independence of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, doing everything possible to alienate various nations, and plotting to establish military dictatorships through subversive activities. In Southeast Asia, U.S. imperialism is intensifying the activities of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, exacerbating tensions, and preparing to launch new wars, thereby seriously threatening the peace and security of countries in this region. Both sides declare their firm opposition to this sinister conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and firmly believe that as long as the people of Asia and peace-loving people around the world unite closely, imperialism will suffer a painful defeat.

The communiqué stated that both sides strongly oppose the revival of Japanese militarism, which has brought disaster to Asian and world countries.

The communiqué stated that both sides fully support the Chinese government's proposal to conclude a collective security treaty for the Asian and Pacific region.

The communiqué stated that both sides were very pleased to see the development and growing consolidation of friendly relations between Vietnam and Indonesia. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's recent visit to Indonesia made a tremendous contribution to enhancing the friendly relations between the peoples of the two countries. President Sukarno's upcoming visit to Vietnam will further strengthen this close relationship between the two countries.

The communiqué stated that both sides fully support each other in the struggle of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian and the struggle of the Vietnamese people to reunify their motherland. The communiqué stated that both sides were pleased with the unbreakable unity of the current international communist and workers' movement. Both sides will resolutely struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and wage an uncompromising struggle against revisionism, specifically manifested in the program of the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Both sides will continuously strive to contribute to the unity of the international communist and workers' movement, to the unity of the world's peace forces, and to the final victory of peace and social progress.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 4th: The delegation of the Indonesian Communist Party, headed by Comrade D.N. Aidit, left Vietnam by plane this morning to return home after a week-long visit to Vietnam.
