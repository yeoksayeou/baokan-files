    This newspaper reports: Anshan Iron and Steel's four large open-hearth furnaces, No. 4, No. 10, No. 12, and No. 18, overfulfilled their production plans for the first and middle ten days of April, producing a total of 3,946 tons of high-quality steel more for the state. Among them, the Youth Solidarity Furnace, namely No. 4 open-hearth furnace, maintained an average open-hearth utilization coefficient of 11.85 tons, continuing to lead in the red flag competition among Anshan Iron and Steel's large open-hearth furnaces.
    After completing the plan for the first half of April ahead of schedule, this large open-hearth furnace meticulously inspected the furnace body and shortened the smelting time to celebrate the convening of the National People's Congress.
    On the 21st, the workers of the Class A shift of this open-hearth furnace smelted a batch of fast-smelting steel in seven hours and twenty minutes, shortening the time by three hours and four minutes compared to the plan.
    From the 1st to the 20th, six blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel's Ironmaking Plant, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 9, also overfulfilled the state production plan, producing a total of 3,499 tons of high-quality pig iron more for the state.
    The employees of Anshan Iron and Steel's Ironmaking Plant conducted an in-depth red flag competition to learn from and catch up with the advanced, and the output in the middle ten days of April increased by 9% compared to the first ten days. The average daily output was 1,125 tons of high-quality pig iron more than in the first ten days. No. 9 blast furnace, which had maintained the plant's red flag for eight months, was once surpassed by its competitor, No. 3 blast furnace, in the first ten days. The branch immediately convened a general meeting of all employees of the furnace, and everyone unanimously proposed that the blast furnace utilization coefficient must break through "two" and resolutely maintain the red flag. Through the efforts of all parties, the blast furnace utilization coefficient had already averaged 2.1 in the middle ten days of April, surpassing No. 3 blast furnace again. The utilization coefficient of No. 3 blast furnace also increased compared to the first ten days.
    This newspaper reports: Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled its pig iron production plan for the middle ten days of April by 1,940 tons, and from the 1st to the 20th, it accumulated a total overproduction of 5,001 tons of pig iron.
    At the beginning of April, the company's Party committee put forward to the employees the index for increasing the blast furnace utilization coefficient and twenty-four measures to achieve the index, and through mobilizing the masses to "compete on the arena," each measure had a specific person in charge, ensuring that the measures were implemented.
    After the index was determined and the measures were implemented, a red flag competition centered on increasing the blast furnace utilization coefficient was launched between furnaces, shifts, groups, individuals, and processes. In the competition between the employees of No. 1 blast furnace and No. 2 blast furnace, they studied and developed four important measures, such as developing edge gas and promoting small batch charging, to catch up with No. 2 blast furnace. Production progressed rapidly in April, with the utilization coefficient increasing by 13.3% compared to the same period last month, the smelting intensity increasing by 14% compared to last month, and the plan for the first half of the month being completed with an overproduction of 1,124 tons of pig iron. Class B of the charging shift of No. 2 blast furnace strengthened the coordination between processes in the competition, creating a record of charging sixteen batches of material per hour, and was named a red flag shift. The charging workers of Class C were not to be outdone, seriously learning from the experience of Class B and charging half a batch of material more per hour than Class B. After Class B shortened the charging time per batch by ten seconds, Class C made persistent efforts and finally created a new record of charging nineteen batches of material per hour. In order to ensure that the blast furnace was well-fed, the employees of the raw material workshop organized more than 100 family members of employees to pick waste stones from the ore, picking 50 tons of waste stones every day. Every ton of waste stones picked could save 500 jin of coke and one ton of limestone, and create favorable conditions for increasing pig iron production.
    Currently, the employees of this company are working hard to overproduce more pig iron in April.
    This newspaper reports: The electric furnace steel of Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Second Steelmaking Plant has overfulfilled the production plan for the first and middle ten days of April ahead of schedule by one day and nine hours. Since entering the decisive second quarter, the plant's production level has been continuously rising. In the first twenty days of April, the average daily production level of electric furnaces increased by 18.29% compared to March, the alloy ratio reached 69.18%, and the average utilization coefficient of electric furnaces was 38.904.
    The main reason for these achievements is that the employees of this plant continued to exert their revolutionary efforts in the second quarter, established the concept of completing the state plan on a daily and ten-day basis, fully mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovation, and created advanced experiences in rapid desulfurization and dephosphorization with iron oxide scale, which significantly improved the efficiency of sulfur and phosphorus removal. At the same time, the Party committee secretary and the factory director personally went to the site to organize workers and technicians to solve key production problems. Currently, the workers' production enthusiasm is very high, and they expressed their determination to complete the April plan ahead of schedule.
    This newspaper reports: Under the inspiration of Premier Zhou's government work report, the broad masses of employees in Tianjin have launched a new upsurge of the Great Leap Forward to celebrate the convening of the first session of the Second National People's Congress. Good news has been frequently reported from Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant in the past two days. On the afternoon of the first day of the "Ten Days Red" competition launched by the employees of the shaped steel plant on the 21st, Class C of the second small rolling steel section created the highest record of 71 tons of light rails, firing the first shot. The medium-sized rolling steel section and the first small rolling steel section of this plant also overfulfilled the shift plan, achieving the first day of red shift for every shift. The employees of Tianjin Tractor Factory also continuously broke the quota on the 18th and 19th, and the shift output of gas engines increased from 50 units to 68 units. On the 18th, eighty veteran workers in Tianjin Steam Engine Factory broke the "thousand units per hour" quota, and more than fifty people also reached the "double thousand units per hour," among which six people even reached the three thousand units per hour quota.

    以实际行动庆祝人大二届首次会议召开
    鞍钢十座平炉高炉旬旬高产
    石钢二十天超产生铁五千吨，本钢二厂和天津型钢厂创造新成就
    本报讯　鞍钢四号、十号、十二号、十八号四座大型平炉超额完成了4月上、中旬的生产计划，一共为国家多生产了三千九百四十六吨优质钢。其中青年团结炉，就是四号平炉的平炉利用系数平均保持在十一点八五吨，青年团结炉，在鞍钢大型平炉的红旗竞赛中继续领先。
    这个大型平炉在提前完成4月前半月的计划以后，为了庆祝人民代表大会会议的召开，更加细致地检查了炉体，缩短了熔炼时间。
    21日，这个平炉的甲班工人用七小时二十分就炼出了一炉快速炼钢，比计划缩短了三小时零四分。
    鞍钢炼铁厂从1日到20日又有一、二、三、四、五、九六座高炉，超额完成了国家生产计划，一共给国家多生产了三千四百九十九吨优质生铁。
    鞍钢炼铁厂职工深入地开展了学先进、赶先进的红旗竞赛，4月中旬产量比上旬又提高9％。平均日产量比上旬多生产一千一百二十五吨优质生铁。一直保持八个月全厂红旗的九号高炉，在上旬一度被竞赛对手三号高炉超过，支部立即召开了全炉职工大会，大家一致提出高炉利用系数一定要突破“二”，坚决保住红旗。经过各方面的努力，在4月中旬高炉利用系数已经平均达到二点一。又超过了三号高炉，三号高炉的利用系数也比上旬有所提高。
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司超额一千九百四十吨完成了4月中旬生铁生产计划，1日至20日累计共超产生铁五千零一吨。
    这个公司的党委在4月初就向职工群众提出了提高高炉利用系数的指标，和实现指标的二十四项措施，并通过发动群众“打擂台”的形式，使每项措施都有了具体的负责人，做到了措施落实。
    在指标到底，措施落实以后，在炉与炉、班与班、组与组、人与人以及工序与工序之间即展开了以提高高炉利用系数为中心的红旗竞赛。一高炉职工和二高炉职工竞赛中，研究出发展边缘煤气、推行小料批等四项重要措施追赶二高炉，4月里生产进步得很快，利用系数比上月同期提高了13.3％，冶炼强度比上月提高了14％，超额一千一百二十四吨生铁完成了上半月计划。二高炉上料乙班，在竞赛中加强了工序之间的协作，创造出每小时上料十六批的纪录，被评为红旗班。丙班上料工人也不示弱，认真学习乙班经验，比乙班每小时还多上半批料，等到乙班把每批上料时间缩短了十秒钟以后，丙班再接再厉，终于创造了每小时上十九批料的新纪录。原料车间的职工为了让高炉吃得饱吃得好，组织了一百多名职工家属从矿石中拣废石，每天拣五十吨废石，每拣出一吨废石，就可以节约五百斤焦炭和一吨石灰石，并且为提高生铁产量创造有利条件。
    现在，这个公司的职工正为4月份超额生产更多的生铁而努力。
    本报讯　本溪钢铁公司第二炼钢厂电炉钢已经提前一天零九小时超额完成4月份上、中旬的生产计划。这个厂从进入决定性的第二季度以来，生产水平不断上升，4月头二十天，电炉平均日产水平比3月份提高了18.29％，合金比达到69.18％，电炉平均利用系数是三十八点九零四。
    所以出现这些成绩，主要是由于这个厂的职工在二季度继续鼓足了革命干劲，树立按日按旬完成国家计划的观念，充分发动群众大搞技术革新，创造了快速脱硫，用氧化铁皮除磷的先进经验，使硫和磷的脱除效率有显著提高。同时，党委书记和厂长都亲自到现场组织工人、技术人员解决了生产关键问题。目前工人的生产情绪都很高，他们表示要坚决提前完成4月份计划。
    本报讯　天津市广大职工在周总理所作的政府工作报告的鼓舞下，掀起了一个新的跃进热潮，庆祝第二届全国人民代表大会首次会议的召开。天津第一钢厂这两天捷报频传。型钢厂的职工21日开展了“十日红”竞赛运动的第一天下午，第二小型轧钢工段丙班，就创造了班产七十一吨多轻便轨道的全厂最高纪录，打响了第一炮。这个厂的中型轧钢工段和第一小型轧钢工段，也都超额完成了班计划，实现了第一天的班班红。天津拖拉机厂的职工在18日19日两天也连续突破了定额，煤气机的班产量从五十台提高到了六十八台。天津蒸汽机厂18日有八十个老工人突破了“千台时”定额，有五十多人还达到了“双千台时”，其中有六个人更达到了三千台时定额。
