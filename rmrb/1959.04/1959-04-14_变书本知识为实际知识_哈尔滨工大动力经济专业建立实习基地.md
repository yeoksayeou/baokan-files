　　Transforming Book Knowledge into Practical Knowledge
　　Harbin Institute of Technology Power Economics Department Establishes Internship Base
    (Our report) Harbin Institute of Technology's Power Economics Department has established the Harbin Power Plant as a base for integrating teaching, production, and scientific research, enabling students to transform the book knowledge learned in the classroom into living knowledge.

    Second-year students, currently studying technical courses such as Mechanical Parts and Electrical Engineering Fundamentals, have mastered electrical and fitter skills in the overhaul of generator units and the installation of new machines, in conjunction with their coursework. Third-year students, working in boiler, turbine, and electrical operations departments, feel that their theoretical knowledge from technical courses has been consolidated, and they have also learned management skills in operations departments.

    The students in their fourth and some fifth years have the deepest understanding of the policy of combining teaching and productive labor. After basically completing their professional courses, they go to the power plant to take on production operation management and technical improvement work in the operating divisions, thus having more conditions to apply the theory they have learned to production practice, and using perceptual knowledge to supplement the shortcomings of book knowledge. Through practical operation and management work, they have become familiar with the power plant's production process and have systematically and firmly grasped basic knowledge such as production planning management and economic organization. After passing the power plant's examination and appraisal, they have respectively reached the levels of water operator, assistant driver, and assistant electrical duty officer.

    Senior students also conducted scientific research based on pressing problems that needed to be solved which they discovered during participation in the power plant's production and management, in conjunction with teaching. They proposed fourteen technical improvement plans and engineering projects, such as improving flue ducts, mechanizing coal conveying equipment, designing coal crushing systems, and mechanizing ash removal, which can effectively improve labor productivity. Ten of these have been adopted, and one project has been constructed according to the design.

　　变书本知识为实际知识
　　哈尔滨工大动力经济专业建立实习基地
    本报讯　哈尔滨工业大学动力经济专业，把哈尔滨发电厂作为教学、生产和科学研究三结合的基地，使学生把课堂所学的书本知识变成活知识。
    正在学机械零件和电工基础等技术课的二年级学生，在发电机组的检修和新机的安装中，结合所学课程掌握了电工和钳工技能。在锅炉、汽机、电气等运行部门劳动的三年级学生，感到所学的技术课程的理论知识巩固了，还学会了运行部门的管理技能。
    对教学和生产劳动相结合的方针体会最深刻的，是四年级和部分五年级学生。他们在基本上学完了专业课程后下电厂担任运行分场的生产运行管理和技术改进工作，因而更有条件把学到的理论运用到生产实践中去，又用感性知识补充了书本知识的不足。在实际的操作和管理工作中他们对电厂的生产过程熟悉了，也系统而牢固地掌握了生产中的计划管理和经济组织等基本知识。经过电厂考试鉴定，他们分别达到了司水、副司机和副电气值班员的水平。
    高年级的学生，还就参加电厂的生产和管理中发现的迫切需要解决的问题，结合教学进行了科学研究。他们提出了改进烟道、输煤设备机械化、碎煤系统设计、运灰机械化等十四项能有效地提高劳动生产率的技术改进方案和工程项目，有十项已被采纳，一项工程已按设计施工。
