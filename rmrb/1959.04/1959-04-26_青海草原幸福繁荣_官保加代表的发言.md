Qinghai Grasslands Thrive in Happiness and Prosperity
Speech by Representative Guan Baojia

Presidium, fellow representatives:

Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng, have filled me with excitement. In addition to wholeheartedly supporting them and striving to realize them in my work, I would now like to share some of my thoughts. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Close Unity Among All Ethnic Groups, Comprehensive Leap Forward in Various Construction Undertakings in Pastoral Areas

Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups across the country have completely abolished the oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords and domestic reactionaries. They have achieved unprecedented development in political, economic, cultural, educational, and health construction undertakings, and have achieved historically unprecedented great achievements, changing the poor and backward face left over from history. Under the shining light of the Party's policy of equality among nationalities, all ethnic groups are closely united, friendly and cooperative, thereby eliminating the estrangement and hostility between and within ethnic groups, and promoting their consolidated unity. Due to the resolute implementation of the Party and the state's policies on providing loans and relief to help poor farmers and herdsmen develop production, national regional autonomy, and fair and reasonable trade, the minority nationalities who have been subjected to long-term oppression and exploitation and unable to survive have gradually improved their production and living standards. With the highly communist and active assistance of Han cadres, all minority nationalities have fully realized their right to be masters of their own affairs and manage their own internal affairs. In 1958, like all parts of the country, Qinghai Province, under the shining light of the general line for building socialism, launched a comprehensive leap forward in various undertakings. Taking the pastoral areas where minority nationalities live as an example, under the guidance of focusing on animal husbandry and combining agriculture and animal husbandry to develop diversified operations, various livestock have developed rapidly and in large quantities. Veterinary and disease prevention work has achieved remarkable results, eliminating cattle plague, the most harmful disease in the past, and controlling diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, creating conditions for the leap forward in animal husbandry. At the same time, a large amount of wasteland has been reclaimed, and more grain has been produced. Outstanding achievements have also been made in building grassland water conservancy, eradicating grassland pests, and increasing grassland carrying capacity. In terms of industry and mining, abundant resources such as oil, iron, lead, copper, coal, and salt have begun to be mined and produced. In terms of culture and education, under the leadership and assistance of the Party, every commune, and even every production team, has one or more primary schools or senior primary schools. All states and counties have generally established ethnic normal schools, or junior high schools, and vocational schools for finance and economics, health, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, developing culture, education, science, and technology in minority areas. Great achievements have also been made in treating sexually transmitted diseases and other infectious diseases that are most painful for the people in pastoral areas. As diseases are reduced, the population is becoming more prosperous. The realization of people's communes is another extremely inspiring event in 1958. It not only guaranteed a comprehensive leap forward in various productions in pastoral areas, but also greatly improved the socialist awareness of the people and strengthened their confidence and determination to take the socialist road. As the people's awareness has been raised, a new atmosphere of close unity, mutual love, mutual approach, and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups has emerged on the grasslands.

The Reactionary Group in Tibet Launched a Rebellion That Completely Violates the Interests of the People of All Nationalities

The rapid development of pastoral areas in terms of politics, economy, culture, education, and medical and health care is the result of the Party's correct leadership and the selfless assistance of Han cadres. We firmly believe that under the shining light of the Party's general line, by uniting more closely around the Party and relying on the assistance of Han cadres, we will surely be able to achieve greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forwards in the construction of minority areas, and we will surely be able to enable the people of all ethnic groups to live a more prosperous, fulfilling, and happy life. Recently, most of the Kalons and the upper-level reactionary group of the former Tibetan local government, colluding with imperialism, openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and launched an armed rebellion. This is a heinous crime against the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities, and we express our great indignation. In the years since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Tibetans have seen a certain amount of development in the economy, culture, education, health, and in the cultivation of ethnic cadres. The broad masses of the Tibetan people wholeheartedly support the Communist Party and cherish the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities. However, the launching of a rebellion by the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet completely violates the will and interests of the people of the whole country, including the people of Tibet. The State Council's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government and completely quell the rebellion in Tibet is completely correct, and I express my heartfelt support.

The people of all nationalities in our country have long suffered from imperialist aggression and have suffered the bitterness of that oppression and enslavement. They have also persisted in a long-term revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, thereby driving away foreign imperialism and overthrowing domestic reactionary rule. From the day of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the life of being invaded and oppressed by imperialism and domestic reactionaries came to an end and will never return. Now the people of all ethnic groups are closely united around the Party, continuing to work hard to maintain the unity and consolidation of the motherland, and to further the unity of all ethnic groups. They are realizing the continued leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production and the continued improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups. They are building a better socialist society. In the future, we must unite more closely under the leadership of the Party and jointly build the big family of the motherland. Only in this way can we better build socialism and actively prepare for the transition to communism. The Han nationality is an advanced nationality. If we minority nationalities want to join the ranks of advanced nationalities, we must have the help of the Han people. Therefore, we must better strengthen our unity with the Han people, and constantly overcome and criticize local nationalism, so that all ethnic groups can love and help each other, and make unremitting efforts to continue strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups and the unification of the motherland.

    青海草原幸福繁荣
    官保加代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    周总理关于政府工作的报告及李富春、李先念副总理和彭副委员长的报告，使我万分兴奋，除衷心拥护并在工作中努力实现外，现在谈一点自己的感想，如有不妥之处请予指正。
    各族人民亲密团结，牧区各项建设事业全面跃进
    全国各族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，彻底废除了封建地主和国内反动派的压迫剥削，在政治、经济、文化、教育、卫生等建设事业上得到了空前的发展，并且获得了史无前例的伟大成绩，改变了历史上遗留下来的贫穷、落后的面貌。在党的民族平等政策的光辉照耀下，各民族亲密团结，友爱合作，从而消除了民族间与民族内部的隔阂和仇视，促进了他们间的巩固的团结。由于坚决贯彻执行了党和国家的关于发放贷款救济和帮助贫苦农、牧民发展生产，民族区域自治以及公平合理的贸易政策，因而使久受压迫剥削，无力生存的少数民族，逐步得到了生产上的提高和生活上的改善，各少数民族在汉族干部高度的共产主义的积极帮助下，充分实现了当家作主、管理本民族内部事务的权利。一九五八年青海地区和全国各地一样，在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，掀起了各项事业的全面大跃进，就以本省少数民族聚居的牧业区来说，在贯彻以牧为主、农牧结合发展多种经营的方针下，各种牲畜有了迅速的大量的发展，兽医防治工作取得了显著的成绩，消灭了以往危害性最大的牛瘟和控制了口蹄疫等病症，为畜牧业的跃进创造了条件。与此同时，开垦了大量的荒地，增产了更多的粮食。在兴修草原水利，灭治草原害虫，增加草原载畜量等方面也都获得了突出的成绩。在工矿业方面，如石油、铁、铅、铜、煤、盐等丰富资源，已开始开采和生产。在文化教育方面，在党的领导和帮助下，每一个公社，甚至每一个生产队都有一个或几个初级小学或高级小学，各州、县一般都建立了民族师范，或初级中学，财经、卫生、畜牧兽医等专业学校，发展了少数民族地区的文化教育及科学技术。治疗牧区人民最感痛苦的性病及其他传染病，也已取得了巨大的成绩，由于疾病减少，人口就日趋兴旺。人民公社化的实现，是一九五八年又一极其振奋人心的大好事，它不仅保证了牧业区各项生产，得到了全面跃进，而且大大提高了人民群众的社会主义觉悟，坚定了人民群众走社会主义道路的信心和决心。由于人民觉悟的提高，使草原上呈现出一片民族亲密团结，互相友爱，互相接近，互相帮助的欣欣向荣的新气象。
    西藏反动集团发动叛乱完全违背全国各民族人民的利益
    牧业区政治、经济、文化教育以及医疗卫生等方面的飞跃发展，是党的正确领导，是汉族干部大公无私的帮助而得来的。我们坚信，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，更加紧密地团结在党的周围，依靠汉族干部的帮助，就一定能使少数民族地区的各项建设得到更大更好更全面的跃进，一定能使各族人民得到更加富裕、美满的幸福生活。最近原西藏地方政府多数噶伦和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义，公然撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，发动武装叛乱，这是违背祖国统一和民族团结的滔天罪恶行为，我们表示极大的愤慨。解放几年来，西藏人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，在经济、文化、教育、卫生及民族干部的培养等方面，都得到了一定的发展。西藏广大群众衷心拥护共产党，珍视祖国统一和民族团结。而西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱，完全是违背全国人民包括西藏人民的意愿和利益的。国务院关于解散原西藏地方政府、彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令是完全正确的，我表示衷心的拥护。
    我国各族人民曾经长期经受过帝国主义的侵略，饱受过那种压迫、奴役的苦处，并且一直在中国共产党的领导下，坚持了长期的革命斗争，从而赶走了外来的帝国主义，打倒了国内的反动统治，从一九四九年、中华人民共和国成立的那一天起，那种被帝国主义和国内反动派侵略、压迫的生活宣告结束了，而且一去不复返了。现在各族人民正在紧紧地团结在党的周围，为维护祖国统一和巩固，各民族进一步团结而继续努力；正在实现着工、农、牧业生产的继续跃进和各族人民物质文化生活水平的继续提高，正在建设着更加美好的社会主义社会。今后我们更要在党的领导下，紧密地团结起来，共同建设祖国的大家庭，这样才能更好的建成社会主义并且积极准备向共产主义过渡。汉族是先进的民族，我们少数民族要跻于先进民族的行列，就必须有汉族人民的帮助，因此我们一定要更好地加强同汉族人民的团结，不断地克服和批判地方民族主义，使各民族互相友爱，互相帮助，为继续加强各民族的团结和祖国的统一作不懈的努力。
