　　Go to the Most Difficult Place
　　Gong Jie
　　Within a region, a county, a commune, or even a production team, the phenomenon of uneven work is constantly present. However, we must not fail to change it simply because it is constant; without change, it is impossible to develop work comprehensively and rapidly. Precisely because imbalance constantly occurs, we must constantly strive for balance. The method of balancing is not to block the path of advanced units, nor to level the advanced and the backward on their original basis, but to make the advanced even more advanced, and to enable the backward to catch up at an even greater speed.
　　While various objective conditions, such as the natural environment and historical circumstances, play a certain role, subjective initiative plays a vital role. From the leadership perspective, we must not neglect leadership over work in backward areas, but should regard changing the face of backward areas as a force to promote the progress of overall work.
　　Subjective initiative can be viewed from two aspects: the initiative of the masses and the initiative of the leadership. The initiative of the masses is the most fundamental force for changing the face of an area. However, without good leadership, this force is not easily brought into play. The reason why some places are backward is precisely the weakness of leadership. Just as in field management work, it is sometimes necessary to give "biased watering" and "biased fertilizing" to "Category III seedlings," it is also necessary to strengthen leadership in areas where work is relatively poor.
　　People often prefer to go to advanced communes and advanced production teams, where they can create experience to guide the overall situation. However, we should go even more to production teams where production and work are relatively backward, to the most arduous and difficult areas, where we can also create valuable experience to guide the overall situation. There, cadres can receive better training. The most important point is that the masses there need cadres the most to work hard with them, overcome difficulties, and change the face of nature. Serving the masses and creating a new happy life with the masses is the fundamental responsibility of every revolutionary cadre and their greatest joy. Many comrades in the Hengyang area deeply understand the glorious mission of revolutionary cadres. When a deputy director of a commune went to work in a team that had suffered drought for three consecutive years and had a weak economic base, he said: "Don't be afraid of backward work; as long as we work hard, things depend on human effort, and we can catch up with the advanced." These words make sense. Things depend on human effort! Didn't many of today's advanced units also develop from difficult foundations? As long as we strive for progress and strengthen leadership, backward units can quickly catch up with advanced units, and together we will advance on a more advanced and prosperous path!

### 到最困难的地方去

　　到最困难的地方去
　　龚杰
    在一个地区、一个县、一个公社，甚至一个生产队里，工作不平衡的现象是不断有的。但是，决不能因为它是不断的就不设法加以改变；不改变，就不可能使工作全面地迅速发展。正因为不断会发生不平衡，所以要经常力求平衡。平衡的方法不是挡住先进单位的去路，也不是把先进的和落后的在原有基础上拉平，而应该是使先进的更先进，使后进的以更大的速度赶上来。
    这里虽然有种种客观条件，如自然环境、历史情况等等，都起一定的作用，但是，主观能动性却起着十分重要的作用。从领导方面来讲，决不可忽视对落后地区工作的领导，而应该把改变落后地区的面貌当作推动全盘工作前进的一种力量。
    主观能动性，可以从两个方面看，即群众的能动性和领导的能动性。群众的能动性是改变一个地区的面貌的最根本的力量。可是，如果没有很好的领导，这力量就不容易发挥出来。有些地方之所以落后，原因正是领导力量薄弱。正像在田间管理工作中有时候需要对“三类苗”实行“偏水”“偏肥”一样，对工作比较差的地方，也需要分外加强领导力量。
    人们往往愿意到先进公社、先进生产队去，在那里可以创造经验，指导全面。但是，我们更应当到生产和工作都较落后的生产队去，到最艰苦最困难的地区去，在那里同样能够创造出宝贵的经验，指导全面。在那里，能使干部得到更好的锻炼。最主要的一点是：那里的群众最需要干部去和他们一起艰苦奋斗，克服困难，改变自然面貌。为群众服务，和群众一起创造新的幸福生活，是每个革命干部的根本职责，也是他们最大的愉快。衡阳地区的许多同志深刻理解革命干部的光荣任务。一位公社的副社长到一个连续三年遭干旱、经济基础薄弱的队去工作的时候说：“不怕工作落后，只要发奋努力，事在人为，就能赶上先进。”这番话说得有理。事在人为！现在的许多先进单位当初不也是在困难的基础上发展起来的吗？只要发奋图强，只要加强领导，后进单位是很快就可以赶上先进单位的，而且会共同在更加先进、更加富裕的大道上前进！
