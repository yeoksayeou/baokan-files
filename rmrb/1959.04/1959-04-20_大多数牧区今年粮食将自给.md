　　Most Pastoral Areas Will Be Self-Sufficient in Grain This Year

　　(Our report) Since the pastoral areas of Qinghai implemented people's communes, the broad masses of herdsmen have broken free from all outdated customs and habits and have vigorously promoted the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry and the construction of grassland water conservancy projects. Last year, a total of more than 1,200 water channels were built, 761 wells and springs were dug, more than 6.96 million mu of grassland were irrigated, and a total of more than 124,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, with more than 61,000 mu planted with grain crops. Some areas have even achieved self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency in grain.

　　At present, based on the great achievements made last year, herdsmen of all ethnic groups are striving for a continued great leap forward this year. In terms of agricultural production, all communes have expanded the planting area of ​​crops and livestock feed and fodder this year. The Ga'erba People's Commune plans to plant approximately 3,000 mu of grain crops and 1,500 mu of forage and feed crops this year. The Harge People's Commune in Gangcha County reclaimed 2,500 mu of wasteland last year and built one water channel. This year, it decided to reclaim 4,000 mu of wasteland and build five water channels. This commune already has 600 laborers engaged in the booming land reclamation and manure accumulation production. The Satellite and Atomic Communes of Gande County organized a land reclamation shock team of more than 1,400 people, adopting the method of softening frozen soil with cow dung to reclaim more than 2,800 mu of land. Herdsmen in Yushu County plowed all of the more than 60,000 mu of land to be planted this year in one month, and 25,000 mu were plowed twice. In the Juezhu County People’s Commune which has never grown crops before, herdsmen carrying baskets on their backs and holding manure forks can now be seen everywhere picking up manure. Gangcha County also held an agricultural training class to teach herdsmen farming techniques and agricultural knowledge. This year, the water conservancy projects built by the autonomous prefectures will be able to irrigate more than 20 million mu of grassland and reclaim and plant 210,000 mu of land (excluding small agricultural areas and immigrant reclamation). With the exception of the Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, all other autonomous prefectures will achieve self-sufficiency in grain.

　　大多数牧区今年粮食将自给
    本报讯　青海牧业区实行人民公社化以后，广大牧民冲破了一切陈规陋习的束缚，大搞农牧结合和兴修草原水利。去年共修水渠一千二百多条，打井挖泉七百六十一眼，灌溉草原六百九十六万多亩，全年共开荒十二万四千多亩，播种粮食作物六万一千多亩，有的地方并实现了粮食自给或半自给。
    目前，各族牧民正在去年取得伟大成就的基础上，争取今年继续大跃进。在农业生产上，各个公社今年都扩大了农作物和牲畜饲草、饲料的播种面积。尕坝人民公社今年计划播种约三千亩粮食作物，一千五百亩饲草、饲料作物。刚察县哈尔盖人民公社去年开垦荒地二千五百亩，兴修水渠一条，今年决定开荒四千亩，兴修水渠五条。这个公社已有六百个劳动力投入轰轰烈烈的开荒和积肥生产。甘德县卫星、原子两公社组织了一千四百多人的开荒突击队，采取用牛粪把冻土烧软的办法，开荒两千八百多亩，玉树县的牧民，在一个月内就把今年要播种的六万多亩土地全部用犁翻了一遍，并有两万五千亩翻了两遍。在过去从来没有种过庄稼的久治县解放人民公社，现在到处可以看到背着背斗、拿着粪杈的牧民在拾粪。刚察县还举办了一个农业训练班，给牧民传授耕作技术和农业知识。今年各自治州兴修的水利将可灌溉草原两千万亩以上，开荒播种二十一万亩土地（小块农业区和移民开荒不算）。除柴达木和果洛藏族自治州以外，其他各自治州都将达到粮食自给。
