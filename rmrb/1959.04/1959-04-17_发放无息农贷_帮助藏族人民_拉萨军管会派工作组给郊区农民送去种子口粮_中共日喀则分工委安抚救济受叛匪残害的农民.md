Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 16th – The Lhasa Military Control Commission recently dispatched more than ten work teams deep into the rural areas of the suburbs to help Tibetan farmers arrange spring plowing and sowing.

    More than a month ago, the bandits entrenched in the suburbs of Lhasa robbed livestock and grain everywhere, forcing farmers to participate in the rebellion, causing widespread panic, and farmers were afraid to carry out spring plowing in a timely manner. Now, on the Lhasa plain, farmers can be seen driving herds of donkeys busy transporting manure to the fields, and the sound of urging oxen to plow echoes in the peaceful fields, as women follow behind the plows to sow seeds.

    In the past, although the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet and the working personnel entering Tibet also issued interest-free seed grain to the farmers, much of the seed grain was plundered by the upper-level reactionaries. This year, the Military Control Commission directly distributed a large amount of interest-free seed grain to the farmers. According to preliminary statistics, the amount of seed grain distributed in the Lhasa area is four to five times more than last year. In Langru Xika's village of thirty-five households alone, this year they received more than 7,500 catties of loan grain, which not only provided seeds but also food.

    The personnel of the Military Control Commission's work teams also helped Tibetan farmers in Dongga Village to repair water channels, and helped residents of Dangba Village to use mutual aid and labor exchange methods to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power.

    The Tibetan farmers are very grateful to the Military Control Commission for their help and have been telling the work team members about the persecution they suffered from the former upper-level reactionary group in Tibet. Qun Da and Da Ga, residents of Dangba Village, said: The reactionary Tibetan local government has been dissolved, the reactionary rule pressing on our heads is gone, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, we are starting to live a good life. O'zhu Raojie, a 65-year-old from Bailong Qiang'an Xika, said: "I have been a beast of burden for others all my life, and my sons and daughters continue to work for others. In the past, I only thought that maybe the next life would be better, but who would have thought that I would see good days this spring." He said, "My whole family will definitely support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion and cultivate the crops well, so that we can live a happy life in our old age."

    Xinhua News Agency, Xigaze, 16th – The CCP Tibet Work Committee's Xigaze Sub-Committee recently dispatched four agricultural loan work teams along both banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River and the Nianchu River, deep into the Himalayan Mountains and Pengcuolin and other areas under the jurisdiction of the former Tibetan local government, to issue interest-free agricultural loans to farmers and poor farmers who had been looted and harmed by bandits, to help farmers carry out spring plowing and sowing. According to statistics, these four work teams have issued more than 835,800 catties of grain to more than 5,940 households of farmers in fourteen Zongxis, including Namling, Dingri, and Nadang.

    Namling Zong, north of Xigaze, was looted by bandits, and 153 households in sixteen villages were completely robbed, with a total of more than 50,000 catties of grain looted. Farmers in some areas along the banks of the Nianchu River were also harmed by the former Tibetan local government. For example, in Congdui Village, which has only nineteen households, the former Tibetan local government repeatedly issued orders and sent officials in October last year, forcing each household to send one person to become a bandit, and also ordered each household to provide two dou of qingke (highland barley), nine jin of ghee, three jin of tea, six jin of vegetable oil, thirty jin of meat, one sheng of salt, and some cash to the bandits, forcing all the farmers in the village to a dead end. After the agricultural loan work teams went deep into these areas, they comforted and expressed sympathy to the affected Tibetan farmers, and distributed relief materials such as grain and zanba (roasted barley flour) to help them arrange spring plowing production. The agricultural loan work team distributed 17,500 catties of qingke to more than 60 households of farmers in Congdui Village and Menglu Village as seed grain. The old Tibetan farmer Dawa in Congdui Village was moved to tears when he received the grain seeds. He said: "Only the Communist Party is the savior of our Tibetan people."

    At present, after receiving agricultural loans, Tibetan farmers in various places are actively transporting fertilizer to the fields, building water channels, and joyfully carrying out spring plowing and sowing. The farmers in Xialu Village recently built more than 20 li of water channels, repaired more than 30 small water channels, and transported much more fertilizer to the fields than in previous years. The time for irrigation and sowing was also several days earlier than in previous years.

    新华社拉萨16日电　拉萨市军事管制委员会最近派出十多个工作组深入到郊区农村，帮助藏族农民安排春耕播种。
    一个多月以前，盘据在拉萨市郊区的叛匪，到处拉牲口抢粮食，强迫农民参加叛乱，弄得人心惶惶，农民不敢及时进行春耕生产。现在，拉萨平原上每天都可以看到农民赶着成群的毛驴忙着向地里送粪，宁静的田野上响起了?喝耕牛的声音，妇女们跟在犁后撒下种子。
    往年，人民解放军驻藏部队和进藏工作人员虽然也向农民发放了不计息的种粮，但有许多种粮被上层反动分子掠夺走了。今年军管会直接向农民发放了大量无息种粮。据初步统计，在拉萨地区发放的种粮比去年要多四、五倍。仅朗如溪卡的一个村子三十五户人家，今年就得到了七千五百多斤贷粮，不但有了种子，也有了口粮。
    军管会工作组人员还帮助东噶村藏族农民修水渠，帮助当巴村居民采用互助、变工的方法，解决劳力、畜力不足的困难。
    藏族农民非常感激军管会对他们的帮助，纷纷向工作组人员诉说从前西藏上层反动集团对他们的迫害。当巴村的居民群达和达噶说：反动的西藏地方政府被解散了，压在我们头上的反动统治没有了，在共产党的领导下，我们开始过好日子。白龙羌岸溪卡六十五岁的俄珠绕结说：“我给人家当了一辈子牛马，我的儿子女儿又继续为人家劳动，过去只想来生也许会好起来，谁想今年春天就见到好日子了。”他说：“我全家一定好好支援人民解放军平息叛乱，种好庄稼，在晚年过一过幸福生活。”
    新华社日喀则16日电　中共西藏工委日喀则分工委最近派出四个农贷工作组，沿着雅鲁藏布江和年楚河两岸，深入到属于原西藏地方政府管辖的喜马拉雅山区和彭错林等地区，向曾经遭到叛匪抢掠残害的农民和贫苦农民发放无息农贷，帮助农民进行春耕播种。据统计，这四个工作组已经向那木林、定日、那当等十四个宗溪的五千九百四十多户农民，发放了八十三万五千八百多斤粮食。
    日喀则北面的那木林宗，曾遭到叛匪的抢劫，其中有十六个村子的一百五十三户农民被抢掠一空，共被抢走粮食五万多斤。年楚河两岸一些地区的农民也受到了原西藏地方政府的残害。如只有十九户人家的丛堆村，去年10月间原西藏地方政府就曾经几次下令和派来官员，强迫每家出一个人去当叛匪，还勒令每户人家要拿出两斗青稞、九斤酥油、三斤茶叶、六斤菜油、三十斤肉、一升食盐和一部分现金给叛匪，逼得全村农民走投无路。农贷工作组深入到这些地区以后，向受害的藏族农民进行了安抚和慰问，并给他们发放了粮食、糌粑等救济物资，帮助他们安排了春耕生产。农贷工作组给丛堆村和梦鲁村的六十多户农民发放了一万七千五百斤青稞当种粮，丛堆村的藏族老农民达哇接到粮种后感激得流泪了。他说：“只有共产党才是我们藏族人民的救星。”
    目前，各地藏族农民在得到农贷以后，正在积极地向地里运送肥料，兴修水渠，欢天喜地地进行春耕播种。夏鲁村农民最近兴修了二十多里长的水渠，整修了三十多条小水渠，运往地里的肥料比往年大大增多，灌水和播种时间也比往年提早了几天。
