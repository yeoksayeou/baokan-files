Strive to Leave No Land Idle
Hu Jian

In Hunan Province, while mobilizing the broad masses of commune members to collectively cultivate early-maturing crops such as melons and vegetables, people's communes in various localities are also mobilizing commune members to plant melons and vegetables on the scattered plots of land near their homes, striving to leave no land idle. This practice is worth promoting.

As the saying goes, "Grains of rice fill a basket, drops of water form a river." Planting a few melon and bean seedlings on one or two scattered pieces of land may seem like an insignificant "small matter." However, when accumulated from a team or a commune, it amounts to a considerable income. According to a recent calculation by the Nan Hong People's Commune in Nanxian County, the total area of scattered land in the commune is more than 6,000 mu. If all of it is planted with vegetables, the annual output could reach more than 300,000 dan. After providing each of the more than 40,000 people in the commune with 1.5 jin of fresh vegetables per day, nearly 70,000 dan could still be supplied to the market.

"No land left idle" is a good habit of diligent and thrifty farming among Chinese farmers. For many years, farmers have always used their spare time from field labor to plant melons, beans, vegetables, and oilseeds on field ridges, pond banks, roadsides, beside houses, and on vacant plots. This not only supplemented food and vegetables, increased pig feed, but also compensated for the shortage of oilseeds. This is a good thing that requires little labor, occupies little land, and yields multiple benefits. This should continue after communization. Although the production of people's communes is more collectivized than that of the past agricultural cooperatives, it is not necessary to have all the overly scattered land by the roadside and beside houses managed by the commune and its production teams. The production plans of the commune and production teams should only include the main aspects, the large aspects. As for those scattered plots of land, commune members should be mobilized to manage them. They are very clear about the conditions of the scattered land and know where it is suitable to plant what crops. When people's communes in various parts of Hunan Province sow early-maturing crops such as melons and vegetables, in addition to assigning specific vegetable production tasks to canteens and work groups and implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" system, each production team also allows commune members to use their spare time to plant melons and vegetables on small open spaces in front of and behind their houses, provided that it does not affect collective production. Moreover, it is stipulated that the income shall be handled by the commune members themselves. These methods are correct. They not only take the collective production of the commune and team as a prerequisite, but also fully exploit the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and the potential of the land, adding a great deal of material wealth to society, greatly developing production for the commune and production team, and increasing income for the commune members themselves. It is indeed a win-win situation.

    力求寸土不闲
    胡坚
    湖南省各地人民公社在发动广大社员集体经营瓜菜等早熟作物的同时，也发动社员在宅旁的零星土地上种上瓜菜，力争寸土不闲。这种作法是值得提倡的。
    常言说：“粒米成箩，滴水成河。”一块两块零星隙地，栽几兜瓜菜豆角，看来好像是无关紧要的“小事”。可是，一个队一个公社聚起来，就是一笔不小的收入。南县南红人民公社最近计算，全社的零星隙地，合起来有六千多亩。如果全部种菜，年产可达三十多万担；除全社四万多人每人每天吃一斤半鲜菜外，还可以有将近七万担供应市场。
    “寸土不闲”，是我国农民勤俭耕作的好习惯。多少年来，农民总是利用田间劳动的空闲时间，在田塍塘坎、路边宅旁、空坪隙地种瓜种豆种菜种油料，不仅添补了口粮和蔬菜，增加了养猪饲料，还能补油料之不足。这是一件花工不多、占地不大、一举数得的好事情。公社化以后还应该继续这样作。人民公社的生产虽然同过去农业社比起来集体化的程度更高，但是并没有也不必要把路边、宅旁过于零星的土地统统由公社和它的生产队经营。公社和生产队的生产计划，只能包括主要的方面，大的方面。至于那些零星土地，应该发动社员去经营。他们对零星土地的情况摸得很清楚，知道在什么地方宜于种点儿什么作物。湖南各地人民公社在播种瓜菜等早熟作物的时候，各个生产队除对食堂、作业组布置了一定的生产蔬菜的任务，实行了“三包一奖”制度外，并在不影响集体生产的原则下，允许社员利用工余时间，在屋前屋后的小块空地上种瓜菜，而且规定收益归社员自己处理。这些办法是正确的，它既以搞好社、队的集体生产为前提，又充分地发挥了广大社员的积极性和土地的潜力，对社会来说增加了许多物质财富，对公社和生产队说更大地发展了生产，对社员个人说又增加了收入，的确是一举数得。
