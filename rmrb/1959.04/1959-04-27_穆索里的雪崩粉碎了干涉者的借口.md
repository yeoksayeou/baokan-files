Mussoorie Avalanche Shatters Interventionists' Excuses

Critical Issue Clarified, Excuses Vanish
Editor:

    After the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" was published, although we had ample reason to explain that this statement was imposed on the Dalai Lama by others, the fanatical Indian expansionists took it as a weapon to launch an attack on our country. They said that this was the manifestation of the Dalai Lama's "free will," but they resolutely adopted a negative attitude towards the three letters written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan before leaving Lhasa, which were completely contrary to the attitude of this so-called statement, insisting that we had "fabricated" them.

    However, Nehru's talks with the Dalai Lama in Mussoorie on the 24th completely eliminated the excuses for this distortion of facts and confusion of right and wrong, and the frantic attacks and slanders against our country launched on this basis. No one can deny that the letters written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan are genuine.

    This ironclad fact loudly tells people: What exactly is the Dalai Lama's "free will"? Was the Dalai Lama kidnapped by reactionaries, or did he go to India "voluntarily"? And who is manipulating the so-called statement published in India that is incompatible with these three letters? No one can be fooled anymore!

    Indian expansionists: You can shut up! The truth has been revealed, the excuse has collapsed, and how much real value can your so frantic slander and defamation have, other than making you a laughingstock?

Those Suffering from Brain Fever Can Wake Up
Editor:

    Your newspaper published an important news item on the 26th, reporting that after Indian Prime Minister Nehru met with the Dalai Lama on the 24th, he admitted that the three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan were genuine. Prime Minister Nehru's confirmation of this critical issue is welcome.

    The expansionists in India will certainly see their own Prime Minister's remarks earlier than I do. I think it is now appropriate to ask these gentlemen who are dizzy with excitement, now, shouldn't your minds be a little calmer and clearer! For so many days, haven't you been painstakingly trying to make people believe that the Dalai Lama left "voluntarily" and was not kidnapped? Haven't you been trying every possible way to deny that the so-called statement of the Dalai Lama was imposed on him by others? Haven't you been incoherently slandering our Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's statement about the Dalai Lama being kidnapped as a "Himalayan lie"? Gentlemen, now you don't need others to waste their breath, you can directly find the answer from your own Prime Minister.

    Your Prime Minister admits that the Dalai Lama's three letters are genuine, and your Prime Minister's remarks are of course also genuine (I have no doubt about this at all). Genuine letters, genuine remarks, these two genuineness alone are enough to cure your brain fever and stop your daydreaming.

    Of course, it is inevitable that there will still be some people who are unwilling to listen to the truth from their own government leaders, and would rather let their minds continue to be dizzy and continue to daydream. There is nothing that can be done about this! However, the vast majority of people in the world, including the vast majority of Indians, believe in facts and believe in the truth. They will rise up to oppose this small handful of expansionists in India and oppose all remarks and actions that attempt to continue to interfere in China's internal affairs and split China's unity and solidarity.

    In fact, I would also like to advise the Indian expansionists: you better be a little smarter and quickly throw away this tattered inheritance you picked up from British imperialism into the Indian Ocean!

A Loud Slap in the Face for Indian Expansionists
Editor:

    We are extremely indignant at the actions of Indian expansionists who openly interfere in our country's internal affairs by using the rebellion of reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet as an excuse. Since the Tibetan rebellion occurred, in order to satisfy their ambitions for expansion, they have disregarded the universally recognized historical fact that Tibet is an inalienable part of China, disregarded the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, saying that the rebellion of reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet was an "uprising"; slandering our suppression of the rebellion as "aggression"; saying that Chinese and Tibetans are different; that Tibet should be independent, etc. They have also colluded with the rebel elements who fled to India to fabricate two so-called statements of the Dalai Lama, plotting to use these two so-called statements to wantonly slander our country, and even systematically organized demonstrations in front of our consulate in Mumbai, insulting the image of our great leader Chairman Mao. Recently, some party leaders in India who do not know Mount Tai have gathered to clamor that India cannot stand idly by while our country puts down the Tibetan rebellion, and their arrogance is even more rampant. However, just as these expansionists were daydreaming, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, after meeting with the Dalai Lama on the 24th of this month, had to admit that the three letters written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan after the Tibetan separatist group launched a rebellion were genuine, which proved with ironclad facts that the Dalai Lama was indeed kidnapped. From this, it can be seen that the so-called two statements of the Dalai Lama were imposed on him by others. This is truly a loud slap in the face for Indian expansionists. Their excuse has completely failed. We warn the Indian expansionists that if they do not immediately rein in their horses and dare to continue to provoke the 650 million Chinese people who have stood up, they will surely suffer an even more shameful defeat.

### 穆索里的雪崩粉碎了干涉者的借口

    穆索里的雪崩粉碎了干涉者的借口
    关键问题大白借口化为乌有编辑同志：
    在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”发表以后，虽然我们有充分的理由说明这个声明是别人强加于达赖喇嘛的，但是狂热的印度扩张主义分子却把它当成了对我国发动进攻的武器，他们说，这是达赖喇嘛“自由意志”的表现，而对于和这个所谓声明态度截然相反的达赖喇嘛在离开拉萨前写给谭冠三将军的三封信，却断然采取了否定的态度，硬说是我们“捏造”的。
    但是，尼赫鲁和达赖喇嘛24日在穆索里举行谈话后，使这一颠倒黑白、混淆是非的胡说，和在这一基础上展开的对我国的疯狂攻击和诬蔑，完全失去了借口。任何人也不得不承认达赖喇嘛写给谭冠三将军的信是真实的。
    这个铁一般的事实响亮地告诉人们：究竟什么是达赖喇嘛的“自由意志”？达赖喇嘛是被反动分子劫走的，还是“自愿”到印度去的？而在印度发表的和这三封信格格不入的那个所谓声明究竟是什么人在玩弄把戏，再也骗不了人了！
    印度扩张主义分子们：你们可以住口了！真相已经大白，借口已经崩溃，而你们如此疯狂的诬蔑和诽谤，除了贻人笑柄外，又能有多少真正价值呢？

    害脑热症的人们可以清醒了编辑同志：
    26日你报发表了一条重要新闻，报道说印度总理尼赫鲁24日会见达赖喇嘛后，承认达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信是真的。尼赫鲁总理对这一关键性问题的证实，是值得欢迎的。
    印度的扩张主义分子当然会比我更早地看到他们自己总理的谈话。我想，现在不妨问问这些头脑热昏的先生们，这一下，你们的脑子总该冷静一点、清醒一点了吧！多少日子以来，你们不是在煞费苦心地硬要人们相信达赖喇嘛是“自愿”出走而不是被劫持的吗？你们不是在千方百计地否认所谓达赖喇嘛的声明是别人强加于他的吗？你们不是在语无伦次地诬蔑我国周恩来总理关于达赖喇嘛被劫持的说法是“喜马拉雅山似的谎言”吗？先生们，现在不需要别人来多费唇舌，你们可以就近从你们自己总理那里直接找到回答了。
    你们总理承认达赖喇嘛的三封信是真的，你们总理的谈话当然也是真的（我丝毫不怀疑这一点），真的信，真的谈话，单单这两个真的，就很可以治治你们的脑热症，使你们停止白日梦呓。
    当然，难免还会有这么一些人，连自己国家的政府首脑的实话也不愿听，宁愿让自己的头脑继续热昏下去，继续白日梦呓下去，这是没有办法的事情！但是，世界上绝大多数人，包括绝大多数印度人，是相信事实，相信真理的，他们会起来反对印度这一小撮扩张主义分子，反对一切企图继续干涉中国内政和分裂中国统一团结的言论和行动。
    其实呢——我还想奉劝印度扩张主义分子一句，你们还是自己聪敏一点好，赶快把你们这套从英国帝国主义那里捡来的破烂衣钵扔到印度洋里去吧！

    打了印度扩张主义分子一记响亮的耳光编辑同志：
    我们对印度扩张主义分子借西藏上层反动分子叛乱事件，公然干涉我国内政的行为，极为愤慨。自从西藏叛乱事件发生后，他们为了扩张的野心，不顾全世界所公认的历史事实——西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，不顾中印两国人民的友谊和五项原则，说什么西藏上层反动分子的叛乱是“起义”；污蔑我国平息叛乱是“侵略”；说中国人和西藏人不同；西藏应独立等等，并伙同逃往印度的叛乱分子制造两次所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，阴谋利用这两个所谓声明，对我国肆意进行污蔑，甚至有计划地在我国驻孟买领事馆门前组织游行示威，污辱我国伟大的领袖毛主席的像。近日印度更有一些有眼不识泰山的政党领袖集会叫嚷什么印度对我国平定西藏叛乱不能袖手旁观，气焰更为嚣张。但是正当这些扩张主义分子白日做梦的时候，印度总理尼赫鲁在本月24日和达赖喇嘛会谈后，不得不承认达赖在西藏叛国集团发动叛乱之后给谭冠三将军写的三封信是真实的，这就用铁一般的事实证明达赖喇嘛确实是被劫持的。由此可见所谓达赖喇嘛的两次声明，是别人强加于他的，这真是打了印度扩张主义分子一个响亮的耳光。他们的借口是完全破产了。我们警告印度扩张主义分子，如果不立即悬崖勒马，胆敢向站了起来的六亿五千万中国人民继续挑衅，必定遭到更可耻的失败。　北京仪器厂全体职工
