Visiting Lu Xun's Tomb and Former Residence

    I. Willows in the gentle breeze, magnolias blooming, the south of the Yangtze River enjoys a bright sunny day. Whether lying in eternal rest or sitting upright, he exudes a sense of ease and elegance, his homeland forever young.
    II. His life of struggle is admired by the world. In those years, his eagerness in the sea of education was profound. He displayed true courage in the thicket of knives and wisdom, and his willingness to be a "willing ox" revealed great benevolence.
    III.  Talking about the rights and wrongs of the world all day long, his piercing gaze reflected the setting sun. His writing brush swept with the force of a thousand jun, and even amidst the chaos of war, he still raised his eyebrows in defiance.
    IV. Twenty years later, revisiting brings a sense of renewal. The lingering sound of his voice still echoes. A child at the table looks back, his love overflowing. (I visited Mr. Lu Xun in April 1936, when the essays written during the time of refuge were published in the newspaper. Hai Ying was by his side, and Mr. Lu Xun often stroked his head.) Shanghai, March 21, 1959.

   This is the nineteenth illustration in A Geng's "Dead Souls" series. This image depicts the scene described by Lu Xun in his essay "An Almost Eventless Tragedy":  Nozdryov, a local bully-like landowner, loves to join in the fun, gamble, tell big lies, and seek flattery – but doesn't mind being beaten either. He meets Chichikov in a hotel, showing off his good little dog, ordering Chichikov to touch the dog's ears, and then its nose. Gogol uses ordinary events and ordinary words to profoundly reveal the landlords' dull lives at the time. The fat fellow sitting in the chair is Chichikov.

    谒鲁迅墓并访故居　　　
　　李霁野
    一垂柳和风绽玉兰，江南正值艳阳天。长眠端坐皆潇洒，故国青春万万年。
    二奋战生平世所钦，当年教海意殷殷。刀丛斗智显真勇，俯首为牛见大仁。
    三竟日长谈万事非，目光炯炯映斜辉。毛锥纵扫千钧力，离乱声中尚横眉。
    四廿载重来万象新，绕梁犹记旧时音。桌前稚子回眸顾，慈爱殷殷一片心。（一九三六年四月访先生，适当日报纸刊出避难时所写杂文。时海婴在侧，先生时以手抚其首。）一九五九、三、二十一、上海（附图片）
   这是阿庚的“死魂灵”插图中第十九幅。这个图是鲁迅在“几乎无事的悲剧”一文中所描写的那个场面：罗士特来夫，是地方恶少式的地主，赶热闹，爱赌博，撒大谎，要恭维，——但挨打也不要紧。他在酒店里遇到乞乞科夫，夸示自己的好小狗，勒令乞乞科夫摸过狗耳朵之后，还要摸鼻子。果戈里用平常事，平常话，深刻地显出当时地主的无聊生活。坐在椅子上的那个胖家伙就是乞乞科夫。
