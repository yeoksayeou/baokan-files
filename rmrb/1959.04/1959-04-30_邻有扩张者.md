    A Neighbor with Expansionist Ambitions
    Wei Chuantong

    A neighbor with expansionist ambitions, how hot is their head; continuing the dark legacy of the British, the methods are too clumsy. Looking up, the haze is heavy; looking down, the snow before the door. Quickly take a cooling agent, lest people ridicule you as a fool. If evil thoughts are not restrained, you will be ruined and discredited. Rein in the horse at the cliff's edge, do not follow the path of the Axis.

    邻有扩张者
    魏传统邻有扩张者，头脑何其热；继英黑遗产，手法太拙劣。仰瞻阴霾重，俯视门前雪。速服清凉剂，免人讥笨伯。邪念不收敛，身败而名裂。悬崖须勒马，勿蹈轴心辙。
