    Quickly Send Good Iron to Key Steel Plants
    Shandong's External Transfer of Pig Iron is All Up to Standard; Sichuan Transfers 320,000 Tons of Good Iron to Support Chongqing Iron and Steel
    Anhui Transfers Out More Than 65,000 Tons of Good Iron; Shijingshan Iron and Steel Transfers High-Quality Pig Iron to Support Mechanical Departments
    This newspaper's Jinan dispatch on the 28th – Shandong Province is continuously shipping large quantities of high-quality pig iron to Shanghai and other places. From April 1st to 21st, it has transferred 30,782 tons of pig iron, an increase of 21.4% compared to the same period last month.
    Under the guidance of the ideology of "external before internal" and "sending good iron to large steel plants," workers on the steel front in Shandong Province enthusiastically launched a red banner competition for high output and high quality, fiercely attacking high sulfur content, ensuring that all externally transferred pig iron is up to standard, with sulfur content between 0.05% and 0.2%, changing the situation in March when only 80% of the iron was up to standard.
    In order to transport large quantities of pig iron to Shanghai and other places in a timely manner, Shandong and relevant prefectural and municipal party committees have established commanding headquarters for rushing the transportation of pig iron, specifically organizing manpower and vehicles to ensure the timely external transfer of pig iron.
    Recently, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee again notified local and municipal party committees, requiring them to transfer all the qualified iron they produce to Shanghai and other places. The Provincial Party Committee also required the secretaries in charge of industry in various localities to personally take charge, treating the external transfer of pig iron as an important political task to be completed.

    This newspaper's Chongqing dispatch on the 28th – From January to April 20th this year, 13 special districts in Sichuan Province, including Dazhou, Jiangjin, and Wanxian, have transferred more than 320,000 tons of pig iron to support the steelmaking needs of key units such as Chongqing Iron and Steel Company.
    More than ten special districts in Sichuan Province that are responsible for supporting several key steel plants with pig iron are all led by industrial secretaries, with designated personnel responsible for scheduling, daily inspections, and the implementation of "five determinations" (determining leaders, tools, points and lines, time, and tasks). They have established professional transportation teams, adjusted transportation routes, and connected long-distance, short-distance, branch lines, trunk lines, vehicles, ships, and civilian transportation tools to ensure that everything is transported as soon as it is produced, without losing a single jin, and that it is delivered to key steel plants on time and in the correct quantity. In Luzhou Special District, many district party committee secretaries and commune party committee secretaries took the lead in transporting iron; the entire district mobilized 120 vehicles, more than 3,000 ships and wooden boats, and since February, has overfulfilled the task of pig iron transfer every ten days. Dazhou Special District formed a short-distance professional transportation team, vigorously promoted the construction of "one network and fourizations" (transportation network, vehicle-ization, rail-ization, chute-ization, cableway-ization), and built 320 wooden tracks, 534 car tracks, and 300 kilometers of chutes and cableways in 59 mining areas and furnace groups throughout the district, greatly saving labor; at the same time, after adjusting wooden boat transportation, strengthening automobile repair and highway maintenance, building new wooden boats and dredging waterways, the transportation in the entire district became more rational, forming a complete and tight system, enabling the external transfer of pig iron to be carried out on time.
    This newspaper's Hefei dispatch on the 28th – After transferring more than 250,000 tons of pig iron in the first quarter, Anhui Province transferred another 65,800 tons of pig iron from April 1st to 22nd, an increase of 13.5% compared to the same period last month.
    The leadership in Anhui Province attaches great importance to the external transfer of pig iron, requiring leaders at all levels to grasp and handle it firmly at each level. Since mid-April, the province has produced more than 4,800 tons of iron per day, while the external transfer of pig iron has reached more than 3,800 tons, with a maximum of 4,800 tons. In order to ensure the completion of the external transfer task in terms of quality and quantity, in April, the province also implemented a method of item-by-item review and special approval for iron use within the province, which greatly reduced iron use within the province and promptly supported key steel plants.
    Many places in Anhui also regard the external transfer of pig iron as one of the contents of the comparison and competition, and the result of the comparison is that it has greatly promoted the progress of the external transfer work. Workers in many factories have put forward the slogan "produce more today, transfer more tomorrow," and transportation workers have universally launched a "four fast" competition of unloading fast, stacking fast, weighing fast, and loading fast. Ma'anshan City conducts daily inspections of the external transfer situation, and if it finds that the quantity transferred on that day does not meet the requirements, it will find ways to make up for it the next day, resolutely ensuring that not a single jin is missing.
    In recent days, many steel plant workers have launched a struggle against high sulfur and high phosphorus, so that the proportion of sulfur and phosphorus has continued to decline. When leaving the factory, they also patiently carry out careful selection to ensure that pig iron that does not meet the specifications is not transferred out. Ma'anshan City separately stacks pig iron of different qualities and transports them separately according to the needs of the user departments, which has been welcomed by various places. In this way, the steelmaking and qualification rate of pig iron transferred to various places in the province reached 93%-95%. (Chen Chongfa)
    This newspaper reports that Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company completed the pig iron transfer plan for January to April this year on time, in quantity, and in quality. As of April 21, it had transferred 91,000 tons of high-quality pig iron to 115 units across the country in accordance with the order contract.
    In its work, this company conscientiously implemented the national unified planning principle and resolutely implemented the orders from higher authorities. In March, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, it transferred more than 4,000 tons of pig iron to factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building ahead of schedule in order to rush the production of six major pieces of equipment.
    In organizing production, this company strictly followed the order contract for production. In March, the original plan was to produce a higher output of steelmaking pig iron, but later, according to the needs, the higher authorities instructed them to increase the quantity of foundry pig iron transferred. After receiving the instructions, the company's party committee immediately held a meeting to discuss that although the change of varieties would reduce the production of pig iron by about 400 tons, the company still resolutely adjusted the production variety plan in the spirit of external before internal.
    In order to ship pig iron in a timely manner, under the condition that the transportation task was relatively tight, the staff of the transportation department launched a competition to overcome difficulties and load and dispatch vehicles in a timely manner. Since April, they have basically shipped them evenly every day, changing the previous situation of being loose in the front and tight in the back. The deputy manager of this company in charge of supply and marketing checks the transfer of pig iron every day, and the company's party committee has also conducted several special inspections, which have played a major role in ensuring the completion of the iron transfer task.

    快把好铁送到重点钢厂
    山东外调生铁质量全部合格　四川调好铁三十二万吨支援重钢
    安徽调出好铁六万五千多吨　石钢调拨优质生铁支援机械部门
    本报济南28日电　山东省把大批质量优良的生铁源源运往上海等地从4月1日到21日已外调三万零七百八十二吨生铁，比上月同期增长了21.4％。
    山东省在“先外后内”，“把好铁送到大钢铁厂去”等思想指导下，全省钢铁战线上的职工们热烈地开展高产优质的红旗竞赛运动，猛攻高硫，使外调生铁的质量全部合格，含硫都在0.05％—0.2％之间，改变了3月份只有80％合格铁的局面。
    为了及时地把大量生铁运往上海等地，山东和有关地委、市委都成立了抢运生铁指挥部，具体组织人力、车辆，保证生铁及时外运。
    最近，中共山东省委又通知各地、市委，要求他们把生产的合格铁全部外调上海等地。省委还要求各地管工业的书记要亲自挂帅，把生铁外调工作当做一项重要的政治任务来完成。　（孙静）
    本报重庆28日电　今年1月到4月20日止，四川省达县、江津、万县等十三个专区已调运了三十二万多吨生铁支援了重庆钢铁公司等重点单位炼钢需要。
    四川省担负支援几个重点钢厂生铁任务的十多个专区都由工业书记挂帅，指定专人负责，排好进度表，逐日检查，并实行定领导、定工具、定点线、定时间、定任务等“五定”办法，建立了专业运输队伍，调整了运输路线，把长短途、支干线以及车船和民间运输工具互相衔接起来，做到随产随运，一斤不缺，确保按质按量运到重点炼钢厂。泸州专区许多区委书记、公社党委书记，带头运铁；全区出动了一百二十辆汽车、三千多只轮船和木船，2月份以来，旬旬超额完成了生铁调运任务。达县专区组成了短途专业运输队，大搞“一网四化”建设（交通运输网、车子化、轨道化、梭槽化、索道化），在全区五十九个矿区、炉群内修了木轨道三百二十条、架车道五百三十四条、梭槽、索道三百公里，大大节约了劳动力；同时调整了木船的运输，加强汽车修理和公路养护、新造木船与航道整治等工作后，使全区的交通运输更加合理，结成一个完整、严密的体系，使外调生铁能够按时调出。
    本报合肥28日电　安徽省继第一季度外调生铁二十五万多吨以后，4月1日到22日止，全省又已调出生铁六万五千八百多吨，比上月同期增长13.5％。
    安徽省领导方面对外调生铁工作极为重视，要求各级领导，层层抓紧、抓狠。本月中旬以来，全省每天出铁四千八百多吨，而外调生铁达三千八百多吨，最高达四千八百吨。为了保证按质按量完成外调任务，4月份，对省内用铁还实行了逐项审核专案批拨的办法，这样就大大压缩了省内用铁，及时支援了重点钢厂。
    安徽不少地方还把外调生铁工作作为评比竞赛的内容之一，评比的结果，是大大地推动了外调工作的进度。许多厂的职工都提出了“今天多产，明天多调”的口号，运输职工普遍开展了卸得快、堆得快、过磅快、装得快的“四快”竞赛。马鞍山市逐日对外调情况进行检查，发现当天调出数量达不到要求时，第二天就想办法补齐，坚决做到一斤不少。
    连日来，许多钢铁厂的职工，都向高硫、高磷开展了斗争，使硫、磷比例不断下降。在出厂时，他们还耐心地进行精选，做到不符合规格标准的生铁不调出。马鞍山市把不同质量的生铁分别堆放，根据使用部门的需要分别进行调运，受到了各地的欢迎。这样，全省调往各地的生铁，炼钢和合格率达到93％—95％。
                      （陈崇发）
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司按时、按量、按质完成了今年1至4月的生铁调拨计划。到4月21日为止，已按照订货合同调拨给全国一百一十五个单位九万一千吨优质生铁。
    这个公司在工作中认真贯彻了全国一盘棋的方针，坚决执行上级的调令。3月份根据冶金工业部的指示，把四千多吨生铁提前调拨给第一机械工业部所属工厂，以便赶制六大设备。
    这个公司在组织生产中，严格地按照订货合同进行生产。3月份原计划生产炼钢生铁的产量较高，后来上级根据需要指示他们增加调拨铸造生铁的数量。公司党委得到指示后，马上开会讨论，虽然由于品种改变要少生产四百吨左右的生铁，但是公司还是本着先外后内的精神，坚决地调整了生产品种计划。
    为了及时发出生铁，在运输任务比较紧张的情况下，运输部的职工展开竞赛，克服困难，及时装车发车，从4月份起，基本上每天均衡发运，改变了过去前松后紧的情况。这个公司主管供销工作的副经理每天都检查调拨生铁的情况，公司党委还进行了几次专门的检查，这对保证完成调铁任务，起了重大的作用。　（徐炳忠）
