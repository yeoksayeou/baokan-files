　　Spring Ploughing and Sowing: Time is of the Essence
　　Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Calls for Centering Current Work on Spring Ploughing and Sowing
　　Sichuan Concentrates Manpower, Materials and Financial Resources to Strengthen the Agricultural Production Front

　　(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th dispatch) The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a radio mobilization meeting on April 5 to launch a large-scale spring ploughing and sowing production campaign, calling on all localities to make spring ploughing and sowing the overriding center of all rural work.

　　With the Qingming Festival passed, spring ploughing and sowing in Jiangsu is very intense. Of the province's more than 28 million mu of spring fields, more than 6 million mu of corn and sorghum are being sown, and more than 22 million mu of early rice, early soybeans, spring sweet potatoes, rice, cotton, spring peanuts, hemp, tobacco, and sugar beets must be planted and cultivated well between Qingming and the Beginning of Summer. This month or so is a crucial period for determining a bumper harvest in agricultural production for the whole year. Seizing the agricultural season, doing a good job in spring sowing, and getting a good start for the autumn harvest is a major battle to strive for a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.

　　Provincial Party Secretary Liu Shunyuan, after analyzing the more favorable conditions for this year's spring ploughing and sowing compared to the past at the radio conference, requested that all localities must focus on solving the following four issues:

　　First, we must rationally adjust the crop layout. The crop layout of the people's communes must ensure the completion of the state plan. Under this prerequisite, all localities should implement rational planting in accordance with local conditions. Wherever the original plans were too detailed or inflexible, or where the variety layout between teams is unreasonable, the communes and production brigades should be allowed to make some appropriate adjustments. When arranging planting plans, people's communes should pay attention to developing high-yield crops, expanding the area of rice and peanuts, and make specific arrangements for small miscellaneous grains and small cash crops to meet the needs of industrial production and commune members' lives. The crop layout must be fully discussed by commune members, listen to the opinions of the majority, and then be assigned to teams, groups, and fields. This year's output targets, procurement tasks, income distribution, and "three guarantees and one reward" schemes should be submitted to commune members for discussion and quickly determined, so that commune members understand how much they will harvest, how much they will distribute, and how much they will eat.

　　Second, the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture must be fully implemented. When sowing crops, rational close planting is a central link. Local and county party committees must seriously check the close planting plans of each commune and production brigade, adhere to rational close planting, and prevent excessive close planting. The specifications for close planting must be repeatedly discussed with the masses.

　　Third, while carrying out spring ploughing and sowing, we must also grasp the late-stage management of summer crops and the production of vegetables, livestock, and poultry. Judging from the current situation, summer crops are growing well, and a bumper harvest is promising. However, we must not be complacent or slack, because the season of multiple disasters for summer crops has just begun. Lodging, spring frost, drought, waterlogging, diseases, and insect pests will seriously threaten the bumper harvest of summer crops. For overly dense wheat, we must focus on preventing lodging and quickly take measures to break the "cherish the seedlings" mentality. Those that should be thinned should be thinned, those that should be ditched should be ditched, and those that should be thinned should be thinned to ensure ventilation and light.

　　Fourth, labor must be comprehensively and rationally arranged and used. First of all, we must meet the needs of agricultural production, especially during the busy season of spring ploughing and sowing, when the vast majority of rural labor should be used for agricultural production. The labor used in agricultural production during this period should account for at least 80% to 85% or more of the total rural labor force. The labor used for other tasks must be reduced to a minimum. Party committees at all levels should comprehensively arrange labor according to the principle of ensuring key tasks and taking care of general tasks. At the same time, we must focus on tool innovation to improve labor efficiency. Establish and improve various production responsibility systems, universally implement work evaluation and scorekeeping, and implement more work, more pay.

　　The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to postpone or suspend any work that conflicts with spring ploughing and sowing. In addition to retaining the necessary personnel to maintain daily work, the majority of cadres in leading organs at all levels should go deep down, eat, live, and work with commune members, and guide production while participating in production. The main responsible cadres of the Party Committee should go deeper, conduct key inspections, discover problems, and solve problems, and must not only listen to reports and look at statements.

　　At the radio conference, many county party secretaries and commune party committee secretaries expressed their determination to respond to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and ensure that spring ploughing and sowing tasks are completed on time and with quality and quantity.

　　(Our newspaper, Chengdu, 9th dispatch) Sichuan has concentrated its main manpower, material resources, and financial resources to strengthen the front line of agricultural production, in order to push spring ploughing and sowing to a new climax.

　　Sichuan made arrangements at the end of March to fight a big battle in April and comprehensively advance towards agriculture. The province, prefectures, counties, and districts have dispatched 80,000 cadres to the countryside to participate in and lead production. Except for one secretary and a few members of the local and county party committees to manage industry and finance, other leading comrades have invested in agricultural production.

　　In order to ensure that there is sufficient labor for spring ploughing and sowing, all localities have re-arranged labor and tapped potential in many ways. Wenjiang Prefecture made careful calculations, arranged at all levels, and inspected at all levels, adding 400,000 laborers to the current agricultural production. Wanxian Prefecture also added 120,000 strong laborers to the agricultural front. Other prefectures have also drawn excessive labor from welfare and community-run industries and invested them in agricultural production, mobilized urban residents to support production, and tried to reduce the number of non-production personnel in communes. At present, the main labor force used for agricultural production in each prefecture is above 70%. On secondary production fronts, the general practice is to replace the strong with the weak and women with men, and to draw strong labor to engage in agricultural production.

　　Financial and material resources are also prioritized to meet the needs of agricultural production. By mid-March, the province had issued more than 90 million yuan in agricultural loans (more than double the same period last year), and the poverty alleviation cooperative fund loans recovered last year will all be transferred as state investment in the commune, and more than 80 million yuan of preparatory deposits for wheat, rapeseed, and other crops will be allocated to each commune in advance. The communes in various places used these loans and advance payments to purchase large quantities of agricultural tools, pesticides, fertilizers, and seeds. More production materials than in previous years are being rushed to the front line of agricultural production day and night. The supply teams organized by the commercial departments are very active on the production front. In addition to actively organizing the supply of various production materials and daily necessities, they also go deep into the communes and production teams to assist in formulating plans, solving raw materials and technical problems, and manufacturing production materials on the spot. In Mianyang Prefecture alone, more than 1,500 employees of the commercial departments of eight counties are regularly active in various communes. By March, the province's commercial departments had produced and directly helped communes produce more than 20 million tons of various fertilizers and more than 14,000 tons of indigenous pesticides, as well as a large number of agricultural tools and pesticide machinery.

　　In early April, 40% of the province's mid-season rice has been sown, 10 million mu of sweet potatoes have been planted, 30% of the 10 million mu of corn has been sown, and cotton sowing has also been accelerated, completing more than 40% of the planned sowing area. Sugarcane, peanuts, and many minor crops are also being sown intensively.

    春耕播种　机不可失
    江苏省委号召以春耕春种为当前工作中心
    四川集中人力物力财力加强农业生产战线
    本报南京9日电　中共江苏省委于4月5日举行了开展春耕春播大生产运动的广播动员大会，号召各地以春耕春种为当前农村压倒一切的中心。
    清明一过，江苏各地的春耕春播十分紧张，全省二千八百多万亩春田，有六百多万亩玉米和高粱正在播种，还有二千二百多万亩早稻、早大豆、春山芋、稻子、棉花、春花生、麻类、烟草、甜菜，都要在清明到立夏这一段时间里种好栽好。这一个多月是决定全年农业生产大丰收的一个关键时期。不违农时，搞好春播，抓好秋熟大丰收的头，是争取今年农业生产更大跃进的一个大仗。
    省委书记刘顺元在广播大会上分析了今年的春耕春种具有比过去更加有利的条件后，要求各地当前必须着重解决以下四个问题：
    第一，要合理调整作物布局。人民公社农作物的布局，必须保证国家计划的完成。在这个前提下，各地因地制宜，实行合理种植。凡是原来计划规定过细过死的地方，或者队与队之间品种布局不合理的地方，应该允许公社和生产大队作某些适当的调整。人民公社在安排种植计划的时候，要注意发展高产作物，扩大水稻、花生面积，小杂粮和小经济作物也要作具体安排，以满足工业生产和社员生活的需要。作物布局，一定要经过社员的充分讨论，倾听大多数人的意见，然后定到队、定到组、定到田。今年的产量指标、征购任务、收益分配和“三包一奖”方案，都要交给社员讨论，迅速确定下来，使社员了解收多少，分多少，吃多少。
    第二，要全面实行农业八字宪法。在农作物播种的时候，合理密植是一个中心环节。各地委和县委要严肃认真地检查各个公社和生产大队的密植计划，要坚持合理密植，防止过分密植。关于密植的规格，一定要反复和群众商量。
    第三，在春耕春种的同时，必须抓好夏熟作物的后期管理和蔬菜、家畜、家禽的生产。从现在的情况看，夏熟作物生长很好，丰收大有希望。但是，决不能麻痹松懈，因为夏熟作物多灾多难的季节还刚刚开始。倒伏、春霜、旱涝、病虫，将会严重威胁夏熟作物的丰收。对于过密的小麦，要以防止倒伏为中心，赶快采取措施，打破“惜苗”思想，该抽行的抽行，该开沟的开沟，该疏苗的疏苗，使其通风透光。
    第四，要全面合理地安排和使用劳动力。首先要满足农业生产的需要，特别是在春耕春种这个大忙的季节里，农村绝大多数的劳动力，都应当用于农业生产。这个期间农业生产上所使用的劳动力，至少要占到农村劳动力总数的80％以至85％以上。其他各项工作，所用的劳动力，必须减少到最低限度。各级党委应该按照保证重点、照顾一般的原则，对劳动力进行全面安排。同时，必须抓好工具改革，提高劳动效率。把各种生产责任制建立和健全起来，普遍实行评工记分，实行多劳多得。
    省委要求各地，凡是与春耕春种有矛盾的工作，可缓则缓，当停则停。各级领导机关，除留必要的人员坚持日常工作之外，大多数干部应当深入下去，和社员同吃同住同劳动，在参加生产中指导生产。党委的主要负责干部，更要深入下去，重点检查，发现问题，解决问题，决不可以只听汇报，只看报表。
    在广播大会上，许多县委书记和公社党委书记表示坚决响应省委的号召，保证不误农时，按质按量完成春耕春种任务。
    本报成都9日电　四川各地集中主要人力、物力和财力加强农业生产第一线，以便把春耕春播推向新高潮。
    四川各地在3月底即作好了大战4月，向农业全面进军的部署。省、地、县、区抽调了八万名干部下乡，参加生产领导生产。各地、县委除留一位书记和少数委员管工业和财经工作外，其他领导同志都投入农业生产。
    为保证春耕春播有足够的劳力，各地对劳力重新加以安排，并从多方面挖掘潜力。温江专区各县精打细算，逐级安排，层层检查，增加了四十万个劳动力投入当前农业生产。万县专区也给农业战线增加十二万个强劳动力。其他各专区也都抽出生活福利、社办工业等方面过多的劳力投入农业生产，动员城镇居民支援生产，尽量减少公社非生产人员。目前，各专区用于农业生产的主要劳动力都在70％以上。在次要的生产战线上，普遍实行了以弱代强，以女代男，抽出强劳力从事农业生产。
    财力、物力也优先满足农业生产需要。到3月中旬止，全省已发放农贷九千多万元（比去年同期增加了一倍多），去年收回的贫农合作基金贷款将全部转作国家对公社的投资，八千多万元小麦、油菜等作物的预备定金提前拨到各个公社。各地公社利用这些贷款和预备金，购置了大批农具、农药、肥料、种子。比往年多得多的生产资料正日夜源源向农业生产前线赶运。商业部门组织的供应组，在生产前线非常活跃，他们除了积极组织供应各种生产资料和生活日用品外，还深入公社、生产队，协助制定规划、解决原料和技术问题，并且就地制造生产资料。仅绵阳专区八个县商业部门就有一千五百多个职工经常在各个公社活动。全省商业部门到3月份止，自己生产和直接帮助公社生产的各种肥料二千多万吨，土农药一万四千多吨，另外，还有大批农具，农药械等。
    4月初，全省中稻已播种40％，一千万亩红薯已经播完，一千万亩玉米已播种30％，棉花播种工作也较前加快，已完成计划播种数的40％以上。甘蔗、花生以及许多小宗作物也都正在加紧播种。
