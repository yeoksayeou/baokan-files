Title: One Person Does the Work of Ten

One does the work of ten, ten does the work of a hundred—this is the hallmark of our heroic era. At the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory, milling worker Wang Houzhen, having completed seven years' worth of production tasks in the past year, has already completed two years and seven months of work in the first two months and twenty-three days of this year, accomplishing the work of ten people single-handedly. Recently, he also expressed his determination to complete ten years' worth of tasks in one year.

This year, the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory's planned targets have increased by 1.3 times based on last year's Great Leap Forward. According to this plan's requirements, Wang Houzhen would need to have 1,200 minutes of work time each day to realize the Great Leap Forward plan. However, Wang Houzhen's actual work time is only 480 minutes per day. With insufficient work time and heavy tasks, could he still achieve a Great Leap Forward? He answered with facts: Yes! From the beginning of this year to March 23rd, he had already completed more than thirty-one months' worth of tasks, increasing labor productivity by more than nine times.

Why was Wang Houzhen able to do the work of ten people with insufficient work time? First and foremost, because of his high political consciousness. He said, "The Great Leap Forward in production is the glorious task of the working class." Therefore, when he encounters difficulties in production, he does not retreat or become passive, but instead faces the difficulties head-on and finds ways to overcome them. When the factory started trial-manufacturing a 1,000-horsepower steam turbine this year, he was tasked with milling the steam turbine blades. Using the original jigs and fixtures resulted in very low production efficiency. He thought, "If one person can't complete the plan, the entire factory's Great Leap Forward plan will fail." So he used his spare time to make a fixture for milling the blades. Previously, milling one blade, clamped with pliers, required two milling operations; now, with the fixture clamping the blades, forty blades can be milled in one operation.

Wang Houzhen is able to do the work of ten people not only because he has soaring enthusiasm but also because he is good at using his brain and finding solutions. He advocates "technical innovation in everything, finding the knack in every product." Wang Houzhen has already implemented eight major technical innovations this year, with the highest increasing labor efficiency by forty times and the lowest by more than three times. For the 2105 diesel engine part lifting grab, manual processing by fitters was used in the past. This processing method was very troublesome, requiring sawing and filing, and it took thirty minutes to mill one part. Wang Houzhen made a tool that can be used on a milling machine to mill it in one go, taking only three minutes, improving efficiency tenfold.

    一当十
    一当十，十当百，这是我们英雄时代的特色。南昌柴油机厂铣工汪厚珍在去年一年完成七年生产任务的基础上，今年两个月又二十三天中，已完成了两年零七个月的工作量，一个人干完了十个人的活。最近，他又表示：一年要完成十年任务。
    今年，南昌柴油机厂计划指标在去年大跃进的基础上，又增加了一点三倍。按这个计划要求，汪厚珍每天要有一千二百分钟工时，才能实现跃进计划。可是汪厚珍的实有工时每天只有四百八十分钟。工时不足，任务重，能不能跃进呢？他用事实作了回答：能！从今年开始，到3月23日止，他已经完成了三十一个多月的任务，提高劳动生产效率九倍以上。
    汪厚珍为什么能在工时不足的情况下，一个人干了十个人的活呢？首先由于他的政治觉悟高。他说：“生产大跃进，是工人阶级的光荣任务。”因此，他在生产中遇到困难时，不是退却、消极，而是迎上困难，想办法克服困难。今年厂里开始试制一千马力汽轮机时，他担任铣汽轮机叶片的任务，用原来的工夹具铣，生产效率很低。他想：“一个人完不成计划，全厂跃进计划就会落空。”他就利用业余时间制成一个铣叶片的夹具。以前用老虎钳夹起来铣，一只要铣两次，现在把叶片用夹具夹起来，一次就铣四十只。
    汪厚珍能一个人干完十个人的活，还由于他不仅有冲天干劲，而且还善于动脑筋，想办法。他主张“事事技术革新，件件产品找窍门。”汪厚珍今年已经实现了八项重大技术革新，最高的提高劳动效率四十倍，最低的也提高三倍以上。生产2105型柴油机零件起重抓，过去是用钳工手工加工，这种加工方法非常麻烦，要用锯子锯，锉子锉，铣一只要三十分钟。汪厚珍制成了一个工具，在铣床上铣，一次铣成，只用三分钟，提高效率十倍。　　　　　　　　（章贡）
