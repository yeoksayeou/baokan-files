    Friends and Leader
    ——Commemorating the Eighty-Ninth Anniversary of Lenin's Birth
    Lin Ling
    People have become accustomed to using these concise words to call the great Lenin: the leader and friend of all the world's workers. Friend – what an intimate word!

    Lenin became a leader of the workers primarily because he lived among the workers and became their close friend. Throughout his life, Lenin paid the utmost attention to connecting with the masses. He learned about situations from them, learned from them, and offered them his own opinions. Lenin was able to listen to others' opinions humbly and patiently, and he could also offer suggestions to others frankly and kindly. This made it easy for him to become a friend of the masses. His warmth and approachability, combined with his calm and decisive judgment, made those who came into contact with him immediately regard him as their best friend and reluctant to leave him. Krupskaya said: "He did not treat the workers with the attitude of an arrogant teacher, but first and foremost as a friend and comrade of the workers." One of Lenin's early comrades, Kalininsky, recalled: "This was truly a leader of the Party, and at the same time, an ordinary comrade who could be approached and to whom one could confide everything in one's heart."

    Lenin sought every possible opportunity to talk with the workers and peasants. Whenever there was a meeting, he would always seek out the masses attending the meeting to converse with them. The information the masses reflected to him, after his thorough analysis, became an important basis for his conclusions and decisions in political theory and revolutionary strategy.

    Before the October Revolution, Lenin spent most of his time living abroad, but he understood the domestic situation even more comprehensively than anyone who had just arrived from Russia. This was because every time he met someone from the country, he would treat them like a treasure and "interrogate" them, maintaining close correspondence with many Party members and masses in the country.

    Correspondence was an extremely important aspect of Lenin's working methods. He was accustomed to writing letters himself, and even after the October Revolution, when managing the affairs of the entire Party and the entire country, he was very busy, but he rarely used dictation to write letters or instructions. At the end of 1922, his right hand was paralyzed and he could not write, so he learned to write with his left hand. He left behind a large number of letters, more than one million words of which have been published in the Collected Works of Lenin alone.

    Even in prison and exile, Lenin never stopped corresponding with his comrades. Through letters, Lenin understood the situation, observed the situation, used it as a basis for considering issues, solved theoretical problems, and directed the revolutionary struggle. His old comrade, Krzhizhanovsky, recalled: "We received about two letters from him every week, so we knew about his own work and the news he got from extensive correspondence. ... He could always give concise and thoughtful answers to the essence of the issues involved. ... Upon receiving a letter, he could reply with fierce debate, but he could also ignore issues he thought should not be raised at all."

    Learning from the working methods of the great proletarian leader Lenin, closely connecting with the masses, becoming one with the masses, talking to the masses more, and communicating with the masses more, is something we should always remember.

    朋友和领袖
    ——纪念列宁诞辰八十九周年
    林陵
    人们已经习惯用这样概括的字眼称呼伟大的列宁：全世界劳动者的领袖和朋友。朋友——这是多么亲切的字眼！
    列宁之成为劳动者的领袖，首先是他生活在劳动者中间，做了劳动者的亲密的朋友。列宁一生最注意和群众联系，他从群众那里了解情况，他向群众学习，他给群众提出自己的意见。列宁能谦虚和耐心地倾听别人的意见，也能坦率和亲切地向别人提意见。这就使他容易成为群众的朋友。他的热情可亲和冷静善断，使接触他的人立刻把他当作最好的朋友而不愿意离开他。克鲁普斯卡娅说：“他不是用傲慢的教师的态度对待工人，而首先是做工人的朋友和同志”。列宁早期的一位战友卡尔宾斯基回忆说：“这才真正是党的领袖，同时又是这样一个可以接近他并向他倾诉心中一切的普通同志。”
    列宁寻找一切可能的机会和工农群众谈话。开什么会，他总是要找来参加会的群众交谈。群众向他反映的情况，经过他周密的分析，成为他在政治理论和革命战略方面作出结论和决定的重要依据。
    在十月革命之前，列宁大部分时间侨居国外，但是他甚至比刚从俄国来的任何人都更全面地了解国内的情况。因为他每遇到一个国内来的人，就如获至宝似地“追问盘查”，同国内许多党员和群众维持密切的通信关系。
    通信是列宁工作方法中极重要的一项。他习惯于亲自动笔写信，即使在十月革命后，管理全党全国的事务，十分紧张，也很少用口授的方式写信写指令。1922年底，他的右手麻痹不能写字，他曾学习用左手书写。他身后留下了大量的书信，单是公布在列宁全集里的，就有一百多万字。
    列宁甚至在监狱和流放地，也从不间断和同志们通信。通过信函，列宁了解情况，观察形势，作为考虑问题的根据，解决理论问题，指示革命斗争。他的老战友克尔日札诺夫斯基回忆说：“我们大约每周接到他两封信，因此知道他自己的工作情况以及他由于通信面广而得来的消息。……他对涉及的问题的本质，总能给以简练的、经过深思熟虑的答复。……接到一封信，他可以回信作激烈的论战，但是也可以对他认为完全不应该提的问题置之不理。”
    学习无产阶级伟大领袖列宁的工作方法，密切联系群众，同群众打成一片，多找群众谈话，多和群众通声气，这是我们永远应该记住的。
