    Prior to the convening of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on repeated suggestions by Comrade Mao Zedong, adopted a decision agreeing to Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal that he not be a candidate for Chairman of the People's Republic of China in the next term. The decision also pointed out: "Comrade Mao Zedong is a long-tested leader sincerely loved by the people of all nationalities throughout the country. After he no longer holds the post of Chairman of the State, he will still be the leader of the people of all nationalities throughout the country." After this, in early April of this year, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC discussed and decided on the nomination of candidates for leaders of state institutions. After the plenary session, the Central Committee of the CPC, in accordance with the decision of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, conducted full consultations with the leaders of various democratic parties and major people's organizations. On April 15, Chairman Mao Zedong convened the Sixteenth Supreme State Conference to discuss the list of candidates and unanimously agreed to submit it to the Presidium of this Congress and the joint meeting of the heads of each delegation. During this Congress, each delegation had a full discussion on this issue. The list of candidates for leaders of state institutions proposed at today's Congress was determined by the Presidium of the Congress and the joint meeting of the heads and deputy heads of each delegation based on the discussion results of each delegation.
    During the vote counting process, the meeting continued with the general discussion.

    在进行各项选举的时候，执行主席首先根据会议主席团成员和各代表组组长、副组长的联合提名，宣布候选人名单，征询代表们有无别的提名，并且说明如不同意提名名单上的人，可以另外选举自己所愿意选举的人，也可以选举自己。代表们每一次都以热烈的掌声欢迎各项提名。

    在计算选票的过程中，会议继续进行了大会讨论。
    政协第三届全国委员会全体委员、政府各部门的负责人、中国人民解放军的高级将领，列席了今天的会议。各国驻华使节和一部分在北京访问的外宾，也应邀列席了会议。
