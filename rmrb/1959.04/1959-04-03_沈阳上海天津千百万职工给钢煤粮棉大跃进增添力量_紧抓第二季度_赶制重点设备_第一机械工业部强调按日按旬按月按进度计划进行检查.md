Shenyang, Shanghai, and Tianjin Millions of Workers Add Strength to the Great Leap Forward in Steel, Coal, Grain, and Cotton
Seize the Second Quarter and Rush to Produce Key Equipment
The First Ministry of Machine Building Emphasizes Inspection According to Daily, Ten-Day, and Monthly Progress Plans

This newspaper reports that a large number of factories in Shenyang are concentrating their efforts on rushing to produce coal washing equipment and irrigation and drainage equipment, striving to complete production tasks on schedule, in quantity, with quality, and as complete sets.

Shenyang is responsible for manufacturing 1,290 pieces of coal washing equipment, including coal washing machines, coal feeders, tippler machines, belt conveyors, and water pumps. Workers from eight machinery factories, including Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory and Shenyang General Machinery Factory, which are responsible for the main manufacturing tasks, have launched an unprecedented technical revolution under the slogan "Fight for Coal Washing Machines." Everyone is working to overcome difficulties, creating favorable conditions for completing the coal washing equipment ahead of schedule. Shenyang Water Pump Factory, which is responsible for producing 254 coal washing water pumps, also has to produce a large number of water pumps for irrigation and drainage, power stations, and steel rolling. However, according to the spirit of prioritizing the most important and urgent tasks, the factory, while arranging various production tasks, mobilized workers to rush to manufacture coal washing water pumps. It also promptly guided the technical revolution movement towards a movement of a thousand high-yield experts and a hundred red flag bearers, fully leveraging everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm to ensure that every single coal washing water pump is produced. The state required that the eighty 18-ton coal washing machines produced by Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory be delivered in early May, with a short construction period and complex technology. According to the state's urgent needs, the factory put the manufacturing of coal washing machines in the first place and, in the high tide of everyone contributing clever plans and everyone rushing for high output, completed the manufacturing of all coal washing machines 43 days ahead of schedule on March 28.

Shenyang needs to complete the production of 190,000 horsepower of complete irrigation and drainage equipment by the end of April. Since the beginning of this year, more than 100 factories undertaking the manufacturing of this batch of equipment, under the unified command of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee's Irrigation and Drainage Equipment Leading Group, have arranged monthly, ten-day, and daily work plans, closely monitoring the progress of the production of various components of the product, and inspecting on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. Problems are promptly solved, ensuring that batches of complete irrigation and drainage equipment with tens of thousands of horsepower are manufactured to support spring plowing. Shenyang Water Pump Factory, which completed the first quarter's production tasks seven days ahead of schedule, originally planned to produce 5,700 sets of farmland water pumps with 143,000 horsepower by the end of April. However, due to closely grasping all production links and carrying out technical revolutions, the production progress has been continuously accelerated. Workshop Three alone can now produce 100 such water pumps every day. Shenyang Qiming Machinery Factory overcame the difficulties of insufficient processing equipment and improved many tools through self-reliance, improving work efficiency and accelerating the manufacturing progress.

This newspaper reports that Shanghai's machinery industry is expanding the scope of production coordination to ensure the completion of the manufacturing tasks of coal washing and coking equipment ahead of schedule or on time, in quantity, and with quality. This batch of equipment includes more than 3,000 products such as various crushers, coal washing water pumps, coal loading cars, coke pushing cars, and belt conveyors, which are supplied to support the construction of simple coal washing plants and simple coke ovens across the country, and will be completed before June.

Zhonghua Industrial Factory needs to produce 2,400 square meters of copper bar screens for coal washing plants before the end of April. This quantity is close to the factory's total annual output last year, and it would take eight months to manufacture according to the factory's production capacity. The Shanghai Machinery Bureau organized more than a dozen factories to support them in equipment and technical innovation. The factory directors and branch secretaries of these factories immediately led experienced master craftsmen to assist Zhonghua Industrial Factory in solving production difficulties. Jicheng Machine Factory and other factories also "stopped production to make way," using their own factory's steel to rush to manufacture eight sets of punching dies, which were promptly used to support the production of Zhonghua Industrial Factory.

In order to catch up with time and speed up, the Shanghai Machinery Bureau also adjusted the products of some factories. Qunxing Machinery Manufacturing Factory originally produced papermaking machinery and is now responsible for manufacturing 360 crushers for crushing coal. Shanghai No. 1 Water Pump Factory transferred the blowers it was producing to other factories and is now concentrating all its efforts on rushing to produce industrial pumps for coal mining and coal washing. In this way, it is estimated that all coal washing pumps can be completed one month ahead of schedule.

This newspaper reports that 48 factories in Tianjin are carrying out the "two dragons" inter-factory competition, which has greatly accelerated the progress of manufacturing irrigation and drainage equipment. In March, the irrigation and drainage equipment produced by these factories was more than the sum of January and February. By March 25, more than 5,500 sets of gas engines and diesel engines with a total of more than 34,900 horsepower had been rushed out.

According to the state plan, the irrigation and drainage equipment produced by the 48 factories in Tianjin from January to April will increase by half compared with the total output of the whole year last year, with a total of 10,100 sets, totaling more than 63,000 horsepower. These irrigation and drainage equipment are assembled by Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Factory and Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory, and the remaining factories process various parts for the two factories. In order to adapt to the characteristics of this multi-factory collaborative production and ensure the completion of tasks on time, in quantity, with quality, and as complete sets, workers in various factories, with the assistance of relevant leading departments, launched the "two dragons" production competition in mid-February. That is, the general assembly factory and its cooperative factories each form a "dragon", first launching a competition with the "dragon" as a unit, and at the same time carrying out the same type of competition and large-scale production collaboration between the various production links of the "two dragons". In the more than 40 days since the launch of this inter-factory competition, a lively labor competition has formed between groups and individuals within various factories. The workers of the two "dragon head" factories alone have put forward more than 10,000 technical innovation suggestions, and the timely implementation of a large number of innovation suggestions has solved many problems existing in production and greatly accelerated the manufacturing progress of irrigation and drainage equipment.

This newspaper reports that in order to ensure the realization of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton this year, the First Ministry of Machine Building recently arranged the production and capital construction work for the second quarter according to the principle of concentrating strength, shortening the front, and focusing on key points. In terms of production, it is required to fully guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the planned targets for six key products and their supporting products, such as steel rolling, mining, coal washing and coking, power stations, agricultural irrigation and harvesting machinery, and locomotives and vehicles. The focus of capital construction is on projects that are necessary to complete this year's key product production tasks, or that can be put into immediate use after equipment is installed, or that have only a small amount of finishing work to be done.

When deploying work to its subordinate enterprises, the First Ministry of Machine Building especially emphasized that fully leveraging internal potential is the primary condition for completing the plan; requiring all enterprises to carry out mass movements centered on technical revolution, take concrete and solid measures, continuously improve technical level, quickly master the technology of producing new key products, greatly improve labor productivity, shorten production cycles, improve product quality, reduce product costs, and further improve enterprise production management and labor organization. At the same time, in the supply of raw materials, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of centralized use and guaranteed key points.

In order to realize the planned targets for this period, in addition to requiring enterprises undertaking the production tasks of key products to actively organize production, the First Ministry of Machine Building also adjusted a part of the production capacity from existing enterprises as much as possible and invested it in the production of key products.

The First Ministry of Machine Building requires all employees of relevant departments and enterprises to muster greater enthusiasm in the second quarter, which is decisive for completing the annual task, seize the opportunity, actively arrange the quarterly progress, monthly progress, ten-day progress, and daily progress of key products and key projects, carry it through to the end, firmly grasp it, inspect according to the schedule, and strive for high output and high quality every day, every ten days, and every month.
