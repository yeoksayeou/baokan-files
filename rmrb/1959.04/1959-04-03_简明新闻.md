    Gansu Strengthens Sheep Dipping Work
    Gansu has greatly reduced external parasite diseases in sheep through active prevention and treatment work over the past few years. Since 1953, the state has built eight large-scale dipping pools in pastoral areas with concentrated sheep populations, and 1.5 million sheep have undergone dipping. After the people's communes were established last year, people's communes in areas such as the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County and the Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, built 37 medium-sized earthen dipping pools, and more than 200 mobile dipping pools and troughs, actively carrying out sheep dipping and disease prevention work.
    
    Bouyei People Develop Fruit Tree Production
    Luodian County, a Bouyei ethnic minority area in Qiannan Prefecture, Guizhou Province, launched a mass movement of planting fruit trees for everyone during afforestation. According to recent statistics, the county has transplanted more than 580,000 saplings of Guanggan oranges alone, covering an area of more than 8,000 mu. In addition, seedlings of bananas, plantains, pomelos, pears, peaches, apricots, and other fruits have been planted in various places.
    The quantity and quality of these fruit trees have been greatly improved compared to the past.

    Guangxi Strengthens Corn Field Management
    In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, early corn, which was sown in 5.73 million mu, has grown more than eight inches tall, and middle corn has emerged by three inches. Currently, farmers of all ethnic groups are strengthening corn field management, striving for a bumper corn harvest this year.
    Counties in the Nanning Prefecture, which plant the most corn, have transferred a certain amount of labor to organize professional teams, taking measures to strengthen corn field management by contracting time, tasks, and quality. Some communes have also organized disaster prevention and mitigation committees, mobilizing commune members to fight against diseases and insect pests.
