Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th. Our correspondent reports: Riding on the Chollima, the people of North Korea are undertaking basic construction of unprecedented and grand scale this year, with factories, power stations, and residential buildings being built everywhere.

    This year, North Korea's national investment in basic construction totals over 1 billion North Korean won, accounting for 43% of the total national budget expenditure, of which about half is used for industrial construction.

    According to the call of the Korean Workers' Party that "steel and machinery are the kings of industry," this year the basic construction investment in the metallurgical and machinery industries accounts for 77.7% of the total industrial basic construction investment. The various steel and machinery factories that have been restored and newly built after the war will be expanded on a large scale this year.

    In order to produce more than twice as much steel as last year, the metallurgical sector will restore and construct twice as many smelting and rolling equipment this year as last year.

    In the machinery industry sector, the Kiyang Machinery Factory, Deokcheon Automobile Factory, Bukjung Machinery Factory, and others are undergoing reconstruction and expansion in order to mass-produce tractors, trucks, and bulldozers. The Bukjung Machinery Factory will build a huge factory building with a construction area of 30,000 square meters this year.

    In the electricity sector, the Unbong, Ganggye, and Turujiang hydropower stations are being built.

    In the chemical sector, factories for artificial fiber and plastics are being built.

    In order to better meet the needs of the people's lives, the light industry sector is also carrying out a number of construction projects this year. The newly built Sinuiju Artificial Fiber Textile Mill will begin production this year on "August 15th." When the factory is finally completed, it will produce 20,000 tons of artificial fiber and 60 million meters of fabric annually.

    The number of residential buildings constructed in North Korea's urban and rural areas will increase significantly this year. In Pyongyang, residential buildings for 20,000 households will be built.

    In order to realize the irrigation of agriculture, North Korea is building four large-scale irrigation projects: Kiyang, Eujitun, Cheongdan, and Yalu River.

    One of the characteristics of North Korea's basic construction this year is self-reliance. All kinds of production equipment, from complete sets of blast furnaces and coke ovens to equipment for food processing plants and irrigation projects, are manufactured by North Korea itself.

    Another characteristic is fast speed and high quality. The newly built Sinuiju Artificial Fiber Textile Mill only started construction in August last year. Due to the use of prefabricated construction methods, the factory buildings for spinning and weaving have already been erected, and machines will be installed soon. The spinning mill will start production in May. The newly built converter steelmaking workshops in various steel plants also started construction last winter or spring, but they will all be put into production in the first half of this year. In terms of quality, the new factories built this year all have mechanized and automated production equipment.

### 速度快　质量高　设备自己造  朝鲜建设规模空前宏伟

    朝鲜建设规模空前宏伟
    新华社平壤6日电　本社记者报道：骑上千里马的朝鲜人民今年进行着史无前例的、规模宏伟的基本建设，到处在建筑工厂、电站和住宅大楼。
    今年朝鲜国家对基本建设的投资总额达朝币十亿多元，占国家预算总支出的43％，其中用于工业建设的约占一半。
    根据朝鲜劳动党提出的“钢铁和机械是工业之王”的号召，今年冶金和机械工业的基本建设投资占整个工业基本建设投资的77.7％。战后恢复和新建的各个钢铁和机械厂，今年都要大规模地扩建。
    冶金部门今年为了生产比去年多一倍多的钢铁，今年恢复建设的冶炼和压延设备将比去年增加一倍。
    在机械工业部门，岐阳机械工厂、德川汽车厂、北中机械厂等为了成批生产拖拉机、载重汽车和推土机，都在进行改建和扩建。北中机械厂今年要新建一座三万平方公尺建筑面积的巨大的厂房。
    电力部门正在兴建云峰、江界、秃鲁江三个水力发电站。
    化学部门在兴建人造纤维和塑料工厂。
    为了更好地满足人民的生活需要，轻工业部门今年也进行着多项的建设。新建的新义州人造纤维联合纺织厂将在今年“八·一五”开始投入生产，这座工厂最后建成时将年产二万吨人造纤维、六千万公尺布匹。
    今年朝鲜城乡建设的住宅将大量增加。在平壤要建设供二万户居住的住宅。
    为了实现农业的水利化，朝鲜正在建设着岐阳、于之屯、青丹、鸭绿江四个大规模的灌溉工程。
    今年朝鲜基本建设的特点之一是：自力更生，各种生产设备从整套高炉和炼焦炉的设备到食品加工厂、灌溉工程的设备都由朝鲜自己制造。
    另一个特点是速度快、质量高。新建的新义州人造纤维联合纺织厂。去年8月间才开始动工，由于采用了装配式的建筑方法，现在纺纱和织布厂的厂房已经矗立起来，很快就要安装机器，5月间纺纱厂就要开始生产。各钢铁厂新建的转炉炼钢车间也都是在去年冬天或今年春天开始动工的，但今年上半年都要投入生产。在质量方面，今年新建的工厂都具有机械的和自动的生产设备。
