Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: People from all circles in the capital, including workers, government cadres, and students, numbering over 800, gathered at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall tonight to commemorate the 89th anniversary of the birth of the great revolutionary teacher Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Soviet Embassy in China Counselor V. Likhachev and other diplomatic personnel attended the commemoration.

The commemoration was jointly organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and was presided over by Yang Shu, Vice President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Jiang Chunfang, Deputy Director of the Bureau for the Compilation and Translation of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin's Works of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report on "Commemorating Lenin, Learning from Lenin" at the meeting. In his report, he said that throughout his revolutionary life, Lenin extensively connected with the masses, cared about the masses, learned about situations through the masses, and learned from the masses, correctly guiding the masses to advance the revolutionary cause. He diligently studied and researched, armed himself with rich knowledge, and educated and led the working people to overcome the enemy and achieve revolutionary victory. One of Lenin's most prominent characteristics was his continuous development of Marxist theory, and he used dialectics as a method and guide for research and propaganda, decision-making and activities throughout his life. He was also good at mastering a large amount of material, analyzing the situation, and making scientific predictions about future developments. Today, when we commemorate Lenin, we must learn from Lenin's spirit of pursuing truth, studying diligently, being strict with himself, being modest and sincere to others, and fighting for the revolutionary cause of the working class throughout his life; we must also learn from his method and style of work of connecting with the masses, strictly implementing plans, and being serious and down-to-earth in everything.

After the commemoration, the Soviet film "Lenin's Story" was screened.

    新华社22日讯　首都工人、机关干部、学生等各界人士八百余人，今晚在中苏友好馆集会纪念伟大的革命导师弗·伊·列宁八十九周年诞辰。苏联驻华大使馆参赞魏立夏金等外交人员出席了纪念会。
    纪念会是中苏友好协会总会和北京市中苏友好协会联合举办的，由北京市中苏友好协会副会长杨述主持。中共中央马恩列斯著作编译局副局长姜椿芳在会上作了“纪念列宁、学习列宁”的报告。他在报告中说，列宁在他革命的一生中，广泛联系群众、关心群众，通过群众了解情况，并向群众学习，正确指导群众推进革命事业；他刻苦学习、钻研，用丰富的知识武装自己，教育和领导劳动人民战胜敌人，取得革命的胜利。列宁最突出的特点之一是不断发展马克思主义理论，并终生以辩证法作为进行研究和宣传、决策和活动的方法和指南。他还善于掌握大量材料，分析形势，对未来的发展作出科学的预见。今天我们纪念列宁，是要学习列宁追求真理、刻苦学习、待己严格、对人谦虚诚恳、并为工人阶级革命事业奋斗终生的精神；还要学习他联系群众、严格执行计划和对事认真踏实的工作方法和作风。
