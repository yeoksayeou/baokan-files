Xinhua News Agency, Xigaze, April 1st. The full text of Panchen Erdeni's speech at the rally of all circles in Xigaze City on March 30th in support of the State Council's order is as follows:

	Dear Tibetan monks, lay people, and patriotic individuals:

	The rebels of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group have now openly embarked on the criminal road of betraying the motherland and the people. On March 28th, the State Council, based on the various rebellious crimes of the rebels of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, issued an order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and quell the rebellion. The Xinhua News Agency's communique on the Tibetan rebellion incident detailed the facts and specific process of the Tibetan reactionary group's betrayal of the country and the people. You must all recognize right from wrong, support the order of the Central People's Government, support the proclamation of the Tibet Military Region, and actively assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion.

	The rebels of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group are truly guilty of numerous crimes and are full of evil. They have consistently obstructed and undermined the efforts made by the Central People's Government, the Tibetan people, and patriotic individuals to thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. They have consistently engaged in conspiracies to split the motherland and undermine national unity. They have consistently refused to reorganize the Tibetan army and consistently opposed your gradual progress towards a prosperous and happy socialist society through democratic reforms. Their actions are entirely harmful to your interests and contrary to your wishes. The Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have consistently been lenient towards these reactionary behaviors, explaining the greater good and patiently waiting, giving them a chance to repent. However, the rebels of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group have remained stubborn. They colluded with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, absurdly believing that the powerful central government of the motherland was "weak" and the invincible People's Liberation Army was "deceivable." Last year, they supported and expanded the armed rebellion, harming monks and lay people everywhere. Now, they are fabricating rumors and, under arrogant pretexts, wickedly kidnapped the Dalai Lama. They murdered patriotic and progressive individuals, persecuted Tibetan cadres and people, gathered bandits, and forced and deceived some of the masses, provoking a full-scale armed rebellion in Lhasa. Monks, lay people, and patriotic individuals, you should recognize that the rebels of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group are traitors to the motherland, are scum of the Tibetan people, and are the common enemies of all ethnic groups in our country. They are like demons.

	The Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government are deeply concerned about the interests of the Tibetan people. The People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet are thinking of everyone everywhere. Although the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group have tried every means to obstruct and undermine, the People's Liberation Army and staff have still done many good things that benefit the masses, such as building roads, establishing hospitals, schools, and other construction projects, issuing various loans, and providing relief to disaster-stricken people. All of these are widely opening the doors to good deeds. However, the rebels, in order to deceive the masses, have turned black and white upside down, claiming that they are protecting "national interests." Could it be said that betraying the motherland, turning Tibet back into a colony of imperialism, and making everyone suffer deep disasters again, is in line with the interests of the broad masses of monks and lay people? Could it be said that opposing the construction of a prosperous and happy new Tibet, opposing everyone building a beautiful and happy life, is in line with the interests of the broad masses of monks and lay people? No, this is fundamentally opposing and harming the interests of the broad masses of monks and lay people. Their so-called "national interests" are actually the private interests of imperialism and a handful of reactionaries. Everyone can more easily see their true colors from the rebels' crimes of looting the masses.

	The People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet have faithfully implemented the religious freedom policy of the Communist Party and the Central People's Government. Patriotic and law-abiding temples and monks and lay people have been protected. The rebels, in order to deceive the masses, have obliterated the facts, fabricated rumors, and claimed that they are "protecting religion." But in the name of so-called "protecting religion," they wickedly kidnapped the Dalai Lama, murdered and insulted monks and nuns, desecrated Buddha statues, and robbed objects offered to Buddha. Obviously, this is by no means a good deed to protect religion, but an evil deed that violates the teachings of our Buddhism. Monks should practice purity and cultivate themselves, love the country and abide by the law. The people in some temples who betray the motherland and commit heinous crimes are not true religious believers at all, but are counter-revolutionaries and bad elements who have infiltrated the temples. Punishing these bandits in accordance with national law is to eliminate harm for the people and eliminate evil for the religious community, and does not violate the policy of religious freedom in the slightest. Using religion as a pretext to engage in rebellion is not tolerated by national law or allowed by the monks. Those who have been coerced and deceived for a time should immediately lay down their butcher knives and sincerely repent. As long as they do so, they will surely be treated leniently by the People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan people.

	Now, the rebel armed forces of the Tibetan reactionary group have been severely punished by the People's Liberation Army. This is the evil result they have obtained by seeking their own destruction. They deserve it.

	I express my deep sympathy and concern for the situation of the Dalai Lama being kidnapped by the rebels. I hope that he will get rid of the control of the rebels as soon as possible. During the period he is held hostage, I fully accept the State Council's order for me to serve as the Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. I will make every effort, together with everyone, to actively assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion.

	The People's Liberation Army's quelling of the rebellion is to consolidate the unification of the motherland, to eliminate harm for the Tibetan people, and to clear the obstacles for the road to building a new Tibet. This is a just action that is in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and protects the interests of the Tibetan people. Monks, lay people, and patriotic individuals, I call on you to recognize the major issues of right and wrong, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves with the Tibetan traitorous group, and, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, and with the strong support of the 650 million people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, unite with the People's Liberation Army, heighten our vigilance, and resolutely assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion, and thoroughly smash all the traitorous schemes of the Tibetan reactionary group under the support of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Their wishful thinking of relying on imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out armed rebellion is like a moth flying into a flame, which will surely lead to self-immolation. Because the eight million reactionary troops of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, supported and armed by imperialism, have long been defeated by the People's Liberation Army. Now, the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind, and the strength of the socialist camp has prevailed over the strength of the imperialist camp. The life of imperialism will not be long, let alone a handful of reactionaries who rely on imperialism? Their fate of complete failure is doomed. Victory must belong to the People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan people.

	Long Live the great mother land!
	Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!
	Long Live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in our country!

    班禅额尔德尼在日喀则各界集会上讲话
    号召全藏人民协助政府彻底平乱
    指出西藏叛乱集团罪恶累累危害西藏全体人民利益
    新华社日喀则1日电　班禅额尔德尼3月30日在日喀则市各界拥护国务院命令的集会上讲话的全文如下：亲爱的西藏僧俗人民和爱国人士们：
    西藏地方政府的叛乱分子和上层反动集团现在已经公开走向背叛祖国、背叛人民的罪恶道路。3月28日，国务院根据西藏地方政府的叛乱分子和上层反动集团的种种叛乱罪行发布了解散西藏地方政府和平息叛乱的命令，新华社发表的关于西藏叛乱事件的公报，详细的说明了西藏反动集团叛国叛人民的事实真象和具体过程。人民解放军西藏军区出示的布告宣布了解放军平息叛乱和保护西藏人民利益的各项政策。你们大家一定要认清是非善恶，拥护中央人民政府的命令，拥护西藏军区的布告，积极协助人民解放军平息叛乱。
    西藏地方政府的叛乱分子和上层反动集团真是罪恶累累、恶贯满盈，他们一贯阻挠和破坏中央人民政府、西藏人民和爱国人士为了彻底实现和平解放西藏协议所作的努力，一贯进行分裂祖国，破坏民族团结的阴谋活动，一贯拒绝改编藏军，一贯反对你们经过民主改革逐步走向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。他们的所作所为，完全是危害你们的利益，违背你们的意愿的。中国共产党和中央人民政府对他们的这些反动行为，过去一贯是宽大为怀，晓以大义，耐心等待，给他们以悔改的机会。但是，西藏地方政府的叛乱分子和上层反动集团始终执迷不悟，他们勾结帝国主义和蒋介石集团，荒谬的以为强大祖国的中央“软弱”，无敌的人民解放军“可欺”。去年他们支持和扩大了武装叛乱，到处危害僧俗人民。如今，他们竟捏造谣言，以狂妄的借口，万恶地劫持了达赖喇嘛。他们杀害爱国进步人士，迫害藏族干部和人民，纠集叛匪，强迫欺骗一些群众，在拉萨挑起了全面的武装叛乱。僧俗人民和爱国人士，你们应当认清，西藏地方政府的叛乱分子和上层反动集团是祖国的叛徒，是西藏人民的败类，是我国各族人民的共同敌人，他们犹如魔鬼一样。
    中国共产党、中央人民政府亲切关怀西藏人民的利益。进藏人民解放军和工作人员处处为大家着想。虽然西藏地方政府和上层反动集团百般阻挠和破坏，解放军和工作人员还是办了好多有益群众的好事，如修筑公路、兴办医院、学校及其他建设事业，发放各种贷款，救济受灾群众。无一不是广开善门。但是叛乱分子，为了欺骗群众，竟颠倒黑白，把他们自己说成是保护“民族利益”的人。难道说，背叛祖国，要把西藏重新沦为帝国主义的殖民地，使大家再遭受深重的灾难，是符合广大僧俗人民利益的吗？难道说，反对建设繁荣幸福的新西藏，反对大家建设美好幸福的生活，是符合广大僧俗人民的利益吗？不是的，这正是从根本上反对和损害广大僧俗人民的利益。他们所谓的“民族利益”，实际上是帝国主义和一小撮反动派的私利。大家从叛乱分子抢劫群众的罪行更容易看清他们的真面目。
    进藏人民解放军和工作人员忠实的执行了共产党和中央人民政府的宗教信仰自由政策。爱国守法的寺庙和僧俗都受到了保护。叛乱分子为了欺骗群众，竟抹杀事实，捏造谣言，把他们自己说成是“保护宗教的人”。但是他们在所谓“保护宗教”的名义下，万恶地劫持了达赖喇嘛，杀害和污辱僧尼，沾污佛像和抢劫供奉佛事的物器。显然，这绝不是保护宗教的善行，而是违背我佛教教义的恶行。僧众们应当清戒修持，爱国守法，有的寺庙中背叛祖国、造孽行凶的人根本不是真实的宗教信徒，而是混入寺庙的反革命分子和坏分子。按照国家法律，惩罚这些匪徒，是为人民除害，为宗教界除恶，毫不违背宗教信仰自由的政策。假借宗教名义，进行叛乱活动，是国法所不容，僧众所不许的。一时被胁迫欺骗的人，应当立即放下屠刀，真诚悔悟。只要这样，一定能得到人民解放军和西藏人民的宽大处理。
    现在西藏反动集团的叛乱武装已经遭到人民解放军的有力惩罚。这是他们自寻绝路得到的恶果。他们是罪有应得的。
    我对达赖喇嘛遭受叛乱分子劫持的处境，深表同情和关怀，我希望他早日摆脱叛乱分子的控制。在他被劫持期间，我完全接受国务院命令我担任西藏自治区筹委会代理主任委员的工作。我将竭诚努力，和大家一起，积极协助人民解放军平息叛乱。
    人民解放军平息叛乱，是巩固祖国统一，是为西藏人民除害，是为建设新西藏的前进道路扫除障碍。这是符合西藏人民利益和保护西藏人民利益的正义行动。僧俗群众和爱国人士们，我号召你们，认清大是大非，同西藏叛国集团划清敌我界限，在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导下，在祖国六亿五千万各族人民的有力支援下，和人民解放军团结一致，提高警惕，坚决协助解放军平息叛乱，彻底粉碎西藏反动集团在帝国主义和蒋介石集团的支持下所搞的一切叛国勾当。他们妄想指望帝国主义和蒋介石集团搞武装叛乱，就如灯蛾扑火，一定自焚。因为帝国主义支持和武装的蒋介石集团的八百万反动军队，早已被人民解放军打垮了。现在东风已经压倒了西风，社会主义阵营的力量已经压倒了帝国主义阵营的力量。帝国主义的寿命都不会长久了，何况一小撮指靠帝国主义的反动派呢？他们彻底失败的命运是注定了的。胜利一定是属于人民解放军和西藏人民。
    伟大的祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
