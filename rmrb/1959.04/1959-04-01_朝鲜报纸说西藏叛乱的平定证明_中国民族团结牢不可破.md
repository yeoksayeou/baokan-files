Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 31st. The Pyongyang "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today stating that the fact that the Tibetan reactionary forces, after long-term preparations in active collusion with imperialists, foreign reactionary forces, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, were defeated at one blow, clearly demonstrates to the world that the great national unity of the People's Republic of China is indestructible.

The commentary also stated that this is another huge blow to the imperialists who are frantically attempting to carry out sabotage and disintegration from within the Chinese people.

The "Rodong Sinmun" commentary pointed out that anyone who wants to interfere shamelessly in this event, which is entirely China's internal affair, will inevitably suffer a more shameful defeat.

The commentary also stated: "This clearing of Tibetan rebels has further strengthened the national unity within the Chinese people and opened a new page in the historical development of Tibet."

"Democratic Korea" also pointed out in a commentary on the Tibetan rebellion that imperialists and their lackeys cannot turn back the clock in Tibet.

The commentary said that the order issued by the State Council of the People's Republic of China on the 28th finally shattered the shameless conspiracy of the imperialists and their lackeys—the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet—to force the Tibetan people to return to a medieval slave life.

The newspaper's commentary pointed out that this is the most practical measure to establish peace and a democratic order in Tibet.

The commentary condemned the United States' crude interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. The commentary said that it is intolerable that the U.S. State Department also issued an official statement defaming the Chinese government's legitimate measures against the crimes of the rebel group.

    朝鲜报纸说西藏叛乱的平定证明
    中国民族团结牢不可破
    新华社平壤31日电　平壤“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，西藏反动势力在同帝国主义者、外国反动势力和蒋介石集团的积极勾结下，经过长期准备的叛乱遭到一击即破的事实，向全世界清楚地表明了中华人民共和国的伟大民族团结是牢不可破的。
    评论又说，这是对疯狂企图从中国人民内部进行破坏和瓦解的帝国主义者的又一个巨大打击。
      “劳动新闻”评论指出，无论什么人如果要对这个完全是中国内政的事件进行无耻的干涉，那末，它将不可避免地遭到更加可耻的失败。
    评论又说：“这次清除西藏叛乱分子，进一步加强了中国人民内部的民族团结，并为西藏历史发展翻开了新的一页。”
      “民主朝鲜报”在有关西藏叛乱的评论中也指出，帝国主义者和它的走卒不可能使西藏倒退。
    评论说，中华人民共和国国务院28日发布的命令，最后粉碎了帝国主义者和它的走卒——西藏上层反动集团——要迫使西藏人民重新过中世纪的奴隶生活的无耻的阴谋行动。
    报纸的评论指出，这是在西藏建立和平和民主秩序的最切实的措施。
    评论谴责美国对中华人民共和国内政的粗暴干涉行为。评论说，美国国务院还对中国政府对叛乱集团的罪行采取的正当措施发表正式声明加以诽谤，这是不可容忍的事情。
