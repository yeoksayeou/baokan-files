To the Editors:

Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the People's Liberation Army and the working personnel entering Tibet have earnestly implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement, respecting the customs and habits and religious freedom of the Tibetan people. However, the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, colluding with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, undermined the Seventeen-Article Agreement and launched a full-scale armed rebellion. Indian expansionists took the opportunity to stir up trouble, took advantage of the chaos, distorted the truth, and slandered our suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, fabricating fallacies such as Tibetan "independence," religious unfreedom, violation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and that Tibetans are different from Han people, frantically interfering in our internal affairs.

The wise eyes of the Tibetan people can see very clearly that the so-called statement of the Dalai Lama disseminated by Indian diplomatic officials is entirely something imposed on the Dalai Lama, with the intention of splitting the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and turning Tibet into a colony of India.

Most intolerable is that Indian reactionary elements, with the connivance of the police, dared to insult the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao. All of the above facts are related to India, and can also be said to be related to Indian Prime Minister Nehru, because he has a two-faced way of speaking, on the one hand expressing adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but on the other hand saying he "sympathizes with Tibet." He is actually supporting Indian expansionists and Tibetan armed rebels. From this, it can be seen that India harbors ulterior motives and wants to split Tibet away and turn it into its colony. According to the documents seized by our army from the Tibetan rebel headquarters, it is further confirmed that the Dalai Lama was abducted and taken away, and not as the Indian expansionists rumored, that he went to India voluntarily. It also further confirms that the rebels have connections with Indian expansionists. Facts speak louder than words. Let us give some practical examples:

In Gyantse, Tibet, there is a temple. In front of the temple is a "mandang" (a Tibetan place for storing old scriptures and Buddha statues), which is a necessary place for building a motor road. According to the situation, it needed to be demolished. However, in order to respect the religious freedom of the Tibetan people, not only was it not demolished, but it was also repaired, making it even more beautiful than before. As a result, the motor road was built around both sides of the temple. Can it be said that the Chinese Communist Party does not respect Tibetan customs and habits and religious freedom?

When building the road in Gyantse, under the instruction of the upper-class reactionary elements, the Khenpo of the Gyantse Temple used people to bury the Buddha statues in the soil, falsely claiming that it was done by the Han people, in order to provoke ethnic relations.

Now, some reactionary elements in Kalimpong, India, live there and carry out activities to undermine the unification of the motherland, and the Indian government does not care. Can it be said that India respects the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and cherishes the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indian peoples?

Here, we seriously warn the Indian expansionists that Tibet will always be China's Tibet, and the Tibetan people will always be a nationality of China. No one can sow discord in the relationship of our national family. We cannot tolerate the interference and sabotage of expansionists. Since the liberation of Tibet, we have deeply felt that the Tibetan people can only develop and prosper under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the support of the Han elder brother. Any imperialist schemes of division are destined to fail and be in vain. Indian expansionists, you should clear your heads and stop being obsessed.

### 佛教徒的慧眼看穿了干涉者的灵魂  民族团结天高地厚扩张分子枉费心机

    佛教徒的慧眼看穿了干涉者的灵魂
    民族团结天高地厚扩张分子枉费心机编辑同志：
    自西藏和平解放以来，进藏人民解放军及工作人员认真执行了十七条协议，尊重藏族的风俗习惯和宗教自由。可是西藏上层反动分子勾结了帝国主义和蒋匪帮破坏了十七条协议，发动了全面的武装叛乱，印度的扩张主义分子借机兴风作浪，趁火打劫，歪曲真相，污蔑我们平息西藏叛乱，制造说什么西藏“独立”、宗教不自由、破坏十七条协议、西藏人不同于汉人等谬论，疯狂地干涉我国内政。
    西藏人的慧眼是看得十分清楚的，印度外交官员散发的所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，完全是强加在达赖喇嘛身上的东西，其用意在于分裂我国各族人民的团结，使西藏变成印度的殖民地。
    最令人不能容忍的是印度反动分子在警察的纵容下，竟敢污辱我们伟大的领袖毛主席像。所有以上这些事实与印度有关，也可以说与印度总理尼赫鲁有关。因他有两面的说法，一方面表示遵守五项原则，可是另一方面却又说什么“同情西藏”，他实际是支援了印度扩张主义分子和西藏的武装叛乱分子。由此可见印度是别具野心的，是想把西藏分裂出去变为他的殖民地的。按我军所缴获西藏叛匪司令部的文件，更证实了达赖喇嘛是被劫持而去，并非如印度扩张主义分子造谣所说的，他去印度是自愿的。也更证实了叛匪同印度扩张主义分子是有联系的。事实胜于雄辩，让我们举一些实际例子吧：
    西藏江孜有一个庙，庙前有一个满当（藏族堆放旧经卷佛像的），是修汽车路必经之地。根据情况，需要拆除，可是，为了尊重藏族的宗教自由，不但没有拆除，又给修补，较前更为美观，结果汽车路绕着庙的两旁修过去。这能说是中国共产党不尊重藏族风俗习惯和宗教自由吗？
    在江孜修路时，在上层反动分子指示下，江孜庙的堪布用人把佛像埋在土里，诬称是汉人做的，挑拨民族关系。
    现在印度噶伦堡有些反动分子住在那里进行破坏祖国统一的活动，印度政府不管，这能说是印度尊重和平共处的五项原则和珍惜中印人民的友好关系吗？
    我们在这里严重的警告印度扩张主义分子，西藏永远是中国的西藏，西藏人民永远是中国的一个民族，任何人都不能挑拨离间我们民族大家庭的关系，我们不能容忍扩张主义分子的干涉和破坏。在西藏解放以来，我们深深感觉到西藏民族只有在中国共产党的领导下，汉族老大哥的支援下，才能得到发展和繁荣。任何帝国主义的分裂阴谋，都是注定要失败和枉费心机的。印度的扩张主义分子们，你们还是清醒一下头脑吧，别再执迷不悟了。
