Sanmenxia's Great Changes
Speech by Representative Wang Huzhen

Fellow Representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." I suggest the Congress adopt them.

The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub is growing rapidly. It is expected that the civil engineering work will be completed by National Day next year, two years ahead of schedule. I would like to report on the leap forward situation.

	Rock Breaking, Sky Startling, Heroes Laugh
	Cars and Horses Busily Build the Dam

The construction of this project, along with the comprehensive soil and water conservation work in various provinces of the Yellow River basin and the construction of other reservoirs on the Yellow River's main stream and tributaries, will transform the Yellow River from a river of harm into a river of benefit, appearing on the Chinese mainland with a new face.

At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress held in July 1955, the representatives solemnly raised their hands to approve the "Resolution on the Comprehensive Plan for Eliminating the Yellow River's Water Hazards and Developing the Yellow River's Water Conservancy." Since then, the construction of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub has been placed on the agenda of China's socialist economic construction.

On April 13, 1957, in the ancient and secluded Sanmenxia Valley, the first shot to conquer the Yellow River, a rock-breaking, sky-startling event, rang out, proclaiming the beginning of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub project to all of China and the world.

The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub is a comprehensive water conservancy construction project. People from all over the country are building a concrete dam over 110 meters high and over 960 meters long in the Sanmenxia section of the Yellow River, creating a large reservoir with a capacity of 35 billion cubic meters to achieve the goals of flood control, sediment retention, power generation, irrigation, and navigation.

Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central Government, and with the technical assistance of the Soviet Union, the builders of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub have, after more than two years of effort, forced the Yellow River to relinquish its riverbed, which it had exclusively occupied for hundreds of millions of years, for people to build a dam, while it obediently flows out from completely human-controlled sluice gates. Now, thousands upon thousands of workers, day and night, are pouring large amounts of concrete to build the dam body. They have the confidence and determination to build the dam body to an elevation of 310 meters above sea level before the flood arrives in June this year, so that the largest flood since hydrological records began (the Yellow River has hydrological records for 40 years) can have its peak flow reduced by 40%, alleviating the tense situation of the Yellow River dikes during the flood season. It is expected that by the end of August next year, the dam body will be raised to an elevation of 336 meters above sea level, so that even if the Yellow River experiences a major flood that occurs only once in a thousand years, it can be contained in the reservoir, preventing the downstream flow from exceeding 6,000 cubic meters per second. All civil engineering work is scheduled to be completed before National Day next year, with the dam top rising to an elevation of 353 meters.

The builders of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub are launching a full-scale production upsurge with high morale. Trains loaded with sand, gravel, and cement continuously pass through the Longhai Railway to reach the construction site. These raw materials are mixed by automated mixing buildings to make concrete, which is transported to the dam site by a fleet of self-unloading trucks like cars and horses in a long line. A group of cranes with long arms hoist the concrete into the air and pour it into the wooden molds of the dam body. Workers work in three shifts, non-stop, 24 hours a day. The dam site is covered with clusters of square box-shaped concrete platforms, much like the tall buildings being built in front of Tiananmen Square. In these tall, box-shaped wooden molds, workers are busy using vibrators to vibrate the still-wet concrete, expelling the air bubbles it contains to make it fully dense. Currently, the monthly concrete pouring volume has increased from tens of thousands of cubic meters to over 100,000 cubic meters, and there is a tendency for it to increase even more in the future. Pouring 100,000 cubic meters of concrete per month is already a fairly high construction speed in China. If this speed were used to build the dam of the Foziling Reservoir, it would only take two months to complete. Building the dam of the Meishan Reservoir would not take more than two and a half months.

Achieving such a high construction speed is not a sudden miracle, but the result of several years of steady preparation. Because large-scale construction requires the use of a large number of machines. If these machines are not connected into an organic whole, high-speed production will be unimaginable. The people building Sanmenxia habitually call the two major construction systems on the construction site that are connected end-to-end—the concrete production system and the machinery manufacturing and maintenance system—two dragons. It is not a simple matter to make these two dragons lively dance and continuously produce. For these two dragons, the people building Sanmenxia have, over the past two to three years, opened up wastelands among the mountains, built 50 kilometers of railways, 56 kilometers of highways, 360,000 square meters of production and living houses, 111 kilometers of water pipes, 223 kilometers of transmission lines, installed 263 large and small machines, 877 tons of metal structures, and manufactured 1,560 machine parts. Not only that, but from 1956 to 1958, they excavated 9.23 million cubic meters of earthwork and 2.32 million cubic meters of rock, and poured 430,000 cubic meters of concrete. Especially important is that, through more than two years of engineering practice, Sanmenxia has trained a construction team of more than 20,000 people to undertake and complete this arduous task. Without these preparations and an organized labor army, high-speed construction would be impossible.

The Sanmenxia cutoff work last winter was completed quickly in a short time of only thirteen days and twenty-three hours, sixteen days and four hours ahead of schedule, which shows the strength of the Sanmenxia labor army and mechanized construction.

	The Dark Riverbed for Ten Thousand Ages
	Bedrock Comes Out of the Water, Sees the Light of Day

The cutoff was originally the key work in the Sanmenxia construction. Without completing the cutoff, the Yellow River would never relinquish its old home for people to build, and the dam would never be completed. But the cutoff can only be carried out during the winter dry season, there is only a short time each year, and once the opportunity is lost, it must wait until next year. The Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau Committee of the Communist Party of China determined in February last year to make the cutoff the central task of 1958, and did a lot of ideological education work to make everyone understand the importance of the cutoff, and not to miss the once-a-year opportunity. In June, the Party Committee decided to set up a cutoff preparation working group to specifically carry out and check all the preparation work related to the cutoff, and entrusted Jiaotong University to conduct hydraulic model tests. By mid-October, the preparation work was largely completed, and various mechanical operations were practiced in order to gain experience.

It was originally planned to wait until the Yellow River flow dropped to 1,000 cubic meters per second before starting the cutoff. But last year was a high-water year, and by mid-November, the flow had not receded, but remained at around 2,000 cubic meters per second. If we waited any longer, it would soon rain and snow, and the river would be full of ice, making the work difficult and dangerous. The Party Committee decided to start the actual cutoff exercise at Shenmenli at 9:00 a.m. on November 17 for three days. At that time, the Yellow River flow was 2,030 cubic meters per second, more than double the plan, but the work was very good during the exercise. In order to achieve a complete success, it was immediately decided to officially start the cutoff.

During the cutoff process, the water level difference between the upstream and downstream of Shenmen was huge, reaching a maximum of 2.93 meters, and the water flow was rapid, like ten thousand horses galloping down, with a maximum flow velocity of 6.86 meters per second. But the people building Sanmenxia were full of enthusiasm, indomitable, day and night, fighting bravely with the Yellow River. After cutting off the main stream of Shenmen, they continued to cut off the discharge channels of Shendao and the two major chutes of Guimen. Finally, they successfully made the Yellow River obediently flow out through the human-controlled sluice gates.

With the successful completion of the cutoff, the overall work outlook and people's mental state have been greatly changed. All the staff and workers were full of fighting spirit, displayed soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, and showed the heroic spirit of the working class. In a very short period of time, they completed the upstream and downstream cofferdams on the right bank and pumped out the water in the foundation pit. The bedrock at the bottom of the Yellow River had been scoured by rapid currents since ancient times, forming deep grooves up to 20 meters deep. It was full of silt and jagged rocks, and mechanical dredging was powerless. All the staff and workers used their hands and shoulders, carrying out all the silt basket by basket, and even cleaning the stone crevices to expose fresh bedrock as the foundation of the concrete dam. The dark riverbed of the Yellow River for ten thousand ages saw the light of day for the first time.

	Ten Thousand Year Plan, Good Quality
	Saving Everywhere, Low Cost

The people building Sanmenxia not only achieved high-speed construction, but also won victories on the quality and saving fronts. They understood that the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is a unified whole, and we cannot unilaterally seek more and faster, but must also simultaneously seek better and more economical. The Soviet experts on the construction site especially helped them to find ways to improve the quality of the project at any time and in any place. After a long period of inspection and physical testing, it can be proved that the quality of the Sanmenxia project meets the standard requirements. They will continue to gradually improve the quality in the future to conform to the spirit of "ten thousand year plan, quality first."

The average cement consumption per cubic meter of concrete in Sanmenxia has been reduced to 125 kilograms, and is moving towards the goal of 100 kilograms. This is an important victory on the saving front. The reduction in cement consumption not only saves a valuable material in the country's basic construction, but also reduces the amount of chemical heat emitted by the concrete when it solidifies, which is enough to improve the quality of the concrete, which is actually a good way to kill two birds with one stone. The reason why the cement consumption of Sanmenxia concrete can be reduced is the result of many aspects of effort and long-term scientific research. The main measures include proportioning the sand and stone used to make concrete in appropriate proportions, using fly ash from the Luoyang and Zhengzhou thermal power plants and local loess to replace part of the cement, using waste liquid from paper mills to increase the plasticity of the concrete, and throwing in part of the rubble to reduce the amount of concrete. It has recently been successfully tested that the minimum cement consumption per cubic meter of concrete only needs 87 kilograms, which is the beginning of further saving cement in the future.

Due to the reduction in cement consumption and other multi-faceted saving measures, the cost of Sanmenxia Dam concrete in 1959 has been reduced by 42% compared to 1958.

Sanmenxia takes improving labor efficiency, increasing production, practicing strict economy, and opposing waste as the central link of the mass movement. Therefore, the cost of all construction and installation projects is constantly decreasing. In the first quarter of 1958, the cost still exceeded the quota by 32.24%, but from the second quarter, the situation of exceeding the quota was reversed, and it became a saving. It is estimated that the second quarter saved 10.72%, the third quarter saved 2.35%, and the fourth quarter saved 6.9%. After entering 1959, the monthly cost decreased more significantly. It is estimated that the cost decreased by 12.3% in January, 16.9% in February, and 24.7% in March.

While completing the task of the Sanmenxia project, they implemented the spirit of the Party's communist large-scale collaboration and vigorously supported the engineering construction of various brother units. In 1958 alone, 374 cadres and technical personnel were transferred, and 1,275 workers were transferred, including 900 skilled workers. A total of 291 units or sets of construction equipment were transferred. It is believed that this support in manpower and material resources will play a certain positive role in the engineering construction of various brother units.

Defects were also discovered in the process of the Sanmenxia project in practice. The people building Sanmenxia are correcting their shortcomings at any time and in any place with a spirit of not being arrogant or impetuous and a serious attitude, and turning bad things into good things.

The construction of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub is a great and glorious task. The builders of Sanmenxia will resolutely work hard, do practical work, and do clever work under the leadership of the Party and the government, continuously innovate technology, learn advanced experience, and make the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub project grow day by day, and strive to successfully complete all civil engineering work by National Day next year.

    三门峡巨变
    汪胡桢代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意与拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告、李富春副总理所作“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理所作“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”、彭真副委员长所作“全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告”，建议大会予以通过。
    三门峡水利枢纽现在正在迅速成长，预计明年国庆节土建工程即可全部告成，比预定计划提早两年。我准备报告一下跃进的情况。石破天惊英雄笑车水马龙筑坝忙
    这个工程的兴建，连同黄河流域各省全面展开的水土保持工作和黄河干支流其他水库的建设，将使黄河从害河一变而为利河，以新的面貌出现于中国大陆。
    第一届全国人民代表大会在一九五五年七月举行的第二次会议里，代表们庄严地举手通过了“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划”的决议，从此以后，三门峡水利枢纽的建设就被提到了我国社会主义经济建设的日程上。
    一九五七年四月十三日在古来幽静的三门峡山谷里响起了石破天惊征服黄河的第一炮，就以三门峡水利枢纽工程的开端昭告全中国与全世界。
    三门峡水利枢纽是一个综合利用的水利建设事业。从全国四面八方来的人们正以双手在黄河三门峡里建造起高一百一十余公尺，长九百六十余公尺的混凝土拦河大坝，造成容量达三百五十亿立方公尺的大水库，用来达到防洪、拦沙、发电、灌溉、通航诸目标。
    三门峡水利枢纽的建设者们在中国共产党、毛主席和中央政府的正确领导下，结合苏联的技术援助，经过两年多的努力，已经迫使黄河让出了它千百万年来唯我独尊的河床，供人们建造拦河坝，而自己却驯服地从完全由人操纵的泄水闸孔里流出。现在，上千上万的工人们，不分白天，黑夜，正用大量的混凝土浇筑拦河坝的坝身。他们有信心和决心要在今年六月底洪水到来以前把坝身建筑到海拔三百一十公尺的高程，使再度出现自有水文记录（黄河有水文记录四十年）以来最大的洪水可以减去洪峰流量百分之四十，减轻黄河堤防在汛期里的紧张局势。预计到了明年八月底要把坝身提高到海拔三百三十六公尺，即使黄河发生千年少有的大洪水，也可容纳在水库里，不使下泄流量超过六千秒公方。全部土建工程已预定在明年国庆节以前告成，坝顶升高到海拔三百五十三公尺。
    建设三门峡水利枢纽的人们正以昂扬的斗志掀起全面的生产高潮。一列列满载沙石与水泥的列车接连地通过陇海铁路到达工地。这些原料经过自动化的拌和楼加以搅拌，制成混凝土，由车水马龙那样的自卸汽车队把混凝土运往坝址，更由一群伸着长臂的起重机把混凝土吊到空中，倾泻到坝身的木模里。工人们分三班轮流工作，二十四小时内分秒不停。坝址上布满一簇簇方盒形的混凝土高台，很像天安门前正在建筑的高楼大厦。在这些高台形的木模里，工人们忙着用振动器振捣还很潮湿的混凝土，驱出其中所含的空气泡，使它充分密实。目前每月混凝土的浇筑量已从几万公方发展到十万公方以上，今后还有越增越多的趋势。每个月浇筑十万公方的混凝土已经是我国目前相当高的施工速度了。如果用这个速度来建造佛子岭水库的大坝，只要两个月便可完成，建造梅山水库的大坝，也不会超过两个半月。
    达到这样高的施工速度并不是突然出现的奇迹，而是两三年来沉着进行了许多准备工作的结果。因为大规模的施工必须动用大量的机械。要求这些机械互相配合，协同工作，如果不把这些机械连接成为一个有机体，高速度生产将是不可想像的。建设三门峡的人们习惯地称呼工地上首尾衔接的两大套施工系统——混凝土生产系统和机械制造维修系统——为两条龙。要使这两条龙能够活泼飞舞，不断生产，不是一桩简单的事。两三年以来建设三门峡的人们为了这两条龙，已经在丛山峻岭间，开辟草莱，建成了铁路五十公里，公路五十六公里，生产和生活用房屋三十六万平方公尺，风水管路一百一十一公里，输电线二百二十三公里，安装了大小机器二百六十三台，金属结构八百七十七吨，制造了机件一千五百六十项。不仅这些，他们还从一九五六年起到一九五八年间，开挖了土方九百二十三万公方，开挖了岩石二百三十二万公方，浇筑了混凝土四十三万公方。尤其重要的，三门峡在两年多的工程实践中已经练成一支二万余人的施工队伍来担当与完成这艰巨的任务。没有这些准备工作和有组织的劳动大军，要求高速度施工是不可能的。
    去年冬季三门峡截流工作只用了十三天又二十三小时的短时间迅速完成，比设计的时间提前了十六天又四小时，可以显示出三门峡劳动大军和机械化施工的力量。万古幽暗黄河底基岩出水见天光
    截流原是三门峡施工中的关键工作。不完成截流，则黄河将永远不会让出它的老家给人们施工，拦河坝就永远完不成。但截流只能在冬季枯水时期里进行，一年只有一个短暂的时间，机会一失，便须等到明年。中共三门峡工程局委员会在去年二月里就确定以截流为一九五八年的中心任务，做了许多思想教育工作，使人人了解到截流的重要性，不许坐失一年一度的机会。六月党委又决定成立截流准备工作小组专门进行和检查有关截流的一切准备工作，委托交通大学举行水工模型试验。到十月中旬准备工作大致就绪，又为了取得经验，进行了各种机械操作的演习。
    原来计划要等到冬季黄河流量落到一千秒公方时才开始截流。但去年是一个丰水年，到十一月中旬，流量退不下去，还保持在二千秒公方上下。如果再事等待，则不久雨雪交加，满河冰块，工作起来将很艰难而危险。党委乃决定从十一月十七日上午九时起在神门里进行实际截流演习三天。那时黄河流量为二千零三十秒公方，超过计划一倍余，但在演习中，工作情形十分良好。为了一气呵成起见，当即决定正式开始截流。
    在截流过程中，神门上下游水位悬殊，最甚时相差达二点九三公尺，水流迅急，如万马奔腾而下，最大流速，每秒钟达六点八六公尺。但建设三门峡的人们干劲冲天，不屈不挠，夜以继日，与黄河奋勇斗争。截住神门主流以后，继续截断神岛的泄流道和鬼门两大溜。最后胜利地使黄河驯服地经过人们控制的闸孔里而流出。
    随着截流的胜利完成，大大改变了全局的工作面貌和人们的思想精神。全体职工斗志昂扬，发挥了冲天的革命干劲，表现出工人阶级的英雄气概。在很短的时间里完成右岸上下游的横围堰，抽干基坑里的积水。黄河河底岩石由于远古以来给急流冲刷，已成深槽，深达二十余公尺。其中满布淤泥，又有嶙峋巉岩，机械疏浚无能为力。全局职工即用双手两肩，一筐一筐地把全部淤泥挖出去，甚至石缝中也剔洗干净，露出新鲜的基岩，作为混凝土坝的基础。万古幽暗的黄河底才第一次见到了天光。
    万年大计质量好处处节约成本低
    建设三门峡的人们不仅做到高速施工，也在质量和节约战线上打了胜仗。他们了解到多快好省建设社会主义的总路线是统一体，不能片面地求多求快，而必须同时要好要省。在工地的苏联专家们尤其随时随地帮助他们设法提高工程质量。经过长时期的检查和实物试验，可以证明三门峡工程质量是达到标准要求的。他们今后还在逐步提高质量，以符合“万年大计，质量第一”的精神。
    三门峡平均每公方混凝土的水泥用量已经降低到一百二十五公斤，正向一百公斤的目标而迈进。这是节约战线上重要胜利的一项。水泥用量的减少，不但是节约了国家基本建设上一宗宝贵的材料，而且也使混凝土在凝固时少发一些化学热，足以提高混凝土的质量，实际上是一个一举两得的好办法。三门峡混凝土的水泥用量所以能够降低是多方面努力和长时间科学研究的结果。其中主要措施为按着适当的比例配合制造混凝土所用的沙、石，为利用洛阳和郑州火电厂所出的粉煤灰和当地的黄土来代替一部分的水泥，为采用造纸厂的废液来增加混凝土的塑性，为抛填一部分毛石来减少混凝土的数量。最近已经试验成功，每公方混凝土最少水泥用量只须八十七公斤，为今后更进一步节约水泥的开端。
    由于水泥用量的减低和其他多方面节约的措施，一九五九年三门峡大坝混凝土的成本已比一九五八年降低到百分之四十二。
    三门峡以提高劳动率，增加生产，厉行节约，反对浪费作为群众运动的中心环节，因此全部建筑安装工程都在不断地降低成本。一九五八年第一季度成本还是超过定额百分之三十二点二四，但从第二季度起即扭转超额的局面，一变而为节约。计第二季度节约百分之十点七二，第三季度节约百分之二点三五，第四季度节约百分之六点九。进入一九五九年后，每月成本更显著降低。计一月份降低百分之十二点三，二月份降低百分之十六点九，三月份降低百分之二十四点七。
    在完成三门峡工程任务的同时，他们贯彻党的共产主义大协作的精神，大力支援了各兄弟单位的工程建设。只一九五八年一年里，干部和技术人员已调出三百七十四人，工人调出了一千二百七十五人，其中技术工人九百人。在施工设备方面共调出二百九十一台或套。相信这些人力和物力的支援，对各兄弟单位的工程建设将会起一定的积极作用。
    三门峡工程在实践过程中也不是没有发现缺点的。建设三门峡的人们随时随地都以不骄不躁的精神和严肃的态度，改正缺点，化坏事为好事。
    三门峡水利枢纽的建设是伟大而光荣的任务。三门峡的建设者们将坚决地在党与政府的领导下以苦干、实干、巧干的精神，不断革新技术，学习先进经验，使三门峡水利枢纽工程一天一天成长起来，为明年国庆节胜利完成全部土建工程而奋斗。
