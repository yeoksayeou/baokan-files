Comrades,

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. I also fully endorse the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second CPPCC National Committee delivered by Vice Chairman Li Weihan at the First Session of the Third CPPCC National Committee.

In recent years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have made brilliant achievements in both socialist revolution and socialist construction. With the advancement of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the people's democratic united front has become even more consolidated and expanded. We must continue to unite closely around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and work with the people of the whole country to implement the general line of building socialism and to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the 1959 plan.

In his government work report, Premier Zhou put forward the tasks for the cultural and educational front in 1959, and also pointed out that in 1958, China's education not only made great progress in quantity, but also launched a huge and profound revolution due to the implementation of the Party's education policy. Now I would like to briefly report on the development of education in Hebei Province and focus on the role of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet in literacy campaigns and worker-peasant education.

　　Each team has a kindergarten, each village has a primary school, each commune has a junior high school, and each county has a senior high school.

Since 1958, under the brilliant light of the general line of building socialism, Hebei Province, like all brother regions across the country, has witnessed a huge leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Along with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, cultural and educational work has also made great progress. A high tide of cultural revolution has been set off throughout the province, and the face of education has undergone a fundamental change.

In terms of the development of education, due to the implementation of the mass line and the policy of walking on two legs, the entire Party and the entire people were mobilized to run education, and the development of education at all levels and in all categories showed an astonishing leap forward. In one year, more than five million people were eliminated from illiteracy (about two-thirds of them were consolidated), exceeding the total number of people made literate in the eight years since liberation. On the basis of literacy, spare-time schools for workers and peasants at all levels and part-work, part-study schools for workers have also greatly developed, with no less than three million people persisting in their studies. The ideal of universal education for the people of the province for many years has been initially realized, and the proportion of school-age children entering primary schools has reached 92.4 percent. The number of secondary school students increased by 45.9 percent over the previous year, absorbing 84 percent of the graduates of that year. Various types of professional education at all levels have also greatly developed: the number of secondary technical schools increased by more than 20 percent, the number of secondary normal schools increased by more than 60 percent, and the number of students in various colleges and universities increased by 77 percent, reaching more than 37,000. The development of preschool education is particularly prominent. With the great leap forward in production and the development of the people's commune movement, kindergartens have been generally established in the vast rural areas, and most of the children have entered kindergartens, totaling more than 3.7 million. We have now achieved that each team has a kindergarten, each village has a primary school, each commune has a junior high school, and each county has a senior high school, each special district has a normal college and other specialized schools, and there are spare-time schools everywhere, forming a nationwide upsurge of learning.

　　Being able to write and fight, being both red and expert, has become the goal of self-transformation.

While education is developing greatly, we have launched a new upsurge of educational revolution centered on the combination of education and productive labor, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The system of students participating in productive labor has been universally implemented in schools at all levels, overcoming or is overcoming the tendency of education to be divorced from politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality. Schools have run factories and farms on a large scale, and students have widely participated in social productive labor such as deep plowing and steelmaking, as well as various labor activities within the school, which has profoundly changed the atmosphere of the school. Through the combination of education and productive labor, students have been significantly improved in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical education. In the practice of labor and contact with the working people, the majority of teachers and students have gained more practical production knowledge, experienced the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and improved their socialist consciousness. Hard work and plain living have become a common practice, and "being able to write and fight" and "being both red and expert" have become the goals of people's self-training and self-transformation. Many teachers, through labor training, have begun to realize that theory must be linked to practice and that the idea of ​​underestimating practice is wrong. Many people are willing to go to factories and rural areas to participate in productive labor and social investigation activities. Some people have also combined teaching and scientific research in certain aspects in the practical activities of labor and investigation and research.

　　Using the Chinese phonetic alphabet as a weapon to eliminate illiteracy

In the literacy campaign and worker-peasant education, we used the Chinese phonetic alphabet as a weapon and achieved good results. This is a new experiment, and I would like to talk about this aspect.

After the National People's Congress approved the Chinese phonetic scheme last February, Hebei Province first carried out the teaching of the Chinese phonetic alphabet in normal schools, primary and secondary schools, and other schools. The students in the schools, especially the primary school students, generally learned very well, and played a good role in unifying pronunciation, promoting the standardization of Chinese, and improving the quality of Chinese teaching. However, whether it is suitable for workers, peasants, and masses, whether it is helpful to them in learning culture, and whether there are any difficulties in learning have not been resolved. When Comrade Wu Yuzhang came to Hebei Province for inspection in May, he suggested that we try to use the Chinese phonetic alphabet to help eliminate illiteracy and consolidate literacy achievements. Under the direct guidance of the Central Committee for the Reform of the Chinese Written Language, we conducted typical experiments in the Baoding Carpet Factory and Dongting Township in Ding County. The experiment proved that the Chinese phonetic scheme is welcomed by the masses. After learning the phonetic alphabet, it can indeed help them learn Chinese characters quickly and well; people with less literacy can also use the phonetic alphabet to take notes; in areas with relatively complex dialects, it can help learn Mandarin. The experiment also proved that it is not difficult for workers and peasants to learn the phonetic alphabet, and it generally takes eight to fifteen hours to learn it. Young people learn faster, of course, but it doesn't take too long for older people either. For example, Yang Runsheng, an old worker at the Baoding Carpet Factory who is already 54 years old, learned quickly and well. As some students said, "The phonetic alphabet is like window paper, which breaks with one poke."

In the pilot project, people who originally had very little literacy, because they mastered the method of using the phonetic alphabet to spell out Chinese characters, only used dozens of hours to recognize 1,500 to 2,000 Chinese characters and removed the hat of illiteracy. For example, after the workers of the Baoding Carpet Factory learned the phonetic alphabet, they studied the second and third volumes of literacy textbooks in eight days, and they were able to learn an average of 100 to 200 Chinese characters a day. With this tool, it is not only faster to learn, but also easier to review and remember firmly. Last year, Baoding City stopped studying for a period of time during the steelmaking campaign. After an investigation of seven people, five of them used the phonetic alphabet to help them become literate, and the other two used the method of homophones to directly learn Chinese characters to become literate. Among the five people who used the phonetic alphabet to help them become literate, there was a student named Yang Xiufen. Because she did not interrupt her self-study during the suspension of classes, not only did she not forget the Chinese characters she had learned during the test, but also increased the number of Chinese characters she recognized, and she could write every character; the other four students did not seize the opportunity to study on their own, forgot a part, but they used the phonetic alphabet to review, and learned the forgotten characters again in less than two weeks. In addition, the two students who used the homophone method to directly learn Chinese characters to become literate not only forgot a lot, but also found it difficult to review.

Many workers and farmers regard the phonetic alphabet as a non-speaking teacher who stays with them. After graduating from literacy classes, they often read books with phonetic notation, so that they not only consolidated the Chinese characters they had learned, but also constantly increased the number of Chinese characters they recognized. Facts have proved that the Chinese phonetic alphabet is an effective tool to help literacy.

The phonetic alphabet can also help students take notes or express their ideas. Many workers and peasants use the phonetic alphabet to write big-character posters and poems. For example, Cao Luofen, a member of the Party branch in Beixiashu Village, Wanxian District, Baoding City, is already 53 years old this year. He spent 20 days learning the phonetic alphabet. He often uses the phonetic alphabet to take notes and write poems. He once wrote such a poem:

　　My name is Cao Luofen, and I have been a hired laborer for eighteen springs.
　　The exploitation system is unbearable, and the class enemy is a wolf's heart.
　　The Communist Party came and we turned ourselves over, and the bitter people became happy people.
　　Agricultural leap forward and then leap forward, grain and cotton piled up and broke through the clouds.
　　The high tide of the cultural revolution is rising, and the Chinese phonetic alphabet is to my heart.
　　The old man also wants to learn culture, and devote himself to the motherland to repay the Party's grace.

This poem profoundly expresses the firm class stand of the workers and peasants and their true feelings of loving the Party and the motherland. It also shows that once the Chinese phonetic method is mastered by the workers and peasants, it will have a great effect in cultural learning.

In addition, promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet can also help promote Mandarin, which is conducive to work and production. Although the language of Hebei Province is close to Mandarin, there are still many differences in pronunciation and tone, and some local differences are still very large. For example, in some areas, "three" and "mountain" cannot be distinguished, and "four" and "yes" cannot be distinguished, which also brings some inconvenience to work, and even sometimes causes misunderstandings, causing losses to work. Therefore, it is necessary to learn and promote Mandarin, and learning the phonetic alphabet can create favorable conditions for learning Mandarin.

Some people had various concerns when they first started learning the phonetic alphabet, such as regarding the phonetic alphabet as foreign language, fearing that they would not be able to learn it, fearing that Chinese characters would be abolished, and fearing that dialects would be prohibited. However, after explanation and learning, these concerns can be quickly dispelled. After the pilot project, we summarized and promoted the pilot experience, and at the same time systematically trained a group of backbone teachers, preparing to further mobilize workers and peasants in more areas to learn the phonetic alphabet, so as to continue to help eliminate illiteracy, consolidate and expand literacy achievements. According to statistics, there are currently about 1 million workers and peasants in Hebei Province who are learning or have already learned the phonetic alphabet. Of course, this number is not large. In the future, we need to strengthen leadership, publicize in depth, and continue to train teachers and supply teaching materials and reading materials, so as to promote the Chinese phonetic alphabet more widely throughout the province. We firmly believe that the promotion of the phonetic alphabet will powerfully help consolidate and expand literacy achievements, further improve the cultural level of workers and peasants, and have a positive impact on the reform of the written language.

Over the past year or so, Hebei Province has made great achievements in education. All these achievements have powerfully proved that education, like other cultural undertakings, must establish and strengthen the leading position of the proletariat in all departments and units. Only by placing cultural and educational undertakings under the absolute leadership of the Party can we thoroughly eliminate the influence of all exploiting class ideas, so that culture and education can serve the working people and serve the cause of socialist construction, so that we can rapidly improve China's scientific and cultural level and realize a mass cultural revolution. Premier Zhou put forward major tasks for the cultural and educational front in his report, that is, "Continue to mobilize all positive factors on the cultural and educational front, advance the cause of cultural revolution, popularize socialist culture, and continuously consolidate and improve on the basis of popularization, so that the development of cultural and educational work can adapt to the needs of the entire socialist construction." We must go all out, strive for the top, and do our best to fulfill this task completely.

    河北省文化革命的高潮
    杨亦周委员的发言各位委员：
    我完全拥护在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上周总理所作的政府工作报告，和李富春副总理、李先念副总理所作的报告。我还完全拥护在第三届政协全国委员会第一次全体会议上李维汉副主席所作的第二届政协常务委员会的工作报告。
    几年来全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义革命方面和社会主义建设方面，都取得了辉煌的成就。随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的前进，人民民主统一战线也更加巩固和扩大了。我们一定要继续紧密地团结在共产党和毛主席的周围，和全国人民一道，为贯彻执行建设社会主义总路线，为完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的任务而努力。
    周总理在政府工作报告中，给我们提出了一九五九年在文化教育战线上的任务，同时指出在一九五八年我国教育事业不仅在数量上有很大发展，而且由于贯彻执行了党的教育工作方针，已经展开了巨大的深刻的革命。现在我想简要地汇报一下河北省教育事业发展的情况并着重地谈谈在扫盲和工农教育中推行汉语拼音字母的作用。
    队队有幼儿园村村有小学  社社有初中　县县有高中
    一九五八年以来，在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，河北省和全国各兄弟地区一样，工农业生产都有巨大跃进，随着工农业生产的大跃进，文教工作也有很大跃进，全省掀起了文化革命的高潮，教育工作面貌发生了一个根本变化。
    在教育事业的发展方面，由于贯彻执行了群众路线和两条腿走路的方针，发动了全党全民大办教育，各级各类教育的发展出现了一个惊人的跃进。一年中扫除了文盲五百多万（巩固下来的约占三分之二），超过了解放以来八年扫盲人数的总和。在扫盲的基础上，各级工农业余学校和职工中的半工半读学校也有很大发展，现在坚持学习的不下三百万人。全省人民多年普及教育的理想初步实现了，学龄儿童进入小学的比率达到百分之九十二点四。中等学校学生比前一年增长了百分之四十五点九，吸收了当年毕业生的百分之八十四。各级各类专业教育也有很大发展：中等技术学校发展了百分之二十以上，中等师范学校发展了百分之六十以上，各类高等学校在校学生增加了百分之七十七，达到三万七千多人。幼儿教育的发展是特别突出的，随着生产大跃进和人民公社运动的开展，幼儿园在广大农村中普遍建立了起来，大部分幼儿入了园，总数达三百七十多万。我们现在已经作到了队队有幼儿园，村村有小学，社社有初中，县县有高中，每个专区有师范学院和其他专科学校，到处有业余学校，形成了全民学习的热潮。
    能文能武又红又专  成为自我改造目标
    在教育事业大发展的同时，我们根据毛主席和党中央的指示，掀起了一个以教育与生产劳动相结合为中心的教育革命的新高潮。学生参加劳动生产的制度已在各级学校普遍实行，克服了或正在克服教育脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的倾向。学校大办工厂、农场，学生广泛参加了深翻土地、大炼钢铁等社会生产劳动和校内各种劳动，使学校风气发生了深刻的变化。通过教育与生产劳动相结合，使学生在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到了显著的提高。在劳动实践和同劳动人民的接触中，广大师生更多地掌握了实际生产知识，体会了劳动人民的思想感情，提高了社会主义觉悟。艰苦朴素成了普遍风尚，“能文能武”、“又红又专”成了人们自我锻炼和自我改造的目标。不少教师通过劳动锻炼，开始认识到理论必须联系实际，认识到轻视实际的思想是错误的，很多人愿意下厂下乡，参加生产劳动和社会调查等活动。有些人还在劳动和调查研究的实践活动中，在某些方面结合了教学和科学研究工作。
    运用汉语拼音字母  作扫除文盲的武器
    在扫盲和工农教育中，我们运用了汉语拼音字母来作为武器，收到了良好效果。这是一项新的试验，我想谈谈这方面的情况。
    去年二月，全国人民代表大会批准了汉语拼音方案以后，河北省首先在师范、中小学和其他一些学校中普遍进行了汉语拼音字母教学，学校的学生特别是小学生，一般都学得很好，对统一读音、促进汉语规范化和提高语文教学质量等方面都起了很好的作用。但是在工农群众中是否适用，对他们学习文化有无帮助以及在学习上有无困难等等一系列的问题，还没有得到解决。五月间吴玉章同志到河北省视察时，建议我们试用汉语拼音字母帮助扫盲和巩固扫盲成果。在中央文字改革委员会的直接指导下，我们在保定地毯厂和定县的东亭乡进行了典型试验。通过试验证明了汉语拼音方案是受群众欢迎的。在学会了拼音字母以后，确实能够帮助他们又快又好地学习汉字；识字少的人，还可以用拼音字母记事；在方言比较复杂的地方，可以帮助学习普通话。试验还证明了工农群众学习拼音字母并不困难，一般用八至十五小时就能够学会。青年人固然学得快些，年岁比较大的人，也用不到很长的时间，如已经五十四岁的保定地毯厂老工人杨润生学得很快而且很好。正如有的学员说：“拼音字母好像窗户纸，一戳就破”。
    在试点中原来识字很少的人，由于掌握了用拼音字母拼认汉字的方法，只用了几十个小时，就认到一千五百至二千个汉字，摘掉了文盲的帽子。如保定地毯厂的工人们在学会了拼音字母之后，八天就学习了二、三两册扫盲课本，平均一天能够学会一百到二百个汉字。有了这种工具不但学会的快，而且便于复习，记得结实。去年保定市在大炼钢铁时曾经停止了一个时期的学习，经过对七个人的调查，其中有五个人是用拼音字母帮助脱盲的，其余两人是用同音字的方法直接学习汉字脱盲的。在用拼音字母帮助脱盲的五人中，有一个学员叫杨秀芬，由于在停课期间没有间断自学，到测验时，不仅学过的汉字没有忘记，而且还增加了识字的数量，并且对每个字都会写；另外四个学员由于没有抓紧自学，忘掉了一部分，但是他们利用拼音字母进行复习，不到两周就把忘记的字又都学会了。另外用同音字方法直接学习汉字脱盲的两个学员，不但忘得多，而且在复习时也感到困难。
    许多工人和农民把拼音字母看成是跟在自己身边的不说话的老师。他们在扫盲结业以后，经常阅读带有注音的读物，这样，不但巩固了已经学会的汉字，而且识字的数量在不断增加。事实证明：汉语拼音字母是帮助识字的有效工具。
    拼音字母还可以帮助学员记事或表达思想。许多工农群众用拼音字母写大字报、写诗歌，如保定市完县区北下舒村的党支部委员曹洛芬同志，今年已经五十三岁了，用了二十天的工夫，学会了拼音字母，他经常用拼音字母作记录和写诗。他曾写过这样一首诗：
      我的名叫曹洛芬，扛了长工十八春。
      剥削制度真难忍，阶级敌人是狼心。
      共产党来了咱翻身，苦命人变成幸福人。
      农业跃进再跃进，粮棉堆起顶破云。
      文化革命高潮起，汉语拼音称我心。
      老汉也要学文化，尽忠祖国报党恩。
    这首诗深刻地表达了工农群众的坚定的阶级立场以及热爱党和祖国的真实心情，同时也说明了汉语拼音的方法，一旦为工农群众所掌握，在文化学习中便会收到极大的效果。
    此外，推行汉语拼音字母，还可帮助推广普通话，有利于工作和生产。河北省的语言虽然接近普通话，但在语音和声调方面仍然有不少差异，有的地方差异还很大。如有些地区“三”和“山”分不清，“四”和“是”分不清，也给工作带来一定程度的不方便，甚至有时发生误会，给工作造成损失。因此，学习和推广普通话是有必要的，而学习拼音字母则可以为学习普通话创造有利的条件。
    有些群众在开始学习拼音字母时，也曾有过种种顾虑，如把拼音字母看作是洋文，怕学不会，怕取消汉字，怕禁止方言等等，但经过解释和学习，这些顾虑是可以很快打消的。我们经过试点以后，对试点经验进行了总结和推广，同时有计划地训练了一批骨干教师，准备进一步在更多的地区发动工农群众学习拼音字母，用以继续帮助扫除文盲、巩固和扩大扫盲成果。据统计，目前河北省正在学习或已经学习拼音字母的工农群众约有一百多万人。当然，这个数字是不大的，今后需要对这一工作加强领导，深入宣传，并继续培训师资，供应教材读物，以便在全省范围内更加广泛地推行汉语拼音字母。我们深信拼音字母的推广，将有力地帮助巩固和扩大扫盲成果，进一步提高工农群众的文化水平并对文字改革产生积极的影响。
    一年多来，河北省在教育事业方面所取得的成绩是很大的。所有这些成绩都有力地证明了教育事业和其他文化事业一样，必须在各个部门和各个单位中确立和加强无产阶级的领导地位。只有把文教事业放在党的绝对领导下，才能彻底扫除一切剥削阶级思想的影响，才能使文化教育为劳动人民服务，为社会主义建设事业服务，才能迅速提高我国的科学文化水平，并实现群众性的文化革命。周总理在报告中对文教战线提出了重大任务，这就是“继续调动文教战线上的一切积极因素，向前推进文化革命的事业，普及社会主义的文化，并且不断地在普及的基础上进行巩固和提高的工作，使文教工作的发展能够适应整个社会主义建设的需要”。我们一定要鼓足干劲、力争上游，竭智尽忠，为彻底完成这一任务而努力。
