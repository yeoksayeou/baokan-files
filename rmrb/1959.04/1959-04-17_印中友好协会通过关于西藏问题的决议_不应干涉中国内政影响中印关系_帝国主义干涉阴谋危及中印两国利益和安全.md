Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 15th. The National Committee of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, at its meeting held in Baroda, Bombay State, on the 11th and 12th, passed a resolution on the Tibet issue. The resolution stated, "The National Committee notes that Tibet has always been a part of China, and the agreement signed between Tibet and the People's Republic of China in 1951 recognizes the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China over Tibet and guarantees internal autonomy for Tibet. Therefore, Tibet is an indivisible part of the People's Republic of China. The National Committee firmly believes that this relationship is most beneficial to China and Tibet and should be respected by all parties concerned."

The resolution stated that the National Committee fully agrees with and supports the policy adopted by India as clarified by Prime Minister Nehru. It welcomes the Indian government's insistence on non-interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China and its determination not to allow the Tibetan events to affect the long-standing friendly relations between the two great neighbors of China and India.

The resolution said that the National Committee is deeply disturbed by the news that the Chiang Kai-shek government, entrenched in Taiwan with the help of foreign bayonets, has had despicable intentions towards the developments in Tibet from the beginning and has been continuously supplying military materials to deal with the Chinese army. The National Committee also noted with concern that certain imperialist countries were gloating over this internal strife and even proposed to provide assistance. The National Committee believes that this is a serious violation of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries as embodied in Panchsheel.

The resolution pointed out that this interference by foreign imperialists in the affairs of the People's Republic of China not only endangers the interests and security of the People's Republic of China, including Tibet, but also endangers the interests and security of India. Therefore, the National Committee is convinced that on such a momentous issue, the People's Republic of China cannot risk tolerating such interference.

In its resolution, the National Committee stated that the Tibetan rebellion once again strongly demonstrates the urgent need to restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and to withdraw American troops from Taiwan. It said, "The National Committee urges all parties concerned to note that these long-standing and unresolved issues should be resolved without delay in accordance with the principles of international justice and the Charter of the United Nations." The resolution emphasized that the recent events in Tibet should not affect the friendly relations between China and India.

In its resolution, the National Committee called on all Indian people, especially the workers and leaders of various political parties, to continue to redouble their efforts to develop the friendship between China and India, to fight for the freedom and unity of the people of Asian and African countries, and to strive for world peace.

The resolution concluded by mentioning that the National Committee had decided to accept the invitation of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association to send a fifteen-member friendship delegation to visit China this summer.

　　印中友好协会通过关于西藏问题的决议
　　不应干涉中国内政影响中印关系
　　帝国主义干涉阴谋危及中印两国利益和安全
    新华社新德里15日电  印中友好协会全国委员会11日和12日两天在孟买邦巴罗达举行的会议上，通过了一项关于西藏问题的决议。这项决议说，“全国委员会注意到，西藏从来就是中国的一部分，1951年西藏和中华人民共和国之间签定的协议，承认中华人民共和国对西藏的宗主权，并保证西藏有内部自治权。因此西藏是中华人民共和国不可分割的部分。全国委员会深信，这种关系对中国和西藏最为有利，并且应当受到各有关方面的尊重。”
    决议表示，全国委员会完全赞同和支持尼赫鲁总理所阐明的印度所采取的政策，它对印度政府坚持不干涉中华人民共和国内政和决心不让西藏事件在任何方面影响中印两大邻邦之间历史悠久的友好关系的政策，表示欢迎。
    决议说，全国委员会对这样的消息深感不安：依靠外国刺刀的帮助而盘据在台湾的蒋介石政府，一开始就对西藏的事态发展怀着卑鄙的意图，并且源源供应军用物资来对付中国军队。全国委员会还不安地注意到，某些帝国主义国家对这个内部纷争欣喜若狂，甚至还提议要给予援助。全国委员会认为，这是对潘查希拉所体现的不干涉他国内政的原则的严重破坏。
    决议指出，外国帝国主义者对中华人民共和国事务的这种干涉，不仅危及包括西藏在内的中华人民共和国的利益和安全，而且危及印度的利益和安全。因此，全国委员会确信，在这种极其重大的问题上，中华人民共和国不可能冒任何危险来容忍这种干涉。
    全国委员会在决议中表示西藏的叛乱事件又一次强烈地表明，迫切需要恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位以及使美国军队撤离台湾。它说，“全国委员会敦促各有关方面注意，这些长期以来悬而未决的问题，应当刻不容缓地根据国际正义和联合国宪章的原则来加以解决”。决议着重指出，不应当让西藏最近发生的事件影响中印两国的友好关系。
    全国委员会在决议中呼吁全体印度人民，特别是各个政党的工作人员和领袖们继续加倍努力，为发展印中两国的友谊、为争取亚非国家人民的自由和团结，以及为争取世界和平而奋斗。
    决议最后还提到全国委员会决定接受中印友好协会的邀请，派遣一个由十五人组成的友好代表团，在今年夏天访问中国。
