    Commercial Departments Supply Means of Production
    The staff of the commercial departments in Changli County, Hebei Province, are currently actively transferring and supplying the means of production needed for spring ploughing, resolutely acting as the "logistics department" for spring ploughing.
    The commercial departments of this county, based on the principle of first mastering local sources of goods and then purchasing from other places, have adopted a series of measures such as conducting a thorough inventory of the means of production for spring ploughing and planting, organizing sources of goods, and clearing warehouses. To date, they have purchased 1.59 million jin of chemical fertilizer, 4.586 million jin of local fertilizer, 165,000 jin of seed dressing pesticides, 223 irrigation and drainage machines, 4,650 various waterwheels, more than 94,000 various small farm tools, and 40 head of draft cattle. At the same time, they have also tapped potential to solve the difficulties of insufficient means of production. For example, the supply and marketing cooperative of the Bohai Commune sent people to rural areas to collect old ropes for processing, solving the difficulty of insufficient ropes.
                                                                                (Li Yeshen)

    商业部门供应生产资料
    河北昌黎县商业部门职工，目前正在积极调运和供应春耕生产所需要的生产资料，坚决当好春耕生产的“后勤部”。
    这个县的商业部门，根据先掌握地方货源，后到外地采购的原则，采取了对春耕春种生产资料的摸底算账、组织货源、清仓排队等一系列办法。到目前为止，已采购了化肥一百五十九万斤，土化肥四百五十八万六千斤，拌种农药十六万五千斤，排灌机械二百二十三台，各种水车四千六百五十架，各种小农具九万四千多件，耕牛四十头。同时，还大挖潜力，解决了一些生产资料不足的困难。如渤海公社供销科，派人到农村收购旧绳子回来加工，解决了绳子不足的困难。
