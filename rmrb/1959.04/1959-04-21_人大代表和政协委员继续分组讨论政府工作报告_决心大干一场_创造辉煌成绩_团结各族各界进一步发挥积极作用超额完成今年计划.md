Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: The First Session of the Second National People's Congress continued its group discussions today on Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report."

    The deputies generally believed in their speeches that Premier Zhou Enlai's report greatly broadened their horizons and pointed out the glorious future of our country. They said that they were infinitely excited when listening to the report, and after the discussion, they felt open-minded and their confidence doubled. Many deputies wrote letters overnight to their colleagues in their units, expressing their determination to work hard this year and resolutely complete and overfulfill this year's national plan.

    Deputies from various industrial regions unanimously agreed in their speeches that to complete the huge tasks of industrial production and industrial construction stipulated in the national economic plan, it is necessary to emphasize strengthening centralized leadership and conduct comprehensive arrangements, first ensuring the needs of key enterprises and key construction projects. Hu Ming, Secretary of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the CPC, talked about the situation in Dalian in his speech, where the city concentrated all its efforts to ensure the completion of key tasks. He said that in order to accelerate the manufacturing of urgently needed machinery and equipment for the country, Dalian made reasonable arrangements among industrial enterprises throughout the city, mobilized the enthusiasm of all aspects of the city while appropriately taking care of the development of other industries, and thus smoothly completed the manufacturing of important equipment such as power stations and locomotives, and overfulfilled the city's industrial production plan for the first quarter. Representatives from enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, Shanghai Iron and Steel, Chongqing Iron and Steel, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel believed that in completing this year's production plan of 18 million tons of steel, the workers of various iron and steel enterprises, especially key iron and steel enterprises, bear extremely glorious and arduous tasks. They expressed their determination to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, launch high-yield and high-quality red flag competitions, continue to promote various effective advanced experiences, and ensure the completion of the steel production plan.

    Many deputies generally believed in their speeches that the most fundamental guarantee for completing this year's industrial production and construction plan is to implement the "walking on two legs" policy, earnestly implement the mass line method, and combine centralized leadership with the development of a vigorous mass movement. Wang Tao, a representative from Hubei Province and Dean of the Cement Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, cited the national cement production situation last year as an example to talk about the gains after implementing the "walking on two legs" policy. He said that last year, according to this policy, the simultaneous construction of large cement enterprises and medium and small cement enterprises was carried out, and the effect was very good. It not only improved the problem of insufficient cement supply but also quickly cultivated a large number of technical forces.

    Deputies from rural areas seriously discussed how agriculture can continue to leap forward. Guan Musheng, a national model worker and deputy director of the Pengxing People's Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, said that on the basis of summarizing and developing the experiences of 1958, comprehensively and rationally implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production and carrying out a vigorous large-scale high-yield movement is an important condition for continuing to realize the great leap forward in agriculture. He believes that the "Eight-Point Charter" should be generally mastered by the masses. The per-mu yield of rice in his people's commune had already reached about 1,000 jin the year before last, and last year it increased to 1,620 jin. This year, they are confidently determined to increase the per-mu yield to more than 2,500 jin. Su Dianxuan, a national famous agricultural labor model and deputy director of the Lushan People's Commune in Lushan County, Henan Province, said that in 1958, agricultural production in the Lushan People's Commune achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a per-mu yield of about 1,400 jin. This year, they will strive to reach 2,000 jin per mu.

    The army delegation was very excited about the achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year during the discussion. Zhang Lingbin, a representative, talked about the army's support for the construction of the motherland in terms of manpower and materials last year. He said that the army in some areas supported local industrial and agricultural construction with more than one million workdays and a large amount of materials last year. This year, the troops will continue to work hard to support the construction of the motherland. The representatives also talked about the achievements of the troops in training and consolidating national defense construction last year. They unanimously expressed their determination to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu; to further consolidate national defense, strengthen national defense construction, and defend the fruits of the peaceful labor of the people of the motherland.

    Many representatives from minority areas analyzed the various conditions for minority areas to strive for a greater leap forward this year in the discussion. They believed that the Party has unparalleled prestige among the minority nationalities, the Party's general line for socialist construction has been grasped by the vast number of minority cadres and masses, and after more than a year of the Great Leap Forward, minority cadres and minority workers with communist consciousness are growing in large numbers. Some representatives from Guizhou Province talked about the fact that a large number of minority farmers have now become workers who make steel and manufacture machines. Wangmo County, where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, could not even forge sickles and iron plows in 1957. This county only started making iron in the second half of last year, and this year it is already producing an average of more than 20 tons of pig iron per day. Among the more than 2 million women of all ethnic groups in Guizhou, 50% of young women have learned to use new farm implements, and 85% of the female labor force has mastered more than ten kinds of advanced agricultural production techniques. In Xuyong County, Sichuan, where ten ethnic groups live together, there is a 14-cubic-meter blast furnace combining indigenous and foreign methods, which has now reached a daily output of more than 30 tons of pig iron. Workers of all ethnic groups have put forward a heroic slogan to catch up with the highest production level of small blast furnaces in the country within April. Many representatives from minority areas have made detailed calculations in the discussion to strive for greater agricultural production this year.

    Many representatives from the cultural and educational circles have great confidence in the development and improvement of my country's cultural and educational undertakings in group discussions. Wu Ruo'an, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, said that Premier Zhou's report pointed out that we should conduct rectification, consolidation, and improvement on the basis of the great development of education last year, and pay special attention to improving the teaching quality of various schools, which is very correct. She said that this year Shanghai schools have made reasonable arrangements for teaching and productive labor and have made preparations for concentrating efforts to run a number of key schools well. Representatives from the literary and artistic circles talked about the vigorous and prosperous scene on the literary and artistic front in my country last year in their speeches. Lang Xianfen, a famous Lü opera actress from Shandong, said that the Shandong Lü Opera Troupe performed more than 800 shows last year, which is more than the total number of performances in the past five years. It also created more than 60 scripts and staged dozens of new plays. This year, they will continue to rehearse new plays on the basis of past achievements, reform and enrich the music of Lü opera, and welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day with more brilliant achievements.

    Some representative groups continued to discuss the sections of the report on the country's political life and foreign policy. They pointed out that our country is a unified country with many nationalities. Historically, Tibet has always been a part of China. The so-called Tibet being an "independent country" is actually an attempt to split Tibet from the big family of the motherland and turn it into a foreign colony or protectorate. The people of our country, including the Tibetan people, resolutely oppose this shameless conspiracy. The representatives warmly congratulated the victory in quelling the rebellion in Tibet and congratulated the new life of the Tibetan people.

    The representatives felt infinitely delighted with the current international situation of "the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day." Many representatives cited many specific examples in their speeches to illustrate the selfless help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts to our country's construction and expressed their heartfelt thanks. They also expressed their warm support for our government's diplomatic policy in the discussion and expressed their determination to further consolidate the strong unity between the people of our country and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, consolidate and develop the friendship between the people of our country and all peace-loving countries and people in the world, and resolutely fight against imperialist wars of aggression and defend world peace.

    The congress will hold a plenary session tomorrow afternoon.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: The First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference continued its group discussions today on Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report." In the discussions, the members were overjoyed and encouraged by the unprecedented unity and prosperity of the motherland's big family, and were full of confidence in realizing the continued great leap forward in 1959.

    The speeches were very enthusiastic in the discussion. The members' speeches involved all aspects mentioned in Premier Zhou's report. Some cited many examples of personal experiences to vividly depict the prosperity of the motherland, and some put forward specific suggestions on various tasks.

    Members of ethnic minorities from all parts of the motherland continued to use many moving examples to illustrate that under the leadership of the Communist Party and in the unified family of the motherland, ethnic minorities firmly take the bright road of socialism, and their lives are getting happier and happier. A member of the Kawa ethnic group said at the meeting that the Kawa people established people's communes in the Great Leap Forward last year, and production has greatly developed. In the old society, nine out of ten families did not have enough to eat, but now every family has enough to eat. Moreover, factories and mines have also been established. The members all said in their speeches that the Party's care for ethnic minorities is meticulous. This time they came to Beijing and saw that Chairman Mao was very healthy, and they believed that this was the happiness of the people of the whole country and also the happiness of ethnic minorities.

    People from various democratic parties expressed in group discussions that the motherland's Great Leap Forward and the unprecedented prosperity in all aspects have given them great encouragement. They are determined to accelerate ideological transformation, improve socialist consciousness, unite different social forces, and further play an active role in the motherland's rapid construction through the practice of serving socialism.

    People from various democratic parties also discussed the Tibet issue. They expressed extreme indignation at the crimes of the reactionary group in the upper echelons of Tibet in instigating the rebellion. They said that some people attempted to describe the Tibetan rebellion as a national issue or a religious issue in order to undermine the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. This is extremely absurd. The armed rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary elements has nothing to do with religious issues or national issues. The Tibetan rebellion is a criminal activity in which a small group of reactionary elements in Tibet colluded with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to carry out activities to split the motherland. Everyone warmly supported the government's various measures to quell the rebellion in Tibet proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai in his report.

    People from the business community believed in group discussions that after the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, they also strengthened their self-transformation through learning, work, and labor exercises in the Great Leap Forward last year, and made progress to varying degrees. They expressed that they would further strengthen self-education and self-transformation in labor and work practice according to the clear direction pointed out by Premier Zhou in his report on the continued transformation of people from the business community, and contribute their strength to the socialist construction cause.

    Female CPPCC members in group discussions reflected the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of women in the Great Leap Forward. They enthusiastically talked about that since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the communization of the people, women and children's welfare undertakings have flourished, and millions of women have been liberated from tedious housework, contributing tremendous strength to the motherland's construction cause. They expressed that they would further boost their energy, unite women from all walks of life, and strive to complete and overfulfill the grand plan for 1959.

    CPPCC members from the overseas Chinese community warmly praised the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year and praised the people's commune movement in the discussion. They all expressed that they would tell the good news of the motherland to overseas Chinese and better unite returned overseas Chinese and their relatives to participate in the socialist construction cause of the motherland. They also put forward many valuable opinions on how to develop the motherland's rich natural resources and develop forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery.

    The combination of education and productive labor has been the focus of heated discussions among people in the education field for the past two days. Many members pointed out that my country's education cause has not only leaped forward in quantity but also made great strides in quality. Due to the implementation of the Party's education policy, students' socialist consciousness has been significantly improved. They love labor, and their academic performance has also generally improved. Members put forward specific opinions on further implementing the Party's education policy in the discussion.

    Members from the medical and health fields discussed issues such as further studying the prevention and treatment of epidemic diseases, learning the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and attacking difficult diseases at the meeting. Some members also proposed research plans.

    CPPCC members from social science groups discussed the task of actively developing theoretical research work in the field of social sciences pointed out by Premier Zhou in his report. They said that social science theoretical workers must engage in independent and creative research, eliminate superstition, connect with reality, and do it wholeheartedly under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism.

    The members unanimously supported our government's foreign policy in the discussion. They felt extremely encouraged by the important development of our country in foreign relations in the past few years.

    Before discussing the Government Work Report, the members also discussed the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC made by Li Weihan and expressed their agreement with the report.

    人大代表和政协委员继续分组讨论政府工作报告
    决心大干一场　创造辉煌成绩
    团结各族各界进一步发挥积极作用超额完成今年计划
    据新华社20日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，今天继续分组讨论周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”。
    代表们在发言中普遍地认为：周恩来总理的报告，大大开阔了自己的眼界，指出了我们国家的辉煌前途。他们说，听这个报告时无限兴奋，讨论以后，心胸开朗，信心倍增。许多代表连夜把自己这种心情写信给本单位的同志们，表示今年决心要大干一场，坚决完成和超额完成今年的国家计划。
    来自各工业地区的代表，发言中一致认为，完成国民经济计划规定的工业生产和工业建设的巨大任务，必须强调加强集中领导，进行全面的安排，首先保证重点企业和重点建设项目的需要。中共旅大市委书记胡明代表在发言中谈到了旅大市如何集中全力保证完成重点任务的情况。他说，为了加快制造国家急需的机械设备，旅大市在全市工业企业中进行了合理的安排，在适当照顾其他工业发展的情况下，把全市各方面的积极性都调动起来，因而顺利地完成了电站、机车等重要设备的制造任务，全市第一季度的工业生产计划也超额完成。来自鞍钢、武钢、包钢、上钢、重钢、太钢等企业的代表认为，在完成今年一千八百万吨钢的生产计划中，各个钢铁企业特别是重点钢铁企业的职工，担负着极其光荣而又艰巨的任务。他们表示一定要大搞技术革新和技术革命，开展高产、优质的红旗竞赛，继续推广各种行之有效的先进经验，保证钢铁生产计划的完成。
    许多代表在发言中普遍认为，完成今年的工业生产和建设计划，最根本的保证是贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，认真贯彻群众路线的方法，使集中领导同开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动结合起来。湖北省代表、建筑工程部水泥研究院院长王涛，以去年全国水泥的生产情况为例，畅谈贯彻执行“两条腿走路”方针后的收获。他说，去年根据这个方针，办大型水泥企业和办中、小型水泥企业同时进行，效果很好，不仅改善了水泥供应不足问题，而且迅速地培养出了大批技术力量。
    来自农村的代表认真讨论了农业如何继续大跃进的问题。全国著名劳动模范、湖北省孝感县朋兴人民公社副社长官木生代表说，在总结和发展1958年经验的基础上，全面合理地贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”，开展轰轰烈烈的大面积丰产运动，是继续实现农业大跃进的重要条件。他认为，应该让“八字宪法”普遍为群众所掌握。他所在的人民公社的水稻亩产量在前年就已达到一千斤左右，去年又提高到一千六百二十斤。今年，他们满怀信心地决定要把每亩产量提高到二千五百斤以上。全国著名农业劳动模范、河南省鲁山县鲁山人民公社副社长苏殿选说，1958年鲁山人民公社农业生产获得空前大丰收，每亩产量达到一千四百斤左右，今年要争取达到每亩二千斤。
    军队代表小组在讨论中对去年大跃进的成就非常兴奋。张令彬代表谈到了军队去年在人力、物力等方面支援祖国建设的情况，他说，有些地区的军队去年以一百多万个工和大量物资支援了地方的工农业建设，今年部队将继续努力支援祖国的建设。代表们还谈到了部队去年在训练和巩固国防施工等方面的成就，他们一致表示一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖；要进一步巩固国防，加强国防建设，保卫祖国人民和平劳动的成果。
    许多少数民族地区的代表，在讨论中分析了今年少数民族地区争取更大跃进的各种条件，他们认为，党在少数民族中有着无比的威信，党的社会主义建设总路线已经被少数民族广大干部和群众所掌握，经过一年多来的大跃进，具有共产主义觉悟的少数民族干部和少数民族工人正在大量地成长。贵州省有些代表谈到这样的事实：大批的少数民族农民现在变成了炼钢铁和制造机器的工人，少数民族聚居的望谟县，1957年时连镰刀和铁犁都不能打制，这个县在去年下半年才开始炼铁，今年已经平均日产生铁二十多吨了。在贵州的两百多万名各族妇女中，已有50％的青年妇女学会使用新式农具，85％的妇女劳动力掌握了十种以上的先进农业生产技术。十个民族杂居的四川叙永县，有个洋土结合的十四立方公尺的高炉，现在已经达到日产生铁三十多吨，各族工人们提出了豪迈的口号，让高炉利用系数在4月以内赶上全国小高炉的最高生产水平。许多少数民族地区的代表在讨论中，都算了争取今年农业更大增产的细账。
    许多来自文教界的代表在小组讨论中，对于我国文教事业的发展和提高，具有很大信心。上海市教育局副局长吴若安代表说，周总理报告中指出我们要在去年教育事业大发展的基础上，进行整顿、巩固和提高，特别要注意提高各类学校的教学质量，是十分正确的。她说，今年上海的学校已对教学和生产劳动作了合理安排，并为集中力量办好一批重点学校作了准备。文学艺术界的代表们在发言中谈到了去年我国文艺战线上生气勃勃的繁荣景象。山东代表、著名的吕剧演员郎咸芬说：山东吕剧团去年一年中上演八百多场，比过去五年上演的总数还多，还创作了六十多个剧本，排了几十个新戏。今年他们将在过去成绩的基础上继续排演新戏，改革和丰富吕剧的音乐，用更加光辉的成就来迎接国庆十周年。
    一些代表小组继续讨论了报告中的关于国家的政治生活和对外政策部分。他们指出：我国是多民族的统一国家，历史上西藏一直是中国的一部分，所谓西藏是“独立国”的说法，实际上就是企图把西藏分裂出祖国大家庭，变成外国的殖民地或者保护国，我国人民包括西藏人民在内，坚决反对这种无耻阴谋。代表们热烈祝贺平息西藏叛乱的胜利，祝贺西藏人民的新生。
    代表们对于目前“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”的国际形势，都感到无限欢欣。不少代表在发言中列举了许多具体事例，说明了苏联政府和苏联专家对我国建设的无私帮助，并且对此表示衷心的感谢。他们在讨论中还表示热烈拥护我国政府的外交政策，决心进一步巩固我国人民同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大团结，巩固和发展我国人民同世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民的友谊，坚决为反对帝国主义侵略战争和保卫世界和平而斗争。
    明天下午，大会将举行全体会议。
    据新华社20日讯　政协第三届全国委员会第一次会议今天继续分组讨论周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”。委员们在讨论中，为祖国大家庭的空前团结和空前兴盛感到欢欣鼓舞，对实现1959年的继续大跃进充满信心。
    在讨论中，发言十分热烈。委员们的发言涉及了周总理报告中所谈到的各个方面，他们有的列举亲身经历的许多事例生动地描绘了祖国的繁荣景象，有的对各项工作提出了具体建议。
    来自祖国各地的少数民族委员，继续以许多动人的事例，说明少数民族在共产党的领导下，在祖国统一的大家庭中，坚决走社会主义的光明大道，日子越过越幸福。佧佤族的委员在会上谈到，佧佤族人民在去年大跃进中办起了人民公社，生产大大发展了。在旧社会里十家有九家不够吃，现在家家都够吃了。而且工厂矿山也兴办起来了。委员们在发言中都说，党对少数民族的关怀无微不至，这次他们到北京看到毛主席很健康，认为这是全国人民的幸福，也是少数民族的幸福。
    各民主党派人士在小组讨论中表示，祖国的大跃进和各方面的空前兴旺气象，给了他们很大的鼓舞，他们决心通过为社会主义服务的实践，加速思想改造，提高社会主义觉悟，团结不同的社会力量，在祖国一日千里的建设事业中进一步发挥积极的作用。
    各民主党派人士还讨论了西藏问题。他们对西藏上层反动集团的叛乱罪行表示极为愤慨。他们说，有些人企图把西藏叛乱问题说成是民族问题、宗教问题，来破坏我国各族人民的团结，这是极端荒谬的，西藏反动分子的武装叛乱与宗教问题、民族问题毫不相干。西藏叛乱是西藏一小撮反动分子勾结帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮进行分裂祖国的罪恶活动。大家热烈拥护周恩来总理在报告中所提出的政府关于平息西藏叛乱的各项措施。
    工商界人士在小组讨论中认为，经过整风运动和反右派斗争以后，他们在去年大跃进中也通过学习、工作和劳动锻炼，加强了自我改造，取得了不同程度的进步。他们表示要根据周总理在报告中对工商界人士的继续改造指出的明确方向，在劳动和工作实践中进一步加强自我教育和自我改造，为社会主义建设事业贡献出自己的力量。
  妇女界的政协委员在小组讨论中，反映了广大妇女在大跃进中表现出的冲天干劲，她们热情地谈到，从大跃进以来，特别是人民公社化以后，妇幼福利事业蓬勃发展，千百万妇女从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，为祖国建设事业贡献了巨大的力量。她们表示要进一步鼓足干劲，团结各界妇女，为完成和超额完成1959年的宏伟计划而奋斗。
    华侨方面的政协委员在讨论中热烈赞扬去年大跃进的伟大成就，赞扬人民公社运动。他们都表示要把祖国的喜讯告诉海外侨胞，并且要更好地团结归国华侨和侨眷参加祖国社会主义建设事业。他们还对如何开发祖国丰富的自然资源，发展林业、畜牧业、渔业等方面，提出了许多宝贵的意见。
    教育与生产劳动相结合是两天来教育界人士热烈讨论的中心。许多委员指出，我国教育事业不但在数量上跃进，在质量上也突飞猛进。由于贯彻党的教育工作方针，学生的社会主义觉悟显著提高了，他们热爱劳动，学习成绩也普遍提高。委员们在讨论中对进一步贯彻党的教育工作方针提出了具体意见。
    医药卫生界的委员在会上讨论了进一步研究防治流行性疾病、学习祖国医学遗产和猛攻疑难病症等问题，有的委员并且提出了研究规划。
    社会科学团体方面的政协委员们讨论了周总理在报告中指出的社会科学方面的理论研究工作应当积极发展的任务。他们说，社会科学理论工作者要从事独立的、创造性的研究，必须在马列主义思想的指导下，破除迷信，联系实际，并且要全心全意地去做。
    委员们在讨论中一致拥护我国政府的对外政策，他们对于几年来我国在对外关系方面的重要发展，感到极为振奋。
    在讨论政府工作报告以前，委员们还讨论了李维汉所作的政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，并表示同意这个报告。
