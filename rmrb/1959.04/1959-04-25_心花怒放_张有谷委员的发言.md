Heart Full of Joy
Speech by Committee Member Zhang Yougu

Fellow Representatives:

Premier Zhou's report summarized the great achievements of the First Five-Year Plan period and 1958. It presented the tasks for the entire people in 1959, indicated methods for completing those tasks, and analyzed the international and domestic situations, pointing out favorable conditions. This further strengthened our confidence in the great future and beautiful prospects of the motherland, inspired the emotions and drive of the 600 million people, and greatly strengthened the close unity of all nationalities and strata of people throughout the country. The impact of this report is so great that it will not only spread throughout the country but also throughout the world.

I would like to express my personal opinions as follows.

1958 was an extraordinary year, a year of overall great leap forward for the entire country. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the motherland, with an overwhelming heroic spirit, created unprecedented miracles of industrial and agricultural production increases that shocked the world. Steel production doubled, grain and cotton harvests were bountiful, and coal production leaped to exceed that of old-line capitalist Britain.

In the Great Leap Forward, a new social organization—the People's Commune—shone like the sun across the country. In just a few short months, this organization has already demonstrated its unparalleled superiority and strong vitality in all aspects.

Other fronts such as culture, education, health, transportation, commerce, national defense, have all achieved great results. It is truly the case throughout the country, without exception.

Take Mudanjiang City, where I live, which currently has a population of less than 300,000: In 1958, the industrial output value increased by 91 percent compared to 1957, grain production increased by 85.7 percent, and vegetable production increased by 211 percent. Two hundred and eighty-five new factories were built. Illiteracy among young and middle-aged people was eliminated, primary and secondary education was universalized, and the elimination of the four pests and the emphasis on hygiene basically achieved a city free of the four pests. In particular, in just a few months, 115 indigenous and modern blast furnaces, 15 converters, and 1 electric furnace were built from scratch, producing 6,538 tons of iron and 3,550 tons of steel.

In 1959, Mudanjiang City's industry will increase by 68.4 percent compared to 1958, steel production will increase by 69 percent, and iron production will increase by 664.8 percent. In 1959, aluminum will also be smelted, and 123 large, medium, and small factories will be newly built. Grain production will increase by 46 percent, and vegetable production will increase by 120 percent. For this city, these are such exciting figures.

As for the aviation school where I work, our training period has been shortened by one-third, while the number of graduates has doubled; flight time has quadrupled, and the quality has made a significant leap forward. These leap forward achievements throughout the country are the fruits of the Rectification Campaign and the Anti-Rightist Struggle and the result of the hard work of the people across the country. Ultimately, it is due to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao not only led the Chinese people to stand up, but also led our people to continue to work hard to gradually build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

The progress in all aspects and the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the ten years since the founding of the country are particularly sensitive and exciting to me, an old soldier who lived in the old society for more than forty years, once lost confidence in the country and the nation, only knew how to complain about the corruption of the Kuomintang, and could not find a correct and bright path and lived a muddled life. Now, wherever I go, there is magnificent construction, and wherever I look, there is soaring progress. Great ideals and beautiful prospects truly make my heart blossom with joy and my energy soar to the sky.

1959, the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, is a year of decisive significance in our three years of hard work. Thanks to the correct and wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and thanks to the full efforts of the 600 million people across the country, our motherland will develop even more rapidly this year. We will create more miracles, achieve more brilliant achievements, and achieve greater leaps forward in the cause of socialist construction.

Regarding the rebellion of a small handful of upper-class reactionary elements in the former local government of Tibet, I fully support the measures proposed by Premier Zhou in his report to quell the Tibetan rebellion. I fully believe that the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, in close cooperation with the patriotic people of Tibet, will quickly and thoroughly eliminate the remaining fleeing rebels.

This small handful of reactionary elements betrayed the motherland, committed rape, looting, arson, and murder, and attempted to reverse the wheels of history and permanently maintain the cruel exploitation of the Tibetan people under the feudal serf system. Such heinous crimes are absolutely intolerable to any Chinese person.

As Chairman Mao taught us to view problems dialectically, bad things can also turn into good things. This rebellion by a small handful of upper-class elements in the former local government of Tibet has first of all educated the more than one million people of Tibet. They have received a profound and practical education. They will be better at distinguishing right from wrong, better at distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, will implement national regional autonomy more quickly, and will leap from the feudal serf system to socialist society in one step, and will share the prosperous and happy socialist life led and organized by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao with the people of all nationalities across the country sooner and earlier.

On the other hand, the rebellion of this small handful of reactionary elements has served as a negative example for our people throughout the country. We have therefore further deepened our understanding that the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang never forget to sabotage our great socialist construction of the motherland. We must always and constantly heighten our vigilance, constantly prevent and resolutely crush the sabotage of class enemies. We must always be prepared to strive for the liberation of Taiwan, the territory of our motherland.

I personally also express that I will further strengthen my self-transformation politically and ideologically, absolutely obey the leadership of the Party, and always listen to the Party. I will also use my brain and use my hands to work with the people of the whole country to build our socialist, prosperous, and strong motherland that will bring happiness to future generations.

I wish the conference success.
I wish all committee members good health.

### 心花怒放  张有谷委员的发言

    心花怒放
    张有谷委员的发言各位代表：
    周总理的报告，总结了第一个五年计划时期和一九五八年的伟大成就。提出了一九五九年的全民的任务，指示了完成任务的办法。并分析了国际国内形势，指出了有利条件。使我们对祖国伟大的前途和美好的远景，进一步增强了信心，鼓舞了六亿几千万人民的情绪和干劲，大大加强了全国各民族和各阶层人民的亲密团结。这个报告，其影响之大，不仅普及全国，还将普及于全世界。
    我谨将个人意见发表于下。
    一九五八年是一个不平凡的一年，是全国全面大跃进的一年。祖国人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，以排山倒海的英雄气概，创造了史无前例震动全世界的工农业增产奇迹。钢铁翻一番，粮棉大丰收，煤产量一跃而超过老牌资本主义的英国。
    在大跃进中，一种新的社会组织——人民公社像太阳一样普照了全国。这个组织仅在短短的几个月时间里，就已经在各方面显示出它的无比优越性和强大生命力。
    其他文教、卫生、交通、运输、商业、国防各战线上都取得了极大的成绩。真是全国皆然，无一例外。
    就我住在的目前还不到三十万人口的牡丹江市来说：一九五八年工业产值比一九五七年增长百分之九十一，粮食增产百分之八十五点七，蔬菜增产百分之二百一十一。新建工厂二百八十五个。扫除了青壮年文盲，普及了小学、初中教育，除四害讲卫生基本上达到四无城市。特别是在短短的几个月中从手无寸铁而建成土洋高炉一百一十五座，转炉十五座，电炉一座，生产铁六千五百三十八吨，生产钢三千五百五十吨。
    一九五九年牡丹江市工业还要比一九五八年增百分之六十八点四，钢增产百分之六十九，铁增产百分之六百六十四点八。一九五九年还要炼铝，还要新建大中小型工厂一百二十三个。粮要增产百分之四十六，蔬菜要增产百分之一百二十。就这个城市来说，这是一个多么令人兴奋的数字。
    再就我工作的航校来说，我们的训练期限缩短了三分之一，而毕业人数则翻了一番；飞行时间翻了两番，质量更有很大的跃进。全国各地的这些跃进成绩，是整风和反右派的收获，是全国人民苦干的结果。归根到底，还是由于党和毛主席的领导。党中央和毛主席不仅领导中国人民站起来，还领导我们全国人民继续努力逐步地把我国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代化工业，现代化农业和现代化科学文化的社会主义国家。
    建国十年来所有各方面的进步和大跃进的情况，对我这个曾经在旧社会生活了四十多年，对国家民族曾失去信心，只知埋怨国民党贪污腐化，找不到一条正确光明的道路而曾窝窝囊囊、胡里胡涂地混日子的旧军人来说，特别敏感，特别兴奋。现在是走到哪里都是宏伟的建设，看到哪里都是飞腾的跃进。伟大的理想，美好的远景，真令我心花怒放，干劲冲天。
    建国十周年纪念的一九五九年是我们苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，由于党中央和毛主席的正确而英明的领导，由于全国六亿几千万人民的鼓足干劲，在今年我们的祖国将更加飞跃发展。在社会主义建设事业上将会创造出更多奇迹，取得更辉煌的成就，获得更大的跃进。
    关于原西藏地方政府一小撮上层反动分子叛变问题，我完全拥护周总理在报告中所提出的平息西藏叛乱的措施。我完全相信英勇的中国人民解放军在西藏爱国人民的密切配合之下，一定很快就彻底肃清残余流窜的叛乱分子。
    这一小撮反动分子叛变祖国，奸淫掳掠烧杀，企图扭转历史车轮，永远保持对西藏人民的封建农奴制度的残酷剥削。这种滔天罪行，凡是一个中国人民都是绝对不能容忍的。
    诚如毛主席所教导我们的辩证看问题的方法，坏事也可变成好事。这次原西藏地方政府一小撮上层分子的叛变，首先它教育了西藏一百多万人民。他们受到了一次深刻而实际的教育。他们将更善于明辨是非，将更善于分清敌我，将更快实行民族区域自治，将一步登天地由封建农奴制度跨进社会主义社会，将更快更早地与全国各族人民一道同享共产党和毛主席所领导所组织的繁荣幸福的社会主义的美好生活。
    另一方面，这一小撮反动分子的叛变，又给我们全国人民当了一次反面教员。我们因此更进一步深刻认识到帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮时时刻刻忘不了破坏我们伟大的祖国社会主义建设。我们要永远和经常地提高警惕，时刻防止并坚决粉碎阶级敌人的破坏。时刻准备着为解放祖国的领土台湾而努力奋斗。
    我个人还表示要进一步从政治和思想上加强自我改造，绝对服从党的领导，永远听党的话。还要开动脑筋运用双手同全国人民一道为建设我们的社会主义的，繁荣富强的，子孙万代幸福的祖国而努力奋斗。
    祝大会成功
    祝全体委员健康
