    Drummer
    Ye Fangsheng
    Lei Yi is a famous drummer in the Third Mining Area and also an excellent coal shoveler. When he shovels coal, he rolls up his sleeves to the root of his arms, and can scoop a thousand or eight hundred shovels in one breath, so everyone gave him the nickname "Quick Tempo."

    It's almost the end of the month. Before Quick Tempo took his miner's lamp and prepared to go down the well, he went to the dispatch room to inquire about the production situation. The dispatcher said to him: "Quick Tempo, if you create another high-yield day of seven thousand tons, you can carry the drum out to report the good news to the Party committee." He nodded and walked away satisfied.

    Just as he stepped out of the door, a burst of gongs and drums came from outside the east gate. Quick Tempo pricked up his ears and listened carefully, thinking, "This is the 'Rising Peaks' drumbeat played by Little Zhou, the drummer of the First Mining Area. I taught him this drumbeat." He felt both happy and excited, and squeezed into the crowd in one stride. The reporting team from the First Mining Area surged forward like a spring tide. The crowd shouted, "Look, the First Mining Area has created a record of seven thousand three hundred tons!"

    Quick Tempo also clapped his hands a few times, feeling both happy and uneasy. Little Zhou saw Quick Tempo from the crowd, beat the drum thunderously, and shouted towards Quick Tempo with his bright voice: "Hey, when are you going to carry the drum out?" Quick Tempo waved his hand and said, "Soon!" After speaking, he turned around and squeezed out of the crowd.

    His heart was pounding, his face was burning hot, and Little Zhou's drumbeat was like a beat on his heart. Suddenly, the coal cutting machine operator Little Jin rushed in, saw him sitting blankly facing the wall, ran over and said anxiously: "Hey, the First Mining Area has produced seven thousand three, what do we do?" Quick Tempo said: "There is only one way – chase!" How to chase? "Hard work plus ingenuity!"

    He looked at the clock on the wall, it was still early before the time to go down the pit, so he ran to the Party Secretary's office. As soon as he entered the room, the Secretary was already surrounded by workers from the Third Mining Area, all talking at once: "Secretary, we have soaring enthusiasm, we are determined to keep the red flag!" The Secretary smiled from ear to ear, encouraging everyone to go all out, think of more ways, and pay attention to safety. Seeing this situation, Quick Tempo didn't utter the words in his heart, jumped up three feet high with joy, and hurried to go down the pit. Suddenly a hand grabbed him, and when he looked back, it was Little Zhou from the First Mining Area. Quick Tempo asked him: "Why did you come here?" Little Zhou said with a grin: "I'm back from reporting the good news. I'm off today, and I'm here to talk to you about something." Quick Tempo waved his hand and said: "I'm busy today, let's talk another day!" As he was about to leave, Little Zhou said: "Okay, I won't rest either, let's go down the pit and talk."

    At the coal face, Little Zhou said to Quick Tempo: "I've figured out an experience, shoveling coal down the slope is less strenuous, and the efficiency can be doubled. If you don't believe me, let's try it." The two people talked more and more intimately, and worked harder and harder. They worked for eight hours in one go, and sure enough, the coal output doubled. As soon as he ascended from the pit, Quick Tempo went to the Secretary's office to inquire about the results. The Secretary had just ascended from the Third Mining Area and was changing his clothes. When he saw Quick Tempo, the first thing he said was: "Old Lei, quickly carry out your drum." By this time, a large crowd of people had gathered at the door, all to inquire about the new record of the Third Mining Area.

    After carrying out the drum, Quick Tempo said to Little Zhou: "You beat it." Little Zhou said: "You beat it." The Secretary said with a smile: "I think you two should beat it together." Four nimble hands beat the drum like spring thunder. People carried the happy sign of a high yield of eight thousand one hundred tons and went to report the good news to the Bureau Party Committee.

    鼓手

    雷义是三采区有名的鼓手，也是出色的撩煤工。他撩起煤来，把袖子往胳臂根儿一卷，一口气能攉个千儿八百下，所以大伙给他送了个外号叫“急点子”。
    眼看快到月底啦。急点子领了盏矿灯准备下井以前，先到调度室去打听一下生产情况。调度员对他说：“急点子，再创个七千吨高产日，就能把鼓抬出来向党委报喜去。”他点点头满意地走了。
    刚迈出门，只听得东门外传来一阵锣鼓声。急点子竖起耳朵仔细一听，心想：“这是一采区鼓手小周敲的‘节节峰’呀。这个鼓点还是我教的呢。”心头又欢慰，又激动，一个箭步挤进了人群。一采区的报喜队像春潮一样翻腾而来。人群里早喊了起来：“看哪，一采区创造七千三百吨记录啦！”
    急点子也拍了几声巴掌，心里又高兴、又不安。小周从人群里瞧见急点子，把鼓擂得震天动地，敞开那亮嗓子朝急点子喊：“喂，你们啥时候把鼓抬出来？”急点子挥挥手说：“快啦！”说完一扭身挤出人群。
    他的心砰砰地跳，脸一阵阵发烧，小周的鼓点像一下一下地打在他心坎上。突然截煤机手小金冲进门来，见他脸朝墙呆呆地坐着，跑过去焦急地说：“喂，一采区搞了七千三，咱怎么办？”急点子说：“办法只有一条——追！”怎么追法？“苦干加巧干呀！”
    他看看墙上的钟，离入坑时间还早，就往党委书记室跑去，一进屋，书记已被三采区的工人包围住了，七嘴八舌地在说：“书记，咱们有冲天的干劲，坚决保住红旗！”书记笑得合不拢嘴，鼓励大家要鼓足干劲，多想办法和注意安全。看到这情形，急点子满肚子的话没往外掏，乐得蹦起三尺高，急急忙忙就要下坑。忽然一只手拉住了他，回头一看，是一采区小周。急点子问他：“你怎么到这儿来？”小周笑嘻嘻地说：“报喜回来了，今日我歇班，来找你谈个事。”急点子忙摆手说：“今天忙着哩，改天再谈吧！”说着又要走，小周说：“那好，我也不休息了，咱们下坑再说。”
    到煤头上，小周对急点子说：“我摸着个经验啦，顺坡撩煤可省劲哩，效率可以提高一倍，不信咱俩试试。”两个人越说越贴心，越干越起劲，一气干了八小时，果然煤多出了一倍。一升坑，急点子就到书记室来打听战果。书记也才从三采区上坑，正在换衣裳，见了急点子劈头第一句话：“老雷，快把你们的鼓抬出来。”这时门口已经挤了一大群人，都来打听三采区的新纪录。
    抬出鼓，急点子对小周说：“你敲。”小周说：“还是你敲。”书记笑着说：“我看你们两个人一起敲吧。”四只灵巧的手，把鼓擂得像春雷一般，人们抬着高产八千一百吨的喜牌，向局党委报喜去了。
