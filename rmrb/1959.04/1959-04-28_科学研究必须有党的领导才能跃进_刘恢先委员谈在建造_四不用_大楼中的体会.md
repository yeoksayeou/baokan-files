I completely agree with and warmly endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1959 national economic plan, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 final accounts and the 1959 budget.

1958 was a year of great victories in China's socialist construction. Not only did the growth rate of our industrial and agricultural production shock the world, but our labor practices also overturned various outdated concepts and theories that constrained the productive forces, creating miracles and finding a broad road for building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. On the scientific front, we also had leaps in development and revolutionary creations; research results since the Great Leap Forward last year surpassed the work of the past few years. Why have we been able to achieve such great results in less than a year? In the final analysis, this is due to the establishment of the Party's absolute leadership over scientific undertakings and the implementation of the mass line as a working method. Now I will talk about some personal experiences.

I work at the Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Harbin. Last year, I participated in the scientific research work for the "Four No's" building in Harbin. The so-called "Four No's" means not using the four major building materials: steel, cement, wood, and red brick. The specific method is to use glass fiber as a substitute for steel bars; to use ceramic and glass plumbing materials as substitutes for steel plumbing materials; to use silicate materials as substitutes for red brick and concrete; and to use wood chip magnesite as a substitute for wood. This building was built under the initiative and leadership of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, through the joint collaboration of design and construction units, scientific research institutions, and material production departments. Following this building, a "Four No's" auditorium was also built in Beijing.

These two buildings mark a new direction in China's construction industry. The Party has pointed out this direction for us, and this direction is entirely in line with the requirements of the General Line. The spirit of the General Line is more, faster, better, and more economical. Where is the key to more, faster, better, and more economical basic construction? It can be said that it lies in materials, because materials account for a large part of the construction cost. Under the current situation of the rapid development of basic construction, traditional four major building materials are becoming increasingly tight; to develop the construction industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, we must break through this material limitation. We have been looking for topics year after year but haven't grasped this key point; it was the Party that pointed it out for us after all. What moved us particularly was that this work received the attention and care of many leading comrades from the province, the city, and the central government during the process, who personally inspected the construction site. After the building was completed, the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a national on-site meeting in Harbin to summarize the experience of the "Four No's" building. The meeting believed that the direction marked by this building was correct; it was believed that if it could be promoted and applied, it could save the country a lot of valuable materials, especially steel, which is of great significance to the national economy. At the same time, the meeting pointed out that we have not yet fully understood the properties of these materials, especially their durability; the production technology is still very backward; and the cost is still too high; we must continue to study these aspects. After the meeting, in accordance with the spirit of the meeting, we continued to promote and apply in a positive and pragmatic manner; at the same time, we organized a large-scale collaboration on research work and carried out further research, listing it as one of the main research directions of our institute. But looking back, we scientific researchers initially had a vague understanding of the significance of this work. In the early stage, we failed to implement the intentions of the Municipal Party Committee effectively; later, under the supervision and inspection of the Party, we truly valued it. Even after the building was completed, many of our comrades still underestimated it, unable to see the possibility of rapid promotion. This fact shows that only the far-sighted Party can point out the correct direction; especially when things are in their infancy, without the guidance of the Party, we often fail to see them. If there are still people who think that the Party is keen on politics and the technical personnel are keen on technology, the "Four No's" building shows that the Party is equally keen on technology.

The Party not only pointed out the direction for us, but also led us to fight against backward ideas. New things always encounter various ideological obstacles, first of all, the obstacle of conservative thinking. Conservative thinking believes that a new material must undergo long-term testing and verification before it can be practically applied; it doubts whether it is possible to complete the necessary experiments in a short period of time, and even more doubts whether it is feasible to research and apply at the same time. Conservative thinking manifests itself as not daring to start, and wanting to give up when encountering difficulties after starting. Whenever this kind of thinking grows, the Party timely helps us clarify our thinking, strengthen our confidence, overcome our wavering emotions, and encourage our fighting spirit. Because of the Party's leadership, we were able to persist in this work until the final victory.

The Party also educated us on the working methods of the mass line. The "Four No's" building was started under the direct leadership of the Party, mobilizing the masses in a vigorous manner. In the city, a joint operation from scientific research, material production to design, and construction was organized; within our institute, all employees were mobilized to participate in this work. Cooks and nursery workers were also busy with this, and the families of employees also participated in the production of glass fiber. However, some researchers, including myself, often did not trust the masses; whenever something happened, they wanted to be sure of themselves before feeling confident. When encountering difficulties, they often thought of solutions alone or with a few people, and were not good at giving play to the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses. The Party educated us to hand over tasks to the masses, trust the masses, and give play to the wisdom of the masses to solve problems. In fact, many of our problems were solved in this way.

The successful construction of the "Four No's" building, in addition to its own significance, played a huge role in promoting the work of our entire institute. First of all, it helped us break superstitions and liberate our minds. In the past, there were many superstitions in the institute, such as the superstition that civil engineering and architecture are old disciplines and it is difficult to have any creations; the superstition that research work must be done by senior personnel and must take years to obtain major results. These superstitions have all been bankrupt. The vivid facts have also made us realize the greatness of the wisdom and strength of the masses; to realize that it is not only possible but also necessary to carry out scientific research work in the manner of mass movements. Through this work, we also have a deeper understanding of the policy of "using tasks to drive disciplines." The research of the "Four No's" building has provided us with a broad scientific field; making us firmly believe that in China's technical revolution movement, technical problems in production will emerge endlessly, as long as we closely connect with production and serve production, scientific undertakings will develop vigorously.

In short, since the Great Leap Forward, our institute has been undergoing profound changes in both ideology and work. This change, in a nutshell, is that under the leadership of the Party, we are gradually clearing away the ideas and viewpoints of the bourgeoisie, breaking the working methods of the bourgeoisie, and truly embarking on the socialist road in scientific research work, establishing socialist working methods. The research of the "Four No's" building is a clear example. The facts have educated us, making us firmly believe that scientific research must leap forward under the absolute leadership of the Party; and making us have a hundredfold confidence in achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, and in making the greatest contribution in the upcoming national production-saving movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution.

    科学研究必须有党的领导才能跃进
    刘恢先委员谈在建造“四不用”大楼中的体会
    我完全同意并且热烈拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李维汉副主席的政协全国委员会常委会工作报告、李富春副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划的报告和李先念副总理的关于一九五八年决算和一九五九年预算的报告。
    一九五八年是我国社会主义建设获得伟大胜利的一年。非但我们的工农业生产的增长速度震惊了全世界，而且我们的劳动实践推翻了种种束缚生产力的陈旧观念和学说，创造了奇迹，找到了一条多快好省地建设社会主义的康庄大道。在科学阵线上，我们同样有飞跃的发展和革命性的创造；去年大跃进以来的研究成果胜过了过去几年的工作。为什么我们能在不到一年的时间获得这样大的成绩呢？归根结底，这是由于确立了党对科学事业的绝对领导和贯彻了群众路线的工作方法。现在我谈一点亲身的体验。
    我是在哈尔滨中国科学院土木建筑研究所工作，去年参加了哈尔滨创建的“四不用”大楼的科学研究工作。所谓“四不用”就是不用钢筋、水泥、木材、红砖四大建筑材料。具体办法是用玻璃丝筋代替钢筋；用陶瓷和玻璃的水暖材料代替钢铁的水暖材料；用矽酸盐材料代替红砖和混凝土；用木屑菱苦土代替木材。这座大楼是在哈尔滨中共市委的倡议和领导之下，由设计、施工单位，科学研究机构和材料生产部门共同协作建成的。继这座大楼之后又在北京建成一座“四不用”礼堂。
    这两座建筑标志着我国建筑事业上的一个新的方向，党给我们指出了这个方向，这个方向是完全合乎总路线的要求的。总路线的精神是多、快、好、省，基本建设要多、快、好、省，关键主要在哪儿呢？可以说在于材料，因为材料占了建筑造价的大部分。在当前基本建设飞跃发展的形势下，传统的四大建筑材料日益显得紧张；要多、快、好、省地发展建筑事业就必须突破这个材料上的限制。我们年年找题目，没有抓住这个关键，毕竟党给我们指出来了。使我们特别感动的是，这项工作在进行过程之中受到了省、市、和中央许多领导同志的重视与关怀，亲自到工地视察。在大楼建成之后，建筑工程部和中国科学院又在哈尔滨召开了全国性的现场会议，总结“四不用”大楼的经验。会议认为这座大楼所标志的方向是正确的；认为如果能够推广应用，就可以为国家节约大量的贵重的材料，特别是钢材，这对于国民经济具有很大意义。会议同时指出，我们对这些材料的性能，特别是它的耐久性还没有摸清楚；生产工艺还很落后；造价还嫌高；必须从这些方面继续研究。在会后，我们按照会议的精神，一面采取积极而又实事求是的态度继续推广应用；一面组织研究工作上的大协作，开展进一步的研究，把它列为我们研究所的主要研究方向之一。但是回想起来，我们搞科学研究的人当初对于这项工作的意义却是认识不清的。在初期贯彻市委的意图不力；后来在党的督促检查之下，才真正地重视起来。在大楼建成之后，我们还有不少同志对它估价不足，看不出有很快推广的可能。这个事实说明正确的方向只有高瞻远瞩的党才能指出来；特别在事物萌芽的时候，没有党的指点，我们往往视而不见。如果还有人认为政治上是党敏锐，技术上是技术人员敏锐的话，“四不用”大楼说明技术上同样是党敏锐。
    党不仅给我们指明了方向，还领导了我们和落后思想作斗争。新鲜的事情总会遇到种种思想障碍，首先是保守思想的障碍。保守思想认为一种新材料必须经过长期间的试验和考验才能实际应用；怀疑是否可能在短期间完成必要的实验，更怀疑边研究，边应用是否行得通。保守思想表现为不敢上马，上了马遇着困难就想下马。每逢这种思想滋长的时候，党就及时帮助我们澄清思想、坚定信心、克服摇摆情绪，鼓舞我们的斗志。由于党这样领导，我们才能坚持这项工作到最后胜利。
    党又教育了我们走群众路线的工作方法。“四不用”大楼是在党的直接领导下，发动群众轰轰烈烈地搞起来的。在市内，组织了从科学研究、材料生产到设计、施工的联合作业；在我们研究所内，发动了全体职工来参加这个工作。炊事员、保育员都为此忙起来，职工家属也参加玻璃丝筋的生产。但是有些研究人员，包括我自己，往往不相信群众；遇事都要自己心里有底才觉得有把握。遇着困难，常常单独想办法或者找少数人想办法，不善于发挥群众的智慧和积极性。党教育我们把任务交给群众，相信群众，发挥群众的智慧来解决。事实上我们有许多问题就是这样解决的。
    “四不用”大楼的建造成功除了它本身的意义以外，对我们整个研究所的工作起了巨大的促进作用。首先，帮助了我们破除迷信，解放思想。以往所内有不少迷信，譬如迷信土木建筑是老学科，很难有什么创造；迷信研究工作必须由高级人员来做，必须穷年累月才能得到重大的成果。这些迷信都一一破产了。活生生的事实又使我们认识到群众的智慧和力量的伟大；认识到以群众运动的方式进行科学研究工作非但可能而且很必要。通过这项工作，我们对于“以任务带学科”的方针也有比较深刻的理解。“四不用”大楼的研究给我们提供了一个广阔的科学领域；使我们深信在我国大闹技术革命的运动中，生产上的技术问题会层出不穷，只要紧密地联系生产、为生产服务，科学事业就会蓬勃地发展起来。
    总之，自大跃进以来，我们研究所从思想到工作都在起着深刻的变化。这个变化，概括地说，就是在党的领导下，逐步清除资产阶级的思想和观点，打破资产阶级的工作方式和方法，使科学研究工作真正走上社会主义道路，建立起社会主义的工作方式和方法。“四不用”大楼的研究是一个明显的实例。事实教育了我们，使我们深信，科学研究必须在党的绝对领导之下才能够跃进；并使我们有百倍信心在一九五九年实现一个更大、更好、更全面的跃进，在即将到来的、全民性的、以技术革新与技术革命为中心的生产节约运动中，作出最大的贡献。
