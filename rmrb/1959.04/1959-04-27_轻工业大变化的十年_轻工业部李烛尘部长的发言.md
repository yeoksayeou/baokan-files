Chairman, fellow delegates:
I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1958 National Financial Statement and the Draft National Budget for 1959"; and will strive to implement the principles and tasks outlined in these reports.

First, on behalf of the staff and workers of the Ministry of Light Industry, I would like to express my views on the Tibetan rebellion. The armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper class has suffered a shameful defeat. The Tibetan people now have the opportunity to break free from the shackles of serfdom and realize their aspirations for democratic autonomy and social progress. This small group of reactionaries, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, attempted to create a division of the motherland and preserve the backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system. However, the result was the opposite of their intentions, promoting the unification and consolidation of the motherland and the rebirth of the Tibetan people. The reactionary elements' treasonous actions seriously violated the interests of the Tibetan people and the common interests of all ethnic groups in the country. Their criminal faces of betraying the motherland, violating the Seventeen-Article Agreement, harming the people, and destroying religion have been fully exposed before the people of the whole country, especially before the Tibetan people, and thus have been resolutely opposed by the people of all ethnic groups, especially by the broad masses of Tibetan people, and spurned. The State Council's order of March 28 regarding the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and the dissolution of the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion fully expresses the will of the people of the whole country, especially the will of the clergy and laity of Tibet. The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" is even more a lie-filled and extremely clumsy suspicious document. It even attempts to distort the historical fact that Tibet is Chinese territory, further exposing the crime of reactionary elements colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to kidnap the Dalai Lama and undermine the unity of the motherland. Tibet is a part of Chinese territory, and we feel extremely indignant that this so-called statement was issued in India, a country pursuing peaceful coexistence and friendly relations, and distributed by officials of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

I fully support the guidelines for handling the Tibet issue in Premier Zhou's report. I fully believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the help of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and through the efforts of the Tibetan people, we will surely be able to build the Tibetan plateau into a true paradise on earth.

Next, I will talk about some issues in light industry (excluding the textile industry). Please correct any inaccuracies.

Light industry is an important part of the national economy and is indispensable to the daily lives of millions of people. Moreover, it reflects the living standards of the vast people of a country. An important sign of improved living standards is, first of all, the demand to be well-fed, and then to have a rich and varied, colorful and delicious diet. At the same time, it also requires the supply of more practical, convenient, comfortable, and economical daily necessities and various cultural and recreational products. Among the thousands of daily necessities, even a very small product, such as a bar of soap, a box of matches, a bowl, a hairpin, a pair of shoes, etc., is not only indispensable, but also requires high quality and large quantity.

Light industry not only produces consumer goods, but also produces some means of production to meet the needs of heavy industry, national defense industry, and agriculture. Such as various industrial technical papers, industrial leather products, industrial enamel, ceramics, glass products, alcohol, glycerin, furfural, salt, seedling paper, potassium-magnesium fertilizer, etc., which play a certain role in supporting the development of other sectors of the national economy.

The development of light industry depends on the development of agriculture and heavy industry, on the one hand, and promotes the development of agriculture and heavy industry, on the other hand. At the same time, it also contributes to the development of foreign trade and accumulates construction funds for the country.

Light industry should play the above-mentioned roles in the national economy, and it is already playing these roles.

The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have always paid close attention to the close combination of production and life, and have paid great attention to the development of handicrafts and light industry in our country. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, the policy of "developing production and ensuring supply" was formulated. In 1957, in his famous report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao instructed that the road to industrialization in our country must focus on the development of heavy industry, while fully paying attention to the development of agriculture and light industry. In 1958, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In the same year, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party comprehensively summarized the past construction experience. It further affirmed a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies, such as giving priority to the development of heavy industry, while simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously developing foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production. Therefore, light industry, like other sectors of the national economy, has greatly developed and undergone fundamental changes compared with before liberation.

In recent years, in addition to tapping the potential of existing enterprises, the state has continuously built and expanded many enterprises, which has greatly developed the production of light industry. For example, machine-made paper. From the establishment of the first machine-made paper mill by Li Hongzhang in Shanghai in 1891 to 1949, it experienced 58 years of long years. During this period, the highest annual output was only 165,000 tons. In 1957, the production of machine-made paper reached 913,000 tons, an increase of 748,000 tons compared with the highest annual output before liberation. The development in eight years is equivalent to more than five times the development in 58 years before liberation. In 1958, 1.22 million tons were produced, an increase of more than 300,000 tons compared with 1957. The increase in this year exceeded twice the development in 58 years before liberation. In 1957, 8,277,000 tons of crude salt were produced, an increase of 5,387,000 tons compared with 1949, exceeding the historical highest level before liberation by more than one time. In 1958, it increased by 2.12 million tons compared with 1957. The output of sugar in 1957 exceeded the historical highest level before liberation by more than one time. In 1957, 130 million pairs of rubber shoes were produced, exceeding the historical highest level before liberation by more than one time. In 1958, it increased by more than 50 million pairs, reaching 180 million pairs. Other products such as edible vegetable oil, bicycles, sewing machines, clocks, etc. have also greatly increased. Light industry has not only greatly developed in terms of capital construction scale and production, but also made great progress in production technology. In old China, many products could not be designed and manufactured at all. Now we have established many brand-new industrial sectors and produced thousands of products that have never been produced in our country. These include various industrial technical papers urgently needed for national construction (6-7 micron capacitor paper, high-voltage cable paper, etc.), rayon pulp, various ceramic machinery, chemical enamel equipment, optical glass, quartz glass, glass fiber, tempered glass, cameras, film, watches, artificial leather, rectified alcohol, high-grade glycerin, various fragrances, various types of canned food, etc. Many light industrial products that could not be manufactured in our country in the past can now be manufactured. In the past, we relied on imports, but now we no longer rely on imports. On the contrary, we also have a certain amount of exports.

During the first five-year plan period, the output value of light industry doubled, with an average annual increase of about 17 percent. On this basis, light industry achieved a great leap forward in 1958. This was an extraordinary year. According to the calculation of the output value of 41 major products, the output value increased by 40 percent. In this year, the great leap forward in agriculture provided abundant resources and a broad market for light industry and the food industry. The "Marshal ascends the platform" of steel also drove the great leap forward in light industry. Under the leadership of the party and government at all levels, the vast number of employees in the light industry department earnestly implemented the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, earnestly implemented the "walking on two legs" policy of five simultaneous developments, both giving way and leaping forward, fully mobilizing the masses, relying on self-reliance, and vigorously carrying out technical revolution, thus achieving unprecedented development.

The technical revolution and technical innovation in light industry in 1958 were very prominent. This is first manifested in improving tools and equipment, realizing mechanized production, and improving production efficiency. In the paper-making, salt-making, ceramics, glass, and enamel industries alone, there were more than 700 major innovation projects in tools, equipment, and technology. It has played a great role in improving production, saving labor, and completing plans. In the past year, the paper industry has created more than 100 advanced technical experiences. There have been major innovations in the entire process from raw material preparation, cooking, pulping, paper making to finished product packaging, which can increase production efficiency by 20% to 50% or more. For example, the cooking time of reed pulp in Tianjin Paper Mill used to take 13 hours per pot during the Japanese and puppet period, but was shortened to more than 2 hours in 1958. The salt-making industry has implemented measures such as extracting brine under ice and advancing spring drying, changing seasonal production to year-round production and changing sideline production to factory production.

Second, in terms of self-reliance, saving steel materials, and solving equipment difficulties, the workers and masses have also created many methods. The most prominent is "replacing steel with ceramics." According to statistics from 14 provinces (cities), in 1958, the production of more than 80 kinds of ceramic industrial equipment such as alcohol distillation towers, blowers, water pumps, acid-resistant pumps, and sulfuric acid towers saved the country 70,000 tons of steel. It not only solved the equipment difficulties of many light industries in the leap forward, but also greatly supported the development of other industries.

Third, in terms of raw material saving and substitution, many industries have created many good methods for saving and substituting raw materials. For example, in addition to promoting the use of grass fiber for pulping, the paper industry has also paid attention to adopting measures such as waste liquid recovery and two-stage cooking to save caustic soda consumption. The leather industry actively promoted the use of pigskin for leather making. Daily metal products have improved product design and greatly saved steel consumption. The use of sponge soles, carbon black soles, and microporous soles for rubber shoes has saved enough raw rubber for the country to produce more than 10 million pairs of rubber shoes.

These achievements are the result of the broad masses of workers responding to the call of the Party and carrying out the technical revolution and cultural revolution movement, and the result of the rectification movement and the general line education.

The leap forward in light industry in 1958 was not only due to the technical revolution in existing enterprises, but also to the "small indigenous groups"—the people's communes vigorously running industries. This was another important aspect of the leap forward in light industry last year. As everyone knows, 60% to 70% of the raw materials of light industry come from rural areas, and most of the products are sold in rural areas. Agriculture and light industry have extremely close relations. According to the pilot projects of the light industry departments helping the people's communes to vigorously run industries in 12 counties in 10 provinces last winter and this spring, it has been proved that: According to the actual possibilities in various places, the people's communes rationally running agricultural product processing industries and some light industries can timely process urgently needed agricultural and sideline products, can reduce the burden of urban light industries supplying the needs of rural areas, and make the layout of light industries gradually more reasonable; and greatly liberate rural labor, especially women's labor; it is conducive to the further consolidation and development of the communes; and because the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods is adopted, it can also achieve the advantages of less investment, less materials, and quick results.

The scale and speed of capital construction in light industry in 1958 were also unprecedented. In this year, the paper industry added a production capacity of more than 300,000 tons due to capital construction, and the sugar industry also increased a production capacity of 600,000 tons (including indigenous sugar). The construction in one year was close to or exceeded the total of the previous five years.

Simultaneous with the leap forward in production and construction, the political ideology, socialist and communist awareness of the broad masses of workers have rapidly improved. Due to the implementation of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," the relationship between leaders and the masses has been greatly improved, and unity has been strengthened. These have strongly promoted the development of production.

Due to the development of the national economy in recent years, especially the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, the living standards of the working people have been greatly improved, and the demand for light industrial products has greatly increased. According to the data of the State Statistical Bureau, the national retail sales of several major consumer goods in 1958 increased significantly compared with the previous year. Machine-made paper increased by 55%, rubber shoes increased by 52%, and thermos bottles increased by 29%. According to our survey materials in 9 counties in 9 provinces, such as Suqian in Jiangsu, Linquan in Anhui, and Sui County in Henan, the consumption volume in rural areas in 1958 increased even more sharply. Compared with the previous year, rubber shoes increased by 115%, machine-made paper increased by 93.7%, enamel basins increased by 79.7%, enamel mugs increased by 61.5%, and soap increased by 8.8%. In the past, gold pens, fountain pens, and clocks were only enjoyed by a few wealthy people, but now they have become daily necessities for the broad masses. Thermos bottles have also become a must-have item for every household. In the past, people's clothing in rural areas completely relied on women to sew stitch by stitch, but now many villages have used sewing machines to replace manual labor. In 1958, more than 630,000 sewing machines were produced, an increase of more than one time compared with the previous year. This not only reduces women's housework, but more importantly, it liberates women's labor force from housework. In short, in the past, only industrial products for daily use were supplied to cities, but now they are also supplied to rural areas in large quantities; in the past, only a few people could enjoy them, but now the broad masses can enjoy them; in the past, noble products that only wealthy people could afford have now become necessities that the majority of people can afford. The miserable life of the working people before liberation, "half a year of bran and vegetables and half a year of grain," and "a dou of rice for a jin of salt" has gone forever.

As mentioned above, my country's light industry has made great progress in the past ten years, and people's lives have undergone significant changes, especially after the comprehensive leap forward in production and construction and the rural collectivization in 1958. In 1958, light industry, like other sectors of the national economy, achieved an unprecedented leap forward, but the needs for certain products were not met for a period of time. This poses a new topic for us, that is: light industry must continue to leap forward greatly in 1959, thereby further improving people's lives and enabling the people of our country to carry out construction with a happy mood and vigorous energy.

On the basis of the continued comprehensive leap forward in light industry and the increase in people's purchasing power, a huge leap forward must and can be made in 1959. The edible vegetable oil plan will reach 1.8 million tons, an increase of 44% compared with the previous year; sugar will reach 1.5 million tons, an increase of 67%; crude salt will reach 13 million tons, an increase of 25%; paper will reach 2.2 million tons, an increase of 35%; cigarettes will reach 5.1 million boxes, an increase of 7%; other food industries, daily chemical industries, daily hardware industries, etc. will also have great growth, such as watches, cameras, photographic film, alcohol, dairy products, handcart wheels, etc. will increase by one to several times. Fountain pens, pencils, thermos bottles, sewing machines, clocks, etc. will also increase by more than 40%. These planned targets are proposed by considering not only the objective possibility of my country's material and technical conditions, but also the subjective initiative of the revolutionary enthusiasm of all employees on the light industry front and the requirements for mutual adaptation of the entire national economy. The growth rate of these products is not only expressed in percentage, but also in absolute numbers. Many products have also increased significantly compared with the previous year. For example, the planned production of paper in 1959 is 2.2 million tons, an increase of 570,000 tons compared with 1958, while the increase in 1958 compared with 1957 was only 410,000 tons. The same is true for products such as salt, cigarettes, sugar, edible vegetable oil, etc. Therefore, the plan for light industry in 1959 is undoubtedly a continuation of the great leap forward in 1958 and a plan for high-speed development.

What is the basic method for completing the plan? Light industry already had a good experience in the great leap forward last year. This experience is: vigorously carry out mass movements under the leadership of the party and government at all levels, carry out technical revolution in existing enterprises, and run industries in the people's communes. This experience must continue to be adopted in 1959. At present, on the entire light industry front, a mass movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy and improving quality should be launched immediately, and the national planning tasks should be assigned to grass-roots production units, work sections, and groups. By means of large-scale airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates, the masses should be mobilized to come up with ideas together, find tricks, and tap potential to strive to complete the planning tasks.

1959 is the second year of the three years of hard work. We firmly believe that we will be able to strive to complete and overfulfill the national plan for 1959. Let all of our light industry employees greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day with practical actions of hard production and construction. Let us fight for the construction of our great socialist motherland!

    轻工业大变化的十年
    轻工业部李烛尘部长的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”；并将为这些报告中所提出的方针和任务的贯彻执行而努力。
    现在我先代表轻工业部职工同志们就西藏叛乱事件发表一点意见。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的武装叛乱，已经遭到了可耻的失败。西藏人民现在已经有可能摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，而实现民主自治和社会进步的愿望。这一小撮反动分子，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，妄想造成祖国的分裂和保存落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度，然而结果正和他们的打算相反，却促进了祖国的统一和巩固，促进了西藏人民的新生。反动分子的叛国行为，严重地违反了西藏人民的利益和国内各民族的共同利益。他们背叛祖国、破坏十七条协议、残害人民、摧残宗教的罪恶面目，已经在全国人民面前，首先在西藏人民面前暴露无遗，因而遭到了全国各民族人民的坚决反对，首先遭到了西藏广大人民的反对和唾弃。国务院三月二十八日关于平息西藏叛乱、解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的命令，正是充分表达了全国人民的意愿，特别是西藏僧俗人民的意愿。所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，更是一个谎话连篇、十分拙劣的可疑的文件。甚至连西藏是中国的领土这一历史事实也企图歪曲，更进一步暴露了反动分子勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和国外反动派劫持达赖喇嘛破坏祖国统一的罪行。西藏是中国领土的一部分，我们对这个所谓的声明，竟在奉行和平共处、友好的邻邦印度发表，并经由印度外交部的官员散发，感到无比的愤慨。
    周总理报告中关于处理西藏问题的方针，我完全拥护，我完全相信在中国共产党的领导下，在全国各族人民的帮助下，经过西藏人民的努力，一定可以把西藏高原建设成一个真正的人间乐园。
    其次讲讲轻工业方面（不包括纺织工业）的一些问题，不妥之处，请各位代表指正。
    轻工业是国民经济中的一个重要组成部分，是千百万人日常生活所离不了的。而且它体现一个国家广大人民生活的水平。人们生活改善的重要标志，首先是要求吃得饱，进而要求丰富多采，色鲜味美。同时，还要求供应更多的实用、方便、舒适、经济的日用品和各种文化娱乐用品，在成千上万的日用生活产品中，那怕是很细小的一个产品，如一块肥皂、一盒火柴、一个碗碟、一只发卡、一双鞋子等等，不但缺少了它们不行，而且还要求质高量多。
    轻工业不光是生产生活资料，而且还配合着重工业、国防工业和农业的需要生产一部分生产资料。如各种工业技术用纸、工业用皮革制品、工业用的搪瓷、陶瓷、玻璃制品、酒精、甘油、糠醛、盐、育苗纸、钾镁肥料等，对支援国民经济其他部门的发展，起着一定的作用。
    轻工业的发展，一方面有赖于农业和重工业的发展，另一方面它又促进了农业和重工业的发展，同时又有助于对外贸易的发展和为国家积累建设资金。
    轻工业在国民经济中要起到上述这些作用，而且已经在起着这些作用。
    中国共产党和毛主席历来就十分注意生产和生活的密切结合，十分注意我国手工业和轻工业的发展的，远在抗日战争时期就制订了“发展生产，保障供给”的政策；一九五七年毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的著名报告中，指示我国工业化的道路必须以发展重工业为中心的同时，充分注意农业和轻工业的发展；一九五八年，中共中央制定了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线；同年中国共产党八届六中全会全面地总结了过去的建设经验。进一步肯定了在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工业和农业同时并举，重工业和轻工业同时并举，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产与土法生产同时并举等一整套的“两条腿走路”的方针。因此轻工业象其他国民经济部门一样有了很大发展。和解放前比较，起了根本上的变化。
    几年来轻工业的发展，除发挥原有企业潜力外，国家不断新建和扩建了许多企业，使得轻工业的生产有了很大的发展。例如机制纸，从一八九一年李鸿章在上海创办的第一座机制纸厂开始，到一九四九年经历了五十八年漫长的岁月，在此期间最高年产量仅达十六万五千吨。一九五七年机制纸生产达到九十一万三千吨，比解放前最高年产量增长了七十四万八千吨，八年的发展相当于解放前五十八年发展的五倍多。一九五八年生产一百二十二万吨，比一九五七年增长三十多万吨，这一年的增长超过了解放前五十八年发展的两倍。原盐一九五七年生产八百二十七万七千吨，比一九四九年增长了五百三十八万七千吨，超过了解放前历史最高水平一倍多，一九五八年又比一九五七年增长了二百一十二万吨。糖的产量一九五七年超过了解放前历史最高水平一倍多。胶鞋一九五七年产一亿三千万双，超过解放前历史最高水平的一倍多，一九五八年又增长了五千多万双。达到一亿八千万双。其它如食用植物油、自行车、缝纫机、钟表等都有了很大的增长。轻工业不仅在基本建设规模上和生产上有很大发展，而且在生产技术方面也有很大进步。旧中国许多产品自己根本不能设计和制造。现在我们已经建立了许多崭新的工业部门，生产出那些为我国从来没有生产过的数以千计的产品。其中包括国家建设迫切需要的各种工业技术用纸（六、七微米电容器纸、高压电缆纸等）、人造丝浆、各种陶瓷机械、化工搪瓷设备、光学玻璃、石英玻璃、玻璃纤维、钢化玻璃、照相机、胶卷、胶片、手表、人造皮革、精馏酒精、高级甘油、各种香料、各种品种的罐头等等。有许多轻工产品过去我国不能制造的现在能够制造了，过去依靠进口的现在不靠进口了，相反地，还有一定数量的出口。
    轻工业在第一个五年计划期间，产值增长了一倍，平均每年增长百分之一十七左右。在此基础上一九五八年轻工业获得了一个大跃进，这是不寻常的一年。据四十一种主要产品计算产值增长了百分之四十。这一年农业的大跃进给轻工业、食品工业提供了丰富的资源和广阔的市场。钢铁“元帅升帐”又带动了轻工业的大跃进。轻工业部门的广大职工在各级党和政府的领导下，认真贯彻了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，认真贯彻了五个并举“两条腿走路”的方针，既让路，又跃进，充分发动群众，自力更生，大搞技术革命，因而获得了空前的发展。
    一九五八年轻工业的技术革命和技术革新是很突出的一年。这首先表现在改进工具设备，实现机械化生产，提高生产效率方面。仅造纸、制盐、陶瓷、玻璃、搪瓷五个行业，在工具、设备、工艺等方面的重大革新项目就有七百多项。对于提高生产，节约劳动力，完成计划起了很大作用。造纸工业在去年一年曾创造了一百多项先进的技术经验，从备料、蒸煮、打浆、抄纸到成品包装整个工艺过程都有重大革新，使生产效率可以提高百分之二十到百分之五十还多。如天津纸厂苇浆蒸煮时间，日伪时期每锅需十三小时，一九五八年缩短到二小时多。制盐工业实行冰下抽卤、提前春晒等措施，变季节性生产为常年生产，变副业性生产为工厂生产。
    第二，在自力更生，节约钢铁材料，解决设备困难方面，职工群众也创造出了许多办法，突出的是“以陶瓷代钢铁”，据十四个省（市）统计，一九五八年生产的酒精蒸馏塔、鼓风机水泵、耐酸泵、硫酸塔等八十多种陶瓷工业设备，为国家节省了七万吨钢铁，不仅解决不少轻工业在跃进中的设备的困难，而又大大地支持了其他工业的发展。
    第三，在原材料的节约和代用方面，许多行业都创造出不少节约代用解决原材料的好办法，如造纸工业除了推广草类纤维制浆而外，还注意了采取废液回收、两级蒸煮等措施以节约烧碱消耗。皮革工业积极地推行了猪皮制革。日用金属制品改进产品设计，大大节约了钢铁消耗。胶鞋采用海绵底、炭黑大底、微孔大底等方法，所节约的生胶就为国家多增产了胶鞋一千余万双。
    这些成就，是广大职工群众响应党的号召，开展技术革命和文化革命运动的结果。是整风运动和总路线教育的结果。
    一九五八年轻工业的跃进，不仅由于在现有企业中进行技术革命，同时也搞了“小土群”——在人民公社大办工业，这是去年轻工业取得跃进的另一个重要方面。大家知道，轻工业的原料百分之六、七十来自农村，而产品大部分销于农村，农业和轻工业有着极为密切的关系。根据去冬今春轻工业部门到十个省十二个县帮助人民公社大办工业的试点证明：根据各地的实际可能，人民公社合理地办农产品加工工业及一些轻工业，可以及时处理迫切需要加工的农副产品，可以减轻城市轻工业供应农村需要的负担，使轻工业的布局渐趋于合理；并大大解放了农村劳动力，特别是妇女的劳动力；有利于公社进一步巩固和发展；而且因为采取了土洋结合的办法，也可以收到投资少、用材少、收效快的好处。
    一九五八年轻工业的基本建设的规模和速度也是空前的，这一年造纸工业由于进行了基本建设而新增的生产能力就达到三十多万吨，制糖工业也增加了生产能力六十万吨（其中包括土糖），一年的建设就接近或超过了前五年的总和。
    在与生产建设跃进的同时，广大职工在政治思想上，社会主义和共产主义觉悟迅速提高。由于实行了“两参、一改、三结合”，领导与群众的关系大大改善了，团结加强了。这些，都有力地促进了生产的发展。
    由于几年来国民经济的发展，特别是一九五八年工农业的大跃进，就使得劳动人民的生活水平得到了较大的改善，对轻工业品的需要大大增长。据国家统计局的资料，几种主要消费品一九五八年全国的零售量都比上年有很大增长，机制纸增加了百分之五十五，胶鞋增加了百分之五十二，暖水瓶增加了百分之二十九。据我们在江苏宿迁、安徽临泉、河南遂平等九个省的九个县的调查材料表明，一九五八年农村的消费量增长更为猛烈，与上年比较，胶鞋增长了百分之一百一十五，机制纸增长了百分之九十三点七，搪瓷面盆增长了百分之七十九点七，搪瓷口杯增长了百分之六十一点五，肥皂增长了百分之八点八。过去，金笔、钢笔、钟表只是少数有钱的人才能享有的，现在也成为广大群众的生活必需品了，暖水瓶也成为每户人家的必备品。过去农村人们的衣着完全依靠妇女一针针来缝，现在已经有不少乡村使用缝纫机代替了手工，一九五八年生产缝纫机达六十三万多台，比上年增长了一倍多，这不仅减轻了妇女的家务劳动，更重要的是把妇女劳动力从家务劳动中解放出来。总之，过去只是供应城市的日用工业品，现在也大量地供应了农村；过去只是少数人才能享受的，现在广大群众都能享受了；过去只是有钱人才能买得起的高贵用品，现在却成为多数人能够买得起的必需用品。劳动人民解放前“半年糠菜半年粮”、“斗米斤盐”的悲惨生活已经一去不复返了。
    如上所述，十年来我国轻工业有了巨大的发展，人民生活有了显著的变化，特别是一九五八年生产建设全面大跃进和农村公社化以后更为显著。一九五八年轻工业与国民经济其它部门一样获得了空前的大跃进，但是某些产品在一个时期还满足不了需要。这给我们提出了一个新的课题，这就是：轻工业一九五九年必须继续大跃进，从而进一步改善人民生活，使我国人民心情舒畅，精力旺盛地进行建设。
    一九五九年轻工业在继续全面大跃进和人民购买力提高的基础上，必须而且可能来一个巨大的跃进。食用植物油计划将达到一百八十万吨，比上年增长百分之四十四；糖一百五十万吨，增长百分之六十七；原盐一千三百万吨，增长百分之二十五；纸二百二十万吨，增长百分之三十五；卷烟五百一十万箱，增长百分之七；其它各项食品工业、日用化学工业、日用五金工业等等，都有很大增长，如手表、照相机、照相胶卷、酒精、乳制品、手推车轮等都将增长一倍至几倍。钢笔、铅笔、暖水瓶、缝纫机、钟等也将增长百分之四十以上。这些计划指标，是既考虑了我国物质技术条件的客观可能性，也考虑了轻工业战线上的全体职工们革命干劲的主观能动性以及整个国民经济互相适应的要求而提出的，这些产品的增长速度不仅表现于百分比，而且在绝对数上许多产品也比上年有很大增长。如纸一九五九年计划生产二百二十万吨，比一九五八年将增长五十七万吨，而一九五八年比一九五七年增长不过四十一万吨，盐、卷烟、糖、食用植物油等等产品都是如此。因此一九五九年轻工业的计划，无疑地是一九五八年大跃进的继续，是一个高速度发展的计划。
    完成计划的基本方法是什么呢？去年轻工业大跃进中已经有了一条好经验，这条经验就是：在各级党和政府的领导下大搞群众运动，在现有企业开展技术革命和在人民公社举办工业。这条经验在一九五九年仍须继续采用。目前在整个轻工业战线上，应当立即展开一个以增产节约、提高质量为中心的群众运动，把国家计划任务下达到基层生产单位、工段、小组，通过大鸣大放大字报大辩论的方式，动员群众大家一道来出主意，找窍门，挖潜力，为完成计划任务而努力。
    一九五九年是苦战三年的第二年，我们坚信一定能够争取完成和超额完成一九五九年的国家计划，让我们全体轻工业职工以努力生产建设的实际行动来迎接国庆十周年，让我们为建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国而奋斗！
