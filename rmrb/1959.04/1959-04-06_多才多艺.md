    Versatile
    Lu Zhongxiang
    On the stage, people often see versatile actors. For example, Mr. Mei Lanfang in "Cosmic Front," playing the Tsing Yi role of Zhao Nu feigning madness and risking danger, scolding the King of Qin, was very moving; in "Farewell My Concubine," playing the Hua Dan role of Yu Ji dancing with swords, was also truly brilliant. Today playing Liang Hongyu, tomorrow playing Yang Guifei, this is Mr. Mei's versatility.
    The stage needs versatile actors. I think, in production practice, especially in the Great Leap Forward, there is even greater need for versatile people.
    On March 26th of this year, the People's Daily published a news item on the second page titled "Studying Diligently Produces Skilled Craftsmen, More Skills Mean Higher Efficiency," reporting that the Zhang Huaji group completed nine months' worth of work in two and a half months. Why was their labor efficiency so high? Because this Zhang Huaji group changed the past phenomenon of one person only being able to do one type of work. All the workers in the group generally mastered various techniques such as forging, riveting, shearing, punching, fitter work, and drilling. One person could operate several processes simultaneously. This is what it means to be versatile.
    In the Juren People's Commune of Bin County, Heilongjiang Province, there appeared a nineteen-year-old Korean "Iron Girl," Li Zhenfen. She knows artificial pollination, pesticide use, seed disinfection, and can also milk cows and drive tractors. When it's time for spring planting, she can sow seeds; when it's time for autumn harvest, she can harvest rice. She can pick things up and put them down, and is useful wherever she is needed. People first called Li Zhenfen "Iron Girl," and later called her "All-Purpose Girl." This is another type of versatile person.
    Building socialism should be like this. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, production is constantly developing, and technology is constantly innovating. This requires thousands upon thousands of versatile people like the Zhang Huaji group workers and Li Zhenfen.
    "Versatile" means hard work, studying diligently to become skilled craftsmen, and more skills mean higher efficiency. With more people like this, we can accelerate the pace of our socialist construction.

### 多才多艺

    多才多艺
  　陆忠祥
    在舞台上，人们常常看到多才多艺的演员。比如梅兰芳先生演“宇宙锋”，饰青衣赵女装疯弄险，怒骂秦王，十分动人；演“霸王别姬”，饰花旦虞姬舞剑，也着实精采。今日扮演梁红玉，明日又饰杨贵妃，这是梅先生之多才多艺。
    舞台上需要多才多艺的演员。我想，在生产实践上，特别是更大跃进中，就更需要多才多艺的人。
    在今年3月26日人民日报二版上，刊登了一条“钻研出巧匠，艺多效率高”的新闻，报道张化吉小组两个半月完成九个月工作量。为什么他们的劳动效率能这么高呢？因为这个张化吉小组改变了过去一个人只能做一种活的现象，全组工人普遍掌握了锻、铆、剪、冲、钳、钻等多种技术，一个人可以同时操纵几道工序，这就是多才多艺的人。
    黑龙江省宾县居仁人民公社，出现了一个十九岁的朝鲜族“铁姑娘”李真芬。她会人工授粉、农药使用、籽种消毒，也会给黄牛挤奶，开拖拉机。说春播就点种，说收秋就割稻，拿得起来，放得下去，哪用就哪到。人们先称李真芬为“铁姑娘”，后称“万能姑娘”。这又是一种多才多艺的人。
    建设社会主义就应该是这样。在大跃进的时代里，生产不断发展，技术不断革新，这就需要千千万万像张化吉小组工人和李真芬那样的多才多艺的人。
    “多才多艺”意味着辛勤劳动，钻研出巧匠，艺多效率高。这样的人多了，就能加速我们社会主义建设的脚步。
