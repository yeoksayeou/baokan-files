The old road of British imperialism is a dead end
Representative Han Wangchen warns Indian expansionists

Fellow Representatives:

After listening to Premier Zhou's report, I am very excited. I feel that our motherland's achievements are truly magnificent and bright, and the various principles and policies adopted are completely correct. Premier Zhou's report is an action program for the people of the whole country to realize the construction tasks of 1959. The industrialists and businessmen of Shaanxi Province will certainly follow the instructions in the Premier's report and work with the broad masses of people to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan.

Since the anti-Rightist and rectification campaigns, our industrialists and businessmen have gradually come to realize the corruption of capitalism and the superiority of socialism, and more and more people are willing to "destroy capitalism and establish socialism." According to incomplete statistics from 74 counties and cities including Xi'an, Baoji, and Weinan, 14,548 private personnel have made self-transformation plans, and 12,565 small industrialists and businessmen have made collective covenants. The vast majority of people have participated in various forms of physical labor, striving to train themselves in labor. Last year, 10,812 industrialists and businessmen in Longxian, Fuping, Baishui and other places participated in the summer harvest, 4,795 participated in the autumn harvest and autumn planting, and 5,462 participated in manure accumulation; particularly encouraged by the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, private personnel also actively contributed their skills and ideas. For example, 729 private personnel in Lianhu District of Xi'an City put forward a total of 43,629 rationalization proposals, of which 16,499 were adopted.

These situations show that in the past year, under the correct leadership of the Party, industrialists and businessmen in Shaanxi have made certain progress through the anti-Rightist and rectification campaigns. However, not everyone has completely overcome the dual nature of the bourgeoisie and changed their position. The progress is still very uneven; some have transformed better, while others are worse. This uneven situation can be clearly seen. Those who have transformed better serve better, and those who have transformed worse serve worse. The situation in Xi'an City can illustrate this problem. In the first quarter of this year, 5,536 industrialists and businessmen in Xi'an City reviewed their self-transformation plans. The review showed that those who seriously transformed and implemented their self-transformation plans better generally paid close attention to learning and labor, cared about socialist construction, showed more positive work performance, were willing to contribute their personal talents, and further moved closer to the Party. They were also able to humbly learn from the workers and masses, and gradually shortened the distance between themselves and the working class in terms of ideological feelings. A few well-transformed people have already achieved remarkable results in their work. For example, three private personnel in the Xi'an Glass Factory have transformed very well since the rectification campaign, are able to mingle with the workers, and, with the support of the enterprise Party organization, have successfully trial-produced many new products, such as standard bottles, desiccators, carbonic acid determinators, fat extractors, gas analyzers, condensers, spherical oil bottles, and flasks for medical equipment. Among them, the heat resistance of the flasks reached 290 degrees Celsius, exceeding the ministry's standard and catching up with the international level. Some private personnel have been rated as advanced producers and advanced workers.

Those who have transformed poorly are in a different situation. Although these people have the desire to strengthen transformation and actively serve, they are not active in action, have low morale, are worried about gains and losses, and have many concerns. They often emphasize that they are busy with work, are unwilling to study seriously, or think that studying is too tight, do not work hard to transform themselves in labor, and think that they have already been reborn and are almost the same as the working class after their skin is tanned. They are also often "I" centered, have not completely overcome the dual nature of the bourgeoisie, and personal and collective contradictions often occur in the service process. Some people are not convinced by the workers' inventions and creations, suspect that the Party only supports the workers and does not value themselves, and think that they have a belly full of "butterflies" that cannot fly out (referring to wanting to make contributions but being afraid that the Party will not value them). Some people take a so-called "semi-participating" attitude towards the technical revolution, thinking that they dare to think, dare to say, but dare not do, for fear of engaging in capitalism and making mistakes. There are also some people who have the idea of making a splash and want to work on their own behind closed doors. Still others think that the business they are engaged in is simple and will not produce anything famous. Those with these bad performances always have a certain distance from the Party and the working class, lack drive, and hold an attitude of seeking no merit but avoiding fault or muddling along in their work.

The facts are very clear. China's industrial and commercial circles are not incapable of being transformed, nor are they incapable of making contributions to socialism. As long as they can seriously transform themselves, they can serve socialism and make contributions to socialism. Through practical work and self-transformation, they can achieve their transformation wishes. We must combine transformation with service. The more we transform, the more we serve; the less we transform, the less we serve. Moreover, without practical work and service, transformation will not achieve very good results. In the process of assisting the transformation and self-transformation of industrial and commercial circles, we have increasingly realized the importance of combining this transformation with service. We believe that industrial and commercial circles must follow this policy in order to achieve double harvests in thought and work. This is the correct way of transformation.

According to the policy of combining transformation with service, how can our industrialists and businessmen further contribute their strength to socialism and achieve the goal of transformation? We have learned that the following points are very important:

First, we must rely on the leadership of the Party. We have personally experienced that the reason why our industrial and commercial circles have achieved some success is because the Party has given us direction, the Party has given us strength, and the Party has given us methods. Those so-called statements that the Party does not trust or support private parties are inconsistent with the facts, and therefore wrong. The facts tell us that industrialists and businessmen must put politics in command in transformation and service, and first of all, they must firmly trust the Party. I deeply realize that relying on the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for doing all work well.

Second, we must focus on the central tasks of the enterprise and give play to individual roles. Premier Zhou's report has pointed out the central tasks of the people of the whole country this year. We must have the idea of the whole country as one game, give play to our own strength according to the central tasks of the enterprise in each period, and strive to complete the national economic construction tasks. If we aim too high and engage in our own things, deviating from the central work, it will be difficult to effectively exert our strength, it will be difficult to adapt to the new situation of leaping forward and making another leap, and we may even make mistakes. We believe that focusing on the central tasks of the enterprise is the best way to implement "taking the enterprise as the base for transformation." Only in this way can we win double harvests in service and transformation.

Third, we must learn the noble qualities of the working class. We should not only work hard and complete our work tasks with guaranteed quality and quantity, but also sincerely learn from the working class in labor, learn the real skills and noble qualities of the working class, transform ourselves into a veritable worker, and contribute the greatest strength to socialism. This is a very valuable experience. If we can eat, live, and work with the workers, we will discover the strengths of the working class, we will gradually realize that we are not as good as the workers, we will take the workers as our teachers, and we will be gradually transformed. Some people are still unwilling to do this, so it is difficult to transform well and serve well.

Fourth, we must be determined to break with the capitalist standpoint and establish a socialist standpoint. Although our industrial and commercial circles have made progress to varying degrees in recent years, the bourgeois standpoint, viewpoints, and methods have not been fundamentally changed. In the process of service, it is inevitable that some old standpoints, viewpoints, and methods will be exposed. We should be determined to change them in the process of service. Don't be nostalgic for the old things, and be determined to break with the old things completely. We must regard the process of service as a process of self-transformation. Exposure is not a bad thing, but a good thing. The old standpoints, viewpoints, and methods are objectively present, and they will be exposed even if they are not exposed. It is better to expose them boldly than to be afraid of exposure. The problem is not in whether or not to expose, but in whether or not we are determined to transform ourselves. As long as we humbly accept the education of the Party and the help of the workers and staff, gradually overcome these capitalist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, and contribute our useful talents, it will not only be good for socialism, but also good for ourselves. Otherwise, we will get the opposite result. The problem is very clear, is it better to expose or not to expose? I think the key to "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism" lies in exposing the old things, and we must expose them boldly.

Although we have these experiences in self-transformation, they are not well combined with work, which is greatly related to the old ideological style. In the future, we must seriously change this situation. Secondly, I would like to say a few words about the recent rebellion in Tibet, China.

Just as the people of all ethnic groups in our country are summing up the great achievements of our country in carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction in the past six years with joy and excitement and are welcoming the 1959 construction tasks of continuing the Great Leap Forward with a hundredfold confidence, the former Tibet local government and the upper-level reactionary clique are so mad that they disregard the national law, collude with imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs and foreign reactionaries, and openly launched an armed rebellion in March of this year in an attempt to split the motherland and restore the power of imperialism in Tibet, thus forever preserving their backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel rule imposed on the Tibetan people.

For more than a month, the imperialists, who have always been hostile to the Chinese people, have tried their best to use the Tibetan rebellion to attack our country and wantonly slander it. This is predictable and not surprising. However, what is very surprising is that in our great neighboring country, India, which has a long tradition of friendship with our country and jointly advocates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, many indignant discussions and inappropriate practices have also appeared after the Tibetan rebellion. The people of our country hate the rebels, but the expansionists and some politicians in India "sympathize" and "support" the rebels; we believe that the behavior of the rebels is to betray the motherland and undermine unity, but the expansionists in India believe that these people's deeds are so-called "expressions of patriotic sentiment"; it is clear that the Tibetan people are members of the national family of our country, but some politicians in India insist that "Tibetans are Tibetans, not Chinese"; in our country, those who are regarded as traitors by the people of all ethnic groups are respected as "honored guests" by some politicians in India, and are therefore warmly welcomed and cordially entertained. Even on the 18th of this month, a so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" was openly distributed by officials of the Indian government! Are these the words and deeds that our friendly neighbor should have? Do these conform to the Five Principles advocated by the Indian government? Are these just expressions of religious etiquette and not interference in our country's internal affairs? Is there any difference between these words and deeds and the slanders and conspiracies of the imperialists against our country?

I think it is necessary for us to solemnly declare to the Indian expansionists and some hot-headed politicians today:

(1) Tibet is an inalienable part of our sacred Chinese territory. Any conspiracy to split our country's territory will be completely smashed by the people of our country, including the Tibetan people!

(2) We are already the Chinese people who have stood up. Our internal affairs will not allow any foreign interference!

At the same time, we also remind these Indian expansionists and politicians: the old road of British imperialism is a dead end! Your current words and deeds can only be welcomed and used by the imperialists, and will not bring any benefits to the friendly relations between China and India!

The practice of "those close to us are hurt" and "those who hate us are happy" should be changed!

Now, our country is striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The people of the whole country are high-spirited, full of vigor, red flags are flying everywhere, and revolutionary enthusiasm is boiling. Under this situation, our industrial and commercial circles must take effective measures, conscientiously implement the policy of combining transformation and service, be honest and diligent, go all out, strive for the top, and contribute technical talents in every possible way to make more, greater, and more outstanding achievements, and present gifts to the tenth National Day.

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the great and wise leader Chairman Mao!

### 英帝国主义的老路是死胡同  韩望尘代表对印度的扩张主义分子提出警告

专栏：

    英帝国主义的老路是死胡同
    韩望尘代表对印度的扩张主义分子提出警告各位代表：
    听了周总理的报告，我非常兴奋。感到我们祖国的成就，真是辉煌灿烂，前途光明万丈，采取的各项方针政策完全正确。周总理的报告是全国人民实现一九五九年建设任务的行动纲领，我们陕西省的工商业者，一定遵照总理报告中的指示，和广大人民一起为完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    自从反右、整风以来，我们工商业者对资本主义的腐朽性和社会主义的优越性，逐步有了认识，愿意“破资立社”的人，愈　来愈多了。据西安、宝鸡、渭南等七十四县、市的不完全统计，有一万四千五百四十八个私方人员订了自我改造规划，一万二千五百六十五个小型工商业者订了集体公约，绝大多数的人，都参加了各种形式的体力劳动，争取在劳动中锻炼自己。去年陇县、富平、白水等地有一万零八百一十二个工商业者，参加了夏收，四千七百九十五人参加了秋收秋播，五千四百六十二人参加了积肥；特别受到工农群众冲天干劲的鼓舞，私方人员也积极起来献技献计。例如，西安市莲湖区的七百二十九个私方人员，共提出合理化建议四万三千六百二十九条，其中，被采纳的就有一万六千四百九十九条。
    这些情况说明：一年来，陕西工商业者在党的正确领导下，通过反右、整风有了一定进步。但不是人人都完全克服了资产阶级的两面性，改变了立场，而是进步还很不平衡，有的改造得比较好，有的就差一些。这种不平衡的情况，可以显然看出。凡是改造较好的人服务就比较好，改造差一些的人，服务也就差一些。从西安市的情况就能说明这个问题。今年在一季度，西安市有五千五百三十六个工商业者都检查了自己的自我改造规划。从检查看，凡是认真改造，执行自我改造规划较好的人，对学习、劳动，一般抓得较紧，关心社会主义建设，工作表现较积极，愿意贡献个人才能，进一步向党靠拢了，并能虚心向职工群众学习，在思想感情上逐步缩短了同工人阶级的距离，少数改造好的人，已经在工作上取得了显著成绩，例如西安玻璃厂有三个私方人员，自整风后转变很好，能和工人打成一片，在企业党组织的支持下，试制成功了许多新产品，如医疗器械中的标准瓶，干燥器，碳酸测定器，脂肪抽出器，气体分析器，冷凝器，球形油瓶，烧瓶等，其中烧瓶的耐热度达到摄氏二百九十度，超过部定标准，赶上了国际水平。有的私方人员已被评选为先进生产者和先进工作者。
    改造差的人，又是另外一种情况，这些人虽有加强改造和积极服务的愿望，但行动不积极，情绪不高，患得患失，顾虑很多。他们往往强调工作忙，不愿意认真学习，或认为学习逼得紧，不好好工作，在劳动中不下苦功改造自己，认为皮肤晒黑了就已经脱胎换骨，改造得和工人阶级差不多了。他们还常常是“我”字当头，未完全克服资产阶级的两面性，在服务过程中，常发生个人与集体的矛盾。有些人对工人的创造发明不服气，怀疑党只支持工人，不重视自己，认为有满肚子的“蝴蝶”飞不出来（指想有所贡献，怕党不重视）。有的人对技术革命，抱着所谓“半参加”的态度，认为自己敢想、敢说、不敢干，怕干成资本主义，犯错误。还有一些人有一鸣惊人思想，关在房内想自搞一套。另有一些人认为自己所搞业务简单，不会搞出什么名堂。有这些表现不好的人，总是和党和工人阶级之间有一定的距离，干劲不足，在工作中抱着不求有功，但求无过或得过且过的态度。
    事实摆得很明显。中国的工商界不是不能改造，也不是不能为社会主义立功。只要能认真改造，就能为社会主义服务，为社会主义立功，并通过实际工作进行自我改造，就能达到改造愿望。我们必须要改造与服务相结合。改造多一分，服务就多一分；改造少一分，服务就少一分。而且不通过实际工作和服务，改造也收不到很好的效果。我们在协助工商界改造和自我改造的过程中，已日益认识这种改造与服务相结合的重要性，我们认为工商界必须遵循这种方针，才能在思想和工作上双丰收，这是改造的正确途径。
    根据改造与服务相结合的方针，我们工商业者怎样才能进一步为社会主义贡献自己的力量，达到改造的目的呢？我们体会到有以下几点很重要：
    第一、必须依靠党的领导。我们亲身体会到，我们工商界之所以有些成就，就因为党给了我们方向，党给了我们力量，党给了我们方法，那些所谓党对私方不信任，不支持的说法，都是不合事实的，因而也是错误的。事实告诉我们，工商业者要在改造和服务中政治挂帅，首先要坚决信任党，我深刻体会到，依靠党的领导，是作好一切工作的根本保证。
    第二、必须围绕企业的中心任务，发挥个人作用。周总理的报告中，已指出了今年全国人民的中心任务。我们必须要有全国一盘棋的思想，根据各个时期企业的中心任务，发挥自己力量，为完成国家的经济建设任务而努力。如果好高骛远，各搞一套，脱离中心工作，那就很难有效的发挥力量，很难适应跃进再跃进的新形势，甚至还会犯错误。我们认为：围绕企业的中心任务，是贯彻“以企业为改造基地”的最好办法。只有这样办，才能赢得服务与改造的双丰收。
    第三、必须学习工人阶级的高贵品质。我们不仅应该认真地劳动，保质保量地完成工作任务，还必须在劳动中真心实意地向工人阶级学习，学习工人阶级真实的本领和高贵的品质，把自己改造成为一个名副其实的劳动者，为社会主义贡献最大的力量。这是一个非常宝贵的经验，我们如果能和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，就会发现工人阶级的长处，就会逐步认识到自己不如工人，就会拜劳动者为师，就能逐步得到改造。有些人还不愿这样做，就难很好地改造和很好地服务。
    第四、必须下决心破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场。虽然我们工商界几年来，有不同程度的进步，但是资产阶级的立场、观点和方法尚未根本改变，在服务的过程中，不可避免地会暴露出某些旧的立场、观点和方法，应该下决心在服务过程中予以改变，不要留恋旧的东西，要有决心与旧的东西彻底决裂。我们要把服务的过程，看做是进行自我改造的过程。暴露并不是坏事，而是好事，旧的立场、观点、方法是客观存在，不暴露也得暴露，怕暴露不如大胆暴露，想包是包不住的。我觉得好坏不在于暴露与不暴露，而在于有无决心改造自己，只要我们虚心接受党的教育和职工的帮助，逐步克服这些资本主义的立场、观点和方法，把自己有用的才能贡献出来，不但对社会主义有好处，对自己也有好处。否则会得到相反的结果。问题很明显，暴露好还是不暴露好呢？我认为“破资立社”，关键在于暴露旧的东西，要大胆的暴露。
    我们在自我改造当中，虽然有这些体会，但和工作结合不够，这和旧的思想作风有很大关系。今后我们要认真改变这种情况。其次我想就最近在我国西藏所发生的叛乱事件讲一点意见。
    正当我全国各族人民以欢欣鼓舞的心情总结我国在过去六年间进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就并以百倍信心迎接继续大跃进的一九五九年建设任务的时候，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团竟然丧心病狂，无视国法，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和国外反动派，于本年三月公然发动武装叛乱，企图分裂祖国，恢复帝国主义在西藏的势力，从而永远保存他们所加于西藏人民的落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的统治。
    一个多月来，一贯敌视中国人民的帝国主义者，极力利用西藏叛乱事件对我国大加攻击，肆意诬蔑。这是可以预料得到而不足为怪的。但是，令人十分惊异的是：在和我国有着悠久传统友谊并和我国共同倡导和平共处五项原则的我们的伟大邻邦——印度，在这次西藏叛乱发生后，竟然也出现了许多令人愤慨的议论和不恰当的作法。我们全国人民痛恨叛乱分子，而印度的扩张主义者和某些政治家却“同情”和“支持”叛乱分子；我们认为叛乱分子的行为是背叛祖国、破坏统一，而印度的扩张主义者却认为这些人的勾当是所谓“爱国情绪的流露”；明明西藏人民是我国民族大家庭中的一员，而印度的某些政治家却硬说“西藏人是西藏人，不是中国人”；在我国，被全国各族人民视为叛国的人，而在印度却被某些政治家尊之为“贵宾”，因而热烈欢迎，殷勤招待。甚至在本月十八日，一份所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，也竟公然由印度政府的官员亲手散发！凡此种种，难道是我们的友好的邻邦所应有的言行吗？难道这是符合印度政府所倡导的五项原则吗？难道这只是宗教礼节上的表示而不是干涉我国的内政吗？难道这些言行和帝国主义者对我国的诬蔑和阴谋还有什么区别吗？
    我以为时至今日，我们有必要向印度的扩张主义分子和某些头脑发热的政治家郑重宣告：
    （1）西藏是我们中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分。任何分裂我国领土的阴谋，必将遭到我全国人民包括西藏人民在内的彻底粉碎！
    （2）我们已经是站起了的中国人民。我们的内政，决不容许任何外国干涉! 
    同时我们也提醒这些印度的扩张主义分子和政治家：英帝国主义的老路是走不通的了！你们目前的言行只能受到帝国主义者的欢迎与利用，决不会给我们中印两国的友好关系带来任何好处！
    “亲者所痛”而“仇者所快”的作法，应该是改变的时候了！
    现在，我们国家正在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，争取更大、更好、更全面的跃进。全国人民，斗志昂扬，意气风发，到处红旗招展，革命热情沸腾，在这个形势下，我们工商界更要采取有效措施，认真执行改造与服务相结合的方针，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，鼓足干劲、力争上游，千方百计地贡献技术才能，做出更多更大更出色的成绩，向十届国庆献礼。
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大英明的领袖毛主席万岁！
