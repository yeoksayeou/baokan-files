    Collaboration and mutual support, advancing together, is the heroic nature of the working people of our era. Within a region or a people's commune, due to differing conditions in various aspects, there will always be distinctions between those who are more advanced and those who are more backward in their work, between those who are more prosperous and those who are less prosperous. Therefore, when completing a task, there will always be those who come first and those who come later, those who are faster and those who are slower. The responsibility of leaders lies in enabling the backward to quickly catch up with the advanced, and to jointly create a prosperous new life at the fastest speed. In particular, agricultural production is highly seasonal, requiring us to seize the time, catch the opportune moment, and complete farming tasks on time, with good quality, and in sufficient quantity. Therefore, it is naturally essential to organize a certain degree of support and collaboration among different regions, communes, and production teams.

    When collaboration is mentioned, many people easily think of large-scale battles, unpaid voluntary labor, and so on. This is only one form of collaboration, a form that we have used in the past, especially last year, and it has achieved great results. However, this form is only suitable for use when production truly requires it and tasks are extremely urgent. More frequent and regular collaboration should be production collaboration and mutual support between labor production groups within production teams and between production teams within communes. Regardless of the type of collaboration and mutual support, the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit should be implemented.

    Is it not contradictory to say that we must have both collaboration and equivalent mutual benefit?

    Since the social nature of our country is still a socialist society, since two forms of ownership still exist in our country, and since the principle of distribution according to work and the law of value still play a positive role in the development of socialist production, we must act in accordance with these principles when solving and handling any problems. Since our principle of distribution is distribution according to work, we must also recognize that the quantity and quality of labor is the measure of personal consumption. Correspondingly, when mutual assistance and collaboration are carried out between production teams and between communes, the principle of payment according to work and equivalent exchange should also be implemented. This will not only not hinder collaboration, nor contradict collaboration. On the contrary, because it combines the interests of individuals and collectives, it is more conducive to the unity of the working people and the promotion of the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses, and more conducive to the wide-ranging development of collaboration and the improvement of labor productivity. The fact that Pingnan County, Guangxi, is organizing mutually beneficial collaboration to promote production in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange, as reported in today's newspaper, is the best proof of this.

    Does organizing collaboration, implementing equivalent exchange, and providing labor remuneration hinder the development of communist style? Does it affect the improvement of collectivist and socialist ideological consciousness? Obviously not. This kind of mutual assistance and collaboration among the working people is itself a practical manifestation of collectivist and socialist ideology. Please see the examples of Ganlong Brigade and Pingshan Brigade of Pingshan Commune in Pingnan County, Guangxi. These two teams are competitive rivals. When Ganlong Brigade saw that Pingshan Brigade was about to miss the planting season and lacked rice seedlings, they did not ignore the difficulties of their competition rivals because of the competition for the championship red flag. Instead, they used their own people and their own rice seedlings to help the other party overcome difficulties. The supporters first thought not of honor and reward, but of how to help the supported to advance together. Isn't this a concrete manifestation of collectivist and socialist ideology? Isn't this a development of communist style? Based on the same idea, the supported party pays a certain remuneration so as not to affect the development of the other party's production because of their help, and so as not to cause difficulties in the other party's work because of their help. Isn't this also a concrete manifestation of collectivist and socialist ideology? Isn't this also a development of communist style? Here, collaboration and mutual benefit have merged into one.

    协作和互利
    苏宜
    互相支援协作，大家共同跃进，是我们这时代劳动人民的英雄本色。在一个地区或一个人民公社内，由于各方面的条件不同，总会有工作比较先进和比较落后的区别，比较富裕和比较不富裕的区别，因此在完成一件任务的时候，总会有先有后有快有慢。领导者的责任就是在于使落后的迅速赶上先进，以最快的速度共同创造富裕的新生活。特别是农业生产季节性强，要抢时间，赶火候，按时按质按量地完成耕作任务。因此，在各个不同的地区、公社、生产队之间组织一定的支援和协作，自然就成为十分必要的了。
    一提到协作，很多人容易想到大兵团作战，不计报酬的义务劳动等等。这只是协作中的一种形式，这种形式我们在过去、特别在去年曾经运用过，而且收到很大效果。但是这种形式只宜于在生产的确需要、任务十分紧急的时候采用，更多的更经常的协作应该是生产队内部各劳动生产组之间、公社内部各生产队之间的生产协作和互相支援。无论哪一种协作和相互支援，都应该贯彻等价互利的原则。
    既是协作，又要等价互利，这不是矛盾的吗？
    既然我们国家的社会性质仍然是社会主义社会，既然我国还存在着两种所有制，既然按劳分配的原则和价值规律等等在发展社会主义生产中仍起着积极的作用，我们在解决和处理任何问题的时候，就要按照这些原则办事。既然我们的分配原则是按劳分配，我们也就必须承认劳动的数量和质量是占有个人消费品的尺度。与此相适应，在各个生产队之间、公社之间进行互助和协作的时候，同样应该执行按劳付酬，等价交换的原则。这样不仅不会妨碍协作，不仅不会与协作矛盾，恰好相反，由于把个人和集体这一部分和那一部分的利益结合了起来，更有利于劳动人民内部的团结和广大群众劳动积极性的发扬，更有利于协作的广泛开展和劳动生产率的提高。今天本报发表的广西平南县按照等价交换原则，组织互利协作推动生产的事实就是最好的证明。
    组织协作，实行了等价交换，给予了劳动报酬，是不是就妨碍了共产主义风格的发扬？是不是就会影响集体主义、社会主义思想觉悟的提高了呢？显然不是这样。劳动人民之间这种互相帮助，共同协作本身，就是集体主义、社会主义思想的实际表现。请看，这里是广西平南县平山公社橄垌大队和平山大队的例证，这两个队是竞赛的对手，当橄垌大队看到平山大队插秧将赶不上季节并缺少稻秧的时候，他们没有因为争夺优胜红旗，对竞赛对手的困难置之不顾，而是用自己的人、自己的稻秧帮助对方克服困难。支援者首先想到的不是荣誉和报酬，而是想到怎样帮助被支援者共同跃进。这难道不是集体主义、社会主义思想的具体表现么？这难道不是共产主义风格的发扬吗？被支援者基于同样的思想，付出一定的报酬，以便不致因为帮助自己而影响了对方生产的发展，不致因帮助自己而造成对方工作上的困难，这难道不是同样的集体主义、社会主义思想的具体表现么？这难道不是同样的共产主义风格的发扬吗？在这里，协作和互利已经溶合为一了。
