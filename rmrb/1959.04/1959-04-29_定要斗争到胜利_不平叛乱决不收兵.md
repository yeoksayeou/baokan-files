To the Editor:

    We are extremely angered to read in the newspapers that Indian expansionists are grossly interfering in our internal affairs by using our suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as a pretext, undermining the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated by China and India, and insulting the portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in China.

    Tibet has been an inalienable part of China since ancient times. Suppressing a rebellion on Chinese territory is purely China's internal affair, and no one has the right to interfere.

    We warn those expansionists with ulterior motives to open your eyes and see the changes in great China. The current China is not the old China before liberation, but a new China that has stood up. The Chinese people will not invade others, but once others invade our people, we will certainly give a resolute counterattack.

    We, the defenders of the People's Republic of China, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, resolutely execute the orders of the State Council and fight to safeguard the unity of all ethnic groups and the unification of the motherland. We will not withdraw our troops until the Tibetan rebellion is completely quelled! All imperialist elements and Indian expansionists, stop daydreaming!
          All comrades of the Second Platoon, Fourth Detachment, Second Branch, Unit 3697

    定要斗争到胜利
    不平叛乱决不收兵编辑同志：
    从报纸上看到印度的扩张主义分子借我国平息西藏叛乱事件，粗暴地干涉我国内政，破坏中印两国首创的和平共处五项原则，并对我国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席像进行侮辱，使我们非常愤怒。
    西藏自古以来，就是我国领土的一部分，在我国的领土上平息叛乱纯属中国内政，别人无权过问。
    警告那些居心不良的扩张主义分子，你们要睁开眼睛，看看伟大中国的变化。现在的中国不是解放前的旧中国，她已经是站起来了的新中国。中国人民不会去侵犯别人，但是一旦别人侵犯到我国人民的身上，就一定给以坚决的反击。
    我们——中华人民共和国的保卫者，人民解放军的战士，坚决执行国务院的命令，为维护各民族的团结和祖国的统一而斗争，不彻底平息西藏叛乱决不收兵！一切帝国主义分子和印度的扩张主义者，你们别白日做梦了！
          3697部队二支队四分队二排全体同志
