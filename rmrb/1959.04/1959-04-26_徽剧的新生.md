    The Rebirth of Huiju Opera
    An Ming

    After more than one hundred and sixty years, Anhui's Huiju Opera is once again meeting the people of Beijing with a brand new look.

    Huiju Opera is an ancient Chinese opera form. It took shape in southern Anhui during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. It has many plays and rich tunes. Erhuang, Baizi, Chuichang (Zongyang Tune, Shipai Tune), and Gaoqiang (Qingyang Tune) are its main melodies, and Kunqu also occupies a certain proportion. It can appropriately use different tunes to express many different plays.

    During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Huiju Opera gradually spread from Anhui to other provinces. At this time, many famous artists emerged from the Huiju troupes. In the late Qianlong period, Yangzhou held a centralized performance of operas from various regions. The famous Huiju artists Gao Langting and Hao Tianxiu brought Huiju Opera to Yangzhou, winning the audience's praise and being called "excellent in both appearance and artistry." In the 55th year of Qianlong, Gao Langting brought the Huiju troupe - Sanqing Troupe - to Beijing, causing a sensation in the Beijing art scene and being praised as "a blockbuster." Gao Langting was then known as the "doyen of Erhuang." This famous Dan (female role) actor was described as: "Once on stage, he is completely like a woman; every frown and smile is almost perfect." But he was not satisfied with this, and further absorbed the Jing (high-pitched tunes popular in Beijing) and Qin tunes. In the process of its formation, Huiju Opera absorbed the excellent elements of brother opera forms, including Gaoqiang and Qinqiang. At this time, it was further developed, for example, absorbing Qinqiang to produce Xipi.

    After the Sanqing Troupe entered Beijing, the Sixi, Chuntai, and Hechun three Huiju troupes also entered Beijing successively, which were the Four Great Anhui Troupes. Later, more and more artists from Anhui came to Beijing. "Meng Hua Suo Bu" written by a person in the Daoguang period said: "Opera houses must perform with Anhui troupes"; "Chang'an Kan Hua Ji" recorded: "Most of the Liyuan (opera world) actors are from Anhui."

    During the Xianfeng period, Cheng Changgeng appeared in the Huiju troupe. "Cheng was proficient in Kunqu and most skilled in Erhuang. His voice was extremely high, and when he sang on stage, it resounded through the clouds. He was intelligent, proficient in opera music, and studied various aspects, making many improvements to help the progress of drama." (See "A History of Modern Chinese Drama"). Before entering Beijing, Cheng Changgeng had studied Han Opera. After entering Beijing, he absorbed the essence of Han Opera, and further integrated the vocal music and performance of Kunqu and Yiyangqiang into Pihuang, making Huiju Opera more substantial. "Preface to Qin Yun Xie Ying Xiao Pu" recorded: "Cheng Changgeng from Anhui... thoroughly researched the methods of adjusting voice and breathing in the Hubei tune, singing with sighs and pauses, making people feel exhilarated and refreshed. The world calls it the Beijing Erhuang." After Cheng Changgeng, famous artists such as Yang Yuelou, Yang Xiaolou, and Wang Hongshou appeared in the Huiju troupe. Because they were all from near Shipai, Huaining, Anhui, there was a saying at the time that "no troupe can be formed without Shipai people."

    Although Huiju Opera was once extremely prosperous in history, before liberation, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Anhui's Huiju Opera was severely damaged. The Huiju troupes gradually declined. During the Anti-Japanese War, all Huiju troupes were forced to disband. Huiju Opera artists lived in hardship and all scattered among the people, changing to other professions. Since then, the formal Huiju Opera troupes disappeared.

    After liberation, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attached great importance to Huiju Opera. Under the guidance of the Party Central Committee's policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weeding Through the Old to Bring Forth the New," it was decided to re-establish the Huiju Opera Troupe, so that this opera form could regain its youth. The Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, on the one hand, sent people to go deep into various parts of Anhui to excavate Huiju Opera heritage, collect and record scripts; on the other hand, it visited, gathered and hired more than a dozen old Huiju Opera artists scattered among the people, and also recruited child students to establish the Anhui Provincial Huiju Opera Troupe. After several years of work, the Anhui Provincial Huiju Opera Troupe has now collected more than seven hundred Huiju Opera manuscripts, registered more than one thousand plays including various tunes, and investigated and recorded many Huiju Opera troupes' arias, musical tunes, and historical materials of Huiju Opera troupes. The child students of the Anhui Provincial Huiju Opera Troupe, after the careful education of the old artists and their own hard work, have also learned forty plays. They are learning culture and acting at the same time, and have become the new force of Huiju Opera.

    Huiju Opera has its own characteristics. Its tunes are rich and its voice is high-pitched and clear. The lyrics and dialogues are also relatively beautiful and easy to understand. The structure of many plays is relatively concise and skillful, focusing on performance, with few words and many actions. Whether it is action, singing, or dialogue, the rhythm is relatively strong. The accompaniment music also varies depending on the play and tune. Although these have generally been accepted by Peking Opera, we still can see the unique style and distinct local characteristics of Huiju Opera when we re-watch it.

    Among the plays performed by the Anhui Provincial Huiju Opera Troupe in Beijing this time, the main ones are: "Water Flooding the Seven Armies," which is Chuichang and Baizi; "Meeting at the Mill," which is Qingyang Tune; "Gifting the Sword" (Phoenix Mountain), etc., which is Chuichang; "King Qi Inspecting Horses" which is Pihuang; "Drunkenly Beating the Mountain Gate" which is Kunqu. People will see the outline of the development of Huiju Opera from these few plays, and its richness in tunes and performances. And the energetic and solid performances of the child actors of the Huiju Opera Troupe will also make people feel excited. Huiju Opera, which was almost lost, has already sprouted green leaves, bloomed red flowers, and appeared in a thriving new spring scene under the cultivation of the Party.

    徽剧的新生
    安明
    时隔一百六十多年，安徽的徽剧，又以崭新的面貌，和北京人民见面了。
    徽剧是我国一个古老的剧种，它在明末清初形成于安徽南部，剧目很多，腔调丰富，二黄、拨子、吹腔（枞阳腔、石牌腔）、高腔（青阳腔）是它的主调，昆腔也占一定的比重，对于许多不同的戏，能够运用不同的腔调适当地加以表达。
    在清朝乾隆年间，徽剧逐渐由安徽传到外省，这时候徽班中产生了很多著名的艺人。乾隆末年，扬州曾经举行各地戏曲集中演出，徽剧名艺人高朗亭、郝天秀便把徽剧带到扬州演出，博得观众好评，被称之为“色艺俱佳”。清乾隆55年，高朗亭把徽班——三庆班带到了北京演出，轰动北京艺坛，誉为“一鸣惊人”。高朗亭当时被称为“二黄之耆宿”，他这个名旦被形容为：一上氍毹，宛然巾帼，一颦一笑，几乎化境”。但他并不因此满足，又进一步吸收了京（流行在北京的高腔）、秦两腔。徽剧在形成过程中，是吸收了兄弟剧种的优秀的东西的，其中就含有高腔、秦腔的成份，这时候又得到了进一步的发展，例如吸取秦腔而产生了西皮。
    三庆班入京以后，四喜、春台、和春三个徽班也相继入京，这就是四大徽班。以后安徽的艺人到北京的越来越多，道光时人写的“梦华琐簿”说：“戏庄演剧必徽班”；“长安看花记”载称：“梨园子弟多皖人”。
    咸丰年间，徽班中出现了一个程长庚。“程本精昆曲、最工二黄。声调绝高，登台一奏，响彻云霄。资性颖慧，精通剧曲，研究种种，多所改良，以助戏剧进步。”（见中国近世戏剧史）。程长庚入京以前，曾经学过汉剧，入京后，又吸取了汉剧精华，同时进一步把昆腔、弋阳腔的声腔和表演融合到皮、黄中来，使徽剧更加充实。“秦云撷英小谱序”记载说：“徽人程长庚……于湖广调中，精求所以调声运气之法，一唱三叹，听之使人荡气娱神，世称京二黄。”在程长庚之后，徽班中又出现了著名艺人杨月楼、杨小楼、王鸿寿等，因为他们都是安徽怀宁石牌附近的人，因而当时有“无石不成班”之称。
    徽剧虽然在历史上曾经盛极一时，但是在解放前，在国民党的反动统治下，安徽的徽剧遭到严重破坏，徽班逐渐衰落，抗日战争时期，所有徽班都被迫解散，徽剧艺人生活困苦，全都流落民间，改习他业，从此，徽剧的正式班社便消声绝迹。
    解放以后，中共安徽省委对徽剧非常重视，在党中央的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针指导下决定重新建立徽剧团，使这一剧种重获青春。安徽省文化局根据省委指示一方面派人深入安徽各地，挖掘徽剧遗产，搜集和记录剧本；一方面访集聘请流散民间的十多个徽剧老艺人，同时招收了儿童学员，成立安徽省徽剧团。经过几年的工作，现在安徽省徽剧团已经搜集到七百多个徽剧抄本，登记了一千多个包括各种腔调的剧目，调查和记录了很多徽班的唱腔、曲牌等及徽剧班社的历史材料。安徽省徽剧团的儿童学员经过老艺人的悉心教育和自己的勤学苦练，也已经学会了四十个戏，他们一边学文化一边学演戏，已成为徽剧的新生力量。
    徽剧是有它的特色的，它的曲调丰富，声调高亢爽朗；唱词、说白也比较优美，通俗易懂；不少戏的结构比较精练，纯熟，着重表演，词少，动作多，无论动作、唱、白的节奏都比较强，伴奏音乐也因戏因腔调而各有不同，这些虽然一般都已经被京剧所接受，但是我们重看徽剧，仍然可以看到徽剧的特独风格和鲜明的地方色彩。
    这次安徽省徽剧团在北京演出的剧目中，主要的有：“水淹七军”，是吹腔，拨子；“磨房会”，是青阳腔；“赠剑”（凤凰山）等，是吹腔，“齐王点马”是皮黄；“醉打山门”是昆腔。人们将从这几个戏中，看到徽剧的发展梗概，和它在曲调、表演方面的丰富多彩。而徽剧团儿童演员朝气蓬勃、功夫扎实的表演，也将使人们感到兴奋。几乎失传的徽剧，在党的栽培下，已经在长绿叶，开红花，出现了欣欣向荣的新的青春景色。
