　　“To Ascend Another Story, To See a Thousand Miles Further”
　　Wang Xuan
    When the great scientist Newton, at the age of eighty-five, was on his deathbed, he said very humbly: "I don't know how the world sees me, but I only feel like a child playing on the seashore, sometimes happily picking up a smooth and beautiful pebble, but the ocean of truth, I have not yet discovered." Then he said: "If I see a little further than Descartes, it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants." The famous Russian fabulist Krylov, when his friend praised his books for being well-written and selling many copies, also humbly replied: "No, it's not that my books are well-written, it's because my books are for children, and children easily damage books, so the number of editions printed is high." From these two people's words, we see a noble image of humility and open-mindedness. What a great educational effect this has on us!
    The Party and Chairman Mao constantly tell us to be humble. Humility is a virtue of communists, and it is this spirit of humility that guides us to continue to move forward.
    Humility is the sweet fruit borne by the "big tree" of "lofty goals" and "sublime ideals." If a person does not have a lofty goal and a sublime ideal, life is often shrouded in a layer of gray gauze, losing the brilliance of life. The line written by the Tang Dynasty poet Wang Zhihuan: "To ascend another story, to see a thousand miles further," profoundly illustrates this truth. People with a rat's-eye view, who only hope to see the trivial things under their noses, why bother climbing the stairs? Only those who "want to see a thousand miles further" have the interest and perseverance to "ascend another story."
    The working class is to realize the complete liberation of all mankind. The working class of China is to build a great socialist and communist society in our country. Every conscious person should consciously dedicate all their strength to this great ideal. Therefore, conceit and arrogance are completely incompatible with the style of the working class. In the eyes of the working class, being proud of a small achievement is a manifestation of low taste. If a person is shackled by the "fetters" of "low taste," then he cannot "ascend another story." Of course, humility is not self-deprecation, because self-deprecation is a manifestation of servility, while humility is the crystallization of noble communist qualities.
    Whether a person has a spirit of humility can sometimes be measured by whether they are willing to bow their heads in the face of truth, whether they humbly listen to the opinions of others, and accept the criticism of others. People with a spirit of humility are always those who submit to the truth, dare to face their own shortcomings, and "rejoice when they hear of their faults." When the Soviet writer Ostrovsky sent the original manuscript of the first volume of "Born of the Storm" to Sholokhov for review, he wrote: "After you finish reading it, you must tell me your opinion, but tell the truth, if you don't like it, you can scold it! ... Praise can only ruin a person." (See "Ostrovsky's Speeches, Essays, and Letters," page 318, published by China Youth Publishing House) This attitude of welcoming the opinions of others is a manifestation of extreme humility.
    There is no doubt that a person with a spirit of humility will naturally not become complacent because of small achievements, and will not develop the faults of exaggeration and self-aggrandizement.
    Working selflessly, with boundless humility, turning the ideological garbage left over from the bourgeoisie, such as "pride," "conceit," and "smugness," into ashes – this is the guarantee of our cause's invincibility and the driving force to "ascend another story"!

### “欲穷千里目，更上一层楼”

　　“欲穷千里目，更上一层楼”
　　王宣
    当八十五岁的伟大的科学家牛顿临终的时候，他非常谦逊地说道：“我不知道世人对于我是怎样看法，不过我自己只是觉得好像在海滨玩耍的一个小孩子，有时很高兴的拾着一颗光滑美丽的石子，但真理的大海，我还是没有发现。”然后他又说：“如果我所见的比笛卡儿要远一点，那是因为我是站在巨人的肩上的缘故。”俄罗斯著名的寓言家克雷洛夫，当他的朋友赞扬他的书写得好，书籍销行的册数很高时，也谦卑地回答：“不，不是我的书写得好，是因为我的书是给小孩子们看的，孩子容易把书弄坏，所以版次印得多。”从这两人的话里，我们看见了一个虚怀若谷的谦逊的崇高形象。这对于我们是有多么大的教育作用呀！
    党和毛主席不断地告诉我们要谦逊。谦逊是共产主义者的一种美德，正是这种谦逊精神，引导我们继续前进。
    谦逊是“远大目的”和“崇高理想”的“大树”所结出来的甘美果实。一个人如果没有一个远大目的与崇高理想，往往便使生活蒙上一层灰暗的罩纱，失去了生命的光辉。唐代诗人王之涣所写的诗句：“欲穷千里目，更上一层楼。”便含意浑厚地说明了这个真理。鼠目寸光，只希望看见鼻尖下区区事物的人，何必要登楼呢？只有“欲穷千里目”的人，才有兴趣和毅力去“更上一层楼”。
    工人阶级是要实现全人类的彻底解放。我们中国的工人阶级是要在我国建设伟大的社会主义和共产主义社会。我们每个有觉悟的人，都应该自觉地为这个伟大的理想而献出一切力量。因此，自矜和骄傲是与工人阶级的风格完全水火不相容的。在工人阶级看来，因为某一件小小的成绩而骄傲起来，是一种低级趣味的表现。如果一个人套上了“低级趣味”的“镣铐”，那么，他就不可能“更上一层楼”了。当然，谦逊不是妄自菲薄，因为妄自菲薄是一种奴性的表现，而谦逊是崇高的共产主义品质的结晶。
    一个人是否有谦逊精神，有时也可以用是否勇于在真理面前低头，是否虚心听取他人意见，接受他人批评这把“测量器”来衡量的。具有谦逊精神的人，也总是服从真理，勇于正视自己的缺点、“闻过则喜”的人。苏联作家奥斯特洛夫斯基把“暴风雨所诞生的”第一卷原稿寄给萧洛霍夫审阅的时候，写道：“你读完之后，必须说出你的意见，但是要说诚实话，如果你不喜欢就可以骂！……夸奖，只能糟蹋一个人。”（见“奥斯特洛夫斯基演讲、论文、书信集”，318页，中国青年出版社出版）这种欢迎他人意见的态度，正是有极大的谦逊精神的表现。
    毫无疑问，一个具有谦逊精神的人，自然也就不会因为有了小小的成绩而自满起来，更不会产生浮夸和自我吹嘘的毛病了。
    忘我地工作，无比的谦逊，把资产阶级遗留下来的“骄傲”、
  “自矜”、“自鸣得意”等思想垃圾都化为灰烬——这是我们事业攻无不克，战无不胜的保证，也是“更上一层楼”的动力！
