Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 3rd: According to Baghdad newspapers today, the Iraqi Development Board has decided to terminate contracts signed with three British and American companies.

    The first company to have its contract terminated is the London firm, MacKenzie Limited, which served as the consultant and designer for the Baghdad steel plant being built by the Iraqi Development Board. This decision was made because this steel plant has already been included in the economic and technical cooperation agreement signed between Iraq and the Soviet Union. The decision stipulates that this company must hand over to the Iraqi Development Department all completed research data related to this project.

    The second company is IBRD, registered in Hong Kong, which is the consultant and designer for the Iraqi high-grade textile factory construction project. It will receive all its handling fees from the Development Department.

    The third company is the American Ebasco Services Incorporated, which is the consultant and designer for the Kirkuk-Baghdad natural gas pipeline project. This decision was made because the Development Board, based on the report of a special committee, decided not to proceed with this project at present. The special committee said that the products of the Daura and Muftiah refineries will be able to meet local fuel oil consumption needs from 1960 to 1969, so there is no need to carry out this project at present.

    伊拉克开发委员会决定
    停止执行同三家英美公司的合同
    新华社巴格达3日电　据巴格达报纸今天报道，伊拉克开发委员会决定停止执行同三家英美公司签订的合同。
    第一家被停止执行合同的公司是伦敦梅肯泽有限公司，这家公司是伊拉克开发委员会修建巴格达钢铁厂的咨询和设计者。所以作出这项决定，是由于这个钢铁厂已经包括在伊拉克和苏联签订的经济和技术合作协定中。决定规定，这家公司必须把有关这项工程的已经完成的一切研究资料交给伊拉克开发部。
    第二家公司是在香港注册的伊布康公司，这家公司是伊拉克高级纺织品工厂建设工程的咨询和设计者。它将从开发部取得它的全部手续费。
    第三家公司是美国的埃巴斯科服务公司，这家公司是基尔库克—巴格达天然气管工程的咨询和设计者。所以作出这个决定是由于开发委员会根据特别委员会的报告决定在目前不进行这项工程。特别委员会说，道拉和穆弗提亚炼油厂的产品在1960年到1969年将能满足当地的燃料油的消费需要，因此目前没有必要进行这项工程。
