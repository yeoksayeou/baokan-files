The Extremely Complex Dialect

Here is a mountainous area with a radius of more than 60 *li*. People say the phrase "What are you doing?" in many different ways: some say "Zuo He Mu," some say "Zuo Mao Nao," some say "Zuo Me Er," and some say "Zuo Mei Nei," and so on. In some families, the speech of the parents-in-law, sons and daughters-in-law, and sisters-in-law are all different. When they talk, it's like opening a speech exhibition. When production team leader Wang Lianxiang went to the county for a meeting, she could only understand two or three out of ten sentences of the responsible comrade's report. She couldn't easily understand the spirit of the meeting, and she couldn't convey it well when she returned to the team, which affected the development of production.

This mountainous area is Chakou Township in She County, Anhui Province. Due to historical conditions and traffic barriers, an extremely complex dialect has formed here, almost unique to each village. There are more than 7,000 households and more than 23,000 people here. Their local dialect is not only incomprehensible to people in the Anhui Plain, but also to people in She County, which is only dozens of *li* away. The literacy textbook with phonetic symbols compiled by the county in 1958 has 1,516 common characters, of which more than 500 have different pronunciations from the Chakou local sound. After liberation, the peasants in this remote mountainous area turned over politically and economically, and also culturally. In April 1958, it was named She County's Cultural Township. However, because they could not understand and speak Putonghua, they still felt a lot of difficulties and inconveniences in production and life. They said, "Illiteracy is being a blind man, and not being able to understand and speak Putonghua is like being half-deaf and half-dumb."

Twenty Days Changed the Face

The above is the situation before October 1958. The situation has now changed. If you go to the Chakou People's Commune, you can hear the members talking in Putonghua that everyone can understand, whether in the fields, on the mountains, or in the streets and alleys.

After the establishment of the Chakou People's Commune in October 1958, with the continuous improvement and enrichment of the masses' economic and cultural lives, and with the increasingly close connection of people's labor lives, learning Putonghua became an urgent requirement of cadres and the masses. In order to adapt to the development of the objective situation and meet the needs of the masses, the commune Party committee decided in early November 1958 to launch a campaign to learn Putonghua throughout the commune, setting off a surge of everyone learning, everyone speaking, learning everywhere, and speaking everywhere. After twenty days of effort, by late November, more than 15,800 young and middle-aged people in the commune had initially learned to speak some Putonghua, reaching 83% of the 19,100+ young and middle-aged people in the commune.

How was this achievement achieved?

Secretary Takes the Lead, Everyone Gets Involved

According to the county party committee's instructions and the needs of the masses, the commune party committee attached great importance to the work of promoting Putonghua. The secretary personally took the lead. In addition to making a special discussion and resolution at the township party committee meeting, a leading group was established. Personnel from relevant units were absorbed, and a Putonghua promotion working committee was established to formulate plans and carry out work, adopting the "four-package" method of "Party committee contracting camps, camp general branch contracting companies, company branch contracting platoons, and Party and Youth League members contracting individuals." Party and Youth League members were used as the core to cultivate a large number of activists as the backbone force in the movement, driving the entire commune members to learn, forming a vigorous learning upsurge.

Using the Abstract to Drive the Concrete, Using Points to Lead the Surface

At the beginning of the movement, the commune party committee attached importance to publicity work, using all the commune's local broadcasts, blackboards, light newspapers and other propaganda tools to publicize the political significance of promoting Putonghua to the commune members. Eye-catching slogans related to the promotion of Putonghua were written in traffic arteries and public places. A mobilization meeting of party and Youth League general branch secretaries, propaganda committee members, and activists from major brigades was convened to unify thinking and boost morale. At the same time, Chakou Brigade was taken as the focus, and achievements were first made to establish a banner, and then a Putonghua performance evaluation and comparison meeting was held. Through propaganda, debates, and example education of performance demonstrations, people's enthusiasm for learning became even greater. As long as there was an opportunity to speak, it was time to learn. Female commune member He Aiju sang the praises of the benefits of learning Putonghua, saying: "Learning Putonghua has real benefits. When you talk to people, you won't be a laughingstock."

Combining Production, Mutual Teaching and Mutual Learning

The commune party committee closely integrated the work of promoting Putonghua with production, work, and cultural learning. All meetings convened by the commune and the usual discussions of work advocated speaking Putonghua. Commune members were also encouraged to converse in Putonghua during production and daily life. In terms of learning content and methods, adhering to the principle of going from simple to complex and from less to more, first learning everyday expressions, and using them as soon as they were learned. When commune members saw farm tools when going to the fields, they also learned Putonghua by comparing them. In short, see what to learn, do what to say; teach others what you have learned yourself, everyone is a teacher, everywhere is teaching material; teach each other and learn from each other, the capable become teachers. At the same time, Putonghua was combined with vocabulary teaching in the cultural classes of party schools, red-expert schools, and spare-time schools.

In order to comprehensively carry out the work of promoting Putonghua, forty-eight Putonghua promotion stations were also set up in public places. All cadres, students, teachers, and shop staff in the commune served as promoters; when promoters taught the masses to learn Putonghua, they not only took responsibility for teaching, learning, and time, but also seized every opportunity and found all relationships to teach. In addition to teaching their parents, elementary school students also used their spare time to set up fifty-seven inquiry stations at the entrances of major traffic arteries throughout the commune, teaching Putonghua in an inquiring tone and questioning manner. Shop assistants also used Putonghua to communicate with customers. Whether at home or in the team, cadres included checking Putonghua work as one of their tasks, and mobilized the broad masses to supervise and check each other. (Attached picture)

    岔口人民公社推广普通话前后
    安教
    极为复杂的方言
    这里是一个方圆六十多里范围的山区，人们说“作什么”一句话，就有说成“作何姆”的，也有说成“作毛闹”的，更有说“作么二”的，或是说成“作梅内”的，等等。有的家庭，公婆、子媳、妯娌之间的语音也都不同，一谈起话来，像开语音展览会。生产队长王莲香到县里开会，听负责同志的报告，十句话只能听懂两三句，不容易领会会议精神，回到队里不能很好地传达，影响生产的开展。
    这个山区就是安徽省歙县岔口乡。这里由于历史条件和交通的阻隔，形成了极为复杂的方言，几乎一个村子一个样子。这里有七千多户，二万三千多人，他们的土话不仅安徽平原地区的人听不懂，就连相隔几十里地的歙县城里的人也听不懂。1958年县里编的扫盲同音识字课本，有一千五百一十六个常用字，其中与岔口地方音不同的字，就有五百多个。解放以后，这个偏僻山区的农民在政治、经济上翻了身，也在文化上翻了身。1958年4月，这里被评为歙县的文化乡。可是他们由于听不懂和不会说普通话，在生产和生活方面仍然感到很多的困难和不便。他们说：“不识字是睁眼瞎子，听不懂和不会说普通话，等于半聋子和半哑巴。”
    二十天改变了面貌
    上面所说的是1958年10月以前的情况。现在的情况已经变了。你要到了岔口人民公社，无论在田间、山上或街头巷尾，都可以听到社员们用大家都听得懂的普通话进行交谈了。
    1958年10月，岔口人民公社成立以后，随着群众的经济生活和文化生活的不断提高和丰富，随着人们劳动生活联系的日益密切，学习普通话就成为干部和群众的迫切要求。公社党委为了适应客观形势的发展和满足群众的需要，在1958年11月上旬决定在全社开展一次学习普通话的运动，掀起了人人学、人人讲、到处学、到处讲的热潮。经过二十天的努力，到11月下旬，全社就有青壮年一万五千八百多人初步学会说一些普通话，达到全社青壮年一万九千一百多人中的83％。
    这个成绩是怎样取得的呢？
    书记挂帅，全民动手
    公社党委根据县委指示和群众需要，对推广普通话工作非常重视，由书记亲自挂帅，除在乡党委会上专门讨论作出决议外，又成立了领导小组，并吸收有关单位人员，建立了推广普通话工作委员会，制订计划，开展工作，采用“党委包营，营总支包连，连支部包排，党、团员包人”的“四包”办法。并以党、团员为核心，培养大批积极分子作为运动中的骨干力量，带动全体社员学习，形成了轰轰烈烈的学习热潮。
    以虚带实，以点带面
    运动一开始，社党委就重视了宣传工作，利用社里所有的土广播、黑板报、灯光报等宣传工具，把推广普通话的政治意义向社员进行宣传。在交通要道和公共场所都写着醒目的有关推广普通话的标语。又召开了各大队党、团总支书记、宣传委员和积极分子的誓师大会，统一思想，鼓足干劲。同时以岔口大队为重点，先作出成绩，树立旗帜，然后召开普通话表演评比大会。通过宣传、辩论和表演示范的实例教育，人们学习的劲头更大了，只要有说话的机会，都是学习的时间。女社员何爱菊歌颂学习普通话的好处道：“学会普通话，好处真正大，与人去交谈，不会闹笑话。”结合生产，互教互学
    公社党委把推广普通话的工作紧密地与生产、工作、学文化结合进行。凡公社召开的各项会议以及平时谈工作都提倡讲普通话。社员在生产时和日常生活中，也提倡用普通话交谈。在学习内容和方法上，本着从简到繁、由少到多的原则，首先学习日常生活用语，学了就用。社员在下地时看到农具也对比着学普通话。总之，见什么，学什么，做什么，讲什么；自己学会了就教别人，人人是教师，处处是教材；互教互学，能者为师。同时在党校、红专学校、业余学校的文化课上都结合词语教学普通话。
    为了使推广普通话的工作全面开展，还在公共场所设立了普通话推广站四十八个。全社所有干部、学生、教师、商店工作人员都当了推广员；推广员在教群众学习普通话时，不仅包教、包学、包时间，而且抓一切机会、找一切关系去教。小学生们除了要教会自己的家长外，还利用课余时间，在全社各地交通要道口，设立了请问站五十七个，以请问口气、问话方式来教普通话。商店售货员也做到用普通话和顾客交谈。干部无论在家或下队，都把检查普通话工作列为工作之一，并发动广大群众，互相督促，互相检查。（附图片）
