Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th. The inaugural meeting of the Soviet Union Sports Associations and Sports Organizations Federation victoriously concluded here on the 18th, after two days. More than 500 representatives from sports groups, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations from all over the Soviet Union attended the meeting. The meeting listened to the report of Romanov, chairman of the preparatory organization committee of the Federation, and elected the leading body of the Federation. Many famous athletes were elected as members of the Central Council.

In his report, Romanov summarized the brilliant achievements of Soviet sports in recent years and put forward tasks for future development.

He said that at present, 190,000 sports groups have been established in enterprises, farms, government organs, and schools throughout the Soviet Union, three times the number in 1940. These groups have 20.3 million athletes. In addition, a large number of sports enthusiasts are exercising in gymnastics, travel, hunting, fishing, skating, skiing, and other sports. With the care of the Party and the government, a large number of sports experts have emerged in the mass sports activities.

Romanov said that in the past decade, Soviet athletes have broken national records more than 4,000 times, including 695 world records. In 1958 alone, Soviet athletes won 400 gold, silver, and bronze medals in 45 world and European championships. The Soviet Union has reached an excellent international level in sports such as track and field, skating, cycling, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting. In 1948, the Soviet Union accounted for only 18 of the world records in the above-mentioned sports, and the United States accounted for 56. At present, out of 178 official world records, 81 belong to the Soviet Union, and only 52 to the United States. In the next seven years, the Soviet Union will train 17 million graded athletes, of which more than 30,000 will be sports masters.

Romanov pointed out that in the future, sports must be further integrated into the lives of the Soviet people, especially the Soviet youth. In the next seven years, the number of Soviet athletes will increase to 50 million, which is one and a half times more than the current number. In the next two years, sports organizations will be established in all enterprises and government organs with about 150 to 200 employees. Joint sports groups will be organized in enterprises and government organs with fewer employees. The Prepared for Labor and Defense system will be further developed in the future, and every young person of the appropriate age should be able to obtain a Prepared for Labor and Defense medal. Romanov said that rural sports organizations in the Soviet Union have doubled in the past decade, with 4.6 million athletes. In the next few years, the number of rural athletes will increase to 12 million to 15 million, and the results of some basic sports of rural athletes should be improved to the level of urban sports groups.

Romanov pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of athletes in the future. International sports contacts will also be further strengthened.

In his report, Romanov criticized the bourgeois sports workers who used the excuse of "sports is not related to politics" in international sports organizations to carry out conspiracies such as "two Chinas." The reporter also condemned the wrong attitude of the International Olympic Committee towards the German Democratic Republic and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

After the report, the conference held discussions. The speakers unanimously believed that in the future, sports work must go deep into people's lives and vigorously develop mass sports activities. Then the conference passed a resolution on the report.

The conference also listened to the report of Postnikov, vice chairman of the organizational department of the Soviet Sports Associations and Sports Organizations Federation, on the charter of the Federation, and passed the corresponding resolution.

The conference elected 137 members of the leading body of the Central Council of the Federation. Romanov was elected chairman of the Central Council. The vice chairmen are Postnikov, Valuyev, Pislyak, Beman, secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League, and Shevchenko, secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.

In addition, many famous athletes were elected as directors, including world chess champion Botvinnik, Zhu Kaling, the all-around champion of men's gymnastics at the 16th Olympic Games, Kuz, the world record creator of the 5,000 and 10,000-meter races, Bestrova, the world record creator of women's pentathlon, and other famous Soviet athletes Kolechin, Klepkina, etc.

　　增强人民体质　建设共产主义
　　苏联大力展开群众性体育运动
　　苏联体育协会和体育组织联合会正式成立
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联体育协会和体育组织联合会成立大会17日和18日在这里举行了两天后胜利闭幕。出席大会的有来自全苏各地的体育团体、工会和共青团组织的五百多名代表。会议听取了这个联合会筹备组织委员会主席罗曼诺夫的报告，并选出了联合会的领导机构，许多著名运动员当选为中央理事会理事。
    罗曼诺夫在报告中总结了苏联体育在最近几年中所取得的辉煌成就，并提出了关于今后发展的任务。
    他说，目前苏联各地企业、农庄、机关以及学校已经建立了十九万个体育团体，这一数字为1940年的三倍。这些团体拥有二千零三十万运动员。此外，还有大批体育爱好者自己在进行体操、旅行、打猎、钓鱼、滑冰、滑雪等运动项目的锻炼，在党和政府关怀下开展的群众性体育运动中，出现了大批体育运动能手。
    罗曼诺夫说，最近十年来，苏联运动员有四千多次刷新了全苏纪录，其中有六百九十五次打破世界纪录。仅在1958年内，苏联运动员在四十五次世界和欧洲锦标赛中获得了四百个金质、银质和铜质奖章。苏联在田径、滑冰、自行车、射击，游泳和举重等运动中都达到了国际优秀水平。1948年上述项目的世界纪录苏联只占有十八个，美国占有五十六个。而目前，在一百七十八个世界正式纪录中，有八十一个属于苏联，美国只有五十二个。在今后七年中，苏联将培养出一千七百万等级运动员，其中将有三万多个运动健将。
    罗曼诺夫指出，今后必须进一步使体育运动深入到苏联人民、特别是苏联青年人的生活中。在今后七年中，苏联运动员要增加到五千万人，即比目前多一倍半。最近两年内，凡是拥有职工一百五十至二百人左右的企业和机关，都要成立体育组织。在职工人数较少的企业和机关中将组织联合体育团体。劳卫制今后要进一步展开，应该使每一适龄的青年都能获得劳卫制奖章。罗曼诺夫说，苏联的农村体育组织在最近十年来增加了一倍，运动员达到四百六十万人。今后几年中，农村运动员要增加到一千二百万至一千五百万人，并且要把农村运动员的一些基本运动项目的成绩提高到城市体育团体的水平。
    罗曼诺夫指出，今后必须加强对运动员的思想教育工作。国际体育联系也将进一步加强。
    罗曼诺夫在报告中批评了那些在国际体育组织中借口“体育与政治无关”来进行“两个中国”等阴谋的资产阶级体育工作者。报告人还谴责了国际奥林匹克运动委员会对德意志民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的错误态度。
    报告结束后，大会进行了讨论。发言者一致认为今后体育运动工作必需深入人民生活和大力开展群众性体育运动。接着大会通过了关于这个报告的决议。
    大会还听取了苏联体育协会和体育组织联合会组织部副主席波斯特尼科夫关于联合会会章的报告，并且通过了相应的决议。
    大会选出了联合会中央理事会领导机构一百三十七人。罗曼诺夫当选为中央理事会主席。副主席是波斯特尼科夫、瓦柳耶夫、彼斯利亚克、苏联共青团中央书记别曼和全苏工会中央理事会书记谢夫钦科。
    此外，很多著名的运动员被选为理事，其中包括，世界象棋冠军波特维尼克、第十六届奥运会男子体操全能冠军朱卡林、五千和一万公尺赛跑的世界纪录创造者库兹、女子五项运动世界纪录创造者贝斯特罗娃和其他苏联著名运动员科勒钦、克列普金娜等。
