Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest. Romanian agricultural workers have launched a spring plowing and sowing campaign across the country. Soil improvement, water conservancy construction, and afforestation work have also been launched nationwide.

Romania's spring plowing area this year reaches 2.2 million hectares, and the spring sowing area reaches 6.4 million hectares. Among them, the corn sowing area is 3.8 million hectares, sunflowers are 500,000 hectares, and sugar beets are 180,000 hectares. Due to the lack of rain and snow last winter and this spring, various regions have taken timely measures since the beginning of spring to ensure continued grain production increases this year. For example, in the first quarter alone, the state supplied collective farms and individual farmers with 25,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, 340 water pumps, 24,000 various animal-drawn plows, and other large quantities of machinery and farm tools. What is different this year compared to the past is that farmers are applying large amounts of natural fertilizers during spring sowing, with the amount reaching 15 million tons.

In order to increase grain production, the soil improvement and water conservancy projects carried out in Romania this year are very large-scale. This year, the country will improve a total of 370,000 hectares of land, and make 80,000 hectares of it irrigable land. The funds allocated by the state for these areas are almost four times that of last year. At present, hundreds of dikes, drainage, and irrigation projects are under construction across the country, and the masses are enthusiastically and actively participating in voluntary labor. The completion of these projects will require the excavation of 40 million cubic meters of earth, which is more than six times the engineering of last year. It is estimated that this year, through land reclamation, flood prevention, and drainage work, the country can increase arable land by more than 500,000 hectares, and produce approximately 1.25 million tons more grain.

March is Romania's annual mass afforestation month. According to the national afforestation task of completing more than 762,000 hectares from 1956 to 1965 proposed by the Council of Ministers, this year the country will afforest nearly 80,000 hectares, and carry out forest land consolidation and other work on 165,000 hectares of forests. This year, in addition to 55,000 professional forestry workers, a large number of people, especially young people, are participating in voluntary afforestation activities. (Attached picture)

### 力争大丰产　春耕春播忙  各地大规模兴修水利改良土壤

    力争大丰产　春耕春播忙
    各地大规模兴修水利改良土壤
    新华社布加勒斯特电  罗马尼亚农业劳动者已经在全国范围内掀起了春耕春播热潮。改良土壤、兴修水利和植树造林的工作也已在国内开展。
    罗马尼亚今年的春耕面积达二百二十万公顷，春播面积达六百四十万公顷。其中玉蜀黍播种面积为三百八十万公顷，向日葵为五十万公顷，甜菜为十八万公顷。由于去冬今春雨雪少，开春以来，各地都及时地采取了各种措施，以保证今年粮食继续增产。例如，仅第一季度，国家就向集体农庄和个体农民供应了二万五千吨化学肥料、三百四十个水泵、二万四千个各种兽力犁，以及其它大量的机器和农具。今年和过去不同的是，农民在春播中大量施用天然肥料，其数量将达到一千五百万吨。
    为增加粮食生产，罗马尼亚今年所进行的改良土壤和兴修水利的工程十分浩大。今年全国将共改良三十七万公顷的土地，并使其中的八万公顷成为可灌溉地。国家为这些方面拨出的款项差不多等于去年的四倍。目前，全国有成百个堤坝、排涝和灌溉工程正在施工，各地的群众热烈和积极地参加义务劳动。完成这些工程将要挖掘四千万公方的泥土，相当于去年工程的六倍多。预计，今年通过开荒、防涝和排涝等工作，可以使全国增加五十万公顷以上的可耕地，可以多生产大约一百二十五万吨的粮食。
    3月是罗马尼亚一年一度的群众性的植树造林月。根据部长会议提出的全国在1956—1965年完成七十六万二千多公顷的造林任务，今年全国要造林近八万公顷，并且对十六万五千公顷的森林进行林地整理等工作。今年除五万五千名专业的造林工人外，还有大批的群众尤其是青少年参加义务造林活动。（附图片）
