Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 29th - The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Ceylon, Pieter Keuneman, published an article in the "Daily Sun" on the 27th, refuting the nonsense that "China intends to attack Buddhism" regarding the Tibetan rebellion. He said, "A small number of wealthy lamas participated in the recent rebellion, but this rebellion was not to defend Buddhism."

The article stated: "Many foreigners, including Ceylonese Buddhists who have returned from visits to China, unanimously believe that the current Chinese government has facilitated the spread of Buddhism throughout China—including Tibet. The Chinese government has spent large sums of money to repair Buddhist temples that fell into disrepair during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, who favored foreign Christian missionaries, restoring them to their original state."

The article also cited the example of Professor Malalasekera, former Chairman of the All-Ceylon Buddhist Congress, who is currently giving a series of lectures on Buddhist issues in Beijing, illustrating that China allows the free dissemination of Buddhism.

Keuneman said that the small number of lamas who participated in the Tibetan rebellion were more like landlords than monks. They owned more than one-third of the land in Tibet. They treated the serfs who worked for them as slaves. Apart from not being able to kill them, the lamas had the right to do whatever they wanted with them. The lamas who participated in the rebellion were not protecting Buddhism, but protecting their rights as slave owners and landlords.

Keuneman asked: "Some monks in Ceylon openly fight against the Paddy Lands Act. Is this a struggle to defend Buddhism?"

Keuneman also refuted the lie that the Tibetan rebellion was a "national movement for freedom." He said: Tibet has been a part of China since ancient times. The Tibetan incident is not an event between two countries, but China's internal affair.

Keuneman said, "The main leaders of the Tibetan rebellion are a small group composed of feudal elements, serf owners, slave owners, and wealthy lamas. They fear that economic and social reforms in Tibet will threaten their status."

Keuneman said: "The rebellion ended in a few days, which shows that the public does not support the rebellion." Keuneman also refuted the slander that the Chinese central government would use force to implement socialist reforms in Tibet. He said that the Chinese central government does not intend to do so.

    锡共总书记严正指出
    西藏事件是中国内政
    所谓中国进攻佛教纯系胡言
    新华社科伦坡29日电　锡兰共产党总书记彼得·克尼曼在27日“每日太阳报”上发表文章，就西藏叛乱事件驳斥了所谓“中国企图进攻佛教”的胡说。他说，“少数有钱的喇嘛参加了最近的叛乱，但是这场叛乱不是保卫佛教的叛乱。”
    文章说：“许多外国人，包括访问中国归来的锡兰佛教徒都一致认为，中国现政府为佛教在中国各地——包括西藏——的传播提供了便利。中国政府用了大笔款项来修缮在偏爱外国基督教传教士的蒋介石统治时期倾颓的佛教寺庙，使之恢复原样。”
    文章还举出前锡兰全国佛教大会主席马拉拉塞克拉教授目前正在北京就佛教问题作一系列的讲学的实例说明中国允许自由传播佛教。
    克尼曼说，参加西藏叛乱的少数喇嘛，与其说他们是僧侣，不如说他们是地主。拥有全西藏三分之一以上土地的正是他们。他们把为他们工作的农奴当作奴隶，除了不能杀农奴之外，喇嘛有权对他们为所欲为。参加叛乱的喇嘛不是为了保护佛教，而是为了保护他们作为奴隶主和地主的权利。
    克尼曼问道：“锡兰有些和尚公开为反对稻田法而斗争。难道这是保卫佛教的斗争吗？”
    克尼曼还驳斥了把西藏叛乱说成是
  “争取自由的民族运动”的谎言。他说：西藏自古以来一直是中国的一部分。西藏事件不是两国之间发生的事件，而是中国的内政。
    克尼曼说，“西藏叛乱的主要领袖是封建分子、农奴主、奴隶主和有钱的喇嘛构成的小集团。他们害怕西藏的经济和社会改革威胁他们的地位。”
    克尼曼说：“叛乱在几天内就结束了，这表明公众不支持叛乱”。克尼曼还驳斥了中国中央政府要用武力在西藏实施社会主义改革的谰言。他说，中国中央政府并不打算这样做。
