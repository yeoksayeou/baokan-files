Plant Protection
Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

The word "protection" in the Eight-Character Charter for Agricultural Production Increase means protecting crops from various pests, pathogens, parasitic nematodes, birds, beasts, and weeds (in a broad sense, it should also include the impact of other adverse conditions), ensuring normal crop growth, and achieving a bumper harvest. Therefore, plant protection work must be implemented throughout the entire growing season of crops, from sowing to harvest. It must be closely integrated with various agricultural activities and, at certain times, become a crucial measure.

Last Year's Important Achievements

In 1958, on the plant protection front, due to the implementation of the Party's general line for building socialism, a mass movement to eliminate pests and diseases on a large scale was universally launched, achieving brilliant results and writing a glorious page in the history of plant protection in our country.

Using a Combination of Agricultural Techniques and Chemical Control to Eliminate Pests and Diseases

The area of pest and disease control nationwide in 1958 expanded by 1.6 times compared to 1957.

Across the country, in fourteen provinces (autonomous regions), 173 counties (cities) basically eliminated rice stem borer damage. For example, in Xiaogan Prefecture, Hubei, the borer damage rate was reduced from 18% in previous years to below 1%. The rice stem borer damage rate in Jiangsu Province also decreased from 6.5% in 1957 to around 1%. In Yizhang County, Hunan, rice planthoppers and leafhoppers caused serious damage in 1957, resulting in a loss of approximately 14.8 million catties of rice. In 1958, by adopting measures such as combining overwintering control with field control, and combining weeding with spraying, over 90% of the rice planthoppers and leafhoppers were basically eliminated. In major cotton-growing areas, by implementing the technical strategy of large-scale, concentrated, contiguous, short-term, and thorough elimination of cotton pests, as well as organizing joint prevention zones, strengthening prediction and forecasting, seizing crucial periods, and conducting a first elimination and a second mopping-up campaign to eliminate cotton aphid damage; controlling bollworm damage during the budding and boll-forming stage, and protecting cotton buds and bolls, the shedding rate due to insect pests was reduced to below 5% in some areas, such as Xinxiang, Henan, and Gaotang, Shandong.

Jin Southeast Prefecture, Shanxi Province, based on the characteristics of corn borers overwintering in the roots, stalks, and cob axes of miscellaneous grains, and concentrating their damage to corn heart leaves during the corn growing season, launched a mass movement to treat roots, stalks, and cob axes, combined with applying pesticides during the heart leaf stage for protection. Over two million mu of corn in the entire prefecture basically achieved "no empty leaves, no insect holes in stems, no wind-broken tassels," ensuring a bumper corn harvest. Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, also achieved great results in preventing corn borer damage by launching a mass movement to treat roots, stalks, and other materials.

Regarding diseases, climatic conditions in many areas in 1958 made it easy for several major wheat diseases to occur. Severe stem rust occurred extensively in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Inner Mongolia. In Shaanxi Province, due to the relatively warm winter, which favored the overwintering of pathogens, coupled with frequent spring rains, stripe rust was quite rampant. Along the Yangtze River, due to high spring temperatures and continuous overcast and rainy weather, wheat rust and scab began to occur in late April and developed rapidly, causing a large-scale epidemic. Under the leadership of the Party, farmers and scientific workers in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces launched a nationwide campaign to chemically control rust on over 70 million mu of wheat fields, using lime-sulfur mixture on a large scale. In the face of insufficient chemical supply, the masses contributed ideas and researched the use of more than 30 kinds of native pesticides, such as cat's eyes, sorrel, and red smartweed, to effectively control wheat stem rust. Native pesticides accounted for 38.7% of the total treated area. The emergence of this miracle completely defeated the view that pesticides could not control rust on a large scale and the view that relied solely on disease-resistant varieties. Moreover, it solved the problem of insufficient chemical pesticides, innovated rust control technology, and created conditions for large-scale control of crop diseases.

Using a Combination of Eliminating Sources of Infection and Universal Chemical Treatment to Eliminate Various Crop Diseases

The Jiangxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences confirmed that diseased seeds are the primary source of infection for rice bacterial blight and developed an effective integrated control method based on disinfecting seeds with acidic mercuric chloride solution. After this method was promoted and applied in Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, which had been severely affected by the disease in previous years, the county basically eliminated this disease.

Rice blast is widespread in both northern and southern rice-growing areas. It is more serious in the north, and it is gradually becoming more severe in areas where japonica rice is being expanded in the south. According to research results from various regions, as long as three key points are emphasized: ① treating diseased grass, disinfecting seeds, and eliminating sources of infection; ② strengthening cultivation management, selecting disease-resistant varieties, and applying fertilizer rationally; ③ spraying in the field and eliminating disease centers, this disease can be effectively controlled. In the Bohai Sea rice area, the white panicle rate has been reduced from 14% to 3%-8%. The Shangyou People's Commune in the suburbs of Fushun City also carried out aerial spraying to control rice blast, achieving excellent results of safety, pesticide saving, labor saving, and high effectiveness, creating experience in applying aircraft to control rice blast. According to the experience of Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu and other provinces, it has also been proven that comprehensive measures such as eliminating sources of pathogens, strengthening cultivation management, improving plant resistance, and spraying for protection have good disease control effects.

Based on the occurrence and epidemic patterns of potato late blight in the Jin North potato-producing area, especially targeting the initial occurrence of central disease plants, the technical strategy of "mass inspection, extinguishing wherever it is found, encircling layer by layer, and strictly blockading" was adopted, implementing technical measures that combined eliminating sources of infection with universal chemical treatment. The area of more than one million mu, which was universally affected in the past, has been compressed to less than 100,000 mu, and the area withered by the disease is less than 0.1%. The current task is to further research and find methods to disinfect diseased seed potatoes in order to achieve better and more economical results.

Wheat bunt and stinking smut, which are infected by manure, have special control effects when seeds are mixed with hexachlorobenzene and pentachloronitrobenzene. The control effect for stinking smut, which is doubly transmitted by seed manure, can reach 70%-90%. The control effect on loose smut reaches 60%-85%. Applying seed mixing as soil treatment can completely eliminate stinking smut, and the effect of eliminating loose smut can be increased to 90%-99%. After this measure is fully promoted, it can completely eliminate these two serious wheat diseases throughout the country.

Seedling diseases that affect the early development of cotton seedlings are one of the main causes of third-class seedlings. In 1958, the large-scale seed treatment was summarized, affirming the use of a mixed agent of pentachloronitrobenzene and Xilixing to mix with soil and cover seeds, combined with early and mid-cultivation and soil loosening and thinning, and spraying with Bordeaux mixture or copper sulfate solution for prevention if necessary according to the disease, as effective measures to obtain strong seedlings. The use of antibiotic "G4" to control Verticillium wilt in large areas of cotton fields, and the selection of wilt-resistant varieties, such as 147, 24-21, 523-42, etc., have played a certain role in production practice.

Using Chemical Poisoning and Investigating the Life Cycle of Pests to Kill Them

In terms of eliminating pests, the Institute of Plant Protection of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences created a method of treating soil with pesticides to eliminate wheat blossom midges, which was demonstrated on a large area in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan, and achieved good results. This method has many advantages over the method of controlling wheat blossom midge adults with 666 powder: ① It can eliminate the larvae that have been diapausing in the soil for years, providing effective conditions for eradicating wheat blossom midges; ② It also controls underground pests such as grubs, wireworms, and mole crickets; ③ It overcomes the shortcomings that pesticides cannot be sprayed due to rain during the adult emergence period and that it is difficult to spray densely planted wheat plants; ④ It simplifies the forecasting procedures.

Regarding the locust plagues left over from the old society, locusts are no longer a disaster because the technology of reconnaissance of locust situations and the favorable time to eliminate young hoppers have been generally mastered. In some areas, the locust density in 1958 was reduced to the point where no residual locusts could be found in 100 mu.

Agricultural scientific research institutions in Northeast China have researched and developed the application of 20% pure gamma-BHC powder to mix with seeds to control oil crops and beet seedling pests, which has yielded results. In Yushu, Yongji, and Kaitong, Jilin Province, after soybean, sunflower, castor bean, beet, and other crops were treated with seed mixing, the effect of eliminating scarab beetle damage during the seedling stage was almost 100%.

Various research institutions conducted a comprehensive survey of overwintering cotton pests in the winter of 1958. The last generation (fourth generation) of cotton bollworms in 1958 was rampant in the northern cotton-growing areas. The Henan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences surveyed the number of eggs (worms) per 100 plants at that time, which was more than ten times that of the same generation in previous years. Although vigorous prevention and control were carried out, there were still many overwintering pupae left in the cotton fields that had not been completely eliminated. According to sampling inspections of 160 cotton fields in Henan Province, there were an average of 6,666 pupae per mu, and the base number was significantly increased compared with previous years. This fact provided data for predicting the occurrence of the first generation of cotton pests in early spring 1959.

Others, such as the deputy township head of Puzhao Township, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang, carefully observed the characteristics of flowers damaged by pink bollworms, found a method to pick insect-infested flower caps with an accuracy rate of 90%, and improved the efficiency of insect catching by one time. The Hubei Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences used black green small bees to control overwintering pink bollworms in warehouses, and the Guangdong Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences used trapping plants to control mole crickets, which played a good role in research work or production.

In terms of prediction and forecasting, the general laws of occurrence of major pests and diseases have been preliminarily grasped, the accuracy of prediction and forecasting has been improved, and a large number of commune members have been trained as informants, and mass general investigations have been carried out, which has the conditions to grasp the favorable timing for eliminating pests and diseases.

In terms of plant quarantine, 2.8 billion catties of various seeds and more than 51.5 million seedlings transported from various places were quarantined and inspected in 1958, and more than 1.53 million mu of disease-free seed land and 414 nurseries were established, effectively preventing the spread of dangerous pests and diseases. The Plant Quarantine Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture researched and developed measures to eliminate grape phylloxera on grape cuttings using a 666 immersion method, which is not only simple and easy to implement, and the effect is indeed reliable, but also has no adverse effect on cutting germination, but rather has a stimulating growth effect. For cotton aphids on apple roots, the application of paradichlorobenzene outside the crown can achieve a 100% kill rate for cotton aphids at a depth of one foot.

Widely Producing Native Pesticides to Create Conditions for Eliminating Pests and Diseases

In terms of pesticides, research units, schools, and factories across the country have extensively carried out research work. New pesticides with application value, such as insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, and plant stimulants, have been synthesized and researched, and the varieties that have been put into production account for 17%. The varieties that have been researched and can be put into production account for 44.6%. In the past year, there has been a leap forward in solving the research on emulsifiers needed for current pesticide processing, and new types of emulsifiers with simple manufacturing methods and low prices have been obtained. The emulsions of pesticides such as 1059 and 1605 have exceeded the emulsifiers produced by the German Bayer factory in terms of both quality and efficacy, reaching a certain level. In addition, the preparation of DDT soil paste and colloidal sulfur by simple methods has also achieved good results.

The most outstanding point in pesticides last year was that through mass creation, full use was made of plant, animal, mineral, and industrial by-product resources for experimentation and promotion. According to statistics, more than 500 kinds of native pesticides were excavated across the country, and 1.47 million native pesticide factories were established. The amount used reached 16 million tons. According to incomplete statistics from six provinces (autonomous regions), Jiangsu, Yunnan, Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, 79 kinds of effective native pesticides for controlling cotton aphids, spider mites, beet armyworms, and mole crickets, and 37 kinds of effective native pesticides for controlling cotton diseases have been identified for application to cotton pests and diseases, which has pointed out a new direction for pesticide research in our country. For example, extracting tomatine from tomato leaves to control wheat rust and scab, and using pomegranate peel powder to control cabbage soft rot, have excellent effects and scientific value.

The above examples are only a part of the achievements in plant protection research. But it is enough to show that we have begun to break away from the shackles of foreign dogmas and are marching on the road of socialist scientific research.

Combined with Other Measures

Plant protection must be closely integrated with other agricultural production increase measures. Neglecting any of them will not give full play to the role of protection itself. For example, the eggs, larvae, pupae, and even some adults of many crop pests, many plant pathogens, and most weed seeds are hidden in the soil. Deep plowing can bury these pests and pathogens deep underground, or turn them to the upper layer to increase their mortality rate, and can also cut off grass roots and reduce weed germination. Treating the soil with physical or chemical methods can prevent many pests and diseases. In terms of the relationship with fertilizers, wheat stinking smut pathogens can often be brought into the soil by farm manure, causing disease. Combining with manure accumulation, using weeds or plant residues and fallen leaves to compost, can kill pathogens and pests. Applying antibiotic fertilizers can inhibit the growth of many soil pathogens. In addition, applying rationally proportioned nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium topdressing at the appropriate time can enhance crop resistance to certain diseases. For example, excessive or uneven application of nitrogen fertilizer in paddy fields can weaken plant growth and reduce disease resistance, making it easy to get rice blast. Improper irrigation can also cause the growth of some diseases. Poor drainage during the cotton seedling stage and high humidity in cotton fields will increase the development of diseases. And winter irrigation of cotton fields can promote the death of Verticillium wilt pathogens in the soil. Rice blast often occurs severely in water-deficient paddy fields. As for "seed," its relationship with pest and disease control is even more obvious. The diseases and pests of many crops are spread through seeds. Physical and mechanical methods can select nematode-infested grains mixed in wheat seeds, and warm water soaking can control wheat loose smut and many other diseases. Seed mixing with pesticides can directly kill pathogens attached to the seed surface. Some seeds treated with pesticides can also prevent some seedling pathogens and pests in the soil after being sown in the soil. Due to the different characteristics of crop varieties themselves, those with strong resistance to diseases and pests can even be immune, fundamentally preventing or reducing the damage of certain diseases and pests. For example, No. 2419 wheat can resist wheat blossom midge, and some rust-resistant varieties can resist rust. Dense planting can change the conditions for the occurrence and development of crop diseases and pests. In densely planted fields, plants are tall and dense, and ventilation and light transmission conditions are poor, which is conducive to the occurrence of diseases and pests. At the same time, the field is sealed early, and it is inconvenient to use machinery, causing difficulties in prevention and control. Our task is to create a set of effective and feasible measures to prevent and control diseases and pests under the conditions of dense planting. The relationship between "protection" and "tools" is even closer. In addition to insecticidal and bactericidal pesticides, there must be appropriate equipment and pesticide application tools, such as various high-efficiency spraying and dusting machines. Finally, speaking of "management." Plant protection itself is actually an important part of crop field management work, such as cultivating, cultivating soil, irrigating, topdressing, maintaining field cleanliness, treating residual branches and fallen leaves, removing diseased plants, and cotton pruning, topping, etc. If carried out properly, they can all play an active protective role.

Five Comprehensive Measures

The comprehensive measures for plant protection should include the following aspects:

The first is measures in terms of agricultural production organization, such as formulating reasonable field planning, crop allocation, crop rotation, irrigation and drainage systems, and the introduction of resistant varieties, etc., all belong to this aspect.

The second is measures in terms of agricultural technology, such as paying attention to improving the conditions for crop growth and development from cultivation, land preparation, timely sowing, irrigation, fertilization, field management, and the treatment of post-harvest plant residues, maintaining field cleanliness, etc., so that this environmental condition is unfavorable to the occurrence and development of diseases and pests.

The third is special preventive measures, such as using various methods to treat the overwintering hosts of diseases and insects, eliminating weeds in and around the fields, especially seed treatment, are effective preventive measures. Generally, the places where diseases and insects are hidden include soil, seeds, roots, stalks, weeds, warehouses, and woody host plants, etc. Seizing favorable opportunities and using effective methods to eliminate these hidden nests of diseases and insects can greatly reduce their occurrence and damage, and achieve twice the result with half the effort.

The fourth aspect belongs to the direct annihilation measures. It is necessary to clarify the transmission routes, living habits, damage conditions, and occurrence laws of various diseases and pests, and use various effective methods to eliminate pests and pathogens that have begun to reproduce or reproduce in large quantities. These methods include mechanical and physical (such as selecting insect galls, light trapping moths, warm water soaking seeds, low-temperature insect killing, etc.), chemical (using various native and foreign pesticides to treat seeds and soil and spraying powder and spraying, etc.) and biological (using natural enemies of pests and antibiotic bacteria), etc.

Finally, there are quarantine measures, which are to determine quarantine objects based on the results of investigation and research, delineate epidemic areas and protected areas, formulate quarantine systems and specific quarantine methods, effectively prevent the spread of dangerous diseases, insects, weeds, etc. at home and abroad, and gradually eliminate their damage.

The above basic five aspects are closely coordinated with each other in specific implementation. In a certain area or a certain stage of crop growth, one aspect may be emphasized, but as a set of general comprehensive measures, one cannot simply grasp one aspect and ignore the cooperation of other aspects. Only by using comprehensive measures can we better and more thoroughly control and gradually eliminate its damage, and can we protect the healthy growth of crops from all aspects throughout the entire crop growth process in order to obtain more yield.

Must Pay Attention to Strategy

To do a good job in plant protection, we must pay attention to the strategy of preventing and controlling diseases and pests. An important experience on the plant protection front in 1958 was to grasp the enemy situation, seize the key, combine native and foreign methods, and attack fiercely and skillfully. Only in this way can we eliminate diseases and pests more, faster, better, and more economically. The general requirements for prevention and control strategies are to be accurate, ruthless, and skillful in prevention and control. To be accurate, it is necessary to clarify the general laws of diseases and pests, especially the special laws and damage characteristics of each disease and insect, and there should be accurate and timely prediction and forecasting as the foundation. Ruthless means that it is required to be both comprehensive and thorough, and to continuously improve the quality of prevention and control and expand the area and scale of prevention and control. Skillful prevention and control means effective technical methods are required. Especially in the case of insufficient pesticides, machinery, and labor this year, "skill" is even more important.

From the current point of view, plant protection work is still a weak link in the Eight-Character Charter for Agricultural Production Increase. The temperature was higher last winter and this spring, the base number of overwintering diseases and insects is larger, the mortality rate is low, and the activity is earlier. In addition to raising vigilance and paying attention to its development trend, it is also necessary to earnestly prepare for pesticide and machinery work. To prevent and control skillfully, save labor, and improve efficiency, it is not enough to rely solely on pesticides, and the focused, economical, and reasonable use of appropriate pesticides is one of the effective methods. In addition to continuing to create and produce chemical pesticides, we must implement the policy of combining native and foreign methods, mobilize the masses to vigorously develop native pesticides, develop pesticide sources, find more and better effective native pesticides, repair and improve various native and foreign machinery, and at the same time adopt effective agricultural cultivation measures and select disease-resistant and insect-resistant varieties according to local conditions, which should also be given great attention.

　　植物保护
　　中国农业科学院植物保护研究所
    农业增产八字宪法中的“保”字，就是保护农作物不受各种害虫、病原菌、寄生线虫、鸟兽和杂草为害（广义的还应该包括其它各种不利条件的影响），保证农作物正常的生长，获得丰收。因此，植物保护工作就必须是贯彻在农作物从播种到收获整个生育季节中，必须同各项农事活动密切结合并在一定时期成为关键性的措施。
    去年的重要成就
    1958年在植物保护战线上，由于贯彻了党的建设社会主义总路线，普遍掀起了大面积消灭病虫害运动，取得了辉煌的战果，在我国植物保护学史上，写下了光辉的一页。
    采用农业技术和药剂防治相结合的办法消灭病虫害
    全国1958年防治病虫害的面积较1957年扩大了一点六倍。
    全国在十四个省（区）中，有一百七十三个县（市）基本上消灭了螟虫为害，如湖北孝感专区，把螟害率从历年的18％压低到1％以下，江苏省的螟害率也由1957年6.5％压低到
  1％左右。又稻飞虱、浮尘子在湖南宜章县，1957年曾严重为害，损失稻谷一千四百八十万斤左右。1958年由于采用了越冬防治与田间防治相结合，除草与喷药相结合等措施，把发生面积90％以上的稻飞虱及浮尘子，基本上达到全部消灭。主要植棉区由于执行了大面积、集中、连片、短期、彻底的消灭棉虫为害的技术策略，以及组织联防区，加强预测预报，抓住关键时期，进行第一次消灭，第二次扫残的消灭棉田蚜害的斗争；防治了蕾铃期虫害，保护了棉花的蕾铃，在部分地区如河南新乡和山东高唐因虫害脱落率降低到5％以下。
    山西省晋东南专区，根据玉米螟在杂谷的根茬、秸秆、穗轴里过冬，和在玉米生育期集中玉米心叶为害的特点，大搞群众性处理根茬、秸秆、穗轴运动，结合心叶期施药保护，全专区二百余万亩玉米，基本上做到“叶无排空，茎无虫洞，雄穗无风折”，保证了玉米大丰收。山东省聊城专区，通过大搞处理根茬、秸秆等群众性运动，对防治玉米螟为害，也取得了很大成绩。
    在病害方面。1958年很多地区的气候条件，使小麦几种主要病害易于发生。皖苏两省和内蒙古地区都普遍发生了严重的秆锈病。陕西省由于冬季比较温暖，利于病菌的越冬，加以春季多雨，条锈病颇为猖獗。长江两岸，由于春季气温高，连续阴雨，麦类锈病和赤霉病在4月下旬即开始发生，而且发展很快，造成大流行。在党的领导下，安徽、江苏两省的农民群众、科学工作者，在七千余万亩的麦田上，开展了全民性的药剂防治锈病战役，大面积使用石灰硫磺合剂。在药剂供应不足的情况下，通过群众的献计，研究利用猫儿眼，酸模，红蓼等三十余种土农药，有效地防治了小麦秆锈病。土农药防治面积占总防治面积的38.7％。这一奇迹的出现，彻底击败了药剂不能在大面积上防治锈病和单纯依靠抗病品种的观点。而且解决了化学药剂不足的问题。革新了锈病的防治技术，为大规模防治农作物病害，创造了条件。
    采用消灭菌源和药剂普治相结合的办法消灭各种作物病害
    江西省农业科学研究所肯定了带病种子是水稻白叶枯病的初次侵染来源，并研究出有效的以酸性升汞水消毒种子为主的综合防治方法。这一方法在历年发病严重的江西省广丰县推广应用后，该县已基本消灭这种病害。
    稻瘟病在南北稻区很普遍。北方较重，南方扩种粳稻的地区，也在逐年加重。根据各地研究结果，只要突出抓住三个关键：①处理病草、消毒种子、杜绝病源。②加强栽培管理、选用抗病品种、合理施肥。③田间喷药、消灭发病中心。即可有效地防治这种病害。渤海水稻区已将14％的白穗率压缩到3％—8％。抚顺市郊上游人民公社还进行了飞机施药防治稻瘟病，获得安全、省药、省工、收效大的优良效果，创造了应用飞机防治稻瘟病的经验。根据浙、湘、鄂、苏等省的经验，也证明消灭病菌来源，加强栽培管理，提高植株抗病力和喷药保护等综合措施，防治病害效果很好。
    晋北马铃薯产区，根据晚疫病的发病和流行规律，特别针对中心病株的初期发生，采取了“群众普查，哪里发现就在哪里扑灭，层层包围，严密封锁”的技术策略，实行消灭菌源和药剂普治相结合的技术措施，将过去普遍发病的一百多万亩压缩到十万亩以下，因病枯死的面积少于0.1％。当前的任务是，进一步研究找出消毒带病种薯的方法，以获得更省更好的效果。
    小麦秆黑粉病和粪肥感染的腥黑穗病，用六氯代苯和五氯硝基苯拌种有防治特效。对种子粪肥双重传染的腥黑穗病，防治效果可达70％—90％。对秆黑粉病的防治效果达60％—85％。应用拌种兼作土壤处理，能彻底消灭腥黑穗病，消灭秆黑粉病的效果可提高到90％—99％。这种措施，经过全面推广后，能在全国范围内彻底消灭这两种危害小麦的严重病害。
    影响棉苗早期发育的苗病，是造成三类苗的主要原因之一。1958年总结了大面积种子处理，肯定使用五氯硝基苯与西力生混合药剂拌土盖种，结合早中耕和松土间苗等栽培管理技术，根据病情，必要时用波尔多液或硫酸铜液进行喷洒预防，为获得壮苗的有效措施。利用抗生菌“G4”号在大面积棉田内防治黄萎病，选育出抗枯萎病的品种，如147，24—21，523—42等，在生产实践上起到一定的作用。
    采用药剂毒杀和调查研究害虫生活规律，进行捕杀的办法消灭虫害
    在消灭虫害方面。中国农业科学院植物保护研究所创造出药剂处理土壤消灭小麦吸浆虫的方法，在河南新乡专区大面积上进行示范，获得良好效果。这个方法比用六六六粉剂防治吸浆虫成虫的办法，有许多优点：①能消灭土中隔年羽化的幼虫，为根治吸浆虫提供了有效条件；②兼治蛴螬、金针虫、蝼蛄等地下害虫；③克服成虫羽化期因雨不能喷药和麦株密植喷药困难的缺点；④简化了测报手续。
    对于旧社会遗留下来的飞蝗灾害，由于普遍掌握了侦察蝗情的技术，和消灭幼蝻的有利时机，飞蝗已不复成灾。有些地区1958年的飞蝗密度已压低到每百亩中找不到一头残蝗。
    东北农业科学研究机关研究出应用20％纯丙体六六六粉剂拌种，防治油料作物及甜菜苗期害虫，已有成果。在吉林省榆树、永吉、开通等地，大豆、向日葵、蓖麻、甜菜等作物拌种处理后，消灭幼苗期金龟子为害的效果，几达百分之百。
    各研究机构在1958年冬季开展了越冬期棉虫的综合调查。1958年棉铃虫最后一代（第四代）曾在北方棉区猖獗发生。河南省农业科学研究所调查当时的百株卵（虫）数，为历年同代的十倍以上。虽经过大力防治，消灭未彻底的棉田遗留的越冬蛹，为数尚多。根据河南省一百六十块棉田取样检查，每亩平均有蛹六千六百六十六头，其基数较历年显著增多，这一事实，为预测1959年早春棉虫第一代的发生情况，提供了资料。
    其他如浙江萧山县浦沼乡副乡长仔细观察了红铃虫为害的花的特征，找到了摘有虫花帽的办法，准确性达90％，捉虫效率提高一倍。湖北省农业科学研究所利用黑青小蜂防治仓库中的越冬红铃虫，广东省农业科学研究所利用诱集植物防治金钢钻，都在研究工作上或生产上起了很好的作用。
    在预测预报方面，初步掌握了主要的病虫发生规律，提高了预测预报的准确度，培养了大批公社社员作情报员，开展了群众性的普查，这就有条件掌握消灭病虫的有利时机。
    在植物检疫方面。1958年对各地调运的各种种子二十八亿斤，苗木五万一千五百多万株，都进行检疫检验，并建立了无病?种地一百五十三万多亩，苗圃四百一十四个，有力地防止了危险病虫的传播。农业部植物检疫实验室研究出用六六六浸渍方法消灭葡萄插条上根瘤蚜的措施，不仅方法简便易行，效果确实可靠，同时对插条发芽没有不良影响，反而有刺激生长作用。对苹果根部棉蚜，研究出在橱冠外施用对位二氯苯，对一尺深处的棉蚜，杀虫率达百分之百。
    广泛生产土农药，为消灭病虫害创造条件
    在农药方面。全国各研究单位、学校、工厂广泛开展了研究工作。凡有应用价值的杀虫、杀菌、除草、杀鼠和植物刺激素等新农药，经过合成研究，已投入生产的品种占17％。已完成研究，即可投入生产的品种占44.6％。一年以来，在解决当前农药加工所需的乳化剂研究方面，有着飞跃的进展，已获得制法简便、价格低廉的新型乳化剂。调制1059和1605等农药的乳剂，无论从质量和药效上，均已超过西德拜耳厂出品的乳化剂，达到一定水平。此外，用简便方法制成滴滴涕土膏和胶体硫磺，使用效果都很好。
    去年在农药方面，最突出的一点是通过群众性的创造，充分利用植物、动物、矿物和工业副产品等资源，加以试验推广。据统计，全国共发掘出五百余种土农药，建立一百四十七万个土农药厂。使用量达一千六百万吨。据江苏、云南、广西、湖北、山西、陕西六省（区）不完全统计，应用在棉花病虫上的土农药，经过鉴定，防治棉蚜、红蜘蛛、斜纹夜蛾、金钢钻等有效的土农药有七十九种，防治棉病的有效土农药有三十七种，为我国农药研究工作，指出了新的方向。例如从番茄叶提出番茄素，以防治小麦锈病和赤霉病，用石榴皮粉防治白菜软腐病等，均有卓越效果和科学价值。
    上述的实例，仅是植物保护研究工作成就中的一部分。但足已说明我们已经开始摆脱了洋教条的束缚，向社会主义的科学研究大道上迈进。
    同其他措施结合
    植物保护必须同其他各项农业增产措施密切结合进行。忽略了哪一条都不能充分发挥保字本身的作用。如许多农作物害虫的卵、幼虫、蛹，甚至一部分成虫，许多植物病原菌，大部分的杂草种子都是藏在土中，深耕可以把这些害虫和病原菌深埋地下，或翻到上层增加其死亡率，还可切断草根，减少杂草的萌生。用物理的或化学的方法处理土壤，可以防治许多病虫害。同肥料的关系方面，如小麦的腥黑穗病菌就往往能由厩肥带到土里，引起发病。结合积肥，用杂草或植物残株落叶沤肥，可以杀死病菌和害虫。施用抗生菌肥料，可以抑制不少土中病原菌的滋生。另外，在适当时期施用合理比例的氮、磷、钾的追肥，可以增强作物对某些病害的抵抗性。如稻田施用氮肥过多或施的不匀，植株生长嫩弱，抗病力差，就容易得稻瘟病。灌溉不当，也会引起一些病害的滋长。棉花苗期排水不良，棉田湿度大，会增加病害的发展。而棉田冬季灌水，就可促使土中黄萎病菌的死亡。在缺水的稻田中，稻瘟病往往发生严重。至于说到
  “种”，它和防治病虫害的关系就更为明显，有不少作物的病虫害就是借着种子传播的。用物理的机械的方法，可以汰选小麦种子中混杂的线虫病粒，温汤浸种可以防治小麦的散黑穗病和其他许多病害。药剂拌种，能直接杀死附着在种子表面的病菌。有的用药剂处理过的种子播到土中后，还可以防治一些土中为害幼苗的病原和害虫。由于作物品种本身的特性不同，抗病虫能力强的甚至可以免疫，从根本上防止或减少某些病虫的为害。如二四一九号小麦可以抗吸浆虫，一些抗锈品种可以抵抗锈病。密植能改变农作物病虫害发生发展的条件。在密植的田中，植株高大茂密，通风透光的条件差，对病虫害的发生有利。同时田间封垅早，使用机具不便，造成防治上的困难。我们的任务就是要在密植的条件下，创造出一套防治病虫害的有效可行的措施来。“保”和“工”的关系，就更为密切。除了杀虫杀菌的药剂以外，就必须有适当的器械和施药机具，如各种高效率的喷雾、喷粉器等。最后说到“管”。植物保护本身，在实际上就是农作物田间管理工作中的重要组成部分之一，如中耕、培土、灌水、追肥、保持田园清洁、处理残枝落叶、清除病株以及棉花的整枝、打杈等，如果进行的适当，都可以起到积极的保护作用。
    五条综合措施
    植物保护的综合措施，应该包括这样几方面：
    首先是农业生产组织方面的措施，如制定合理的田地的规划，农作物的配置，作物轮栽换茬，灌溉和排涝系统，以及引用抵抗性的品种等等，都是属于这一方面的措施。
    其次是农业技术方面的措施，如从耕作、整地、适时播种、灌水、施肥、田间管理以及处理收获后的植株残余，保持田园清洁等等方面，注意改善农作物生长发育的条件，使这种环境条件对病虫害的发生和发展不利。
    第三是专门的预防措施，如用各种办法处理病虫的越冬寄主，消灭田间和田地周围的杂草，特别是种子处理，都是有效的预防办法。一般病虫潜藏的处所，有土壤、种子、根茬、秸秆、杂草、仓库以及木本寄主植物等等，抓着有利时机，用有效的办法来消灭这些潜伏病虫的巢穴，就可以大大减少其发生为害，收到事半功倍的效果。
    第四方面是属于直接歼灭措施方面的，这就必须要弄清楚各种病虫害传播的途径，生活习性，为害的条件，发生的规律等，用各种有效的方法来扑灭已开始繁殖或大量繁殖的害虫和病菌，这些方法包括有机械物理的（如汰选虫瘿、灯光诱蛾、温汤浸种、低温杀虫等）、化学的（利用各种土洋农药来处理种子土壤及喷粉喷雾等）和生物的（利用害虫的天敌和抗生菌）等等。
    最后是检疫的措施，就是根据调查研究的结果确定检疫对象，划定疫区、保护区，制定检疫制度和检疫的具体办法，有效地制止国外和国内的危险病虫、杂草等的传播，并逐步消灭其为害。
    以上这基本的五方面，在具体实行时，又是互相密切配合的，在某一地区或作物生长的某一阶段，某一方面可能会重点突出的，但是作为一套总的综合措施，就不能单纯抓着一面，而忽略了其他方面的配合，只有用综合措施，才能更好更彻底地控制并逐步消灭其为害，才能在整个农作物生长过程中从各方面保护作物健康的成长，以获更多的产量。
    必须讲求策略
    做好植物保护工作，一定要讲究防治病虫害的策略。1958年在植物保护战线上的一条重要经验，就是要掌握敌情、抓住关键、土洋结合、猛攻巧打，只有这样才能多、快、好、省地消灭病虫害。防治策略上总的要求，就是要防治得准、防治得狠、防治得巧。做到准，就是要弄清病虫害一般的规律，特别是每一种病虫的特殊规律和为害特性，应该有准确及时的预测预报为基础。狠就是要求既全面、又彻底，要不断提高防治质量，扩大防治面积和规模。防治得巧，就是要求有效的技术方法。特别是在今年药械劳力不足的情况下，“巧”就更显得十分重要了。
    植物保护工作，从目前来看，还是农业增产八字宪法中的薄弱环节。去冬今春气温较高，越冬病虫基数较大，死亡率低，活动较早，除应提高警惕注意其发展趋势，还要切实做好药械准备工作。要防治得巧、要节省劳动力和提高效率，不是单纯依靠药剂，有重点地经济合理使用适当的药剂是有效办法之一。除继续创制和生产化学农药外，必须贯彻土洋结合的方针，发动群众大搞土农药，开辟药源，找出更多更好有效的土农药，修配和改善各种土洋器械，同时因地制宜地采用行之有效的农业栽培措施和选用抗病虫品种等，也应该给予很大的重视。
