Xinhua News Agency, Dortmund dispatch: The World Table Tennis Championships' men's and women's team events concluded on March 31st. Both championships were won by the Japanese teams. The Japanese men's team defeated the South Vietnamese team 5-3 on the afternoon of the 31st to secure a place in the final, and then defeated the Hungarian team 5-1 in the final to win the championship. The Japanese women's team defeated the Chinese team 3-0 in the final on the 31st, and then defeated the South Korean team 3-2 to win the championship.

After the conclusion of the team events, the World Championships took a one-day break on April 1st, and the individual championships begin on the 2nd. The individual championships include five events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Hundreds of players from various countries participating in the individual events will engage in fierce and intense battles.

After winning their respective group championships, the Chinese men's and women's teams suffered consecutive defeats in the semi-finals and finals. According to Xinhua News Agency reporters, the reason why the Chinese men's team lost to the Hungarian team was, on the one hand, that the Hungarian team had a high level of technical skill and greatly enhanced offensive capabilities, and they had experience competing against the Chinese team.

On the other hand, although the technical level of the Chinese team itself has greatly improved in the past two years, it is not yet fully consolidated. Some players were nervous during the competition and experienced abnormal performances, such as inaccurate smashing, weak pulling, and offensive errors, or they were overly cautious and did not dare to attack boldly, thus missing opportunities. At the same time, the Chinese team's group stage matches, especially the men's team's matches against West Germany and Sweden, revealed some weaknesses, which can also be said to be one of the reasons for this defeat. In addition, Wang Chuanyao, one of the main offensive players, suffered a sprain in his right upper arm in February and had not participated in competitions for a long time, which inevitably had some impact.

In addition to a technical level that was still inferior to their opponents, the women's team's final defeat was also due to shortcomings such as nervousness during the competition and abnormal performance.

### 世界乒乓球男女团体赛结束  日本男女队获得冠军　个人冠军赛今日开始

    世界乒乓球男女团体赛结束
    日本男女队获得冠军　个人冠军赛今日开始
    本报综合报道　据新华社多特蒙德消息：世界乒乓球锦标赛男女团体赛已于3月31日结束。男女两组冠军都为日本队所获得。日本男子队于31日下午以五比三击败南越队而取得决赛权，然后在决赛中以五比一战胜匈牙利队而取得冠军。日本女子队在31日的决赛中以三比○击败中国队后，又以三比二战胜南朝鲜队而获得冠军。
    世界锦标赛在结束团体赛后，于4月1日休息一天，2日开始个人冠军赛。个人冠军赛计有男子单打、女子单打、男子双打、女子双打和男女混合双打五项。参加个人赛的数百名各国选手，将展开激烈和紧张的战斗。
    我国男女队在分别取得小组冠军后，在复赛和决赛中连遭失败。据新华社记者的报道：我国男子队所以败于匈牙利队，一方面是匈牙利队具有高度的技术水平，进攻能力有很大加强，他们和中国队有比赛经验。
    另一方面中国队本身的技术水平近两年虽有很大提高，但还不是十分巩固，有些队员临场紧张，有失常现象，如：扣球不准，拉球无力，对攻失误等，或者过分小心，不敢大胆进攻，因而丧失时机。同时中国队在这次分组比赛、特别是男子队在同西德、瑞典队的比赛中较明显地暴露了一些弱点，这也可以说是这次比赛失利的原因之一。另外，主攻力量之一王传耀因2月间右上臂扭伤，长时间没有参加比赛，也不能不受一些影响。
    女子队最后的失利除了技术水平还逊于对方外，也有着临场紧张发生失常现象等缺点。
