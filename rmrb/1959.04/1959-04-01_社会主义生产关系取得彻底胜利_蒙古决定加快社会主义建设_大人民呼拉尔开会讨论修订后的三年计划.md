Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, March 30th. The Third Session of the Third Great People's Khural of Mongolia opened this afternoon in Ulaanbaatar.

The assembly heard a report by Tsend, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, on the draft of Mongolia's 1958-1960 National Economic and Cultural Development Three-Year Plan. This draft plan was put forward based on the instructions of the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party regarding the Three-Year Plan and the resolution of the Party Central Committee plenary session in March of this year.

In his report, Tsend stated that since the Party discussed and approved the Three-Year Plan instructions, some events of great historical significance have occurred in Mongolia's domestic and international situation, as well as in the lives of the Party and the people. These events made it necessary to make corresponding revisions to the Three-Year Plan.

Tsend pointed out that last year was a year of complete victory for socialist production relations in Mongolia. If, at the time of the 13th Congress of the People's Revolutionary Party, only 35% of agricultural and pastoral households nationwide had joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, that number has now reached 96%, basically completing agricultural and pastoral collectivization. Now, the remnants of small private ownership in agriculture, animal husbandry, and commerce no longer have a decisive significance in people's lives. In this way, Mongolia's national economy has become a unified socialist economy based on two forms of socialist ownership. This marks a great victory for the Party and the working people.

Tsend continued, due to the consolidation of the unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, Mongolia's international status has been further consolidated, and its ties with fraternal countries have become closer. Our great neighbors—the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries—are gradually increasing their assistance to Mongolia. He also said that the conclusion put forward by the 21st Congress of the CPSU regarding the roughly simultaneous transition of all socialist countries to the higher stage of communist society by utilizing their own possibilities is of particular importance to Mongolia. Accelerating the development speed of every socialist country, including Mongolia, will contribute to the achievements of the entire socialist system. Tsend pointed out that all of this makes it necessary to make certain supplements and modifications to the Three-Year Plan in order to accelerate the development speed of Mongolia's socialist construction.

Tsend pointed out that the main task of the Three-Year Plan is to ensure a new high in national productivity, comprehensively develop the socialist sector of agriculture and animal husbandry, and on this basis, improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

The Three-Year Plan stipulates that by 1960, the total number of livestock in the country will increase by 7.2% compared with 1957, while also improving the productivity of livestock products.

During the Three-Year Plan period, Mongolia's most important task in developing agriculture is to reclaim wasteland on a large scale and drastically increase the total output of agricultural products. Completing this task is directly related to the development of animal husbandry, to settling nomadic herdsmen, and will also play an important role in ensuring the supply of flour and other products to residents and ensuring the needs of industry for raw materials. In view of this, the Three-Year Plan stipulates that the total sown area of the country should be increased to 3.1 times this year by 1960, reaching 257,200 hectares.

Tsend said that the main task of developing industry is to further develop national industry by widely utilizing domestic raw materials. The Three-Year Plan stipulates that a solid foundation must be laid for the more powerful development of industry in recent years. The revised draft plan stipulates that the total industrial output value will increase by 53.2% compared to 1957, of which coal production will increase from 407,000 tons in 1957 to 790,000 tons in 1960, electricity from 58.4 million kilowatt-hours to 70.4 million kilowatt-hours, and leather shoes from 634,000 pairs to 1,167,000 pairs. In order to develop the mining industry of rare metals, the plan stipulates to vigorously carry out geological exploration work.

Tsend said that due to the upsurge of socialist construction, the revised plan stipulates that the state investment in basic construction in the three years will increase by 195 million tugriks compared with the original plan, reaching 895 million tugriks, which is equal to 4.4 times the total investment in basic construction during the first Five-Year Plan, or 49.5% more than the basic investment of the second Five-Year Plan. Considering the material, technical, and financial assistance from the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, the total investment in basic construction in Mongolia in the three years will reach 1.3 billion tugriks.

Tsend pointed out that within three years, Mongolia's cultural and educational undertakings and the people's living standards will be further developed and improved. Seven-year education will be gradually popularized in larger cities, and labor education will be strengthened in schools, and teaching must be combined with production. Within three years, the wage fund for workers and staff will increase by 18%, the cash income of cooperative members will increase by at least 40%, and the state's social insurance fees and subsidies will increase threefold, and 220,000 square meters of housing will be built for residents.

Tsend finally said that 1959 is a decisive year in completing the Three-Year Plan. Completing and overfulfilling this year's plan will be of extremely important significance for realizing the entire Three-Year Plan. In order to do this, the Party and state organs and various mass organizations must improve the level of political, educational, and organizational work among the masses, and widely support all initiatives and creative initiatives of the working people.

Next, Mongolian Minister of Finance Dugersuren gave a report on the 1959 national budget and the 1957 budget execution.

Dugersuren said that the national budget revenue for 1959 is 815.3 million tugriks, an increase of 5.5% over 1958; the national budget expenditure for 1959 is 809.9 million tugriks, an increase of 13.2% over 1958.

Dugersuren pointed out that income from the socialist economic sector will account for 92% of the total budget revenue. This year's tax revenue is 65.3 million tugriks, a decrease of 9.7 million tugriks from last year, accounting for 8% of the budget revenue.

Dugersuren said that among this year's budget expenditures, expenditures for developing the national economy and for social and cultural welfare facilities account for 81.8% of the budget, an increase of 11.5% over last year. This year's investment in basic construction is 291 million tugriks, an increase of 25.2% over 1958.

    社会主义生产关系取得彻底胜利
    蒙古决定加快社会主义建设
    大人民呼拉尔开会讨论修订后的三年计划
    三年计划主要指标：急剧增加农业品总产量，三年内总播种面积增加两倍多。牲畜总头数将增加7.2％。广泛利用本国原料发展工业，工业总产值增加53.2％。将在较大城市逐步普及七年制教育，学校中将加强劳动教育。人民生活水平将进一步提高。
    新华社乌兰巴托30日电　蒙古第三届大人民呼拉尔第三次会议今天下午在乌兰巴托开幕。
    大会听取了部长会议第一副主席曾德所作的关于蒙古1958—1960年发展国民经济和文化的三年计划草案的报告，这个计划草案是根据蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会关于三年计划的指示和今年三月党中央全体会议的决议提出来的。
    曾德在报告中说，在党讨论和批准了三年计划指示以后，蒙古的国内外形势以及党和人民的生活中，都发生了一些有重大历史意义的事件，这些事件使得有必要对三年计划作相应的修改。
    曾德指出，去年是蒙古社会主义生产关系取得彻底胜利的一年，如果说在人民革命党举行第十三次代表大会的时候，加入农牧业合作社的农牧户只占全国农牧户总数的35％，那么现在已经占到96％，基本上完成了农牧业合作化。现在，农牧业和商业中的小私有制残余在人民生活中已经没有决定意义了。这样，蒙古的国民经济就成了建立在两种社会主义所有制形式之上的、单一的社会主义经济。这标志着党和劳动人民的伟大胜利。
    曾德接着说，由于以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和力量的巩固，蒙古的国际地位更加巩固了，和兄弟国家的联系更加紧密了。我们伟大的邻邦——苏联、中国以及其他社会主义国家给予蒙古的援助逐渐增加。他又说，苏共第二十一次代表大会提出的关于各社会主义国家利用自己的可能性将大致同时过渡到共产主义社会高级阶段的结论，对蒙古有着特别重要的意义。加快包括蒙古在内的每个社会主义国家的发展速度，将有助于整个社会主义体系的成就。曾德指出，所有这些都使得有必要对三年计划作某些补充和修改，以便加快蒙古的社会主义建设的发展速度。
    曾德指出，三年计划的主要任务是保证国家生产力的新高涨，全面发展农牧业的社会主义部门，并在这个基础上提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平。
    三年计划规定，到1960年，全国的牲畜总头数将比1957年增加7.2％，同时要提高牲畜的产品生产率。
    在三年计划期间，蒙古在发展农业方面的最重要的任务是大面积地开垦荒地和急剧增加农产品总产量。完成这一任务同发展畜牧业、同使农牧民定居下来有直接关系，同时也将在保证对居民的面粉和其他产品的供应、保证工业对原料的需要方面起重要作用。有鉴于此，三年计划规定把全国的总播种面积到1960年增加为今年的三点一倍，即达到二十五万七千二百公顷。
    曾德说，发展工业的主要任务是广泛利用本国原料进一步发展民族工业。三年计划规定，必须为最近一些年工业的更加强大的发展建立巩固的基础。修改后的计划草案规定把工业总产值比1957年增加53.2％其中煤产量将从1957年的四十万七千吨增加到1960年的七十九万吨，电力从五千八百四十万度增加到七千零四十万度，皮鞋从六十三万四千双增加到一百一十六万七千双。为了发展稀有金属的开采工业，计划规定大力开展地质勘探工作。
    曾德说，由于社会主义建设的高涨，修改后的计划规定三年内的基本建设国家投资比原计划增加一亿九千五百万图格里克，达到八亿九千五百万图格里克，这等于第一个五年计划期间基本建设投资总和的四点四倍，或者比第二个五年计划的基本投资多49.5％。考虑到苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的物质技术和财政援助，三年间蒙古的基本建设投资总额将达十三亿图格里克。
    曾德指出，三年内，蒙古的文化教育事业和人民的生活水平将进一步发展和提高，将在较大的城市逐步普及七年制教育，学校中将加强劳动教育，教学要和生产相结合。三年内，职工工资基金将增加18％，合作社社员的现金收入至少增加40％，国家的社会保险费和补助金等将增加到三倍，将为居民建筑二十二万平方公尺的住宅。
    曾德最后说，1959年是完成三年计划方面有决定性的一年。完成和超额完成今年的计划对实现整个三年计划将有极其重要的意义。为了作到这一点，党和国家机关以及各群众组织必须提高对群众的政治、教育和组织工作的水平，广泛支持劳动人民的一切倡议和创造性主动性。
    接着，蒙古财政部长杜格苏伦在会上作了1959年国家预算和1957年预算执行情况的报告。
    杜格苏伦说，1959年的国家预算收入为八亿一千五百三十万图格里克，比1958年增加5.5％；1959年国家预算支出为八亿零九百九十万图格里克，比1958年增加13.2％。
    杜格苏伦指出，来自社会主义经济部门的收入将占预算总收入的92％。今年的税收额为六千五百三十万图格里克，比去年减少九百七十万图格里克，占预算收入的8％。
    杜格苏伦说，今年的预算支出中用于发展国民经济和用于社会文化福利设施的支出占预算的81.8％，比去年增加11.5％。今年的基本建设投资为二亿九千一百万图格里克，比1958年增加25.2％。
