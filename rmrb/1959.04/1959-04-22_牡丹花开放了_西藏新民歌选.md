    Peonies are Blooming
    —Selected New Tibetan Folk Songs

    The Sun and the Moon
    Chairman Mao is like the sun,
    Chairman Mao is like the moon,
    When the sun rises, all things grow,
    When the moon rises, travelers have direction in the dark.

    Chairman Mao's Kindness
    Chairman Mao's kindness,
    Is like the winter sunshine,
    We bathe in it,
    Filled with happiness and hope.

    The Beloved People's Liberation Army Has Arrived
    The beloved People's Liberation Army has arrived,
    Issuing interest-free loans,
    The people who suffered deeply,
    Are heading towards an auspicious and prosperous world.

    Our Loved Ones
    The leader Chairman Mao cares for us,
    The People's Liberation Army provides interest-free loans,
    Imperialism oppressed us,
    The savior Chairman Mao helps us.
    We understand in our hearts:
    Who are our loved ones,
    Who are our enemies!

    Peonies are Blooming
    The motherland's west has the best place,
    Where the most beautiful peonies grow;
    But in the past, the peonies never bloomed,
    —Because of the deep waters and scorching fire.
    Now the peonies are blooming,
    Chairman Mao leads us from among the flowers.

    Unfading Flowers
    Children born of the same parents,
    Are originally close brothers.
    Living under Chairman Mao's sun,
    May we live to be a ripe old age.
    Thousand-year-lasting peonies bloom on the mountain tops,
    People live among the flowers,
    May they never wither.

    Following the People's Liberation Army
    Seeing the People's Liberation Army in the daytime,
    Is like seeing the sun!
    Seeing the People's Liberation Army at night,
    Is like seeing the moon!
    We will always follow you,
    The road is bright and clear!

    牡丹花开放了
    ——西藏新民歌选
    太阳和月亮
    毛主席像太阳，
    毛主席像月亮，
    太阳出来万物能生长，
    月亮出来黑夜行人有方向。
    毛主席的恩情
    毛主席的恩情，
    像冬天的阳光，
    我们沐浴在里面，
    充满了幸福和希望。
    来了亲人解放军
    来了亲人解放军，
    发放了无利贷款，
    苦难深重的人们，
    走向吉祥如意的世界。
    我们的亲人
    关心我们的是领袖毛主席，
    无利贷款的是人民解放军，
    压迫我们的是帝国主义，
    帮助我们的是救星毛主席。
    我们心里明白：
    谁是我们的亲人，
    谁是我们的仇敌！
    牡丹花开放了
    祖国的西方有块最好的地方，
    在那里长的有最美的牡丹花；
    但是在过去牡丹花从未开放，
    ——因为水深火热。
    现在牡丹花开放了，
    毛主席引着我们从花
    丛中走出来。
    不雕的花朵
    同一父母生下来的孩子呀，
    本来就是亲兄弟。
    生活在毛主席的太阳下，
    愿我们万寿无疆。
    山头上开了千年不败
    的牡丹花，
    人们生活在鲜花里，
    愿它永远不雕谢。
    跟着解放军
    白天见了解放军，
    如同见太阳！
    黑夜见了解放军，
    如同见月亮！
    永远跟着您呵，
    大道儿明光光！
