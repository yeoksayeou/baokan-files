    Healthy Laughter
    Lin Ling
    "Female Shop Assistant" is a new comedy that praises the new era, new life, and new things of our country. It has evoked a lot of healthy laughter from the audience. Comrade Lao She's new work is praiseworthy because there are too few comedies that praise our new society and new life, and even fewer comedies that draw material from the life familiar to each of us. This is a good start.
    A new phenomenon that has emerged in the Great Leap Forward is that women are replacing men in many jobs, allowing men to do other work. Working as a shop assistant is a job where women can largely replace men. Although older men can also be employed in large numbers in sales positions, at present, having women take on these roles carries the important meaning of liberating female labor and raising the status of women. The theme of "Female Shop Assistant" is built on this idea.
    Drama needs conflict, and comedy needs clear and sharp conflict. The conflict in "Female Shop Assistant" lies on one hand in whether being a shop assistant is a lowly profession, on the other hand in whether women can take on all kinds of shop assistant work (such as selling meat and fish), and thirdly in the question of who will take care of household chores when women leave home to work in shops. There is a series of contradictions here. The author has grasped these contradictions, exposed them, and correctly handled these contradictions among the people. In the process of handling them, he mocked the opposite side of those contradictions, which aroused joyful laughter from the audience.
    The satire has a definite target, and the ridicule contains a deep meaning of teaching, so the audience's laughter is healthy laughter. This is the success of this comedy.
    Among all the contradictions, the three types of contradictions expressed through the characters—Section Chief Wei's pedantic views, shop assistant Tao's sense of inferiority, and Aunt Qi's stubborn backwardness—are the most vividly written by the author. After the first two contradictions are resolved, the latter, Aunt Qi's, the opposite side, is consistently maintained, which is a characteristic of this comedy.
    In our lives, there are still many people like Old Wei and Little Tao, and Aunt Qi's thoughts are still cleverly hidden in the consciousness of many people. She does not oppose gender equality and women's liberation, but she looks down on the work of female shop assistants. She believes that women becoming ministers and movie stars is what raises their status, and she also did women's work when she was young, which further provides cover for her stubbornness. The author writes this character vividly, and the actor plays this role with lifelike energy, which allows the comedic conflict of "Female Shop Assistant" to be fully expressed.
    In the past, the Beijing People's Art Theater did not seem to perform many comedies, but the success of "Female Shop Assistant" shows that they are capable of performing comedies well. Director Mei Qian seems to be good at handling comedies. In many places in the play, one can see the drama beyond the words, the meaning beyond the play, the laughter in the action, and the satire in the laughter.

    健康的笑
    林陵
    “女店员”是一出歌颂我国新时代新生活新事物的新喜剧，它引起观众不少健康的笑声。老舍同志的这一新作，所以值得赞美，就是因为现在歌颂我们新社会新生活的喜剧太少了，从我们每一个人所熟悉的生活里抓取题材来写作的喜剧更少了。这是一个很好的开端。
    在大跃进形势中出现的一个新现象，是好多种工作由女子代替男子做，让男子去做其他工作。商店售货是可以大量由女子来代替男子的一种工作，虽然售货工作也可以大量用年龄较大的男子来担任，但在目前说，由妇女来担任，是包含着解放妇女劳动力、提高妇女地位这一重要意义的。“女店员”的主题就建筑在这一思想上。
    戏剧要有矛盾，喜剧更需要有明朗而尖锐的矛盾。“女店员”的矛盾一方面是售货员是否是卑微的职业，另一方面是妇女是否能担任各种各样售货员的工作（例如卖肉、卖鱼），第三方面是妇女离家到店里去工作，家务由谁管的问题。这里面有一系列的矛盾，作者抓住了这些矛盾，揭露了这些矛盾，正确地处理了这些人民内部矛盾，在处理过程中嘲笑了那些矛盾的对立面，引起了观众欢乐的笑声。
    讽刺有确当的对象，嘲笑里包含了教训的深义，所以观众的欢笑是健康的笑，这是这个喜剧的成功之处。
    在一切矛盾之中，通过人物来表现的三个类型的矛盾：魏科员的迂腐见解、陶售货员的自卑感、齐大妈的顽固落后，作者写得最为生动；在前两者矛盾都解决之后，后者齐大妈的这个对立面始终保持下来，更是这一喜剧的特点。
    在我们的生活中，老魏和小陶当然还不乏其人，而齐大妈的思想也还巧妙地藏在许多人的意识中。她不反对男女平等、妇女解放，但她看不起女店员的工作，她认为妇女做部长、当电影明星才是提高地位，而且她年轻时也是做妇女工作的，这就更为她的顽固找到了掩护。作者把这人物写得淋漓尽致，演员把这角色演得活龙活现，这就使“女店员”喜剧式的矛盾冲突尽情地发挥出来了。
    过去北京人民艺术剧院似乎不大演喜剧，但“女店员”的成功说明他们是能够演好喜剧的。导演梅阡同志，看来是善于处理喜剧的，在戏的好多地方，可以看出言外之戏，戏外之意，动作中的笑，笑声中的讽意。
