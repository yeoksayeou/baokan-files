Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 21st dispatch: Some Indian newspapers have published commentaries expressing doubts about whether the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" issued on April 18 was issued by the Dalai Lama himself. Some newspapers said that it had many loopholes.

    The "Hindu" published an article on the front page on the 20th, written by Ranga Swamy, the newspaper's special correspondent in New Delhi, commenting on the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." The article said, "There is an impression here that the Dalai Lama's statement has many loopholes. For example, it did not mention the letters exchanged between the Dalai Lama and General Tan, the Chinese military commander in Lhasa. Perhaps one can guess that Menon, the representative of the Indian government, showed the Dalai Lama the text of the letters published by Beijing. Since the Dalai Lama confirmed that he had accepted the invitation from the Chinese Command to watch a cultural performance, he did not want to deny the authenticity of the letters."

    The article said, "Another aspect of the situation – which people consider to be even more fundamental – remains to be clarified. The Dalai Lama systematically narrated all the events leading to the appointment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1956. Then, the Dalai Lama talked about the events that happened in March this year, but he did not talk about what happened in the three years in between. People think these three years are particularly relevant. Beijing announced in 1956 that within six years, the Chinese government would hand over the task of reform to the Tibetan government itself. To know the full picture of the situation, one should know what the Tibetan government did and did not do in these three years. Beijing has been saying that this period was used to organize an open rebellion in Tibet. The Dalai Lama's statement apparently did not mention the period from his negotiations with the Chinese authorities to his escape from Lhasa. What happened during this period will provide clues to the point: who fired the first shot in the battle for the Dalai Lama himself rather than for Lhasa. This is not clear." The article also said, "The Dalai Lama's statement said: even when negotiations were underway, the Chinese sent reinforcements. The statement also said that on March 17, two or three mortar shells were fired at the Dalai Lama's palace. Only after this incident did the Dalai Lama's advisors decide that they should leave Lhasa."

    The article also said, "Until now, the impression in Delhi is that the Dalai Lama left Lhasa on March 17, and the Chinese only found out about his escape two or three days later. It is difficult to reconcile the Chinese wanting to get the Dalai Lama and, at the same time, shelling his palace when he was in it. These and some other mysteries in the Tibetan incident still need to be clarified. When Nehru meets with the Dalai Lama this weekend, the situation will undoubtedly be clarified."

    The Bengali daily "Yugantar" said on the 20th, "It is difficult to accept the Buddhist King's political statement with satisfaction."

    It said: "We would like to ask the Dalai Lama's advisors, why is there no mention of the three letters in the Dalai Lama's long statement? When the Beijing government accused that those letters were written by the Dalai Lama himself, wouldn't it be appropriate to mention these letters, even to maintain the Dalai Lama's prestige and moral purity?" It asked: "If those letters have even a certain degree of authenticity, then what is the value of the Dalai Lama's current statement?"

    The newspaper said: "This statement is long enough and is skillfully drafted, so that simple-minded readers will think after reading it that the Chinese are very brutal, and Tibetan Lamaism is extremely innocent and sacred. However, anyone who understands the current Cold War, international espionage and conspiracies, the internal social structure and economic system of Tibet, the serfdom of the medieval Lama system, the land system, and the historical relationship between China and Tibet, can understand that the Dalai Lama's statement is neither surprising nor unexpected."

      The political reporter of "The Statesman" regretfully noted that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement was not issued in the first person," and completely lacked "spontaneity." The newspaper admitted that the statement's "overtly impersonal tone" may give the impression that the Dalai Lama is being constrained.

    Another newspaper, "The Tribune," also expressed doubts about the authenticity of the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" in an editorial published on the 20th. It believes that either this statement or Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress is not true. It believes that regardless of the right or wrong of China's handling of the Tibet issue, "Chinese leaders would not be so naive as to fabricate news about the Dalai Lama."

### 印度一些报纸指出  所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”漏洞很多  认为这个声明是否达赖本人发表值得怀疑

    印度一些报纸指出
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”漏洞很多
    认为这个声明是否达赖本人发表值得怀疑
    新华社21日讯　新德里消息：印度的一些报纸发表评论，对4月18日发表的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”是否他本人发表的表示怀疑，有的报纸说它漏洞很多。
    “印度教徒报”20日在头版刊登了这家报纸驻新德里特派记者兰加斯瓦米所写的评论所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的文章。文章说，“这里有这样一种印象：达赖喇嘛的声明有许多漏洞。譬如，它未提达赖喇嘛和中国驻拉萨的军事司令谭将军交换的信件。也许可以猜测，印度政府的代表梅农把北京公布的信件的文本给达赖喇嘛看了。既然达赖喇嘛证实了他曾经接受到中国司令部去看文艺表演的邀请，他没有想否认信件的真实性。”
    文章说，“局势的另一个方面——人们认为这甚至是更为基本的——尚待澄清。达赖喇嘛有条不紊地叙述了导致在1956年任命西藏筹备委员会的一切事件。然后，达赖喇嘛谈到了今年3月发生的事件，他没有谈到在这当中的三年所发生的事情。人们认为这三年是特别有关系的。北京曾在1956年宣布，在六年内，中国政府将把进行改革的任务交由西藏政府本身进行。为了知道局势的全貌，人们就应该知道，在这三年中，西藏政府做了些什么，没有做些什么。北京一直在说，这一时期被利用来在西藏组织公开的叛乱。在达赖喇嘛的声明中，显然没有提到从他同中国当局谈判 到他逃离拉萨这一段时间，在这段期间发生的事情将为下面一点提供线索：在为争夺达赖喇嘛本人而不是争夺拉萨而进行的战斗中，放第一枪的是谁。这点是不清楚的”。文章还说，“达赖喇嘛的声明说：甚至当谈判在进行的时候，中国人派来了增援部队。声明还说，3月17日，曾经向着达赖喇嘛的宫殿打了两三发迫击炮弹，仅仅在发生了这件事以后，达赖喇嘛的顾问才决定他们要离开拉萨。”
    文章还说，“迄今，德里的印象是：达赖喇嘛是在3月17日离开拉萨的，中国人在两三天以后才知道他逃跑了。中国人想得到达赖喇嘛，同时，当他在宫内的时候，中国人又炮击他的宫殿，要把这两者调和起来是困难的。在西藏事件中的这些和其他一些神秘之处还要弄清楚。当尼赫鲁周末会见达赖喇嘛的时候，情况无疑会得到澄清。”
    孟加拉文日报“划时代报”在20日说，“很难满意地接受佛王的这个政治声明”。
    它说：“我们谨向达赖喇嘛的顾问们问一下，为什么在达赖喇嘛的长篇声明中只字未提三封信？当北京政府提出责难说那些信是达赖喇嘛的亲笔信时，即使是为了维护达赖喇嘛的威信和道德上的纯洁，难道提一提这些信不是适当的吗？”它问道：“如果那些信甚至有一定程度的真实性的话，那么达赖喇嘛目前的声明有什么价值呢？”
    这家报纸说：“这个声明是够长的，并且是很巧妙地草拟的，以致头脑简单的读者在读后会认为中国人是十分暴虐的，而西藏的喇嘛教是极其无辜和神圣的。但是，凡是了解目前冷战、国际间谍和阴谋活动、西藏内部的社会结构和经济制度、中世纪的喇嘛制度的农奴制、土地制度和中国和西藏之间的历史关系的人，都能理解达赖喇嘛的这个声明既不会令人感到惊奇，也没有出乎意外。”
      “政治家报”的政治记者遗憾地注意到：所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明并不是以第一人称发表的”，完全没有“自发性”。该报承认，声明的“公开地无特定人格的语调”可能给人以达赖喇嘛是受到束缚的印象。
    另一家报纸“论坛报”在20日发表的社论中也表示怀疑这个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的真实性。它认为，这个声明和周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的“政府工作报告”“这两个互相矛盾的声明总有一个不是真实的。”它认为，不管中国在处理西藏问题上的是非如何，“中国领导不至于天真到捏造关于达赖喇嘛的消息”。
