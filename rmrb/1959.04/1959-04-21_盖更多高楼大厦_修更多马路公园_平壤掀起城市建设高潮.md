Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 20th: This reporter reports: The heroic city of Pyongyang is full of spring, and the labor army composed of workers and students is launching an unprecedented high tide of urban construction in Pyongyang with the heroic spirit of "riding on the Chollima."

This year, the scale of Pyongyang's construction is equivalent to 2.3 times that of last year, and these construction projects have been fully launched. At present, among the high-rise buildings that have been built in Pyongyang and the lush green willows all over the city, cranes are busy waving their giant arms. The largest theater in North Korea—the opera house with two thousand seats, the modern circus, the Children's Palace, the comprehensive news building, as well as new residential areas, shops, and ninety-seven nurseries and kindergartens, etc., have all started construction one after another, and some have entered a tense construction stage.

After five years of construction after the war, the center of Pyongyang has been filled with high-rise buildings. This spring, Pyongyang's construction projects are also expanding to the suburbs. A new residential area in Datolling in the suburbs, which can accommodate 7,000 households, is under construction, and a newly opened tree-lined avenue, five kilometers long and sixty meters wide, is undergoing intensive sewer laying work. In Dasheng Mountain in the suburbs, students from Kim Il Sung University are building a zoo and botanical garden.

At present, the builders of various projects in and around Pyongyang are stepping up construction day and night in order to complete the first phase of this year's construction projects before the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

In order to allow Pyongyang residents to live better, Pyongyang will build more than 20,000 houses this year, which will account for 60% to 70% of the city's total construction volume this year. The houses built this year are spacious and comfortable, with an average floor area of more than 50 square meters per household. The reporter visited the newly built residential buildings this spring. Each apartment in the building has two or three large rooms, as well as a private kitchen, tiled toilet and bath room. Large lawns will also be cultivated around the building. To facilitate residents, department stores, food stores, schools, nurseries and other public facilities are built in every residential area of 5,000 households.

This year, 96% of the new houses built in Pyongyang will be constructed using prefabricated methods. After large-scale promotion last year, Pyongyang's construction workers have been able to master this industrialized construction method very skillfully. According to this year's plan, each construction worker in Pyongyang will assemble an average of 20 houses a year. The reporter visited a newly assembled five-story building with 95 households, which was built in a short period of one and a half months. Construction workers said that soon, the time to assemble such a building can be shortened to 20 days.

This year, Pyongyang will also build and expand many parks. In addition to Dasheng Mountain Park, parks such as Moranbong, Liberation Mountain, and Changguang Mountain are also being expanded. Students are the main force in building parks. Students from the University of Construction are turning Qingshang Valley, a deserted valley on Moranbong, into a Qingshang Garden. Now there is an open-air theater for ten thousand people, an artificial waterfall, a stepped flower bed built along the hillside, and a large fountain that can spray water 13 meters high is under construction. This park, designed and constructed by students of the University of Construction, will become one of the most beautiful places in Pyongyang after it opens on "May 1st." At the same time, other parks of all sizes and street parks newly built in Pyongyang will transform Pyongyang into a city of flowers.

In addition, this year Pyongyang will pave 100 kilometers of roads and complete the city's underground pipeline network and electric power industry network. The workers building the second pedestrian bridge over the Taedong River, regardless of the cold water in the winter and the current spring flood, have built all eight piers out of the water, and strive to complete the construction of the bridge during the "August 15th" National Day this year.

This year, the scale of Pyongyang's industrial infrastructure construction is also very large. A thermal power plant with a power generation capacity of 200,000 kilowatts and the expansion project of the Pyongyang Textile Factory are under construction. (Attached picture)

    平壤掀起城市建设高潮
    新华社平壤20日电　本社记者报道：英雄城平壤春意正浓，由工人和学生组成的劳动大军正以“跨上千里马”的豪放气势，掀起一个规模空前的平壤城市建设的高潮。
    今年平壤的建设规模相当于去年的二点三倍，这些建设工程已经全面展开。目前，在平壤市面已经建起的高楼大厦之间和满城的嫩绿垂柳丛中，一座座起重机正在忙碌地挥动着巨臂。全朝鲜最大的剧场——有二千座位的歌剧院、现代化的马戏场、儿童宫、综合新闻大楼以及一片片的新住宅、商店和九十七所托儿所、幼儿园等建设工程，都已经陆续开工，有的已经进入紧张施工阶段。
    经过战后五年来的建设，平壤市中心已经布满高楼大厦，今春平壤的建设工程还正向市郊扩展。市郊大驼岭的一个可容七千户居民的新住宅区正在兴建，新辟的一条五公里长、六十公尺宽的林荫大道则在紧张地进行下水道铺设工程。在市郊大圣山，金日成大学的学生们正在建设动物园和植物园。
    目前，平壤市内、市郊各项工程的建设者们为了在“五一”国际劳动节前完成今年第一阶段的建设工程，正在日夜加紧施工。
    为了让平壤居民住得更好，平壤今年将再建设二万多户住宅，这批住宅工程将占这个城市今年总建设量的60％到70％。今年建设的住宅宽畅舒适，平均每户有五十多平方公尺的建筑面积。记者参观了今春新建成的住宅大楼。大楼中的每户住宅都有两个或三个宽大的房间，还有自用的厨房、铺砌瓷砖的厕所和澡房。大楼周围还将培植大片草坪。为了便利居民，每一个五千户的居民区内，都建设了百货店、食品店、学校和托儿所等公共设施。
    今年平壤新建的住宅中，用装配方法建设的占96％。经过去年的大规模推广，目前平壤的建筑工人已经能够十分熟练地掌握这种工业化的建筑方法，根据今年的计划，平壤的每个建筑工人将在一年中平均装配二十户住宅。记者参观的一座新装配成的九十五户的五层大楼就是在一个半月的短短期间建成的。建筑工人们说，不久以后，装配这样一座大楼的时间将可以缩短到二十天。
    今年，平壤还将新建和扩建很多公园。除了大圣山公园以外，还有牡丹峰、解放山、昌光山等公园都在扩建。学生们是建设公园的主力。建设大学的学生们正在把牡丹峰的一条荒废的山谷——庆尚谷修成一个庆尚花园。现在这里已经出现了露天万人剧场、人造瀑布、沿着山坡修起的阶梯式大花坛，一座能够喷水十三公尺高的大喷水池则正在修建中。这座由建设大学学生自己设计和施工的公园在“五一”节开放以后，将成为平壤市最美丽的一个去处。而同时在平壤新建的其它一些大大小小的公园和街头公园将把平壤打扮成一个花的城市。
    另外，今年平壤要铺修长达一百公里的马路，全部完成市内的上下水道网和电力工业网。建设大同江上第二座人行桥的工人们不顾去冬天寒水冷和当前的春汛，已经把八座桥墩全部修出水面，并且争取在今年“八·一五”国庆时完成这座桥梁的建设工程。
    今年平壤的工业基本建设工程的规模也很大。一座发电能力为二十万瓩的火力发电站和平壤纺织工厂的扩建工程都正在加紧施工。（附图片）
