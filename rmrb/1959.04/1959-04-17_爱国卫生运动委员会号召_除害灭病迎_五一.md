Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The person in charge of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee made a statement to reporters of this agency on carrying out a pest and disease eradication campaign before the "May Day" holiday, saying: This spring's patriotic health campaign, due to its close combination with the central tasks of spring production, started early, coordinated well, was tightly grasped, and acted quickly, resulting in significant results. Because more attention was paid to fundamental work in the movement, the basic construction of sanitation work was vigorously carried out, and many overwintering pests were eliminated. The movement also further strengthened the sanitation work of collective welfare undertakings, paid special attention to labor protection and the arrangement of work and rest in industrial and agricultural production, strengthened the health management of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, and universally trained cooks, food administrators, child-care workers, midwives, and health workers, greatly improving the health knowledge level of these personnel and the broad masses, and guaranteeing the health of the people. Significant achievements have been made in eliminating diseases and preventing acute infectious diseases, parasitic diseases, and endemic diseases in winter and spring. At present, the movement is entering a sprint climax to greet the "May Day" International Labor Day cleanly and neatly.

The person in charge said: The period around "May Day" is the key season for the breeding of pests and the elimination of diseases, and the prevention of spring and summer seasonal epidemics. Therefore, fighting this battle well is of great significance to doing a good job in this year's pest and disease eradication work.

The person in charge pointed out: The primary task of carrying out the health campaign during the "May Day" holiday is to take all effective measures to prevent the breeding and reproduction of "four pests" and control and eliminate factors leading to the spread of diseases. To this end, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to kill the four pests and eliminate their breeding conditions. In areas with more field mice, it is necessary to universally mobilize the masses to take effective measures to eliminate them as early as possible when mice emerge from hibernation. Efforts should also be made to eliminate sparrows before the branches and leaves of trees and crops become dense. More efforts should be focused on eliminating mosquitoes and flies. In addition to this, all localities should try their best to prevent and control prevalent infectious diseases.

Finally, the person in charge hopes that all localities will conduct a health inspection before "May Day." This will not only promote the current sanitation work, but also promote the sanitation movement for the whole year.

　　爱国卫生运动委员会号召
　　除害灭病迎“五一”
    新华社15日讯　中央爱国卫生运动委员会负责人关于在“五一”节前开展除害灭病运动，对本社记者发表谈话说：今春爱国卫生运动，由于紧密结合春季大生产等中心任务，动手早，配合好，抓得紧，行动快，收效显著。由于在运动中更加注意了治本的工作，大力进行了卫生工作的基本建设，消灭了许多越冬四害。运动中还进一步加强了集体福利事业的卫生工作，特别注意工农业生产中的劳动保护工作和劳逸安排，加强了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的卫生管理，普遍训练了炊事员、伙食管理员、保育员、接生员和保健员，大大提高了这些人员和广大群众的卫生知识水平，保障了人民的健康。在消灭疾病方面、防止冬春季急性传染病、寄生虫病和地方病等工作都取得了显著成绩。目前，运动正进入了干干净净迎接“五一”国际劳动节的突击高潮。
    负责人说：“五一”节前后四害开始孳生，是除害灭病、防止春夏季时疫的关键季节。因此，打好这一仗，对作好今年的除害灭病的工作有十分重要的意义。
    负责人指出：“五一”节开展卫生运动的首要任务，是要采取一切有效办法，不使“四害”孳生繁殖，控制并消灭疾病流行的因素。为此，必须抓住时机扑杀四害，清除其孳生条件。在野鼠较多的地区，要普遍发动群众，抓紧鼠类出蛰时，采取有效措施及早消灭。对麻雀，也要抓紧树木、庄稼枝叶还没有茂密以前，努力消灭。对蚊蝇更应集中力量消灭。除此，各地还要尽量防治流行的传染病。
    负责人最后希望各地在“五一”以前，进行一次卫生检查。这样，不仅能推动当前的卫生工作，对全年的卫生运动，也有促进作用。
