    Truth exists, so does falsehood. Lies don't last long. The Truth about the Tibetan Rebellion Comes to Light
    Dalai's Letters are True; The Interventionists' Hearts are Black
    People from all walks of life in Beijing express their feelings after reading Nehru's Mussoorie talks.
    (Reported by our newspaper) Yesterday, after workers in many factories in the capital, members of people's communes, teachers and students of schools, and people in religious circles saw in the newspaper that Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in Mussoorie on the 24th that the Dalai Lama told him that the several letters to General Tan Guansan were indeed true, they held meetings one after another, wrote big-character posters, and wrote letters to the newspaper, angrily denouncing the Indian expansionists' conspiracy to instigate the Tibetan rebellion, interfere in China's internal affairs, insult China's leaders, and undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    After seeing this news, workers and farmers unanimously believed that the truth about the armed rebellion in Tibet, the Dalai Lama's abduction, and the so-called Dalai Lama's statement had come to light, and the Indian expansionists' conspiracy had completely failed. Jin Zhongyi, a worker at the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, said angrily at a meeting: Now people all over the world have seen the despicable face of the Indian expansionists, and their conspiracy to interfere in our internal affairs is even more exposed. Song Yulin, an old worker at the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, cited various facts to question the Indian expansionists, saying, isn't the distribution of the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" by Indian diplomatic officials an interference in our internal affairs? Isn't your deliberate publication of the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" on the opening day of the National People's Congress aimed at undermining China's national unity and solidarity? Indian police condoned thugs insulting the image of our most beloved Chairman Mao in front of our consulate in Bombay. Isn't this blatant sabotage of Sino-Indian friendly relations? We warn the Indian expansionists that now is the time for you to sober up. Chen Yu, a breeder at the Fourth Station of the Heping People's Commune and a national model pig farmer, said that the Dalai Lama had no intention of leaving Lhasa six hours before leaving Lhasa. Isn't this proof that he was abducted? Since the Dalai Lama's three letters to General Tan Guansan are true, Nehru's past suspicions are groundless.
    Lama Boyun Wuerji, the steward of Yonghe Temple, said: The Tibetan rebellion was instigated by British imperialism and Indian expansionists. The truth of this conspiracy is now even clearer. Boyun Wuerji said: The Indian expansionists insist on saying that "Tibet is an independent country," which is a wild attempt to cover up the monstrous lie of undermining China's unification. Boyun Wuerji used the history of Yonghe Temple itself to illustrate that Tibet has been a member of the motherland's big family since ancient times. He said: Since Yonghe Temple was established 215 years ago, every abbot has been appointed by the Dalai Lama of Tibet. The current abbot, Kalazang, was sent by the Dalai Lama in 1957. If Tibet does not belong to our motherland's big family, how can there be such a relationship? Why can't the Dalai Lama appoint an abbot to the capital of another country?
    Gongga Minjiu, a Tibetan teacher at the Central University for Nationalities, who worked as a copyist in the Dalai's secretariat for two years, said that the three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan, judging from the handwriting, he could recognize at a glance that they were written by himself. This shows that the Dalai Lama was abducted and the so-called Dalai Lama's statement was imposed on him by Indian expansionists. Chen Guomei, a teacher in the Department of Education at Beijing Normal University, said that the facts prove that it is not we who told "Himalayan-like lies," but our justice has a power as great as the Himalayas. Liu Ding, deputy director of the International Law Teaching and Research Office of the Department of Law at Renmin University of China, said: The Dalai Lama's statement that the three letters he wrote to General Tan Guansan are true further exposes the conspiracy of Indian expansionists to interfere in China's internal affairs. They instigated the rebellion in Tibet and used their own territory—Kalimpong—as the command center for the Tibetan rebellion; Indian officials also directly distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." According to recognized principles of international law, inciting division and subversion against other countries and supporting traitors and bandits of other countries on one's own territory constitute interference in other countries. What is even more intolerable is that the thugs in Bombay actually insulted Chairman Mao Zedong. We know that a country condoning the insult of another country's leader in its own territory is an extremely unfriendly and extremely rude act towards that country, and I feel extremely indignant at this behavior.

### 有真就有假　谎话腿不长　西藏叛乱真相大白  达赖的信是真的　干涉者的心是黑的  北京各界读尼赫鲁穆索里谈话后纷纷发表感想

    有真就有假　谎话腿不长　西藏叛乱真相大白
    达赖的信是真的　干涉者的心是黑的
    北京各界读尼赫鲁穆索里谈话后纷纷发表感想
    本报讯　首都许多工厂的工人、人民公社的社员、学校的教师学生和宗教界人士，昨日看到报上所载印度总理尼赫鲁24日在穆索里说达赖喇嘛告诉他给谭冠三将军的几封信是确实的消息以后，又纷纷集会、写大字报、写信给报社，怒斥印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱、干涉我国内政、侮辱我国领袖和破坏和平共处五项原则的阴谋活动。
    工人和农民看到这个消息后，一致认为西藏武装叛乱，达赖喇嘛被劫持和所谓达赖喇嘛的声明的真相大白，印度扩张主义分子的阴谋完全破产了。北京第二棉纺织厂工人靳中义在集会上愤怒地说：这下子全世界人民都看到了印度扩张主义分子可耻的面目了，他们干涉我国内政的阴谋更加暴露了。石景山钢铁公司一高炉老工人宋玉林举出种种事实质问印度扩张主义分子说，印度外交官员散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这不是干涉我国内政是什么？你们故意在我国人民代表大会会议开幕的那天发表所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这不是蓄意破坏我国民族统一团结么？印度的警察纵容暴徒在孟买我国领事馆前侮辱我们最敬爱的毛主席的像，这不是明目张胆地破坏中印友好关系么？我们警告印度扩张主义分子，现在是你们应该清醒一下头脑的时候了。和平人民公社第四站饲养员、全国养猪模范陈玉说，达赖喇嘛在离开拉萨六小时以前还没有离开拉萨的想法，这还不是被劫持的证明么？达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信是真的，那么尼赫鲁过去的怀疑就毫无根据了。
    雍和宫的管家伯云乌尔吉喇嘛说：西藏的叛乱是由英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子所策动的，这个阴谋的真相，现在是更加清楚了。伯云乌尔吉说：印度扩张主义分子硬说什么“西藏是独立国”，这是妄图用来掩饰破坏我国统一的弥天大谎。伯云乌尔吉以雍和宫本身的历史说明西藏自古以来就是祖国大家庭中的一员。他说：雍和宫从二百一十五年前成立以来，每任住持僧都是由西藏达赖喇嘛委派的，现任住持喀拉藏就是达赖喇嘛在1957年派来的。如果西藏不属于我们祖国大家庭，怎么能有这样的关系呢？达赖喇嘛为什么不能委派住持僧到别国的首都去呢？
    中央民族学院藏族教员贡噶民久曾经在达赖秘书处作过两年抄写员的工作，他说达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信，从字迹上看，一眼就认得出是他自己写的，从这里就可以说明达赖喇嘛是被劫持的，所谓达赖喇嘛的声明是印度扩张主义分子强加在他身上的。北京师范大学教育系教师陈帼眉说，事实证明，不是我们说了“喜马拉雅山似的谎言”，而是我们的正义有着像喜马拉雅山那样大的力量。中国人民大学法律系国际法教研室副主任刘丁说：达赖喇嘛说他给谭冠三将军的三封信是真的，进一步暴露了印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的阴谋。他们策动了西藏的叛乱，并把自己的领土——噶伦堡作为西藏叛乱的指挥中心；印度官员还直接散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。根据公认的国际法准则，鼓动对其他国家进行分裂和颠复活动，支持在其本国领土上他国的叛国匪徒，这就构成了对他国的干涉。更不能令人容忍的是：孟买暴徒竟然侮辱毛泽东主席。我们知道，一国纵容在自己境地侮辱他国的领袖，是对他国极不友好和极端粗暴无理的行为，我对这种行为感到万分愤慨。（附图片）
