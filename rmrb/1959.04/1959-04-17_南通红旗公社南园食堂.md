	Delicious dishes, excellent systems.
	How to achieve such results? The masses use their hands and brains.
	Enjoying this meal, is it just for satisfying hunger?
	The collective spirit of the commune members greatly inspires us.

　　The Hongqi Commune was established in September of last year and now has 84 factories of various sizes and 85 cafeterias. The Nanyuan Cafeteria has grown from small to large, now feeding 600 people, and will soon be expanded. With the support of all parties, everyone uses their hands and brains, striving for thrift in everything, but the food is exquisite and diverse, which is pleasing. They grow their own vegetables, bamboo, raise fish, and raise pigs, basically requiring nothing from the outside. The dining room and kitchen are tidy and clean, truly achieving "six sides shining." Service personnel, regardless of men or women, put aside their own private affairs to work on the public affairs of the cafeteria, focusing solely on how to make the cafeteria better. We had lunch there, and everyone felt that they not only ate good food, but also received a good education.

    南通红旗公社南园食堂
    盘餐色色精，制度种种好。
    何以致此绩？群用手与脑。
    留此一餐饭，岂惟享甘饱？
    社员集体之精神，启迪我人良不少。
　　红旗公社去年9月间成立，现在有大小工厂八十四所，食堂八十五所。南园食堂从小到大，现在有六百人就食，不久还要扩充。得到各方面的支持，大家动手动脑，一切务求节俭，可是食品精美，多种多样，令人喜爱。自己种菜，种竹，养鱼，养猪，基本上不需外求。餐室和厨房整齐清洁，真正做到“六面光”。服务人员无论男女，都丢开自己的私事干食堂的公事，一心惟在怎样把食堂搞得更好。我们在那里进午餐，大家觉得不仅吃了好饭好菜，而且受了很好的教育。
