Eradicating the Yellow River Calamity and Benefiting Hundreds of Millions of People

The Yellow River flood, which has threatened the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the North China Plain for thousands of years, will be basically controlled next year. The Yellow River water, which harms the people, can also be used to irrigate vast farmlands, and its inexpensive electricity will greatly benefit the industrial development of nearby cities.

Speech by Representative Wang Huayun

Fellow Representatives:

I fully support the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am determined to implement them. Now I will talk about the issue of eradicating the Yellow River.

Since the Second Session of the First National People's Congress passed the "Resolution on the Comprehensive Plan for Eradicating the Yellow River Water Calamity and Developing the Yellow River Water Conservancy" in July 1955, great achievements have been made in the work of harnessing the Yellow River under the leadership of the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels. The year 1958 was also a year of overall Great Leap Forward in the work of harnessing the Yellow River, just like other construction undertakings. On the basis of the great victory of the rectification movement of the whole Party and the people, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, the enthusiasm of the broad masses for eradicating the Yellow River was unprecedentedly inspired. A magnificent people's Yellow River harnessing movement was launched from the main stream to the tributaries, from the high mountains to the plains. Large-scale reservoir projects are under construction on the main stream of the Yellow River, from Qinghai to Shandong. The world-famous Sanmenxia began construction as early as 1957. Large-scale projects such as Liujiaxia and Yanguoxia in Gansu Province, Qingtongxia in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Weishan in Shandong Province were all started last year. Large and medium-sized reservoir projects are being built on the major tributaries such as the Datong River, Tao River, Jing River, Wei River, Wuding River, Fen River, and Yi Luo River, and some small and medium-sized tributaries. Some are under construction, and some have already been completed. Fellow representatives, the original Yellow River plan stipulated that in the first phase of the project, the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia water conservancy hubs would be built on the main stream of the Yellow River, and the Qingtongxia, Dukoutang, and Taohuayu three very low water impounding dams would be built within fifteen years. Ten large reservoirs and five small reservoirs would be built on the tributaries of the Yellow River. At that time, we all thought this was a very magnificent plan, but less than five years have passed, and the projects that have been completed and are about to be completed have greatly exceeded the original plan in terms of scale, quantity, and time. This is truly a Great Leap Forward! It can be foreseen that after the completion of these projects one after another, they will play a great role in the development of industry and agriculture in the Yellow River Basin and in the cause of socialist construction. Sanmenxia is now rushing to build the dam body, and the civil construction project will be basically completed two years ahead of schedule in 1960. The relocation of reservoir residents is proceeding smoothly under the leadership of the provincial Party committees of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan. The Yellow River flood, which has threatened the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the North China Plain for thousands of years, will be basically controlled next year. The Yellow River water, which harms the people, can also be used to irrigate vast farmlands, and its inexpensive electricity will greatly benefit the industrial development of nearby cities. The benefits are endless. The reservoir can develop aquaculture, and ships can sail. There are also convenient conditions for building dams across the river and harnessing the river channel below Sanmenxia. A large number of talents have also been trained for water conservancy construction. In a word, the completion of Sanmenxia and the above-mentioned projects will inevitably change the face of the Yellow River and greatly accelerate socialist construction.

In the process of realizing cooperativization and people's communes, the irrigation projects in the Yellow River Basin have also developed rapidly. The original plan was to develop an irrigation area of ​​30 million mu within 15 years, but this target has been greatly exceeded. As of now, 17 large water diversion gates have been built and are about to be built in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. After the completion of the river-blocking water impounding dams and canal system projects and land leveling work, 80 to 100 million mu of farmland will be irrigated. This spring, Henan Province irrigated 15 million mu of wheat fields. These irrigated areas are still the main grain and cotton producing areas in Henan, Shandong, and Hebei, and play a major role in ensuring the completion of the state's grain and cotton planned targets. The irrigation area in the upper and middle reaches has also increased greatly, and has broken through the scope of river valley plains and developed towards plateaus and mountains. In particular, the creation of the majestic Gansu Province's water diversion project from the Tao River and Qinghai Province's water diversion project from the Datong River has opened up a path for transforming the face of arid areas.

In the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the central government cares about vigorously consolidating the dikes and strengthening the organizational leadership of flood control. Last July, an extraordinarily large flood occurred that was even larger than the one in 1933 (the flow rate at Huayuankou, Zhengzhou, was 22,300 cubic meters per second). The people of Henan and Shandong provinces, under the care of the central government and the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels and the support of the troops, launched a battle against the flood with an army of 2 million flood fighters. After ten days and nights of hard work, they finally overcame the flood and protected the agricultural harvest and the safety of industrial cities in vast areas. Compared with the flood in 1933 under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, which caused more than 50 breaches, affected a population of 3.64 million, and drowned more than 18,000 people, it eloquently illustrates the unparalleled superiority of our country's social system.

Soil and water conservation in the Yellow River Basin is an important measure for eradicating the Yellow River calamity. In recent years, under the leadership of the central government and local Party committees, great achievements and rich experience have been gained. As of March of this year, a preliminary control area of ​​200,000 square kilometers has been completed (110,000 square kilometers were completed in 1958), which is almost half of the total soil erosion area, and has played a great role in local agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry production. The people in mountainous areas believe that this is a road to get rid of poverty and become rich under the premise of realizing cooperativization and people's communes. At the same time, it has also begun to play a role in intercepting floods and sediment entering the river. According to preliminary data from last year's tests, the total amount of sediment in the Yellow River last year decreased by 10% compared with the past under similar conditions, and the total water volume decreased by 3%. Although this number is not accurate enough, it can show that soil and water conservation can indeed prevent soil erosion, slow down or eliminate the siltation of river channels, canals, and reservoirs, and make full use of the water conservancy resources of the Yellow River. In the future, we must continue to work hard, according to the "overall planning, comprehensive management, centralized management, and continuous management" policy of soil and water conservation work, and the effective combination of water conservancy and soil and water conservation, small-scale projects as the main focus, and the combination of large, medium, and small-scale projects, and the experience of transforming mountains into gardens, transforming gullies into streams, transforming slopes into terraced fields, and irrigating cultivated land. We must continue to work hard and strive to basically control soil erosion in the shortest possible time and build poor and remote areas into beautiful paradises.

The reason why the Yellow River harnessing work has achieved such brilliant achievements is the victory of the Party's general line for building socialism and the result of relying on the people to harness the river. We believe that after a considerable period of hard work, the grand plan to eradicate the Yellow River water calamity and develop the Yellow River water conservancy will surely be fully realized.

    根治黄河　造福亿民
    几千年来威胁华北平原亿万人民生命的黄河洪水，明年就可以得到基本控制，还可以把为害人民的黄水，灌溉广大农田，它的廉价的电力，大大有利于邻近城市的工业发展王化云代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告，并坚决贯彻执行，现在我谈一下根治黄河的问题。
    自从一九五五年七月第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过了“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划”的决议以来，治黄工作在中央和各级党委的领导下，已经获得了巨大成绩。一九五八年治黄工作也和各项建设事业一样是全面大跃进的一年，在全党全民整风运动获得伟大胜利的基础上，在党的建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，广大群众根治黄河的热情空前奋发，从干流到支流，从高山到平原，普遍展开了一个规模宏伟的人民治黄运动。在黄河干流上，从青海到山东，正在兴建着大型水库工程，世界著名的三门峡早于一九五七年施工。甘肃省的刘家峡、盐锅峡、宁夏回族自治区的青铜峡、山东省的位山等大型工程均于去年开工。在大通河、洮河、泾河、渭河、无定河、汾河、伊洛河等大支流和若干中小支流上兴建的大中型水库工程，有的正在兴修，有的已经完成。各位代表，原来黄河规划中拟定的第一期工程在十五年内黄河干流上修建三门峡、刘家峡两座水利枢纽，青铜峡、渡口堂、桃花峪三座很低的壅水坝。黄河支流上修建十座大型水库、五座小水库，那时我们都认为这是一个十分宏伟的规划，可是时间过了还不到五年，已经建成和即将建成的工程，不论在规模上，数量上，时间上都大大的超过了原来的规划，这真是一个大跃进啊！可以预见，在这些工程陆续完成之后，对黄河流域工农业的发展，社会主义建设事业，将起多么大的作用。现在三门峡正在紧张的赶筑坝体，土建工程将提前两年于一九六○年基本完成。水库居民的迁移工作，在陕西、山西、河南三省省委领导下顺利进行。几千年来威胁华北平原亿万人民生命的黄河洪水，明年就可以得到基本控制，还可把为害人民的黄水，灌溉广大农田，它的大量的廉价的电力，大大有利于邻近城市工业的发展，真是好处说不完，水库可以发展水产，航行轮船，三门峡以下修拦河坝，治理河道也有了便利条件，还为水工建培养了一大批人材。一句话三门峡和上述各项工程的完成，必然会改变黄河的面貌大大加速社会主义建设。
  在合作化和人民公社化的实现过程中黄河流域的灌溉工程也发展的很快，原规划中十五年内发展灌溉面积三千万亩，现在已经大大的超过了这个指标，截至目前，在黄河下游已经建成和即将建成的大型引水闸门十七座，在拦河壅水坝和渠系工程，土地平整工作，陆续完成之后，将能灌溉农田八千万至一亿亩，今春河南省即灌溉了麦田一千五百万亩，这些灌区还是河南、山东、河北的主要粮棉产区，对保证完成国家粮棉计划指标有重大作用。在上中游地区灌溉面积也有很大的增长，而且已突破了河谷川地的范围，向高原、山地发展，特别是气壮山河的甘肃省引洮工程和青海省的引大通河工程的创建，为改造干旱地区的面貌开辟了道路。
    在黄河下游，中央关怀大力巩固了堤防，加强了防汛的组织领导工作。去年七月发生了比一九三三年还大的特大洪水，（郑州花园口流量二万二千三百秒公方）河南、山东两省人民，在中央关怀、各级党委、政府的领导和部队的支援下，二百万防汛大军向洪水展开了搏斗，经过十昼夜的苦战，终于战胜了洪水，保卫了广大地区的农业丰收和工业城市的安全，这和国民党反动派统治下一九三三年洪水造成决口五十多处，受害人口三百六十四万，淹死一万八千余人相比，雄辩的说明了我国社会制度的无比优越性。
    黄河流域的水土保持工作是根治黄河的一项重要措施，几年来在中央和各地党委领导下，获得了巨大的成绩和丰富的经验。截至今年三月已完成初步控制面积二十万平方公里（一九五八年完成了十一万平方公里）差不多等于全部水土流失区的一半，对当地农、林、牧业生产，起了极大的作用，山区人民认为这是在合作化、人民公社实现的前提下，一条由穷变富的道路。同时对拦截洪水和泥沙进入河流，也开始发生作用，根据去年测验的初步资料，去年黄河的泥沙总量在相似的条件下比过去减少了百分之十，总水量减少了百分之三，这个数字虽然还不够准确，但可以说明水土保持确实能够防止水土流失，减缓或消除河道、渠道、水库的淤积现象，使黄河的水利资源得到充分利用。今后我们必须继续努力，根据“全面规划、综合治理、集中治理、连续治理”水土保持工作的方针，和行之有效的水利与水土保持相结合、小型为主，大、中、小型工程相结合，及山区园林化、沟壑川流化、坡地梯田化、耕地水利化等治山经验，继续鼓足干劲，力争在最短时期内基本上控制水土流失，把穷乡僻壤建设为美好的乐园。
    治黄工作所以获得这样辉煌的成就，是党的建设社会主义的总路线的胜利，是依靠人民群众治河的结果。我们相信再经过相当时间的努力，根除黄河水害开发黄河水利的宏伟规划，定能全部实现。
