　　Railway Straight Through Liangfeng Pass
　　By Our Correspondents Wu Zhenquan and Zhao Jialie

　　Travelers passing through Liangfeng Pass on the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway can see from afar a red flag fluttering in the wind amidst the lush greenery atop Cui Lü Bì Peak. The location of the red flag marks the center point of the Liangfeng Pass Tunnel on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, which is currently under construction. Tunnel workers excavating from both the north and south ends are vying for this banner of excellence five hundred meters deep inside the mountain.
　　Liangfeng Pass is a place name in the Lou Mountain main peak area of northern Guizhou. This mountain, over 1,500 meters above sea level, features continuous mountain ranges and overlapping peaks. Many people consider the Sichuan-Guizhou route a daunting journey, and many are amazed by the height and danger of the mountains here. Decades ago, when the rulers of old China oversaw the construction of the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, they succumbed to Liangfeng Pass, and the highway made seventy-two turns to climb the pass, creating a bizarre tale in the history of Chinese highway construction. Now, railway construction workers led by the Chinese Communist Party are commanding Liangfeng Pass to open its embrace and allow the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway line to pass straight through.
　　Constructing a railway is different from building a highway, especially when building a large tunnel, which is many times more complex and arduous. Inside Liangfeng Pass, this majestic mountain, there are accumulation layers, extremely hard rock layers, faults, karst caves, and underground rivers, making the geological conditions extremely complex. For the train to cross such a large mountain, it cannot climb seventy-two "zigzags" like a car. It needs to find a straight shortcut. A large number of railway engineering technicians and workers carried out precise measurements and explorations, and after repeated research, they abandoned the "zigzag" highway route and adopted a "straight" tunnel to pass directly through. Finally, the state approved the construction of a 4,270-meter tunnel, implementing the parallel pilot tunnel construction method.
　　The method of excavating a tunnel using parallel pilot tunnels is a first in the history of railway construction in our country. A parallel pilot tunnel means that when excavating a tunnel, a pilot tunnel similar to the main tunnel is simultaneously excavated on the left or right side of the main tunnel, not far away, at roughly the same horizontal level. This pilot tunnel is also excavated ahead of the main tunnel.
　　Why did the Liangfeng Pass Tunnel adopt the parallel pilot tunnel construction method? What are the benefits of using this construction method? This has attracted the interest of railway construction units across the country. Yang Guangxiao, the chief engineer in charge of the tunnel excavation, told reporters: The implementation of the parallel pilot tunnel construction method can play a geological exploration role. He said that although we have conducted detailed geological exploration work on the mountain in the construction section beforehand, we can still only provide rough data in the design; the actual geological conditions need to be explored during the construction of the parallel pilot tunnel. The strata through which this tunnel passes have relatively developed groundwater; with a parallel pilot tunnel, the water from the main tunnel can be drained into the parallel pilot tunnel, allowing normal construction of the main tunnel, and it can also serve as a permanent drainage channel.
　　The tunnel construction team tasked with this complex and arduous task has more than two thousand people. Since officially starting construction in December 1957, they have been fighting tirelessly with a four-shift work system every day and night. In the year and three months since then, the north and south ends have drilled more than three thousand meters into the heart of the mountain.
　　It was New Year's Day this year. In the morning, the cold wind carried drizzle, and the mountain tops were shrouded in thick fog. More than two thousand workers, excavating from the north and south entrances of the tunnel, gathered on the mountain top and planted a competition red flag at the center point of the tunnel, vowing to compete and strive to open the tunnel as soon as possible. The north entrance worker Long Chengyun's excavation team, carrying a new record of 9.6 meters of tunneling created from midnight to noon, came to the meeting and said: This year we must get the central red flag. The workers at the south entrance were not to be outdone, expressing their determination to exceed the center point and shake hands with their brothers at the north entrance. He Mingzhang's excavation team at the south entrance immediately put on their work clothes and threw themselves into the intense battle as soon as they came down from the oath-taking meeting. Long Chengyun and He Mingzhang are both famous drilling heroes. The teams they lead are also full of energy. In March of this year, Long Chengyun returned from attending the Sichuan Provincial Advanced Producer Representatives Conference. Hearing that the more than one hundred meters that the south entrance had overtaken last year had been almost caught up by his comrades who had stayed behind, he was excited and immediately threw himself into battle. However, because his excavation team was not directly responsible for the pilot tunnel excavation, in order to seize speed, with the consent of the Party branch, they supported the pilot tunnel excavation team with the best wind drill operators and the four best wind drills in their team; Long Chengyun led a group of novices and still beautifully completed the March task.
　　He Mingzhang, an A-grade advanced producer, is also a master of clever work. In the tunnel excavation projects of Lou Mountain, Dahebian, and other places, he created many construction methods such as drilling holes above and removing slag below, which played a significant role in the early opening of these tunnels. After he came to the south entrance of Liangfeng Pass in October last year, he led a temporarily assembled excavation team with weak technical strength, a shortage of steel drills, and stones that were sometimes soft and sometimes hard, coupled with the gushing of underground water, making it impossible to tunnel more than one meter per shift (six hours). This made him anxious. At this rate, when would they be able to open the tunnel! So he painstakingly studied and came up with many methods with everyone, and the work efficiency quickly improved, making him an advanced team at the south entrance. However, in the first quarter of this year, their advanced record was refreshed several times by other drilling heroes. In March of this year, despite the increase in pilot tunnel water, which brought difficulties to the construction, the red flag competition became even more intense. On the first day, He Mingzhang's team tunneled 2.4 meters and removed forty carts of slag, sending out good news; on the second day, Ou Zelin's team tunneled 2.6 meters and caught up; on the third day, Ma Tingyuan's team chased up fiercely, with a progress of 2.9 meters; on the fourth day, they broke through 3 meters; on the fifth day, they reached 3.2 meters and won the first five-day rotating red flag. But in the second five days, He Mingzhang's team won back the rotating red flag. The workers at the south entrance, under the leadership of two A-grade advanced producers—Captain Lou Xiaojun and Chief Engineer Fang Huaixiao—said goodbye to March and welcomed April in a lively competition climax. The workers at the north entrance were no less energetic. On the last day of last year, they were still one hundred and thirty-four meters behind the progress of the south entrance, but now they are almost catching up.
　　Liangfeng Pass, this strategic pass on the Sichuan-Guizhou route, is undergoing the transformation of drilling heroes. It has become iron proof, proving that Chinese railway construction workers are using their wisdom and labor to create railway construction miracles in the motherland.

　　铁道直穿凉风垭
　　本报记者　吴振全　赵家烈
    从川黔公路经过凉风垭的旅客，老远就可以看到翠绿碧峰顶绿丛中，高竖着一面迎风招展的红旗。红旗所在处，是正在修建的川黔铁路凉风垭隧道的中心点；从南北两面向中心开挖的隧道工人，正在五百公尺的深处，抢夺这面优胜红旗。
    凉风垭是黔北娄山主峰地带的一个地名。这个山，海拔一千五百多公尺，群山连绵，峰峦重叠。许多人都把川黔之道视为畏途，许多人到这里都惊叹山高路险。数十年前，旧中国的统治者主持修川黔公路时，就屈服在凉风垭面前，公路线拐了七十二道拐，才爬上了凉风垭，制造了中国公路建设史上的一个奇闻。现在，中国共产党领导的铁路建设职工，却喝令凉风垭敞开胸怀，让川黔铁路线直穿过去。
    修建铁路和建筑公路不同，特别是修建大隧道，更不知复杂艰巨多少倍。在凉风垭，这个巍峨的大山内部，有堆积层、有特坚岩层、有断层、有溶洞、有暗河，地质情况非常复杂。火车要越过这样的大山，就不像汽车那样爬上七十二个“之”字，需要寻找一条笔直的捷径，大批铁道工程技术人员和工人进行精密的测量和钻探，并经过反复的研究，还是抛开“之”形的公路线，采取“一”字形的隧道，直穿而过。最后由国家批准修隧道四千二百七十公尺，实行平行导坑的施工方法。
    开挖隧道采用平行导坑方法，在我国铁道建设史上还是第一次。平行导坑，就是在开挖一个隧道时，在这个隧道的左面或右面的不远处，在大致相同的水平线上，同时开挖一个类似隧道的导坑，这个导坑还要开在隧道的前面。
    凉风垭隧道为什么要采用平行导坑施工方法？采用这种施工方法有什么好处？这曾吸引了全国铁路施工单位的兴趣，主持这座隧道开挖的杨光烋总工程师告诉记者：实行平行导坑的施工方法，可以起地质勘探作用。他说，我们对施工地段的大山，虽然事前经过了详细的地质勘探工作，仍只能提供一个设计中的概略数据；实际的地质情况需要靠平行导坑施工中来探明，这个隧道所通过的地层，地下水比较发达；有了平行导坑可以把隧道的水排入平行导坑，使隧道正常施工，并且可以作为永久的排水道。
    担任修建这个复杂而艰巨的任务的隧道建设队伍有二千多人。从1957年12月间，正式施工进硐以来，他们一直以每昼夜四班工作制，日夜不息地战斗着。在这一年零三个多月的时间里，南北两端已向大山的腹心钻进了三千多公尺。
    还是今年元旦的事。早晨，寒风夹着细雨，山头披着浓雾。分别从隧道南北两口挖进的二千多名职工，集聚在山头，在隧道中心点插上竞赛红旗，誓师比武，立志早日打通这座隧道。北口的工人龙成云开挖工班，带着从零时起到十二时止创造掘进九点六公尺的新纪录，来到大会上说：今年我们一定要把中心红旗拿到手。南口的工人更不示弱，表示要争取超过中心点，与北口兄弟握手会师。南口贺明章开挖工班，从誓师会上一下来，马上穿上工作服，投入了紧张的战斗。龙成云和贺明章都是有名的钻山猛将。他们领导的工班也都一个个生龙活虎。今年3月，龙成云出席四川省先进生产者代表大会回来，听到去年被南口拉下的一百多公尺，已被留家的同伴快要追上了，兴奋得立即投入战斗。但由于他的开挖工班没有直接担负导坑掘进的任务，为了抢速度，在党总支的同意下，他们把本班最好的风钻手，四台最好的风钻，支援了导坑开挖工班；龙成云领着一批新手，仍然漂漂亮亮地完成了3月份的任务。
    贺明章这个甲等先进生产者，也是一个善于巧干的角色。他在娄山关、大河边等隧道开挖工程中，曾经创造了上面打眼、下面出渣等许多施工方法，对这些隧道的提前打通起到了很大作用。去年10月他来到凉风垭南口后，领导了一个临时凑成的开挖工班，技术力量较弱，钢钎缺乏，石质时软时硬，加上地下水涌，每个小班（六小时）掘进不到一公尺。这可把他急坏了。这样的进度，哪年才能挖通啊！于是他苦心钻研，和大家一起想出了许多办法，工效迅速提高，成为南口的先进工班。但是，在今年的第一季度内，他们的先进纪录曾被其他的钻山英雄刷新了几次。在今年3月里，尽管导坑水量增加，给施工带来了困难，但是红旗竞赛运动却更加猛烈。第一天，贺明章工班掘进二公尺四，出渣四十车，传出了捷报；第二天，欧泽林工班掘进二公尺六，赶到了前面；第三天，麻廷元工班猛追上来，进度二公尺九；第四天闯过三公尺；第五天达到三公尺二，夺得了第一个五天的流动红旗。可是在第二个五天，贺明章工班又把流动红旗夺了回来。南口的职工们就这样在两位甲等先进生产者——队长楼校均、总工程师方怀孝的领导下，在热火朝天的竞赛高潮中送走了3月，迎来了4月。北口的职工干劲分毫不差。去年的最后一天，他们比南口还差一百三十四公尺的进度，可是现在已经快追平了。
    凉风垭，这个川黔道上的雄关铁岭，正在经受着钻山英雄们的改造。它已成了铁的证据，证明着中国铁道建设职工正用自己的智慧和劳动，在祖国创造着铁路建设的奇迹。
