　　What kind of mother, what kind of children.
                                    ——Uyghur Proverb

    People often say: "The warmest thing in the world is a mother's heart." I say, in the capital, you can feel a heart as warm as a mother's everywhere.

    As soon as you walk into a department store, several kind smiles will immediately gather on your face with a warm spring breeze. No matter which counter you approach, a kind voice will ring in your ear: "Comrade, what would you like?" They will pile the goods in front of you, let you choose, let you ask, carefully select each item for you, and explain each question in detail. If you don't like any of them, they will suggest to you: "Comrade, please go to ×× place to have a look."

    Comrades, the conductors on trams and buses, they run up and down the bus all day long, tirelessly reminding passengers not to take the wrong route; if you want to transfer, they will tell you in detail the bus number you should transfer to. They help the elderly get on and off the bus, and explain the direction and station to those who are new to the area. They also ask people to give up their seats to the elderly. In the previous period, the bus even provided you with a towel to wipe your face, and even performed Kuaiban and sang songs for you!

    When eating in a restaurant, the service comrades are as enthusiastic as if they were receiving a relative, patiently explaining the contents of each dish, and suggesting dishes for you to eat quickly. After the dishes have been served, they are still diligently circling around you, constantly asking you: "Do you need anything else?" "Eat slowly, don't rush," "Is the soup cold? I'll heat it up for you."... When you are about to leave, they say with a smile: "Put on your clothes, sit for a while before leaving, be careful not to catch a cold."...

    Listen, all of this sounds just like a loving mother's caring voice ringing in your ears!

    Every time I buy something and walk out of a store, eat a meal and walk out of a restaurant, buy a few books or magazines and walk out of a bookstore, I am shocked by the warm hearts of these kind people. My heart throbs for a long time, like drinking a glass of grape wine, my blood is burning all over my body, and I feel so comfortable and excited that I am immersed in endless happiness.

    When I return to the dormitory or wake up from a dream, I still savor these radiant faces. Their warm feelings make me unable to forget them for a long time.

    Feeling this kind of warmth in the new society makes people can't help but think of the situation in the old society: at that time, an ordinary old man, an ordinary worker, had to taste so much suffering and hear so many cold words! The wealth obtained by exploitation made those rulers so arrogant that they did not take people seriously. Ethnic minorities suffered even more.

    But now, every corner of the motherland is filled with maternal warmth and brotherly friendship. Especially if they know you are from a minority ethnic group, they will treat you with extra kindness and sincerity. Even those unconventional special considerations will make you feel embarrassed. "All men are brothers within the four seas," this saying has been circulating for a long time, but in fact, it is truly embodied in the new society.

    The day before yesterday, my wife came from Xinjiang "Thousands of miles away, I hope you take care." In fact, in the big family of the motherland, there is warmth everywhere, and there are relatives caring for you everywhere.

    I often ponder with all my mind: What kind of power motivates them to do this? Why do they do this? And so naturally, so sincerely. Is it because they get paid more than others? Or to attract more customers to the store? The only conclusion I can find is that the milk of education from our great Party has nurtured them, because they all have a red-hot heart dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly.

    Don't we Uyghurs have a proverb? "What kind of mother, what kind of children." Look, these are the excellent children cultivated by our great mother, the Communist Party of China. From them, I felt the warmth of the motherland, saw a glorious page of the motherland in the leap forward epic, and tasted the beautiful fruits of the Great Leap Forward.

    What could be happier than living in the socialist new society? What could be more glorious than being a citizen of the People's Republic of China?

    These days, we are all indignant at the traitorous acts of the reactionary upper strata in Tibet. Their evil conspiracy is to try to pull the broad masses of working people out of the embrace of the motherland and drag them into the dark and cruel hell that will forever be spurned by the people. They also vainly try to treat the people as cattle and horses. Think about it: who would want to go from the paradise of happiness to the fiery stove of hell to suffer? The people of all ethnic groups in China have long recognized the path they should take. On their broad avenue of advancement, the light of the Communist Party of China is shining brightly. Even if a small group of rebels try in vain to cover up this light with their lapels, the people will never lose their way.

    If all the trees in the world were turned into pens
    If all the water in the world were turned into ink
    Still, we couldn't write enough,
    Of the Communist Party's kindness.

    This folk song, which has been popular among the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for several years, is still so fresh and vibrating in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang today.

    Motherland, dear mother, motherland, the cradle of happiness for all ethnic groups! We will always follow you closely, and we will always protect you as we protect our own eyes. Even a rock or a handful of soil of yours, we are willing to mark it, circle around it like an eagle, protect it, and never let any enemy touch it.

　　温暖
　　维吾尔族　尤·赫捷耶夫
　　什么样的母亲，就有什么样的儿女。
                    ——维吾尔谚语
    人常说：“世界上最温暖的莫过于母亲的心。”我说，在首都，到处都能感到像母亲的心一样温暖的心。
    当你刚一走进一个百货商店时，立刻有几张和蔼的笑容，满面春风地会聚集在你的脸上，不论你走近那个柜台旁边，一个亲切的声音就在你的耳旁响着：“同志，要什么？”他们会把这些东西堆满在你的眼前，任你挑选、任你询问，为你挑选每一种货物，细心地解释每一个问题。要是都不中意，他们就会向你建议：“同志，请您再到××地方去看一看。”
    电车和公共汽车售票员同志们，他们整日在车上跑上跑下，为了乘客不走错路线，不倦地提醒乘客；你如果要转车，他们不厌其详地告诉你应转的车号，遇到老年人就搀扶他们上下车，遇到人生地疏的人则给他们解释应去的方向和车站。招呼给老年人让坐。在前一个时期，车子里还给你擦脸的手巾，还要给你说快板、唱歌哩！
    在饭馆里吃饭，服务员同志们像接待一个亲人一样地热情，耐心地解释着每一样饭菜的内容，替你为吃快出的饭菜而出主意。饭菜已经端来了，他们还殷勤地周旋在你的身旁，不时地问你：“还要什么？”“慢慢地吃、别慌，”“汤冷了吧，我替你热一下去。”……要走了，他们又笑嘻嘻说：“把衣服穿好，坐会儿再走，小心着凉了。”……
    听，这一切，多么像一个慈母关切的声音在你的耳旁响着啊！
    每当我买一件东西走出商店，吃一顿饭走出饭馆，买几本书或杂志走出书店，我被这些善良的人们的温暖的心所震撼着，我的心久久不能平静地激荡着，像喝了杯葡萄美酒似的，血液在周身燃烧，心情是那么舒畅、那么激动，使我沉浸在无限的幸福感中。
    当我回到宿舍里来或是夜梦初醒，我还是回味着这一张一张光彩的脸。他们温暖的心情使我久久不能忘怀。
    感受到新社会的这种温暖，使人又不禁想起旧社会的情景来：在那时候，一个普通的老百姓，普通的劳动者，要尝尽多少苦楚，要听得多少冷言冷语呀！剥削得来的财富使那些统治者那样地骄横，不把人放在眼里。少数民族，更是苦难重重。
    而现在呢，祖国的每个角落都充满了母性的温暖和兄弟般的友谊。特别要是他们知道了你是少数民族时，那对待你又是分外地亲切恳勤，甚至那些破格的特殊地照顾，倒会弄得你自己尴尬起来。“四海之内皆兄弟”这一句话，虽然是老早就传说的，但其实，真正是在新社会才得到体现的。
    前天，我的妻子从新疆来“远隔千里，希多保重。”其实，在祖国的大家庭里，处处都是温暖，处处都有亲人亲切的关怀。
    我常费尽神思地思索着：究竟是什么力量促使他们这样？他们为什么要这样？而且那么自然，那么真诚。是因为工资比别人拿的多吗？还是为了给商店多招揽几个顾客吗？我找出的答案的结论只有一条，就是我们伟大的党教育的奶汁哺育了他们，是因为他们都有一颗全心全意为人民服务的赤裸裸地火热的心。
    我们维吾尔族不是有句谚语吗？“什么样的母亲，就有什么样的儿女。”，瞧，这就是我们伟大的母亲——中国共产党培育下的优秀儿女们。我从他们的身上感到了祖国的温暖，看到了祖国在大跃进诗篇中光辉的一页，尝到了大跃进美好的果实。
    还有什么比生活在社会主义的新社会更为幸福呢？还有什么比做一个中华人民共和国的公民更为光荣的呢？
    我们这些日子，都为西藏的反动上层集团的叛国行为而愤慨。他们的罪恶阴谋，就是企图把广大的劳动人民从祖国的怀抱里拉出来，拖入那永远被人民唾弃的黑暗冷酷的地狱里去，他们还妄想把人民当牛马骑。试想想看：谁愿意从幸福的天堂到地狱的火灶里受罪去，中国各族人民早已认清了自己应走的道路，在他们宽敞的前进大道上，中国共产党的光芒在明朗地照耀着，纵然有一小撮叛乱分子徒劳无益地尝试用衣襟遮住这个光芒，但是，人民绝对不会迷失方向。
    普天下的树变成笔
    普天下的水变成墨
    也写呀写不完，
    共产党的恩情。
    这个流行在新疆各族人民之间的民歌，虽然已经唱了好几年，但在今天，它依然还是那么新鲜，那么震荡着新疆各族人民的心。
    祖国啊，可爱的母亲，祖国啊，各族人民幸福的摇篮！我们将永远紧跟着您走，我们永远维护您像维护我们自己的眼睛一样，即或是您的一块岩石、一撮土，我们也愿意标上记号，像雄鹰一样地盘旋着它，保护着它，绝不让任何的敌人碰它一下。
