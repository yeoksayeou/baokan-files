I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the reports of other leaders. I will study diligently, transform myself, and strive to participate in the great socialist construction.

Inspections are an excellent opportunity for us during the socialist construction period to recognize new things and generate new ideas. I visited several people's communes in Zhejiang Province and saw how this organization liberated a great deal of labor, especially women, to engage in agricultural production, becoming a major reason for the great leap forward in our country's agriculture. But speaking of both Shanghai and Zhejiang together, in this brief speech, I would first like to report some thoughts on the industrial leap forward.

First is the question of how to supply the electricity needed for industrialization in Shanghai and Zhejiang. Shanghai has become an important industrial base in our country and is continuing to develop. Zhejiang Province is also advancing rapidly. At present, the electricity supply is felt to be insufficient, and appropriate increases are necessary. As far as I know, hydroelectric and thermal power construction are being actively promoted.

In terms of hydropower, I went to see the magnificent Xin'an River Power Station south of the Yangtze River. This station is located in Tongguan Gorge, and the design and construction were all undertaken by our country, and the construction and power generation equipment were all manufactured by our country. Nine generators will be installed, each with a capacity of 72,500 kilowatts, for a total capacity of 652,500 kilowatts. The investment per kilowatt is only 383 yuan, which is almost half the investment of thermal power. The water source is abundant, and the cost of electricity generation is only one-eighth of that of thermal power. The original plan was to generate electricity in 1961, but it has been brought forward several times and is now scheduled to begin generating electricity on National Day this year. This wonderful and rapid project can only be realized under the socialist system; it would not be possible in a capitalist country. Moreover, the comrades at Xin'an River have decided to build a new hydropower station at Qililong on the Qiantang River, with a capacity of 360,000 kilowatts. Together, these two plants will add one million kilowatts of cheap electricity to the Shanghai and Zhejiang area. In addition, power supplies from the Ou River and tidal power are not yet included in the calculation. In terms of thermal power, in addition to the existing Wangting stations in Shanghai, there are also Minhang and other stations, with a total capacity also exceeding one million kilowatts. These interconnected hydro and thermal power stations will be fully capable of meeting the industrial needs of the Shanghai and Zhejiang areas.

Establishing power stations requires the independent manufacturing of power generation equipment. Factories in Northeast China already have the capacity to supply large-scale hydraulic turbine generators. Shanghai takes the lead in manufacturing equipment for thermal power stations. I happily visited the newly built Minhang Turbine Factory and Motor Factory. Generators have leapt from 6,000 and 12,000 kilowatts to 25,000 kilowatts last year. This year, there is even greater progress, with each set of 50,000 kilowatts being manufactured, and preparations are being made to add 100,000 kilowatts to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day. In 1957, a total of 125,000 kilowatts of steam turbine generators were completed. In 1958, this jumped to 521,000 kilowatts, and this year, the goal is to reach 2 million kilowatts. Electric motors and transformers have also made considerable leaps. All parts have been greatly reorganized and improved, with three checks and four comparisons, and are advancing courageously. The value of each worker's output was 25,000 yuan the year before last, 40,000 yuan last year, and will be even higher this year. The main equipment of these two factories is supplied by Czechoslovakia, and it is extremely sophisticated. We are deeply fortunate to have the help of the Soviet Union and the advanced experience of the people's democratic countries. The superiority of socialist construction and the outstanding abilities of our leaders, technicians, and working masses are all clearly displayed before us, and no one can fail to be sincerely happy and inspired.

Second is the development of the steel industry. Before liberation, Shanghai had almost no steel mills. After liberation, a few were built, and only last year did they leap forward at a high speed. I visited Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5, and the Xin'hu Steel Plant, which specializes in steel rolling. Shanghai's machinery manufacturing industry is very developed and requires a lot of steel, so it is necessary to produce steel in large quantities locally. Shanghai's factories responded to this need, and this year's steel production target has been raised from 1.2 million tons to 2 million tons. The question is how to supply pig iron. The main source is pig iron smelted by local methods in various places. Last year, the whole people smelted iron, and small blast furnaces sprang up like mushrooms, producing a large amount of crude iron. The composition of the crude iron is not up to the standard of new-style blast furnace products, especially the sulfur content is too high, making it difficult to refine into good steel. Many factories in Shanghai have worked hard and conducted many experiments to solve this problem. They use appropriate materials in the cupola furnace and alkaline converter to burn off the sulfur in the crude iron and refine it into qualified steel products. This is a good example of the great effectiveness of walking on two legs in our country. Pig iron is widely produced through mass movements, and good steel is refined through technological revolution. The Government Work Report mentioned both foreign and indigenous methods, and also mentioned the combination of foreign and indigenous methods. This is indeed an important policy to promote the great leap forward in our country's industrial production.

Third is the importance of Shanghai's industrial base in the national industrial development. Before liberation, Shanghai was the center of imperialist aggression. After liberation, the forces of imperialism were swept away, and our people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, worked diligently to build. In a few years, Shanghai has transformed from a consumer market into a production base that is very important for both heavy and light industry. What an amazing and gratifying phenomenon this is! It is well known that Shanghai's factory equipment, especially in heavy industry, is not the best in the country. The output of factories in the Northeast often exceeds that of Shanghai. However, Shanghai's work efficiency is excellent, it has the ability to bring into play the effectiveness of technological innovation, and it also has the ability to solve the problems caused by raw materials. The result of the anti-rightist rectification campaign has universally improved the style of being both red and expert in factories. When I heard the Jiangnan Shipyard report that more than 1,000 workers originally received piece-rate wages, exceeding the general wage by 28%, and voluntarily requested cancellation during last year's rectification to avoid affecting unity, this communist style is truly admirable.

The interior of our country lacks an industrial base and urgently needs assistance from advanced regions. Shanghai is responsible for this task of supporting various places. Zhejiang Province is an example. Zhejiang originally lacked modern factories and has only begun to build them in recent years. Look at the semi-mountainous areas, where steel mills, machine factories, boiler factories, bearing factories, oxygen generator factories, etc. are being earnestly constructed. The experience gained from installing machines and equipment cannot be separated from Shanghai. Everyone recognizes that Shanghai's development is the source of Zhejiang's construction.

Of course, the inspection gave me close contact and understanding of some specific cases, but we must recognize that our country's great leap forward is an all-round advance. The whole country is a chessboard, and industry, agriculture, transportation, and communication, as well as culture and education, are all moving forward. In this conference, Premier Zhou's Government Work Report gave us very correct instructions. The national economic plan for 1959 proposed by the government allows us to see that our country's socialist construction is progressing at an unparalleled speed. Before liberation, our country did not have a socialist system, so the people were poor and the country was weak, and there was no cure. After liberation, with the leadership of the Party, and through socialist revolutionary movements such as land reform and the three major transformations, a good foundation was prepared. Then, when the time was right, the Party led the whole country, with soaring energy, mass movements, and technological revolution, to implement the general line of socialist construction, thereby creating an unprecedentedly large amount of production. Because there was the first five-year plan, there could be the great leap forward of 1958. Because we gained the experience of 1958, we can continue to grow and increase and have the great leap forward of 1959. From this, it can be seen that the great leap forward plan proposed by the Party and the government is not a figment of the imagination, but is realistic and based on facts, so its implementation will definitely be successful. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao, our country is advancing at a speed of one day equals twenty years, entering an era of unprecedented prosperity and glory.

I would also like to explain my opinion on the recent development of the rebellion in Tibet. The armed rebellion in Tibet was only the act of a small number of upper-level reactionary elements, which violated the interests of the Tibetan people and has now been completely quelled. These rebellious elements, colluding with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, betrayed the motherland, and their crimes are obvious and destined to fail. However, a small handful of them have also kidnapped the Dalai Lama, resided in India, and, under the protection of the Indian government, published rumors that defame the motherland and undermine unity, which makes us feel confused and indignant about the intentions of the Indian side. India itself is a multi-ethnic country, which recently broke away from the colonial status of the British Empire, and it should be easy to understand the actual situation in our country. After our country was liberated, India quickly recognized it and first signed an agreement on peaceful coexistence with our country. We value this friendship. Given this, there is no reason for the Indian political circles to turn around and repeat the old tune of imperialism, expressing sympathy and comfort to the Tibetan rebels. Can this be considered non-interference in our country's internal affairs? Can this be considered in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence? The people of our country do not want an inch of foreign territory, nor will they allow any foreign forces to expand into our territory. We cannot but ask certain politicians in India to quickly wake up and stop the dream of unreasonable interference.

    视察上海和浙江工业的一些感想
    翁文灏委员的发言
    我衷心拥护周总理所作的“政府工作报告”和其他领导人的报告，我当用心学习，改造，努力参加伟大的社会主义建设。
    视察是我们在社会主义建设期内认识新事物和启发新思想的极好机会。我在浙江省内看了几个人民公社，见到这种组织把许多劳动力，尤其妇女，解放出来，担任农业生产，成为我国农业大跃进的一个重大原因。但就上海和浙江一起来讲，在这简短发言内，我愿首先报告对于工业跃进方面的一些感想。
    第一是上海和浙江工业化所需的电力如何供应问题。上海已成为我国一个重要工业基地，正在继续发展。浙江省也正向前猛进。目前电力都感不足，适当增加是必要的。就我所知，水电和火电建设工作都正在积极推进。
    水电方面，我曾往看长江以南规模宏壮的新安江电站。这站设在铜官峡，设计与施工全由我国自任，建筑和发电设备全由我国自造。发电机将设九台，每台七万二千五百瓩，全部容量六十五万二千五百瓩。每瓩投资仅为三百八十三元，比火电投资减轻几乎一半。水源丰富，发电成本只有火电八分之一。发电原定一九六一年，迭次提前，定于本年国庆日开始发电。这种美妙而迅速的工程只有社会主义的制度下才能实现，在资本主义国家是不会有的。而且新安江工作同志已决定在钱塘江七里垅新建水电站，容量三十六万瓩。这两个厂联合起来将为上海浙江地区增加廉价电力一百万瓩。此外瓯江和潮水供电都还未计算在内。火电方面，除现有上海望亭各站外，还有闵行等站，合计容量也将超过一百万瓩。这些水、火电站连贯起来，供应沪、浙地区的工业需要是足可胜任的。
    建立电站必须自行制造发电设备。我国大型水轮发电机已有东北工厂力能供应。火电站所用设备则以上海制造褒然居首。我曾愉快地参观了崭新建设的闵行汽轮机厂和电机厂。发电机已从六千和一万二千瓩跃进为去年的二万五千瓩。今年更为跃进，在造每套五万瓩，准备加制十万瓩，来迎接第十周年的国庆。一九五七年共成汽轮发电机十二万五千瓩，一九五八年跃进到五十二万一千瓩，今年要达到二百万瓩。电动机变压机都有相当跃进。各部分大整大改，三查四比，勇猛前进。每一工人产值前年二万五千元，去年四万元，今年将更加高。这两个厂主要设备由捷克斯洛伐克供给，极为精良，我国得苏联和人民民主各国先进经验的帮助，是深可庆幸的。社会主义建设的优越性和我国领导人、技术员和劳动群众的卓越能力都显然展开在我们面前，没有一个人会不衷心地欢欣鼓舞的。
    第二是钢铁工业的发展问题。解放前上海几乎没有钢铁厂，解放后稍有建置，到去年才以高速率跃进。我曾参观上钢一厂、上钢五厂和专任轧钢的新沪钢铁厂。上海机械制造工业很发达，需钢很多，就地大量产钢是必要的。上海各厂响应这个需要，今年产钢指标从一百二十万吨提高到二百万吨。问题是如何供应生铁。主要来源是靠各地所炼的土法生铁。去年全民炼铁，小高炉风起云涌，所出土铁数量很多，土铁成分比不上新式高炉的标准产品，尤其含硫太高，不容易炼成好钢。上海好些工厂煞费苦心，经过许多试验，才解决这个问题。他们在化铁炉和碱性转炉内，使用适当材料，便能烧掉土铁的硫份，炼成合格钢品，这是我国两条腿走路大显功效的一个良好实例。用群众运动来广产生铁，又由技术革命来炼成好钢。政府工作报告内提到洋土并举，又提到洋土结合。这实在是促使我国工业生产大跃进的一个重要政策。
    第三是上海工业基地在全国工业发展中的重要性。解放前，上海是帝国主义侵略势力的中心地，解放后帝国主义力量一扫而光，我国人民在共产党和毛主席领导下勤奋建设。在少数年内，上海已从已往的消费市场一变而成为重工业和轻工业都很重要的生产基地。这是何等惊人而可喜的现象！明知上海工厂设备，尤在重工业方面，并不是全国最好的地方。东北各厂的分量往往超过上海。但上海工作效率是优良的，有能力发挥技术革新的功效，又有能力解决原材料所引起的问题。反右整风的结果使工厂内又红又专的作风普遍提高，当我听到江南造船厂报告，有一千多工人原来收计件工资，超过一般工资百分之二十八，去年整风时自请取消，以免影响团结，这种共产主义风格，真足引人钦佩。
    我国内地各处缺少工业基础，极需先进地区的援助。上海就负有这种支援各处的任务。浙江省便是实例。浙江原缺乏现代工厂，近几年来才开始建设。试看半山区内，钢铁厂、机器厂、锅炉厂、轴承厂、制氧机厂等正在认真建设。所装机器和装置使用的经验都离不开上海，大家认识，上海的发展便是浙江建设的源泉。
    当然，视察使我取得若干具体事例的亲切接触和了解，但我们必须认识我国大跃进是一个全面猛进。全国一盘棋，工业农业，运输交通以及文化教育莫不在向前迈进。在这次会议中，周总理的政府工作报告给我们以十分正确的指示。政府所提一九五九年度国民经济计划使我们看到我国社会主义建设正在以无可比拟的速度向前进展。解放以前，我国没有社会主义制度，所以民穷国衰，无可救药。解放后，得到党的领导，经过土地改革，三大改造等社会主义革命运动，准备成了良好基础，那便到了适当时候，由党领导全国，用冲天干劲，群众运动，技术革命，实行社会主义建设总路线，因而造成空前无比的大量生产。因为有了第一个五年计划，所以能有一九五八年的大跃进，因为得到一九五八年的经验，所以能继长增高有一九五九年的大跃进。从此可见党和政府所提大跃进计划，不是凭空悬想，而是实事求是，确有根据，所以实行起来，一定会成功的。我们深信，我国在伟大的党和毛主席领导下，正在一天等于二十年的速度，进到史无前例的繁盛光荣的时代。
    我还要说明我对西藏叛变最近演进的意见。西藏武装叛变只是少数上层反动分子的行为，违反西藏民族的利益，现在已完全荡平了。这些叛乱分子，勾结帝国主义、蒋匪帮，背叛祖国，罪恶昭彰，注定是要失败的。可是他们一小撮人，还劫持达赖喇嘛，居住印度，在印度政府庇护之下，发表诽谤祖国和破坏统一的谣言，这就使我们对于印度方面的用意，感到迷惑和愤慨。印度自身是一个多民族的国家，新近脱离英帝国殖民地的地位，对于我国的实际情况，应当容易认识。我国得到解放后，印度迅速承认，并与我国首先订定和平共处的协定，这种友情，我们是看重的，既然如此，印度政治界万没有理由，反过头来，重弹帝国主义旧调，对西藏叛乱分子表示同情与安慰。这能算不干涉我国内政吗？这能算符合和平共处的原则吗？我国人民不要外国一寸领土，也决不容许任何外国势力扩张到我国的领土。我们不能不要求印度某些政治家快速清醒头脑，停止无理干涉的迷梦。
