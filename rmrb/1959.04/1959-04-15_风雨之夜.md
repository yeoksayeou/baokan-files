　　A Windy and Rainy Night
　　By Our Correspondent Ouyang Xian
    Deep in the night, members of the First Production Team of the Liaoshi Brigade, Liaoshi Commune, Zixing, Hunan, were sleeping soundly.

    Suddenly, a howling north wind sprang up outside the window, and the sound of rain pattering on the roof tiles startled the members. The temperature quickly dropped to around ten degrees Celsius. Everyone understood the seriousness of the situation: the rice seeds in the more than fifteen mu of early rice seedling fields had only been sown for four or five days, just sprouting and starting to leaf out. How could they withstand such a cold wave! All of the team's more than 140 young and middle-aged members, along with some older members, quickly got up and, braving the wind and rain, waged a tenacious battle against the cold wave. With the wind and rain raging, the gas lanterns wouldn't light. People lit pine torches and spread load after load of fire-soil ash onto the seedlings. But with such a strong wind, people could barely keep their rain capes on. How could the ash land? The fire-soil ash was blown away by the strong wind. Just as the members were getting anxious, the voice of Zhou Jiming, the Commune Party Secretary, rang out from the crowd: "Comrades! Stay calm. With such strong wind and rain, spreading fire-soil ash won't work. Quickly bring boards, bamboo mats, and tobacco clips to build frames and cover the seedlings!" He was barefoot, his trouser legs rolled high, and rainwater streamed down his body. At 10:00 PM, Secretary Zhou had just returned to the commune from a meeting at the production team when he received an urgent notice from the County Party Committee saying that there would be a strong wind that night, the temperature would drop to zero, and there might even be hail. As soon as he heard this news, he forgot his day's fatigue and asked the comrades in the office to immediately call each brigade and quickly mobilize all members to do everything possible to protect the seedlings. He grabbed his rain cape, put on his raincoat, and rushed to the First Production Team of Liaoshi Brigade, where there were the most early rice seedlings.

    Secretary Zhou's appearance greatly encouraged the members. "Secretary Zhou is right!" The members, full of confidence, all went home to carry bamboo mats, move doors, and get tobacco clips… Secretary Zhou worked back and forth with the masses, carrying things. Seeing that Li Taishu, the Deputy Secretary of the Brigade Party Branch, didn't have rain gear, he immediately took off his raincoat and gave it to him, himself bustling about in the wind and rain with only a rain cape.

    Before long, all the bamboo mats, doors, tobacco clips, etc., from the members' homes were brought over. Some members even dismantled their own bed boards, and some even brought sleeping mats. However, there were still eight mu of seedlings without anything to cover them. Secretary Zhou, together with the masses, braved the wind and rain and went to Sihualing, which was several li away, to carry back a batch of rice straw. They wove the straw into mat after mat of straw curtains, built frames in the seedling fields, and covered the seedlings. By this time, the battle had lasted for two and a half hours, and the clock pointed to two o'clock in the morning. The masses saw that Secretary Zhou's clothes were completely wet and advised him:

    "Secretary Zhou, go back and rest."
    "You're all here, why should I go back and rest?"
    "We're in good health, it doesn't matter, your body probably can't take it!"
    "Can't take it?" Secretary Zhou patted his chest: "My body is no worse than yours! If you can stand it, I can stand it too!"

    The wind blew harder and the rain fell heavier, and the members' enthusiasm for protecting the seedlings grew even higher. They sang songs like "Ten Sings of the Commune's Goodness," "Eating Without Paying," and "Year of Bumper Harvest" while battling the wind and rain. The singing grew louder and louder. Newly woven straw curtains were placed on the seedlings, one after another. They fought until dawn. Secretary Zhou saw that all fifteen mu of seedlings were covered before rushing back to the commune office to call each brigade and inquire about the seedling protection situation.

　　风雨之夜
　　本报记者　欧阳贤
    夜深了，湖南资兴蓼市公社蓼市大队第一生产队的社员们正睡得香甜。
    窗外忽然刮起了呼呼的北风，瓦上响起了沙沙的雨点声，社员们被惊醒了。寒暑表很快就下降到摄氏十度左右。大家都了解情况的严重：十五亩多早稻秧田的谷种，播下去还只有四、五天，刚刚扶针发叶，怎么经得起这样的寒流侵袭！全队一百四十多个青壮年社员和部分老年社员，都很快地爬了起来，冒着风雨，对寒流展开了顽强的战斗。风雨交加，汽灯点不着，人们燃着松材火，把一担一担的火土灰，往秧苗上撒。可是，风这么大，人们斗篷都戴不稳，灰，怎能落地呢？火土灰被大风刮走了。社员们正焦急的时候，人群里传出了公社党委书记周继明的声音：“同志们！沉着点，这么大的风雨，撒火土灰是不行的，快搬板子、竹垫、烟夹这些东西来，搭架子把秧苗盖住！”他打着赤脚，脚管卷得高高的，雨水不断地从他的上身直往下流。晚十点钟，周书记刚从生产队开完会回到公社，就接到县委的紧急通知，说今晚有大风，温度会降到零度，还可能下冰雹。他一听到这个消息，忘却了一天的疲劳，要办公室的同志立即摇电话给各个大队，赶快发动全体社员，想尽一切办法护秧，自己拿了斗篷，披了雨衣，就往早稻秧最多的蓼市大队第一生产队跑。
    周书记的出现，给了社员以很大鼓舞。“周书记说的对！”社员们信心百倍地都回家里背竹垫，搬门板，拿烟夹……。周书记同群众一起，来回地搬运着。看到大队党总支副书记黎太书没有雨具，马上从身上脱下了雨衣送给他，自己就光带着斗篷在风雨中奔忙。
    不一会，社员家里的竹垫、门板、烟夹等全都搬来了。有的社员还拆来了自己的床板，有的还拿来了睡觉的席子。可是，还有八亩秧苗没有东西盖。周书记又同群众一起，顶着风雨，到里多路远的四花岭背来了一批稻草，用竹子编织成一床一床的草帘子，在秧田搭上架，覆盖在秧苗上。到这时，战斗已经持续了两个半钟头了，时针指向了下半夜两点。群众看到周书记的衣服全部湿了，都劝他：
    “周书记，快回去休息吧。”
    “你们都在这里，为什么我回去休息？”
    “我们的身体好，不要紧，你的身体恐怕受不了啊！”
    “受不了？”周书记拍拍自己的胸脯：“我的身体并不比你们差呀！你们顶得住，我也能顶得住！”
    风越刮的紧，雨越下的大，社员的护秧劲头也越高。他们一边唱着“十唱公社好”、“吃饭不要钱”、“丰收年”的歌子，一边与风雨搏斗，歌声越来越宏亮。新编织的草帘子一床接一床的往秧苗上盖。一直战斗到天亮，周书记看到十五亩秧苗全部盖好了，才赶回公社办公室去，打电话到各个大队，查问护秧的情况。
