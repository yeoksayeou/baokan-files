    Grasp Evaluation and Comparison
    Chu Xue
    Many successful leadership methods and working methods emerged during last year's Great Leap Forward, and evaluation and comparison was one of them. This year, we must continue to grasp evaluation and comparison, using it to promote production, accelerate production, and achieve a greater leap forward.
    The significance of evaluation and comparison lies in commending the advanced and encouraging the laggards to catch up, striving for universal improvement. At any time and in any work, there are three states: advanced, intermediate, and backward. Advanced technology and advanced experience are always initially created by a few advanced units and advanced producers. By applying advanced technology and advanced experience, they often create labor productivity that is much higher than the general level. However, the improvement of labor productivity of an enterprise, an industrial sector, or even the entire society does not depend on the production level of a few advanced individuals, but on whether the majority of employees have reached the advanced production level. How can we transform the advanced level of a few into the general production level of the majority of employees? An important method is to promote the laggards and those in the intermediate state to catch up with the advanced through evaluation and comparison.
    The existence of advanced, intermediate, and backward states is an objective law. However, advanced, intermediate, and backward are also relative. With the development of production, as the tide rises, so does the boat, the originally advanced may become backward if they stand still; as long as they work hard, "everyone can become a Yao or Shun," and the originally backward can also become advanced. This is also an objective law. These two laws are the objective basis of evaluation and comparison. The responsibility of leaders is to be good at discovering technologies and methods for achieving advanced labor productivity through evaluation and comparison, and to popularize these methods among the masses as soon as possible; at the same time, they should always pay attention to discovering more advanced technologies and methods, and further improve them on the basis of popularization. Such popularization—improvement—re-popularization—re-improvement, repeating endlessly, with each repetition advancing to a higher level, will continuously improve the labor productivity of the entire enterprise and the whole society. The Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, through the "Six Comparisons" competition, increased the labor productivity of the main workshops by more than 30% in March compared to February, which is an example.
    Specifically, the role of evaluation and comparison is mainly twofold: First, to boost morale. By establishing advanced banners through evaluation and comparison, we can use concrete facts to break superstitions and liberate our thinking; we can stimulate the enthusiasm of employees to strive for the upstream, and encourage the laggards to catch up quickly; we can urge the advanced to work harder and strive for greater achievements. The second role is to discover and accumulate advanced experience, and erect ladders for the majority of employees to "reach a higher level" in production technology and working methods. Leaders need to consciously give full play to the role of evaluation and comparison, especially to seize the opportunity to summarize and promote advanced experience. Discovering advanced individuals and advanced experience is only the beginning of the role of evaluation and comparison; summarizing the advanced experience of the advanced and promoting it is the only way to blossom and bear fruit, and achieve the ultimate goal of universally improving labor productivity through evaluation and comparison.
    To correctly exert the role of evaluation and comparison, we must put politics in command. Our evaluation and competition are not competition in the style of trophyism, but for common improvement, for accelerating socialist construction. From this point of view, the laggards should learn with humility, and the advanced should "teach tirelessly." Whether teaching or learning, the purpose is to develop production and strengthen the socialist forces. When employees understand these principles, they will actively catch up and enthusiastically help each other, working together to improve the labor productivity of the entire society. Experience in various places has proved that strengthening communist ideological education is the soul of evaluation and comparison work.
    The second quarter is the decisive quarter for the victorious completion of this year's leap forward plan for production and construction, and there is an urgent need to rapidly and universally improve labor productivity; the broad masses of employees have been further mobilized, and a new upsurge of competition has arrived, and there is an urgent need to effectively strengthen leadership—grasping evaluation and comparison is the right time!

    抓评比
    楚雪
    去年的大跃进中有许多成功的领导方法和工作方法，评比即是其一。今年仍然要抓评比，通过评比来推动生产，促进生产，实现更大的跃进。
    评比的意义在于表扬先进，鼓励落后者赶上先进，求得普遍的提高。在任何时候，任何工作中，都存在着先进、中间、落后三种状态。先进技术、先进经验，开始总是由少数先进单位、先进生产者创造出来。由于运用了先进技术和先进经验，他们往往会创造出比一般水平高得多的劳动生产率。但是，一个企业、一个产业部门以至整个社会的劳动生产率的提高，并不决定于少数先进者的生产水平，而决定于大多数职工是否都达到了先进的生产水平。怎样使少数人的先进水平变成广大职工普遍的生产水平呢？重要的办法，就是通过评比，促使落后和中间状态的赶上先进。
    先进、中间、落后三种状态的存在，这是客观规律。但是，先进、中间、落后又是相对的。随着生产的发展，“水涨船高”，原来先进的如果裹足不前，可能变得落后；只要刻苦努力，“人皆可以为尧舜”，原来落后的也可能成为先进。这也是客观规律。这两条规律，便是评比的客观基础。领导者的责任，就是要善于通过评比，发现达到先进的劳动生产率的技术和方法，尽快在广大群众中普及这种方法；同时，随时注意发现更先进的技术和方法，再在普及的基础上进一步提高。如此普及——提高——再普及——再提高，反复无穷，每一反复都进到高的一级，整个企业和全社会的劳动生产率就不断提高了。青岛四方机车厂通过“六比”竞赛，3月份全厂主要车间的劳动生产率比2月份提高30％以上，就是一个例子。
    具体说来，评比的作用主要有二：一是鼓舞干劲。通过评比，树立先进旗帜，可以用具体事实破除迷信，解放思想；可以激发职工群众争上游的热情，鼓舞落后者急起直追；可以促使先进者更加努力，争取更大的成就。作用之二是发现和积累先进经验，为广大职工在生产技术和工作方法方面“更上一层楼”竖起阶梯。领导人员需要有意识地充分发挥评比的作用，特别是要抓紧总结和推广先进经验。发现先进人物、先进经验，只是评比作用的开端；把先进者的先进经验总结起来，推广开去，才能开花结果，达到通过评比普遍提高劳动生产率的最终目的。
    要正确地发挥评比的作用，必须政治挂帅。我们的评比竞赛，不是锦标主义式的竞争，而是为了共同提高，为了加快社会主义建设。从这样的观点出发，落后者就要虚心学习，先进者就要“诲人不倦”。无论是教还是学，目的都是为了发展生产，壮大社会主义力量。职工们都懂得了这些道理，就会积极赶，热心帮，共同为提高全社会的劳动生产率而努力。各地的经验证明，加强共产主义的思想教育，是评比工作的灵魂。
    第二季度是胜利完成今年生产建设跃进计划的决定性季度，亟需迅速普遍提高劳动生产率；广大职工进一步发动起来了，新的竞赛高潮已经到来，亟需切实加强领导——抓紧评比，此其时矣！
