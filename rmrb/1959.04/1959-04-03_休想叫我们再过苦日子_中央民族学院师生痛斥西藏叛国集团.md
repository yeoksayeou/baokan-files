The news of the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group has aroused great anger among the more than three thousand teachers and students of all ethnic groups at the Central Institute for Nationalities. More than eight hundred Tibetan teachers and students were filled with righteous indignation and took the lead in denouncing the crime of the Tibetan reactionary group colluding with imperialism and betraying the motherland at various gatherings, and wholeheartedly supported the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion. They shouted in Tibetan in unison:
	“Thoroughly eliminate the rebel elements!”
	“Long live the unity of the motherland!”
They wrote letters to the People's Liberation Army that quelled the rebellion in Lhasa to express their respect, and wrote letters to their parents and brothers in Tibet, asking them to resolutely assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion.

Teachers and students of all ethnic groups in the entire institute, together with Tibetan teachers and students, denounced the towering crimes of the Tibetan reactionary group colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to launch a rebellion at various meetings and in the big-character posters they wrote; at the same time, they congratulated the Tibetan people on their new life. In this multi-ethnic family, Tibetan teachers and students felt the preciousness of the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups even more.

Many Tibetan teachers and students recalled their personal experiences. The Tibetan teacher Dorje Tsering was born into a poor herdsman family and worked as a servant since he was a child. He didn't even know the Tibetan alphabet when Tibet was peacefully liberated. Under the education and training of the Party, he is now a teacher in the Tibetan language teaching and research group of the Central Institute for Nationalities. Dorje Tsering said excitedly: "Thinking about the past and looking at the present, I know more clearly who is the benefactor of our Tibetan people and who is the enemy of our Tibetan people." He said that the treasonous crimes of a small handful of reactionaries in Tibet are absolutely intolerable.

All twenty-eight students in the geology major class are Tibetan children. They love the Party and Chairman Mao and yearn for a bright future. Tseden, a Tibetan girl from a poor family who grew up in Lhasa, worked odd jobs for people before liberation; after liberation, she participated in the construction of Tibet with the People's Liberation Army, and was rewarded several times for her good work; and now, she has become a student at the Central Institute for Nationalities from a girl who could not read. She said that only by following the Communist Party can the Tibetan people have a happy life. Zashi Wangqu, the son of a herdsman, couldn't stop talking about the changes in Lhasa after liberation. He said that once he went home, he didn't recognize many streets in Lhasa. Many new houses were built in the urban area, and hospitals and schools that didn't exist in the past were built. A park behind the Potala Palace, where robberies often occurred during the day in the past, and no one dared to go, has now been turned into a middle school. Zashi Wangqu also talked about his mother being cured of a serious illness by the Lhasa People's Hospital. His mother lived near Lhasa, and was dying of illness at that time. After the comrades of the CPC Tibet Working Committee learned about this situation, they immediately sent his mother to the People's Hospital for treatment for more than a month. Zashi Wangqu said that if it weren't for the Party, my mother would have died long ago.

The Tibetan student Caiwang recalled the scene of him and the People's Liberation Army soldiers jointly building the Kangzang Highway. It was a cold winter, and the soldiers' hands and feet were frostbitten, but in order to build a new Tibet, they always did the most arduous work, either chiseling rocks on cliffs or smashing stones. Many comrades were injured but refused to rest. Now that the reactionaries have openly betrayed the motherland, destroyed transportation, and harmed the people, and attacked the People's Liberation Army, Caiwang was extremely angry when he heard the news. He said at the forum: "The rebel group wants us to go back to the dark world and live a hard life again, that's a dream!"

    休想叫我们再过苦日子
    ——中央民族学院师生痛斥西藏叛国集团
    新华社记者　王孔诚　沈骊珠　任志樵
    西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动武装叛乱的消息传来，中央民族学院三千多名各族师生异常激愤。八百多个藏族师生更是义愤填膺，他们在各种集会上争先声讨西藏反动集团勾结帝国主义背叛祖国的罪行，衷心拥护国务院解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的命令。他们用藏语异口同声地高呼：
      “彻底肃清叛乱分子！”
      “祖国统一万岁！”
    他们纷纷写信给平息拉萨叛乱的人民解放军表示敬意，写信给西藏的父母兄弟，叫他们坚决协助人民解放军平息叛乱。
    全院各民族师生，同藏族师生一道，在各种会议上，在写的大字报上，痛斥西藏反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派发动叛乱的滔天罪行；同时向藏族师生们祝贺西藏人民的新生。在这个各民族大家庭里，藏族师生们更加感到祖国统一和民族团结的可贵。
    许多藏族师生回忆起了他们的切身经历。藏族教师多吉才仁出身于一个贫苦牧民家庭，从小就当佣人，和平解放西藏时，连藏文字母也不认识。在党的教育和培养下，现在他已经是中央民族学院藏语文教研组的教员了。多吉才仁激动地对人说：“想想过去，看看现在，我更加清楚地知道谁是我们藏族人民的恩人，谁是我们藏族人民的敌人。”他说，西藏一小撮反动分子的叛国罪行，是绝对不能容忍的。
    地质专业班的二十八名学员，全部是藏族子弟，他们爱戴党和毛主席，向往着未来美好的生活。生长在拉萨的贫民出身的藏族姑娘次登，解放前给人当零工；解放后，她和解放军一起参加西藏的建设，因为工作好，几次受到奖励；而现在，她又由一个不认识字的姑娘成了中央民族学院的学生。她说，只有跟着共产党走，西藏人民才有幸福的生活。牧民的儿子扎西旺曲一提起拉萨解放以后的变化，话就没个完。他说，我有一次回家，拉萨的许多街道都不认识了，市区盖了许多新房子，过去没有的医院、学校都盖起来了。布达拉宫后面的一个公园，过去白天都常发生抢劫，谁也不敢去，现在那里已经办起了一所中学。扎西旺曲还讲到自己母亲害了重病被拉萨人民医院治愈的事。他的母亲住在拉萨附近，那时病得奄奄一息，中共西藏工委的同志知道这情况后，立即送他母亲进人民医院，治疗了一个多月。扎西旺曲说，要不是党，我母亲早没命了。
    藏族学生才旺回忆起了自己和解放军战士共同修筑康藏公路的情景。那是一个寒冷的冬天，战士们的手脚都冻裂了，可是为了建设新西藏，他们一直干最艰苦的活，不是在悬崖上打石方，就是砸石子。不少同志负了伤都不肯休息。如今反动分子公开背叛祖国，破坏交通，残害人民，而且向解放军进攻，才旺听到这个消息气愤极了，他在座谈会上说：“叛乱集团想叫我们再回到黑暗世界过苦日子，那是梦想！”
