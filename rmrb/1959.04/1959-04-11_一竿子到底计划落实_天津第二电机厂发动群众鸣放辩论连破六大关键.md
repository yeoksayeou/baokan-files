Implementing the "One Pole to the End" Plan

Tianjin No. 2 Electric Motor Factory Mobilizes the Masses for Airing Views and Debate, Breaking Through Six Key Issues

(Our dispatch) The leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Handicraft Bureau's No. 2 Electric Motor Factory, boldly mobilized the masses, used the method of "one pole inserted to the end" and great airing of views and great debate, breaking through the key problems in completing the production plan, and implemented the second quarter production plan, doubling the output.

The second quarter task of this factory is more than double the actual completed number in the first quarter. When mobilizing the masses, the factory leadership adopted the method of "one pole inserted to the end," comprehensively handing over policies, tasks, and favorable and unfavorable conditions to all factory employees. In handing over tasks, they changed the past practice of "swallowing whole," only handing over the factory-wide task, and handed over the task directly to the team, and called on workers to launch a great airing of views targeting the leadership's ideology and work style, and the key issues in production and production management, and other aspects. At the beginning, some people had concerns, fearing that giving opinions to the leadership would damage relationships. In response to this idea, the leadership promptly clarified the relationship between airing views and improving leadership and work, mobilizing everyone to dispel concerns, boldly air views, and actively put forward rational proposals, fiercely removing the stumbling blocks in production. As a result, workers put forward more than 100 suggestions and opinions in two or three days, most of which were key issues in production and innovation proposals, and some opinions related to the factory leadership's work style and enterprise management system. Through airing views, everyone's enthusiasm was even greater, and the workers stated one after another: The motors we produce are national planned products, are used to equip the six major types of equipment, and failing to complete the plan will directly affect national construction. We must respond to the call of the Central Committee and the provincial and municipal party committees, make a great leap in the second quarter, and ensure the completion of the production task.

The factory leadership promptly analyzed the opinions aired by the masses, summarized them into eight key issues to ensure the completion of the second quarter plan, and then handed the eight key issues to the workers for discussion, organizing workers to engage in large-scale technological innovation. In two or three days, the workers had already broken through six key issues. For example, the rotor journal, which used to be operated manually, had high labor intensity and low production efficiency, failing to meet the planned requirements. Veteran worker Liu Genshen came up with the idea of using an electric hammer instead of manual operation, which increased production efficiency by thirteen times. According to the plan requirements, the foundry workshop needed to cast eight motor housing castings a day, but the actual output was not achieved. After tapping the potential of the cupola and adjusting the labor organization, the current daily output has reached ten.

While mobilizing employees to break through the key issues in production, the factory leadership also improved leadership and management work based on the opinions aired by the masses, strengthened leadership over daily production, inspected the plan and production progress on a daily basis, organized employees to conduct evaluations, and established some material requisition and quota management systems. Now, in order to ensure that every opinion aired by the masses is implemented, the factory leadership has established a rectification team.

The factory originally felt that there were many difficulties in completing the second quarter production plan. After mobilizing the masses, not only did the production task increase by more than two times compared with the actual completion number in the first quarter, but also labor productivity will increase by 25％, and costs will be reduced by 10％. The factory leadership has already arranged this plan into the daily work plan, and there are measures to ensure that as long as the daily production progress is grasped, the completion of the second quarter plan will be guaranteed. Since April, this factory has completed the plan on a daily basis.

　　一竿子到底计划落实
    天津第二电机厂发动群众鸣放辩论连破六大关键
    本报讯　天津市手工业局第二电机厂领导方面，放手发动群众，用一竿子插到底和大鸣大放大辩论的方法，突破了完成生产计划中的关键问题，使第二季度生产计划落实，产量翻两番。
    这个厂第二季度的任务要比第一季度实际完成的数字提高两倍多。在发动群众时，厂领导方面采取了一竿子插到底的办法，向全厂职工全面交政策、交任务，交有利条件和不利条件。并在交任务中，改变了过去“囫囵吞枣”，只交全厂任务的作法，把任务一直交到小组，并且号召工人针对领导上的思想作风和生产关键、生产管理等各方面存在的问题，展开大鸣大放。开始，有的人有顾虑，怕给领导提意见以后搞坏关系。针对这种思想，领导方面又及时给大家讲清鸣放和改进领导、改进工作的关系，动员大家解除顾虑，大胆鸣放，踊跃提出合理建议，狠狠地掀掉生产上的绊脚石。结果，工人们在两三天内提出了一百多件建议和意见，其中，绝大部分都是生产上的关键问题和革新建议，也有一部分意见涉及工厂领导作风和企业管理制度等。通过鸣放，大家的劲头更足了，工人们纷纷提出：我们生产的电动机是国家计划产品，是为六大设备配套的，完不成计划会直接影响国家建设，我们要响应中央和省、市委的号召，在第二季度内大跳一番，保证完成生产任务。
    工厂领导方面并及时分析了群众鸣放的意见，归纳成保证完成第二季度计划的八大关键，又把八大关键交给职工去讨论，组织职工大搞技术革新。在二、三天内，工人们已经突破了六大关键。例如转子掼轴，过去用人工操作，劳动强度大，生产效率不高，达不到计划要求，老工人刘根深想出了改用电锤代替手工操作，生产效率提高了十三倍。按照计划要求，翻砂工段一天需要铸出八个电动机外壳铸件，但实际达不到，经挖掘了化铁炉潜力，调整了劳动组织后，现在的日产量已经达到了十个。
    在发动职工突破生产关键的同时，这个厂领导方面还根据群众鸣放意见，改进领导和管理工作，加强对日常生产的领导，按日检查计划和生产进度，组织职工进行评比，还建立一些领料和定额管理制度，现在，工厂领导方面为了使群众鸣放意见件件有着落，成立了整改小组。
    这个厂完成第二季度生产计划，原来感到困难很多，经过发动群众以后，不但生产任务比第一季度实际完成数增加了二倍多，而且劳动生产率将提高25％，成本降低10％。这个厂的领导方面已经把这个计划安排到日作业计划中，而且有措施保证，只要抓住每天的生产进度，第二季度计划完成就有了保证。4月份以来，这个厂按日完成了计划。
