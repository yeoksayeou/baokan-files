　　The United States is Plotting New Aggression Conspiracies in Central America
　　The Target is the Cuban Revolutionary Regime and Central American National Independence Movements
    Xinhua News Agency, 15th—The United States Ambassadors to twelve countries in the Caribbean region held a three-day top-secret meeting in San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, last weekend, and meticulously planned measures to suppress the national liberation movements in Central American countries and undermine the Cuban revolutionary regime. The meeting shows that, with the growing national independence movements in Latin American countries, the United States is plotting new intervention and subversion conspiracies in the Caribbean region.
    It can be seen from the meeting communiqué and the limited disclosures by the Western press that the participants in the meeting were very "concerned" about the tide of Central American people opposing pro-American dictatorial regimes and the Cuban government's policy of safeguarding national independence. The meeting decided to continue to intensify the provision of American weapons and money to the pro-American regimes in Dominica, Nicaragua, and Haiti, in order to suppress the resistance of the people of these countries and use them as tools for the United States to subvert and interfere in Cuba. The communiqué proposed to use the "Organization of American States" controlled by Washington to interfere in the revolutionary struggles of the people in the Caribbean region.
    On the same day that the meeting in San Salvador closed (April 11), Allen Dulles, the chief director of subversive activities for the United States and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, reported "secret intelligence" to Eisenhower. One of the topics discussed by the two was the situation in the Caribbean region.
    For some time, the United States has adopted various means, including military, political, and propaganda, to launch an offensive against the Cuban people and the revolutionary government, as well as the people of Central American countries. On the one hand, the United States government has stepped up aid to the pro-American regimes in Haiti and Dominica, which are hostile to Cuba, continuously sending American weapons to the governments of these two countries, dispatching warships carrying 9,000 Marines one after another to the coast of Dominica, and the United States fleet has held a series of intimidating military "exercises" in the Caribbean Sea; on the other hand, it has supplied a large number of weapons to the remnants of the Batista elements who fled to the United States, allowing them to use the Florida peninsula, which extends to Cuba, as a base for organizing subversive activities.
    At the same time, the United States authorities instigated the governments of Dominica and Haiti to desperately create a tense situation, clamoring about the "threat" and the danger of "invasion" from Cuba, demanding that the United States "take measures." The dictatorial government of Dominica has even mobilized its troops, with swords drawn and bows bent. American military and political figures and the American propaganda machine have also issued a barrage of noises against Cuba, stigmatizing Cuba as preparing for "aggression" and attacking Cuba as having a "red" danger.
    Under the conspiracy deployment of the United States, as Cuban Prime Minister Castro pointed out, Cuba is facing the danger of counter-revolutionary attacks from Florida in the north and Dominica in the east. The United States’ counter-biting propaganda offensive is precisely to divert the attention of the people of Central American countries in order to conceal its intervention conspiracy and create conditions so that it can use Dominica, Haiti, and other countries as bases for the United States to launch armed intervention. All of this makes people see the scene before the legitimate government of Guatemala was subverted in 1954. It was the same dictatorial regime of Dominica that, in that famous international crime, assisted in completing Washington's plan to subvert the then Guatemalan government with weapons and money.
    The United States’ major conspiracy in the Caribbean Sea is a new signal for stepping up interference and suppressing the national independence movements throughout Latin America. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Taylor recently made a statement openly threatening that the desire of the people of Latin American countries for independence, democracy, freedom, and improved living conditions is a "threat" to the "security" of the United States. All this clearly shows that the United States is preparing to launch military intervention and suppression against the Latin American people who are striving for independence. As another aspect of the United States' policy of stepping up interference in Latin America, the United States diplomatic authorities are instigating some Latin American countries behind the scenes to oppose the Soviet Union, attempting to create tension between Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico, and the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department clearly believes that preventing the elimination of the Cold War and preventing Latin American countries from maintaining and restoring good relations with the Soviet Union are indispensable parts of the aforementioned U.S. policy being smoothly implemented in Latin America.
    Now, ominous clouds are shrouding the Caribbean Sea, and the tentacles of American aggression and interference are further extending into the South American continent. The people of Central and South America and the people of the world are vigilantly watching the movements of the new American conspiracy.

### 加勒比海上空笼罩着不祥的乌云  美国在中美地区策划新侵略阴谋  矛头指向古巴革命政权和中美的民族独立运动

　　加勒比海上空笼罩着不祥的乌云
　　美国在中美地区策划新侵略阴谋
　　矛头指向古巴革命政权和中美的民族独立运动
    新华社15日讯　美国驻加勒比海地区十二个国家大使上周末在萨尔瓦多首都举行了三天的绝密会议，详尽地策划了镇压中美国家民族解放运动和破坏古巴革命政权的措施。这次会议表明，在拉丁美洲各国民族独立运动日益壮大的情况下，美国正在加勒比海地区策划新的干涉和颠复阴谋。
    从会议公报和西方报界有限的透露中可以看出，会议参加者对中美各国人民反对亲美独裁政权的浪潮和古巴政府维护民族独立的政策非常“忧虑”，会议决定继续加紧以美国武器和金钱给予多米尼加、尼加拉瓜和海地的亲美政权，以便镇压这些国家人民的反抗并利用它们充当美国颠复和干涉古巴的工具。公报中提出要利用华盛顿控制下的“美洲国家组织”来干涉加勒比海地区人民的革命斗争。
    就在圣萨尔瓦多城会议闭幕的同一天（11日），美国搞颠复活动的总指挥、中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯向艾森豪威尔汇报了“秘密情报”，两人讨论的内容之一就是加勒比海地区的局势。
    一个时期以来，美国已经采取了军事、政治和宣传各种手段，针对着古巴人民和革命政府以及中美各国人民展开攻势。美国政府一面加紧援助敌视古巴的紧邻海地和多米尼加亲美政权，把美国武器源源不断送交这两国政府，派遣军舰装载九千名海军陆战队接二连三开到多米尼加海岸，美国舰队在加勒比海举行了一系列恫吓性的军事“演习”；一面又供应大批武器给逃亡到美国的残余的巴蒂斯塔分子，容许他们利用伸向古巴的佛罗里达半岛充当组织颠复活动的根据地。
    同时，美国当局唆使多米尼加和海地政府拼命制造紧张局势，叫嚷什么古巴的“威胁”和“入侵”的危险，要求美国“采取措施”。多米尼加独裁政府更调集军队，剑拔弩张。美国军政要人和美国宣传机器也发出了反对古巴的一片吵嚷声，污蔑古巴准备“侵略”，攻击古巴有“赤化”危险。
    在美国的阴谋部署下，正像古巴总理卡斯特罗所指出的，古巴面临着从北面的佛罗里达和东面的多米尼加发动反革命进攻的危险。而美国反咬一口的宣传攻势，正是为了转移中美各国人民的视线，以掩饰它的干涉阴谋，并创造条件，以便利用多米尼加、海地等国充当美国发动武装干涉的基地。所有这些，使人们又看到了1954年危地马拉合法政府被颠复前夕的情景。就是同一个多米尼加独裁政权，在那次著名的国际罪行中，以武器和金钱协助完成了华盛顿颠复当时的危地马拉政府的计划。
    美国在加勒比海的重大阴谋是加紧干涉和镇压整个拉丁美洲民族独立运动的新的信号。美国陆军参谋长泰勒最近发表谈话，公然威胁说，拉丁美洲各国人民要求独立、民主、自由和改善生活条件的愿望是对美国“安全”的“威胁”。这一切清清楚楚地说明了，美国正在准备对争取独立的拉丁美洲人民发动军事干涉和镇压。作为美国加紧干涉拉丁美洲政策的另一面，美国外交当局正在幕后煽动一些拉丁美洲国家反对苏联，企图在乌拉圭、阿根廷、墨西哥和苏联之间造成紧张关系。美国国务院显然认为：阻止消除冷战，阻止拉丁美洲国家同苏联保持和恢复良好关系，是在拉丁美洲顺利推行上述美国政策的不可缺少的部分。
    现在，加勒比海上空笼罩着不祥的乌云，美国侵略干涉的触角也正在进一步伸入南美大陆。中美、南美各国人民和全世界人民正在警惕地注视着美国新阴谋的动向。
