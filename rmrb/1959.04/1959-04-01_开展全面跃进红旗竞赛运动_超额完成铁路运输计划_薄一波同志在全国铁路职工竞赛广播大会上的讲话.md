Comrades, national railway workers fighting on the transportation front!
Comrades, all commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps!
Comrades, workers of transportation machinery manufacturing factories!

Today, the National Railway Workers' Comprehensive Leap Forward Red Flag Emulation Radio Conference, hosted by the Ministry of Railways, aims to mobilize all forces and positive factors on the railway front to smoothly complete the state's transportation and railway construction tasks for this year, especially the second quarter. This is a very important conference. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend my cordial greetings and congratulations to you.

In the past year, China has ushered in a new situation of a national, comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction. The national industry has greatly developed, agriculture has had a bumper harvest, rural areas have realized the people's commune system, and the people's communist consciousness has greatly improved. All of this proves that our Party's general line for socialist construction is completely correct and has great vitality. Under the principle of taking steel as the key link and making a comprehensive leap forward, railway workers fought heroically last year and completed the state's transportation tasks despite insufficient transportation equipment capacity, fighting a very beautiful battle in the struggle to achieve 10.7 million tons of steel.

This year is a decisive year for China's three years of hard work. The national economy will have a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than last year. The Party and Chairman Mao have called on the nation to produce 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 105 billion catties of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton this year. This is a great task for the entire Party and the people of the country. Railway transportation plays an extremely important role in realizing the annual plan centered on the "four major targets." This year, the volume of railway freight will increase by 50% to 60% compared to last year, and the tasks of manufacturing locomotives and vehicles, and building new lines and double tracks will increase by one or even several times compared to last year. Let us fight an even more beautiful battle on the transportation front to respond to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao!

Currently, the people of the whole country are fighting intensely to complete and overfulfill this year's national plan, and a vigorous new and greater production upsurge has already emerged across the country. Railway workers fighting on the transportation front have done a good job in completing the railway transportation plan for the first quarter of this year: transportation indicators have been rising month by month. In February and March, the average daily number of wagons loaded was more than 4,000 more than in January, the turnaround time of freight cars was shortened from 2.66 days to 2.45 days, and the safety and punctuality situation has also greatly improved. Here, it is particularly worth pointing out the gradual increase in the number of wagons loaded on a ten-day basis with very few fluctuations. However, we must not be complacent in any way because of this. The transportation tasks for the next three quarters will become heavier and heavier with the arrival of a greater upsurge in the entire industrial and agricultural production. We must redouble our efforts to complete them. In order to complete the greater transportation tasks in the future, I would like to offer the following three suggestions to all railway workers fighting on the transportation front as the direction of our joint efforts.

First, resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and strengthen cooperation between railways and factories and mines.

The main task of railway work is to transport more and faster, and to maximize the satisfaction of the transportation needs of all aspects of the national economic leap forward. The sharp increase in transport volume and the insufficient capacity of transport equipment are the main contradictions in the current transport work. This requires that in terms of freight transport, we must follow the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and prioritize according to "heavy, important, and urgent" to ensure key tasks and take care of general tasks. Our policy is to take steel as the key link and make a comprehensive leap forward. If steel can leap forward, the entire industry can be driven forward. Steelmaking requires a large amount of iron and coal. In railway transport volume, the volume of coal and steel and related materials needed for the production of coal and steel accounts for nearly 60%, and the volume of coal alone accounts for nearly 40% of the total transport volume. Therefore, the primary task of railway transportation is to ensure the transportation of coal and steel. The transportation tasks of major materials such as petroleum, timber, and grain must also be guaranteed. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure the transportation of a certain amount of raw materials for light industry and daily necessities. The "marshal leads logistics" and "piggyback" methods created by railway workers are very good and should be vigorously promoted. Let me repeat, no matter what season, the transportation tasks of coal and steel must be completed 100%. We must ensure that the coal and steel departments always owe you accounts, and you must not owe them accounts.

Economical, rational, and effective use of transportation capacity is a major issue that railway work should always be concerned about. Rational transportation requires solving two problems. One is the problem of the rational layout of industry. This year, the central government has made some adjustments to the layout of the coal and iron industry and is continuing to adjust it. The long-distance north-to-south coal transport and long-distance empty vehicle return will be reduced. However, the rational layout of industry will take a relatively long time to solve. The railway department has the responsibility to promote the increasing rationalization of the layout of factories and mines. The other problem is the rational allocation of materials. The allocation of materials should consider rational flow directions, and try to avoid counter-currents, avoid excessive distances and duplicate transportation. Therefore, each consignor unit, when formulating material allocation plans, must carefully consider rational transportation. The railway department must carefully review the freight plans of various departments and not waste a single vehicle or a single ton-kilometer of transportation power. The metallurgical department, coal department, grain department, forestry industry department, commercial department, and other consignor departments should all help the railway department to achieve rational transportation of materials.

This year, the construction of new railways must also first ensure the needs of coal and steel transportation, and focus on the construction of railway branch lines, dedicated lines for coal and steel, and the reconstruction of existing railways, especially the construction of double tracks. Whether the task of manufacturing locomotives and vehicles can be completed is also extremely important for the completion of this year's transportation tasks. The central government has listed the production of locomotives and vehicles as one of the "six guaranteed households" and must guarantee the completion of the task of manufacturing locomotives and vehicles. The dedicated materials allocated for manufacturing locomotives and vehicles and building railways must be used for dedicated purposes, and the materials must be used in the most urgently needed places.

Strengthening cooperation between the railway department and the relevant factories and mines, especially coal mines and steel plants, is an important condition for ensuring a common leap forward. Since the Great Leap Forward, cooperation between the railway department and some factories and mines has made great progress. We must go further and further and further shorten the time vehicles stay in factories and mines, organize direct trains, and strive for full loads for every vehicle.

Second, walk on two legs.

Walking on two legs is the specific application of China's general line for building socialism. Railway work must also walk on two legs. In railway work, improving the utilization efficiency of existing equipment and increasing transportation capacity must be carried out simultaneously. Excavating the potential capacity of existing equipment should not be relaxed at any time, especially at present, it has more practical significance. The utilization rate of railway equipment has been greatly improved in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, but it cannot be said that the potential has been fully tapped. We must further strengthen transportation organization work to complete more transportation tasks with limited equipment. We must give full play to the greatest subjective initiative on the basis of existing equipment and existing material technology. We must strive to achieve everything that can be achieved through effort. We ask everyone to take down this year's transportation tasks with the spirit of "jumping a bit."

On the other hand, a considerable part of this year's increase in transport volume will be borne by newly built lines and equipment. Therefore, we must also seriously and vigorously grasp railway infrastructure construction. In infrastructure construction, the construction of lines and the manufacturing of vehicles must be carried out simultaneously. In terms of railway construction, we must also walk on two legs, and carry out "large, foreign, and mass" and "small, local, and mass" simultaneously. "Large and foreign" railways are the backbone. "Small and local" railways are auxiliary. "Small and local railways" require less investment, are easier to build, materials are easier to solve, and technology is easier for the masses to master. It is beneficial to build small and local railways under certain conditions.

Third, we must carry out mass movements on a large scale. Taking the mass line and carrying out mass movements on a large scale were done relatively well on the railway during last year's Great Leap Forward. This year, we must continue to carry out mass movements on a large scale. To make a great leap forward, we must carry out mass movements on a large scale. After last year's Great Leap Forward, everyone has a deeper understanding of this point. This year, in addition to continuing to submit the plan to the masses for discussion, the railway department also summarized last year's experience and will launch a "Comprehensive Leap Forward Red Flag Emulation Campaign" and a "Vehicle, Material, and Technology Contribution Campaign" across the country. In the transportation department, launch a "One-Five-One, Million Tons, Safety and Punctuality Campaign." In the design and construction department, launch a "Long (Tunnel), Large (Bridge), Heavy (Key Earthwork) Rapid Construction Campaign." In the factory department, launch a "Three Contributions, Five Comparisons (Compare High Yield, Compare High Quality, Compare Technology, Compare Collaboration, Compare Savings) Campaign." These slogans are relatively comprehensive and have key points. We should deeply mobilize and let all railway workers understand the content of the movement and strive for its realization.

The mass movement should focus on technological revolution and accelerating the increase of labor productivity. To make a great leap forward, we cannot rely on increasing manpower or working overtime. We must work hard and cleverly. Everyone must use their brains to think of ways, everyone must contribute ideas, do everything possible to improve labor productivity. Last year, railway workers made many creations and innovations, such as "local humps," "high platforms and low cargo positions," "moving idle lines," and "simple turnouts." The result of the promotion greatly improved production efficiency. These are new creations according to China's specific conditions. Grasp these new things, promote them to the whole country, and they will have a great effect. This year, the railway department's workers must make persistent efforts and show their skills in the technological revolution. You are all preparing to carry out the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, road maintenance, and construction in the second quarter. This is a very good topic. I hope to make achievements in this area.

The safety and punctuality campaign that has already been launched must also be resolutely implemented to the end.

Comrades, all employees! This year's railway transportation and construction tasks are very arduous, and there are many difficulties. However, we believe that with the correct leadership of the Party, the support of the people of the whole country, the enthusiasm and dedication of more than one million railway workers, coupled with the considerable experience you have accumulated, you will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and complete and overfulfill the arduous and glorious tasks assigned to you by the Party and the state. Greet the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with outstanding achievements, and greet the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Industry, Transportation, Infrastructure Construction, Finance, and Trade to be held in the fourth quarter of this year.

    开展全面跃进红旗竞赛运动　超额完成铁路运输计划
    薄一波同志在全国铁路职工竞赛广播大会上的讲话
    战斗在交通运输战线上的全国铁路职工同志们！
    全体铁道兵指战员同志们！
    运输机械制造工厂的职工同志们！
    今天，在铁道部主持下举行的全国铁路职工全面跃进的红旗竞赛广播大会，其目的是动员铁路战线上的一切力量，一切积极因素，来顺利地完成今年特别是第二季度的国家运输和铁路建设任务，这是一个很重要的大会。我代表党中央和国务院向你们致以亲切的慰问和祝贺。
    过去的一年，在我国已经打开了建设社会主义的全民的全面大跃进的新局面，全国工业大发展，农业大丰收，农村实现了人民公社化，人民的共产主义觉悟大大提高，这一切都证明了我们党的社会主义建设总路线，是完全正确的，是具有伟大的生命力的。在以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针之下，去年铁路职工们英勇奋战，在运输设备能力不足的条件下，完成了国家所给予的运输任务，在为实现一千零七十万吨钢的战斗中，打了一个很漂亮的仗。
    今年是我国苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，国民经济比去年还要有更大更好更全面的跃进。党和毛主席号召：今年全国要生产一千八百万吨钢，三点八亿吨煤，一万零五百亿斤粮食，一亿担棉花，这是全党和全国人民的伟大任务。铁路运输，对于实现以“四大指标”为中心的全年计划，有极为重要的作用。今年铁路货运量将比去年增长50％到60％，制造机车、车辆，修建新线、复线的任务都将比去年增加一倍甚至几倍。让我们在运输战线上打一个更漂亮的仗来回答党和毛主席的号召吧！
    现在，全国人民为了完成和超额完成今年的国家计划，正在紧张地战斗着，一个轰轰烈烈的新的更大的生产高潮，已经在全国出现。在运输战线上奋战的铁路职工同志们对于今年第一季度铁路运输计划完成得很好：运输指标月月上升，2、3月份，每日平均装车数比1月份多四千多车，货车周转时间从二点六六天缩短到二点四五天，安全正点的情况也有很大的进步。在这里，特别值得指出的是装车数的逐旬增长而很少忽起忽落的现象。但是，绝不能因此而有任何骄傲，今后三个季度的运输任务，随着整个工农业生产更大高潮的到来，将越来越重，必须加倍努力，才能完成。为了完成今后更大的运输任务，我在这里向奋战在交通运输战线上的全体铁路职工同志们提出以下三点意见，作为我们共同努力的方向。
    第一，坚决贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的方针，加强铁路和厂矿企业之间的协作。
    铁路工作的主要任务是，运得多、运得快，最大限度地满足国民经济大跃进中各方面的运输需要。运量激增，而运输设备能力不足，这是当前运输工作的主要矛盾，这就要求在货运方面必须根据“全国一盘棋”的方针，按“重重急急”排队，重其所重，急其所急，保证重点、照顾一般。我们的政策是以钢为纲，全面跃进，钢能够跃上去，整个工业就能够带动起来。炼钢要用大量的铁和煤，在铁路运量中，煤炭和钢铁以及生产煤炭和钢铁所需要的有关物资的运量约占将近60％，而煤炭的运量就要占整个运量的将近40％。因此，铁路运输的首要任务就是保证煤炭和钢铁的运输。石油、木材、粮食等主要物资的运输任务也要加以保证。同时，还要保证一定数量的轻工业原料和生活必需品的运输。铁路职工所创造的“元帅带后勤”和“捎脚”的办法很好，应当大力推广。我再重复一句，不管哪个季节都要把煤炭钢铁的运输任务百分之百地完成，要做到让煤炭和钢铁部门总是欠你们的账，而你们不要欠他们的账。
    经济地、合理地、有效地使用运输力，是铁路工作应当经常关心的一个主要问题。合理运输要求解决两个问题。一个是工业的合理布局问题。今年中央对于煤铁工业布局已经作了一些调整，并且正在继续调整。长距离的北煤南运和长途的车辆回空将会有所减少。但是工业的合理布局需要比较长的时间才能解决，铁路部门有责任促使工矿企业的布局日益合理化。另一个问题是物资的合理调拨问题。物资的调拨，应该考虑合理的流向，尽量避免对流，避免过远和重复运输。因此，各个托运单位，在制订物资调拨计划的时候，要认真地考虑合理运输，铁路部门要认真审查各部门的货运计划，不要浪费一辆车、一个吨公里的运输力量。冶金部门、煤炭部门、粮食部门、森林工业部门、商业部门以及其他托运部门都应当帮助铁道部门做到物资的合理运输。
    今年新建铁路，也要首先保证煤炭和钢铁运输的需要，把修建铁路支线，修建煤炭和钢铁专用线，改造现有铁路特别是复线的修建，作为重点。制造机车、车辆的任务能否完成，对今年运输任务的完成也有极其重大的关系，中央已把生产机车、车辆列为“六保户”之一，一定要保证完成机车车辆的制造任务。分配给制造机车车辆和修建铁路的专用材料，必须专材专用，要把材料用到最急需的地方去。
    加强铁路部门和各有关厂矿企业特别是煤矿和钢铁厂的协作，是保证共同跃进的重要条件。大跃进以来，铁路部门和某些厂矿企业的协作已经有了很大的进步。百尺竿头，更进一步，必须再加缩短车辆在厂矿的停留时间，组织直达列车，争取车车满载。
    第二，用两条腿走路。
    用两条腿走路，是我国建设社会主义总路线的具体运用。铁路工作也必须用两条腿走路。在铁路工作中，提高现有设备的利用效率和增加运输能力必须同时并举。挖掘现有设备的潜在能力，在任何时候都不应当放松，特别在目前具有更加现实的意义。铁路设备的利用率，几年来，特别是在大跃进以来，虽然有了很大的提高，但是还不能说潜力已经挖尽，要进一步加强运输组织工作，以有限的设备完成更多的运输任务。要在现有设备现有物质技术的基础上，发挥最大的主观能动性。凡是经过努力能够做到的事情都要争取做到。要求大家用“跳一跳”的精神把今年的运输任务拿下来。
    另一方面，今年增长的运量有不少的部分要靠新增建的线路和设备来担负，所以对于铁路的基本建设，也要认真地狠狠地抓。在基本建设中，修建线路和制造车辆要同时并举。在修建铁路方面，也要两条腿走路，“大、洋、群”和“小、土、群”同时并举。“大、洋”铁路是骨干。“小、土”铁路是辅助，“小土铁路”投资少，建设容易，材料也比较好解决，技术也容易为群众掌握。在一定的条件下建设小土铁路是有好处的。
    第三，要大搞群众运动。走群众路线，大搞群众运动，在去年大跃进中，铁路上是做得较好的，今年还要大搞群众运动。要大跃进就要大搞群众运动。去年大跃进以后，对这一点大家都有比较深刻的体会，今年铁道部门除了继续把计划交给群众讨论以外，还总结了去年的经验，要在全国开展“全面跃进红旗竞赛运动”，“献车、献料、献技术运动”，在运输部门开展“一——五——一、百万吨、安全正点运动”，在设计施工部门开展“长（隧）、大（桥）、重（重点土石方）快速施工运动”，在工厂部门开展“三献、五比（比高产、比优质、比技术、比协作、比节约）运动”，这些口号比较全面，又有重点，应该深入动员，使铁路战线上所有的职工同志们都了解运动的内容，并且为它的实现而奋斗。
    群众运动应当以技术革命、加速提高劳动生产率为中心内容。我们要大跃进，一不能靠增加人，二不能靠加班加点，要苦干，也要巧干，人人动脑筋想办法，人人献计，千方百计，提高劳动生产率。去年铁路职工的创造和革新很多，像“土驼峰”、“高站台、低货位”、“闲置线路搬家”、“简易道岔”等等，推广的结果，都大大地提高了生产效率。这是按照中国的具体情况的新的创造，抓住这些新东西，推广到全国去，就能发生很大的效果。今年铁道部门的职工更要再接再厉，在技术革命中大显身手。你们大家在第二季度准备大搞装卸、养路、施工的机械化和半机械化，这是一个很好的题目。希望在这方面做出成绩来。
    已经开展起来的安全、正点运动也必须坚决贯彻到底。
    全体职工同志们！今年铁路的运输和建设任务很艰巨，也有不少困难，但是，我们相信有党的正确的领导，有全国人民的支持，有百万以上铁路职工的干劲、钻劲，加上你们已经积累了不少经验，你们一定能够克服一切困难，完成和超额完成党和国家交给你们的艰巨而又光荣的任务。以出色的成绩来迎接伟大的建国十周年，迎接在今年第四季度召开的全国工业、交通运输、基建、财贸先进集体和先进生产者代表会议。
