    Mastering the Laws and Eliminating in Batches
    The Wuzhong People's Commune Skillfully Fights Pests and Diseases
    (By our correspondent) The first battle in the Wuzhong People's Commune in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in their skillful fight against pests and diseases has been won completely. Walking into this commune, one can see: the tree bark parasitized by pests and diseases has been completely scraped off, the tree holes harboring pests have been dug out and cleaned, the fallen leaves, fruits, and weeds on the ground have been burned as fertilizer, and the pear, apple, and sand pear trees, having had their parasite cocoons removed, are stretching their branches and leaves with ease.
    The main experience of the Wuzhong Commune in preventing and controlling pests and diseases is based on the activity patterns of various pests and diseases, finding a set of effective methods to skillfully fight them. Under the direct leadership of the Commune Party Committee, agricultural technicians and experienced farmers worked together to summarize the activity patterns of more than eighty types of pests and diseases that had occurred in the commune in the past (including twenty-four types of diseases and fifty-six types of insect pests): first, they categorized and ranked the types and severity of pests and diseases affecting crops, thereby determining the main targets; second, based on the growth sequence of crops and the occurrence sequence of pests and diseases, they formulated methods and steps for preventing and controlling pests and diseases in grains, cash crops, vegetables, and orchards. For example, wheat pests and diseases include more than ten types, such as wheat midges, wireworms, wheat aphids, and rust, among which the wheat midge is the most harmful in the local area. Therefore, it was determined that wheat should focus on eliminating wheat midges, combined with eliminating other pests and diseases; at the same time, based on the growth characteristics of these pests and diseases, they were divided into three types: underground pests, overwintering pests, and pests and diseases during the wheat development period. This led to the decision to carry out three battles against wheat pests and diseases: the first battle before spring sowing, mainly using soil disinfection, seed disinfection, and treatment of new grass and straw that may harbor parasite cocoons to eliminate underground and overwintering pests; the second battle was after the wheat began to head, using methods such as catching and spraying pesticide powder to eliminate pests and diseases before they occurred; the final battle was before storage, to completely disinfect the seeds to thoroughly eliminate pests and diseases.
    After summarizing these experiences, they were handed over to the masses for discussion and revision. This not only further enriched and developed these experiences but also deepened the masses' understanding of the importance of preventing and controlling pests and diseases, thereby launching an enthusiastic mass movement to skillfully fight pests and diseases throughout the commune. Under the slogan of "No sowing without soil treatment, no sowing without seed disinfection," all the wheat seeds for more than 20,000 mu of land and the hemp seeds for more than 10,000 mu of land in the commune were treated with warm water soaking and Ceresan dressing, three jin of 666 powder was applied per mu, and all weeds and straw in the fields were treated, eliminating pests and diseases before they occurred.
    Currently, the commune is stepping up the training of professional team leaders and technicians, planning to organize a prevention and control network with more than 1,200 people, indicating that the second battle will soon be launched victoriously.

### 掌握规律分批歼灭  吴忠人民公社巧战病虫害

    掌握规律分批歼灭
    吴忠人民公社巧战病虫害
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区吴忠人民公社社员巧战病虫害的第一个战役已获全胜。走进这个公社会看到：寄生病虫害的树皮已全被刮掉，深藏害虫的树窟窿也被挖净刷光，地上的落叶、落果、杂草已被烧做肥料，被摘掉了寄生虫茧的梨、苹果和沙果树正轻松地伸展着枝叶。
    吴忠公社防治病虫害的主要经验，是根据各种病虫害的活动规律，找到了一套巧战病虫害的有效办法。在公社党委的直接领导下，发动农业技术人员与老农一起总结了全社过去发生过的八十多种病虫害的活动规律（其中病害二十四种，虫害五十六种）：首先根据为害作物病虫害的种类和程度加以分类排队，从而确定主要的打击对象；其次依据农作物的生长次序和病虫害的发生次序，制定出粮食、经济作物、蔬菜和园林的防治病虫害的方法和步骤。如小麦的病虫害，就有吸浆虫、金针虫、麦蚜、锈病等十多种，其中在当地危害最大的是吸浆虫，因此确定小麦以消灭吸浆虫为主，结合消灭其它病虫害；同时根据这些病虫害的生长特点，又分出地下害虫、越冬害虫和小麦发育期病虫等三种。这样就决定了对小麦病虫害采取的三个战役：春播前的一战，主要是用土壤消毒、种籽消毒和处理可能寄生虫茧的新草、禾秸等以消灭地下和越冬病虫；二战是在麦子孕穗后，用捕打和喷射药粉等办法把病虫害消灭在发生之前；最后一战是在入仓前，对种籽进行全部消毒，以彻底消灭病虫害。
    他们把这些经验总结起来以后，又交给群众来进行讨论修改。这样，不仅使这些经验得到了进一步地丰富和发展，还加深了群众对防治病虫害的重要性的认识，从而在全社掀起了热烈的巧战病虫害的群众运动。在“土壤不施药不下种、种籽不消毒不下种”的口号下，全社两万多亩地的麦种和一万多亩地的大麻种都做到了温汤浸种，赛力散拌种，一亩地施六六六粉三斤，并且处理了田间所有的杂草和禾秸，使病虫害一举消灭在发生之前。
    现在，该社正抓紧培训专业组长和技术员，计划组织一个拥有一千二百多人的防治网，这说明第二个战役又将胜利展开。
