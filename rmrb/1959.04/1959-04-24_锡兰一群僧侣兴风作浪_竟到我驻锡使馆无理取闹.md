Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd, Colombo dispatch: Recently in Ceylon, a group of Buddhist monks, supported by the pro-Western United National Party, have been stirring up trouble and making unreasonable demands in the wake of the Tibetan rebellion.

On the afternoon of April 10th, about ten monks of unknown origin went to the Chinese Embassy in Ceylon to submit a so-called "protest letter." Prior to this, the monks held a meeting in the pharmacy of Mallawana Gnanasara Thero, a well-known supporter of the United National Party. (According to a report by the Indian Press Trust, six hundred people attended the meeting).

Their so-called "protest letter" slandered the Chinese government for destroying Buddhist temples and imprisoning monks. Disregarding the fact that Tibet is part of China, they absurdly demanded that "Chinese troops withdraw from Tibet." The Chinese Embassy resolutely refused to accept this letter which interfered in China's internal affairs.

This group of monks also decided to organize a series of public gatherings across Ceylon to incite the Ceylonese people and Buddhists against China.

On the very same day, a new monks' organization was hastily established, called the "Buddhist Monks' Association." The secretary of this association is none other than that supporter of the United National Party—Gnanasara. This organization immediately wrote letters to Buddhist leaders in Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, South Vietnam, and Laos, attempting to incite monks in Southeast Asian Buddhist countries against China, undermining the relationship between China and these countries, thereby serving the imperialists' purpose of creating tension and intensifying aggression in this region.

    锡兰一群僧侣兴风作浪
    竟到我驻锡使馆无理取闹
    新华社23日讯　科伦坡消息：最近锡兰有一群佛教僧侣在亲西方的统一国民党的支持下，在西藏叛乱事件后兴风作浪，无理取闹。
    4月10日下午，大约有十名来历不明的僧侣到中国驻锡兰大使馆提交所谓“抗议书”。在这以前，僧侣们在统一国民党著名的支持者马勒瓦纳·格纳尼萨拉和尚的药铺里开了一个会。（据印度报业托辣斯的报道说出席这个会的有六百人）。
    他们的所谓“抗议书”污蔑中国政府破坏佛庙，监禁僧侣。他们不顾西藏是中国的一部分的事实，荒谬地要求“中国军队撤出西藏”。中国大使馆断然拒绝接受这一干涉中国内政的信件。
    这群僧侣还决定在锡兰全国组织一系列的公众集会，煽动锡兰人民和佛教徒反对中国。
    就在这一天，一个新的僧侣组织匆匆忙忙成立了，叫做“佛教僧侣协会”。这个协会的秘书就是那个统一国民党的支持者——格纳尼萨拉。这个组织立即写信给泰国、缅甸、柬埔寨、南越和老挝的佛教领袖，企图煽动东南亚佛教国家僧侣反对中国，破坏中国和这些国家的关系，从而为帝国主义者在这一地区制造紧张局势和加紧侵略的目的服务。
