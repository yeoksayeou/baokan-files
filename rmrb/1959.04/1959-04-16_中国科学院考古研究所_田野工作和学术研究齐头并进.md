    Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Archaeology
	Fieldwork and Academic Research Advance Simultaneously
    In order to adapt to the new situation of archaeological work blossoming everywhere after the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural construction, and to further carry out investigations and excavations and to organize and publish the large amount of valuable data accumulated over the past few years, this year the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in addition to continuing to cooperate with basic construction and vigorously carry out fieldwork, has also allocated sufficient resources to write investigation and excavation reports and conduct comprehensive academic research.
    In the first half of this year, the institute organized a total of fourteen fieldwork teams (Shandong Team, Shanxi Team, Gansu Team, Qinghai Team, Anyang Team, Luoyang Team, Shanxian Team, Huayin Team, Hancheng Team, Tangcheng Team, Fengxi Team, Weihe Team, Yangtze River Directly Subordinate Team, Xia Dynasty Culture Investigation Team), which successively departed at the end of February and the beginning of March to carry out work in Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Sichuan and other provinces. The objects of investigation and excavation include Neolithic Age sites (Yangshao Culture, Longshan Culture, Neolithic cultures in the Yangtze River basin, etc.), Xia, Shang, Zhou, Two Han, Sui and Tang dynasties, as well as cultural sites and tombs in minority areas of the Northwest. This work will play a very beneficial role in gradually establishing a complete system of Chinese archaeology.
    In terms of writing investigation and excavation reports and comprehensive research, it is planned to complete three works before National Day: "Ten Years of Archaeology in New China," "A General History of China (Primitive Society Section)," and "Historical Atlas of China (Primitive Society and Slave Society Section)." In addition, ten investigation and excavation reports will be compiled, including "Yellow River Reservoir Report (Miaodigou Section)," "Yellow River Reservoir Report (Sanmenxia Section)," "Excavation Report of the Guo State Cemetery," "Banpo Excavation Report," "Xi'an Fengxi Excavation Report," "Excavation Report of the Tang Daming Palace," "Excavation Report of Sui and Tang Tombs in the Suburbs of Xi'an," "Investigation and Excavation Report on Both Banks of the Jian River in Luoyang," "Jingshan Excavation Report in Hubei," and "Handan Excavation Report." These reports include the institute's main investigation and excavation work in recent years. Among them, the "Banpo Excavation Report" will report on the data of a more typical Neolithic Yangshao culture village site; the "Xi'an Fengxi Excavation Report" will provide important data for studying the Western Zhou culture in China; and the "Excavation Report of the Tang Daming Palace" and the "Excavation Report of Sui and Tang Tombs in the Suburbs of Xi'an" will provide valuable data for the study of Tang Dynasty history. Other reports also have certain scientific value. The completion of this plan means that the data obtained from the institute's investigations and excavations in recent years have been basically organized.

    中国科学院考古研究所
　　田野工作和学术研究齐头并进
    中国科学院考古研究所为适应工农业建设大跃进后考古工作遍地开花的新形势，进一步开展调查发掘工作和整理发表几年来积累下来的大量珍贵资料，今年他们除了继续配合基本建设，大力开展田野工作外，还配备了足够的力量编写调查发掘报告和进行综合的学术研究。
    今年上半年该所共组织了十四个田野工作队（山东队、山西队、甘肃队、青海队、安阳队、洛阳队、陕县队、华阴队、汉城队、唐城队、沣西队、渭河队、长江直属队、夏代文化调查队），并已于2月底3月初先后出发到山东、山西、甘肃、青海、河南、陕西、湖北、四川等省展开工作。调查发掘的对象，包括新石器时代（仰韶文化、龙山文化、长江流域的新石器文化等）、夏、商、周、两汉、隋唐以及西北少数民族地区的文化遗址和墓葬。这些工作对于逐步建立完备的中国考古学的系统，将起十分有益的作用。
    在编写调查发掘报告和综合研究方面，计划在国庆节前，完成“新中国十年考古”、“中国通史（原始社会部分）”和“中国历史图谱（原始社会和奴隶社会部分）”三项著作。此外，还将编写出“黄河水库报告（庙底沟部分）”、“黄河水库报告（三门峡部分）”、“虢国墓地发掘报告”、“半坡发掘报告”、“西安沣西发掘报告”、“唐大明宫发掘报告”、“西安郊区隋唐墓葬发掘报告”、“洛阳涧河两岸调查发掘报告”、“湖北京山发掘报告”、“邯郸发掘报告”等十个调查发掘报告。这些报告包括了近几年来该所主要的调查发掘工作。其中如“半坡发掘报告”将报道较典型的新石器时代仰韶文化的村落遗址的资料；“西安沣西发掘报告”将提供研究我国西周文化的重要资料；“唐大明宫发掘报告”和“西安郊区隋唐墓葬发掘报告”对唐代历史的研究将提供宝贵的资料。其他各报告也都有一定的科学价值。这个计划的完成意味着该所几年来调查发掘所得的资料，基本上都得到了整理。
