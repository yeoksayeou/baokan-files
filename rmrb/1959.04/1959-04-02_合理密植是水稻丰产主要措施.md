Rational Close Planting is the Main Measure for High Rice Yield
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

In 1958, China's total rice output surged from 173.5 billion jin in 1957 to about 300 billion jin, and the yield per unit area increased from an average of 358 jin per mu to 620 jin, an increase of 73%. This is not only an unprecedented miracle in the history of rice production in China but also in the history of rice production worldwide. Compared with Japan and Italy, countries famous for rice production, Japan's rice yield per unit area has increased by only about 80% in the past 70 years since 1882. In 1958, Japan's 48,795,000 mu of rice fields averaged 620.3 jin per mu. In Italy, the rice planting area in 1958 was 1,995,000 mu, with an average yield of 701.7 jin per mu. In 1958, China's rice field area totaled 480 million mu, and the average yield per mu also approached this level. In terms of the highest yield per unit area, a large number of high-yield fields with more than 2,000 jin have appeared in various parts of China, far exceeding Japan's highest record of more than 1,640 jin per mu in 1955.

Confirming Increased Production Through Close Planting

Increasing transplanting density was the central link in China's bumper rice harvest in 1958. On the basis of deep plowing and increased fertilization, the transplanting density broke through the conventional norms and achieved a creative development, which greatly promoted the great leap forward in rice yield per unit area.

In the past, some experienced farmers believed that "sparse planting yields three dan, dense planting yields six baskets, but the final result is about the same." Some scientific researchers also believed that increasing the number of rice seedlings per mu to more than 20,000 to 30,000 would result in limited or no increase in production, and even a tendency to decrease production. However, in 1958, various regions, on the basis of focusing on water, fertilizer, and deep plowing, greatly exceeded the above range in transplanting density. In advanced areas, early and mid-season rice were transplanted at 30,000 to 50,000 seedlings per mu, with 250,000 to 400,000 seedlings; double-cropping late rice was transplanted at 40,000 to 80,000 seedlings, with 400,000 to 600,000 seedlings, doubling or even several times more than in 1957. For example, early double-cropping rice in Anhui Province was transplanted at 33,000 seedlings per mu, twice as much as in 1957, with an average yield of 1,028 jin per mu, an increase of 182% compared to 1957. From the comparative data of close planting in various regions in 1958, it can be seen that with deep plowing, increased fertilization, and other measures followed up, not only did the common planting of 30,000 to 40,000 seedlings per mu increase production, but the planting of 50,000 to 60,000 seedlings per mu resulted in even more significant increases in production. Relying on the Main Panicle is the Main Feature of Increased Production

Relying on the main panicle is the main feature of China's increased rice production through close planting in 1958. China's advanced farmers have realized from production practice that increasing the number of panicles and grains per unit area is the key to achieving increased rice production. Inspired by the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, they further realized that it is necessary to rely on the growth of the main panicle to increase the number of panicles, so that increased production can be reliably guaranteed. The large-row sparse planting method adopted in the past and the small-row close planting method promoted in recent years are both methods of increasing the total number of panicles per unit area by relying on tillering growth. These methods make it difficult to double rice production on a large scale. For example, late double-cropping rice in Guangsi County, Guangdong Province, was transplanted at 20,000 seedlings per mu in 1957, with 100,000 seedlings, and the average yield per mu was only more than 200 jin. In 1958, some high-yield fields used a row spacing of 5x1 inch, with four to six seedlings per row, and the average total number of panicles per mu reached about 600,000. With the cooperation of other measures, the yield per mu jumped to about 2,000 jin. The highest record of rice yield in Japan is mainly obtained by relying on tillering panicles. Converted to China's unit area calculation, they only transplant 12,000 seedlings per mu, with 24,000 seedlings. As a result, although each seedling obtained an average of 28.2 panicles, the total number of panicles per mu was still only about 320,000, with an average of 94.1 grains per panicle, and the yield was only 1,640 jin. (See page 663 of the May 1955 issue of the Japanese "Agriculture and Horticulture" magazine. The original yield was 1,014.6 kg of brown rice per tan, which was converted to rice by Mr. Yamada Noboru of the Japanese Agricultural Technology Visiting Group as the above number.)

The main reasons why it is impossible to obtain higher yields by relying on tillering are: first, the number of panicles is not guaranteed. Under the influence of climate and other conditions, it is often impossible to reach the number of panicles necessary to create high yields; second, since a large number of tillers must be relied upon, it is difficult to control the increase in the ineffective tillering rate, resulting in the consumption of a large amount of nutrients, hindering the full development of effective panicles; third, the heading is uneven, the panicle shapes are different in size, the maturity is delayed, and the empty grain rate increases; fourth, the large number of ineffective tillers will increase the humidity between the rice plants, affecting ventilation and light transmission, and hindering the normal growth of the plants. After close planting, the number of tillers decreases, and the proportion of the main panicle increases accordingly. According to a survey of single-cropping late rice fields in the Liangzhong Breeding Farm in Jinshan County, Jiangsu Province: the highest tillering rate for 300,000 seedlings transplanted per mu was 46%, while that for 800,000 seedlings was only 0.6%. Due to the reduction in tillering, the nutrients of the plants can be concentrated to supply the development of the main panicle, which is more conducive to the formation of large panicles and fully exerts the yield increase potential of individuals. According to a survey of high-yield early rice fields in the Taiping Agricultural Cooperative in Liling County, Hunan, the variety is Nantie No. 1, and the average number of grains in the main panicle is 161.5, which is 79% more than the tillering panicle, and the unfilled rate is only 17.4%, which is 43% less than the tillering panicle. In last year's bumper rice harvest, the huge potential of relying on main panicle close planting for increased production, both in production practice and cultivation science theory, has been unanimously recognized by farmers and agricultural scientific and technical workers, and has become a unique symbol of China's high-yield rice cultivation technology.

Reasonable Density is the Key to Increased Production

Close planting is our direction, and the huge yield increase effect of close planting has been proven by the fact of the bumper rice harvest in 1958. However, close planting is not isolated, not without limits, and certainly not the denser the better. Close planting is only one of the measures in the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, and it is closely related to the other seven measures and climatic environmental conditions. Different soil, fertilizer, water, and seed conditions, and different cultivation technology conditions, have different reasonable densities. In the past, under the conditions of shallow plowing, less fertilizer, and extensive management, it was generally believed that 10,000 to 20,000 seedlings per mu was a reasonable density; if this density was exceeded, the rice panicles would be significantly reduced, and phenomena such as lodging and seedling death would occur. However, in 1958, under the leadership and education of the Party, Chinese farmers liberated their minds and carried out a technical revolution of deep plowing, increased fertilization, and fine management, and the situation was completely different. Forty-eight single-cropping late rice fields in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, had an average of 67.03 grains per panicle for 250,000 panicles per mu, and 67.17 grains per panicle for 300,000 panicles. The number of panicles increased by 50,000 (one-fifth), and the number of grains per panicle did not decrease; 62.46 grains per panicle for 350,000 panicles per mu, and 59.86 grains per panicle for 700,000 panicles. The number of panicles doubled, and the number of grains per panicle decreased by only 4.2%. More than 5,500 mu of single-cropping late rice fields in the Chengdong People's Commune in Songjiang County, Shanghai, were transplanted at about 40,000 seedlings per mu, twice as much as in 1957. They did not lodge until maturity, and the average yield per mu was 1,388 jin. These materials show that with the improvement of production conditions and the improvement of cultivation technology, the contradiction between the number of panicles and the number of grains can be adjusted and unified within a certain close planting range, and the problems of lodging and seedling death can also be prevented. On the other hand, last year, there were also a few experimental fields where deep plowing was not carried out before close planting, and because measures such as drainage and irrigation and fertilization were not followed up after close planting, the increase in production was not significant, and the phenomenon of short panicles and small grains still existed, and even lodging and seedling death occurred, resulting in reduced production. Therefore, starting from the current specific production conditions and technical conditions, taking reasonable transplanting density, methods, and methods is a meticulous task that requires both soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis. Correctly solving this problem is of great significance for striving for a greater rice harvest in 1959.

We believe that when determining transplanting density, various conditions such as variety, fertilizer, labor force, and cultivation technology level must be considered. According to local experience, early rice should be appropriately denser than late rice, double-cropping rice should be denser than single-cropping rice, japonica rice should be denser than indica rice, fertilizer-sufficient areas should be denser than fertilizer-deficient areas, and late transplanting should be denser than early and timely transplanting; areas with insufficient labor should also consider the allocation of transplanting labor when determining the degree of close planting. It is not possible to simply pursue close planting and delay the transplanting season, which will not result in a significant increase in production. In 1958, the transplanting density of most rice fields in the country reached 30,000 to 50,000 seedlings per mu, with 250,000 to 400,000 seedlings, and the average yield of large-area high-yield fields was more than 1,000 to 1,500 jin per mu. This is a huge leap forward, and such a density is more in line with China's current production conditions. Efforts should be made to further improve close planting cultivation technology, implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, and fully exploit the yield increase potential of close planting. As for the issue of whether to rely on the main panicle and still have tillering, our opinion is that we should rely on the main panicle and also strive for partial tillering. Appropriate tillering can promote the growth of rice roots and is conducive to the healthy growth of rice plants. Therefore, from the overall situation of the country, it is more appropriate to adopt about 50,000 seedlings per mu, with 400,000 to 500,000 seedlings, and strive for 500,000 to 600,000 panicles for large-area adoption in 1959.

Promote Strip Planting

The "Full Sky of Stars" transplanting method was one of the important reasons for seedling death in some rice fields in 1958. The commonly used square small-row close planting in the past also has serious shortcomings such as too small row spacing, early closure in the field, poor ventilation and light transmission, and weak plant growth after the degree of close planting is further improved, which is limited in specific applications. Judging from the various transplanting methods created by the masses in various regions in 1958, single-row strip planting is more suitable for a density of about 50,000 seedlings per mu. For example, if a row spacing of 5 to 6 inches and a seedling spacing of 2 to 2.5 inches are used, with 8 to 10 seedlings per seedling, the number of seedlings and seedlings can be greatly increased, and a certain row spacing can be maintained, which is convenient for ventilation and light transmission and field operation management. With the cooperation of other yield increase measures, the rice plants can grow healthily, the effective tillering rate is high, and it is more certain to strive to reach 500,000 to 600,000 panicles. In areas where the number of rice seedlings per mu does not reach 50,000, rectangular planting can also be considered in order to strive for more effective tillering to increase the total number of panicles per unit area and achieve the purpose of increasing production. As for methods such as double-row strip planting and compartment planting, they are not only labor-intensive and inconvenient to operate, but also have poor ventilation and light transmission in the field, and are prone to excessive growth, lodging, and even seedling death, and cannot be adopted on a large scale at present.

Appropriately Increase the Amount of Seeds Sown in Seedling Fields

In solving the problem of seedling supply after increasing the degree of close planting, various regions have gained a lot of experience last year, especially on the basis of the widespread use of moist seedling fields or semi-dry seedling fields, increasing the amount of seeds sown in seedling fields, and cultivating tender and strong seedlings. In the past, the amount of seeds sown in early rice seedling fields was mostly 120 to 200 jin per mu, 100 to 150 jin for mid-season rice or single-cropping late rice in the south, and 60 to 80 jin for double-cropping late rice. When this sparse sowing method is adopted, when the amount of seeds used per mu of the field is increased from less than 10 jin to 20 to 30 jin, the required seedling field area is too large, and many difficulties occur. Therefore, many advanced areas that promote close planting have adopted the method of increasing the amount of seeds sown in seedling fields. According to the experiment on the amount of seeds sown in early rice seedling fields in Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, densely sowing more than 600 jin per mu of seedling field (about 20 grains of rice per square inch), as long as the management of the seedling field is strengthened, and tender seedlings are transplanted early, the yield is similar to that of sowing 200 to 300 jin per mu under close planting conditions. The reason why the yield of dense sowing in seedling fields is not lower than that of sparse sowing is that the area of nutrition required for tender seedlings is small. There is no crowding or closure, which ensures that the seedlings are healthy.

However, how much the amount of seeds sown per mu of seedling field can be increased must be studied and determined in a realistic manner according to local conditions. For example, the double-cropping late rice in the Yangtze River Basin needs to cultivate old and strong seedlings due to the use of single-cropping late rice varieties with a longer growth period, and sparse sowing of seedling fields is still necessary; however, some areas have changed to using early rice and mid-season rice varieties with a shorter growth period for double-cropping late rice cultivation, which has created conditions for shortening the seedling age and cultivating young and strong seedlings, and the amount of seeds sown can be appropriately increased; in addition, the climate is relatively cool during the seedling raising season for early rice, and the seedlings grow slowly but are firmer, and the amount of seeds sown in the seedling field can be slightly more; the climate is hot during the seedling raising season for late rice, and the seedlings grow quickly. At the same time, the amount of seeds sown is closely related to the transplanting density. On the one hand, the number of seedlings required after close planting has greatly increased, and on the other hand, the yield increase effect of sparse sowing in seedling fields is not so obvious after close planting; therefore, the amount of seeds sown in seedling fields with a large transplanting density can be slightly more than that of a small density. If the amount of seeds sown in the seedling field in 1959 is considered according to the range of about 50,000 seedlings per mu, we believe that the amount of seeds sown in early rice seedling fields in northern rice areas and the Yangtze River Basin can be increased to about 300 jin per mu (equivalent to about 12 grains per square inch of net seedling field area), about 200 jin per mu for early double-cropping rice in South China, and up to 300 jin per mu for mid-season rice in the Yangtze River Basin, and about 80 to 150 jin per mu for late double-cropping rice, which is more appropriate.

Finally, it must be emphasized that the transplanting density and the amount of seeds sown in seedling fields we have proposed above are only based on general situations. Due to the different environmental conditions and production conditions in various parts of the country, it is impossible to meet the requirements of every place. Reasonable transplanting density, amount of seeds sown in seedling fields, and necessary cultivation technology management measures should be decided by various regions starting from the specific conditions of the local area, referring to foreign experience, and studying together with the peasant masses.

The bumper harvest in 1958 not only has great economic and political significance, but also developed a set of high-yield rice cultivation technologies centered on close planting that are suitable for China's production great leap forward, and made great contributions to China's agricultural science. However, it must also be seen that in order to further improve the yield per unit area, strive for a greater harvest, and gradually realize the policy of "high yield, less planting, and more harvesting", there are still many problems to be solved, such as the reasonable density under different conditions, deep plowing of rice fields, fertilization, and irrigation technology. The infinite potential of China's rice production has just begun to be tapped, and greater miracles and prospects, and higher creations and achievements, are waiting for us!

    合理密植是水稻丰产主要措施
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    1958年我国水稻总产量从1957年的一千七百三十五亿斤，猛增到三千亿斤左右，单位面积产量由平均亩产三百五十八斤增至六百二十斤，增产幅度达73％，这不仅是我国水稻生产史上，也是世界稻作生产史上从未有过的奇迹。拿产稻著名的国家日本和意大利相比，日本水稻单位面积产量，从1882年至今的七十余年来，仅增加了80％左右；1958年日本全国四千八百七十九万五千亩稻田，平均亩产六百二十点三斤。意大利1958年全国水稻种植面积为一百九十九万五千亩，平均亩产量为七百零一点七斤。而1958年我国稻田面积共四亿八千万亩，总平均亩产量也已接近这个水平。如以单位面积最高产量比较，我国各地大量出现了二千斤以上的高额丰产田，更远远超过了日本在1955年所创造的亩产一千六百四十多斤的最高纪录。
    肯　定　密　植　增　产
    提高插秧密度是1958年我国水稻大丰收的中心环节。在深耕、增肥的基础上，插秧密度突破了常规，来一个创造性的发展，这就大大地促进了水稻单位面积产量的大跃进。
    过去有些老农的经验，认为“稀三担，密六箩，敲敲打打一样多”。有些科学工作者的试验研究结果，也认为每亩插秧穴数超过二至三万穴，即增产有限，或不能增产，甚至还有减产的倾向。而1958年各地在抓水、抓肥、抓深耕的基础上，插秧密度大大超过了上述范围。先进地区早、中稻每亩插到三至五万穴，二十五至四十万苗；双季晚稻插到四至八万穴，四十至六十万苗，比1957年增加一倍甚至几倍。如安徽省双季早稻每亩插秧三万三千穴，比1957年增加了一倍，平均每亩产量达一千零二十八斤，比1957年增产182％。从1958年各地的密植对比材料来看，在深耕增肥等措施跟上的情况下，不仅每亩插三至四万穴的普遍增产，插五至六万穴增产更显著。依靠主穗是增产的主要特点
    依靠主穗是1958年我国水稻密植增产的主要特点。我国先进的农民从生产实践中认识到，增加单位面积上的穗数、粒数是实现水稻增产的主要关键。在苏联先进经验的启发下，进一步认识到必须依靠主穗成长来增加穗数，增产才有可靠的保证。过去所采用的大株稀植和近年来推行的小株密植，都是依靠分蘖成长来增加单位面积内总穗数的办法，这些方法很难使水稻产量在大面积上加倍的提高。如广东省广四县双季晚稻，1957年亩插二万穴，十万苗，平均亩产只有二百多斤；1958年有些丰产田用5×1寸的行株距，每穴插四至六苗，平均每亩总穗数达六十万左右，在其他措施配合下，亩产量跃增到二千斤左右。而日本最高纪录的水稻产量，是主要依靠分蘖穗获得的。折合我国单位面积计算，他们每亩只插一万二千穴，二万四千苗，结果每穴虽平均获得了二十八点二个穗子，但每亩总穗数仍只有三十二万左右，平均每穗九十四点一粒，产量也只是一千六百四十斤。（见日本“农业及园艺”杂志1955年5月号六百六十三页，原文产量为每反糙米一千零十四点六公斤，经日本农业技术访华团山田登先生折合稻谷如上数。）
    依靠分蘖不可能获得更高产量的主要原因，首先是穗数没有保证，在气候等条件的影响下，常常不能达到创造高产所必须的穗数；其次，既要依靠大量分蘖，也就很难控制无效分蘖率的增长，以至耗费大量营养物质，妨碍有效穗的充分发育；第三，抽穗不齐，穗形大小不一，成熟延迟，空壳率增加；第四，无效分蘖数多，会增加稻棵间的湿度，影响通风透光，妨碍植株的正常生育。而密植后，分蘖减少，主穗所占的比重即随着增加。据江苏省金山县良种繁殖场单季晚稻田调查：每亩插三十万苗的最高分蘖率为46％，而插八十万苗的只有0.6％。由于分蘖减少，植株的营养物质可以集中供给主穗发育，更利于形成大穗，充分发挥个体的增产潜力。据湖南醴陵县太平农业社早稻高产田调查，品种为南特号，主穗粒数平均一百六十一点五粒，比分蘖穗多79％，不实率只17.4％，比分蘖穗少43％。在去年水稻大丰收中，依靠主穗密植增产的巨大潜力，不论在生产实践上或栽培科学理论上，各地农民和农业科学技术工作者取得了一致的认识，并且已成为我国水稻丰产栽培技术的独特标志。
  合理密度是增产的关键
    密植是我们的方向，密植的巨大增产作用也已为1958年水稻密植大丰收的事实证明。但是，密植不是孤立的，不是没有限度的，更不是越密越好。密植仅是农业生产“八字宪法”中的一项措施，它和其他七项措施以及气候环境条件有着密切的联系。不同的土、肥、水、种等条件，不同的栽培技术条件，就有不同的合理密度。过去在浅耕、少肥、管理粗放的条件下，一般认为每亩一、二万穴是合理密度；如果超过这个密度，稻穗就要显著减少，就会发生倒伏、死苗等现象。然而，1958年我国农民在党的领导和教育下，解放了思想，大搞深耕、增肥、精细管理的技术革命后，情况完全不同了。江苏省常熟县四十八块单季晚稻，每亩二十五万穗的每穗平均六十七点零三粒，三十万穗的六十七点一七粒，穗数增加五万（五分之一），而每穗粒数都未减少；每亩三十五万穗的六十二点四六粒，七十万穗的五十九点八六粒，穗数增加一倍，而每穗粒数只减少4.2％。上海市郊松江县城东人民公社五千五百多亩单季晚稻田，每亩插四万穴左右，比1957年提高了一倍，直到成熟也未倒伏，平均亩产一千三百八十八斤。这些材料说明，生产条件改善了，栽培技术提高了，在一定密植范围内，穗数和粒数的矛盾可以得到调整和统一，倒伏、死苗的问题也可以防止。另一方面，去年也有少数试验田，因为密植前没有进行深翻地，密植后又由于排灌、施肥等措施没有跟上，增产幅度不大，穗短粒小的现象还是存在的，甚至还发生了倒伏、死苗等情况，反而造成减产。因此，从当前的具体生产条件和技术条件出发，采取合理的插秧密度、方式和方法，是一件既要有冲天干劲、又要有科学分析的细致工作，正确解决这个问题，对于争取1959年水稻更大丰收具有十分重要的意义。
    我们认为确定插秧密度时，必须考虑到品种、肥料、劳动力及栽培技术水平等各种条件。根据各地经验，早稻比晚稻、双季稻比单季稻、粳稻比秈稻、肥料充足的比肥料较少的、迟插的比早插和适时栽插的应适当密一些；劳动力不足的地区，在确定密植程度时更要考虑到插秧劳力的调配问题，不能单纯追求密植，延误插秧季节，反而得不到显著增产的效果。1958年全国大部分稻田的插秧密度每亩达到了三至五万穴，二十五至四十万苗，大面积丰产田平均亩产一千至一千五百斤以上。这是一个巨大的跃进，这样的密度是比较符合我国当前生产条件的。应该努力进一步提高密植栽培技术，贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”，充分发挥密植的增产潜力。至于依靠主穗是否还要分蘖的问题，我们的意见是应依靠主穗，还要争取部分分蘖，适当分蘖能促进稻根生长，有利稻株生长健壮。因此，从全国总的情况看来，1959年大面积采用亩插五万穴左右、四十至五十万苗，争取五十至六十万穗比较适宜。
        推广条式栽插
    “满天星”的插秧方式，曾是1958年某些稻田发生死苗的重要原因之一。过去常用的方形小株密植，也由于密植程度进一步提高后，行距太小，田间早期郁闭，通风透光不良，植株生长软弱，不便管理等严重缺点，在具体应用上受到一定的限制。以1958年各地群众所创造的各种插秧方式看来，以单行条插比较适宜于亩插五万穴左右的密度。如采用行距五至六寸，株距二寸至二寸半，每穴插八至十苗，这样，既可大大增加穴数和苗数，又可保持一定的行距，便于通风透光和田间操作管理，在其他增产措施配合下，可以使稻株生长健壮，有效分蘖率高，争取达到五十至六十万穗也较有把握。在每亩插秧穴数达不到五万穴的地区，还可考虑采用长方形栽插方式，以便争取较多的有效分蘖来增加单位面积内的总穗数，达到增产的目的。至于双行条插和分厢栽插等方式，不仅是费工多，操作不便，而且田间通风透光不良，容易发生徒长倒伏甚至死苗的现象，也不是目前大面积可以采用的。
    适当增加秧田播种量
    在解决提高密植程度后的秧苗供应问题上，去年各地取得了很多经验，特别是普遍采用了湿润秧田或半旱秧田的基础上，增加秧田播种量，培育嫩壮秧的方法。过去早稻秧田播种量大都是每亩一百二十至二百斤，南方中稻或单季晚稻一百至一百五十斤，双季晚稻为六十至八十斤。采用这种稀播的办法，在推行密植，每亩本田用种量从十斤以下，提高到二十至三十斤的程度时，要求秧田面积过大，发生很多困难，因此，许多推行密植的先进地区，都采取了增加秧田播种量的办法。根据湖南、湖北、四川早稻秧田播种量试验，每亩秧田密播六百斤以上（每平方寸约有二十多粒稻谷），只要加强秧田管理，并早插嫩秧，在密植条件下，与每亩播二百至三百斤的产量相类似。秧田密播后产量不低于稀播的原因，是由于嫩秧所需要的营养面积较小。不致于发生拥挤郁闭，从而保证了秧苗健壮。
    但一亩秧田的播种量究竟可以增加到多少，各地还必须因地制宜，实事求是来研究确定。如长江流域的双季晚稻，由于采用了生长期较长的单季晚稻品种，需要培育老壮秧，秧田稀播仍有必要；但有些地区已改用生长期较短的早稻和中稻品种作双季晚稻栽培，为缩短秧龄，培育幼壮秧创造了条件，就可以适当增加播种量；又如早稻的育秧季节气温比较凉爽，秧苗生长缓慢但较坚实，秧田播种量就可以稍多一些；晚稻育秧季节气候炎热，秧苗长得快，播种太密时，容易发生徒长，播种量就应该稍少一些。同时，播种量和插秧密度也有密切的关系，一方面是密植后需要的秧苗数大大增加了，另一方面是密植后，秧田稀播的增产作用也不是那样明显；因此，插秧密度大的比密度小的秧田播种量可以稍多一些。1959年的秧田播种量，如果按亩插五万穴左右的范围考虑，我们认为北方稻区和长江流域早稻秧田播种量可以增加到每亩三百斤左右（折合净秧田面积每平方寸十二粒左右），华南双季早稻每亩二百斤左右，长江流域中稻每亩可到三百斤，双季晚稻每亩八十至一百五十斤左右，是比较恰当的。
    最后还必须强调指出，我们上面所提出的插秧密度和秧田播种量，只不过就一般情况提出的。由于全国各地的环境条件和生产条件的不同，不可能适合每一个地方的要求。合理的插秧密度、秧田播种量以及必要栽培技术管理措施，各地还应该从当地的具体条件出发，参考外地经验，通过和农民群众一起研究来决定。
    1958年的大丰收，不仅具有伟大的经济意义和政治意义，而且发展了以密植为中心的一套适合我国生产大跃进的水稻丰产栽培技术，为我国农业科学作出了巨大的贡献。但是，还必须看到，为了更进一步提高单位面积产量，争取更大的丰收，并逐步实现“高产、少种、多收”的方针，还有许多问题，如不同条件的合理密度、稻田的深翻、施肥、灌溉技术等方面都有待进一步解决。我国水稻生产的无穷潜力，正开始挖掘，更伟大的奇迹和前景，更高度的创造和成就，正在等待我们！
