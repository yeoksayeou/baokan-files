Xinhua News Agency — Recently, the Ministry of Aquatic Products and the Aquatic Group of the State Scientific and Technological Commission jointly convened the National Aquatic Science and Technology Work Conference, proposing to organize comprehensive large-scale collaboration in aquatic production and scientific and technological work in order to solve key technical problems in aquatic production quickly and well.

The conference held that current focus in aquatic science and technology should be on studying the cultivation of new and improved aquaculture breeds, researching and resolving aquatic feed sources, expanding the scope of aquatic production, and fully utilizing aquatic resources, so as to ensure a major development in aquatic production this year, and at the same time rapidly improve the level of aquatic science and technology in our country. To this end, the conference determined to organize special groups to study the artificial controlled incubation of grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, and common carp; to manufacture simple, practical, and mass-producible hormones in order to solve the problem of raising grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp and other fish species in northern areas and greatly develop other freshwater fish farming; to conduct research on the rapid growth of fish, and to promote the increase of aquatic production nationwide; and to study the fishing technology and tools for pelagic fish in the sea in order to meet the needs of the vast coastal fishermen. In addition, regarding the already established leading group for marine aquatic resources surveys, the conference required all provinces and cities to continue to cooperate fully and strive to basically complete the survey of coastal aquatic resources in the near future in order to expand new fishing grounds.

The conference also decided to establish an editorial committee for "Freshwater Fish Farming," to organize forces from all aspects, to summarize our country's rich fish farming experience over thousands of years and the high-yield techniques created by the masses in the Great Leap Forward, and to compile them into a book.

    全国水产科学技术工作会议
    提出水产中的研究课题
    新华社讯最近，水产部和国家科学技术委员会水产组联合召开了全国水产科学技术工作会议，提出在水产生产和科学技术工作中组织全面的大协作，以便又快又好地解决水产生产中的关键性技术问题。
    会议认为，当前在水产科学技术方面应着重研究培养新的优良养殖品种、研究解决水产饲料来源、扩大水产生产领域、充分利用水中资源等问题，以保证今年的水产生产大发展，同时迅速提高我国水产科学技术的水平。为此，会上确定了组织专门小组，研究青、草、鲢、鳙的人工控制孵化问题，制造简单实用而又能大量生产的激素，以便解决在北方养殖草、鲢、鳙等鱼类和大量发展其他淡水养鱼事业；进行鱼类快速成长的研究，推动全国水产增产；研究海水中上层鱼类的捕捞技术和工具问题，以适应沿海广大渔民的需要。此外，对已经成立的海洋水产资源调查领导小组，会议要求各省市继续通力合作，争取在近期内基本完成沿海水产资源的调查工作，以扩大新渔场。
    这次会议还决定成立“淡水养鱼学”编写委员会，组织各方面的力量，总结我国几千年来丰富的养鱼经验和大跃进中群众创造的高额丰产技术，编写成书。
