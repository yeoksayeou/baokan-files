　　The Ming Tombs Reservoir is Releasing Water!
　　By our correspondents Ning Huanming and Sun Shikai
　　"The Ming Tombs Reservoir is releasing water!" This good news spread like a spring breeze throughout the Ming Tombs People's Commune, and every household was filled with joy. People flocked to the canal from all directions; even the children jumped up with joy. In the past, farmers who had suffered from floods were now watching the surging water of the Wenyu River flowing obediently into their hard-working wheat fields. How could they not be happy!
　　The good news of the water release also excited the people of the capital and all those who care about the Ming Tombs Reservoir. Many people had worked here before, and today they share the joy of their labor. In this season of spring blossoms, tens of thousands of workers, cadres, students, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army took advantage of the holidays to come here from Beijing for spring outings. They climbed the twenty-five-meter-high flood control dam and looked north. The great water was tamed at their feet, turning into a clear, green artificial lake. The lake water gently lapped against the dam; surrounded by mountains, the water and mountains reflected each other. To the south, canals crisscrossed, and spring water flowing from the aqueducts was irrigating the land downstream. The trees planted on Mangshan, Hanbaoshan, Longshan, and Hushan were sprouting new green leaves; along the winding lakeside road, weeping willows and peach trees had been planted at intervals, imitating the embankment of West Lake. In the rippling lake, fish were seen jumping from time to time, and wild ducks were seen falling from the sky.
　　The place where Chairman Mao worked on the reservoir construction site will always attract attention. At the eastern end of the dam, a white marble reservoir monument is being built, with Chairman Mao's inscription "Ming Tombs Reservoir" engraved on the monument, shining brightly in the sun. Not far from the monument, a three-story exhibition hall is also being built, which will display the great achievements of the builders of the Ming Tombs Reservoir.
　　The reservoir management office has received many souvenirs from people all over the country expressing their deep affection. A group of Young Pioneers from Nanjing sent a package of flower seeds. In their letter, the children expressed their love for the Ming Tombs Reservoir. They said they would love to visit the place where Chairman Mao worked, but unfortunately they did not have the opportunity. The letter repeatedly instructed the reservoir management personnel to sow their flower seeds in the place where Chairman Mao worked. A few days ago, Young Pioneers from the Beijing Children's Palace came here blowing trumpets and beating drums, and personally planted a small evergreen cypress tree next to the monument. Fishermen from Hunan also traveled thousands of miles to deliver fish fry.
　　This is the first spring after the completion of the Ming Tombs Reservoir. The farmers who originally lived in the reservoir area in villages such as Guayuan, Dongshankou, and Longmuzhuang have already moved into the new villages they built. The houses in the new villages are spacious, with dense apricot, lilac, and apple trees planted in front of and behind the houses. The evening breeze blowing from the lake carries the rich fragrance of flowers into these happy homes. The old farmer Yu Chenglu, who had been a farmhand for the landlord for his entire life before liberation, thought about the past and looked at the present, and said happily: "Chairman Mao led us to establish people's communes, and built reservoirs and new houses. Life is getting better and better every day."
　　The Ming Tombs Reservoir is irrigating farmland for the first time. On the day of the water release, the members of the Nanshao area of the Ming Tombs People's Commune, who benefited first, came to welcome the water with gongs and drums. Wang Youfu, an eighty-year-old man, leaned on his crutches and said happily to everyone: "This time, our land, which has been suffering from drought nine years out of ten, should be able to drink its fill." Some commune members couldn't help but write such poems: "The reservoir is a treasure bowl, opening canals to bring gold and silver; singing spring songs to irrigate the wheat, striving for one season to equal a year, stepping on the wheat stacks to rise to the ninth heaven."

　　十三陵水库放水啦！
　　本报记者　宁焕明　孙世恺
    “十三陵水库放水啦！”这个喜讯像春风一样吹遍了十三陵人民公社，家家户户喜气洋洋。人们从四面八方拥到渠边；孩子们也都高兴得跳跃起来。过去深受洪水灾害的农民，今天望着滔滔的流水沿着温榆河驯服地流进他们辛勤劳作的麦田，怎么能不高兴呢！
    放水的喜讯也振奋着首都人民和所有关心十三陵水库的人们，许多人曾经在这里劳动过，今天都分享了劳动收获的愉快。在这春暖花开的季节，成千成万的工人、干部、学生和解放军，在假日从北京赶到这里春游。他们登上二十五公尺高的拦洪大坝向北望，大水驯服在脚下，变成了一个碧绿清澈的人工湖，湖水轻轻地拍击着坝身；周围群山环绕，水光山色交相辉映。南边，渠道纵横，从输水道流出的春水正在灌溉着下游的土地。栽植在蟒山、汉包山、龙山和虎山上的树木，吐出一片新绿；沿着弯弯曲曲的环湖路两侧，已仿照西湖的堤岸间隔地栽植着垂柳和桃树；在碧波荡漾的湖水里，时而看到鱼儿跳跃，时儿发现野鸦凌空而落。
    毛主席在水库工地上劳动过的地方永远引人关怀。在大坝东端，正在兴建一座白玉石的水库纪念碑，毛主席为水库题词的“十三陵水库”五个字镌刻在碑身上，迎着太阳闪闪发光。在纪念碑不远的地方，也在兴建一座三层楼的陈列馆，这里将陈列十三陵水库建设者的丰功伟绩。
    水库管理处曾收到各地人民寄来的许多表达深情厚意的纪念品。南京一群少先队员寄来了一包花籽，孩子们在信中表达了热爱十三陵水库的心意，他们说很想到毛主席劳动过的地方来看看，可惜没有机会。信中再三嘱咐水库管理人员要把他们的花籽播种在毛主席劳动过的地方。前些天，北京市少年宫的少先队员们吹号击鼓来到这里，亲手在纪念碑旁栽种了一棵四季长青的小柏树。湖南的渔民们也不远千里送来了鱼苗。
    这是十三陵水库落成后的第一个春天。原来居住在水库区域内的瓜园、东山口、龙母庄等村的农民，已经搬进了他们建设起来的新村。新村的房屋宽敞，房前房后栽种了茂密的杏树、丁香和苹果树，湖边吹来的晚风把浓郁的花香送进这些幸福的人家。解放前给地主当了一辈子长工的老农民于成禄，想想过去看看现在，高兴地说：“毛主席领导我们建立了人民公社，又修水库又盖新房，日子是一天比一天强”。
    十三陵水库第一次放水灌溉农田了，放水的那一天，首先受惠的十三陵人民公社南邵地区的社员们敲锣打鼓赶来迎水，八十岁的老人王有福扶着拐棍高兴地对大家说：“这回咱这十年九旱的土地，可该喝个饱了”。有的社员还情不自禁地写下这样的诗篇：“水库聚宝盆，开渠流金银；唱起春歌把麦灌，力争一季顶一年，脚踏麦垛上九霄。”
