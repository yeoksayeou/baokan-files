    Zipper by the Thousand Inches
    Recently, the Chongwen Zipper Factory in Beijing produced a type of "large zipper" with unfixed length. This zipper can be cut to whatever length is needed. When selling this "large zipper," parts (such as zipper heads and fasteners) are also included to facilitate cutting and installation.

    拉锁长千寸
    最近，北京市崇文拉锁厂生产一种不固定长短尺寸的“大拉锁”。这种拉锁可以根据需要，用多少剪多少。出售这种“大拉锁”时，还附有零件（如拉锁头子、卡扣等），便于剪断安装。
