Currently, both the north and south of the country are in a period of intensive rice seedling cultivation. Strong and full rice seedlings are the first critical step to ensuring a greater bumper harvest. Our farmers have always valued early sowing, as the saying goes, "One early sowing is a hundred early sowings." Early sowing allows for early transplanting and early maturity, and subsequent crops can also be advanced accordingly; in other words, if one crop is early, all crops will be early. Experience has shown that south of the Nanling Mountains, early rice maturing early can avoid rain damage and rice stem borer damage. In the Yangtze River basin, early maturing double-cropping late rice and in northern single-cropping rice areas, can avoid late-stage frost damage. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, due to the promotion of dense planting, which requires more labor, various regions are rushing to sow early in batches to regulate transplanting labor.

This year, the early rice seedling field sowing period is generally ten to fifteen days earlier than last year, and about a month earlier than in the past. For example, south of the Nanling Mountains, sowing generally began during the Greater Cold period, the Yangtze River basin took advantage of the warm weather to sow seeds in early March, and single-cropping rice areas in the north also advanced sowing to late March and early to mid-April. While early sowing is beneficial for increasing production, during this period, temperature changes are drastic, cold and warm are extremely unstable, and it is very easy to cause serious death and rotting of seedlings. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen nurturing.

Rice seedling rot is closely related to germination, land preparation, and management techniques. Especially when sowing is early and the period of drastic temperature changes is long, seedling rot will be even more serious if management is improper. Recently, provinces in the Yangtze River basin may be subject to the invasion of cold air from the north, so it is necessary to vigorously strengthen seedling protection work. Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan, Zhejiang and other provinces attach great importance to climate forecasting in seedling protection work, and adopt fixed personnel, fixed quantity, fixed quality, fixed plot, and regular evaluation methods in seedling field management, which has achieved good results. Specific measures to prevent seedling death and rot include the following:

First, measures to prevent seedling death. When seedlings in moist seedling fields sprout two to three true leaves, they must be watered in time to protect the seedlings. This is an effective way to prevent low temperature and cold wind from invading. Watering can increase water vapor in the seedling field, reduce the loss of radiant heat, and at the same time, water has a large specific heat and slow cooling, which can keep the soil temperature from dropping rapidly. Watering also reduces leaf surface evaporation and lowers soil salinity. In 1958, in Tianjin and Ningbo, Zhejiang, seedlings grew well when water was poured over the seedbed when the seedlings were one to one and a half inches high. Under normal temperatures, watering should be shallow, only deepening when the temperature is too low. After the temperature rises, the water should be gradually drained to facilitate photosynthesis. If frost or ice occurs, water should be poured on the seedlings before sunrise to wash away the frost.

Some areas use oil paper covering or cold bed seedling raising. The specific method is to slightly open the cover in the leeward direction to ventilate and cool down when the temperature inside the bed exceeds 35 degrees Celsius after emergence, in order to exercise the seedlings' resistance to external low temperatures. When two to three true leaves appear, watering is essential to protect the seedlings. Cold bed seedling raising can continue to be covered when the temperature is low, and oil paper seedling raising can use water to regulate the bed temperature.

Second, measures to prevent bud rot and seedling floating. When water seedling fields suffer from low-temperature cold air during the post-sowing germination stage, resulting in bud rot and seedling floating, drainage should be carried out as soon as possible. Cover with rice husk ash, mountain grass ash, fern ash, furnace ash, sand, horse manure or cow dung fragments mixed with soil or chopped green manure, and then cover with oil paper, straw curtains, thatch curtains, etc., to change the water seedling field into a moist seedling field or a moisturizing seedling field, creating ventilated and warm growth and development conditions for the cold-affected seeds to promote root and bud germination. When bud rot is caused by damage from cottony soft rot, algae, rust water, etc., day-drainage and night-irrigation can be adopted, combined with field drying and spraying of double-strength Bordeaux mixture (100 catties of water, half a catty of copper sulfate, one catty of quicklime) at 200 catties per mu, or Xilaisheng quicklime powder (1:10) at 3-4 catties per mu to eliminate cottony soft rot. For algae, copper sulfate can be hung in a cloth bag at the water inlet, 2-3 taels per mu each time, and it can be completely eliminated after 3-4 applications. If there is rust water, change the water frequently. For rice chironomids and mud bagworms, sprinkle 6% BHC mixed with sand or soil (1:100), using 4-5 taels of BHC powder per mu. Maintain a shallow water layer of two to three points on the field surface during application, and change the water within 12-24 hours after application.

During periods of constant temperature fluctuations, it is necessary to increase the water temperature in order to protect the seedlings. According to local experience, setting up sun-drying ponds or sun-drying fields near the seedling field is a relatively common and simple method. Yibin Prefecture in Sichuan Province also uses the method of injecting hot water needles (that is, putting hot water in Nan bamboo tubes into the seedling field) to increase the water temperature. Jiang'an County adopted this method, reducing the incidence of seedling rot from 20% to about 5%. If the low temperature persists, the field smoking method can also be used to increase the temperature of the seedling field.

While doing a good job in protecting seedlings, we must also strive to improve the nutritional conditions of the seedlings to promote thick roots and strong seedlings, rapid greening after transplanting, and early growth, so that each seedling can form a panicle after dense planting, and achieve the goal of large panicles and heavy grains. In addition to shallow water and frequent changes after emergence, it is also necessary to apply quick-acting fertilizers in time. Applying plant ash, pit ash and other fertilizers during the seedling recovery period has a good effect, and also has a lasting effect of eliminating algae, moss and other lower plants. As the seedlings grow, apply ammonium sulfate or diluted human manure, 10-20 catties of ammonium sulfate per mu each time, 3-5 dan of human manure per mu each time. The number of fertilizations should be determined according to the growth of the seedlings, generally 3-4 times. In terms of fertilization technology, we must grasp the principle of less frequent applications, from dilute to concentrated, so that the seedlings do not grow vigorously and maintain a healthy state.

In northern regions with later seasons, some are currently sowing and some are about to sow. They should learn from experience. In addition to paying close attention to the above-mentioned seedling protection work, they should vigorously promote moist seedling fields. In areas with suitable conditions, insulated seedling fields can be used, such as oil paper seedling raising, cold bed seedling raising, and warm bed seedling raising. The sowing period can be appropriately advanced, and the law of temperature change can be grasped according to the historical average temperature reaching about 10 degrees Celsius, and sowing should be carried out in warm and sunny weather. In terms of seedling raising technology, the germination method should be improved. The germination pile should not be too large, generally 50-150 catties, so that the germination is uniform and the length is appropriate. The germination temperature should be high first (35 degrees Celsius) and then low (20 degrees Celsius), so that the rice buds are thick and strong. Seeds must also be dried before sowing, which can strengthen cold resistance. Windbreaks should be erected around the seedling field to keep warm. The land should be finely prepared and flattened, and the field surface should be moderately soft and hard, so that half of the grain can enter the soil when sowing. Tongcheng County in Anhui Province has a habit of burning baozi (i.e. fumigating the soil) in the seedling field, which can loosen the field soil, make it easy to refine and level, and the soil temperature can also be increased, and the seedlings grow faster. These experiences can be adopted.

    如何防止烂秧？
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    目前，大江南北已是紧张地抚育稻秧的时候，水稻壮秧全苗，是保证获得更大丰收的第一个关口。我国农民素来重视早播，农谚有“一早百早”的说法。早播可以早栽早熟，后作亦可随着提前；也就是一熟早，熟熟都早。经验证明，五岭以南，早稻早熟可以避雨害和螟害；长江流域双季连作晚稻及北方单季稻早熟可以避免后期冻害。特别是大跃进以来，由于推行密植，需工较多，为调节插秧劳力，各地都在抢早分期分批播种。
    今年早稻秧田播种期，一般都比去年提早十天到十五天，比以往提早一个月左右。如五岭以南在大寒期间即普遍开始下种，长江流域在3月上旬即趁暖落谷，北方单季稻区亦有提早在3月下旬和4月上、中旬播种的。早播固然有利增产，但在这一期间，气温变化剧烈，寒暖极不稳定，极易引起严重的死苗烂秧现象，必须加强抚育。
    水稻烂秧与催芽、整地及管理技术有密切关系。特别是播种早，温度剧变的期间长，如管理不当，烂秧会更加严重。最近长江流域各省可能经受北方寒冷空气侵袭，需要大力加强护秧工作。广东、福建、四川、浙江等省在护秧工作中很重视气候预报工作，并且在秧田管理上采取定人、定量、定质、定田块、定期评比方法，收到了好的效果。防止死苗烂秧的具体办法有下列几点：
    第一，防止死苗的措施。湿润秧田的秧苗在抽出二至三片真叶时，必须及时灌水护秧，这对制止低温、冷风侵袭是一个有效的办法。灌水可以使秧田增加水气，减少辐射热的损失，同时水的比热大，降温慢，可以保持土温不致迅速下降；灌水还有减少叶面蒸发，降低土壤盐分的作用。1958年，天津及浙江宁波等地当苗高一寸至一寸半时，灌水上秧板的苗生长良好。在一般气温下，灌水要浅，只当温度过低时才加深。温度回升后，要逐渐放水，以利光合作用的进行，如遇降霜或结冰，应在日出前灌水洗霜。
    有些地区采用油纸复盖或冷床育秧。具体作法是，在出苗后床内温度超过摄氏三十五度时，在避风方向略微启开复盖物，通气降温，以锻炼秧苗对外界低温的抵抗力；在出现二至三片真叶时，必须灌水护秧。冷床育秧可以在低温时继续加盖，油纸育秧可用水调节床温。
    第二、防止烂芽、漂秧的措施。水秧田在播后萌发阶段遭受低温寒流而发生烂芽、漂秧情况时，应当尽早排水，加盖谷壳灰、山草灰、蕨草灰、炉灰、砂、马粪或牛粪碎末拌土或切断的绿肥，再加铺油纸、草帘、茅帘等，以改变水秧田为湿润秧田或保湿秧田的形式，为受寒种芽创造通气、温暖的生长发育条件，以促进根、芽的萌发。在受绵腐病、青苔、锈水等侵害而烂芽时，可采用日排夜灌，结合晒田喷撒倍量式波尔多液（水一百斤、硫酸铜半斤、生石灰一斤）每亩二百斤，或西力生石灰粉（一比十）每亩三至四斤，以消灭绵腐病；青苔可把硫酸铜用布袋挂在水口，每亩每次二至三两，用药三至四次，即可完全消灭；如有锈水，要勤换清水。对稻摇蚊、泥苞虫可撒6％六六六混砂或土（一比一百），每亩用六六六粉四至五两，施用时田面保持二至三分的浅水层，撒后十二至二十四小时内要进行换水。
    在寒温不断起伏的期间，必须提高水温，才能起到护秧作用。各地经验，在秧田附近设立晒水池或晒水田是比较习用的简易办法。四川宜宾专区还采用了打热水针的办法（即用楠竹筒盛热水放入秧田），以提高水温，江安县采取了这种办法，由一畈烂秧20％降低到5％左右。在低温持续不改的情况下，还可采用田间熏烟法，提高秧田的温度。
    在做好护秧工作的同时，还要努力改善秧苗的营养条件，以促进根粗苗壮，栽植后返青快，生育提前，密植后可以苗苗成穗，并能达到穗大粒重的目的。出苗后除了浅水勤换外，还要及时追施速效性的肥料，在秧苗恢复期间施用草木灰、坑洞灰等肥料有很好作用，也有消灭青苔、地皮等低等植物的后效。随着幼苗的成长，要追施硫酸錏或稀薄人粪尿，硫酸錏每次每亩十至二十斤，人粪尿每次每亩三至五担，施肥次数，应根据幼苗生育情况而定，一般为三至四次。施肥技术上要掌握少追勤施，先淡后浓的原则，可以使秧苗不猛长，保持健壮状况。
    北方季节较晚的地区，目前有的正在播种，有的即将播种，应当吸取经验，除密切注意上述护秧工作外，应大力推行湿润秧田；有条件地区，可以采用保温秧田，如油纸育秧、冷床育秧、温床育秧等。播种期适当提早，可根据历年旬平均达到摄氏十度左右时，掌握寒温变化规律，趁暖抢晴播种。在育秧技术上要改进催芽方法，催芽堆不能过大，一般以五十至一百五十斤为度，使催芽整齐，长短适当；催芽温度要先高（摄氏三十五度）后低（摄氏二十度），则稻芽粗壮；播种还必须晾种，这样可以加强抗寒力。在秧田四周要架设防风障保温，整地方面要整得细、推得平，田面要软硬适度，落谷时可使半粒入土。安徽桐城县在秧田烧包子（即熏土）的习惯，能使田土疏松，容易整细整平，土温亦可提高，秧苗生长亦快，这些经验都可以采用。
