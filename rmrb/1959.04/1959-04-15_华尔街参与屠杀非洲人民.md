　　Wall Street Involved in Slaughtering African People
    The latest issue of the American "Worker's Weekly" published an article by Art Shields, exposing the criminal role played by U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of State Dillon in the bloody slaughter of African people.
    The article pointed out that American consuls openly support white colonialists in Central Africa in slaughtering African patriots in Nyasaland and elsewhere. In North Africa, French colonial troops also use American-made aircraft to bomb peaceful Algerian villages.
    The article then cites the current Acting Deputy Undersecretary of State Dillon as an example to illustrate the greedy ambitions of American monopoly groups towards Africa. It said that Dillon's company has obtained oil exploration concessions in millions of acres of land in Africa. These companies have huge investments in African mining. Dillon Read & Co., owned by his family, is the investment bank of the Union of South Africa. At the same time, Dillon Read & Co. also extracts profits from the labor of Morocco and Algeria through its investment in Newmont Mining Corporation.
    The article wrote that Dillon's oil company has a one-third interest in 35 million acres of leased land in Libya; a one-third interest in 23 million acres of leased land in British Somaliland on the east coast of Africa; and a one-sixth interest in 61 million acres in Somalia (formerly Italian Somaliland) in the northeast.
    The article pointed out that Dillon's oil company, together with the Morgan and Rockefeller consortia, jointly divides up Africa's oil resources, and its partners are Continental Oil Company (belonging to the Morgan consortium) and Ohio Oil Company (a company of Rockefeller). Currently, Dillon represents these bankers and oil tycoons in the State Department.
    The article pointed out that Dillon has particularly close ties with the reactionary government of South Africa. Dillon's bank once issued bonds on the American Stock Exchange for South Africa's Prime Minister Verwoerd, funding the reactionary South African government's colonial rule over the African people.
    The article also pointed out that Dillon Read & Co. has been one of the most aggressively acquisitive enterprises in international banking since World War I. In the 1920s and 1930s, it issued hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds for Latin American dictators. Dillon's bank also funded major German steel, electricity, and coal mining companies that supported Hitler.
    The article concludes: "Americans will hang their heads in shame when they hear people like Dillon and Dulles talk about the 'free world'."

### 华尔街参与屠杀非洲人民

　　华尔街参与屠杀非洲人民
    最近一期的美国“工人周报”刊登了阿尔特·薛尔兹的一篇文章，揭露美国代理副国务卿狄龙在屠杀非洲人民的流血事件中所起的罪恶作用。
    文章指出，美国的领事们公然支持在中非的白种殖民主义者去屠杀尼亚萨兰及其他地方的非洲爱国者。在北非，法国殖民军队也用美制飞机去轰炸阿尔及利亚的和平村庄。
    这篇文章接着举出现任代理副国务卿的狄龙为例，来说明美国垄断集团对非洲所抱的贪婪野心。它说，狄龙的公司在非洲数百万英亩的地区内取得了开采石油的特许权。这些公司在非洲矿业中有巨大的投资。属于他的家族所有的狄龙—里德公司，是南非联邦的投资银行。同时狄龙—里德公司还通过对纽蒙特采矿公司的投资而从摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚的劳工中榨取利润。
    文章写道，狄龙的石油公司在利比亚三千五百万英亩的租借地里有三分之一的利益；在非洲东海岸英属索马里兰二千三百万英亩的租借地里也有三分之一的利益；在东北部的索马里亚（前意属索马里兰）的六千一百万英亩中，有六分之一的利益。
    文章指出，狄龙的石油公司同摩根财团和洛克菲勒财团共同瓜分非洲的石油富源，它的伙伴是大陆石油公司（属摩根财团）和俄亥俄石油公司（洛克菲勒的一家公司）。目前狄龙在国务院里正是代表着这些银行家和石油大王。
    文章指出，狄龙同南非反动政府的关系特别密切。狄龙的银行曾经在美国证券交易所里替南非的维沃尔德总理发行过债券，资助南非反动政府对非洲人民实行殖民统治。
    文章还指出，狄龙—里德公司自从第一次世界大战以来一直是国际银行界最富有侵略性的企业之一。它在二十世纪二十年代和三十年代曾经替拉丁美洲的独裁者发行过好几亿美元的债券。狄龙的银行还资助过支持希特勒的德国大钢铁、电力和煤矿公司。
    文章最后说：“当美国人听到像狄龙和杜勒斯之流谈论‘自由世界’的时候，会感到羞耻而低下头来。”
