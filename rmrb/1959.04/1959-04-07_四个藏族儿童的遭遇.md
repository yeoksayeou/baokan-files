The armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique in collusion with imperialism has brought endless disasters to the people of Lhasa. The following description of the tragic fact that this group of traitors destroyed Tibetan families and turned four young Tibetan children into orphans is just one of their countless crimes.

In the eastern district of Lhasa, there is a tall building, the residence of the traitor Phala Thubten Wodhen. Next to the building, in a dark room adjacent to the cattle and horse pens, the servant Nyima Gyalpo and his wife Tsering Dolkar, along with their four young children, lived a life of enslaved suffering. Nyima Gyalpo was forced to work as a servant in this traitor's house at the age of twelve, and has been there for twenty-two years.

On March 10th, the day the traitorous group publicly launched the armed rebellion, Nyima Gyalpo's wife, Tsering Dolkar, was carrying a heavy iron box for the Phala family. She was physically exhausted, fell from the stairs, injured her waist, and broke a bone in her hand. At this time, the rebel faction had forbidden Lhasa citizens from going to Lhasa People's Hospital for treatment. Tsering Dolkar did not receive timely treatment, lost too much blood from her wounds, and her condition worsened day by day. On the night of March 17th, just as Tsering Dolkar was lying on her mat groaning in pain and her four young children were crying for food, the traitor Phala Thubten Wodhen, who was participating in the abduction of the Dalai Lama from Lhasa, inhumanely forced Nyima Gyalpo to leave in order to be his servant and driver on the journey, leaving Tsering Dolkar without anyone to care for her.

After the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, Tsering Dolkar immediately received treatment at the People's Hospital, but the delay after the serious injury was too long, and she eventually died. At the time of her death, she repeatedly called her husband's name, struggling to say in a weak voice: "Nyima Gyalpo, where are you? I'm dying, what will happen to the four children?..." The neighbors beside her bed were saddened by her tragic experience and shed tears.

The four orphans who lost their parents were only thirteen years old at the oldest and one year and one month old at the youngest. After hearing about this situation, the Lhasa Military Control Commission's work team immediately sent staff to take care of them, gave the four orphans thirty catties of zanba, five catties of ghee, and three bricks of tea, and entrusted them to Tsering Dolkar's aunt to raise. The Military Control Commission work team also proposed that it would continue to provide relief to these four orphans in the future.

On April 2nd, the reporter went to visit these four orphans. I saw thirteen-year-old Tsering Yangzhu holding her one-year-and-one-month-old little sister, quietly sunbathing. Tsering Dolkar's aunt heard the sound and walked out of the room. She was a sixty-year-old woman, holding the third child, a four-year-old orphan, who was snoring soundly. The old woman said that with the care of the People's Liberation Army, the four orphans were living very well. When it came to the orphans' life stories, the old woman's eyes filled with tears, both indignant and sad. She pointed to the building where Phala Thubten Wodhen had lived before he fled and said, "If those black-hearted guys were still sitting high in the building, these four orphans would surely die. Chairman Mao is truly the reborn parent of the poor Tibetan people." At this time, the people who had gathered around also accused the rebel bandits of their crimes, unanimously folded their palms, bowed and thanked the People's Liberation Army for saving these four orphans.

    四个藏族儿童的遭遇
    新华社记者　宗子度
    西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义发动的武装叛乱，给拉萨市人民带来了无穷的灾难。下面记述的这件叛国集团破坏西藏人民家庭，使四个幼小的藏族儿童成了孤儿的惨痛事实，就是他们无数罪行中的一个。
    在拉萨市城东区有一幢高大的楼房，是叛国分子帕拉·土登为登的住宅。在楼房旁边与牛马棚为邻的一间阴暗的小屋里，佣人尼玛杰波夫妻和四个幼小的儿女，在那里过着被奴役的痛苦生活。尼玛杰波十二岁就被迫到这个叛国分子的家里当佣人，到现在已整整二十二个年头了。
    3月10日，就是叛国集团公开发动武装叛乱的那一天，尼玛杰波的妻子茨仁卓噶给帕拉家背运一只很重的铁箱，体力不支，从楼梯上摔下来，跌伤了腰，折断了手骨。这时，叛乱分子已经不准拉萨市民到拉萨人民医院去治病。茨仁卓噶得不到及时治疗，伤口流血过多，伤势日益严重。3月17日夜间，正当茨仁卓噶躺在垫子上痛苦呻吟，四个幼小的儿女嗷嗷待哺的时候，叛国分子帕拉·土登为登正在参与将达赖喇嘛劫出拉萨，竟绝灭人性地将尼玛杰波强迫拉走，供他途中奴役驱使，使茨仁卓噶无人照顾。
    拉萨叛乱平息后，茨仁卓噶马上得到人民医院的治疗，但是重伤后拖延过久，终于不治身死。她临终的时候，还再三呼唤丈夫的名字，用微弱的声音挣扎着说：“尼玛杰波，你在哪里？我快死了，四个孩子怎么办？……”在她病床旁边的邻人们，都为她的悲惨遭遇，伤心地流眼泪。
    失去了爹娘的四个孤儿，大的才十三岁，小的只有一岁零一个月。拉萨市军管会工作队听说这个情况后，马上派工作人员去负责照料，给四个孤儿发了三十斤糌粑、五斤酥油和三块茶叶，并将他们交给茨仁卓噶的姨母托养。军管会工作队还提出，今后将继续救济这四个孤儿。
    4月2日，记者去探望这四个孤儿。看见十三岁的茨仁央珠抱着她的一岁零一个月的小妹妹，在安静地晒太阳。茨仁卓噶的姨母闻声从房里走出来，她是一位六十岁的老人，怀里抱着正在鼾睡的、排行第三的四岁孤儿。老人说，在人民解放军的关怀下，四个孤儿都生活得很好。一谈到孤儿的身世，老人就热泪盈眶，又是愤慨，又是伤心。她指着帕拉·土登为登逃跑前住过的楼房说：“如果那些黑透良心的家伙还高高坐在楼上的话，这四个孤儿准死无疑，毛主席真是西藏穷苦人民重生的父母。”这时，围拢来的人们也纷纷控诉叛匪的罪行，一致合掌顶礼，感谢人民解放军救活了这四个孤儿。
