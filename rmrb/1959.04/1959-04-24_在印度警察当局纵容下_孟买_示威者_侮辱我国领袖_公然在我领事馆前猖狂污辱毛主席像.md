Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd, Bombay News: On the afternoon of April 20th, more than eighty members of the Indian Praja Socialist Party held a "demonstration" at the Chinese Consulate in Bombay, India, openly insulting the image of our national leader Chairman Mao, and shouting slogans such as "Chinese troops withdraw from Tibet."

This group of Praja Socialist Party members even pasted the image of Chairman Mao on the consulate wall and threw tomatoes at it. The Indian police not only did not interfere, but also pulled back the surrounding onlookers to allow reporters to take pictures. After the "demonstrators" left, they again allowed people to take pictures, and then the police officer tore down and took away the image of Chairman Mao.

While causing disturbances in front of the consulate, two people came out to speak, slandering China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as "imperialism," clamoring that Premier Zhou Enlai's statement that the Dalai Lama was abducted was a lie, and slandering China for undermining the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, etc.

After the speeches, the "demonstrators" threw a bundle of "protest letters" into the courtyard of our consulate and tied the protest letters with black ribbons and threw them into the courtyard attached to two pigeons. This protest letter "protested against China's military intervention in Tibet" and stated that "the Chinese have no right to maintain sovereignty over Tibet by force."

As early as March 29th, the Praja Socialist Party organized a so-called "Tibet Day" activity in Bombay. On that day, the party held a "mass meeting," and afterwards one hundred and fifty people held a "demonstration." These "demonstrators" shouted slogans slandering China: "Oppose Chinese dictatorship in Tibet," "Oppose Chinese massacres in Tibet," "India should not remain silent on the Tibet issue," etc. At the meeting, someone proposed to "demonstrate" at the Chinese Consulate in Bombay, but it was not passed.

On the morning of April 8th, the Revolutionary Workers Party and the Revolutionary Socialist Party of Bombay gathered more than forty people to "demonstrate" in front of our consulate, shouting slogans attacking and slandering China such as "Down with Stalinists," "Long live free Tibet," "Give Tibet self-determination," and "Get out of Tibet."

    在印度警察当局纵容下
    孟买“示威者”侮辱我国领袖
    公然在我领事馆前猖狂污辱毛主席像
    新华社23日讯　孟买消息：4月20日下午印度人民社会党八十余人到中国驻印度孟买领事馆举行“示威”，公然侮辱我国领袖毛主席像，并呼喊“中国军队退出西藏”等口号。
    这群人民社会党人竟把毛主席像贴在领事馆墙上，并向像上乱掷西红柿。而印度警察在旁不仅未予干涉，还将周围旁观的人群拉开，让记者拍照。“示威者”离去后，又再次让人拍照，然后，警官才将毛主席像撕下取走。
    在领事馆门前进行骚扰的时候，有两个人出来讲话，污蔑中国平息西藏叛乱是“帝国主义”，叫嚣周恩来总理说达赖喇嘛被劫持是谎话，污蔑中国破坏了和平共处五项原则等。
    讲话以后，“示威者”将一束“抗议书”掷进我领事馆院内，并将抗议书系上黑条挂在二只鸽子上掷进院内。这份抗议书“抗议中国在西藏的军事干涉”，并且说“中国人没有权力用武力来保持对西藏的宗主权。”
    早在3月29日，人民社会党就曾在孟买组织了所谓“西藏日”的活动。当天，这个党召开了一次“群众大会”，会后有一百五十人举行“示威”。这些“示威者”呼喊着诬蔑中国的口号：“反对中国在西藏的独裁”，“反对中国在西藏的屠杀”，“印度不应对西藏问题沉默”等等。在大会上有人提议要到中国驻孟买领事馆“示威”，但是没有获得通过。
    4月8日上午，孟买的革命工人党、革命社会党纠集了四十多人到我领事馆前“示威”，呼喊“打倒斯大林分子”、“自由西藏万岁”、“给西藏自决权”、“滚出西藏”等攻击和诬蔑中国的口号。
