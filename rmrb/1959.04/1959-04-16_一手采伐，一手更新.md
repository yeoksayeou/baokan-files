　　Cutting on One Hand, Renewal on the Other

Forest renewal is an important part of national forestry construction and a primary measure for consolidating and developing existing forest bases. "Making the speed of renewal exceed the speed of felling" and "Planting two or three trees for every one felled" is a fundamental principle in forestry work.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, forestry workers and the broad masses of people across the country have done a great deal of work to achieve "renewal exceeding felling." In particular, the renewal area in 1958 was greater than the total renewal area in all previous years since liberation. The quality of renewal work has also improved, with the survival rate of artificially planted seedlings generally above 80%. This has fundamentally reversed the situation of renewal lagging behind felling, boosted confidence in renewal exceeding felling, and laid a good foundation for the continued great leap forward in forest renewal work in the future.

The central task of forest renewal work in 1959 is to continue our efforts, advance victoriously, ensure that the speed of renewal catches up with and exceeds felling, and actively improve the quality of renewal work. We must strive to achieve renewal wherever felling takes place, renewal alongside felling, and actively plant trees on old felled areas, burned areas, sparse forest land, and forest gaps.

Can this year's renewal work tasks be completed satisfactorily? The answer is yes. This year has many favorable conditions for completing the task: the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels and the importance attached to renewal work by forestry workers; the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses; the rich experience of last year's Great Leap Forward; and a greater material and technical foundation than in the past. This year, most places started earlier than usual, and preparatory work has been relatively thorough. The only question is how to fully develop these favorable factors. To develop renewal work in a faster, better, and more economical way, forestry departments at all levels and other relevant units should first strengthen their leadership over renewal work, closely integrate increased timber production with long-term management, implement simultaneous felling and renewal, and, while focusing on timber production, firmly grasp forest renewal work in terms of ideology and organizational measures. Treating felling as an urgent task while considering renewal as a task that can be delayed is a manifestation of short-sightedness and a lack of communist style. We must think from the perspective of the overall interest, for the long-term interests and grand goals of the country and the people; we must make every effort to expand the forest area and ensure the sustainable use of forest resources.

To do a good job in renewal work, we must vigorously carry out mass movements. Some units where renewal caught up with or exceeded felling last year, such as the Dailing Forestry Experimental Bureau, which achieved "cutting one, creating two," and the Dongjingcheng, Meixi, and Yituli River Forestry Bureaus, which achieved a double leap forward in felling and renewal, their most important experience was to put politics in command and vigorously carry out mass movements. In the season suitable for forest renewal, they strengthened ideological education, mobilized all possible forces, and went all out to launch a mass movement of renewal catching up with and surpassing felling; they launched red flag competitions between bureaus, between farms, and between teams, comparing drive, speed, and quality. This year, we should continue to carry out mass movements. At the same time, we must better organize labor and do a good job in preparing seedlings, tools, and other items, working hard, practically, and skillfully. While vigorously carrying out mass movements, all forest farms are required to establish afforestation professional teams to be responsible for the tending and protection work after planting trees.

In renewal work, we must adhere to the principle of "artificial renewal as the main method, supplemented by artificial promotion of natural renewal and simple natural renewal." This is an important experience that our forestry workers have explored over the years, and it is the correct way to achieve renewal work in a faster, better, and more economical way. In artificial renewal, we must pay great attention to quality. In artificially renewed forest land, we must comprehensively implement the six basic measures of "suitable trees for suitable land, meticulous land preparation, fine seeds and strong seedlings, appropriate close planting, tending and protection, and tool reform." In forest land with artificially promoted natural renewal, management should also be strengthened in this spirit. In short, we must strive to plant more, live well, and renew one area, and form a forest in one area.

Vigorously grasping seed collection and seedling cultivation and tool reform are fundamental issues in renewal work. To ensure the quality of renewal, we must first have good seedlings. Therefore, we must continue to carry out the movement of everyone collecting seeds and every farm cultivating seedlings. Seed collection should pay attention to the demarcation and cultivation of seed forests; seedling cultivation should implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and vigorously promote rapid growth and high yield.

Spring is the most favorable season for forest renewal, and 60% to 70% of the task should be completed in the spring. At present, large-scale renewal work has already begun. We should quickly mobilize the masses and march into the felled areas and forest gaps to strive for the speed of forest renewal to exceed the speed of felling!

### 一手采伐，一手更新

　　一手采伐，一手更新
    森林更新，是国家林业建设的重要组成部分，是巩固和发展现有森林基地的首要措施。“使更新的速度超过采伐”，“伐一棵种两棵三棵”，是林业工作中的一条根本性的方针。
    几年来，全国各林区职工和广大群众，在党的领导下，为实现“更新超过采伐”，做了许多工作。特别是1958年，更新面积比解放以来历年更新面积的总和还要多。更新工作质量也有所提高，人工植苗成活率一般在80％以上。这就基本扭转了更新落后于采伐的局面，鼓舞了更新超过采伐的信心，为今后森林更新工作的继续大跃进打下了良好基础。
    1959年森林更新工作的中心任务是继续努力，乘胜前进，确保更新的速度赶上和超过采伐，并且积极提高更新工作的质量。要争取做到哪里采伐、哪里更新，随采伐、随更新，并积极地在旧的采伐迹地、火烧迹地、稀疏林地和林中空地种植林木。
    能不能完满地完成今年的更新工作任务呢？答复是肯定的。今年有完成任务的许多有利条件：有各级党委的坚强领导和林业职工对更新工作的重视；有广大群众的冲天干劲；有去年大跃进的丰富经验；有比过去更多的物质技术基础；今年各地一般动手较早，准备工作做的比较充分。问题只在于如何充分地发扬这些有利因素。要多快好省地发展更新工作，各级林业部门和其它有关单位，首先应该加强对更新工作的领导，把增产林木和长期经营密切结合起来，实行采伐和更新同时并举，在抓木材生产工作的同时，从思想上、组织措施上把森林更新工作紧紧地抓起来。只把采伐当成紧要任务，而把更新当成可以缓行的任务，那是目光短浅、缺乏共产主义风格的一种表现。我们必须从整体利益着想，为国家和人民的长远利益和远大目标着想；必须千方百计扩大森林面积，并保证森林资源的永续利用。
    做好更新工作，必须大搞群众运动。去年更新赶上或超过采伐的一些单位，如做到“砍一造二”的带岭林业实验局，实现采伐更新双跃进的东京城、美溪和伊图里河等林业局，他们的最重要的经验就是政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。他们在适宜森林更新的季节，加强思想教育工作，动员一切可能动员的力量，全力以赴，开展了群众性的更新赶采伐超采伐的运动；在局与局、场与场、队与队之间，开展了比干劲、比速度、比质量的红旗竞赛。今年，应该继续开展群众运动。同时，要更好地组织劳动力，并且做好种苗、工具等项准备工作，苦干实干巧干。在大搞群众运动的同时，要求各林场普遍建立营林专业队，负责进行种植林木以后的抚育保护工作。
    在更新工作中，要坚持“人工更新为主，人工促进天然更新和单纯天然更新为辅”的方针。这是我国林业工作者几年来摸索出来的一条重要经验，是更新工作多快好省的正确途径。在人工更新中，要十分讲究质量。人工更新的林地，要全面贯彻执行“适地适树，细致整地，良种壮苗，适当密植，抚育保护，改革工具”六项基本措施。人工促进天然更新的林地，也应本着这个精神加强经营管理。总之，要力求做到种的多，活得好，更新一片，成林一片。
    大抓采种育苗和工具改革工作，在更新工作中是带有根本性的问题。要保证更新的质量，首先要有好的种苗。因此，要继续开展人人采种、场场育苗运动。采种要注意母树林的划定和培育；育苗要贯彻农业八字宪法，大搞速生丰产。
    春季是森林更新的最有利季节，60％—70％的任务要在春季来完成。目前，大规模的更新工作已经开始了。应该迅速发动群众，向采伐迹地和林中空地进军，为森林更新的速度超过采伐而奋斗！
