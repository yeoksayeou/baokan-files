　　Implementation and Thoroughness
　　Shi Liuming
    In leadership work, whether or not implementation is achieved depends greatly on whether the work is carried through to the very end. If it reaches the end, the implementation is more likely to be assured. If it remains suspended in mid-air, it may end up being in vain.
    Economic work is a complex undertaking, and it requires even greater attention to detail, implementing each task and carrying through on every matter.
    What is the actual production capacity of grassroots units? What is the actual understanding of production tasks among grassroots organizations and production personnel? What is the actual confidence of grassroots organizations in completing planned targets and the arrangements for production progress? Those who float on the surface, whose work does not reach the very end, and who are clueless, cannot answer these questions.
    What does it mean to carry something through to the very end? The "end" refers to the workers in grassroots production organizations. Carrying through to the end in leadership work means directly presenting the Party's guidelines and tasks to the broad masses of the people, explaining to them the reasons for implementing these guidelines and completing these tasks; mobilizing the masses to engage in extensive airing of views, big contending, and big debates, and also humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, fully absorbing their wisdom and experience, so that the Party's intentions are combined with the wisdom of the masses, and the Party's guidelines and slogans become the conscious actions of the masses.
    Adopting the approach of carrying through to the very end in production organization is of great benefit to ensuring key priorities because after the Party's guidelines and tasks, especially the tasks of key products, are directly presented to the masses and discussed by them, the planned targets can be both advanced and practical. At the same time, the raw materials needed for key national products can be directly allocated to grassroots production departments by the responsible departments, ensuring dedicated materials for dedicated use, without layers of transmittal that delay time, misappropriation midway, and dispersed efforts. Furthermore, the responsible departments can directly control the production progress, and grassroots enterprises can directly assign tasks to each machine tool, ensuring that products are completed on time, in quantity, with quality, and in complete sets to fulfill the production tasks.
    Of course, advocating carrying through to the very end does not mean that the higher authorities should take over everything; on the contrary, we emphasize carrying through to the very end in order to give greater play to the initiative of grassroots enterprises, not to take over everything. Facts have proven that under centralized leadership, whenever the method of carrying through to the very end is used to directly convey the Party's guidelines and tasks to enterprises, the production measures in these units are formulated more specifically, and cadres and the masses feel that they have a clear understanding and clear goals. Production is then done well. The Tianjin Second Electric Motor Factory is an example of this.
    Carrying through to the very end is an important method of combining leadership with the masses, and it is an important method of implementing the mass line. To understand the situation and decide on policies, the leadership should not only rely on the information from the middle levels as the basis; it needs to carry through to the very end, to find those grassroots cadres and activists in production to get a clear picture. Grassroots cadres and activists in grassroots production units often have a grasp of the real situation and correct opinions. If this aspect is neglected, and contact with these people is abandoned, then it cannot be considered as carrying through to the very end.
    Industrial production and construction are the practical actions of millions of people. How to incorporate the practical actions of millions of people into the plan? How to make millions of people act vigorously and practically according to a policy guideline? In ideological education, we must carry through to the very end! In organizational leadership, we must also carry through to the very end!

### 落实和到底

　　落实和到底
　　石六鸣
    做领导工作，落实不落实，很重要的一条，要看工作是不是一竿子到底。到了底，落实就比较有把握，到不了底，悬在半空，就可能落空。
    经济工作是一项复杂的工作，更加需要讲究深入细致，件件落实，事事到底。
    基层单位的生产能力到底怎么样？基层组织和基层生产人员对生产任务的认识到底怎么样？基层组织对完成计划指标的信心和生产进度的安排到底又怎么样？飘浮在上面，工作没有一竿子到底，心中无数的人，是无法回答这些问题的。
    什么是一竿子到底？“底”就是基层生产组织的职工。领导工作上的一竿子到底，就是把党的方针、任务直接同千百万群众见面，向群众讲清楚执行这个方针，完成这个任务的道理；发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，并且虚心地听取群众的意见，充分地吸取群众的智慧和经验，使党的意图同群众智慧结合在一起，使党的方针、口号成为群众自觉的行动。
    在生产组织上采取一竿子到底的作法对于保证重点有莫大的好处，因为国家的方针任务特别是重点产品的任务直接和群众见面以后，经过群众讨论，确定计划指标，这个计划指标就可能做到既先进而又切实可行。同时，国家重点产品所需要的原料可以由主管部门直接调拨给基层生产部门，专材专用；不致于层层转递，耽误时间，中途挪用，分散力量。再有，主管部门还可以直接掌握生产进度，基层企业单位可以直接把任务分派到每个车床，保证产品按期按量按质按套地完成生产任务。
    当然，提倡一竿子到底，并不是意味着由上面来包办代替，相反，我们强调一竿子到底，目的在于发挥基层企业单位更大的积极性，而不是包办代替。事实证明在集中领导下，凡是用一竿子到底的办法，把国家的方针任务直接下达到企业单位，那末，这种单位的生产措施也就订得比较具体，干部和群众感到心中落实，目标明确。生产就搞得好。天津第二电机厂就是一个例子。
    一竿子到底，是领导和群众相结合的重要方法，是贯彻执行群众路线的重要方法。领导方面要了解情况，决定政策，不能仅仅依靠那些来自中层的情况做依据，需要一竿子到底，要找那些基层干部，生产中的积极分子来摸底，基层干部和基层生产单位的积极分子手里常常掌握着真实的情况和正确的意见，如果忽视了这个方面，放弃了同这些人的接触，也就不能算是一竿子到底了。
    工业的生产和建设，是千百万人的实际行动，怎样把千百万人的实际行动纳入到计划以内，怎样使千百万人按照一个政策方针轰轰烈烈、踏踏实实行动起来。在思想教育上要一竿子到底！在组织领导上也要一竿子到底。
