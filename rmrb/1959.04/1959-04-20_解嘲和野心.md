Notes

    Self-deprecation and Ambition
    In a statement released by the West German Press Office on the 15th, West German Chancellor Adenauer said that his decisive motivation for accepting the presidential candidacy was: "To guarantee the continuation of the current foreign and domestic policies for the next few years."

    Adenauer's solemn statement is rather surprising. Because, as everyone can see, resigning from the powerful position of prime minister to become a ceremonial president is undoubtedly a promotion in name only, with real power slipping away. Western news agencies have even described this as Adenauer being "kicked upstairs." International public opinion has further pointed out that this is a reflection of the bankruptcy of Adenauer's stubborn and rigid policy of strength. Even Adenauer himself was filled with grief and indignation, to the point of having to "contemplate for two hours," and only after realizing that the overall situation was irreversible did he have to reluctantly accept this decision. Now, Adenauer's self-deprecation is also a futile attempt to conceal the truth. According to him, not being prime minister can better guarantee the continuation of current policies. It seems that "not holding the position" can actually "better plan its affairs."

    However, Adenauer's defense does indeed reflect his ambition to make a final struggle. According to reports, Adenauer is plotting to amend the West German constitution in an attempt to expand the powers of the president and maintain his control over West German domestic and foreign policies. The West German "Frankfurter Rundschau" pointed out: "Anyone who knows Adenauer knows that no matter what his position, he will not give up control of policy until his last breath." The reason why Adenauer still has such "firm confidence" after being rebuffed is because the arrogance of militarism means he has not yet reached "his last breath."

    解嘲和野心
    西德总理阿登纳15日在由西德新闻处发表的一篇声明中说，他接受总统候选人的决定性动机是：“在今后若干年内保证现行外交和国内政策的继续。”
    阿登纳这篇郑重其事的声明，不免令人吃惊。因为，谁都看得见，辞去掌握实权的总理职位而去当执行仪式的总统，无疑是明升暗降，大权旁落。西方通讯社甚至把这形容为阿登纳已经“被踢上楼去”。各国舆论更指出，这是阿登纳顽固僵硬的实力政策遭到破产的反映。就是阿登纳自己又何尝不是悲愤交集，以致要“沉思两小时”，深知大势已去之后，才不得不被迫接受这个决定。现在，阿登纳的解嘲也是欲盖弥彰。照他说来，他不当总理倒是更能保证现行政策的继续。似乎“不在其位”反而能“更谋其政”了。
    但是，阿登纳的辩白也的确反映了他力图作最后挣扎的野心。据报道，阿登纳正在阴谋修改西德宪法，企图扩大总统职权，以保持他对西德内外政策的控制。西德“法兰克福评论报”便指出过：“凡是了解阿登纳的人都知道，不管他的地位怎样，他都不会放弃对政策的控制，直到最后一口气为止”。阿登纳在碰壁之后所以还有那末“坚定的信心”，是因为军国主义的气焰使他还没有“到最后一口气”的时候。
