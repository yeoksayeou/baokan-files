Spring Breeze Awakens Peach Blossom Flood
　　Ten Thousand Miles of Rivers Busily Transporting

The annual peach blossom flood season has arrived again. On the crisscrossing rivers of the motherland, navigation workers in various regions are seizing the favorable opportunity of increased water volume during the peach flood to step up the transportation of various materials.

This year's national water transport task is much larger than last year. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the early start of many basic construction projects, the main inland waterways, which usually do not become active until after May, have been particularly busy since March this year.

On the Yangtze River, which has the largest volume of transportation, fleets pushed by tugboats and wooden boats with white sails are heading towards Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, laden with ore, coal, and gravel, transporting raw materials and construction materials for this steel base. In the last three quarters of last year, only more than 220,000 tons of coal and ore were transported to Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation through the Yangtze River shipping, while in the first quarter of this year, there were more than 130,000 tons.

　　Sichuan Grain Boats Shuttle Back and Forth
　　Forest Timber Flows Downstream

On the Sichuan River, grain boats shuttle back and forth during the day, and red and green navigation lights shine brightly at night. Since late March, the navigation workers on this river have been transporting large amounts of grain from Sichuan Province, which has had bumper harvests every year since liberation, to large cities and industrial bases such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Liaoning. A few days ago, the Sichuan River was hit by wind and rain, and the navigation workers braved the wind and rain to pull wooden boats one after another to the side of the steamer for loading and unloading. The amount of grain transferred out of Sichuan Province via the Sichuan River in March was equal to the total of January and February, and April will increase by about 80,000 tons compared to March.

The peach flood season is the golden season for releasing timber. The navigation workers in the timber-producing areas have adopted a combination of "herding sheep" and "releasing rafts" in the releasing, and have promoted many advanced experiences such as bamboo river ropes and submerged raft bundling to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure safety. On the Ou River, which flows through the "forest sea" of the mountainous area of southern Zhejiang, the workers have strengthened the management of floating timber, formulated a set of operating procedures, and used side-by-side or single-end forms for releasing according to the width, depth, and water level of the river, which greatly accelerated the release speed.

　　Xiaoqing River Red Flag Fluttering
　　Songhua River Whistle Sounding

On the 240-kilometer-long Xiaoqing River in Shandong, more than 2,000 sailors and stevedores launched a red flag competition to ensure that fertilizers and seeds needed for spring planting are not backlogged. In the past, a tugboat could only tow two barges, but now it has increased to a dozen or even dozens. The employees on the wooden sailing boats, in order to save time, put forward the slogan of "no stopping when passing by home, no stopping when pulling ropes against the wind, and no stopping day and night when going downstream." Some traveled ninety miles a day against the wind, exceeding the general speed of wooden boats by thirty or forty miles a day. In the first quarter, 34,000 tons of fertilizers, seeds, coal, etc. transferred out of Jinan have been supplied to people's communes in Guangrao, Zouping and other places through this river.

On the Songhua River in Northeast China, steamships sounding their whistles have replaced the cars and sleds that were recently used for ice transport. As early as March, the Heilongjiang Shipping Administration established a transportation command and seized a series of preparations such as launching ships and organizing sources of goods. Now, large quantities of goods to be transported are piled up on many wharves along the river. Soybeans and sorghum abundant on both sides of the Songhua River, timber from the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and coal from Hegang will all be transported out by this river. With the thawing of the Yellow River, the employees of the shipping department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are also busy. At present, they are nervously repairing shipping tools in preparation for water transportation.

　　Loading More and Running Fast, Everyone Works Skillfully
　　Blasting Reefs and Splitting Rocks to Open New Roads

In order to further meet the needs of increased freight volume, navigation workers in various places have also extensively carried out technical innovation movements, tapped transportation potential, and strived to double the port capacity and increase the ship transportation capacity by half. For wooden sailing boats, which account for about 70% of the national water transport task, various places are stepping up the improvement of ship types and tools, and carrying out technical reforms such as mechanization and towing. More than 1,200 wooden sailing boats in Anhui Province have been mechanized or semi-mechanized, which not only improved transportation efficiency, but also freed the crew from heavy physical labor such as paddling, hand-supporting, and pulling ropes. After the Sanhe Shipping Management Station in Hefei changed the professional wooden sailing boats with a load of less than 15 tons to mechanized or semi-mechanized, the transportation efficiency generally increased by two to three times.

Before the arrival of the peach flood, various places combined with water conservancy construction to blast reefs, split rocks, dredge rivers, and open up many new routes. Hunan Province, which is famous for its abundant water resources, has large fleets coming and going not only on the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, Li and the vast Dongting Lake after dredging the rivers, but also for the first time wooden sailing boats and small wooden boats have appeared in many mountain streams, small rivers and farmland irrigation channels that could not be navigated in the past. The Lianjiang River, a tributary of the Beijiang River in Guangdong, has a lot of coal reserves. In the past, due to the dense reefs, many dangerous shoals, and rapid water flow, tugboats could not pass, and the coal could not be transported out. The shipping workers spent more than a month blasting 4,500 cubic meters of reefs and dredging more than 90 shoals, so that shallow-water tugboats could navigate the entire line day and night, and transport coal in time to support the steel industry. On the Wujiang River, known as a natural danger in Guizhou, the workers also used methods such as blasting and clearing channels to open up dangerous shoals that had been cut off, and opened up more than 200 kilometers of shallow-water tugboat channels.

### 春风吹醒桃花汛  万里江河运输忙

　　春风吹醒桃花汛
　　万里江河运输忙
    一年一度的桃花汛又来临了，在祖国纵横交错的江河上，各地航运职工正抓住桃汛期间水量增大的有利时机，加紧运输各种物资。
    今年全国水上运输任务比去年增长很大。随着工农业生产大跃进和许多基本建设工程提前开工，往年要到5月以后才开始活跃的主要内河航道，今年从3月份起就特别忙碌起来。
    在运量最大的长江，一队队由拖轮顶推的船队和扬着白帆的木船，满载着矿石、煤炭和砂石等争向武钢驶行，为这个钢铁基地运送原料和建筑材料。去年后三个季度，通过长江航运运给武钢的煤炭、矿石等只有二十二万多吨，今年第一季度就有十三万多吨。
    川江粮船来往如梭
    林海木材顺流而下
    在川江上，白天粮船穿梭来往，入夜红绿标灯齐放光明。3月下旬以来，这条江上的航运职工们，每天都把大量的粮食从解放后年年丰收的四川省，经川江转运到上海、天津、北京和辽宁等大城市和工业基地。前几天，川江沿线风雨交加，航运工人们冒着风雨把木船一只又一只地拉到轮船旁边进行装卸。3月份经由川江外调的粮食等于1、2月份的总和，4月份还要比3月份再增加八万吨左右。
    桃汛期间正是放运木材的黄金季节。木材产区的航运职工们在放运中采取了“赶羊”、“放排”相结合的办法，并且推广了竹筑河绠、沉水扎排等许多提高效率、降低成本、保证安全的先进经验。在流经浙南山区“林海”的瓯江，职工们加强了对流放木材的管理，制定了一套操作规程；并根据河道宽窄深浅和水位高低，用并排或单梢的形式放运，大大加快了流放速度。
    小清河红旗招展
    松花江汽笛长鸣
    在全长两百四十公里的山东小清河上，两千多名船员和装卸工人开展了红旗竞赛，保证不积压春播需用的肥料和种子。过去一只拖轮只能拖两只驳船，现在增加到十几只甚至几十只。木帆船上的员工们为了抢时间，提出“路过家门不停、逆风拉纤不停、下航昼夜不停”的口号，有的逆风日行九十里，超过一般木船日行速度三、四十里。第一季度由济南调出的三万四千吨肥料、种子、煤炭等，已经通过这条河供应了广饶、邹平等地的人民公社。
    在东北松花江上，鸣放着汽笛的轮船代替了不久前担任冰上运输的汽车、雪橇。早在3月间，黑龙江航运管理局就成立了运输指挥部，抓紧了船舶出坞、组织货源等一系列准备工作。现在，沿江许多码头上，都堆放了大批待运物资。松花江两岸盛产的大豆高粱、小兴安岭的木材、鹤岗的煤，都将由这条江运送出来。随着黄河的解冻，内蒙古自治区航运部门的职工也忙碌起来了，目前他们正在紧张地整修航运工具准备投入水上运输。
    多装快跑人人巧干
    炸礁劈石开拓新路
    为了进一步满足货运量增长的需要，各地航运职工还广泛地开展了技术革新运动，挖掘运输潜力，争取做到港口通过能力加一番，船舶运输能力提高一半。对于担负全国水上运输任务70％左右的木帆船，各地正抓紧改良船型、工具，进行机动化、拖带化等技术改革工作。安徽省已有一千二百多条木帆船实现了机械化或半机械化，不仅提高了运输效率，还使船员摆脱了划桨、手撑、拉纤等笨重体力劳动。合肥三河航运管理站把载重十五吨以下的专业木帆船改为机械化或半机械化以后，运输效率普遍提高两倍到三倍。
    在桃汛到来以前，各地结合兴修水利，炸礁劈石，疏浚河道，开辟了许多新航线。以水力资源丰富著称的湖南省，经过疏浚河道后，不仅湘、资、沅、澧和广阔的洞庭湖有大型船队来往，过去很多不能通航的山溪小河和农田灌溉渠道也第一次出现了木帆船和小木船，广东北江支流连江沿岸蕴藏煤炭很多，过去由于礁石密布、滩险多、水流急，不能通行拖轮，煤运不出来。航运职工用一个多月时间炸掉四千五百多立方公尺的礁石，疏浚浅滩九十多处，使全线昼夜都能通航浅水拖轮，把煤炭及时运出支援钢铁工业。在贵州号称天险的乌江上，职工们也用爆破清槽等方法打通了断航险滩，开辟了二百多公里的浅水拖轮航道。
