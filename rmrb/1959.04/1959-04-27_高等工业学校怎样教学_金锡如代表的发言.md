How Higher Industrial Schools Should Teach
Speech by Delegate Jin Xiru

Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of other central leaders, and I am willing to wholeheartedly implement them.

I would like to make the following remarks on some specific issues concerning the revision of teaching plans, teaching outlines, and compilation of teaching materials in the in-depth education revolution of higher industrial schools. If there are any inaccuracies, I hope the delegates will criticize and correct them.

I. Training Objectives

Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Our educational policy should enable those receiving education to develop in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness, and become workers with socialist consciousness and culture." The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country, the development of the people's commune movement, and the extremely rich experiences in socialist construction have put forward higher requirements for the development of education. Through the practice of our school implementing the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor" since last year, the victory of the rectification, anti-rightist, and major debates on educational policy, the masses' awareness has greatly increased, and Party members, Youth League members, and leftists account for the absolute majority of students. In particular, the great call of the Party Central Committee to realize the "Twelve-Year Scientific Development Plan" five years ahead of schedule and catch up with the world's advanced scientific and technological levels as soon as possible has given great encouragement and strength to the majority of teachers and students. Therefore, we believe that the training objective of engineering universities should be:

To establish a socialist and communist outlook on life, to have systematic basic theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism; to have specialized knowledge based on modern scientific and technological levels, and certain practical knowledge of production and experience in productive labor, to be able to solve major technical problems in the field of specialization and independently carry out scientific research work, and to develop comprehensively in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness.

II. Content and Form of Productive Labor

The main significance and purpose of including productive labor in the teaching plan and students participating in productive labor inside and outside the school is to obtain practical labor training, cultivate socialist and communist labor views, labor attitudes, and feelings for the working people, and acquire practical knowledge of production.

In order to better organize productive labor, schools should build factories as much as possible, and the productive labor that students participate in should be combined with their major as much as possible.

Judging from the experience and situation of learning from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reforms and our school's implementation of the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor" since last year, in the five-year (260 weeks) study process, basically arrange according to "138" (one month of vacation, three months of labor, eight months of study), it is possible to arrange one year (52 weeks) of productive labor. The 52 weeks of productive labor are distributed in the first to fourth academic years, 13 weeks each year, and carried out in a concentrated manner. Students in the fourth academic year have more opportunities to engage in graduation design and scientific research and come into contact with production practice, so no separate productive labor is arranged.

The arrangement of labor and learning adopts a combination of concentration and dispersion: during the concentrated labor period, work 36 hours per week, 6 hours per day, and at the same time arrange 18 hours of study per week (in addition to political classes, also appropriately arrange two or three continuous courses and courses combined with productive labor). During the concentrated study period, arrange 4 hours of non-industrial productive labor per week. This arrangement can maintain the continuity of labor and learning.

Thirteen weeks of labor each year, carried out in a concentrated manner, is very beneficial: it is conducive to labor training; the arrangement is simple, which is convenient for organizing teaching; it is easy to improve technical level, and manpower is relatively stable for a long time, which is beneficial to production.

III. Course Arrangement

When we revised the teaching plan and arranged courses and teaching outlines last year, the general requirements were the following three principles:

(1) The theoretical part must be strengthened, and the content of the course should be as concise as possible (less but refined).

(2) Adhere to the principle of theory linking with practice, and include productive labor and scientific research in the teaching plan (combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research).

(3) In view of the fact that in the past, in terms of the training objectives of majors, design, manufacturing, and use were basically separated, the requirements for professional knowledge must be a combination of design, manufacturing, and use, with emphasis on different majors.

After last year's practice and repeated revisions, we believe that the total teaching hours of lectures, experiments, classroom exercises, or classroom discussions for each course should be in the range of 3,500 to 3,800 hours, which should not be too small. The teaching hours and proportions of various types of courses (based on a total of 3,800 hours) are as follows:

1. Political courses: 720 hours, accounting for 19% (4 hours per week during the study period, 2 hours per week during the labor period).

2. Ten public courses: 1,830 hours, accounting for 48.2%, of which:

(1) Mathematics, physics, and general chemistry: a total of 730 hours, accounting for 19.2% (mathematics 350, physics 260, general chemistry 120).

(2) Russian: 280 hours.

(3) Drafting, mechanical principles, mechanical parts, theoretical mechanics, materials mechanics, electrical engineering, etc.: a total of 820 hours.

3. Other technical foundation courses and professional courses: 1,100 to 1,150 hours, accounting for about 29% to 30%.

4. Second foreign language: 100 to 150 hours.

5. Physical education is included in the teaching plan, but no classes are scheduled and teaching hours are not counted. One hour of physical exercise is arranged every day, but it should be carried out with requirements, organization, and planning. Physical education teachers are responsible for organizing and training student physical education cadres, and then student physical education cadres cooperate with physical education teachers to guide physical exercise.

IV. Arrangement Principles for Student Scientific Research

Our school's scientific research projects include: those entrusted by the central and provincial/municipal governments; those combined with our school's teaching and off-campus production; and those in basic theory.

Since August of last year, our school has mobilized the majority of teachers, students, and staff to participate in scientific research work. Based on the current scientific research situation and future development needs, it is necessary to continue to mobilize teachers, students, and staff to participate. However, students' participation in scientific research should be arranged differently according to the needs of scientific research tasks and students' conditions in different grades.

Lower grades (first and second years) students have less production practice training and basic knowledge, and have more courses scheduled each week. Generally, no requirements are made, but they should be organized to participate in scientific research work that they can handle according to needs and possibilities. The weekly time should generally not exceed six hours.

Middle grades (second and third years) students have more basic knowledge than lower grades students after some production labor training, and more scientific research should be arranged than lower grades students. The amount should not be too large, and can be determined according to the learning situation and the needs of scientific research tasks.

Upper grades (fourth and fifth years) students have considerable professional knowledge and the ability to conduct scientific research after a certain amount of production labor training, and should be organized to participate in scientific research work as much as possible in combination with teaching. The results should be used as one of the assessments of graduation grades.

V. Teaching Methods

Productive labor and scientific research play a great role in increasing practical knowledge and enriching teaching content, but they have certain one-sidedness and limitations. Each course has its own system and characteristics. In order to enable students to acquire relatively complete knowledge that combines theory with practice, the effective teaching links of the past must still be improved and strengthened after productive labor and scientific research are included in the teaching plan.

(1) Lectures: are a very important teaching method. On-site teaching plays a great role in enriching knowledge. Certain technically strong courses (such as surveying) can use on-site teaching, and certain chapters of certain courses can also use this method. Since each site has limitations, general courses cannot use on-site teaching to replace systematic and complete lectures. The number of lecture hours should also be appropriately arranged according to the nature of the course, and attention should be paid to improving quality.

(2) Classroom exercises: can enable students to master calculation skills, consolidate and deepen their learned knowledge, and also reduce extracurricular study time. Therefore, the number of classroom exercise hours should be appropriately arranged according to the nature of the course, and classroom discussions should be conducted in a few courses (such as political classes). In other courses, discussion methods can also be used to consolidate concepts that are not easy to understand.

(3) Experiment class: Since students participate in productive labor and scientific research, some experiments can be carried out in productive labor, but in general, the role of experiment class is still very important. The theory learned needs to be verified and consolidated through experiments, and some problems raised in productive labor and scientific research also need to be studied in the laboratory. Therefore, experiment classes need to be strengthened, laboratories should be further enriched, and experiments should be closely coordinated with productive labor and scientific research.

In order to consolidate, expand, and deepen the knowledge and experience of productive labor, and further connect with production practice, and cultivate students' ability to solve major technologies related to their major, three teaching methods, such as production practice, course design, and graduation design, must also be arranged according to the new situation. Production practice can generally be arranged twice, in the third and fourth academic years, respectively. The number of practice weeks can be arranged less than in the past, with a total of about ten weeks. The course design of technical foundation courses can be carried out at the same time as other courses, and the course design of professional courses can be arranged for six weeks of concentrated work. Graduation design (or thesis) is arranged in the second semester of the fifth year, for about twenty weeks. Go to the factory to collect materials, and no separate graduation practice is arranged during the graduation design time.

VI. Arrangement of Teaching Time

(1) Arrangement of weeks in the five-year study process:

Total number of weeks in five years: 260 weeks, of which:
	Productive labor: 52 weeks
	Vacation: 25 weeks
	Concentrated teaching: 183 weeks

(2) Arrangement of concentrated teaching weeks:

Total number of concentrated teaching weeks: 183 weeks, of which:
	Theoretical teaching: 129 weeks
	Production practice: 10 weeks
	Course design: 6 weeks
	Graduation design: 20 weeks
	Exams: 18 weeks

(3) Arrangement of total theoretical teaching hours and weekly study hours:

Total theoretical teaching hours: 3500-3800 hours, of which:
	Weekly study hours during the concentrated study period: 20-27, average 42 hours;
	Weekly study hours during the concentrated labor period: 12 hours

VII. Principles for Revising Teaching Outlines

(1) The teaching outline of each course in each major should meet the requirements of the teaching plan of that major.

(2) The teaching outline should include the basic knowledge of the subject and modern scientific knowledge or new technological achievements, and should reflect the current production practice in our country and related policies. The teaching outline should have a systematic overview of theoretical and production practice knowledge, with emphasis on different natures of courses.

(3) According to the requirements of the teaching plan and the characteristics of the course, the objectives, requirements and content of various teaching methods that are necessary and possible to connect with practice (such as experiments, classroom exercises, production practice, course design, etc.) should be stipulated in principle.

(4) The purpose and requirements for learning this course should be clearly stated.

VIII. Opinions on Compiling Teaching Materials

(1) Compiling teaching materials is a meticulous and complex task that requires considerable strength and a long time. Universally requiring teachers to compile teaching materials will affect their in-depth study of teaching content and scientific research work. Teaching and research groups with conditions (strong manpower, and accumulated rich teaching materials and experience) can compile teaching materials and should exchange them outside the school.

(2) Teaching and research groups with poor conditions do not necessarily have to compile teaching materials. They can choose to adopt existing textbooks or exchanged materials. If necessary, they can compile some supplementary teaching materials.

(3) It is hoped that the Ministry of Education can organize the work of compiling teaching materials nationwide. For certain courses, the compilation of teaching materials can be assigned to one or several schools with better conditions, and other relevant schools can also provide materials and opinions.

Delegates, from the perspective of higher education, on the basis of the great achievements made last year, how to further implement the Party's education policy, improve the quality of teaching, and make the combination of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor closer is the main task before us. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "For such a thorough revolution in education, we now only have preliminary experience, there are still shortcomings in our work, and there are still some issues that need to be further studied and resolved." Therefore, in the current work, we must continue to accumulate and summarize experience, carry out work in a thorough and meticulous manner, and conduct comprehensive research and proper arrangements for teaching, scientific research, and production work. I firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, giving free rein to the masses will surely overcome all difficulties and make schools increasingly develop into new-type schools that cultivate communist new people. Let us use the active actions of completing and overfulfilling the 1959 plan to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland!

### 高等工业学校怎样教学  金锡如代表的发言

专栏：

    高等工业学校怎样教学
    金锡如代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，和中央其他首长的报告，并愿衷心地贯彻执行。
    兹就高等工业学校深入教育革命中，关于修订教学计划、教学大纲和编写教材几个具体问题，作如下的发言。有不正确的地方，希望代表们批评、指正。
    一、培养目标
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指出：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”我国工农业生产大跃进，人民公社运动的发展，极为丰富的社会主义建设经验，为发展教育事业提出了更高的要求；经过去年以来我校执行党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的方针的实践；整风、反右、教育方针大辩论的胜利，群众觉悟大大提高，学生中党团员、左派占绝对优势；特别是党中央提出的提前五年实现“十二年科学发展规划”，尽快地赶上世界先进的科学和技术水平的伟大号召，给广大师生极大的鼓舞和力量。因此，我们认为工科大学培养的目标应该是：
    树立起社会主义共产主义人生观，具有系统的马克思列宁主义的基本理论知识；具有在现代科学技术水平基础上的专门知识，和一定的生产实际知识与生产劳动的经验，能够解决本专业范围内重大技术问题和独立进行科学研究工作，德育、智育、体育全面发展的人。
    二、生产劳动的内容和形式
    生产劳动列入教学计划，学生参加校内外的生产劳动，其主要意义和目的在于得到实际的劳动锻炼，培养社会主义共产主义的劳动观点、劳动态度和劳动人民的感情和获得生产实际知识。
    为了更好的组织生产劳动，学校应尽可能办工厂，学生参加的生产劳动应尽可能的与所学专业相结合。
    从过去学习苏联进行教学改革和我校去年以来执行“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的方针的经验和情况来看，在五年（二百六十周）的学习过程中，基本上按“一三八”安排（一个月的假期，三个月的劳动，八个月的学习），可以安排一年（五十二周）的生产劳动。五十二周的生产劳动分配在第一至第四学年，每年十三周，集中一次进行。第四学年学生以进行毕业设计和科学研究，接触生产实际的机会较多，不另安排生产劳动。
    劳动和学习的安排，采取集中与分散相结合的办法：在集中劳动期间，每周劳动三十六小时，每天六小时，同时每周安排十八小时的学习（除政治课外还适当安排两三门连续性的课程和结合生产劳动的课程）。在集中学习期间，每周安排四小时的非工业生产劳动。这样安排可以保持劳动和学习的连续性。
    每年十三周的劳动，集中一次进行，很有好处：有利于劳动锻炼；安排方式单纯，便于组织教学；易于提高技术水平，人力有较长期稳定，有利于生产。
    三、课程的安排
    我们去年修订教学计划，安排课程和教学大纲时，总的要求是以下三个原则：
    （一）理论部分必须加强，课程内容应力求精练（少而精）。
    （二）坚持理论联系实际的原则，生产劳动和科学研究列入教学计划（教学、生产劳动、科学研究相结合）。
    （三）鉴于过去在专业的培养目标方面，设计、制造、使用基本上是脱离的，因此对专业知识的要求必须是设计、制造、使用相结合，并根据不同专业有所侧重。
    经过去年的实践和反复的修改，我们认为各门课程的讲课、实验、课堂练习或课堂讨论的教学总时数应在三千五百至三千八百小时的范围，不宜过少。各类课程的教学时数及所占比重（以总学时三千八百小时为基数）如下：
    1、政治课程七百二十小时，占百分之十九
  （学习期间每周四小时，劳动期间每周二小时）。
    2、十门公共课程一千八百三十小时，占百分之四十八点二，其中：
    （1）数学、物理、普通化学三门课共计七百三十小时，占百分之十九点二（数学三百五十，物理二百六十，普通化学一百二十）。
    （2）俄文二百八十小时。
    （3）制图学、机械原理、机械零件、理论力学、材料力学、电工学等六门课共计八百二十小时。
    3、其他技术基础课和专业课程一千一百至一千一百五十小时，约占百分之二十九至三十。
    4、第二外国语一百至一百五十小时。
    5、体育列入教学计划，不排课，不计入教学时数，每天安排一小时的体育锻炼，但应有要求、有组织、有计划的进行。体育教师负责组织并训练学生体育干部，然后由学生体育干部协同体育教师指导体育锻炼。
    四、学生科学研究的安排原则
    我校的科学研究项目有：中央和省、市委托的；结合我校教学和校外生产的；基本理论方面的。
    去年八月以来，我校发动了广大的师生员工参加科学研究工作，根据现在科学研究情况及今后发展的需要，必须继续动员师生员工参加。但学生参加科学研究应根据科学研究任务的需要和学生的条件，不同年级作不同的安排。
    低年级（一、二年级）学生生产实践的锻炼和基本知识较少，每周安排的课程较多，一般不作要求，但应根据需要与可能，组织他们参加能够胜任的科学研究工作。每周时间一般不超过六小时。
    中年级（二、三年级）学生经过了一些生产劳动的锻炼，基本知识比低年级多些，科学研究也应比低年级多安排一些，分量不宜过大，可根据学习情况和科学研究任务的需要而定。
    高年级（四、五年级）学生经过了一定的生产劳动的锻炼，具有相当的专业知识和进行科学研究的能力，应尽量的结合教学，组织他们参加科学研究工作，其成果作为考核毕业成绩之一。
    五、教学方式
    生产劳动和科学研究对增加实际知识，丰富教学内容有很大的作用，但有一定的片面性和局限性。各门课程都有它的系统和特点。为使学生获得理论联系实际的比较完备的知识，在生产劳动和科学研究列入教学计划以后，对过去行之有效的教学环节仍须改进和加强。
    （一）讲课：是很重要的教学方式。现场教学对丰富知识有很大作用，某些技术性较强的课程（如测量学），可采用现场教学，某些课程的某些章节也可采用这个方式。由于每个现场均有局限性，一般的课程不能用现场教学来代替系统完整的讲课，还必须根据课程性质，适当安排讲课时数，并注意提高质量。
    （二）课堂练习：能使学生掌握运算技能，巩固和深化所学知识，同时也能减少课外学习时间，因此应根据课程性质，适当安排课堂练习时数，少数课程（如政治课）宜进行课堂讨论。在其他课程中对于不易理解的概念，也可采取讨论的方式加以巩固。
    （三）实验课：由于学生参加生产劳动和科学研究，有些实验可以在生产劳动中进行，但总的说来，实验课的作用仍然是很重要的。所学的理论需要通过实验加以印证和巩固，同时在生产劳动和科学研究中所提出的某些问题，也需要在实验室中进行研究。因此实验课需要加强，实验室也应进一步的充实，并要使实验与生产劳动和科学研究紧密配合。
    为了巩固、扩大和深化所学过的知识和生产劳动的经验，并进一步联系生产实际，和培养学生解决与本专业有关的重大技术的能力，生产实习、课程设计和毕业设计等三个教学方式，还必须根据新的情况加以安排。生产实习一般可安排两次，分别在第三、第四两学年内进行。实习周数可较过去少排一些，总共约十周左右。技术基础课的课程设计可以和其他课程同时进行，专业课的课程设计，可安排六周的时间集中进行。毕业设计（或论文）安排在第五年下期，时间是二十周左右，下厂搜集资料，在毕业设计时间内，不另排毕业实习。
    六、教学时间的安排
    （一）五年学习过程中周数的安排：
    五年期间总周数：260周，其中生产劳动…………52周假期…………25周集中教学…………183周
    （二）集中教学周数的安排：
    集中教学总周数：183周，其中理论教学…………129周生产实习…………10周课程设计…………6周毕业设计…………20周考试…………18周
    （三）理论教学总时数和周学时数的安排：
    理论教学总时数：3500—3800小时，其中
    集中学习期间的周学时数：20—27，平均42小时；集中劳动期间的周学时数：12小时
  七、修订教学大纲原则
    （一）每个专业每门课程的教学大纲要满足该专业教学计划的要求。
    （二）教学大纲应包括本门学科的基本知识和现代科学知识或新的技术成就，并应反映出我国当前生产实际和与之有关的方针政策上的问题。教学大纲要有系统的理论和生产实际知识的概括，并根据课程的性质有所侧重。
    （三）根据教学计划的要求和课程的特点，对必要和可能的联系实际的各种教学方式（例如实验、课堂练习、生产实习、课程设计等）的目的要求和内容，要作出原则上的规定。
    （四）要明确提出学习本门课程的目的和要求。
    八、编写教材的意见
    （一）编写教材是一个细致复杂的工作，需要较大的力量和较长的时间。普遍地要求教师编写教材，将会影响他们的钻研教学内容和科学研究工作。有条件的教研组（人力较强，并又积累了较丰富的教学资料和经验），可以编写教材，并应向校外交流。
    （二）条件较差的教研组，不一定要编写教材，可就已有的教本或在交流的教材中选择采用，根据实际需要，必要时可编写一部分补充教材。
    （三）希望教育部能在全国范围内，对编写教材工作加以组织，某些课程的教材，可以指定某个或某几个条件较好的学校编写，其他有关的学校也可供给资料和意见。
    代表们，从高等教育来看，在去年已取得巨大成绩基础上，如何深入贯彻党的教育方针，使教学质量再提高一步，使教学、科学研究、生产劳动三者结合的更加紧密，这是摆在我们面前的主要课题。正如周总理在报告中指出的“对于教育事业上的这样一个彻底的革命，我们现在还只具有初步的经验，工作中还有缺点，也还存在着一些需要进一步研究解决的问题”。因此在当前工作中必须继续积累和总结经验，深入细致地进行工作，对教学、科学研究、生产工作，通盘研究，妥善安排。我完全相信在党的正确领导下，放手发动群众，一定会克服一切困难，使学校日益发展成为培养共产主义新人的新型学校。让我们用完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，来迎接我们的伟大祖国国庆十周年吧。
