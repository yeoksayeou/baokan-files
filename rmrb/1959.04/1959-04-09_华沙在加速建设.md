    Warsaw is Accelerating Construction

    Warsaw, the Polish capital rebuilt from ruins, will be built even more beautifully in the next seven years.

    The Warsaw City People's Committee recently approved the capital's development plan for 1959-1965. According to this plan, in the seven years, in addition to central investment, 15 billion zlotys (Polish currency) will be invested in Warsaw's construction. During this period, in addition to the complete commencement of operations at the Warsaw Quality Steel Plant, a number of new factories will also be built.

    Within seven years, it is expected that 287,000 housing units will be built. Many families currently living in old houses, basements, or attics will receive better housing. In the newly built workers' villages, roads, small parks, schools, shops, and clinics will be vigorously built. The Warsaw Development Seven-Year Plan stipulates the construction of 290 kilometers of sewer pipes and 400 kilometers of water pipes. 90% of residents will use tap water, and 85% of residents will use gas. The amount of construction each year in the Seven-Year Plan is two to three times more than the fastest period of Warsaw's development before the war, in 1938.

    During 1959-1965, Warsaw will build three department stores, approximately one thousand new stores, as well as some cinemas and theaters.

    In order to ensure convenient transportation in the city, the plan stipulates that 1,200 trams and 600 buses will be added, and new main lines, tram lines, and roads will be vigorously built. In addition, two new bridges will be built over the Vistula River, and two new railway stations will be built in the city.

    The plan stipulates that twenty-four vocational schools will be added to the capital within seven years. By 1965, the number of students in Warsaw's primary and secondary schools will also increase.

    The plan also stipulates that medical conditions in the capital will be greatly improved within seven years. In the next few years, at least twenty-two new clinics, blood transfusion stations, and sanitation and epidemic prevention stations will be built, and emergency stations will be expanded. The total number of beds will increase by 50% compared to the present. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    华沙在加速建设
    华沙，这个在废墟上重建起来的波兰首都，在今后七年中，将建设得更加美丽。
    华沙市人民委员会最近通过了1959—1965年首都发展计划。按照这个计划，在七年内，除了中央投资外，用于华沙的建设投资将为一百五十亿兹罗提（波币）。在这个时期，除了华沙优质钢厂完全开工外，还要新建一批工厂。
    七年内，预计要建造二十八万七千间住房。目前住在旧房子、地下室或顶楼的许多家庭都将得到较好的住宅。在新建的工人村内，将大力修建道路、小公园、学校、商店和诊疗所等。华沙发展七年计划规定建筑二百九十公里长的下水道管和四百公里长的自来水管。90％的居民将使用自来水，85％的居民将使用瓦斯。七年计划中每一年的建筑量都比战前华沙发展最快的1938年要多两倍到三倍。
    在1959—1965年期间，华沙将建成三家百货公司、约一千家新的商店以及一些电影院和剧院等。
    为了保证城市有方便的交通，计划规定增加电车一千二百辆，公共汽车六百辆，并大力建筑新的干线、电车线和公路。此外，维斯杜拉河上将新建两座桥梁，市内将新建两个火车站。
    计划规定，七年内首都将增设二十四所职业学校。到1965年，华沙市初级学校和中学的学生人数亦将增加。
    计划还规定，七年中要大力改善首都的医疗条件。在最近几年内将至少建成二十二个新的诊疗所、输血站和卫生防疫站，并将扩大急救站。病床总数将比现在增加50％。　（据新华社讯）（附图片）
