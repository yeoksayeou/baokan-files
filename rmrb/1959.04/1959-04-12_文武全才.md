　　A Man of Both Letters and Arms
　　Yi Heyuan
　　Of the seventy-two trades, every one produces an expert. Great things can be achieved in every profession, and there are heroes to use their talents. Let’s talk about playing table tennis.

　　Our table tennis player, Rong Guotuan, won the men's singles championship in last year's national table tennis competition – he became the top scorer; in the recently held 25th World Table Tennis Championships, he won the world men's singles championship – he became the world's top table tennis scorer, winning honor for the motherland.

　　There is only one top scorer, but there are many heroes competing for the title, and each of them is highly skilled and outstanding. To win the top spot, one must be the best among the best, one must be victorious in every battle, defeating all the heroes, which is really easier said than done!

　　To defeat opponents, high skill is of course the most basic condition, but this is not enough, one must also use one's brain and fight with intelligence. In old novels, we often see that when some military generals cannot win against strong opponents, they often use tricks to turn defeat into victory. For example, Guan Yu was accustomed to using the "dragging knife trick," Luo Cheng had the "returning spear," and Qin Qiong had the "锏 (jiǎn) mace as a final move." We often see this situation in table tennis matches as well. Rong Guotuan was able to defeat all the heroes, pass eight levels in a row, and win the championship in this World Table Tennis Championships men's singles competition, not only because of his superb and relatively comprehensive skills, but also because he was calm, good at using his intelligence, knew himself and his opponents, and adapted to the circumstances. Take his battle against the American player Miles as an example. He won the first game, then lost two games in a row, but he remained calm and used chop shots to deal with the opponent, making the opponent unable to hold back, and finally won two games in a row, winning the right to the final. He also demonstrated this point in the competition for the championship with the Hungarian veteran Sido. He had lost to Sido in the team competition. After that, he studied Sido's playing style, adopted countermeasures in the singles final, and won the victory.

　　When Rong Guotuan formulated the leap forward plan last year, he proposed: strive to win the world singles championship in 1961. It is gratifying and congratulatory that his plan has been completed two years ahead of schedule!

　　After reading the reports of this World Table Tennis Championships and Rong Guotuan's winning the world singles championship, I was inspired with some thoughts.

　　Everyone, regardless of the difference in industry, the height of the position, or the size of the responsibility, should have their own ambitions – to complete the tasks they undertake outstandingly. Although the ambitions are different, the goal is the same: how to better build socialism and communism. As the saying goes, "Where there's a will, there's a way," which makes sense, but there must also be a prerequisite, that is, the "will" must be practical, and one must go through hard work to develop real skills, not just having great ambitions but lacking talent, or just talking empty words. "Having the talent to govern the country and the ambition to soar into the clouds," these are the words used in history to describe those heroic figures. It means that people should have both talent and ambition. If one has talent but no ambition, one's talent cannot be brought into play; if one has ambition but no talent, one's ambition is difficult to achieve. Rong Guotuan dared to make the grand ambition of winning the world table tennis championship, on the one hand, because of the Party's help, care, and encouragement, which liberated his thinking, and on the other hand, because he did have a fairly high level of technical skill – boldness comes from mastery. Therefore, through down-to-earth hard work and the use of both hands and brains in the competition, he achieved "Where there's a will, there's a way."

　　In my opinion, talent is not only courage, but also includes strategy. Having both courage and strategy, using both hands and brains, is considered a man of both letters and arms. Taking playing table tennis as an example, Rong Guotuan can be regarded as a man of both letters and arms with courage and strategy. Many heroes and models who have emerged on all fronts of our socialist construction are also people with both literary and military skills. They can both charge forward and not bow their heads in the face of difficulties; they can also plan and strategize to defeat the enemy, and cleverly seize passes, so they can be invincible and overcome all obstacles, and achieve "Where there's a will, there's a way" in all walks of life.

　　文武全才
　　易和元
    七十二行，行行出状元。各行各业都大有文章可做，都有英雄用武之地。且谈一谈打乒乓球。
    我国乒乓球运动员容国团，在去年全国乒乓球比赛中赢得男子单打冠军——中了状元；在不久前举行的第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛中，又荣获世界男子单打冠军——中了世界乒乓球状元，为祖国争得荣誉。
    状元只有一个，而争状元的好汉，却人数众多，而且一个个都是武艺高强，出类拔萃的。要夺得状元，就要作能手中的能手，就要百战百胜，击败众家英雄，真是谈何容易！
    要战胜对手，武艺高强当然是最基本的条件，但是这还不够，还得用脑子，斗智。在旧小说里我们常常看到，有些武将在与强手对敌不能取胜的时候，往往用计反败为胜。例如关云长就惯使“拖刀计”，罗成有“回马枪”，秦琼有“杀手锏”。在乒乓球比赛中也常常看到这种情况。容国团在这次世界乒乓球锦标赛男子单打比赛中，所以能力败群雄，连闯八关，夺得冠军，这除了他的技术的精湛和比较全面之外，还在于他头脑冷静，善于用智，知己知彼，临机应变，且看他战败美国选手迈耳斯的那一场。他先赢了一局，接着连输了两局，但他仍保持镇静，以搓球对付对方，使对方沉不住气，终于连胜两局，争得了决赛权。在同匈牙利老将西多争夺冠军中，也表现了这一点。在团体赛中，他曾败给西多，之后，他研究了西多的打法，在单打决赛中，就采取了对策，结果获得胜利。
    容国团在去年订跃进规划时，就提出：争取在1961年获得世界单打冠军。可喜可贺的是他的这一计划已经提前两年完成了！
    看了这次世界乒乓球锦标赛的报道，和容国团的荣获世界单打冠军，倒引起我一些感想。
    每个人，不管行业的不同，职位的高低，所负责任的大小，都应该各有各的志气——在所担负的工作中出色地完成任务。志气虽不同，而目标却是一个：如何更好地建设社会主义和共产主义。俗话说：“有志者事竟成”，这是有道理的，但是还须有一个先决条件，就是“志”要立得切合实际，而且要经过艰苦的努力，练得真实的本领，不是志大才疏，空口说白话。“有经邦济世之才，步月凌云之志”，这是历史上形容那些英雄人物的话。说的是人应该才志兼备。有才而无志的，其才便无法得到发挥；有志而无才的，其志也便难得实现。容国团敢于立下争夺世界乒乓球冠军的宏愿，一方面是由于党的帮助、关怀和鼓励，解放了思想，一方面确也因为自己有相当高的技术水平——艺高人胆大。所以经过踏踏实实的勤学苦练，在比赛中的手脑并用，做到了“有志者事竟成”。
    所谓才，在我看来，不单是勇，而且包括谋，有勇有谋，手脑并用，才算得是文武全才，拿打乒乓球来说，容国团可算是有勇有谋的文武全才了。在我们社会主义建设各条战线上涌现出来的许多英雄模范，也都是文武双全的人。他们既能冲锋陷阵，在困难面前不低头；又能运谋制敌，巧夺关隘，因而能战无不胜，攻无不克，在各行各业都做到有志者事竟成了。
