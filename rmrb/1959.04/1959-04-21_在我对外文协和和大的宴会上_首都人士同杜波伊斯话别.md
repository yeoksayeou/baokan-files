Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: After visiting China for more than two months, the famous American black scholar Dr. Du Bois and his wife are about to leave China. This noon, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace hosted a farewell banquet for the distinguished guests.

At this emotional farewell banquet, Dr. Du Bois and his wife, together with well-known figures from all walks of life in China, including Chu Tunan, Zhang Xiruo, Shi Liang, Li Dequan, Zhang Zhixiang, Wu Han, Tang Mingzhao, etc., gathered together to express their sentiments of parting. When Chu Tunan delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, he hoped that the distinguished guests would convey the Chinese people's good wishes and friendship to the American people, and also hoped that Dr. and Mrs. Du Bois would visit China again as guests. Dr. Du Bois said to his Chinese hosts that in his long life, he had traveled to many places in the world, but he had never felt such deep affection as he did when he was about to leave China. He felt that leaving China was like leaving his beloved family. Dr. Du Bois's wife was so emotionally moved at the banquet that she was constantly talking and laughing. She said in poetic language: "The China I see is so beautiful, the children, women, and all the people of China are so happy. China is a wonderful country!"

    在我对外文协和和大的宴会上
    首都人士同杜波伊斯话别
    据新华社20日讯　美国著名黑人学者杜波伊斯博士和他的夫人在中国访问了两个多月以后，即将离开中国。今天中午，中国人民对外文化协会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会设宴为贵宾们饯行。
    在这个依依惜别的宴会上，杜波伊斯博士和他的夫人，同中国各界著名人士楚图南、张奚若、史良、李德全、张致祥、吴晗、唐明照等，欢聚一起，畅述惜别之情。楚图南在代表中国人民对外文化协会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会致欢送词的时候，他希望贵宾们把中国人民对美国人民的良好愿望和友谊，转达给美国人民，并且希望杜波伊斯博士夫妇再到中国来作客。杜波伊斯博士对他的中国主人说，在他长长的一生中，他旅行过世界上的许多地方，但是，从来没像要离开中国这样满怀恋恋深情。他感到离开中国就好像要离开自己心爱的家庭一样。杜波伊斯博士的夫人在宴会上是那样地感情激动，她一直谈笑风生。她用诗一般的语言说：“我看到的中国是这样的美丽，中国的儿童、妇女和所有的人都是那样幸福。中国是一个美好的国家！”
