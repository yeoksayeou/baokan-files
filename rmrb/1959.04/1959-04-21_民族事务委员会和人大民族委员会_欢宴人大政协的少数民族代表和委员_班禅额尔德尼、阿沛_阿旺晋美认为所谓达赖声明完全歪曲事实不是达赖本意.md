Xinhua News Agency, 20th – The Nationalities Affairs Committee of the People's Republic of China and the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress jointly held a banquet at the Beijing Hotel on the evening of the 19th, warmly welcoming Panchen Erdeni, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and all ethnic minority representatives and members attending the first session of the Second National People's Congress and the first session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

On the evening of the 19th, the banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel was filled with a joyful atmosphere. Representatives and members from all corners of the motherland, each with boundless excitement, repeatedly clinked glasses with each other, celebrating the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, celebrating the prosperity of the socialist construction of the motherland, and wishing a long life to Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups.

At the banquet, the representatives and members also especially congratulated the victory of the rapid suppression of the rebellion in the Lhasa area and celebrated the new life of the Tibetan people.

Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, spoke first at the banquet, extending a warm welcome to Panchen Erdeni, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and all the representatives and members attending the banquet. Vice Premier Ulanhu said that in the past few years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country has been unprecedentedly strengthened. The failure of the armed rebellion launched by the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet not long ago has further consolidated the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the politics, economy, and culture of all ethnic groups in our country have developed rapidly. In 1958, the economy and culture of various ethnic minority areas, like the whole country, also made great leaps forward.

Vice Premier Ulanhu said that, as everyone knows, this National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are a grand gathering of the great unity and great leap forward of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, which is a tremendous encouragement to the people of all ethnic groups in our country. We firmly believe that the people of all ethnic groups in our country will unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and make greater contributions to the unity of the country and ethnic solidarity, and to the socialist construction of our country.

Panchen Erdeni then spoke, saying that in the past few years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our great motherland has become more unified and consolidated, the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country has been unprecedentedly strengthened, and the politics, economy, and culture of all ethnic groups in our country have developed rapidly. All this fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

Panchen Erdeni said that the armed rebellion launched by the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet not long ago has suffered a shameful defeat. During this period, the people of all ethnic groups in the country gave the Tibetan people warm support and deep concern, thereby powerfully defending the unity of the motherland. This profoundly demonstrates the loving unity, mutual assistance, and inseparable relationship among all ethnic groups. On behalf of the Tibetan people, please allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the people of all ethnic groups.

Panchen Erdeni said that the statement issued yesterday in the name of the Dalai Lama completely reverses black and white, distorts the facts, and is completely fabricated. Obviously, this is due to coercion by reactionaries and is definitely not the Dalai Lama's original intention. I and the Tibetan people feel great anger about this and express our firm opposition.

Panchen Erdeni said that this National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are a grand gathering of the great unity and great leap forward of all ethnic groups in our country, which has given us tremendous encouragement. We firmly believe that the newly reborn Tibetan people will, from now on, unite more closely with the people of all ethnic groups around the great Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and contribute their greatest strength to the unification of the motherland, ethnic unity, and socialist construction.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said in his speech that the unity and unification of the people of all ethnic groups in our country have been formed through long-term historical development. Imperialists have consistently conspired to undermine the unity and unification of all ethnic groups in the motherland. Their evil aims are completely contrary to the will and wishes of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and are contrary to the development of historical facts, so they will never be realized. Recently, the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion of betraying the motherland and undermining unity, provoked by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique in collusion with imperialism, has suffered a shameful defeat.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that the statement issued in the name of the Dalai Lama on April 18 was not what the Dalai Lama wanted, but was what the Dalai Lama was forced to do after being kidnapped by traitors. The entire content of this statement distorts the facts, and I am firmly opposed to it. The failure of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Tibet has further strengthened the unity and unification of all ethnic groups in the motherland and cleared the way for the Tibetan people to quickly embark on a socialist happy paradise.

At the banquet, Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet, and Liu Geping, Chairman of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, rose to propose a toast one after another. In their toasts, they proposed a toast to the consolidation of the unity of the motherland and the victory of the socialist construction of the people of all ethnic groups. Following their proposal, all the people attending the banquet stood up, raised their glasses, and once again warmly congratulated each other.

Xu Bing and Ping Jiesan, Deputy Ministers of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, were invited to attend the banquet. Those attending the banquet included the leaders of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress and the Nationalities Affairs Commission, the leaders of various autonomous regions and relevant provinces among the representatives and members attending the banquet, and the accompanying officials of Panchen Erdeni. A total of more than 400 people attended the banquet.

After the banquet, the Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed wonderful acrobatic and song and dance programs for the representatives and members.

    民族事务委员会和人大民族委员会
    欢宴人大政协的少数民族代表和委员
    班禅额尔德尼、阿沛·阿旺晋美认为所谓达赖声明完全歪曲事实不是达赖本意
    新华社20日讯　中华人民共和国民族事务委员会和全国人民代表大会民族委员会19日晚间在北京饭店联合举行宴会，热烈欢迎班禅额尔德尼、阿沛·阿旺晋美和出席全国人民代表大会第二届第一次会议和出席全国政协第三届第一次会议的全体少数民族代表和委员。
    19日晚，北京饭店宴会厅充满一片喜气洋洋的景象。来自祖国四面八方的代表和委员们，每一个人都怀着无限兴奋的心情，一再相互碰杯，欢庆祖国各民族人民的大团结，欢庆祖国社会主义建设繁荣昌盛，祝福各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席，万寿无疆。
    宴会上，代表和委员们还特别祝贺拉萨地区迅速平息叛乱的胜利，祝贺西藏人民的新生。
    国务院副总理、民族事务委员会主任乌兰夫在宴会上首先讲话，他向参加宴会的班禅额尔德尼、阿沛·阿旺晋美和全体代表和委员表示热烈的欢迎。乌兰夫副总理说，几年以来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，我国各民族人民的团结空前地加强了。不久以前，西藏上层反动集团所发动的武装叛乱的失败，更进一步地巩固了祖国的统一和民族团结。几年以来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，我国各民族的政治、经济和文化得到了迅速地发展。1958年各少数民族地区的经济、文化和全国一样也有了巨大的跃进。
    乌兰夫副总理说，正如大家所知道的，这次全国人民代表大会和政协全国委员会是我国各民族人民大团结的大会、大跃进的大会，这对于我国各民族人民是一个莫大的鼓舞。我们深信，我国各民族人民将更加紧密地团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的周围，为国家的统一和民族团结、为我国社会主义建设事业作出更大的贡献。
    班禅额尔德尼接着讲话，他说，几年以来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们的伟大祖国更加统一和巩固了，我国各族人民的团结空前加强了，我国各民族的政治、经济、文化得到了迅速的发展，这一切都充分地说明社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    班禅额尔德尼说，不久以前，西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱已经遭到可耻的失败，在此期间，全国各族人民给了西藏人民热情支援和深切关怀，从而有力地捍卫了祖国的统一，这深刻地表现了各民族友爱团结、互相帮助、紧密难分的关系。对此请允许我代表西藏人民谨向各族人民致以诚挚的感谢。
    班禅额尔德尼说，昨日，以达赖喇嘛的名义所发表的声明，完全是颠倒黑白，歪曲事实，完全是捏造的。显然，这是由于反动分子威逼强迫所致，而决非达赖喇嘛的本意。对此，我和西藏人民感到极大愤怒，并表示坚决反对。
    班禅额尔德尼说，这次全国人民代表大会和政协全国委员会，是我国各民族大团结的大会，大跃进的大会，给了我们极大的鼓舞，我们坚信获得了新生的西藏人民，今后一定会和各族人民一道，更加紧密地团结在伟大的中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的周围，为祖国统一、民族团结，为社会主义建设贡献出自己最大的力量。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美在讲话中说，我国各民族人民的团结和统一是长期历史发展形成的。帝国主义者一贯阴谋破坏祖国各民族的团结和统一，他们的罪恶目的是完全违背我国各民族人民的意志和愿望的，是违背历史事实的发展的，因此，永远也不能实现。最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义所挑起的背叛祖国、破坏统一的反革命武装叛乱，已经遭到可耻失败。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说，4月18日以达赖喇嘛的名义发表的声明，不是达赖喇嘛本心所愿的，而是叛国分子劫持达赖喇嘛之后，威迫达赖喇嘛所做的，这个声明全部内容是歪曲事实的，我是坚决反对。现在西藏反革命叛乱的失败，更进一步加强了祖国各民族的团结和统一，为西藏人民迅速走上社会主义幸福乐园扫清了道路。
    宴会上，中央人民政府驻西藏代表张经武、人大民族委员会主任委员刘格平先后起立祝酒，他们在祝酒中提议为祖国统一的巩固，各民族人民社会主义建设的胜利干杯，随着他们的提议，出席宴会的人们全体起立，高举酒杯，互相再一次热烈祝贺。
    中共中央统一战线工作部副部长徐冰、平杰三应邀出席了宴会。出席宴会的有人大民族委员会和民族事务委员会的负责人，出席宴会的代表和委员中有各自治区和有关省的负责人，出席宴会的还有班禅额尔德尼的随行官员等，出席宴会的共有四百多人。
    宴会后，中国人民解放军总政治部文工团向代表和委员们演出了精彩的杂技、歌舞节目。
