Ganzhou, April 21st (reported by this newspaper) – In Ganxian, Jiangxi Province, all the people's communes are earnestly implementing the policy of democratic commune management and adhering to the "People's Commune Democratic Management Regulations" (attached below) formulated by the county party committee. On the one hand, cadres are more deeply listening to the opinions and demands of the masses and consulting with them on matters. On the other hand, the communes are mobilizing and absorbing the broad masses to participate in various management tasks of the commune. As a result, the enthusiasm of the commune members is fully mobilized, and production is being carried out vigorously.

The seventeen people's communes in Ganxian were all established at the end of last year. In order to consolidate the communes and ensure the continued leap forward of production this year, the CCP Ganxian County Committee, shortly after the establishment of the communes, led cadres and commune members to carry out a major debate on how to implement the democratic commune management policy. At the beginning of the debate, there were different understandings. Some believed that after the establishment of the communes, the ideological awareness of the commune members had improved, and cadres only needed to make arrangements, without the need for democratic commune management. Others said that production was busy during the Great Leap Forward, and there was no time to implement the democratic commune management policy. During the debate, each commune adopted the method of recalling and comparing, using typical examples of promoting democracy within the commune to educate cadres and commune members, so that everyone realized: only by promoting democracy can we give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and develop production quickly and well. On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, cadres and commune members put forward many measures for democratic commune management. The county party committee, based on these measures and past experiences of agricultural cooperatives, and in combination with the characteristics of the communes, formulated "Twenty-Five Articles for Democratic Management of People's Communes." After trial implementation in key communes, it was universally promoted in all communes throughout the county.

Since the communes in Ganxian have adhered to the "Twenty-Five Articles for Democratic Management of People's Communes," cadres consult with the masses on everything and widely mobilize and absorb commune members to participate in various management tasks of the commune. Commune members have unified will and cheerful moods, and they are doing everything possible to improve production and manage the commune well. Xiao Meizi, a more than fifty-year-old commune member of Xiawen Commune, treats the affairs of the commune as if they were his own family, doing things whenever he sees them. He often says: "I am the master of the commune, and I must wholeheartedly serve the commune." Recently, Xiao Meizi was rated as a model of loving the commune by the commune members. Hanfang Commune is in a mountainous area and lacks paddy fields. Commune member Peng Duorong actively came up with ideas and took the initiative to suggest to the commune that vegetables be planted on the ridges of the fields and cash crops be planted in the vegetable plots, so that the land freed up by the cash crops could be used to expand the planting of rice. After research, the commune adopted Peng Duorong's suggestion, increasing the rice acreage by more than 1,000 mu this year. Huangjin Brigade of Huangjin Commune had a large rice transplanting task, short time, and tight labor this year. At the beginning of rice transplanting, it was calculated that the plan could not be completed on schedule. Later, after the cadres told the commune members about this difficulty, all the commune members actively offered suggestions. Some commune members thought of ideas while sleeping in bed at night and immediately got up and ran to tell the cadres. Within a few days, the entire team put forward more than 1,000 suggestions, selected experienced farmers to manage and direct the rice transplanting teams, and the team cadres rationally arranged the labor force. As a result, the rice transplanting task was completed half a month ahead of schedule.

Because the broad masses of cadres have established a system of regular contact with the masses and strengthened work investigation and research, their work is also going smoothly. Zeng Xingzhi, secretary of the Hanfang Commune Party Committee, used to regard the Meijie Brigade as the base of his work, but his understanding of the situation and deployment of work often stopped at the brigade cadre meetings and rarely penetrated into the production teams and commune member families. As a result, his understanding of the situation was sometimes incomplete, and the deployment of work was sometimes impractical. This year, he changed this working method, not only mastering the base team, but also establishing friendly relations with many commune members in this team. Recently, Zeng Xingzhi learned from commune members with whom he had friendly relations that the progress of rice transplanting in Meijie Brigade was slow due to insufficient skillful work. He immediately organized a discussion with the brigade party secretary and launched a high-efficiency rice transplanting campaign in the entire team. In this way, the rice transplanting progress of each commune member increased from two fen of land to five fen of land per day, accelerating the rice transplanting progress of the entire team by more than double. Later, Zeng Xingzhi used the telephone to spread this experience to other production teams, greatly accelerating the rice transplanting progress of the entire commune.

**Key Points of the Ganxian People's Commune Democratic Management Regulations**

**For Cadres:**

1.  Establish a system of regular contact with the masses, visiting commune members household by household on a regular basis and establishing "friend households." Cadres above the management area level should visit commune members within their contracted area once per quarter; each person should establish three to five friend households as their regular contact base. Through visits and making friends, cadres should conduct in-depth investigations and research, and widely solicit and listen to commune members' opinions on all aspects of the commune and their own work.
2.  In order to continuously improve the work of cadres, cadres at all levels should make regular work reports to commune members, with team-level cadres reporting once every half month, management area level cadres reporting once a month, and commune-level cadres reporting once a quarter; cadres report their work to commune members, who examine and evaluate it.
3.  Major cadres above the management area level should preside over a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" once in each agricultural season, absorbing experienced farmers and farmers with rich experience in a certain field to concentrate their experience and wisdom in order to better arrange and direct the production of this season.
4.  All full-time cadres of the commune should take turns to go down to the production teams and work as commune members for one to three months each year, participating in production and assisting the production team in leading production, exploring and summarizing the typical production experience of production teams and commune members, and immediately studying and solving problems with the masses, or reporting to the leadership for handling in a timely manner.
5.  Financial management cadres at all levels should ensure that accounts are cleared daily and settled monthly. After clearing the accounts each month, methods such as listing and posting announcements and explaining door-to-door should be used to submit the accounts to commune members for review.

**For the Masses:**

1.  Major matters such as the commune's production plan, financial budget, income distribution, labor organization, and cadre appointments should be decided by the commune members' representative assembly based on the opinions of the commune members. The commune should convene a commune members' representative assembly four times a year, and the management area should convene a commune members' representative meeting twice each season. The commune member representatives should include members from each production team and all aspects.
2.  Carry out "taking the commune as home" education on a regular basis, establish a social ethos in which everyone loves the commune, so that every commune member can complete their production tasks, do things at any time and place when they see them, cherish commune property; and actively report situations and make suggestions to cadres to help them carry out their work.
3.  In order to stimulate the production enthusiasm of each commune member, regular competitions and comparisons should be carried out between production brigades, teams, and commune members within the commune to evaluate model collectives and activists in socialist construction. At the same time, each production team should establish attendance books, merit and demerit books, and attendance books for extra-strength labor, with dedicated personnel recording daily, as the basis for evaluation and wage distribution.
4.  Absorb old farmers and model commune members or farmers with special skills to participate in the management of all aspects of the commune's production, life, finance, labor, etc., at all levels of organizations; and set up big-character poster platforms everywhere in the fields, by the roadside, in offices, and in canteens, so that commune members can put forward opinions and suggestions at any time.

### 赣县实行公社民主管理条例  干部深入群众求师交友同甘共苦通气连心  社员意志统一心情舒畅计谋如泉干劲冲天

    赣县实行公社民主管理条例
    干部深入群众求师交友同甘共苦通气连心
    社员意志统一心情舒畅计谋如泉干劲冲天
    本报赣州21日电　江西省赣县各个人民公社，认真执行民主办社方针，坚持按照县委制订的人民公社民主管理条例（附后）办事，一方面使干部更加深入地听取群众意见和要求，遇事同群众商量，一方面发动和吸收广大群众参加公社的各项管理工作，因而广大社员的积极性得以充分发挥，生产搞得轰轰烈烈。
    赣县十七个人民公社都是在去年年底成立的。中共赣县县委为了巩固公社和保证今年生产继续大跃进计划的实现，在公社成立后不久便领导各公社干部和社员，开展了一次以怎样贯彻执行民主办社方针为专题的大辩论。辩论开始时认识不同，有的认为公社成立后社员思想觉悟提高了，只要干部布置一下就行，用不着搞民主办社；有的说，大跃进中生产繁忙，挤不出时间来贯彻执行民主办社方针。在辩论中，各公社采用回忆、对比的办法，用本社内发扬民主的典型事例对干部和社员进行了一次民主办社的教育，从而使大家认识到：只有发扬民主，才能发挥广大社员的积极性，又快又好地发展生产。在统一思想认识的基础上，干部和社员们提出了许多民主办社的措施。县委根据这些措施和过去农业社的经验，结合公社特点制订了“人民公社民主管理二十五条”，经过重点社试行之后，便在全县各公社普遍推行。
    赣县各个人民公社坚持执行“人民公社民主管理二十五条”以后，由于干部事事同群众商量，广泛发动和吸收社员参加公社各项管理工作，社员们意志统一、心情舒畅，千方百计搞好生产，办好公社。下汶公社五十多岁老社员萧梅子把社里的事情当作家里的一样，见事就做，他常说：“我是公社的主人，就要一心一意为公社。”最近萧梅子被社员评为爱社模范。韩坊公社是山区，缺水田。社员彭多荣积极想办法，主动向公社建议利用田埂种蔬菜，利用蔬菜地种经济作物，这样，空出了种经济作物的土地扩种水稻。公社经过研究后采用了彭多荣的建议，使全社今年增加了一千多亩水稻。黄金公社黄金大队今年插秧任务大、时间短、劳力紧，插秧开始时据计算不能按期完成计划。后来干部把这个困难告诉社员后，全队社员积极出谋定计。有的社员深夜睡在床上想出了计谋，马上起床披衣跑去告诉干部。几天内全队提出了一千多条建议，选出了有经验的农民管理和指挥插秧队伍，队干部合理安排了劳动力，结果提前半月完成了插秧任务。
    广大干部由于建立了经常联系群众的制度，加强了工作调查研究，因此他们的工作也很顺手。韩坊公社党委书记曾兴志过去把梅街大队做为自己工作的基点，但是了解情况、布置工作往往只停留在大队干部会议上，很少深入到生产小组、社员家庭，因而了解的情况有的不全面，布置工作有时不切实际。今年他改变了这种工作方法，不仅掌握这个基点队，还和这个队的许多社员建立了朋友关系。最近曾兴志从有朋友关系的社员那里了解到梅街大队插秧进度慢，是巧干不够的缘故。他立即和大队支部书记一同组织社员讨论，在全队开展了插秧高工效运动。这样，每个社员每天插秧进度就由二分田提高到五分田，使全队插秧进度加快了一倍多。后来，曾兴志又用电话把这项经验传播给其他生产队，从而大大加快了全社的插秧进度。
                    （刘光辉）
    赣县人民公社民主管理条例（要点）
    在干部方面：一、建立定期逐户访问社员和建立“朋友户”的经常联系群众的制度。管理区级以上的干部，每人每季度逐户访问一次自己包干片内的社员；每人建立三、五个朋友户，做为自己经常联系的基点。干部通过访问、交朋友，深入进行调查研究，广泛征求和听取社员对公社各方面和自己工作上的意见。
    二、为了不断改进干部的工作，各级干部定期向社员作工作报告，生产队级干部半月一次，管理区级干部一月一次，公社级干部一季一次；干部向社员汇报自己的工作，由社员检查、鉴定。
    三、管理区级以上主要干部，每个农事季节中要主持召开一次“诸葛亮会”，吸收老农和某项经验丰富的农民参加，集中他们的经验和智慧，以便更好地安排和指挥这个季度的生产。
    四、公社所有脱产干部每年轮流下放到生产小队当一至三个月社员，除参加生产和协助生产小组领导生产外，摸索和总结生产小组、社员的典型生产经验，发现问题马上同群众研究解决，或及时向领导汇报处理。
    五、各级财务管理干部做到日清月结，每月结清账目后，运用列榜公布和登门讲解等方法，把账目交社员审查。
    在群众方面：一、公社的生产规划、财政预算、收入分配、劳动组织和干部任用等重大事项，都由社员代表大会根据社员的意见做决定。公社每年召开四次社员代表大会，管理区每个季节召开二次社员代表会，社员代表包括每个生产队和各个方面的成员。
    二、经常开展“以社为家”的教育，树立人人爱社的风气，使每个社员都能完成自己的生产任务，作到随时随地见事做事，爱惜公社财产；并主动向干部反映情况、提建议，帮助干部开展工作。
    三、为了鼓起每个社员的生产积极性、公社内各生产大队、小组和社员之间开展经常性的评比竞赛，评比模范集体、社会主义建设积极分子。同时，各生产队建立考勤簿、功过簿和等外劳动力出勤簿，专人逐日记载，作为评比和评发工资的依据。
    四、吸收老农和模范社员或有某项特长的农民参加公社内各级组织的生产、生活、财务、劳动等各方面的管理工作；并在田间、路旁、办公室、食堂等地到处设立大字报台，让社员们随时提出意见和建议。
