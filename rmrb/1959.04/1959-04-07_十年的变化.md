Ten Years of Change
		Xin Hua

The climate of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has undergone significant changes in the past decade. This change is: the once powerful American overlord has now lost its "prestige," and the "Atlantic solidarity" supported by the US dollar and American weapons is moving towards its opposite, replaced by increasingly acute internal contradictions.

When the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949, it was precisely when the United States was using the Marshall Plan "aid" to firmly control the weakened Western European countries in the post-war period. The representatives of the ruling groups in Western European countries who turned to the United States spared no effort to praise the Washington boss and the initiative to establish the Atlantic Group. British Foreign Secretary Bevin praised the North Atlantic Treaty as "the most remarkable historical undertaking," which opened up "a new era of cooperation and understanding." French Foreign Minister Schuman, a well-known pro-American politician, hailed the United States as an Atlantic leader backing Western European partners, saying that this was what Western Europe "had been hoping for but had not received in the two world wars." Morrison, who succeeded Bevin as British Foreign Secretary, even predicted during the Ottawa meeting of the Atlantic Group Council in September 1951: "The day will come when the people of the North Atlantic community will have a common nationality. All obstacles to thought, travel, trade, and mutual understanding will be eliminated."

In the early stages of the Atlantic Group, the Americans maintained a certain "prestige" in the minds of the Western European bourgeoisie. Before the establishment of the North Atlantic Military Headquarters at the end of 1950, bankers and industrialists in London and Paris waited for the arrival of Eisenhower, who was about to become the first commander-in-chief, like waiting for a savior, regarding him as the "savior of Europe." The January 8, 1951 issue of "Newsweek" wrote: "Eisenhower's appearance will be a dramatic moment. He showed the legendary qualities like Foch (the French Marshal in the First World War) not long ago. Now the newspapers are once again full of reports about his talent and wit in integrating people of different nationalities into one unit."

However, the vows of "unity" and "cooperation" and the "prestige" of the Washington overlord did not last long. It can be seen from the public opinion of the Atlantic countries that with the increasingly significant changes in the balance of power between peace and war in the international arena, the keynote of the Atlantic Group countries has become "division" and "chaos," and in recent years it has further developed into a loss of confidence in the United States and the Atlantic Group itself.

After the Soviet artificial satellite went into space in 1957, it shook the entire Western world. British Labour MP Crossman wrote at the time that Dulles' policy of "massive retaliation" and negotiating from a "position of strength" had finally collapsed. The idea of using Western "superiority" to force the Communists to accept Western conditions "has perished along with the Western countries' claim to be technologically superior to the backward Russians and Chinese." He pointed out that Eisenhower, as a symbol of American "superiority," "has become a shattered myth." The "French Observer" weekly wrote that Eisenhower's "reputation" "can no longer offset the bankruptcy of his government."

The West German "Die Welt" pointed out that it was a "big mistake" to think that relying on the Atlantic Group could "guarantee Western superiority." The French "International Forum" weekly said: "In strategic terms, American protection is no longer a sufficient guarantee, it can only subject France to an atomic counterattack from a possible opponent." The French "Aurore" said, "In the future, Europe will inevitably cover America. ... European countries must never again be placed in a state of retreat, or even not participate in major decisions."

The resulting "crisis of trust" in the United States' leadership in the Atlantic countries is deepening. In 1958, the United States' failure to play the "brink of war" policy in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait further discredited it, resulting in an unprecedented surge in anti-American and anti-US Secretary of State Dulles sentiment in Western European countries. In November 1958, a reporter from the British "Daily Telegraph" wrote that in the nine Western European countries he visited, including France, West Germany, and Italy, "not a single country voiced approval of Dulles." Western Europeans were very worried that they "were being held by Americans across an abyss, and these Americans were far from being reliable tightrope walkers." Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kennan wrote in October of the same year that the United States had become "the most hated country in the world."

Another aspect of Western Europe's "distrust" of the United States is the worry that the United States is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and will "sell out its friends" at critical moments. The "New York Times" published an article by Kissinger on March 12 this year, pointing out that in the current divergence of steps between the Atlantic countries on East-West relations and the Berlin issue, France and West Germany are both skeptical of the "firmness" and "reliability" of American policy, because with the "Soviet Union's manufacture of long-range missiles," Western Europe's "confidence in the "strength" and "will" of the United States has been greatly shaken."

Although Eisenhower boasted in his April 2 speech that the Atlantic Group is "an increasingly powerful and united political force," his "allies" painted a bleak picture. Atlantic Group Secretary-General Spaak said in an article published on April 1 that the real weakness of the group is the disunity of its fifteen member states. Former Deputy Supreme Commander of the Atlantic Group forces, British Marshal Montgomery, said in an article commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Atlantic Group that the group's two basic problems are disunity and lack of leadership. "Too many of us are allies in name only. We are a group of countries that cannot agree on how to achieve our goals."

This is the major change that the Atlantic Group faces ten years after its establishment.

    十年的变化
    辛桦
    北大西洋集团的气候在过去十年中发生了显著的变化。这个变化是：叱咤一时的美国盟主现在丧失了自己的“威望”，而依靠美元和美国武器支撑的“大西洋团结”正在走向它的反面，为内部日益尖锐的矛盾所代替。
    1949年大西洋公约签字的时候，正是美国利用马歇尔计划“援助”把战后虚弱不堪的西欧各国牢牢控制在自己手里的时候。投靠美国的西欧各国统治集团的代表们对华盛顿老板和建立大西洋集团的倡议极力歌功颂德。英国外交大臣贝文赞美北大西洋公约“是一件最卓著的历史性的事业”，它开辟了“一个合作和谅解的新时代”。法国的外交部长、著名的亲美政客舒曼欢呼美国充当大西洋盟主为西欧伙伴撑腰，他说这是西欧“在两次大战中一直盼望而没有盼到的事情”。继贝文之后担任英国外交大臣的莫里逊甚至在1951年9月大西洋集团理事会渥太华会议期间预言：“这样的一天终会到来，那时，北大西洋集团社会的各国人民有一个共同的国籍。所有思想上、旅行上、贸易上和彼此了解上的障碍都会消除掉。”
    在大西洋集团初期阶段里，美国人在西欧资产阶级心目中保持着某种“威望”。1950年底，北大西洋军事总部成立之前，伦敦和巴黎的银行家和工业家像等待救世主一样等待着行将担任第一任总司令的艾森豪威尔的到来，把他当作“欧洲的拯救者”。美国“新闻周刊”1951年1月8日的一期写道：“艾森豪威尔的出现将是一个戏剧性的时刻。他表现了像不久前福煦（第一次大战中的法国元帅）式的传奇般的品德。现在报纸上再一次充满了关于他善于把不同国籍的人们溶合成一个单位的才能和机智的报道。”
    但是“团结”“合作”的誓言和华盛顿盟主的“声威”并不久长。从大西洋各国舆论中可以看出：随着国际间和平与战争两种力量对比越来越显著的变化，大西洋集团国家的基调变成了“分裂”与“混乱”，近年来更进一步发展成为对美国和大西洋集团本身的信心的丧失。
    1957年苏联人造卫星上天以后震动了整个西方世界。英国工党议员克罗斯曼当时写道：杜勒斯的“大规模报复”和从“实力地位”谈判的政策已经最后垮台了。利用西方“优势”来迫使共产党人接受西方条件的这种想法“已经随着西方国家自称技术上优于落后的俄国人和中国人的说法同归于尽了”。他指出，作为美国“优势”的象征的艾森豪威尔“已经变成一个破灭了的神话”。“法兰西观察家”周刊写道，艾森豪威尔的“令誉”“再也不能抵消他的政府的破产”。
    西德“世界报”指出，认为依靠大西洋集团可以“保证西方优势”是“很大的错误”。法国“国际论坛”周刊说：“在战略方面美国的保护不再是足够的保障，它只能使法国遭到来自可能的对方的原子反击”。法国“震旦报”说，“今后，欧洲势将掩护美洲。……欧洲各国决不能再被置于退却状态，甚至不参与重大决定。”
    由此而产生的大西洋国家对美国领导的“信任危机”正在日益深刻化。1958年美国在中东和台湾海峡玩弄“战争边缘”政策失败而进一步声名扫地，结果西欧各国反对美国和美国国务卿杜勒斯的情绪空前高涨。1958年11月英国“每日电讯报”记者写道，在他访问过的法国、西德、意大利等九个西欧国家里，“没有一个国家发出赞成杜勒斯的声音”，西欧人非常担心自己“是被美国人抱着跨过无底深渊，而这些美国人却远不是可靠的走高空钢索的演员”。美国前驻苏大使凯南在同年10月间撰文指出，美国已经成为“世界上最受人憎恨的国家”。
    西欧对美国“不信任”的另一个方面是担心美国色厉内荏，在紧要关头会“出卖朋友”。“纽约时报”今年3月12日刊载基辛格的文章指出：在当前大西洋国家在东西方关系和柏林问题上步调的分歧中，法国和西德都在怀疑美国政策的“坚定”和“可靠性”，因为随着“苏联制成了远程导弹”，西欧对于美国的“力量”和“意志”所“抱有的信心已经大大动摇了”。
    尽管艾森豪威尔在今年4月2日演说中空口吹嘘大西洋集团是“日益强大的团结的政治力量”，但是他的“盟友”们却描绘了一幅阴暗的图景。大西洋集团秘书长斯巴克在4月1日发表的文章里说，这个集团的真正弱点是它的十五个成员国的不团结。前大西洋集团军队副总司令、英国元帅蒙哥马利在纪念大西洋集团十周年的文章中说，这个集团两个基本问题是一不团结、二缺乏领导。“我们之中太多的国家只是名义上的盟国。我们是一团不能就如何达到我们的目标取得一致意见的国家”。
    这就是大西洋集团在它成立十年之后所面对的重大变化。
