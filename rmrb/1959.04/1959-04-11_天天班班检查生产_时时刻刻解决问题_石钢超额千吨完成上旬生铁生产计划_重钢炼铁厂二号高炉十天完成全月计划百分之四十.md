　　Inspect Production Every Day, Every Shift, Solve Problems at All Times
　　Shijiazhuang Steel Exceeds Production Plan by One Thousand Tons
　　No. 2 Blast Furnace of Chongqing Steel Ironmaking Plant Completes Forty Percent of Monthly Plan in Ten Days
    (Reported by this newspaper) Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Company, which completed its first-quarter pig iron production plan ahead of schedule, achieved new and greater victories in the first ten days of the second quarter. It exceeded the ten-day plan by one thousand and forty-nine tons of pig iron, the qualified rate of pig iron reached over 99%, the average daily output increased by 10% compared with the same period last month, and the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace increased by 5%.
    Taking the improvement of the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace as the center, conscientiously improving the operation of the blast furnace, increasing the smelting intensity, organizing high-yield and high-quality red flag competitions, leading cadres personally directing production at the front line, and conducting inspections every day and every shift are the fundamental reasons why this company exceeded the ten-day pig iron production plan.
    Just entering April, the Party Committee of the Ironmaking Plant of this company handed over the plans for the second quarter and April, as well as the twenty-four key problems to complete this plan, to each work section, group, and worker for discussion. The broad masses of employees were determined to tackle these twenty-four keys, and each shift and group formulated action plans, quickly forming a mass upsurge to encircle and suppress the key issues. This enabled many key problems to be solved quickly, and the production of pig iron was refreshed daily.
    Increasing smelting intensity is an important key to rapidly increasing pig iron production. In the past, the workers of this company encountered difficulties in increasing the amount of charge in the blast furnace during the process of increasing smelting intensity. Therefore, a few technical cadres have long believed that large blast furnaces cannot increase smelting intensity. In late March, the company and the leading cadres of the Ironmaking Plant, workers, and engineering and technical personnel conducted research on the spot at the work sections and groups, and held multiple debates among the blast furnace operators. Finally, they decided to resolutely increase smelting intensity. After strengthening measures such as strengthening the probe holes in the furnace wall and diligently watching the tuyeres, and at the same time, the operators also strengthened the analysis and understanding of the furnace conditions, they finally eliminated the concerns that increasing smelting intensity might cause abnormal furnace conditions, and the production level of the blast furnace also increased with the smelting intensity. In the first ten days of April, the average daily increase was more than one hundred tons of pig iron.
    After the production level of pig iron increased, problems such as insufficient air volume occurred. The No. 1 tuyere of the No. 2 blast furnace is located above the tapping hole. In the past, they were afraid that the tapping hole would be difficult to maintain, so they did not dare to open it, which reduced the amount of air entering the blast furnace and affected the increase in output. The workers at the tapping hole repeatedly studied this key problem and adopted seven measures, such as strengthening the baking of the furnace door and changing the proportion of mud mixing, strengthened the maintenance of the furnace door, and opened the tuyere, so that the blast furnace blew in an additional two hundred cubic meters of air volume every day.
    During this ten-day period, the company established a production command, and leaders at all levels personally directed production at the front line, checking the production and implementation of major measures every day, and seizing the opportunity to solve problems. Red flag competitions for the same type of work were generally launched between the work sections and shifts of the Ironmaking Plant, and friendship competitions were also carried out with fraternal factories such as Taiyuan and Benxi, regularly exchanging technical information and plan completion information, encouraging and promoting each other, which played a great role in exceeding the plan for the first ten days of April.
    Now, the workers of this company are further carrying out red flag competitions for high yield, high quality, and high efficiency, and are striving to exceed the plan for April.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 10th: The Ironmaking Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled the plan for the first ten days of April. The No. 2 blast furnace, which was particularly outstanding in completing the task, exceeded the ten-day plan by 12.5%, which is equivalent to completing 40% of the entire monthly plan.
    Making every effort to increase the hot blast temperature of the hot blast stove is an important measure for this factory to complete the ten-day plan. Through the efforts of all the workers in the factory, the hot blast temperature of the hot blast stove quickly increased from 700 to 750 degrees in March to 800 to 850 degrees in the first ten days of April. This created favorable conditions for the whole factory to produce high-yield pig iron every day. At the beginning of April, the leaders of the factory put forward the slogan of "Support from all sides where there is a difficulty" and organized close cooperation and mutual support between various types of work, which played an important role in overfulfilling the ten-day plan. When the manganese ore could not be crushed in time, the workers in front of and behind the furnace, the hot blast stove, and the blower room all automatically adjusted their labor organization to provide support, ensuring the needs of ironmaking.

### 天天班班检查生产  时时刻刻解决问题　石钢超额千吨完成上旬生铁生产计划　重钢炼铁厂二号高炉十天完成全月计划百分之四十

　　天天班班检查生产  时时刻刻解决问题
　　石钢超额千吨完成上旬生铁生产计划
　　重钢炼铁厂二号高炉十天完成全月计划百分之四十
    本报讯　提前完成第一季度生铁生产计划的石景山钢铁公司，在第二季度的头十天里，又取得了新的更大的胜利。生铁超额一千零四十九吨完成了上旬计划，生铁合格率达到99％以上，平均日产量较上月同期提高10％，高炉利用系数提高了5％。
    以提高高炉的利用系数为中心，认真改进高炉操作，提高冶炼强度，组织高产优质的红旗竞赛，领导干部亲临前线指挥生产，天天、班班进行检查，是这个公司超额完成上旬生铁生产计划的根本原因。
    刚进入4月，这个公司炼铁厂的党委，就把第二季度和4月份的计划，以及完成这个计划的二十四个关键问题，交给每个工段、小组和工人进行讨论，广大职工决心包打这二十四个关键，班班、组组都制订了行动计划，很快就形成了群众性的围攻关键的热潮。使很多关键问题迅速得到了解决，出现了生铁产量日日翻新的局面。
    提高冶炼强度，是迅速提高生铁产量的重要关键。过去，这个公司的职工在提高冶炼强度的过程中，曾遇到高炉料增多的困难，因此，少数技术干部长期以来一直认为大型高炉不能提高冶炼强度。3月下旬，这个公司和炼铁厂的领导干部、工人和工程技术人员，到工段、小组的现场进行研究，在高炉操作人员之间展开多次辩论，最后决定坚决提高冶炼强度。经过加强炉墙探眼和勤看风口等项措施，同时操作人员也加强了对炉况的分析和了解，终于消除了提高冶炼强度可能造成炉况失常的顾虑，高炉的生产水平也随着冶炼强度而提高，4月上旬平均每天增产一百多吨生铁。
    生铁的生产水平提高以后，风量不足等问题发生了，二高炉的第一号风眼，位于出铁口上部，过去怕出铁口不好维护，因此不敢打开，这就减少了高炉的入炉风量，影响产量提高。出铁口的工人，反复研究了这个关键问题，采取了加强炉门烘烤、改变配泥比例等七项措施以后，加强了炉门的维护，打开了风眼，使高炉每天多吹进二百立方公尺风量。
    在这一旬里，这个公司成立了生产指挥部，各级领导干部都亲临前线指挥生产，每天检查生产和重大措施的实现情况，抓紧时机解决问题。炼铁厂各工段、班组之间，普遍展开了同工种红旗竞赛，并且和太原、本溪等兄弟厂开展了友谊竞赛，定期交换技术情报和计划完成情况，互相鼓励，互相促进，这对超额完成4月上旬计划，起了很大作用。
    现在，这个公司的职工，正在进一步开展高产优质高效率的红旗竞赛，为超额完成4月份的计划而努力。
    本报重庆10日电　重庆钢铁公司炼铁厂超额完成了4月上旬的计划。完成任务特别突出的二号高炉，产量超过了旬计划的12.5％，等于完成了全月计划的40％。
    全力提高热风炉的热风温度，是这个厂完成上旬计划的重要措施。经过全厂职工努力，热风炉的热风温度很快由3月份的七百度至七百五十度，提高到4月上旬的八百度到八百五十度。这就为全厂生铁天天高产创造了有利条件。4月份一开始，这个厂的领导就提出了“一处困难各处支援”的响亮口号，组织各工种之间密切配合，互相支援，对超额完成上旬计划起了重要作用。当锰矿来不及破碎时，炉前、炉后、热风炉、鼓风房的工人，都自动调整了劳动组织前来支援，保证了炼铁的需要。
