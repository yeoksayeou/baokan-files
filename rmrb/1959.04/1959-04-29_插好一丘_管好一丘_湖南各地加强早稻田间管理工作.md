Plant Well and Manage Well
Hunan Strengthens Field Management of Early Rice

(Our dispatch from Changsha, April 28th) After basically completing the transplanting of early rice, Hunan Province immediately adopted the method of "three-way combination" of leaders, technical cadres, and experienced farmers to go deep into the fields and inspect each plot, carrying out field management work such as supporting seedlings, replanting missing seedlings, and inter-tillage with topdressing, to promote the early recovery of early rice. According to incomplete statistics from the three regions of Chenxian County, Xiangtan, and Hengyang, more than 300,000 male and female commune members are carefully cultivating early rice every day. As of April 21st, these three regions had applied quick-acting fertilizer to more than 2.6 million mu of early rice fields, generally applying more than 10 dan of fertilizer per mu. More than 100,000 mu of early rice fields have completed the first round of inter-tillage and weeding. Now, most of the early rice planted earlier has recovered and is growing well.

This year, Hunan Province has more than 18 million mu of early rice, accounting for more than one-third of the province's rice planting area this year. And in the climate conditions of Hunan, the harvest of early rice is relatively stable and the yield is also higher. Therefore, striving for a bumper harvest of early rice is of great significance to ensuring the completion of the province's grain production increase plan this year. During the early rice transplanting, the Party committees at all levels, based on the characteristics that early rice was transplanted earlier this year and the early rice growing period is short, successively held forums for experienced farmers to seriously study how to strengthen the cultivation and management of early rice. Everyone believes that this year's early rice is generally transplanted seven or eight days earlier than last year, each mu has more than 10,000 more seedlings than last year, and the base fertilizer is also more than last year, which are extremely favorable conditions for increasing production. However, planting earlier, the seedlings are tender, and the field climate conditions have also changed with dense planting. Therefore, it is required that this year's field management work should be more meticulous, solid and in-depth. At present, supporting seedlings, replanting missing seedlings, and applying fertilizer according to the condition of the rice to promote the early recovery and effective tillering of early rice are important links in striving for a bumper harvest of early rice. Therefore, during the transplanting, the Party committees at all levels put forward the fighting slogan of "Plant well, manage well," requiring all localities to transplant, inspect, replant missing seedlings, apply topdressing fertilizer, and carry out inter-tillage at the same time, following up closely link by link. During the early rice transplanting in Chenxian County, more than 250,000 cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers were organized to conduct field inspections plot by plot. If any missing seedlings were found, they were immediately replanted; if yellow seedlings were found, fertilizer was immediately applied, and ash was applied at the base of the seedlings. At present, 72% of the county's more than 1.2 million mu of early rice has been replanted to ensure full stands, 73% of the early rice fields have been fertilized individually at the base of each seedling, and more than 270,000 mu of early rice fields have been topdressed with 12 dan of fertilizer per mu. Most of the early rice in the county quickly recovered and grew.

In order to strengthen the field management of early rice, many places are starting to establish a field management responsibility system, implementing the method of field management responsibility to individuals and rewarding overproduction. The enthusiasm of the commune members is even higher, and they are carrying out shallow irrigation, frequent irrigation, applying fertilizer according to the condition of the rice, pest control, and inter-tillage in the early rice fields in a timely manner, striving for a greater bumper harvest.

### 插好一丘　管好一丘  湖南各地加强早稻田间管理工作

    插好一丘　管好一丘
    湖南各地加强早稻田间管理工作
    本报长沙28日电　湖南省在基本结束早稻插秧工作之后，立即采取领导、技术干部和老农“三结合”的办法，深入田间，逐丘检查，开展扶苗补蔸，中耕追肥的田间管理工作，促使早稻早日回青。仅据郴县，湘潭、衡阳等三个专区不完全统计，现在每天出动三十多万名男女社员精心培育早稻。到4月21日止，这三个专区已在二百六十多万亩早稻田里追施了速效性肥料，一般每亩追肥十多担。还有十多万亩早稻田已完成了第一道中耕锄草工作。现在，栽插较早的早稻大部分已经回青，生长良好。
    今年湖南省有一千八百多万亩早稻，约占今年全省水稻种植面积的三分之一强。而早稻在湖南的气候条件下，收成比较稳定，产量也较高。因此争取早稻丰收，对保证今年全省粮食增产计划的完成，有很重大的意义，在早稻插秧中，各级党委根据今年早稻插得早和早稻生长期短的特点，就先后召开老农座谈会，认真研究如何加强早稻的培育管理工作。大家认为今年早稻一般较去年提早七、八天插秧、每亩又较去年增加一万多蔸本秧，基肥也较去年多，这是增产的极其有利的条件。但是，插得早，秧苗嫩，田间气候条件也随着密植发生了变化，因此要求今年的田间管理工作，要更加细致、扎实和深入。在目前，扶苗补蔸，看禾追肥、以促进早稻提前转青和有效分孽，是争取早稻丰收的重要环节。因此，在插秧中，各级党委就提出“插好一丘、管好一丘”的战斗口号，要求各地边插秧，边检查、边补蔸、边追肥中耕，一环一环地紧紧跟上去，郴县专区在早稻插秧中，组织二十五万多名干部、技术员和老农，逐丘逐块地进行田间检查，发现漏蔸，立即补插，发现黄苗，立即追肥、点安蔸灰。目前全区一百二十多万亩早稻已有72％进行了补蔸全苗工作，有73％的早稻田逐蔸逐蔸地点下了安蔸灰，还有二十七万多亩早稻田里每亩追肥十二担。全区大部分早稻很快回青成长。
    为了加强早稻的田间管理工作，许多地方正着手建立田间管理责任制，实行田间管理责任到人、超产奖励的办法，社员们的积极性更加高涨，及时地在早稻田里开展浅灌勤灌、看田追肥、除虫中耕等工作，争取更大丰收。　（胡坚）（附图片）
