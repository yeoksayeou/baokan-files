Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st - Regarding the world-renowned mystery of the Tunguska meteorite, Soviet scientists have proposed two new theories: one suggests that the damage in the Tunguska meteorite impact area was not caused by the impact and explosion of the meteorite on the ground, but by the shockwave formed during its flight; the other suggests that the Tunguska meteorite may have been a huge block of ice that evaporated during its descent.

On the morning of June 30, 1908, a huge meteorite fell near the Tunguska River in the great Siberian forest. It emitted a huge flash of light as it fell, visible within a radius of 800 kilometers in eastern Siberia. The loud crash was heard over a thousand kilometers away, and meteorological observatories in St. Petersburg and Britain recorded the airwaves from the meteorite's explosion at the time. Afterwards, bright "silver clouds" could be seen in the area every night, an odd phenomenon that lasted until August of the same year. For more than fifty years, scientists have conducted numerous expeditions and, apart from finding some very small fragments that may be from the meteorite, the fall of the Tunguska meteorite, estimated to weigh hundreds of thousands of tons, remains a striking mystery.

Recently, Rogionov, a staff member of the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, has offered a new explanation for the damage caused by this meteorite.

He said that the damage in the Tunguska meteorite impact area may not have been caused by the explosion after the meteorite impacted the ground, but by the shockwave formed by the meteorite during its flight. Scientists used theoretical calculation methods to derive the above argument: If the diameter of the meteorite is 30 to 100 meters, and the speed of the fall is 10 to 50 kilometers per second, the effect it has on the earth's surface is equivalent to the effect caused by the explosion of 10 million tons of high explosives, and it will inevitably cause a volcanic crater-shaped pit 200 meters deep and 1 kilometer in diameter on the ground. However, no such pit has been found in the area where the Tunguska meteorite fell. According to aerial photographs of the forest, which was previously thought to be damaged by the meteorite, there is axial symmetry, indicating that the forest damage was not caused by an explosion, but by a shockwave.

Therefore, Rogionov suggested that the Tunguska meteorite should be sought to the northwest far from the so-called explosion zone. Currently, only this direction has not been searched.

In addition, Krinov, the academic secretary of the Meteorite Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, expressed doubt as to whether the meteorite fragments found in the past are indeed fragments of the Tunguska meteorite. He put forward another hypothesis, saying that the Tunguska meteorite may have been a huge block of ice that evaporated during its descent.

    “通古斯陨石之谜”新解
    一说是陨石下落时形成冲击波而造成破坏
    一说是它可能是一个降落时蒸发了的冰块
    新华社莫斯科21日电　关于世界闻名的通古斯陨石之谜，苏联科学家又提出了两种新论点：一种是认为通古斯陨石坠落地区的损坏现象不是因为陨石和地面撞击、爆炸引起，而是由于它在飞行中形成的冲击波所造成的；一种认为，通古斯陨石可能是一块在降落中蒸发了的巨大冰块。
    1908年6月30日的清晨，在西伯利亚大森林，通古斯河附近坠落了一块巨大的陨石，它在坠落时发出了巨大的火光，东西伯利亚方圆八百公里以内都可看到。坠落时发出的巨响传到一千公里之外，彼得堡和英国的一些气象台当时都纪录到了陨石爆炸时的气浪。此后，这个地区每在夜间就可看到明亮的“银云”，这种奇异的现象一直保持到同年8月。五十多年来，科学家们进行了多次的考察，除了找到了一些可能是这块陨石的极微小的碎片外，关于这块据估计有几十万吨重的通古斯陨石的下落，至今还是一个引人注目的谜。
    最近，苏联科学院化学物理研究所的工作人员罗吉昂诺夫对这块陨石所造成的损坏痕迹提出了新的解释。
    他说，通古斯陨石坠落地区的损坏现象可能不是因为陨石和地面撞击后的爆炸引起的，而是由于陨石在飞行中形成的冲击波所造成的。科学家们运用理论计算的方法得出了以上的论点，如果陨石的直径是三十到一百公尺，殒落时的速度为每秒十至五十公里，它对地球表面所引起的效果相当于一千万吨烈性炸药爆炸后所引起的效果，而且必然会使地面造成一个两百公尺深、直径一公里的火山喷口形的大坑。但是，在通古斯陨石降落的地区并没有发现类似的坑。根据这个过去被认为是陨石所损毁的森林的空中照片，发现有轴对称现象，说明森林的损坏不是因为爆炸，而是冲击波形成的。
    因此，罗吉昂诺夫提出，应当到所谓爆炸形成区的西北远方去寻找通古斯陨石，目前，只有这个方向还没有寻找过。
    此外，苏联科学院陨石委员会学术秘书克里诺夫，对过去所找到的陨石碎片是否就是通古斯陨石的碎片，提出了怀疑。他提出了另一种设想，他说，通古斯陨石可能是一块在降落中蒸发了的巨大的冰块。
