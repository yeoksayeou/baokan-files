    Sent to Relatives in Lhasa
    Yu Shifeng
    Pressed by labor, songs never end.
    Meeting on festivals, dances never cease.
    Three thousand years of joy amidst hardship,
    Who lives more stubbornly than you!
    Green walls, red pillars, a haven for birds.
    Carpets, aprons, a garden of flowers.
    Floral shoes, floral hats, floral clothes,
    Who loves colorful life more than you!
    Sweat nurtures the land of the valley,
    Carrying big trees as bridges, stones as roads.
    Who works harder than you
    —transforming your homeland into a happy paradise!
    Chairman Mao's kindness, the People's Liberation Army's songs,
    The sun scatters the plateau's clouds and mist.
    Men, women, old, and young meet and sing, Lhasa is so joyous!
    Who understands the joy of liberation more profoundly than you!
    The warm rays of the sun,
    Obstructed by the yellow robes of reactionary upper classes.
    The song of liberation, blocked by the high walls of reactionaries.
    Who has accumulated more the anger of three thousand years of slavery than you!
    Now, the haze is swept away,
    The People's Liberation Army has thoroughly eliminated the millennia of dross in Lhasa,
    The city is filled with blessings of "Tashi Delek"!
    Who more rapidly
    Steps from feudal society onto the socialist road!
    Relatives!
    Please use the colorful pens of your bamboo slips,
    To write the history of building a new Tibet.
    Please use your diligent hands,
    To pave the road to building a new Tibet.
    Let the banks of the Lhasa River be evergreen!
    Let the mountains and forests of Lhasa be verdant!
    Let the relatives of Lhasa sing forever—the socialist march!
    Let the relatives of Lhasa dance forever—the footsteps of socialism!
    Let the multicolored Lhasa,
    Forever become, on the border of the motherland,
    A joyous peacock!

    寄给拉萨的亲人
    喻石风
    劳役压着，唱不完的歌。
    节日相逢，跳不完的舞。
    三千年来苦中乐，
    谁有你们更倔强地活着！
    绿壁、红柱，百鸟的归宿。
    毛毯、围裙，百花的园圃。
    花鞋、花帽、花衣服，
    谁有你们更热爱彩色的生活！
    汗孕育河谷的土地，
    扛大树当桥，背石板当路。
    谁有你们更努力地工作
    ——变故乡为幸福的乐土！
    毛主席的恩情解放军的歌，
    太阳散尽了高原的云雾。
    男女老少相见歌，拉萨好快活！
    谁有你们理解得深刻解放的欢乐！
    太阳温暖的光芒，
    被上层反动派的黄袍遮住。
    解放的歌声，被反动派的高墙堵隔。
    谁有你们郁积得更多三千年奴隶的愤怒！
    如今，阴霾扫尽了，
    解放军彻底扫除了拉萨千年的渣滓，
    市区充满了“吉祥如意”的祝福！
    谁有你们更迅速
    从封建社会跨上社会主义的大路！
    亲人啊！
    请用你们竹签的彩笔，
    写下建设新西藏的史书。
    请用你们勤劳的双手，
    铺平建设新西藏的道路。
    让拉萨河畔长青！
    让拉萨山林长绿！
    让拉萨亲人长歌——社会主义进行曲！
    让拉萨亲人长舞——社会主义进行脚步！
    让五光十彩的拉萨啊，
    永远成为祖国边疆的
    一只欢乐的孔雀！
