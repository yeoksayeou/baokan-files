Qinghai Province is rich in wildlife resources. In the dense forests of the Qinghai Plateau, a large number of rare birds and animals appear every year. These animals are mainly distributed around Qinghai Lake and in the vast fields of the Qilian Mountains, Kunlun Mountains, and the upper reaches of the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, producing abundant deer, musk, otters, leopards, snow leopards, brown bears, red jade, swans, wild yaks, wild horses, blue-eared pheasant, roe deer, argali, willow ptarmigan, and other rare birds and animals. Single-humped camels have also been found on the Tanggula Mountains at an altitude of over 5,000 meters. These rare birds and animals are mostly rare in China. Their furs enjoy a great reputation in the international market.

The wildlife in Qinghai Province is widely distributed and abundant. The Qilian Mountains in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the Majixueshan Mountains in Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Nangqian and Qumalai in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are the main deer-producing areas, where dozens or hundreds of them often live in the deep mountains in groups. Male deer have horns, containing blood, which is deer antler, an extremely valuable medicinal material. Deer meat is delicious and nutritious, and deer skin is tough, smooth, and soft, suitable for making high-quality leather shoes. Swans are produced in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the southwest of Qinghai Lake. Their characteristics are large size, abundant meat, large and delicious eggs, and the feathers can be spun into wool. The fur can be used as a noble clothing decoration after dyeing. In the Qilian Mountains, there is a relatively rare snow leopard, which lives in caves in high mountains and snowfields. It is said that its tail is five feet long and two inches in diameter, with thirty-six tailbones. With just one flick of its tail, it can kill any bird or animal next to it. There is also a wild yak, with a weight of up to 1,000 catties for a large one. After being killed, it takes five yaks to carry it.

Qinghai Province is truly rich in wildlife resources. People traveling by car or horseback on the road can see groups of deer, wild donkeys, and argali galloping by at any time. According to current preliminary investigations, there are dozens of species of wild animals in Qinghai Province, among which the more precious ones include snow leopards, lynx, antelopes, swans, brown bears, and wild donkeys. The Qinghai Animal Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to basically clarify the distribution and species of wild animals in Qinghai Province this year for scientific research purposes.

Qinghai Province has vast grasslands, lakes, and reed marshes, with lush aquatic plants, making it a natural zoo. In order to tap the wealth of forest areas and breed precious wild animals, many breeding farms have been established in various places. Yushu, Huangnan, and Haixi Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures, and the Qaidam Basin are raising animals such as red deer, roe deer, bar-headed geese, wild ducks, argali, and red wolves in breeding farms. The duck farm in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has successfully hatched bar-headed geese using artificial incubation and bred young bar-headed geese.

　　青海水草富珍禽异兽多
    青海省野生动物资源丰富。在青海高原的丛山密林里，每年都有大量的珍禽异兽出没其间。这些禽兽主要分布在青海湖周围以及祁连山、昆仑山、黄河、长江上游的广阔原野上，盛产鹿、麝香、水獭、金钱豹、雪豹、瞎熊、红玉、天鹅、野牛、野马、马鸡、獐、石羊、柳鸡等等珍禽异兽。在海拔五千多公尺的唐古拉山上还发现有单峰骆驼。这些珍禽异兽在国内大多很少见。它们的皮毛在国际市场上享有很大声誉。
    青海省的野生动物分布广，产量多。海北藏族自治州的祁连山区、果洛藏族自治州的马积雪山和玉树藏族自治州的囊谦、曲麻莱等地区是鹿的主要产地，时常数十只或数百只成群结队居住在深山中。雄鹿多角，内含血液，即鹿茸，是一种极其珍贵的药材。鹿肉味美可口，富有养分，鹿皮坚韧光滑而柔软，可制特等皮鞋。天鹅产于玉树藏族自治州和青海湖西南地区，它的特点是体大肉多，蛋大味美，毛可纺织呢绒，毛皮经过染色后可作高贵的衣著装饰品。在祁连山中有一种比较罕见的雪豹，穴居高山雪地，据说尾巴有五尺长，直径两寸粗，尾骨有三十六节，只要一甩尾巴就可以打死在它身旁的任何禽兽。还有一种野牛，大者一头体重达一千斤。打死后需要用五个牦牛才能驮动。
    青海省的野生动物资源实在丰富，人们坐汽车或骑马在路上行驶，随时随地都可以看到成群的鹿、野驴、石羊等动物奔驰而过。仅据现在的初步调查，青海省的野生动物就有数十种，其中比较珍贵的有雪豹、猞猁、羚羊、天鹅、马熊、野驴等。中国科学院青海动物站决定在今年内把青海省野生动物的分布状况和品种基本上调查清楚，以备科学研究之用。
    青海省有着广大的草原、湖泊和苇塘，水草丰美，是一座天然的动物园。为了挖掘林区财富、繁殖珍贵野生动物，各地兴办了不少的饲养场。玉树、黄南、海西等藏族自治州和柴达木盆地正在饲养场中饲养着马鹿、活獐、班雁、野鸭、石羊和红狼等动物。玉树藏族自治州的养鸭场已将班雁用人工孵卵成功，并繁殖出幼班雁。
