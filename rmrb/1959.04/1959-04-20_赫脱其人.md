Introducing a personality:

　　Who is Herter?
    On April 18th, U.S. President Eisenhower announced that Christian Archibald Herter would succeed Dulles as Secretary of State.

    Since Dulles took leave of absence on February 9th due to cancer, Herter, the then-Undersecretary of State, has been acting as Secretary of State. Herter was born in 1895. After graduating from Harvard University in 1915, he joined the diplomatic service. From 1916 to 1918, he served successively as an attaché at the American embassies in Germany and Belgium, Chargé d'Affaires in Belgium, and Special Assistant to the U.S. State Department. After World War I, he served as secretary of the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and assisted former President Hoover in "relief" work in Europe. From 1919 to 1924, he was an assistant to Hoover (then Secretary of Commerce). From 1920 to 1921, he also served as the executive secretary of the "European Relief Committee" organized by Hoover.

    For the twelve years after 1931, Herter was continuously elected as a member of the Massachusetts State Legislature, serving as Speaker from 1939 to 1943. From 1939 to 1941, he was the Chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party. From 1943, he was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for the 78th to 82nd Congresses, serving as Vice Chairman of the "Special Committee for European Aid" in the House. From 1953, he served as Governor of Massachusetts. In January 1957, he was nominated as Undersecretary of State.

    Herter is an important figure in the American Republican Party, belonging to a faction within the party that represents the interests of the northeastern financial groups, and has close ties with the Rockefeller financial group. He is an active supporter of Eisenhower. He has always advocated aggressive policies of foreign "aid" and expansion, and actively supported the Marshall Plan. In 1947, he led a delegation from the House of Representatives to 18 European countries for inspection. After returning to the United States, he submitted a report strongly advocating "aid" to Western Europe, Turkey, and Greece, and supported the "Common Trade Law." In August 1957, Herter and Richards, as personal representatives of Eisenhower, carried out activities in Malaya, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and South Vietnam. He also put forward the idea of so-called "cultural diplomacy" to carry out cultural aggression. He actively planned the "Cold War" policy, opposed peaceful coexistence, and repeatedly clamored for expanding aggression against China. Recently, at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, he clamored that the United States should use all its aircraft and missiles to "defend" its allies, advocated a "firm attitude" on the Berlin issue, and maintain military forces for conducting "limited wars."
