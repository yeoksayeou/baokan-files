    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, denounced by the people of the world as the "Black Pact" group, is the main tool of aggression of the imperialist camp under the control of the United States. It has consistently engaged in aggressive and anti-people activities.
    The United States first encouraged Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to sign the "Western European Union" treaty in March 1948, and then, on the basis of the "Western European Union," gathered twelve countries including Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Norway, and Portugal, and formally signed the North Atlantic Treaty on April 4, 1949. In February 1952, the United States dragged Turkey and Greece, which are not in the Atlantic region, into this group. In May 1955, West Germany also joined the organization, bringing the total to fifteen countries.
    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council is the highest authority of this group, holding meetings two to three times a year. The foreign ministers, defense ministers, and finance ministers of each member state participate, and sometimes the prime ministers also participate. When the Council is not in session, a body called the Council of Permanent Representatives handles daily affairs.
    Under the Council, there is a Military Committee composed of the chiefs of staff of the member states, which is the highest military body of the organization. Its permanent executive body is called the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee can be said to be the nerve center of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It can make major military decisions and is responsible for studying general strategic issues. Attached to it are seven special military agencies and three commands: the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), the Atlantic Naval Command, and the Channel Command. Among them, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe is the main force, and it is divided into four commands: the Mediterranean, Southern Europe, Northern Europe, and Central Europe. These four commands are further divided into seventeen command posts. This set of military institutions is extremely large. Even Field Marshal Montgomery, the former Deputy Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, admitted that it is a "complex, cumbersome, and overstaffed" organization. The position of the so-called Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe has been held by Americans from the beginning to the present. The first was Eisenhower, and the current one is Norstad. The offices of the Military Committee and the Standing Committee are located in the Pentagon of the U.S. Department of Defense in Washington. Norstad openly said that this allows representatives of various countries to be "close to the U.S. Department of Defense."
    From the time this group was established, the United States has forced its member states to expand their armies, prepare for war, and deploy aggressive activities. The military expenditure of the member states of this group has reached 500 billion U.S. dollars in the past ten years. In the past year, the United States has been exerting pressure to rapidly increase the ground forces of this group from the existing twenty-one divisions to a "minimum" of thirty divisions, at least half of which possess atomic weapons. The United States has also used the North Atlantic Group to establish hundreds of military bases, deploying atomic weapons on these bases in an attempt to encircle the Soviet Union. In the aggressive plans of the United States, establishing an aggressive force with the West German army as the backbone has always been its central issue. It instructed West Germany to announce that it would establish twelve army divisions by the end of 1959, and proposed that the army personnel would reach 200,000 by April 1, 1961.
    The United States also uses the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a tool for it to control and enslave Western European countries. Through its military and political control over the North Atlantic Group, it puts the armies, air defense, bases, transportation lines, and resources of the member states under its own control. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. military personnel stationed in member states enjoy extraterritorial rights, wantonly ravaging the sovereignty of various countries and acting recklessly. The United States also uses this aggressive group to support colonialist countries and suppress the magnificent national independence movement.
    However, the result of the United States dragging its allies down the road of the arms race has further deepened the economic and political crisis of Western European countries, making it face many difficulties in implementing its aggressive plans. The North Atlantic Group meeting in December 1950 once adopted the U.S.-drafted military expansion plan, stipulating the establishment of one hundred divisions by 1954. This military building target has been repeatedly reduced, and it has failed to be completed time and time again. With the development of economic and political crises, and under the general situation that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, the internal contradictions and infighting within the North Atlantic Group have further intensified. Recently, France's announcement that its Mediterranean fleet will no longer be under the jurisdiction of the North Atlantic Group is one of the signs of the development of contradictions.

### “黑约”集团——北大西洋公约组织

    “黑约”集团——北大西洋公约组织
    被世界人民斥之为“黑约”集团的北大西洋公约组织是美国控制下的帝国主义阵营的主要侵略工具。它一贯进行着侵略性活动和反人民的活动。
    美国先在1948年3月鼓励英、法、荷、比、卢签订了“西欧联盟”条约，然后在“西欧联盟”的基础上，纠集加、丹、冰、意、挪、葡等共十二个国家，在1949年4月4日正式签订了北大西洋公约。1952年2月，美国又把非大西洋地区的土耳其和希腊拉进了这个集团，1955年5月西德也参加了这个组织，凑成了十五个国家。
    北大西洋公约组织理事会是这个集团的最高权力机构，每年要举行二至三次会议。由各缔约国的外交部长、国防部长和财政部长参加，有时总理也参加。理事会休会时由叫作常任代表理事会的机构来处理日常事务。
    理事会下设有由各成员国参谋总长组成的军事委员会，这是这个组织的最高军事机构。它的常设执行机构叫作常设委员会。常设委员会可说是北大西洋公约组织的神经中枢，它可以采取重大的军事决定，并负责研究一般的战略问题。它的下面附有七个特别军事机构和三个司令部——北大西洋公约组织欧洲盟军最高司令部，大西洋海军司令部，海峡司令部。其中的欧洲盟军最高司令部是主要力量，它的下面分设地中海、南欧、北欧、中欧四个司令部。这四个司令部下又设有十七个指挥部。这一套军事机构，极为庞大，连前任北大西洋公约组织欧洲盟军最高副统帅的英国元帅蒙哥马利也承认它是一个“庞杂的、笨重的、充满冗员的”机构。所谓欧洲盟军最高司令的位置从开始至今都是由美国人担任，第一任是艾森豪威尔，现任是诺斯塔德。军事委员会和常设委员会的办公处都设在华盛顿美国国防部的五角大楼内。诺斯塔德公开说，这样能使各国代表“接近美国国防部”。
    从这个集团成立的时候起，美国就迫使各成员国扩军备战，部署侵略活动。这集团的成员国十年以来军事开支已达到五千亿美元。去年来，美国一直施加压力，要求将这集团的地面部队从现有的二十一个师迅速增加到“最低限度”的三十个师，其中至少有一半是拥有原子武器。美国还利用北大西洋集团建立了成百的军事基地，在这些基地上配置原子武器，妄图包围苏联。在美国的侵略计划中，建立一支以西德军队为骨干的侵略部队一直是它的中心课题。它指使西德宣布到1959年年底要建立十二个陆军师，并提出到1961年4月1日陆军兵员将达到二十万人。
    美国还利用北大西洋公约组织作为它控制和奴役西欧国家的工具。它通过对北大西洋集团的军事、政治的控制权，把各成员国的军队、空防、基地、交通线和资源置于自己的控制之下。美国驻在各成员国的数十万军事人员，享有治外法权，肆行蹂躏各国主权，横行无忌。美国并通过这个侵略集团，支持殖民主义国家，镇压波澜壮阔的民族独立运动。
    但是，美国拖着它的盟国在军备竞赛道路上前进的结果，进一步加深了西欧国家的经济和政治危机，使它在推行它的侵略计划时，困难重重。1950年12月北大西洋集团会议曾经通过美国拟订的扩军计划，规定到1954年建立一百个师。这个建军指标一再缩减，一次又一次地不能完成。随着经济和政治危机的发展，在东风压倒西风的总形势下，北大西洋集团内部的矛盾和倾轧进一步加剧。最近法国宣布它的地中海舰队不再受北大西洋集团的管辖，就是矛盾发展的标志之一。
