Comrades Chairman, Fellow Members:

    I fully agree with the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou and the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan, and express my warm support.

    Encouraged by the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, the teachers and students of our Central China Agricultural College went down to the people's communes in Yingcheng, Tianmen and other counties from December 1958 to participate in labor and live with the commune members. Through several months of labor training, all the teachers and students of the college established deep feelings with the peasants, loved the countryside, loved production, and loved labor, and their ideological awareness was greatly improved. Under the conditions of living and working together with the peasants, they learned many valuable production experiences from the peasants, and their professional knowledge was also greatly improved. Therefore, the teachers and students unanimously believe that going to the countryside and participating in labor training has achieved a double harvest in ideology and professional skills. During the period of going to the countryside, in order to learn from the major achievements made by the peasants in horticultural production during the Great Leap Forward in 1958 to enrich our teaching content, I and two students went to the people's communes in the suburbs of Wuhan, Huanggang Special Zone, and Jingzhou Special Zone for more than two months of vegetable high-yield investigation. In the areas we experienced, we saw bumper crops and bumper vegetables. We saw the establishment of factories, the accumulation of fertilizer, the making of fertilizer, and we also saw the newly established residential areas. Everywhere was filled with the achievements of the Great Leap Forward and joyful poems, and the face of the countryside was completely new. All of this has greatly inspired and improved our ideological understanding and professional knowledge. What excites me most is the tremendous role played by the establishment of people's communes in promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

    As Premier Zhou pointed out in the Government Work Report: "In the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Chinese people made a great creation in social organization, which is the people's communes established in the rural areas throughout the country according to the demands of the vast number of peasants. ... Under China's conditions, it is not only the best form for promoting the continued development of productive forces and accelerating socialist construction, but also the best form for the future transition from socialist collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and from socialist society to communist society in the rural areas throughout the country." I would like to talk about my humble experiences regarding the superior conditions manifested by the establishment of people's communes in implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production increase.

    The first is the rational utilization of land and the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. After the realization of people's communes, peasants have implemented deep plowing and land leveling in cultivation, and implemented "ditch and compartment" reforms. Fruit trees are cultivated using slopes and highlands. Ponds and lowlands are used for fish farming and the development of aquatic vegetables. Under the circumstances of adapting to local conditions and making the most of the land, it not only creates conditions for the development of diversified operations, but also provides convenient conditions for cultivation management and the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests.

    Implementing rational crop rotation is a basic measure to prevent diseases. Farmers deeply know the disadvantages of many crops being "repeatedly cultivated on the same land" and the advantages of "changing land." However, it is relatively difficult to implement a rational crop rotation system when the cultivated land area is not large enough. Especially in vegetable cooperatives in urban suburbs, because there are many varieties of vegetables and many replanting times, it is even more difficult to implement rational vegetable rotation when the land area is not large enough. For example, Tongxing and Qunjin vegetable cooperatives in Heping Township in the suburbs of Wuhan are old areas for vegetable cultivation. In the past, due to the small land area and the difficulty of rotation, several major diseases of the main vegetables were caused by many years of continuous cropping, which had a considerable impact on increasing production. Since the establishment of the people's commune, they have had the conditions to solve this major difficulty.

    In the areas we have experienced, we have seen that the arrangement of crops is in zones and in pieces, and we no longer see small pieces of management. Under the favorable conditions of zonal and segmental crops, implementing rational crop rotation, eliminating field ridges and wasteland, and clearing weeds, it is not only possible to prevent the occurrence of diseases and insect pests, but also to concentrate on eliminating them in the event of occurrence. Moreover, the implementation of the crop rotation system also plays a major role in improving the soil structure and making the soil fertility fully and effectively utilized, which is also important for increasing production.

    The second is the issue of water conservancy and irrigation. Rational drainage and irrigation is one of the important conditions for increasing agricultural production. Hubei has more rain in spring and summer and drought in autumn, and a rational drainage and irrigation method is very important in cultivation, but it was also difficult to implement a rational drainage and irrigation system before the establishment of people's communes. For example, vegetable production in the suburbs of Wuhan was still irrigated by manual water carrying in the early days of liberation. After 1954, the suburban government demonstrated water diversion and irrigation, but in the past, due to the small size and weak strength of the cooperatives, this rational technological reform failed to be promoted for a long time. Therefore, vegetable production in the suburbs could not completely get rid of the impact of the autumn drought. Great restrictions have been placed on expanding the sown area and increasing the yield per unit area, so that vegetable production in the suburbs cannot keep up with the growing needs of the urban people. After the establishment of the suburban people's commune in the autumn of 1958, due to the large size and strength of the commune, water diversion and irrigation was implemented throughout the suburbs in a short period of time. In the autumn of 1958, the vegetable sowing area in the suburbs of Wuhan expanded by about 35,000 mu. Under the call of running iron and steel in a big way, suburban peasants also drew a considerable number of laborers to participate in steelmaking and ironmaking. Because the vegetable irrigation method was changed from manual water carrying to ditch diversion and gravity irrigation, more than ten times the labor force can be saved, so that vegetable production in the suburbs of Wuhan in the autumn of 1958 was not only not affected by the autumn drought due to the reduction of labor force and reduced production, but also greatly increased the yield per unit area because the improved irrigation method guaranteed the sufficient moisture needed for vegetable growth. For example, the main vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and radish generally achieved a large-scale high yield of 15,000 to 20,000 jin per mu on average, an increase of more than double compared with 1957. Therefore, Wuhan suburbs not only did not feel that the supply of vegetables was insufficient due to the increase in urban population in 1958, but also strongly supported the needs of fraternal cities. Therefore, the peasants said that the leap forward in vegetable production this year was the result of the improvement of irrigation conditions after the establishment of the people's commune.

    The third is the issue of breeding improved varieties. The diversification of varieties is a characteristic of vegetable production in urban suburbs. However, this has also brought great difficulties to the breeding of improved vegetable varieties. Because most vegetables are cross-pollinated plants, the more varieties there are, the greater the degree of mixing. For example, Changfeng Township is the main radish producing area in the suburbs of Wuhan. Each cooperative owns ten or so varieties. No matter how hard you try in a small area of less than two miles, it is inevitable that there will be a considerable degree of mixing. As a result of mixing, not only the quality of the products is reduced, but also the loss of early bolting is caused. The same is true for Chinese cabbage, cabbage, lettuce, etc., so suburban farmers have found it very difficult to breed improved varieties in the past. When we went to Changfeng Township for investigation in the winter of 1958, the peasants happily told us: "We now keep one variety in each production area, and we will select and breed superior varieties every year to improve the quality of the seeds. You don't have to worry about our varieties being mixed anymore." Other communes have solved the problem in this way in terms of seed retention methods. The problems that have existed in production for a long time have been solved smoothly after communization. The establishment of improved variety breeding bases for field crops must also rely on the superior conditions of the commune to be perfectly solved.

    Then let's talk about the issue of agricultural mechanization. In order to adapt to and promote the development of agricultural production, tool reform and agricultural mechanization occupy an extremely important position. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "The fundamental way to solve the shortage of rural labor is to increase agricultural labor productivity, to gradually realize technological innovation and technological revolution, and to gradually realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural tools." On this issue, I used to have serious conservative ideas, thinking that China has a vast land area and a weak original industrial base, and it is not easy to realize mechanization in the vast rural areas. After going to the countryside this time, I saw that every commune has its own farm tool repair and assembly factory or farm tool manufacturing factory. Especially the impressions after arriving in Jingmen made me suddenly enlightened. - The realization of agricultural machinery in our country will move forward along the road of people's communes. Jingmen used to be a deserted and poor mountainous area, but now it has become a booming cooperative iron and steel base for Tianmen, Mianyang and Qianjiang counties. It will provide rich material conditions for the agricultural mechanization of the four counties. Such situations are everywhere in the country. Therefore, the realization of agricultural mechanization in our country will not be a distant future, but will definitely be realized in a relatively short period of a few years.

    In short, the important measures of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production increase have been implemented under more favorable conditions after the realization of people's communes, and will be further enriched, pushing the production of agriculture in our country to a faster and higher development.

### 人民公社为贯彻农业“八字宪法”提供了优越条件  杨惠安委员的发言

    人民公社为贯彻农业“八字宪法”提供了优越条件
    杨惠安委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意周总理所作的政府工作报告、李维汉副主席所作的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，并表示热忱拥护。
    在一九五八年农业生产大跃进形势的鼓舞下，我们华中农学院的师生于一九五八年十二月起，下放到应城、天门等县的人民公社，参加劳动，同社员们在一起生活。全院师生通过了几个月的劳动锻炼，和农民建立了深厚的感情，热爱乡村，热爱生产，热爱劳动，在思想觉悟上都有了很大的提高。在同农民共同生活、共同劳动的条件下，从农民学习了很多宝贵的生产经验，在业务知识上也得到了很大的提高。所以师生们一致认为，下放农村，劳动锻炼，达到了思想业务的双丰收。在下放期间，为了学习农民在一九五八年大跃进中在园艺生产方面所取得的重大成就，来充实我们的教学内容，我和两个学生曾到武汉郊区，黄岗专区，荆州专区各县的人民公社，进行了为时两个多月的蔬菜丰产调查。在我们所经历的地区，看到了丰收的农作物，丰收的蔬菜。看到了兴办工厂，积肥、造肥，也看到了新建立起的居民点。到处都充满了大跃进的成绩和欢乐的诗歌，农村的面貌焕然一新。所有一切，对于我们的思想认识和业务知识都有很大的启发和提高。最令我感到兴奋的是人民公社的成立对推动工农业生产发展所发生的巨大作用。
    正如周总理在政府工作报告中所指出：“在一九五八年的大跃进中，我国人民在社会组织方面有了一个伟大的创造，这就是全国农村中根据广大农民的要求而建立的人民公社。……在我国条件下，它不仅是推动生产力继续向前发展，加速社会主义建设的最好形式，而且是将来全国农村从社会主义集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，从社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好形式。”我想就人民公社成立后，在贯彻执行农业增产“八字宪法”所显现的优越条件来谈谈我的点滴体会。
    首先是土地的合理利用和病虫的防治。在人民公社化实现后，农民在耕作上都实行了土壤的深耕和土地的平整，并实行了“沟厢”改革。利用坡地高地，栽培果树。利用池塘低地，养鱼和发展了水生蔬菜。在因地制宜，地尽其利的情况下，不仅对于发展多种经营，创造了条件，而且在耕作管理以及病虫的防治上，更提供了便利的条件。
    实行合理轮作是预防病害的基本措施。农民深深知道许多作物“重地”的坏处和“换地”的好处。但在耕地面积不够广大的情况下，要实行合理的轮作制是比较困难的。特别是在城市郊区的蔬菜社，由于蔬菜的品种多，复种次数多，在土地面积不够广大时，实行蔬菜的合理轮作，更感困难。例如在武汉郊区和平乡原同兴、群进等蔬菜社是栽培蔬菜的老区，过去由于土地面积小，轮作困难。在多年连作的情况下，引起了几种主要蔬菜的重要病害，使增产受到了相当大的影响，自人民公社成立后，它们就有条件地解决了这一重大的困难问题。
    在我们所经历的地区，看到作物的安排都是分区成片，不复见到小块经管了。在作物的分区成片，实行合理轮作，消灭田埂荒地，清除杂草的有利条件下，不仅可以预防病虫的发生，即在发生的情况下，也利于集中消灭。而且轮作制的实行，对于改善土壤的结构，以及使土壤的肥力达到充分地有效利用，对增产也起着重大的作用。
    其次是水利灌溉问题。合理的排灌是农业增产的重要条件之一。湖北春夏多雨，秋季干旱，在耕作上的合理排灌方式非常重要，但在人民公社化前，实行合理的排灌制度也感到困难，例如在武汉郊区的蔬菜生产在解放初期还是用人工挑水灌溉。在一九五四年后郊区政府曾示范引水灌溉，但过去由于社小力量小，这一合理的技术改革，长时期未能推广。因而郊区的蔬菜生产不能完全摆脱秋旱的影响。在扩大播种面积和提高单位面积的产量上受到了很大的限制，致使郊区的蔬菜生产赶不上城市人民日益增长的需要。在一九五八年秋季郊区人民公社成立后，由于社大力量大，在短短的时间内全郊区实行了引水灌溉。在一九五八年秋季武汉郊区的蔬菜播种面积约扩大了三万五千亩，而在大办钢铁的号召下，郊区农民还抽出了相当数量的劳动力参加了炼钢炼铁。因为蔬菜的灌水方式由人工挑水改用了沟引自流灌溉，可以节省十倍以上的劳动力，是以一九五八年秋季武汉郊区的蔬菜生产，不仅未因劳动力的减少受到秋旱的影响而减产，而且由于灌溉的方式的改进，保证了蔬菜生长所需要的充足水分而大大地提高了单位面积的产量。如白菜、萝卜等主要蔬菜一般达到了每亩平均一万五千斤至二万斤的大面积丰产。比一九五七年增产了一倍以上。因此，武汉郊区在一九五八年不仅没有因为城市人口的增加而感蔬菜的供应不足，且有力支援了兄弟城市的需要。所以农民说，今年蔬菜产量的加番跃进，是在人民公社成立后改进了灌溉条件，所得到的结果。
  再次是良种繁殖问题。品种多样化是城市郊区蔬菜生产的特点。但这也为蔬菜的良种繁殖带来了很大的困难。因为蔬菜大多数是异花授粉植物，品种愈多，混杂的程度也愈大。例如长丰乡是武汉郊区萝卜的主要产区，各个合作社都拥有十来个品种，在长不到二里左右的小范围内，任是怎样想办法，也免不了颇大程度的混杂。由于混杂的结果，不仅使产品的品质降低，且引起早抽苔的损失。如白菜、甘蓝、莴苣等等都是一样，是以郊区农民过去在良种繁殖上感到非常困难。当一九五八年冬季我们到长丰乡进行调查时，农民们很高兴地对我们说：“我们现在每一个生产区留一个品种，以后每年进行选优繁殖以提高种子的质量，你们可不再对我们的品种混杂而耽心了。”其他公社在留种方法上大都是这样解决了，长期在生产上存在的问题，在公社化后就顺利地得到了解决，此在大田作物良种繁育基地的建立，亦须有赖于公社的优越条件而得到完善的解决。
    随后谈谈农业机械化问题。为了适应和推动农业生产的发展，工具改革和农业机械化占有极其重要的地位。正如周总理在报告中所指出的，“解决农村劳动力不足的根本途径，是提高农业的劳动生产率，是逐步实现技术革新和技术革命，逐步实现农具的半机械化和机械化”。在这个问题上，我过去曾存在着严重的保守思想，认为我国的土地面积广大，原来的工业底子薄，要在广大的农村实现机械化是一件很不容易的事。这次经过下乡，看到了各个公社都有了自己的农具修配厂或农具制造厂，特别是到荆门后的观感使我顿开茅塞。——我国农业机械的实现将随着人民公社的道路而迈步前进，荆门过去是冷落的穷苦山地，现在已轰轰烈烈地成为天沔潜等县的协作钢铁基地。它将为四县的农业机械化提供丰富的物质条件。这样的情况，在全国各地到处都是。因此，我国农业机械化的实现将不是遥远的将来，而在较短的几年时期内一定可以实现。
    总之，农业增产“八字宪法”的重要措施，在人民公社化实现后，是有了更优越的条件得到贯彻执行，并将更加丰富，把我国农业的生产，推向更迅速、更高度的发展。
