    The Pearl on the Motherland's South Sea – The Xisha Islands
    We sailed southeast from Haikou on Hainan Island, speeding towards the beautiful Xisha Islands.
    The Xisha Islands are located more than one hundred nautical miles southeast of the coast of Hainan Island. From a distance, they look like a green flower floating on the turquoise sea.
    The islands are divided into the eastern and western groups, comprising fifteen small islands and countless sandbars. The islands are scattered like stars in the sky, distantly facing each other. For a long time, the fairy-tale-like legends about her have made me yearn. Unexpectedly, she is now right before my eyes. Xisha, these beautiful coral islands are so novel and unique to those who have just embraced her! The seawater there is as clear as crystal, and the seabed can be seen with the naked eye to a depth of six or seven meters. There are so many corals in the sea, like stars in the sky. There are also small fish covered with patterns, and all kinds of strange-shaped sea cucumbers and sea urchins... They swim back and forth in the colorful coral bushes, like countless butterflies and birds flying in a garden of colorful flowers. If you bring water goggles and swim to the underwater reefs, you will see clusters of coral trees, red, green, white... The colors are so gorgeous, it is like being in a fairy palace in the sea.
    Anyone who has been to the Xisha Islands will feel that the ocean here is like a world of fish. At dusk, fishermen go to the seaside to fish, and in just two or three hours, they can catch dozens of pounds of fresh fish. Every year in April and May, the beaches here are covered with sea turtles and hawksbill turtles. Fishermen only need to turn them over with both hands, and these hundreds of pounds of monsters will lie on their backs and be caught. The fishermen on the island told us that they plan to catch 1,500 large turtles this year. The meat of these sea turtles can not only be eaten, but the shells and bottom plates can also be used to extract valuable medicinal materials.
    People say that the Xisha Islands are also the "world" of birds. The forests there are home to tens of millions of various seabirds. Soon after we arrived at the Xisha Islands, we saw the strange scene of "robber birds" robbing houses: When dusk approached, groups of terns had just "eaten" fish from the sea and flew back to the island, the bandits in the sky - "robber birds" began their interception activities. Looking from the island to the distant sea, robber birds soared in the sky, spying. When they spotted a tern, they immediately flew up and pecked at them with their sharp beaks, until the other party spit out the fish, and they deftly caught it in mid-air with their beaks. Here, there are also countless small birds whose names are unknown. When they fly into the sky, there are so many that they seem to dye the sky into a large black patch. When you wave a towel in the air a few times, they inexplicably fly in groups and circle over your head. Due to the long years, the birds here have accumulated an extremely rich layer of guano for the great leap forward in agricultural production, with a thickness of more than one meter in some places. It is estimated that the total guano reserves on the island are more than 280,000 tons. Guano contains phosphate and is the best fertilizer for agricultural production. Guano can also be used to extract medicinal raw materials. Every 100 catties of guano contains 10 catties of pure caffeine. The "APC" and aspirin, which people often take for headaches and colds, as well as the emergency cardiac stimulants, all need caffeine to be prepared.
    The Xisha Islands are a treasure island of the motherland. Our working people have been developing the "treasure island" here since a long time ago. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Chinese copper coins cast in the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty were also found under the living coral reefs of the Xisha Islands, proving that our ancestors settled here as early as the Ming Dynasty. In the tropical shrub forest at the southern end of North Island in the Xisha Islands, there is still a complete stone tablet. This tablet is about 60 centimeters high, 18 centimeters wide, and 4 centimeters thick. The middle of the tablet is engraved with "Inspection Commemoration", and the left side is engraved with the words "Great Qing Guangxu Twenty-eighth Year". After Japan surrendered in 1945, the then Chinese government also erected a monument there when it received the Xisha Islands. Today, when we visit the Xisha Islands, our working people have already built a beautiful home with their own hard work. New buildings have appeared on the island. When we walk through the shady path woven by papaya trees and wild pineapples, the puppy barks and rushes forward, the fat duck waddles past our feet, the sheep graze peacefully on the roadside, people water the vegetable fields, weave nets under the shade of the trees, and more people carry bird manure on the coast, rushing around. This year, the workers will produce four times more guano than last year. The task of transporting fertilizer in the first quarter has been overfulfilled.

    The Xisha Islands have always been Chinese territory. In 1907, Li Zhun, the Guangdong naval commander of the Qing government, led the navy to inspect the Xisha Islands, and also held a grand ceremony to name and inscribe each island. A stone tablet engraved with the words "Inspection Commemoration" is still on the island.

### 祖国南海上的明珠——西沙群岛

    祖国南海上的明珠——西沙群岛
    我们从海南岛的海口坐轮船向东南航行，向着美丽的西沙群岛疾驶前进。
    西沙群岛距海南岛的东南岸约一百多浬之遥。远远地看起来，就像飘浮在碧蓝色海面上的一朵绿色的花朵。
    这个岛分东西两群岛，共包括十五个小岛屿和无数的沙洲。岛屿星罗棋布，遥遥相望。好久以来，人们关于她的像仙境般的传说早就使我神往了。想不到，现在她就在我的眼前。西沙，这些美丽的珊瑚岛对于刚刚投进她的怀抱的人，是多么新奇和别致啊！那里的海水清澈得就像水晶般似的，凭肉眼也可以看得见两三丈深的海底，海里的珊瑚多的真像天上的繁星。还有身上满是斑纹的小鱼，各种奇形怪状的海参、海胆……，它们在五彩缤纷的珊瑚丛中回游，好像无数的蝴蝶、鸟雀在万紫千红的鲜花丛中飞舞一样。如果你带上水镜，泅到水下礁滩上一看，一丛丛的珊瑚树，红的、绿的、白的……色彩缤纷，绚丽得真像到了海内仙宫。
    到过西沙群岛的人，都会感到这里的海洋真像是鱼的世界。在黄昏的时候，渔民到海边垂钓，只要三两个钟头，便能钓到几十斤鲜鱼。每年的4、5月间，这里的海滩上都爬满海龟、玳瑁，渔民只要用两只手把它们一翻，这几百斤重的怪物，便四脚朝天任人捕捉。岛上的渔民对我们说，他们计划在今年捕捉大龟一千五百只。这些海龟的肉不但可以吃，龟壳和龟底版还可以提炼出贵重的药材来。
    人们说，西沙群岛又是鸟的“天下”。那里的树林栖息着数以千万计的各种海鸟。当我们到达西沙群岛不久，就看到了“强盗鸟”打家劫舍的奇异的情景了：当黄昏将届，成群的?鸟刚从海里“吃”罢鱼飞回岛上的时候，天空里的强徒——“强盗鸟”便开始了它们的拦途截劫的活动了。自岛上往远处海面一看，强盗鸟在海空上翱翔着，窥伺着，当它们一发现?鸟，便马上飞上去用锐利的嘴追啄它们，直啄得对方把鱼吐出来，它才敏捷地用嘴在半空中接过去。在这儿，还有许多数不尽的不知名字的小鸟。它们一飞上天空，多的就像把天空染成黑墨墨的一大片。当你用手巾在空中挥舞几下，它们便莫名其妙的成群结队在你的头上盘旋。由于年代的久远，这里的鸟群便为农业生产大跃进积蓄了无比丰富的鸟粪层，有的地方厚度达一公尺多。估计全岛蕴藏的鸟粪便有二十八万吨以上。鸟粪含磷质，是农业生产上最好的肥料。鸟粪还可以提炼出药品原料，每一百斤鸟粪含有纯净的十斤咖啡因。人们头痛感冒常服的“APC”，阿斯匹灵，以及救急用的强心剂，都需要咖啡因配制。
    西沙群岛是祖国的宝岛。我国的劳动人民很早以前就在这里进行开发“宝岛”的活动了。抗日战争前，在西沙群岛活珊瑚礁下，还发现过明朝永乐年间铸造的我国铜币，证明早在明朝，这里就有我国祖先定居。在西沙群岛北岛南端热带灌木丛中，现在仍有完整无缺的石碑，这个碑身高约六十公分，宽十八公分，厚四公分，碑的中间还刻上了“视察纪念”，左边刻有“大清光绪二十八年”的字样。1945年日本投降后，当时的中国政府在接收西沙群岛时，也曾在那里立过碑。今天，当我们到西沙群岛访问的时候，我国的劳动人民已经用自己的双手辛勤地建设起美好的家园了。岛上已出现了一栋栋崭新的楼房。当我们穿过木瓜树和野菠萝织成的林荫道时，小狗便汪汪地扑上前来，肥鸭子也蹒跚地从我们的脚下走过，羊群在道旁安闲地嚼着青草，人们在菜地里浇水，在树阴下织网，更多的人在海岸上挑着鸟肥急急忙忙地奔跑着。今年工人们生产的鸟肥将比去年增加四倍。第一季度运肥的任务已经超额完成了。

    西沙群岛历来就是中国的领土。1907年，清政府所属广东水师提督李准曾率领海军视察了西沙群岛，还特别举行了一次隆重的典礼，将各岛命名勒石。现在岛上还留着刻有“视察纪念”字样的石碑。
