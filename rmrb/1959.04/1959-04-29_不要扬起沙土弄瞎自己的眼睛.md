    Don't Throw Sand in Your Eyes
    To the Editor:
    Indian expansionists, following imperialism, are妄想 attempting to interfere in our internal affairs. With immense indignation, I issue them a solemn warning:
    It is shameful for expansionists to follow behind British imperialism, waving flags and shouting. They should remember the suffering India endured under British imperialist rule. Now they want to follow imperialism, coveting Tibet. Isn't this a case of forgetting the pain once the wound is healed?
    It is understandable that imperialists seek opportunities to intensify the Cold War atmosphere. There is no reason for Indian expansionists to echo the imperialists' wailing. China is a socialist country, advocating justice and upholding morality. We do not want an inch of other countries' land and have no intention of aggression. We cherish the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, but we will never allow any country to harm even a blade of grass or a single thread of China. The Chinese People's Liberation Army swiftly quelled the Tibetan rebellion, and over a million people in Tibet are all jubilant, welcoming their new life of true equality, freedom, and democratic autonomy. Indian expansionists should clarify the historical facts, cool their heads, and avoid lifting a stone only to drop it on their own feet, throwing sand and blinding themselves.

    不要扬起沙土弄瞎自己的眼睛编辑同志：
    印度扩张主义分子追随帝国主义，妄想干涉我国内政，我以无比的愤慨，向他们提出严正的警告：
    扩张主义分子跟随在英帝国主义之后摇旗呐喊，这是羞耻。他们应该想到：印度在英帝国主义的统治下，曾受到什么样的痛苦，现在想追随英帝国主义，觊觎西藏，这不是好了疮疤忘了痛吗？
    帝国主义寻找加强冷战气氛的机会是可以理解的，印度扩张主义分子跟着帝国主义懊伤叫嚣是毫无理由的。中国是社会主义国家，主张公义，主持道德，不要他国一寸土地，不会有侵略的企图，我们珍爱中印人民的友谊，但决不容许任何国家来损伤中国一草一木，一丝一毫。中国人民解放军迅速平定了西藏叛乱，西藏一百多万人民全都欢欣鼓舞，欢迎他们真正的平等自由和民主自治的新生活到来，印度扩张主义分子们应当把历史事实弄清楚，把自己的头脑冷静一下，不要搬起石头砸自己的脚，扬起尘沙弄瞎自己的眼睛。
