    Not a Single Patch Missed, Not a Single Insect Released: Be Swift, Skillful, Accurate, and Ruthless!
    Resolutely Eradicate Pests and Diseases in Their Initial Stages.
    Various localities actively begin prevention and control, striving to ensure the healthy growth of crops.
    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to ensure an even greater harvest of crops this year, various localities are seizing the opportunity as crop pests and diseases transition from the overwintering stage to the initial outbreak stage, actively deploying battles for the comprehensive encirclement and suppression of pests and diseases, and have put forward the resounding slogan of "Not a single patch missed, not a single insect released, resolutely eliminate pests and diseases in their initial stages." Some areas have already launched the advance guard battles to eliminate insects and eradicate diseases.
    This spring, due to higher temperatures and more rainfall, the overwintering mortality rate of pests is low, and the incubation period is earlier. Wheat rust has already occurred in some wheat fields in provinces such as Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Anhui. In individual heavily fertilized and densely planted wheat fields, rust is developing rapidly; in addition, pests such as wheat aphids and wheat spider mites have been successively discovered; it is estimated that wheat midges will also occur earlier. In cotton-growing areas, aphids that harm cotton have already hatched in large numbers. Pests such as cutworms and armyworm moths have also appeared earlier in some areas of provinces such as Shanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui. According to forecasts from meteorological departments, rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Yangtze-Huai River basin in April will be higher than normal. With the steady rise in temperature, crop pests and diseases are extremely prone to breeding, requiring various localities to prepare for prevention and control as early as possible.
    In order to strive to eliminate pests and diseases in their initial stages, various localities have earnestly implemented the "protection" character (plant protection) of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture this year, and have made full preparations for pest and disease prevention and control work early on. Now, on the one hand, they are closely monitoring the occurrence of pests and diseases, and on the other hand, they are giving the emerging pests and diseases a head-on blow.
    In the winter wheat areas, Henan Province has dispatched a large number of personnel to conduct a general survey of the occurrence and development of rust and wheat midges, while simultaneously carrying out prevention and control. The concentrated insect control campaign in Nanyang Prefecture has already begun, striving to completely eliminate wheat midges. Tanghe County in this prefecture has established 835 prediction stations, clarified the insect situation in the county's wheat fields, and under the slogan of "inspecting, preparing, and preventing and controlling simultaneously," combined with topdressing jointing fertilizer, adopted the method of applying medicine and fertilizer together, and controlled wheat midges in more than 180,000 mu of wheat fields. Gansu Province issued an emergency notice requiring various localities to firmly defend the wheat jointing stage and completely eliminate rust. Jingchuan County in this province established a rust prevention headquarters led by the county party secretary, mobilizing more than 99,000 people throughout the county, forming ten major corps, 132 shock teams, and more than 970 professional groups, to prevent and control rust in more than 970,000 mu of wheat fields. Shaanxi Province launched a concentrated rust prevention campaign in early and mid-March, calling on the entire party and all the people to take action, comprehensively encircle and suppress, and professional teams to sweep up the remnants, truly achieving "swift, accurate, and ruthless," and completely eliminating stripe rust before the jointing stage. At present, the province has generally treated the diseased wheat fields two or three times, with some reaching six or seven times.
    The cotton-growing provinces are also carrying out concentrated efforts to eliminate cotton aphids and small cutworm adults. Xinxiang County in Henan Province held a field conference in a timely manner, deciding that the secretaries or chairmen of each commune should personally lead the prevention and control work, and launch a concentrated campaign to thoroughly control aphids and trap and kill cutworm adults. The seven communes and 104 teams in the county have trapped and killed a large number of cutworm moths. Qianjiang County in Hubei Province launched a concentrated month to eliminate overwintering hosts of cotton and grain pests in March, with more than 26,000 people participating in insect control, having sprayed all cotton warehouses with medicine and thoroughly treated withered bolls, withered leaves, and cotton and rice straw.
    In addition, pest and disease prevention and control work has also been actively carried out in rice and miscellaneous grain areas, such as concentrated treatment of residual overwintering pests and diseases and treatment of spring-sown crop seeds.
    At present, prevention and control work is being carried out in depth in various localities, and before pests and diseases have generally bred, prevention and control preparation work is being carried out without the slightest relaxation. Jiangsu and Anhui provinces are actively carrying out organizational work and preparing pesticides to prevent stem rust and scab. Suzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu Province has established pest and disease prevention and control headquarters at all levels from the prefecture and county to the commune, and at the same time, has vigorously promoted the movement of native pesticides, having produced 12 million jin of native pesticides; the 120,000 sprayers in the region have also been basically repaired. Lujiang County in Anhui Province overhauled its original 100-plus sprayers and added more than 700 single and double-tube sprayers. Because the preparation work for pest and disease prevention and control this year has been done early and quickly, the masses in various localities have great confidence in eliminating insects and eradicating diseases, and are full of energy to completely eliminate pests and diseases, ensuring the realization of a greater harvest this year.

    一块不漏　一虫不放　要猛要巧　要准要狠
    坚决把病虫害歼灭在初发阶段
    各地积极开始防治，力保农作物健壮成长
    本报讯　为了确保今年农作物的更大丰收，各地正趁农作物病虫害从越冬阶段进入初发阶段的时机，积极部署全面围歼病虫害的战斗，并且提出了“一块不漏，一虫不放，坚决把病虫害消灭在初发阶段”的响亮口号。有些地区已经展开了灭虫除病的前哨战。
    今年春季由于气温较高和雨水较多，害虫越冬死亡率低，孵化期提早，现在已经进入初发阶段。河南、陕西、甘肃、安徽等省的部分麦田，已经发生了麦锈病，个别重肥密植的麦田，锈病发展较快；此外，麦蚜、麦蜘蛛等病虫已经陆续发现；估计吸浆虫也会提早发生。在棉区，为害棉花的蚜虫已经大量孵化。地老虎和粘虫蛾等病虫也分别在山西、河南、江苏、安徽等省部分地区提早出现。根据气象部门的预告，4月份黄河中下游和长江淮河流域降水量将较常年为多，随着气温的平稳上升，农作物病虫害极易孳生，要求各地及早准备防治。
    为了力争把病虫害消灭在初发阶段，今年各地认真地执行了农业八字宪法中的“保”字（植物保护）一条，对病虫害防治工作提早作了充分的准备。现在正在一面密切监视病虫害发生情况，一面给露头的病虫害以迎头痛击。
    在冬麦区，河南省抽调了大批人力普查锈病和吸浆虫发生发展情况，同时进行防治。南阳专区突击治虫运动已经开始，争取全歼小麦吸浆虫。这个专区的唐河县建立了八百三十五个预测站，查清了全县麦田的虫情，并且在“边检查、边准备、边防治”的口号下，结合追施拔节肥，采取药肥混施的办法，在十八万多亩麦田中防治了吸浆虫。甘肃省发出紧急通知要求各地坚守小麦拔节关，彻底消灭锈病。这个省的泾川县由县委书记挂帅成立了防锈指挥部，全县出动九万九千多人，组成十个大兵团、一百三十二个突击队和九百七十多个专业组，在九十七万多亩麦田中防治锈病。陕西省在3月上中旬就展开了突击防锈战役，号召全党全民动手，全面围剿，专业队扫残，确实作到“猛、准、狠”，彻底把条锈病消灭在拔节前。目前全省对已经发病的麦田普治了两三次，多的达六七次。
    棉区各省也在突击消灭棉蚜和小地老虎成虫。河南省新乡县及时召开了战地会议，决定由各公社的书记或社长亲自领导防治工作，突击开展彻底治蚜和诱杀地老虎成虫的运动。全县七个公社、一百零四个队已诱杀了大量地老虎蛾子。湖北潜光县3月份开展了消灭棉粮害虫越冬寄主突击月，二万六千多人参加治虫，已经将所有的棉花仓库喷了药，并彻底处理了枯铃、枯叶和棉、稻秸秆等。
    此外，在稻区和杂粮区也都积极开展了病虫害防治工作，如突击处理残留越冬病虫和进行春播作物种子的处理等。
    目前，各地防治工作正在深入开展，在病虫害还没有普遍孳生以前，防治准备工作正在一刻不放松地进行。江苏、安徽两省为防治秆锈病和赤霉病，积极进行组织工作和准备农药。江苏省苏州专区由专区、县到社，层层成立了防治病虫害指挥部，同时大搞土农药的运动，已经生产了土农药一千二百万斤；全区十二万架喷雾器也基本上修好。安徽省庐江县检修了原有的一百多架喷雾器，还添置了七百多架单双管喷雾器。由于今年防治病虫害的准备工作做得又早又快，各地群众灭虫除病的信心很大，正鼓足干劲要全歼病虫害，保证实现今年更大丰收。（附图片）
