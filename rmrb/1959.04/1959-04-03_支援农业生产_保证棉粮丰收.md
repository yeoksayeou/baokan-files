·Agricultural Tool "Doctors" Go on "House Calls" in Teams·
Recently, commercial departments in Luxian County’s Fuji, Cangxi County’s Wulong, Daxian County’s Luojiang, and Pingchang County’s Sitan in Sichuan Province organized large numbers of iron, bamboo, and woodworking laborers to go deep into various farming areas and production teams to vigorously repair old agricultural tools and add new ones. The Luojiang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Daxian County adopted a method of organizing supply through the commercial department and helping communes to make their own, vigorously producing agricultural tools. It has now stockpiled more than 420,000 pieces of various iron, bamboo, wood, and palm agricultural tools and implements. In addition to increasing two iron furnaces to produce small agricultural tools, the Sitan branch store in Pingchang County also organized six iron furnaces to go down to the teams to repair old agricultural tools on a mobile basis, and has now repaired 1,200 hoes. The Wulong District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Cangxi County adopted the method of "repairing mainly, supplemented by new manufacturing," assigning workers who manufacture small agricultural tools to the production teams by production brigade units, and cooperating with the original carpenters in the countryside to set up factories to repair old agricultural tools and add new ones.

    Chemical Raw Materials Delivered to the Door
The Lüda City Native Produce and Sundries Company actively collects native fertilizer raw materials to support agricultural production. Upon hearing that aquatic product processing plants had fish scraps, fish scales, waste ammonia water, nitrate water, and other materials, they promptly contacted the Lüda Environmental Sanitation Management Office and mobilized all employees to spend two days transporting more than 20 tons of fish scraps and other materials to the native fertilizer processing plant.

    Cages and Baskets as Warehouses, Field Ridges as Counters
In order to better support the current busy agricultural production and facilitate purchases and sales for its members, the Gangwei Commune Supply and Marketing Department in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, recently formed a busy farming season purchase and sales service team to go deep into the mountains and fields, delivering goods to the fields, supplying them to the door, and purchasing them at hand, which is very popular among the masses.
    This busy farming season purchase and sales service team carries more than 100 kinds of daily necessities urgently needed by the masses, not afraid of high mountains and long roads, and rugged paths, and insists on serving the members by going down to the fields and up the mountains. They put forward the slogan "Cages and baskets are warehouses, field ridges are counters, where the masses are, the goods are carried there, wholeheartedly serving the masses, and vigorously supporting increased production," and adopt regular fixed-point and irregular mobile supply, combining the supply with the purchase of waste products, so as to achieve "one load of goods goes out, one load of waste products comes in," combining purchase and sales to facilitate the masses.

    支援农业生产　保证棉粮丰收
    ·农具“医生”结队“出诊”·
    最近四川省泸县福集、苍溪县五龙、达县罗江和平昌县澌滩等地的商业部门组织大批铁、竹、木工人深入各耕作区和生产队，大力整修旧农具和添置新农具。达县罗江供销社采取由商业部门组织供应和帮助公社自制自用的办法，大力生产农具。现在已储备各种铁、竹、木、棕农具和工具四十二万多件。平昌县澌滩分销店除了增加二个铁炉生产小农具外，还组织了六个铁炉下队流动整修旧农具，现已修补锄头一千二百把。苍溪县五龙区供销社采取“修整为主，新制跟上”的办法，把制造小农具的工人以生产大队为单位分下队去，配合农村中原有的木工，设厂整修旧农具和添制新农具。

    化学原料送上门
    旅大市土产杂品公司积极收集土化肥原料支援农业生产。他们听到水产加工厂有鱼杂、鱼鳞、废氨水、硝水等物资，就及时与旅大环境卫生管理处联系，发动全体职工利用两天时间将二十多吨鱼杂等运到土化肥加工厂。　　　　　　（崔国恕）
    笼担为仓库　田埂当柜台
    福建省海澄县港尾公社供销部为了更好地支持当前的农忙生产，便利社员购销，最近组成一支农忙购销服务队，深入山野田间，送货下田，登门供应，随手收购，深受群众欢迎。
    这支农忙购销服务队带着一百多种群众日常迫切需要的用品，不怕山高路远，小路崎岖，坚持着下田上山为社员服务。他们提出“笼担为仓库，田埂当柜台，群众到那里，货担跟那里，一心为群众，大力支援增产”的口号，采取定期定点和不定期不定点的巡回供应，在供应的同时，结合收购废品，做到
  “一担商品出门，一担废品入门”，购销结合，群众称便。
