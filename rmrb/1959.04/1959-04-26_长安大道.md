    Chang'an Avenue
    Zhu Guang
    Chang'an Avenue runs east to west, the sun and moon pass overhead, the view endless,
    Red rain fills the city, cars like water, pedestrians coming and going, spirit like a rainbow.
    Chang'an Avenue rises with tall buildings, lights shining brightly across the nine provinces,
    One might suspect stars fallen from the sky, human dwellings planned with foresight.
    Chang'an Avenue sees spring return, roadside trees forming shade, a green belt surrounding,
    Pines, cypresses, elms, and locusts compete to excel, swallows from the village fly into the palace.
    Chang'an Avenue again feels the east wind, sweeping away the yellow sand, the rising sun red,
    Everywhere flowers fly to welcome the grand festival, Tian'an Men shares joy with the people.
    Following Comrade Zhu Guang's Rhymes on Chang'an
    Avenue by Dong Biwu
    Chang'an Avenue runs east to west, hub to hub, shoulder to shoulder, how can it be poor!
    Enthusiasm increases, walking is open and wide, ten thousand people exhaling can form a rainbow.
    Chang'an Avenue rises with tall buildings, blocking the sun, connecting to the clouds, pressing down on Jizhou.
    At night electric lights spit out flames together, weak and strong light intertwined.
    Chang'an Avenue sees spring return, ten thousand greens and thousands of reds embroidered as brocade.
    Only the old swallows in the palace, bewildered by the future, fly around the branches.
    Chang'an Avenue again feels the east wind, overwhelming the west wind, blowing until red.
    Welcoming May Day amidst the leap forward, cheering for victory throughout the world.

    长安大道
    朱光
    长安大道贯西东，日月经天望不穷，
    红雨满城车似水，行人来往气如虹。
    长安大道起重楼，灯火辉煌照九州，
    疑是群星天上落，人间广厦有绸缪。
    长安大道见春归，路树成阴绿带围，
    松柏榆槐争拔萃，村来燕子入宫飞。
    长安大道又东风，扫净黄沙旭日红，
    处处花飞迎盛节，天安长乐与人同。
    次朱光同志长安
    大道韵董必武
    长安大道贯西东，毂击肩摩岂为穷！
    干劲益增行坦荡，万人嘘气可成虹。
    长安大道起重楼，蔽日连云压蓟州。
    入夜电灯齐吐焰，弱强光线耿相缪。
    长安大道见春归，万绿千红锦绣围。
    只有旧时宫里燕，迷离前景绕枝飞。
    长安大道又东风，压倒西风吹不红。
    跃进声中迎五一，欢呼胜利普天同。
