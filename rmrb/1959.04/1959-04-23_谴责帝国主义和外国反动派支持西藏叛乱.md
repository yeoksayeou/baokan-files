Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: The strong indignation of the 600 million people of the country against the acts of imperialism and foreign reactionaries in supporting the Tibetan armed rebellion and interfering in China's internal affairs was concentratedly expressed in today's first plenary discussion of the National People's Congress. All the representatives who spoke invariably refuted the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials, solemnly condemned the crimes of the Tibetan rebels in undermining the unification of the motherland, and condemned the imperialists and Indian expansionists who openly supported the Tibetan rebellion.

    The Panchen Erdeni solemnly declared: Our Tibet will always be Chinese Tibet, and we will never allow any foreigners to interfere in our Tibet and our China!

When Panchen Erdeni Qoiji Gyaltsen, delegate to the National People's Congress and Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, made his first speech today, he solemnly declared: "Our Tibet will always be Chinese Tibet, and we will never allow any foreigners to interfere in our Tibet and our China!"

When the Panchen Lama made this solemn declaration on behalf of all Tibetan monks and lay people, all the representatives immediately responded with a long and stormy applause. The passionate atmosphere in the venue fully demonstrated the strong will of our people to safeguard the unity of the motherland and national unity.

In his speech, Panchen Erdeni pointed out that the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," distributed by Indian diplomatic officials, had nothing in common when compared with the Dalai Lama's usual words and deeds or with the three personal letters the Dalai Lama wrote to Tan Guansan, the Central Government's acting representative. The tone of the statement was neither the Dalai Lama's own nor the tone we Tibetans are accustomed to. It is very clear that this so-called statement was imposed on the Dalai Lama by foreigners.

Panchen Erdeni sternly refuted the absurd argument in this so-called "statement" that uses the difference between Tibetans and Han people as an excuse for "independence." He pointed out that the Tibetan local government formally joined the Chinese territory in the 13th century, and since then, Tibet has been an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The Tibetan people understand from their own experience that the inevitable result of breaking away from the motherland is not the "independence" of Tibet, but the transformation of Tibet into a foreign colony and protectorate. Under the poisonous hands of British invaders and their running dogs, the previous Panchen was forced to leave, Living Buddha Reting was murdered, Living Buddha Geda was poisoned to death, and the Dalai Lama's father was also poisoned to death. These are the bloody lessons that so-called "Tibetan independence" has taught us. Now some Indians are talking about "Tibetan independence" again, or saying something like "recognizing China's suzerainty, but not allowing China to interfere in Tibet's internal affairs." Panchen Erdeni said, may I ask these Indians: Why can't China manage China's affairs, but others can? What is the difference between this and what the British used to say?

Panchen Erdeni pointed out that the eyes of the Tibetan people, who have suffered from foreign aggression for many years, are sharp, and they can clearly distinguish who are friends and who are enemies. No matter how cleverly disguised, any imperialists and foreign reactionaries cannot deceive people.

Panchen Erdeni concluded by saying that the conspiracy of the Tibetan rebels to create "independence" has gone bankrupt. These rebels, under the instructions of their foreign masters, are engaging in activities to split the motherland in the name of the Dalai Lama, which is completely useless. He said that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has now exercised the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government. During the Dalai Lama's abduction, he obeyed the order of the State Council to act as the chairman of the committee. He expressed his determination to unite all Tibetan cadres and monks and lay people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and strive to complete the glorious mission entrusted to him by the country and the people. He sincerely hopes that the Dalai Lama can get rid of his abducted situation and return to the embrace of the motherland, and work with the Tibetan people to build a bright and happy new Tibet.

    Apei Awang Jinmei used his own personal experience to thoroughly expose the lies in the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" that slandered the Central People's Government for forcing them to sign the agreement and undermining the agreement.

Apei Awang Jinmei, delegate to the National People's Congress, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, pointed out in his speech that the Tibetan original local government and the upper-class reactionary group gathered rebels to launch a rebellion in order to realize their shameful purpose of seeking refuge in imperialism and enslaving the Tibetan people forever.

Apei Awang Jinmei was the chief plenipotentiary representative of the Tibetan local government who negotiated and signed the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet with the Central People's Government in 1951. He used his own personal experience to thoroughly expose the lies in the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" that slandered the Central People's Government for forcing them to sign the agreement and undermining the agreement. He said that the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was signed with the Central Plenipotentiary Representative on a cordial and friendly basis after detailed discussions and achieving a consensus that satisfied both parties. After the signing of the agreement, the People's Liberation Army and staff who entered Tibet to consolidate national defense have always conscientiously abided by the agreement and the policy of national equality and unity, and have achieved remarkable results. This has been confirmed by the personal experience of the Tibetan people. However, the original local government and the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet have been colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to obstruct the implementation of this agreement.

Apei Awang Jinmei was an eyewitness to the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan rebels, and after the rebellion began, he forwarded letters between General Tan Guansan and the Dalai Lama. The rebellion process he exposed at the meeting today thoroughly punctured the rumors in the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama." He said that after the rebellion broke out on March 10, in order to help the Dalai Lama, Tan Guansan, the acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet, wrote three letters to the Dalai Lama, two of which he personally delivered. The Dalai Lama also sent back three handwritten letters through him. In the letters, he wrote in detail about the various coercions the Dalai Lama was subjected to by the rebels. Sure enough, on the evening of March 17, the Dalai Lama was abducted by the rebels. Then, starting at 3:40 am on March 20, the rebels launched an armed attack on the People's Liberation Army troops in Lhasa and the organs sent by the Central Government to Tibet. In order to defend the unity of the motherland and the safety of the Tibetan people, the People's Liberation Army had to fight back at 10:00 am Beijing time on March 20. With the sincere support of the broad masses of the Tibetan people, the rebellion in the Lhasa area was quelled in a very short time. Before this, the People's Liberation Army had never fired a single bullet. This can be proven by all the monks and lay people in Lhasa.

Apei Awang Jinmei said that since the Dalai Lama took charge of government, I have been with the Dalai Lama all the time. In the past eight years, whether in public speeches or in private talks with Tibetan officials, we have never heard him say anything about "Tibetan independence" or splitting the unity of the motherland. It can be completely determined that the statement issued in India in the name of the Dalai Lama was definitely not from the Dalai Lama's own will. Apei Awang Jinmei said: "I think when the Dalai Lama sits in meditation, he will feel the pain of being abducted and used, so he will find the correct measures and methods to get rid of being abducted."

    Li Jishen pointed out that we cherish the friendship between China and India very much, but we must never allow Indian expansionists to use this friendship as a shield to interfere in China's internal affairs.

Li Jishen, delegate to the National People's Congress and chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, refuted the absurd remarks publicly made by certain so-called "politicians" in India recently, and condemned the Indian expansionists' interference in China's internal affairs. He said that some politicians in India have shown great "enthusiasm" for the rebellion of a small number of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet. On the one hand, they say that "India recognizes China's suzerainty over Tibet," and on the other hand, they describe the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet as a "manifestation of Tibetan patriotic sentiment," expressing "sympathy" for the rebels and "unease" about our country's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion.

Li Jishen solemnly questioned: The Tibetan reactionary group is engaged in betraying the motherland, how can it be said to be a "manifestation of patriotic sentiment"? Is it that those who say these words believe that opposing the Chinese Central People's Government and splitting from China is patriotism? If so, then which country do they love? Is it China? Or is it India? If their rebellion has nothing to do with Indian expansionists, then why are some politicians in India so sympathetic to the treasonous crimes of the Tibetan reactionary group? Why has Kalimpong been able to serve as the center of these rebels' activities abroad for a long time? Why is the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials?

Li Jishen pointed out that the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" openly raised the banner of so-called Tibetan independence, which not only fully shows that what the Tibetan rebels are pursuing is not autonomy at all, but more importantly, it shows that the Indian expansionists have become hot-headed. They regard the Chinese side's emphasis on Sino-Indian friendly relations and its utmost restraint in these days as a sign of weakness and deception. The ambitions of these expansionists are really not small, they simply want to turn Tibet into their colony or protectorate.

Li Jishen emphasized in conclusion that the US imperialists are still occupying our country's Taiwan, and now some people want to treat our country's Tibet as their sphere of influence. However, today's China is no longer the China of the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. We must liberate Taiwan, and we must never allow any foreigners to interfere in Tibet. Any foreign support for the armed rebels in Tibet is an interference in China's internal affairs and an infringement on China's sovereignty, which is absolutely not allowed by our more than 600 million Chinese people. He said that we cherish the friendship between China and India very much, and we will strive to consolidate and develop this friendship in the past, present and future. However, we must never allow expansionists to use this friendship as a shield to interfere in China's internal affairs. These expansionists had better clear their heads, the era when China could be bullied by others is gone forever. It is impossible to inherit the legacy of British imperialism's aggression against Tibet.

    Shen Junru offered straightforward advice that the Indian expansionists' interference in China's internal affairs is undermining India's reputation in international affairs.

Shen Junru, delegate to the National People's Congress and chairman of the China Democratic League, pointed out in his speech that the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet dared to launch a rebellion because they had the support of imperialism, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and Indian expansionists. He said that it was what we expected that the imperialists and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang would carry out conspiracies to undermine our country's unity, but we did not expect that some people in India would support the criminal activities of a small group of traitors in Tibet to split Tibet from China.

Shen Junru said that India and China have a long tradition of friendship, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China and India have been recognized by more and more countries as the准则 for handling international affairs, but after the Tibetan rebellion occurred this time, many slanders against China with the same tone as the imperialists, the so-called sympathy and encouragement to the Tibetan rebel group, have appeared in large numbers in Indian newspapers and in the discussions and statements of some Indian politicians. Recently, the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" was even distributed by Indian government officials. Is this in line with the interests of friendly relations between China and India? Is this in line with the Five Principles advocated by the Indian government? Is this being a good friend?

Shen Junru expressed strong indignation and condemnation of the Indian expansionists' interference in China's internal affairs. He said that the actions of certain politicians in India are now undermining the reputation that India has earned in international affairs in recent years. If this situation continues to develop, it will be difficult to distinguish it from the past aggressive acts of British imperialists in Tibet. As a friend of India, it is necessary to offer straightforward advice at this critical moment.

    Huang Yanpei reminded certain Indian people to pay attention to the fact that carrying out anti-China political activities in India damages India's interests and only makes the colonialists happy.

Huang Yanpei, delegate to the National People's Congress and chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, which is recognized by the whole world, including India. The rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary elements and the suppression of this rebellion are China's internal affairs, and no foreign country can interfere.

Huang Yanpei expressed his great indignation at the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials. He solemnly questioned: Did the Indian authorities know in advance about such a political document that openly attacks the Chinese government?

Huang Yanpei said that for a long time, the Tibetan reactionary elements have used Kalimpong, India, as the center of their conspiracy activities abroad. After the Tibetan rebellion occurred, the Tibetan rebels fled to India, where they were treated warmly and welcomed enthusiastically, and a clamor for so-called Tibetan "independence" was stirred up in India. Now, such an absurd document can be distributed through Indian officials. From this series of facts, can we find even a trace of conformity with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence? Hasn't Prime Minister Nehru said that political activities against another country are not allowed to be carried out in India? Are the above-mentioned anti-China political activities allowed by a country that is friendly to China?

Huang Yanpei solemnly pointed out: I would like to remind the Indian people to pay attention to the fact that if the situation were reversed, if one or another of India's neighboring countries used their country's territory as a center for foreign activities against India, to split off one state or province of India, may I ask, could the people and government of India tolerate it? On such a serious issue that is related to the "Five Principles" and the friendly relations between China and India, if we continue to move in the wrong direction, it will only damage the interests of India, which has always been known for advocating peaceful coexistence, and it will only make the colonialists happy.

    Awang Jiacuo, who lived in Tibet for twenty-seven years, said that the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet have their hands stained with the blood of the Tibetan people and are the real enemies of the Tibetan people.

Awang Jiacuo, delegate to the National People's Congress, vice chairman of the Buddhist Association of China, and vice governor of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, lived in Tibet for twenty-seven years and served as the Khenpo of the Sera Monastery in Lhasa. He personally witnessed the actions of the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet. He pointed out in his speech today: For a long time, a small group of Tibetan traitors have been engaged in conspiracies to collude with imperialists and foreign reactionaries to undermine the motherland. The upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet who shout about "protecting national interests" have long had their hands stained with the blood of the Tibetan people. They have been extorting and plundering, killing and setting fires, raping and looting, and doing all kinds of evil. They also kept Tibetan troops, set up prisons everywhere, and used cruel tortures such as gouging out eyes, cutting off noses, ripping out hearts, and skinning to suppress the people. Awang Jiacuo said: The broad masses of the Tibetan people know clearly from historical facts that it is precisely these reactionary rulers who shout about "protecting national interests" who are the real enemies of the Tibetan people.

Awang Jiacuo continued: "Protecting religion" is another banner raised by the Tibetan traitors. They disguise themselves as devout Buddhists to cover up their criminal activities. Awang Jiacuo said: I have personally experienced their tricks of playing with religion. When they need to use the name of religion to carry out some criminal activities, they convene a meeting of the Khenpos of the three major monasteries in Tibet, such as Sera Monastery, impose their will on the masses of lamas, and then use the name of the three major monasteries to deceive the masses and force the lamas to violate religious rules and engage in the crime of fighting and killing people.

Awang Jiacuo exposed the crimes of the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet in killing Living Buddhas in order to collude with imperialists. He said: In 1947, because the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet colluded with imperialists, they were opposed by the patriotic and anti-imperialist former Tibetan King Reting Living Buddha. Soikang Wangqing Gele and Lhalu and others led troops to arrest Reting Living Buddha and tortured him to death. The three major Living Buddhas and many lamas under Reting Living Buddha were either imprisoned or exiled, and all were persecuted. Awang Jiacuo said: I also escaped to the mainland because of this. After I escaped, they also issued an order to offer a heavy reward to cut off my head. Later, they killed my younger brother Cili Jiacuo, claimed that his head was my head, said that I had been killed by them, and publicized it widely. He said: Because of the Reting incident, the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet also led troops to attack Sera Monastery, and nearly one hundred kind and innocent lamas in the monastery were killed and injured. The thirteen Kongcun under the jurisdiction of Sera Monastery were looted. Awang Jiacuo pointed out: In 1950, when the patriotic Living Buddha Geda arrived in Qamdo for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, he was poisoned to death by the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet and the British agent Ford.

Awang Jiacuo said: May I ask, is all this the so-called "protection of religion"? Is this the behavior that a devout Buddhist should have? The upper-class reactionary group in Tibet is a criminal who betrays the motherland, betrays the interests of the nation, and betrays the teachings of Buddhism. Their characteristics are: shameless and inhuman. You cannot find anything that an upright person should have in them.

During the speeches at the conference, bursts of applause resounded continuously in the venue, and all the representatives were in high spirits.

The representatives who spoke at the meeting today all expressed their support for Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the various reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen at the meeting.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Dong Biwu, Cheng Qian, He Xiangning, Zhang Wentian, Chen Yu, Sheng Pihua, Shu Sheyu, Qian Chongshu, Zhang Shizhao, Dao Jingban, and Wang Chonglun.

All members of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference attended the meeting as nonvoting delegates.

Foreign envoys to China and some foreign guests in Beijing were invited to attend the meeting as nonvoting delegates.

Today's plenary discussion was held from 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm. In the morning, the meeting held group discussions on the various reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

### 谴责帝国主义和外国反动派支持西藏叛乱

专栏：

    全国人民代表大会的讲台上发出了六亿人民的庄严声音
    谴责帝国主义和外国反动派支持西藏叛乱
    班禅额尔德尼、阿沛·阿旺晋美、李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、阿旺嘉错驳斥所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”
    指出印度某些人对西藏的扩张野心、对中国内政的干涉，只有利于帝国主义而不利于中印友好
    新华社22日讯　全国六亿人民对帝国主义和外国反动派支持西藏武装叛乱、干涉中国内政的行为的强烈愤慨，集中地表现在全国人民代表大会今天的第一次大会讨论中。所有发言的代表都毫无例外地驳斥了由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，严正地谴责了西藏叛乱分子破坏祖国统一的罪行，谴责了公开支持西藏叛乱的帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子。
    班禅额尔德尼郑重宣告：我们西藏永远是中国的西藏，我们永远不许任何外国人干涉我们西藏和我们中国的事情
    全国人民代表大会代表、西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞今天第一个发言。他郑重宣称：“我们西藏永远是中国的西藏，我们永远不许任何外国人干涉我们西藏和我们中国的事情！”
    班禅大师代表全体西藏僧俗人民发出这一庄严宣告的时候，全体代表立即报以经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声。会场上的激昂情绪，充分显示了我国人民维护祖国统一和民族团结的坚强意志。
    班禅额尔德尼在发言中指出，经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，无论同达赖喇嘛平时的言行或者同达赖喇嘛给中央代理代表谭冠三的三封亲笔信对照看来，都是毫无共同之处的。声明的口吻既不是达赖喇嘛本人的口吻，也不是我们藏人所习用的口吻。很显然，这个所谓声明，是外国人强加于达赖喇嘛的。
    班禅额尔德尼严厉驳斥了这个所谓“声明”把西藏人不同于汉人作为“独立”借口的荒谬论点。他指出，西藏地方在十三世纪的时候就正式加入中国版图，从此以后，西藏就一直是中国领土不可分割的一部分。西藏人民根据切身的经验懂得：脱离祖国的必然结果，并不是什么西藏的“独立”，而是把西藏变作外国的殖民地和保护国。在英国侵略者及其走狗的毒手之下，前辈班禅被迫出走了，热振活佛被残杀了，格达活佛被毒死了，达赖喇嘛的父亲也被毒死了。这些就是所谓“西藏独立”给我们的血的教训。现在有些印度人又在说什么“西藏独立”，或者说什么“承认中国的宗主权，但是不许中国干涉西藏内政”。班禅额尔德尼说，试问这些印度人：中国的事情为什么中国管不得，别人反而管得呢？这和英国人以前讲的话有什么分别呢？
    班禅额尔德尼指出，多年来遭受过外国侵略的西藏人民的眼睛是雪亮的，谁是朋友、谁是敌人，他们能够清楚地分辨出来。任何帝国主义和外国反动派，不管怎样巧加打扮都是骗不了人的。
    班禅额尔德尼最后说，西藏叛乱分子制造“独立”的阴谋已经破产了。这些叛乱分子在他们的外国主子的指使下，假借达赖喇嘛的名义从事分裂祖国的活动，是完全无济于事的。他说，现在西藏自治区筹备委员会已经行使了西藏地方政府的职权。在达赖喇嘛被劫持期间，他遵照国务院命令代理主任委员的职务，他表示决心在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，团结西藏全体干部和僧俗人民，努力完成国家和人民交付给他的光荣使命。他衷心希望达赖喇嘛能够摆脱被劫持的处境，回到祖国的怀抱来，同西藏人民一道，共同建设光明幸福的新西藏。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美以自己的亲身经历，彻底揭穿了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中污蔑中央人民政府逼迫他们签订协议和破坏协议的谎言
    全国人民代表大会代表、西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美在发言中指出，西藏原地方政府和上层反动集团纠集叛匪发动叛乱，是为了实现他们投靠帝国主义和永远奴役西藏人民的可耻目的。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美是1951年同中央人民政府谈判和签订和平解放西藏办法十七条协议的西藏地方政府首席全权代表。他以自己的亲身经历，彻底揭穿了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中污蔑中央人民政府逼迫他们签订协议和破坏协议的谎言。他说，和平解放西藏的十七条协议，是与中央全权代表在亲切友好的基础上，经过详细讨论，取得双方都满意的一致意见以后签订的。协议签订以后，为巩固国防而进入西藏的人民解放军和工作人员，一贯认真遵守执行协议和民族平等团结的政策，并且取得了显著的成绩。这是西藏人民的亲身体验所证实了的。但是，西藏原地方政府和上层反动集团却一直勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，阻挠执行这一协议。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美是西藏叛乱分子发动武装叛乱的目击者，并且在叛乱开始以后为谭冠三将军和达赖喇嘛转递信件，他今天在会上揭露的叛乱经过，彻底戳穿了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的造谣。他说，3月10日叛乱发生以后，为了帮助达赖喇嘛，中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三将军前后给达赖喇嘛写了三封信，其中两封还是由他亲自转的。达赖喇嘛也通过他转了亲笔写的三封回信。在信中写着达赖喇嘛在受叛匪种种胁迫的详细情况。果然到3月17日晚间，达赖喇嘛被叛匪劫持而去。以后到3月20日清晨三点四十分钟开始，叛匪就向在拉萨的人民解放军各部队和中央派驻西藏的机关实行武装进攻。为了保卫祖国的统一和西藏人民的安全，人民解放军不得不在3月20日当天上午北京时间十点钟开始予以反击。在西藏广大人民的竭诚支援下，在很短的时间内平息了拉萨地区的叛乱。在这以前，人民解放军从未放过一粒子弹，这是拉萨市的全体僧俗人民可以证明的。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说，自从达赖喇嘛亲政后，我与达赖喇嘛形影相随。达赖喇嘛八年来无论公开讲话，或者对藏族官员的私下谈话，我们都没有听到他说过“西藏独立”、分裂祖国统一的话。完全可以断定，这次在印度以达赖喇嘛的名义所发表的声明，绝非出自达赖喇嘛的意愿。阿沛·阿旺晋美说：“我想当达赖喇嘛静坐深思的时候，会感觉被人劫持和利用的痛苦，从而会找出摆脱被劫持的正确措置和办法。”
    李济深指出，我们非常珍贵中印两国之间的友谊，但是，我们绝不能让印度扩张主义分子利用这种友谊作为干涉中国内政的盾牌
    全国人民代表大会代表、中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深，在发言中驳斥了最近印度某些所谓“政治家”公开发表的荒谬言论，谴责了印度扩张主义分子干涉中国内政的行为。他说，印度的某些政治家，竟然对西藏少数上层反动分子的叛乱表示很大的“热心”。他们一方面说什么“印度承认中国对西藏的宗主权”，一方面把西藏上层反动分子的叛乱说成是“西藏爱国情绪的流露”，对叛乱分子表示“同情”，对我国平定西藏叛乱表示“不安”。
    李济深严正地责问道：西藏反动集团干的是背叛祖国的勾当，怎能说是“爱国情绪的流露”呢？是不是说这些话的人认为，反对中国中央人民政府并且从中国分裂出去，就是爱国呢？如果是这样的话，那末，他们爱的是那一国呢？是中国？还是印度？如果他们的叛乱和印度的扩张主义者没有瓜葛，那末印度的一些政治家为什么那样同情西藏反动集团的叛国罪行呢？为什么噶伦堡能够长期作为这些叛乱分子在国外的活动中心呢？为什么所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”会由印度外交官员散发呢？
    李济深指出，所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”公开打出了所谓西藏独立的旗号，不但充分地说明了西藏叛乱分子所追求的根本不是自治，而且更重要的是说明了印度的扩张主义分子头脑发热了。他们把这些天来中国方面以中印友好关系为重，表现了最大的克制，看作是软弱可欺的表现。这些扩张主义分子的野心真不小，他们简直要把西藏变为他们的殖民地或者保护国了。
    李济深最后着重指出，美帝国主义还霸占我国的台湾，现在又有人要把我国的西藏当作他们的势力范围。但是，今天的中国已不是清朝、北洋军阀和国民党反动统治的中国了。台湾我们是一定要解放的，西藏我们也决不能允许任何外人干涉。任何外人对于西藏武装叛乱分子的支持，都是对中国内政的干预，侵犯中国的主权，是我们六亿多中国人民决不容许的。他说，我们非常珍贵中印两国之间的友谊，不论过去、现在和将来，我们都为巩固和发展这种友谊而努力。但是，我们也绝不能让扩张主义分子利用这种友谊作为他们干涉中国内政的盾牌。这些扩张主义分子最好把头脑放清醒些，中国任人欺侮的时代已经一去不复返了。要继承英帝国主义侵略西藏的遗产，是不行的。
    沈钧儒提出直率的忠告，印度扩张主义分子干涉中国内政的行为正败坏着印度在国际事务中的声誉
    全国人民代表大会代表、中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒在发言中指出，西藏上层反动集团所以胆敢发动叛乱，是因为他们得到了帝国主义、台湾蒋匪帮和印度扩张主义分子的支持。他说，帝国主义和台湾蒋匪帮进行破坏我国统一的阴谋，这是我们预料中的，但是我们没有想到，在印度也竟然有些人支持西藏的一小撮叛国分子把西藏从中国分裂出去的罪恶活动。
    沈钧儒说，印度和中国有着悠久的传统友谊，中印两国所倡导的和平共处五项原则已被越来越多的国家公认为处理国际事务的准则，但是，在这次西藏叛乱发生后，许多口吻同帝国主义一样的对中国的诬蔑，对西藏叛乱集团的所谓同情和鼓励，竟然大量见诸于印度的报刊，出诸于某些印度政治家的议论和声明中，最近竟然由印度政府官员散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这难道是符合中印两国友好关系的利益的吗？这难道是符合印度政府所倡导的五项原则的吗？这难道是够朋友的吗？
    沈钧儒对印度扩张主义分子干涉中国内政的行为表示了强烈的愤慨和谴责。他说，现在印度某些政治家的行为正败坏着印度这些年来在国际事务中所赢得的声誉。这种情况继续发展下去，就很难使它跟英帝国主义者过去在西藏的侵略行径加以区别。作为印度的朋友，在这紧要的关头，提出直率的忠告，我认为是必要的。
    黄炎培提醒某些印度人士注意，在印度进行反对中国的政治活动，受损害的是印度的利益，高兴的只是殖民主义者
    全国人民代表大会代表、中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培说，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这是全世界包括印度在内所公认的。西藏反动分子的叛乱和这一叛乱的平定是中国的内政，任何外国不能干涉。
    黄炎培对经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”表示十分愤慨。他严正地责问道：这样一个公开攻击中国政府的政治性文件，难道印度官方事先不知道吗？
    黄炎培说，长时期以来，西藏反动分子以印度的噶伦堡作为在外国的阴谋活动的中心，西藏叛乱事件发生后，西藏叛乱分子逃到印度，受到殷勤招待和热烈欢迎，并且在印度掀起一片要求所谓西藏“独立”的叫嚣，现在竟能通过印度官方散发这样荒谬的文件。从这一系列的事实中，难道能够找得出有一丝一毫合于和平共处五项原则的地方吗？尼赫鲁总理不是说过，不允许在印度进行反对另一个国家的政治活动吗？上述种种反对中国的政治活动，难道是一个对中国友好的国家所能容许的吗？
    黄炎培郑重地指出：我愿意提醒印度人士注意，如果易地而处，如果印度的这一个或者那一个邻国把他们国家的地方作为反对印度的国外活动中心，要把印度的这一邦那一省分裂出去，请问，印度的人民和政府能容忍吗？在这样一个关系到“五项原则”、关系到中印两国友好关系的严重问题上，如果沿着错误的方向走下去，受损害的只是素以提倡和平共处著称的印度的利益，而高兴的只是殖民主义者。
    曾在西藏住了二十七年的阿旺嘉错说，西藏上层反动分子双手染满西藏人民的鲜血，是西藏人民真正的敌人
    全国人民代表大会代表、中国佛教协会副会长、四川省甘孜藏族自治州副州长阿旺嘉错在西藏居住了二十七年，作过拉萨色拉寺的堪布，他亲眼看到过西藏上层反动集团的所作所为。他今天在发言中指出：一小撮西藏叛国分子长期以来，一直就进行着勾结帝国主义和外国反动派破坏祖国的阴谋活动，叫喊“保护民族利益”的西藏上层反动分子，双手早已染满了西藏人民的鲜血，他们横征暴敛，杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，无恶不作。他们还豢养藏军，遍设监狱，采用挖眼、割鼻、扒心、剥皮等等酷刑镇压人民。阿旺嘉错说：广大西藏人民从历史事实中清楚地知道，正是这些叫喊“保护民族利益”的反动统治者，是西藏人民真正的敌人。
    阿旺嘉错接着指出：“保护宗教”是西藏叛国分子打出的另一个旗帜，他们伪装成虔诚的佛教徒，掩饰他们的罪恶活动。阿旺嘉错说：我亲身领教过他们玩耍宗教的把戏。当他们需要利用宗教名义来干什么罪恶勾当时，就召集色拉寺等西藏三大寺的堪布开会，把他们的意志强加在喇嘛群众的身上，然后就以三大寺的名义去欺骗群众，强迫喇嘛违背教规去干打仗杀人的罪行。
    阿旺嘉错揭露了西藏上层反动集团为了勾结帝国主义而杀害活佛的罪行。他说：1947年由于西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义，遭到反帝爱国的原藏王热振活佛的反对，索康·旺清格勒和拉鲁等人，竟带兵捉住热振活佛，用残酷的刑罚将他活活害死。热振活佛下属的三大活佛和许多喇嘛，有的下狱，有的流放，也通统遭到迫害。阿旺嘉错说：我自己也是因此而逃到内地的。我逃出后，他们还通令悬重赏要砍我的头，后来竟将我胞弟茨烈嘉错杀死，把他的头说成是我的头，说我已被他们杀死，而大肆宣传。他说：因为热振事件，西藏上层反动分子还领兵攻打色拉寺，寺内善良无辜的喇嘛被打死、打伤的近一百人。色拉寺所辖十三个孔村，被他们抢掠一空。阿旺嘉错指出：1950年爱国的格达活佛为了和平解放西藏到达昌都的时候，就是被西藏上层反动分子和英国特务福特放毒药害死的。
    阿旺嘉错说：试问，这一切难道就是所谓“保护宗教”吗？这难道是虔诚的佛教徒应有的行为吗？西藏上层反动集团是背叛祖国、背叛民族利益、背叛佛教教义的罪人。他们的特点是：无耻、毫无人性，在他们身上找不到一点正直的人应该具有的东西。
