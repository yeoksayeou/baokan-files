Chairman, fellow delegates:
    I enthusiastically endorse Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference."
    I am an educator working at Dalian Institute of Technology. Now, in connection with the situation at our school, I would like to share my personal observations on education.
    Our school was established in 1949. Over the past decade, it has undergone a development process from nothing to something, from small to large. It can truly be said that we have built a tall building from the ground up. It has rapidly grown into a socialist-scale higher industrial school. This is, of course, just one of the countless achievements of the Party's leadership in national education over the past decade. It should be particularly mentioned that the past year has seen especially rapid development and growth. Through the great rectification movement and educational revolution, the school has achieved rapid development in strengthening Party leadership, in ideology, in school size, in professional settings, in teaching quality, in the construction of labor bases, and in scientific research achievements. This can be described as a leap forward; such a leap forward would have been inconceivable using past standards. The reason we have achieved such a great leap forward is the result of Party leadership, the implementation of the Party's education policy, and the result of breaking down superstitions, liberating our minds, and launching mass movements.
    Although the Party has consistently and comprehensively led the school forward since its establishment, the Party's leadership has been unprecedentedly consolidated through the rectification movement. Recalling the early stages of the rectification movement, bourgeois rightists stirred up trouble, and many middle-of-the-road elements lacked a correct understanding of the Party's leadership over education. Therefore, the Party's leadership over the broad masses of middle-of-the-road elements was not very solid. After the rectification and anti-rightist campaign and the educational revolution, not only was the rightists' attack politically defeated and the political direction corrected, but also through the criticism of bourgeois individualism, educational thought, and academic viewpoints, and through physical labor and practical work, the political consciousness of teachers and students was greatly improved, and the implementation of the Party's education policy had a foundation and impetus. Therefore, the school's leap forward situation naturally unfolded.
    Like other schools, we have included productive labor in the formal curriculum, which is a historically significant change in education. Teachers and students used to be detached from productive practice, not engaged in physical labor, and schools were all consumption units of society. After a year of labor, this situation has been fundamentally changed. In addition to participating in local production and construction tasks, the school's teachers and students have transformed the single mechanical practice factory into fifteen factories that have been rectified and consolidated, capable of accommodating one thousand students to participate in labor regularly.
    The most important result of the labor course lies in the changes in the thoughts and feelings of teachers and students. In the past, many people disliked labor and looked down on the working people, but now they have begun to get used to and love labor. In the past, everyone did not participate in social production, but now they have begun to care about production. Once, a student's father came to the school from the countryside to visit him. The son disliked his father for being "uncultured" and not dressed decently. He was embarrassed to recognize his father in front of his classmates, claiming that he was someone who brought a letter from his hometown. Now, when students wear clothes stained with mud or oil on the street, they not only don't feel ashamed but feel very proud that they are returning from the labor site.
    Through labor, students' political and ideological awareness has been greatly improved, and the communist spirit and character are growing. Most students have clarified the path of becoming both red and expert. Studying politics, striving for progress, and caring for the collective have become the norm. In December last year, our institute allocated 14,000 yuan in subsidies to solve the living difficulties of some students, but it took a long time to distribute the money because everyone was helping and giving way to each other, saying that they could overcome the difficulties. After repeated mobilization and persuasion, it was finally distributed.
    In terms of physical strength and health, after participating in labor, the physical condition has generally improved, and various diseases have significantly decreased. Recently, at the Dalian-Lushun Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, a statistic was mentioned that after participating in labor, 50% of the students in a certain grade gained 3 kilograms in weight, and the most gained 10 kilograms. In the labor and defense system exercises, six of the nine colleges and universities in Dalian-Lushun achieved 100% pass rate, and the physical condition of young students is generally stronger than before.
    Generally speaking, there is almost unanimous recognition of the improvement of labor courses in terms of moral and physical education. The estimated impact on intellectual education has caused some different views. It should be considered that, even based on the observation of the past short period of time, teachers and students have participated in labor, contacted productive practice, gained direct experience, and obtained more complete knowledge, so the quality of knowledge and the ability to solve practical problems have been significantly improved. For example, second-year students in the Mechanical Engineering Department have been able to manufacture two lathes, which lays a solid foundation for their future study of lathe professional courses. For another example, students from the Hydraulic Engineering Department have traveled to various places and done a lot of specific work for the water conservancy of Liaoning Province. Undoubtedly, the gains in professional knowledge are by no means as specific and profound as classroom learning alone. Participating in productive labor has inspired teachers' and students' observation abilities and creative desires. Scientific research is no longer mysterious, nor is it a matter for a few experts. Just in these few days, our school is holding a series of mass scientific discussion meetings to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the school, with fruitful results and a vibrant atmosphere. This shows that through the educational revolution, teachers' practical knowledge of production has been supplemented, scientific research has been found, and students' ability to understand, think, and use theoretical research problems has been improved.
    Therefore, due to the initial implementation of the Party's education policy, the school's education quality, whether in moral, intellectual, or physical education, has been significantly improved.
    Of course, last year, due to a lack of experience in implementing the Party's education policy, there were also some shortcomings, but these are negligible compared with the achievements and can be completely compensated for in future work.
    There was such an opinion that the school spent too much time participating in labor last year, which affected the progress of the curriculum. It is true that the labor time was long, but a specific analysis must be made. It must be seen that the participation of teachers and students in labor is a major event that changes the separation of mental and physical labor for thousands of years. It is entirely necessary for the labor time to be slightly longer. Secondly, last year's participation in the glorious labor for steel, as well as the labor to support the great leap forward in industry and agriculture such as drought resistance, deep plowing, and electrification, were all historically significant events. These labors greatly improved the awareness of teachers and students, established a connection between school education and national political tasks, industrial and agricultural production and construction, and established a connection between intellectuals and workers and peasants. Although some courses were missed, it was completely worthwhile.
    Some teachers and students once showed a phenomenon of neglecting theory after participating in labor, thinking that since labor is emphasized, theoretical knowledge does not seem to be important. This is of course a delusion and should be corrected. This year, the school party committee put forward the slogan "Study and Labor Together" and made appropriate arrangements to strengthen teaching, especially to strengthen theoretical foundation courses. This problem has basically been solved. Now, attention should be paid to the possibility of another tendency to neglect labor among teachers and students after emphasizing teaching, although there is no sign of this yet.
    In short, less than a year of experience has made me realize the correctness and greatness of the Party's education policy. A vast contingent of working-class intellectuals with culture and socialist consciousness is being formed under the guidance of this policy.
    In such a glorious era, it is glorious to be a people's teacher. In the new teacher-student relationship that has begun to form, under the principle of teaching and learning from each other, we teachers should take responsibility and play a leading role in teaching. This is the trust and sacred responsibility given to us by the Party and the country. We must, under the leadership of the Party, enthusiastically, actively, and boldly take on our work and play every role we can. To this end, we must first strengthen our self-transformation and constantly improve academically, and accelerate our progress towards the goal of being both red and expert. At the same time, we earnestly hope that the younger generation will far surpass ourselves. Let the old and new comrades teach and learn from each other, and let the Party's education policy forever shine brightly!

    教育和生产劳动结合  德育智育和体育并进
    钱令希委员谈大连工学院一年来的成就主席、各位委员：
    我热烈拥护周总理的“政府工作报告”和李维汉副主席的“中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”。
    我是一个教育工作者，岗位是在大连工学院。现在联系我们学校的情况，对教育事业谈谈个人的观感。
    我们学校是一九四九年成立的。十年来经历了一个从无到有、从小到大的发展过程。真可谓是平地起高楼，它迅速地成长为一个具有社会主义规模的高等工业学校。这当然仅仅是党十年来领导全国教育事业的无数成绩之中的一个而已。应该特别提到，去年一年，发展和壮大是特别迅速的。通过伟大的整风运动和教育革命，学校无论在加强党的领导上、在思想上、在学校规模上、在专业设置上、在教学质量上、在劳动基地的建设上、在科学研究的成绩上都取得了飞速的发展。这不能不说是一个跃进，这样的跃进用过去的尺度来衡量，是不可思议的。我们之所以取得这样大的跃进，是党领导的结果，是贯彻了党的教育方针的结果，是破除迷信、解放思想大搞群众运动的结果。
    虽然，从学校成立以来，党是一贯全面地领导着学校前进的。但是通过整风运动，党的领导空前地巩固了。回忆整风初期，资产阶级右派兴风作浪，不少中间分子对于党对教育工作的领导缺乏正确认识，因此党对广大中间分子的领导曾经是不很巩固的。经过整风反右和教育革命，不仅从政治上打垮了右派分子的进攻，端正了政治方向，同时通过对资产阶级个人主义、教育思想和学术观点的批判，又经过体力劳动和实际工作的锻炼，大大的提高了师生的政治觉悟，党的教育方针的贯彻有了基础和动力，因此学校跃进的局面就很自然地展开了。
    和其他学校一样，我们已经把生产劳动列入正式课程，这是教育工作上一个有历史意义的变革。从来教师和学生脱离生产实际，不从事体力劳动，学校都是社会的消费单位。经过一年的劳动，这种局面便从根本上改变了。学校师生除了参加地方各项生产建设任务之外，在校内也已从只有一个机械实习工厂，到现在拥有十五个经过整顿巩固了的工厂，可以容纳一千名同学经常参加劳动。
    劳动课程的最主要成果还在于师生思想感情上的变化。过去不少人厌恶劳动，轻视劳动人民，而现在开始习惯并爱起劳动来了。过去大家不参与社会生产，而现在开始关心生产了。曾经有个学生的父亲从农村来学校探望他，儿子嫌父亲“土”、穿得不体面，在同学面前不好意思认父亲，推说是个从家乡带信来的人。现在呢，同学们在街上穿了沾满泥土或油污的衣服，不但不觉得难看，反而觉得自己是从劳动工地回来，心里非常自豪。
    通过劳动，学生的政治思想觉悟有了很大的提高，共产主义精神品貌正在成长，大多数同学明确了走又红又专的道路，学习政治、要求进步、关心集体已成风气。我院去年十二月为解决部分学生生活困难拨了一万四千元补助费，但是发了很久发不下去，大家互助互让，表示可以克服困难。经过再三动员说服，才分配了下去。
    在体力和健康方面，参加劳动以后，体质普遍增强，各种疾病显著减少了。最近在旅大市政协大会上提到一个统计数字，说某一个年级学生在参加劳动后，体重增加三公斤的达百分之五十，最多的有增加达十公斤的。劳卫制锻炼，旅大市九所大专学校有六所百分之百地通过了，青年同学们的体格普遍地比以前强壮了。
    一般说来，关于劳动课对于德育体育方面的提高，认识几乎是一致的。曾经有些不同看法的是智育方面的估计。应该认为，即使根据过去很短一段时间的观察，教师和学生参加了劳动，接触了生产实际，取得了直接经验，获得比较完全的知识，因此知识质量和解决实际问题的能力有显著提高。例如机械系二年级的学生就已能制造出两部车床，这对于以后他们学车床的专业课打下多么坚实的基础。又例如水利系同学奔波各地，为辽宁省水利化做了很多具体工作，无疑在专业知识方面的收获，决不是单靠课堂学习可以如此具体而深刻的。参加了生产劳动，启发了师生对于事物的观察能力和创造愿望，科学研究不再是神秘，也不再是少数专家的事情了。就在这几天，我们学校正在为庆祝十周年校庆而举行着一系列群众性的科学讨论会，成果累累，满园春色。这说明通过教育革命，教师们的生产实际知识得到了补充，科学研究就有了门路，而学生们的理解、思考和运用理论研究问题的能力都提高了。
    因此，由于初步贯彻了党的教育方针，学校的教育质量，不论德育、智育、体育都有显著的提高。
    当然，去年由于贯彻党的教育方针还缺乏经验，也存在着一些缺点，但这和成绩相比是微乎其微的，并且完全可以在今后工作中加以弥补的。
    有过这样一种意见：认为去年学校参加劳动的时间多了一些，影响了课程的进度。劳动时间多是事实，但要做具体的分析。必须看到师生参加劳动，是改变几千年来劳心和劳力分离状态的大事，劳动时间稍微多一些，是完全必要的。其次，去年参加了为钢铁而战的光荣劳动，以及参加了抗旱、深翻地、办电等支援工农业大跃进的劳动都是具有历史意义的大事。这些劳动使师生觉悟有很大提高，使学校教育和国家政治任务，工农业生产建设建立了联系，使知识分子和工农群众建立了联系。虽然少上了些课程，是完全值得的。
    有的师生在参加劳动之后，一度出现忽视理论的现象，以为既然强调劳动，似乎理论知识就不重要了。这当然是一种错觉，应该加以纠正的。今年学校党委提出了“又要读书、又要劳动”的口号，并为加强教学，特别是加强理论基础课程作了妥善的安排。这问题基本上也就解决了。现在倒要注意在强调教学之后，在教师和学生之中产生忽视劳动的另一种倾向的可能性，虽然现在还没有这种迹象。
    总之，短短不到一年的经历，使我体会到党的教育方针的正确和伟大，一支广大的有文化、有社会主义觉悟的工人阶级知识分子队伍，正在这个方针的指导之下形成起来。
    在这样光辉的时代中，作为一个人民教师是光荣的。在已经开始形成的新的师生关系中，在教学相长的原则下，我们教师应该负起责任，起到教学上的主导作用，这是党和国家赋予我们的信任和神圣职责。我们必须在党的领导下，热情地、积极地、大胆地担负起工作来，发挥自己能尽的一切作用。为此，我们必须首先加强自我改造，并在学术上不断提高，向又红又专的目标加速前进。同时我们殷切盼望青年一代还要远远胜过自己。让新老同志，教学相长，党的教育方针永远发出灿烂的光芒！
