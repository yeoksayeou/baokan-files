From Fourteenth to Fourth
　　——Recording the Struggle of Xia Liushi People's Commune in Hengshan County, Hunan to Change its Backward Appearance
　　Yang Dejia
　　In early March, when Hengshan County, Hunan Province, announced the results of the February evaluation of all communes in the county, the name "Xia Liushi People's Commune" appeared in the "Ox-Cart" column, indicating relatively poor performance. In January, Xia Liushi Commune ranked eleventh among the seventeen communes in the county; this time, its fertilizer accumulation and overall work had dropped to fourteenth place.

　　The Commander's Heart
　　It was late at night. Comrades from various communes who attended the county-level cadre meeting had mostly fallen asleep peacefully. In the room where the comrades from Xia Liushi Commune were staying, the lights were still on. People were using their rest time to write letters to the comrades left at home in the commune and brigades to manage the work. In the past two days, they had been calling and writing letters to their comrades at home almost every day; some people had even written two letters in a single day.

　　The most anxious was Bin Guifang, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee. That night, he hardly slept at all. He thought: The Shaquan Commune and Nan Yue Commune have filled their fertilizer ponds, and their plowing and harrowing work is also done well, so why can't Xia Liushi Commune do it well? It is true that Xia Liushi Commune has more fields but less labor, and the natural conditions are poor; but can't the conditions be changed? Suddenly, he thought of Nan Yue Commune: this commune was also ranked fourteenth last month, but because they worked hard to catch up, they finally rose to fourth place this month. This matter gave him the greatest encouragement, and the determination and confidence to catch up with the advanced replaced the painful and anxious mood. In order to save time, he decided to ask the county party committee for one night's leave the next day to rush back to the commune to hold an emergency telephone conference.

　　A Mass Mobilization of the Whole People
　　The next night, shortly after eleven o'clock, an emergency telephone conference was held. Bin Guifang's voice came through the phone: This time, the evaluation showed that Xia Liushi Commune had dropped from eleventh to fourteenth place. If we continue like this, next month we will be seventeenth place - the last place! Everyone, tell me: Is Xia Liushi People's Commune willing to lag behind? If we are not willing to lag behind, what should we do? ... These short sentences stirred the hearts of everyone. This telephone conference was held in a compact and enthusiastic manner, measures were studied, resolutions were expressed, and a high-spirited fighting spirit was aroused.

　　Although it was already nearly one o'clock, the various brigades still held cadre meetings overnight. The next day, mass meetings were also held. Leading cadres did not conceal their shortcomings, but instead handed over the shortcomings and problems to the masses for discussion and resolution. Some leading cadres of the Lingcha Brigade previously emphasized objective difficulties such as the large size of the team, many fields but less labor, and insufficient water sources, which slowed down the progress of production, ranking last among the sixteen production brigades in the entire commune. This time, they were criticized at the branch committee and party member meetings. Subsequently, they also launched a "two-speak" (speaking about the commune ranking fourteenth in the county, speaking about the brigade ranking sixteenth in the commune) "two-check" (leading cadres check their own shortcomings, mobilize the masses to check the problems existing in current production), and "two-offer" (offer strength and offer ideas) campaign among the masses. On this basis, they also launched a mass debate around the issues of "Can the backward appearance be changed?", "Is everyone willing to lag behind?", and "What should we do if we are not willing to lag behind?". Through the debate, the masses were in high spirits, and they put forward the heroic slogan of "Fight hard for a month, change the appearance, catch up with the advanced, and win glory for the commune." The enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses were greatly developed.

　　The Battle Begins
　　The emergency telephone conference and the subsequent mass debate have tightly integrated the hearts of all commanders and fighters. The will of tens of thousands of people has become one will: to change the backward appearance! The Lingcha Brigade, which was originally the most backward in production, has been completely renewed. The number of workers increased from 40% of the total population to 75%. Young people and adults used carts and baskets to transport fertilizer to the fields. Yuan Guihua, a female cook in the second team's canteen, in addition to being responsible for cooking for sixty-seven people, also shoveled 150 loads of turf every day. All eight hundred acres of slab fields in the entire brigade were cleared within four days.

　　Active on the front lines of production are also the commanders of the commune and brigades. They are both propagandists, commanders, and fighters. Zhao Yonglong, the captain of Baiqiao Brigade, had his hand swollen due to a fall on a slippery road, but he refused to rest and went to the fields every day. Old man Yang Yiyou, from the Paixing production team of Xiangzi Brigade, was the earliest person to get up every day; these days, he has fallen behind. Yang Yiyou gets up every day before dawn; however, Li Yangsheng, a member of the Commune Party Committee and Secretary of the Brigade General Branch, has already picked up a basket of wild manure from the fields.

　　Hard Work Plus Smart Work
　　The intense battle is continuing. Many cadres have been working hard continuously, and the enthusiasm of the masses is also full. In order to maintain the enthusiasm and combat effectiveness of the masses, the Commune Party Committee issued a call: Hard work must be combined with smart work.

　　Immediately, a tool reform movement centered on the mechanization of fertilizer transportation was launched. Within a few days, nearly three thousand carts were repaired and newly built throughout the commune. With carts available, what to do about the shortage of cart baskets? The masses donated unused cradles, carrying boxes, old-fashioned cages, and so on. By changing from manual fertilizer carrying to cart transportation, the efficiency was generally increased by two times.

　　The masses had many inventions. The Sancai Brigade promoted the method of using dry boats to deliver fertilizer in the large fields, which could increase efficiency by four or five times. When preparing moist rice seedling fields, the major brigades created various "leveling seedling field frames," which also greatly increased efficiency and greatly reduced the labor intensity of the people.

　　Victory
　　After a month of hard work, the appearance of Xia Liushi Commune has undergone significant changes. All 70,000 acres of rice paddies in the entire commune have achieved "every field full of embankments, every embankment full of fertilizer," with an average of 650 loads of fertilizer accumulated per acre. Work such as seed soaking and seedling cultivation, plowing and harrowing, spring planting, animal husbandry, and aquaculture has also been developed. The originally most backward Lingcha Brigade has also basically caught up. At the end of March, in the evaluation of all communes in the county, Xia Liushi Commune had leaped from fourteenth place to fourth place. Yanglin, Caoshi, and other communes with much better natural conditions than Xia Liushi Commune had fallen behind Xia Liushi Commune.

　　During the mass debate, some people were still convinced in word but not in heart, believing that it was unlikely to change the backward appearance. Now, in the face of the facts, they are also convinced and admit defeat. They said: "Falling behind is not scary; poor conditions are not scary. The most scary thing is the lack of drive and the lack of determination to strive for progress in the face of difficulties."

　　从第十四到第四
　　——记湖南衡山县霞流市公社改变后进面貌的斗争
　　杨德嘉
    3月初，湖南衡山县公布全县各个公社2月份评比的结果时，在表示工作比较落后的“牛拉车”栏内，有着“霞流市人民公社”的名字。1月份，霞流市公社在全县十七个公社中站在第十一名；这次，积肥和全面工作都降到第十四名了。
    指挥员的心
    夜深了。各公社参加全县干部会议的同志们，大都已经安然入睡。霞流市公社的同志们居住的房间里，仍然点着灯光。人们在利用休息的时间，给公社、大队留在家里掌握工作的同志们写信。这两天，他们几乎每天都在给家里的同志打电话，去信，有的人甚至一天就写了两封信。
    最焦急的，还是公社党委第一书记宾桂芳。这一晚，他几乎根本没有睡着觉。他想：沙泉公社、南岳公社积肥满氹，犁耙工夫也都搞得好，为什么霞流市公社就搞不好呢？霞流市公社田多劳力少，自然条件差，这是事实；但是，条件难道就不能改变吗？突然，他想起了南岳公社：这个公社上个月也是站在第十四名，由于他们猛追猛赶，这个月终于站到了第四名。这件事给了他最大的鼓舞，赶上先进的决心、信心代替了沉痛、焦急的心情。为了抢时间，他决定第二天向县委请一晚上的假，赶回公社去开一个紧急的电话会议。
    全民大动员
    第二天晚上十一点多钟，紧急电话会议召开了。电话里传来了宾桂芳的声音：这次评比霞流市公社由第十一名降到第十四名了，再这样下去，下个月就会是第十七名——最末一名了；你们大家说：霞流市公社甘不甘心落后？不甘心落后怎么办？……短短几句话，激动了每一个人的心。这个电话会开得紧凑、热烈，研究了措施，表示了决心，激起了昂扬的斗志。
    虽然已经近一点钟了，各个大队还是连夜召开了干部会议。第二天，又都召开了群众大会。领导干部没有隐瞒自己的缺点，而是把缺点、问题交给群众，让群众讨论、解决。岭茶大队部分领导干部，前段强调队大、田多劳力少、水源不足等客观困难，生产进度迟缓，在全公社十六个生产大队中排居最末一名。这次，在支委会、党员会上受到了批评。随后，他们又在群众中开展了“两讲”（讲公社在全县站第十四名、讲大队在公社中站第十六名）“两检”（领导干部检查自己的缺点，发动群众检查当前生产中存在的问题）、“两献”（献力献计）运动。在这个基础上，又围绕着“落后面貌能不能改变”、“大家甘不甘心落后”、“不甘心落后怎么办”等问题，开展了全民性的鸣放辩论。通过辩论，群众斗志昂扬，他们提出了“苦战一个月，改变面貌，猛追先进，为公社争光”的豪迈口号。群众的积极性、智慧大大发扬了。
    战斗开始了
    紧急电话会议和随后进行的全民大辩论，使全体指挥员、战斗员的心紧紧地融合在一起了。几万个人的意志变成了一个意志：改变后进面貌！原来生产最落后的岭茶大队，面貌焕然一新。出工人数由占总人口的40％增加到75％。青年人、壮年人用车子、用谷箩送肥料下田。二队食堂女炊事员袁桂华，除了负责煮六十七个人的饭菜外，每天还铲草皮一百五十担。全大队八百来亩板田，四天之内就突击消灭了。
    活跃在生产最前线的，还有公社、大队的指挥员。他们既是宣传员、指挥员，又是战斗员。柏桥大队队长赵雍龙，由于天雨路滑把手跌肿了，可是他还不肯休息，天天到田里去。老倌子杨义有，是巷子大队排形生产队每天起床最早的人；这几天，他落后了。每天天还没亮，杨义有就起床；可是，公社党委委员、大队总支书记李扬生同志，已从野外拣回一箢箕野粪了。
    苦干加巧干
    紧张的战斗在持续地进行着。很多干部连续苦战，群众的干劲也十足。为了保持群众的积极性和战斗力，公社党委发出了号召：苦干还要加巧干。
    随即，一个以运肥车子化为中心的工具改革运动开展起来了。几天之内，全公社整修新修的车子近三千部。车子有了，车箢不足怎么办？群众把不用的摇篮、挑箱、旧式笼子等都献出来了。由人工挑肥改为车子运肥，工效普遍提高了两倍。
    群众的创造发明很多。三才大队推广了用旱船在大田里送肥的办法，可以提高工效四、五倍。在整理湿润秧田时，各大队创造了各种不同的“平整秧田架”，也大大提高了工效，人们的劳动强度也大大减轻了。
    胜利了
    经过苦战一个月，霞流市公社的面貌已经有了显著的改变。全公社七万多亩稻田，全部作到了“丘丘满氹，氹氹满肥”，每亩平均已积肥六百五十担。浸种育秧、犁耙工夫、春播、畜牧、水产等工作，也都有了发展。原来最落后的岭茶大队，也基本上赶了上来。在3月底，全县各公社评比结果，霞流市公社已由第十四名一跃而为第四名。自然条件比霞流市公社好得多的扬林、草市等公社，却落在霞流市公社的后面了。
    在全民大辩论中，有些人还是口服心不服，认为要改变落后面貌不大可能。现在，在事实面前，他们也心服了，认输了。他们说：“落了后，不可怕；条件差，不可怕。最可怕的是在困难面前缺乏干劲，缺乏力争上游的决心”。
