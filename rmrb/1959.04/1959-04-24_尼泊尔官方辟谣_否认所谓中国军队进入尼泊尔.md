Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd, London dispatch: The Nepalese Embassy in London on the 22nd refuted the rumor that Chinese troops had entered Nepal.

The embassy spokesperson said, "We do not believe there is any credibility to this news." He said that there have been many such rumors recently.

The embassy spokesperson made the above statement in response to a report published by the British "News Chronicle" on the 22nd alleging that Chinese troops had entered Nepal.

Nepal's "Motherland Daily" also published such rumors on the 21st. This newspaper also fabricated stories, saying that Chinese troops broke into several houses, chased the people living in these houses, robbed them, etc.

According to Kathmandu news: The Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd denied the rumor that Nepal, in view of the situation in Tibet, is considering joining the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

An official communique also pointed out that a piece of news published in the newspaper, saying that the King of Nepal, Mahendra, was panicking and was trying to hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru, was groundless.

After the rebellion in Tibet, the Nepalese government issued a press release on March 26, stating that "the Tibetan incident is entirely an internal matter." The communique also stated, "As a neighboring country, the Nepalese government hopes to quickly control the situation and restore peace and order."

    尼泊尔官方辟谣
    否认所谓中国军队进入尼泊尔
    新华社23日讯　据伦敦消息：尼泊尔驻伦敦大使馆22日否认所谓中国军队进入尼泊尔的谣言。
    大使馆的发言人说，我们不认为这项消息有任何可靠之处。他说，最近有许多这一类的谣传。
    大使馆的发言人是针对英国“新闻纪事报”22日刊载的一条所谓中国军队进入尼泊尔的消息而发表上述声明的。
    尼泊尔“祖国报”在21日也曾刊载这样的谣言，这家报纸还造谣说，中国军队闯入若干所房屋，追击住在这些房屋里的人、进行抢劫等等。
    另据加德满都消息：尼泊尔外交部22日否认所谓尼泊尔鉴于西藏的局势正考虑参加“东南亚条约组织”的传说。
    官方发表的一项公报还指出报纸上所登载的一项消息是毫无根据的，这项消息说：尼泊尔国王马亨德拉感到恐慌，并且正在设法同印度总理尼赫鲁进行会谈。
    西藏发生叛乱事件后，尼泊尔政府在3月26日曾发表新闻公报说，“西藏事件完全是一个内部问题”。公报又说，“作为一个邻国，尼泊尔政府希望迅速控制这种局势和恢复和平秩序”。
