Fellow Representatives:

    I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. In 1958, under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the brilliant general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, people of all ethnic groups across the country displayed soaring enthusiasm and high intelligence, creating amazing miracles and splendid achievements, which further inspired me and strengthened my confidence in and enthusiastic support for the Party and socialism.

    Recently, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique betrayed the motherland, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement, launched an armed rebellion, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, fled to India, and sought refuge with Indian expansionists, undermining national unity and the solidarity of all ethnic groups. This filled me with extreme indignation. For more than nine years since liberation, people of all ethnic groups across the country, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, have embarked on the socialist road, while the Tibetan people are still living under a cruel and dark serf system, leading a life worse than cattle and horses. The Central People's Government has shown utmost benevolence and patience, waiting for the former Tibetan local government to awaken and giving them ample time for consideration, allowing reforms in Tibet to be slowed down. However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, remained unrepentant and continued to collude with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, attempting to rely on their strength to preserve the cruel serf system, continue to oppress and exploit the Tibetan people, and prevent them from ever escaping the shackles of serfdom, seriously violating the interests of the Tibetan people and the common interests of all ethnic groups. They not only obstructed the preparatory work for the Tibet Autonomous Region, but even blatantly launched an armed rebellion to split the motherland. This is not only forbidden by national law, but also intolerable to the 600 million people of all ethnic groups in the country. Tibet has always been part of China's territory. The so-called statement by the Dalai Lama, which even refers to a "country," cannot be found anywhere in history mentioning the name of a Tibetan country. This "statement" is truly absurd and ridiculous, and throughout the so-called statement of the Dalai Lama, one cannot find the tone of his own voice, clearly a trick orchestrated by Indian expansionists and rebels. Tibet is an integral part of our country's territory, and no one is allowed to interfere in our internal affairs. The Central People's Government's decree to dissolve the former Tibetan local government and have the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercise the functions and powers of the local government, so that Tibet can quickly realize ethnic regional autonomy and gradually carry out democratic reforms, is something I, representing the 1.6 million people of all ethnic groups in my prefecture, express warm support for.

    The Face of Dehong Area Gradually Changes, All Ethnic Groups are Unprecedentedly United

    Fellow Representatives: Our Dehong is also a place that was liberated relatively late. Before liberation, it was not only poor and backward, but also the various ethnic groups killed each other. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, through democratic reforms and socialist transformation, production has developed, people's lives have improved, and the various ethnic groups have become unprecedentedly united, gradually changing the past poor and backward appearance. I am a Dai representative from the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture on the border of the motherland. Now I will briefly report to the conference on a few situations in my prefecture since the Great Leap Forward. The ethnic minorities in our prefecture mainly live in the border counties. Last year, the relations of production leaped from the small-peasant economy to the socialist economy. In 1957, only about one-third of the farm households in the border counties participated in agricultural cooperatives. Since socialist education was carried out in the countryside, the people of all ethnic groups have had their eyes opened and their ideological awareness has been raised. Seeing the superiority of the cooperatives, they have asked to join and form cooperatives one after another. By the spring of 1958, combined with the large-scale production movement of water conservancy and manure accumulation, a high tide of joining cooperatives was set off, and in a short period of time, the number of farm households joining cooperatives exceeded 80 percent. However, the revolution is constantly moving forward. Since the Party Central Committee announced the decision to establish people's communes, the border counties of our prefecture have also urgently demanded to advance on the road to people's communes. Now, in a short period of time, people's communes have been widely established in ethnic minority areas in the border counties. The Nujiang Dam has also organized a people's commune including state-owned farms, state-owned cotton fields, and more than 35,000 people of all ethnic groups.

    Construction Undertakings are Developing Greatly

    Before liberation, there was no industry to speak of in the border areas. After liberation, with the strong help of the Party and the people's government at higher levels, it has gradually been established. Up to now, according to incomplete statistics, there are already 560 factories and mines run by counties and above, and 2,062 factories and mines run by districts, townships, and communes, with a total of 2,622 in the prefecture. Machine tools: in 1957, there were only two; in 1958, it had increased to 461. Iron: in 1957, there were only 1,037 tons; in 1958, it had increased to 14,474 tons. Steel and copper: there was no production in 1957, and in 1958, 195 tons of steel and 128 tons of crude copper were produced. Coal: in 1957, there were only 14,756 tons; in 1958, it increased to 394,500 tons. In terms of agriculture, the grain output in 1957 was 1,161.4 million catties, and the cotton output was 12,915 dan. In 1958, the grain output increased to 1,450 million catties, and the cotton output was 24,836 dan. There has also been a great leap forward in culture, education, and health. There are a total of 200,900 primary school students in the prefecture, accounting for 96.96% of school-age children. There are 11,251 middle school students and 1,246 students in secondary vocational schools and higher vocational schools. In terms of literacy, the Dai and Jingpo languages ​​are used in the main ethnic areas of the border counties. Before 1957, there were only about 50,000 people; by 1958, 395,834 people had become literate, accounting for 97.6% of the 405,573 young and middle-aged people.

    Eradicating the Seven Pests in a Land of Malaria

    The Dai areas on the border, known as a land of malaria, have long been plagued by malignant malaria, plague, dysentery, and many virulent diseases. The local people of all ethnic groups suffered from diseases, and outsiders turned pale at the mention of it. Mangshi, where the prefectural commissioner is located, was once the most feared malarial area, with a saying: "If you want to go to Mangshi Dam, marry off your wife first." After liberation, the Party and the people's government at higher levels showed special concern, constantly sending health and epidemic prevention teams to work in the border counties, establishing health and epidemic prevention institutions, and carrying out free medical care. Over the past few years, not only has the harm of diseases been fundamentally changed, but the masses have been further mobilized to eliminate rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, fleas, lice, and bed bugs. The seven pests have now been basically eliminated.

    All Achievements are Inseparable from the Leadership of the Party

    We are very clear that the brilliant achievements we have made in the socialist construction and the overall Great Leap Forward in the border ethnic minority areas are first and foremost inseparable from the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We deeply know that without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no liberation for our ethnic minorities and no prosperity and happiness today. We can only follow the Communist Party, listen to Chairman Mao, and always unite in the big family of the motherland to have a bright future.

    In addition, it should be specially explained that my prefecture is located on the national defense border of the motherland, and the struggle against the enemy is also an extremely arduous task. For more than a year, the achievements of the overall Great Leap Forward in our prefecture have not only reflected the victory of the people of all ethnic groups in marching towards nature, transforming nature, and conquering nature under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, but also reflected the victory of the struggle against the enemy. For more than a year, the remnants of the enemy outside the border have carried out a lot of rumors and sabotage on our road to the Great Leap Forward. For example, when we built water conservancy projects and dug ditches, they spread rumors that we were digging trenches; when we suppressed counter-revolutionaries, they spread rumors that the ethnic upper classes were arrested and killed. Outside the border, they even published these rumors in newspapers. Although they have done everything possible to spread rumors and slanders, these conspiracies and sabotage have been exposed, overcome, and eliminated by the people of all ethnic groups who have greatly improved their awareness and greatly united.

    The rebellion in Tibet made me deeply feel that no enemy will be willing to die. The closer they get to death, the more they will make a dying struggle and carry out more insidious activities. Therefore, we must be vigilant, especially those of us who are ethnic cadres from the upper classes, must be especially vigilant. The enemy is always looking for their agents among the upper classes of various ethnic minorities. We must firmly stand our ground and not be fooled by them. We must accelerate our transformation so as to unite with the broad masses of working people and, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, contribute more to a greater leap forward in the future.

### 把西藏称为“国家”是海外奇谈  刀京版代表的发言

专栏：

    把西藏称为“国家”是海外奇谈
    刀京版代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。一九五八年全国各族人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，发挥了冲天干劲和高度智慧，创造惊人的奇迹和辉煌的成就，更鼓舞了我，增强了我对党、对社会主义的信心和热烈拥护。
    最近原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，背叛祖国，撕毁了十七条协议，发动武装叛乱，劫走达赖喇嘛，逃到印度，投靠印度扩张主义分子，破坏国家统一和各民族团结，使我感到极大的愤慨。解放九年多来，全国各族人民在党和毛主席领导下，已走上了社会主义的大道，而西藏人民则尚处于残酷的黑暗的农奴制度下，过着牛马生活。中央人民政府仁至义尽地耐心地等待原西藏地方政府自觉，予以充分考虑的时间，允许西藏改革可以放慢，可是原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，不知醒悟，仍然与帝国主义、蒋匪帮勾结一起，想依靠他们的力量，来保存残酷的农奴制度，继续压迫剥削西藏人民，使西藏人民永远不能摆脱农奴制的枷锁，严重地违反了西藏人民的利益和各民族共同的利益。他们不但阻挠西藏自治区筹备工作，甚至明目张胆的发动武装叛乱，分裂祖国。这不惟国法所不许，也为全国六亿各族人民所不能容忍。西藏历来都是属于中国版图，所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，竟称为“国家”翻遍历史，从没有看到过西藏国这个名称。这篇“声明”真是荒谬绝伦，而且所谓达赖喇嘛的声明中，通篇竟找不到他本人自己讲话的口气，显然是印度扩张主义分子和叛乱分子所包办的伎俩而已。西藏是我国领土组成的一部分，决不容许任何人干涉我国内政。中央人民政府明令解散原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，使西藏迅速实现民族地方自治和逐步进行民主改革这一措施，我代表我州一百六十万各族人民表示热烈的拥护。
    德宏地区面貌逐步改观各族人民空前团结
    各位代表：我们德宏也是解放比较迟的一个地方，解放前，不仅贫困和落后，各民族之间还互相仇杀。解放后在党的领导下，通过民主改革、社会主义改造，生产得到发展，人民生活得到改善，各民族之间，空前的团结起来，已使过去贫困落后的面貌逐步改变。我是来自祖国边疆德宏傣族景颇族自治州的傣族代表。现在把我州大跃进以来几点情况简略的向大会汇报。我州少数民族，主要居住于边沿各县，生产关系，去年已从小农经济跃进到社会主义经济，五七年边沿各县参加农业合作社的农户只占总农户三分之一左右。自从农村进行了社会主义教育以后，各族人民眼睛擦亮了，思想觉悟提高了，看到合作社的优越性，纷纷要求入社组社，到一九五八年春天，结合水利积肥大生产运动，同时掀起了参加合作社的高潮，在短时间内，入社农户就超过百分之八十以上。可是革命是不断前进的。自从党中央公布建立人民公社的决定以后，我州边沿各县，也迫切要求向人民公社道路前进。现在，边沿各县少数民族地区在短短的时间内已经普遍建立了人民公社。怒江坝还组织了一个包括国营农场、国营棉场及各族人民三万五千多人口的人民公社。
    建设事业大有发展
    边疆地区在解放前是没有什么工业可言的。解放后在党和上级人民政府大力帮助下，才逐步建立起来，到目前为止，据不完全的统计，县以上办的厂矿已有五百六十个，区、乡、社办的厂矿二千零六十二个，全州共计有二千六百二十二个。机床，五七年只有二台；五八年已增加到四百六十一台。铁，五七年只有一千零三十七吨，五八年已增长到一万四千四百七十四吨。钢和铜，在五七年还没有生产，五八年已开始炼出钢一百九十五吨，粗铜一百二十八吨。煤，五七年也只有一万四千七百五十六吨，五八年增长到三十九万四千五百吨。农业方面，五七年粮食产量十一亿六千一百四十余万斤，棉花一万二千九百一十五市担，五八年粮食增长到十四亿五千余万斤，棉花二万四千八百三十六市担。文教卫生方面也有很大的跃进。全州共有小学生二十万零九千人，已占学龄儿童百分之九十六点九六。中学生一万一千二百五十一人，中等专业学校和高等专业学校学生一千二百四十六人。扫盲方面，在边沿各县主要民族地区，是用傣文和景颇文进行的。五七年以前只五万人左右，到五八年扫除文盲的有三十九万五千八百三十四人，已占青壮年四十万零五千五百七十三人的百分之九十七点六。
    瘴疠之乡消灭七害
    边疆傣族地区，向称瘴疠之乡，恶性疟疾、鼠疫、痢疾和许多烈性疾病，长期流行。当地各族人民苦于疾病，外地人也谈虎变色。州人委所在地的芒市，曾是最怕的一个瘴疠之区，
  向有一句“要到芒市坝，先把老婆嫁”的谚语。解放后，党和上级人民政府特别关怀，不断地派遣卫生防疫队到边沿县工作，设立卫生防疫机构，开展免费医疗，几年来不但疾病为害已经基本改观，更进一步发动群众消灭鼠、雀、蚊、蝇、蚤、虱、臭虫。现已基本消灭了七害。
  一切成就离不开党的领导
    我们十分清楚的知道，我们边疆少数民族地区各项社会主义建设事业、全面大跃进中所获得的辉煌成就，首先是和中国共产党、毛主席的英明领导分不开的。我们深深地知道，没有共产党、毛主席的领导，就没有我们少数民族的翻身解放，没有今天的繁荣幸福。我们只有跟着共产党走，听毛主席的话，永远团结在祖国的大家庭里，才有光明的前途。
    此外还要特别说明的，就是我州位于祖国的国防边境，对敌斗争，也是一项极其艰巨的任务。一年多以来，我州全面大跃进的成就，不仅反映了各族人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，向大自然进军、改造大自然、征服大自然的胜利；同时也反映了对敌斗争的胜利。一年多以来，残存境外的敌人，曾经在我们大跃进的道路上，进行了许多造谣破坏。例如我们修水利挖水沟，他们就造谣说我们挖战壕；我们镇压反革命，他们就造谣说把民族上层都逮捕去杀掉了。在境外甚至把他们这种谣言登诸报端，他们虽然极尽造谣污蔑之能事，但是这种阴谋破坏，都被我们已经大大提高了觉悟、大大团结一致的各族人民所揭破了，克服了，消除了。
    由于西藏的叛乱，使我深深感觉到：任何敌人都不会甘心死亡的，越接近死亡，他越要作垂死的挣扎，进行更为阴险的活动。所以我们要提高警惕，特别是我们出身于上层阶级的民族干部，更要特别提高警惕。敌人总是在各少数民族的上层人物中来物色他们的代理人的。我们必须坚决地立定脚根，不要上他们大当。我们要加速自己的改造，借以和广大劳动人民团结一起，在党和毛主席的领导下，为今后的更大跃进而贡献更多的力量。
