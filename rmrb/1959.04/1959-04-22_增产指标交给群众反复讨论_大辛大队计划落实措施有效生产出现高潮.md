This newspaper, Jinan, 21st reported: The Daxin Production Brigade of the East Suburb People's Commune in Licheng County, Shandong Province, extensively promoted democracy, handing over the wheat season and annual targets to the masses for repeated discussion, which led to the effective implementation of plans and a rapid upsurge in mass production.

During the later stage of the commune rectification, the brigade party committee, with the help of the provincial party committee's work team, followed the spirit of the Central Committee's resolution on several issues concerning people's communes, implementing a high degree of democracy by handing over this year's wheat yield and annual production targets to cadres at all levels and commune members' representatives for repeated discussion. After the commune rectification, the brigade's cadres also participated in production and led production alongside all the commune cadres. This further encouraged the enthusiasm of cadres at all levels to participate in labor.

After implementing the above methods, a mass upsurge in production immediately formed in the brigade. Many small teams also implemented comparison and competition for early attendance and good quality. Members of many groups discussed the work for the next day in advance, agreeing to see who could get up and start working earlier.

After mobilizing the masses, the brigade organized four specialized teams for comprehensive attacks: fertilizer accumulation, wheat field management, vegetables, and sideline occupations. The original plan for the 450 mu of spring land was to apply 20 million jin of fertilizer. The 220-member fertilizer accumulation team moved out in all directions, digging and mixing 15 million jin of fermented mud. Plus the use of compost and smoked manure, it greatly exceeded the original plan. The 120-member wheat field management team, in addition to trying every possible means to overcome the wheat jointing stage, is currently carrying out meticulous leaf trimming on some of the lodged wheat seedlings. The brigade's annual plan is to plant 1,200 mu of vegetables, exceeding last year's vegetable planting area by 50%. The sideline occupation team, composed of more than 80 people, can earn more than 6,400 yuan a month, with surplus left over after paying commune members' wages. (Lin Lin) (Attached picture)

    在整社的后期，这个大队党委在省委工作组的帮助下，遵照中央关于人民公社若干问题决议的精神，实行高度的民主，把今年小麦产量和全年产量指标交各级干部和社员代表反复讨论。整社以后，这个大队的干部也和全社干部一齐参加生产领导生产。更加鼓舞了各级干部参加劳动的积极性。
    实行上述办法以后，这个大队的生产，立即形成群众性的高潮。许多小队，还实行了出勤早、质量好的评比竞赛，许多小组的组员之间都事前商量好第二天的活路，约定到时候看谁起得早、动手早。
    群众发动起来以后，这个大队组织了积肥、麦田管理、蔬菜、副业四个专业队全面出击。四百五十亩春地，原定施肥二千万斤。二百二十人的积肥专业队四处出动，挖配糟泥一千五百万斤，加上沤粪、熏粪，大大超过了原来的计划，一百二十人的麦田管理专业队，除千方百计想办法巧攻小麦拔节关以外，目前正对部分倒伏的麦苗进行细致的剪叶；全队全年计划种菜一千二百亩，超过去年种菜面积50％；八十多人组织的副业专业队，一个月就可收入六千四百多元，除去发社员工资还有余。　（林麟）（附图片）
