　　Pine Waves
　　Xu Yuanlüe
    I love pine waves. I love even more the pine waves on high mountains.

    The pine waves have attracted me, even forced me to deeply recognize and understand nature. I feel the magnificent spirit of nature, and from this magnificent spirit, I am infected with a suddenly increased strength, a strong urge to immediately raise my arms and push away a mountain, to scoop up a river of water.

    Whether walking empty-handed or carrying a load uphill, when passing through a pine forest on a ridge or at the foot of a mountain, I can't help but sit down and rest for a while. There is no wind, no birdsong, only the sound of my own heart beating fiercely. The green grass is like a carpet, and mountain flowers are everywhere. My heartstrings gradually relax, and my mood gradually becomes leisurely. In these short few minutes, tranquility occupies everything.

    However, suddenly, but also quietly, a sound appears, like a line of tide slowly rolling forward from a very distant place, a place so distant that the eye can barely see it. It is also like a cavalry of ten thousand horses, in the faint sound of war drums, shaking the ground from an undetectable front. What is it, where is it? It seems to be in a very, very far away place, and yet it seems to have already splashed to my side....

    In the instant before my mind can make a correct judgment, it has suddenly and magically poured down in front of me. It seemed as if it was still in a far-off place in one direction, but in an instant, it has rushed towards me from all directions. It howls, it surges, it is as if the entire world, the entire universe has been drawn into the storm of pine waves, the whirlpool of pine waves. The rivers and mountains that seemed so indifferent and tame just now suddenly become earth-shattering, and all things dance.

    This is the powerful song of nature, the song of life. This song reveals the vigor and vitality of youth, and also sweeps away my full of fatigue, giving me excitement. In my eyes, I will quickly flash through scene after scene of magnificent scenes that I have been so familiar with, or that I can imagine. I can't help but immediately jump up, wanting to swing a huge iron hammer, like a steelworker forging sparks-flying iron blocks; wanting to raise a long pole, like a raftsman plunging into the life-and-death struggle of overcoming rapids and hidden reefs; wanting to hold a red flag and rush towards a battlefield filled with smoke. My heart is filled with the kind of joy that is unique to engaging in a strenuous labor or battle, and I confirm that only by being able to work or fight bravely and fearlessly can I be worthy of the magnificent mountains and rivers and the vast atmosphere before me. At this time, I will feel that my body and mind have been integrated with the boundless and surging pine waves.

    Only in this way, when the wind suddenly stops and the trees are still, and the sound of the waves is silent, when I am immersed in the quiet rest after experiencing a strenuous labor or battle, do I understand that the rivers, valleys, and mountains that have suddenly calmed down and become indifferent are not silent and sleeping, and are not merely changing their spring makeup and autumn colors time and time again. But rather, they are a furnace that erupts with the sparks of life at every moment, a source that gushes with happiness. I remember how many green leaves sprout and flourish here every year, and how many flowers bloom and fruits turn golden. And in the depths of the valleys and riverbeds, what is churning is the endless and unquenchable fiery magma.

    Whether walking empty-handed or carrying a load resting my shoulder, when passing through a pine forest on a ridge or at the foot of a mountain, I always sit there for a while. Like a person covered in sweat longing for a shower, I look forward to the pine waves that seem to come howling from the horizon. If there are lush and vigorous pine forests standing around my residence, I always open the windows, and often remind myself to step out of the room and wander in the pine forest for a while, so that my heart, morning and evening, echoes with the wonderful low hum of the pine waves, and with the striving of a true laborer and fighter, I can move towards the battle that always summons me.

　　松涛
　　徐远略
    我爱松涛。更爱高山上的松涛。
    松涛曾吸引我，甚至是迫使我深刻地认识和理解大自然。我感到大自然雄浑的气魄，并从这雄浑气魄中感染到陡然增长的力量，强烈地冲动起来，想立刻举起双臂推开一座山，掬起一江水。
    空手走路也好，挑担上山也好，当经过山脊或者山麓的一片松林时，我禁不住要坐下歇息一会儿。没有风声，没有鸟语，只能听见自己的心在剧烈地跳动。绿草如茵，山花满地。我的心弦逐渐缓和下来，情绪也逐渐变得闲散开来。短短的几分钟里，宁静占有了一切。
    然而，突然地，但又是轻悄悄地一个声音出现了，像一线海潮从十分遥远的、遥远得目力刚刚能看到的地方，慢慢地翻卷前来了。又是像一支万马奔腾的骑队，在隐约可闻的战鼓声中，在不可探测的前方震地而来了。是什么呢，在什么地方呢？好像在很远很远的地方，又好像已经飞溅到身边……。
    当我的思想还来不及作出正确判断的一瞬间，它突然神奇地已经倾泻到我的面前。原来好像它还是在一个方面的远方，而顷刻间，它已经从四面八方向我冲击过来。它呼啸着，翻腾着，像整个世界，整个宇宙都被卷进了松涛的风暴，松涛的漩涡中，刚才看来还是那样淡泊、驯服的河山，骤然间变得地动山摇，万物起舞了。
    这是强力的大自然之歌，生命之歌。这歌声揭示出朝气蓬勃的青春，也扫荡了我满怀的疲惫，给我以激动。在我的眼帘里会急速地闪过一幕一幕我曾经那么熟悉，或者是能够想像得到的壮丽的情景。我身不由己地会立刻跳起来，想抡起巨大的铁锤，像钢铁工人那样锻打火花四溅的铁块，想举起长篙，像放排工人那样投入战胜激流暗礁的生死搏斗；想手执红旗奔向硝烟弥漫的敌阵。我心里充满着那种只有投入一场剧烈劳动或战斗时所特有的喜悦，并确认只有能奋发无畏地劳动或战斗，才无愧于眼前这壮丽的山河，磅礴的气象。这时，我会感到自己的身心已经和这无边无际的汹涌澎湃的松涛交溶在一起了。
    只有这样，当刹那间风静树止，涛声沓然以后，当我沉浸在仿佛经历了一场剧烈劳动或战斗后的宁静的休息时，我才了解眼前顿时平息、淡泊下来的河川山谷并不是沉寂憨睡的，并不仅仅是一度又一度变换着春妆秋色的风物。而是每时每刻都迸发着生命的火花的熔炉，涌流着幸福的泉源。我才想起这里每年该有多少绿叶从萌芽到繁茂，该有多少花朵怒放、果实金黄。而在山谷、河床的深层，翻滚着的乃是无穷无尽的永不熄灭的烈火般的熔岩。
    空手走路也好，挑担歇肩也好，经过山脊或者山麓的松林时，我总要在那里坐一下。像一个满身污汗的人渴望淋浴一样地期待着那似乎从天际呼啸前来的松涛。如果在我住处的周围耸立有苍郁刚劲的松林，我总是打开窗扉，并且时常提醒自己跨出房门到松林里徜徉片刻，让我的心朝朝夕夕和着那奇妙的低吭的松涛，怀着真正的劳动者、战斗者的奋发，走向永远召唤着我的战斗。
