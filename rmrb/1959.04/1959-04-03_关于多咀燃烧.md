On Multi-Nozzle Combustion
Engineer of the Steel Department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Jiang Shenxiu

The employees of Youxian Iron Plant in Hunan, under the leadership of the Party, through long-term research and experimentation, created the multi-nozzle combustion method for tubular hot blast stoves, raising the hot blast temperature of small blast furnaces to over 700 degrees. It is truly an unprecedented miracle for a tubular hot blast stove to reach such a high wind temperature.

Tubular hot blast stoves have many advantages. Their construction costs are low, they require no steel or high-quality refractory materials, construction is fast, and operation is simple, so they are widely used in small blast furnaces. However, technical documents at home and abroad say that the disadvantage of tubular hot blast stoves is that the wind temperature is relatively low, generally only reaching 500 degrees, and the lifespan is short, only one or two months. If the wind temperature is further increased, the lifespan will be shortened. However, the creation of Youxian Iron Plant in Hunan not only increased the wind temperature to over 700 degrees, but also extended the lifespan to about six months. This greatly changed the original appearance of the tubular hot blast stove, demonstrating the great significance of the mass technological revolution.

Increasing the hot blast temperature is extremely important for iron smelting in blast furnaces. Increasing the wind temperature can reduce the coke ratio and increase pig iron production. It is generally believed that increasing the wind temperature from 500 degrees to 700 degrees can reduce the coke ratio by 12% and increase production by 12%. For current small blast furnaces, increasing the wind temperature is also an effective measure to improve the quality of pig iron. Due to the increase in wind temperature, the hearth temperature can be increased, making it easier for small blast furnaces to produce foundry pig iron (gray iron). More importantly, due to the increase in wind temperature and the reduction in coke ratio, the amount of sulfur brought into the blast furnace by coke is reduced (coke is the largest source of sulfur); due to the increase in wind temperature, the hearth temperature can be increased, and the slag desulfurization capacity can be improved. As a result of these two aspects, the sulfur content of pig iron can be significantly reduced. Therefore, increasing the hot blast temperature is a major measure to strive for high yield and high quality in small blast furnaces.

After the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant in Pingshan County, Hebei Province, promoted the advanced experience of Youxian County in Hunan, it achieved significant results. Output increased sharply by 100%, coke ratio decreased by 50%, and the sulfur content of pig iron also decreased to within the scope stipulated by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's provisional standards for pig iron in small blast furnaces. The National Small Blast Furnace Production Technology Conference recently held in Beijing affirmed this advanced experience and unanimously agreed to promote it nationwide.

The multi-nozzle combustion method for tubular hot blast stoves at Youxian Iron Plant in Hunan is a relatively complete set of experiences. Its main content includes three aspects: multi-nozzle combustion, low-position combustion, and reducing flame combustion:

(1) Multi-Nozzle Combustion:
Ordinary tubular hot blast stoves only have two to four combustion nozzles, all located at the front of the furnace. The heating of the iron pipes inside the furnace depends entirely on these few combustion nozzles. In this case, the firepower is concentrated at the front of the furnace, causing an uneven temperature distribution with high temperature at the front and low temperature at the rear. Cold air enters the hot blast stove and passes through the high-temperature area iron pipes for a short time, so the wind temperature cannot be increased. If the wind temperature is to be increased, only the combustion intensity of the front combustion nozzles can be strengthened, but this will affect the lifespan of the iron pipes in the front of the furnace, thus limiting the further increase of the wind temperature. The new method in Youxian County, Hunan, is to install combustion nozzles not only at the front, but also on both sides of the furnace. The entire hot blast stove is equipped with ten to twelve combustion nozzles, with three to four nozzles each at the front, left, and right ends. Using this multi-nozzle combustion method, a large area of combustion is created inside the hot blast stove, with both front and rear temperatures being high. The cold air passes through the longer high-temperature iron pipes, and the wind temperature is greatly increased.

(2) Low-Position Combustion:
The combustion nozzles of ordinary tubular hot blast stoves are positioned relatively high. Since the combustion flame usually flows upward, the upper part of the iron pipes receives more firepower, while the lower part receives less. Youxian Iron Plant in Hunan lowered the position of the combustion nozzles, so that the upper and lower parts of the iron pipes are at high temperatures, thus fully exerting the heat exchange effect of the iron pipes and contributing to the increase of the wind temperature.

(3) Reducing Flame Combustion:
When ordinary tubular hot blast stoves send gas to the combustion nozzles for combustion, in order to ensure complete combustion of the gas, excess air is usually supplied, creating an oxidizing flame. Due to the influence of high temperature and oxidation, the iron pipes at the front are easily burned out due to strong oxidation. In response to this situation, Youxian Iron Plant in Hunan adopted the reducing flame combustion method. When the gas is burned, less air is supplied, and there is no excess air. The flame is reducing, so although the temperature is high, the iron pipes are not easily oxidized and burned, extending the life of the cast iron pipes, which also extends the life of the hot blast stove.

Ordinary tubular hot blast stoves only need to undergo some modification work to implement the advanced experience of Youxian County in Hunan. The No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant in Pingshan County, Hebei Province, completed the modification of the hot blast stoves of more than ten small blast furnaces in the factory in just five days, and also created brick-built combustion nozzles with good combustion effects, solving the problem of insufficient supply of combustion nozzle components.

In order to better promote the advanced experience of multi-nozzle combustion, the following issues also need to be paid attention to:

(1) As a result of multi-nozzle combustion, the temperature of the waste gas leaving the hot blast stove has increased, and there is even a phenomenon of continued combustion of gas in the flue. In addition to appropriately controlling the ratio of gas and air, attention should also be paid to improving the lining quality of the flue and chimney to prevent the flue and chimney from being burned out.

(2) After adopting the multi-nozzle combustion method, the amount of gas and air used by the hot blast stove has increased. Therefore, the height of the chimney should be appropriately increased and the cross-section of the flue should be enlarged to prevent flame ejection and ensure the normal combustion of gas in the furnace.

(3) It is necessary to prevent air leakage from the iron pipes of the hot blast stove. While adopting multi-nozzle combustion, it is necessary to vigorously improve the quality of the iron pipes (the sulfur content and phosphorus content of the pig iron used to cast iron pipes should be as low as possible) and the rust welding quality of the iron pipes.

    关于多咀燃烧
    冶金工业部钢铁司工程师　蒋慎修
    湖南攸县铁厂的职工，在党的领导下，经过长时期的钻研和试验，创造了管式热风炉多咀燃烧法，把小高炉的热风温度提高到了七百度以上。管式热风炉达到这样高的风温，确是一项史无前例的奇迹。
    管式热风炉有许多优点，它的建设费用低，无需钢材和优质耐火材料，建设速度快，操作简便，因而在小高炉上得到广泛的采用。但是中外技术文献都说，管式热风炉的缺点是风温较低，一般只能达到五百度，且寿命较短，只有一、二个月，如果再提高风温，寿命还要缩短。可是湖南攸县铁厂的创造，不但使风温提高到七百度以上，寿命也延长到六个月左右。这就大大改变了管式热风炉的原来面貌，显示了群众性技术革命的重大意义。
    提高热风温度，对于高炉炼铁有极重要的意义。提高风温能够降低焦比，增加生铁产量。通常认为，风温从五百度提高到七百度，可以降低焦比12％，增加产量12％。对于目前小高炉来说，提高风温更是改进生铁质量的有效措施。由于风温的提高，炉缸温度可以提高，因而小高炉更容易炼出铸造生铁（灰口铁）。更重要的是，由于风温的提高，焦比降低，因而焦炭带入高炉的硫减少（焦炭是硫的最大来源）；由于风温的提高，炉缸温度可以提高，炉渣脱硫能力可以提高。由于这两方面影响的结果，生铁的含硫量可以显著降低。因此，提高热风温度是争取小高炉高产优质的一项重大措施。
    河北省平山县第一钢铁厂推广湖南攸县的先进经验以后，获得了显著的结果。产量猛增一倍，焦比降低一半，生铁含硫量也降低到冶金部颁布的小高炉生铁暂行标准所规定的范围以内。最近在北京召开的全国小高炉生产技术会议，肯定了这项先进经验，并一致同意，在全国范围内普遍推广。
    湖南攸县铁厂管式热风炉多咀燃烧法是一套比较完整的经验。它的主要内容是：多咀燃烧、低位置燃烧和还元焰燃烧等三个方面：
      （1）多咀燃烧：
    普通管式热风炉只有二到四个燃烧咀，都位于炉子的前端。炉内铁管的烧热，全靠这几个燃烧咀。在这种情况下火力集中在炉子前端，造成前部温度高，后部温度低的温度不均匀情况。冷风进入热风炉，通过高炉区域铁管的时间短，风温便提不高。如果要提高风温，只有加强前端燃烧咀的燃烧强度，但是这会影响炉子前部铁管的寿命，因而限制了风温的进一步提高。湖南攸县的新方法是不仅在前端有燃烧咀，而且还在炉子两侧安装燃烧咀，整个热风炉共安装了十至十二个燃烧咀，前端、左端、右端各装三至四个。采用这种多咀燃烧方法，热风炉内造成了大面积燃烧，前后温度都较高，冷风经过较长的高温铁管，风温就大大提高了。
    （2）低位置燃烧：
    普通管式热风炉的燃烧咀位置比较高，由于燃烧的火焰通常向上流动，因而铁管的上部受到火力较大，铁管的下部受到火力较小。湖南攸县铁厂把燃烧咀的位置降低，使铁管上下都是高温，因而充分发挥了铁管的换热作用，有助于风温的提高。
      （3）还元火焰燃烧：
    普通管式热风炉在送煤气到燃烧咀前燃烧时，为了保证煤气的完全燃烧，通常都供应过剩的空气，造成氧化性火焰。由于高温和氧化的影响，前部的铁管很容易受强烈氧化而被烧坏。针对这种情况，湖南攸县铁厂采用了还元火焰燃烧法，在煤气燃烧时，供应空气较少，没有过剩的空气，火焰是还元性的，因而温度虽高，铁管却不易受氧化而被烧坏，延长了铸铁管的寿命，也就是延长了热风炉的寿命。
    普通管式热风炉只需通过一些改装工作，即能推行湖南攸县的先进经验。河北省平山县第一钢铁厂大干五天就把全厂十多个小高炉的热风炉改装完成，并且还创造了燃烧效果很好的砖砌燃烧咀，解决了燃烧咀部件的供应不足问题。
    为了更好地推广多咀燃烧的先进经验，还需要注意以下几个问题：
      （1）由于多咀燃烧的结果，离开热风炉的废气温度提高了，甚至煤气在烟道内有继续燃烧的现象。这除了应该适当控制煤气和空气的比例以外，还应当注意改进烟道和烟囱的内衬质量，以防烟道和烟囱被烧坏。
      （2）采用多咀燃烧法以后，热风炉所用的煤气和空气量增加了。因此，要适当提高烟囱的高度，扩大烟道的断面，以防火焰外喷，保证煤气在炉内的正常燃烧。
      （3）必须防止热风炉铁管的漏风现象，在采用多咀燃烧的同时，必须大力改进铁管的质量（铸造铁管用的生铁含硫量和含磷量尽量低些）和铁管的锈接质量。（附图片）
