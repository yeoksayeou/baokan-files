Yunnan's Iron, Steel and Copper Production Front Sings a Song of Triumph

　　Kunming, April 5th. Yunnan's iron, steel and copper production front achieved a triumphant victory in the first quarter. The province's steel production fulfilled 104.6% of the first quarter's plan, steel materials fulfilled 100.7%, iron fulfilled 102.8%, copper fulfilled 100.1%, coal fulfilled 108.1%, and coke fulfilled 110.1%.

　　Since the beginning of spring, the workers on the province's iron, steel, and copper front have immediately launched a high tide of competition for high production and high quality. While striving for high production, various localities have also put forward requirements for high quality. The Party and government leaders of the steelmaking workshop of the Kunming No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant analyzed and studied desulfurization and dephosphorization measures together with the workers. In a short period of time, the broad masses of workers put forward more than 400 suggestions, which gradually reduced the sulfur and phosphorus content, and the steel ingots that could be rolled into steel materials jumped from 30% to 90%.

　　Now, on the basis of overfulfilling the state plan for the first quarter, the broad masses of workers on the province's iron, steel, and copper smelting production front are advancing victoriously and investing in the second quarter's production, determined to push iron, steel, and copper smelting production to a new peak of the Great Leap Forward.

    云南钢铁铜生产战线高奏凯歌
    本报昆明5日电　云南第一季度钢铁铜生产战线高奏凯歌，全省钢产量完成了第一季度计划的104.6％，钢材完成了100.7％，铁完成了102.8％，铜完成了100.1％，煤完成了108.1％，焦完成了110.1％。
    入春以来，全省钢铁铜战线上的职工就立即掀起了高产优质的竞赛高潮。在力争高产的同时，各地还提出了高质的要求。昆明第一钢铁厂炼钢车间党、政领导干部同职工一道分析研究脱硫、脱磷的措施，在很短的时间内，广大职工就提出了四百多件建议，使硫、磷的含量逐渐下降，能轧钢材的钢锭由30％一跃而为90％。
    现在，全省钢铁、炼铜生产战线上的广大职工，在超额完成第一季度国家计划的基础上，乘胜前进，投入二季度生产，决心把钢铁、炼铜生产推向一个新的跃进高峰。
