Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: Tibetan representatives and members attending the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing held consecutive symposiums on the 19th and 20th regarding the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." The representatives and members were extremely indignant at this statement, which was pieced together with lies and filled with malice, and solemnly declared that all Tibetan people would join the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country in expressing their resolute opposition to this "statement."

The Tibetan representatives and members attending the symposium came from Tibet, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, and other places. In their speeches, they first expressed their firm support for Premier Zhou's report at the National People's Congress, pointing out that the State Council's measures to quell the rebellion in Tibet were completely correct. They demanded the thorough suppression of the rebellion and the gradual implementation of democratic reforms, so that the Tibetan people could live a happy life like the people in other parts of the country.

The representatives and members unanimously pointed out that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" is nothing but a pack of lies and does not represent the Dalai Lama's true intentions. In their speeches, they cited many facts to refute the lies in the "statement."

Xie Rao Dengzhu, a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, told everyone about what he saw and heard in Lhasa. He said indignantly that the so-called "statement" saying that "on March 17th, two or three mortar shells were fired at the Norbulingka Palace" was a clumsy fabrication. On March 17th, I was in Lhasa, and I and all the residents of Lhasa can testify to this. Although the rebel elements openly launched a full-scale armed rebellion on March 10th, there was no gunfire in the entire city of Lhasa on March 17th, let alone two or three mortar shells. However, the next day in the afternoon, the people of Lhasa did hear gunfire coming from the rebel positions in Norbulingka. The rebel elements first fired at the Lhasa General Station of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration.

Xie Rao Dengzhu said that the "statement" claiming that "a large number of Tibetans came to the streets of Lhasa to hold demonstrations..." was "decided by the people themselves" is complete nonsense. The people of Lhasa have witnessed and felt the warmth of the Communist Party over the past few years, and every one of them supports the Communist Party. However, the former Tibetan local government refused to relinquish its cruel rule over these kind people, forcing residents to implement a "joint guarantee system," coercing good people to do things they did not want to do, and not allowing any disobedience, otherwise they would be subjected to cruel and vicious punishments, even the death penalty. During the rebellion, the rebel elements coerced many kind residents, causing many people to suffer.

The representatives and members pointed out that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" promoting the "independence" aspirations of the Tibetan people is a fallacy that distorts history and disregards reality.

Master Xirao Jiacuo, President of the Buddhist Association of China, said that Tibet has always been an inseparable part of China's territory. As early as seven hundred years ago, Tibet was an administrative region of China. The Dalai Lama gradually ascended to the political stage from the fifth generation onwards. He was conferred by the central government in Beijing during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. The former Tibetan local government (Kasha) was established during the time of the seventh Dalai Lama, namely the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, with the approval of the central government in Beijing, and was directly under the leadership of the Minister Resident in Tibet of the central government in Beijing. The so-called Tibetan "independence" is nothing more than a conspiracy by British imperialism to invade Tibet, a territory of our country. This consistent conspiracy began in the early 20th century. This master, who has studied Buddhism in Tibet for more than thirty years, also said that the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet signed in 1951 by the Central Government and the former Tibetan local government confirmed that Tibet is a part of our country's territory. These facts, even the imperialists and reactionaries dare not deny, so it can be seen how absurd it is to promote the so-called "independence" aspirations of the Tibetan people!

Zaxi Wangxu, Vice Governor of Qinghai Province, said that Tibet is an inseparable part of the motherland, which is formed by historical development. The fate of Tibet is closely linked to the fate of the motherland. Tibetans are Chinese, and Chinese include Tibetans. This is something that no one can change. China includes dozens of ethnic groups, including the Tibetan people. Although each ethnic group has its own characteristics in terms of economy, language, writing, customs, etc. due to different historical development conditions, what is more important is that they have a common destiny and consistent political demands, which is the unity of the motherland's big family and the unity of all ethnic groups, and jointly taking the socialist road under the leadership of the Party. It would be absurd to say that every ethnic group should become a country.

Zaxi Wangxu and Sangji Yexi, Vice Governor of Sichuan Province, said that the so-called "statement" promoting Tibetan "independence" issued in the name of the Dalai Lama reflects the demands of the imperialist aggressors and the attempts of a small handful of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, who want to continue to maintain the backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system, but this is wishful thinking.

Huang Zhengqing, Vice Governor of Gansu Province and Governor of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and representatives and members from Gansu and Sichuan Provinces and the Qamdo region, including Suo Guan Ying, Yang Fuxing, Lin Jiayong, Xia Ke Dao Deng, and Bangda Duoji, pointed out in their speeches that since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government has fully complied with the seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, respected local religious freedom and customs, and even allowed the reforms in Tibet to be slowed down in order to take care of the ideological situation of the upper-class people in Tibet. The Central People's Government has done its utmost. The central government's policy is completely correct and has won the support of the broad masses of Tibetan people. The so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" that the Tibetan local government "did its best to abide by the seventeen-article agreement" and that the Central People's Government "has been interfering" is a complete reversal of black and white.

In their speeches, the representatives and members unanimously condemned the Tibetan rebel elements and the upper-class reactionary clique for launching an armed rebellion under the banner of safeguarding religion, betraying the motherland, undermining religion, and endangering the interests of the nation.

Awang Jiacuo, Vice Governor of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, said that the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, for their own interests, resort to all means, even undermining religion and killing Living Buddhas. He cited the facts of the murder of Gedha Living Buddha. He said that Gedha Living Buddha worked hard for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, but the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet colluded with imperialist elements to poison him to death. He also revealed that the rebel elements used temples as bases for rebellion, coercing patriotic lamas to betray the motherland and commit crimes.

Many representatives and members angrily revealed the miserable lives of the Tibetan people under the rule of the former Tibetan local government. Awang Jiacuo had lived in Tibet for more than twenty years. He said that he had never seen the former Tibetan local government do anything good for the people during his time in Tibet. He gave an example: Tibet often suffered from floods, but the former Tibetan local government never cared. In 1954, a flood occurred in the Gyantse area, and the Central People's Government distributed huge amounts of relief funds to the local area. This was the first time that the disaster victims in Tibet received relief. However, the former Tibetan local government sent two so-called "relief" officials to the local area to extort and blackmail the people, making their lives even more miserable. Therefore, the local people said: the small disaster (referring to the flood) has passed, and the big disaster (referring to the officials) has come. A few years ago, he went to Lhasa again and saw that many places had houses but no people, and the common people were forced to flee because they could not afford the various corvée labor of the former Tibetan local government. Even in the Lhasa area, there were many people who had no food to eat and begged everywhere. Awang Jiacuo said that the common people asked him with concern when they would be liberated. The former Tibetan local government kept saying that they were for the benefit of the nation, but they had not done a single good thing for the Tibetan people.

Sangji Yexi and Huang Zhengqing excitedly described the new atmosphere of great national unity and great production development that has emerged in the Tibetan autonomous prefectures in Sichuan and Gansu provinces after carrying out various reforms and implementing national regional autonomy. They unanimously stated that while vigorously building their own ethnic minority areas, they will actively support the Tibetan people and jointly build a new Tibet under the leadership of the Communist Party.

### 藏族人大代表和政协委员在座谈会上庄重宣称  藏族人民坚决反对所谓达赖喇嘛的声明  要求彻底平息叛乱　逐步实行民主改革　同全国人民一起前进

    藏族人大代表和政协委员在座谈会上庄重宣称
    藏族人民坚决反对所谓达赖喇嘛的声明
    要求彻底平息叛乱　逐步实行民主改革　同全国人民一起前进
    新华社22日讯　正在北京出席全国人民代表大会和政协全国委员会会议的藏族代表和委员，19日和20日就所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”连续举行了座谈会。代表和委员们对这个用谎言凑成、充满恶意的声明十分愤慨，并且庄重宣称：全体藏族人民将同全国各族人民一起对这个“声明”表示坚决反对。
    出席座谈会的藏族代表和委员来自西藏、四川、青海、甘肃、云南等地，他们在发言中首先表示坚决拥护周总理在人代会上的报告，指出国务院关于平息西藏叛乱的措施是完全正确的。他们要求彻底平息叛乱、逐步实行民主改革，使西藏人民和全国其他各地人民一样过幸福的生活。
    代表和委员们一致指出，所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”只是一纸谎言，它不是达赖喇嘛的本意。他们在发言中列举了许多事实驳斥了“声明”的谎言。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会委员协饶登珠在发言中向大家讲了他在拉萨时的见闻。他愤慨地说，所谓“声明”中说“3月17日，迫击炮朝着罗布林卡宫打了两三炮”，这是一个拙劣的捏造。3月17日，我正在拉萨，我和拉萨所有的居民都可以作证。虽然叛乱分子3月10日已公开发动全面武装叛乱，但是3月17日这天，拉萨全市没有一响枪炮声，更没有两三响迫击炮声。但是第二天午后，拉萨人民确实听到从罗布林卡叛乱分子的阵地发出了枪声，叛乱分子首先对青藏公路管理局拉萨总站进行了射击。
    协饶登珠说，“声明”中说“大批西藏人来到拉萨街头，举行示威……”是“人民自己决定”的，这完全是一派胡说。拉萨人民几年来亲眼看到，亲身感到共产党的温暖，他们每一个人都拥护共产党。但是原西藏地方政府对这些善良的人民的残酷统治一点也不肯松手，强迫居民实行“连环保”，威逼良民做他们所不愿干的事，不能有任何违抗，否则便施加残酷毒辣的刑罚，甚至处以死刑。叛乱分子在叛乱过程中，裹胁了许多善良的居民，使许多人遭到毒害。
    代表和委员们指出，所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中，鼓吹的西藏人的“独立”愿望，是歪曲历史和不顾现实的谬论。
    中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错大师说，西藏历来是中国领土不可分割的一部分。早在七百多年前，西藏就是中国的行政区域，达赖喇嘛是从第五代起才逐渐登上政治舞台的，他是清代康熙年间由北京的中央政府册封的；原西藏地方政府（噶厦）是第七世达赖时，即清乾隆年间由北京的中央政府批准成立的，直接属于北京的中央政府驻藏办事大臣领导。所谓西藏“独立”，只不过是英帝国主义侵略我国领土西藏的阴谋，这个一贯的阴谋是从二十世纪初开始搞起来的。这位曾经在西藏研究佛学达三十多年的大师说，1951年由中央人民政府和原西藏地方政府签订的关于和平解放西藏的协议，确认西藏是我国领土的一部分。这些事实，连帝国主义和反动派也不敢不承认，可见鼓吹所谓西藏人“独立”的愿望是何等荒谬！
    青海省副省长札喜旺徐说，西藏是祖国不可分割的一部分，这是历史发展形成的。西藏的命运和祖国的命运紧密地联系在一起。西藏人是中国人，中国人包括西藏人在内，这是任何人改变不了的。中国包括藏族在内有几十个民族，虽然由于历史发展条件不同，各民族在经济、语言、文字、风俗习惯等方面各有特点，但是更重要的是他们有着共同的命运和一致的政治要求，这就是祖国大家庭的统一和各民族的团结，并且在党的领导下共同走社会主义的道路。如果说每一个民族都成为一个国家，那真是荒谬绝伦。
    札喜旺徐和四川省副省长桑吉悦希说，以达赖喇嘛名义发表的所谓“声明”中鼓吹的西藏“独立”，是反映了帝国主义侵略者的要求，反映了西藏一小撮上层反动分子的企图，他们想继续维持落后、黑暗、反动、残酷的农奴制度，但是这是白日做梦。
    甘肃省副省长、甘南藏族自治州州长黄正清，甘肃、四川省和昌都地区的代表和委员索观瀛、杨复兴、林甲镛、夏克刀登、邦达多吉等人，在发言中指出，和平解放西藏以来，中央人民政府完全遵守和平解放西藏的十七条协议，尊重当地的宗教信仰自由和风俗习惯，为了照顾西藏上层人士的思想情况，甚至允许在西藏的改革放慢一些。中央人民政府做到了仁至义尽。中央的政策是完全正确的，得到了广大藏族人民的拥护。所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中说西藏地方政府“尽最大力量来遵守十七条协议”，中央人民政府“一直进行干涉”，完全是颠倒黑白。
    代表和委员们在发言中一致谴责西藏叛乱分子和上层反动集团，打着维护宗教的旗号，发动武装叛乱，背叛祖国，破坏宗教，危害民族的利益。
    四川省甘孜藏族自治州副州长阿旺嘉错说，西藏上层反动分子为了他们的利益，不择一切手段，甚至破坏宗教，杀害活佛。他举出格达活佛被害的事实。他说，格达活佛为和平解放西藏而辛勤奔走，西藏上层反动分子却勾结帝国主义分子用毒药害死了他。他还揭露叛乱分子把寺庙当做叛乱的据点，胁迫爱国喇嘛背叛祖国，为非作歹。
    许多代表和委员都愤怒地揭露了在原西藏地方政府统治下藏族人民所过的悲惨生活。阿旺嘉错曾经在西藏住过二十多年，他说，他在西藏时候从来没有看到过原西藏地方政府为人民做过什么好事。他举例说：西藏经常发生水灾，但是原西藏地方政府从不过问。1954年江孜地区发生水灾，中央人民政府给当地发放了巨额救济款，这是西藏的灾民第一次得到救济。可是原西藏地方政府却派了两个所谓“救济”官员去当地大肆敲诈勒索，使人民生活更痛苦，因而当地人民说：小灾（指水灾）过去了，大灾（指官员）又来了。几年前他又去过拉萨一次，看到很多地方是有屋无人，老百姓都因负担不起原西藏地方政府的各种差役而被迫逃难了。就是在拉萨地区，也有许许多多人没有饭吃，到处乞讨。阿旺嘉错说，老百姓见到我都关切地问道，他们什么时候才能得解放？原西藏地方政府口口声声说他们为了民族利益，但是他们没有为藏族人民做过一件好事。
    桑吉悦希、黄正清在发言中都兴奋地叙述了他们所在的四川、甘肃两省的藏族自治州在进行各项改革、实行民族区域自治以后所出现的民族大团结、生产大发展的新气象，他们一致表示在大力建设本民族地区的同时，要积极支援西藏人民，在共产党领导下共同建设新西藏。（附图片）
    出席第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的藏族代表和出席政协第三届全国委员会第一次全体会议的藏族委员，4月19日和20日举行座谈会，对印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”表示极大愤慨，并且庄重宣称：全体藏族人民将同全国各族人民一起对这个“声明”表示坚决反对。新华社记者　牛畏予摄
