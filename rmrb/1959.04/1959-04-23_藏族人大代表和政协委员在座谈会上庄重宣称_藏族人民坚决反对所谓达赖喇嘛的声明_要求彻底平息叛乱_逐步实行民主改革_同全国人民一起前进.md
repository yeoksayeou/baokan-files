Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: Tibetan representatives and members attending the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing held consecutive symposiums on the 19th and 20th regarding the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." The representatives and members were extremely indignant at this statement, which was pieced together with lies and filled with malice, and solemnly declared that all Tibetan people would join the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country in expressing their resolute opposition to this "statement."

The Tibetan representatives and members attending the symposium came from Tibet, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, and other places. In their speeches, they first expressed their firm support for Premier Zhou's report at the National People's Congress, pointing out that the State Council's measures to quell the rebellion in Tibet were completely correct. They demanded the thorough suppression of the rebellion and the gradual implementation of democratic reforms, so that the Tibetan people could live a happy life like the people in other parts of the country.

The representatives and members unanimously pointed out that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" is nothing but a pack of lies and does not represent the Dalai Lama's true intentions. In their speeches, they cited many facts to refute the lies in the "statement."

Xie Rao Dengzhu, a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, told everyone about what he saw and heard in Lhasa. He said indignantly that the so-called "statement" saying that "on March 17th, two or three mortar shells were fired at the Norbulingka Palace" was a clumsy fabrication. On March 17th, I was in Lhasa, and I and all the residents of Lhasa can testify to this. Although the rebel elements openly launched a full-scale armed rebellion on March 10th, there was no gunfire in the entire city of Lhasa on March 17th, let alone two or three mortar shells. However, the next day in the afternoon, the people of Lhasa did hear gunfire coming from the rebel positions in Norbulingka. The rebel elements first fired at the Lhasa General Station of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration.

Xie Rao Dengzhu said that the "statement" claiming that "a large number of Tibetans came to the streets of Lhasa to hold demonstrations..." was "decided by the people themselves" is complete nonsense. The people of Lhasa have witnessed and felt the warmth of the Communist Party over the past few years, and every one of them supports the Communist Party. However, the former Tibetan local government refused to relinquish its cruel rule over these kind people, forcing residents to implement a "joint guarantee system," coercing good people to do things they did not want to do, and not allowing any disobedience, otherwise they would be subjected to cruel and vicious punishments, even the death penalty. During the rebellion, the rebel elements coerced many kind residents, causing many people to suffer.

The representatives and members pointed out that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" promoting the "independence" aspirations of the Tibetan people is a fallacy that distorts history and disregards reality.

Master Xirao Jiacuo, President of the Buddhist Association of China, said that Tibet has always been an inseparable part of China's territory. As early as seven hundred years ago, Tibet was an administrative region of China. The Dalai Lama gradually ascended to the political stage from the fifth generation onwards. He was conferred by the central government in Beijing during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. The former Tibetan local government (Kasha) was established during the time of the seventh Dalai Lama, namely the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, with the approval of the central government in Beijing, and was directly under the leadership of the Minister Resident in Tibet of the central government in Beijing. The so-called Tibetan "independence" is nothing more than a conspiracy by British imperialism to invade Tibet, a territory of our country. This consistent conspiracy began in the early 20th century. This master, who has studied Buddhism in Tibet for more than thirty years, also said that the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet signed in 1951 by the Central Government and the former Tibetan local government confirmed that Tibet is a part of our country's territory. These facts, even the imperialists and reactionaries dare not deny, so it can be seen how absurd it is to promote the so-called "independence" aspirations of the Tibetan people!

Zaxi Wangxu, Vice Governor of Qinghai Province, said that Tibet is an inseparable part of the motherland, which is formed by historical development. The fate of Tibet is closely linked to the fate of the motherland. Tibetans are Chinese, and Chinese include Tibetans. This is something that no one can change. China includes dozens of ethnic groups, including the Tibetan people. Although each ethnic group has its own characteristics in terms of economy, language, writing, customs, etc. due to different historical development conditions, what is more important is that they have a common destiny and consistent political demands, which is the unity of the motherland's big family and the unity of all ethnic groups, and jointly taking the socialist road under the leadership of the Party. It would be absurd to say that every ethnic group should become a country.

Zaxi Wangxu and Sangji Yexi, Vice Governor of Sichuan Province, said that the so-called "statement" promoting Tibetan "independence" issued in the name of the Dalai Lama reflects the demands of the imperialist aggressors and the attempts of a small handful of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, who want to continue to maintain the backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system, but this is wishful thinking.

Huang Zhengqing, Vice Governor of Gansu Province and Governor of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and representatives and members from Gansu and Sichuan Provinces and the Qamdo region, including Suo Guan Ying, Yang Fuxing, Lin Jiayong, Xia Ke Dao Deng, and Bangda Duoji, pointed out in their speeches that since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government has fully complied with the seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, respected local religious freedom and customs, and even allowed the reforms in Tibet to be slowed down in order to take care of the ideological situation of the upper-class people in Tibet. The Central People's Government has done its utmost. The central government's policy is completely correct and has won the support of the broad masses of Tibetan people. The so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" that the Tibetan local government "did its best to abide by the seventeen-article agreement" and that the Central People's Government "has been interfering" is a complete reversal of black and white.

In their speeches, the representatives and members unanimously condemned the Tibetan rebel elements and the upper-class reactionary clique for launching an armed rebellion under the banner of safeguarding religion, betraying the motherland, undermining religion, and endangering the interests of the nation.

Awang Jiacuo, Vice Governor of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, said that the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, for their own interests, resort to all means, even undermining religion and killing Living Buddhas. He cited the facts of the murder of Gedha Living Buddha. He said that Gedha Living Buddha worked hard for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, but the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet colluded with imperialist elements to poison him to death. He also revealed that the rebel elements used temples as bases for rebellion, coercing patriotic lamas to betray the motherland and commit crimes.

Many representatives and members angrily revealed the miserable lives of the Tibetan people under the rule of the former Tibetan local government. Awang Jiacuo had lived in Tibet for more than twenty years. He said that he had never seen the former Tibetan local government do anything good for the people during his time in Tibet. He gave an example: Tibet often suffered from floods, but the former Tibetan local government never cared. In 1954, a flood occurred in the Gyantse area, and the Central People's Government distributed huge amounts of relief funds to the local area. This was the first time that the disaster victims in Tibet received relief. However, the former Tibetan local government sent two so-called "relief" officials to the local area to extort and blackmail the people, making their lives even more miserable. Therefore, the local people said: the small disaster (referring to the flood) has passed, and the big disaster (referring to the officials) has come. A few years ago, he went to Lhasa again and saw that many places had houses but no people, and the common people were forced to flee because they could not afford the various corv√©e labor of the former Tibetan local government. Even in the Lhasa area, there were many people who had no food to eat and begged everywhere. Awang Jiacuo said that the common people asked him with concern when they would be liberated. The former Tibetan local government kept saying that they were for the benefit of the nation, but they had not done a single good thing for the Tibetan people.

Sangji Yexi and Huang Zhengqing excitedly described the new atmosphere of great national unity and great production development that has emerged in the Tibetan autonomous prefectures in Sichuan and Gansu provinces after carrying out various reforms and implementing national regional autonomy. They unanimously stated that while vigorously building their own ethnic minority areas, they will actively support the Tibetan people and jointly build a new Tibet under the leadership of the Communist Party.
