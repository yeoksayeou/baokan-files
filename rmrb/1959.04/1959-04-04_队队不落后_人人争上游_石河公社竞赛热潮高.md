Teams Not Falling Behind, Everyone Striving to Be Advanced
    Shishi Commune's Competition Heats Up
    (Our newspaper, Hefei, 3rd dispatch) The Shishi People's Commune in Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, has launched a year-long competition and phased assessment of the national production competition movement. This commune promptly summarizes achievements and exchanges experiences through the competition movement. It calls on all teams to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and constantly push the production movement from one climax to another.
    In mid-February of this year, the Shishi Commune Party Committee comprehensively summarized the production experience of 1958, and on this basis, formulated a year-long production competition plan for this year, and launched a production competition movement throughout the commune. The main content of the year-long competition is eight comparisons: comparing output, comparing measures to increase production, comparing commune members' income, comparing welfare undertakings such as canteens, comparing production management, comparing commune members' ideological awareness, comparing cadres' participation in production and leadership in production, and comparing cadres' planting experimental fields. In addition to the year-round competition content, different competition contents are also proposed according to different production seasons, such as comparing spring plowing preparations in the spring and comparing autumn harvest, plowing and planting in the autumn. All fourteen brigades and one hundred and sixty-one small teams of the entire commune have invested in this competition movement. The commune selects model brigades every half month, the brigade selects model small teams every five to seven days, and a final evaluation is conducted at the end of the year. The method of inspection and evaluation is to organize representatives from various teams and commune members to conduct comprehensive viewing, focus on checking, summarizing while checking, praising while checking, criticizing while checking, and improving while checking. Shishi Commune recently conducted another inspection and evaluation, and selected Yuqiao, Wangyang, Wenchang, Fanshen, Yaozha, Hexing, and Jiaotong as model teams, among which Yuqiao Brigade did the best in all aspects of its work.
    Recently, the production brigades have set off a heat wave of learning from Yuqiao and catching up with Yuqiao, which has greatly promoted production. Yangqiao Brigade, which was relatively poor in this evaluation, expressed its determination to strive for the upstream in the next evaluation. Shishi Brigade, which did not receive the red flag in this evaluation, wrote a battle note on the spot, saying that it must compete with the model team. Yuqiao Brigade expressed that it would never be complacent and would always keep the red flag.
    Through this inspection and evaluation, the commune leadership also discovered some problems in production, such as the slow progress of seedling raising in some teams, the poor quality of some rice seedling fields, weeds not being completely removed, uneven sowing, and the quantity not meeting standards. After discovering this situation, the commune leadership immediately took specific measures to solve it. Yangqiao Brigade urged the production teams to sow the seeds overnight, and as a result, all the first batch of rice seeds that had not been planted in the fields were sown the next day. After inspection and evaluation, Shishi Commune has pushed the current spring production to a new climax. At the commune members' representative meeting recently convened by the commune, the production plans for the whole commune and the major brigades today were re-studied and arranged. In order to further promote production, it was decided that the next stage will mainly compare the management of seedling fields, ensure that the seedlings are not damaged and not missing, ensure the quality of the seedlings, and ensure the preparation for rice transplanting.

    队队不落后　人人争上游
    石河公社竞赛热潮高
    本报合肥3日电　安徽省桐城县石河人民公社开展了全年竞赛、分段评比的全民生产竞赛运动。这个公社通过竞赛运动及时总结成绩，交流经验。号召各队学先进，赶先进，不断地把生产运动由一个高潮推向另一个高潮。
    石河公社党委在今年2月中旬，全面总结了1958年的生产经验，并在此基础上制订了今年全年的生产竞赛计划，在全社开展了生产竞赛运动。全年竞赛的主要内容是八比：比产量，比增产措施，比社员收入，比食堂等福利事业，比生产管理，比社员的思想觉悟，比干部参加生产和领导生产，比干部种试验田。除了全年的竞赛内容外，还根据各个不同的生产季节提出不同的竞赛内容，如春天比春耕准备工作，秋天就比秋收和耕、种。全公社十四个大队，一百六十一个小队，全部投入这个竞赛运动。公社半个月评选一次模范大队，大队五天至七天评选一次模范小队，年终进行总评。检查评比的办法是组织各队和社员代表全面看，重点查，边检查，边总结，边表扬，边批评，边改进。石河公社最近又进行了一次检查评比，共评选出余桥、汪洋、文昌、翻身、姚闸、合兴、交通等七个大队为模范队，其中余桥大队各项工作做得最好。
    最近，各生产大队掀起了学余桥，赶余桥的热潮，对生产起了很大推动作用。这次评比中较差的杨桥大队表示决心在下次评比中争上游。这次评比没有得到红旗的石河大队，当场就写下战表，一定要和模范队，分个上下。余桥大队表示决不自满，永远保住红旗。
    通过这次检查评比，公社领导上也发现了生产中的一些问题，例如有的队育秧进度较慢，有些秧田质量差，杂草没有除尽，下种不匀，数量不合标准。发现这一情况后，公社领导上立即采取具体措施，设法解决。杨桥大队连夜催各个生产小队下种，结果第二天就将第一批没有下田的稻种全部播下田。经过检查评比，石河公社已把当前的春季生产推向新高潮。在最近公社召开的社员代表会议上，全社和各大队今天的生产计划又重新进行了研究安排。为了把生产推进一步，决定下一阶段主要是比秧田管理工作，保证不坏秧，不缺秧，保证秧苗的质量，保证做好插秧的准备工作。　（王林祥　茀君）
