Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Rome Dispatch: A widespread protest movement is unfolding across Italy, protesting the agreement recently signed between Italy and the United States regarding the establishment of American medium-range missile bases on Italian territory.

    The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "l'Unità" published an editorial exposing the agreement's aggressive nature and its violation of Italian national interests. It pointed out that these missile bases are aimed at the Soviet Union. Therefore, "If irresponsible imperialist groups and warmongers engage in adventures in a certain area of Europe, our country (Italy) will face unavoidable retaliation."
      "l'Unità" called on all of Italy's most conscious forces and people to fight against the establishment of American missile bases in Italy.
    The General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Togliatti, wrote to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, demanding an investigation into the responsibility of government authorities in the signing of the Italian-American agreement.
    A group of Communist senators demanded that the government submit the Italian-American agreement to parliament for discussion.
    The leadership of the Italian Socialist Party, in a recent resolution, criticized the government's action of signing the missile base agreement behind the back of parliament as a violation of the constitution. It pointed out that this agreement "from a military and political point of view, puts Italy in a subordinate position in the relationship between the government and the American military authorities." It said that the establishment of American missile bases in Italy "effectively deprives the government and parliament of all rights to supervise the most important military measures on Italian territory."
    The "Peace Movement" in Italy has actively joined the struggle against the establishment of American missile bases in Italy. When a military parade commemorating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was held in Naples on the 2nd, activists of the "Italian Peace Movement" distributed many leaflets among the masses, which read: "No Missiles!" "Long Live Peace!" The Secretariat of the Italian Women's Union and the Bologna Provincial Committee of the Communist Party have both issued calls for the people to fight to defend peace and oppose the establishment of American missile bases.
    Even the Milanese bourgeois newspaper "Il Giorno" expressed concern about the signing of the Italian-American agreement. The newspaper believes that the current hope lies in forcing the government to strongly support various measures to ease international tensions. It said: "This is the only way to prevent Italy from becoming a front line of war."

    Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd, London Dispatch: The British government is following the United States in implementing the "Atlantic policy" aimed at preparing for nuclear war. This action is facing increasingly widespread and fierce opposition from people of all walks of life in British society.

    From March 27th to 30th this year, people from all walks of life in Britain once again took advantage of the Easter holiday to organize an unprecedented protest march against nuclear weapons, marching from Aldermaston, the British Atomic Weapons Research Centre, to London, a distance of one hundred and fifty li. The ranks expanded continuously along the way, and upon arrival in London, the number had increased from just over four thousand at the start to more than fifteen thousand, triple the number at the end of the first march from London to Aldermaston held last Easter.
    The recently concluded annual conference of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers also reflected the same demands. At the meeting, more than a thousand delegates representing 350,000 members of the union passed a resolution calling for a summit meeting to ease international tensions and to reach an agreement on the cessation of the manufacture, testing, and use of nuclear weapons. The resolution also condemned any attempt to arm West German troops with nuclear weapons.
    It is not difficult to understand why the British people so urgently demand the easing of international tensions and oppose preparations for nuclear war. The United States, under the pretext of "Atlantic strategic needs," has established more than thirty bases in Britain, stationing 50,000 troops, which cannot but make the British people feel the humiliation of the violation of national sovereignty. American planes carrying hydrogen bombs fly all over the British Isles, which cannot but make the British people feel the threat of nuclear destruction. In particular, the dangerous action of the United States in establishing medium-range ballistic missile bases in Britain, targeting the Soviet Union, and attempting to make Britain share the catastrophic consequences of its launching a nuclear war, has aroused even greater fear and anger among the British public. The British "Daily Worker" pointed out that the US-UK missile base agreement is a "suicidal treaty" for Britain.
    Therefore, even before the US-UK missile base agreement was announced, the Aberdeen branch of the Plumbers Union had declared that the work of building American missile launching bases in northern Scotland was a "sinful work" and that workers would never participate in "digging our own graves," even if they could never find work.
    The National Federation of Building Trade Operatives has also called on workers in local branches to refuse to work for American missile bases.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Oslo Dispatch: Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen and Danish Defense Minister Poul Hansen reiterated on the evening of the 3rd at a gathering in Oslo commemorating the tenth anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that their respective governments would not allow the establishment of missile bases on their territories.

    Gerhardsen pointed out in his speech that the Norwegian government's "decision made in 1957 against the storage of atomic weapons and the establishment of medium-range missile bases on Norwegian territory remains valid." Hansen also said: In the current situation, the Danish government does not wish to accept atomic weapons.
    This statement by the Norwegian Prime Minister and the Danish Defense Minister to some extent reflects the strong desire of the broad public in these countries to oppose turning their countries into atomic weapons bases, thereby inviting enormous danger. Norwegian Liberal Party MP Randall once pointed out: The United States' request to establish missile bases in Norway and Denmark, which border the Soviet Union, is to turn these countries into anti-Soviet battlefields. Many political and military figures in Nordic countries believe that only by implementing a neutral policy can the Nordic countries avoid the scourge of war.

    The broad public in Norway and Denmark not only oppose the establishment of American missile bases on their territories but also strongly oppose the expansion of the revived West German militarism into Northern Europe, because they have vivid memories of the harm this militarism caused to their countries. A few days ago, the Norwegian people held a protest rally in Oslo against West Germany's demand to station West German officers in the Nordic Command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to establish a West German naval supply base on the Norwegian coast. The Danish people also strongly oppose West Germany's attempt to expand its influence into Northern Europe through the merger of the Central European and Northern European commands of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    北大西洋侵略集团失尽人心
    意英两国人民强烈抗议同美国签订导弹基地协定
    挪丹广大公众反对西德军国主义势力向北欧扩张
    新华社4日讯　罗马消息：意大利全国各地正在展开广泛的抗议运动，抗议意大利和美国在不久以前所签订的关于在意大利境内建立美国中程导弹基地的协定。
    意大利共产党机关报“团结报”发表社论，揭露这个协定的侵略性质和违反意大利民族利益的性质。它指出，这些导弹基地是用来对付苏联的。因此，“一旦不负责任的帝国主义集团和好战分子在欧洲某个地区进行冒险，我国（意大利）人民就将遭到无可幸免的报复”。
      “团结报”号召意大利一切最有觉悟的力量和人民为反对在意大利建立美国导弹基地而斗争。
    意大利共产党总书记、众议院外交委员会委员陶里亚蒂写信给外交委员会主席，要求追查政府当局在签订美意协定问题上的责任。
    参议院的一批共产党议员要求政府把意美协定提交议会讨论。
    意大利社会党领导机构在最近通过的一项决议中指责政府背着议会签订导弹基地协定的作法违反了宪法。它指出，这个协定“从军事观点和政治观点来看，在政府和美国军事当局的关系中，意大利处于屈从地位。它说，在意大利建立美国导弹基地，“实际上是剥夺了政府和议会对在意大利领土上最重要的军事措施实行监督的一切权利。”
    意大利“和平运动”积极投入了反对在意大利建立美国导弹基地的斗争。当2日在那不勒斯举行纪念北大西洋集团成立十周年的阅兵式的时候，“意大利和平运动”的积极分子在群众中散发了许多传单，上面写着：“不要导弹！”“和平万岁！”意大利妇女联合会书记处和共产党波伦亚省委员会都发出号召，号召人民为维护和平、反对建立美国导弹基地而斗争。
    甚至米兰的资产阶级报纸“日报”也对签订意美协定一事表示忧虑。报纸认为，目前的希望在于迫使政府大力支持缓和国际紧张局势的各种措施。它说：“这是使意大利不致于成为战争前哨的唯一办法。”
    新华社3日讯　伦敦消息：英国政府追随美国，执行以准备发动核战争为目的的“大西洋政策”。这种行动正在遭到越来越广泛的英国社会各阶层人士猛烈的反对。
    今年3月27日到30日，英国各界人士又一次利用复活节假期，组织了盛况空前的反对核武器的抗议进军，从英国原子武器研究中心的阿尔德马斯顿一直步行到伦敦，行程一百五十华里，沿途队伍不断扩大，到达伦敦时已经由刚出发时的四千余人增加到一万五千余人，为去年复活节举行的从伦敦到阿尔德马斯顿的第一次进军结束时人数的三倍。
    刚刚结束的英国店员和送货工人工会年会，也反映了同样的要求。会上，代表这个工会三十五万会员的一千多个代表通过决议，要求举行最高级会议，以便缓和国际紧张局势，并且就停止制造、试验和使用核武器达成协议。决议还谴责以核武器武装西德军队的任何企图。
    英国人民如此迫切地要求缓和国际局势和反对准备核战争，这是不难理解的。美国借口
  “大西洋战略需要”而在英国建立基地三十多个，驻军五万人，这不能不使英国人感到国家主权被侵犯的屈辱。携带着氢弹的美国飞机在英伦三岛上空满天飞，这也不能不使英国人感到核毁灭力量的威胁。特别是美国在英国建立以苏联为攻击目标的中程弹道导弹基地，企图使英国分摊其发动核战争的灾难性后果的危险行动，更激起了英国公众的恐惧和愤怒。英国“工人日报”指出，美英导弹基地协定对英国来说是一项“自杀的条约”。
    因此，早在美英导弹基地协定公布之前，铅管工人工会亚伯丁分会就曾经宣布，在苏格兰北部建立美国导弹发射基地的工作是一种
  “罪恶工作”，工人们绝不参加“挖掘我们自己的坟墓”的工作，即使永找不到工作也绝不参加。
    英国全国建筑工人联合会也号召各地方分会的工人拒绝为美国导弹基地工作。
    新华社4日讯　奥斯陆消息：挪威首相基哈德森和丹麦国防大臣保·汉森3日晚在奥斯陆举行的纪念北大西洋集团十周年的集会上，一致重申两国政府不允许在两国领土上建立导弹基地的态度。
    基哈德森在讲话中指出，挪威政府“在1957年作出的关于反对在挪威领土上储存原子武器和建立中程导弹基地的决定仍然有效”。汉森也说：在目前的形势下，丹麦政府不希望接受原子武器。
    挪威首相和丹麦国防大臣的这种声明在一定程度上反映了这些国家广大公众强烈反对把它们的国家变为原子武器基地、从而招致巨大危险的愿望。挪威自由党议员兰达尔就曾经指出：美国要求在同苏联为邻的挪威和丹麦建立导弹基地，是要把这些国家变成反苏的战场。北欧国家许多政界和军界人士都认为，只有实行中立政策，才能使北欧国家不致遭到战争的祸害。
    挪威和丹麦的广大公众不仅反对在它们领土上建立美国的导弹基地，而且强烈反对复活起来的西德军国主义向北欧扩张势力，因为他们对这种军国主义对他们国家造成的祸害记忆犹新。前几天，挪威人民在奥斯陆举行了抗议大会，反对西德要求在北大西洋集团北欧司令部里安置西德军官，并且在挪威沿海建立西德海军供应基地。丹麦人民也强烈反对西德想通过北大西洋集团中欧和北欧司令部的合并来把它的势力扩大到北欧。
