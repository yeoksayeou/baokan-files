Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: American imperialism is colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in a new conspiracy to plunder our country's precious historical relics in Taiwan. Many prominent figures in China's cultural and educational circles recently gathered in Beijing to issue a serious warning, resolutely opposing the thieving behavior of American imperialism.

According to a recent report published by the Chiang gang's "Central Daily News" in Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, under the pretext of "going to Brazil in South America for a special exhibition," has "carefully selected a batch of antiques, traditional Chinese paintings, and historical documents" and is "about to ship" them to Brazil. The report did not reveal the names or quantities of the cultural relics being shipped to Brazil. Prior to this, according to reports from newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, American so-called "archaeologists," "collectors," and some military and government officials had repeatedly gone to Taiwan to "visit" antiques, secretly engaging in activities. Last year, Stanford University in the United States even proposed a so-called "loan," asking the Chiang Kai-shek clique to "transport" a batch of our country's precious cultural relics currently in Taiwan "to the United States," and declared that "if this can be done," it could arouse "great goodwill" from American imperialism. Shortly after Stanford University proposed the "loan," the Chiang Kai-shek clique decided to carefully select precious cultural relics to be shipped to Brazil, which is near the United States. It is very clear that this is a predetermined conspiracy by American imperialism to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to plunder our country's historical relics.

After learning of the above news, prominent figures in China's cultural and educational circles felt great indignation. At a recent gathering to oppose this conspiracy, Chen Yuan, Chen Shutong, Wang Yechiu, Jian Bozan, Xu Bingchang, Zeng Zhaoyu, Xia Nai, Pei Wenzhong, Huang Wenbi, Wu Zhongchao, Zhu Qiling, Wu Zuoren, Liu Kaiqu, Zhao Wanli, Chang Hui, and dozens of others delivered speeches. They unanimously pointed out that the more than 5,000 boxes of historical relics transported from Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai and other places to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek clique on the eve of the liberation of the Chinese mainland are all extremely valuable cultural heritage of our great motherland. The 650 million Chinese people will never allow the deliberate theft conspiracy of American imperialism to succeed. No matter where these precious cultural relics are robbed to, whether it be the ends of the earth, the Chinese people will definitely pursue and recover them. At the meeting, they also called on patriots and patriotic cultural workers in Taiwan to shoulder the responsibility of defending the motherland's cultural heritage and to smash the conspiracy of American imperialism.

    首都文教界著名人士集会
    反对美国从台湾劫夺我国的文物
    新华社7日讯　美帝国主义正在勾结蒋介石集团进行劫夺我国在台湾珍贵历史文物的新的阴谋活动。我国文教界许多著名人士最近曾在北京集会提出严重警告，坚决反对美帝国主义的盗窃行为。
    据台湾蒋帮“中央日报”最近发表的消息，蒋介石集团以“前往南美洲的巴西举行特别展览”为名，已“精选一批古物、国画文献”，“即将启运”巴西，消息丝毫没有透露启运巴西文物的名称和件数。在这以前，据香港和台湾的报纸消息透露，美国的所谓“考古家”、“收藏家”和一些文武官员，曾多次到台湾“参观”古物，暗中进行活动；去年，美国史丹福大学更提出所谓“商借”，要蒋介石集团把现存台湾的一批我国珍贵文物“运往美国”，并且宣称这件事“假如能做成”，可以引起美帝国主义“极大好感”。美国史丹福大学提出“商借”不久，蒋介石集团就决定精选珍贵文物启运邻近美国的巴西，很显然这是美帝国主义勾结蒋介石集团劫夺我国历史文物的预定阴谋。
    我国文教界著名人士获悉上述消息后，感到极大愤慨。在最近举行的反对这一阴谋的集会上，陈垣、陈叔通、王冶秋、翦伯赞、徐炳昶、曾昭燏、夏鼐、裴文中、黄文弼、吴仲超、朱启铃、吴作人、刘开渠、赵万里、常惠等数十人曾发表谈话。他们一致指出，我国大陆解放前夕被蒋介石集团从北京、南京、上海等地运往台湾的五千多箱历史文物，都是我们伟大祖国极其宝贵的文化遗产，六亿五千万中国人民决不容许美帝国主义蓄意盗窃的阴谋得逞，不论这些珍贵文物被劫往天涯海角，中国人民一定要把它们追回。会上，他们还号召台湾的爱国人士和爱国的文化工作者，担负起保卫祖国文化遗产的职责，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。
