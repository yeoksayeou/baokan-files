Let the Light of Freedom Shine Throughout Africa

　　Today, the Chinese people are warmly holding commemorative activities for "Africa Freedom Day." Not long ago, the Chinese people and the people of many countries in the world held "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," which was a huge political support for the heroic anti-colonial struggle of the African people. Now, only a few months later, the flames of the national liberation struggle are raging across the entire African continent, and the ideal of freedom and independence pursued by the African people for centuries is becoming a reality. Holding "Africa Freedom Day" at this time undoubtedly has particularly important significance. This great day clearly marks that people all over the world will unite more closely with the African people, hasten the death knell of the imperialist colonial system, and urge the birth of a new, independent, and free Africa.
　　Western colonialists have always boasted about the myth of spreading "Western civilization" in Africa; various apologists for colonialism have even fabricated fallacies that African colonies "exploit" the motherland and that colonialists "fatherly" bestowed "prosperity" and "civilization" on African colonies. However, the living, bloody history and reality of Africa powerfully expose the hypocrisy of so-called "Western civilization." What colonialism brought to Africa was: the annihilation of entire nations, the massacre of millions of people, with nearly 100 million Africans dying during the historical period of the slave trade alone; the destruction of the entire African economy, and the formation of a single-crop economy due to the implementation of forced planting systems; a very small number of white colonialists forcibly occupied 50%-80% of the fertile arable land of Africans, drove Africans to perform slave labor for foreign planters and colonial companies, and endlessly plundered Africa's mineral resources; dozens of prevalent racial discrimination laws, countless concentration camps imprisoning millions of Africans, and overcrowded prisons filled with terror and death; the lowest national income in the world, the highest infant mortality rate, and the most widespread epidemics; the destruction of national languages and traditional cultures, and more than 90% illiteracy... From its rise to its dying stage of imperialism, Western capitalism is permeated with the blood of the African people, and this is the great achievement of the "Western civilization" boasted by the colonialists in Africa!
　　However, those living on the land of Africa are by no means the ignorant barbarians who are willing to be slaves as described by the colonialists. The African people once had excellent civilizations like the Nile River basin, the Congo River basin, and Carthage; they once had outstanding national heroes such as Abd al-Qadir of Algeria, Mahdi and Samori of Sudan, and Queen Ranavalona of Madagascar, who led the people in stubborn wars against Western conquerors. During the long years of colonial rule, the African people never ceased their struggle against colonial oppression. After World War II, due to the significant weakening of imperialism, the emergence of the entire socialist camp, and the vigorous development of the national liberation movement of oppressed nations in Asia and around the world, the African people experienced a great awakening and began to take strong steps onto the international political stage. In particular, the convening of the Bandung Conference in 1954, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in 1957, and the African People's Conference in 1958 made the African people's national independence movement reach an unprecedented climax, and one African independent country after another was born. Looking at the African continent, eleven of the fifty-nine countries have gained independence, and more than two-fifths of the two hundred and forty million people have gotten rid of colonial rule. The African people's struggle for national independence and freedom has become an irresistible historical trend.
　　Since the beginning of spring this year, starting with the popular uprising in the Belgian Congo, the "stable oasis" of colonialism, followed by the outbreak of the anti-colonial struggles of the people of Nyasaland and Northern and Southern Rhodesia in the Central African Federation, a new chapter in the African national independence movement has begun. Affected by this, the people of British East Africa, the Union of South Africa, French West Africa, Portuguese Mozambique, and Belgian Ruanda-Urundi south of the equator have all been involved in struggles of varying scales, either striving for national independence, demanding democratic freedom, demanding increased wages, or opposing racial discrimination. The scale of the momentum, the breadth of the masses, and the persistence and tenacity of the struggle are all unprecedented. Especially in Nyasaland, under the suppression of the colonialists' bayonets and bullets, the struggle has lasted for nearly three months, with the masses using stones, sticks, and spears to fight against the fully armed colonialists, and the scope of the struggle covering the entire territory of Nyasaland. Surrounding the struggle of the people of Nyasaland, the resistance movements of the people of Central Africa, East Africa, and South Africa have risen one after another, wave after wave, greatly shaking the Western colonial system. Faced with the new situation of the African national revolutionary storm, Western colonialists have to exclaim that a prairie fire has ignited on the African continent!
　　The current situation in Africa shows that the African people have gradually embarked on the path of political and organizational maturity in their own struggle practice. The banner of national independence is becoming more and more distinct, and the leading organizations of the national movement are also becoming more and more sound. The formation of the emerging working class in Africa and the establishment of the General Union of Black African Workers, which has 200,000 members, have further promoted the development and growth of the African workers' movement. This is a new and important factor in the current African national liberation movement. At the same time, the peasant movement will increasingly show its special importance. In African colonies, the land issue, like labor-capital issues in enterprises, is closely linked to the task of national revolution. In Nyasaland, 70% of the arable land has been plundered by the colonialists. Precisely because of this, the broad masses of peasants actively participated in the struggle against colonialism. The uprising of one million Kikuyu people in Kenya in 1952 was basically a movement of peasants demanding the return of land. The resounding slogan of "Take back the land stolen by the white people" powerfully mobilized the peasants to participate in the struggle for national independence. Today, in Algeria and Cameroon, the broad masses of peasants have successively participated in the sacred national liberation war, becoming the main force of the people's armed forces and guerrillas. The practice of the African people's struggle will further prove that the united front of broad strata such as workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie is a reliable guarantee for achieving victory in the cause of national liberation.
　　In Africa, armed struggles and non-armed political struggles of the people against colonial rule coexist. In order to create excuses for their bloody suppression and massacres, Western colonialists are trying their best to slander Africans for using violence. Even the colonial authorities in Nyasaland fabricated documents, spreading rumors that Africans wanted to "massacre" white people. The clumsiness of this method even shocked the British bourgeois press. African leaders have repeatedly pointed out that their goal is for Africans to manage their own affairs and do not want to provoke racial genocide. On the contrary, it is the Western colonial authorities who deliberately provoke racial genocide. They instigated white immigrants to massacre Africans. In the Congo, Togo, Central Africa, and East Africa, Belgian, French, and British colonialists have mobilized a large number of colonial troops and used machine guns, armored vehicles, and even "vampire" bombers to suppress and massacre unarmed African people. So, since the colonialists have used the most barbaric violence, why don't the African people have the right to use violence against the colonial rulers who are carrying out armed suppression against them? The people have always loved peace, and whether they adopt violent means in the struggle for freedom largely depends on the colonialists. If the colonialists stubbornly adhere to the policy of armed suppression and massacre, then, when conditions are ripe, the vast African colonial people will, like the heroic Algerian and Cameroonian people, not hesitate to launch a heroic armed struggle against the barbaric colonialists.
　　Of course, historical experience proves that imperialism and all reactionaries will never automatically withdraw from the political stage. Western colonialists in Africa are carrying out bloody suppression, massacres, and large-scale arrests on the one hand, attempting to carry out a frenzied struggle; at the same time, they are playing with so-called "legislative council elections," adding a few African legislators as decorations; they are also formulating some "reform" plans to carry out political deception on the African people. When all else fails, the colonialists will change their faces and use tricks such as the Euro-African or Franco-African "community" to continue to maintain their colonial rule. However, the awakened African people cannot be defeated or deceived. As Guinean Prime Minister Touré, whose country recently gained independent status, pointed out, the Euro-African "community" is essentially "expanding Europe to Africa," and Europeans must abandon this idea. Africa can only be Africa for Africans!
　　It should be emphasized here that while Western colonialists such as Britain and France are doing their best to carry out bloody suppression against the African people in order to maintain their colonial rule, American imperialism is colluding with these old colonial countries under the guise of "anti-colonialism" in order to strangle the African national liberation movement and attempt to further meddle in African colonies and carry out Wall Street's colonial expansion. According to American news agencies, Britain is planning an aggressive military bloc, a "mini-NATO," in Africa; France will also propose a so-called plan to "defend" Africa. And in these military blocs and plans aimed at suppressing the people of all African countries, the United States will play an "active role." Recently, Irving, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Affairs of the U.S. Department of Defense, led Department of Defense officials to South Africa for suspicious activities. He even talked about the important position of South Africa "in the overall strategy of Western countries." Everyone knows that American imperialism has always been hostile to the liberation movement of the African colonial people. In Algeria and Cameroon, the United States supports dirty colonial wars with weapons and dollars; the United States maintains military bases in some African countries, threatening the independence and peace of African countries; American monopoly capital intensifies its infiltration into Africa, extracting astonishing profits from Africa together with those old colonial companies; the United States uses all means inside and outside the United Nations to obstruct the people of all African countries from moving towards true independence. American imperialists never condemn Western barbaric colonialism, but instead praise African colonial rulers as "enlightened" or "benevolent" colonialists. The Asian people have long recognized that American imperialism is the most insidious and ferocious enemy of all oppressed nations; the African people will also increasingly recognize this point. Recently, the Cameroonian People's Union sternly criticized the actions of the United States, a colonialist, in a broadcast statement, saying, "The United States is really not doing good things in Africa, only doing things that harm others and benefit itself... Now the United States wants to replace the French and British colonialists and carry out undemocratic colonial conspiracies under the title of 'standard-bearer of democracy'."
　　Under the current situation, the African people's anti-colonialist struggle will inevitably encounter many difficulties and obstacles, and the struggle will still be very arduous and tortuous. However, as long as the people of all African countries strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, no difficulty can stop the African people from moving towards the road to victory. Western colonialists are doing everything possible to incite racial hatred and disputes among Africans in order to create division in the African national liberation movement. This conspiracy has aroused the serious vigilance of the African people. The All-African People's Conference has issued a resounding slogan to the African people: "African people unite! What we lose are only shackles, and what we will regain is the entire continent."
　　Our era is an era in which imperialism and the colonial system are bound to perish, and the just cause of the people all over the world against imperialism is bound to win. The national liberation struggle of the African people has the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace forces of the world. The Chinese people have always regarded sympathy for and support for the liberation cause of the world's oppressed nations as their lofty international obligation. We firmly believe that dawn will surely break in Africa, and the light of freedom and independence will surely shine all over the land of Africa!

### 让自由的光芒照遍全非洲

　　让自由的光芒照遍全非洲
    今天，中国人民热烈地举行“非洲自由日”的纪念活动。不久以前，中国人民和世界上许多国家的人民举行了“帝国主义滚出非洲日”，这对非洲人民英勇的反殖民主义斗争，是一次政治上的巨大的支持。现在仅仅过了几个月，非洲整个大陆上民族解放斗争的烈火熊熊，非洲人民几世纪来追求自由和独立的理想正在变成现实。在这个时候举行“非洲自由日”，无疑具有特别重大的意义，这个伟大的日子鲜明地标志着全世界人民将同非洲人民更紧密地团结一起，敲紧帝国主义殖民制度的丧钟，催促一个独立自由的新非洲的诞生。
    西方殖民主义者一向夸耀他们在非洲传播“西方文明”的神话；殖民主义的形形色色的辩护士们甚至制造了非洲殖民地“剥削”宗主国本土和殖民主义者“慈父般地”赐予非洲殖民地以“繁荣”、“文明”等等的谬论。但是活生生的、血淋淋的非洲的历史和现实有力地揭下了所谓“西方文明”的画皮。殖民主义带给非洲的是：整个民族被消灭，千百万人民遭到屠杀，仅仅在贩卖奴隶的历史时期就有近一亿非洲人口死亡；整个非洲的经济遭到破坏，由于强迫种植制的推行而形成了单一作物经济；极少数白种殖民者强占了非洲人50％—80％的肥沃的耕地，驱使非洲人为外国种植园主和殖民公司进行奴隶劳动，无止境地掠夺非洲人的矿产资源；几十种盛行的种族歧视法令，囚禁千百万非洲人的难以胜计的集中营，人满为患，充满着恐怖和死亡的牢房；世界上最低的国民收入、最高的婴儿死亡率、蔓延最广的流行病；民族语文和传统文化被摧残，90％以上的文盲……。西方资本主义从它的兴起到它的垂死阶段帝国主义，都浸透了非洲人民的鲜血，而这就是殖民主义者所吹嘘的“西方文明”在非洲的丰功伟绩！
    但是，在非洲的土地上生活着的绝不是像殖民主义者所描绘的野蛮无知、甘当奴隶的顺民。非洲人民曾经有过像尼罗河流域、刚果河流域及迦太基的优秀的文明；曾经有过像阿尔及利亚的阿布·卡迪尔、苏丹的马赫迪和萨摩利、马达加斯加的女王兰那瓦朗纳等的杰出的民族英雄，他们曾经领导人民向西方征服者进行过顽强的战争。在这殖民统治的漫长的年代里，非洲人民没有停止过反抗殖民压迫的斗争。第二次世界大战以后，由于帝国主义遭到重大的削弱，整个社会主义阵营的出现，亚洲和全世界被压迫民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，非洲人民经历了伟大的觉醒，并开始迈开雄健的步伐，登上国际政治舞台。特别是1954年万隆会议、1957年亚非人民团结大会及1958年非洲人民大会的召开，使得非洲人民的民族独立运动达到了空前的高涨，一个接着一个的非洲独立国家诞生了。放眼非洲大陆，五十九个国家中已经有十一个获得了独立，两亿四千万人口中已经有五分之二以上摆脱了殖民统治。非洲人民争取民族独立和自由的斗争已经成为一股不可抗拒的历史潮流。
    今年开春以来，从殖民主义的“安定的绿洲”、比属刚果的人民暴动开始，接着是中非联邦尼亚萨兰、南北罗得西亚人民的反殖民主义斗争的爆发，揭开了非洲民族独立运动的新的篇章。影响所及，英属东非、南非联邦、法属西非、葡属莫三鼻给、比属卢安达—乌隆迪等赤道以南黑非洲人民都卷入了规模不同的斗争，或争取民族独立，或要求民主自由，或要求增加工资，或反对种族歧视。其声势的浩大，群众性的广泛，斗争的持续和坚韧，都是前所少有的。特别是在尼亚萨兰，在殖民者的刺刀和枪弹的镇压下，斗争已持续了将近三个月，群众用石头、棍棒、长矛抗击全副武装的殖民者，斗争的范围遍及尼亚萨兰全境。围绕着尼亚萨兰人民的斗争，中非、东非、南非各国人民的反抗运动彼落此起，后浪推前浪，一浪接一浪，大大地震撼着西方的殖民体系。面临着非洲民族革命风暴的新形势，西方殖民主义者不得不惊呼非洲大陆上燃烧起了燎原的大火！
    当前非洲的形势表明，非洲人民在自己的斗争实践中已经走上了政治上和组织上逐步成熟的道路。民族独立的旗帜越来越鲜明，民族运动的领导组织也越来越健全。非洲新兴的工人阶级队伍的形成，拥有二十万会员的黑非洲工人总联合会的成立，进一步促进了非洲工人运动的发展和壮大。这是当前非洲民族解放运动中出现的一个新的重要因素。同时，农民运动也将越来越显示它的特殊的重要性。在非洲殖民地，土地问题和企业劳资问题一样，是与民族革命的任务紧密地联系着的。在尼亚萨兰，70％的耕地被殖民者所掠夺，正因为这样，广大的农民群众积极地参加了反抗殖民主义的斗争。 1952年怯尼亚一百万吉古宇族人民的起义，基本上也是一个农民要求收回土地的运动。“把白种人偷去的土地夺回来”的响亮的口号曾有力地动员了农民参加争取民族独立的斗争。今天在阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆，广大的农民前仆后继地参加了神圣的民族解放战争，成为人民武装部队和游击队的主要力量。非洲人民斗争的实践将会进一步证明，工人、农民、知识分子和民族资产阶级等的广泛阶层的统一战线，是取得民族解放事业胜利的可靠的保证。
    在非洲，人民反抗殖民统治的武装斗争和非武装的政治斗争同时存在。西方殖民主义者为了给他们的血腥镇压和屠杀制造借口，正在竭力污蔑非洲人使用暴力，甚至像尼亚萨兰的殖民当局竟伪造文件，造谣说非洲人想要“屠杀”白种人。这种手段的拙劣连英国的资产阶级报刊都为之乍舌。非洲人的领袖们曾一再指出，他们的目标是要非洲人管理自己的事务，并不想挑起种族残杀。相反，蓄意挑起种族残杀的是西方殖民当局，他们唆使白种移民去屠杀非洲人，在刚果、多哥、中非和东非等地，比利时、法国、英国殖民者都调动了大量的殖民军队，并使用机关枪、装甲车以至“吸血鬼”轰炸机去镇压和屠杀手无寸铁的非洲人民。那么，既然殖民者使用了最野蛮的暴力，为什么非洲人民就没有权利对向他们进行武装镇压的殖民统治者使用暴力呢？人民从来都是爱好和平的，他们在争取自由的斗争中是否采用暴力手段在很大程度上取决于殖民主义者。如果殖民者顽固地坚持武力镇压和屠杀政策，那么，当条件成熟的时候，广大的非洲殖民地人民终会像英勇的阿尔及利亚人民和喀麦隆人民一样，毫不犹豫地向野蛮的殖民者展开英勇的武装斗争。
    当然，历史经验证明，帝国主义和一切反动派决不会自动地退出政治舞台。西方殖民主义者在非洲一面进行血腥的镇压、屠杀和大规模的逮捕，妄图进行疯狂的挣扎；同时又玩弄着所谓“立法会议选举”，增加寥寥几名非洲人议员作为装饰；还制定一些什么“改革”方案对非洲人民进行政治欺骗。到万不得已的时候，殖民者就改头换面用什么欧非或者法非“共同体”之类的把戏，以继续维护其殖民统治。但是，已经觉醒了的非洲人民，是打不倒也骗不了的。正如新近取得独立地位的几内亚共和国总理杜尔所指出：欧非“共同体”实质上是“把欧洲扩张到非洲”，欧洲人必须放弃这个念头。非洲只能是非洲人的非洲！
    这里应该强调指出，在英法等西方殖民主义者竭力对非洲人民进行血腥镇压，以维护其殖民统治的时候，美帝国主义正在披着“反殖民主义”的外衣与这些老牌殖民国家勾结一起，以扼杀非洲的民族解放运动，并企图进一步染指非洲殖民地，进行华尔街的殖民扩张事业。据美国通讯社透露，英国正在非洲策划一个“小型北大西洋公约组织”的侵略性军事集团；法国也将提出一个所谓“保卫”非洲的计划。而在这些旨在镇压非洲各国人民的军事集团和计划中，美国将起“积极作用”。最近美国国防部负责国际事务助理部长欧文曾率领国防部官员到南非进行可疑的活动，他甚至谈到了南非“在西方国家的全盘战略中”的重要地位。大家都知道，美帝国主义从来都敌视非洲殖民地人民的解放运动，在阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆，美国用武器和美元支持肮脏的殖民战争；美国在一些非洲国家保有军事基地，威胁着非洲国家的独立与和平；美国垄断资本加紧渗入非洲与那些老牌殖民公司一起从非洲榨取惊人的利润；美国在联合国内外使用一切手段阻挠非洲各国人民走向真正的独立，美帝国主义者从来也不谴责西方野蛮的殖民主义，而相反把非洲的殖民统治者誉为“开明的”或者“仁慈的”殖民主义者。亚洲人民早已认清了美帝国主义是一切被压迫民族的最阴险、最凶恶的敌人；非洲人民同样会越来越认清这一点。最近喀麦隆人民联盟在广播声明中严正地斥责了美国这种殖民主义者的作为，它说，“美国在非洲实在是不干好事，只干损人利己的勾当。……现在美国又想要代替法英殖民主义者，在‘民主旗手’的称号下进行不民主的殖民主义阴谋”。
    在目前形势下，非洲人民的反殖民主义斗争不可避免地还会遇到许多困难和障碍，斗争还会是十分艰巨和曲折的。但是，只要非洲各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，任何困难都不能阻挡住非洲人民走向胜利的道路。西方殖民主义者正在想尽一切办法，挑拨非洲人之间的种族仇视和纷争，以制造非洲民族解放运动的分裂。这个阴谋已经引起非洲人民的严重警惕。全非人民大会曾向非洲人民发出了响亮的口号：“非洲人民团结起来！我们失去的只是枷锁，我们将重新得到的是整个大陆”。
    我们的时代，是帝国主义和殖民制度必亡，全世界人民反对帝国主义的正义事业必胜的时代。非洲人民的民族解放斗争有着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界和平力量的强大的支持。中国人民一向把同情和支持世界被压迫民族的解放事业当作自己崇高的国际义务。我们坚决相信，非洲必将破晓，自由和独立的光芒必将普照非洲的大地！
