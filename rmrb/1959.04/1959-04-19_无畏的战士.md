Fearless Warriors
　　Xue Enhou
Last year, when I accompanied the Beijing literary and art circles to the Fujian front to express our condolences to the torpedo boat units, I heard many inspiring heroic deeds. At that time, we all had a common feeling: these heroic deeds were rarely reflected on the theatrical stage.

The recently performed "Nameless Island" by the China Youth Art Theatre reflects the heroic struggle of the navy on the Fujian front, making people feel very fresh and is a gratifying performance.

The success of "Nameless Island" lies in shaping the heroic image of the People's Navy and exposing the ugly faces of the enemy. Many parts of the play are very touching, such as the beginning of the play, which depicts our Lieutenant Instructor Wang Yongzhi, torpedo hand Lin Maocai, and all the officers and soldiers of the boat using their speedboat to destroy the enemy's warship "Taicheng" and then jumping into the turbulent waves. Generally speaking, it is difficult to express such thrilling scenes on the theatrical stage, but after the creation of the stage art workers of Qingyi, the stage atmosphere at that time was very real, highlighting the heroic spirit of the naval heroes fighting the sea, making people feel thrilling. When Wang Yongzhi and Lin Maocai overcame the sea with unremitting perseverance and climbed onto the reef, they killed the enemy who fell into the sea at the same time and captured the enemy's gunner. On this reef that could only accommodate three people, a struggle against the enemy unfolded; the brave and fearless, humorous naval fighters in the author's pen formed a sharp contrast with the greedy, fearful, and distraught enemy. The heroic images of Wang Yongzhi and Lin Maocai immediately jumped out, fully demonstrating the optimistic spirit of the People's Liberation Army.

Even more touching is that Wang Yongzhi still resolutely implemented the Party's policy on prisoners of war at the critical moment of life and death, in the midst of extreme danger. They gave the prisoners dry food and water first; they gave the prisoners life jackets to wear; and they constantly conducted class education on the prisoners. Under the influence of their words and deeds, the prisoners went from fear, hesitation, and escape to resolute surrender. Here, the noble humanitarian spirit of the heroic figures is fully depicted.

The author skillfully arranged the struggle between the enemy and ourselves on a desolate island, which made the dramatic conflict even more thrilling and acute, thereby further portraying the heroism and resourcefulness of the heroic figures. In the case of more enemies than us and a disparity in strength, a miracle of fighting more with less was created.

Through the heroic behavior on "Nameless Island", we further realized that the characteristic of heroes is that they can listen to the Party's words under any circumstances, such as Wang Yongzhi's implementation of the policy on prisoners of war, and it was very successful. The struggle against the enemy must be carried out correctly under the guidance of the Party's ideology: that is, the combination of tenacious fighting spirit and calm analysis of the enemy's situation; at the same time, we must rely on the masses, as shown in the play, relying on the fishermen. From the actions of Wang Yongzhi and Lin Maocai, we can see that they never considered personal gains or losses in any difficult situation. Their most noble quality is love for the motherland, love for the Party, and love for the people.

Speaking of this, I once again think of when we contacted the soldiers last year and expressed our condolences to them. The soldiers always answered in unison: "Serve the people!" After watching "Nameless Island," the meaning of this sentence is even more profound. The heroic figures in "Nameless Island" wrote about these noble qualities. Therefore, it gives people a great inspiration and education on the understanding of the communist style.

The comrades of the China Youth Art Theatre used a very short time to put on "Nameless Island", and this kind of enthusiasm is worthy of our learning. I think "Nameless Island" is still too loose in structure and not concentrated enough; in addition to the enemy ship gunner Sun Gui, who is more completely written, the other characters are not portrayed vividly enough. I hope to further process it to make this play more complete.

　　无畏的战士
　　薛恩厚
    去年我随北京市文艺界赴福建前线慰问团到前方慰问鱼雷快艇部队的时候，听到过不少可歌可泣的英雄事迹。当时，我们都有一个共同感觉：这些英雄事迹在戏剧舞台上还很少反映。
    最近中国青年艺术剧院演出的“无名岛”，正是反映了福建前方海军的英勇斗争事迹，使人看了感到非常新鲜，是一个可喜的演出。
    “无名岛”的成功之处在于塑造了人民海军的英雄形象，并揭露了敌人的丑恶嘴脸。有很多地方的戏非常感动人，如戏一开始就描绘出我上尉指导员王永智，鱼雷手林茂才和全艇指战员用自己的快艇炸毁了敌人“太成”号军舰后，跳入惊涛骇浪。一般地说，表现这样的惊险场面在戏剧舞台上是有困难的，然而经过了青艺舞台美术工作者的创造，当时的舞台气氛是很真实的，烘托了海军英雄与大海搏斗的英雄气魄，使人感到惊心动魄。当王永智和林茂才以不懈的毅力战胜了大海爬上礁石，在礁石上把同时落海的敌人击毙，俘获了敌舰炮长的时候，就在这仅容三人的礁石上展开了对敌斗争；作者笔下的英勇无畏、谈笑风生的海军战士，与贪生怕死、丧魂失魄的敌人恰恰形成了鲜明的对比，王永智、林茂才的英雄形象立即跃然触目，充分地表现了人民解放军的乐观主义精神。
    更动人的是王永智在生死关头、万分危急之际，依然坚决地执行了党的俘虏政策。他们把干粮和水先让俘虏吃；把救生衣让给俘虏穿；随时对俘虏进行阶级教育。在他们的言行感化之下，使俘虏从畏惧、动摇、逃跑到坚决地投降。这里，充分地描绘了英雄人物的崇高的人道主义精神。
    作者巧妙地将敌我斗争安排在一个荒无人烟的小岛上，这就使戏剧冲突愈显得惊险、尖锐，从而进一步地刻划了英雄人物的英勇机智。在敌众我寡、力量悬殊的情况下，创造出以少胜多的战斗奇迹。
    通过“无名岛”上的英雄行为，使我们进一步体会到英雄的特色是无论在任何情况下都能作到听党的话，如王永智对俘虏政策的执行，并且很成功。对敌斗争必须在党的指导思想下正确地进行：那就是顽强的斗志与冷静地分析敌情相结合；同时要依靠群众，如剧中所表现的依靠渔民，从王永智、林茂才的行动中可以看到，他们不管在任何困难的情况下，根本没考虑过个人得失，他们的最崇高的品质是热爱祖国、热爱党、热爱人民。
    谈到这里，又联想起去年我们接触战士时，向他们道辛苦的时候，战士们总是异口同声的回答：“为人民服务！”看了“无名岛”以后再回忆起这句话的意义就更加深刻了。“无名岛”中的英雄人物写出了这些高贵的品质。因此给人对共产主义风格的认识有很大的启发和教育。
    中国青年艺术剧院的同志们用了很短的时间排出了“无名岛”，这种干劲是值得我们学习的。我觉得“无名岛”在结构上尚嫌松散，不够集中；反面人物除敌舰炮长孙贵写的较完整外，其余的人物刻划的还不够鲜明。希望进一步加工，使这个戏更加完整。
