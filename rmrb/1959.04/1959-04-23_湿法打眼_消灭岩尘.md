Wet Drilling Eliminates Rock Dust

When blasting holes for tunneling in well lanes, the high-speed drilling of powerful rock drills causes rock dust to fly, seriously affecting the health of workers. As early as 1956, the Kailuan Coal Mine implemented wet drilling (i.e., water-flushed drilling), fundamentally eliminating the main source of rock dust. Last year, they also created water-flushed electric drills, eliminating the main source of rock dust or coal dust in semi-coal-rock and all-coal work surfaces. The rock dust in the mine's roadways has been reduced from hundreds of milligrams per cubic meter of air to four to six milligrams. However, this is still one to two times higher than the national standard of two milligrams. Therefore, they have adopted comprehensive dust prevention measures, including using sprayers to create water curtains after blasting, washing the roadway working surfaces and roof and floor with water, continuously sprinkling water before and during rock loading, adding salt wetting agents to the water, cleaning ventilation, etc. As a result, the rock dust on the mine's tunneling faces has been reduced to below the national standard, and the coal dust on the mining faces has been reduced to below ten milligrams per cubic meter, creating good working conditions for the workers. Currently, the tunneling efficiency of the entire mining area has increased by 18%-28% compared to the past, the footage has increased by 54%-100% compared to last year, and the cost has decreased by 4.6%-10%.

    湿法打眼　消灭岩尘
    打炮眼开凿井巷的时候，由于强力的凿岩机高速地钻进，岩粉飞扬，严重地影响工人的健康。开滦煤矿，早在1956年起就推行湿法打眼（即风水钻）法，从根本上消灭了岩尘的主要来源；去年又创造了水打眼的电钻，在半煤岩和全煤的工作面内，消灭了岩尘或煤尘的主要来源。这个矿的巷道岩尘已经由每立方公尺空气中含数百毫克降低到四至六毫克。但是还比国家标准二毫克高一至二倍。于是，他们又采取综合性的防尘措施，在放炮后用喷雾器形成水幕，用水冲洗巷道工作面和顶底帮，装岩前和装岩中不断洒水，在水内加食盐湿润剂，清洁通风等等。这样，全矿区掘进工作面的岩尘已降低到国家标准以下，回采工作面的煤尘也已降低到每立方公尺含有十毫克以下，为工人创造了良好的工作条件。现在全矿区的掘进效率较前提高了18％—28％，进尺较去年提高54％—100％，成本降低4.6％—10％。
