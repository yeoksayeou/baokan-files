　　Letters Filled with Respect

    "The flames destroyed Sister Xiang's body, but they can never destroy Xiang Xiuli, who lives in our hearts. Sister Xiang's excellent qualities and heroic actions often appear before our eyes, and each appearance adds new strength to us. When we encounter difficulties in our studies, we think of how Sister Xiang treated difficulties. Then we feel a huge force pushing us, our confidence is enhanced, and the difficulties are scared away."

    These are the words from a letter written to Xiang Xiuli's mother by eighteen third-year students from the French Department of the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute. When the reporter entered the Guangzhou Hejigong Pharmaceutical Factory, where Xiang Xiuli worked, several staff members were busy sorting through stacks of letters sent from all over the country. They said that since the heroic deeds of Xiang Xiuli's self-sacrificing fire rescue were publicized, enthusiastic and respectful letters like these have been pouring in like snowflakes every day. People affectionately call Xiang's mother their "good mother" in their letters. Many Young Pioneers and young students have also sent their beloved red scarves, commemorative albums, self-made portraits of Xiang Xiuli, and guarantees to strive to become "Xiang Xiuli Classes" and "Xiang Xiuli Assault Teams" to Xiang's mother, earnestly expressing their desire to learn from Xiang Xiuli and train themselves to become people with Xiang Xiuli's strong will, who regard the interests of the Party and the country as higher than everything else. Yu Haizhong, a young worker from the Nanchang Cable Factory, also attached a photo to his letter, saying, "Dear Mom, although you have lost a heroic daughter, thousands upon thousands of young people will be your good sons and daughters. Please accept my request and let me be your son! I will definitely be like my sister in my studies, actively studying technology and humbly learning skills from veteran masters. I will definitely work like my sister, selflessly, and always listen to the Party and follow the Party forever."

　　A Textbook of Communism

    The Xiang Xiuli Deeds Exhibition has been on display at the Guangzhou Youth Cultural Palace for more than a month, but there are still more than 200,000 people who have made reservations to visit. On this day, when I entered the exhibition hall with the surging crowd, I saw young workers, students, soldiers, Young Pioneers, elderly people with white hair, and housewives carrying their children. Xiang Xiuli's heroic deeds deeply moved all the visitors. Some listened quietly to the explanations of the staff with tears in their eyes, and some took notes word by word. Many of them came from towns and villages all over Guangdong, and even from provinces thousands of miles away. Several visitors from Jiangmen City visited the exhibition for several days in a row, copying and transcribing every picture and every article, and taking photos of various exhibits to take back for exhibition. Teachers from the Gaoyao County Party School of the Communist Party of China have also compiled Xiang Xiuli's deeds into a textbook of communism, preparing to use it to educate the next generation.

    Xiang Xiuli's heroic deeds are indeed an excellent textbook of communism. When people visit the exhibition, they cannot help but compare themselves with Xiang Xiuli's communist spirit. Sun Qiu, the young conductor of the No. 60 Youth Car of the Guangzhou Public Bus Company, after visiting the exhibition, recalled that although he had made some achievements in production with the help of the Party and Youth League organizations and became an advanced producer, he had some incorrect ideas: he was focused on how to improve his skills and was not very enthusiastic about social work. After visiting the exhibition, he excitedly said: I am determined to be a good son and daughter of the Party like Xiang Xiuli, always listen to the Party, and always be a promoter and shock worker of the Great Leap Forward.

    At Xiang's Mother's Home

    When the reporter visited Xiang Xiuli's home, Xiang Xiuli's mother was chatting intimately with an elderly female guest. At first, I guessed they might be relatives, but later Xiang's mother told me that they were just old neighbors. Since her beloved daughter Xiang Xiuli gloriously sacrificed herself, some people who knew her, or did not know her, have taken care of her in every possible way. When she is alone at home, the neighbors often come to accompany her, fearing that she will feel lonely. Earlier, a group of young people who had come to Guangzhou from Shashi, Hubei Province, to visit the Xiang Xiuli Exhibition, enthusiastically recognized her as their mother when they visited her and took photos with her. Xiang's mother said excitedly: Now people are calling me mother everywhere, and I really feel both honored and comforted.

    Every morning, as Xiang's mother was about to pick up her vegetable basket to go to the market to buy vegetables, the salespersons in the market would deliver the vegetables to her door. When she went to buy rice, the workers at the rice store said: "Mom Xiang, go back! I'll deliver it to you." The Young Pioneers loved Mom Xiang even more. A group of Young Pioneers from Xiaobei Hongqiao Street Elementary School would run over whenever they were free to wash clothes and mop the floor for Mom Xiang.

    Tens of Thousands of Xiang Xiulis are Growing Up

    Before the Spring Festival, the Fifth Bridge Engineering Division of the Zhujiang Bridge Engineering Bureau had the following incident: Apprentice Tang Wenkui was a junior high school student who originally thought that being a crane operator was "unpromising." On this day, after hearing about Xiang Xiuli's heroic deeds, he said painfully: "Xiang Xiuli dedicated her life to the cause of socialist construction. Why can't I, a junior high school student, be a crane operator?" Once, the steel sheet piles of the bridge pier were submerged by the tide, affecting construction. He immediately jumped into the cold river water to tie up the steel sheet piles. Apprentice Li Xiangbing's family wanted him to go home for the Spring Festival, but he said: "How did Xiang Xiuli treat her work? How can I put down production and go home?" Some people in this engineering department originally only chose easy work. After learning about Xiang Xiuli's heroic deeds, they are now not only competing to do heavy work, but also using their spare time and holidays to repair roads and unload stone materials to speed up transportation work. In February, the entire department overfulfilled its production tasks.

    Now, similar examples are constantly appearing in various places. These examples show that although Xiang Xiuli sacrificed herself for the country, tens of thousands of Xiang Xiulis are constantly growing up.

　　向秀丽活在人们心里
　　新华社记者  岑荔丹
　　充满敬意的信件
    “烈火毁坏了向姐姐的身体，但永远毁不了活在我们心里的向秀丽。向姐姐的优秀品质和英雄行为，常常展现在我们的眼前，每次的出现都给我们增添了新的力量。当我们在学习中遇到困难的时候，我们就想起了向姐姐是怎样对待困难的，于是我们就感到有一股巨大的力量在推动自己，信心增强了，困难也就吓跑了。”
    这是北京外国语学院法文系三年级十八位学生写给向秀丽妈妈信中的话。记者走进向秀丽生前工作的广州何济公制药厂时，看到几个工作人员正在忙碌地整理着一叠叠从全国各地寄来的信件。他们说，自从向秀丽舍身救火的英勇事迹传出去后，像这样充满热情和敬意的来信，每天就似雪片一样地飞来。人们在信里亲热地称呼向妈妈为自己的“好妈妈”，不少少先队员、青年学生还把自己心爱的红领巾、纪念册、自制的向秀丽画像，和争取成为“向秀丽班”、“向秀丽突击队”的保证书送给向妈妈，热诚地表示要好好学习向秀丽，把自己锻炼成为具有向秀丽那种有坚强意志，把党和国家利益看成高于一切的人。南昌市电缆厂的青年工人余海钟在来信中还附了一张照片，他在信中说：“亲爱的妈妈，虽然你失去了一个英雄的女儿，但会有千千万万的青年人做您的好儿女的。请您接受我的请求，让我做您的儿子吧！我一定要在学习中像姐姐一样地积极钻研技术，虚心向老师傅学本领；我一定要在工作中像姐姐一样忘我地劳动，永远听党的话，永远跟着党走。”
　　共产主义的教材
    向秀丽事迹展览会已经在广州市青年文化宫展出一个多月了，但是预约参观的人还有二十多万。这天，我随着汹涌的人流走进展览馆时，见到观众中有青年工人、学生、战士、少先队员，也有须发皆白的老年人和背着孩子的家庭主妇。向秀丽的英雄事迹深深地感动了所有的观众，他们有的含着满眶热泪在静听工作人员的讲解，有的拿着笔记本在逐字逐句地记录。他们当中有不少是从广东各地城镇、农村甚至从远隔千里的外省赶来参观的。来自江门市的几个观众，一连到展览会参观了几天，将这里的每一幅图画、每一篇文章都临摹、抄写下来；把展出的各种实物摄成照片，准备带回去展览。中共高要县党校的教师，还把向秀丽的事迹编写成共产主义教材，准备用它来教育后一代。
    向秀丽的英雄事迹，的确是极好的共产主义教材。人们参观展览会时，都不禁以向秀丽的共产主义精神来对照一下自己。广州市公共汽车公司六十号青年车车长孙秋在参观了展览会以后，想起自己在党团组织的帮助下，生产上虽然有过一些成绩，当上了先进生产者；但是，他自己却有过不正确的想法：一心想如何提高自己的技术，对社会工作就不大起劲。参观了展览会以后，他激动地说：我决心要像向秀丽一样，做党的好儿女，永远听党的话，永远做一个大跃进的促进派和突击手。
    在向妈妈家里
    记者到向秀丽家里访问时，向秀丽的妈妈正在和一位上了年纪的女客亲昵地交谈着。起先，我猜想她们可能是亲戚，但是后来向妈妈告诉我说，她们只不过是老邻居。自从她的爱女向秀丽光荣地牺牲了以后，一些认识她的、或不认识她的人对她都照顾得无微不至。当她一个人在家里时，左邻右舍的人常常跑来伴着她，怕她感到寂寞。早些时候，一群特地从湖北省沙市到广州来参观向秀丽展览会的青年，在拜访她时都热情地认她做妈妈，还和她一起照相留念。向妈妈激动地说：现在到处有人叫我妈妈，我真是又感到光荣，又感到安慰。
    每天清早，向妈妈刚要拿起菜篮子上街去买菜时，市场上的售货员就把蔬菜送上门来了。她去买米，米店的工友说：“向妈妈，你回去吧！我给你送去好了。”少先队员们更是爱戴向妈妈，小北洪桥街小学的一群少先队员，一有空就跑来争着替向妈妈洗衣服、抹地板。
    千万个向秀丽在成长
    春节以前，珠江大桥工程局第五桥梁工程处发生过这样一桩事：学徒唐文魁是个初中学生，原来认为当装吊工“没出息”。这天，听到了向秀丽的英雄事迹，他痛心地说：“向秀丽把生命献给了社会主义建设事业，我这个初中生为什么不能做装吊工？”有一次，桥墩的钢板桩被潮水淹了，影响施工，他马上跳进寒冷的江水里去缚好钢板桩。学徒李祥炳，家里要他春节时回家，他说：“向秀丽是怎样对待工作的？我怎能放下生产回家呢？”这个工程处有的人原来专拣轻活做，学习了向秀丽的英雄事迹后，现在不但争着干重活，还利用业余时间和假日修道路、卸石料，加速运输工作，2月份全处超额完成了生产任务。
    现在，类似上述的事例正在各地不断的出现。这些事例说明：向秀丽虽然为国家牺牲了，但成千上万的向秀丽正在不断地成长。
