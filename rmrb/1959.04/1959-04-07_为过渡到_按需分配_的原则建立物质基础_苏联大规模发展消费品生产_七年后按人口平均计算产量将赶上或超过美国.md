Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch: According to Soviet press reports, the Soviet Union is now fully capable of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in the production of consumer goods per capita in the shortest possible time, and of establishing the necessary material basis for the transition to the communist principle of "distribution according to need." The Seven-Year Plan will be a huge step in achieving this grand goal. By the end of this plan in 1965, the total output of major consumer goods such as textiles, clothing, shoes, milk, dairy products, sugar, and animal fats in the Soviet Union, as well as the output and consumption per capita, will approach or exceed the current level of the United States; the production level of these products, as well as vegetables and vegetable oils, will then be able to fully meet the needs of the residents. At that time, the textiles produced by the country in one year will be enough to make about fifteen sets of clothing for each person on average; the leather shoes produced by the country will average more than two pairs per person.

During the Seven-Year Plan, the production of consumer goods in the Soviet Union will experience an unprecedentedly large-scale development. According to the plan, the Soviet state's investment in developing production departments serving residents in the next seven years will exceed the total investment in this area in the past forty years; the speed of basic construction in departments directly serving the needs of residents will be higher than the average speed of basic construction in the entire national economy. For example, during the period 1959-1965, the total investment in basic construction of the Soviet national economy will be more than 80% higher than in the past seven years, while investment in basic construction in agriculture, light industry, and the food industry will increase by 100% respectively. The increase in the production of consumer goods for the people is also considerable, with agricultural products increasing by 70% and industrial consumer goods increasing by 62%-65%. During the seven years, the absolute increase in the production of many important consumer goods, such as textiles, shoes, and sugar, will be greater than the absolute increase in the past twenty to forty years.

The Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union put forward a task, requiring that in the next seven years, on the basis of continuing to prioritize the development of heavy industry, more, more diverse, and high-quality food, sufficient textiles, clothing, shoes, and other commodities be produced for the residents. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that in the next seven years, the annual grain output should reach 10 billion to 11 billion poods, and the output of raw cotton, sugar beets, fruits, and various livestock products should increase by about one-third to one time respectively, so that the level of agricultural production can be developed to fully meet the needs of residents for food and the needs of industry for raw materials. In terms of the production of industrial consumer goods, according to the plan, the growth rate of consumer goods production in the Soviet Union will reach an average of 7.6% per year in the next seven years. In this way, by 1965, the output of leather shoes in the Soviet Union will increase by 160 million pairs compared with last year, reaching 515 million pairs; the total output of various textiles will increase from more than 7 billion meters last year to more than 10.5 billion meters, the output of knitted underwear and clothing will increase by two-thirds to one time, and the output of valuable daily necessities such as televisions, refrigerators, motorcycles, and washing machines will increase several times.

Such a rapid increase in consumer goods will further improve the consumption level of the Soviet people in the next seven years. During the Seven-Year Plan, the growth rate of the consumption level of the Soviet people will be almost equal to the total growth rate of the entire national economy's production. The various food products and industrial consumer goods obtained by the Soviet people will be almost two-thirds more than they are now. By 1965, the supply of major consumer goods for residents will be 40% to 100% more than they are now. The consumption of many foods will be higher than the consumption in the most developed capitalist countries. As for the consumption of textiles and clothing, it will also approach the average consumption of the American people. For example, by 1965, the consumer goods produced in the Soviet Union will average 450 to 500 kilograms of milk and dairy products, 41 to 44 kilograms of sugar, 20 kilograms of fish, 2.22 meters of wool fabrics, and 2.3 pairs of leather shoes per person. In the United States, in 1956, which once reached the highest post-war production level, the per capita consumption of milk and dairy products was only 334 kilograms, sugar - 43 kilograms, fish - 4.5 kilograms, the consumption of wool fabrics was only 1.9 meters, and the average consumption of leather shoes was 3.5 pairs.

    为过渡到“按需分配”的原则建立物质基础
    苏联大规模发展消费品生产
    七年后按人口平均计算产量将赶上或超过美国
    新华社5日讯　据苏联报刊报道：苏联现在已经完全有条件在最短的时期内，在按人口平均计算的消费品产量上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家，并且为过渡到“按需分配”的共产主义分配原则建立必要的物质基础。七年计划将是实现这一宏伟目标的巨大的一步。到1965年这个计划结束时，苏联的纺织品、服装、鞋、牛奶、奶制品、糖、动物油脂等重要消费品的总产量，按人口计算的产量和消费量将分别接近或超过美国目前的水平；以上这些产品以及蔬菜和植物油的生产水平那时将可以完全满足居民的需要。那时国家一年生产的纺织品可以平均为全国每人做约十五套服装；国家生产的皮鞋平均每人可以得到两双多。
    在七年计划期间，苏联消费品的生产将获得空前大规模的发展。根据计划，今后七年间苏联国家用于发展为居民服务的生产部门的投资将超过过去四十年用于这方面的全部投资额；直接为居民生活需要服务的部门的基本建设速度将高于整个国民经济基本建设的平均速度。例如，在1959—1965年期间，苏联国民经济基本建设投资总额比过去七年多80％，而农业、轻工业和食品工业的基本建设投资都将分别增加一倍。人民消费品生产增长额也是相当大的，其中，农产品将增加70％，工业消费品生产将增加62％—65％。七年期间，许多重要消费品如纺织品、鞋类、糖等的绝对增产量比过去二十年到四十年的绝对增产量还多。
    苏联共产党和政府提出一项任务，要求在今后七年内在继续优先发展重工业的基础上为居民生产出更多的、多种多样的、质量高的食品、足够的纺织品、服装、鞋和其他商品。七年计划规定，今后七年间要使谷物年产量达到一百亿至一百一十亿普特，原棉、甜菜、水果和各种畜产品的产量大约分别增加三分之一左右到一倍，以便使农业生产水平发展到能够充分满足居民对食品的需要和工业对原料的需要。在工业消费品生产方面，根据计划，今后七年苏联消费资料生产的增长速度平均每年将达到7.6％。这样，到1965年苏联的皮鞋产量将比去年增加一亿六千万双，达到五亿一千五百万双；各种纺织品的总产量将从去年的七十多亿公尺增加到一百零五亿公尺以上，针织内衣和服装产量将增加三分之二到一倍，电视机、冰箱、摩托车、洗衣机等贵重日用品将增加数倍。
    消费品如此迅速地增加，将使苏联人民的消费水平在今后七年进一步提高。七年计划期间，苏联人民消费水平的增长速度将几乎等于整个国民经济生产的总的增长速度，苏联人民得到的各种食品产品和工业消费品将差不多比现在多三分之二，到1965年，居民的主要消费品的供应量将比现在多40％至100％。有很多食品的消费量，将比最发达的资本主义国家里的消费量还高。至于织品和衣着的消费量，也将接近于美国人民的平均的消费量。例如，到1965年苏联生产的消费品中，平均每人可以得到四百五十至五百公斤牛奶和奶制品、四十一至四十四公斤砂糖、二十公斤鱼类、二点二二公尺毛织品和二点三双皮鞋，而在美国，在曾经达到战后最高生产水平的1956年，按人口平均计算的牛奶和奶制品的消费量只有三百三十四公斤，砂糖——四十三公斤，鱼类——四点五公斤，毛织品的消费量只有一点九公尺，而皮鞋的平均消费量则为三点五双。
