Clever Arrangement, More Output
By our reporter Hu Jian
By our Hunan Daily reporter Deng Xiuhai

A year only has three hundred and sixty-five days, but Zhang Shougon, the deputy captain of the Shitang Production Team of the Wushan People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan, did seven hundred and ten workdays in the past year. One person did the work of two, completing two years' worth of work quotas in one year. Zhang Shougon is a twenty-three-year-old Communist Party member and secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. In December of last year, he attended the representative meeting of advanced units in Hunan Province for agricultural socialist construction.

Where does the energy come from?

During this busy spring plowing season, we met Comrade Zhang Shougon in a mountain village on the banks of the Xiangjiang River. Initially, we imagined that this labor hero would be a tall, burly man. In fact, he is not tall, and even appears somewhat short. He looks like a diligent, intelligent, and simple farmer. He doesn't like to talk. We asked him several times how he managed to do the work of two people, and after a long time, he said, "Working is my own business, so it's right to do more." Li Baigui, the deputy secretary of the commune party committee, told us, "This kid doesn't say much, but he's always working quietly."

Before liberation, Zhang Shougon's father worked as a long-term hired laborer for a landlord. He was tired all year round, but he couldn't feed his family of five. His mother took him and his brothers to beg for food. At that time, Zhang Shougon was not even ten years old, but he would rather go to the mountains to find wild vegetables to eat than beg at the landlord's door. After liberation, his family's life got better day by day, moving from a thatched hut to a tile-roofed house. Zhang Shougon pointed to the dilapidated thatched hut and said to us, "Every day when I go to work, I see this dilapidated hut, think about the past, and look at today's life, and I feel full of energy."

Last spring, the agricultural cooperative set a leap forward plan for a thousand catties per mu. The biggest problem was the shortage of labor. The Party branch called on Party and League members to take the lead, promote the spirit of hard work and clever work, and launch a movement to "break through work quotas." Zhang Shougon took the lead in making a plan to do five thousand work points (ie, five hundred workdays) throughout the year. At the agricultural leap forward mobilization meeting held in the county, he announced his plan. His soaring enthusiasm set off a socialist emulation campaign of "learning from Zhang Shougon and catching up with Zhang Shougon" among cadres and commune members in Changsha County.

Clever Work

The news that Zhang Shougon would do five thousand work points in a year spread throughout the county. At that time, some farmers who lacked enthusiasm shook their heads. They said, "There are only three hundred days in a year. To do five hundred workdays, unless Nezha descends to earth or Guanyin is reborn." Upper-middle peasant Zhang Zhitang openly bet with him, "If Zhang Shougon does five hundred workdays, I will treat him to a sea cucumber banquet."

The Party teaches people that the key to improving work efficiency lies in reforming tools and scientifically arranging farm work. This teaching took root in Zhang Shougon's heart, and he was confident in completing his work plan. On April 25th last year, he created a miracle for the first time. That day was for removing fertilizer from the ponds, and others carried it on their shoulders. But he designed and manufactured a mud boat. This mud boat had a long handle, and the bottom plate was boat-shaped. Using the buoyancy of the water surface, it could be pushed or dragged across the field, carrying six or seven loads at a time, moving quickly, and making the person feel relaxed. On that day, Zhang Shougon removed fertilizer from the ponds and spread fertilizer over 8.9 cubic meters. According to the quota, removing fertilizer from the ponds at 1.7 cubic meters would earn ten work points, so 8.9 cubic meters was equivalent to fifty-two and a half work points. The work recorder almost couldn't believe his eyes, measuring it again and again, and carefully checking the quality. The fertilizer was spread evenly in both near and far ponds, the fertilizer was removed cleanly, and there were no problems with the quantity.

In the evening, commune members evaluated work and recorded points. The work recorder calculated with the abacus and announced to the commune members: "Today, Zhang Shougon removed fertilizer from the ponds at 8.9 cubic meters, and according to the quota, he is awarded fifty-two and a half work points." Many people found it strange, suspecting that such a high number was a mistake. Someone said, "The work recorder is protecting Zhang Shougon." Others said, "If there is this much, the quality of work must be poor." The argument continued late into the night without any results, so it was decided to re-examine the fields the next day. The next morning, many commune members came to check the fertilizer removed from the ponds by Zhang Shougon. The facts convinced everyone. Zhang Zhitang, who bet with Zhang Shougon, also admitted that he had lost. After that, more than one hundred and forty mud boats were promoted throughout the commune for sending fertilizer to the ponds, and work efficiency increased more than four times.

Clever Arrangement

Zhang Shougon and the youth shock brigade he led were also good at rationally using time and scientifically arranging farm work. This shock brigade used the spirit of "long-term planning and short-term arrangement." They tried to complete their daily tasks on the same day, strictly implemented contracting plans, and were diligent every day, diligent in everything, and diligent everywhere, not wasting time and not walking empty-handed. Every day when they went to work, they carried a load of fertilizer to the fields, and when they finished work, they carried a load of green fodder back to the house. Whether it was sunny or rainy, there was always something to do. Zhang Shougon's work manual records that last year he earned 1,353 work points for farm work such as replacing old wall soil and making soil fertilizer at home on rainy days. Last year, he used his spare time after work to cultivate sweet potatoes for the commune, achieving high yields, and therefore received more than seven hundred work points in overproduction rewards.

Secondly, while adopting the method of assembly line operation and division of labor and cooperation, they staggered farm work and cleverly combined heavy work with light work. For example, when removing fertilizer from the ponds, in the past, one person sent fertilizer and one person spread fertilizer, but now they are done by one person. The person pushing the mud boat to send fertilizer feels tired, so he spreads fertilizer for a while and rests. Zhang Shougon calls this clever combination: "Resting in labor, laboring in rest." This way, work efficiency is high and can be sustained.

Zhang Shougon also has an experience: observe things and do things, arrange work according to observation, do today's work, and think about tomorrow's work. For example, last winter when making large ponds in the fields, they considered that the old field corner ponds would be far away when removing fertilizer from the ponds next spring, wasting labor. He changed the round ponds in the field corners to long ponds, placed in the middle of the field, which was not only convenient for removing fertilizer from the ponds, but also allowed the use of cattle plows to turn the fertilizer, saving manpower. Later, the entire commune promoted this new pond-making method.

Last spring, more than thirty commune members transported fertilizer from the back mountain to the fields. There was a small harbor in the middle, and without a bridge, they had to detour one hundred and forty zhang before they could send the fertilizer to the fields. Many people had been transporting fertilizer like this for several days without realizing that this was a waste of labor. But as soon as Zhang Shougon participated in the fertilizer transportation, he quickly discovered this problem. He put down his shoulder pole, went up the mountain to cut down a few trees, and built a makeshift bridge. On this day, people's fertilizer transportation efficiency was 21% higher than the previous days. Last spring, the commune used a boat to transport more than one hundred and sixty loads of lime to the fields. The boat was docked on a small river four or five li away. In previous years, the lime was always transported from the river back to the commune, and when needed, it was transported from the commune to the cultivated area by the river, which cost a lot of labor every year. Zhang Shougon saw this as a loophole, so he proposed to store the lime at the homes of commune members near the river, and take it nearby when needed. Zhang Shougon was not only clever at arranging farm work himself, but also often patiently helped commune members rationally arrange their work. Zhang Zhengming, who was strong and energetic, was very enthusiastic, but he didn't plan well. Zhang Shougon patiently and specifically helped him rationally arrange his work. For example, Zhang Zhengming lived in the mountain valley and had a lot of fertilizer but the fields were far apart. Zhang Shougon told him to bring a load of fertilizer to the fields when he went to work in the morning and at noon. This way, Zhang Zhengming could do thirty more work points a month.

Continue to Advance

Zhang Shougon always requires himself to "do more today than yesterday, and do even better tomorrow," his heart is always moving forward, always thinking about how to do farm work more and better.

Now, this production team has straightened and widened the winding field roads. Eight shock team members have seven carts and have also prepared five rice transplanters. Zhang Shougon also uses his spare time to contract some of the commune's sweet potato planting and pig raising, further combining field labor and auxiliary labor.

Changsha County is enthusiastically carrying out the socialist emulation campaign of "learning from Zhang Shougon and catching up with Zhang Shougon." In Wushan Commune alone, tens of thousands of male and female commune members have proposed challenge conditions to Zhang Shougon, determined to surpass Zhang Shougon. And with the encouragement of the Party and the support of the masses, Zhang Shougon's enthusiasm is even greater. He expressed his determination to the Party that he must make greater contributions to socialism in this year's Great Leap Forward.

    巧安排  多出活
    本报记者　胡坚
    湖南日报记者　邓秀海
    一年只有三百六十五天，可是湖南长沙县乌山人民公社石塘生产队的副队长张守功，在去年一年中做了七百一十个劳动日。一个人干的活赛过两个人，一年完成了两年的工作定额。张守功是位二十三岁的共产党员、共青团支部书记。去年12月他出席了湖南省农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议。
      劲从何来？
    在这个春耕大忙的季节，我们在湘江之滨的一个山村里，会见了张守功同志。开始，我们想像这位劳动英雄准是个高个大汉。其实，他的身材并不高大，还显得有些矮小，一看就是一位勤劳、聪敏、朴实的农民。他不爱讲话。我们几次请他谈谈他怎样一个人干了两个人的活，他半晌才说：“干活是自己的事嘛，多做点也是应该的。”公社党委副书记李柏桂对我们说：“这孩子就是不讲半句多话，可老是不声不响地干活。”
    解放前，张守功的父亲给地主当长工，一年累到头，也养不活一家五口。他母亲带着他们兄弟讨饭吃。当时张守功还不到十岁，但是他宁愿自己上山寻野菜吃，也不肯上地主的门讨着吃。解放了，他家的生活一天好似一天，从茅棚子搬进了瓦屋。张守功指着那间烂茅棚对我们说：“我每天出工，看到这个烂棚子，想想过去，看看今天的生活，就浑身有劲了。”
    去年春天，农业社订出了亩产千斤的跃进规划，最大的问题是劳力不足。党支部号召党、团员带头，发扬苦干巧干的精神，开展
  “突破工作定额”的运动。张守功首先作出了全年要做五千个劳动工分（即五百个劳动日）的规划。他在县里召开的农业跃进动员大会上，说出了自己的规划。他的冲天干劲，在长沙县的干部和社员中掀起了一个“学张守功、赶张守功”的社会主义立功竞赛运动。
        巧干
    张守功一年要做五千个工分的消息在全县传开了。当时一些干劲不足的农民摇了头。他们说：“一年才三百多天，要做五百个劳动日，除非哪吒下凡、观音再世。”上中农张志堂公开和他打赌，“如果张守功做了五百个劳动日，就请他吃海参酒席。”
    党教导人们要提高工效的关键在于改革工具和科学地安排农活，这个教导在张守功心里生了根，他对完成自己的劳动规划胸有成竹。去年4月25日，他首次创造了奇迹。那一天是出凼粪，别人凭肩膀挑，他却设计制造了一种拖泥船。这种泥船，拖手很长，底板是个船形，利用水面的浮力，推着或拖着在田间滑行，一次可以装六、七担，跑得快，人又轻松。那一天，张守功共出凼粪和撒粪八点九方。按照定额出凼粪一点七方，就要记十分工，八点九方就折合五十二个半工分。记工员几乎有些不相信自己的眼睛，三番五次丈量，又细致地检查质量，远近凼粪都散得匀，粪也出得干净，数量更没有问题。
    晚上，社员们评工记分。记工员把算盘一打，向社员宣布：“今天张守功出凼粪八点九方，按定额评工分五十二分半。”不少人觉得奇怪，怀疑这样多是弄错了。有人说：“记工员包庇张守功。”也有人说：“有这样多，工夫质量一定不好。”争论到深夜没有个结果，决定第二天到田间复查。第二天清早，很多社员来检查张守功出的凼粪。事实说服了大家。和张守功打赌的张志堂也承认自己输了。之后，全社推广了一百四十多只泥船送凼粪，工效提高四倍多。
        巧安排
    张守功和他领导的青年突击队还善于合理利用时间、科学安排农活。这个突击队运用“长计划、短安排”的精神，每天的事尽量当天做完，严格执行包工计划，做到日日勤、事事勤、处处勤，时不空过，路不空行。他们每天出工，带一挑肥料下田，收工又带一担青饲料进屋。不管是晴天落雨，都有事情可做。在张守功的劳动手册上记载着：去年他利用雨天在家里换陈墙土、造土化肥等农活的工分就有一千三百五十三分。他去年利用收工后的工余时间，给社里培育红薯达到高产，因此得到超产奖励工分七百多个。
    其次，他们在采取流水作业、分工协作办法的同时，使农活交错进行，重活与轻活巧妙结合。比如，出凼粪，过去是一个人送粪，一个人撒粪，现在他们由一个人来干。推泥船送粪的人感到累了，就撒一阵粪，歇歇气。张守功把这种巧妙的结合叫做：“劳动中休息，休息中劳动。”这样工效高，又能持久。
    张守功还有一条经验是：看事做事，看活安排，做今天的事，想明天的活。比如，去年冬季作田间大凼，他们就考虑到过去的田角凼，来年开春出凼粪，运距远，浪费工。他就把田角圆凼改成长形凼，作在田中间，不仅出凼粪方便，而且翻凼粪可以改用牛犁耙，节省人力。后来，全社都推广了这种新的作凼方法。
    去年春天，三十多名社员从后山运肥下田，中间隔一条小港子，没有桥，要绕道一百四十丈，才能把肥料送下田去。许多人就这样运了几天肥料，都没有注意这是一件浪费劳动力的事情。但是张守功一参加运肥，很快发现了这个问题，他放下肩担，上山砍几株树，搭了一条便桥。这一天人们的运肥工效就比前几天提高21％。去年春天，社里用船运来一百六十多担石灰上田，船停在四、五里路外的小河边。往年总是把石灰从河边运回社里，需用时从社里又运到河边的耕作区，这样每年要花很多劳动力。张守功看出了这是一个漏洞，于是提议把石灰寄放在河边社员的家里，需用时就近取用。张守功不但自己巧于安排农活，而且经常耐心地帮助社员们合理安排活路。身强力壮的张正明，干劲很大，就是没有盘算，张守功耐心具体地帮助他合理安排活路。比如，张正明住在山冲里，肥料多，隔田远。张守功告诉他每天早上和中午出工时顺便带一担肥料下田。这样张正明一个月可多做三十分工。
      继续前进
    张守功总是要求自己“今天比昨天做得多，明天又比今天干得更好”，他的心总是向前进，总是想如何把农活做得更多更好。
  现在，这个生产队把弯弯曲曲的间田大道改直加宽了，八个突击队员有七部车子，还准备了五个插秧机。张守功还利用工余时间包种一部分社里的红薯和养猪，进一步把田间劳动和辅助劳动结合起来。
  长沙县正在热火朝天地开展
  “学张守功、赶张守功”的社会主义立功竞赛运动。单是乌山公社就有上万名男女社员向张守功提出了应战条件，决心要赛过张守功。而张守功在党的鼓舞和群众的支持下，干劲更大了。他向党表示决心，一定要在今年大跃进中，对社会主义作出更大的贡献。
