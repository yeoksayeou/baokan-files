　　Lhasa's Spring
　　Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Lhasa

　　The first spring thunder rumbled over Lhasa, the snow covering the surrounding mountains melted, the weeping willows in front of the Jokhang Temple sprouted new buds, and flocks of wild geese and cranes flew gracefully over the Lhasa plains. Spring has come to Lhasa.

　　In the early morning, farmers and herdsmen from the suburbs drove their donkeys into the city to sell cow dung and grain, groups of students carried their schoolbags to school, postmen rode bicycles to deliver the day's newspapers to subscribers, and vehicles moved constantly on the streets. This famous ancient city quickly returned to normal after the rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group was quelled.

　　In the office of the Military Control Commission, citizens came in an endless stream to discuss matters. Some people were introduced to jobs, while others came to register. The staff of the Military Control Commission went deep into the residents' courtyards to publicize the central government's policies and provide relief to citizens who had suffered in the rebellion. Poor citizens also received relief.

　　A New Page in Tibetan History

　　The golden roof of the office building of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in the Shol in front of the Potala Palace is bathed in golden sunlight. In the past few days, it has been particularly lively here. Cars, motorcycles, and bicycles have been coming and going on the road leading to the gate of the office building. In order to implement the State Council's order of March 28, Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, arrived in Lhasa from Xigaze on the afternoon of April 5, and on the 8th, he presided over the first plenary meeting of the committee to exercise the functions of the Tibetan local government.

　　That day was the busiest day for the Preparatory Committee. Early in the morning, as soon as the sunlight shone on the green treetops of the Shol, the committee members arrived one after another. At 3 p.m., Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni and Vice Chairmen Zhang Guohua, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and all the committee members seriously discussed and adopted the "Resolution of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region on Implementing the State Council's Order of March 28" and various resolutions on improving and strengthening the organizational structure of various departments of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. These resolutions, following the pacification of the Lhasa rebellion, wrote a new page in Tibetan history.

　　Before the rebellion, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group repeatedly attempted to undermine the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region. They threatened Tibetan cadres working in the Preparatory Committee, demanding that they "withdraw from the Preparatory Committee" and forbidding them from going to the Preparatory Committee office, otherwise they would be killed. After the outbreak of the armed rebellion, the rebels frantically strafed the office building of the Preparatory Committee with artillery fire and machine guns. However, before long, the former Tibetan local government had played with fire and burned itself, embarking on the road to destruction. The Preparatory Committee was not only not destroyed, but became more consolidated and united.

　　The committee members gathered together and spoke freely, and this happy mood and belief in a better future were also reflected in the vast number of monks and laypeople in Lhasa. On the afternoon of the 7th, when Panchen Erdeni went to the Jokhang Temple and Ramoche Temple to worship Buddha, thousands of Lhasa citizens gathered in the streets to pay homage to him. People supported him in presiding over the work of the Preparatory Committee during the Dalai Lama's abduction by traitors, and believed that he would surely unite all the people of Tibet and do many good things for the people of Tibet.

　　The upper-class reactionary group in Tibet and the imperialists slanderously accused the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army of "destroying religion" in Tibet. The scene at the Preparatory Committee meeting powerfully refuted this shameless slander. Among the original members of the Preparatory Committee and the newly appointed members, many were Living Buddhas and Khenpos in cassocks. Gdan Chiba, the successor of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, entered the office building of the Preparatory Committee as a member for the first time on the 8th. When the staff at the registration desk handed him five Tibetan-language proposals, the white-haired old Living Buddha was full of smiles and repeatedly clasped his hands in excitement. He took these documents to the lounge to read carefully, and while reading, he said to the committee members beside him: "I am so happy today!" The committee members who heard this nodded and smiled frequently. Gdan Chiba spoke at the meeting. Afterwards, he told reporters: "The Chinese Communist Party not only respects the freedom of religious belief in Tibet, but also gives religious figures political status. In the future, in addition to chanting scriptures, I will definitely do my best to do a good job in the Preparatory Committee."

　　The Central Government Cares for the Tibetan People

　　At a residents' group meeting held by a work team of the Lhasa Municipal Military Control Commission, a unemployed painter named Qiangba Zhaxi said excitedly after registering for employment: "The Central Government really cares for us Tibetan people."

　　He said that in the eight years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, everything that the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army have done in Tibet, such as running schools, establishing people's hospitals, and issuing interest-free loans, has been for the benefit of the Tibetan people. The former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group not only consistently drove the Tibetan people to serve them, but also created rebellions, adding endless pain and disaster to the Tibetan people. After the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, the Central People's Government provided timely relief to us and arranged jobs for the unemployed.

　　Qiangba Zhaxi's words expressed the true feelings of the Tibetan people. When people saw the happy smiles on the faces of the white-haired old people after receiving relief grain, and the greedy faces of the innocent vagrant children eating the tsampa they received, they could not help but be moved to tears. Five orphans begged from Dingqing to Lhasa, suffering from cold and hunger along the way. The hands and feet of four of them had been frozen into disabilities, and the smallest one was so ill that he was unrecognizable. After the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, these five orphans, like many others with the same fate, received relief.

　　A Joyful Garden

　　Crisp chimes rang out from the garden next to the Potala Palace from time to time, and thousands of Tibetan and Hui primary and secondary school students began their studies here again.

　　The Young Pioneers, who used to be often beaten by the rebels, are now the most active. They held high the Young Pioneer flag, sang the team song, and spent the team day in this beautiful place. Luo Sangqujie, a fourteen-year-old child, had his leg broken by several rebels not long ago for wearing a red scarf. Now he said happily: "The bad guys can't bully us anymore, and no one can stop us from wearing red scarves." Caiwang Quming, the first Young Pioneer in Tibet, was threatened by the rebels many times, who told him to tear off the red scarf around his neck and not to be a Young Pioneer. As soon as the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, he took the initiative to join the propaganda team and accuse the rebels of their crimes.

　　The garden, which was full of terror half a month ago, is now filled with noisy laughter everywhere. The students are enthusiastically discussing the State Council's order, and they all said that they must study new knowledge hard and prepare to contribute their strength to building a happy new Tibet. Around Barkhor Street

　　In Barkhor Street, the busiest area in Lhasa, the usual scene has now been restored: the leather shops exude the smell of smoked leather, and the sounds of hammering can be heard from the coppersmith and silversmith shops; various stalls are lined up one after another, and Tibetan scriptures and Tibetan novels are displayed on the book stalls. The shops that were once closed due to the rebellion launched by the rebels are now wide open, and various valuable commodities are displayed again. The national commodity store of the Tibet Trading Company is particularly crowded, with merchants negotiating wholesale tea here, and farmers and herdsmen selecting their favorite goods. In the vegetable market, women buying vegetables are bustling around. This year's spinach, Chinese cabbage, green onions, ginger, etc. were on the market earlier than in previous years, and the prices were also cheaper than in the past.

　　The daily turnover of many stores has increased compared to before the rebellion. Tibetan merchant Renqing Tudan told reporters: "Before the rebellion, the rebels obstructed and robbed pedestrians. Few farmers and herdsmen came to the city. Under the threat of the rebels, the shops did not dare to officially open. Now the farmers and herdsmen returning to their hometowns have no worries and can come and go freely, so the sales of tea, cloth, and daily necessities have increased."

　　As the rebellion was quelled, the phenomenon of high market prices caused by the rebels gathering in Lhasa quickly stabilized, and the prices of tea and butter remained the same.

　　Building a More Beautiful Lhasa

　　Lhasa seems busier than before. Large quantities of construction timber are continuously transported from the forest areas on both sides of the Sichuan-Kangding Highway, and red flags are flying again at the construction sites. The bridges in the western suburbs of Lhasa that were burned down by the rebels have been quickly repaired. The staff of the housing construction team of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration rebuilt the 27-meter-long Lhasa Liusha River Highway Bridge in just nine days. Tibetan workers Langjie Caiwang and Tudeng Nima, who volunteered to participate in the construction of this bridge, said: We must not only quickly heal the wounds, but also build our hometown better.

　　The staff of the Lhasa Post and Telecommunications Bureau have been particularly busy these days. Telegrams supporting the State Council's order, comforting the troops of the Tibet Military Region, and denouncing the rebels have poured in from all over the country and Tibet. Long queues lined up in the business hall, with people telling their relatives about the situation of the rebellion being quelled, and merchants busy contacting and ordering goods from other places. Buses to Yadong, Golmud and other places also send out mail on time. Line workers have quickly restored the urban telephone lines that were severely damaged by the rebels, and the lines to the suburbs have also been repaired.

　　When the rebels launched the rebellion, they destroyed the high-voltage power lines in the city, attempting to plunge Lhasa into darkness. After the rebellion was quelled, the staff of the Lhasa Power Plant unanimously proposed that Lhasa must be restored to light in the shortest possible time. They quickly sent electricity to the factory in the northern suburbs, allowing the factory's machines to continue to operate as usual. With the efforts of all Tibetan and Han workers, electricity has now been sent to many agencies under the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, the Tibet Military Region, and the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC. The Potala Palace, which was once plunged into darkness, has now been re-illuminated.

　　Sowing the Seeds of Happiness

　　In the spring of Lhasa, after the rebellion was quelled, people quickly carried out spring plowing and production.

　　The Lhasa "July 1st" Agricultural Experiment Station has launched a production sprint month campaign. They have doubled the original vegetable production target and are working day and night to rush to cultivate, fertilize, irrigate, and sow.

　　Liao Zerong and Chen Haihe, young tractor drivers from the Lhasa "August 1st" Farm of the Tibet Military Region, drove their tractors happily in the fields. They said happily: This year's spring plowing is different from previous years. This is the first sowing after the rebellion was quelled. We will win a great victory on the agricultural front.

　　The staff of the Lhasa Transportation Main Station of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration, who showed heroic and tenacious performance in the battle to quell the Lhasa rebellion, began spring tree planting only a few days after the rebellion was quelled, planting 1,500 trees in one day on March 29. Then they launched spring plowing and sowing. Various agencies and troops in Lhasa also participated in the labor of planting spring vegetables.

　　Trucks transporting fertilizer come and go on the road leading to the suburbs. In the fields in the suburbs, Tibetan farmers have also begun to plow the land and water it, preparing to sow seeds. In the beautiful spring of Lhasa, a brand-new scene is presented.

### 拉萨的春天

　　拉萨的春天
　　新华社驻拉萨记者
    拉萨响过了第一次春雷，复盖四周山上的积雪消融了，大昭寺门前的唐柳吐出新芽，成群的大雁和灰鹤在拉萨平原上空翩翩飞翔。春天来到了拉萨。
    清晨，郊区的农牧民赶着毛驴涌向市区来卖牛粪和粮食，三五成群的学生背着书包走向学校，邮递员骑着自行车把当天报纸送给订户，大街上车辆来往不断。这个著名的古城，在原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动的叛乱被平息以后，很快地恢复了正常秩序。
    在军事管制委员会的办公室里，前来接洽事情的市民络绎不绝，一些人被介绍就业了，另一些人又来登记。军管会的工作人员，深入到居民的院落，向他们宣传中央的政策，救济在叛乱中受害的市民，贫苦的市民也得到了救济。
　　西藏历史上新的一页
    耸立在布达拉宫前面雪策林卡中的西藏自治区筹备委员会办公大楼的金顶，沐浴在金色的阳光里。几天来，这里特别热闹，通往办公大楼门前的公路上，小汽车、摩托车、自行车来来往往，为了执行国务院3月28日的命令，自治区筹委会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼4月5日下午从日喀则来到拉萨，并在8日主持了筹委会行使西藏地方政府职权的第一次全体委员会议。
    这天是筹委会最繁忙的一天。清晨，阳光刚照上雪策林卡的绿树梢头，委员们就纷纷来到了这里。下午三时，代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼和副主任委员张国华、阿沛·阿旺晋美以及全体委员，认真讨论并通过了“西藏自治区筹备委员会关于贯彻执行国务院3月28日命令的决议”，以及关于健全和加强西藏自治区筹备委员会各部门组织机构等各项决议。这些决议，继平定拉萨叛乱之后，在西藏历史上又写下了新的一页。
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团在叛乱前，一再企图搞垮自治区筹委会。他们威胁参加筹委会工作的藏族干部，要他们“退出筹委会”，不准到筹委会办公，否则就要加以杀害。武装叛乱爆发后，叛匪们又用炮火和机枪向筹委会办公大楼疯狂扫射，然而为时不久，原西藏地方政府却已玩火自焚，走上了灭亡的道路。筹委会不但没有被摧毁，而且更加巩固，更加团结了。
    委员们欢聚一起，个个畅所欲言，这种愉快心情和对未来美好生活的信念，同样表现在拉萨市广大僧俗人民身上。7日下午，班禅额尔德尼前往大昭寺和小昭寺朝佛时，几千名拉萨市民聚集街头向他顶礼朝拜。人们拥护他在达赖喇嘛被叛国分子劫持期间来主持筹委会的工作，相信他一定能团结全西藏人民，为西藏人民做很多好事情。
    西藏上层反动集团和帝国主义诬蔑中国共产党和人民解放军在西藏“毁灭宗教”，筹委会会议上的情景有力地回击了这种无耻谰言。筹委会原有的委员和新任命的委员中，有不少是身披袈裟的活佛和堪布。黄教祖师宗喀巴的继承人噶丹赤巴，8日那天就是第一次以委员的身份走进筹委会的办公大楼的。当报到处的工作人员把五份藏文议案交给他的时候，这位白发苍苍的老活佛满面笑容，兴奋得连连拱手。他把这些文件带到休息室里仔细阅读，一面读，一面向身旁的委员们说：“今天我太愉快了！”听了这话的委员们都频频点头微笑。噶丹赤巴在大会上发了言，过后，他对记者说：“中国共产党不但尊重西藏的宗教信仰自由，而且还给了宗教界人士以政治地位。今后，我除了念经以外，一定尽自己的力量作好筹委会的工作。”
　　中央关怀着西藏人民
    在拉萨市军管会一个工作队召开的居民小组会上，一位名叫强巴扎西的失业画匠在登记就业以后，激动地说：“中央真关怀我们西藏人民。”
    他说，西藏和平解放八年来，中央人民政府和人民解放军在西藏所作的事情，如办学校、成立人民医院、发放无息贷款等等，没有一件不是为了西藏人民的。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，不但一贯驱使西藏人民为他们服役，还制造叛乱，给西藏人民增添无限痛苦和灾难。拉萨叛乱平息以后，中央人民政府及时救济了我们，还给失业的人安排了工作。
    强巴扎西的这段话表达了西藏人民的真正感情。当人们看到白发苍苍的老人领到救济粮后流露出愉快的笑容，看到稚气十足的流浪孩子贪馋地吃着领到的糌粑时，都不禁感动得流泪了。有五个孤儿从丁青讨饭到拉萨，一路上受冻挨饿，其中四个人的手脚已冻成残废，最小的一个已病得不成人形。这五个孤儿，在拉萨叛乱平息以后，和许多有着同样命运的人一样，都得到了救济。
　　欢腾的园林
    布达拉宫旁边的园林里，不时传出清脆的钟声，上千名藏、回族中小学生又在这里开始了学习生活。
    过去经常遭到叛匪殴打的少先队员们，现在是最活跃的了。他们高举着少先队旗，唱着队歌，到这风景优美的地方欢度队日。十四岁的孩子罗桑曲杰，不久前因为佩带红领巾，被几个叛匪打坏了腿，现在他高兴地说：“坏蛋们再也不能欺侮我们了，谁也不能阻止我们佩带红领巾了。”西藏的第一名少先队员才旺曲明，叛匪多次威胁他，要他扯掉脖子上的红领巾，不许他当少先队员。拉藏叛乱一平息，他就主动参加了宣传队，控诉叛匪的罪行。
    半个月前还充满恐怖的园林里，现在到处洋溢着喧闹的笑声。学生们在热烈地讨论着国务院的命令，他们都表示，一定努力学习新的知识，准备为建设幸福的新西藏贡献自己的力量。在八角街周围
    在拉萨市区最热闹的八角街，现在恢复了平时的景象：皮制店里发散出熏制皮革的气味，铜匠和银匠铺内传出了敲打声；各种摊贩一个挨一个排列着，书摊上摆着藏经和藏文小说。曾因叛匪发动叛乱而一度掩着门的商店，现在门窗大开，各种贵重的商品又都陈设出来。西藏贸易公司民族商品门市部特别拥挤，商人们在这里接洽批发茶叶，农牧民们挑选喜爱的商品。菜市场上，购买蔬菜的妇女熙熙攘攘。今年的菠菜、小白菜和葱、姜等，比往年上市得早，而且价格也比过去便宜。
    许多商店每天的营业额比叛乱前增多了。藏族商人仁青土丹向记者说：“叛乱以前，叛匪阻挠和抢劫行人，农牧民来市区的很少，商店在叛匪的威胁下也不敢正式营业。现在回乡的农牧民们没有顾虑了，可以自由来往，所以茶、布和生活日用品的销售量有了增加。”
    随着叛乱被平息，曾因叛匪聚集拉萨而造成的市场物价高涨的现象，已迅速稳定下来，茶和酥油保持着原来价格。
　　把拉萨建设得更美丽
    拉萨比过去显得更繁忙了。大批的建筑木材，从川康公路两旁的林区源源运来，建筑工地上又飘起了红旗。拉萨西郊被叛匪烧毁的桥梁，已经很快修复。青藏公路管理局房建队的职工，只用九天时间，就把全长二十七公尺的拉萨流沙河公路桥重新建成。自愿前来参加修筑这座桥的藏族工人朗杰才旺和土登尼玛说：我们不但要很快地治好创伤，而且要把家乡建设得更好。
    拉萨邮电局的职工，这些天来特别繁忙。拥护国务院命令、慰问西藏军区部队和声讨叛乱分子的电文，从全国和西藏各地纷纷传来。营业室内排着长长的行列，人们把平息叛乱的情况告诉亲人，商人们忙着向外地联络订货。开往亚东、格尔穆等地的班车，也定时把邮件送出。线路工人们已使惨遭叛匪破坏的市内电话线很快恢复，目前通往郊区的线路也修复了。
    叛匪在发动叛乱时，破坏了市区的高压电线，企图使拉萨陷于黑暗中。叛乱平息后，拉萨电厂的职工一致提出，一定在最短时间内使拉萨重放光明。他们很快地把电流送到了北郊工厂，使这个厂的机器照常转动起来。在全体藏、汉族工人的努力下，现在电流已送到自治区筹备委员会、西藏军区和中共西藏工委所属的许多机关，一度陷入黑暗的布达拉宫，现在也重新放出了光明。
　　播下幸福种子
    拉萨的春天，在叛乱平息后，人们迅速地进行着春耕生产。
    拉萨“七一”农业试验场已经掀起了一个生产突击月运动。他们把原订的蔬菜生产指标提高了一倍，正在昼夜突击耕耘、施肥、灌溉和播种。
    西藏军区拉萨“八一”农场的年轻拖拉机手廖泽荣和陈海和驾驶着拖拉机，在田野上欢乐地奔驶，他俩兴高采烈地说：今年的春耕不比往年，这是叛乱平息后第一次播种，我们要在农业战线上打一个大胜仗。
    在平息拉萨叛乱战斗中表现英勇顽强的青藏公路管理局拉藏运输总站的职工们，在叛乱平息后不几天，就开始了春季植树，3月29日一天中就种植了一千五百株树。接着他们又展开了春耕春播。拉萨的各机关、部队，也都参加了种植春季蔬菜的劳动。
    通往市郊的公路上，来往着运送肥料的汽车。市郊的田野上，藏族农民们也开始了翻地浇水，准备播种。在拉萨美好的春天里，呈现出一片崭新的景象。
