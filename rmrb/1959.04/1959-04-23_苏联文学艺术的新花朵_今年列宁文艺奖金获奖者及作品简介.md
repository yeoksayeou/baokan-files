New Blossoms of Soviet Literature and Art
Introduction to the Winners and Works of This Year's Lenin Literary Prize

The Soviet Lenin Literary and Art Prize Committee has announced the winners of the 1959 awards. The winners include:

The Path of Abai

The winning work of Kazakh writer Auezov is "The Path of Abai." Through the image of Abai (1845-1904), a famous Kazakh singer, the enlightener and founder of Kazakh literature, and his friends, the author expresses the progressive forces of the Kazakh people and their pursuit of spiritual and personal freedom.

Poem of the Sea

Film director Dovzhenko (1894-1956) was world-renowned for directing films such as "Arsenal," "Earth," "Shchors," and "Michurin." His genius was further developed in his last work, "Poem of the Sea." The award-winning work "Poem of the Sea" is a film narrative poem describing the huge project of building an artificial reservoir, praising the Soviet people engaged in creative labor, and narrating their encounters, efforts, and ideals. Dovzhenko did not have time to personally direct the completion of this film before he passed away. The directing work of the film was continued by his wife, film director Solntseva.

Mayakovsky Monument

Kibalnikov's winning work is the Mayakovsky Monument. When creating this monument, he portrayed the poet as an agitator, reciting his passionate, combative poems towards a spacious square. This monument is simple in image, full of emotion, and demonstrates a high degree of sculpting skill.

Third Pathetique

The first part of Pogodin's award-winning trilogy, "The Man with a Gun," was written twenty years ago and was the first attempt to create an image of the great revolutionary leader Lenin in the field of drama. The other two parts, "The Kremlin Chimes" and "Third Pathetique" (this work won this year's Lenin Prize), describe Lenin's life from the October Revolution to his death. In these works, Pogodin expresses the flesh-and-blood connection between the revolutionary leader and the people, creating Lenin's character in all aspects as a great thinker, leader, and politician.

Smirnov

Stage actor Smirnov won the prize for his successful portrayal of Lenin in the stage play "Third Pathetique" performed at the Moscow Art Theatre.

Shtraukh

Film actor Shtraukh won the prize for his successful portrayal of Lenin in the film Lenin's Story.

Spartacus

Khachaturian's ballet "Spartacus" is a story about the slave uprising in ancient Rome, first performed in Leningrad in 1955. The music of the ballet fully expresses the composer's most prominent features in his creations - the beauty of musical language, the richness of melody, the unique orchestration, and the profound character descriptions.

Solovyov-Sedoy

Award-winning musician Solovyov-Sedoy is good at composing songs. His creations are closely linked to the traditions of Russian folk songs. His songs, with their national style, lively and powerful melodies, and original melodies and harmonies, are widely circulated among the masses. He won the prize for composing songs such as "Moscow Nights." (Photo attached)

    苏联文学艺术的新花朵
    今年列宁文艺奖金获奖者及作品简介
    苏联列宁文学艺术奖金委员会颁发了1959年度奖金。得奖的有：
    阿巴伊的道路
    哈萨克作家奥耶佐夫的得奖作品是“阿巴伊的道路”。作者通过哈萨克著名的歌手，哈萨克文学启蒙者和奠基人、诗人阿巴伊（1845—1904）和他的友人们的形象，表现了哈萨克人民的进步力量以及他们对精神的和人身的自由的追求。
    海之歌
    电影导演多夫仁科（1894—1956）曾以编导“兵工厂”、“大地”、“绍尔斯”、“米丘林”等影片而闻名世界。他的天才在他最后一个作品“海之歌”中得到了更大的发挥。得奖作品“海之歌”是描述修建人工水库的巨大工程、歌颂进行创造性劳动的苏维埃人、叙述他们的遭遇、努力和理想的一首电影叙事诗。多夫仁科没有来得及亲自导完这部影片就逝世了。影片的导演工作由他的夫人、电影导演索尔采娃继续完成。
    马雅可夫斯基纪念像
    基巴尔尼科夫获奖的作品是马雅可夫斯基纪念像。他在创作这座纪念像的时候，把诗人塑造成一个鼓动者，正在向着宽敞的广场朗诵自己的充满激情的、战斗的诗篇。这座纪念像形象朴质，充满感情，表现了高度的雕塑技巧。
    第三首热情的颂歌
    波戈金的得奖作品三部曲中，第一部“带枪的人”写成于二十年前，这是在戏剧领域中塑造伟大革命领袖列宁的第一次尝试。另外两部“克里姆林宫的钟声”和“第三首热情的颂歌”（这部作品获今年列宁奖金）描写了列宁从十月革命到逝世前的生活。波戈金在这些作品中表现了革命领袖和人民的血肉联系，创造了列宁作为一个伟大思想家、领袖、政治家的各方面的性格。
    斯米尔诺夫
    话剧演员斯米尔诺夫由于在莫斯科艺术剧院演出的舞台剧“第三首热情的颂歌”中扮演列宁成功而获得奖金。
    什特劳赫
    电影演员什特劳赫由于在影片列宁的故事中扮演列宁成功而获奖金。
    斯巴塔克
    哈恰图梁作曲的芭蕾舞剧“斯巴塔克”是描写古代罗马奴隶起义的故事，1955年第一次在列宁格勒演出。舞剧的音乐充分地表现了作曲家创作中最突出的特色——音乐词藻的华美、曲调的丰富、独到的配器法和深刻的性格描写。
    索洛符耶夫—谢多伊
    获奖音乐家索洛符耶夫—谢多伊擅长于创作歌曲，他的创作紧密地和俄罗斯民歌的传统联系在一起。他的具有民族风格、以活泼有力的曲调和独创的旋律与和声见长的歌曲，在群众中流传很广。他由于创作了“莫斯科郊外的黄昏”等歌曲而获奖金。（附图片）
