Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 27th: Facts revealed in documents seized by our army from Gönlung Monastery (one of Tibet's famous monasteries, and formerly the headquarters of the rebels) during the suppression of the rebellion prove that the Dalai Lama opposed the rebellion, and that he was kidnapped and surrounded by the rebel forces during the rebellion, and lost his freedom of movement.

One of the seized documents is the "Opinion Letter of the Nangma Khenchung Khenchung" (Nangma means the Dalai Lama's attendant, Khenchung is a fourth-rank monk official, and Khenchung is a fourth-rank secular official. "Nangma Khenchung Khenchung" refers to the fourth-rank officials who manage affairs around the Dalai Lama). The document is not dated, but the content suggests it was written on March 11th. The document reveals that the Dalai Lama was angry because reactionary elements incited monks and laypeople to prevent him from going out (to the military district auditorium to see a play). This corresponds to what the Dalai Lama said in his first letter to General Tan Guansan on March 11th: "Yesterday I decided to go to the military district to see a play, but due to the incitement of a few bad people, the monks and laypeople, not understanding the truth, followed and obstructed me, making it impossible for me to visit, causing me to feel ashamed, anxious, and at a loss." And, "Reactionary bad elements are using the excuse of protecting my safety to carry out activities that harm me. I am trying to quell this." The document also reveals that reactionary elements, against the Dalai Lama's wishes, insisted on holding a meeting in the Norbulingka, saying that moving the venue elsewhere would be "more harmful than beneficial," attempting to create the impression that the Dalai Lama was standing with the reactionary elements, thereby harming the Dalai Lama. The document also reveals that reactionary elements deployed a large number of armed personnel around the Dalai Lama to place him under house arrest, and other situations.

Another reactionary document seized from Gönlung Monastery, the "Opinion Letter of the Three Major Monasteries" (the Three Major Monasteries being Drepung, Sera, and Ganden, which were formerly the main nests of the rebels), reveals the plot of the reactionary elements and the former Tibetan local government (i.e., the Kashag) to kidnap the Dalai Lama, prevent him from moving freely, and the conspiracy to oppose national regional autonomy and attempt to achieve "independence." The full text of the "Opinion Letter of the Nangma Khenchung Khenchung" seized from Gönlung Monastery is as follows:

"Joint Opinion of the Commoner Nangma Khenchung Khenchung:

Yesterday, the Tibetan monks and laypeople and others prevented the Dalai Lama from going out. Although the Dalai Lama was angry, in fact, everyone was acting for the sake of the political and religious entity, and had no intention of opposing. As it is said: For the sake of all beings, one cannot make the Buddha suffer. Therefore, please immediately present offerings and report this to express gratitude. Holding a meeting in the Norbulingka will raise suspicions about the Dalai Lama's reputation. Moving the venue to another place will be more harmful than beneficial, so the meeting can still be held at the original location. [Note: According to the prisoners' confessions, on March 10th, the rebels surrounded the Norbulingka to prevent the Dalai Lama from going to the military district auditorium to see a play, and under the direction of Kashag officials Khenchung (Khenchung means Grand Secretary, also known as Chung-yik Chhen-po) Lama Ronglangse Thupten Norbu Sangpo, and Tsepön (officials in the Kashag in charge of personnel and finance) Kheme Tseten Wangchuk, a so-called "People's Representative Conference" controlled by the rebels was held in the Norbulingka. After the meeting announced Tibet's "independence," the Dalai Lama was very angry and instructed that no more meetings be held in the Norbulingka. At this time, some people advocated moving the meeting place to another location, but the rebel elements who wrote this opinion letter completely disregarded the Dalai Lama's words and insisted on holding the meeting in the Norbulingka.] Being responsible for the Dalai Lama's safety is the responsibility of the Gusong troops (Note: i.e., the generation responsible for guarding the Dalai Lama) and those added last night. More organizations must be added in the future, otherwise, they will not be able to bear the responsibility.

In addition to the original leaders, Gongdelin Tratsang (Note: this person is the commander-in-chief of the rebel army, and has fled to India), Khenchung Gesang Awang (rebel element, fourth-rank monk official, captured), and Pai Gorenshi Shakabpa (Note: i.e., rebel element Shakabpa Lobsang Dondrub, captured, he is the younger brother of Tsepön Shakabpa Wangchuk Deden, one of the Tibetan rebel leaders who fled to Kalimpong in 1951. Pai Go is a title of office, in charge of palanquins; Renxi is a fourth-rank official rank), Lhading Tense (i.e., rebel element Lhading Tense Sonam Bangjor, captured, Lhading is a title of office, meaning in charge of general affairs, fourth-rank official) should be added to assist. The Nechung Oracle (Note: a spirit who divines) indicates that scriptures should be chanted, and in order to quell matters that hinder the Dalai Lama's safety, all lamas and deities should divine and quickly complete extensive chanting. The future direction is that the history of Tibet's race, religion, language, and writing, etc., must be made undoubtedly suitable for an independent country, and the Tibetan people should act in accordance with the political and religious history that has been repeatedly clarified."

Among the twenty-two people who signed the "Opinion Letter of the Nangma Khenchung Khenchung," many are leaders of the rebel group, including Phala Thubten Woede, Renxi Shakabpa, Khenchung Gesang Awang, and Maji Assistant (Assistant to the Commander-in-Chief of the Tibetan Army) Khenchung Lodro Gesang, etc.

The full text of the "Opinion Letter of the Three Major Monasteries" is as follows:

"Opinion Letter of the Three Major Monasteries

The unanimous opinion of Drepung, Sera, and Ganden Monasteries: The Tibetan people request the Dalai Lama not to leave the palace, not to attend banquets or watch plays hosted by the central government. This matter will be guaranteed by the Kashag and Gukya Gekyo Kempo (Note: refers to the rebel element Gachang Lobsang Rigzin, 'Gukya' means 'close attendant,' 'Gukya Gekyo Kempo' is the title of a senior monk official attending the Dalai Lama) and should remain unchanged. It should be clearly stated to the Dalai Lama again that the joint Sino-Tibetan conference headed by the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region is also unnecessary, and we should manage our own affairs. When Tibet becomes independent, in order to ensure the life and prosperity of the Dalai Lama, reliable monk and lay officials, representatives of the Three Major Monasteries, and representatives of the army and the people should be quickly elected to hold regular meetings to seriously discuss matters. The meeting place can be located near the palace, or at the Jokhang Temple or other suitable places. Please consider."

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 27th: During the suppression of the rebellion, two draft copies of secret telegrams sent by the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet to Shakabpa, a Tibetan reactionary element in Kalimpong, were seized from Gönlung Monastery (one of the famous monasteries in Tibet), the location of the Tibetan rebel headquarters. This fact once again irrefutably proves that Kalimpong is the command center for Tibetan rebels. The telegrams also reveal that upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet want the Indian government to openly intervene.

The dates of these two telegram drafts are the 7th and 8th days of the second month of the Tibetan calendar, i.e., March 16th and 17th in the Gregorian calendar. The recipient of the telegrams, Shakabpa (i.e., Tsepön Shakabpa Wangchuk Deden), is one of the leaders of the Tibetan rebels who fled from Lhasa to Kalimpong in 1951 and has been colluding with imperialists and Indian expansionist elements to betray the motherland. The "Tibetan Welfare Association" is a counter-revolutionary organization established by the rebels in Kalimpong, specializing in carrying out subversive and separatist activities against the motherland in India. Shakabpa is one of the leaders of this counter-revolutionary organization.

The full text of the March 16th telegram is as follows:

"Kalimpong Shakabpa, forwarded to the entire Tibetan Welfare Association:

On the 1st day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar (Note: i.e., March 10th in the Gregorian calendar, which is the day the rebellion was launched), the independent nation of Tibet was established. Please announce this to everyone. And please be at Gangtok (Note: This is the capital of Sikkim) on March 18th in the Gregorian calendar to receive a phone call.

By the Tibetan Independence Conference
2nd month 7th day Tibetan calendar
This telegram was sent by Tsi-chak Khenchung"

The Tsi-chak Khenchung at the end of this telegram is one of the rebel leaders, Thupten Lhemön.

The full text of the March 17th telegram is as follows:

"Kalimpong Shakabpa Tsepön (Note: Tsepön is an official in the Kashag in charge of personnel and finance), to be forwarded to the Tibetan Welfare Association in India:

On the 1st day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar, the entire Tibetan people, high and low, monks and laypeople, are of one mind and have announced the establishment of an independent country, rising up from the tyrannical rule of the Han Chinese Red Communist Party. You should also publicize this matter in your area. The Han government is preparing a large-scale suppression in the Lhasa area. In order to avoid being swallowed up, please report to neighboring India, the Buddhist Conference, and the United Nations, and immediately send representatives to this place to observe the real situation. And please find a way to telegraph the Indian representative stationed in Lhasa to understand the situation in advance. In short, please use whatever method you think is best to seek support, and work hard with your past familiarity with the situation. And please inform us of the internal situation.

By the entire General Assembly of the People's Congress of the Independent Country of Tibet
2nd month 8th day Tibetan calendar"

    我军从西藏叛匪司令部缴获的文件再次证实
    达赖喇嘛确被叛匪劫持包围
    叛匪通过噶伦堡同印度扩张主义者建立联系
    新华社拉萨27日电　在平息叛乱中，我军从功德林（西藏著名的寺院之一，曾经是叛匪司令部所在地）缴获了一些文件，这些文件中所透露的事实，证明达赖喇嘛是反对叛乱活动的，他在叛乱过程中遭到叛乱分子的劫持和包围，失去了行动的自由。
    缴获的文件之一是“囊玛堪钦堪穷的意见书”（囊玛意为达赖喇嘛的侍从，堪钦是大四品僧官，堪穷为四品僧俗官员。“囊玛堪钦堪穷”是指达赖喇嘛身边管事务的四品官员）。这个文件没有注明时间，但从内容看来是3月11日写的。文件中透露达赖喇嘛因为反动分子煽动僧俗人民阻挡他出行（到军区礼堂看戏）而发怒，这和达赖喇嘛3月11日致谭冠三将军的第一封信中所说“昨天我决定去军区看戏，但由于少数坏人的煽动，而僧俗人民不解真象追随其后，进行阻拦，确实无法去访，使我害羞难言，忧虑交加，而处于莫知所措的境地”以及“反动的坏分子们正在借口保护我的安全而进行着危害我的活动。对此我正设法平息”的情况是符合的。这个文件还透露反动分子违背达赖喇嘛的意愿，坚持在罗布林卡开会，说会场迁往其他地方“有弊无利”，企图在外界造成达赖喇嘛和反动分子站在一起的印象，以此来危害达赖喇嘛。这个文件中还透露了反动分子在达赖喇嘛周围布置大量武装人员来软禁达赖喇嘛等情况。
    在功德林缴获的另一份反动文件“三大寺的意见书”（三大寺即哲蚌、色拉、噶丹寺，曾经是叛匪的主要巢穴）中，透露了反动分子和原西藏地方政府（即噶厦）劫持达赖喇嘛、不准达赖喇嘛自由行动的情况以及反对民族区域自治、妄图“独立”的阴谋。在功德林缴获的“囊玛堪钦堪穷的意见书”的全文如下：
    “庶民囊玛堪钦堪穷共同的意见：
    昨日西藏僧俗人民等阻挡达赖喇嘛出行，虽然达赖发怒了，其实大家是为了政教御体，并无反对的心意，正如：为了众生之故，不能使佛受累。因此请立即送上供奉，并且报告，对此表示谢意。在罗布林卡开会，会引起对达赖喇嘛名声的怀疑，会场要迁往其他地方之事，此举有弊无利，故仍可在原地开会〔按：据俘虏口供，3月10日叛匪包围罗布林卡阻止达赖喇嘛前往军区礼堂看戏，并在噶厦官员堪仲（堪仲即大秘书，亦称仲译清波）大喇嘛绒朗色·土登诺桑、孜本（噶厦中管理人事和财政的官员）凯墨·才汪顿珠的主持下，在罗布林卡内召开了由叛匪控制的所谓“人民代表会议”，会议宣布西藏“独立”以后，达赖喇嘛很生气，他指示不许再在罗布林卡开会。此时有人主张把开会地点迁往其他地方，但写这个意见书的叛乱分子根本不听达赖喇嘛的话，坚持在罗布林卡开会。〕。负责达赖御体问题，是古松部队（按：即负责警卫达赖的一代本）与昨晚增加部分，以后还一定要增加组织，否则担负不起任务。
    领导人员除原有的外，还应增加功德林扎萨（按：此人为叛军总司令，已逃往印度），堪穷格桑阿旺（叛乱分子，四品僧官，已俘），派郭仁希夏格巴（按：即叛乱分子夏格巴·洛桑顿珠，已俘，他是1951年逃到噶伦堡去的西藏叛匪头子之一孜本夏格巴·汪秋德敦之弟。派郭为职务名，管轿；仁希是四品官品），拉恰拉丁色（即叛乱分子拉丁色·索朗班觉，已俘，拉恰是职务名称，管理总务的意思，四品官）等以帮助。乃穷神（按为卜卦的神）指示精神念经，并且为了平息有碍达赖御体之事，还要各喇嘛神仙打卦，迅速完成广泛念经事。今后的方向，西藏的种族、宗教、语言文字等各方面历史均一定要使其无疑问的适于独立国家，西藏人民公众均按照政教历史多次所阐明的去作。”
    在“囊玛堪钦堪穷的意见书”上签名的二十二人中，有很多是叛乱集团的头子，其中包括帕拉·土登为登，仁希夏格巴，堪穷格桑阿旺，马基助理（藏军总司令助理）堪穷洛卓格桑等。
    “三大寺的意见书”的全文如下：
    “三大寺的意见书
    哲蚌、色拉、噶丹寺的一致意见：西藏人民都请求达赖喇嘛，今后不离开宫殿左右，不赴中央的宴会及观剧，此事由噶厦及古加基巧堪布（按系指叛乱分子噶章·洛桑日增，‘古加’是‘近侍’的意思，‘古加基巧堪布’为达赖喇嘛高级侍从僧官的名称）答应负责，应遵守不变。并要再次向达赖陈述清楚，同时今后以自治区筹委会为首的汉藏联合会议亦不需要，我们自己管理自己的事。西藏实行独立时，为了达赖的生命及事业的繁荣，要迅速选举可靠的僧俗官员代表，三大寺代表，军队、人民代表经常开会，认真商讨，会址除设在宫殿附近外，设在大昭寺或其他合适的地方亦可。请研究。”
    新华社拉萨27日电　在平息叛乱中从西藏叛匪司令部所在地功德林（西藏著名寺庙之一）缴获了西藏上层反动集团发给噶伦堡的西藏反动分子夏格巴的两封密电的底稿。这一事实再一次无可辩驳地证明了噶伦堡是西藏叛乱分子的指挥中心。密电还透露了西藏上层反动分子要印度政府公开进行干涉的情况。
    这两封密电底稿的日期是藏历2月7日和8日，即公历3月16日和17日。收电人夏格巴（即孜本夏格巴·汪秋德敦）是西藏叛匪首脑之一，1951年从拉萨逃到噶伦堡，一直在那里勾结帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子进行背叛祖国的活动。“西藏幸福事业会”是叛乱分子设在噶伦堡的反革命组织，专门在印度进行颠复和分裂祖国的活动。夏格巴是这个反革命组织的领导人之一。
    三月十六日密电的全文如下：
    “噶伦堡夏格巴转西藏幸福事业会全体：
    藏历2月1日（按：即公历3月10日，也就是发动叛乱的当天）西藏独立国已经成立，请向大家宣布。并请于公历3月18日至甘托克（按：这是锡金的首都）听电话。
                            西藏独立会议上
                              藏历2月7日
    此电由仔恰堪穷发送”
    这份密电最后的仔恰堪穷即叛匪首脑之一土登列门。
    三月十七日密电的全文如下：
    “噶伦堡夏格巴孜本（按：孜本是噶厦中管人事和财政的官员）转交驻印度藏族幸福事业会：
    近于藏历2月1日，藏族尊卑僧俗全体心意一致，已经宣布了自汉人红色共产党的强权之下起而成立独立国家，在你那个地方亦应宣传此事。汉政府已在拉萨周围地区准备大规模镇压，似此为免以大吃小，请向邻国印度政府、佛教会议、联合国报告，立即派代表来此地观察真实情况，并请设法电印度驻拉萨代表应于事先了解情况等。总之，用什么方法谋求支持为好，请本过去熟悉情况的精神，努力进行。并赐告内情。
                        西藏独立国人民会议全体大会
                                                藏历2月8日”
