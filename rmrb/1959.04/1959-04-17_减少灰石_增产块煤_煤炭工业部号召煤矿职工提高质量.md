Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 16th: The Ministry of Coal Industry recently convened a National Key Coal Mine Coal Quality Conference in Kailuan Coal Mine. The conference focused on the central issue of vigorously improving coal quality, extensively exchanged experiences, and formulated specific measures to improve coal quality. The conference called on coal mine workers across the country to work hard and cleverly for thirty days to reduce coal ash and stone content (reduce ash and gangue content in coal by 1%), and to increase lump coal production significantly.

The conference pointed out that since the National Coal Mine Red Banner Competition Radio Conference in early March, the large-scale bumper harvest red banner competition movement has been universally launched in coal mines across the country and has achieved great results. Thanks to the efforts of all employees to find tricks and make suggestions, and to vigorously carry out technological revolution to break through the weak links in production technology, coal production has soared, exceeding the first quarter coal production plan by 1.86 million tons, and the first production upsurge has emerged.

The conference believes that with the in-depth development of the large-scale bumper harvest movement, while vigorously increasing production, coal mine workers must also better improve the quality of coal. Because the quality of coal directly affects the output and quality of steel and other industrial products. If the ash content of refined coal is reduced by 1%, the coke consumption of the blast furnace can be reduced by 2.86%. Moreover, reducing the ash and sulfur content of coal can also save a lot of transportation tools and transportation costs.

The conference believes that the quality of coal is largely determined by the mining method. Therefore, when mining coal seams with false roofs and gangue, vigorously promoting the advanced experience of separate mining and separate transportation, and making gangue not or less exiting the well, is the best way to improve coal quality. At the same time, the establishment and improvement of coal quality management institutions and inspection systems is also very important for improving coal quality. Therefore, all coal mines should mobilize the masses to establish a mass coal quality inspection network. Each production team should set up two or three people to serve as coal quality inspectors concurrently, responsible for leading the team's coal quality inspection work.

At the meeting, representatives from various regions also exchanged the advanced experiences of Kailuan, Fengfeng and other coal mines in mobilizing the masses to improve coal quality. Among them, the advanced experience of Kailuan Coal Mine in relying on the masses to improve coal quality was particularly well received by representatives from various regions. This mine improved the ash and sulfur content in the first quarter of this year by 0.27% lower than the national plan and 0.26% lower than the same period last year, achieving a double leap in output and quality. The conference pointed out that the geological and production technical conditions of each coal mine are different, so these experiences should be promoted according to the specific conditions of each mine and in light of local conditions.

The conference also requested that each mine establish high-yield and high-quality pacesetters, create experience, and hold on-site meetings in a timely manner to promote them.

### 减少灰石　增产块煤  煤炭工业部号召煤矿职工提高质量

　　减少灰石　增产块煤
    煤炭工业部号召煤矿职工提高质量
    新华社天津16日电　煤炭工业部最近在开滦煤矿召开了全国重点煤矿煤炭质量会议，围绕着大力提高煤炭质量的中心议题，广泛交流经验，制订了提高煤质的具体措施。会议号召全国煤矿职工苦干巧干三十天，要使煤炭灰、石少一分（煤里含的灰分和含?率降低1％），块煤加一番。
    会议指出，从3月初全国煤矿红旗竞赛广播大会以来，大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动已经在全国各煤矿普遍展开，并且取得了巨大的成绩。由于全体职工找窍门提建议，大闹技术革命，突破生产技术上的薄弱环节，煤炭产量扶摇直上，超额一百八十六万吨完成了首季煤产计划，出现了第一个生产高潮。
    会议认为，随着大面积丰产运动的深入发展，各煤矿职工在大力提高产量的同时，还必须更好地提高煤炭的质量。因为煤炭质量的好坏，直接影响着钢铁和其他工业产品的产量和质量的提高。如果精煤的灰分减少1％，高炉的焦炭消耗就能减少2.86％。而且，降低煤炭灰分和含?率，还可以节省大量的运输工具和运输费用。
    会议认为，煤炭质量的好坏，在很大程度上决定于采煤方法，因此，在开采伪顶和夹?石多的煤层时，大力推行分采分运的先进经验，尽可能地使?石不出井或少出井，这是提高煤质的最好办法。同时，建立和健全煤质管理机构及检查制度，对于提高煤炭质量，也十分重要。因此，各煤矿应当发动职工群众建立起群众性的煤质检查网，每个生产组和队，要设两三人兼作煤质检查员，负责领导组队的煤质检查工作。
    会上，各地代表还交流了开滦和峰峰等煤矿发动职工群众提高煤炭质量的先进经验。其中，开滦煤矿依靠群众提高煤质的先进经验，特别受到各地代表的好评。这个矿由于发动职工改进采煤方法，建立了群众性的煤质检查网，使今年第一季度煤的灰分和含?率比国家计划降低了0.27％，比去年同期降低了0.26％，作到了产量、质量双跃进。会议指出，各个煤矿地质和生产技术等条件不同，因而要根据各矿具体情况，因地制宜地推广这些经验。
    会议还要求各矿树立高产高质标兵，创造经验，及时召开现场会议加以推广。
