Comrades representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. In 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our more than 600 million people, after a year of hard work, achieved great accomplishments. The Great Leap Forward of 1958 pointed out the direction and path for our country to continue to move forward in the future, created a favorable situation for continued Great Leap Forward in the future, and further strengthened our confidence in striving for greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward. Jiangsu Province, like all parts of the country, under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, through the concerted efforts of the people of the province, has achieved a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, realized the people's commune system in the rural areas, and greatly improved the socialist and communist consciousness of the people. The work in the province has undergone significant changes.

The great victory of the nationwide rectification movement has greatly promoted the further development of the productive forces.

The achievements of the Great Leap Forward in our province are inseparable from the great victory of the nationwide rectification movement. Last year, throughout the province, we grasped the general program of rectification, taking production as the center, driving all tasks forward together, and ushering in a situation of two upsurges in rectification and production. Through the rectification movement, the internal relations of the people of the province were systematically adjusted. Leading cadres at all levels greatly improved their work style, cast off bureaucratic airs, shared weal and woe with the masses, and became one with them; the masses' trust in the cadres was greatly strengthened, and the relationship between cadres and the masses became closer. Through the socialist democratic forms of great airing of views, great blooming of ideas, and great debate, the people extensively and deeply carried out criticism and self-criticism, and the people's socialist consciousness was greatly enhanced. Cadres' participation in physical labor played a significant role in improving the relationship between cadres and the masses. More than 140,000 cadres were transferred to lower levels throughout the province. Cadres working in rural areas generally took the lead in participating in labor and cultivating experimental fields. In industrial and mining enterprises, the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" were also implemented. Through this series of work, the socialist mutual assistance and cooperation between leaders and the led, between cadres and the masses, between mental and manual laborers, and between cities and villages were greatly developed. Everywhere there was a new atmosphere of vigor and vitality, and a political situation began to form that was both centralized and democratic, disciplined and free, unified in will and personally cheerful and lively. The victory of the rectification movement in the province made the superstructure more suitable for the economic base and the relations of production more suitable for the productive forces, liberated people's thinking, stimulated the people's soaring enthusiasm, and thus greatly promoted the further development of the productive forces, and the socialist construction cause saw a flying leap forward.

Last year's economic construction development speed far exceeded any year in history; people's material and cultural lives have been improved accordingly.

In 1958, the development speed of economic construction in our province far exceeded any year in history. Taking the total value of industrial and agricultural output (including the seven counties of Songjiang, etc., which have been assigned to Shanghai) as an example, in 1957, it increased by 41 percent compared with the year before the start of the First Five-Year Plan, while in 1958, it increased by 72.75 percent compared with 1957. Among them, the industrial output value (excluding community-run industries) increased by 82.83 percent, and the agricultural output value increased by 61.78 percent compared with 1957. The total investment in capital construction completed throughout the year was 84.8 percent of the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period. Fiscal revenue increased by 50.5 percent compared with 1957.

The total grain output of our province in 1958 increased by 88.1 percent compared with 1957. The total cotton output increased by 60.26 percent compared with 1957. Forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline production have also developed considerably. The main industrial products of our province have also completed and overfulfilled the 1958 plan. Steel production increased by two times; pig iron production increased by 70 times; metal cutting machine tool production increased by 5.6 times; coal increased by 87 percent; electricity generation increased by 40 percent; cotton yarn increased by 67 percent; and freight volume increased by 1.3 times.

With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the material and cultural lives of the people in our province have been improved accordingly. The total commodity circulation throughout the province increased by 24.4 percent compared with 1957. Social purchasing power increased by 18.8 percent compared with 1957. The average income of farmers throughout the province increased by about 40 percent in 1958 compared with 1957. Due to the increase in the number of employed people and the basic elimination of unemployment, the income of workers throughout the province has also increased to varying degrees. In both cities and rural areas, people's lives have generally improved. In 1958, our province basically popularized primary school education, developed secondary education, and established a large number of agricultural middle schools. The number of colleges and universities increased from 16 in 1957 to 74. The implementation of the Party's education policy has brought a new look to education work. Great achievements have been made in literacy work, and spare-time education has also been greatly developed. The patriotic health movement has achieved a great victory, and schistosomiasis, which has long harmed people's health, has been basically eliminated.

The great leap forward in industry in our province has changed the unreasonable situation in industry that has been left over from history for a long time. The situation where there was only production of means of subsistence and very little production of means of production, the situation where industry was concentrated in the Nanjing-Shanghai area and the industrial base in the vast areas of northern Jiangsu was very weak, the situation where only repair and assembly could be done, not manufacturing, or only general products could be manufactured, not designing and manufacturing large and medium-sized, more advanced, and more precise products, have all undergone significant changes. The great leap forward in agriculture in our province has not only increased production in the originally low-yielding areas, but also doubled production in the high-yielding areas; not only have high-yielding crops such as rice and sweet potatoes greatly increased, but also traditionally low-yielding crops such as wheat and soybeans have also increased significantly; not only has production increased in areas where natural disasters are relatively light, but also the degree of damage has been reduced in areas where natural disasters are more severe.

Last year's great leap forward in agriculture was the result of the masses' vigorous struggle against natural disasters. People showed great strength and wisdom in the struggle.

The broad masses of working people deeply realized that last year's great leap forward in agriculture was not easily achieved, but was the result of everyone's vigorous struggle against natural disasters, especially drought and flood disasters. In the fight against drought, for example, the masses in Jiangning County once passed more than 200 waterwheels and climbed over mountains 150 meters high to bring water from the Yangtze River, 60 miles away, to the drought-stricken area, doubling the yield compared with the previous year. The mountainous areas of Changzhou Prefecture suffered a hundred days of severe drought. After breaking the superstition that "production cannot be increased in the event of a disaster," the people of the entire prefecture put forward the battle cry of "Rather climb a thousand mountains than let an acre of seedlings dry up," and fought for grain with nature; many places opened mountains and split ridges to divert water up the mountains. For example, the masses in Lishui County dug a canal more than 30 miles long to divert lake water to irrigate farmland and protect seedlings; it was through such arduous struggles that the grain output of the entire prefecture increased by 54.2 percent compared with 1957. Such heroic deeds are abundant in the vast rural areas, which eloquently shows that the soaring enthusiasm of the people has a great role in the struggle to transform society and transform nature. The people have seen the future clearly and understand the principle of "a few years of hard work, many years of happiness," their labor enthusiasm is high, and they have shown great strength and wisdom in the struggle to create history and create a new life.

The people's communes showed great superiority as soon as they were established, promoted the great leap forward in agriculture and the great development of industry, and led the people to a better tomorrow.

With the tremendous leap forward in production and construction and the improvement of the people's consciousness, the people's commune system was realized in the rural areas of our province in October 1958. The number of peasant households participating in the communes accounted for 99.7 percent of the total number of households in the province. Once the people's communes were established, they showed great superiority, promoted the great leap forward in agriculture and the great development of industry. Now there are more than 12,000 newly built community-run industries in the province; the implementation of the distribution system combining wages and supply has guaranteed and improved the lives of the broad masses of farmers. The farmers said: Food is free, which has freed them from the worries of eating and wearing clothes for thousands of years and aroused their thoughts on doing a good job in production; the establishment of collective undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries has liberated women's labor force, and 7 million women throughout the province have been liberated from housework and put into industrial and agricultural production; the people's communes have played an extremely good role in water conservancy construction, in the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and in the implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture; the people have realized from all aspects that the people's communes have brought them significant benefits and will lead them to a better tomorrow. Many commune members expressed their love and support for the people's communes with sayings such as "nine satisfactions" and "ten satisfactions." They said: Thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first; thousands of plans, the mass line is the first; thousands of good things, the people's commune is the best. Since the beginning of this year, our province has also carried out the work of rectification and construction of the people's communes, resolutely implemented the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, improved the management system, implemented unified leadership, decentralized management, and decentralized accounting, handled some policy issues left over from the communization movement, improved the work style of cadres, and the people's communes have become more consolidated, directly promoting the high tide of the spring production movement. Numerous facts show that after a series of rectification and construction work, our rural people's communes are flourishing.

Over the past year, the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in our province have been enormous. The acquisition of these achievements is due to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, is due to the correctness of the Party's general line of socialist construction and the complete set of policies of walking on two legs, is due to the people of the province carrying forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, exerting soaring enthusiasm in various construction posts, and carrying out hard work, and the broad masses of cadres have also done a lot of beneficial work in the past year, showing the great enthusiasm of a communist. Of course, while achieving great achievements, there are also some shortcomings and errors in our work, and we are earnestly overcoming them. The broad masses of the people realize that these local, individual, and temporary shortcomings, compared with the great achievements we have made, are only a problem of one finger among ten fingers. In any case, it cannot cover up the brilliant and splendid achievements of 1958. The people are to gradually gain experience in practice, and their understanding of the essence of things is also to be gradually deepened. In such a large-scale and unprecedented movement, it is not surprising that some shortcomings appear. As long as we face up to these shortcomings, analyze the reasons for their occurrence, and find solutions, we will definitely move forward better. Now, the people of the province are actively engaged in the new battle tasks of 1959 with greater ambition and more enthusiasm. The people have seen with their own eyes that their country is becoming stronger day by day and that the people's lives are improving day by day, and their emotions are full of joy.

This year, we must hold the red flag of the general line higher, establish greater ambitions, encourage greater enthusiasm, be full of confidence, overcome difficulties, and move from victory to greater victory.

1959 is a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard work, and it is also the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland. In this year, we must hold the red flag of the general line higher, follow the spirit of the Sixth and Seventh Plenary Sessions of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and, according to the 1959 national economic plan passed by this conference and the specific situation of our province, establish greater ambitions, encourage greater enthusiasm, strive for the upstream, continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, give full play to the potential of all aspects, launch a vigorous mass movement, and, on the basis of the great victory of 1958, achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

Our task in 1959 is glorious and arduous. Because the base number is large, the absolute number of increased production is much larger than in 1958. Therefore, achieving such a greater leap forward is by no means easy. However, we are full of confidence. Because we have the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have the Party's general line of socialist construction and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, which are the most fundamental guarantee for continued great leap forward. In addition, this year we have many more favorable conditions than last year, our material foundation is stronger than in the past, and our experience in industrial and agricultural production is richer than in the past. The people's communes, after rectification and construction, will show greater superiority in this year's great leap forward in agricultural production. Our potential for continued progress is great. As long as we despise difficulties strategically, pay attention to difficulties tactically, make full use of the rich experience since the Great Leap Forward, carefully calculate and arrange the relations of all aspects, continue to advocate "ten-point indicators, twelve-point measures, and twenty-four-point enthusiasm," and strive to overcome difficulties one by one, we will definitely win greater victories.

Judging from the current situation, the spring production upsurge in rural areas this year has surpassed last spring. A production brigade cadre of a commune said: Compared with last year, this spring has eight "mores," that is, "enthusiasm is greater than last year, attendance is more sufficient than last year, work efficiency is higher than last year, and work is grasped earlier, deeper, more meticulously, more practically, and more comprehensively than last year." The implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture is also very good. The broad masses of farmers are enthusiastic and have launched a large-scale high-yield red flag competition, grasping wheat management and spring plowing and spring planting firmly, and striving for the first victory. As long as there are no irresistible natural disasters, we believe that we can achieve a greater victory than last year. On the industrial front, the workers of the province have been mobilized to resolutely implement the policy of "the whole country as one chessboard" and strive for the unified national plan, first ensuring the needs of key construction. Among the workers of the province, the nine-comparison movement, centered on technological revolution and aimed at improving labor productivity, has also been widely carried out. The broad masses, with soaring enthusiasm and high labor enthusiasm, have invested in the battle of the second quarter, the decisive season, and are constantly creating new achievements.

We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will implement the spirit of this conference, fully mobilize all positive factors, resolutely rely on the masses in our work, fully follow the mass line, grasp firmly, practically, comprehensively, early, deeply, and meticulously, we have firm confidence to comprehensively and overfulfill the 1959 plan and move from victory to a greater victory.

    农村人民公社蒸蒸日上
    管文蔚代表介绍江苏省大跃进的巨大成就各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告和李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告。一九五八年，我国六亿多人民，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，经过一年苦战，获得了伟大的成就。一九五八年的大跃进指明了我国今后继续前进的方向和道路，为今后继续大跃进造成了一个有利的形势，更加强了我们为争取实现更大更好更全面的跃进的信心。江苏省和全国各地一样，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，经过全省人民一致的努力，工农业生产取得了大的跃进，全省农村实现了人民公社化，人民群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟大大提高，全省的工作面貌发生了显著的变化。
    全民整风运动的伟大胜利，大大促进了生产力的进一步发展
    我省大跃进的成就，是和全民整风运动的伟大胜利分不开的。去年，我们在全省范围内，抓住了整风这条总纲，以生产为中心、带动各项工作一道前进，掀起了整风和生产两高涨的局面。经过整风运动，全省人民内部的关系得到了系统的调整。各级领导干部大大改进了作风，打掉了官气，和群众同甘共苦，打成一片；群众对于干部的信任大为加强，干部和群众的关系更加密切。人民群众通过大鸣大放大辩论这种社会主义的民主形式，广泛深刻地开展了批评与自我批评，人民的社会主义觉悟有了很大的提高。干部参加体力劳动，对于改进干群关系，起了显著的作用。全省下放干部十四万多人。在农村工作的干部，普遍带头参加劳动，种试验田，在工矿企业中，也实行了“两参、一改、三结合”。经过这样一系列的工作，领导与被领导之间，干部与群众之间，脑力劳动者与体力劳动者之间，城市与农村之间，社会主义的互助合作关系大大发展起来，到处出现了朝气蓬勃的新气象，开始形成了一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面。全省整风运动的胜利，使上层建筑更加适合于经济基础，生产关系更加适合于生产力，解放了人们的思想，激发了人民的冲天干劲，因而大大促进了生产力的进一步发展，出现了社会主义建设事业的飞跃前进。
    去年经济建设发展速度，远远超过历史上任何一年；人民物质生活和文化生活都相应提高
    一九五八年，我省经济建设的发展速度，远远超过了历史上任何一年。拿工农业总产值（包括已划给上海市的松江等七个县）来说，一九五七年比第一个五年计划开始前一年增长百分之四十一，而一九五八年就比一九五七年增长了百分之七十二点七五。其中，工业产值（不包括社办工业）增长了百分之八十二点八三，农业产值比一九五七年增长了百分之六十一点七八。全年完成基本建设的投资，为第一个五年计划时期投资总和的百分之八十四点八。财政收入比一九五七年增长百分之五十点五。
    我省一九五八年的粮食总产量，比一九五七年增长百分之八十八点一。棉花总产量比一九五七年增长百分之六十点二六。林业、牧业、渔业、副业生产也都有相当的发展。我省工业的主要产品，也完成和超额完成了一九五八年的计划。钢产量增长二倍；生铁产量增长七十倍；金属切削机床产量增长五点六倍；煤增长百分之八十七；发电量增长百分之四十；棉纱增长百分之六十七；货运量增长一点三倍。
    随着工农业生产的迅速发展，我省人民的物质生活和文化生活都有了相应的提高。全省商品流通总量比一九五七年增长百分之二十四点四。社会购买力比一九五七年增长百分之十八点八。全省农民的平均收入，一九五八年比一九五七年增加百分之四十左右。由于就业人数的增多，失业现象的基本消灭，全省工人的收入，也有了不同程度的增加。在城市和农村，人民的生活一般地都得到了改善。一九五八年，我省基本上普及了小学教育，发展了中等教育，大量兴办了农业中学。高等学校由一九五七年的十六所增加到七十四所。党的教育方针的贯彻执行，使教育工作的面貌焕然一新。扫盲工作取得了很大的成绩，业余教育也有了很大发展。爱国卫生运动取得了很大胜利，长期以来危害人民健康的血吸虫病已经基本上消灭。
    我省工业的大跃进，使历史上长期遗留下来的工业上的不合理状况，有了改变。那种只有生活资料生产，而很少有生产资料生产的状况，那种工业集中在宁沪沿线，而苏北广大地区工业基础十分薄弱的状况，那种只能修配、不能制造，或者只能制造一般产品，不能设计、制造大中型的、比较高级的、比较精密的产品的状况，都有了显著的改变。我省农业的大跃进，不但原来低产地区得到增产，而且高产地区也成倍增产；不但水稻、薯类等高产作物大大增产，而且三麦、大豆等向来低产的作物，也有很大幅度的增产；不但在自然灾害较轻的地区增产，而且在遭受自然灾害较严重的地区，也减轻了受害的程度。
    去年农业大跃进是群众以冲天干劲同自然灾害作了顽强斗争的结果。人们在斗争中显示了巨大的力量和智慧
    广大劳动群众都深刻体会到，去年我们农业的大跃进，并不是轻易得来的，是大家以冲天的干劲同自然灾害，特别是旱涝灾害，作了顽强的斗争的结果。在抗旱斗争中，如江宁县的群众曾经经过二百多道水车，翻过一百五十公尺高的山头，将六十里外的长江水，引进了干旱地区，使产量比前年翻了一番。常州专区的山区，遭到百日大旱，全区人民在破除“有灾不能增产”的迷信后，提出“宁翻千道山，不旱一亩苗”的战斗口号，与天争粮；许多地方开山劈岭，引水上山，如溧水县群众，就挖了一条三十多里长的渠道，引湖水灌山田，保住了禾苗；正是经过这样的艰苦斗争，全专区粮食产量比一九五七年增产百分之五十四点二。像这样的英勇事迹，在广大农村中是大量存在的，它雄辩地说明了人民群众的冲天干劲，在改造社会、改造自然的斗争中，具有伟大的作用。人民群众看清了前途，懂得了“几年辛苦，多年幸福”的道理，他们的劳动热情是高涨的，他们在创造历史、创造新生活的斗争中，显示了巨大的力量和智慧。
    人民公社一建立就显示了巨大的优越性，促进了农业大跃进，工业大发展，它把人民群众引向更加美好的明天
    随着生产建设的巨大跃进和人民群众觉悟的提高，在一九五八年十月，我省农村实现了人民公社化。参加公社的农户占全省总农户百分之九十九点七。人民公社一经建立起来，就显示了巨大的优越性，促进了农业的大跃进，工业的大发展，现在全省新建的社办工业，就有一万二千多所；工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度的实行，使广大农民的生活得到保证和改善，农民说：吃饭不要钱，使他们放下了几千年来愁吃愁穿的心思，提起了搞好生产的心思；公共食堂、托儿所等集体事业的兴办，解放了妇女劳动力，全省七百万妇女从家务中解放出来，投入了工农业生产；人民公社对于水利建设，对于农林牧副渔的全面发展，对于农业“八字宪法”的贯彻执行　起了极其良好的作用；人民群众从各方面体会到：人民公社给他们带来了显著的利益，并将把他们引向更加美好的明天。许多社员用“九满意”、“十满意”等等的说法，表达了他们对于人民公社的热爱和拥护。他们说：千条万条，党的领导第一条；千计万计，群众路线第一计；千好万好，要数人民公社第一好。今年年初以来，我省又开展了整顿和建设人民公社的工作，坚决贯彻执行了党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，健全了经营管理制度，实行了统一领导、分级管理、分级核算，处理了公社化运动中遗留下来的一些政策问题，改进了干部作风，人民公社已经更加巩固，直接推动了春季生产运动的高潮。大量的事实表明，经过一系列的整顿和建设工作，我们的农村人民公社正在蒸蒸日上。
    一年来，我省大跃进的成绩是巨大的。这些成绩的获得，是由于党中央和毛主席的英明领导，是由于党的社会主义建设总路线和用两条腿走路的一整套方针的正确，是由于全省人民发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，在各个建设岗位上发挥了冲天干劲，进行了辛勤的劳动，还有广大干部，在过去一年中，做了大量的有益的工作，表现了作为一个共产主义者的极大的积极性。当然，在取得巨大成绩的同时，我们的工作中也存在着一些缺点和错误，我们正在认真地加以克服。广大人民群众都认识到，这些局部的、个别的、暂时性的缺点和我们所取得的巨大成绩比较起来，只不过是十个指头中一个指头的问题，无论如何，它掩盖不了一九五八年的光辉灿烂的成就。人民群众是要在实践中逐步取得经验的，他们对事物本质的认识，也是要逐步加深的。在这样一个规模巨大的、史无前例的运动中，出现一些缺点是毫不奇怪的。只要我们正视这些缺点，很好地分析它产生的原因，找出解决的办法，我们就一定会前进得更好。现在，全省人民正以更大的雄心、更足的干劲，积极投入了一九五九年的新的战斗任务。人民群众亲眼看到自己的国家一天天强盛起来，人民的生活一天天改善，他们情绪是充满欢乐的。
    今年要更高地举起总路线的红旗，立更大志气，鼓更大干劲，满怀信心，克服困难，从胜利走向更大胜利
    一九五九年是苦战三年中具有决定意义的一年，又逢伟大祖国国庆十周年。在这一年中，我们一定要更高地举起总路线的红旗，遵照党的八届六中全会和七中全会的精神，根据这次大会通过的一九五九年度的国民经济计划和我省的具体情况，立更大的志气，鼓更大的干劲，力争上游，继续发扬苦干、实干、巧干的精神，充分发挥各方面的潜在力量，开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动，在一九五八年伟大胜利的基础上，实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    我们一九五九年的任务是光荣而又艰巨的。由于基数大了，增产的绝对数也就比一九五八年大得多，因此，要实现这样一个更大的跃进，决不是轻而易举的。但是，我们充满着信心。因为我们有党中央、毛主席的正确领导，有党的社会主义建设总路线和用两条腿走路的一整套方针，这些都是继续大跃进的最根本的保证。此外，今年我们还有许多比去年更有利的条件，我们的物质基础比过去更加雄厚了，在工农业生产方面的经验比过去更加丰富了。人民公社经过整顿和建设，它在今年农业生产的大跃进中将会显示出更大的优越性。我们继续前进的潜力是很大的。只要我们在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，充分运用大跃进以来的丰富经验，切实计算和安排各方面的关系，继续提倡“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”，努力把困难一个一个地克服下去，我们一定会赢得更大的胜利。
    从当前的情况来看，今年农村的春季生产高潮超过了去年春天。有个公社的生产大队干部说：今年春天和去年比起来，有八个“更”，这就是“干劲比去年更大，出勤比去年更足，工效比去年更高，工作比去年抓得更早、更深、更细、更实、更全。”农业八字宪法的贯彻执行情况，也很良好。广大农民热情高涨，开展了大面积高产红旗竞赛，狠狠地抓三麦管理和春耕春种，力争首战胜利。只要没有不可抗拒的自然灾害，我们相信，一定可以取得比去年更大的胜利。在工业战线上，现在全省职工都动员起来，坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，为统一的国家计划而奋斗，首先保证重点建设的需要。在全省职工中，以技术革命为中心、以提高劳动生产率为目标的九比运动，也已经广泛开展，广大群众都以冲天的干劲，高度的劳动热情，投入了第二季这个决定性季节的战斗，不断地创造出新的成绩。
    我们深信，在党中央、毛主席的领导下，贯彻执行这次大会的精神，把一切积极因素充分动员起来，在工作中坚决依靠群众，充分走群众路线，抓紧、抓实、抓全、抓早、抓深、抓细，我们有坚强的信心，全面地和超额地完成一九五九年的计划，从胜利走向更加伟大的胜利。
