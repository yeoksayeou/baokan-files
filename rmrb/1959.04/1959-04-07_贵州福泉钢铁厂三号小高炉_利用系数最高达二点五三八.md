Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, April 6th. The No. 3 blast furnace of Fuquan Steel Plant in Weng'an County, Guizhou, produced 16.502 tons of pig iron on April 2nd, with an effective volume utilization coefficient reaching 2.538 and a coke ratio dropping below 1, setting a new record for the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in Guizhou Province.

This small blast furnace with an effective volume of 6.5 cubic meters saw a surge in its utilization coefficient to 2.469 and a drop in the coke ratio to 0.82 starting from March 27th. In the recent week, it has maintained high production continuously. Except for one day when the coefficient was slightly lower, the utilization coefficient has remained above 2 for the rest of the days, and the coke ratio has not exceeded 1. The quality of pig iron fully meets the standards stipulated by the state.

The main measures taken by the No. 3 blast furnace of Fuquan Steel Plant to maintain high production are: 1. Increasing smelting intensity. By increasing the air volume and pressure, the blast temperature of the No. 3 blast furnace has risen from over 300 degrees to over 500 degrees. This has increased the daily charging from 180 batches to 240-270 batches (100 kilograms of ore per batch). 2. Improving raw materials, allowing the blast furnace to consume "fine grains" and "refined grains." In the past, the blast furnace often consumed several types of ore with different particle sizes and varying grades, which often affected production. Now, all the ore has been changed to ore with an iron content of over 60% and a particle size of about 20-25 mm before being charged into the furnace, stabilizing the composition of the ore. 3. Rationally allocating materials and reducing slag volume. In the past, in order to change the high sulfur content of pig iron, a large amount of limestone was often added during smelting to create slag for desulfurization. Although the sulfur content of pig iron was reduced to 0.02%, it affected production. Now, by appropriately reducing limestone, the sulfur content of pig iron can still be maintained below 0.2%, but the amount of slag has been reduced from 0.5-0.6 to 0.4-0.5. 4. Implementing a diligent ash cleaning and inspection system for hot blast stoves, keeping the air ducts leak-free, and ensuring that the temperature is stabilized above 500 degrees. The combined effect of all these measures has reduced the coke ratio of this furnace and doubled the daily output of iron compared to the past. (Attached picture)

### 贵州福泉钢铁厂三号小高炉  利用系数最高达二点五三八

     贵州福泉钢铁厂三号小高炉
    利用系数最高达二点五三八
     新华社贵阳6日电　贵州瓮安县福泉钢铁厂三号高炉，在4月2日一天里炼出生铁一六点五零二吨，有效容积利用系数达到二点五三八，焦比降到一以下，创造了贵州省小高炉利用系数的最高纪录。
    这座有效容积六点五立方公尺的小高炉，从3月27日起利用系数猛升到二点四六九、焦比降低到零点八二以后，最近一周中连续高产，除了有一天稍低以外，其余几天利用系数都保持在二以上，焦比未超过一，生铁质量完全符合国家规定的标准。
    福泉钢铁厂三号高炉保持高产的主要措施是：一、提高冶炼强度。由于加大了风量风压，三号高炉的风温由三百多度上升到五百多度。这样就使每天下料由一百八十批提高到二百四十至二百七十批（每批一百公斤矿石）。二、改善原材料，让高炉吃“精粮”和“细粮”。过去高炉经常吃粒度大小不同、品位高低不一的几种矿石，因此生产常受影响；现在把矿石一律改成含铁量在60％以上、粒度在二十至二十五公厘左右下炉，稳定了矿石的成份。三、合理配料，减少渣量。过去为了改变生铁含硫高的情况，冶炼时常加入大量石灰石造渣去硫，生铁含硫量虽然降低到了0.02％，但是却影响了产量；现在适当减少石灰石，生铁的含硫量仍能保持在0.2％以下，炉渣量却由零点五至零点六降低到零点四至零点五。四、实行了对热风炉的勤清灰、勤检查制度，保持风管不漏风，保证使温度稳定在五百度以上。所有这些措施的综合效果，就使这座炉子的焦比降低，铁的日产量比过去翻了一番。（附图片）
