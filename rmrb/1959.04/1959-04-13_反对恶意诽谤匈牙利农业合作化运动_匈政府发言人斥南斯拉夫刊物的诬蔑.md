Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 11th: Hungarian government spokesman Járos condemned the Yugoslav magazine "Review of International Affairs" for slandering Hungary's socialist transformation of agriculture at a press conference held on the 10th.

Járos pointed out that this publication has very close ties with the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, and every word it publishes must be approved by the State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, so its official position is very clear. It seems that the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs has forgotten the principle of not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

Járos said that the article by Steiner Egon published in the Yugoslav "Review of International Affairs" is consistent with the tone of Radio Free Europe's slander of Hungarian farmers for several weeks. They insisted that Hungarian farmers embarked on the path of socialist agricultural collectivization under the influence of violence. The article published in "Review of International Affairs" also maliciously claimed that the current "form of merger" in Hungary is so-called "unsuitable for Hungarian farmers."

Járos pointed out that Hungarian farmers have voluntarily embarked on the road of large-scale collective management in the first three months of this year. The great achievements of the agricultural production cooperative movement have confirmed that Hungarian farmers have found the most suitable form. The slander of the Yugoslav gentlemen cannot change these facts.

Járos added that it is not Steiner Egon's business what form Hungarian farmers like to use to merge.

　　反对恶意诽谤匈牙利农业合作化运动
　　匈政府发言人斥南斯拉夫刊物的诬蔑
    新华社布达佩斯11日电　匈牙利政府发言人贾罗什在10日举行的记者招待会上谴责南斯拉夫杂志“国际事务评论”对匈牙利农业社会主义改造的诬蔑。
    贾罗什指出，这家刊物同南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处的关系是非常密切的，它发表的每字每句都要经过外交国务秘书处的批准，所以它的官方立场是很明显的。看来，南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处忘掉了不得干涉其他国家内政的原则。
    贾罗什说，南斯拉夫“国际事务评论”发表的斯泰纳·埃贡的文章，同自由欧洲电台几周以来诬蔑匈牙利农民的声调是一致的。他们硬说什么匈牙利农民在暴力的影响下走上社会主义农业集体化的道路。“国际事务评论”发表的这篇文章并且恶意声称，目前匈牙利的“合并的形式”是所谓“不适合于匈牙利农民的”。
    贾罗什指出，匈牙利农民在今年头三个月内纷纷自愿走上了大规模的集体经营的道路。农业生产合作社运动发展的伟大成就证实了匈牙利农民找到了最适合的形式。南斯拉夫先生们的诬蔑是改变不了这些事实的。
    贾罗什又说，匈牙利农民喜欢用那种形式来合并，也决不是斯泰纳·埃贡的事。
