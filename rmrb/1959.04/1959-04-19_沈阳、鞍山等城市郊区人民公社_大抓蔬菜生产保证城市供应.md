Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th: People's communes in the suburbs of various cities in Liaoning Province are vigorously developing vegetable production to ensure the supply of vegetables to the cities.

    The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided that this year the supply of vegetables to ten cities, including Shenyang, Anshan, and Fushun, will mainly rely on the suburbs. Since February, the people's communes in the suburbs of various cities have actively expanded the area for vegetable cultivation, linked up with commercial departments, signed production and sales contracts, and formulated plans for developing vegetables. People's communes in the suburbs of Anshan have prepared sufficient fertilizer, water sources, land, and labor to ensure the city's vegetable supply. Some communes' vegetable farmers have also staggered the sowing dates of various vegetables to ensure they are marketed at different times, achieving a variety of products and year-round greenery. In the suburbs of Shenyang, 120,000 mu of vegetable fields have been fully irrigated, and the vegetable fields in various places are generally fertilized with more than 20,000 jin per mu, with some reaching 60,000 jin.

    At present, the suburbs of various cities in Liaoning Province are vigorously grasping the work of raising seedlings and sowing early-maturing vegetables. In the suburbs of Benxi, 80% of the vegetables are being raised in warm beds. Cucumbers have already sprouted leaves, and tomato seedlings have grown to five inches high. In the suburbs of Andong, the work of raising vegetable seedlings was completed on March 20, and transplanting is underway. Spinach in various places has been marketed half a month earlier than in previous years.

　　大抓蔬菜生产保证城市供应
    新华社沈阳18日电　辽宁省各城市郊区人民公社大抓蔬菜生产，保证城市蔬菜供应。
    中共辽宁省委决定，今年沈阳、鞍山、抚顺等十个市的蔬菜主要依靠郊区供应。2月份以来，各城市郊区的人民公社都积极扩大了蔬菜种植面积，并且和商业部门挂钩，签订产销合同，制订了发展蔬菜的规划。鞍山市各郊区人民公社为保证城市的蔬菜供应，为蔬菜生产准备了足够的肥料、水源、土地和劳力。有的公社的菜农并把各种蔬菜的播种日期排开，以便分期上市，做到品种多样，四季常青。沈阳郊区有十二万亩菜田已经全部水利化，各地的菜田一般每亩施肥二万斤以上，多的达到六万斤。
    目前，辽宁省各城市郊区正在大抓育苗和早熟蔬菜的播种工作。本溪市郊区有80％的蔬菜都进行了温床育苗，现在黄瓜已经放叶，西红柿的小苗已经长到五寸高了。安东市郊区3月20日即全部结束蔬菜育苗工作，正在进行移栽。各地的菠菜，已经比往年提早半个月上市。
