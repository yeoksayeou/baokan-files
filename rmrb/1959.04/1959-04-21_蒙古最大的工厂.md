    Mongolia's Largest Factory
    The Mongolian Industrial Combine Factory is one of the earliest industrial enterprises established in Mongolia and is currently the largest factory in Mongolia.
    Not long ago, on the joyous occasion of the factory's 25th anniversary, the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia awarded the factory the highest national medal—the Sukhe-Bator Medal—in recognition of its merits in producing tens of millions of products and creating huge wealth for the country and the people over the past 25 years.
    The Industrial Combine Factory is located in the southern suburbs of the Mongolian capital.
    The factory originally had six branches, including leather, felt making, shoe making, and wool washing, and its products included leather, leather shoes, felt, and felt boots made from various livestock hides and wool, totaling more than 150 varieties. These products mainly meet the needs of the domestic people, and some products, such as soft lambskin and wool, are also sold abroad. In the past 25 years, the total output of the combined factory has increased 17 times. At present, the factory can produce products worth more than 45.5 million tugriks (Mongolian currency) annually.
    In the early days of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, the young republic had only a few industrial enterprises. In 1930, the Great People's Hural of Mongolia regarded the development of industry as an important construction task and decided to build a factory to process the country's livestock products to meet the needs of the people's lives. With the help of the Soviet Union, the Industrial Combine Factory began construction in 1931 and was officially put into production in March 1934. The establishment of this large factory has extremely important significance for Mongolia's industrial development. It marks that this country, which was originally dominated by animal husbandry production, has embarked on the road of industrial development.
    During the construction of Mongolia's first and second five-year plans, the workers of the combined factory always stood at the forefront of production and completed the country's production tasks on schedule or ahead of schedule. At present, in order to complete the historical tasks of the three-year plan and complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule, all employees of the factory are extensively carrying out labor competitions between workshops and groups, setting off a wave of labor production enthusiasm.
    In the past 25 years, the combined factory has manufactured a large number of products to meet the needs of people's lives. For example, since its establishment, the factory has produced nearly five million meters of felt for Mongolian yurts to meet the needs of grassland herders for housing; it has produced more than three million pairs of felt boots and more than four million four hundred thousand pairs of long riding boots to meet the needs of herders for wintering and riding; and it has also produced more than fourteen million large and small pieces of leather for sewing various daily necessities. In addition, it exported more than 1.7 million pieces of soft lambskin and 60,000 tons of wool. If in 1934, each person could only produce products worth an average of 2,965 tugriks per year, then now they can produce products worth 30,000 tugriks. The increase in labor productivity is very significant.
    This factory has a glorious history. During World War II, the factory produced a large number of felt shoes, leather shoes, and belts to support the Soviet Red Army in combating the fascist invaders. For this, it was awarded the Labor Red Banner Medal.
    With the continuous development of production, the material and cultural living standards of the workers are also improving day by day. There is a 30,000-square-meter employee residential area in the factory, and the employees live in buildings with heating, water, and electrical equipment, making life very comfortable. The factory is equipped with a 70-bed hospital, a nursery that can accommodate 300 children, and a seven-year middle school that can accommodate 2,000 students. The children of the employees live a collective life according to their different ages and receive good education.
    People regard the Industrial Combine Factory as a school for cultivating the Mongolian working class. Over the past 25 years, many herders who were originally engaged in animal husbandry production have learned production technology here and become the emerging working class in Mongolia. Factory Director Gambuzhab said that when the factory started operation in 1934, there were only more than 1,000 employees in the factory, of which only more than 500 were Mongolian workers, and most of them were novices. The rest were experts and workers sent by the Soviet Union to help Mongolia. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, Mongolian workers studied and operated at the same time, growing from unfamiliar to skilled day by day. At present, Mongolian workers have been able to replace Soviet experts and master the work of every process and every workshop in the factory. Now, there are more than 2,000 workers in the factory, and more than 500 of them have been rewarded by the state.
    This year, the factory will be further expanded and rebuilt. With the help of China and Czechoslovakia, a woolen mill and a leather factory are currently being built. The output of the expanded Industrial Combine Factory will be more than three times that of the present.

### 蒙古最大的工厂

    蒙古最大的工厂
    蒙古工业联合工厂是蒙古创立最早的工业企业之一，也是目前蒙古最大的一个工厂。
    不久以前，在这个工厂庆祝建厂二十五周年的喜庆日子里，蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团把国家最高的勋章——苏赫—巴托尔勋章授给工厂，奖励它在二十五年中为国家和人民生产千万件产品和创造巨额财富的功绩。
    工业联合工厂建立在蒙古首都的南郊。
    工厂原来有六个分厂，包括皮革、制毡、制鞋、洗毛等部分，产品有皮革、皮鞋、毡子和毡靴等各种牲畜皮、毛加工品，计有一百五十多种。这些产品主要供给本国人民的需要，有些产品如软羊皮、羊毛等也远销国外。二十五年来，联合工厂的总产量提高了十七倍。现在，工厂每年能生产价值四千五百多万图格里克（蒙币）的产品。
    在蒙古人民革命胜利的初期，年青的共和国只有少数工业企业，1930年，蒙古大人民呼拉尔把发展工业作为一项重要的建设任务，并且决定建立一个加工本国畜产品的工厂，以满足人民生活的需要。在苏联的帮助下，工业联合工厂便在1931年开始兴建，到1934年3月正式投入生产。这个大型工厂的建立，对蒙古的工业发展，有着极其重要的意义。它标志着这个原来以畜牧业生产为主的国家，走上了发展工业的道路。
    在蒙古的第一和第二个五年计划建设期间，联合工厂的工人们始终站在生产的前列，按期或提前完成了国家的生产任务。目前，全厂职工为完成三年计划的历史任务，为提前完成今年的生产计划，在车间和小组之间广泛开展劳动竞赛，掀起了一个劳动生产热潮。
    过去二十五年中，联合工厂制造了大量产品，满足人民生活的需要。例如，从建厂以来，工厂生产了近五百万公尺的蒙古包用毡，供应草原牧民居住的需要；生产了三百多万双毡靴、四百四十多万双长统马靴，满足牧民过冬和骑马的需要；还生产了一千四百多万张大、小皮革，缝制各种生活用品。此外，它向国外输出了一百七十多万张软羊皮和六万吨羊毛。如果说1934年每人每年平均只能生产价值二千九百六十五图格里克的产品，那末，目前已经能生产价值三万图格里克的产品了，劳动生产率的提高，是十分显著的。
    这个工厂有一段光荣的历史。在第二次世界大战期间，工厂生产了大批的毡鞋、皮鞋和皮带，支援苏联红军，打击法西斯侵略军。为此，它曾得到劳动红旗勋章的奖励。
    随着生产的不断发展，工人的物质和文化生活水平也在日益提高。厂内有三万平方公尺的职工住宅区，职工们住在有暖气、水、电设备的楼房里，生活很舒适。工厂附设有七十张床位的医院，能容三百名儿童的托儿所和可以收纳两千名学生的七年制中学。职工们的小孩，根据不同年龄，过着集体生活，得到很好的教养。
    人们把工业联合工厂看作是培养蒙古工人阶级的一所学校。二十五年来，许多原来从事牧业生产的牧民，在这里学会了生产技术，成为蒙古新兴的工人阶级。冈布扎布厂长说，1934年，工厂开工的时候，全厂只有一千多名职工，其中蒙古工人只有五百多人，而且多是新手，其余都是苏联派来帮助蒙古的专家和工人。蒙古工人在苏联专家们的帮助下，一面学习，一面操作，从陌生到熟练，一天天成长。目前，蒙古工人已经能够代替苏联专家，掌握全厂的每个工序、每个车间的工作。现在，全厂有两千多工人，其中五百多人曾经得到国家的奖励。
    今年，这个工厂还要进一步扩大和改建。在中国和捷克斯洛伐克的帮助下，目前正在新建一座毛纺厂和皮革厂。扩大后的工业联合工厂，生产量将是现在的三倍多。
