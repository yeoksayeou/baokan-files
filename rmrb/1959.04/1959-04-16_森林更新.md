　　Forest Regeneration
    The cultivation of new forests on harvested forest land, using manpower or natural forces, is called forest regeneration; restoring existing burned areas, sparse forest land, and forest gaps in forest areas is also called forest regeneration.
    Forest regeneration occupies a very important position in forestry construction. It is a fundamental measure to consolidate and develop existing forest bases and ensure the sustainable utilization of forests.
    The methods of forest regeneration are generally divided into three types: natural regeneration, artificial promotion of natural regeneration, and artificial regeneration. Natural regeneration is the restoration of forests by means of natural seeding from parent trees or rootstock sprouting; artificial promotion of natural regeneration essentially belongs to the category of natural regeneration, and involves carrying out land preparation and soil loosening on forest land, or clearing ground cover such as weeds, shrubs, and mosses to promote the germination and regeneration of naturally fallen seeds; artificial regeneration is the method of cultivating new forests on forest land by means of artificial planting or sowing.
    Before 1957, the main method of restoring forests in China was natural regeneration. Practice has proven that this method is limited by natural conditions, the time it takes to restore forests is very slow, the tree species that are regenerated are often not ideal, and the distribution is uneven, the growth is slow, and the yield per unit area is low. Artificial promotion of natural regeneration is slightly better, but the effect is still much worse compared to artificial regeneration. Only artificial regeneration can not only ensure the rapid restoration of harvested areas into forests, but also has the advantages of fast growth, good forest quality, and high yield. According to a survey, in the Northeast, in the same twenty-year-old Korean pine forest, artificial planting is more than six times faster than natural growth.

　　森林更新
    利用人力或借自然力，在采伐过的林地上，培育新的森林，叫做森林更新；把林区现存的火烧迹地、稀疏林地和林间空地等的森林恢复起来，也叫森林更新。
    森林更新，在林业建设事业上占着很重要的地位。它是巩固和发展现有森林基地，保证森林永续利用的根本措施。
    森林更新的方法，一般分为天然更新、人工促进天然更新和人工更新三种。天然更新，是借助于母树天然下种或根株萌芽来恢复森林；人工促进天然更新，实质属于天然更新范畴，是在林地上进行整地松土、或清除杂草灌木苔藓等地面被复物，以促进天然飞落的种子发芽更新；人工更新，是用人工栽苗或播种的办法，在林地上培育新的森林。
    我国在1957年以前，恢复森林的方法主要是天然更新。实践证明，这种方法由于受自然条件的限制，恢复成林的时间很慢，更新起来的树种，多不合乎理想，并且分布不均匀，生长慢，单位面积产量低；人工促进天然更新虽然好些，但效果与人工更新比较仍然很差；唯有人工更新，不仅可以保证采伐迹地迅速恢复成林，而且具有生长快、林质好、产量高的优点。据调查，在东北同是二十年生红松林，人工栽植的比天然生长的要快六倍多。
