　　Downward Transfer Makes Five-Good Commune Members; Work Makes Five-Good Cadres
　　Fuzhou's Thousand Cadres Use Downward Transfer Experiences as Motivation to Improve Work

　　(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 16th dispatch, reporter Liu Guanghui) After more than a thousand cadres from the Fuzhou Special District of Jiangxi Province returned to their work posts with the honor of being "Five-Good" commune members, they used their experiences and knowledge gained during their time as commune members to further improve their leadership methods and work style, powerfully promoting the current spring plowing production.

　　In January and February of this year, the Fuzhou Special District sent more than a thousand cadres in batches to production teams in various communes to be commune members. During their month as commune members, these cadres ate, lived, and worked with the peasants, gaining a great deal in all aspects. After the term ended, they returned to their original work posts in February and March, carrying the title of "Five-Good" commune members, evaluated by the commune members as good in labor, good in work, good in study, good in unity, and good in contact with the masses. After returning to their work posts, they contacted the masses and went deep into reality more closely than before, and further developed the spirit of hard struggle. The broad masses said, "Five-Good" commune members have now become "Five-Good" cadres who are good in work, good in style, good in contact with the masses, good in labor, and good in unity.

　　Through their experience as commune members, cadres deeply realized that by closely contacting the masses, and placing themselves among the masses as ordinary laborers, they became one with the masses, sharing the same feelings. Some opinions that were not easily heard in the past were heard, and many new problems related to production, work, and the lives of the masses were quickly discovered and resolved in consultation with the masses in a timely manner. Therefore, as soon as the cadres returned to their work posts, they paid special attention to further strengthening their ties with the masses, often going deep into the masses to listen to their opinions, discover problems, and study solutions together with the masses. Zhang Xuan, Deputy Secretary of the Le'an County Party Committee, spent twenty-five days working among the masses and participating in labor in the month after returning to his post. By working and talking with the commune members, Zhang Xuan learned about many new problems in production in one month, and together with the masses, summarized ten typical experiences, large and small, in production, life, and running the commune, which were very helpful to his work. For example, while transplanting rice seedlings with the commune members in Gongfang Commune, he found that the progress of rice transplanting was slow because the commune members had opinions on the rice transplanting quotas. He immediately discussed this issue with the commune members and organized them to discuss and reasonably revise the quotas. Afterwards, with the approval of the Commune Party Committee, it was promoted in various teams, which tripled the speed of rice transplanting in the whole commune. Zhang Xuan also reported this experience to the County Party Committee by telephone and promoted it in all communes in the county, thereby accelerating the progress of rice transplanting in the whole county. Xu Xinke, Deputy Secretary of the Lufang Commune Party Committee in Jinxi County, still often participated in labor in Zhuangfang Team after returning from being a commune member in the team. The commune members regarded him as a confidant and actively reported that the canteen was not well run, which affected spring plowing production. Xu Xinke immediately organized all the commune members of the team with the branch secretary to discuss how to run the canteen well. Through discussion, the commune members put forward more than 20 suggestions for improving canteen management, and the canteen was run well as a result.

　　Many cadres who had been sent down to the countryside, after returning to their work posts, selected several commune member families as base points for contacting the masses, understanding the situation, and improving their work. Zhang Yunchang, member of the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee and Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Prefectural Committee, after returning from being a commune member in the Shangli Production Team of Lufang Commune in Jinxi County, selected commune members Li Wenjun, Wu Fengxi, Li Jinlin, and others as his friend households, maintained regular contact, and listened to the opinions of the masses from the friend households in order to improve his work. Chen Laichang, a technical cadre of the Prefectural Administrative Office's Agricultural Department, had less contact with the masses in the past. This time, after returning to the agency from being a commune member in the Hedong Production Team of Baishe Commune in Nanfeng County, he actively formulated a contact system with the Hedong Production Team: sending a letter once every half month and meeting once a month, exchanging opinions and experiences in production, work, and other aspects. The commune members of the Hedong Production Team recently wrote to say that this year they were planting cotton for the first time and had no experience, and asked Chen Laichang for help. After receiving the letter, Chen Laichang immediately replied with a detailed introduction to cotton planting techniques and enclosed two books on cotton planting techniques to help the Hedong Team solve the cotton planting technology problem.

　　Going deep among the masses and conducting serious investigations and research is an outstanding improvement in the work of cadres after returning to the organs. Shi Zhenzong, Secretary of the Nanfeng County Party Committee, although he had selected the Taihe Commune as his base point for carrying out his work in the past, his understanding of the situation and arrangements for work often remained among the cadres and at the Party Committee meetings, and he rarely went deep into the production teams, groups, and commune member families. Therefore, some situations were not fully understood, and the arrangements for work were sometimes not in line with reality. Many facts educated him during his time as a commune member, making him realize that whether any work can be well implemented depends first on whether the arrangements are in line with reality, and whether it is in line with reality depends first on whether the actual situation is grasped. On the basis of raising ideological understanding, Shi Zhenzong strengthened investigation and research work after returning to his work post. Every time he arranged work, he first went deep into the production teams, groups, and commune member families to conduct a full investigation, solicit opinions from the commune members, and then held cadre meetings for repeated research, and finally arranged the work. In this way, the arranged work was in line with reality, the work went smoothly, and the commune members were very satisfied. Recently, when he arranged spring plowing production in Taihe Commune, he first went deep among the masses to conduct an investigation and found that a small number of commune members were not motivated enough, one of the reasons being that the production arrangements were not clear, and the second was that cadres participated in production less, which the commune members were not satisfied with. Shi Zhenzong submitted these situations to the commune cadres for discussion. After research, the commune comprehensively arranged spring plowing production and stipulated the time for cadres to participate in production. Within a few days after the meeting, a new upsurge of spring plowing production was formed in the whole commune, and the attendance rate rose from 80% to 100%.

　　During the time the cadres were commune members, the masses' diligence, bravery, sincerity, simplicity, and soaring revolutionary spirit profoundly educated them. Therefore, with the return of the cadres who had been sent down, a new atmosphere appeared in the work of the organs. Participating in labor, contacting the masses, helping each other, uniting, and struggling hard have become a common practice. Yang Shuzhen, a cadre of the Nancheng County Health Center, looked down on the peasants in the past and was unwilling to receive peasants who came to see a doctor. Being sent down to be a commune member made him realize that the peasants were role models for him to learn from in terms of revolutionary vigor, hard work, simplicity, and labor skills.

　　下放是五好社员　工作是五好干部
　　抚州千名干部将下放体会做为改进工作的动力
　　本报南昌16日电　记者刘光辉报道：江西省抚州专区一千多名下放干部带着“五好”社员的荣誉回到工作岗位之后，运用在当社员期间的体会和经验，进一步改进了领导方法和工作作风，有力地推动了当前的春耕生产。
    抚州专区于今年1月、2月间分批下放了一千多名干部到各公社生产队当社员。这些干部在当社员的一个月中，与农民同吃同住同劳动，各方面收获很大。期满后，他们带着由公社社员评定的劳动好、工作好、学习好、团结好、联系群众好的“五好”社员称号，分别在
  2月、3月份回到了原来的工作岗位。回到工作岗位上以后，他们比过去更加密切地联系群众、深入实际，更加发扬了艰苦奋斗的精神。广大群众说：“五好”社员现在成了工作好、作风好、联系群众好、劳动好、团结好的“五好”干部。
    干部通过当社员深深体会到：由于密切联系群众，作为一个普通劳动者置身于群众之中，因而和群众打成了一片，心心相印，一些过去不容易听到的意见听到了，许多有关生产、工作和群众生活中的新问题都很快发现了，并且及时和群众商量得到了解决。因此，干部一回到工作岗位就特别注意进一步加强与群众的联系，经常深入到群众中去听取群众的意见，发现问题，并和群众一同研究解决的办法。乐安县委副书记张萱回到工作岗位的一个月中，有二十五天是在群众中进行工作，参加劳动。由于和社员一同劳动、谈心，张萱在一个月中了解到许多生产中的新问题，并和群众一道总结了生产、生活、办社等大小十个典型经验，对他开展工作很有帮助。例如，他在龚坊公社和社员一同插秧中，发现插秧进度慢，原因是社员对插秧定额有意见。他立即和社员商量这个问题，并组织社员讨论，合理地修改了定额；之后，经公社党委批准在各队推行，使全社插秧进度加快了三倍。张萱又用电话向县委汇报了这一经验，在全县各公社推广，从而加快了全县的插秧进度。金溪县陆坊公社党委副书记徐新科从庄坊队当社员回来后，仍然经常到该队参加劳动，社员把他当做知心朋友看待，主动向他反映了食堂办得不好，影响了春耕生产的情况。徐新科立即和该队支部书记一起组织全队社员讨论怎样办好食堂；通过讨论，社员提出了二十多条改进食堂管理的意见，结果办好了食堂。
    许多下放干部回到工作岗位后，都选定了几个社员家庭做为联系群众的基点，通过联系了解情况，改进工作。抚州地委委员、地委组织部副部长张运昌由金溪县陆坊公社上李生产队当社员回来后，从该队选定社员李文俊、吴凤喜、李锦林等作为自己的朋友户，保持经常联系，从朋友户那里听取群众的意见，以改进自己的工作。专署农业处技术干部陈来昌，过去和群众联系较少。这次他从南丰县的白舍公社河东生产队当社员回机关后，积极和河东生产队制定了联系制度：半月通一次信，一月见一次面；相互交换生产、工作等方面的意见和经验。河东生产队社员最近来信说，今年他们第一次播种棉花，没有经验，要求陈来昌帮助。陈来昌接到信后立即回信详细介绍了植棉技术，并附寄了两本种棉技术书籍，帮助河东队解决了植棉技术问题。
    深入群众，认真进行调查研究，是干部回机关后在工作上的一个突出的进步。中共南丰县委书记石振宗过去虽然选定了太和公社做为自己开展工作的基点社，但是了解情况、布置工作往往都停留在干部中和党委会议上，很少深入生产队、小组和社员家庭，因而有些情况了解不全面，布置工作有时不切合实际。在当社员期间许多事实教育了他，使他认识到，每项工作能否很好的贯彻执行，首先在于是否布置得切合实际，而是否切合实际又首先决定于是否掌握了实际情况。在提高思想认识的基础上，石振宗回到工作岗位后加强了调查研究工作。每次布置工作时，他首先深入到生产队、组、社员家庭进行充分调查，征求社员意见，然后开干部会反复研究，最后布置工作。这样，布置的工作切合实际，工作进行顺利，社员们又非常满意。最近一次他在太和公社布置春耕生产时，首先深入群众进行了调查，发现少数社员干劲不足，原因之一是生产安排没有头绪，二是干部参加生产少，社员们不满意。石振宗便把这些情况提交公社干部讨论；经过研究，公社全面安排了春耕生产，规定了干部参加生产的时间。会后几天之内，全社便形成了春耕生产的新高潮，出勤率由80％上升到100％。
    干部在当社员期间，群众的那种勤劳勇敢、诚恳朴素和冲天的革命干劲，使他们受到了深刻的教育。因此，随着下放干部的归来，机关工作出现了新气象，参加劳动、联系群众，互助团结、艰苦奋斗，蔚然成风。南城县卫生院干部杨淑贞，过去看不起农民，农民来看病也不愿接待。下放当社员后使他认识到：农民无论在革命干劲、艰苦朴素、劳动技能上都是他学习的榜样。
