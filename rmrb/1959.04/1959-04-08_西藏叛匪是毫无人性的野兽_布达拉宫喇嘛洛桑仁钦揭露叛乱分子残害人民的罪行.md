Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 7th April: Lobsang Renchen, a lama from the Potala Palace, exposed the crimes of the rebels in harming the people in the Pengbo area north of Lhasa to more than 800 lamas and citizens in front of the Potala Palace on the afternoon of April 5th.

Lobsang Renchen was coerced into the Pengbo area by the rebels entrenched in the Potala Palace at dawn on March 22nd. After witnessing the rebels' crimes of rape, arson, and murder in the Pengbo area, he broke through the rebels' various obstacles and returned to Lhasa on the afternoon of April 4th.

Lobsang Renchen told the masses how the rebels used deception and threats to coerce him into leaving Lhasa. He said that at dawn on March 22nd, the rebels entrenched in the Potala Palace fled to the Pengbo area and forced him to flee with them at gunpoint. The rebels deceived him, saying that if he didn't leave, the People's Liberation Army would kill him when they arrived. Lobsang Renchen said that on the way to Pengbo, he saw the rebels killing each other due to unequal distribution of loot. After several bandits killed a comrade, they stripped the dead man of his clothes and shoes.

Lobsang Renchen exposed the rebels' looting of the masses' property and harming the people in the Pengbo area, saying that after the rebels arrived in the Pengbo area, they immediately looted everywhere. They killed the cattle in the fields for meat, robbed all the property from the people's homes, and smashed furniture such as boxes and cabinets to use as firewood. When robbing the masses of grain, the rebels also defecated and urinated on the grain they couldn't take away to prevent the masses from eating it. The rebels even forced the masses to take off the clothes they were wearing and robbed them. Lobsang Renchen said, "Now it is difficult to see cattle and horses in the Pengbo area, and almost all the livestock have been killed or robbed by the rebels. The masses are afraid of the rebels' arson, murder, and looting, and they hide in the mountains, afraid to return for spring ploughing and sowing."

Lobsang Renchen angrily exposed the crimes he witnessed of the rebels raping nuns and destroying religion. When he passed near the Gandan Qunkor Monastery in Pengbo, a middle-aged Tibetan man was sending his sister to the monastery; his sister was a nun in the monastery. On the way, ten rebels blocked their path, inhumanely gang-raped the nun, and finally killed her. Among the bandits who raped the nun were lamas who participated in the rebellion. Lobsang Renchen said that he also saw another pregnant woman who was gang-raped to death by the rebels. He angrily said: "These rebels, who fly the banner of 'protecting religion,' are just a group of inhumane beasts."

Lobsang Renchen said that in the past he was deceived by the rebels, but the rebels' evil deeds made him see their true colors. He expressed his determination to stand firmly with the people of all Tibet and actively assist the People's Liberation Army in completely quelling the rebellion. He also said that the Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata launched an armed rebellion, attempting to separate Tibet from the motherland's big family and let them continue to harm and oppress the Tibetan people forever. This is making them enemies of all the people of Tibet, and it will certainly not end well. Finally, he said to the listening masses that everyone can now live a peaceful life entirely thanks to the kindness of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Everyone will see more clearly who is protecting the people and who is harming the people.

After Lobsang Renchen finished speaking, warm applause erupted from the crowd. Zhasang, a Tibetan woman who recently came to Lhasa from Mozhugongka, also accused the rebels of their crimes of harming the people in the local area to the masses. The facts they revealed aroused great anger among the listening masses. Qiyou and Ciren Qujie, residents living under the Potala Palace, immediately expressed their willingness to actively assist the People's Liberation Army in wiping out the rebels.

    西藏叛匪是毫无人性的野兽
    布达拉宫喇嘛洛桑仁钦揭露叛乱分子残害人民的罪行
    新华社拉萨7日电　布达拉宫的一个喇嘛洛桑仁钦，4月5日下午在布达拉宫前向八百多名喇嘛和市民揭露了叛乱分子在拉萨北部彭波地区残害人民的罪行。
    洛桑仁钦是3月22日拂晓被盘踞在布达拉宫的叛匪裹胁到彭波地区的。他在彭波地区亲眼看到叛乱分子奸淫烧杀、残害人民的罪行后，冲破了叛乱分子的多方阻挠，于4月4日下午回到拉萨。
    洛桑仁钦向群众讲述了叛乱分子用欺骗、威胁手段裹胁他离开拉萨的经过。他说，3月22日拂晓，盘踞在布达拉宫的叛乱分子向彭波地区逃窜，并用枪逼着他一起逃跑。叛乱分子欺骗他说，如果不走，解放军来了会杀掉他。洛桑仁钦说，他在去彭波的路上，看见叛乱分子因分赃不均而互相残杀，几个叛匪把一个同伙杀死以后，把死者的衣服和鞋子都剥走了。
    洛桑仁钦揭露叛乱分子在彭波地区劫掠群众财物、残害人民的情况说，叛乱分子到了彭波地区以后，立即四处抢劫，他们把田里的耕牛打死了吃肉，把群众家里的财物全都抢光，把箱子、柜子等家具砸碎了当柴烧。在抢劫群众粮食的时候，叛匪们还把拿不走的粮食拉上大小便，不让群众吃。叛匪甚至强迫群众把身上穿的衣服脱下来抢走。洛桑仁钦说：“现在彭波地区很难看到牛和马，几乎所有的牲畜都被叛乱分子杀掉或抢走了。群众害怕叛匪烧杀抢掠，躲在山上不敢回来进行春耕播种。”
    洛桑仁钦愤怒地揭露了他亲眼看到的叛匪强奸尼姑、破坏宗教的罪行。当他路过彭波的噶丹群科寺附近时，一个藏族中年人正在送他的妹妹到寺里去，他妹妹是这个寺的尼姑。在路上十个叛乱分子堵住了他们的去路，灭绝人性地轮奸了这个尼姑，最后又把这个尼姑弄死了。强奸这个尼姑的匪徒中间有参加叛乱的喇嘛。洛桑仁钦说，他还看到另外一个怀了孕的女人也被叛匪轮奸死了。他愤怒地说：“这些打着‘保护宗教’旗子的叛匪，就是这样一群毫无人性的野兽。”
    洛桑仁钦说，过去他受了叛乱分子的欺骗，但叛匪的罪恶行为，使他看清了他们的真面目。他表示要坚决和全西藏的人民站在一起，积极协助人民解放军彻底平息叛乱。他还说，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动武装叛乱，妄图把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，让他们永远残害、压迫西藏人民，这是他们和全西藏的人民为敌，肯定不会有好结果的。他最后向听讲的群众说，现在大家能过和平的生活，完全是共产党、解放军的恩情。谁在保护人民，谁在残害人民，大家会看得更加清楚。
    洛桑仁钦讲完以后，群众中响起了热烈的掌声。不久前从墨竹工卡来到拉萨的藏族妇女扎桑，也向群众控诉了叛匪在当地残害人民的罪行。他们揭露的事实激起了听讲群众的极大愤怒。住在布达拉宫下的居民启由和慈仁曲杰，当场表示要积极协助人民解放军肃清叛乱分子。
