Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:
	I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Chairman Li Weihan's CPPCC Work Report, and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian's reports, and I guarantee their implementation.

	Now, I would like to make a speech on the issue of malaria prevention and control in Guizhou Province.

	Before liberation, Guizhou was a notorious "malaria zone." The so-called "miasma" was malaria. At that time, a folk song circulated among the masses: "In the eighth month when the millet turns yellow, 'malaria' forces you to bed, nine out of ten people are sick, and no one brings medicine." This fully expressed the long-term suffering of all ethnic groups from malaria, seriously affecting production and the desolate scene of life. Due to the rampant malaria, some places were destroyed, families were ruined, and fields were barren. In Qinglong County, a village called Yueliangtian had more than 2,000 people more than 30 years ago. Due to years of malaria attacks, the masses died of illness and fled, leaving only nine households at the time of liberation. In Guba Village, Guailiang Township, Kaiyang County, there were 113 households, but only a few people went to the fields to harvest rice every year when the rice matured, and the rest were unable to work due to malaria. In Luomo Township, Shuicheng County, before liberation, as many as 700 mu of farmland were abandoned due to the prevalence of malaria, which seriously affected agricultural production. According to statistics in the early days of liberation, malaria patients in the province accounted for more than 70% of the total number of patients with 13 infectious diseases. It is estimated that there were about 3 million people with malaria and malaria parasites.

	After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups widely launched patriotic health campaigns and vigorously carried out various disease prevention and control work, especially against the diseases that posed the greatest threat to people's health, and achieved great results. In recent years, the number of cases of various diseases has been greatly reduced: smallpox has been eradicated, and relapsing fever and typhus have been basically eliminated. Great efforts have also been made in the prevention and control of malaria. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1.24 million malaria patients have been treated, more than 3.89 million people have received anti-relapse treatment, and indoor drug spraying has been carried out over 157 million square meters. Forty-three counties and cities and many townships and communes in the province have basically eliminated malaria. The masses sang such a folk song: "When the sun comes out red, the Party cares most about the people; after the malaria prevention work is carried out, the root of all evil malaria has been cut off." This expresses gratitude to the Party for its greatest concern for the people's health.

	In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, the work of malaria prevention and control in Guizhou Province had a great leap forward. Combined with the in-depth development of the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, a new upsurge in eliminating malaria was set off throughout the province. The broad masses of cadres and people showed soaring revolutionary vigor and were determined to completely eradicate the root of malaria in a short period of time. Taking Lushan County, where the Miao people live, as an example, malaria was the most serious here before liberation. In the past few years since liberation, with the development of production and the development of mass health campaigns, various infectious diseases have been greatly reduced, but malaria still poses a serious threat to people's health. According to the results of a survey conducted by the Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in 1957, the average parasite rate was 11.2% and the average spleen swelling rate was 28.7%, which was considered to be a highly malaria-endemic area. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the Lushan County Party Committee put forward a plan to basically eliminate malaria within one year. After extensive and in-depth publicity among the masses, the malaria prevention work formed a vigorous mass movement. Combined with agricultural production, the people of all ethnic groups carried out work to dredge ditches, fill in depressions and sewage pits, improve environmental sanitation, and eliminate mosquito breeding places and overwintering mosquitoes; combined with the establishment of people's communes, the slogan of "three moves" was put forward—that is, moving toilets and establishing public toilets; moving pigsties out of houses; moving cattle pens to the slopes. Due to everyone's participation and family mobilization, the environmental sanitation in this county has been greatly improved. By the end of September 1958, the county had cleared more than 77,000 tons of garbage and weeds, dredged more than 750,000 zhang of ditches, filled in 24,000 sewage pits, and built 130,000 new pig and cattle pens. Universally improve environmental sanitation, kill mosquitoes; vigorously carry out malaria census and treatment; conscientiously implement the principle of combining science and technology with mass movement, comprehensively train anti-malaria cadres and non-detached health personnel, and hand over the basic knowledge and technology of malaria prevention and control to the masses, giving play to the wisdom of the masses. The malaria prevention and control work was carried out quickly and well, such as the county completed the malaria history census of 140,000 people in less than ten days; completed the spring anti-relapse treatment of more than 10,000 people in half a month, and so on. Therefore, the incidence of malaria in 1958 decreased from 9.44% in 1957 to 0.47%, which was a leap forward and a great achievement. Due to the reduction of diseases, the labor force was protected, which effectively promoted the development of agricultural production. We deeply realize that the reason why the malaria prevention and control work can achieve such great results and can have a huge leap forward in 1958 like other construction undertakings is due to the full mobilization of the masses and the large-scale mass movement under the leadership of the Party. Facts have proved that as long as the masses are mobilized, they will form an endless force, and the root of diseases that have been around for thousands of years can be completely eradicated.

	Under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and with the help of the Han elder brother, the more than 4 million minority people in our Guizhou Province have achieved brilliant achievements in industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings in the past few years. Whether in politics, economy, or culture, they are developing rapidly day by day. In the happy life after liberation, our Miao people deeply feel that the leadership of the Party, the unity of all ethnic groups, and the unity of the motherland are the fundamental source of prosperity, prosperity, and happiness. But just as the people of all ethnic groups across the country were striving with greater vigor on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 to complete a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than in 1958, the original Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary group, under the planning of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, openly launched an armed rebellion that betrayed the motherland and undermined the unity of the motherland and all ethnic groups. This monstrous criminal act is intolerable to the people of all ethnic groups across the country. The State Council's order to dissolve the original Tibetan local government and completely quell the Tibetan rebellion is completely correct, and I express my heartfelt support. Tibet is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory, which is universally recognized. However, after the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan traitors suffered a shameful defeat and fled to India, some foreign reactionaries and expansionists openly issued a shout of interference in China's internal affairs, and even expressed "sympathy and support" for the criminals of the Chinese people, and expressed "unease" at the shameful failure of this small group of reactionaries. Is this something that a country friendly to China can do? We want to solemnly warn these expansionists that China's internal affairs brook no interference, and the unity and unification of all ethnic groups in China must not be undermined. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, with the complete suppression of the rebellion, the Tibetan people will surely be able to join the people of all ethnic groups across the country in building a democratic, prosperous, and happy new Tibet on the broad road of socialism!

### 我国内政不容外国人干涉  张超伦委员（苗族）的发言

    我国内政不容外国人干涉
    张超伦委员（苗族）的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李维汉副主席的政协工作报告，和李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告，并保证贯彻执行。
    现在，我就贵州省防治疟疾方面的问题作一个发言。
    贵州在解放以前是一个有名的“瘴疠之区”，所谓“瘴气”就是疟疾。当时在群众中流传着一首民谣：“八月谷子黄，‘摆子’逼上床，十有九人病，无人送药汤”。这充分地道出了各族劳动人民长期身受疟疾的痛苦，严重影响生产和生活的凄凉景象。由于疟疾猖獗，致使有些地方家破人亡，田园荒芜。晴隆县的一个名叫月亮田的村庄，三十多年前有两千多人口，由于连年遭受疟疾的侵袭，群众病死逃荒，到解放时只剩下九户人家了。开阳县拐良乡谷坝村有一百一十三户人家，但每年稻谷成熟时，只有几个人下田收割，其余的人都因患疟疾不能出工。水城县倮摩乡在解放前，因疟疾流行而丢荒的田土即达七百多亩，严重的影响了农业生产。据解放初期的统计，全省疟疾病人，竟占十三种传染病患者总数的百分之七十以上。估计发病的人和带疟疾原虫者约在三百万人左右。
    解放以后，各族人民在党的领导下，广泛地开展了爱国卫生运动，大力进行各种疾病的防治工作，特别是对危害人民健康最大的疾病开展了顽强的斗争，取得了巨大的成绩。几年来各种疾病的发病人数大为减少：天花已经绝迹，回归热、斑疹伤寒已经基本上消除。疟疾的防治工作也作了极大的努力，据不完全的统计，几年来共治疗了疟疾病人一百二十四万多人，抗复发治疗三百八十九万余人，进行了室内药物喷洒灭蚊一亿五千七百多万平方公尺，全省已有四十三个县、市和许多乡、社基本上消灭了疟疾。群众唱着这样一首歌谣：“太阳出来红登登，党对人民最关心；抗疟工作开展后，万恶摆子断了根。”来表示感谢党对人民健康的最大关怀。
    大跃进的一九五八年，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，贵州省防治疟疾的工作有一个很大的跃进，结合以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的深入开展，全省掀起了一个消灭疟疾的新高潮。广大干部和群众表现了冲天的革命干劲，决心要在短期内彻底挖掉疟疾的病根。以苗族人民聚居的炉山县来说，解放前这里疟疾流行最为严重，解放几年来，随着生产的发展，群众卫生运动的开展，各种传染疾病大大减少了，但是疟疾对人民健康仍然存在着严重的威胁。一九五七年经中国医学科学院寄生虫病研究所调查的结果，平均原虫率为百分之十一点二，平均脾肿率为百分之二十八点七，认为还是一个高度疟疾流行区。在大跃进的一九五八年，炉山县委提出一年内基本消灭疟疾的计划，在群众中广泛深入地进行了宣传以后，抗疟工作形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。各族人民结合农业生产，进行了疏通沟渠，填平凹地、污水坑，改善环境卫生，消灭蚊蝇孳生处所和过冬蚊虫的工作；结合人民公社的建立提出“三搬家”的口号——即厕所搬家，建立公共厕所；猪圈搬出屋；牛圈迁上坡。由于人人动手，家家动员，这个县的环境卫生有了很大的改善，到一九五八年九月底全县共清除垃圾杂草七万七千多吨，疏通沟渠七十五万多丈，填平污水坑二万四千个，新建猪、牛圈一十三万个。普遍改善环境卫生，杀灭蚊虫；大力地进行了疟疾普查和治疗的工作；认真执行贯彻了科学技术与群众运动相结合的原则，普训抗疟干部和不脱产的卫生人员，把防治疟疾的基本知识和技术交给群众，发挥了群众的智慧，疟疾的防治工作开展得既快又好，如全县在不到十天的时间完成了十四万人口的疟史普查；半个月完成了万余人的春季抗复发治疗等等。因而，一九五八年疟疾的发病率由一九五七年的百分之九点四四降低到百分之零点四七，这是一个跃进，成绩是巨大的。由于疾病的减少，保护了劳动力，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。我们深深的体会到，疟疾的防治工作之所以能够取得这样大的成绩，能够和其他各项建设事业一样在一九五八年出现一个巨大的跃进，是由于在党的领导下充分发动了群众，大搞群众运动的结果。事实证明，只要群众一经发动起来，就会形成无穷无尽的力量，千百年来的疾病患根就可以彻底根除。
    我们贵州省的四百多万少数民族人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在汉族老大哥的帮助下，几年来在工农业生产和其他各项建设事业上都取得了辉煌成就，无论在政治、经济、文化各个方面都在日新月异的向前发展。我们苗族人民在解放后的幸福生活中深深感到：党的领导，各族人民的团结和祖国的统一，是繁荣、昌盛、幸福的根本源泉。但正当全国各族人民在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，以更大的干劲为完成比一九五八年更大更好更全面的跃进的时候，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的策划下，公然发动了背叛祖国、破坏祖国统一和各民族团结的武装叛乱，这种滔天的罪恶行为是我们全国各族人民所不能容忍的。国务院关于解散原西藏地方政府和彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令是完全正确的，我表示衷心的拥护。西藏是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，这是举世公认的。但是，西藏叛国分子所发动的武装叛乱遭到了可耻的失败而逃往印度以后，外国的某些反动分子和扩张主义分子，竟明目张胆地发出了一片干涉我国内政的叫嚷，竟然对中国人民的罪人表示“同情和支持”，对这一小撮反动分子的可耻失败表示“不安”，这难道是一个对中国友好的国家所能做的事情吗？我们要正告这些扩张主义分子们，中国人民的内政不容干涉的，中国各民族的团结和统一不容许破坏的。我们相信，西藏人民在中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，随着叛乱的彻底平息，一定能够和全国各民族人民一道，在社会主义的康庄大道上，建设起民主的、繁荣幸福的新西藏！
