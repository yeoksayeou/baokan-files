Several Questions on High-Yield and High-Quality Converter Steelmaking
Metallurgical Industry Department Iron and Steel Research Institute

This year, the proportion of converter steel production in the country's total steel output will increase many times over. Therefore, how to rapidly increase converter output has become an urgent problem to solve.

Current converter production has not yet fully mastered the technology, many operating techniques have not been fully mastered, and some systems have not yet been established. Therefore, in order to complete this year's steel production tasks and achieve high converter output, high quality, and high efficiency, we must seize the opportunity and quickly break through the technical barriers, which is the key to current converter production.

What aspects need to be addressed to improve converter technology?

Improve Converter Lining Life

The lifespan of the furnace lining is related to the success of converter production. To improve the lifespan of the converter, the following five tasks must be done:

Raw materials: The lining first requires dolomite with pure composition. Generally, its chemical composition should contain more than 17% magnesium oxide, fewer impurities, silicon dioxide less than 2%, and iron oxide and aluminum oxide less than 2%. Such dolomite can have good refractoriness and good slag resistance after sintering.

Second, prevent hydration. The characteristic of sintered dolomite is that it slowly absorbs moisture from the air. Dolomite bricks containing moisture will release moisture when heated, causing the bricks to crack and affecting the lining life. The method to prevent rehydration is to first thoroughly calcine the raw material (dolomite), and then pay attention to waterproofing in all aspects of the lining process, from raw materials, brickmaking, oil cooking, bricklaying, and furnace baking.

Brickmaking: The basic requirements for the quality of dolomite powder lining bricks are compactness and uniformity to achieve high mechanical strength of the bricks and resistance to erosion, ensuring very small brick seams. To improve the quality of the bricks, the particle size must be appropriately matched. In order to obtain brick tightness, there must be an appropriate combination of large, medium, and small particles to fill each other, reduce pores, and achieve maximum density. Large at both ends and small in the middle, that is, the ratio of large particles and fine powder should be large, and the ratio of medium particles should be small.

In addition, the material should be mixed well, and the molding should be uniform. And always check the brick mold to ensure accurate dimensions.

Bricklaying: When bricklaying, pay special attention to ensuring that the internal dimensions of the converter are accurate, and the brick seams should be as small as possible. Large seams are easily damaged. In addition, pay attention to waterproofing. It is best to lay dry as much as possible. When water must be used to build the tuyere, only use bittern magnesia sand, and the bittern specific gravity must be above 1.3.

Furnace Baking: The task of furnace baking is twofold: one is to sinter the bricks, and the other is to increase the temperature of the furnace lining itself to meet the needs of smelting. Therefore, the quality of furnace baking is directly related to the life of the furnace lining. To bake the furnace well, it is necessary to quickly increase the temperature and bake the tuyeres more. The baking time must be sufficient, and the temperature must generally reach above 1400 degrees.

Operation and maintenance: Converter blowing operation has a great impact on the life of the furnace. The correct blowing system is surface blowing, which is best for furnace lining maintenance. Deep blowing, negative angle blowing, and hanging blowing will aggravate the erosion of the furnace lining and should be avoided. To prevent damage to the furnace lining, after-blowing should also be avoided.

Ensure Normal Operation of Cupola

The cupola furnace in the converter workshop supplies high-temperature molten iron to the converter. In the current situation where the sulfur content of pig iron is high, whether the cupola furnace can meet the needs of the converter is a basic link for high output, high quality, and high efficiency in the converter workshop. It is inappropriate to regard the cupola furnace as a simple melting equipment. It must be raised to a status equal to that of the converter and given full attention. The current problems in cupola furnace operation are: first, the temperature of molten iron is low; second, the composition fluctuates greatly, causing abnormal converter operation and unstable steel quality; third, the furnace lining life is short; and fourth, the melting rate is low, hindering the converter from carrying out rhythmic production.

In order to overcome these problems and improve cupola furnace production, it is necessary to focus on the following four issues:

Strengthen Raw Material Management: Good raw material management is the primary condition for ensuring the good operation of the cupola furnace. It is required to stack different raw materials (pig iron, coke, limestone, etc.) according to different origins and different composition grades (pig iron can also be classified according to fracture). The size and uniformity of the raw materials added to the cupola furnace affect the temperature of the molten iron and need to be appropriately crushed. Classify the sizes and keep the input uniform. For coke, the quality should be particularly emphasized now, requiring the ash content and sulfur content to be no worse than that of the coke used in blast furnaces.

Improve Operating Technology: The main point is appropriate batching. The purpose of batching is to combine different raw materials into the molten iron composition required by the converter. Currently, batching mainly considers silicon addition and desulfurization. Silicon addition should also be determined according to the temperature of the molten iron. If the temperature of the molten iron is high, the silicon can be lower. In addition, whether to use hot air and the level of hot air temperature, as well as the size of the converter capacity and the level of operation, need to be considered to determine the level of silicon addition. The general principle is to ensure that the converter has sufficient heat while minimizing the silicon content of the molten iron, preferably not exceeding 1.3% to 1.6%. Secondly, the material should be evenly distributed. After pig iron and coke are charged into the furnace, they must be spread evenly to prevent pig iron from accumulating on one side of the furnace and coke on the other, affecting the temperature of the molten iron and the melting rate. Control the stock line. The fluctuation of the stock line should not be too large. The range of stock line height fluctuation should be specified according to the size of the furnace. Too much fluctuation will also reduce the temperature of the molten iron. Maintain a certain coke layer thickness for each batch of material. A thickness of 150 to 200 mm is generally suitable. The bottom coke should maintain a certain height. Too low will reduce the temperature of the molten iron, and too high will affect the melting speed. It should be determined according to the actual operating conditions of each furnace.

Use Hot Air: This is a new technology with significant meaning that deserves to be widely promoted. It helps to increase the temperature of the molten iron and is also very beneficial for desulfurization and improving the quality of the molten iron in the cupola furnace. The use of hot air can also reduce the coke ratio and increase the melting rate.

Regarding the form of the hot air furnace, the currently used ones include serpentine tube type and needle type hot air furnaces. Tube type hot air furnaces have a simple structure but occupy a large area and often have air leakage. Measures must be taken to prevent air leakage. Needle type hot air furnaces have difficulty cleaning ash, which affects maintaining high air temperature. Measures must also be taken to clean the ash.

Use Alkaline Hot Air Cupola Furnace: For pig iron with a sulfur content of more than 0.3%, alkaline hot air operation must be adopted to perform in-furnace desulfurization.

Improve Side-Blown Alkaline Converter Operation

To achieve high output, high quality, and high efficiency in converter production, two main conditions must first be met: one is good temperature and the other is good reaction. The so-called good temperature means that the metal and slag can always maintain good fluidity and sufficient temperature during the blowing process. The so-called good reaction means that the chemical reactions of dephosphorization, desulfurization, and carbon reduction proceed quickly and well during the blowing process. All converter operations must serve to create these two conditions, and the following points are proposed in this regard:

High-Temperature Blowing: Converter production has no external heat source and relies entirely on the physical heat and chemical heat of the molten iron itself for blowing. In the current situation where the chemical heat in pig iron is not rich enough, on the one hand, the temperature of the molten iron should be increased as much as possible, and on the other hand, the operation should be done as quickly as possible to minimize the loss of physical heat. Therefore, the closest coordination between each process is required, avoiding delays in time between each process. The converter should be immediately charged with molten iron after tapping to prevent the converter lining temperature from dropping, and the cupola furnace should therefore cooperate well. Attention should also be paid to preparing the iron-tapping crane and heated molten iron ladle for the cupola furnace. The time from iron-tapping from the cupola furnace to injection into the converter should not exceed ten minutes at most. All measures should also be taken in the converter blowing operation to shorten the time and increase the temperature. The operation method of continuously adding ferrosilicon and aluminum during the blowing process to increase the steel temperature is not good. This not only increases the consumption of raw materials and increases the cost of steel, but also affects the life of the furnace lining, which is detrimental to production. Therefore, the use of aluminum to increase the temperature should be prohibited, and ferrosilicon should only be allowed to increase the temperature in special circumstances.

Reasonable Blowing System: The converter's reasonable blowing system is to ensure sufficient tapping temperature and a suitable chemical composition of the steel, and also to protect the furnace lining from severe erosion. There are two main links that constitute a reasonable blowing system: one is the correct blowing angle, and the other is the appropriate blowing depth. As long as these two links are grasped, the oxygen in the air blown into the converter can be fully utilized, so that fast reaction speed, short blowing time, high steel temperature, low metal consumption, and long furnace lining life can be obtained.

Ensure Steel Quality: The main problem currently affecting the quality of converter steel is desulfurization. High sulfur is the most prominent problem in current quality. The basic reason is the high sulfur content of pig iron. The solution is to first control the sulfur content of the molten iron entering the converter to a maximum of 0.2% (pig iron exceeding 0.2% should be desulfurized in the cupola furnace to below the specified level, and pig iron with a sulfur content greater than 0.5% should be returned to the blast furnace as described above). The slag retention method can be used for converter desulfurization. The experience of Shanghai and Tangshan can desulfurize by more than 50%-60%, so the sulfur quality problem of steel can be completely solved. The slag retention method requires a suitable slag basicity (which is also the basic key to all slag-making systems). The basicity should not be too high, which is convenient for the slag to melt early and create conditions for desulfurization and dephosphorization. The slag basicity should be around 3 when tapping steel and 1 to 1.5 when removing slag.

For deoxidation, the main requirement is to correctly control the blowing endpoint and avoid after-blowing. The carbon content at the endpoint is required to be above 0.08% (low carbon steel), and the minimum shall not be less than 0.06%. Another important measure related to deoxidation is the use of small steel tapping spouts, which is worth promoting. Small steel tapping spouts can prevent steel slag from being discharged at the same time as molten steel, avoid the deoxidizer from being bound by the slag and oxidized, which not only greatly weakens the deoxidation effect, but also has the risk of phosphorus reversion, which is harmful to the quality of the steel.

Currently, the steel temperature is often too low, so that the steel ingots cannot be cast, becoming semi-ingot waste, or affecting the surface quality of the steel ingots. Therefore, a suitable high temperature is required.

Improve Organization and Strengthen Management

First, the converter workshop must have a strict work plan. The workshop leaders should track the completion of production daily and hourly, organize work and check work according to the work plan, so that weak links can be discovered and adjusted in time to avoid uncoordinated work. Second, implement the technical operating regulations.

Raw material management is a prerequisite for normal production. The main task of doing this work is to establish a management system and responsibility system. Each factory should have a chemical analysis laboratory to perform the necessary analysis and testing of raw materials and products. Correct measurement is also necessary. The workshop should have equipment for weighing raw materials, molten iron, etc.

It is also necessary to establish a certain original record system to make the necessary records of raw materials, cupola furnaces, converters, and ingots. This is beneficial for summarizing advanced production experience and checking and analyzing production defects. It is recommended that all factories promote this system.

    关于转炉高产优质的几个问题
    冶金工业部钢铁研究院
    今年，在全国钢产量中，转炉生产所占的比重将增加好多倍。因此，如何迅速提高转炉产量，这就成为当前迫切需要解决的问题了。
    当前的转炉生产还没有过好技术关，许多操作技术还没有完全掌握，有些制度还没有建立。因此，为了完成今年钢的生产任务，达到转炉高产、优质、高效率，必须抓住时机，迅速突破技术关，这是目前转炉生产的关键。
    转炉过好技术关，需要抓哪几个方面的问题呢？
    提高转炉炉衬寿命
    炉衬寿命的长短，关系转炉生产的好坏。过好转炉寿命关，有下列五项工作要做：
    原料：炉衬首先要求用成分纯的白云石，一般规定其化学成分含氧化镁在17％以上，含杂质要少，二氧化矽要小于2％，氧化铁和氧化铝也要小于2％。这样的白云石经烧结后可以有很好的耐火度和良好的抗渣浸性能。
    其次要防止水化。烧结白云石的特性，是会慢慢地吸收空气中的水分。而含有水分的白云石砖，一旦受热，就会放出水分引起砖的开裂，影响炉衬寿命。防止水返潮化的办法，首先是把生料（白云石）烧透，其次在整个制炉衬的过程中，从原料、打砖、熬油、砌砖和烘炉等各个方面都要注意防水。
    制砖：对白云石粉衬砖质量的基本要求，就是紧密、均匀，以达到砖的机械强度大，而又耐冲刷，保证砖缝很小。要提高砖的质量，就需要将颗粒配合适当。为了求得砖的紧密，须要有大、中、小颗粒适当的配合，以互相充填，减少孔隙，达到最大的密度。两头大中间小，即大颗粒和细粉的比例要大，中颗粒比例要小。
    另外料要拌好，成型要求均匀。并且经常检查砖模，保证尺寸准确。
    砌炉：砌炉特别要注意转炉内型尺寸要砌得准，砖缝要尽量小。缝一大就容易损坏。此外还要注意防水，最好尽可能干砌，砌风眼不得已用水时，也只用卤水镁砂砌，并且要求卤水比重在一点三以上。
    烘炉：烘炉的任务有二，一是烧结砖的作用，二是提高炉衬本身温度，达到冶炼的需要。因此烘炉的好坏直接关系着炉衬的寿命。炉子要烘的好，要快速升温，要多烤风眼。烤的时间要足，温度一般要达到一千四百度以上。
    操作维护：转炉吹炼操作对炉子寿命有很大的影响，正确的吹炼制度是面吹，对炉衬维护最好。而深吹，负角度吹以及吊吹都会加剧炉衬的侵蚀，是应当避免的。为了防止损坏炉衬，还应该避免后吹。
    保证化铁炉正常操作
    转炉车间的化铁炉是以高温铁水供给转炉的。在目前生铁含硫较高的情况下，化铁炉能否满足转炉的需要，是转炉车间高产、优质、高效率的基本环节。把化铁炉看成简单的熔化设备，是不合适的，必须把它提高到与转炉平起平坐的地位，给以充分注意。目前化铁炉操作上存在的问题一是铁水温度低；其次成分波动大，致使转炉操作不正常，钢的质量不稳定，三是炉衬寿命短；四是熔化率低，妨碍了转炉进行有节奏的生产。
    为了克服以上这些问题，搞好化铁炉生产，要抓下面四个问题：
    加强原料管理：原料管理好是保证化铁炉工作良好的首要条件，要求将不同原料（生铁、焦炭、石灰石等）按不同产地，不同成分等级（生铁也可以按断口）分别堆放。加入化铁炉原料块度的大小和是否均匀对铁水温度有影响，也需要进行适当破碎。块度分级，保持均匀入炉。对于焦炭现在特别应当强调质量，要求灰分和含硫量不差于高炉用的焦炭。
    改进操作技术：主要是配料适宜，配料的目的是为了将不同的原料配成转炉所要求的铁水成分。目前配料主要考虑配矽脱硫。配矽还要根据铁水温度来确定，铁水温度高，矽可以低些。除此，是否采用热风及其风温的高低，以及转炉容量大小和操作水平等因素就需要考虑来确定配矽的高低，一般原则是保证转炉足够热量的条件下，尽可能使铁水含矽量低些，以不超过1.3％至1.6％为宜。其次布料要均匀。生铁和焦炭等入炉后，必须铺得均匀，防止生铁堆积在炉子一面，而焦又在另一面，影响铁水温度和熔化率。控制料线。料线波动不应过大，根据炉子的大小应分别订出料线高度波动范围，波动过大也会使铁水温度降低。每批料层保持一定焦层厚度。一般以一百五十至二百公厘厚度合宜。底焦要保持一定的高度，过低会降低铁水温度，过高又要影响熔化速度，应根据各个炉子实际操作情况来确定。
    采用热风：这是值得普遍推广的有重大意义的新技术，有助于提高铁水温度，也对于化铁炉脱硫和提高铁水质量有很大好处。采用热风也可以降低焦比，提高熔化率。
    关于热风炉形式的问题，目前采用的有蛇形管式、针状式等热风炉。管式热风炉构造简单但占用面积较大，常有漏风现象，须采取措施防止漏风；针状式热风炉对于清灰较困难，影响经常保持高风温，也须采取措施进行清灰。
    采用碱性热风化铁炉：对于含硫量在0.3％以上的生铁，一定要采用碱性热风操作，进行炉内脱硫。
  改进侧吹碱性转炉操作
    转炉生产要达到高产、优质、高效率，首先必须具备两个最主要的条件：一是温度好和反应好。所谓温度好，就是在吹炼过程中使金属和渣子能经常保持着良好的流动性和足够的温度。所谓反应好，就是在吹炼过程中去磷、去硫、降炭的化学反应进行得又快又好。一切转炉操作都必须为创造这两个条件而为此服务，这方面提出以下几点：
    高温吹炼：转炉生产没有外来的热源，完全依靠铁水本身的物理热和化学热进行吹炼，在目前生铁中的化学热不够丰富的情况下，一方面要尽量提高铁水温度，另一方面操作时更应该做到分秒必争，尽量减少物理热量的损失。因此除化铁炉供给尽可能高温的铁水外，必须要求各个工段间的最密切衔接配合，避免每个工序间时间上的耽搁。转炉出钢后应立即加入铁水以防转炉炉衬温度下降，化铁炉因此要很好配合。也要注意对化铁炉的出铁吊车和烘热的铁水罐作好准备，要求化铁炉出铁后到注入转炉止时间最多不得超过十分钟，对于转炉吹炼操作也要采取一切措施以缩短时间和提高温度。在吹炼过程中不断加入矽铁和铝以提高钢水温度的操作方法是不好的，这不但增加了原料的消耗，提高了钢的成本，同时还会影响炉衬的寿命，对生产是不利的，因此应当禁止使用铝提温，并只有在特殊情况下才允许用矽铁提温。
    合理的吹炼制度：转炉合理的吹炼制度是为了保证有足够的出钢温度和合宜的钢的化学成分，另外也为了保护炉衬使其不遭受严重的侵蚀。构成合理的吹炼制度有两个主要环节，一个是正确的吹炼角度，另一个是合适的吹炼深度。只要抓住这两个环节就可以使鼓入转炉里的空气中的氧气得到充分利用，这样就能获得反应速度快，吹炼时间短，钢水温度高，金属消耗少以及炉衬寿命长等效果。
    保证钢的质量：当前影响转炉钢质量的主要问题是脱硫问题。硫高是当前质量最突出的问题，基本原因是生铁硫高，解决办法是首先控制进转炉的铁水含硫量最大不得超过0.2％
  （超过0.2％的生铁应在化铁炉脱硫到规定以下，大于0.5％含硫生铁如上面所述在高炉中回炉）。转炉脱硫操作可以采用留渣法，上海和唐山的经验可以脱硫50％—60％以上，因此完全可以解决钢的含硫质量问题。留渣法要求有适宜的渣碱度（这也是所有造渣制度的基本关键）。碱度不宜太高，便于渣料提早熔化，为脱硫和脱磷创造条件，出钢时渣碱度以三左右为宜，扒渣碱度以一至一点五为宜。
    对于脱氧，主要要求正确控制吹炼终点，避免后吹，终点含炭量要求在0.08％以上（低炭钢），最低不得小于0.06％。与脱氧有关的另一重要措施是采用小出钢口，值得推广。小出钢口可以防止钢渣与钢水同时倾出，避免脱氧剂给渣结住被渣氧化，不但脱氧效力大大减弱，而且有回磷的危险，对钢的质量是有损害的。
    目前钢水温度往往过低，以致钢锭浇不起来，成为半截锭的废品，或者影响钢锭表面质量不好，因此要有适当的高温。
      健全组织加强管理
    首先，转炉车间必须有严密的作业计划，车间领导应该按日按时抓生产完成情况，按作业计划组织工作和检查工作，这样就可以及时发现薄弱环节，予以调整，避免工作的不协调。其次，是贯彻执行技术操作规程。
    原料管理是生产正常的先决条件，作好这一工作主要是建立管理制度和责任制。各厂要有化学分析室，以便对原料和产品进行必要的分析检验。正确的计量也是必要的，车间要有对原料、铁水等过秤的设备。
    还必须建立一定的原始纪录制度，对原料、化铁炉、转炉、铸锭进行必要的纪录。这对于总结先进生产经验，以及检查分析生产缺陷，是有好处的，建议各厂推广这项制度。
