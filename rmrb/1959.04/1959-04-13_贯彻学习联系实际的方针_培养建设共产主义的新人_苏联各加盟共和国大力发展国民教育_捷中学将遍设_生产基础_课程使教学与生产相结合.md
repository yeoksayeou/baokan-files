    Our Correspondent in Moscow, April 12th - The Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Republics are currently holding meetings to discuss the implementation of national education reforms in their respective republics and have passed laws reforming national education in the republics.

    Latvia, the Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan, and the Transcaucasian republic of Azerbaijan have all undertaken this work. Ukraine also recently convened a conference of educators, focusing on various issues in the ongoing education reform.

    At the Supreme Soviet meetings of the republics, representatives first summarized the achievements of national education development in their respective ethnic groups. For example, in Kazakhstan, the total number of primary and secondary school students before the revolution was only 302, while now it has reached more than 1.5 million. Before the revolution, Kazakhstan had no institutions of higher learning, but now it has 27 universities and colleges with 65,000 students, which is more than twice the number of university students in Turkey, even though Kazakhstan's population is half that of Turkey. The number of schools in Uzbekistan is currently 38 times higher than in 1914, and the number of students has increased 75 times. In Azerbaijan, the current number of schools is 20 times that of the pre-revolutionary period, and the number of female students is more than 70 times higher.

    At the Supreme Soviet meetings of the republics, representatives all agreed that as the Soviet Union has entered a new period of communist construction, the task of national education is to cultivate new people for communism. Therefore, the policy of linking learning with practice must be implemented in all schools, and labor education for young people must be strengthened.

    All the republics have decided to divide national education into two stages. The first stage is eight years of compulsory education, and the second stage is three years of secondary education, which can be obtained through evening schools, correspondence courses, and other methods. The republics have also decided to continue the study of three languages ​​in the eight-year schools: the national language, Russian, and a foreign language. Because there are more language courses, other courses can be appropriately streamlined, and some courses focus on the second stage.

    While education reform is progressing smoothly, the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education recently passed three new regulations for university admissions. The 1959 general regulations for university admissions state that all applicants to universities this year should have evaluations from factories, enterprises, and Party, League, and trade union organizations. High school graduates should also have evaluations from their schools. Only those who have been engaged in practical work for two years can apply to the law, philosophy, journalism, and political economy departments of comprehensive universities. This year, certain preferential treatment will be given in university entrance examinations to those with practical work experience, war veterans, or demobilized soldiers. The enrollment regulations for correspondence and evening universities state that correspondence education and evening universities should be geared towards young people engaged in various professions. For example, evening schools and correspondence schools of medicine will specifically recruit young men and women engaged in medical work, and applicants in other majors should also have some connection to a certain profession. All those applying for correspondence or evening universities should also have evaluations from social organizations.

    Xinhua News Agency reports that, based on the recommendations of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education and Culture, starting from September 1st of this year, more than 400 eleven-year schools in Czechoslovakia will universally establish "production basis" courses to implement the policy of integrating teaching with production. By 1961, all eleven-year schools in various places will be converted to twelve-year schools.

    Not long ago, fifteen twelve-year experimental middle schools in Czechoslovakia summarized the experience of piloting the integration of teaching with production since last year. These experiences fully demonstrate the correctness of the communist education principle of combining theory with practice.

    The summary report shows that students demonstrate great enthusiasm and interest in labor, and thus quickly master production skills. Tenth-grade students at the Strakonice twelve-year school have been able to directly participate in production after a period of internship in the factory's apprentice workshop. The students' labor results are all good. Students at the fourteenth district twelve-year middle school in Prague participated in the district's housing construction work, and their labor efficiency is equivalent to 30% to 80% of the workers' quota. A class of students at the Prerov twelve-year school worked on a state-owned farm and completed a labor quota of 2,400 crowns.

  The summary also showed that participation in labor and contact with workers and farmers had a positive impact on the students' thoughts and feelings. Their realm of life expanded, and their practical knowledge increased. They learned from production practice the greatness and difficulty of labor, thereby cultivating their habits of enduring hardship and working hard. The number of students choosing industrial and agricultural production as their future professions has greatly increased compared to the past. The perseverance required for labor has also greatly changed the students' attitude toward learning, and students generally study harder than in the past.

    本报莫斯科12日电　苏联各加盟共和国目前正在召开最高苏维埃会议，讨论在共和国里贯彻国民教育改革的问题，并且通过了共和国改革国民教育的法令。
    拉脱维亚共和国和中亚西亚的乌兹别克、塔吉克、哈萨克等共和国和外高加索的阿塞拜疆共和国都进行了这一工作。乌克兰不久前也召开了教育工作者会议，着重研究了教育改革进行中的各项问题。
    在各加盟共和国的最高苏维埃会议上，代表们首先总结了各民族国民教育发展的成绩，例如哈萨克斯坦在革命前中小学学生的人数一共只有三百零二人，而现在却达到一百五十多万。在革命前哈萨克斯坦没有高等学校，现在已有二十七所高等学校，学生人数达六万五千人，比土耳其高等学校学生人数多一倍，但是，哈萨克斯坦的人口却比土耳其少一半。乌兹别克目前学校的数目比1914年增加了三十八倍，就学人数增加了七十五倍。阿塞拜疆，目前学校的数目等于革命前的二十倍，而女学生的数目等于革命前的七十倍以上。
    在各加盟共和国最高苏维埃会议上，代表们都认为，在苏联已经进入共产主义建设新时期的时候，国民教育的任务就是要培养共产主义的新人，因此要在所有的学校贯彻学习联系实际的方针，对青年加强劳动教育。
    各加盟共和国都决定把国民教育分成两个阶段，第一阶段是八年制义务教育，第二阶段是三年中学教育，这三年的教育可以通过夜校、函授等方式取得。各共和国还决定在八年制学校里继续三种语言课的学习，即民族语言、俄语和一种外国语，因为语言课程较多，所以其他课程可以适当精简，有一些课程把重点放在第二阶段。
    在教育改革顺利进行的时候，苏联高等教育部最近通过了三项高等学校入学的新条例。在1959年一般高等学校招生条例中指出，今年报考大学的人都应当有工厂、企业和党、团、工会组织的鉴定，如果是中学毕业生也应有学校的鉴定。综合性大学的法律、哲学、新闻和政经等系只有从事实际工作两年的人才能报考。今年大学入学考试中，对于有实际工作经验和参加过战争的人或退伍军人将有一定优待。在函授和夜大学的招生条例中指出，函授教育和夜大学要面向从事各专业的青年。例如，医学院的夜校和函授学校将专门招收从事医务工作的男女青年，其他各专业的报考者也应当对某一专业有一定的联系。凡是报考函授或夜大学的人，也应有社会组织的鉴定。
    据新华社讯　根据捷克斯洛伐克教育和文化部的建议，从今年9月1日起，捷克斯洛伐克四百多所十一年制的学校将普遍设立“生产基础”课程，实行教学与生产相结合的方针。到1961年时，各地所有十一年制学校都将改为十二年制。
    不久以前，捷克斯洛伐克的十五所十二年制实验中学总结了从去年以来试行教学与生产相结合的经验，这些经验充分证明了理论与实践相结合的共产主义教育原则的正确性。
    总结情况说明，学生们在劳动中表现出极大的热情和兴趣，因而很快地掌握了生产的技能。斯特拉科尼策十二年制学校十年级的学生在工厂的学徒车间进行了一段时期实习后，已能直接参加生产。学生们的劳动成绩都是良好的。布拉格第十四区十二年制中学的学生参加了这一区的房屋建筑工作，他们的劳动效率已相当于工人定额的30％到80％。普雷罗夫十二年制学校一个班的学生在国营农场劳动，完成了二千四百克朗的劳动定额。
  总结情况还表明，参加劳动以及同工人、农民的接触对学生们的思想感情产生了良好的影响。他们的生活领域扩大了，实际知识增多了。他们从生产实践中了解到劳动的伟大和艰巨，从而培养了他们吃苦耐劳的习惯。 选择工农业生产作为自己将来职业的学生比过去大大增多。劳动所需要的毅力也大大改变了学生们对待学习的态度，学生们普遍比过去学习得更努力了。
