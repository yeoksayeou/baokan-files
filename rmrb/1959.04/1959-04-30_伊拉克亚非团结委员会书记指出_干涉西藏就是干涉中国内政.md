Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 27th: Kassem Hassan, secretary of the Iraqi Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, who recently returned from attending the Indian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee meeting in Calcutta, told Xinhua reporters today that any interference in the situation in Tibet by any party "is interference in China's internal affairs and should be condemned and protested."

He said, "There is not a single knowledgeable and clear-headed person in the world who can deny the historical fact that the relationship between Tibet and China is like the relationship between a finger and a hand."

Kassem Hassan said that the incitement carried out by imperialists and Indian expansionists in Tibet is merely the nature of imperialists and expansionists who have consistently opposed the progress and development of the people.

Kassem Hassan said that the Tibetan rebellion within China, which has been defeated by the Chinese people, "is only one of the conspiracies planned by imperialism against the people who have already been liberated." He said: "The primary task of the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement is to strengthen the strength of their ranks and expose the various conspiracies carried out by imperialism against them, and resolutely implement the Bandung Principles, peaceful coexistence, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries."

    伊拉克亚非团结委员会书记指出
    干涉西藏就是干涉中国内政
    新华社巴格达27日电　最近到加尔各答参加印度亚非团结委员会会议后归来的伊拉克亚非团结委员会书记卡西姆·哈桑今天对新华社记者发表谈话说，任何方面对西藏局势的干涉，“都是对中国内政的干涉，应当受到谴责和抗议”。
    他说，“世界上没有一个有知识和头脑清醒的人能够否认这样的历史事实，即西藏同中国的关系就像手指头同手的关系一样。”
    卡西姆·哈桑说，帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子在西藏进行的煽动，只不过是一贯反对人民的进步和发展的帝国主义者和扩张主义分子的本性罢了。
    卡西姆·哈桑说，已经被中国人民击败的中国国内的西藏叛乱，“只不过是帝国主义对已经解放了的人民策划的阴谋之一而已。”他说：“亚非人民之间的团结运动的首要任务是加强他们队伍的力量和揭露帝国主义对他们进行的各种阴谋活动，并且坚决执行万隆原则、和平共处和不干涉各国人民的内政。”
