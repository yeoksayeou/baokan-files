　　Nanjing Yuejin Steel Plant Sums Up Small Blast Furnace Operation and Management Experience
　　Establishing Systems and Regulations for Monthly High Production and High Quality
    (Our Newspaper) News: Nanjing Yuejin Steel Plant, focusing on the goals of high production, high quality, and low cost, has gradually formulated a set of production and technical management systems, which have led to a step-by-step increase in the output and quality of small blast furnaces, and a month-by-month decrease in coke ratio and costs.

    Yuejin Steel Plant currently has four 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces. The daily output had long been stagnant at the level of twelve or thirteen tons. In the high-production and high-quality red flag competition, they deeply realized that uniform composition and qualified size of raw materials are important conditions for ensuring high production and high quality of pig iron. Therefore, they formulated a series of raw material management systems in production. For example, ore must be screened three times and charged into the furnace in two grades to ensure uniform ore composition. Magnetite and high-sulfur iron ore must be roasted before use, and ore without a test report is not allowed to enter the furnace. The blast furnace batching calculation is determined by the workshop director or the on-duty furnace chief and reported to the factory director for approval; based on the moisture, ash content, strength, and sulfur content of the coke, the amount of coke, ore, and limestone charged into the furnace and the charging sequence are determined. Due to the establishment of these systems, the furnace conditions are stable, and both output and quality have been significantly improved.

    Increasing the air volume and raising the air temperature are important measures for high quality and high production of small blast furnaces. The factory's leaders went deep into the furnace front and studied and experimented with the workers. They coated the surface of the red bricks in the hot blast stove with a layer of refractory mud, so that the temperature resistance reached above 900 degrees Celsius. Due to the success of this experiment, they boldly increased the air temperature, which is now generally around 500 degrees, and the highest reaching 600 degrees. They increased the motor pulley, and the blower speed increased from 560 revolutions per minute to 710 revolutions per minute, and the air pressure also increased to more than 180 mm of mercury column. Now these measures have been incorporated into the small blast furnace operating procedures, and the daily output of each blast furnace has generally increased by one or two tons. In addition, they have also established a production record system, an approval system, and various consumption quotas, such as stipulating that each ton of pig iron consumes 2.5 tons of ore and 1 ton of coke. The factory also established a maintenance team to periodically inspect and maintain the blast furnace. Due to the establishment of these production management systems, waste has been greatly reduced, and costs have decreased month by month. The cost of pig iron per ton in March decreased by 8% compared with January.

    In order to strengthen production leadership and technical management, the factory has established functional departments such as production and capital construction; each blast furnace and production unit has a furnace chief, foreman, and team leader, and defined the scope of responsibilities.

    This set of management systems is actually a summary of the experience of all factory employees in operation and management over the past six months. Therefore, it is fully in line with the technical level of the workers and the characteristics of each blast furnace, and all factory employees can consciously and strictly abide by it.

    With the improvement of management level and operating technical level, production is also gradually rising on a stable basis. In January, the average daily output of each blast furnace was 13.86 tons, and the coke ratio was 1.39. In February, the daily output increased to 15.77 tons, and the coke ratio was 1.22. In March, the average daily output increased to 16 tons, and the coke ratio decreased to 0.99. The quality of pig iron was all qualified. The factory won the Jiangsu Province's ironmaking victory red flag in the first quarter of this year.

　　南京跃进钢铁厂总结小高炉操作管理经验
　　订制度立规章月月高产高质
    本报讯　南京跃进钢铁厂围绕着高产优质低成本的目标，逐步制订了一套生产、技术管理制度，使小高炉产量、质量步步上升，焦比、成本逐月下降。
    跃进钢铁厂现有十三立方公尺高炉四座。日产量长期停在十二、三吨的水平。在高产优质红旗竞赛中，他们深深地体会到，原材料成分均匀、块度合格，是保证生铁高产优质的重要条件。因此，他们在生产中制订了一系列管理原料的制度。例如：矿石必须经过三道分筛，分两级入炉，保证矿石成分均匀。磁铁矿、高硫铁矿必须经过焙烧然后使用，没有化验单的矿石不准入炉。高炉的配料计算由车间主任或值班炉长决定，并报告厂长批准；根据焦炭的水分、灰分、强度、含硫量，确定焦炭、矿石、石灰石的入炉数量和装料顺序。由于这些制度的建立，炉况稳定，产量和质量都有显著提高。
    鼓足风量，提高风温，是小高炉优质高产的一项重要措施。这个厂的领导干部深入炉前，和工人一起研究试验，在热风炉内的红砖表面涂了一层耐火泥，使耐温程度达到摄氏九百度以上。由于这一试验成功，便大胆提高风温，现在风温一般都在五百度左右，最高达到六百度。他们把马达皮带盘加大，鼓风机转速每分钟由五百六十转增加到七百一十转，风压也提高到一百八十公厘水银柱以上。现在这些措施已编入小高炉操作规程，每座高炉的日产量一般都提高一、二吨。此外，他们还建立了生产记录制度、审批制度和各种消耗定额，如规定每一吨生铁耗用矿石二点五吨，焦炭一吨。厂内还建立了一个保全班，定期对高炉进行检修和维护工作。由于建立了这些生产管理制度，浪费现象大大减少，成本逐月下降。3月份每吨生铁成本比1月份降低了8％。
    为了加强生产领导和技术管理，厂内设立了生产基建等职能部门；每座高炉、生产单位都有炉长、工长、组长，并划分了职责范围。
    这一套管理制度，实际上是全厂职工半年来操作和管理方面的经验总结。因此，它完全符合工人的技术水平和各个高炉的特性，全厂职工都能自觉地严格地遵守。
    随着管理水平和操作技术水平的提高，生产也在稳定的基础上逐步上升。1月份每座高炉平均日产量为十三点八六吨，焦比为一点三九，2月份日产量上升为十五点七七吨，焦比为一点二二，3月份平均日产量又提高到十六吨，焦比下降到零点九九。生铁质量全部合格。这个厂今年第一季度获得了江苏省的炼铁优胜红旗。
