People's Daily, Chengdu, April 16th (Reporter Wang Huandou) To strengthen leadership over large-scale, high-yield fields, Fushun County, Sichuan, has recently established many large-scale, high-yield "command zones."

During an investigation and visit, Yu Jiajun, the First Secretary of the Fushun County Party Committee, was told by an old farmer: "The experimental plots cultivated by the cadres are small, while we are working on large plots. Some of the difficulties encountered on the large plots may not be encountered on the small experimental plots..." These words enlightened Yu Jiajun, and he decided to personally manage a large-scale, high-yield "command zone" in order to use the problems discovered and the experiences summarized in the production of large-scale, high-yield fields to guide the production of general fields in a timely manner.

The reporter recently visited the high-yield "command zone" of the Republican Commune led by Comrade Yu Jiajun. This "command zone" includes two management areas and part of the fields of the nearby farm and the Agricultural Red and Expert School. The participants include the heads of the county party committee, the commune, the farm, and the Red and Expert School, as well as production team leaders, commune members, and technicians. The "command zone" first mobilized the masses to propose specific measures to increase production for various crops on the 2,000 mu of high-yield fields, and also made detailed arrangements for labor, fertilizer, water use, and other issues.

In leading the work of the "command zone," Yu Jiajun fully utilized the wisdom of the masses and listened to everyone's opinions. For example, the first problem encountered by the "command zone" in the rice planting work was the dense planting specifications. "Will increasing the density cause seedling rot? Can large-scale seedling rot be avoided as easily as in small experimental plots?" Old farmer Xia Haiyun raised this question. In order to clarify this issue, the cadres of the "command zone" led the masses to summarize the experience of densely planting rice last year, and found out the reasons why some fields experienced seedling rot, mainly due to poor ventilation and light transmission. After repeated research by everyone, some commune members suggested that the method of planting in sunny strips adopted last year could solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission, and in fact achieved high yields. This issue greatly inspired Yu Jiajun, prompting him to think of the issues of wind direction and water direction from the concept of facing the sun, and immediately organized cadres to conduct a general survey of the terrain of all the fields in the "command zone," discussed the planting direction with the farmers, and finally determined several principles for planting seedlings: On the flat dam fields, the method of opening ridges from north to south and planting strips from east to west can be adopted, so that the sunlight can shine on the rows of rice seedlings from morning to night, the east-west wind can blow along the rows, and the north-south wind can circulate along the row spacing and nest spacing; the direction of sunshine and wind direction in the "overlapping yin mountain fields" often conflict, because the wind direction will change when it encounters the mountain slope head-on. At this time, the main consideration should be the short sunshine time of the "yin mountain fields," and the method of facing the sun should be adopted; for the "Zhengchong fields" with poor flood control conditions, the water direction should be the main consideration, and strips should be planted along the water direction to prevent the seedling racks from being washed down by mountain floods; the "Bang fields" and "Ao fields" are ventilated on all sides, and crops are most easily blown down by the wind if they are not planted in strips along the wind direction. Therefore, when there is a contradiction between facing the sun and following the wind, strips should be planted along the wind direction, and attention should also be paid to facing the sun when opening ridges.

What is the best way to arrange crop varieties, time, and labor? This problem was also solved from the production of the "command zone." For example, according to the current dense planting specifications, to carry out large-scale planting on 2,000 mu of fields, the amount of labor required will increase by more than double. Deep plowing, increasing the application of fertilizer, and taking care of the production of multiple crops such as wheat, rapeseed, sweet potatoes, corn, and cotton in the same period, the labor force is even more insufficient. In addition to vigorously grasping tool reform, Yu Jiajun also learned a set of "three combinations" methods for arranging crops, time, and labor from the masses. In terms of crop arrangement, the situation of planting double-cropping rice in all paddy fields and generally using a single variety in the past was changed. The rice fields were arranged separately for single-season early rice, mid-season rice, and late-season rice, and ten varieties such as Nantao, Magu, and Shengli Xian were adopted separately, and seedlings were cultivated and sprouted in batches, so that the seedling planting period was extended from the previous two solar terms to four or five solar terms, which can greatly alleviate the shortage of labor during the planting stage. In order to prevent the production of miscellaneous grains, wheat, and cash crops from crowding into the rice transplanting period, the "command zone" divided the future farm work into five stages according to the growth rules of various crops: the transplanting period of early, middle, and late rice as three stages; in the two stages before the previous season of rice is transplanted and the next season of rice has not yet begun transplanting, concentrate on attacking crops on dry land, these two stages are just important opportunities for wheat harvesting, sowing miscellaneous grains and cash crops. This arrangement also eased the labor shortage.

Recently, the Fushun County Party Committee held a district party committee secretary meeting, introduced the practice of establishing large-scale, high-yield "command zones," and the districts and communes throughout the county quickly promoted this leadership method, forming a large-scale, high-yield "command network" throughout the county.

### 适应大面积高产运动创造新的领导方法  富顺建立高产“指挥区”

　　适应大面积高产运动创造新的领导方法
　　富顺建立高产“指挥区”
    本报成都16日电　记者王焕斗报道：为加强对大面积高额丰产田的领导，四川富顺县最近出现了许多大面积高产“指挥区”。
    富顺县委第一书记于家俊在调查访问中，有一个老农对他说：“干部种的试验田是小块的，我们搞的是大块的，大块田上遇到的一些困难，小块试验田未必能够遇到……。”这些话启发了于家俊，他决定亲自搞一块大面积高产“指挥区”，以便通过在大面积高产田的生产中发现的问题和总结的经验来及时指导一般田的生产。
    记者最近访问了由于家俊同志领导的共和公社的高产“指挥区”。这个“指挥区”包括两个管理区以及附近农场和农业红专学校的部分田地，参加的成员有县委、公社、农场、红专学校的负责人，以及生产队长、社员和技术员。“指挥区”首先发动群众对二千亩高产田的各种作物提出增产的具体措施，同时对劳动力、肥料、用水等一系列问题做了细致的安排。
    于家俊在领导“指挥区”的工作中，充分地发挥群众的智慧和倾听大家的意见。例如，“指挥区”在水稻栽种工作中，首先遇到的问题是密植规格。“增加密度会不会烂秧？大面积烂秧能否像小块试验田那样容易避免？”老农民夏海云提出了这样的问题。为了弄清楚这个问题，“指挥区”的干部分头领导群众总结了去年密植水稻的经验，找出了有些田发生烂秧的原因，主要是通风透光不良。经过大家反复研究之后，有些社员提出了去年采用向阳条栽的办法，可以解决通风透光的问题，而且事实上获得了高产。这个问题对于家俊有很大启发，使他从向阳联想到风向和水向的问题，并立即组织干部普查“指挥区”全部田地的地形，跟农民一同探讨栽插的方向，最后确定了几项栽秧的原则：平坝上的田地，可以采用南北开厢东西条栽的方法，这样，可使阳光顺着一行行稻苗从早照到晚，东西风可以顺着行吹，南北风可以顺行距和窝距流通；“叠阴山田”的日照方向与风向常有矛盾，因为风向迎面遇到山坡会改变方向，这时，主要应考虑“阴山田”的日照时间短，采取以向阳为主的办法；防洪条件不好的“正冲田”，应当以水向为主，顺水条栽，防止苗架被山洪冲倒；“塝田”、“坳田”四面通风，作物如果不顺风条栽最易被风吹倒，因此在向阳与顺风发生矛盾时，应该顺风条栽，在开厢上也要注意向阳。
    作物品种、时间、劳动力怎样安排最好？这个问题也从“指挥区”的生产中取得了解决的办法。例如按照目前密植规格，要在两千亩田地上进行大面积栽种，用工量要增加一倍以上，深耕、增施肥料以及同一时期还要照顾小麦、油菜、红薯、玉米、棉花等多种作物的生产，劳动力就更显得不够用了。除了大抓工具改革以外，于家俊还从群众中摸索出一套安排作物、时间、劳动力的“三结合”方法。在作物安排上，改变了往年的水田全种双季稻又普遍采用单一品种的状况，把稻田分别安排为一季早稻、中稻、晚稻，并分别采取用南特号、麻谷、胜利籼等十种品种，并实行分批育秧、催秧，使栽秧期限由往年的两个节令延长到四五个节令，这就可以大大缓和栽插阶段劳动力不足的状况。为了不使杂粮、小麦、经济作物的生产挤进插秧期，“指挥区”按照各种作物生长的规律，把今后的农活分成五个阶段：早、中、晚稻的栽插期作为三个阶段；在前一季水稻栽完、后一季水稻尚未开始插秧的两个阶段，集中突击旱地上的作物，这两个阶段正好是麦收、播种杂粮和经济作物的重要时机。这样安排也缓和了劳动力紧张状况。
    最近，富顺县委召开区委书记会议，介绍了建立大面积高产“指挥区”的做法，全县各区、社很快推广了这种领导方法，并在全县形成了大面积高产“指挥网”。
