Overseas Chinese Support the Government's Swift Quelling of the Tibetan Rebellion
Comrade He Xiangning Discusses China's Overseas Chinese Affairs and Policies

Chairman, fellow delegates, comrades:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft of the 1959 National Economic Plan," and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft."

The Motherland's Splendid Rivers and Mountains Display a Thriving Scene

In the four years from the First National People's Congress to the present, the international and domestic situations have undergone tremendous development and change. The international situation is one where the East wind further prevails over the West wind. The forces of socialism, national revolution, and other peace-loving forces are growing rapidly, while the imperialist camp is riddled with contradictions and falling apart. Their war policies and aggressive policies have repeatedly suffered severe blows and have been defeated time and again. As Chairman Mao said: The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day.

Domestically, we are in a great era of rapid progress where "one day equals twenty years." Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, our great motherland's nine million square kilometers of beautiful rivers and mountains are showing a thriving scene. With the victorious over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, our country has laid the initial foundation for industrialization. In the countryside, after cooperativization, people's communes were realized, which forever ended the history of rural poverty. Since last year, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of the whole country have achieved a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The output of the main items of industrial and agricultural production – steel, coal, grain, and cotton – has increased several times over. This speed is beyond the reach of any of the most developed capitalist countries in the world. Now the people of the whole country are continuing to make a great leap forward. We are full of confidence that the national economic plan targets set by the state will certainly be victoriously and over-fulfillingly completed.

Dependents of Overseas Chinese and Returned Overseas Chinese Warmly Support the People's Communes; The State Has Made Proper Arrangements for Their Labor, Material Supplies, etc.

Under this favorable situation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, great achievements have been made in overseas Chinese affairs and domestic affairs related to returned overseas Chinese in the past four years.

In recent years, the Party and the government have resolutely led returned overseas Chinese, dependents of overseas Chinese, and the people of the whole country to carry out the socialist revolution and actively participate in socialist construction; at the same time, based on their characteristics and proceeding from the interests of 600 million people, the principles of overall consideration and appropriate arrangement have been adopted to provide appropriate care.

The government has promulgated and implemented a series of policies and regulations concerning the protection of the special interests of overseas Chinese, such as the order to implement the policy of protecting remittances from overseas Chinese, the preferential measures for overseas Chinese to invest in state-owned overseas Chinese investment companies, the preferential measures of the customs for luggage and articles carried by returned overseas Chinese, the regulations on preferential treatment for overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country, and the measures for taking care of the enterprises of returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen in the socialist transformation, and so on. In addition, practical and effective measures have also been taken for the employment and schooling of returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese students returning to China.

The government's policy of "treating everyone equally and giving appropriate consideration" has mobilized the positive factors of dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese and brought into play their strength in building the socialist motherland. In the past four years, more than 110,000 returned overseas Chinese have participated in the socialist construction of the motherland. More than 21,000 overseas Chinese students returning to China have enrolled in schools and pursued further studies in order to contribute greater strength to the construction of the motherland. Overseas Chinese investment companies in Guangdong, Fujian, Shanghai, Yunnan, Guangxi, Shandong, and Wenzhou, Zhejiang, are actively running enterprises and farms that are beneficial to the construction of the motherland and the people's lives. So far, they have established 88 enterprises and 25 farms invested in and run by overseas Chinese. Not only that, but overseas Chinese have also donated funds in various places to establish more than 1,000 primary schools, hundreds of middle schools, and many hospitals and other welfare undertakings.

The Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune Movement in 1958 have given dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese a new look, and domestic work related to overseas Chinese affairs has entered a new stage. The people's communes are fully in line with the fundamental interests of dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, and the vast number of dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese warmly support the people's communes. One hundred percent of overseas Chinese households in rural areas actively participated in the people's communes, and more than 95 percent of dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese participated in various construction undertakings of the communes, and many red banner bearers and model figures emerged in labor production. The National Overseas Chinese Federation conference in December last year commended and rewarded 53 advanced collective units and 301 model figures. They are glorious examples for the vast number of returned overseas Chinese, dependents of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese students returning to China. Among them are experts in high-yield agriculture, experts in tropical crops, heroes on the steel front, heroic militiamen guarding the coastal defense front, scientific workers and engineers who have achieved international levels of creation and invention, and athletes who have broken world records.

Despite the increasing patriotism and political awareness of dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, in the process of the people's commune and after the realization of the people's commune, the state still implemented the policy of "treating everyone equally and giving appropriate consideration" based on the characteristics of dependents of overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese students returning to China: the personal means of livelihood owned by dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese commune members are always privately owned, and remittances from overseas Chinese and deposits are entirely at the disposal of individuals, and can be used for living, saving, investing in production, or running welfare undertakings. Dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese can rely on remittances from overseas Chinese to maintain their entire lives, and the commune should not interfere. Even if dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese commune members have remittance income, the commune must give them the same treatment as other commune members in terms of both the supply part and the wage part during distribution.

Overseas Chinese investment is still handled in accordance with the measures promulgated by the State Council. The shares invested in state-owned overseas Chinese investment companies, even after the completion of socialism, still belong to the investors, and the dividends earned, as long as they do not exceed 50 percent of the current year's dividends, can be remitted abroad after approval by the foreign exchange authorities. If investors require work, they can be given priority employment based on the needs of the company's relevant enterprises and the specific circumstances of the investors. This year alone, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Investment Company paid dividends of more than 2 million yuan.

The communes and the state have also made proper arrangements for the labor and material supply of dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, as well as for the schooling and employment of overseas Chinese students returning to China for further education. When arranging labor for some dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese who are not yet accustomed to labor, it is best to pay attention to gradually transitioning from simple to complex and from light to heavy. At present, I think it is best, under the unified planning of the state, to encourage them to plant tropical and subtropical cash crops, or to encourage them to participate in the production of the food industry, daily necessities industry, sideline occupations, light industry, and handicraft industry. This can provide more raw materials and more products to meet the needs of urban and rural markets, and it can also enable dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to be better arranged and give play to their enthusiasm for building the motherland.

The above-mentioned measures will not only make the lives of dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese better, but will also better mobilize and give play to their enthusiasm, enabling them to continue to make a great leap forward together with the people of the whole country, consolidate and build people's communes together with the people of the whole country, carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution, improve labor productivity, and complete and over-fulfill the 1959 national economic plan centered on steel, grain, coal, and cotton, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Protect the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Overseas Chinese and Guide Them to Be Vigilant Against Imperialist Conspiracies and Correctly Handle Their Relations with the Countries and Peoples Where They Reside

Overseas Chinese affairs work should, on the one hand, do its best to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, and on the other hand, should always pay attention to guiding them to be vigilant against imperialist conspiracies at any time and to correctly handle their relations with the countries and peoples where they reside. The establishment of the People's Republic of China and its great achievements in socialist construction have changed the status and situation of overseas Chinese, and their relations with the countries and peoples where they reside are also different from the past. We need to carry out a series of work based on this new situation.

For many years, overseas Chinese have suffered from the bullying and oppression of imperialism abroad. The Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionary government not only had no power to protect overseas Chinese, but also persecuted overseas Chinese, so that overseas Chinese became "overseas orphans."

The establishment of New China and its great achievements have ended the humiliating history of overseas Chinese, which makes overseas Chinese infinitely excited. They are overjoyed to have such a lovely and strong socialist motherland, and they are proud of the motherland's growing international status. However, the overseas Chinese's inclination towards and love for the motherland makes the imperialists, especially the US imperialists, extremely fearful and hateful. Dulles, on the one hand, had to admit in the face of the facts that the People's Republic of China "enjoys extremely high prestige among overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese expect to receive its leadership to a very large extent"; on the other hand, he fabricated the rumor that overseas Chinese were carrying out "subversion and overthrowing local governments" in an attempt to provoke friendly relations between Southeast Asian countries and our country. Facts speak louder than words. Those who are carrying out subversive activities in countries such as Indonesia, Burma, and Cambodia are by no means overseas Chinese who love the motherland, but precisely the US imperialists themselves.

Our government has always advised overseas Chinese not to participate in local political activities and to respect local laws and customs. Our overseas compatriots have performed this very well. This fact is recognized by the authorities and people of the countries where they reside.

The imperialists use the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese as an excuse to sow discord and say that overseas Chinese are the fifth column, but the treaty between China and Indonesia on resolving the issue of dual nationality has long shattered this conspiracy. The issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese is a problem left over from the past history. We advocate that overseas Chinese with dual nationality should choose their nationality according to the principle of voluntariness. Our attitude towards overseas Chinese with dual nationality choosing their nationality is: If overseas Chinese voluntarily join the nationality of the country where they reside, that is very good, we express our understanding and support and encourage them to work hard for the independence and prosperity of the country where they reside; if overseas Chinese voluntarily retain Chinese nationality, that is also good, we will educate them to abide by the laws of the country where they reside, help the country where they reside to develop economic construction, and take the initiative to improve friendly relations with the local people. If overseas Chinese are willing to return to China, that is also good, we will guide them to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland together with the people of the country.

The US imperialists also carry out provocations and slanders, saying that "overseas Chinese manipulate and monopolize the local national economy." The fact is not like this at all. It is imperialism that monopolizes the economies of nationalist countries in Southeast Asia, while the overseas Chinese economy contributes to the development of the local economy; both the overseas Chinese economy and the local national economy are equally subjected to the oppression and destruction of the imperialist economy.

The US imperialists often fabricate the rumor that the overseas Chinese economy "endangers the local economy," which is only to cover up US imperialist economic aggression.

In order to support the development of the national economies of nationalist countries, we encourage overseas Chinese, where possible, to gradually shift commercial capital to industry in order to assist local development of national industry and get rid of the shackles of colonialism. This is beneficial to both the local people and the overseas Chinese.

In order to alienate Southeast Asian countries from overseas Chinese and from China, the US imperialists are using every possible conspiracy and trick, and some Southeast Asian countries have not recognized this and have adopted erroneous policies of excluding overseas Chinese, which is entirely a trick of the US imperialists to sow discord. We hope that this situation can be changed.

The motherland attaches great importance to the situation of overseas Chinese and does its best to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. We earnestly hope that overseas Chinese can better unite and cooperate, and in the spirit of "patriotism as one family," "patriotism regardless of order," and "harmony is the most valuable," strive for and unite all those who can be strived for and united. Jointly run overseas Chinese welfare and cultural undertakings, and consolidate and develop close friendship with the local people.

It is hoped that the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu will no longer rely on others and lose sovereignty, and fall into a dead end

Just as our country's construction is in full swing, shining brightly, and the people of the whole country are going all out and striving for the top to build our beautiful socialist country, we cannot but think that the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu are still suffering from the bullying and oppression of US imperialism.

US imperialism occupies our country's territory of Taiwan, plots to create "two Chinas," and threatens peace in the Far East and the world, making the situation of overseas Chinese more complicated and difficult, which is absolutely unacceptable to the people of our country and overseas Chinese.

Last year, our country's great victory in the struggle against the United States on the issue of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu made overseas Chinese extremely excited, and a small number of overseas Chinese who were blinded and deceived by US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique gradually recognized the true face of US imperialism as a paper tiger and suddenly realized their mistakes. I hope that overseas Chinese will further unite and resolutely oppose the US imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and support the struggle of the motherland to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu and complete the great cause of national reunification.

I hope that the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan will value the interests of the country and the righteousness of the nation, and recognize that US imperialism is our common enemy. Any illusion that "World War III" will come and relying on US imperialism to "counterattack the mainland" is just a self-comfort. Didn't the US imperialists openly say that Taiwan is just a "political entity that exists in fact"? In the eyes of the US imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is just a tool to invade China! Now you also have to admit that US imperialism is unreliable. I hope that you will not succumb to the pressure of US imperialism, rely on others, lose sovereignty, fall into a dead end, and be cursed by future generations forever!

The Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu should come to their senses. There is a way out for all patriots. The door of the motherland is still open to you. Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu must return to the embrace of the motherland!

The Tibetan Rebel Group's Calculation Was Completely Wrong

Overseas Chinese were extremely angry at the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary group for colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to carry out armed rebellion. Their act of betraying the motherland was resolutely opposed by the people of all ethnic groups in China. The Tibetan rebel group regarded the central government's attitude of utmost benevolence and righteousness as weak and deceitful, and believed that imperialism and Indian expansionists would "assist" them when they launched the rebellion. However, their calculations were completely wrong. The era of imperialists invading China and enslaving the Chinese people has long gone. Any conspiracy by imperialists and foreign reactionaries to undermine our country's unity is doomed to failure. Tibet is Chinese territory, and the conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists to split Tibet from China has been met with the most resolute opposition and condemnation from the Chinese people. Quelling the Tibetan rebellion is entirely China's internal affair.

Overseas Chinese support all the policies and measures of the government to quickly quell the Tibetan rebellion. The quelling of the Tibetan rebellion has made all ethnic groups in our country more united and our country's unity more consolidated. In the big family of the motherland, a new page has been opened in Tibetan history, opening up a road of democracy and new life for the vast number of monks and lay people in Tibet!

专栏：

    华侨拥护政府迅速平定西藏叛乱
    何香凝代表谈我国的侨务工作和侨务政策主席、各位代表、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”。
    祖国锦绣河山出现一派欣欣向荣景象
    从第一届全国人民代表大会到现在，四年来，国际国内形势有了巨大的发展和变化。国际形势是东风进一步压倒西风，社会主义的力量、民族革命的力量和其他爱好和平的力量迅速增长，帝国主义阵营矛盾重重、四分五裂。他们的战争政策和侵略政策一再受到严重打击，一次又一次地遭到失败。正如毛主席所说：敌人在一天天烂下去，我们在一天天好起来。
    国内正处在“一天等于二十年”的飞速跃进的伟大时代。在党中央、毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导下，我们伟大祖国的九百万平方公里的锦绣山河，出现了一派欣欣向荣的景象。随着第一个五年计划的胜利超额完成，我国已经奠定了工业化的初步基础。在农村，合作化之后又实现了人民公社化，这就永远结束了农村的贫困的历史。去年以来，全国人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，实现了工农业生产的大跃进，工农业生产的主要项目——钢、煤、粮、棉的产量成倍的增长，这种速度使世界上任何最发达的资本主义国家都望尘莫及。现在全国人民正在继续大跃进。我们充满着信心，国家所规定的国民经济计划指标一定能够胜利地、超额地完成。
    侨眷归侨热烈拥护人民公社；国家对他们的劳动、物资供应等作了妥善安排
    在这一有利的形势下，由于党中央、毛主席和国务院的正确领导，四年来国外华侨工作和国内侨务工作都获得了很大的成绩。
    几年来，党和政府坚决领导归侨、侨眷和全国人民一道，进行社会主义革命，积极参加社会主义建设；同时也根据他们的特点和从六亿人民的利益出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排的原则，作了适当照顾。
    政府曾经公布和执行了一系列的有关保护华侨特殊利益的政策法令，诸如贯彻保护侨汇政策的命令、华侨投资于国营华侨投资公司的优待办法、海关对归侨携带行李物品优待办法、华侨出入国境优待条例、归侨工商业家企业在社会主义改造中照顾处理办法等等。此外，对归侨、归国华侨学生的就业、就学等方面，也采取了切实有效的措施。
    政府“一视同仁、适当照顾”的政策，调动了侨眷归侨的积极因素，发挥了他们建设社会主义祖国的力量。四年来，有十一万多归侨参加了祖国的社会主义建设。二万一千多归国华侨学生入学和升学，从事深造，以便他们为祖国建设贡献更大的力量。广东、福建、上海、云南、广西、山东和浙江温州等地的华侨投资公司积极兴办有利于祖国建设和人民生活的企业、农场，到目前为止，他们举办的企业已有八十八个，华侨投资兴办的农场已有二十五个。不仅如此，华侨还在各地捐资兴办了一千多所小学、几百所中学和许多医院及其它福利事业。
    一九五八年全国大跃进和人民公社化运动，更使侨眷、归侨面目一新，国内侨务工作走上了一个新的阶段。人民公社完全符合侨眷、归侨的根本利益，广大侨眷、归侨热烈拥护人民公社。农村中百分之百的侨户积极参加了人民公社，百分之九十五以上的侨眷、归侨参加了公社的各项建设事业，并且在劳动生产中涌现了不少红旗手和模范人物。去年十二月全国侨联会议上就表扬和奖励了五十三个集体先进单位，三百零一位模范人物。他们是广大归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生的光荣榜样。他们当中有农业丰产的能手，热带作物的专家，钢铁战线上的英雄，守卫海防前哨的英勇民兵，创造发明达到国际水平的科学工作者和工程师，打破世界纪录的运动员。
    尽管侨眷、归侨的爱国热情和政治觉悟日益提高，在人民公社化过程当中和实现了人民公社化以后，国家还是根据侨眷、归侨、归国华侨学生的特点，贯彻了“一视同仁、适当照顾”的政策：侨眷、归侨社员个人所有的生活资料永远归私人所有，侨汇、存款完全由个人支　配，用于生活、储蓄、投资生产或举办福利事业一律听便。侨眷、归侨可以依靠侨汇维持全部生活，公社不应当加以干涉。即使侨眷、归侨社员有侨汇收入，公社在分配的时候，无论供给部分或工资部分，都必须象别的社员一样照给。
    华侨投资仍按国务院颁布的办法处理。投资于国营华侨投资公司的股金，即使到社会主义建成后，也还是归投资人所有，所得股息只要不超过本年股息的百分之五十，经过外汇主管机关批准后可以汇往国外。投资人如果要求工作，可以根据公司有关企业的需要和投资人的具体情况，优先录用。今年仅广东华侨投资公司，支付的股息就达二百多万元。
    对侨眷、归侨的劳动、物资供应和对归国升学的华侨学生的就学、就业等问题，公社和国家也都作了妥善的安排。对于一部分还不大习惯劳动的侨眷、归侨，在安排他们劳动的时候，最好要注意逐步由简到繁，由轻到重。在目前来说，我认为最好是在国家统一规划之下，鼓励他们种植热带、亚热带经济作物，或者鼓励他们参加食品工业、日用品工业、副业、轻工业、手工业的生产。这样既可以提供更多的原料、更多的产品，供应城乡市场的需要，又可以使侨眷、归侨都能得到更妥善的安排，发挥建设祖国的积极性。
    上述种种措施不仅将使侨眷、归侨生活得更加美好，而且也必将更好地调动和发挥他们的积极性，使他们能和全国人民一道继续大跃进，和全国人民一道，巩固与建设人民公社，开展技术革命和文化革命，提高劳动生产率，完成和超额完成以钢、粮、煤、棉为中心的一九五九年国民经济计划，鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义。
    保护国外华侨的正当权利和利益，引导他们警惕帝国主义的阴谋，正确处理他们和所在国家和人民的关系
    国外华侨工作一方面要尽力保护华侨的正当的权利和利益，另一方面又要经常注意引导他们随时警惕帝国主义的阴谋，正确地处理他们同所在国家和人民的关系。中华人民共和国的建立和它在社会主义建设中的伟大成就，使得华侨的地位、处境发生了变化，从而他们同所在国家和人民的关系也就和过去有所不同。我们需要根据这种新的情况进行一系列的工作。
    多少年来，华侨在国外受尽了帝国主义的欺凌和压迫。清朝和国民党反动政府，不但无力保护华侨，而且还迫害华侨，以致使华侨成为“海外孤儿”。
    新中国的成立和它取得的伟大成就，结束了海外华侨的屈辱的历史，这使华侨无限兴奋。他们以有这样可爱的、强大的社会主义祖国而欢欣鼓舞，他们以祖国国际地位日益提高而感到自豪。但是，华侨倾向祖国、热爱祖国，使帝国主义首先是美帝国主义万分恐惧和仇恨。杜勒斯一方面不得不在事实面前承认中华人民共和国在华侨中“享有极高的威信，华侨在非常大的程度上期待得到它的领导”；另一方面，又制造所谓华侨进行“颠复、推翻当地政府”的谰言，企图挑拨东南亚国家与我国的友好关系。事实胜于雄辩。在印度尼西亚、缅甸、柬埔寨等国家进行颠复活动的，绝不是热爱祖国的华侨，而恰恰是美帝国主义自己。
    我国政府一向劝告国外华侨不参加当地的政治活动，尊重当地的法令和风俗习惯。这一点，我们海外的侨胞履行得非常好。这个事实，是被他们所在国的当局和人民所公认的。
    帝国主义借口华侨双重国籍问题，进行挑拨离间，说华侨是第五纵队，但是中、印（尼）关于解决双重国籍问题的条约，早就粉碎了这一阴谋。华侨双重国籍问题，是过去历史上遗留下来的一个问题。我们主张让具有双重国籍的华侨根据自愿的原则选择国籍。我们对具有双重国籍的华侨选择国籍的态度是：华侨如果自愿参加侨居国国籍，很好，我们表示谅解，并且赞助并鼓励他们为所在国的独立和繁荣富强而努力；华侨自愿保留中国国籍，同样好，我们则教育他们遵守侨居国法律，帮助侨居国发展经济建设，主动搞好和当地人民的友好关系。华侨如果愿意回国，也好，我们要引导他们和国内人民一道，参加祖国社会主义建设。
    美帝国主义者还进行挑拨诽谤，说“华侨操纵和垄断着当地的国民经济”。事实完全不是这样。垄断东南亚民族主义国家经济的是帝国主义，而华侨经济对当地经济的发展却是有贡献的；华侨经济和当地民族经济，都同样遭受帝国主义经济的压迫和摧毁。
    美帝国主义经常制造所谓华侨经济“危害当地经济”的谰言，这只不过是为了掩饰美帝国主义经济侵略而已。
    为了支持民族主义国家民族经济的发展，我们鼓励华侨，在可能条件下，将商业资本逐步转营工业，以协助当地发展民族工业，摆脱殖民主义者的羁绊。这样做，对当地人民和华侨都是有利的。
    为了离间东南亚国家同华侨以及同中国的关系，美帝国主义的阴谋诡计是无所不用其极的，有些东南亚国家竟没有认识到这一点，采取了错误的排斥华侨的政策，这完全是中了美帝国主义挑拨离间的奸计。我们希望这种状况能够得以改变。
      祖国对华侨的处境，寄予很大的关怀，并且尽力保护华侨的正当权益。我们热切希望华侨能更好地团结合作，本着“爱国一家”、“爱国不分先后”、“和为贵”的精神，争取、团结一切可以争取、团结的人。共同办好华侨福利、文化事业，并巩固与发展和当地人民的亲切友谊。
    希望台澎金马的国民党军政人员不要再仰人鼻息，丧失主权，自陷于绝路
    正当我国建设方兴未艾，光芒万丈，全国人民鼓足干劲、力争上游，建设我们美好的社会主义国家的时候，我们不能不想到，台、澎、金、马的同胞，还在遭受着美帝国主义欺凌和压迫。
    美帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾，阴谋制造“两个中国”，威胁远东和世界和平，使华侨的处境更加复杂和困难，这是我国人民和国外华侨绝对不能容许的。
    去年，我国在台、澎、金、马问题上对美斗争的伟大胜利，使国外华侨兴奋异常，一小部分被美帝国主义和蒋介石集团蒙蔽、欺骗的华侨，逐步认识了美帝国主义的纸老虎的真面目，幡然悔悟。我希望国外华侨进一步地团结起来，坚决反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，支持祖国解放台、澎、金、马，完成祖国统一大业的斗争。
    我希望台湾的国民党军政人员，以国家利益为贵，以民族大义为重，认清美帝国主义是我们的共同敌人。任何幻想“第三次世界大战”就会到来，依靠美帝国主义“反攻大陆”，都只不过是聊以自慰罢了。美帝国主义者不是公开说，台湾不过是一个“事实上存在的政治单位”吗？在美帝国主义者心目中，蒋介石集团只不过是侵略中国的工具而已！现在你们也不得不承认美帝国主义不可靠了。我希望你们不要屈服于美帝国主义的压力，仰人鼻息，丧失主权，自陷于绝路，永受后世唾骂！
    台、澎、金、马的国民党军政人员应当觉悟过来。一切爱国者都有出路。祖国的大门还是向你们开着的。台、澎、金、马一定要回到祖国的怀抱！
    西藏叛乱集团的算盘完全打错了
    国外华侨对前西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，进行武装叛乱，感到极大愤怒。他们这种背叛祖国的行为，遭受了全中国各族人民的坚决反对。西藏叛乱集团把中央仁至义尽的态度看作软弱可欺，认为帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子在他们发动叛乱的时候，是会“援助”他们。但是，他们的算盘完全打错了，帝国主义侵略中国、奴役中国人民的时代，早已经一去不复返了。任何帝国主义者和外国反动派企图破坏我国团结的阴谋都必然遭到失败。西藏是中国的领土，帝国主义者、印度扩张主义分子，企图把西藏从中国分裂出去的阴谋遭到了中国人民的最坚决的反对和谴责。平定西藏叛乱，完全是中国的内政。
    国外华侨拥护政府迅速平定西藏叛乱的一切政策和措施。西藏叛乱的平定，使我国各民族更加团结，使我国的统一更加巩固。在祖国的大家庭中，西藏历史展开了新的一页，为西藏广大僧俗人民开辟了民主、新生的大道！
