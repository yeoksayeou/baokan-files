Anthology of Poems by Revolutionary Martyrs

    Blood Letters
    In Fu’s blood writes large characters, lying slantwise on Nanjing Road, this unforgettable day—adorned every year… Blood writes large characters, engraving thousands of shouts, this unforgettable day—tens of thousands of hearts enraged… Blood writes large characters, recording the course of the conflict, this unforgettable day—grimly laughing at so many traitors…
  “May Thirtieth” oh! Stand up and walk on Nanjing Road! Shoot your bloody light to the ends of the earth, project your strong posture onto the Huangpu River. Let your bell-like prophecy shake the universe! Today is their paradise, tomorrow is their hell, today our blood writes words, someday their tears may bathe. I am the beginning of a rebellion, I am also history's firstborn, I am a petrel, I am the sharp thorn of the times. Four years of blood are enough to decorate, two bloody words should no longer shine, thousands of heart sounds are resolute enough, this day should be destroyed immediately!

    Who Built the World's Western-Style Buildings?
    Ouyang Li'an Who built the world's western-style buildings, who sits in the western-style buildings and laughs heartily, who guards the door, who resolutely struggles for the workers? The world's western-style buildings are built by us workers, the capitalists sit in the western-style buildings and laugh heartily, the Kuomintang guards the door, the Communist Party resolutely struggles for the workers!

    My "Confession"
    Chen Ran Let heavy iron shackles clang under my feet, let you raise the whip high, I don't need any confession, even if my chest faces a bloody bayonet! A man cannot lower his noble head, only the cowardly beg for "freedom"; what does torture count for? Death cannot make me speak! I laugh loudly at death, the devil's palace shakes with laughter; this is me—a Communist Party member's confession, singing a funeral song to bury the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty.

    革命烈士诗钞
    血字
    殷夫血液写成的大字，斜斜地躺在南京路，这个难忘的日子——润饰着一年一度……血液写成的大字，刻划着千万声的高呼，这个难忘的日子——几万个心灵暴怒……血液写成的大字，记录着冲突的经过，这个难忘的日子——狞笑着几多叛徒……
  “五卅”哟！立起来，在南京路走！把你血的光芒射到天的尽
  头，把你刚强的姿态投映到黄
  浦江。把你的洪钟般的预言震动
  宇宙！今日他们的天堂，他日他们的地狱，今日我们的血液写成字，异日他们的泪水可入浴。我是一个叛乱的开始，我也是历史的长子，我是海燕，我是时代的尖刺。四年的血液润饰够了，两个血字不该再放光辉，千万的心音够坚决了，这个日子应该即刻消毁！
    天下洋楼什么人造
    欧阳立安天下洋楼什么人造，什么人坐在洋楼哈哈笑，什么人看门来把守，什么人为工人坚决奋斗？天下洋楼我工人造，资本家坐在洋楼哈哈笑，国民党看门来把守，共产党为工人坚决奋斗！
    我的“自白”书
    陈然任脚下响着沉重的铁镣，任你把皮鞭举得高高，我不需要什么自白，哪怕胸口对着带血的刺
  刀！人，不能低下高贵的头，只有怕死鬼才乞求“自
  由”；毒刑拷打算得了什么？死亡也无法叫我开口！对着死亡我放声大笑，魔鬼的宫殿在笑声中动
  摇；这就是我——一个共产党
  员的自白，高唱葬歌埋葬蒋家王朝。
