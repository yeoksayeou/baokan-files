    Be Good at Learning
    Wang Weixuan
    "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher. I choose his good qualities and follow them, and his bad qualities and correct them in myself." Confucius' words still have significance today. "Choose his good qualities and follow them" is learning from the positive; "his bad qualities and correct them" is learning from the negative. Whether positive or negative, they are worth emphasizing for those who are good at learning.
    "Teacher" is not something very mysterious. "Teacher," in a sense, is simply someone who knows a little more or a little deeper than oneself in a certain aspect. Whoever knows more than us, we should learn from him and recognize him as a "teacher." Only in this way can we constantly enrich our knowledge. Confucius had three thousand disciples, seventy of whom were virtuous, and was a famous educator in ancient China. But did he know everything? No. When two children argued about the distance of the sun, the old man was confused and unable to answer. His agricultural knowledge was also poor. "Fan Chi asked to learn about farming. Confucius said, 'I am not as good as an old farmer.' He asked to learn about gardening. Confucius said, 'I am not as good as an old gardener.'" (The Analects, "Zi Lu"). From this, it can be seen that Confucius was not an "omnipotent" person who knew everything. But how did he become an educator at that time? Confucius himself answered this question: "I am not one who is born with knowledge, but one who loves antiquity and diligently seeks it." ("Shu Er") This illustrates that learning from everyone who has strengths is a very important thing.
      "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher," also shows that the masses of the people are a sea of ​​wisdom. One person's energy and wisdom are always limited, while the wisdom of the broad masses is infinite. The broad masses are constantly creating material wealth and spiritual wealth in the struggle for production and the class struggle. Therefore, only those who constantly draw wisdom from the broad masses can enrich their knowledge more quickly.
    Intellectuals learn some indirect knowledge from books. As long as this indirect knowledge conforms to objective reality and is a "scientific abstraction," then it is correct and useful knowledge. However, it is not enough for intellectuals to learn only from books. They should also learn from workers and peasants and go to production practice to test their book knowledge in practice. Since the Great Leap Forward, many intellectuals have begun to realize the inadequacy of the book knowledge they have learned, and have gone to the countryside and factories to contact workers and peasants, and have learned many truths from the working people. For example, some teachers at Beijing Agricultural University solved problems that had not been solved in books for decades after being sent to the countryside. Many things in ancient and modern times at home and abroad illustrate that it is very incomplete to learn only from books. Sima Qian of the Han Dynasty traveled to famous mountains and rivers, his footprints covering the prefectures and kingdoms of the time, collecting lost writings and anecdotes. In this way, he was able to "widely explore, connect scriptures, and gallop through thousands of years of ancient and modern times." (Ban Gu: "Book of Han," "Biography of Sima Qian") Li Shizhen, a pharmacologist of the Ming Dynasty, traveled all over half of China, learning and understanding the characteristics of various drugs from fishermen, hunters, woodcutters, farmers, porters, and other working people. In this way, he successfully compiled the "Compendium of Materia Medica," which has great scientific value. Gorky wandered throughout Russia, learning living lessons from cooks, sailors, porters, and coolies, and getting to know the innermost layers of life. The Soviet writer Alexei Tolstoy began to study the Russian folk language from the confessions of the court, and from then on, he began to master the skills of the language. These examples show that the knowledge of a fisherman or woodcutter about pharmacology is generally not as good as that of a famous doctor who has practiced medicine for many years, but the characteristics of drugs mastered by many fishermen or woodcutters far exceed those of a famous doctor. A single confession is insignificant, but many confessions have become a rich treasure of artistic language. Therefore, we must be good at learning from the masses of the people and be good at seizing all learning opportunities.
    The classic Marxist writers are exemplary figures who are best at learning from the masses of the people. Marx referred to more than a thousand kinds of books when writing "Capital." "Capital" also quoted the words of many unknown writers. Some unknown writers, many people think are not worth mentioning, but Marx said, "I execute historical judgment and give everyone the reward they deserve." (See "Reminiscences of Marx and Engels," page 77) In order to write more than 20 pages of articles on British labor law in "Capital," he carefully studied the blue books in the entire British Museum Reading Room containing reports from British and Scottish investigation committees and factory inspectors. He mastered extremely rich practical materials from these books that no one cared about. Lenin's spirit of learning from everyone with experience and knowledge is also worth emulating. He said, "Knowing that I myself know too little, I must make myself understand more." ("Selected Works of Lenin," two-volume collection, Volume 2, page 804, People's Publishing House) Comrade Mao Zedong's idea of ​​"willingly being a pupil of the masses" is well known to everyone. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "Look downward, don't just look up at the sky. Without the interest and determination to look downward, you will never really understand China's affairs in your life." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 3, page 810) When he conducted rural surveys, he asked cadres, peasants, scholars, jailers, businessmen, and grain tax officials for advice. He regarded them as his "respectable and beloved teachers" and said: "It must be understood that the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous. Without understanding this, we cannot obtain the most basic knowledge." He also sincerely stated: "Together with all comrades in the Party, learn from the masses and continue to be a primary school student. This is my wish." (Ibid., pages 811-812) These words of Comrade Mao Zedong are such valuable instructions for us to learn from everyone with experience and real talent. The "wish" of a great leader is to "learn from the masses and continue to be a primary school student." How worthy of learning is this spirit of humility. Compared with the naive and ridiculous attitude of some half-baked intellectuals who "pretend to know what they don't know," isn't this a very stark contrast?
    However, today, not everyone truly recognizes the true meaning of "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher." There are still people who think that they have achieved some insignificant achievements, and they become complacent and feel like immortals, and they are unwilling to learn from others, and they are unwilling to be primary school students of the masses. This kind of thinking is largely due to two reasons: one is caused by the root of the bourgeois arrogance and conceit; the other is caused by the one-sidedness of ideological understanding. The former, we don't need to talk much about, because as the ideology of the exploiting class, it always thinks that it is superior, while the masses are "rabble" and "ignorant." It is a waste of words to discuss learning from the masses with this kind of people and ask them to recognize the true meaning of "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher." However, among some of our comrades, there are some who think that they have achieved results, so they can no longer humbly learn. That is a very harmful idea. Especially among young people, if this kind of thought grows, it will more easily lead people into the maze of arrogance and self-importance.
    Perhaps some people will ask: How can we learn from some idealist scholars? Of course, we must arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism and oppose all kinds of idealist ideas. However, Marxism-Leninism is not a delicate flower grown in a greenhouse, but a towering pine that has grown strong in the struggle with all kinds of idealist ideas. Therefore, in order to learn Marxism-Leninism more deeply, it is also necessary to understand what kind of medicine is sold in the gourd of idealism. That is to say, we must also learn. How can we "win every battle" without "knowing ourselves and our enemy?" Marxism is the truth, and the truth gains infinite fighting power in the debate with fallacy.
    As long as we are willing to be primary school students of the masses, learn from everyone with experience and knowledge, "take them as teachers, learn respectfully and honestly. If you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand," ("Comrade Mao Zedong on Educational Work," page 156) truly believe in the truth of "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher" and practice it, we can inherit the heritage of human culture more quickly and create a new socialist culture better.

    要善于学习
    王威宣
    “三人行，必有我师焉。择其善者而从之，其不善者而改之。”孔子这几句话现在看来，仍有意义。“择其善者而从之”，是从正面学习；“其不善者而改之”，是从反面学习。不论是正面的或反面的，对于善于学习的人来说，都是很值得重视的。
    “师”，并不是很神秘的。“师”从某种意义上来说，就是在某一方面比自己懂得多一点、深一点的人而已。谁比我们多懂一点，就应该向他学习，认他为“师”。这样，才能不断地丰富自己的知识。孔子弟子三千，贤者七十，是我国古代著名的教育家。但是，他是不是什么都懂得呢？不是的。两小儿辩日之远近，他老人家便弄得茫茫然，无以对答。他的农业知识也很差，“樊迟请学稼，子曰：‘吾不如老农’。请学为圃，子曰：‘吾不如老圃’。”（“论语”，“子路”）。由此可见，孔子并不是什么都懂的“万能人”。但是，他又怎么成了当时的教育家呢？孔子自己回答了这个问题：“我非生而知之者，好古敏以求之者也。”（“述而”）这就说明：向一切有长处的人学习，是一件很重要的事情。
      “三人行，必有我师焉”，也说明人民群众是智慧的海洋。一个人的精力和智慧总是有限的，而广大群众的智慧则是无穷的。广大群众在生产斗争和阶级斗争中不断的创造着物质财富和精神财富。因此，只有不断从广大群众中汲取智慧的人，才能更快地丰富自己的知识。
    知识分子从书本中学习了一些间接的知识，只要这些间接知识是符合客观实际的，是“科学的抽象”，那就是正确的有用的知识。然而，知识分子如果仅仅从书本中学习，那又是十分不够的，还应该向工农群众学习，应该到生产实践中去学习，把书本知识拿到实践中去考验。大跃进以来，许多知识分子开始认识自己所学的书本知识的不足，纷纷下乡、下厂接触工农群众，从劳动群众中学习了许多真知灼见。例如，北京农业大学有些教师下放农村之后，解决了几十年来书本上所没有解决的问题。古今中外有许多事情都说明：如果只从书本中学习，是很不全面的。汉司马迁游历名山大川，足迹遍当时郡国，采寻遗文逸事。这样，才能使他“涉猎者广博，贯穿经传，驰骋古今上下数千载间。”（班固：“汉书”，“司马迁传”）明朝药物学家李时珍走遍半个中国，从渔夫、狩猎手、樵夫、农民、脚夫和其他劳动群众中学习并了解了各种药物的特性。这样才把具有重大科学价值的“本草纲目”编写成功。高尔基浪游整个俄罗斯，从厨师、水手、脚夫和苦力学习了活的课本，认识了生活的最里层。苏联作家阿·托尔斯泰从法院的口供中开始研究俄罗斯民间的语言，从此以后，才开始掌握语言的技巧。从这些例子中说明：一个渔夫或樵夫对药物学的知识在一般情况下总是不如一个行医多年的名医的，但是，许许多多渔夫或樵夫所掌握的药物的特性却又远远超过了一个名医。一个人的口供微不足道，但是许多口供却成了艺术语言的丰富矿藏。所以，要善于向人民群众学习，善于抓住一切学习的机会。
    马克思主义的经典作家是最善于从人民群众中学习的典范人物。马克思在从事“资本论”的著作时，就参考了一千多种书籍。“资本论”还引证了许多无名作家的话。有些无名作家，有许多人认为是不值得一提的，然而马克思却说：“我执行历史的裁判，给每个人以应得的奖励。”（见“回忆马克思恩格斯”，七十七页）为了写“资本论”中关于英国劳工法的二十多页文章，他把整个大英博物馆阅览室里载有英国与苏格兰调查委员会和工厂视察员报告的蓝皮书都细心研究过了。从这些无人问津的书籍中掌握了极其丰富的实际资料。列宁向一切有经验、有学识的人学习的精神，也是很值得我们效法的。他说过：“明知我自己懂得的太少，那我就定要使自己懂得的更多。”（“列宁文选”两卷集，第二卷八百零四页，人民出版社）毛泽东同志“甘心当群众的小学生”的思想是我们每个人都熟知的。毛泽东同志告诉我们要：“眼睛向下，不要只是昂首望天。没有眼睛向下的兴趣和决心，是一辈子也不会真正懂得中国的事情的。”（“毛泽东选集”，第三卷，八百一十页）他在进行农村调查时，向干部、农民、秀才、狱吏、商人、钱粮师爷请教。认为他们是他的“可敬爱的先生”，并说：“必须明白：群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”他还诚挚地表示：“和全党同志共同一起向群众学习，继续当一个小学生，这就是我的志愿。”（同上，八百一十一至八百一十二页）毛泽东同志这一些话，对于我们向一切有经验、有真才实学的人学习，这是多么宝贵的指示。作为一个伟大领袖的“志愿”就是“向群众学习，继续当一个小学生”，这种虚怀若谷的精神是多么值得学习。这与某些一知半解的知识分子，“强不知以为知”的幼稚可笑的态度相比，不是形成一个非常鲜明的对照吗？
    但是，在今天，并不是每个人都真正认识“三人行，必有我师”的真谛。还有人认为有了一些微不足道的成绩，便沾沾自喜、飘飘若仙，就不甘向别人学习了，便不甘做群众的小学生了。这种思想大体上出于两种原因：一种是资产阶级的狂妄自大的病根所引起的；一种是思想认识上的片面性所引起的。前者，我们可以不必多谈，因为作为剥削阶级的思想意识，总是认为自己是高人一等的，而群众是“群氓”，是“愚昧无知”的，和这种人去谈论向群众学习，要他们认识“三人行，必有我师”的真谛，未免白费唇舌。但是，在我们一些同志中间有一部分人认为有了成绩，就可以不再虚心学习，那就是一种非常有害的想法。特别是在青年中间，如果滋长着这种思想，那就更容易使人们走入妄自尊大的迷宫。
    也许有人提出：对于某些唯心主义学者，我们怎么能够向他们学习呢？当然，我们要以马克思列宁主义思想武装自己，反对形形色色的唯心主义思想。但是，马克思列宁主义并不是在温室里长大的弱不禁风的娇嫩花草，而是与形形色色的唯心主义思想搏斗中茁壮起来的参天松柏。所以，要更深刻地学习马克思列宁主义，也有必要了解唯心主义的葫芦里到底是卖的什么膏药。就是说，也要学习。不能“知彼知己”，哪能“百战百胜？”马克思主义是真理，真理是与谬误争辩中得到无穷的战斗力的。
    只要我们甘于做人民群众的小学生，向一切有经验、有学识的人们学习，“拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂，”（“毛泽东同志论教育工作”，一百五十六页）真正相信“三人行，必有我师”的道理并且身体力行，就能使我们更快地继承人类文化的遗产，更好地创造社会主义的新文化。
