Xinhua News Agency, London, March 30th. The 26th Congress of the British Communist Party passed a political resolution on the 30th, defining the current struggle program of the British Communist Party and the working class, and explaining the long-term task of building socialism in Britain.

The political resolution stated: "The Congress is convened at a time when the British bourgeoisie is launching an all-out offensive against the working class, attempting to make them bear the full burden of the crisis caused by the British bourgeoisie's own policies. At the same time, the Conservative government's fundamental foreign policy is drastically increasing the danger of nuclear war and is frantically attacking the colonial people. Elections are imminent."

The resolution pointed out: "The current task facing the Congress is to strengthen the struggle against the Conservatives and employers, defend peace, and create political conditions to seriously defeat the Conservatives and restore the Labor Party to power with the election of Communists as members of parliament. As long as the working class and the progressive movement exert their united strength, they will surely win."

Regarding Britain's economic situation, the resolution stated that decisive changes had taken place in the capitalist world economy in the past two years, leading to the end of economic expansion and prosperity. Britain's economy has been stagnant for almost three years, eventually leading to a recession.

The resolution said: "In the face of more powerful imperialist rivals, British imperialism is desperately intensifying its exploitation of the colonies, especially Africa, at a time when the national liberation movement has developed to a completely new stage. To pay for the suppression of the colonial people and military operations, the Conservative government has placed new burdens on the British people."

The resolution further pointed out that the export difficulties shared by various capitalist countries have intensified the trade war between them and deepened the contradictions between imperialists. This can be seen in the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, the quarrels between Britain, France, and West Germany on the issue of the Common Market, and the increasingly strained relations between Britain and the Commonwealth countries. The decision to make the pound freely convertible is also exacerbating these contradictions. With British imperialism being weaker than the United States and West Germany, this will put greater pressure on the pound.

After pointing out these economic difficulties in Britain, the resolution stated that these difficulties are developing into a serious stage with the new technological advances. Therefore, the contradiction between social productive forces and the aims of the Conservatives and employers, who are attempting to resolve the economic crisis at the expense of the people's wages, living standards, and consumption, is greatly intensified.

These circumstances have shown that there is no final solution to these problems of the British people other than establishing a socialist society. The resolution called on the working class to take urgent action and put forward a current program to stop the recession. Regarding the issues of peace, national independence, and socialism, the resolution contrasted the enormous progress of socialist forces and national liberation struggles with the decline of imperialist forces. The resolution also urged people to pay attention to the dangers of war. The resolution then said that Chiang Kai-shek, the agent of the United States, continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, the US Navy remains on the Chinese seas, and the United States refuses to recognize the People's China. All of this shows that the US imperialists are determined to maintain tensions in the Far East.

The resolution emphasized that "the nuclear danger and international tension originate from the policies of the West, which are based on nuclear strategy, the aggressive plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its parallel military treaties. The current goal of the peace struggle should be to permanently stop (nuclear weapons) testing, prevent the rearmament of West Germany with nuclear weapons, and seek a peaceful solution to the German question by recognizing the German Democratic Republic and drafting a peace treaty with Germany. At the same time, a new national struggle should be re-launched to stop the United States from establishing rocket bases in Britain, drive out the American troops from British territory, and restore Britain's true military, economic, and political independence. The resolution called on "all parts of the peace movement and the labor movement to unite for the above goals."

The resolution said, "The national liberation movements now sweeping the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America are making a great contribution to the struggle for world peace and the defeat of imperialism. These far-reaching historical developments (culminating in the Bandung Conference and the Accra Conference) have changed the world situation and greatly weakened the ability of imperialism and its plans to launch world wars and implement colonial rule."

The resolution continued: "The Congress calls on people of all strata in Britain to actively support these people—those who have already achieved political independence and those who are still fighting for political independence. British imperialism and Conservatism are the common enemies of the colonial people and the British people, and every victory and progress of the colonial people helps to strengthen the British people's own struggle."

The resolution said, "The Congress pays tribute to the communists in the colonial and former colonial countries, who stand at the forefront of their people's liberation struggles and seek to unite all anti-imperialist forces in order to rapidly and completely eliminate imperialism. In these countries, any attempt to take the dangerous anti-communist path can only split and weaken the liberation movement and delay the final defeat of imperialism."

The resolution concluded: "Our Congress is convened at a time when the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system is becoming increasingly apparent. Even the enemies of socialism recognize that the enormous progress of socialism is a challenge. Capitalism has no response to such a challenge. Socialism is the only lasting solution to the problems of the British people."

The resolution said: "It is the Communist Party that points out how this can be done in its program of the British Road to Socialism. All our strength is dedicated to this goal."

    英共代表大会通过政治决议
    号召工人阶级回击资产阶级的进攻
    加紧维护和平积极声援殖民地人民
    新华社伦敦30日电　英国共产党第二十六次代表大会30日通过一项政治决议，确定了英国共产党和工人阶级当前的斗争纲领，并且说明了在英国建设社会主义的长期任务。
    这项政治决议说：“代表大会是在这样的时候召开的，那就是英国资产阶级正在对工人阶级发动全面的进攻，企图使他们承受英国资产阶级本身的政策所造成的危机的全部负担。同时，保守党政府的基本外交政策正在急剧地加重核战争的危险，并且疯狂地向殖民地人民进攻。大选即将举行。”
    决议指出：“代表大会所面临的当前任务是加强反对保守党和雇主的斗争，维护和平，并创造政治条件，以便严重挫败保守党，并且随着共产党人当选议员而使工党重新执政。只要工人阶级和进步运动发挥他们的联合力量，他们就一定会取得胜利。
    决议谈到英国的经济情况时说，在过去两年中，资本主义世界的经济发生了决定性的变化，从而导致经济扩张和繁荣状态的结束。英国的经济有三年差不多处于停滞状态，最后出现了衰退。
    决议说：“在更为强大的帝国主义劲敌之前，英帝国主义者正在拚命加剧对殖民地的剥削，特别是对非洲的剥削，而在这个时候，民族解放运动已经发展到了一个完全新的阶段。保守党政府为了支付对殖民地人民的镇压措施和军事行动的费用，又把新的负担加在英国人民头上。”
    决议又指出，各资本主义国家共同经历的出口困难使他们之间的贸易战加剧，并且使帝国主义之间的矛盾加深，这可见于欧洲经济合作局，英、法、西德在共同市场问题上的争吵，以及英国同各自治领之间的日益紧张的关系中。英镑自由兑换的决定，也正在加剧这些矛盾。在英帝国主义比美国和西德软弱的情况下，这样做会使英镑受到更大的压力。
    决议在指出英国的这些经济困难以后说，随着新的技术进步，这种经济困难正在发展到严重的阶段。因此，社会生产力同保守党和雇主的目的之间的矛盾大大加剧了，保守党和雇主的目的是企图牺牲人民的工资、生活水平和消费来解决经济危机。
    这些情况已经表明，除了建立社会主义社会之外，英国人民的这些问题没有最后的解决办法。决议号召工人阶级采取紧急行动，并且提出一个制止衰退的当前纲领。关于和平、民族独立和社会主义问题，决议拿社会主义力量和民族解放斗争的巨大进展来对照帝国主义力量的衰落。决议还促请人们注意战争的危险。决议接着说，美国的代理人蒋介石继续霸占中国的领土台湾，美国海军赖在中国的海面，以及美国拒绝承认人民中国，这一切表明，美帝国主义者决心继续在远东保持紧张局势。
    决议着重指出，“核危险和国际紧张局势起源于西方的政策，这种政策是以核战略、北大西洋公约组织及与其并行的军事条约的侵略计划为基础的。和平斗争的当前目标应当是永久停止试验（核武器），阻止用核武器重新武装西德，在承认德意志民主共和国及拟订对德和约的情况下求得德国问题的和平解决。与此同时，应当重新展开新的全国性斗争来制止美国在英国建立火箭基地，撵走英国国土上的美国军队，并且恢复英国在军事上、经济上和政治上的真正独立。决议呼吁“和平运动和劳工运动的各个部分为了上述目标而团结一致。”
    决议说，“现在席卷中东、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动对争取世界和平和击败帝国主义正在作出巨大的贡献。这些意义深远的历史发展（其中又以万隆会议和阿克拉会议为高潮）改变了世界的形势，大大削弱了帝国主义及其推行发动世界战争和实行殖民统治的计划的能力。”
    决议接着说：“代表大会号召英国各阶层人民积极声援这些人民——已经取得政治独立和仍在为争取政治独立而斗争的人民。英国帝国主义和保守党主义是殖民地人民和英国人民的共同敌人，殖民地人民的每一个胜利和进展都有助于加强英国人民自己的斗争。”
    决议说，“代表大会向殖民地国家和前殖民地国家的共产党人致敬，他们站在本国人民解放斗争的最前线，设法团结一切反帝力量，以便迅速彻底地消灭帝国主义。在这些国家里，企图走危险的反共道路的任何作法，只能使解放运动分裂和削弱，以及推迟帝国主义的最后失败。
    决议最后指出：“我们的代表大会是正当社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性已愈来愈明显的时候召开的。甚至社会主义的敌人也认为社会主义的巨大进展是一个挑战。对于这样的挑战，资本主义并没有应战。社会主义是解决英国人民的种种问题的唯一的持久的办法。”
    决议说：“正是共产党在它的关于英国走向社会主义的道路这个纲领中指出了如何能够做到这一点。我们的全部力量都献给这一个目标。”
