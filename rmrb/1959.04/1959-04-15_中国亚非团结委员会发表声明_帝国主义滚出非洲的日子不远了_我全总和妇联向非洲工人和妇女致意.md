Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee today issued a statement on "Africa Freedom Day," the full text of which is as follows:
    The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee warmly responds to and supports the call of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council and the All-African People's Conference to hold "Africa Freedom Day" on April 15. This call expresses the strong desire of the broad masses of African people to strive for national independence and end colonial rule, and also reflects the common demand of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world to oppose imperialist aggression and safeguard world peace. The holding of "Africa Freedom Day" will further encourage and promote the victorious advancement of the African national independence movement.
    On December 1, 1958, on the eve of the All-African People's Conference, the people of Asian and African countries widely carried out the activity of "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," expressing their full support for the just struggle of the African people to strive for national independence and oppose colonialism. Since that time, the national independence movement in West Asia and Africa has been entering a new high tide with great momentum. The heroic Iraqi people have continuously achieved brilliant victories in the struggle against imperialist aggression and for safeguarding national independence, and recently smashed the subversive conspiracy of imperialist and domestic reactionary forces, and officially announced their withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact and the abolition of Britain's privileges to use the Habbaniyah Air Force Base; the Algerian people are victoriously carrying out an armed struggle against French imperialism; the people of Oman, the Congo, and Nyasaland, as well as other regions in Central Africa, have widely launched large-scale struggles against imperialist colonial rule, and the heroic struggle of the people in this vast region is developing vigorously. The entire African people have awakened, and their struggle is giving the imperialists a heavy blow, accelerating the final collapse of the colonial system, and the days of imperialism rolling out of Asia and Africa are not far off.
    However, imperialism, especially US imperialism, is carrying out new aggressive conspiracies in Asia and Africa. It is planning various forms of subversion and sabotage activities, splitting the Asian-African national independence movement and undermining the unity between Asian and African countries, attempting to replace British and French imperialism and continue to enslave and oppress the Asian and African people. However, the imperialists' conspiracies are doomed to failure. As long as the Asian and African people heighten their vigilance, unite as one on the basis of opposing imperialism, and persist in the struggle, they will surely be able to completely smash all imperialist aggressive conspiracies.
    The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the African people's struggle for national independence and against imperialism, and are willing to further develop the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of African countries, and support each other in the common struggle against imperialism. We believe that with the support of socialist countries and all peace-loving countries and people in the world, the African people, united and persistent in their struggle, will surely overcome difficulties, drive all imperialist aggressive forces out of Africa, and final victory will surely belong to the heroic African people who are fighting for national independence.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: On the eve of "Africa Freedom Day" on April 15th, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent telegrams and letters to seventeen African trade union organizations, representing Chinese workers to express support and respect to African workers and people who are bravely carrying out the anti-imperialist struggle.
    In telegrams sent to the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, the General Union of Algerian Workers, the Moroccan Labour Union, and the Tunisian General Labour Union, it was stated that the African workers and people's struggle for striving for and consolidating national independence, and opposing imperialism, has always been sincerely supported by our country and other socialist countries. At present, although the imperialists are using the conspiracy of Arabs fighting Arabs to obstruct or undermine the independence movement of the African people, we firmly believe that as long as the African people heighten their vigilance, strengthen unity, and persist in the struggle, with the support of the people of all countries in the world, they will surely be able to smash all the conspiracies of the imperialists, drive all colonialists out of Africa, and make all of Africa gain complete freedom and liberation.
    In telegrams and letters sent to the General Union of Black African Workers, the General Union of Workers of Equatorial Africa, the Guinea Trade Union Federation, the General Confederation of Labour of Cameroon, the General Confederation of Labour of Madagascar, the Ghana Trades Union Congress, the Nigeria Trades Union Congress, the Kenya Federation of Labour, the Uganda Trades Union Congress, the Nyasaland Trade Union Congress, the Northern Rhodesia Trade Union Congress, the Tanganyika Federation of Labour, and the South African Congress of Trade Unions, it was stated that at present, although the imperialists are still using their means of suppression and deceptive elections to obstruct the African people's independence movement, we firmly believe that as long as the African people strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, with the support of the people of all countries in the world, you will surely be able to drive all colonialists out of Africa, and make the entire Africa gain complete freedom and liberation. We wish this day will arrive soon.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The National Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China today sent a telegram to some African women's organizations, warmly supporting the holding of "Africa Freedom Day."
    The telegram from the National Women's Federation said: "We warmly support the call to designate April 15 as 'Africa Freedom Day,' which expresses the common demand of the broad masses of African people to strive for national independence and end colonial rule. The African people and women who have stood up, as long as they are united and persist in their struggle, will surely drive all imperialists out of the African continent. Victory and freedom will surely belong to you."
    The telegrams from the National Women's Federation were sent to the following women's organizations: the Arab Women's League, the Senegalese Women's League, the Ivory Coast Women's Committee, the Nigerian Women's Union, the Ghana National Women's Federation, the Algerian Women's League, the Sudanese Women's Association, the Sudanese Working Women's Committee (French Sudan), the Tunisian Women's Union, the Cameroon Democratic Women's Union, and the National Federation of Women of the United Arab Republic.

　　中国亚非团结委员会发表声明
　　帝国主义滚出非洲的日子不远了
　　我全总和妇联向非洲工人和妇女致意
    新华社14日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表关于“非洲自由日”的声明，全文如下：
    中国亚非团结委员会热烈响应和支持亚非人民团结理事会书记处和全非人民大会关于在4月15日举行“非洲自由日”的号召。这一号召表达了广大非洲人民争取民族独立和结束殖民主义统治的强烈愿望，也反映了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平的共同要求。“非洲自由日”的举行，将进一步鼓舞和推动非洲民族独立运动胜利前进。
    亚非各国人民在1958年12月1日，全非人民大会召开的前夕，曾广泛开展了“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的活动，表示全力支持非洲人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的正义斗争。从那个时候以来，西亚和非洲的民族独立运动正在以浩大的声势进入一个新的高潮。英勇的伊拉克人民在反对帝国主义侵略和维护民族独立的斗争中连续取得了辉煌的胜利，最近又粉碎了帝国主义和国内外反动势力的颠复阴谋，并正式宣布退出巴格达条约和废除英国利用哈巴尼雅空军基地的特权；阿尔及利亚人民正在胜利地进行着反对法帝国主义的武装斗争；阿曼、刚果和尼亚萨兰以及中非其他地区人民广泛掀起了规模宏大的反对帝国主义殖民统治的斗争，这个广大地区人民的英勇斗争正在如火如荼的向前发展。整个非洲人民已经觉醒，他们的斗争给帝国主义者以沉重的打击，加速着殖民体系的最后崩溃，帝国主义从亚洲、非洲滚出去的日子已经不远了。
    但是帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义正在亚洲和非洲进行着新的侵略阴谋，它策划各种形式的颠覆和破坏活动，分裂亚非民族独立运动和破坏亚非各国之间的团结，妄图代替英法帝国主义继续奴役和压迫亚非人民。但是，帝国主义的阴谋是注定要失败的，只要亚非人民加倍提高警惕，并在反对帝国主义的基础上团结一致，坚持斗争，必定能够彻底粉碎帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋。
    中国人民一贯同情和支持非洲人民争取民族独立、反对帝国主义的斗争，并愿进一步发展中国人民和非洲各国人民的友谊，在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中相互支持。我们相信，在社会主义国家和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，团结起来坚持斗争的非洲人民必定能克服困难，把一切帝国主义侵略势力从非洲赶出去，最后胜利必定属于为争取民族独立而斗争的英勇的非洲人民。
    新华社14日讯　中华全国总工会在4月15日“非洲自由日”前夕，分别打电报和寄信给非洲十七个工会组织，代表中国职工向英勇进行反帝斗争的非洲工人和人民表示支持和敬意。
    在发给阿拉伯工会国际联合会、阿尔及利亚工人总联合会、摩洛哥劳工联合会和突尼斯工人总联合会的电报中说，非洲工人和人民争取和巩固民族独立以及反对帝国主义的斗争，一向受到我国和其他社会主义国家的真诚支持。目前尽管帝国主义者正在用阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人的阴谋来阻挠或破坏非洲人民的独立运动，但我们深信，只要非洲人民提高警惕、加强团结、坚持斗争，在世界各国人民的支持下，他们一定能够粉碎帝国主义者的一切阴谋，把所有殖民主义者驱逐出非洲，使全非洲获得彻底的自由和解放。
    在发给黑非洲工人总联合会、赤道非洲工人总联合会、几内亚工会联合会、喀麦隆总工会、马达加斯加总工会、加纳工会大会、尼日利亚工会大会、怯尼亚劳工联合会、乌干达工会大会、尼亚萨兰工会大会、北罗得西亚工会大会、坦噶尼喀劳工联合会及南非工会大会的电报和信中说，目前，尽管帝国主义者仍在用其镇压手段与欺骗性选举来阻挠非洲人民的独立运动，但我们深信，只要非洲人民加强团结坚持斗争，在世界各国人民的支持下，你们一定能够把所有殖民主义者驱逐出非洲，使整个非洲获得彻底的自由与解放。我们预祝这一天早日到来。
    新华社14日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天致电非洲一些妇女组织，热烈支持“非洲自由日”的举行。
    全国妇联的电报说：“我们热烈支持把4月15日定为‘非洲自由日’的号召，它表达了广大非洲人民争取民族独立和结束殖民主义统治的共同要求。站起来了的非洲人民和妇女，只要团结一致，坚持斗争，一定会把帝国主义从非洲大陆上全部赶出去。胜利和自由一定属于你们。”
    全国妇联的电报是发给下面这些妇女组织的：阿拉伯妇女联盟、塞内加尔妇女联盟、象牙海岸妇女委员会、尼日利亚妇女联盟、加纳全国妇女联合会、阿尔及利亚妇女联盟、苏丹妇女协会、苏丹劳动妇女委员会（法属苏丹）、突尼斯妇女联合会、喀麦隆民主妇女联盟、阿联妇女全国联合会。
