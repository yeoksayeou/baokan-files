Comrades Chairman, and Esteemed Committee Members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1958 National Financial Statement and the Draft National Budget for 1959," the Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and the Work Report of the Standing Committee by Vice Chairman Li Weihan; and I pledge to resolutely implement their directives in my future work.

Over the past year, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, China's water conservancy and hydropower construction has achieved great successes, ushering in an unprecedented leap forward.

In 1958, according to incomplete statistics, water conservancy construction completed 58 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, 8.2 times that of the First Five-Year Plan period; the irrigated area increased from 520 million mu in 1957 to 1 billion mu, expanding the irrigated area by 480 million mu, 2.2 times the expansion during the First Five-Year Plan, and twice the 240 million mu of irrigated land in old China over thousands of years. In 1958, the hydropower capacity put into production totaled 200,000 kilowatts. Not only were some large-scale projects built that year, but according to incomplete statistics, local and mass-run medium-sized projects completed 3,303 sites. Now, on the basis of the great leap forward of 1958, we are continuing to exert ourselves to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in water conservancy and hydropower construction in 1959. The scale of water conservancy and hydropower construction in 1959 will have a greater increase than in 1958. The total hydropower capacity planned to be put into production throughout the year will be over 500,000 kilowatts. Water conservancy and hydropower projects such as the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station in Zhejiang Province (with an installed capacity of 652,500 kilowatts) and the Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station in Guangdong Province (with an installed capacity of 290,000 kilowatts) will begin generating electricity this year. In addition, many large, medium, and small reservoirs will be built across the country, with a total water storage capacity of nearly 100 billion cubic meters; soil and water conservation will be completed in an area of about 200,000 square kilometers; and the irrigated area will be increased by about 100 million mu.

Over the past year, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and on the basis of the victory of a series of socialist revolutionary movements such as rectification and anti-rightist campaigns, we have vigorously launched mass movements and technical revolutions, resulting in a nationwide upsurge in water conservancy and hydropower construction. Water conservancy and hydropower builders, each with soaring enthusiasm, worked hard, practically, and ingeniously, completing a large number of arduous engineering tasks. For example, the builders of the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, inspired by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, created a new record of pouring 9,425 cubic meters of concrete per day; the builders of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project victoriously cut off the rolling Yellow River, forcing it all to pass through man-made structures; the people of Gansu are now carrying out the unprecedentedly large-scale Yintao Project, splitting more than 200 towering mountains and crossing more than 1,500 large and small river valleys and gullies, diverting the Tao River up the mountains, irrigating 15 million mu of farmland, generating 500,000 kilowatts of electricity, and allowing navigation of 20 to 100-ton ships, in order to realize the canalization, reservoirization and systematization of water conservancy in mountainous areas. In terms of design and construction, advanced construction methods such as large-scale blasting for earth and stone excavation (excavating tens of thousands of cubic meters at a time), underwater dumping for earth dam construction (saving compaction equipment and a large amount of manpower, and speeding up construction progress), directional blasting for building rockfill dams (instantaneously flying more than 100,000 cubic meters of stones to the designated location to form a dam body), and large-block concrete pouring (pouring at a height of 45 meters at a time, with a maximum area of 708 square meters and a total concrete volume of 15,000 cubic meters) have also been adopted and promoted, greatly accelerating the progress of the project and reducing the cost of the project. In the past, it took more than five years to build a 500,000 to 1 million kilowatt hydropower station, but now it can be built in just two and a half to three years; the cost of the project has been reduced by half or more than half compared to the past. Through the practice of the First Five-Year Plan and 1958, we have more clearly seen that under the special favorable conditions for actively developing water resources in our country, the long-term construction policy of "water as the main and fire as the auxiliary" for China's electric power industry put forward by the Party is completely correct.

Now, as a water conservancy and hydropower builder, I would like to express my personal opinions on this issue:

First, China's water resources are extremely abundant. According to the latest surveys, the total hydropower reserves in the country, calculated according to average flow, are 580 million kilowatts, and if tidal power is included, it can exceed 600 million kilowatts. These resources are distributed throughout the country, which is convenient for industrial and agricultural electricity use in various regions, and the development conditions are particularly favorable. We not only have extremely superior natural conditions, but according to the practice of our country's First Five-Year Plan and 1958, it shows that the speed of hydropower construction can be greatly accelerated and can keep up with the situation of the Great Leap Forward. For example, the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, with an installed capacity of 652,500 kilowatts, can be built and generate electricity in just three years; the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station on the Yellow River, with an installed capacity of 1.05 million kilowatts, can be built and generate electricity in two and a half years; the Yanguoxia Hydropower Station on the Yellow River, with an installed capacity of 658,000 kilowatts, can be built and generate electricity in just one and a half years. In terms of cost, hydropower and thermal power can also be roughly equal, and the cost of some large hydropower stations may even be lower than that of thermal power.

Second, the development of water resources in our country has the benefit of comprehensive utilization. Hydropower construction is closely combined with flood control, irrigation, and navigation, and they are mutually promoting. For example, the Guanting, Sanmenxia, Danjiangkou, and Miyun projects are all comprehensively utilized projects that bring comprehensive and long-term benefits to the national economy. Last year, the merger of the original Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Electric Power further solved the problem of the combination of water conservancy and electric power from the organizational level, which is completely conducive to promoting the development of hydropower construction in the future.

Third, hydropower has low cost and safe operation. Hydropower does not require coal fuel, so the cost is naturally low. Compared with thermal power, it is only one-fifth to one-tenth of its cost. Hydropower stations consume less electricity themselves, are flexible to start during operation, and rarely experience accidents. In addition, less steel is required for the manufacture of hydropower equipment, and high-quality steel is not required. Some parts can also be replaced with cast iron. The supporting equipment is relatively simple, and medium-sized units can also be manufactured locally. Not only do hydropower stations require less steel for unit equipment, but also relatively less steel for infrastructure construction.

Of course, hydropower also has its certain shortcomings, such as the location of hydropower stations is generally a little far from the power consumption center, and the power generation is less in dry years. However, if it is not just an isolated hydropower station or there is no reservoir regulation, but in conjunction with other hydropower and thermal power, or in the case of reservoir regulation, even if it is a dry year, it will not cause great difficulties.

Therefore, on a national scale, from a long-term perspective, and especially from the overall interests of the national economy, the principle of "water as the main and fire as the auxiliary" should be actively implemented in the construction of the electric power industry. In places where it is possible and necessary to develop hydropower, that is, in places where water resources are abundant or coal is difficult to balance, such as the many provinces in Southwest, East China, Central China, South China, and Northwest China, hydropower should be developed more actively. All large, medium, and small water conservancy projects in various places should be combined with power generation as much as possible if they can generate electricity.

Water conservancy and hydropower projects are large in scale and require a lot of materials, especially cement. According to the current national material production and supply situation, in order to carry out water conservancy and hydropower construction more, faster, better, and more economically, the following suggestions are put forward:

1.  Water conservancy and hydropower projects should boldly innovate dam types. Wherever local natural conditions and construction conditions allow the use of local materials to build dams, local material dams, such as earth dams, rockfill dams, and earth-rock mixed dams, should be used as much as possible. According to past data, local material dams can save 40% to 80% or more cement than concrete gravity dams, and can also appropriately reduce steel. If local natural conditions and construction conditions do not allow the use of local material dams and concrete dams must be used, research should also be conducted on the use of lightweight concrete dams (such as arch dams, multiple arch dams, flat slab dams, buttress dams, wide-joint or hollow gravity dams, etc.), and reasonable measures should be taken in design and construction to save steel and cement. While innovating dam types, attention should also be paid to the use of new construction methods, such as large-block concrete pouring, large-scale blasting for earth and stone excavation, underwater dumping for dam construction, and directional blasting for dam construction, in order to speed up construction progress and save materials.

2.  Combining foreign and indigenous methods and relying on our own efforts is a way to solve the current shortage of building materials and construction equipment. It is recommended that each province, special region with a large task, and large construction unit, according to local conditions, plan to build or expand one to several small or medium-sized cement plants, explosives plants, and construction equipment manufacturing plants. The nature and scale can be determined according to the specific conditions of each place. The method of building factories should be indigenous first and then foreign, with indigenous methods as the main and combining indigenous and foreign methods, so that it is easy to achieve the goal of self-reliance.

3.  The complete supply of water turbine generator sets is a prominent problem in the current hydropower construction. More than 100,000 kilowatts of hydropower stations built last year could not be installed and generate electricity due to incomplete sets of units. Civil engineering of hydropower stations built in many places has been completed, but they cannot generate electricity due to the lack of units. It is hoped that the machinery manufacturing departments will assist in solving this problem.

Comrades! Water conservancy and hydropower construction has made great progress in the past year. We have the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the guidance of the correct principles of the Central Committee on water conservancy and hydropower construction, the leadership of Party committees at all levels, and the cooperation of all parties. Through the joint efforts of all water conservancy and hydropower builders, water conservancy and hydropower construction will surely achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, and will surely complete and overfulfill the glorious water conservancy and hydropower construction tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state.

    水电建设在大踏步前进
    黄育贤委员的发言主席、诸位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告和李维汉副主席的常务委员会工作报告；并表示在今后的工作中坚决贯彻执行他们的指示。
    我国的水利水电建设一年来在党的总路线的光辉照耀下取得了很大的成绩，出现了一个空前跃进的局面。
    一九五八年在水利建设方面据不完全的统计，共完成土石方五百八十亿公方，为第一个五年计划期间的八点二倍；灌溉面积由一九五七年的五点二亿亩，增加到十亿亩，扩大灌溉面积四点八亿亩，为第一个五年计划期间扩大灌溉面积的二点二倍，为旧中国几千年来灌溉面积二点四亿亩的二倍。一九五八年在水电建设方面投入生产的水电容量共有二十万瓩。这一年不仅修建了一些大型工程，据不完全统计，地方和群众自办的中型工程即完成了三千三百零三处。现在我们正在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，为一九五九年水利水电建设更大、更好、更全面的跃进而努力。一九五九年水利水电建设的规模比一九五八年将有更大的增长。全年计划投入生产的水电容量将在五十万瓩以上。像浙江省的新安江水电站（装机容量为六十五万二千五百瓩），广东省的新丰江水电站（装机容量为二十九万瓩）等水利水电工程都将在今年内开始发电。此外，全国各地将建成许多大、中、小型水库，蓄水总容量将近一千亿公方；完成水土保持面积在二十万平方公里左右；增加灌溉面积约一亿亩。
    一年来，我们在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在整风反右等一系列的社会主义革命运动胜利的基础上，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，出现了全民办水利水电的高潮。水利水电建设者们，个个干劲冲天，苦干实干巧干，完成了大量艰巨的工程任务。如新安江水电站的建设者们，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，创造了每天浇捣混凝土九千四百二十五公方的新纪录；三门峡水利工程的建设者们，胜利地截断了滚滚的黄河大流，迫使它全部通过人为的建筑物；甘肃人民现正进行着史无前例的巨大的引洮工程，劈开丛山峻岭二百余座，跨过大小河谷、沟涧一千五百余处，引洮水上山，灌田一千五百万亩，发电五十万瓩，通航二十到一百吨的船只，以实现山区渠网库塘化、水利系统化。在设计和施工方面，也采用和推广了如大爆破开挖土石方（一次开挖数万公方）、水中倒土修筑土坝（节省碾压设备和大量人力，加快施工进度）、定向爆破建筑堆石坝（将十余万公方石块瞬息间飞到指定地点堆成坝体）、大块浇筑混凝土（一次浇筑高四十五公尺，最大面积七百零八平方公尺，混凝土总量达一万五千公方）等先进的施工方法，大大加快了工程进度，降低了工程造价。过去一个五十到一百万瓩的水电站，要五年以上的时间才能建成，现在只要两年半到三年就可以建成了；工程造价比过去降低了一半或一半以上。通过第一个五年计划和一九五八年的实践，我们更清楚地看到了在我国积极开发水力资源的特殊有利条件下，党提出的我国电力工业“水主火辅”的长期建设方针是完全正确的。
    现在，我想以一个水利水电建设者的身份，就这个问题谈一下个人的意见：
    第一、我国水力资源十分丰富。根据最近的调查，全国水力资源蕴藏量按平均流量计算有五点八亿瓩，如果包括潮汐水力则可超过六亿瓩，这些资源分布全国各地，便于各地区工农业用电，而且开发条件特别优越。我们不仅具有极其优越的自然条件，根据我国第一个五年计划和一九五八年的实践，说明水电建设的速度可以大大加快，能够跟上大跃进的形势。例如新安江水电站装机容量六十五万二千五百瓩，只要三年即可建成发电；黄河刘家峡水电站装机容量一百零五万瓩，两年半即可建成发电；黄河盐锅峡水电站装机容量六十五万八千瓩，则只要一年半的时间即可建成发电。造价方面水电与火电也可以大体相等，个别大型水电站的造价可能比火电还要低。
    第二、我国水力资源的开发，具有综合利用的效益。水电建设与防洪、灌溉、航运等是密切结合，又是互相促进的，如官厅、三门峡、丹江口、密云等工程都是综合利用为国民经济带来全面的、长远利益的工程。去年原水利和电力两部合并后，更从组织上解决了水利与电力结合的问题，这完全有利于推动今后水电建设的发展。
    第三、水电成本低，运行安全。水电不需要煤炭燃料，成本自然低廉，如与火电对比，只有它的五分之一到十分之一。水电站本身消耗的电量少，运转中起动灵活，很少发生事故。此外，水电设备制造需用的钢材少，也不需要优质钢材，有些部件还可以用铸铁代替，配套比较简单，中型机组地方也可以制造。水电站不仅机组设备需用钢材少，基建所用的钢材也比较少。
    当然，水电也有它一定的缺点，如水电站的位置一般都距用电中心稍远，运行上遇到枯水年发电量少。但如果不只是一个孤立的水电站或不是无水库调节，而在有其他水电和火电配合，或者有水库调节的情况下，即使遇到枯水年也不会造成很大困难。
    因此，在全国范围内，从长远打算，特别是从国民经济的全面利益出发，在电力工业建设上应当积极贯彻“水主火辅”的方针。在可能和必须发展水电的地方，即水力资源丰富或煤炭难以平衡的地方，如西南、华东、华中、华南及西北的许多省，应当更积极的发展水电。各地的大中小型水利工程，凡能发电的都应当尽量结合发电。
    水利水电工程规模较大，所需的材料很多，特别是水泥较多，根据当前国家材料生产和供应情况，为了多、快、好、省地进行水利水电建设，特提出以下几点意见：
    一、水利水电工程应当大胆革新坝型，凡当地自然条件和施工条件可能采用当地材料筑坝的，应当尽量采用当地材料坝，如土坝、堆石坝、土石混合坝等。根据以往资料，当地材料坝比混凝土重力坝可以节省水泥百分之四十到百分之八十以上，同时还可以适当减少钢材。如果当地自然条件和施工条件不能采用当地材料坝而必须采用混凝土坝时，也应当研究采用轻型混凝土坝（如拱坝、连拱坝、平板坝、大头坝、宽缝或空心重力坝等），并在设计和施工中注意采取合理措施，节约钢材水泥。在革新坝型的同时，还应当注意采用新的施工方法，如大块混凝土浇筑、大爆破开挖土石方、水中倒土筑坝和定向爆破筑坝等，以加快施工进度，节约材料。
    二、洋土并举、自力更生是解决当前建筑材料和施工设备不足的一个途径，建议每个省、任务较大的专区和大的工程单位，根据当地条件，有计划地兴建或扩建一个到几个小型或中型的水泥厂、炸药厂和施工设备制造厂，性质和规模可根据各地具体情况而定。建厂的方式，宜先土后洋，以土为主，土洋结合，这样就容易达到自力更生的目的。
    三、水轮发电机组的成套供应，是当前水电建设中一个突出的问题。去年建成的水电站由于机组不成套不能安装发电的即有十万瓩以上。许多地方兴建的水电站土建工程已经完工，由于没有机组也不能发电，希望机械制造部门协助解决。
    同志们！一年来水利水电建设有了很大的发展，我们有了一九五八年大跃进的经验，有中央关于水利水电建设的正确方针的指导，在各级党委的领导下，在各方面的协作下，经过全体水利水电建设者的共同努力，水利水电建设在一九五九年一定能够取得更大、更好、更全面的跃进，一定能够完成和超额完成党和国家交给我们的光荣的水利水电建设任务。
