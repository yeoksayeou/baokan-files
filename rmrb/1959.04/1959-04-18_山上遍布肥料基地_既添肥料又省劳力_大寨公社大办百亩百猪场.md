　　Dazhai Commune Runs Large-Scale Hundred-Mu Hundred-Pig Farms
    This newspaper reports that the people of Dazhai People's Commune (formerly Zhongshan Township), Qin'an County, Gansu Province, have created an advanced experience in developing pig production at high speed: running hundred-mu hundred-pig farms in high mountains and deep bays. According to the local characteristics of large mountains, remote bays, dispersed cultivated land, and difficult transportation, a breeding farm with about a hundred pigs is set up in every hundred mu or so of cultivated land as a fertilizer base, so that each mu of land has a pig to accumulate fertilizer for it all year round; at the same time, 25 mu of cultivated land is taken from every hundred mu of land to grow feed (one mu of feed plus wild grass, bran, and chaff can feed four pigs). This makes pig raising and crop growing mutually dependent and supportive. This method can also save a lot of labor for transporting fertilizer and invest it in other aspects of production.
    Dazhai People's Commune is located in the cold mountainous area of southern Gansu. The territory is full of overlapping mountains and ravines, without a single mu of flat land; the altitude is between 1,700 meters and 2,100 meters. The township has more than 24,000 mu of cultivated land, but only 3,400 full and semi-laborers. The mountains are barren, there is little grass, and feed is lacking. There has never been a habit of raising pigs. Due to the large amount of land, the lack of labor, and the lack of fertilizer, the farming has always been extensive, the yield is low, and the people's lives are extremely poor. Since liberation, although there has been great improvement year by year, the grain yield per mu in 1957 was only 137 jin. The 1,200 households in the township had only 735 pigs. In April 1958, the Zhongshan Township Party Committee, during an inspection, discovered that Yuanjia Village, which was originally the poorest in the township, had vigorously developed pig raising in 1957, and each household earned more than 100 yuan a year just from raising pigs. With more pigs and more fertilizer, the grain output rose linearly, and it became the richest village in the township, with savings in every household and surplus grain in every household. The Township Party Committee used this vivid teaching material to educate the people of the township to vigorously develop pig raising. After four months of practice and summary, a complete set of pig-raising experience of "commune and team as the main force, going up the mountains and into the bays, and running large-scale hundred-mu hundred-pig farms" was formed.
    This method was warmly welcomed by the farmers as soon as it appeared. The commune has now set up 54 pig farms. In 1958, a total of 6,298 pigs were raised (a small number of which were raised privately by commune members), averaging 5.1 pigs per household. This is an increase of 5,563 pigs compared with the 735 pigs at the end of 1957, or about 7.4 times. Since the establishment of the farms, the advantages have been prominently shown in the following four aspects:
    First, it has provided a lot of good fertilizer for agriculture. In half a year, more than 6,200 pigs have accumulated more than 710,000 dan of fertilizer, which was applied to more than 8,900 mu of land in autumn (accounting for 36% of the township's cultivated land area). The average yield per mu of these lands increased by 86% compared with 1957.
    Second, it saves a lot of labor and puts it into various productions such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. Dazhai Commune has large mountains, steep slopes, and dispersed cultivated land, and the land is far from the villages. After the establishment of hundred-mu hundred-pig farms last year, the pig farms were dotted in the middle of the fields, and the fertilizer was conveniently delivered to the fields by the pig farm breeders, which alone saved more than 110,000 labor days. In addition, because the pig farms are located in the mountains and bays, they can harvest feed and fuel and collect soil to pad the pens nearby. The 54 pig farms in the commune have reduced the number of breeders by 108. After the large amount of labor saved was invested in other work, the commune's agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery production all showed a new look of rapid progress.
    Third, it is in line with the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily. Building farms on the mountains, in the bays, and in the fields allows for the selection of cave dwellings as pig houses in places that are sheltered from the wind, sunny, dry, and close to water sources. This kind of pig house not only does not require building materials such as bricks, tiles, rafters, and beams, but is also warm in winter and cool in summer. The dispersion of pig farms can also reduce epidemics.
    Fourth, it is in line with the principle of combining self-sufficient production and commodity production. With the large increase in pigs, in addition to the fact that commune members can often eat pork, the state's purchase plan has been overfulfilled by 92%.
    Now Dazhai People's Commune plans to build another 46 pig farms to reach 100 farms, raising a total of 15,000 pigs; sell 3,000 fat pigs to the state within the year, and support fraternal communes with 4,000 piglets. In terms of feeding management, in addition to continuing to promote and improve the effective classification and grouping management, feeding with grass instead of grain, improving varieties, and epidemic prevention systems, it has been decided to implement a pig breeding archive system to gradually realize the scientificization of pig production.
    At a pig production conference, the CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee focused on promoting the experience of the Dazhai Commune's hundred-mu hundred-pig farm, and put forward the slogan "Vigorously Carry Out the Hundred-Mu Hundred-Pig Farm Movement" to the more than 3 million people in the entire prefecture. It is required that through the hundred-mu hundred-pig farm movement, the number of pigs will increase from 410,000 at the beginning of the year to 1.5 million by the end of the year, and fertilizer bases will be established for 1.5 million mu of cultivated land.

### 山上遍布肥料基地　既添肥料又省劳力  大寨公社大办百亩百猪场

　　山上遍布肥料基地　既添肥料又省劳力
　　大寨公社大办百亩百猪场
    本报讯　甘肃省秦安县大寨人民公社（原中山乡）人民，创造了一种高速度发展生猪生产的先进经验——在高山深湾大办百亩百猪场。根据当地山大湾远、耕地分散、运输困难的特点，在每一百亩左右耕地中办一个有猪百口左右的饲养场，作为肥料基地，使每一亩地有一口猪为它常年积肥；同时从每一百亩田地中退耕二十五亩种饲料（一亩饲料加上野草、糠麸、秕子等能养四口猪）。使养猪和种庄稼互相依存互相支援。这个办法还可以节省大量运送肥料的劳动力投入其他方面的生产。
    大寨人民公社位于陇南高寒山区。境内山峦重叠，沟壑纵横，没有一亩川地；海拔在一千七百公尺到两千一百公尺间。全乡二万四千多亩耕地，只有三千四百个全半劳动力。山秃草少饲料缺乏，向来没有养猪习惯。由于地多劳力少又缺肥料，历来耕作粗放，产量低微，人民生活极为贫困。解放以来，虽然逐年有很大改善，但1957年粮食亩产量还只有一百三十七斤。全乡一千二百户只有猪七百三十五口。1958年4月，中山乡党委在检查工作中，发现原来全乡最穷的袁家村由于在1957年大力发展了养猪事业，每户全年光养猪就收入了一百多元。猪多肥料也多，粮食产量随着直线上升，因而一跃成为家家有存款、户户有余粮的全乡最富裕的村庄。乡党委就以这个活生生的教材，教育全乡人民大力发展养猪事业。经过四个月的实践和总结，形成了一套完整的“社队为主，上山进湾，大办百亩百猪场”的养猪经验。
    这个方法一出现就受到了农民的热烈欢迎。全社现已办起猪场五十四座，1958年共养猪六千二百九十八口（其中有一少部分是社员私人喂养的），每户平均五点一口。比1957年底实有猪七百三十五口增加了五千五百六十三口，约七点四倍。建场以来，突出地在以下四方面显示了优越性：
    一、为农业提供了很多很好的肥料。半年来六千二百多口猪共积肥七十一万多担，秋季施在八千九百多亩地里（占全乡耕地面积的36％）。这些地一季的平均亩产量就比1957年增加了86％。
    二、节省大量劳动力，投入农林牧副渔等各项生产。大寨公社山大坡陡，耕地分散，土地距离村庄较远。去年办起百亩百猪场后，猪场星罗棋布地遍设在田地中间，肥料全由猪场的饲养员顺便送到地里，只此一项就节省了十一万多个劳动日。此外，由于猪场设在山上湾里，可以就近收割饲料燃料和取土垫圈，全社五十四个猪场，减少了饲养员一百零八人。节省的大量劳动力投入其他工作后，使公社的农林牧副渔各项生产都出现了突飞猛进的崭新面貌。
    三、符合勤俭办社的原则。在山上湾里田间建场，可以就地选择避风、向阳、干燥、近水源的地方挖窑洞作猪舍。这种猪舍不仅不用砖瓦椽梁等建筑材料，还冬暖夏凉。猪场分散，又能减少疫病。
    四、符合自给性生产和商品生产同时并举的方针。随着生猪的大量增加，除社员们能经常吃到猪肉外，还超额92％完成了国家的收购计划。
    现在大寨人民公社计划再增建四十六个猪场，达到一百个场，共繁养生猪一万五千口；年内卖给国家肥猪三千口，支援兄弟社仔猪四千口。在饲养管理方面，除继续推广和健全行之有效的分类分群管理、以草代粮喂养、改良品种和防疫等制度外，决定推行生猪饲养档案制，逐步实现生猪生产科学化。
    中共天水地委在一次生猪生产会议上，着重推广了大寨公社百亩百猪场的经验，向全专区三百多万人民提出了“大力开展百亩百猪场运动”的口号。要求通过百亩百猪场运动，使生猪数量由年初的四十一万口到年底增加到一百五十万口，并为一百五十万亩耕地建立肥料基地。　（柳梆、孙民）
