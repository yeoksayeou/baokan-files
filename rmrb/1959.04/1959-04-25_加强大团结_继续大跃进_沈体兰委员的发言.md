Presidium, fellow committee members, comrades:

This first plenary session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is being held in the capital, and all committee members have also attended the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. This conference brings together representatives of all ethnic groups and social strata from all over the country, demonstrating that this is a conference of great unity of all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic人士 in the country. It is also a conference to mobilize the people of the whole country to achieve a continued Great Leap Forward this year.

I completely agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan and suggest that the conference adopt this report. After listening to the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, the report on the draft of the 1959 National Economic Plan made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and the report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, I completely agree and sincerely support them, and suggest that the conference adopt corresponding resolutions. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the Chinese people have strengthened the great unity within all ethnic groups, and under the brilliant guidance of the general line for socialist construction, have achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in all fronts of industrial and agricultural production, capital construction, transportation, commerce, culture and education. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the soaring enthusiasm of the working people, and the superior socialist system, China will continue to achieve even greater leaps forward on the basis of the great achievements it has made in 1958.

I sincerely support the policies and measures of the Central People's Government for handling the Tibetan rebellion as explained by Premier Zhou Enlai in his Government Work Report. I fully agree with the solemn policy of the Central Government to safeguard the unity of the motherland, strengthen national unity, and oppose imperialism and all reactionaries from infringing upon our country's territorial sovereignty and interfering in our internal affairs; as well as the brilliant measures to develop national regional autonomy, ensure freedom of religious belief, and build a democratic and socialist new Tibet. I warmly congratulate the people of the whole country and the people of Tibet for swiftly quelling the Tibetan rebellion under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and exposing and defeating the vicious conspiracies of reactionary elements at home and abroad. I believe that while the people of the whole country should be highly vigilant and vigorously counterattack the heinous actions of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in instigating and encouraging the Tibetan rebellion, we must also resolutely oppose the Indian expansionists who openly support the Tibetan rebellion and spread absurd remarks that are hostile to and slander our country. Recently, after the Tibetan rebel group hijacked the Dalai Lama into Indian territory, Indian diplomatic officials even distributed a so-called statement by the Dalai Lama. This provocative behavior is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. We must solemnly warn them: Tibet will always be the Tibet of the Chinese people, and no foreigners are allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs. If the Indian reactionaries continue to develop their shameful actions and fail to rein in their horses before it is too late, then they must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences of damaging friendly relations between China and India, supporting imperialism, expanding aggression, creating tensions, and undermining peace in Southeast Asia!

Now, the people of all ethnic groups in our country are united more closely than ever around the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and this conference is a powerful proof of this. In order to continue to strive for a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward this year, it is necessary to further strengthen unity, constantly resolve contradictions among the people, and constantly adjust relations among the people, so as to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all the people and greatly unleash productive potential to build socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results. At the same time, in order to consolidate and expand the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, it is also necessary to further mobilize all positive factors, develop productive forces at high speed, promote soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, and cultivate a down-to-earth work style, so as to unite the people of all ethnic groups more closely in the socialist family of close friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation in the form of a people's democratic united front with the formula of unity—criticism—unity. 1959 will surely be a year of great unity and great leap forward for the Chinese people, ushering in the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great motherland.

Under the wise leadership of the Party's policy of unity, education, and transformation, intellectuals have made great progress in their political awareness and ideological understanding, and have made many contributions to the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. However, in order to better serve the socialist Great Leap Forward, we must unite more closely, unite more closely around the Party and the government, and become more closely integrated with the workers and peasants to strengthen the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. We must accelerate the fundamental self-transformation, more sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, more actively take the socialist road, summon up our courage, strive for the upper reaches, and better serve the people of the whole country. We must strengthen transformation and actively serve. Under the leadership of the Party and the supervision of the masses, we must strive to become both red and expert working-class intellectuals and contribute all our strength to the socialist Great Leap Forward.

Under the leadership of the Party, the National Committee of the CPPCC and local committees have done a lot of work and have played an important role in strengthening the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, mobilizing all positive factors, and serving the socialist Great Leap Forward. With the rapid advance of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the CPPCC must strengthen political consultation and political activities to further enrich and enrich the national political life; must oppose imperialist aggression, strengthen international peace and friendship, and safeguard the security of the motherland and world peace; must strengthen the people's democratic united front, promote the self-transformation of all democratic parties and democratic人士, and promote all democratic人士 to actively participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, strengthen unity and strive for a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward.

I wish the conference a successful conclusion and all committee members good health!

    加强大团结　继续大跃进
    沈体兰委员的发言主席团、各位委员、各位同志：
    这次政协第三届全国委员会第一次全体会议在首都召开，全体委员又列席了第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议。大会集合了全国各地的各个民族的各个社会阶层的代表人物，表明这是一个全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其他爱国民主人士大团结的大会，也是一个动员全国人民实现今年继续大跃进的大会。
    我完全同意李维汉副主席所作的政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告并建议大会通过这个报告。听了周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，李富春副总理所作的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理所作的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，我完全同意，衷心拥护，并建议大会通过相应的决议。中国人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，加强了各民族人民内部的大团结，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，实现了史无前例的工农业生产、基本建设、运输、商业、文化教育等各个战线上的大跃进。由于共产党的正确领导，劳动人民的冲天干劲，以及社会主义的优越制度，我国在一九五八年所取得巨大成就的基础上，必将继续获得更大的跃进。
    我竭诚拥护周恩来总理在政府工作报告中所说明的中央人民政府处理西藏叛乱问题的政策和措施：完全同意中央维护祖国统一，加强民族团结，反对帝国主义和一切反动派侵犯我国领土主权、干涉我国内政的严正政策；以及发展民族区域自治，保障宗教信仰自由，和建设民主的、社会主义的新西藏的英明措施。我热烈祝贺全国人民和西藏人民，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，迅速平定了西藏叛乱，揭露和击破了国内外反动派的毒辣阴谋。我认为全国人民对美帝和蒋匪帮策动和鼓励西藏叛乱的罪恶行动，固然应该提高警惕，猛力反击，但对印度扩张主义分子，公然支持西藏叛乱，散播敌视和诬蔑我国的荒谬言论，也要坚决反对。最近西藏叛乱集团劫持达赖喇嘛进入印度国境以后，印度外交官员竟散发所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，这种挑衅行为是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。我们要严正地警告他们：西藏永远是中国人的西藏，不许任何外国人干涉中国内政，如果印度反动派继续发展他们的可耻行为，再不悬崖勒马，那末他们必须对由此而产生的损害中印友好邦交，声援帝国主义扩大侵略制造紧张局势和破坏东南亚和平的一切严重后果，负全部的责任！
    现在，我国各民族人民，空前紧密地团结在中国共产党和中央人民政府周围，这次大会就是一个有力的证明。为了继续在今年争取更大更好更全面的跃进，必须进一步加强团结，不断地解决人民内部矛盾，不断地调整人民内部关系，从而充分地调动全体人民的积极性，大大地发挥生产潜力，多快好省地建设社会主义。同时，为了巩固和扩大各民族人民的团结，又必须进一步调动一切积极因素，高速度发展生产力，发扬冲天的革命干劲，培养踏实的工作作风，从而以人民民主统一战线的形式，团结——批评——团结的公式，把各民族人民更紧密地团结在亲密友爱、互助合作的社会主义大家庭中。一九五九年必将成为中国人民大团结、大跃进，迎接伟大祖国国庆十周年的一年。
    知识分子在党的团结、教育、改造政策的英明领导下，政治觉悟和思想认识都有了很多进步，对社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业作出了不少贡献。但要更好地为社会主义大跃进服务，我们必须更紧密地团结起来，更紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，更密切地与工农群众打成一片，来加强全国各民族人民的团结。我们必须加速进行根本自我改造，更真诚地接受党的领导，更积极地走社会主义道路，鼓足干劲，力争上游，更好地为全国人民服务。我们要加强改造，积极服务，要在党的领导和群众的监督下，力争成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，为社会主义大跃进贡献所有的力量。
    政协全国委员会和各地方委员会，在党的领导下，已经做了许多工作，对于加强全国各民族人民的团结，调动一切积极因素，为社会主义大跃进服务，发挥了重要的作用。随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的飞跃前进，政协必须加强政治协商和政治活动，进一步充实和丰富国家政治生活；必须反对帝国主义侵略，加强国际和平友好，保卫祖国安全和世界和平；必须加强人民民主统一战线，推动各民主党派和民主人士进行自我改造，推动各界民主人士积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设。让我们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，加强团结，争取更大更好更全面的跃进。
    祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康！
