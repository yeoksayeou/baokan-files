Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 14th: Our correspondent reports: Since entering the second quarter, a new batch of factories, schools, and residential construction projects have begun in North Vietnam. After holding "Work Summary Meetings" and "Labor Model Conferences" for the first quarter, tens of thousands of workers at various construction sites are now redoubling their efforts and plunging into the second quarter battle.

According to statistics from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction, eleven projects were completed in the first quarter, and fourteen projects were nearing completion. The workload this quarter exceeded the total workload of the first three quarters of last year, and labor efficiency and construction speed also greatly exceeded last year.

The construction volume in the second quarter will increase by more than 50% compared to the first quarter, with forty-one industrial projects and thirty-one civil projects to be constructed. These seventy-two industrial and civil projects include power plants, brick and tile factories, sugar refineries, enamel factories, small steelmaking workshops, warehouses, universities, and workers' dormitories. These projects are all important items in this year's basic construction plan.

In order to further improve labor efficiency, workers at many construction sites are paying more attention to improving and creating labor tools in the second quarter. For example, the nine construction sites in Hanoi put forward 361 rationalization proposals for improving tools in the first quarter, which increased labor efficiency by more than 50%. At the Viet Tri construction site, labor efficiency has significantly improved after using a large number of wooden carts, ox carts, wheelbarrows, and tricycles.

On the second day of entering the second quarter, President Ho Chi Minh inspected the current largest Viet Tri construction site in North Vietnam, spoke to the workers, and encouraged them to further implement the "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy. President Ho Chi Minh and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong also attended the recent cadre meeting held by the construction department and gave important instructions on accelerating the speed of basic construction and other issues.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 14th: The agricultural cooperation movement in North Vietnam has gained further development this year. As of the end of March this year, a total of 6,830 agricultural cooperatives have been established in North Vietnam, an increase of nearly 2,000 compared to the end of last year. The number of farming households participating in cooperatives accounts for 7.3% of the total number of farming households.

Currently, each agricultural cooperative has an average of 29 households. Some small agricultural cooperatives are being merged into larger agricultural cooperatives. Hai Duong Province, where the cooperative movement is developing best, currently has twenty-two larger agricultural cooperatives with more than 100 households, and the largest Viet Hong agricultural cooperative has more than 400 households.

As soon as a large number of new agricultural cooperatives were established, they immediately plunged into the spring plowing production competition. In the plains areas, agricultural cooperatives in various provinces are generally carrying out deep plowing, rational close planting, and top dressing, and ensuring sufficient water for irrigation. As a result, the rice seedlings are growing vigorously, showing the unparalleled superiority of collective labor.

The Vietnamese Agricultural Cooperation Conference held in Thanh Hoa Province at the end of last year played a positive role in promoting the development of the cooperation movement this year. After the meeting, many places carried out a series of work based on strengthening socialist education for farmers, which promoted the rapid development of the entire movement.

According to the plans formulated by various provinces, in the current stage, various provinces will promote the massive development of permanent mutual aid teams that evaluate work and record points, in order to prepare for the large-scale development of agricultural cooperatives.

    第二季度比第一季度施工量增加一半
    越南各个建设工地战斗紧张
    今春农业社增加二千个常年变工组将大量发展
    新华社河内14日电　本社记者报道：进入第二季度以来，越南北方又有一批新的工厂、学校和住宅的建设工程开始施工。成万职工在各个建设工地上开了第一季度“工作总结会”和“劳动模范大会”之后，目前正在加倍起劲地投入第二季度的战斗。
    根据越南建筑部的统计，在第一季度，有十一项工程完成，有十四项工程接近完成。这个季度的工作量超过了去年前三季工作量的总和，劳动效率和施工速度也大大超过了去年。
    第二季度的施工量比第一季度增加50％以上，有四十一项工业工程和三十一项民用工程要施工。这七十二项工业和民用工程包括发电厂、砖瓦厂、制糖厂、搪瓷厂、小型炼钢车间、仓库、大学和工人宿舍等。这些工程都是今年的基本建设计划中的重要项目。
    为了进一步提高劳动效率，许多工地职工在第二季度里更加注意改进和创造劳动工具。例如河内九个工地在第一季度里提出了三百六十一项改进工具的合理化建议，使劳动效率提高50％以上。在越池工地上，当使用了大量木板车、牛车、独轮车、三轮车之后，劳动效率显著提高了。
    在进入第二季度的第二天，胡志明主席视察了北越当前最大的越池工地，向工人们讲了话，勉励他们进一步贯彻“多快好省”的方针。胡志明主席还同范文同总理先后出席了建筑部门最近召开的干部会议，并在会上就加快基本建设速度等问题作了重要指示。
    新华社河内14日电　越南北方农业合作化运动今年又获得了进一步的发展。到今年3月底为止，整个越南北方已经成立了六千八百三十个农业合作社，比去年年底增加了近二千个。参加合作社的农户占总农户的7．3％。
    目前，平均每个农业合作社有二十九户。一些小农业社正在合并成为大农业社。合作化运动发展得最好的海阳省目前有二十二个一百户以上的较大的农业合作社，最大的越鸿农业社有四百多户。
  大批新的农业合作社刚一成立，就马上投入了春耕生产的竞赛。在平原地区，各省的农业合作社普遍进行深耕、合理密植和追肥，并且保证有足够的水灌溉，因此稻禾长得青萃茁壮，显示了集体劳动的无比优越性。
    去年年底，在清化省举行的越南农业合作化会议对促进今年合作化运动的发展起了积极作用。会后，许多地方在加强对农民的社会主义教育的基础上，开展了一系列的工作，推动了整个运动的迅速发展。
    根据各省制订的计划，目前一个阶段，各省将促进评工记分的常年变工组的大量发展，为农业社的大发展作好准备。
