Overseas Chinese Returnees in the Great Leap Forward
Speech by Committee Member Lu Xinyuan

Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959"; and I agree with Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the CPPCC.

I would like to discuss the work of the People's Government in settling returned overseas Chinese (referred to as returnees) and the performance of returnees during the four years from 1955 to 1958, that is, within the term of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC.

In the past four years, a total of 115,831 overseas Chinese have returned to the country. The vast majority of them were inspired by the growing strength of the motherland and returned to participate in socialist construction; some overseas Chinese students returned to the motherland to study. The People's Government, in accordance with the principles of "practicing strict economy, self-reliance through production, and not allowing a single person to be displaced" and "settling people according to their place of origin, mainly focusing on rural areas, and employing those with skills according to their talents," has given them appropriate resettlement.

Most of the returned overseas Chinese have warm families in their hometowns. In the past four years, China's rural areas have undergone a great historical period of development from the agricultural cooperation movement to the high tide of people's communes. During the stage of agricultural cooperation, the government included the families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese into the unified plan of agricultural cooperation; while mobilizing farmers to join cooperatives, it also mobilized the families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to join cooperatives; it emphasized continuously educating the families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese on the glory of labor, and appropriately arranged for them to participate in labor according to their circumstances. The result of the implementation of this policy is that, on the one hand, the vast number of families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese participated more actively in labor, and on the other hand, some families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese who originally participated less in labor or did not participate in labor gradually developed the habit of labor. In the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the rural communization movement, the People's Government promptly put forward the call to the families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to "strive to be the first in the leap forward," which greatly encouraged their enthusiasm. As a result, 100% of rural overseas Chinese families joined the people's communes, and more than 95% of the overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese with labor power participated in varying degrees of production labor, and their lives have generally improved. At the same time, they actively participated in the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. In this great period of development, the families of overseas Chinese in their hometowns have gradually become warmer and more lovable; thus, every year, many overseas Chinese are attracted to return to their hometowns to live a life of peace and contentment.

Some of the returned overseas Chinese have lived abroad for a long time, their families are abroad, and they have no relatives or friends in their hometowns, and they have nothing to rely on when they return to their hometowns. In the past four years, there have been more than 15,000 returned overseas Chinese of this type, most of whom have been placed in nine state-owned overseas Chinese farms in Guangdong and Fujian, and some have been placed in twelve designated agricultural production cooperatives and small farms invested in by overseas Chinese. In these four years, according to the skills of each person, the People's Government has placed more than 20,000 returned overseas Chinese in state organs, factories, enterprises, and schools; more than 300 elderly and helpless people have been placed in the Taishan County Nursing Home in Guangdong Province; and more than 100 people have been sent back to their original counties and cities to nursing homes or to participate in light labor. The government's overseas Chinese affairs departments have added a cultural and educational personnel tutoring class to the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Students' Secondary Remedial School, and established an overseas Chinese youth study class in Taishan County, Guangdong Province, which accommodated a total of 4,894 returned overseas Chinese cultural and educational workers and youths, who were assigned jobs after a short period of study.

Before liberation, many senior intellectuals went abroad, and many students who studied abroad stayed abroad to work after completing their studies. In recent years, the People's Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Party Central Committee's policy on intellectuals, has taken appropriate measures to settle returned overseas Chinese senior intellectuals, so that they can give full play to their expertise in socialist construction.

Before the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country, although most of the unemployed had obtained employment opportunities during the economic recovery and the implementation of the first five-year plan, the unemployment problem left over from old China had not been completely resolved at that time. Thanks to the care and special consideration of the People's Government, the vast majority of returned overseas Chinese have been given priority in employment opportunities, so that they can take up their posts as soon as possible and work together with the vast number of domestic compatriots to build socialism in the motherland.

Our country is developing by leaps and bounds. The people in the country have learned a lot of practical knowledge in socialist construction and socialist transformation, and have received beneficial education and training. However, the vast majority of overseas Chinese live in countries in the capitalist system, and they cannot get the valuable learning opportunities as the people in the country, and some of them are still poisoned by the reactionary propaganda of the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Therefore, the ideological and political level of the returned overseas Chinese and their understanding of the situation in all aspects of the motherland are generally somewhat different from those of the people of the motherland. This is due to living in two different systems of society. Precisely because of this distance, the ideological and political education of our returned overseas Chinese has become one of the important tasks in the work of the government's overseas Chinese affairs departments.

In the past four years, local governments and relevant departments have further attached importance to the socialist education of returned overseas Chinese. Various forms of unity and education have been adopted in various places, such as large and small-scale report meetings, discussion meetings, cultural and recreational activities, visits and tours, mutual visits, individual talks, and the establishment of personal friendships, etc., to carry out socialist education for returned overseas Chinese. Judging from the general improvement of the ideological and political awareness of returned overseas Chinese, and from the continuous emergence of many advanced producers and labor models of returned overseas Chinese on various production fronts, the socialist education work for returned overseas Chinese across the country has achieved great results.

In particular, after the training of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the returned overseas Chinese have been further able to draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and have further understood the great significance of socialist construction in the motherland, and their political and ideological awareness has been generally improved.

On the basis of the improvement of political and ideological awareness, the returned overseas Chinese in various parts of the country have generally put forward the demand to share weal and woe with the people of the country. In 1958, the government's overseas Chinese affairs departments accepted this progressive demand and cancelled some special subsidies that exceeded the living standards of the local people. They mobilized returned overseas Chinese employees and cadres to go to the mountains and the countryside with employees and cadres from all over the country to carry out labor training. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and under the inspiration of the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country, the returned overseas Chinese in various parts of the country have plunged into the ranks of the Great Leap Forward in production, demanding to go to the mountains and the countryside, demanding to go to any production front needed by the motherland, and demanding to go to the most arduous work posts. Among the returned overseas Chinese, as with the people across the country, many new people and new things worthy of praise have emerged everywhere.

In order to resettle returned overseas Chinese, the People's Government has successively established ten overseas Chinese farms in Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi. Since the Great Leap Forward in production, these farms have made remarkable achievements. Taking the four overseas Chinese farms in Xinglong, Huaxian, Lufeng, and Wengyuan in Guangdong as an example, these four farms have resettled more than 8,000 returned overseas Chinese and invested a total of more than 5.3 million yuan; as of the end of June 1958, the total value of the assets of the four farms was estimated to be more than 10 million yuan, and the total output value in the first half of 1958 was more than 4.88 million yuan. More importantly, the returned overseas Chinese in these farms have created advanced methods for cultivating and processing tropical and subtropical crops. For example, in the production of citronella oil, before the Great Leap Forward, about 17 taels of citronella oil could be extracted from 100 catties of citronella grass. In 1958, the oil extraction rate of citronella grass per 100 catties exceeded the international level of 36 taels; the highest oil yield of the Huaxian Overseas Chinese Farm reached 81.5 taels. The oil yield of fengmao reached 23.1 taels. The citronella oil produced by the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm has an alcohol content of 85% to 90%, the international standard is 85%; the aldehyde content is 40%, the international standard is 35%. The advanced methods of stolon propagation and multilateral slicing created by the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm have made it possible to propagate 260 seedlings from one sisal seedling in one and a half years. In the year of vetiver seedling cultivation, one plant can propagate 20,000 plants. These technical achievements have provided favorable conditions for the development of tropical and subtropical crops in our country.

In the early stage of the Great Leap Forward movement, from February to May 1958, more than 10,000 returned overseas Chinese employees and cadres in more than 30 cities across the country successively held leap forward conferences, put forward leap forward initiatives and resolutions, and launched various competitions, comparing who is redder and more expert, acting as promoters in politics, and acting as innovators in technology; demanding to train themselves into workers class fighters with class consciousness, organizational discipline, and active labor production. On various production fronts, the advanced became more advanced, and the backward also caught up with the advanced, thus emerging many advanced producers and labor models.

At the end of 1958, among the representatives attending the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, there were 74 returned overseas Chinese and their families, including more than 20 representatives of advanced producers. In December 1958, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese held an (enlarged) meeting of the committee in Guangzhou. There were a total of 301 advanced producers and labor models of returned overseas Chinese and their families selected from all over the country to participate in the meeting, and 156 of them were returned overseas Chinese.

The returned overseas Chinese have also made many achievements in technological innovation. For example, Comrade Chen Heng, since returning to China, under the cultivation and education of the Party, has worked hard to study and delve into technology, and has successively created new types of vulcanized dyes, fluorescent whitening agents, and reactive dyes, etc. that exceed international standards. There are many other creations and inventions that have reached the highest level in our country, and I will not list them here.

All these facts show that under the education and cultivation of the Party, whether placed in any work post, the returned overseas Chinese are an active force in the socialist construction of the motherland.

A prosperous and strong motherland gives overseas Chinese great encouragement; the overseas Chinese who return to the motherland are also given the cordial care, education, and thoughtful care of the Party, so it is very natural for them to give play to their positive factors to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland. Now, nearly 300,000 returned overseas Chinese who have returned to the country since liberation are working together with the people of the country, going all out with revolutionary enthusiasm, and striving to complete and overfulfill the construction plan for 1959. The tremendous achievements made by the returned overseas Chinese in the Great Leap Forward also eloquently prove the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system; and it shows that the Party's general line for building socialism is able to fully mobilize the positive factors of the overseas Chinese; and it also shows that the Chinese people who have stood up have an inexhaustible positive force for building socialism.

Finally, I should explain that our returned overseas Chinese feel great anger towards the treasonous crimes of the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary group of the upper class in Tibet. We want to tell the vast number of overseas Chinese abroad that the current Tibetan issue is not a national issue, nor is it a religious belief issue, but the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet launched an armed rebellion with the support of imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and Indian expansionists. All ethnic groups in the country, including the Tibetan people, unanimously demand the eradication of the rebels. We, the returned overseas Chinese, support the People's Government's wise policy of quelling the Tibetan rebellion, and oppose any foreign interference in our internal affairs and infringement on our sovereignty by supporting the armed rebels in Tibet. We are determined to fight to the end for the construction of a strong, prosperous, and happy socialist motherland, and we are also determined to fight to the end to defend the motherland from any infringement.

    归国华侨在大跃进中
    卢心远委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的“政府工作报告”，和李富春副总理所作的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理所作的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”；并同意李维汉副主席所作的政协工作报告。
    我想谈一谈从一九五五年到一九五八年的四年里，即政协第二届全国委员会期内，人民政府安置归国华侨（简称归侨）的工作和归侨在这一段时期的一些表现。
    四年来，回国的华侨共有十一万五千八百三十一人。他们绝大多数是受了祖国的日益强大的感召，而回来参加社会主义建设的；有一部分华侨学生，是回到祖国来学习的。人民政府对于回国要求就业的归侨，根据“厉行节约，生产自救，不使一人流离失所”和“按籍安置，主要面向农村，对有技能者量才录用”的方针，分别给予了妥善的安置。
    归侨中大多数人在故乡有着温暖的家庭。四年来，我国农村经过了从农业合作化运动进到人民公社化高潮的伟大发展的历史时期。在农业合作化阶段，政府就已把农村侨眷、归侨纳入农业合作化的统一规划；在发动农民入社的同时，也发动侨眷、归侨入社；强调不断地向侨眷、归侨进行劳动光荣的教育，根据他们的情况适当地安排他们参加劳动。这一政策实施的结果，一方面是广大的侨眷、归侨更加积极地参加劳动，另一方面，使一部分原来少参加劳动或不参加劳动的侨眷、归侨，也逐渐养成劳动的习惯。在农业生产大跃进和农村公社化运动的高潮中，人民政府又及时地向侨眷、归侨提出“力争跃进居先”的号召，大大地鼓舞了他们的干劲，因而农村侨眷户百分之百加入了人民公社，有劳动力的侨眷、归侨百分之九十五以上参加了不同程度的生产劳动，生活普遍地得到了改善，同时，还积极参加技术革命和文化革命。在这一段伟大发展的历史时期里，华侨在故乡的家庭逐步变得更温暖可爱了；因而每年都吸引了不少华侨回到他们的家乡去过安居乐业的生活。
  归侨中有一部分人，在国外侨居的时间较长，家庭在国外，家乡没有亲属故旧，回到家乡去已无可依靠。在最近四年中，这一类的归侨有一万五千余人，大部分安置在广东、福建的九所国营华侨农场里，一部分安置在指定的十二个农业生产合作社和华侨投资兴办的小型农场。在这四年里，人民政府根据各人的技能，分别安置在国家机关、工厂、企业、学校工作的归侨，有二万余人；年老无依留在广东台山县养老院养老的，有三百余人；送回其各原籍县市养老院养老或参加轻微劳动的，也有百余人。政府侨务部门在北京归国华侨学生中等补习学校增设了文教人员补习班，在广东台山县设立了华侨青年学习班，两处共容纳了归侨文教工作人员和青年四千八百九十四人，经过短期学习之后分配了工作。
    解放以前，有不少高级知识分子出国，留学生中也有不少人学成后留在国外工作。这几年来，人民政府根据党中央所制定的关于知识分子的政策的精神，采取了适当措施以安置归侨高级知识分子，使他们在社会主义建设中发挥了他们的专长。
    在全国工农业生产大跃进以前，虽然在经济恢复和第一个五年计划实施时期，大多数的失业者都已获得就业的机会，但旧中国遗留下来的失业问题，那时还没有完全解决。归侨由于得到人民政府的关怀和特殊照顾，绝大多数人都得到优先就业的机会，得以早日走上工作岗位，和广大的国内同胞一起，为祖国的社会主义建设而努力。
    我国在飞跃的发展着，国内人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中学习了许多实践的知识，受到了有益的教育和锻炼；但是，华侨绝大多数侨居在资本主义体系的国家，他们不可能像国内人民一样得到宝贵的学习机会，有的还要受到美帝国主义者和蒋介石匪帮的反动宣传的毒害。因而归侨的思想政治水平和对于祖国各方面情况的了解，一般地和祖国人民之间会有一些距离，这是生活在两种不同制度的社会所使然。正因为有这种距离，我们归侨的思想政治教育就成为政府侨务部门工作中的重要工作之一。
    四年来，各地方政府和各有关部门对于归侨的社会主义教育，都进一步重视起来了。各地采取了多种多样的团结教育方式，例如大小规模的报告会、座谈会、文娱活动、参观游览、互相访问、个别谈心和建立个人友谊等等，来进行对归侨的社会主义教育。从归侨的思想政治认识的普遍提高，从各个生产战线上不断地涌现了不少归侨先进生产者和劳动模范来看，全国各地对归侨的社会主义教育工作，已经取得很大的成绩。
    特别是经过整风运动和反右派斗争的锻炼，归侨进一步能够划清敌我界线，也进一步了解到祖国的社会主义建设的重大意义，他们的政治思想认识普遍地得到提高。
    在政治思想认识提高的基础上，全国各地的归侨普遍地提出与国内人民同甘共苦的要求。一九五八年，政府侨务部门接受了这一进步的要求，取消了一部分超出当地人民生活水平的特殊补助。发动归侨职工干部和全国各地的职工干部一同上山下乡，进行劳动锻炼。在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国各地掀起的工农业生产大跃进的热潮的鼓舞下，全国各地的归侨纷纷投进了生产大跃进的队伍里，要求上山下乡，要求到祖国所需要的任何生产战线上去，要求到最艰苦的工作岗位上去。在归侨中，和全国人民一样，到处出现了很多值得歌颂的新人新事。
    为了安置归侨，人民政府在广东、福建、广西先后创设了十所华侨农场。这些农场，从生产大跃进以来，都做出了显著的成绩。以广东的兴隆、花县、陆丰和翁源的四所华侨农场来说，这四所农场共安置归侨八千多人，总计投入资金五百三十余万元；截至一九五八年六月底止，估计四所农场的财产总值在一千万元以上，而一九五八年上半年的生产总值为四百八十八万余元。更重要的是，这几所农场的归侨，创造了热带和亚热带农作物的培植和加工技术的先进方法。例如香茅油的生产，在大跃进以前香茅草一百斤蒸出香茅油约十七两。在一九五八年，香茅草每百斤的出油率，超过三十六两的国际水平；花县华侨农场的最高出油量达到八十一两半。枫茅出油率达到二十三两一钱。而兴隆华侨农场出产的香茅油，含醇量达百分之八十五到九十，国际标准为百分之八十五；含醛量为百分之四十，国际标准为百分之三十五。兴隆华侨农场所创造的走茎繁殖和多边剖片等先进方法，使一株剑麻苗一年半繁殖成二百六十株。香根草育苗在一年中一株可繁殖二万株。这些技术上的成就，为我国发展热带、亚热带农作物提供了有利条件。
    在大跃进运动初期，从一九五八年二月至五月，全国有三十多个城市的归侨职工、干部一万余人，先后召开了跃进大会，提出了跃进的倡议书和决心书，展开了各种竞赛，比红比专，在政治上当促进派，在技术上当革新派；要求把自己锻炼成为有阶级觉悟、有组织纪律、积极劳动生产的工人阶级的战士。在各个生产战线上的归侨，先进的更先进，落后的也赶上了先进，从而涌现了许多先进生产者和劳动模范。
    一九五八年底，出席全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的代表之中，有归侨、侨眷七十四人，其中有先进生产者的代表二十余人。一九五八年十二月，中华全国归国华侨联合会在广州召开委员（扩大）会议，从全国各地选拔出来参加会议的归侨、侨眷先进生产者和劳动模范，共有三百零一人，而其中归侨有一百五十六人。
    归侨在技术革新方面，也做出了不少的成绩。例如陈亨同志，回国以来在党的培养教育下，努力学习和钻研技术，先后创制了超过国际水平的新型硫化染料、莹光增白剂和活性染料等。其他达到我国最高水平的创造发明还有不少，这里不多举了。
    所有这些事实，说明归侨在党的教育和培养之下，无论安置在任何工作岗位上，都是祖国社会主义建设的积极力量。
    富强的祖国给予华侨莫大的鼓舞；华侨回到祖国又受到党的亲切关怀、教育和周到的照顾，因而发挥他们的积极因素以加速祖国的社会主义建设，是十分自然的。现在，从解放以来回国的近三十万归侨，正在和全国人民一道，鼓足了革命干劲，为完成和超额完成一九五九年的建设计划而奋斗。归侨在大跃进中所取得的巨大成绩，也雄辩地证明社会主义制度的无比优越性；并说明党的建设社会主义的总路线是能够把华侨的积极因素充分动员起来的；更说明站起来了的中国人民具有发掘不尽的建设社会主义的积极力量。
    最后，我应当说明，我们归侨对于原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团的叛国罪行，感到很大的愤怒。我们要告诉国外广大侨胞，当前的西藏问题不是民族问题，也不是宗教信仰问题，而是西藏上层反动集团在帝国主义者、蒋介石匪帮和印度扩张主义者的支援下发动武装叛乱，全国各族人民，包括西藏人民在内，一致要求肃清叛乱分子。我们归侨拥护人民政府平定西藏叛乱的英明政策，反对任何外国支援西藏武装叛乱分子的干涉我国内政、侵犯我国主权的行为。我们坚决为建设强大的繁荣幸福的社会主义的祖国奋斗到底，也坚决为保卫祖国不受任何侵犯而奋斗到底。
