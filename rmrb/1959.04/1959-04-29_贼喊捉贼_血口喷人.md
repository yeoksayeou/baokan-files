Stop Thief! Slander!

To the Editor:

    In capitalist society, a common trick used by hooligans is: Stop Thief! Slander!

    I think the current behavior of Indian expansionists is somewhat like these people. Tibet is clearly our country's territory, and suppressing the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet is our country's internal affair, but the "Indian Express" falsely accuses us of "violating" the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence at India's doorstep. Isn't this obviously hooligan behavior? The expansionists also chant "Panchsheel" in words, but in reality, they are doing shady things. They appear polite and serious on the surface, speaking circuitously, but no matter how hard they try, they cannot justify themselves. Lies always fall apart. Anyone with clear eyes has already seen who is behind the scenes instigating the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet.

    Some hooligans, when others are polite to them, think you are weak and easy to bully and become even more presumptuous. They shamelessly regard themselves as the successors of British imperialism, openly curse and publicly "demonstrate" in front of our consulate in Mumbai, insulting the leaders loved by our 650 million people. Isn't this the face of a hooligan?

    We do not bully others, but we will never allow ourselves to be bullied. If anyone attempts to bully us, we will definitely give them a good beating with our fists and kicks. The expansionists should wake up! This is a warning.

    贼喊捉贼　血口喷人编辑同志：
    在资本主义社会中，流氓用的惯技是：贼喊捉贼，血口喷人。
    我认为现在的印度扩张主义分子的行为，倒有些像这些人。西藏明明是我国的领土，平定西藏上层反动分子叛乱是我国的内政，但“印度快报”却诬指我们在印度大门口“违反”五项和平原则。这不显然是流氓行为吗？扩张主义者口头上也叫着“潘查希拉”，实际上却干着不可告人的勾当。他们表面上斯斯文文，一本正经，说话拐弯抹角，但是费尽心思，还是不能自圆其说，假话总是说不圆的，西藏上层反动分子叛乱的幕后策动者是谁，明眼人早已看得一清二楚。
    有些流氓，当别人对他客气时，他却以为你软弱可欺而得寸进尺。恬不知耻地以英帝国主义继承人自居，公然破口大骂，公然在我国驻孟买领事馆前“示威”，侮辱我国六亿五千万人民所敬爱的领导人。这不是流氓嘴脸吗？
    我们是不欺侮别人的，但是也决不容许被人欺侮。倘使有人企图欺侮我们，我们一定饱以老拳，饷以铁脚。扩张主义者的头脑应该清醒过来了！这是忠告。
