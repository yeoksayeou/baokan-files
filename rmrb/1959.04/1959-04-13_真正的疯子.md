　　The Real Madmen
　　Former U.S. Air Force Major Eatherly, who led U.S. bombers to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, near the end of World War II, was sentenced by the Dallas County Court in the United States on the 10th of this month to be confined to a mental hospital for 90 days.

　　Eatherly has suffered repeated nervous breakdowns and has been confined to mental hospitals several times. Because he still has a conscience and believes he should be held responsible for the bloody crime of killing 300,000 Japanese civilians, he both fears retribution from the Japanese people and suffers endless condemnation from his conscience.

　　One cannot help but recall the suicide of former U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal by jumping from a building. Although he did not suffer from the condemnation of his conscience, the mania for atomic war also drove this famous secretary mad. Obviously, the tragedy of American atomic maniacs is far from over. The American warmongering clique dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and now continues to brandish atomic bombs, only to lift a stone to drop it on their own feet, arousing a tide of anger from all upright people against the American atomic war plan. Now, the American warmongering clique can confine Eatherly and remain indifferent to Forrestal's madness, still baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, indulging in their atomic war frenzy. However, the truly pathetic ones are precisely these real madmen. Their end will be more than just entering a mental hospital and jumping from buildings.

    真正的疯子
    第二次世界大战结束前夕率领美国轰炸机以原子弹轰炸日本广岛与长崎的美国前空军少校伊瑟利，于本月10日被美国达拉斯县法院判决，关在精神病院里禁闭九十天。
    伊瑟利一再神经失常，被关进精神病院已有好几次。因为他还有良心，认为应对杀伤三十万日本平民的血腥罪行负责，这使他既怕日本人民算账，又受良心的无休止的谴责。
    人们不禁想起美国前国防部长福莱斯特尔跳楼自杀的事件。他虽然不是因为受到良心的谴责，但原子战争狂热也使这个鼎鼎大名的部长发了疯。很显然，美国原子狂人的悲剧还远远没有结束。美国好战集团在广岛和长崎投原子弹，现在继续挥舞原子弹，都只能搬起石头砸自己的脚，引起了全体正直人类反对美国原子战争计划的怒潮。现在美国好战集团可以禁闭伊瑟利，可以对福莱斯特尔的发疯而无动于衷，照旧张牙舞爪，大发其原子战争狂。但是，真正可悲的，正是这批真正的疯子们。他们的下场，决不止是进精神病院和跳楼。
