Integrating Labor to Improve Teaching and Research Work
Nanjing Forestry College Teachers and Students Go Deep into Rural Areas to Comprehensively Implement the Education Policy

(According to the Xinhua Daily report) Teachers and students of Nanjing Forestry College have gone deep into rural areas to connect with reality. Under the leadership of the local Party organization, they have made great achievements in labor training, on-site teaching, and scientific research.

In less than half a year, the majority of teachers and students have eaten, lived, and worked with the laboring people, and their ideological outlook has undergone varying degrees of change, initially cultivating feelings for workers and peasants and strengthening their labor viewpoint. Students in the Nanjing and Yangzhou areas often went to the mountains before dawn to collect seeds. Students in the Maoshan team in southern Jiangsu braved the rain to create the "Eastward Advance Forest." Some students' cotton clothes were soaked, but they continued to work as usual. Wherever the teachers and students went, they helped the masses with housework. The masses said: "These are the college students sent by Chairman Mao, they are really good! In the past, it was difficult to see college students, but now college students eat, live, and work with us. This is really the good leadership of Chairman Mao."

While actively participating in labor, teachers and students also grasped the teaching work. They adopted methods such as combining teachers, students, and production experts, combining classroom teaching with on-site teaching, and combining systematic lectures with special lectures. In the past four months, they have taught 175 special topics, and the quality of teaching has been significantly improved. For example, when teaching the "Charcoal Kiln" course, teachers lectured in the classroom, and experienced old workers with decades of charcoal burning experience lectured on their experiences. Then, under the guidance of teachers and old workers, practical operations were carried out. In this way, students understood the theoretical knowledge and technological operation process of the charcoal kiln more firmly in a shorter period of time. For example, before leveling the ground to make seedbeds, on-site teaching about nurseries and seeds was conducted; before winter afforestation, teaching on the ecology, biological characteristics, and afforestation methods of various trees was conducted. This teaching method, which combines theory with practice, not only increased students' practical knowledge and operational skills, but also consolidated and improved students' theoretical knowledge level. Students generally reflected: "The knowledge learned in this way will never be forgotten in a lifetime." Now, students have basically mastered the morphology and ecological characteristics of various trees in the area, as well as seedling cultivation and afforestation methods, the propagation, cultivation, and pruning techniques of various fruit trees, soil types, and fertilizer types, properties and usage methods, as well as the life history and control methods of major pests and diseases, and so on.

Teachers and students have also made great achievements in scientific research and textbook compilation. According to the needs of production, they used local materials to trial-produce 183 new products using indigenous methods. For example, the sea buckthorn seeder and universal seeder created by students of the Subei Brigade increased work efficiency by more than 30 times. Teachers and students who went to Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, and coastal areas used local materials and indigenous methods to make activated carbon from rapeseed husks, cotton bolls, and wood chips; fiberboard from rice straw, castor stalks, and shavings; and aromatic oil from pine needles. This not only increased the economic income of the commune, but also opened up a way for the comprehensive utilization of forestry in mountainous areas. In addition, through investigation visits, seminars, and typical experiments, they summarized production experiences from various aspects, and on this basis, compiled 781 professional scientific pamphlets, totaling more than 6 million words. The content of these pamphlets often does not exist in books, and they made critical verifications of the original theories.

Now, on the basis of the achievements already made, under the leadership of the Party, teachers and students are striving to make more achievements in on-site teaching, scientific research, and textbook compilation while strengthening ideological remolding.

    结合劳动提高教学和研究工作
    南京林学院师生深入农村全面贯彻教育方针
    据新华日报消息：南京林学院师生深入农村联系实际，在当地党组织的领导下，在劳动锻炼、现场教学、科学研究等方面，都有很大的收获。
    广大师生，在不到半年的时间内，和劳动人民同吃、同住、同劳动，思想面貌已起了不同程度的变化，初步培养了工农感情，增强了劳动观点。在南京、扬州地区的学生，经常天不亮就上山采种，苏南茅山小队的学生，冒雨造“东进林”，有的学生棉衣湿透了还照常干。师生们每到一处，都帮群众做家务事。群众说：“这是毛主席派来的大学生，真好！过去看到大学生好不容易，现在大学生和我们同吃、同住、同劳动，真是毛主席的好领导。”
    师生们在积极参加劳动的同时，也抓紧了教学工作。他们采取教师、学生、生产能手相结合，课堂教学与现场教学相结合，系统讲授与专题讲课相结合等办法，四个月来教授了一百七十五个专题，而且教学质量有了显著的提高。例如：在进行“炭窑”这一门课教学的时候，一方面由教师在课堂上讲，一方面请了具有几十年烧炭经验的老工人讲授烧炭经验，然后在教师、老工人的指导下，进行实际操作。这样，学生们就在较短的时间内，较巩固地懂得了炭窑的理论知识和工艺操作过程。再如，在整地做苗床劳动以前，就进行了有关苗圃和种子的现场教学；在冬季造林以前，就进行各种树的生态、生物特性及造林方法的教学等。这种理论联系实际的教学方法，既增加了学生的实际知识和操作技能，又巩固和提高了学生的理论知识水平。学生普遍反映说：“这样学到的知识，一辈子也忘不了。”现在，学生基本上都掌握了所在地区的各种林木的形态、生态特性，以及育苗造林方法，各种果树的繁殖、培育、整枝等技术，土壤种类及肥料种类、性能和使用方法，以及主要病虫害的生活史及防治方法等等。
    师生在科学研究、编写教材方面也作出了很大成绩。他们根据生产上的需要，就地取材，用土法试制新产品达一百八十三项。如苏北大队的学生创造的海棠播种机和万能播种机，就提高工效三十倍以上。到浙江、苏南以及沿海地区的师生，就地取材，利用土法，把油菜壳、棉铃、木屑等原料，制成了活性炭；用稻草、蓖麻秆、刨花等制成了纤维板；用松针制成了芳香油等等。这样，不仅增加了公社的经济收益，同时为山区林业的综合利用开辟了一条途径。此外，他们通过调查访问、开座谈会与典型试验等方式，总结各方面的生产经验，并在这基础上，编写出各种专业性科学小册子七百八十一本，约六百余万字。这些小册子的内容，不少是书本上没有的，而且对原来的理论，作了批判性的检定。
    现在，师生们在已经取得成绩的基础上，在党的领导下，力争在加强思想改造的同时，要在现场教学、科学研究与编写教材等方面，作出更多的成绩。
