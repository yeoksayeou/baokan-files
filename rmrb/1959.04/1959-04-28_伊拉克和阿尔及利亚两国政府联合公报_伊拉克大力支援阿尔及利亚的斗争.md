Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 26th: The delegations of the government of the Republic of Iraq and the provisional government of the Republic of Algeria today issued a joint communiqué on their talks here.

The communiqué stated that the visit of the Algerian government delegation, headed by Prime Minister Abbas, to Iraq provided a valuable opportunity for the two governments to reaffirm the relationship between the two peoples and to strengthen the ties of friendship between them.

The communiqué stated that the Algerian delegation witnessed the Iraqi people moving forward courageously to defend the fruits of their revolution. The Iraqi people believe that the rich fruits of the revolution should serve the Arab people engaged in the struggle against imperialism and reactionaries, especially the heroic Algerian people.

The communiqué stated that both sides clearly see that the Algerian national liberation war has come a long way due to the great efforts of the Algerian people. Ending this war in the interests of Algeria and the Arab nation depends on the rapid and effective support of the governments and peoples of all Arab countries. The communiqué stated that there is no doubt that this final stage is very important. Completing this stage will determine the fate of imperialism in the Arab homeland.

The communiqué stated that Prime Minister Qasim believes that the Algerian war is the war of the Iraqi people and all fighting Arab people. He also expressed that the Iraqi people and government are prepared to fully support the Algerian people with money, weapons, and on the international stage, and support their noble struggle.

The communiqué stated that the Iraqi government has decided to allocate 2 million dinars this year to support this sacred national struggle. The communiqué stated that 750,000 dinars have already been paid, 500,000 dinars will be paid in mid-July, and the remaining 750,000 dinars will be paid in October 1959.

The communiqué stated that in addition to this amount, the Iraqi government has promised to supply Algerian fighters with sufficient weapons and equipment to enhance their combat strength in the struggle for freedom, independence, and the expulsion of unjust colonialists.

The communiqué concluded by saying that both sides are convinced that the liberation of the Arab nation is a common cause, and this cause will only be completed when all parts of the Arab homeland are liberated from imperialist rule.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 26th: The delegation of the provisional government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Prime Minister Abbas, ended its visit to Iraq and left here at noon today for a visit to Kuwait.

Prime Minister Qasim, ministers of various departments, leaders of various people's organizations, and diplomatic envoys from some countries to Iraq went to the airport to see the delegation off.
