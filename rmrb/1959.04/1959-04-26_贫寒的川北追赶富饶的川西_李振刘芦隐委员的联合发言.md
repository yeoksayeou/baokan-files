Chairman, fellow committee members:
	We fully endorse the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan, the government work report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, the report on the draft national economic plan for 1959 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and the report on the 1958 national final accounts and the 1959 national budget draft made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian.
	Now, let us present the following speech based on our recent observations and insights gained during our inspection of Anyue County in Sichuan (including Jianyang and Lezhi) in accordance with the notice from the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC regarding the implementation of the policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more.
	Our inspection began in Jianyang on March 18th and concluded in Anyue on March 31st, lasting only thirteen days. In such a short time, we could only conduct a focused inspection. Although it was a "whirlwind tour," the content was rich and delightful. Everywhere we looked, we saw the continuation of the Great Leap Forward, and we became more and more excited and encouraged. Overall, we received another vivid and profound socialist education.
	Here, we can only present our four points of understanding, one confidence, and one determination regarding the current implementation of the policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more in Anyue County.
	First, planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more is the correct policy to achieve a continued Great Leap Forward in grain production as the focus, while simultaneously developing diversified operations.
	This year, based on the agricultural Great Leap Forward of last year, Anyue County, according to the policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more, has made new arrangements for the county's cultivated area: 300,000 mu for wheat, 600,000 mu for rice, 300,000 mu for sweet potatoes, 300,000 mu for cotton, 100,000 mu for rapeseed, and 150,000 mu for peanuts. This arrangement is intended, on the one hand, to comply with the principle of adapting to local conditions, and on the other hand, to free up some land area to develop other undertakings in addition to rotating various crops. The main purpose is to grasp both the large-scale Great Leap Forward in grain production and the great development of diversified operations. Therefore, we realize that this year's arrangement in Anyue is in line with the policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more.
	Second, planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more points out the correct direction for continuous agricultural production increase.
	The old farming method was extensive planting with low yields, using a lot of manpower and materials but harvesting little. However, according to the current policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more, concentrating the manpower and materials previously used for extensive planting with low yields on less planting with higher yields has a very different result. Taking Anyue County's Annong People's Commune as an example, the commune members calculated the following: this year, the commune's total spring grain sowing area is 20% smaller than last year, but the total output can increase several times; concentrating the labor, seeds, and fertilizers used on the original area in the past on the 20% smaller area this year makes achieving high yields even more reliable. According to the calculation, although the costs and labor have increased somewhat, the actual increase in production can reach several times. This shows that the implementation of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more does not waste manpower and materials, and the result is that the potential of land production can continue to grow, and farmers' harvests can continue to increase. Without the guidance of the policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more, with dispersed labor, insufficient fertilizer, and rough cultivation, it would be difficult to continue to achieve high yields. However, this year's spring crops are growing luxuriantly, and the fact of high yields and more harvests is already before our eyes, which is how the peasant masses recognize this point. Therefore, the farmers all say: as long as production increases, we will work even if we don't sleep. Just as we were conducting on-site inspections, the farmers suddenly received a weather forecast of night winds and rain, and immediately mobilized a large army of men and women, going out to the fields to rescue the wheat from lodging, fighting tirelessly day and night, showing that the peasant masses are full of determination and confidence to break through the high-yield wheat barrier and are not shaken by the merciless wind and rain in the slightest.
	Third, the policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more must be combined with the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture to have a reliable foundation of technical measures.
	As everyone knows, the complete set of technical measures for soil, fertilizer, water, seed, close planting, protection, management, and tools are rich experiences summed up from the gradual increase in agricultural production in recent years. Fully adapting to and implementing these eight aspects of technical measures to serve the implementation of the policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more is a major key to the continued smooth leap forward in agricultural production this year. For different natural conditions and different crops, of course, different technical measures must be taken to achieve high yields and more harvests. This is the general principle of the "Eight-Point Charter" that has been explored so far. However, in agricultural practice, the "Eight-Point Charter" is still constantly developing. For example, many people's communes in Anyue County, in order to earnestly implement the "Eight-Point Charter" to the end, also adopted the "Eight No-Planting" field operation specifications: (1) No planting if deep plowing does not reach a certain depth; (2) No planting if the base fertilizer applied per mu is not enough; (3) No planting if there are no irrigation conditions; (4) No planting if seeds have not been selected and soaked; (5) No planting if the soil is not finely prepared; (6) No planting if the number of seeds per mu does not reach a certain amount; (7) No planting if the soil quality is not suitable; (8) No planting without acceptance. It can be seen that with the continuous Great Leap Forward in agriculture, agricultural technical measures are also constantly developing. Viewing the current "Eight-Point Charter" as having a uniform fixed form is not realistic.
	Fourth, the policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more has a promoting effect on the further development of agricultural technology and science.
	This policy is one of realizing the large-scale development of food crops and the diversified development of economic crops, and therefore requires continuous scientific and technological experimentation and research in many aspects such as soil quality, seeds, and fertilizers, to explore and master the objective laws of how various crops can achieve high yields and more harvests. There are still many things that need to be tested and researched. As we saw this time, in the many experimental fields, command fields, and satellite fields, just for wheat alone, there are various kinds of seed problems, soil quality problems, plowing depth problems, fertilizer types, quantity, and method problems, etc., which are still being explored in many ways. In the past, under the private ownership of land, the experimental research of agricultural science and technology was not only restricted but also impossible. Now, we see that only after our rural communization is it possible to implement the policy of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more on a vast scale of land, and only then is it possible and necessary to promote the continuous research and development of agricultural science and technology.
	During our inspection, we excitedly saw that, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the previously impoverished northern Sichuan has caught up with the prosperous western Sichuan. Taking Anyue County as an example, especially since communization last year, everyone has work, and there is no longer a vagrant in the entire county; under the situation of continuous agricultural production increase, and in the situation of the agricultural Great Leap Forward last year, the lives of the broad masses of people have generally joined public canteens, and eating is free; with the gradual development of cultural education, all school-age children in the county have been enrolled; with the implementation of the Party's complete set of "parallel" policies, transportation and highway transportation have greatly developed, and the entire county has been motorized; from "native" to "foreign," the "native and foreign combined" people-run industries and commune-run industries are also blooming everywhere. Overall, the whole country is in a Great Leap Forward, and all regions are in a Great Leap Forward, promoting each other and advancing together. Under the brilliant light of the general line of socialism, everyone rides on a steed, following the path of the 1958 Great Leap Forward to complete our new task of the 1959 Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, and this is what we, like the people of the whole country, have absolute confidence in.
	Through our hearing Premier Zhou's government work report this time, summarizing the great achievements of the 1958 national Great Leap Forward, sounding the resounding clarion call for another Great Leap Forward in 1959, and through our inspection in Anyue and its surrounding areas, seeing the vivid scene of transforming from "poor and blank" to rich and prosperous, looking back at our own personal spiritual realm, we deeply feel that our ideological transformation is still not keeping up with the current new situation of the Great Leap Forward, thus further encouraging our urgent desire and demand to intensify our own fundamental transformation, and further strengthening our determination to obey the leadership of the Party and follow the socialist road. In the future, we must more strictly demand of ourselves, and in the combination of work, study, and labor, and in the combination of service and transformation, redouble our efforts to continue self-transformation, so as to play our role in serving the socialist Great Leap Forward. I wish comrades good health! I wish the conference success!

### 贫寒的川北追赶富饶的川西  李振刘芦隐委员的联合发言

    贫寒的川北追赶富饶的川西
    李振刘芦隐委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们完全拥护李维汉副主席所作的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，李富春副总理所作的关于一九五九年度国民经济计划草案的报告，以及李先念副总理所作的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告。
    现在，让我们把最近我们遵照本届政协全国委员会常务委员会的通知，在四川简阳、乐至、安岳三县视察所得对于安岳县贯彻少种、高产、多收的方针一些认识和体会，作如下的发言。
    我们这次视察，从三月十八日到简阳开始，至三月三十一日在离开安岳时结束，为时仅仅十三天。在这样短短的时间，我们只能作重点的视察，虽是“走马观花”，但是内容丰富，美不胜收。我们一路看到，四方八面都在继续大跃进，越看越感到兴奋，越看越受到鼓舞。总的说来，我们又一次受到了生动的深刻的社会主义教育。
    这里，我们只能就安岳县目前贯彻少种、高产、多收这一个方针的情况，提出我们所得的四点认识，一条信心，和一条决心。
    第一，少种、高产、多收，是实现以粮食继续大跃进为重点，而又同时发展多种多面经营的正确方针。
    今年安岳县，在去年农业大跃进的基础上，根据少种、高产、多收这一方针，对全县的耕种面积作出了新的布置：小麦三十万亩，水稻六十万亩，红苕三十万亩，棉花三十万亩，油菜十万亩，花生十五万亩。这样一个布置，一方面是要符合因地制宜的原则，一方面还要在各项作物轮番种植之外，空出一部分土地面积来发展其他事业，而主要的目的就是，既要抓紧大面积粮食生产大跃进，又要抓紧多种经营的大发展。因此，我们认识到，安岳今年的布置，是符合于少种、高产、多收的方针的。
    第二，少种、高产、多收，是指出了农业不断增产的正确方向。
    过去老一套的耕作方法是广种薄收，用的人力物力多而收获少。但是按照现在少种、高产、多收的方针，把过去用于广种薄收的人力物力集中起来用在少种多收上面，结果就大大不同了。以安岳县安农人民公社为例，社员们同我们算了一笔账：今年这个社整个小春粮食播种面积比去年缩小了百分之二十，而总产量可以增加好几倍；把用于过去原有面积上的劳动力、种子和肥料，集中用在今年缩小了百分之二十的面积上，实现高产就更加可靠了。据算出的结果，这样的做法，成本和劳动力虽然有所增加，而实际增产的数量可达到几倍以上。这就说明，少种、高产、多收的贯彻，实质上并没有空耗人力和物力，而所得的效果是能够使土地生产的潜力不断增长，使农民的收获不断增多。如果没有少种、高产、多收这一方针的指导，劳动力分散，肥料不充足，耕作粗糙，要继续实现高产是很困难的。但是，今年小春苗稼长得丰盛，高产多收的事实已在眼前，农民群众都是这样地认识到这一点。因此，农民都说：只要增产多，不睡觉我们都要干。正当我们在现场进行视察时，农民忽然得到气象台预报有夜风夜雨来袭的消息，马上就动员大批男女大军，四出田间，抢救小麦免被倒伏，日夜战斗不倦，可见农民群众满怀争取突破小麦高产关的决心和信心，丝毫没有为无情风雨所动摇。
    第三，少种、高产、多收的方针必须要与农业“八字宪法”相结合地实现，才有可靠的技术措施基础。
    大家知道，土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工这八方面的整套技术措施，是从这几年来农业逐步增产过程中总结下来的丰富经验。充分地适应地贯彻这八方面的技术措施，为实现少种、高产、多收的这一方针服务，是今年农业生产继续顺利跃进的一个重大关键。对于不同的自然条件和不同的作物，当然就要采取不同的技术措施，才能收到高产多收的效果。这是“八字宪法”在目前已经摸索到的一般原则。但是在农业实践中，“八字宪法”还在不断地发展。例如安岳县有不少的人民公社，为了认真贯彻“八字宪法”落底，还采取“八不种”的田间操作规格：（1）深耕不到一定深度的不种；（2）每亩底肥下不够的不种；（3）没有浇灌条件的不种；（4）没有经过选种浸种的不种；（5）土不整细的不种；（6）每亩种子不到一定数量的不种；（7）土质不适宜的不种；（8）没有验收的不种。可见随着农业不断的大跃进，农业技术措施也还在不断的发展中。把目前的“八字宪法”看作有千篇一律的定形，是不切合实际的。
    第四，少种、高产、多收的方针，对于农业技术和科学的进一步发展带有促进作用。
    这一个方针，是实现粮食作物大片大面积发展和经济作物多种多面发展的方针，因而需要不断地从土质、种子、肥料等等多方面去进行科学技术的试验和研究，把各种作物如何才能够达到高产多收目的的各项客观规律摸索出来，并把它掌握起来。其中需要试验和研究的东西还是很多的。如我们这次所看到的多少试验田、指挥田和卫星田，单是小麦一项，就有多种多样的种子问题，土质问题，翻土深浅问题，施肥种类、分量和方法问题等等，还在多方探索之中。在过去土地私有制之下，农业科学技术的试验研究，不仅受到了限制，而且是不可能的；现在呢，我们看到，只有在我们农村公社化以后，才有可能在广大土地上实施少种、高产、多收的方针，也才有可能和必要，推动农业科学技术不断的研究和发展。
    这次我们在视察中，兴奋地看到，在党和毛主席的正确领导下，一向贫寒的川北已经赶上富饶的川西了。就拿安岳一县来说，特别是自去年公社化以来，人人有工作，全县已无一个游民了；在连年农业增加生产的形势下，在去年农业生产大跃进的形势下，广大人民的生活都普遍地加入了公共食堂，吃饭不要钱了；在文化教育逐年发展的情况下，全县学龄儿童都已入学了；在党的整套“并举”方针实现下，交通公路运输大大发展了，全县都已车子化了，由“土”到“洋”，“土洋结合”的民办工业，社办工业，也正在遍地开花了。总的看来，全国在大跃进，各地在大跃进，互相推动，共同迈进。在社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，人人跨上千里马，踏着一九五八年大跃进的道路前进，来完成我们一九五九年工农业生产大跃进的新任务，这是我们个人与全国人民一样，都有绝对的信心的。
    通过我们这次听了周总理的政府工作报告，总结了一九五八年全国大跃进的伟大成就，鼓起了一九五九年再大跃进的响亮号角，和通过我们在安岳一带的视察，看到了由“一穷二白”变成富饶繁荣的生动情景，反顾我们自己个人的精神领域，深深感到我们的思想改造，还赶不上当前大跃进的新形势，因而越发鼓舞了我们对自己加紧根本改造的迫切愿望和要求，越发加强了我们服从党的领导走社会主义道路的决心。今后，我们必须更严格地要求自己，在工作、学习、劳动三结合中，在服务与改造相结合中，加倍地继续努力进行自我改造，才能发挥我们为社会主义大跃进服务的作用。祝同志们健康！祝大会成功！
