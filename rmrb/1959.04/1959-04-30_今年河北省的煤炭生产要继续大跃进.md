Comrade Hou Baozheng said: To accomplish this task, we must continue to engage in mass movements, constantly overcome conservative thinking, and ensure that everyone contributes ideas, everyone offers plans, every front achieves high yields, and every mine reaps a rich harvest. At the same time, we must launch a conservation movement and use national resources where they are most needed.
Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with the reports made to the Congress by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I will give a brief report to the Congress on the efforts of Hebei Province's coal industry to strive for an even greater leap forward in 1959 on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958.

1958 was a year of great leap forward for our country, a year of utmost glory. In this year, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, our socialist construction cause has developed rapidly and achieved an all-round leap forward.

China's coal production reached 270 million tons in 1958, an increase of 108 percent over 1957. Both in absolute quantity and in the speed of growth, it has surpassed the United Kingdom. This is another sign that "the East wind prevails over the West wind."

In 1958, Hebei Province's coal industry implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction and the policy of walking on two legs, as well as the policy of combining centralized leadership with mass movements. It vigorously promoted both "large-scale foreign methods" and "small-scale indigenous methods," thereby achieving a leap forward in coal production. The output of raw coal has reached more than 25.3 million tons, an increase of 63.18 percent over 1957. While coal production developed, mine construction also achieved great progress. The designed capacity of new mines built in 1958 was 15.54 million tons, equivalent to more than twice the total capacity of new mines built in the province during the First Five-Year Plan. In order to adapt to the needs of the great development of the coal industry, in terms of coalfield geological exploration, mass mobilization was launched to carry out prospecting and ore finding. In 1958, 6.7 billion tons of proven reserves were obtained, exceeding the total of proven reserves obtained during the First Five-Year Plan.

In 1958, the coal industry in Hebei Province also made great progress in technology. On the basis of the rectification movement, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, all employees emancipated their minds, broke down superstitions, criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, got rid of the shackles of dogmatism, promoted the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, and formed a vigorous mass technical revolution movement. In 1958, there were more than 400,000 new production and construction records and inventions, technical innovations, and other projects in the province's coal mines, which powerfully promoted the development of production and construction in various mines. At the same time, during the great leap forward, two fully hydraulic mining mines were built, and with the close cooperation of workers and technicians, many difficult technical problems in hydraulic mining were solved, advancing coal production technology a step forward.

1959 is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward for our national economy. It is a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard struggle. Our province's raw coal output is planned to be 39 million tons, an increase of 54 percent over 1958. This plan is formulated based on objective possibilities and the subjective initiative of the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm, and it is also a plan for a greater leap forward. In terms of capital construction, the designed capacity of new and continued mines to be built this year is 8.16 million tons. In order to meet the needs of the development of the steel industry for refined coal, a number of simple coal washing plants have been newly built, with a designed capacity of 10.5 million tons. In addition, two modern large-scale coal washing plants with a designed capacity of 3.5 million tons will be handed over in the near future.

Can we complete this plan for a greater leap forward? We say that we can complete it. We have the confidence and also the sufficient basis and favorable conditions. This year, the Party Central Committee has included the production and construction of the coal industry in the four major indicators. The whole Party and the whole people are focusing on coal. In addition, the broad masses of employees have raised their political awareness and their labor enthusiasm is even higher during the great leap forward in 1958. This is the most fundamental guarantee for us to complete the task. Secondly, in the great leap forward, production organization work has also accumulated many successful experiences. As long as we rely on the leadership of the Party, fully mobilize the masses, continue to oppose conservatism, break down superstitions, go all out, aim high, promote the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, and overcome difficulties in every possible way, we will be able to complete and overfulfill this plan. However, completing the 1959 plan is still a very arduous task, requiring us to make greater efforts and to do in-depth and meticulous ideological and organizational work.

First of all, we must rely on the leadership of the Party, continue to adhere to putting politics in command, conscientiously implement the general line for socialist construction put forward by the Party, vigorously engage in mass movements, vigorously promote technical revolution, and deeply carry out the red flag competition for high yield, high quality, and large-scale high yield.

The experience of the great leap forward in 1958 proves that only by conscientiously implementing the mass line, widely mobilizing the masses, and vigorously engaging in mass movements can we overcome conservative thinking, break down superstitions, and ensure the realization of advanced production indicators. Mass movement means vigorously promoting red flag competition to achieve large-scale high yield. In the first quarter of this year, due to the mobilization of the masses and the launch of the red flag competition for large-scale high yield, 88 large-scale high-yield coal mining working faces emerged in the province, and four mines reached the standard of high-volume high yield, so the raw coal production task for the first quarter of this year was successfully completed.

In the future, we must widely carry out this competition movement and push it to a climax. We require that all working faces in all large mines in the province can achieve high yield or high-volume high yield according to different conditions, so as to achieve high yield on every front and rich harvest in every mine. To this end, in the vigorously developing red flag competition movement, we must vigorously engage in technical revolution and technical innovation. The technical revolution should implement the policy of combining general and cutting-edge technology, but currently, general technology should be the main focus. This means vigorously promoting effective advanced experiences, especially the 36 advanced experiences summarized and proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry. Among them, advanced experiences such as multi-cycle operation on the same working face, rapid conveyor movement, one shot one cut, and long-arm shearer and disc shearer coal mining should be promoted under conditions that are suitable and ensure safety. At the same time, our mines should also focus on the weak links and key problems existing in production, mobilize the masses to offer ideas and plans, and study and solve them at any time, so that the wisdom of the masses can be fully utilized. The masses' experiences, inventions, and creations should be promptly and conscientiously studied, summarized, and promoted, creating a wave of learning from and catching up with the advanced, so that the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses can play a greater role in the production and construction of the coal industry.

With the in-depth development of mass movements, our political and ideological work must keep up closely, constantly opposing conservative thinking and breaking down superstitions. First of all, we must overcome the erroneous thinking among cadres that they only see things and not people, and that they believe that potential has already been fully tapped. According to the specific situation of some mines, after the old conservative thinking is overcome, new conservative thinking will still appear, especially among some engineering and technical personnel at present. This requires us to constantly overcome various conservative thinking in our future practical work in order to promote the continuous development of production.

Secondly, with the development of mass movements, we also need to strengthen a series of management work. To complete this year's production tasks, in addition to strengthening capital construction, vigorously carrying out rapid construction, accelerating the progress of mine construction handover, and ensuring timely commissioning of production, we mainly rely on tapping the potential of existing production mines. The main way to tap potential is to take high-yield working faces as the center, and use advanced balancing methods to catch up with the backward links, and achieve a new and more advanced balance on the basis of adapting to high-yield needs. This requires us to vigorously accelerate the pace of development and tunneling and strengthen production preparation work. At the same time, we must improve the utilization rate of existing equipment, give full play to the efficiency of machinery, vigorously promote mechanization and small-scale mechanization, reduce the labor intensity of workers. In addition, we must rectify labor organization, step up the training of new workers, reduce auxiliary workers, increase direct production workers, strengthen the strength of mining and tunneling, and improve labor productivity.

Under the leadership of the Party, we must also widely launch a conservation movement, use national materials in the most needed places, and let them play a greater role, spending less money and doing more things, and making every effort to reduce raw material consumption, actively promoting substitutes for pit props, and strengthening the recovery and reuse of pit props. In every corner, we must eliminate all phenomena of waste. We must rely on the masses to strengthen economic accounting, widely carry out economic activity analysis among the masses, and ask the masses to check the completion of various economic indicators and the existing problems, find out the reasons, take measures, and plug loopholes, so that economic work can be done more and more carefully, and production and construction can achieve an all-round leap forward.

We must conscientiously implement the "Four Great Freedoms," "Two Participations," and "Three Combinations" industrial constitution. This is the fundamental method to strengthen management work. In this way, we can closely connect the relationship between cadres and the masses, improve the sense of responsibility of workers as masters, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, and change our leadership style. We must improve enterprise management in all aspects, so that our management work can adapt to the current situation of a greater leap forward.

The convening of this National People's Congress is a great encouragement to all our coal mine employees. We must, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, go all out, aim high, and strive to complete the production and construction tasks of the coal industry in Hebei Province in 1959 along the direction indicated by the general line!

Finally, on behalf of all 120,000 employees of the coal mines in Hebei Province, I strongly condemn the imperialists and Indian expansionists for interfering in our country's internal affairs and splitting the unity of our country's ethnic groups. The reactionary upper class in Tibet colluded to create an armed rebellion in the Tibetan region. We feel extremely indignant at these shameful acts. We firmly express our determination to support the government's smashing of this despicable conspiracy with practical actions to increase production, so that it will suffer a shameful defeat.

Please correct me if my speech is inappropriate.

    今年河北省的煤炭生产要继续大跃进
    侯宝政代表说：为了完成这个任务，就要继续大搞群众运动，不断克服保守思想，作到人人献策，个个献计，面面高产，矿矿丰收。同时还要开展节约运动，把国家物资用到最需要的地方去主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长向大会所作的报告。现在，我就河北省煤炭工业在一九五八年大跃进的基础上争取一九五九年更大跃进的问题，向大会做一简要的汇报。
    一九五八年，是我国大跃进的一年，是极其光辉的一年。在这一年中，我国社会主义建设事业在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，有了飞快的发展，获得了全面的跃进。
    我国煤炭产量在一九五八年达到二亿七千万吨，比一九五七年增长了百分之一百零八，在绝对的数量上和增长的速度上都超过了英国，这是“东风压倒西风”的又一标志。
    河北省煤炭工业在一九五八年贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线和两条腿走路的方针，贯彻了集中领导与群众运动相结合的方针，大闹“大洋群”“小土群”，从而使煤炭产量获得了飞跃增长。原煤产量已经达到了二千五百三十多万吨，比一九五七年增长了百分之六十三点一八。在煤炭生产发展的同时矿井建设事业也获得了很大的发展，一九五八年新建矿井的设计能力一千五百五十四万吨，相当于第一个五年计划期间全省新建矿井总能力的两倍还多。为了适应煤炭工业大发展的需要，在煤田地质勘探方面，发动群众开展了普查找矿工作，一九五八年获得普查储量六十七亿吨，超过了第一个五年计划期间内获得普查储量的总和。
    一九五八年河北省煤炭工业在技术方面也有了很大的发展。全体职工在整风运动的基础上，在总路线的光辉照耀下，解放思想，破除迷信，批判了右倾保守思想，摆脱了教条主义的束缚，发扬了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，形成了轰轰烈烈群众性的技术革命运动。一九五八年全省煤矿所出现的生产建设新纪录和发明创造、技术革新等项目，约有四十多万件，这就有力地促进了各矿生产建设的发展。同时，在大跃进中建成了两座全部水力采煤矿井，并且在工人和技术人员的紧密协作下，解决了水力采煤技术上的许多困难问题，使煤炭生产技术向前推进了一步。
    一九五九年是我国国民经济更大、更好、更全面跃进的一年，是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年。我省原煤产量计划为三千九百万吨，比一九五八年增长百分之五十四。这个计划是根据客观可能性和群众革命干劲的主观能动性而制定的，也是一个更大跃进的计划。在基本建设方面，今年新建续建矿井的设计能力为八百一十六万吨。为了适应钢铁工业发展对精选煤的需要，新建了一批简易洗煤厂，设计能力为一千零五十万吨，并且要在最近期间内移交两座现代化大型洗煤厂，其设计能力为三百五十万吨。
    我们能不能完成这个更大跃进的计划呢？我们说能够完成，我们有信心也有充分的根据和有利的条件。今年党中央把煤炭工业的生产建设列入了四大指标，全党全民大抓煤炭，再加上广大职工在一九五八年大跃进中，提高了政治觉悟，劳动热情更加高涨，这就是我们完成任务的最根本的保证。其次在大跃进中生产组织工作也积累了许多成功的经验，只要我们依靠党的领导，充分发动群众，继续反对保守，破除迷信、鼓足干劲、力争上游、发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，千方百计地克服困难，就能够完成和超额完成这个计划。但是完成一九五九年的计划还是很艰巨的，需要我们作更大的努力，需要我们作深入细致的思想工作和组织工作。
    首先我们要依靠党的领导，继续坚持政治挂帅，要认真贯彻党所提出的社会主义建设总路线，要大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，深入开展高产、高质大面积丰产红旗竞赛。
    一九五八年大跃进的经验证明，只有认真贯彻群众路线，广泛发动群众，大搞群众运动，才能克服保守思想，破除迷信，才能保证先进生产指标的实现。群众运动就是要大搞红旗竞赛，实现大面积丰产。今年第一季度由于发动了群众，开展了大面积丰产红旗竞赛，全省就出现了八十八个大面积丰产的采煤工作面，并且有四个矿井达到了高额丰产的标准，所以就胜利的完成了今年第一季度的原煤生产任务。
    今后我们还要把这个竞赛运动广泛开展，推向高潮，要求把全省大型矿井所有的工作面根据不同的条件都能达到高产或者高额丰产，做到面面高产，矿矿丰收。为此，在蓬勃发展的红旗竞赛运动中，必须大闹技术革命和技术革新。技术革命要贯彻一般与尖端技术相结合的方针，而当前要以一般技术为主，这就是大力推广行之有效的先进经验，特别是煤炭工业部总结所提出来的三十六项先进经验，其中如同工作面多循环作业，快速移溜，一炮一刀，和长截盘截煤等先进经验，都要在条件适合、保证安全的情况下，加以推广，同时，我们各矿也要针对生产中存在的薄弱环节和关键性的问题，发动群众人人献策，个个献计，随时加以研究和解决，使群众的智慧充分发挥出来；并且要把群众的点滴经验，群众的发明创造及时认真地加以研究总结、推广，造成一个学先进、赶先进的热潮，使群众的干劲和智慧在煤炭工业生产和建设中发挥更大的作用。
    随着群众运动的深入发展，我们的政治思想工作要紧紧地跟上去，不断地反对保守思想、破除迷信，首先要克服干部中存在的那些见物不见人和认为潜力已经挖到顶点的错误思想。根据有些矿的具体情况来看，旧的保守思想被克服以后，新的保守思想还会出现，尤其在当前某些工程技术人员中，表现得比较明显。这就要求我们在今后的实际工作中，不断地克服各种保守思想，才能推动生产的不断发展。
    其次，随着群众运动的发展，我们还需要加强一系列的管理工作。我们要完成今年的生产任务，除了加强基本建设，大搞快速施工、加快移交矿井建设进度、保证按时投入生产外，主要是依靠挖掘现有生产矿井的潜力。挖掘潜力的主要途径是以高产工作面为中心，用先进平衡的方法，使落后环节赶上去，在适应高产需要的基础上，达到新的更先进的平衡。这就要求我们大力加快开拓和掘进进度，加强生产准备工作。同时要提高现有设备利用率，充分发挥机械效能，大力推行机械化，小型机械化，减轻工人的劳动强度。此外还要整顿劳动组织，加紧新工人的培训，减少辅助工，增加直接生产工，充实采掘力量，提高劳动生产率。
    在党的领导下还要广泛地开展一个节约运动，把国家的物资运用到最需要的地方去，并且让它能够发挥更大的作用，少花钱多办事，千方百计地降低原材料消耗，积极推广坑木代用品，加强坑木的回收和复用。在各个角落里要杜绝一切浪费的现象。我们要依靠群众加强经济核算工作，在群众中广泛地开展经济活动分析，要群众自己检查各项经济指标完成的情况和存在的问题，找出原因，采取措施，堵塞漏洞，这样才能使经济工作越做越细致，使生产建设达到全面的跃进。
    我们一定要认真贯彻“四大”“两参”“三结合”的工业宪法，这是加强管理工作的根本方法。这样就能够密切干部和群众的关系，提高工人的主人翁的责任感，充分发挥群众智慧，改变我们的领导作风。我们要从各方面改善企业管理，使我们的管理工作能够适应当前更大的跃进形势。
    这次全国人民代表大会的召开，对我们全体煤矿职工是一个很大鼓舞，我们一定要在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，沿着总路线所指引的方向，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为完成一九五九年河北省煤炭工业生产建设任务而奋斗！
    最后，我代表河北省煤矿全体十二万职工强烈的谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，干涉我国的内政，分裂我国各民族的团结，西藏上层反动集团勾结在西藏地区制造武装叛乱。我们对这些可耻的行为，感到极大的愤慨。我们坚决表示以增加生产的实际行动来支持政府粉碎这个卑鄙的阴谋，使它遭到可耻的失败。
  我的发言是否妥当，请各位代表指正。
