Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, April 4th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has already transplanted rice seedlings on 1.3 million mu of land. Now, throughout the autonomous region, from the Zhuang-populated areas near the Friendship Pass in the south to the high-altitude mountainous areas of Sanjiang and Da Miao Shan in the north, and from the upper reaches of the West River in the east to the Bai Se Yun and Gui Plateau in the west, which stretch for thousands of miles, members of the People's Communes are engaged in labor competitions for transporting fertilizer, harrowing fields, raising seedlings, and transplanting rice.

Since the beginning of spring, Guangxi has enjoyed favorable weather, unlike the usual spring droughts of previous years. The spring plowing and sowing work in the People's Communes throughout the region has been better and started earlier than in any previous year. All early and mid-season rice paddies have been plowed to a depth of eight inches or more, with an average accumulation of 1,257 dan of fertilizer per mu, a twofold increase compared to last year. The use of improved seed varieties has been universally adopted. Seedling fields are generally plowed and harrowed three times, with some plowed and harrowed four times. Because preparations for rice paddies were completed two solar terms ahead of schedule, this year it is not "seedlings waiting for fields," but "fields waiting for seedlings."

To ensure increased grain production, the autonomous region has taken the following measures this year: expanding the planting area of early and mid-season rice by more than 210,000 mu; allocating about 80% of the labor force to spring plowing and sowing.

    风调雨顺春正好  深翻播种现高潮
    广西
    据新华社南宁4日电 广西僮族自治区已插秧一百三十万亩。现在，自治区南起睦南关下的僮族聚居地区，北至高寒山区的三江、大苗山；东自西江上游，西到千里山川的百色云、桂高原，到处有人民公社的社员们在进行运肥、耙田、育秧、插秧的劳动竞赛。
    入春以来，广西风调雨顺，与历年春旱情况不同。各地人民公社的春耕春播工作，比以往任何一年都作得好、动手早，所有的早、中稻田都深耕八寸以上，平均每亩积肥一千二百五十七担，比去年增加一倍；普遍实现了良种化；秧田一般三犁三耙，一部分四犁四耙；由于提前两个节令做好稻田准备工作，今年不是“秧等田”，而是“田等秧”。
    为保证粮食增产，自治区今年曾经采取了如下一些措施：扩大早、中稻种植面积二十一万多亩；调配了80％左右的劳动力投入春耕春播。
