　　Launch a Surprise Campaign to Eliminate Pests and Diseases

　　International Labor Day on May 1st is approaching. According to the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Continuing to Launch the Four Pests Elimination Campaign," actively carrying out a surprise campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene during this year's May Day is something all localities should value.

　　The second quarter of this year is the decisive quarter for completing the annual industrial production tasks and is also the busiest quarter for agricultural activities. Especially before May Day, the red flag competition on the industrial and agricultural production fronts is in full swing. Under such intense production conditions, to carry out a surprise campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene well, we must thoroughly implement the spirit of combining with production and serving production, making appropriate arrangements according to local conditions and timing, so as to both facilitate the development of the campaign and ensure that the labor army is safe and healthy to achieve brilliant accomplishments in the great leap forward in the production competition.

　　The period around May Day is when the weather gradually becomes hot, especially in southern regions where the sun is already scorching. This is the time when the four pests begin to breed and engage in large-scale activities. Therefore, Henan, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and other regions have already started inspection work in March; Beijing, Shanghai, Guangxi, Yunnan, and sixteen other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have also decided to carry out inspection work one after another in April to promote the active development of the surprise campaign to eliminate pests and diseases through large-scale inspections. In this way, it is possible to eliminate the four pests that begin to breed and threaten people's health at the beginning of their breeding cycle. We must never allow the four pests to reproduce generation after generation; we must eliminate the vectors of infectious diseases.

　　How can we actively carry out this surprise campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene according to local conditions and timing? In order to ensure that the labor army is safe and healthy to achieve continuous victories in the great leap forward in production, all localities and departments must first pay attention to the hygiene work in production sites and collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens. However, China has a vast territory, and the climate, natural environment, and past work foundations vary from place to place, and various production sites are also different. Therefore, all localities and departments must grasp their own characteristics and specific situations, seize their respective key points, and propose specific tasks, requirements, and content in order to be realistic and achieve the expected results. Now, Beijing has proposed three specific contents for carrying out this surprise campaign based on the specific situation: First, focus on areas where the working people gather, such as factories, construction sites, public places, collective dormitories, and stations, to carry out large-scale environmental sanitation; second, carry out large-scale food hygiene to prevent and control spring and summer infectious diseases; and third, eliminate the first generation of mosquitoes and flies by digging up pupae, catching and beating, and controlling breeding sites. If all localities and departments can put forward such specific requirements and implement them item by item, then the four pests will have nowhere to hide, and summer epidemics can be effectively controlled.

　　In order to promote the national campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene a step forward through this surprise campaign, all localities must also arrange for regular work after the surprise campaign is over. If regular work can be linked to the surprise campaign and the work of eliminating pests and diseases can be persisted in, then the achievements on the health front will be consolidated and expanded step by step, and the plague god will disappear from the socialist paradise.

### 开展除害灭病的突击运动

　　开展除害灭病的突击运动
    “五一”国际劳动节就要到来了。根据党中央“关于继续展开除四害运动的决定”的规定，在今年“五一”节积极开展除四害、讲卫生的突击运动，正是各地应当重视的一次除害灭病的突击运动。
    今年第二季度，是完成全年工业生产任务的决定性季度，也是农事最紧张的季度。特别在“五一”节前，工农业生产战线上红旗竞赛正热火朝天。在这样生产紧张的情况下，要很好开展除四害、讲卫生的突击运动，就必须很好地贯彻结合生产、为生产服务的精神，因时因地制宜地作好妥善安排，以便既有利于运动的开展，更有利于保证劳动大军安全而健壮地在生产竞赛中获得大跃进的辉煌成就。
    “五一”节前后正当气候逐渐炎热的时候，特别是在南方各地，早已赤日炎炎，这是四害开始大量繁殖和大肆活动的时机了。因此，河南、新疆、四川等地，已经在3月间开始了检查工作；北京、上海、广西、云南等十六个省、市、自治区也决定在4月间先后开展检查工作，要用大检查来推动除害灭病突击运动的积极开展。这样，就有可能把开始孳生、威胁人们健康的四害歼灭在开始孳生之时。我们决不能够让四害一代代地繁殖下去，我们一定要杜绝传染疾病的媒介。
    怎样因时因地制宜地积极开展这次除四害讲卫生的突击运动呢？为了保证劳动大军安全而健康地在生产大跃进中取得不断的胜利，各地各部门首先要注意生产场所和集体福利事业如公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园中的卫生工作。但是，我国地域辽阔，各地气候、自然环境不同，过去工作基础不同，各种生产场所也有所不同，所以各地各部门必须根据自己的特点和具体情况，抓住各自的重点，提出具体的任务、要求和内容，才能切合实际地收到预期的效果。现在，北京市根据具体情况，对开展这次突击运动提出了三大具体内容：一、以工厂、工地、公共场所、集体宿舍、车站等劳动人民集聚的地区为重点，大搞环境卫生；二、大搞饮食卫生，防治春夏季传染病；三、以挖蛹、捕打、控制孳生场所等方法，消灭第一代蚊蝇。如果各地各部门都能够这样比较具体地提出要求，并且逐项实现，那就将使四害无藏身之地，而夏季的流行病就能够有效地控制。
    为了通过这次突击运动，把全国的除四害、讲卫生运动向前推进一步，各地在突击运动将结尾时，还须安排好以后的经常工作。如果经常工作能和突击运动相衔接，把除害灭病工作坚持下去，那么，卫生战线上的战果将会步步巩固和不断扩大，瘟神将在社会主义的乐园中绝迹。
