Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently convened an all-army cultural and educational work conference in Beijing to summarize and exchange the achievements and experiences gained in the mass campaign of cadre cultural education throughout the army during the past winter and spring. They also discussed and arranged the implementation of the General Political Department's plan to popularize secondary and higher education among cadres this year. The conference called on party committees and political organs at all levels throughout the army to firmly, meticulously, and thoroughly grasp cadre cultural education, maintaining both momentum and perseverance, taking sustained measures to achieve remarkable results in the first year of the ten-year plan for popularizing secondary and higher education.

The conference believed that the cadre cultural education work throughout the army this past winter and spring was characterized by great determination, strong enthusiasm, tight grasp, numerous methods, large scale, and rapid development, with considerable achievements. Under the slogan of "Seize the gaps in the training year to vigorously promote cultural education," various units formulated plans to popularize secondary and higher education among cadres, uniformly arranging work and study time, and launching a mass cultural learning craze. To date, the entire army has established tens of thousands of various amateur cultural schools, training classes, and self-study groups. A part-time teaching force of more than 50,000 people has also been organized. More than 50% of officers have participated in various learning organizations, with most people studying 100 to 200 hours during this period. Among them, the majority of students in middle school classes have completed one course, and a minority have completed two or more middle school courses.

The conference believed that the rapid development of the cadre cultural education movement this past winter and spring was mainly due to the leadership of party committees and the full mobilization of the masses. In the early stages of the movement, various units mobilized the masses to raise difficulties, think of solutions, and engage in extensive airing of views, first solving ideological problems such as "learning mainly relies on oneself" and "seizing time for self-study is the basic method to resolve the contradiction between work and study." Subsequently, the masses were mobilized to launch a wave of school establishment and learning. If there were no textbooks, they compiled, printed, and bought them themselves. If there were no classrooms, they used offices and dormitories instead. If there were no teachers, the masses recommended them or asked for help from local areas. Everything was simple and practical, without pursuing empty fame, only seeking practical results, truly "learning wherever one goes, with the drill ground and dining hall being classrooms everywhere." To solve the contradiction between work and study, party committees at all levels arranged learning tasks while arranging work, and adopted various learning methods suitable for the time and place. For example, combining on-the-job self-study with short-term intensive training, running schools at the regimental, battalion, and company levels, and organizing learning by department in the organs, etc.

The conference introduced the experiences of many advanced units and, with a view to persisting in long-term learning, determined that under the premise of ensuring the completion of work tasks, the entire army should adhere to the principle of mainly relying on amateur tutoring classes and individual self-study, supplemented by off-the-job intensive training, and adopting various learning methods. The conference believed that as long as individuals strive hard, study diligently, and persevere, and the leadership provides support and guidance, it is entirely possible to popularize secondary and higher education among cadres throughout the army within ten years.

During the conference, General Tan Zheng, Director of the General Political Department, and Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director, both spoke.

　　解放军干部掀起文化学习热潮
　　全军已办业余学校、训练班几万所，50％军官参加学习
    新华社16日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部最近在北京召开了全军文化教育工作会议，总结和交流去冬今春全军大搞干部文化教育运动所取得的成就和经验，并讨论和安排了今年贯彻执行总政治部关于在干部中普及中等、高等教育的问题。会议号召全军各级党委和政治机关，对于干部文化教育要抓紧、抓细、抓到底，既有猛劲又有韧劲，采取措施持之以恒，使普及中、高等教育十年大计的第一年取得显著成绩。
    会议认为，去冬今春全军干部文化教育工作具有决心大、干劲足、抓得紧、办法多、规模大、发展快的特点，成绩是不小的。在“抓紧训练年度的间隙时间，大搞文化教育的口号下，各部队纷纷制定了在干部中普及中、高等教育的规划，统一安排了工作与学习的时间，掀起群众性的文化学习热潮。到目前止，全军已办起各种业余文化学校、集训班、自修班好几万所。一支五万多人的兼职教员队伍也已组织起来。50％以上的军官都参加了各种学习组织，大多数人在此期间学习了一至二百小时。其中，中学班学员多数学完了一门课，少数学完了两门以上的中学课程。
    会议认为，去冬今春干部文化教育运动发展如此迅速的主要原因是党委挂帅，充分发动了群众。运动初期，各部队发动群众提困难，想办法，大鸣大放，首先解决了“学习主要依靠自己”、“抓紧时间自学是解决工作与学习矛盾的基本方法”等思想认识问题。接着，就发动群众掀起办校和学习的热潮。没有教材就自己编，自己印，自己买。没有教室，用办公室、宿舍代替。没有教员，群众就自己推荐或请地方帮助解决。一切因陋就简，不务虚名，只求实效，真正是“走到那，学到那，操场、饭堂，处处是课堂”。为解决工作和学习的矛盾，各部队党委在布置工作同时布置学习任务，并且因时因地制宜，多种学习方式并举。如实行在职自修与短期集训相结合，团、营、连各级办校和机关以部门为单位办学，等等。
    会上介绍了许多先进单位的经验，并且从坚持长期学习着眼，确定了在保证完成工作任务的前提下，全军应坚持以业余补习班和个人自修为主，离职集训为辅，多种学习方式并举的方针。会议认为，只要本人奋发努力、勤学苦练、坚持下去，领导上给予支持和引导，十年以内，在全军范围内普及干部的中、高等教育是完全可以实现的、
    会议期间，总政治部主任谭政大将、副主任刘志坚中将都讲了话。
