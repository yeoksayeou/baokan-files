　　The National Conference on Workers' Education in Industrial and Mining Enterprises proposes:
　　Continuously Improve Workers' Education in Development

    Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: The National Conference on Workers' Education in Industrial and Mining Enterprises, recently held in Beijing, based on the Party's educational policy and the needs of socialist construction and development, summarized the work of 1958 and discussed the current guidelines, tasks, and several important issues of workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises. The conference unanimously agreed that workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises must conscientiously implement the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor," and undertake the significant task of gradually popularizing education and cultivating cadres among workers, so as to better serve production and construction. In 1959, workers' education should be further developed, consolidated, and improved on the existing foundation. All regions should, based on their own circumstances, continue to carry out the literacy campaign, vigorously develop workers' primary schools, actively develop workers' secondary schools, and prepare conditions for running workers' secondary schools on a large scale in the future. The conference emphasized that in the course of development, it is necessary to earnestly strengthen the work of consolidation and improvement, and to strengthen the education of new workers.
    This conference was convened by the Second Office of the State Council under the instructions and care of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Responsible comrades from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as relevant departments of the central industrial, transportation, and education sectors, responsible comrades from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional trade unions, and responsible comrades from more than 70 industrial and mining enterprises from all over the country attended the conference.
    In recent years, the workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises has achieved remarkable results. In 1958, under the correct guidance of the Party's educational policy, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a new situation of rapid development and active reform emerged. The political enthusiasm and learning enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers soared to unprecedented levels. Through mass literacy campaigns, the situation in which 70%-80% of pre-liberation workers were illiterate has undergone fundamental changes, and most people have emerged from illiteracy. The number of workers enrolled in schools has increased rapidly in various places, and a variety of school-running forms and methods have been created in the course of development. Some industrial and mining enterprises have begun to establish a workers' education system ranging from primary school and secondary school to higher education. Political education and technical education have been universally strengthened. Education has played an active role in carrying out technological innovation and promoting production.
    After discussion, the conference unanimously agreed that the task of workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises should be: to gradually popularize education at all levels among workers, and to continuously improve the political awareness and cultural and technical levels of the broad masses of workers; and to systematically train a large number of cadres, especially technical cadres, for production and construction. Popularizing education among workers is, from the current point of view, an important task to carry out technological revolution, improve labor productivity, and accelerate socialist construction; in the long run, it is a necessary condition for realizing the intellectualization of the working class, narrowing the gap between manual and mental labor, and preparing for the transition to communism. The conference believes that at present, the cultural level of workers is still very low, and most people are still at the primary school level. It is a very arduous task to gradually popularize secondary and higher education among workers with the conditions. However, as long as we work actively, practically, and persistently under the leadership of the Party, it is possible to achieve it in a considerable period of time. The development of China's socialist construction requires a large number of technical cadres. It is not enough to rely solely on full-time universities and secondary vocational schools to train them. Industrial and mining enterprises must share a large part of this task and actively train cadres in production.
    The conference focused on discussing the implementation of the Party's educational policy in accordance with the characteristics of industrial and mining enterprises and workers. Industrial and mining enterprises are mainly engaged in production, and the objects of education are producers, most of whom are adults and a considerable number of young people, who are all undertaking production tasks and work tasks, and the labor is relatively intense; among workers, there are many differences in industry, type of work, position, age, etc., and their political consciousness, production technology level, cultural level, and learning requirements are also different. Therefore, the implementation of the Party's educational policy should emphasize the principles of "combining with production, unified arrangements, teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, and flexibility and diversity," and the central issue is that education should be combined with production and serve production. The leadership of industrial and mining enterprises should make unified arrangements for production and education; comrades engaged in education should care about production and learn necessary production knowledge, so that education can become a force to promote production.
    The conference believes that in the future, the development of workers' education should continue to take spare-time education as the main form. All industrial and mining enterprises should actively establish workers' spare-time schools. Those who are temporarily unable to run them independently can run them jointly by industry or region. The spare-time schools run by the local government (i.e., district schools) should continue to be run well. In areas with more small and medium-sized factories, in cases where factory schools cannot meet the learning requirements of workers, or for the needs of training teachers, they should continue to be run well and appropriately developed. In terms of the school-running system, it is necessary to implement graded school-running, appropriate division of labor, and joint school-running by factories and mines and workshops (work sections).
    The conference believes that solving the problem of study time is an important condition for running spare-time education well. According to the provision of the Eight Session of the Sixth Plenary of the Party that every day eight hours of labor and two hours of learning and the experience of industrial and mining enterprises in many regions, it is generally possible to carry out six to ten hours of organized learning per week under normal production conditions, and this should be guaranteed in the future. The conference believes that as long as the leadership of industrial and mining enterprises make unified arrangements for production, education, and life, and combine persistence and flexibility in organizing learning, spare-time learning time can be solved, and workers' education can be run and run well.
    To run workers' education well, it is necessary to improve teaching work and improve the quality of education. The conference pointed out that teaching work must be guided by the Party's educational policy and implement the principle of "unity of theory and practice." It is necessary to pay attention to the current production needs, but also to learn the necessary systematic basic knowledge. Political education, technical education, and cultural education should be carried out in combination. In workers' education, full attention must be paid to political education. On the one hand, it is necessary to closely combine with the domestic and international situation and central tasks, link with the actual thinking of workers, strengthen current affairs and policy education, improve political awareness, and overcome the ideological influence of various non-working classes; on the other hand, it is necessary to carry out more systematic theoretical education, advocate learning philosophy and learning theory, so that workers can gradually grasp the viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. In industrial and mining enterprises, technical education must be constantly emphasized; cultural education is complementary to technical education and must be emphasized. For the arrangement of technical education and cultural education, there should be appropriate distinctions in different educational stages and different objects. In the primary school stage, it should generally focus on cultural basic education; in the higher education stage, it should focus on professional education; in the secondary education stage, the proportion of the two types of courses should be different in ordinary schools and vocational schools, and specific arrangements should also take into account the requirements of workers of different ages and different industries.
    The conference believes that actively solving the problem of teachers is an extremely important task. All regions and all industrial and mining enterprises should give it sufficient attention. On the one hand, we must take the method of "those who are capable can be teachers" and "taking materials locally," mobilize on-the-job cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers with higher cultural and technical levels to concurrently take on teaching work to solve the current large demand for teachers; on the other hand, we must actively develop normal education, open teacher training classes and spare-time normal schools, systematically train teachers, and expand the teacher team. Under the conditions permitted by production, a part of workers should be selected from industrial and mining enterprises for training. The plans of various provinces and cities to train teachers should include the teachers of workers' education. For the existing teachers from intellectuals, we must implement the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals, use and improve them well, establish a system of regularly participating in productive labor, transform their thinking, learn production knowledge, and improve teaching methods.
    Strengthening the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for running workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises well. In the future, the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of industrial and mining enterprises should often do a good job in the following three aspects to create conditions for carrying out education: to do a good job in political and ideological work and constantly improve workers' enthusiasm for learning; to comprehensively arrange production, learning, rest and other after-work activities; to run well collective welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens; so as to enable workers to do a good job in production, learning, and rest as much as possible. In order to develop workers' education in a planned way, all regions, all business systems, and all industrial and mining enterprises should, in accordance with the guidelines, tasks, the needs of production development, and their own conditions, formulate a plan for the development of workers' education, and earnestly overcome the phenomenon of spontaneity. At present, we should first make proper arrangements for the work in 1959.

　　全国工矿企业职工教育工作会议提出
　　职工教育要在发展中不断提高
    新华社19日讯　不久前在北京召开的全国工矿企业职工教育工作会议，根据党的教育方针和社会主义建设发展的需要，在总结1958年工作的基础上，讨论了当前工矿企业职工教育的方针、任务和几个重要问题。会议一致认为，工矿企业的职工教育，必须认真贯彻“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的方针，担负起在职工中逐步普及教育和培养干部的重大任务，以便更好地为生产建设服务。1959年，职工教育应该在已有的基础上进一步地发展和巩固提高。各地区应该根据自己的情况，继续开展扫盲运动，大力发展职工小学，积极发展职工中学并为今后大办职工中学准备条件。会议强调在发展中要切实加强巩固提高工作，要加强对新工人的教育。
    这次会议，是在党中央和国务院的指示与关怀下由国务院第二办公室召开的。参加会议的有全国各省、市、自治区和中央各工业、交通、教育等有关部门的负责同志，全国总工会和省、市、自治区工会的负责同志，以及来自全国各地区的七十多个工矿企业的负责同志。
    工矿企业的职工教育工作，几年来取得了显著的成绩。1958年在党的教育方针的正确指导下，随着工农业生产的大跃进，出现了迅速发展和积极改革的新形势。广大职工的政治热情和学习积极性空前高涨。通过群众性的扫盲运动，解放前职工中70％—80％是文盲的情况，现在已经发生了根本的变化，多数人脱离了文盲状况。各地职工入学人数增加很快，在发展中创造了多种多样的办学形式和方法，有的工矿企业开始建立了从小学、中学到高等学校的职工教育体系。政治教育和技术教育普遍地加强了。教育对于开展技术革新和推动生产起了积极作用。
    会议经过讨论一致认为，工矿企业职工教育的任务应该是：在职工中逐步普及各级教育，不断地提高广大职工的政治觉悟和文化技术水平；并且有计划地为生产建设培养大量的干部，特别是技术干部。在职工中普及教育，从当前说，是开展技术革命，提高劳动生产率，加速社会主义建设的一项重要工作；从长远说，是实现工人群众知识化，缩小体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，为过渡到共产主义作准备的一个必要条件。会议认为，目前职工的文化水平还很低，多数人还是小学程度，要在有条件的职工中逐步普及中等和高等教育，是一个很艰巨的任务。但是，只要在党的领导下，积极地踏实地坚持不懈地进行工作，在相当长的时间内是可能作到的。我国社会主义建设事业的发展，需要大量的技术干部，仅仅依靠全日制的高等学校和中等专业学校来培养是很不够的，工矿企业必须分担这个任务的很大一部分，在生产中积极培养干部。
    会议着重讨论了根据工矿企业和职工的特点贯彻党的教育方针问题。工矿企业是以生产为主，教育的对象是生产者，多数是成年人和相当数量的青年人，他们都担负着生产任务和工作任务，劳动比较紧张；职工之间，既有行业、工种、职务、年龄等许多差别，政治觉悟、生产技术水平、文化程度和学习要求也不相同。因此，贯彻党的教育方针，应该强调“结合生产，统一安排，因材施教，灵活多样”等原则，而中心的问题，是教育结合生产，为生产服务。工矿企业的领导上，要对生产、教育进行统一安排；办教育的同志要关心生产，学习必要的生产知识，使教育成为推动生产的力量。
    会议认为，今后发展职工教育，应该继续以业余教育作为主要形式。一切工矿企业应该积极建立职工业余学校，暂时没有条件单独举办的可以按行业或按地区联合举办。地方举办的业余学校（即区校），应该继续办好，在中小厂较多的地方，在厂校还不能满足职工学习要求的情况下，或者为了培养师资等需要，应该继续办好和适当发展。在办学体制上，要实行分级办学，适当分工，厂矿办和车间（工段）办并举。
    会议认为：解决学习时间问题是办好业余教育的重要条件。根据党的八届六中全会决议中每日八小时劳动两小时学习的规定，和许多地区工矿企业的经验，在生产正常的情况下，每周进行六至十小时的有组织的学习，一般是可以作到的，今后应该加以保证。会议认为：只要工矿企业的领导上，对生产、教育、生活进行统一安排，在组织学习上把坚持性和灵活性结合起来，业余学习时间是能够解决的，职工教育是能够办起来和办好的。
    办好职工教育，必须改进教学工作，提高教育质量。会议指出，教学工作必须以党的教育方针为指导思想，贯彻“理论和实际统一”的原则。要重视当前的生产需要，也要学习必要的系统的基础知识。政治教育、技术教育、文化教育应该结合进行。在职工教育中，对政治教育必须给以充分的重视。一方面，要密切结合国内外形势和中心任务，联系职工的思想实际，加强时事政策教育，提高政治觉悟，克服各种非工人阶级的思想影响；另一方面，要进行比较系统的理论教育，提倡学哲学、学理论，使职工逐步地掌握辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点和方法。在工矿企业中，必须经常重视技术教育；文化教育是和技术教育相辅而行的，必须重视。对于技术教育和文化教育的安排，在不同教育阶段和不同对象，应该有适当区别。小学阶段，一般应该以文化基础教育为主；高等教育阶段，应该以专业教育为主；中等教育阶段，两类课程的比重，在普通学校和专业学校中应该各有所侧重，具体安排时还要照顾到不同年龄和不同行业职工的要求。
    会议认为，积极解决师资问题是一项极为重要的工作。各地区、各工矿企业应该给以足够的重视。一方面要采取能者为师、就地取材的办法，发动在职干部、工程技术人员和文化技术水平较高的工人兼任教学工作，解决当前对师资的大量需要；另一方面要积极地发展师范教育，开办师资训练班和业余师范学校，有计划地培养师资，扩大教师队伍。在生产许可的条件下，要从工矿企业中挑选一部分职工进行培养。各省、市培训师资的计划中应该包括职工教育的师资。对于现有的知识分子出身的师资，要贯彻党的团结改造知识分子的政策，很好地使用和提高他们，建立经常参加生产劳动的制度，改造思想，学习生产知识，改进教学方法。
    加强党的领导，是办好工矿企业职工教育的根本保证。工矿企业的行政、工会、共青团今后应该经常作好三方面的工作，为开展教育创造条件：要作好政治思想工作，不断提高职工的学习积极性；要全面地安排生产、学习、休息及其他工余活动；要办好食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业；以便尽可能地使职工作到生产好、学习好、休息好。为了有计划地发展职工教育，各地区、各业务系统、各工矿企业应该根据方针、任务、生产发展的需要和自己的条件，制订一个发展职工教育的规划，认真克服自流现象。目前，首先应该对1959年的工作做出妥善地安排。
