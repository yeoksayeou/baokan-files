Comrades Representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian's reports, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report, and I guarantee to actively strive and earnestly implement them in my future practical work.

I am a worker from the No. 6 Well of the Jiaohe Coal Mine in Jilin Province, and I currently serve as the production team leader of the 601 Coal Mining Team without being detached from production. At this conference, I would like to report on the situation of our coal mining team.

Double Harvest in Ideology and Production with Steel as the Key Link and the Great Leap Forward in Mind

In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction and driven by the policy of taking steel as the key link and overall leap forward, Jilin Province's coal production overfulfilled the Great Leap Forward target of 10.01 million tons 26 days ahead of schedule. The production volume increased by 50.6% compared to 1957. The index of this year's increase was 620,000 tons more than the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan. The profit turned over to the state was 26.45 million yuan, doubling the initial plan. The basic construction of coal mines and coalfield geological exploration also achieved significant successes this year, laying a favorable foundation for a greater leap forward in 1959. Our Jiaohe Coal Mine also overfulfilled the Great Leap Forward plan in 1958. The initial plan for raw coal production was 1.08 million tons. After the great rectification movement, the workers improved their awareness, exerted their soaring energy, and completed 1.445 million tons with a spirit of hard work and ingenuity, reducing costs by 764,000 yuan, and achieved a double harvest in ideology and production.

Our 601 Coal Mining Team was established in 1952. When the leadership initially asked me to be the team leader, I felt that my abilities were insufficient, and I encountered many difficulties in my work. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and the close reliance on the masses, the difficulties were finally overcome one by one. All team members listened to the Party and dared to struggle against difficulties. If the roof was broken, we added more supports and enlarged the caps. If the high coal seam was prone to spalling, we strengthened the supports and caps. If the low coal seam had dripping water and the working conditions were difficult, we could still guarantee attendance. Over the years, we have promoted many advanced experiences, such as one-meter seams, four-shift operations, integral conveyor moving, and hydraulic mining. We became a comprehensive coal mining team in 1953. Each shift could mine coal and each shift could prepare. Each worker mastered more than three techniques, such as electric drilling, coal cutting, conveyor laying, and support setting. Therefore, we have overfulfilled the state plan for several years and have been gloriously rated as an advanced coal mining team of the mine, the province, and the whole country for several consecutive years. Our ability to achieve the above results is mainly the result of the leadership and care of the Party and Chairman Mao.

Vigorously Carry Out Technical Innovation, Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, and Promote the Spirit of Collaboration to Increase Coal Production

Although our coal mining team has made some achievements in recent years, it is still far from the requirements of the Party and the state. With the rapid development of our industry and agriculture, the need for coal is increasing, and our responsibility is also growing. 1959 is a year for our country to strive for a greater leap forward. The Central Committee has listed coal production as one of the four major indicators. We feel that this task is extremely glorious and we must resolutely complete it to lay a good foundation for the Second Five-Year Plan. In the future, we must do the following work well:

First, insist on vigorously carrying out the technical revolution. Use technical revolution methods to change operating conditions. Our technical revolution should first solve the key problems in current production and promote generally effective advanced experiences. Combining the promotion of these experiences, we will unremittingly advance towards the cutting-edge technology of hydraulic mining. This will continuously improve production efficiency, save equipment, reduce material consumption rates, and more importantly, reduce labor intensity and ensure safe production.

Second, vigorously carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy and the red banner competition centered on the "three highs" (high yield, high quality, high efficiency). Use the competition method to improve workers' awareness and labor enthusiasm, promote production, and improve technical level. The method of competition is: first formulate advanced indicators that meet the requirements of the three highs, and then launch competitions between shifts and between groups. After the competition is launched, carefully study the measures to achieve the competition conditions according to the specific conditions, so that the measures are implemented, the masses are clear in their minds, the goals are clear, and the creativity and labor enthusiasm of each person are brought into play, thereby ensuring the completion of the production task.

Third, promote the spirit of collaboration. We must advance side by side with brother mines and brother coal mining teams, improve together, and jointly strive for the development of our country's coal industry. When I go back, I will prepare to learn and promote the advanced experience of brother coal mines more, and at the same time, I will actively and proactively introduce our experience to brother mines and teams, help each other, and improve together, in order to facilitate the rapid development of the coal industry.

I am very happy to be able to speak at such a conference today. I used to herd pigs for others when I was a child, and I never read a book for a day. In 1941, because my hometown, Liuchunzhuang, Tai'an County, Shandong Province, suffered from floods and the devastation of the Japanese devils, I fled to the Laotougou Coal Mine in Northeast China. At the age of fifteen, I was carrying coal underground, living a miserable life of being unable to eat my fill and keep warm until the liberation of Northeast China, when I finally saw the light of day. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party have I had the happy days of today. Encouraged by the glorious political tasks, I, a coal worker, am working harder and harder to create a better future, and I guarantee to work hard to study, strive to produce, and continue to advance without any slackness.

Indian Expansionists Need to Clear Their Heads; The Chinese People Who Have Stood Up Are Not to Be Bullied

Finally, I would like to express our workers' attitude on the Tibet issue. Tibet has been an inalienable part of our Chinese territory since ancient times. The imperialists and Indian expansionists dare to support the armed rebellion of the former Tibetan local government and the upper reactionary group, openly distribute the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" by Indian diplomatic officials, and recently the Bombay police authorities in India connived at "demonstrators" to insult the portrait of Chairman Mao in front of our consulate. All these conspiracies and provocative acts of rudely interfering in China's internal affairs, attempting to split China, and insulting the portrait of our leader are absolutely intolerable to us. We solemnly warn the Indian expansionists to clear their heads. The 650 million Chinese people who have stood up are not to be bullied.

### 努力学习　努力生产　继续跃进  宗希云代表的发言

    努力学习　努力生产　继续跃进
    宗希云代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，并保证在今后实际工作中积极努力，认真贯彻执行。
    我是吉林省蛟河煤矿六井的工人，现在担任六○一采煤队的不脱离生产的队长。在这个大会上我想汇报一下我们采煤队的情况。
    以钢为纲大跃进思想生产双丰收
    一九五八年吉林省的煤炭生产，在党的社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在以钢为纲，全面跃进方针的带动下，提前二十六天超额完成了一千零一万吨跃进指标，生产量比一九五七年增长了百分之五十点六，这一年增长的指数比第一个五年计划期间增长的总和还多六十二万吨。上缴利润二千六百四十五万元，比年初计划增长了一倍。煤炭的基本建设和煤田地质勘探等工作，在这一年里也都取得了重大的成就，为一九五九年更大跃进奠定了有利的基础。我们蛟河煤矿在一九五八年中也超额完成了跃进计划，原煤生产年初计划是一百零八万吨。职工们经过伟大的整风运动，提高了觉悟，发挥了冲天的干劲，用实干和巧干的精神，完成了一百四十四万五千吨，降低成本七十六万四千元，获得了思想生产双丰收。
    我们六○一采煤队是在一九五二年建立的，开始领导上叫我担任队长时，我感到能力不足，在工作上遇到了不少困难。由于党的领导，紧紧地依靠群众，困难终于一个一个的被克服了。全体队员听党的话，敢于向困难作斗争，顶板破碎我们就多打顶子，加大顶帽子；高煤层容易片帮，我们就加强支帮顶子；矮煤层有淋头水，工作条件困难，我们都能保证出勤。几年来我们推广了许多先进经验，像一公尺层、四班作业、整体挪溜子、水力采煤等。我们在一九五三年就成为综合采煤队，哪个班都能采煤，哪个班也能准备，每个工人都掌握了三种以上的技术，如电钻打眼、开截煤机、铺溜子、棚棚子等。因此几年来都超额完成了国家计划，并光荣地连续被评为矿的、省的和全国的先进采煤队。我们能够取得上述成绩，主要是党和毛主席领导和关怀的结果。
    大闹技术革新开展增产节约  发扬协作精神提高煤炭产量
    几年来我们采煤队虽然有一些成绩，但离党和国家的要求还差得很远。我们工农业这样飞速的发展，对煤炭的需要越来越多，我们责任也越来越大了。一九五九年是我国争取更大跃进的一年，中央将煤炭生产列为四大指标之一，我们感到这个任务极为光荣，一定坚决完成，为第二个五年计划打好基础。今后要做好以下工作：
    一、坚持大闹技术革命。用技术革命的方法改变作业条件。我们的技术革命首先是解决当前生产中的关键问题，推广一般行之有效的先进经验。结合这些经验的推广，坚持不懈地向采煤尖端技术的水力采煤进军。这样就会不断地提高生产效率，节省设备，降低材料消耗率，更重要的是能够减轻劳动强度，保证安全生产。
    二、大力开展增产节约运动和以三高（高产、高质、高效率）为中心的红旗竞赛。用竞赛的方法提高工人觉悟和劳动积极性，促进生产，提高技术水平。竞赛的方法是：先订出符合三高要求的先进指标，然后开展起班与班、组与组的竞赛。在竞赛掀起后，就根据具体条件细致地研究实现竞赛条件的措施，使措施落实，群众心中有数，目标明确，发挥每个人的创造性和劳动积极性，从而保证生产任务的完成。
    三、发扬协作精神。要与兄弟井、兄弟采煤队并肩前进，共同提高，为我国煤炭事业的发展共同奋斗。我回去准备更多地学习和推广兄弟煤矿的先进经验，同时我也要积极主动地向兄弟矿、队介绍我们的经验，互相帮助，共同提高，以利煤炭工业的迅速发展。
    我今天能在这样的大会上发言，真是非常高兴。我从小就给人家放猪，一天书也没有念过。一九四一年因为当时我的家乡山东泰安县刘春庄遭受水灾和日本鬼子的摧残，就逃荒到东北老头沟煤矿，十五岁就在井下背煤，过着吃不饱、穿不暖的悲惨生活，一直熬到东北解放，才见了天日。只有在共产党的领导下，我才得到今天幸福的日子，我这个煤炭工人，在光荣的政治任务鼓舞下，为了创造美好的未来，越干越有劲，保证毫不懈怠地努力学习，努力生产，继续前进。
    印度扩张主义分子头脑要清醒些  站起来的中国人民不是好欺侮的
    最后，我想就西藏问题，表示一下我们工人的态度。西藏自古以来就是我们中国领土不可分割的一部分，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，胆敢操持原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团武装叛乱，和公然由印度外交官员散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，以及最近印度孟买警察当局纵容“示威者”在我国领事馆前侮辱毛主席像，所有这些粗暴干涉中国内政、妄图分裂中国的阴谋与侮辱我国领袖像的挑衅行为，是我们所绝对不能容忍的。我们严正地警告印度扩张主义分子，头脑要放清醒些，站立起来了的六亿五千万中国人民，不是好欺侮的。
