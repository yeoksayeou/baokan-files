Comprehensively Implement the Party's Education Policy
Committee Member Sun Shuzhi Introduces the Comprehensive Leap Forward of Harbin Jingwei Primary School

Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and Vice-Chairman Li Weihan's CPPCC work report, and I am determined to implement them in my work.

In 1958, China's education work, like other production fronts, experienced a leap forward and achieved great successes. In the era of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland, Harbin Jingwei Primary School, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, and on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement, resolutely and comprehensively implemented the Party's education policy. Guided by the general line, with the education policy as the guiding principle, and with the goal of comprehensively improving the quality of education, we vigorously strengthened political education and work-study programs, reformed and strengthened teaching, and closely integrated school education with social political struggles and productive labor. We overcame the phenomenon of "teaching behind closed doors," and all aspects of the school showed a new situation of comprehensive improvement and a comprehensive leap forward. Now I would like to report on the main achievements of our school's work in 1958.

      Strengthen Ideological and Political Education, Cultivate
  Children's Socialist and Communist Consciousness from an Early Age

First, vigorously strengthen ideological and political education: In order to cultivate in children from an early age socialist and communist ideological consciousness, a class viewpoint, a labor viewpoint, a mass viewpoint, a collectivist viewpoint, and a dialectical materialist viewpoint, we proceeded from the actual thinking of children, initially achieving the integration of theory and practice, and the unity of knowledge and practice. We placed socialist and communist education in the primary position, and forcefully implemented it in all school work. In order to systematically conduct political and ideological education for children, cultivate their concern for politics from an early age, and enable them to treat things with correct ideological viewpoints and enthusiastically participate in political life, we universally added political classes in each grade, and strengthened education on current events and policies. We often combined this with the Party's guidelines and policies and new ideas and things in social life to educate students. For example, the great rectification movement, the anti-Rightist struggle, cadres going to the mountains and countryside to participate in labor training, the promulgation of the general line for socialist construction, various miracles on the industrial and agricultural production fronts since the Great Leap Forward, new people and new things, the entire Party and all the people engaging in iron and steel production, the people's commune movement, and the international situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, were all promptly used to educate students through activities such as class meetings, wall newspapers, poetry and painting galleries, story meetings, report meetings, visits, film screenings, seminars, and debates. For example, activities centered on learning from labor model Su Guangming, visits to workers, farmers, and Party and government leaders, enabled students to promptly understand events happening at home and abroad, and their thoughts and feelings changed with the motherland's ever-changing developments. Therefore, a trend of caring about politics and current events gradually formed among the children. They were cheered and told each other about every achievement made by our great motherland, actively participated in social activities, and proactively promoted the Party's guidelines and policies. For example, after studying the general line and the people's commune issue, students in Class 4 of Grade 5 took the initiative to rehearse a literary program to promote it in a people-run factory, which was very well received.

In teaching, combine with political struggle and productive labor, and integrate book knowledge, practical observation, and guiding children's practice

Secondly, in all subject teaching, we also more closely combined with political struggle and productive labor, and integrated book knowledge, practical observation, and guiding children's practice. Before the high tide of rural people's communes, when teaching the lesson "The Superiority of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" in the sixth grade's socialist course, teachers organized students to visit more than a dozen farmers in an agricultural cooperative in advance, and participated in the cooperative's labor. This allowed the children to see the vibrant new face of the countryside with their own eyes and hear the farmers' stories, giving them a practical experience and a deeper understanding of the superiority of agricultural cooperation. After returning, the Young Pioneers brigade held a team meeting entitled "Let's All Support the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Production Program," discussed it, and made a resolution to support agricultural production with the practical action of accumulating 12,000 catties of fertilizer. Many children showed unparalleled enthusiasm in the fertilizer accumulation movement. Comrade Li Yongsheng, in order to accumulate more fertilizer, signed a contract with the manager of a nearby stable, exchanging his daily cleaning of the stable for the manure inside. Because of his active efforts in the fertilizer accumulation movement, he was selected as a fertilizer accumulation activist. Many students put forward the slogan "A basket of manure before meals." One student even wrote a poem:

"Get up early in the morning to pick manure,
Pick a large basket full,
Support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture,
Not afraid of frozen ground or cold weather."

For example, when teaching the comparison of workers' lives in the past and present in the second grade, we conducted on-site teaching at Thirty-Six Sheds (a slum before liberation). When teaching the lesson "Night School" in the third grade, teachers led the children to attend classes at the Jingwei Street Civic Night School, visited outstanding students, and then organized them to participate in literacy work, serving as "little teachers," etc. Such teaching not only allowed children to learn knowledge, but also gave them a practical experience of the living reality, educated them, and cultivated their love for the Party and socialism. In the process of practice, political and ideological education was further deepened. This gradually formed children's beliefs and conscious behavior. In order to promote the all-round development of students, we also launched the "Six Red Students" and "Six Red Classes" competitions among students. At the end of 1958, 33% of the "Six Red Classes" and 10% of the "Six Red" students were selected, which played a great role in encouraging children to be active and progressive. Over the course of a year, children's communist moral qualities continued to grow, and good deeds emerged endlessly.

The prominent feature of our school's political and ideological education in 1958 was that it closely integrated school education with the heated social reality, political life, and productive labor, and combined it with the actual thinking of children, and purposefully solved the problems in children's thinking. The role of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology was greatly enhanced, and it also became more diverse.

Plan to guide children to participate in light labor that suits their physical strength and interests, pay attention to combining labor with teaching, and especially conduct ideological and moral education for students

Thirdly, in resolutely implementing the Party's education policy in 1958, we particularly resolutely implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, adopted a mass movement approach to carry out work-study activities, and established 20 small factories, including gold, wood, electricity, chemicals, fertilizers, needles, and paper. There were more in the fields of arts and crafts and science and technology, as well as gardening labor, living labor, and productive labor. In order to better implement the central government's instructions and cultivate children's labor habits from an early age, we have added labor practice courses this year. Over the past year, we have initially explored ways to organize students to participate in labor based on the characteristics of primary schools. In the organization process, we insisted on paying attention to planning and selecting some light labor that suits children's physical strength and interests, and in the labor, we especially paid attention to combining it with teaching. Through labor, students applied the knowledge they learned to practice, and also continuously enriched children's basic knowledge. Through labor observation, we inspired students' intelligence and creativity. For example, the paper flower factory did not simply imitate the paper flowers, but observed and studied the actual flowers many times before making each flower, striving to make each flower the same as the real flower, whether it was the leaves, flowers, color, or shape. In less than a year, students created seventy or eighty kinds of lilies, night-blooming jasmine, roses, chrysanthemums, etc. In this process, students recognized various flowers, various names, and learned about the habits of various flowers and the methods of cultivation. This not only increased knowledge, but also cultivated and developed children's cognitive ability and the ability to correctly and objectively reflect reality. Children's observation, imagination, and creativity have been improved.

In the labor process, we also paid special attention to conducting ideological and moral education for students. Because we clearly recognized that the combination of education and productive labor is a correct path to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. To this end, we used the factory as an educational classroom, and proposed the slogan: "There is no small matter in labor, everywhere is education, the labor process is a complex and meticulous education process." We constantly studied and improved the organizational form of labor, management division, and income distribution, and constantly conducted ideological education for students.

Before organizing students to participate in any kind of labor, we paid great attention to first explaining the significance and role of socialist construction to students, and clarifying the purpose of production. For example, the bacterial fertilizer factory can directly supply the countryside and support agricultural production; the wire-drawing factory is to directly support industrial construction; the processing of straight nails and crushed leather will turn waste into useful materials for society. When students learned that their manual labor could also contribute to socialist construction, it further stimulated their enthusiasm for labor, and they cherished their achievements even more.

In order to better conduct collectivist education for children, we adopted the form of collective labor as the basic form of labor. In each factory, we strictly divided into groups and workshops according to different processes, reflecting the social nature of modern production, thereby cultivating students' selfless, united, and cooperative working-class ideological feelings.

In labor, teachers paid great attention to observing and discovering children's good qualities, and promptly supported, cultivated, and set examples for the sprouts of communist thought. At the same time, they also paid great attention to discovering and understanding some of the problems reflected by children in labor, and promptly adopted various methods for education.

In order to consolidate children's labor habits and interests, and promote the spirit of creation, we constantly put forward new topics in labor and encouraged students' inventions and creations, and the spirit of daring to speak, dare to think, and dare to do.

In the labor process, teachers and students worked together, and while giving play to the guiding role of teachers, they also combined it with cultivating students' ability to work independently and manage production. The director, administrator, material officer, and inspector of each factory were all students who could consciously perform their duties. Therefore, before each start of work, they planned and allocated production tasks and tools and materials, and at the end of work, they also carefully checked and registered, so that production could proceed in an orderly manner. Now many students have learned to reasonably allocate production tasks, master labor time, deploy labor, and conduct evaluations in labor and other management capabilities.

In addition to strengthening ideological and knowledge education for children in labor, we also paid special attention to integrating all school education activities with productive labor, that is, to combine labor with extracurricular activities, labor with daily life, and labor with education.

A year of practice has made us realize that to truly combine education with productive labor, it is necessary to implement the Party's policy in every specific business, in all education activities, at all times and in all matters. Because this is a new work, our experience is still insufficient and needs to be further explored and studied in the future.

Children's ideological awareness has been greatly improved, their labor viewpoints have been greatly enhanced, and the quality of learning has also been improved on the original basis.

In short, in the process of organizing students to participate in labor, we fully played the role of labor as a classroom for communist education. In this classroom, communist thought is arming the younger generation of children, so children's political awareness has been greatly improved, their labor viewpoints have been greatly enhanced, and the idea that students do not love labor and despise labor has been reversed. Love for labor has formed a children's fashion and public opinion, and children's thoughts and feelings have undergone profound changes due to participation in labor.

A sixth-grade girl once wrote the following sentence in her diary: "In the past, whenever I saw a manure cart, I would cover my nose and hide far away, but now when I see a pile of manure from a distance, I immediately run over and pick it up like a treasure..." From this, we can see the tremendous changes in children's thoughts and feelings brought about by labor. In the past, there was often a phenomenon of shirking work during labor, but now we often find vivid examples of those who were not assigned to work secretly sneaking into the ranks of labor.

In order to thoroughly and comprehensively implement the Party's education policy, in addition to carrying out work-study activities and vigorously strengthening political and ideological education, we have also strengthened teaching work, so the quality of students' learning has also been improved on the original basis. The graduates of 1958 not only showed outstanding progress in political awareness and labor, but also improved in the quality of knowledge. The admission rate for graduation and further education reached 96%. Students' writing ability has been greatly improved. In the essay contest organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, the selected excellent works accounted for 13% of the city, and the content truthfully reflected the children's attitude towards labor and social activities, and was full of thoughts and feelings of loving the Party and loving socialism.

Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party, after the victory of the rectification movement and our serious and resolute implementation of the Party's education policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, we have gained a lot in changing the face of the school, changing the mental outlook of teachers, and changing the spirit of students. Teachers' political awareness has been significantly improved, bourgeois ideas have been greatly weakened, proletarian ideas have been greatly enhanced, the Party's leading position in the school has been further consolidated, teachers' political enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high, and they have actively participated in the Party's various movements and social activities. The teachers' collective has become more united and strong, the atmosphere of mutual help and mutual cooperation has been established, and the communist labor attitude has been basically established. Advanced elements among teachers are constantly emerging and are moving forward on the road of becoming both red and expert.

Over the past year, students have developed in terms of intelligence, morality, and physical education, and have been repeatedly rewarded and commended by the Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal Party Committee's Culture and Education Department, the Education Bureau, the District Committee, and the Youth League Committee, and have been given the honorary titles of Red Flag School and Advanced Collective. This is the victory of the Party's education policy, the victory of the Party's leadership in education work. Now all the faculty and staff of our school are, under the leadership of the Party, going to muster greater efforts, continue to deeply and comprehensively implement the Party's education policy, and comprehensively improve the quality of education, so as to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

I wish the conference a successful success! I wish all the representatives good health.

    从各方面贯彻党的教育方针
    孙淑芝委员介绍哈尔滨经纬小学全面跃进情况主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心拥护周总理所做的政府工作报告和李维汉副主席所做的政协工作报告，并坚决在工作中贯彻执行。
    一九五八年我国教育工作和其他生产战线一样也有了飞跃的发展，取得了巨大的成绩。哈尔滨市经纬小学在祖国大跃进的年代里，由于党的正确领导，在整风胜利的基础上，坚决地深入全面地贯彻了党的教育方针，并以总路线为指导思想，以教育方针为纲，全面提高教育质量为目的，大力加强了政治教育和勤工俭学活动，改革与加强了教学工作，使学校教育与社会政治斗争、生产劳动密切结合，克服了关门教书的现象，学校各方面出现了一个全面提高全面跃进的新局面。现在我把我校一九五八年工作中的主要收获汇报一下。
      加强思想政治教育，从小就培养
  儿童具有社会主义共产主义觉悟
    第一，大力加强思想政治教育：为了从儿童时代开始就培养他们具有社会主义共产主义思想觉悟，具有阶级观点，劳动观点，群众观点，集体主义观点和辩证唯物主义观点，我们从儿童思想实际出发，初步做到理论与实际联系、认识和实践统一，把社会主义共产主义教育放在首要地位，有力的贯彻到学校全部工作中去。为了系统地向儿童进行政治思想教育，培养他们自幼就关心政治，并且能够以正确的思想观点去对待事物和热心参加政治生活，我们在各学年普遍的增设了政治课，加强了时事政策教育。并经常以结合党的方针政策社会生活中的新思想新事物去教育学生。如：伟大的整风运动，反右派斗争，干部上山下乡参加劳动锻炼，社会主义建设总路线的公布，大跃进以来工农业生产战线的各种奇迹，新人新事，全党全民大搞钢铁，人民公社化运动，以及东风压倒西风的国际局势等都是及时地通过班队活动、墙报、诗画廊、故事会、报告会、参观访问、看电影、座谈会、辩论会等形式向学生进行教育。如：举办的向劳动模范苏广铭学习为中心的活动月，访问工人、农民、党政首长等活动，让学生及时的了解国内外发生的一些事件，并且使他们的思想感情随着祖国日新月异的变化而变化，因此在儿童中关心政治，关心时事的风气逐渐形成，并且为我们伟大的祖国所取得的每一件成就而欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，积极参加社会活动，主动的宣传党的方针政策。如：五年四班学生学习总路线人民公社问题之后，主动的排练了文艺节目到民办工厂去宣传，很受欢迎。
    在教学中与政治斗争结合，与生产劳动结合，并把书本知识、实际观察和指导儿童实践三者结合起来
    其次，在各科教学中也更紧密的与政治斗争结合，与生产劳动结合，并把书本知识，实际观察和指导儿童实践三者结合起来。在农村人民公社化高潮之前，六年级社会主义课讲“农业生产合作化的优越性”一课，事先教师曾组织学生到一个农业社去参观访问了十几家农民，并参加了农业社的劳动，使孩子们亲眼看到蓬勃发展的农村新面貌，和听到了农民的讲述，使他们对农业合作化的优越性，有了实际的体验和更深刻的理解，回来后少先队中队又以“咱们大家都来支援农业生产纲要四十条”为题的队会，经过讨论并做出了决议，要以积肥一万二千斤的实际行动，支援农业生产，很多孩子在积肥运动中表现了无比的热情，李永盛同学为了多积肥和邻近的马棚管理人订合同，交换条件，是“每天他去打扫马棚，里边的粪归他所有”，由于他在积肥运动中积极努力被选为积肥积极分子。许多学生提出“饭前一筐粪”的口号，一个学生还编了一首诗歌：
    “清晨早起把粪拣，一拣拣满一大筐，
    支援农业大跃进，不怕地冻和天寒。”
    再如：二年级讲工人今昔生活对比时，到三十六棚去进行现场教学（该处在解放前是贫民窟）。三年级教学讲“夜校”一课时，教师领儿童到经纬街市民夜校去听课，访问优秀学员，然后又组织他们参加扫盲工作，当小先生等，这样的教学儿童不但学会了知识，而且对活生生的现实生活有了实际的体验，受到了教育，培养对党和社会主义的热爱感情，在实践过程中，又使政治思想教育更深刻化了。这样逐渐地形成儿童的信念和自觉行为。为促进学生的全面发展，我们又在学生中展开了“六红学生”、“六红班级”的评比，在一九五八年末评比出百分之三十三的“六红班级”和百分之十的“六红”学生，对于鼓励儿童的积极进取起了很大作用。在一年过程中儿童中的共产主义道德品质不断成长，好人好事层出不穷。
    一九五八年我校政治思想教育方面突出的特点就是使学校教育和热火朝天的社会现实生活，政治生活，劳动生产密切结合起来，和儿童的思想实际结合起来，并且有的放矢的解决儿童思想中的问题，兴无灭资政治思想教育的作用大大增强，而且也更加丰富多采。
    有计划地指导儿童参加适合体力和有兴趣的轻微劳动，在劳动中注意结合教学，并特别向学生进行思想品德教育
    第二，在一九五八年坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针过程中，我们特别是坚决贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，采取群众运动的方式开展了勤工俭学活动，办了二十个小工厂，包括：金、木、电、化、肥、针、纸几种工种，其中工艺科技方面的较多，还有园艺劳动，生活劳动，生产劳动，为更好的贯彻中央的指示，培养儿童自幼养成劳动习惯，今年我们又增添了劳动实习课，一年来在实践中初步摸索到根据小学特点组织学生参加劳动的途径。在组织过程中，坚持注意了有计划地选择一些适合儿童体力和兴趣的轻微劳动，并在劳动中我们特别注意与教学结合，通过劳动使学生所学的知识运用于实际，同时也不断地丰富儿童的基础知识，并且通过劳动观察启发学生的智力和创造性。如：纸花工厂所做的纸花都不是简单的模仿，而且在做每一种花之前都经过多次的实际花卉的观察和研究，力求每一种花无论是花叶，花朵颜色形状都和真花一样，不到一年的时间里，学生们就创作出百合，夜来香，月季，菊花等七、八十种，在这个过程中学生认识了各种花卉，各种名称，知道了各种花卉的习性，以及培植的方法，这不仅增长了知识，而且也培养和发展了儿童的认识能力，和正确地、客观地反映现实的能力，儿童的观察力、想象力、创造力得到了提高。
    在劳动过程中我们也特别注意向学生进行思想品德教育，由于我们清楚认识到教育与生产劳动的结合是培养有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者的一条正确道路。为此，我们把工厂作为教育的课堂，并提出：劳动无小事，处处是教育，劳动的过程就是复杂、细致的教育过程的口号，结合劳动的组织形式、管理分工、收益分配等问题，随时随地研究与改进，并不断的对学生进行思想教育。
    在组织学生参加任何一种劳动之前，都非常注意首先向学生讲清意义以及对社会主义建设的作用，明确生产目的。如：细菌肥料厂能直接供应农村支援农业生产；车丝工厂是为了直接支援工业建设；直钉、碎皮的加工会把废物变成对社会有用的材料等。当学生了解到他们双手劳动也能为社会主义建设作出贡献时，就更加激发了他们的劳动热情，他们就更加珍惜自己的成果。
    为了更好的向儿童进行集体主义教育，我们采取集体劳动的形式，为劳动的基本形式，在每一个工厂里又按工序的不同，严密的分成小组、车间、体现现代生产的社会性，从而培养学生大公无私，团结协作的工人阶级思想感情。
    在劳动中，教师们非常注意观察和发现儿童们的优良品质，对于共产主义思想的萌芽，及时的给以扶植，培养，树立榜样。同时也非常注意和发现了解儿童在劳动中所反映的一些问题。及时的采取各种办法进行教育。
    为巩固儿童的劳动习惯和兴趣，发扬创造精神，在劳动中又不断提出新的课题并鼓励学生的发明创造，敢说敢想敢做的精神。
    在劳动过程中，教师和学生共同劳动，并且在发挥教师的指导作用的同时，又和培养学生独立工作，和管理生产的能力，结合起来，每个工厂的厂长、管理员、材料员、检查员等都由学生担当，都能自觉的守职尽责，因而他们在每次开工之前上班，计划与分配生产任务和工具材料，收工时还要认真进行检查登记，使生产有条不紊的进行，现在有很多学生在生产劳动过程中，学会了合理的分配生产任务，掌握劳动时间，调配劳动力，以及在劳动中进行评比等管理能力。
    除了在劳动中加强对儿童的思想知识教育以外，我们又特别注意使学校的全部教育活动，与生产劳动结合起来，也就是做到劳动与课外活动相结合，劳动与日常生活结合，劳动与教育结合。
    一年来的实践，使我们认识到，要真正的使教育和生产劳动结合起来，必须时时刻刻，处处事事，都要在具体业务中，在全部教育活动中，都要贯彻党的这一方针。由于这是一项新的工作，我们的经验还很不足，有待于今后进一步的摸索和研究。
    儿童思想觉悟大大提高，劳动观点大大增强，学习质量也在原有基础上提高一步
    总之，在组织学生参加劳动的过程中充分的发挥了劳动做为共产主义教育课堂的作用，在这个课堂里，共产主义的思想在武装着少年儿童一代，因而儿童的政治觉悟大大提高，劳动观点大大增强，扭转了学生不爱劳动，轻视劳动的思想，爱劳动形成了儿童风尚舆论，儿童的思想感情由于参加劳动起了深刻的变化。
    六年级的一个女同学曾在日记本上写过这样一句话：“过去一看见粪车，掩着鼻子远远地躲开了，而现在当远远地看到一堆粪的时候，我就立刻奔过去，把它象宝贝似的拾起来……”从这里可以看到劳动使儿童们在思想感情上起着巨大的变化。从前劳动时常有溜号的现象，现在都常常发现有未被指定的，又偷偷地溜到劳动行列里等生动的事例不胜枚举。
    为深入全面的贯彻党的教育方针，我们除了开展勤工俭学活动，大力加强政治思想教育外，同时也加强了教学工作，因而学生的学习质量也在原有的基础上提高了一步。五八年毕业生不仅在政治觉悟、劳动等方面表现出突出的进步，而且在知识质量上也有提高，毕业升学考试的录取率，达到百分之九十六。学生的写作能力大大提高。在市教育局所组织的征文活动中，被选为优秀作品占全市百分之十三，其内容都是真实的反映出儿童对劳动、社会活动的态度，充满了热爱党、热爱社会主义的思想感情。
    一年来在党的领导下，经过整风运动的胜利和我们认真的，坚决的，贯彻了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，在改变学校面貌、改变教师精神面貌、改变学生精神方面有很大收获。教师的政治觉悟显著提高，资产阶级思想大大削弱，无产阶级思想大大增强，党在学校中的领导地位，更加巩固，教师的政治热情空前高涨，积极的参加党的各项运动和社会活动，教师的集体更加团结坚强、互相帮助、互相协作之风，共产主义劳动态度，基本树立起来，教师中的先进分子不断的涌现出来，正在往红专道路前进。
    一年来学生在智育、德育、体育等方面得到发展，曾几次的受到市人委、市委文教部、教育局、区委以及团委等多次的奖励和表扬，并给予红旗学校先进集体的光荣称号，这是党的教育方针的胜利，党对教育工作领导的胜利，现在我校全体教职员工正在党的领导下，要鼓起更大的干劲，继续深入的，全面的，贯彻党的教育方针，全面的提高教育质量，以实现更大更好更全面的跃进。祝大会胜利成功！各位代表身体健康。
