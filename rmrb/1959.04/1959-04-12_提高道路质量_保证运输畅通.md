Improve Road Quality and Ensure Smooth Transportation
Director of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Lian Baisheng

Over the past year, the national highway transportation departments have built 150,000 kilometers of new roads and rebuilt more than 40,000 kilometers of roads. They have also built many wide carriageways, pack animal trails, wooden rail tracks, slides, and cableways. The construction of these roads has not only improved highway transportation, but also enabled us to find ways to rapidly develop road construction from the great leap forward in highway construction.

This year, highway transportation will continue its great leap forward. In addition to continuing to build new routes, we should focus on improving the quality of roads and ensuring smooth transportation. This is an important task for highway transportation departments at present. In the first half of this year, transportation departments in various regions should strengthen the maintenance and improvement of existing highways. On the one hand, it is necessary to improve the technical conditions of trunk highways and increase their carrying capacity. On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the maintenance and improvement of branch highways, especially to improve the quality of newly built roads last year, in order to meet the needs of short-distance transportation. The reason why we want to do this is mainly because the quality of highway technical conditions directly affects the performance of motor vehicle transportation efficiency. If the speed of motor vehicles is accelerated, the economic effect of vehicle use will be better, which is equivalent to increasing a large number of motor vehicles. If the highway is always flat and firm, it will reduce the consumption of motor vehicle fuel and the wear of parts.

To do a good job in road maintenance and improvement, we should first remove steep slopes and sharp bends on busy transportation routes, and widen narrow roadbeds and pavements into two-lane roads so that motor vehicle trains can pass. For earth roads without pavement, various local sand, stone, brick materials, sintered soil, and slag should be used to pave the road surface. In particular, trunk lines and routes to important industrial and mining bases must ensure that vehicles can travel smoothly in both sunny and rainy weather. For ferries with large traffic volumes, bridges or pontoon bridges should be built or continuous boat ferries should be promoted in accordance with the principle of using local materials, so that motor vehicle trains can be transported smoothly. Guardrails should be added to dangerous sections of mountain roads. Reflective equipment should be added to highway signs on routes with more night traffic. A general inspection should be carried out on newly built roads, and dangerous sections such as mud pumping, subsidence, collapse, water damage, and lack of bridges and culverts should be eliminated as soon as possible.

To do a good job in road maintenance and improvement, a mass road maintenance team must be established. According to the experience of various regions, it is necessary to establish a professional road maintenance team with the people's commune as the unit. This will not only ensure the source of road maintenance personnel, but also give play to the enthusiasm of the masses in road construction and maintenance, and cultivate a large number of technical backbones for road construction and maintenance in the vast rural areas, which will help promote the development of local road construction. At present, many regions have reorganized and newly established professional road maintenance organizations by communes on the basis of the original agricultural cooperative road maintenance teams; some regions have also begun to decentralize highway trunk lines to people's communes for maintenance, and the original road maintenance workers have also been decentralized to communes to strengthen highway maintenance and management. It should be pointed out that the highway transportation department's incorporation of road maintenance work into the commune's labor plan for unified arrangement is in line with the party's and the people's policy of running transportation.

This year, in addition to improving and strengthening the maintenance of existing highways, highway transportation departments in various regions also have a heavy task of building new roads. In the construction of new roads, we must fully estimate the characteristics of the very busy county and township branch line transportation after the development of industry and agriculture and the communization of the people. There should be comprehensive planning for the construction of county and township branch lines. In particular, remote mountainous areas need to continue to change the closed situation of transportation. Mountainous areas account for about 80% of the country's total area. Opening up mountain roads will help the economic development of vast mountainous areas and improve people's lives. In particular, it is necessary to closely link highway trunk lines with branch lines to concentrate materials for highway trunk lines and to make motor vehicles directly reach mining areas to serve production.

In road construction, highway transportation departments in various regions must ensure to improve project quality and speed up construction. Therefore, when mobilizing the masses to participate in road construction, it is necessary to strengthen leadership, make plans, and propose technical standards to prevent neglecting the principles of project quality and economic applicability. To ensure project quality, there must also be a certain technical force. At present, there is a shortage of technical personnel for surveying and design work. In addition to organizing the existing technical force as much as possible to participate in the mass road construction movement and provide technical guidance, the highway transportation departments in various regions mainly rely on the masses. In many areas, farmers' surveying teams are organized in road surveying and design, learning while surveying, from shallow to deep, thereby breaking through the surveying barrier. In terms of construction, in addition to fully preparing for construction and strengthening organization and management, we should also use methods such as running "experimental fields", repairing demonstration road sections, opening on-site training courses, and adopting the combination of leaders, workers, and technicians to ensure project quality. Road construction materials should be obtained locally and self-reliantly, and should be requested from the state as little as possible or not at all.

This year's road maintenance, improvement and construction tasks are very heavy. However, we believe that under the leadership of the local party committees and relying on the broad masses, the highway transportation departments in various regions will continue to thoroughly implement the policy of the whole party and the people running transportation, then the road maintenance, improvement and construction projects will definitely be able to meet the requirements of more, faster, better and more economical, and will play a greater role in ensuring smooth transportation.

### 提高道路质量　保证运输畅通

　　提高道路质量　保证运输畅通
　　交通部公路总局局长　连柏生
    一年来，全国公路交通部门新建公路十五万公里，改建公路四万多公里，还修建了许多大车道、驮运道、木轨道、滑道和索道等。这些道路的建设，不仅改进了公路运输，而且使我们从公路建设的大跃进中，找到了迅速发展道路建设的途径。
    今年的公路运输要继续大跃进，除了继续建设新的路线外，应特别抓紧提高道路的质量，保证运输畅通，这是当前公路交通部门的重要工作。今年上半年，各地交通部门要加强对现有公路的养护和改善。一方面要改善干线公路的技术状况，提高通过能力；另一方面要加强支线公路的养护和改善，特别要提高去年新建道路的质量，以适应短途运输的需要。我们所以要这样做，主要是因为公路技术状况的好坏，直接影响着汽车运输效能的发挥。如果汽车的行驶速度加快，车辆使用的经济效果就好，就等于增加大批汽车。如果公路经常平整坚实，又会减少汽车燃料的消耗和机件的磨损。
    要做好道路的养护和改善工作，应尽先去掉运输繁忙路线的陡坡和急弯，把狭窄的路基、路面加宽成双车道，使汽车列车能通行。对没有铺路面的土路，要利用当地的各种砂、石、砖料和烧结土、矿碴等，把路面铺好。特别是干线和通往重要工矿基地的路线，必须保证车辆能晴雨畅通。对通过量大的渡口，应本着就地取材的原则，修建桥梁或浮桥，或推行连船渡运，使汽车列车能顺利渡运。山区道路险要地段，要添设护拦。夜间行车较多的路线，要把公路标志添设反光设备。对新建的道路，应该进行一次普遍检查，发现翻浆、沉陷、坍方、水毁和缺少桥涵等危险地段，应尽快设法消除。
    要做好道路养护和改善工作，必须建立一支群众性的养路队伍。根据各地的经验，需要建立以人民公社为单位的专业养路队伍。这样不但可以保证养路人员的来源，而且可以发挥人民群众的修路养路的积极性，可以在广大农村中培养大批修路养路的技术骨干，有助于促进地方公路建设事业的发展。现在很多地区，已在原有农业社养路队的基础上，由公社重新整顿和新建了专业养路组织；还有些地区开始把公路干线也下放到人民公社养护，原有的养路工人也下放到公社，以加强公路的养护和管理。应当指出，公路交通部门把养路工作纳入公社劳动计划进行统一的安排，是符合全党全民办交通的方针的。
    今年，各地公路交通部门，除对已有的公路进行改善和加强养护之外，新建道路的任务也很繁重。建设新道路，要充分估计到工农业的发展和人民公社化以后县乡支线运输十分繁忙的特点。对县乡支线的建设，要有全面规划。特别是偏僻的山区，需要继续改变交通的闭塞情况。我国山区约占全国总面积的80％，这些山区的资源丰富，开辟山区道路，将有助于广大山区经济的发展和人民生活的提高。特别是要使公路干线与支线紧密地联结起来，为公路干线集中物资，并使汽车直通矿区，为生产服务。
    各地公路交通部门在道路建设上，要保证提高工程质量和加快建设速度。因此，要在发动群众参加修路工作的时候，加强领导，做好规划，并提出技术标准，防止忽视工程质量和经济适用的原则。要保证工程质量，还要有一定的技术力量。当前测量设计工作的技术人员不足，各地公路交通部门除了尽可能地把现有的技术力量组织起来，参加群众修路运动，进行技术指导外，更主要的是依靠群众。不少地区在道路测量设计中，组织农民测量队，边测边学，由浅入深，从而攻破了测量关。在施工方面，除了要充分作好施工准备，加强组织管理外，还应该用办“试验田”、修示范路段、开现场训练班，以及采取领导、工人与技术人员三结合等等办法来保证工程质量。筑路材料应该采取就地取材，自力更生的原则，尽可能少要或不向国家要材料。
    今年道路的养护、改善和修建任务是十分繁重的。但是，我们相信，各地公路交通部门在当地党委的领导下，依靠广大群众，继续深入贯彻全党全民办交通的方针，那末，道路的养护、改善和修建工程，就一定能够达到多快好省的要求，对保证运输畅通，将会起到更大的作用。
