Xinhua News Agency, April 13th -- In the past few months, various regions have further expanded their irrigated area in the winter water conservancy campaign, renovated existing irrigation projects, and enabled these projects to play a better role. Now that the busy spring planting season has arrived in some areas, the winter water conservancy shock campaign is about to transition into year-round construction activities carried out by professional teams.

In this winter water conservancy campaign, various regions continued to implement the "three main" principles of "storage as the main focus, small-scale projects as the main component, and commune-run projects as the main force." However, in areas where small-scale projects are already widespread, more large-scale backbone projects have been added. All regions paid close attention to quality during the winter repairs. While building a large number of new water conservancy projects, they also renovated and improved some irrigation projects built last year that had not been able to function effectively due to insufficient water sources or unfinished field projects. In order to accomplish more work with less manpower, various regions universally launched high-efficiency movements and promoted high-efficiency construction experience. Therefore, the average efficiency of each workday generally increased by half to one times compared to last year.

Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Gansu, and other vast regions, where water conservancy construction experienced a leap forward last winter, have built many new projects this past winter and spring. Among them, there are more medium-sized key backbone projects. Especially in the plains, river network projects have developed. These newly built projects connect some scattered and isolated small projects, creating a more complete drainage and irrigation system, which greatly enhances the irrigation function of water conservancy projects. For example, the six major key projects built by Jiangsu Province, including the Huai-Shu New River, Tong-Yu Canal, Tong-Yang Canal, Tai Pu River, Wu-Hu Canal, and the Grand Canal, are examples of this. Henan Province has newly completed more than 1,000 kilometers of rivers at all levels belonging to the river network, and in some areas, a "long vine bearing melons" type of drainage and irrigation system connecting rivers to reservoirs and reservoirs to canals has begun to form. The low-lying and flood-prone areas in the Kaifeng area have also basically achieved river networking. The river networking in northern Anhui and the mechanization of wells in the plains of Hebei and Shandong have further developed.

Regions that started later last winter and carried out less water conservancy construction, as well as regions that suffered severe droughts in 1958, such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning in the Northeast, and some areas in South China and Southwest China, have shown great determination in leadership and enthusiasm from the masses. The scale and achievements of this winter repair have also been significant. The three northeastern provinces had made early preparations for winter construction, such as adding coverings to the construction sites to maintain ground temperature and building sheds for construction workers. During the construction, the enthusiastic masses not only overcame the ice and cold but also used their wisdom to lay ice tracks to transport soil, greatly improving the speed of construction and achieving great results. For example, Heilongjiang completed more than 3,600 medium and small reservoirs, dug more than 50,000 wells, and opened more than 1,600 artesian springs this past winter and spring. Preliminary statistics show that the irrigated area can be expanded by 7.6 million mu. In addition, in the Zhanjiang area of Guangdong, where the water conservancy foundation is relatively good, the masses have demonstrated a spirit of daring to think and act, solved problems in the five processes of loosening soil, loading soil, lifting soil, unloading soil, and compacting soil in construction, and systematically carried out various technological innovations, further developing the high-efficiency water conservancy movement.

At present, most of the projects completed this year have been filled with water. People's communes in various regions have also organized forces to strengthen irrigation management and water storage and conservation, so that the newly built projects can benefit in the same year. After the spring sowing, most provinces and regions such as Jiangxi, Jilin, and Sichuan will arrange a certain amount of labor to continue construction. Many regions will continue to mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out construction in the future.

### 我国灌溉面积不断扩大  冬修水利工效提高，大部工程已经蓄水

　　我国灌溉面积不断扩大
　　冬修水利工效提高，大部工程已经蓄水
    据新华社13日讯　几个月来，各地在冬修水利运动中进一步扩大了灌溉面积，整修了原有的灌溉工程，使这些工程能更好地发挥作用。现在，春播大忙已到来的地区，冬修水利的突击运动即将转为由专业队伍进行的常年兴修活动。
    在这次水利冬修运动中，各地继续贯彻执行了以蓄为主、以小型为主和社办为主的“三主”方针；但在小型工程已经普遍的地区，较大的骨干工程加多了。各地在冬修中，都很注意质量。在修建大量新的水利工程的同时，整修和改善了去年修建的，但因水源不足、田间工程未作等原因而未及时发挥效益的部分灌溉工程。为了用较少的人力干更多的活计，各地普遍开展了高工效运动，推广了高工效施工经验。因此，每一劳动日的平均工效一般都比去年提高半倍到一倍左右。
    上一个冬季水利建设有飞跃发展的河南、山东、安徽、江苏、甘肃及其他广大地区，去冬今春又修了很多新的工程。其中，中型关键性的骨干工程较多。特别是平原地区，河网化工程有了发展。这些新修工程把一些分散的、孤立的小工程联系起来，建成了较完整的排灌系统，大大地发挥了水利工程的灌溉作用。如江苏省修的淮沭新河、通榆运河、通扬运河、太浦河、芜沪运河和大运河等六大重点工程就是这样。河南全省新完成了属于河网的各级河道一千公里以上，部分地区开始形成河连库、库连渠的长藤结瓜式的排灌系统，开封专区低洼易涝地区也基本实现河网化。安徽淮北河网化以及河北、山东平原的机井化都有进一步的发展。
    上一个冬季动手较晚，兴修水利比较少的地区以及1958年遭受了严重干旱的地区，如东北的黑龙江、吉林、辽宁和华南、西南部分地区，领导决心和群众干劲都很大，这次冬修的规模和成绩也都较大。东北三省对冬季施工早就作了准备，如在施工地段上加了覆盖，设法保持了地温，并为施工人员盖了棚子。施工中热情蓬勃的群众不仅战胜了冰寒，还发挥智慧敷设冰道运土，大大提高了施工的速度，取得了很大成绩。如黑龙江去冬今春就完成了中、小水库三千六百多座，打井五万多眼，开自流泉一千六百多处，初步统计可扩大灌溉面积七百六十万亩。此外，像在水利基础较好的广东湛江地区，群众发挥了敢想敢干的创造精神，解决了施工中松土、装土、上土、卸土、压土等五个工序中的问题，系统地进行各种技术革新，使水利高工效运动有了进一步的发展。
    目前，今年兴修完工的工程大部分已经蓄上水，各地人民公社还组织力量，加强灌溉管理和蓄水保水等工作，使新修的工程当年受益。春播结束后，江西、吉林、四川等大部省区都将安排一定的劳力坚持继续兴修；不少地区将在今后继续发动群众大力兴修。
