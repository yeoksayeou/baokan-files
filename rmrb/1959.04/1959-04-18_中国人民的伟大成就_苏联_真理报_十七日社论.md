The Great Achievements of the Chinese People
　　Soviet "Pravda" Editorial on the 17th

    The People's Republic of China has published the State Statistical Bureau's communique on the results of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan (1953 to 1957) for the development of the national economy and the communique on the development of the Republic's national economy in 1958. The figures cited in these two communiques prove that production in all sectors of the national economy has developed rapidly, and our Chinese brothers have made glorious and heroic achievements. Under the encouragement of the Communist Party's General Line, the Chinese working people ensured the early completion of the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan.
    The first Five-Year Plan was an important milestone on the road to building a strong, socialist industrialized China. In recent years, China has laid the foundation for socialist industrialization and achieved decisive victories in the socialist transformation of agriculture and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Between 1952 and 1957, the proportion of the state-owned economy in national income increased from 19% to 33%, and the proportion of the cooperative economy increased from 1.5% to 56%.
    The Chinese Communist Party, creatively applying the universal laws of socialist construction in combination with its own specific conditions, mobilized 600 million people to vigorously develop the material foundation of the new social system - heavy industry. The main forces and funds were concentrated in this area. 87% of the total industrial investment was used for the development of heavy industry.
    The communique of the State Statistical Bureau of the People's Republic of China points out that during the first Five-Year Plan period, China carried out the construction of 166 major industrial projects with the help of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1957, 68 of them had been fully or partially completed and put into production. The Soviet people, loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, are very happy to help their Chinese brothers and introduce their rich experience to them in order to accelerate the march towards the common great goal - communism.
    In five years, the People's Republic of China has built many new industrial sectors that were unimaginable in the semi-colonial old China. The Chinese people have begun to produce domestically produced aircraft, automobiles, tractors, modern machine tools and various equipment.
    With the emergence of new factories, mines and power stations, China's working class has increased in number and strength. The ranks of the people's scientific and technological intellectuals have grown. In 1957, China's engineering and technical personnel reached 175,000, an increase of two-fold compared with 1952. Now, Chinese engineers and technicians are able to design their own iron and steel complexes, coal mines, hydroelectric power stations and other large-scale, technically complex projects.
    On the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, the Chinese working people have achieved significant achievements in light industry and agriculture.
    Due to the victorious completion of the first Five-Year Plan, the material and cultural living standards of the national working people have improved. The average annual wage of employees in 1957 was almost 43% higher than the level in 1952.
    The Five-Year Plan laid a solid foundation for China's socialist construction to achieve even greater victories in the future. 1958 - the first year of the second Five-Year Plan - was a year of new great leap forward in the history of the country. In this year, the total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 65% compared with 1957, and the output of pig iron and steel reached 24.8 million tons, while it was 11.3 million tons in 1957. The output of grain and cotton has doubled.
    In early April of this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its Seventh Plenary Session, at which it adopted the draft National Economic Plan of the People's Republic of China for 1959. The figures in the plan demonstrate the truly unlimited possibilities for developing the productive forces that the socialist system has opened up for the Chinese people. The main indicators of the draft National Economic Plan adopted by the plenary session are: 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 525 million tons of grain and 5 million tons of cotton. This plan will be submitted to the National People's Congress meeting, which opened in Beijing on April 18, for approval.
    The communique of the State Statistical Bureau said: "In order to further fundamentally change the backwardness of our country's economy and culture, under the guidance of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results in building socialism, the people of the whole country are full of confidence and are striving to realize our country's more ambitious second Five-Year Plan."
    People's China, together with all brotherly socialist countries, will solve the task of winning time in the economic competition with capitalism. It will not take fifteen years to catch up with Britain in the production of the most important industrial products as originally planned, but will catch up with Britain in a much shorter time.
    The Soviet people are heartily delighted with the achievements of the fraternal Chinese people. The May Day slogans of the CPSU Central Committee, which expressed the thoughts and feelings of the Soviet people, said: "Fraternal greetings to the great Chinese people who are building socialism! Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples - a powerful bulwark of world peace!"
    The labor victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party are a valuable contribution to the cause of strengthening the strength of the entire socialist camp. These victories show the great vitality of socialism to the whole world.

　　中国人民的伟大成就
　　苏联“真理报”十七日社论
    中华人民共和国公布了国家统计局关于发展国民经济的第一个五年（1953年到1957年）计划执行结果的公报和关于1958年共和国国民经济发展情况的公报。在这两个公报中援引的数字证明，国民经济各个部门的生产获得了急剧发展，我们中国兄弟作出了光荣和英雄的事业。在共产党总路线鼓舞下的中国劳动人民保证了第一个五年计划的任务提前完成。
    第一个五年计划是在建立强大的社会主义工业化的中国的大道上的一个重要里程碑。中国最近几年来奠定了社会主义工业化的基础，在农业社会主义改造和私营工商业社会主义改造方面取得了决定性的胜利。在1952年和1957年，在国民收入中，国营经济的比重由19％提高到33％，合作社经济的比重由1.5％提高到56％。
    中国共产党结合本国的具体情况创造性地运用社会主义建设的普遍规律，动员了六亿人民大力发展新社会制度的物质基础——重工业。主要的力量和资金都集中地用于这方面。工业投资总数的87％都用于发展重工业。
    中华人民共和国国家统计局的公报指出，在第一个五年期间，中国在苏联的帮助下，进行了一百六十六项重大工业项目的建设。到1957年底，其中有六十八项已经全部建成和部分建成投入生产。忠于无产阶级国际主义原则的苏联人民十分高兴帮助自己的中国兄弟，把自己的丰富经验介绍给他们，以便加速向共同的伟大目标——共产主义迈进。
    中华人民共和国在五年中建成了许多新的工业部门，这些工业部门是半殖民地的旧中国所不能想像的。中国人民已经开始生产国产的飞机、汽车、拖拉机、现代机床和各种设备。
    随着新的工厂、矿山和电站的出现，中国的工人阶级在数量上增加了并且壮大了。人民的科学技术知识分子队伍成长了。1957年，中国的工程技术人员达到十七万五千人，比1952年增长了二倍。现在，中国的工程师和技术人员能够自己设计钢铁联合企业、煤矿、水电站和其他大型的技术复杂的工程。
    中国劳动人民在优先发展重工业的基础上在轻工业和农业方面获得了重大的成就。
    由于胜利地完成了第一个五年计划，全国劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平提高了。职工每年的平均工资1957年几乎比1952年的水平提高了43％。
    五年计划为中国社会主义建设此后获得更大的胜利奠定了可靠的基础。1958年——第二个五年计划的第一年——是国家历史上新的大跃进的一年。在这一年中工农业总产值比1957年增长了65％，生铁和钢的产量达到二千四百八十万吨，而在1957年是一千一百三十万吨。粮食和棉花的产量都增加了一倍。
    今年4月初，中国共产党中央委员会举行了第七次全体会议，会上通过了中华人民共和国1959年的国民经济计划草案。计划的数字证明了社会主义制度为中国人民开辟的发展生产力的真正无限的可能性。全会通过的国民经济计划草案的主要指标是：一千八百万吨钢，三亿八千万吨煤，五亿二千五百万吨粮食和五百万吨棉花，这个计划将交给4月18日在北京开幕的全国人民代表大会会议批准。
    国家统计局的公报中说：“为了进一步地从根本上改变我国的经济和文化的落后面貌，全国人民在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导下，正满怀着信心，为实现我国更宏伟的第二个五年计划而奋勇前进。”
    人民中国同所有兄弟社会主义国家一道要解决在同资本主义的经济竞赛中赢得时间的任务，它在最重要的工业品的生产方面不是像过去拟定那样要十五年才赶上英国，而是将在短得多时间内赶上英国。
    苏联人民对兄弟般的中国人民的成就感到衷心喜悦。在表达了苏联人的思想和感情的苏共中央五一节的口号中说：“向正在建设社会主义的伟大的中国人民致兄弟的敬礼！苏联人民和中国人民牢不可破的友谊和合作——世界和平的强大堡垒万岁！”
    中国人民在光荣的共产党领导下取得的劳动胜利，是对加强整个社会主义阵营的威力的事业的宝贵贡献。这些胜利向全世界表明了社会主义的伟大生命力。
