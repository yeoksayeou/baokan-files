Xinhua News Agency Report: The people of Shandong, Henan, Fujian, Heilongjiang and other provinces angrily condemned the provocative acts of Indian expansionists in supporting the Tibetan rebellion, unreasonably interfering in China's internal affairs, and insulting our leaders.

    The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference convened a symposium on the morning of the 26th with various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages from Shandong Province and Jinan City. Wang Linken, Deputy Director of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "Indian expansionists are like people who forget the pain once the sore has healed. They were ravaged by British imperialism for many years, and they have only recently become independent, yet they are inheriting the mantle of British imperialism, attempting to split Tibet from Chinese territory and realize their expansionist ambitions. This is extremely shameless." Song Wentian, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and others solemnly warned Indian expansionists that they must rein themselves in and stop their venomous clamoring and unreasonable provocations to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine Sino-Indian friendship. Shi Longhai, Director of the Buddhist Association of China, Wang Shenyin, Deputy Director of the Jinan Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and Mi Changmao, Imam of the Great Mosque in Jinan City, cited many facts to refute the slanders made by imperialists and Indian expansionists against our country using religious and ethnic issues.

    In recent days, Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and provincial-level organizations, factories, enterprises, schools, mass organizations, and suburban farmers in Henan Province have held meetings to protest the heinous activities of Indian expansionists in interfering in our internal affairs. Li Wei, Vice Chairman of the Zhengzhou City Federation of Trade Unions, Jiang Haishi, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" strike, and others severely rebuked imperialists and Indian expansionists at the meetings. They solemnly stated that the Chinese working class will never tolerate Indian expansionists interfering in our internal affairs. Qiu Qinglin, a worker and model worker at the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, said: "The Chinese people have stood up. If imperialists and Indian expansionists are obsessed with their ways and unreasonably interfere in our internal affairs, they will definitely be met with utter failure." Sun Shixun, Deputy Director of the Xijiao People's Commune in Zhengzhou City and Provincial Agricultural Labor Model, said: Tibet has been our territory since ancient times, and the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is entirely our internal affair. Any interference by foreign reactionaries is not allowed by the entire Chinese people and peace-loving people of the world.

    Democratic parties and people from all walks of life in Henan Province and Zhengzhou City also held meetings to support the government's thorough suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and condemn imperialism and foreign reactionaries for instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in China's internal affairs.

    Workers and staff of many factories and enterprises in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, took advantage of production breaks to hold discussion meetings. They warned imperialists and Indian expansionists that the era of China being bullied is long gone. The liberated Chinese people have the strength to repel any interferers. If imperialists and Indian expansionists do not stop immediately, they will surely be disgraced and ruined. After returning from transplanting rice seedlings in the fields on the 24th, members of the Hongshan Branch of the People's Commune in the suburbs of Fuzhou City held a discussion meeting at night. The members expressed great indignation at the acts of British imperialism and Indian expansionists in interfering in our internal affairs. They expressed their determination to do a good job in production, support the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly suppressing the Tibetan rebellion, and support the Tibetan compatriots in gaining a new life.

    The heads of the Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese from thirty-three counties and cities in the province, who are currently meeting in Fuzhou, also held a symposium. Speakers at the meeting angrily pointed out: Imperialists and Indian expansionists are vainly attempting to sever Tibet from the map of China, which is absolutely intolerable to the people of our motherland and overseas Chinese. The Chinese people who have stood up will never allow the conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists to succeed. Representatives of Buddhists from all over the province who are in Fuzhou have also held discussions in recent days, angrily condemning imperialists and Indian expansionists for instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our internal affairs. Fu Hui, First Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, said at the meeting that today's China is different from China ten years ago. Interference in China's internal affairs will inevitably lead to shameful failure. Deqin, Second Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Buddhist Association of China and Director of the Buddhist Association of China, Shanlin, Monk of Nanputuo Temple in Xiamen, Fan Hui and Guangai, members of the Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, also severely criticized the shameful acts of foreign interferers in their speeches, warmly hailed the victory of the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the Tibetan rebellion, and congratulated the Tibetan people on embarking on a new life. The local organizations of various democratic parties in Fujian Province also held discussion meetings, and expressed that they would never allow any foreign interferers to meddle in Tibet.

    City people's representatives and CPPCC members of ethnic minorities in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, held a forum to severely condemn the conspiracy of Indian expansionists to split China. CPPCC member Li Zhide (Korean ethnicity) said: "Tibet is Chinese territory, which even imperialism does not dare to deny. The so-called 'Statement of the Dalai Lama' distributed by Indian diplomatic officials vainly attempts to undermine our national unity and ethnic solidarity. We, the Korean ethnic group, along with all fraternal ethnic groups, resolutely protest." Gao Song (Hui ethnicity), Deputy Director of the Municipal Ethnic Affairs Committee, said: "The highest interests of our ethnic minorities are the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups. We will never allow Indian expansionists to openly advocate 'Tibetan independence'."

    Jingguan, Standing Director of the Buddhist Association of China and Abbot of the Jile Temple, said at a meeting of more than 100 Buddhists in Harbin City that he presided over: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, on the one hand, says he respects Sino-Indian friendship, but on the other hand, he expresses sympathy for the Tibetan rebellion. I wonder if he sympathizes with the 1.2 million Tibetan people or the 20,000 rebels.

    In recent days, people in Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang and other places have also held discussion meetings to resolutely oppose the conspiracy activities of Indian expansionists.

    近几天来，河南省郑州市和河南省省级机关、工厂企业、学校、群众团体和郊区农民等，都纷纷集会抗议印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的罪恶活动。郑州市工会联合会副主席李卫、“二七”老工人姜海世等在会上严厉斥责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子。他们严正表示，中国工人阶级决不能容忍印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政。郑州纺织机械厂工人、劳动模范丘清林说：“中国人民已经站起来了，帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子若要执迷不悟，无理干涉我国内政，必将碰得头破血流。郑州市西郊人民公社副社长、省农业劳动模范孙世勋说：西藏自古以来就是我国的领土，平息西藏叛乱完全是我国的内政；外国反动派的任何干涉，都是全中国人民和世界爱好和平的人民所不能容许的。
    河南省、郑州市各民主党派和各界人士也分别集会，拥护政府彻底平息西藏叛乱，谴责帝国主义和外国反动派策动西藏叛乱和干涉中国的内政。
    福建省福州市许多工厂企业职工利用生产间歇时间举行座谈会。他们警告帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子说，中国任人欺侮的时代早已过去了，已经解放了的中国人民有力量回击任何干涉者，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子如果不赶紧罢手，必定要身败名裂。福州市郊人民公社洪山分社的社员24日从田间插秧回来后，夜间举行座谈会，社员们对英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的行为表示了极大的愤慨，他们表示一定要搞好生产，支援解放军彻底平息西藏叛乱，支援西藏同胞获得新生。
    正在福州开会的全省三十三个县、市归国华侨联合会负责人也举行了座谈会。在会上发言的人愤怒地指出：帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子妄想把西藏从中国版图上割裂出去，这是我们祖国各地人民和海外华侨绝对不能容忍的。站起来了的中国人民绝不让帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的阴谋得逞。在福州的全省各地佛教徒代表连日来也纷纷举行座谈，愤怒地谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱和干涉我国内政。中国佛教协会福建省分会筹备委员会第一副主任福慧在会上说，今天的中国不同于十年前的中国，干涉中国内政，必将遭到可耻的失败。中国佛教协会福建省分会筹备委员会第二副主任、中国佛教协会理事德钦、厦门南普陀寺僧值善琳、中国佛教协会福建省分会筹备委员会委员梵辉、广爱等在发言中也严厉斥责外国干涉者的可耻勾当，热烈欢呼解放军讨平西藏叛乱的胜利，祝贺西藏人民走上新生。各民主党派福建省地方组织也分别举行座谈会，纷纷表示决不容许任何外国干涉者染指西藏。
    黑龙江省哈尔滨市少数民族的市人民代表和政协委员举行座谈，严厉谴责印度扩张主义分子妄图分裂中国的阴谋。政协委员李致德（朝鲜族）说：“西藏是中国领土，这连帝国主义也不敢否认，印度外交官员散发的所谓‘达赖喇嘛的声明’竟妄图破坏我们祖国统一和民族团结，我们朝鲜族和各兄弟民族一起坚决抗议。’市民族事务委员会副主任委员高松（回族）说：“我们少数民族的最高利益是祖国的统一和各族人民的团结，我们绝不允许印度扩张主义分子公然鼓吹什么‘西藏独立’”。
    中国佛教协会常务理事、极乐寺方丈静观法师在他主持的哈尔滨市一百多名佛教徒集会上说：印度总理尼赫鲁一方面说尊重中印友谊，另方面却对西藏叛乱事件表示同情，不知他同情一百二十万西藏人民，还是同情两万叛乱分子。
    连日以来，齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、牡丹江等地人民也纷纷举行座谈会，坚决反对印度扩张主义分子的阴谋活动。
