Xinhua News Agency, April 29th. Our correspondent reports: On the afternoon of the 29th, in the spacious lounge of the CPPCC Auditorium, Comrade Zhou Enlai held a tea party to cordially meet with over 300 CPPCC members aged sixty and above from all over the country. It was a unique respect-the-elderly gathering.

The attendees ranged in age from ninety to sixty. Comrades Peng Zhen and Chen Yi were referred to as "alternate elders" because they were both under sixty. Comrade Zhou Enlai humorously remarked that he wouldn't have dared to hold such a tea party last year, but he qualified this year – being exactly sixty years old.

These elders, who had witnessed the changes of several dynasties and possessed rich experiences, though some leaned on crutches and others were assisted into the venue, were all radiant and beaming. The joyous laughter filling the tea party demonstrated the vigorous vitality of the elders living in the new era.

Comrade Zhou Enlai arrived especially early. He stood at the entrance of the venue, welcoming the gray-haired seniors and warmly greeting them with handshakes and conversations.

Amidst warm applause and smiling faces, Comrade Zhou Enlai began to speak. He shared a significant statistic: According to data, among the 1,071 members of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC, 383 were over sixty years old. This included one person at ninety years old, twenty people between eighty and eighty-nine, one hundred and three people between seventy and seventy-nine, and two hundred and fifty-nine people between sixty and sixty-nine. He believed this illustrated the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front in our country. At this point, the hall was filled with laughter and lively atmosphere, with thunderous applause that lasted for a long time.

Comrade Zhou Enlai happily stated that at the first meeting of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC, the older members were full of energy. Though they were advanced in years, their spirit was not old, which was a delightful thing. He hoped that those older members who continued to contribute their energy to the motherland in their respective positions would reasonably arrange their work and rest time. They should both contribute their strength and maintain a cheerful mood. Once again, warm applause echoed through the venue, expressing heartfelt gratitude for such meticulous care.

Regarding those older members who were not currently holding positions, Comrade Zhou Enlai said that they were generally born during the Qing Dynasty and had been citizens of four dynasties. He hoped that they would record the changes and anecdotes they had witnessed over the past seventy or eighty years, as well as the knowledge and experience they had accumulated over the decades, either by writing them down themselves or by dictating them for others to record, so that they could be passed on to our descendants. The entire hall responded with enthusiastic applause in support of Comrade Zhou Enlai's suggestion.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said with a smile that the elders living in the new era were not willing to admit their age and wanted to show their skills in the cause of socialism and communism. At this time, Comrade Kang Sheng said that one-third of the elders present did not have beards, which showed that everyone was not willing to admit being old. This caused a burst of joyous laughter.

During the joyous tea party, the elders enjoyed fruits and pastries while chatting heartily. Huang Yanpei said that he wanted to pass on what he had seen over the past eighty years to future generations, hoping that everyone would work on "passing things on to future generations." Sheng Pihua said that living in the new era and seeing the prosperity and strength of the motherland, especially the great leap forward of 1958, elderly people felt particularly happy and their lives were prolonged. In their warm conversations, the elders from various sectors and with different beliefs expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the care and respect shown to them by the Party and the state, and their desire to dedicate their remaining years to this new era.

Elder Shen Junru showed a big, red apple to others, saying that he would take it home as a memento, and people said it was a "longevity peach," which made him laugh heartily. Elders Li Jishen and Chen Shutong also joined everyone in the joyful gathering and conversation.

This extremely meaningful gathering took place in a joyful atmosphere for over an hour.

    敬老会上尽开怀
    周恩来同志茶会招待三百多位老人
    新华社29日讯　本社记者报道：29日下午，在政协礼堂宽大的休息室里，周恩来同志举行了一个茶话会，同来自祖国各地的三百多位六十岁以上的政协委员亲切会见。这是一次别开生面的敬老会。
    参加这次欢聚的人，最高年龄是九十岁，最小的是六十岁。彭真同志和陈毅同志被人们称为“候补老人”，因为他们都不满六十岁。周恩来同志饶有风趣地说，他在去年还不敢举行这样的茶话会，今年刚够资格——正好六十岁。
    这些曾经历过几个朝代的变迁、有着丰富阅历的老人，他们虽然有的拄着拐杖、有的被人们扶着走进会场，但是，他们个个精神焕发，笑逐颜开。茶话会上一片欢乐的谈笑声，正说明了生活在新时代的老人有着旺盛的生命力。
    周恩来同志来得特别早。他站在会场门口，欢迎那些须发斑白的老者，同他们一一握手欢谈。
    迎着一阵阵热烈的掌声和一张张笑脸，周恩来同志开始谈话。他告诉大家一个有意义的数字：据统计，在政协第三届全国委员会的一千零七十一名委员中，有三百八十三位委员是六十岁以上的。其中九十岁的一人，八十岁到八十九岁的二十人，七十岁到七十九岁的一百零三人，六十岁到六十九岁的二百五十九人。他认为，这是说明我国人民民主统一战线巩固和扩大的一个方面。这时候，笑声满堂，全场活跃，雷动的掌声经久不息。
    周恩来同志非常高兴地说，在政协第三届全国委员会第一次会议上，年高的委员们都生气勃勃，他们虽然年岁老了，但精神不老，这是可喜的事情。他希望那些在工作岗位上继续把自己的精力贡献给祖国的年高的委员们，合理的安排工作和休息的时间。既要贡献自己的力量，又要心情舒畅。这时候，会场上又一次响起了热烈掌声，对这种无微不至的关怀表示衷心地感谢。
    对于那些年高现在没有担任工作的委员，周恩来同志说，他们一般都出生在清朝，作了四个朝代的公民。他希望他们把七、八十年来看到的变化、掌故，把几十年来积累下来的知识和经验，自己写下来或者口述让别人记下来，传给我们的后代。全场又以热烈的掌声拥护周恩来同志的建议。
    周恩来同志笑着说，生活在新时代的老人，都不服老，都想在社会主义和共产主义的事业中多显身手。这时，康生同志说，在座的老人，有三分之一的人不留胡须，这一点就说明大家是不服老的。引起大家欢乐的哄堂大笑。
    在欢乐的茶话会上，老人们一边吃着水果和点心，一边开怀谈心。黄炎培说，他要把八十年来看到的东西交给后人，希望大家都来作“留传后人”的工作。盛丕华说，生活在新的时代里，看到祖国的繁荣富强，特别是看到1958年大跃进的景象，老年人真是心情舒畅，寿命延长。在亲切的交谈中，包括各行各业和各种不同信仰的老人们对党和国家对老人的关怀和尊敬，表示衷心的感激，他们要把自己的余生贡献给这新的时代。
    沈钧儒老人拿着一个又红又大的苹果给别人看，他说要带回家作纪念，人们说这是“寿桃”，他乐得哈哈笑。李济深、陈叔通两位老人也和大家在一起欢聚交谈。
    这个极有意义的聚会，在欢欢乐乐的气氛中进行了一个多小时。
