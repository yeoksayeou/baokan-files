Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, April 26th: According to a broadcast by Thai radio on the evening of the 25th, the Thai Prime Minister's Office actually issued a statement on the Tibetan rebellion in China on the 25th, viciously slandering China for undermining Buddhism and singing anti-communist tunes.

The statement said, "The Thai government has been watching the events in Tibet. In fact, as expected, the more communism expands its power, the more it will endanger peace, especially it will completely destroy Buddhism."

This statement, disregarding the fact that the Chinese government has always respected religious beliefs, clamored out of thin air that "the Tibetan incident just shows the harm of communism to Buddhism."

The statement then clumsily attempted to deceive the Thai people, saying, "Therefore, the Thai people are specifically requested to take the Tibetan incident as an example and always remember that if we cannot prevent the danger of communism, then Buddhism in Thailand will suffer damage like present-day Tibet."

    泰国总理办公室发表声明
    恶毒诬蔑我国破坏佛教
    新华社26日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国电台25日晚上广播，泰国总理办公室25日居然就中国西藏叛乱事件发表一项声明，恶毒诬蔑中国破坏佛教，大唱反共滥调。
    声明说，“泰国政府一直在注视着西藏发生的事件。事实上，就像早所预料的，共产主义愈是扩张他的势力，就会愈加危害到和平，特别是会彻底破坏佛教”。
    这篇声明不顾中国政府一贯遵重宗教信仰的事实，却凭空叫嚣说，“西藏事件正好表明共产主义对佛教的危害”。
    这篇声明接着笨拙地企图蒙骗泰国人民说，“因此，特要求泰国人民以西藏事件为例证，并且经常地记住，如果我们不能防止共产主义的危险，那么，泰国的佛教就会像目前的西藏一样遭受破坏”。
