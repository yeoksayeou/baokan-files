　　Flying Wing to Wing
    A red flag emulation campaign of transplanting rice seedlings, with people chasing and catching up with each other, is being carried out vigorously in the Baqiu Commune of Xiajiang County, Jiangxi Province. Red flags are flying everywhere in the fields, and the competition is surging higher and higher.
      "The Maojia Production Team transplanted nearly 100 mu of rice seedlings in one day!" When this news spread, every team paid close attention. Because the production conditions of this team were not very good, and the labor force was not large. At the beginning of the competition, the cadres of the North Gate Team, their competitors, said dismissively, "Even if the Maojia Team takes off, they won't be able to catch up with us." When the cadres of the Maojia Team heard this, they mobilized everyone to offer suggestions that night. The next morning, the members set out according to their division of labor. Member Mao Songlin transplanted more than four mu of rice seedlings in one day, creating the highest record for transplanting in the whole team. Liu Taiying pulled fifty bundles of seedlings before dawn. The members were all eager to be first, working enthusiastically, and the seedlings were transplanted quickly and well, all meeting the dense planting specifications.
    The captain of the North Gate Team couldn't sleep all night after seeing that the Maojia Team had run ahead in transplanting. He thought: We are stronger than the Maojia Team in terms of labor, and the two teams are about the same in terms of acreage. Why did we lose the competition? Finally, he found the answer: it turned out that he had some complacency and relaxed his leadership. The next day, he convened a meeting of cadres to examine his arrogance and complacency, and everyone came up with some solutions, determined to catch up. They went to the fields with the members early and late every day, discovering problems and solving them at any time. Because the cadres promptly reversed their complacency, took measures, and were good at discovering and solving problems, the members exerted their energy, and caught up with the Maojia Team in three days.
    The North Gate Team caught up, and the Maojia Team was even more energetic. The two teams chased each other and refused to give in, but they cared about each other very much. After the North Gate Team caught up, the speed of transplanting in the Maojia Team jumped forward again. It turned out that they had adopted rice transplanters. The rice transplanters were originally unpopular in the North Gate Team. The members disliked them for leaking seedlings and not transplanting neatly, and were unwilling to use them. Because the Maojia Team did not have enough labor, they focused on the rice transplanters. After more than ten improvements, they could finally transplant eleven mu of rice seedlings a day, which was more than four times faster than manual transplanting. They felt that this was really a good thing. For the sake of common progress, they also sent people to the North Gate Team to teach them and help them use the rice transplanters in order to speed up the transplanting progress.

　　比翼高飞
    你追我赶的插秧红旗竞赛，在江西峡江县巴丘公社轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。田间到处红旗飘扬，竞赛浪潮一个高过一个。
      “毛家生产队一天插秧近百亩！”这消息传开后，各个队都十分注意。因为这个队的生产条件并不怎么好，劳动力也不多。开始竞赛时，他们的竞赛对手——北门队的干部轻视地说：“毛家队就是起飞，也赶不上我们。”毛家队的干部听了，当晚就发动大家献计献策。第二天，一清早社员们就按照分工出动了。社员毛松林一天插秧四亩多，创造了全队插秧最高纪录。刘太英拔了五十把秧天还没亮。社员们个个争先，干得热火朝天，秧插得既快又好，全部符合密植规格。
    北门队的队长，看到毛家队插秧跑到前面去了，彻夜不眠。他想：论劳力我们比毛家队强，论田亩两个队不相上下，为什么比输了呢？最后他终于找出了答案，原来是自己有些自满情绪，放松了领导。第二天便召开干部会议，检查了骄傲自满，大家也想出了一些办法，决心赶上去。他们每天起早摸黑和社员一起下田生产，随时发现问题随时解决。由于干部及时扭转了自满情绪，采取了措施，又善于发现问题解决问题，社员发挥了干劲，三天工夫就追上了毛家队。
    北门队赶上来了，毛家队劲头更旺，两个队你追我赶、互不相让，但互相却很关心。毛家队在北门队追上来以后，插秧的速度又跃进了，原来他们采用了插秧机。插秧机原先在北门队不受欢迎，社员们嫌它漏蔸、插不整齐，都不愿用。毛家队因为劳力不够，就在插秧机身上打主意，经过十多次改进，最后一天可插十一亩秧了，比手插快四倍多。他们觉得这真是个好东西，为了大家共同跃进，又派了人到北门队去传授，帮助他们使用起插秧机，以便加快插秧进度。
