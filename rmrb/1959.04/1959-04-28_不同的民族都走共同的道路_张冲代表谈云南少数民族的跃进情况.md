Presidium, fellow representatives:

    I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 State Final Accounts and the 1959 State Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

    The Tibetan reactionary clique suffered a shameful defeat, another great victory for our country's policy of ethnic unity.

    Just as all ethnic groups in our country are united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and have achieved great success in socialist construction, the armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, has suffered a shameful defeat under the powerful counterattack of the People's Liberation Army, supported by all ethnic groups in the country. This is another great victory for our country's policy of ethnic unity. The development of history is always contrary to the wishes of all reactionaries. The rebellion they launched has led the Tibetan reactionary forces to their own destruction. Indian expansionists have accepted the mantle of British imperialism, attempting to exploit the Tibetan rebellion to realize their ambition of expansion and to split our great motherland. This despicable conspiracy is just a waste of effort and will only end up shooting themselves in the foot. As a representative of a minority nationality, I firmly support the central government's just measures to quell the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionaries, and I firmly oppose Indian expansionists' interference in our internal affairs. We believe that the failure of the Tibetan rebellion will make our country more unified and consolidated, allow the Tibetan people to break free from the shackles of the serf system as soon as possible, and promote the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

    Thanks to the correct implementation of the national policy, many minority nationalities are developing rapidly. Although each nationality has its own characteristics, socialism is the common path for all nationalities to achieve prosperity.

    As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report, thanks to the correct implementation of the national policy, a series of historically significant major changes have taken place in our country's ethnic work. "Many minority nationalities, who were yesterday bound by feudal systems or even slavery, are today embarking on the bright road of socialism. They are truly developing by leaps and bounds." The situation in the minority nationality areas on the Yunnan border is exactly like this.

    At the beginning of liberation, the areas inhabited by the Dai, Hani, Lahu, and Tibetan nationalities, with a population of 1.5 million on the Yunnan border, were basically in feudal lord societies. The 70,000 Yi people in the Liangshan Ninglang area maintained a slave system, and the Ka Wa, Jingpo, Lisu, Bulang, Dulong, and Nu nationalities, with a population of 600,000, still retained the production methods of primitive communes. National oppression and class exploitation had caused the people of all ethnic groups on the border to suffer endless hardships for a long time. But now, the old face of that area has been completely changed. All the ethnic groups on the border, within the unified family of the motherland, have launched a vigorous leap forward on the socialist economic foundation.

    Of course, to enable these minority nationalities, who are at different stages of economic development, to develop and form into new types of socialist nationalities, can only be achieved under the leadership of the Party and with the help of advanced nationalities, relying on the conscious action of the broad masses of working people in their own nationalities. Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, after several years of arduous and meticulous preparatory work, we adopted different methods and policies based on the characteristics of each nationality. In the areas where feudalism and slavery had been formed, we successively completed democratic reforms from 1955 to the beginning of 1958. This was a decisive step in enabling the border nationalities to truly achieve prosperity and progress. After the working people of all nationalities were liberated from the shackles of feudal lords and the slave system, they were able to control their own destiny and demonstrated great enthusiasm for production, thereby promoting the development of the social productive forces of the entire nationality. However, the completion of the democratic reforms, although it abolished the land ownership and other privileges of feudal lords and slave owners, made it difficult for the vast majority of farmers to fundamentally get rid of the backwardness of small-scale production and the poverty in their lives. The people of all ethnic groups were not willing to merely remain satisfied with the victory of the anti-feudal struggle. Under the education of the Party, in the process of production practice, they increasingly raised their class consciousness and their demand to get organized. They saw a more beautiful future for themselves and immediately began the socialist transformation of agriculture. From our practical experience, it can be seen that: although each nationality has its own characteristics, socialism is the common path for all nationalities to achieve prosperity; although the forms of transition can be diverse, the direction of socialism is the common goal of all working people. This is exactly the case. With the development of production, the individual economy has become increasingly unable to meet the needs, and the great superiority demonstrated by cooperative collective production has attracted more and more farmers. Therefore, on the basis of the conscious action of the broad masses, the socialist agricultural collectivization in the border areas was realized in a much shorter time than we had anticipated. By last winter, the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives had accounted for more than 80 percent of the total number of rural households in the area, and with the impetus of the national situation, people's communes were established in areas with a better work foundation, accounting for about half of the population. In this way, the various ethnic groups on the border entered a new historical stage of socialism in terms of social system.

    The fact that Yunnan's border region has experienced such tremendous social changes in such a short period of time naturally reflects an inevitable result of the development of productive forces. The change in production relations has opened up a broad field of activity for the productive forces. Therefore, once the border minority nationalities embarked on the road of socialism, they rapidly promoted the vigorous development of production.

    Rapid production development has changed the face of poverty and backwardness, and the lives of people of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved.

    Although the original levels of development of the various minority nationalities on the Yunnan border were uneven, generally speaking, they were all in a state of very backward production, and the characteristics of "poverty and blankness" were even more prominent. Therefore, the demand of the people of all ethnic groups to develop production and improve their lives was even more urgent. In the Great Leap Forward that began last year, the enthusiasm for production of the people of all ethnic groups burst forth like a surging spring tide. In that year, more than 2 million mu of new paddy fields were opened up in various parts of the border area, a figure exceeding five times the total historical era before the local liberation. With the improvement of agricultural cultivation techniques, grain output in the border area last year increased by about 50 percent compared with 1957, with grain crops in ten counties increasing by nearly two times. In the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in the valleys of Gaoligong Mountain and Biluo Snow Mountain, which people once described as "mountains high, slopes steep, cliffs big, land hanging on the cliffs," after a spring of hard work by the working people last year, they finally opened mountains and carved stones, built more than 2,800 small-scale water conservancy projects, and reclaimed more than one mu of paddy field per person on average. The autumn grain output increased by more than three times compared with the previous year, with an average of 1,600 jin of raw grain per person. In the Ninglang Yi Autonomous County, the slaves, after being liberated, in their first year of organizing last year, reached an average grain output of 1,000 jin per person. In the Honghe, Xishuangbanna, and Dehong regions, due to the collective management of agricultural cooperatives, the superior natural conditions were rationally utilized, resulting in a bumper harvest of grain and various subtropical cash crops. The tea production in Xishuangbanna, the famous "Yunnan Black Tea" producing area, exceeded 15 times that of 1950 last year. With this high-speed development of production, the lives of people of all ethnic groups have also been significantly improved. The facts are so clear: when the border nationalities have a social system suitable for the development of productive forces, the past face of poverty and backwardness will be changed so rapidly.

    Establish a large number of factories and mines to directly serve local agricultural production, and cultivate a contingent of minority workers.

    I cannot fail to mention that, due to the implementation of the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises and combining indigenous and foreign methods, mobilizing the enthusiasm of various autonomous prefectures, more than 3,000 factories and mines of varying sizes have been established in the Yunnan border region in the past year. In the mass movement of steelmaking by the whole people, the people of all ethnic groups on the border have also contributed their own strength, and from this, a contingent of workers from their own nationalities has been formed. These factories and mines are developing underground resources that have been deposited for thousands of years and are directly serving local agricultural production. Only a few years ago, handicrafts in some border nationalities had not yet been separated from agriculture, and even an iron hoe had to be supplied from outside. Now, the iron factories in various autonomous prefectures and counties can not only manufacture various new types of agricultural tools themselves, but also have produced simple machine tools. With the help of the Han nationality, technical workers from minority nationalities have also been born. In the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, the more than 560 factories of different sizes already have more than 10,000 employees. Last year, the total industrial output value of the entire prefecture increased by more than five times compared with 1957. This development of industrial production from scratch marks the progress of the people of all ethnic groups on the border.

    Carry forward the inherent fine traditions of all ethnic groups, abolish outdated customs that are not conducive to production and ethnic unity, and form a new type of inter-ethnic relations of mutual assistance.

    Changes in the economic base will naturally be reflected in people's ideology. While transforming society and nature, the people of all ethnic groups on the border have also undergone major changes in their spiritual outlook. The inherent fine traditions of all ethnic groups have been further developed in collective production, while many outdated customs that are not conducive to production and ethnic unity, as well as the spiritual imprints left over from the era of national oppression, have been changed and abolished by the broad masses themselves. People have canceled the taboos on ghost mountains, ghost lands, ghost waters, and ghost days. The Hani nationality cut down the "Longmenba" used for worshiping gods and ghosts. The Ka Wa nationality set fire to the "human head piles" that caused tribal conflicts. In particular, the mutual support and cooperation among the various ethnic groups in production have broken through the barriers between tribes and ethnic groups, broadened people's minds and horizons, and raised their collectivist consciousness. These revolutionary changes in the ideological field have in turn promoted the leap forward in production. Thousands of Dai women learned to plow the fields for the first time, and every household built toilets. As a Hani folk song says: "No worship of dragon trees, no worship of fields, no belief in the kitchen god, no belief in immortals, cutting down dragon trees turns into carts, knocking down the kitchen god can fertilize the fields!" This is how truly a new ethnic psychological state is expressed. In this common labor and common life, the people of all ethnic groups have gradually formed a new type of inter-ethnic relationship of mutual assistance, consolidating the unity between and within ethnic groups on the basis of socialism.

    The demise of the old system has brought about the rebirth of the entire nationality. Facts have proved that the backward minority nationalities on the border are fully capable of making a leap forward and catching up with the advanced nationalities.

    The leap forward in the minority nationality areas on the Yunnan border is still a starting point, but this rapid change has already excitingly seen the brilliant prospects of all ethnic groups. If, some time ago, some people still doubted whether social reform was in the interests of their own nationality, the facts have now answered. Every person who truly cares about the future of his own nationality should be happy about the prosperous situation that has emerged in his own nationality under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Han nationality, because the reform of the social system has only deprived a few percent of the feudal lords and slave owners in the nationality of their right to exploit, while making more than ninety percent of the working people happy. The demise of the old system has brought about the rebirth of the entire nationality, and those who truly love their own nationality should, of course, love socialism. If, some time ago, some people still doubted whether the backward minority nationalities on the border could also make a leap forward and whether they could develop together with the Han nationality, the facts have now also answered. Although there are difficult aspects in the border areas due to the weakness of the original foundation, there are also advantageous aspects due to its strong potential. In the big family of our motherland, the relatively backward nationalities, which are in the minority, can fully utilize and develop all their favorable conditions with the help of the advanced nationalities. In particular, today, the various ethnic groups on the border have embarked on the road of socialism. Then, as long as they proceed from the actual conditions and fully estimate the positive factors that can be mobilized, along the direction pointed out by the general line of socialist construction, they can fully realize the accelerated leap forward, thereby catching up with the level of the advanced nationalities with the help of the advanced nationalities and achieving the common prosperity of all nationalities. This is precisely the fundamental difference between the ethnic relations under our socialist system and the capitalist system.

    Now, an even more magnificent leap forward plan has been put forward in our country. We believe that as long as we unswervingly adhere to the leadership of the Party, relying on the great strength of the people of all ethnic groups uniting on the basis of socialism within the unified family of the motherland, we will surely be able to overcome difficulties together with the people of the whole country and establish a happy and prosperous socialist society in the ethnic minority areas on the Yunnan border in a not too long period of time.

    不同的民族都走共同的道路
    张冲代表谈云南少数民族的跃进情况主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    西藏反动集团遭到可耻的失败，是我国民族团结政策的又一伟大胜利
    正当我国各族人民巩固地团结在中国共产党的领导之下，在社会主义建设事业中获得了伟大成就的时候，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派所发动的武装叛乱，已在得到全国各族人民支持的、人民解放军的有力反击下，遭到了可耻的失败，这是我国民族团结政策的又一个伟大胜利。历史的发展总和一切反动派的愿望相反，他们所发动的叛乱，使西藏反动势力走上了自取灭亡的道路，印度扩张主义分子接受了英帝国主义的衣钵，企图利用西藏叛乱事件，实现扩张的野心，分裂我们伟大的祖国，这种卑劣的阴谋也只是枉费心机，而且必将搬起石头打自己的脚。作为一个少数民族的代表，我坚决拥护中央对平定西藏反动派叛乱的严正措施，并且坚决反对印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政。我们相信，由于西藏叛乱的失败，一定会使得我们的国家更加统一和巩固，使西藏人民早日打破农奴制度的枷锁，促进西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
    由于民族政策的正确执行，许多少数民族正一日千里地向前发展。各民族虽有不同特点，但社会主义却是各民族走向繁荣的共同道路
    正如周恩来总理的报告中所指出了的，由于民族政策的正确执行，我国民族工作方面已经发生了一系列具有历史意义的重大变化。“许多少数民族昨天还受着封建制度甚至奴隶制度的束缚，今天已经走上了社会主义的光明大道。他们真正是在一日千里地向前发展”。云南边疆少数民族地区的情况，也正是这样。
    解放之初，云南边疆一百五十万人口的傣族、哈尼族、拉祜族和藏族的聚居地区，基本上处于封建领主社会，凉山宁蒗地区的七万彝族，保持着奴隶制度，还有六十万人口地区的佧佤、景颇、傈僳、布朗、独龙和怒族等，则还残存着原始公社的生产方式。民族压迫和阶级剥削，曾使边疆各族人民长时期内遭受着无边的苦难，而现在那里却已经完全地改变了旧日的面貌，祖国统一大家庭内的边疆各个民族，已在社会主义的经济基础上，展开了蓬蓬勃勃的跃进局面。
    当然，要使这样一些处于不同经济发展阶段的少数民族，发展和形成为新型的社会主义民族，是只有在党的领导和先进民族的帮助之下，依靠本民族中广大劳动群众的自觉行动，才能实现的。我们在中央的正确领导之下，经过了几年艰巨而细致的准备工作以后，根据各民族的特点，采取不同的方法和政策，在已形成封建制和奴隶制的地区，于一九五五年至一九五八年初先后完成的民主改革，这是使边疆民族真正地得到繁荣进步的一个决定性的步骤。各族劳动人民在封建领主和奴隶制度的桎梏中获得解放以后，才掌握了自己的命运，并表现出极大的生产积极性来，从而推动了整个民族的社会生产力的向前发展。但是，民主改革的完成，虽然废除了封建领主和奴隶主的土地所有制与其它特权，然而广大农民还难以从根本上摆脱小生产的落后性和生活上的贫困状态；而各族人民也并不愿意仅仅停留于反封建斗争的胜利，他们在党的教育下，在生产实践的过程中，日益提高了阶级觉悟和组织起来的要求，看到了自己更为美好的未来，紧接着就开始了农业的社会主义改造。从我们的实践经验中可以看出：尽管各民族具有着它不同的特点，但是社会主义却是各民族走向繁荣的共同道路；尽管过渡的形式是可以多种多样的，但是社会主义的方向，却是各族劳动人民一致向往的目标。事实正是如此，随着生产的发展，个体经济已愈来愈显得不能适应需要，而合作社集体生产所表现出来的巨大优越性，吸引了愈来愈多的农民群众。因此，在广大群众自觉的基础上，边疆实现社会主义农业合作化的时间，比我们所预料的要短得多，到去年冬季，入社农户已占当地农村总户数的百分之八十以上，并且在全国形势的推动之下，在工作基础较好的、约占二分之一人口的地区，成立了人民公社。这样，就使得边疆各民族在社会制度上进入了一个社会主义的新的历史阶段。
    云南边疆在一个短暂的时间内就经历了这么巨大的社会变革，自然是反映了生产力发展的一种必然结果。而生产关系的改变，又为生产力开辟了广阔的活动场所，所以，一当边疆少数民族走上了社会主义的大道以后，就迅速促进了生产的猛烈发展。
    生产迅速发展，改变了贫困落后面貌，各族人民生活有显著改善
    云南边疆的各个少数民族，虽然原有的发展水平是不平衡的，但是总的说来，都处于生产十分落后的状况，“一穷二白”的特点更为显著，因此，各族人民发展生产改善生活的要求也就更加迫切。在去年开始的大跃进中，各族人民的生产积极性，真像春潮澎湃一般地迸发了出来。在这一年里，边疆各地新开的水田达到二百多万亩，这个数字超过了当地解放以前全部历史时代的五倍；随着农业耕作技术的改进，边疆粮食产量去年比一九五七年增长了百分之五十左右，其中十个县的粮食作物增产将近两倍。在高黎贡山和碧罗雪山峡谷的怒江傈僳族自治州，是人们曾把它称做“山高坡陡崖子大，土地挂在悬壁上”的地方，但是经过劳动人民去年一个春天的奋战，终于开山凿石，兴修了二千八百多件小型水利工程，平均每人开垦了一亩以上的水田，秋后的粮食产量比前年增加了三倍以上，按人口平均每人已有一千六百斤原粮；宁蒗彝族自治县的奴隶们，获得了解放以后，在去年组织起来的第一年里，粮食产量就达到了每人平均一千斤的水平；在红河，西双版纳和德宏地区，由于农业社的集体经营，优厚的自然条件得到了合理的利用，使当地的粮食和各种亚热带经济作物都获得了丰收，著名的“滇红”产区西双版纳的茶叶，去年的产量超过一九五零年的十五倍。随着生产的这种高速度发展，各族人民的生活也有了显著的改善。事实是这样明显，当边疆民族有了一个适合于生产力发展需要的社会制度以后，以往贫困落后的面貌，就将何等迅速的改变。
    兴办大批厂矿，直接服务于当地农业生产，并培养了少数民族工人阶级的队伍
    我不能不说到：由于执行了大中小型企业同时并举和土洋结合的方针，调动了各个自治州地方的积极性，云南边疆在过去的一年内，已经兴办起规模不等的三千多个厂矿，在全民炼钢的群众运动中，边疆各族人民也贡献了一份自己的力量，并且从中形成了本民族工人阶级的队伍。这些厂矿开发着蕴藏了千年万代的地下资源，并且直接地服务于当地的农业生产。还只是几年以前，边疆若干民族中的手工业还没有从农业中分离出来，甚至连一把铁制的锄头都要靠外地供应，而现在各自治州、各县的铁工厂，不但能够自己制造多种的新式农具，而且已经生产出简易机床；在汉族的帮助下，少数民族中的技术工人也已经诞生。在德宏傣族景颇族自治州内，五百六十多个大小不同的工厂中，已经拥有职工一万多人，去年全州的工业总产值，比一九五七年增长了五倍还多。工业生产上这种从无到有的发展，正标志着边疆各族人民前进的步伐。
    发扬了各民族固有的优良传统，废除了不利于生产和民族团结的陈规陋习，形成了互相帮助的新型的民族关系
    经济基础的改变，当然会反映到人们的意识形态上来。边疆各族人民在改造社会与自然界的同时，也使自己的精神面貌发生了重大的变化。各民族固有的优良传统，在集体生产中得到了进一步的发扬，而许多不利于生产和民族团结的陈规旧习，以及在民族压迫的年代里所留下在精神上的烙印，却由广大群众自己起来改变和废除了。人们取消了对鬼山、鬼地、鬼水、鬼日的禁忌，哈尼族砍倒了祭神敬鬼的“龙门巴”，佧佤族放火烧掉了引起部落械斗的“人头桩”，特别是各族群众在生产中的相互支援，相互协作，冲破了部落、民族之间的壁垒，开阔了人们的胸襟眼界，提高了集体主义觉悟。这一切在思想领域上的革命性的变化，又反过来推动了生产的跃进，成千上万的傣族妇女第一次学会了犁田，家家户户修起了厕所；正像哈尼族中流传的一首民歌所说：“不祭龙树不祭田，不信灶君不信仙，砍倒龙树车子化，推倒灶君能肥田！” 这是多么真实地表现了一种新的民族心理状态。各族人民在这种共同劳动共同生活中，也就逐渐形成了互相帮助的新型的民族关系，在社会主义的基础上，巩固了民族之间和民族内部的团结。
    旧制度的灭亡，换来整个民族的新生，事实证明，边疆落后的少数民族完全能够跃进，赶上先进民族
    云南边疆少数民族地区的跃进，现在还是一个起点，但是这种一日千里的变化，已是多么令人兴奋地看到了各民族辉煌的远景。如果说，在前些时候，还有人怀疑社会改革是否符合本民族的利益，那么，现在事实已经作了回答。每一个真正关心于本民族前途的人，他对于自己的民族在党的领导和汉族的帮助下所出现的兴旺的局面，只应当为此而感到高兴，因为社会制度的改革，只是使本民族中百分之几的封建主和奴隶主失去了剥削的权利，而使百分之九十几以上的劳动人民获得了幸福，旧制度的灭亡，换来了整个民族的新生，真正热爱自己民族的人，他当然也就应该热爱社会主义。如果说，在前些时候，还有人怀疑边疆落后的少数民族，是否也能够跃进，是否能够和汉族共同发展，那么，现在事实也已经作了答复。边疆地区虽然由于原来基础的薄弱而存在着困难的方面，但是又由于它潜力的雄厚而具有着有利的方面，在我们祖国的大家庭里，处于少数地位的，比较落后的民族，由于有了先进民族的帮助，他们的一切有利条件就可以得到充分的运用和发挥，特别是，今天边疆的各民族已经走上了社会主义的道路，那么，只要沿着社会主义建设总路线所指引的方向，从现实的条件出发，又充分地估计到可以调动起来的各个方面的积极因素，就完全可以实现加速度的跃进，从而在先进民族的帮助下，赶上先进民族的水平，达到各民族的共同繁荣。这正是我们社会主义制度下的民族关系，和资本主义制度的根本区别所在。
    现在，我国一个更为宏伟的跃进计划，已经提出来了。我们相信，只要始终不渝地坚持党的领导，在祖国统一的大家庭内，依靠各族人民在社会主义基础上团结起来的巨大力量，我们就一定可以和全国人民一道，克服困难，在不太长久的时间内，在云南边疆民族地区，建立起幸福繁荣的社会主义社会。
