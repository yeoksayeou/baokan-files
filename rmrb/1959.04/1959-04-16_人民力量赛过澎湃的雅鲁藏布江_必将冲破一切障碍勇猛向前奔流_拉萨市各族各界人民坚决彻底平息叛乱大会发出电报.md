Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 15th—The telegram from the Lhasa People of All Ethnic Groups and Circles Resolutely and Thoroughly Quelling the Rebellion Meeting to the compatriots of all ethnic groups and circles in the Tibet region is as follows in full:
	Today, we, the people of all ethnic groups and circles in Lhasa, solemnly held a mass rally of ten thousand people to resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion, resolutely support the State Council’s order on thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion and dissolving the Tibetan local government that betrayed the motherland and undermined the unification of the motherland, and will actively assist the People’s Liberation Army in resolutely and thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion.
	The former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique have been engaged in treasonous activities for a long time, attempting to plunge the Tibetan people back into the abyss of imperialist enslavement. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central Government has always waited for the awakening of these reactionaries in the spirit of national unity, and the broad masses of working people have also endured many unspeakable sufferings under the cruel rule of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique. However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique regarded this lenient attitude of the Central Government as weak and could be deceived, and even more unscrupulously colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland, tear up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and openly launched an armed rebellion, forcing the Tibetan people to a point of unbearable endurance.
	Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the People's Liberation Army and personnel stationed in Tibet have faithfully implemented the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government's policy of equality and unity among nationalities, consistently respected the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people, helped the Tibetan region develop various construction undertakings, issued interest-free agricultural and animal husbandry loans to us, established hospitals and schools, built roads and river embankments, and always considered the interests of the Tibetan people in every way. All these facts are obvious and visible to all. The broad masses of monks and lay people deeply feel the warmth of the motherland's big family and wholeheartedly love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
	Now, the extremely reactionary Tibetan local government, which openly engaged in treasonous activities, has been dissolved, the treasonous and criminal activities of the upper-class reactionary clique have been crushed, and the enslaved and oppressed Tibetan people have stood up. We must thoroughly expose and accuse the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique of colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland and launch an armed rebellion, an act of monstrous crime. We resolutely demand the thorough suppression of the rebellion in Tibet.
	We are determined, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to wholeheartedly respond to all the calls of the Lhasa Military Control Committee of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, safeguard the unification of the motherland and defend the unity of all nationalities, and together with the People's Liberation Army, resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion, eliminate all open and hidden rebels, so that the broad masses of monks and lay people in Tibet can live a peaceful and happy life. We are determined, under the leadership of the Military Control Committee, to do a good job in this year's production, seize the farming season, sow seeds in a timely manner, and not leave an acre of land uncultivated.
	Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tibetan people have become more closely united. Let our strength be like the surging Yarlung Tsangpo River, washing away all the rebels who hinder the progress of Tibetan society! Let Tibet advance along the glorious, democratic, and socialist road!

　　人民力量赛过澎湃的雅鲁藏布江
　　必将冲破一切障碍勇猛向前奔流
　　拉萨市各族各界人民坚决彻底平息叛乱大会发出电报
    新华社拉萨15日电　拉萨市各族各界人民坚决彻底平息叛乱大会给西藏地区各族各界同胞的电报，全文如下：
    今天，我们拉萨市的各族各界人民庄严地举行了一个坚决、彻底平息叛乱的万人群众大会，坚决拥护国务院关于彻底平息西藏叛乱，解散背叛祖国、破坏祖国统一的西藏地方政府的命令，并且要积极协助人民解放军坚决彻底平息西藏叛乱。
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，长期进行叛国活动，妄图使西藏人民重新陷于帝国主义奴役的深渊。西藏和平解放以后，中央一直本着民族团结的精神，等待这些反动分子的觉悟，广大劳动人民在原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的残酷统治下，也忍受了许多难言的痛苦。但原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团把中央这种宽大的态度认为是软弱可欺，更加变本加厉地勾结帝国主义和国外反动派，背叛祖国、撕毁和平解放西藏办法的协议，公然发动武装叛乱，迫使西藏人民到了忍无可忍的地步。
    西藏和平解放以来，进藏人民解放军和工作人员，忠实地执行了中国共产党和中央人民政府民族平等团结的政策，一贯地尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，帮助西藏地区发展各项建设事业，给我们发放无息农牧贷款，兴办医院、学校，修筑公路河堤，处处为西藏人民的利益着想，凡此种种，事实昭著，有目共睹。广大僧俗人民都深深感到祖国大家庭的温暖，衷心热爱共产党和毛主席。
    现在，反动透顶的公开进行叛国活动的西藏地方政府已被解散，上层反动集团的叛国罪恶活动已遭到粉碎，被奴役被压迫的西藏人民已经站起来了。我们要彻底揭发和控诉西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋匪帮和外国反动派背叛祖国、发动武装叛乱的滔天罪行，我们坚决要求彻底平息西藏的叛乱。
    我们决心在中国共产党的领导下，衷心响应人民解放军西藏军区拉萨市军事管制委员会的一切号召，维护祖国的统一和保卫各民族的团结，和人民解放军一起，坚决彻底平息叛乱，肃清一切公开的和隐藏的叛乱分子，使西藏广大僧俗人民过和平幸福的生活。我们决心在军管会的领导下，搞好今年的生产，抓紧农时，及时下种，不荒掉一亩土地。
    在中国共产党的英明领导下，西藏人民已经更加紧密地团结起来了。让我们的力量像汹涌澎湃的雅鲁藏布江一样，把一切阻碍西藏社会前进的叛乱分子，冲洗得干干净净！让西藏沿着光辉灿烂的、民主的和社会主义的道路前进！
