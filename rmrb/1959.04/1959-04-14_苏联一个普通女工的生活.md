　　The Life of an Ordinary Female Worker in the Soviet Union

　　Olga Dmitrievna Belova is a woman of short stature, with big eyes and a broad face, and industrious hands. She is a female worker at the textile factory named after Mikhail Frunze. Since her husband passed away in 1945, Olga Dmitrievna has single-handedly shouldered the burden of housework, raising two daughters to adulthood.

　　Olga Dmitrievna enjoys high prestige among the female workers in the factory. They elected her as a member of the factory committee of the textile union and also entrusted her with the responsibility of the factory's nursery and kindergarten.

　　Belova's life is rich and colorful. She enjoys recreational activities and loves to read meaningful books. Like millions of Soviet women, she lives and works happily and joyfully.

　　Visiting the factory kindergarten to inspect the work, Belova always loves to be with the children. She once said: "Children are our future. Therefore, we should work and live for them."
　　The person who often likes to come to the reading room of the factory library to borrow books is none other than the beloved Olga Dmitrievna Belova (right).
　　Although Belova is very busy with work, she also does a good job of managing household chores. This is her going to the cooking store to buy delicious meals to prepare dinner for the whole family.
　　This is Belova's whole family. They are sharing refreshments on a day off.

　　苏联一个普通女工的生活
    奥丽加·德米特利叶芙娜·别洛娃是一个个子不高、大眼睛、宽脸庞的妇女，她有一双勤劳的手。她是以米哈依尔·伏龙芝命名的纺织工厂的女工。自1945年丈夫去世后，奥丽加·德米特利叶芙娜就独身担起家务的重担，亲手扶养两个女儿长大成人。
    奥丽加·德米特利叶芙娜在工厂女工中间享有很高的威信。她们选她为纺织工会工厂委员会的委员，而且还委托她负责工厂托儿所和幼儿园的工作。
    别洛娃的生活是丰富多采的，她既喜爱娱乐活动，又爱读有意义的书籍。她和苏联千百万妇女一样幸福而愉快地生活和工作着。
