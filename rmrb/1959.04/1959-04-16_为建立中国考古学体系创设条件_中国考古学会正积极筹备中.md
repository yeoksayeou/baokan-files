　　Creating Conditions for Establishing a Chinese Archaeological System
    The Archaeological Society of China is Actively Preparing

　　Since liberation, with the concern of the Party and the government, archaeology has greatly developed, fundamentally changing the backwardness before liberation.

　　Archaeology is an organic component of history and one of the tools for the Party's theoretical struggle. In recent years, due to the very heavy archaeological workload, subjective forces have been insufficient to meet objective needs. A large amount of data cannot be sorted and studied in time. At the same time, the lack of an established Chinese archaeological system has also affected the unfolding and deepening of scientific research. Therefore, how to establish a Marxist Chinese archaeological system has become a common concern for cultural relic and archaeological workers across the country. Of course, establishing a scientific and complete Chinese archaeological system cannot be accomplished by a few experts or individual units in a short period of time. This requires the joint efforts of cultural relic and archaeological workers across the country over a considerable period of time.

　　In order to actively promote this work, this issue was also emphasized and discussed at the symposium on compiling "Ten Years of Archaeology," jointly convened by the Institute of Archaeology and the State Bureau of Cultural Relics in January this year. Cultural relic and archaeological workers from thirteen provinces and cities, as well as comrades from the Nanjing Museum, the Beijing Museum of History, Peking University, Northwest University, the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, and other units, participated in the meeting. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the Archaeological Society of China should be established first, so that through this mass academic organization, the cultural relic and archaeological workers across the country can be further united to promote academic research in archaeology and create conditions for the establishment of a Marxist Chinese archaeological system.

　　Based on the proposal of the symposium, the units participating in the meeting will serve as the initiating units for organizing the Archaeological Society of China, and the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, the Department of History of Peking University, and the Institute of Archaeology are designated as liaison units to be responsible for the preparatory work. At present, they are actively preparing to convene a national archaeological work conference in order to formally establish the Archaeological Society of China.

　　为建立中国考古学体系创设条件
    中国考古学会正积极筹备中
    解放以来，在党和政府的关怀下，考古事业有了很大的发展，根本改变了解放以前的落后面貌。
    考古学是历史学的有机构成部分，是党的理论斗争的工具之一。几年来，由于考古工作任务十分繁重，主观的力量不敷客观的需要，大量资料来不及整理研究，同时，由于还没有建立起我国考古学系统，也影响到科学研究的展开和深入。因此，如何建立马克思主义的中国考古学体系，便成为目前全国文物考古工作者共同关心的问题。当然，要建立一个科学的完整的中国考古学系统，绝不是靠少数专家或个别单位在短时间内所能办到的，这需要全国文物考古工作者花相当时间的共同努力才能完成。
    为了积极推动这个工作，在今年1月间，由考古研究所和文化部文物局联合召开的编写“十年考古”的座谈会上，也着重讨论了这个问题。参加这次座谈会的有来自十三个省、市的文物考古工作者，和南京博物院、北京历史博物馆、北京大学、西北大学、古脊椎动物研究所等单位的有关同志。在会上，大家一致认为首先应该把中国考古学会成立起来，以便通过这个群众性的学术组织，进一步团结全国文物考古工作者，推动考古学中的学术研究工作，为马克思主义的中国考古学体系的建成创造条件。
    根据座谈会倡议，由参加会议的各单位，作为组织中国考古学会的发起单位，并指定文化部文物局、北京大学历史系和考古研究所作为联络单位，负责进行准备工作。目前他们正积极筹备召开全国性的考古工作会议，以便正式成立中国考古学会。
