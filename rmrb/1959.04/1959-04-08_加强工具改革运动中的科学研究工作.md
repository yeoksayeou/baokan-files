Strengthen Scientific Research in the Tool Reform Movement

With the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, a new high tide of technological revolution centered on tool reform emerged in the vast rural areas of our country in 1958. This mass movement of technological innovation, as soon as it appeared, exerted tremendous power, propelling the entire agricultural production forward at an unprecedented speed. Now, the common task facing all farmers, the vast number of rural work cadres, and all agricultural science and technology researchers is how to elevate the tool reform movement a step further, so that it can exert greater power in striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production and in the great struggle to achieve agricultural mechanization and electrification in our country faster and better.

Achieving a greater leap forward in agriculture this year and realizing the mechanization of agriculture in our country at an early date, one is the current combat task, and the other is the long-term goal of struggle. The two glorious tasks are closely related: Successfully completing the various leap forward targets of agricultural production this year can provide a stronger material foundation for the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification. And vigorously engaging in tool reform is not only an important guarantee for improving labor productivity, solving the contradiction of labor shortage, further improving the quality of cultivation, comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for increasing agricultural production, and successfully realizing the great leap forward in agricultural production this year; it is also carrying out practical technical preparations for agricultural mechanization and electrification. Because to strive for the task of realizing mechanization and electrification faster, it requires not only the further development of industry, but also agricultural machines suitable for our country's needs. Only with such machines can we mass-produce, promote, and use them, and realize mechanization and electrification. Where do such agricultural machines come from? We can import some from foreign countries, and we can learn from advanced countries, especially from the Soviet Union; but the most important source is still the inventions and creations in our own production practice, and it still relies on the mass tool reform movement directly participated in by the broad masses of laborers.

Vigorously engage in the tool reform movement, and not just ordinary tool reform, but a more effective tool reform that can create more and better tools and agricultural machines. These new-style tools and agricultural machines should have the characteristics of high efficiency, simple structure, convenient operation, and low cost. Only tools with such performance can be promoted and used more quickly, can increase agricultural labor productivity in our country more quickly and greatly, can fundamentally solve the difficulty of labor shortage, and thus powerfully help us successfully realize the great and glorious task of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year; only tools and agricultural machines with this performance can create conditions and provide a solid technical foundation for the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification in our country. How can we achieve this? The fundamental method is to continue to vigorously engage in mass movements, and on the basis of vigorously engaging in mass movements, strengthen scientific research work, concentrate the creations of the broad masses, and analyze, study, and improve them. Without the enthusiastic participation of the broad masses, the tool reform movement cannot achieve great results, which has been proven by countless historical facts, especially the experience of 1958. Similarly, without timely concentrating the experience of the masses, the wisdom of the masses, and the inventions and creations of the masses, and without timely strengthening scientific research work, the tool reform movement cannot achieve great results, which has also been proven by countless historical facts, especially the experience of 1958.

In recent years, my country's agricultural machinery scientific research work has achieved great accomplishments. In particular, in the tool reform movement of 1958, a mass upsurge of agricultural machinery scientific research emerged. In the vigorous mass tool reform movement, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and technicians devoted themselves to the invention and creation of new agricultural implements, and many "Sai Zhuges" (referring to very wise individuals), "Living Lubans" (referring to master craftsmen), and "local experts" appeared in various places. In this year, the various tools created across the country accumulated to tens of thousands of pieces. It was truly a blossoming of hundreds of flowers, a sight to behold. Now, after more than a year of effort, many tools with high work efficiency and good quality, such as various native tools fitted with ball bearings, such as rope-traction machines, rice transplanters, and fast rice harvesters, have been promoted in various places according to local conditions. Due to the promotion and use of these tools, a large amount of labor has been saved, which played an important role in promoting the great agricultural harvest of 1958. In particular, the emergence of rope-traction machines not only provided an effective power source for deep plowing at that time; it may also be a shortcut to the mechanization and electrification of agriculture in our country. Currently, many regions are actively experimenting with this tool and are further researching to enable it to carry out comprehensive operations. In addition, further progress has been made in the research of internal combustion water pumps, which have a wide range of uses; a simple rice transplanter has been created, and because it is easy to manufacture and the materials are readily available, it has been promoted throughout the country; another more precise rice transplanter has also been successfully tested and will be put into production with the development of the national industry. Recently, a variety of deep plowing tools have appeared, including animal-powered deep plowing plows, winch-operated deep plowing plows, power rope-traction plows, and tractor-drawn deep plowing plows. All these research results show the thriving atmosphere of agricultural machinery scientific research in our country. Does this mean that the achievements of agricultural machinery scientific research in our country and its speed of development can already meet the needs of current and future economic development? We cannot say that yet. Although our research achievements are great and the progress is fast, they are still very incompatible with the requirements of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture this year and the future development of mechanization in our country. Agricultural production is developing so rapidly that if we do not strengthen agricultural science and agricultural machinery research work, and do not provide more and better and faster those high-efficiency, good-quality, and low-cost new machines, it will inevitably affect the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. For example, the movement for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu of wheat has now been launched across the country. There is no doubt that a large number of thousand-jin high-yield fields will appear across the country. This requires a high-efficiency wheat harvester, but we are still in the process of creating and researching this tool, and it has not yet been finally successful. For another example, in the autumn of last year, a large-scale bumper harvest of tubers appeared in many areas of our country, with yields of tens of thousands of jin per mu. There is a great need for a high-efficiency, good-quality tuber digging machine to meet the needs of tuber harvesting, but we still do not have a suitable harvester to this day. For another example, my country achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton in 1958. Cotton picking requires a lot of labor, and a cotton harvester is also needed to solve the problem of labor shortage, but we do not currently have such a harvester. Moreover, because our country is vast and the natural conditions are complex, in terms of terrain, there are plains, mountains, plateaus, hills, and swamps; in terms of land use, there are paddy fields, dry fields, slopes, and terraces; in terms of farming techniques, there are flat cultivation, ridge cultivation, bed cultivation, and intercropping. There are many kinds of crops, and different regions have different cultivation methods. This stipulates the diversity and complexity of agricultural machinery models in our country. In particular, the "Eight-Character Constitution" summarized in the Great Leap Forward in agriculture last year has even higher requirements for agricultural machinery. All this shows that our current agricultural machinery scientific research work is not ahead of the needs of production, but cannot keep up with the needs of the high-speed development of agricultural production in our country.

However, we are fully confident in doing a good job in agricultural machinery research work. Under the leadership and training of the Party, we already have an increasingly strong team of agricultural machinery researchers, and we have already found a scientific research method that closely connects with reality and closely connects with the masses. Agricultural machinery researchers should continue to go deep into reality and deep into the masses, humbly learn from the masses, and work with the masses to study the various tools invented and created by the broad masses in the Great Leap Forward, and we will surely get good results. All agricultural machinery research departments should widely carry out experience exchanges and carry out technical collaboration to make the results of scientific research more fruitful. We have rich experience in this regard: the Red Flag rice transplanter being promoted in Jiangxi was created on the basis of absorbing the advantages of the rice transplanter and transplanting boat created by the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute. Li Zhaosen, a comrade from Jiangsu, created a wind-powered rope-traction machine, and the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute created an electric rope-traction machine on the basis of summarizing this experience and referring to the Fujian electric plow. The method of exchanging strengths and making up for weaknesses in technical exchanges is a method that is more, faster, better, and more economical, and this method can only be done in a socialist country, because we understand that the purpose of inventions and creations is for the collective and to accelerate socialist construction. Therefore, we should appropriately hold some agricultural machinery experience exchange meetings, evaluation meetings, or adopt the method of delivering technology to the door to widely exchange experience.

While carrying out agricultural machinery scientific research, we must also gradually carry out the appraisal work of agricultural machinery. Before each agricultural implement is widely promoted, we must strive to undergo large-scale trials and carry out practical appraisals to assess the adaptability, economy, and reliability of the agricultural implements. For machines that have been proven to meet agricultural requirements, are sturdy and reliable, and are economically worthwhile through field trials, they will be put into production and mass-manufactured. Agricultural machines imported from foreign countries or other places must also be tested to prove that they meet local requirements before they can be widely promoted. Facts have proven that failure to undergo appraisal or failure to conduct serious appraisal can easily cause losses in promotion. Agricultural machinery science work must comprehensively implement the general line, not only to be more and faster, but also to be better and more economical; it opposes both the shrinking and backward style of work and the practice of blindly promoting without appraisal.

At present, a larger-scale, wider-ranging, deeper, and more practical tool reform movement is being carried out throughout the country. Agricultural machinery scientific research institutions in various places must, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, closely combine with the mass tool reform movement, carry out agricultural machinery scientific research work in a planned and step-by-step manner, promote a greater leap forward in agriculture in 1959; and make technical preparations for future agricultural mechanization and electrification.

    加强工具改革运动中的科学研究工作
    随着农业生产大跃进，1958年我国广大农村出现了一个技术革命的新高潮。这个群众性的以工具改革为中心的技术革新运动，一出现就发挥了巨大的威力，推动着整个农业生产以空前未有的速度向前飞跃发展起来。现在，摆在全体农民、广大农村工作干部和所有农业科学技术研究人员面前的共同任务，是如何把工具改革运动提高一步，使它在争取更大更好更全面的农业生产大跃进中、在更快更好地实现我国农业机械化电气化的伟大斗争中发挥更大的威力。
  实现今年农业更大跃进和早日实现我国农业机械化，一个是目前的战斗任务，一个是长远的奋斗目标，两个光荣的任务有着十分密切的关系：胜利完成今年农业生产的各项跃进指标，可以给实现农业机械化电气化提供更雄厚的物质基础。而大搞工具改革，不仅是提高劳动生产率，解决劳动力不足的矛盾，进一步提高耕作质量，全面地贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”，胜利实现今年农业生产更大跃进的重要保证；也是为农业机械化电气化进行着切实的技术准备。因为要争取更快地实现机械化电气化的任务，不仅需要工业的进一步发展，也需要有适合我国需要的农业机器，有了这种机器，我们才能大量制造、推广和使用，才能够实现机械化电气化。这样的农业机器从哪里来呢？可以从外国进口一些，可以向先进的国家特别是向苏联学习；但是最主要的来源还是我们自己生产实践中的发明创造，还是靠广大劳动者直接参加的广大群众性的工具改革运动。
    大搞工具改革运动，并且不是普通的工具改革，而是一个更有成效、能够创造出更多更好的工具和农业机器的工具改革运动，这种新式工具和农业机器，要具备效率高、构造简单、操作方便、成本低廉等等特点。具有这种性能的工具和农业机器，才能更快地推广使用，才能更快更大地提高我国的农业劳动生产率，才能从根本上解决劳力不足的困难，从而有力地帮助我们胜利实现今年农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进的伟大光荣的任务；只有这种性能的工具和农业机器，才能够为我国实现农业机械化电气化创造条件，提供坚实的技术基础。怎样才能做到这一点呢？根本的办法，就是继续大搞群众运动，并在大搞群众运动的基础上，加强科学研究工作，把广大群众的创造集中起来，加以分析、研究、提高。没有广大群众的热烈参加，工具改革运动不可能获得巨大的成果，这已经被无数的历史事实、特别是1958年经验所证明了。同样，不及时地把群众的经验、群众的智慧、群众的发明创造集中起来，加以研究提高，不及时地加强科学研究工作，工具改革运动也不可能获得巨大成果，这也已经被无数的历史事实，特别是1958年的经验证明了的。
    几年来，我国农业机械科学研究工作取得了很大的成就，特别在1958年工具改革运动中，更出现了一个群众性的农业机械科学研究高潮。在轰轰烈烈的群众性的工具改革运动中，广大工人、农民和技术人员纷纷投入了对新式农具的发明创造，各地都出现了不少“赛诸葛”“活鲁班”和“土专家”。这一年全国创造的各种工具累积起来达数万件，真是百花齐放，美不胜收。现在，经过一年多的努力，许多工效高、质量好的工具中如装上滚珠轴承的各种土工具，如绳索牵引机、水稻插秧机和快速割禾器等，已经因地制宜地在各地推广着。由于这些工具的推广和使用，节省了大量的劳动力，对1958年农业大丰收起了重要的推动作用。特别是绳索牵引机的出现，不仅给当时深耕找出有效的动力；同时也可能是我国农业机械化电气化的一条捷径。现在不少地区都在积极地试验这种工具，并进一步研究使它能够进行综合作业。此外，如用途很广的内燃水泵的研究已经有了进一步的成果；一种简易的水稻插秧机已经创造了出来，由于制造简易，取材方便，已在全国推广；另一种较精密的插秧机也已试验成功，随着国家工业的发展，也将投入生产。最近又出现了多种多样的深耕农具，有畜力深耕犁，有绞关深耕犁，有动力绳索牵引犁，也有机引深耕犁。所有这些研究成果，显示出我国农业机械科学研究工作欣欣向荣的气象。是不是说我国农业机械科学研究工作成果及其发展速度已经可以满足当前和今后经济发展的需要了呢？还不能这样说。尽管我们研究成绩很大，进展速度很快，但就我国今年工农业大跃进与今后机械化发展的要求来说，还是很不相适应的。农业生产发展得这样迅速，如果不加强农业科学和农业机械的研究工作，不更多更好更快地提供那些效率高、质量好和成本低的新机器，必然影响到工农业生产的大跃进。例如现在全国已开展了小麦亩产千斤运动，毫无疑问，全国将会出现大量的千斤丰产田，这就要求高效率的小麦收割机，而这种工具我们还正在创造研究中，还没有最后成功。又如去年秋季，我国不少地区的薯类出现了大面积丰收，亩产数万斤，很需要一种效率高、质量好的薯类挖掘机来满足薯类收获的需要，但我们直到现在还没有合适的收获机。又如我国1958年棉花获得空前丰收，采棉需要劳动力很多，也需要一种棉花收获机解决劳力不足问题，但我们目前也没有这样的收获机。而且，因为我国地区辽阔，自然条件复杂，在地形方面有平原、山区、高原、丘陵、沼泽地；在土地利用方面有水田、旱田、坡地、梯田；在耕作技术方面有平作、垅作、畦作、套作。农作物种类繁多，不同地区有不同的栽培方法。这就规定了我国农业机械型号的多样性和复杂性，特别是去年农业大跃进，在耕作技术上总结出了“八字宪法”，对农业机械的要求就更高了。所有这一切都说明我们当前的农业机械科学研究工作，不是已经走到了生产需要的前面，而是还不能赶上我国农业生产高速度发展的需要。
    但是，我们完全有信心作好农业机械的研究工作，在党的领导和培养下，我们已经有一支日益壮大的农业机械研究工作者的队伍，而且已经找到了密切联系实际和密切联系群众的科学研究方法。农业机械研究工作者应该继续深入实际深入群众，虚心向群众学习，并和群众一起，把广大群众在大跃进中所发明创造的各种工具加以研究，就一定会得出良好的结果。各个农业机械研究部门，应该广泛开展经验交流，进行技术大协作，使科学研究工作的成果更加丰硕。在这方面我们有着丰富的经验：江西正在推广的红旗号水稻插秧机，就是在吸取了华中农业科学研究所创造的插秧机和插秧船的优点的基础上创造成功的。江苏李兆森同志创造了风力绳索牵引机，北京农业机械化研究所在总结这个经验和参考福建电犁的基础上创造了电动绳索牵引机。互相取长补短的技术交流的办法，是一种多快好省的方法，而这种办法只有在社会主义制度的国家里才能办到，因为我们懂得发明创造的目的是为了集体，为了加速社会主义建设。因此我们应适当地举办一些农业机械经验交流会、评比会或采用送技术上门的办法，广泛交流经验。
    在开展农业机械科学研究的同时，还要逐步进行农业机械的鉴定工作，每件农具在大量推广以前，努力争取经过大面积试验，进行切实的鉴定，考核农具的适应性、经济性和可靠性。对于经过实地试验证明合乎农业要求，坚固可靠，经济合算的机器，再投入生产大量制造。对外国或外地引进的农机具也要经过试验，证明合乎当地要求后再大量推广。事实证明，不经过鉴定或不认真鉴定，在推广中就容易造成损失。农业机械科学工作要全面贯彻总路线，既要多快，也要好省；既反对那种畏缩不前的作风，也反对那种不做鉴定就盲目推广的做法。
    目前全国各地正在开展一个规模更大、范围更广、更深入更实际的工具改革运动，各地农业机械科学研究机关必须在各级党委领导下，与群众性的工具改革运动密切结合，有计划有步骤地开展农业机械科学研究工作，促进1959年农业更大跃进；并为今后农业机械化电气化做好技术准备。
