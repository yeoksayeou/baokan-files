    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the North Atlantic aggression group planned and led by the United States, has been in existence for a full decade. This has been a decade in which U.S. imperialism, through this group, has launched frenzied attacks on world peace, on the national rights, national sovereignty, and living standards of all peoples; it is also a decade in which U.S. imperialism, opposed by the peace-loving peoples of all countries who cherish independence and the right to survival, has suffered shameful defeats and become increasingly isolated. The aggressive essence of this group, wrapped in the tattered cloth of "collective defense," has been fully exposed! The "unity" maintained by this group with "collective security" has also been punctured by the acute contradictions among its member states, and is increasingly heading towards disintegration. As early as ten years ago, when the "North Atlantic Treaty" was first signed, the Soviet government warned that the establishment of such an organization would bring serious consequences for the cause of peace and international cooperation. The various parties in our country, led by the Chinese Communist Party, also issued a joint statement exposing this treaty as one aimed at provoking a new world war of aggression and endangering human peace and security, and pointed out that the struggle of the world's peace and democracy forces, led by the Soviet Union, against the danger of new war will cause the imperialists who plot war and their running dogs in various countries to be blamed and isolated by the peace-loving people of the world, and will bankrupt the conspiracy of a new world war of aggression. Over the past decade, events have unfolded precisely in this way.
    The entire activities of the North Atlantic Group over the past decade are inseparable from the U.S. imperialist ambition to dominate and enslave the whole world. U.S. imperialism has tried to launch a war of aggression against the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries. To achieve this sinister goal, the United States has organized a frantic arms race within the North Atlantic Group. In December 1950, it was decided to establish a Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Group led by a U.S. general, to plan and organize an integrated army of aggression, and at the same time to begin establishing U.S. military bases throughout the territories of the European member states. In September 1951, it was decided to drag Greece and Turkey, which had nothing to do with the North Atlantic, into the group as forward bases for advancing into the socialist countries of Eastern Europe. In May 1955, West Germany became a member of the North Atlantic Group. In May 1957, the Bonn meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council decided to legalize West German atomic armament, which further exposed the aggressive essence of the North Atlantic Group's preparation to launch an atomic war, and made the militarists of West Germany a shock force in a new war of aggression.
    In order to promote the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war, the North Atlantic Group has consistently created and maintained international tensions and poisoned the international atmosphere. Throughout its entire ten-year history, the North Atlantic Group has never put forward even a single proposal that would help peacefully resolve international disputes and promote international cooperation. On the contrary, it has rejected all suggestions made by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries that would be beneficial to world peace. Everyone knows that whenever the measures taken by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries lead to some relaxation of the international situation, the main member states of the North Atlantic Group try every means to take countermeasures and re-intensify the tensions. For example: after the Korean armistice in 1953, they immediately attempted to expand the Indochina war; after the Indochina armistice in 1954, they immediately cobbled together the Southeast Asia military bloc; after the Geneva Conference of the Heads of State of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France, held in 1955 at the initiative of the Soviet Union, created a good international atmosphere, they launched an anti-Soviet and anti-communist upsurge in 1956 and then launched the war of aggression against Egypt; in 1957 they conspired to subvert Syria; in 1958 they again armed and invaded Lebanon and Jordan; and so on. All this proves that the North Atlantic Group, headed by the United States, regards creating tension as its trump card for carrying out aggression, and that the North Atlantic Group is the main tool of the United States for undermining world peace.
    The arms expansion and war preparations, the intensification of international tensions, and all acts of aggression by the North Atlantic Group are carried out under the smokescreen of opposing the so-called "communist threat" and preventing the so-called "Soviet aggression." However, the facts of the ten years since the establishment of the North Atlantic Group have powerfully proved that none of its member states has ever been threatened or invaded by the Soviet Union. On the contrary, what truly threatens, violates, and harms them is not the Soviet Union, but their "protector," the United States. Under the guise of anti-Sovietism and anti-communism, the United States has invaded and seized their markets, controlled their territories, and violated their sovereignty. U.S. military bases have not brought security to these countries and peoples, but will cause these countries to suffer devastating disasters in the event of war. The military spending of more than 500 billion U.S. dollars over the past decade has greatly increased the financial burden of various countries and brought about serious economic crises. In the North Atlantic Group countries, there has been a decline in production, an increase in unemployment, and the increasing impoverishment of the working people.
    The aggressive essence of the North Atlantic Group is also manifested in its being the mortal enemy of national liberation movements and the chief culprit in aggression against Asia and Africa. This group is mainly composed of colonialist countries, which determines its reactionary essence of suppressing national liberation movements. The North Atlantic Group has tried its best to maintain the collapsing colonial system and continue to exploit and plunder the manpower and resources of Asian and African colonies and semi-colonies. Although U.S. imperialism has repeatedly stated that it has nothing to do with the suppression of national liberation movements in the colonies by Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, the ironclad facts are that countless people in Algeria, Cameroon, Nyasaland, Kenya, the Belgian Congo, West Irian, and other regions are being killed by U.S. weapons nominally supplied to the North Atlantic Group. Under the auspices of the United States, the North Atlantic Group Council has also discussed the situation in Africa more than once. The North Atlantic Group has not only stipulated for itself the task of suppressing national liberation movements, but also vainly attempted to re-impose the colonial yoke that has already been broken by the people of many countries in Asia on their heads. The North Atlantic Group Council in December 1957 and May 1958 openly placed the issue of the situation in Indonesia on the agenda and carried out shameless interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.
    As everyone knows, the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" and the "Baghdad Pact" are also actually centered on the United States, Britain, and France. The United States, Britain, and France used these two aggressive organizations to establish military bases in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, strengthen economic infiltration, plot military coups, and organize subversion activities, and intensify their control over countries that are striving for and maintaining national independence. Everyone also knows that the U.S. and British troops who invaded Lebanon and Jordan used the military bases of the North Atlantic Group set up in the territories of West Germany, Italy, and Turkey. All this shows that the aggressive activities of the North Atlantic Group have gone far beyond the scope of Europe. A global aggressive system centered on the North Atlantic Group and linking the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" and the "Baghdad Pact" these aggressive military groups has in fact been manifested in the actual activities of the North Atlantic Group. To say that the North Atlantic Group is a "regional collective defense" is nothing but a complete lie.
    However, today's world is ultimately a world of the people, not a world where imperialism can run rampant. Despite its ambitions and its rampant acts of aggression, the North Atlantic Group has achieved results in the past decade that are completely contrary to its wishes. Under the relentless exposure and heavy blows from the world's peace forces led by the Soviet Union, the North Atlantic Group's aggressive plans have suffered one failure after another, and its internal contradictions have become increasingly acute.
    First of all, the situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, especially the achievements of Soviet science and technology in the past two or three years, has completely shattered the myth of the U.S. "superiority in strength," and has triggered a "crisis of confidence" within the North Atlantic Group. The allies of the United States dare not entrust their fate entirely to the United States. Britain has proposed "mutual dependence," France has demanded a "big three core," and other countries have unanimously demanded the strengthening of political consultations. The absolute leadership of the United States within the North Atlantic Group has been shaken, and the open and covert struggles between the United States and its allies for control and counter-control are developing. The contradictions within the North Atlantic Group are developing into a life-and-death mutual infighting. This is not only manifested in the economic field, such as the struggle over the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area," and in the political field, such as the differences in resolving the German question, but also clearly manifested in the military field, such as France's regaining command of the Mediterranean fleet, which is the latest prominent event.
    The powerful socialist camp, the surging anti-colonialist movement, the conflict of interests and the trend of division and disintegration within the North Atlantic Group, and the opposition of the vast number of people in the North Atlantic Group member states to the arms expansion and war preparations and the demand to eliminate the "Cold War" - all this has made the North Atlantic Group increasingly paralyzed and isolated, and has encountered increasing difficulties in promoting its aggressive policies.
    Although the peace-loving countries and peoples all over the world are eagerly hoping to ease international tensions and quickly thaw the so-called "Cold War," U.S. imperialism and its followers will not stop their aggressive plans because they have suffered difficulties. They fantasize about relying on international tensions, stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, getting rid of the economic crisis, and continuing to implement their policies of expansion and aggression. Isn't the meeting of the North Atlantic Alliance Council opening in Washington today an attempt to mend the internal rifts and spur its allies to reorganize the banner of aggression! The Soviet government issued a statement on March 29, requesting that the governments of the North Atlantic Group countries take advantage of the opportunity when the "North Atlantic Treaty" expires after ten years to review and revise the treaty, to include clauses in the treaty on not giving any aggressor military and economic assistance or moral support, and reiterated the proposal to conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, requesting the North Atlantic Group Council's Washington meeting to respond to the Soviet Union's peace initiative and take measures together with the Soviet Union to solve a series of major and urgently needed international problems. This statement by the Soviet government is another major effort made in the interests of peace. The Chinese people, together with all peace-loving people in the world, warmly support the Soviet government's peace efforts. If the North Atlantic Group continues to stubbornly pursue a policy of creating tensions, implementing expansion and aggression, then it can only make its internal contradictions more acute, it can only further expose their faces as the vicious enemies of world peace, and make the people of the world increasingly aware, united, and mobilized, in order to eliminate tensions and eliminate the threat of war, and bury this aggressive military group together with all its aggressive policies!

    北大西洋侵略集团的十年
    美国所策划和领导的北大西洋侵略集团——北大西洋公约组织，成立迄今整整十年了。这是美帝国主义利用这个集团向世界和平，向各国人民的民族权利、国家主权和生活水平发动猖狂进攻的十年；也是美帝国主义在爱好和平、珍视独立和生存权利的各国人民的反对下，不断遭受可耻的失败和日益孤立的十年。这个集团用“集体防御”的破布包起来的侵略实质，已经完全暴露了！这个集团用“集体安全”所维系的“团结”，也被各成员国之间的尖锐矛盾所戳破，而日益走向四分五裂了。远在十年前刚刚签订“北大西洋公约”的时刻，苏联政府就提出警告说，建立这种组织会给和平和国际合作事业带来严重的后果。我国以中国共产党为首的各党派也发表联合声明，揭露这是一个以挑动新的世界侵略战争为目的的危害人类和平安全的条约，并且指出，以苏联为首的世界和平民主势力反对新战争危险的奋斗，将使策动战争的帝国主义者及其在各国的走狗们受到全世界和平人民的责备而陷于孤立，将使新的世界侵略战争的阴谋陷于破产。十年来，事情正是这样演变着的。
    北大西洋集团十年来的全部活动，是同美帝国主义的称霸和奴役全世界的野心分不开的。美帝国主义力图掀起一场反对苏联和社会主义阵营各国的侵略战争。为了实现这个罪恶目的，美国在北大西洋集团中组织了疯狂的军备竞赛。1950年12月决定建立由美国将军指挥的北大西洋集团最高司令部，筹划组织一支整体化的侵略军队，同时开始在各欧洲成员国的领土上普遍设立美国的军事基地。1951年9月决定把和北大西洋毫不相干的希腊、土耳其拉入集团，作为向东欧社会主义国家进军的前进基地。1955年5月，西德成为北大西洋集团的成员国，1957年5月，北大西洋集团理事会波恩会议决定使西德原子武装合法化，这样就进一步暴露了北大西洋集团准备发动原子战争的侵略实质，并且把西德的军国主义分子当作新的侵略战争中的突击力量。
  为了推行美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，北大西洋集团一贯制造和保持国际紧张局势，毒化国际气氛。北大西洋集团在它整整十年的历史中，从来没有提出过那怕是仅仅一项有助于和平解决国际争端和推进国际合作的建议。相反的，它拒绝了苏联和其他爱好和平国家的一切有利于世界和平的建议。谁都知道，每当苏联和其他爱好和平的国家所采取的措施使得国际局势得到某些缓和的时候，北大西洋集团主要成员国就千方百计地采取反措施，重新加剧紧张局势。譬如：1953年朝鲜停战之后，他们立即企图扩大印度支那战争；1954年印度支那停战后，他们马上拼凑东南亚军事集团；1955年在苏联倡议下举行的苏美英法四国首脑日内瓦会议创造良好国际气氛后，他们就在1956年掀起反苏反共高潮，随即发动侵略埃及的战争；1957年他们阴谋颠复叙利亚；1958年他们又武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦；等等。所有这些，完全可以证明，以美国为首的北大西洋集团把制造紧张局势作为它进行侵略的王牌，而北大西洋集团则是美国破坏世界和平的主要工具。
    北大西洋集团的扩军备战，加剧国际紧张局势和一切侵略活动，都是在反对所谓“共产主义威胁”和防止所谓“苏联侵略”的烟幕之下进行的。然而，北大西洋集团成立十年以来的事实有力地证明，它的任何成员国从来没有受到什么苏联的威胁或侵犯。恰恰相反，真正威胁，侵犯和损害他们的，不是苏联，而是他们的“保护者”美国。美国在反苏反共的幌子下，侵入和夺去他们的市场，控制了他们的国土，侵犯了他们的主权。美国的军事基地，不是给这些国家和人民带来了安全，而是一旦发生战争时，将使这些国家遭到毁灭性的灾难。十年来达五千亿以上美元的军费开支，大大地增加了各国的财政负担。带来了严重的经济危机。北大西洋集团各国都出现了生产下降、失业增加、劳动人民生活日益贫困的现象。
    北大西洋集团的侵略实质还表现在它是民族解放运动的死敌，是向亚非地区进行侵略的元凶。这个集团主要是由殖民主义国家组成的，这就决定了它的镇压民族解放运动的反动本质。北大西洋集团竭力企图维护已经瓦解的殖民体系，继续榨取和掠夺亚非殖民地和半殖民地的人力和资源。尽管美帝国主义一再表白自己同英、法、比、荷这些国家对殖民地民族解放运动的镇压活动无关，但是，铁的事实却是，阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆、尼亚萨兰、怯尼亚、比属刚果、西伊里安等等地区的无数人民正是被名义上输送给北大西洋集团的美国武器所杀害的。在美国的主持下，北大西洋集团理事会也不止一次地讨论了非洲的局势问题。北大西洋集团不仅为自己规定了镇压民族解放运动的任务，而且还妄想把已经被亚洲许多国家的人民挣脱了的殖民枷锁重新套在他们的头上。1957年12月和1958年5月的北大西洋集团理事会公然把印度尼西亚局势的问题列入议程，对印度尼西亚的内政进行无耻的干涉。
    大家知道，“东南亚条约组织”和“巴格达条约”也都是实际上以美、英、法为核心的。美国和英、法利用这两个侵略组织，在东南亚和中东地区建立军事基地，加强经济渗透，策动军事政变和组织颠复活动，加紧对争取和维护民族独立国家的控制。大家也知道，侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的美英军队是利用了设置在西德、意大利和土耳其领土上的北大西洋集团的军事基地的。这一切都说明了北大西洋集团的侵略活动已经远远超出了欧洲的范围。一个以北大西洋集团为核心而把“东南亚条约组织”和“巴格达条约”这些侵略性军事集团联结起来的全球性侵略体系，事实上已经在北大西洋集团的实际活动中表现出来了。说北大西洋集团是什么“区域性的集体防御”，这不过是彻头彻尾的谎言而已。
    然而，今天的世界究竟是人民的世界，而不是帝国主义可以横行霸道的世界了。北大西洋集团尽管野心勃勃，它的侵略活动也尽管十分猖狂，十年来它却得到了和它的愿望完全相反的结果。在以苏联为首的世界和平力量给予无情的揭露和沉重的打击下，北大西洋集团的侵略计划遭受到一次又一次的失败，它的内部矛盾也日益激化。
    首先是东风压倒西风的形势，特别是近两三年来苏联科学技术的成就，彻底打破了美国“实力优势”的神话，引起了北大西洋集团内部的“信任危机”。美国的盟国不敢把自己的命运全权付托给美国，英国提出“互相依赖”，法国要求“三巨头核心”，其他国家也异口同声地要求加强政治磋商。美国在北大西洋集团内部的绝对领导权已经动摇，美国和它的盟国之间控制和反控制的明争暗斗正在发展。北大西洋集团内部的矛盾正发展为你死我活的互相倾轧。这不仅表现在经济方面如“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”问题上的斗争，在政治方面如在解决德国问题上的分歧，而且也明显地表现在军事方面，如法国收回地中海舰队的指挥权，就是最新的一个突出事件。
    强大的社会主义阵营，风起云涌的反殖民主义运动，北大西洋集团内部利害冲突和四分五裂的趋向，北大西洋集团成员国国内广大人民反对扩军备战，要求消除“冷战”的运动，所有这一切都使得北大西洋集团日趋瘫痪与孤立，在推行它的侵略政策方面遭到了越来越大的困难了。
    尽管全世界爱好和平的国家与人民，热切希望缓和国际紧张局势，使所谓“冷战”迅速解冻，但是，美帝国主义及其追随者是不会由于遭受困难而就此收敛起他们的侵略计划的。他们幻想凭借国际紧张局势，加紧扩军备战，摆脱经济危机，并继续实行扩张和侵略政策。今天，在华盛顿开幕的北大西洋联盟理事会会议，不正是企图弥合内部的裂痕，鞭策它的盟国重整侵略的旗鼓吗！苏联政府3月29日发表声明，要求北大西洋集团各国政府利用“北大西洋公约”期满十年可以重新审查和修改公约的机会，在公约中列入关于不得给予任何侵略者以军事和经济上的援助或是道义上的支持的条款，重提北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织之间缔结互不侵犯条约的建议，要求北大西洋集团理事会华盛顿会议响应苏联的和平倡议，同苏联一道采取措施解决一系列重大的、迫切需要解决的国际问题。苏联政府这一声明，是本着和平的利益而作出的又一次重大努力。中国人民同世界一切爱好和平的人民一道，热烈支持苏联政府的和平努力。如果北大西洋集团继续顽固地奉行制造紧张局势，实行扩张、侵略的政策，那么，只能使它们内部矛盾更加尖锐化，只能更加暴露它们是世界和平的凶恶敌人的面貌，使全世界人民日益觉悟起来、团结起来、动员起来，为了消除紧张局势，消除战争的威胁，而把这个侵略性的军事集团连同它的全部侵略政策一齐埋葬掉！
