Hanoi, April 10th (by this newspaper) - Workers in thirty enterprises of the Vietnamese transportation and postal systems, displaying the spirit of "daring to think, daring to do, and boldly creating," have submitted more than 3,000 rationalization proposals and inventions from the second half of last year to the first quarter of this year. More than 2,000 of these have been adopted, including using banana tree fibers to make rags for cleaning heavy machinery, self-manufacturing bicycle tires using domestic raw materials, self-manufacturing automatic on/off navigational lights for night and day, converting to the use of Vietnam's abundant anthracite coal to power automobiles instead of gasoline, self-manufacturing electric meters, and self-manufacturing telephone switchboards. These more than 2,000 rationalization proposals and inventions encompass almost every production sector of railway, waterway, and highway transportation, as well as postal and telecommunications. Many projects have increased work and production efficiency fivefold, and some have even increased it tenfold or twentyfold.

These inventions and creations have emerged from the Vietnamese Labor Party's movement to "improve enterprise management," in which workers in various enterprises participate. This movement puts forward the slogan "Dare to think, dare to do, boldly create, and be good masters of the enterprise."

The Vietnamese Labor Party's extensive promotion of cultural and technical education in enterprises is also one of the important reasons for the large number of inventions and creations. At present, in the thirty enterprises of the Vietnamese transportation and postal systems, from ordinary workers to junior technicians, all are enrolled in various study classes to varying degrees.

The models and actual objects of more than 2,000 rationalization proposals and inventions have been on display in Hanoi since the 7th, and have been warmly praised by people from all walks of life.

Nguyen Van Tran, Minister of Transportation and Postal Affairs of Vietnam, pointed out at the opening ceremony of the exhibition on the 7th that this is only a good start to the mass technological reform movement. In the future, it is necessary to further expand it to every enterprise, construction site, factory workshop, and team, making it a broader mass movement.

　　越南交通邮电职工大胆创造
　　半年多来提出了三千多件合理化建议
    本报河内10日电　越南交通、邮电系统三十个企业的职工发挥“敢想敢做、大胆创造”的精神，从去年下半年到今年第一季度，提出了三千多件合理化建议和发明创造。其中二千多件已经被采用，包括利用芭蕉树的纤维制成洗擦重型机器的抹布，利用国内原料自制自行车轮胎，自制在黑夜和白昼能够自动开关的航海标灯，改用越南丰富的无烟煤代替汽油发动汽车，自制电表，自制电话交换台，这二千多件合理化建议和发明创造几乎包括铁路、水路、公路交通和邮电的各个生产部门。有许多项目使工作和生产效率提高五倍，有的甚至提高十倍、二十倍。
    这些发明创造是越南劳动党在各企业组织工人参加“改进企业管理”的运动中出现的。这个运动提出了“敢想敢做、大胆创造、作好企业的主人”的口号。
    越南劳动党在企业里广泛开展文化和技术教育也是发明创造大量出现的重要原因之一。目前，在越南交通、邮电系统的三十个企业中，从普通工人到初级技术人员都按不同的程度编入了各种学习班。
    二千多件合理化建议和发明创造的模型和实物已经从7日开始在河内展出，受到了各界人民的热烈赞扬。
    越南交通邮电部部长阮文珍7日在展览会开幕式上指出，这只是群众性的技术改革运动的良好开始。今后，要进一步把它扩大到每一个企业、工地、工厂的每一个车间和小组里去，使它成为更加广泛的群众性运动。
