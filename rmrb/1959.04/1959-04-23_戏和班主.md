	The Play and the Stage Manager

	The Indian "Free Press" said on the 20th: "The fanciful news sent by foreign reporters from their chartered planes over Tezpur gives us an understanding of how the Dalai Lama's play is being used by the West to achieve the goals of the Cold War." The newspaper pointed out, "It would be a regrettable mistake if Indian public opinion were tempted and followed the West on this point." (Quoted from the People's Daily, April 22)
	This warning is correct, and we see that there are indeed many wise people among our Indian friends. However, the so-called "Dalai Lama's play" is somewhat misnamed. The real performers of this play are not the Dalai Lama, but a hodgepodge of disreputable clowns. The purpose of this farce is by no means limited to a general Cold War, but to split China's unity and achieve the hot war goal of seizing the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, the stage manager of this troupe is trying hard to incite in India, wanting to turn the friendly Chinese and Indian people into enemies, in order to facilitate their realization of expansionist dreams. And the "fanciful news" of the Western "foreign reporters" is precisely to use the ambition of the Indian expansionists to fan the flames, in order to achieve their goal of further controlling the Indian people. This is the real danger of this play, and also the regrettable aspect of this mistake. Therefore, this play should not be called "Dalai Lama's play" but should be called a puppet farce directed by a foreign stage manager and performed by a small group of Chinese Tibetan scum.
	The troupe was formed long ago, and it is that small group of national scum in the Tibetan upper ruling group who betray the country and seek glory, recognizing thieves as fathers, such as Lhoka, Trijang Lobsang Yeshe, Xiasu, Sokang and the like. The old stage manager was originally British, and the current stage manager is an Indian expansionist. However, this troupe is really shameful, unable to support the stage, and unable to attract the audience. Therefore, the stage manager lords are doing everything possible to "recruit stars" and abduct the Dalai Lama. They even came up with a so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," and then they started to perform "Dalai Lama's play" in full swing.
	The play is extremely ruined. First of all, the actors are terrible. The protagonist who was named refuses to appear on stage. Indian officials said that he "is still unwilling to read this statement to reporters, but he is being persuaded to do so." Who is persuading him? Has he been persuaded? I don't know. But this so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" was "read in Tibetan by an attendant of the Dalai Lama." And the English version of this pre-printed "statement" (it is still unclear which is the true version, the English version or the Tibetan version) was "distributed to news reporters by S. Sen, Joint Secretary of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs." What an enthusiastic secretary of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs! What a talented actor! In short, the Dalai Lama did not personally appear on stage, and the so-called "Dalai Lama's play" had to be played by someone else.
	Secondly, the script is terrible. You only need to look at the "theater reviews" in the Indian newspapers. The special correspondent of "The Hindu" Rangaswami said, "There is an impression here that the Dalai Lama's statement has many loopholes." The Bengali daily "Yugantar" said, "It is difficult to accept the Buddhist King's political statement satisfactorily." The political reporter of "The Statesman" regretfully noted that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement was not issued in the first person," "giving the impression that the Dalai Lama is restricted." In short, people are skeptical of its authenticity. It is really difficult for those "playwrights" who are writing on behalf of others, they have to fabricate out of thin air and also be pretentious, how can they write a work with a sense of reality? Moreover, how much local Tibetan color does that "European style or quasi-European style" foreign accent have? How can it not make people feel sour and disgusting?
	With such a terrible troupe, such a terrible script, and such a stupid stage manager, how can they hope that their luck will improve?

    戏和班主
    董逢亚
    印度“自由新闻”在20日说：“外国记者在提斯浦尔上空从他们包租的飞机上发出的富于空想的消息，使我们了解到达赖喇嘛的戏正在如何被西方利用来达到冷战的目的。”这家报纸指出，“如果印度舆论在这一点上受到诱惑和追随西方的话，那将是可悲的错误。”（引自4月22日人民日报）
    这种警告是对的，我们看到了，在我们的印度朋友中，的确有着许多明智的人。不过，所谓“达赖喇嘛的戏”却有些名不符实。这个戏的真正演出者其实并非达赖喇嘛，而是一些不孚众望的丑角们的杂凑。这种丑剧的演出，目的也决不止于一般的冷战，而是想分裂中国的统一，达到攫取中华人民共和国的西藏地方的热战目的。因而这个戏班子的班主正极力在印度进行煽动，想把友好的中印人民，变成仇敌，以便利于他们实现扩张主义的梦想。而西方“外国记者”的“空想消息”，正是想利用印度扩张主义者的这种野心而放火煽风，以便达到他们更进一步控制印度人民的目的。这才是这种戏的真正的危险性，也是这种错误的可悲处。所以这戏不能叫作“达赖喇嘛的戏”而应该叫作由外国班主牵线的，由一小撮中国的西藏败类们演出的傀儡丑剧。
    戏班子早就组成了，这就是西藏上层统治集团里的那一小撮卖国求荣、认贼作父的民族败类，像什么鲁康娃、赤江·罗桑意西、夏苏、索康等等之流。老班主原先是英国人，现在的班主是印度的扩张主义分子。不过这个班子实在见不得人，撑不起台面，拉不住观众。因此，班主老爷们才千方百计地要“拉角”，把达赖喇嘛劫持而去。居然还弄出了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，于是紧锣密鼓地演起“达赖喇嘛的戏”来了。
    戏演得实在坍台极了。首先是演员的糟。被挂了名的主角不肯上场。印度官方人士说，他“至今是不愿向记者宣读这个声明的，但是他正在被说服这样作。”谁去说服呢？说服了没有呢？不知道。但这个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，却是“由达赖喇嘛的一个随员用藏语宣读的。”而这个事先印好的“声明”的英文本（英文本和藏文本究竟哪个是真本，现在也还弄不清）却是“由印度外交部联合秘书斯·森散发给新闻记者的”。多么热心的印度外交部的秘书先生啊！多么富有天才的演员啊！总之是达赖喇嘛没有亲身上场，而所谓“达赖喇嘛的戏”，只好叫别人客串了。
    其次是戏文的糟。这只要看看印度报纸的“剧评”就行了。“印度教徒报”的特派记者兰加斯瓦米说“这里有这样一种印象：达赖喇嘛的声明有许多漏洞。”孟加拉文日报“划时代报”说：“很难满意地接受佛王的这个政治声明”。“政治家报”的政治记者遗憾地注意到：所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明并不是以第一人称发表的”，“给人以达赖喇嘛是受到束缚的印象。”总之，人们是怀疑它的真实性的。这真是难为煞那些“剧作家”们了，替人越俎代庖，既要凭空捏造，又要矫揉造作，怎样会写出有真实感的作品来呢？而且，那“欧洲文体或准欧洲文体”的洋腔洋调，又有哪一点带有西藏地方色彩？它怎不使人感到酸溜溜的怪肉麻的呢？
    这样糟糕的班子，这样糟糕的戏文，又是这样蠢才的班主，他们怎能希望运道变好起来呢？
