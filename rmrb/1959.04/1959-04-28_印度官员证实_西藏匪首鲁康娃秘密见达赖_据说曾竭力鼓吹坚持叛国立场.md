Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: New Delhi dispatch: The "Indian Times" reported today that "Indian officials responsible for liaison work for the Dalai Lama" confirmed the news that Lhukangwa, the leader of the Tibetan rebel bandits entrenched in Kalimpong, India, met with the Dalai Lama in Mussoorie on April 25th. The newspaper added that Lhukangwa met with the Dalai Lama for the second time on April 26th.

The newspaper said that the bandit leader Lhukangwa arrived in Mussoorie on April 23rd, accompanied by his "advisors," "entourage," and his two sons who are "studying" in Darjeeling. The newspaper also said that the Dalai Lama's brother, the rebel Gyalo Thondup, also reportedly arrived in Mussoorie on the same day. According to Indian newspapers and Western news agencies in recent days, after Lhukangwa first met with the Dalai Lama, he held "lengthy talks" with the Tibetan rebel leaders who hijacked the Dalai Lama to India.

The "Indian Times" said that it is not yet known what Lhukangwa talked about with the Dalai Lama, but "informed sources believe that Lhukangwa wanted the Dalai Lama to take immediate action." Another source said that the bandit leader Lhukangwa vigorously advocated during his meeting with the Dalai Lama that he should adhere to his shameless position of "complete independence of Tibet," which is aimed at splitting the motherland and betraying the interests of the Tibetan people.

The "Indian Times" said that the first meeting between Lhukangwa and the Dalai Lama was "extremely secret." It was not until late at night when an Indian official responsible for liaison work for the Dalai Lama confirmed the news that everyone knew about it.

    印度官员证实
    西藏匪首鲁康娃秘密见达赖
    据说曾竭力鼓吹坚持叛国立场
    新华社27日讯　新德里消息：“印度时报”今天报道，“负责为达赖喇嘛作联络工作的印度官员”证实了这样一个消息：盘踞在印度噶伦堡的西藏叛匪首领鲁康娃曾经在4月25日在穆索里见了达赖喇嘛。这家报纸又说，4月26日鲁康娃第二次见了达赖喇嘛。
    这家报纸说，匪首鲁康娃是在4月23日到达穆索里的，与他同行的有他的“顾问们”、“随从们”和他的两个在大吉岭“念书”的儿子。这家报纸还说，达赖喇嘛的哥哥、叛匪嘉乐登珠据说也在同一天到达穆索里。据最近几天印度报纸和西方通讯社报道，鲁康娃在第一次见到达赖喇嘛以后，曾经同劫持达赖喇嘛前往印度的西藏叛匪首领们进行了“长时间的会谈”。
    “印度时报”说，鲁康娃在同达赖喇嘛的见面当中究竟谈了些什么，现在还不能说，但是“消息灵通人士认为，鲁康娃曾经要达赖喇嘛马上采取行动。”另外有消息说，匪首鲁康娃在同达赖喇嘛见面时竭力鼓吹，他要坚持他的“西藏完全独立”这一分裂祖国、背叛西藏民族利益的无耻立场。
    “印度时报”说，鲁康娃同达赖喇嘛的第一次会见是“极端秘密的”。只是到深夜一个负责为达赖喇嘛作联络工作的印度官员证实这个消息的时候，大家才知道这件事。
