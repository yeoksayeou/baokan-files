Combine Teaching, Productive Labor, and Scientific Research

The Party's educational policy is to cultivate students into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. In any school, any subject, and any class, the principle of combining education with productive labor should be implemented without exception, according to different circumstances and methods. Students should receive moral, intellectual, and physical education to become well-rounded individuals. When universities and colleges implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, they must closely integrate teaching, productive labor, and scientific research to implement the educational principle of combining theory with practice, continuously improve the quality of education, and meet the needs of socialist construction.

Currently, most universities and colleges have already combined teaching, productive labor, and scientific research to varying degrees. Schools that have combined them well and arranged them properly have continuously improved the quality of teaching, achieved fruitful production results, and seen a flourishing of scientific research. This is a brilliant victory of the educational revolution. In order to consolidate and develop the educational revolution, all universities and colleges should, on the existing basis, summarize experience, make further progress, and strive for greater results.

Practice has proven that the combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research should be centered on teaching. Productive labor and scientific research should be conducted around teaching. Why should teaching be the center? Because the main task of schools is teaching. Full-time universities and colleges are different from factories and farms, different from the spare-time schools for workers and farmers, and different from scientific research institutions. Therefore, they must take teaching as their main task, teach students well, and guide them in their studies. Full-time universities and colleges also shoulder the task of improvement in teaching. They must improve the quality of teaching, improve the level of various disciplines, and strengthen the teaching of basic theoretical knowledge as well as specialized courses. This requires that productive labor and scientific research must be centered on teaching and serve the requirement of improving the quality of teaching. When teaching, productive labor, and scientific research have become important contents of school work, it is necessary to clearly define the relationship between the three, integrate them into a whole, overcome contradictions, and promote each other.

In universities and colleges, the combination of teaching and productive labor is mainly reflected in the combination of majors and productive labor. According to the Party's educational policy, industrial and agricultural colleges have established factories and farms in conjunction with their majors where possible, or have linked up with factories and people's communes to carry out productive labor and on-site teaching. Some schools have formulated internship outlines for productive labor according to the requirements of the teaching plan, so that teaching is closely integrated with productive labor, and significant achievements have been made. However, there are different opinions on how liberal arts and science can be combined with production and social practice. For example, some people believe that "mathematics is abstract reasoning" and "mathematics is symbols" and cannot be combined with production. However, once mathematics students are connected with production, they find that there are a large number of mathematical problems in actual life. Summarizing and solving those problems enriches and promotes the improvement of mathematics teaching. For example, some people believe that "history is the science of studying the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. How can it be combined with production?" However, when history students go to factories and rural areas, they become familiar with the production process, exercise physical labor, participate in social practice, write the history of struggles in factories and rural areas, change their fundamental views on history, and promote the reform of history teaching. Using these methods of combining teaching with productive labor also naturally combines scientific research work. Of course, the combination of professional teaching and productive labor or social practice cannot be completely consistent. Some are direct, while others are indirect. Schools can create conditions to organically and flexibly organize productive labor and social practice, and combine them with professional learning as much as possible to improve teaching. Some people believe that only by directly combining productive labor with professional teaching can the policy of combining education with productive labor be implemented; otherwise, it cannot be implemented. Such an understanding of the Party's educational policy is one-sided. Productive labor can not only combine with professional teaching to improve students' professional knowledge, but also combine with moral and physical education to improve students' ideology and physique. Some schools propose: "Everyone participates in production, everyone's thinking turns red, run professional factories well, and also go to the countryside to work." Such flexible productive labor can enable students to achieve a comprehensive harvest of thought, knowledge, and physique. Practice tells us that students can participate in productive labor in three basic forms: one is to participate in labor in farms and factories run by the school, one is to participate in labor in rural areas and factories arranged by the school, and one is to participate in social public welfare labor. All types of schools should flexibly adopt different forms of productive labor according to their different characteristics. In addition to regularly producing some products, science, engineering, agriculture, and medical majors should also apply new technologies to trial-produce new products in conjunction with the needs of national construction. Social science majors should spend more time going to factories and rural areas to participate in productive labor, and should also participate in social work and conduct investigations and research in conjunction with productive labor.

The Party's educational policy requires the combination of education and productive labor, which is to further implement the principle of combining theory with practice. The combination of theory and practice will inevitably improve the original theory and develop new theories, so as to guide practice and promote the development of scientific research. The development of scientific research, in turn, continuously improves the quality of teaching and enriches teaching content with new achievements, promoting technological revolution in production. The mysteries of nature and mankind are constantly being revealed, and science is developing rapidly. If the teaching work of universities and colleges used to be satisfied with imparting established scientific conclusions, then in the process of implementing the Party's educational policy, it is necessary to continuously supplement the latest scientific achievements in the textbooks and guide students to find scientific answers to new problems in the practice of production and social change. At the same time, the scientific research conducted by universities and colleges should not only cultivate a new generation, but also directly serve national production and construction or national defense construction. Therefore, some universities and colleges pay attention to both completing the tasks assigned by the state and taking care of the requirements of teaching work when conducting scientific research. Students participate in scientific research in conjunction with productive labor, generally not fixed for a long time, but are assigned to participate in different aspects and different types of work at different times according to their learning content. This enables students to receive more comprehensive training and is conducive to better mastering the theory.

To be centered on teaching and combine productive labor and scientific research, it is necessary to make comprehensive arrangements for teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. It is necessary to attach importance to productive labor, as well as classroom teaching; to practice, as well as to reading. It is one-sided to only read and not work, and it is also one-sided to only work and not read. Only by practicing and reading at the same time can we cultivate working-class intellectuals who are both socialist-minded and culturally knowledgeable. Comprehensive arrangement of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research is very meticulous and complex work. In the comprehensive arrangement, all courses, all productive labor tasks, and all scientific research tasks of different departments should be considered comprehensively according to the nature of the courses and different grades. Some universities and colleges require very meticulous arrangements for teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. For example, each department and each major must consider the ways and methods of arrangement based on the nature and training objectives of the unit, and the natural sciences and humanities are different. For example, arrangements should be made rationally according to the different nature of the courses, and basic courses, professional courses, and specialized courses are different. In the natural sciences, courses with strong experimental components are different from courses with strong theoretical components. Furthermore, different arrangements should be made for different grades, different labor training situations, and different levels of knowledge. If arrangements can be made so thoroughly and meticulously, teaching, productive labor, and scientific research will inevitably be just right. If we do not distinguish between different specific situations and simplify complex things, we will inevitably fail to achieve the best results. The arrangement problem is not just a matter of time. If we only consider it from the perspective of time, we will only mix the three together, rather than combine them. In our arrangements, we should pay attention not only to the arrangement of time, but also to the organic combination of content, so as to complement each other and improve each other, and achieve more achievements in a limited time. The comprehensive arrangement of time and the organic combination of content are unified. The comprehensive arrangement is for better combination, and only by organically combining the three from the content can we achieve a comprehensive arrangement in terms of time.

We believe that under the unified leadership of the Party, by mobilizing the masses and through the joint efforts of teachers and students, teaching, productive labor, and scientific research will be closely combined, and the Party's educational policy will be firmly and thoroughly implemented.

### 把教学、生产劳动、科学研究结合起来

    把教学、生产劳动、科学研究结合起来
    党的教育方针，是要培养学生成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，在任何学校、任何学科、任何班级，都应该毫无例外地根据不同情况，采取不同方法，贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，向学生进行德育、智育、体育的教育，使学生成为全面发展的人材。高等学校在贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针时，必须把教学、生产劳动和科学研究密切结合起来，才能贯彻理论和实际相结合的教育原则，不断提高教育质量，适应社会主义建设的要求。
    目前，在高等学校中，大都已经在不同程度上把教学、生产劳动和科学研究结合起来。凡是结合得好、安排得好的学校，教学质量不断提高，生产成绩硕果累累，科学研究百花齐放。这是教育革命的辉煌胜利。为了巩固和发展教育革命，各高等学校应当在现有基础上，总结经验，百尺竿头，更进一步，争取更大的成果。
    实践证明，教学、生产劳动、科学研究的结合，应该以教学为中心，围绕教学，进行生产劳动和科学研究。为什么要以教学为中心呢？因为学校的主要工作是教学。全日制的高等学校，不同于工厂、农场，不同于工人、农民的业余学校，也不同于科学研究机构。所以必须以教学工作为自己的主要任务。要把学生教好，指导学生学习。全日制的高等学校在教学方面还担负着提高的任务。它必须提高教学质量，提高各门学科的水平，它不仅要加强专业课的教学，还需要加强基础课理论知识的教学。这就要求生产劳动和科学研究必须以教学为中心，服从提高教学质量的要求。在教学、生产劳动和科学研究已经成为学校工作重要内容的时候，就必须明确规定三者之间的相互关系，使它们结为整体，克服矛盾，互相促进。
    在高等学校中，教学同生产劳动相结合，着重表现在专业同生产劳动相结合。工业院校和农业院校根据党的教育方针，已经在可能条件下结合专业办工厂和农场，或同工厂和人民公社挂钩，下厂下乡进行生产劳动和现场教学。有的学校根据教学计划的要求，制定生产劳动的实习大纲，使教学同生产劳动结合得很密切，作出了显著的成绩。但是，在文科、理科如何结合生产，结合社会实践，则有不同意见。例如，有人认为，“数学是抽象的推理”，“数学是符号”，不能结合生产。可是，数学系学生一经联系了生产，就发现实际生活中有大量的数学问题，把那些问题归纳起来加以解决，也就丰富和推动了数学教学工作的提高。又如，有人认为，“历史是研究三皇五帝的科学，如何能结合生产？”然而，历史系学生到了工厂、农村，通过生产过程的熟悉和体力劳动的锻炼，参加了社会实践，写出了工厂、农村的斗争历史，改变了对历史的根本观点，推动了历史教学的革新。采用这些教学结合生产劳动的办法，也就自然地结合了科学研究工作。当然，专业教学同生产劳动或社会实践的结合，不可能是完全一致的。有的是直接的，而有的则是间接的。学校可以创造条件，使生产劳动和社会实践经过有机地灵活地组织，同专业学习尽可能地结合起来，改进教学。有人认为，只有把生产劳动直接同专业教学结合起来，才能贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，否则就不能贯彻。这样地理解党的教育方针，是片面的。生产劳动既可以结合专业教学提高学生的专业知识，还可以结合德育、体育的教育来提高学生的思想和体质。有的学校提出：“人人参加生产，个个思想变红，办好专业工厂，还要下乡劳动。”这样灵活地进行生产劳动，就可以使学生达到思想、知识、体质的全面丰收。实践告诉我们：学生参加生产劳动，可以采取三种基本形式：一是在学校举办的农场和工厂中参加劳动，一是学校安排的下乡下厂的劳动，一是参加社会公益劳动。各类学校应该根据不同特点，灵活地采取不同的生产劳动形式。理、工、农、医各专业除经常生产一部分产品外，还应结合国家建设需要，应用新技术试制新产品；社会科学各专业应以较多时间下厂下乡参加生产劳动，并且应结合生产劳动参加社会工作和进行调查研究。
    党的教育方针，要求教育与生产劳动相结合，也就是要进一步贯彻理论和实际相结合的原则。理论和实际相结合，必将提高原有的理论，发展新的理论，从而去指导实践，推动科学研究的开展。而科学研究的开展，又使得教学质量不断提高，并以新的成果来丰富教学内容，推动生产上的技术革命。自然界与人类的奥秘，正在不断地被揭示出来，科学在飞跃发展。如果说，高等学校教学工作过去曾经是满足于传授既成的科学结论的话，那么，在贯彻执行党的教育方针的过程中，就必须不断地在教材中补充最新的科学成就，并引导学生在实践中，对生产战线上和社会变革中的新问题找科学的解答。同时，高等学校进行科学研究，既要培养新的一代，又要直接服务于国家生产建设或国防建设。所以，有的高等学校在进行科学研究时，既注意完成国家分配的任务，又照顾到教学工作的要求。学生结合生产劳动进行科学研究工作，一般地不长期固定，而根据他们的学习内容，在不同时期分配他们参加不同方面、不同性质的工作。这就使学生得到了较为全面的训练，而有利于更好地掌握理论。
    以教学为中心，结合生产劳动和科学研究，就必须把教学、生产劳动、科学研究三者作全面安排。既要重视生产劳动，也要重视课堂教学；既要实践，又要读书。只读书不劳动是片面的，只劳动不读书也是片面的。一面实践，一面读书，才能培养出既有社会主义觉悟、又有文化知识的又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。全面安排教学、生产劳动和科学研究是很细致很复杂的工作。在全面安排中，要把不同系科的全部课程、全部生产劳动任务、全部科学研究任务，分别按课程的性质和不同的年级，统筹兼顾。有的高等学校对于教学、生产劳动和科学研究的安排，要求十分细致。例如，各系和各专业都要从本单位的性质和培养目标出发，考虑安排的途径和方式，自然科学和人文科学有所不同。又如，应根据不同的课程的性质合理安排，基础课、专业课、专门化课有所不同，自然科学中实验性较强的课同理论性较强的课有所不同。再如，不同年级、不同的劳动锻炼情况和知识水平，也要作不同的安排。如果能这样深入细致地安排，教学、生产劳动和科学研究，就必然能够恰到好处。如果不分别不同的具体情况，把复杂的事物简单化，必然不能收到最好的效果。安排问题，还不仅是个时间问题，如果只从时间上来考虑，那只会把三者混合起来，而不是结合起来。我们应该在安排中，既要注意时间的安排，更要注意内容的有机结合，以便相辅相成，互相提高，以有限的时间，获得更多的成就。时间的全面安排和内容的有机结合是统一的，全面安排是为了更好地结合，而只有把三者有机地从内容上结合起来，才能做到时间上的全面安排。
    我们相信，在党的统一领导下，发动群众，经过教师、学生的共同努力，一定会把教学、生产劳动、科学研究密切结合，会把党的教育方针坚持地彻底地贯彻下去。
