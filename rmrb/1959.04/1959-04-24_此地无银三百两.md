　　Burying 300 Taels of Silver Here
　　After the fabricated nature of the so-called "Dalai Lama Statement" was exposed, some Indian officials seemed to sense their awkward situation and quickly stepped forward to deny it, attempting to cover it up in every possible way. However, these denials only led to new confusion and loopholes, becoming more and more muddled with each explanation.
　　Let us look at the facts.
　　According to a Reuters dispatch from Mussoorie on the 21st, citing an anonymous Indian official in Mussoorie with the Dalai Lama's entourage, "The Dalai Lama, with the assistance of his advisors, personally prepared this statement," and "the statement was translated into English by Tibetan officials."
　　However, Menon, the special envoy sent by Indian Prime Minister Nehru to welcome the Dalai Lama, offered a different account. On the 22nd, immediately after the release of the so-called Dalai Lama's second statement, he hosted reporters and told them: "There is no doubt that the statement was written by the Dalai Lama, and the statement was translated by the Tibetans themselves. No one else can be held responsible for this statement." But the so-called Dalai Lama's second statement, released just before Menon's remarks at the same location, stated: "The earlier statement was issued under my authorization."
　　The question arises: Was the so-called Dalai Lama statement written by someone else or by himself? Was it authorized by his so-called "advisors" or by himself, authorizing himself to write and authorize its release?
　　The more fundamental question is: Why didn't Menon dare to address the arguments raised in the Xinhua News Agency political reporter's commentary on April 20th in his vehement denials?
　　Clearly, his clumsy denial failed to convince even the Western reporters in Mussoorie. Reporters questioned him: Why is the so-called "Dalai Lama Statement" written in the third person? Menon replied that the third person "may be a traditional Tibetan form." However, after telling this lie, he obviously felt that it was too self-deceiving, so he immediately retreated, saying: "This is entirely a matter for the Dalai Lama to explain." Reporters then asked him why the so-called Dalai Lama's second statement was uniformly changed to the first person. This experienced Indian diplomat gave a ridiculous answer: "Because Xinhua News Agency hoped that the Dalai Lama would issue a statement in the first person, therefore this statement was issued in the first person."
　　According to Tibetan custom, according to the Dalai Lama's supreme status as a Buddha King, he has always used the first person in his past statements. Why was the first statement issued in his name in India in the third person? Why, after the trickery of the so-called "Dalai Lama Statement" was exposed, was a statement quickly issued in the first person to conform to Xinhua's "hopes"?
　　These questions cannot be answered by Menon. His cover-ups and denials cannot help but remind people of the Chinese story of "burying three hundred taels of silver here."

    此地无银三百两
    在所谓“达赖喇嘛声明”的伪造性质被识破以后，某些印度官员似乎感到了自己尴尬的处境，连忙挺身出来否认，百般掩饰。但是，这些否认只是引起了新的混乱和漏洞，愈讲愈糊涂。
    让我们且看看事实。
    据路透社穆索里21日电援引在穆索里同达赖喇嘛一行在一起的一个匿名的印度官员说，“达赖喇嘛在他的顾问的协助下，亲自准备了这项声明”，“这篇声明是由西藏官员翻译成英文的”。
    可是，印度总理尼赫鲁派往迎接达赖喇嘛的特使梅农又提出了另外一种说法。他在22日在所谓达赖喇嘛的第二个声明发表以后，立即招待记者，并且向他们说：“毫无疑问，声明是达赖喇嘛写的，声明是西藏人自己翻译的，其他人不能对这个声明负责。”但是，就在梅农讲话之前刚刚在同一个地方发表的所谓达赖喇嘛的第二个声明则又说：“早些时候的这篇声明是在我的授权下发表的。”
    问题产生了：所谓达赖喇嘛声明倒底别人代写的，还是他自己亲自写的？是他授权所谓“顾问”们发表的，还是他自己授权自己写的，自己授权自己发表的？
    更根本的问题是：梅农在他的矢口否认中，对新华社政治记者在4月20日评论中所提出的论据，为什么不敢置一词呢？
    显然，他这种不高明的否认，连在穆索里的西方记者也未被说服。记者追问他：为什么所谓“达赖喇嘛声明”用的是第三人称呢？梅农回答说，第三人称“可能是传统的西藏形式”。可是，他在撒了这个谎以后，显然觉得这是过于自欺欺人了，所以，他马上又退回来，说：“这完全是要由达赖喇嘛来解释的事”。记者又问他，为什么所谓达赖喇嘛的第二个声明又一律改用第一人称？这位有经验的印度外交家作了一个令人喷饭的答复：“因为新华通讯社希望达赖发表第一人称的声明，因此这次声明是以第一人称发表的”。
    按照西藏习惯，按照达赖喇嘛作为佛王的至高无上的地位，他过去发表声明一向总是用第一人称的，而为什么在印度以他名义发表的第一次声明用了第三人称呢？为什么在所谓“达赖喇嘛声明”的西洋镜被揭穿以后，又连忙要发表一个符合新华社“希望”的第一人称声明呢？
    这些问题不可能从梅农的口中得到解答。他的掩饰和否认，不禁令人想起了中国“此地无银三百两”的故事来。
