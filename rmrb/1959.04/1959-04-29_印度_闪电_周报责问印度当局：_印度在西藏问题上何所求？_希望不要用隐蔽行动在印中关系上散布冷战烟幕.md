Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 27th – The "Blitz" weekly published an article on the 11th, presenting a view on the question of India's "interests" in Tibet.

The article said that in India's "newspapers and public speeches, there is a lot of nonsense about the fate of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan way of life. No government or Congress Party leader has felt it necessary to tell the country frankly and tell us: What interests does India have in Tibet?"

The article asked, what does India want on the Tibet issue? It said that India's cultural and commercial relations with Tibet have not been jeopardized, and in the Tibetan rebellion, some Indians have taken political sides, while India even today recognizes China's sovereignty over Tibet. It said, "It must be pointed out that the side we are expressing sympathy for is representative of a medieval, feudal, corrupt system. Why? Why is there this new change?"

It said: "Here is an answer without that set of empty diplomatic words: Delhi hopes that Tibet must continue to serve as a buffer zone between Communist China and non-Communist India – if not a buffer state. That is the meaning of the 'strong demand' that Tibet's autonomy should not be hindered.

"In other words, the ancient Lama theocracy should not be replaced by China's political and economic life system – Communism. India and China must not be adjacent; this Himalayan plateau must be placed between them."

It also said, "From Tibet to Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim, the breeze keeps blowing forward. The communist breeze will blow to these Indian 'protectorates' much faster than anything else. India cannot risk the Asian communist giant standing on its actual border. Let Tibet serve as a quarantine line!" It asked: "Does India need a zone of friendly countries surrounding it, including Tibet? Is this our real interest in the Tibet issue?"

The article demanded answers from the Indian government and the Congress Party. It said, do not let the ghost of "secret diplomacy" spread confusion and a Cold War smokescreen in Sino-Indian relations with silent words and covert actions.

The article also reviewed the history of Indian and Tibetan relations. It said that going back to the time of the Mughal conquest of India, India had close cultural and commercial ties with Tibet. But politically, Tibet was considered part of China, especially after the rule of the Mongol Khans, it was part of the Chinese Empire.

The article said that in the early 20th century, British forces established contact with the Lamas and invaded with their support and acquiescence. When necessary, Britain also sent Indian troops.

The article pointed out that after India's independence, India had a special position in Tibet, Indian troops, Indian private transportation lines, and special trade rights. In October 1951, when the Chinese army began to enter Tibet, India took action first. Although India recognized China's sovereignty over Tibet, it gave China a strongly worded note protesting China's military action in Tibet. China also replied in equally strong language, saying that it was determined to liberate Tibet. India replied that it did not wish to interfere in China's internal affairs, but hoped that the problem between China and Tibet could be resolved peacefully.

The article said that the then Indian Ambassador to China, Pannikar, once wrote about this period: "I had anticipated that a malicious propaganda campaign against India would appear in the (Chinese) newspapers. But for some reason, the Chinese, apart from publishing the letters exchanged, toned down the entire issue. The press rarely talked about the dispute. But things were not so easy on our side. Due to sensational reports by American journalists and the instigation of Taipei agents sending chilling reports from Hong Kong, the Indian press continued to talk about Chinese aggression. Even Sardar Patel (then Deputy Prime Minister of India) felt it necessary to give unfriendly speeches. The Ministry of External Affairs also expressed some support for the view that India should take strong action to protect Tibet…"

The article said that the problem was resolved peacefully. China recognized the legitimacy of India's cultural and commercial interests, but the old imperial political institutions in Lhasa were abolished, replaced by the establishment of a consulate-general; China was also to establish similar offices in Mumbai. This was formally agreed in the famous treaty signed between India and China, the preamble of which included the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

### 印度“闪电”周报责问印度当局：  印度在西藏问题上何所求？  希望不要用隐蔽行动在印中关系上散布冷战烟幕

    印度“闪电”周报责问印度当局：
    印度在西藏问题上何所求？
    希望不要用隐蔽行动在印中关系上散布冷战烟幕
    新华社新德里27日电　“闪电”周报在11日刊载了一篇文章，就印度在西藏的“利害关系”问题提出了一种看法。
    文章说，在印度的“报纸上和公开的演说中，有许多关于达赖喇嘛的命运和西藏的生活方式等问题的胡说八道的话。没有一个政府的或者国大党的领袖感到有必要向全国讲心里话和告诉我们：印度在西藏有什么利害关系？”
    文章问道，在西藏问题上，印度要的是什么呢？它说，印度和西藏的文化和商业关系并没有受到危害，而在西藏叛乱事件中，一些印度人在政治方面有了偏袒，而中国人对西藏的主权印度甚至在今天也是承认的。它说，“必须指出，我们所表示同情的一方是中世纪封建腐朽制度的代表。为什么？为什么会有这种新的变化？”
    它说：“这里是一个没有那套空洞的外交词令的答复：德里希望西藏必须继续充当共产党中国和非共产党印度之间的缓冲地区——如果不说是一个缓冲国的话。这就是关于西藏的自治不应当受到妨碍这种‘强烈的要求’的意义。
    “换句话说，不可以用中国的政治和经济生活制度——共产主义——来代替古老的喇嘛神权政体。印中两国一定不要接壤，在它们中间必须放进这块喜马拉雅高原。”
    它又说，“从西藏到尼泊尔、不丹和锡金，微风一直向前吹。共产主义的微风将比任何其他东西快得多地吹到这些印度的‘保护国’。印度不能冒险让亚洲共产主义巨人站在它的实际的边界上。让西藏充当防疫线吧！”它问道：“印度需要一个包括西藏在内的围绕着它的友好国家的地带。这是我们在西藏问题上真正的利害关系吗？”
    文章要求印度政府和国大党作出答复。它说，不要让“秘密外交”的幽灵用无声的言论和隐蔽的行动在印中关系上散布混乱和冷战的烟幕吧。
    文章还回述了印度和西藏关系的历史。它说，上溯到莫卧儿人征服印度的时候为止，印度同西藏有着紧密的文化和商业联系。但是在政治上，西藏被认为是中国的一部分，特别是在蒙古可汗的统治以后，它是中国帝国的一部分。
    文章说，在二十世纪初叶英国势力同喇嘛们建立了接触，并且在他们的支持和默许下入侵。在有必要的时候，英国还曾经派出了印度军队。
    文章指出，在印度独立以后，印度在西藏有着特别的地位、印度军队、印度私人的交通线和特殊的贸易权。在1951年10月，当中国军队开始进入西藏的时候，印度首先采取了行动。印度虽然承认中国对西藏的主权，它给中国措词激烈的照会，抗议中国人在西藏的军事行动。中国也以同样激烈的语言答复说，它决心解放西藏。印度回答说，它不希望干涉中国的内政，但是盼望中国和西藏之间的问题得以和平解决。
    文章说，当时的印度驻华大使潘尼迦曾经就这段时期写道：“我曾预料在（中国的）报章上将出现反对印度的恶意的宣传运动。但是由于某种原因，中国人除了发表了往来的书信以外，压低了整个问题的调子。报刊上很少谈到这次争论。但是在我们这边，事情没有那么轻松。由于美国记者的耸人听闻的报道以及台北的代理人从香港发出的令人毛骨耸然的报道的煽动，印度的报刊继续谈论着中国的侵略。甚至萨达尔·巴特尔（当时印度副总理）觉得有必要发表不友好的演说。外交部对于印度应当采取有力的行动来保护西藏的意见也表示某种支持……。”
    文章说，问题得到了和平的解决，中国承认印度的文化和商业利益的合法性，但是在拉萨的旧的帝国政治机构被废除了，代替它的是要设立总领事馆；中国也要在孟买设立类似的办事处。这是在印度和中国签订的著名条约中所正式同意的，这个条约的序文中包括有和平共处五项原则。
