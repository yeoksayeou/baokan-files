Applying the "Eight-Character Constitution" Appropriately
Jiangyin and Weinan Chengguan Commune Adopt Measures for High Yields Based on Local Conditions

(People's Daily Jiangyin, April 18th) Reporter Xu Wen, Gu Ping commentary: Correctly implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture is a guarantee for developing production; production practice constantly enriches the content of the "Eight-Character Constitution." Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, which won the title of the province's highest grain yield county in 1958, has absorbed the experience of achieving high yields last year by implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution." This year's rice yield increase measures are more detailed and solid. When formulating various rice measures, the county first seriously summarized last year's rice production experience from bottom to top. Many successful or failed practical experiences have become the basis for formulating each measure this year, making this year's measures more thorough and practical. According to the characteristics of Jiangyin's strong seasonality in planting mid-season rice, this year, it is grasping "five earlies" from the beginning, namely, early sowing, early transplanting, early processing, early topdressing, and early draining. Various preparatory work has been advanced by a month compared to last year. This can not only promote early tillering, early thickening, early heading, and early maturity of mid-season rice but also avoid the peak period of rice stem borers. At the same time, due to the robust development in the early stage, it can prevent lodging in the later stage.

In terms of fertilization, according to numerous yield increase examples last year, after deep plowing and close planting, the amount of fertilizer applied is directly proportional to the yield increase. The quantity and quality of fertilizer in Jiangyin County this year have been improved compared to last year, and emphasis is placed on applying base fertilizer and strengthening rational topdressing. This year, in terms of fertilization methods, Jiangyin County proposed to first apply sufficient base fertilizer, and to combine refined and coarse fertilizers, as well as quick-acting and slow-acting fertilizers, to achieve quick results above and slow results below, with fertilizer in every layer. According to these requirements, the amount and quality of fertilizer accumulated are higher than last year. The grass pond mud, which is the main base fertilizer for rice, is generally "four combinations" and "three turnings." In the past, it was a combination of river mud, rice straw, and green manure. This year, 50 dan of pig manure per mu is added to the pond for fermentation, becoming a four-way combination. Some production teams also add appropriate amounts of superphosphate or bone meal. In the past, grass pond mud was turned twice before application, but this year it is turned three times. This can accelerate the decomposition of various substances in the grass mud pond, making nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium complete, and combining quick-acting and slow-acting fertilizers, which can promote rapid reviving and greening of rice, early thickening, and early tillering.

In terms of rational close planting, Jiangyin County generally had 32,000 holes per mu last year, with an average of more than 230,000 total ears. Many high-yield models have a density of more than 40,000 holes. This year, Jiangyin County will adopt a more rational density based on last year's yield increase experience. In terms of seedling arrangement, Jiangyin County also absorbed last year's successful experience and generally promoted strip planting, which is conducive to ventilation and light transmission, increasing sunshine, reducing humidity between plants, and promoting healthy and balanced rice growth.

Along with close planting, deep plowing, and sufficient fertilizer, a series of new measures will be taken this year to strengthen field management. It is required to rationally supply water, improve ventilation and light transmission conditions, regulate soil and water temperature, and promote fertilizer decomposition. At the same time, strengthen water management according to the different characteristics of low-lying fields, leaky fields, and over-fertilized vigorous rice fields. Generally, adopt the method of shallow irrigation and frequent irrigation, shallow first and then full after transplanting, deep first and then shallow during the heading and flowering period, heavy drainage in the middle, and dry and wet in the later stage to promote early development, early maturity, and ensure thick stalks, multiple ears, and full grains. Careful planning for the use of labor is an important guarantee for the comprehensive and smooth implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution." Last year, Jiangyin County encountered a drought unseen in a century during the transplanting season. Because there was not enough labor to irrigate, some high fields were delayed for ten days, affecting the yield. This year, the county has learned from last year's experience and has made comprehensive early plans and clever arrangements to ensure that no time is wasted.

(People's Daily Xi'an, April 18th) Shuangwang Production Brigade of Chengguan People's Commune, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, appropriately implements the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture.

Since last year, according to the requirements of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, the team has first conducted experiments on some measures conceived for increasing production in the experimental farm, and then promoted them to the large fields after success. For example, in order to solve the problems of corn planting density, how to keep up with water and fertilizer after close planting, how to ventilate and transmit light, and facilitate field management, experiments were conducted on wide and narrow rows of corn and shallow furrow planting. As a result, while the number of plants increased from more than 3,000 to more than 4,000, good ventilation and light transmission conditions were still maintained, and it was also convenient for soil cultivation and field management. It can also concentrate fertilization to implement scientific infiltration irrigation. As a result, the yield of stubble corn reached more than 9,000 jin per mu. This year, the entire team will generally promote this experience in irrigated cotton and corn fields.

Observing the weather, the land, and the crops, and flexibly applying various experiences are also another important feature of the team's specific implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. Last year, Zhang Qiuxiang's three irrigations and three non-irrigations (i.e., irrigate on sunny days but not on cloudy days, irrigate when there is no wind but not when there is wind, irrigate when there is no rain but not when there is rain) in cotton field irrigation avoided causing sudden changes in soil temperature and affecting crop growth. This experience has been widely promoted this year. More importantly, the spirit of flexibly implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" according to different conditions has been grasped by everyone. For example, in this year's wheat irrigation and fertilization, it is carried out according to the different conditions of moisture and fertilizer in the soil and the needs of the crops. Some have been winter irrigated, the soil has more moisture, and more nitrogen fertilizer has been applied in the past. Wheat also needs to be stunted to prevent sudden growth. They will not irrigate or irrigate less, while increasing the proportion of ash and potash fertilizer in topdressing; if the wheat is yellow and needs nitrogen fertilizer, apply human manure and urine appropriately and irrigate. In this way, the wheat grows very steadily and is very neat, without sudden growth or unevenness.

When encountering important issues in the specific implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution," the brigade will always convene old farmers, labor models, technical cadres, etc. to discuss them together. This facilitates the connection of various opinions, makes full research, and finds specific and reliable solutions. Last year, before wheat sowing, when discussing the amount of sowing for wheat close planting, some people initially only calculated the area of one mu and the space occupied by wheat stalks and ears, and proposed too high an amount of close planting sowing. Some people proposed that the area occupied by wheat roots should also be calculated. After careful research, various different sowing amounts were determined according to different conditions.

　　运用“八字宪法”要恰到好处
　　江阴和渭南城关公社因地制宜采取丰产措施
    本报江阴18日电　记者徐文、古平评述：正确贯彻农业生产的八字宪法，是发展生产的保证；生产的实践又不断充实了八字宪法的内容。江苏省1958年荣获全省粮食产量冠军县的江阴县，吸取去年执行八字宪法获得丰产的经验，今年的水稻增产措施更加细致、扎实。这个县在制订水稻的各项措施时，首先从下而上地认真总结了去年水稻的生产经验，许多成功或失败的实践经验，成为今年制订每一项措施的依据，使今年的措施更加周密和切实。根据江阴种植中稻季节性较强的特点，今年从头抓紧“五早”，即早播种，早移栽，早加工，早追肥，早搁田。各项准备工作比去年提早了一个月。这样不但可以促使中稻早发棵，早长粗，早抽穗，早成熟，而且可以避过螟虫盛发期，同时，由于前期发育粗壮，可以防止后期倒伏。
    在施肥方面，根据去年无数的增产实例证明，深耕密植后，施肥量与产量成正比例上升。江阴县今年的肥料数量和质量都比去年有所提高，而且着重施基肥，强调合理追肥。今年在施肥方法上，江阴县提出首先要施足基肥，而且要精粗肥搭配，迟速效肥兼备，做到上速下迟，层层有肥。根据这些要求，目前积肥中在数量和质量上都比去年要求更高。作为水稻主要基肥的草塘泥普遍做到“四搭配”“三翻身”。过去是河泥、稻草、绿肥三搭配，今年每亩加五十担猪灰放在塘里一起沤，成为四搭配，有些生产队还放进适量的过磷酸钙或骨粉。过去草塘泥施用前翻两次，今年翻三次。这样就能加快草泥塘中各种物质的腐熟，可使氮磷钾俱全，迟速效肥兼备，可以促使水稻迅速活棵返青，早长粗，早发棵。
    在合理密植方面，江阴县去年普遍是每亩三万二千穴，总穗数平均在二十三万棵以上。许多高产典型，密植程度都在四万穴以上。今年江阴县根据去年增产的经验，将采取更合理的密度。在莳秧展式上，江阴县也吸取了去年的成功经验，普遍推行条莳，这样有利于通风透光，增加日照，可以降低棵间湿度，促使水稻生长健壮均衡。
    随着密植、深耕、足肥的情况，在加强田间管理上，今年将采取一系列新的措施。要求合理供给水分，改善通风透光的条件，调节地温和水温，促进肥料分解。同时，分别低洼田、漏水田和过肥的旺稻田的不同特性，加强水浆管理。一般掌握浅水勤灌，栽秧后先浅后满，孕穗开花期，先深后浅，中间重搁，后期干干湿湿的方法，以促进早发、早熟，保证秆粗穗多粒饱。周密计划使用劳力，是全面地顺利地贯彻八字宪法的重要保证。江阴县去年在栽秧期间，碰到百年未有的大旱，因为劳力来不及灌水，有些高田延迟了十天栽插，影响了产量。今年这个县吸取了去年的经验，全面地进行了早打算和巧安排，保证不误农时。
    本报西安18日电　陕西渭南县城关人民公社双王生产大队，恰到好处地贯彻执行农业八字宪法。
    从去年以来，这个队根据农业八字宪法的要求，把一些为增产所设想的措施，先在试验农场进行试验，成功以后再向大田推广。例如为了解决玉米密植程度及密植后水肥如何跟上、如何通风透光和便利田间管理等问题，作了玉米宽窄行、开沟浅种的试验，结果在株数由三千多增加到四千多的情况下，仍然保持了良好的通风透光条件，也便于培土和田间管理，还能集中施肥实行科学的渗透灌溉，结果回茬玉米亩产达到九千多斤。今年全队要在水地棉花和玉米中普遍推广这个经验。
    看天、看地、看庄稼，灵活运用各种经验，也是这个队具体执行农业八字宪法的另一个重要特点。去年张秋香在棉田灌溉中创造的三灌三不灌（即天阴不灌天晴灌、有风不灌无风灌、有雨不灌无雨灌），避免了引起地温突变而影响作物生长，这个经验今年普遍推广了。更重要的是这种根据不同条件灵活执行八字宪法的精神已为大家所掌握。如今年在进行小麦灌溉、施肥中，都是根据土壤中水分、肥料的不同情况和作物需要来进行，有的冬灌过，土壤水分较多，过去上的氮肥也多，小麦又需要蹲苗防止陡长，他们就不灌或少灌，同时增加追肥中草木灰和磷钾肥的比重；有的小麦发黄需要氮肥，就适当上人粪尿，灌水。这样小麦生长的很稳，非常整齐，没有陡长和参差不齐的现象。
    这个大队在遇到具体执行八字宪法中的重要问题时，总要召集老农、劳动模范、技术干部等共同讨论，这样就便于把各方面的见解联系起来，作充分的研究，找到具体可靠的办法。去年小麦播种前讨论关于小麦密植的播种量时，开始有人只计算一亩的面积和小麦秆茎和麦穗所占的空间，提出过高的密植播种量，有的人就提出还要计算麦根所占的面积，经过仔细地研究，根据不同条件确定了各种不同的播种量。（吴钢）
