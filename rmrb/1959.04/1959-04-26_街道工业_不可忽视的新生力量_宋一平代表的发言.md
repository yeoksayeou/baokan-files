Street Industry – A Neglected Emerging Force
Speech by Delegate Song Yiping

Fellow Delegates:

I fully agree with the "Government Work Report" made by Premier Zhou, and the reports made by Deputy Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I would like to express some opinions on the issue of street-run industries in Wuhan.

**Small Enterprises Run by Street Residents Are a Component of Urban Industry**

The people of Wuhan are heroically marching towards the goal of building a strong socialist industrial base, and the face of Wuhan is changing with each passing day. During the Second Five-Year Plan, we will focus on key national construction projects such as the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, Wuhan Boiler Plant, Casting and Forging Center Plant, Shipyard, Turbine and Turbo Generator Plant, and Comprehensive Motor Plant to gradually establish a strong foundation for basic industries such as steel and machinery. We will also strive to develop towards the production of advanced, precision, large-scale, and complete sets of products. At the same time, we will correspondingly drive and promote the development of power industry, chemical industry, light industry, transportation and construction industries, so as to initially form a relatively complete industrial system around the key national industries. In socialist industrial construction, we have firmly implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of simultaneously developing large and small enterprises, and simultaneously using both foreign and indigenous methods of production, thereby greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres at all levels and the broad masses of people. Especially after the Central Committee issued the call for "the whole people to run industry," Wuhan City, while launching a high tide of supporting and ensuring key construction projects, has seen the emergence of an emerging force that cannot be ignored, that is, the small enterprises collectively run by urban street residents are blooming everywhere, becoming an indispensable component in the development of urban industry. According to a survey, in May 1958, there were about 113 street factories in the city, with 3,217 employees; after two or three months of development, there were more than 2,700 factories and groups, with more than 38,000 employees; in November, based on the principle of facilitating production and convenience for the masses, a preliminary adjustment and merger was carried out. By February of this year, the city had formed 1,260 various types of standardized factories, with 38,730 employees (excluding more than 18,000 employees in service industries and temporary workers). The total output value produced by these factories in 1958 was more than 37 million yuan, and in the first quarter of this year alone, it reached more than 34 million yuan. The product variety reached more than 1,800 kinds. Many of these factories were empty at the beginning of their establishment. Thanks to the leadership and support of the Party, and the high enthusiasm of the broad masses of residents, they worked hard, practically, and skillfully, raised funds themselves, solved the difficulties of factory buildings, production tools, and raw materials themselves, and sought out technical forces themselves (such as finding retired old workers as masters, and finding family members or relatives working in large factories to impart technology). They built factories one by one in a simple, localized, timely, and personalized manner, diligently and frugally. The establishment of street industries has also received great support from the state. For example, in the total investment of 2,449,000 yuan, in addition to the 978,000 yuan invested by the masses (including 510,000 yuan in cash and 468,000 yuan in production materials priced), the government allocated 381,000 yuan and the bank loaned 1,090,000 yuan, totaling 1,471,000 yuan, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total investment. In addition, state-owned large factories have also given great help to street factories. They allocated some old equipment, waste materials, and scraps to support the construction of street factories, and provided technical guidance and training. This kind of cooperation between large and small factories, with large factories leading small factories, is an important method for developing local small industries. Now street industries have taken shape and have shown their positive role in many aspects.

**Supporting Industrial and Agricultural Production and Construction, Providing Daily Necessities for the City**

First, it supported industrial and agricultural production and construction. Among the street factories in Wuhan, there are 284 small machinery manufacturing, machinery repair, and small hardware factories, most of which are directly linked to large factories for cooperation, processing and producing various small parts for large factories. For example, the Baoshan Street Foundry processed and cast 198 tons of castings for Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant and Wuhan Blower Factory in half a year. The Minglun Street Foundry casts more than 30 tons of parts such as motor housings for Wuchang Shipyard every month (the highest monthly output reached more than 60 tons). In this way, the street small factories played the role of satellite factories for large factories, enabling large factories to concentrate their equipment and superior technical forces to develop towards advanced, precision, and large-scale products.

Many street factories have repaired and manufactured a large number of small industrial machinery and equipment for rural people's communes. For example, the Tongyi Street Boiler Factory manufactured six sluice gates for Honghu and other counties. The Chezhan Street Storage Battery Internal Combustion Engine Factory repaired 64 water pumps, tractors, and automobile internal combustion engines for 24 counties in Henan and Hubei in February and March this year. Many factories have manufactured various pesticides, veterinary drugs, and chemical fertilizers, and some of these products have even been sold to several provinces. Many factories have signed long-term mechanical repair and processing contracts with surrounding counties. All of these have timely and powerfully supported agricultural production.

Second, it provided a variety of daily necessities for the market. More than half of the street factories produce means of livelihood. They provide a large number of small commodities indispensable to people's lives. Such as knives, garter belts, pen nibs, sewing needles, locks, cotton children's clothing, safety pins, buttons, etc., which are really colorful and diverse. And they also undertake various repair needs of the people. All of these are currently beyond the capacity of large factories to replace and cannot be taken care of. Especially when the original local state-owned factories and handicraft cooperatives that produced the above-mentioned various means of livelihood have mostly switched to producing means of production in the Great Leap Forward, the role played by the newly developed street small factories in this regard is even more important.

**Eradicating Unemployment, Giving Play to the Talents of Housewives**

Third, street industry facilitates the use of various kinds of labor. Because street industry has a wide variety of products, small and fragmented parts, simple equipment, flexible production, and does not require large factories, many products can be produced in households. Therefore, they do not need a lot of full labor, and can make full use of women, the elderly, the weak, and other semi-labor. Anyone who has not completely lost the ability to work can participate in different productions according to their own conditions and undertake the work they can do. For example, among the 38,730 employees in street factories, there are: 17,967 women, accounting for 46.39 percent of the total number of employees, and some factories are as high as 70 to 80 percent; 9,230 elderly, weak, and disabled people (including some retirees), accounting for 23.8 percent of the total number of employees; 1,042 blind, deaf, and mute people, accounting for 2.69 percent of the total number of employees. These people are difficult or impossible to find employment in large factories, but now they have found employment opportunities. Our society has not only eradicated unemployment, but also created employment conditions for those who cannot find employment under normal circumstances, especially facilitating the employment of many housewives, which is of great social significance. After these people participated in the production of street factories, they quickly learned a production technology, which is equivalent to cultivating a new batch of technical forces for the country. Taking Zhan Shuquan and Yang Juzhen, two housewives on Minzhu Road Street, as examples, they overcame many difficulties and learned to extract oxalic acid from sawdust. Many other people have learned business management and political work, and their talents and organizational skills have quickly been brought into play, becoming a backbone force in street factories. After the vast number of residents participated in factory production, they have increased their income and improved their lives. Many of the past difficult households who needed government relief are now mostly not only not needing relief, but their lives have improved instead. And the state has therefore saved a large amount of relief funds. Moreover, street industry has further supported the establishment of various collective welfare undertakings. Now, all the streets in the city have extracted a certain amount of funds from the profits of street industry to run 988 nurseries and kindergartens, 25 homes for the elderly, 602 canteens, and many other public service undertakings such as laundry, hairdressing, and bathing. The establishment of these undertakings has been warmly welcomed by the vast number of housewives and street residents, enabling them to get rid of the burden of trivial housework and join the ranks of socialist construction and street industrial labor without worries.

**Using Urban Waste and Old Materials to Create Wealth for Society**

Fourth, it fully utilized urban waste, old materials, garbage and sewage, etc., turning useless into useful and creating wealth for society. Many street factories have taken the garbage and cinder removed from large factories and washed out a large number of various metal raw materials. In the second half of last year alone, a "waste washing and processing group" of 18 people (now developed to 35 people) on Dacheng Road Street washed out 3,475 catties of copper, 129 catties of blue lead, 11 catties of miscellaneous aluminum, 74,764 catties of ferrous metal, and 36,725 catties of miscellaneous items. The Wuhan Electrolytic Salt Plant lacked thousands of catties of copper and could not start up, and it was successfully installed and put into production ahead of schedule by using this kind of copper. In addition, such as using rice husks plus sulfuric acid to make widely used chemical raw materials such as methanol, phenolic oil, furfural, asphalt, and special medicines for treating lung diseases after distillation and heating, using bleaching powder residue discarded by printing and dyeing factories to make a large amount of calcium carbonate, using waste cotton to spin yarn and weave cloth, and using human urine to make ammonia water, and so on. All of this has supplemented the raw materials for industry and played a certain role in supporting national construction.

**Changing People's Spiritual Outlook, Scattered Petty Citizens Become Organized Labor Army**

Fifth, in the collective labor and collective life of street factories, people's spiritual outlook has also undergone great changes. Yesterday, they were women scattered in housework and scattered petty citizens, but today, after participating in production, they have become an organized labor army. Their loose, conservative, narrow, and selfish old habits will be replaced by an increasingly strengthened labor outlook and collectivist spirit. Especially for the transformation of independent laborers, we believe that street industry is a very good form. After organizing them into street factories, on the one hand, they can bring their technical role into play; on the other hand, through collective production, it is easier to educate them and completely eliminate the possibility of them taking the capitalist road. In addition, those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who were scattered in society and removed by state organs, enterprises, and schools, and some idlers who were left over from the old society who have not been thoroughly reformed, are all absorbed into street factories, which can not only enable them to create wealth for society, but also facilitate the masses to supervise and educate them and accelerate their transformation.

In short, the role of street residents in running industry is very significant. As soon as this new seedling appeared, it showed its strong vitality, fully proving the correctness of the Party Central Committee's policy of "walking on two legs" of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises and simultaneously using both foreign and indigenous methods of production. Any neglect of street small industry, letting it develop blindly and freely, and not actively leading and managing it, is wrong. Those who think that street small factories are too scattered and difficult to manage, or who do not consider the various needs of society and blindly merge into large factories, or take negative restrictions, are also wrong. As Premier Zhou pointed out in the "Government Work Report": "Small enterprises on the industrial front and mass movements of indigenous production should continue to be carried out and gradually improved. ... Never underestimate their role, underestimating them will lead to mistakes." Therefore, in order to better play the active role of street industry and its potential, it is very necessary to further rectify, consolidate, and improve street industry, strengthen the Party's leadership and management of street industry, and timely solve the existing problems of street industry.

**Street Industry is a Collective Ownership Enterprise, While Possessing Several State-Owned Components**

First of all, the nature, development direction, and road of street industry must be clarified. In the early days of the establishment of street industry in Wuhan, because it was funded by the masses themselves and solved the problems of factory buildings, equipment, raw materials, and technical forces themselves, it initially appeared in the form of collective ownership. However, because of its establishment, it has received the help of the state, the support of large factories, and a series of management measures taken by street Party and government organizations, it simultaneously has several state-owned components, and in the process of development, the tendency of this state-owned component is gradually increasing. At present, it is in the process of transitioning from collective ownership to complete state ownership. This transition will take some time, and the length of this time depends on the level of awareness of the masses in each factory and the development of production, and cannot be generalized.

Adapt to Local Conditions, Time and People, Unified Management and Decentralized Production

As for the production development direction and development road of street industry, in accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" and the principle of combining large, medium, and small industries with a rational division of labor, we should focus on the processing and repair of industrial, agricultural production, and people's lives, and the production of daily necessities. Small-scale independent manufacturing that is within our capacity and does not contradict the production of large-scale industry is also possible. We must always adhere to the gradual development path of adapting to local conditions, adapting to the time, adapting to the people, being simple, from small to large, and from indigenous to foreign. Any practice that deviates from reality, blindly seeks large-scale and foreign-style, is not feasible. At the same time, we should also pay attention to incorporating production, supply, sales, and production management into the national plan as much as possible. In terms of raw material supply, in addition to relying on state-owned large industries and state-owned commercial processing, and the state appropriately allocating a part of raw materials, we must also rely on our own efforts to repeatedly and comprehensively utilize old materials and waste products, and find substitutes. In terms of product sales, in addition to sporadic repair services, we should generally adopt the forms of processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales as much as possible. Product prices should be subject to unified market management. For some products of street industry that have high costs and cannot maintain production if sold entirely at market prices, the commercial department should, from the spirit of supporting and caring for them, consider handling the purchase prices in accordance with the principle of industry earning more, commerce earning less, and not losing or earning, and providing subsidies when necessary. In terms of production management, we should adopt the method of unified management and decentralized production by the street. This is conducive to strengthening planned management, comprehensively utilizing technology and production equipment, and organizing production cooperation, which is beneficial to improving labor productivity.

**Correctly Handle the Distribution of Income, So that the Distribution Ratio of the State, Collective, and Individuals is Reasonable**

Second, the issue of income distribution in street industry. Correctly handling the distribution of income so that the distribution ratio of the state, the collective, and individuals is reasonable is a problem that urgently needs to be solved in the development of street industry. From the principle of supporting the development of street industry, taking care of the needs of street collective welfare undertakings, and ensuring personal income: (1) In terms of taxation, adopt the principle of being lenient and simple. In addition to paying the unified industrial and commercial tax as required, the state's collection of income tax is generally fixed at about 20 percent of the enterprise's profits. In addition, the street extracts about 30 percent from the profits as a fund for running collective welfare undertakings (of which a certain proportion should be maintained for the welfare of factory employees, which is allocated to each factory for use); the enterprise retains about 50 percent for expanding reproduction and investment. After this distribution ratio is determined through consultation with the masses, the street office conducts financial management and supervision, uniformly dispatches funds, and uses them for special purposes. In order to distinguish between primary and secondary and priorities, ensure that collective welfare undertakings are run on the basis of prioritizing the development of production, and achieve planned, overall distribution and reasonable use. (2) The funds and production materials raised by the masses must be gradually repaid from the accumulation. The pricing of some production materials must be carefully and reasonably determined and repaid regularly. (3) In order to ensure the payment of wages during the off-season and when production is abnormal, a certain amount of additional wages can be extracted from the total wages and listed within the cost, approximately setting aside one month's salary for the whole year for reserve. If this reserve fund does not need to be used, it can be used for developing production.

**It is Necessary to Maintain the Necessary Number of Full Labor, Overly High and Low Wages Need to be Adjusted**

Third, the issue of labor wages. The labor force of street industry is generally solved locally. According to the aforementioned situation, it not only uses semi-labor and auxiliary labor, but also uses full labor. In order to ensure the consolidation and improvement of street industry, the labor force should be relatively stable. Last year, nearly 70,000 laborers were transferred from the streets to support large industry and capital construction, and the remaining labor force in the streets is limited, especially the full labor force is not much. In the future, when supporting national construction, we must plan to allocate labor, and pay special attention to maintaining the necessary number of full labor to maintain the production of street factories.

The wage level of street factories is currently such that the average wage is roughly close to that of state-owned factories, but about 10 percent of people have wages that are too high or too low, and the wages of these people need to be adjusted. In the past, there were four forms of wages: monthly salary system, piece-rate system, hourly system (giving one day's wage for one day's work), and distribution system (of which the monthly salary system and piece-rate system were the most common, and the hourly system and distribution system were less common). The first three forms of wages can still be maintained, but the distribution system is worth considering. According to our investigation of six factories and groups using the distribution system, the average wage of production workers is 97.6 yuan, with the highest being 500 yuan and the lowest being 30 yuan. This is obviously unreasonable. For the wage level of the same industry but different streets, because the level of production development is different, differences are allowed, but the gap should not be too large. For some factories that cannot maintain the original wage level due to insufficient work or production losses, a temporary reduction in wages can also be adopted. In short, the solution to the wage problem should be conducive to the consolidation of street factories and the development of production.

Finally, I would also like to talk about the issue of the street management system. With the large number of street industries being established and the decentralization of management power in urban districts, the content of street work is becoming increasingly complex. Therefore, we must study the urban management system well. The content of street work is centered on production, and the scope is very broad. Taking Lijie Street as an example, they manage 69 factories, 359 shops, 25 collective welfare undertakings, and 9 cultural, educational, and health undertakings. In addition, there are also housing management, civil mediation, public security, environmental sanitation, and so on, almost all-encompassing. It is no longer the time when they only managed administrative and political work and residents' lives. The residents under the jurisdiction of the streets are generally 7,000 or 8,000 households, about 30,000 people, and some are nearly 10,000 households, about 50,000 or 60,000 people. Therefore, the leadership at the street level must be greatly strengthened, the management powers between districts and streets should be appropriately adjusted, and it is necessary to consider establishing basic-level political power at the street level. In this way, the leadership of the streets will be both conducive to strengthening centralized and unified leadership, and conducive to contacting the masses and mobilizing and organizing the masses.

The time for Wuhan's street-run industry is still very short, and many problems have not been studied in time. There are still many shortcomings and problems. I am reporting these situations to the conference in the hope of receiving criticism and corrections from all delegates.

    街道工业——不可忽视的新生力量
    宋一平代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理所作“政府工作报告”、和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告。我想就武汉市街道办工业问题发表一点意见。
    街道居民举办的小型企业是城市工业的组成部分
    武汉人民正在英勇地向着建设一个强大的社会主义工业基地的目标迈进，武汉市的面貌正在日新月异地变化着。在第二个五年计划期间，我们将以武钢、武汉重型机床厂、武汉锅炉厂、铸锻中心厂、造船厂、汽轮机与汽轮发电机厂、综合电机厂等国家重点建设项目为中心，逐步地建立起钢铁、机械等基本工业强有力的基础，并且努力向着生产高级、精密、大型、成套产品的方向发展。与此同时，将要相应地带动和促进动力工业、化学工业、轻工业、交通运输业和建筑业等的发展，以便在国家重点工业的周围初步地形成一个比较完整的工业体系。在社会主义工业建设中，我们坚定地执行了党中央所制定的大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针，因而极大地调动了各级干部和广大人民群众的积极性。特别是在中央发出“全民办工业”的号召以后，武汉市在掀起支援和确保重点建设高潮的同时，出现了一支不可忽视的新生力量，这就是城市街道居民集体举办的小型企业遍地开花，成为发展城市工业中不可缺少的一个组成部分。根据调查，在一九五八年五月份的时候，全市街道工厂约有一百一十三个，职工三千二百一十七人；经过两、三个月的时间的发展，就有二千七百多个厂组，职工三万八千多人；在十一月份，从便利生产、便利群众的原则出发，进行了一次初步地调整合并，到今年二月为止，全市已形成了各种定型工厂一千二百六十个，职工三万八千七百三十人（不包括服务性行业和临时工等一万八千多人在内）。这些工厂在一九五八年生产的总产值是三千七百余万元，而今年第一季度就达到到三千四百余万元。产品品种达一千八百多个种类。这些工厂在创办初期，很多是一无所有的，由于党的领导和支持，和广大居民群众发挥了高度的积极性，苦干、实干、巧干，自筹资金，自己解决厂房、生产工具和原材料的困难，自找技术力量（如找退休的老工人当师傅、找在大厂作工的家属或戚友传授技术），因陋就简、因地制宜、因时制宜、因人制宜、克勤克俭地将工厂一个一个地办了起来的。街道工业的建立，同时也得到了国家很大的支援，如投资总额二百四十四万九千元中，除了群众投资九十七万八千元（其中现金为五十一万元，生产资料折价为四十六万八千元）外，政府拨款三十八万一千元，银行贷款一百零九万元，两者共计一百四十七万一千元，占投资总额的百分之六十强。此外，国营大工厂也给予了街道工厂大力的帮助，他们拨出一些陈旧的设备、废料、边料等支援了街道工厂的建设，并且进行了技术上的指导和培训。这种大小厂协作，以大厂带小厂，是发展地方小型工业的一条重要方法。现在街道工业已初具规模，并已在很多方面显示出了它的积极作用。
    支援工农业生产建设，为城市提供日用必需品
    第一，支援了工农业生产建设。武汉市的街道工厂中有二百八十四个小型机械制造、机械修理、小五金工厂，大部分都与大工厂直接挂钩，进行协作，为大厂加工生产各种小型部件，像宝善街铸造厂半年中就为武汉重型机床厂和武汉鼓风机厂等加工铸造了一百九十八吨铸件。明伦街翻砂厂每月为武昌造船厂铸出马达外壳等部件达三十余吨（最高月产量达六十余吨）。这样街道小厂就起了大厂卫星厂的作用，使大厂能够集中自己的设备和优越的技术力量，向高级、精密、大型产品方面发展。
    不少街道工厂为农村人民公社修理和制造了大量的小型工业的机械设备。如统一街锅炉厂即为洪湖等县制造了六部水闸闸门。车站街蓄电池内燃机厂在今年二、三月内即为河南、湖北的二十四个县赶修了抽水机、拖拉机、汽车内燃机六十四部。不少厂制造了各种农药、兽药和化学肥料，这些产品有的甚至远销数省。许多厂都与周围各县签订了长期的机械修理和加工的合同。这些，都及时有力地支援了农业生产。
    第二，为市场提供了多种多样的生活日用必需品。街道工厂中有半数以上是生产生活资料的。它们提供了人民生活中不可缺少的大量的细小商品。如小刀、袜带、笔尖、缝衣针、锁钥、棉毛童装、别针钮扣等等，真是五花八门、多种多样。并且它们还担负了人民群众各种各样的修修补补的需要。所有这一些，都是目前大厂无力代替和无法兼顾的。尤其是当着原有生产上述各种生活资料的地方国营工厂和手工业合作社等在大跃进中大多转业生产生产资料的情形下，新发展起来的街道小工厂在这方面所起的作用就更加显得重要了。
    根绝了失业现象，发挥了家庭妇女的聪明才智
    第三，街道工业便于使用各种各样的劳动力。由于街道工业的产品种类繁多、细小零星、设备简单、生产灵便、不需要大厂房，许多产品可以分散在家庭里生产，因此它们不需要用很多的全劳动力，可以充分利用妇女老弱等半劳动力，凡未完全丧失劳动能力的人，都可以根据自己的条件参加不同的生产，担负自己力所能及的工作。比如街道工厂的三万八千七百三十个职工中，就有：妇女一万七千九百六十七个，占职工总数百分之四十六点三九，有的厂高达百分之七十至八十；老弱残废（包括一些退休人员在内）九千二百三十人，占职工总数百分之二十三点八；盲、聋、哑人一千零四十二人，占职工总数百分之二点六九。这些人是很难或根本无法在大工厂就业的，现在却找到了就业的机会。我们的社会不但根绝了失业现象，而且为那些在一般情况下无法就业的人创造了就业的条件，特别是便利了许多家庭妇女的就业，这是有很大社会意义的。这些人在参加了街道工厂的生产以后，很快地学会了一种生产技术，等于为国家培养了一批新的技术力量。以民主路街的两个家庭妇女詹淑权和杨菊珍为例，她们克服了许多困难，学会了从木屑中提炼草酸。还有许多人学会了经营管理和做政治工作，她们的聪明才智和组织能力，很快地就发挥出来了，成为街道工厂的一支骨干力量。广大居民参加工厂生产以后，都增加了收入，改善了生活，许多过去的困难户需要政府救济的，现在大多数不但不要救济，生活反而改善了。而国家却因此节约了一大笔救济费。并且街道工业还进一步地支持了各种集体福利事业的举办。现在全市各个街道都从街道工业的利润中抽出一定数量的资金举办了托儿所、幼儿园九百八十八个、敬老院二十五个、食堂六百零二个，还有许多其他洗衣、理发、洗澡等公共服务事业。这些事业的举办，受到广大家庭妇女和街道居民群众的热烈欢迎，使他们可以摆脱掉繁琐家务的牵累，无挂无忧地走到社会主义建设和街道工业劳动大军的行列里来。
    利用城市废旧物资，为社会创造财富
    第四，充分地利用了城市的废旧物资和垃圾污水等，变无用为有用，为社会创造了财富。许多街道工厂把从大厂中清除出来的垃圾、煤渣，弄去淘炼出大量的各种金属原料。仅大成路街的一个十八人的（现发展为三十五人）“废品淘洗加工组”在去年下半年的时间内，就淘洗出铜类三千四百七十五斤，青铅一百二十九斤，杂铝十一斤，黑色金属七万四千七百六十四斤，杂品三万六千七百二十五斤。武汉电解食盐厂缺乏铜类千斤，不能上马，就是利用这种铜顺利安装起来，提前投入生产的。此外，如利用砻糠加硫酸经过蒸溜加温后制出甲醇、酚油、糠醛、柏油和治肺病特效药等有着广泛用途的化工原料，利用印染厂抛弃的漂粉渣制出大量的炭酸钙，利用废旧棉絮纺纱织布，利用人尿制出氨水，等等。这一切，都为工业索取了补充原材料，为支援国家建设起了一定的作用。
    改变了人们的精神面貌，散漫的小市民成为有组织的劳动大军
    第五，在街道工厂的集体劳动和集体生活中，人们的精神面貌也起了很大的变化。昨天还是分散在家务劳动中的妇女、散漫的小市民，今天参加生产以后，就变成有组织的劳动大军了。他们涣散、保守、狭隘、自私的旧习气，将由日益加强的劳动观点和集体主义精神所代替。特别是对独劳户的改造，我们认为街道工业是一种很好的形式。把他们组织到街道工厂以后，一方面可以发挥他们技术上的作用；另一方面通过集体生产，更便于对他们进行教育，完全杜绝他们走资本主义道路的可能性。另外，把流散在社会上和被国家机关、企业、学校清除出来的地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子、右派分子，和旧社会遗留下来的未经彻底改造的一些不务正业的游手好闲的分子，都吸收到街道工厂内，既可以使他们为社会创造财富，也更便于群众对他们实行监督教育，加速对他们的改造。
  　总而言之，街道居民办工业的作用是十分显著的。这个新生幼芽一出现，就表现了它的强大的生命力，充分证明了党中央提出的大中小型企业并举、洋法生产与土法生产并举的“两条腿走路”的方针的正确性。任何忽视街道小工业，听其放任自流盲目发展，不积极去加以领导和管理，都是不对的。那种认为街道小厂太分散，不好管，或者不考虑社会上多种多样的需要，盲目并入大厂，或加以消极限制的做法，也是错误的。正如周总理在“政府工作报告”中所指出的：“工业战线上的小型企业、土法生产的群众运动，应当继续开展，逐步提高。……千万不可以小看了它们的作用，小看了就会犯错误”。因此，为了更好地发挥街道工业的积极作用和它的潜力，进一步整顿、巩固和提高街道工业，加强党对街道工业的领导和管理，及时解决目前街道工业所存在的问题，是十分必要的。
    街道工业是集体所有制企业，同时具有若干全民所有制成份
    首先，街道工业的性质和发展方向、道路问题必须明确。武汉市街道工业创办初期，由于它是群众自筹资金、自己解决厂房、设备、原材料、技术力量等等，它一开始就是以一种集体所有制形式出现的。但是由于它的兴办，得到了国家的帮助、大厂的支援和街道党政组织对它所采取的一系列管理上的措施，它同时就具有若干全民所有制的成份，并且在发展的过程中，这种全民所有制成份的倾向在逐步增强起来。目前，它正处于由集体所有制向完全的全民所有制过渡的过程中，这个过渡，还需要一段时间，这段时间的长短，要看各个工厂群众的觉悟水平和生产的发展情况而定，不能一概而论。
    因时因地因人制宜，统一管理分散生产
    至于街道工业的生产发展方向和发展道路，要按照“全国一盘棋”的精神，和大中小型工业既相结合又有合理分工的原则，着重搞工、农业生产和人民生活方面的加工修理和日用生活必需品的生产，力所能及而又与大型工业的生产不相矛盾的小型独立制造，也是可以搞的。要始终坚持因时制宜、因地制宜、因人制宜、因陋就简、由小到大、由土到洋的逐渐发展的道路，任何脱离实际，盲目贪大、贪洋的做法，都是行不通的。同时，还要注意把产、供、销和生产管理等，力求纳入国家计划。在原材料供应上，除依靠国营大工业和国营商业来料加工，并由国家适当分配一部分原材料外，同时要自力更生，反复地综合利用旧料废品，寻找代用品；在产品销售上，除零星修补业务外，一般应尽可能采取加工、订货、统购、包销的形式；产品价格应服从市场统一管理。对于街道工业的某些产品的成本较高，完全按市场价格出售，不能维持生产的，商业部门应从扶植照顾的精神出发，在收购价格上，可考虑按照工业多赚，商业少赚，不赔不赚，在必要时予以补贴的原则处理。生产管理上，采取由街道实行统一管理、分散生产的办法。这样，便于加强计划管理，综合利用技术和生产设备，组织生产协作，对提高劳动生产率是有好处的。
    正确处理收益分配，使国家、集体、个人的分配比例合理
    第二，街道工业的收益分配问题。正确处理收益分配，使国家、集体、个人的分配比例合理，是目前发展街道工业的一个极待解决的问题。从扶植街道工业的发展，照顾街道集体福利事业的需要，保证个人收入的原则出发：（1）在税收上，采取从宽从简的原则，除工商统一税按规定缴纳外，国家对所得税的征收，大体上固定在企业利润百分之二十左右。另外，街道从利润中提取约百分之三十，作为兴办集体福利事业基金（其中应保持一定的比例，用于工厂职工福利，拨交各厂使用）；企业大体留百分之五十，作为扩大再生产投资方面的用途。这种分配比例经与群众协商确定后，由街道办事处进行财务管理和监督，统一调度，专款专用。以便分清主次和轻重缓急，保证在优先发展生产的基础上，兴办集体福利事业，达到有计划地统筹分配，合理使用。（2）对群众筹集的资金和生产资料，必须从积累中逐步还清。对一部分生产资料的折价，必须认真地合理审定，定期偿还。（3）为了保证淡季和生产不正常时的工资发放，可在工资总额中提取一定数量的附加工资，由成本内列支，大约全年留出一个月的工资额备用。如果这笔备用金不必动用，就可以转用于发展生产。
    要保持必要数量的全劳动力，过高过低的工资需要调整
    第三，劳动工资问题。街道工业的劳动力，一般都是就地解决的。根据前述情况，它既使用了半劳动力和辅助劳动力，同时也使用了全劳动力。为了保证街道工业巩固提高，劳动力应相对地稳定下来。去年在街道调了近七万个劳动力支援了大工业和基本建设，街道所余劳动力已有限了，特别是全劳动力已不多了。今后在支援国家建设的时候，要有计划地调配劳动力，特别要注意保持必要数量的全劳动力以维持街道工厂的生产。
    街道工厂的工资水平，目前情况是平均工资大体上接近于国营工厂，但有约百分之十的人的工资存在着过高过低的情况，这部分人的工资需要调整。过去工资的形式有月薪制、计件制、计时制（做一天活，给一天工资）、分成制四种，（其中以月薪制、计件制为最多，计时制、分成制较少。）前三种工资形式仍可保持，唯有分成制值得考虑。据我们调查的六个分成制的厂组，生产工人平均工资为九十七元六角，最高的五百元，最低的三十元。这显然是不合理的。对于同业不同街的工资水平，因生产发展的水平各不相同，允许有差别，但悬殊不能太大。对于某些工厂因开工不足或生产亏损而无法维持原定工资水平的，也可采取临时减发一部分工资的办法。总之，工资问题的解决，要有利于街道工厂的巩固和生产的发展。
    最后，我还想谈一谈街道的管理体制问题。随着街道工业的大量举办，城市市区的管理权力的下放，街道工作的内容日益复杂，因此，要很好研究城市的管理体制问题。街道工作的内容以生产为中心，范围是很广泛的。以利济街为例，他们管理了六十九个工厂、三百五十九个商店、二十五个集体福利事业、九个文教卫生事业。此外，还有房屋管理、民事调解、治安保卫、环境卫生等等，几乎是无所不包。已不是过去只管行政政治工作和居民生活的时候了。街道所管辖的居民一般是七、八千户、三万人左右，也有近万户，五、六万多人左右的。因此，街道一级的领导机构必须大大加强，对区街之间的管理权限应加以适当的调整，并且有必要考虑建立街道一级的基层政权。这样，使街道的领导机构既便于加强集中统一领导，又便于联系群众和发动组织群众。
  武汉市街道办工业的时间还很短，许多问题还来不及研究，存在的缺点和问题还很多，把这些情况向大会提出汇报，希望得到各位代表的批评和指正。
