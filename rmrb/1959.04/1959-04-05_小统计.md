    Small Statistics
    In the six years from 1953 to 1958, the national commercial departments purchased a total of 9.57 million tons of waste products. These waste products could fill more than 310,000 railcars with a capacity of 30 tons each; linked end-to-end, they could stretch from Manchuria in the northeast, passing through Beijing, to Changsha, Hunan Province. The state invested more than 2.8 billion yuan to purchase these waste products. This money could buy 8.5 million tons of chemical fertilizer.
    The vast majority of these waste products were sent to factories as raw materials. In recent years, the refined scrap copper alone could be used to manufacture more than 500 10,000-kilowatt power generating units.
    Of the scrap cloth purchased in the four years from 1955 to 1958, 75% was used as raw material for papermaking. They replaced wood pulp, saving more than 1.04 million cubic meters of timber, equivalent to the wood used for the entire Daobao-Chengdu Railway project. These rags could be used to manufacture more than 190,000 tons of paper. If cut and bound into elementary school student notebooks, assuming each student uses 20 notebooks a year, it could supply approximately 700 million elementary school students for one year.

    小统计
    全国商业部门从1953年到1958年六年间，共收购了九百五十七万吨废品。这些废品可以装三十一万多个容积三十吨的车厢；一辆一辆连接起来，从东北满洲里经过北京，可以排到湖南省长沙市。国家收买这些废品一共投放了二十八亿多元。用这些钱可以买八百五十万吨化学肥料。
    这些废品绝大部分都送进工厂做了原料。几年来，仅收购的杂铜，经过精炼就可以制造五百多台一万瓩发电设备。
    从1955年到1958年四年间收购的碎布，有75％作了造纸原料。它们代替木浆，节省了一百零四万多立方公尺木材，相当于三条多宝成铁路全部工程使用的木料。用这些破布可以制造十九万多吨纸张，如果裁开装订成小学生作业本，以每个小学生一年使用二十本计算，可供约七亿个小学生一年使用。
