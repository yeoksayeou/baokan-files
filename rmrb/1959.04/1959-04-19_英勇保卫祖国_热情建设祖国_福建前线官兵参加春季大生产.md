Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 18th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army's frontline troops in Fujian, while heroically defending the motherland, are allocating a large amount of manpower to actively participate in the spring production.

Currently, it is the peak season for the spring tide and fishing. Troops in coastal areas have separately established joint fishery protection headquarters with relevant local departments to safeguard the safe production of fishermen. Soldiers guarding the forward outposts often carry weapons and shoulder baskets, going to the sea fields with fishermen to rush to harvest oysters. On one occasion, when fishermen on Xiaodeng Island were rushing to harvest oysters, they were attacked by artillery fire from the Jinmen Chiang Kai-shek troops. The People's Liberation Army artillery units immediately returned fire, protecting the safety of the fishermen.

At various reservoir construction sites in Fujian Province, frontline troops are working side by side with the local people. At the large-scale Huinü Reservoir construction site, several thousand soldiers and civilians are working day and night. The soldiers at the construction site increased their daily earth excavation from three cubic meters per person to nine cubic meters, rapidly increasing the height of the reservoir dam. After the completion of this reservoir, it will be able to irrigate 240,000 mu of land and generate 1,050 kilowatts of electricity, fundamentally changing the face of Huian County, which suffers from drought nine years out of ten, transforming the "sweet potato county" into a "rice county."

The soldiers fighting at the Putian Dongzhen Reservoir construction site, the largest reservoir in Fujian Province, are undertaking the most arduous task of excavating more than twenty layers of hard rock to build the water conveyance channel. Troops stationed in the Xiamen area have already contributed 60,000 workdays to the Bantou Reservoir project.

In addition, the frontline soldiers have also made many contributions to spring plowing and sowing, accumulating and delivering fertilizer, planting trees, and afforestation, sending 4 million dan of various fertilizers to the people's communes and planting more than 539,000 trees.

Soldiers of a certain unit guarding Dadeng Island spent a month helping the Sandao People's Commune repair the salt fields that were destroyed by artillery fire from the Jinmen Chiang Kai-shek troops last year and build twelve high-water salt ponds, striving to increase salt production by 10,000 dan more than the original plan this year.

　　英勇保卫祖国　热情建设祖国
    福建前线官兵参加春季大生产
    新华社福建前线18日电　中国人民解放军福建前线部队，在英勇保卫祖国的同时，抽出大批人力，积极参加春季大生产。
    目前正是春潮鱼汛旺季。沿海各地部队，都已分别同当地的有关部门联合成立了护渔指挥部，保卫渔民安全生产。守卫在前哨岛屿上的官兵还常常携带武器和挑着箩筐，同渔民一道下海田，抢收海蛎子。有一次，小登岛的渔民在抢收海蛎子时遭受金门蒋军的炮火袭击，人民解放军炮兵部队当即予以还击，保护渔民安全。
    在福建省各个水库工地上，前线部队官兵们正在和当地人民并肩劳动。在规模宏大的惠女水库工地，有几千名官兵同民工们一道日夜奋战。工地上的官兵们由每人每日挖土三立方提高到九立方，使水库大坝迅速地增高。这个水库建成后，可灌溉二十四万亩土地，发电一千零五十瓩，将根本改变惠安县十年九旱的面貌，使“番薯县”成为“大米县”。
    战斗在福建省第一大水库莆田东圳水库工地上的官兵，担负了工程中最艰巨的任务——开凿二十级以上的顽石，修建输水道。驻厦门地区的部队已经为坂头水库工程投入了六万个劳动日。
    此外，前线官兵还在春耕播种、积肥送粪、植树造林等生产劳动中作了很多贡献，送给人民公社各种肥料四百万担，植树五十三万九千多棵。
    守卫在大登岛上的某部官兵利用一个月的时间，帮助三岛人民公社修复了去年被金门蒋军炮击破坏的盐田，并修建了十二个高水盐池，争取今年盐产量比原订计划增加一万担。
