　　Recently, many veteran teachers and scientists have been admitted into the Party. Such as President Chen Yuan, who is eighty years old, Minister Li Siguang, who is seventy years old, as well as comrades Zhou Peiyuan, Liang Sicheng, and others, they have all become glorious Communist Party members. After being admitted into the Party, they all used phrases like "gained a second life" and "started a second youth" to express their feelings. This is a great encouragement for the older generation of intellectuals.

　　Every patriotic, upright, and specialized older generation of intellectuals has spent a considerable amount of time in the disastrous old China, walking many rugged and uneven roads. At that time, they often harbored grand ideals and beautiful wishes, but they could not be realized, and they learned many skills but could not put them to use. Liberation, the Party brought light to the people of the whole country, and also brought hope to the intellectuals. With the prosperity of the country, the progress of society, and the flourishing of academic and cultural undertakings, the knowledge of intellectuals has a broad place to play its role. Last year, after the victory of the rectification movement, a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production emerged, and the cultural revolution and technological revolution began to enter a climax. This is precisely the time for intellectuals to "use their talents." We can imagine: how many young students need education? How many scientific research tasks need to be carried out? How many experiences in production struggles and class struggles need to be summarized? Just taking full-time universities as an example, last year they suddenly developed from more than two hundred to more than one thousand, how many teachers are needed to undertake teaching tasks? This is the real spring of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" for our intellectuals. The older generation of intellectuals, who have longed for many years to contribute their true talents and learning to society and serve the people, will no longer have any "untapped talents" today. Just as those comrades themselves said: even in their twilight years, they are still full of youthful breath.

　　During the Later Han Dynasty, Ma Yuan once said a famous saying: "The older, the stronger." This sentence has always been used by some elderly people who refuse to accept old age to encourage themselves and others, but in the past long years, I don't know how many people with lofty ideals lived in poverty and died with regret. "Waiting for the Yellow River to clear, how long is human life?" This statement reflects their melancholy and helpless mood. Only in today's socialist construction cause is booming, in the socialist era when both the old and the young can realize their ambitions, can we truly make those who refuse to accept old age "the older, the stronger" and make more contributions to the people. Among the working people, are there not many admirable and lovely old people who are called "old youths" and "old activists"?

　　We recently saw this glorious and fighting image of "the older, the stronger" in Comrade Foster, who has been paralyzed for fourteen years but has always been fighting at the age of seventy-eight. How moving his long letter to Chairman Mao was to us! In him, who can find the shadow of the word "aging"? No! There is only a strong fighting will, firm confidence in the future, and an optimistic spirit towards the proletarian revolutionary cause. Isn't this a model for all elderly people who are determined to serve the people (regardless of whether they are Communist Party members)? Although old in age, their ambitions remain, this is precisely the breadth of mind of the elderly in the socialist era. I remember that Mr. Zhu Ziqing once wrote two lines of poetry as his motto: "As long as the setting sun is infinitely good, why worry about approaching dusk." If viewed from a positive perspective, these two lines of poetry also contain the meaning of not accepting old age and can inspire people, not to mention that "second youth" is not the setting sun, but the warm morning sun!

　　The "older generation of intellectuals" we are talking about is only in comparison with young intellectuals. In fact, they are generally around forty, fifty, or fifty or sixty years old, in the prime of their lives, full of energy. Comrade Chen Yuan, who is eighty years old, does not relax his efforts to strive to be a glorious Communist Party member because he "heard the truth too late," and wants to take the present as the starting point for future struggles. Can our intellectuals who are not very "old" not be more motivated and rise up with great ambition?

    老当益壮
  　鲁歌
    最近，有许多老教师、老科学家被吸收到党的行列里来了。像八十高龄的陈垣校长，七十高龄的李四光部长，以及周培源、梁思成等同志，他们都已成了光荣的共产党员。他们在被吸收入党之后，都用“获得了第二次生命”、“开始了第二次青春”等语句来表示自己的心情。这对于老一辈的知识分子来说，是一个很大的激励。
    每一个爱国的、正直的、学有专长的老一辈知识分子，他们都在灾难深重的旧中国的环境里度过了相当漫长的岁月，走过许多崎岖不平的道路。那时，他们往往怀着远大的理想和美好的愿望，但不能够实现，学了许多本领，得不到发挥。解放了，党给全国人民带来了光明，也给知识分子带来了希望。随着国家的富强，社会的进展，学术文化事业的繁荣，知识分子的知识有了广阔的发挥作用的场所。去年，在整风运动胜利之后，出现了工农业生产大跃进，文化革命、技术革命开始进入高潮。这也正是知识分子们“英雄用武”之时，我们可以设想得到：多少青年学生需要教育？多少科学研究任务需要进行？多少生产斗争和阶级斗争的经验需要总结？只就全日制的高等学校来说，去年一下由二百多所发展到一千多所，就需要多少教师来担负教学任务？这是我们知识分子真正的“百花齐放”的春天。多年渴望把自己的真才实学贡献于社会、服务于人民的老一辈知识分子，在今天再也不会有什么“怀才不遇”的了。正像那些同志自己讲的：即使是垂暮之年，也仍然充沛着青春的气息。
    后汉时代，马援曾经说过一句名言：“老当益壮”，这句话历来为一些不伏老的老年人用来自勉勉人，但在过去那漫长的年代里，正不知有多少有志之士一生潦倒，含恨以终。“俟河之清，人寿几何？”这种说法，正是反映了他们的这种悒郁而又无可奈何的心情。只有在社会主义建设事业蓬勃发展的今天，在老老少少都能大展鸿图的社会主义时代，才能真正使得不伏老的人们“老当益壮”，为人民作更多的贡献。在劳动人民中间，被称为“老青年”，“老积极”的可敬可爱的老人，不是比比皆是吗？
    这种“老当益壮”的光辉的战斗的形象，我们最近从瘫痪了十四年、但是始终战斗着的七十八岁的福斯特同志身上看到。他给毛主席的那封长信是如何使我们感到激动啊！在他的身上，谁能找到“衰老”那个字眼的影子呢？没有！有的只是旺盛的战斗意志，对未来的坚定的信心，对无产阶级革命事业的乐观主义精神。这不是所有立志为人民服务的老年人（不管他是不是共产党员）的楷模么？年龄虽老雄心在，这正是社会主义时代老年人的胸襟。记得朱自清先生生前曾写过两句诗作为座右铭：“但得夕阳无限好，何须惆怅近黄昏。”如果从积极方面去看，这两句诗，也同样包含着不伏老的意味，能使人奋发，何况那“第二次青春”并不是夕阳，而是融融朝日呢！
    我们所说的“老一辈知识分子”，只是与青年知识分子相比而言，其实，一般都还在四、五十或五、六十左右的年龄，春秋正富，精力方强，八十岁的陈垣同志尚且不以“闻道过晚”而放松争取做一个光荣的共产党员的努力，并且要以现在作为今后奋斗的起点，我们并不十分“老”的知识分子，能不更加鼓足干劲，奋起壮心吗？
