Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 12th. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee held a grand banquet this afternoon to welcome Panchen Erdini, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and delegate to the National People's Congress.

Apei Awang Jinmei, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and delegate to the National People's Congress, National People's Congress delegates Jamdong Gyatso Namgyal, Shero Dongchu, National Committee member of the CPPCC Apei Tseten Drolkar, and Panchen Erdini's entourage all attended the banquet.

Wang Feng, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, representing the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, who came to Xi'an to welcome Panchen Erdini, and Liang Xuanxian, Secretary of the CPC Xigaze Sub-district Committee, who accompanied Panchen Erdini to Beijing, also attended the banquet.

Also present at the banquet were:

Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, Secretaries Zhao Boping and Fang Zhongru, Zhang Ce, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and First Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, Zhao Shoushan, Governor of Shaanxi Province, Li Qiming, Vice Governor, Sun Weiru, Vice Governor and Vice Chairman of the Provincial CPPCC, Yang Jiarui, Commander of the Shaanxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, Niu Shushen, Political Commissar, and others.

Panchen Erdini spoke at the banquet, first expressing his heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Central Government for their kind concern. He pointed out that the reactionary upper class clique in Tibet, cloaked in religious garb and flaunting the banner of safeguarding "national interests," carried out activities to undermine the unification of the motherland and national unity. Now, the disguised faces and despicable conspiracies of this group of reactionaries have been completely bankrupt before the people. He said: "Let the imperialists and foreign reactionaries weep before our victory!"

Panchen Erdini said: Now, the cause of building a democratic and socialist new Tibet, which the people expect, has entered a new historical stage. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and with the support of the 650 million people of the country, the rebellion in Tibet will be thoroughly quelled as soon as possible. National unity will be further strengthened, and the Tibetan people will continue to make new and greater contributions to the socialist family of the motherland.

In his speech, Panchen Erdini also expressed his warm gratitude to all circles in Shaanxi Province for their grand welcome and warm reception. He said: "I have passed through Xi'an several times, and each time I am deeply impressed that under the leadership of the Communist Party, this ancient city is becoming more and more prosperous. Today's Xi'an is very different from four years ago. There are many factories, and cultural and health undertakings have developed rapidly. In particular, the establishment of people's communes and the rapid improvement of people's communist ideology, and the rapid development of industry and agriculture have moved me deeply and left me with a deep and unforgettable impression. Here, I have seen the magnificent picture of socialist construction, which fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system." He expressed his sincere congratulations to the people of Shaanxi for the great achievements they have made under the leadership of the Party in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. At the end of his speech, he proposed a toast to the unity of the motherland and the great unity of all ethnic groups, and to Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, and the Communist Party of China.

Zhao Shoushan, Governor of Shaanxi Province, delivered a speech at the beginning of the banquet, warmly welcoming Panchen Erdini, Apei Awang Jinmei, and all other officials to Xi'an. He warmly congratulated the work in Tibet for entering a new historical stage, and expressed warm welcome and support for the efforts made by Panchen Erdini, Apei Awang Jinmei, and Tibetan patriotic figures to consolidate the unification of the motherland and strengthen national unity since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and congratulated the Tibetan people and the People's Liberation Army on the victory they have achieved in wiping out the Tibetan rebels. He expressed his firm belief that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will surely be able to lead the monks and lay people of Tibet, unite as one, and work together to achieve great achievements in the cause of building a democratic and socialist new Tibet. Zhao Shoushan finally raised his glass to congratulate the Tibetan people on their infinite brightness and happiness, and proposed a toast to the health of Acting Director Panchen and Vice Director Apei Awang Jinmei and all the officials.

The banquet proceeded in an atmosphere of unity, friendship, and joy. After the banquet, a welcome party was held.
