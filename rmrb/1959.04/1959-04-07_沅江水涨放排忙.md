    Yuan River Water Rises, Rafting Busily
    Zou Shengheng
        Peach blossoms bloom, apricot flowers fragrant,
        The Yuan River in March boasts fine scenery;
        Spring water rises three feet overnight,
        Releasing timber by tens of thousands of cubic meters.
    The Yuan River in spring is like a Miao girl's emerald silk ribbon, embroidered with a thousand reds and ten thousand purples. This major artery for transporting timber from the western Hunan forest area is particularly busy this year.
    The task of producing timber and nanmu bamboo in the Yuan River basin this year is 400% of last year's, equivalent to eight times the highest annual output before liberation. Huaihua County, famous throughout the country as the home of "Guangmu" known for its dense texture, straightness, and lack of knots, alone produced 400,000 cubic meters of timber.
    So much timber all depends on the Yuan River for transportation, and it must all be completed during the good water season. For the rafting workers, this is indeed a fierce battle.
    "We must make dangerous shoals yield a smooth path, and not let a single drop of river water flow in vain!" People put forward resolute and heroic slogans. When the spring flood had not yet arrived and the high mountains in the forest area were still covered with white snow, the CCP Huaihua County Committee organized the Party Committee Secretaries of six communes in the key timber production areas to establish an upstream Yuan River Bamboo and Timber Flow Command, selecting more than 700 rafting experts to form a flow transport army to launch a surprise attack on bamboo and timber transportation; requiring that the first batch of 100,000 timber logs be completed within twenty days from March 21. They creatively adopted a new method of "herding sheep with fir branches," greatly improving efficiency.
    The Hongjiang timber collection yard, with more than 490 workers, is responsible for the task of transferring nearly one million cubic meters of timber from the upper reaches of the Yuan River to Zuoshi. Compared with the pre-liberation period: the number of workers has been reduced by three-quarters, but the transportation task is five or six times greater. In addition, since the water level dropped after the winter last year, the flow transport plan was poorly completed in January and February this year. As a result, with the "peach blossom water" rising and timber rafts from the upper reaches pouring in, how could they cope? However, the workers, with soaring enthusiasm and daring to think and act, responded loudly to the Party's call: resolutely achieve "receive upon arrival, collect upon arrival, compile upon arrival, and transport upon arrival," ensuring that everything is completed during the good water season.
    In order to speed up rafting, the workers were unwilling to waste even meal times. Yard director Yao Kun, union chairman Liang Kaiyun, and others had to personally carry tea and meals to the rafts. In the rafting yard, transfer-type rafting machines and non-powered winch rafting machines, which improve efficiency by more than ten times, are working non-stop. The sound of motors and labor songs weave together into a passionate and unrestrained melody. Forty manual log-bundling machines are also being installed intensively. The first "satellite raft" in the history of the upper reaches of the Yuan River has been compiled by the collaboration of Jiang Zihua and Chen Jiaxing's groups. This raft has a材积 of 2,000 cubic meters, which is seven times larger than an average raft. These are all new creations of the yard's employees. It seems that people are becoming more and more enthusiastic about "skillful work." Technical innovation and tool improvement are truly like bamboo shoots after rain here. In this way, in the first four days of starting rafting, they compiled 18,000 cubic meters of timber rafts and dispatched 46 sets of timber rafts, improving efficiency three times compared to the past and saving 414 workdays.
    The Yuan River flows endlessly eastward. From Hongjiang to Zuoshi, an 800-li voyage, there are more than 130 famous dangerous shoals such as Qinglang Shoal, Huangshi Cave, and Ghost Gate. Before liberation, such songs were circulating on both sides of the Yuan River:
        Advise my love, advise my love,
        Advise my love not to go rafting;
        The big river has Huangshi Cave,
        The small river has Wild Boar Rock;
        How many rafters have a good end?
        They die in the water and are buried on the road.
    History is being changed by our great Party and great working people: the first timber raft propulsion engine and the "Xianglin No. 10" small steamship on the upper reaches of the Yuan River are constantly emitting green smoke, cutting through the green river surface, and towing a long string of timber rafts over shoals and dangers. In recent years, many ferocious shoals have been vigorously blasted by the forestry department; the huge dam project of Hongjiang Lusi Shoal, one of the guidance facilities for timber flow transport, is also under intense construction. The workers also created advanced tools such as "safe navigation day and night," "cable car over the pool," and "navigation direction pole," which greatly shorten the timber flow transport time and reduce labor intensity. Many workers carry books to learn culture during their rafting trips. In the past, people regarded rafting as a daunting task, but now it has become a pleasant and happy labor.

### 沅江水涨放排忙

    沅江水涨放排忙
    邹升恒
        桃花开，杏花香，
        沅江三月好风光；
        春水一夜涨三尺，
        放出木材千万方。
    春天的沅江，就像苗族姑娘们翠绿的丝带，绣着千红万紫的花边。这支湘西林区流送木材的大动脉，今年，显得格外繁忙。
    沅水流域今年木材、楠竹生产任务为去年的400％，相当于解放前最高年产量的八倍。单是以材质致密、通直无节著称全国的“广木”的故乡——会同县，就生产了四十万立方公尺的木材。
    这样多的木材，全靠沅水流送出去，而且要趁好水季节全部完成，对流送工人说来，确是一场激烈的战斗。
    “要滩险让出阳关道，叫河水点滴不空流”！人们提出了坚决、豪迈的口号。当春汛还未到来、林区里的高山上还复盖着白雪的时候，中共会同县委就组织了重点木材生产地区的六个公社党委书记，成立沅水上游竹、木流送指挥部，挑选七百多名放排能手，组成流送大军突击竹、木运输；要求从3月21日起，在二十天内完成第一批十万根木材的流送任务。他们创造性地采用了“杉条赶羊”的新方法，大大提高了功效。
    洪江集材场四百九十多名工人，担负着沅水上游近百万立方公尺木材转运陬市的任务。如果拿解放前来比较：工人减少了四分之三，而流送任务却大五、六倍。加之去年入冬以后，水位低落，今年一、二月份流送计划完成较差。这一来，“桃花水”涨，上游木排源源涌到，怎好开交呢？但是具有冲天干劲、敢想敢做的工人们响亮地回答了党的号召：坚决做到“随到、随收、随编、随运”，保证趁好水季节全部完成。
    为了加速编排，工人们连吃饭的时间都不肯白白放过，场长姚坤、工会主席梁开云等人只得亲自挑着茶饭送上排去。在编排场里，提高功效十多倍的传递式装排机、无动绞车装排机等机器，正在不停地工作，马达声和劳动歌声织成一片热情奔放的乐曲，四十台手摇捆木机，也在紧张地安装，沅水上游史无前例的第一列“卫星排”已由蒋自华、陈家兴两个小组协作编成。这个排拥有材积二千立方公尺，比一般的排大七倍，这些都是这个场的职工的新创造。看来，人们越来越热中于“巧干”了，技术革新和改良工具，在这里真如雨后春笋。就这样，他们在开始放排的头四天，就编好了木排一万八千立方公尺，开出四十六联木排，比过去提高功效三倍，节约劳动日四百一十四个。
    沅水，永无休止地滚滚东流。从洪江到陬市八百里航程，有青浪滩、黄狮洞、鬼门关等著名滩险一百三十多个。解放前，沅水两岸流传着这样的歌谣：
        劝郎乖，劝郎乖，
        劝郎莫去放木排；
        大河有个黄狮洞，
        小河有个野猪岩；
        放排能有几个好？
        水里死了路上埋。
    历史正由我们伟大的党、伟大的劳动人民改变着：沅水上游第一台木排推进机和“湘林十号”小火轮，成天吐着青烟，划破绿油油的江面，拖带着一长列、一长列的木排越滩过险。几年来，许多穷凶极恶的滩险，已经林业部门大力炸除；流送木材诱导设施之一的洪江鹭鸶滩巨大的拦河坝工程，也正在紧张施工。工人们还创造了“日夜安全行江”、“篦缆过潭”、“行江方向杆”等先进工具，都大大地缩短木材流送时间，减轻劳动强度。许多工人放排途中都带着书本学文化。过去人们把放排视为畏途，如今已成为愉快、幸福的劳动了。
