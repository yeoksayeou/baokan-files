Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi -- The Vietnam-China Friendship Association issued a statement on the 14th regarding China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, stating: "The Vietnam-China Friendship Association believes that Tibet is an integral part of China; the Chinese government's suppression of the rebels to protect the rights of the Tibetan people is China's internal affair, and no one should interfere." The statement said: “The Vietnam-China Friendly Association fully supports the Chinese government’s correct attitude and measures to quickly restore peace and order in Tibet, so that the Tibetan people can build their own beautiful life in the united family of all nationalities in China.” The statement condemned the United States for instigating the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's Wellington Conference to discuss the so-called "Tibetan issue." The statement said: This despicable behavior of US imperialism and its lackeys is part of the US conspiracy to alienate China's nationalities, interfere in China's internal affairs, alienate China from its neighbors, and create tension in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 16th -- Mongolian Buddhists issued a statement angrily condemning the former Tibetan upper-class reactionary group for colluding with imperialism to launch an armed rebellion, bringing disaster to the peaceful life of Tibetan monks and laypeople.

The statement, published in Mongolian newspapers on the 16th, said that Mongolian Buddhist monks, who have close ties with Tibetan Buddhist monks, had been excitedly watching the Tibetan monks and laypeople embark on the road to a happy life. However, the Tibetan reactionaries, with the support of US imperialism, colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in an attempt to create division. The statement emphasized that this dirty trick is forever despised by the people and violates Buddhist precepts. The masterminds of the rebellion will be completely eliminated.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th -- The Secretary-General of the Indonesian Peace Committee, Suroso, said at a press conference today that the Tibetan issue is China's internal affair, and other countries should not interfere. He pointed out that the Indonesian Peace Committee has always believed that the internal affairs of any country should be resolved by that country.

Suroso said that certain groups must intend to use the Tibetan issue to create tension in the relationship between China and India. He pointed out that such attempts should be stopped. He said that if the relationship between China and India, the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, becomes tense, some people will surely applaud.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th -- The "Hope Daily" in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, pointed out in a recent editorial that the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair, and foreign interference is not allowed.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th -- The Indonesian-language "New News" published an editorial today saying that the Tibetan rebellion was completely a counter-revolutionary rebellion, and resolving this issue is entirely China's internal affair. The editorial said that China cannot allow foreign interference in the Tibetan issue, which is understandable because such interference means interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The editorial said that if India actively interferes in the Tibetan issue, it means that India runs the risk of opposing China, which is detrimental to Asian and African countries.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th -- Santiago News: The Chilean "Century News" recently published an article condemning the propaganda carried out by imperialism on the Tibetan issue. The newspaper pointed out that the purpose of imperialism is to divide China and use Tibet as a base for war adventures. In order to provoke conflict and create a hotbed of war, imperialism is inciting Tibetan reactionaries to rise up against the People's Republic of China.

The "Century News" refuted the claim by imperialist news agencies that the Tibetan people are resisting the "rule of Red China." It pointed out that the truth is that the Chinese People's Liberation Army supports the Tibetan people against the reactionary class and the most aggressive group of world imperialism.

    “世纪报”驳斥了帝国主义通讯社的所谓西藏人民正在反抗“红色中国的统治”的说法。它指出事情的真象是，中国人民解放军支持西藏人民反对反动阶层和世界帝国主义最富有侵略性的集团。
