Sowers
    ——What are the people who built the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge doing now?
    Bridge Construction News Reporter

    For over a year, a great bridge has spanned the Yangtze River in Wuhan. A year ago, there was joyful hope and anxious anticipation; there was intense struggle, the clamorous sound of labor songs, and a chaotic array of cranes, ships, and frameworks blocking the river flow... All these exciting emotions and magnificent scenes have vanished, become a thing of the past.

    Only this long bridge remains. Whether in the misty mornings, the clear noons, or the brightly lit evenings, trains from the north and south rumble evenly and heavily across it; cars scurry back and forth like busy beetles; people walk hurriedly along the flower-patterned railings, or pause to gaze at the Yangtze River, at the prosperous, ever-developing city of Wuhan. It seems as if the bridge should have always been here, as if it has stood for a whole century.

    But where have the bridge builders gone? What are they doing now?

    In this era where one day equals twenty years, our nation's construction is like a dragon soaring through the waves, like wild horses galloping across the boundless plains. One after another, good news flies in from industry, agriculture, culture, and science. And where in our nation's rivers are new rainbows being erected?

    "The First Bridge Across the Ten-Thousand-Li Yangtze River!" What a heroic praise! And what a profound expectation, a serious urging it contains. The second bridge, the third bridge... where are they? When will natural barriers everywhere become thoroughfares?

    Dear comrades, friends, I have summarized the questions you raised in your letters. Thank you for your concern, and let me share some news you'd like to know.

    Bridge Flowers Bloom Across the Country

    A plant, a tree, as it grows strong, will send out countless branches, especially in suitable soil, climate, and with abundant rain and dew. The bridge-building team established and cultivated at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, nurtured by the care of the Party and the people, is now developed and strengthened. This is also the requirement of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and the need for the development of transportation.

    They didn't wait for the complete completion of the bridge before dispersing to various parts of the country. They had been to the Northeast, building bridges over the Songhua River; they built a new bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway at the Zhang River—upstream from the desolate ancient Bronze Sparrow Terrace; they lowered the same pipe columns as those used for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge into the roaring Hutuo River, and into the pebble layers of the Min River in Sichuan; at Tongguan, where "a cock's crow is heard in three provinces," and at Fengling渡口, they connected the Tongpu Railway and the Longhai Railway separated by the Yellow River; they had been to Baotou, and they also went to Macheng, although not to build bridges, but to build the foundations of water supply stations and reservoirs using the construction methods of the Wuhan Bridge foundation. They have now formed five independent combat units, building new bridges on five major rivers.

    If you go to Beijing and pass the Yellow River, look out of the right window of the train, and you will see a row of new piers, built by the First Bridge Engineering Bureau; have you heard of the Grand Canal Plan? From Beijing and Tianjin to Hangzhou, there are the North Canal, the Central Canal, and the South Canal, wider and deeper than those dug by Emperor Yang of Sui, capable of navigating large ships; however, they are not building the canal there, but building a bridge for the Longhai Railway to cross the Central Canal, built by the Second Bridge Engineering Bureau; have you been to Nanchang? The capital of Jiangxi Province, the birthplace of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Originally, there was only a highway bridge over the Gan River, no railway bridge. Now, the Third Bridge Engineering Bureau is building a double-track road-rail bridge. Newspapers reported the commencement of the "Second Bridge Across the Ten-Thousand-Li Yangtze River" last year, that is the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing, where the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway crosses the Yangtze River, and the Fourth Bridge Engineering Bureau is responsible for the construction. In the south, at the mouth of the Pearl River, at the famous Lychee Bay in Guangzhou, you can now see a similar scene to that before the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completed; thirty years ago, American imperialists intended to build a Southwest Bridge there, but it failed, leaving only a few crooked and useless piers. Now, the Fifth Bridge Engineering Bureau is building a road-rail bridge there, and the railways from Guangzhou to the Leizhou Peninsula and to Guangxi can be directly connected.

    These bridges all started construction last year and will be completed one after another this year, as bridge builders' gifts for the tenth anniversary of National Day; they will also go to new places to erect bridges. There are many bridge projects under design on the Yellow River and the Yangtze River waiting for them.

      Ten Thoroughfares Are Not Too Many

    Take the new bridges on the Yangtze River as an example! In Chongqing alone, there is more than just the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge; in the future, the Sichuan-Hunan Railway will still cross the Yangtze River in Chongqing, which is the Egongyan Yangtze River Bridge, which is already designed and awaiting investment and construction. The exploration and design of the Yidu, Wuhu, and Nanjing three major bridges in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are underway. The bridge-building scouts—drilling teams—have been inquiring about the road from the river's sediment and rocks for nearly a year; the Technical Science Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, assisted by the Bridge Bureau, organized a large scientific team, with more than thirty scientific research units and universities, collaborating on hundreds of topics, geological, hydrological, mechanical, structural, from foundation to pavement, from bridge type to architectural aesthetics, from construction machinery to applied materials, a series of issues are being organized for collective research. These experts, professors, students, and design and construction engineers, veteran workers, etc., have gathered in Wuhan twice. At the end of October last year, they proposed a fifty-day hard battle to solve the preliminary design problems of the three major Yangtze River bridges. Now this slogan has been realized. Never in history has such a complex and arduous design task been solved in such a short period. This is the victory of following the mass line in design work, the victory of the correct policy of combining the Party's scientific research, education, and production, and the victory of the idea of communist collaboration.

    Preparations for the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge have begun, and construction will begin this year. The scale of this bridge is two to three times larger than the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

    Therefore, the construction of the Nanjing Bridge is not a simple repetition of the Wuhan Bridge project, but a more extensive, arduous, and complex task. More than a year ago, the fighting scenes on the Wuhan Yangtze River day and night will write a new epic for the ancient stone city on a grander scale and with greater enthusiasm. Jinling, with its dragon coiling and tiger crouching, will become even more beautiful with a bridge flying across it.

  The Landscape Is Like a Painting, How Many Heroes for a Time

    Comrades, friends, in our era, all work is extremely meaningful, and I don't want to particularly emphasize bridge construction. But when you have the opportunity to visit a bridge construction site, you will surely be attracted by this complex and changing struggle, this bold and meticulous creative labor. The natural enemy we face is the beautiful and extremely fierce and cunning river. The vast water surface conceals various soils and rocks, and you need to know it clearly; and each river has its unique character, constantly changing, and you also need to understand it, and learn to control it and use it. You cannot completely treat it as an enemy. When people's wisdom and labor can overcome its bad character, it will become your friend, the water will help with the work, the rocks and soil will faithfully carry the piers, bear the steel beams, and let cars and trains run freely on them. But if you can't control it, overnight or even in a few hours or minutes, it will destroy all your hard work. It is not too willing to have any piers blocking its flowing path. Therefore, such a complex struggle, such labor that requires both courage and wisdom, is very interesting. On every bridge construction site, it can be described as: "The landscape is like a painting, how many heroes for a time!"

    On the roaring bank of the Hutuo River, why is the old hero Shi Jingren pondering with his white beard? He is thinking: What is the reason that is preventing the sinking of the pipe columns?

    Against the backdrop of Maoerxia, why are a group of young drillers cheering on Pier No. 3? They have passed the first pipe column through a lone rock and down to the rock stratum.

    Why has the gantry crane on the Yellow River changed its appearance? The rationalization proposal of the Qin Hongfa work team has been realized, and their heavy labor has been replaced by machinery.

    On the Gan River, you can see pipe columns with a diameter of 5.8 meters sinking at an almost miraculous speed, with an average of one pier appearing on the Gan River every twelve days.

    What are people discussing at the Lychee Bay construction site? After carefully studying the situation, they put forward a suggestion: eliminate one pier!

    Every day and night, there are things like this. This is the result of the Party's call to break superstitions, liberate thought, and make a big technical revolution. In the invention and improvement of machinery, it is a time of blossoming flowers, combining native and foreign methods. The electric saw team on the south bank of the Yellow River improved the electric saw machine, and the small machine can saw large logs; Zhou Changqing of the Grand Canal created a simple gantry crane; Ling Zhiquan, a blacksmith in the Yellow River Electromechanical Team, created an automatic cold air machine to forge iron, eliminating the need to swing the sledgehammer. There is a bamboo shed on the edge of the Gan River, which is an electrical tool factory established from scratch by Zhang Jinbao and Chen Zaorui. They can manufacture electric welding machines, safety transformers, portable spot welding machines.... The steel bar workshop on the north bank of the Yellow River is now full of joy and can continuously overfulfill its tasks because foreman Li Wanchun led everyone to create a steel bar flattening machine; the carpentry workshop in Baishatuo is using a homemade electric planer to polish model boards... There is no end to these creations. These creations have solved major problems on the construction site, reduced human physical labor, and further mechanized bridge construction.

      The Bridge Machinery Manufacturing Factory was established last year. December 25, 1958, was a festive day. The employees of the Bridge Machinery Factory gave a final touch to their new product—the 160-type vibrator. China's first 6T steam pile driver was completed, and there were more than twenty brand-new lathes in their workshop, all manufactured by themselves.

        Newcomers of the Past Become Veterans

    Over the past year, technical strength has grown and developed; the newcomers at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have now become veterans, and these veterans are bringing up even more apprentices; in our era, people's progress is very rapid; not long ago, a new group of divers on the Gan River completed their initial training and began their first day of work; riggers, carpenters, concrete workers, lathe operators, welders, riveters... new people can be seen everywhere.

    The overall construction force has doubled compared to the Wuhan Bridge.

    In the face of new tasks, this increase in new forces will surely boost morale and create an even greater leap forward. All this is the result of the Party's leadership, mobilizing the masses, and making a big technical revolution.

    We, the builders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, will follow the Party's general line for socialist construction, build more and more beautiful bridges for the motherland quickly, well, and economically, and will not disappoint the people's hopes. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is only the starting point of our bridge-building enterprise.

    ——建设武汉长江大桥的人们现在在做什么
    桥工报记者
    一年多了，在武汉的长江上出现了一座大桥。一年多以前，在这里曾有过希望的欢欣，期待的焦灼；在这里曾有过紧张的搏斗，喧嚣的劳动歌声和一些横七竖八、壅塞着江流的吊机、船舶和构架……这一切激动的感情，庞杂宏伟的景象都没有了，过去了。
    只留下这座长桥。不论是晓雾迷蒙的早晨，或晴朗的中午，或华灯灿烂的晚上，南来北往的列车发出均匀沉重的轰响隆隆驶过；汽车像忙碌的甲虫一样来来去去；人们在那镶着铸花的栏杆边匆匆走过、或停留一会眺望长江，眺望着繁荣的建设着的武汉市。好像它早就应该存在这儿，而已经存在了整整一世纪似的。
    而建桥的人们哪里去了？现在正做些什么？
    在这一天等于二十年的时代里，祖国的建设像破浪腾空的飞龙，像无际平原的奔马，工业、农业、文化、科学一个个捷报飞传；而我们祖国的江河上，哪里又架起长虹？
    “万里长江第一桥”！是多么豪迈的赞语。而又含着多么深切的期望，严肃的督促。第二桥、第三桥……在哪里？在什么时候天堑随处是通途？
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们，我在这里概括了你们来信所提的问题，谢谢你们的关怀，也告诉一些你们愿意知道的消息。
    桥梁花朵　开遍全国
    一株花，一棵树，当它成长壮大的时候，就会分出无数枝，特别是在适宜的土壤、气候、充沛的雨露中。在武汉长江大桥建立和培养的建桥队伍，有了党和人民的关怀哺育，现在是发展了、壮大了。这也是工业农业大跃进的要求，交通运输事业发展的需要。
    他们并没有等到大桥全部完工就开始分散到祖国各地去了。他们曾到过东北，在松花江上架过桥梁；他们在漳河——荒芜的古铜雀台的上游，修起了一座京汉线的新桥；他们把和武汉长江大桥同样的管柱，下到咆哮的滹沱河中，下到四川的岷江的卵石层里；他们在“鸡唱闻三省”的潼关和风陵渡口，把被黄河隔开的同蒲路和陇海路联结起来；他们到过包头，他们也去过麻城，虽然不是修桥，而是用武汉大桥基础的施工方法，修建给水站和水库的基础。他们现在已形成了五个独立的战斗单位，正在五个大河上修建新桥。
    你假若到北京去，路过黄河，从右边的车窗望出去，一排新的桥墩，那就是第一桥梁工程处在那里干的；你听到过大运河计划吗？从北京、天津到杭州，那里分北运河、中运河、南运河，比隋炀帝挖的还宽还深，能航行大轮船；不过他们在那里不是修运河，而是修一座陇海铁路跨过中运河的桥，那就是第二桥梁工程处；你们到过南昌吗？江西省的省会，中国人民解放军诞生的地方，原来赣江上只有公路桥，没有铁路桥，现在第三桥梁工程处正在那里修一座双轨的公路铁路两用桥。报纸上曾在去年发表过“万里长江第二桥”开工的消息，那就是在重庆市的白沙沱长江大桥，是川黔铁路经过长江的地方，在那里负责施工的就是第四桥梁工程处。南方，珠江口上，广州市有名的荔枝湾那里，现在也能看到在长江大桥未修成前的类似景象；那里三十年前美帝国主义者曾打算修一个西南大桥，没有修成只留下几个东歪西倒、毫无用处的桥墩，现在第五桥梁工程处正在那里修一座铁路公路两用桥，从广州到雷州半岛和到广西的铁路就能直通了。
    这些桥都是去年开工的，到今年就要先后竣工，作为建桥工人们对国庆十周年的献礼；他们还将到新的地方去架设桥梁，黄河上和长江上就还有不少正在设计的桥梁工程等待着他们。
      通途十道不为多
    就拿长江上新的大桥来说吧！单只重庆这一个地方，就不只一个白沙沱长江大桥；将来的川湘线仍将在重庆市跨过长江，那就是已经设计正待投资兴建的鹅公岩长江大桥。长江中下游宜都、芜湖、南京三大桥的勘探设计正在进行，建桥的侦察兵——钻探队，已经向江心的泥沙和岩石问询道路近一年了；中国科学院技术科学部协助大桥局组织了广大的科学队伍，有三十几个科学研究单位和高等院校，正协作研究成百项的课题，地质的、水文的、力学的、结构的，从基础到路面，从桥式到建筑美术，从施工机械到应用的材料，一系列的问题正组织集体研究。这些专家、教授、学生和设计、施工的工程师、老工人等，已经在武汉集会了两次。他们在去年10月底提出了五十天苦战，解决长江三大桥的初步设计问题，现在这个口号已经实现了，历史上从来没有在这样短的期间，解决过这样复杂的艰巨的设计任务。这是设计工作走群众路线的胜利，党的科学研究、教育与生产相结合的正确方针的胜利，共产主义大协作思想的胜利。
    南京长江大桥的准备工作已经开始了，今年就要开工兴建。这个桥的规模比武汉长江大桥要大两三倍。
    所以，修建南京大桥，不是武汉大桥工程的简单重复，而是更庞大、更艰巨和更复杂的任务。一年多以前，日日夜夜在武汉长江上的战斗景象，将以更雄壮的规模，更大的干劲，为古老的石头城写下新的史诗，龙蟠虎踞的金陵，将为一桥飞跨而更加美丽。
  江山如画　一时多少豪杰
    同志们，朋友们，在我们这个时代，一切的工作都是极有意义的，我不想特别强调桥梁建设工作。可是当你能有机会到桥梁工地看一看的时候，你一定为这种复杂变化的斗争，大胆而细致的创造性的劳动所吸引；我们面对着的自然敌人，是美丽如画而又极为凶猛狡猾的江河，茫茫的水面隐蔽着各种土壤和岩石，你需清楚的知道它；而每个江河又都有它独特的性格，千变万化，你也需要了解它，而且要学会控制它，使用它。你不能完全把它看作敌人，当人们的智慧和劳动能克服它的恶劣性格，它就会成为你的朋友，水会帮助工作，岩石和土壤会忠诚的背负着桥墩，承担起钢梁，让汽车、火车在上面尽情的奔跑。可是你假若控制不住它，一夜之间甚至几小时几分钟之间，它会摧毁你一切辛苦的成果，它是不太乐意在它奔流的道路上有什么桥墩来阻碍它的。所以，这样复杂的斗争，这样既需勇敢又需智慧的劳动是很有意思的。在每一个桥梁工地上，都可以这样形容：“江山如画，一时多少豪杰！”
    在咆哮的滹沱河岸上，老英雄石景仁为什么在摸着花白的胡子深思？那是他在思索：是什么原因阻止了管柱的下沉？
    映着猫儿峡的背景，一群青年钻工为什么在三号墩上欢呼？那是他们将第一根管柱通过了孤石下到岩层。
    黄河上龙门吊架为什么变了样子？那是秦洪发工班的合理化建议实现了，他们繁重的劳动已为机械所代替。
    赣江上，你可以看到五点八公尺直径的管柱，简直是以一种奇妙的速度在下沉，平均十二天在赣江上出现一个桥墩。
    荔枝湾的工地，人们在讨论什么？他们在仔细的研究了情况以后，提出建议：省掉一个桥墩！
    每日每夜，都有这一类的事。这是党在提出破除迷信、解放思想后大闹技术革命的结果。在机械的发明、改进上，正是百花齐放，土洋并举。黄河南岸电锯组改进了电锯机，小机器能锯大原木了；中运河周长清创造了简易龙门架；黄河机电分队锻工凌志泉创造了自动冷风机来打铁，无需抡开臂膀来挥动大锤了。赣江边上有个竹棚，那是张进宝和陈造瑞他们白手
  起家建立的一个电力工具制造厂，那里能制电焊机、安全变压器、手提碰焊机……。黄河北岸钢筋车间现在已喜气洋洋地能不断超额完成任务了，因为李万春工长带领大家创造了一台钢筋锤平机；白沙沱的木工间用自制的电刨在
  刨光模型板……这些创造是说不完的。这些创造在工地上解决了大问题，减轻人的体力劳动，使桥梁施工进一步走向机械化。
      在去年成立了桥梁机械制造厂。1958年12月25日是一个喜庆的日子，桥机厂的职工在最后打扮一下他们的新式产品——160型震动机，我国第一台6T蒸汽打桩机制成了，还有他们的车间里摆着二十几台崭新的车床，都是自己制造的。
        当年新手变老手
    一年来，技术力量在壮大，在成长；武汉长江大桥时的新手现在已经成了老手，而且这些老手又在带起数目更多的徒弟；在我们这个时代，人的进步是很快的；前不久，赣江上一批新的潜水工已完成了他们的初步训练，开始了第一个劳动日；装吊工、木工、混凝土工、车工、电焊工、铆工……也处处看到新人。
    整个的施工力量比武汉大桥时增加了一倍。
    在新任务的面前，这些新的力量的增加，一定会鼓足干劲，来一个更大的跃进。这一切都是党的领导，发动群众，大闹技术革命的结果。
    我们，武汉长江大桥的建设者，将遵循着党的社会主义建设总路线，多快好省地为祖国修建更多更美的大桥，将不辜负人民的希望。武汉长江大桥不过是我们建桥事业的起点。
