    Meticulous
    Guo Moruo's "Sitting on the Ground, Surveying the Heavens, and Others" was published on the seventh page of the People's Daily on March 4th. Guo Moruo's meticulous spirit of correcting mistakes deeply moved me. He carefully checked two inappropriate places in his answers to the "Poetry Journal" and gave detailed and thorough explanations, avoiding the possibility of "perpetuating errors." Regarding the error in the explanation of the schistosomiasis egg hatching problem, he said it "was due to relying on his own smattering of knowledge." Such frank and strict self-reproach made me admire him. After discovering his own smattering of knowledge, he immediately consulted books to obtain a complete understanding. Such a serious attitude towards learning is truly a role model for us young people.

    一丝不苟
    人民日报3月4日第七版上刊出了郭沫若同志的“坐地、巡天及其他”。郭沫若同志那种一丝不苟、有错即改的精神，深深地感动了我。他认真地检查了答“诗刊”社问中两处不妥当的地方，作了详细透彻的解释，避免了“以讹传讹”的可能。对于血吸虫卵孵化问题解释中的错误，他说“是由于凭着自己的一知半解”。这样坦率严格的自责，使我钦佩。在发觉自己的一知半解后，即查书求得全解，对学问如此认真的态度，真是我们青年人学习的榜样。
