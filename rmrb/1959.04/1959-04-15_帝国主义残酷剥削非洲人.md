	Imperialism Cruelly Exploits Africans
    The American "National Guardian" published an article by Kumar Goshal on April 13, revealing the cruel exploitation of African people by imperialist countries such as the United States.

    The article, entitled "Africa Today: The Newest and Greatest Battleground for Human Freedom," wrote, "Africa today is the battlefield for the last great struggle for colonial freedom. Here, Western countries and white immigrants are attempting to stubbornly and brutally cling to this continent's vast resources and the enslaved labor of Africans at all costs."

    The article revealed, "Since World War II, American investment in Africa has increased several times in a short period. It has increased from 93 million US dollars in 1936 to more than 800 million US dollars last year. Most of the investment is in the traditional colonial natural production industries: oil extraction, rubber, iron ore, and copper mines. The profit rate of American investment in the entire African continent has been about 21% to 25% annually since 1951."

    The article also revealed, "As of 1955, imperialist countries had extracted at least 14 billion US dollars from South African mines, more than 2 billion US dollars from Northern Rhodesia (mainly copper mines), 1 billion US dollars from Southern Rhodesia's mines, and an undisclosed amount of profits from the uranium mines in the Belgian Congo. The West has obtained approximately 20 billion US dollars worth of minerals from south of the equator in Africa."

    The article said that the Bandung Conference, the Conference of Independent African States, and the All-African People's Conference in recent years "have boosted the morale of Africans who are still striving for freedom." The author of the article concluded, "Africans will not tolerate foreign investors extracting their natural wealth for long, nor will they tolerate the brutal exploitation of their labor for long."

### 帝国主义残酷剥削非洲人

　　帝国主义残酷剥削非洲人
    美国“国民前卫报”4月13日发表库马尔·戈夏写的一篇文章，透露了美国等帝国主义国家对非洲人民的残酷剥削。
    这篇以“今日非洲：争取人类自由最新和最大的战场”为题的文章写道，“非洲今天是争取殖民地自由的最后一次伟大斗争的战场。在这里西方国家和白种移民企图以不顾一切的顽固态度和冷酷的野蛮手段死死不放弃这片大陆的巨大资源和非洲人的奴役劳动”。
    文章透露，“自从第二次世界大战以来，美国在非洲的投资短期内猛增数倍。从1936年的九千三百万美元增加到去年的八亿美元以上。大多数的投资都是投在传统的殖民地的天然生产工业上：石油开采、橡胶、铁矿和铜矿。美国在整个非洲投资的利润率自从1951年以来每年约为21％到25％”。
    文章还透露，“截至1955年，帝国主义国家至少从南非矿藏中榨取了一百四十亿美元，从北罗得西亚（主要是铜矿）榨取了二十亿美元以上，从南罗得西亚的矿藏中取得十亿美元，从比属刚果的铀矿中取得数目不详的利润。西方从南赤道非洲取得了约值二百亿美元的矿产”。
    文章说，近年来的万隆会议、非洲独立国家会议和全非人民大会“提高了仍在争取自由的非洲人的士气”。文章的作者得出结论说，“非洲人将不会长期容忍外国投资者榨取它们的天然财富，也不会长期容忍对他们劳动的野蛮剥削”。（新华社）
