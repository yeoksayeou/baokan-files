    Thriving Vigor
    ——New Spring Vistas in the Zhangshi People's Commune
    By our reporter Yang Wenquan
    The first spring plowing production of the famous Zhangshi People's Commune in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, was completed victoriously one solar term earlier than last year, thanks to the enthusiastic drive of all commune members to achieve a bumper harvest of grain. More than 40,000 mu of early rice in the entire commune have been transplanted on time and with good quality, and the 20,000 mu of potato, oilseed crops, and cash crops that were sown earlier are also growing vigorously. Now, the vast fields between the green hills and clear waters are covered in new green attire, presenting a vibrant and thriving scene. Groups of male and female commune members are busily carrying out early field management work such as fertilization and weeding.
    The Zhangshi Commune is located in the mountainous area of northern Guangdong, with high mountains and cold water, and the seasons have always been later. However, this year's spring plowing production entered a climax early. In early February, when the earth was still chilly, commune members braved the cold wind and rain to sow spring crops and the first batch of grain seeds, creating a new scene on the commune's land where seedlings were green before the spring grass sprouted. By the end of March, the seedlings had generally grown, and the transplanting season had arrived. The commune members held a rally of ten thousand people and plunged into the battle of transplanting early rice under the battle cry of "Seizing Time and Competing for Spring Colors." Every morning, the production teams beat gongs and drums, and people cheered as they headed to the fields with high morale, plowing and transplanting. The number of people working in the entire commune reached 11,000. All the commune's labor force, except for a very few people who persisted in industrial and other production, was put into transplanting, achieving full attendance every day. The labor competitions in the production teams were also in full swing. Many production teams sent battle reports to each other, vowing to compete, and there were lively scenes of fathers and sons, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, husbands and wives, and brothers and sisters challenging each other. Although this year's early rice was densely planted, and the workload per mu was much greater than last year's early rice, the average daily transplanting amount per person in the entire commune was still as high as eight or nine fen of land, nearly double that of last year. At the same time, the commune cadres further promoted the excellent style of taking the lead in hard work, participating in production, and leading production, and fought alongside the peasants. The 2,500 staff, students and teachers of the commune's organs, schools and shops also formed a transplanting shock team to support the rush planting in the production teams. Therefore, the transplanting time for the commune's more than 40,000 mu of rice fields was shortened by ten days compared with last year, and the entire spring plowing production was completed victoriously twenty days earlier than last year.
    Due to the implementation of the principle of unified leadership and decentralized management, the initiative and enthusiasm of the production teams in spring plowing production have been further brought into play. They have all been tapping their potential to ensure continued leap forward. After the main labor force first completed the tasks assigned by the commune on time and with good quality, the production teams also actively used the abandoned land to plant rice and spring crops in order to produce more grain and other products.
    This year's spring plowing production in the Zhangshi Commune was carried out on the basis of more solid and reliable measures. The commune Party committee, in accordance with the changes in the seasons, firmly grasped the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, laying a solid foundation for a bumper harvest of early rice.

    ——记樟市人民公社春天的新气象
    本报记者  杨文全
    著名的广东省韶关市郊区樟市人民公社的第一次春耕生产，在全体社员夺取粮食大丰收的热劲下，比去年提早一个节令胜利完成。全社四万多亩早稻已按时按质插下秧，较早播种的二万亩薯类、油料作物和经济作物也都生长茂盛。现在，那青山绿水间的广阔田野已披上绿色新装，呈现出一片青葱娇翠、欣欣向荣的景象，成群结队的男女社员正在忙碌地进行着施肥、除草等早期田间管理工作。
    樟市公社地处粤北山区，山高水冷，一向季节较迟。但是，今年春耕生产提早进入高潮。2月初，当大地寒气袭人的时候，社员们就冒着寒风冷雨开始播种春种作物和首批谷种，使公社的土地上出现前所未有的春草未绿秧先绿的新景象。3月底，秧苗普遍长大，插秧季节已经到来，社员们又举行了万人誓师大会，在“抢时间争春色”的战斗口号下投入早稻插秧战斗。每日清晨，各生产队就金鼓齐鸣，人声鼎沸，斗志昂扬地奔向田间，耙田和插秧。全社出勤的人数达到了一万一千人，整个公社的劳动力，除极少数人坚持工业等生产外，都投到插秧中来了，做到了天天满勤。各生产队的劳动竞赛也搞得热火朝天，许多生产队上门互送战表，誓比高低，并且出现了一些父子、婆媳、夫妻和兄妹之间互相挑战应战的热闹情景。虽然由于今年早稻密植，每亩插秧时的工作量比去年早稻增加很多，但全社每人平均日插量却仍然高达八、九分田，比去年提高将近一倍。同时，公社干部进一步发扬了带头苦干、参加生产领导生产的优良作风，和农民们一起，带头奋战。公社各机关、学校和商店的二千五百名职工、师生也组成插秧突击队，到各生产队去支援抢插。因此，全社四万多亩稻田的插秧时间比去年缩短十天，整个春耕生产比去年提早二十天胜利完成。
    由于实行了统一领导、分级管理的原则，各生产队在春耕生产中的主动性和积极性进一步发挥出来了，他们纷纷挖掘潜力，保证继续跃进。各生产队在以主要劳力首先按时按质完成公社下达的任务后，还积极利用丢荒的土地种植水稻和春种作物，以生产更多的粮食和其他产品。
    樟市公社今年的春耕生产是在措施更加扎实可靠的基础上进行的。公社党委按照季节的变化，紧紧地抓住了“八字宪法”的全面执行，为早稻大丰收打下了坚实基础。
