Comrade Representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and other reports.

The former local government of Tibet and the reactionary upper strata launched an armed rebellion betraying the motherland and undermining unity. The Central People's Government adopted resolute measures to quell the rebellion, enabling the Tibetan people to free themselves from the shackles of serfdom and realize their desire for democratic autonomy and social progress. I express my heartfelt support for this.

Now, I will briefly report to the conference on the main work of Hunan Province in organizing the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1959.

1958 was a year of comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction of the Chinese Communist Party and a set of "walking on two legs" principles, through the vigorous efforts of the people of the province, Hunan's industrial and agricultural production has grown tremendously, and other national economic and cultural construction undertakings have also achieved great success; the people's commune has been victoriously realized in the rural areas of the province; the living standards of the broad masses of people have been significantly improved; the people's ideological outlook has been greatly changed, and the communist spirit has been vigorously promoted; leaders and cadres at all levels have further understanding and experience in the laws of socialist economic development, working methods have been greatly improved, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer. On this basis, this year, the industrial and agricultural production of our province is striding forward and continuing to leap forward, and a new upsurge of industrial and agricultural production is developing healthily.

Organizing the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production this year is the urgent demand and strong desire of the broad masses of people. To concentrate the demands and desires of the broad masses for continued leap forward, and to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, it is necessary to focus on solving the problems that the masses urgently need to solve in the course of their advancement. We are precisely consulting with the masses to carry out these tasks.

Implementing Planned Grain Consumption is Widely Welcomed by the Masses

The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more necessary it is to care for the lives of the masses; the more we care for the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses. This is how we did it in last year's Great Leap Forward, and we must continue to do so in organizing this year's production re-leap forward. After last year's bumper harvest, the people of the province engaged in large-scale steel smelting. At that time, we focused on production and did not pay enough attention to grain management, resulting in excessive grain consumption by the masses, and the phenomenon of wasting grain was quite common, and in some places, it was quite serious. Because the harvest was so good, people easily overlooked planned grain consumption psychologically, thinking that "there is plenty anyway, it doesn't matter if we waste a little." However, we must know that our country is a large country with a population of more than 600 million. If everyone wastes a little, the accumulated amount will be an alarming figure. After the completion of the steel task, according to the central government's instructions to care for the lives of the masses and the masses' reasonable grain consumption requirements, we first strengthened grain management work. During the busy spring plowing season, it is a prerequisite for the masses to eat their fill and eat well to maintain abundant energy and strong physical strength. After careful investigation, we decided that from April 1st until the new harvest, the average rural population in the province would be guaranteed a supply of 40 catties of raw grain per month. According to recent more accurate statistics, the province's 1,112 people's communes are basically supplying according to the 40-catty standard. Although some places, such as Xiangxi, Qianyang, and Changde areas, still have 50 to 60 catties per person per month, there are also 76 communes, due to remote areas, transportation difficulties, and excessive grain consumption in the past, temporarily only have 35 to 37.8 catties. As long as we strengthen the cultivation and management of spring harvest crops, grow more melons and vegetables, and make careful calculations, the grain supply of these 76 communes can also be fully guaranteed. Each farmer is guaranteed an average supply of 40 catties of grain per month during the so-called "lean season." This standard is unprecedented in the history of Hunan and is a matter of great significance. Such a reasonable arrangement of rations has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people. Many people, especially three groups of people, feel this most deeply. They said: "Being able to eat so much grain during the lean season is something that has never happened before. Only by working hard and achieving a greater leap forward can we be worthy of the Party and the government." These are the words from the hearts of the farmers of the province, and they are also a huge driving force for further exerting the labor enthusiasm of the masses.

Promoting Increased Production Technology Must Be Through the Masses

The great agricultural harvest of 1958 was inseparable from the promotion of advanced technical measures. In the work of promoting increased production technical measures, we have a basic experience, that is, we must go through the masses and through experiments. With the arrival of spring plowing, the issue that the masses are most concerned about in terms of increased production technical measures is the problem of close planting of rice. Close planting can increase production, which has been affirmed by the fact of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and summarized in the "Eight-Character Charter." From cadres to the masses, few people doubt its authenticity anymore. The problem lies in the appropriate degree of close planting. The masses have quite a debate about this. We seize this key issue and launch a mass debate on the issue of close planting of rice throughout the province. From the debate, the masses unanimously came to the following conclusion: The reputation of reasonable close planting is very good. If you want to increase production, you must plant closely; however, the degree and specifications of close planting must be based on the actual situation of natural conditions and farming technical conditions, adapting to the time and place, and at the same time, adopting comprehensive technical measures. The broad masses of people are very concerned about the specifications of close planting. When talking to farmers, touching on this issue, there is a lot of discussion, and the field cannot be cleared for a long time. Cadres of the Dayaoshan Commune in Liuyang held a meeting, and the masses actively inquired about the news about close planting specifications. Some cadres said: "Only when land was reformed and classes were divided were they so concerned." The masses' concern reflects their strong sense of responsibility for achieving the Great Leap Forward, and also reflects their desire to strive for a bumper harvest. The opinions of many masses and model laborers are: no matter how closely planted, the bottom line is that people can go into the field and weed the rice. In this way, the rice will be able to tiller very well, and the rice roots will be able to fully absorb fertilizer. We are based on these opinions to stipulate the limits of close planting.

In accordance with the spirit of the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, we have carried out the work of rectification, consolidation, and improvement in the people's communes throughout the province, and have achieved significant results. For the preparation work for this year's spring plowing production, such as water conservancy, manure accumulation, deep plowing, seeds and feed, and labor force arrangement, we have grasped them earlier and more carefully than in previous years. Now, the province's early rice transplanting has been fully completed, and we have opened up a victorious situation for realizing a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year. We believe that under the leadership of the Central Committee, under the guidance of the general line, as long as we continue to carry forward the working style of the mass line, consult with the masses in everything, closely rely on the masses, seize the time, and never let up, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and turn this year's agricultural production plan targets into glorious reality.

### 依靠群众排除万难实现计划  谭余保代表谈湖南省今年农业生产继续大跃进

    依靠群众排除万难实现计划
    谭余保代表谈湖南省今年农业生产继续大跃进各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的“政府工作报告”和其他各项报告。
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动背叛祖国、破坏统一的武装叛乱，中央人民政府采取了坚决的平息叛乱措施，使西藏人民现在已经有可能摆脱农奴制的枷锁，实现民主自治和社会进步的愿望。对此，我表示衷心的拥护。
    现在，我将湖南省组织一九五九年农业生产大跃进的主要工作，向大会简要汇报。
    一九五八年是全面大跃进的一年。在中国共产党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针指引下，经过全省人民的奋发努力，湖南省的工农业生产有了巨大的增长，其它国民经济和文化建设事业也取得了很大成就；人民公社化已在全省农村胜利实现；广大群众的生活水平显著提高；人民的思想面貌大为改观，共产主义精神蓬勃发扬；各级领导机关和干部对社会主义经济发展规律有了进一步的认识和体会，工作方法大有改进，党和群众的关系更加密切。在这个基础上，今年我省工农业生产，正迈开大步，继续跃进，一个新的工农业生产高潮正在健康地向前发展。
    组织今年农业生产的继续大跃进，是广大群众的迫切要求和强烈愿望。把广大群众继续跃进的要求和愿望集中起来，把广大群众的积极性充分地调动起来，就要着重解决群众在前进道路上迫切需要解决的问题。我们正是与群众商量来进行这些工作的。
    实行计划用粮  大受群众欢迎
    群众的干劲越大，越是要关心群众的生活，越是关心群众的生活，群众的干劲就越大。去年的大跃进是这样做的，组织今年生产的再跃进，仍然要这样做。去年丰收之后，全省人民大炼钢铁，当时我们着重抓生产，对粮食管理注意不够，以致群众吃粮用粮过多了一些，浪费粮食的现象相当普遍，个别地方还相当严重。由于收成太好，人们在心理上就容易忽视计划用粮，以为“反正有的是，浪费一点没关系”，殊不知我国是一个有六亿多人口的大国，每人只要浪费一点点，积累起来，就是一个惊人的数字。在钢铁任务完成之后，根据中央关心群众生活的指示和群众合理用粮的要求，我们首先就加强了粮食管理工作。春耕农忙，群众吃饱吃好，是保持充沛干劲和坚强体力的前提，经过细致摸底，我们决定从四月一日起，到接新为止，全省农村人口平均每人每月保证供应四十斤原粮。据最近较精确的统计，全省一千一百一十二个人民公社，基本上都是按照四十斤标准供应的。虽然有些地方，如湘西、黔阳、常德等地区，每人每月仍然有吃到五、六十斤的。但也有七十六个公社，由于地区边僻，运输困难，过去用粮过多，暂时只有三十五斤至三十七、八斤的，只要对春收作物加强培育管理，多种瓜菜，精打细算，这七十六个公社的口粮供应也是完全可以保证的。每个农民在过去所谓“青黄不接”的时候，平均每人每月保证供应四十斤粮食，这个标准，在湖南的历史上来说是空前的，是一件有伟大意义的事情。口粮问题如此合理安排，受到了广大群众的热烈拥护。许多群众，特别是三部分人，对此感触最深。他们说：“在青黄不接的时候能够吃到这么多的粮食，这是开天辟地不曾有过的事情。只有崭劲干，实现更大的跃进，才对得起党和政府。”这是全省农民心坎里的话，也是群众劳动积极性得以进一步发挥的巨大推动力。
    推广增产技术必须通过群众
    一九五八年的农业大丰收，是和先进技术措施的推广分不开的。在推广增产技术措施的工作上，我们有一条基本经验，就是必须通过群众，经过试验。春耕到来，群众在增产技术措施上最关切的问题是水稻密植问题。密植能够增产，这已为农业生产大跃进的事实所肯定而总结在“八字宪法”中的，从干部到群众已很少有人怀疑它的真实性了，问题是在密植的适当程度上，群众对此颇有争论，我们抓住这一关键性的问题，在全省范围内展开了一场群众性的关于水稻密植问题的大辩论。从辩论中，群众一致得出了如下的结论：合理密植的名声蛮好，要想增产，必须密植；但是密植的程度和规格必须根据自然条件和耕作技术条件的实际情况，因时、因地制宜，同时还要采用综合的技术措施。广大群众对于密植的规格十分关心，和农民谈话，接触到这个问题，就议论纷纷，半天还收不得场。浏阳大瑶公社干部开会，群众积极打听关于密植规格的消息。有的干部说：“只有土改划阶级时才这样关心过”。群众这种关切的心情，反映了他们对实现大跃进的强烈责任感，也反映了他们争取大丰收的渴望。很多群众和劳动模范的意见是：不管密植到什么程度，总归一条是要田里能够去得人，能够?得禾，这样，水稻才会很好地发蔸，分蘖，禾根才能够充分地吸收肥分。我们就是根据这些意见来规定密植的限度的。
    按照中共中央八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的精神，我们在全省人民公社中进行了整顿、巩固、提高的工作，已经获得了显著的成效。对于今年春耕生产的准备工作，诸如水利、积肥、深耕、种子饲料以及劳动力的安排等等，我们都较往年抓得早，抓得细致。现在，全省早稻插秧已经全面结束，我们已为实现今年农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进打开了胜利的局面。我们相信，在中央的领导下，在总路线的指导下，只要我们继续发扬群众路线的工作作风，遇事和群众商量，紧密依靠群众，抓住时间，一着不让，一步不松，我们就一定能够排除万难，将今年农业生产的计划指标变为光辉的现实。
