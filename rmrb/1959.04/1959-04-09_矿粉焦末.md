    Mineral Powder and Coke Breeze
    Since the entire Party and all the people have been vigorously developing the steel industry since last year, a large amount of mineral powder, coke breeze, and limestone powder has accumulated on the construction sites of blast furnaces in various places. How to fully utilize these mineral powders and coke powders for iron smelting has become a pressing issue that needs to be resolved. The news of Hefei City's steel plants producing sintered ore sets an example for fully utilizing mineral powder for iron smelting.

    According to statistics from relevant departments, generally about 15% of mineral powder is left behind during the crushing and processing of ore, which cannot be directly put into the furnace for smelting. It may not seem like a large amount, but when many 15% portions are combined, the quantity becomes very large. Take Hefei City as an example! Hefei City does not have too many steel plants, but since the vigorous development of the steel industry last year, it has accumulated more than 25,000 tons of mineral powder. Calculated at an 83% sintering rate, this can produce more than 20,700 tons of sintered ore. Based on the current actual ore consumption of small blast furnaces in Hefei City, this sintered ore can supply the city's small blast furnaces for more than a month. Extrapolating from this, if all steel plants across the country could utilize all mineral powder, one can imagine that the quantity would be considerable.

    We hope that all steel plants will pay attention to Hefei City's experience in producing sintered ore and fully utilize all mineral powder and coke powder.

    矿粉焦末
    自去年全党全民大办钢铁工业以来，各地高炉工地上积存了大批矿粉、焦粉和石灰石粉，如何充分利用这些矿粉焦粉炼铁，已成为目前迫切需要解决的问题。合肥市各钢铁厂生产烧结矿的消息，为充分利用矿粉炼铁树立了榜样。
    据有关部门统计，矿石在破碎加工的过程中，一般要遗留下15％左右的矿粉，不能直接入炉冶炼。看起来数量并不大，但是，把许多15％集中起来，其数量就会变得很大了。就以合肥市为例吧！合肥市的钢铁厂并不算太多，但是自去年大办钢铁工业以来，已积存了矿粉达两万五千多吨，按83％的结矿率计算，就可以生产出两万零七百多吨烧结矿。按目前合肥市小高炉实际使用的矿石计算，这些烧结矿可供全市小高炉生产一个多月。推而广之，如果全国各个钢铁厂都能把所有的矿粉利用起来，可以设想到，其数量是相当可观的。
    我们希望所有的钢铁厂注意合肥市搞烧结矿的经验，把所有的矿粉和焦粉都充分利用起来。
