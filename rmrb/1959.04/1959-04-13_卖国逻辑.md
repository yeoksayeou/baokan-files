    Logic of Betraying the Country

    The news that the United States wanted to establish intermediate-range missile bases in Italy immediately aroused strong opposition from the Italian people. Italian Foreign Minister Pella, both annoyed and panicked, clamored recklessly: he would rather have Italy suffer atomic destruction than be ruled by the Communist Party.

    Pella made this determination to his American masters in New York. Reactionaries are truly alike, and the logic of traitors is also the same. China once had the Empress Dowager Cixi of the last dynasty and the later Kuomintang traitors who shouted: "Rather give it to foreign friends than to domestic slaves." Unexpectedly, in the past, Chinese reactionaries always learned from Western reactionaries, but now the Western reactionary Foreign Minister Pella wants to follow in the footsteps of Chinese reactionaries.

    However, Pella has gone a step further. Giving it to "foreign friends" still allows one to be a slave; but to bring about atomic destruction, isn't that wanting to die? But the people cannot be destroyed by any weapons, and Italy will definitely belong to the Italian people.

    卖国逻辑
    美国要在意大利建立中程导弹基地的消息传出后，立即引起了意大利人民的强烈反对。意大利外长贝拉又恼怒又慌张，竟不顾一切地叫嚷：他宁愿让意大利遭受原子毁灭，也不愿让它受共产党的统治。
    贝拉是在纽约向美国主人表白这个决心的。反动派真是无独有偶，卖国者的逻辑也是相同的。中国就曾有过末代王朝的慈禧太后和后来的国民党卖国贼叫喊：“宁赠友邦，勿与家奴”。想不到过去总是中国反动派向西洋反动派学舌，而今却是西洋反动派贝拉外长要蹈中国反动派的复辙了。
    不过，贝拉更进了一步。赠了“友邦”，犹可自当奴才；而竟要招来原子毁灭，岂非自己不想活命么。但人民是任何武器毁灭不了的，意大利肯定是意大利人民的。
