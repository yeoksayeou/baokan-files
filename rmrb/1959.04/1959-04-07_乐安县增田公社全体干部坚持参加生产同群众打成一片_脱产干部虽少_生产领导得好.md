Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Electric Dispatch: The entire cadre of the Zengtian People's Commune in Le'an County, Jiangxi, adheres to the system of participating in production and leading production, integrating with the masses. With relatively few cadres released from production, they lead the commune's production very well.

The Zengtian People's Commune was established on October 1st last year, with a total of 2,513 households and over 9,600 people. Thirty-one cadres are released from production, accounting for three per thousand of the total population of the commune.

After the establishment of the commune, the commune Party committee determined that each cadre must participate in 90 days of production labor each year. The methods are: rotating to production teams to be a commune member for one month, eating, living, and working with the commune members; laboring with the commune members wherever they inspect production; cultivating experimental fields. Each time a cadre goes to a team or group to work, they must conduct in-depth visits with at least three to five commune members or families. The ten members of the commune Party committee usually each make three to five friends among the commune members as the base point for contacting the masses; each time they go to a team, they must hold one or two small symposiums with three to five commune members. Throughout the year, each cadre must spend more than 85% of their time delving into teams, groups, and fields, with the remaining time spent in the commune researching and arranging work. After a cadre's term as a commune member expires, it must be assessed by the commune members; cadres usually labor with the commune members, and the commune members evaluate their work and record points; the Party committee conducts monthly inspections and quarterly evaluations, selecting model cadres and advanced workers based on the opinions of the commune members and posting them publicly.

Since the implementation of these systems, all cadres have spent an average of about 25 days each month living among the masses. In particular, the cadres' leading participation in production has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the commune members. The commune's various production tasks, such as autumn harvest and planting, winter production, and spring plowing preparation, have been completed quickly and well. The spring plowing production campaign currently underway is at the forefront of the entire county.

Because the cadres' work style is thorough, problems in work and production can be quickly discovered and resolved. When Guan Qingjiao, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, and Jiang Wenpin, a member of the Party Committee, were inspecting production in the Shibei Management Area, they held a small symposium. The commune members pointed out that the pig farm was located on the mountain and was too cold, which was not suitable. After discussing this issue with the cadres of the management area, it was resolved that day. Yang Donghua, the First Secretary of the Party Committee, found that some seedling fields did not meet the specifications when he participated in production in the Fangyuan Management Area, so he led the commune members to modify the seedling fields; after returning to the commune, he used the phone to notify each production team leader to inspect them once, so that all the seedling fields in the commune reached the standard of new-style seedling fields.

The relationship between the cadres and the masses in this commune is very close, united and as close as family. Li Shengyuan, a member of the Party Committee, was once working with commune members when it suddenly rained heavily. He immediately gave his bamboo hat to a commune member who did not have one. When Yang Donghua, the First Secretary of the Party Committee, visited a commune member's family, he found that Chen Lianzhi was ill, so he personally invited a doctor to examine and treat him, which quickly cured his illness. The commune members reflected that the cadres now have "five haves": they have soaring enthusiasm, they have work bases, they have typical experiences, they have a hard-working and thorough work style, and they have inventions and creations. Moreover, they have achieved "five goods": they complete tasks well, they implement policies well, they contact the masses well, they do ideological work well, and they labor well.

    乐安县增田公社全体干部坚持参加生产同群众打成一片
    脱产干部虽少　生产领导得好
    据新华社南昌电　江西乐安县增田人民公社全体干部坚持参加生产领导生产的制度，同群众打成一片，在脱产干部较少的情况下，把全社生产领导得很好。
    增田人民公社在去年10月1日成立，共有二千五百一十三户，九千六百多人。脱产干部三十一人，占全社总人数的千分之三。
    公社成立后，公社党委就确定每个干部每年必须参加九十天生产劳动。方式是轮流到生产队当一个月社员，与社员同吃同住同劳动；到哪里检查生产就在哪里和社员一起劳动；种试验田。每个干部每次下队下组工作时，至少要深入访问三、五个社员或家庭。公社党委的十个委员，平时每人都交三户到五户朋友，作为自己联系群众的基点；每人每次下队都要召开一两次有三、五名社员参加的小型座谈会。全年每个干部必须有85％以上的时间深入到队、组、田间，其余时间在公社研究布置工作。干部当社员期满以后，要经过社员群众鉴定；干部平常和社员一起劳动，由社员评工记分；党委会一月一检查、一季一评比，根据社员的意见评选模范干部、先进工作者，列榜公布。
    这些制度实行以来，全体干部平均每个月都有二十五天左右的时间生活在群众中。特别是干部带头参加生产，大大激发了社员们的干劲。全社秋收秋种、冬季生产和备耕等各项生产任务，都完成得既快又好。目前正在开展的春耕生产运动又走在全县的最前列。
    由于干部作风深入，工作中和生产中的一些问题就能很快发现，很快解决。公社党委副书记管清姣和党委委员姜文品在石背管理区检查生产时，开了一次小型座谈会，社员当时提出养猪场设在山上太冷，不适合。这个问题经和管理区干部研究以后，当天就得到了解决。党委第一书记杨冬华在方元管理区参加生产中发现部分秧田不合规格，便带领社员改做了秧田；回社后又用电话通知各生产队长检查一次，使全社的秧田丘丘都达到了新式秧田的标准。
    这个公社干部和群众的关系很密切，团结一致，亲似家人。党委委员李生员有一次和社员一同劳动，忽然天下暴雨，他立即把自己的斗笠送给没有斗笠的社员戴。党委第一书记杨冬华在一次访问社员家庭时，发现社员陈连之得了病，便亲自请来医生给他检查和治疗，使他很快治好了病。社员们反映，干部现在做到了“五有”：有冲天干劲，有工作基点，有典型经验，有艰苦深入作风，有发明创造，而且做到了“五好”：完成任务好，执行政策好，联系群众好，思想工作好，劳动好。
