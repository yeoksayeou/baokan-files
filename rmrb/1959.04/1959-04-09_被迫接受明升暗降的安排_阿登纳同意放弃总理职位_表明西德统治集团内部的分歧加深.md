Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 8th Dispatch: The leading body of the West German ruling party, the Christian Democratic Union, unanimously passed a resolution on the 7th, nominating Adenauer as a candidate for the West German presidential election to be held in July this year. Adenauer has already expressed his agreement to this decision.

Some Western news agencies reported that this decision by the leading body of the Christian Democratic Union was tantamount to "kicking Adenauer upstairs," greatly diminishing his real power to manipulate West German politics. The West German constitution stipulates that the president is merely a nominal position, and the real power to decide the country's major policies lies with the chancellor, not the president.

Sources say that Adenauer's party has been asking him to agree to be a presidential candidate for weeks, even months, but this request has been resolutely rejected by Adenauer. At a meeting of 55 leaders of the Christian Democratic Union held on the 7th, this suggestion was raised again and was "immediately" and "unanimously" endorsed. Adenauer initially requested time to consider, but these leaders did not wait for Adenauer's decision and unanimously voted to make the decision. Adenauer agreed to the decision after "contemplating for two and a half hours."

Adenauer's nomination as a West German presidential candidate has attracted widespread attention in Bonn and in Western capitals. Bonn sources believe that Adenauer's impending loss of the position of chancellor and also the leader of the Christian Democratic Union indicates that his rigid policies pursued over the years have isolated him within his own party.

Since the Soviet Union recently proposed that East and West hold negotiations to resolve the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue, Adenauer has been doing everything possible to obstruct a serious and realistic attitude towards negotiations with the Soviet Union. This stubborn attitude has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among public opinion at home and abroad in West Germany, thus deepening the divisions within the West German ruling group.

Officials in the United States, Britain, and France have not yet issued formal comments on this matter. However, according to reports from Western newspapers and news agencies, officials in Washington expressed "shock" at the decision of the West German Christian Democratic Union because they believe that Adenauer is America's "most loyal friend on the European continent and a major advocate of taking a tough line against the Soviet Union." The French side also expressed "disappointment," believing that de Gaulle and Adenauer have recently been "in agreement" on many international issues. In Britain, where public opinion has been criticizing Adenauer recently, the reaction has been to express "happiness."

    被迫接受明升暗降的安排
    阿登纳同意放弃总理职位
    表明西德统治集团内部的分歧加深
    新华社8日讯　波恩消息：西德执政党基督教民主联盟的领导机构7日一致通过决定，提名阿登纳为今年7月举行的西德总统选举的候选人，阿登纳已经表示同意这一决定。
    某些西方通讯社报道说，基督教民主联盟领导机构这一决定无异把阿登纳“踢到楼上去”，使阿登纳大大丧失操纵西德政治的实权。西德宪法规定，总统只是一个有名无实的职位，决定国家大政方针的实权操在总理而不是总统手里。
    有消息说，阿登纳的党好几个星期、甚至好几个月来就要求阿登纳答应当总统候选人，但是这个要求一直遭到阿登纳的坚决拒绝。7日举行的基督教民主联盟五十五名领导人的一次会议再次提出了这一建议，并且“立即”得到“完全一致的”赞同。阿登纳起初要求给予时间考虑，但是这些领导人没有等待阿登纳考虑的结果就一致投票作出了决定，阿登纳在“沉思两个半小时”以后同意了这个决定。
    阿登纳被提名为西德总统候选人一事在波恩以及在西方国家的首都引起了广泛注意。波恩人士认为，阿登纳即将失去总理、同时也失去基督教民主联盟领袖的地位，表明他多年来奉行的僵硬政策已使他自己在他党内陷于孤立。
    在苏联最近提出关于东西方举行谈判解决缔结对德和约和西柏林问题以后，阿登纳一直在用尽心机阻挠采取认真和现实的态度同苏联谈判。这种顽固不化的态度引起了西德国内外舆论的普遍不满，因而也加深了西德统治集团内部的分歧。
    美、英、法官方目前对这一件事还没有发表正式评论。但是据西方报刊和通讯社的报道，华盛顿的官员们对西德基督教民主联盟的决定表示“震惊”，因为他们认为阿登纳是美国“在西欧大陆上一个最忠实的朋友和主张对苏联采取强硬政策的主要鼓吹人”。法国方面也表示“失望”，认为戴高乐和阿登纳最近在许多国际问题上都是“意见一致”的。在近来舆论对阿登纳一直进行抨击的英国，反应却是表示“高兴”。
