Xinhua News Agency, 12th - Currently, wheat growth in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins is entering a decisive period, and spring plowing and planting have reached a stage of intense activity. At a telephone conference on wheat field management and spring plowing and planting held on the evening of April 10th by the Ministry of Agriculture with eight provinces and cities including Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, a call was issued to all localities to further improve the late-stage field management of wheat, especially to do a good job in preventing lodging, topdressing fertilizer, preventing diseases and insect pests, preventing frost, and preventing waterlogging, in order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest, and to solidly carry out spring plowing and planting work, completing the planting tasks in a timely manner.

At the meeting, the heads of the agricultural departments of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces reported on the current wheat growth situation, the existing problems and the measures taken, and also reported on the current spring plowing and planting situation and the existing problems. After listening to the reports from these provinces, the meeting concluded that all localities have been paying close attention to wheat field management, and the wheat is growing better than in any previous year, making a bumper harvest very promising; the preparations for spring plowing and planting in all localities have been more thorough and solid than in previous years because they were grasped early, tightly, and well.

The meeting pointed out that in the area of wheat field management, all localities must further and effectively grasp and resolve the following issues: First of all, there must be no slackening in wheat field management, and there must be no relaxation of late-stage field management simply because the wheat seedlings are currently growing well. Large areas of high-yield fields must be allowed to be fully fed and watered again, striving for uniform heading and large, grain-filled ears. Third-class seedlings must be given extra topdressing and watering to promote their catching up. Overcoming wheat lodging is an important link in striving for a bumper harvest, and the main methods are pruning leaves, thinning seedlings, applying more plant ash and phosphate-potash fertilizer, controlling the application of nitrogen fertilizer, and controlling watering. In addition, attention should be paid to preventing diseases and insect pests, preventing frost, and preventing waterlogging. Currently, in addition to rust, some places have also experienced insect pests such as wheat midges, wheat aphids, and wheat mites. All localities should organize forces to detect and eliminate them at any time. In areas north of the Huai River and in the Yellow River basin, frost may occur, and all localities must prepare for frost prevention.

In terms of spring plowing and planting, the meeting required all localities to complete the spring plowing and planting tasks in a timely manner. To complete this task, the following work must be done well:

First, all localities must ensure the completion of the planned planting area. In spring planting, we should also pay attention to planting more spring oil crops in order to ensure the completion of this year's oil production tasks. Potato planting must still be emphasized to ensure the completion of this year's planned planting area. Second, adjust the labor force and strengthen the forces on the spring plowing and planting front to ensure the timely completion of the tense spring planting tasks. Spring planting is not good if it is too early or too late, only timely is best. Third, for spring planting land that has not been plowed, efforts should be organized to plow it, and spring crops should be planted on the plowed land. Fourth, if the fertilizer on the spring planting land is insufficient, time should be seized to accumulate and create fertilizer so that the rationally and densely planted crops can get enough nutrients. Fifth, attention should be paid to carefully selecting seeds.

The meeting was chaired by Gu Dachuan, Vice Minister of Agriculture. The heads of the agricultural departments of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui and Beijing participated in the meeting.

　　蓬蓬勃勃扎扎实实
　　加强麦田管理　抓紧春播工作
　　八省市电话会议提出当前农业战线的紧要任务
    新华社12日讯　目前，长江流域和黄河流域的小麦生长进入决定性的时期，春耕春播到了紧张大忙的阶段。农业部在4月10日晚召开的河南、河北、山东等八省市小麦田间管理、春耕春播电话会议上，号召各地进一步作好小麦后期田间管理工作，特别是做好防倒伏、追肥、防病虫害、防霜冻和防涝，争取小麦大丰收，扎扎实实地作好春耕春播工作，适时地完成播种任务。
    会上，河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西、江苏、安徽省农业厅局长汇报了当前小麦生长的情况，存在的问题和采取的措施，还汇报了当前春耕春播的情况和存在的问题。会议在听取了这些省的汇报后认为：各地对小麦田间管理工作抓得紧，麦子比以往任何一年生长得都好，丰收很有希望；各地对春耕春播的准备由于抓得早、抓得紧、抓得好，准备得比往年充分、扎实。
    会议指出各地在小麦的田间管理工作方面，必须进一步很好地抓紧解决如下几个问题：首先，在麦田管理工作上，不能松劲，绝不能看到目前麦苗生长得好，就放松后期田间管理。大面积丰产田要让它再次吃饱喝足，力争抽穗整齐，穗大粒多。三类苗田要格外追肥浇水，促使赶上来。战胜小麦倒伏是争取丰收的重要一环，主要办法是剪叶、疏苗、增施草木灰和磷钾肥、控制施氮肥和控制浇水等。此外还要注意防病虫害、防霜冻、防涝。目前情况，除锈病外，有的地方还发生了吸浆虫、麦蚜虫、麦蜘蛛等虫害，各地要组织力量，随时发现随时消灭。淮河以北和黄河流域地区，将可能出现霜冻，各地必须作好防霜冻的准备工作。
    在春耕春播方面，会议要求各地适时地完成春耕春播任务。完成这一任务要做好如下的工作：
    第一，各地要保证完成播种面积计划。在春播中还要注意多种一些春油料作物，以便保证完成今年油料的生产任务。薯类种植仍须重视，保证今年种植面积计划的完成。第二，调整劳动力，加强春耕春播战线上的力量，以保证适时地完成紧张的春播任务。春播过早过迟都不好，只有适时为最好。第三，春播地没有耕翻的，要组织力量进行耕翻，要把春播作物种植在耕翻过的土地上。第四，春播地肥料不足的，要抓紧时间积肥、造肥，使合理密植的作物得到足够的养料。第五，种子要注意精选。
    会议由农业部副部长顾大川主持。参加会议的有河南、河北、山东、陕西、山西、江苏、安徽和北京市农业厅局长。
