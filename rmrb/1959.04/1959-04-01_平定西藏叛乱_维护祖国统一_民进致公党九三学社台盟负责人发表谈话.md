    **China Association for Promoting Democracy**

    The spokesperson of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a statement on the Tibetan rebellion, saying that all members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy resolutely support all measures taken by the State Council to quell the Tibetan rebellion and unanimously condemn the heinous crimes of the Tibetan reactionaries in betraying the motherland.

    The spokesperson said: Safeguarding national unity and consolidating ethnic solidarity are the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in our country. However, a small handful of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet dared to tear up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, collude with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and instigate armed rebellion, completely violating the interests of the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. Such criminal behavior is absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country.

    The spokesperson said: Imperialism and all reactionaries are not reconciled to their defeat and are trying every possible means to create subversive activities and split China. However, the tricks of imperialism and all reactionaries are always futile. History dictates that they are bound to perish, and the powerful Chinese people are fully capable of crushing any conspiracy of imperialism.

    The spokesperson also said: The Tibetan traitorous group is a disgrace to the nation. The shameful failure of their rebellious behavior will promote the consolidation of national unity and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

    **China Zhi Gong Party**

    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, issued a statement supporting the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and completely quell the Tibetan rebellion.

    He said that since the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government signed the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet in 1951, the people of the whole country have warmly welcomed the agreement and celebrated that the Tibetan compatriots would gradually be liberated through the implementation of this agreement, and the unity of all ethnic groups in the country would increase day by day. However, the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique acted in defiance of the agreement, obstructing its implementation in various ways. They regarded the Central Government's expectations and care for the Tibetan local government as weakness and vulnerability and dared to collude with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and foreign reactionaries, openly tearing up the Seventeen-Article Agreement, launching an armed rebellion, and launching a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa. This is a heinous and unforgivable act.

    He, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Zhi Gong Party, firmly supported the State Council's order to quell the Lhasa rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government, and expressed his respect to the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet.

    Chen Qiyou expressed his utmost indignation at the criminal acts of the Tibetan rebel group in colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries. He said: The People's Republic of China is as solid as a rock, and these sinister attempts will be completely defeated.

    **Jiusan Society**

    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, issued a statement today on the Tibetan rebellion.

    Xu Deheng said: The treasonous crimes of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group in colluding with imperialism, gathering bandits, and openly tearing up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and launching an armed rebellion, are intolerable to the people of the whole country. We express our utmost indignation at this. The wise and decisive measures taken by the State Council to safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity are entirely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and the wishes of the people of the whole country. I, on behalf of all members of the Jiusan Society, express my full support and pay our highest respect to the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet who are suppressing the rebellion.

    Xu Deheng said: The swift suppression of the rebellion by the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet has once again declared the bankruptcy of the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group; it has once again proved the strength and consolidation of our country. Through this incident, we have further recognized the truth that imperialism and all reactionaries are bound to perish, and that peace, democracy, and socialism are bound to triumph.

    **Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League**

    Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. The spokesperson of the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a statement on the 29th, saying that the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group colluded with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek group, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and openly launched an armed rebellion. This is an act of treason that betrays the motherland and undermines national unity. The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League fully supports the State Council's order to thoroughly quell the rebellion in the Tibet region, dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion, and have the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercise the functions of the local government.

    The spokesperson of the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League pointed out that the act of the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet and the Tibetan local government in betraying the motherland is contrary to the will of the Tibetan people and also contrary to the interests of the Tibetan people. The armed rebellion of a small handful of reactionary groups in Tibet has completely exposed their ferocious and traitorous faces. Contrary to the wishes of the Tibetan reactionary group, their rebellion not only suffered a shameful failure, but also promoted the rebirth of the Tibetan people and the democratization of Tibet, and promoted the consolidation of national unity.

    The spokesperson said: "Our people will never allow imperialists and foreign reactionaries to interfere in our internal affairs. The Chiang Kai-shek group's call for so-called 'continued effective assistance' is also bound to suffer a shameful defeat. We, the Taiwan compatriots, must fight to the end to safeguard national unity and to liberate Taiwan."
