　　In summer, the sun on the Kangzang Plateau is very strong. After several days of marching, the survey team members' faces were sunburned black and red, and some even peeled. When we surveyed to the edge of a large gully in the Nyainqêntanglha Mountains, we stopped. Captain Shi Ying took gifts to visit nearby herders. An old Tibetan man warmly received us. The old man's hair was all white, his forehead was bald, his face was full of wrinkles, and his back was a little hunched. This old shepherd was Luo Beishangjin, who later helped the survey team find coal. He had run all over the large and small mountains in this area, and he was even familiar with every stone in every gully. After the captain explained the purpose of our visit, the old man took out a piece of black, shiny stone from his leather bag and promised to lead the team to find it the next day.

　　The large gully was like a snake, winding and extending to the top of the mountain. Its changing shape blocked people's view, and large rocks blocked our way, so we had to walk slowly. The higher we went, the narrower the valley became, and the steeper the mountains became. The mountain peaks stood in a chaotic jumble. We followed the old shepherd up one hill after another, but we didn't find anything. Should we return to the camp? We would have to come again tomorrow, and this journey would have been in vain. Should we camp here? We didn't have tents or food. Shi Ying discussed it with technician Xiao Zhang and consulted the geological workers. Everyone agreed to camp here.

　　We gathered some firewood and lit a bonfire, sitting around and chatting. The wilderness was quiet, and only the gurgling sound of a stream could be heard from somewhere. The old shepherd sat on the side, watching the young men busying themselves, touching this and that. He suddenly remembered that the survey team members had eaten all their food, so he quickly took out his tsampa bag and insisted that the team members eat some....

　　Before dawn, we were all awakened by the cold. Everyone packed up their tools and continued to head towards the Nyainqêntanglha Mountains.

　　A gust of wind happened to blow in our faces. The higher we climbed, the more difficult it became to breathe. But in order to find coal, the comrades mustered their courage and climbed upwards, wishing they could take one step to the location of the coal mine. Old man Luo Beishangjin also encouraged everyone, saying, "Almost there! Keep going!" He always walked in front of everyone, looking around like he was searching for a beloved lost yak, and he was also very anxious. He would often look back at the team members, afraid that the young men were tired, and he would ask everyone to sit down and rest, and then continue.... In the afternoon, we reached a higher mountain peak. Looking back, the road was rugged and uneven. At this time, we saw a black mass on the northwest slope. The old shepherd led everyone to it. Shi Ying could no longer suppress the excitement in his heart, and said repeatedly, "Good coal! Good coal!" He also asked the old shepherd to help mobilize some people to help dig.

　　The next day, the old shepherd went to his neighbors to find the young men. At first, the young men were unwilling to come. The old shepherd told them, "If we find treasure, we will live a good life. Think about it, who are the geological team members working hard for so far away from their families?"

　　"That's right! But we're busy!" Yideng's mother said.

　　Yideng shouted, "But, Mother, who are they working hard for after walking thousands of miles?!" Mother finally agreed.

　　In this way, after the old shepherd's mobilization, more than a dozen young men were gathered. The next day, before dawn, they set off for the mountains.

　　In a few days, rows of trenches and pits appeared on the hillside, and the black coal shone with an attractive light. The old shepherd often encouraged the young men, saying, "Work hard! We will soon no longer have to burn yak dung." This afternoon, it was windy and snowy on and off. The old shepherd led the young men in singing folk songs, continuing to swing their hoes.

　　When the young men on the team saw how enthusiastic the Tibetan compatriots were, they worked even harder alongside them. They thought, "For these simple and hardworking people, we should work a hundred times harder."

    老牧人
    云峰
    夏天，康藏高原上的太阳非常强烈，经过几天的行军，普查队员们的脸晒得又黑又红，有的还脱了一层皮。当我们踏勘到念青唐古拉的一条大沟口边，就停下来了。石英队长带着礼品到附近牧民家里去访问。一位藏族老人热情地接待了我们。老人的头发都白了，前额光光的，脸上堆满了皱纹，背也有些驼了。这位老牧人，就是后来帮助普查队员找到了煤的罗贝上金。他赤着足跑遍了这一带大大小小的山头，甚至每条沟里的每块石头他都熟悉。当队长说明来意后，老人从皮袋中掏出一块黑色闪光的石块，并答应第二天领队员们去找它。
    大沟像条蛇，弯曲的伸延到山顶，它的多变的外形挡住了人们的视线，大块的石头阻塞了我们的去路，只好慢慢行走。越往上河谷越窄，山势越陡，山头错乱丛立，我们随着老牧人登上一个个的山丘，但是啥也没有找到。返回营地吗？明天还得再来，这段路就白跑了；在这儿宿营吗？没有帐篷，也没有饭吃。石英就和技术员小张研究，并征求地质工人的意见，大家都同意在这儿露营。
    我们拾些柴燃起篝火，围着谈天。山野静静的，只有不知什么地方的溪水发出潺潺的声音。老牧人坐在一边，看着小伙子弄弄这，摸摸那，他忽然想起，普查队员带的东西都吃光了，便赶紧把他的糌粑口袋拿出来，非要让队员吃不可……。
    不到天亮，我们都被冻醒了。大家收拾一下工具，又继续朝念青唐古拉走去。
    恰好迎面吹来一阵大风，越往上爬，使人感到呼吸更加困难。但是为了找到煤，同志们鼓起勇气向上爬，恨不得一步就迈到煤矿所在地。罗贝上金老人也鼓励大家说：“快到了！ 加油呀！”他始终走在大家的前面，像寻找丢失了心爱的牦牛一样，东张西望，心里也很焦急，他不时回头望望队员们，怕小伙子们走累，便叫大家坐下来休息休息，然后再走……。午后我们已到达一个较高的山头。回顾来路崎岖不平。这时我们就看到西北坡上一片黑压压的东西，老牧人领着大伙奔去。石英再也压制不住内心的激动，连声说：“好煤呀！好煤呀！”他并请求老牧人帮助动员一些人，来帮忙挖一挖。
    第二天，老牧人便到邻居家去找小伙子们了。起初小伙子们不愿来。老牧人便告诉他们：“找到宝，我们就会过好日子了，你们再想想，地质队员远离亲人是为了谁啊？”
    “这话对呀！可是我们忙啊！”伊登的阿妈说。
    伊登嚷着道：“可是，阿妈，他们走了几千里路又是为谁忙啊？！”阿妈终于也同意了。
    就这样，经过老牧人的动员，召集了十几名小伙子。第二天，天麻麻亮，他们就朝山里进发了。
    不几天，山坡上就出现了一排排槽子和坑，乌黑的煤块发出诱人的光亮。老牧人经常鼓励小伙子们说：“使劲干吧！咱们快要不烧牛粪了。”这天下午，时停时起的刮着风雪，老牧人领着小伙子们唱着民歌，继续挥动着锄头。
    队上的小伙子们，看见藏胞劲头这样大，也就更加努力地和藏胞一起干。他们想：“为了这些纯朴勤劳的人们，我们更应该百倍地去劳动。”
