Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 16th: German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl today delivered a statement on behalf of the government at a meeting of the People's Chamber. In his statement, Grotewohl put forward the basic guiding principles to be followed by the delegation of the German Democratic Republic participating in the Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in Geneva on May 11. These principles are:
    (1) The interests of the people of Germany and all other countries require the immediate conclusion of a German peace treaty. Therefore, the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference must focus its main attention on this issue and take all necessary measures to convene a peace conference without delay;
    (2) The situation in West Berlin must be clarified, as West Berlin has developed into a dangerous center of international tension, a development that seriously threatens peace. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is capable of making considerable progress in resolving this issue;
    (3) The European situation urgently requires measures to eliminate the danger of war. Suggestions of great importance are: the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, the reduction of foreign troops in other countries, especially in Germany, and measures that would further reduce the risk of a surprise attack in Europe;
    (4) The reunification of Germany is a matter for the two Germanys, and the Geneva Conference cannot discuss this issue, as that would constitute interference in Germany's internal affairs.
    In his statement, Grotewohl pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is pleased with the upcoming Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. He said that the convening of this conference, which aims to safeguard peace and eliminate international tensions, is the result of Soviet proposals and the support of various socialist countries.
    Grotewohl pointed out that the restoration of German unity should be achieved through the establishment of a confederation, which could guarantee the gradual rapprochement of the two Germanys. He said that since the West German government is unwilling to take the path of establishing a confederation, the only other way is to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys.
    Grotewohl pointed out that the situation in which the German people have not had a peace treaty for fourteen years after the end of the war must end. He hoped that the Foreign Ministers' Conference would consider this legitimate desire of the German people.
    Speaking on the Berlin issue, Grotewohl emphasized that the proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on this issue have only one purpose, namely to eliminate the "Cold War" base in West Berlin. On this issue, he refuted the proposals to establish some form of control over the entire city of Berlin, considering these proposals to be unfounded.
    Grotewohl spoke of the great efforts made by the government of the German Democratic Republic to agree on a unified German view on the issue of the peace treaty. He called on the government of the Federal Republic of Germany not to oppose the growing desire for peace and security among the masses of the West German people, and he stated that the government of the German Democratic Republic is prepared to negotiate with representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany in order to agree on a unified position at the Geneva Conference.
    While addressing the People's Chamber, Grotewohl announced the list of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic participating in the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. The head of the delegation is Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Bolz (National Democratic Party). The delegation members include: Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Wenzel (Socialist Unity Party of Germany), State Secretary Dr. Toeplitz (Christian Democratic Union), Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Standing Committee of the People's Chamber Florin, and some responsible officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 15th: Czechoslovak President and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Novotný, said at a mass meeting in Ostrava this afternoon: We welcome the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference in Geneva and believe that the results of the conference will help to ease international tensions.
    In his speech, Novotný, commenting on the Soviet proposals for concluding a German peace treaty and resolving the Berlin issue, considered this to be the most pressing task at present, a task that will solve the problem of defending peace in Europe and eliminating the forces of war now being cultivated in West Germany. The peaceful efforts of the Soviet Union and friendly countries are gaining further understanding in the world. He said that the anti-war public opinion in the United States, France, Britain, and even within West Germany, is so strong today that the governments concerned must (at least on the surface) respect this public opinion.

　　格罗提渥在德意志民主共和国议会上发表声明
　　东西方外长会议应致力解决对德和约问题
　　诺沃提尼说缔结对德和约是目前最迫切的任务
    新华社柏林16日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥今天在人民议院的会议上代表政府发表了一项声明。格罗提渥在声明中提出了参加将于5月11日在日内瓦举行的外长会议的德意志民主共和国代表团所应遵循的基本指导原则。这些原则是：
    （1）德国和所有其他国家的人民的利益要求立即缔结对德和约。因此，日内瓦外长会议必须将其主要着眼点放在这一问题上，并为毫不拖延地召开和会采取一切必要的措施；
    （2）绝对必须澄清西柏林的局势，因为西柏林已发展成为国际紧张局势的危险中心，这种发展是对和平的严重威胁。外长会议是能够在解决这一问题上取得相当的进展的；
    （3）欧洲局势迫切要求采取措施以消除战争危险。具有巨大重要性的建议是：建立中欧无核武器区，北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织缔结互不侵犯条约，减少在其他国家、特别是在德国的外国军队，以及会进一步减少在欧洲发生突然袭击危险的措施；
    （4）德国的重新统一是两个德国的事情，日内瓦会议不能讨论这一问题，否则就是干涉德国内政。
    格罗提渥在声明中指出，德意志民主共和国对即将召开日内瓦外长会议表示满意。他说，这一旨在保障和平、消除国际紧张局势的会议之所以能够召开，是由于苏联的建议和各社会主义国家支持的结果。
    格罗提渥指出，恢复德国的统一应该通过建立邦联的途径来实现，邦联能够保证两个德国逐渐接近。他说，既然西德政府不愿意走建立邦联的道路，那末只得走另一条路——同两个德国缔结和约。
    格罗提渥指出，必须结束那种战争结束后十四年德国人民还没有和约的状况。他希望，外长会议会考虑德国人民的这个正当愿望。
    在谈到柏林问题时，格罗提渥着重指出，苏联和德意志民主共和国关于这个问题的建议只有一个目的，即消除西柏林的“冷战”基地。在这个问题上，他驳斥了关于对整个柏林建立某种管制的建议，认为这些建议是毫无根据的。
    格罗提渥谈到了德意志民主共和国政府为商定对和约问题的全德一致的观点而作的巨大努力。他要求德意志联邦共和国政府不要反对西德人民群众中日益增长的要求和平和安全的愿望，他并且表示，德意志民主共和国政府为了商定在日内瓦会议上的一致观点，准备同德意志联邦共和国代表进行谈判。
    格罗提渥在向人民议院发表声明时宣布了德意志民主共和国参加日内瓦外长会议的代表团名单。代表团团长是副总理兼外交部长博尔茨博士（国家民主党）。代表团团员包括：外交部副部长文策尔（德国统一社会党），国务秘书特普利茨博士（基督教民主联盟），人民议院外交常务委员会主席弗洛林和外交部的一些负责官员。
    新华社布拉格15日电　捷克斯洛伐克总统、捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼今天下午在俄斯特拉发的群众大会上说：我们欢迎即将在日内瓦举行的外长会议，相信会议的结果将有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。
    诺沃提尼在演说中评价苏联关于缔结对德和约和解决柏林问题的建议时认为，这是目前最迫切的任务，这个任务将解决保卫欧洲和平以及消除现在正在西德培植起来的战争势力的问题。苏联和友好国家的和平努力在世界上正在获得更进一步的了解。他说，美国、法国、英国甚至西德国内反对战争的舆论今天已经是这样的强烈，使得有关政府必须（至少在表面上）尊重这种舆论。
