    Time is the measure of labor productivity. Labor productivity is measured by the amount of product a person makes in a unit of time, or by the labor time used for a unit product. The more things are made in each day, each hour, each minute, each second, and the less labor time is spent on each product, the higher the labor productivity. Saving time and increasing labor productivity are the same thing. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Committee requires Shanghai workers to "do the work of one and a half people this year." This does not mean increasing everyone's working hours by half, but rather greatly saving labor time, so that the amount of product greatly increases in the same amount of time. In this way, the material wealth of society will become increasingly abundant, and the speed of building socialism will be greatly accelerated.

    Time is also the measure of a race. The less time it takes to reach the finish line, the faster the speed. Whoever wins time wins the victory. Therefore, when the judge's gun sounds, the only concept in the competitor's mind is time. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is engaged in a peaceful competition with the capitalist camp in economic construction. We are running harder and faster, while the imperialist countries are walking slower and slower, panting, weak, and unsteady. They are rotting day by day. The victory in the peaceful competition is already firmly in the hands of the socialist countries.

    Time is also the measure of history. The industrial revolution greatly saved labor time, enabling capitalism to achieve rapid development. Marx once said that the invention of the steam engine changed everything in the world in a very short period of time. However, the current dying capitalism is characterized by a large waste of labor time—social material wealth. Therefore, the day when capitalism withdraws from the stage of history is getting closer and closer.

    Time, for each person, is also the measure of life. Life is limited, but some people have done many things beneficial to the people in this limited time, while others have wasted their time in vain. If cherishing time means cherishing life, then the former is prolonging life, while the latter is impairing life. Great people are the most "stingy" with time. In their lives, they have created enormous material and spiritual wealth for mankind. Because this wealth will always serve mankind, their lives will also last forever with time. Therefore, "doing the work of one and a half people" means saving time and prolonging life for everyone.

    Therefore, we must cherish every minute and every second. In time, there is immeasurable wealth and endless power; in time, there is also our most precious life. (Excerpt from Shanghai "Liberation" No. 6, Yi Qun: "Ode to Time")

### 珍惜时间就是延长生命

    珍惜时间就是延长生命
    时间，是劳动生产率的尺度。劳动生产率是以人在单位时间内制造出的产品量，或是以用于单位产品的劳动时间来测量的，每日、每时、每分、每秒钟内制造出的东西愈多，每件产品内的劳动时间愈少，劳动生产率就愈高。节约时间和提高劳动生产率是同一回事情。所以上海市委要求上海工人今年“一个人做一个半人的事情”，并不是说要每个人增加一半的工作时间，而是要求大大节约劳动时间，使在同样的时间内，产品量大大地增加起来。这样，社会的物质财富就会日益丰富，建成社会主义的速度就会大大加快。
    时间，又是赛跑的尺度。跑到终点的时间愈少，速度就愈快，谁赢得了时间，谁就赢得了胜利。所以当评判员的枪声一响，竞赛者的头脑里，唯一的观念就是时间。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营正在经济建设上同资本主义阵营进行和平竞赛，我们越跑越起劲，越跑越快，帝国主义国家则越走越慢，气喘脚软，摇摆不稳，它们正在一天一天烂下去。和平竞赛中，胜利的左券，已经稳操在社会主义国家手中了。
    时间，也是历史的尺度。产业革命曾经大大地节约了劳动时间，使资本主义获得了飞跃的发展。马克思就曾说过，蒸汽机的发明，在很短时期就把世界万事万物都改变了。但是现时的已经垂死的资本主义，则表现为劳动时间——社会物质财富的大量浪费，所以资本主义退出历史舞台的日子，也越来越近了。
    时间，对每一个人说起来，又是生命的尺度。生命是有限的，但有些人在这有限的时间内做了许许多多有益于人民的事，有些人却白白浪费了光阴。如果爱惜时间就是爱惜生命的话，那末，前者就是在延长着生命，而后者却是在损折着生命。伟大的人物都是最“吝啬”时间的，在他们的一生中，为人类创造了巨大的物质和精神财富，由于这种财富永远地为人类服务着，于是他们的生命，也将与时间永存。所以，“一个人做一个半人的事情”，对每个人说来，是时间的节约，也就是生命的延长。
    所以，我们要珍惜每一分钟、每一秒钟时间。在时间里面，蕴藏着无量的财富，无穷的力量；在时间里，也蕴藏着我们最宝贵的生命。（摘自上海“解放”第六期，伊群：“时间颂”）
