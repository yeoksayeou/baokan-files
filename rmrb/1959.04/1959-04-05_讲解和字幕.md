　　Explanations and Subtitles
　　Qin Li
　　I went to listen to the Central Philharmonic Orchestra's Sunday concert. The content was very rich, including classical masterpieces by world-renowned composers Beethoven, Handel, and Haydn, as well as the first movement of "Symphony No. 1," a new work by the young Chinese composer Luo Zhongrong. However, what particularly interested and satisfied the audience was the conductor's vivid and brief explanation of the composer and the content of the music before each piece was played. This was indeed very helpful for audiences not yet familiar with symphonic music.
　　This made me think of the slide subtitles during opera performances. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, many theater troupes have been projecting the lyrics of the play using slides, so that the audience can clearly understand what the actors are singing. Some people have questioned whether this is necessary, but I think it is. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 300 types of opera in our country. Due to differences in language between the north, south, east, and west, the lyrics of each type of opera sound very different. People who are not familiar with a certain local dialect find it difficult to understand the opera from that place, which inevitably makes it difficult to grasp the plot and benefit from it.
　　As for symphonic music, many people are still unfamiliar with it, and more explanations are needed. Therefore, whether it is for foreign symphonic music or for colorful local operas, providing explanations and using subtitles is not a trivial matter. As an audience member, I thank the workers who are engaged in this beneficial work!

    讲解和字幕
    秦犁
    去听中央乐团星期音乐会的交响乐演出，内容很丰富，有世界著名作曲家贝多芬、韩德尔、海顿的古典名作，也有我国青年作曲家罗忠熔的新作“第一交响乐”的第一乐章。但特别使听众发生兴趣和满意的，是指挥在每个节目演奏之前，对作曲家和乐曲的内容作了一番生动而简短的讲解。这对还不大熟习交响乐的听众来说，的确很有好处。
    于是我想到戏曲演出时的幻灯字幕。去年大跃进以来，很多剧团在演出时，把剧中人的唱词用幻灯打出来，使观众清楚地知道演员正在唱什么。有人曾经怀疑这样做有无必要，我觉得是必要的。据不完全的统计，我国的戏曲剧种就有三百多。由于南北东西语言的差别，每一个剧种的唱词听起来也大不相同。不熟习某一地方方言的人，对那个地方的戏确实也不容易听懂，这势必很难领会剧情，从中受益了。
    至于交响乐，不少人对它还很生疏，更需要多作些讲解。因此，不论是对外来的交响乐，或是对多彩的地方戏曲，进行讲解和采用字幕都不是一件小事情。作为一个观众，我感谢从事这一个有益的工作的劳动者们！
