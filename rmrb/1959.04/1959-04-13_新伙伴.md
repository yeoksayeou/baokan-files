    The bus from Wuhan to Hong'an sped along the bumpy road, shaking and swaying. The road stretched along the hills towards the increasingly high mountains. The spring breeze, like two light hands, pulled back a layer of thin mist covering the land between the mountains, revealing the azure sky. People began to open the car windows, and the moist, fresh air, still carrying a hint of cold, made those accustomed to the city feel refreshed and invigorated. In the back row of the bus sat several young women, who simply stretched their hands out of the window to let the spring breeze caress them, turning their faces towards the window, the spring breeze blowing their hair into a disheveled mess on their faces, and they would often gather their hair back up, removing the obstruction to their view. Outside the window was already a world of spring, the earth a lush green, willows drooping, peach blossoms dotting the landscape, and the members of the People's Commune were shouting at the oxen as they plowed the watery fields.

    Suddenly, the bus stopped, but not at a station. Looking into the bus, it turned out that an old lady was getting off temporarily for some business. This old lady had already white hair, but she looked quite spirited, with bright eyes, and was dressed in dark blue cloth clothes. When asked, she said she was already ninety-two years old. Her seat was in the back of the bus, close to those girls. The carriage was crowded with people and luggage, making it difficult to move. It was obviously difficult for the old lady to get out from the back. To let the old lady out, many people automatically made way, busily moving luggage. Only one girl did not move anything, but instead first went to help the old lady up. This seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl had a round face, big eyes, and cheeks as red as a ripe apple. She was wearing a well-fitting light blue, buttoned-up short cotton jacket and wide-legged blue cloth trousers, like a rural student. She was full of energy, but gently helped the old lady off the bus.

    "What is someone so old doing out here? Just suffering." Obviously, some people were a little impatient with the delay caused by the stop.

    "That girl is probably her granddaughter. She only dares to come out because she has such a good granddaughter."

    After a while, the girl helped the old lady back onto the bus.

    "Girl, where are you and the old lady going?" someone asked. The girl glanced at the person who asked, smiled, and said, "I'm going to Songbu. I don't even know where the old lady is going!"

    "You are a really good girl," an old man in his sixties sitting next to the girl said with admiration, "As soon as you got on the bus, you gave your good seat to the old lady. I guessed you must be some kind of relative!"

    "It's nothing. It's what should be done," the girl said.

    "Yes, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, I know this isn't a big deal," the old man said meaningfully, puffing on his dry pipe.

    The bus continued to race forward. The scenery of water and mountains on both sides of the road slid past before people's eyes, scene after scene. The sun had already risen quite high, and the sunlight shone directly into the bus from the window, making the inside warm and cozy.

    The bus stopped next to a small bridge. This was where the ninety-two-year-old old lady was getting off. Her home was still several miles away from here. The enthusiastic girl was preparing to get up and help her off the bus when the old man waved his hand and said, "No need for you! I'll do it. I'm only a dozen or so miles from here. Sending her back and walking a few more steps is just right."

    The old lady smiled happily and said she wanted to thank the old man. The old man laughed and said, "Hurry up, don't delay other people's time. Everyone is in the Great Leap Forward now. One day is equal to twenty years. Delaying even a minute is a sin!"

    Amidst the laughter of everyone on the bus, the old man helped the old lady off the bus. The old lady followed closely behind the old man. The two newly acquainted old people looked just like two old friends. From a distance, you could still see a happy smile on the old lady's face.

    Yes, smile more. You have lived for more than ninety years and have encountered many different things, but perhaps this is the first time something like this has happened. You are already ninety-two years old. In our happy society where everyone loves each other, you will surely live a long life. Who dares to say that you cannot live to be a hundred and several decades old, see communism, and become a witness to different eras!

    从武汉到红安的公共汽车，摇摇晃晃在颠簸不平的公路上疾驶着。公路一直沿着丘岭向越来越高的深山伸展开去。春风像两只轻巧的手，拉开了盖在山间大地上的一层薄雾，蔚蓝色的天空露出来了。人们开始打开车窗，湿润、清新但还带点寒意的空气，使长在城里呆惯了的人感到一阵心爽神怡。车的后面一排坐着几个姑娘，她们干脆把手伸向窗外，让春风抚摩它，把脸朝着窗外，春风把头发吹得散乱，毫无秩序地堆在脸上，她们不时地把头发拢上去，扫去视线的障碍。窗外已是一片春天的世界了，大地一片葱绿，杨柳倒垂，桃花点点，人民公社的社员们正在水汪汪的田里吆牛起坂。
    突然，汽车停下来了，但不是车站。向车内一看，才知道是一个老太太临时下车有事。这位老太太已白发苍苍，看起来精神还挺好的，眼睛炯炯有神，浑身上下穿着一色的深蓝布衣，一问，已经九十二岁了。她的座位在车子后面，紧靠近那几个姑娘。车厢内被人和行李挤得满满的，寸步难行，这位老太太要想从后面走出来，显然是困难的。为了让老太太走出去，许多人自动起来让路了，并且忙着搬开行李。唯有一个姑娘没有去搬东西，而是首先去把老太太扶起来。这个十七八岁的姑娘，圆圆的脸儿，大眼睛，脸像一只熟透了的苹果那样红，她穿着一件合身的浅蓝大襟短棉袄，青布宽腿裤子，像一个农村学生装束，她浑身是劲儿，但却轻手轻脚地扶着老太太下车。
    “这大年纪的人出来干什么呢？找罪受。”显然，有人对中途停车耽误路程有点不耐烦了。
    “那个女孩儿大概是她孙女儿，有那么个好孙女儿她才敢出来。”
    住了一会，姑娘又扶着老太太走上车来。
    “姑娘，你和老太太到哪里去呀！”有人问道。这位姑娘向问的人看了一眼，微笑了一下说：“我是去宋埠的，我还不知道老太太到哪里去呢？”
    “你真是一位好姑娘，”坐在姑娘旁边的一位六十多岁的老伯伯感叹地说：“一上车你把你的好位子就让给老太太坐，我估摸你一定是她的什么亲人哩！”
    “这算什么？是应该的。”姑娘说。
    “是的，在毛主席的领导下，我知道这算不了一回什么事的。”老人意味深长地说着，吸起旱烟来。
    车子继续向前奔驰着。公路两旁的水光山色在人们眼前一幕一幕滑过去。太阳已经升起多高了，阳光从车窗直射进车内，把个车内晒得暖烘烘的。
    汽车在一个小桥旁边停下了，这是那位九十二岁老太太下车的地方，她的家离这里还有几里路，那位热心的姑娘正准备起身帮她下车，那个老伯伯向他摆了一摆手说：“不用你啦！我来，我离这儿不过十几里，把她送回去再走几步路正好。”
    老太太高兴得笑了，说要谢谢老伯伯，老伯伯笑着说：“快点吧，别耽误别人的时间了，现在都在大跃进，一天等于二十年，耽误一分钟也是罪过呀！”
    就在一车人的笑声中，老头扶着老太太下了车，老太太紧紧跟着老头走着，刚刚相识的两个老人，活像两个老朋友，远远还可以看到老太太脸上露出的一股幸福的微笑。
    是的，您多笑笑吧。您活了九十多年了，遇到很多各种各样的事情，但像今天这种事情，也许还是第一次。您今年已是九十二岁了，在我们这个人人相爱的幸福的社会里，您一定还要长寿，有谁敢说您不能活到一百几十岁见到共产主义、成为不同时代的见证人呢！
