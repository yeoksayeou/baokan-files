Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 7th April: The joint declaration of the conference of the communist parties of the six Western European "Common Market" countries (France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) was published here today. The declaration called for an understanding to be reached between those who demand the cessation of the implementation of the "Coal and Steel Community" treaty and the "Common Market" treaty.

The conference was held in Brussels on April 1st and 2nd, where the consequences of the "Coal and Steel Community" group and the initial impact of the "Common Market" were studied.

The joint declaration stated that the "Coal and Steel Community" group and the "Common Market" are entirely tools for monopoly capitalists to implement their policies. Due to the establishment of the "Coal and Steel Community" group and the "Common Market," monopoly capitalists can accelerate the concentration of major economic sectors and transform the economic, social, and political structures of each country to their advantage. In this way, monopoly capitalists have new tools to lower the living standards of the working class and people of the six countries, to oppose progress and the freedom of workers and democratic forces, and better weapons to prevent the liberation movements of the people of colonial countries, strengthen their plunder in Africa, oppose the easing of international tensions, restore the aggressive power of German militarism, and oppose the practical possibility of coexistence and peaceful cooperation between the people of all countries.

The joint declaration pointed out that the "Coal and Steel Community" and the "Common Market" transfer the consequences of the economic crisis appearing in most capitalist countries to the non-monopoly capital group strata. This policy of monopoly capitalists is particularly manifested in a general offensive against living conditions, wages, social welfare, and rights, which has already led to the dismissal of workers and the closure of mines and factories. Artisans and small and medium-sized business owners in the six countries are increasingly aware that their economic independence is being threatened.

The declaration went on to say that the policies of the monopoly capitalists in the six "Common Market" countries also damage democratic freedoms, trade union freedoms, and workers' rights, abolish or undermine parliamentary power and the entire democratic system, destroy the foundations of national independence that have already been damaged by U.S. imperialism, and favor the rule of monopoly capitalists and German militarism.

The joint declaration then stated that the united action of the working class is being realized, developed, and expanded. The urban and rural middle classes are also recognizing the need to stop monopoly capitalism. This creates favorable conditions for the trade unions and political organizations of the working class in the six countries to take joint action and to form alliances with other democratic forces.

The communist parties of the six countries issued a solemn appeal to the socialist parties, all trade unions, and political organizations of the six countries, urging them not to disappoint the demands of the working class, laboring peasants, and other social strata who are deeply harmed by the policies of monopoly capitalists, and to reach an understanding in the struggle against the policies of big capitalists.

The joint declaration said that the united action of the masses of the people and their organizations will help the unity of political forces that can repel monopoly capitalists and open the way to the restoration of democracy and profound social reforms. This new policy will ensure a more balanced development of economic activities in each country, thereby ensuring full employment and good living conditions for all workers. The implementation of such a policy requires substantial cuts in military spending, the elimination of all discrimination in international relations, and the promotion of trade and economic relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The joint declaration concluded by saying that among broad social strata and political figures there is an opinion that the policies currently being implemented cannot continue, and that it is already necessary to change and stop the implementation of the "Coal and Steel Community" treaty and the "Common Market" treaty. In view of this, the communist parties of the six countries believe that conferences can be organized on this basis, and that an understanding can be reached among those who, to varying degrees, express opposition to the current situation.

    西欧六国共产党代表会议发表共同宣言
    揭露“煤钢联营”“共同市场”灾难性后果
    号召人民一致行动反对垄断资本的政策
    据新华社巴黎7日电　今天在这里发表了西欧“共同市场”六国（法国、西德、意大利、荷兰、比利时和卢森堡）共产党代表会议的共同宣言。宣言号召要求停止实施“煤钢联营”集团条约和“共同市场”条约的人达成谅解。
    代表会议是在4月1日和2日在布鲁塞尔举行的，会上研究了“煤钢联营”集团的后果和“共同市场”的初步影响。
    共同宣言说，“煤钢联营”集团和“共同市场”完全是垄断资本家执行他们的政策的工具，由于建立了“煤钢联营”集团和“共同市场”，垄断资本家就可以使经济主要部门加速集中，使每个国家的经济、社会和政治结构发生有利于他们的转变。这样，垄断资本家就有了新的工具来降低六国工人阶级和人民生活水平，来反对进步以及反对工人和民主力量的自由，并且有了更好的武器来阻止殖民地各国人民的解放运动，加强它们在非洲的掠夺事业，反对缓和国际紧张局势，使德国军国主义恢复它的侵略力量，并且反对各国人民之间共处和和平合作的实际可能性。
    共同宣言提出，“煤钢联营”和“共同市场”把大部分资本主义国家中出现的经济危机的后果转嫁到非垄断资本集团阶层的身上。垄断资本家这种政策，特别表现为对生活条件、工资、社会福利和权利的普遍进攻，这种政策已经引起解雇工人、关闭矿场和工厂。六国的手工业者和中小企业主越来越明显地看到，他们的经济独立正在受到威胁。
    宣言接着说，“共同市场”六国垄断资本家的政策还损害了民主自由、工会自由和工人权利，取消或动摇了议会权力和整个民主制度，破坏了已经受到美帝国主义损害的民族独立的基础，并且有利于垄断资本家和德国军国主义的统治。
    共同宣言接着说，工人阶级的联合行动正在实现、发展和扩大。城市和乡村的中产阶级也正在认识阻止垄断资本主义的必要性。这就为六国工人阶级的工会和政治组织采取联合行动以及为它们同其他民主力量结成联盟，创造了良好的条件。
    六国共产党向六国社会党、所有工会和政治组织发出庄严的号召，要求它们不要辜负工人阶级、劳动农民和深受垄断资本家的政策之害的其他社会阶层的要求，而在反对大资本家的政策的斗争中取得谅解。
    共同宣言说，人民群众和他们的组织的一致行动，将有助于能够击退垄断资本家、开辟通向恢复民主制和深刻的社会改革的道路的政治力量的团结。这种新的政策将能保证每个国家的经济活动得到更平衡的发展，从而保证所有的劳动者能充分就业和有美好的生活条件。执行这样的政策就要大量削减军费，取消国际关系中的一切歧视，并且在平等互利的基础上促进贸易和经济关系。共同宣言最后说，在广泛的社会阶层和政界人士中出现了这样一种意见，这种意见认为现在执行的政策不能再继续下去了，已经需要改变和停止实施“煤钢联营”条约和“共同市场”条约。有鉴于此，六国共产党认为，可以在这样的基础上组织会议，并且在那些在不同程度上表示反对目前状况的人中间实现谅解。
