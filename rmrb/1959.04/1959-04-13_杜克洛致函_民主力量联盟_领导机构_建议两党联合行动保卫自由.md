Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 12th: "L'Humanité" yesterday published a letter from Maurice Thorez, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, to the Executive Committee of the "Democratic Forces Union" on the issue of organizing joint action by left-wing parties.

This is Duclos' second letter to the leadership of the "Democratic Forces Union" on this issue. In replying to his first letter, the leadership of the "Democratic Forces Union" pointed out the possibility of cooperation between the two parties "on certain issues."

In the letter published yesterday, Duclos pointed out that now, because the dictatorship has endangered France, it is necessary to form an alliance to take joint action to defend freedom and to restore and renew democracy.

Duclos wrote: "Taking into account that you have already considered it possible to reach agreement on certain issues, and firmly believing that we can jointly determine the tasks of the common struggle according to the demands of the times, we suggest that you organize a delegation from the "Democratic Forces Union" to meet with a delegation from our party as soon as possible in order to achieve the above goals."

　　杜克洛致函“民主力量联盟”领导机构
　　建议两党联合行动保卫自由
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：“人道报”昨天发表了法国共产党中央书记杜克洛就组织左翼党派联合行动问题写给“民主力量联盟”执行委员会的一封信。
    这是杜克洛就这个问题给“民主力量联盟”领导机构的第二封信。“民主力量联盟”的领导机构在答复他的第一封信的时候，曾经指出了两个党之间“就某些问题”实行合作的可能性。
    杜克洛在昨天发表的那封信中指出，现在，由于独裁政权使法国遭到了危险，有必要结成联盟以便采取共同行动来保卫自由，并且恢复和革新民主。
    杜克洛写道：“我们考虑到你们已经认为有可能就某些问题达成协议，并且深信可以根据时代的要求一起来确定共同斗争的任务，所以建议你们尽可能快地组织“民主力量联盟”代表团同我们党的代表团会晤，以达到上述目标。”
