Fellow Delegates:

I listened to the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and others, and I am very excited. I fully support them and will resolutely implement them in my practical work.

I am from Huitong County in the Hunan forest area and have been engaged in forestry work for nearly forty years. However, having suffered from the exploitation and oppression of feudal landlords, I used to toil year after year, opening mountains, digging soil, planting trees, and felling timber, yet I could not get enough to eat or wear and lived a life worse than that of cattle and horses. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I turned over and truly became the master of the mountains and forests. Over the past ten years since the founding of the country, production has developed by leaps and bounds, and political, economic, and cultural life has greatly improved. For someone like me, whose ancestors for three generations never entered a school and who started working as a cowherd for a landlord at the age of twelve, to be able to express my opinions at the solemn National People's Congress today is a great joy!

During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our forest area, like other parts of the country, achieved tremendous results. Our county felled 600,000 cubic meters of timber last year, and our Guangping People's Commune accounted for 130,000 cubic meters, which played a very important role in supporting socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward of 1958.

Based on an estimated annual felling of 130,000 cubic meters, our commune will cut down all the existing forests in just over ten years. Therefore, while vigorously felling timber to support national construction, we must vigorously plant and cultivate forests, so that we can plant trees for a hundred years and plant trees every year. Planting and cultivating forests is a matter of seeking happiness for future generations. We cannot only consider the current need for timber, “shave bald heads” everywhere, and not pay attention to planting and cultivating forests. There is an old saying, "The predecessors plant trees, and the descendants eat the fruit." If we only cut and do not plant, what timber will our descendants have to use and what fruit will they have to eat? Of course, the economic benefits of planting trees will only be seen after many years, so-called "ten years to grow trees," which means that it takes ten years for tree planting to become timber. However, as long as we properly combine grain and forestry, the long-term benefits of planting trees and the current benefits of growing grain can be combined. According to our experience: intercropping grain and forestry on one mu of mountain forest can yield more than 200 jin of grain each year. On the other hand, because of the annual loosening of soil and the shading of young seedlings by crops, and the use of crop stalks as fertilizer, the time for trees to mature is greatly shortened. What a great thing this is! Only in this way can we continuously supply the ever-increasing needs of our country's socialist construction.

Before liberation, during the rule of the reactionary government, the forests in our county suffered extremely serious damage, and barren mountains accounted for more than one-third of the entire forest area. Since liberation, under the attention and leadership of the Party and the government, we have vigorously planted and cultivated forests, strictly prevented fire, and protected the forests. Now we have basically eliminated barren mountains, and the whole county has been greened. Last winter and this spring, one of our brigades reforested the 1,700 mu area felled last year, achieving felling on one side and afforestation and cultivation on the other. In this way, we can ensure that forest resources are inexhaustible and inexhaustible. The forests we planted in 1953 were already more than a foot in circumference and more than two zhang high last year, with dense branches and leaves. The results are very remarkable. Many provinces have sent representatives to our county and commune to visit, which is a great encouragement to us. Now I will report a little of our experience in afforestation to the conference, and please give your comments.

(1) Select good seeds and cultivate strong seedlings. The quality of plant seeds and seedlings has a great relationship with growth and survival. Good seeds and good seedlings, and good seedlings and good trees, this is a very important experience. In the past, we always bought seedlings from outside. Due to inconvenient transportation and long excavation time, the survival rate was only about 50%. Since we changed to selecting and cultivating seedlings ourselves, we can select strong seedlings, excavate and plant seedlings at the same time, and not let the seedlings be exposed to wind and sun, and not plant seedlings overnight. With the cooperation of other conditions, the survival rate has reached more than 98%. When collecting seeds, pay attention to collecting strong seeds. Old branches, single trees, budding trees, and burnt trees should not be collected. This is called "four not to collect." The seeds should be stored and kept well after collection to prevent moisture, mildew, or smoke. When seeds have been stored for a long time, they should be stirred every month to prevent them from spoiling. These are all factors that increase the survival rate. Self-afforestation and self-cultivation of seedlings can not only improve the survival rate and reduce costs, but also cultivate seedlings on demand, process fertilizer, and manage and cultivate strong seedlings.

(2) There are many benefits to afforestation in winter. In the past, it was customary to plant trees in the spring, and many people did not believe that afforestation in winter could be successful. In fact, this is also a kind of superstition. After the successful experiment in 1954, this superstition has been broken, and winter afforestation has been promoted. Winter afforestation has these advantages: farmers are idle in winter, and forest farmers have more time to afforest; although the ground climate is colder, the underground is warmer. Winter afforestation can grow roots first and survive better. Spring afforestation will germinate first because the ground is warmer, and then grow roots, so the survival rate is not as high as in winter. Originally, afforestation can be done in all seasons, but we believe that winter is the best under the climatic conditions in our area.

(3) Deep plowing, deep digging, and layered fertilization. Dig deep two or three feet or more, so that the upper and lower soil layers are not disturbed. Apply coarse fertilizer to the lower layer and fine fertilizer to the middle and upper layers. Apply more than 2,000 dan of fertilizer per mu (including rotten weeds, turf, humus black soil, fire ash, human and animal manure, etc.). If conditions permit, you can also use growth stimulants, intercrop beans and green manure, and turn them into the forest to increase fertilizer efficiency to promote the growth of trees and accelerate maturity.

(4) Promote appropriate dense planting and triangular tree planting method. About 600 fir trees can be planted per mu, maintaining a plant spacing of about three feet. Appropriate dense planting can make the wood grow tall, and the thickness of the roots and tails is more uniform, which is convenient for use. Triangular tree planting allows ventilation on all sides and sunshine on all sides, maintains soil and water, and prevents water and soil from rushing down. When planting trees, start from the mountain peak, which is easy to be neat and beautiful, and lines are straight and rows are aligned. In short, it can be summarized as "deep planting, dense planting, and no reverse slope." Deep planting can prevent frost and sun, and absorb more underground water. No reverse slope can make the wood grow in a straight line. When planting small trees, hold the seedlings with your left hand and rake the soil with your right hand. When planting larger trees, the cooperation of two or more people is required.

(5) Organize fire prevention and forest protection teams, and assign responsibility to each person. Since liberation, no serious forest fires have occurred in our county. The main reason is to organize fire prevention and forest protection teams, vigorously publicize the great significance of forest fire prevention, formulate forest fire prevention covenants, and often have people lookout and stand guard. If a fire occurs, the masses will be quickly organized to put it out. The covenant of six no-burns in the forest was formulated (no burning without the approval of the higher authorities, no burning without organized personnel to guard, no burning without digging firebreaks, no burning when the sun is strong and windy, no burning without preparing fire-fighting tools, and no burning from bottom to top).

(6) In order to standardize and gardenize large-scale afforestation, we have adopted the method of key demonstration site visits to promote it in an all-round way. In recent years, no less than 10,000 people from various provinces and counties in our province have visited our commune, and people from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam have visited us. Minister Liang Xi has also been there, and they all praised our achievements. We have also visited many advanced afforestation units across the country and in our province to learn from them. Such mutual visits, on-site learning, and exchange of experience, from point to surface, from less to more, breaking through one point and promoting it in an all-round way, have made the afforestation and cultivation movement last winter and this spring develop quickly and vigorously. In addition, we also train technical personnel at all levels, so that everyone understands the technology.

(7) Give prominence to politics, strengthen leadership, and rationally arrange labor. From the county and commune to the production team, leading comrades personally take the lead in grasping timber production. Felling timber on one hand and planting trees on the other is also "walking on two legs." A greening guidance committee was established, with large groups of people preparing the land and professional teams planting trees. Land preparation requires a large amount of labor and is less technical, so men, women, old and young can all be mobilized; afforestation requires less labor but is more technical, so old farmers, key members, and experienced people are selected to form professional teams. In this way, with leadership, organization, and division of labor, we can both accelerate the progress of afforestation and ensure the quality of afforestation.

This is a successful measure for greening large areas of barren mountains.

Of course, the series of work we have carried out has not been smooth sailing and has not encountered any difficulties. For example, in recent years, many places have indiscriminately felled timber without planning, and the forests have been severely damaged. Some people do not believe that the survival rate of winter afforestation is high, and there are right-leaning conservative ideas against dense planting, but under the correct leadership of the Party, these difficulties can be quickly overcome.

I believe that with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the soaring enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, greening the whole country and realizing the gardenization of the whole country is not far away.

### 东风绿化万重山  张万宏代表的发言

    东风绿化万重山
    张万宏代表的发言各位代表：
    我听了周恩来总理和李富春、李先念副总理等首长的报告，十分兴奋，完全拥护，回到实际工作中后一定要坚决贯彻执行。
    我是湖南林区会同县人，从事林业劳动已经快四十年了，但是由于受尽了封建地主的剥削与压迫，过去终年开山挖土、造林伐木，辛勤劳苦，却得不到温饱，过着牛马不如的生活。解放后，在共产党和毛主席的领导下翻了身，才真正做了山林的主人。建国十年来，生产飞跃地发展，政治、经济、文化生活都得到了很大的提高。像我这样，祖宗三代未进过学堂门，十二岁起就为地主看牛当长工的穷棒子，今天能够在庄严的全国人民代表大会上发表意见，是何等的高兴！
    一九五八年的大跃进，我们林区与全国各地一样取得了巨大的成绩。我县在去年砍伐了六十万立方公尺的木材，我们广坪人民公社占了十三万立方公尺，这对支持社会主义建设和一九五八年的大跃进起了极重大的作用。
    以年采十三万立方公尺的水平估算，我们公社只要十多年就要把现有森林砍光。因而在大力采林支援国家建设的同时，必须大力造林育林，做到百年树木，年年造林。造林育林是一件为子孙万代谋幸福的事情。不能只顾目前需要木材，到处“剃光头”，而不注意造林育林。有句老话，“前人栽树，后人吃果”，我们如果只砍不栽，我们的后人还有什么木材可用、果子可吃呢？当然，造林的经济利益，要经过很多年才能看到，所谓“十年树木”，就是说造林要经过十年才能成材。但是，只要我们适当地进行粮林结合，那么造林的长远利益和种粮食的目前利益就结合起来了。根据我们的经验：一亩山林粮林间作，每年既可以收到二百多斤粮食，而另一方面由于每年挖松、农作物还可为幼苗遮荫，农作物叶秆还可作肥料，树木成材的时间就大大地缩短了。这是多么好的事情呢！？这样才能源源不绝地供应我们国家社会主义建设不断增长的需要。
    我县在解放前反动政权统治时期，森林遭受了极其严重的破坏，荒山占了整个山林面积的三分之一以上。解放以来，在党和政府的重视和领导下，大力造林育林，严密防火护林，现在已基本消灭了荒山，全县实现绿化。我们一个大队，去冬今春又把去年砍伐一千七百亩地区造了林，做到了一边砍伐，一边造林育林，这样，我们就可以保证森林资源取之不尽、伐之不竭。我们在一九五三年造的林，到去年已有一尺多围，二丈多高，枝叶茂密，成绩很显著，好多省分都派代表到我们县和公社参观，对我们鼓舞更大。现在我把我们造林的一点体会向大会作个汇报，请大家指正。
    （1）选良种、育壮苗。植物的种苗优良对生长成活有很大关系，种好苗好，苗好树好，这是很重要的一条经验。过去我们造林总是向外收买种苗，由于运输不便出土时间长，成活率只有百分之五十左右。自从改为自己选种育苗后，可以选用壮苗、随起苗、随造林、不让苗木风吹日晒、不栽隔夜苗，加上其它条件的配合，成活率就达到了百分之九十八以上。在采种子时，要注意采壮实种子。老枝木、独林木、萌芽木、火烧木都是不宜采种的，这就叫“四不采”。种子采回要收藏保管好，防止潮湿、发霉或熏烟，种子收管较久时，每月要拌动，才不会变坏。这都是提高成活率的因素。自造林自育苗，不仅可以提高成活率，降低成本，而且可以按需育苗，加工施肥、管理，培育壮苗。
    （2）冬季造林好处多。过去习惯都是春季造林，很多人不相信冬季造林能成功。其实这也是一种迷信，经过一九五四年实验成功后，已经冲破了这个迷信，冬季造林得以推广。冬季造林有这些好处：冬季农闲，林农有更多的时间来造林；地面气候虽较冷，地下却较暖，冬季造林就能先生根，成活较好，春季造林，因地面较暖，所以先发芽、后生根，成活率就不及冬季高。本来四季都可以造林，但我们认为在我们地区的气候条件下要以冬季最好。
    （3）深耕深挖，分层施肥。深挖二、三尺以上，做到上下土层不乱，粗肥施下层，细肥施中、上层，每亩施肥在二千担以上
  （包括腐蚀杂草、草皮、腐质黑土、火土灰、人畜粪等），有条件还可以用生长刺激素，间作豆类、绿肥，翻入林地增长肥效，以促进林木生长，加速成材。
    （4）推广适当密植，三角形栽树法。杉木一亩可种六百株左右，保持株行距三尺左右，适当密植可使木料长得高，蔸尾粗细较匀，便利使用。三角形栽树，可以四面通风，四面朝阳，保持水土，挡住水、土往下冲。栽树方法，要从山峰而下，才易整齐美观，横直成线，左右成行。总之，可以用“深栽密植不反山”来概括，深栽可以防冻防晒，更多的吸收地下水分，不反山可以使木材长得直线。栽小树要左手握苗，右手耙土，栽大点的树时要有二人以上的协作。
    （5）组织防火护林队，分工包干负责。解放后，我县从未发生严重森林火灾，主要是组织防火护林队，大力宣传了森林防火的重大意义，订立了森林防火公约，经常有人了望、放哨，发生火警，即迅速组织群众扑灭。订出了森林六不烧的公约（未经上级批准不烧，没有组织人员看守不烧、没有挖防火线不烧、太阳大风大不烧、没有准备打火工具不烧、不从下向上烧）。
    （6）为使大面积造林规格化园林化，我们采取了重点示范现场参观办法全面推广。几年来从各省和本省各县来我们公社参观的不下万人，越南人民共和国来过人。梁希部长也去过，都称赞我们的成绩。我们也到全国和本省许多造林先进单位参观学习过。这样互相参观，现场学习，交流经验，由点到面，由少到多，突破一点，推广全面，使去冬今春的造林育林运动很快地就蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。此外，还层层训练技术人员，做到一人懂技术，人人懂技术。
    （7）政治挂帅、加强领导，合理安排劳动力。从县、公社到生产队领导同志亲自动手抓林木生产。一手伐木，一手造林，也是“两条腿走路”。成立绿化指导委员会，大兵团整地，专业队造林，整地需劳动量大，技术性较低，男女老少可以一齐出动；造林需工少，而技术性较高，就挑选老农、骨干分子、有经验的人组织专业队。这样有领导、有组织、有分工，既加速造林进度，又保证了造林质量。
    这是绿化大面积荒山的一个成功的措施。
    当然，我们进行的一系列工作，并不是一帆风顺，没有碰到一点困难的。例如最近几年，许多地方无计划地滥伐木材，森林受到严重破坏。还有人不相信冬季造林成活率高，并有反对密植的右倾保守思想，但是在党的正确领导下，这些困难都是能够迅速克服的。
    我相信有了党和毛主席的领导，有了全国人民的冲天干劲，绿化全国，实现全国的园林化，并不是遥远无期了。
