Xinhua News Agency: The workers of the Ke Yihe Forestry Bureau in the Great Khingan Mountains, who were the first to complete their quarterly plan ahead of schedule in the first quarter timber battle, once again took the lead in April, exceeding their plan by eight days.

After winning the first battle in the first quarter, the workers of this forestry bureau immediately summarized their experiences. In early April, the bureau held a red flag competition and commendation conference, selecting twenty-three red flag units and sixty-eight advanced producers. Red flags were widely planted and pace-setters were established in various industries and trades, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the workers.

The main reason why the Ke Yihe Forestry Bureau was able to complete its production plan ahead of schedule in April was that it focused on the "timber transportation" link. This year, the forest farms under the forestry bureau have strengthened the maintenance of road pontoon bridges, so that the proportion of simple road transportation of timber is still maintained above 80%, greatly shortening the distance of timber collection and improving the efficiency of timber transportation. This enabled the average daily timber transported to the forest farm in April to maintain a level of eight hundred to nine hundred cubic meters. Now, the workers in various forest areas are determined to work harder and more cleverly, and produce another eight to nine thousand cubic meters of timber by the end of the month as a gift to the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

    大兴安岭克一河林业局
    木材生产月月红
    新华社讯　大兴安岭在第一季度木材争夺战中首先提前完成季度计划的克一河林业局的职工，4月份又一马当先提前八天超额完成了计划。
    这个林业局的职工第一季度首战告捷以后，立即总结了经验，4月上旬，全局举行了红旗竞赛评比大会，评选出二十三个红旗单位和六十八名先进生产者，在各行业各个工种上普遍插上红旗，树立标兵，大大激发了职工的干劲。
    克一河林业局4月份能提前完成生产计划的主要原因，是抓紧了
  “运材”这一环节。林业局所属各林场今年加强了道路便桥的维护，使简易公路运材比重仍保持在80％以上，大大缩短了集材距离，提高了运材效率。使4月份每天平均运到林场的木材一直保持在八百到九百立方公尺的水平。现在各林区的职工，决心劲上加劲，巧上加巧，到月底再生产八千到九千立方公尺木材，作为向“五一”国际劳动节的献礼。（附图片）
