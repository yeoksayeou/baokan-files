The six-competition red flag campaign, centered on technological revolution, at the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive Works has unleashed a Great Leap Forward, with new records emerging daily and production constantly surging forward. According to preliminary calculations, the labor productivity of the factory's main workshops in March increased by more than 30% compared to February. More than 90% of the workers participating in individual competitions have been completing or overfulfilling their daily plans, with some individuals and groups doubling, tripling, or even quadrupling or quintupling their daily production.

In carrying out the six-competition (competing in enthusiasm, output, quality, cost, labor productivity, and safety) red flag campaign, the factory implemented the working method of putting politics in command and giving ideological guidance, and conducted comprehensive ideological mobilization and education. At the outset, a bottom-up assessment of ideology, equipment, and key problems was conducted, followed by a factory-wide airing of views and debates. The workers raised their awareness, boosted their enthusiasm, and formulated competition conditions, with everyone finding opponents and setting goals, thereby launching a comprehensive competition movement between workshops, groups, machine tools, and individuals. From the very beginning of the competition, the factory leadership firmly grasped the central link of technological revolution, urging workers to combine hard work with ingenuity, vigorously propose rationalization suggestions, promote advanced experiences, and carry out technical research. Workshops also launched activities such as tackling key problems and offering suggestions, resulting in the factory generating 2,849 rationalization proposals from March 1st to 26th. The implementation of these suggestions greatly increased labor productivity. For example, the riveting workshop implemented 316 rationalization proposals in fourteen days, increasing labor productivity in the first half of March by 1.6 times compared to December of last year. Lathe operator Ma Shiyong created a non-stop clamping device, increasing labor productivity by nine times. The electroplating room group improved and created more than 40 kinds of molds and tools, increasing production in the first half of March by an average of two times per day compared to January and February, and completing 70% of the total production of January and February in just half a month. In the competition, the factory further promoted more than 50 advanced experiences. The forging workshop put forward the slogan of "ten major experience exchanges, one hundred experience introductions," promoting ten major forging experiences such as multi-part forging in a single mold and bilateral operations, increasing the efficiency of more than 400 kinds of parts by more than one time.

In the competition, the factory also proposed various different competition forms according to the central requirements of the six competitions, so that every worker had specific directions and goals. For example, after launching the "double the output" competition in assembly and auxiliary workshops, each worker was required to strive to double the amount of work completed each day compared to the labor quota. Among mechanical processing workers, the "thousand machine-hours" movement was launched, requiring each machine tool to complete one thousand machine-hours of work per month. Among apprentices, competitions such as six-competition, six-good were launched. Due to the adoption of different forms and requirements, not only were all employees mobilized, but the competition progressed rapidly. In the "thousand machine-hours" movement in the mechanical workshop, machine tools and individuals competed with each other, and production has increased by 32.6% compared to February. In the "double the output" competition in the passenger car workshop, the number of people completing and exceeding the daily plan increased every day. At the beginning of the month, only 40% of the workers completed the plan each day, but now 95% of the workers have completed and exceeded the plan. More than 90% of the workers in the factory have been completing and exceeding the plan on a daily basis.

    六比竞赛卷起跃进巨浪
    四方机车厂主要车间的劳动生产率一个月提高30％
    本报讯　青岛四方机车厂在全面开展以技术革命为中心的六比红旗竞赛以来，新纪录天天涌现，生产不断跃进。据初步计算，全厂主要车间3月份的劳动生产率比2月份提高30％以上。参加个人竞赛的工人，有90％以上做到按日完成或超额完成计划，有的个人和小组每天生产翻一番、二番以至四、五番以上。
    这个厂在开展六比（比干劲、比产量、比质量、比成本、比劳动生产率、比安全）红旗竞赛中，贯彻执行了政治挂帅、思想领先的工作方法，进行了全面的思想发动和教育工作。一开始，就进行了自下而上的思想、设备、关键问题的摸底排队，接着又在全厂展开鸣放辩论。职工们提高了认识，鼓足了干劲，纷纷制订竞赛条件，人人找对手，个个找目标，从而展开了车间与车间、小组与小组、机床与机床、个人与个人的全面竞赛运动。竞赛一开始，厂领导上就紧紧抓住技术革命这一中心环节，向职工提出要把苦干和巧干结合起来，要大力提合理化建议，推广先进经验，开展技术研究。各车间也开展了攻关键、献计策等活动，全厂在3月1日至26日就提出合理化建议二千八百四十九件。这些建议的实现，大大提高了劳动生产率。如压铆车间在十四天中实现了三百一十六件合理化建议，使3月上半月的劳动生产率比去年12月份提高了一点六倍。车工马世勇创造了不停车夹具，劳动生产率提高了九倍。电镀室小组改进创造了四十多种胎模、工具，使3月上半月的生产比1、2月份平均每天翻两番，半个月完成了1、2两月份总产量的70％。在竞赛中全厂进一步推广了五十余种先进经验，锻工车间提出“十大经验交流、百项经验介绍”的口号，推广了一模多锻、双边作业等十大锻造经验，使四百多种配件效率提高一倍以上。
    这个厂在竞赛中，还根据六比的中心要求，提出了各种不同的竞赛形式，使每一个职工都有具体的方向和奋斗目标。如在组装、辅助车间开展了“翻一番”的竞赛以后，要求每个工人每天完成的工作量争取比工时定额翻一番；在机械加工工人中开展“千台时”运动，要求每台机床一个月完成一千个工时的工作量；在徒工中开展了六比、六好等竞赛。由于采取了不同的形式和要求，不仅把全体职工发动起来了，而且使竞赛进展迅速。机械车间在“千台时”运动中，机床与机床、个人与个人互相竞赛，到目前生产比2月份提高了32.6％。客车车间在“翻一番”竞赛中，完成和超额完成日计划的人数天天增加，月初每天只有40％的工人完成计划，目前已有95％的工人完成和超额完成计划。全厂有90％以上的工人做到了按日完成和超额完成计划。
