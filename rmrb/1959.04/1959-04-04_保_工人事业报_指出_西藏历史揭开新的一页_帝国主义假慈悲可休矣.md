Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, April 2nd: The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Cause" published an article on April 1st by Borkov, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and editor-in-chief of the newspaper, commenting on the Tibetan rebellion.

In the article entitled "Professional Mourners," the author stated that the quelling of the Tibetan rebellion has opened a new page in Tibetan history—a page of more rapid socialist development. This is another victory for the powerful People's Republic of China, another victory for the forces of world peace and the entire socialist camp. The people of the socialist camp countries warmly congratulate their ally and brother—the victory of the great Chinese people.

The article says that the imperialists have launched an anti-communist and slanderous campaign against China by taking advantage of the crushing of the Tibetan rebellion. They are hypocritically crying, and the bourgeois newspapers, radio stations, and all Western propaganda machines have been constantly accusing the People's Republic of China, slandering the socialist camp and the world communist movement these days. Those who want to separate Tibet from China also call themselves "friends" of the Tibetan people and "defenders" of freedom and independence. The US State Department and the gentlemen in Washington expressed "deep sympathy" for the Tibetan people and accused China of "interference" in Tibet. The article points out that it is hard to imagine anything more cunning and hypocritical than this!

The author said, how much are the crocodile tears shed by the "professional mourners" worth! These mourners once shed tears for Imre Nagy of Hungary, for the overthrown dictator Batista of Cuba, and for Shawwaf, the leader of the Mosul rebellion who was defeated by the Iraqi people. However, neither subversive movements nor anti-communist movements, neither cunning behaviors nor hypocritical behaviors can stop the course of history.

### 保“工人事业报”指出  西藏历史揭开新的一页  帝国主义假慈悲可休矣

    保“工人事业报”指出
    西藏历史揭开新的一页
    帝国主义假慈悲可休矣
    新华社索非亚2日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”1日刊登了保加利亚共产党中央委员会候补委员、报纸主编鲍科夫的一篇评论西藏叛乱事件的文章。
    作者在这篇题为“职业哭灵人”的文章中说，西藏叛乱的平息揭开了西藏历史新的一页——社会主义更迅速发展的一页，这是强大的中华人民共和国的又一胜利，是世界和平力量和整个社会主义阵营的又一胜利，社会主义阵营国家的人民热烈祝贺自己的盟国和兄弟——伟大的中国人民的胜利。
    文章说，帝国主义者借西藏叛乱被粉碎一事发动了反共和诬蔑中国的运动，他们假慈悲地哭泣起来，资产阶级报纸和电台以及西方的所有宣传机器这几天不停地指责中华人民共和国，诬蔑社会主义阵营和世界共产主义运动。那些想使西藏脱离中国的人还自称是藏族人民的“朋友”，自由和独立的“维护者”。美国国务院和华盛顿的先生们对藏族人民表示“深切同情”，并污蔑中国对西藏进行了“干涉”。文章指出，很难想像有比这更狡猾更虚伪的了！
    作者说，“职业哭灵人”流出的假惺惺眼泪所值几何！这些哭灵人曾经为匈牙利的伊姆雷·纳吉，为古巴的垮了台的独裁者巴蒂斯塔，为被伊拉克人民击溃了的摩苏尔叛乱的首领沙瓦夫都流过眼泪。但是，不管是颠复运动和反共运动，不管是狡猾的行为和虚伪的行为都阻止不了历史的进程。
