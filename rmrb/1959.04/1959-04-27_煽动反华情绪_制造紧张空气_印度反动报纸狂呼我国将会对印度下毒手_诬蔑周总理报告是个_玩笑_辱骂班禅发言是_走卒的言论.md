Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 25th: Wanton slander and attacks against our country, even to the point of openly insulting our national leaders, have become a characteristic of the rhetoric of some reactionary newspapers in India.

"The New India Times," in a commentary published on the 23rd, posing as the successor to the British imperialists, claimed that "China is making these threats to prevent India from speaking on the Tibet issue, so that China can completely annex Tibet."

This newspaper, in order to incite the Indian people to be hostile to China, actually frantically shouted that "India is now facing a serious crisis"; "If India remains silent on the Tibet issue, then its security will be seriously threatened." It fabricated a tense atmosphere, saying, "It is clear that China will not hesitate to argue about India's 30,000 square miles of territory and the issue of Bhutan at the appropriate time," and "China will not hesitate to strike at India whenever it has the opportunity."

This newspaper also echoed the tone of "Western countries," saying that the so-called Dalai Lama's statement "proves that the democratic world's accusation that communist countries have never fulfilled any agreements is correct"; "Therefore, Western countries are afraid to conclude any agreements with communist countries."

The righteous and stern speech of Panchen Erdeni, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and representative to the National People's Congress, on the 22nd at the National People's Congress, clearly greatly angered the Indian expansionists. This newspaper actually broke out in abuse in its commentary, saying, "China controls a lackey like Panchen."

"The Free Press," published on the 24th, also brazenly published an editorial entitled "Words of a Lackey," frantically attacking and slandering the Panchen Lama's speech at the National People's Congress. It clamored that Premier Zhou Enlai "praised India on the first day," while "the puppet Panchen Lama insulted our country on the second day."

This newspaper, which rabidly attacks our country, also said, "India has consistently refrained from publicizing the Tibet issue," "because we still believe in the inherent wisdom of the Panchsheel principles."

This newspaper even threatened Premier Zhou Enlai, saying, "If he insists on using the Panchen Lama as China's disgusting mouthpiece, India may have to remove the restrictions it currently imposes on the Dalai Lama against engaging in non-religious activities."

"The Indian Nation," in its editorial on the 23rd, openly insulted our national leaders and attacked Premier Zhou Enlai's solemn report at the National People's Congress as a "Chinese joke." It said, "Even when the People's Liberation Army controlled the situation in Tibet and established the new Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, saying that the agreement had not been violated is truly a pastime for after-dinner conversation."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 25th: "The Times of India," which has been using the Tibetan rebellion to openly attack China, has now suddenly changed its tactics, attempting to accuse China in turn, blaming the political consequences caused by the conspiracy of Indian expansionists attempting to divide China's territory of Tibet on others. This newspaper exposed this clumsy tactic in its commentary today on Prime Minister Nehru's talks at a press conference in Mussoorie. It said, "Here it is believed that Prime Minister (Nehru) is actually inviting Panchen Erdeni or any prominent Chinese figure to come and discuss the issue with the Dalai Lama, in an attempt to prevent the issue from falling into a hopeless quagmire, which it probably would if Beijing's current massive accusations continue."

The commentary said, "Nehru's suggestion has actually placed the issue in the realm of practical politics, and if both sides sincerely seek a solution, they should discuss their differences together in order to find a solution. Now, the next step clearly depends on the Chinese."

Anyone who is not forgetful still remembers that this newspaper has constantly used the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" disseminated by Indian Foreign Ministry officials to desperately attack China. It said that in this "statement" "a picture of communist imperialism is presented." This newspaper also described the Chinese government's suppression of a rebellion by a small number of Tibetan reactionaries in religious robes as an attack on so-called Tibetan "religious freedom," insisting that "Beijing ignores Tibet's arguably religious self-determination," and it emphasized that "this is an issue on which there can be no compromise."

However, now, just as fair-minded public opinion in various countries is constantly exposing the ugly faces of Indian expansionists, this newspaper, in order to cover up its ugliness, is pretending to be concerned in its desperation, saying that "Prime Minister Nehru is actually inviting Panchen Lama or any prominent Chinese figure to come and discuss the issue with the Dalai Lama, in an attempt to prevent the issue from falling into a hopeless quagmire." However, this trick proposed by The Times of India, as Chinese public opinion has revealed, is merely a replica of the so-called "Simla Conference" historically directed by British imperialists with the aim of interfering in China's internal affairs. This newspaper believes that if China does not accept, it can shift the responsibility to China in order to extricate the Indian expansionists from their embarrassing position. But this approach will only make its situation more embarrassing.

    煽动反华情绪　制造紧张空气
    印度反动报纸狂呼我国将会对印度下毒手
    诬蔑周总理报告是个“玩笑”　辱骂班禅发言是“走卒的言论”
    新华社25日讯　新德里消息：肆意诽谤和攻击我国，以至公然侮辱我国国家领导人，已经成为印度一些反动报刊言论的特色。
      “新印度时报”在23日发表的一篇评论中，以英帝国主义者的继承者自居，说什么“中国正在作出这些威胁，以不让印度在西藏问题上讲话，然后中国就可以完全吞并西藏”。
    这家报纸为了煽动印度人民敌视中国，居然狂呼什么“现在印度面临着严重的危机”；“如果印度对西藏问题保持沉默的话，那么它的安全就会受到严重威胁”。它凭空制造紧张空气说：“很明显，中国将会在适当的时机为印度的三万平方英里地区以及不丹问题进行争吵”，“只要有机会，中国将毫不犹豫地对印度下毒手”。
    这家报纸还以“西方国家”应声虫的口吻说，所谓达赖喇嘛的声明“证明民主世界指责共产党国家从来没有履行过任何协议的话是正确的”；“所以西方国家害怕和共产党国家缔结任何协议”。
    全国人民代表大会代表、西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼22日在全国人民代表大会上义正词严的发言，显然使印度扩张主义者大为恼怒。这家报纸在评论中竟然破口谩骂：“中国控制了像班禅这样一个走卒。”
    24日出版的“自由新闻”也放肆地以“走卒的言论”为题，发表社论，疯狂攻击和污蔑班禅大师在全国人民代表大会上的发言。他叫嚣说，周恩来总理“在第一天赞扬了印度”，“而傀儡班禅喇嘛在第二天对我国进行了谩骂”。
    猖狂攻击我国的这家报纸还说，“印度一直是坚持不渝地不大宣扬西藏问题的”，“因为我们仍然相信潘查希拉原则固有的智慧”。
    这家报纸甚至还向周恩来总理威胁说，“假如他坚持利用班禅喇嘛作为中国的令人作呕的喉舌，印度很可能不得不取消它现在对达赖喇嘛所规定的不进行非宗教活动的限制”。
    “印度民族报”在23日的社论中，公然侮辱我国国家领导人，攻击周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会上所作的庄严的报告是一个“中国的玩笑”。它说，“甚至在人民解放军控制了西藏的局势，设立了新的西藏自治区筹备委员会的时候，还说协议没有遭到破坏，这真是茶余饭后的玩笑了”。
    新华社新德里25日电　一直利用西藏叛乱事件露骨攻击中国的“印度时报”现在突然改变手法，企图反咬中国一口，把由印度扩张主义分子妄图分割中国领土西藏的阴谋活动所造成的政治后果嫁祸于人。这家报纸在它今天就尼赫鲁总理在穆索里举行的记者招待会上的谈话所发表的评论中暴露了这一拙劣的手法。它说，“这里认为，（尼赫鲁）总理实际上是邀请班禅额尔德尼或中国的任何显要人物前来和达赖喇嘛讨论问题，企图使问题不致陷入毫无希望的泥坑中，如果北京目前大量的猛烈指责继续下去，这个问题大概就会陷入那种泥坑中。”
    评论说，“尼赫鲁的建议实际上已把问题放在实际政治的方面，如果双方切望求得解决，他们应该一起讨论他们的分歧，以便找到解决办法。现在，下一个步骤显然要看中国人了。”
    只要不是健忘的人都还记得这家报纸不断利用印度外交部官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”拼命攻击中国。它说什么在这项“声明”中“呈现了一幅共产帝国主义的图景”。这家报纸还把中国政府平定一小撮披着宗教袈裟的西藏反动分子的叛乱说成是对所谓西藏“宗教自由”的进攻，硬说是“北京无视西藏的可以说是宗教自决的权利”，它强调“这是一个不可能有所妥协的问题”。
    但是，目前正当各国公正舆论不断揭穿印度扩张主义分子的丑恶面目的时候，这家报纸为了遮丑，在急中生计，假惺惺地说什么“尼赫鲁总理实际上是邀请班禅喇嘛或中国的任何显要人物前来和达赖喇嘛讨论问题，企图使问题不致陷入毫无希望的泥坑中”。可是印度时报提出的这种诡计，正如中国舆论所揭露的，不过是历史上英帝国主义者所导演的目的在于干涉中国内政的所谓“西姆拉会议”的翻版。这家报纸以为如果中国不接受，就可以把责任推到中国头上，以解脱印度扩张主义分子所处的难堪的地位。但是这种做法只会使它的处境更加难堪。
