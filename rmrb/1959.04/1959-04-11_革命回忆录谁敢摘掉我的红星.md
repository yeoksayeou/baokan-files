Revolutionary Memoirs: Who Dares Remove My Red Star
Major General Cai Bingshen

　　In 1932, Comrade Xia Yongming was already forty years old. He was fat and strong, with eyes that were often squinted. When he smiled, the wrinkles on his face all gathered around the corners of his eyes, hiding his eyes behind them. He had thick lips and rarely spoke, but when he did, it was only a few words, neat and forceful.

　　He worked as a cook in the company. When garrisoned, after the cooking squad finished their work, he would make a pair of straw sandals for this new soldier, or mend clothes for that new soldier. When marching, he cheerfully followed behind the company carrying the food supplies, "holding up the rear." If anyone fell behind, he would come up and say:
　　"Young man, are you here to help, or to keep me company?"
　　At this point, the person who had fallen behind would be embarrassed and shout: "We'll settle the score when we get there!" and quicken their pace to catch up.

　　Before joining the army, Comrade Xia Yongming lived in the countryside of Liu'an County, western Anhui. He had a father, a wife, and two children. His father was old, and the family relied on him alone to farm the land, barely making ends meet. After the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, the Kuomintang army came and went, frequently passing through this area. Each time they passed, they stripped the land bare, and the common people were left with nothing. By 1930, when Chiang Kai-shek sent troops to encircle and suppress the Red Army, the Kuomintang's 46th Division arrived, and life became unbearable. One day, Xia Yongming's family ran out of food. He picked up a bag and went out to beg for a loan, but after running around for half a day, he returned empty-handed. He had no choice but to come home hungry. As he reached the door, he heard his wife shouting inside the house. Xia Yongming was startled, knowing something must have happened. He grabbed a stick and rushed in. Inside, a drunken officer of the 46th Division was tearing at his wife's clothes, and a soldier was sitting on his two children, pouring wine down their throats. The old father was lying on the ground, dead. Seeing this, Xia Yongming struck the officer on the back of the waist with the stick, knocking him to the ground with a scream. The soldier, seeing things were not good, dropped the bottle and ran out. Xia Yongming thought: Might as well go all the way, and beat the officer while sitting on him. Just then, the soldier returned with a dozen men. The officer, groaning from the beating, shouted: "Beat this whole family to death! I think they are all Red bandits."

　　As he spoke, the dozen or so soldiers had already raised their rifle butts and began beating everyone indiscriminately, regardless of age. At first, Xia Yongming heard his two children crying, but then he lost consciousness and heard nothing more.

　　When Xia Yongming woke up, it was already late at night.

　　The room was pitch black. He groped for an oil lamp but couldn't find one, so he lit a piece of pine resin. He saw his old father, wife, and children lying sprawled on the ground. His wife's clothes were torn to shreds, and the two children were huddled in the corner, with a large pool of blood beside them. He touched this one, but it didn't move, and he pushed that one, but it didn't move either. The furniture in the room was smashed to pieces; boxes, basins, pots, nothing was left intact.

　　It was over! In just half a day, Xia Yongming's family had been destroyed by the Kuomintang White Army. He felt dizzy and collapsed next to his wife, his eyes staring blankly at his two children. It seemed like he could never get up again.

　　The broken windows and doors creaked in the wind, and the flames of the pine resin flickered wildly. Suddenly, he noticed something on the ground. He picked it up and saw it was the dog officer's hat, with the "Blue Sky White Sun" emblem pinned on it. Xia Yongming tore off the emblem and smashed it on the ground.

　　The next day, Xia Yongming buried his family, who had died tragically, locked the door, and left.

　　That's how Xia Yongming joined the Red Army.

　　When he first arrived in the army, he was still sad and gloomy. But after fighting the Kuomintang troops several times and seeing that many enemies were eliminated each time, a smile slowly returned to his face, and he became friendly with everyone.

　　Everyone liked him because he did his job so well. Whether garrisoned, marching, or fighting, no matter how fierce the battle, Xia Yongming was sure to provide everyone with meals on time. The food supplies he carried, oil, salt, soy sauce, spoons, bowls, plus his own bamboo hat and flute hanging on both ends of the carrying pole, were sure to weigh twenty or thirty pounds more than what other comrades carried. But no matter how urgent the situation, he would never lose his food supplies.

　　It's interesting to note that my friendship with Xia Yongming began with pot scrapings.

　　When I arrived in the army, he was already an old cook. He cooked especially well, and you could eat several large bowls even without side dishes. Especially the pot scrapings he cooked, which were golden brown. After rinsing the rice, he would bake it for a while, then use the small iron shovel to hit the center of the pot hard, and with a whoosh, the pot scrapings would all fall to the bottom of the pot. He always divided these pot scrapings among the comrades in each platoon who did a good job.

　　One day, after dinner, I passed by the kitchen door and saw a large piece of pot scrapings on the stove. I couldn't resist going in and grabbing a piece. He saw me just as I was putting it in my mouth, and his face darkened:

　　"Little Cai, what are you doing! Didn't you see that the messenger, Little Liu, hasn't returned with the message yet? This is for him!"

　　I saw that and ran away. My running made him laugh, and he said behind me:

　　"Hmph, little devil, you're really naughty!"

　　A few days later, the troops were in Macheng South, supporting the student army coming from Cangzipu. I captured a rifle. Also after dinner, Xia Yongming called me:

　　"Little Cai, come here!"

　　"What for?" I asked him.

　　"Hehe, do you want to eat pot scrapings?"

　　"Of course I want to eat, but are you willing to give me any!"

　　"Haha, you captured a gun, so here you go!" He looked even happier than if he had captured the gun himself.

　　He took out a large piece of pot scrapings, crushed it into small pieces, put it in a large bowl, and poured two spoonfuls of meat broth on it. It was steaming hot. I tasted it and it was really delicious. He watched me eat first, then picked up his black, oily bamboo flute and started playing.

　　I thought, he's congratulating me! Before I could speak, he said: "Little Cai! This is considered a celebration feast for you. Work hard in the future, capture more guns, kill more White bandits, and you'll have pot scrapings to eat!"

　　From then on, we became friends, but if you didn't do a good job, you still couldn't eat pot scrapings.

　　After the Xi'an Incident, in October 1937, the Red Army, which had persisted in guerrilla warfare in Jiangnan for three years, was ordered to be reorganized into the New Fourth Army.

　　After the reorganization, we had to change our clothes and hats. We had to take off the octagonal hat with the red star and put on the hat with the "Blue Sky White Sun" emblem. Everyone was unhappy. We held big meetings and small meetings, and the leaders explained again and again: "We are doing this to unite and resist Japan." Only then did everyone stop saying anything.

　　However, Comrade Xia Yongming just couldn't get over this hurdle.

　　On the day of the uniform change, Old Xia was still wearing his Red Army gray cloth uniform and octagonal hat.

　　The cooking squad leader went to give him a new hat, but he said:

　　"I'm not changing it! I joined the Red Army for this octagonal hat and red star."

　　"The instructor has explained it so many times, didn't you hear! It's for united resistance against Japan!" The cooking squad leader became impatient and tried to change the hat for him.

　　This made him angry. He pushed the cooking squad leader away with one arm, took two steps back, and stared with wide eyes, saying: "I want to see who dares to remove my red star!" It seemed that if anyone took a step forward at this time, he would really punch them.

　　The cooking squad leader was stunned by his shout.

　　A large group of people gathered around, including the company commander and instructor.

　　After everyone dispersed, the instructor chatted with him for a long time before he wrapped up the octagonal hat in paper and cloth and put it away. But he still didn't wear the hat with the "Blue Sky White Sun" emblem.

　　Comrade Xia Yongming worked as a cook in the army for more than ten years. When the army expanded, they asked him to be a management platoon leader, but he said: "I'm not going! I'm good in this role. Let the young people be platoon leaders, they are young and clever."

　　I was separated from Comrade Xia Yongming for a period of time. In 1941, when I was working as a political commissar in the 11th Regiment of the 2nd Division of the New Fourth Army, I met him again. At that time, the base area had expanded, and the local area needed people. The leaders, in order to take care of his age and the inconvenience of working in the army, decided to transfer him to work in the local area. I went to the cooking squad to see him and send him off.

　　Comrade Xia Yongming was still the same old self. It seemed that he had more wrinkles on his forehead, but his spirit seemed a few years younger than before.

　　"Comrade Old Xia." This is how comrades were already addressing him.

　　"Comrade Old Xia, give me another piece of pot scrapings, I won't be able to eat it anymore in the future."

　　"I knew the political commissar would come for pot scrapings." He said, and made me a bowl of pot scrapings with meat broth.

　　"Eat it, I'm leaving. In the future, when you eat pot scrapings, remember me!"

　　He watched me finish eating before he started packing his luggage.

　　We all sent him off a long way before we parted. At the time of the parting, he shook my hand and said, "Political Commissar, I'm leaving. I'll see you again after we defeat the Japanese devils!" He shook hands with everyone, then put on his bamboo hat and walked away, swaying. This reminded me of the way he looked when he was carrying his load and "holding up the rear" of the team.

　　He had already gone far away, but the red star painted on his bamboo hat was still clearly visible to us.

　　革命回忆录谁敢摘掉我的红星
　　少将　蔡炳臣
    1932年那年，夏永明同志已经四十岁了，他长得又胖、又壮，眼睛常眯缝着，一笑起来满脸皱纹都一块往两只眼角旁集中，眼睛就藏到这些皱纹后头了。大嘴唇厚厚的，轻易不说话，说出一句来只几个字，利索、有劲。
    他在连队里做炊事员工作。驻防时，炊事班的活计干完了，他就替这个新战士打双草鞋，再不，就替那个新战士补补衣服。行军时，他挑着伙食担子笑呵呵的跟在连队后面“压阵脚”，谁要是一掉队，他便凑上来说：
    “小伙子是来帮忙来了，还是来和我搭伴呀？”
    这时候掉队的人，就会不好意思的喊一声：“咱们到地方再算帐！”脚上加加劲紧往前面赶。
    夏永明同志参军前家住皖西六安县乡下，家里有父亲、老婆和两个孩子。父亲上了年纪，家里靠他一个人种田过活，苦熬苦挣的勉强混日子。1927年大革命失败之后，国民党军队你来我往，经常在这一带路过，每过一回，刮地三尺，老百姓身上得脱一层皮。到1930年，蒋介石派兵围剿红军，国民党四十六师的队伍一开过来，日子简直一天也活不下去。一天，夏永明家断了粮，他拾上个口袋出去求借，跑了半日还是两手空空。没办法只好饿着肚子回来。到家门口，听见自己老婆在屋子里喊叫。夏永明猛地一惊，准知道家里出了事，顺手摸了根棒子撞进去。屋里，一个喝得醉熏熏的四十六师的军官正扯他老婆衣服，还有一个大兵，把两个孩子坐在腚底下，嘴对着瓶子往肚里灌酒，老爹爹倒在地上断了气。夏永明一见，朝那军官后腰上就是一棒子，打得那家伙叫着栽倒在地上。那大兵见事不好，丢下酒瓶子便跑出去了。夏永明心想：一不做二不休，骑在军官身上一阵暴打。正在这时，那大兵领着十几个人赶来。被打得哼哼呀呀的军官大声喊：“把这一窝子都给我揍死，我看都是红匪。”
    说着，那十几个大兵，早已抡起枪把子来，不分老小一顿乱打。夏永明先还听见两个孩子哭叫，后来昏过去便什么也听不见了。
    等夏永明醒来，已是深夜。
    屋子里一片漆黑，他摸索着找油灯，没找到，拿块松明点着，只见老爹爹、老婆、孩子横躺竖卧倒了一地。老婆的衣服被撕得稀烂，两个孩子挤在墙角里，旁边一大滩血。他摸摸这个，这个一动不动，又推推那个，那个也一动不动。屋里的家什被砸得乱七八糟；箱子，盆子，锅，没剩下一件囫囵的。
    完了！只半天功夫夏永明被国民党白匪军祸害得家破人亡。他只觉得天旋地转，一头跌坐在他老婆身旁，眼睛直楞楞的盯着两个孩子。好像他再也起不来了。
    破碎的窗户、门被风吹得忽哒忽哒响，松明的火苗一劲跳闪。他忽然在地上发现了什么，拾起来看，原来是那个狗军官的帽子，上面钉着个“青天白日”的帽徽。夏永明将帽徽揪下来，狠狠的摔在地下。
    第二天，夏永明把惨死的一家老小掩埋起来，反锁上门走了。
    就这么的，夏永明参加了红军。
    他刚到部队时，还是愁眉苦脸的，和国民党部队打了几次仗之后，看见每回都消灭很多敌人，慢慢的脸上才有了笑容，变得和谁都亲亲热热的了。
    大家都喜欢他，因为他工作作的特别好。不管驻防、行军、打仗，也不管战斗多么激烈，夏永明准能给大伙按时开饭。他挑的伙食担子，油盐酱醋，勺盆碗，外加上他自己挂在扁担两头的斗笠和竹笛，准比别的同志挑的重二三十斤，但，不管情况怎样紧急，也丢不掉他的伙食担子。
    说起来很有意思，我和夏永明的交情，是从锅巴开始的。
    我到部队时，他已经是个老炊事员了。他烧饭烧的特别好，没有菜也能吃几大碗。特别是他烧饭烧出的锅巴，焦黄焦黄的。他淘完饭，再烙一会，用锄饭的小铁锨在锅中心使劲一敲，哗一声，锅巴都掉在锅底上。他总是把这些锅巴分给各排工作好的同志吃。
    一天，吃完晚饭我从伙房门前过，看锅台上一大块锅巴，忍不住进去捞了一块，刚往嘴里填，叫他看见了，他把脸一沉：
    “小蔡，做啥！没看见通讯员小刘送信还没回来，这是给他留的！”
    我一看撒腿就跑，这一跑倒把他逗笑了，他在我身后说了一句：
    “哼，小鬼，真挑皮！”
    不几天，部队在麻城南打沧子铺来增援的学生军，我缴了一支步枪。也是吃完晚饭之后，夏永明喊我：
    “小蔡，你来！”
    “做什么？”我过去问他。
    “嘿嘿，你想吃锅巴吗？”
    “怎么不想吃，你舍得给呀！”
    “哈，缴了枪吗，给你！”看他那个样子，比他缴了枪还高兴。
    他拿出来一大块锅巴，一点一点捣碎了放在一个大碗里，还给浇上两勺肉汤，热气腾腾的。我一尝真香。他先看着我吃，一会拿起他的黑油油的竹笛来吹上了。
    我寻思，这是给我贺喜呢！没等我开口他说了：“小蔡！这算给你摆庆功宴了，往后好好干，多缴枪、多杀白匪，有得锅巴吃！”
    从此我们俩有了交情，不过工作不好时，一样吃不着锅巴。
    西安事变之后，1937年10月，我们在江南坚持了三年游击战争的红军，奉命改编成新四军。
    改编之后，要换衣服，换帽子。要把钉着红五星的八角帽摘下来，换上带有“青天白日”帽徽的帽子，大家思想都不痛快。开大会，开小会，领导上再三再四的解释：“我们是为了团结抗战”，大家才不再说什么了。
    可是，夏永明同志，怎么的也抹不过来这个弯。
    换衣服这天，老夏还照旧，穿着红军的灰土布衣服，戴着八角帽。
    伙食班长去给他换帽子，他说：
    “我不换！我当红军就是冲着这八角帽和红五星来的。”
    “指导员讲了多少遍了，你没听呀！团结抗日吗！”伙食班长讲得不耐烦了，动手替他换。
    这下子他可火了，一胳臂将伙食班长拨开，往后退了两步，瞪着大眼睛说：“我看谁敢来摘我的红星！”看样子这时谁要往前走一步，他真会一拳给打回来。
    伙食班长叫他这一喊楞住了。
    这一吵闹围上来一大帮人，连长、指导员都来了。
    大家散了之后，指导员和他唠了半天，他才把八角帽纸包布裹的收起来。可是，有“青天白日”帽徽的帽子他还是没戴。
    夏永明同志在部队中作炊事员工作，一直作了十多年。队伍扩大了，叫他去当管理排长，他说：“我不去！我这角色很好，排长让给年青人吧，他们年纪小伶俐。”
    我和夏永明同志分别了一个时期，1941年我在新四军二师十一团担任政委工作时，又和他遇在一起了。那时候根据地扩大了，地方上需要人，领导上为了照顾他年龄大，在部队上工作不方便，确定把他转到地方上去工作。我到炊事班去看他，给他送行。
    夏永明同志还是那个老样，前额上好像多了几条皱纹，看他的精神又像比以前年青了几岁。
    “老夏同志。”现在同志们已经这样称呼他了。
    “老夏同志，再给块锅巴吃吧，往后要吃不成了。”
    “我知道政委来准得要锅巴吃。”他说着给我泡了一碗肉汤锅巴。
    “吃吧，我要走了，以后吃锅巴时，可想着我！”
    他看着我吃完了才去收拾行李。
    我们大家一直送了他好远才分手，分手时他握着我的手说，“政委，我走了，等打完鬼子再见！”他和大家挨个握了手，然后戴上那斗笠摇晃着走去。这使我想起了他挑着担子，跟在队伍后“压阵角”时的样子。
    他都走得很远了，斗笠上画着的一颗红星我们还看的真真的。
