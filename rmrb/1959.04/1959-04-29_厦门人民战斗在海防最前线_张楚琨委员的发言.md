Xiamen People Fight on the Forefront of Coastal Defense
Speech by Committee Member Zhang Chukun

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I come from Xiamen, the forefront of coastal defense. Please allow me to report on the struggle and production situation of the people of Xiamen.

Facing Jinmen and Taiwan, the people of Xiamen have been fighting amidst artillery fire for ten years! Children are born amidst the shelling, and the younger generation has grown up under the tempering of artillery fire. The entire city has become accustomed to production, construction, and study amidst the artillery fire, and everyone has a glorious sense of responsibility. The People's Liberation Army stands on the front line of the struggle, supported by the people of the whole country, standing closely with us. We are at the outpost of defending the motherland, at the outpost of liberating Jinmen and Taiwan, and at the outpost of defending peace.

Xiamen People Do Not Neglect Supporting the Front While Maintaining Production

August 23, 1958, was a day of historical significance for the people of Xiamen. From that day on, the heroic PLA troops stationed in Xiamen and neighboring areas expressed the will of the people of the whole country, using the powerful force of artillery fire to punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Jinmen and strike at the military threats and war provocations of US imperialism. In more than two months of fighting, the army, navy, and air force cooperated and achieved the brilliant military and political victories that everyone knows. The people of Xiamen have never been so happy. Under the action slogan of "Everything for the front, everything for victory," all forces were mobilized to fight for the sacred goal of defending the motherland, liberating Jinmen, Mazu, Penghu, and Taiwan, and completing the unification of the motherland. The entire city quickly realized universal conscription, forming a militia force of more than 180,000 people. Stretcher teams, rescue teams, fire brigades, and blood transfusion teams were seen everywhere. The song that the masses loved to sing most was: "When the motherland needs us, we pick up our guns." Barbers, postmen, shop assistants, etc., went to the front line to serve and became heroic figures. On the front line, in addition to the elderly, weak, and young who were evacuated to the rear, young men and women delivered artillery shells to the PLA, built roads, assisted in repairing fortifications, delivered boiling water amidst artillery fire, and washed and mended clothes. Many backbone militiamen lived, ate, and fought alongside the combat troops, becoming part of the combat troops. In the front-line people's communes alone, many heroic figures loyal to the motherland and loyal to the Party emerged, including the well-known "Little Eight Route Army Soldiers," "Ten Sisters," "Twenty-Three Warriors," "Eighteen Good Men," "Seven Aunts," "Nine Show Class," "Mu Guiying Group," "Ten Front-Line Militiamen," and 21 units with 248 people and six warriors.

The homes of the front-line people were destroyed by enemy artillery fire, but the people's enthusiasm for production could not be destroyed. The children of the Front-Line People's Commune, established in September 1958, persisted in supporting the front and maintaining production on that land where there was a shrapnel fragment on every square meter, and they achieved a bumper harvest. They mastered the enemy's artillery firing patterns to formulate strategies, that is, when the enemy was pressing, they relaxed, and when the enemy relaxed, they pressed. The action slogan was: "Fight hard and rest, fight lightly and don't stop, don't fight and work hard; fight during the day, work at night, fight here, work there." The measures were "decentralized production, digging caves in the fields." In 1958, the average yield of grain per mu was 808 jin, an increase of 37 percent compared to 1957, and it created the highest record of planting area in history. The yield of oyster meat per mu of small oysters was 4,320 jin, which was the best result in the province on the beach facing the enemy island. In the mass steelmaking movement, 82,024 jin of enemy shrapnel were collected and 83,022 jin of steel were refined, winning first place in the suburbs. The strong vitality of the people's commune was fully demonstrated. When the artillery fire was at its heaviest, tens of thousands of production workers, construction workers, and transportation workers also worked most vigorously. The general line of socialist construction inspired them, and they used practical actions of building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way with "high yield, over-fulfillment, technological innovation, and increased labor productivity" to repay the meritorious deeds of the front-line PLA in defending socialist construction. Relying on the correct leadership of the Party and the soaring enthusiasm of the working class, Xiamen City overfulfilled its industrial production plan in 1958, which was a repeated great leap forward, increasing by 1.34 times compared to 1957. The total amount of investment in capital construction completed throughout the year was approximately equal to the sum of the first Five-Year Plan. The mass steelmaking movement ended Xiamen's history of being "unarmed." Currently, efforts are being concentrated on building a satellite city—the Xinglin Industrial Zone, where more than a dozen modern factories of considerable scale will appear, including eight above quota: including the Xiamen Comprehensive Glass Factory, one of the six major glass factories in the country; the first mechanized textile factory in Fujian Province; and the Xiamen Soda Ash Factory, which produces 160,000 tons of soda ash annually. Building a large-scale, modern comprehensive industrial base amidst the continuous tense situation of artillery fire manufactured by the enemy is the glorious and arduous task of the people of Xiamen at present.

The people of Xiamen have used their hands to move mountains and fill the sea, building the 2.2-kilometer Xiamen Seawall and the 2.8-kilometer Jimei Seawall, and now they are building the third seawall. This seawall is 1.6 kilometers long and is used to enclose a chemical raw material base. The deep water parts of this port are all 11 meters below sea level. Building a site in such a deep bay is rare in the country, but more than 4,000 heroic builders, under the slogan of "Competing with the heavens for time, competing with the sea for profit, ordering the Dragon King to cede land and offer treasures," have already overcome the tides and mudflats, and have begun to close the gap, and will be basically completed and put into production by the end of the year. This is another triumphant song of the people of Xiamen marching into the ocean amidst artillery fire!

Xiamen is also developing cultural, educational, and sports undertakings amidst the artillery fire. According to the Party's policy of "education serving politics and education combined with productive labor," illiteracy was eliminated, and primary and secondary schools were popularized during the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958. Xiamen University, which is only more than 5,000 meters away from the enemy's outpost, persisted in scientific research and running factories even when the enemy was bombing frantically. The Fourth Central Primary School in He厝 Township on the front line persisted in learning amidst the artillery fire. Sports undertakings have advanced by leaps and bounds. Sampan rowing: men's 2,000 meters. Cycling: men's 100 kilometers and women's 25 kilometers have all set world records.

Returned Overseas Chinese and Their Relatives are Good Sons and Daughters of the Motherland

Xiamen is an old port where overseas Chinese enter and leave the country and has extremely close relations with overseas Chinese. More than 50,000 returned overseas Chinese and their relatives living in Xiamen City, like the people of the whole city, have shown unparalleled bravery and soaring enthusiasm, whether in supporting the front, fighting against the enemy, or in production and construction. Among the 7,518 households with 34,584 people in the Front-Line People's Commune mentioned above, there are 1,544 overseas Chinese households with 7,055 people. Among the activists who persisted in production and fighting against the enemy in each village, many are returned overseas Chinese or their relatives. For example, Lin Shaoyang, one of the "Seven Aunts," is a returned overseas Chinese from the Philippines, and the young militiaman Su Wenrou is a relative of an overseas Chinese. She attended the enlarged meeting of the First All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (November 1958) as a red flag bearer. He Xueqin, He Xuezhen, He Xuehua, He Qionglin of the "Ten Front-Line Sisters," Huang Bingtu and Huang Jianli of the "Ten Front-Line Militiamen," Chen Xianqing and Chen Shubin of the "Mu Guiying Class," Sun Guihui of the "Nine Show Class" are also all relatives of overseas Chinese; He Jinzhi of the "Little Eight Route Army Soldiers" returned from Vietnam.

Among the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, there have been many moving cases of entire families participating in the battle. The family of Lin Shenci, a Philippine overseas Chinese relative in Gaolin Village, is one of them: Shenci is the militia platoon leader, his younger brother Chengqi is the instructor, and his cousin Chenggong is the deputy company commander. The three brothers transport stones to repair fortifications at night and go to the fields to produce during the day. All three were named activists who persisted in production and fighting against the enemy. Chen Qinglian, a Vietnamese returned overseas Chinese in Zhuang厝 Village, has a pair of good children, Quanpao (militia squad leader, excellent commune member) and Quanying (15 years old, helped the troops repair fortifications for a month and was commended by the troops), who are both good sons and daughters of the motherland.

Mr. Chen Jiageng is extremely concerned about the socialist construction of Xiamen. After liberation, he built nearly 60,000 square meters of school buildings for Xiamen University, which he founded, and personally presided over the construction of the Jimei Cultural District. During the days of punishing Jinmen with artillery fire, the Overseas Chinese Museum was basically completed, and the construction of the Jimei Tidal Power Station, which he pioneered, was accelerated. This experimental project is an innovation in our country and Asia.

The enthusiasm of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives for participating in socialist construction has been continuously praised. More than 60 returned overseas Chinese students who voluntarily found employment from Jimei Middle School and Jimei Overseas Chinese School, during their participation in the construction of the Zhongzhai Salt Field, witnessed many moving cases that shocked the laborers, and their evaluation always ranked among the top. In addition, when the water diversion project from Gaoqi to Heshan was at its most tense stage, hundreds of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, who "did not work with their limbs and did not carry burdens on their shoulders," responded to the call of the Party and boldly participated in voluntary labor. They took off their silk clothes, high heels, and gold bracelets, picked up hoes, carried soil, and lived on the construction site. Their labor enthusiasm and heroic spirit were praised by the masses.

Heroic City, Heroic People

The people of the whole country have bestowed the honor of "heroic city, heroic people" upon Xiamen and the people of Xiamen. However, the people of Xiamen feel that they have only fulfilled a little bit of their responsibility, and not even well enough, and it is really nothing. As a servant of the people, I deeply understand the truth of this psychology of the masses. The victory on the front line of Xiamen is a part of the great military, political, diplomatic, and economic victory of our country, and it should be attributed to the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and to the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country. The three are inseparable. China is a heroic country. As long as there is the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, wherever there is fighting, there will be a heroic city, and the people there will be heroic people. Therefore, the victory of the people of Xiamen is the victory of the leadership of the Party, and it is the common victory of the people of the whole country!

Recently, the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary clique in the upper strata launched an armed rebellion and abducted the Dalai Lama to India. The military and civilians on the front line felt extremely angry and resolutely supported the Central People's Government in completely suppressing the rebellion. Moreover, they are prepared and alert to any蠢动 of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

Chairman Mao's great document "All imperialists and reactionaries are paper tigers" powerfully armed the people on the front line, enabling us to see the United States and Chiang Kai-shek more clearly and have stronger confidence in victory. We must tighten the noose! We must smash the conspiracy of US imperialism to create two Chinas! We must liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan!

    厦门人民战斗在海防最前线
    张楚琨委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我来自海防最前线的厦门，请允许我把厦门人民的斗争情况和生产情况汇报一下。
    面对着金门、台湾的厦门人民，战斗在炮火中，十年了！孩子们在炮声中诞生，年青一代在炮火的锻炼中成长起来，全市人民已经习
  惯于在炮火中生产、建设和学习，并且都具有光荣的责任感。人民解放军站在斗争的最前线，全国人民支援我们，和我们紧紧在一起，我们是在保卫祖国的前哨，在解放金门、台湾的前哨，在保卫和平的前哨。
    厦门人民支前生产两不误
    一九五八年八月二十三日，对于厦门人民说来，是一个具有历史意义的日子。从这一天起，英勇的中国人民解放军驻厦部队和邻区部队，表达了全国人民的意志，用强大的炮火威力惩罚了金门的蒋军，打击了美帝国主义的军事威胁和战争挑衅，在两个多月的战斗里，陆海空三军协同作战，取得了大家知道的军事上和政治上的辉煌胜利。厦门人民从来没有这样高兴过。在“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利”的行动口号下，所有力量都动员起来了，为保卫祖国解放金、马、澎、台完成祖国统一的神圣目标而奋斗。全市很快地实现了全民皆兵，组成了十八万余人的民兵队伍。到处都看到担架队，救护队，消防队，输血队。群众最爱唱的一支歌是：“当祖国需要我们的时候，就拿起了枪。”理发师、邮递员、售货员等都上火线服务，成了英雄人物。在前沿除了老弱幼小的疏散到后防去以外，男女青年都为解放军送炮弹、筑公路、协修工事、冒着炮火送开水、洗补衣服，不少基干民兵和作战部队同住同吃同战斗，成了战斗部队的一部分。仅在前线人民公社，就涌现出许多忠于祖国、忠于党的英雄人物，其中有知名的“小八路”、“十姐妹”、“二十三勇士”、“十八好汉”、“七大娘”、“九秀班”、“穆桂英小组”、“前沿十民兵”等二十一个单位二百四十八人和六名勇士。
    前沿人民的家园给敌人的炮火烧毁了，但是人民的生产干劲却毁不了。一九五八年九月间成立的前线人民公社的儿女们在那每平方公尺有一块弹片的土地上，坚持支前、生产两不误，获得了丰收。他们掌握敌人打炮的规律来制定策略，即“敌紧我松，敌松我紧”时的行动口号是：“大打休息，小打不停，不打大干；白天打，晚上干，这边打，那边干”；措施是“分散生产，田间挖洞”。一九五八年全年粮食平均亩产八百零八斤，比一九五七年增加百分之三十七，并创造了历年来种植面积的最高纪录。小蚝亩产蚝肉四千三百二十斤，是在和敌岛对峙的海滩上出现的全省最优成绩。在全民炼钢运动中，拣了敌人炮弹片八万二千零二十四斤，炼出钢八万三千零二十二斤，获得郊区第一。人民公社的强大生命力充分显示出来。当炮火打得最密，数万生产工人、基建工人和运输工人也干得最起劲。社会主义建设的总路线鼓舞着他们，他们用“高产，超额完成，技术革新，提高劳动生产率”多快好省的建设社会主义实际行动，来报答前沿解放军保卫社会主义建设的丰功伟绩。依靠党的正确领导和工人阶级的冲天干劲，厦门市一九五八年的工业超额完成了，一再跃进的生产计划，比一九五七年增加一点三四倍。全年完成的基本建设投资额约等于第一个五年计划的总和。全民炼钢结束了厦门“手无寸铁”的历史。目前正在集中力量建设卫星城——杏林工业区，这里将出现十多个具有相当规模的现代化工厂，其中限额以上有八个：包括全国六大玻璃厂之一的厦门综合玻璃厂；福建省第一座机械化的纺织厂；年产十六万吨纯碱的厦门纯碱厂。在敌人一手制造的炮火连绵紧张局势中，建设一个有相当规模的、现代化的综合性工业基地，这就是厦门人民当前一个光荣而又艰巨的任务。
    厦门人民曾经用双手移山填海，建造了二点二公里的厦门海堤和二点八公里的集美海堤，现在又建造第三条海堤。这条海堤一点六公里，用来围建一个化工原料基地。这个港深水部位都在海平线十一公尺以下，在这样深的海湾建场，全国少见，但四千多名英雄的建设者，在“与天争时，与海争利，命令龙王，割地献宝”的口号下，已经战胜了潮水和烂滩，开始堵口，将于年底基本建成并投入生产。这是厦门人民在炮火中向海洋进军的又一支凯歌！
    厦门还在炮火中发展文教事业和体育事业。根据党的“教育为政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，在一九五八年全面大跃进中，扫清了文盲，普及了小学和初中。距离敌人前哨只有五千多公尺的厦门大学，在敌人疯狂炮轰的时候，仍然坚持科学研究和办厂。前沿何厝乡第四中心小学坚持火线学习。体育事业突飞猛进，舢板荡桨：男子二千公尺。自行车：男子一百公里和女子二十五公里都创造了世界纪录。
    归侨侨眷是祖国的好儿女
    厦门是一个华侨出入国的老口岸，和华侨关系极为密切。住在厦门市的五万多归侨、侨眷，同全市人民一样，无论在支前、对敌斗争中，或在生产建设中，都表现了无比英勇和冲天干劲。前面所说的前线人民公社七千五百一十八户三万四千五百八十四人之中，就有侨户一千五百四十四户七千零五十五人。在各村所评出的坚持生产、对敌斗争的积极分子中有不少是归侨或侨眷。如“七大娘”之一的林沙央就是菲律宾归侨，青年民兵苏温柔就是侨眷，她曾以红旗手的身分出席了全国侨联一届三次全体委员扩大会议（一九五八年十一月）；“前沿十姐妹”中的何雪琴、何雪珍、何雪花、何琼玲，“前沿十民兵”中的黄炳土、黄建利，“穆桂英班”的陈羡卿、陈淑彬，“九秀班”的孙秀惠也都是侨属；“小八路”的何锦治是从越南回来的。
    在归侨、侨眷中，出现了不少举家参加战斗的动人事例。高林村菲律宾侨眷林神赐家是其中之一：神赐是民兵排长，胞弟成器是指导员，堂弟成功是副连长，三兄弟夜里运石头修工事，白天下地生产，都被评为坚持生产、对敌斗争的积极分子。庄厝村越南归侨陈清廉的一对好儿女，全抛（民兵班长，优秀社员）和全英（十五岁，帮部队修工事连干一个月，受到部队嘉奖）都是祖国的好儿女。
    陈嘉庚先生对于厦门的社会主义建设异常关心。他在解放后为他所创办的厦门大学建筑了近六万平方公尺的校舍，亲自主持集美文化区的建设。在炮惩金门的日子里，基本建成了华侨博物院，同时加紧进行他所首倡的集美潮汐发电站的工程，这个试验性工程，无论在我国或亚洲都是一个创举。
    归侨、侨眷参加社会主义建设的积极性，不断受到表扬。集美中学和集美侨校的六十多位自愿就业的归国华侨学生，在参加建设钟宅盐场的劳动中，出现许多震动全场民工的动人事例，评比总是名列前茅。另外，当高崎到禾山的自来水引水工程进行到最紧张的时候，数百个“四体不勤，肩不着挑”的归侨侨眷，响应了党的号召，豪迈地参加了义务劳动，她们脱下绸衣、高跟鞋和金手镯，拿起锄头，挑起土，住在工地上，她们的劳动热情和英雄气概受到群众的称赞。
    英雄的城市　英雄的人民
    全国人民把“英雄的城市，英雄的人民”的荣誉加于厦门和厦门人民的身上。厦门人民却觉得自己不过尽了一点儿责任，而且尽得不够好，实在不算什么。作为人民的勤务员，我深深了解群众这种心理的真实性。厦门前线的胜利，是我国军事上、政治上、外交上、经济上伟大胜利的一部分，应该归功于伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导，归功于中国人民解放军的英勇战斗，归功于全国人民的热烈支援，三者密不可分。中国是一个英雄的国度，只要有伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导，那里发生战斗，那里就成为英雄的城市，那里的人民就是英雄的人民。因此，厦门人民的胜利，就是党的领导的胜利，就是全国人民的共同胜利！
    最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动武装叛乱，将达赖喇嘛劫往印度，前线军民感到无比的愤怒，坚决拥护中央人民政府彻底平息叛乱，并且，枕戈待旦，警惕着美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的任何蠢动。
    毛主席的论断“一切帝国主义和反动派都是纸老虎”的伟大文献，有力地武装了前线人民，使我们对美蒋看得更清楚，胜利的信心更强，我们一定要拉紧绞索！一定要粉碎美帝国主义制造两个中国的阴谋！一定要解放金门、马祖、台湾！
