　　Seize the Opportunity, Catch Fish and Shrimp in Large Quantities

    The peak season for ocean fishing has arrived, and delicious and fleshy fish and shrimp are migrating in large groups from afar. According to the migratory patterns of fish schools, marine fishing is highly seasonal. Coastal areas must seize the opportunity to mobilize the masses to fish in large quantities.

    This year's production plan for marine aquatic products has increased compared to last year. The planned output for the second quarter accounts for a particularly large proportion of the annual plan, generally accounting for about 40% of the annual plan for coastal provinces and cities. Therefore, this quarter is a critical one. Marine aquatic products are an important export commodity for our country. Exporting one ton of frozen prawns can exchange for more than eleven tons of steel. Producing and exporting more fish and shrimp is beneficial to national construction. On the other hand, as the living standards of our people continue to improve, the domestic market demand for aquatic products is also increasing. Catching more fish and shrimp and appropriately increasing supply will also play an important role in improving the supply of non-staple foods in cities and industrial and mining areas.

    In order to seize the opportunity to complete the marine fishing tasks, coastal provinces and cities should, in accordance with the State Council's notice on seizing the marine fishing season to capture, purchase, and transport prawns, yellow croaker, and other aquatic products, further strengthen the organizational leadership of the fishing work during the fishing season. Under the leadership of the main responsible comrades, relevant departments such as aquatic products, commerce, transportation, and meteorology should form a unified combat headquarters. All fishing boats and labor that can go to sea must be quickly organized and put into fishing work. For the currently insufficient supply of fishing supplies, every effort must be made to increase the supply. Some places have already gained some effective experiences in this regard, which are worth learning from in various places: Party and government responsible comrades in Fujian, Zhejiang, Liaoning, Shandong, Guangdong and other provinces have convened meetings of relevant departments to make overall arrangements for the supply of fishing supplies; at the same time, through inventorying and mobilizing the masses, many communes and production teams have cleared out a batch of old nets from their original warehouses, and many fishermen have also voluntarily lent private timber, nets, etc. to the communes for use. In short, as long as the masses are fully mobilized, consulted more with the masses, and relied on the masses to do things, difficulties can be overcome.

    When organizing fishermen to catch fish and shrimp, all localities must also conduct safety production education, closely contact with meteorological departments, strengthen typhoon warning work, and do a good job in safety preparation and inspection work before going to sea to ensure safe production.

    Now, on the basis of further implementing the policies of unified leadership, decentralized management, and distribution according to work under the unified leadership of the people's communes, the production enthusiasm of fishermen has been unprecedentedly high; and the Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over fishery production, and the preparations for the fishing season have been basically completed in various places, and many fishing boats have already gone to sea ahead of schedule. These are all favorable conditions for increasing production. Although this year's production, procurement, export, transportation and other tasks are arduous, as long as all localities can give full play to the positive factors in all aspects, the various tasks in the second quarter will definitely be completed.

### 抓紧时机，大捕鱼虾

　　抓紧时机，大捕鱼虾
    海洋渔汛的旺季到来了，味美肉鲜的鱼虾，正从远方群游而来。根据鱼群的回游规律，海洋捕捞的季节性特别强。沿海地区必须紧紧抓住时机，发动群众大力捕捞。
    今年海洋水产品的生产计划，比去年有所增加。第二季度的计划产量在全年计划中占的比重特别大，一般占沿海各省市全年计划的40％左右。因此，这一季度是关键性的季度。海洋水产品是我国出口的一项重要物资，出口一吨冻对虾，可以换取十一吨多的钢材。多生产并多出口一些鱼虾，对于国家建设是有利的。另一方面，我国人民生活水平不断提高，国内市场对水产品需要量也不断增加。多捕鱼虾，适当增加供应，对改善城市、工矿区的副食品供应也将起重要作用。
    为了抓紧时机完成海洋捕捞任务，沿海省市应该根据国务院关于抓紧海洋渔汛期间对虾、黄花鱼和其他水产品的捕捞、收购、调运工作的通知，进一步加强对汛期捕捞工作的组织领导，在主要负责同志掌握下，把水产、商业、交通、气象等有关部门，组成统一的战斗指挥部。要把可以下海的渔船和劳力，迅速全部组织起来，投入捕捞工作。对于目前供应不足的渔需物资，要千方百计地设法增加供应。有些地方在这方面已有了一些行之有效的经验，值得各地借鉴：福建、浙江、辽宁、山东、广东等省的党政负责同志曾召集有关部门的会议，统筹安排渔需物资的供应；同时，经过清查家底和发动群众，许多公社、生产队从原有仓库中清查出来一批旧网具，还有不少渔民自愿把私有的木料、网具等借给公社用。总之，只要充分发动群众，多同群众商量，依靠群众办事，困难都是可以克服的。
    各地在组织渔民捕捞鱼虾的时候，还必须进行安全生产的教育，并与气象部门密切联系，加强暴风警报工作，出海前要做好安全准备和检查工作，以保证安全生产。
    现在，在人民公社统一领导、分级管理和按劳分配的政策进一步贯彻的基础上，渔民生产积极性空前高涨；各级党委又加强了对渔业生产的领导，汛期的准备工作各地都已基本完成，许多渔船已经提前出海。这些都是增加生产的有利条件。虽然今年的生产、收购、出口、调运等任务是艰巨的，只要各地能够充分发挥各方面的积极因素，第二季度的各项任务一定能够完成。
