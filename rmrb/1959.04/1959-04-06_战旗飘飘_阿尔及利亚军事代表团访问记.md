    The Battle Flag Waves
    ——A Visit to the Algerian Military Delegation
    By our reporters Zhou Zemin and Ding Gu
    One drizzly spring afternoon, with the utmost respect, we visited the Algerian Military Delegation, representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Army, who came to our country for a friendly visit at the invitation of Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of our country.
    Commander Omar Oussedik and others received us in the meeting room. This commander, who had only recently left the war-torn Algerian front, introduced to us with a tone and gestures full of victorious confidence, the victorious situation of the Algerian national liberation movement, which was advancing victoriously like a prairie fire, and the magnificent scenes of the heroic Algerian people and the National Liberation Army fighting hard and stubbornly attacking the enemy: from border to border, from mountain to desert, Algerian battle flags fluttered everywhere. The heroic people are persisting in fighting and striding forward to the final victory.
      "Today, the entire Algerian people are fighting against the French colonial army. From north to south, the National Liberation Army has almost controlled the entire country. The front is gradually shifting from the vast rural areas and mountainous areas to towns and transportation lines. Now, our entire army and people are in high spirits and are making every effort to seize the final victory; while the enemy is at the end of its rope, with casualties and losses becoming more and more severe, facing the eve of final defeat," Commander Omar Oussedik told us excitedly. This is the characteristic of the current Algerian national liberation movement.
    Commander Omar Oussedik said:
      "This situation started in 1958. In 1959, there was even more significant development. Now, we have not only carried out effective political control nationwide, the National Liberation Army organizations are all over the country, the base areas and guerrilla areas are constantly expanding, and even in some big cities, guerrilla teams have grown up. This makes the French invading troops and colonial troops uneasy day and night. They are attacked every day, paying a great deal of casualties and losses. According to internal French materials, the war expenses used by the enemy to invade Algeria reached a maximum of 4 billion francs per day. This figure is equivalent to twice the 2 billion francs of the highest daily war expenses that France used in the Indochina War in the past. This does not include the casualties of the invading army personnel and the loss of heavy equipment and military facilities. At the end of last year, the Algerian National Liberation Army broke through the 'Morice Line', the line of defense that the French colonial army once boasted as 'impregnable', which was more than 300 kilometers long and half a kilometer wide. This fact powerfully marked the increase of our army's combat power and the beginning of the enemy's collapse."
      "Of course, the victory of the Algerian people was not easily won. The struggle is arduous. The closer imperialism gets to its death, the more frantically it behaves. The French colonialists' suppression of the Algerian people is very cruel. They have reached the point of exterminating humanity. On the one hand, they use 600,000 modern armed forces and 200,000 police troops to carry out frenzied massacres and great destruction in Algeria day and night. At the same time, they also set up 'death camps' and prisons all over Algeria, cruelly persecuting people from all walks of life. They burn, kill, loot, rape women, bomb villages, create 'death no-man's lands', burn forests, orchards, and crops, and do all kinds of evil. They forbid farmers to cultivate the land, throwing a large number of Algerian people onto the starvation line. In the past four years, they have killed 800,000 Algerian men, women, and children, thrown 150,000 patriotic people into prisons, and imprisoned 1.5 million Algerians in death camps. In order to eliminate the Algerian nation, the invaders forcibly sterilized Algerian young men and women, and injected 'death needles' into children aged one to four. In two villages in southern Algeria, 88 children were injected one day and were all taken away from their mothers' arms by death the next day...."
    Commander Omar Oussedik's tone gradually lowered, with deep mourning for the suffering people. Outside the window, the sky was gloomy and drizzling. We were also filled with infinite respect and sympathy for the heroic people, and our eyes were moist.
    Suddenly, Commander Omar Oussedik stood up from the sofa, waved his fist excitedly, and said loudly, but the Algerian people are unyielding. They are retaliating against the invaders with bullets and bombs every day. From the Tunisian border to the Moroccan border, from Greater Kabylia in the north to the southern border, the fire of resisting aggression and striving for independence has been ignited everywhere, and everyone is a warrior fighting against the French invading army.
    Then, Commander Omar Oussedik introduced to us with proud feelings the heroic battle deeds of the Algerian National Liberation Army and militias, guerrillas, and the people.
    Commander Omar Oussedik first introduced to us the moving deeds of Delegate Member, Major Azzedine, commander of the Fourth War Zone of Algeria. A day later, we met this hero who is famous throughout Algeria.
    This is a young military officer from a steel worker background, only twenty-five years old this year. His complexion is slightly yellowish and thin, but his eyebrows are full of heroism. He has been wounded thirteen times, and there are still three American-made bullets buried deep in his lower back. He was captured twice due to injuries, but he has always been loyal and unyielding, and has never stopped fighting for a moment. On October 10, 1955, he led eleven soldiers into the enemy-occupied area to open up a base area. In one fell swoop, they removed an enemy bunker and wiped out 20 French troops. On July 14, 1956, when he was being treated for war wounds in a hospital, he encountered a major enemy mop-up operation. The hospital was surrounded. He killed two French troops with two hand grenades. Because his right leg was seriously injured, he could not escape and was captured by the French army after being shot three times in the leg. He spent three months in the Tablat French military prison. After his wounds healed, he organized a riot in prison and, together with a dozen fellow prisoners, beat a guard to death with wooden sticks, captured three guards, and broke out of prison. The French army then chased after them. They fled into a small market town that was holding a fair. When the people found out that they were soldiers of the National Liberation Army, they immediately took off their clothes and exchanged them for their prison clothes. A shepherd handed them a flock of sheep and asked them to pretend to be shepherds driving the sheep out of town. A large number of citizens immediately fled in the opposite direction to lure the French army to chase after the large crowds. They calmly escaped from danger and returned to the troops.
    On August 4, 1957, in the Ouled Touati area, more than 70 kilometers south of Algiers, he led 111 daredevils to launch an attack on an enemy-occupied village. When they were concentrating in Bouzeza after completing their mission, they were surrounded by 15,000 French troops commanded by three French generals, Massu, Aland, and Simon. The enemy dispatched various aircraft such as American-made B25, B26, and B29 to bomb them frantically. Then, the French army launched a full-scale offensive. Azzedine commanded all the daredevils to repel the enemy's charge from the high mountains, and bravely charged into the enemy's positions, rampaging through the enemy's heartland for a day. The enemy was thrown into chaos and confusion. At night, they broke through the encirclement, seized a large number of guns and ammunition, and captured thirty-four prisoners. This battle brought great encouragement to the people in this enemy-occupied area located on the edge of the big city of Algiers. They said, "A steel worker (referring to Azzedine) can defeat three French generals, we will definitely win." Major Azzedine said, "The enemy can destroy our villages with airplanes, flatten our cities with tanks, and kill me, but they will never be able to make us lay down our weapons. We will not stop fighting until Algeria is liberated."
    Major Slimane, commander of the Algerian Sahara region, who was also from a peasant background, also introduced to us the heroic struggle story of the National Liberation Army's surprise attack on the enemy in the Sahara Desert to plunder Algerian oil.
      "It is completely impossible for the French colonialists to use military force to ensure that oil is continuously transported out of Algeria," said Major Slimane. Once, our small troop of forty young people marched for three days and three nights, inserted into the center of the Sahara Desert, and gave the enemy a surprise attack. Although the oil mining area here has a French reinforced division, and there are airplanes patrolling in the air, most of the oil pipelines and machines in the mining area were still destroyed by us. Hundreds of the defending French troops were killed or wounded by our army. Seven French officers became our prisoners. When the enemy mobilized a large number of troops in an attempt to retaliate, this strong small troop had already disintegrated and cooperated with the local armed forces to destroy the French army's oil train on another transportation line.
    Major Slimane said that such incidents happen almost every day in Algeria. In order to protect the oil transportation line, which is hundreds of kilometers long, the French military authorities concentrated seventy French regular divisions, air force units, and helicopters in this area. The French army built thousands of fortresses on both sides of the railway line, set up minefields and barbed wire, and motorized patrols patrolled day and night. But all this could not stop the activities of the Algerian people. In the half year from July 1 to the end of December last year alone, the Algerian National Liberation Army attacked oil trains fifty-two times, destroyed forty-eight oil-filled trains, and destroyed twelve railway facilities and water towers of great military value, killing and wounding more than 3,500 French troops. Major Slimane said, "The French generals have to admit that our army's repeated attacks on the oil transportation line have made them feel particularly terrible."
      "The source of our strength and victory comes from the people." Commander Omar Oussedik and Major Azzedine, when talking about the reasons for their victory, repeatedly emphasized the fine tradition of unity and common struggle between the Algerian military and civilians. They said that in Algeria, the army lives among the people. The people's love and support for the army is meticulous. The officers and soldiers of the Liberation Army come from the people, their food and clothing come from the people, and the wounded are treated among the people. In combat, the people brave gunfire to send intelligence, water, and food to the army, rescue the wounded, and bury the martyrs. The army also takes good care of the people. They often rush into the fire to rescue the people or cover the people's transfer during enemy sweeps; during farming and harvesting, they armed to cover the people's rush to plant and harvest, or work with the people. The army and the people truly share weal and woe, fight together, rejoice together, persist in the struggle together, and welcome the final victory together.
    "The long-term war of national liberation and the lofty desire to strive for national independence have armed the Algerian people. For this sacred cause, the Algerian people regard death as home and do not spare their lives." When one person falls, more people stand up, wipe off the blood on their bodies, and continue the struggle. Commander Omar Oussedik and Major Azzedine portrayed many heroic images of the Algerian people's loyalty and unyieldingness to us with proud feelings.
      "On September 28, 1958, when De Gaulle was plotting the so-called "integration" and "referendum" and other scams in an attempt to legalize the conspiracy to annex Algeria, the French colonial troops forced people to hold a "referendum" with guns and bayonets. At an election conference in a certain place, an unknown worker jumped on the table, exposed the enemy's despicable trick, and called on the people to resist this forced election against their will. The French colonial army shot him, and blood flowed down the table legs into the land of the Algerian heroes. He looked at the whole audience affectionately, said his final farewell to his dear compatriots, and said passionately: "I know I won't survive, but the National Liberation Army will definitely avenge us!" "Long live independent Algeria!" Blood gushed from his wound, and he fell. But more people stood up. They fought with stones against the French army on the spot....
      "In June 1958, an eighteen-year-old girl, Fatima, boarded a speeding train with a time bomb. She aroused the attention of the train guard. The train guard wanted to search her, but she sternly refused. She was taken to the Oranville City Police Station, and secretly set the time for the bomb to explode at eleven o'clock inside her dress. There was only one minute left until eleven o'clock. She fearlessly rushed into the police chief's office. Four French police officers and policemen were killed. The heroine also fell in a burst of explosions....
      "In a certain French military restricted area in northern Algeria, the sixteen-year-old girl Zou Na had been hiding in the caves in the residents' homes for a long time, often leading the people at night to climb over the enemy's heavy blockades and barbed wire, carrying the ammunition and grain from the underground warehouses and sending them to the National Liberation Army in the mountains. Once, she was unfortunately arrested. The enemy used needles to stab her ten fingers, and burned her lower body with fire, forcing her to confess the location of the National Liberation Army. But she endured the inhuman pain loyally, and didn't say a word. The exasperated enemy frantically stabbed her body with sharp knives and cut off her breasts.... However, the beasts could never conquer the girl's loyalty to the motherland. The girl fell. The heroic roar of "Long live the victory of the Algerian people" at the time of execution will forever remain in the hearts of the Algerian people."
    As our visit was about to end, the distinguished guests repeatedly expressed to us that the fighting Algerian people sincerely thank the great Chinese people for their concern, sympathy, and support for their sacred struggle. They hoped that we could convey their sincere respect to the 650 million Chinese people.
    The distinguished guests pointed out that the current international situation is very favorable to the Algerian people's struggle. The French invading army not only cannot defeat the Liberation Army, which terrifies them, more and more every day, but will eventually be buried by the more than 10 million Algerian people who make them unable to stand. The flames of national independence and liberation have spread throughout Algeria and are burning more and more vigorously. It is like a prairie fire caused by a careless shepherd who left a fire on the dry grassland, which will eventually burn all French invading troops and colonial forces clean.
    That's right, heroic Algerian comrades! A spark can start a prairie fire, continue to hold high the battle flag of national independence and liberation and bravely move forward! The dawn of final victory has already risen on the unyielding Algerian land. The banner of national independence and freedom will surely be planted all over the fighting and heroic Algeria in the near future! (Attached picture)

    战旗飘飘
    ——阿尔及利亚军事代表团访问记
    本报记者　周泽民　丁固
    一个春雨稀洒的下午，我们怀着最大的敬意访问了应我国国防部长彭德怀元帅邀请，前来我国进行友好访问的阿尔及利亚民族解放军的代表——阿尔及利亚军事代表团。
    奥马尔·乌西迪克团长等在会客室里接待了我们。这位不久前才离开战火纷飞的阿尔及利亚前线的指挥官，以充满胜利信心的语调和手势，向我们介绍了阿尔及利亚民族解放运动如燎原烈火乘胜前进的胜利形势，以及英勇的阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放军艰苦奋战、顽强打击敌人的壮丽情景：从边疆到边疆，从高山到沙漠，阿尔及利亚到处战旗飘飘。英雄的人民正坚持战斗，顽强地向最后胜利阔步挺进。
      “今天，阿尔及利亚全民都在对法国殖民军队作战。从北到南，民族解放军几乎已控制了全国。战线正在由广大的农村和山区逐渐地向城镇和交通线推移。现在，我们全国军民斗志旺盛，正在全力夺取最后胜利；而敌人则日暮途穷，伤亡损失越来越惨重，面临最后失败的前夕。”奥马尔·乌西迪克团长兴奋地告诉我们，这就是目前阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的形势特点。
    奥马尔·乌西迪克团长说：
      “这个形势是由1958年开始的。1959年，更有了显著的发展。现在，我们不但在全国范围内进行了有效的政治控制，民族解放军组织遍及全国，根据地和游击区不断扩大，甚至在一些大城市里也生长了游击队。这就使得法国侵略部队和殖民部队日夜不安。他们每天都要受到袭击，付出很大的伤亡和损失。据法国内部材料透露，敌人用在侵略阿尔及利亚的战费，最高一天达四十亿法郎。这个数字，相当于法国过去在印度支那战争中最高一天消耗战费二十亿法郎的一倍。这还不包括侵略军人员的伤亡和重型装备以及军事设施的损失。去年底，阿尔及利亚民族解放军一举突破长三百多公里宽半公里的法国殖民军一度吹嘘为‘不可突破的防线’的摩里斯防线这一事实，就有力地标志着我军战斗威力的增强和敌军土崩瓦解的开始。”
      “当然，阿尔及利亚人民的胜利不是轻易取得的。斗争是艰巨的。帝国主义越到垂死越疯狂。法国殖民者对阿尔及利亚人民的镇压是非常残酷的。他们已经到了绝灭人性的地步。他们一方面以六十万现代化武装和二十万警察部队日日夜夜在阿尔及利亚进行疯狂的大屠杀和大破坏，同时，还在阿尔及利亚遍设‘死亡营’和监狱，血腥迫害各阶层人民。他们烧杀抢掠，奸淫妇女，轰炸村庄，制造‘死亡的无人地带’烧毁森林、果园和庄稼，无恶不作。他们禁止农民种地，把大量的阿尔及利亚人民抛上饥饿线。过去四年多，他们杀害阿尔及利亚男女老幼达八十万人，把十五万爱国志士投进了监狱，一百五十万阿尔及利亚人关进了死亡营。为了消灭阿尔及利亚民族，侵略者强拉阿尔及利亚男女青年施行绝育手术，并且对一至四岁的小孩注射‘死亡针’。在阿尔及利亚南部的两个村庄中，八十八个小孩头天注射，第二天就全部被死亡从母亲的怀抱中夺走了……。”
    奥马尔·乌西迪克团长怀着对受难人民的深沉悼念，声调逐渐低沉下来。窗外天色阴霾，细雨霏霏。我们也怀着对英雄人民的无比崇敬和同情，眼眶润湿了。
    突然，奥马尔·乌西迪克团长从沙发上站了起来，异常激奋地挥动拳头大声说，但是，阿尔及利亚人民是不屈的。他们每天都在用子弹和炸弹回击侵略者。从突尼斯边境到摩洛哥边境，从北部的大卡比利到南部的边疆，处处燃起了反抗侵略、争取独立的烈火，人人都是打击法国侵略军的勇士。
    接着，奥马尔·乌西迪克团长以自豪的感情向我们介绍了阿尔及利亚民族解放军和民兵、游击队以及人民的英勇战斗事迹。
    奥马尔·乌西迪克团长首先向我们介绍了代表团团员、阿尔及利亚第四战区司令阿泽丁少校的动人事迹。一天以后，我们又会见了这位阿尔及利亚全国闻名的英雄。
    这是一位钢铁工人出身的青年军官，今年才二十五岁。面色略显黄瘦，但眉宇间英气勃勃。他的身上负了十三次伤，至今还有三发美国造的子弹深埋在后腰。他两次因伤被俘，但他始终坚贞不屈，一刻也没有停止过战斗。1955年10月10日，他曾带领十一名战士突入敌占区开辟根据地。一举拔除了敌军的一个碉堡，歼灭法军二十名。1956年7月14日，他在医院治疗战伤时，遇到了敌军大扫荡。医院被包围了。他用两个手榴弹炸死了两个法军，终因右腿伤重无法跑脱，腿部又连中三枪，昏迷中被法军俘掳。他被关进塔卜拉特法军监狱度过了三个月。伤口痊愈后，他在狱中组织了暴动和十几位同狱难友一起，用木棍打死一名警卫、俘掳三名警卫，冲出了监狱。法军随后追来。他们逃进一个正在赶集的小集镇，当人民发现他们是民族解放军的战士时，马上脱下自己的衣服，换去了他们的囚衣。牧羊人把一群羊交给他们让他们伪装做牧羊人赶羊出镇。大批的市民立即向和他们相反的方向奔逃，引诱法军向大量人流的地方追击。他们从容地逃离险境，回到了部队。
    1957年8月4日在阿尔及尔以南七十多公里的乌勒德图瓦提地区，他带领敢死队员一百一十一人对敌占村庄展开了袭击。任务完成后去布泽扎集中时，遭到了马絮、阿兰德、西蒙等三个法国将领指挥的一万五千名法军的包围。敌人派遣了美制B25、B26、B29等各种飞机对他们进行了疯狂的轰炸。接着，法军就发动了全面的进攻。阿泽丁指挥全体敢死队员从高山上打退了敌军的冲锋，并且奋勇冲入敌军阵地，在敌军腹心阵地横冲直撞打了一天。打得敌人马仰人翻，一片混乱。天黑，他们突出了重围，缴获了大量的枪枝和弹药，还抓了三十四个俘虏。这次战斗，给这个位于大城市阿尔及尔边上的敌占区人民带来巨大鼓舞。他们说：“一个钢铁工人（指阿泽丁）能打败三个法国将军，我们一定能胜利”。阿泽丁少校说：“敌人可以用飞机毁平我们的村庄，用坦克碾平我们的城市，可以杀死我，但他们永远也无法使我们放下武器。阿尔及利亚一天不解放，我们就不停止战斗。”
    农民出身的阿尔及利亚撒哈拉区司令斯利曼少校也向我们介绍了民族解放军在撒哈拉大沙漠突袭敌军掠夺阿尔及利亚石油的英勇斗争故事。
      “法国殖民主义者想用军事力量保证石油从阿尔及利亚源源运出是完全不可能。”斯利曼少校说，一次，我们四十个青年组成的小部队，经过三天三夜急行军，插入到撒哈拉大沙漠的中心地区，给敌人一个突然袭击。尽管这里的石油矿厂区有法军一个加强师，并有飞机在空中巡逻，但是这个地区的输油管和矿厂里的机器仍然大部分被我们炸毁了。防守的法国军队被我军杀伤了数百人。七名法国军官作了我们的俘掳。当敌人调来大批兵力企图报复时，这支坚强的小部队已经化整为零，配合当地武装部队又在另一条运输线上炸毁了法国军队的石油列车。
    斯利曼少校说，这样事件，在阿尔及利亚几乎天天都有发生。法国军事当局为了保护数百公里长的石油运输线，在这个地区，整整集中了七十个法国正规师，空军部队和直升飞机。法军在铁路线两旁修建了上千座的堡垒，布置了地雷阵地和铁丝网，此外还有摩托化巡逻队日夜巡逻。但是这一切丝毫也阻挡不了阿尔及利亚人民的活动。仅从去年7月1日到12月底的半年中，阿尔及利亚民族解放军就袭击石油列车五十二次，炸毁满载石油的列车四十八列，并且破坏了具有很重大军事价值的铁路设备和水塔共十二处，打死打伤法军三千五百多人。斯利曼少校说：“法国的将军也不得不承认，我军对石油运输线的一再袭击，已使他们感到特别可怕。”
      “我们力量和胜利的源泉来自人民。”奥马尔·乌西迪克团长和阿泽丁少校在谈到取得胜利的原因时都一再强调地指出战斗的阿尔及利亚军民一致共同斗争的优良传统。他们说，在阿尔及利亚，军队生活在人民当中。人民对于军队的热爱和支援是无微不至的。解放军官兵来自人民，衣食来自人民，伤员在人民中治疗。作战时，人民冒着枪林弹雨为军队送情报、送水、送饭，抢救伤员，掩埋烈士。军队对于人民也十分爱护。他们常常在敌人扫荡时，冲进火海抢救人民或掩护人民转移；在耕种收获时，武装掩护人民抢种抢收，或和人民一起劳动。军队和人民，真正地是同甘苦，共患难，共同战斗，共同欢乐，共同坚持斗争，迎接最后的胜利。
    “长期的祖国解放战争，争取民族独立的崇高愿望武装了阿尔及利亚人。为了这个神圣事业，阿尔及利亚人视死如归，毫不吝惜自己的生命”。一个人倒下去，更多的人站了起来，揩干身上的血迹，继续斗争。奥马尔·乌西迪克团长和阿泽丁少校以骄傲的感情，向我们描绘了许多阿尔及利亚人民坚贞不屈的英雄形象。
      “1958年9月28日，在戴高乐策划所谓“整体化”和“公民投票”等骗局，企图使吞并阿尔及利亚合法化的阴谋正在实施的时候，法国殖民部队用枪弹和刺刀强迫人们举行“公民投票”。在某地选举大会上，一位不知名的工人跳上了桌子，揭穿敌人的卑鄙勾当，号召人民抗拒这种违反自己意志的强迫选举。法国殖民军队向他开枪了，鲜血顺着桌腿浸入阿尔及利亚英雄的土地。他深情地眼望着全场，向亲爱的同胞最后告别，并且激昂地说：“我知道我是活不了了，但是民族解放军一定要给我们报仇的！”“独立的阿尔及利亚万岁！”鲜血泊泊地涌出他的伤口，他倒下了。但更多的人站了起来。他们当场用石头和法军展开了战斗……。
      “1958年6月，一位十八岁的女青年法蒂马带着一枚定时炸弹，乘上奔驰的列车。她引起了车警的注意。车警要搜查她，被她严词拒绝了。她被带到奥兰维尔城警察所，并偷偷地在怀内把炸弹爆炸的时间定在十一时。离十一时只有一分钟了，她英勇无畏地冲进了警察所长办公室。炸死了四名法国警官和警察。女英雄也在一阵爆炸声中倒了下去……。
      “在阿尔及利亚北部某法军禁区，十六岁的左娜姑娘长期隐藏在居民家中的地洞里，经常在夜间领导人民爬过敌人的重重封锁线和铁丝网，把地下仓库的弹药和粮食背出去，送给山区的民族解放军。有一次，她不幸被捕了。敌人用针刺她的十个手指，用火烧她的下身，逼她供出民族解放军的驻地。但她坚贞地忍着非人能忍受的疼痛，一字不吐。恼羞成怒的敌人疯狂地用尖刀乱戳她的身躯，割下她的乳房……。但是，野兽们永远无法征服姑娘忠于祖国的赤胆丹心。姑娘倒下去了。临刑时‘阿尔及利亚人民胜利万岁’的英雄吼声，永远留在阿尔及利亚人民的心中。”
    当我们的访问将要结束时，贵宾们一再向我们表示，战斗的阿尔及利亚人民衷心感谢伟大的中国人民对他们神圣斗争的关怀、同情和支持。希望我们能把他们这种真诚的敬意转达给六亿五千万中国人民。
    宾贵们指出，目前的国际局势对于阿尔及利亚人民的斗争是十分有利的。法国侵略军不但一天比一天更加无法战胜叫他们丧胆的解放军，而且终究必然被使他们站不住脚的一千多万阿尔及利亚人民所埋葬。民族独立和解放的烈火已经燃遍整个阿尔及利亚，并且越烧越旺。它就像一个不小心的牧人在干枯的草原上遗下的火种造成的燎原大火，终将把一切法国侵略军队和殖民势力烧毁得干干净净。
    说的对，英雄的阿尔及利亚战友！星火可以燎原，继续高举民族独立解放的战旗奋勇前进吧！最后胜利的曙光已经在不屈的阿尔及利亚大地上升起。民族独立、自由的旗帜，一定在不久的将来插遍战斗的英雄的阿尔及利亚！（附图片）
