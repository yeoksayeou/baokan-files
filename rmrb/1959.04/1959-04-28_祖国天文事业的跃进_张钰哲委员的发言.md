In Premier Zhou's government work report, I recognized the great achievements during the First Five-Year Plan, the unprecedented leap forward in the national economy in 1958, and the even more magnificent targets and plans for socialist construction in 1959. These achievements prove the correctness of the general line's guidance, with the production of steel, coal, grain, and cotton as the main tasks, and the policy of "marshals leading the way." The report also mentioned that "in science and technology...the task of directly serving production and construction should be given primary importance... Basic theoretical research has a profound impact on the development of science and technology and must be given sufficient attention." Astronomy work falls into the category of basic theoretical research. In the midst of the vigorous advance and the nationwide leap forward, we astronomical workers did not dare to neglect our responsibilities and made certain achievements in completing the long-term plan for scientific development.

The discipline of astronomy includes departments that can directly serve economic construction. The accurate time signals broadcasted daily by the Xujiahui Observatory directly serve geodesy, cartography, and other units that use accurate time. When we took over this observatory from the French Catholics in the early days of Shanghai's liberation, it only had outdated equipment from thirty or fifty years ago, and it only broadcasted low-quality time signals twice a day. With the attention and support of the Party and the government, we equipped the time broadcasting work here with more than ten sets of the latest astronomical pendulum clocks and quartz clocks, as well as a complete set of new time measurement and reception equipment. The number of broadcasts per day has increased to as many as seven times. The accuracy of the transmitted time signals has been improved to 0.002 or 0.003 seconds, which fully meets the strict requirements of China's geodetic surveying work.

Promulgating the calendar has been the main task of astronomers in our country since ancient times. Now this traditional task is undertaken by the Zijinshan Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing. We complete the calculation and compilation of three kinds of almanacs every year, namely, the astronomical almanac, the nautical almanac, and the aeronautical almanac, to meet the needs of astronomical measurement, aviation, and navigation.

The sun is the source of light, heat, and all other energy on the earth. It is also the closest representative of the countless stars in the sky. Naturally, we should treat it differently and give it special attention. Zijinshan Observatory, Beijing Observatory, Sheshan Observatory, Qingdao Observatory, and Kunming Observatory, everyone works together to observe sunspots and other phenomena on the surface of the sun. In this way, we can avoid days when solar observations are interrupted, because the chance of these many places being cloudy at the same time is not high. Several of the observatories are equipped with special solar telescopes, which can film the flame-like solar prominences and flares, which can only be seen during total solar eclipses and disrupt telecommunications and geomagnetic conditions. The goal of this work is to master the patterns of flare occurrence in order to forecast the time when radio waves will be interfered with and to give warnings to telecommunications departments. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to combine long-term meticulous observation with research on the theory of the internal structure of the sun. This approach also embodies the spirit of task-driven disciplines in scientific research.

In addition to directly serving economic construction, astronomical work also serves cultural construction. It has the task of understanding the universe and recognizing nature. Therefore, we have also carried out observations of stellar physics and research on the evolution of celestial bodies. In the course of our work, we have discovered some asteroids and calculated their orbits. There are three main cooperative projects in astronomical work with the Soviet Union. The first is to participate in the Soviet Union's compilation of faint star catalogs. The Sheshan Observatory conducts long-term photographic observations of stars, asteroids, and extragalactic nebulae. The second is to observe the artificial earth satellites launched by the Soviet Union. We have organized twenty or thirty observation stations across the country and telegraph the results of our observations to the Soviet Union at any time, which are important basic data for their research on the movement of artificial satellites and forecasting the location of satellites. The third is to participate in the study of the movement of the North Pole on the ground. We have established a latitude station in Tianjin to conduct regular and precise latitude measurements.

After World War II, a new discipline emerged, called radio astronomy. It uses radio telescopes to receive radio waves emitted from celestial bodies, just as ordinary telescopes can receive light waves from celestial bodies. However, there is a lot of dust and fog in outer space. Light from distant stars will be absorbed by this dust and fog. Ordinary telescopes cannot see them. However, radio waves can pass through unimpeded. Therefore, the cosmic space that radio telescopes can observe is much larger than optical telescopes. In 1958, the Soviet Union sent a large scientific team with about ten radio telescopes to Hainan Island, China, to observe the annular solar eclipse on April 19. Chinese scientists also participated in this work. In this context, the Soviet Union helped us establish the foundation for radio astronomy work and trained cadres in this area. Now both Beijing and Nanjing are starting radio astronomy work. Looking back at the end of World War II, most of the technicians engaged in radio astronomy abroad were transferred from radar work. The simple radio telescopes initially used were mostly converted from radar. From this, we realized how close the connection is between radio astronomy and national defense work.

The capitals of major countries in the world have astronomical observatories. China's capital, Beijing, has very favorable meteorological conditions. There are an average of more than two hundred clear days every year, so a large astronomical observatory should be established. In 1956, the Soviet Union sent some leading astronomers to help us with the plan for the development of astronomy. They also advocated that a comprehensive astronomical observatory should be established in Beijing. The observatory should be equipped with a series of astronomical telescopes with a diameter of up to two meters. Coincidentally, we have an astronomer who studied in France for more than 30 years, and has also made outstanding achievements and positions in astronomical research. Seeing the grand plan of the motherland to develop science, in the autumn of 1957, he resolutely returned to the motherland, from which he had been separated for more than 30 years, to serve the people and undertake the arduous and glorious task of preparing for the establishment of the Beijing Observatory. At present, three highlands above 1,000 meters above sea level have been preliminarily selected as candidate sites for the observatory in the area within 100 kilometers northwest of Beijing. After another period of star observation this year, the final decision will be made. It is expected that the basic construction of the observatory will begin next year. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, some telescopes ranging from 60 cm to 2 meters in diameter can be installed and start observation work.

The completion of the Beijing Observatory will become the largest astronomical observatory in China at this stage. It will mark a milestone in the progress of China's astronomical undertakings. However, the instruments equipped in observatories around the world already have telescopes with a diameter of up to five meters. More observatories should be established on our vast land to catch up with the level of scientifically advanced countries. Our Kunming and Lhasa are suitable for carrying out solar observation work. Because the altitude is high and the air is thin, the light absorbed by the sun is relatively less. In Kunming and Lhasa, astronomers do not have to be far away from the city to reach an altitude of 2,000 meters to 3,600 meters, which can greatly reduce the difficulties in life. The latitude in southern China is lower than 20 degrees, so most of the stars south of the equator can be observed. Establishing a large astronomical observatory here is of great significance in international cooperation, because it can provide the observation data of the southern sky that socialist countries need. Our country should also have more time measurement stations and latitude stations. Therefore, in the plan to develop the astronomical undertakings of the motherland, there is still a lot of work waiting for us to complete.

We recognize that the great development of astronomical undertakings must be equipped with a large number of astronomical instruments. We have already begun to train cadres to grind glass mirrors. We are organizing technical forces to try to manufacture the large telescopes needed by the Beijing Observatory, laying the foundation for the future development of the telescope manufacturing industry. At the same time, we are preparing to build an astronomical instrument factory in Nanjing. The development of astronomical undertakings also requires a large number of cadres with high training in basic disciplines to take on the work. At present, only Nanjing University has an astronomy major. It can have two or thirty graduates enter astronomical work posts every year. We hope that after the establishment of the Beijing Observatory, Peking University will also open an astronomy major to train astronomical cadres with various specialties to adapt to the needs of the increasingly diverse astronomical work.

In today's era of continuous launching of artificial satellites and space rockets, everyone is paying more attention to the discipline of astronomy. With the attention of the Party and the government and the support of the vigorously developing various scientific and technological fields, China's astronomical undertakings are determined to leap forward together with other undertakings. I am taking this opportunity to report to you on the current situation of Chinese astronomical work and the scale of recent development, and I hope that the committee members will give criticisms and guidance.

    祖国天文事业的跃进
    张钰哲委员的发言
    我从周总理的政府工作报告中，认识到第一个五年计划时期内的伟大成就，一九五八年史无前例的国民经济的大跃进和一九五九年社会主义建设更加宏伟的指标和计划。这个成就证明了总路线指导下以钢煤粮棉四大指标的生产为主要任务，和元帅先行这些政策的正确性。这个报告也提到了“在科学技术上……直接为生产建设服务的任务，应当放在首要的地位。……基础理论的研究，对于科学技术的发展具有深远的影响，必须给以足够的重视。”天文工作，算是属于基础理论研究的范畴。在万马奔腾、全民大跃进当中，我们天文工作者，并没敢忽视了自己的职责，在完成科学发展远景规划上，曾经作出了一定的成绩。
    天文学科包含有能够直接为经济建设服务的部门。徐家汇观象台每天所发播的准确时刻的讯号，就是直接为大地测量制图以及其他使用准确时刻的单位服务。当上海解放初期，我们把这个观象台从法国天主教徒手里接管过来的时候，其中只有三、五十年前陈旧的设备，而且每天仅发播两次质量不高的时号。在党和政府的重视和支持下，我们为这里的播时工作，配备了十多具最新式的天文摆钟和石英钟以及整套的测时收时新设备。播时次数每天增加到七次之多。发出时号的准确度，提高到千分之二、三秒。完全满足了我国大地测量工作方面严格的要求。
    颁布历法是我国自古以来天文家的主要工作。现在这项传统的任务，是由中国科学院的南京紫金山天文台担负起来。我们每年要完成天文年历、航海历和航空历三种历书的编算工作，以满足天文测量航空航海各方面的需要。
    太阳是地球上的光热和其他一切能量的来源。它也是天空里无数恒星中和我们最接近的一个代表。很自然地我们对它要另眼相待，给以特殊的重视。紫金山天文台、北京天文台、佘山观象台、青岛观象台、昆明天文台，大家共同来观测太阳表面的黑子和其他现象。这样子就可避免太阳观测有了间断的日子，因为这许多地方同时都是阴天的机会是不多的。其中几个台站配备有特殊的太阳望远镜，它能够把从前只在日全食时才能看到的火焰一般的日珥爆发，和会扰乱电讯传播和地磁情况的耀斑现象，拍成电影。这项工作的目标，是要掌握耀斑出现的规律，来预报无线电波将被干扰的时刻，给电讯部门以警告。要达到这个目的，必需由长期细致的观测和太阳内部构造理论的研究相结合。这种的作法，同时体现了科学研究工作当中以任务带动学科的精神。
    天文工作在直接为经济建设服务之外，还有为文化建设服务的一方面。它负有了解宇宙认识自然的任务。所以我们也进行了恒星物理的观测，和天体演化的研究。在工作当中曾经发现了一些小行星并且推算出来它们的轨道。天文工作中同苏联合作的项目，主要的有三种。一是为了参加苏联编制微星星表的工作，佘山观象台进行长期的恒星小行星和河外星云的照像观测。二是为了观测苏联所发射的人造地球卫星，我们在全国范围内组织了二三十处的观测站，随时把观测所得的结果，电告苏联，以作他们研究人造卫星运动和预报卫星方位的重要基本数据。三是为了参加研究地面上北极移动的情况，我们在天津建立了纬度站，进行经常性的精密纬度的测定。
    第二次世界大战之后，新兴起了一门学科，叫作射电天文。它利用了射电望远镜，来接收从天体所发射出来的无线电波，也就如同普通的望远镜能够接收从天体射来的光波一样。不过宇宙空间，存在着不少的尘雾。从遥远星体射来的光线会被这种尘雾所吸收。普通的望远镜看不见它们。但是无线电波，可以通行无阻。所以射电望远镜，所能观察到的宇宙空间，大大超过了光学的望远镜。苏联于一九五八年派遣了很大的科学队伍，携带了十架左右的射电望远镜，到我国海南岛，进行观测四月十九日的日环食。我国的科学家，也参加了这项工作。就在这种情况下，苏联帮助了我们建立射电天文工作的基础，培养了这一方面的干部。现在北京和南京两方面都正在开始射电天文的工作。回顾第二次世界大战结束之后，国外从事射电天文的技术人员，多半是由雷达工作方面转业过来。最初所用的简陋射电望远镜，也多是用雷达改装。从此我们体会到射电天文和国防工作之间，是有多么密切的联系。
    世界上各大国的首都所在地，都建立有天文台。我国的首都北京有非常优越的气象条件。每年平均有二百多的晴天，所以更应该建立起宏大的天文台。一九五六年苏联派来一些具有领导地位的天文学者，来帮助我们作发展天文的计划。他们也都主张应当在北京建立一个综合性的天文台。台上应当配备直径大到两公尺的一系列的天文望远镜。恰巧我们有一位天文学者，在法国留学了三十多年，在天文研究上，也有了卓越的成就和地位。他看到祖国发展科学的宏伟计划，于一九五七年的秋天，毅然决然回到阔别三十多年的祖国，为人民服务，承担起筹建北京天文台这件艰巨而光荣的任务。目前正在北京西北方一百公里以内的地区，初步选定了海拔一千公尺以上的高地三处作天文台址的候选地。今年内再进行一个时期星象观测之后，便可作出最后决定。预计明年开始进行天文台的基本建设。在第二个五年计划期内，从直径六十公分到两公尺的一些望远镜，都可以安装完毕，开始进行观测的工作。
    北京天文台的完成，将成为我国现阶段最大的天文台。它将标志着我国天文事业进展的一个里程碑。不过世界上天文台所配备的仪器，已有直径达到五公尺的望远镜。在我们幅员辽阔的土地上，应当建立起更多的天文台，才能赶上科学先进国家的水平。我们的昆明拉萨这些地方适宜于开展太阳的观测工作。因为海拔高了，空气稀薄，太阳被吸收去的光线也就比较少。在昆明拉萨，天文工作者，不必远离城市，便达到两千公尺到三千六百公尺的海拔，可以大为减少生活上的困难。我国南部纬度低于二十度，可以观测到绝大部分赤道以南的星斗。在这里建立大型的天文台，在国际合作上，有很大的意义，因为它能够供给社会主义国家所需要的南天星象的观测数据。我们国家也应该有更多的测时站和纬度站。所以在发展祖国天文事业的计划中，尚有很多的工作，等待着我们去完成。
    我们认识到天文事业的大发展，必需配备有大量的天文仪器。我们已经开始培养磨制玻璃镜面的干部。正在组织技术力量，来试制北京台所需要的大型望远镜，为以后开展望远镜的制造工业奠定基础。我们同时在南京开始筹建了一个天文仪器厂。天文事业的发展，也需要有受过基础学科高度训练的大批干部来担任工作。现在国内只是南京大学有天文专业。它每年可以有二三十名的毕业生走上天文工作岗位。我们希望在北京天文台成立之后，北京大学也开办天文专业来培养具有各种专长的天文干部，以适应日益发展多种多样天文工作的需要。
    在人造卫星宇宙火箭不断发射的今天，大家对于天文学科，都更加注意。在党和政府的重视和蓬勃发展的各门科学技术的支援下，我国的天文事业决定会同其他事业一起跃进。我借着这次发言的机会向大家汇报了中国天文工作的现况和最近发展的规模，希委员们给以批评指教。
