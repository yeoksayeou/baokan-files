Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 6th. According to incomplete statistics up to the 4th, the Lhasa Military Control Commission has arranged jobs for more than 400 unemployed people in Lhasa and distributed relief grain to more than 1,000 impoverished citizens.

The armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique caused serious losses to the citizens of Lhasa and made the lives of many citizens even more difficult. After the establishment of the Municipal Military Control Commission, it took measures to introduce jobs to the unemployed. In the past few days, many of those who registered for employment at the work teams of the Military Control Commission have happily participated in construction work such as road building or agricultural labor, and some are waiting to be assigned work. The work teams of the Military Control Commission also distributed highland barley and tsampa to impoverished citizens whose lives were almost desperate due to the rebellion of the reactionary clique. Among those who received relief were old women in their nineties, one-year-old orphans whose parents were killed by the rebels, and farmers and herdsmen from other places who came to Lhasa to provide labor service and deliver grain to the nobles but could not return home because of the rebellion. The four sisters, Tsering Yangjom, whose parents were taken away by the rebels, burst into tears of gratitude after receiving the relief grain. She said emotionally, "If it were not for the relief from the Military Control Commission, the children would not be able to survive. I will never forget the kindness of the Communist Party. In the future, I must let the children know that it was the rebels who harmed their relatives, and it was the Communist Party who saved them and raised them." After receiving the tsampa, 66-year-old Pema said to the people receiving relief grain, "Those reactionary elements usually don't care about the life or death of the people at all, and they launched a rebellion without humanity, making our lives even more difficult." When the cadres of the Military Control Commission delivered the relief grain to the home of Lhamo Tsering, a lonely old woman, the old woman burst into tears. Her neighbors were also deeply moved. They said: The Communist Party takes care of the common people like this, they are really the benefactors of the common people, and the real enemies of the people are those reactionary upper classes and rebels.

    给遭受叛国集团祸害的僧俗人民安排新的生活
    拉萨军管会救济受难市民
    新华社拉萨6日电　据到4日止的不完全统计，拉萨市军事管制委员会已经为拉萨市的四百多名失业者安排了工作，并且给一千多名贫苦市民发放了救济粮。
    西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱，给拉萨市民造成了严重的损失，使许多市民的生活更加困难。市军事管制委员会成立后，就采取措施为失业者介绍工作。几天来，在军管会各工作队登记就业的人，有不少已愉快地参加了筑路等建设工作或农业劳动，有的正在等待分配工作。军管会的各工作队还对由于反动集团的叛乱而生活几乎陷于绝境的贫苦市民发放了青稞和糌粑。得到救济的人中，有九十多岁的老妇，有父母被叛乱分子杀害的一周岁的孤儿，还有来拉萨给贵族支差送粮，因为叛乱而不能回家的外乡农牧民等。父母被叛乱分子夺走的茨仁央珠姊妹四人，领到救济粮后，她们的姨祖母感激得眼泪横流，她激动地说：“要不是军管会的救济，孩子们是无法活下去了，我永远忘不了共产党的恩情。将来一定要让孩子们知道是叛乱分子害了她们的亲人，是共产党把她们救活养大的。”六十六岁的白玛领到糌粑后对领救济粮的人说：“那些反动分子平时根本不顾人民的死活，还毫无人性地发动叛乱，使我们的生活更加困难。”当军管会的干部把救济粮送到一个孤苦无靠的老妇人拉姆次仁家里时，这个老妇人激动地流下了眼泪。她的左邻右舍也都深受感动，他们说：共产党这样照顾老百姓，才真是老百姓的恩人，人民真正的敌人是那些反动上层和叛乱分子。
