The more you do, the more thorough it becomes

　　Educational work is ideological work. Any ideological work needs to be done more and more thoroughly, and school education is no exception. Since 1958, in the process of implementing the Party's educational policy, school education has achieved great results. On this basis, to consolidate and develop the existing achievements, we naturally need to carry out ideological work more carefully and deeply. As an ancient Chinese saying goes, "For a year's plan, there is nothing better than planting grain; for a ten-year plan, there is nothing better than planting trees; for a lifelong plan, there is nothing better than cultivating people" (Guanzi). Socialist school education aims to cultivate new people who are cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. The magnitude of the responsibility, the weight of the work, and the complexity of the tasks are very obvious. How can we engage in it simply?
　　In the educational work of universities, how should teaching plans be revised? How should teaching syllabuses be compiled? How should teaching content be enriched? How should teaching methods be improved? How should scientific research be enhanced? How should productive labor be arranged? etc. The solution of these problems requires hard work, active engagement, and striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results.
　　Construction workers need a blueprint before building a house; sculptors need a base before carving ivory; teaching work also needs a plan first. In universities, each department, each major, each teaching and research group, and each grade have their own new things emerging through the practice of combining education with productive labor. They all have their own characteristics and their own laws, and at the same time, they have common laws. Schools should summarize them in a timely manner to recognize and master these laws more quickly, help new things grow, and at the same time, promote past advantages. Many universities are further revising their teaching plans and teaching syllabuses. Some teaching and research groups at Tongji University, in merging and revising new teaching plans and syllabuses, have carried forward the advantages of the original courses and removed the redundant parts, achieving a balance of assimilation. Some departments have further discussed the specific requirements of each production labor, comprehensively considering the arrangement of various courses and teaching links. Tsinghua University requires that in the further revision of teaching plans, the proportion and coordination of various courses should be studied, the changes in various teaching links after combining with productive labor should be summarized, and further adjustments should be made in order to better implement the Party's educational policy and achieve the training goals. These practices will make teaching work better and better.
　　Improving teaching work is a matter for teachers, but it is also a matter for everyone. Teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, teaching methods, etc., must be formulated and implemented by teachers. However, the objects of teaching are students, and students can express their opinions on teaching from their own feelings, especially senior students, who may have more opinions. Therefore, teachers should go deep into classes to listen to students' opinions. Graduates, in their actual work, have tested the knowledge they have learned in the past, and they will also have practical opinions. In order to teach well and learn well, and truly cultivate talents who meet the needs of socialist construction, schools should listen to the opinions of business departments and graduates. If this is done, teaching work will become more and more in-depth, the roots will be deep, the foundation will be firm, and the flowers will bloom beautifully.

    越作越深入
  　学先
    教育工作是思想工作。任何思想工作都需要越作越深入，学校教育工作自然不能例外。1958年以来在贯彻党的教育方针过程中，学校教育取得了很大成绩，在这个基础上去巩固和发展已有的成果，自然需要更加细致更加深入地进行思想工作。我国古话说，“一年之计，莫如树谷；十年之计，莫如树木；终身之计，莫如树人”（管子）。社会主义的学校教育就要树有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者这样的新人，责任之大，工作之重，头绪之繁，是十分明显的，怎么能够简单从事呢？
    高等学校的教育工作中教学计划如何修订？教学大纲如何编写？教学内容如何充实？教学方法如何改进？科学研究如何提高？生产劳动如何安排？等等。这些问题的解决，都必须下苦工夫，积极去干，争取多快好省。
    建筑工人要盖房子，先设计个蓝图；雕刻师要刻象牙，先打个底子；教学工作，也要先有个方案。在高等学校里，一个系，一个专业，一个教研组，一个年级，经过教育同生产劳动相结合的实践，都出现了各自的新生事物，都有自己的特点，有自己的规律，同时，它们又有共同的规律。学校就要及时总结，更快地认识和掌握这些规律，帮助新生事物成长，同时发扬过去的优点。许多高等学校正在进一步修订教学计划和教学大纲。同济大学有些教研组在合并和修订新的教学计划和大纲中，发扬了原有课程的优点，去掉了多余的部分，做到兼收并蓄。有的系进一步商讨了每次生产劳动的具体要求，全面综合考虑了各门功课、各个教学环节的安排。清华大学要求在进一步修订教学计划中，研究各门课程的比重和配合，总结结合生产劳动以后各个教学环节的变化，进一步加以调整，以便更好地贯彻党的教育方针，实现培养目标。这些做法，都将使教学工作越做越好。
    改进教学工作，是教师的事情，也是大家的事情。教学计划、教学大纲、教学方法等等，都要通过教师去制订和执行。但是，教学的对象是学生，学生可以从切身感受来对教学发表意见，特别是高年级学生，可能会有更多的意见。所以，教师要深入班级听取学生的意见。毕业生在实际工作中，检验了过去学习到的知识，也会有切实的意见。学校为了教好学好，真正培养出适应社会主义建设需要的人材来，就要去听取业务部门和毕业生的意见。如果这样做，那就会使教学工作一层深入一层，根扎得深，本立得正，花也就开得好。
