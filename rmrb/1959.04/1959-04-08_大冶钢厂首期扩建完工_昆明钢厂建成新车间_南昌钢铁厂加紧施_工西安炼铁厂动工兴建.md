Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th: A new small continuous rolling mill at the Daye Steel Plant has recently been put into production. With this, the first phase of the steel plant's expansion project has been fully completed.

The first phase of the Daye Steel Plant's expansion project includes steelmaking, rolling, and largely corresponding forging, heat treatment, machine repair, and gas station projects. The completion of these projects has greatly increased the steel ingot and steel production capacity and product variety of the Daye Steel Plant.

Xinhua News Agency reported that the second steelmaking workshop of the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant has been fully completed and put into production. The designed capacity of this workshop is 130,000 tons of steel per year. Its completion is of great significance for Yunnan Province to complete its annual steel production task.

This newspaper reports that Jiangxi Province's first modern iron and steel complex, the Nanchang Iron and Steel Plant, is being built at an accelerated pace. After completion, this plant will produce various steel products such as thin plates, medium plates, seamless steel pipes, and high-grade quality steel.

This newspaper reports that Shaanxi Province's largest iron smelting plant—the Xi'an Iron Plant with sixteen small blast furnaces of eight cubic meters each and an annual iron production of 100,000 tons—has recently begun construction. This plant will adopt a blitzkrieg approach to accelerate construction and is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter, with a target of producing 50,000 tons of pig iron in the third and fourth quarters.
