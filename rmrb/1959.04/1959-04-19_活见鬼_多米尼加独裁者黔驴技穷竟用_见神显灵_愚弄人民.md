    Dominican Dictator Resorts to Desperate Measures, Using "Divine Manifestation" to Fool the People
    Xinhua News Agency, April 18th dispatch from Caracas: According to a recent report in the Venezuelan newspaper "Tribuna Popular," the Dominican dictatorial regime is becoming increasingly unstable. The dictator Trujillo, at his wit's end, has claimed to have seen the "Holy Spirit" in an attempt to win the support of religious followers.

    The report stated that the dictator's "divine manifestation" was announced to the public by the "Voice of the Dominican Republic" radio station. The station also commented, "It is not the first time that the Almighty has chosen the head of state as the messenger to guide the people of our beloved nation towards hope, faith, and charity... This hope, faith, and charity must become the creed of all citizens..." The radio station also vividly described that due to the dictator's own "humility," he was unwilling to personally tell people about this event.

    In commenting on this utterly absurd scheme, "Tribuna Popular" pointed out that because the terror tactics adopted by the dictator Trujillo have not been effective, he is attempting to exploit the people's faith to fool them. Trujillo's behavior is a mockery of Christianity and should be condemned by the church authorities. The newspaper sarcastically said that criminals often see divine "manifestations" before their execution. Trujillo's days are numbered, and nothing can save him from being overthrown by the people's uprising.

    多米尼加独裁者黔驴技穷竟用“见神显灵”愚弄人民
    新华社18日讯　加拉加斯消息：据委内瑞拉“人民论坛报”最近报道，由于多米尼加独裁政权日益不稳，独裁者特鲁希略最近竟黔驴技穷地说他见到了“圣灵”，以期骗取教徒们的支持。
    报道说，这个独裁者“见神显灵”的事是“多米尼加之声”电台向公众宣布的。这家电台还加以评论说，“万能之神选中了国家元首作为把我们可爱的祖国的人民导向希望、信仰和慈爱的使者，这还不是第一次。这种希望、信仰和慈爱必须成为全体公民的信条……。”上述电台还绘形绘色地渲染说，由于独裁者本人的“谦逊”，他不愿意亲自把这件事告诉人们。
    “人民论坛报”在评论这种穷极无聊的勾当时指出，由于独裁者特鲁希略所采取的恐怖手段没有收到什么效果，他便企图利用人民的信仰来愚弄人民。特鲁希略的这种行径，是对基督教的嘲弄，应当受到教会当局的谴责。报纸讥讽的说，罪犯们在正法以前是往往会看到神“显灵”的，特鲁希略的日子已屈指可数，没有任何东西能挽救他免在人民的起义前覆灭。
