　　Several Questions on the Rational Allocation and Use of Labor Force
    Liu Dichens
    With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the realization of people's communes in rural areas nationwide, the state of China's social labor force has undergone a profound change: the phenomenon of social unemployment has been fundamentally eliminated, and almost everyone with the ability to work has participated in labor within their capacity. Moreover, both urban and rural areas feel a shortage of labor. In our large country with a population of over 600 million, it is a great thing to feel that labor is insufficient. It proves that China's industrial and agricultural production is developing rapidly. In the face of the facts, the reactionary arguments that China has too many people and that the problems of eating and employment cannot be solved have been completely bankrupted.
    Chairman Mao once said: "Socialism not only liberates the laborers and means of production from the old society, but also liberates the vast natural world that the old society could not utilize. The masses of the people have infinite creativity. They can organize themselves to advance into all places and departments where they can exert their strength, and advance into the depth and breadth of production, to create increasing welfare undertakings for themselves. … Because the scope of production is larger, the departments are more numerous, and the work is more detailed, there is no fear of having strength but no place to use it." Facts prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's assertion.
    The 1959 National Economic Development Plan, centered on the four major production targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, is an even more ambitious leap forward plan than that of 1958. Achieving this plan requires more labor, therefore, unified planning, overall arrangement, using the existing labor force on the key points, combining technical reforms, improving labor productivity, and giving full play to the role of the labor force is a very urgent issue.
    Unified Planning, Overall Arrangement
    To rationally allocate and use the labor force, we must first adopt the principle of unified planning and overall arrangement, that is, implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" in the arrangement of the labor force. The allocation and use of labor force is a fundamental link in developing production. To ensure the "one chessboard" approach of the national economy, it is impossible without the "one chessboard" approach in the allocation and use of the labor force.
    Before the people's commune movement and the overall great leap forward, because there was still a surplus of social labor, the overall arrangement of the social labor force at that time focused on the number of people employed in state-owned enterprises, institutions, and organizations, the training targets for technical workers, and the sources for replenishing employees. This was not only limited by the ownership system at the time, but also adapted to the development of production at the time. The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958 and the realization of people's communes in rural areas nationwide have further provided more favorable conditions for unified planning and overall arrangement of the social labor force.
    The most important methods for overall arrangement and rational use of the labor force are to determine the appropriate proportion of labor force used among the various production departments (agricultural sector, industrial sector, transportation sector) according to the needs of production, to rationally deploy labor force between regular production tasks and rush production tasks, to designate the number of rural labor force to support cities, and to establish reserve work areas or reserve worker systems.
    Proportionately allocating and using the labor force is required for the proportional development of the national economy. This can flexibly adjust and deploy manpower to avoid the phenomenon of having things to do but no one to do them, or having people but no work to do, greatly reducing and eliminating the waste of labor force. The arrangement of the labor force is to serve production; this is one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, the arrangement of production must also fully consider the conditions and possibilities of the labor force, and do everything possible to save the use of labor force. This is the mutual relationship between production and the labor force. Production and the labor force must be planned and arranged simultaneously and comprehensively to maintain a correct proportional relationship between the two, which is conducive to the development of production. In state-owned enterprises, when adding new employees, attention should also be paid to economic accounting, strictly implement quota management, and prevent the phenomenon of excessive increase in personnel at one time. The arrangement of rural labor force not only relates to the overall leap forward in rural production, but also directly relates to the support for large and medium-sized enterprises in cities.
    To rationally allocate and use the labor force, it is also necessary to accurately grasp labor resources, so that all people in society participate in labor within their capacity, and take active measures to maintain a certain balance between labor resources and needs. At present, the labor shortage is indeed a fact, but China's labor resources are still very abundant. This is not only because there are many people and a large labor force, but also because the Chinese people have a fine tradition of diligence. Under the leadership and education of the Party, their political awareness is constantly improving. There is also a series of policies and systems such as the combination of education and productive labor, cadres participating in physical labor, "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," etc. As long as these factors are mobilized and unified planned and comprehensively arranged, greater labor potential can be brought into play and more labor resources can be tapped.
    At the same time, to do a good job in the unified planning and overall arrangement of the labor force, on the one hand, we must, according to the arrangement of production and construction and the need for labor force, distinguish between the primary and secondary, the priority and the sequence, the important and the less important, the urgent and the less urgent, and the partial should be subordinate to the whole, and first ensure the need to complete the four major production targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. On the other hand, we must also vigorously organize the cooperation of the labor force between urban and rural areas, between enterprises, and within enterprises, and mutually adjust and flexibly deploy them.
    Quickly Improve Labor Productivity and Economize on the Use of Labor Force
    There are only two ways for various economic departments to increase production: one is to increase the number of new workers, and the other is to increase labor productivity.
    New enterprises are increasing day by day, and the scale of construction is constantly expanding. The working class needs to have a corresponding development. The growth of the working class is the basic force for accelerating the realization of China's socialist industrialization. With the development of industrialization, China's working class will continue to grow in the future. This is one aspect. However, while expanding the working class, we must also pay attention to economizing on the use of labor force. The waste of labor force is the biggest waste in society, and the economization of labor force is also the biggest economization in society. In 1958, with the overall great leap forward in the national economy, China's social labor organization did have great improvements, and social labor resources were also used relatively fully and rationally. However, the phenomenon of state-owned enterprises recruiting employees without paying attention to economic accounting and wasting labor force in many places is still relatively common. If this phenomenon only affects the speed of increasing labor productivity within state-owned enterprises and increases the burden of urban supply when there is a surplus of labor force, then, under the current situation where both urban and rural labor forces are tight, enterprises improperly recruiting too many employees will have a great impact on the overall leap forward in the national economy, which cannot but attract our attention.
    Improving labor productivity is one of the major signs of saving manpower. Under normal circumstances, the higher the level of labor productivity and the faster the speed of improvement, the more economical and rational the use of labor force is. Of course, constantly improving labor productivity has its more significant political and economic significance. It is the most important condition for the socialist system to defeat the capitalist system and to transition to a communist society in the future. Constantly improving labor productivity can also reduce costs and create conditions for constantly increasing the wage level of employees. Therefore, improving labor productivity is the central link of many tasks, especially the central link of labor work, and is the key point of labor management work.
    Striving to save manpower and improving labor productivity more and faster is the inevitable trend of the continued great leap forward in the national economy. At present, before agricultural production realizes mechanization and electrification, labor force should not be drawn from agricultural production too much. Under the conditions of taking into account the needs of industrial and agricultural production, a part of the labor force should be appropriately drawn to support industry and support cities. At the same time, within industrial enterprises, we must fully tap potential, use labor force more economically and rationally, and improve labor productivity more and faster. Under the current situation where the production of means of livelihood is not very abundant, the urban population should not be increased too much or too quickly. Otherwise, it will unduly increase the burden of urban supply. Improving labor productivity more and faster currently has many favorable conditions. Under the inspiration of the Party's general line, the broad masses of employees have demonstrated soaring enthusiasm. This year, they are working with even greater enthusiasm than last year. Many old workers have learned to be "all-rounders," and new workers have also greatly improved their technical level after half a year of training. The extensive development of the technical revolution, the increasing degree of mechanization and electrification of production, the further improvement of labor organization and labor system, the correct implementation of the principle of distribution according to work, and the increasingly strengthened leadership of the Party committees at all levels over labor work, etc., have all provided favorable conditions for further improving labor productivity.
    Improve Labor Organization and Tap Potential
    Improving labor organization and tapping labor potential are the spirits that should always be implemented in the rational allocation and use of labor force. This requires all enterprises and units to first rely on tapping the potential within the enterprise, rather than relying on adding new employees. Adhere to the principle that the more production the better, and the less manpower the better. The work of improving labor organization and tapping labor potential roughly has the following three aspects: one is to improve social labor organization and tap social labor potential; the second is to improve the internal labor organization of enterprises and tap the internal labor potential of enterprises; and the third is to rationally organize and use the forces of office cadres, enterprise management cadres, army officers and soldiers participating in physical labor, and students practicing work-study programs. At the same time, it should also be noted that under the rational use of existing labor force, a large number of new labor resources should be discovered; when arranging the use of labor force, it is necessary to use people according to their abilities and make the best use of their talents; and reduce and eliminate the waste of labor force in use.
    Improving labor organization and tapping labor potential is a regular task, and its specific content is constantly developing with the development of production. In 1958, remarkable achievements and rich experiences were made in liberating women's labor force, adjusting the distribution of social labor force, reducing non-productive personnel, improving the internal labor organization of enterprises, and organizing "voluntary labor," which should continue to be consolidated and expanded.
    In the liberation of women's labor force, in addition to continuing to take steps to appropriately and actively develop collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, sewing groups, and laundry groups, attention should also be paid to the rational use and strengthened education of the liberated women's labor force, and constantly improve their awareness and cultural and technical level, so as to give full play to the role of women in participating in social labor. At present, many places have adopted the methods of exchanging shifts between men and women, exchanging shifts between the old and the young, and exchanging shifts between the strong and the weak, and have achieved many results. These methods are: for jobs that can be undertaken by women, male labor force is replaced; for jobs that can be undertaken by the elderly, young and middle-aged people are replaced; for jobs that can be undertaken by people with weaker bodies, people with strong bodies are replaced. After such adjustments, the young and strong male labor force is adjusted to the industrial and agricultural production front where they can fully play their role. Such a comprehensive adjustment of the social labor force can achieve "using people according to their abilities and making the best use of their talents." In addition, various administrative management departments and enterprise management departments should also constantly streamline their institutions, reduce the staff in non-material production departments and non-productive personnel within enterprises, and increase direct production personnel. Within each enterprise, the labor organization of work teams (classes, groups) should be further adjusted according to different circumstances, and the original phenomena of excessively detailed division of labor, lack of cooperation between work types, classes and groups, and between production teams and maintenance teams, uneven distribution of busy and idle work, and idling and waste should be gradually changed, and the spirit of communist cooperation should be greatly strengthened. The office cadres and army officers and soldiers who have been transferred to enterprises and rural areas and the students participating in labor-based work-study programs should also be arranged and used rationally in a planned way.
    Carry out Technical Revolution and Improve the Cultural Level of Employees
    Carrying out the technical revolution and improving the cultural and technical level of employees is the fundamental way to solve the shortage of labor force. In this regard, many tasks have been done across the country in 1958. With the communist spirit of daring to think and act, the broad masses of people have improved and invented many tools and machinery, and modified and innovated many old technological procedures. Many places and departments have replaced the heavy and inefficient labor such as carrying on the back, shouldering, carrying, and lifting with tools, and promoted the use of carts and roller bearings. Water conservancy projects have implemented the chute transportation method, and railway stations have implemented the elevated coal unloading method, etc., which have multiplied labor productivity and greatly saved labor force.
    At present, the degree of mechanization of production in China is still very low. Taking Shanghai as an example, only 27% of the workers in industrial enterprises in the city are engaged in mechanized operations, 36% are engaged in semi-mechanized operations, and 37% are engaged in manual operations. The low degree of mechanization is the root cause of the current labor shortage. To accelerate the elimination of the labor shortage, we must vigorously carry out the technical revolution, and we should first focus on jobs with high labor consumption and high labor intensity. We should adopt the method of first using indigenous methods and then foreign methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually improving from low to high levels to achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization. Doing so is not only necessary but also conditional, especially in areas where the labor shortage is relatively serious and the industrial base is relatively strong, it is even more necessary to accelerate this work.
    In 1958, while vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, the broad masses of people set off a wave of learning technology and culture, and many enterprises established "Red and Expert" schools. The all-rounder movement, which developed from the construction industry, is of extremely important significance for alleviating the current labor shortage, improving the technical level of China's working class, and rationally using the labor force. Because the technical level of workers in China is still very low, and a large number of new employees were added in 1958, among the existing employees in China, those with only one skill are still in the majority. In order to meet the needs of the continued great leap forward in production, it is obviously very important to carry out the all-rounder movement more widely.
    Improve the Labor System and Strengthen Management
    In order to enable enterprises in cities to timely obtain the labor force needed for replenishment from rural areas, and also to arrange for a part of the workers to re-engage or temporarily engage in agricultural production when there are surplus personnel, so as to avoid idling and waste, the labor system should be further improved. This requires, on the one hand, paying attention to facilitating the deployment of labor force and fully utilizing the existing manpower of the enterprise, and on the other hand, consolidating the production responsibility system to promote and ensure the rational allocation and use of labor force within the enterprise.
    In terms of labor management, in the future, we should mainly strengthen planning and act according to plan. The increase in employees in state-owned enterprises and institutions should be appropriately controlled. In this way, enterprises can be urged to tap their internal potential and prevent inappropriate over-increase of employees, resulting in waste; it is also conducive to preventing the large-scale flow of rural labor force. Therefore, appropriately controlling the recruitment of employees is not just a passive measure, but an active measure. Labor quotas, norms, and labor statistics are the necessary basis for compiling labor plans. The more detailed the labor planning work, the higher the requirements for these tasks. Therefore, we must always pay attention to strengthening these tasks. The situation of temporary surplus or temporary shortage of labor force within enterprises will always occur frequently. In order to avoid the waste and shortage of labor force caused by this, the most important method is to strengthen the adjustment of labor force and organize the temporary borrowing of surplus and shortage of labor force between enterprises. Facts have proved that only by strengthening the management of labor force can the role of labor planning work be brought into play. Making the relationship between industrial and agricultural production compatible in the allocation and use of labor force is a necessary condition for ensuring the planned and proportional development of the national economy.

　　关于合理分配和使用劳动力的几个问题
    刘涤尘
    随着工农业生产大跃进和全国农村实现人民公社化，我国社会劳动力的状况，发生了一个极为深刻的变化：社会失业现象根本消灭了，一切有劳动能力的人基本上都参加了力所能及的劳动，而且无论城市或农村，都感到劳动力紧张。在我们有六亿多人口的大国中，感到劳动力不足，这是一件大好事。它证明我国工农业生产正在大发展。从前，那种认为我国人多，吃饭就业问题不能解决的反动论调，在事实面前已完全破产。
    毛主席早就说过：“社会主义不仅从旧社会解放了劳动者和生产资料，也解放了旧社会所无法利用的广大的自然界。人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。……因为生产的范围大了，部门多了，工作细了，这就不怕有力无处使。”事实证明毛主席这一论断的正确性。
    党的八届六中全会所提出的，以钢、煤、粮、棉四大生产指标为中心的1959年国民经济发展计划，是一个比1958年更加宏伟的跃进计划。实现这个计划需要更多的劳力，因此，统一规划，全面安排，把现有劳动力使用在关节上，结合技术改革，提高劳动生产率，充分发挥劳动力的作用，是一个十分迫切的问题。
    统一规划，全面安排
    合理分配和使用劳动力，首先要采取统一规划全面安排的方针，也就是在安排劳动力方面，贯彻全国一盘棋的方针。劳动力的分配和使用，是发展生产的一个根本环节，要保证国民经济的全国一盘棋，没有劳动力分配和使用上的全国一盘棋是不可能的。
    在人民公社化和全面大跃进以前，由于社会劳动力还有富余，那时，对社会劳动力的全面安排，把重点放在国营企业、事业部门和机关团体的用人数量、技术工人培养指标和补充职工的来源上，这不仅是由于当时所有制形式所限制，而且和当时的生产发展情况也是相适应的。1958年的工农业生产大跃进，和全国农村实现人民公社化，这就给统一规划、全面安排社会劳动力，进一步提供了更有利的条件。
    劳动力的全面安排和合理使用，最主要的办法是根据生产的需要，在生产各部门（农业部门、工业部门、运输部门）之间确定使用劳动力的适当比例，在经常性生产任务、突击性生产任务之间合理调度劳动力，在农村划出支援城市劳动力的数目，建立预备工区或预备工制度。
    按比例地分配使用劳动力，是国民经济按比例发展所要求的。这样可以灵活地调节和调度人力，以避免有事无人做，有人无事做的现象，大大减少和消除使用劳动力的浪费现象。劳动力的安排，是为生产服务的，这是问题的一方面。另一方面，生产的安排也要充分考虑到劳动力的条件和可能，并且要千方百计地节省使用劳动力。这是生产与劳动力的相互关系。生产与劳动力要同时统一规划、全面安排，才能使两者之间保持正确的比例关系，才有利于发展生产。在国营企业里，增加新职工时，还应该注意经济核算，严格实行定员管理，防止一时增人过多的现象发生。对农村劳动力的安排，不仅关系到农村生产的全面跃进，而且直接关系到对城市大中型企业的支援。
    合理分配和使用劳动力，还必须精确掌握劳动资源，使社会上所有的人都参加力所能及的劳动，采取积极措施，使劳动资源和需要之间保持一定的平衡。目前劳动力紧张，的确是事实，但是，我国劳动资源还是很丰富的，这不仅因为人多劳动力多，而且我国人民有勤劳的优良传统，在党的领导和教育下，政治觉悟不断提高，又有教育与生产劳动相结合、干部参加体力劳动、两参一改三结合等一系列的政策和制度，只要把这些因素都调动起来，并加以统一规划，全面安排，就可以发挥出更大的劳动潜力，挖出更多的劳动资源。
    同时，要作好劳动力的统一规划，全面安排，一方面要根据生产建设的安排和需要劳动力的情况，分别主次、先后、轻重、缓急的不同，局部服从整体，首先保证完成钢、煤、粮、棉四大生产指标的需要。另方面也要大力组织城乡之间、企业之间以及企业内部劳动力的协作，互相调剂，灵活调度。
    尽快地提高劳动生产率，节约使用劳动力
    各经济部门增加生产的途径，不外两个方面，一是增加新的工人队伍，一是提高劳动生产率。
    新企业日益增加，建设规模不断扩大，工人阶级队伍需要有相应的发展。工人阶级队伍的壮大，是加速实现我国社会主义工业化的基本力量，随着工业化的发展，我国工人阶级队伍在今后还要不断壮大，这是一方面；但是，在壮大工人阶级队伍的同时，还必须注意节约使用劳动力。劳动力的浪费，是社会上最大的浪费，劳动力的节约，也是社会上最大的节约。1958年，随着国民经济的全面大跃进，我国社会劳动组织确有很大改进，社会劳动资源，也有了比较充分合理的利用。然而，国营企业招收职工不注意经济核算，许多地方浪费劳动力的现象，还是比较普遍存在的。这种现象，如果说在原来劳动力有富余的情况下，它只能影响国营企业内部提高劳动生产率的速度，加重城市供应，那末，在现在城乡劳动力都呈现紧张的情况下，企业不适当地多招收职工，就会对国民经济全面跃进发生很大的影响，这不能不引起我们的注意。
    提高劳动生产率，是节约人力的重大标志之一。在正常情况下，劳动生产率水平越高，提高的速度越快，就说明劳动力的使用越节约、越合理。当然，不断提高劳动生产率，还有其更重大的政治意义和经济意义。它是社会主义制度战胜资本主义制度，以及将来过渡到共产主义社会的最重要的条件。不断提高劳动生产率，还可以降低成本，为不断提高职工工资水平创造条件。所以，提高劳动生产率是许多工作的中心环节，尤其是劳动工作的中心环节，是劳动管理工作的纲。
    努力节约人力，更多更快地提高劳动生产率，是国民经济继续大跃进的必然趋势。在目前，当农业生产未实现机械化、电气化以前，不应该过分地从农业生产方面抽调劳动力，而应当在兼顾工农业生产需要的条件下，适当抽调一部分劳动力支援工业、支援城市。同时，在工业企业内部，必须充分挖掘潜力，更节约更合理地使用劳动力，更多更快地提高劳动生产率。在目前生活资料的生产还不很丰富的情况下，城市人口也不宜增加得过多过快。否则，就会过分加重城市供应的负担。更多更快地提高劳动生产率，在目前有许多有利条件，在党的总路线的鼓舞下，广大职工群众发挥了冲天干劲，今年比去年干劲更大。许多老工人学会了“多面手”，新工人经过了半年来的训练，技术水平也有很大提高。技术革命的广泛开展，生产的机械化、电气化程度日益增长，劳动组织和劳动制度进一步改进，按劳分配原则的正确贯彻执行，各级党委对劳动工作的领导日益加强，等等，都给进一步提高劳动生产率提供了有利条件。
    改善劳动组织，挖掘潜力
    改善劳动组织，挖掘劳动潜力，是合理分配和使用劳动力所始终应当贯彻的精神。这就是要求各企业单位，首先依靠挖掘企业内部的潜力，而不是首先依靠增加新职工。坚持生产越多越好，用人越少越好的原则。改善劳动组织，挖掘劳动潜力的工作，大体说来有以下三个方面：一是改善社会劳动组织，挖掘社会劳动潜力；二是改善企业内部的劳动组织，挖掘企业内部的劳动潜力；三是合理地组织和使用机关干部、企业管理干部、军队官兵参加体力劳动和学生实行勤工俭学的力量。同时还应当注意到，在合理使用现有劳动力的情况下，大量发掘新的劳动资源；在安排使用劳动力时要做到因人使用，人尽其才；减少和消除劳动力使用上的浪费现象。
    改善劳动组织，挖掘劳动潜力，是一项经常性的工作，它的具体内容，也是随着生产的发展而不断向前发展的。1958年，在解放妇女劳动力、调整社会劳动力的分布、缩减非生产人员、改善企业内部劳动组织、组织“义务劳动”等方面，都取得了显著成绩和丰富经验，应该继续加以巩固和扩大。
    在解放妇女劳动力方面，除了继续采取步骤，适当地积极发展公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、缝纫组、洗衣组等集体福利事业之外，对解放出来的妇女劳动力，还应当注意合理使用，加强教育，不断地提高觉悟程度和文化技术水平，以充分发挥妇女参加社会劳动的作用。目前有许多地方采取了男女换班、老少换班、强弱换班的办法，已经取得不少成绩。这种办法是：凡是可以由妇女负担的工作，换出男劳动力；凡是可以由老年人负担的工作，换出青壮年人，凡是可以由身体较弱的人负担的工作，换出身体强的人。经过这样的调剂，把年轻力壮的男劳动力调整到可以充分发挥作用的工农业生产战线上去。这样全面地调整社会劳动力，就可以做到“因人使用，人尽其才”。此外，各行政管理部门和企业管理部门，还应当经常不断的精简机构，缩减非物质生产部门的工作人员，和企业内部的非生产人员，增加直接生产人员。在各企业内部，要根据不同情况进一步调整工作队（班、组）的劳动组织，逐步改变原来分工过细，工种间、班组间、生产队与检修队之间互不配合、忙闲不均、窝工浪费的现象，大大加强共产主义协作的精神。下放到各企业、农村的机关干部、军队官兵和参加劳动的勤工俭学的学生，也应当有计划地安排和合理使用。
    开展技术革命，提高职工文化水平
    开展技术革命，提高职工的文化技术水平，是解决劳动力不足的根本途径。在这一方面，1958年全国各地都作了许多工作，广大群众以敢想敢干的共产主义精神，改进和创造发明了许多工具和机械，修改和革新了许多旧的工艺规程。许多地方和部门，把原来背、扛、挑、抬等繁重而效率又低的劳动，用工具来代替，推行车子化，滚珠轴承化。水利工程实行滑道运输法，火车站实行高台卸煤法等等，都成倍地提高了劳动生产率，大大节省了劳动力。
    目前我国生产的机械化程度还很低，以上海来说，全市工业企业的工人从事机械化操作的仅占27％，半机械化操作的占36％，手工操作的占37％。机械化程度低，是目前劳动力紧张的根本原因。要加速消除劳动力紧张状态，就必须大力开展技术革命，并且应当首先抓劳动消耗多、劳动强度大的工作，采取先土后洋，土洋结合，由低级到高级步步提高的办法，实现半机械化和机械化。这样做，不仅是必要的，也是有条件的，尤其是那些劳动力紧张程度比较严重而工业基础又比较强的地区，更需要加速进行这项工作。
    1958年在大搞技术革命的同时，广大群众掀起了学习技术文化的热潮，许多企业都办了红专学校。从建筑业发展起来的多面手运动，对于缓和目前劳动力紧张局势，提高我国工人阶级的技术水平，合理地使用劳动力，都具有极为重要的意义。由于我国工人技术水平还很低，1958年又增加了一大批新职工，在我国现有职工中，只有一技之长的仍属多数。为了满足生产继续大跃进中劳动力的需要，更广泛地开展多面手运动，显然是十分重要的。
    改进劳动制度，加强管理
    为了使城市中的企业，既能够及时地从农村中获得需要补充的劳动力，又能够在人员多余的时候安排一部分工人重新或暂时去从事农业生产，以避免窝工浪费，就要进一步改进劳动制度。这就要求一方面注意有利于调度劳动力，充分利用本企业现有人力，另方面还应该巩固生产责任制，以促进和保证企业内部合理分配使用劳动力。
    在劳动管理方面，今后主要应当加强计划性，按计划办事。对国营企业、事业部门增加职工，要适当控制。这样，既可以促使企业挖掘内部潜力，防止不适当的过多增加职工，造成浪费；又有利于防止农村劳动力的大量流动。所以，适当控制招用职工，并不只是一个消极措施，而是一个积极措施。劳动定员、定额和劳动统计，是编制劳动计划的必要基础。劳动计划工作愈作愈细致，对这些工作的要求也越高。因此，必须经常注意加强这些工作。企业内部劳动力暂时多余或暂时短缺的情况，总是会常常发生的。为了避免由此而产生的劳动力浪费和不足，最重要的办法是加强劳动力的调剂，组织企业之间劳动力余缺的临时借调工作。事实证明，只有加强劳动力的管理，才便于发挥劳动计划工作的作用，在劳动力的分配使用上，使工农业生产间保持相适应的关系，是保证国民经济有计划按比例的发展的必要条件。
