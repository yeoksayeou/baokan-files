Comrade Chairman, Fellow Deputies,

Today, at this meeting of great historical significance, I would first like to express my sincere support for Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state final accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. This time, representative Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme and I came to Beijing to attend the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, gathering with representatives of all ethnic groups across the country to discuss national affairs together, which once again fully demonstrates that under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, the people of Tibet and all ethnic groups in the country truly enjoy national equality and the right to be masters of their own affairs. (Prolonged enthusiastic applause)

Since the First Session of the First National People's Congress, over the past four years, tremendous changes have taken place in our great motherland. Our country is more unified and consolidated; the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country has also been unprecedentedly strengthened; our country has not only victoriously overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan but also achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in 1958, making the magnificent rivers and mountains of more than nine million square kilometers present an extremely prosperous scene. Now, more than 600 million people continue to advance bravely with full confidence in victory. All of this fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. (Enthusiastic applause)

The Central People's Government has consistently adhered to the Seventeen-Article Agreement, but the former Tibetan local government has consistently engaged in activities to undermine the Seventeen-Article Agreement.

Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army and personnel entering Tibet have consistently adhered to the Seventeen-Article Agreement, consistently upheld the principles of national reunification, ethnic unity, and freedom of religious belief, and have taken active measures to support the economic and cultural development of Tibet, achieving great results and receiving enthusiastic support and love from the Tibetan people. However, for a long time, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, under the direction of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and foreign reactionaries, have consistently engaged in activities to split the motherland and undermine the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and have done everything possible to obstruct the progress of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region. The central government, in order to wait for the repentance of the reactionary elements, has repeatedly exercised forbearance and done everything humanly possible, but the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet not only did not repent but also believed that the central government was weak and could be deceived. In March of this year, they openly kidnapped the Dalai Lama and launched a full-scale armed rebellion. The sinister goal of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet was to once again place the Tibetan people under the enslavement of imperialism and to permanently preserve the darkest and most brutal serf system in the world. The rebellion in the Lhasa area was quickly quelled, and the reactionary elements' treasonous plot suffered a shameful defeat. In the process of quelling the rebellion, the monks and laypeople and patriotic upper and middle-class figures in Tibet enthusiastically supported Premier Zhou Enlai's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government and actively helped the People's Liberation Army quell the rebellion. Their long-suppressed desire for reform was also brought up one after another. (Applause)

The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" was imposed on him by foreigners.

When I saw the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian foreign officials in Tezpur on April 18, I felt extremely angry. This so-called statement, whether compared with the Dalai Lama's usual words and deeds or with the three personal letters written by the Dalai Lama to Tan Guansan, the central government's acting representative, has nothing in common. The tone of the statement is neither the Dalai Lama's own tone nor the tone we Tibetans are accustomed to using. It is very clear that this so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" was imposed on him by foreigners.

Some Indians are now talking about "Tibetan independence," which is no different from what the British aggressors said in the past.

Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, which no one can deny. (Applause) Since ancient times, Tibet has had close political, economic, and cultural ties with the interior of the motherland. By the 13th century, Tibet was formally incorporated into the territory of China. Since then, Tibet has always been Chinese territory. (Applause) Does the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" say that Tibetans are different from Han people, and can this be used as an argument for "independence"? As everyone knows, in addition to the Han nationality, our country also has more than 50 minority nationalities, and these nationalities are not only different from the Han nationality but also have their own different ethnic characteristics. They are different as nationalities, but as far as the motherland is concerned, they are all members of the motherland's big family. (Prolonged applause) There are many other multi-ethnic countries in the world. Therefore, the difference in nationality can never be used as an excuse to split the motherland. The statement says that "Tibetans have always had a strong desire for independence," which is a completely fabricated lie. In fact, the vast majority of Tibetan people, like the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, believe that safeguarding the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups and opposing imperialist aggression are their most fundamental interests. (Enthusiastic applause) The Tibetan people understand from their own experience that the inevitable result of breaking away from the motherland is not Tibetan independence, but turning Tibet into a foreign colony and protectorate. (Applause) We know that the so-called "Tibetan independence" was first proposed by the British. British aggressors launched a large-scale attack on Tibet in 1904, massacred many Tibetan compatriots, and armed occupied Lhasa. Later, Britain not only painstakingly tried to split Tibet from China, not allowing the Chinese government to "interfere in Tibet's internal affairs," but also created a painful division within Tibet. Under the poisonous hands of the British aggressors and their running dogs, the previous Bainqen was forced to leave, the Reting Rinpoche was murdered, the Gedha Rinpoche was poisoned to death, and the Dalai Lama's father was also poisoned to death. These are the bloody lessons that the so-called "Tibetan independence" has given us! Some Indians are now talking about "Tibetan independence" again, or saying something like "recognizing China's suzerainty but not allowing China to interfere in Tibet's internal affairs." May I ask: Why can't China manage China's affairs, but others can? (Applause) What is the difference between this and what the British said before? I don't see any difference! (Applause) This kind of talk is only supported by imperialists, colonialists, and reactionaries all over the world. The Indian people and the people of all countries do not support it, and all people in India who advocate the Five Principles, cherish Sino-Indian friendship, and truly sympathize with the Tibetan people also do not support it. We Tibetan people are resolutely opposed to it. (Enthusiastic applause) I, on behalf of all Tibetan monks and laypeople, solemnly declare to all representatives of the National People's Congress here: Tibet will forever be China's Tibet! (Stormy applause) We will never allow any foreigners to interfere in our Tibetan affairs and our Chinese affairs! (Prolonged enthusiastic applause)

The upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet waved the banner of so-called "independence," which is exactly the same as the "independence" banner hung by the Manchu traitor Puyi in the past.

As an autonomous region of the motherland, Tibet enjoys the right to national regional autonomy, which is not a problem. As everyone knows, national regional autonomy is the basic policy of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government for solving our country's national problems. This policy has been written into our country's constitution and is also clearly stipulated in the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Article 3 of the agreement states: "In accordance with the national policies stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Tibetan people have the right to exercise regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government." As early as 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region had already been established, and the Dalai Lama was appointed as the chairman of the Preparatory Committee. Some of the work carried out by the Preparatory Committee in the past was carried out under the personal leadership of the Dalai Lama, after full consultation and decision by people from all walks of life. The vast majority of the members and cadres of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region are also Tibetan people from all walks of life. All of this is an ironclad fact. As for why the work of the Preparatory Committee has not been carried out very well, it is the result of obstruction and sabotage by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique. The upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet has consistently obstructed the work of the Preparatory Committee, persecuted Tibetan cadres and patriotic progressive people, created disunity between Tibetans and Han people and within Tibet, opposed any democratic and progressive measure. Although Tibet has been liberated for eight years, the political system and social system in Tibet have not changed. How can it be said that the Tibetan local government has not enjoyed any degree of autonomy? I believe that as far as the relationship between the central government and the local government is concerned, it is completely appropriate and normal for the central government to lead and supervise the work of the local government. In the past, the central government did not manage the work of the former Tibetan local government too much, but in fact, managed it too little. Since the liberation eight years ago, the central government has consistently adhered to the policy of national unity towards the former Tibetan local government, being broad-minded, but unexpectedly, those stubborn reactionary elements thought that the central government was weak and could be deceived, and even became insane, betraying the motherland and betraying the people. Facts have proved that what they want is not the autonomous rights of Tibet, but the so-called "independence" of Tibet, and in fact, it is not the "independence" of Tibet, but an attempt to sell out the country and seek glory under the banner of "independence," to maintain their reactionary rule. (Applause) This so-called "independence" banner is exactly the same as the "independence" banner of the "Manchukuo" that the Manchu traitor Puyi hung when he relied on the Japanese aggressors. (Applause)

The upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet shouted "protecting religion," but consistently engaged in evil deeds that undermined religion and murdered patriotic living Buddhas.

In terms of treating religion, the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet have earnestly implemented the policy of protecting freedom of religious belief and protecting lama temples. For eight years, Tibet's religious system and religious beliefs have not changed. This is a fact that all Tibetan monks and laypeople have witnessed. In fact, it is not the People's Liberation Army that is undermining religion, but those rebels and reactionary elements in Tibet. They kill and insult monks and nuns, desecrate Buddhist statues, rob offerings, and even use temples as strongholds for rebellion. Obviously, this is not a good deed that respects religion, but an evil deed that undermines religion. Moreover, they kidnapped the Dalai Lama and fled abroad. This is the greatest destruction of Tibetan religion. (Applause) The former Tibetan local government paid lip service to protecting religion, but consistently engaged in activities that undermined religion. In history, they attacked the Sera Monastery, cruelly murdered the patriotic Reting Rinpoche, and later poisoned the Dalai Lama's patriotic father. Are these crimes also called "protecting religion"? Facts have proved that the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, they shouted protecting religion, but in fact, they used religion to deceive the people in order to maintain their ruling position. (Applause)

No matter how cleverly disguised, any imperialist and foreign reactionary forces cannot deceive the Tibetan people.

Now, the situation in Tibet is completely under the control of the People's Liberation Army's Tibet Military Region and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. The troops of the People's Liberation Army, with the active support of Tibetan monks and laypeople, are continuing to wipe out the remaining bandits. I believe that in the shortest possible time, the remaining bandits in the Tibetan area will be completely eliminated, and the Tibetan people will embark on the bright path of prosperity and progress. (Enthusiastic applause) The conspiracy of Tibetan rebels to create independence has gone bankrupt. (Applause) These rebels, under the direction of their foreign masters, are engaging in activities to undermine and split the motherland in the name of the Dalai Lama, which is completely futile. Imperialism is doing its best to use this incident to undermine Sino-Indian relations, which cannot be allowed. It is worth pointing out that the Indian reactionaries have inherited the mantle of British imperialism and have always harbored expansionist ambitions towards Tibet and carried out various destructive activities. There is no doubt that this kind of activity is only beneficial to imperialism and not conducive to Sino-Indian friendship. (Applause)

Imperialists and foreign reactionaries dress themselves up as friends of the Tibetan people, just like ferocious demons dressing up as benevolent Bodhisattvas. But the eyes of the Tibetan people who have suffered foreign aggression for many years are discerning. They can clearly distinguish who is a friend and who is an enemy. No matter how cleverly disguised, any imperialist and foreign reactionary forces cannot deceive people. (Applause)

Thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits, gradually implement the task of reform, consolidate and develop the friendship between the Han and Tibetan peoples, and strive to build a democratic and progressive new Tibet.

The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has exercised the functions of the Tibetan local government in accordance with the order of the State Council. During the Dalai Lama's abduction, I acted as the chairman of the Preparatory Committee in accordance with the order of the State Council. I am determined to unite all Tibetan cadres and monks and laypeople under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and strive to complete the glorious mission entrusted to me by the country and the people. (Enthusiastic applause) Thoroughly eliminating the remaining bandits is the primary task in the Tibetan area at present. Although the rebellion has basically been quelled, in some remote areas, there are still some sporadic remnants of bandits carrying out harassment activities. They, like the Te-do-do-jie (Note: According to Buddhist scriptures, this is the name of a demon who specializes in harming people), demons, commit all kinds of evils such as rape, arson, and murder, seriously disrupting the lives and production of the people in those areas. The Tibetan people must continue to actively assist the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits in these areas, maintain social order, and consolidate national defense. (Enthusiastic and prolonged applause)

Gradually carrying out reforms and taking the path of democracy and socialism is the only broad road to prosperity and happiness for our Tibetan people. (Enthusiastic applause) The old system in Tibet cruelly oppressed the vast working people. If it is not reformed, the poor and backward face of the Tibetan area cannot be changed. This is like not being able to escape the sea of suffering and reach the happy land of bliss without going through the sea of compassion. The people of Tibet have long actively demanded reform, and a large number of upper-class figures also agree to carry out reforms for the sake of Tibet's development prospects. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region should gradually implement the task of reform through consultation with patriotic people from all walks of life, and strive to build a democratic and progressive new Tibet. (Prolonged enthusiastic applause)

Strengthening the unity of the Han and Tibetan peoples, as well as the people of all ethnic groups, is the fundamental guarantee for the progress and development of the Tibetan people. (Applause) Without the help of the Han nationality, the security and development of the Tibetan area would be unimaginable. The Tibetan people must respect the friendship between the Han and Tibetan peoples as much as they respect the Three Jewels (Note: The Three Jewels refer to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha) and constantly consolidate and develop this friendship. (Prolonged enthusiastic applause)

Finally, I sincerely hope that the Dalai Lama can get rid of the abducted situation and return to the embrace of the motherland to build a bright and happy new Tibet together with the Tibetan people. (Enthusiastic and prolonged applause)

Let us shout:

Long live the People's Republic of China! (Applause)

Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups in China! (Applause)

Long live the new Tibet that is moving towards prosperity and happiness in the big family of the motherland! (Enthusiastic applause)

Long live the Communist Party of China! (Enthusiastic applause)

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities! (Stormy and prolonged applause) (Note: The title and subheadings were added by the editor)

    西藏永远是中国的西藏  永远不许任何外国人干涉
    班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞代表在全国人民代表大会会议上的发言主席、各位代表：
    今天，在这个具有伟大历史意义的大会上，我首先表示竭诚拥护周总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告、彭真副委员长关于人大常务委员会工作的报告。这次我和阿沛·阿旺晋美等代表来到北京出席第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，和全国各民族的代表欢聚一堂，共同商讨国家大事，这又一次充分说明，在伟大的中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，西藏人民和全国各族人民真正地享受着民族平等和当家作主的权利。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    从第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议到现在，四年多来，我们的伟大祖国已经发生了巨大的变化，我们的国家更加统一和巩固；我国各族人民的团结也空前地加强了；我国不仅已经胜利超额地完成了第一个五年计划，而且实现了史无前例的一九五八年的大跃进，使九百多万平方公里的大好山河呈现出一片极其欣欣向荣的景象。现在六亿多人民继续满怀胜利信心奋勇前进。所有这一切，都充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
  （热烈鼓掌）
    中央人民政府始终不渝地履行十七条协议，原西藏地方政府却一贯进行破坏十七条协议的活动
    西藏和平解放以来，由于中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导，进藏的人民解放军和工作人员始终不渝的履行十七条协议，一贯坚持祖国统一、民族团结和宗教信仰自由的原则，并采取了积极的措施，来扶助西藏地方的经济和文化的发展，取得了很大的成绩，受到了西藏人民的热烈拥护和爱戴。但是，长期以来，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团在帝国主义、蒋匪帮和外国反动派的指使下，一贯进行分裂祖国、破坏祖国、破坏十七条协议的活动，并且百般阻挠自治区筹委会工作的进展。中央为了等待反动分子的悔悟，一再忍让，做到了仁至义尽，而西藏的上层反动分子不但没有悔改，反而认为中央软弱可欺，竟在今年三月，公然劫持达赖喇嘛，公然发动了全面武装叛乱。西藏上层反动集团的罪恶目的是：把西藏人民重新置于帝国主义的奴役之下，并且永远保存世界上最黑暗、最残酷的农奴制度。拉萨地区的叛乱迅速平息，反动分子的叛国阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。在平息叛乱的过程中，西藏的僧俗人民和爱国的上层、中层人士都热忱地拥护周恩来总理解散原西藏地方政府的命令，积极帮助人民解放军平息叛乱，他们一向被压制的要求改革的愿望也纷纷提了出来。（鼓掌）
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，是外国人强加于他的
    当我看到四月十八日在提斯浦尔经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”以后，感到无比的愤怒。这个所谓声明，无论同达赖喇嘛平时的言行或者同达赖喇嘛给中央代理代表谭冠三的三封亲笔信对照看来，都是毫无共同之处的。声明的口吻既不是达赖喇嘛本人的口吻，也不是我们藏人所习用的口吻。很显然，这个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，是外国人强加于他的。
    现在有些印度人在说什么“西藏独立”，这和过去英国侵略者的话没有什么分别
    西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这是任何人都不能加以否认的。（鼓掌）很早以来，西藏就和祖国内地发生政治、经济和文化上的密切联系。到十三世纪的时候，西藏地方就正式加入了中国的版图。从此以后，西藏就一直是中国的领土。（鼓掌）这个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”说：西藏人不同于汉人，这能够作为“独立”的论据么？大家知道，我国除了汉族以外，还有五十多个少数民族，这些民族不但都不同于汉族，而且彼此之间各有其不同的民族特点。他们作为民族是不同的，但是对祖国来说，他们都是祖国大家庭的一员。
  （经久不息的掌声）世界上别的多民族的国家很多。因此，民族的不同决不能作为分裂祖国的借口。声明说“西藏人一向有一种要求独立的强烈愿望”，这完全是捏造的谎言。事实上西藏绝大多数人民和祖国各族人民一样，认为维护祖国的统一和各民族的团结，反对帝国主义侵略，是自己最根本的利益。（热烈鼓掌）西藏人民根据切身的经验懂得：脱离祖国的必然结果，并不是什么西藏的独立，而是把西藏变作外国的殖民地和保护国。（鼓掌）我们知道，所谓“西藏独立”，首先是英国人提出来的。英国侵略者在一九○四年大举进攻西藏，屠杀很多藏胞，武装占领拉萨。以后英国不但处心积虑要把西藏从中国分裂出去，不许中国政府“干涉西藏内政”，而且在西藏内部也制造了惨痛的分裂。在英国侵略者及其走狗的毒手之下，前辈班禅被迫出走了，热振活佛被残杀了，格达活佛被毒死了，达赖喇嘛的父亲也被毒死了。这些就是所谓“西藏独立”给我们的血的教训！现在有些印度人又在说什么“西藏独立”，或者说什么“承认中国的宗主权，但是不许中国干涉西藏内政”。试问：中国的事情为什么中国管不得，别人反而管得呢？（鼓掌）这和英国人以前讲的话有什么分别呢？我看什么分别也没有！（鼓掌）这种话在全世界只有帝国主义者、殖民主义者和反动派赞成，印度人民和各国人民都是不赞成的，印度的一切主张五项原则、珍惜中印友好、真正同情西藏人民的人士，也是不赞成的。我们西藏人民是坚决反对的。（热烈鼓掌）我代表全体西藏僧俗人民在这里对全国人民代表大会全体代表郑重声明：我们西藏永远是中国的西藏，（暴风雨般的掌声）我们永远不许任何外国人干涉我们西藏和我们中国的事情！（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    西藏上层反动集团打着所谓“独立”的招牌，同过去满奸溥仪所挂的“独立”招牌完全是一回事
    西藏作为祖国的一个自治地方，享有民族区域自治的权利，这是没有问题的。大家知道，民族地方自治是中国共产党和中央人民政府解决我国民族问题的基本政策。这个政策已载入我们国家的宪法，并且在和平解放西藏办法的协议中也有明文规定。协议的第三条写着：“根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的民族政策，在中央人民政府统一领导之下，西藏人民有实行区域自治的权利。”早在一九五六年，西藏自治区筹备委员会就已经成立了，达赖喇嘛被任命为筹备委员会的主任委员。筹备委员会过去所进行过的一些工作，都是在达赖喇嘛亲自主持下，经过各方面人士的充分协商决定以后进行的。自治区筹备委员会的委员和干部绝大部分也都是各阶层的藏族人士。这一切都是铁一般的事实。至于筹备委员会的工作没有很好的开展，那是因为原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团阻挠和破坏的结果。西藏上层反动集团一贯阻挠筹备委员会的工作，迫害藏族干部和爱国进步人士，制造藏汉之间和西藏内部的不团结，反对任何民主和进步的措施。西藏解放虽然已有八年了，但是，西藏地方的政治制度和社会制度都没有改变。这怎能说西藏地方政府没有享受任何程度的自治呢？我认为就中央和地方的关系来说，中央领导和检查地方政府的工作，是完全应当的和正常的现象。过去中央对原西藏地方政府的工作不是管的太多，而实在是管的太少了。解放八年以来，中央对原西藏地方政府一贯本着民族团结政策，宽大为怀，不料那些顽固不化的反动分子，却以为中央是软弱可欺，竟至丧心病狂，背叛祖国，背叛人民。事实证明，他们所要的不是什么西藏的自治权利，而是西藏的所谓“独立”，事实上也不是什么西藏的“独立”，而是企图借“独立”的招牌来卖国求荣，来维持他们的反动统治。（鼓掌）这种所谓“独立”的招牌，同过去满奸溥仪投靠日本侵略者所挂的“满洲国”的“独立”招牌，完全是一回事。（鼓掌）
    西藏上层反动集团高喊“护教”，却一贯干着破坏宗教和残杀爱国活佛的恶行
    在对待宗教方面，共产党和进入西藏的人民解放军，切实执行了保护宗教信仰自由和保护喇嘛寺庙的政策。八年以来，西藏的宗教制度和宗教信仰，都没有改变。这是全藏僧俗人民有目共睹的事实，实际上破坏宗教的不是人民解放军，而是西藏的那些叛乱分子和反动分子。他们杀害和污辱僧尼，玷污佛像，抢劫供奉器物，甚至把寺院作为叛乱的据点。显然这不是尊重宗教的善行，而是破坏宗教的恶行。况且他们劫持达赖喇嘛逃亡国外。这就是对西藏宗教的最大的破坏。（鼓掌）原西藏地方政府口口声声说保护宗教，却一贯地干着破坏宗教的勾当。他们在历史上曾经攻打过色拉寺，残杀了爱国的热振活佛，并且在以后毒死了达赖喇嘛的爱国的父亲。他们这些罪行，难道也叫做“保护宗教”吗？事实证明：原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，他们高喊护教，实际上是借宗教来欺骗人民，以便维持他们的统治地位。（鼓掌）
    任何帝国主义和外国反动派，不管怎样巧加打扮都骗不了西藏人民现在，西藏的局势已经完全在人民解放军西藏军区和西藏自治区筹备委员会的控制之下，人民解放军的部队，在西藏僧俗人民的积极支持下，正在继续扫荡残余叛匪。我相信在最短期间，西藏地区的残余叛匪定会全部肃清，西藏人民将走上繁荣进步的光明大道。（热烈鼓掌）西藏叛乱分子制造独立的阴谋已经破产了。（鼓掌）这些叛乱分子在他们的外国主子的指使下，假借达赖喇嘛的名义从事破坏分裂祖国的活动，是完全无济于事的。帝国主义极力利用这个事件破坏中印关系，这是不能允许的。值得指出的是印度的反动派继承了英帝国主义的衣钵，一直对西藏存在扩张野心，并且进行种种破坏活动。毫无疑问，这种活动只是对帝国主义有利，而不利于中印友好的。（鼓掌）
    帝国主义者和外国反动派把自己装扮成西藏人民的朋友，犹如凶恶的魔鬼，装扮成慈善的菩萨一样。但是多年来遭受过外国侵略的西藏人民的眼睛是雪亮的。谁是朋友、谁是敌人，他们能够清楚地分辨出来。任何帝国主义和外国反动派，不管怎样巧加打扮都是骗不了人的。（鼓掌）
    彻底肃清残余的匪徒，逐步实现改革的任务，巩固和发展汉藏人民的友谊，努力建设民主的进步的新西藏
    西藏自治区筹备委员会依照国务院的命令，已经行使了西藏地方政府的职权。在达赖喇嘛被劫持期间，我遵照国务院的命令代理主任委员的职务。我决心在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，团结西藏全体干部和僧俗人民，努力完成国家和人民交付给我的光荣的使命。（热烈鼓掌）彻底肃清残匪是当前西藏地区的首要任务。现在叛乱虽已基本平息，但是在一些偏僻的地区，还有一些零星残匪进行骚扰活动。他们象堆·德格多杰（按：根据佛经记载，这是一种专门残害人的魔鬼的名子。）魔鬼般的奸淫烧杀，无恶不作，严重地破坏那些地区人民的生活和生产。西藏人民必须继续积极协助人民解放军彻底肃清这些地区的残余匪徒，维护社会治安，巩固祖国国防。（热烈的经久不息的掌声）
    逐步进行改革，走民主和社会主义的道路，这是我们西藏人民繁荣幸福的唯一的康庄大道。（热烈鼓掌）西藏的旧制度，残酷地压迫着广大的劳动人民，如果不加改革，西藏地区贫困落后的面貌就不能改变。这犹如不经慈航，就无法脱离苦海，走上幸福的极乐世界。西藏的人民早已积极要求改革，很大一部分上层人士为了西藏的发展前途，也赞成进行改革。西藏自治区筹备委员会应当通过同各阶层爱国人士的协商，逐步实现改革的任务，努力建设民主的进步的新西藏。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    加强汉族藏族以及各民族人民的团结，是西藏人民进步和发展的根本保证。（鼓掌）如果没有汉族的帮助，西藏地区的安全和发展是不可设想的。西藏人民必须象尊重三宝（按：三宝是指佛、法、僧）一样地来尊重汉藏人民的友谊，并且不断地巩固和发展这个友谊。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    最后，我衷心地希望达赖喇嘛能够摆脱被劫持的处境，回到祖国的怀抱来，同西藏人民一道，共同建设光明幸福的新西藏。（热烈的经久不息的掌声）
    让我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！（鼓掌）
    中国各民族大团结万岁！（鼓掌）
    在祖国大家庭中走向繁荣幸福的新西藏万岁！（热烈鼓掌）
    中国共产党万岁！（热烈鼓掌）
    各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）（按：标题和小插题是编者加的）
