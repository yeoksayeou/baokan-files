We fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, several Vice-Premiers, and Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen, and we guarantee to bring the spirit of this conference back and strive to implement it.

We are workers from Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. Now, we will report to the conference on the great leap forward situation of the broad masses of workers at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, who are vigorously engaging in technical revolution and using local iron to produce good steel.

In 1958, the workers of our Chongqing Iron and Steel Company greatly enhanced their class consciousness through rectification. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, we broke down superstitions, liberated our minds, and charged wherever the Party pointed us. We rushed to wherever the difficulties were greatest. It is precisely because of the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao that our company, like our comrades on the national iron and steel front, achieved unprecedented harvests in both ideology and production last year. After implementing the "two participations, three combinations" system, the relationship between cadres and the masses improved. Everyone established a communist attitude towards labor, working for everyone and everyone working for me, not counting rewards, and not setting conditions. The communist style of daring to think, dare to act, and daring to create was unprecedentedly high among the workers. All workers contributed over 400,000 ingenious ideas, many of which were major technical innovations and creations, such as "double-notch double-ladle steel tapping," "two-step charging," and "mixed steelmaking" in steelmaking production, as well as the modification of open-hearth furnaces, which increased the average furnace output of open-hearth furnaces originally designed for 50 tons to about 140 tons. In steel rolling production, there were "rhythmic rolling," "three-layer steel heating," and "quick roll changing." In iron smelting production, there was "enlarged tuyere," which increased the daily output of blast furnaces from 100 tons to over 200 tons. In refractory material production, there was "rapid kiln firing," which broke through the original heating curve and established a new kiln heating curve, reducing the firing time of clay bricks from over 60 hours per kiln to less than 6 hours per kiln. The combination of mass hard work and clever work resulted in an unprecedented great leap forward in production. Therefore, in 1958, we completed the state plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. Compared with 1957, the output of various major products increased significantly, with steel increasing by 48.9%, steel materials increasing by 30.5%, and refractory materials increasing by 120%. We also trial-produced and expanded 112 new products, including more advanced new technological achievements such as copper-bearing heavy rails, high-silicon heavy rails, magnesia-olivine bricks, and high-strength blast furnace bricks. Our achievements are only resented by the imperialists. They say that we are living a "slave life." I say that this is simply nonsense. We, the working people, lived a slave life in the old society. Take me, for example. In the old society, I couldn’t get enough to eat or wear, and I had to be beaten and humiliated. That was living a slave life. Now that we have our great Party and Chairman Mao, our political status has been greatly improved. We participate in the highest organs of state power and discuss major national affairs. Is this still living a slave life? We say that no matter how the imperialists attack us, they will ultimately fail to achieve their goals.

This year is the decisive year for our country's three years of hard work. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has put forward a more ambitious goal for the people of the whole country. The glorious task of the national steelworkers is to produce 18 million tons of steel. The entire staff and workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have warmly responded to this battle call of the Party Central Committee and launched a technical revolution movement aimed at high production and high quality, with the main content being the refining of good steel from local iron. Last year, we used local iron to produce over 300,000 tons of steel, which was rolled into steel products to support national construction. One of the main problems we face this year is to turn more local iron into good steel. This is technically difficult. In the past, experienced comrades told us that it is very difficult to produce good steel if the desulfurization rate of open-hearth furnaces is above 50%. However, the local iron in Sichuan generally has a sulfur content of over 0.2% due to the high sulfur content of iron ore and coke. Whether we can technically solve the desulfurization problem directly affects the great leap forward in steel production and quality. To solve this key issue, we must first remove ideological obstacles. The Party Secretary used Chairman Mao's teaching that "strategically, we should despise difficulties, but tactically, we should pay attention to difficulties" to educate us, liberate everyone's minds, and boost everyone's enthusiasm. Everyone said that we must work in this direction, and difficulties cannot scare us. We are proletarian fighters, and our hearts are only set on one thing: to produce 18 million tons of steel. Some old workers said: We not only share the same heart and life with the Party, but we also share the same heart and life with steel. Because steel is one of the main forces in building and defending the motherland. The workers also circulated two poems like this: "Sulfur, sulfur, don't be rampant, you are a white-browed tiger, I am Wu Song." "Steelworkers are determined, they fear neither heaven nor earth, even the Jade Emperor and the Dragon King are led away, what is a little sulfur?" to express the workers' heroic spirit.

At the same time, the Party Secretary and other leaders organized engineers and technicians to go to the workshops to participate in labor with us, fighting hard at the furnace side day and night, holding furnace-side on-site meetings, and conducting desulfurization experiments. The Party Committee called on all workers to complete the task of eliminating sulfur and improving the quality of steel as a political task and clearly put forward: one goal, striving for high production and high quality; one central key, desulfurization; one basic method, two participations and three combinations. All the workers responded to this call from the Party Committee, and no one was willing to take a vacation during the Spring Festival. Leading cadres, engineers, technicians, and our workers worked together. As a result, both converters and open-hearth furnaces produced good steel from local iron with varying sulfur contents. The Party Committee promptly convened a desulfurization decisive battle competition, where workers in all links of iron smelting and steelmaking set up competition platforms. If there was no soda for desulfurization, lime was used instead. Using lime for desulfurization, the initial desulfurization rate could only reach about 20%. After the competition, everyone came up with ingenious ideas and methods, catching up with each other. Finally, the desulfurization operation method of the iron smelting furnace created by the workers ensured a desulfurization rate of over 60%. Later, the workers created the desulfurization operation method of the converter, ensuring a desulfurization rate of over 50%. They respectively won the championships in the iron smelting furnace and converter desulfurization battles. The Party Committee further concentrated the various desulfurization operation methods created by the masses in the competition and summarized the "one-dragon" sulfur elimination experience. This experience is: (1) Strengthen material yard management, stack by grade, batch into the furnace, and control the sulfur content of pig iron; (2) Use alkaline hot-blast iron smelting furnace; (3) Implement desulfurization outside the iron smelting furnace, mainly the desulfurization stirring should be deep and thorough, and the slag should be removed carefully; (4) Improve the four "three" experiences of converter desulfurization operation, namely: three fasts - fast iron tapping, fast slag removal, and fast blowing; three accurates - accurate slagging, accurate blowing angle, and accurate timing and quantity of deoxidizer addition; three highs - high molten iron temperature, high slag basicity, and high iron oxide content; and three coordinations - good coordination between iron smelting furnace and converter, good coordination between testing and smelting, and good coordination between furnace front and casting, etc. The four parts are closely connected and coordinated. Now, using this relatively complete desulfurization operation experience created by "two participations and three combinations," although the degree of mechanization is not high, and operations such as stirring and slag removal are still labor-intensive, requiring us to make further efforts to improve, under normal circumstances, we can produce good steel by proportioning local iron with a sulfur content of 0.4% to 0.5%. This fact not only guarantees the great leap forward in steel production and quality this year, but also opens up new avenues for high-sulfur pig iron steelmaking technology.

Dear delegates, this conference has adopted this year's national economic plan. This grand plan further encourages us to move forward. After we go back, we are determined to work with our comrades at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to always maintain the soaring revolutionary spirit of continuous revolution, overcome all difficulties, complete the plan assigned to us by the state ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, and guarantee the victorious and early realization of the 18 million tons of steel task, so as to accelerate our great socialist construction cause and defend the security of the motherland.

    攻破脱硫关　土铁出好钢
    黄荣昌张文金代表关于重庆钢铁公司技术革命的联合发言
    我们完全同意周总理及几位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，并保证把大会的精神带回去，努力贯彻执行。
    我们是重庆钢铁公司的工人，现在我们把重钢广大职工大闹技术革命，用土铁炼好钢的大跃进情况，向大会作一汇报。
    一九五八年我们重庆钢铁公司的职工经过整风，大大的提高了阶级觉悟，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，破除迷信，解放思想，党指向那里，我们就冲向那里，那里最困难，我们就奔向那里去。正是由于党和毛主席的正确领导，去年我们公司也和全国钢铁战线上的同志们一样，在思想上和生产上都获得了空前的丰收。我们在推行了“两参三结合”后，干群关系改善了，大家都树立了人人为我，我为人人，不计报酬，不讲条件的共产主义的劳动态度，职工敢想、敢做，敢于大胆创造的共产主义风格空前高涨。全体职工献出各种妙计四十多万条，其中有不少是技术上的重大革新和创造，如炼钢生产上的“双槽双包出钢”、“两步装料”、“混合炼钢”及改大平炉，使原设计能力五十吨的平炉，平均炉产量达到一百四十吨左右；轧钢生产上的“节奏轧钢”、“三层烘钢”、“快速换辊”；炼铁生产上的“改大风口”，使原来日产一百吨的高炉，提高到日产二百多吨；耐火材料生产上的“快速烧窑”，突破原升温曲线，建立了新的烧窑升温曲线，使粘土砖的烧成时间由原来的每窑六十多小时缩短到每窑六小时以下。群众苦干与巧干结合，在生产方面出现了空前的大跃进局面，因此一九五八年提前超额完成了国家计划。各种主要产品和一九五七年比较，钢增长百分之四十八点九，钢材增长百分之三十点五，耐火材料增长百分之一百二十，试制和扩大了一百一十二种新产品，其中如含铜重轨、高矽重轨、镁橄揽砖和高强度高炉砖等，都是比较先进的新技术成果。我们的成就只有帝国主义才不甘心，他们说我们过的“奴隶生活”，我说这简直是胡说八道，我们劳动人民在旧社会才是过的奴隶生活，就拿我来说吧，在旧社会里吃不饱穿不暖，还要挨打受气，那才是过的奴隶生活。现在有了我们伟大的党和毛主席，我们政治地位大大提高了，我们参加国家最高权力机关，讨论国家的大事，难道这还是过的奴隶生活吗？我们说不管帝国主义怎样攻击，终究是达不到他们的目的的。
    今年是我国苦战三年具有决定意义的一年。党的八届六中全会已经向全国人民提出了一个更加宏伟的奋斗目标，全国钢铁工人的光荣任务是拿下一千八百万吨钢。我们重钢全体职工热烈地响应了党中央的这一战斗号召，今年一开始就开展了一个以高产优质为目标，以土铁炼好钢为主要内容的技术革命运动。去年我们用土铁炼出了三十几万吨钢，轧成钢材，支援了国家建设。今年我们面临的主要问题之一，是要把更多的土铁变成好钢。这在技术上是有困难的。过去有经验的同志告诉我们，平炉脱硫百分之五十以上出好钢是很困难的，可是我们四川的土铁由于铁矿石和焦炭含硫较高，一般土铁含硫量都在百分之零点二以上，我们能不能从技术上解决脱硫问题，直接影响着钢的产量和质量的跃进。要解决这个关键，首先必须解除思想上的障碍，党委书记用毛主席“在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难”的道理来教育我们，解放了大家的思想，鼓起了大家的干劲，大家表示一定照这个方向去干，困难吓不倒我们。我们是无产阶级的战士，我们的心只有一条，这就是要把一千八百万吨钢拿下来。有的老工人说：我们不但和党一条心，一条命，而且还要和钢一条心，一条命。因为钢是建设祖国、保卫祖国的主要力量之一。工人中还流传着这样两首诗歌：“硫磺硫磺，你别猖狂，你是白额虎，我是武二郎。”“炼钢工人决心大，天不怕来地不怕，玉皇龙王牵起走，小小硫磺算个啥”，来表达工人这种豪迈的冲天干劲。
    与此同时，党委书记又和其他领导人一起，组织工程技术人员下车间和我们一起参加劳动，日日夜夜和我们一道在炉边苦战，开炉边现场会，搞脱硫试验。党委号召全体职工把歼灭硫磺和提高钢的质量作为政治任务来完成，并明确提出：一个目标，争取高产优质；一个中心关键，脱硫；一个基本方法，两参三结合。全体职工响应了党委这个号召，在春节期中没有一个人愿意休假，领导干部、工程技术人员和我们工人一起干，结果，转炉和平炉都用各种不同含硫量的土铁炼出了好钢。党委及时召开了攻硫决战比武大会，在会上化铁、炼钢各个环节的工人们都摆下擂台。脱硫没有苏打，就用石灰来代替。用石灰脱硫，开始脱硫率只能达到百分之二十左右，经过打擂比武，人人想妙计，个个想办法，你追我赶，最后工人们创造的化铁炉脱硫操作法，保证脱硫率在百分之六十以上，后来工人们又创造了转炉脱硫操作法，保证脱硫率在百分之五十以上，他们分别夺得了化铁炉和转炉脱硫战的擂主。党委更集中了群众在打擂比武竞赛运动中创造的各种脱硫操作方法，总结出“一条龙”的攻硫经验，这个经验是：（1）加强料场管理，分级堆放，配比入炉，控制生铁含硫量；（2）采用碱性热风化铁炉；（3）施行化铁炉外脱硫，主要是脱硫搅拌要深透，轻推慢扒除尽渣；（4）改进转炉脱硫操作的四“三”经验，即：三快——进铁水快，扒渣快，吹炼快；三准——配渣料准，吹炼角度准，加脱氧剂时间数量准；三高——铁水温度高，渣料碱度高，氧化铁成分高；三配合——化铁炉与转炉配合好，化验与冶炼配合好，炉前与浇铸配合好等四部分前后衔接紧密配合。现在运用这套“两参三结合”创造出来的比较完整的脱硫操作经验，虽然机械化程度还不高，搅拌、扒渣等操作劳动强度还比较大，需要我们更进一步努力改进，但在一般情况下，配比到含硫量百分之零点四至零点五的土铁，我们就能炼出好钢。这一事实不但保证了我们今年炼钢产量、质量的大跃进，同时也为高硫生铁炼钢技术开辟了新的途径。
    代表同志们，这次会议通过了今年的国民经济计划，这个宏伟的计划，更加鼓舞着我们前进，我们回去后决心和我们重庆钢铁公司的工人同志一起，永远保持不断革命的冲天的革命干劲，克服一切困难，提前超额完成国家交给我们的计划，保证一千八百万吨钢的任务胜利的提前实现，来加快我们伟大的社会主义建设事业，保卫祖国的安全。
