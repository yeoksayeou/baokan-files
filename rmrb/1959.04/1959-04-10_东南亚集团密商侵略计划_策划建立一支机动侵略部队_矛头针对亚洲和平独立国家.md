Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, 9th dispatch: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Council meeting continued its secret sessions today. Information revealed by Western news agencies indicates that ministers from the member states of this aggressive bloc have been focusing on plotting new invasion and subversion activities against Asian countries in the secret meetings that began yesterday afternoon. It is reported that in the substantive discussions of the past two days, this American-controlled aggressive bloc has discussed a plot to establish a mobile invasion force and launch an invasion and military intervention in Laos.

It is announced that today's meeting mainly discussed the reports submitted by the military advisors of this aggressive bloc. The secret meetings yesterday and this afternoon also heard reports from representatives of the member states on the "situation in the treaty area" and a "confidential" report submitted by the secretary-general of this aggressive bloc, Pote Sarasin. Sources say that three "special proposals" put forward by three member states have been submitted for discussion at the meeting.

According to Western news agencies, the meeting, in discussing the "secret strategic plan" put forward by the military advisors, discussed the establishment of a mobile invasion force "in extreme detail." The military advisors "have studied the possible role and strategic necessity of this force quite carefully." According to "meeting sources," this invasion force, planned to be composed of officers and soldiers drawn from British, Australian, and New Zealand troops stationed in Malaya, will be "ready to act according to pre-prepared plans for various hypothetical situations," and will be used to "deal with" "disturbances" occurring in a certain country.

"Meeting sources" also revealed that during the discussion of this issue, the meeting regarded Laos, "close to Communist North Vietnam and Communist China," as "the biggest danger spot" and the "main 'hot war' zone." There are also reports that the military planners of this aggressive bloc have been "ordered to draft" a "blueprint" for further armed intervention in Laos's internal affairs.

News reports indicate that when the military advisors of this aggressive bloc were drafting the plan to establish this mobile invasion force, they also felt "political concern" about Cambodia's pursuit of a peaceful and neutral policy. In addition, they discussed so-called "military threats" faced by other Asian countries, such as Indonesia and Burma. This situation shows that the spearhead of the mobile invasion force planned to be established by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will also be widely aimed at peaceful and independent countries in the Asian region. However, according to "meeting sources," during the discussion of this issue, "some people are worried that the neutral countries in Asia may not agree with the establishment of such a force, and may accuse the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization of being ready to interfere in the internal affairs of countries not belonging to this treaty."

New Zealand Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Walter Nash revealed at a press conference held this evening that the ministers and military advisors of the member states of this aggressive bloc will jointly hold "informal talks" tomorrow morning to further discuss the reports submitted by the military advisors. As previously reported, the extremely broad military conspiracy to be discussed at this meeting also includes strengthening the ties between this aggressive bloc and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact Organization, establishing nuclear weapons and rocket bases in Southeast Asian countries, and other issues that exacerbate tensions in Asia and the world. According to Reuters, at the secret meeting on the afternoon of the 8th, the three Asian member states of this aggressive bloc, Thailand, Pakistan, and the Philippines, "did not have the opportunity" to raise the issue of demanding increased economic "aid" from Western member states. The news said that these three countries "unanimously demanded that their Western allies should make the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization primarily an aid organization." In the past year, the governments of these three countries have been "making every effort to reiterate their demands for specific assistance (to them) through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." It is said that their main reason is that "this clearly defined assistance will reduce the criticism of them from India, Indonesia, and Burma," and these neutral countries accuse the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization of being "purely a military alliance."

Reuters quoted official sources as saying that the "differences between these Asian member states and Western member states on the issue of economic assistance" are "a threat to the solidarity" of this meeting.

    东南亚集团密商侵略计划
    策划建立一支机动侵略部队
    矛头针对亚洲和平独立国家
    新华社9日讯　惠灵顿消息：东南亚条约组织理事会会议今天继续举行秘密会议。西方通讯社透露的情况表明，这个侵略集团各成员国的部长们在从昨天下午开始的秘密会议上，集中地策划了对亚洲国家进行新的侵略和颠复活动的阴谋。据透露，在这两天的实质性讨论中，这个由美国控制的侵略集团已经讨论了一项关于建立一支机动侵略部队，以及对老挝发动侵略和军事干涉的阴谋。
    据宣布，今天的会议主要讨论了这个侵略集团的军事顾问们提出的报告。昨天和今天下午的秘密会议还听取了各成员国代表关于“条约地区情况”和这个侵略集团的秘书长沙拉信提出的“机密”报告。有消息说，由三个成员国提出的三项“特别建议”已经提交会议讨论。
    据西方通讯社透露，会议在讨论军事顾问们提出的“秘密战略计划”过程中，曾经“极其详尽地”讨论了建立一支机动侵略部队的问题。军事顾问们“已经相当仔细地研究了这支部队的可能的作用和战略上的必要性”。据“会议人士”透露，这支计划从驻在马来亚的英国、澳大利亚和新西兰的军队中抽调的官兵组成的侵略部队，将“随时准备根据事先就各种假设情况拟订好的计划活动”，被用来“对付”在某个国家中发生的“骚乱”。
      “会议人士”还透露，会议在讨论这个问题时，把“靠近共产党北越和共产党中国”的老挝看成是
  “最大的危险地点”和“主要的‘热战’区”。还有消息说，这个侵略集团的军事策划人员已经“奉命草拟”一项进一步武装干涉老挝内政的
  “蓝图”。
    消息说，这个侵略集团的军事顾问们在拟订建立这支机动侵略部队的计划时，还对柬埔寨执行和平中立政策感到“政治上的忧虑”。此外，他们还讨论了亚洲其他国家，例如印度尼西亚和缅甸面临的所谓
  “军事威胁”。这种情况表明，东南亚条约组织计划建立的这支机动侵略部队的矛头，还将广泛指向亚洲地区的和平独立国家。但是，据“会议人士”说，在讨论这个问题时，“有人担心，亚洲的中立国家可能不会赞同建立这样一支部队，并且可能指责东南亚条约组织随时准备干涉不属于这个条约的国家的内政”。
    新西兰总理兼外交部长纳希在今天傍晚举行的记者招待会上透露，这个侵略集团各成员国的部长们和军事顾问们将在明天早晨联席举行“非正式会谈”，进一步讨论军事顾问们提出的报告。前已报道，这次会议将要讨论的极其广泛的军事阴谋，还包括加强这个侵略集团同北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约组织的联系、在东南亚国家建立核武器和火箭基地等加剧亚洲和世界紧张局势的问题。据路透社透露，在8日下午的秘密会议上，这个侵略集团中的泰国、巴基斯坦和菲律宾这三个亚洲成员国“还没有机会”提出关于要求西方成员国增加对它们的经济“援助”的问题。消息说，这三个国家“一致要求它们的西方盟国应该使东南亚条约组织主要是一个援助机构”。在过去一年里，这三个国家的政府曾经“竭力重申它们提出的通过东南亚条约组织（向它们）提供具体援助的要求”。据说，它们提出的主要理由是，“这种明确规定的援助将减少印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸对它们的批评”，而这些中立国家指责东南亚条约组织“完全是一个军事联盟”。
    路透社引官方人士的话说，这些亚洲成员国和西方成员国“在经济援助问题上的分歧”对这次会议的“团结一致是一个威胁”。
