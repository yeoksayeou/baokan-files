Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of CPPCC.

Now, please allow me to report to the conference on the simple situation of the coal industry in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Before liberation, there was no coal industry in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The highest annual output of coal produced by indigenous methods was only about 170,000 tons, averaging about 42 kilograms per person, which could not meet the minimum requirements of the people's lives for coal. However, Xinjiang's coal resources are very rich. The reactionary ruling class was not interested in these natural resources most related to the national economy. In addition to brutally oppressing and ruthlessly exploiting the ethnic minorities, they never cared about the people's lives, nor could they. For example, they did not pay attention to coal, a necessity for the people every day. For thousands of years, the rich coal resources have been buried underground, unattended, and no one knows how much coal reserves there are.

After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the coal industry in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region began to sprout. Two small mechanical coal mining shafts were built in the suburbs of Urumqi, the capital of the autonomous region, with an annual coal production capacity of 250,000 tons. In 1957, the construction of a new pair of shafts started, with a design capacity of 600,000 tons of coal per year. With the increase in industrial and residential coal consumption, coal production has also increased year by year. In 1957, the output of raw coal, including the output of small indigenous kilns, reached 1.23 million tons, which was 7.2 times the highest annual output before liberation.

In order to create conditions for the industrial development of the autonomous region, the Party has particularly strengthened the leadership of natural resource exploration in the autonomous region. According to the results of geological work in recent years, the predicted coal reserves in the autonomous region are 4.4 trillion tons, accounting for more than one-third of the predicted coal reserves in the country. If calculated based on China's planned production level of 380 million tons in 1959, it can be mined for more than 10,000 years.

In addition to its rich reserves, the coal resources in the autonomous region have the following characteristics:

First, wide distribution. From Xingxing Gorge in the east to the Soviet border in the west, along the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains for more than 1,500 kilometers, there are continuous coal deposits. There are coal deposits everywhere on the northern foothills of the Kunlun Mountains and the southern foothills of the Altai Mountains. Yemaquan Coalfield, bordering Hami Prefecture and Gansu Province, preliminary test data confirm that it is high-quality coking coal and lean coking coal. The estimated reserves are more than 300 million tons. The refined exploration reserves of the Sandaoling Coalfield in the same prefecture are 250 million tons. The development of these coalfields can not only meet the needs of industry and civilian coal in the eastern part of the autonomous region, but also can be transported and sold to western Qinghai and the Hexi Corridor area of Gansu Province.

Second, complete grades and excellent quality. The proven coal types include lean coal, coking coal, fat coal, gas coal, long-flame coal, and lignite. The ash content of most raw coal is less than 10%, and after washing, some can be reduced to less than 5%. The sulfur content is mostly around 0.5%. They can not only be refined into good metallurgical coke, but also are good raw materials for the chemical industry.

Third, many and thick coal seams. Many coalfields are composed of several coal seam groups. The coal seams are numerous and thick, and stable. Taking the Urumqi Coalfield as an example, there are 33 mineable coal seams with a total thickness of 100 to 160 meters.

Fourth, shallow burial. In most coalfields, the coal seams are exposed above the ground. Where there is a cover layer, the cover layer is not thick, and many are suitable for open-pit mining. According to existing design data, there are five places that can be mined immediately by open-pit methods, with a total design capacity of more than 18 million tons. This provides a reliable guarantee for saving pit wood and improving labor productivity.

From the natural conditions of the above-mentioned coal resources, the coal industry in the autonomous region has unlimited development prospects in China's socialist construction cause.

The unprecedented Great Leap Forward in 1958 also greatly promoted the coal industry in Xinjiang. Under the situation of taking steel as the key link and a comprehensive leap forward, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically went to the mountains to mine coal and make iron. The cumulative coal output by September last year was less than 900,000 tons, while after September, in just three months, it completed the leap forward task of 1958 with an unprecedented record of 3.6 million tons. Coal production increased by two times compared with 1957.

In terms of new well construction, the mines started construction last year have a design capacity of 3.12 million tons of coal per year, which is more than five times the capacity started during the first five-year plan. If it were not for the great leap forward in national industrial, agricultural production and construction in 1958, the victory of the nationwide rectification movement and the struggle against bourgeois right-wingers, and the wise and correct leadership of the Party, it would obviously be impossible for the coal industry in the autonomous region to develop so greatly as it did last year.

From a national perspective, China's coal output reached 270 million tons last year, far surpassing the United Kingdom. The fact that China's coal output exceeded that of the United Kingdom has great economic and political significance both domestically and internationally.

The unprecedented and great victories achieved in China's socialist construction in 1958 were not limited to the coal industry. The output of many major industrial products has doubled compared with 1957. The total output of grain and cotton has also doubled compared with the previous year. The lives of the Chinese people have been significantly improved. This once again demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of China's socialist system; and once again eloquently proved the unparalleled correctness of the Party Central Committee's general line for building socialism.

The guideline for the development of the national economy in 1959 proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is correct; the main indicators such as steel, coal, grain, and cotton are magnificent. The Seventh Plenary Session carefully considered the objective possibility of China's material and technical conditions and the subjective initiative of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, and adopted the draft national economic plan for 1959. This is an achievable, more magnificent, and greater leap forward plan. It excites the hearts of China's 600 million people and encourages the enthusiasm of China's 600 million people. The Chinese people have the confidence and determination to complete this great and glorious task assigned by the Party ahead of schedule and beyond the target.

As an engineering and technical personnel, a fighter on the coal industry front, I firmly guarantee to work hard, study hard, improve my political and ideological awareness, strengthen self-transformation, and contribute all my strength to complete the task of coal industry production and construction in the autonomous region in 1959 and to ensure the national coal target of 380 million tons!

### 新疆的煤炭工业  胡师童委员的发言

专栏：

    新疆的煤炭工业
    胡师童委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年度国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长关于人大常委会的工作报告和李维汉副主席关于政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    现在请允许我向大会汇报一下新疆维吾尔自治区煤炭工业方面的简单情况。
    新疆维吾尔自治区在解放前是没有什么煤炭工业的。土法生产的煤炭最高年产量仅十七万吨左右，每人平均约四十二公斤，满足不了人民生活对煤炭最低限度的要求。但是，新疆的煤炭资源却非常丰富。反动统治阶级对这些与国民经济最有关系的天然资源并不感兴趣。他们除了对少数民族进行残酷压迫和无情剥削外，从来不，也不可能关心人民的生活。例如象煤这种人民每天所必需的东西，都未能引起他们的注意。千百年来，使丰富的煤炭资源埋藏地下，无人过问，煤炭储量究竟有多少，无人知晓。
    解放后，在党和政府的正确领导下，新疆维吾尔自治区的煤炭工业开始有了萌芽。在自治区首府乌鲁木齐市郊建设了两处小型机械提煤的矿井，年产煤能力达二十五万吨。一九五七年开工建设新井一对，设计能力年产煤六十万吨。随着工业及人民生活用煤的增长，煤炭产量逐年也有所增加。一九五七年原煤生产量，包括小土窑的产量在内，达到了一百二十三万吨，为解放前最高年产量的七点二倍。
    为了给自治区的工业发展创造条件，党特别加强了自治区天然资源勘探工作的领导。根据几年来地质工作的成果，自治区的煤炭预测储量为四万四千亿吨，占全国煤炭预测储量三分之一以上。若以我国一九五九年计划生产水平三亿八千万吨计算，可供开采一万年以上。
    自治区的煤炭资源除了储量丰富外还有以下几个特点：
    一、分布广。东起星星峡，西至苏联边境，沿天山南北一千五百多公里，络续不断，昆仑山北麓、阿尔泰山南麓，到处都有煤藏。哈密专区和甘肃省接壤的地方，野马泉煤田，初步化验资料证实是质量优良的焦煤和瘦焦煤。估计储量在三亿吨以上。同一专区的三道岭煤田精查储量有两亿五千万吨。这些煤田的开发不仅可以满足自治区东部工业及民用煤的需要，而且可以运销到青海西部和甘肃省的河西走廊一带。
    二、牌号齐全，品质优良。已探明的煤种有瘦煤、焦煤、肥煤、气煤、长焰煤、褐煤。大部分原煤灰分含量小于百分之十，经过洗选有的可以降低到百分之五以下。硫分含量多数在百分之零点五左右。它们不仅能炼成很好的冶金焦炭，而且是很好的化学工业原料。
    三、煤层多而厚。很多煤田是由若干个煤层群组成的。煤层多而厚，而且稳定。以乌鲁木齐煤田为例，可采煤层三十三层，总厚度达一百至一百六十公尺。
    四、埋藏浅。大多数煤田中，煤层露出地面以外。有复盖层的地方，复盖层也不厚，许多是适宜于露天开采的。仅据现有设计资料，马上可以以露天方式开采的有五处，总设计能力在一千八百万吨以上。这对节省坑木，提高劳动生产率提供了可靠的保证。
    从上述煤炭资源的自然条件看来，自治区煤炭工业在我国社会主义建设事业中有不可限量的发展前途。
    一九五八年史无前例的大跃进，对新疆煤炭工业也起了巨大的推动作用。在以钢为纲，全面跃进的形势下，自治区各族人民热烈地响应了党中央和毛主席的号召，热火朝天地上山挖煤、炼铁。煤炭产量到去年九月累计还不到九十万吨，而九月以后，短短的三个月时间就以三百六十万吨的空前纪录，完成了一九五八年的产量跃进任务。煤炭产量比一九五七年增加了两倍。
    新井建设方面，去年开工建设的矿井，设计能力年产煤三百一十二万吨，为第一个五年计划期间开工能力的五倍多。若不是因为有一九五八年全国工、农业生产、建设大跃进，有全民整风运动和反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争的胜利，有党的英明的、正确的领导，自治区煤炭工业象去年那样大发展，显然是不可能的。
    从全国范围来看，去年我国煤炭产量达两亿七千万吨，已把英国远远地抛在后面。我国煤炭产量超过英国这一事实，无论从国内或国际来讲，都有着巨大的经济意义和政治意义。
    一九五八年我国社会主义建设所取得的空前的、伟大的胜利并不限于煤炭工业。许多主要工业产品产量较一九五七年都成倍地增长。粮食和棉花的总产量也比上年增加了一倍。我国人民生活得到了显著的改善。这又一次显示了我国社会主义社会制度的无比优越性；又一次雄辩地证明了党中央的建设社会主义总路线的无比正确性。
    党的八届六中全会提出的一九五九年国民经济发展的方针是正确的；钢、煤、粮、棉等主要指标是宏伟的。七中全会认真考虑了我国物质技术条件的客观可能性和人民群众革命干劲的主观能动性，通过了一九五九年国民经济计划草案。这是一个能够实现的，更加宏伟、更大跃进的计划。它振奋了我国六亿多人民的心弦，鼓舞了我国六亿多人民的干劲。我国人民有信心、有决心提前和超额完成党所交给的这一伟大而光荣的任务。
    作为一个工程技术人员，煤炭工业战线上的战士，我坚决保证努力工作，努力学习，提高政治思想觉悟，加强自我改造，为完成自治区一九五九年煤炭工业生产与建设任务，为确保全国三亿八千万吨的煤炭指标，贡献出我的全部力量！
