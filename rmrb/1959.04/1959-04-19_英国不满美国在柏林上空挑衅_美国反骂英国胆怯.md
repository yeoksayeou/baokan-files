Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 18th: The disagreement between the United States and Britain caused by the provocative action of American military aircraft flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the Berlin air corridor continues.

Yesterday, U.S. State Department spokesman White, at a press conference, insisted that this provocative action by the United States was to "defend" Western "rights" in Berlin. He described Britain's legitimate unease about the matter as "cowardice" and insisted that the United States "has the right" to fly at high altitudes over Berlin. He also said that "there is absolutely no upper limit to the flight altitude in the corridor." U.S. State Department officials, in explaining White's statement, also said that treating the defense of Western "rights" in Berlin as a provocation to the Soviet Union is "absurd."

U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy also clamored on the 16th that the United States would "continue high-altitude flights" in the Berlin air corridor.

The bourgeois press also repeated the official argument attacking Britain. The "New York Daily News" published an editorial yesterday titled "Mind Your Own Business." The paper said, "Ever since the Berlin dispute suddenly flared up, British politicians have turned into pitiful chicks."

However, British newspapers continue to condemn American provocative actions. The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" said in an editorial yesterday titled "Provocative Actions," "This provocative action can only be an intolerable act of stupidity."

British Broadcasting Corporation commentator Mayemins believes that this American action is intended to escalate international tensions on the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and the summit conference.

　　英国不满美国在柏林上空挑衅
　　美国反骂英国胆怯
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国军用飞机在通往柏林的空中走廊作一万英尺高空飞行，这种挑衅性行动在美英两国之间引起的分歧在继续着。
    美国国务院发言人怀特昨天在记者招待会上硬说美国的这种挑衅性行动是为了“维护”西方在柏林的“权利”，他把英国对这件事所表示的正当不安说成是“胆怯”，并且坚持美国“有权”在柏林高空飞行。他还说，“对走廊的飞行高度根本没有什么最高限制”。美国国务院的官员在解释怀特的声明时还说，把维护西方在柏林的“权利”当做对苏联的挑衅，“这是荒谬的”。
    美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊16日也叫嚷美国将在柏林空中走廊“继续进行高空飞行”。
    资产阶级报纸也重复官方的攻击英国的论调。“纽约每日新闻”昨天发表了一篇社论、题目叫做“管你们自己的事”。这家报纸说，“自从柏林争端突然炽烈以后，英国的政治家们已经变成了可怜的鸡雏儿。”
    但是，英国的报纸继续谴责美国的挑衅行动。自由党的“新闻纪事报”昨天在一篇题为“挑衅行动”的社论中说，“这种挑衅行动只能是一种不可容忍的愚蠢行为。”
    英国广播公司的评论员梅孟斯认为，美国的这种行动是想在日内瓦外长会议和高级会议的前夕加剧国际紧张局势。
