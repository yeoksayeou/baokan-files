Long Live the Friendship Between China and Hungary!
Nográdi Sándor, Ambassador of the Hungarian People's Republic to China, Member of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation

The friendly visit to China by the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation headed by Münnich Ferenc, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, is an important milestone in the friendship between China and Hungary. The delegation will hold talks with the outstanding leaders of the Chinese people, meet with the Chinese working people, and visit China's modern industrial enterprises and people's communes. The delegation will learn about the Great Leap Forward in China's industry, agriculture, technology, and culture, enrich their knowledge with the invaluable experience of this great country, and convey their observations in China to the Hungarian people in vivid reports, in order to inspire them to achieve greater success in socialist construction and to raise even higher in freedom-loving Hungary the banner of the universally applicable Marxist-Leninist thought.

Although we have only truly known each other for ten years, our friendship seems to have a history of thousands of years. What kind of ten years have these been? We all remember the day when the founding of the People's Republic of China was announced. Workers, working farmers, and outstanding intellectuals in Budapest and other industrial cities in Hungary were all elated upon hearing this good news. "The East is liberated!" "Long live the People's China!" The Hungarian working people cheered these slogans. In those days, ideals and aspirations of thousands of years flowed out of friendly and natural feelings. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country immediately recognized it with great enthusiasm, and diplomatic relations were established only three days later. Since then, the brotherly cooperation between our two countries has grown day by day, demonstrating that the friendship between our two countries is as solid as a rock and as constant as the sun and moon.

Let's look at the facts: In January 1955, China and Hungary signed a scientific and technological cooperation agreement. According to this agreement, experts and scientists from our two countries have held four meetings since then. Hungary has received great assistance from China, especially in rice production, crop seeds, silkworm eggs, and silk weaving. We have also provided some experience to China in irrigation, soil improvement, phosphate mining, artificial fertilizer production, and cable manufacturing. The work of the Hungarian geological survey team that has been working in China since 1956 has achieved certain results. The fourth meeting held under the scientific and technological agreement passed a resolution on the establishment of close cooperation between thirty-four research institutions on each side.

In terms of trade, the first trade agreement between China and Hungary was signed in 1951. Prior to this, there had already been trade between the two brotherly countries. After the signing of the agreement, trade continued to develop on a planned basis. This year, the main items Hungary exports to China are complete sets of equipment, such as steel pipe factories, power plants, as well as communication equipment and instruments, transportation vehicles, machine tools, and tractors. China exports various grains and machine tools to Hungary. The long-term trade agreement for 1959-1962 signed in Beijing in April 1958 is of great significance for determining and developing the annual trade volume. The growing scientific, technological, and economic cooperation between great China and Hungary is of great help to our country's socialist construction.

Cultural cooperation between China and Hungary is an indispensable factor in proletarian internationalism, the unshakable unity of the socialist camp, and the continuous consolidation of the brotherly friendship between our two peoples.

The Sino-Hungarian Cultural Cooperation Agreement was signed in July 1951. The purpose of this agreement is to strengthen the friendship between the two peoples and to carry out close cooperation in the cultural field in order to further mutual understanding. Since then, this agreement, like other agreements and contracts between the two countries, has stood the test well. The Cultural Cooperation Agreement is implemented concretely through annual implementation plans, which grow and enrich year by year in quantity and content. The Hungarian people attach great importance to and fully understand the long-standing Chinese culture, which is now full of socialist content, whether it is literature, painting, or drama. Seventy Chinese literary works have now been translated into Hungarian. This is something we could not have imagined in the past. We are very pleased that eighty Hungarian literary works have been translated into Chinese. The amazing performances of the Beijing Opera Troupe, the Puppet Theater Troupe, and the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, which visited and performed in Budapest, left an indelible impression on the Hungarian audience. And the wonderful Chinese painting exhibition held in Budapest last summer was admired by all visitors. The Hungarian Folk Art Troupe, the actors of the Budapest Opera House, and the small ballet troupe, which visited and performed in China, and the Hungarian painting exhibition held in China, were also warmly welcomed by the Chinese audience. Practice has proved that the mutual exchange of culture and art is of great significance for the people of the two countries to understand each other and love each other's culture and art.

The results of the close cooperation between the Academies of Sciences of China and Hungary are invaluable. Their cooperation has a history of several years. The Chinese scientific delegation headed by Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Hungarian scientists led by Rusznyák István, President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, have visited each other. The two sides also frequently sent scientists to visit individually, introducing their scientific research achievements in their academic reports. In May last year, representatives of the two sides signed a scientific cooperation agreement between the two Academies of Sciences.

Educational delegations from both sides have made two visits so far to exchange experiences. According to the Sino-Hungarian Cultural Cooperation Agreement, both sides have exchanged students and graduate students. This gratifying system is one of the basic factors of the brilliant prospect of friendship and brotherly cooperation between the two peoples. The exchange of journalists and youth delegations is also of extremely great significance. The Hungarian people welcome the establishment of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association in the autumn of last year with a sense of pride. The establishment of this association has further promoted cooperation between China and Hungary.

Life has proven that the establishment of personal connections between the leaders of the two brotherly parties and governments is of great significance. In January 1956, the entire Hungarian people welcomed Marshal Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, who came to visit our country from faraway China like a mythical brave general, with joy and excitement. In January 1957, just as the counter-revolutionary forces, who had suffered military defeats, were still struggling to hinder the Hungarian people from healing their wounds and restoring their economy and culture, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and other leading comrades visited our country. In those days, we still had to conduct armed struggles against the counter-revolutionary bandits hiding in some areas of our country. The Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou brought the Hungarian people the brotherly love, sympathy, and friendship of the great Chinese people at these critical moments, and gave our people valuable suggestions for their political and ideological struggles in the name of the Chinese Communist Party, which has rich experience in struggle. The Hungarian people realized that, in addition to the great Soviet Union, the great Chinese people and other socialist brotherly countries also supported our just struggle. This gave the Hungarian people great encouragement. That visit (the significance of which has been manifested in the Sino-Hungarian Joint Statement) left an indelible impression on the Hungarian people. This is very natural. On March 21 this year, on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Hungarian Soviet Republic, we had another opportunity to welcome the close friends and comrades of the Hungarian people, the Party and government delegation led by Zhu De, whose visit made our people, party, and government feel extremely honored. The visit of the Hungarian Party and government delegation headed by Comrade Kádár János to China in September and October 1957 was also of the same great significance. During their visit, they had the opportunity to understand the development of the Chinese revolution and had valuable talks with Comrade Mao Zedong and other Party and government leaders of China. The Party and government delegations dispatched by both sides reached a complete consensus on the international situation, world peace, the unity of the socialist camp, the international workers' movement, and the struggle against revisionism in the course of various talks.

In the current international situation, I think it should be particularly emphasized that we have a complete consensus on the urgent issues of foreign policy. We jointly support with our greatest strength all measures aimed at eliminating the "Cold War," consolidating peace, establishing collective security, and rationally resolving the German issue in line with the interests of the German people and the interests of international peace. We are completely united in the struggle against imperialism, in supporting the peoples of all countries who are fighting for their freedom, and in crushing the conspiracies of the United States and other imperialists and their actions of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The Chinese people gave our people full moral and economic support and assistance when imperialism carried out counter-revolutionary activities in Hungary in the autumn of 1956. This is a vivid manifestation of the solidarity of the people of China and Hungary.

The unbreakable friendship and indivisible unity between our two peoples is also manifested in: the Hungarian people fully support the Chinese people's just struggle against US imperialism's aggression in the Taiwan region.

The purpose of this visit of the Hungarian Party and government delegation to China is to further strengthen the friendship and brotherly cooperation between our two peoples. It will further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by our example—the Soviet Union, and make our two peoples closer.

Long live the great Chinese people!
Long live the eternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary!

    中匈两国友谊万岁！
    匈牙利人民共和国驻华大使匈牙利党政代表团团员  诺格拉第·山道尔
    以匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会政治局委员、工农革命政府总理明尼赫·费伦茨为首的匈牙利党政代表团来到中国进行友好访问，这是中匈两国友谊的重要里程碑。代表团将和中国人民的杰出领导者们进行会谈，将和中国劳动人民见面，并将参观中国的现代化工业企业和人民公社，代表团将了解中国工业、农业、技术和文化方面的大跃进，用这个伟大国家的不可估价的经验来丰富自己的知识，并将把他们在中国的见闻，用生动的报告转达给匈牙利人民，以便鼓舞他们在社会主义建设中获得更大的成就，在爱好自由的匈牙利更高地举起放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义思想的旗帜。
    虽然我们彼此真正的认识仅仅十年，可是我们的友谊好像有了数千年的历史。这十年是什么样的十年呢？我们都记得，中华人民共和国宣告成立的那一天，布达佩斯和匈牙利的其它工业城市的工人、劳动农民和优秀的知识分子听到这个喜讯，无不欢欣鼓舞。“东方解放了！”“人民中国万岁！”匈牙利劳动人民欢呼了这些口号。在那些日子里，千百年来的理想和愿望，从友好的、自然的感情里流露出来。中华人民共和国宣告成立之后，我国立刻以极大热情承认了它，并且仅仅过了三天，双方就建立了外交关系。从那时起，我们两国之间的兄弟合作日益发展，这说明我们两国的友谊坚如磐石、恒如日月。
    我们且看事实：1955年1月，中匈两国签订了科学技术合作协定。根据这个协定，从那时起，我们两国专家和科学家已经进行了四次会议。匈牙利从中国方面得到了很大的帮助，特别在大米生产、农作物种子、蚕子和丝织加工方面。我们对中国也提供了在灌溉、改良土壤、磷矿、人造肥料生产和电缆制造方面的一些经验。从1956年起就在中国工作的匈牙利地质测量组的工作已获得一定的成就。根据科学技术协定所举行的第四次会议，通过了关于双方各三十四个研究机构建立密切合作的决议。
    在贸易方面，中匈两国的第一个贸易协定签订于1951年。在此以前，两个兄弟国家之间已有贸易来往。在签订协定后，贸易在有计划的基础上继续发展。今年，匈牙利向中国输出的主要物品是全套设备，如钢管厂、发电站以及通讯设备和仪器、交通工具、机床和拖拉机等。中国对匈牙利输出的是各种谷物、机床等。1958年4月在北京签订的1959—1962年长期贸易协定，对每年的贸易额的确定和发展具有重大意义。伟大的中国和匈牙利日益发展的科学技术和经济合作对我国社会主义建设有很大的帮助。
    中匈两国的文化合作，是无产阶级国际主义、社会主义阵营不可动摇的团结和我们两国人民兄弟友谊不断巩固的不可缺少的因素。
    中匈文化合作协定签订于1951年7月。这个协定的目的是为了加强两国人民彼此的友谊，为了更进一步的互相了解而在文化方面进行紧密的合作。从那时以来，这个协定跟两国间其它方面的协定和合同一样，很好地经受了考验。文化合作协定通过每年的年度执行计划具体实施，在数量上和内容上一年比一年增长和丰富。匈牙利人民非常重视并充分了解悠久的、今天已充满着社会主义内容的中国文化，不管是文学、绘画还是戏剧。现在已有七十部中国文学作品译成匈牙利文。这是我们过去想像不到的。有八十部匈牙利文学作品已译成中文，这使我们非常高兴。曾在布达佩斯访问演出过的京剧团、木偶剧团、中国杂技团的惊人表演，给匈牙利观众留下了不可磨灭的印象。而在去年夏天在布达佩斯举行的美妙的中国国画展览，使参观者无不赞叹。曾在中国作访问演出的匈牙利民间艺术团、布达佩斯歌剧院的演员和小型芭蕾舞团，在中国举行的匈牙利绘画展览，受到中国观众同样的热烈欢迎。实践证明，文化艺术的互相交流，对两国人民彼此了解和喜爱对方的文化艺术有很大意义。
    中匈两国科学院紧密合作的成果是不可估价的。它们之间的合作已有几年的历史。以中国科学院院长郭沫若为首的中国科学代表团和匈牙利科学院院长鲁斯涅亚克·伊斯特万率领的匈牙利科学家们曾互相访问。双方也经常派遣科学家单独访问，在他们的学术报告里互相介绍了自己的科学研究成就。去年5月，双方代表签订了两国科学院科学合作协定。
    双方的教育代表团，为了进行经验交流，至今已作了两次访问。根据中匈文化合作协定，双方相互派遣了留学生和研究生。这个可喜的制度是两国人民友谊和兄弟合作的光辉远景的基本因素之一。互派记者和青年代表团也有极其重大意义。匈牙利人民以自豪的心情欢迎去年秋季成立的中匈友好协会。这个协会的成立，更进一步推动了中匈两国的合作。
    生活证明，两个兄弟党和政府领导者之间建立个人联系有极大的意义。1956年1月，匈牙利全体人民以欢欣鼓舞的心情欢迎从遥远的中国来我国访问的如神话中的勇将一般的中华人民共和国副主席朱德元帅。1957年1月，正当在军事上遭到失败的反革命势力还在继续挣扎阻挠匈牙利人民医治创伤和恢复经济文化的时候，中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志和其他领导同志访问了我国。在那些日子里，我们还不得不同在我国国内某些地区隐藏的反革命匪帮进行武装斗争。以周总理为首的中国代表团就是在这些严重的时刻给匈牙利人民带来了伟大中国人民的兄弟般的热爱、同情和友谊，并以具有丰富斗争经验的中国共产党的名义，给我国人民的政治和思想斗争以宝贵的建议。匈牙利人民认识到，除了伟大的苏联之外，伟大的中国人民和其他社会主义兄弟国家也支持我们的正义斗争。这给了匈牙利人民以巨大鼓舞。那一次的访问（它的意义已表现于匈中共同声明里）在匈牙利人民心目中留下了不可磨灭的印象。这是很自然的。今年3月21日，光荣的匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年时，我们又有机会在我国欢迎匈牙利人民的亲密的朋友和同志朱德所率领的党政代表团，他们的访问使我们的人民、党和政府感到莫大荣幸。1957年9、10月，以卡达尔·亚诺什同志为首的匈牙利党政代表团在中国的访问，也具有同样巨大意义。他们在访问过程中，有机会了解人民中国革命的发展，并跟毛泽东同志和中国其他党政领导同志进行了宝贵的会谈。双方所派遣的党政代表团，在各次会谈过程中，对国际局势、世界和平、社会主义阵营的团结、国际工人运动以及反修正主义的斗争等方面，取得完全一致的意见。
    在目前国际局势下，我想应该特别强调，我们在对外政策的迫切问题上，看法完全一致。我们以我们最大的力量，共同支持旨在消除
  “冷战”，巩固和平，建立集体安全，以及合理的、符合德国人民利益和国际和平利益的解决德国问题的一切措施。在反对帝国主义的斗争中，在支援为自己的自由而斗争的各国人民，以及在粉碎美国和其它帝国主义的阴谋和干涉他国内政的行动等问题上，我们是完全一致的。中国人民在1956年秋天帝国主义在匈牙利进行反革命活动时，给予我国人民以充分的道义上和经济上的支持和援助。这是中匈两国人民团结一致的鲜明表现。
    我们两国人民之间牢不可破的友谊和不可分割的团结同样表现于：匈牙利人民完全支持中国人民为反对美帝国主义在台湾地区的侵略而进行的正义斗争。
    这次匈牙利党政代表团来中国访问的目的，是更进一步加强我们两国人民的友谊和兄弟合作。它将更进一步加强以我们的榜样——苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，并使我们两国人民更加亲密。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    中匈两国人民的永恒友谊万岁！
