Chairman, fellow members:

　　I am entrusted by the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to present the work report of the Standing Committee.

　　Since the first session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held in December 1954, more than four years have passed. In the past four years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, this association and its local committees have been engaged in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, in the socialist revolution movement on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, in the cause of socialist construction, in implementing the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties, and in assisting democratic figures from all walks of life in self-reform, and have done a lot of work. This has played an important role in strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic figures across the country, mobilizing all positive factors to serve socialism. The main work of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is reported as follows:

　　I. Political Consultation. In the past four years, according to the needs of the development of the political situation in various periods, this association has conducted consultations on major issues concerning the country's political life and the united front. To name a few, in terms of socialist transformation, such as before and after the high tide of the three major transformations of capitalist industry and commerce, agriculture, and handicrafts, consultations were held on the guidelines and policies for adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors in industry and commerce, the implementation of fixed interest rates and property inventory valuation for joint public-private enterprises, the model regulations (draft) of agricultural production cooperatives, etc. Through consultations, a consensus was reached, and the above policies were assisted in publicizing and implementing by state organs. In order to correctly implement the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, consultations were held on issues related to intellectuals, a correct assessment was made of the role of intellectuals in socialist construction in our country, and the work of uniting and transforming them was strengthened, which was conducive to mobilizing and giving play to their active role. In February 1957, members of this association attended the Supreme State Conference, listened to and discussed Chairman Mao Zedong's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," which clarified the two types of contradictions with different natures and different handling policies. After the meeting, it was conveyed to the local committees, which played a significant guiding role in the work of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　In the summer of 1957, the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party of China, the state, and the people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, this association resolutely carried out the anti-rightist struggle, and assisted and promoted this struggle in various aspects. After the anti-rightist struggle achieved a complete victory, this association, based on the principles of Chairman Mao Zedong's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the spirit of strictness in struggle and leniency in handling, consulted on the handling of rightist elements, and handled the rightist elements among the members of this association. It was precisely because a combination of severity and leniency was adopted that the Standing Committee, when consulting on the list of members of this session, retained some rightist elements who expressed their willingness to repent as members. During the rectification campaign of the democratic parties, consultations were held on the rectification methods of this association and on further carrying out the rectification movement by the democratic parties, which promoted the further development of the rectification movement by the democratic parties.

　　Regarding the issue of issuing new Renminbi, the issue of issuing national economic construction bonds, the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967, the Second Five-Year Plan, and production and construction issues in industry, agriculture, and transportation, this association also conducted many consultations. Through these consultation meetings, state organs widely listened to opinions and suggestions from various aspects, and also communicated the policy ideas of people from various aspects, mobilizing their strength to actively participate in the construction cause.

　　In terms of ethnic issues, repeated consultations were held on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which enabled people from all walks of life to further understand the country's ethnic policy, recognize the important significance of consolidating national unity and the close unity of all ethnic groups, and criticize Han chauvinism and local nationalism.

　　In terms of overseas Chinese affairs, consultations were held on issues related to overseas Chinese affairs in socialist construction and socialist transformation.

　　In terms of international issues, we listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's report on his visit to eleven countries in Asia and Europe, and consulted on important issues such as China's participation in the Asian-African Conference, the signing of the Sino-German Friendship Treaty, supporting Egypt's resistance to aggression, and the Sino-Burmese border.

　　Regarding the handling of war criminals and counter-revolutionaries, consultations were held on the handling of Japanese war criminals and the handling of urban remnant counter-revolutionaries, and unanimously supported the government's policy. Regarding the issue of opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression and liberating Taiwan, our association held many consultation meetings, firmly supported the government's established policy, and strived for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

　　In addition, many important issues such as the Military Service Law, language reform, simplification of Chinese characters, and the Pinyin scheme were also consulted.

　　In November 1956, the Standing Committee decided to hold grand commemorative meetings in Beijing and major cities across the country for the 90th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of China's democratic revolution. In October 1958, together with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, a grand welcome event was held for the Chinese People's Volunteers returning from Korea.

　　During the Second National Committee, this association established eleven groups including international issues, industry and commerce, culture, education, science and technology, medicine and health, social welfare, women, overseas Chinese, ethnic groups, and religion. In addition to the participation of members, the work of the groups also absorbed people from various relevant fields. Carrying out the work of the groups has played a certain role in strengthening ties with various aspects, assisting state organs in publicizing policies, reflecting opinions and suggestions from various aspects, and conducting investigations and research and consultations on certain issues.

　　II. Assisting Democratic Figures from All Walks of Life in Self-Reform. In March 1956, after the high tide of the three major transformations, this association issued the "Decision on Organizing Political and Theoretical Study for Democratic Figures and Industrialists and Businessmen from All Walks of Life," and established the Socialist Academy. The provincial, municipal, and autonomous region committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference established political schools and short-term training classes for industrialists and businessmen according to this decision. In addition, this association also held study seminars. These studies have been remarkably successful, and most of the participants have made progress in politics and ideology to varying degrees. In order to help the democratic parties carry out rectification movements, report meetings and experience exchange meetings were organized on fundamental and common issues related to politics, economy, culture and education, ethnicity, and religion. Members of this association and other democratic figures were also organized to visit Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and other places to observe the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the people's commune movement.

　　With the changes in the situation of class struggle, the methods of this association in assisting democratic figures from all walks of life in self-reform are different. In the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the main methods were to adopt mass airing of views, big blooming, big-character posters, and big debates to conduct serious political and ideological criticism; in the situation where the frenzied attack of the rightists was crushed and the rectification movement came to an end, a gentle and subtle approach was adopted to conduct patient persuasion and positive education, and appropriate criticism and self-criticism were carried out, so that their self-reform achieved remarkable results. At the same time, in political and theoretical study, attention was paid to linking theory with practice, and social practice and labor training were appropriately combined.

　　III. In recent years, this association has organized CPPCC members and representatives of the National People's Congress to conduct inspections in various parts of the country. Some members of this association also inspected the work related to the united front and the work of the local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. After the inspection, not only were many useful opinions and suggestions put forward, which helped state organs improve their work and leadership style, but also enhanced our knowledge, experienced the lives and feelings of the working people, and contributed to self-reform.

　　IV. In terms of international activities, this association, together with the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, initiated a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons; together with The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a grand rally to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and a grand rally to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. This association also received foreign guests from thirty-two countries who visited our country, held welcome receptions, invited them to give speeches, or held discussions with them. Through these activities, the friendship with international friends was enhanced, and foreign guests also gained a better understanding of the situation of our country's people's democratic united front.

　　V. During the Second National Committee, a total of 908 local committees were established throughout the country. Among them, there were 28 committees in provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, 147 city committees, 33 league and autonomous prefecture committees, 643 county, autonomous county, banner, town, and mining area committees, and 57 district committees under cities. In recent years, local committees at all levels have played an important role in the local united front work. In order to strengthen ties with local committees at all levels, this association has established a local work committee. In recent years, this association has conducted inspections and investigations and research on the work of local committees at all levels, held professional meetings, and frequently introduced the work and experience of local committees of the Political Consultative Conference in the association's journal. This work will continue to be strengthened in the future.

　　Fellow members, in the past four years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the work of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has achieved great results. With the advancement of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the People's Political Consultative Conference still has its important role in the country's political life and the people's democratic united front. In the future, the People's Political Consultative Conference should strengthen the following aspects of work.

　　I. Continue to implement the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," strengthen the unity of the people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, promote the democratic parties and democratic figures to actively participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction cause, and strive together to build our country into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern Agriculture, and Modern science.

　　II. Strengthen political consultations, inspection work, and various political activities, strengthen ties with democratic figures from all walks of life, assist state organs in publicizing policies and laws, and reflect opinions and suggestions from various aspects to state organs.

　　III. Actively promote and assist democratic figures from all walks of life to conduct self-reform according to the six political criteria, strengthen socialist, internationalist, and patriotic education, strengthen the education of the general line of socialist construction, and help democratic figures from all walks of life to study Marxist-Leninist theory and the works of Chairman Mao Zedong on a voluntary basis.

　　IV. Promote democratic figures from all walks of life to continue to adhere to the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, and strive to defend national security, achieve national reunification, and liberate Taiwan.

　　V. Promote democratic figures from all walks of life to continue to consolidate and develop the close unity with socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, consolidate and develop friendship with all peace-loving countries and peoples, support the national liberation movements of all oppressed nations, strengthen international peace and friendship work, oppose imperialist aggression and war threats, and defend world lasting peace.

　　The above is the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is submitted to the congress for review. Now, the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is holding its first meeting and beginning its work. Let us wish it, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, to unite all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic figures to continue to carry out the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, make greater efforts, and make greater contributions.

　　中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告
　　李维汉
　　主席、各位委员：
    我受中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会的委托，提出常务委员会的工作报告。
    自从1954年12月中国人民政治协商会议举行了第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议以来，已经四年多了。四年多来，本会和各地方委员会，在中国共产党的领导下，在反对国内外敌人的斗争中，在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命运动中，在社会主义建设事业中，在贯彻执行中国共产党同各民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针和帮助各界民主人士进行自我改造中，做了许多工作。这对于加强全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其他爱国民主人士的团结，调动一切积极因素为社会主义服务，发挥了重要的作用。现将中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会的主要工作，报告如下：
    一、政治协商。四年多来，根据各个时期政治形势发展的需要，本会曾就国家政治生活和统一战线的重大问题进行了协商。举其要者，在社会主义改造方面，如在资本主义工商业、农业和手工业三大改造高潮前后，协商了关于调整工商业公私关系的方针政策，对于公私合营企业推行定息办法和财产清理估价的问题，农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）等，经过协商，取得了一致的认识，并且协助国家机关宣传和推行了上述政策。为了正确贯彻对于知识分子团结、教育、改造的政策，协商了有关知识分子的问题，对于我国知识分子在社会主义建设中的作用做了正确的估计，加强了对于他们的团结和改造工作，从而有利于调动和发挥他们的积极作用。1957年2月，本会委员列席了最高国务会议，听取和讨论了毛泽东主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，使大家明确了两类不同性质的矛盾和不同的处理方针，会后向各地方委员会进行了传达，这对于中国人民政治协商会议的工作，起了重大的指导作用。
    1957年夏季，资产阶级右派向中国共产党、向国家、向人民发动了猖狂进攻，本会在中国共产党领导下，坚决进行了反右派斗争，并且协助和推动各方面进行这一斗争。在反右派斗争得到彻底的胜利后，本会根据毛泽东主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”报告的原则和斗争从严、处理从宽的精神，协商了关于右派分子的处理问题，并且对本会委员中的右派分子进行了处理。正是由于采取了严肃和宽大相结合的方针，常务委员会在协商本届委员名单的时候，还保留了一部分表示愿意悔改的右派分子为委员。在民主党派整风期间，协商了本会的整风办法和关于各民主党派进一步开展整风运动等问题，推动了各民主党派进一步开展整风运动。
    关于发行新人民币问题，发行国家经济建设公债问题，1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要问题，第二个五年计划问题和工业、农业、交通运输业等方面的生产建设问题，本会也进行了多次协商。经过这些协商会议，使国家机关广泛地听取了各方面的意见和建议，同时也沟通了各方面人士的政策思想，动员他们的力量积极参加建设事业。
    在民族问题方面，曾就建立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区的问题进行了反复协商，使各界人士进一步认识了国家的民族政策，认识了巩固祖国统一和各民族亲密团结的重要意义，并且批判了大汉族主义和地方民族主义思想。
    在侨务工作方面，协商了有关社会主义建设和社会主义改造中的侨务工作问题等。
    在国际问题方面，听取了周恩来总理访问亚洲和欧洲十一国的报告，协商了关于我国参加亚非会议、签订中德友好条约、支援埃及反抗侵略、中缅边界等重要问题。
    在处理战争罪犯和反革命分子问题方面，协商了关于处理日本战争罪犯和处理城市残余反革命分子等问题，一致拥护政府的方针。对于反对美帝国主义侵略和解放我国台湾的问题，本会举行了多次协商会议，坚决拥护政府的既定国策，争取台湾的和平解放。
    此外，还协商了许多重要问题如兵役法、文字改革、汉字简化和拼音方案等。
    1956年11月常务委员会决定了在北京和全国各大城市分别举行了我国伟大的民主革命先行者孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念会，1958年10月和全国人民代表大会常务委员会共同举行了对于自朝鲜回国的中国人民志愿军的盛大的欢迎活动。
    第二届全国委员会期间，本会设了国际问题、工商、文化、教育、科学技术、医药卫生、社会福利、妇女、华侨、民族、宗教等十一个组。组的工作除委员参加外，并吸收了各有关方面的人士参加。开展组的活动，对于密切与各方面的联系，协助国家机关宣传政策，反映各方面的意见和建议，以及就某些问题进行调查研究和协商等方面都起了一定的作用。
    二、帮助各界民主人士进行自我改造。1956年3月，在三大改造高潮之后，本会发布了“关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定”，举办了社会主义学院。中国人民政治协商会议各省、市、自治区委员会根据这一决定，举办了政治学校和工商业者短期讲习班。此外，本会还举办了学习座谈会。这些学习是有显著成绩的，参加学习的大部分人员在政治上、思想上都有不同程度的进步。为了帮助各民主党派进行整风运动，组织了有关政治、经济、文化教育、民族、宗教等方面带有根本性和共同性问题的报告会和整风经验交流会，还组织了本会委员和其他民主人士到河北、河南、湖北、安徽等地参观工农业生产大跃进和人民公社运动。
    随着阶级斗争形势的变化，本会帮助各界民主人士进行自我改造的方法是有所不同的。在反右派斗争和整风运动中，主要是采取群众大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，严肃地进行政治思想批判；在右派的猖狂进攻被粉碎和整风运动告一段落的形势下，就采取和风细雨的方式，进行耐心说服的正面教育，适当地进行批评和自我批评，使他们的自我改造收到了显著的效果。同时在政治理论学习中，注意到联系实际，适当地结合社会实践和劳动锻炼。
    三、几年来，本会组织了政协委员会同全国人民代表大会的代表一起到全国各地进行视察。本会一部分委员还同时视察了有关统一战线工作和中国人民政治协商会议各地方委员会的工作。视察之后，不仅提出了许多有益的意见和建议，对于国家机关改进工作、改进领导作风都有帮助；同时，使我们增进了知识，体会劳动人民的生活和感情，有助于自我改造。
    四、在国际活动方面，本会曾经会同中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，发起反对使用原子武器的签名运动；会同中苏友好协会总会举行了庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年大会和庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年大会。本会还接待了来自三十二个国家访问我国的外宾，分别举行了欢迎会，邀请他们发表演说，或者同他们举行座谈。通过这些活动，增进了同国际友人的友谊，也使外宾对于我国人民民主统一战线的情况有了更多的了解。
    五、在第二届全国委员会期间，全国各地共设立了九百零八个地方委员会。其中省、自治区、直辖市委员会二十八个，市委员会一百四十七个，盟、自治州委员会三十三个，县、自治县、旗、镇、矿区委员会六百四十三个，市辖区委员会五十七个。几年来，各级地方委员会在地方统一战线工作中发挥了重要的作用。为了密切与各地方委员会的联系，本会设立了地方工作委员会。几年来，本会对各地方委员会的工作，进行过视察和调查研究，召开过专业会议，在本会会刊上也经常介绍政治协商会议各地方委员会的工作情况和经验。今后还要继续加强这一工作。
    各位委员，四年多来，中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会的工作，在中国共产党领导下，是取得了巨大成绩的。随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的前进，人民政治协商会议在国家政治生活和人民民主统一战线中仍有它的重要作用。今后人民政治协商会议应当加强以下几方面的工作。
    一、继续贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，在中国共产党领导下，加强人民民主统一战线的团结，推动各民主党派和民主人士积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，为把我国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而共同努力。
    二、加强政治协商、视察工作和各种政治活动，密切同各界民主人士的联系，协助国家机关宣传政策、法令，并且向国家机关反映各方面的意见和建议。
    三、积极推动和协助各界民主人士根据六条政治标准进行自我改造，加强社会主义、国际主义和爱国主义教育，加强社会主义建设总路线的教育，帮助各界民主人士在自愿的基础上学习马克思列宁主义理论，学习毛泽东主席的著作。
    四、推动各界民主人士继续坚持对国内外敌人的斗争，为保卫祖国安全、实现祖国统一、解放台湾而斗争。
    五、推动各界民主人士继续巩固和发展同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的亲密团结，巩固和发展同一切爱好和平的国家和人民的友谊，支持各被压迫民族的民族解放运动，加强国际和平友好工作，反对帝国主义的侵略行为和战争威胁，保卫世界持久和平。
    以上是中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告，提请大会审查。现在中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会召开它的第一次会议，开始它的工作，让我们预祝它在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下为团结全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其他爱国民主人士继续进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业，尽更大的努力，作出更大的贡献。
