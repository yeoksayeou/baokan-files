From a military perspective, the "military strength" of U.S. imperialism is the main thing it relies on in pushing its foreign aggression and expansion policy. Looking at the United States from a military point of view, we can not only clearly see the main source of the danger of war in the world today, but also clearly see that U.S. imperialism, although seemingly powerful, is essentially weak.

In recent years, the strategic thinking of Washington's aggressive war planners has undergone intense shocks. The once-noisy "massive retaliation" strategy has gone bankrupt, and now American generals and politicians are talking more about so-called "limited wars." This process of change, on the one hand, shows how stubbornly the U.S. ruling clique adheres to its war policy, and on the other hand, it shows even more clearly that the development of the balance of world power is very unfavorable to these war planners, and they have been forced to repeatedly revise their war plans.

U.S. imperialists have been actively preparing for a new world war since the end of World War II. In October 1951, the American monopoly capital's "Collier's" magazine published a special issue describing a hypothetical war of aggression against the Soviet Union. The cover was a Soviet map stamped with "occupation", with American occupation soldiers standing there holding rifles with fixed bayonets. The U.S. imperialists' set of arrogant dreams was propagated in this extremely shameless way. In January 1954, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles officially added a slogan to this fantasy: "Massive Retaliation."

However, not long after, especially after 1957, many bourgeois figures in the United States publicly pointed out that this "massive retaliation" strategy simply would not work and would only "invite failure."

These people came to this conclusion because the current balance of world power is very clear: the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. In fact, as early as after the Soviet Union, as the main force, defeated German and Japanese fascism in World War II, and after the Chinese people achieved a decisive victory against the reactionary rule supported by the United States, the anti-imperialist forces around the world had surpassed the imperialist war forces. The crushing defeat of the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield illustrated this point. However, the Washington rulers were unwilling to admit this a few years ago. They thought they had an "advantage" in "modern weapons" such as atomic weapons and strategic air force. However, the Soviet Union not only broke the U.S. monopoly on atomic weapons in 1949, but also became the first to produce hydrogen bombs in 1953. In 1955, the Soviet Union first successfully test-fired a medium-range missile, and in 1957, it successfully launched an intercontinental missile, and Earth satellites went into space one after another. At the beginning of this year, the Soviet cosmic rocket went straight into space. These caused bursts of great panic and frustration within the U.S. ruling circles. Although the authorities are trying their best to conceal the full truth about the United States lagging behind the Soviet Union in important scientific departments and military technology, even the U.S. Department of Defense has had to admit in its secret report to Congress that the United States lags behind the Soviet Union in most modern weapons.

There is a Western saying: "People who live in glass houses should not throw stones." With the development of weapons such as rockets, the world's strategic situation has undergone great changes. The era when the United States could hide in the strategic rear during the past two world wars is over. If the United States wants to provoke a new war, the U.S. mainland will be on the strategic front line and will be directly attacked. Some American bigwigs who were keen to throw atomic bombs at the Soviet Union to "occupy" the Soviet Union a few years ago are now shivering because of their own ideas. The best illustration is that the United States itself revealed last year that the U.S. Department of Defense has been assigning some "scientific institutions" for several years to study the U.S. "issue of surrender in a future nuclear war." Last year, the Rand Corporation, which conducted "research work" for the U.S. Air Force, published a book by Paul Kecskemeti entitled "Strategic Surrender," which argued that it was necessary to consider the issue of "surrender" in a "full-scale nuclear war." According to the "Washington Post", U.S. congressmen were dissatisfied with the Department of Defense's research on the issue of surrender, but they had "nothing to say" about the fact that the United States lagged behind the Soviet Union, which was the basis for the conclusion of the book "Strategic Surrender".

Recently, the Soviet Union proposed the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the peaceful settlement of the West Berlin issue. Some American generals and congressmen are again inciting war fever, clamoring that they will not hesitate to use "nuclear deterrent forces" against the Soviet Union in order to maintain West Germany and West Berlin as Western "cold war outposts." U.S. President Eisenhower is also repeating the blackmail of "not giving an inch." However, he admitted at a press conference on March 11 this year that, based on his experience in leading the U.S.-British Allied forces in Europe during World War II, the United States is now unable to "conduct a ground war" with the Soviet Union in Europe, as this would be "fighting in a position where we (the United States) are always at a disadvantage." Eisenhower also said that the United States would be "something that invites failure" to conduct a nuclear war.

With the bankruptcy of the "massive retaliation" strategy, since 1957, in the U.S. war preparedness plan, in addition to continuing to prepare for a world war in the long term, it has increasingly focused on preparing for so-called "local wars." Last year, the United States conducted "limited war experiments" twice in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait, and both times it was badly bruised. However, "limited war" is still a popular slogan in the United States today; this year, when senior U.S. military officials testified before Congress on military plans, almost all of them emphasized the preparation for "limited war."

The so-called "local" and "limited war" is deceptive. As shown by the past "limited war" adventures of the United States in Korea and last year in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait, the United States' aggressive ambitions are by no means "limited". It uses "limited war" to prepare for world war. Moreover, the U.S. authorities have repeatedly clamored to use nuclear weapons in future "limited wars," so the war itself will never be "limited" in scope.

The United States should have learned in Korea and last year in the Taiwan Strait that if the United States wants to wage a so-called "limited war" against any country in the socialist camp, it is to be an enemy of the entire socialist camp, and the United States must consider the serious consequences of provoking a world war. Recently, the United States has talked more about preparing for "limited wars" against the intermediate zones between the United States and the socialist camp, focusing on attempting to suppress the booming national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. However, socialist countries have stepped forward to support national independent countries at every critical moment, such as the U.S. and British armed aggression against the Middle East last year, which made it impossible for the United States to easily succeed in "limited wars" of bloody suppression in these regions.

Even from the perspective of the U.S.'s own military strength, it is not easy for it to launch a "limited war." The United States has extended its aggressive claws to all parts of the world, and it cannot but put itself in a strategic predicament: long front lines, dispersed forces, and inflexible operations. The United States currently has a total of 2.59 million armed forces in the Army, Navy, and Air Force, scattered over 250 military bases around the world. There are 200,000 in the Far East; 375,000 in Western Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East; 20,000 in Central America and the Caribbean; and 1.56 million in the United States (including Alaska), half of whom are still in training. If the United States wants to fight in Europe or Asia and Africa, it must cross the ocean. The United States is 6,000 kilometers away from Europe and more than 10,000 kilometers away from East Asia or West Asia. In the current non-combat situation, the United States has 396,000 armed forces on the transportation line. According to the situation during the Korean War and World War II, the ratio of frontline combat personnel to logistics personnel in the United States' bloated military structure would reach 1:9 to 1:11. Obviously, this aggressive deployment of the United States makes its military strength stretched everywhere. Last year, when the United States sent troops to Lebanon, it had to transfer troops from Western Europe, and when it provoked in the Taiwan Strait, it had to transfer troops from West Asia and the United States. The morale of the U.S. invading army is low. The American people are generally disgusted with and opposed to war, and in recent years, active servicemen have been asking to retire one after another. Last year, the U.S. military that invaded Lebanon had not really fought yet, and everyone was frightened. Eisenhower had to personally appease the military through radio, and American businessmen rushed to Beirut to make a big life insurance business. The United States forcibly occupies military bases everywhere in the world, which is tantamount to putting a noose around its neck everywhere. If the United States wants to carry out military provocations in one place, how can it prevent the people of other places from tightening the noose and making the United States beaten everywhere? This year, American congressmen also questioned military authorities in Congress whether they had the military strength to provoke in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait at the same time last year. Chief of Naval Operations Burke admitted that this was difficult to do. He said, "Our troops have become very thin due to dispersion," "We are indeed stretched very tight."

After the failures in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait last year, the U.S. war planning agency also "summed up the lessons." It seems that they are mainly carrying out "new adjustments" in three aspects: (1) Continue to vigorously develop missiles and nuclear weapons. The proposed budget for the 1960 fiscal year for research, production, and installation of missiles and other aspects totals nearly $7 billion (compared with $5.3 billion in the previous fiscal year), and the cost of developing nuclear weapons reaches $2.7 billion (compared with $2.6 billion in the previous fiscal year). (2) Strive to strengthen the mobility of the U.S. military. The U.S. Army has been reorganized into "five-unit atomic divisions." A "Strategic Army Corps" capable of rapid action has been established in the United States, ready to be transferred to other parts of the world to conduct wars. The U.S. defense agency is also being reorganized to be able to quickly enter "emergency events." (3) In strategic deployment, special emphasis should be placed on putting the troops of allied countries on the front line so that the United States itself can gradually "get out" and be in a more flexible position. The United States is stepping up arming West Germany and Japan to act as the backbone in the front line. On November 13 last year, U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy told reporters that the "lessons of Lebanon and the Taiwan Strait have made us tend to strengthen the policy of the United States" that the United States mainly provides naval and air forces and "strengthens the ground forces of allied countries." On December 4, Dulles said in a speech in San Francisco that when conducting "limited wars," U.S. allies should "provide 80% of the ground forces." Last year, there was some debate in the U.S. ruling circles about the U.S. overseas base issue. Some people advocated reducing some overseas bases in order to increase the "mobility" of the United States and reduce "friction" with the people of other countries. However, the ruling faction is actually continuing to increase overseas bases, especially missile bases, and publicly advocates a view that these overseas bases can "attract a considerable part" of nuclear counterattack forces in the event of a nuclear war provoked by the United States in the future, so that the nuclear counterattack forces will not all be concentrated on the U.S. mainland.

The United States wants to improve its "stretched tight" situation, to make other countries provide cannon fodder and serve as "targets" in future wars, which cannot but arouse a further upsurge in the movement of people of all countries against U.S. military bases and against U.S. aggression and war policies. The "new adjustment" in U.S. strategy is bound to deepen its contradictions with its allies. As the loopholes in the United States' own "military strength" become more and more obvious, the United States' control and influence over its allies are also weakening, and the imperialist camp is increasingly heading towards division and disintegration. The United States has always boasted that it has more than 40 "allies" with which it has treaties. However, when the United States provoked in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait last year, there were very few who really supported the United States, and the other dozens of "allies" all stood by with folded arms and cold words. Now, the United States feels that its own strength is weak, and it wants to rely more and more on its allies, but its allies are becoming increasingly unreliable.

Looking at the United States from a military point of view, we also need to see the relationship between arms expansion and war preparation and the economic foundation. A prominent phenomenon in recent years is that the U.S. practice of using arms expansion and war preparation to support economic "prosperity" is increasingly going against its wishes, and the contradiction between the arms race and economic development has been sharply exposed. In recent years, U.S. military expenditures have accounted for about 10% to 16% of the gross national product, and the total value of military orders is equivalent to 20% of the total industrial output value. The economic consequences of arms expansion can no longer be concealed. U.S. kept economists once boasted that the U.S. "strong economy" could maintain "high living prosperity" while scaling up military expansion. However, in 1957, the U.S. government ministers also publicly raised Hitler's slogan for the first time: "Less butter, more cannons," and the American people must make "major sacrifices." In fact, this is just a belated admission of the fact that it has consistently attacked the people's living standards. What really worries the U.S. rulers is that the government's huge expenditures have led to a budget deficit of as high as $12.9 billion in the 1959 fiscal year, and the national debt at the end of January this year has reached $285.8 billion, and it is expected to increase to $288 billion in June this year. Even U.S. President Eisenhower publicly admitted that the U.S. economy cannot support a larger-scale arms race. He said at a press conference on November 5 last year that "the United States cannot afford to fully equip armed forces with both missiles and conventional weapons at the same time," and that a substantial increase in military spending "will bankrupt the United States."

Of course, just like opium addicts smoking opium, the more terminally ill the economic body of U.S. monopoly capital is, the more it needs to expand its military "stimulus." The more profound the U.S. economic crisis is, the more eager it is to expand economically abroad and the more it needs "military strength" as its backing. The direct military expenditure in the proposed budget for the 1960 fiscal year reached $45.8 billion, maintaining the highest level in the United States during peacetime. From here, we can see clearly the root cause of the U.S. stubborn adherence to the policy of arms expansion and war preparation. However, although huge military expenditures can bring more profits to monopoly capital, it is clear that it will bring more economic disasters in the future, and the temporary "stimulation" it can play in the future will also be reduced day by day. The number of workers needed for the production of modern weapons such as missiles is limited, and the development of missiles will reduce conventional forces, which will increase the U.S. army of unemployed. The United States' continued frantic war preparation will accelerate the process of the U.S. economy rotting.

Under the current development of the world power balance in which the East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind, U.S. war planners will only encounter greater and greater obstacles in the future. Even some people in the U.S. ruling circles have begun to realize that provoking a new world war is a hopeless adventure for the United States, which will only accelerate the fundamental elimination of the imperialist system.

However, the U.S. authorities are still preparing for war in the long term and have not abandoned the attempt to fight a world war one day. At present, they are especially stepping up plans to launch "limited wars." In the United States, there is a group of war maniacs who, seeing that the development of the world's power balance will be even more unfavorable to them, are still advocating that a "preemptive war" must be launched against the Soviet Union within the next two years, because according to their calculations, if the United States wants to win a war against the Soviet Union by 1961, there will be absolutely no hope. People who love peace in all countries must not relax their vigilance against the possibility of war maniacs "jumping over the wall in desperation." The struggle against the aggressive war policy of U.S. imperialism and the maintenance of peace is still the primary task of peace-loving people all over the world.

    从军事上看美帝国主义的虚弱
    万光
    美帝国主义在推行对外侵略扩张政策中，主要指靠“军事实力”。从军事上看美国，不仅可以清楚地看到当前世界上战争危险的主要源泉，也可以清楚地看到美帝国主义虽然貌似强大，然而在实质上却是虚弱的。
    近几年来，华盛顿的侵略战争策划者的战略思想，经历了激烈的震荡。喧嚷一时的“大规模报复”战略破产了，现在美国将军和政客们更多地在谈论所谓“有限战争”。这个变化的过程，一方面显示出美国统治集团如何顽固地坚持战争政策，另一方面更显示出世界力量对比的发展对这批战争策划者是十分不利的，他们被迫一再修改他们的备战计划。
    美帝国主义者在第二次世界大战结束以后，便积极准备新的世界大战。1951年10月，美国垄断资本的“柯里尔”杂志出版过一期专门描写假想中的进攻苏联战争的特刊，封面上是打着“占领”印记的一幅苏联地图，端着上好刺刀的步枪的美国占领兵站在那里。美帝国主义者的一套狂妄梦想便是这般极其无耻地宣扬出来的。1954年1月，美国国务卿杜勒斯给这种狂想正式添加了一个口号：“大规模报复”。
    但是，曾几何时，特别到1957年以后，在美国国内也有不少资产阶级人士公开指出，这种
  “大规模报复”战略根本行不通了，只会“自招失败”。
    这些人得出这样的结论，是因为目前世界力量的对比已经十分明显，东风压倒西风。实际上，早在以苏联为主力在第二次世界大战中击溃德、日法西斯以后，在中国人民取得反对美国扶植的反动统治的决定性胜利以后，全世界反对帝国主义力量已经超过了帝国主义战争力量。在朝鲜战场较量中美国侵略者的惨败，说明了这一点。但是，华盛顿统治者几年前还是不愿意承认这点的，他们自以为他们在原子武器和战略空军等“现代化武器”上有着“优势”。然而，苏联不仅在1949年便打破了美国对原子武器的垄断地位，苏联在1953年又首先制成氢弹。1955年苏联首先试射成功中程导弹，1957年又发射成功洲际导弹，地球卫星接连上天。今年初，苏联宇宙火箭直上太空遨游。这些在美国统治集团内引起一阵又一阵的极大慌乱和沮丧。尽管官方还在竭力遮掩美国在重要科学部门和军事技术上落后的全部真相，但是甚至连美国国防部在给国会的秘密报告中也不得不承认，美国在绝大多数现代化武器方面都落后于苏联。
    西方有句俗语说：“住在玻璃房里的人，不要向外面投石头”。随着火箭等武器的发展，世界战略形势起了很大变化。美国在过去两次世界大战里能够躲居战略后方的时代结束了。如果美国要挑起新战争，美国本土就将处于战略第一线，直接遭到反击。有一些几年前还热衷于向苏联投原子弹来“占领”苏联的美国大人先生们，现在因为他们自己的这种主意而发抖起来了。最好的一个说明是，美国自己在去年透露出来，美国国防部几年来一直在指定一些
  “科学机构”研究美国“在未来核战争中投降的问题”。去年，替美国空军进行“研究工作”的兰德研究所出版了保罗·克奇克梅提写的一本书，书名“战略投降”，书中认为必须考虑在“全面核战争”中“投降”的问题。据“华盛顿邮报”的报道，美国国会议员们对国防部研究投降问题很感不满，但是对于“战略投降”一书作出这样结论所依据的美国落后于苏联的事实，大家“无话可说”。
    最近，苏联建议缔结对德和约、和平解决西柏林问题，美国有一些将军和议员们又在煽动战争热，叫嚷不惜对苏联使用“核威慑力量”，以保持西德和西柏林作为西方“冷战前哨”。美国总统艾森豪威尔也在重复“寸步不让”的讹诈，但是，他今年3月11日在记者招待会上承认，根据他在第二次世界大战率领美英盟军在欧洲作战的经验，美国现在是不能在欧洲同苏联“进行地面战争”的，这会是“进行我们（美国）始终处于不利地位的战斗”。艾森豪威尔还说，美国要进行一场核战争会是
  “一个自招失败的东西”。
    随着“大规模报复”战略的破产，1957年以后，在美国备战计划里，除了继续长期准备世界大战外，越来越着重在准备所谓“局部战争”。去年里，美国就在中东和台湾海峡地区两度进行“有限战争实验”，结果都碰得焦头烂额。然而，“有限战争”现在依然在美国是一个流行的口号；今年来，美国高级军事官员到国会就军事计划作证时，几乎没有一个不强调准备进行“有限战争”。
    所谓“局部”、“有限战争”，是带有欺骗性的。像美国过去在朝鲜，去年在中东和台湾海峡进行“有限战争”冒险所表明的，美国的侵略野心绝不是“有限”的，它是用“有限战争”来准备世界大战。而且，美国当局一再叫嚷要在今后“有限战争”中使用核武器，这样战争本身也绝不会是“有限”范围的。
    美国在朝鲜以及去年在台湾海峡应该已经领教到，美国要对社会主义阵营任何一个国家进行所谓“有限战争”，便是同整个社会主义阵营为敌，美国就必须考虑挑起世界大战的严重后果。近来，美国更多地谈论要准备对美国同社会主义阵营间的中间地带进行“有限战争”，着重在企图镇压亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲蓬勃高涨的民族独立运动。不过，社会主义国家在美英去年武装侵略中东等等每一个严重关头，都挺身出来支持民族独立国家，这使得美国要在这些地区进行血腥镇压的“有限战争”，也不会是轻易得逞的。
    即使从美国自己的兵力来看，它要发动“有限战争”也不是轻而易举的。美国把它的侵略魔掌伸到全世界各个地区，它便不能不使得它自己陷入战略部署上的窘境：战线漫长，兵力分散，运转不灵。美国目前陆、海、空三军共二百五十九万武装部队，分散在全世界二百五十个军事基地上。在远东有二十万；西欧、北非和中东有三十七万五千；在中美加勒比海地区有二万；美国国内（包括阿拉斯加）有一百五十六万，其中有一半还正在训练。美国要在欧洲或亚非地区作战，都必须度过大洋，美国距欧洲有六千公里，距东亚或西亚一万公里以上，在目前没有作战的情况下，美国就有三十九万六千武装部队放在运输线上，而根据在朝鲜战争和第二次世界大战时的情况，美国臃肿的军队结构在作战时前线作战人员和后勤人员的比例要达到一比九到一比十一。很明显，美国这种侵略部署使得它的兵力到处捉襟见肘。去年，美国出兵黎巴嫩时就要从西欧抽调军队，在台湾海峡挑衅时又要从西亚和美国国内调集军队。美国侵略军队的士气是低落的。美国人民普遍厌恶和反对战争，近年来现役军人纷纷要求退伍。去年侵略黎巴嫩的美军还没有真正打仗，便个个胆战心惊，艾森豪威尔不得不亲自通过广播安抚军心，美国商人赶赴贝鲁特大做人寿保险生意。美国在世界上到处强占军事基地，就是给自己到处套上绞索，美国要在一个地方进行军事挑衅，它又怎么能够防止其他地方人民不抽紧绞索，使美国处处挨打呢？今年，美国议员也在国会质询军事当局在去年有无兵力能够同时在中东和台湾海峡挑衅，海军作战参谋长伯克承认，这点很难做到，他说，“我们的兵力由于分散而变得很稀薄”，“我们的确绷得很紧”。
    经过去年在中东和台湾海峡失败后，美国战争策划机构也“总结教训”。看来，他们正主要在三方面进行“新调整”：（一）继续大力发展导弹和核武器。今年提出的1960财政年度预算里用于研究、生产、装置导弹等方面费用共近七十亿美元（上一财政年度是五十三亿美元），发展核武器费用达二十七亿美元（上一财政年度是二十六亿美元）。（二）竭力加强美国军队的机动性。美国陆军已经改编为
  “五单位原子师”。美国国内成立了一个能够迅速行动的“战略陆军兵团”，准备调到世界上其他地区去进行战争。美国国防机构也正在进行改组，以能迅速投入“紧急事件”。（三）在战略部署中，特别着重要把盟国军队放到第一线去，使美国自己能逐渐“脱身”，居于比较灵活的地位。美国加紧武装西德和日本，来充当头阵中的骨干。去年11月13日，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊对新闻记者说，黎巴嫩和台湾海峡的“教训使我们倾向于加强美国这样的政策”：美国主要提供海空军，而“加强盟国的地面部队”。12月4日，杜勒斯在旧金山演说里说，在进行“有限战争”时，美国的盟国要“提供80％的地面部队”。去年在美国统治集团里对美国海外基地问题有所争论，有些人主张为了增加美国的“机动性”和减少同其他国家人民的“磨擦”，减少一些海外基地，然而当权派实际上仍在继续增加海外基地，特别是导弹基地，并且公开鼓吹一种论调：这些海外基地在美国将来挑起核战争时可以“吸引相当一部分”核反击力量，而不使核反击力量都集中到美国本土上。
    美国想改善自己“绷得很紧”的局面，要这样使其他国家在未来战争中提供炮灰和充当“靶子”，这便不能不激起各国人民反对美国军事基地、反对美国侵略和战争政策运动的进一步高涨。美国战略上的“新调整”，势必加深它同盟国的矛盾。随着美国自己“军事实力”的破绽百出，美国对其盟国的控制和影响也日益削弱了，帝国主义阵营日益走向四分五裂。美国一向吹嘘同它缔约的“盟友”有四十多个，然而去年美国在中东和台湾海峡挑衅时，真正支持美国者寥寥无几，其他数十“盟国”个个袖手旁观，冷眼冷语。现在，美国感到自身力量虚弱，越加想依靠盟国，而它的盟国却日益更不可靠了。
    从军事上看美国，还需要看到扩军备战同经济基础的关系。近年来一个特出的现象是，美国用扩军备战来支撑经济“繁荣”的做法日益走到它的愿望的反面，军备竞赛同经济发展的矛盾尖锐地暴露出来了。近几年来，美国军事开支约占国民生产总值10％到16％左右，军事订货总值相当于工业生产总值的20％。扩军在经济上造成的恶果，已经掩饰不住了。美国御用经济学家曾经吹嘘过美国“强大的经济”能够在大规模扩军同时保持“高度生活繁荣”，然而在1957年，美国政府部长也第一次公开提出希特勒的口号来：“少些牛油，多些大炮”，美国人民必须作出“重大牺牲”。实际上，这不过是过迟地承认一贯向人民生活水平进攻的事实而已。美国统治者真正焦虑的是，政府的庞大开支使得1959财政年度预算赤字高达一百二十九亿美元，今年1月底国债已高达二千八百五十八亿美元，今年6月预计还将增到二千八百八十亿美元。连美国总统艾森豪威尔也公开承认，美国经济支撑不了更大规模的军备竞赛。他去年11月5日在记者招待会上说，
  “美国维持不起同时充分装备导弹和常规武器的武装部队”，军费再大量增加“将使美国破产”。
    当然，就像鸦片鬼吸鸦片一样，美国垄断资本的经济驱体越病入膏肓，越要扩军“刺激”。美国经济危机越深刻化，也越急于向外经济扩张，更加需要“军事实力”作为后盾。今年提出的1960财政年度预算里的直接军费开支达四百五十八亿美元，维持在美国和平时期的最高水平上。从这里可以看清楚，美国顽固坚持扩军备战政策的老根所在。不过，巨额军费开支固然能给垄断资本带来更多的利润，它今后会带来更多的经济灾难是明显的，它今后能起的暂时“刺激”作用也将日益减少。进行导弹等现代化武器生产所需的工人有限，而且发展导弹等会要减少常规部队，这些都将增加美国的失业大军。美国继续疯狂备战，将加速美国经济烂下去的过程。
    在当前东风继续压倒西风的世界力量对比发展下，美国的战争策划者今后是只会遇到越来越大的阻障的。连美国统治集团里，也已经有一些人开始认识到，挑起新世界大战对于美国说来是毫无希望的冒险，只会加速使得帝国主义制度根本消灭掉。
    但是，美国当局仍在长期备战，没有放弃有朝一日打起世界大战来的企图，目前特别在加紧策划发动“有限战争”。在美国，有着一批战争狂人，他们看到世界力量对比发展会对他们更加不利，还正在鼓吹必须在最近两年内对苏联发动“先发制人的战争”，因为据他们推算要是到1961年美国要想赢得对苏联的战争就绝对没有任何希望了。对于战争狂人“狗急跳墙”的可能性，各国爱好和平人民决不能放松警惕。反对美帝国主义的侵略战争政策和维护和平的斗争，依然是全世界爱好和平人民当前的头等任务。
