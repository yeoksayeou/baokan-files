Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, New Delhi Dispatch: Indian public opinion continues to discuss the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" not being written by the Dalai Lama himself. They also point out that the Dalai Lama has no reason not to personally publish a statement to the press.

    Indian News Service published a commentary on April 20th saying: "Some speculate that the Dalai Lama did not personally publish a statement to the press in Tezpur because he is sacred and cannot do so. It seems that this speculation is quite unreliable, because even when he lived a magnificent imperial life in Lhasa, he also received foreign journalists."

    The "Statesman" said in an editorial published on the 19th, "The striking impersonal tone of the statement issued to reporters in Tezpur (at least the English version of the statement is like this) would lead one to believe the claim that he is in a state of suppression - at least diplomatic suppression."

    The editorial said: "In writing this statement (which we don't think was written by the Dalai Lama himself), great attention was paid to the subtleties and nuances of the situation, but there was absolutely no spontaneity."

    印度“政治家报”指出
    所谓达赖声明表明达赖受压制
    新华社24日讯　新德里消息：印度舆论在继续谈论所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”并不是达赖喇嘛自己写的，它们还指出，达赖喇嘛没有理由不可以亲自向报界发表声明。
    印度新闻社4月20日发表评论说：“有人臆测，达赖喇嘛没有亲自在提斯浦尔向报界发表声明，那是因为他是神圣的，他不能这样做。看来，这种臆测相当靠不住，因为甚至他在拉萨过帝王一样显赫的生活的时候，他也接见外国记者。”
    “政治家报”在19日发表的社论中说，“在提斯浦尔向记者发表的声明的显著的非个人语气（至少声明的英文本是这样）会使人相信这种说法：他是处在受压制——至少是外交礼节上的压制——的情况中。”
    社论说：“在写这篇声明（我们认为这不是达赖喇嘛本人写的）的时候对情况的微妙和细微之处倒是非常注意到了，但是完全没有自发性。”
