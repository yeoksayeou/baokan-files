The conspiracy of Indian ambitious figures is bound to fail.
Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing said: The Chinese people will never allow anyone to lay a finger on any part of our sacred territory!

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now I would like to say a few words about China's cultural and artistic work.

The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production last year drove the great leap forward in cultural and artistic work. The facts are before everyone. In recent years, with the development of socialist economic construction, China's cultural and artistic undertakings have also made great progress. Especially last year, the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production drove the great leap forward in cultural and artistic work. The vigorous development of mass amateur cultural activities and the unprecedented prosperity of literary and artistic creation have created a new situation for the development of China's literature and art. In terms of literary and artistic creation, whether it is poetry, novels, opera, drama, music, fine arts, dance, etc., it is like a hundred flowers blooming, especially in reflecting the Great Leap Forward and revolutionary history, there have been great achievements. The rise of amateur literary and artistic creation by workers, peasants, and soldiers has opened up broad avenues and provided a solid foundation for the more universal and higher development of socialist literature and art in China. Film, publishing, art education, and cultural relics work have also achieved remarkable results. In 1958, China produced 103 feature films, more than one and a half times more than in 1957; 1,292 newsreels and science education films, twice as many as in 1957; the number of cinemas and film projection teams increased to 12,374, an increase of 24 percent over 1957. 1,884 kinds of newspapers were published, with a total circulation of 489.999 million copies; 818 kinds of magazines were published, with a circulation of 53.705 million copies; 46,018 kinds of books were published, with a total of 239.309 million copies. The number of museums and exhibition halls above the county level has increased to 900, and the number of public libraries above the county level has increased to 848. The number of higher cultural and art schools has increased to 35, and the number of secondary art schools to 138. The development of the above-mentioned cultural and artistic undertakings, compared with 1949, has generally increased by several times or even dozens of times. 1958 can be said to be a new peak in the development of China's cultural and artistic undertakings.

In the Great Leap Forward in 1958, cultural and artistic work conscientiously implemented the correct policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving politics, and serving production, as instructed by the Party. Cultural and artistic work, in coordination with various political and production movements, universally and deeply carried out socialist and communist education among the broad masses of the people, enhanced their ideological awareness, and inspired their enthusiasm for labor and revolutionary drive. Through the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, the political and ideological level of the broad masses of cultural and artistic workers has been further improved, and their work enthusiasm and initiative have been greatly brought into play. Many professional literary and art workers went to the countryside, factories, and companies to go deep into life, go deep into the masses, carry out socialist cultural popularization work, and actively participate in labor training to further transform and improve themselves, so as to achieve a double harvest in ideology and business. At the same time, due to the vigorous development of mass amateur cultural activities, over the past year, tens of thousands of amateur literary and artistic activists and backbones have emerged from the workers, peasants, soldiers, and students, which has greatly strengthened China's cultural and artistic ranks.

Make Cultural Work More Modestly and Practically
Our Culture Must Take Root in the Masses

As mentioned above, our cultural and artistic work, like our work in other areas, has achieved great success. However, our tasks in the future are very arduous, and our work still has many shortcomings. Therefore, we must not be complacent or relaxed in the slightest, but should do our work more modestly and practically. Cultural and artistic workers across the country should continue to work hard and strive to make better leaps forward in various tasks in 1959. This drive of ours must be combined with a high degree of scientific spirit and pragmatic spirit, so that cultural work becomes more and more meticulous and more and more practical. This leap forward of ours should first be manifested in our thinking, in the quality of our literary and artistic creations and the quality of our work. That is to say, on the one hand, we must continue to do cultural popularization work, and on the other hand, we must vigorously carry out improvement. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "Continue to mobilize all positive factors on the cultural and educational front, advance the cause of cultural revolution, popularize socialist culture, and continuously consolidate and improve on the basis of popularization, so that the development of cultural and educational work can adapt to the needs of the entire socialist construction, this is our task." I believe that cultural and artistic workers across the country will surely respond warmly to Premier Zhou's call and strive to complete this glorious task.

The culture we are creating and building is a socialist culture, and its task is not only to correctly reflect the socialist economy and politics, but also to effectively promote the socialist economy and politics. This culture is very different from capitalist and feudal cultures. It is a culture that truly belongs to the people, a culture for all, and it must take root in the masses. In a country like ours where culture is still backward, the people urgently need culture and scientific knowledge. They demand to master culture and become masters of culture. Therefore, we must do a good job in mass cultural work and carry out mass cultural movements. Without mass cultural movements and without the foundation of the broad masses, it is impossible to build a socialist culture. In order to develop mass culture and carry out mass cultural activities, we must also have correct work guidelines. First of all, our culture must serve the development of social productive forces. Culture must have the correct coordination with production. Culture must be conducive to production and must not be detrimental to production. Mass cultural activities must adhere to the principle of amateurism and must practice strict economy, resolutely prevent blind detachment from production and specialization, and oppose extravagance and waste. Secondly, the development of mass cultural work should be based on the needs, voluntariness, and practical possibilities of the masses. In order to meet the needs of the masses' cultural life, our writers and artists should write more and better literary and artistic works for the workers, peasants, and soldiers that they like to hear and see, perform the plays they like to watch, and sing the songs they like to listen to, so as to inspire and educate the masses with the spirit of socialism and communism. At the same time, we must also note that the spiritual needs of the masses are multifaceted, and our cultural and artistic work should meet the various needs of the masses as much as possible. In addition to giving them education and encouragement, we must also enable them to enjoy beneficial entertainment and improve their appreciation taste. Of course, doing this is not enough to rely solely on professional writers, artists, and professional cultural and artistic organizations. In order to meet the cultural needs of the broad masses, it is necessary to coordinate with the current central work and production tasks in various places, appropriately organize and carry out mass amateur cultural and artistic activities, and provide them with necessary help and guidance. Mass amateur cultural and artistic activities are activities for the masses to educate and entertain themselves. We cannot make any excessively high demands on them that are actually impossible to achieve. At the same time, the development of mass cultural and artistic activities must be voluntary and must not force them to do this or that, nor should we rigidly prescribe tasks for them. Chairman Mao wrote very clearly in his article "The United Front in Cultural Work" fifteen years ago. He said: "Our culture is the culture of the people, and cultural workers must have a high degree of enthusiasm to serve the people, must contact the masses, and must not be divorced from the masses. To contact the masses, we must follow the needs and voluntariness of the masses. ... Here are two principles: one is the actual needs of the masses, not the needs that we imagine in our minds; the other is the voluntariness of the masses, and the decision is made by the masses themselves, not by us on behalf of the masses." If we want to do a good job in mass cultural work, we must act in accordance with these instructions of Chairman Mao.

Strive to Improve the Quality of Literary and Artistic Creation
Fully Reflect Our Great Era

I would also like to say a few words about literary and artistic creation. Literary and artistic creation is the most important issue in all cultural and artistic work. Without creation, there would be no cultural and artistic work. Therefore, how to further develop and prosper literary and artistic creation is the most important issue at present. In order to promote the healthy development of China's literature and art, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" should be conscientiously implemented on the basis of serving socialism. Developing free debate among different schools and different views in science, and developing free competition among different forms and different styles in art, is the only correct policy to promote the development and prosperity of science and art in China. In literary and artistic creation, there must be strong leadership politically and ideologically, that is to say, there must be the leadership of Marxism-Leninism, and we must adhere to the direction of serving socialism and communism. This is our unwavering principle. However, in terms of artistic expression and style, as well as in the choice of themes, writers have complete freedom and are not subject to any restrictions; in these aspects, they can and should fully develop free competition. Our socialist cultural garden needs the "hundred flowers blooming" of all colors, not the cold and desolate one flower blooming alone.

Premier Zhou pointed out in his government work report, "We should encourage professional writers and artists to educate the people and meet the cultural needs of the people with works of higher ideological and artistic quality through arduous efforts." To achieve this, we believe that the most important issue is that literary and art workers should combine with the masses for a long time and strengthen their training in life practice. We cannot think that this problem has been completely solved, we can only say that the problem has just begun to be solved. Last year, a large number of literary and art workers went to the countryside and factories, which was a good start. In the future, we should pay more attention to truly enabling them to combine with the masses for a long time, truly establish a close connection with the masses like flesh and blood, truly take root in the masses, and breathe with the masses. Writers and artists must have rich life experience and struggle experience, this is one aspect; on the other hand, they must also have high political sensitivity, broad knowledge and rich imagination, as well as a certain level of literary and artistic accomplishment and expression, so that it is possible to create truly good works. Therefore, in addition to going deep into the masses, familiarizing themselves with life, strengthening training, and transforming their thinking, writers and artists must also humbly and diligently study and earnestly work hard on artistic expression skills. It is not right not to pay attention to skills. In the matter of learning, we must learn everything good and useful to our socialist cultural construction, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, and we must learn it seriously and in a planned way. Anything learned cannot be regarded as dogma, but must be combined with the current reality of our country, and used analytically and critically, so that it can be used as nourishment to enrich and improve our literary and artistic creation.

In recent years, China's professional literary and artistic writers and amateur authors have written many good works, which is very gratifying. But there are also some works whose ideological and artistic quality is not high. Therefore, we should pay attention to improving the quality of literary and artistic creation in the future. In order to help improve literary and artistic creation, we also need to greatly develop literary and artistic criticism and literary and artistic theory work. Recently, the literary and artistic circles have paid more attention to this aspect of work and have achieved some results, but from the perspective of the development requirements of the entire literary and artistic work, it is still far from enough. In order to encourage literary and artistic creation and help readers improve their ability to appreciate literature and art, we hope that literary and artistic critics will pay more attention to literary and artistic criticism work and introduce and recommend more good works. For those works that are not well written or have serious shortcomings, we also need to seriously and realistically criticize them, which is an education and help for both readers and authors. Literary and artistic workers should strengthen their theoretical study, and literary and artistic research institutions should greatly strengthen the systematic organization of materials and the research of literary and artistic theory. This is an important link in building socialist culture, and we must not ignore it.

Fellow representatives! What a great and glorious era we are in! How rich and colorful our lives are! The Party and the people demand that our literature and art can fully reflect this great era and better serve socialism. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, cultural and artistic workers of all nationalities across the country will surely be able to push literary and artistic creation and the entire cultural work to a more prosperous stage on the basis of past work, and be worthy of this great era.

We Adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and Do Not Allow Others to Interfere in Our Internal Affairs

Fellow representatives! Just as our great motherland is striding forward on the broad road of building a peaceful and happy new life, making brilliant achievements, a small handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata of Tibet, instigated and supported by imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, openly launched an armed rebellion, betrayed the motherland, and undermined unity. They vainly attempt to restore the aggressive forces of imperialism in Tibet and make Tibet forever a dark hell on earth. This heinous act of treason by the reactionary group in the upper strata of Tibet has aroused great indignation among the monks and lay people in Tibet and the people of China. Our People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, with the support of the people of the whole country, were ordered to quickly quell the rebellion in the Lhasa area and control the entire situation in Tibet. After the failure of the rebellion, this Tibetan reactionary treason group actually abducted the Dalai Lama and entered Indian territory. On April 18, in Tezpur, India, a so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" was distributed through Indian diplomatic officials. This is a document full of lies, self-contradictory, and absurd. The commentary by the Xinhua News Agency political reporter published in the People's Daily on the 21st of this month refuted this so-called "statement" with ironclad facts. In addition to fabricating all kinds of rumors and slanders against our motherland, the most important thing in this so-called "statement" is to talk about its so-called Tibetan independence. The people of China and the people of the world know very well that for hundreds of years, Tibet has always been Chinese territory. It has never been an independent country, and no country recognizes it as an independent country or establishes diplomatic relations with it. But now this so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama," which was distributed by Indian diplomatic officials and, according to a report by the British news agency Reuters, was "drafted after several lengthy meetings with Nehru's envoy Menon in Bomdila" (Reuters, New Delhi, April 18), and, according to a report by the French news agency Agence France-Presse, was approved by the "Indian government" and could "indirectly say some things" that the Indian government "found difficult to say directly" (Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, April 18), emphasizes from the beginning that "the Tibetans have always had a strong desire for independence," and the entire article is permeated with an attempt to mislead the people of the world (including the Indian people) by reversing black and white; according to this statement, it seems that the Dalai Lama is simply not a Chinese, and that his so-called "country" is really like an independent country. However, "Sima Zhao's intentions are known to all," and this so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" most fully exposes the ugly face of the expansionist who inherited the mantle of the old-line imperialism that the author of this document possesses. They seem to have forgotten that the Chinese people love peace, but are by no means weak and can be bullied. We are telling all imperialists and reactionaries that the Chinese people, who have already stood up, will never allow anyone to engage in conspiracies, infringe on our sovereignty, or allow anyone to lay a finger on any part of our sacred territory. The ambitions of ambitious figures are bound to fail! We maintain a compatriot's concern for the abducted Dalai Lama and look forward to his safe return to the embrace of the motherland. We sincerely hope to continue to develop and consolidate the close friendship between the Chinese people and the people of our great neighbor India. We insist on implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We never want to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and we will never allow others to interfere in our internal affairs. The cultural and artistic circles of China and the people of China, together, resolutely and enthusiastically support the various measures taken by our government on the Tibet issue. We firmly believe that the backward, dark, and cruel old Tibet will soon become a thing of the past, and the cloud drifting over the Himalayas will soon be blown away by the warm east wind, and the sun of the East will forever radiate its infinite light to the world.

    东风不久即将吹散飘在喜马拉雅山顶的一片乌云
    印度野心家的阴谋一定要落空
    文化部沈雁冰部长说：中国人民决不容许任何人染指我国任何部分的神圣领土！主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。现在我想就我国的文化艺术工作讲几句话。
    去年工农业生产的大跃进带动了文化艺术工作大跃进事实摆在大家面前，近几年来随着社会主义经济建设事业的发展，我国的文化艺术事业也有了很大的发展。特别在去年，工业农业生产的大跃进，带动了文化艺术工作的大跃进。群众业余文化活动的蓬勃开展和文学艺术创作的空前繁荣，为我国文学艺术的发展开创了新的局面。在文学艺术创作方面，无论是诗歌、小说、戏曲、话剧、音乐、美术、舞蹈等等，正如百花盛开，尤其在反映大跃进和革命史方面有很大的成就。工农兵群众业余文艺创作的勃兴，为我国社会主义的文学艺术的更普遍更高度的发展开辟了广阔的道路和提供了雄厚的基础。电影、出版、艺术教育和文物工作，也都取得了显著的成绩。一九五八年，我国摄制了艺术影片一百零三部，比一九五七年增加一倍半还多；新闻纪录片和科学教育片一千二百九十二本，比一九五七年增加两倍；电影院和放映队发展到一万二千三百七十四个，比一九五七年增加百分之二十四。出版报纸一千八百八十四种，共计发行四十八万九千九百九十九万份；出版杂志八百一十八种，发行五万三千七百零五万册；出版图书四万六千零一十八种，共计二十三万九千三百零九万册。博物馆和县以上的展览馆发展到九百所，县以上的公共图书馆发展到八百四十八所。高等文化艺术学校发展到三十五所，中等艺术学校一百三十八所。上述各项文化艺术事业的发展情况，如和一九四九年相比，一般都增长了几倍甚至几十倍。一九五八年可以说是我国文化艺术事业发展的新高峰。
    在一九五八年的大跃进中，文化艺术工作认真地贯彻执行了党所指示的为工农兵服务、为政治、为生产服务的正确方针。文化艺术工作配合各项政治运动和生产运动，普遍和深入地向广大人民群众进行了社会主义、共产主义教育，提高了他们的思想觉悟，鼓舞了他们的劳动热忱和革命干劲。经过整风运动和反右派斗争，广大文化艺术工作者的政治思想水平得到进一步的提高，大大发挥了他们的工作积极性和主动精神。许多专业文艺工作者下乡、下厂、下连队，深入生活，深入群众，进行社会主义文化的普及工作，并且积极参加劳动锻炼，进一步改造和提高自己，做到思想和业务双丰收。同时，由于群众业余文化活动的蓬勃开展，一年来全国各地有成千上万的业余的文学艺术活动的积极分子和骨干分子从工农兵群众和学生群众中涌现出来，这就大大地壮大了我国的文化艺术队伍。
    更加谦虚踏实地做好文化工作
    我们的文化必须在群众中生根
    如上所述，我们的文化艺术工作，如同我们其它方面的工作一样，成绩是巨大的。但是我们今后的任务十分艰巨，我们的工作也还有许多缺点，因此我们决不能有丝毫的自满和松懈，而应当更加谦虚更加踏实地做好我们的工作。全国文化艺术工作者应当继续鼓足干劲，争取在一九五九年的各项工作中有更好的跃进。我们的这种干劲，必须同高度的科学精神和务实精神相结合，要使文化工作愈做愈细致，愈做愈踏实。我们的这种跃进，首先应当表现在我们的思想上，表现在我们的文学、艺术的创作质量和工作质量上。这就是说，我们一方面要继续做文化普及的工作，另一方面要大力进行提高。周总理在他的报告中指出，“继续调动文教战线上的一切积极因素，向前推进文化革命的事业，普及社会主义的文化，并且不断地在普及的基础上进行巩固和提高的工作，使文教工作的发展能够适应整个社会主义建设的需要，这就是我们的任务。”我相信全国文化艺术工作者一定能够热烈响应周总理的这个号召，为完成这个光荣任务而奋斗。
    我们正在创造和建设的文化是社会主义的文化，它的任务不但要正确地反映社会主义的经济和政治，而且要有效地促进社会主义的经济和政治。这种文化同资本主义、封建主义的文化迥然不同，它是真正属于人民的文化，是全民的文化，它必须在群众里面生根。在我们这样一个文化还是落后的国家里，人民群众是迫切需要文化和科学知识的，他们要求掌握文化，要求成为文化的主人。因此我们必须做好群众文化工作，而且要搞群众的文化运动。没有群众的文化运动，没有广大群众作基础，要建设社会主义的文化，是不可能的。为了要发展群众文化，开展群众文化活动，我们还要有正确的工作方针。首先，我们的文化必须为发展社　会生产力服务，文化同生产要有正确的配合，文化必须有利于生产，而决不能不利于生产。群众文化活动必须坚持业余的原则，并且要厉行节约，坚决防止盲目脱产和专业化，反对铺张浪费。其次，开展群众文化工作要根据群众的需要、自愿和实际的可能。为了满足群众文化生活的需要，我们的作家和艺术家，应当更多和更好地为工农兵写出为他们所喜闻乐见的文艺作品，演他们所喜欢看的戏，唱他们所喜欢听的歌，以社会主义、共产主义的精神鼓舞群众，教育群众。同时，我们还要注意到群众的精神需要是多方面的，我们的文化艺术工作应当尽可能地从多方面去满足群众各种不同的需要，除了给他们以教育和鼓舞以外，也要使他们享受到有益的娱乐，并且能够提高他们的欣赏趣味。当然，这样做，仅仅依靠专业的文学家、艺术家和专业的文化艺术团体是不够的。为了满足广大群众的文化生活需要，就必须配合各地当前的中心工作和生产任务，适当地组织和开展群众业余的文化艺术活动，并对他们进行必要的帮助和辅导。群众的业余文化艺术活动，是群众自我教育和自我娱乐的活动，我们不能对他们提出任何过高的实际上办不到的要求。同时，开展群众文化艺术活动一定要出于他们的自愿，而决不要强迫他们做这做那，也不要硬性地为他们规定任务。毛主席在十五年前写的“文化工作中的统一战线”那篇文章中就讲得非常清楚，他说：“我们的文化是人民的文化，文化工作者必须有为人民服务的高度的热忱，必须联系群众，而不要脱离群众。要联系群众，就要按照群众的需要和自愿。……这里是两条原则：一条是群众的实际上的需要，而不是我们脑子里头幻想出来的需要；一条是群众的自愿，由群众自己下决心，而不是由我们替群众下决心。”我们要做好群众文化工作，就一定要按照毛主席的这些指示办事。
    努力提高文艺创作的质量
    充分反映我们伟大的时代
    我还想就文艺创作问题讲一点意见。文艺创作是全部文化艺术工作中最主要的问题。没有创作也就没有文化艺术工作。因此，如何进一步地发展和繁荣文学艺术创作，是当前第一重要的问题。为了我国文学艺术的健全发展，应当在为社会主义服务的基础上，认真地贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。发展在科学上不同学派、不同见解的自由争论，发展在艺术上不同形式、不同风格的自由竞赛，这是促使我国科学和艺术发展繁荣的唯一正确的方针。对文艺创作，在政治上和思想上必须要有坚强的领导，就是说必须要有马克思列宁主义的领导，必须坚持为社会主义、共产主义服务的方向。这是我们坚定不移的原则。但是，在艺术的表现形式和风格上，以及在题材的选择上，作家就有充分的自由，而不受任何拘束；在这些方面他们完全可以而且应该充分地展开自由竞赛。我们的社会主义文化大花园，要的是万紫千红的“百花齐放”，而决不是冷冷清清的一花独放。
    周总理在他的政府工作报告中指出，“我们应当鼓励专业的文学家、艺术家，经过艰苦的努力，用思想性和艺术性更高的作品来教育人民群众，满足人民群众的文化生活要求。”要做到这样，我们认为最重要的问题是文艺工作者应当同群众长期结合，在生活实践中加强锻炼自己。我们不能认为这个问题已经完全解决了，我们只能说问题刚刚开始在解决。去年大批文艺工作者下乡下厂，是一个很好的开端。今后还要更好地注意真正使他们长期地与群众结合，真正和群众建立起一种血肉般的密切联系，真正在群众中生根，同群众共呼吸。作家、艺术家要有丰富的生活经验和斗争经验，这是一方面；另一方面还要有高度的政治敏感，渊博的知识和丰富的想象力，以及一定水平的文学艺术修养和表现力，这样才有可能创作真正的好作品。所以，作家、艺术家除了深入群众，熟悉生活，加强锻炼，改造思想而外，还必须虚心地勤恳地学习，认真在艺术表现技巧上苦练精修。不注意技巧是不对的。在学习的问题上，古今中外，一切好的对我们建设社会主义文化有用的东西，我们都要学，都要有计划地认真地学。任何学来的东西，都不能当作教条，而必须结合当前我国的实际，有分析有批判地运用它们，使其作为养料，来丰富和提高我们的文学艺术创造。
    近几年来，我国的专业文艺作家和业余作者，曾经写出了不少的好作品，这是非常可喜的。但也有一些作品的思想性和艺术性还不高。所以，今后应当注意努力提高文艺创作的质量。为了帮助文艺创作的提高，我们还需要大大发展文艺批评和文艺理论工作。近来文艺界对这方面的工作已经比较地注意了，并且已经取得了一些成绩，但是，就整个文艺工作的发展要求来看，仍然是很不够的。为了鼓励文艺创作和帮助读者提高文艺欣赏的能力，我们希望文艺批评家更多地注意文艺评论工作，更多地介绍和推荐好的作品。对于那些写得不够好的作品或者有严重缺点的作品，也需要认真地实事求是地进行批评，这对读者和作者都是一种教育和帮助。文艺工作者都应当加强自己的理论学习，文艺研究机构要大大加强有系统地整理资料和文艺理论的研究工作。这是建设社会主义文化的重要环节，我们决不能忽视。
    各位代表！我们是处在一个多么伟大多么光辉灿烂的时代！我们的生活多么丰富多彩！党和人民要求我们的文学艺术能够充分地反映这个伟大的时代，更好地为社会主义服务。我们相信，全国各民族的文化艺术工作者，在党和政府的领导下，一定能够在过去工作的基础上，把文学艺术创作和整个文化工作推向更加繁荣昌盛的阶段，而无愧于这伟大的时代。
    我们坚持和平共处五项原则也不容许别人干涉我国内政
    各位代表！正当我们伟大的祖国在建设和平幸福新生活的康庄大道上健步如飞，成绩辉煌的时候，西藏一小撮上层反动分子却在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的唆使和支持　下，公开发动武装叛乱，背叛祖国，破坏统一。　他们妄图在西藏恢复帝国主义的侵略势力，使　西藏永远沦为暗无天日的人间地狱。西藏上层反动集团这一滔天叛国罪行引起了西藏僧俗人民和全中国人民的莫大愤慨。我们的人民解放　军驻西藏部队，在全国人民的支持下，奉命迅　速地平定了拉萨地区的叛乱，并且控制了整个西藏的局势。这个西藏反动叛国集团在叛乱失败后，竟劫走了达赖喇嘛，进入印度境内。四月　十八日在印度的提斯浦尔地方，竟然经由印度外交官员散发了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这是一个谎话连篇、前后支吾、荒谬透顶的文　件。发表在本月二十一日人民日报上的新华社政治记者的评论，以铁一般的事实，严正地驳斥了这个所谓“声明”。这篇所谓“声明”除了对我们祖国百般造谣诬蔑以外，最主要的是大谈其所谓西藏独立。全中国人民和全世界人民都清清楚楚地知道，数百年来，西藏一向是中国的领土，它从来不是一个独立国，也没有一个国家承认它是独立国，和它建立外交关系。但是现在这篇由印度外交官员散发的，而据英国通讯社路透社报导，是“在同尼赫鲁总理的使节梅农在邦迪拉举行了若干次长时间的会议以后拟定的”（路透社四月十八日新德里电），又据法国通讯社法新社报道，是经过“印度政府的赞同”并且能够“间接地说出一些”为印度政府所“难于直接说的东西”（法新社四月十八日新德里电）的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，却从开头强调“西藏人一向有一种要求独立的强烈愿望”起，整篇贯穿着一种颠倒黑白、以图迷惑世界人民（包括印度人民）的企图；照这篇声明看来，好象达赖喇嘛简直不是一个中国人，所谓“他的国家”也真象是一个独立国家似的。但是，“司马昭之心，路人皆知”，这篇所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，却最充分地暴露了这个文件的作者所具有的那副承继老牌帝国主义衣钵的扩张主义者的丑恶嘴脸。他们似乎已经忘记中国人民热爱和平，但是决不是软弱可欺的。我们正告一切帝国主义和反动派，已经站立起来的中国人民，决不容许任何人搞阴谋，侵犯我们的主权，决不容许任何人染指我国任何部分的神圣领土。野心家的企图一定要落空！我们对于被劫持的达赖喇嘛保持着同胞的关切，并且期待着他能安然回到祖国的怀抱。我们衷心地愿望继续发展和巩固中国人民同我们伟大邻邦印度人民的亲密友谊。我们坚持执行和平共处的五项原则。我们决不想干涉别国的内政，我们也决不容许别人干涉我们的内政。全中国的文化艺术界人士和全中国人民一道，坚决和热烈地拥护我国政府对西藏问题所采取的各项措施。我们坚决地相信，落后、黑暗、残酷的旧西藏不久即将成为过去，目前飘在喜马拉雅山顶上的一片乌云不久即将被和煦的东风吹散刮尽，而东方的太阳将永远向全世界放射它无限的光明。
