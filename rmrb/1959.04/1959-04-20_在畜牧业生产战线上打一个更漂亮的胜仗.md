　　Win an Even More Splendid Victory on the Animal Husbandry Production Front

　　(Our dispatch) The hundreds of thousands of herdsmen of all nationalities in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province are now engaged in lambing and raising lambs, and hot-mating work with great enthusiasm, striving to win an even more splendid victory on the animal husbandry production front this year.

　　Under the favorable conditions of the establishment of people's communes in most areas, many places have grasped the guideline of "taking sturdiness as the key link" and strengthened the feeding and management of livestock. Last year, various places cut a total of more than 136 million catties of green hay and built more than 7,490 new sheds, so that most of the old, weak and sick livestock were supplemented with feed, basically achieving that large livestock have pens and young livestock have sheds. During the lambing period, the people's communes in various places put the most experienced laboring herdsmen on the front line, increased the number of herders, vigorously promoted "experimental groups" and "high-yield groups," and implemented herding with the groups, and taking turns guarding the lambs at night. Some people's communes have also allocated many tents for pregnant livestock to keep warm during lambing. Herders take care of the lambs with utmost care. For lambs that lack milk or have no milk to eat, the herders use feeders to supplement them with milk and paste. In some areas of the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, artificial nursing stations have been established to concentrate milk-deficient lambs and assign special personnel to feed them. Many places have also carried out mass veterinary epidemic prevention work. The Canmei People's Commune in Henan Mongolian Autonomous County established four lamb hospitals to concentrate on treating sick lambs. Thanks to the meticulous feeding of the herdsmen, the survival rate of lambs born in various places is mostly above 90%. While lambing and raising lambs, various places have generally adopted artificial insemination methods to forcibly breed ewes that have aborted, suffered from prolapse, and lost lambs, as well as some strong ewes with lambs, to increase the chances of producing multiple lambs in one birth. Therefore, many high-yield livestock groups have emerged. The Changmu District Brigade of the Guide County People's Commune has 350 ewes, which gave birth twice in fifteen months, and 19 ewes gave birth to twins in one birth, producing a total of 719 lambs, of which 717 survived, with a breeding rate as high as 204%. The broad masses of herdsmen are further proposing the slogan of "breed as soon as they give birth, two births a year, multiple lambs in one birth, a hundred horses for a hundred mares, and a hundred calves for a hundred cows," striving to achieve an all-round bumper harvest of various livestock this year.

　　在畜牧业生产战线上打一个更漂亮的胜仗
    本报讯　青海省牧业区的数十万各族牧民正热火朝天地进行接羔育羔、热胎配种工作，争取今年在畜牧业生产战线上打一个更漂亮的胜仗。
    在大部分地区已建立人民公社的有利条件下，许多地方都抓住了“以壮为纲”的纲领，加强了对牲畜的饲养管理。去年各地共割除青干草一亿三千六百多万斤，新修棚圈七千四百九十多个，使大多数老弱病畜得到补饲，基本上作到了大畜有圈和幼畜有棚。在产羔期间，各地人民公社都把最有经验的劳动牧民放在第一线，增加了放牧人员，大搞“试验群”和“丰产群”，实行跟群放牧，值班守夜接羔。有的人民公社还调剂出很多帐房，供怀孕母畜在产羔时取暖。放牧员对羊羔的爱护更是无微不至。给缺奶或没有奶吃的羔羊，放牧员就用哺乳器补饲牛奶、面糊。黄南藏族自治州有些地方成立了人工哺乳站，将缺奶羔羊集中起来，指定专人喂养。许多地方还开展了群众性的兽疫防治工作。河南蒙族自治县参美人民公社成立了四个羊羔病院集中治疗生病羔羊。由于牧民的精心饲养，各地已产羔羊繁殖成活率大都在90％以上。各地在接羔育羔的同时，普遍采取了人工催情的办法，给流产、穿怀和死掉羔羊的母羊以及部分体质强壮的带羔母羊，进行强制配种，增加一胎多羔的机会。因此，出现了许多高产畜群。贵德县人民公社常牧区大队有三百五十只母绵羊，在十五个月内产了两胎，有十九只母羊一胎产了双羔，共产羔羊七百一十九只，成活七百一十七只，繁殖率高达204％。广大牧民正进一步提出“随产随配，一年两产，一胎多羔，百马百驹，百牛百犊”的口号，力争今年各种牲畜要获得全面丰收。
