    New Business of Department Stores

    The Liuduqiao Department Store in Wuhan recently broke the convention that large department stores do not engage in repair services. It has made full use of the skills of its sales staff to comprehensively carry out twenty-four repair and mending services. These include: attaching sock soles, replacing shirt collars, repairing leather shoes and rubber shoes, and repairing lighters, radios, clocks, flashlights, fountain pens, and simple musical instruments. In addition, it also repairs umbrellas, mends enamelware holes, and various ball bladders, etc. It is very popular with the masses.

    武汉六渡桥百货商店最近打破了大百货商店不搞修理业务的陈规，充分运用营业员的技能，全面开展二十四项修理、修补业务。其中包括：绱袜底，换衬衫领，修理皮鞋、胶鞋，打火机、收音机、钟表、手电筒、自来水笔、简单的乐器。此外还修补雨伞，搪瓷器皿破洞，各种球胆等。很受群众欢迎。
