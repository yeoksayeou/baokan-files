Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 9th: Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a television address in Berlin on the evening of the 9th, requesting that the governments of the two Germanies hold negotiations before the East-West foreign ministers' meeting on May 11th, so that the two Germanies can reach a consensus on the issue of the German peace treaty.

In his television address, Premier Grotewohl said that for several months, the focus of German public discussion has been on the issue of concluding a German peace treaty. In Germany, there is no topic of conversation more important than this. Because the conclusion of a German peace treaty is, in fact, the decisive key to normalizing the German situation, it will further eliminate the grave threat of a devastating atomic war to the German people and create favorable conditions for the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Therefore, the government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the foreign ministers' meeting to be held in May this year to discuss the issue of a German peace treaty, and will spare no effort to ensure that the meeting achieves fruitful results. The most fervent wish of the government of the German Democratic Republic is that all negotiations will ultimately lead to a peace conference, so that the German people's efforts to strive for peace will ultimately succeed.

Grotewohl said that if the Federal Government could make the same efforts to ensure the success of the foreign ministers' meeting, the prospects for the Geneva negotiations would be much better. Unfortunately, the Federal Government has so far not accepted the proposal of the government of the German Democratic Republic that representatives of the two Germanies discuss and decide on a unified German position on the issue of the German peace treaty.

Grotewohl said that precisely because the conclusion of a German peace treaty involves a series of issues, the two German governments must jointly seek a path before the moment arrives when the fate of the German people will be decided in Geneva, so as to make the resolution of these issues easier. The issues of German peace and European peace will be resolved in Geneva. These two issues require the German people and their two governments to make the greatest efforts to eliminate existing tensions and prevent the threat of atomic war. The two German governments must show the world that they can reach an understanding on the issue of the German peace treaty.

Grotewohl said that the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that, because they must jointly represent the national interests of our people and their demands for a peace treaty, the two German governments must abandon all formal considerations, and the guiding principle of their actions can only be to strive for security and peace. I firmly believe that if the Federal Republic reaches out to shake the hand extended to it by the German Democratic Republic, it will be in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of the people.

Grotewohl then, on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic, proposed to Adenauer that he appoint representatives to negotiate with representatives of the German Democratic Republic in order to jointly determine a German position on the issue of the German peace treaty. He said that we believe that if the two German governments can reach a unified position on the peace treaty issue before the agreed international conference is held, it will greatly help the resolution of the German peace treaty issue.

Grotewohl said that the government of the German Democratic Republic is willing at any time to discuss the fate of Germany with representatives of the Federal Government. It and the entire German people expect the Federal Government to finally adopt a similar attitude, so that the danger of atomic war can be eliminated by the German people, and a peaceful prospect can be given to Germany.

Grotewohl called on the entire German people to support this policy of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

In his television address, Premier Grotewohl also read out the letter he wrote to the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Adenauer, on the issue of negotiations between representatives of the two German governments.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 9th: The Office of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic announced that the letter written by Premier Grotewohl to Adenauer on the issue of negotiations between representatives of the two Germanies was delivered to the Office of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic on the afternoon of the 9th.

In his letter, Premier Grotewohl wrote that on May 11th of this year, the foreign ministers of the four major powers and the government representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany will begin discussions on the issue of the German peace treaty in Geneva. The government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes these negotiations. In order to realize the German people's legitimate demands for a German peace treaty, the government of the German Democratic Republic will not give up its efforts, and if the Federal Government also strives for an effective solution to this issue, an agreement can be reached more easily and quickly.

Grotewohl wrote that the most consistent position possible between the two German governments is entirely conducive to resolving the German issue. The government of the German Democratic Republic proposed to the Federal Government last September that a committee composed of representatives of the two Germanies be established to determine Germany's position on the issue of the German peace treaty. We have always believed that this is the best way to reach a consensus, and we are willing to take corresponding steps.

Grotewohl said, I propose that representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany immediately conduct negotiations without considering any formalities, so that the two German governments can reach a consensus on their attitude toward the peace treaty. If the Federal Government has conducted negotiations with foreign governments on issues of vital concern to Germany, and if it continues to refuse to negotiate with the government of the German Democratic Republic, the German people will never understand this.

Grotewohl said that most of the German people expect clear measures to be taken to create an atmosphere of understanding. Most of the German people hope to finally begin preparations for the conclusion of a German peace treaty in order to stop the further exacerbation of the situation in Germany and Europe. Grotewohl hopes that Adenauer will also fulfill this wish. He said that the German Democratic Republic will do everything in its power to realize this wish.

　　格罗提渥建议两个德国的代表会谈
　　共同决定在对德和约问题上的一致立场
    新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥9日晚在柏林发表电视演说，要求两个德国的政府在5月11日东西方外长会议以前举行谈判，以便使两个德国在对德和约问题上取得一致的观点。
    格罗提渥总理在电视演说中说，几个月来，德国公众谈论的中心一直围绕着缔结对德和约问题。在德国，没有比这个问题更重要的谈话题目了。因为，缔结对德和约事实上是使德国局势正常化的决定性关键，它将进一步消除对德国人的毁灭性的原子战争的严重威胁，并能为德国的和平统一创造良好的条件。
    因此，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎今年5月召开的讨论对德和约问题的外长会议，并且将不遗余力地努力使会议得到富有成效的结果。德意志民主共和国政府最殷切的愿望是，一切的谈判最后通向和平会议，使德国人民争取和平的努力最后得以成功。
    格罗提渥说，如果联邦政府能作出同样的努力争取使外长会议获得成功的话，日内瓦谈判的前景就会好得多。遗憾的是，联邦政府迄今没有接受德意志民主共和国政府的建议，由两个德国的代表讨论并决定在对德和约问题上的统一的德国立场。
    格罗提渥说，正因为缔结对德和约牵涉到一系列的问题，因此两个德国政府必须在日内瓦决定德国人民命运的时刻来到之前，共同寻求一条道路，以便使这些问题的解决更为容易。在日内瓦将要解决德国和平和欧洲和平的问题。这两个问题要求德国人民和他们的两个政府尽最大努力消除现有的紧张和阻止原子战争威胁。两个德国政府必须向世界表明，它们能够在对德和约问题上达成谅解。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国政府认为，由于必须共同代表我国人民的民族利益和他们对和约的要求，两个德国政府必须放弃一切形式上的考虑，它们的行动的主导思想只能是努力争取安全和和平。我坚决相信，联邦共和国如果伸手去握德意志民主共和国向它伸出的手的话，这将符合绝大多数人民的愿望。
    格罗提渥接着代表德意志民主共和国政府向阿登纳提出建议，希望他委派代表和德意志民主共和国的代表进行谈判，以便共同确定一个在对德和约问题上的德国立场。他说，我们认为如果两个德国政府在已商定的国际会议召开之前，能在和约问题上达成一致的立场的话，这将大大有助于对德和约问题的解决。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国政府任何时候都愿意同联邦政府的代表讨论德国的命运问题。它和全德人民都期望联邦政府终于能采取类似的态度，以便使原子战争的危险由德国人民来消除，并给德国一个和平的远景。
    格罗提渥号召全德人民支持德意志民主共和国政府的这一政策。
    格罗提渥总理在发表电视演说中，还宣读了他就两个德国政府的代表进行谈判的问题写给德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳的信。
    新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国部长会议主席团办公厅宣布，格罗提渥总理就两个德国的代表进行谈判的问题写给阿登纳的信，已于9日下午由德意志民主共和国外交部交给德意志联邦共和国总理办公厅。
    格罗提渥总理在信中写道，今年5月11日四大国外交部长和德意志民主共和国以及德意志联邦共和国的政府代表将在日内瓦开始讨论对德和约问题。德意志民主共和国政府欢迎这次谈判。为了实现德国人民对对德和约的正当要求，德意志民主共和国政府不会放弃努力，如果联邦政府同样为有成效地解决这个问题而努力，就能更容易地和迅速地达成协议。
    格罗提渥写道，两个德国政府的尽可能一致的立场，完全有助于解决德国问题。德意志民主共和国政府去年9月曾向联邦政府提出建议，建议建立一个由两个德国的代表组织的、确定德国在对德和约问题上的立场的委员会。我们始终认为，这是达成双方意见一致的最好的道路，并愿意采取相应的步骤。
    格罗提渥说，我建议，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表，在不要考虑任何形式的条件下，立即进行谈判，以便使两个德国政府在对和约的态度上达成一致意见。如果联邦政府同外国政府进行了关于德国切身问题的谈判，如果它继续拒绝同德意志民主共和国政府谈判，德国人民决不会理解这一点。
    格罗提渥说，大多数德国人民期望采取明确的措施来创造谅解的气氛。大多数德国人民希望能终于开始准备缔结对德和约，以便制止德国和欧洲局势的进一步尖锐化。格罗提渥希望阿登纳也来满足这个愿望。他说，德意志民主共和国将尽自己的一切力量来实现这一愿望。
