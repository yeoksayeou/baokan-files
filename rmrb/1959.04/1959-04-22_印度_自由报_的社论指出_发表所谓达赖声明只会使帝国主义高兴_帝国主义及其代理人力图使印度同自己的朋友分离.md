Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 21st. The "Free Press" published an editorial yesterday commenting on the so-called Dalai Lama's statement, pointing out that "This statement will not please anyone except the imperialists and those incited and influenced by them. To all reasonable people, it has become very clear that this attack on neighboring China from Indian territory will entail serious dangers for India's own interests."

The newspaper also said that publishing this so-called Dalai Lama's statement "will further poison India's political atmosphere."

The newspaper further said, "Even among those most sympathetic to the Dalai Lama, there is doubt as to whether this statement was really made by the Dalai Lama himself. Not only the wording and style of the statement, but even the skillful embellishments of the statement, cannot but be noticed by them."

The newspaper said, "The question remains, why take this unnatural approach?" It said, "Was this premeditated? If so, did the Indian Ministry of External Affairs not know and did not guard against this? It is very reasonable that such questions arise in the mind of every Indian today."

The newspaper pointed out, "Sino-Indian friendship and Panchsheel are not just verbal expressions." The newspaper said, "It is a necessary protective shield for India's independence today; it protects India's sovereignty from Anglo-American economic and political offensives. The thought of what will happen if this shield is lost is chilling."

It said, "If the policy of Sino-Indian friendship only stays on verbal expressions, no matter how firm and sincere the expressions are, it may fail in practice."

The newspaper pointed out that the so-called Dalai Lama's statement was published in Tezpur in the presence of representatives of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. The newspaper said that this will "make friends doubt whether India's friendly attitude towards China is firm."

The newspaper also condemned the People's Socialist Party of India leader, Mehta's, "demand to allow the Dalai Lama to operate as a government on Indian soil" as an attempt to "change India's foreign policy and its domestic policy in favor of American imperialism."

The newspaper said, "We want to eliminate the danger of the US-Pakistan military agreement. In this danger, our greatest friend is the socialist world, especially Sino-Indian friendship. Cunning foreign imperialists and their local agents want to separate us from our friends on the Tibet issue and want to make us relax our vigilance against this danger."

    印度“自由报”的社论指出
    发表所谓达赖声明只会使帝国主义高兴
    帝国主义及其代理人力图使印度同自己的朋友分离
  　新华社新德里21日电　“自由报”昨天发表社论，评论所谓达赖喇嘛的声明时指出，“除了帝国主义者以及受他们煽动和影响的人以外，这种声明不会使任何人高兴。对一切通情达理的人来说，事情已经变得非常清楚，从印度领土上对邻邦中国进行的这种攻击将为印度本身的利益招致严重的危险。”
    这家报纸还说，发表这项所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，“将进一步毒化印度的政治气氛”。
    这家报纸进一步说，“甚至在最同情达赖喇嘛的人士中间也怀疑这项声明是否真是达赖喇嘛本人作出的。不仅是声明的文字和文体，甚至是声明的巧妙的修饰，也不能不为他们所注意。”
    这家报纸说，“问题仍然是，为什么要采取这种不自然的做法。”它说，“这是不是预谋的？如果是这样，印度外交部难道不知道和没有提防这件事吗？今天在每一个印度人心中产生这种问题是非常合情合理的。”
    报纸指出，“中印友谊和潘查希拉不仅是口头的表示”。报纸说，“它在今天对印度的独立来说是必要的保护盾牌；它保护印度主权免遭英美在经济和政治上的进攻。一想到如果失掉这个盾牌将会发生什么事，不禁令人毛骨悚然。”
    它说，“如果中印友好的政策只是停留在口头表示上，尽管表示得多么坚决和诚恳，它在实际中是可能失败的”。
    这家报纸指出，所谓达赖喇嘛的声明是在提斯浦尔在印度外交部代表在场的情况下发表的。报纸说，这将“使朋友们怀疑印度对中国的友好态度是否坚定。”
    报纸还谴责印度人民社会党领袖梅达“要求允许达赖喇嘛在印度土地上作为政府来进行活动”的做法，是想“改变印度的外交政策以及它的内政政策以利于美帝国主义”。
    这家报纸说，“我们要消除美国—巴基斯坦军事协定的危险。在这种危险中，我们最伟大的朋友是社会主义世界，特别是中印友谊。狡猾的外国帝国主义和他们的当地代理人想要在西藏问题上使我们同我们的朋友分离，并且想要使我们放松对这种危险的警惕。”
