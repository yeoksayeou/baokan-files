The Government Work Report Inspires People Across the Country
Determined to Continue the Great Leap Forward with Creative Labor

　　This newspaper reports that the news of the opening of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai at the meeting greatly inspired the labor enthusiasm of the people from all walks of life in the capital. They cheered for the great achievements made by the motherland in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and are determined to use better creative labor to resolutely complete the 1959 national economic plan and continue the Great Leap Forward.
　　On the afternoon of the 18th, workers of industrial and mining enterprises, cadres of organs, teachers and students of schools, and members of people's communes generally listened to the live broadcast of the conference by the radio station, and many people automatically held discussions. On the morning of the 19th, the newspaper stands on the streets and public places were crowded with readers; the circulation of People's Daily, Beijing Daily and other newspapers that published the conference report and the full text of Premier Zhou's report increased by more than 150,000 copies compared with usual.
　　Workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, who have already overfulfilled the pig iron production plan for the first half of April, were greatly encouraged after listening to the full broadcast of Premier Zhou's report. They said: We must muster greater efforts and strive to overproduce more pig iron to complete the April plan. The workers of the Beijing Steel Plant launched a labor competition from the 12th to welcome the opening of the conference. The miners of the Muchengjian Coal Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, who were working underground, launched a new upsurge of producing more coal and producing good coal. On the 18th, Zhang Qiurong's team of the Muchengjian Mine No. 3 originally planned to produce 139 tons of coal, but everyone worked together and produced 350 tons in six hours.
　　Many members and cadres of the people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing held discussions in the fields after listening to Premier Zhou's report. The cadres of the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune in Chaoyang District unanimously supported Premier Zhou's report in the discussions held in the fields, and in light of the commune's situation, proposed to respond to the call of the Party and the People's Government with practical actions to continue implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase and do a good job in spring sowing. Li Zonghe, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Huangtugang Production Station of the Huangtugang People's Commune, which won the title of National Advanced Agricultural Unit last year, said: We must maintain the honor we received last year, muster greater efforts, and double the output of grain and vegetables this year. We must run the people's commune well under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and fiercely counterattack the slander of imperialism.
　　Teachers and students of various schools listened to the live broadcast of the conference on the 18th, and generally read the newspapers yesterday. Many people also gathered together to discuss. Zhang Jingyue, the director of the Biology Department of Peking University, said: Premier Zhou's deep concern and expectation for the self-transformation of old intellectuals in the Government Work Report greatly encouraged me. As an old intellectual, on the one hand, I must strive to better impart my knowledge to young teachers and students, and train talents for the country faster and better; at the same time, I am determined to more earnestly transform my thinking so that I can also become a worker-class intellectual who is both red and expert as soon as possible, and contribute more to the socialist construction cause.
　　Teachers and students of the Central University for Nationalities listened to Premier Zhou's Government Work Report with great excitement, and the whole school was filled with an atmosphere of national unity and joy. Wang Qu, a Tibetan teacher, said: "I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report; especially the Tibetan issue mentioned in the report, which completely expressed the feelings of our Tibetan people. We fully support the wise measures of the Party and the Central People's Government, resolutely support the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, defend the unity of the motherland, and will never allow imperialism to interfere in our internal affairs. Our Tibetan people unite with the people of all nationalities across the country and strive to build a prosperous and happy socialist new Tibet under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao."
　　This newspaper reports that the vast number of workers in Shenyang, Anshan Iron and Steel, Changchun, Taiyuan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Guizhou and the members of the people's communes, after listening to the live recording of the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, enthusiastically expressed that they would support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and congratulate the convening of this People's Congress with practical actions.
　　The mechanical and electrical workers of Shenyang City warmly responded to Premier Zhou's call and are determined to muster their efforts to complete the manufacturing task of six major equipment ahead of schedule and overfulfill the plan, and support the completion of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, the workers of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant were greatly encouraged. On the evening of the 18th, Zhang Shaolin, a worker of the eight-meter lathe in the first workshop, processed a rolling mill shaft and completed fifteen hours of work in seven hours. The output of screw caps processed by Sun Kejing, a female worker of the No. 62 lathe in the standard section of the second workshop, was equivalent to more than forty hours of work in one shift.
　　More than 100,000 steel workers of Anshan Iron and Steel expressed their firm support after listening to the Government Work Report. On the 18th, the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and ninth blast furnaces of the Anshan Iron and Steel Smelting Plant all overfulfilled their daily plans and produced 181 tons more of high-quality pig iron for the country, saving 87 tons of coke.
　　Many workers and engineering technicians in various workshops and industrial departments of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant said excitedly after listening to the Government Work Report that in order to complete the Great Leap Forward plan, we must muster greater efforts to ensure the production tasks of the six major equipment and the Red Flag sedan that the plant is responsible for. Wang Yongshun, an old worker in the locomotive workshop of the Changchun Locomotive Plant with 32 years of work experience, said that listening to Premier Zhou's report made my heart warmer for building socialism. I am determined to teach all my skills to my apprentices and strengthen the strength of building socialism. Deputy Chief Engineer Pang Zhiming said: I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report. We must produce more locomotives and produce good locomotives to ensure the Great Leap Forward in this year's construction.
　　After listening to the report, the workers of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company launched a production competition. Encouraged by the conference, the workers of the Third Rolling Mill overfulfilled the daily production plan by 15.7% on the 18th, creating the highest daily production level in the history of the entire plant. The employees of the Shanxi Machine Factory unanimously expressed that they would strive to complete three and a half months of work in April to celebrate the convening of the conference.
　　The workers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company guaranteed to further carry out the competition centered on "attacking sulfur and protecting steel", fully promote communist collaboration, and create excellent achievements of high yield, high quality, and multiple varieties to celebrate the convening of the National People's Congress. After discussing Premier Zhou's report, the workers of the No. 3 and No. 4 workshops of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Plant were full of confidence and revised the Great Leap Forward plan for the entire workshop for the entire year, deciding to complete the annual plan one quarter ahead of schedule.
　　Steel and machinery workers from factories such as the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant, Guangzhou Jiehe Iron and Steel Plant, and Guangzhou No. 1 Heavy Machinery Plant all used new production achievements as practical actions to support the Premier's report. Advanced producers of the Guangzhou No. 1 Heavy Machinery Plant discussed the Premier's report. Riveter Huang Yingbai said at the meeting that the workers in their group held a meeting and proposed to make a big fuss about technological revolution during the convening of the National People's Congress, using indigenous methods to manufacture a large indigenous machine tool to increase production efficiency tenfold.
　　Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report greatly encouraged the people of all ethnic groups on the Guizhou Plateau. The members of the Wudang People's Commune in the suburbs of Guiyang City, the first commune established in the province, held discussions one after another on the evening of the 18th. Gao Xijun, the Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, said that every sentence of the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou is what our farmers want to say. The establishment of the people's commune for more than half a year has shown its great superiority in promoting production. With the people's commune, this year's spring plowing production is better and faster than any year. At present, the corn sowing plan has been overfulfilled, and the rice sowing has also completed 70% of the plan. The thirteen small power plants built by the entire commune will all generate electricity during the National Day this year, with an average of 150 watts of electricity available to each member's household. Without the people's commune, these things would be difficult to do. The workers of the steelmaking workshop of the Guiyang Central Foundry celebrated the opening of the National People's Congress on the 18th with a new record of producing 15 tons of good steel per day. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, the workers created a record of producing 17 tons of good steel per day on the 19th.
