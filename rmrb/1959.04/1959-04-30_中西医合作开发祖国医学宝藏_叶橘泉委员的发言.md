Cooperation between Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine to Develop the Treasure Trove of Traditional Chinese Medicine
Speech by Committee Member Ye Juquan

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1959, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state final accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959.

Jiangsu's Treatment of Schistosomiasis: Traditional Chinese Medicine Played a Significant Role

I am a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and I would like to report to the conference on the work related to TCM. In recent years, encouraged by the Party's policies on TCM, TCM and Western medicine have united and cooperated to better leverage the strength and role of TCM. In Jiangsu Province, there are 17,406 TCM practitioners, with 1,200 working in state medical institutions. To cultivate successors, the province has established one TCM college, ten five-year TCM specialty schools in various special cities and counties, five four-year TCM schools, eleven health schools with TCM classes, and 3,359 TCM apprentices. Furthermore, twenty-four TCM hospitals have been established. Each city and county's comprehensive hospitals and county people's hospitals have TCM departments. In all cities and counties, 498 TCM practitioners are serving as people's representatives and CPPCC members. Thanks to the Party's concern for people's health, the development of TCM, and the raising of the political status of TCM, the vast number of TCM practitioners have been greatly encouraged. Particularly after the great rectification movement, TCM played a significant role in the treatment of late-stage schistosomiasis. Jiangsu is a severely affected area for schistosomiasis, with the disease prevalent in 47 out of 77 counties and cities. According to surveys, there were over 1,174,000 positive patients. From 1950 to 1957, over 375,000 patients were treated, and from January to October 1958, over 702,000 patients were treated, totaling over 1,077,000 patients, accounting for 91.35% of the positive patients. TCM medical personnel constituted 80% of the schistosomiasis prevention and control workforce. Among all positive patients, late-stage patients who had lost their ability to work accounted for over 8%, approximately 100,000 patients unsuitable for antimony injections, requiring treatment with TCM. After the rectification movement, Party committees at all levels personally took charge, organizing and mobilizing a large number of social TCM joint clinics, cooperating with prevention and control personnel, relying on the masses, holding meetings to discuss, everyone using their brains, everyone contributing ideas, investigating, registering, and classifying all late-stage patients, dividing them into several types such as ascites, masses, jaundice, diarrhea, etc., researching and formulating, and absorbing experience prescriptions from various places, preparing pills and powders, going down to the countryside and communities, assigning areas of responsibility, providing mobile medical services, delivering medicine to their doorsteps, providing convenience to the masses, facilitating production, not only were the medication costs economical, but the therapeutic effects were also very good. For example, the Zhenjiang Special District used Xiaoshui Dan and Huapi Wan, and the Suzhou Special District used Jinchansan and Weiling Wan to treat ascites and masses, with efficacy rates of over 75%. Medical personnel's political ideology took the lead. After exchanging experiences at the Zhenjiang on-site meeting, it was quickly promoted to various places to carry out comprehensive treatment. In just six months, from June to November 1958, 58,300 people were treated. During the on-site meeting in Zhenjiang Special District, we visited patients in Piqian Township. One patient reported that he had suffered from ascites for twelve years. In the past, in order to seek treatment, he had sold his old ox and incurred a lot of debt, but the disease was still not cured. Now Chairman Mao has sent doctors to deliver medicine to his door, costing him only four yuan, and the disease has been completely cured. He is now able to carry a hundred pounds of fertilizer to the fields. He said that he will only be able to repay Chairman Mao by doing a good job in production. Some patients, because they had sought medical treatment everywhere in the past and spent a lot of money, but repeatedly failed to achieve effective results, had lost confidence in medical treatment. When they were mobilized this time, they were initially unwilling to receive treatment. After the doctors patiently persuaded them, they still took the medicine with a try-and-see attitude. Many patients rapidly improved their symptoms and restored their physical strength after treatment. They excitedly said that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao could there be such good doctors; regardless of wind or rain, they came to our door to treat us. I was originally planning to wait for death, but the Communist Party and the People's Government saved me, and now I can participate in labor. In the treatment of schistosomiasis, many activists emerged. The revolutionary vigor and selfless labor of elderly TCM doctors moved patients and cooperation had a great impact. This reflects the correctness and greatness of the Party's TCM policy.

Close Cooperation Between TCM and Western Medicine: Overcoming Diseases and Benefiting the People

Technical cooperation between TCM and Western medicine to explore the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. Today, with the technical revolution and cultural revolution reaching a climax under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, a surge in learning TCM, applying TCM, and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine has been set off in medical units across the country. Under the leadership of the Party, TCM has emitted a brilliant light. Through clinical cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, applying TCM methods to treat acute and chronic appendicitis, hypertension, acute and chronic nephritis, schistosomiasis, intestinal parasites, whooping cough in children, measles, dysentery, tuberculous lymphadenitis, hemorrhoids and fistulas, aplastic anemia, fractures and dislocations, snake bites, thromboangiitis obliterans, infectious hepatitis, biliary ascariasis, epidemic encephalitis B, uterine prolapse, calculus, polio, etc., various places have reported significant curative effects. Some of these are diseases currently considered difficult to treat with Western medicine or requiring surgical treatment. Using TCM to treat them avoids surgery, is both simple and effective, and aligns with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. Currently, many hospitals are organizing TCM and Western medicine joint research teams to advance into cutting-edge sciences such as tumor radiotherapy.

As everyone knows, traditional Chinese medicine is the crystallization of our people's long-term and repeated practice. Science comes from practice. Its content and essence undoubtedly contain the essence of science. Its holistic concept and diagnostic methods in clinical medicine have certain advantages. However, due to historical limitations, it still has certain shortcomings in basic medicine. Therefore, it is necessary to organize and study it through cooperation between TCM and Western medicine. Because TCM and Western medicine are two different theoretical systems, there have been various different views in the past regarding what methods should be adopted for research and organization. The People's Daily editorial on January 25, "Conscientiously Implement the Party's TCM Policy," promptly and clearly pointed out to us: "There is a large amount of scientific essence in our country's medical heritage, and we must conscientiously absorb these essences, which is also a necessary condition for the development of our country's new medicine. And the means to explore and organize this great treasure house is the method of modern science." The editorial also pointed out: Ignoring the national nihilistic tendency of cultural heritage is wrong; thinking that the heritage can be organized without modern science is also wrong. Medical and health workers across the country should clearly recognize this issue. After studying the editorial, we deeply realized that only the Party can lead all science, and that organizing and researching the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine must follow the direction indicated by the Party, that TCM and Western medicine must closely unite, and that the scientific essence must be absorbed through clinical practice. Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the comprehensive observation of the relationship between humans and nature in practice, the symptoms expressed by human activity in the fight against disease, and thus summarized a whole set of theories such as the etiology of the seven emotions and six excesses, yin and yang, the five elements, the ying and wei qi and blood. This theory is used to guide clinical treatment. Therefore, I personally believe that consideration can be given to conducting research and clinical cooperation from the aspect of "symptoms." TCM doctors use compound prescriptions for treatment according to TCM theory, and Western medicine doctors analyze and observe according to modern medicine, starting with prescriptions and syndromes that have significant curative effects as soon as possible, such as Dahuang Mudanpi Tang for appendicitis, and Simiao Huoxue Tang for thromboangiitis obliterans, to study its mechanism of action. In modern medical theory, the use of laxatives is prohibited in appendicitis. TCM uses Dahuang Mudanpi Tang, not only is it not forbidden to use laxatives, but it also has good effects. Who is right and who is wrong? It must be verified through practice to test its scientific nature. Because many theories of traditional Chinese medicine cannot be explained by modern medicine at present, they should be studied with emphasis when practice proves effective. Even if its mechanism is not clear for the time being, it should be promoted and applied as soon as possible to better serve production. Researching and exploring the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine must rely on the leadership of the Party, understand the principle and spirit of the TCM policy put forward by the Party, meet the needs of 600 million people, integrate the essence of TCM and Western medicine, develop medical science, combine professional research with mass movements, combine scientific analysis with popularization and application, and combine academics with politics. We TCM and Western medicine practitioners must cooperate earnestly, coordinate closely, learn from each other, draw on each other's strengths, complement each other's weaknesses, jointly overcome diseases, develop medical and health undertakings, and strive to accelerate socialist construction.

    中西医合作开发祖国医学宝藏
    叶橘泉委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护李维汉副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告、周恩来总理政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告。
    江苏治疗血吸虫病  中医起了很大作用
    我是中医工作者，在中医中药工作方面向大会作一汇报。几年来，在党的中医政策鼓舞下，中西医团结合作，更好地发挥了中医的力量和作用。江苏省中医有一万七千四百零六人，参加国家医疗机构工作者有一千二百人。为了培养继承人材，省成立了中医学院一所，各专市县成立五年制的中医专科学校十所，四年制的中医学校五所，卫生学校附设中医班的十一所，中医带徒三千三百五十九人，并建立了中医医院二十四所。各市县综合医院、县人民医院都设有中医科。各市县中医当人民代表、政协委员者四百九十八人。由于党关怀人民健康、发展中医中药事业、提高中医政治地位，广大中医受到莫大的鼓舞。特别在伟大的整风运动以后，治疗晚期血吸虫病工作中，中医中药起到了很大的作用。江苏是血吸虫病严重流行区，全省七十七个县市，其中四十七个有血吸虫病流行。经普查阳性病人一百一十七万四千余人，一九五○至一九五七年治疗三十七万五千余人，一九五八年一至十月治疗七十万二千余人，共计治疗一百零七万七千余人，占阳性病人百分之九十一点三五。血防工作医务人员百分之八十是中医。全部阳性病人中丧失劳动力的晚期病人占百分之八强，约有十万左右病人不适于用锑剂注射，需要中医中药治疗。整风运动后，各级党委亲自挂帅，组织发动广大社会中医联合诊所，配合防治人员，依靠群众，开会讨论，人人动脑，个个献计，对所有晚期病人进行调查、登记、分类排队，分成腹水、痞块、黄疸、下痢等若干类型，研究制订及吸取各地经验方剂，配制丸散，下乡下社，分片包干，巡回诊疗，送药上门，便利群众，便利生产，不仅药费经济而且疗效很好。如镇江专区用消水丹、化痞丸，苏州专区用金蟾散、胃苓丸等治疗腹水痞块，疗效都在百分之七十五以上。医务人员政治思想挂了帅，在镇江现场会议交流经验后，迅速推广到各地，开展全面治疗，仅五八年六月至十一月六个月内，治疗五万八千三百人。我们在镇江专区现场会议时，到埤城乡访问病人。一个病人反映，他的大肚病十二年了，过去为了医治，卖掉了老牛并欠了很多债，病还是没有治好；现在毛主席派来医生，把药送上门来，只化了四元钱，病完全治好了，已能肩挑一百斤肥下田。他说只有搞好生产报答毛主席。有的病人因过去到处找医觅药，钱化了很多，但屡治无效，对医治已失去了信心，此次动员他们，起初不愿意治疗，经医生耐心说服劝导，还是抱着试试看的心情接受服药。许多病人经治疗后迅速改善了症状，恢复了体力，他们激动地说，只有共产党和毛主席领导，才有这样好的医生；不管刮风下雨、送上门来给我们看病，本来是打算等着死吧，共产党人民政府救了我，现在已可以参加劳动了。在治疗血吸虫病工作中，涌现出许多积极分子。老年中医师的革命干劲、忘我地劳动、感动病员合作，影响很大。体现了党的中医政策正确伟大。
    中医西医密切合作  战胜疾病造福人民
    中西医技术合作发掘祖国医学遗产。在总路线光辉照耀下，技术革命和文化革命走向高潮的今天，全国各地学习中医、应用中医、中西医合作已在各地医疗单位里掀起一个热潮。中医中药在党的领导下，已发出了光芒。通过中西医临床合作，应用中医方法治疗急慢性阑尾炎、高血压、急慢性肾脏炎、血吸虫病、肠寄生虫、小儿百日咳、麻疹、痢疾、淋巴结核、痔瘘、再生不良性贫血、骨折脱臼、毒蛇咬、血栓闭塞性脉管炎、传染性肝炎、胆道蛔虫病、流行性乙型脑炎、子宫垂脱、结石症、小儿麻痹等等，各地报道取得了显着的疗效，其中有些是目前西医西药认为难治的疾病或者须要手术治疗的疾病，用中医中药来治疗，得以免去了手术，既简便又有效，符合多快好省的方针。现在许多医院里正在组织中西合作专题研究小组向肿瘤放射病等尖端科学进军。
    大家知道，祖国医学是我国人民在长期的反复的实践中总结出来的结晶。科学来自实践。它的内容实质，无疑有科学性的精华。它在临床医学上的整体观念诊疗方法有其一定的优越性。但是它在基础医学方面，为历史条件所限，还有一定的缺陷。因此必须中西医合作整理研究。由于中西医学是两个不同的理论体系，因此研究整理应采取怎样方法，过去存在各种不同的看法。人民日报一月二十五日“认真贯彻党的中医政策”社论及时地明确地给我们指出：“我国医学遗产里面，有大量的具有科学性的精华，我们必须把这些精华认真地吸收起来，这也是发展我国新医学的必要条件。而用以发掘、整理这一座伟大宝库的手段，则是现代科学的方法”。社论并指出：忽视文化遗产的民族虚无主义倾向是不对的；认为可以离开现代科学来整理遗产，也是不对的。全国医药卫生工作者，都应该明确地认识这个问题。我们学习了社论，深深体会到只有党能领导一切科学，整理研究祖国医学遗产必须遵循着党所指示的方向，中西医紧密团结，通过临床实践，吸取它的科学精华。祖国医学建基于实践中全面观察人与大自然的关系，人体活动同疾病斗争所表现的证候，从而总结了七情六气的病因、阴阳五行营卫气血等整套的理论。这一理论是用来指导临床治疗的，因此，我个人认为可以考虑从“证候”方面进行研究、临床合作，中医按照中医理论应用复方治疗，西医按照现代医学分析观察，尽先从有显著疗效的方证着手，例如大黄牡丹皮汤治阑尾炎，四妙活血汤治血栓闭塞性脉管炎等，研究它的疗效机制。阑尾炎现代医学理论上是禁用泻药的。中医用大黄牡丹皮汤，不但不禁泻下，而且有良效。这究竟谁是谁非呢？必须通过实践，检证它的科学性。由于祖国医学的许多理论，目前还不能用现代医学来说明，只有通过实践，证明有效时，重点研究。即使暂时不明了它的机制，亦应尽快推广应用，更好地为生产服务。研究发掘祖国医学遗产，必须依靠党的领导，领会党所提出中医政策的原则精神，为六亿人民需要，融合中西医学精华，发展医药科学，专业研究与群众运动相结合，科学分析与推广应用相结合，学术与政治相结合。我们中医和西医必须认真合作，密切配合，相互学习，各取其所长，互补其所短，共同战胜疾病，发展医药卫生事业，为加速社会主义建设而奋斗。
