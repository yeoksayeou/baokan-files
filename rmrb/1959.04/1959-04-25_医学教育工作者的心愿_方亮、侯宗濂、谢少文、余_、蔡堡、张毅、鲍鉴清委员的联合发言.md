The Wishes of Medical Educators
Joint Speech by Committee Members Fang Liang, Hou Zonglian, Xie Shaowen, Yu [Unclear Character], Cai Bao, Zhang Yi, and Bao Jianqing

We completely agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. Currently, our country is flourishing in all aspects and advancing rapidly. We are all filled with joy and are determined to contribute our utmost strength to the magnificent cause of our Party and nation.

Tremendous Progress

We are medical educators from different regions across the country. Although our work positions and methods differ, the medical education work in each of our units has achieved tremendous development in the past few years. First, our respective units have established and strengthened the leading position of the Party. The vast number of teachers and students have improved their class consciousness to varying degrees through rectification and the anti-rightist struggle. Loving the Party and loving socialism has become the direction of action for the vast number of teachers and students, which has provided a political guarantee for the upsurge of medical education. Secondly, under the greatly strengthened leadership of the Party in medical education, our respective colleges and universities have implemented the policies of education serving the politics of the working class; the integration of education with productive labor; the integration of medical education with the mass health movement; and the combination of Chinese and Western medicine, thereby launching a huge and profound revolution in the medical education cause. Through this revolution, the vast number of teachers and students have established a good atmosphere of loving labor and respecting laborers, strengthened the feelings of intellectuals for workers and peasants, and promoted the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of mental and physical labor. Currently, all colleges and universities are revising teaching plans and syllabi, and improving teaching content and methods, based on the Party's policies and past experiences. In addition, a new and democratic teacher-student relationship has begun to be established in our various colleges and universities. The enthusiasm and creativity of teachers and students have greatly increased, and as a result, the quality of medical education has greatly improved. The current issue is how to rectify, consolidate, and improve on the existing basis to better implement the Party's education policy. This is the fundamental work that all of us medical educators must carry out.

In Premier Zhou's report, it was pointed out that the development of education in our country must adopt the method of combining popularization and improvement. It was also pointed out that in all levels of full-time regular schools, improving teaching quality should be taken as a regular and basic task, and we should first concentrate greater efforts on running a number of key schools well, in order to train specialized talents of higher quality for the country and rapidly promote the improvement of our country's scientific and cultural level. We believe this is completely correct.

A Suggestion

We feel that in order to meet the needs of the current state and the people, it is absolutely necessary to train a large number of politically conscious and professionally competent physicians in a short period of time. In order to achieve this goal, we suggest that in addition to continuing to run the existing five-year medical colleges well, we can also establish a number of three- or four-year medical specialty schools as possible. On the other hand, in order to train medical professionals of higher quality, we can also consider selecting a few existing five-year medical colleges with better conditions and converting them into six- or seven-year schools. In these types of schools, the theoretical courses of politics and professional skills, as well as foreign languages, should be more extensive, and students should be given more training in scientific research. At the same time, the teaching staff should also be stronger. Secondly, in order to meet the needs of the rapid development of medical education at present, it is also absolutely necessary to train a group of politically conscious and professionally competent teachers in a short period of time. In the past two years, the number of medical colleges and universities in our country has increased several times compared with the past, but the teaching staff has grown relatively slowly, which has affected the improvement of teaching quality to a greater or lesser extent. Under the current circumstances, in addition to our existing teachers actively carrying out self-transformation, strengthening on-the-job professional learning, and improving their political and professional level in order to meet the requirements of being both politically conscious and professionally competent as soon as possible, we believe that it is also necessary to systematically expand the advanced studies of teachers, and systematically select a group of medical college graduates who are politically progressive, professionally competent, healthy, and have the potential for development. Through advanced studies in advanced colleges, study in research institutes, and working as teaching assistants, etc., we can quickly train a large number of new forces to expand the existing politically conscious and professionally competent teachers, and gradually enrich the teaching staff of existing new and old medical colleges and universities.

Regarding Scientific Research

Regarding scientific research, we completely agree with Premier Zhou's point in his report that the task of directly serving construction should be placed in the primary position. Cutting-edge science and technology must also be paid attention to, and basic theoretical research must be given sufficient attention. In the past, medical scientific research often started from the individual and was divorced from production and construction. This tendency has been basically reversed, and generally, scientific research is carried out by driving disciplines with tasks. However, due to our low theoretical level and limited technical level, the further development of scientific research has been affected. We have not paid enough attention to and developed cutting-edge technologies and basic theoretical research in medicine. In order to promote the improvement of the level of medical science in our country, we must catch up in cutting-edge technologies and basic theoretical research in medicine. Using tasks to drive science is obviously not science, and not having basic theoretical scientific research is not science. Rather, theory must be combined with practice, and current needs must be combined with long-term needs. It is very necessary to appropriately carry out research work on basic medical theories. In addition, we also believe that good teaching materials are a major tool for improving teaching quality and scientific level. Therefore, the compilation of teaching materials can also be listed as a scientific research project. Under the great cooperation of various schools, relatively complete teaching materials can be compiled to improve the quality of teaching materials.

In general, we believe that under the current circumstances, medical education is mainly to carry out the work of rectification, consolidation, and improvement on the basis of past development.

Comrades, let us all medical educators, under the leadership of the Party and under the glorious illumination of the general line of socialist construction, unite closely, emit more light and heat in the great socialist medical education cause, and strive to further improve teaching quality and further implement the Party's education policy, so that our medical colleges and universities will develop day by day and become a new type of school for cultivating new people of communism!

    医学教育工作者的心愿
    方亮、侯宗濂、谢少文、余?、蔡堡、张毅、鲍鉴清委员的联合发言
    我们完全同意和一致拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和李维汉副主席的报告，现在我们的国家，各方面都在欣欣向荣，都在快步前进。我们大家都充满了愉快的心情，决心在我们党和国家壮丽的事业中，贡献出最大的力量。
    巨大的进步
    我们是来自全国不同地区的医学教育工作者，尽管我们的工作岗位不同，工作的方式也不一样，但几年来，我们所在每一单位的医学教育工作，都获得了巨大的发展。首先是我们各个单位，确立和加强了党的领导地位，广大师生，通过整风和反右，阶级觉悟都有了不同程度的提高，热爱党，热爱社会主义，已成为广大师生的行动方向，这就使医学教育的高涨，获得了政治的保证。其次是在党对医学教育的领导大大加强的条件下，我们所在各个院校都贯彻执行了教育为工人阶级的政治服务；教育和生产劳动相结合；医学教育必须和群众卫生运动相结合；以及中西医相结合的方针，从而展开了医学教育事业的巨大的、深刻的革命。通过这一革命，广大师生树立了热爱劳动和尊重劳动者的风气，加强了知识分子对工农的感情，同时也推动了理论和实际的结合，脑力劳动和体力劳动的结合。现在各个院校，都在根据党的方针和过去一些经验，修订教学计划，教学大纲，改进教学内容和教学方法。另外，在我们各个院校中，一种新的、民主的师生关系，也已经开始建立起来。教师和学生的积极性、创造性，都有很大的增涨，这样一来，医学教育的质量，就有了很大的提高。目前的问题是如何在原有的基础上，进行整顿、巩固和提高，以便更好地贯彻执行党的教育方针。这是我们所有医学教育工作者，必须进行的根本工作。
    在周总理的报告中指出，我国的教育事业的发展，必须采取普及与提高相结合的办法，同时也指出在各级全日制的正规学校中，应当把提高教学质量作为一个经常的基本任务，而且首先应当集中较大力量，办好一批重点学校，以便为国家培养更高质量的专门人才，迅速促进我国科学文化水平的提高，我们认为这是完全正确的。
    一个建议
    我们感到为了适应当前国家和人民的需要，在短期内培养出大批又红又专的医师，是完全必要的。为了达到这个目的，我们建议除了应继续办好现有五年制的医学院以外，还可以根据可能创办一批三年或四年的医学专科学校。另一方面为了培养更高质量的医学专门人才，也可以考虑选择少数条件较好的现有五年制医学院，改为六年制或七年制的学校；在这类学校中，政治与业务的理论课程以及外文，应该多一些，对学生加强一些科学研究的训练。同时，教师的力量，也要雄厚一些。其次，为了适应目前医学教育飞速发展的需要，在短期内培养出一批又红又专的教师，也是完全必要的。两年以来，我国医学院校，和过去相比增长了好几倍，而教师的队伍却增长得比较慢，因而就使教学质量的提高，或多或少地受到一些影响。在目前情况下，除了我们现有教师，应该积极进行自我改造，加强在职业务学习，提高政治与业务水平，以便早日达到又红又专的要求以外，我们认为还必须有计划地扩大教师的进修工作，有计划地选择一批政治进步，业务较好，身体健康，有发展前途的医学院毕业生，通过进修学院进修、研究院学习以及作助教等等形式，迅速培养出一大批新生力量，以扩大现有又红又专的教师，并使现有新旧医学院校的教师队伍，逐步充实起来。
    关于科学研究
    关于科学研究，我们完全同意周总理在报告中指出，直接为建设服务的任务，应该放在首要的地位。尖端科学技术，也必须注意发展，基础理论的研究，必须给以足够的重视。过去医学科学研究，往往是从个人出发，和生产建设脱节的。现在这种偏向已基本上扭转过来了，一般都是用任务来带动学科，来进行科学研究。但是由于我们理论水平不高，技术水平有限，因而影响了科学研究进一步的发展，对于医学上尖端技术以及基础理论研究，还注意和开展得很不够。为了促进我国医学科学水平的提高，我们在医学尖端技术，以及基础理论的研究上，必须迎头赶上。用任务带科学，显然不是科学，不要基础理论科学研究，而是理论必须同实际相结合，目前需要必须与长远需要相结合。适当的开展医学基础理论的研究工作是很必需的。此外，我们也认为好的教材，是提高教学质量和科学水平的一个主要工具。因此教材的编写，也可列为科学研究的一项，在各学校大协作下，编写比较完整的教材借以提高教材的质量。
    总的说来，我们认为在目前情况下，医学教育主要是在过去发展的基础上，进行整顿、巩固和提高的工作。
    同志们，让我们全体医学教育工作者，在党的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，紧密地团结起来，在伟大的社会主义医学教育事业中，发出更多的光和热，为进一步提高教学质量，进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针，使我们的医学院校日益发展，成为培养共产主义新人的新型学校而奋斗！
