    Kangba
    Kangba is a Tibetan word referring to the Tibetan people in the former Xikang Province, that is, the Tibetan people in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province today. In the summer of 1955, the reactionary upper class group in Tibet instigated the Kangba people to stage a rebellion, but it was quickly quelled. In March of this year, the armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government also attracted some Kangba rebels to participate.
    
    Shannan Region
    This region refers to the border area located southeast of Lhasa, south of the Yarlung Zangbo River, north of the Himalayas, and bordering China, India, and Bhutan. Between May and June 1958, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group instigated bandits to harass Changdu, Dingqing, Heihe, Shannan, and other regions. The bandits openly established "base areas" in Shannan and set up an airlift field in the Zhegu Zong area, accepting aid from imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek group. Now the bandit's "base area" in Shannan has been completely crushed by the People's Liberation Army.
    
    Chuanchao
    The Tibetan word "Monlam Chenmo" means Chuanchao, which is a prayer assembly and the most important religious festival in Tibet, lasting for twenty-one days. According to traditional customs, during this festival, lamas hold six gatherings every day in the famous Jokhang Temple. According to legend, the "Chuanchao Assembly" originated in the era of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school of Lamaism.
    
    Hada
    Hada is the most precious gift of the Tibetan people and also a highly skilled silk fabric, available in red, white, yellow, and blue colors, woven with religious patterns and ethnic minority characters, such as lotus flowers, treasure covers, and other religious eight treasures. There are twenty-three kinds of Hada, the highest-grade Hada is used to respect ancestors and leaders; medium-grade Hada is for relatives and friends, and the inferior Hada is pink silk, sometimes cut into squares, to be sent before borrowing something from neighbors to show respect. Another gift in Tibetan people's exchanges is called "Mandala," which is also the most precious gift, shaped like a silver pagoda.
    
    Tibetan Calendar
    Tibet has its own calendar, which is a lunar calendar. According to the Tibetan calendar, the year before last was the Fire Rooster year, last year was the Earth Dog year, and this year is the Earth Pig year. It is similar to the lunar calendar we use, with days overlapping or missing each month. For example, sometimes there are two fifths of the month or missing thirteenths. Tibetan people's activities are carried out according to the Tibetan calendar. The New Year, April 15th, July 1st, and October 25th are all important festivals of the year. There are also different local festivals in various places. Early summer and Mid-Autumn Festival are the seasons for outings. Tibetan people like to hold outdoor camping and various recreational activities during this time. Usually, their day off is Saturday instead of Sunday.

    读报常识
    康巴人
    康巴是藏语，意思就是指原西康省的藏族，即现在四川省甘孜藏族自治州一带的藏族人。1955年夏，西藏上层反动集团曾指使康巴人举行叛乱，但被迅速平息。今年3月，原西藏地方政府发动的武装叛乱也吸引了一部分康巴叛乱分子参加。
    山南地区
    这一地区指位于拉萨东南、雅鲁藏布江以南、喜马拉雅山以北、我国和印度、不丹接壤的边境地区。1958年5、6月间，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团指使叛匪窜扰昌都、丁青、黑河、山南等地区叛匪曾公开在山南建立“根据地”，在哲古宗一带设立空投场，接受帝国主义和蒋介石集团的援助。现在叛匪的山南“根据地”已经被解放军彻底粉碎。
    传召
    藏语“莫朗青布”即传召，就是祈祷大会，是西藏最隆重的宗教节期，会期二十一天。按照传统习惯，在这个节期里，喇嘛们每天在著名的大昭寺举行六次集会。据传说：“传召大会”始于喇嘛教的黄教祖师宗喀巴时代。
    哈达
    哈达是藏族最珍贵的礼品，也是一种工艺水平很高的丝织品，颜色分红、白、黄、蓝四种，上面织有宗教图案和少数民族文字，如莲花、宝盖等宗教的八宝纹样。哈达共有二十三种，最高级的哈达是官佛像、佛字文帕，用来敬祖先和领袖；中等哈达敬亲戚朋友，次等的哈达是粉绢，有的裁成对方，向邻居借东西时先送一块，表示敬意。藏族人民交往的礼品中还有一种叫“满札”的，也是最珍贵的礼品，形状似银塔。
    藏历
    西藏有自己的历法，是太阴历。根据藏历算法，前年是火鸡年，去年是土狗年，今年是土猪年。和我们所用农历大同小异，每月的日子有重有缺。如有时有两个初五或缺十三等。藏民活动都是按照藏历进行。一年中新年、4月15、7月初1、10月25，都是重要节日。各地也有不同的地方节日。初夏和中秋是郊游的季节。藏民喜欢在这个时期举行郊外露营和各种文娱活动。平时，他们的休假日是星期六而不是星期日。
