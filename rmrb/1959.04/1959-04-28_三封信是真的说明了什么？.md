All Sorts of Lies Completely Bankrupt

To the Editor:

Mr. Nehru's admission that the three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan were written by the Dalai Lama himself completely bankrupts the various lies fabricated by Indian expansionists against our country. This proves that the so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" circulated by Indian officials is entirely fabricated, and that the circulation of this statement is obviously malicious and conceals ulterior motives.

Isn't the Indian expansionists' support for Tibetan rebels and their demand that China reconsider its "measures in Tibet" a blatant violation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and a crude interference in our internal affairs? These people also say that according to old agreements between the British and the Chinese, the British enjoyed a "monopoly right" to develop Tibet, and that after India's independence, "India became the successor to this monopoly right." Isn't this a naked expression of the Indian expansionists' ambition to inherit the mantle of imperialism and continue their aggressive activities against Tibet?

Recently, with the connivance of the Indian police, Indian expansionists openly insulted Chairman Mao, the great leader of our 600 million people. This is an insult to our 600 million people. We demand that the Indian government formally apologize to our country and severely punish these thugs. If the Indian expansionists harbor malicious intentions and insist on going their own way, the patience of the Chinese people is limited, and the Indian expansionists shall be responsible for all consequences.

Since the Three Letters are Genuine,
Then the Two Statements are False

To the Editor:

These days, we have been constantly angered by the political ambitions and shameless tactics of the Indian expansionists.

Since Prime Minister Nehru has admitted that the three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan are genuine, this is an admission of the fact that the Dalai Lama was abducted.

Some Indian politicians have expressed doubts about the three letters published by our country and have launched a campaign to slander New China. Now, the basis for these slanders has vanished. Prime Minister Nehru's admission is equivalent to a slap in the face to the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." Since the three letters are genuine, isn't the so-called statement, which is completely contrary to the content of the three letters, completely false?

We believe that this hostile and malicious political document circulated by Indian diplomatic officials is a serious incident. This is not only unfriendly to our country, but also a slanderous political attack.

We are particularly outraged by the incident in which Indian reactionaries insulted our leader under the protection of the Indian police. This is a great insult to the Chinese people, and we express our strongest protest.

### 三封信是真的说明了什么？

    三封信是真的说明了什么？
    种种谎言彻底破产编辑同志：
    尼赫鲁先生承认了达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信是达赖喇嘛亲笔写的，这就使印度扩张主义分子诬蔑我国的种种谎言彻底破产。这证明了由印度官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”彻头彻尾是假造的，散发这个声明显然是别有用心，隐藏着不可告人的目的。
    印度扩张主义分子支持西藏叛匪，要求中国重新考虑“对西藏的措施”，这些不是违反和平共处五项原则、干涉我国内政的粗暴的表现吗？这些人还说，根据英国人和中国人之间的旧协定，英国享有发展西藏的“垄断权利”，在印度独立以后，“印度成为这个垄断权利的继承者”，这不是赤裸裸地表现了印度扩张主义分子想继承帝国主义的衣钵，对西藏继续进行侵略活动的野心吗？
    最近，在印度警察的纵容下，印度扩张主义分子竟公然侮辱我国六亿人民的伟大领袖毛主席，这是对我国六亿人民的侮辱。我们要求印度政府正式向我国道歉，严惩这些暴徒。如果印度扩张主义分子心怀不善，一意孤行到底，中国人民的忍耐是有限度的，一切后果应由印度扩张主义分子负责。
    国家科委“创造与发明”编辑部全体人员三封信既然是真的
    两个声明就是假的编辑同志：
    这些天来，我们一直被印度扩张主义分子的政治野心和无耻手段所激怒。
    尼赫鲁总理既然承认了达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信是真实的，这就承认了达赖喇嘛是被劫持的这一事实。
    印度的一些政治家曾对我国发表的这三封信表示怀疑，并掀起了诬蔑新中国的运动。现在，这些诬蔑的根据成为泡影了。尼赫鲁总理的这一承认，也就等于打了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”一记巴掌。既然三封信是真的，那末，与三封信的内容完全相反的所谓声明不是完全假的吗？
    我们认为，印度外交官员散发的这一敌对性的、别有用心的政治文件是一个严重事件，这不仅是对我国的不友好，而且是一种诬蔑性的政治攻击。
    对于印度反动分子在印度警察包庇下侮辱我国领袖这一事件，我们尤为愤怒。这是对中国人民的极大侮辱，我们表示最强硬的抗议。
