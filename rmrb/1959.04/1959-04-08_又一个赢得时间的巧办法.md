    Another Clever Way to Save Time
    The Dama People's Commune in Tongxiang County, Zhejiang Province, used greenhouse steam to cultivate rice seedlings, which allowed them to transplant early rice more than twenty days earlier than neighboring areas. This is another example of using clever methods to save time. The ingenuity of this lies not only in the "early" aspect. It also allows for proactive scheduling of seedling emergence dates and reduces the labor required for tending rice paddies. Therefore, during the busy season when field management of summer crops and early rice transplanting are crammed together, the commune's various productions are not as chaotic as in previous years during this period.
    Technically speaking, there is another benefit to this method: it can avoid seedling rot, and the seedlings have strong cold resistance, turn green early, and develop strong roots. Judging from these characteristics, this seedling cultivation method has another great use at present. This year, early rice has been sown relatively early in various places, and due to continuous cold waves, seedling rot is serious in some areas, and replanting with ordinary rice paddies may delay the transplanting period. In this case, it is a good time to try using greenhouse steam seedling cultivation method to cultivate seedlings.
    Steam seedling cultivation is a new seedling cultivation method, and everyone is not yet familiar with its specific operating techniques. Various places can first conduct small-scale experiments, and consider promoting it after gaining experience.

    又一个赢得时间的巧办法
    浙江桐乡县大麻公社采用温室蒸气育秧，使早稻插秧比附近地区提早二十多天。这是用巧办法赢得时间的又一个事例。这件事做得巧妙，还不光在“早”字上。它还使出秧日期可以主动安排，使侍弄秧田的劳力可以节省。因此，在夏收作物的田间管理和早稻插秧等等工作挤在一起的繁忙的季节里，这个社的各项生产也不像往年这个时期那样忙乱。
    这样做从技术上说来还有一个好处：可以避免烂秧，而且秧苗抗寒力强，转青早，发棵壮实。从这些特征来看，这种育秧方法在目前又有一个很大的用处。今年各地早稻播种都比较早，由于寒潮不断地侵袭，有些地区烂秧情况严重，用一般秧田补播可能要延误插秧期。在这情况下，正好可以试用温室蒸气育秧法来培育秧苗。
  蒸气育秧是一项新的育秧方法，它的具体操作技术大家还不熟悉，各地可以先作小型试验，待取得经验后再考虑推广。
