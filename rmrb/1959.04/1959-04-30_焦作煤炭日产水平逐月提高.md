Jiaozuo, April 29th (By our newspaper) After overfulfilling the first quarter's raw coal production plan seven days ahead of schedule, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has won an initial victory in the decisive second quarter. By the 27th, it had overfulfilled the state plan by 6,393 tons three days ahead of schedule. Compared with March, the daily output level increased by 11.84%, the overall efficiency increased by 20.69%, the timber consumption decreased by 6.75%, and the raw coal cost decreased by 11%.
    The reason why this bureau was able to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in April is, first of all, on the basis of the victory in the comprehensive Red Flag competition in March, it continued to carry out a large-scale bumper harvest movement in depth. The average monthly output of new mining faces in the bureau exceeded 10,000 tons, and two-thirds reached a high bumper harvest level of 15,000 tons. Secondly, the masses were fully mobilized to hand over tasks and methods, formulate measures, and grasp the plan on a daily and ten-day basis to achieve balanced production. Thirdly, technical innovations were made and a technical revolution was carried out, promoting the advanced mining experiences put forward by the Ministry of Coal Industry. In order to better and more comprehensively complete the task, on the basis of the implementation of the plan, the mine is further carrying out a "three highs, two lows, and one guarantee" (high yield, high quality, high efficiency; low cost, low consumption; guarantee safety) increase production and conserve resources movement centered on technical innovation. All workers in the district are working harder and more skillfully to greet Red May and are determined to fight another great victory.
    Xinhua News Agency: The Hongshan Coal Mine Washing Plant, which has overfulfilled its tasks every month since the beginning of this year, has also overfulfilled the state's refined coal production plan for April one week ahead of schedule. At present, all the workers in the plant are advancing victoriously and striving to increase the production of refined coal by 6,000 to 7,000 tons for the country by the end of this month.
    The Hongshan Coal Mine Washing Plant is one of the eighteen key washing plants in China. Its task is to provide refined coal for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation. The 65,328 tons of refined coal produced in the first quarter were mostly transported to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation. Since entering the second quarter, the enthusiasm of all the workers in the plant has been even greater. The three shifts are chasing each other, and the production competition is in full swing. While tapping the potential of mechanical equipment, they also pay attention to improving the utilization rate of working hours, thereby ensuring the rapid increase in the output of refined coal.

    焦作煤炭日产水平逐月提高
    本报焦作29日电　焦作矿务局在提前七天超额完成第一季度原煤生产计划之后，又在决定性的第二季度里，初战告捷，至27日，已提前三天超额六千三百九十三吨完成国家计划。与三月比较，日产水平提高11.84％，全员效率提高20.69％，坑木消耗降低6.75％，原煤成本降低11％。
    这个局4月份所以能够全面跃进，首先是在3月份全面开展红旗竞赛取得胜利的基础上，继续深入开展大面积丰产运动，全局新采工作面平均月产突破万吨，有三分之二达到一万五千吨高额丰产水平。其次，充分发动群众，交任务、交办法，订措施，按日按旬抓计划，做到均衡生产。其三，技术革新大闹技术革命，推广了煤炭部提出的采掘先进经验。为了更好更全面地完成任务，在计划落实的基础上，这个矿正进一步开展以技术革新为中心的“三高，二低，一保证”
  （高产，高质，高效；成本低，消耗低；保证安全）的增产节约运动，全区职工劲上加劲，巧上加巧，迎接红五月，决心再打大胜仗。
    新华社讯　今年以来月月超额完成任务的洪山煤矿洗选厂，4月份的国家精煤生产计划又提前一周超额完成。目前全厂职工正在乘胜前进，力争在本月末再为国家增产六千到七千吨精煤。
    洪山煤矿洗选厂是我国现有十八个重点洗选厂之一，它的任务是为武钢提供精煤，第一季度生产的六万五千三百二十八吨精煤，绝大部分都运往了武钢。进入第二季度以来，全厂职工的干劲更大，三班你追我赶，生产竞赛如火如荼。他们在大挖机械设备潜力的同时，还注意提高工时利用率，从而保证了精煤产量的迅速上升。
