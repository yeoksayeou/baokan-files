By integrating specializations with production and conducting scientific research within the production process, the Chengdu Institute of Technology has significantly improved its teaching quality.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Chengdu Institute of Technology, based on the experience of implementing the Party's education policy since last year, has comprehensively and appropriately arranged teaching, labor, and scientific research work according to the characteristics of different specializations and grades, organically combining these three aspects of work to promote the improvement of teaching quality.

    This comprehensive arrangement of teaching, labor, and scientific research by the Chengdu Institute of Technology is based on the experience gained from implementing the Party's education policy since last year. In terms of time allocation, all five departments in the institute basically follow the system of one month of vacation, three months of labor, and eight months of teaching per year, and appropriately concentrate the labor time to enable students to participate in production labor that is systematically related to their major. During the labor period, the departments interspersed a small amount of teaching time to enable teachers and students to conduct on-site teaching in conjunction with labor; while during the teaching period, they interspersed some labor time to enable students to cultivate labor perspectives and apply their acquired knowledge in a timely manner through regular labor. In addition, the specific arrangements for labor time for each major vary according to the teaching requirements of each major, the nature of teachers and students' participation in labor, the labor location, and the construction season. For example, the Department of Chemical Engineering mainly engages in labor in the on-campus factory, so they divide the year into three semesters: two semesters of theoretical teaching and one semester of labor, while also learning a course closely related to labor. Each grade alternates between labor and teaching to facilitate unified arrangements for the entire system. The labor locations for teachers and students in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering and the Department of Civil Engineering are water conservancy or construction sites, so these two departments centrally arrange labor time during the dry season when there is a large amount of construction. At the same time, each department arranges a certain amount of scientific research work during the labor or teaching period according to the conditions of each grade and the needs of teaching and production. For example, the Department of Electrical Engineering integrates scientific research into the experimental and design aspects of the teaching process, or, after studying several courses, organizes teachers and students into special topic groups for research activities related to the courses for a concentrated period of time.

    During the arrangements, each specialization pays special attention to the internal connections between teaching, labor, and scientific research, so that these three aspects are organically combined with teaching as the center. For example, the basic organic synthesis specialization of the Department of Chemical Engineering has made different arrangements for the teaching and labor of each grade according to this principle. First-year students only participate in simpler labor related to the manufacturing of chemical machinery; third-year students are required to independently master the operational techniques of a production process in a comprehensive chemical plant, consolidate and apply the knowledge of physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, and other fields they have learned, and study relevant parts of the courses on mechanical parts and industrial chemistry in conjunction with labor; fourth-year students need to participate in labor in larger-scale professional factories outside the school to comprehensively apply the knowledge they have learned and collect materials for graduation design.

    In order to achieve the close integration of teaching, labor, and scientific research, the Institute of Technology implements the principle of combining on-campus and off-campus bases in the establishment and selection of labor bases, with each specialization making flexible arrangements according to its own needs. The Department of Hydraulic Engineering and the Department of Civil Engineering mainly select water conservancy projects or construction sites that meet teaching requirements. The Department of Machinery, the Department of Electrical Engineering, and the Department of Chemical Engineering mainly focus on establishing on-campus bases to better meet the needs of teaching and scientific research; at the same time, they also establish off-campus internship bases to help students expand their scope of production knowledge and make up for the shortcomings of on-campus bases.

    Through such comprehensive and meticulous arrangements, the Chengdu Institute of Technology has now seen a situation of close integration of teaching, labor, and scientific research, with vigorous development. A large number of teachers and students from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering, the Department of Machinery, the Department of Chemical Engineering, and the Department of Civil Engineering have gone to factories and construction sites to carry out labor and on-site teaching; some students who have returned from on-site teaching are now engaging in systematic theoretical study with greater enthusiasm, and the quality of teaching has been significantly improved.

### 按专业结合生产在生产中进行科学研究  成都工学院教学质量显著提高

　　按专业结合生产在生产中进行科学研究
　　成都工学院教学质量显著提高
    本报讯　成都工学院按照各种不同专业和年级的特点，全面妥善的安排教学、劳动和科学研究工作，使这三方面的工作有机地结合，促进教学质量的提高。
    成都工学院这次对教学、劳动和科学研究工作的全面安排，是根据去年以来贯彻党的教育方针的经验进行的。在时间安排上，全院五个系都基本执行每年放假一个月、劳动三个月和教学八个月的制度，并把劳动时间适当集中，以便学生比较系统的参加结合自己所学专业的生产劳动。在劳动期间，各系穿插了少量的教学时间，使师、生能够结合劳动进行现场教学；而在教学期间，又穿插一些劳动时间，使学生能通过经常性劳动培养劳动观点和及时运用学得的知识。此外，各个专业劳动时间的具体安排，根据各专业教学要求、师生参加劳动的性质、劳动场所和施工季节的不同，又各有差异。比如，化工系主要在校内工厂劳动，他们就将全年分为三学期，两学期理论教学；一学期参加劳动，并学习一门与劳动紧密联系的课程。各年级交插进行劳动和教学，以便全系统一安排。水利、土木两系师、生的劳动场所，是水利或建筑工地，这两个系就在大量施工的枯水季节集中安排劳动时间。同时，各系在劳动或教学期中，都按各年级的条件和教学、生产需要，安排一定的科学研究工作。如电机系把科学研究安排到教学过程的实验、设计等环节中，或在学习若干课程后，集中一段时间，由师、生组成专题小组进行与课程相联系的研究活动。
    在进行安排时，各专业特别注意教学、劳动和科学研究的内在联系，使这三方面以教学为中心有机地结合起来。如化工系基本有机合成专业就按这原则对各年级教学和劳动作了不同安排。一年级只参加化工机械制造方面较简单的劳动；三年级要求独立掌握综合化工厂一种生产过程的操作技术，巩固和运用已学的物理化学、分析化学等方面的知识，并结合劳动学习机械零件和工业化学两门课的有关部分；四年级学生则需要到校外规模较大的专业工厂参加劳动，以便全面运用已学的知识，同时为毕业设计搜集资料。
    为了实现教学、劳动和科学研究的紧密结合，在劳动基地的建立和选择上，工学院实行了校内与校外基地并举的原则，由各专业按本身需要灵活安排。水利、土木两系主要选择切合教学需要的水利工程或建筑工地。机械、电机、化工三系则以建立校内基地为主，以便更好的满足教学和科学研究的需要；同时，也要在校外建立实习基地，帮助学生扩大生产知识范围，弥补校内基地之不足。
    经过这样全面细致的安排，现在，成都工学院已出现教学、劳动和科学研究紧密结合、蓬勃开展的局面。水利、机械、化工、土木等系大批师生已下到工厂工地进行劳动和现场教学；一些结束现场教学归来的学生，正以更高的热情进行系统的理论学习，教学质量有了显著提高。
