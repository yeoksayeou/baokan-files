This conference was a challenge and response meeting for the nationwide postal and telecommunications departments to launch a "one-stop" large-scale collaboration competition campaign. Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo spoke at the meeting. Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Wang Zigang also spoke at the meeting. In his speech, Wang Zigang pointed out that the national postal and telecommunications system is an organic whole, and it is necessary to strengthen collaboration and maintain the unity and integrity of the communications organization. Li Jinghan, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, also spoke at the meeting.

Representatives from the Beijing Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau, the City Telephone Bureau, the Post Office, and the Hebei Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, among other units, put forward specific goals and proposed to carry out friendship competitions with fraternal units. Representatives from the Shanghai and Liaoning postal and telecommunications departments immediately responded to the challenge at the meeting. The Beijing Post Office set the goal of ensuring that there would be no omissions or misdeliveries of mail and newspapers, and no loss or damage; ensuring that newspapers, under normal publication conditions, would be delivered to readers in the urban area by 7:00 AM, except in the suburbs. The Shanghai Post Office said in response to the challenge that they would guarantee to deliver the central newspapers whenever they arrived at the post office. The Beijing Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau proposed to ensure that the utilization rate of telephones would be increased to more than 95%. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau proposed in response to the challenge to completely eliminate errors in telegram services, and to deliver all received telegrams to the recipients within 30 minutes after they were fully translated.

During the telephone conference, telegrams and telephone calls were also received from sixteen cities and counties including Fuzhou and Hohhot, all of whom put forward challenge and response conditions.
