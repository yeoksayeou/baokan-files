Minority Areas in Yunnan Producing Medicinal Materials
Mobilize People of All Ethnic Groups to Plant Medicinal Materials

(Our report) The Wen Shan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, and the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province are mobilizing people of all ethnic groups to vigorously plant medicinal materials during this time of spring warmth and sufficient moisture.

Yunnan Province is extremely rich in medicinal materials, with more than 500 varieties. Among them, the precious medicinal materials include Wenshan's notoginseng, and the bear bile, musk, tiger bone, and deer antler from Lijiang, Dali, and other places. Those produced in larger quantities include Dioscorea hemsleyi, poria cocos, Aucklandia lappa, Pinellia ternata, Angelica sinensis, and safflower.

In developing the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials, on the one hand, unified planning and comprehensive arrangements are implemented; on the other hand, cadres from agriculture, forestry, and health departments are organized to plant experimental plots of medicinal materials to help the masses summarize and promote planting experience. For example, in the Wenshan Autonomous Prefecture, which is rich in notoginseng, the yield was only about 40 jin per mu in the past, but now, with the adoption of advanced cultivation methods such as deep plowing and careful cultivation, and reasonable close planting, it is estimated that each mu can produce 400 jin based on the current planting and growth conditions. Previously, the masses believed that it could only be planted in Wenshan, but now it has also been planted in Tengchong, Honghe, and other places. The province plans to plant more than 10,000 mu, an eightfold increase compared to last year. At the same time, a general survey of wild medicinal materials in the mountainous areas has been conducted. To date, more than 100 new medicinal materials have been discovered, including subtropical medicines that previously relied on external supply, such as Terminalia chebula, Piper longum, catechu, amomum villosum, Achyranthes bidentata, Rauvolfia verticillata, and Dioscorea hemsleyi.

Currently, in various parts of Yunnan, 56 types of wild medicinal materials are being converted to domestic cultivation, including Paeonia lactiflora, Kaempferia galanga, Ligusticum sinense, Scutellaria baicalensis, Coptis chinensis, Aucklandia lappa, sika deer, and musk deer. Twenty-three types, including Gastrodia elata and Rauvolfia verticillata, have already been planted. All regions have included medicinal material production as one of the sideline incomes. People's communes, management districts, and production teams have organized a certain amount of labor for medicinal material production in combination with the local natural conditions. Special areas and states have also established medicinal material bases to cultivate various medicinal materials on a trial basis.

    云南出产药材的少数民族地区
    发动各族人民种植药材
    本报讯　云南省文山僮族苗族自治州、大理白族自治州、怒江傈僳族自治州，发动各族人民，乘春暖墒饱时候，大力种植药材。
    云南省出产药材极为丰富，共有五百多种。其中名贵的药材有文山的三七；丽江、大理等地的熊胆、麝香、虎骨、鹿茸，产量较大的有黄山药、茯苓、吴芋、木香、半夏、当归、红花等。
    在发展中药材生产中，一面实行统一计划，全面安排，一面组织农业、林业、医药卫生部门干部种药材试验田，帮助群众总结推广种植经验。如在盛产三七的文山自治州，过去每亩只能产四十斤左右，现在采用深耕细作、合理密植的先进耕作方法，根据现在的种植、生长情况，预计每亩能产四百斤；原先群众认为只能在文山种，现在腾冲、红河等地也下了种。全省计划种植一万多亩，种植面积比去年扩大八倍。与此同时，还对山区的野生药材进行了普查，到目前为止，先后共发现了一百多种新药材，其中有过去一向都靠外地供应的亚热带药物，如柯子、荜茇、儿茶、砂仁、膝黄、萝芙木、黄山药等。
    现在，云南各地把野生药材改为家种家养的有白芍、三奈、云风、黄芩、黄莲、吴芋、马鹿、獐子等五十六种；现已下种的有天麻、萝芙木等二十三种。各地区都将药材生产列入副业收入之一，人民公社、管理区，生产队都结合各地的自然条件，组织一定的劳动力进行药材生产，各专区和州还建立了药材基地，试种培植各种药材。
