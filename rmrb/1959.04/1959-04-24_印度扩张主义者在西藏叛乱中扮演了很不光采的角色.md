Speech by Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Resources and Electric Power

Chairman, fellow representatives, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 state final accounts and the 1959 state budget draft, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. Now, I would like to make a simple speech on the work of water resources and electric power and some of my personal experiences.

The Unprecedented Development of Water Conservancy and Electric Power Projects; Water Conservancy Projects Have Played a Certain Role in the Great Agricultural Harvest

In last year's nationwide Great Leap Forward, the water conservancy and electric power industries, like other industries, achieved unprecedented development and leap forward. In terms of water conservancy construction, hundreds of millions of people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, displayed infinite wisdom and soaring enthusiasm. Their heroic words were: "Commanding ten thousand rivers and mountains, directing the Jade Emperor and the Dragon King," "Exchanging a few years of hard work for ten thousand years of happiness." In 1958, the nation completed 58 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, expanded the irrigated area by 480 million mu, preliminarily controlled the waterlogged area of 210 million mu, and initially controlled the soil erosion area of 320,000 square kilometers. New progress has also been made in the governance and development preparation work of major rivers such as the Huai River, Yellow River, Hai River, Yangtze River, Pearl River, Liao River, and Songhua River. Such a development speed and construction scale of China's water conservancy construction have created a miracle in the history of world water conservancy construction. (Applause)

As everyone knows, in the first half of 1958, many regions in China, such as Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, Anhui, Hubei, and Guangxi, experienced droughts of varying degrees. Since the autumn, the Yellow River, Han River, and other rivers have had considerable floods, and relatively concentrated rainstorms have occurred in eastern Hebei, southern Shandong, and western Henan. Thanks to the heroic struggle of the broad masses of the people in fighting drought and flood prevention, coupled with the role of projects built over the years, especially last year, drought and flood disasters were greatly reduced, and the extraordinary floods of the Yellow River and Han River were overcome. Water conservancy projects played a certain role in last year's great agricultural harvest.

In terms of the electric power industry, the total power generation in 1958 reached 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 42 percent over 1957; the newly added installed capacity was 1.79 million kilowatts, an increase of 1.4 times over 1957, equivalent to more than two-thirds of the total newly added installed capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period. In addition, rural power stations have about 130,000 kilowatts. This is the year with the fastest development speed of China's electric power industry since liberation. Although the growth of China's electric power industry last year could not fully adapt to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, it basically guaranteed the electricity needs of industrial production with steel as the key link and laid the foundation for the continued leap forward of the electric power industry this year.

The ability of water conservancy and electric power construction to achieve such great achievements is the victory of the Party's general line for building socialism, the victory of the nationwide rectification movement, the victory of the arduous struggle of the broad masses and water conservancy and electric power workers, and it is also inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. (Warm applause)

In 1959, there are a total of 28 water conservancy basic construction projects above the national quota under construction, and the irrigated area of farmland water conservancy will be expanded by 100 million mu. There are a total of 184 new and expanded basic construction projects for water and thermal power stations above the quota, which is more than the total number of all electric power industry projects above the quota during the First Five-Year Plan period; this year's planned annual power generation is 40 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 45 percent over 1958, which is a plan for a continued Great Leap Forward. (Applause)

To accomplish this plan, we need to make great efforts. Here, I would like to talk about the following issues:

	1. In recent years, although we have done a lot of work in water conservancy and have played a great role in alleviating China's historical water and drought disasters, it must be pointed out that water and drought disasters have not been completely resolved, and to date, many regions are still threatened by water and drought disasters. Therefore, we must adhere to the spirit of "planning for the worst and striving for the best" to strive to prevent serious floods and droughts this year.

	The current situation is that the flood control and drainage capacity of the rivers that have been harnessed has been greatly improved, and safety can be guaranteed under general flood conditions. However, before the complete completion of the fundamental treatment projects, the major rivers still rely mainly on dikes for water retention, and the flood control effectiveness is still limited. It is still impossible to completely control larger floods or extraordinarily large floods that may occur.

	In some areas of the Northwest, North China, and Northeast China, due to less rainfall and insufficient water sources, the amount of water in each year is extremely unstable, and droughts of varying degrees have occurred continuously in the past; in the southern regions, although water resources are relatively abundant, the drought resistance standards of water conservancy projects in many regions are still very low. If it does not rain for dozens of days, water shortages will occur. In the rainy season, mountainous areas are often threatened by mountain floods.

	Therefore, while continuing to carry out river management and widely developing mass water conservancy construction, vigorously strengthening flood prevention, drought prevention, and drainage work is still an arduous task for a relatively long period in the future.

	2. China's electric power industry has already developed quite rapidly, but it is still a relatively weak link in the development of the entire national economy. In the arrangement of this year's plan, the state has strived to improve the production targets of electric power according to possible conditions and has stipulated the task of vigorously manufacturing power generation equipment. We believe that with the continuous improvement of China's motor manufacturing capacity, the situation where the electric power industry cannot fully adapt to the rapid development of the national economy will gradually change in the future. In order to complete this year's task, we must strive to generate electricity as soon as possible for new power stations on the premise of ensuring quality; for existing equipment, we must strive to generate more electricity and supply more electricity on the premise of ensuring safe operation; in places where there is already a shortage of electricity and where a shortage is imminent, we must vigorously carry out the movement to save electricity and also carry out the "small, indigenous, and mass" power generation movement.

	3. Regarding the issue of hydropower construction, the two hydropower stations in Fengman, Jilin, and Shizitan, Sichuan, both encountered special dry years last year, and power generation decreased significantly after the fourth quarter, so some people have different understandings of the development of hydropower. We believe that it is the characteristic of hydropower stations to generate more electricity in wet years and less electricity in dry years. However, the special drought of Fengman and Shizitan hydropower stations last year was a phenomenon that occurs once in many years. This issue was anticipated in the design of the power stations and can be properly arranged in operation and management. China's hydropower resources are very abundant, and the development conditions are also very favorable. In particular, the major rivers have serious flood disasters, and many large-scale control water conservancy hub projects must be built. In order to make full use of water resources, these projects should be comprehensive utilization projects for flood control, power generation, and irrigation. Therefore, in addition to vigorously developing thermal power, hydropower must also be vigorously developed.

The Great Leap Forward of 1958 Gave the Imperialists and Reactionaries a Loud Slap in the Face

In the past two years, because I have been ill, I have rarely participated in specific work. That’s all I have to say about the work of water conservancy and electric power. Now I will talk about some of my personal thoughts and experiences.

During the four-year term of the First National People's Congress, major changes have taken place in our motherland's construction and the world situation. As Premier Zhou said in the government work report, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have already achieved brilliant achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the struggle between the two roads, socialism has basically defeated capitalism. Due to the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan, China has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. On this basis, in 1958, China experienced an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in the national economy. The 1959 national economic plan is still a plan for a continued Great Leap Forward. At the same time, the Soviet Union is carrying out a magnificent seven-year plan for the comprehensive development of communist construction. It is entirely certain that in a not-too-long historical period, the Soviet Union will surpass the United States in terms of per capita production levels, and China will also become an advanced major industrial country. The entire socialist camp will significantly surpass the imperialist camp in terms of material production, thereby fully guaranteeing world peace. Everyone sees, the achievements we have already made and the ideals that are about to be realized are such an exciting, magnificent picture! (Warm applause)

The imperialists and reactionaries have always looked at us with a gloating subjective wish. But the development of things is always contrary to their wishes. When we went through a production upsurge in 1956 and carried out rectification and consolidation in 1957, the imperialists and reactionaries foolishly laughed and said that our economy had encountered great difficulties and could not survive. The answer to this gloating of the imperialists and reactionaries was the Great Leap Forward in 1958, when our steel, grain, and cotton production doubled, giving them a loud slap in the face. (Warm applause)

In that "unusual spring" of 1957, the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and the people. The imperialists and reactionaries thought that China was in great chaos and hurriedly cheered these people on. But what was the result? Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the whole country thoroughly defeated the rightists' attack. Right and wrong became clearer, the people's awareness was further raised, the Party's leadership was further consolidated, and the people's democratic united front, led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance, was further consolidated and expanded. The number of members of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC was 729, and this session has increased to 1,071. Some rightists who expressed their willingness to repent have also been nominated as members. Now, the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the First Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC are being held at the same time. More than 2,000 representatives from all ethnic groups and social strata from all over the country are gathered here to summarize the great achievements of China's socialist construction and mobilize the people of the whole country to realize this year's continued Great Leap Forward. This is truly a conference of great unity of the people and a conference of the Great Leap Forward. The great chaos in China that the imperialists and reactionaries had hoped for has thus failed. The relationship between the broad masses of intellectuals and the Party has not become estranged but closer. Many advanced elements among them have become glorious Communist Party members and have entered the ranks of the advanced proletariat. (Applause)

The imperialists and reactionaries often gloat when they see that we have some difficulties. They do not understand that our difficulties are fundamentally different from the difficulties of capitalist countries. The difficulties of capitalist countries are difficulties in decline, getting deeper and deeper. Our difficulties are difficulties in development and difficulties in progress. We can overcome any difficulties, and after overcoming difficulties, there will be a great victory. Isn't the above fact enough to illustrate this point? (Warm applause)

"In 1958, a new social organization emerged on the vast horizon of eastern Asia like a rising sun. This is the large-scale, worker-peasant-commerce-study-military integrated, government-commune integrated people's commune in our country's rural areas. As soon as it appeared, it attracted widespread attention with its powerful vitality." However, the imperialists and reactionaries have not relaxed their slander and attacks on this great creation of the Chinese people. In fact, our rural people's communes have been established for less than a year and have already shown their great superiority in all aspects. Even from the perspective of water conservancy, its superiority is very obvious. Water conservancy requires collective management, and only overall planning can fully utilize water and soil resources. After cooperation, especially after communization, the land is connected into large areas, labor can be rationally allocated, and the contradictions between the interests of water storage and drainage upstream and downstream, left and right banks can be taken into consideration on a larger scale. It integrates reservoirs, canals, ponds, and wells, connecting them into a complete set of water storage, water transportation, and water use systems. Barren mountains, hills, plains, and saline-alkali depressions have been transformed, making the best use of the land and maximizing its effectiveness in production. In the use of labor in the commune, it can be divided or combined, which can give full play to the characteristics of professional teams and can also carry out seasonal assaults. The commune can not only develop a variety of economies such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, but also can run various processing industries it needs. The gentlemen of capitalist countries all understand that large factories are more efficient and more profitable than small factories; large farms are more efficient and more profitable than small farms. The characteristics of our people's communes are large-scale and public ownership. Under collective management, the same land and the same labor can increase production exponentially. However, we have a fundamental difference from capitalist countries, that is, in capitalist countries, the vast majority of the profits are plundered by capitalists and manor lords, while with us, everything belongs to the people. The more the commune's production develops and the more the income increases, the part distributed to the commune members according to their labor will also increase correspondingly year by year. I recently visited several people's communes, and their planned total output value for 1959 increased by two-thirds compared to last year, and some doubled. In 1958, more than 90 percent of the commune members increased their income, and the rest were no lower than the 1957 level, and they also achieved free meals. Whether men, women, old, or young, regardless of whether they have labor power, have received the most reliable social insurance. This year, with the development of production, the total income of each commune member and his family will definitely increase greatly. Only a few percent of the total income of the commune is used to run collective welfare undertakings, which can achieve "the elderly are provided for, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, lonely, and disabled are all cared for." Are our people's communes good or not? I say very good! More than 600 million people across the country say very good! No matter what the imperialists and reactionaries say, our people's communes will inevitably become increasingly prosperous. (Long and enthusiastic applause)

In the Tibetan Rebellion, Prime Minister Nehru Should Make Wise Decisions Based on the Principles of Friendly Coexistence

Recently, the reactionary elements of the upper strata of the former Tibetan local government, under the instigation and incitement of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and foreign reactionaries, openly tore up the seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, launched an armed rebellion, and attempted to split the unity of the motherland and undermine national unity. As everyone knows, Tibet is an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China, and the Tibetan people are members of the big family of the motherland. This is a historically affirmed fact for thousands of years, which even the imperialists cannot deny. The serious crime of the reactionary elements of the upper strata of the former Tibetan local government in betraying the motherland, undermining unity, and undermining national unity is not allowed by the people of all ethnic groups in the country, including the patriotic people of Tibet. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of monks and lay people in Tibet, has quickly quelled the rebellion in Lhasa and other major areas. This incident once again proves that the imperialists and reactionaries are always unwilling to accept our victory and always try to create some problems within us. But these conspiracies are destined to fail. Because society must move forward, the people demand improved lives, and the advanced must replace the backward. This is the general trend, and no one can stop it. Those upper-level elements who are connected with the old system, if they can conform to this trend, everyone has a bright future. If they violate this trend, they will inevitably be abandoned by the people. The seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet is conducive to the unity of the motherland, is beneficial to the Tibetan people, and has made appropriate considerations for the upper-level elements in Tibet. With the rapid development of socialist construction in the motherland, the Tibetan people and progressive upper and middle strata urgently demand democratic reform, development of production, and improvement of life. The Central People's Government, in order to give the upper echelons in Tibet sufficient time for consideration, has repeatedly persuaded the people to wait patiently. However, those reactionary upper-level elements do not know happiness in happiness, do not understand this kindness of tolerance and waiting, but think that we are weak and can be deceived, and openly launched a rebellion, trying to maintain their backward, reactionary, dark, and cruel serf system forever, and also think that the Tibetan people are willing to be their slaves and beasts forever. But they are completely wrong. Betraying the motherland and betraying the people, they will lose everything.

We are very regretful that in this rebellion of the reactionary group in the upper echelons of the former Tibetan local government, some Indian expansionists played an ignominious role. They have done their best to discredit, slander, and sow discord among the Chinese people and the Chinese government, seriously violating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and tarnishing the traditional friendship between China and India. What is particularly surprising is that the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" was distributed by Indian diplomatic officials in Tezpur on April 18. This statement is full of loopholes in content and tone. It is obviously not the Dalai Lama's own will but was imposed on him by others. Since the Dalai Lama is now under rebellious coercion, even if he issues ten statements, they do not represent his own will. (Warm applause) Our country is a country where the people are the masters, and all policies are based on the will of the people and start from the interests of the people. The Tibetan people support the unity of the motherland and will never allow any foreigners to interfere in China's internal affairs. A so-called statement of the Dalai Lama of unknown origin will not have the slightest impact on China's unity and the progress and development of Tibet. The Chinese and Indian people cherish Sino-Indian friendship very much. Prime Minister Nehru, as a far-sighted politician of India and one of the founders of the "Five Principles," wants to be able to make wise decisions on this issue, which is of great importance to Sino-Indian friendship, based on the international norms of friendly coexistence between two independent and self-respecting countries.

The liberated 1.2 million Tibetan people will understand who gives them happiness, who gives them slavery, who are their relatives, and who are their enemies. For their own new life, the Tibetan people will surely be able to quickly and thoroughly crush the conspiracies and tricks of a small group of rebellious elements and imperialists, remove the stumbling blocks on the road to advancement, and, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, smoothly and gradually realize democratic reforms, and build the Tibetan Plateau into a true paradise on earth, advancing side by side with the brotherly ethnic groups of the whole country, and embarking on the bright road of socialism together. (Applause)

Fellow representatives, fellow committee members, 1959 is a decisive year in our three-year hard struggle. With the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, we will surely be able to successfully complete and overfulfill the planned tasks for 1959. The imperialists and reactionaries' gloating, slander, incitement, sowing discord, and other despicable tricks are all in vain. Let us unite closely around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and advance victoriously! (Prolonged and thunderous applause)

专栏：

    印度扩张主义者在西藏叛乱中扮演了很不光采的角色
    水利电力部傅作义部长的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告和李维汉副主席所作政协常务委员会工作报告。现在我仅就水利电力工作和我个人的一些体会，作一个简单的发言。
    水利电力事业空前发展，水利工程对农业大丰收起了一定作用
    在去年全民的全面大跃进中，水利电力事业，也和其他事业一样，获得了空前的发展和跃进。在水利建设方面，亿万群众在中国共产党的英明领导下，发挥了无穷的智慧和冲天的干劲。他们的壮志豪语是：“万水千山听调动，玉皇龙王听指挥”，“付出几年辛苦，换得万年幸福”。一九五八年，全国共完成土石方五百八十亿公方，扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，初步治理洼涝面积二亿一千万亩，初步控制水土流失面积三十二万平方公里。淮河、黄河、海河、长江、珠江、辽河、松花江等大江大河的治理和开发准备工作又有了新的进展。我国水利建设事业这样的发展速度、建设规模，都创造了世界水利建设史上的奇迹。（鼓掌）
    大家知道，一九五八年上半年，我国许多地区，如河北、山东、辽宁、安徽、湖北、广西等地，都发生了轻重不同的干旱。入秋以来，黄河、汉江等河流又有相当大的洪水，河北东部、山东南部、河南西部等地区都发生了比较集中的暴雨。由于广大人民群众在抗旱防汛中的英勇斗争，加上历年来特别是去年所修工程的作用，大大减轻了旱涝灾害，战胜了黄河和汉江的特大洪水。去年农业的大丰收，水利工程是起了一定作用的。
    在电力工业方面，一九五八年总发电量达二百七十五亿度，比一九五七年增长了百分之四十二；新增装机容量共一百七十九万瓩，比一九五七年增长了一点四倍，相当第一个五年计划期间新增装机容量总和的三分之二以上。此外，农村建设的电站约有十三万瓩。这是解放以来我国电力工业发展速度最快的一年。去年我国电力工业的增长，虽然还不能完全适应工农业生产大跃进的新形势，但是基本上保证了以钢为纲的工业生产的用电需要，并且为今年电力工业的继续跃进打下了基础。
    水利电力建设事业能够取得这样巨大的成就，是党的建设社会主义总路线的利胜，是全民整风运动的胜利，是广大群众和水利电力职工艰苦奋战的胜利，也是和苏联与其他社会主义国家对我们的无私援助分不开的。（热烈鼓掌）
    一九五九年，全国施工的限额以上的水利基本建设项目共二十八项，农田水利扩大灌溉面积一亿亩。新建和扩建限额以上的水、火电站基本建设项目共一百八十四项，比第一个五年计划期间电力工业的全部限额以上工程项目还多；今年计划年发电量四百亿度，比一九五八年增长百分之四十五，这是一个继续大跃进的计划。（鼓掌）
    完成这个计划，我们需要作很大的努力。在这里我想谈谈以下几个问题：
  一、几年以来，在水利方面，我们虽然做了很多工作，对减轻我国历史性的水旱灾害起了很大作用，但是还必须指出，水旱灾害并没有完全解决，到目前为止，仍然有很多地区受着水旱灾害的威胁。因此，我们必须本着“从最坏处打算，向最好处努力”的精神，力争今年不发生严重的水灾和旱灾。
    现在的情况是：经过治理的河流，防洪防涝的能力已经大为提高，在一般洪水的情况下，可以保证安全。但是，在治本工程没有全部完成以前，各大江河主要还是依靠堤防来挡水，防洪效能仍然有一定的限度，对于可能发生的较大洪水或特大洪水，还不能完全控制。
    在西北、华北和东北的部分地区，由于雨量较少、水源不足，各年的水量极不稳定，过去曾不断发生不同程度的旱灾；南方地区，水利资源虽然比较丰富，但是目前不少地区水利工程的抗旱标准仍然很低，如果遇到几十天不下雨，就会发生缺水的现象，多雨季节，山区又经常受到山洪灾害的威胁。
    因此，在继续进行江河治理和广泛开展群众性水利建设的同时，大力加强防汛、防旱和除涝工作，在今后较长时期内，还是一个艰巨的任务。
    二、我国的电力工业，发展速度已经是相当快的了，但是，在整个国民经济的发展中，仍然是个比较薄弱的环节。在今年计划的安排中，国家已经根据可能条件，努力提高了电力的生产指标，并且规定了大力制造发电设备的任务。我们相信，随着我国电机制造能力的不断提高，电力工业不能完全适应国民经济迅速发展的情况，今后将会逐步改变。为了完成今年的任务，我们要在保证质量的前提下，尽量争取新的电站早发电；对现有设备，在保证安全运行的前提下，尽量争取多发电、多供电；在已经缺电和即将缺电的地方，一方面要大力开展节约用电运动，同时还要开展“小、土、群”的办电运动。
    三、关于水电建设的问题，去年吉林丰满和四川狮子滩两个水电站都碰上了特殊枯水年，第四季以后发电量特别减少，因而有些人对发展水电，产生了不同的理解。我们认为，水电站在丰水年分多发电，在枯水年分少发电，这是水电站的特点，但是，象丰满和狮子滩水电站去年这种特殊枯水，是多年一遇的现象，这个问题，在电站的设计上是预计到的，在运行管理上也是可以作妥善安排的。我国的水力资源十分丰富，而且开发条件也非常优越，特别是各大江河都有严重的洪水灾害，必须修建许多大型的控制性的水利枢纽工程。为了充分利用水利资源，这些工程都应该是防洪、发电、灌溉综合利用的工程。因此，我们除了大搞火电以外，水电也要大力发展。
    一九五八年大跃进的事实，给了帝国主义和反动派一个响亮耳光
    近两年来，因为我在病中，很少参加具体工作。关于水利电力工作情况就说到这里。下面说说我个人的一些感想和体会。
    在第一届全国人民代表大会四年任期内，我们祖国建设和世界形势都发生了重大的变化。正如周总理在政府工作报告中所说，我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，已经在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面获得了辉煌的成就。在两条道路的斗争中，社会主义已经基本上战胜了资本主义。由于第一个五年计划的胜利完成，我国已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。在这个基础上，一九五八年出现了我国史无前例的国民经济大跃进。一九五九年国民经济计划仍然是一个继续大跃进的计划。与此同时，苏联正在进行着全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟的七年计划。完全可以肯定，在一个不很长的历史时期内，苏联将在按人口平均计算的生产水平方面超过美国，我国也将变成一个先进的大工业国。整个社会主义阵营，将在物质生产方面，显著地超过帝国主义阵营，从而使得世界和平得到充分的保障。大家看，我们已经取得的成就和即将实现的理想，是一幅多么令人兴奋的雄伟壮丽的画图啊！（热烈鼓掌）
    帝国主义和反动派一向怀着幸灾乐祸的主观愿望来看我们。可是事情的发展总是和他们的愿望相反。当我们经过一九五六年的生产高潮，在一九五七年进行整顿巩固的时候，帝国主义和反动派就愚蠢地发出他们的笑声，说我们的经济遇到了大困难了，活不下去了。对于帝国主义和反动派这种幸灾乐祸的回答，是一九五八年我们钢铁粮棉产量都翻一番的大跃进，给了他们一个响亮的耳光。（热烈鼓掌）
    在一九五七年那个“不平常的春天”里，资产阶级右派分子向党向人民发动了猖狂的进攻，帝国主义和反动派以为中国天下大乱，赶忙给这些人喝采，可是结果如何呢？在共产党的领导下，全国人民彻底击败了右派的进攻。大是大非更加明白，人民的觉悟更加提高，党的领导更加巩固，以无产阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线更加巩固和扩大了。第二届政协全国委员会委员人数是七百二十九人，这一届增加到一千零七十一人。一部分表示愿意悔改的右派分子又被提名为委员。现在第二届第一次全国人民代表大会与第三届第一次政协全国委员会同时召开。来自全国各地的各民族、各社会阶层的代表人物，两千多人，济济一堂，总结我国社会主义建设的巨大成就，动员全国人民实现今年的继续大跃进。这真是一次人民大团结的大会，大跃进的大会。帝国主义和反动派所指望的中国天下大乱，就这样落空了。广大知识分子和党的关系，不是疏远而是更亲近了。他们中的许多先进分子，成为光荣的共产党员，走进了无产阶级先进队伍的行列。（鼓掌）
    帝国主义和反动派常常看到我们有点困难就幸灾乐祸。他们不懂得，我们的困难和资本主义国家的困难根本不同。资本主义国家的困难是没落中的困难，愈陷愈深。我们的困难是发展中的困难，是前进中的困难。任何困难我们都能克服，而且克服困难之后，接着就是个大胜利。上面的事实难道还不足以说明这个道理吗？（热烈鼓掌）
    “一九五八年，一种新的社会组织象初升的太阳一样，在亚洲东部的广阔的地平线上出现了，这就是我国农村中的大规模的、工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社。它一出现，就以它的强大的生命力，引起了人们广泛的注意”。但是，帝国主义和反动派对于中国人民这个伟大的创造，也不放松他们的造谣中伤。事实上我们农村人民公社建立还不到一年的时间，已经在各方面表现出它巨大的优越性。就是从水利方面来看，它的优越性也很明显。水利事业要求集体经营，只有全面规划，才能充分利用水土资源。合作化特别是公社化以后，土地连成大片，劳力可以合理调配，上下游、左右岸蓄水排水的利害矛盾，可以在更大的范围内统筹兼顾。使水库、渠道、池塘、水井互相结合，连接成一套完整的蓄水、输水、用水系统。荒山、丘陵、平原和盐碱洼地，都得到了改造，使地尽其利，在生产上发挥最大的效用。在公社的劳力使用上，可以分，可以合，既能发挥专业队的特长，又能进行季节性的突击。公社不仅可以发展农林牧副渔多种经济，而且可以举办自己需要的各项加工工业。资本主义国家的老爷们都懂得，大工厂比小工厂效率高，利润大；大农庄比小农庄效率高，收益多。我们的人民公社的特点就是一大二公。在集体经营下，同样的土地，同样的劳力，产量可以成倍地增长。不过，我们和资本主义国家有个根本不同之点，就是，在资本主义国家收益的绝大部分被资本家和庄园主剥夺去了，而我们则一切为人民所有。公社的生产越发展，收益越增多，公社社员按劳分配的部分也将逐年相应增加。我最近访问了几个人民公社，他们一九五九年的计划生产总值，有的比去年增加三分之二，有的增加一倍。一九五八年已经做到了百分之九十以上的社员都增加收入，其余也不低于一九五七年的水平，并且做到了吃饭不要钱，男女老幼不论有没有劳动力，都得到了最可靠的社会保险。今年随着生产的发展，每个社员和他的家庭总收入，一定会大大地增加。在公社总收入中只拿出百分之几举办集体福利事业，就可以做到“老有所终，幼有所长，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”。我们人民公社到底好不好呢？我说好的很！全国六亿多人民都说好的很！不管帝国主义和反动派胡说什么，我们的人民公社必然日益繁荣昌盛。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    在西藏叛乱事件中，尼赫鲁总理应该根据友好相处准则作出明智措置
    最近，原西藏地方政府上层反动分子在帝国主义、蒋匪帮和外国反动派的蛊惑煽动下，公然撕毁和平解放西藏的十七条协议，发动武装叛乱，妄图分裂祖国的统一，破坏民族团结。大家知道，西藏是中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分，藏族人民是祖国大家庭中的一员，这是千百年来历史上肯定的事实，连帝国主义者也不能不承认。原西藏地方政府上层反动分子这种背叛祖国、破坏统一、破坏民族团结的严重罪行，是全国各族人民包括西藏爱国人民所不能容许的。人民解放军驻西藏部队，在西藏广大僧俗群众热烈支持下，已经迅速平息了拉萨地区和其他主要地区的叛乱。这件事，再一次证明帝国主义和反动派对我们的胜利总是不甘心的，总是企图在我们内部制造一些问题。但是这些阴谋注定是要失败的。因为社会必须向前发展，人民要求生活改善，先进的必然要代替落后的，这是大势所趋，任何人都阻挡不了的。那些和旧制度相联系的上层分子，如果能顺应这个趋势，人人都有光明前途，如果违反这个趋势，必然为人民所抛弃。和平解放西藏十七条协议，有利于祖国的团结统一，有利于西藏人民，并且对于西藏地方上层分子作了适当的照顾。在祖国社会主义建设飞跃发展的情况下，西藏人民和进步的上中层分子迫切要求民主改革，发展生产，改善生活。中央人民政府为了给西藏上层人士以充分考虑的时间，一再说服人民耐心等待。可是，那些反动的上层分子身在福中不知福，不懂得这一番宽容等待的善意，反以为我们是软弱可欺，公然发动叛乱，妄图永远保持他们落后的、反动的、黑暗的、残酷的农奴制度，还以为西藏人民也愿意永远作他们的奴隶牛马。可是，他们完全错了。背叛祖国，背叛人民，他们就将丢掉一切。
    我们非常遗憾，在这次原西藏地方政府上层反动集团的叛乱事件中，印度的一些扩张主义分子扮演了很不光彩的角色。对中国人民和中国政府极尽诋毁诬蔑和挑拨离间的能事，严重的违反了和平共处的五项原则，沾污了中印之间的传统友谊。特别使人惊讶的，是四月十八日在提斯浦尔由印度外交官员散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这个声明在内容上、口吻上漏洞百出，显然不是达赖喇嘛本人的意愿而是别人强加于他的。达赖喇嘛现在既然处在叛乱劫持之下，发表十个声明，也都不代表他本人的意志。（热烈鼓掌）我们的国家是人民当家作主的国家，一切政策都是根据人民的意志，从人民的利益出发。西藏人民拥护祖国统一，决不允许任何外国人干涉中国的内政，一纸来历不明的所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，对中国的统一和西藏的进步和发展，不会发生丝毫的影响。中国人民和印度人民都十分珍视中印友谊，尼赫鲁总理作为印度一个有远见的政治家，作为“五项原则”创始人之一，在这个对中印友谊有重大关系的问题上，想能根据两个独立自尊的国家友好相处的国际准则，作出明智的措置。
    解放了的一百二十万西藏人民，他们会懂得谁给他们幸福，谁给他们奴役，谁是亲人，谁是敌人。西藏人民为了自己的新生，一定能够迅速地彻底粉碎一小撮叛乱分子和帝国主义的阴谋诡计，搬掉前进路上的绊脚石，在中央人民政府和西藏自治区筹备委员会的领导下，顺利地逐步实现民主改革，把西藏高原建设成一个真正的人间乐园，与全国各兄弟民族并肩前进，一同走上社会主义的光明大道。（鼓掌）
    各位代表，各位委员，一九五九年是我们苦战三年中具有决定性的一年。我们有党中央和毛主席的正确领导，有一九五八年大跃进的丰富经验，有广大群众的冲天革命干劲，一定能够胜利完成和超额完成一九五九年的计划任务。帝国主义和反动派的幸灾乐祸，造谣中伤，蛊惑煽动，挑拨离间等等卑鄙的伎俩，都是枉费心机。让我们紧密地团结在共产党和毛主席周围，胜利前进！（经久不息的掌声）
