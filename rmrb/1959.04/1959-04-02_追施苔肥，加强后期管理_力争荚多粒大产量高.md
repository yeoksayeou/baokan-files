Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: More than 40 million mu of rapeseed across the country are generally bolting, and in areas with earlier seasons, flowering and pod formation have already begun.

The rapeseed is growing very well this year. According to surveys in major rapeseed-producing areas such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, the area of first- and second-class rapeseed, which are growing well, accounts for an average of over 80%. In some areas, the third-class seedlings are equivalent to last year's second-class seedlings, and the second-class seedlings are equivalent to last year's first-class seedlings. The 14 million mu of "Victory Rapeseed" across the country are growing even taller with larger leaves. This rapeseed is currently the best improved variety in China, and its yield is half to double that of ordinary rapeseed.

Many counties and people's communes in various rapeseed-producing areas are currently launching large-scale, high-yield movements centered on strengthening the later management of rapeseed, striving for per-mu yields of 300 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin of rapeseed. In Zhejiang Province, topdressing has been applied to half of the more than 4 million mu of rapeseed fields, with second-class seedlings generally being upgraded, and the proportion of third-class seedlings decreasing from the original 30% to 14%. In the suburban areas of Shanghai, the sixty-plus mu of rapeseed fields in eleven counties have also generally been topdressed once or twice. Songjiang County recently conducted a major field inspection and is taking various measures to strengthen management, ensuring that rapeseed successfully passes the three "stages" of bolting, flowering, and harvesting, and overcomes possible rain, waterlogging, pests, and other disasters. In Hunan Province, a high tide of topdressing and ditch clearing for drainage is being launched in various rapeseed-producing areas. Many areas have launched red banner competitions under the slogan of "guaranteeing harvests on every plot and high yields on every mu." Xinghua County, a famous high-yield rapeseed county in Jiangsu Province, has also been working hard in recent days to topdress, water, kill insects, and remove weeds for rapeseed, determined to win the high-yield rapeseed red banner again this year.

In order to strive for large-scale rapeseed production, many areas have successively convened on-site field management meetings, promoting advanced experience in rapeseed cultivation, and striving for large-scale rapeseed production this year.

    追施苔肥，加强后期管理
    力争荚多粒大产量高
    据新华社1日讯　全国各地四千多万亩油菜普遍抽苔，季节较早的地区并已开始开花结荚。
    今年油菜长得很出色。据四川、云南、贵州、湖北、湖南、广东、安徽、江苏、浙江和上海等主要油菜产区的调查，长得好的一、二类油菜的面积，平均占到80％以上，有些地区的三类苗相当于去年的二类苗，二类苗相当于去年的一类苗。全国一千四百多万亩的“胜利油菜”，更是长得株高叶大。这种油菜是我国目前最好的良种油菜，它的产量要比一般油菜高半倍到一倍以上。
    各油菜产区的许多县和人民公社，目前都在展开以加强油菜后期管理为中心、力争亩产菜籽三百斤、五百斤、八百斤等的油菜大面积高额丰产运动。浙江全省四百多万亩油菜田半数已经追施苔肥，二类苗普遍升级，三类苗已由原来的占30％下降到占14％。上海市郊区十一个县六十多万亩油菜田也普遍追了一次到两次苔肥，松江县最近经过田间大检查，正采取各种措施加强管理，保证油菜过好抽苔、开花、收获三个“关”和战胜可能的雨涝病虫等灾害。湖南省各油菜产区正在掀起追肥、清沟沥水等油菜培育管理高潮，许多地区在“丘丘保收，亩亩丰产”的口号下展开了红旗竞赛。著名油菜高产县江苏兴化县连日来也在紧张地为油菜追肥、浇水、灭虫，除草，决心今年再夺油菜高产红旗。
    为了争取油菜大面积丰产，不少地区相继召开了油菜田间管理现场会议，推广培育油菜的先进经验，争取今年油菜大面积丰产。
