This dispatch from Xi'an reports: Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province's first pest-free cotton county (Note: Zhouzhi is pronounced "zhou zhi". Yuanhe Zhi notes: "A bend in the mountain is called Zhou, a bend in the river is called Zhi." Zhouzhi County is located in western Shaanxi, bordering the Qinling Mountains to the south and the Wei River to the north, named for its surrounding mountains and rivers), is continuing to exert its utmost efforts to strive for the complete elimination of pests and diseases in all crops this year. They guarantee to completely eliminate four types of pests and diseases, including the wheat blossom midge, red spider mites, cotton bollworms, and sweet potato black rot; to basically eliminate twenty-six types of pests and diseases, including stripe rust, wheat spider mites, cotton aphids, blind plant bugs, corn borers, and rice stem borers; and to basically control all other types of pests and diseases.

Currently, the people of Zhouzhi County are engaged in a day-and-night battle against wheat stripe rust. Across more than 200,000 mu of wheat fields found to be infected with stripe rust, all people's communes have applied a 3% ammonium sulfate solution once or twice, basically controlling the development of stripe rust. The Huaiya People's Commune discovered stripe rust in more than 20,000 mu of wheat on March 22nd, and on the same day, mobilized 32,000 people to apply the solution once, eliminating 60,000 centers of infection. After 24 hours of inspection, the prevention and control effect reached 100%. Since the Spring Festival, the county has fought four battles in the prevention and control of stripe rust, with each involving 120,000 people. While preventing and controlling stripe rust, various localities have also eradicated weeds, leveled low-lying areas, and scalded cotton-drying mats with boiling water, achieving "three clearances" (clear weeds, clear debris, clear discards) and "eight cleanlinesses" (clean fields, clean roads, clean embankments, clean villages, clean well sides, clean gravesides, clean paddy field sides, and clean alfalfa fields). To ensure that all crops are completely free from pests and diseases, the county has established a network of pest and disease forecasting stations that are as numerous as stars in the sky, based on last year's pest prevention efforts: the county has established a forecasting station, and the people's communes have established eighteen forecasting points; the number of forecasters has increased from the original 215 to 410, and the number of investigators has increased from the original 778 to 1,400, with an average of one investigator for every hundred mu of land. Furthermore, the pest and disease prevention and control teams have been further reorganized. In the specialized teams, the method of inserting signs to delineate areas is adopted to strengthen individual responsibility, ensuring that every plot is managed and every moment is guarded. Joint prevention has also been organized between communes, between management areas, and between teams, layer by layer, blockading and completely encircling and suppressing pests and diseases.

Zhouzhi County, bordering the Qinling Mountains to the south and the Wei River to the north, has abundant water, numerous pests, and many weeds, known as the "three plagues," and is one of the counties with the most pests in Shaanxi Province. Before liberation, it suffered from disasters every year, with complete crop failures in severe cases. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and government, the local masses launched a struggle against pests and diseases, gradually reducing them. By 1955, the wheat blossom midge disease was basically controlled. Later, cotton pests and diseases were also basically controlled. In 1958, further progress was made to achieve pest-free cotton throughout the county, with ginned cotton yield increasing sharply from an average of forty-two jin per mu in 1957 to one hundred and forty-three jin (referring only to Zhouzhi County before the county merger). Since the beginning of this year, the people of the county have been in high spirits and full of fighting spirit, unanimously putting forward the battle cry of achieving complete freedom from pests and diseases for all crops.

The main experiences of Zhouzhi County in pest control are as follows: First, the secretary takes the lead, carrying through to the end. The county party committee established a long-term pest control headquarters early on, with Zhang Jingwen, the first secretary of the county party committee, serving as the commander-in-chief, and Ma Shengxi, the deputy secretary, serving as the pest control commander. Leading cadres at all levels all cultivate pest control experimental plots, ensuring regular forecasting, regular inspection, and immediate elimination of pests and diseases as soon as they are discovered. Second, vigorously carry out a mass movement for pest control. The county's leading cadres adopted the method of cultivating experimental plots in the prosperous agricultural cooperative to gain experience, and then educated the masses through comparative experiments and on-site visits. When the masses saw that the cotton seedlings in the cotton fields that had been treated were green and the cotton bolls were large, while the cotton seedlings in the cotton fields that had not been treated were red and the cotton bolls were small, they were encouraged and learned pest control methods. As a result of this consistent approach, pest control work has penetrated the hearts of the people throughout the county, and every household knows about it. Regardless of gender or age, people not only understand the general patterns of pest outbreaks, but also know how to prevent them; not only know how to prevent one type, but also know how to prevent several types. Third, invite advisors and learn from teachers, so that everyone learns pest control skills. Establish the idea of benefiting the people and eliminating harm in all cadres, and learn technology diligently by taking technicians as teachers. The county also established a plant protection and plant quarantine station with the participation of technicians as an advisory body to the county party committee. In addition, a pest and disease forecasting network has been established, so that cadres and the masses can be well-informed and seize favorable opportunities for pest control. Winter pest control not only saves labor, time, medicine, and machinery, but also seizes the weak links of pests, making it easier to eliminate them.

The county will also use airplanes for pest control in the first and middle ten days of April, which is still an experiment in Shaanxi Province. Currently, the county's pest control headquarters has moved to the field to work on-site, in order to create experience and promote it comprehensively.

### 盩厔县全面围剿小麦条锈病

    盩厔县全面围剿小麦条锈病
    本报西安3日电　陕西省第一个棉花无病虫害县——盩厔县（按：盩厔读舟至zhou　zhi，元和志注：“山曲曰盩，水曲曰厔”，盩厔县在陕西西部，南依秦岭，北濒渭河，因山环水绕而得名），正在继续鼓足干劲，争取今年全面消灭各种农作物的病虫害。他们保证要彻底消灭吸浆虫、红蜘蛛、红铃虫、红薯黑斑病等四种病虫害；基本消灭条锈病、麦蜘蛛、棉蚜、盲椿象、玉米螟、水稻二化螟等二十六种病虫害；并基本控制其他各种病虫害。
    现在，盩厔县的人民正在夜以继日地同小麦条锈病进行激战。各人民公社在二十多万亩发现有条锈病的麦田上，全部用3％的硫酸铵药治了一遍到两遍，基本上控制了条锈病的发展。槐芽人民公社在3月22日发现两万多亩小麦有条锈病，当天即出动了三万二千人，全部药治一遍，消灭发病中心六万个，经过二十四小时以后检查，防治效果达到100％。春节以来，这个县在防治条锈病方面已经打了四个战役，每次参加人数达十二万。各地结合防治条锈病，还先后铲除了杂草，平整了凹墚地区，用开水烫了晒棉花的席箔，实现了三光（铲光、拾光、处理光）八净（地净、路净、埝净、村净、井边净、坟边净、稻田边净、苜蓿地净）。为了确保各种农作物全面无病虫害，这个县在去年防虫的基础上，建立了一个星罗棋布的虫情测报网：县上设立了测报站，人民公社设立了十八个测报点；测报员已由原来二百一十五人发展到四百一十人，普查员由原来七百七十八人发展到一千四百人，平均每百亩地有一个普查员。并且进一步整顿了防治病虫害队伍。在专业队里，采取插标划界的办法，加强个人责任制，做到块块有人管，时时有人防。公社与公社之间、管理区与管理区之间、队与队之间，还组织了联防，层层封锁、全面围剿病虫害。
    盩厔县南依秦岭，北濒渭河，全县水多、虫多、草多，人们称为三害，是陕西省虫害最多的一个县。解放前，年年危害成灾，严重时一无收成。解放后，当地群众在党政领导下，和病虫害展开斗争，病虫害逐渐减轻，到1955年止，基本上控制了小麦吸浆虫病。以后又基本上控制了棉花病虫害；1958年更进而做到全县棉花无病虫害，皮棉由1957年平均每亩四十二斤，猛增到一百四十三斤（仅指县制合并以前的盩厔县）。今年以来，全县人民意气风发、斗志昂扬，一致提出要实现各种农作物全面无病虫害的战斗口号。
    盩厔县防虫工作的经验主要有下列几点：一、书记挂帅，一贯到底。县委很早就成立了长期性的防虫指挥部，由县委第一书记张景文担任总指挥，副书记麻生西担任防虫司令，各级领导干部都搞防虫试验田，作到经常测报，经常检查，一有病虫，就立即消灭。二、大搞防虫群众运动。这个县领导干部采取在富饶农业社种试验田的办法，取得经验，然后通过对比试验、现场参观、大大教育了群众。当群众看到富饶农业社防治过的棉田棉苗绿、棉桃大，没防治的棉田棉苗红、棉桃小，鼓舞了群众的信心并学到了防虫的方法。这样一贯坚持的结果，防虫工作深入全县人心，家喻户晓，无论男女老少，不但懂得一般害虫的发病规律，而且会防；不但会防一种，而且会防好几种。三、请参谋、拜老师，人人学会防虫本领。在全县干部中树立为人民兴利除害的思想，并拜技术人员为老师，努力学习技术。县上还设立一个有技术人员参加的植保植检站，作为县委的参谋机构。此外，还建立了虫情测报网，使干部、群众耳目灵通，可以抓住防虫的有利时机。在冬季防虫，不但省工、省时、省药械，同时可以抓住虫害的薄弱环节，容易消灭。
    这个县还将在4月上、中旬，用飞机进行防虫，这在陕西省还是一个尝试。现在，该县防虫指挥部已经搬到现场办公，以便创造经验，全面推广。
