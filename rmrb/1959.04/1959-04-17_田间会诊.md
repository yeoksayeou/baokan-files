　　"Field Consultation"
    (Our report) Chengdu, April 16th. The Taiping People's Commune in Xinjin County, Sichuan Province, has adopted the method of field consultation in its soil survey work, which has powerfully promoted current agricultural production. For example, a patch of third-class seedlings of spring crops in Jiancao Dam of this commune had been top-dressed four times, but did not improve. Based on this situation, the survey team, together with commune cadres and experienced farmers, conducted a consultation and found that the main problem with this land was poor soil drainage, resulting in low soil temperature, little air, difficult respiration for wheat roots, and inactive soil microorganisms, making it difficult to decompose nutrients. It was also discovered that the soil was a strong carbonate reaction, with low available phosphorus content, and the top-dressing fertilizer lacked phosphorus, so the wheat did not tiller and the roots did not develop.
    Based on the consultation results, the following prescriptions were proposed: 1. Apply dry, powdered quick-acting fertilizer, such as old wall mud with a small amount of phosphate fertilizer; 2. Concentrate fertilization near the roots to increase soil temperature and allow nutrients to dissolve and seep into the soil; 3. Apply nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer outside the roots to strengthen root absorption capacity.
    For the thorough transformation of this soil, everyone also proposed some fundamental methods. According to the fact that Jiancao Dam is surrounded by a bag-shaped drainage ditch, and irrigation water can be supplied by a water trough across the ditch, the circuitous drainage ditch should be dug through near the approach point to allow water to drain directly away to lower the groundwater level. This also avoids the danger of summer floods and ensures the safety of the water trough.
    Through this consultation, both the current "prescription" was found and a longer-term plan was proposed. The masses said that the soil survey team is a "soil medical team" and also a "production inspection team." The Wenjiang Special District attached great importance to the commune's experience and promptly held an on-site meeting to exchange and promote this working method. (He Xingpan)

### “田间会诊”

　　“田间会诊”
    本报讯　四川省新津县太平人民公社在土壤普查工作中采取田间会诊的办法，有力地推动了当前的农业生产。例如这个公社的涧漕坝的一片小春三类苗，施追肥四次，但是不升级。普查工作组根据这一情况同公社干部和老农一起进行会诊，发现这块土地主要是土壤排水不良，以致土温低、空气少、麦根呼吸作用困难，土壤微生物也因此不活动，养分不易分解；另外发现这块地的土壤是强碳酸盐反应，可利用的磷酸含量少，而追的肥又缺乏磷质，因而小麦不分蘖，根不发展。
    根据会诊结果，提出以下药方：一、追施干的粉状速效肥，如老墙泥加少量磷肥；二、集中在根部附近施肥，以提高土温，使养分溶解后，渗入土中；三、根外追施氮磷肥，以加强根部吸收能力。
    对于彻底改造这块土壤，大家也提出了一些根本办法。根据涧漕坝为一袋形排水沟所围绕，灌溉水可由沟对岸渡水槽供给，所以将迂回的排水沟在接近处挖通，使水直接排走以降低地下水位，这样还避免了夏季洪水为患，保障渡水槽的安全。
    经过这次会诊，既找到了当前的“药方”，也提出了比较长远的规划。群众说土壤普查队是“土壤医疗队”、也是“生产检查队”。温江专区很重视这个公社的经验，及时召开现场会交流和推广了这种工作方法。　（何兴磻）
