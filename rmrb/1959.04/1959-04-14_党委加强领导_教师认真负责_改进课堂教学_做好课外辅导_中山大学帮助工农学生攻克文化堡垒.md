　　Party Committee Strengthens Leadership, Teachers are Conscientious and Responsible, Improving Classroom Teaching, Doing a Good Job of Extracurricular Tutoring:
　　Zhongshan University Helps Worker-Peasant Students Conquer Cultural Fortresses
　　(Our Newspaper News) The Party organization of Zhongshan University has adopted various measures to strengthen the work of cultivating worker-peasant students. The academic performance of most of the students participating in worker-peasant preparatory studies has been significantly improved.
　　Among the 288 students in the worker-peasant preparatory course held by Zhongshan University last September, many were outstanding worker-peasant cadres, young workers, and young farmers who had participated in industrial and agricultural production labor for more than three years. 90% of them are party members and members of the Communist Youth League. Generally, they had only completed junior high school or spare-time junior high school in the past. At the beginning of their enrollment, due to their poor cultural foundation, they encountered many difficulties in their studies. Many people felt insufficient confidence in learning the cultural and scientific knowledge of the high school stage within one to two years. In response to these situations, the general party branch of the worker-peasant preparatory course immediately strengthened the political and ideological education of teachers and students through study mobilization and organized discussions, and invited disabled soldiers to make learning reports to help them conquer the cultural and scientific fortress with a tenacious spirit; in addition, it also helped teachers establish the view of serving workers and peasants, taking care of the characteristics of worker-peasant students in teaching work, and doing a good job of extracurricular tutoring. Yang Caiping, the secretary of the general party branch, and the members of the general party branch also often went deep into the classes and listened to the lectures with the students to understand the specific difficulties and opinions of the students in their studies and help the teachers improve their teaching. When relatively major problems in teaching work were discovered, the general party branch also held "three-way combination" meetings including members of the general party branch, teachers, and students to jointly study and solve them. For example, in the arrangement of teaching time, originally two to three courses were taught every day. Later, the students reflected that there was too much content and it was difficult to accept. The general party branch held two "three-way combination" meetings successively to study and try to adopt a method of basically only teaching one course every day so that students could concentrate time and energy to learn one course every day; it also facilitated teachers to strengthen tutoring work. As a result, students and teachers were generally satisfied.
　　Under the leadership and promotion of the party organization, the teachers also actively tried to help students overcome learning difficulties and improve teaching quality. Various teaching and research groups often held student representative forums of varying degrees to solicit students' opinions on teaching work and try to improve teaching. In view of the characteristics of worker-peasant students with rich production experience and strong comprehension ability, teachers of various subjects also adopted a preview method, guiding students to focus on reading the text and raising difficult questions before each class, and then the teachers made systematic explanations in class, focusing on explaining the problems that students found difficult to understand. This not only cultivates students' ability to think independently, but also enables them to master knowledge more firmly. For some students with poor grades, many teachers also take time out of class to give them special tutoring or make-up lessons. Science teachers also often lead students to nearby factories for on-site teaching, and liberal arts teachers have led students to carry out essay writing activities, mobilizing students to write out their past experiences in work and production to further improve their writing skills.
　　Under the care of the party organization and the patient teaching of the teachers, the students all studied hard with a tenacious spirit. They organized many mutual aid groups to teach and learn from each other. The students in Science Class B visit the teachers in groups every week to ask for advice on learning methods and raise opinions on teaching work. At the beginning of the last semester, many students failed every assignment or test, but in an exam before the start of this semester, the scores of most students in each subject were above three or four points. According to the estimate of the leaders of the subject, about one-third of the students can complete the original two-year study task within one year and reach the level of graduation from a worker-peasant quick-track middle school.

　　党委加强领导　教师认真负责　改进课堂教学　做好课外辅导
　　中山大学帮助工农学生攻克文化堡垒
    本报讯　中山大学党组织采取各种措施，加强培养工农学生的工作，参加工农预科学习的大多数学生，学习成绩得到显著提高。
    在中山大学去年9月举办的工农预科学习的二百八十八名学生中，许多都是参加过工、农业生产劳动三年以上的优秀工农干部、青年工人和青年农民，其中90％都是党员和团员。他们一般过去只念过初中或业余初中。入学初期，由于文化基础较差，学习上碰到很多困难，不少人对在一至两年内学好高中阶段的文化科学知识感到信心不足。针对这些情况，工农预科的党总支即通过学习动员和组织讨论，邀请残废军人作学习报告等活动，加强对教师、学生的政治思想教育，帮助他们用顽强的精神攻克文化科学堡垒；此外，还帮助教师树立为工农服务的观点，在教学工作中照顾工农学生特点，做好课外辅导等。党总支书记杨采萍和党总支委员们还经常深入各班和学生一起听课，了解学生学习上的具体困难和意见，帮助教师改进教学。在发现了教学工作中比较重大问题时，党总支还召开包括有党总支委员、教师、学生参加的“三结合”会议，共同研究解决。如在教学时间的安排上，原来每天都上二至三门课，后来学生反映学习内容太多，接受困难，党总支就先后召开了两次“三结合”会议进行研究，并试行采取每天基本上只上一门课的办法，以使学生每天能够集中时间、精力学好一门功课；也便于教师加强辅导工作，结果学生、教师都普遍感到满意。
    在党组织的领导和推动下，教师们也积极设法帮助学生克服学习困难，提高教学质量。各个教研组经常召开不同程度的学生代表座谈会，征求学生对教学工作的意见，设法改进教学。针对工农学生生产经验丰富、理解能力较强的特点，各科教师还采取预习办法，每天上课前指导学生预先重点阅读课文和提出疑难问题，上课时教师再作系统讲解，并针对学生难懂的问题重点解释，这样，既可以培养学生独立思考能力，又使他们较牢固地掌握知识。对于一些程度较差的学生，不少教师还抽出课余时间为他们作特别辅导或补课。理科的教师还经常带领学生到附近的工厂进行现场教学，文科的教师曾领导学生开展了写论文的活动，发动学生将他们过去在工作、生产中的体会写出来，进一步提高他们的写作水平。
    学生们在党组织的关怀和教师们的耐心教导下，都以顽强的精神刻苦学习。他们分别组织了许多互助小组，互教互学。理科乙班的学生每周都分组去拜访教师，请教学习方法和提出对教学工作的意见。去年开学初期，很多学生每次作业或测验都不及格，但在本学期开学前一次考试时，绝大多数学生各科成绩都在三、四分以上。根据该科领导上的估计，全科约有三分之一的学生可以在一年内完成原定两年的学习任务，达到工农速成中学毕业的水平。
