Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: Tibetan people across the country warmly support the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion, and unanimously condemn the treasonous crimes of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique.

Xia Rong Ga Bu Living Buddha, Governor of the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province and representative of the National People's Congress, said in a statement that the crimes of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique in betraying the motherland and undermining unity are extremely infuriating. He said: "After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, I went to Tibet twice and personally saw that religious beliefs and customs were protected and respected. The people love the Communist Party, love Chairman Mao, and love the People's Liberation Army. However, the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, disregarding the interests of the nation, colluded with imperialism for a long time, condoned bandits in harming the people, and obstructed the implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet in every possible way. In the end, they openly launched an armed rebellion, and their heinous crimes have reached their peak."

Xia Rong Ga Bu pointed out that this small group of reactionaries does not have the support of the people and will inevitably receive the punishment they deserve.

People from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Lanzhou and many ethnic minority areas of Gansu Province held many discussion meetings, and they all expressed their warm support for the State Council's order. Ce Ren Namu (Tibetan), Deputy Director of the Gansu Provincial Women's Federation, said at a discussion meeting that the Tibetan reactionary forces' treasonous activities in collusion with imperialism are intolerable by the law of the country. Cadres and the masses of De'uru City in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture held a discussion meeting on the 30th. Living Buddha Jia Mu Yang (Lobsang Jiumei) of the Labrang Monastery said: The Tibetan people will never forget the happy life given to them by the Communist Party and the state after liberation. It is completely correct for the central government to take resolute measures against traitors who sell out the interests of the motherland and the nation. People of all ethnic groups in Lintan, Taojiang, De'uru and other counties and cities also held discussion meetings to express their firm support for the State Council's order. At a discussion meeting held by Tibetan and Han workers of the Gannan Dairy Factory, Tibetan worker Dao Erde said: The Tibetan reactionary upper class's attempt to split the motherland and undermine the unity of all ethnic groups in the motherland is something that our Tibetan masses will never agree to. La Gao, a Tibetan commune member of the De'uru City Cooperative People's Commune, said that the Tibetan reactionary upper class openly launched an armed rebellion, which is contrary to the interests of the Tibetan people. We must wipe out these bandits cleanly and build a new Tibet well. The editorial department of "Gannan Daily" has also received many letters from Tibetan readers these days expressing their support for the State Council's order.

A'wang Jia Cuo, Jiangyang Bo Mu, Xia Ke Dao Deng, Suo Ren Ke Zeng, Vice Governors of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, and Yang Zhengchu (all Tibetan), Deputy Director of the Prefectural Women's Federation, all expressed their support for the State Council's order and condemned the heinous crimes of the Tibetan traitors in launching an armed rebellion against the will of the Tibetan people. A'wang Jia Cuo, who had been to Tibet in 1954, said: The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique has been carrying out various conspiracies since liberation. Now they have openly launched a rebellion, which is their own destruction. The demise of this reactionary clique is the beginning of building a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

Tibetan athletes who are preparing to participate in the Nanjing competition area of the Second Military Games of the People's Liberation Army in Nanjing expressed their warm support for the State Council's order. Female athlete Si Ju said: "The rebellion of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique is against the will of the people and is also intolerable to the Tibetan people." Another athlete, Si Ba Ta, whose father was captured by Tibetan bandits and had his eyes gouged out, and whose younger brother was also injured by bandits, was saved by the Communist Party and the People's Government, who healed their wounds. Si Ba Ta expressed his firm support for the State Council's order and for the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion.
