    Two Topics on the "Eight-Character Constitution"
     Elaborate and Skillful
   　Zhao Zhijun
     "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you will never be defeated," is a famous saying of military strategists. It means that understanding the enemy's and one's own situation, and using troops according to the specific circumstances, will lead to victory.
    In the current wheat field management, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production increase. However, the specific application of this "Eight-Character Constitution" also requires analyzing specific circumstances, like the gongs, drums, sheng, pipes, and strings in music, which must be used in perfect harmony to play a moving and beautiful song.
    When to water the wheat fields, when to fertilize, what kind of fertilizer to use, when to prevent frost, pests, and diseases, when to weed, etc., require the commanders on the agricultural front to have a better understanding of wheat growth and the need for water and fertilizer. To achieve this, one must observe the sky, the land, and the crops, carefully observing every moment; apply fertilizer skillfully according to the season and type, and irrigate skillfully in a timely and appropriate amount. Yujin People's Commune in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, has gained experience in these aspects. Last year, Yujin People's Commune had ten mu of high-yield experimental wheat fields, with an average yield of 1,153 jin per mu. What was the method? First, a skillful topdressing method of "three observations" and "five combinations"; second, a skillful irrigation method of "early first watering, late second watering, and timely third watering." The so-called skill here means applying according to specific circumstances.
    When implementing each item of the "Eight-Character Constitution," it should be adapted to local conditions, time, and crops, used freely, well, skillfully, and accurately, so that each of the "eight characters" can exert greater power. It is not enough to simply remember to water more, fertilize more, and weed more. Therefore, to be skillful, one must first be meticulous. Meticulousness breeds skill. Some places have put forward the slogan of "managing wheat like描龙画凤 (elaborately decorating)," which is the same idea.

    The Valuable "New Almanac"
　  Yang Jiaheng
    Opening the Shanxi Daily of March 11, the "Qin County New Almanac" immediately attracts all your attention. This "New Almanac" stipulates the agricultural affairs for the whole county in implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" throughout the year, with a central focus, tasks, required standards, completion time, and specific measures for each month. It has concretized and popularized the "Eight-Character Constitution."
    In the torrent of revolution, one should always be at the forefront of the waves, and should not become a tail-wagging follower. This requires political foresight and the ability to concretize the Party's policies. The "Eight-Character Constitution" originally comes from agricultural production practice and is a synthesis and generalization of agricultural science. To rely on it to guide practice and make agriculture a full-scale revolution, it is necessary to further strengthen investigation and research, analyze the changes in things themselves according to local conditions, concentrate the experience of the masses in production, and finally grasp the essence and hold the mainstream from the general form of things. Through a guiding principle, mobilize the soaring enthusiasm of the masses and converge it into a huge current, heading in one direction, to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.
    In the past, some people always thought that agricultural production plans were difficult to make, especially for the whole county. This is an "old almanac." Last year's unprecedented bumper harvest of grain and other crops in our country was achieved by relying on the overall planning of agricultural production and breaking the shackles of the old almanac. The "New Almanac" of Qin County is a further negation of the "old almanac." Being able to formulate one's own "New Almanac" and form revolutionary foresight should be regarded as a manifestation of a high degree of communist style.

    “八字宪法”二题
     讲细讲巧
   　赵志俊
     “知彼知己，百战百胜”，这是兵家的名言。意思是说了解了敌方和己方的情况，根据具体情况用兵才能取得胜利。
    在当前麦田管理中，要认真贯彻农业增产的“八字宪法”，但这“八字宪法”的具体运用，也要分析具体情况，好像奏乐中的锣、鼓、笙、管、弦，要用到恰恰合拍，才能奏出一部动人心弦的优美歌曲。
    麦田什么时候用水，什么时候用肥，用什么肥，什么时候防霜、防病虫害，什么时候锄草等等，要求农业战线上的指挥员更加了解小麦生长情况，水、肥需要情况。要做到这一点，就得看天看地看庄稼，每时每刻细观察；按期分类巧施肥，应时适量巧浇水。这几点陕西省临潼县雨金人民公社有了经验。雨金人民公社去年有十亩小麦的丰产试验田，平均亩产达到一千一百五十三斤。办法是什么？一是“三看”“五结合”的巧追肥方法；二是“头水早、二水迟、三水赶”的巧浇水方法。这里的所谓巧，就是根据具体情况运用的意思。
    在贯彻“八字宪法”的每一条的时候，都应该作到因地、因时、因作物而制宜，运用自如，用得好，用得巧，用得准确，使“八字”字字发挥更大的威力。如果光记下个多浇水、多施肥、多锄草，是不行的。因此，要想巧就首先得细。细能生巧。有的地方提出了“描龙画凤管小麦”的口号，就是这个意思。可贵的“新皇历”　杨家衡
    打开3月11日的山西日报，“沁县新皇历”立刻把你的全部视线都吸引住了。这个“新皇历”规定了全县一年贯彻“八字宪法”的农事，每月都有中心，有任务、要求标准、完成时间和具体措施。把“八字宪法”具体化、群众化了。
    在革命的洪流中，应该永远走在浪头的前面，而不应该成为随波逐流的尾巴主义者。这就要有政治预见，善于把党的方针政策具体化。“八字宪法”本来就是来自农业生产实践，是经过综合和概括了的农业科学。而要依靠它指导实践，使得农业全线大革命，还必须进一步加强调查研究，因地制宜地分析事物本身的变化，集中群众生产的经验，最后从事物的一般形态中抓住本质，紧握主流。通过一个纲把群众冲天的干劲调动起来，汇成一支巨流，奔向一个方向，实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    过去，总有人以为农业生产的计划不好订，尤其是订全县的更难。这是一种“老皇历”。去年我国粮食等作物空前大丰收的奇迹，就是依靠了对于农业生产的全面规划，打破了旧皇历的束缚，沁县这个“新皇历”就是对“旧皇历”的进一步否定。能够制订自己的“新皇历”，形成革命的预见，应该看作是具有高度共产主义风格的一个表现。
