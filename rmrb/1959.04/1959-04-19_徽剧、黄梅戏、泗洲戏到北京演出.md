　　Huiju Opera, Huangmei Opera, and Sizhou Opera to Perform in Beijing

　　(Our newspaper reports) The Anhui Province Opera Troupe (including Huiju Opera, Huangmei Opera, and Sizhou Opera) has arrived in Beijing and will perform more than twenty large and small plays in the capital at the end of this month, including the Huiju Opera's "Flooding the Seven Armies," "Silt River," "Hundred Flowers Presenting Sword," the Huangmei Opera's "Female Imperial Scholar," "Cowherd and Weaver Girl Smiling," "Chunxiang's School Frolic," and the Sizhou Opera's "Two Red Flags," "Returning to Mother's Home," and others. The Huiju Opera Troupe also brought Qingyang Tune's "Mill Meeting" and "Watching Daughter," which will also be performed at the same time.

　　Huiju Opera is an ancient opera genre in China, formed in southern Anhui in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, there were "Four Great Anhui Troupes" entering Beijing. It is an important component of the Peking Opera's predecessor. Before liberation, Anhui Huiju Opera was severely damaged. During the Anti-Japanese War, all Huiju troupes were forced to disband, and all Huiju Opera performers were scattered among the people, changing to other professions. After liberation, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attached great importance to Huiju Opera. Under the guidance of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" policy, the Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau visited and gathered more than ten old Huiju Opera artists scattered among the people, recruited children as students, and established the Anhui Provincial Huiju Opera Troupe. There are many Huiju Opera plays, although some of them are the same as Peking Opera and other opera genres, they have their own characteristics in terms of performance and singing.

　　Huangmei Opera, originally named Huangmei Tune, was a kind of folk opera in the Anqing area of ​​Anhui. In the past ten years since liberation, it has developed into a major local opera in Anhui. It has performed "The Fairy Couple," "Beating Pig Grass," and "Couples Watching Lanterns" in the capital, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places, and has been welcomed by audiences. The "Female Imperial Scholar" and "Cowherd and Weaver Girl Smiling" performed in Beijing this time are newly revised and created plays. The participating actors include Yan Fengying as the Seventh Fairy, Wang Shaofang and Pan Jingli as Dong Yong, and Zhang Yunfeng, etc.

　　Sizhou Opera is a drama genre popular on both sides of the Huai River in Anhui and loved by the masses. In 1957, it performed "Three Bends on the Cold Bridge" and "Picking Cotton" in the capital. This time, the famous actors of this drama genre, Li Baoqin and others, will perform excellent small plays such as "Two Red Flags" and "Returning to Mother's Home."

　　徽剧、黄梅戏、泗洲戏到北京演出
    本报讯　安徽省戏曲演出团（包括徽剧、黄梅戏、泗洲戏）现已来京，将于本月底在首都演出徽剧的“水淹七军”、“淤泥河”、“百花赠剑”，黄梅戏的“女驸马”、
  “牛郎织女笑开颜”、“春香闹学”以及泗洲戏的“两面红旗”、“走娘家”等大小二十多个剧目。徽剧团还带来青阳腔的“磨坊会”、“看女”等剧目，亦将同时演出。
    徽剧是我国一个古老的剧种，明末清初形成于安徽南部，清乾隆时期曾有“四大徽班”入京。它是京剧前身的重要组成部分。解放前，安徽徽剧遭到严重破坏，抗日战争时，所有徽班都被迫解散了，徽剧艺人全都流落民间，改习他业。解放后，中共安徽党委对徽剧非常重视，在党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针指导下，由安徽省文化局访集了十多个散落民间的徽剧老艺人，招收了儿童学员，成立安徽省徽剧团。徽剧的剧目很多，虽然其中某些剧目与京剧和其他剧种相同，但在表演、唱腔等方面都有其特色。
    黄梅戏原名黄梅调，本是安徽安庆地区的一种民间小戏，解放十年来，已发展成为安徽的地方大戏了。曾以“天仙配”、“打猪草”、
  “夫妻观灯”等剧目在首都、天津、武汉、广州等地演出，受到观众欢迎。这次来京演出的“女驸马”、
  “牛郎织女笑开颜”等，是最近整理和创作的新剧目。参加演出的演员，有扮七仙女的严凤英、扮董永的王少舫和潘璟琍、张云风等。
    泗洲戏是流行在安徽淮河两岸的一个为群众喜爱的剧种，1957年曾在首都演出过“三踡寒桥”、“拾棉花”等剧目，这次来京，系由该剧种著名演员李宝琴等演出“两面红旗”、“走娘家”等优秀小戏。
