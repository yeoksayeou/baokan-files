Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 3rd: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today, expressing its full support for the Soviet government's statement of March 29 regarding the tenth anniversary meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council.

    The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully agrees with the Soviet government's view of the North Atlantic Group and fully supports the Soviet government's proposals. The statement said that the Soviet proposals are very practical and feasible, stemming from the sincerity of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries.

    The statement said: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the regime of monopoly capitalists and militarists has been restored in West Germany, and West Germany has become the most dangerous hotbed of war in Europe. Therefore, the signing of a peace treaty with Germany has become one of the most pressing issues of the moment. Signing this treaty and turning West Berlin into a free city is in the interests of the German people and the European people. This will greatly ease tensions in Europe and help the smooth resolution of other international issues.

    The statement said: If the Soviet government's proposals for disengagement of armed forces in Europe or the establishment of arms limitation zones in Europe, as well as the Polish government's proposal for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, can be realized, it will ease tensions in Europe and will have a positive impact on the entire international situation. The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free security zone in the Far East and the Pacific region is a guarantee for maintaining peace in this region, which is in line with the ardent desire of the Vietnamese people and the Asian people.

    The statement concluded by saying that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will, together with other socialist countries and peace-loving countries in Asia, Africa, and the world, unswervingly fight against all conspiracies to provoke an atomic war, in order to contribute to the maintenance of peace and the development of friendly and mutually trusting relations.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 4th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic issued a statement on April 3rd, warmly welcoming the Soviet government's statement of March 29, and considering it an important step towards easing the current international tensions and a significant contribution to the cause of maintaining peace.

    The statement pointed out that all peace-loving people, including the Mongolian people, strongly condemn the North Atlantic Group and believe that the practice of organizing this military alliance to oppose other countries is a violation of the Potsdam Agreement and the United Nations Charter.

    The statement said that from the very beginning of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the world's righteous humanity has exposed its aggressive nature. The aggressive policies of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the German question have seriously affected the security and peaceful interests of the people of the world.

    The statement said that the world's progressive public supports the Soviet proposals for a peaceful settlement of the German issue and the West Berlin issue, and that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is an important step in promoting German reunification. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic believes that convening a summit meeting is currently the best way to resolve the German issue.

    The statement said that the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have repeatedly and unreasonably obstructed the Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations for many years, which is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter. The statement also condemned the American ruling clique for shamelessly supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique in illegally occupying China's seat in the United Nations.

    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, April 4th: The Romanian government issued a statement on April 3rd regarding the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, saying that in the ten years since the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it has proven its aggressive nature not only in military terms, but also in political, economic, and social aspects.

    The statement said that this organization is a tool for the leading groups in the United States to realize their plan for world hegemony, and it is also a major obstacle to the development of peaceful cooperation and mutual respect between countries. The "policy of strength" that the leading groups of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries continue to pursue, disregarding the peaceful aspirations of the peoples of all countries, will have disastrous consequences.

    The statement said that the Romanian government believes that the proposals in the Soviet government's statement of March 29 are realistic. The Soviet government's proposal to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization will greatly benefit the elimination of mutual distrust, create an atmosphere conducive to cooperation among European countries, and open up the prospect of abolishing these two military organizations, promoting the establishment of a European collective security system. The Soviet government's proposal that the participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization should not provide military, economic, or moral support to any aggressor will isolate aggressors and prevent the occurrence of acts of aggression.

    The statement said that the Romanian government also supports the Polish government's proposal for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

    The statement emphasized that the signing of a peace treaty with Germany and the end of the occupation regime in West Berlin are issues that can no longer be delayed. The Soviet proposal to ban the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons would be the first step towards eliminating atomic war, completely banning all weapons of mass destruction, and removing them from the arsenals of all countries.

    The statement said that the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers in Geneva and the subsequent summit meeting are a suitable opportunity to eliminate obstacles to understanding between East and West. The Romanian government will strive to improve international relations, unite all countries, and defend world peace.

    越蒙罗三国政府发表声明
    北大西洋集团“冷战”政策可以休矣
    实现苏联和平建议将有助于缓和国际局势
    新华社河内3日电　越南民主共和国政府今天发表声明，表示完全支持苏联政府3月29日就北大西洋公约理事会十周年例会所发表的声明。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府完全赞成苏联政府对北大西洋集团的看法，并且全力支持苏联政府的建议。声明说，苏联的建议是非常切实可行的，它是从各国之间的和平共处和友谊合作的诚意出发的。
    声明说：越南民主共和国政府认为，垄断资本家和军国主义分子的政权已经在西德复辟，西德已经变成欧洲最危险的战争温床。因此，对德和约的签订，已经成为当前最迫切的问题之一。签订这项和约和把西柏林变为自由城，是符合德国人民和欧洲人民的利益的。这样，将使欧洲的紧张局势大大缓和，有助于其他国际问题的顺利解决。
    声明说：苏联政府提出的关于使欧洲各武装部队脱离接触或在欧洲建立限制军备地区的建议，以及波兰政府提出的关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议能够实现的话，将会缓和欧洲的紧张局势，并且将对整个国际局势发生良好的影响。声明说，越南民主共和国政府认为，在远东和太平洋地区建立无原子武器安全地区，是维护这一地区的和平的保障，这是符合越南人民和亚洲人民的殷切愿望的。
    声明最后说，越南民主共和国将同其他社会主义国家以及亚非和全世界爱好和平的国家一起，坚定不移地为反对挑起原子战争的一切阴谋而斗争，以便对维护和平以及友好和互相信任的关系的发展作出贡献。
    新华社乌兰巴托4日电　蒙古人民共和国外交部3日发表声明，热烈欢迎苏联政府3月29日的声明，并且认为这是缓和当前国际紧张局势的重要步骤，是对维护和平事业的重大贡献。
    声明指出，包括蒙古人民在内的一切爱好和平人民严厉谴责北大西洋集团，并且认为组织这个军事联盟用来反对另一些国家的作法是违背波茨坦协定和联合国宪章的。
    声明说，从北大西洋公约组织开始成立的时候，世界正义人类就揭发了它的侵略本质。北大西洋公约组织成员国对于德国问题的侵略政策严重的影响了世界人民的安全及和平利益。
    声明说，世界进步公众支持苏联关于和平解决德国问题和西柏林问题的建议，缔结对德和约是促进德国统一的重要步骤。蒙古人民共和国政府认为召开最高级会议在目前是解决德国问题的最好方法。
    声明说，美、英、法等北大西洋公约组织成员国的代表多年来一再无理阻挠蒙古人民共和国加入联合国，这是粗暴地违背了联合国宪章。声明还谴责美国统治集团无耻地支持蒋介石集团非法占据中华人民共和国在联合国的席位。
    新华社布加勒斯特4日电　罗马尼亚政府3日就北大西洋公约组织理事会会议发表声明说，北大西洋公约组织成立十年来，不仅在军事方面，而且在政治、经济和社会各方面都证实了它的侵略性质。
    声明说，这个组织是美国领导集团实现其独霸世界计划的工具，也是发展各国间和平合作和互相尊重的主要障碍。北大西洋公约组织国家的领导集团所继续奉行的“实力政策”，无视各国人民的和平愿望，将会产生灾难性的后果。
    声明说，罗马尼亚政府认为苏联政府3月29日声明中的建议是现实的。苏联政府所建议的在北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织之间签订互不侵犯条约，将大有利于消除互不信任，创造有利于欧洲国家合作的气氛，并打开走向取消这两个军事组织的前途，促进建立欧洲集体安全体系。苏联政府建议北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约的参加国，不得对任何侵略者以军事、经济和道义上的支持，这将会孤立侵略者和阻止侵略行为的发生。
    声明说，罗马尼亚政府也支持波兰政府关于在中欧实现无核武器地区的建议。
    声明强调说，签订对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度是不能再拖延的问题了。苏联所建议的禁止原子武器和氢武器的试验，将是走向消除原子战争，彻底禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器和把它们从各国武库中取消的第一步。
    声明说，即将在日内瓦召开的外长会议和接着必须举行的政府首脑会议，是为消除阻碍东西方之间谅解的一个适当的机会。罗马尼亚政府将为改善国际关系和团结所有的国家、为保卫世界和平而努力。
