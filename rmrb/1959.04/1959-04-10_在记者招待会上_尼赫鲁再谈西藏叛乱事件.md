Xinhua News Agency, April 9th, New Delhi: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, at a press conference held in New Delhi on April 5th, once again spoke about India’s views and attitudes regarding the Tibetan rebellion. In his speech, he emphasized that "Tibet deeply touches our heartstrings." He said, "We are obviously concerned and interested in what is happening there, in the political developments there. We cannot ignore them, forget them, or disregard them."

Regarding the impact of India's attitude towards the Tibetan rebellion and the granting of asylum to the Dalai Lama on Sino-Indian relations, Nehru said, "Naturally, the situation is such that it has created a difficult, delicate, and embarrassing situation, and this situation may continue in various forms and ways. We have to consider various factors, the main factor, of course, is the security of our own country. After all, the primary duty of every government is to protect its country in various ways. The second factor is that we hope to maintain and continue to maintain friendly relations with China. The third factor is that we have strong feelings about the developments in Tibet. Sometimes, there are some contradictions between them. This is inevitable. Therefore, people must try their best to maintain a balance, make adjustments, and sometimes make difficult choices."

At this press conference, which lasted more than an hour, Nehru repeatedly mentioned India's "huge connection" with Tibet. He said that what actions India takes regarding what happens in Tibet "is a matter to be considered according to objective circumstances." He said, "Since our independence, we have certainly never had the slightest intention of interfering in Tibetan affairs. But we cannot give up our concern, call it, if you like, a concern in terms of emotion unrelated to politics."

Nehru stated that the "disappearance" of the agreement on China's peaceful liberation of Tibet does not affect the Sino-Indian agreement on trade and transportation between the Tibet region of China and India, "but I don’t know what consequences the developments in Tibet may have."

Nehru said, "May I say that, for various reasons, historical, emotional, practical, and present reasons, I have thought and I still think that it is extremely important for India and China to be friendly with each other, even if they may have great differences in their internal policies, and that neither country should interfere with the other, because such interference does not produce any beneficial results, even from the point of view of the person who wants to interfere, unless the result to be achieved is precisely the element of the Cold War - malice and anger. The Cold War will never change the other party’s opinion; it makes the other party more stubborn. Therefore, this is our basic policy, of course, it is always conditional on safeguarding India’s interests and the greater cause we cherish."

A reporter asked if he thought that China strictly adhered to the "Panchsheel" (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) on the Tibet issue. Nehru said, "I don’t think the issue of 'Panchsheel' arises directly in this regard. We can disagree with what a country has done or has not done. You can criticize almost any country on the grounds of not adhering to the Panchsheel principles, but in this specific matter, I don’t quite understand why this question arises."

A reporter asked him if he knew the danger caused by the fact that India's anti-communist forces were taking advantage of the recent events in China. Nehru replied, "The situation is naturally full of many difficult aspects, the worst being that it will bring the atmosphere of the Cold War that we have always tried to avoid into India. And when there is a Cold War atmosphere, the parties concerned do not consider issues calmly or rationally, but try to use the situation to benefit their ideas." He said, "When I spoke in the People’s House two days ago, I deliberately restrained myself in order to avoid increasing the heat of the Cold War. My views on certain issues are extremely strong, but I think people must try to be a little calmer."

In reply to the question of whether the Dalai Lama "will perform the duties of the Dalai Lama from India as the spiritual leader of Tibet," Nehru said, "How can he perform duties in Tibet when he is in India?" A reporter asked Nehru whether he would ask the Dalai Lama not to engage in any political activities during his stay in India. Nehru said, "Naturally, no one in India can, nor is expected to, engage in such political activities." He said, "We do not want to impose what could be called inappropriate constraints on him. But we must discuss this issue with him, and I am sure he would not want to take any steps here that would embarrass us and himself."

Nehru said that he had received a letter from the Dalai Lama when he arrived at the Indian border, and he replied with a short letter of greeting. He also said that he "will certainly meet the Dalai Lama at some place at some time." He said that the Dalai Lama "will not necessarily live near the border, nor will he necessarily go to southern India."

### 在记者招待会上  尼赫鲁再谈西藏叛乱事件

    在记者招待会上
    尼赫鲁再谈西藏叛乱事件
    新华社9日讯　新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁4月5日在新德里举行的记者招待会上又一次谈到印度对西藏叛乱事件的看法和态度。他在谈话中强调说，“西藏深深打动我们的心弦”。他说，“我们对于那里发生的事情，对于那里出现的政治发展显然是关切的和感兴趣的。我们不能忽视它们，遗忘它们或者不顾它们”。
    在谈到印度方面对西藏叛乱事件的态度并且表示给予达赖喇嘛以避难权对中印关系所产生的影响时，尼赫鲁说，“自然，情况是这样，已经造成了困难、微妙和令人为难的局势，并且这种局势可能以各种形式和方式继续下去。我们不得不考虑各种因素，主要的因素当然是我们本国的安全。毕竟，每个政府的首要的职责是用各种办法保护它的国家。第二个因素是，我们希望同中国保持和继续保持友好关系。第三个因素是我们对西藏的事态发展抱有强烈情绪。有时候，它们之间存在某种矛盾。这是不可避免的。因此，人们必须尽力设法保持平衡、进行调整和有时作困难的抉择。”
    在这次举行了一个多小时的记者招待会上，尼赫鲁再次讲到印度同西藏的“巨大的联系”。他说，印度对西藏发生的事情采取什么行动，“那是要按照客观情况来考虑的一个问题。”他说，“自从我们独立以来，我们肯定地从来没有想要丝毫干涉西藏事务的念头。可是我们不能够放弃我们的关切，如果你高兴的话，称它为同政治无关的感情方面的关切”。
  尼赫鲁表示，关于中国和平解放西藏办法的协议的“消失”并不影响中印两国有关中国西藏地方与印度之间的通商和交通协定，“但是我不知道西藏的事态发展可能有什么后果”。
    尼赫鲁说，“我是否可以说，由于各种理由，历史的、情感上的、实际的和当今的理由，我曾经想到而且我现在还想到，印度和中国彼此友好是极为重要的，即使它们在它们的对内政策方面可能有很大的不同，而且，两国都不应当干涉对方，因为这种干涉并不产生任何有利的结果，即使从想要干涉的人的观点来看也是这样，除非所要达到的结果恰恰是冷战的要素——恶意与愤怒。冷战决不会使对方改变看法；它使对方更加固执。因此，这就是我们的基本政策，当然，它始终是以护卫印度的利益和我们珍贵的更大的事业为条件的。”
    有记者问，他是否认为中国在西藏问题方面严格遵守了“潘查希拉”（和平共处五项原则），尼赫鲁说，“我认为在这方面并不直接产生‘潘查希拉’的问题。我们可以不同意一个国家已经做的或没有做的事。你可以以不遵守潘查希拉原则为理由对差不多任何国家进行批评，但是在这件具体事情上，我不大明白为什么产生这个问题。”
    记者问他是否知道印度的反共力量利用在中国的最近事件这一点所引起的危险，尼赫鲁回答说，“局势自然是充满了许多困难的方面的，最坏的是，它会把我们一向设法避免的冷战气氛带入印度来。而且当存在冷战气氛时，有关各方就不沉着地或者理智地考虑问题了，而是设法利用局势，使它有利于他们的想法。”他说，“两天前我在人民院讲话时，我故意克制自己，为的是避免增加冷战的热度。我对某些问题的看法是极其强烈的，但是我认为，人们必须设法冷静一点。”
    在答复关于达赖喇嘛“是否会作为西藏的精神领袖从印度执行达赖喇嘛的职务”的问题时，尼赫鲁说，“当他在印度的时候，他怎么能够在西藏执行职务呢”。有记者问尼赫鲁是否将要求达赖喇嘛在印度居住期间不要参与任何政治活动。尼赫鲁说，“自然，在印度的任何人不能、也预期不会进行这样的政治活动”。他说，“我们并不想对他进行可以称为是不适宜的约束。可是我们必须同他讨论这个问题，并且我确信，他不会希望在这里采取任何会使我们和他本人为难的步骤。”
    尼赫鲁说，他曾经收到了达赖在到达印度国境时写给他的信，他复了一封很短的问候信。他还说他
  “当然会在某一时候在某地”会见达赖。他说达赖“不见得会住在边界附近，也不见得会去印度南部”。
