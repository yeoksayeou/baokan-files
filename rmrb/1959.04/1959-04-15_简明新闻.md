　　Checking Yellow River Flood Control Work
　　To continue implementing the policy of being prepared and taking early action, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Shandong and Henan Provincial Yellow River Affairs Bureaus jointly formed a Yellow River Flood Control Inspection Team to inspect flood control work in various areas along the river.
　　The content of this inspection includes: the condition of dikes, culverts, river channel silting and scouring changes, flood control organization after the people's communes, flood control materials, and other related information. The 1959 Yellow River flood control plan will be formulated through inspection and research.

　　Artificial Rainfall Overcomes Spring Drought
　　Under the unified organization of the Jirem League Committee of Inner Mongolia and the water conservancy and meteorological departments, and with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army Unit 2135 and Jilin Province, the league successfully conducted its first artificial rainfall in history. After airplanes scattered dry ice flakes over the northeast of Tongliao, moderate rain fell throughout the vast area of the league for as long as two hours, with an average rainfall of about four millimeters in various places. This rainfall created favorable conditions for spring plowing in the league.

After a month of maritime combat, they caught a total of 2,351,577 catties of fish and shrimp, exceeding the county's first quarter plan of 1.5 million catties. They went to sea one month earlier than last year. In this fishing operation, the commune promoted the operating techniques of "three diligences" (diligently checking nets, diligently repairing nets, diligently sorting catch) and "four fasts" (fast rowing of sampans, fast sorting of catch, fast tying of nets, fast setting of nets), which improved productivity.
