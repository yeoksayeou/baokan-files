Who Cares About Our Suffering?

To the Editor:

Who wouldn't be grateful to a lifesaver?

Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the phenomenon of ordinary people dying from illness due to lack of timely treatment was extremely serious. In the northern suburbs of Lhasa, there was the Sera Kyilung graveyard (Tibetans generally do not practice burial, but rather sky burial, that is, feeding corpses to vultures). There were flocks of large vultures there, waiting to eat human flesh. I used to be a lama at Sera Monastery, and when I was young, my teacher often took me to the graveyard to chant scriptures for the dead, so I witnessed that tragic situation. At that time, at least four people, and as many as eight or nine dead people, were sent to the graveyard for sky burial every morning. Because so many people died, the vultures were so full that they couldn't even fly.

Was this abnormal death rate due to a lack of doctors and medicine? No, there were many highly skilled doctors in Tibet, but because the vast majority of Tibetans were oppressed and exploited, impoverished and struggling to survive, how could they afford to seek medical treatment?

After liberation, the Lhasa People's Hospital was established, providing free treatment to the masses, deeply loved by the people. Every day, hundreds and thousands of men, women, old and young, receive excellent treatment here, freed from their ailments. I myself am one of the thousands of beneficiaries. My heart disease was cured at the Lhasa People's Hospital. Thanks to good medical equipment and free treatment for the vast Tibetan people, the health of the people has been guaranteed, and the mortality rate has been greatly reduced. Now, apart from the occasional death due to old age or incurable diseases, there are no longer so many dead people being sent to feed the vultures every day. The era of flocks of vultures gorging on human flesh is like the eastward-flowing river, never to return.

The Lhasa People's Hospital is hung with red flags and gifts given to the hospital by patients. These banners express the sincere gratitude of the Tibetan people to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

The traitors claim that they are safeguarding the interests of the Tibetan people and are representatives of the Tibetan people's interests. However, even from the perspective of how people's illnesses are treated, it can be clearly seen: who truly cares for and is concerned about the suffering of the Tibetan people? Who is the representative of the Tibetan people's interests? In the face of the facts, their lies fall apart.

After liberation, the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army, and the Han elder brothers have done so much for us Tibetan people that we can't express it all. The above is just one of thousands of examples. The Tibetan people, with sincere hearts, will forever be grateful for the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    谁关心我们的疾苦编辑同志：
    对于救命恩人，谁不感恩戴德？
    在西藏和平解放以前，普通人民患病因为得不到适时的治疗而死亡的现象是极其严重的。拉萨北郊有个色拉夏坟场（藏族一般不是土葬，而是天葬，即把死尸喂雕），那里大雕成群，专门等着吃死人肉。我过去是色拉寺的喇嘛，年轻时师父常带我到坟地去为死者念经，所以我曾目睹那悲惨的情况。那时，每天上午至少有四人，多至八九个死人，送到坟地天葬。由于死的人太多，雕吃的太饱，连飞都飞不动了。
    这种不正常的死亡是由于没有医生和药品吗？不是的，西藏有很多医术很高的医生，但是由于绝大多数藏族人民受着压迫和剥削，一贫如洗，难以为生，哪有钱去求医治病？
    解放后成立了拉萨人民医院，免费给群众治疗，深受群众的爱戴。每天都有成百上千的男女老幼在这里得到良好的治疗，摆脱了缠身的病魔。我自己就是千百个受惠者中的一个。我的心脏病就是在拉萨人民医院治好的。由于有了良好的医药设备，广大藏族人民得到免费治疗，所以保障了人民身体健康，死亡率大为降低。现在除了偶而有个别因年老或得了不治之症而死的外，每天也没有那么多的死人去喂雕了，坟场上再也见不到成群结队的大雕，它们饱食人肉的时代如同东逝的流水，一去不复返了。
    在拉萨人民医院挂满了病人赠送给病院的红旗和礼物，这些锦旗表达了藏族人民感谢共产党，感谢毛主席的诚挚心意。
    叛国分子口口声声说他们是为了维护藏族人民的利益，是藏族人民利益的代表者，然而就从对待人民的疾病问题上，也可以清楚地看到：谁真正地爱护和关怀藏族人民的疾苦？谁是藏族人民利益的代表？在事实面前，他们的谎言不攻自破。
    解放后，共产党、毛主席、解放军和汉族老大哥，对我们藏族人民的恩情是说不完的，上面说的只是千百个例子中的一个。藏族人民以一颗赤诚的心，永远感谢党和毛主席的恩情。
