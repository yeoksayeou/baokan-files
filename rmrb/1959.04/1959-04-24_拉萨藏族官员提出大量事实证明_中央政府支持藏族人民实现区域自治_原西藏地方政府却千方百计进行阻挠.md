Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 23rd (By our reporter Hu Guocheng): Who obstructed the Tibetan people from rapidly realizing national regional autonomy? Was it the former Tibet local government and a small number of upper-class reactionary groups? Or was it the Central People's Government, as stated in the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" recently issued in Tezpur, India?

At the Lhasa rally on the 22nd, where people of all ethnic groups warmly celebrated the third anniversary of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, this reporter interviewed several Tibetan leaders of the Preparatory Committee currently in Lhasa and progressive officials of the former Tibet local government to ask them about the truth of the matter.

These leaders and officials included: Sampo Tenzin Dondup, Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee and former Kalon of the Tibet local government; Trijang Losang Tenzin, former Deputy Director of the General Office of the Preparatory Committee and current Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee; and Jiangjin Soinam Gyalpo, Director of the Culture and Education Department.

As everyone knows, the Preparatory Committee was established based on the decision of the Seventh Meeting of the State Council. Before the establishment of this institution, representatives of the Central People's Government had fully consulted with the former Tibet local government, the Panchen Kampotilya Committee, and the People's Liberation Committee of the Qamdo area. Everyone unanimously agreed to establish this institution.

After the Preparatory Committee was established, over 90% of the members were Tibetan, including representatives from the above three parties, as well as representatives from major temples, major religious sects, social elites, and people's organizations in the Tibet region. The representatives of the former Tibet local government accounted for a large proportion of the committee members. The cadres sent by the Central Government to participate in the work of the Preparatory Committee never exceeded one-tenth. In the various institutions under the Preparatory Committee and the offices of various Dzong (equivalent to counties), the proportion of officials of the former Tibet local government and Tibetan cadres was even greater, and the majority of responsible officials were local officials of the former Tibet local government and Tibetan people. Moreover, the official documents of the Preparatory Committee were mainly in Tibetan. All of this fully demonstrated the Central People's Government's respect for the Tibetan people's right to realize regional autonomy and its determination to patiently plan for Tibet's regional autonomy.

In the past three years, the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee held a total of twenty-seven meetings, all of which, except for two, were presided over by the Dalai Lama himself.

The former Tibet local government and the upper-class reactionary group consistently adopted a double-dealing approach to the work of the Preparatory Committee and carried out sabotage in secret. The officials interviewed by this reporter said: At the same time as the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1956, the former Tibet local government, while superficially supporting the establishment of the Preparatory Committee, expanded its own government agencies, promoted noble officials on an exceptional basis, and bought them off so that they would not participate in the work of the Preparatory Committee, attempting to create a situation of "independence" for the Tibet local government and use this to confront the Preparatory Committee. This reactionary act not only showed that the reactionary officials of the former Tibet local government violated the Seventeen-Article Agreement but also showed that they had long been plotting to carry out the criminal activities of so-called Tibet "independence."

Sampo Tenzin Dondup and other senior officials of the former Tibet local government used their familiarity with the situation and the facts they had witnessed to give this reporter some examples.

On December 30, 1957, the 23rd meeting of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee passed a resolution proposed by the Dalai Lama to exempt Tibetan staff and students in the Tibet region from the corvée labor tax. "Corvée labor tax" was one of the most cruel feudal exploitation methods of the Tibetan reactionary group against the Tibetan people. For centuries, Tibetan nobles, monasteries, and serf owners could order the laborers under their jurisdiction to serve and enslave them without compensation at any time. This resolution of the Preparatory Committee was welcomed by the broad masses of the Tibetan people. However, the former Tibet local government and the upper-class reactionary group used various excuses to delay its implementation and secretly spread rumors among the masses, insisting that "the corvée labor system is a good system" and that "anyone who dares to ask for reduction or exemption will be killed," etc. They disregarded the resolution of the Preparatory Committee and stubbornly continued to cruelly exploit Tibetan staff and students participating in work or study without limit, based on their ownership of serfs or land rental relationships.

In order to cultivate a large number of Tibetan cadres necessary for Tibet's local autonomy, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region decided to establish Tibetan cadre schools and training classes, select outstanding Tibetan children to study in the mainland, and recommend representatives of various Tibetan social classes to visit Beijing and other places. The former Tibet local government not only did not enthusiastically support these progressive measures but also made various criticisms and obstructions. They delayed submitting the list of candidates, preventing Tibetan progressive people and Tibetan children from getting the opportunity for further study. After 1957, the former Tibet local government intensified its public threats to the families of Tibetan cadres working in the Preparatory Committee and even secretly instructed people to beat and scold these Tibetan cadres. On the eve of the Lhasa rebellion, some reactionary Kalons of the former Tibet local government openly forced Tibetan cadres working in the Preparatory Committee to sign the so-called "Declaration of Independence" at the pseudo "People's Conference," and coerced them to put their fingerprints on guarantees and provide so-called "reliable" guarantors to guarantee that they would no longer go to the Preparatory Committee to work, forcing them to publicly declare that they would break off relations with the Preparatory Committee.

Sampo also cited another fact to illustrate how the former Tibet local government obstructed the Preparatory Committee from caring for and sympathizing with ordinary people in Tibet. He said that the Central People's Government had allocated 800,000 yuan in 1954 to relieve the victims of the flood in the Gyangzê area of Tibet. Later, the funds were not used up, and the Preparatory Committee decided to use the surplus to build a batch of bungalows for the poor and beggars in Lhasa so that these people would no longer have to live in the open or in dilapidated tents. However, the reactionary officials of the former Tibet local government, while expressing their agreement at the Preparatory Committee meeting, secretly took advantage of the labor shortage in Lhasa to indiscriminately recruit laborers, saying that they were also carrying out a certain construction project, and delayed the implementation of this decision. As a result, even today, the poor people in Lhasa still live in the open or in dilapidated tents.

From the above facts, people can clearly see who obstructed the Tibetan people from implementing national regional autonomy! Who hoped to permanently not change all kinds of backward, reactionary, and dark rule!

    拉萨藏族官员提出大量事实证明
    中央政府支持藏族人民实现区域自治
    原西藏地方政府却千方百计进行阻挠
    新华社拉萨23日电　本社记者胡国城报道：是谁阻挠了西藏人民迅速实现民族区域自治？是前西藏地方政府和少数上层反动集团呢？还是最近在印度提斯浦尔发表的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中所说的是中央人民政府呢？
    在22日拉萨各族人民热烈庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会成立三周年的大会上，记者访问了目前在拉萨的筹委会几位藏族负责人和前西藏地方政府的进步官员，请他们谈谈事实的真相。
    这些负责人和官员包括：筹委会常委、原西藏地方政府噶伦桑颇·才旺仁增，原筹委会办公厅副主任、现任筹委会常委崔科·登珠泽仁，文教处处长江金·索朗杰布等。
    大家知道，筹委会的成立是根据国务院第七次会议的决定成立的。在成立这个机构以前，中央人民政府的代表事先曾和原西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会以及昌都地区人民解放委员会等三方面进行了充分协商，大家对成立这一机构是一致同意了的。
    筹委会成立后，委员中90％以上的成员是藏族人士，包括上述三个方面的代表以及西藏地区各主要寺庙、各主要教派、社会贤达和人民团体的代表，而原西藏地方政府的代表在委员人数中又占着很大的比重。中央派来参加筹委会工作的干部，从来就没有超过十分之一。在筹委会所属各机构以及各基巧（相当于专区）和宗（相当于县）的办事处中，原西藏地方政府官员和藏族干部所占比例还要大得多，负责官员也绝大多数是原西藏地方政府的地方官员和藏族人士，而且筹委会的公文来往都是以藏文为主。所有这些都充分说明了中央人民政府尊重西藏藏族人民实现区域自治的权利和耐心筹划西藏区域自治的决心。
    三年以来筹委会常委会共开了二十七次会议，除了其中两次以外，都是在达赖喇嘛亲自主持下召开的。
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团对筹委会的工作一贯采取阳奉阴违的手段，并在暗中进行破坏。记者访问的这些官员们说：就在1956年西藏自治区筹备委员会成立的同时，前西藏地方政府一方面在表面上拥护筹委会的成立，另一方面却扩充自己的政府机构，破格地大批提升贵族官员，收买他们不要参加筹委会的工作，企图造成西藏地方政府“独立”的局面，并以此而与筹委会相对抗。这种反动行径不但说明了原西藏地方政府的反动官员违反了十七条协议，并说明了他们早已在蓄谋策划进行所谓西藏“独立”的罪恶活动。
    桑颇·才旺仁增等原西藏地方政府高级官员，以自己熟悉的情况和目睹的事实，对记者举了一些事例。
    1957年12月30日，筹委会第二十三次常委会通过了一项由达赖喇嘛提议的免去西藏地区藏族工作人员和学员所负担的人役税的决议。“人役税”是西藏反动集团对西藏人民最残酷的封建剥削之一。几世纪以来，西藏的贵族、寺院和农奴主可以随时命令其管辖下的劳动人民无偿地供他们使唤和奴役。筹委会的这项决议曾得到了西藏广大人民的欢迎。可是原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团却利用种种借口拖延执行，并在群众中暗中散播流言，硬说“人役制是一种良好的制度”、如果“谁敢要求减免，就杀死他”等等。他们无视筹委会的决议，仍然顽固地依据对所属农奴的人身所有权或土地租贷关系，无限制地对参加工作或学习的藏族工作人员和学员进行残酷剥削。
    为了大量培养西藏地方自治所必需的藏族干部，西藏自治区筹委会曾决定成立藏族干部学校和训练班，选派优秀藏族子弟去内地学习，并推选藏族各阶层的代表到北京等地参观访问。对这些进步措施，原西藏地方政府不但不热心支持，反而多方挑剔和阻挠，他们拖延提出人选名单，不让藏族进步人士和藏族子弟得到深造的机会。1957年以后，前西藏地方政府更变本加厉地公开威胁参加筹委会工作的藏族干部家属，甚至暗中指使人打骂这些藏族干部。在拉萨叛乱前夕，原西藏地方政府一些反动噶伦在伪“人民会议”上，公然强迫参加筹委会工作的藏族干部在所谓“独立宣言”上签字，并要挟他们在保证书上画押和提供所谓“可靠”的保人。来担保他们不再到筹委会去办公，硬要他们公开表示和筹委会断绝关系。
    桑颇还举了另一个事实，说明原西藏地方政府如何阻挠筹委会去关心和同情西藏的普通老百姓。他说，中央人民政府曾在1954年拨出八十万元来救济西藏江孜地区受水灾的难民，以后这笔费用没有用完，筹委会决定用余款为拉萨的贫民和乞丐建立一批平房，使这些人可以不再住在露天或破烂不堪的帐篷里。可是，原西藏地方政府的反动官员一面在筹委会上表示同意，一面暗中利用拉萨人力缺乏的情况滥召民工，说也要进行某项建设，迟迟不执行这项决定。以至直到今天，拉萨市的贫民还住在露天或破烂不堪的帐篷里。
    从以上事实中人们可以清楚地看到，究竟是谁阻挠了西藏人民实行民族区域自治！究竟是谁希望永久不改变种种落后、反动、黑暗的统治！
