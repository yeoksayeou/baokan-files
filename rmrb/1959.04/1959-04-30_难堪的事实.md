    "An Embarrassing Fact"
    Tian Ma
    After Nehru admitted that the three letters written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan were genuine, the British "News Chronicle" published a message on April 25 stating that the confirmation of these letters was an "embarrassing fact." Embarrassing, embarrassing, the lies are bankrupt, the three letters are irrefutable evidence! Two "statements," the fake goods exposed: drafted by others, read aloud by others. Embarrassing, embarrassing, difficult to argue, only to blame the original, miscalculated abacus. Should not have presumptuously issued documents on behalf; trying to fix the loopholes, but only making it worse! Embarrassing, embarrassing, ugly, ugly, sad, sad, difficult, difficult! Three letters, irrefutable evidence! All conspiracies and tricks are finished!

    “难堪的事实”
    天马
    在尼赫鲁承认达赖喇嘛写给谭冠三将军的三封信是真的以后，英国“新闻纪事报”在4月25日登载了一条消息说，这些信件的证实是一件“难堪的事实”。难堪难堪，谎言破产，三封信件，铁证如山！两次“声明”，假货揭穿：别人起草，别人代念。难堪难堪，有口难辩，只怪当初，错打算盘。不该冒昧，代发文件；去补漏洞，越补越烂！难堪难堪，难看难看，难过难过，难办难办！三封信件，铁证如山！阴谋鬼计，一齐完蛋！
