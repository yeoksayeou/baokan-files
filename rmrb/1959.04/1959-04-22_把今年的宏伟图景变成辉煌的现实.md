Turning This Year's Grand Vision into a Glorious Reality
NPC Plenary Session Hears Vice Premier Li Fuchun's Report on the Draft National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's Report on the Draft State Final Accounts and Budget, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's Report on the Work of the NPC Standing Committee

Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: The First Session of the Second National People's Congress held a plenary meeting this afternoon, hearing reports on the draft national economic plan for 1959, reports on the state final accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and reviewed and approved the report on the examination of the qualifications of deputies.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Soong Ching Ling, Panchen Erdeni Choskyi Gyaltsen, Liu Bocheng, Lin Feng, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Jiageng, Zhou Jianren, Xu Deheng, Zhou Wenjiang, Zhou Shuli, Chen Shaokuan.

The "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959" given by Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Planning Commission, and the "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959" given by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, showcased the grand vision for the development of the national economy in our country in 1959, fully demonstrating that the national economic plan for 1959 is a plan for continuing the Great Leap Forward based on the Great Leap Forward of last year. They called on the people of the whole country to mobilize, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to uphold the Party's general line for building socialism, to utilize and promote the successful experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, to go all out, aim high, and strive for the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report began at 3:00 PM. In his report, he first explained the arrangements for my country's national economic plan in 1959. He said that the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC discussed the main tasks and guidelines for developing the national economy in 1959, and put forward four indicators for steel, coal, grain, and cotton. This is the main basis for compiling the draft plan for 1959. This draft plan has been discussed and approved successively by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC and the plenary meeting of the State Council.

In 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural output will increase by 40% compared to 1958

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that the draft plan stipulates that in 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural output in our country will be 287 billion yuan, an increase of 40% compared to 1958, i.e., an increase of 82 billion yuan.

In terms of industrial production, Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that the industrial production plan for 1959 first focused on the development of raw materials, materials industries, and fuel and power industries. To be consistent with the targets of 18 million tons of steel and 380 million tons of coal, the plan stipulates that this year's pig iron production will increase from 13.69 million tons in 1958 to 23 million tons, power generation will increase from 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours in 1958 to 40 billion kilowatt-hours, and cement production will increase from 9.3 million tons in 1958 to 12.5 million tons. The output of other products such as crude oil, timber, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, and soda ash will also increase significantly. The increased output of these products in 1959 will be higher than the increased output in 1958. In the machine manufacturing industry, this year's output of mining equipment, coal washing equipment, coking equipment, steel rolling equipment, and power generation equipment will all increase several times.

Due to the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and heavy industry, it is possible and necessary to develop light industry more rapidly in 1959. The plan stipulates that this year's output of products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, edible vegetable oil, sugar, and crude salt will increase by 25% to 67% compared to last year.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that the industrial production plan for 1959 implemented the policy of simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, especially the development of raw material industries, and the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward. In 1959, the output value of the means of production industry will increase by 46% compared to 1958, and the output value of the means of subsistence industry will increase by 34%.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that the task of developing agriculture in 1959 is to use the greatest efforts to strive for a leap in grain production to 1,050 billion catties, a leap in cotton production to 100 million dan, to realize ahead of schedule the grain and cotton production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, and to achieve universal development in various economic crops, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. On the basis of vigorously increasing grain and cotton production, diversified operations in agriculture should be implemented to develop the commodity production of people's communes.

The main way to increase the production of grain, cotton, and other crops is to increase the yield per unit area. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain a certain planting area and to expand the cultivated land of state-owned farms in a planned way. The national planting area plan for 1959 is 2.1 billion mu, of which the planting area for grain is 1.6 billion mu, and the planting area for cotton is 100 million mu. The plan also stipulates to expand the irrigated area by 100 million mu.

In 1959, the investment in capital construction will increase by 26% compared to 1958

Regarding capital construction, Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that the total amount of state investment in capital construction in 1959 is planned to be 27 billion yuan, an increase of 26% compared to 1958. In 1959, investment will be more concentrated in the industrial and transportation sectors. 42.7% of the total investment will be allocated to local areas, a significant increase compared to previous years.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that the transportation industry, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings will also have great development this year. The total retail sales of social commodities in 1959 is planned to be 65 billion yuan, an increase of 19% compared to 1958. The supply of grain, meat, edible vegetable oil, aquatic products, salt, cotton cloth, knitwear, and other daily necessities supplied to the people through commercial institutions will all increase compared to 1958.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out that the national economic plan for 1959 is a plan for continuing the Great Leap Forward. It is necessary to achieve such a continued Great Leap Forward plan, and it is also possible through the efforts and struggles of the people of the whole country. In his report, he listed many favorable conditions for achieving this year's continued Great Leap Forward. He said that the Great Leap Forward in industrial production in 1958 provided favorable material and technical conditions for the continued leap forward in 1959; due to the realization of the people's commune system in rural areas, agricultural productivity has been further liberated; in the Great Leap Forward in 1958, all fronts accumulated a large amount of technical and organizational experience. This year, we will continue to receive strong assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun emphasized that the most important favorable condition for realizing the 1959 plan is that the broad masses of cadres and people have raised their political awareness, strengthened their political unity, and mastered the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, as well as a set of "walking on two legs" policies.

Immediately launch a national mass movement to increase production and practice economy on all fronts of the national economy

Vice Premier Li Fuchun then said that in order to ensure the completion and strive for the overfulfillment of the 1959 plan, the most important link in the various organizational measures that must be taken at present is to immediately launch a national mass movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution to increase production and practice economy on all fronts of the national economy.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun then separately described the specific tasks of launching the movement to increase production and practice economy on all fronts of the national economy. He emphasized that no matter which front it is on, the requirements for launching the movement to increase production and practice economy must be the unity of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and must be the unity of quantity, quality, and safety. Never emphasize one aspect to the neglect of another. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, we must constantly and conscientiously pay attention to improving the quality of products and projects, and ensure the safety of production, construction, and transportation.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that in order to launch the mass movement to increase production and practice economy in a vigorous and thorough manner, it is necessary to further mobilize the masses. The combination of mass movement and centralized leadership is a consistent policy of the Party and the state. The large-scale development of the mass movement requires us to strengthen centralized leadership in order to better combine the strength of the central government, local governments, and enterprises, work together with one heart and one mind, and complete the various tasks stipulated in the national plan, and "line up" according to priorities, first ensuring the completion of the main tasks.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said at the end of his report that the plan for developing the national economy in 1959 is a grand, arduous, but achievable plan. Let us mobilize, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, to uphold the Party's general line for building socialism, to utilize and promote the successful experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, to go all out, aim high, and strive for the continued leap forward in 1959. We must complete this plan, and we will certainly be able to complete this plan.

After a 20-minute break, Vice Premier Li Xiannian continued to give his report. Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that as a result of the implementation of the state financial budget in 1958, both income and expenditure greatly exceeded the original expectations; the scale of income and expenditure and the growth rate far exceeded any previous year. This is the victory of the Chinese people's year of hard work.

In 1958, both fiscal revenue and expenditure increased by 35% compared to 1957, with a surplus of 900 million yuan

Vice Premier Li Xiannian reported that the results of the final accounts of state financial revenue and expenditure in 1958 were: revenue of 41.86 billion yuan, equivalent to 126.1% of the original budget of 33.2 billion yuan, an increase of 35% compared to 1957, while the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period was only 12%, and the fastest growth in 1953 and 1956 was only 23% and 16%. Expenditure in 1958 was 40.96 billion yuan, equivalent to 123.4% of the original budget of 33.2 billion yuan, an increase of 35% compared to 1957. The part of the expenditure that exceeded the budget was mainly used to expand the scale of capital construction. The total investment in capital construction this year was 21.4 billion yuan, an increase of 70% compared to the previous year. In 1958, the state financial revenue and expenditure offset each other, with a surplus of 900 million yuan, which is a surplus belonging to the local budget and will be carried over by the local government to continue to be used in 1959.

State-owned enterprises' income increased significantly, and farmers' burdens were relatively reduced

Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out in his report that the fundamental guarantee for the leap in production and the economic upswing in 1958 was the leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, and the great development of the mass line. At the same time, it was also inseparable from the strong assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. He said that the reason why the state finance achieved such great achievements in 1958 ultimately came from the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian emphasized that the reason why fiscal revenue increased so rapidly in 1958 was by no means due to increasing the burden on the people. In the state fiscal revenue in 1958, taxes and profits paid by state-owned enterprises and institutions accounted for 83.9%, while payments from rural people's communes accounted for only 13.7%, and payments from other aspects accounted for 2.4%. The proportion of farmers' burden in the total value of agricultural output was 10% in 1957, and it decreased to 7% in 1958. That is to say, the burden on farmers was relatively reduced, not increased.

He also pointed out that market prices in my country were also stable in 1958. From the perspective of market supply, since the autumn of 1958, some non-staple foods and certain daily industrial products in cities have experienced a situation of short supply and slight tension, which is mainly because the urban employment area has expanded, the number of employees has increased, and the demand has increased. At the same time, due to the establishment of public canteens and other public welfare undertakings by the people's communes, the lives of farmers have improved, and the consumption of non-staple foods in rural areas has increased, so the part supplied to cities has relatively decreased; due to the increase in farmers' income, the demand for daily industrial products in rural areas has also increased. Therefore, although industrial and agricultural products increased and the quantity of market commodity supply expanded in 1958, it still could not keep up with the growth in demand in all aspects. He said that in a country with a large population and a large demand like ours, and in such a huge social transformation as the Great Leap Forward in the national economy and the people's communes, it is difficult to completely avoid certain temporary difficulties in economic life. However, despite the occurrence of some situations of short supply, we still maintained the stability of market prices.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian emphasized that ensuring the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure on the basis of developing production is an important principle that our country's financial and economic work has always followed. The reason why our country has always been able to maintain the stability of the currency value and the stability of market prices lies here.

In 1959, fiscal revenue increased by 24.2%, expenditure increased by 27%, and revenue and expenditure were balanced

When reporting on the arrangement of the state budget for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian said: To adapt to the continued Great Leap Forward in the national economy this year, the draft state budget for 1959 that has now been compiled is a budget that taps potential and supports the all-round leap forward; it is a budget that implements the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" and mobilizes the enthusiasm of all aspects under the principle of centralized leadership; it is also a budget that is both active and reliable.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the state budget revenue for 1959 is 52.001 billion yuan, and the budget expenditure is 52.001 billion yuan, with a balanced revenue and expenditure. Compared with the final accounts of 1958, revenue increased by 24.2%; expenditure increased by 27%. The increase in budget revenue in 1959 fully considered the objective possibilities and was in line with the growth of the national economy in 1959. Although the increase in budget revenue is very large, it is based on facts and can be completed or even overfulfilled with effort. He said that according to the different economic components of the payment of budget revenue in 1959, the payment of state-owned enterprises accounted for 87.9% of the total budget revenue, the payment of rural people's communes accounted for 11.3% of the total budget revenue, and the payment of other aspects accounted for 0.8% of the total budget revenue. It can be seen that the burden of the rural people's communes is basically maintained at the level of the previous year, and the proportion of various burdens of the rural people's communes in the total value of agricultural output will decrease from 7% in 1958 to 5.2%.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the state budget expenditure in 1959 is: economic construction expenditure is 31.7 billion yuan, accounting for 61% of the total budget expenditure; social, cultural and educational expenditure is 5.73 billion yuan, accounting for 11% of the total budget expenditure; national defense expenditure is 5.8 billion yuan, accounting for 11.2% of the total budget expenditure; administrative management expenditure is 2.69 billion yuan, accounting for 5.2% of the total budget expenditure. He said that in the state budget expenditure in 1959, the proportion of economic construction expenditure and social, cultural and educational expenditure is 72%, which still maintains the level of 1958; the proportion of national defense expenditure and administrative expenditure has further decreased, from 17.8% in 1958 to 16.4% in 1959. The investment in capital construction has increased rapidly, increasing by 26% this year compared to 1958, accounting for 52% of the total state budget expenditure. In economic construction expenditure, the investment in the people's communes has increased by 1 billion yuan as the state's financial subsidy to the people's communes. This fund will mainly be allocated to the people's communes and production teams with poor economic conditions to help them develop production, so that they can catch up with the level of the relatively wealthy communes in a short period of time. Of course, the funds allocated by the state are limited, and the development of the economy of the people's communes mainly relies on its own accumulation. In the state budget expenditure in 1959, an additional 3.17 billion yuan of bank credit funds was allocated to ensure the needs of state-owned enterprises for working capital in a timely manner.

Save expenses as much as possible, so that every penny of funds can play a role in construction

In the last part of his report, Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that in order to successfully realize the state budget for 1959, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard"; it is necessary to strengthen economic accounting, improve labor productivity, and reduce costs. He especially emphasized that it is necessary to continue to carry out a larger-scale movement to increase production and practice economy. All economic departments, all enterprises and institutions, and all people's communes must use existing equipment as much as possible and save manpower, materials, and financial resources as much as possible; all administrative management departments must save expenses as much as possible, so that every penny of funds can play as much a role as possible in construction.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said at the end of his report that the current situation is very favorable for realizing the state budget for 1959. All the vibrant and prosperous scenes show that the people of all ethnic groups in our country, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, are bravely fighting for a new Great Leap Forward this year. We believe that the state budget of our country in 1959 will surely be successfully completed, and the socialist construction of our country in 1959 will surely achieve greater victories.

After Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report, Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, gave the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China" at the meeting.

Ma Mingfang, Chairman of the Credentials Committee of the Second National People's Congress, gave the "Report on the Examination of the Qualifications of Deputies by the Credentials Committee of the Second National People's Congress", and the meeting approved this report.

All members of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference attended today's meeting.

Foreign envoys to China and some foreign guests in Beijing were invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting ended at 5:10 PM. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

    把今年的宏伟图景变成辉煌的现实
    人大全体会议听取李富春副总理关于国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理
    关于国家决算和预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长关于人大常委会的工作报告
    新华社21日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议今天下午举行全体会议，听取了关于1959年国民经济计划草案的报告、关于1958年国家决算和1959年国家预算草案的报告、全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，审议并通过了关于代表资格的审查报告。
    今天大会的执行主席是：宋庆龄，班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞，刘伯承，林枫，张治中，陈嘉庚，周建人，许德珩，周文江，周叔弢，陈绍宽。
    国务院副总理兼计划委员会主任李富春所作的“关于1959年国民经济计划草案的报告”和国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念所作的“关于1958年国家决算和1959年国家预算草案的报告”，展示了我国1959年发展国民经济的宏伟图景，充分说明了1959年的国民经济计划是在去年大跃进的基础上继续大跃进的计划。他们号召全国人民动员起来，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，坚持党的建设社会主义的总路线，运用和发扬1958年大跃进的成功经验，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为实现1959年的继续大跃进而斗争。
    李富春副总理的报告是在下午三时开始的，他在报告中，首先对1959年我国国民经济计划的安排作了说明。他说，中共八届六中全会讨论了1959年发展国民经济的主要任务和方针，提出了钢、煤、粮、棉四项指标。这是编制1959年计划草案的主要依据。这个计划草案已先后经过中共八届七中全会和国务院全体会议讨论和通过。
    1959年工农业总产值比1958年增长40％
    李富春副总理说，计划草案规定，1959年我国工农业总产值为二千八百七十亿元，比1958年增长40％。即增加八百二十亿元。
    在工业生产方面，李富春副总理说，1959年的工业生产计划，首先注意了原料、材料工业和燃料、动力工业的发展。同一千八百万吨钢和三亿八千万吨煤的指标相适应，计划规定，今年的生铁产量将由1958年的一千三百六十九万吨增加到二千三百万吨，发电量由1958年的二百七十五亿度增加到四百亿度，水泥产量由1958年的九百三十万吨增加到一千二百五十万吨。其他如原油、木材、硫酸、烧碱、纯碱等产品的产量，也将有很大增长。这些产品在1959年增加的产量，都将比1958年所增加的产量为高。在机器制造工业方面，今年采矿设备、洗煤设备、炼焦设备、轧钢设备和发电设备的产量，都将成倍地增长。
    由于农业和重工业的大跃进，1959年有可能也有必要较快地发展轻工业。计划规定，今年棉纱、棉布、纸、食用植物油、糖、原盐等产品的产量，将比去年增长25％到67％。
    李富春副总理说，1959年的工业生产计划，贯彻了重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针，贯彻了优先发展重工业、首先是发展原料材料工业和以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针。1959年生产资料工业的产值比1958年增长46％，生活资料工业的产值增长34％。
    李富春副总理说，1959年发展农业的任务，是用最大的努力，争取粮食产量跃进到一万零五百亿斤，棉花产量跃进到一亿担，提前实现全国农业发展纲要规定的关于粮棉增产的指标，并且使各类经济作物和林业、畜牧业、副业、渔业都得到普遍的发展。在大力增产粮食和棉花的基础上，应当实行农业的多种经营，发展人民公社的商品生产。
    粮食、棉花和其他农作物增产的主要途径，是提高单位面积产量。同时，必须保持一定的播种面积，并且有计划地扩大国营农牧场的耕地。1959年全国的播种面积计划为二十一亿亩，其中粮食的播种面积为十六亿亩，棉花的播种面积为一亿亩。计划还规定扩大灌溉面积一亿亩。
    1959年基本建设投资比1958年增长26％
    关于基本建设，李富春副总理说，1959年国家对基本建设的投资总额计划为二百七十亿元，比1958年增长26％。1959年的投资较多地集中在工业和运输部门。全部投资分配给地方的为42.7％，比往年有了显著的提高。
    李富春副总理说，运输业、商业和文化教育事业，今年也将有很大的发展。1959年的社会商品零售总额计划为六百五十亿元，比1958年增长19％。通过商业机构供应给人民的粮食、肉类、食用植物油、水产品、盐、棉布、针织品和其他日用品，都将比1958年有所增长。
    李富春副总理指出，1959年国民经济计划是一个继续大跃进的计划。实现这样一个继续大跃进的计划是必要的，经过全国人民的努力奋斗，也是可能的。他在报告中列举了许多实现今年继续大跃进的有利条件。他说，1958年工业生产的大跃进，为1959年的继续跃进提供了有利的物质技术条件；由于农村中实现了人民公社化，农业生产力得到了进一步解放；在1958年的大跃进中，各个战线都积累了大量的技术经验和组织经验。今年，我们还将继续得到苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的大力援助。
    李富春副总理强调指出，实现1959年计划的最重要的有利条件是，广大干部和群众提高了政治觉悟，加强了政治团结，掌握了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针。
    立即在国民经济各个战线展开一个全民的增产节约运动
    李富春副总理接着说，为了保证1959年计划的完成和争取超额完成，在当前必须采取的各项组织措施中，最重要的一个环节，就是立即在国民经济各个战线上，开展一个全民的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。
    李富春副总理接着分别讲述了国民经济各个战线开展增产节约运动的具体任务。他强调说，无论在那个战线上，开展增产节约运动的要求都必须是多快好省的统一，都必须是数量、质量和安全的统一，决不要片面地强调一个侧面而忽视另一个侧面。在增产节约运动中，要经常地认真地注意提高产品和工程的质量，保证生产、建设和运输的安全。
    李富春副总理说，要把全民的增产节约运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来，必须进一步放手发动群众。群众运动和集中领导相结合，是党和国家一贯的方针。群众运动的大规模开展，要求我们加强集中领导，以便把中央、地方和企业的力量更好地结合起来，同心协力，扭成一股劲，完成国家计划规定的各项任务，并且按照轻重缓急进行“排队”，首先保证完成主要的任务。
    李富春副总理在结束他的报告时说，1959年发展国民经济的计划是一个宏伟的、艰巨的、但是可以完成的计划。让我们动员起来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，坚持党的建设社会主义的总路线，运用和发扬1958年大跃进的成功经验，鼓足干劲、力争上游，为实现1959年的继续跃进而斗争。我们一定要完成这个计划，我们一定能够完成这个计划。
    会议休息二十分钟后，李先念副总理接着作报告。李先念副总理说，1958年国家财政预算执行的结果，收入和支出，都大大超过了原来的设想；收支规模和增长速度，都远远超过了以往任何一年。这是我国人民奋战一年的胜利。
    1958年财政收入和支出比1957年都增加35％，收支相抵结余九亿元
    李先念副总理报告了1958年国家财政收支决算的结果是：收入四百一十八亿六千万元，相当于原预算数三百三十二亿元的126.1％，比1957年增长35％，而第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长速度只有12％，增长最快的1953年和1956年也只有23％和16％。1958年支出四百零九亿六千万元，相当于原预算三百三十二亿元的123.4％，比1957年增长35％。支出超过预算的部分，主要是用来扩大了基本建设的规模。这一年用于基本建设的投资总计为二百一十四亿元，比上年增长70％。1958年国家财政收支相抵，结余九亿元，这是属于地方预算的结余，将要由地方结转到1959年继续使用。
    国营企业收入大增农民负担相对减少
    李先念副总理在报告中指出：1958年生产跃进、经济高涨的根本保证是党的领导，政治挂帅，是群众路线的大发展。同时，也是同苏联和各兄弟国家的大力援助分不开的。他说，1958年国家财政所以取得巨大的成就，归根到底，是来自工农业生产的高速度发展。
    李先念副总理着重指出，1958年财政收入增长得这样快，绝不是由于加重了人民的负担。1958年国家财政收入当中，来自国营企业事业所缴纳的税收和利润共占83.9％，而来自农村人民公社的缴款只占13.7％，来自其他方面的缴款占2.4％。农民负担占农业总产值的比例，1957年是10％，1958年下降为7％。这就是说，农民的负担是相对地减少了，而不是增加了。
    他同时指出，1958年我国市场物价也是稳定的。从市场供应来看，1958年秋季以来，城市中一部分副食品和某些日用工业品出现供不应求、略有紧张的情况，这主要是因为城市就业面扩大，职工人数增加，需要量增大。同时由于人民公社举办公共食堂和其他公共福利事业，农民的生活改善了，农村副食品消费量增大了，因而供应城市的部分相对地减少了；由于农民收入的增加，农村对日用工业品的需要也增加了。因此尽管1958年工农业产品是增加的，市场商品供应数量是扩大的，仍然赶不上各方面需要的增长。他说，在我们这样一个人口众多、需要量很大的国家中，在国民经济大踏步跃进和人民公社化这样巨大的社会变革当中，经济生活中发生某些暂时的困难是难以完全避免的。但是，尽管发生了某些供不应求的情况，我们仍然维持了市场物价的稳定。
    李先念副总理强调说，在发展生产的基础上，保证财政收支平衡，这是我们国家财政经济工作中历来遵循的一条重要原则。我们国家所以能够始终保持币值稳定和市场物价的稳定，原因就在这里。
    1959年财政收入增长24.2％支出增长27％，收支平衡
    李先念副总理在报告1959年国家预算的安排问题时说：适应今年国民经济的继续大跃进，现在编成的1959年国家预算草案，是一个挖掘潜力，支持全面跃进的预算；是一个贯彻“全国一盘棋”精神，在集中领导的原则下调动各方面积极因素的预算；也是一个既积极而又可靠的预算。
    李先念副总理说，1959年国家预算收入五百二十亿零一千万元，预算支出五百二十亿零一千万元，收支平衡。同1958年决算数比较，收入增长24.2％；支出增长27％。1959年预算收入的增长，是充分考虑了客观可能性并且和1959年国民经济的增长相适应的。预算收入的增长幅度虽然很大，但这是有根据的，经过努力是能够完成甚至超额完成的。他说，1959年预算收入按不同经济成分的缴款来划分，国营企业的缴款，占预算收入总数的87.9％，农村人民公社的缴款占预算收入总数的11.3％，其他方面的缴款占预算收入总数的0.8％。可以看出，农村人民公社的负担是基本上保持上年水平的，农村人民公社各项负担在农业总产值中所占的比例，将由1958年的7％下降为5.2％。
    李先念副总理说，1959年国家预算支出的情况是：经济建设费三百一十七亿元，占预算支出总数的61％；社会文教费五十七亿三千万元，占预算支出总数的11％；国防费五十八亿元，占预算支出总数的11.2％；行政管理费二十六亿九千万元，占预算支出总数的5.2％。他说，1959年国家预算支出中，经济建设费和社会文教费所占的比例为72％，仍然保持1958年的水平；国防费和行政费所占的比例却进一步有所降低，1958年为17.8％，1959年将下降为16.4％。基本建设的投资增加很快，今年比1958年增长26％，占国家预算支出总数的52％。在经济建设支出中，增加了对人民公社的投资十亿元，作为国家对人民公社的财政补助，这笔资金主要地将分配给经济条件较差的人民公社和生产队，帮助他们发展生产，使他们能在不长的时间内，赶上比较富裕的公社的水平，当然，国家拨给的资金是有限度的，人民公社发展经济主要还是依靠本身的积累。1959年国家预算支出中，还增拨银行信贷资金三十一亿七千万元，以便及时保证国营企业对流动资金的需要。
    尽量节约开支，使每一文资金在建设中都能发挥作用
    李先念副总理在报告的最后一部分中说，为了圆满地实现1959年的国家预算，必须坚决贯彻实行“全国一盘棋”的原则；必须加强经济核算，提高劳动生产率，降低成本。他特别强调要继续开展更大规模的增产节约运动，一切经济部门，一切企业事业单位，一切人民公社，都必须尽可能地利用现有设备，尽可能地节约人力物力和财力；一切行政管理部门必须尽可能地节约开支，使每一文资金在建设中都能发挥尽可能大的作用。
    李先念副总理在报告结束时说，目前的形势对实现1959年国家预算是十分有利的。一切生气勃勃，欣欣向荣的景象都显示：我国各族人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，正在为今年新的大跃进而英勇奋斗。我们相信，1959年我国国家预算一定能够圆满完成，1959年我国社会主义建设一定能够取得更大的胜利。
