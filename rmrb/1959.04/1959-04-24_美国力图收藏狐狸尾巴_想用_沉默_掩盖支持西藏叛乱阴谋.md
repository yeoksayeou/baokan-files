    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: An Associated Press report from Washington on the 22nd stated that American officials are adopting a so-called "strategic silence policy" regarding the Tibetan rebellion in order to avoid exposing the United States too much.

    The news agency said that many officials in Washington believe that "if the United States joins the debate and engages in various propaganda efforts, it will only mess things up." It stated that the Chinese side has already accused "the United States of supporting the Tibetan rebellion."

    The news agency insidiously stated that China's action in quelling the Tibetan rebellion "has opened the eyes of Asians, thereby seeing the truth of communism." It said: "American officials believe that if the United States is too involved in this situation, it will reduce this impact."

    At the same time, the news agency unreservedly said, "(American) officials are closely watching the development of the situation. They are pleased to note the Dalai Lama's statement on Wednesday." "It is expected that the Tibetan leader's approach to his future will have a significant impact on American policy."

    The news agency revealed that the United States is still prepared to take further interventionist actions in the Tibetan situation. It said, "Due to the same reason as in Hungary—the reason being that it might cause war—and the impossibility of intervention by external forces, it is still possible to take other less powerful actions in the future. If the Dalai Lama decides to establish a government-in-exile, then the question arises as to whether to recognize his regime. If an Asian country requests the United Nations to pass a resolution condemning Communist China, the United States would vote in favor of such a resolution."

    Before this, it was known that some figures in the American ruling clique have been clamoring to "welcome" Tibetan rebels to the United States to organize a "government-in-exile," and instigating a certain Asian country to bring the so-called "Tibetan issue" to the United Nations.

    美国力图收藏狐狸尾巴
    想用“沉默”掩盖支持西藏叛乱阴谋
    新华社23日讯　美联社22日从华盛顿发出的一篇报道说，美国官员们正在对西藏叛乱事件采取一种所谓“带战略性的沉默政策”，目的是避免过于暴露美国。
    这家通讯社说，华盛顿的许多官员认为，“美国如果参加争论并且进行各种宣传，那只会把情况搞乱。”它说，中国方面已经指责“美国是支持西藏叛乱的”。
    这家通讯社别有用心地说，中国平定西藏叛乱的行动“打开了亚洲人的眼睛，从而看清了共产主义的真相。”它说：“美国官员们认为，如果美国在这个局势中牵连太多，将会减低这种影响”。
    同时，这家通讯社毫不隐讳地说，“（美国）官员们正在密切地注视着局势的发展。他们满意地注意到达赖喇嘛星期三发表的声明”。“可以预料，这位西藏领袖对于他的前途采取什么方针会对美国政策发生重大影响。”
    这家通讯社透露，美国仍然准备对西藏局势采取进一步的干涉行动。它说，“由于像在匈牙利的同样的理由——这个理由是，那样可能会引起战争——而不可能由外界力量进行干涉，将来采取别种力量不那么大的行动仍然是可能的。如果达赖喇嘛决定建立流亡政府，那就产生是否承认他的政权的问题。如果某个亚洲国家要求联合国通过决议谴责共产党中国的话，美国会投票赞成这项决议。”
    在这之前，大家知道，美国统治集团的一些人物一直在叫嚷“欢迎”西藏的叛乱分子到美国去组织“流亡政府”，并且挑唆某个亚洲国家把所谓“西藏问题”提到联合国去。
