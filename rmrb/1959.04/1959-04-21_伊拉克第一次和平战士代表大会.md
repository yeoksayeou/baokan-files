    The First Congress of Peace Partisans of Iraq
    Question: Iraq convened its Second Congress of Peace Partisans. When was the first congress held?
    Beijing, Hong Bin
    The First Congress of Peace Partisans of Iraq was held secretly on the evening of July 15, 1954. At that time, Iraq was on the eve of being dragged into the Baghdad Pact by American and British imperialism. After the failure of the plan of the US and Britain to organize the "Middle East Command" in the Middle East, they instigated Turkey and Pakistan to sign a military agreement in 1954, which became the basis of the Baghdad Pact. Then, the United States and Pakistan signed a military agreement, and Iraq also signed a "military aid" agreement with the United States in April of the same year. The then Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamali was visiting the United States, stepping up activities to drag Iraq into the Turkish-Pakistani military agreement. The Iraqi Peace Partisans organization launched a struggle against the plan of American and British imperialism to piece together the Baghdad Pact, and in the parliamentary election of June 1954, it put forward a campaign platform to defend peace and independence, oppose the Turkish-Pakistani alliance and American military "aid," and demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq.
    The First Congress of Peace Partisans passed resolutions demanding the strengthening of the struggle to ease international tensions, to stop the Indochina War and resolve the Korean issue, to hold negotiations on the German question, to restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, to abolish atomic weapons, and to abolish military treaties. The resolution also called for strengthening the unity of the national ranks, for struggling to liberate Iraq from imperialist bondage, and for supporting the Arab people and neighboring countries in their struggle for independence and freedom.

    伊拉克第一次和平战士代表大会
    问：伊拉克召开了第二次和平战士代表大会，请问第一次和平战士代表大会是在什么时候召开的？
    北京　洪宾
    伊拉克和平战士代表大会是在1954年7月15日的晚上秘密举行的。当时伊拉克正处在被美英帝国主义拖进巴格达条约的前夕。美英企图在中东地区组织“中东司令部”的计划破产后，于1954年唆使土耳其和巴基斯坦签订军事协定，成为巴格达条约的基础，然后是美国和巴基斯坦签订了军事协定，伊拉克也在同年4月同美国签订了“军事援助”协定。当时的伊拉克外交大臣贾马利正在访问美国，为把伊拉克拖入土耳其—巴基斯坦军事协定而加紧活动。伊拉克和平战士组织展开了反对美英帝国主义拼凑巴格达条约计划的斗争，并曾在1954年6月议会选举中提出了保卫和平与独立的竞选纲领，反对土巴联盟和美国军事“援助”，要求外国军队撤出伊拉克。
    第一次和平战士代表大会曾经通过决议，要求加强缓和国际紧张局势的斗争，停止印度支那战争和解决朝鲜问题，就德国问题举行谈判，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位，废除原子武器，废除军事条约。决议还号召加强民族队伍的团结，为使伊拉克从帝国主义束缚下解放出来而斗争，并且声援阿拉伯人民和邻近国家争取独立和自由。
