Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: Reports from Western news agencies indicate that American authorities are plotting to exploit the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion by Tibetan reactionaries. They are mobilizing reactionaries and all propaganda machines to intensify the incitement of an anti-China movement, and are attempting to provoke and alienate China's neighbors from China.
　　Former US Ambassador to India and Republican Senator Cooper has also been mobilized to publish fallacies hostile to China. He clamored that the Tibetan rebellion should be brought to the United Nations for discussion under the terms of "genocide" and advocated that it be done by an Asian country that did not participate in the Western alliance, conspiring to turn the United Nations into a tool for interfering in China's internal affairs.
　　Cooper nonsensically claimed that the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion was "intolerable to coexist with their own domestic existence." He smugly made a big fuss about this, maliciously provoking China's neighbors to harm their relations with China, saying, "Now who can believe that their policies will allow coexistence to be practiced outside their country?"
　　People have seen clearly that the former U.S. ambassador to India is serving his country in this way by implementing the US's anti-China policy and Cold War policy.
　　The United States Information Service, as a tool for implementing the US's "Cold War" policy, certainly does not relax its use of the Tibetan rebels' armed rebellion to incite anti-Chinese sentiment. In a telegram issued on the 9th, it wantonly slandered the Chinese government's crusade against the rebellion as "another example of complete disregard for the political and religious rights of other nations." Although this news agency could not but admit that Tibet had always been "within the scope of the Chinese nation" in history, it nonsensically claimed that the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion was to turn Tibet into "a complete colony."
　　The American ruling group also mobilized other reactionary organizations to incite anti-Chinese sentiment. A so-called "China-America Friendship Association" in New York passed an "emergency resolution" on the 10th, demanding that the United Nations immediately investigate the so-called Chinese "aggression in Asia" and demanding that the U.S. government send "relief supplies" to the Tibetan rebels.
　　Despite the U.S. government's mobilization of all propaganda machines to promote an anti-China movement, even reactionary figures like Cooper and Bowles doubt the effectiveness of the U.S. in inciting anti-China sentiment by exploiting the Tibetan rebellion. They believe that doing so "may do more harm than good." Former U.S. Ambassador to India Bowles said, "The worst thing our 'Voice of America' and other propaganda agencies can do is to call these people (referring to the Tibetan rebels) our allies."

　　妄图借西藏叛乱事件煽起敌视我国的运动
　　美国“冷战”策士恶毒叫嚣
    新华社11日讯　西方通讯社的报道表明，美国当局阴谋利用中国政府平息西藏反动分子武装叛乱事件，动员反动派和所有宣传机器加紧煽动一个敌视中国的运动，并且妄图挑拨和离间中国的邻国同中国的关系。
    美国前驻印度大使、共和党参议员库柏也被动员出来发表敌视中国的谬论。他叫嚣应该根据“种族消灭”的条款，把西藏叛乱事件拿到联合国去讨论，并且鼓吹由一个没有参加西方联盟的亚洲国家来做，阴谋把联合国变成干涉中国内政的工具。
    库柏胡说什么中国政府镇压叛乱是“不能容许他们自己的国内存在共处”，他自鸣得意地以此大做文章，恶意地挑拨中国的邻国同中国的关系，说什么“现在谁能够相信他们的政策将容许在他们国家以外的地方实行共处呢？”
    人们都看清楚前美国驻印度大使就是这样执行美国的敌视中国的政策和冷战政策为他们的祖国效劳的。
    美国新闻处作为执行美国“冷战”政策的工具，当然也不放松它利用西藏叛乱分子进行武装叛乱的事件煽起敌视中国的情绪。它在9日发出的一条电讯中，信口雌黄地诬蔑中国政府讨伐叛乱是“完全无视其他民族的政治和宗教权利的又一事例”。这家通讯社虽然不能不承认在历史上西藏是一直在“中国国家范畴内”，但是却又胡说什么中国政府镇压叛乱就是要把西藏变成“彻底的殖民地”。
    美国统治集团还动员其他反动组织来煽动敌视中国的情绪。在纽约的一个所谓“中美联谊会”在10日通过了一项“紧急决议”，要求联合国立即研究所谓中国“在亚洲的侵略”，并且要求美国政府发“救济品”给西藏的叛乱分子。
    尽管美国政府动员所有的宣传机器推行敌视中国的运动，但是就连库柏、鲍尔斯这类反动家伙也怀疑美国利用西藏叛乱事件煽动敌视中国的运动的效果。他们认为，这样做“可能害多利少”。前美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯说，“我们的‘美国之音’和其他宣传机构所能做的最糟糕的事情将是把这些人（指西藏叛乱分子）称作是我们的盟友。”
