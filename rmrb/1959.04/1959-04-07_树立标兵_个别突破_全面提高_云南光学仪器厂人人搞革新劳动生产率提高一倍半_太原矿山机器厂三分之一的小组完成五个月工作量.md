(Our newspaper's dispatch from Kunming on the 6th) "One person breaks through, everyone breaks through; one doubles, everyone doubles." The Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory, through the "Pace-Setter Competition" centered on high output and high quality, has already increased the labor productivity of the entire factory by one and a half times, overfulfilled the first quarter plan, realized 290,000 technical innovation proposals, and formed a lively scene of "thinking about innovation in everything, talking about innovation with everyone, and engaging in innovation by everyone; innovation and more innovation." The remarkable characteristic of this competition is the continuous raising of the level of all producers to that of advanced producers, so that the production of entire groups, sections, and workshops constantly leap forward in batches.

The pace-setter competition at the Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory started like this: Polishing worker Yang Zhongyin created the "rapid polishing method," reducing polishing time from 90 minutes to 8 minutes. The factory immediately designated Yang Zhongyin as a pace-setter and organized workers to "learn from pace-setters, catch up with pace-setters, and surpass pace-setters." His method was quickly promoted among all polishing workers in the entire workshop, and the average polishing efficiency of the entire workshop increased by one to two times. The promotion of the polishing process also promoted the innovation of other processes. The downstream coating process was not originally a backward process, but due to the breakthrough in polishing, it became a new weak link. Coating workers improved the fixtures and operating methods, also increasing efficiency by one to three times. Subsequently, the edging process also made corresponding leaps forward.

The pace-setter competition then became active throughout the factory. After veteran worker You Xianguang of Workshop Six created the "multi-piece head and fly cutter milling" method, efficiency increased by more than 200 times, solving the problem of parallel difference accuracy of cubic parts that technicians could not solve even after searching through all the materials. After he was listed as a pace-setter, he enthusiastically and proactively helped 150 milling workers promote his experience in the same process and used his spare time to manufacture 96 sets of fixtures for everyone. Cao Songnian of Workshop Five mastered the operating rules of the large hexagonal lathe and created a new method of "multi-tool, multi-blade, combined tooling, multi-piece processing," which increased efficiency by one to six times. The workshop immediately organized 160 lathe operators to learn from pace-setter Cao Songnian's method. In the process of learning and catching up, eight pace-setters with their own characteristics, such as Zhao Yansheng and Li Mingliang, emerged. Cao Songnian absorbed their creations and further combined 16 processes into four, so that every process achieved significant innovation. Now, more than 60% of the lathe operators have mastered his method, and the efficiency of hexagonal lathes in the entire workshop has increased by one to two times.

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Taiyuan on the 6th) The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory has launched a movement to plant red flags and establish "pace-setters." This movement has powerfully stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers and deepened the technical revolution movement.

The equipment at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory is simple, and this year's tasks are doubled compared to last year. At the beginning of this year, the factory's Party committee launched a "skillful work" and "doubling output" movement among the workers, which promoted the technical revolution movement forward. However, because the leadership was still making general appeals, the masses were not widely mobilized, and the momentum of the movement was not great. In response to this situation, the Party committee decided to plant red flags and seize typical examples to establish pace-setters for the masses, and deeply mobilize the masses. In the summary work, it was found that the work of Communist Party members Su Tianhe and Han Shulin and probationary Party member Feng Youjian was very outstanding. In previous years, some of them completed two years' worth of work in one year, and some completed nine years' worth of work in five years. This year, they have achieved remarkable results again. Feng Youjian has realized 103 technical innovations in the first quarter of this year, increasing efficiency by 46 times and completing 11 months' worth of work. Han Shulin painstakingly researched a set of fast operating methods, completing six months' worth of work in the first quarter. Su Tianhe completed seven months' worth of work in the first quarter.

The Party committee of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory established these three advanced producers as pace-setters for the factory-wide competition, announced their deeds of hard work and continuous innovation to the workers of the entire factory, and called on everyone to learn from them. After discussion and debate, the workers realized that the potential for technical innovation was great, and there would be ways as long as they used their brains. On March 5, Feng Youjian and the other two issued a challenge letter to the workers of the entire factory and launched a competition. The workers rose up to respond to the challenge. On the same day, Zhu Zhen, a heat treatment worker in the tool workshop, improved the quenching tools, increasing efficiency by 50 times, and won first place in the factory-wide competition. The riveting and welding group of the forging and riveting workshop immediately challenged Zhu Zhen, improved the punching machine and mold frame, increasing efficiency by 60 times, surpassing Zhu Zhen. Then, the competition expanded from individuals to teams and from workshops to workshops.

In order to facilitate the promotion of the collectivist spirit of the broad masses, in addition to establishing individual and workshop "pace-setters," and carpenter, riveter, and welder "pace-setters," the factory focused on establishing "pace-setters" in the center of mass production activities—the work group—to further promote the deepening of the movement. Since the movement was launched a month ago, 40% of the workers in the entire factory have achieved double quotas (one person doing the work of two), realized more than 16,000 technical innovations, 32 groups (one-third of the entire factory) have completed more than five months of work, and the entire factory has overfulfilled the first quarter plan.

### 树立标兵　个别突破　全面提高  云南光学仪器厂人人搞革新劳动生产率提高一倍半  太原矿山机器厂三分之一的小组完成五个月工作量

    树立标兵　个别突破　全面提高
    云南光学仪器厂人人搞革新劳动生产率提高一倍半
    太原矿山机器厂三分之一的小组完成五个月工作量
    本报昆明6日电　“一人突破，大家突破，一个翻番，全体翻番”。云南光学仪器厂通过高产优质为中心的“标兵赛”，已使全厂的劳动生产率提高了一倍半，超额完成了第一季度计划，技术革新建议实现了二十九万件，形成了“事事想革新，人人谈革新，个个搞革新；革新再革新”的生动场面。这个竞赛的显著特点是不断把全体生产者的水平提高到先进生产者水平上来，整个小组、工段、车间的生产成批地不断跃进。
    云南光学仪器厂的标兵竞赛是这样开始的：抛光工人杨钟璌创造了“快速抛光法”，抛光时间由九十分钟减少到八分钟，这个厂立即把杨钟璌列为标兵，组织工人“学标兵、赶标兵、超标兵”。他的方法就很快在全车间抛光工人中推广，整个车间抛光效率平均提高一至两倍。由于抛光工序的带动，也促使了其它工序的革新。下道涂膜工序本来不是落后工序，但由于抛光的突进而成为新的薄弱环节。涂膜工人改进了夹具和操作方法，也使效率提高一至三倍。随之磨边工序也有了相应跃进。
    标兵赛随后在全厂活跃起来。六车间老工人游现光创造“多作装头和飞刀铣切”方法后，效率提高两百倍以上，解决了技术人员翻遍资料也无法解决的立方体零件平行差精度问题。他被列为标兵后，热情主动地帮助一百五十个铣工在同道工序上推广了他的经验，并利用业余时间为大家制造了九十六副夹具。五车工曹松年掌握了大六角车床的操作规律，创造了“多刀多刃，组合工具，多件加工”的新方法，使工效提高了一至六倍。车间立即组织一百六十个车工学习标兵曹松年的方法，在学习和追赶中又出现了各有特色的赵炎生、李明亮等八个标兵。曹松年又吸取他们的创造后，进一步将十六道工序并为四道，使道道工序都做到有很大的革新。现在已有60％以上车工掌握了他的方法，并使全车间六角车床效率提高一至两倍。
    本报太原6日电　太原矿山机器厂开展了插红旗、树“标兵”运动。这一运动有力地激发了职工的积极性，使技术革命运动深入开展。
    太原矿山机器厂的设备简陋，今年任务比去年增加一倍。今年年初，厂党委曾发动工人开展了“巧干”、“翻番”运动，推动技术革命运动前进了一步。但是，由于领导还是一般号召，因此，群众发动得不广泛，运动的声势不大，针对这个情况，党委决定插红旗抓典型为群众树立标兵，深入的发动群众。在总结工作中，发现了共产党员宿天和、韩树林和预备党员冯有健的工作很出色。前几年里，他们有的一年做完两年工作量，有的五年做完九年工作量。今年，他们又获得了显著的成绩。冯有健今年第一季度已实现了技术革新一百零三项，提高效率四十六倍，完成了十一个月的工作量。韩树林苦心研究出一套快速操作办法，第一季度完成六个月的工作量。宿天和第一季度完成了七个月的工作量。
    太原矿山机器厂党委把这三位先进生产者立为全厂竞赛的标兵，向全厂工人公布了他们刻苦钻研不断革新的事迹，号召大家向他们学习。工人们经过讨论和辩论，认识到技术革新的潜力很大，只要动脑筋就有办法。3月5日，冯有健等三人向全厂职工下了挑战书，发起竞赛。工人们纷纷起来应战。当天，工具车间热处理工朱镇改进了沾火工具，效率提高五十倍，获得全厂竞赛第一。锻铆车间铆焊工吴志旺小组立即向朱镇挑战，改进了冲孔机和模架板，提高效率六十倍，超过了朱镇。接着，竞赛就由个人扩展到班组之间和车间与车间之间。
    为了便于发扬广大群众的集体主义精神，这个厂除了树立个人和车间“标兵”、和木工、铆工、焊工“标兵”外，着重地在群众生产活动的中心——小组树立“标兵”，进一步推动了运动的深入开展。运动开展一个月以来，全厂有40％的工人实现了双定额（一人顶二人），实现了技术革新一万六千多件，有三十二个小组（占全厂三分之一）完成了五个月以上的工作量，全厂超额完成了第一季度计划。
