Joyfully Viewing the Zhanjiang Print Exhibition
Mark

The first Zhanjiang District Print Exhibition, currently on display in Beijing, is the culmination of mass art creation activities in twelve counties of the Zhanjiang region of Guangdong, and a new achievement in the development of Chinese print art. Facing these substantial, vivid, and almost entirely amateur-created print works, one cannot help but feel excited.

Most of the more than 250 prints in this fascinating exhibition from the South China Sea were created in 1958 in conjunction with various political propaganda efforts and specific local production struggles. The artists themselves are ordinary working people from various fronts, so they generally possess abundant emotion. Moreover, the subject matter is broad, the forms and styles are diverse, and they have distinct local characteristics. Whether depicting the labor life of fishermen, or the struggle activities of militiamen such as training and shooting; whether depicting the atmosphere of abundant harvests of rice, sugarcane, and salt fields, or the scenes of mass steelmaking, reservoir construction, and canal opening, they all exude a thriving upward spirit, permeating people's enthusiasm and praise for life and labor. What is particularly gratifying is the growth of woodcut creation among workers and peasants.

In the exhibition, the prints by workers and peasants are not only greater in number, but also improved in quality. For example, Deng Xiaojun's "Deep Plowing," Deng Junlun's "Duck Flock," Zhang Wenzi's "Fieldside Culture Pavilion," and Zheng Fu's "Blocking the Sea," have all better mastered the characteristics of printmaking in terms of subject matter, composition, and black and white tone processing. The pictures are simple, and unpretentious, without any affectation. For example, in the monochrome woodcut "Deep Plowing," the author depicts the new appearance of peasants in labor with prominent images and bright tones. The foreground of the picture is three women plowing the fields with cattle, and the background is a group of farmers who are working hard to mine and smelt iron. One picture shows two things, with clear primary and secondary elements, which not only does not feel scattered, but strengthens the sense of the times in the work. The characters in the picture are lifelike in their expressions and movements, which can make people feel their positive and conscious attitude towards labor. In addition, there are many excellent works in the exhibition, which cannot be discussed one by one in this short article. However, a shortcoming is that the color separation of some works is relatively stiff, the colors are uncoordinated, and they are not good at using simple color separation to express rich color effects. For example, Cui Guanzhang's "Seaside Market" is a masterpiece with the scenery of the South China Sea, but unfortunately, the charm of the work is weakened due to improper color separation.

In general, this is a successful exhibition. Its significance is not only to add many good works to China's print art, but more importantly, it once again proves that this art form can be mastered by the masses. The seeds of print art have grown rapidly in the soil of the masses. The print creation in Zhanjiang District started with a small number of teachers and cadres and gradually expanded to workers and peasants. Among the more than 100 amateur authors participating in this exhibition, a quarter are workers and peasants. From the first harvest of print creation in Zhanjiang District, we can foresee a more prosperous print creation in China.

### 喜看湛江版画展

　　喜看湛江版画展
　　马克
    正在北京展出的湛江区第一届版画展览会，是广东湛江地区十二个县群众美术创作活动的结晶，也是我国版画艺术发展中的一个新收获。面对着这些内容充实、生活气息浓厚，而且几乎全部是出自业余作者之手的版画作品，真使人抑制不住内心的兴奋。
    这个来自南海边的引人兴味的展览会展出的二百五十余幅版画中，大都是1958年结合每次政治宣传和当地各种具体的生产斗争而创作的，作者本身又是各个战线上的普通劳动群众，所以一般都具有充沛的感情。而且题材广泛，形式风格多样，并有鲜明的地方特色。在画中描绘的不论是渔民的劳动生活，或是练兵、射击等民兵的斗争活动；也不论是水稻、甘蔗、盐田等丰收的气象，或是群众大炼钢铁、修水库开运河等生产建设的情景，都洋溢着一片欣欣向上的情绪，渗透着人们对生活对劳动的热情和赞美。特别令人可喜的是工农群众木刻创作的成长。
    展览中，工农的版画不仅数量较多，而且质量也有提高。像邓晓俊的“深耕”、邓均伦的“鸭群”、张文子的“田间文化亭”和郑富的“堵海”等，在取材、构图和黑白调子处理方面，都较好地掌握了版画的特点。画面单纯、朴实，毫无矫柔造作之感。例如“深耕”这幅单色木刻，作者以突出的形象和明快的调子，描绘了农民在劳动中的新面貌。画的前景是三个正在用牛耕地的妇女，后景是一群正在紧张采矿炼铁的农民。一幅画表现两件事，主次分明，非但不感到分散，反而更加强了作品的时代感。画中的人物神情动态逼真，能使人感到他们对劳动积极自觉的态度。此外，展览中还有许多出色的作品，在这篇短文中不能一一谈及了。不过感到美中不足的是有一些作品的套色比较生硬，色彩不协调，不善于运用简单的套色表现出丰富的色彩效果。例如崔冠璋的“海滨市场”本是一幅具有南海风光的佳作，可惜由于套色不当而削弱了作品感人的魅力。
    总的说来，这是一次成功的展出。它的意义不仅只是给我国的版画艺术增添了许多好作品，而更重要的是再次证明了版画这种艺术形式能为广大群众所掌握。版画艺术的种子，在群众的土壤上已得到了迅速的成长。湛江区的版画创作，就是由少数的教师、干部开始而逐渐扩展到工人农民中去的。这次参加展出的一百多位业余作者中，就有四分之一是工人农民。从湛江区版画创作的第一次丰收，我们能预见我国版画创作更加繁荣。
