Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 7th: Yu Jikai, an acupuncturist at the Nandimen Clinic of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company, has discovered a new acupoint called "Dongfeng Point" based on the principles of meridian selection in traditional Chinese medicine and the anatomical understanding of Western medicine. Acupuncture at this point has shown good results in treating acute tonsillitis.

The "Dongfeng Point" discovered by Yu Jikai is located five fen (a traditional Chinese unit of measurement) in front and below the Tianrong Point, on the lower edge of the mandibular angle, in front of the cervical artery. From April of last year to the present, the clinic has used acupuncture at the "Dongfeng Point" to treat a total of one hundred and eighteen cases of acute tonsillitis. With the exception of one case that was ineffective due to complications from pneumonia, all the other cases were cured.
