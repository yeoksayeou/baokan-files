　　Resolutely Quell the Rebellion Thoroughly, and Firmly Take the Road of Democracy and Socialism!
　　The Tibetan People Are Forever Loyal to the Motherland Lhasa Holds Unprecedented Demonstration of 20,000 People
　　In Front of the Potala Palace, People Denounce the Heinous Crimes of the Rebel Bandits
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 15th - More than 20,000 Lhasa citizens solemnly held a demonstration today, resolutely demanding the thorough suppression of the rebellion. The masses participating in the demonstration accounted for two-thirds of the entire population of Lhasa, which is an unprecedentedly large demonstration in Tibetan history. This demonstration fully demonstrates the Tibetan people's sincere desire to be forever loyal to the motherland, love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and firmly take the road of democracy and socialism, as well as their high fighting will to resolutely oppose the rebellion.
    The people participating in the demonstration – thousands upon thousands of Tibetan residents and lamas – marched in teams through the streets and alleys, raising their arms and shouting slogans in Tibetan: "Celebrate the victory of suppressing the rebellion in the Lhasa area!" "Resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    This morning, when the Lhasa River Valley was still shrouded in the morning mist, Lhasa citizens gathered in groups towards the city center. National flags were universally hung throughout the city, and many women put on colorful clothes. They waved small flags, beat musical instruments, and excitedly participated in the parade, carrying huge cartoons and placards. At 10:00 AM, a large number of marching teams gathered on Barkhor Street in the city center. There were people of Tibetan, Hui, and Han ethnic groups, thousands of lamas, patriotic upper and middle class people, merchants, militiamen, women with children, and some elderly people in their seventies and eighties. It took more than two hours for the procession to pass through there. Many huge banners erected on Barkhor Street read: "People of all ethnic groups and all circles in Tibet unite and resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion!" The surging crowds and countless flags and banners made this ancient plateau city with a history of more than a thousand years appear exceptionally majestic and magnificent.
    The parade marched forward mightily. It was originally estimated that 10,000 people would participate in this demonstration, but today the number of people who took to the streets exceeded 20,000. Some orphans whose parents were taken away by the rebels, poor citizens and disabled people who were always despised under the rule of the former Tibetan local government, also participated in the demonstration. Among the teams of Tibetan and Han workers, many had been unemployed for a long time and were only employed by the Lhasa Military Control Commission after the rebellion was quelled. Farmers from the suburbs also rushed to participate in today's grand parade. In the past few days, they had received interest-free loans of seeds and grain from the Military Control Commission and were engaged in intensive spring plowing and sowing.
    The citizens of Lhasa have just established their own self-governing organizations – residents' committees. Today, they held high horizontal banners with the names of each residents' committee written on them. Some wore new clothes, some beat gongs and drums, and some danced the "Yak Dance," cheering and advancing on the streets. Some residents' committees had their patriotic security pledges, patriotic sanitation pledges, and patriotic production plans written on their flags. The citizens of Lhasa organized themselves to formulate plans for building a new life, which was the first time in their history.
    More than 2,000 lamas from Tibet's most famous monasteries – Drepung Monastery, Sera Monastery, and Jokhang Temple – participated in the demonstration. One lama said excitedly: "Although our lamas' faces are dark, our hearts are bright today, as if the sun has come out." They were very indignant at the shameless slander of imperialism and foreign reactionaries who falsely accused the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army of "destroying religion" in Tibet. They said: The real destroyers of religion are those poisonous snakes in cassocks – the rebels.
    At 12:00 noon, the parade of demonstrators continuously passed in front of the Jokhang Temple and moved towards the People's Square in front of the Potala Palace. When the last team of demonstrators passed in front of the Jokhang Temple, the streets of Lhasa were almost empty. The demonstrators and residents all gathered in the People's Square, where they were to hold a mass meeting of people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life to resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 15th - Lhasa citizens held a grand rally today to denounce the crimes of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique for betraying the motherland and launching an armed rebellion. This was a mobilization meeting to thoroughly quell the rebellion, and also an indictment meeting against the traitorous and harmful crimes of the reactionary clique. The people participating in the meeting unanimously expressed their determination to fight resolutely for the thorough suppression of the rebellion and for the construction of a new Tibet.
    At 12:30 noon, the parade of more than 20,000 people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Lhasa City all gathered at the People's Square in front of the Potala Palace. The square was full of red flags, the masses shouted slogans, and the atmosphere was boiling. A team of People's Liberation Army soldiers participated in the meeting and were warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups.
    At the beginning of the meeting, two Tibetan Young Pioneers solemnly raised the national flag from the center of the square to the sound of military music. A group of Tibetan young men and women dressed in new clothes presented flowers to the People's Liberation Army, thanking them for quelling the rebellion in Lhasa, safeguarding the unity of the motherland and national unity, and defending the interests of the Tibetan people.
    Deng Shaodong, director of the Lhasa Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army, spoke to the masses attending the meeting. He said: "The purpose of the rebellion by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet is very vicious. With the support of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and foreign reactionaries, they are attempting to use armed rebellion to maintain their feudal serfdom rule, obstruct the thorough liberation of the Tibetan people, undermine the unity of the motherland, undermine the national unity between Tibetans and Hans, and attempt to sell out the Tibetan people, so that the Tibetan people will once again be enslaved by imperialism." He called on the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Lhasa City to actively mobilize, continue to assist the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly suppressing the rebellion in Tibet, and fight to smash all the conspiracies of the Tibetan traitorous group and imperialism.
    Deng Shaodong said that since its establishment, the Lhasa Military Control Commission has achieved great successes in restoring peace and order in Lhasa, implementing the Party's various policies, organizing labor and employment, issuing agricultural loans, helping the masses with spring plowing and production, and providing relief to the poor people. Therefore, the Military Control Commission has been loved and supported by the people.
    Hui Yiran, Secretary of the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, first expressed his high respect to the troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet who had contributed to the suppression of the rebellion in his speech, paid tribute to the Lhasa organ militia who had cooperated with the troops in suppressing the rebellion, and the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Lhasa who actively supported the suppression of the rebellion, and expressed cordial condolences to the citizens of Lhasa who had suffered from the rebels. He hoped that all the people in the city would live and work in peace and seize the spring plowing and production, and not waste an acre of land. He reiterated the Party's policy of national equality and unity and the policy of freedom of religious belief to the meeting. He said: "Freedom of religious belief is stipulated by our country's constitution. In the past, the People's Liberation Army and personnel entering Tibet resolutely implemented this policy, and will continue to implement this policy in the future, protecting the monasteries and cultural relics."
    Sangpo Tenzin Dhondup, deputy director of the Lhasa Military Control Commission, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the people of Lhasa were extremely excited to welcome the coming of the new day of the Tibetan people, and firmly supported the State Council's order of March 28. He said: "In order for the Tibetan people to live a better and happier life, everyone should unite and work hard under the leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Military Region."
    The Tibetan traitorous group and imperialism said that the Tibetan rebellion was for the benefit of the Tibetan people. The people participating in the meeting refuted these hypocritical lies with bloody facts. Yangji, the former maid of the rebel leader Lhukangwa, accused at the meeting that Lhukangwa forced her family to die, flee, or become disabled or beggars. The people of Lhasa all knew the notorious reactionary crimes of Lhukangwa. In 1952, he organized a pseudo-"People's Conference" to plot a rebellion. After that conspiracy was exposed, he was sheltered by the former Tibetan local government. This time, he organized rebels abroad to carry out armed rebellion. This elderly Tibetan woman endured a lifetime of dark slave life in Lhukangwa's home. Today, when she accused him on stage, her voice was stern and her emotions were extremely agitated.
    Ma Mingliang, a Hui resident of Lhasa City, accused at the meeting that on March 20, the rebels set fire to the Lhasa Mosque and 19 Hui people's houses, and robbed the property of 24 Hui people's families. The Hui residents here have lived in Lhasa for several generations. They have close relations with the Tibetan residents, but because they opposed the rebellion and refused to participate in the rebel meetings, they were persecuted by the rebels.
    Tibetan young woman Tsering Lhazom tearfully accused the rebel leader Kundeling Dzasa of coercing her elderly father to participate in the rebellion. The whereabouts of her father are still unknown. She and her old mother and four young siblings live in a dilapidated tent, without food or clothing, and their lives are very difficult. After the rebellion in Lhasa was quelled, the Military Control Commission immediately introduced her to a job, giving her family a new opportunity for a new life.
    Lobsang Rinchen, a lama from the Potala Palace, and Ngawang Lhundrub, a lama from the Jokhang Temple, exposed the rebels' behavior of destroying religion at the meeting. Lobsang Rinchen was once forced to participate in the rebellion by rebels with guns. Later, he escaped from the Pengbo area and returned. He accused the rebels of robbing the people and raping nuns in the Pengbo area. Ngawang Lhundrub accused that on March 19, 20, and 21, hundreds of rebels forcibly occupied the Jokhang Temple. The rebels forced the lamas to change into Tibetan robes and participate in the rebellion, drove the sutra-chanting lamas out of the Buddha hall, defecated in the Buddha hall, plundered golden Buddha statues, and finally beat to death the lama Qinrao Jiangba, who opposed the rebels, and injured the lama Kelsang Wangjie.
    The people's accusations moved the People's Liberation Army participating in the meeting extremely. Their representative expressed his determination to the meeting and said: "We swear to the Party and the people that the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet will resolutely implement the order of the State Council and realize the earnest hope of the Tibetan people for us. We must unite all patriotic monks and lay people and resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion in Tibet. We will never withdraw our troops until the rebels in the Tibetan area are completely annihilated!" His speech aroused a storm of applause from the audience.
    The meeting finally passed a telegram calling on people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Tibet to resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion, and passed a letter of condolences to the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet. At this time, thunderous applause and slogans broke out in the venue. People waved red flags and once again shouted "Celebrate the victory of suppressing the rebellion in the Lhasa area!" "Resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, Chairman Mao!"
    After the meeting, people gathered in the square to watch the literary and artistic performances celebrating the victory of suppressing the rebellion in the Lhasa area. The Tibetan Military Region Cultural Troupe and the Henan Opera Troupe performed wonderful programs, and the waist drum teams of Lhasa middle and primary schools performed. On the other side of the square, tap dancing was performed, and people were also drawn into the dance circle with the rhythm. The joyful crowd sang and danced in the square until dusk.

　　彻底平息叛乱，坚决走民主和社会主义道路！
　　西藏人民永远忠于祖国  拉萨两万人空前大示威
　　在布达拉宫前人们纷纷控诉叛匪的滔天罪行
    新华社拉萨15日电　两万多名拉萨市民今天庄严地举行了坚决要求彻底平息叛乱的示威游行。参加示威的群众占拉萨全市人口的三分之二，这是西藏历史上从来没有过的一次强大的示威游行。这一次示威游行充分显示了西藏人民永远忠于祖国、热爱共产党和毛主席、坚决走民主和社会主义道路的真诚愿望，以及他们坚决反对叛乱的高昂的斗争意志。
    参加示威的人们——成千成万的藏族居民和喇嘛们，结队穿过大街小巷，他们振臂用藏语高呼口号：“庆祝拉萨地区平叛的胜利！”“坚决彻底平息叛乱！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    今天清晨，当拉萨河谷还弥漫着晓雾的时候，拉萨市民就成群结队地向市中心汇集。全市普遍悬挂国旗，许多妇女穿上了花衣服，她们挥舞小旗，敲打乐器，抬着巨幅漫画和标语牌兴奋地参加了游行。上午十时，市中心的八角街上汇集了大量的游行队伍，那里有藏、回、汉各族人民，有数千名喇嘛，有爱国的中上层人士，有商人、民兵、带着孩子的妇女以及一些七、八十岁的老人。队伍通过那里整整花了两个多小时。树立在八角街上的许多巨幅标语上写着：“西藏各族各界人民团结起来，坚决彻底平息叛乱！”滚滚人流和数不清的旗帜、标语，使这座有一千多年历史的高原古城显得分外雄伟壮丽。
    游行队伍浩浩荡荡地前进。人们原来估计这次示威游行将有一万人参加，可是今天走上街头的人数超过了两万。一些被叛乱分子夺去了父母的孤儿，在原西藏地方政府的统治下一向受人蔑视的贫苦市民和残废者也参加了示威的行列。在藏、汉工人的队伍中，有许多人过去长期失业，在叛乱平息后才由拉萨军管会介绍就业。郊区的农民也赶来参加了今天的盛大游行，这几天他们获得了军管会无息贷放的种子和粮食，正在进行紧张的春耕播种。
    拉萨的市民刚刚成立起他们自己管理自己的组织——居民委员会。今天他们高举着写着各个居民委员会名字的横幅旗帜，有的穿着新衣，有的敲着锣鼓，有的跳着“牦牛舞”，在街道上欢呼前进。有些居民委员会的旗上写着他们的爱国治安公约、爱国卫生公约和爱国生产计划。拉萨市民组织起来自己订出建设新生活的计划，这在他们历史上还是第一次。
    西藏最著名的寺院——哲蚌寺、色拉寺和大昭寺，有二千多名喇嘛参加了示威游行。一个喇嘛兴奋地说：“我们喇嘛的脸虽然是黑的，今天心里却亮堂，像似出了太阳一样。”他们对帝国主义和国外反动派诬蔑中国共产党和人民解放军在西藏“摧残宗教”的无耻滥言非常愤慨。他们说：真正摧残宗教的是那些披着袈裟的毒蛇——叛乱分子。
    中午十二时，示威游行的队伍络绎不绝地经过大昭寺门前，向布达拉宫前面的人民广场移动。当最后一队示威群众通过大昭寺前的时候，拉萨市区街道上几乎是空荡荡的了，举行示威游行的人们和居民都集中到人民广场，他们要在那里举行各族各界人民坚决彻底平息叛乱的群众大会。
    新华社拉萨15日电　拉萨市民今天举行盛大集会，声讨原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团背叛祖国发动武装叛乱的罪行。这是一次彻底平息叛乱的动员大会，也是一次对反动集团叛国害民罪行的控诉大会，参加大会的人们一致表示要为彻底平息叛乱、为建设新西藏进行坚决的斗争。
    中午十二时半，拉萨市二万多名各族各界人民的游行队伍全部汇集到了布达拉宫前的人民广场。那里红旗如林，群众高呼口号，情绪沸腾，一队人民解放军战士参加了大会，他们受到了各族人民的热烈欢迎。
    大会开始，两个藏族少先队员在军乐声中庄严地从广场中央升起了国旗，一群穿着新装的藏族男女青年向人民解放军献了鲜花，感谢他们平息了拉萨的叛乱，维护了祖国的统一和民族团结，保卫了西藏人民的利益。
    人民解放军拉萨军事管制委员会主任邓少东向参加大会的群众讲了话。他说：“西藏上层反动集团进行叛乱的目的是十分恶毒的，他们在帝国主义、蒋介石集团和外国反动派的支持下，妄图用武装叛乱来维持其封建的农奴统治，阻挡西藏人民的彻底解放，破坏祖国统一，破坏藏、汉族之间的民族团结，企图出卖西藏人民，让西藏人民重新受帝国主义的奴役”。他号召拉萨市各族各界人民积极动员起来，继续协助人民解放军彻底平息西藏的叛乱，为粉碎西藏叛国集团和帝国主义的一切阴谋而斗争。
    邓少东说，拉萨军管会自成立以来，在恢复拉萨和平秩序，执行党的各项政策，组织劳动就业，发放农贷，帮助群众春耕生产和对贫苦人民进行救济等工作上，都取得了很大成绩，因此，军管会受到了人民的爱戴和拥护。
    中共拉萨市委书记惠毅然在讲话中首先向平息叛乱有功的人民解放军驻西藏部队致崇高的敬意，向配合部队平叛有功的拉萨机关民兵和积极支援平叛的拉萨市各族各界人民致敬，向遭受叛匪蹂躏的拉萨市民表示亲切的慰问。他希望全市人民各安生业，抓紧春耕生产，不荒一亩土地。他向大会重申了党的民族平等团结政策和宗教信仰自由政策。他说：“宗教信仰自由是我国宪法所规定了的，过去，进藏人民解放军和工作人员坚决贯彻执行了这一政策，今后仍将继续贯彻执行这一政策，保护喇嘛寺庙和文物古迹。”
    拉萨市军管会副主任桑颇·才旺仁增也在大会上讲了话。他说，拉萨人民万分兴奋地迎接西藏人民新生日子的来临，坚决拥护国务院3月28日的命令。他说：“为了西藏人民能过更好的幸福生活，大家应团结一致，在中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹备委员会和西藏军区的领导下，努力作好自己的工作。”
    西藏叛国集团和帝国主义把西藏叛乱说成是为了西藏人民的利益，参加大会的人们用血淋淋的事实驳斥了这些虚伪的谎言。叛匪首领鲁康娃过去的女佣人央吉在会上控诉鲁康娃将她一家逼得死的死、逃的逃，活着的不是残废，就是成了乞丐。拉萨的人们都熟知臭名昭著的鲁康娃的反动罪行，在1952年他就组织伪“人民会议”，阴谋发动叛乱，那次阴谋被揭发以后，他受到了原西藏地方政府的庇护，这次他又在国外组织叛乱分子进行武装叛乱。这个老年的藏族妇女在鲁康娃家里忍受了一生黑暗的奴隶生活，今天她在台上控诉的时候声色俱厉，感情极为激动。
    拉萨市的回族居民马明良，在大会上控诉了叛匪在3月20日放火烧掉拉萨清真寺和十九家回族民房，以及抢劫二十四家回民财物的罪行。这里的回族居民已经在拉萨住了好几代，他们和藏族居民有着亲密的关系，只是因为他们反对叛乱，拒绝参加叛乱的集会，便遭到叛匪的迫害。
    藏族青年妇女茨仁拉宗含着眼泪控诉了叛匪头子功德林扎萨胁迫她年老的父亲参加叛乱的罪行。她的父亲至今生死不明，她和老母以及四个年幼的弟妹住在一间破烂的帐篷里，没吃没穿，生活非常困苦。拉萨叛乱平息后，军管会立即给她介绍了工作，使她们一家人又重新获得了新生的机会。
    布达拉宫的喇嘛洛桑仁钦和大昭寺的喇嘛阿旺隆登在大会上揭露了叛匪破坏宗教的行为。洛桑仁钦一度被叛匪用枪胁逼参加了叛乱，以后从彭波地区逃跑回来，他控诉了亲眼看见叛匪在彭波地区抢劫人民，强奸尼姑的罪行。阿旺隆登控诉3月19日、20日和21日三天几百名叛匪强占大昭寺的情形，叛匪们强迫喇嘛换上藏袍参加叛乱，并把念经的喇嘛赶出佛殿，在佛殿里拉屎拉尿，掠夺金佛像，最后还打死了反对叛匪的喇嘛钦绕江巴，打伤了喇嘛格桑旺杰。
    人民的控诉使参加大会的人民解放军极为激动。他们的代表向大会表示决心说：“我们向党向人民宣誓，驻藏人民解放军坚决执行国务院的命令，实现西藏人民对我们的殷切希望，我们一定团结一切爱国的僧俗人民，坚决彻底地平息西藏叛乱，不彻底歼灭西藏地区的叛匪，决不收兵！”他的讲话激起了全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    大会最后通过了号召西藏各族各界人民坚决彻底平息叛乱的电文，通过了给人民解放军驻藏部队的慰问信。这时会场上爆发出雷鸣般的掌声和口号声，人们挥动着红旗，再次高呼“庆祝拉萨地区平叛的胜利！”“坚决彻底平息叛乱！”“中国共产党万岁！”“全国各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
    大会结束以后，人们聚集在广场上观看了庆祝拉萨地区平叛胜利的文艺演出。西藏军区文工团和豫剧队表演了精采节目，拉萨中、小学的腰鼓队作了表演。广场的另一边跳起了踢踏舞，人们随着节奏也卷入了舞圈，欢乐的人群在广场上唱歌跳舞，一直到黄昏。
