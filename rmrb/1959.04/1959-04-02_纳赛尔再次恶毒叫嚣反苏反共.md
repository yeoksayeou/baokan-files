Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 1st:  President Nasser of the United Arab Republic delivered a speech here on the evening of March 30th, again vehemently attacking the Soviet Union and the Communist Party. This was his first speech since recently returning here after spending more than a month in Syria.

In a speech delivered at the conclusion of the annual exercises of the Third and Fourth Regiments of the UAR Armed Forces, Nasser reiterated such slanders as "the Soviet Union openly interferes in the internal affairs of the UAR," "Communist agents accept instructions from Moscow," and "there is an alliance between the Soviet Union and the Communist agents of the UAR." He attacked the Soviet Union as "undemocratic." He even described Khrushchev's advice to the UAR as "wanting to incite emotions in the UAR." He also said, "Today we are facing a campaign of hatred launched by Communists in all Arab countries, which is supported by international communism."

Nasser still tried his best to deny the fact that Egypt had received assistance from the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries when resisting the tripartite aggression of Britain, France, and Israel. He repeatedly emphasized, "We did not receive any assistance." "No great power in the world stood with us, and we won." Nasser also flatly denied that "the UAR is trying to merge Arab countries." But he said, "We will never give the Communists any chance to gain a foothold in Iraq to oppose the UAR."

On the same evening, the National Union, the only "mass organization" in the Egyptian region, organized a mass meeting here. Anwar Sadat, the Secretary-General of the Union, viciously slandered the Soviet Union at the meeting for "wanting to impose a new rule on the UAR." He said, "The Soviet Union has entered the battle with Kassem against the UAR, defending the Communist agents of the UAR.” He also said: "The battle we are fighting today is more dangerous than the tripartite aggression, because the communist agents want to invade us from within."

    纳赛尔再次恶毒叫嚣反苏反共
    新华社1日讯　开罗消息：阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔3月30日晚上在这里发表演说，再次猛烈攻击苏联和共产党。这是他在叙利亚呆了一个多月以后最近回到这里以来的第一篇演说。
    纳赛尔在阿联武装部队第三团和第四团的年度演习结束时发表的演说中，再次重复着所谓“苏联公开干涉阿联内政”、“共产党代理人接受莫斯科的指示”、苏联和阿联的“共产党代理人之间存在着联盟”这类诬蔑。他攻击苏联“不民主”。他竟把赫鲁晓夫对阿联的忠告说成是“想在阿联煽动起人们的情绪”。他还说，“今天我们面对着所有阿拉伯国家的共产党人都在发动的仇视运动，它们得到国际共产主义的支持”。
    纳赛尔仍然竭力否认埃及在抵抗英、法、以色列三国侵略的时候曾经得到苏联和其他爱好和平国家援助的事实。他一再强调说，“我们没有得到任何援助”。“世界上没有任何强国和我们站在一起，而我们胜利了”。纳赛尔还矢口否认“阿联力图合并阿拉伯国家”。但是他说，“我们决不给共产党任何机会盘踞在伊拉克来反对阿联。”
    在同一天晚上，埃及地区唯一的“群众性组织”民族联盟在这里组织了群众大会，联盟的总书记安瓦尔·萨达特在会上恶毒地诬蔑苏联“想强加新的统治于阿联”。他说，“苏联进入了同卡塞姆一起反对阿联，保卫阿联的共产党代理人的战斗”。他还说：“今天我们正在进行的战斗比三国侵略更加危险，因为共产党代理人要从内部侵犯我们。”
