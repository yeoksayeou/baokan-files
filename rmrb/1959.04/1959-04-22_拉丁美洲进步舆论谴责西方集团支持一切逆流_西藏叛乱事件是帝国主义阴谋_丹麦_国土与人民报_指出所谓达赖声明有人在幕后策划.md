Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: Progressive public opinion in some Latin American countries has condemned the malicious propaganda carried out by Western newspapers on the issue of Tibet, China.

A commentary published by the Colombian "Latin America" radio magazine on the 17th said that the purpose of the current propaganda carried out by international newspapers and commentators characterized by supporting colonialism and imperialism is nothing more than a conspiracy to sharpen international tensions and obstruct the friendly relations between India and China, two friendly neighbors. The commentary pointed out that Tibet's production methods are the most backward in the world, with most agricultural production using wooden plows. Similarly, Tibet's production relations are also the most backward in the world. Since 1951, the Chinese government has brought civilization to Tibet. However, all these efforts immediately aroused dissatisfaction among vested interest groups. Although the feudal system remains intact and the large estate owners still have the power of life and death over the peasants, some aggressive warmongering groups and the notorious Kuomintang group are taking advantage of this situation to oppose the enormous work being done by the Chinese government. This shows the world how imperialism and its mercenary propagandists support all逆流 on earth as an excuse to incite war and provoke discord among the peoples of various countries.

An article recently published by the Argentine "People's Alliance" newspaper pointed out that the Tibetan rebellion was "an imperialist conspiracy" in which they used remnants left over from the old era to incite rebellion, and then they talked loudly about "aggression." The newspaper emphasized that "it must be remembered that Tibet is part of the People's Republic of China, and it must implement the laws voted for by its own representatives in the central government." The "People's Alliance" newspaper said, "The imperialist propaganda machine is trying to make the Tibetan incident a 'second Hungarian incident,' but they have failed."

The Brazilian weekly "New Orientation" said on the 9th that the imperialists are interested in the Tibetan rebellion, but the "rapid end of the rebellion shows that it has no connection with the people and does not receive their support."

The Chilean "Century News" also recently published an article condemning the imperialist propaganda on the Tibet issue, pointing out that the purpose of imperialism is to divide China and use Tibet as a base for war adventures.

Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: Copenhagen news. The Danish Communist Party's organ, "Land and People's Daily," published articles on the 19th and 20th condemning Danish bourgeois newspapers for using the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" to slander China.

The article said that people "can doubt the authenticity" of this statement. The article pointed out that this statement was at least masterminded behind the scenes because it contains obvious lies about the Chinese government's policies towards Tibet. The article pointed out that Tibet has not yet taken any steps towards socialism. Moreover, the fact that 75% of the residents are still serfs answers the reactionary clamor of so-called "Chinese interference in Tibet's internal affairs."

The article, in refuting the lie that the central government "destroyed the 1951 agreement," pointed out that the Chinese Central People's Government has always abided by this agreement. It said that due to the destruction of this agreement by the Tibetan local government, the reorganization of the Tibetan army stipulated in the 1951 agreement and the implementation of democratic reforms in Tibet have not yet been implemented.

The article emphasized that U.S. imperialism is attempting to use the Tibetan rebellion to sow discord between China's neighbors and China. The United States has been active in Southeast Asia for a long time, attempting to create new centers of tension to undermine the five-year-old principle of peaceful coexistence between China and India.

    拉丁美洲进步舆论谴责西方集团支持一切逆流
    西藏叛乱事件是帝国主义阴谋
    丹麦“国土与人民报”指出所谓达赖声明有人在幕后策划
    新华社20日讯　拉丁美洲一些国家的进步舆论谴责西方报刊就中国西藏问题所进行的恶意宣传。
    哥伦比亚“拉丁美洲”广播杂志17日发表的评论说，目前国际报刊和以拥护殖民主义及帝国主义为特色的评论家所进行的宣传，其目的只不过是使国际紧张局势尖锐化以及阻挠印度和中国这两个友好邻邦之间的友好关系的阴谋。评论指出，西藏的生产方法是世界上最落后的，大部分农业生产是用木犁。同样的，西藏的生产关系也是世界上最落后的。自从1951年以后，中国政府把文明带给西藏。但是这一切努力立刻引起了既得利益集团的不满，虽然现在封建制度仍然原封未动，大庄园主对农民还有生杀大权，而一些侵略成性的好战集团同声名狼籍的国民党集团利用这种形势反对中国政府所进行的巨大工作。这向全世界表明，帝国主义同他们的雇佣的宣传家是如何支持地球上的一切逆流，以此作为煽动战争和挑拨各国人民之间不和的借口。
    阿根廷“人民同盟报”最近发表文章指出，西藏叛乱事件是“帝国主义的阴谋诡计”，他们利用旧时代遗留下来的残余分子来鼓动叛乱，然后他们就大谈发生了“侵略”。报纸强调指出，“必须记住，西藏是中华人民共和国的一部分，它必须执行它自己的代表在中央政府里投票赞成的法律”。“人民同盟报”说，“帝国主义的宣传机构企图使西藏事件成为‘第二次匈牙利事件’，但是它们失败了。”
    巴西的“新方针”周刊9日说，对西藏叛乱感兴趣的是帝国主义者，但是西藏“叛乱的迅速结束表明它同人民没有关系，它得不到人民的支持”。
    智利“世纪报”最近也发表文章谴责帝国主义就西藏问题所进行的宣传，报纸指出，帝国主义的目的是要分割中国和利用西藏作为战争冒险的基地。
    新华社21日讯　哥本哈根消息，丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民报”在19和20日先后发表文章谴责丹麦资产阶级报纸利用所谓“达赖的声明”对中国进行的污蔑。
    文章说，人们对这个声明“可以怀疑其真实性”。文章指出，这个声明至少是有人在幕后策划的，因为它对中国政府对西藏的政策包含明显的谎言。文章指出，西藏到目前为止，仍未采取任何走向社会主义的步骤。而且居民中仍有75％是农奴，这一事实本身就回答了反动派所谓“中国干涉西藏内政”的恶毒叫嚣。
    文章在驳斥所谓中央政府“破坏1951年协议”的谎言的时候指出，中国中央人民政府一贯遵守这项协议。它说，由于西藏地方政府破坏这项协议，以致1951年协议所规定的藏军改编和在西藏实行民主改革迄今都未经实行。
    文章强调指出，美帝国主义企图利用西藏叛乱事件挑拨离间中国的邻国和中国的关系。美国很久以来就在东南亚大肆活动，企图制造新的紧张中心来破坏中印之间达五年之久的和平共处原则。
