    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 26th. The latest issue of the "Blitz" weekly published an editorial condemning the anti-China activities of the imperialist newspapers and the Indian Praja Socialist Party.

    The editorial pointed out that those who are guilty persist in their actions "precisely because they hope to turn this country into one of the frightened countries that ask the United States to build bomber bases. To those innocent and guilty, to both types of impatient warriors engaged in the anti-China Cold War, we say: 'Ladies and Gentlemen! We have enough common sense, we will not be fooled by you.'"

    "Blitz" weekly also published a report on its front page from its editor, Karanjia, from Geneva.

    He said that during his visit to the Arab East, he had met several American and Pakistani diplomats, "who almost all said in unison that they expected a major conflict between India and China, if the Tibetan dispute could be prolonged until the end of the year." He said, "According to their subjective wishes (or, according to their plans?), this conflict will force Delhi to open a new battlefield against China."

    He added that the Americans have not even ruled out the possibility of turning countries like India, Pakistan, Burma, Ceylon, and Nepal into a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization-style war group, "this war group is built on the fear of China's aggression against the strategic Indian Ocean region."

    Karanjia said, "Of course, in all these wishful plans, the Western countries and their Asian agents do not count on their master Nehru and the Indian people (who are bound by the historical necessity of positive neutrality and a policy of friendship towards China, despite the impact of events like the situation in Tibet on India's attitude). They can only count on their running dogs and servants, like Masani of the Tata family and India's 'socialists', who find their natural allies among India's fascists and Hindu Mahasabha elements."

    He said, "Despite this, all of this should make those idiots reconsider who are attacking the Chinese Embassy and consulates in India, desperately trying to incite Nehru to break with China, which he does not favor."

    印度“闪电”周报发表评论
    严斥印度反动派热衷反华冷战
    揭露他们力图促使尼赫鲁同中国决裂
    新华社新德里26日电　最近一期的“闪电”周报发表社论，谴责帝国主义的报纸和印度人民社会党进行反对中国的活动。
    社论指出，那些有罪的人坚持他们的做法，“正是因为他们希望把这个国家变成一个要求美国来建立轰炸机基地的受惊的国家之一。对于那些无罪的和有罪的人，对于这两类参加反对中国的冷战的急躁的战士们，我们说：‘女士们，先生们！我们有足够的常识，我们不会受你们的骗。’”
    “闪电”周报还在第一版上发表了它的主编卡朗吉亚发自日内瓦的一篇报道。
    他说，在他访问阿拉伯东方期间，他见过几个美国和巴基斯坦的外交官员，“他们几乎都异口同声地说，他们预料印度和中国将发生大冲突，如果西藏纠纷能够拖长到年底的话。”他说，“根据他们的主观愿望（或者，根据他们的计划？）这种冲突将迫使德里开辟反对中国的新战场。”
    他又说，美国人甚至没有排除这种可能性：即把印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、锡兰、尼泊尔等国家变成东南亚条约组织式的战争集团的国家，“这种战争集团是建立在害怕中国对战略性的印度洋地区进行侵略的心理上的”。
    卡朗吉亚说，“当然，在所有这些一相情愿的计划中，西方国家和它们的亚洲代理人不指望他们的主人尼赫鲁和印度人民（他们历史的必要性而受到积极中立和对中国友好的政策的约束，尽管印度的态度受到了像西藏事态发展那样的影响）。他们只能指望他们的走狗和仆从，像塔塔家族的马萨尼和印度的‘社会主义者’，这些人在印度的法西斯主义者和印度教大会分子中，找到了他们天然的盟友。”
    他说，“尽管这样，所有这一切应当使那些白痴重新考虑考虑，他们攻击中国驻印度的大使馆和领事馆，拼命企图促使尼赫鲁同中国决裂，而他并不赞成同中国决裂。”
