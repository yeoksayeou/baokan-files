Actively Purchase and Utilize Waste Products
*People's Daily* Commentator

Waste products are discarded materials constantly generated in people's daily production and life. However, collecting these discarded materials, sorting, and processing them can transform them into new and useful resources, many of which can be used as industrial raw materials. Therefore, vigorously purchasing and utilizing waste products is an important way to increase industrial raw materials and a significant measure for increasing production and practicing economy.

Approximately 80% or more of waste products can be used as industrial raw materials. For example, mixed copper, scrap steel, waste tin and lead, and waste aluminum are materials needed in steel and machinery production. Copper, in particular, is an important raw material in modern industrial production. Therefore, the recovery of mixed copper is an important task. Other materials such as rags, old shoe soles, waste cotton, waste linen, and linen products are not only raw materials for making high-quality paper, but rags can also be used to make shoe soles, weave cotton blankets, and make sofa fabrics. After chemical treatment, rags can be made into cold-resistant, heat-resistant, and wear-resistant plastic cloth, which can be used to make machine parts and telecommunications equipment. Waste rubber can be processed into reclaimed rubber to manufacture rubber shoes, rubber cloth, and various other rubber products. Broken glass can be processed into various novel glass products. Waste aluminum can be used to make various aluminum utensils; mixed bones can be used to extract bone oil, bone meal, and superphosphate for making soap and fertilizer. Even fish scales discarded from washing fish can be used to extract fish scale glue, and fish skin can also be used to make leather. Some waste materials can be used after simple sorting or repair, such as wine bottles, ink bottles, medicine bottles, and used clothing.

In recent years, commercial departments have made great achievements in the acquisition and utilization of waste materials. In particular, last year, driven by the overall Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the work of purchasing waste products also experienced a new leap forward. Last year, the total value of waste products purchased was nearly 1.6 billion yuan, including 2.7 million tons of scrap steel and more than 190,000 tons of mixed copper, which played a significant role in industrial production. This year, with the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the need for waste materials is becoming increasingly widespread. Therefore, commercial departments must continue to strengthen their acquisition efforts to meet the growing needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives.

Based on last year's experience, to do a good job in the acquisition of waste products, in addition to strengthening the regular acquisition work, acquisition departments in various localities must also closely focus on the central work of each period under the unified leadership of the Party committees and seize every opportunity that can be utilized to carry out acquisitions. Currently, it is the season of spring warmth and blooming flowers. In rural areas, acquisition departments can focus on spring plowing production and combine it with the elimination of the four pests and promoting hygiene to carry out one or two concentrated campaigns to recover waste products. In cities, the experience of last year's "industry combating drought" can be used to vigorously promote waste product recovery.

Because the characteristics of waste products are that they are scattered, fragmented, everywhere, and related to everyone, every family, and every unit, it is necessary to do a good job in publicity when acquiring waste products. This will ensure that everyone knows that recycling waste products is beneficial to the country and to themselves, overcoming the idea that some people find it troublesome to collect waste products and embarrassing to sell them. This will gradually cultivate the habit of collecting waste products and selling them in a timely manner.

In order to expand the acquisition of waste products and better support industrial and agricultural production, acquisition departments in various localities should also actively carry out waste product sorting,整理 and processing businesses in accordance with local conditions. In this way, on the one hand, some waste materials, such as rural waterwheels, cotton gins, and small agricultural tools, can be re-supplied after repair and configuration to support production. On the other hand, comprehensive utilization (such as mixed bones, batteries, etc.) can be carried out to increase the use value of various waste products. Last year, various localities created a lot of experience under the slogan of "turning useless into useful, turning one use into multiple uses, and turning waste into new." This year, this should continue to be promoted and developed. For some materials with unreasonable purchase prices, the price should be determined according to its use value and graded to encourage the masses to collect and sell waste products.

The potential of waste products is enormous. At the same time, waste products are like the metabolism of living things. They are constantly generated with the continuous progress of production and consumption and the continuous alternation of new and old materials. It can be said that it is a huge social wealth that is "inexhaustible and inexhaustible." As long as Party committees at all levels attach importance to the work of waste product recovery and mobilize the masses, a large number of waste materials can be acquired to serve industrial and agricultural production and people's lives.

    积极收购和利用废品
    本报评论员
    废品是人们日常生产和生活中不断产生的废旧物资。但是把这些废旧物资搜集起来，经过整理和加工，就可以变为新的有用的物资，其中有许多可以作工业原料。因此，大力收购和利用废品，是增加工业原料的重要途径，也是增产节约的重要措施。
    废品中约有80％以上的物资可用作工业原料，如杂铜、废钢铁、废锡铅、废铝等，是钢铁、机械生产中需要的物资，特别是铜，更是现代工业生产中重要的原材料。因此，杂铜回收，就是一项重要任务。其他如破布、破鞋底、废旧棉、废麻及麻制品等，不仅是制造高级纸的原料，而且破布可做鞋底、织棉毯和作沙发布。破布经过化学处理，可以制成耐寒耐热耐磨的胶布塑料，这种胶布塑料可用来做机器配件和电讯器材。废橡胶可以加工成再生胶，制造胶鞋、胶布等各种胶制品，碎玻璃可加工制造各种新颖的玻璃制品。废铝可制造各种铝制器皿；杂骨可提制骨油、骨粉、过磷酸钙等，用来制肥皂、肥料。就是洗鱼所抛弃的鱼鳞也可以提炼鱼鳞胶，鱼皮还可以制革。还有些废旧物资，只要经过简单的整理或修配，就可以使用。如酒瓶、墨水瓶、药瓶、估衣等。
    几年来，商业部门在收购和利用废旧物资方面已取得了很大的成绩。特别是去年，在工农业生产全面大跃进的推动下，收购废品工作也出现了一个新的跃进。去年全年废品收购总额近十六亿元，其中仅废钢铁就收购了二百七十万吨，杂铜十九万多吨，对工业生产起了很大作用。今年，随着工农业生产更大的跃进，对废旧物资的需要也越来越广。因此，商业部门必须继续加强收购工作，才能适应工农业生产和人民生活日益增长的需要。
    根据去年的经验，要做好废品收购工作，各地收购部门除了要加强经常性的收购工作外，还必须在党委统一领导下，紧密地围绕着各个时期的中心工作，抓住一切可以利用的时机，进行收购。当前正是春暖花开的季节，在农村，收购部门可以以春耕生产为中心，结合除四害、讲卫生，开展一、两次废品回收的突击运动。在城市里，更可以运用去年“工业抗旱”的经验，大搞废品回收。
    由于废品的特点是分散零星、到处都有，和每个人、每个家庭、每个单位都有关系，因此，收购废品必须做好宣传工作，使大家都知道回收废品对国家有利、对自己也有好处，克服有些人认为集攒废品麻烦、出售废品不好意思的思想，使大家逐渐养成集攒废品、及时出售废品的习惯。
    为了扩大废品的收购量，更好地支援工农业生产，各地收购部门还应该因地制宜地积极开展废品挑选、整理和加工业务。这样一方面对某些废旧物资，如农村的水车、轧花机、小型农具等，经过整修和配制，可重新供应，支持生产；另一方面还可以综合利用（如杂骨、电池等），提高各种废品的使用价值。去年各地在“无用变有用，一用变多用，废旧变崭新”的口号下，已创造了很多经验，今年应该继续加以推广和发扬。对某些收购价格不合理的物资，应根据它的使用价值，分等论价，以鼓励群众搜集和出售废品的积极性。
    废品的潜力是巨大的，同时，废品也好像生物的新陈代谢作用一样，随着生产和消费的不断进行，新旧物资的不断交替而不断产生着。可以说，它是“取之不尽，用之不竭”的巨大社会财富。只要各级党委重视废品回收工作，发动群众，就能够把大批的废旧物资收购起来，为工农业生产和人民生活服务。
