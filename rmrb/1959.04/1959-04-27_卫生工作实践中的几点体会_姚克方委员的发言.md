Some Experiences in Health Work Practice
Speech by Committee Member Yao Kefang

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the CPPCC, and I am willing to implement them in my future work.

1958 was a year of decisive victory for our country on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, and also a year of great leap forward, "one year equals twenty years". This was an extraordinary year of far-reaching historical significance. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with politics taking command, fully relying on the masses, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, breaking superstitions, and giving full play to the masses' highly positive attitude of daring to think and act, could we have overcome various difficulties and created countless unprecedented miracles.

Seeing off the "God of Plague," the People Find Health and Happiness

Along with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the health work in Hubei Province, centered on eliminating pests and diseases, has also made vigorous progress like the rest of the country in the past year.

Hubei Province is located in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, with lakes and marshes scattered throughout. The climate is warm and humid. Every year, it is affected by the rising and falling of the Yangtze River floods, and the vast lake and swamp areas form a landscape of summer water and winter land, which is greatly conducive to the breeding of parasitic disease vectors, allowing parasitic diseases and certain acute infectious diseases to spread, seriously endangering and threatening the health of the people and harming the growth of labor power. Moreover, due to the long-term rule of the Kuomintang, they were indifferent to the suffering of the people and never took any measures to prevent and control these diseases. According to the extrapolation after the key survey in our province from 1954 to 1955, about one million people in the province suffered from schistosomiasis; about eight million people suffered from malaria and hookworm disease; about four million people suffered from filariasis, which seriously affected the productive labor force. Many schistosomiasis epidemic areas, which were originally prosperous and thriving villages and towns, have become ruins where people are extinct and fields are deserted in just about twenty years; many villages have also become "widow villages" and "arhat villages" (referring to patients with big bellies). This is truly a tragic scene of "thousands of villages overgrown with artemisia, people have lost their homes, ten thousand households are deserted, and ghosts are singing."

In the more than nine years since liberation, thanks to the Party's deep concern for the people, especially after Chairman Mao put forward the call to "eliminate schistosomiasis within seven years" and other diseases that most seriously endanger the people's health, the work of our province in fighting diseases, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the active support of the masses, and the efforts of all medical and health workers, has achieved great results, the most prominent of which is the year 1958. Through the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, conservative ideas were criticized, the suppression of bourgeois authorities was broken through, the communist style of daring to think and act was promoted, and mass-based technical revolution and scientific research were carried out. Under the guidance of the policy of combining Chinese and Western medicine, walking on two legs with indigenous and foreign methods, many miracles were created, great achievements were obtained, and a new atmosphere was displayed.

In the eight years before 1958, a total of 200,9649 patients with schistosomiasis were treated in the province; in 1958 alone, 361,965 people were treated, and snails were eliminated on an area of more than 2.7 million mu. Among the original 41 epidemic counties and cities, four counties and cities have seen off the "God of Plague," eight counties have basically eliminated it, 22 counties and cities have completed the treatment of patients, and six counties have completed the treatment of schistosomiasis in cattle. These areas have seen a thriving and prosperous scene, and a folk ballad is circulating: "Thousands of miles of rice waves are golden yellow, and the songs of the great leap forward resound in all directions. The people in the epidemic areas have changed, and the happy days are fragrant."

In the struggle to eliminate malaria, we adopted comprehensive measures combining prevention and treatment, and universally carried out anti-relapse and systemic treatment and mosquito eradication measures. By the end of 1958, 17 counties and cities had basically eliminated malaria, and the incidence rate in the province had generally dropped to below one in a thousand. The days of "when the rice is yellow, people go to bed" are gone forever. Other diseases such as hookworm disease, filariasis, active syphilis have also reached the standard of basic elimination in many counties and cities, and kala-azar has been eradicated.

"Ghost Nest" Becomes Happy Nest

The patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene has been constantly pushed to a climax under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of November 1958, the province eliminated 53,442 kilograms of mosquito larvae; a total of 6,264,342 kilograms of flies and fly pupae; eliminated 36,166,285 rats; 18,648,531 sparrows; cleared 26,244,432 tons of garbage; dredged 18,505,212 meters of ditches; rebuilt and newly built 873,810 toilets; filled in 101,105,840 square meters of pits and potholes. The province has seen a "seven-free city"; three "four-free districts"; 173 "four-free townships"; 20 "four-free communes"; 2,294 "four-free villages"; and 327 "four-free towns." In these areas, the health campaign has been carried out in depth, and hygienic habits such as using serving chopsticks for meals, using separate toothbrushes and towels, and regular cleaning have become an important part of residents' daily life. Shashi City is a great red flag in the province. The city's residents often carry out house-moving-style cleanups; offices, households, and school dormitories have achieved "taking off shoes before entering the house"; young pioneers are often organized to stand guard and supervise on the streets, and the city no longer sees bad habits such as spitting and littering fruit peels, and the streets are clean and tidy. The Liaozhe River in the city was originally a "ghost nest" where corpses were abandoned, and the citizens had a song to describe it, "Abandoning men and women, Liaozhe River, corpses and bones in the smelly pond, weeds are many, poisonous snakes and poisonous insects, a nest of mosquitoes, a desolate scene is really hard to tell." After the patriotic health campaign, it has now become a landscaped residential area, and the masses sing again, "Now go to see Liaozhe River, there are many people coming and going, you will say and I will sing, everyone calls it a happy nest."

Going to the Mountains and Countryside, "Three Bumper Harvests"

In order to comprehensively carry out pest elimination and disease control and better train medical and health cadres and students, more than 5,000 teachers and students from various medical colleges and universities and more than 1,000 cadres from various medical and health institutions were mobilized and organized last winter to go to the epidemic areas to conduct investigations while preventing and controlling diseases. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out the working policy of "combining Chinese and Western medicine, using both indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main focus," fully mobilizing the masses, working hard and cleverly, and "starting from scratch and bare-handed" to discover folk prescriptions and secret remedies to solve the difficulties of lack of doctors and medicines in rural areas. Through big airing, big debates, big-character posters, and big debates, some incorrect ideas were clarified, the theory of conditions and skepticism were criticized, and everyone actively responded to the Party's call, happily went to the mountains and countryside, and expressed their willingness to do "three togethers" with the peasants, learn from the peasants, and consult Chinese medicine, and were willing to strive to transform themselves into red medical cadres in practice. In three months, all teachers, students, and cadres displayed the communist style of daring to think and act, showing a high sense of responsibility and revolutionary humanitarianism. For example, Gong Zhiwei and Gong Dunxun of Hubei Medical College rescued the life of the daughter of farmer Jin Shengxi, who was already prepared to be wrapped in reed mats and buried; Zhou Qinzhi and Peng Mingde, when they discovered that a sick child's phlegm was obstructing and suffocating, and was dying, sucked out the phlegm with their own mouths to save the dying child when there was no other way. Liu Zhongxiong jumped into the abyss to rescue a child who fell into the water; Lin Daoming climbed a steep rock to rescue a desperate child who fell from a rock; other heroic deeds such as rescuing from fire, sending clothes and medicines from afar are too numerous to mention. Thousands of heroes and models have emerged in the province. In addition, many effective prescriptions and secret remedies were discovered in the work, such as rice roots to treat filariasis, Smilax glabra to treat syphilis, Veratrum nigrum to treat schistosomiasis, Dichroa febrifuga to treat malaria, acupuncture to treat appendicitis, and egg inflammation to treat tetanus, etc., and technical revolutions were continuously carried out in the work to overcome the contradictions of insufficient conditions and urgent tasks. More than 100,000 effective prescriptions and secret remedies and more than 1,000 kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs were collected in the province. Although this time of going to the countryside was short, the harvest was great, improving the socialist consciousness of teachers, students, and cadres, cultivating the feelings of workers and peasants, exercising their physique, developing the good qualities of hard work, endurance, simplicity, and clarity of the Party's policy of correctness and the richness of the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine, enriching the teaching content, and everyone called it the "three bumper harvests" of thought, technology, and body.

More than a year of fighting and practice has deeply realized that the Party is wise and great, the Party's leadership is the guarantee of victory in all undertakings, and the mass line is the only reliance. Only when intellectuals sincerely obey the Party's leadership, resolutely take the socialist road, and continuously learn through work, life, and labor practice can they gradually and thoroughly transform themselves.

    卫生工作实践中的几点体会
    姚克方委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李维汉副主席关于政协的工作报告，并愿在今后工作中贯彻执行。
  一九五八年是我国在经济、政治、思想战线上取得决定胜利的一年，亦是“一年等于二十年”的大跃进的一年。这是一个不平凡的，具有深远历史意义的一年。这只有在中国共产党的领导下，政治挂了帅，充分依靠了群众，在总路线的光辉照耀下，破除了迷信，发挥了群众敢想敢做的高度积极性，战胜了种种困难，创造出无数的史无前例的奇迹。
    送走“瘟神”人康乐
    随着工农业生产大跃进，一年以来，湖北省以除害灭病为中心的卫生工作，像全国一样亦有了蓬勃的进展。
    湖北省地处长江中上游，湖泽星布，气候温暖潮湿，每年夏冬受着江汛涨落的影响，广大湖沼地区形成夏水冬陆景象，对寄生虫病媒介生物的繁殖大为有利，使寄生虫病与某些急性传染病得以流传，严重地危害和威胁着人民的健康，残害着劳动力的增长。复因国民党的长期统治，对于人民疾苦漠不关心，对于这些疾病从来没有采取任何措施进行过防治。根据我省在一九五四年至一九五五年的重点调查后的推算，全省患血吸虫病者约百万人；患疟疾和钩虫病者达八百万人左右；患丝虫病者四百万人左右，严重地影响了生产劳动力。许多血吸虫病流行地区，原是繁荣兴旺村镇，仅仅二十年左右就变成了人烟绝迹，田园荒芜的废墟了；还有不少村塆亦变成了“寡妇村”“罗汉村”了（指大肚子病人）。这真是“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”的悲惨景象。
    解放九年多来，由于党对人民的深厚关怀，尤其当毛主席提出了“七年内消灭血吸虫病”及其他危害人民健康最严重的疾病号召之后，我省与疾病作斗争的工作，在各级党委的领导、群众积极的支持和全体医药卫生干部的努力战斗下，取得了很大的战绩，突出的是一九五八年的一年。通过了整风、反右斗争，批判了保守思想，突破了资产阶级权威的压抑，发扬了敢想敢做的共产主义风格，开展了群众性的技术革命和科学研究，在中西结合，土洋并举“两条腿走路”的方针指导下，创造了不少奇迹，获得了巨大成就，展出了一幅新的气象。
    在一九五八年以前八个年头里，全省共治疗血吸虫病人二十万零九千六百四十九人；一九五八年一年就治疗了三十六万一千九百六十五人，消灭二百七十余万亩面积上的钉螺。在原流行的四十一个县市中，已经有四个县市送走了“瘟神”，八个县已达到了基本消灭，二十二个县市已治完了病人，还有六个县治完了耕牛血吸虫病。这些地区已出现了一片欣欣向荣的繁荣景象，民间流传着一首歌谣：“千里谷浪一片黄，跃进山歌响四方，疫区人民变了样，幸福的日子喷喷香”。
    在消灭疟疾斗争中，我们采取了防与治相结合的综合措施，普遍地进行了抗复发与系统治疗和灭蚊措施。到一九五八年底止已有十七个县市基本消灭了疟疾，全省发病率已普遍降低到千分之一以下。过去那种“谷子黄，人上床”的日子已一去不复返了。其他如钩虫病，丝虫病，现症梅毒，好些县市亦已达到了基本消灭的标准，黑热病已经根绝。
    “鬼窝”变成幸福窝
    以除四害讲卫生为中心的爱国卫生运动，在各级党委领导下，一浪接一浪地不断地推向高潮。据不完全统计，一九五八年截至十一月底止，全省消灭蚊虫孑孓五万三千四百四十二公斤；苍蝇蝇蛹共六百二十六万四千三百四十二公斤；消灭老鼠三千六百一十六万六千二百八十五只；麻雀一千八百六十四万八千五百三十一只；清除垃圾二千六百二十四万四千四百三十二吨；疏通沟渠一千八百五十万五千二百一十二公尺；改建与新建厕所八十七万三千八百一十个；填平坑洼一亿零一百零五万八千四百四十平方公尺。全省出现了一个七无市；三个四无区；一百七十三个四无乡；二十个四无社；二千二百九十四个四无塆；三百二十七个四无镇。在这些地区卫生运动已深入开展，卫生习惯如用公筷吃饭，分用牙刷毛巾，经常清扫洗涤，已成为居民日常生活中的一个重要组成。沙市市是全省一面大红旗，全市居民已经常执行搬家式的大扫除；机关、居户、学校寝室做到了“脱鞋进屋”；街道上经常组织少年先锋队员站岗监督，全市已不再见到随地吐痰，随地抛果屑的不良习惯，街道整洁干净。该市廖子河原是一个抛尸弃骨的“鬼窝”，市民有一首歌形容它，“抛男弃女廖子河，尸骨臭塘野草多，毒蛇毒虫蚊子窝，一片荒凉真难诉”。经过爱国卫生运动，现已成为一个园林化的居民区，群众又歌颂“如今去看廖子河，来来往往行人多，你会说来我会唱，人人称它幸福窝”。
    上山下乡“三丰收”
    为了全面性地开展除害灭病工作和更好地锻炼医药卫生干部、学生，去冬动员和组织了各医药院校师生五千余人，各医疗卫生机构干部千余人，下放到各流行地区进行边调查边防治。省委指出“中西结合，土洋并举，以土为主”的工作方针，充分发动群众，苦干巧干，要“白手起家，赤手空拳”地发掘民间验方秘方，以解决农村缺医缺药的困难。通过了大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，澄清了一些不正确的思想，批判了条件论与怀疑论，大家积极地响应党的号召，愉快地上山下乡，并在出发前表示了要与农民做好“三同”，向农民学习，向中医请教，均愿争取在实践中把自己改造成为一个红色医务干部。在三个月的时间里，全体师生干部均发挥了敢想敢做的共产主义风格，表现了高度责任心与革命人道主义。如湖北医学院龚志伟、龚敦浚抢救了已准备好芦席裹尸掩埋的农民金声喜女儿的生命；周勤智、彭明德在发现了病儿痰液梗塞窒息，垂死濒危的时候，在缺乏其他办法时，就亲口吸出痰液挽救了危亡的病儿。刘仲熊见到小孩落水，就跳入深渊抢救；林道明遇到儿童坠岩就攀登悬岩救出了绝望的孩童；其他如抢救火灾，远道送衣、送药等英雄事例不胜枚举。全省出现了成千上万的英雄模范。另外还在工作中发现很多验方秘方，如稻根治丝虫病，土伏苓治梅毒，藜芦治血吸虫病，常山治疟疾，针灸治阑尾炎，蛋炎治破伤风等等，并在工作中不断地进行了技术革命，以克服条件不足，任务紧迫的矛盾。全省搜集了十万余个验方秘方，千余种中药草。这次下放，为时虽短，但收获甚大，提高了师生干部的社会主义觉悟，培养了工农感情，锻炼了体格，养成了刻苦耐劳纯厚朴素的优良品德，明确了党的政策的正确伟大与祖国医学宝库的丰富，充实了教学内容，大家均称之为思想、技术、身体的“三丰收”。
    一年多来的战斗与实践，深切地体会到党的英明伟大，党的领导是一切事业胜利的保证，群众路线是唯一的依靠，离开了党的领导和群众的支持就会一无所成。知识分子只有真心诚意的服从党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路，通过工作、生活和劳动实践，与不断学习，才能逐步地彻底地改造自己。
