Thrift and Hard Work, Self-Reliance

    (This newspaper reports) After the Xiaopu People's Commune in Huaxian County, Henan Province, conscientiously implemented the method of unified leadership and decentralized management, the entire commune was of one mind, and a new upsurge of thrift and hard work in spring production emerged.
    In recent days, in order to guarantee the completion of the commune's plan, all the large teams and production teams have successively held a series of "housekeeping meetings," actively using their brains and relying on their own efforts to overcome difficulties in all aspects.
    In terms of purchasing small farm tools, according to preliminary calculations, the entire commune was short of more than 30,000 pieces. They widely collected lost and damaged farm tools from the past for repair. Some teams used waste iron existing in the homes of commune members and organized furnace processing, saving almost half of the more than 80,000 yuan that the commune originally planned to spend on purchasing small farm tools. Among them, the Dawuzhuang Brigade originally needed to add 25 kinds of small farm tools, totaling more than 1,000 pieces. Now, without spending a penny, they can find ways to meet their needs independently.
    Each production team also re-examined and revised its financial contract, further reducing non-production expenditures, so that the management fees of each large team and production team were reduced by 20% compared with the past.
    Some teams with relatively poor production conditions are even more motivated in production. For example, the Zhongfeng Brigade, which has the least amount of land per capita in the entire commune, has now proposed that it does not want national loans, does not ask the commune for money, and will overcome all difficulties on its own. This team did not engage in sideline occupations in the past. Now, on the premise of ensuring that 80% of the labor force is invested in agriculture, it has fully tapped the potential of labor and found 17 kinds of sideline occupations suitable for local conditions. In the two months before the wheat harvest, it can earn more than 18,000 yuan. This money can not only add some farm tools and solve the food expenses of more than 1,300 commune members in the entire team, but the remaining money is enough to pay the wages of the entire team for two months.
                                                        (Kan Feng)

    克勤克俭自力更生
    本报讯　河南省滑县小铺人民公社认真贯彻统一领导，分级管理的办法后，全社上下一心，出现了克勤克俭大搞春季生产的新高潮。
    连日来，各大队和生产队为保证公社计划的完成，都相继召开了一系列的“家务会”，积极开动脑筋，自力更生克服在各方面的困难。
    在小件农具的购置上，全社仅据初步计算，共缺三万多件，他们就广泛收集过去丢失与损坏的农具，进行修配；有的队利用社员家中现存废铁，组织烘炉加工，使这个公社原计划用八万多元添置小件农具的费用，节约了差不多一半。其中，大武庄大队原来需要添置的二十五种共一千多件小农具，现在不用花费一文钱，便能自行设法满足需要。
    各生产队还重新审查修订了各队的财务包干，进一步的压缩非生产开支，使各大队和生产队的管理费较前减少了20％。
    一些生产条件比较差的队，生产积极性更为奋发。例如全社按人平均占有土地最少的中封大队，现在全队提出了不要国家贷款，不向公社要钱，自己来克服一切困难。这个队过去没有经营副业，现在在保证以80％劳力投入农业的前提下，充分挖掘了劳动潜力，因地制宜找出了十七种副业门路，到麦收前的两个月里，可以收入一万八千多元。这些钱不但能添置一部分农具和解决全队一千三百多名社员的伙食费，剩余的钱可够发放全队两个月的工资。
