    Seize the Peach Blossom Flood Season, Quickly Transport Timber
    Hubei Completes Over 60% of Timber Felling Task
    (Our dispatch from Wuhan, April 6th) The major timber-producing areas of Hubei Province are seizing the "good water period" of the Peach Blossom Flood season – a favorable time for transporting timber – to vigorously transport timber. From March 1st to 23rd, the timber volume completed by various timber-producing areas in mountain and water transport reached over 84,000 cubic meters, more than the total volume transported in January and February. Some areas have even completed or exceeded their assigned transfer quotas ahead of schedule. This outward-bound timber has powerfully supported the production and construction of 25 key projects, including Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Hubei Steel Plant, Danjiangkou Reservoir, Beijing-Guangzhou Railway Double-Tracking, Yuanhua Coal Mine, and Jiaozuo Coal Mine.
    Hubei Province's timber production is progressing rapidly. This year's felling task has more than doubled compared to last year. To date, 62% of the annual task has been completed, with a total of over 1 million cubic meters of timber felled. In Hubei Province, 80% of timber relies on water transport. March to June is the Peach Blossom Flood season, the "golden" season for transporting timber. To seize this season and rush-transport timber, many industrial secretaries in various regions have gone deep into the front lines of logging and transportation to oversee operations. Timber-producing areas are taking various measures to quickly transport timber down the mountains and send it for water transport. Technical revolution and Red Flag emulation campaigns centered on transportation have been launched in various timber-producing areas. Workers have erected aerial cableways, built slides on mountain slopes, laid wooden rails on flat ground, and manufactured many vehicles. Various localities are promoting the highly efficient and labor-saving "herding sheep" method of floating timber downstream in the water, and universally implementing management methods that encompass contracted felling, transportation, and safety; fixed personnel, time, quantity, quality, work points, and rewards and punishments. In the Yidu Industrial Zone of Hubei Province, a key timber-producing area, the forestry area of Dangyang County, and the neighboring forestry area of Yuan'an County, successively reported good news in the first and middle ten days of March, completing the first quarter's transfer task half a month to twenty days ahead of schedule. The entire Yidu Industrial Zone also completed the transfer task ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. The Enshi Prefecture, rich in timber resources, has also greatly accelerated timber transportation recently; in mid-March, the volume of timber pushed downstream was only over 9,000 cubic meters, but in the past ten days, it has increased to 49,000 cubic meters.
    The second quarter is a crucial quarter for determining the annual task. Currently, regions that have not yet completed the transfer task are allocating manpower, gathering vehicles, and building roads, striving to complete the transfer task on time. (Attached picture)

    抓紧桃汛期  快快放木材
    湖北采伐木材任务完成百分之六十以上
    本报武汉6日电　湖北省各主要木材产区正抓紧桃汛期——运送木材的“好水期”，大力运输木材。3月1日到23日，各产材区完成山运、水运的木材达八万四千多立方公尺，比一、二两个月运出的数量还要多。有些地区并已提前、超额完成了上调任务。这些外运木材有力地支援了武钢、湖北钢厂、丹江水库、京广复线、沅华煤矿、焦作煤矿等二十五个重点工程的生产建设。
    湖北省的木材生产进度很快。今年砍伐任务比去年增加了一倍多，到目前为止，全年任务已完成了62％，共采伐木材一百多万立方公尺。湖北省的木材80％要靠水运。3月到6月正是桃汛期，是运送木材的“黄金”季节。为抓紧这个季节抢运木材，许多地区的工业书记深入到采运前线，坐阵指挥。木材产区正采取各种措施，突击将木材运下山，抢送水运。以运输为中心的技术革命和红旗竞赛已经在各木材产区开展起来。工人们在空中架设了滑丝、山坡修了滑道、平地铺上木轨、制造了许多车辆。各地正在推广效率高、节省人力的“赶羊”式的水中流送木材的方法，并普遍实行了包采伐、包运输、包安全，定员、定时、定量、定质、定工分、定奖惩的管理办法。湖北省重点产材区宜都工业区的当阳县林区，和邻近的远安县林区在3月上中旬便先后传出捷报，提前半个多月到二十天，完成了第一季度上调任务。宜都工业区全区也提前超额完成了上调任务。盛产木材的恩施专区，最近木材运输也大大加快；3月中旬时，推送下河的木材只有九千多立方公尺，近十天已增加到四万九千立方公尺。
    第二季度是决定全年任务的关键季度。目前，还没有完成上调任务的地区，正在调配人力、集结车辆、修筑道路，力争按时完成上调任务。（附图片）
