    Paying Tribute to Fang Xiaozhu
    Du Jinzhu, Beijing Tengpaiying Elementary School

    "Tears of Joy at the Harvest" written by Fang Xiaozhu is truly a good collection of poems.

    After reading this book of poems, I feel boundless sympathy and admiration for Fang Xiaozhu. Sympathy for her painful life and admiration for her courage to fight against the landlord class. This book of poems has deepened my understanding of how vicious the landlords were, those heartless people who cruelly exploited the peasants for their own comfortable lives. How bitter was the peasants' life? For the sake of survival, Fang Xiaozhu had to graze sheep for the landlord at the age of only twelve. She suffered all kinds of abuse from the landlord, but she did not yield, and she hated that dark society and the landlords even more. Fang Xiaozhu joined the revolutionary work at the age of fourteen, and precisely because she relentlessly attacked and satirized the people's enemies, the enemies hated her even more. She was murdered by the vicious landlord when she was leading a land reform movement in a village.

    Although Fang Xiaozhu is dead, her spirit lives on forever.

    When we read this collection of poems today, we will think even more about how hard-won our current happiness is! We should commemorate the deceased with practical actions, study hard, and build our motherland into a better place in the future!

    向方小珠致敬
    北京藤牌营小学　杜金柱
    方小珠写的“丰收泪满眶”真是一本好诗。
    读完了这本诗以后，我对方小珠无限同情和敬佩。同情她的痛苦生活，敬佩她勇敢地和地主阶级作斗争。这本诗歌，使我又深一步了解地主是多么凶恶，他们那些没有心肝的人，为了他们自己生活舒服，残酷地剥削农民。农民生活苦到什么样呢？为了生活仅有十二岁的方小珠就得给地主去放羊。受尽了地主的虐待，但她没有屈服，她更恨那个黑暗的社会和地主了。十四岁的方小珠参加了革命工作，正是因为她无情地打击和讽刺人民的仇人，敌人更加恨她，在她领导某庄闹土地改革的时候，她被凶毒的地主杀害了。
    方小珠虽然死了，但她的精神是永远活着的。
    我们今天来读这本诗集，就更会想到：我们现在的幸福，来得多么不容易呀！我们应该用实际行动来纪念死者，好好学习，将来把我们的祖国建设得更美好！
