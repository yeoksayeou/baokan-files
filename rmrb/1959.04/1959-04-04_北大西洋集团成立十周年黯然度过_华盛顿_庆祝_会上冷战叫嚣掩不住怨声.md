Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd, Washington dispatch: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization began its council meeting in Washington on the 2nd to "celebrate" the tenth anniversary of this aggressive military bloc.

    U.S. President Eisenhower and Acting Secretary of State Herter, in their speeches, tried their best to tout the "achievements" of this group over the past decade and wanted other member states to believe that the United States still possesses a "position of strength" today. They demanded that member states possess "unwavering" "courage" to continue following the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war, and to make "necessary sacrifices" for this. They especially called on member states to maintain "unity," believing that this was "vital" to the life of the North Atlantic Group.

    The keynote of Eisenhower and Herter reflects the fact that, under the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the bankruptcy of the U.S. "position of strength" has caused a deep "crisis of confidence" in the United States among the member states of this group. At present, the internal quarrels and contradictions among the member states of this military group have become increasingly apparent. Just before the opening of this meeting, French President De Gaulle, who had long been clamoring for sharing the "leadership" of the Western world without being heeded, announced that he would retain command of the French Mediterranean Fleet in wartime. Former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of the North Atlantic Group, British Field Marshal Montgomery, once again publicly attacked the U.S. monopoly in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    In a speech at a closed-door meeting, Herter, while demanding that member states continue to expand their armaments, boasted about the military strength of the United States to cover up the fact that the United States is currently lagging behind the Soviet Union in the development of missiles. He said that in "necessary times" the United States would use all its aircraft and missile power to "defend" its allies in the Atlantic Treaty. Herter harped on the worn-out tune of the so-called Soviet "threat." He said that the "aggressive challenge" facing the West today is "the same" as it was ten years ago, and even "more insidious" than it was ten years ago. He continued to advocate the "policy of strength," saying that "military strength and the courage to use such strength when necessary" are "indispensable conditions" for this military group to "make further progress."

    The chairman of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, Dutch Foreign Minister Luns, while trying his best to "promote" the Cold War policy, talked about the deep crisis of the policies pursued by this aggressive group. Luns admitted that the peaceful diplomacy pursued by the Soviet Union has had an "impact" on Western public opinion. He said that there is a "weariness" in the Western public. He called it "defeatism."

    Referring to the relations between the North Atlantic Treaty countries, Luns complained that "our Atlantic unity should not be limited to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization region, but should also be reflected in the problems in other parts of the world." He also said, "We people on this side of the Atlantic feel entitled to be more fully informed and supported in trying to solve problems outside our Europe." Luns's words reflect the growing dissatisfaction of the Western European member states of the North Atlantic Group with the United States' increasing seizure of their colonial interests in Asia and Africa, and their desire to use the power of this group more to consolidate their colonial interests.

    The extremely pro-American Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Group, Spaak, clamored at the meeting about the so-called "large-scale political offensive by the Soviet Union." He said: "We cannot afford to relax our efforts; on the contrary, the environment requires us to be more vigilant than before." He also asked the member states to "partially depart from (that kind of) policy of only taking care of oneself."

    In view of the strong pressure from Western public opinion to change the "Cold War" policy, Eisenhower, Herter, and Spaak, while advocating the continuation of the "Cold War," had to make some expressions of willingness to negotiate with the Soviet Union. (Attached picture)

### 北大西洋集团成立十周年黯然度过  华盛顿“庆祝”会上冷战叫嚣掩不住怨声

    北大西洋集团成立十周年黯然度过
    华盛顿“庆祝”会上冷战叫嚣掩不住怨声
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：北大西洋公约组织2日开始在华盛顿举行理事会会议，“庆祝”这个侵略性军事集团成立十周年。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔，代理国务卿赫脱在演说中竭力鼓吹这个集团十年来“取得的成就”，并且要其他成员国相信美国在今天仍然拥有“实力地位”。他们要求成员国具有“坚持不渝”的“勇气”，继续追随美国扩军备战，并且为此而作出“必需的牺牲”。他们特别呼吁成员国保持“团结”，认为这同北大西洋集团的“生命攸关”。
    艾森豪威尔和赫脱的这种主调反映出，在东风压倒西风的形势下，美国“实力地位”的破产，已经使得这个集团成员国对美国产生了深重的“信心危机”。在目前，这个军事集团成员国内部的争吵和矛盾已日益表面化。就在这次会议开幕前不久，长久以来吵着要求分享西方世界“领导权”而未得到理睬的法国总统戴高乐宣布将在战时保留法国地中海舰队的指挥权，前北大西洋集团盟军最高副司令、英国元帅蒙哥马利又一次公开攻击美国在北大西洋公约组织的垄断地位。
    赫脱在秘密会议上发言要求成员国继续扩军时，吹嘘美国的军事力量，掩饰美国目前在发展导弹方面落后于苏联的事实。他说，在“必要的时候”美国将用它的全部飞机和导弹力量来“保卫”它的大西洋公约中的盟国。赫脱大弹所谓苏联“威胁”的滥调。他说，西方今天面临的“侵略性挑战”是和十年前“一样的”，甚至比十年前“更阴险”。他继续鼓吹“实力政策”说，“军事力量以及和必要时使用这种力量的勇气”是这个军事集团“进一步取得进展”的“必不可少的条件”。
    北大西洋公约组织理事会主席、荷兰外交大臣伦斯在发言时一方面竭力“鼓吹”冷战政策，另一方面却谈到了这个侵略集团所奉行的政策的深刻危机。伦斯承认，苏联所推行的和平外交对西方的公众舆论是有“影响”的。他说，西方公众存在着一种“厌倦”的心理。他把它叫做“失败主义”。
    在谈到北大西洋公约国家之间的关系的时候，伦斯抱怨说，“我们大西洋的团结不应当仅限于北大西洋公约组织地区，还应当体现在世界其他地区的问题上”。他又说，“我们在大西洋这一边的人们感到在设法解决我们的欧洲以外的问题方面，有权利获得更充分的了解和支持。”伦斯的话反映了北大西洋集团中西欧成员国对美国在亚非攫取它们的殖民利益越来越大的不满，以及它们希望更多运用这个集团的力量巩固其殖民利益的要求。
    极端亲美的北大西洋集团秘书长斯巴克在会上叫嚷所谓西方面临“苏联大规模的政治攻势”。他说：“我们经不起放松努力，相反，环境要求我们比以前更警惕”。他还要求各成员国“部分地离开（那种）只管自己的政策”。
    鉴于西方舆论要求改变“冷战”政策的压力十分强烈，艾森豪威尔、赫脱和斯巴克在鼓吹继续进行“冷战”的同时，也不得不作出一些愿意同苏联进行谈判的表示。（附图片）
