Wheat Ripens on Both Banks of the Hong River
Farmers of All Ethnic Groups Busy with Harvest

    Kunming, April 16th (From Our Newspaper) – Over 400,000 mu of wheat in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province have begun to be harvested. According to investigations and estimations, the average yield per mu has reached 200 jin, an increase of approximately four times compared to last year, with the total output expected to increase sevenfold. This year’s wheat harvest on both banks of the Hong River is unprecedented. During a 400-li journey, the reporter witnessed waves of wheat rolling in the thousands of terraced fields on the Ailao Mountains, where clouds brushed the peaks, and the early rice paddies, already turning green, woven into a magnificent tapestry of the frontier landscape.

    For the first time, women from the Hani, Miao, Yi, and more than ten other ethnic groups are harvesting wheat. Ethnic minority families with the tradition of "tasting the new grain" gathered joyfully around bamboo tables, their faces beaming as they sampled the new harvest. In Mile County, known throughout the country for the Yi ethnic group’s “Axi Jumping Moon” dance, the average yield per mu of 160,000 mu of wheat has exceeded 300 jin. This is a great encouragement for ethnic minorities in high-altitude, impoverished mountainous areas. Hani farmers in Jinping, Yuanyang, Honghe and other counties along the Hong River achieved a yield of 400 jin per mu in their first wheat planting. Even in Hekou and Pingbian, the lowest altitude areas of the Yunnan Plateau, the wheat grew very well.

    The Ailao Mountains rise and fall within the Autonomous Prefecture, with a subtropical climate and a frost period of generally only about fifteen days, and some areas are frost-free year-round, allowing for wheat cultivation in all four seasons. In Northeast China, wheat requires a growth period of more than 300 days, while here it only needs 80 days in some cases.

    Most areas here do not have the habit of planting wheat, and individual areas have grown wheat before, but due to extensive cultivation, the yield was extremely low. Last winter, the Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee implemented the Provincial Party Committee's instruction of "a great revolution in the spring crop" and decided to vigorously develop wheat production. Beginning in October last year, hundreds of thousands of farmers across the state invested in wheat production. With soaring enthusiasm, they comprehensively implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, deep plowing the land to a depth of five inches to one foot in general, applying approximately 10,000 jin of dry fertilizer per mu, using improved varieties, and meticulously managing the fields.

    Currently, on hundreds of wheat threshing grounds throughout the state, threshing machines are spinning non-stop, and grains of wheat are flowing like streams.

### 红河两岸小麦黄  各族农民收割忙

　　红河两岸小麦黄
　　各族农民收割忙
    本报昆明16日电　云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州四十多万亩小麦开镰收割。经调查估计，每亩平均产量达到两百斤，比去年提高四倍左右，总产量将增加七倍。红河两岸今年小麦的丰收是空前的。记者行程四百里，但见云雾摩顶而过的哀牢山脉成百上千台梯田里麦浪翻滚，和平坝里已返青的早稻水田编织成锦绣的边疆山河图。
    哈尼族、苗族、彝族等十多种民族妇女生平第一次收割小麦。有着丰收“尝新谷”习惯的少数民族人家，合家欢聚在竹制餐桌旁，笑逐颜开地尝新。以“阿细跳月”歌舞著名全国的彝族聚居的弥勒县，今年十六万亩小麦，平均亩产三百斤以上，这对于高寒贫瘠山区少数民族是莫大的鼓舞；红河沿岸金平、元阳、红河等县哈尼族农民，第一次种小麦就获得亩产四百斤的成就，连云南高原海拔最低的河口、屏边等地，小麦生长也很好。
    自治州境内哀牢山脉起伏，气候属亚热带，霜期一般只有十五天左右，有的终年无霜，一年四季可以种小麦。在东北，小麦生长期要三百多天，而这里短的只要八十天。
    这里多数地区没有种麦的习惯，个别地区也种过小麦，但由于耕作粗放，产量极低。去年冬天，自治州党委贯彻执行省委“小春大革命”的指示，才决定大力发展小麦生产。从去年10月开始，全州数十万农民投入了种麦生产，他们以冲天干劲，全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，一般土地都深耕五寸到一尺，每亩施干肥一万斤左右，采用了良种，田间管理也很细致。
    目前，全州成百上千的麦场上，打谷机不停地旋转，麦粒似流。
