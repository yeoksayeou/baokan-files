    Vigorously Manufacture High-Efficiency Farm Tools
    Guizhou Strengthens Technical and Organizational Leadership at All Levels
    (Our newspaper, Guiyang, 5th dispatch) Guizhou Province, in the current movement to vigorously reform tools and rush to manufacture various tools for spring plowing and summer harvesting, the Provincial Tool Reform Committee gathered new tools created throughout the province and some from other provinces in the suburbs of Guiyang for on-site testing and evaluation. It assessed and finalized some high-efficiency tools suitable for mountainous areas, and recommended them to various parts of the province, promoting the current tool reform movement to achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    This on-site testing and evaluation has selected twelve better tools, including plows and harrows, from the more than fifty tools sent from various places. In addition to being suitable for the characteristics of mountainous areas, these tools also have the characteristics of simple structure, easy to obtain materials and manufacture, convenient operation, high efficiency, and low price. For example, the chicken-beak plow manufactured by the People's Commune in Zunyi South can plow one to two mu of paddy fields per person and ox per day, with a depth of more than eight inches. The shape of this plow is similar to that of the old-fashioned plow, and farmers who can use the old-fashioned plow can use it without learning. The soil pulverizer created by the Dongfanghong People's Commune in Tongzi County can pulverize 25 mu of soil per person and ox per day, increasing efficiency by about 50 times compared to manual soil pulverization.
    Through on-site evaluation and finalization, the province has formulated a preliminary plan for the creation and promotion of new tools based on the situation of insufficient labor. Within this year, more than 8.62 million pieces of high-efficiency tools such as rope-traction machines, deep plows, soil pulverizers, seeders, and rice transplanters are to be manufactured. In particular, agricultural tools for spring planting and summer harvesting must be manufactured in large quantities, and efforts should be made to mechanize plowing tools for deep plowing, mechanize rice transplanting, and mechanize rice and wheat harvesting.
    In order to realize this plan, training classes were held at the same time as the on-site evaluation and testing, and one or two carpenters and blacksmiths were drawn from each county to learn the manufacture and use of various high-efficiency tools. In addition, counties and people's communes should establish tool reform offices, and production teams and management areas should establish reform groups, with special personnel responsible for regular inspection and supervision.

    大造高工效农具
    贵州层层加强技术和组织领导
    本报贵阳5日电　贵州省在当前大搞工具改革，大力赶制春耕、夏收等各种工具的运动中，省工具改革委员会把全省和一部分外省创造出来的新工具，聚集在贵阳市郊，进行了现场试验和评比，对一些适合山区特点的高工效工具作了评定和定型，并向全省各地推荐，促使当前的工具改革运动达到多快好省的要求。
    这次现场试验评比，已从各地送来的五十多种工具中，选出了犁、耙等十二种较好的工具。这些工具除了能适合山区的特点外，还具有结构简单、取材制造容易、操作方便、工效高和价格低等特点。如遵义南的人民公社制造的鸡咀犁，每天一人一牛能犁板田一至二亩，深度达八寸以上。这种犁的形状和旧式犁相似，能使用旧式犁的农民，不学都能使用。桐梓县东方红人民公社创造的碎土机，每天一人一牛能碎土二十五亩，比手工碎土提高工效五十倍左右。
    通过现场评定和定型，全省根据劳力不足的情况，订出了新工具的创造、推广初步规划。在今年内，要制造出绳索牵引机、深耕犁、碎土机、播种机、插秧机等高工效工具八百六十二万多件，特别是春耕播种和夏收的农具，要大量制造，尽量做到耕地工具深耕化、插秧机化、稻麦收割机化。
    为了实现这个计划，在现场评比试验的同时，举办了训练班，从各县抽调一至二名木、铁匠学习各种高工效工具的制造和使用。另外，县、人民公社要建立工具改革办公室，生产队和管理区要建立改革小组，设专人负责，进行定期检查和督促。　（贺永丰）
