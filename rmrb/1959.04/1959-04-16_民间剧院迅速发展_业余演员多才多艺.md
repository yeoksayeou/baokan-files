　　Rapid Development of People's Theaters
　　Amateur Actors Are Versatile

　　In some towns and villages of the Soviet Union, a new type of artistic flower has recently sprung up—the "People's Theater." As soon as it appeared, it developed like bamboo shoots after a rain, and currently there are about a hundred of them in the Russian Republic alone.

　　The "People's Theater" is an amateur theater that has grown out of amateur drama groups. Its actors are workers, farmers, and housewives. These ordinary laborers from factories and collective farms boldly declare that they want to join the ranks of art performance experts, so it is no wonder that the Soviet people regard it as a gratifying phenomenon in cultural life.

　　The "People's Theater" has enlivened the cultural life of local residents. Take the Besonovka Village's theater in the Pinsk Oblast as an example. It was only established a few months ago, but each of its performances has been a great success, and the whole village looks forward to its performances as if celebrating a festival. The actors of the "People's Theater" are very enthusiastic about creation. Some theaters put on five plays a month! Like the "People's Theater" in Voskresensk District, Gorky Oblast, and the "People's Theater" of the Berev Village Collective Farm in Tula Oblast, because the original drama groups had a relatively long history, they are now staging famous plays from ancient and modern times. Their repertoire includes works by famous writers such as Ostrovsky, Gorky, Ivanov, and Lavrenev.

　　The actors of the "People's Theater" come from all walks of life, and at the same time, they do all kinds of work in the theater. The leader of the "People's Theater" in Berev Village said: "There are a total of sixty people in our theater, and we do everything ourselves. After rehearsing, we make our own props, and we also paint the sets ourselves. Among our actors, electrician Geshinko, driver Puchkov, typist Silova, and housewife Zarukova all perform very well."

　　The Ministry of Culture of the Russian Republic is preparing to select a group of outstanding actors from these "People's Theaters" to form local state-owned troupes.

    民间剧院迅速发展
    业余演员多才多艺
    在苏联的一些城镇和村庄里，最近涌现出一枝新型的艺术花朵——“民间剧院”。它一出现就像雨后春笋似地发展起来，目前仅俄罗斯共和国就有一百个左右了。
    “民间剧院”是在业余剧团的基础上成长起来的业余剧院，它的演员是工人、农民和家庭主妇。这些来自工厂和农庄的普通劳动者们，大胆地宣称他们要跻身于艺术表演专家的行列，无怪乎苏联人民把它看作是文化生活中一种可喜的现象了。
      “民间剧院”活跃了当地居民的文化生活。就拿平兹州别索诺夫卡村的刷院来说吧，它成立不过几个月，但是它的每一次演出都得到很大的成功，全村像过节一样地期待它的演出。“民间剧院”的演员们创作热情都很高，有的剧院一个月就上演了五个戏！像高尔基州沃斯克列先斯克区“民间剧院”和图拉州别列夫村集体农庄的“民间剧院”，因为原先的戏剧小组有比较悠久的历史，所以如今他们上演的都是古今名剧。他们的剧目中包括有奥斯特洛夫斯基、高尔基、伊万诺夫和拉夫列?夫等名家的作品。
      “民间剧院”的演员来自各行各业，同时他们在剧院中也是各种工作都作。别列夫村“民间剧院”的领导人说：“我们剧院共有六十人，什么都是我们亲自动手干。排演完了，我们就自己做小道具，布景也是我们自己画。在我们的演员中，电站工人皆辛科、汽车司机普奇科夫、打字员西洛娃和家庭主妇札鲁科娃，表演的都很出色。”
    俄罗斯共和国文化部正准备从这些“民间剧院”中选拔一批演技优秀演员组成地方公营剧团。
