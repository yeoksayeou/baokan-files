　　Widely Implement the Contract System
    The contract system is an important means for the state to implement planned leadership over the people's communes and promote production development. The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "In order to ensure the realization of exchange plans, the contract system should be widely implemented between the state and the commune, and between communes."
    The contract system is not unfamiliar to us. Long before the establishment of the people's communes, the contract system had been promoted in many areas. In recent years, the pre-purchase contracts for several major cash crops signed by the state with farmers, as well as the contracts signed between supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups, have played a positive role in encouraging and guiding the broad masses of farmers to plant cash crops according to the state plan, ensuring that the state completes the task of agricultural product procurement, and promoting the development of the cooperative movement. However, before the people's commune movement, the implementation of the contract system was not widespread enough, and only a few varieties were included in the contracts, and most of them were single purchase contracts or supply contracts. The universal establishment of people's communes in the vast rural areas of our country has greatly promoted the further development of productive forces. Because the people's commune is a comprehensive large-scale organization, its diverse tasks require it to have a higher degree of planning and organization. Its production scale is getting larger and larger, and the categories of collective operations are also increasing. Many scattered products that were freely produced and sold in the past must now be gradually transformed into organized production and organized sales. Therefore, the production of the commune must be arranged in a more planned and unified way in order to meet the needs of the new situation. And the widespread implementation of the contract system will be conducive to the people's communes arranging production in a planned way.
    All economic construction undertakings in our country should be planned and arranged in a unified manner according to the principle of proportionate development. The entire national economy must reflect the spirit of the whole country acting as a single chess game, and fully leverage the enthusiasm of all aspects of the national economy under the centralized and unified leadership of the state. The people's commune is an important component of our national economy. Due to different resources and conditions in various regions (such as the south and the north, mountainous areas and plains), their production, consumption, sales, labor force, capital, and other conditions are also different. In this case, what the commune can produce, what it sells to the state, how much it sells; what it needs the state to supply, how much it supplies, as well as product quality, delivery time, etc., all need to be arranged in a planned way according to the principle of unified leadership and decentralized management, and according to various specific local conditions. With a contract as a basis, stipulating the contents of production, sales, and supply in the contract, the people's commune will have a clear understanding, and production will have a clear direction, so that it can carry out production boldly according to the needs of the state and the commune. By signing contracts, not only is the planning of the people's commune's production strengthened, but it will also inevitably promote the continuous development of commune production. For example, the original diversified management plan formulated by the Hongzhuan People's Commune in Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, only included fifteen varieties such as bamboo and charcoal. After signing the contract, re-tapping potential and finding new ways, it quickly expanded to sixty-one products. This year, the commune's jute production also re-formulated a plan according to the requirements of the state, expanding from the original 500 mu to 1,200 mu. By signing contracts, the people's communes can be further guaranteed in terms of material supply, and they can also get better help from the state and commercial departments in terms of technical guidance. After the commercial departments of Longchang County, Sichuan Province, signed contracts with the communes in the county at the beginning of this year, they have supplied the communes with 200 boxes of improved bee breeds, more than 330,000 various tree saplings, and 750,000 jin of oil crop seeds according to the contract, and helped the communes train more than 480 technicians. It is not difficult to see that the contract system can not only strengthen planning and incorporate commune plans into the state plan, but also enable the commune to leverage its enthusiasm in accordance with local conditions, thereby greatly promoting the development of the commune's self-sufficiency production and commodity production.
    The contract system is also an important auxiliary means to strengthen the planning of the national economy. Our national economy is a complex organism, which includes both industry and agriculture; it includes both the production of many major products and the production of various small products. The state can implement direct planned management for enterprises under ownership by the whole people, but cannot fully implement direct planned management for enterprises under collective ownership. Major products can be included in the state plan, but it is difficult to include all the small products with a wide variety in the state plan. This requires some auxiliary methods to supplement the state plan. The widespread and systematic implementation of the contract system is an important and effective way to assist the state plan. Many facts prove that for the production of some products that are not included in the state plan, according to the needs of the state and the commune, fixing them in the form of contracts according to local conditions can not only make the state's planned leadership more comprehensive, but also more specific. The Longshi Supply and Marketing Department of Longchang County, Sichuan, through signing contracts with the commune, also scheduled the production of some small and scattered products needed by the market. In less than two months, it purchased hundreds of thousands of small products such as brooms and bamboo hats, which not only expanded production, but also met the needs of market supply. It is not difficult to see that the auxiliary role of the contract system for the state plan is very obvious.
    Of course, the role of the contract system is not limited to this. With the widespread implementation of the contract system in rural areas of our country, the relationship between urban and rural areas, between agriculture and commerce, between communes and communes, and between production teams and production teams will inevitably become more closely integrated. It is not only conducive to strengthening cooperation between departments and consolidating the people's communes, but also conducive to further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The widespread implementation of the contract system has important economic significance and important political significance.
    Party committees at all levels taking political command, strengthening leadership, and strengthening political and ideological work for the broad masses of grassroots cadres and commune members are important prerequisites for the smooth implementation of the contract system. If political and ideological work is done deeply and thoroughly, coupled with proper economic work arrangements, the masses will consciously and voluntarily implement the contract. On the contrary, if ideological and political work is neglected, the implementation of the contract system will encounter difficulties, or even if it is signed, it will be difficult to implement. In the process of signing contracts with the communes, production departments and financial and trade departments at all levels should, on the basis of strengthening political and ideological education, start from organizing commune production in the spirit of the whole country acting as a single chess game, mobilize the broad masses to participate in production planning, and implement the tasks stipulated in the contract at all levels, all the way down to the production team (for many commodities, the commercial departments can also sign contracts directly with the production team), so that everyone has a struggle goal and everyone has a clear direction. In this way, the implementation of the contract will have a mass base, making the realization of the contract the most reliable guarantee.
    Once a contract is signed, neither party can arbitrarily change it under normal circumstances. Both parties signing the contract must work together to ensure the realization of the contract. At the same time, the contract should also have a certain degree of flexibility. Because everything is constantly developing, there are always some special circumstances that are difficult to foresee when the contract is signed. Therefore, when the situation changes, it is still necessary to make appropriate modifications to certain parts of the contract to make it closer to reality or in line with reality, which is fundamentally different from arbitrarily changing the contract. In short, the seriousness of the contract does not exclude flexibility, and the two are a unity of opposites. Any one-sided understanding of seriousness and flexibility is incorrect.
    In the long period to come, the contract system will be an important form of combination between the state and the commune. The widespread and comprehensive implementation of the contract system will have a positive impact on the development of the national economy. It is foreseeable that various regions will inevitably solve some new problems and constantly create new experiences in the process of promoting the contract system. Party committees and commercial departments at all levels should promptly discover problems, summarize experiences, and improve them in order to better strive for the implementation of the central government's instructions on the widespread implementation of the contract system.

### 广泛地实行合同制度

　　广泛地实行合同制度
    合同制度是国家对人民公社实行计划领导、促进生产发展的一种重要的手段。党的六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中曾经指出：“为了保证交换计划的实现，要在国家和公社之间、公社和公社之间，广泛地实行合同制度。”
    合同制度对我们来说，并不是陌生的。早在人民公社成立以前，合同制度就在不少地区推行过。几年来，国家同农民订立的若干主要经济作物的预购合同，以及供销社同农业社、互助组之间订立的合同，对于鼓励和指导广大农民根据国家计划种植经济作物，保证国家完成农产品收购任务，对于促进合作化运动的发展，都起过一定的良好作用。但是，在人民公社化运动以前，合同制的推行还是不够普遍的，纳入合同的也只限于少数品种，并且多数是单一的收购合同或供应合同。人民公社在我国广大农村的普遍建立，大大地推动了生产力的进一步发展。由于人民公社是一个综合性的大型组织，多样性的工作，要求它具有更高的计划性和组织性。它的生产规模越来越大，集体经营的门类也越来越多。许多过去自由生产和自由出售的零星产品，现在也要逐步变为有组织地生产和有组织地出售了。因此，公社的生产必须更有计划地统一安排，才能适应新形势的需要。而广泛地实行合同制度将有利于人民公社有计划地安排生产。
    我国各项经济建设事业，都应当根据有计划按比例发展的原则来统筹安排。整个国民经济必须体现全国一盘棋的精神，在国家集中统一领导下充分发挥国民经济各方面的积极性。人民公社是我国国民经济的一个重要组成部分，由于各地区资源和条件不同（如南方和北方、山区和平原），它们的生产、消费、销售、劳动力、资金等情况也就各有不同。在这种情况下，公社自己能够生产什么，向国家出售什么，出售多少；需要国家供应什么，供应多少，以及产品质量、交货时间等等，都需要根据统一领导、分级管理的原则，和根据当地各种具体情况有计划地进行安排。有了合同为依据，把生产、出售、供应等内容在合同中规定下来，这样，人民公社就有了底，生产就有了明确方向，就可以按照国家和公社的需要放手地进行生产。通过签订合同，不仅加强了人民公社生产的计划性，而且也必然推动公社生产不断发展。例如福建省建瓯县红专人民公社原来制定的多种经营计划，只有毛竹、柴炭等十五种，经过签订合同，重新挖潜力、找门路，就迅速扩大到六十一种产品。这个公社今年黄麻的生产也根据国家的要求，重新制定计划，由原来的五百亩扩大到一千二百亩。通过签订合同，人民公社在物资供应方面可以进一步得到保证，在技术指导方面也可以得到国家和商业部门更好的帮助。四川省隆昌县商业部门在今年年初和全县各人民公社签订合同以后，已经按照合同规定供应了公社良种蜜蜂二百箱、各种树苗三十三万多株、油料作物种子七十五万斤，并帮助各公社训练了技术员四百八十多人。这就不难看出，合同制度既可以加强计划性，把公社计划纳入国家计划；又可以使公社因地制宜地发挥积极性，从而大大地促进公社自给性生产和商品性生产的发展。
    合同制度还是加强国民经济计划性的重要辅助手段。我国国民经济是一个复杂的有机体，它既包括工业，又包括农业；既包括许多大宗的主要产品的生产，又包括各种各样的小宗产品的生产。国家对于全民所有制的企业可以实行直接的计划管理，对于集体所有制的企业，就不能完全实行直接的计划管理，对于大宗的主要产品可以编列在国家计划之内，对于品种繁多的小宗产品就很难都编列在国家计划以内。这就需要一些辅助的办法来补充国家计划。广泛地、系统地实行合同制度，正是辅助国家计划的一个重要的、行之有效的办法。许多事实证明，对于若干没有列入国家计划之内的产品的生产，根据国家和公社的需要，因地制宜地通过合同形式固定下来，不但可以使国家的计划领导更加全面化，而且更加具体化了。四川隆昌县的龙市供销部通过与公社订立合同，把一些市场需要的小宗零星产品的生产也排上了队，在不到两个月的时间内就收购了几十万把扫把、斗笠等小宗产品，既扩大了生产，也满足了市场供应的需要。这就不难看出，合同制对于国家计划的辅助作用是十分明显的。
    合同制的作用当然还不止于此。随着合同制在我国农村广泛地实行，必将使得城乡之间、农业和商业之间、公社和公社以及生产队和生产队之间的关系更加紧密地结合起来。它不仅有利于加强部门之间的协作，有利于人民公社的巩固，而且有利于进一步巩固工农联盟。广泛地实行合同制度，既具有重要的经济意义，又具有重要的政治意义。
    各级党委政治挂帅、加强领导，加强对广大基层干部社员群众的政治思想工作，是顺利推行合同制度的重要前提。政治思想工作做得深、做得透，加上经济工作安排得妥善，群众就会自觉自愿地执行合同。相反的，忽视思想政治工作，合同制的推行就会遇到困难，或者签订了，也难以实行。各级生产部门和财贸部门在同公社签订合同的过程中应该在加强政治思想教育工作的基础上，根据全国一盘棋的精神，从组织公社生产入手发动广大群众参与生产规划，并把合同中规定的任务层层落实，一直落实到生产队（许多商品还可以由商业部门直接同生产队签订合同），使人人有奋斗目标，个个方向明确。这样，合同的执行，就有了群众基础，使合同的实现有了最可靠的保证。
    合同一经签订，任何一方在一般情况下都不能随意变更。签订合同的双方必须为保证合同的实现共同努力。同时合同又应当具有一定的灵活性。因为任何事物都在不断地发展，总有些特殊情况是订立合同时难以预料得到的，因之，在情况发生变化的时候，对合同的某些部分作适当的修改，使它更加接近实际或符合实际，还是必要的，这和随意变动合同是根本不同的。总之，合同的严肃性并不排斥灵活性，两者是对立的统一。对严肃性和灵活性作任何片面的理解都是不正确的。
    合同制度在今后的长时期中，将是国家同公社之间结合的一种重要形式。广泛地、全面地推行合同制度，将对国民经济的发展产生良好的影响。可以预料，各地在推行合同制度的过程中必然会不断地解决一些新的问题，不断地创造新的经验。各级党委和商业部门应当及时发现问题，总结经验，加以提高，以便更好地为贯彻执行中央关于广泛实行合同制度的指示而奋斗。
