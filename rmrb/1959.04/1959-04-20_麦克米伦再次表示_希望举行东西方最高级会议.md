Xinhua News Agency, London, 19th: British Prime Minister Macmillan, speaking at a Conservative Party Young Members' Conference on the 18th, once again expressed his hope that the East and West would agree to hold a summit conference. He said, "Such a conference should not be seen as the only effort to solve all problems, but as the beginning of a series of efforts that can gradually eliminate some difficulties."

Macmillan stated that Britain is willing to "achieve peace through negotiation and reasonable agreements," but he also said that the so-called "appeasement path" must never be followed.

Macmillan said, "The next stage of international negotiations will be complex, perhaps protracted. The West will soon have to agree on a common approach to the thorny negotiations before us."

　　麦克米伦再次表示
　　希望举行东西方最高级会议
    新华社19日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相麦克米伦18日在保守党青年党员大会上讲话时再一次表示希望东西方会同意举行最高级会议。他说，“不应当把这种会议看成是解决所有问题的仅有的一次努力，而应当看成是可以逐步消除一些困难的一系列努力的开始。”
    麦克米伦表示英国愿意“通过谈判和合理的协议来实现和平”，但是，他又说，决不能遵循所谓“姑息的道路”。
    麦克米伦说，“今后一个阶段的国际谈判将是复杂的，也许是旷日持久的。西方不久就要就摆在我们面前的棘手的谈判取得一致的态度。”
