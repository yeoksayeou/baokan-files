Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 25th: People from all walks of life in Wuhan have been holding symposiums or writing letters to newspapers, angrily condemning the words and deeds of imperialists and Indian expansionists in supporting Tibetan rebels and interfering in China's internal affairs. They unanimously pointed out that any conspiracy to meddle in China's territory of Tibet will be resolutely countered by the entire Chinese people.

    The Wuhan Buddhist Association wrote to the "Yangtze Daily" stating that Tibet has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists to interfere in China's internal affairs and attempt to split our country's unity will inevitably be thoroughly bankrupt. The letter also expressed firm support for the wise measures proposed by Premier Zhou in the government work report regarding thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion and promoting the new life of the Tibetan people.

    Over the past few days, more than 140 monks and nuns from the Guiyuan Temple and other temples in the Hanyang district have held four consecutive symposiums at the Guiyuan Temple. Many people spoke at the meetings, pointing out that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" is a document filled with lies. They said that since liberation, the Party and the government have renovated major temples throughout the country and provided many benefits to the monks and nuns. Our Guiyuan Temple has been renovated several times. The so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" slanders the People's Liberation Army for "destroying many temples and killing many lamas," etc., which is complete nonsense and has no basis whatsoever.

    Catholic priests and parishioners in Wuhan also held a symposium. Dong Guangqing, Archbishop of the Hankou Archdiocese, said at the symposium: After reading the lie-filled so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," I was very angry. Yuan Wenhua, chairman of the Wuhan Patriotic Catholic Association and Bishop of the Wuchang Diocese, said: The content and tone of this so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" do not seem to have been written by the Dalai Lama himself, but rather imposed on him by others.

    The broad masses of workers from the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, Qingshan Thermal Power Plant, Yuhua Textile Mill, Hankou Port, and Wuhan Cultural Goods Station unanimously stated in their discussions that they would take practical actions to counter the conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists to interfere in China's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th: People from all walks of life in Guangzhou are extremely indignant at the acts of imperialists and Indian expansionists in interfering in China's internal affairs.

    These days, when newspapers carrying speeches by representatives of the National People's Congress condemning imperialists and Indian expansionists were delivered to various factories, rural areas in the suburbs, and schools, people rushed to read them. After reading the newspapers, many people wrote letters to the newspapers or posted big-character posters, and some even held symposiums to angrily condemn the words and deeds of imperialists and Indian expansionists in interfering in China's internal affairs. The entire staff of the Xidi Department Store in the city wrote to the "Guangzhou Daily" saying: We unanimously support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report at the National People's Congress meeting and the speeches of the representatives of the National People's Congress. We want to warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists: the 600 million Chinese people are not to be bullied. Many students at Sun Yat-sen University wrote in big-character posters: Indian expansionists are undermining the principles of the Bandung Conference and openly interfering in our internal affairs. We resolutely oppose this behavior.

    Many people's organizations and cadres of government agencies, overseas Chinese, and religious figures in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have held symposiums. Cao Ji, vice chairman of the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Federation, said at the meeting that the clamor of Indian expansionists to interfere in our internal affairs seriously threatens the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indian people and the principles of peaceful coexistence. We Chinese people, including overseas Chinese, never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and adhere to the principles of peaceful coexistence, but we will never allow others to interfere in our internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th: The broad masses of people in Shenyang and Liaoning Province have been condemning the Indian expansionists' attempts to use the Tibetan rebellion to interfere in China's internal affairs.

    The 1,494 representatives attending the Liaoning Provincial Advanced Producers Representative Conference in Shenyang expressed great indignation at the Indian expansionists' open support for the Tibetan armed rebellion and interference in China's internal affairs. Li Jiatong, the leader of the No. 24 Open Hearth Furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel, said: "The conspiracy of certain politicians in India to attempt to split Tibet from great China will inevitably fail. He expressed his intention to organize all the workers in the furnace to produce more steel and better steel with practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the Tibetan rebellion, so that the Tibetan people can bathe in the sunshine of socialism as soon as possible." The workers expressed great anger at all the words and deeds of certain reactionary parties in India that insulted our country, and believed that the Indian authorities should be responsible for these matters.

    Monks and nuns in various temples in Shenyang have been holding meetings for days to oppose the conspiracies of imperialists and Indian expansionists to interfere in China's internal affairs. Dao Chen, President of the Liaoning Provincial Buddhist Association and Abbot of Ci'en Temple, said: "As a person who believes in Buddhism, I express unparalleled anger at the shameless conspiracy of foreign reactionaries and Indian expansionists to interfere in China's internal affairs. Tibet is Chinese territory, an inseparable part of the big family of all ethnic groups in the motherland. Quelling the rebellion is our internal affair, and no foreign interference is allowed."

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 25th: The acts of imperialists and Indian expansionists in interfering in China's internal affairs have aroused great anger among people from all walks of life in Chongqing. They unanimously stated that they would resolutely counter foreign interferers with practical actions.

    Many factory workers are extremely indignant at the interference of imperialists and foreign reactionaries in our internal affairs. Ma Haiqing, a steelmaking worker at the Open Hearth Steelmaking Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, said that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and quelling the Tibetan rebellion is our internal affair, and imperialists and Indian expansionists are absolutely not allowed to interfere. All the workers in our open hearth steelmaking plant resolutely do a good job in loading more materials, speeding up smelting, and relining furnaces to counter foreign interferers with practical actions of smelting more and better steel.

    Religious figures in Chongqing City held a symposium on the 23rd, expressing their indignation at the acts of imperialists and Indian expansionists in interfering in China's internal affairs. Shi Taikong, President of the Chongqing Buddhist Association, said that Indian expansionists tore off their masks and openly interfered in our country's internal affairs, which is really intolerable. He said that he had lived in the Tibetan region for seventeen years and had been to the Shannan area, and had personally seen the people in the wealthy Shannan area living a very painful life under the rule of the upper-level reactionaries. He was particularly pleased that the People's Liberation Army quickly quelled the bandits in the Shannan area. Ding Qishan, Imam of Chongqing Islam, refuted the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" with facts, saying that the Party and the government protect the people's freedom of religious belief, which is an undeniable fact. Our mosques have been renovated with the help of the government. In contrast, the Tibetan rebels, wearing religious cloaks, committed murder, arson, and destroyed temples, committing all kinds of evil. All the Muslims in our city deeply hate the crimes of the Tibetan rebel group and resolutely condemn the acts of imperialists and Indian expansionists in interfering in our internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 25th: People from all walks of life in Xi'an are angrily condemning the words and deeds of imperialists and Indian expansionists in using the Tibetan rebellion to interfere in China's internal affairs. When workers, peasants, students, and citizens throughout the city read the so-called second statement of the Dalai Lama, which was published under the manipulation of certain people, and the clamor of Indian expansionists interfering in our internal affairs, they all felt righteous indignation and vowed to support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions to thoroughly and cleanly quell the Tibetan rebellion.

    The advanced production group and Zeng Shiyao assembly group of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Plant held a symposium this afternoon, and they very angrily warned the Indian expansionists not to interfere in China's internal affairs. Zeng Shiyao said: We resolutely support and support the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly suppressing the Tibetan rebels. The conspiracy of Indian expansionists to attempt to undermine our country's unity and realize their expansionist ambitions is destined to fail.

    Lang Zhao, Director of the Chinese Buddhist Association and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Xi'an Buddhist Association, and Guan Da Lama (Tibetan) of Guangren Temple, who is also a Director of the Chinese Buddhist Association, said in their speeches that the conspiracy of rebels and those Indian expansionists to split the unity of our motherland will not only fail, but will also make the Tibetan monks, officials, and working people love the motherland even more, and our motherland's big family will be even more united.
