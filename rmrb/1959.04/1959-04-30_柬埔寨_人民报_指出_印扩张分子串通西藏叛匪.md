Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 28th. The Cambodian "People's Daily" published an article today condemning Indian expansionists for "colluding with a rebellious group serving the interests of imperialism, conducting political activities against another Bandung Conference participating country from Indian territory."

The newspaper expressed regret over India's attitude towards the Tibetan rebellion. It said, "The attitude taken by India, one of the largest countries participating in the Bandung Conference, on the Tibetan issue has worsened the situation. A small group of Indian expansionists who undermine the Bandung spirit are conducting activities to alienate the friendly relations between China and India, and are openly interfering in China's internal affairs. It is doubtful whether these activities are carried out without the permission of the Indian authorities."

The newspaper asked, "In this way, what is the difference between the activities of the Indian expansionists and the activities of the Thais who carry out propaganda for the traitors of Cambodia, and the support of the imperialists and their running dogs in South Vietnam for Somsanith and Chao Boret?"

After describing the background and course of the Tibetan rebellion at great length, the newspaper pointed out that the rebellion was launched by a small group of Tibetan reactionaries against the will of the Tibetan people, and they were supported by imperialists and traitors who had fled abroad.

    柬埔寨“人民报”指出
    印扩张分子串通西藏叛匪
    新华社金边28日电　柬埔寨“人民报”今天刊载文章，谴责印度扩张主义分子“串通一个为帝国主义利益服务的叛乱集团，从印度的领土上进行反对另一个万隆会议参加国的政治活动。”
    这家报纸对印度在西藏叛乱事件上采取的态度表示遗憾。它说，“参加万隆会议的最大的国家之一印度在西藏事件上采取的态度使情况有了恶化。一小撮破坏万隆精神的印度的扩张主义者进行活动来离间中印之间的友好关系，并且公开地干涉中国的内政。进行这些活动时是否没有得到印度当局的许可是值得怀疑的。”
    这家报纸问道，“这样，印度扩张主义者的活动同为柬埔寨的卖国贼进行宣传的泰国人的活动，以及帝国主义者和他们在南越的走狗支持桑萨里和萧博雷的活动有什么不同呢？”
    这家报纸用极大的篇幅叙述了西藏叛乱的背景和经过以后指出，这次叛乱是一小撮西藏的反动分子违反西藏人民的意志而发动的，他们得到帝国主义者和逃亡国外的叛国分子的支持。
