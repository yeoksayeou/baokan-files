Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: According to Western news agencies, former Burmese Prime Minister U Nu said to reporters in New York on April 13th that "from a purely legal point of view, Tibet must be considered a part of China." U Nu stated that he believes Tibet is an inseparable part of China, but at the same time he said that it would be best for China to let Tibet "become independent."

U Nu made these remarks before leaving New York to go to Washington. The news said that he was going to the United States to attend the World Religious Conference held in Texas. According to reports, when U Nu spoke to American reporters about the relationship between Burma and China, U Nu said that China's attitude towards Burma has always been correct. He also said that he did not know whether the Chinese were suppressing Buddhism in Tibet, and that as far as he knew, "Buddhism is encouraged in mainland China."

A reporter asked him whether he thought Burma could maintain its neutral position, given that China and Burma share a long border. U Nu replied, "We believe we can maintain it." U Nu emphasized that Burma pursues a neutral policy.

During this conversation with American reporters, U Nu also reportedly advocated that China establish a "high-level committee" to "investigate the real reasons for the current events in Tibet" and find a way to give the Tibetan people "independence" as soon as possible.

Following this conversation, on April 14th, at a press conference arranged by the Burmese delegation to the United Nations, U Nu said that the rebellion in Tibet was "political rather than religious," that there is religious freedom in Tibet, and that the Tibetan rebellion has not changed his view that China will abide by international obligations. However, he also mentioned the idea of ​​establishing a "committee" to "investigate" the situation in Tibet and find a way to make Tibet "independent."

According to the Indian Press Trust, U Nu was unwilling to comment on the Tibetan rebellion when passing through London on his way to the United States. U Nu said, "The Chinese are very particular about etiquette in social interactions and always honor their commitments." U Nu also said that when he stayed overnight in New Delhi, Nehru told him about the situation in Tibet. He said that as an active neutral person, he would judge based on right and wrong, while maintaining friendly relations with both China and other parties.

Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: Hong Kong News: Former Burmese Prime Minister U Nu told reporters in Hong Kong today that China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion would not affect Sino-Burmese relations because "this is China's internal affair." However, he also said, "We sympathize with the Tibetans."

    吴努承认事实却发表谬见
    既说西藏是中国不可分割的一部分
    又说什么最好中国让西藏“独立”
    新华社23日讯　据西方通讯社报道，前缅甸总理吴努4月13日在纽约向记者发表谈话说，“从纯粹的法律观点来看，必须认为西藏是中国的一部分”。吴努表示，他认为西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，但同时他又说，最好中国让西藏“独立”。
    吴努是在即将离开纽约前赴华盛顿的时候说这番话的。消息说，他这次去美国，是为了参加在得克萨斯州举行的世界宗教家会议。据报道，吴努在同美国记者谈到缅甸同中国的关系时，吴努说，中国对缅甸的态度一向是正确的。他还说，他不知道中国人是否在压制西藏的佛教，他说，就他所知，“在中国大陆是鼓励佛教的”。
    记者问他，中缅两国共有很长的边境，他是否认为缅甸能够保持它的中立地位。吴努回答说，“我们认为能够保持。”吴努强调缅甸执行中立政策。
    在这次和美记者的谈话中，据报道，吴努还主张由中国成立一个“高级委员会”来“调查西藏目前事件的真正原因”，找出尽可能早地给西藏人民“独立的办法”。
    在这一次谈话以后，4月14日，在缅甸驻联合国代表团安排的一次记者招待会上，吴努说，西藏的叛乱是“政治性的而不是宗教性的”，在西藏有宗教自由，西藏叛乱并没有使他改变他认为中国会遵守国际义务这样一种看法。但是他又谈到成立一个“委员会”来“调查”西藏局势和找出使西藏“独立”的办法的主张。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，吴努在路经伦敦前来美国时不愿意对西藏叛乱事件表示看法。吴努说，“中国人在社交上很崇尚礼法，不管他们答应什么总是兑现的”。吴努还说，当他在新德里逗留一夜的时候，尼赫鲁曾经把西藏局势告诉了他。他表示，作为一个积极中立的人，他要根据是非曲直来作出判断，同时和中国方面以及其他方面都保持友好的关系。
    据新华社25日讯　香港消息：前缅甸总理吴努今天在香港对新闻记者说，中国平息西藏叛乱一事将不会影响中缅之间的关系，因为“这是中国的内政”。但是，他又说，“我们同情西藏人”。
