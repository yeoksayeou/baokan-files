　　This day, Randolph Harmon, in a towering rage, waved a pistol, vowing to send a meddling reporter "back home." What had provoked this US Congressman to such fury? It turned out that a reporter from the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain discovered on the US Congressional staff roster that Congressman Harmon's secretary was none other than Mrs. Harmon, with an annual salary of four thousand four hundred twenty-four dollars, one dime, and six cents, and this secretary never even came to the Capitol Building in Washington to work. Of course, Congressman Harmon was allowed to set up an office in his constituency at public expense. So the reporter went to Harmon's hometown of Muncie, Indiana, and there, sure enough, found Mrs. Harmon "兼 secretary" busy with household chores, and discovered that her so-called "office" was just a porch room next to her house, for which the public had to pay Harmon a monthly rent of one hundred dollars. (By the way, Harmon bought the entire house on an installment plan, paying only fifty-four dollars and fifty cents a month.) In this way, Congressman Harmon pocketed more than five thousand six hundred dollars a year from the wallets of American taxpayers.

　　A porch room stirred up a storm. Harmon's corruption scandal aroused widespread criticism from ordinary Americans. No wonder he was furious.

　　In fact, the corrupt practices that Harmon engaged in have been "common practice" for his fellow congressmen for many years. Mr. Harmon, who is also the owner of a machine factory in Indiana, spent a lot of money running for Congress eight times in sixteen years. Finally, "where there's a will, there's a way," and he was finally elected last year. In order to recoup his investment, he followed the convention of the American officialdom and had his wife listed as a "secretary" to receive a dry salary, which was "无可厚非" (not to be condemned too severely); however, bringing out the porch room as a means of recouping the investment was a bit too much. But this is not surprising, because he is still a novice after all. As for those veterans, they are different. Their wives or children, or sisters, or brothers, or aunts, etc., do not only receive sums of more than four thousand dollars like Mrs. Harmon, but as much as ten thousand dollars or more. For example, Congressman Wallf's wife receives an annual salary of thirteen thousand three hundred forty-four dollars; Senator Carroll's daughter, while studying at university, receives a "secretary" salary of twelve thousand five hundred dollars; Congressman Carter's nineteen-year-old son, who is still studying in a university preparatory class, is listed as a "staff member" with an annual salary of eleven thousand eight hundred seventy-three dollars and twenty cents. The families of these congressional masters not only have high salaries, but also fast pay raises. For example, Congressman Hodges only "hired" his wife as a secretary in January of this year, with an annual salary of ten thousand and forty-one dollars, and in February he gave her a raise of one thousand three hundred and forty-one dollars.

　　Of all the five hundred or so members of the US Congress, how many are engaged in this kind of corruption? The estimates of various bourgeois newspapers in the United States vary. "U.S. News & World Report" says it is one-seventh, and the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain says it is one-fifth. However, ultimately, "The New York Herald Tribune" is right: only those who are "proficient in genealogy" can figure out this mess, because on the list of staff members employed by members of Congress with public funds, one can only find out whether a member of Congress employs relatives from the fact that they have the same surname, "and a wife who uses her maiden name, a married daughter, or a close relative, is simply impossible to find out."

　　Of course, in the eyes of the money-worshipping American congressmen, playing some tricks on the issue of employing staff and pocketing ten or twenty thousand dollars a year from the national treasury is insignificant, and even not considered corruption at all. Therefore, despite the fact that the "porch room storm" has become a nationwide sensation, the Eisenhower government, which is full of benevolence, morality and busy investigating the so-called corruption case of union leaders, has remained silent, and the congressmen, except for Harmon, who is a little impatient, are all at ease and shameless. While the whole country was talking about it, the House Administration Committee still passed a bill stipulating that each member of Congress can hire an additional "administrative assistant" with an annual salary of fourteen thousand one hundred and sixty-two dollars. It seems that another group of wives, children, sisters, brothers, aunts, etc., will be added to the congressional staff roster. This is exactly: let them laugh and scold as they please, I will continue to be corrupt!

　　However, the congressional masters who are so generous with the American taxpayers are very "impartial" to the vast American taxpayers. Today, many people in the United States are struggling on the poverty line, and the number of unemployed has approached six and a half million; many American school-age children are excluded from school because there are not enough school buildings; the housing shortage is very serious, and the living conditions of many families need to be improved urgently. All of this needs to be resolved by the US Congress allocating funds. However, it is on these issues that the congressional masters have shown their "thrift" virtue. Not only do they not allocate new funds to solve the urgent problems of the vast people, but they also abolish some of the original federal relief programs. For example, although the unemployment situation in the United States is getting worse and worse, and the continuous rise in prices has made it difficult for unemployed families to survive solely on unemployment benefits; the US House of Representatives recently passed a bill deciding not to provide federal subsidies to all workers who are unemployed after March 31. It is truly adding insult to injury!

　　It is said that American congressmen represent the will of the voters. However, from the porch room storm to adding insult to injury to unemployed workers, if they can represent anything dirty, it is not representing the American voters, wouldn't that be more correct? (Attached image)

　　US Congressmen pushing a stroller, singing: "Little baby! My good baby! Don't cry, don't make noise! When the baby grows up, I will make your salary as high as Mommy's!" The text next to the White House reads: "Home, sweet home." (Originally published in the American "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette")

    议员的生财之道
    施旅
    这一天，伦道夫·哈蒙怒发冲冠地摇着一杆手枪，发誓要送一位多管闲事的记者“回老家”。是什么事情惹得这位美国众议员先生大冒其火的呢？事情是这样的：斯克利浦斯—霍华德报系的一名记者在美国国会职员花名册上发现众议员哈蒙的秘书就是哈蒙太太，年支薪金四千四百二十四元一角六分，而这位秘书却并不到华盛顿的国会大厦来上班。当然，议员哈蒙按规定是可以在他的选区用公款设立一处办公室的。于是这位记者就跑到哈蒙在印第安那州门西市的老家去，在那里果然碰到了忙于家务的哈蒙太太“兼秘书”，而且发现她的所谓“办公室”就是她家门廊旁的一间廊房，为了这间“办公室”，公家每月须向哈蒙支付租金一百元。（顺便提一下，哈蒙用分期付款办法买下的这整所房子，每月也只不过付出五十四元五角。）就这样，议员哈蒙每年从美国纳税人的钱袋里白捞了五千六百余元。
    一间廊房顿起风波，哈蒙的贪污丑闻引起了普通美国人的纷纷抨击，难怪他要恼羞成怒了。
    其实，哈蒙所干的贪污勾当正是他的议员同行们多少年来的“家常便饭”。这位同时又是印第安那州一家机器厂老板的哈蒙先生，十六年里八次竞选议员，花了不少钱，最后“有志者事竟成”，终于在去年被选上。他为了捞回本钱，按美国官场的惯例让自己的老婆挂名“秘书”领干薪，原是“无可厚非”的；不过，把廊房也请出来作为捞本的手段，未免有点不像话。然而这也难怪，因为他毕竟还是个新手。至于那些老手们，可就不同了，他们的老婆或子女、或姊妹、或兄弟、或姑妈等等，就不像哈蒙太太那样仅仅领取四千余元之数，而是高达万元以上。譬如：众议员华尔夫的太太每年就支薪一万三千三百四十四元；参议员卡洛尔的女儿一面在大学里念书，一面领取“秘书”薪金一万二千五百元；众议员卡特的尚在大学预备班读书的十九岁的儿子被列名为“工作人员”，年支一万一千八百七十三元二角。这些议员老爷的家属们不仅薪金高，而且加薪快，例如，众议员哈吉斯今年1月份才“聘请”他的老婆为秘书，年薪一万零四十一元，2月份就为她加薪一千三百四十一元。
    在美国全部五百余名国会议员中，究竟有多少人从事这种贪污勾当呢？美国各资产阶级报刊的估计不一，“美国新闻与世界报道”说是七分之一，斯克利浦斯—霍华德报系说是五分之一，然而，归根到底还是“纽约先驱论坛报”说得对：只有“精通家谱学”的人才能弄清楚这一笔烂账，因为在国会议员用公款雇用的工作人员名册上，只能从姓氏相同这一点来查出某议员是否雇用亲属，“而一位用娘家姓的妻子，一位出了嫁的女儿，或者一位内亲，则简直是不可能查出来的”。
    当然，在拜金主义的美国议员老爷们心目中，在雇用工作人员的问题上玩些小花样，每年从国库里白捞万把两万块钱，是微不足道，甚至根本算不得什么贪污的。因而，尽管“廊房的风波”闹得满城风雨，满口仁义道德并且忙于追究所谓工会领袖贪污案的艾森豪威尔政府却一声也不响，议员老爷们除了哈蒙有点沉不住气之外，也都泰然处之，面无愧色。就在举国议论纷纷之际，众议院行政委员会仍然通过一项法案，规定每一位议员可以加聘一名年俸一万四千一百六十二元的“行政助理”。看来，又要有一批太太、子女、姊妹、兄弟、姑妈等等列入国会职员花名册了。这正是：笑骂由他笑骂，贪污我自为之！
    然而，对于自己如此慷美国纳税人之慨的议员老爷们，对于广大的美国纳税人却是十分“铁面无私”的。今天美国有不少人在饥饿线上挣扎，失业人数已接近六百五十万；不少美国学龄儿童因为校舍不够而被摒弃于校门之外；房荒情况十分严重，许多人家的居住条件急需改善。所有这一切，都有待于美国国会拨款予以解决。但是，正是在这些问题上，议员老爷们表现了他们的“节约”美德。他们不但不拨出新的款项来解决广大人民急需解决的问题，而且把原有的一些联邦救济计划也取消了。譬如，尽管美国的失业情况越来越恶化，物价的不断上涨已经使得失业的家庭难以仅仅依靠失业救济金过活；但是美国众议院最近还是通过了一项法案，决定对3月31日以后失业的一切工人不再给予联邦补助。真是投井下石！
    据说美国的议员是代表选民的意志的。然而从廊房的风波到对失业工人投井下石，如果说他们可以代表任何肮脏的东西，就是不代表美国的选民，这样岂不是更正确一些吗？（附图片）
    美国国会议员推着小车，嘴里唱着：“小宝宝！我的好宝宝！不要哭，不要闹！宝宝长大了，我让你和妈咪薪水一样高！”白宫旁字样是：“家，甜蜜的家。”　（原载美国“匹兹堡邮报”）
