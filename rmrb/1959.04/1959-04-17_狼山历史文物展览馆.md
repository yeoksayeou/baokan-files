　　When the rape flowers are fragrant during the Qingming Festival,
　　Visiting Langshan together, our spirits are high.
　　Reflecting on the past and present, we are delighted to see,
　　Leaning on the railing, our eyes are filled with the yellow of the Yangtze River.

　　The exhibition hall not only displays ancient cultural relics, but also modern arts and crafts. The day we climbed Langshan was the Qingming Festival.

    狼山历史文物展览馆
    清明时节菜花香，
    共访狼山意兴长。
    酌古斟今欣快睹，
    凭阑满眼大江黄。
　　展览馆中不仅展出古文物，也有现代的工艺美术品。我们登狼山那一天是清明节。
