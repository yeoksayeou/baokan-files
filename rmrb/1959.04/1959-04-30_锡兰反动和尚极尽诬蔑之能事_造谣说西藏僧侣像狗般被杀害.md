Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, April 27th.
    A supporter of the Ceylon United National Party, the secretary of the newly established Ceylon Buddhist Monks Association, Malewana Gnanissara, wrote an article in the "Daily Sun" on the 27th entitled "Monks Killed Like Dogs," in which he viciously slandered China and went to the extremes of rumor-mongering and vilification regarding the Tibetan rebellion.
    He fabricated rumors, saying: "More than 14,000 Buddhist monks were killed like dogs. Many Buddhist temples were razed to the ground." He maliciously distorted the history of Tibet, which is a part of China, and insisted that Tibet was an independent "country." Ignoring the fact that the Dalai Lama was abducted, he claimed that "the Dalai Lama was driven out of the country" and falsely accused China of "taking measures to completely eliminate Buddhism."
    He described China's peaceful liberation of Tibet as "Communist China's invasion of this country."
    He also spread rumors that "Tibetans were made crazy by being given opium."

    锡兰反动和尚极尽诬蔑之能事
    造谣说西藏僧侣像狗般被杀害
    据新华社科伦坡27日电　锡兰统一国民党的支持者、新成立的锡兰佛教僧侣协会的书记马勒瓦纳·格纳尼萨腊在27日的“每日太阳报”写了一篇题叫“僧侣像狗一样地被杀害”的文章，在西藏叛乱事件上极其恶毒地诽谤中国，极尽造谣污蔑的能事。
    他造谣说：“一万四千多名佛教僧侣像狗一样被杀害。许多佛教寺院被夷为平地。”他恶意歪曲作为中国的一部分的西藏的历史，硬说西藏是个独立的“国家”。他不顾达赖喇嘛被劫持的事实，竟说“达赖喇嘛被赶出了这个国家”，并且诬蔑中国“采取措施要完全消灭佛教”。
    他把中国和平解放西藏说成是“共产党中国侵扰了这个国家”。
    他并且造谣说，“由于让西藏人吸鸦片，弄得他们疯疯癫癫。”
