Chongqing's Commercial Work Advances Victoriously
Speech by Committee Member Liu Kunshui

    Achievements of the past year: Overfulfilled various national plans; promoted industrial and agricultural production, basically ensuring the people's livelihood needs; improved service quality; directly participated in production; everyone contributed ideas, and everything was innovated.

    Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I not only fully agree with Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report on the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but also warmly support Premier Zhou Enlai's political report and the various reports of government departments at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, and resolutely take them back to my work post to actively implement them.

    1958 was a year of earth-shattering, unprecedented, and leap-forward progress! This year, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, on the basis of the victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, the people of the whole country were full of confidence, high in spirit, and soaring in energy, fully displaying their wisdom and strength, and achieving unprecedented great victories in various socialist construction undertakings, writing a glorious and splendid page in the history of the motherland. Especially during the autumn harvest last year, a new form of social organization emerged throughout the country like the rising sun, shining with immense brilliance—the people's commune. This organization embodies the great creation of more than 500 million farmers. These large-scale people's communes, combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, integrating government administration with commune management, stood tall on the land of Asia, accompanied by the joy and praise of hundreds of millions of people, becoming the best form for accelerating socialist construction and future transition to communism; at the same time, it was a world event that made friends happy and enemies disheartened.

    While our great motherland is progressing by leaps and bounds, the commercial work in Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, like all other parts of the country, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction and driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, has presented a lively scene of vibrant colors and comprehensive leap forward! Over the past year, our vast number of commercial workers, under the direct leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees, have always maintained full revolutionary enthusiasm and soaring revolutionary vigor, focusing on the central work of the Party, constantly launching high tides of leap forward and further leap forward, fundamentally changing the face of commerce, and achieving great results.

    First, overfulfilling various national plans. Procurement completed 124.21 percent, an increase of 63.39 percent compared to 1957; sales completed 115.54 percent, an increase of 58.88 percent compared to 1957; accumulation completed 113.8 percent, an increase of 47.52 percent compared to 1957. While comprehensively completing the plans, along with the people of the city, a steelmaking campaign was launched among the employees, with a total of 1,587 tons of steel produced throughout the year.

    Second, promoting industrial and agricultural production and basically ensuring the needs of the people's livelihood. Our commercial workers, through debate, realized that production is fundamental and commerce is the link; and through education on political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, clearly established the viewpoint of "everything starts from production, always cares about production, and supports production everywhere" among the employees. Therefore, in business activities, they tried every possible means to promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, such as solving the problems of raw materials and technical equipment for industry's fight against drought; in supporting agricultural production, they actively helped solve the problems of seeds, technical equipment, agricultural fertilizers, and pesticides. Especially in supporting steelmaking production, they conscientiously implemented the principle of "letting, assisting, and squeezing," and adopted various methods such as "digging, salvaging, searching, and substituting," which strongly supported the "three marshals" taking command. In terms of the supply of daily necessities, due to the active and proactive organization of goods, daily industrial products increased by 54 percent compared to 1957, and non-staple foods increased by 92 percent compared to 1957, basically meeting the needs of the people's livelihood.

    Third, innovating service outlook and improving service quality. Our vast number of salespersons and service personnel, through the great debate of "serving whom and working for whom," generally achieved a kind and friendly attitude, warm and thoughtful service, and established a new relationship of mutual respect and mutual assistance with customers. At the same time, in terms of service methods, such as opening counters, opening up business, delivering goods to the grassroots, and providing door-to-door service. In the setting up of business outlets, it was generally achieved: there are points by the stove and burdens by the field. In terms of business hours, there were also cargo trucks in the morning and night markets in the evening, and some stores even implemented all-night business. In terms of service items, there have been general increases, such as facilitating consumers to withdraw money on behalf of customers, and sending mail on behalf of customers. Due to the innovation of the service outlook, the connection between the Party, the government, and the people has been greatly strengthened, so consumers reflected: "March 8th stores are like homes, sales comrades are like relatives, people's stores are loved by everyone, and people's stores are renewed every day."

    Fourth, while supporting industrial and agricultural production, they also directly participated in production themselves. In addition to doing a good job in purchasing, selling, adjusting, and storing, based on the spirit of filling gaps and supplementing deficiencies for industry, in accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions, making use of simple and crude equipment, requiring less investment, and achieving quick results, a total of 57 factories were built last year, producing more than 150 varieties, with a total output value of 24.55 million yuan. Commercial enterprises running industries is a new approach, especially some processing industries such as refitting, processing, and repairing. In this way, on the one hand, it can make up for the shortcomings of industrial production and enrich the material strength of the market; on the other hand, it also trains cadres, who are not only familiar with commodities but also able to repair, assemble, and maintain commodities. At the same time, some new developments have also been achieved in production, such as creating and innovating yarn guides to increase work efficiency by 62 times; extracting white sugar from sweet potatoes; using Junda vegetables (cowhide vegetables) to make soy sauce; extracting 26 kinds of industrial products from pig by-products, expanding comprehensive utilization; the quality of Chongqing Tea Factory in manufacturing black tea has already caught up with international standards; we have also successfully trial-produced more than 30 kinds of precision products such as ammeters and X-ray machines.

    In addition, in carrying out the technical revolution and cultural revolution, a new trend of "everyone contributing ideas and everything being innovated" has been formed. In particular, after the vast number of employees have undergone mass movements such as steelmaking and socialist and communist ideological education on the basis of the rectification campaign, their ideological awareness has been significantly improved, their mental outlook has undergone profound changes, and they have generally established a communist labor attitude, carried forward the communist style, and the spirit of continuous revolution. There is no doubt that the achievements of our city's commercial work are brilliant. However, the attainment of these achievements is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party committee, the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, the cooperation and coordination of relevant departments, and the strong impetus of the great leap forward situation in the whole country and the whole province.

    Now, with the four major indicators as the center, the large-scale 1959 plan has been placed before us. Premier Zhou clearly requires in his report that commercial work: comprehensively arrange the market, do a good job in supply, and prevent the disconnection between supply and demand. We believe that we have enough confidence to complete this task. We should continue to rely on the absolute leadership of the Party committee and the broad strength of the employees on the basis of the victory in 1958, firmly grasp the outline of everything for production, continue to boost our energy, comprehensively leap forward, and our commercial work will surely appear in a newer atmosphere in the shortest time, making contributions to welcoming the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the great tenth anniversary of the National Day.

    重庆商业工作在乘胜前进
    刘昆水委员的发言
    一年来的成绩是：超额完成了各项国家计划；促进了工农业生产，基本保证了人民生活需要；服务质量提高；直接参与生产；人人献计，事事革新。主席、各位委员：
    我除了完全同意李维汉副主席关于全国政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告外，并热烈地拥护全国人民代表大会二届首次会议上周恩来总理的政治报告和政府部门的各项报告，坚决带回到工作岗位上积极地贯彻执行。
    一九五八年，是惊天动地，史无前例，飞跃进展的一年！这一年，是在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在全民整风运动和反右斗争胜利的基础上，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民信心百倍，斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，充分发挥了智慧和力量，在社会主义建设的各项事业中，获得了空前伟大的胜利，在祖国历史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页。特别是在去年秋收时间，在全国范围内出现了如旭日东升，光芒万丈的新的社会组织形式——人民公社，这一组织包含着五亿多农民的伟大创举，这些规模巨大的，工农商学兵相结合的，政社合一的人民公社，伴和着亿万人民的欢乐和歌颂，屹立在亚洲的大地上，成为加速社会主义建设和将来过渡到共产主义的最好的形式；同时也是让朋友高兴，敌人丧胆的世界大事。
    在我们伟大的祖国一日千里地向前进展的时间里，四川省重庆市的商业工作，与全国各地一样，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进的推动下，出现了一个万紫千红，全面跃进的生动局面！一年来，我们广大的商业职工，在省、市党委的直接领导下，始终保持着饱满的革命热情和冲天的革命干劲，围绕着党的中心工作，不断地掀起跃进再跃进的高潮，基本改变了商业面貌，成绩是巨大的。
    第一，超额地完成了各项国家计划。购进方面完成百分之一百二十四点二一，比一九五七年增长百分之六十三点三九；销售方面完成百分之一百一十五点五四，比一九五七年增长百分之五十八点八八；积累方面完成百分之一百一十三点八，比一九五七年增长百分之四十七点五二。在全面完成计划的同时，与全市人民一道，在职工中展开了炼钢运动，全年炼钢为一千五百八十七吨。
    第二，促进工农业生产，基本保证了人民生活的需要。我们商业职工通过辩论，认识了生产是根本，商业是纽带；以及通过政治观点、生产观点、群众观点的教育，在职工群众中鲜明地树立了“一切从生产出发，时时关心生产，处处支援生产”的观点，因而在业务活动中，千方百计想方设法为促进工农业生产发展，如为工业抗旱解决原材料及技术设备力量等；在支援农业生产方面，积极帮助解决种籽、技术设备、农肥、农药等。特别在支援炼钢生产方面，认真地贯彻了“让、援、挤”的方针，采取“挖、捞、找、代”等多种办法，有力地支援了“三大元帅”升帐。在生活日用品的供应方面，由于主动积极地组织货源，日用工业品比一九五七年增长百分之五十四，副食品比一九五七年增长百分之九十二，基本上满足了人民生活的需要。
    第三，革新服务面貌，提高服务质量。我们广大的营业员、服务员，通过“为谁服务，为谁劳动”的大辩论，普遍做到态度和蔼亲切，服务热情周到，与顾客之间建立了互敬、互助的新关系。同时在服务方式上，如打开柜台，敞起营业，送货下段，服务到家。在营业点设置上，普遍做到：炉边有点，田边有担。在营业时间上，也做到了朝有货车，夕有夜市，部分商店还实行了通宵营业。在服务项目上，普遍都有了增加，如方便消费者代客取款，代客寄邮等。由于服务面貌的革新，大大密切了党、政府同人民群众的联系，所以消费者反映说：“三八商店如家庭，售货同志如亲人，人民商店人人爱，人民商店日日新。”
    第四，支援工农业生产的同时，本身也直接地参与生产。我们在搞好购、销、调、存之外，根据为工业填空补缺的精神，按照因地制宜，因陋就简，投资少，收效快的原则，在去年一共兴建了五十七个工厂，生产了一百五十多种品种，总产值达到二千四百五十五万元。商业办工业，是一个新的途径，特别是一些改装、加工和修理等的加工工业。这样，一方面可以弥补工业生产的不足，充裕了市场的物资力量；另一方面也锻炼了干部，不仅熟悉商品，而且会修理装配和保养商品。同时在生产上还取得了一些新的发展，如创造革新导纱机，提高工效六十二倍；用红薯提制白糖；用君达菜（牛皮菜）制造酱油；从猪的副产品中提炼出二十六种工业产品，扩大了综合利用；重庆茶厂在制造红茶时，质量已经赶上国际水平；我们还试制成功了电流表，X光机等三十种以上的精密产品。
    此外，在开展技术革命和文化革命方面，已经形成了“人人献计，事事革新”的新风气。特别是广大职工在整风运动的基础上，又经过炼钢等的群众运动和社会主义共产主义思想教育后，思想觉悟有了显著提高，精神面貌发生了深刻变化，普遍树立了共产主义劳动态度，发扬了共产主义风格和不断革命的精神。毫无疑问，我市商业工作的成绩是光辉的。但这些成绩的获得，是和党委正确领导，群众冲天干劲，有关部门协作配合和全国、全省范围内的大跃进形势的有力推动分不开的。
    现在，以四大指标为中心，规模宏大的一九五九年计划已摆在我们面前，周总理在报告中明确地要求商业工作：全面安排市场，做好供应工作，防止供求脱节。我们相信这一任务是有足够的信心来完成的。我们应当在一九五八年的胜利基础上，继续依靠党委的绝对领导和职工群众的广大力量，紧紧地抓住一切为生产的纲，继续鼓足干劲，全面跃进，我们的商业工作一定会在最短时间内，出现更新的气象，为迎接工农业生产更大的跃进和伟大的十周年国庆作出贡献。
