Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 25th: Some figures in Indian political circles continue to exploit the Tibetan rebellion to fan the flames, spout nonsense, and engage in activities that poison Sino-Indian friendship and interfere in China's internal affairs. According to today's "Indian Express", at a meeting held in Delhi on the 24th, the Deputy Mayor of Delhi, Sani, leader of the Indian People's Alliance, and Social Party leaders Datt and Ahmeddin, all made vicious attacks on China. They described the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as a "suppression of the Tibetan uprising", and, resorting to vile imperialist slanders, they railed that "Communist imperialism has destroyed Tibet's autonomy."

They also attempted to incite anti-China sentiment among the Indian people, falsely claiming that "the Chinese have shaken the Indian people's sense of peace," and "India cannot continue to remain indifferent to the threat to its security from the north." They also fabricated lies to create pretexts for interfering in China's internal affairs, saying that "the value of Tibetan lives has been destroyed, and there is no personal freedom in Tibet. India cannot continue to be a silent bystander to this state of affairs."

Sani and others also took the opportunity to incite opposition to the Indian Communist Party, saying that "the Tibetan incident has clearly proven that the Communists are a danger to India," and therefore, they must oppose the Indian Communist Party.

The meeting passed a "resolution" expressing "heartfelt" welcome to the Dalai Lama.

The "resolution" even referred to Tibet as a "country" and expressed great "concern" for a small group of Tibetan rebels who had fled to India. The resolution stated, "Those Tibetans who have been forced to leave their country of birth and need asylum will find refuge in this country (India)."

Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: New Delhi Dispatch: Some Indian newspapers openly advocate that India convene a meeting to discuss the Tibetan issue, which is purely China's internal affair. This absurd proposition fully reflects the conspiracy and ambition of Indian expansionists.

The "Statesman" on the 21st openly stated in the tone of an interventionist, "It seems that the next logical step is for India to convene a friendly round table conference. It is possible to persuade both the Chinese Premier and the Dalai Lama to attend the meeting."

The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" of the same day also said in a similar tone, "If Beijing hopes he (the Dalai Lama) will return, and the Dalai Lama is willing to return to Lhasa, there is no better time than to hold negotiations in India now." It said, "There is nothing to prevent the Chinese government from establishing contact with the Dalai Lama, and we have no doubt that Prime Minister Nehru will provide all necessary facilities for establishing contact." It also absurdly demanded that Chinese national leaders take the initiative to go to India to participate in "negotiations" "sponsored by India." It arrogantly said, "There is nothing to prevent Premier Zhou Enlai from visiting this country."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 23rd: The "Hindustan Standard" today openly proposed a plan to interfere in China's internal affairs in an editorial, saying that the "permanent solution" to the Tibetan issue "must depend on some understanding reached between China, Tibet—and India."

The editorial also said in a threatening tone, "This understanding is only possible if the issue is confined to the three of us and not allowed to become an item in the Cold War. China's insistence on taking unilateral action may have a seemingly contradictory effect, which is to push the issue in the latter direction." This editorial, full of expansionist sentiment, also distorted the commentary by a Xinhua News Agency political reporter on the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" as "an almost undisguised threat."

    印度政界中的反华活动日益嚣张
    一些政党领袖集会叫嚷印度对我国平定西藏叛乱不能旁观
    一些报纸竟主张印度出面在印度召开会议讨论所谓西藏问题
    新华社新德里25日电　印度一些政界人士继续利用西藏叛乱事件煽风点火，大放厥词，进行毒化印中友谊、干涉中国内政的活动。据“印度快报”今天消息，24日在德里召开的一个集会上，德里副市长、印度人民同盟领袖萨尼、社会党领袖杜特和艾哈迈德丁等都发表了恶毒攻击中国的言论。他们把中国政府平息西藏叛乱说成是“对西藏起义的镇压”，并且搬用卑劣的帝国主义谰言，谩骂“共产党帝国主义已经破坏了西藏的自治”。
    他们还企图在印度人民中煽动敌视中国的情绪，胡说什么“中国人已经动摇了印度人民的太平思想”，“印度对来自北部的对它的安全的威胁不能够继续漠然置之。”他们还编造谎言，制造干涉中国内政的借口，说什么“西藏人的生命的价值已经遭到摧残，在西藏没有个人自由。对于这种事态发展，印度不能继续当沉默的旁观者。”
    萨尼等人还乘机煽动反对印度共产党的情绪，说什么“西藏事件已经确实证明，共产党人是印度的危险”，因此，要反对印度共产党。
    会议通过了“决议”，对达赖喇嘛表示“衷心”的欢迎。
    “决议”居然把西藏说成“国家”，而且对逃到印度的一小撮西藏叛乱分子表示十分“关怀”。决议说，“被迫离开他们出生的国家而且需要避难的那些西藏人将在这个国家（印度）找到避难所。”
    新华社23日讯　新德里消息：印度一些报纸公然主张由印度召集会议来讨论纯属中国内政的西藏问题。这种荒谬的主张充分反映了印度扩张主义者的阴谋和野心。
    21日的“箴言报”公然以干涉者的口吻说，“看来下一个合乎逻辑的步骤是，由印度召集友好的圆桌会议。可以说服中国总理和达赖喇嘛都参加会议”。
    同一天的“甘露市场报”也以同样的口吻放肆地说，“如果北京希望他（达赖喇嘛）回去，而且达赖喇嘛愿意回到拉萨去的话，没有比现在在印度举行谈判更好的时机了”。它说，“现在没有什么东西阻止中国政府同达赖喇嘛建立联系，我们毫不怀疑，尼赫鲁总理将给予建立联系的一切必要的便利。”它还荒谬地竟要中国国家领导人主动去印度参加由“印度赞助”的“谈判”。它狂妄地说，“没有什么东西阻碍周恩来总理访问这个国家”。
    新华社新德里23日电　“印度斯坦旗报”今天在社论中公然提出一个干涉中国内政的方案，说什么西藏问题“的永久性解决必须取决于中国、西藏——以及印度之间三方面取得某种谅解”。
    这篇社论还用威胁性的语调说，“只有使这个问题限于我们三方面中间，而不被容许变为冷战的项目，这种谅解才有可能。中国坚持采取单方面的行动可能造成一种看来矛盾的影响，就是说促使问题朝后者的方向发展”。这篇充满扩张主义气息的社论，还把新华社政治记者关于所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的评论曲解为“是几乎没有掩盖的威吓”。
