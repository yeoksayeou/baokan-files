Gogol's "Tearful Smile"
　　—Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of Gogol's Birth
　　Dong Rongsen

　　"Aren't you also rushing ahead, Russia, like a bold, ever elusive troika? The ground beneath you raises dust; bridges thunder. Everything is left behind you, far, far behind..."
　　"Russia, where are you rushing to? Give an answer! You remain silent. Wonderfully rings the song of the bells. As if shattered by the wind, the air roars, congeals; it rushes past everything that lives and moves on the earth; all other countries and peoples retreat from you, stepping aside to make way."
　　These two paragraphs are from the last page of the first part of Gogol's famous novel "Dead Souls." These magnificent sentences are filled with fantasy about Russia, confidence and hope in the motherland, and what Belinsky called "highly lyrical passion." These sentences are often quoted. Belinsky quoted the entire passage when this great work was published (1842). Qu Qiubai also quoted it when introducing Russian literature (1920-1921). In recent years, people have often quoted it to express their longing for this Soviet land speeding towards communism.
　　Gogol called the novel "Dead Souls" an "epic poem," supposedly intending to compare it to Homer's epic. This work was the harvest of the writer's later years, and he spent sixteen years writing it. The first part was written from 1835 to 1841, taking a total of six years, and was published in 1842. From then on, the writer began writing his second part, until death took his life in 1852, and he did not complete the work. Gogol was born in 1809 (March 20th on the old calendar, i.e., April 1st on the Gregorian calendar), and lived only forty-three years, of which about sixteen years were spent on this work. We Chinese readers are no strangers to Gogol and his "Dead Souls," because we had Mr. Lu Xun's famous translation twenty-four years ago (1935). After Lu Xun translated the first part, he continued to translate the fragments of the second part. He finished translating the third chapter in May 1936 and fell ill. Lu Xun organized this translation while ill and published it in the October issue of "Translation." As Xu Guangping said: "… This unfinished second part of Gogol, the teacher did not complete in translation, which was truly unexpected, or perhaps it can be considered a coincidence."
　　The publication of "Dead Souls" shocked the entire Russia at the time. The author highly summarized the face of an entire era—the serf era. Even today, when we read it, we seem to see the faces of those landlords who bought and sold serfs (called "souls") and lived by exploiting them. At that time, the status and extravagance of the landlords were determined by the number of "souls" they possessed, so there appeared Chichikov, a swindler who specialized in buying "souls" who had already died but had not been deregistered. Gogol's artistic generalization power is very high. Mr. Lu Xun said in an article titled "An Almost Eventless Tragedy": "...The characters created are truly vivid. Even now, even if the times are different and the countries are different, we still feel like we have met some familiar people." The Russian democrat Herzen wrote in his diary: "Gogol's 'Dead Souls' is an amazing book, a painful but not pessimistically desperate condemnation of modern Russia." "His character descriptions are excellent, the breath of life is fully maintained; ... Chichikov's world is melancholy, just as our world is melancholy," he said, only comfort can be found in faith and hope for the future, but "faith is irrefutable, it has a basis in reality."
　　Gogol was born in Ukraine. He himself was a landlord. He initially wrote short stories with Ukraine as the background. In 1836, he wrote the satirical comedy "The Inspector General." Qu Qiubai put it well, "Gogol's style lies in his lively humor. The nature of humor is actually laughter without tears, or so-called 'laughter in tears.'"—This "laughter in tears" is what Lu Xun later called "a tearful smile" in his short essay, a phrase from Pushkin's short commentary on Gogol. Pushkin said that the "Old-Fashioned Landowners" in "Mirgorod" was "a humorous and touching pastoral poem that makes us laugh with sorrowful and sentimental tears." As Lu Xun said: "This 'tearful smile' is already useless in the author's homeland, and healthy laughter is used to replace it." But the characteristics of the old era—the face of the serf era—are forever left to posterity through Gogol's artistic works, allowing posterity to understand more deeply... This is his greatness.
　　"The Inspector General"—there have been no fewer than three or four translations since the May Fourth Movement. The earliest one was included in the Russian Drama Series of the Commercial Press, and new translations have continued to appear. The author's famous short stories, including "The Nose," "The Overcoat," "The Quarrel of the Two Ivans," and "Taras Bulba," which was enthusiastically praised by the Soviet people during the Great Patriotic War, have all been translated into Chinese.
　　Gogol's works show us the bureaucracy, landlord class, and all their ugliness under Tsarist rule. He reveals and satirizes it to his heart's content. He sees only decay in them, but he himself has endless expectations for the future, as seen in the excerpts quoted above. This is also the greatness of this "comedy" writer. A contemporary critic of Gogol said that behind the dead souls in his pen, he felt living souls, which is also what readers feel... This sentence is quite true. The great writer's "tearful smile" has absolutely nothing in common with the vulgar citizens' sad despair. This writer wholeheartedly cares about his motherland and people. He even wrote a book called "Land and People" in 1833, when he was only twenty-four or twenty-five years old, which, according to his own statement, was "a three-volume or two-volume general history and geography." This is a very interesting interlude. Unfortunately, no materials about this book have been preserved, only mentioned in the author's letter to another writer, Pogodin, at the time.
　　Tsar Nicholas forbade any progressive ideas in Russia. The censors under him censored all words with progressive significance, but progressive ideas could not be suppressed. Gogol spread them in his "tearful smile"... This is the reason why his works shook Russia and moved and inspired future generations. (Attached picture)

    果戈里“含泪的微笑”
    ——纪念果戈里诞生150周年
　　栋榕森
    “你不是也在飞跑，俄国呵，好像大胆的，总是追不着的三驾马车吗？地面在你底下扬尘；桥在发吼。一切都留在你后面了，远远的留在你后面。……”
    “俄国呵，你奔到哪里去，给一个回答吧！你一声也不响。奇妙的响着铃子的歌。好像被风所搅碎似的，空气在咆哮，在凝结；超过了凡在地上生活和动弹的一切涌过去了；所有别的国度和国民，都对你退避，闪在一旁，让给你道路。”
    这两段话出自果戈里的著名小说“死魂灵”第一部最后一页。这些奇丽的语句，充满了对于俄罗斯的幻想，对于祖国的自信和希望，充满了别林斯基所谓的“高度的抒情的激情”。这些句子常常为人所引用。别林斯基在这部伟大的作品出世时（1842），整段的引用过。瞿秋白在介绍俄国文学的时候（1920—1921）也引用过。近年来人们为了表达对于这个向着共产主义飞跑的苏维埃国土的憧憬，也常常引用它。
    果戈里把“死魂灵”这部长篇小说称为“长诗”，据说他是意图将它比作荷马的史诗的。这部作品是作家晚年的收获，他用了十六年功夫来写它，第一部写于1835到1841年，总共花了六年，在1842年出版；从此作家开始写他的第二部，一直到1852年死神夺去了他的生命为止，他没有完成这部作品。果戈里生于1809年（旧历3月20日即公历4月1日），活在世上只有四十三年的岁月，其中有十六年左右花在这部作品里。我们中国的读者对于果戈里和他的“死魂灵”是并不陌生的，因为二十四年前（1935）我们就有了鲁迅先生的名译。鲁迅译完第一部以后，接着译第二部的残稿，到1936年5月译完第三章，就病倒了，这份译稿鲁迅曾抱病清理，发表于当年十月的“译文”上，正如许广平所说：……“这果戈里未完成的第二部，先生更在翻译上未为之完成，真非始料所及，或者也算是一种巧合罢。”
      “死魂灵”的出版，震撼了当时整个俄国。作者高度概括了整整一个时代——农奴时代的面貌，直到如今，我们读着它，也仿佛亲眼见到这一批买卖农奴（叫“魂灵”）并靠剥削他们过活的地主们的嘴脸。那时地主是以有多少“魂灵”来定地位的高低、场面的阔窄的，因此就出现了招摇撞骗，专门收买已经死去、但是还未撤销注册的“魂灵”的乞乞科夫。果戈里的艺术概括力量是很高的，鲁迅先生在他的一篇题名为“几乎无事的悲剧”中说：“……那创作出来的脚色，可真是生动极了，直到现在，纵使时代不同，国度不同，也还使我们像是遇见了有些熟识的人物。”俄国民主主义者赫尔岑在自己的日记里这样写道：“果戈里的‘死魂灵’是一本惊人的书，是对于现代俄罗斯的沉痛但并不悲观绝望的谴责。”“他的人物描写非常出色，生命的气息十足地被保持着；……乞乞科夫的世界是忧郁的，正像我们的世界是忧郁的一样”，他说，只能在信仰和对未来的期望中寻找安慰，可是“信仰是无可反驳的，它有现实性的基础。”
    果戈里生于乌克兰，他本身是个地主，他最初写短篇小说，以乌克兰作背景。到1836年写成那部讽刺喜剧“巡按使”。瞿秋白说得好，“果戈里的作风却在于他的活泼的滑稽。滑稽的性质其实是哭不出的笑，或者所谓‘泪里的笑’”。——这“泪里的笑”，即后来鲁迅在他的短文中称为“含泪的微笑”的，语出普希金对果戈里的短评，普希金说“密尔格拉得”中的“旧式的地主”一篇，是“使我们流着忧愁而感伤的眼泪发笑的、戏谑的、动人的田园诗”。正如鲁迅所说：“这‘含泪的微笑’，在作者本土是已经无用了，来代替它的是健康的笑”。但是旧时代的特征——农奴时代的面貌，却通过果戈里的艺术作品，永远留给后人，让后人更加深刻理解……这就是他的伟大处。
    “巡按使”——五四以来有不下三四个译本。最早是编入商务印书馆的俄国戏曲丛刊的一种，后来不断有新的译本出现。作者著名的短篇，包括“鼻子”、“外套”、“两个依凡的吵架”和卫国战争时期苏维埃人所津津乐道的“塔拉斯·布尔巴”，都有了中译本。
    果戈里的作品，给我们显示出沙皇统治下官僚地主阶级和他们的全部的丑恶，他尽情地揭露它，讽刺它，他在他们身上看见的只是腐朽，但是他自己对未来却有无穷的期望，正像上面所举引的片断所见的。这也是这“喜剧”作家的伟大处。果戈里同时代的一个批评家说过，在他笔下的死魂灵后面，他感觉到活的魂灵，这也是读者们所感觉到的……这句话说得颇有道理。伟大的作家“含泪的微笑”跟庸俗市民悲伤的绝望是完全没有共同之处的。这个作家全心全意地关怀着自己的祖国和人民，他甚至在1833年即二十四五岁时还写过一本名叫“地和人”的书，照他自己的说法是“三卷或两卷本的通史和地理”，这是一件很有趣的插曲，可惜的是关于这本书一点材料也没有保存下来，只有在作者给当时另一个作家波哥廷的信里提到而已。
    沙皇尼古拉禁止俄国有任何进步的思想，他手下的检查官把一切有进步意义的字眼都检扣了，但是进步的思想是禁压不住的，果戈里在“含泪的微笑”中给传播了……这是他的作品震撼俄国的原因，也是感动和激励后人的原因吧。（附图片）
