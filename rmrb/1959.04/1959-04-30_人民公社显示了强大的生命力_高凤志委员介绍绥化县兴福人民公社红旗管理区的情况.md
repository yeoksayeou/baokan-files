Comrade Chairman, esteemed delegates, esteemed committee members:

I fully agree with the reports of the leading comrades and will resolutely implement them in my future actions.

1958 was a year of rapid development for our great motherland. In this year, China experienced a great leap forward in all aspects, especially with the output of major industrial and agricultural products such as steel, grain, cotton, and coal increasing many times over. On the basis of the victory of the Party's socialist rectification movement and the great development of industrial and agricultural production, people's communes combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrating government and commune, were universally established throughout the country in just a few months since last summer. This is a great initiative, and it will have extremely significant implications for the development of China's social economy.

Currently, a new, greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward upsurge has formed across the country. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are striving to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959. The 1959 national economic plan discussed at this meeting is a magnificent plan. It is compiled on the basis of fully considering the objective possibilities of China's various material and technical conditions and the subjective initiative of the revolutionary spirit of the people. Therefore, it is practical and can be fully realized. We must continue to go all out, carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and fully tap potential to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the plan. For us farmers, in particular, we must ensure the early and over-fulfillment of various agricultural production targets.

Now, I would like to briefly report to the conference on the situation of the Red Flag Management Area of Xingfu People's Commune in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province.

Our management area, like other fraternal regions across the country, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line and the guidance of Chairman Mao's "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of all commune members, overcame the threats of severe drought and pests, and finally achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain production in 1958. In 1958, the entire management area produced 2.99 million jin of grain, with an average yield of 4,700 jin per hectare, an increase of 76 percent compared to 1957. Based on the total population of the area, the average per capita grain possession was 2,575 jin. In 1958, the entire area completed the state grain procurement of 1.62 million jin, exceeding the quota by 320,000 jin.

On the basis of the great leap forward in agricultural production, our county also quickly realized the people's commune system in less than a month and a half last autumn. Although the people's commune has only been established for a few months, in this short period of time, our vast number of farmers have deeply realized that the people's commune has incomparable superiority over advanced agricultural cooperatives in improving industrial and agricultural production, developing cultural and educational undertakings, and improving people's lives, and it has demonstrated its strong vitality. First of all, in terms of industrial and agricultural production, labor and means of production can be used rationally on a larger scale. Therefore, labor productivity has been greatly improved. At the time of the establishment of the people's commune, our management area was in the tense stage of autumn harvest. Due to the superiority of the people's commune and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, we were able to complete the tense and heavy autumn harvest work, and at the same time, we were able to draw a large number of laborers to support the steel industry, complete 11,000 cubic meters of earthwork and stonework of water conservancy projects, and deep-plow 770 hectares, accounting for 70 percent of the cultivated land area of the entire area. So many heavy tasks were able to be completed simultaneously in such a short period of time, which was unimaginable before communization. Therefore, many commune members said: "Thanks to the establishment of the people's commune, there are more people and more strength, otherwise, so many tasks would be completed to death!"

The establishment of the people's commune has also enabled us to draw some labor and funds to develop industrial production. In accordance with the Party's complete set of two-legged walking policies, the entire area has successively established woodworking factories, clothing factories, and grain processing factories. These factories are gradually developing from small to large. The people's commune has also promoted great development in animal husbandry. The number of pigs in the entire area has increased from 60 in 1957 to more than 400; the number of sheep has increased from 84 in 1957 to 180. In terms of culture and education, a complete primary school has been expanded, an agricultural middle school has been established, and amateur civil schools have been established in various production teams, popularizing compulsory primary education and basically eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. The cultural level of commune members has been greatly improved. The number of children enrolled in school in the entire area has increased from 87 in 1957 to 232, accounting for 98.7 percent of school-age children. Due to the establishment of the people's commune and the bumper grain harvest in 1958, the living welfare of all commune members has been greatly improved. According to the urgent demands of the masses, collective welfare undertakings such as nursery teams, nurseries, and public canteens have been universally established in each production team. Therefore, the vast number of women have been liberated from tedious housework and have been投入production labor. The women are really smiling. Some women even wrote a poem to praise it: "Thanks to the Party's leadership, the commune was established; With a large canteen, women are liberated; Out of the small family, into the big paradise; Mothers are all in the fields, children are collectively looked after; Eating in the canteen, the food is good and the dishes are fragrant; Can have this happiness, thanks to the Communist Party." At the same time, due to the bumper grain harvest, the grain supply system was implemented in the distribution system, which made the vast number of commune members no longer have to worry about eating and burning. Therefore, they have obtained reliable social insurance in their lives. In addition, in terms of wage remuneration, the principle of distribution according to work has been implemented, which has greatly increased the cash income of the vast number of commune members compared to 1957. In 1958, the average income per household in the entire area was 621 yuan (excluding the sideline income of commune members' families), an increase of about 53 percent compared to the average household income of 405 yuan in 1957. With the increase in income, the purchasing power of commune members has also increased. Now, high-quality wool fabric, printed cloth, and rubber shoes and other commodities can not fully meet the needs of the vast number of commune members, and require relevant departments to supply more sweaters, horseshoe watches and other higher-end commodities to rural areas.

These facts make our farmers deeply understand that the reason why agricultural production can increase year by year and our farmers can live a richer life year by year is because the Party and Chairman Mao led us to completely turn over and guide us to the path of collectivization. Therefore, our farmers regard the Party and Chairman Mao as their benefactors. We thank the Party and Chairman Mao. We will always follow the Communist Party and always listen to Chairman Mao. Wherever the Party and Chairman Mao guide us, we will follow.

### 人民公社显示了强大的生命力  高凤志委员介绍绥化县兴福人民公社红旗管理区的情况

    人民公社显示了强大的生命力
    高凤志委员介绍绥化县兴福人民公社红旗管理区的情况主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意各位首长的报告，并在今后实际行动中坚决贯彻执行。
    一九五八年是我们伟大祖国飞跃发展的一年。在这一年里，我国在各个方面都出现了大跃进，特别是钢铁、粮食、棉花、煤炭等主要工农业产品的产量都有了成倍的增长。在党的社会主义整风运动胜利和工农业生产大发展的基础上，去年夏季以来不到几个月的时间内，全国普遍地建立了工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社。这是一个伟大的创举，它对于我国社会经济的发展将具有极为重大的意义。
    目前，一个新的更大、更好、更全面的跃进高潮已在全国范围内形成。全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，正在为实现一九五九年工农业生产更大、更好、更全面跃进而奋斗着。这次会议所讨论的一九五九年国民经济计划正是一个宏伟的计划。它正是在充分的考虑到我国各方面的物质技术条件的客观可能性和人民群众革命干劲的主观能动性的基础上编制出来的。因此，是切实可行，并且可以完全实现的。我们一定要继续鼓足干劲，发扬实干、苦干、巧干的精神，充分挖掘潜力，以保证计划的提前和超额完成。对我们农民来说，特别是要保证农业生产各项指标的提前和超额完成。
    现在我仅将黑龙江省绥化县兴福人民公社红旗管理区的情况向大会作一个简要的汇报。
    我们管理区和全国其他兄弟地区一样，一九五八年在党的总路线的光辉照耀下和毛主席提出的农业“八字宪法”的指导下，由于全体社员发挥了冲天干劲，战胜了严重的干旱和病虫害等威胁，终于取得了粮食生产的空前大丰收。一九五八年全管理区共产粮食二百九十九万市斤，平均每公顷产粮四千七百市斤，比一九五七年提高了百分之七十六，按全区人口计算平均每人占有粮食二千五百七十五市斤。一九五八年全区共完成了国家征购粮一百六十二万市斤，超额完成三十二万市斤。
    在农业生产大跃进的基础上，我县在去年秋天不到一个半月的时间里，也迅速地实现了人民公社化。虽然人民公社成立到现在还只是几个月，可是就在这个短短的时间里，已使我们广大农民深深地认识到，人民公社不论在提高工农业生产、发展文化教育事业或提高人民生活等方面，都比高级农业社有着无比的优越性，显示了它的强大生命力。首先在工农业生产方面，劳动力和生产资料可以在更大的范围内得到了合理的使用。因此，大大的提高了劳动生产率。人民公社成立的当时，我们管理区正处在紧张的秋收阶段，由于人民公社的优越性和群众的冲天干劲，因而使我们得以能够在完成紧张而繁重的秋收工作的同时，还能够抽出大批的劳动力支援了钢铁工业，完成了一万一千立方公尺土石方的水利工程和占全区耕地面积七百七十公顷的百分之七十的深翻地。这么多的繁重任务能够在这样短短的时间里同时完成，这在公社化以前是不可想像的。因此，很多社员说：“多亏成立了人民公社，人多力量大，要不然，那么多的任务累死也完不成啊！”
  人民公社的成立，也使我们能够抽出部分劳动力和资金发展了工业生产。按照党的一整套两条腿走路的方针，全区先后建立了木工厂、被服厂和粮食加工厂等。这些工厂正在由小到大地逐步发展起来。人民公社也促使牧畜业有了很大的发展。全区生猪由一九五七年的六十口，发展到四百多口；羊由一九五七年的八十四只发展到一百八十只。在文化教育方面，扩建了完全小学一所，兴办了农业中学一所，各个生产队也都成立了业余民校，普及了小学义务教育，基本上扫除了青壮年文盲。社员的文化水平有了很大的提高。全区入学儿童由一九五七年八十七名增加到二百三十二名，占学龄儿童的百分之九十八点七。由于人民公社的成立和一九五八年的粮食大丰收，使全体社员在生活福利方面有了很大改善。根据群众的迫切要求，每个生产队普遍地建立了幼儿队、托儿所和公共食堂等集体福利事业。因而使广大妇女从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，投入了生产劳动。妇女们真是喜笑颜开。有的妇女还编了一首诗歌来加以赞扬：“全靠党领导，公社成立了；有了大食堂，妇女得解放；走出小家门，进入大乐园；妈妈都上地，儿童集体看；吃饭进食堂，饭好菜又香；能有此幸福，感谢共产党。”同时，由于粮食大丰收，在分配制度上实行了粮食供给制，这就使广大社员再也不用愁吃愁烧了。因而在生活上获得了可靠的社会保险。加上在工资报酬方面，贯彻了按劳分配的原则，使广大社员的现金收入较一九五七年有了很大的增加。全区一九五八年每户平均收入六百二十一元（不包括社员家庭副业收入），比一九五七年平均每户收入四百零五元增加了百分之五十三左右。随着收入的增加，社员的购买力也提高了，现在质量好的毛布、花布和胶鞋等商品已不能完全满足广大社员的需要了，而要求有关部门向农村多供应些毛衣、马蹄表等较高级的商品。
    这些事实使我们农民深深的懂得，农业生产所以能够逐年增产，我们农民能够过着一年比一年更富裕的生活，是由于党和毛主席领导我们彻底的翻了身，并引导我们走向了集体化道路的结果。因此，我们农民都把党和毛主席看作是自己的恩人。我们感谢党和毛主席。我们要永远跟着共产党走，永远听毛主席的话。党和毛主席引导我们到那里，我们就跟到那里。
