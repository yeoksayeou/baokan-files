    Xinhua News Agency, April 1st, Tokyo dispatch: Tokyo District Court Chief Judge Akio Date today reiterated his view that the presence of U.S. troops in Japan violates the Japanese Constitution, as Article 9 of the Constitution prohibits Japan from possessing any form of war potential.
    In an interview with the Associated Press, Date also said that "the illegality of U.S. troops has also been pointed out in 'An Interpretation of the Japanese Constitution' published by Tokyo University."
    Due to the resolute struggle and strong demands of the Japanese people, the judge of the Tokyo District Court announced on March 30 that the presence of U.S. troops in Japan and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" violate the Japanese Constitution, and therefore ruled seven workers and students who opposed the expansion of the U.S. Tachikawa Air Base in Sunagawa-cho, Tokyo, not guilty. This just verdict has been warmly supported by the Japanese public.
    Yesterday, the Japan Socialist Party requested that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party hold "debate speeches" in various prefectures across the country on this verdict and issues such as the Constitution and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty". The Liberal Democratic Party did not dare to accept this suggestion from the Socialist Party.
    Japanese constitutional expert Isao Sato pointed out: Japan's recognition that the United States can station troops in Japan itself could involve Japan in war. Therefore, Japan's recognition that the United States can station troops in Japan violates the peaceful spirit of Article 9 of the Constitution. Tokujiro Kanamori, Director of the National Diet Library, said in the Diet: Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution prohibits Japan from possessing any war potential.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st, Tokyo dispatch: At the Central Committee meeting held in Tokyo, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations decided to concentrate its efforts on abolishing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and overthrowing the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet.
    The Federation's action plan for this year also stipulates that it will conduct joint struggles with unions such as the Japan Teachers Union and the Japan Coal Miners' Union, and plans to hold rallies and parades in major cities across the country on April 28, and a nationwide strike in mid-May. In addition, it will actively support the struggles of people in various regions against military bases.
    The Federation also issued a statement yesterday supporting the Tokyo District Court's verdict upholding the principles of the Constitution. The statement said that in order to win the final victory, the Federation will launch a more vigorous struggle. (Attached picture)

    东京地方裁判所裁判长重申
    美军驻扎违反日本宪法
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：东京地方裁判所裁判长伊达秋雄今天再次表示，他认为美国军队驻在日本是违反日本宪法的，因为日本宪法第九条规定禁止日本保有任何形式的作战力量。
    伊达在接见美联社记者时还说，“美国军队的非法性在东京大学出版的‘日本宪法的解释’一书中也被指出过”。
    由于日本人民的坚决斗争和强烈要求，东京地方裁判所的这位法官曾经在3月30日宣布美军驻在日本和日美“安全条约”是违反日本宪法的，因而判决反对在东京砂川町扩大美国立川空军基地的七名工人和学生无罪。这个正当的判决受到日本公众的热烈支持。
    日本社会党昨天要求执政的自由民主党同社会党在全国各县就这个判决和宪法、日美“安全条约”等问题举行“辩论演讲会”，自由民主党没有敢接受社会党的这个建议。
    日本宪法专家佐藤功指出：日本承认美国可以驻军日本这件事本身就有可能使日本卷入战争，因此，日本承认美国可以驻军日本这件事是违反宪法第九条的和平精神的。日本国会图书馆馆长金森德次郎在国会里说：日本宪法第九条是禁止日本保有任何作战力量的。
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：全日本学生自治会总联合会在东京召开的中央委员会会议上决定，目前要集中力量争取废除日美“安全条约”和打倒岸信介内阁。
    总联合会决定的今年的运动方针中还规定，要同日本教职员工会和日本煤矿工会等工会进行共同斗争，并且预定4月28日在全国主要城市举行大会和游行，在5月中旬举行全国性罢课。另外，还要积极支持各地人民反对军事基地的斗争。
    总联合会昨天还发表声明，支持东京地方裁判所维护宪法原则的判决。声明说，为了争取最后胜利，总联合会将展开更强有力的斗争。（附图片）
