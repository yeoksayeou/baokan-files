Many facts demonstrate that the "Eight-Character Charter" (soil, fertilizer, water, seed, close planting, protection, tool reform, and field management) is a unified whole and must be comprehensively applied and fully implemented to achieve high-speed development of agricultural production. Under the conditions of abundant fertilizer, sufficient water, and close planting, more attention must be paid to the "protection" aspect (plant protection). It must be understood that the occurrence and decline of plant diseases and insect pests change with the alteration of the surrounding environment. Deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation eliminate many overwintering pests in the soil, weeds, and stubble; however, abundant fertilizer, sufficient water, and close planting also favor the occurrence of pests that prefer shade and moisture. Vigorous crop growth increases resistance to pests; however, from another perspective, the food supply for pests is enriched, reproduction greatly increases, and the period of harm is prolonged. The large-scale outbreaks of rice sheath blight and rice planthoppers in some areas last year, as well as the severity of cotton bollworms and corn borers in the later stages of crop growth, are closely related to these situations.

How much can the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests contribute to a bumper harvest of crops? The Yanbei Prefectural Committee of Shanxi Province once calculated an account: 20% of the cultivated land in this area is planted with potatoes; however, due to the damage caused by late blight, the increase in production has not been significant over the years. In the most severe years of 1953 and 1954, this disease caused a reduction of more than 40%, resulting in a loss of 1.3 billion catties of potatoes, enough to feed the 1.7 million farmers in the region for half a year. Although the natural conditions in 1958 were suitable for the occurrence of late blight, the entire party and all the people mobilized together to resolutely eliminate the disease. Coupled with other production-increasing measures, the potato yield of 1.56 million mu in the region jumped from about 626 catties per mu in 1957 to about 2,200 catties per mu. The Yizhang County Committee of Hunan Province also calculated an account: In 1957, due to the damage caused by rice planthoppers, the county's early rice production was reduced by half, with a yield of only 203 catties per mu, resulting in a loss of 14 million catties of rice. In 1958, the county's first secretary took the lead in vigorously controlling pests, making the county free of rice pests. Coupled with other production-increasing measures, the early rice yield per mu jumped to 824 catties. From this, we can see the great significance of preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests in increasing yield per unit area!

This year's tasks on the agricultural front are very arduous, requiring a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than last year. In accordance with the spirit of "ten-point targets, twelve-point measures, and twenty-four-point effort," even higher and stricter demands must be placed on plant protection work. The comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production requires a comprehensive advance on the plant protection front: not only should we vigorously prevent and control diseases and insect pests of grain and cotton, but also vigorously prevent and control diseases and insect pests of oil crops, hemp, tea, mulberry, fruit trees, vegetables, and other economic crops; not only should we prevent and control diseases and insect pests in farmland, but also prevent and control diseases and insect pests in mountainous and pastoral areas; not only should we prevent and control diseases and insect pests, but also prevent and control bird and animal pests; not only should we defend, but also take advantage of victories to pursue and completely eliminate certain pests, ensuring they never reappear; we must persist in fighting to prevent their resurgence forever.

There are many types of plant diseases and insect pests, and the period of harm is long. Different pests have different harmful habits; crops are vulnerable to pests throughout their entire growth process, from sowing, emergence, flowering, and fruiting to harvesting and storage, from roots, stems, and leaves to flowers and fruits. Therefore, plant diseases and insect pests must be prevented and controlled from before sowing to after harvesting; it is necessary to ensure seedling protection, plant protection, fruit protection, and storage protection, and implement these measures consistently.

Can these requirements be met? The practice of farmers and agricultural scientific and technical workers in our country in 1958 proves that as long as we work hard and skillfully, as long as we launch a massive mass movement, and as long as various measures are closely coordinated, we can greatly expand the results of the struggle against plant diseases and insect pests. In 1958, the area of plant disease and insect pest control in the country expanded by more than one and a half times compared with 1957, and more than 700 counties and cities emerged that basically eliminated one or several diseases and insect pests. In terms of mastering the laws of disease and insect pest occurrence and epidemic, in improving methods of disease and insect pest control, in disease and insect pest forecasting, and in the manufacture of pesticides and the utilization of indigenous pesticides, unprecedented creative efforts were also made in 1958, and great achievements were obtained. For example, wheat rust was previously considered impossible to control with chemicals on a large scale, and could only be prevented by selecting and breeding disease-resistant varieties. Last year, in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, a mass chemical rust prevention campaign was launched on more than 70 million mu of wheat fields. In the campaign, the mass line was followed, and indigenous pesticides that could control wheat stem rust were discovered and widely used. This major innovation in rust prevention technology ensured the bumper wheat harvest in these two provinces last year. For some other plant diseases and insect pests, many more ingenious control methods than in the past were also found last year.

Master the enemy's situation, seize the key, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and attack vigorously and skillfully to eliminate plant diseases and insect pests in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. This is the most important experience of a large number of disease- and insect-free counties and cities last year. Acting according to this experience will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort, achieving both quality and economy.

As the saying goes, "Hit the snake at its vital spot." The seven-inch area from the snake's head is its weakness, and a single blow can be fatal. For each plant disease and insect pest, as long as we grasp the law of its occurrence and growth, we can find its weakness, identify the "vital spot," and achieve the greatest control effect with the least manpower and material resources. For example, locust egg masses hatch successively, and the food intake and diffusion ability of locust nymphs increase with age. If we start too early, a large number of locust nymphs have not yet hatched, and we cannot eliminate their main force, so we have to repeat the treatment; if we start too late, the area of occurrence expands, and the amount of chemicals and labor required will increase a lot. Therefore, for locusts that occur in large areas of wasteland, it is best to control them when most are in the second instar and a small number are in the first or third instar. Grasping this "timing" only requires spraying once to solve the problem. Another example is the formation of rice stem borer damage, which mainly occurs during the tillering stage and from the end of the booting stage to the beginning of the heading stage; during this period, rice is easily invaded by stem borers. Mastering this law, during the period of stem borer occurrence, by ranking the rice fields according to the growth and development of the rice, we can select key fields that are tillering and booting for control, without the need for comprehensive spraying. Last year, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, adopted this method, and in addition to comprehensive control of early japonica rice, the control area for early indica rice and single-season late rice accounted for only 10% of the cultivated area, and double-season late rice was controlled only 20% or so. The average stem borer rate for the county throughout the year was only 0.71%. Another example is wheat stripe rust and potato late blight, which also gradually spread from a very small number of initially infected plants (the so-called "disease centers"). As long as we rely on the masses, conduct regular surveys, and promptly discover and thoroughly eliminate "disease centers," we can prevent the large-scale epidemic of diseases. These are just a few examples. Every plant disease and insect pest has its own special law of occurrence and harmful characteristics, and there are weaknesses to be found; therefore, there are clever battles to be fought for every plant disease and insect pest.

The temperature was higher last winter and this spring, the mortality rate of overwintering pests was low, and activity started earlier. Currently, diseases and insect pests such as rice stem borers, wheat rust, armyworms, cutworms, and cotton aphids have already occurred. We must urgently mobilize to eliminate diseases and insect pests in the early stages of their occurrence, and eliminate them at the most favorable time for control. If this battle is not fought well, diseases and insect pests will spread and diffuse, putting us in a passive situation and costing us a lot of manpower, material resources, and losses. Therefore, all provinces, counties, communes, and teams must quickly strengthen the work of forecasting diseases and insect pests to grasp the enemy's situation. To do this work well, the most important thing is to popularize pest forecasting, hand over pest inspection technology to the masses, and establish pest information networks in the production teams of people's communes, so that the actions of pests are under the surveillance of the broad masses. At the same time, forecasting stations at all levels should increase the objects of forecasting, continuously improve the quality of forecasting, and simplify forecasting methods, so that the leading departments have a clear understanding of the occurrence and decline of diseases and insect pests in the coming period, in order to take the initiative in combat. Doing this will make it possible to fight skillfully and well, and eliminate diseases and insect pests accurately and ruthlessly.

The autumn harvest and spring sowing work in most parts of the country is coming soon. The work of seed disinfection and the use of toxic grains and seed dressing to prevent underground pests must also be arranged quickly to ensure full and vigorous seedlings. The overwintering stage of many diseases and insect pests has not yet ended. In places where the elimination of overwintering diseases and insect pests last winter and this spring was not thorough, we must seize the opportunity to eliminate overwintering pests cleanly and thoroughly. Eliminating diseases and insect pests before they occur is the best strategy for prevention and control. This period is also the season when seeds and seedlings are frequently transported. Quarantine work must also be strengthened to prevent the spread of dangerous diseases and insect pests. For example, last year, Hebei Province imported sweet potato seedlings from the south. Due to negligence in quarantine, the extremely harmful sweet potato weevil, which had never been found in the north before, spread to more than a dozen counties in Hebei. This must be given high attention!

Grasping the enemy's situation is not enough without weapons. To fight skillfully, save labor, and improve efficiency, we must also earnestly prepare for pesticides and machinery. The fact that all localities vigorously developed indigenous pesticides last year and this spring proves that our country's pesticide resources are very rich. The Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes stipulates that pesticide production should be developed in a planned way. All people's communes should actively implement this regulation. Indigenous pesticides are relatively widely distributed, and collection and manufacturing require a certain amount of manpower. Overall consideration and early arrangements should be made. Using appropriate manpower in this area, with sufficient pesticides, will save more manpower in the direct struggle against plant diseases and insect pests. It should also be understood that if there is a shortage of pesticides and crops are damaged, reducing yields, it is a waste of the labor spent on sowing and management. Of course, the role of chemical pesticides should also be fully utilized, and rational and precise use of pesticides should be promoted. At present, the state cannot mass-produce and supply large-scale pesticide application tools. We mainly rely on small-scale ones, and we must also rely on everyone to create better new tools. The reform of pesticide application tools is an important item in the reform of agricultural tools, and leadership must be effectively strengthened. Relevant agricultural tool reform exhibitions and competitions must include it as a key point, and rapidly finalize designs for promotion. Damaged pesticide application tools should be repaired as soon as possible; and more pesticide application tools should be manufactured.

In most areas, generally speaking, there is more experience in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests of grain and cotton, and less experience in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests of oil crops and other economic crops; there is more experience in old cotton areas, and less experience in new cotton areas; there is more experience in fighting hard battles, and less experience in fighting clever battles. The key to solving these problems is to follow the mass line, mobilize the masses in various places to teach and learn from each other, visit and compare, summarize and exchange past experiences, and vigorously carry out publicity, education, and technical instruction on the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, so that the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests becomes a mass movement like "eliminating the four pests." We must strive to ensure that every member of the people's commune knows the significance of preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests and the control methods for the main local diseases and insect pests. Each production team should have some people who achieve "three understandings and four competencies": understand the morphological characteristics of diseases and insect pests, understand the growth and development stages of crops, and understand the symptoms of crop damage; be able to inspect insects, be able to mix and apply pesticides, be able to repair machinery, and be able to use control methods. If every people's commune establishes such a mass-based crop protection "Red Guard" team with both revolutionary drive and scientific and technological knowledge, the victorious completion of the task of eliminating plant diseases and insect pests will have the most reliable guarantee.

### 猛攻巧打病虫害

    猛攻巧打病虫害
    许多事实都说明：“八字宪法”是统一的整体，必须综合运用，全面执行，才能高速度地发展农业生产。在肥多、水足、密植的条件下，对于“保”字（植物保护）不能不更加注意。要知道：病虫害的发生和消长，是随着周围环境的改变而改变的。深耕和积肥消灭了许多土壤中的、杂草中的和根茬中的过冬病虫；但是，肥多、水足、密植，也有利于喜欢阴蔽和潮湿的病虫发生。作物生长旺盛，增加了对病虫的抵抗能力；但是，从另一角度看，病虫的食料丰富了，繁殖力大增，为害时期也延长了。去年一些地区水稻纹枯病、稻飞虱大发生，棉铃虫、玉米螟在作物生长后期仍然十分严重，就同这些情况密切有关。
    防治病虫害对于农作物的大丰收能起多大作用呢？山西省雁北地委曾经算了一笔账：这个地区有20％的耕地面积是种的马铃薯；但因晚疫病为害，历年来增产幅度都不大。最严重的1953、1954两年，因这种病害减产40％以上，损失马铃薯十三亿斤，足够全区一百七十万农民的半年口粮。1958年的自然条件虽然适宜于晚疫病发生，但由于全党全民一齐动员，坚决扑灭了晚疫病，再加上其他增产措施，全区一百五十六万亩马铃薯，由1957年的亩产六百二十六斤一跃而为亩产二千二百斤左右。湖南省宜章县委也算过一笔账：这个县1957年因稻飞虱为害，全县早稻减产一半，亩产仅二百零三斤，损失稻谷一千四百万斤。1958年，由县委第一书记挂帅，大力治虫，成为水稻无虫害县，加上其他增产措施，早稻亩产量一跃而达到八百二十四斤。从这里就可以看到，防治病虫害对于提高单位面积产量有多么重大的意义！
    今年农业战线上的任务是十分艰巨的，要求比去年有更大、更好、更全面的跃进。按照“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”的精神，对植物保护工作也就不能不提出比以往更高、更严格的要求。农业生产的全面跃进，要求植物保护战线全面进军：不仅要大力防治粮食和棉花的病虫害，还要大力防治油料作物、麻类、茶、桑、果树、蔬菜以及其他经济作物的病虫害；不仅要防治农田病虫害，还要防治山区、牧区病虫害；不仅防治病虫害，还要防治鸟兽害；不仅要防守，还要乘胜追击，对某些病虫做到彻底肃清、绝子绝孙，要坚持战斗，让它永不复生。
    病虫害的种类多、为害时期长，不同病虫又有不同的为害习性；农作物在整个生长过程中，从播种、出苗、开花、结实一直到收割、储藏，从根、茎、叶到花、果，都会碰到病虫为害。因此，从播种前到收获后，都要防治病虫害；要做到保苗、保株、保实、保仓，贯彻始终。
    这些要求能不能达到呢？1958年我国农民群众和农业科学技术工作人员的实践证明，只要苦干加巧干，只要大搞群众运动，只要各项措施紧密配合，就能大大扩大对病虫害作斗争的战果。1958年，全国病虫害防治面积比1957年扩大了一倍半以上，出现了七百多个基本上消灭一种或几种病虫的县、市。在掌握病虫发生和流行规律方面，在改进防治病虫的方法方面，在病虫预测预报方面，在农药制造和土农药利用方面，1958年也作了前所未有的创造性的努力，得到了巨大的成就。例如，小麦锈病过去被认为是不可能在大面积上用药剂防治的，只能依靠选育抗病品种的方法来防。去年，在江苏、安徽两省，在七千多万亩麦田上开展了群众性的药剂防锈运动，在运动中走群众路线，发现了而且大量利用了能防治小麦秆锈病的土农药。锈病防治技术的这个大革新，保证了去年这两省小麦的大丰收。对其他一些病虫害，在去年也找到不少比过去更巧妙的防治方法。
    掌握敌情，抓住关键，土洋结合，猛攻巧打，就能多、快、好、省地消灭病虫害。这是去年大批无病虫害的县、市的一条最重要的经验。根据这条经验办事，必能事半功倍，又好又省。
    正如俗话所说的：“打蛇要打在七寸上”。蛇头七寸之处，正是它的弱点，一击可以致命。对于每一种病虫害，只要掌握住它的发生和生长的规律，就能找出它的弱点，看准“七寸”所在之处，用最少的人力物力取得最大的防治效果。例如：蝗虫的卵块是陆续孵化的，蝗蝻的食量和扩散能力是随着龄期的增大而增大的。如果动手早了，大批蝗蝻还没有孵化出土，消灭不了它的主力，须得重复再治；如果动手晚了，发生面积扩大，药剂和劳力都要增加很多。因此，对于发生在大片荒原里的蝗虫，最好在大部分是二龄、小部分是一龄或三龄时动手除治。抓住这个“火候”，只须喷一次药就可以解决问题。再如水稻螟害的形成，主要是在分蘖期和孕穗末期到抽穗初期；在这时期，水稻易被螟虫侵入。掌握了这个规律，在螟虫发生期间，根据水稻生长发育情况，把稻田排一下队，就可以在正在分蘖和孕穗的稻田中挑选重点防治，而不需要全面打药。湖北孝感县去年采取这个办法，除早粳全面防治外，早籼、一季晚稻防治面积仅占栽培面积的10％，双季晚稻也不过防治了20％左右，全县全年螟害率平均只有0.71％。再如小麦条锈病、马铃薯晚疫病，也是先由极少数最先染病的植株（即所谓“发病中心”）逐渐蔓延开来的。只要依靠群众，随时普查，及时发现和彻底地消灭“发病中心”，就可以防止病害大流行。这里所说的只是几个例子。每一种病虫都有它的特殊的发生规律和为害特性，也都有弱点可寻；因此，对每种病虫害都有巧仗可打。
    去冬今春气温较高，越冬病虫死亡率低，活动较早。目前，水稻螟虫、小麦锈病、粘虫、地老虎、棉蚜等病虫害都已发生。必须紧急动员起来，把病虫害消灭在初发生阶段，消灭在防治的最有利时机。这一仗打不好，病虫就会蔓延扩散，使我们陷于被动局面，要多费许多人力物力，多受许多损失。因此，各省各县各社各队要赶紧加强病虫预测预报工作，掌握敌情。要做好这个工作，最重要的是做到测报工作群众化，把病虫检查技术交给群众，在人民公社各生产队普遍建立病虫情报网，使病虫害的一举一动都置于广大群众的监视之下。同时，各级预测预报站要增加预测对象，不断提高预测质量，简化预报方法，使领导部门对于未来一段时期的病虫发生消长情况心中有数，以便主动作战。做到这一点，就可能打得巧、打得好，既准又狠地消灭病虫害。
    全国大部分地区的秋收作物春播工作即将到来。种子消毒和使用毒谷、拌种等办法防治地下害虫的工作也要赶快安排，以保证苗全、苗旺。许多病虫的越冬阶段尚未结束，在去冬今春消灭越冬病虫害不彻底的地方，要抓紧时机，干净、彻底地消灭过冬病虫。把病虫消灭在发生以前，是防治病虫害的上策。这个时期，也正是种子和苗木调运频繁的季节。检疫工作也必须加强，以防止危险病虫的传播。例如，去年河北省从南方调进甘薯种苗，因疏于检疫，使北方过去从未发现的、为害极其严重的甘薯小象鼻虫蔓延到河北的十多个县。对于这一点，必须高度注意！
    掌握了敌情，空手上阵也不行。要打得巧，要节省劳动力和提高效率，还必须切实做好药械准备工作。去年和今春各地大搞土农药的事实证明，我国的农药资源是十分丰富的。党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议中规定，要有计划地发展农药生产。各个人民公社都应该积极地执行这个规定。土农药的分布比较广，采集和制造需要一定的人力，要通盘考虑，及早安排。在这方面用适应的人力，药剂充足了，就会在与病虫害直接斗争中节省更多的人力。还要了解到，如果缺少农药，作物受害减少收成，那才是白白地浪费了许多在播种、管理等方面所费的劳动力。当然，也要充分发挥化学农药的作用，提倡合理用药、精细用药。目前，国家还不能大量生产和供应大型的施药工具，主要还是靠小型的，还要靠大家创造更好的新工具。施药工具的改革是农具改革的重要项目之一，必须切实加强领导。有关农具改革的展览会、评比会，都要把它列为重点之一，迅速定型推广。已经损坏的施药工具，要及早修理好；并且要更多地制造施药工具。
    在大部分地区，一般说来，对于粮棉病虫害的防治经验较多，对于油料和别的经济作物的病虫害的防治经验较少；老棉区的防治经验较多，新棉区的经验较少；打硬仗的经验较多，打巧仗的经验较少。解决这些问题的关键还是走群众路线，发动各地群众互教互学，参观评比，总结交流过去的经验，大张旗鼓地开展防治病虫害的宣传教育和技术传授工作，使防治病虫害成为“除四害”那样的群众性的运动。要力求做到人民公社每一个社员都知道防治农作物病虫害的意义和当地主要病虫害的防治方法。每个生产队都要有一部分人做到“三懂四会”：懂病虫形态特征，懂作物生长发育阶段，懂作物被害症状；会查虫，会配药打药，会修理器械，会防治方法。每个人民公社都建立起来这样一支既有革命干劲又懂科学技术的群众性的保护作物的“赤卫队”，消灭病虫害的任务的胜利完成就有了最可靠的保证。
