　　Reed Grass for Water and Soil Conservation
    Selecting superior pasture grass is of utmost importance for afforesting barren mountains, resolving feed, fertilizer, and fuel issues in mountainous areas, and conserving water and soil. It directly impacts the speed of soil and water conservation and the development of diverse economies in mountainous regions.
    Based on our station's purposeful observations and investigations in the Bagou area of the Hongqi People's Commune in Huangzhong County, it has been proven that reed grass is a type of grass with economic value and strong water and soil conservation capabilities. Reed grass, locally known as "Xiji," belongs to the Gramineae family, genus *Phragmites*. The average plant height of reed grass in grasslands is generally 113 centimeters, with thick, stiff, smooth, and upright stems. The roots are fibrous, generally about 50 millimeters long.
    According to surveys, reed grass is a highly resilient, adaptable, drought-resistant, and alkali-tolerant herbaceous plant. It can thrive even when other plants grow poorly or cannot grow at all, displaying lush foliage. It sprouts and grows as soon as the ground thaws in early spring, demonstrating strong adaptation to the local harsh cold. Here, it generally blooms from mid-July to early August, with seeds maturing and falling off in mid-September.
    Because it is a perennial clump-forming herb, each clump has a large number of plants, often dozens or more. Moderate-growth reed grass often provides over 95% ground cover per clump, and the root system is extensively distributed in the soil. Especially in the soil layer about 25 centimeters deep, there are numerous fibrous roots that crisscross, tightly binding the soil, providing good soil fixation and increasing ground cover. Reed grass primarily reproduces sexually through seeds, but it can also be propagated by transplanting existing grass. Sowing time is divided into autumn sowing and spring sowing. Autumn sowing can be done from mid-September until the soil freezes, while spring sowing should be done early, from when the soil thaws until early May. For transplanting, holes can be dug and plants moved after rain.
    Reed grass has high economic value and is also good fodder for livestock. Livestock readily eat it in its tender, young stage before heading, but after maturity, livestock sometimes only graze on the panicles. According to "Pasture and Grassland Science," reed grass contains 14.21% protein and 46.1% soluble carbohydrates. The stems and leaves of reed grass can also be used to weave baskets, make back baskets, brooms, and other production and daily necessities, and can also be used in mud houses and papermaking.

　　蓄水保土的芨芨草
    选择优良的牧草，对荒山绿化、解决山区的饲料、肥料和燃料及蓄水保土有极其重要的意义，它将直接影响山区水土保持的速度和多种经济的发展。
    依据我站在湟中县红旗人民公社坝沟内有目的观察调查，证明芨芨草是一种有经济价值和蓄水保土能力较强的草种。芨芨草，土名席芨，为禾本科、芨芨草属的一种。芨芨草在草地平均株高一般为一百一十三公分，茎杆粗硬，光滑直立，根为须根，一般长约五十公厘。
    据调查，芨芨草是一种生活力很强、适应性广、耐干旱、耐碱的草本植物。它能在其它植物生长不良或不能生长情况下而茎叶茂盛。每当早春大地解冻后，它就萌发生长，对本地严寒有极强的适应性。在这里，一般7月中旬至8月初开花，9月中旬种子成熟脱落。
    因它系多年生丛生草本，每丛株数极多在数十株以上，中等长势的芨芨草每丛对地面的被复度常达95％以上，土内根系分布极广，尤其是在深约二十五公分的土层须根极多，纵横交切，使土壤紧密结合，具有良好的固定土壤、增加地面被复的作用。芨芨草主要依靠种籽进行有性繁殖，但也可以利用现有草的移植繁殖。播种时间分秋播与春播两种。秋播时间可在9月中旬以后至土壤结冻时，春播宜早；在土壤解冻后至5月上旬。用移植的方法，可利用雨后挖穴移入。
    芨芨草的经济价值很高，也是牲口的好饲料，在抽穗前，幼嫩时期牲口很喜食，成熟后牲口有时只掠食穗头。据“畜牧草学各论”记载，芨芨草含蛋白质14.21％，可溶性碳水化合物46.1％。芨芨草的茎叶还能编筐、做背斗、扫帚等生产生活用品，还可以用于泥房、造纸等。
