    Dirty Legacy
    Fang Cheng
    I felt extreme anger after seeing the cartoons attacking our country and insulting our leaders published in some reactionary Indian newspapers!
    The expansionists in India have inherited a dirty legacy from British imperialism, and their kept "cartoonists" are no exception. The two cartoons reprinted by the "People's Daily" on the 27th are powerful illustrations of this.
    Ever since imperialism invaded China, they have labeled China as "barbaric." In the cartoons published in the imperialist press, the most obvious characteristic representing China's image is "barbarism." We Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, drove out the imperialist forces, and our country was liberated. The country began to become prosperous, and the people's lives improved day by day. However, in the imperialist cartoons, China has become even more "barbaric." Carrying out land reform is "barbaric," suppressing rebellions is "barbaric," and fighting back against American aggressors is still "barbaric." Even measures to vigorously carry out socialist construction and improve people's lives are labeled as "barbaric." In short, anything that touches imperialism and reactionaries, anything that makes imperialism and reactionaries unhappy, is nothing but "barbaric." Didn't British imperialism recently scold the people of Nyasaland who are fighting for national independence as "barbaric"! This is the logic of the imperialists, which is also a legacy inherited by the Indian expansionists. These two cartoons that insult our country as "barbaric" are full of this stuff. We have seen countless works like this in the imperialist press, and we are not surprised at all.
    The cartoon in the "Times of India" even slanders our country for undermining the principles of peaceful coexistence. Who is actually undermining it? China has never interfered in India's internal affairs. We have no "special interests" on Indian territory, and we have no intention of dividing any part of India to make it "independent." We have not engaged in defamation and personal attacks against the Indian government and national leaders - we have never done such a thing. Even when Indian expansionists were frantically slandering and insulting our country, we repeatedly emphasized maintaining Sino-Indian friendship and the principles of peaceful coexistence. But, looking back at these two cartoons, Tibet is our country's territory, which no one can deny. According to the principles of peaceful coexistence, foreigners should not interfere in our internal affairs. However, the author of the cartoon interfered, falsely accusing our government of suppressing a small group of rebels as "barbaric" behavior towards Tibet, and engaging in personal attacks and insults against our national leaders, attempting to incite hostility towards the Chinese people among the Indian people. Where is there any "peaceful coexistence" in all of this? Now they are "spewing blood" and falsely accusing us of undermining the principles of "peaceful coexistence." This is a clumsy trick of imperialist propaganda. What glory is there in inheriting it for you - Indian expansionists and their accomplices!

    肮脏的遗产
    方成
    看了印度一些反动报纸刊登的攻击我国、侮辱我国领袖的漫画，感到极大的愤怒！
    印度的扩张主义分子们从英帝国主义手里承受了一份肮脏的遗产，他们豢养的“漫画家”也不例外。“人民日报”27日转载的两幅漫画，就是有力的说明。
    自从帝国主义侵入中国以后，中国就被它们扣上一顶“野蛮”的帽子。在帝国主义报刊上登出的漫画里，代表中国的形象最显明的特点就是“野蛮”。我们中国人民在中国共产党领导下，把帝国主义势力赶走以后，我国才获得解放，国家开始走向富强，人民生活一天天美好起来。而在帝国主义的漫画里，中国就变得越发“野蛮”了。进行土地改革是“野蛮”，平息叛乱也是“野蛮”，反击美国侵略者还是“野蛮”，甚至大力进行社会主义建设，改善人民生活的措施也被扣上“野蛮”的帽子。总而言之凡是触到帝国主义和反动派，使帝国主义和反动派不高兴的事，就没一件不是“野蛮”的。最近英帝国主义不是还骂争取民族独立斗争的尼亚萨兰人民是“野蛮”吗！这就是帝国主义者的逻辑，也就是印度扩张主义分子所承受的一项遗产。辱骂我国是“野蛮”的这两幅漫画里就充满了这种东西。像这样的作品，我们已经从帝国主义报刊上看了不知多少，一点也不觉得奇怪。
    “印度时报”的那幅竟诬蔑我国破坏和平共处的原则。到底谁在破坏它呢？中国从来没有干涉过印度内政，在印度国土上我们没有任何“特殊利益”，更没有打算分割印度哪一块领土，要它“独立”；对印度政府和国家领袖没有进行过诽谤和人身攻击——这种事我们从来不干的。甚至在印度扩张主义分子对我国进行疯狂诽谤和辱骂的时候，我们还一再强调维护中印友好和和平共处原则。可是，回过来看看这两幅漫画吧。西藏是我国领土，这是谁也不能否认的。按照和平共处原则，外国人就不该干涉我国内部事务，然而漫画的作者竟来干涉了，把我国政府平息一小撮叛匪诬蔑为对西藏的“野蛮”行为，对我国家领袖进行人身攻击和侮辱，企图在印度人民中间煽动敌视中国人民的情绪。所有这一切，那有一点“和平共处”的味道？现在他们“血口喷人”，反而诬蔑我们破坏“和平共处”原则，这是帝国主义宣传的拙劣惯技，你们——印度扩张主义分子及其走卒承受下来又有什么光采呢！
