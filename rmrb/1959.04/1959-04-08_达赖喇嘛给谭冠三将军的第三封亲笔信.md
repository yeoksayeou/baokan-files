    The Dalai Lama's Third Personal Letter to General Tan Guansan
    The Dalai Lama's third personal letter to General Tan Guansan, dated March 16. This letter was also written in pencil. The original is 27.3 cm long and 21.2 cm wide.
                  The full Chinese translation of the letter is as follows:
    Dear Comrade Political Commissar Tan:
    Your letter of the 15th was received just now at three o'clock. I am very pleased and thankful for your concern for my safety.
    The day before yesterday, on the 5th day of the Tibetan calendar's second month, I spoke to more than 70 representatives of government officials and others, educating them from all aspects to carefully consider the current and long-term stakes and interests, and to settle down. Otherwise, my life will certainly be in danger. After such stern accusations, the situation has improved slightly. Although the situation inside and outside here is still very difficult to handle, I am using clever methods to internally divide the government officials into two types of people: progressive and those who oppose the revolution. Once, after a few days, there is a certain amount of reliable strength, I will take a secret way to the military region, and I will send you a letter in advance. Please also take reliable measures on your end. Please send letters often with your opinions.
      Respectfully, Dalai, 16th

    达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的第三封亲笔信
    达赖喇嘛3月16日给谭冠三将军的第三封亲笔信。这封信也是用铅笔写的。原件长二十七公分三，宽二十一公分二。
                  全信汉文译文如下：亲爱的谭政委同志：
    你15日的来信，方才三点钟收到。您对我的安全甚为关怀，使我甚感愉快，谢谢。
    前天藏历2月5日我向政府官员等的代表七十余人讲话，从各方面进行了教育，要大家认真考虑目前和长远的利害关系，安定下来，否则我的生命一定难保。这样严厉地指责之后，情况稍微好了一些。现在此间内外的情况虽然仍很难处置，但我正在用巧妙的办法，在政府官员中从内部划分进步与反对革命的两种人的界线。一旦几天之后，有了一定数量的足以信赖的力量之后，将采取秘密的方式前往军区，届时先给您去信，对此请您亦采取可靠的措施。您有何意见，请经常来信。
      达赖16日呈
