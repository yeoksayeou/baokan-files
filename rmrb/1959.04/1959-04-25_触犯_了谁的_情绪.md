    Who's "Emotions" Have Been "Offended"?
    Xie Fan
    After the Xinhua News Agency's political reporter's "Comment on the so-called 'Dalai Lama's Statement'" exposed the statement's riddled with loopholes with conclusive evidence, certain expansionist elements in India immediately became embarrassed and enraged, clamoring loudly. The editor of the "Hindustan Times" even openly threatened in the weekly commentary column: "The Chinese cannot risk offending Indian emotions simply because they fabricated the abduction story they are now insisting on." Look at his pompousness; how intimidating! However, who can be intimidated by this ridiculous posture? What exactly does this editor mean by "offending emotions"? If he is referring to "offending" the emotions of the genuine Indian people, then such a clumsy lying trick is too clumsy. The Indian people know very well that the Chinese people have never selfishly "offended" the Indian people, and that the friendship between the one billion Chinese and Indian people is of great significance for peace in Asia and the world. If he is referring to "offending" the emotions of those Indian expansionist elements who are frantically clamoring about our country's Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our internal affairs, then this editor's intimidation is precisely a guilty conscience. In fact, aren't they the ones who have madly insulted the Chinese people? They have inherited the mantle of British imperialism, engaged in conspiratorial activities using the Tibetan rebellion, and interfered in our internal affairs. They are the ones who have offended the emotions of the Chinese people. We want to solemnly tell this editor that the Chinese people will never allow any country or any foreign forces to interfere in our internal affairs, no matter where this interference comes from.
    It is universally known that "Panchsheel," the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, is based on "mutual respect for territorial sovereignty," "mutual non-aggression," and "mutual non-interference in internal affairs." Do the Indian expansionist elements' frantic clamoring about the Tibetan rebellion and their collusion with the Tibetan rebels have even a little bit of the flavor of friendship? Who exactly is offending whose emotions? If the Chinese people's long-endured counterattack has "offended" their "emotions," then the Chinese people will not only "risk offending" their "emotions," but also tear off their masks and expose all their ugly possessions, letting the people of the world see what kind of shady dealings these fellows are engaged in.

    “触犯”了谁的“情绪”
    谢帆
    当新华社政治记者的“评所谓‘达赖喇嘛的声明’”以确凿的证据揭露了这篇声明的千疮百孔的漏洞以后，印度的某些扩张主义分子们立刻就羞恼成怒，大肆叫嚣，“印度斯坦时报”的主编甚至在每周评论栏里公开恐吓说：“中国人不能仅仅因为制造了他们现在坚持到底的关于劫持的说法，而冒触犯印度情绪的危险”，你看他大言不惭，说得好不吓人！可是，这种可笑的姿态能够吓倒谁呢？这位主编先生所谓的“触犯情绪”究竟是何所指？如果他所指的是“触犯”了真正印度人民的情绪，那么，这样的撒谎伎俩也未免太拙劣了。印度人民知道得很清楚：中国人民从来没有去损人利己地“触犯”过印度人民，而中印十亿人民的友好，对于亚洲和世界的和平，又有多么重大的意义。如果他所指的是“触犯”了借我国西藏叛乱事件而疯狂叫嚣，干涉我国内政的印度扩张主义分子们的情绪，那么，这位主编先生的恐吓，正是作贼心虚，事实上不正是他们丧心病狂地侮辱了中国人民，他们继承了英帝国主义的衣钵，借西藏叛乱事件搞阴谋活动，干涉我国内政，正是他们触犯了中国人民的情绪。我们要正告这位主编先生，中国人民绝不能允许任何国家，任何外国势力干涉我国的内政，不管这种干涉来自何方。
    举世周知，“潘查希拉”，有名的和平共处的五项原则，是建立在“互相尊重领土主权”、“互不侵犯”、“互不干涉内政”的基础上的，印度的扩张主义分子们对于西藏叛乱事件的疯狂叫嚣，和西藏叛乱分子勾勾搭搭的阴谋活动，有一点点朋友的味道吗？究竟是谁触犯了谁的情绪？如果说中国人民容忍了很久的反击“触犯”了他们的“情绪”，那么，中国人民岂只是要“冒触犯”“情绪”的“危险”，而且要撕破他们的假面具，把他们的丑恶家当全部抖出来，让全世界人民看一看这些家伙在干着什么样的见不得人的勾当。
