Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 10th: After the consolidation of the Taiping People's Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, a scene of everyone caring, everyone offering ideas, careful calculation, diligence and thrift, and working together with one heart to vigorously engage in spring plowing and sowing has emerged. Stepping into the fifty-li long ridge within the commune's boundaries, fertilizer transport vehicles shuttle back and forth on the main and small roads; plowing oxen and plows are everywhere in the cotton and grain fields; the caked clay soil, after repeated deep plowing and fine harrowing, has become loose and flat, and the sowing of cotton and miscellaneous grain crops has begun.

This area has always been a low-yielding area with more land and less labor, and extensive cultivation. Now, people are determined to change this low-yielding situation. First, they grasped the rational allocation of labor and the reform of production tools to gradually solve the difficulty of insufficient labor. Recently, after rational arrangements, the number of people invested in spring plowing and sowing throughout the commune has increased to more than 32,000. Some elderly people and children also actively requested to work during the busy farming season, and the production team has assigned them some tasks suitable for their physical strength. Everyone in the commune is working hard, and everyone is finding tricks, and labor productivity has greatly improved compared to before. The fertilizer transportation work of the entire commune has basically realized vehicle-ization. More than 8,000 large and small vehicles have launched a competition for "fast loading, heavy loading, and fast running." The daily work efficiency has generally increased from 20-30 vehicles to 60-70 vehicles. After the Lake and River Management District implemented the method of fixed quality, fixed quantity, and fixed rewards, the efficiency of plowing increased. The average daily plowing area per plow increased from 1.7 mu to 2.8 mu, and the plowing depth increased from 5 inches to 7-8 inches.

All production teams actively repaired production tools and promptly added a batch of new tools according to the needs of their teams. In March, the entire commune repaired about 20,000 various tools and added more than 10,000 large and medium-sized new tools. Wang Minghua, the captain of the Xinghuo Brigade, personally led nine carpenters and repaired ten double-furrow plows and fifteen sprayers in one day. After implementing the principles of unified leadership, decentralized management, and running the commune diligently and thriftily, the cadres and members of each team actively used their brains, extensively tapped potential, and found tricks. In the manure accumulation campaign, after pooling wisdom, a total of 25 ways to accumulate manure were found, accumulating more than 4 million carts of natural fertilizer (each cart is equivalent to about 10 dan), and manufacturing 9 million jin of local chemical fertilizer. The Lake and River Management District also built a public toilet for every 100 mu of cultivated land to solve the problem of topdressing crops in the future. In addition to ordering some pesticides, the production teams are rushing to manufacture local pesticides. Zhou Jinshuo, the accountant of the Third Team of the Red Flag Brigade, came up with the idea of ​​washing the pesticide jars and bottles used last year. He brushed 100 jin of DDT from 28 old DDT jars and 60 ml of "1605" from 12 old "1605" bottles. Zhou Jinshuo's spirit of running the commune diligently and thriftily has been praised by the commune party committee.

Now, the commune is closely combining the current spring plowing and sowing activities to further mobilize the masses, continue to deeply implement the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, and at the same time actively establish and improve various production management systems based on the principles of unified leadership and decentralized management.

　　枣阳县太平公社春耕春播一片新景象
　　队队克勤克俭人人同心合力
　　各个生产队纷纷开动脑筋集思广益挖掘生产潜力
    新华社武汉10日电　湖北枣阳县太平人民公社在整社以后，出现了人人操心，个个献计，精打细算，克勤克俭，同心合力大闹春耕春播的景象。走进这个公社范围的五十里长岗，大路小路，运肥车辆往来如梭；棉田粮田，耕牛犁犋遍地走；板结的粘性土壤，经过三番四复的深耕细耙，已经变得松软而平整，开始了棉花和杂粮作物的播种工作。
    这里是土地多，劳力少，一向耕作粗放的低产地区。现在，人们决心要改变这种低产的面貌。首先抓住合理安排劳动力和改革生产工具，逐步解决劳力不足的困难。最近经过合理安排，全社投入春耕春播的人数增加到了三万二千多人。一些老年和少年儿童，在农忙中也主动要求出勤，生产队已分配一些适合他们体力的事情做。全社人人鼓干劲，个个找窍门，劳动生产效率较前大大提高了，全公社的运肥工作，基本上实现了车子化，八千多辆大小车辆，展开了“快装、多载、快跑”的评比竞赛，每日工效一般由二、三十车提高到六、七十车。湖河管理区实行定质、定量、定奖励的办法后，犁地工效提高了，平均每犋犁每天由耕地一亩七分提高到二亩八分，耕地深度由五寸加深到七、八寸。
    各生产队都积极整修生产工具，并根据本队需要及时添置了一批新工具。全社3月间整修各种工具约两万件，添置大中型新工具一万多件。星火大队队长王明华亲自带领九个木匠，在一天之内就修理好了十部双铧犁和十五部喷雾器。经过贯彻统一领导、分级管理和勤俭办社的原则，各队干部和社员们纷纷开动脑筋，广泛挖潜力，找窍门。积肥运动中，经过集思广益，共找出了二十五种积肥门路，积起了自然肥料四百多万车（每车约合十担），并制造土化肥九百万斤。湖河管理区还在每百亩的耕地面积上新建一所公共厕所，解决今后作物的追肥问题。各生产队除了订购了一部分农药外，正在赶制土农药。红旗大队第三小队会计员周金锁，想法把去年用过的农药坛子和瓶子刷洗一遍，在二十八个滴滴涕的旧坛子里刷出一百斤滴滴涕，在十二个“一六○五”的旧瓶子里刷出六十毫升“一六○五”。周金锁的这种勤俭办社精神，受到了公社党委的表扬。
    现在，这个公社正在密切结合当前的春耕春播活动，进一步地发动群众，继续深入地贯彻勤俭办社的方针，同时积极地根据统一领导、分级管理的原则，建立和健全各项生产管理制度。
