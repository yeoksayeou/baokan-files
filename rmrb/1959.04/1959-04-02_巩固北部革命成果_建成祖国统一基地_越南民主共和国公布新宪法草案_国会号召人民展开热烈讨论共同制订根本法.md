The draft constitution stipulates that the territory of Vietnam is an indivisible and unified whole, bordering the People's Republic of China to the north, facing the sea to the east and south, and connected to Laos and Cambodia to the west. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a people's democratic state based on the worker-peasant alliance, established and consolidated in the victories of the glorious August Revolution and the heroic War of Resistance of the Vietnamese people. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a multi-ethnic country. All ethnic groups living on Vietnamese territory are equal in rights and obligations. All power in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam belongs to the people. The election of deputies to the National Assembly and people's councils at all levels shall be conducted in accordance with the principles of universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage.

The draft constitution stipulates that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam develops and transforms the national economy along the socialist path, gradually moving from the people's democratic system to socialism. The ownership of means of production in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam now mainly includes the following: state ownership, that is, ownership by the whole people; cooperative ownership, that is, collective ownership by the working masses; individual laborers' ownership; capitalist ownership. The state guarantees priority development of the state-owned economy; the state especially encourages, guides, and helps the development of the cooperative economy; the state protects the ownership of means of production and other capital ownership of industrial and commercial capitalists in accordance with the law. The state specifically guides industrial and commercial capitalists to engage in operations that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, conducive to the development of the national economy, and in line with the state's economic plan. The state encourages and guides industrial and commercial capitalists to carry out socialist transformation through state capitalist forms.

The draft constitution makes particularly detailed provisions for the "basic rights and obligations of citizens." According to the provisions, all citizens are equal before the law. Citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of nationality, race, gender, social origin, religious belief, property status, education level, occupation, and length of residence, have the right to vote and stand for election, except for those with mental illness and those who have been deprived of the right to vote and stand for election by the court or law. Women enjoy equal rights with men in political, economic, cultural, and family affairs. Citizens have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and demonstration.

Workers have the right to material assistance in old age, in case of illness, or when they lose their ability to work. Citizens have the right to education. The state protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Vietnamese.

The draft constitution stipulates that citizens of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have the obligation to abide by the constitution, laws, labor discipline, public order, and respect social morality.

The draft constitution stipulates that the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is Hanoi.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 31st: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam recently issued a statement calling on the people of the whole country to enthusiastically participate in the discussion of the draft constitution.

The statement pointed out: The people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are the masters of the country. Therefore, the formulation of the constitution and the discussion of issues related to the national economy and the people's livelihood must be a matter for the whole people.

The statement said: Completely different from the anti-democratic "constitution" designed by U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam, their "constitution" is only drafted by the ruling group, and then they play a trick of having it passed by a so-called "constituent national assembly." The constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is drafted by the true representatives of the people and then submitted to the people for their opinions. The National Assembly will only pass the constitution when it can truly reflect social reality and conform to the wishes of the broad masses.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam once formulated the first constitution in Vietnamese history in November 1946. At the Sixth Session of the National Assembly held in December 1956, it was decided to revise this constitution in accordance with the nature and tasks of the new revolutionary stage in Vietnam, and a Constitution Revision Committee headed by President Ho Chi Minh was established. This committee has revised the current constitution several times based on the opinions of people from all walks of life.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 1st: The Constitution Revision Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam today issued a communique on the promulgation of the draft constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, calling on the people of the whole country to actively participate in the work of formulating a new constitution. The communique pointed out: Participating in the formulation of the constitution is one of the most important rights and obligations of the people. The communique said that only in our system do the people have this right.

The communique said that the broad and in-depth discussion of the constitution by the people is an important step in the process of revising the constitution. The communique said that it will make our constitution faithfully and fully reflect the will and aspirations of our people, and make our constitution truly the people's constitution, formulated by the people and serving the interests of the people.

The communique said that before the draft new constitution was officially promulgated today, opinions were solicited from deputies to the National Assembly and cadres of political parties, government, army, and mass organizations. The Constitution Revision Committee has studied these opinions in detail and reorganized the draft constitution based on these opinions.
