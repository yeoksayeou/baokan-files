    The Whole Family Learns Pinyin Alphabet
    Chen Jin'si, a national advanced worker in socialist construction, is from Wushan Township, Datian County, Fujian Province. In July 1958, when she attended the National Conference for Observing Achievements in Promoting Mandarin Chinese in Beijing, Wu Yuzhang, the Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, introduced her to a teacher of the Pinyin alphabet to teach her Pinyin. During the conference, she made diligent efforts to learn, using the time she had getting up early and going to bed late. In just seven days, she initially learned the Pinyin scheme.
  After Chen Jin'si returned to Wushan Township, she encouraged the whole township to learn the Pinyin alphabet and also encouraged her whole family to learn. Her mother, who was in her fifties, asked her to write the Pinyin alphabet on the table and walls with chalk, learning while doing housework. Even when she went up the mountain to watch the cows during the day, her mother carried the Pinyin alphabet chart with her, learning while watching the cows, and she also led the other three elderly women and a little girl in the cow-watching group to learn the Chinese Pinyin alphabet. Jin'si's father was also very enthusiastic, always learning a little with his wife before and after meals. During breaks from work, they used branches as pens to draw on the ground, squatting by the edge of the field to learn to write. Although his memory was poor, he mastered the Pinyin alphabet through diligent study. Jin'si's sister-in-law was a cook in the commune canteen. She pasted Pinyin alphabets all around the canteen, reciting them while cooking, and always reviewed them once before going to bed at night. When she lay in bed, she also used her fingers as pens and her belly as paper, practicing writing with all her heart. Chen Jin'si's whole family learned the Pinyin alphabet and became a model family for learning the Chinese Pinyin alphabet in the whole township.

    全家学习拼音字母
    全国社会主义建设积极分子陈进四，福建省大田县吴山乡人。1958年7月间到北京参加全国推广普通话成绩观摩大会时，中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章同志介绍了一位拼音字母的教师教她学拼音。会议期间，她利用早起、晚睡的休息时间勤学苦练，仅七天就初步学会了拼音方案。
  陈进四回到吴山乡，就带动全乡学习拼音字母，还带动他家全家人学。她的五十多岁的母亲要她用粉笔把拼音字母写在桌上、壁上，边做家务边学习。就是白天上山看牛，她母亲也随身带着拼音字母表，边看牛边学习，并带动看牛组里另外三个大娘和一个小女孩也学会了汉语拼音字母。进四的父亲劲头也不小，饭前饭后总要和老伴一起学一点。劳动休息时，就用树枝当笔在地上划，蹲在田梗边学写，记忆力虽差，但在勤学苦练下，也掌握了拼音字母。进四的嫂嫂是公社食堂的炊事员，她就在食堂的周围贴满了拼音字母，边煮饭边念，晚上睡觉时总要复习一遍，躺在床上，也还用手指当笔，肚皮当纸，用心练习写。陈进四全家都学会了拼音字母，成了全乡学习汉语拼音字母的模范家庭。
