　　Busy Cultivating Green in the Orange Orchard

　　In Huangyan County, Zhejiang, famous for its honey oranges, the more than 20,000 mu of orange orchards along the banks of the Chengjiang River have already donned a fresh spring green. Tender buds are sprouting uniformly on the orange trees, and flower buds are just beginning to emerge; at the base of the orange trees are piles of fresh soil, mixed with fertilizer; men and women are busily working in the orange orchards, fertilizing, loosening the soil, pruning, and eliminating pests... Comrades are holding up sprayers and spraying "drizzles," carrying with it bursts of fragrance. It turns out they are spraying rosin alkali, which can kill insects.

　　At the end of March, I came to the Huijiang Production Team of the Chengjiang People's Commune. The Huijiang Production Team is a national model unit for high citrus yields. Since the team's Party Branch Secretary and farmer-citrus expert, Zhang Youfa, attended the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, the team members' enthusiasm for production has become even higher. They are accumulating fertilizer day and night, digging ditches in the rain, determined to strive to achieve a "ten thousand jin orange team" this year. Therefore, the honey orange orchard is cultivated very well.

　　A backward orange orchard, under the processing and cultivation of Zhang Youfa and the team members, is now neatly arranged with branches, crisscrossed by new ditches, without a blade of grass in sight, and no insects to be found. Zhang Youfa told me that they have already cultivated twenty mu of backward orange orchards very well, and this year's output can be increased several times.

　　The honey orange output of the Chengjiang People's Commune accounts for more than 90% of the county's total. Recently, all production teams in the commune carried out a major inspection of orange orchard cultivation work. The members are determined to add another push, to do the work of cultivating orange orchards more meticulously, and to use new achievements to welcome the Provincial Citrus Production Conference to be held in Huangyan.

　　桔园春绿培育忙
    在盛产蜜桔的浙江黄岩县，澄江两岸的两万多亩桔园已经披上了春绿新装。桔树上嫩芽齐发，花蕾初吐；桔树下堆堆新土，掺着肥料；桔园里男男女女，忙个不停，施肥、松土、修剪、除虫……。社员们高举喷雾器喷射出“毛毛雨”，传来阵阵香味，原来是喷射能杀虫的松香碱。
    3月底我来到澄江人民公社汇江生产队。汇江生产队是全国柑桔丰产单位，队的党支部书记、农民柑桔专家张友法，不久前出席全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议后，全队社员生产劲头更加高涨，他们日夜积肥，冒雨开沟，决心争取今年实现柑桔万斤队。因此蜜桔园培育得很出色。
    一片落后桔园，在张友法和社员的加工培育下，现在已是枝条整齐、新沟纵横，看不见草，也找不到虫了。张友法告诉我，他们已经把二十亩落后桔园培育得很好了，今年产量可以成倍增加。
    澄江人民公社的蜜桔产量占全县90％以上。最近，全社各个生产队之间开展了一次桔园培育工作大检查，社员们决心再加一把劲，把培育桔园的工作做得更精细，用新的成绩来迎接在黄岩召开的全省柑桔生产会议。
