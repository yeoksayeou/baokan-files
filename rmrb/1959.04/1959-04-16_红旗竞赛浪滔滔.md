　　Red Flag Competition Raging
　　By Our Correspondent Fu Dong
    By chance, I visited the Beijing Brocade Flag Factory.
    Walking into the factory's sales department, three storefronts were filled with shimmering red brocade flags. These flags read: "Awarded to the High-Yield, High-Quality Team," "Presented to the Team Continuously Achieving High-Quality, Rapid Construction Victories..."
    One cadre among the customers said, "Can you find a way to make it even faster? The workers at Youzhou Station on the Fengsha Railway Line are waiting to win this red flag! Before I came, everyone repeatedly urged me to bring the flag back quickly. The competition is fierce, with everyone vying against each other. Previously, a train car would stop at the station for four and a half hours. After launching the red flag competition, it only takes three hours and forty-eight minutes. Everyone says that in April, we need to further reduce the stopping time to three hours... You can imagine, how can I go back empty-handed?"
    As soon as he finished speaking, another person chimed in, "Our trolleybus company also urgently needs a red flag. After the Party Central Committee and the State Council called for a new high tide in production, the bus company challenged us. We want to compete with them, and there's also competition within the company, between teams and individuals. Everyone said at the competition rally that we not only need to ensure that the vehicles are never idle or broken, but also strive to be the best in the country in terms of service attitude."
    As people were talking, a salesman walked out from behind the counter, holding a package in his hand, checking his watch as he walked. He said, "The workers rushed and rushed, and finally got the flag made. There's still an hour before the factory's appraisal and award ceremony, so I'm rushing to deliver it...." He then hurriedly got into a car and left.
    After shaking hands and saying goodbye to the salesman, I was about to leave when I was met by someone. What? It's Lao Li! Lao Li is an old acquaintance, he's a cadre from the trade union of the Iron Smelting Plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. As soon as he saw me, he said enthusiastically, "The competition in the company is even more lively than a few days ago. Everyone has found an opponent. Furnaces versus furnaces, shifts versus shifts, groups versus groups, and people versus people are all competing. The appraisal and flag awarding will be held immediately, so I had to rush into the city to buy flags." He added, "Since April, the company's production has taken a great leap forward. For example, No. 1 Blast Furnace produces more than 100 tons of pig iron every day. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace was only 1.385 in March, but now it has suddenly risen to around 1.6."
    His words reminded me of the scene when I visited Shijingshan Iron and Steel a few days ago. That day, as soon as I arrived at the gate of the Iron Smelting Plant, I saw a large group of people gathered in front of the blackboard bulletin. Comrade Cao Hongsen, a reporter for the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's newspaper, was also in the crowd. They were discussing as they looked, some even taking notes. What were they doing? I went over to take a look and saw a big red couplet posted on it. The upper line was: "Red Flag Competition Raging," the lower line was "Real Heroes Are Seen Today," and in the middle was a large pile of numbers. It turned out that these numbers were a comparison table of production targets for Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, Anshan Iron and Steel, and Shijingshan Iron and Steel. Comrade Cao Hongsen introduced to me that everyone is most interested in this table now. As soon as the new statistics come out, everyone rushes to see it, to see what the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace of the advanced factories is, and how much stronger their smelting intensity and coke ratio are than their own factory. What methods can we use to catch up? Cao Hongsen suggested that I visit the planning department. He said that they have to make phone calls to Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant every ten days. Now the relationship between our iron and steel companies is both tense and close. It's tense because everyone is competing, and it's close because everyone is constantly exchanging new technical experiences. For example, recently Taiyuan Iron and Steel sent us a document telling us how to use water beneficiation to increase the iron content of ore powder. They were so thoughtful that they also attached a drawing. We also sent them our double-row air duct and carbon-rammed furnace lining materials.
    As we talked and walked, we unknowingly came to a large bulletin board with the words "Red Flag Competition Stage" written on it, with many red and yellow big-character posters posted below. It read: "How to use the existing two 84-cubic-meter fans in parallel with the original 104-cubic-meter fan? If the experiment is successful, the smelting intensity can be increased by more than 20%." "How to water-wash Laibin manganese ore"... Next to it, some big-character posters were filled with such sentences as: "Please heroes come on stage to compete," "Please Zhuge Liang advise," "Who can come up with a plan?" I was carefully reading the big-character posters when Ma Shuyuan, the chairman of the trade union, walked over. He said that these are the twenty-four keys to increasing pig iron production. Then he said that it was a pity that I wasn't there on the 31st of last month, because that scene was really lively. That morning, as soon as we hung up these twenty-four production key signs, it wasn't long before someone came knocking on gongs and drums to take the signs, saying that after discussion and research by their team, everyone believed that they could find a way to solve the problem of increasing smelting intensity. After a while, another team came and said that they could guarantee that they could take down the desulfurization fortress. In this way, in less than a day, all twenty-four signs were taken away. Ma Shuyuan said that at first we thought that although the classes and groups had discussed it, these key points would still have to go through repeated experiments, and it would take at least a few days to figure them out. Who knew that the next day someone would come to report good news. And it can be said to be one after another. All the trade union cadres were dispatched but they still couldn't handle it all. As he spoke, he pointed to the merit-making stage next to him and said, "Count how many good news reports are posted there, and you will know how many key points have been solved." I looked at it, and there were quite a few, with twenty-two neatly pasted on it, writing: "No. 1 Blast Furnace: Small material batches and high material lines have been realized..." "No. 1 Blast Furnace: Reduce wind pressure and increase smelting intensity have been realized." "Small blast furnace: All-rounder, with great magical powers, making the material sieve end automation, reducing labor intensity..."
    I went to No. 1 Blast Furnace and ran into them tapping iron. The red-hot iron flowed into the long iron outlet ditch. Seen from a height, it looked like a red dragon. Furnace chief Wang Cai was intently watching the iron outlet. After everything was settled, he took me to the duty room. There was a copy of the People's Daily No. 7 on the table here, with many red lines drawn on a news item in the newspaper. "You're really reading the newspaper carefully," I said, and he immediately said, "How can I not be careful? This is a news item about Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant. Benxi is our opponent, and compared with them, we are still far behind."
    Wang Cai said excitedly, "In March this year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held a Red Flag Competition Conference in Beijing. Many iron and steel companies spoke on stage. That day, we sat next to the radio and listened to the broadcast, and we were so excited that we couldn't speak. Why could Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant's blast furnace utilization coefficient reach 2.212 in February? Is this all determined by conditions? When it comes to conditions, Taiyuan Iron and Steel's conditions are similar to Shijingshan Iron and Steel, and some are even worse than Shijingshan Iron and Steel, but how could their utilization coefficient reach 1.863 in February?"
    Everyone was determined to catch up. Then the factory held a Party Congress, a cadres' meeting, and a mass competition meeting. After the plans and measures were handed over to the masses for discussion in classes and groups, the masses had great confidence. They swore to the Party that they would increase the blast furnace utilization coefficient to 1.7 before May 1st. At this time, Comrade Xiao Ping, the secretary of the company's Party committee, came to No. 1 Blast Furnace to "enlist." He studied with the workers and technicians why the furnace was always not smooth? Is there coke in the furnace? Would it be better to grit our teeth and wash it three times in a row? After doing this, the furnace really got better, and the wind was strong. At this time, the people sent to Taiyuan Iron and Steel to learn also came back, bringing back many advanced experiences. Soon, the furnace chiefs of the Benxi and Taiyuan youth furnaces came to the factory to exchange experiences. In this way, production improved day by day.
    That day, on the way home, I walked and thought, recalling the hot scenes of the Red Flag Competition that were taking place in various factories these days. No matter which factory I went to, I would almost always encounter the scene of workers beating gongs and drums to report good news to the Party committee. No matter which workshop I went to, I would encounter advanced figures, advanced experiences, and advanced technologies. I thought of Li Rongzeng from the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, who, after learning Liao Shigang's advanced operating method, increased efficiency by 137 and a half times. I thought of Geng Shulan, a clever girl from the Civilian Electric Appliance Factory, who used to punch 800 gate plates a day, but now has increased it to 1,008. I also thought of the tense scenes of people chasing them. I thought of the bold words of the Gao Yulin lathe team from the No. 1 General Machinery Factory, who guaranteed to complete the annual plan five months ahead of schedule. Thinking, thinking, it seemed that I saw the scene of the various armies of industry and agriculture holding high the red flag, advancing forward with overwhelming force. Their heroic spirit can simply reverse the universe. Thinking, thinking, it seemed that a poem written by a worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant was unfolding in front of me: "The earth revolves for ten thousand years, without stopping for a moment. We hold high the red flag and compare with it, to see who revolves faster and more happily. If you ask us when we will stop? Even if the earth doesn't revolve, we will still revolve." Red flag - the embodiment of socialist competition, it is you who make the drums of battle sound louder and louder. It is you who make the tide of our socialist construction higher and higher.

　　红旗竞赛浪滔滔
　　本报记者　傅冬
    一个偶然的机会，我访问了北京市锦旗厂。
    走进这个厂的门市部，三间门面，到处都是红闪闪的锦旗。这些锦旗上写着：“奖给高产优质小组”、“赠给连续获得优质快速施工胜利的小组……”
    顾客中有一位干部说：“能不能想法再快一点？我们丰沙线幽州车站的工人等着夺这面红旗呢！临来时，大伙再三嘱咐，快点把旗拿回去，现在竞赛搞得热火朝天，一个赛一个，谁也不让谁，以前车皮到站要停四个半钟头，搞了红旗竞赛，只要三点四十八分钟。大伙说，4月份要把停车时间再减少到三个钟头……你想，要是空手回去，那怎么行？”
    这个刚说完，另一个紧接着插上来说：“我们电车公司要红旗也要得非常急，党中央和国务院号召掀起生产新高潮以后，公共汽车公司向我们挑战，我们要和他们比，公司内部也在比，小组和小组赛，个人和个人赛，大伙在比武会上说，不但要作到车子不闲不坏，还要在服务态度方面争取全国头一名。”
    人们正说着，柜台里走出一个业务员，他手里抱着一个包裹，边走边看表，说：“工人紧赶慢赶，到底把旗帜给赶出来了。现在离工厂开评比发奖大会还有一个钟头，赶着送去，还来得及……”说着就匆匆忙忙地坐车走了。
    我和业务员握手告别后，正要出门，迎面进来个人。怎么？是老李！老李是老熟人，他是石景山钢铁公司炼铁厂工会的干部。他一见我就热情地说：“公司里的竞赛比前几天搞得更热闹啦，大伙都找到了对手，炉和炉、班和班、组和组、人和人全赛起来了，马上就要评比发旗，所以不得不急急忙忙赶进城来买旗帜。”他又说：“打4月份起，公司的生产来了个大翻身，像一高炉每天都多出一百多吨生铁。高炉利用系数3月份还只有一点三八五，现在一下子就升到了一点六左右。”
    他的话，使我回想起几天前我去石钢采访的情景。那天，我刚到炼铁厂门口，见黑板报前围着一大群人，石钢小报的记者曹洪森同志也夹在人群里。他们一面看一面议论，有的还用本本记。这是干什么的？我走过去一看，上面贴着一副大红对联，上联是：“红旗竞赛浪滔滔”，下联是“真正英雄看今朝”，中间是一大堆数字。原来这些数字是本溪第一钢铁厂、太原钢铁公司、鞍钢和石钢的生产指标比较表。曹洪森同志给我介绍说，现在大伙对这个表最感兴趣，新的统计数字一出来，大家就争先恐后地跑来看，看看人家先进厂的高炉利用系数是多少，人家的冶炼强度、焦比比自家厂强多少？咱用什么法儿可以赶上去？曹洪森建议我去访问访问计划科。他说，那儿十天就要和太原钢铁公司、本溪第一钢铁厂通电话联系一次；现在我们这几家钢铁公司的关系是又紧张又密切，说紧张，是大家都在较量，说密切，大家又在不断地交流新的技术经验。像最近太钢就寄来一份资料，告诉我们怎样用水选矿的方法来提高矿粉含铁量。他们想的真周到，还附来一张图纸。我们哩，也把自己的双排风管和碳捣炉缸的资料寄给他们了。
    我们边说边走，不知不觉走到一个大布告牌前，那上面写着：“红旗竞赛台”，下面贴着许多红的、黄的大字报。上写：“如何利用现有两台八十四立方公尺风机与原来的一百零四立方公尺风机并联使用？如试成功，冶炼强度可提高20％以上。”“如何水选来宾锰矿”……旁边一些大字报则写满了这样的字句：“请英雄上台比武”，“请孔明参议”，“谁能出个计策？”我正仔细看大字报，工会主席马殳元走过来了。他说，这是提高生铁产量的二十四个关键。接着他又说，可惜上月31日你不在场，这场面才真叫热闹呢？那天早上，我们刚把这二十四个生产关键的牌子挂出去，没多久，就有人敲锣打鼓来拿牌子，说他们班经过讨论研究，大家认为自己可以想法解决提高冶炼强度的问题。不一阵，另一班又来了，说他们可以打保票，能攻下脱硫这个堡垒。这样不到一天的功夫，二十四个牌子全叫人给拿走了。马殳元说，开始我们曾想过，虽说班、组讨论过了，但这些关键还要经过反复的试验，起码得几天功夫才能搞出来。那知第二天就有人来报喜。而且可以说是一个接一个。工会干部全体出动都接应不过来。说着，他指着旁面的立功台说，你数数看，那里贴着多少喜报，就知道有多少关键已经解决了。我一看真不少，那上面整整齐齐贴着二十二张，上写：“一高炉：小料批、高料线已实现……。”“一高炉：降低风压，提高冶炼强度已实现。”“小高炉：多面手，神通广大，使上料筛末子自动化，减轻劳动强度……”。
    我去一高炉，碰上正在出铁水。通红的铁水流到长长的出铁沟里，从高处看去，简直像是一条红色的龙。炉长王才正聚精会神地看出铁口。等一切安顿停当，他带我到值班室。这里桌上放着一张7号的人民日报，在报上的一条新闻里，划着许多红道道。你看报看的可真仔细。我这么说了一句，他马上就说，不仔细怎么行？这是一条有关本溪第一钢铁厂的新闻，本溪是我们的对手，和人家一比，咱还差人家一大截。
    王才激动地说，今年3月冶金部在北京召开红旗竞赛大会，很多钢铁公司都上台说了话，那天我们坐在收音机旁听广播，心里激动得说不出话来，为什么本溪第一钢铁厂2月份高炉利用系数能到二点二一二，这难道全是条件决定的？要说条件，太钢的条件和石钢差不离，有的比石钢还次，但是人家2月份的利用系数怎么能达到一点八六三呢？
    大伙决心赶上去。接着全厂召开党代表大会、干部会和群众比武大会，计划和措施交给群众分班、分组讨论后，群众信心很高，他们向党宣誓，要在5月1日以前把高炉利用系数提高到一点七。这时公司党委书记萧平同志到一高炉“当兵”来了。他和工人、技术人员在一起研究炉子为什么老不顺？是不是炉里结焦了？好不好下个狠心连着洗它三次？这样一弄，炉子果然好起来了，风打得很足。这时派到太钢去学习的人也回来了，带来了好些先进经验。不久，本溪和太原青年炉的炉长来厂交流经验，就这样，生产一天比一天有起色。
    那天，我在回家的路上，一路走一路想，想起这些天各厂开展红旗竞赛热气腾腾的景象。无论走到那个厂子，几乎都会碰到工人敲锣打鼓向党委报喜的场面。无论走到那个车间，都会碰到先进的人物、先进的经验、先进的技术。我想起第一机床厂的李荣增，他学了廖世刚的先进操作法以后，使效率提高了一百三十七倍半。想起民用电器厂巧姑娘耿淑兰冲刀闸板，过去一天只能冲八百个，现在提高到一千零八个。还想起人们追赶他们的紧张情景。想起第一通用机械厂高玉林车工小组保证提前五个月完成全年计划的豪言壮语。想着，想着，在我的面前似乎出现了工农业各路大军高举红旗，排山倒海向前迈进的景象。他们那种英雄气概，简直可以扭转乾坤。想着想着，好像在我面前摊开了石景山发电厂一位工人写的诗：“地球万年转，一刻不停闲，我们高举红旗和它比，看谁转得快又欢，要问我们何时停？地球不转我们也要转。”红旗——社会主义竞赛的化身，是你，使得战斗的锣鼓一阵比一阵敲得响。是你，使得我们社会主义建设的浪潮一天比一天高。
