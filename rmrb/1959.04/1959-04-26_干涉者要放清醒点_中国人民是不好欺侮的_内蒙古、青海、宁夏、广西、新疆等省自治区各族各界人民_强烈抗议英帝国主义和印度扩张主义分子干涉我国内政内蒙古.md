Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 25th: People of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are extremely indignant at the Indian expansionists' open support for the Tibetan bandits' interference in our internal affairs, and even their insults to our leaders. They have put forward solemn accusations and protests.

Ha Feng'a (Mongolian), Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said: "The suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere. China and India are friendly neighbors, and the 'Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence' jointly advocated by China and India should not be undermined. Imperialists and Indian expansionists should wake up; the 600 million Chinese people who have stood up are not to be bullied." The Inner Mongolia Branch of the Buddhist Association of China issued a statement saying: "Tibet has been an integral part of Chinese territory since ancient times, and all affairs of Tibet are our country's internal affairs. The Inner Mongolia Buddhist community resolutely supports all measures taken by the State Council to quell the Tibetan rebellion, and resolutely condemns foreign interferers." The statement also expressed concern about the current situation of the Dalai Lama, hoping that he will break free from the abduction of the Tibetan bandits and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. He Zhaolin (Mongolian), Deputy Secretary-General of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: "Why are the Indian expansionists so rampant and vociferous, interfering in our internal affairs, after the armed rebellion launched by the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet was quelled? Does this comply with the Five Principles?"

Workers and peasants of all ethnic groups in Hohhot held discussion meetings today, unanimously condemning and protesting against the imperialists and Indian expansionists' acts of undermining our country's unity, interfering in our internal affairs, and insulting our leaders. Yin Runsuo, the captain of the First Production Team of the Xicaiyuan People's Commune in the suburbs, said: "The Indian expansionists' blatant slander of our country is truly infuriating. What is especially infuriating is that the Indian expansionists openly insulted our beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, which is a great insult to all the Chinese people, and we express our serious protest against this."

Teachers and students of nine ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, Daur, Ewenki, Tujia, and Yi, at Inner Mongolia University also held a discussion meeting today, unanimously angrily denouncing the imperialists and Indian expansionists' crude interference in China's internal affairs, and expressing serious protest against the Indian expansionists' open insult to the great leader of all ethnic groups in our country.

Qinghai

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 25th: The broad masses of Tibetan people in Qinghai Province warmly support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the speeches made by Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain and other representatives at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, and sternly refuted the lies in the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," expressing their firm opposition to foreign interference in our internal affairs.

Gu Jiasai (Tibetan), Deputy Secretary-General of the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee, said: "The absurd statement in the so-called 'Statement of the Dalai Lama' that does not regard Tibetans as Chinese is definitely not the Dalai Lama's original intention, because he himself is from Qinghai."

Chuanba Pengcuo (Tibetan), Acting Director of the Xining Office of the Tibetan Bainqen, said: "When I saw the so-called 'Statement of the Dalai Lama' distributed by Indian diplomatic officials, I felt extremely angry. I completely agree with what Bainqen Master said at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress: 'Our Tibet will always be Chinese Tibet, and we will never allow any foreigners to interfere in our Tibet and our China!' China is a unified multi-ethnic country, not only with Tibetans, but also with dozens of ethnic minorities such as Mongolians, Huis, and Uyghurs. The fallacy of attempting to split the unity of the motherland and engage in so-called 'Tibetan independence' by saying that 'Tibetans and Chinese Han people are different' is not worth refuting."

Geng Ga (Tibetan), a typesetter at the Qinghai Daily Printing Factory, said: "Everyone knows that China is a multi-ethnic country, and each ethnic group has its own characteristics. But all are members of the motherland's big family. If we follow this so-called 'Statement of the Dalai Lama,' Qinghai Province alone would have to be divided into several countries, wouldn't that be a big joke?"

At the discussion meeting held by teachers and students of all ethnic groups at Qinghai Nationalities Institute, everyone unanimously agreed in their speeches that the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" was imposed on the Dalai Lama by others. Tibetan student Suo'an Caidan said: "Judging from the many talks and articles published by the Dalai Lama in the past few years, especially the three letters he recently sent to General Tan Guansan, the publication of this 'statement' must be someone using the Dalai Lama's name to attempt to achieve the evil purpose of splitting our country." Tibetan female student San Zhou said: "We Tibetan people have never asked for any so-called 'Tibetan independence.' I want to tell the drafters of the statement: Tibetans only have China as their motherland." Tibetan students in the training class of the Qinghai Provincial College of Finance and Economics also expressed their firm support for Premier Zhou's government work report, and unanimously believed that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao had brought a good and happy life to the Tibetan people since liberation.

Tibetan herdsmen Jie Jia, Suo Duo, and Zhuoma from Tongde County in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, all expressed extreme anger at the rumors, slanders, and interference in our internal affairs by imperialist and Indian expansionist elements. Zhuoma said: "The so-called 'Tibetan independence' is definitely not the will of the Tibetan people, and we Tibetan people firmly oppose it. Those who clamor for 'Tibetan independence' are simply trying to oppose the Tibetan people's happy life, in order to achieve their ambition of ruling the Tibetan people and make our Tibetan people their slaves forever. These reactionary elements' ideas are completely wrong, and the eyes of our Tibetan people are sharp; we can see clearly who is good and who is bad. We will always follow the Communist Party and resolutely take the socialist road."

Ningxia

This newspaper reports that people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region unanimously angrily condemned the crimes of British imperialism and Indian expansionists in interfering in our internal affairs.

Members of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Yinchuan City gathered on the afternoon of the 24th to discuss Premier Zhou's report at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. More than a dozen members spoke at the meeting, unanimously believing that the unity of the motherland and the unity of the nationalities are the highest interests of all ethnic groups, and must not be undermined. The Indian expansionists' conspiracy of engaging in so-called "Tibetan independence" is interference in our internal affairs, and will surely suffer a miserable defeat. Hui member and CPPCC Vice Chairman He Yijiang said that the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government are meticulous in their concern for the Hui people, the Tibetan people, and other ethnic minorities. However, the original Tibetan local government and upper-level reactionary elements insisted on a reactionary stance and, under the planning of imperialists and foreign reactionaries, betrayed the motherland and undermined the unity of the motherland, which is not allowed by our Hui people. At the same time, the imperialists and Indian expansionists' attempt to fish in troubled waters is even more wishful thinking. Quelling the Tibetan rebellion is our internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere. Shi Jiecheng, a member of the Board of Directors of the Buddhist Association, pointed out in his speech that imperialists and foreign reactionary elements want to use the Tibetan rebellion to split the unity of our country's nationalities and make the Tibetan people live in darkness again. This conspiracy is very vicious, and we Buddhists will never allow it. Huang Guangyun, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, said that the Indian expansionist elements have forgotten the pain of being oppressed by British imperialism in the past, but now they are following the imperialists in singing the platitude of "Tibetan independence," which we firmly oppose. Wang Fucheng, Imam of the Xiguan Mosque in Yinchuan City, Ma Zhongyi, Imam of the Zhongda Mosque, Ma Wenliang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Yinchuan Municipal CPPCC, and others unanimously angrily condemned the Indian expansionist elements' vain attempt to realize their expansionist ambitions by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion. They solemnly warned the Indian expansionist elements: Any ambition to fish in troubled waters on the Tibetan issue will never be realized, and will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. Guangxi

This newspaper reports that on the afternoon of the 25th, forty cadres from six ethnic minorities – Zhuang, Han, Miao, Yao, Dong, and Hui – from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Nationalities Affairs Commission held a forum to angrily condemn the British imperialists and Indian expansionists who planned the Tibetan armed rebellion. They said that no foreign ambitious people are allowed to interfere in our country's internal affairs. Zhuang cadre Mo Junqing listed at the meeting the facts that the Zhuang people have achieved vigorous development in all aspects since liberation, explaining that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can ethnic minorities truly get rid of poverty and backwardness, and can they achieve prosperity and development in politics, economy, and culture. He said that we must thoroughly shatter the conspiracy to undermine our country's unity. Han cadre Xu Yaoren said that our great motherland was jointly created by the working people of all ethnic groups with their labor, wisdom, and blood. The unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities are the highest interests of all ethnic groups. Any conspiracy by imperialists and foreign reactionaries to undermine the unity of the motherland is bound to suffer a shameful defeat. Miao cadre Liang Qingguang said that the Tibetan issue is our country's internal affair, and no foreigners are allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs. The cadres of all ethnic groups present at the meeting were very angry at the imperialists and Indian expansionists' support for the Tibetan armed rebellion and interference in China's internal affairs. Everyone firmly stated that they would cherish the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities as they cherish their own eyes, and resolutely fight to the end against all acts that undermine the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities.

Xinjiang

This newspaper reports that people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region angrily condemn the Indian expansionists' conspiracy to realize their expansionist ambitions by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion, and express that they will use actions to further strengthen the unity of all nationalities and consolidate the unity of the motherland to oppose the unreasonable interference of imperialists and foreign reactionaries. Abudulayouf, Secretary-General of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a Uyghur, said that the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," a statement full of loopholes and lies, was imposed on the Dalai Lama by others. We express strong indignation after reading it. Today, the Tibetan people, like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, have sharp eyes. They know who is the enemy and who is the friend. All reactionary elements and Indian expansionists cannot stop our path forward.

Patiman, Vice-Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Women's Federation, a Kazakh, said that the people of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang all know that Tibet is our Chinese territory, and anyone who wants to interfere in our internal affairs is wasting their efforts. She said that since the liberation of Xinjiang, the religious beliefs of all ethnic groups have always been free, and Tibet is the same. However, imperialists and foreign reactionary elements, as well as the Tibetan rebel group, slander China for undermining religion. In fact, they hide ulterior motives behind their backs and want to use this cliche to undermine the unity of all ethnic groups in our country and split the unity of our motherland. We resolutely condemn the crimes of the Indian expansionists and the Tibetan rebel group.

Usman Ziya, Deputy Director of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Education Department, said that the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities are the fundamental guarantee for us to build socialism. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the unity of all ethnic groups in our motherland has been strengthened more than ever before, and the material and cultural levels have been improved. Imperialists and Indian expansionists are taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble and undermine our country's unity and ethnic unity, and will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

    强烈抗议英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政内蒙古
    新华社呼和浩特25日电　内蒙古自治区各族人民对印度扩张主义分子公开支持西藏叛匪干涉我国内政，甚至侮辱我国领袖的行为极为愤慨，纷纷提出严正指责和抗议。
    内蒙古自治区副主席哈丰阿（蒙古族）说：平息西藏叛乱是中国内政，不准任何人干涉。中印两国是友好邻邦，中印两国共同倡导的“和平共处五项原则”，不应该受到破坏。帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子应该清醒一点，站起来了的六亿中国人民是不好欺侮的。中国佛教协会内蒙古自治区分会发表声明说：西藏自古以来就是中国领土的一部分，西藏的一切事务都是我国的内政。内蒙古佛教界坚决拥护国务院平息西藏叛乱所采取的一切措施，并坚决谴责外国干涉者。声明还对达赖喇嘛的目前处境表示关切，希望他早日摆脱西藏叛匪的劫持，重回祖国的怀抱。中国人民政治协商会议内蒙古自治区委员会副秘书长何兆麟（蒙古族）说：为什么在西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱被平息之后，印度扩张主义分子狂妄地大肆叫嚣，干涉我国内政，这难道是符合五项原则的吗？
    呼和浩特市各族职工和农民今天纷纷举行座谈会，一致愤怒谴责和抗议帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子破坏我国统一，干涉我国内政和侮辱我国领袖的行为。郊区西菜园人民公社第一生产大队队长殷润锁说：印度扩张主义分子公然放肆地诬蔑我国，这真使人气愤。尤其令人愤慨的是印度扩张主义分子竟公然侮辱我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，这是对全中国人民的极大侮辱，我们对此表示严重抗议。
    内蒙古大学的蒙古、回、满、达斡尔、鄂温克、土家、彝等九个民族的师生今天也举行了座谈会，一致愤怒斥责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子对中国内政的粗暴干涉，并对印度扩张主义分子公然侮辱我国各族人民伟大领袖表示严重抗议。
    青海
    新华社西宁25日电　青海省广大藏族人民热烈拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞等代表在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的发言，并严词驳斥了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中的谎言，表示坚决反对外国干涉我国内政。
    青海省人民委员会副秘书长古嘉赛（藏族）说：所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中荒谬的不把西藏人当作中国人，这决不是达赖喇嘛的本意，因为他本人就是青海人。
    西藏班禅驻西宁办事处代理处长川巴彭措（藏族）说：当我看到由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”以后，感到无比愤怒。我完全同意班禅大师在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所说：“我们西藏永远是中国的西藏，我们永远不许任何外国人干涉我们西藏和我们中国的事情！”中国是一个统一的多民族国家，不仅有藏族，还有蒙古、回、维吾尔等几十个少数民族，企图用所谓“西藏人和中国的汉人不同”的说法来分裂祖国的统一和搞什么“西藏独立”，这种谬论是不值得一驳的。
    青海日报印刷厂排字工人更尕（藏族）说：谁都知道，中国是个多民族的国家，各民族都有自己的特点。但都是祖国大家庭中的一员。如果按照这个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”来讲，仅我们青海省就要分成几个国家，这岂不成了天大的笑话。
    在青海民族学院的各族师生举行的座谈会上，大家在发言中也一致认为所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”是别人强加在达赖喇嘛身上的。藏族学员索安才旦说：从达赖喇嘛过去几年来发表的许多谈话和文章，特别是最近给谭冠三将军的三封信来看，发表这个“声明”，一定是有人假借达赖喇嘛名义企图达到分裂我国的罪恶目的。藏族女学员叁周说：我们西藏人民从来没有要求过什么所谓“西藏独立”。我要告诉声明的起草者：西藏人只有中国是自己的祖国。青海省财经学院轮训班的藏族学员们也都表示坚决拥护周总理的政府工作报告，并一致认为解放几年来共产党和毛主席给藏族人民带来了美好的幸福生活。
    海南藏族自治州同德县的藏族牧民姐加、索多和卓玛等人，都对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的造谣诬蔑和干涉我国内政的行为表示万分愤怒。卓玛说：所谓“西藏独立”，这决不是西藏人民的意愿，我们藏族人民坚决反对。那些叫嚷“西藏独立”的分子，无非是为了反对藏族人民过幸福生活，以达到统治西藏人民的野心，叫我们藏族人民永远作他们的奴隶。这些反动分子的主意完全打错了，我们藏族人民的眼睛是雪亮的，谁好谁坏，我们看得清清楚楚。我们要永远跟着共产党走，坚决走社会主义道路。
    宁夏
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区各族各界人民一致愤怒声讨英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的罪行。

    新疆维吾尔自治区妇女联合会副主任、哈萨克族的帕提曼说，我们新疆少数民族人民都知道，西藏是我们中国的领土，一切想干涉我国内政的人，都是枉费心机。她说，新疆解放以来，各族人民的宗教信仰一直是自由的，西藏也是一样。可是，帝国主义和外国反动派以及西藏叛乱集团诬蔑中国破坏宗教，其实他们背后隐藏着不可告人的阴谋，是想用这个陈词滥调来破坏我国各民族的团结，分裂我们祖国的统一。我们坚决谴责印度扩张主义分子和西藏叛乱集团的罪行。
    新疆维吾尔自治区教育厅副厅长乌斯满孜牙说，祖国的统一和民族的团结是我们建设社会主义的根本保证，在党和毛主席的领导下，我们祖国各民族的团结比任何时候都加强了，物质和文化水平都提高了，帝国主义和印度扩张主义者借西藏叛乱事件兴风作浪破坏我国的统一和民族团结，必将遭到可耻的失败。（附图片）
