A Red Banner
The Experience of Shangcai People in Fighting Against Poor Mountains and Bad Waters

　　The Eighth Squad of the First Brigade of the Wujiang People's Commune in Zhangpu County, Fujian Province (formerly Shangcai Gaoqiang Cooperative) is located at the confluence of the Wujiang River and the inland sea, bordered by the sea to the south and surrounded by five rugged mountains to the northeast, belonging to the coastal hilly area. Over the years, many hills have become gravel and thin sheet erosion areas. Every time there was a rainfall of more than 30 millimeters, the embankments would be breached, and more than 30% of the farmland would be impacted by erosion. As a result, crop yields were very low, and the people's lives were impoverished.

　　In April 1957, the people of Shangcai put forward the slogan of "Fighting hard for a year and a half to change the natural appearance of Shangcai" and began a tenacious struggle against poor mountains and bad waters. By October 1958, great achievements had been made. On more than 7,500 mu of mountain land in the entire squad, 2,800 mu of forest had been planted, more than 28,000 fish-scale pits and 14,000 meters of contour terraces had been dug, 880 mu of land had been leveled, 856 large and small check dams had been built, and 65 mu of field ridges had been repaired, achieving "step-by-step control, section-by-section water interception, soil not leaving the mountain, water not leaving the ditch," basically controlling all soil erosion, changing the natural appearance of Shangcai, and reducing waterlogging, drought, and flash flood disasters. In July 1958, during a rainfall of 382 millimeters, the embankments did not breach. The total output of early-season rice sown in 1958 was more than 480,000 jin, an increase of more than 38,000 jin compared with the same season in 1957 before the control measures.

　　The reason why this squad's soil and water conservation work has achieved great success, becoming a red banner for soil and water conservation work in Zhangpu County and winning the State Council's Soil and Water Conservation Committee's pennant award twice in a row, is due to the following experiences:

　　First, the Party branch places soil and water conservation work in an important position in agricultural capital construction. After learning the lesson of the erosion of more than 20 mu of farmland and the loss of more than 3,000 jin of grain during a rainfall of 32.5 millimeters in March 1957, the Party branch deeply realized that the most fundamental problem in improving the production and living standards of the commune members was to quickly control soil erosion. Therefore, the Party branch placed soil and water conservation work in an important position in agricultural capital construction. Cai Yaozong, the secretary of the Party branch, personally served as the director of the Soil and Water Conservation Committee, and Cai Yuanhuo, a member of the Party branch committee, was in charge of soil and water conservation work on a full-time basis. After the soil and water conservation movement was fully launched, Party members and cadres were selected to take charge of areas with serious soil erosion to strengthen leadership.

　　Second, strengthen ideological work among commune members. In the early stage of soil and water conservation work, some commune members were worried that the area of soil erosion was large and difficult to control, and some were afraid that it would take too much labor and affect their income. Under the unified leadership of the Party branch, the Soil and Water Conservation Committee adopted methods such as presenting facts, calculating detailed accounts, and organizing visits. A grievance meeting attended by more than 200 people was held in Ou Kuang Village, where soil erosion was serious, to educate the masses with the fact that the once famous ferry crossing of Congjun Village (with more than 500 households) had become ruins. At the same time, the commune members were given an account of soil and water loss and an account of increased income from soil and water conservation. Then, a gully was selected in Shanzai Village for typical demonstration, and commune members and cadres were organized to visit the site, so that commune members and cadres realized that controlling soil erosion was not a labor-intensive task. In terms of engineering measures, it only takes two or three workdays to initially control one mu of area. After taking this series of measures, the commune members' confidence and determination to transform nature was strengthened, and the commune members automatically carried mountain hoes and braved the rain to go up the mountain to repair small dams.

　　Third, rationally allocate labor and organize the entire people to carry out soil and water conservation work. In the case of a small labor force and serious soil erosion, it is inevitable that there will be conflicts between labor and agricultural production if comprehensive control is carried out in one go. However, they adopted the method of large-scale operations during the slack season after rain, combined with the perennial work of professional teams, which solved the labor difficulties in carrying out soil and water conservation work. The specific method is: in busy months, the soil and water conservation professional team (42 people) stationed in Shanzai Village will repair and reinforce the project, strengthen the management of fruit trees, and close the mountains for afforestation. Outside of busy months, generally 50% of the labor force is transferred and more than 400 auxiliary laborers are mobilized to invest in soil and water conservation blitz. After the realization of the people's commune in September 1958, more than 3,300 commune members were mobilized to launch a general attack on Shanzai and other mountains. Thanks to the participation of the entire people, more than 37,400 cubic meters of earthwork were completed in two days and nights, making fish-scale pits, contour terraces, and check dams scattered all over the hillsides and gullies of Shanzai and other mountains.

　　Fourth, carry out comprehensive control in accordance with the characteristics of erosion and adapt to local conditions. In terms of control methods, they carried out overall planning according to the topographic characteristics of "exposed rocks, criss-crossing gullies, and gravel all over the slopes," and determined the control policy of digging fish-scale pits for afforestation and building check dams, combining biological measures with engineering measures. On the slopes, fish-scale pits (or contour terraces) were dug to vigorously plant trees and grass; on the rocky mountains, mountains were opened and land was leveled to use guest soil for afforestation; and in deep gullies, a large number of check dams were built to prevent the continued development of gullies. At the same time, the long-disrepaired field ridges were raised and thickened to maintain soil and water.

　　上蔡人民和穷山恶水斗争的经验
    福建漳浦县浯江人民公社第一大队第八中队（原上蔡高强社），位于浯江大溪注入内海的汇口处，南部滨海，东北部五座崎山环抱，属沿海丘陵地区。多年以来许多山丘变成了砾石和贫薄的片状冲刷地区，每降三十公厘以上的雨，堤岸就被冲决口，30％多的农田受到冲压。因此，农作物产量很低，人民生活贫困。
    1957年4月间，上蔡人民提出了“艰苦奋战一年半载，改变上蔡自然面貌”的口号，开始和穷山恶水进行顽强的斗争。到1958年10月，已获得巨大的成就，在全中队七千五百多亩山地上，造林二千八百亩，挖鱼鳞坑二万八千多个、水平沟一万四千公尺，整地八百八十亩，修建大小谷坊八百五十六座和培修地埂六十五亩，做到“步步控制，节节拦水，土不下山，水不出沟”，基本控制全部水土流失，改变了上蔡的自然面貌，减免了水旱和山洪灾害。1958年7月间一次降雨三百八十二公厘，堤岸没有发生决口。1958年早季播种的水稻总产四十八万多斤，比治理前的1957年同季，增产粮食三万八千多斤。
    这个中队水土保持工作所以能够取得了巨大的成绩，成为漳浦县水土保持工作的一面红旗，连续两次荣获国务院水土保持委员会的锦旗奖励，有以下几点经验：
    第一、党支部把水土保持工作放在农业基本建设的重要地位上。这个中队党支部在吸取了1957年3月间一次降雨三十二点五公厘就冲压农田二十多亩，损失粮食三千多斤的教训，深刻地体会到要提高社员的生产、生活水平，最根本的问题就是迅速控制水土流失。因此，党支部就把水土保持工作放在农业基本建设的重要地位上。党支部书记蔡耀宗亲自兼任水土保持委员会主任，并由党支委蔡元火专职负责水土保持工作。在水土保持运动全面铺开之后，水土冲刷严重的地区都选派党员干部包干负责，以加强领导。
    第二、加强对社员的思想工作。在水土保持工作开展初期，有的社员顾虑水土流失面积大，难于治理，有的怕花工多，影响收入。在党支部的统一领导下，水土保持委员会就采取摆事实、算细账和组织参观等办法，在水土流失严重的欧圹村召开了有二百多人参加的诉苦大会，以过去著名渡口从军庄（有五百多户）变成废墟的事实，来教育群众。与此同时，还向社员算了水土损失账和保持水土增收账。接着，在山仔村选择一条沟进行典型示范，组织社员、干部实地参观，使社员、干部认识到控制水土流失并不是一项花工多的工作，在治理工程措施上，初步控制一亩面积只需二、三个工（日）就够了。通过采取这一系列措施之后，坚定了社员们改造自然的信心与决心，社员自动荷着山锄冒雨上山修仔坊。
    第三、合理地调配劳力，组织全民开展水土保持工作。在劳力少、水土冲刷严重的情况下，要一鼓作气地全面进行治理，难免会在劳力上和农业生产发生矛盾。可是他们在农闲雨后采取了大兵团作战的方法，结合专业队常年开展工作，解决了开展水土保持工作的劳力困难。具体作法是：在忙月里，就由安营扎寨在山仔村的水土保持专业队（四十二人）整修加固工程，加强果树管理和封山育林。在忙月以外，一般抽调50％的劳力和动员四百多个附带劳力，投入水土保持突击运动。1958年9月间实现了人民公社化以后，更调动了三千三百多个社员，大规模地向山仔等山头发起总攻。由于全民参战，两昼夜就完成土方三万七千四百多公方，使山仔等山坡地上和沟槽地上，鱼鳞坑、水平沟和谷坊星罗棋布。
    第四、根据冲刷特点，因地制宜地进行综合治理。在治理方法上，他们根据“岩石裸露，沟壑纵横，满坡砂砾”的地形特点，进行了全面规划，因地制宜地确定了挖鱼鳞坑造林和修建谷坊、生物措施与工程措施相结合的治理方针，在坡地上挖鱼鳞坑（或水平沟）大力造林植草；在石头山上开山整地利用客土造林，在深沟大壑里大量修建谷坊，以防止沟壑继续发展。同时还把年久失修的田埂加高培厚，以保持水土。
