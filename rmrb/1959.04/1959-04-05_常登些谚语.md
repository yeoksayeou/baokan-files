    Often Publish Proverbs
    The People's Daily supplement published many proverbs in 1956 and 1957, including Chinese and foreign ones, agricultural proverbs, and other aphorisms. These short, striking sentences contained very rich content, demonstrated the intelligence and wisdom of the people, and possessed a high degree of artistic quality. Therefore, they were very popular. I once cut out all these proverbs completely and pasted them into a book, often flipping through them with my companions during breaks from labor, and I loved them. However, the newspaper has not published proverbs for a long time. I feel regret and disappointment about this. I hope the editors can select some proverbs for publication as they did in the past.

    常登些谚语
    人民日报副刊在1956年和1957年曾刊载了不少谚语，有中国的，有外国的，有农谚，有其他方面的格言。短小的惊句，包含了十分丰富的内容，表现了人民群众的聪明和智慧，语言具有高度的艺术性。因此，很受人欢迎。我曾把这些谚语完整无遗地剪裁下来，粘贴成册，在劳动之余经常和同伴们翻看，爱不释手。但是，很久以来报纸上没有发表谚语了。对此，感到遗憾、失望。希望编辑同志能像过去那样，常选些谚语刊登。
