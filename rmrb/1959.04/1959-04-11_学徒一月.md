　　Apprentice for a Month
　　Gao Xiaosheng, Deputy Manager of the Earthwork Company of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation

    This time, my down-to-earth labor was mainly as an apprentice on a tractor in Team One. When working the early shift, I would get up every morning to refuel and water the tractor, and scrape off the dirt, doing the work of an apprentice. My master, Ke Meiru, seeing that I worked diligently, carefully explained technical knowledge to me and taught me how to operate the machinery. As a result of working, eating, living, studying, and entertaining with the workers for fifty days, I gradually became close friends with them. At the same time, through this down-to-earth labor, I further understood the thoughts and demands of the masses and learned about some of the key problems and solutions in production. This is of great benefit to improving leadership work and better organizing production. I will only discuss three production issues here:

    One night, we were chatting in the worker's shed when driver Shen Li asked me, "How can we tractor drivers become multi-skilled?" I asked him what he thought. He said, "We should not only be able to drive tractors but also learn to operate excavators, trucks, and cranes." Someone immediately chimed in, "We can learn electric welding, oxygen welding, and fitter's work, and then learn to operate lathes." But Comrade Ke Meiru disagreed. He said, "We should first learn to repair tractors." Everyone argued heatedly.

    Most of the tractor drivers are young people in their twenties and thirties. Obviously, they all care about their future development prospects. However, I had been sitting in the office in the past and had not thought about how they could further improve their skills. This evening's conversation gave me great inspiration, and from then on, I paid attention to soliciting everyone's opinions in casual conversations. One day, Huang Taifu, who shared a room with me, took off his clothes and went to bed, but he still excitedly said to me, "I've wanted to learn repairs for a long time. I raised the idea last year, but the leadership didn't approve it!" "Why do you want to learn repairs?" "Hey! We pull the operating lever every day. How can our skills improve? Besides, now if the vehicle has a minor problem, we rely on others to fix it. It would be great if we could repair it ourselves!" I said, "It would be even better if you knew how to do major, medium, and minor repairs." Huang Taifu immediately sat up and asked, "Can this be achieved?" I said, "If everyone agrees, it can be achieved." I also consulted and networked among the masses and learned that the vast majority of drivers advocated learning repairs, and they also put forward specific methods. I went to the team to solicit the opinions of the branch secretary and the team leader, and they also believed that this was a direction for development. Comrade Ruan Hai, the branch secretary, made a report at the general meeting and organized everyone to discuss it. Now, the team has already set out a plan to achieve driver self-repair of tractors within two years.

    The most worrying thing is that the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's large-scale plant and the primary rolling mill are scheduled to go into production this year, but the rolling mill site has not yet been leveled. How can we speed up the leveling of earthwork? Before I came down, I couldn't think of a good solution and was very distressed. The worker comrades, in their discussions of the plan, proposed the method of working three shifts day and night.

    We don't have many earthmoving machines to begin with, but we only work two shifts, leaving eight hours idle every day. To solve the problem of working three shifts, I had solicited opinions in the office last year and also consulted relevant technical books. At that time, there were two opinions: one said that machines, like people, need to rest every day, otherwise, they would be greatly damaged, so they opposed working three shifts; the other said that no book stipulates that maintenance is only required every eight hours, and there is no prohibition against continuous operation, so they advocated working three shifts. The two sides held opposing views. We had also once allowed the motorcade to work three shifts on the railway overpass project, but as a result, many cars broke down. At that time, we didn't investigate the cause of the breakdowns in depth, and we concluded that it was caused by working three shifts and restored the two-shift system.

    Can all kinds of earthmoving machinery, tractors, excavators, trucks, etc., work three shifts? After that, we never considered it again. But the workers brought it up in their discussions of the plan: work three shifts! This made me think that I should continue to study the advantages and disadvantages of working three shifts. On the way to work, I asked driver Wang Zhiyuan, "Can we work three shifts regularly?" He said, "As long as we maintain it carefully, it's completely possible." But some people disagreed, saying, "We used to work three shifts, and the machines were severely damaged." I asked many people for their opinions, and the majority believed that the machines were damaged in the past because everyone's awareness was not high at that time. In order to compete for piecework wages, they didn't carefully maintain the vehicles. Now that everyone's awareness has improved, everyone will cherish the vehicles and can work three shifts. Some people considered that the temperature of the machines would increase with continuous operation, which would not be possible in the hot summer. But if we deduct the three months of summer, there are still nine months when we can implement three shifts! I also went to consult the machine repair group responsible for repairs and maintenance. They not only agreed to work three shifts but also said that if we work two shifts in cold weather, we are afraid that the water tank will freeze when we get off work at night, so we have to drain the water. It is difficult to start every morning when we add water, and sometimes we use other vehicles to tow it, which causes great mechanical wear. If we work three shifts, we can keep the vehicle temperature normal, which is actually beneficial.

    After the team studied the opinions of the masses, it was decided to work three shifts. In this way, an average of more than 1,600 cubic meters of earth is shoveled and transported every day, and more than 25,000 cubic meters of the plan have been completed in the past half month. The entire team has a total of twenty-nine shoveling machines, and the plan is to have twenty-three machines in attendance every day, but in reality, more than twenty-five machines have been maintained every day. Now, the team has transferred eight machines to other construction sites, but we are still confident of completing the earthwork leveling project on the rolling mill site one month ahead of schedule.

    When discussing the completion of the first quarter plan, many groups raised the issue of using the fourth gear for heavy vehicles (now vehicles loaded with soil are only allowed to use the third gear; the fourth gear is more than two kilometers faster per hour than the third gear).

    This is an old problem. Before 1956, there were no restrictions on the use of gears; some people, in order to compete for extra bonuses, did not consider the site conditions, opened the throttle wide, put it in fourth gear, and drove fast, resulting in severe damage to the vehicles. When the company's leadership saw this situation, they stipulated that heavy vehicles were not allowed to use fourth gear, otherwise, it would be a violation of operating procedures. Since then, the tractors have been like having iron chains on their legs, unable to run fast.

    This time, the workers raised the issue of using the fourth gear again. If I were still in the office, I would never agree, and I might even criticize them for "not considering the life of the machines." But this time, hearing that the workers in the group generally had this opinion, it aroused my attention. The workers put forward convincing reasons: now the construction site is wide, the road is smooth, and the transportation distance is long, especially since everyone's awareness has greatly improved, and everyone will reasonably use the gears according to the actual site conditions. In the past, the machine repair group responsible for repairing the vehicles was the most opposed to using the fourth gear, so I went to find more than a dozen old repair workers to hold a meeting to study the issue. Unexpectedly, they all agreed and put forward operating precautions for using the fourth gear.

    The more the problem is discussed, the deeper and more reasonable it becomes. Later, I studied the issue with the team headquarters, and the team leaders decided to test it with six tractors first, including our vehicle. In the past half month, the results of the experiment between my master and I showed that each shift can haul more than 30 cubic meters of soil, the machine sound is normal, and the vehicle has not been damaged. In this way, the problem is even more certain, and now the team leaders are drafting operating precautions for using the fourth gear in preparation for implementation.

    The above are several key production issues that I discovered and studied with the workers and team leaders under the leadership of the Party branch during my fifty days of down-to-earth labor. This made me deeply realize that only by going deep into the masses and participating in production can leaders truly lead production well and organize a great leap forward in production.

　　学徒一月
　　武钢土方公司施工副经理　高晓声
    我这次下放劳动，主要是在一队的拖拉机上当徒工。做早班的时候，每天早上起来，给拖拉机加油、加水、刮土，做好徒工的活儿。我的师傅柯美如见我劳动认真，就细心地向我讲解技术知识，教我学操纵。五十天和工人同劳动、同吃、同住、同学习、同娱乐的结果，我和工人逐渐成为亲密的朋友。同时，通过这次下放劳动，进一步了解了群众的思想、要求，了解了生产中的一些关键问题和解决办法。这对改进领导工作，更好地组织生产有很大的好处。这里只谈三个生产上的问题：
    一天夜里，我们在工棚里谈天，驾驶员沈立同志问我：“我们拖拉机驾驶员怎样才能成多面手？”我问他的看法怎样。他说：“不仅要会开拖拉机，还要学会开挖土机，开汽车、吊车。”旁边马上有人插话：“可以学电焊、氧焊，学钳工活，再学会掌握车床。”但柯美如同志不同意，他说：“应该首先学会修理拖拉机。”大家争论得很热烈。
    拖拉机驾驶员大多是二、三十岁的青年。很显然，他们都关心自己今后的发展前途。但是，我过去坐在机关里，却没有想过他们如何在业务上进一步提高的问题。这个夜晚的谈话给了我很大启发，从此我就注意在闲谈中征求大家的意见。有一天，和我同屋的黄太富脱衣上床了，但他还激动地对我讲：“我早就想学修理，去年就提过意见，领导上不批准！”“为什么要学修理呢？”“咳！我们天天拉操纵杆，技术怎能提高？再说，现在车子出点毛病，就依赖别人修。要能自己修理，多好！”我说：“如果大、中、小修都会，那就更好。”黄太富马上坐起来问道：“这能不能实现？”我说：“如果大家都同意了，就能实现。”我又在群众中酝酿、串连，了解到绝大多数驾驶员都主张学修理，他们还提出了具体办法。我便去队里征求支部书记和队长的意见，他们也认为这是发展方向。支部书记阮海同志就在大会上作了个报告，组织大家讨论。现在，队里已经订出了两年内做到驾驶包修拖拉机的规划。
    最令人着急的是：武钢大型厂、初轧厂都要在今年投入生产，可是轧钢工地还没有平整出来。怎样加快平整土方的速度呢？我在下来之前，没想出好办法，很苦闷。工人同志们在讨论计划中，却提出了日夜开三班的办法。
    我们的土方机械本来就不多，但还只开两班，每天闲八小时。为了解决开三班的问题，我去年在机关里曾征求过意见，也翻阅过有关的技术书。当时有两种意见：一是说机器跟人一样，需要每天休息，否则损害大，反对开三班；一是说任何书上只规定要八小时保养一次，没讲不能连续运转，主张开三班。双方意见争持不下。我们还曾经在铁路跨线桥工程中让汽车队开三班，结果汽车坏得很多。当时我们也没有深查坏的原因是什么，就认定是开三班引起的，又全部恢复两班制。
    究竟各种土方机械拖拉机、挖土机、汽车等，能不能开三班呢？从那以后，就没有再考虑。但工人们却在讨论计划中提出来了：开三班！这就使我想到应该继续研究开三班的利弊在哪里。在去上班的路上，我征求驾驶王志渊同志的意见：“能不能以经常开三班？”他说：“只要认真保养好，完全可以。”但也有人不同意，说：“过去开过三班，机器损坏得厉害。”我又向很多人征求意见，结果多数都认为过去机器损坏，是因为大家当时觉悟不高，为了争计件工资，不认真保养车子。现在觉悟都提高了，谁都会爱惜的车子，可以开三班。有人考虑到机器连续运行，温度增高，暑天不行。但扣去暑天三个月，还有九个月能实行三班！我又去征求负责修配的机务组的意见，他们不但同意开三班，而且说冷天开两班，夜间下班时恐怕水箱冻坏，要把水放掉，早晨又加水，每天早晨很难发动，有时就用别的车子拖，机械磨损大。如果开三班，可以使车子温度保持正常，反而有好处。
    队里把群众的意见研究后，决定开三班。这样，平均每天多铲运一千六百多方土，半个月来便多完成二万五千多方的计划。全队共有二十九台铲运机，计划每天出勤二十三台，而实际保持了每天二十五台以上。现在，队里又调出八台到别的工地，但我们还有把握提前一个月完成轧钢工地的土方平整工程。
    在讨论完成第一季度计划时，很多小组里都提出了重车使用四排档的问题（现在装满土的车，只准使用三排档；四排档比三排档每小时快两公里多）。
    这是个老问题了。1956年以前，使用排档没有限制；有些人为了争拿超额奖金，不根据现场条件，开大油门，放四排档、开快车，结果车子坏得厉害。公司领导上看见这种情况，便规定了重车不准使用四排档，否则便是违犯操作规程。从那以后，拖拉机便像腿上带着铁链一样，跑不快了。
    这次工人又提出使用四排档的问题。我如果还是在机关里，是绝不会同意的，甚至还会批评“不顾机器寿命”。但这次在小组里听到工人普遍都有这种意见，便引起了我的重视。工人们提出了令人信服的理由：现在施工场地宽、道路平、运距远，尤其是大家觉悟大大提高了，大家会按照现场实际情况，合理使用排档。过去，负责修车的机务组最反对使用四排档，我又去找十几个老修理工开会研究，出乎意料，他们也都同意，并提出了使用四排档的操作注意事项。
    问题越讨论，就越深刻、越合理。我后来和队部研究，队领导决定六部拖拉机先试验一下，其中便有我们那部车子。半个月来，我和师傅试验的结果，每班车可以多拉三十多方土，机器声音正常，车子也没有损坏。这样，问题更加肯定了，现在队领导正在拟定使用四排档操作注意事项，准备推行。
    以上是我在下放五十天的劳动中，在党支部领导下，和工人们、队领导一起发现、研究的几个生产关键问题。这使我深刻体会到：领导者只有深入群众参加生产，才真正能领导好生产，才能组织生产大跃进。（附图片）
