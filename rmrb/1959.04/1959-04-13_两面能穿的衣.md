    Reversible Clothing
    The Beijing Municipal Clothing Research Committee recently designed a new style of reversible men's top. This top is mostly made of relatively thick materials such as denim or double-sided khaki, with a simple and sturdy style, and can be worn on either side by reversing it; saving fabric and money.

    两面能穿的衣
    北京市服装研究委员会最近设计了一种新式样两面穿男上衣。这种上衣多是用劳动布或双面卡其等较厚的布料制成的，式样大方，又坚固，而且可以两面掉换着穿；省布又省钱。
