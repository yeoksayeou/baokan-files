Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Bonn news: Adenauer's current "vacation" at a sanatorium on Lake Como in Italy is by no means an ordinary vacation. According to the "Sunday World" newspaper, a teletype machine has been installed in Adenauer's residence at the sanatorium, maintaining constant contact with Bonn day and night. The newspaper also reported that "batches of political experts" are preparing to travel from Bonn to Italy to "visit" Adenauer to discuss the issue of who will succeed him as West German Chancellor.

According to "Sunday World," Robert Pferdmenges, a well-known West German banker, will be among the first to "call on" Adenauer. This banker has a very close relationship with Adenauer. The newspaper believes that this "banker will have a very important say in the selection of a (Chancellor) successor." It is said that the chairman of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group in the Federal Parliament and the chairman of the Christian Social Union's group in this parliamentary group will also go to "visit" Adenauer at the end of April for the same purpose.

According to reports, West German Chancellor Adenauer brought the text of the West German Constitution with him when he went to Italy. The newspaper reminds in this regard that it seems that Adenauer intends to maintain his original influence on West German government foreign policy even after he is elected president. Political observers believe that Adenauer's first speech after having to agree to nominate himself as a presidential candidate proved this intention. He said at the time, "The government's position on foreign policy will not change at all in the coming years..."

The Social Democratic Party's "Parliamentary Political News Bulletin" believes that the intention expressed by Adenauer in this passage is clearly contrary to the Constitution. Because the West German Constitution very clearly stipulates the powers of the President. For example, the President must not be a member of any political party. He has the right to attend various government meetings, but only has the right to speak. According to the Constitution, it is not the President who decides government policy, but the Chancellor who is responsible to the Parliament.

The press here believes that Adenauer may not be able to amend the corresponding constitutional provisions. Achieving this requires a two-thirds vote in the Federal Parliament, which Adenauer cannot obtain. However, Adenauer may take another path that he considers easier to reach, namely arbitrarily interpreting the constitutional provisions. It was not without purpose that he mentioned "the important powers of the President that have not been fully utilized until now" in a recent speech.

According to the "Parliamentary Political News Bulletin," Adenauer's State Secretary Globke has prepared certain "legal conclusions that Adenauer intends to use to achieve his goals." These conclusions can provide a "completely new interpretation" of certain constitutional provisions.

### 移地“休假”为名　幕后活动是实  阿登纳力图挣扎抓住实权

　　移地“休假”为名　幕后活动是实
　　阿登纳力图挣扎抓住实权
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：波恩消息：阿登纳目前在意大利科摩湖疗养地的“休假”，决不是一次普通的度假。据“星期日世界报”报道，在阿登纳在疗养地的住所中安装了一部电传打字机，昼夜不停地同波恩保持联系。这家报纸还报道说，“成批的政治专家”准备由波恩到意大利来“拜访”阿登纳，同他商谈继任他当西德总理的人选问题。
    据“星期日世界报”透露，西德著名银行家罗伯特·费尔德门格斯将是最近第一批“拜会”阿登纳的人之一。这位银行家同阿登纳有着非常亲密的关系。报纸认为，这位“银行家在挑选（总理）继任人问题上将说出举足轻重的话”。据说联邦议院基督教民主联盟议会党团主席和基督教社会联盟在这个党团里的小组主席也将在4月末为了同一目的去“拜访”阿登纳。
    据报纸报道，西德总理阿登纳前往意大利时随身携带着西德宪法的文本。报纸在这方面提醒说，看来，阿登纳打算在一旦自己当选总统后也能保持他原来对西德政府外交政策的影响。政治观察家认为，阿登纳在不得不同意提名自己为总统候选人后的第一次讲话，就证明了他的这种打算。他当时说，“政府在外交政策方面的立场在今后几年内……一点也不会改变”。
    社会民主党“议会政治新闻公报”认为，阿登纳在这段话中表示的意图显然同宪法相违背。因为西德的宪法十分明确地规定了总统的权力。例如，总统不得成为任何政党的党员。他有权参加政府的各种会议，但是只有发言权。根据宪法规定，决定政府政策的不是总统，而是要对议会负责的总理。
    此地新闻界认为，阿登纳未必能修改相应的宪法条文。做到这一点需要联邦议会三分之二的票数通过，而这是阿登纳得不到的。但是，阿登纳可能走另一条在他看来更容易到达的道路，即任意解释宪法条文的道路。他在最近一次演说中提到“直到现在还没有被充分利用的总统的重要权力”，这一点不是没有目的的。
    据“议会政治新闻公报”说，阿登纳的国务秘书格罗布克准备了某些“阿登纳打算用来达到自己目的的法律结论”。这些结论可以对某些宪法条文作“完全新的解释”。
