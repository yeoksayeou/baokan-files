Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic issued a statement warmly welcoming the Soviet government's statement of March 29 concerning the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council. Bulgarian and Albanian newspapers also published commentaries on this matter.

The Hungarian government, in a statement issued on April 1st, said that the Soviet government's proposal to conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty between members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization fully embodies the Soviet government's sincere desire for peace. As a member state of the Warsaw Treaty, Hungary is prepared to conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty with members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The statement emphasized that the Hungarian government supports the previous great efforts made by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to eliminate the Cold War and resolve international disputes by peaceful means, and now it is time to look again at the attitude of the governments of the North Atlantic Alliance countries.

The Hungarian government welcomes the Soviet government's position on holding a summit meeting and convening a foreign ministers' conference on May 11 regarding the Berlin situation and a peace treaty with Germany.

The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published a commentary on the 31st, saying that the proposal to conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization had long been formally put forward by the member states of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union, but this constructive proposal has not yet been adopted by Western countries. Now that life has raised it again, Western forces should treat it with a high degree of responsibility.

The commentary said that all peace-loving people, including the Bulgarian people, agree with the Soviet proposals and firmly advocate that the West accept them.

The Albanian newspaper "Zeri i Popullit" also published an editorial on the Soviet statement, saying that the realization of this Soviet government proposal would guarantee a change in the current international situation, enhance friendly relations between countries, and create an atmosphere of trust.

The editorial believes that it is appropriate to convene a summit meeting quickly. The Soviet proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and normalize the situation in West Berlin is an important task that needs to be resolved urgently.

    新华社1日讯　匈牙利人民共和国政府发表声明，热烈欢迎苏联政府3月29日就北大西洋公约组织理事会即将开会所发表的声明。保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的报纸也为此发表评论。
    匈牙利政府在1日发表的声明中说，苏联政府声明中提出的关于华沙条约成员国和北大西洋公约组织成员国之间签订互不侵犯条约的建议充分体现了苏联政府真诚的和平愿望。作为华沙条约成员国，匈牙利准备同北大西洋公约组织成员国缔结互不侵犯条约。声明强调指出，匈牙利政府支持苏联和其他社会主义国家政府以前所作出的旨在消除冷战和用和平方法来解决国际争端方面的巨大努力，现在就要再次看北大西洋联盟各国政府的态度了。
    匈牙利政府欢迎苏联政府关于召开最高级会议和在5月11日就柏林局势和对德和约召开外交部长会议的立场。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”31日发表评论说，北大西洋公约组织同华沙条约之间签订互不侵犯条约的建议，早就由华沙条约成员国和苏联正式提出过，但是，这一建设性的提议至今尚未被西方国家所采纳。现在，生活又重新提出它来，西方势力应该以高度的责任感来对待它。
    评论说，所有爱好和平的人民，其中包括保加利亚人民在内，都赞同苏联的建议，并坚决主张西方接受这些建议。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”也就苏联这个声明发表社论说，苏联政府这一建议的实现将能保证改变当前的国际形势、增强各国的友好关系和建立信任的气氛。
    社论认为，迅速召开最高级会议是适宜的。苏联提出缔结对德和约和使西柏林局势正常化的建议是急待解决的重要任务。
