Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 23rd: The troops of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, acting on orders to suppress the extremely heinous Tibetan traitorous group, have achieved great victory in the Shannan area after thoroughly quelling the rebellion in the Lhasa area. Our army, after ten days of deployment and a thousand miles of rapid advance, completely crushed the bandit strongholds. Our army has now controlled the vast area south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and north of the Himalayas.

After quickly quelling the rebellion in Lhasa, the People's Liberation Army suppression force marched south from Lhasa on April 8th, dividing into eastern, western, and central routes to cross the Yarlung Tsangpo River and launch a sweeping campaign against the rebels who were still catching their breath. Under the pursuit of our various armies, the rebels collapsed at the first touch and fled in disarray. After more than ten days of fighting, our army successively captured more than thirty *zong* (districts) and villages south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, east of Gyantse, north of the Himalayas, and west of Tsela Dzong, including Renben Zong, Lajiali, Naidong Zong, Tsedang, Poshang Xika, Qonggyai Zong, Zhaki, Zhanang, Zhegu Zong, Dama Zong, Lakang Zong, Shengge Zong, Duo Zong, Longzi Zong, Jiayu Zong, Juela Xika, Gongga Zong, Cuola Zong, Langkazi Zong, Lingxi, Baidi Zong, Dalong Zong, Jiede Xiu, Laxi Xika, Gululangjie Zong, Lang Zong, Jindong Zong, Xiajiang, Xialuo, and Ke Zong. We also crushed the rebel armed forces entrenched in various places, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly two thousand enemies. As of the morning of the 21st, our army had occupied Ping Shankou, Kada, and other places. By this point, all border strongholds in the Shannan area and the northern Himalayas were completely under our army's control. Under our heavy blow, the rebel bandits disintegrated. In addition to those annihilated, many coerced elements deserted the rebel ranks, surrendered their weapons to the People's Liberation Army, and returned home to production. A portion of the rebels fled to India. Now only a few remnants have fled into remote mountainous areas. Our army, with the active support of the local Tibetan people, is taking advantage of the victory to pursue and suppress scattered bandits and will soon wipe them out.

While carrying out military suppression, the People's Liberation Army's suppression forces quickly established military control organizations in various parts of Shannan, destroyed the reactionary regime that had long harmed the local people, and provided relief to the local people who had been harmed by the bandits. The Tibetan people in the Shannan area completely stood on the side of the People's Liberation Army, warmly supporting the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly quelling the rebellion. As soon as the army arrived, they were like meeting relatives they had not seen for a long time, angrily denouncing the rebels' heinous crimes to the People's Liberation Army and demanding that the People's Liberation Army avenge them. When they saw the seals, armies, and whips of the reactionary regime, which had long cruelly murdered the Tibetan people, being abolished, they were even more ecstatic. The Tibetans all said: The three great mountains (referring to the seals, armies, and whips of the reactionary regime) pressing down on us have been overthrown, and from now on we have been liberated. The Tibetans burned incense and prostrated themselves, celebrating their new life, and thanked the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army as their saviors.

In the suppression battles, the People's Liberation Army maintained strict discipline and strictly implemented the Party's ethnic and religious policies. Wherever the army went, it did not violate the slightest thing. The actions of the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers in enthusiastically helping the masses with spring plowing and treating the sick on the march have become a popular story among the local people. The vast number of patriotic monks and laypeople in the Shannan area also actively supported the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebellion with various practical actions. They enthusiastically burned salty tea for the People's Liberation Army to drink, gave their houses to the People's Liberation Army to live in, and voluntarily led the way through the snow to pursue and annihilate the remnant bandits. The Tibetan farmers in Gongga, Tsedang, Naidong, Jiede Xiu, Zhaki, and other *zong* (districts) along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, who had long suffered from the rebels' ravages, also spontaneously organized themselves to repair the roads and bridges destroyed by the rebels, paving the way for the People's Liberation Army to advance. Many Tibetan people also voluntarily drove yaks and mules to transport grain and supplies for the People's Liberation Army. They firmly stated: For the great cause of the unification of the motherland, for the new life of Tibet, and for living a happy life forever, we must thoroughly eliminate the rebels. Wherever the People's Liberation Army goes, we will resolutely support them.

The Shannan area is located southeast of Lhasa, south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, and north of the Himalayas, bordering India and Bhutan. For a long time, rebel elements headed by Enzhu Cang·Gongbu Zhaxi, Jiacang, and Sanduo Cang, under the instigation of the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary groups, colluded with imperialists and foreign reactionaries to carry out rebellious activities against the motherland. They constantly accepted weapons imported from abroad and air drops from foreign aircraft of unknown nationality, engaging in criminal activities of sabotaging transportation, looting property, raping, burning, killing, and harming the people. In the Lhasa rebellion, Enzhu Cang·Gongbu Zhaxi's bandits were also one of the main forces. At present, this group of bandits has been quickly crushed by the People's Liberation Army. This is of great significance for accelerating the suppression of the rebellion in the Tibetan area.

    出师十日  奔袭千里  踏破匪巢
    我军一举荡平西藏山南叛匪
    完全控制山南地区和喜马拉雅山北部所有边境要点
    大军所到之处藏族人民欢欣若狂积极支援追剿残匪
    新华社拉萨23日电　人民解放军西藏军区部队奉命对罪大恶极的西藏叛国集团进行讨伐，继彻底平息拉萨地区叛乱之后，又在山南地区获得了很大胜利。我军出师十日，奔袭千里，一举荡平了叛匪盘踞的巢穴。我军已控制了雅鲁藏布江以南、喜马拉雅山以北的广大地区。
    人民解放军平叛部队，在迅速平定拉萨叛乱之后，于4月8日由拉萨挥师南下，分东、西、中三路渡过雅鲁藏布江，对喘息未定的叛匪展开扫荡。叛匪在我各路大军追剿之下，一触即溃，狼狈逃窜。经过十多天的战斗，我军先后攻占了雅鲁藏布江以南、江孜以东、喜马拉雅山以北、则拉宗以西的仁本宗、拉加里、乃东宗、泽当、颇章溪卡、琼结宗、札期、札囊、哲古宗、达马宗、拉康宗、生格宗、多宗、隆子宗、加玉宗、觉拉溪卡、贡戛宗、错拉宗、浪卡子宗、岭溪、白地宗、打隆宗、杰得秀、拉绥溪、古如郎杰宗、郎宗、金东宗、下江、下洛、克宗等三十多个宗（溪）和广大村庄，并分别粉碎了盘踞在各地的叛乱武装，毙伤俘敌近二千人。截至21日晨止，我军已进占平山口、卡达等地。至此，山南地区和喜马拉雅山北部的所有边境要点已全部在我军控制之下。叛匪在我沉重打击之下，土崩瓦解，除被歼灭者外，许多被裹胁的分子纷纷脱离叛匪队伍，向人民解放军缴交武器回家生产，一部分叛乱分子逃往印度。现在只有少数残匪窜入偏僻山区。我军正在当地藏族人民的积极支援下，乘胜追剿零散叛匪，不日即可肃清。
    人民解放军平叛大军在进行军事清剿的同时，迅速在山南各地普遍建立了军事管制机构，摧毁了长期残害当地人民的反动政权，并对遭受叛匪残害的当地人民进行了救济。山南地区藏族人民完全站在解放军这一边，热烈拥护人民解放军彻底平息叛乱。大军一到，他们就像遇见久别重逢的亲人一样，愤怒地向解放军控诉叛匪的滔天罪行，要求解放军为他们报仇。当他们看到反动政权长期残酷杀害藏族人民的印鉴、军队和法鞭被取缔的时候，更是欢欣若狂，藏民们都说：压在我们身上的三座大山（指反动政权的印、军队和法鞭）被推翻了，从此我们翻身了。藏民们纷纷焚香顶礼，欢庆新生，同声感激共产党和解放军为救命恩人。
    人民解放军在平叛战斗中，纪律严明，严格执行党的民族政策、宗教政策。大军过处，秋毫无犯。解放军官兵在进军途中热情帮助群众春耕、治伤治病的行动，已被当地人民传为佳话。山南地区广大僧俗爱国人民也以各种实际行动积极支援解放军讨平叛乱。他们热情地烧咸茶给解放军喝，让房屋给解放军住，自动地为解放军踏雪引路，追歼残匪。长期遭受叛匪蹂躏的雅鲁藏布江沿岸的贡戛、泽当、乃东、杰得秀、札期等宗溪的藏族农民，还纷纷自动组织起来，抢修被叛匪破坏的公路和桥梁，为解放军整修前进的道路。许多藏族人民并且自动地赶着牦牛和骡马为人民解放军运送粮食和物资。他们坚决表示：为了祖国的统一大业，为了西藏的新生，为了永远过幸福的生活，一定要彻底肃清叛乱分子，解放军到哪里，就坚决支援到哪里。
    山南地区位于拉萨东南，在雅鲁藏布江以南、喜马拉雅山以北，是我国和印度、不丹接壤的边境地区。长期以来，以恩珠仓·公布扎西、甲马仓、三多仓为首的叛乱分子，在原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的指使下，勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，进行背叛祖国的叛乱活动。他们不断接受从外国输入的武器和不明国籍的外国飞机的空投接济，进行破坏交通、劫掠财物、奸淫烧杀、残害人民的罪恶活动。在拉萨叛乱中，恩珠仓·公布扎西股匪也是主力之一。目前，这股叛匪已被人民解放军迅速粉碎。这对于加速平息西藏地区的叛乱，有着重大的意义。
