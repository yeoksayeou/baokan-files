    "Ji Chang Learns Archery"
    Wang Chong
    
    There is a story in "Liezi" about Ji Chang learning archery, the gist of which is: There was an archery master named Fei Wei, and he took a young apprentice named Ji Chang. As soon as Ji Chang arrived, he asked his master to quickly teach him all his skills. Fei Wei said, "Not so fast! You must first learn the basic movements. Stare intently at a target, and don't blink." After Ji Chang returned home, he stood next to his wife's loom and stared intently at the shuttle going back and forth. After two years, his eyesight was excellent, and even if someone pricked his eyelids with an awl, his eyes wouldn't blink. So Ji Chang went to his master and asked to learn archery quickly. But Fei Wei said again, "Not so fast! You haven't mastered the basic movements yet. Now you need to sharpen your vision so that you can make small things look big." After Ji Chang returned, he tied a louse with a hair and hung it in a distant window, watching it every day. After ten days or so, he gradually felt that it was getting bigger; after three years, he felt that the louse was as big as a wheel, and when he looked at other things, they were like huge mountains. So he used a small bow and arrow to try to shoot the louse, and he hit the center of the louse exactly, without even touching the hair. At this time, he told his master again, and Fei Wei happily said, "Good boy! Now you've mastered the skills, you can start learning archery!" Sure enough, Ji Chang quickly became the most famous archer. (See "Liezi · Tang Wen Fifth")
    
    Archery should first go through the most basic training. Isn't our learning the same way now? If we don't first learn basic knowledge, then we can't delve into higher scientific theories. This principle is very obvious, however, as far as I know, some young friends regard learning basic theoretical knowledge as dispensable, and belittle the positive role of basic theoretical knowledge. They say: "We students talk about cells all day long, but farmers haven't learned biology, yet they still produce thousands of catties of wheat per mu, and raise big, fat pigs." The implication is that if learning biology doesn't immediately make one mu of wheat produce thousands of catties, or raise several thousand-catties heavy fat pigs, then learning is meaningless. Such a view is too simplistic. Of course, the purpose of our learning is to apply theory to practice, and to make science serve production and construction. We are precisely moving in this correct direction. However, this is not immediately effective, and our vision should be further. Take farmers with rich experience in high yields, for example, they also need to study science, analyze and summarize their experience, find out the reasons for increased production, and improve themselves. Learning science is needed by everyone. We must highly respect the basic theoretical knowledge that our predecessors have gained in practice and verified in practice. If you want to advance in science like playing checkers, surpassing basic theoretical knowledge, it is impossible to learn well.
    
    Some young friends think that some basic theoretical knowledge is too simple and seems boring to learn. We should understand that everything basic is relatively simple, even monotonous, but it is very important. Without the simple, it is impossible to develop into the complex; without the monotonous, it is impossible to evolve into the diverse. If there weren't single-celled organisms in the world first, how could they have evolved into higher animals? Singers always start by practicing the most basic vocalization; calligraphers also always start by learning the simplest strokes. Isn't the same true of learning culture and science?
    
    Marx said long ago: "At the entrance to science, just like at the entrance to hell, one must make the following demand: 'Here all doubts must be abandoned, all cowardly thoughts must be eliminated.'" (See "Selected Works of Marx and Engels", Two-Volume Edition, Volume 1, page 343, Moscow Chinese Edition) Thinking that basic knowledge is unimportant, or thinking that it is too simple and not interesting enough, are all manifestations of cowardice and should be abandoned. Let us bring out the spirit of Ji Chang learning archery, practice our most basic eyesight well, and then we will be able to hit the bullseye every time and understand everything!

    “纪昌学射”
    王重
    “列子”中有一段纪昌学射的故事，大意是：有个射箭的神手名叫飞卫，他收了一个年轻的徒弟名叫纪昌。纪昌一来就要求师父赶快把一切功夫都教给他。飞卫说：“且慢！你首先要学习基本的动作。用眼睛死死地盯住一个目标，不能任意眨眼”。纪昌回去之后，站在妻子的织布机旁边，死死地盯着来来往往的梭子。两年之后，他的眼力很好了，纵使有人用锥子刺他的眼皮，他的眼睛也不眨一眨。于是纪昌去找师父，要求快些学习射箭。飞卫却又说：“且慢！你的基本动作还没有学全呢，现在你要把目光练得非常锐利，使自己看小东西也能变成大东西。”纪昌回去之后，用头发缚了一只虱子，把它挂在远远的窗口，天天看着它。十几天之后，渐渐觉得变大了；三年之后，感到虱子像车轮那么大了，再看看别的东西，简直就像一座大山一般。于是他就用一副小小的弓箭试射那只虱子，正好穿过虱子的中央，连头发也没有碰上。这时候，他再告诉师父，飞卫高兴地说：“好小子！这一下你的功夫学到家了，可以开始学习射箭了！”果然，纪昌很快就成为最有名的射手了。（见“列子·汤问第五”）
    射箭应该首先经过最基本的训练。现在我们的学习又何尝不是如此呢？若是不先学习基础知识，那么就无法钻研更高深的科学理论了。这个道理本来是很明显的，然而，据我所知，有些青年朋友却把学习基础理论知识看成可有可无的，贬低了基础理论知识的积极作用。他们说：“我们整天学生物谈什么细胞，农民没学过生物，照样亩产小麦几千斤，照样养大号肥猪。”言外之意，如果学了生物学之后，不能马上使一亩小麦长出几千斤，养几头千斤重的大肥猪，学习就没什么意义似的。这样看问题未免太简单化了。当然，我们学习的目的是要把理论应用于实践，使科学为生产建设服务。我们也正是朝着这个正确的方向做去的。但是，这不是立竿见影，立刻见效的，我们的目光应该看得更远一些。就拿有丰产经验的农民来说，他们也需要学习科学，分析和总结自己的经验，找出增产的原因，提高自己。学习科学是每一个人都需要的。我们要十分尊重前人在实践中得来又在实践中验证的基础理论知识。要想在科学上像走跳棋一样，超越基本理论知识，那是不可能学好的。
    有些青年朋友认为某些基础理论知识太简单，学起来似乎很乏味。我们应该明白：一切基本的东西都是比较简单的，甚至是单调的，然而却是非常重要的。没有简单的，就不可能发展成为复杂的；没有单调的，也不可能演变成为多样的。如果世界上不是先有单细胞生物，哪能会进化成高等动物？歌唱家总是先从最基本的发声开始练习的；书法家也总是先学习最简单的笔划。学习文化科学又何尝不是这个道理呢？
    马克思早就说过：“在科学的门口，正像在地狱的门口一样，必须提出如下一个要求：‘在这里一切的疑惧都须抛弃，一切怯懦的念头在这里都须化除。’”（见“马克思、恩格斯文选”两卷集，第一卷，343页，莫斯科中文版）认为基础知识是不重要，或是认为太简单而不够味儿的思想都是怯懦的一种表现形式，都是应该加以抛弃的。让我们拿出纪昌学射的精神，把最基本的目力练好，那我们就能百发百中，一通百通了！
