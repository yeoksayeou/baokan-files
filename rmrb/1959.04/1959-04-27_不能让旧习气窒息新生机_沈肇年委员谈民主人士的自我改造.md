Chairman, fellow committee members:

At the Third Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC, I listened to the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee delivered by Vice Chairman Li Weihan, the report on the draft national economic plan for 1959 delivered by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and the report on the 1958 state final accounts and the 1959 state budget draft delivered by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. I wholeheartedly agree with them. I also attended the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and listened to the government work report delivered by Premier Zhou. I am extremely delighted and sincerely support it.

I am a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) and also a bourgeois intellectual. I participated in the collective plan for democratic personages above the level of bureau directors in Hubei Province to exert greater effort, strive for progress, and accelerate their fundamental self-remolding. I also formulated a personal self-remolding plan, confided in the Party, carried out self-remolding, and resolutely followed the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao. I constantly examined myself and engaged in criticism when encountering things. I strived to be both red and expert in my work and tried to do more for the people. However, I am too deeply influenced by the old society. Originally, with the two paths of capitalism and socialism laid out before me, it was not difficult to distinguish between right and wrong. Yet, I sometimes confused right and wrong and failed to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. My position and viewpoints on socialism were often vague. This is the remnant of bourgeois ideology at play. If I do not thoroughly remold myself with a spirit of transformation, I will inevitably have new vitality stifled by outdated habits. So-called promoting the proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology is the key to fundamental remolding, and I should take steps forward in this regard. As for the length and steps of the remolding period, I initially thought that ideology and position could be separated into two steps: first stabilize the remolding of position, and then remold ideology. After two self-examinations, I deeply realized that position and ideology are inseparable. Ideological remolding is complex, arduous, repetitive, and long-term, and position must be expressed through ideology. Of course, both position and ideology must be remolded together. Therefore, my self-remolding plan was initially set for two years to become a firm leftist, but now it has been changed to five years. During these five years, I will make extra efforts and study diligently in order to get out of the intermediate state as early as possible.

The following is about the gains from visiting the people's communes. The people's commune is the most progressive grassroots unit in our socialist society. It is a social organization that combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and it is also the best form for the future transition from socialism to communism. Therefore, in less than a year after the start of the communization movement, the number of farmers participating in the communes reached more than 99% of the total number of farmers in the country. Its superiority is indescribable and incomparable. Now the progress of various productions is advancing rapidly, but the most lacking thing is labor. In addition to rural women already participating in agricultural production, some urban women are still bound by household chores because urban people's communes are generally not busy with large-scale operations, and their labor has not yet been liberated. I visited the Dongfanghong, Xianfeng, and Shijin people's communes in Wuhan City this time and was greatly encouraged. Other visiting comrades have already reported on the production and organizational situation of these communes, so I will not repeat them. What I want to say is that the communes have established some small and medium-sized factories, and the majority of women participating in labor are happy and lively, especially the women who lead the work, which is well-organized. For example, the finished products manufactured by the yarn-wrapped wire factory using waste parts are welcomed by other factories and households. For example, there are many blind and deaf-mute people participating in production in the ironware factory. The operation is natural, whether hammering iron or pulling bellows, and there is no feeling of inconvenience. Wuhan City has established nine people's communes. Anyone who can participate in work within the scope of the commune has obtained a job. As for the elderly, weak, disabled, or those who can work, they are assigned easy jobs in nursing homes, kindergartens, or nurseries. Especially the Happiness Home run by the Civil Affairs Bureau has neat equipment, and the elderly, weak, disabled, and mentally ill are all properly settled. This is a problem that has been difficult to solve for many years, but now it has been solved. It truly achieves "the elderly are provided for, the young are brought up, and the lonely and disabled are cared for."

Finally, let me introduce the progress of compiling the local chronicles of Hubei Province. I work in the Hubei Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History, and my main task is to participate in the compilation of simplified chronicles of counties and cities by the Local Chronicles Committee. Since receiving instructions from the State Council and obtaining guidance from Mr. Dong Biwu, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee appointed Vice Governor Meng Futang in 1957 to preside over the establishment of the Local Chronicles Compilation Committee and began compiling simplified chronicles of counties and cities. At first, it was divided into interview and compilation groups. As the work gradually unfolded, the interview and compilation expanded successively and were each divided into three groups. The three interview groups went to various counties and cities to conduct on-site interviews according to the detailed items ordered. The obtained data was sent to the province one after another for review and compilation, and then printed into books. As of now, data from 29 counties and cities has been collected. The books that have been compiled and printed are Xianning, Xishui, and Huangmei counties; the books that have been sent to print but have not yet been published are Guangji, Yingcheng, Xiaogan, Hanchuan, Echeng, Qichun, Yingshan, and Luotian counties; the books that are being reviewed and sorted out are Macheng, Dawu, Yunmeng, Hong'an, Huanggang, Xinzhou, and Huangshi City; the books that are being compiled and are awaiting review are Yangxin, Xiangyang, Xiangfan City, Anlu, Tianmen, Puqi, and Yingshan counties and cities; the books that are being obtained and are awaiting review and compilation are Jiangling, Shashi, Jingshan, and Daye counties and cities. In addition, there are four counties and cities, namely Mianyang, Jianli, Yichang and Yichang City, that are currently conducting interviews. Shishou County is now using the method of self-collection, self-compilation, and self-publication. After seeing this method, the comrades of the Compilation Committee also plan to occasionally adopt the method of collecting and compiling on the spot. Mianyang County has decided to adopt the Shishou method, and the Provincial Local Chronicles Compilation Committee has sent two compilers to assist. Jianli and Yichang are under discussion because the province has not assigned anyone to be added. The compilation of simplified chronicles of various counties and cities is roughly the situation at the current stage.

When this work began, many responsible comrades in the cultural and historical work of various provinces sent letters inquiring about the methods of compiling local chronicles. At that time, because the matter belonged to the original creation, there was no plan to introduce it, and I was deeply sorry. Now, socialist construction in various areas is making great strides forward, and new things are increasing day by day. In order to meet the reference needs of the people, we must also follow the great leap forward. All descriptions of various things are based on the data collected by each county and city itself. For example, if the data of a certain county and city was collected on a certain day of a certain month last year, the things written are up to that day of that month last year. If the data of a certain county and city was collected on a certain day of a certain month this year, the things written are up to that day of that month this year (for example, the high number of rice yield per mu in Macheng County was before the interview data, so it was able to be written into the simplified chronicle; the high number of rice yield per mu in Yingcheng County was after the interview data, so it could not be written in). The so-called "breaking dynasty" method used in compiling history in the past is no longer applicable.

Please indicate whether the above points are appropriate.

    不能让旧习气窒息新生机
    沈肇年委员谈民主人士的自我改造主席，各位委员：
    在本会第三届第一次会议上，听了李维汉副主席所作第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，李富春副总理所作的一九五九年度国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理所作一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，我极端赞成。又列席第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，听了周总理所作政府工作报告，我是极其欢欣鼓舞，并竭诚拥护。
    我是民革成员，也是一个资产阶级知识分子。我曾参加湖北省厅局长以上民主人士鼓足干劲、力争上游、加速自我根本改造的集体规划，并订立了个人自我改造规划，向党交心，进行自我改造，坚决依照毛主席指示的六项政治标准，在接触事物上，随时检查自己，展开批评，在工作岗位上，力求又红又专，争取为人民多做一点事情。但是，我在旧社会里习染太深，本来资本主义与社会主义两条道路，摆在面前，孰是孰非，不难明辨，而我竟有时是非混淆，敌我不分，对于社会主义的立场观点往往模糊不清，这就是资产阶级思想残余在作祟，如不切切实实、以脱胎换骨的精神彻底改造自己，就不免为陈腐习气窒息新的生机。所谓兴无灭资，才是根本改造的关键，应当就此迈步前进。至于改造时间的长短和步骤，我初以为思想与立场可以分两步，先把立场改造稳定，然后改造思想。经过两次检查以来，才深深感到立场与思想是分不开的，思想改造是复杂、艰巨、反复和长期的，而立场又须从思想上表现，当然立场与思想都要一同改造。因此，我的自我改造规划，先是定两年成为坚定的左派，现在则改为五年了。在这五年中，我要特加努力，认真学习，以期提早脱离中间状态。
    以下谈谈关于视察人民公社的收获。人民公社是我国社会主义社会最进步的基层单位，它是工农商学兵相结合和政社合一的社会组织，也是由社会主义将来过渡到共产主义的最好的形式。所以公社化运动开始后不到一年的时间，参加公社的农户就达到全国农户总数的百分之九十九以上，其优越性实在是无可形容和比拟的，现在各种生产进度都是一日千里，但最感不够的是劳动力，除农村妇女业已参加农业生产外，而城市人民公社因为一般不忙大量兴办，所以有些城市妇女还束缚在家庭琐事之中，她们的劳动力尚未得到解放。我此次参观了武汉市的东方红、先锋、时进等三个人民公社，受到了极大的鼓舞。关于这些公社的生产和组织情况，已有其他视察同志报告，我不再赘述，我所要说的就是公社兴办了一些中小型工厂，参加劳动的妇女占多数，都是欢欣活泼，尤其是妇女领工，井井有条，如纱包线厂利用废件制造的成品，为其他各厂户所乐用。又如铁器工厂中有许多盲哑人参加生产，操作自然，或捶铁或拉风箱，都不感到有何不便。武汉市已办起九个人民公社，凡在公社范围内可能参加工作的，都获得了工作的岗位，至于老弱废疾者，或在敬老院，或在幼儿园，或在托儿所，或有可以工作的，都分配了轻便的工作，尤其是民政局所办之幸福院，设备整齐，老弱残废以及精神病人，都各有安顿，这是多年所难得解决的事，现在都解决了。真正做到了“老有所终，幼有所长，孤独废疾者皆有所养”。
  最后再介绍一下关于纂修湖北省方志的进展情况。我是在湖北省文史研究馆工作，主要工作是参加方志委员会纂修各县、市的简志。自从接到国务院指示和获得董必武先生的指导以后，湖北省人民委员会便于一九五七年指定孟夫唐副省长主持组设方志纂修委员会，开始纂修县、市简志。先是分采访编纂两组进行，随工作逐渐展开，采访编纂相继扩展而各分三组。采访三组分赴各县市依照所订细目，实地采访，所得资料陆续寄省，分核编纂，审印成书。截至现在止，计采访了二十九个县、市的资料。这些资料已编印成书的有咸宁、浠水、黄梅三县；已付印尚未出书的有广济、应城、孝感、汉川、鄂城、蕲春、英山、罗田八县；正在审核整理的有麻城、大悟、云梦、红安、黄岗、新洲、黄石市七个县、市；正在编纂待审的有阳新、襄阳、襄樊市、安陆、天门、蒲圻、应山七个县、市；正取得资料尚待审编的有江陵、沙市、京山、大冶四个县、市；此外尚有沔阳、监利、宜昌和宜昌市等四个县、市，正在进行采访。石首县现在是自采自编自出版的办法，纂修委员会的同志们看到这个办法后，也准备间或采取就地边采边编的办法，沔阳县已经确定采取石首的办法，并由省方志纂修委员会派编纂二人协助。监利、宜昌因省无人加派，正在磋商中。编纂各县、市简志，在现阶段的办理情形，大致如是。
    在这一工作开始时，各省文史工作方面有许多负责同志函询有关编纂方志的办法，当时以事属创始，未有规划介绍，深为抱歉。现在社会主义各项建设，均在大大跃进，新的事物日有增加，我们为了适应人民的参考需要，也不能不跟随跃进，所有各项事物的叙述，都是就各个县、市本身采得资料为主，如某某县、市资料系上年某月某日采得的，其所写事物，即截至上年某月某日为止，某某县、市资料系今年某月某日采得的，其所写事物，即截至今年某月某日为止（例如麻城县的稻谷亩产高额数字，系在采访资料以前，所以能够写入简志；应城县的稻谷亩产高额数字系在采访资料以后，即未能叙入）。在往日纂修史乘，所谓“断代”的办法，就不适用了。
    以上所述各点，是否适当，均请指示。
