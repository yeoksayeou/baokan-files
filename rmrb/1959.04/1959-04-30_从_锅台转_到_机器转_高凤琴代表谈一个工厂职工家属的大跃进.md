Title: From "Turning the Cooking Stove" to "Turning the Machine"
Representative Gao Fengqin talks about the Great Leap Forward of a factory workers' family

Presidium, fellow representatives:
    I completely agree with and support the work reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. Premier Zhou's report has given me a profound education and great encouragement. I will definitely work according to the spirit of the report and do a better job in the family work of our factory.
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, the families of workers worked hard and diligently, participating in various productions. Many people went from being laymen to experts, creating 200,000 yuan of wealth for the country.
    In the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party, our factory's family work, based on the Party's policy of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift, has done a lot of work and achieved certain results in serving factory production, promoting family mutual assistance, and achieving "five-good" families. Especially in the all-round Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, inspired and encouraged by the moving deeds such as the entire factory's workers engaging in technical revolution using the "ants gnawing at bones" method to manufacture China's first nitrogen fertilizer equipment, and the labor model Wei Fengying completing the workload of the second five-year plan in four months, we further overcame our sense of inferiority, broke down superstitions, liberated our minds, and were full of energy. Everyone was determined to contribute their strength to the cause of socialist construction and actively participated in various labors in the factory's Great Leap Forward that our families could participate in; various welfare undertakings were organized, so that families were liberated from trivial housework, "moving from turning the cooking stove to turning the machine." Up to now, 1,098 of our factory's family members have become contract workers in the factory, more than 700 have become workers in factories run by family members, and more than 900 have participated in welfare industries. This is a remarkable event and a great joy for our factory workers' families. Now, I would like to give a brief report to the conference on the changes in our factory's family work over the past year.
    When the Great Leap Forward movement was launched vigorously last year, our families did not lag behind. We also participated in the Great Leap Forward movement in the same way, acted quickly to obey organizational arrangements, went wherever the Party wanted us to go, and did whatever we were told to do. For example, when some raw materials in the factory were in short supply, the entire factory launched a "five-digging movement." Our families immediately responded to the call of the Party committee and launched a treasure-digging movement focusing on digging iron and steel. Everyone was very enthusiastic, from children aged six or seven to old people aged sixty or seventy, all participated in the race to support production. In just over a month, we dug out 254.5 tons of iron and steel, 11 tons of hardware, 1,000 tons of refractory bricks, 120,000 catties of firewood, 700,000 bricks, and many other materials. The steel, iron, copper, and refractory bricks alone saved the country 45,412 yuan of wealth. For example, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor in the factory, we organized families to help unload trucks. It only took 40 minutes to unload a truckload of bricks without damaging a single one, and the quality was even better than that completed by male workers, which was praised by the leadership.
    After the Party issued the call for the whole Party and the whole people to run industry and the people's commune movement, under the leadership of the Party committee, we actively ran factories and participated in industrial production labor. In order to lead us to run the factories well, the Party committee first convened a meeting of factory and family cadres, conducted debates, clarified many understandings, and determined that the principle of family-run industry must be that large factories help small factories, and small factories serve large factories. This gave us great support and encouragement. Therefore, we were full of energy and strengthened our confidence and determination to overcome difficulties. We proposed to be simple and crude, start from scratch, not ask the state for money, not ask the factory for equipment, and rely on our own efforts to start production. The factory trade union also organized a competition among all the factory workers' families to compare ideas, compare energy, and compare methods. The families of workers worked enthusiastically, day and night, looking everywhere for waste materials, waste resources, and sources of work. If they didn't understand, they asked workers; if they couldn't do it, they asked workers for help. In this way, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the workers, we used the old waste materials we picked up to build sixteen factory buildings, canteens, and nurseries, totaling 1,144 square meters. Eleven small factories were established (including paper bags, hardware, casting, cement, wooden boxes, cardboard boxes, grass bags, sewing, etc.). In just a few months, we learned woodworking, casting, bricklaying, turning, cement working, and other technologies, changed from laymen to experts, and created 200,000 yuan of wealth for the country. The workers said: "Family members are really capable, and we can't say that family members only know how to take care of children and do housework."
    After family members participated in social labor, getting rid of the burden of housework and children became an urgent problem to be solved. Under the leadership and support of the Party, we adopted the method of everyone working together, first decentralized and then centralized, and set up 134 nurseries, 15 canteens, and 4 service stations, which basically solved the difficulties of family members participating in social labor. In running welfare undertakings, we opposed the dependent thinking of "reaching out for money, you run it and I enjoy it," and adopted the method of being simple and crude, adapting to local conditions, and doing good things without spending money or spending less money. For example, the wood, bricks, tiles, and labor used to build the canteen, and even the furniture used for eating, were completely dug, picked, borrowed, and donated by the family members themselves. The houses used by the nurseries were all voluntarily donated by the family members. They were used as nurseries during the day and as dormitories at night. The mistress of the house was the child-care worker. These child-care workers were all selected from among the family members who had good ideas and loved children. They took care of the children patiently, allowing them to eat well, play well, and sleep well, cultivated the children's collective living habits, and ensured that the children's mothers could work and study with peace of mind. All the furniture used in the nurseries was also brought by the children's mothers and family members.
    The service station solved the difficulties of washing, sewing, disassembling, repairing, and buying daily necessities for the family members.
    Because the Party led our women from trivial housework to social labor, and collectivization solved the difficulties of participating in social labor, the family members have undergone great changes in their economic status and mental outlook.
    In terms of family life and economic status, in the past, being considered as eating other people's food, I always felt guilty in my heart. Now, not only can I support myself, but also improve the family's living standards. According to a survey of 86 family members participating in social labor, the family population is 480 people. The average monthly living expenses per person were originally 13 yuan, but now they have increased to 17.35 yuan. The factory's expenditure on relief funds has also been greatly reduced. Many households that are often in difficulty no longer need relief.
    Common labor improves interpersonal relationships and changes people's mental outlook.
    The mental outlook of family members is also very different from the past. In politics, they are eager to make progress, and many people have proposed to strive to join the Party. For example, contract worker Wang Liying, who used to be a member of the fourth family committee, is active in production after entering the factory, obeys organizational arrangements, overfulfills tasks, and can help others. At the end of last year, she was rated as an advanced producer. She proposed not to be arrogant or impatient, to continue to train herself, and strive to reach the level of a probationary party member. Such family members are not individual cases. Among the 180 contract workers in the 22nd workshop, 37 are advanced producers and red flag bearers. The family members who work in the factories run by family members are full of energy, treating the factory as their home, coming early and leaving late. At the "March 8th" festival conference, they competed with the factory workers. They proposed to complete a year's task in half a year. The small hardware factory made "cast tops." The planned target for March was 1,727 kilograms, but the actual completion was 3,734 kilograms. In the past, when family members got together, they would talk about the shortcomings of one family or another, which caused disunity. Now, when they get together, they talk about production and learning.
    There have also been changes in family relations, strengthening the unity between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, between husbands and wives, and between neighbors. The phenomenon of family disputes and neighborhood disputes has been greatly reduced. At the beginning of last year, there were still 51 households in the entire factory where mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law were incompatible. Now, 42 households have changed and established new family relationships of mutual respect and mutual assistance. For example, after Meng Shuqin participated in social labor, she took the initiative to talk to her mother-in-law, gave her a few yuan of pocket money every month, and often bought something for the old woman to eat. The old woman was very touched and took the initiative to take care of the children and housework, turning into a harmonious family. The old lady said everywhere: "Participating in production is great, it has also improved our family relationship. This is all thanks to the good leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao."
    The entire family, whether in production, life, or ideology, has made great progress. This is all the result of the Party's leadership. We thank the Party for its correct leadership. We shout long live the Communist Party!
    Although our families have made a lot of progress in production, life, and ideology under the leadership of the Party, we still have many shortcomings and many problems in our work. We are determined to better study politics, culture, and technology in the Great Leap Forward of 1959, improve our ability to build socialism and our communist awareness, and use the spirit of hard work, arduous work, and clever work to engage in technical revolution and mass movements. Relying on the leadership of the Party and the help of workers, without asking the state for materials or equipment, we will gradually improve our existing small factories using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to better meet the needs of the country.
    While doing a good job in production, we must do a good job in collective welfare undertakings. We guarantee that we will not ask the state for money or things, and we will use our own strength to do a good job in collective welfare undertakings such as canteens and nurseries, to better serve production and serve the masses.
    At the same time, we must also do a good job in the work of family members who have not participated in social labor, so that they can encourage their relatives to produce well, manage their housework well, and support the factory's production.
    Fellow representatives, our entire factory's workers and families have strong confidence and determination that under the wise leadership of the Party, we will definitely complete and overfulfill all the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state ahead of schedule and in excess. Let us join hands to fight for the completion and overfulfillment of the state's magnificent plan for 1959!
    Finally, I wish the conference a complete success and all representatives good health!

    从“锅台转”到“机器转”
    高凤琴代表谈一个工厂职工家属的大跃进主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理和李先念副总理的各项工作报告。周总理的报告给了我深刻的教育和极大的鼓舞，我一定按照报告的精神去工作，把我们工厂的家属工作做得更好。
    在去年大跃进中，职工家属苦干苦钻，参加各种生产，很多人由外行变成内行，给国家创造了二十万元的财富
    几年来，我们工厂的家属工作，在党的正确领导下，根据党的勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，在为工厂生产服务，搞好家庭互助和家庭“五好”等方面，做了不少工作，取得了一定成绩。特别是在一九五八年全面大跃进和人民公社化运动中，我厂家属在党的领导下，在全厂职工大闹技术革命用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法制造出了我国第一台氮肥设备，在劳动模范尉凤英用四个月的时间完成了第二个五年计划工作量等动人事迹的影响和鼓舞下，进一步克服了自卑感，破除迷信，解放思想，干劲冲天，大家决心为社会主义建设事业贡献出自己的力量，积极地参加了工厂大跃进中我们家属可以参加的各项劳动；举办了各种福利事业，使家属从琐碎的家务劳动里解放出来，“由锅台转走上了机器转”。到现在为止我们工厂的家属有一千零九十八名当了工厂的合同工，有七百多名在家属办的工厂里当工人，有九百多名参加了福利行业。这是一件了不起的大事情，是我们职工家属的一件大喜事。现在把我厂家属工作一年来的变化情况，向大会作个简单的汇报。
    当去年大跃进运动轰轰烈烈开展起来以后，我们家属也不落后，也同样的参加了大跃进运动，迅速的行动起来服从组织分配，党要我们到那里我们就到那里，叫我们做什么就做什么，例如：当工厂的某些原材料发生了困难的时候，全厂展开了“五挖运动”。我们家属立刻响应党委的号召，掀起了一个以挖钢铁为主的挖宝运动。大家积极性很高，从六、七岁的儿童到六、七十岁的老人都参加了人人争先、支援生产。只一个多月的时间就挖出钢铁二百五十四吨半，五金十一吨，耐火砖一千吨，木柴十二万斤，红砖七十万块，还有许多其他物资，仅钢、铁、铜、耐火砖等几项就给国家节约了四万五千四百一十二元的财富。又如：我们为了解决工厂劳动力不足的困难，组织家属帮助卸车，只用了四十分钟就卸完了一车皮砖，没有损坏一块，比男工完成的质量还好，受到领导上的表扬。
    党发出全党全民办工业和人民公社化运动的号召以后，我们在党委领导下，积极的举办了工厂，参加了工业生产劳动。党委为了领导我们把工厂办好，首先召开了工厂和家属干部会议，进行了辩论，明确了不少认识，并且确定了家属办工业必须大工厂帮助小工厂，小工厂为大工厂服务的原则。这就给了我们很大支持和鼓舞，因此，我们干劲很足，增强了克服困难的信心和决心，我们提出要因陋就简，白手起家，不向国家要钱，不向工厂要设备，自力更生的把生产搞起来。厂工会还组织全厂职工家属举行了比思想、比干劲、比办法的比武大会。职工家属干的热火朝天，不分昼夜的张罗，到处找废料、废物资、找活源，不懂的就去请教工人，不会的就请工人帮助。职工们对家属办工业也给了很大支援，他们利用业余时间帮助我们学习技术、盖房子、作计划。就这样我们在党的领导下，在职工们的帮助下，用我们自己拣来的旧废料盖起了厂房、食堂和托儿所十六处，共一千一百四十四平方公尺。举办了十一个小工厂（包括纸袋子、五金、铸造、水泥、木箱、纸盒、草袋子、缝纫等工厂）。在短短几个月的时间里，我们学会了木工、铸工、瓦工、车工、水泥工等技术，由外行变成了内行，并且给国家创造了二十万元的财富。职工们说：“家属们真能干，可不能再说家属光会带孩子、搞家务了。”
    家属参加社会劳动以后，摆脱家务和小孩的牵累就成了急需解决的问题。我们在党的领导和支持下，采取了大家动手，先分散后集中的方法，自办了一百三十四个托儿所，十五个食堂，四处服务站，基本上解决了家属参加社会劳动的困难。在办福利事业上，我们反对了“伸手要钱，你办我享”的依赖思想，采取因陋就简，因地制宜，不花钱或少花钱办好事的作法办起来的。例如盖食堂所用的木料，砖瓦和人工，直到吃饭用的家具等，完全是家属自己挖、拣、借、献的。托儿所用的房子都是家属自愿献的，白天做托儿所，晚上做宿舍，房子的女主人就是保育员。这些保育员都是我们根据思想好、热爱孩子的家属里选举出来的。她们耐心的关照孩子，让孩子们能吃好、玩好、睡好，培养了孩子们的集体生活习惯，保证了孩子妈妈安心工作、学习。托儿所用的一切家具也都是孩子的妈妈和家属们拿来的。
    服务站给家属解决了洗、缝、拆、补和代买生活日用品等困难。
    由于党领导我们妇女从琐碎的家务劳动走上了社会劳动，公社化给我们解决了参加社会劳动的困难，使家属在经济地位上，精神面貌上都起了很大变化。
    在家庭生活和经济地位方面，过去被人认为是吃人家饭的，自己在心里总觉得理屈。现在不但能养活自己，而且提高了家庭生活水平。根据八十六名参加社会劳动的家属调查，家庭人口有四百八十人，原来每人每月平均生活费是十三元，现在提高到十七点三五元。工厂救济费的支出也大大的减少了。很多经常困难户也不用救济了。
    共同劳动改善了人与人之间的关系，改变了人们的精神面貌
    家属的精神面貌也和过去大不相同。在政治上迫切要求进步，不少的人提出争取入党。例如合同工王丽英，过去是第四家属委员会委员，入厂后生产积极，听从组织分配，超额完成任务，并能帮助别人，去年底被评为先进生产者，她提出不骄不傲，继续锻炼自己，争取达到预备党员的水平。像这样的家属不是个别的。二十二车间一百八十名合同工里就有三十七名是先进生产者和红旗手。在家属办的工厂劳动的家属们干劲很足，以厂为家，早来晚走。在“三八”节大会上她们和工厂的职工比干劲，她们提出一年任务半年完。小五金厂做“铸顶子”，三月份计划指标是一千七百二十七公斤，实际完成了三千七百三十四公斤。过去家属到一起就扯东家长、西家短，因此，闹不团结。现在到一起就谈生产、学习。
    在家庭关系方面也有了变化，加强了婆媳之间、夫妻之间以及邻里之间的团结，闹家庭纠纷和闹邻里纠纷的现象大大减少了。在去年年初全厂婆媳不合的还有五十一户，现在已有四十二户改变了，建立了互相尊敬、互相帮助新的家庭关系。例如孟淑琴参加社会劳动后，主动的和婆婆说话，每月给婆婆几块零花钱，还常给老人买点吃的东西，老人很受感动，主动的带孩子照料家务，变成了和睦家庭。老太太到处说：“参加生产太好了，把我们家庭关系也闹好了，这都是党和毛主席领导的好。”
    整个家属无论在生产、生活、思想等各个方面都有了很大进步，这都是党领导的结果，我们感谢党的正确领导，我们高呼共产党万岁！
    我们家属虽然在党的领导下，在生产、生活、思想上有了不少进步，但是，我们的缺点还不少，工作中的问题还很多，我们决心在一九五九年大跃进中，全厂家属要更好的学习政治、文化、技术，提高建设社会主义的本领和共产主义觉悟，用实干、苦干加巧干的精神，大闹技术革命，大搞群众运动。依靠党的领导和职工的帮助，不向国家要材料、要设备，用土洋结合的办法，把我们现有的小工厂逐步地提高，更好的满足国家的需要。
    在搞好生产的同时，一定要把集体福利事业搞好，我们保证不向国家要钱、要东西，用我们自己的力量搞好食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业，更好的为生产服务，为群众服务。
    同时，还要把没有参加社会劳动的家属工作作好，使她们鼓励亲人好好生产，把家务料理好，支援工厂的生产。
    各位代表，我们全厂职工和家属有坚强的信心和决心，在党的英明领导下，一定能提前和超额完成党和国家交给我们的一切任务。让我们共同携起手来，为完成和超额完成国家一九五九年宏伟的计划而奋斗吧！
    最后，祝大会胜利成功，各位代表身体健康！
