Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th: TASS reported that on April 4th, the Soviet Foreign Ministry sent a note to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow regarding the violation of the flight regulations for air corridors from West Germany to Berlin by a U.S. "C-113" transport plane on March 27th. The note stated that the U.S. aircraft's deliberate violation of the existing regulations for air communication with Berlin makes it difficult not to believe that the United States is attempting to worsen the conditions for the Foreign Ministers' Conference, if not to fundamentally undermine the agreement already reached between East and West to hold negotiations. The note said that the U.S. plane deliberately ascended to a height of 7,000 meters in the airspace of the German Democratic Republic, despite the Soviet side having notified the U.S. Air Safety Representative in Berlin that the aforementioned aircraft should not fly above 3,500 meters.

The note also stated that on the same day, when the plane returned from Berlin to West Germany, it once again exceeded the normal flight altitude in the air corridor by a factor of two, despite the Soviet official representative protesting this violation of regulations to the U.S. representative.

The Soviet note pointed out that the U.S. government, through its ambassador in Moscow, had stated that it believed that unilateral actions by any government would not necessarily contribute to achieving the desired results of the conference during the preparation for the upcoming East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, the U.S. aircraft's violation of flight regulations occurred precisely after this statement.

The note pointed out that the Soviet side not only does not allow any actions that may worsen the situation on the eve of negotiations, but also will do its utmost to facilitate the holding of negotiations.

    苏联外交部照会美国
    美国破坏柏林空运的规定
    企图使外长会议条件恶化
    新华社莫斯科5日电　据塔斯社讯：苏联外交部4日就美国“C—一一三”型运输机在3月27日破坏关于自西德去柏林空中走廊飞行规定一事，向美国驻莫斯科大使馆发出照会。照会说，美国飞机蓄意破坏同柏林进行空中交往的现行规定，很难不使人认为，美国企图使外长会议的条件恶化，如果说，不是根本破坏东西方就举行谈判已经达成的协议的话。照会说，美国的这架飞机在德意志民主共和国的领空曾故意上升到七千公尺的高空，尽管苏联方面已经通知美国驻柏林的空中安全代表说，上述飞机飞行高度不得超过三千五百公尺。
  照会还说，这架飞机在当天从柏林返回西德的时候，再一次超过在空中走廊普通飞行高度的一倍，尽管苏联官方代表曾对这种破坏规定的作法向美国代表提出了抗议。
    苏联照会指出，美国政府曾通过其驻莫斯科大使声明，它认为，在准备即将召开的东西方外长会议期间，任何一国政府的片面行动都未必会有助于会议取得预定的结果，但是，美国飞机对飞行规定的破坏正是在这次声明之后发生的。
    照会指出，苏联方面不仅不容许在谈判前夕可能使局势恶化的任何作法，而且还要竭尽全力使谈判易于举行。
