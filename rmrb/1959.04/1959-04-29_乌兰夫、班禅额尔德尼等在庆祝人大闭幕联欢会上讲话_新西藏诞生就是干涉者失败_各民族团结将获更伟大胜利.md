Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Amidst national jubilation and universal celebration, over 10,000 representatives and people from all walks of life, encompassing more than forty nationalities, gathered at Zhongshan Park this evening for a grand celebration. They enthusiastically celebrated the victorious conclusion of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, the election of our national leaders led by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and the great unity of 600 million people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the leader of all nationalities.

    Before the evening's festivities began, a celebration meeting was held. Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, stated at the meeting that the convocation of this National People's Congress, of great historical significance, has further strengthened the unity of the people of all nationalities in our country and further inspired their soaring enthusiasm for building socialism. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the national leaders headed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, the people of all nationalities in our country will unite even more closely, fight heroically, and achieve a greater leap forward in 1959.

    Behold, the Tibetan serf system so strongly supported by imperialists and Indian interventionists will never return.
    Ulanhu said that the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary clique, instigated by British imperialism and foreign interventionists, has suffered a shameful defeat. The troops of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, after swiftly quelling the rebellion in Lhasa, have in one fell swoop wiped out the rebellion in the Shannan area of Tibet. We express our respect and condolences to the Tibet Military Region troops who swiftly quelled the rebellion, and our respect and condolences to the people of all circles and patriotic figures of all strata in Tibet who actively assisted the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion.

    Ulanhu concluded by saying that our victory is the defeat of imperialists and foreign interventionists. Let imperialists and foreign interventionists howl over their shameful defeat! The people of all nationalities in our country will be more closely united and make more courageous leaps forward in the great family of the motherland. Behold! The backward, cruel, dark, and reactionary Tibetan serf system, so strongly supported by imperialists and foreign interventionists, will never return. A infinitely beautiful democratic and socialist new Tibet will appear before us.

    The Tibetan people must carry out democratic reform, and Tibet must advance along the socialist road.
    Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, then spoke. He said, "Today is the day of the victorious closing of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. Please allow me to express my warm congratulations with extremely joyful feelings for the successful conclusion of this Congress, for the significant contributions this Congress has made to the great unity of the people of all nationalities in our country and to the great leap forward in 1959! And I would like to express my warm congratulations to the new leaders of our country elected by this Congress."

    Panchen Erdeni said, "I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our beloved Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the new national leaders, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, the people of all nationalities throughout the country will unite even more closely, and we will surely be able to achieve new and greater victories."

    Panchen Erdeni said that the Tibetan people, in the great family of the motherland, have now entered a new historical stage. The Tibetan people are full of confidence and are beginning to advance courageously towards the path of democracy and socialism. Recently, Indian expansionists, inheriting the mantle of British imperialism, supported a small handful of Tibetan reactionaries, undermined our country's unity, interfered in our internal affairs, and clamored wildly, openly exposing their arrogant ambitions. I want to warn them once again that the 650 million Chinese people are not to be bullied, and their delusions will never be realized. Tibet will always be China's Tibet, the Tibetan people must carry out democratic reform, Tibet must advance along the path of democracy and socialism, and Tibet will surely be rapidly built into a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

    Panchen Erdeni concluded his speech with the cheers: "Long live the unity of the great motherland and the unity of nationalities! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in China!"

    Under the leadership of the new national leaders, the people of all nationalities in our country will achieve greater victories.
    Apei Awang Jinmei, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, said that the First Session of the Second National People's Congress summarized the experiences of the great leap forward in socialist construction of the people of all nationalities in our country and issued a great call to march towards new victories. The resolution on the Tibetan issue passed at this Congress reflected the great victory in quelling the rebellion in Tibet. Thanks to the heroic fighting of the Tibet Military Region troops of the People's Liberation Army and the active support of the people of all nationalities throughout the country, the heinous conspiracy of a few Tibetan rebels colluding with British imperialists and Indian expansionists to undermine our country's unity was thoroughly smashed, further consolidating the great unity of the people of all nationalities in our country, and opening up a brilliant avenue for the Tibetan people to exercise national regional autonomy and democratic reform in the great family of the motherland and to move towards a happy socialist future. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the new national leaders, the people of all nationalities in our country will achieve greater victories.

    Saifuddin, Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said that he warmly congratulated Comrade Liu Shaoqi on his election as Chairman of the People's Republic of China and the election of other national leaders. We fully believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the national leaders headed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, and with the people of the whole country exerting their utmost efforts, the socialist construction cause of our country will surely achieve greater development.

    Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Premier and Secretary-General of the State Council, Wang Feng, Bao Erhan and other responsible persons of the Nationalities Affairs Commission and the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, Xu Bing and Ping Jiesan, Deputy Ministers of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, and others attended the celebration meeting.

    Also attending the celebration meeting were all the minority nationality representatives and members attending the National People's Congress and the CPPCC, as well as responsible persons from relevant provinces, cities, and autonomous regions.

    Also attending the celebration meeting were Xi Rao Jia Cuo and other responsible persons of the Buddhist Association of China.

    After the celebration meeting, the grand celebration began amidst the sound of music. Colorful lights shone in front of Zhongshan Hall. People wearing costumes of dozens of nationalities danced and sang between the Altar of Land and Grain and the green trees and floral shadows. Here, the "Axi Moon Dance" was being performed, and there, the "Korean Double Dance" was being danced. A circle composed of young people of all nationalities danced the "Youth Friendship Waltz". The large-scale Ping opera "Beside the Jinsha River" was performed at the Music Hall, and this story depicting the deep friendship between the Red Army and the Tibetan people deeply moved the audience. The storytelling and ballad performances in Zhongshan Hall constantly evoked laughter from the audience.

    The celebration evening proceeded in an atmosphere of unity and joy until late into the night. (Attached picture)

    乌兰夫、班禅额尔德尼等在庆祝人大闭幕联欢会上讲话
    新西藏诞生就是干涉者失败  各民族团结将获更伟大胜利
    新华社28日讯　在举国欢腾、全民皆庆的日子里，包括四十多个民族的各族各界代表和群众一万多人，今晚在中山公园举行盛大联欢会，热烈庆祝第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议胜利闭幕，庆祝以刘少奇主席为领导的我国国家领导人的当选，庆祝六亿人民在中国共产党和各族人民的领袖毛主席领导下的伟大团结。
    联欢晚会开始以前举行了庆祝大会。国务院副总理、民族事务委员会主任乌兰夫在会上讲话说，这次有重大历史意义的全国人民代表大会的召开，更加加强了我国各民族人民的团结，更加鼓舞了各民族人民建设社会主义的冲天干劲。我们深信，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在以刘少奇同志为首的国家领导人员的领导下，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我国各民族人民将更加团结一致，英勇奋斗，实现1959年的更大跃进。
    看吧，帝国主义和印度干涉者所极力支持的西藏农奴制将一去不复返
    乌兰夫说，英帝国主义和外国干涉者所策动的西藏反动集团的叛乱，已经遭到可耻的失败。人民解放军西藏军区部队，继迅速平息拉萨叛乱之后，又一举荡平了西藏山南地区的叛乱，我们对迅速平定叛乱的西藏军区部队表示敬意和慰问，对积极协助解放军平息叛乱的西藏僧俗各界人民和各阶层爱国人士表示敬意和慰问。
    乌兰夫最后说，我们的胜利，就是帝国主义和外国干涉者的失败。让帝国主义和外国干涉者为他们的可耻失败去嚎叫吧！我国各民族人民将在祖国大家庭中，更加亲密团结，更加奋勇跃进。看吧！帝国主义和外国干涉者所极力支持的落后的、残酷的、黑暗的、反动的西藏农奴制度将永远一去不复返了，一个无限美妙的民主和社会主义的新西藏将出现在我们的面前。
    西藏人民一定要实行民主改革，西藏一定要沿着社会主义道路前进
    西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼接着讲话。他说，今天是第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议胜利闭幕的日子，请允许我怀着极为高兴的心情，为这次大会圆满闭幕，为这次大会对我国各族人民大团结和1959年大跃进所作出的重大贡献，表示热烈祝贺！并且对这次大会选出的我们国家新的领导人表示热烈祝贺。
    班禅额尔德尼说，我深信，在中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席的领导下，在国家新的领导人的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全国各族人民一定会更加紧密地团结起来，我们一定能够取得新的更大的胜利。
    班禅额尔德尼说，在伟大祖国大家庭中的西藏人民，现在已经步入了一个新的历史阶段，西藏人民正在满怀信心，开始向着民主和社会主义道路奋勇前进。最近以来，印度扩张主义分子，继承英帝国主义的衣钵，支持一小撮西藏反动分子，破坏我国统一，干涉我国内政，疯狂地叫嚣，赤裸裸地暴露了他们狂妄的野心。我要再一次警告他们，六亿五千万中国人民不是好欺负的，他们的妄想是永远实现不了的。西藏永远是中国的西藏，西藏人民一定要进行民主改革，西藏一定要沿着民主和社会主义道路前进，西藏一定能够迅速建成为一个民主的社会主义的新西藏。
    班禅额尔德尼在结束他的讲话时高呼：伟大祖国的统一和民族团结万岁！中国共产党万岁！中国各族人民伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    在新的国家领导人的领导下，我国各族人民将取得更大胜利
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美讲话说，第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议总结了我国各族人民社会主义建设大跃进的经验，发出了向新胜利大进军的伟大号召。在这次大会上通过的关于西藏问题的决议，反映了平定西藏叛乱的伟大胜利。由于人民解放军西藏军区部队的英勇作战和全国各族人民的积极支援，彻底粉碎了西藏少数叛乱分子勾结英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子破坏我国统一和团结的罪恶阴谋，更加巩固了我国各族人民的伟大统一和团结，开辟了西藏人民在祖国大家庭里实行民族地方自治和民主改革并且向美满的社会主义的灿烂大道迈进。我坚信，在中国共产党和伟大的毛主席的英明领导下，在新的国家领导人的领导下，我国各族人民将取得更大的胜利。
  新疆维吾尔自治区主席赛福鼎讲话说，我热烈祝贺刘少奇同志当选为中华人民共和国主席以及其他国家领导人的当选。我们完全相信在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下、在以刘少奇同志为首的国家领导人的领导下、在全国人民鼓足干劲的情况下，我们国家社会主义建设事业一定会得到更大的发展。

    庆祝大会结束后，盛大的联欢会在乐曲声中开始了。中山堂前彩灯明亮，穿着几十种民族盛装的人们，在社稷坛和绿树花影之间，载歌载舞，这里欢舞着“阿西跳月”，那里跳起“朝鲜族双人舞”，一个由各族青年组成的圈子，跳的是“青年友谊圆舞”。音乐堂演出了大型评剧“金沙江畔”，这个描写红军和藏胞深厚情谊的故事，深深激动了观众。中山堂里的说唱曲艺，不断引起观众的笑声。
