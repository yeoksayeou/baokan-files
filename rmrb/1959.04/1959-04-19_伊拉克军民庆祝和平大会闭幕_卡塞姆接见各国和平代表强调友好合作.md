The parade began at 9:30 this morning. The police band led the way. The procession passed through the long Rashid Street. The street was crowded with people, and the windows, balconies, and rooftops of the buildings on both sides of the street were filled with people. They not only watched the parade but also shouted slogans with the marchers and enthusiastically cheered the demonstrators.

The demonstrators held up pictures of Prime Minister Kassem and many banners. The banners read "Long Live World Peace," "Long Live Freedom," "Down with Imperialism," and "Friendship with Peace-Loving People of All Countries." They also held up many green flags with doves painted on them. Some cartoons depicted an ugly hand waving bombs being grabbed by fighting people.

　　卡塞姆接见各国和平代表强调友好合作
    新华社巴格达17日电　巴格达人民今天举行盛大的示威游行庆祝伊拉克第二次和平战士代表大会闭幕。
    世界和平理事会代表团和其它外国的和平代表站在伊拉克国防部附近一座建筑物的阳台上观看示威游行。伊拉克各省和平组织的代表以及和平战士委员会委员们参加了示威游行。参加游行的还有军官和士兵、摩苏尔人民代表团、各人民团体的成员、政府职员以及来自巴格达以外地区的农民等。
    游行从今天九点三十分开始。警察乐队走在最前面。游行队伍穿过长长的拉希德大街。大街上挤满了人，大街两旁建筑物的窗户、阳台和屋顶都站满了人。他们不仅观看游行，同时也同游行的人一起高呼口号，并且热情地向示威者欢呼。
    示威者高举着卡塞姆总理的像片和许多横幅。横幅上写着“世界和平万岁”、“自由万岁”、“打倒帝国主义”、“同爱好和平的各国人民友好”等口号。他们还高举着许多画有和平鸽的绿色旗帜。有些漫画画着一只挥舞着炸弹的丑恶的手被斗争着的人民抓住。
    卡塞姆曾经到国防部门口向示威的人致意。他受到人民热烈的欢呼和鼓掌。
    新华社巴格达17日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆今天下午在接见世界和平理事会和其它外国的和平代表时说，“巴格达过去是帝国主义制造阴谋的中心，但是现在它已经成为和平的基地。”
    卡塞姆总理代表伊拉克政府和人民对这些和平代表参加伊拉克第二次和平战士代表大会表示欢迎。他在同代表们进行的一个多小时的谈话中说，“我国政府是和我国人民站在一起的，所以我们共享人民的欢乐。你们和平代表参加了我们今天的示威游行。这次示威游行表明了巴格达现在是中东的和平堡垒。这个堡垒和全世界其它堡垒是分不开的。”
    他继续说，“我们将同一切爱好和平的人们合作，同兄弟般的阿拉伯国家合作，同共同为争取世界和平而斗争的其它友好国家合作。”
    卡塞姆总理说，“我国人民是勇敢的并且已经觉醒，他们将永远不向任何敌人屈服。伊拉克人民正在建设他们可爱的共和国。我国将变得强大和繁荣起来。我们根据和平共处的原则同各国人民合作，努力争取世界的持久和平。”
